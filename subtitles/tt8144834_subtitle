1
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,450
Aspiring lawyers, good morning.

2
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,040
A small reality check.

3
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,290
In fact in my book its rule no. 1.

4
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,580
That Law is not equal to Justice.

5
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,410
Justice is an ideal.

6
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,580
Law is a tool to get there.

7
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,250
Sometimes..

8
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,410
Rule no. 2. You stop paying
attention when you start writing.

9
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,200
You'd be surprised to know..

10
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,830
..how many lawyers have
messed up cross-examinations.

11
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,750
Because they were too busy taking
notes while the witness was testifying.

12
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,290
And rule no. 3.

13
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,160
Never fall in love with the Law.

14
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,000
It is a jealous mistress.

15
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,540
And one day it will disappoint you.

16
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,160
Yes?

17
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:34,290
I am sorry sir, but being a Lawyer,
how can you even say that?

18
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,540
Listening helps.

19
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:41,500
Okay. The year 2012, the Nirbhaya Case.

20
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,870
One of the five accused was a minor.

21
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,330
Only a couple of months were
left for him to turn an adult.

22
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,620
And he was by far the
most brutal of the lot.

23
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,870
The wounds he inflicted on the victim..

24
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,790
..were primarily
responsible for her death.

25
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,370
While the case was still being heard,
he turned 18.

26
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:06,080
The entire country wanted him
to be tried as an adult and hanged.

27
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:07,700
But the Law..

28
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:12,830
The Law demanded that he should
be tried at a juvenile court as a Minor.

29
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,200
And he was released after
serving 3 years in jail.

30
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,160
All the rest were hanged.

31
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,620
So..

32
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:23,040
The question is was the Law upheld?

33
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,250
Sure it was.

34
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,330
Was Justice Done?

35
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,500
Yes?

36
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,410
Sir, what do you believe?

37
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,910
Me? I am all for the Law.

38
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,160
Justice is abstract.

39
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,830
Law is a fact.

40
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,750
When will you return?

41
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,660
I don't know mom.

42
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,330
Did he get bowled?

43
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,160
Hey..

44
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:13,700
Did he get bowled?

45
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:22,580
See you, father.

46
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,290
Will you be home soon?

47
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,040
Not sure.

48
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:41,160
Hey, Madhuri. Where to?

49
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,660
Madhuri?

50
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,370
More like Anjali the cleaning lady.

51
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,620
- Rohan sir.
- He's inside.

52
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,450
Good morning, sir.

53
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,870
Meera ma'am sent me over..

54
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,580
..to show you the costumes
for shoot day after.

55
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,950
Sit.

56
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:19,250
Sit here.

57
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,410
Here's the jacket.

58
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,040
One piece..

59
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,000
- Savi!
- Yes.

60
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,790
There is money and a list on the table.
Get these things from the market.

61
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,250
Sir this..

62
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,750
Sir, here's the black jacket.

63
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,040
I asked for see-through.

64
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,370
But this is see-through.

65
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,540
Wear it and show.

66
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,580
Anjali.

67
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,500
Anjali.

68
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:43,790
Anju..

69
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:48,750
Anju..

70
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,040
What happened?

71
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,080
Hey!

72
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:57,330
What happened?

73
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,290
Speak up.

74
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:02,830
Speak..

75
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,540
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon, sir.

76
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,950
- Is the lighting in place?
- Still in process.

77
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,700
Tell the cameraman to save his
award-winning perfection for the next film.

78
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,290
- I need time with my actors.
- Okay, sir.

79
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:25,750
- Dutta, send some tea.
- Yes, sir.

80
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:31,000
Jasbeer, I see you signing
cheques all day but to what avail?

81
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,040
I don't get a single requirement I need.

82
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,200
In return, he'll just give a dry smile.

83
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,000
Good afternoon, sir.

84
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,080
What is this?

85
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,410
What is this?

86
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,950
Didn't I clearly say
I need pure silk sari?

87
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,410
- Yes, sir.
- Then what is this flimsy material?

88
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:01,290
- Sir, I thought..
- You thought.

89
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:03,790
She thought?

90
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,290
Who told you to think?

91
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,040
What on earth is going on here?

92
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,500
Seriously, what is going on?

93
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,330
Production never gets
any of the requirements.

94
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:16,620
The cameraman takes an entire
day to finish his lighting rig.

95
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,040
And Costume is getting
me rags from the railway tracks.

96
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:22,580
Am I the only as****
trying to make a film here?

97
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,450
Meera..

98
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,330
Out.

99
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,120
- Rohan, I need her.
- Use that other girl.

100
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,700
That..Anjali.

101
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,870
- She didn't show up today.
- I don't care.

102
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,450
Manage.

103
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,040
That's enough makeup.

104
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:40,700
Rolling Camera.

105
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,410
- Camera.
- Rolling.

106
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,330
Action!

107
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:46,450
You knew Zahir is a wanted gangster.

108
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:49,120
He's wanted for extortion
and murder cases.

109
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,330
He had a wife and kids
long before you two met.

110
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,450
Cut it.

111
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:08,870
Stop all this. Come on.

112
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,290
Stop the shooting. Let's go.

113
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:29,620
I need very strong feminine
imagery connecting to the title.

114
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:30,790
You know what..

115
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:38,830
Do a hand sketch of the
protagonist's facial profile.

116
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,950
Kohl-lined eyes and plaited hair curving
outward forming the title "Caged".

117
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:45,160
- Yeah!
- Sure.

118
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,290
Okay.

119
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:50,660
Yeah, Dutta.

120
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,750
Are you serious?

121
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:03,370
But why?

122
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,410
The female doctor is not
available for the next two days.

123
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,700
I will do the assault history
and physical examination.

124
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:26,830
Do I have your consent?

125
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,950
There will be a female Police officer..

126
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,120
..and a Nurse present
during the examination.

127
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,620
Do I have your consent?

128
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,950
Why call me if we don't have her consent?
I am already under a lot of work pressure.

129
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,700
I left two bodies in autopsy for this.

130
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:41,290
Without the examination,
our case will fall weak.

131
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,830
This will take time..

132
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,950
..and minor injuries can heal.

133
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,290
The swelling in your private
part might go away too.

134
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:49,450
It will be all the more
difficult to detect a sperm..

135
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,450
You've my consent.

136
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:53,870
Sign here.

137
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,370
Witness signature.

138
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,910
Are you her mother?

139
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,370
We will need your signature as well.

140
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:13,410
Take your time, and answer
every question I ask correctly.

141
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,040
If the examination
and statement don't match..

142
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,540
..then the case will turn
in the favour of the accused.

143
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,750
When did it happen?

144
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,870
- Morning.
- Time?

145
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,000
Around 11-ish.

146
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,200
How many persons?

147
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:29,580
Its routine procedure.

148
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:31,750
One.

149
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,750
Did you knew the accused?

150
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,250
Yes.

151
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,000
- Are you married?
- No.

152
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,120
When did you have your last periods?

153
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,870
Two weeks ago.

154
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:47,410
Were you sexually active
before the assault?

155
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:49,950
It's important.

156
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,950
Yes, I was.

157
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,000
Ever had an abortion done?

158
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,080
No.

159
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,450
Did you clean up after the assault?

160
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:10,370
Pass urine, or stool, etcetera.

161
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,790
She told me not to.

162
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,080
Were you wearing these clothes?

163
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,830
- Yes.
- Undergarments?

164
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,790
- Did you tell her that all this
will be sent to forensics? - Yes.

165
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,910
- Do you have clean clothes?
- Yes.

166
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,200
Did you resist during the assault?

167
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,290
I did.

168
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,120
Did you tug his hair,
bite, or scratch him?

169
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,660
- What..
- I pushed him..pulled his hair..

170
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,160
Hold on. Hold on.

171
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,620
You pushed him, pulled his hair..

172
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,750
- What else?
- Maybe even clawed his back.

173
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,660
- Maybe?
- Yes.

174
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,250
Maybe..

175
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,330
Did he penetrate you with his penis?

176
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,200
Please wait outside.

177
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:57,080
No. I am staying put.

178
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,950
- Did he?
- Yes.

179
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,000
Any other object used for penetration?

180
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,000
No.

181
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,700
What was the position after the assault?

182
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,750
I was underneath him.

183
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,160
Any other position?

184
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,500
No.

185
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,660
Did he ejaculate?

186
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,620
Do men stop before that?

187
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,000
Now undress yourself.

188
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,330
You don't get it.

189
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:46,870
Commissioner Roy is
a good friend of mine.

190
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,290
Hand over my phone
and let me talk to him.

191
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,330
Sir!

192
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:51,450
It's a small medical
examination and won't take long.

193
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,000
- Please cooperate.
- No, I won't cooperate.

194
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,330
I won't budge another inch.

195
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,410
Give me my damn phone.
I want to talk to Mr. Roy.

196
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,080
Is he crazy? Knock some sense into him.

197
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,370
Your will doesn't count here.

198
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,870
- This is the procedure.
- Go explain your procedure to the one..

199
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,450
..who filed this fake
case in the first place.

200
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,160
Give me my phone and
let me talk to Mr. Roy.

201
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:07,410
- You want your phone?
- Yes.

202
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:37,540
'Yet another skeleton has
stumbled out of Bollywood's closet.'

203
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,660
'Popular Film Director Rohan
Khurana was arrested tonight..'

204
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:44,370
'..on the charges of raping
one of his team members.'

205
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,330
'Empowerment is about
financial independence..'

206
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:48,200
'..but if women are getting
raped at their workplaces..'

207
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:49,830
'..what empowerment
are we talking about.'

208
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,790
'If you take a peek in people's homes..'

209
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:54,910
'..you will realise that women
are not safe even in their homes.'

210
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,080
'It's not just about Bollywood,
but the entire job sector's dilemma.'

211
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,750
'Take any sector.'

212
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:02,410
'In fact, we've seen cases of sexual
harassment even in our judiciary.'

213
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:06,540
Punish the rape culprit!

214
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,700
"Save our daughter! Save our daughter!"

215
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,660
"Save our daughter! Save our daughter!"

216
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,700
"Save our daughter! Save our daughter!"

217
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,830
"Save our daughter! Save our daughter!"

218
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,620
This is the scene outside the
Kala Ghoda session's court.

219
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,450
Once again Mumbai has come
together to defend its daughter.

220
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:26,200
We must wait and watch to see if the
state's judiciary does justice or not.

221
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,540
According to our sources..

222
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:31,500
..the session's court can
announce its verdict any minute..

223
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,000
..for the rape charges against
the accused Rohan Khurana.

224
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,250
In rape cases, the victim's statement..

225
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:48,200
..is considered solid evidence
to impose a conviction.

226
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:54,370
The real test is whether the statement
inspires the court's confidence or not.

227
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:58,950
In this case, the court has
found that the statement of PW1..

228
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:04,000
..Anjali Vasudev Dangle fully inspires
the confidence of the judicial mind.

229
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:09,000
The medical report of the accused
supports the victim's statement.

230
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:13,790
The DNA test further confirms the
presence of the sperm of the accused..

231
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:16,080
..in the vaginal cavity of the victim.

232
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:21,120
Thus the prosecution has clearly established
the guilt of the accused..

233
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,910
..under section 376 IPC.

234
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,160
The accused, Rohan Ravi Khurana..

235
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:30,040
..is sentenced to 10 years
of rigorous imprisonment.

236
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,910
I didn't rape anyone, Kainaz.

237
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:50,450
The DNA report has been manipulated.

238
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,660
Please believe me.

239
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,790
'Film Director Rohan Khurana..'

240
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:24,120
'..was sentenced to 10 years
of rigorous imprisonment..'

241
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:27,160
'..by the Mumbai session's
court for raping a crew member.'

242
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:30,160
'The court found the filmmaker
guilty on all counts, including rape.'

243
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,370
'The verdict is being
hailed as a major victory..'

244
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,500
'..for women's rights movement
against sexual abuse..'

245
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,620
'I hope that more women will
come forward post this verdict..'

246
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,620
'..and expose the mistreatment
they have to suffer.'

247
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,040
'I think the India MeeToo
movement has begun..'

248
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,830
'..and according to me,
this is just the tip of the iceberg.'

249
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,370
Yeah..

250
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:57,540
Morning sir.

251
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,200
Tarun Saluja. Please.

252
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:03,410
Obviously, I heard about the conviction.

253
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:08,500
It's all over the news.

254
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,200
As if they have run
out of every other content.

255
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:14,910
The ugly side of fame, I guess.

256
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:18,450
I am sure you are going
to apply in the High Court.

257
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,870
This is why I am here.

258
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:22,330
- I was hoping that..
- Is that the case file?

259
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:23,950
Yes.

260
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:35,330
Let me go through and let
you know if I can file the appeal.

261
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:38,750
I will understand if you
don't want to get involved.

262
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:41,660
No, that's not what I meant.

263
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,330
It's just that,
these high profile cases..

264
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:48,080
..they pay for the pro-bono work
that I do for the lesser privileged.

265
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:50,040
My fee will be high.

266
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,830
But..often the facts
of the case are so damaging..

267
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:59,120
..that even the best
lawyer can't be of any help.

268
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,750
If my opinion of this case is the same..

269
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:05,870
..then I'll advise you to go
with someone less expensive.

270
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:07,620
Money is not an issue.

271
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:13,250
Let me study it.
And I'll get back to you.

272
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:53,540
It's the wife I feel bad for.

273
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,950
Husbands make mistakes,
and the wife has to suffer.

274
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:01,330
Why do you look at
me while saying that?

275
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:08,370
You've been engrossed in Rohan
Khurana's file for the last five hours.

276
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,830
Why should I not be worried?

277
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:14,910
Stop worrying and listen to this.
You will definitely laugh at this.

278
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:18,040
His semen was found in woman's body.

279
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,000
The DNA test confirms that it is his.

280
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:25,250
Yet..the defence claims
that he has not even touched her.

281
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,950
I know why you take these cases.

282
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:33,910
And I love you and respect
you for what you do.

283
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:36,700
But the man is a convicted rapist.

284
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:39,700
Don't you think in the current
scenario it's not right to defend him.

285
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:45,200
Rights and wrongs
keep changing with time.

286
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,080
Even a convicted rapist
has the constitutional right..

287
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,450
..to a proper legal defence.

288
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,040
Imagine a system without that.

289
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,500
Throwing anyone behind bars.

290
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,370
No trial, no defence.

291
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,500
It did happen once.

292
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,950
It's called the emergency.

293
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:11,290
You know..the media will roast you.

294
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,330
Not to mention Roshini's growing up.

295
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:16,870
Roshini is just 8-years-old.
She watches Cartoon Network..

296
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,200
.. not the news.

297
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:20,040
By the way, where is the chatterbox.

298
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:23,370
Stereotypical absent father.

299
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:26,200
She is over at Tapur-Tupur's
place for a sleepover.

300
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:30,120
Tapur-Tupur, these are actual people?

301
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,870
They are her classmates, Tarun.

302
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,330
The Mukherjee twins.

303
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:36,830
What?

304
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,040
No. Don't change the subject.

305
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,750
Even I want twins.

306
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,700
Let's make some twins.

307
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,910
One Tapur, two Tupurs.

308
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,250
You don't get to sex your
way out of this one, okay.

309
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,580
No!

310
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,410
Hello.

311
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,330
Okay.

312
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:13,370
Rohan Khurana inflicted
wounds on himself..

313
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:15,450
..by ramming his head
against his cell's wall.

314
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:38,660
Mr. Khurana.

315
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,870
Tarun Saluja.

316
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,950
Thanks for meeting me.

317
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:45,290
Please don't repeat last
night's episode ever again.

318
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,120
Judges..

319
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:51,160
They don't like
temperamental convicts.

320
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:56,660
I'll be very honest with you. The only
reason I am interested is because..

321
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:02,120
..I've never seen such an absurd
defence in my entire career.

322
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:06,250
But..our conversation today..

323
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:10,500
..will decide whether
I take up your case or not.

324
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:14,080
Okay.
Now tell me exactly what happened.

325
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:16,410
I've already given my statement.

326
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,120
And the court's already sentenced
you to 10 years of imprisonment.

327
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,910
DNA report is manipulated.

328
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,540
Human semen is not an element..

329
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:33,950
..that can be easily manipulated,
by the Police or anyone else.

330
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,700
Stop wasting your money and my time.

331
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:43,500
Whenever you're ready,
ask your wife to call me.

332
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:47,500
Sir.

333
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,750
Help me.

334
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,410
Get me out of here.

335
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,660
Then tell me all the details.

336
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,790
Leave it to me how
to present them in court.

337
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:04,500
I will tell you everything.

338
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:10,290
But I won't admit anything in court..

339
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,620
..in front of my wife.

340
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:18,410
I will try it never comes to that.

341
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:24,540
Now, tell me everything.

342
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:49,330
IPC 376, subsection 2..

343
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:54,290
..clauses F and K to be read with
the India Evidence Act section 114 A.

344
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,830
If the accused is in power or
authority exceeding that of the woman..

345
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:01,830
..and sexual intercourse
is established between them..

346
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,290
..and if the woman claims in court..

347
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,200
..that whatever happened
was without her consent..

348
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:09,080
..then the court will believe
that her consent wasn't involved.

349
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,660
Jesus Christ.

350
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,290
But this is against
every legal principle.

351
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,120
Because the burden of proof
is always on the prosecution.

352
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:18,540
But, in this case
it's on the accused..

353
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,750
..which makes it easy to misuse.

354
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,250
I've filed an appeal
in the High Court.

355
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,620
The matter should
be coming up for hearing very soon.

356
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,040
Is there any hope?

357
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:36,160
The Law is strict,
and usually favours the victims..

358
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:37,910
..but in this case,
there are some aspects in this case..

359
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,330
..which haven't been explored yet.

360
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:43,120
So..yes, there is hope.

361
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,500
You will have to be very strong,
Mrs. Khurana.

362
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,620
Things can get very
ugly in a courtroom.

363
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:57,330
It can't get any uglier
then it already is.

364
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,120
Mr. Saluja, if I..

365
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:03,370
- Do you think he really..
- Don't.

366
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,120
Never ask me that question.

367
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:09,410
Have you guys checked the roster?
Who is my judge?

368
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:12,160
It's most likely
a two-judges bench, sir.

369
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:15,000
Justice Indrani Bhaskar,
Tolerant and Liberal.

370
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:17,450
And then we have Justice
Sanskari Madgaonkar.

371
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,580
No nonsense approach
and high conviction rate.

372
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,830
And the prosecutor?

373
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:22,450
Hiral Gandhi, sir.

374
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:25,250
She is fiery,
ambitious, impeccable record.

375
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:27,000
She is a torch-bearer
for women's rights.

376
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:29,870
In fact, word around
the Bar Council is that..

377
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:32,580
..she will be Maharashtra's
first female Advocate General.

378
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Really?

379
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,830
Anjali.

380
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:16,620
Will you be able to repeat
everything you said in court?

381
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,540
Tell me?

382
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:24,660
Madam, when will this end?

383
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:26,870
It will be over soon.

384
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:31,500
If she testifies like this in the court
then it shall all end pretty soon.

385
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,450
She has already
said it a dozen times.

386
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:36,160
How many times will she
have to repeat her ordeal again?

387
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:40,620
Anjali's statement
holds a lot of value.

388
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,040
The entire case depends on it.

389
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,200
She can't stop crying..

390
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:47,790
..every time she repeats
her painful experience.

391
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,750
- Just one last time.
- That's what I was told.

392
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:58,040
One last time to the Police.
Then to the doctor.

393
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:01,910
Then..at the court.

394
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,370
"Save our daughters."

395
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,000
"Save our daughters."

396
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:11,660
- "Rohan Khurana..
- Is a monster!"

397
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:15,250
- "Rohan Khurana..
- Is a monster!"

398
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:17,370
- Tarun Saluja..
- Down-Down.

399
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,660
- Tarun Saluja..
- Down-Down.

400
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,000
How are you?

401
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,500
Fine.

402
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,000
And you?

403
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,290
Wish me luck.

404
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,700
Criminal Appeal no.
347 and 129 of 2018.

405
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:39,000
Rohan Ravi Khurana
Vs State of Maharashtra.

406
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:42,290
Your honours, this is an
urgent application for bail..

407
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:45,700
..and appeal against an
order dated 7 September, 2018

408
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:49,580
Passed by the honourable Session's court,
convicting Mr. Rohan Ravi Khurana..

409
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,870
..for the alleged rape
of Ms. Anjali Dangle.

410
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,250
Opening statements, Ms. Gandhi.

411
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,500
Your honours,
in every twenty minutes..

412
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:04,330
..some woman is faced
with rape in this country.

413
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:07,700
According to a report from
the National Crime Records Bureau..

414
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:13,370
..in 98% of the cases, the
rapist is someone known to the victim

415
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:17,330
After the dreadful
Nirbhaya Rape case in 2012..

416
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:20,660
..when Criminal Law Amendment
Act 2013 was issued..

417
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:24,200
..the world was of the opinion that
we'll see a fall in the number of rapes.

418
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:28,120
But shockingly, compared to 2012..

419
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:33,450
..the number of reported rape
cases in 2017 saw an alarming rise.

420
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:38,450
What is more worrying is
that rate of conviction is mere 25%

421
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:44,290
Meaning in 75% rape cases
the accused never gets convicted.

422
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,950
They just walk free.

423
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:49,790
This has led to India being
called the rape nation of the world.

424
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:57,410
Popular Film Director Rohan Ravi Khurana
is privileged as well as powerful.

425
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:00,790
And this prosecution will prove
without an iota of doubt..

426
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:04,500
..that he blatantly misused
his position and power..

427
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,500
..to abuse Anjali Dangle,
who is from a backward class..

428
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:17,250
..and working as a junior costume
assistant in your film...

429
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:20,830
This was Anjali Dangle's
life before 8th July.

430
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,330
And this is Anjali
on the night of 8th July.

431
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:32,790
After the so called talented
and progressive Rohan Ravi Khurana..

432
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:35,700
..committed the savage
act of rape on her.

433
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:38,250
Your Honours,
the honourable session's court..

434
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:41,000
..has rightly convicted
Rohan Ravi Khurana..

435
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:44,080
..under section 375, 376..

436
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:49,000
..340, 342, 354,
and 506 of the IPC.

437
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,910
And sentenced him to 10
years rigorous imprisonment.

438
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,290
And I am convinced
that after reviewing..

439
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:57,910
..the overwhelming medical
and forensic evidence against him..

440
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,620
..the honourable High Court will uphold
the judgement of the Session's court.

441
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:12,080
And while we were arguing, another
woman in some part of the county..

442
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:14,660
..has fallen prey to
the heinous crime of rape.

443
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,500
Thank you.

444
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:18,160
Defence Council.

445
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:21,000
Your Honours.

446
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:25,620
I must say that I envy the passion
with which my young colleague speaks.

447
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:31,160
I do not however envy the utter
ignorance with which she speaks.

448
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:35,330
There is no room for emotional
statements in any courtroom.

449
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:37,330
Lawyers should stick to the facts.

450
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,750
And the facts are these.

451
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,700
The rape rate in India is 1.8..

452
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:47,620
Which mean 1.8 women
out of a million..

453
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:51,330
..might have to face rape.

454
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:57,830
And the figures in the most advanced
nation in this world is 27.3%

455
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,700
15% higher compared to India.

456
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:04,500
India comes on no.
46 on the global rape index.

457
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:07,330
Conviction rate is 25%

458
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:12,700
And the country that
ruled us for 200 years..

459
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,950
..has a conviction rate of only 7%

460
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:22,750
So Ms. Gandhi,
don't tell me in this court..

461
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:26,870
..that my country is the
rape capital of the world.

462
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:33,540
As a proud and informed India,
it's painful.

463
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,160
Mr. Saluja..

464
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:38,200
Opening statement can't
be turned into an argument.

465
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:39,910
I seek to Court's forgiveness.

466
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:45,450
Your Honours, Ms. Gandhi
wants the court to be concerned..

467
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:50,500
..that only 25% of rape accused
in our country are found guilty.

468
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:55,500
But why shouldn't it be our concern..

469
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:00,000
..that 75% are found innocent..

470
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:05,540
..after a full judicial process.

471
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,290
She uses the phrase "They walk free".

472
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,830
My Honours, can any man
having being accused of rape..

473
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,160
..ever walk free.

474
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,750
The defence will prove..

475
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:25,200
..that neither the fact
were duly examined..

476
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:28,660
..nor the witnesses
cross-examined thoroughly.

477
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:30,540
Further more.

478
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:36,330
Crucial evidence was mishandled and
the chain of custody was compromised.

479
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:43,160
The act of rape was never committed
on the person of Anjali Dangle.

480
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:49,250
The defence will prove that the case
of Rohan Ravi Khurana Vs The State..

481
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:56,950
..is a classic example
of a woman using as a weapon..

482
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,870
..the very law that
was made to protect her.

483
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:03,620
Thank you.

484
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,160
The court will take a short recess.

485
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:10,830
- Ms. Gandhi, you can begin your
examination with chief after that. - Yes.

486
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:21,830
May I?

487
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:24,290
Sure, sir.

488
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,500
I haven't seen you in months.
How are you?

489
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:29,660
I am fine. And you.

490
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,040
Take a look for yourself.

491
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,750
How is ma'am?

492
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,790
She is fine.

493
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:38,540
I am surprised she
let you defend this case.

494
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,950
The case is still in process.

495
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:47,160
Opening statements
were quite powerful.

496
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:50,160
We've trained you well.

497
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,580
Are you looking to cash in a favour.

498
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:55,450
By asking me to give in.

499
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,790
Right now I'll settle for some lunch.

500
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,750
I am sorry. Please.

501
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,160
Looks good.

502
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:06,330
Did Sumit cook this?

503
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:09,330
Like always, there are
two meanings to your statements.

504
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:11,700
Either I am a bad cook..

505
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:13,870
..or you are checking
my relationship status.

506
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:15,250
Both.

507
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:20,750
Sumit did cook this,
but we don't live together anymore.

508
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:24,660
Progressive husband plus a good cook
is a rare combination, Ms. Gandhi.

509
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:28,370
Some cases should be
settled out of court as well.

510
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:31,200
If you miss bed tea
even a single day..

511
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:34,660
..it doesn't take long for a progressive
husband to become conservative.

512
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,290
That is true.

513
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:46,250
Your Honours, the Prosecution would
like to call PW1, Anjali Vasudev Dangle.

514
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,580
Anjali Dangle.

515
00:40:54,580 --> 00:41:01,000
Anjali, please tell the court what
happened on the morning of 8th July.

516
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,580
The case will be heard in camera.

517
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:08,410
Only the people concerned
with the case will stay.

518
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,660
The rest may please
leave the courtroom.

519
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,790
Please..

520
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:25,040
I did go to Mr.
Rohan Khurana's house..

521
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:27,370
..to show him the costumes.

522
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,700
What date was it?

523
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,250
8th July.

524
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:34,000
Did you go willingly?

525
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:37,290
No. Meera ma'am asked me to.

526
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:42,120
Your Honours, Meera Singh
is Anjali Dangle's senior colleague..

527
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:45,250
..and designer Natasha Malhotra's
chief assistant as well.

528
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:50,450
What time did you reach
at the accused's home on 8th July?

529
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:53,250
Around 11-ish.

530
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:56,790
- Rohan sir?
- Yes. Come in.

531
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:03,830
Sir, Meera ma'am sent me over to show
you the costumes for the next shoot.

532
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:05,160
Sit.

533
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:06,870
Sit here.

534
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:24,540
- Savi!
- Yes.

535
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:26,700
There's money and a list on
the table. Get them from the market.

536
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:36,660
- I asked for see through.
- It is see through.

537
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,620
Wear it for me.

538
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I kept saying no, kept resisting..

539
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:12,040
..but he didn't listen.

540
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:15,450
I pushed him, but he hit me back.

541
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:20,620
What happened after that, Anjali?

542
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,540
He grabbed me by
my belt and dragged me.

543
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:10,870
After that I just lay there.

544
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:39,830
Your Honours,
Anjali Dangle's medical reports.

545
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:41,410
This clearly states..

546
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:46,040
..that presence of semen and male
pubic hair in victim's private parts.

547
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:49,870
And states injuries to
her face and other body parts.

548
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:51,910
Including inner thighs.

549
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:56,040
The DNA report also confirms..

550
00:44:56,540 --> 00:45:01,410
..that the DNA of the semen and the male
pubic hair found on the victim's body..

551
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:05,450
..is an exact match with
that of the accused Rohan Khurana.

552
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,200
Meera Singh.

553
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:13,160
- Were you chief assistant
with Natasha Malhotra? - Yes.

554
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:16,540
Please tell the honourable
court what you know.

555
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:20,910
Well, few weeks before the incident,
we were shooting.

556
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:25,830
I sent Anjali in Rohan Khurana's
van for some costume related query.

557
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,410
Finally when she came out her hair
was ruffled, her clothes were unsettled.

558
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:34,580
And she dashed straight to the bathroom
instead of returning on the set.

559
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:36,330
Okay. Thank you.

560
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:43,370
Your Honours,
Rohan Khurana is a serial predator..

561
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:47,830
..who takes advantage of his power and
position and preys on girls beneath him..

562
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:50,370
..by sexually harassing
and assaulting them.

563
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:53,790
And this fact should be considered
an aggravating circumstance..

564
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:55,870
..that this has become
a force of habit for him,

565
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,080
So I pray to the honourable court..

566
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,750
..to please uphold the
judgement of the session's court.

567
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:05,200
Grant the accused a minimum
sentence of 20 years. Thank you.

568
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:08,080
- Your honours, the defence would like to..
- One minute..

569
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:12,660
Mr. Saluja, if you don't mind,
I would like to recess for lunch.

570
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:16,080
We'll meet here by 2:30. Okay.

571
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,790
Court stands in recess.

572
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:18,620
Justice!

573
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:20,160
- I want..
- Justice!

574
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:21,790
- We want..
- Justice!

575
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:23,290
- We want..
- Justice!

576
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:24,910
- We want..
- Justice!

577
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,500
- I want..
- Justice!

578
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:28,080
- I want..
- Justice!

579
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,700
- I want..
- Justice!

580
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:32,160
- We want..
- Mr. Saluja, just one question please.

581
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:34,160
- Sir, just question. Please, sir.
- No comments.

582
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:37,000
Couple of months ago
you defended Dhiren Shah..

583
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,290
..who defaulted on billions of rupees.

584
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:40,870
These women are raising their
voice against sexual harassment..

585
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,500
..and you are defending a rapist.

586
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:44,250
Don't you think so you're
defending the villains.

587
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:47,290
The court decides who is a
rapist and who isn't, not the media.

588
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:50,750
Sir, according to a report 90%
of the defenders are actually guilty.

589
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:55,160
Would you like to live in a country
where 90% of the accused are innocent.

590
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:56,700
- I want..
- Justice!

591
00:46:56,830 --> 00:46:58,080
- I want..
- Justice!

592
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,540
- I want..
- Justice!

593
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:01,120
- I want..
- Justice!

594
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:02,750
- We want..
- Justice!

595
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:04,160
- We want..
- Justice!

596
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:05,750
- We want..
- Justice!

597
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,750
- I want..
- Justice!

598
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:09,120
- I want..
- Justice!

599
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:10,790
- I want..
- Justice!

600
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:12,330
- We want..
- Justice!

601
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:13,950
- We want..
- Justice!

602
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:28,950
- I want..
- Justice!

603
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,080
- We want..
- Justice!

604
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:33,620
- We want..
- Justice!

605
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:36,790
- I want..
- Justice!

606
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:42,870
- We want..
- Justice!

607
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,250
- I want..
- Justice!

608
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:50,950
- We want..
- Justice!

609
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:00,620
Your Honours,
defence would like to examine PW2.

610
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,660
Investigating officer, PSI Milind Kasle.

611
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:07,040
Kasle. Witness box.

612
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:14,250
When did you receive information
of the alleged crime?

613
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:16,370
8th July..

614
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:22,500
..when Anjali Vasudev Dangle filed
a rape complaint against the accused.

615
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:28,120
On 8th July, at 1 pm when Anjali
Dangle came down to the Police station.

616
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:30,290
- Correct?
- Yes.

617
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:35,750
And you arrested the accused
on the basis of her statement..

618
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:37,830
..without conducting
any prior investigation.

619
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:39,080
That's the procedure.

620
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:40,950
And, according to the new guidelines..

621
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,080
..any rape accused must
be immediately arrested..

622
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,120
..and taken for
a medical examination.

623
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:46,830
Just to get it straight.

624
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:52,410
You stated that the rape accused
must be immediately arrested..

625
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:55,540
..and taken for a medical examination.

626
00:48:56,370 --> 00:48:59,750
As per procedure,
according to the new guideline.

627
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,120
Yes.

628
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:04,750
Anjali Dangle came down
to your Police Station at 1 pm.

629
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:08,750
But you arrested the accused at 7 pm.

630
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:12,040
What happened to immediate action?

631
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,370
I was recording the
complainant's statement.

632
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:15,500
Fair enough.

633
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:23,040
For the record, the investigating officer
was recording Anjali's statement..

634
00:49:23,450 --> 00:49:25,750
..from 1 pm to 7 pm. Correct.

635
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:27,200
Yes.

636
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:30,120
But normally in sexual
assaults and rape cases..

637
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:32,660
..the statement is
recorded by a lady officer.

638
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:37,500
That's the procedure.
According to the new guidelines.

639
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:44,620
Copy of Anjali Dangle's FIR,
Your Honours.

640
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:49,370
Written and signed
by PSI Monali Indurkar.

641
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,910
The statement was recorded
by a lady officer..

642
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,040
..but I was present
at the Police Station.

643
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,330
What were you doing
at the Police Station?

644
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,200
You were supposed to arrest
the accused as soon as possible.

645
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:08,790
As per the new guidelines.

646
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,660
I was busy with some
administrative work, sir.

647
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:14,950
Meaning when it was time
for you to follow guidelines..

648
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:17,040
..you were busy pushing pencils.

649
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:18,830
Objection, your Honours.

650
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:21,620
Is the investigating
officer on trial here?

651
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:24,370
Is this leading anywhere, Mr. Saluja?

652
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,700
Most certainly, your Honour.

653
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:27,750
Then reach their fast.

654
00:50:30,790 --> 00:50:34,290
You travelled all the way to
the accused's film set to arrest him.

655
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,660
Why not call him up and tell him to
come down to the Police Station instead?

656
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,790
That could have alerted the accused.

657
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:39,950
He could have escaped.

658
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:42,370
For the record, your Honours.

659
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:44,790
The investigating officer..

660
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,910
..did not call Rohan Khurana
so that he doesn't try to escape.

661
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:55,620
This is Rohan Khurana's
certified call detail records.

662
00:50:56,330 --> 00:50:58,500
Whom do these highlighted
landline numbers belong to?

663
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:01,580
Who remembers phone numbers nowadays?

664
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:03,950
Let me rephrase it, you might remember.

665
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:09,290
Did you use this number
to call Rohan Khurana on 8th July?

666
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:13,160
Simple answer, yes or no.

667
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:16,620
No!

668
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:17,830
Take a seat.

669
00:51:18,330 --> 00:51:19,330
But don't leave yet.

670
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
I am not done cross-examining you.

671
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:24,410
Your Honours, the defence would
like to call the accused to the stand.

672
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:29,660
Do you recognise this number?

673
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:33,540
Yes.

674
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:37,910
I received three calls
from this number on 8th July.

675
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:40,950
The CDR confirms that, Your Honours.

676
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:43,450
Who called you?

677
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,410
Sub-Inspector Kasle.

678
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
- Why?
- He wanted a settlement.

679
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,450
What kind of settlement?

680
00:51:49,870 --> 00:51:50,870
He was demanding money..

681
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:53,000
..for not recording the statement.

682
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,370
- And what was the amount?
- Objection!

683
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:56,540
Over-ruled.

684
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:01,580
2 million.

685
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:04,950
And you were willing to pay.

686
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:08,250
No. I asked him for
the complainant's name..

687
00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:10,910
..but he said he cannot
disclose her name.

688
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:14,000
I said to him that whoever she is,
her claims are fake..

689
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,830
..and she is a liar.

690
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:18,330
And I am not ready
for any kind of settlement.

691
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:20,660
In fact, that day I was shooting.

692
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:25,080
I told Inspector Kasle
that I will come down..

693
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,080
..to the Police Station later
that day and talk to her personally.

694
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:31,200
Go on.

695
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:36,450
Then Sub-Inspector Kasle called again.

696
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:42,580
And he said once the
complaint is registered..

697
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,950
..and the victim is presented
before the magistrate..

698
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:48,250
..then no one can save me.

699
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:49,580
And what did you do?

700
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:52,870
I called his superior.

701
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:55,080
I knew him socially.

702
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:57,620
The CDR confirms that too, your Honours.

703
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:00,330
And what did you tell his superior?

704
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:02,290
I explained to him the entire episode..

705
00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:05,830
..and he said he will
look into the matter.

706
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:07,910
Did he?

707
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:09,160
He promised.

708
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,200
And then Kasle called
again for the third time.

709
00:53:12,910 --> 00:53:14,830
What did Kasle say this time?

710
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:16,540
He demanded 5 million.

711
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:23,580
Claiming that the amount will keep
increasing as the case goes higher above.

712
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:29,750
Your Honours, PSI Kasle clearly
knew that under section 166A CRPC..

713
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:33,500
..he's legally bound to
record the rape complainant's FIR.

714
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:40,370
And yet he tried to mislead
my client and extort money..

715
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:43,200
..which Mr. Khurana refused to pay.

716
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:45,160
Objection. How is this relevant?

717
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:47,700
Proves motive for biased investigation,
Your Honours.

718
00:53:47,830 --> 00:53:49,000
Overruled.

719
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:50,750
I object again, Your Honours.

720
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:53,000
Does the defence have
any proof to support his story?

721
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:56,660
Your Honours, the defence would
like to recall PSI Kasle to the stand.

722
00:53:57,870 --> 00:54:01,120
Which Police Manual
gives you the authority..

723
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:04,540
..to seize the mobile phone
of the accused.

724
00:54:06,370 --> 00:54:07,790
No such procedure exists.

725
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,160
Meaning it would be illegal.

726
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:13,370
Correct?

727
00:54:14,290 --> 00:54:19,910
And yet you kept the mobile phone of the
accused for two day in your custody..

728
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,580
..before returning it to his wife.

729
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:23,750
Why?

730
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:33,500
Your Honours, the landline number which
was used to call Mr. Khurana thrice..

731
00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:39,790
..belongs to a cigarette shop right
opposite Mr. Kasle's police station.

732
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:47,330
And here's a certified copy
of the number tracing agency.

733
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:50,330
It is common knowledge, your Honour..

734
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:52,950
..that no Police officer..

735
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:56,160
..will make an extortion
call from his registered mobile..

736
00:54:56,290 --> 00:54:58,160
..or the Police Station's
landline number.

737
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:00,750
They have their own arrangements.

738
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,580
Like PSI Kasle has.

739
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:09,080
He took Rohan's phone in custody..

740
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:13,500
..because he wanted to erase
traces of his conversations with Rohan.

741
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:15,500
According to the charge sheet..

742
00:55:16,330 --> 00:55:18,580
..on the 8th of July, 9 pm..

743
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,080
..you seized this bedsheet..

744
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:25,870
..from Rohan Khurana's
bedroom as evidence. Correct?

745
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,200
Well, if it's mentioned
in the charge sheet..

746
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:29,580
Answer my question.

747
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,790
Did you seize it or did you not?

748
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:34,250
Yes, I did.

749
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:36,700
And this is the same bedsheet..

750
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:40,200
..that contain Rohan
Khurana's semen stains.

751
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:42,790
Am I right?

752
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:45,910
Kasle.

753
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:49,410
Did you even read the
forensic report or not?

754
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:53,080
- I did, your Honour.
- Then answer his question.

755
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:56,700
Yes, that's the same bedsheet.

756
00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:00,540
And this bedsheet is
important in this case..

757
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,830
..because it has Rohan
Khurana's semen stains on it.

758
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,450
Is that not a fact?

759
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:07,370
Yes.

760
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:13,870
Why did you take the
bedsheets in your custody?

761
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:16,500
To send it to the forensic laboratory.

762
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:22,660
You even collected samples of trace
evidence collected from Anjali Dangle..

763
00:56:22,790 --> 00:56:27,080
..during her medical
examination on 8th July.

764
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,040
I did!

765
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:34,910
And the laboratory found Rohan Khurana's
semen traces in those samples as well.

766
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,250
Yes, they did.

767
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:42,000
Obviously, you collected these samples
to send to the forensic, correct.

768
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:43,370
Yes.

769
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:51,000
Then why didn't you send them?

770
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,790
The chain of custody records shows..

771
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:56,950
..that the forensic lab received
these samples on 13th July.

772
00:56:58,750 --> 00:56:59,750
5 days..

773
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:06,370
For 5 days you kept the most crucial
evidence of this case in your custody.

774
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:09,910
With whose permission and why?

775
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:13,870
Why was there a delay?

776
00:57:14,450 --> 00:57:17,540
Kasle, why was there a delay in
sending the samples to the laboratory.

777
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:21,750
VIP Movement.
We were busy with the arrangements.

778
00:57:22,370 --> 00:57:23,580
For 5 days?

779
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,250
There was a VIP movement for 5 days.

780
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:29,160
We need an answer.

781
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:35,000
Not a single officer was available
to deliver the samples to the lab?

782
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:38,000
Your Honours,
the presence of Rohan Khurana's semen..

783
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:40,200
..in the private part
of the prosecutrix..

784
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:42,040
..is the foremost evidence in this case.

785
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,830
- Objection!
- Over-ruled.

786
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:48,950
Your Honours,
the most vital evidence of this case..

787
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:55,580
..was illegally in the custody
of a corrupt and biased Police officer.

788
00:57:56,870 --> 00:57:59,870
The chain of custody
has not just been compromised.

789
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:02,660
It has been blown to smithereens.

790
00:58:03,870 --> 00:58:06,370
PSI Kasle had the opportunity..

791
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:10,790
..to tamper and
contaminate the evidence.

792
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,910
This evidence is tainted.

793
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:18,580
And such tainted evidence cannot
be admissible in any court of Law.

794
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:23,250
And furthermore, without this evidence..

795
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:25,750
..the Prosecution has no case.

796
00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:29,370
I, therefore, appeal to the court..

797
00:58:30,290 --> 00:58:33,000
..for an immediate and honourable
acquittal of my client.

798
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,790
Objection, your Honours!

799
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:44,250
A broken chain of custody
is a matter of grave concern.

800
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:47,330
This court needs some
time to reflect on the issue.

801
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:52,410
This court stands in recess, until 4 pm.

802
00:59:06,870 --> 00:59:09,910
Mr. Kasle, is this how
you conduct an investigation?

803
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:14,330
Your irresponsible behaviour
has ruined my case.

804
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:16,830
Don't worry, madam.
This won't ruin anything.

805
00:59:16,910 --> 00:59:18,080
What do you mean?

806
00:59:19,330 --> 00:59:21,540
Would you say this
if she was your daughter?

807
00:59:21,910 --> 00:59:24,000
You should be thankful
that we recorded her complaint.

808
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,410
Lawyers such as you
can only argue in court..

809
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:28,040
..but we know the ground reality.

810
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
We deal with at least a
dozen cases like this every month.

811
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:33,700
Only to find out later that
they were already living together..

812
00:59:33,830 --> 00:59:35,750
..and the girl came down to file a
complaint because they had a little spat.

813
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:39,790
This attitude is why most
rape cases don't get recorded.

814
00:59:39,870 --> 00:59:42,410
We're used to getting badgered.

815
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:45,250
First the Judge,
then the Defence Lawyer..

816
00:59:45,370 --> 00:59:48,200
- ..and now it's your turn.
- Fine. I'll talk to your superiors.

817
00:59:48,330 --> 00:59:49,200
Thanks

818
00:59:57,870 --> 01:00:01,200
You know that the evidence
wasn't contaminated.

819
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,160
How would you feel winning
this case on technical grounds?

820
01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:07,370
Do you think the truth will prevail?

821
01:00:07,830 --> 01:00:09,160
Do you think Justice will be done?

822
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:10,370
Sit.

823
01:00:12,790 --> 01:00:14,790
- No, thank you.
- Come on.

824
01:00:15,870 --> 01:00:16,700
Sit.

825
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:23,580
You are a Prosecutor.

826
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:27,870
And you straight away believe
that you are defending the truth.

827
01:00:29,450 --> 01:00:32,700
But during the alleged incident,
you weren't present there nor was I.

828
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,370
The truth is Hiral..

829
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:42,500
..our Criminal Legal system
is an adversarial system.

830
01:00:43,870 --> 01:00:46,370
One must lose so the other can win.

831
01:00:47,290 --> 01:00:49,410
And everyone wants to win.

832
01:00:51,370 --> 01:00:54,750
This lentil is the prosecutor.

833
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:59,290
It wants to win for a promotion,
fee hike..

834
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,120
..to become advocate general,
solicitor general

835
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:07,830
The Rice is the defence.

836
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:15,330
He wants to win for the name,
fame, increase in legal fee.

837
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
This is the judge.

838
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:20,750
He wants to win too.

839
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:25,830
To go from Sessions court to High
and then the Supreme Court.

840
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:27,950
And give landmark judges..

841
01:01:28,790 --> 01:01:30,580
..which will be taught in Law colleges.

842
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:37,290
And justice is like this curd..

843
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:46,700
That gets left out in
everyone's race to victory.

844
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:49,870
In our profession..

845
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:55,080
..idealism and ambition
don't last together too long.

846
01:01:57,330 --> 01:01:58,750
It's just that you are new..

847
01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:01,870
..and haven't been tested yet.

848
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:07,870
This is exactly
why I quit your chamber.

849
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:33,750
'With the Rohan Khurana Rape
case is dragging in the High court..'

850
01:02:33,870 --> 01:02:36,620
'..the discontent of the
people are picking up pace.'

851
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:39,370
'Support for the victim
is growing exponentially..'

852
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:41,200
'..across all social media platforms.'

853
01:02:41,370 --> 01:02:44,080
'Groups are being formed,
and hashtags are trending.'

854
01:03:00,790 --> 01:03:02,330
This court is of the opinion..

855
01:03:02,450 --> 01:03:05,370
..that the point raised
by the learned defence council..

856
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:07,410
..are technically valid points..

857
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,290
..which is very unfortunate.

858
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:14,790
But it will be more so if
the prosecutrix is made to suffer..

859
01:03:14,910 --> 01:03:18,620
..for the lack of integrity
of our Law Enforcement Agencies.

860
01:03:20,370 --> 01:03:23,910
This court acknowledges
that PSI Milind Kasle has indeed..

861
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:26,290
..compromised the chain of custody.

862
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:29,160
But this court also believes that..

863
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:33,250
..PSI Milind Kasle does not
have any scientific knowledge..

864
01:03:33,370 --> 01:03:38,750
..or mental acumen to actually
tamper and contaminate the evidences

865
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:41,120
Therefore this court has decided..

866
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:46,000
..to allow all the forensic
and medical evidences against accused.

867
01:03:46,370 --> 01:03:49,370
And sees no reason for the
acquittal of Rohan Ravi Khurana.

868
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:51,700
- Your Honour, I refer..
- Much obliged, Your Honour.

869
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:56,750
Your Honour, I refer to the
State Vs Vikram Rao, 2015 I believe.

870
01:03:57,080 --> 01:04:00,200
Charges were under section 375,
376, among others.

871
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:03,120
The chain of custody
was found to be compromised.

872
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:08,000
And all evidence disallowed resulting
in the acquittal of the accused.

873
01:04:08,330 --> 01:04:11,660
Presiding judge was you, Your Honour.

874
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:14,830
Yes, I am well aware of that,
Mr. Saluja.

875
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:16,700
But all cases are different.

876
01:04:16,830 --> 01:04:21,330
And I don't give
"One size fits all" kind of decisions.

877
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:24,250
Your Honour, if the Honourable
Court is of the opinion..

878
01:04:24,370 --> 01:04:26,700
..that Anjali Dangle
shouldn't be made to suffer..

879
01:04:26,830 --> 01:04:29,330
..due to the Police lack of duty,
then why should my client.

880
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:32,410
I request that he be
granted immediate bail..

881
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:35,250
..till such time that
the court reaches a verdict.

882
01:04:35,450 --> 01:04:36,830
Bail denied.

883
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:39,160
This court is adjourned.

884
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,910
I warned you against this case, Tarun.

885
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:03,450
- It's been a long day.
- Oh my sympathies.

886
01:05:06,330 --> 01:05:12,000
I told Prajakta to call
home and inform I am fine.

887
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:16,200
Your daughter saw you get
humiliated on national television.

888
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:17,580
Is that good?

889
01:05:21,410 --> 01:05:23,120
- Where is she?
- Asleep.

890
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:26,660
Crying all the while and
asking when you're coming home.

891
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:41,540
You saw what happened in the courtroom.

892
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:44,250
That Inspector has implicated me.

893
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:46,330
Do you believe me now?

894
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:48,830
You do.

895
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:52,370
Otherwise you would
have never come here.

896
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:56,330
I came to see the guy I met in college..

897
01:05:56,580 --> 01:05:58,660
..and not the guy you've turned into.

898
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:00,660
Everything will be fine.

899
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:04,500
And when the dust settles down,
let's start a family.

900
01:06:05,790 --> 01:06:06,790
Have a child.

901
01:06:07,410 --> 01:06:11,950
Right now I am thankful
we don't have a child.

902
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:19,330
On the 8th of July,
Savi enters the lift at 11:18.

903
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:22,500
And returns at 11:40.

904
01:06:22,830 --> 01:06:25,330
That's exactly 22 minutes.

905
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:30,120
Your Honours, the defence would
like to examine PW1 Anjali Dangle.

906
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:31,950
Objection, your Honours.

907
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:34,330
Reminiscing a horrific
incident like rape..

908
01:06:34,450 --> 01:06:36,910
..is like putting her
through the same ordeal again.

909
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:38,120
Overruled.

910
01:06:38,580 --> 01:06:40,790
Once she has taken the stand,
Ms. Gandhi..

911
01:06:40,910 --> 01:06:43,200
..the defence has every
right to cross examine.

912
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:51,870
Ms. Dangle, in which part of
the house did the alleged rape occur?

913
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:55,120
Your Honours,
the charge sheet clearly states..

914
01:06:55,250 --> 01:06:56,580
..that the rape occurred in the bedroom.

915
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:59,830
The stained bedsheets was retrieved
from the scene of the crime.

916
01:06:59,950 --> 01:07:01,830
Forensic lab reports confirm..

917
01:07:01,950 --> 01:07:04,950
..that the semen stains on
the bedsheets belonged to the accused.

918
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:07,950
A man's semen on his own bed sheet,
what does that prove?

919
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:10,000
Other than the semen stains..

920
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:11,910
..Anjali Dangle's hair strands
were also found on the bed.

921
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:13,450
Exhibit no. 6.

922
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:18,700
Exhibit no. 7. Mogra flowers
found in the recess of the bed..

923
01:07:18,830 --> 01:07:21,500
..which Anjali Dangle wears on her head.

924
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:24,540
The flowers found on the bed were dry,
Your Honours.

925
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:28,580
Why did you go to Mr. Khurana's
room in the first place?

926
01:07:28,910 --> 01:07:31,290
- He forced me.
- How?

927
01:07:31,410 --> 01:07:34,500
Did he lift you in his arms?
Push you? Drag you? How?

928
01:07:34,620 --> 01:07:36,870
Your Honours,
she has already testified..

929
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,000
..that the accused grabbed
her by her belt and dragged her.

930
01:07:40,410 --> 01:07:42,120
Now may the witness answer,
Your Honours.

931
01:07:42,410 --> 01:07:43,450
Please..

932
01:07:45,410 --> 01:07:49,200
He grabbed me by my belt,
and dragged me to his bedroom.

933
01:07:49,330 --> 01:07:51,410
Why didn't you scream
or raise a commotion?

934
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:52,620
I did scream.

935
01:07:52,750 --> 01:07:57,620
And strangely, your Honours,
the neighbours heard nothing.

936
01:08:02,830 --> 01:08:05,540
You inquired with the neighbours.

937
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:06,450
Yes.

938
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:09,500
Did anyone hear anything?

939
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:12,450
Like a struggle, or a scream.

940
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:14,580
None of the neighbours
gave us such a statement.

941
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:15,540
They are his neighbours after all.

942
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:18,910
Maybe no one gave a statement
to the Police to maintain relationships.

943
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:23,910
But maybe someone heard Anjali Dangle's
scream during the alleged rape..

944
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:26,830
- ..and inform building security?
- No.

945
01:08:26,950 --> 01:08:29,200
Or dial 100.

946
01:08:29,330 --> 01:08:31,750
We got no such intimation from the PCR.

947
01:08:31,870 --> 01:08:33,040
Thank you, Monali.

948
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:35,500
Your witness, Ms. Gandhi.

949
01:08:37,910 --> 01:08:39,080
No cross, your Honours.

950
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:41,370
But I pray to this honourable
court to consider..

951
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:44,830
..that Mumbai is the 10th
noisiest city in the world.

952
01:08:44,950 --> 01:08:46,410
So, unfortunately if no one heard..

953
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:49,080
..Anjali Dangle's screams
among the hustle and bustle..

954
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:52,290
..that doesn't conclude
that she didn't resist at all.

955
01:08:54,910 --> 01:08:56,040
Naive.

956
01:09:02,410 --> 01:09:04,620
Ms. Dangle, please tell this court..

957
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:07,750
..what he did after
dragging you to the bedroom.

958
01:09:07,870 --> 01:09:10,040
Objection. Harassing the victim.

959
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:12,160
Your Honours,
I object to her objections.

960
01:09:12,290 --> 01:09:15,620
She is deliberately trying
to derail the momentum of my cross.

961
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:18,660
If the prosecution asks for details,
then that's not harassment.

962
01:09:18,790 --> 01:09:21,120
But if the defence asks for the same,
then that amounts to harassment.

963
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:23,410
Overruled.

964
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:25,540
Tell us.

965
01:09:26,660 --> 01:09:28,290
Next he took off my jeans.

966
01:09:28,410 --> 01:09:29,750
Stop right there.

967
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:33,620
I would like to show this
pair of jeans to the court.

968
01:09:36,370 --> 01:09:38,040
Prosecution exhibit no. 3.

969
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:40,290
It's the jeans that
Anjali Dangle was wearing..

970
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:42,000
..on the night of the alleged incident.

971
01:09:42,370 --> 01:09:46,910
And the defence has an identical pair.

972
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:50,450
Your Honour, I need your permission
for a short demonstration.

973
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,580
Your Honours, the Prosecution would
first like to compare both the jeans.

974
01:09:55,950 --> 01:09:57,080
By all means.

975
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:23,330
Are you happy, Ms. Gandhi.

976
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:30,000
Proceed, Mr. Saluja.

977
01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:19,500
As The Honourable court can see..

978
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:24,290
It takes time and effort
to wear and take off this jeans.

979
01:11:24,410 --> 01:11:26,870
It is impossible that
a man singlehandedly..

980
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,160
..could rip off a tight-fitting,
body hugging jeans.

981
01:11:30,410 --> 01:11:33,160
Especially when the women is resisting,
Your Honours.

982
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:35,160
The question before us is..

983
01:11:35,410 --> 01:11:41,620
..are 22 minutes enough for Mr. Khurana
to first seduce Anjali Dangle..

984
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:45,330
..for Ms. Dangle to refuse,
resist, scream..

985
01:11:45,450 --> 01:11:47,870
..then Mr. Khurana
drags her to his bedroom..

986
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,620
..rip off her tight-fitting
jeans even though she is resisting.

987
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:54,910
Assault and batter her. Then Rape her.

988
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:59,830
And then for her to wear
that tight fitting jeans again..

989
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:05,540
..climb down 10 floors, walk
through the entire complex and go out.

990
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:10,700
I ask the Honourable Court,
is it all possible in 22 minutes?

991
01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:13,750
Your Honours,
the accused had her pinned down.

992
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,910
She was pinned down by force.

993
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:18,120
Your Honours, it is very well settled..

994
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:20,200
..that in cases of physical assault..

995
01:12:20,620 --> 01:12:24,080
..the fingernail scrapings
are considered conclusive evidence.

996
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:29,160
If Rohan Khurana actually
had Anjali Dangle pinned down..

997
01:12:29,830 --> 01:12:31,580
..then, did the medical examiner..

998
01:12:32,250 --> 01:12:37,330
..find skin of blood traces of Anjali
Dangle under Mr. Khurana's fingernails.

999
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:39,870
Rohan Khurana's medical report,
Your Honours.

1000
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:42,660
The fingernail section is empty.

1001
01:12:48,830 --> 01:12:50,750
Fingernails..

1002
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:52,830
We didn't check it, sir.

1003
01:12:52,950 --> 01:12:53,950
Why?

1004
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:56,120
Why not? Speak up.

1005
01:12:56,450 --> 01:12:58,370
- It slipped my mind.
- Slipped your mind?

1006
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:04,620
Kasle, did you not cross
check the medical report?

1007
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:06,580
It was conclusive evidence.

1008
01:13:08,330 --> 01:13:10,500
Your Honours, Dr. Vasant Tambe..

1009
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:13,040
..the doctor who
examined Anjali Dangle..

1010
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:15,830
..collected scrapings from
under Anjali Dangle's fingernails.

1011
01:13:15,950 --> 01:13:20,700
And the lab found skin and blood
traces of the accused in the scrapings.

1012
01:13:20,830 --> 01:13:25,660
Luckily Dr. Sathe remembered
to take these pictures.

1013
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:31,410
Your Honours,
these pictures tell a different story.

1014
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:34,580
When someone's resisting..

1015
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:38,660
..they try to push him away.

1016
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:42,000
Resistance marks are
normally on the frontal body.

1017
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:45,540
Like chest,
arms, upper face, and not on the back.

1018
01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:52,000
These marks..indicate towards
a passionate sexual encounter.

1019
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:54,580
Wait. Hang on.

1020
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:57,200
Mr. Saluja, are you now
saying that your client..

1021
01:13:57,370 --> 01:14:00,870
..had sexual intercourse with Anjali Dangle
on the 8th of July.

1022
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:02,370
Yes.

1023
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:05,080
And passionate sexual intercourse.

1024
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:09,330
But Your Honours, all this
is not possible within 22 minutes.

1025
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Especially when the woman is resisting.

1026
01:14:13,250 --> 01:14:14,950
The defence admits..

1027
01:14:15,370 --> 01:14:18,910
..that sexual intercourse did in fact
happen between Rohan and Anjali Dangle.

1028
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:23,910
But this happened with Anjali
Dangle's consent and participation.

1029
01:14:24,410 --> 01:14:27,120
The accused and the prosecutrix
were involved in an affair.

1030
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:29,080
And when the affair ended..

1031
01:14:29,410 --> 01:14:33,410
..Anjali Dangle filed a false
and vindictive charge of rape.

1032
01:14:33,620 --> 01:14:38,620
Your Honours, are injuries on the victim's
inner thighs indicative of consent?

1033
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:40,870
She was clearly violated.

1034
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:45,950
We'll hear the matter
further on 24th October.

1035
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:47,500
24th October.

1036
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:57,910
That was nonsense.

1037
01:14:58,790 --> 01:15:01,410
My career was over,
but I still had a family.

1038
01:15:02,450 --> 01:15:03,540
But not any longer.

1039
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,250
I had no choice.

1040
01:15:05,370 --> 01:15:09,040
Yes, but until I was
denying I still had a chance.

1041
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:13,410
The reason you're here
is because you kept denying.

1042
01:15:14,290 --> 01:15:16,950
Do you know what happens
to rape convicts inside jail.

1043
01:15:17,250 --> 01:15:21,330
They have to suffer the same
fate for which they serve time.

1044
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:24,870
Rohan, once you get out of here..

1045
01:15:25,790 --> 01:15:30,120
..you might still have a
chance to a family and a career.

1046
01:15:33,580 --> 01:15:35,870
'As Rohan Khurana's appeal
continues to be heard..'

1047
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,700
'..protests outside the
court premises has intensified.'

1048
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:40,620
'Fearing further
escalation and violence..'

1049
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:43,620
'..the court has asked the
State Police for reinforcements.'

1050
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:54,540
Hello.

1051
01:15:54,660 --> 01:15:57,700
Sir, Anjali Dangle's
neighbour Sujata Kamble..

1052
01:15:57,830 --> 01:16:00,120
..claims to have seen something..

1053
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:01,540
..but she doesn't
want to testify in court.

1054
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:02,870
Please talk to her.

1055
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:07,080
Hello.

1056
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:08,620
Hello, sir.

1057
01:16:08,790 --> 01:16:10,160
Tell me what you saw.

1058
01:16:10,450 --> 01:16:13,290
That morning I was putting
clothes out to dry..

1059
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:15,410
..when Anjali was leaving for shoot.

1060
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:17,450
And she seemed perfectly well.

1061
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:20,290
But when she got down from
the rickshaw in the afternoon..

1062
01:16:30,450 --> 01:16:31,700
I see.

1063
01:16:35,450 --> 01:16:37,290
Thank you, Sujata. Thank you.

1064
01:16:39,870 --> 01:16:43,700
Your Honours, the defence would
like to examine PW6, Pramod Dangle.

1065
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:51,950
Pramod, you look like a decent guy.

1066
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:56,370
I don't think you know much
about the Law, so let me warn you..

1067
01:16:57,790 --> 01:17:01,500
..false testimony
or lying to the court..

1068
01:17:02,750 --> 01:17:05,000
..could lead to 7-years of imprisonment.

1069
01:17:08,370 --> 01:17:10,000
I see you are wearing a pearl.

1070
01:17:11,370 --> 01:17:12,750
Do you feel any different?

1071
01:17:13,790 --> 01:17:15,830
How is this relevant
to my sister's case?

1072
01:17:15,950 --> 01:17:19,410
Pearls are worn for controlling ones temper.

1073
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:21,910
So I asked.

1074
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:26,910
Your temper has everything
to do with your sister's case.

1075
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:31,750
On the 8th of July, when your
sister returned home and told you..

1076
01:17:31,870 --> 01:17:37,200
..that this man has committed
a heinous act of rape with her..

1077
01:17:37,330 --> 01:17:39,540
..then you must have lost your temper.

1078
01:17:40,580 --> 01:17:41,870
Didn't you?

1079
01:17:42,370 --> 01:17:43,660
Your younger sister..

1080
01:17:43,790 --> 01:17:46,000
I did, sir. I did lose my temper.

1081
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:47,910
I wanted to break his legs.

1082
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:49,700
Then what stopped you?

1083
01:17:50,370 --> 01:17:51,790
- Were you scared?
- No.

1084
01:17:51,910 --> 01:17:53,290
My mom and dad stopped me.

1085
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:55,620
Your mom and dad stopped you

1086
01:17:55,870 --> 01:17:58,950
But what about your anger?

1087
01:18:00,580 --> 01:18:01,700
Let me tell you..

1088
01:18:02,950 --> 01:18:05,620
You vented it on your sister.

1089
01:18:07,660 --> 01:18:12,410
You dragged her inside the
house and started beating her.

1090
01:18:13,870 --> 01:18:16,750
Because you thought
it was equally her fault.

1091
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:20,290
Why did she go to his house all alone?

1092
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:22,200
She should have thought about it.

1093
01:18:23,410 --> 01:18:26,330
Because the pride and honour of the
family rests on shoulders of the female.

1094
01:18:27,870 --> 01:18:30,000
Doesn't matter if the male commits rape.

1095
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:33,620
But if a female returns
home after getting raped..

1096
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:36,870
..then the people around
you never let you forget.

1097
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,910
Look..that's rape victim
Anjali Dangle's brother.

1098
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:46,290
Look..that's her father.

1099
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:50,160
That's her mother.

1100
01:18:51,870 --> 01:18:56,000
I can understand
how humiliated you felt.

1101
01:18:56,080 --> 01:19:01,120
And you vented your frustration
on your sister and battered her.

1102
01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:04,910
The punishment for lying
is 7 years of imprisonment.

1103
01:19:05,660 --> 01:19:10,000
And I have six witnesses
who saw you assaulting your sister.

1104
01:19:10,580 --> 01:19:11,870
Do you want me to call them?

1105
01:19:12,290 --> 01:19:15,120
Do you want to end up..in jail?

1106
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:18,120
Because I can make it happen.

1107
01:19:18,790 --> 01:19:24,620
And anyway,
a brother like you is no good to any..

1108
01:19:24,750 --> 01:19:26,040
Yes, I did beat her. So what?

1109
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:27,330
It was her fault too.

1110
01:19:40,330 --> 01:19:41,370
How did you hit her?

1111
01:19:49,790 --> 01:19:51,080
With your hands?

1112
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:56,000
And where?

1113
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:57,750
- Objection.
- Overruled.

1114
01:19:57,910 --> 01:19:59,950
- I want to hear him.
- On the face?

1115
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,660
- Yes.
- And..

1116
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:10,910
Here..and on her back.

1117
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:12,700
Thank you very much.

1118
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:14,200
You may proceed.

1119
01:20:21,660 --> 01:20:25,160
Your Honour, defence would
like to reexamine Anjali Dangle.

1120
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:32,620
Ms. Dangle, you clearly remember
every detail of the alleged incident.

1121
01:20:33,540 --> 01:20:35,120
Then while recording your statement..

1122
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:38,950
..why did you leave out the fact
that your own brother assaulted you?

1123
01:20:43,580 --> 01:20:47,830
Your Honours, the prosecutrix
has falsely testified to the Police..

1124
01:20:47,950 --> 01:20:50,160
..and has blatantly lied
to this Honourable court.

1125
01:20:50,660 --> 01:20:52,870
I was first assaulted
by sir and then my brother.

1126
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:58,160
How could I distinguish between
the two at that moment?

1127
01:21:04,250 --> 01:21:09,250
And you thought I've already
falsely accused him of rape..

1128
01:21:09,950 --> 01:21:12,330
..let's blame him for
physical assault as well.

1129
01:21:12,450 --> 01:21:13,330
Objection.

1130
01:21:13,450 --> 01:21:16,450
The defence council
is conveniently ignoring..

1131
01:21:16,540 --> 01:21:19,120
..the marks on Anjali
Dangle's inner thighs..

1132
01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:21,700
..which could have never
been infected by her brother.

1133
01:21:21,830 --> 01:21:27,410
Your Honours, I am only talking
about the facial and body bruise.

1134
01:21:27,540 --> 01:21:30,000
They were not inflicted by my client.

1135
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:32,160
And the relevant
charges must be dropped.

1136
01:21:32,330 --> 01:21:33,450
Sir, please.

1137
01:21:33,870 --> 01:21:36,700
Do elaborate about the
injuries on the inner thighs.

1138
01:21:36,830 --> 01:21:38,000
What about them?

1139
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:39,540
What do you mean what about them?

1140
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:42,700
Yes, they are not signs of assault.

1141
01:21:42,790 --> 01:21:46,080
Sir, they are clearly indicative
of forced and violent entry.

1142
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:47,370
No, they are not.

1143
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:48,580
Then what are they?

1144
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:51,580
They could be marks of aggressive sex.

1145
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:53,450
- Aggressive..
- Oh, yes.

1146
01:21:53,950 --> 01:21:55,790
Couples can be very creative these days.

1147
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:56,830
Enough.

1148
01:21:57,580 --> 01:21:58,950
You two come to my chamber.

1149
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:05,120
Behave.

1150
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:09,000
Otherwise I will hold
both of you in contempt.

1151
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:12,500
Your Honours, the girl's
testimony simply cannot be trusted.

1152
01:22:12,910 --> 01:22:16,000
Your Honours, my client
reiterated her exact statement..

1153
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:17,410
..that she gave to the Police.

1154
01:22:17,580 --> 01:22:20,290
She withheld important information.

1155
01:22:20,410 --> 01:22:21,660
On my council.

1156
01:22:21,790 --> 01:22:23,250
I take full responsibility.

1157
01:22:23,370 --> 01:22:25,410
You advised her to withhold information?

1158
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:28,290
So Mr. Saluja cannot
use a minor inconsistency..

1159
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:30,200
Minor inconsistency!

1160
01:22:30,370 --> 01:22:34,910
..use it to bend the
facts and prove her wrong.

1161
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:37,250
Just imagine, a female gets raped..

1162
01:22:37,370 --> 01:22:39,910
..she comes home,
gets assaulted by her brother.

1163
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:42,040
And the benefit goes to her rapist.

1164
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:45,250
But that doesn't mean
that facts can be withheld.

1165
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:49,950
You can file a complaint against her,
I can take action.

1166
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:53,250
Your Honour,
how does that benefit my client.

1167
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:56,500
Take the charges of physical assault
off and the defence will be happy.

1168
01:22:56,580 --> 01:23:01,040
Tarun, this is not a flea market
where you can bargain on charges.

1169
01:23:02,750 --> 01:23:06,160
Your Honours, how can the
physical assault charges be dropped?

1170
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:08,080
There is still the
matter of injury marks..

1171
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,750
..on the inner thighs
of the Prosecutrix.

1172
01:23:09,910 --> 01:23:12,200
- Let the court decide that, Ms. Gandhi.
- Sorry.

1173
01:23:12,290 --> 01:23:13,790
This is your first high profile case..

1174
01:23:13,910 --> 01:23:16,700
..which is why Justice Madgaonkar
and I are not taking any action.

1175
01:23:16,830 --> 01:23:19,500
But please make sure
that in the next hearing..

1176
01:23:19,950 --> 01:23:23,370
..there are absolutely no
inconsistencies in her testimony.

1177
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:26,160
Thank you, Your Honours. Much obliged.

1178
01:23:28,830 --> 01:23:30,750
Meera Singh believes..

1179
01:23:31,250 --> 01:23:35,120
..that Rohan Khurana sexually
molested you inside the van.

1180
01:23:40,290 --> 01:23:41,450
Is that a fact?

1181
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:44,000
Yes.

1182
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:46,950
And this physical contact
happened without your consent?

1183
01:23:47,250 --> 01:23:49,120
- No.
- Then I am sure..

1184
01:23:50,450 --> 01:23:53,750
..that you must have complained
to someone after coming out of the van.

1185
01:23:54,370 --> 01:23:55,250
No?

1186
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:59,160
Meera Singh. Natasha Malhotra,
Producer Jasbeer Walia..

1187
01:23:59,250 --> 01:24:03,040
Your Honours, in such cases
even if the female complains..

1188
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:04,750
..then she is deemed the trouble maker.

1189
01:24:04,910 --> 01:24:06,200
She would have lost her job.

1190
01:24:06,290 --> 01:24:08,870
No one will fire the
director on the basis of..

1191
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,250
..a junior costume
assistant's complaint.

1192
01:24:10,370 --> 01:24:12,910
Not only did she not complain,
Your Honours.

1193
01:24:14,450 --> 01:24:15,830
After everything that happened..

1194
01:24:15,950 --> 01:24:18,120
..you went back to Rohan Khurana's home.

1195
01:24:18,290 --> 01:24:19,290
That also alone?

1196
01:24:19,580 --> 01:24:20,410
Why?

1197
01:24:20,910 --> 01:24:21,910
That was my job.

1198
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:25,830
Even after Mr. Khurana's house-help
Savi left you decided to stay.

1199
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:28,120
Is that also part of your job?

1200
01:24:30,870 --> 01:24:32,910
So clear, Your Honour, So clear.

1201
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:35,160
They were having an affair.

1202
01:24:35,580 --> 01:24:39,500
And whatever happened in the van,
happened with the consent of Ms. Dangle.

1203
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:43,160
Your Honours,
the only thing that's clear here..

1204
01:24:43,290 --> 01:24:45,500
..is the inconsistency of this Defence.

1205
01:24:45,660 --> 01:24:47,660
In the beginning he claimed
that sex never happened.

1206
01:24:47,790 --> 01:24:50,040
Then he said they had sex,
but it was consensual.

1207
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:54,160
He deemed every injury
mark as act of passion.

1208
01:24:54,290 --> 01:24:56,290
If you keep repeating
something over and over again..

1209
01:24:56,410 --> 01:24:57,660
..it won't become true.

1210
01:24:57,790 --> 01:24:58,950
Where is the proof?

1211
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:00,120
Here.

1212
01:25:00,700 --> 01:25:03,080
CCTV footage from Mr. Khurana's van.

1213
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:05,160
We'll find proof in here.

1214
01:25:05,290 --> 01:25:09,080
Objection. The prosecution was
not informed about this new evidence..

1215
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:12,040
..and as such it must be made
inadmissible in this court.

1216
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:13,950
Your Honour,
the Defence himself found out..

1217
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:16,160
..about this hard drive
couple of hours ago.

1218
01:25:16,290 --> 01:25:18,200
This is your client's hard drive..

1219
01:25:18,330 --> 01:25:20,830
..and you claim to have
just found out about it.

1220
01:25:20,950 --> 01:25:22,500
Your Honours, my client didn't want..

1221
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:24,200
..to display this footage
in front of his wife..

1222
01:25:24,290 --> 01:25:26,200
..but Mrs. Gandhi has left me no choice.

1223
01:25:26,290 --> 01:25:28,870
It clears a vital point. I will allow it.

1224
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,200
- Please reconsider.
- Overruled.

1225
01:25:34,330 --> 01:25:37,950
Ms. Dangle,
I am going to play this hard drive now.

1226
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:41,080
It is not my intention
to embarrass you at all.

1227
01:25:41,290 --> 01:25:44,160
But this is evidence,
and I must show it to the court.

1228
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:45,660
I am sorry.

1229
01:26:19,910 --> 01:26:21,160
Wait.

1230
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:23,750
What happened?

1231
01:26:24,250 --> 01:26:25,250
You don't want me to play it?

1232
01:26:27,660 --> 01:26:32,290
So you were in physical contact
with Mr. Khurana consensually.

1233
01:26:32,410 --> 01:26:34,700
Objection, pressurising the victim.

1234
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:38,250
Your Honours,
she stopped me from playing the footage.

1235
01:26:38,790 --> 01:26:40,330
It is obvious that she
wants to hide something.

1236
01:26:40,450 --> 01:26:42,200
Your Honours, would any woman want..

1237
01:26:42,330 --> 01:26:44,330
..the world to
see her getting molested.

1238
01:26:44,410 --> 01:26:47,410
Being molested,
or in a consensual act of sex?

1239
01:26:47,540 --> 01:26:50,790
Mr. Saluja, play the hard
drive and get it over with.

1240
01:26:50,910 --> 01:26:52,450
There is no need now, Your Honours.

1241
01:26:52,580 --> 01:26:54,410
The defence has proved its point.

1242
01:26:55,250 --> 01:26:58,500
Your Honours, there is no
CCTV footage on this hard drive.

1243
01:26:58,660 --> 01:27:00,200
This is my personal hard drive.

1244
01:27:00,950 --> 01:27:03,080
False evidence has been presented.

1245
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:05,620
It invokes section 193.

1246
01:27:05,790 --> 01:27:07,160
Mr. Saluja, in this court..

1247
01:27:07,250 --> 01:27:10,250
..one expects Lawyers to
keep their punches above the belt.

1248
01:27:10,330 --> 01:27:12,540
I do not think there were
any punches below the belt.

1249
01:27:12,700 --> 01:27:14,870
Then we have different
ideas of the level..

1250
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,870
..at which one practices the Law.

1251
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:20,040
Your Honours, she testified one
way believing there was no hard drive.

1252
01:27:20,290 --> 01:27:24,000
Then believing that it existed,
she stopped me from playing it.

1253
01:27:24,450 --> 01:27:27,620
I do not understand how anything
but the truth has been searched out.

1254
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:30,410
Are you of the view then, Mr. Saluja..

1255
01:27:30,540 --> 01:27:34,370
..that you can demoralise,
confuse, intimidate the witness..

1256
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:36,660
..claiming to be in
possession of some evidence..

1257
01:27:36,790 --> 01:27:39,910
.that you aren't in possession of,
in fact never existed?

1258
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:43,080
When you say never existed ma'am,
do you mean made up?

1259
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:44,580
- Yes.
- No your honour.

1260
01:27:44,750 --> 01:27:47,750
The defence believes that the
implied events did occur in the van..

1261
01:27:47,870 --> 01:27:49,290
..even if there is no recording of it.

1262
01:27:49,410 --> 01:27:52,660
Yet you find it acceptable
indicating by your actions..

1263
01:27:52,790 --> 01:27:55,790
..and mannerisms that
you did have such a recording.

1264
01:27:55,870 --> 01:27:59,870
I regard it as simply an interrogation tool in the pursuit of justice.

1265
01:27:59,950 --> 01:28:03,830
The Law is very strict regarding
your idea of Justice, Mr. Saluja.

1266
01:28:03,950 --> 01:28:05,870
Your Honours,
if you just explain to me..

1267
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,200
I am not here to explain to you.

1268
01:28:08,330 --> 01:28:12,790
And post this trial, your licence
stands suspended for six months.

1269
01:28:15,910 --> 01:28:18,660
Bit harsh,
your honour, but if that's your wish..

1270
01:28:23,870 --> 01:28:27,910
Ms. Dangle, did you go to Rohan
Khurana's house on 4th of July as well?

1271
01:28:28,250 --> 01:28:29,250
Yes.

1272
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:33,200
And did you take the lift
on the 4th of July as well..

1273
01:28:33,330 --> 01:28:35,040
..like on the 8th of July.

1274
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:38,500
It's in your statement,
so I am just confirming.

1275
01:28:39,750 --> 01:28:40,790
Yes.

1276
01:28:42,790 --> 01:28:46,290
This footage is from 8th July,
on the day of the alleged rape.

1277
01:28:46,410 --> 01:28:47,870
Your Honour, we can clearly see..

1278
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,910
..on the 8th of July
Anjali did not tie her hair.

1279
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:56,120
But on the 4th of July,
Anjali was wearing Mogra flowers.

1280
01:28:56,250 --> 01:28:58,700
Your honours,
I had mentioned earlier to the court..

1281
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:02,450
..the flowers found on
Rohan Khurana's bed were dry.

1282
01:29:03,830 --> 01:29:05,000
Women!

1283
01:29:06,410 --> 01:29:09,000
Always wear fresh flowers,
and not dried.

1284
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:11,080
And so it logically follows..

1285
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:14,160
..that the flowers
found on 8th of July..

1286
01:29:14,410 --> 01:29:16,870
..were there from 4th of July.

1287
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,410
Your Honours,
in my entire legal career..

1288
01:29:20,540 --> 01:29:23,040
..the inference has
never been so obvious..

1289
01:29:23,660 --> 01:29:27,500
..that Anjali Dangle was in Rohan
Khurana's bed on 4th of July as well.

1290
01:29:27,620 --> 01:29:29,830
And she goes back on 8th July,
and I can go on and on..

1291
01:29:29,950 --> 01:29:33,160
Because she was not expecting
to be raped, Your Honours.

1292
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:36,120
Your Honours,
I concede the floor to Ms. Gandhi.

1293
01:29:36,370 --> 01:29:37,370
Thank you.

1294
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:38,870
Ms. Gandhi, please continue.

1295
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,450
As per the defence's theory..

1296
01:29:40,580 --> 01:29:44,250
..even if Rohan Khurana and
Anjali Dangle were having an affair..

1297
01:29:44,700 --> 01:29:47,120
..then too the rape charges are valid.

1298
01:29:47,410 --> 01:29:51,160
Going to a man's house
doesn't imply permission to sex.

1299
01:29:51,250 --> 01:29:54,040
Lying on the same bed as the man..

1300
01:29:54,250 --> 01:29:56,160
..doesn't mean permission given for sex.

1301
01:29:56,250 --> 01:30:00,450
Even sex does not imply
permission for future sex.

1302
01:30:00,580 --> 01:30:03,750
According to section 375 of IPC..

1303
01:30:03,870 --> 01:30:07,370
..consent and permission, both are necessary every time.

1304
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:08,540
Agreed.

1305
01:30:08,870 --> 01:30:12,200
But sex is a very private matter.

1306
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:16,040
There are no cameras,
or witnesses in bedrooms.

1307
01:30:16,290 --> 01:30:17,750
How will we know..

1308
01:30:18,250 --> 01:30:22,080
..whether it was consensual on 4th July,
and not on the 8th.

1309
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:24,910
Injury marks on the inner
thighs of the prosecutrix..

1310
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:28,200
..indicate that there
was no consent on 8th of July.

1311
01:30:30,540 --> 01:30:31,950
We'll take further date

1312
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:33,830
- 9th November.
- Okay.

1313
01:30:35,250 --> 01:30:38,830
We'll hear the matter
further on 9th of November.

1314
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:40,330
The court is adjourned.

1315
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:46,620
As the Rohan Khurana hearing enters it's fourth week..

1316
01:30:46,750 --> 01:30:49,620
..the protests against
him show no sign of abating

1317
01:30:50,540 --> 01:30:52,540
We want justice.

1318
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,830
We want justice.

1319
01:31:42,450 --> 01:31:43,870
Photographs, your Honours.

1320
01:31:44,750 --> 01:31:46,200
Of the building's lobby.

1321
01:31:47,250 --> 01:31:49,330
The staircase is on
the left side of the Lobby..

1322
01:31:49,450 --> 01:31:51,540
..and the lift is on the right.

1323
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:57,160
Anjali Dangle enters the lobby
from the left, meaning the staircase.

1324
01:31:57,660 --> 01:31:59,450
But in her statement, she mentioned..

1325
01:31:59,790 --> 01:32:02,620
..that she used the
lift on the 8th of July.

1326
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:04,500
Why did she lie?

1327
01:32:06,830 --> 01:32:09,200
But before I go any further.

1328
01:32:09,580 --> 01:32:13,410
Mr. Khurana wants to give
his confession to the court.

1329
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:40,330
The court is listening.

1330
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:51,870
I met Anjali Dangle six months ago.

1331
01:32:52,540 --> 01:32:55,200
She was the junior costume
assistant on my set.

1332
01:32:55,830 --> 01:32:57,660
I didn't notice her at first.

1333
01:32:57,790 --> 01:33:00,290
But then one day..

1334
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:03,700
Just a second.

1335
01:33:04,870 --> 01:33:07,250
Excuse me. Come here.

1336
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:08,660
Read this.

1337
01:33:10,040 --> 01:33:11,450
Can you read English?

1338
01:33:12,450 --> 01:33:14,200
- Yes, sir.
- What's written here?

1339
01:33:15,410 --> 01:33:16,750
Photographs are prohibited.

1340
01:33:16,870 --> 01:33:19,200
Show me your phone.
Come on, show me your phone.

1341
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:21,040
Show me..

1342
01:33:31,330 --> 01:33:33,660
Don't take my picture
without my permission.

1343
01:33:35,700 --> 01:33:36,830
Get back to work.

1344
01:33:40,330 --> 01:33:42,540
A few days later I
returned late from a party.

1345
01:33:43,290 --> 01:33:44,870
I went straight on the set.

1346
01:33:45,410 --> 01:33:47,120
I think it was about 4 in the morning.

1347
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:49,700
Good morning, sir.

1348
01:34:00,870 --> 01:34:02,660
Tell Spot to send some coffee to my van.

1349
01:34:04,410 --> 01:34:05,750
Yes, sir.

1350
01:34:06,870 --> 01:34:09,370
After that, she came inside my van.

1351
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:12,540
- Spot boys weren't available?
- No one's turned up yet.

1352
01:34:13,910 --> 01:34:15,120
Did you make it?

1353
01:34:19,910 --> 01:34:20,950
Steady.

1354
01:34:36,580 --> 01:34:39,200
You want to make coffee for me,
take my pictures.

1355
01:34:42,040 --> 01:34:43,540
But you won't kiss me.

1356
01:34:45,950 --> 01:34:47,790
Sir, I didn't know you were married.

1357
01:34:51,790 --> 01:34:52,790
Open that drawer.

1358
01:34:55,160 --> 01:34:56,500
There's a script inside.

1359
01:35:00,580 --> 01:35:03,330
Prepare a detailed costume presentation.

1360
01:35:05,250 --> 01:35:06,330
I mean it.

1361
01:35:08,830 --> 01:35:09,750
Looks great.

1362
01:35:10,450 --> 01:35:11,450
Kirti..

1363
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,500
Meet Anjali,
costume designer for my next film.

1364
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:17,620
Wow Anjali, that's great. Congratulations.

1365
01:35:17,790 --> 01:35:19,160
Thank you, ma'am.

1366
01:35:24,910 --> 01:35:26,200
Congratulations.

1367
01:35:27,080 --> 01:35:28,250
Thank you, sir.

1368
01:35:36,250 --> 01:35:37,790
No need to waste your time here anymore.

1369
01:35:38,750 --> 01:35:39,660
Only the right contacts can get you work..

1370
01:35:39,790 --> 01:35:41,450
..and it takes years
to make the right contacts.

1371
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,410
Go and meet people..

1372
01:35:44,450 --> 01:35:46,290
Do you know anyone in the Industry?

1373
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:50,080
I know you.

1374
01:35:50,290 --> 01:35:51,910
But how can I help you?

1375
01:35:54,250 --> 01:35:55,620
I am married.

1376
01:35:58,080 --> 01:35:59,620
What do you know about marriages?

1377
01:36:02,250 --> 01:36:05,410
There is a difference between living
together and living under the same roof.

1378
01:36:14,330 --> 01:36:16,120
And that's how it all started.

1379
01:36:18,410 --> 01:36:19,410
Have a look.

1380
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:22,250
I told her never call me without reason.

1381
01:36:23,290 --> 01:36:25,290
We started meeting
in my other apartment.

1382
01:36:26,250 --> 01:36:28,250
And that I think was my biggest mistake.

1383
01:36:29,120 --> 01:36:31,160
Anjali started getting
possessive about me.

1384
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
She got very possessive.

1385
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:37,620
Why do you two still live together?

1386
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:39,160
What?

1387
01:36:40,370 --> 01:36:45,660
You said that you and your wife live
under the same roof, but not together.

1388
01:36:46,410 --> 01:36:48,910
Do you expect me to leave
her and fall in your lap?

1389
01:36:49,870 --> 01:36:51,250
You already are.

1390
01:36:55,330 --> 01:36:56,750
Please wait tonight.

1391
01:36:57,370 --> 01:36:58,700
I have an important meeting.

1392
01:36:58,910 --> 01:37:00,830
Have I ever asked you to stay before?

1393
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:02,450
The phone is ringing,
just give it to me.

1394
01:37:08,950 --> 01:37:12,120
Hey, what are you doing?

1395
01:37:13,250 --> 01:37:14,250
What's going on?

1396
01:37:15,250 --> 01:37:16,620
Just give me my damn phone.

1397
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:19,080
Give it back. Are you mad?

1398
01:37:20,250 --> 01:37:21,410
Give it to me.

1399
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:27,700
Hello. Yeah, I am on my way.

1400
01:37:28,160 --> 01:37:29,080
Yeah!

1401
01:37:32,290 --> 01:37:34,410
You will need this where you're going.

1402
01:37:40,660 --> 01:37:42,370
Happy Anniversary, sir.

1403
01:37:51,370 --> 01:37:53,200
How did you know it was
my Anniversary yesterday?

1404
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,250
Sir, please select from this..

1405
01:37:56,370 --> 01:37:57,750
I am asking you a question.

1406
01:37:59,250 --> 01:38:00,410
How did you know?

1407
01:38:00,660 --> 01:38:02,250
- It is paining, sir.
- How did you know?

1408
01:38:04,330 --> 01:38:07,120
When was the last time you
checked your wife's Facebook page?

1409
01:38:10,950 --> 01:38:12,620
Are you stalking her online?

1410
01:38:13,250 --> 01:38:16,250
No, sir. She is my Facebook friend.

1411
01:38:16,450 --> 01:38:18,790
She posted about her Anniversary,
and every one replied.

1412
01:38:19,580 --> 01:38:20,660
So did I?

1413
01:38:22,660 --> 01:38:23,870
Return the apartment key.

1414
01:38:25,370 --> 01:38:26,790
Give me the damn keys!

1415
01:38:27,080 --> 01:38:28,080
Give it to me.

1416
01:38:34,910 --> 01:38:36,500
You will get your stuff back.

1417
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:38,040
Out!

1418
01:38:39,580 --> 01:38:40,790
Get out!

1419
01:39:05,160 --> 01:39:06,450
Are you sure you want me to leave?

1420
01:39:06,910 --> 01:39:09,700
Close the door properly.
You always leave it ajar.

1421
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:13,290
Of course, Mr. Director.

1422
01:39:14,290 --> 01:39:16,290
Big freakin director.

1423
01:39:27,370 --> 01:39:29,250
And she is back.

1424
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:34,660
What are you doing here?

1425
01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:38,700
Just checking what's
the new flavour of the month.

1426
01:39:39,370 --> 01:39:40,620
I met her outside.

1427
01:39:41,250 --> 01:39:42,620
She won't last too long.

1428
01:39:50,660 --> 01:39:54,450
I design costumes for actors,
and not call girls..

1429
01:39:54,830 --> 01:39:56,540
..who readily sleep
with anyone for work.

1430
01:39:58,250 --> 01:40:00,290
You slept with me too,
so what does that make you?

1431
01:40:04,250 --> 01:40:05,870
It wasn't for work.

1432
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:06,910
I see.

1433
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:13,160
Did you really think I offered
you that job because of your talent?

1434
01:40:13,330 --> 01:40:14,330
Yes.

1435
01:40:14,910 --> 01:40:15,830
Yes!

1436
01:40:17,080 --> 01:40:19,700
These misconceptions
are what I don't like.

1437
01:40:20,250 --> 01:40:21,250
You want to go.

1438
01:40:22,290 --> 01:40:23,370
You go!

1439
01:40:24,330 --> 01:40:25,330
You go!

1440
01:40:26,370 --> 01:40:29,790
There are more than a dozen girls out
there who are more talented than you are.

1441
01:40:30,370 --> 01:40:32,000
No one gets it this easy.

1442
01:40:35,410 --> 01:40:36,950
I did you a favour.

1443
01:40:37,120 --> 01:40:38,370
Look how far I got you.

1444
01:40:38,660 --> 01:40:41,200
But you want to be my wife instead.

1445
01:40:41,660 --> 01:40:42,830
Look at me.

1446
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:46,500
I let you lie next to me,
now don't try to control me.

1447
01:40:46,910 --> 01:40:49,290
Come back once you get over this.

1448
01:40:49,410 --> 01:40:52,000
- I spit on this kind of job.
- Get lost.

1449
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:57,660
Go back to your shit hole.

1450
01:41:02,250 --> 01:41:06,870
I was surprised a few days later, on the
8th of July, she called me to apologise.

1451
01:41:08,750 --> 01:41:10,330
- Yeah.
- Hello, sir.

1452
01:41:10,790 --> 01:41:13,450
Can I talk to you for a minute?

1453
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:17,200
I am very sorry for that arguing..

1454
01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:19,620
You are doing me a favour.

1455
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:21,540
You are shaping my career.

1456
01:41:23,950 --> 01:41:25,660
I don't want anything else.

1457
01:41:26,450 --> 01:41:28,450
But I miss you a lot.

1458
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:31,790
That's all I wanted to say.

1459
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:33,870
Ask Meera whether
the costumes are ready.

1460
01:41:35,370 --> 01:41:36,370
Come over to show them.

1461
01:41:39,700 --> 01:41:41,080
Is Rohan sir at home?

1462
01:41:42,080 --> 01:41:43,160
Meera ma'am sent me over..

1463
01:41:43,330 --> 01:41:45,120
..to show you the costumes
for the shoot on the day after.

1464
01:41:45,410 --> 01:41:46,250
Sit.

1465
01:41:46,540 --> 01:41:47,540
Sit here.

1466
01:41:56,450 --> 01:41:58,250
- Savi!
- Yes.

1467
01:41:58,750 --> 01:42:00,750
There is money and a list on the table.
Get everything from the market.

1468
01:42:15,750 --> 01:42:18,120
Sir, here's the black jacket.

1469
01:42:18,950 --> 01:42:20,330
I asked for see-through.

1470
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:22,410
But this is see-through.

1471
01:42:24,040 --> 01:42:25,160
Wear it and show me.

1472
01:43:03,700 --> 01:43:06,250
Your Honours,
Rohan Khurana is not a nice man.

1473
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:12,080
Was it right what Rohan
Khurana did with Anjali Dangle?

1474
01:43:12,500 --> 01:43:13,410
No.

1475
01:43:13,540 --> 01:43:18,540
A backward class girl, one who had
accorded him to the status of a God..

1476
01:43:18,830 --> 01:43:22,290
..encouraged her, that there's
something special about her..

1477
01:43:22,370 --> 01:43:25,790
..showed her dreams of success..

1478
01:43:26,540 --> 01:43:29,910
..and then snatched everything from her.

1479
01:43:30,830 --> 01:43:34,750
This crime is nothing short of rape.

1480
01:43:36,540 --> 01:43:38,660
But your Honours, it's not rape.

1481
01:43:39,540 --> 01:43:44,540
Your Honours, why did Ms. Dangle
use the staircase on 8th July?

1482
01:43:46,750 --> 01:43:52,540
Because there's not a single
CCTV camera installed there.

1483
01:43:54,660 --> 01:43:59,660
What actually happened on 8th July was..

1484
01:45:30,120 --> 01:45:32,750
That is the relevance of the staircase,
your Honours.

1485
01:45:33,080 --> 01:45:39,330
Mr. Rohan Ravi Khurana never violated
the body of Ms. Anjali Vasudev Dangle.

1486
01:45:39,950 --> 01:45:44,000
He violated her mind,
her spirit, her very dignity.

1487
01:45:45,500 --> 01:45:46,660
This case..

1488
01:45:46,830 --> 01:45:51,450
This case is not about Ms. Dangle's rape,
it is about her revenge.

1489
01:45:54,750 --> 01:45:56,450
The defence rests, your Honours.

1490
01:46:01,450 --> 01:46:03,290
Closing statement, Ms. Gandhi.

1491
01:46:06,950 --> 01:46:10,950
Your Honours,
Indian Penal Code clearly states..

1492
01:46:11,080 --> 01:46:14,580
..that if a man holds a
position of power over a woman..

1493
01:46:14,870 --> 01:46:18,700
..and if the sexual act between
them has been medically proved..

1494
01:46:18,830 --> 01:46:24,250
..and if woman admits in court that the
act was against her will or permission.

1495
01:46:24,330 --> 01:46:27,200
Then the burden of
proof falls on the accused.

1496
01:46:27,620 --> 01:46:29,500
One needs evidence for proof.

1497
01:46:29,830 --> 01:46:32,750
The defence council
has cooked up many stories..

1498
01:46:32,830 --> 01:46:35,330
..but no evidence to corroborate them.

1499
01:46:35,870 --> 01:46:39,450
The first story,
investigating officer Milind Kasle.

1500
01:46:39,540 --> 01:46:42,950
The second story,
Rape isn't possible within 22 minutes.

1501
01:46:43,540 --> 01:46:45,080
Ask the victim.

1502
01:46:45,830 --> 01:46:49,200
Even 5 minutes are enough for rape.

1503
01:46:49,870 --> 01:46:53,580
The third story, the accused
and victim were having an affair.

1504
01:46:53,660 --> 01:46:54,950
Irrelevant.

1505
01:46:55,330 --> 01:46:58,750
Because the case is not about whether
they were having an affair or not.

1506
01:46:58,870 --> 01:47:03,200
The case is about whether Anjali
was raped on the 8th of July or not.

1507
01:47:03,290 --> 01:47:06,700
And since the Defence
had no concrete evidence..

1508
01:47:06,830 --> 01:47:10,410
..he presented false
evidence in the court.

1509
01:47:10,830 --> 01:47:12,200
The hard drive story.

1510
01:47:12,290 --> 01:47:14,450
Then comes the Rohan Khurana story.

1511
01:47:14,580 --> 01:47:16,580
Even if we believe
the accused's statement..

1512
01:47:16,870 --> 01:47:20,200
..he didn't just rape Anjali
Dangle on the 8th of July..

1513
01:47:20,290 --> 01:47:24,290
..in fact,
he's been raping her for a longer time.

1514
01:47:24,580 --> 01:47:26,830
A man who is in a position of power..

1515
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,040
..regardless of what profession he is..

1516
01:47:29,120 --> 01:47:35,290
..tells a woman that sleeping
with him will catapult her career..

1517
01:47:35,410 --> 01:47:37,700
..and even if the woman gives in.

1518
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:39,580
It is still rape.

1519
01:47:39,700 --> 01:47:43,410
Because he is indirectly telling
her that if she doesn't comply..

1520
01:47:43,540 --> 01:47:45,790
..then it can hurt her career.

1521
01:47:46,120 --> 01:47:50,950
Section 375 clearly states that
for a sexual act to be legitimate..

1522
01:47:51,080 --> 01:47:54,830
..both the will and consent
of the woman are necessary.

1523
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,660
In fact, will has been
placed before consent.

1524
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:02,500
A woman's will is more
important than her consent.

1525
01:48:02,580 --> 01:48:05,750
In our country, rape is considered
as tarnishing one's honour..

1526
01:48:05,870 --> 01:48:07,950
..and losing one's dignity.

1527
01:48:08,620 --> 01:48:12,750
The victim has to hide
her identity face from the world.

1528
01:48:13,330 --> 01:48:16,700
But even in this scenario,
without caring about her career..

1529
01:48:16,830 --> 01:48:20,580
..and her parent's financial condition..

1530
01:48:20,660 --> 01:48:22,660
..Anjali Dangle made a
resolution to tell the world..

1531
01:48:22,750 --> 01:48:25,290
..about the sexual
crime done against her.

1532
01:48:25,830 --> 01:48:29,450
Your Honours, this case
isn't just about Anjali Dangle.

1533
01:48:29,540 --> 01:48:32,790
It must encourage other
survivors to come forward..

1534
01:48:32,950 --> 01:48:38,830
..who have experienced sexual abuse
in the workplace at any point in time.

1535
01:48:39,290 --> 01:48:40,830
I pray to this Honourable court..

1536
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:44,080
..that they punish this
high-class privileged man..

1537
01:48:44,450 --> 01:48:46,790
..to the maximum possible sentence.

1538
01:48:47,080 --> 01:48:50,750
The prosecution seeks life
imprisonment for Rohan Ravi Khurana.

1539
01:48:51,410 --> 01:48:52,450
Thank you.

1540
01:48:53,080 --> 01:48:54,580
Defence Council.

1541
01:48:56,870 --> 01:48:59,870
Your Honours,
at the beginning of the trial..

1542
01:49:00,700 --> 01:49:02,750
..Ms. Gandhi showed these photographs..

1543
01:49:03,660 --> 01:49:06,250
..and claimed that Mr. Khurana
is a privileged man.

1544
01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:11,290
I would like to show the honourable
court how privileged he actually is.

1545
01:49:11,500 --> 01:49:16,750
Privileged to be featured for more
than 300 hours on Prime Time Television.

1546
01:49:17,620 --> 01:49:21,330
The result..declared guilty
by the honourable media court.

1547
01:49:21,830 --> 01:49:26,700
Privileged..to be the subject
of more than 1.5 million posts.

1548
01:49:27,500 --> 01:49:32,040
The result..produced guilty
by the people's court of Facebook.

1549
01:49:33,080 --> 01:49:38,200
Privileged..to have been
hashtagged #hangtherapist..

1550
01:49:38,700 --> 01:49:40,750
..by the Twitter high court of India.

1551
01:49:41,700 --> 01:49:43,700
Now let's shed some light
on the facts of this case.

1552
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:46,290
Can we claim without a reason of doubt..

1553
01:49:46,370 --> 01:49:49,160
..that the Police Investigation
was unbiased and fair?

1554
01:49:50,120 --> 01:49:50,950
No.

1555
01:49:51,290 --> 01:49:55,910
Anjali Dangle claimed
that she screamed..

1556
01:49:56,830 --> 01:49:59,620
..raised a commotion,
during the alleged incident.

1557
01:50:00,580 --> 01:50:03,160
But did anyone hear her scream?

1558
01:50:04,370 --> 01:50:05,290
No.

1559
01:50:05,870 --> 01:50:12,000
Anjali Dangle testified that
Rohan Khurana molested her in the van.

1560
01:50:13,370 --> 01:50:15,750
But did she complain to anyone?

1561
01:50:16,620 --> 01:50:17,620
No.

1562
01:50:18,040 --> 01:50:20,330
Allegedly, even after getting molested..

1563
01:50:20,580 --> 01:50:24,620
..did Anjali Dangle refuse going to Ravi Khurana's house?

1564
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:27,870
No.

1565
01:50:28,250 --> 01:50:30,830
Did Anjali Dangle tell
the Honourable court..

1566
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:35,290
..that the injury marks on her face
and body were caused by her brother?

1567
01:50:36,830 --> 01:50:37,750
No.

1568
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:41,000
Did Anjali Dangle tell
the court and the Police..

1569
01:50:41,330 --> 01:50:46,620
..that on the 8th of July,
she used the staircase and not the lift?

1570
01:50:46,750 --> 01:50:47,750
No.

1571
01:50:47,910 --> 01:50:52,790
Is Anjali Dangle a truthful
and dependable witness?

1572
01:50:53,410 --> 01:50:55,830
No. She is not.

1573
01:50:57,120 --> 01:50:59,870
A single negation is
enough to raise doubts.

1574
01:51:00,120 --> 01:51:02,250
But this case is filled with it.

1575
01:51:02,950 --> 01:51:04,870
But more important your Honours..

1576
01:51:07,290 --> 01:51:10,750
..is that the prosecution
is doing a grave disservice..

1577
01:51:12,080 --> 01:51:14,410
..to the very women it seeks to protect.

1578
01:51:14,830 --> 01:51:17,950
Because every false
rape claim is another nail..

1579
01:51:19,950 --> 01:51:22,540
..in the coffin of
the genuine rape victim.

1580
01:51:32,910 --> 01:51:34,950
We will take a short recess.

1581
01:51:35,450 --> 01:51:39,000
After which the court
shall return its verdict.

1582
01:52:17,120 --> 01:52:21,120
Punish the Rohan Khurana!

1583
01:52:21,250 --> 01:52:28,290
Justice for Anjali Dangle!

1584
01:53:27,830 --> 01:53:31,370
After hearing the Prosecution
and Defence arguments..

1585
01:53:32,330 --> 01:53:36,910
..the division court believes
that both are right in their view.

1586
01:53:37,200 --> 01:53:43,700
But in such complicated cases, there
is only one way to reach the verdict.

1587
01:53:43,830 --> 01:53:45,540
To follow the Law.

1588
01:53:45,620 --> 01:53:48,200
And the Law is very clear in such cases.

1589
01:53:48,540 --> 01:53:54,540
If a man is above a woman in
a position of power, like in this case..

1590
01:53:54,830 --> 01:54:01,250
..Mr. Rohan Khurana, and if the sexual
act between them is medically proven..

1591
01:54:01,330 --> 01:54:05,040
..and if the woman admits in court..

1592
01:54:05,410 --> 01:54:11,200
..that the act occurred
against her will or permission..

1593
01:54:11,330 --> 01:54:15,580
..then the court will
have to believe her..

1594
01:54:15,950 --> 01:54:19,500
..until the accused doesn't
present any solid evidence.

1595
01:54:20,700 --> 01:54:27,450
Hence under sections 375,
376, 340, 342, 354..

1596
01:54:27,830 --> 01:54:30,700
..and 506 of the Indian Penal Code..

1597
01:54:31,290 --> 01:54:34,450
..this court upholds the
judgement of the court of sessions..

1598
01:54:34,700 --> 01:54:36,370
..and sentences the accused..

1599
01:54:36,500 --> 01:54:40,330
..Mr. Rohan Ravi Khurana to
10 years of rigorous imprisonment.

1600
01:54:40,950 --> 01:54:43,790
Madam, I am going to
challenge this judgement.

1601
01:54:43,870 --> 01:54:47,700
You, Mr. Saluja, would be
well within your rights to do that.

1602
01:54:48,500 --> 01:54:49,540
Adjourned.

1603
01:55:02,040 --> 01:55:06,500
I am filing a review petition.
We have a strong case.

1604
01:55:06,950 --> 01:55:07,950
Look at me.

1605
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:12,370
Don't lose hope.

1606
01:55:36,410 --> 01:55:37,450
Kainaz.

1607
01:55:39,500 --> 01:55:40,620
It's not over.

1608
01:55:40,870 --> 01:55:45,410
Tarun said he will
challenge the judgement.

1609
01:55:49,950 --> 01:55:51,500
It's over for me, Rohan.

1610
01:55:54,290 --> 01:55:55,410
Best of luck.

1611
01:57:10,450 --> 01:57:12,370
Tarun was right.

1612
01:57:13,450 --> 01:57:15,540
What sir did wasn't rape.

1613
01:57:17,830 --> 01:57:19,700
But it was nothing short of it.

1614
01:57:24,910 --> 01:57:26,830
Thank you for your help.

1615
01:57:34,290 --> 01:57:38,830
'This case is not about Ms. Dangle's rape,
it's about her revenge.'

1616
01:57:41,370 --> 01:57:44,160
'All this is not possible
within 22 minutes.'

1617
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:46,870
'Especially when
the woman is resisting.'

1618
01:57:48,660 --> 01:57:52,580
'The intercourse happened with
Ms. Dangle's consent and participation.'

1619
01:58:02,700 --> 01:58:05,750
'The accused and prosecutrix
were involved in an affair.'

1620
01:58:06,450 --> 01:58:08,370
'And when it ended..'

1621
01:58:09,660 --> 01:58:13,870
'..Anjali Dangle filed a false
and vindictive charge of rape.'

1622
01:58:41,870 --> 01:58:43,290
Hey, daddy..

1623
01:58:45,200 --> 01:58:46,500
- Hey..
- Hey..

1624
01:58:46,870 --> 01:58:48,080
I lost the case.

1625
01:58:48,200 --> 01:58:49,200
I am sorry.

1626
01:58:49,910 --> 01:58:52,330
And my license was
suspended for six months.

1627
01:58:53,750 --> 01:58:55,950
Can't tell you how
happy I am to hear that.

1628
01:59:03,500 --> 01:59:04,750
- Hi..
- Hi..

1629
01:59:04,870 --> 01:59:06,660
- Hi.
- Congratulations!

1630
01:59:06,750 --> 01:59:08,620
Student exceeded her teacher.

1631
01:59:09,250 --> 01:59:10,160
I am happy for you.

1632
01:59:11,200 --> 01:59:13,410
- So good to see you.
- Hi.. Come.

1633
01:59:28,540 --> 01:59:30,700
Congratulations, Ms. Gandhi.

1634
01:59:42,370 --> 01:59:46,370
Sir, I don't think justice was done.

1635
01:59:52,500 --> 01:59:54,700
We're not in the business of Justice.

1636
01:59:56,200 --> 01:59:57,750
We're in the business of Law.

1637
02:00:01,120 --> 02:00:02,160
Come.
