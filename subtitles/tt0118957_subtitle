1
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:24,382
Dedicated to Manmohan Desai,
one of the great directors

2
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:33,398
Action

3
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:56,915
Tickets for seats, tickets for berths
Speak up, guys

4
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,387
Even the train has arrived,
when will you give the ticket?

5
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:01,619
it'll depart after half an hour
Hey, hero what do you want?

6
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:04,228
Trust me, I only have 1 7 0 rupees

7
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:07,333
Get on the side, nothing less
than 200 rupees. Yes?

8
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:10,636
Charging 7 5 rupees extra per ticket
isn't very fair,

9
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:12,964
You are taking undue advantage of
people's despair

10
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:16,575
Hey, no money no talk. If you
have to lecture go and do it in election

11
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,871
You did not tell me which compartment
is the ticket for!

12
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:22,276
Go at no. 4. My man is there

13
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:24,480
Tell him you have been sent by Gafoor
Be quick

14
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:25,845
Mr. Gafoor Yes

15
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:27,246
I hope you don't mind if I call you that

16
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:30,355
I mean, please do some concession
for the little children

17
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,253
Next time I'll make pay
the price you ask for

18
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:35,252
Don't argue, it's not the question of
big or small,

19
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:39,262
If you keep haggling, then you'd have to
get full tickets for them too

20
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:44,464
Please be considerate & give the tickets
where'd we go with children !

21
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,402
Okay, you and children get in,
I'll just come with the tickets

22
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:51,066
Man, I don't carry the tickets with me,
it's just too risky

23
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:57,477
Wow, what a car!
This is a real car, man !

24
00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:01,442
And here, what a nice bungalow!

25
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:03,955
Hey. . . Yeah, and this is a plane

26
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,455
in which we can never travel

27
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:09,220
Raja, stop dreaming and come to earth

28
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:11,059
I am on the earth

29
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:13,357
Most of our life has been wasted
on the railway platform

30
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:18,163
I mean, just look, the whole world
is having fun in big cities

31
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:23,038
Forget the big cities, hand me
the tickets 3 half, and 3 full

32
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:25,575
Not for that train,
from this pocket here

33
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:28,680
Tickets for seats, tickets for berths

34
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:33,352
What kind of life is this?

35
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:38,446
I mean, we're here since morning
and we get only 840 rupees!

36
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:41,082
Look, Raja, with the talents
and education you have,

37
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:46,254
had you been doing a job somewhere
this would have been a month's salary

38
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:48,494
Learn to be contented with what you get

39
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,865
Oh yeah? Just for the name sake
we live in Amirpur( rich town ),

40
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:54,266
but we could be like one of
the biggest paupers around

41
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:55,465
Oh, man, you'll never learn !

42
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,666
What is this customs officer doing here?

43
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,404
Take it to the control room, over there

44
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:03,343
He seems to be throwing his
weight around. Come let's have a look

45
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:05,750
Keep it carefully near my desk

46
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,218
Hello, sir why is there so much
police around? What's in the trunk?

47
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:11,754
It's the pay-roll of postal department

48
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:14,189
We've to send it to Agra
by tonight's train

49
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:18,027
Till that time it's going to be
at the station, in my custody

50
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:20,631
Should easily be about
two and a half million inside

51
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,664
Two and a half million !

52
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:25,360
Yeah, but you won't get anything
by staring at each other

53
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,369
Then? Come, let's talk over tea

54
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:33,340
You see, all the extra money which
I extract doesn't even last a week

55
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,774
So I have been thinking to go
for something really big,

56
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,384
and spend the rest of life in peace

57
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,248
But the point is, if I was to do it
myself I would be investigated

58
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:45,083
If somebody else does it,
I would be the inquiry in-charge

59
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:48,227
How would that be, sir?
Try to understand

60
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:50,252
You handle four of the policemen,
I'll handle the other four,

61
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:54,194
and if at all necessary,
give me a couple of punches too

62
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,496
So that next day I can show
my dislodged tooth to my senior

63
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:01,606
And say, ''The thieves have looted
all the money, Sir''

64
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:04,003
Man, I really admire his brains?
Is it a deal then?

65
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:06,134
Am I that stupid not to accept it!

66
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:07,301
Here hold this

67
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:11,447
So see you then, at midnight
Okay

68
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,651
At midnight!
Have you given a thought to your Mother?

69
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:18,222
Oh, yeah I didn't think about that!

70
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:23,761
Mother?

71
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:26,329
Mother!

72
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,434
Raja, what is it, son?

73
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,836
Why don't you speak something?

74
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:37,135
Look, your sister has sent a telegram
She is very ill

75
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:39,277
She has urgently called you

76
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,640
Oh, dear! Leela has taken ill?

77
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,840
Yes, Mother. I know that you're not on
speaking terms with her

78
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:47,578
But at times like this you should forget
all the disputes

79
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:49,745
No, my son, I'm not at all
cross with her

80
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,948
Hurry up and get me a train ticket
for tomorrow

81
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:54,889
Raja, I couldn't get ticket for tomorrow
so I got it for today

82
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:56,356
Gafoor, you did a good thing

83
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:59,593
How can I leave today,
even my prayers are incomplete

84
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,391
Mother, you don't know anything

85
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:06,334
When the telegram says somebody is sick,
one should go immediately

86
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:07,234
Why?

87
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:11,407
Because sometimes they write ''sick''
even if the person has died

88
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:13,203
Oh, God ! Don't utter words like that

89
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:16,338
Probably your sister is longing
to meet you,

90
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:18,616
she may have something important
to say to you,

91
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:20,309
possibly she might be at a dying stage!

92
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,250
Mother, you should leave immediately

93
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:25,113
The train leaves in an hour
Mother, please come

94
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:27,419
Yes, we ought to hurry up

95
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,954
Hey guys, why are you beating us?

96
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,390
Hey, listen to me

97
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,787
Don't beat him, he'll die

98
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,291
What are you doing,
why are you beating us?

99
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:07,998
What do you want,
why are you beating us up?

100
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,429
Hey, man

101
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:12,999
just a moment. . .
beat me only two blows, okay

102
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:19,137
My tooth is broken already,
why are you still beating me?

103
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:23,641
Are you planning to break all the
thirty-two teeth?

104
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:27,115
Rascal, want us to do your thieving?
Are we thieves?

105
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:30,222
If you turn us into thieves,
then we will do a thorough job of it

106
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:34,725
And there will be no share for you
Get up! Up!

107
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:37,660
Hey, Gafoor, where are you?

108
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,321
Pick up the trunk. Hurry up,
we've got a flight to catch

109
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,464
If we miss it we won't be able to run
and catch it

110
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:39,357
What a difference there is in a railway
station and an airport, isn't it?

111
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:40,822
As between the earth and sky

112
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:43,154
The train on the ground,
while the 'plane flies in the sky

113
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:46,229
And the 'plane doesn't make any sound,
while on the station bang, bang, bang !

114
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:48,957
It drives you crazy. Hey, listen
Sit down

115
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,660
I've had an idea Spit it out

116
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:54,272
Can't we black-market the
'plane tickets too?

117
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,232
Just goes to prove how stupid you are

118
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:58,342
You fool, we are rich people,

119
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:02,375
And a person after becoming rich,
from black becomes white!

120
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:05,308
Daddy, hi Dad

121
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:08,676
How was your trip?

122
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,379
Fantastic

123
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:28,302
Hey, hey, it started. Strange vehicle,
started without a sound ! Sorry, sorry

124
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:30,506
Well done, what great looks!

125
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:36,414
Hey, this town is really beautiful,
and it's people even more beautiful

126
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,949
You said we would also stay in a
beautiful place, didn't you?

127
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:41,848
You mentioned the name of the hotel
as being something like Saand. . .

128
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,455
Not Saand, but Sun and Sand

129
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:46,851
Tickets for seats, tickets for berth

130
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,620
Dadar Express, Rajdhani Express,
Calcutta mail, Howdah Express

131
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:52,229
Here comes the constable,
get on the side

132
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,963
Sir, Sir, forgive me, I didn't. . .

133
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:57,029
Raja, where are we?

134
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:58,225
Mumbai, Mumbai

135
00:08:58,571 --> 00:08:59,765
Two days ago we left Amirpur

136
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,270
Weren't you on the bed,
how did you get on the floor?

137
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:05,366
Oh, man ! Raja, money is a wretched thing

138
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:08,808
It makes a dog out of man,
a dog who stays awake all night

139
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:12,382
I could not go off to sleep over there,
so I thought I'd hug this and sleep

140
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,109
What is the time?

141
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:15,379
It is twelve O'clock

142
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,318
Twelve! Yes, twelve

143
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,317
This is the first time
I have slept so late,

144
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:22,786
usually I had to get up at six every day
for that early train

145
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:34,396
Hey, hey, Gafoor, there is
a swimming pool here!

146
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:39,002
I've bathed enough in the
miserable stream of Amirpur,

147
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:42,410
today I will dive in here

148
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:45,216
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

149
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:47,615
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sister

150
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,347
Don't know how to swim

151
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:54,820
Enjoying yourself, eh Gafoor?

152
00:09:55,461 --> 00:10:00,421
Raja, what fun, man
You've made my life, pal

153
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,771
Hey, is that the girl from the station?

154
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,042
Yes, Gafoor, she is the girl
from the airport

155
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:22,382
When I saw her the first time,
I knew I had found my life's destination

156
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:25,752
Gafoor, I want to marry her

157
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:30,191
Raja my friend, you are trying to run
faster than an Express train !

158
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:32,296
You haven't forgotten your old ways,
have you?

159
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:33,487
What do you mean?

160
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:37,658
I mean look at the girl, her face is
that of a girl from a rich family

161
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,462
And do I look like a beggar?

162
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,105
Well, even I don't look like
a beggar these days

163
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:45,266
But don't forget that we became rich
very, very recently

164
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:49,778
Shut up and go find out who she is,
what she does, and. . .

165
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:51,974
where she stays

166
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,617
Did you find out anything?
Everything

167
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,157
She is a doctor

168
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:03,521
Doctor! Yes

169
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:05,629
What a beautiful doctor! Yes

170
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,321
One will just have to become her patient

171
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:11,228
She is not a heart doctor, but a
brain doctor. She treats mad people

172
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,133
That is even better How's that?

173
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:14,762
I know of a mad man Oh Yes!

174
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,738
Who is it? You

175
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:18,844
Forget it!

176
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:22,378
BOMBAY POLYCLI N I C
Neha Sharma ( Psychiatrist)

177
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,048
Sister-in-law, sister, sister

178
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,448
Gafoor, compose yourself

179
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:30,054
What is going on? Who are you?

180
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,781
Sorry, Madam, he escaped from me

181
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:34,255
Sister-in-law you are very beautiful
What is his problem

182
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:38,556
Whenever he sees a beautiful girl,
his train gets off the tracks

183
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:42,393
and he runs after her addressing her
as his sister-in-law

184
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:45,265
Please sit down

185
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:48,998
Thank you. Sit down Gafoor, sit down

186
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:53,673
And who might his brother be for whom
he is trying to find a wife?

187
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:56,675
Me, he regards me as his brother

188
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:00,408
Actually Gafoor is my driver,
he loves me very much

189
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:02,917
He has only one ambition in life,
that I should get married

190
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:06,218
Sister-in-law, why don't you
marry my brother

191
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,215
Shut up! Shut up!

192
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:10,122
I will slap you

193
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:14,288
Oh, no, no. What are you doing, such
cases are handled with love, not anger

194
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,427
Please don't worry, I will treat him

195
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:19,831
Thank you doctor, thank you very much

196
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:22,167
Just bring his train
back to the platform

197
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:25,367
I don't care how much it costs

198
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:28,846
Why do you look at me like that?

199
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,240
You said he was your driver,

200
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:36,285
And you say you don't mind
spending any amount on him !

201
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:41,653
He is not just a driver, doctor,
he is first and foremost a human being

202
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:44,962
He has been with me since my childhood

203
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:49,261
If one had a dog for so long,
he would start loving him as deeply

204
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:51,402
And he's after all, a human being

205
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,864
Once his life starts on the right track,

206
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:55,700
I will be the happiest man on earth

207
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,673
You are both a good man & a good talker

208
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:01,211
I talk even better with a cup of tea

209
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:04,614
Why don't you have tea with me tomorrow?

210
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,315
But tomorrow evening I. . .

211
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,352
As it is, you do go for a swim
every evening,

212
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:11,212
you could join me in the coffee shop
for a cup of tea afterwards

213
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,552
Sister-in-law

214
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,620
You mean. . .? Exactly,

215
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:17,318
we've been putting up at the
very same hotel

216
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:19,422
Actually I have come from Amirpur. . .
I mean from America

217
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,429
I n connection with business over here

218
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:25,833
Despite this being my own country,
I still feel very lonely here

219
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:30,206
If you join me for tea, it'll take away
some of the loneliness

220
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:32,233
All right, I will come

221
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:33,572
Thank you

222
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,978
I have written down some tests for him,
please get these done

223
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,741
Sister-in-law, you are great

224
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:40,351
Bye bye

225
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:41,953
Okay

226
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:43,679
Sister-in-law Come, Gafoor

227
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:46,484
Sister-in-law
She'll certainly be your sister-in-law

228
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:48,260
Sister-in-law!

229
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:54,656
Say, Gafoor, she talked so nicely
with me in her clinic

230
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,995
and if she does accept
my invitation to tea. . .

231
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,003
it would mean she does like me a little

232
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:06,806
Raja, why do you start with the second
step before completing the first?

233
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:10,814
Don't move too fast or you are likely
to fall flat on your face

234
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,048
You have hardly met her twice,
and already you are. . . !

235
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,244
Hey, here she comes

236
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:16,246
Go on, you get lost

237
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,014
Go, man, scram
Don't rush things

238
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:20,954
Remember, it's just tea that you've
treated her to, don't talk too much

239
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:27,626
Come, please take a seat

240
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,063
Thank you Do sit down

241
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:31,728
What will you have?

242
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,931
If I'm not mistaken
you've invited me for tea

243
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,036
Oh yes, yes

244
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:42,837
But before having tea, you had better
make sure it's the right thing to do

245
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:44,472
I am afraid I don't understand

246
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:48,445
Look, I do not know
how to beat around the bush

247
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,287
and so I will simply say it

248
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,890
He's had it, he's had it today!

249
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,754
''Thinking of getting married I am,

250
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:57,690
Therefore invited you for tea I have''

251
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,387
What? Very true

252
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:02,699
That Gafoor whom I brought over to you,

253
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:04,632
He is not mad at all

254
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,306
It is I who am mad

255
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:14,839
from the day I saw you at Bombay airport

256
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:21,209
Mr. Raj, do you really think you can,

257
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:26,217
pretend that Gafoor is mad and you can
bring him to me and then fool me?

258
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:30,621
I knew the moment I saw him
that Gafoor was not mad at all

259
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:32,660
What? Yes, that is right

260
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:38,329
And I noticed you looking at me
in the swimming pool

261
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:41,071
No doubt, you did appear quite
good looking and handsome

262
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,939
But how smart you are,
I have only found out today

263
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:50,378
And like you I too prefer
to talk straight

264
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:53,582
And the truth is that,

265
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:57,148
even I like you

266
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,754
I like you very much

267
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,223
Really? Yes

268
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:05,429
Raja, I can't believe it
How did you manage everything so fast?

269
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:10,591
When in love, one must do things
with speed

270
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:13,227
otherwise it can become too late

271
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:14,594
And, Gafoor. . . What is it?

272
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,301
After today. . . don't give me wrong advice
I won't

273
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:21,438
Shall we go?

274
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:58,085
You were singing with her, weren't you?

275
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:00,350
And you'd also have pledged your love?

276
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:02,216
And you must have bashed me up too?

277
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:05,863
Raja, dreams are very different
from reality

278
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,831
I will not stop you from doing anything
in your dreams

279
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:11,025
Do whatever you wish to do

280
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,030
But in reality,

281
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:16,470
Don't take any step before your
friendship has become really firm

282
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:19,167
She is not some dumb village dame,

283
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:20,936
She is Doctor Neha, understand?

284
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:24,845
If you are rash, you could earn yourself
a nice slap

285
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:31,579
How's this for an answer? Don't show me
your face ever again, now get out

286
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:35,656
I said get out or I will call the police

287
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:39,189
What is the matter, Ms Neha?
Has he been rude? If you wish I'll. . .

288
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:40,763
No, let it be. He was bothering me

289
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:44,458
Says he has been watching me swimming
and has fallen in love with me

290
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,194
''I love you''

291
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:48,369
I salute you

292
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:50,802
I don't like such roadside Romeos at all

293
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,911
What kind of people do you like?

294
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:58,113
Like you, well behaved,
well cultured people

295
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:02,014
who know how to talk to girls,
how to behave around them

296
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,313
who know how to respect girls
Thank you

297
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:07,955
I believe we could indeed be
good friends

298
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:10,560
Oh, Ms Neha, thank you very much

299
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:13,228
Sir, there's a call for you

300
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:14,332
My phone call !

301
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:16,328
Ms Neha, please be seated,
I won't be long

302
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:18,026
Please take a seat Okay

303
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:20,461
Well, what do you say now?

304
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:24,234
Didn't she say something like
well-cultull. . . oh, whatever

305
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:27,435
Oh well, just be what she thinks you are

306
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:30,571
Don't do anything stupid or your story
will end before it has started

307
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:34,549
First put your friendship
on a firm footing

308
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:37,480
I hope too much time is
not wasted in this

309
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:40,284
giving someone else a chance
to come between us!

310
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,793
Bunnu, Bunnu, listen to me son

311
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:44,256
No Pa

312
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:46,488
Bunnu? No, Pa, no

313
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:48,263
Son !

314
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,868
Pa, if I don't learn
how will I enter the water?

315
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:53,264
Oh son, if you do not enter the water
how will you learn?

316
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:57,806
When I'm so afraid of the tub
why do you insist on the pool?

317
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:00,604
Don't cry my child, look at how the
other children are swimming

318
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:04,614
No, Pa, I still can't swim, because I
deliberately did not wear it

319
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,218
Did not wear what?

320
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,217
Swimming trunks

321
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:13,256
Don't worry, I have brought them for you

322
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:14,455
Pa no, no, no, Pa

323
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:17,026
Go inside and change, go inside son

324
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,821
No, I will change right here,
I know the trick

325
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,292
No son, keep tricks for later. . .

326
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:23,028
That. . . I am scared in the bathroom. . .

327
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:52,253
Yes, Bunnu has put it on,
he has put it on

328
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:59,660
Okay now, jump. Just look at. . .
No, pa, I won't

329
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:02,396
A big boy like you is scared? Watch me

330
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:06,202
Hey fatso, shut up and swim or
I'll give you one. . .

331
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:07,807
See, how all the little children are. . .

332
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:08,945
Pa, no, no

333
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,240
Good, go on, get in

334
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:12,645
Please no, please no. Okay, okay

335
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:18,722
Go on, go on son, yes, that's it

336
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:20,154
Mummy

337
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:21,723
Yes go on, a little more

338
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,459
Look, look, Bunnu is going to dive

339
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:27,928

348

Go for it!

349
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:05,799

352
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:11,300
He will dive in straight now

353
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:13,343
Oh, God save us

354
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:18,005
Well done. One. . . two. . . and. . .

Coming, Pa, I am coming. I am trying

357
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,627
Well done my son, come on

358
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:36,563
Bunnu my son come on, this is
a lift not a swimming pool

359
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:40,967
Oh come on, stop fooling around. If you
want the bathroom, it is that side

360
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:42,231
Why are you disturbing everybody?

361
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,535
Keep quiet, I'll slap you

362
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:47,441
But to slap him you will have to
come in the lift, won't you

363
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:48,772
Come into the lift and slap him

364
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:51,745
He is lucky he is inside

365
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:55,046
Okay, say a prayer and come in
Good, say a prayer

366
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:56,880
God save me

367
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:01,291
Hurry up Yes, yes, he is coming

368
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:03,423
Come in, come in my son

369
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:06,587
Hey wait, wait a bit

370
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,830
Pa, c'mon. Come we will take the stairs

371
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:13,503
Thirteen floors!

372
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:22,041
Pa, are you tired?

373
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:23,612
Sound !

374
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,340
Let's go in

375
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:36,355
Why are you panting so much?

376
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:38,186
Sound, sound is missing !

377
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:39,958
Because I have climbed thirteen stories
that is why

378
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:41,462
I n spite of the lift?

379
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:44,124
If I could have come by the lift,
I would not have had to come here

380
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,260
Tell the doctor that
Bunnu's father has come

381
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,427
Bunnu? Him

382
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:48,732
Me here Oh !

383
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:50,135
One minute

384
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:53,476
So tell me, what is the problem?

385
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:55,545
I have many problems

386
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,444
The biggest problem is that
no one understands my problem

387
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:00,813
I don't know where to start

388
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:03,317
I am very scared most of the time

389
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:06,987
Fire. . . I am very afraid of fire

390
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:11,692
Whenever I see a match box I think,
a matchstick will come out,

391
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:15,923
and light up automatically and it will
set fire to my whole body

392
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:17,631
When I see a crowd,

393
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:22,296
I feel people are trampling one another
to get ahead

394
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:27,244
When I hear horns blaring I feel
a pack of dogs is barking

395
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:29,345
and. . .

396
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,413
You know the lift,

397
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:37,418
I cannot enter it, I feel frightened

398
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:42,525
I feel it's doors will close suddenly
and my head will break

399
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:48,325
Heights. . . when I stand on a height I feel

400
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:51,028
no, no you cannot throw me down,
you bastard

401
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:54,034
don't throw me, don't do that,
no, no don't

402
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,074
Smoke suffocates me greatly

403
00:27:58,376 --> 00:28:05,373
I feel my heart will start palpitating
fast and I'll have a heart attack. . .

404
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:10,216
like there is a great pressure
in the bowels

405
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:13,824
but one cannot reach the lavatory. . .

406
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:17,923
you cannot imagine what it feels like

407
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:21,595
all this happens to me

408
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,732
There are many other problems

409
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:26,734
Bunnu, after listening to you
I am of the opinion that,

410
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:31,399
your trouble is no more serious
than a cold or fever

411
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,204
Excuse me, Bunnu

412
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:36,212
Hello Hello Ms Neha

413
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:37,712
It is me, Raj Kumar

414
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:40,043
Oh, I am so sorry

415
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,743
I know very well that we had to
go for a show today

416
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:45,947
As I had told you the show is at
three O'clock, not six!

417
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:47,421
You see, it is like this, Raj

418
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,255
That I was so engrossed in talking to
Bunnu that I forgot the time

419
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:52,293
Bunnu? Who is this Bunnu?

420
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,661
A new patient of mine

421
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:55,231
Oh ho, a patient!

422
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:57,458
I wish I could be your patient too

423
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:00,399
Then you would spend some time
with me too

424
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,301
Please, Raj, don't be offended

425
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:04,305
Shall we see this programme tomorrow?

426
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:05,973
No, no, it does not matter

427
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:10,605
But tomorrow's show is at three O'clock,
not six, okay?

428
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:12,409
One hundred percent

429
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:14,276
Okay, Neha. Bye bye

430
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:15,415
Hey, what happened?

431
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:16,679
Nothing much

432
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:19,381
Some patient called Bunnu turned up

433
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,286
Bunnu ! who is he, who is he?

434
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:23,924
Pa, I'm okay, I'm fine,
I'm feeling better. Pa, I am okay, yes

435
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:26,597
I am okay, I am all right
C'mon, we will climb down 1 3 floors

436
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:28,789
No stairs, I will go by lift
Lift?!

437
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,833
Yeah, I'm okay, I'm fine,
I'm feeling better

438
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:31,934
Thank you very much

439
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:32,831
No sound, sir!

440
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:35,199
Thank you Oh, you are welcome

441
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,837
Sir, my hand !

442
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:39,608
It happens, it happens

443
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,911
Yeah Mom, my heart is starting to aspire

444
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:46,915
and I don't feel giddy when I use
baby steps

445
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:48,518
Well done, son, well done

446
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,117
Can you see how well our Bunnu has
started to walk!

447
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:53,315
Yes, I have seen, I have seen

448
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,358
I have been seeing this all the way back

449
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:56,186
Quiet!

450
00:29:56,227 --> 00:30:00,220
Baby steps, baby, yeah baby

451
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:02,431
What's happened son,
why have you stopped?

452
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,933
Mom, I cannot climb stairs with
baby steps

453
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:10,336
Son, the doctor did say you are to use
baby steps, but not everywhere

454
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:13,075
You will have to climb steps
in the normal way

455
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:16,042
But Pa, until I meet Neha
how can I climb stairs?

456
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:18,081
Then keep standing with your baby steps

457
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:19,773
You cannot go to your bedroom today

458
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:22,647
No, no! Bunnu

459
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:24,487
No, no, no!

460
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,454
Yes, yes, son, relax. Calm yourself

461
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,955
How sarcastic could you be!

462
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:35,656
You know how he reacts if anything is
done against his wishes

463
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:42,601
Look, son, it is quite late and the
doctor will also not be at her clinic

464
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:46,908
Daddy will take you tomorrow to meet her

465
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:51,910
Don't cry Ma, I will sleep in
your and Pa's bedroom

466
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:53,675
I'm okay, I'm all right

467
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:57,286
This doctor has not cured him,
but given another disease

468
00:30:57,622 --> 00:30:58,884
''Baby Steps''

469
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:04,321
Bunnu !

470
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:06,029
Ms Neha are you leaving?

471
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:07,823
Yes, the clinic is closed now

472
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,227
But you people come tomorrow

473
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:15,571
Tomorrow? Doctor, please, one minute

474
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,275
If you won't see him today. . .

475
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:22,238
Look I have a problem today, I really do
I have no time and. . .

476
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,642
But you do not understand. . .

477
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:26,248
No, Papa, no Look, I have to go

478
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:29,182
Doctor, this is exactly what
I was afraid of

479
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:33,290
Please, do see him or he will create
havoc in the hospital

480
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:37,784
Come along then Thank you

481
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:41,664
It is six-thirty

482
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:44,858
What do you think could have happened,
why has she not come today?

483
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:48,268
Do you think her yesterday's patient has
dropped in again today?

484
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,397
Sir, a letter for you
Look, a letter from Neha

485
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:53,209
Go on, read it. Is my suspicion right?

486
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:00,810
Yes, it is right

487
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:05,012
She was about to leave for here
when that Bunnu turned up

488
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:07,418
The poor thing has apologized for
not coming

489
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:10,425
But how on the earth could you've harmed
this Bunnu that

490
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:14,120
he keeps cropping up so inconveniently
for you. I will get this Bunnu's. . .

491
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,332
Excuse me, Bunnu

492
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:20,067
Hello Hello

493
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:22,468

00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,872
Yes I am calling from Mr. Bunnu's house

00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:27,238
Please call Mr. Bunnu to the phone

496
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:30,245
Just a minute
Bunnu, phone from your house

497
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:31,473
From my house? Yes

498
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:32,775
Who could it be?

499
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:37,184
Mr. Bunnu, here talk to your father

500
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:42,656

502
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:47,856

00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:50,398
Who is this bastard talking?

504
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:53,396
I am your father talking, you moron

505
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:55,300
What has happened to my father's voice?

506
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:59,170
No, you cannot be my Pa
My Pa does not use such bad words

507
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:01,406
Besides, he is sitting outside

508
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:02,945
Who is this talking?

509
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:06,411
Hey you, son of Pa,
I am your real father talking

510
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:07,643
Now listen carefully,

511
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:12,245
If I ever see you again anywhere near
that lady doctor,

512
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:16,821
I will push the train of your life
off its rails

513
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:19,521
And here is my answer, Mr. Train Driver,

514
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:24,430
If I don't come to the doctor,
who'll make me all right, you or your Pa?

515
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,827
What is the matter Bunnu, who was it?

516
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:28,767
I don't know. Some mad man cursing me

517
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:29,872
Are you okay?

518
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:31,531
I'm okay, I'm fine, I'm feeling better

519
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:32,734
Good

520
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:40,248
You idiot, if not your own then

521
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:42,385
then you should at least have thought of
the good name of our family

522
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:45,147
Does the family's good name get
besmirched by getting married?

523
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:49,350
On the contrary, the family grows
after marriage

524
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:50,456
Uncle?

525
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,989
Oh, little girl, how are you

526
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,789
Right and fine, Uncle

527
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:58,359
What is the matter? Uncle is here
after so many years and you're yelling !

528
00:33:58,503 --> 00:34:00,164
He has done enough to deserve it

529
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:01,205
What has he done?

530
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:04,206
He has eloped with this girl
from the village

531
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:05,031
That's right!

532
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:08,938
Yes, yes, yes

533
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,411
Please do not be angry, brother-in-law

534
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:15,609
It was I who insisted on eloping

535
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:19,956
Because my folks were forcing me
to marry someone else

536
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:21,455
And I told them quite plainly

537
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:25,221
If I marry it will be him,
or I will kill myself

538
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:28,193
Oh, what is this, brother,
you have made my bride cry!

539
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,325
You have done well, Aunty
Done well?

540
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:33,766
Had they sent for me I'd have talked to
her parents and fixed up everything

541
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:36,236
Well, it is not too late now
Why don't you go and talk now?

542
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:39,065
Yes, Dad. Let's go immediately to
Aunty's house,

543
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:42,735
talk to her parents and arrange for a
grand wedding

544
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:46,441
Come on Daddy, hurry up
How can I, I'm so busy here

545
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:48,949
And then, what about your patients?

546
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,351
All appointments cancelled for Uncle

547
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:54,253
I will tell my secretary not to let
anyone know my whereabouts

548
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:55,653
What do you think of that Uncle?

549
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:57,556
Absolutely first rate

550
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:04,932
Hello, this is Bunnu speaking,
can I talk to Dr. Neha?

551
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,331
She. . . just a minute

552
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:10,831
Hello, I am Raj Kumar. Could you kindly
put me through to Madam

553
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:12,908
Madam has gone out

554
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:16,912
Gone out. . . not with that Bunnu, has she?

555
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:22,315
Bunnu? No, even he is asking about her
on the other line

556
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:25,349
Fine, fine, when will she be back?

557
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:28,754
May be 1 5 days or even a month from now

558
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:31,861
A month? But what if something
happens to me in the meantime?

559
00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:35,328
Please give me her phone number

560
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:39,329
I am sorry I cannot do that because
she has forbidden it

561
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,661
If you cannot give the number,
give me her address

562
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:46,640
Sorry, I cannot give her address either

563
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:57,153
I am inspector Bansi Rao from Haryana
The doctor is out, isn't she?

564
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:58,778
I must have her address immediately

565
00:35:58,956 --> 00:35:59,854
Why, what is the matter?

566
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:02,992
The law is in danger, sister
The Commissioner has gone crazy

567
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:06,288
He lets criminals go free,
and goes about locking the police

568
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,795
With great difficulty I have managed to
escape with my life

569
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:11,367
Please give me her address at once,
we need to go to her

570
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:17,302
There are many other doctors
in this town, take one of them

571
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:20,941
Sir, the Commissioner has already
shot dead two doctors,

572
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:23,012
that is why we have come here
Forget the doctor,

573
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:26,012
this girl over here who has been so long
with the doctor

574
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,209
She must have become
half a doctor by now

575
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,343
Why don't we take her along?
No, no

576
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:33,012
Listen skinny girl,
don't mess with the Police

577
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:37,321
Sir is being very nice to you and
you are taking advantage of it

578
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,428
He may be smiling, but has a foul temper

579
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:41,225
Just the other day he broke one of
my teeth in a fit of anger

580
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:43,324
Now you don't break my heart, come along

581
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:46,228
Look, I'm not even a quarter of a doctor

582
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:51,239
I will do one thing, I'll give you
the doctor's address. You may take her

583
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:54,976
One of the nurses too Yeah, sure

584
00:36:57,949 --> 00:37:00,383
Here, all the best

585
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:06,019
Let's go, sir, she is a good nurse

586
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:24,900
I am Tavde, P. C. M.,
Police Commissioner of Mumbai

587
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:26,407
Commissioner! That's right

588
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:29,206
Where is your doctor?
She is not here

589
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:31,242
Where has she gone?
She has gone out of town

590
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:33,914
How can she just go away?
She had a patient called Bunnu,

591
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:36,349
he committed suicide Suicide!

592
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:38,416
And she becomes responsible

593
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:40,615
She can be prosecuted under the T.A. D.A.

594
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:42,258
M.A. D. A? T.A. D. A,

595
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,916
Yes, it is a very big punishment

596
00:37:44,128 --> 00:37:46,358
Oh dear! No, don't do that,
I'll give you her address

597
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,623
Although I know she is innocent,
Right

598
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:49,822
. . .and sweet, Right

599
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:52,332

But what can I do, I've to call her in
for interrogation

601
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,130
Here it is

602
00:37:57,475 --> 00:38:00,273
Oh ! I'm ok, I'm fine, I'm feeling better

603
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:03,480

We have managed, we go straight to

00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:08,308
and right over to her,
nothing to worry about

606
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:12,183
Who was it?

607
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:16,324
C. S Police, oh my god !

608
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,288
Salute the big officer

609
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:24,024
Hey, he has buck teeth, salute him

00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:33,904
Sir, you have not recognized me, Sir

614
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:36,741
Remember, I saluted you during the
Republic Day Parade

615
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:39,212
What place are you talking about,
Bombay or New Delhi?

616
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,341
The Juhu Beach parade in Bombay, Sir

617
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:43,710
Oh I see, well what brings you here?

618
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:47,449
Few days back 25 million were stolen
at the Amirpur railway station

619
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,422
Those thieves are roaming around
in Bombay

620
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:51,322
I have come here in connection with
that enquiry

621
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:53,193
Right, do catch them. All the best

622
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,027

Oh ! I'm okay, I'm alright,

626
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:11,114
Ms Neha, I'll come rushing over

627
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:17,176
With your address in hand and
love in my heart

628
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:20,289
With a song on my lips, I am coming Neha

629
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:12,752
Raja, she is coming

630
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:18,724
Gafoor, will this location be good
for the hotel or on top of this hill?

631
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:20,460
Which, that. . . let me have a look

632
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,635
Has the car stopped? Yes, it has

633
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:24,569
Raj !

634
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:26,471
Is she getting down? Yes, she is

635
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:30,272
Mr. Raj Kumar Hello, Ms Neha

636
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:32,244
What are you doing here?

637
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:34,744
Followed you all the way here
What?

638
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:39,284
I mean, I am not so lucky as to be
allowed your company otherwise,

639
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:43,457
All I have in my life is work
I have come here on business

640
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:45,185
On business?

641
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,455
Yes, you see that hill over there?

642
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:52,091
I have purchased all the land
on the other side of this hill

643
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:54,499
I am going to make
a five star hotel there

644
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,897
But behind this hill is just a river!

645
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:01,511
I bought the land along with the river

646
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:03,112
All Five Star hotels have swimming pools

647
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:06,842
I will have an original swimming pool
in this hotel, isn't it Gafoor?

648
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:09,947
Great idea, Wow

649
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,111
But what brings you here?

650
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:14,349
I've come to attend my Uncle's marriage

651
00:43:14,525 --> 00:43:15,753
Wow!

652
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:17,653
Just a minute,

653
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:19,920
For Gafoor did you do all the tests
I referred?

654
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:20,755
Yes, I did

655
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:22,830
Today he didn't even address me as
sister-in-law

656
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:24,830
But he is absolutely okay now,
how can he say that

657
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:28,370
Gafoor, you seem to be much better now

658
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:33,335
Once brother gets married, I will be
absolutely fine, sister-in-law

659
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:36,071
Of course, your brother will get married

660
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,371
By the way, where are you staying?

661
00:43:38,749 --> 00:43:42,048
At the Greenery Hotel, and the tea
there is also very good

662
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:45,153
Well, tea at my place is also not bad

663
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:49,382
Will it not be better that you have tea
at our place today?

664
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,194
You can meet my father and uncle too

665
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:57,863
Mr. Raja, you dress up like town people,

666
00:43:58,002 --> 00:44:00,937
But you look like one of us,
people of the land

667
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,330
This, Nandu, is called simplicity

668
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:06,442
What business do you do in America?

669
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:09,306
You have asked me
a very difficult question

670
00:44:09,446 --> 00:44:10,242
Meaning?

671
00:44:10,614 --> 00:44:14,243
Meaning that it would be easier
to list businesses that I don't do

672
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:18,047
For instance, this tea that I'm drinking
we do not make it

673
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:21,318
This matchbox, we do not make it

674
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:25,221
With God's grace we have almost
every kind of business

675
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,025
So what must be your turnover?

676
00:44:28,232 --> 00:44:32,066
He has never turned over to see
what his turnover is

677
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:34,063
Then why don't you go public?

678
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:37,366
Public! The public is with us, right?
Absolutely

679
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:41,040
For this new hotel that you intend
to have here,

680
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:44,875
why don't you give the construction
contract to my brother's company?

681
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:47,381
No, no, this contract has been
given to Mr. Ambani. . .

682
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:48,643
Never mind, Gafoor

683
00:44:48,786 --> 00:44:54,088
These are now our own people. I will
think it over and will let you know

684
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:55,156
Thank you

685
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:56,190
Madam, your phone

686
00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:59,055
Have a sandwich
The butter is from our own dairy

687
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,195
Yes, Suzy?

688
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:03,199
Madam, you know that patient of yours,
that Baby

689
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,698
Baby?
Yes, the one with the Baby Steps

690
00:45:05,836 --> 00:45:06,996
You mean Bunnu

691
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:08,695
Yes, yes, the same

692
00:45:08,939 --> 00:45:10,406
What happened to him?

693
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:12,300
Bunnu !

694
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:15,403
What! Oh, my God

695
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:16,636
What is the matter, dear?

696
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:21,348
Oh, no! I had a patient, Bunnu
He has committed suicide

697
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:22,549
Oh, good lord !

698
00:45:22,953 --> 00:45:28,619
I am feeling very bad
I feel responsible for his death

699
00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:30,124
Ms Neha I. . .

700
00:45:30,327 --> 00:45:32,454
Please don't hold yourself responsible

701
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:35,632
We are all in the hands of destiny

702
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:39,030
But, Raj. . .
Put it out of your mind

703
00:45:39,336 --> 00:45:42,772
Those who cross over to the other side
never return

704
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:49,274
Here is your stop, friend
Hey, here is your stop, get off

705
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,344
I'm fine, I'm feeling better, thank you

706
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:57,050
I love you all, kids,
thank you for the company

707
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:59,688
I love you all, bye

708
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:02,322
Bye, see you

709
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:08,994
Help

710
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,692
Where is this voice coming from?

711
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:13,301
Sounds like it's from that valley
down there. Come let's see

712
00:46:13,637 --> 00:46:14,604
Forget it, man Come on

713
00:46:14,738 --> 00:46:16,831
Hey, Gafoor, where are you taking me?

714
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,701
Mummy!

715
00:46:20,244 --> 00:46:21,802
Easy, Gafoor, don't be hasty

716
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:24,607
Oh, good sir, please help me
Please save me

717
00:46:24,815 --> 00:46:28,216
How did you manage to get there?

718
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:30,320
I'm not hanging here of my own free will

719
00:46:30,654 --> 00:46:34,715
Some swines who eat bananas and then
throw the peel on the ground

720
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:38,316
and people like me suffer like this
Help

721
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:41,120
Okay, okay, one minute, just a minute

722
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:45,167
Here I am giving you my hand,
take hold of it and come up

723
00:46:45,335 --> 00:46:47,530
If my hand could reach that high,
do you think I would not have come out

724
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:50,139
All right, do one thing,
you come slightly lower

725
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:53,266
Look if you don't give me your hand
how will I pull you out

726
00:46:53,443 --> 00:46:56,139
Just lower your tie, I will take
hold of it and come out

727
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,373
Give my tie? Do you want to strangle me?

728
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:00,580
No, No He appears mad

729
00:47:00,784 --> 00:47:03,719
He is wasting my time, I am going
Save me, save me, friends

730
00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:05,184
Hey, please listen. Hey, Raja you too,

731
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:08,086
I will save you in two minutes,
just watch

732
00:47:09,426 --> 00:47:11,018
Yes, save me, please save me

733
00:47:11,228 --> 00:47:12,286
Yes, here I am

734
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,623
You just hold tight there. Don't let go

735
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:17,323
Come a little lower,
a little more please

736
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:19,134
A little more

737
00:47:20,237 --> 00:47:22,432
Stretch out your hand. . .

738
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:29,240
A weighty man has taken on more weight,
just see

739
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:31,444
What have you done now!

740
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:34,707
Mummy

741
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:36,818
Hey Gafoor

742
00:47:37,921 --> 00:47:41,357
Gafoor, hey Gafoor, how did you manage
to go there?

743
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,652
I had warned you not to get tangled up
in anything

744
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:47,763
Save him and save me or else
this Gafoor will go off

745
00:47:47,931 --> 00:47:51,924
Hey, don't talk that way about my friend
I'll just be back

746
00:47:52,135 --> 00:47:56,765
Tell your friend to hurry or my trousers
will become damp and you will slip

747
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:58,464
Hey, don't you do that

748
00:47:59,776 --> 00:48:04,679
Hey hurry up, Raja or Vaja
whoever you are, hurry up

749
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:11,782
Don't let go, be brave

750
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:17,123
Carefully

751
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,935
Thank you Mr. Raja, I'm okay, I'm fine

752
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:37,410
Thank you, sir

753
00:48:40,117 --> 00:48:42,210
No problem. It's all right

754
00:48:42,352 --> 00:48:44,820
I'm feeling better. Oh, mummy!

755
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:47,253
Yeah okay, it's pure gold !

756
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:49,520
Oh, no!

757
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:56,656
Friend, where is the Wooden Bridge?

758
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:59,131
Wooden bridge? We are also going
that way, come with us

759
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:00,566
How sweet! Come along

760
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:04,104
Hey friend you appear to be
very good people to me

761
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:07,573
You saved my life and are now taking me
to my destination too

762
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:10,804
It's no big thing,
we were going there ourselves

763
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:13,108
Where about the Wooden Bridge
do you have to go?

764
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:15,376
There is a place called Swapna Road
near it, that is where I have to go

765
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,383
On Swapna Road? Yes

766
00:49:16,586 --> 00:49:19,578
Strange! We are also going there

767
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:21,418
But where on Swapna Road
do you have to go?

768
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:23,684
To the bungalow named Swapna Lok

769
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:27,193
Hey we are also going there

770
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:31,497
And I am sure you are going to meet
Mr. Sharma over there

771
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,398
No, I have no business with Mr. Sharma

772
00:49:33,603 --> 00:49:35,537
I am going there to meet his daughter,
Doctor Neha

773
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:37,833
Because I am not well, you see

774
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:39,639
Here we are, we have arrived

775
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:43,611
How sweet! I wasn't afraid on the bike
because of your company

776
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:46,214
Please stop Okay

777
00:49:47,217 --> 00:49:50,152
Thank you very much
So this is the house

778
00:49:52,356 --> 00:49:54,221
Bunnu ! Ms Neha

779
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:57,256
Ms Neha

780
00:50:01,031 --> 00:50:04,023
Bunnu, how glad I'm to see you alive!

781
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:05,926
Bunnu?!

782
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:14,435
Thank God you are alive

783
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:17,679
I am so happy

784
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:21,647
I am so very happy to see you. A great
burden has been lifted off my heart

785
00:50:21,785 --> 00:50:24,276
I'm okay, I'm fine, I'm feeling better

786
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:29,651
Raja, why are you standing outside,
come in, come in

787
00:50:32,996 --> 00:50:34,896
You know, Raja, this is Bunnu

788
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:36,555
Oh Ms Neha, it is him
that I have come with

789
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:39,065
He is an angel, he saved my life

790
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:41,067
But for him, I would not be here now

791
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:44,001
Oh don't mention it, it was my duty

792
00:50:44,808 --> 00:50:50,974
But you didn't tell me
your name is Bunnu !

793
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:54,675
Please come, we will have tea together

794
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:55,817
Yeah, sure

795
00:50:55,986 --> 00:50:58,784
Tell me, Bunnu, who spread the rumour
about your death?

796
00:50:58,922 --> 00:51:01,447
What can I tell you Ms Neha, you
came away leaving me alone over there

797
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:03,217
And I started feeling unwell after that

798
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:05,054
Please come Raja
Why don't you all sit down

799
00:51:05,262 --> 00:51:10,199
When I asked your secretary for your
address she refused point blank

800
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:14,636
So I impersonated the Commissioner of
Police and went to your dispensary

801
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:16,771
And you know what happened?

802
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:20,034
Another imposter turned up there as
an Inspector! At first I was scared

803
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:22,643
But then I saw that he was equally
scared of me

804
00:51:22,846 --> 00:51:24,541
We were both a little scared of
each other

805
00:51:24,681 --> 00:51:26,672
He looked like a black-marketeer to me

806
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:30,251
And the constable accompanying him
looked like a thief

807
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:31,648
Oh my, your trousers are all wet!

808
00:51:31,855 --> 00:51:33,379
Please clean this up here

809
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:36,248
And open up the guest room,
Mr. Bunnu will stay here

810
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:39,858
Bunnu staying here!
Come, I'll show you to your room

811
00:51:40,063 --> 00:51:41,291
Thank you very much

812
00:51:41,465 --> 00:51:42,557
Okay then

813
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:44,660
See you then. . . oh no, not you !

814
00:51:45,368 --> 00:51:46,960
All right, I will join you soon

815
00:51:48,071 --> 00:51:50,266
Raja, how did you manage to make
this mistake

816
00:51:50,474 --> 00:51:52,965
You brought along the very guy
who should have been dead

817
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,078
All this happened because of you

818
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:58,975
Had you not been hanging there, I would
have left this Bunnu and come away

819
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,242
Yes, lay this also at my door

820
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:03,250
Instead of dropping him,
I dropped tea, tea !

821
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:47,287
Oh Mummy, Mummy

822
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:49,462
Oh Daddy, Daddy

823
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,368
Oh Mummy Daddy,

824
00:52:52,602 --> 00:52:54,695
Do get ready

825
00:52:55,405 --> 00:52:59,307
The girl I'm destined to marry

826
00:53:04,147 --> 00:53:08,948
I have found the girl I want to marry

827
00:57:57,874 --> 00:57:58,431
Hello

828
00:57:58,641 --> 00:57:59,630
Hi, Pa

829
00:57:59,843 --> 00:58:02,368
Hey you dope, you donkey,
my darling child

830
00:58:02,512 --> 00:58:04,173
Is it Bunnu, my Bunnu is calling

831
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:06,177
Yes, it is that fool's phone call

832
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:07,681
Give it to me, please give

833
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:12,481
What sweet words you are using for
your son, dope, donkey

834
00:58:12,622 --> 00:58:15,420
Did I phone you to hear all this?

835
00:58:15,592 --> 00:58:18,186
I thought you would be worried, Pa

836
00:58:18,528 --> 00:58:22,692
I diot, did you not believe
we would be worried?

837
00:58:22,899 --> 00:58:24,196
Let me talk to him

838
00:58:24,534 --> 00:58:26,695
Your mother is crying
her eyes out for you

839
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:28,394
Let me talk to him

840
00:58:28,805 --> 00:58:34,334
Hello my Bunnu, how are you and
where are you calling from

841
00:58:34,711 --> 00:58:38,203
Ma I am find and tell Pa that I have
arrived at the correct place

842
00:58:38,414 --> 00:58:44,216
I will be back soon and not alone,
but with your daughter-in-law

843
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,352
Daughter-in-law!

844
00:58:46,723 --> 00:58:48,315
I will tell you everything Ma
when I come there

845
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:50,551
The girl's name and the address of
this place too

846
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:51,920
But right now I am very busy

847
00:58:52,128 --> 00:58:54,619
I have to go for lunch with her now,
and to a disco in the evening

848
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:55,763
Bye, Ma

849
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:58,425
Give my love to Pa

850
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:00,297
Oh he put down the phone

851
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:01,762
Happy now, are you at ease?

852
00:59:01,905 --> 00:59:04,066
Did I not say, nothing will happen to
our child

853
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:06,266
Fool, he had us so worried !

854
00:59:06,776 --> 00:59:09,904
Had he not called I'd have given him
a sound thrashing

855
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:11,205
Are you crying?

856
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:14,282
He had me so worried, the damned fool

857
00:59:14,617 --> 00:59:15,515
What could I do?

858
00:59:15,685 --> 00:59:19,883
If I too had started crying,
who would have comforted you?

859
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:22,981
I am fine now, I'm not crying

860
00:59:34,304 --> 00:59:38,206
Raja, have you ever seen
a Beauty and an ape?

861
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:41,635
Gafoor, nowadays it's the phase of
the apes

862
00:59:41,811 --> 00:59:43,506
You are right man

863
00:59:53,156 --> 00:59:56,125
Come on boys. One, two, three

864
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:00,229
Wow! Hey, gorgeous

865
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:02,320
What are you doing?

866
01:00:03,132 --> 01:00:05,066
Friend, what are you doing?

867
01:00:05,234 --> 01:00:07,429
Don't come in between
Hey, lay off man

868
01:00:08,137 --> 01:00:10,264
What are you doing? Let me dance man

869
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:13,433
Get on the side

870
01:00:14,344 --> 01:00:16,471
Hey, baby, c'mon let's dance

871
01:00:19,048 --> 01:00:21,949
The swines are bothering our Neha

872
01:00:22,085 --> 01:00:23,677
Yes, so they are
I will murder those bastards

873
01:00:23,853 --> 01:00:26,048
Hey, listen to me, come here

874
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:30,256
You sit over here, or you will have the
police on our back

875
01:00:30,393 --> 01:00:32,953
Don't get into trouble, lie low

876
01:00:35,898 --> 01:00:37,092
Who was that!

877
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,695
Hey you, shove off

878
01:00:39,602 --> 01:00:40,500
Scoot!

879
01:00:41,671 --> 01:00:43,764
Please. . . stay away from me

880
01:00:47,377 --> 01:00:49,811
Think about your reputation
Leave me alone, Gafoor

881
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:51,970
You just come with me, my good fellow

882
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:55,416
What are you doing, man?
Don't think I have no friends

883
01:00:55,585 --> 01:00:57,678
Mr. Raja is with me

884
01:00:59,689 --> 01:01:00,451
Who is this Raja?

885
01:01:00,623 --> 01:01:03,148
He has gone to the lavatory
So don't start gloating

886
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:04,623
When he comes he will thrash you

887
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:06,192
Where has Mr. Raja disappeared to?
Who knows?

888
01:01:06,229 --> 01:01:08,925
What sort of friend is he, he saw some
goons and disappeared like a coward

889
01:01:09,132 --> 01:01:10,326
This is highly irregular

890
01:01:10,366 --> 01:01:13,460
What shall we do now?
Let us go to the restaurant and eat

891
01:01:13,636 --> 01:01:15,035
Mr. Raja, Mr. Raja

892
01:01:15,238 --> 01:01:18,230
Hey, don't misbehave man,
don't misbehave

893
01:01:18,441 --> 01:01:22,377
I will shoot you. I am with a girl
in this disco or else. . .

894
01:01:25,048 --> 01:01:28,074
Come on, Bunnu. Let's make a move

895
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:29,377
Raja

896
01:01:35,058 --> 01:01:37,959
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry

897
01:03:38,381 --> 01:03:41,282
Just tell me, friend,
why did you beat me up?

898
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:45,553
So that you never again insist on
dancing with a girl

899
01:03:45,688 --> 01:03:48,248
What are you talking about a girl,
I will not even dance with myself

900
01:03:48,391 --> 01:03:50,359
But what is your connection with her?

901
01:03:50,693 --> 01:03:51,785
Hey, had he not had
a connection with her,

902
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:53,484
why would he have thrashed you
like a dog

903
01:03:53,696 --> 01:03:55,061
Go on, get lost

904
01:03:55,565 --> 01:03:56,589
I will never dance again

905
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:58,357
See what I mean, Raja. . .

906
01:03:58,701 --> 01:04:01,033
The difference between a fight
in a western toilet and a Indian one

907
01:04:01,204 --> 01:04:02,933
Very different indeed !

908
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:06,606
Hey, why are you beating me,
Is it wrong to give someone an idea?

909
01:04:09,946 --> 01:04:11,311
Greetings, sister

910
01:04:11,447 --> 01:04:15,315
Excuse me, but I don't recognize you. . .
Who are you people?

911
01:04:15,651 --> 01:04:19,212
It is not your fault,
even our folks don't recognize us

912
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:22,449
We are the ones who bothered you
in the disco

913
01:04:22,925 --> 01:04:24,620
Oh, so it is you !

914
01:04:24,827 --> 01:04:28,058
Yes, we did not know that your companion
was going to bring us to this state

915
01:04:28,264 --> 01:04:30,664
Companion, what companion?

916
01:04:31,567 --> 01:04:33,432
The one to whom this locket belongs

917
01:04:33,636 --> 01:04:35,035
Here, take it

918
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:38,028
Bunnu !

919
01:04:38,174 --> 01:04:39,471
Here, have some tea

920
01:04:39,642 --> 01:04:41,837
How did you hurt your hand?

921
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:44,035
Oh, just like that, Bunnu

922
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:47,479
Last night I thrashed some goons
very soundly

923
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:50,175
You thrashed? No, no,
I do not believe it

924
01:04:50,353 --> 01:04:52,480
You are such a well-mannered person

925
01:04:52,655 --> 01:04:56,853
Last night I saw how you slunk off
when those goons came to the disco

926
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:59,357
But in the toilet. . .
But you couldn't resist yourself, Bunnu

927
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:01,223
And you bashed up those four, isn't it?

928
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:03,125
Which four are you talking about?

929
01:05:03,332 --> 01:05:04,697
There is no need to pretend now

930
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:07,802
They were here and they
told me everything

931
01:05:07,937 --> 01:05:11,805
What did they tell you,
that Bunnu has thrashed them?

932
01:05:12,008 --> 01:05:13,839
What else? Look at this

933
01:05:14,043 --> 01:05:16,705
Bunnu dropped his chain during the fight

934
01:05:16,846 --> 01:05:18,404
And they came to return it

935
01:05:19,215 --> 01:05:21,547
Oh, my chain, at last it has been found !

936
01:05:21,717 --> 01:05:24,618
I n the disco you were looking
very scared

937
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,847
Not just looking, I really was scared

938
01:05:27,023 --> 01:05:31,551
Then were you not scared to beat them up
in the bathroom?

939
01:05:32,228 --> 01:05:35,356
Oh that. . . anger, anger Ms Neha

940
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:38,264
You probably don't know
what a foul temper I have

941
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:41,130
Once I become angry,
I am capable of doing anything

942
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:42,862
I begin to use by fists

943
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:46,031
And they dared to bother you
in my presence

944
01:05:46,242 --> 01:05:50,372
I could not take it Ms Neha
I bashed them all up

945
01:05:50,646 --> 01:05:53,774
Bunnu, I have not been able to
understand you till now

946
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,248
Every day I see a new facet
of your personality

947
01:05:56,452 --> 01:05:59,478
Oh, this is nothing, Ms Neha
I can do anything for you

948
01:05:59,655 --> 01:06:02,180
I can even murder someone

949
01:06:06,595 --> 01:06:11,294
Because of you I did not beat
those people in front of Neha

950
01:06:12,001 --> 01:06:15,437
If I had beaten those people
in front of Neha,

951
01:06:15,604 --> 01:06:20,200
then my love for her
would have been proved

952
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:23,344
You said, ''don't hit here''

953
01:06:23,612 --> 01:06:27,639
I beat them outside and that rascal
Bunnu took credit for it

954
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:31,514
Why did you not tell Neha plainly that
you had beaten those goons?

955
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:34,248
Neha would have come to know the truth
about that idiot

956
01:06:35,124 --> 01:06:38,184
And at the same time it would have been
proved that I was a thief

957
01:06:38,227 --> 01:06:40,821
I had stolen Bunnu's chain

958
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:45,833
That bastard also did not explain
that it was not,

959
01:06:46,435 --> 01:06:48,960
he who had thrashed those people

960
01:06:49,138 --> 01:06:55,976
I stead he said, '' Ms Neha, I became
angry and so I beat up those people''

961
01:06:56,679 --> 01:07:02,481
I doubt that bastard has so much as
killed a mosquito ever

962
01:07:02,618 --> 01:07:05,280
He pretends to be mad and enjoys the
fruits of our labour

963
01:07:05,421 --> 01:07:09,016
I was itching to get my hands
around his miserable throat

964
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:10,590
That was very wrong of you, Bunnu

965
01:07:10,726 --> 01:07:12,284
Has he ever done anything right?

966
01:07:12,328 --> 01:07:16,731
Ever since he has come,
he has stuck like a tail to Neha

967
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:21,602
I don't even get a chance
to declare my love

968
01:07:22,304 --> 01:07:24,238
Forget him. . .

969
01:07:25,007 --> 01:07:27,635
have you ever done anything right?

970
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:30,301
You have been giving me wrong advice
till today

971
01:07:30,446 --> 01:07:33,643
''Raja, don't rush things,

972
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:37,945
don't rush things, first put your
friendship on a firm base''

973
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:44,151
And so I am left as just a
good friend of Neha's

974
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:50,825
Whenever I take your advice
I come to grief

975
01:07:59,442 --> 01:08:01,171
Bunnu

976
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:09,277
Bunnu, what do you want?

977
01:08:10,186 --> 01:08:13,280
Why the devil are you after me?

978
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:17,188
Why do you come between me
and my happiness?

979
01:08:17,393 --> 01:08:19,293
Here hold this glass,
hold this cigarette

980
01:08:19,728 --> 01:08:24,995
You bastard, because of you I cannot get
close to Neha

981
01:08:25,534 --> 01:08:29,231
Today I will send you far, very far,

982
01:08:30,239 --> 01:08:33,504
Send you up, up

983
01:08:39,215 --> 01:08:42,616
Now if this swine Bunnu does not die,
then Raja will

984
01:08:42,818 --> 01:08:45,753
And if both live,
then some day I will die

985
01:08:46,155 --> 01:08:48,817
Now one of the two will have to die

986
01:08:49,024 --> 01:08:51,254
So why not Bunnu

987
01:08:55,331 --> 01:08:58,664
Hey hold tight, hold quick

988
01:08:59,235 --> 01:09:00,361
Bunnu !

989
01:09:00,769 --> 01:09:03,602
Catch, catch, catch, don't let go,
catch quick

990
01:09:03,772 --> 01:09:06,707
Bunnu, you are gone today

991
01:09:07,576 --> 01:09:10,977
Hey check the wiring connections
once again

992
01:09:12,381 --> 01:09:16,613
Come fishy, fishy,
get into Bunnu's belly

993
01:09:16,785 --> 01:09:19,015
Come, come, come on

994
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:22,389
Come on, hurry up

995
01:09:22,525 --> 01:09:23,719
Excuse me, Sir Yes?

996
01:09:23,893 --> 01:09:24,985
What is happening here?

997
01:09:25,194 --> 01:09:27,321
This is a liquor still,
we are going to blast it

998
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:29,020
Have you put a bomb in it? Yes

999
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:32,190
Will it go off? No, no

1000
01:09:32,234 --> 01:09:34,794
No? Yes, it will go off

1001
01:09:34,937 --> 01:09:36,734
You are joking, are you not?

1002
01:09:37,573 --> 01:09:40,337
Come on man, come on

1003
01:09:43,112 --> 01:09:44,136
Hey brother Gafoor!

1004
01:09:44,313 --> 01:09:45,302
Greetings

1005
01:09:45,447 --> 01:09:46,414
Greetings to you also

1006
01:09:46,549 --> 01:09:47,709
Come sit down. How are you

1007
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:50,011
What are you doing? Catching fish

1008
01:09:50,152 --> 01:09:52,211
Ms. Neha and her father are
very fond of fish

1009
01:09:52,421 --> 01:09:56,152
Very good. What if someone
comes to catch you?

1010
01:09:56,825 --> 01:09:58,258
Why would anyone want to catch me?

1011
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:01,452
Your family members are looking for you,
I think they are coming this side

1012
01:10:01,664 --> 01:10:03,427
I have come to inform you

1013
01:10:03,566 --> 01:10:07,764
Oh, my God ! They will surely
take me back with them

1014
01:10:07,937 --> 01:10:09,768
Please hide me somewhere,
around here somewhere. . .

1015
01:10:09,939 --> 01:10:12,567
No! Will you jump into the water?
Want to kill yourself?

1016
01:10:12,741 --> 01:10:13,673
Oh no, what will I do now?

1017
01:10:13,842 --> 01:10:14,831
I will do something

1018
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:17,239
See that hut over there?
Go and hide behind it

1019
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:18,471
I will tackle your folks

1020
01:10:18,647 --> 01:10:20,376
Go on Thank you very much

1021
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:22,574
May God bless you

1022
01:10:26,455 --> 01:10:29,447
He is a good man, very good man !

1023
01:10:32,461 --> 01:10:34,952
Oh no, this place is stinking

1024
01:10:35,097 --> 01:10:36,257
Oh shit!

1025
01:10:39,268 --> 01:10:41,236
Have you checked carefully,
there is no one around, is there?

1026
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:44,467
Uncle, I have checked
There is no one around, let it go!

1027
01:10:44,607 --> 01:10:46,404
Fast, quick Yes, yes Uncle, yes

1028
01:10:46,775 --> 01:10:49,175
One. . . two. . . three!

1029
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:13,527
Raja, now no one can come between
you and Neha

1030
01:11:13,669 --> 01:11:15,364
Not even Bunnu

1031
01:11:15,537 --> 01:11:17,164
No, no

1032
01:11:17,573 --> 01:11:21,839
Gafoor, I had thought of you and Raja
as my brothers

1033
01:11:22,244 --> 01:11:26,613
But you turned out to be
number one bastards,

1034
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:29,842
and cheap manipulators

1035
01:11:31,387 --> 01:11:32,854
Now watch. . .

1036
01:11:33,055 --> 01:11:35,353
What I do to you guys. . .

1037
01:11:35,691 --> 01:11:37,249
after the interval

1038
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:51,068
One Juliet two Romeos,
two Romeos one Juliet

1039
01:11:51,273 --> 01:11:53,764
Dust devils, Blossom and the Stone,
Hard-hearted lover, Roses and thorns

1040
01:11:53,909 --> 01:11:56,207
Hey Gafoor, where the devil were you?

1041
01:11:56,412 --> 01:11:59,313
Hey, Champ., I had gone to buy
a bouquet for you

1042
01:11:59,648 --> 01:12:03,106
Flowers? To celebrate my failure?

1043
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:05,310
Chief, when you hear what I have done,

1044
01:12:05,354 --> 01:12:08,755
your face will look brighter than
these flowers

1045
01:12:08,924 --> 01:12:14,226
Stop blabbering, go to the chemist
and get me a pill

1046
01:12:14,763 --> 01:12:17,061
My head feels like
it's going to burst with pain

1047
01:12:17,232 --> 01:12:19,029
Strange are the ways of life,

1048
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:23,127
here your head is bursting
and there a bomb has burst!

1049
01:12:23,539 --> 01:12:24,733
What do you mean?

1050
01:12:24,873 --> 01:12:27,341
That thorn in your life, that Bunnu. . .

1051
01:12:27,476 --> 01:12:28,465
Finish !

1052
01:12:28,644 --> 01:12:30,635
What have you done to him?

1053
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:33,246
Why are you becoming so serious, it's
for your sake that I've done all this

1054
01:12:33,582 --> 01:12:34,344
And you killed him?

1055
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:37,986
I didn't kill him myself. Just sent him
where the bomb was placed

1056
01:12:38,153 --> 01:12:38,949
Boom ! !

1057
01:12:39,088 --> 01:12:40,385
I couldn't let the opportunity go,

1058
01:12:40,756 --> 01:12:42,246
if I had not killed him,
you would have taken it out on me

1059
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:45,256
I have an ember in my hand, an ember,
I will not lie

1060
01:12:45,594 --> 01:12:49,394
We two have done many bad things in life
but have never killed anyone

1061
01:12:49,765 --> 01:12:50,390
But you have gone and killed him !

1062
01:12:50,566 --> 01:12:54,297
He was coming between you and Neha,
I was not going to let him go

1063
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:55,762
You have made a very big mistake

1064
01:12:55,904 --> 01:12:58,270
To waste a good and an innocent guy
just like that!

1065
01:12:58,807 --> 01:13:00,297
I admit I have made a mistake

1066
01:13:00,642 --> 01:13:03,202
and I am feeling very bad about it,
I was feeling very guilty

1067
01:13:03,245 --> 01:13:07,614
What shall I do? The police is bound to
catch me some day

1068
01:13:08,016 --> 01:13:10,211
So shall I give myself up to the law?

1069
01:13:11,019 --> 01:13:13,112
Hey Police, hey police, police

1070
01:13:13,255 --> 01:13:15,815
Hey stop, stop, sit down, sit down.

1071
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:22,155
Gafoor, you love me so much, man?

1072
01:13:22,631 --> 01:13:25,225
Huh, do you love me so much?

1073
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:27,725
What you have done for me today,

1074
01:13:27,870 --> 01:13:31,033
even my own brother would not have done

1075
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:34,232
Here, have this drink, drink, drink

1076
01:13:36,044 --> 01:13:37,875
Hey. . . cheers!

1077
01:13:45,454 --> 01:13:51,086
Thousands fall in love

1078
01:13:55,798 --> 01:14:01,828
But not all are true lovers

1079
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:12,604
Love is not a thing that all can handle

1080
01:14:38,373 --> 01:14:41,433
Head or tail, head or tail

1081
01:14:42,344 --> 01:14:45,279
Love is a game of the heart

1082
01:14:52,588 --> 01:14:57,958
A game which some pass, some of us pass

1083
01:15:00,429 --> 01:15:02,397
and some do fail

1084
01:18:50,225 --> 01:18:52,352
Don't you ever talk to me again
Come on, mate

1085
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:53,820
Now what is there to feel shy about

1086
01:18:53,962 --> 01:18:55,953
What else. . . what are you doing?

1087
01:18:56,131 --> 01:18:57,359
Don't you like it?

1088
01:18:57,532 --> 01:18:58,829
No, it's not that

1089
01:18:58,967 --> 01:19:01,060
Then have some more

1090
01:19:01,470 --> 01:19:04,462
Do eat some more

1091
01:19:04,606 --> 01:19:06,073
You have made me over eat,
it is so well made

1092
01:19:06,208 --> 01:19:08,369
But please stop now Ms Neha
my stomach is full

1093
01:19:08,810 --> 01:19:11,176
Sister-in-law Brother-in-law

1094
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:12,971
Enough, please enough, stop now

1095
01:19:13,181 --> 01:19:15,206
All right. Come Raja, have lunch with us

1096
01:19:15,383 --> 01:19:17,510
No thank you. . . the sight of you. . .

1097
01:19:17,719 --> 01:19:19,186
I mean the sight of food has satiated us

1098
01:19:19,387 --> 01:19:22,322
Make him eat, he is hungry,
give him first

1099
01:19:23,325 --> 01:19:26,590
Brother Gafoor, you are a sly one
Why is that?

1100
01:19:26,728 --> 01:19:28,787
The other day you told me to hide
in the hut

1101
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:31,831
and the minute I entered,
the hut blew up

1102
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:32,898
What? Yes

1103
01:19:33,034 --> 01:19:35,332
Had that place not been stinking of
whisky and had I not left it,

1104
01:19:35,504 --> 01:19:36,937
then I, then, that. . .

1105
01:19:37,105 --> 01:19:38,037
It is like this, Bunnu. . .

1106
01:19:38,206 --> 01:19:40,003
Yes, and he told me that
my Mother and Father had also come

1107
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:41,732
when my Mother and Father had
really not come

1108
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:44,743
No, no your parents were coming,
he just did not hear right

1109
01:19:44,946 --> 01:19:46,038
Really? He heard ''Chunnu''

1110
01:19:46,248 --> 01:19:47,806
But he thought it was ''Bunnu''
so he told you

1111
01:19:48,016 --> 01:19:50,348
I then told him
That's what I thought,

1112
01:19:50,552 --> 01:19:53,612
that you are such good persons!

1113
01:19:55,257 --> 01:19:57,054
No, no, no!

1114
01:19:57,659 --> 01:20:00,457
No, no, no Bunnu, relax

1115
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:02,221
Raja, please close your lighter

1116
01:20:02,364 --> 01:20:03,524
Please, just a minute

1117
01:20:04,332 --> 01:20:05,264
What, what's the matter?

1118
01:20:05,634 --> 01:20:07,966
Perhaps you don't know that Bunnu is
afraid of three things

1119
01:20:08,136 --> 01:20:09,865
Fire, water and heights

1120
01:20:10,038 --> 01:20:13,030
When he sees fire he thinks
he will get burnt

1121
01:20:13,241 --> 01:20:15,641
When he sees water he thinks
he will drown

1122
01:20:16,278 --> 01:20:19,577
And when he is on a height he thinks
he will fall down from there

1123
01:20:19,781 --> 01:20:21,271
Oh, is that so

1124
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:28,389
From now on we will always remember
fire, water and heights

1125
01:20:30,258 --> 01:20:31,987
Come, Bunnu, look, you must not be
afraid of water

1126
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:34,253
Nothing is going to happen to you
No, no, it is not fear, Ms Neha

1127
01:20:34,396 --> 01:20:37,194
But I promise, nothing will happen
So you do not trust me?

1128
01:20:37,365 --> 01:20:40,664
No, no, how can I not trust you
Of course I trust you completely

1129
01:20:40,802 --> 01:20:44,602
But this water. . . I do not trust it
Many have drowned in it

1130
01:20:44,773 --> 01:20:46,764
Oh forget it, Bunnu

1131
01:20:46,908 --> 01:20:49,103
Ms Neha, Ms Neha

1132
01:20:49,277 --> 01:20:50,471
I don't want to hear anything

1133
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:54,171
Oh, Ms Neha. Please listen, Ms Neha

1134
01:20:57,385 --> 01:20:58,579
Bunnu, dear What?

1135
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:01,245
Oh Mr. Raj, Brother Gafoor!

1136
01:21:01,423 --> 01:21:02,515
Bunnu Yes

1137
01:21:02,657 --> 01:21:04,352
You should go into the water

1138
01:21:04,726 --> 01:21:05,158
Why?

1139
01:21:05,327 --> 01:21:07,227
Ms Neha has gone away in disgust

1140
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:08,829
I want to tell you one thing Mr. Raj

1141
01:21:08,964 --> 01:21:10,625
Whether Ms Neha goes away in disgust or
anyone else,

1142
01:21:10,832 --> 01:21:12,231
I will not get into the water

1143
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:14,028
Many experienced swimmers have drowned

1144
01:21:14,169 --> 01:21:15,067
You have a point there

1145
01:21:15,237 --> 01:21:17,728
One must never do anything
that the heart forbids

1146
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:19,966
True, and look how deep it is!
Yeah, very deep

1147
01:21:20,141 --> 01:21:22,837
My mother does not at all like my going
into the water. . .

1148
01:21:29,584 --> 01:21:31,051
Mummy Help, someone help

1149
01:21:31,186 --> 01:21:32,847
Help, help, help

1150
01:21:33,255 --> 01:21:34,882
Bunnu !

1151
01:21:35,690 --> 01:21:36,952
Ms Neha

1152
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:43,360
Help, help

1153
01:21:46,368 --> 01:21:48,700
Bunnu Thank you, Ms Neha

1154
01:21:49,204 --> 01:21:50,967
Come, come we will all swim together

1155
01:21:51,106 --> 01:21:52,664
How sweet, how sweet!

1156
01:21:53,675 --> 01:21:55,870
This swimming is a very good thing

1157
01:21:56,077 --> 01:21:57,476
But Bunnu, why did you jump in?

1158
01:21:57,612 --> 01:21:58,772
Yes, why did I jump in !

1159
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:01,107
Why did I jump. . .
actually what happened was,

1160
01:22:01,316 --> 01:22:04,217
that I thought you would be annoyed
if I did not jump in

1161
01:22:04,552 --> 01:22:07,316
And I thought that the worst that can
happen to me is I'd lose my life

1162
01:22:07,656 --> 01:22:09,351
I can even sacrifice my life for Ms Neha

1163
01:22:09,724 --> 01:22:11,316
Oh, Bunnu, you are so sweet

1164
01:22:11,459 --> 01:22:12,221
Thank you

1165
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:14,726
Raja, you lose again

1166
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:18,822
You're going through a very bad phase
Oh shut up

1167
01:22:18,967 --> 01:22:21,231
Your luck is so bad that this. . .

1168
01:22:27,075 --> 01:22:28,633
Get up, get up

1169
01:22:29,077 --> 01:22:31,545
Over there I'm so worried about you,

1170
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:35,245
my head is about to explode with pain
and you're sitting here drinking beer!

1171
01:22:35,383 --> 01:22:36,975
You don't care about me now?

1172
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:40,649
It was merely a coconut, not a bomb
that burst on your head

1173
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:44,384
You had placed a bomb, a bomb indeed. . .
Did that wretch Bunnu die?

1174
01:22:44,559 --> 01:22:46,959
You keep giving me wrong ideas

1175
01:22:47,095 --> 01:22:50,087
and are now sitting here
enjoying yourself, having a good time

1176
01:22:50,699 --> 01:22:55,864
Look, Raja, half the money we stole
is mine

1177
01:22:56,871 --> 01:23:01,433
You spend thousands on that girl
I just have a beer and it pinches you

1178
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:05,309
Who is having a good time, me or you?

1179
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:09,605
I am having a good time?

1180
01:23:10,352 --> 01:23:14,311
Look, Gafoor, Neha is no ordinary girl

1181
01:23:15,423 --> 01:23:18,415
I love Neha, I love her

1182
01:23:21,262 --> 01:23:25,164
I have spent my whole life
on a railway platform,

1183
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:27,233
. . .have been black-marketing tickets

1184
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:32,231
I never knew what beauty is,
what love is!

1185
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:37,072
But ever since I saw Neha. . .

1186
01:23:38,179 --> 01:23:42,047
I have known that she is the one
I have been waiting for

1187
01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:45,747
I. . . I love Neha very much

1188
01:23:46,254 --> 01:23:49,781
If I cannot have her. . .

1189
01:23:50,191 --> 01:23:52,091
I. . . I will die

1190
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:54,592
No, no, no!

1191
01:23:55,363 --> 01:23:58,389
Don't cry, don't cry

1192
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,991
Come, come, hey Raja

1193
01:24:01,136 --> 01:24:02,899
Gafoor, Gafoor!

1194
01:24:04,839 --> 01:24:08,935
I know my ideas keep failing every time

1195
01:24:09,511 --> 01:24:11,502
But this time, Raja

1196
01:24:12,247 --> 01:24:15,410
If I don't fix that Bunnu
for good this time,

1197
01:24:15,817 --> 01:24:18,217
I will change my name

1198
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:22,320
Neha will be my sister-in-law
She will be yours, she will, she will

1199
01:24:23,024 --> 01:24:26,152
BUNNU NEHA

1200
01:24:26,828 --> 01:24:33,358
Oh God, I have heard that love can melt
even a stone's heart

1201
01:24:34,235 --> 01:24:36,169
Does it really do that?

1202
01:24:36,337 --> 01:24:41,274
Anyway, I will test my love today

1203
01:24:42,444 --> 01:24:44,935
Help me God

1204
01:24:46,381 --> 01:24:51,045
Oh, my dear silent friend,
listen to my tale of love

1205
01:24:55,857 --> 01:24:59,088
She is unaware of my love

1206
01:24:59,260 --> 01:25:02,024
When she comes before me
My heart goes boom, boom, boom

1207
01:25:02,197 --> 01:25:03,494
My heart breaks into bits

1208
01:25:03,631 --> 01:25:05,326
But I do not have the nerve to say

1209
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:08,999
Darling I love you

1210
01:25:24,252 --> 01:25:25,617
what is this happening darling?

1211
01:25:25,820 --> 01:25:28,311
Oh, no, no, no

1212
01:25:28,456 --> 01:25:30,014
Oh no darling

1213
01:25:30,225 --> 01:25:33,422
Hey, how did this blasted stone
get behind me instead of bursting !

1214
01:25:38,266 --> 01:25:40,131
Ms Neha?

1215
01:25:43,271 --> 01:25:44,829
Bunnu !

1216
01:25:45,173 --> 01:25:47,164
Hey how is it running after me!

1217
01:25:47,375 --> 01:25:51,038
Hey no, no, no!

1218
01:25:54,849 --> 01:25:56,339
Ms Neha

1219
01:25:56,684 --> 01:25:59,050
Oh Bunnu, what happened, what happened?

1220
01:25:59,254 --> 01:26:02,189
Ms Neha, stone. I. . . song. . . after me

1221
01:26:02,390 --> 01:26:03,584
But you were running, were you. . .

1222
01:26:03,791 --> 01:26:07,022
I was running ! Yes, I was running

1223
01:26:07,228 --> 01:26:10,322
Ms Neha, this is the first time
in my life that I have run so fast

1224
01:26:10,698 --> 01:26:13,633
I am ok, I am fine, I am feeling better

1225
01:26:13,801 --> 01:26:15,428
Ms Neha ! Oh, very good

1226
01:26:15,637 --> 01:26:16,797
Ms Neha, I am feeling better

1227
01:26:17,005 --> 01:26:19,496
Oh how sweet! Very good Bunnu

1228
01:26:25,313 --> 01:26:29,716
It is a good idea, Sir,
but made in Switzerland would be better

1229
01:26:30,151 --> 01:26:32,016
Hey, Gafoor

1230
01:26:32,153 --> 01:26:34,018
Greetings

1231
01:26:34,222 --> 01:26:36,247
Greetings to you too

1232
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:39,349
What is the matter Brother Gafoor,
Mr. Raja has not come?

1233
01:26:39,727 --> 01:26:42,321
He. . . Raja ! Ms Neha,
I want to tell you something

1234
01:26:42,664 --> 01:26:43,756
But have you had something to eat?

1235
01:26:43,932 --> 01:26:45,263
I am eating, I will eat

1236
01:26:45,433 --> 01:26:48,630
Why don't you drink something
Yes I will. Thank you

1237
01:26:48,836 --> 01:26:49,666
What is the matter?

1238
01:26:49,837 --> 01:26:51,236
I want to talk to you in private

1239
01:26:51,372 --> 01:26:53,966
Ms Neha, please go and talk to him first.

1240
01:26:54,142 --> 01:26:55,837
Yes, go baby go

1241
01:26:55,977 --> 01:26:57,740
See that he eats well

1242
01:26:57,946 --> 01:27:00,039
And drinks well too

1243
01:27:00,515 --> 01:27:03,109
And so Gafoor, why hasn't Raja come

1244
01:27:03,318 --> 01:27:05,684
No problem, I suppose?
No, there is no problem

1245
01:27:05,887 --> 01:27:07,013
Is all well? All is well

1246
01:27:07,188 --> 01:27:11,181
Ms Neha, I wanted to tell you
that Raja. . .

1247
01:27:12,393 --> 01:27:13,690
Gafoor, Gafoor

1248
01:27:13,828 --> 01:27:16,797
What is the matter, what has happened?

1249
01:27:17,098 --> 01:27:18,497
Oh Gafoor, what has happened?

1250
01:27:18,633 --> 01:27:21,193
Gafoor what has happened to you?

1251
01:27:21,803 --> 01:27:24,431
Just a minute you move aside,
I will take a look at him

1252
01:27:24,606 --> 01:27:26,005
Yes, what's the matter with you, Gafoor?

1253
01:27:26,207 --> 01:27:28,402
It seems that. . .
Calm yourself first, hold this

1254
01:27:28,543 --> 01:27:31,171
Now tell me what has happened
A chicken bone got stuck in his throat

1255
01:27:31,212 --> 01:27:36,343
Oh, a chicken bone!
Gafoor, you lie down here and push hard

1256
01:27:37,051 --> 01:27:39,417
Push hard, Gafoor, push hard

1257
01:27:39,621 --> 01:27:41,316
Push hard, Gafoor!

1258
01:27:41,656 --> 01:27:43,419
Push hard from within

1259
01:27:45,426 --> 01:27:47,860
Is it coming out, it is not?

1260
01:27:48,129 --> 01:27:50,256
Brother Gafoor, push harder

1261
01:27:50,665 --> 01:27:52,030
Brother Gafoor is it coming out or not?

1262
01:27:52,233 --> 01:27:53,427
It is not coming out?

1263
01:27:53,635 --> 01:27:55,364
Brother Gafoor! ! !

1264
01:28:03,711 --> 01:28:05,201
Bunnu, you have done wonders!
Thanks

1265
01:28:05,413 --> 01:28:07,973
You have saved Gafoor's life
It was my duty, Ms Neha

1266
01:28:08,182 --> 01:28:10,173
As a child, I once had a coin stuck
in my throat

1267
01:28:10,218 --> 01:28:13,278
My mother thumped me like this
a few times and the coin came out

1268
01:28:13,621 --> 01:28:16,215
But instead of thumping me
why did you kick me?

1269
01:28:16,591 --> 01:28:17,683
Because you are a big man now, Gafoor,

1270
01:28:17,825 --> 01:28:19,793
you are a grown up man and
the bone was also big

1271
01:28:19,927 --> 01:28:21,986
Just look how big it is!
Very big, isn't it

1272
01:28:22,196 --> 01:28:23,185
Do not eat chicken

1273
01:28:23,331 --> 01:28:26,994
Eat food, eat food,
but do not eat chicken

1274
01:28:28,603 --> 01:28:30,298
Oh shit!

1275
01:28:32,206 --> 01:28:34,333
Hello? Oh, shit!

1276
01:28:34,709 --> 01:28:35,403
Hello, hello

1277
01:28:35,610 --> 01:28:37,805
Bunnu Ms Neha, you?

1278
01:28:38,212 --> 01:28:39,338
What are you doing, Bunnu?

1279
01:28:39,547 --> 01:28:41,606
Just waiting for your phone call

1280
01:28:41,816 --> 01:28:43,215
Will you come for a walk with me?

1281
01:28:43,551 --> 01:28:48,215
Walk? I will run with you
I will be over right away

1282
01:32:22,036 --> 01:32:24,266
What is it?

1283
01:32:25,139 --> 01:32:26,834
Did Bunnu come into your dream?

1284
01:32:26,974 --> 01:32:29,568
Yes, I dreamt of Bunnu

1285
01:32:30,244 --> 01:32:33,042
He has now started to scare me
even in my dreams

1286
01:32:33,247 --> 01:32:36,045
I n my dreams he has started
to sing with Neha

1287
01:32:40,354 --> 01:32:41,446
You are laughing !

1288
01:32:41,589 --> 01:32:43,250
You are laughing
Don't laugh, don't laugh

1289
01:32:43,457 --> 01:32:44,651
All this has happened because of you

1290
01:32:44,859 --> 01:32:48,852
You told me ''let friendship grow'',
''do not rush things''

1291
01:32:49,263 --> 01:32:53,859
If I had not listened to you,
Bunnu wouldn't have come between us

1292
01:32:54,068 --> 01:32:57,094
No one can stop me now, I am going
Where is my motorcycle key?

1293
01:32:57,271 --> 01:32:58,397
Where are you going?

1294
01:32:58,773 --> 01:33:00,240
I am going to tell Neha that I love her

1295
01:33:00,408 --> 01:33:02,308
Listen to me
Don't stop me, Gafoor

1296
01:33:02,443 --> 01:33:04,911
. . .or else I will kill you too

1297
01:33:05,346 --> 01:33:09,510
Today no one can come between
me and Neha

1298
01:33:09,650 --> 01:33:10,810
Goodbye

1299
01:33:12,219 --> 01:33:15,211
Listen to me Raja, please come back

1300
01:33:22,430 --> 01:33:25,228
So, you want to go to Neha, Mr. Raja?

1301
01:33:25,366 --> 01:33:29,962
Just see where this Bunnu sends you now!

1302
01:33:32,039 --> 01:33:33,768
Listen, Raja, listen

1303
01:33:33,941 --> 01:33:36,375
Raja, O Raja

1304
01:34:18,152 --> 01:34:21,212
Gafoor, how is Raja? Where is he?

1305
01:34:22,123 --> 01:34:23,215
What?! !

1306
01:34:23,357 --> 01:34:25,416
No, in Room number 2 7

1307
01:34:28,763 --> 01:34:30,458
Raja

1308
01:34:35,236 --> 01:34:38,171
Thank God you are not hurt too badly

1309
01:34:38,339 --> 01:34:40,739
Do you know the state I was in
on hearing from Gafoor

1310
01:34:40,875 --> 01:34:44,038
What bad thoughts were going through
my mind on the way to the hospital !

1311
01:34:44,245 --> 01:34:46,839
Anyway, how are you?

1312
01:34:47,248 --> 01:34:50,684
There is no need to worry so much
on my account, Ms Neha

1313
01:34:50,851 --> 01:34:54,480
Why, what is the matter?
Are you not my friend?

1314
01:34:54,655 --> 01:34:57,783
Friend, friend, friend. . .
I hate that word

1315
01:34:58,392 --> 01:35:01,293
I am no one's friend,
especially not your's

1316
01:35:01,429 --> 01:35:04,227
You. . . please don't shout and scream,
you are not well

1317
01:35:04,398 --> 01:35:07,424
What else can I do but shout and scream

1318
01:35:07,735 --> 01:35:10,431
No one knows my real trouble

1319
01:35:10,604 --> 01:35:15,303
Raja, who but me can know
what is troubling you

1320
01:35:16,343 --> 01:35:22,509
I cannot tell you how bothered I am
by this accident

1321
01:35:22,717 --> 01:35:23,706
Really!

1322
01:35:23,918 --> 01:35:26,409
Hello Raja, how are you feeling now?

1323
01:35:26,554 --> 01:35:28,215
Sir, I have recovered just this minute

1324
01:35:28,556 --> 01:35:29,614
Good, I am so glad

1325
01:35:29,824 --> 01:35:32,224
Dear, we should now leave for Bombay

1326
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:34,323
Daddy, how can we leave Raja
in this condition. . .

1327
01:35:34,462 --> 01:35:36,327
This is a very good hospital, my girl

1328
01:35:36,430 --> 01:35:40,264
Besides, he has Gafoor to look after him

1329
01:35:40,634 --> 01:35:43,831
But only you can look after
your patients

1330
01:35:44,038 --> 01:35:45,767
And they are waiting for you, right?

1331
01:35:45,940 --> 01:35:47,237
Right Right

1332
01:35:47,374 --> 01:35:50,309
Good. Alright then,
I'll wait for you downstairs

1333
01:35:50,344 --> 01:35:53,438
Say bye bye. Bye
hope you will feel better

1334
01:35:53,647 --> 01:35:54,773
Ms Neha

1335
01:35:55,149 --> 01:35:58,380
Okay Raja, I will have to go now
Look after yourself,

1336
01:35:58,552 --> 01:36:01,988
and come to Bombay as soon as
you are well. Okay bye

1337
01:36:05,192 --> 01:36:08,787
Gafoor, this accident has worked
wonders for me

1338
01:36:09,296 --> 01:36:13,494
Did you see how she held my hand in hers
and was being so friendly

1339
01:36:13,634 --> 01:36:15,397
How worried she was for me

1340
01:36:15,536 --> 01:36:18,528
My train is back on the rails, man,
she has shown a green signal

1341
01:36:18,706 --> 01:36:21,436
You have made progress but don't feel
so happy, my friend

1342
01:36:21,609 --> 01:36:25,010
Because it is said that,
''Tears lurk behind smiles''.

1343
01:36:25,212 --> 01:36:26,645
Oh, shut up, you pessimist

1344
01:36:29,216 --> 01:36:30,615
Hey, Bunnu !

1345
01:36:31,552 --> 01:36:33,213
Bunnu ! Bunnu !

1346
01:36:37,525 --> 01:36:40,460
Hi Mom, hi Dad, now I am perfect

1347
01:36:42,029 --> 01:36:44,259
I am not afraid of water any more

1348
01:36:44,632 --> 01:36:46,725
Not afraid of even getting a shock

1349
01:36:46,867 --> 01:36:51,270
Heights do not scare me now,
neither can the fear itself

1350
01:36:51,438 --> 01:36:53,235
I can laugh very well

1351
01:36:53,741 --> 01:36:55,572
I can talk very well, Hello!

1352
01:36:56,177 --> 01:36:57,337
I can sing very well

1353
01:36:57,678 --> 01:36:59,339
I can walk very well

1354
01:37:00,214 --> 01:37:02,375
I can jump very well,
I can fight very well

1355
01:37:02,583 --> 01:37:04,574
I can dance very well,
I can run very well

1356
01:37:04,785 --> 01:37:08,812
I do not need tomorrow, I'm an artiste
who can give a shot at one take,

1357
01:37:08,989 --> 01:37:10,684
Okay? Okay, guy!

1358
01:37:10,825 --> 01:37:13,293
Boom, boom, shaka laka, boom boom

1359
01:37:14,595 --> 01:37:17,496
Hey Mom, hey Dad, now I am perfect

1360
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:21,498
Boom, boom, shaka laka, boom boom

1361
01:37:42,957 --> 01:37:47,223
Now. . . everything is possible for me

1362
01:37:47,828 --> 01:37:51,924
This beautiful night,
beautiful moonlight

1363
01:38:00,474 --> 01:38:02,965
Bunnu ! Hi !

1364
01:38:03,978 --> 01:38:06,276
Hi ! everybody

1365
01:38:10,117 --> 01:38:13,518
Hi, Hi, who is winning?

1366
01:38:14,588 --> 01:38:16,317
Watch the game

1367
01:38:17,691 --> 01:38:19,386
Hi, Neha

1368
01:38:20,594 --> 01:38:22,789
Hi Hi !

1369
01:38:23,197 --> 01:38:24,596
Hi, Bunnu

1370
01:38:29,536 --> 01:38:32,528
Mr. Raj, shall I tell you something
Yes

1371
01:38:32,706 --> 01:38:35,402
You are a great actor, my friend !

1372
01:38:35,542 --> 01:38:39,808
The way you were behaving in the
hospital as if you were about to die

1373
01:38:40,014 --> 01:38:42,448
How did you get on your feet so fast?

1374
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:45,150
You are no less an actor yourself

1375
01:38:45,319 --> 01:38:47,617
You kept meeting Neha
by feigning illness

1376
01:38:47,821 --> 01:38:52,224
A true patient sees the doctor once
and keeps taking his medicine quietly

1377
01:38:52,559 --> 01:38:56,222
Whereas you meet Neha all the time
but never take any medicine at all

1378
01:38:56,730 --> 01:38:59,028
Are you also not pretending
all the time yourself?

1379
01:38:59,166 --> 01:39:03,102
You said you'd open a Five Star hotel,
but not even a food-stall is in sight!

1380
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:05,704
Yes I pretended, I did

1381
01:39:05,873 --> 01:39:08,364
Why? Because I love her

1382
01:39:08,509 --> 01:39:10,204
You love Neha?

1383
01:39:10,511 --> 01:39:14,242
One who has forsaken his country
and gone and settled in America

1384
01:39:14,281 --> 01:39:17,876
one who cannot love his own country,
how can he love poor Neha?

1385
01:39:18,319 --> 01:39:21,379
So what? Even Mahatma Gandhi had
come from South Africa. I came too

1386
01:39:21,522 --> 01:39:25,014
But he came for his country,
he loved this country

1387
01:39:25,192 --> 01:39:27,490
Hey, enough is enough

1388
01:39:27,628 --> 01:39:30,188
Hey, same applies to you

1389
01:39:31,498 --> 01:39:33,523
You dared to touch me! Mummy

1390
01:39:33,701 --> 01:39:35,032
You dared to touch me

1391
01:39:35,202 --> 01:39:38,694
Look here, Romeo, a single blow from me
will turn you to Coolie No. 1

1392
01:39:38,839 --> 01:39:44,539
You, Mr. India, I will throw acid
on your face and you'll look a Loafer

1393
01:39:44,745 --> 01:39:47,111
Do I look like a Loafer?
Do I look like a Coolie to you?

1394
01:39:47,314 --> 01:39:49,805
You will throw acid on me?
You will fix me with a blow?

1395
01:39:50,217 --> 01:39:51,241
Okay then

1396
01:39:51,452 --> 01:39:52,817
Yes I will give you a blow
It's not all that easy

1397
01:39:52,953 --> 01:39:54,147
Hey, what is going on?

1398
01:39:54,321 --> 01:39:55,447
Who the devil is it?

1399
01:39:55,622 --> 01:39:58,216
Bunnu, Raj ! Ms Neha

1400
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:02,224
Now again you'll pretend to be silly!

1401
01:40:02,563 --> 01:40:03,427
What were you two doing?

1402
01:40:03,630 --> 01:40:06,030
No, no, how did he get cured?

1403
01:40:06,166 --> 01:40:09,226
I mean I was giving him a hug
now that he has recovered

1404
01:40:09,570 --> 01:40:12,334
How are you feeling now?
I don't know what to say, Ms Neha

1405
01:40:12,673 --> 01:40:15,870
I feel his internal injuries are
not quite healed yet

1406
01:40:16,043 --> 01:40:18,204
You must rest some more

1407
01:40:18,245 --> 01:40:21,237
No, no, I am quite well now

1408
01:40:21,882 --> 01:40:27,445
It's in your own interest to remain well
you scoundrel

1409
01:40:28,055 --> 01:40:34,255
Bunnu you sly knave, it isn't Neha
but I'm going to treat you now

1410
01:40:34,461 --> 01:40:36,895
Hello, Pappu Pager speaking

1411
01:40:37,264 --> 01:40:41,394
Hey, you stop wasting time
and come to the point

1412
01:40:41,869 --> 01:40:45,999
I am your Great Uncle this side,
you rascal Bunnu

1413
01:40:47,307 --> 01:40:51,607
You two-headed goat, stop bleating about
your introduction,

1414
01:40:51,979 --> 01:40:56,416
or I will turn you into the hay
you are eating,

1415
01:40:56,884 --> 01:41:00,251
then don't go about blaming Pappu Pager

1416
01:41:00,354 --> 01:41:02,618
You get it? I will ring off now

1417
01:41:02,823 --> 01:41:06,919
Hey, where do you think you're going?
Let him come, he has an appointment

1418
01:41:07,061 --> 01:41:10,224
Come, come, come on in

1419
01:41:13,033 --> 01:41:14,261
My name is Bunnu

1420
01:41:14,435 --> 01:41:17,165
How about the one who is to be wasted?

1421
01:41:17,337 --> 01:41:18,861
No, I have brought along his photograph

1422
01:41:19,039 --> 01:41:22,031
Had you brought him along I would have
fixed him properly

1423
01:41:22,242 --> 01:41:25,234
. . .without wasting any time

1424
01:41:25,446 --> 01:41:27,209
For how much do you want me
to make it out?

1425
01:41:27,247 --> 01:41:28,179
What? Cheque

1426
01:41:28,382 --> 01:41:32,284
Listen you, I don't believe in cheques

1427
01:41:32,653 --> 01:41:35,781
You understand? It is cash,
hard cash that is wanted

1428
01:41:35,956 --> 01:41:38,447
But for cash I will have to phone my Pa

1429
01:41:38,592 --> 01:41:41,390
Phone your old man immediately then

1430
01:41:41,762 --> 01:41:44,856
Phone him
I can if you give me the phone

1431
01:41:46,967 --> 01:41:50,698
What is my home number again?
Oh, I remembered !

1432
01:41:57,478 --> 01:41:58,911
Are you Pappu Pager?

1433
01:41:59,113 --> 01:42:00,341
There Thank you

1434
01:42:02,216 --> 01:42:03,274
Pa, my Pa has come

1435
01:42:03,317 --> 01:42:05,251
A moment. What mess have you got into!

1436
01:42:05,452 --> 01:42:08,546
Stop spinning a yarn and come out
with the cash, understand

1437
01:42:08,722 --> 01:42:13,318
And get lost with this hero of yours
Go

1438
01:42:14,027 --> 01:42:15,358
Just a minute

1439
01:42:15,762 --> 01:42:18,754
What kind of trouble are you buying with
this cash? Are you mad?

1440
01:42:18,932 --> 01:42:21,332
You are worried about your money,
not your son

1441
01:42:21,668 --> 01:42:23,829
Why are you talking nonsense?

1442
01:42:23,971 --> 01:42:25,939
Pa. . . Don't talk, just go

1443
01:42:26,073 --> 01:42:29,042
Don't tangle up with this goon

1444
01:42:29,176 --> 01:42:30,973
Sure? Sure

1445
01:42:31,778 --> 01:42:32,836
Okay

1446
01:42:33,947 --> 01:42:36,677
Okay friend, I am taking back
this photograph

1447
01:42:36,850 --> 01:42:37,646
What for?

1448
01:42:37,784 --> 01:42:41,049
Because my Pa says not to tangle
with a goon

1449
01:42:41,255 --> 01:42:44,486
If he is roused, he will not only
smash me up but all others too

1450
01:42:44,658 --> 01:42:45,647
Mummy

1451
01:42:45,792 --> 01:42:47,054
Hey, listen Shut up

1452
01:42:47,261 --> 01:42:50,287
What did you say, you asshole?

1453
01:42:50,797 --> 01:42:54,096
What did you tell him about me,
what did you say?

1454
01:42:57,271 --> 01:43:00,638
You hit my Pa, you hit my Pa?

1455
01:43:01,108 --> 01:43:03,804
Now tell me who is the donkey?

1456
01:43:03,944 --> 01:43:05,172
It is me, me

1457
01:43:05,212 --> 01:43:07,339
Who is a goat's uncle?

1458
01:43:07,714 --> 01:43:08,612
It is me, me

1459
01:43:08,815 --> 01:43:10,146
Who is a lame ass?

1460
01:43:10,317 --> 01:43:11,306
Me, it is me

1461
01:43:11,518 --> 01:43:15,352
Now that the wind has gone out of
this balloon, it has collapsed

1462
01:43:15,522 --> 01:43:18,821
You there go off now, get out of our way

1463
01:43:19,226 --> 01:43:21,660
or else I'll pierce
your can of whoop-ass

1464
01:43:21,828 --> 01:43:26,356
You've talked enough nonsense,
now come and see us off at the gate

1465
01:43:26,533 --> 01:43:27,830
Bunnu, my son, where did you learn this?

1466
01:43:28,035 --> 01:43:29,229
Saw it in a movie, Pa

1467
01:43:29,570 --> 01:43:32,334
And you there, just remember
Bunnu is not a pole

1468
01:43:32,472 --> 01:43:36,431
. . .that any dog can piss on

1469
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:41,970
Now get lost!

1470
01:43:43,150 --> 01:43:46,142
You people don't worry, okay?

1471
01:43:46,386 --> 01:43:51,483
It is the first time that
Pappu Pager has met a real man

1472
01:43:52,859 --> 01:43:55,657
Will have to think about it

1473
01:43:56,263 --> 01:43:59,960
I have studied this in great depth

1474
01:44:00,100 --> 01:44:01,294
What, Gafoor?

1475
01:44:01,535 --> 01:44:04,299
That there is a great difference
between you and Bunnu

1476
01:44:04,438 --> 01:44:06,303
You are right, Gafoor

1477
01:44:06,807 --> 01:44:09,241
We are poles apart

1478
01:44:10,310 --> 01:44:13,711
Neha can only belong to Bunnu

1479
01:44:13,914 --> 01:44:16,940
Don't you dare link Bunnu's name
with that of Neha

1480
01:44:17,150 --> 01:44:19,243
Neha is mine, mine only

1481
01:44:19,620 --> 01:44:21,611
Are you my friend or Bunnu's?
You are taking his side

1482
01:44:21,822 --> 01:44:24,655
I am not taking sides at all,
just stating facts

1483
01:44:24,825 --> 01:44:29,319
Bunnu is born rich while we are
the poorest of Amirpur

1484
01:44:29,930 --> 01:44:33,627
Bunnu comes of a respected family,
whereas no one knows our parentage

1485
01:44:34,034 --> 01:44:36,366
Bunnu has a house, wads of money,
and what have we?

1486
01:44:36,536 --> 01:44:38,868
A small amount is left out of the
money we stole

1487
01:44:39,039 --> 01:44:43,237
If you marry Neha, this money will also
have gone before the honeymoon

1488
01:44:43,377 --> 01:44:47,438
It is just the money that will be gone,
not my love is it?

1489
01:44:47,881 --> 01:44:51,874
Love does not look at riches or
high standing

1490
01:44:52,085 --> 01:44:56,579
Raja, this kind of dialogue suits
the hero of a movie

1491
01:44:57,057 --> 01:44:59,184
. . .it does not suit you

1492
01:44:59,359 --> 01:45:01,987
What have you got, tell me?

1493
01:45:02,596 --> 01:45:04,393
This is what I have

1494
01:45:04,598 --> 01:45:05,223
What is it?

1495
01:45:05,399 --> 01:45:08,596
This perfume, and the moment
this goes to work, Neha will become mine

1496
01:45:08,802 --> 01:45:10,292
You have lost your mind

1497
01:45:10,637 --> 01:45:13,299
Don't boast on the strength of this
cheap gift

1498
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:17,235
Gafoor, stop thinking small,
start thinking big

1499
01:45:17,611 --> 01:45:19,602
Big, big

1500
01:45:19,813 --> 01:45:22,008
And look at this quality

1501
01:45:27,854 --> 01:45:30,414
Hi, sweetheart, I was waiting for you

1502
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:32,216
Really? My friend, Gafoor

1503
01:45:32,359 --> 01:45:33,257
Hi Guff

1504
01:45:34,761 --> 01:45:35,819
Tina, watch it

1505
01:45:35,962 --> 01:45:39,363
Take this perfume and spray it on Bunnu

1506
01:45:39,533 --> 01:45:42,229
He will fall madly in love with you

1507
01:45:42,336 --> 01:45:45,169
Don't waste your time girl,
he is out of his mind

1508
01:45:45,339 --> 01:45:48,035
Bunnu is not going to fall for you
Go on, go home

1509
01:45:48,241 --> 01:45:51,267
Tina, try this perfume on Gafoor

1510
01:45:51,645 --> 01:45:54,239
Yeah, go ahead,
I am not going to lose anything

1511
01:45:55,182 --> 01:45:58,151
I have smelt it,
it is of very poor quality

1512
01:46:00,287 --> 01:46:04,223
Tina ! This is A- 1 quality

1513
01:46:05,225 --> 01:46:08,285
I love you Tina
There is no life without you

1514
01:46:08,729 --> 01:46:11,197
Raja, help No one can stop me

1515
01:46:11,398 --> 01:46:12,888
Gafoor, Gafoor, let go of her

1516
01:46:13,033 --> 01:46:14,295
Tina go away, go away

1517
01:46:14,434 --> 01:46:16,834
Raja, stop him or our friendship
will suffer

1518
01:46:17,003 --> 01:46:18,834
Tina, I love you

1519
01:46:19,206 --> 01:46:21,606
Gafoor Hey, let go of me

1520
01:46:29,850 --> 01:46:32,114
Wow!

1521
01:46:36,056 --> 01:46:41,323
The Lord be praised

1522
01:46:43,230 --> 01:46:44,822
Excuse me, madam, you. . .

1523
01:46:44,965 --> 01:46:48,833
Can you help me find this place, please?

1524
01:46:49,569 --> 01:46:51,434
Who am I to help you find anything

1525
01:46:51,638 --> 01:46:53,731
I have been lost all my life

1526
01:46:53,874 --> 01:46:56,775
By the way, could you not find
a better person for asking directions?

1527
01:46:56,943 --> 01:46:59,377
I mean, someone outside. . .
I did meet many people,

1528
01:46:59,746 --> 01:47:03,011
But none as good a man as you

1529
01:47:06,520 --> 01:47:12,823
Look, I know nothing about this address
But somehow it looks familiar

1530
01:47:13,226 --> 01:47:15,421
And this address, this address. . .

1531
01:47:15,595 --> 01:47:17,586
This is the address of this place

1532
01:47:18,031 --> 01:47:22,195
And after finding this address,
you don't need to go anywhere else

1533
01:47:22,736 --> 01:47:24,829
Because I don't know why I feel

1534
01:47:25,005 --> 01:47:28,941
that this address is
your actual destination

1535
01:47:29,443 --> 01:47:33,174
Many have found their
true destination here

1536
01:47:33,213 --> 01:47:38,207
. . .you are very beautiful

1537
01:47:41,621 --> 01:47:46,024
whether you agree or don't

1538
01:47:47,260 --> 01:47:50,559
you belong to me

1539
01:47:54,968 --> 01:47:56,230
Hey, wait, wait

1540
01:47:56,369 --> 01:48:02,171
Looks like I have given an over-dose
Okay, I am going, goodbye

1541
01:48:28,435 --> 01:48:32,929
The window opened slightly,
the curtain moved slightly

1542
01:48:38,845 --> 01:48:42,804
The room of my heart was empty,
someone slipped in

1543
01:48:43,250 --> 01:48:47,414
And there was turmoil, there was turmoil

1544
01:52:55,301 --> 01:53:00,238
Hey you son of a baker,
you in this Mercedes?

1545
01:53:02,208 --> 01:53:03,505
Hey, baker yourself Pa,

1546
01:53:03,643 --> 01:53:05,270
Oh keep quiet, don't go Pa, Pa, Pa
all the time

1547
01:53:05,311 --> 01:53:06,175
You milk-man

1548
01:53:06,212 --> 01:53:08,112
What are you saying?
I told you to shut up

1549
01:53:08,314 --> 01:53:12,410
You don't know this is Kishore Chand,
my bosom pal from childhood

1550
01:53:12,619 --> 01:53:13,415
Bosom pal?

1551
01:53:13,953 --> 01:53:16,217
Hey, Chandu, isn't that right

1552
01:53:17,323 --> 01:53:20,349
Hey, Birju it is you, you rascal !

1553
01:53:22,829 --> 01:53:27,357
Bunnu did not tell us
you were his parents

1554
01:53:27,534 --> 01:53:28,762
Neither did it occur to us that,

1555
01:53:28,935 --> 01:53:32,530
a talented girl like Neha
could be your daughter!

1556
01:53:34,874 --> 01:53:38,435
Had I known this, I would have
brought her home myself,

1557
01:53:38,645 --> 01:53:41,170
not taken an appointment for it

1558
01:53:41,648 --> 01:53:43,843
Neha has been singing Bunnu's praises

1559
01:53:44,050 --> 01:53:45,039
Please speak about it

1560
01:53:45,251 --> 01:53:49,187
Bunnu deserves all praise
Time flies in his company

1561
01:53:49,355 --> 01:53:50,344
Please come here, daughter

1562
01:53:50,490 --> 01:53:53,891
Our Bunnu is also singinging
Neha's praises all the time

1563
01:53:54,060 --> 01:53:58,258
We had also hoped for a daughter
But God did not answer our prayers

1564
01:53:58,565 --> 01:54:00,931
Why do you say that,
consider Neha as your own daughter

1565
01:54:01,100 --> 01:54:05,230
It is true, Neha gives me the feeling of
being my own

1566
01:54:05,605 --> 01:54:07,004
Please say it I'll say it, son

1567
01:54:07,140 --> 01:54:08,402
Sorry, you don't worry, young fellow

1568
01:54:08,608 --> 01:54:11,600
He is my childhood friend, if he refuses
he will get thrashed by me

1569
01:54:12,011 --> 01:54:13,000
What is it?

1570
01:54:13,213 --> 01:54:15,147
It's like this, our. . . Greetings!

1571
01:54:15,348 --> 01:54:16,906
Greetings Come in, young man

1572
01:54:17,617 --> 01:54:19,346
Now we won't be able to talk!

1573
01:54:19,519 --> 01:54:21,851
Greetings Come, Raj

1574
01:54:22,822 --> 01:54:23,754
How do you do, Sir?

1575
01:54:23,923 --> 01:54:28,121
Okay, this is Raj Kumar, and these are
Bunnu's father and his mother

1576
01:54:28,261 --> 01:54:30,855
Bunnu's parents! I salute you

1577
01:54:31,231 --> 01:54:32,721
Give your blessings, Mother

1578
01:54:32,866 --> 01:54:33,730
Hi Neha Hi

1579
01:54:34,033 --> 01:54:37,867
Bunnu's father, salutations
Mr. Raj. . . America

1580
01:54:38,338 --> 01:54:39,669
Bunnu, you look very happy

1581
01:54:39,839 --> 01:54:41,636
We are meeting after so long,
won't you hug me?

1582
01:54:41,774 --> 01:54:44,242
Come I am coming

1583
01:54:44,344 --> 01:54:45,936
Yes, friend, come

1584
01:54:46,145 --> 01:54:49,444
Mr. Raj, you seem to make a habit of
dropping in at the wrong moment!

1585
01:54:49,649 --> 01:54:52,846
Had you come a little later, we'd have
finished talking about my marriage

1586
01:54:52,986 --> 01:54:55,454
Bunnu, I want to give you a surprise
What?

1587
01:54:55,655 --> 01:54:57,247
I have clicked some photographs of yours

1588
01:54:57,457 --> 01:54:58,754
When? Oh, don't you know?

1589
01:54:58,892 --> 01:55:01,326
When you see them you will be delighted

1590
01:55:01,694 --> 01:55:02,524
Delighted? Yes

1591
01:55:02,795 --> 01:55:06,196
Bunnu, my son, we'd also like to see,
show them to everybody

1592
01:55:06,532 --> 01:55:08,693
No, no, it is my photograph,
I'll see first

1593
01:55:08,835 --> 01:55:10,393
If I like it, I will show it to you all

1594
01:55:10,603 --> 01:55:11,797
Isn't it so, Mr. Raj? Okay, okay

1595
01:55:11,938 --> 01:55:15,601
If Bunnu likes it, he will
show it to you all, okay

1596
01:55:16,442 --> 01:55:18,410
Come Bunnu, sit near me

1597
01:55:18,611 --> 01:55:20,203
Mr. Raj, please do show the photograph

1598
01:55:20,413 --> 01:55:22,313
Bunnu you are too impatient
Mr. Raj, I cannot help it

1599
01:55:22,448 --> 01:55:24,109
Please show me, please show

1600
01:55:24,317 --> 01:55:26,217
Oh ! Where is my video camera !

1601
01:55:26,352 --> 01:55:28,320
These days who takes the trouble
to photograph others

1602
01:55:28,354 --> 01:55:30,254
I do Mr. Raj, how sweet

1603
01:55:30,423 --> 01:55:32,220
Mr. Raj Very sweet, indeed

1604
01:55:32,425 --> 01:55:35,622
Mr. Raj, Mr. Raj, Mr. Raj

1605
01:55:43,436 --> 01:55:45,370
Didn't you like it?

1606
01:55:46,272 --> 01:55:48,672
It is good, very good?

1607
01:55:50,143 --> 01:55:51,371
It is good

1608
01:55:51,744 --> 01:55:52,438
Did you like it or not?

1609
01:55:52,645 --> 01:55:54,670
Mr. Raj. . .
I'm asking you, did you like it or not?

1610
01:55:54,881 --> 01:55:56,746
Mr. Raj ! What's the matter, son?

1611
01:55:57,050 --> 01:55:58,881
Hey, why are you crying,
didn't you like it?

1612
01:55:59,052 --> 01:56:00,576
Pa ! What's the matter with him?

1613
01:56:00,787 --> 01:56:04,223
Tell me Bunnu, did you like it?
He will now show it to all

1614
01:56:04,590 --> 01:56:06,524
No, Pa, don't speak on that topic!

1615
01:56:06,693 --> 01:56:08,888
Okay, I understand, he's cross with me

1616
01:56:09,028 --> 01:56:10,290
Because I didn't speak
on his topic earlier

1617
01:56:10,430 --> 01:56:12,796
No, no, Pa, don't speak on the subject
Alright, son, I won't,

1618
01:56:12,999 --> 01:56:14,296
Only when you wish, okay?

1619
01:56:14,434 --> 01:56:16,994
What is the matter son,
are you not well?

1620
01:56:17,203 --> 01:56:18,397
Suddenly I'm feeling unwell, Mom

1621
01:56:18,538 --> 01:56:19,800
Shall I give some medicine, Bunnu?

1622
01:56:19,939 --> 01:56:21,998
Not medicine, I need prayers,
please don't discuss that issue

1623
01:56:22,208 --> 01:56:25,405
Don't be stubborn. Don't pull
my trousers and return the cassette

1624
01:56:25,611 --> 01:56:29,206
Let him take it,
I have another cop y of it

1625
01:56:29,248 --> 01:56:31,808
Please don't speak to them
about that matter

1626
01:56:31,951 --> 01:56:35,148
Before he pulls off my trousers,
I beg your pardon. Come, let us go

1627
01:56:35,321 --> 01:56:36,549
Okay, Uncle, salutations Fine

1628
01:56:36,723 --> 01:56:38,315
All right Ms Neha, bye Hi, hi

1629
01:56:38,458 --> 01:56:40,221
Pa, please do not talk

1630
01:56:40,360 --> 01:56:41,622
No, don't say goodbye to him

1631
01:56:42,228 --> 01:56:44,526
He is the same as before
He isn't cured at all

1632
01:56:44,664 --> 01:56:46,154
I think he has gone mad

1633
01:56:46,332 --> 01:56:48,562
What nonsense are you talking
about my son

1634
01:56:48,735 --> 01:56:50,828
Didn't you see how he was behaving
like a mad man?

1635
01:56:51,037 --> 01:56:53,369
With what great hopes we had gone
to fix his marriage!

1636
01:56:53,740 --> 01:56:55,640
He has been after me, ''fix my marriage''

1637
01:56:55,842 --> 01:56:57,776
But whenever I started to talk about it
over there,

1638
01:56:57,944 --> 01:56:59,309
he kept saying, ''please don't talk,
please don't talk''

1639
01:56:59,345 --> 01:57:02,781
By doing this he was disgracing me
Pa, I did all that deliberately

1640
01:57:02,982 --> 01:57:05,974
Deliberately? I got into a fix

1641
01:57:06,386 --> 01:57:08,183
Why don't you say plainly
you were in a fix

1642
01:57:08,321 --> 01:57:09,879
I cannot disclose in front of Mom
Mom, you go

1643
01:57:10,089 --> 01:57:11,784
Why? Why can't you talk in front of me?

1644
01:57:11,924 --> 01:57:13,186
Mom, please But. . .

1645
01:57:13,393 --> 01:57:16,487
All right, she's going
Don't worry, I'm going

1646
01:57:18,231 --> 01:57:19,289
Yes, what is it?

1647
01:57:19,699 --> 01:57:21,496
Check it out

1648
01:57:22,201 --> 01:57:23,293
What is this?

1649
01:57:23,636 --> 01:57:25,900
Video, V. C. R., turn it on and see

1650
01:57:30,810 --> 01:57:32,300
That Raj Kumar, the one from America,

1651
01:57:32,512 --> 01:57:34,412
he kept threatening me over there
Threatening you?

1652
01:57:34,547 --> 01:57:39,211
Saying if you talk about marriage
he will show it to Neha's family

1653
01:57:39,352 --> 01:57:42,150
Oh, this could ruin all your plans
Of course!

1654
01:57:42,321 --> 01:57:44,414
Sir, Inspector Mhatre is here

1655
01:57:44,557 --> 01:57:46,752
Inspector! ! Was the girl a minor?

1656
01:57:46,926 --> 01:57:50,555
That's not the question. She came here,
I didn't go to her place

1657
01:57:50,730 --> 01:57:52,630
This is a plain fact, yes

1658
01:57:53,866 --> 01:57:57,427
Inspector, my son is
not guilty of anything,

1659
01:57:57,637 --> 01:58:00,970
the party had come here,
he did not go to the party's house

1660
01:58:01,174 --> 01:58:01,765
Party?

1661
01:58:01,974 --> 01:58:04,966
He seems unaware of anything. Why are
you disclosing everything yourself?

1662
01:58:05,178 --> 01:58:06,577
Don't grab my trousers, please don't

1663
01:58:06,712 --> 01:58:10,910
Look, I have come to ask you people
if you've seen this person anywhere

1664
01:58:11,117 --> 01:58:12,778
Can you tell me where I can find him?

1665
01:58:12,985 --> 01:58:14,782
Oh, this Mr. Raj Kumar from America

1666
01:58:14,987 --> 01:58:17,387
America? He wouldn't even have seen
a map of America

1667
01:58:17,590 --> 01:58:20,423
He's a well known bad character
of Amirpur

1668
01:58:20,593 --> 01:58:23,687
A ''bad character''?
He's absconded with the Railway Pay-roll

1669
01:58:23,830 --> 01:58:25,991
Pa ! He's wanted by police

1670
01:58:26,132 --> 01:58:27,030
Bunnu

1671
01:58:35,541 --> 01:58:39,307
Bunnu, don't become emotional
Look, this is Inspector Mhatre

1672
01:58:39,345 --> 01:58:41,745
Let me cry, Pa

1673
01:58:45,852 --> 01:58:48,412
This guy has hurt me very much

1674
01:58:48,921 --> 01:58:50,821
You have given me great relief

1675
01:58:53,526 --> 01:58:56,461
Hey stop it, stop it, stop, stop

1676
01:58:57,029 --> 01:58:59,020
Mr. Pager, why are you roaming around
with this photograph?

1677
01:58:59,165 --> 01:59:00,860
Oh you full moon of a black night,

1678
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:04,959
you'll need a lot of time to understand
the working of Pappu Pager's brain

1679
01:59:05,104 --> 01:59:08,164
Do you understand?
Look, this is Bunnu's enemy

1680
01:59:08,374 --> 01:59:10,274
Me, Bunnu's enemy

1681
01:59:10,610 --> 01:59:16,276
Today the enemies will shake hands
and avenge Bunnu's insult

1682
01:59:24,290 --> 01:59:28,192
Hey hero, this is your photograph,
is it not?

1683
01:59:28,327 --> 01:59:29,794
No, it's the famous cricketer Tendulkar

1684
01:59:29,996 --> 01:59:33,295
Look, Pappu Pager has no time
to fool around

1685
01:59:33,633 --> 01:59:35,726
Tell me straight, is this you or not

1686
01:59:35,902 --> 01:59:38,928
Are you blind that you cannot tell
this is my photograph !

1687
01:59:39,105 --> 01:59:41,335
Oh ! I know very well
that this is your photograph

1688
01:59:41,507 --> 01:59:44,601
But Pappu Pager first checks,
then bashes

1689
01:59:45,111 --> 01:59:47,170
All right then, I check and confirm

1690
01:59:47,213 --> 01:59:49,147
First tell me, how did you get
this photograph?

1691
01:59:49,348 --> 01:59:52,806
It must be some girl's father
who is going around on an enquiry

1692
01:59:53,019 --> 01:59:56,011
Listen, you side kick, don't interrupt,
understand?

1693
01:59:56,155 --> 01:59:59,215
Do you want me to come alongside
and talk, then. . .

1694
01:59:59,759 --> 02:00:01,021
Hey, hey mister, hey

1695
02:00:01,160 --> 02:00:03,219
Just tell me how did you get hold of
this photograph

1696
02:00:03,429 --> 02:00:09,561
A boy named Bunnu gave me a contract
for your murder

1697
02:00:09,735 --> 02:00:13,227
and he brought this photograph also

1698
02:00:18,277 --> 02:00:21,246
You've taken a contract for killing me?

1699
02:00:21,447 --> 02:00:24,245
That is why Pappu has come to you

1700
02:00:24,450 --> 02:00:26,384
You, washed out old rag

1701
02:00:26,752 --> 02:00:30,051
What do you take me for that
you can murder me so easily

1702
02:00:30,256 --> 02:00:33,453
Hey, don't touch, let me explain

1703
02:00:33,593 --> 02:00:37,256
You dolt, you will explain to me?

1704
02:00:37,396 --> 02:00:40,661
Hey stop pushing, let me explain

1705
02:00:40,866 --> 02:00:43,357
You, son of a gun, you

1706
02:00:43,502 --> 02:00:46,665
Hey, you guys all keep standing
to one side

1707
02:00:46,872 --> 02:00:49,272
or else I will bash you all up too

1708
02:00:49,609 --> 02:00:53,670
Listen you Pappu Pager,
if you talk of murder again

1709
02:00:54,113 --> 02:00:57,276
I will pulverise you, get it?

1710
02:00:57,617 --> 02:01:00,313
Come on, Gafoor Let's go

1711
02:01:06,325 --> 02:01:09,021
You guys don't worry, okay

1712
02:01:09,161 --> 02:01:14,121
Today is the second time that
Pappu Pager has met a man with nerve

1713
02:01:14,834 --> 02:01:17,268
I will have to think this out

1714
02:01:17,637 --> 02:01:21,573
The perfume spray has worked like magic

1715
02:01:21,741 --> 02:01:24,437
Now Bunnu will stop loving Neha
for ever! !

1716
02:01:24,644 --> 02:01:26,202
Hey, who was he tangling with

1717
02:01:26,245 --> 02:01:28,076
I will settle his hash,
trying to tangle with me

1718
02:01:28,281 --> 02:01:30,442
Now he can amuse himself
by watching the cassette

1719
02:01:30,583 --> 02:01:32,346
Listen, Gafoor, I should not delay now

1720
02:01:32,485 --> 02:01:34,976
Go at once to the village
and fetch my mother

1721
02:01:35,154 --> 02:01:38,282
I want to talk about marriage to Neha

1722
02:01:39,091 --> 02:01:41,286
You will manage to talk, won't you?
Otherwise I rather not go

1723
02:01:41,460 --> 02:01:43,360
Go, man, go and bring Mother along

1724
02:01:43,496 --> 02:01:46,659
What is it, Raja, on the phone you said
it was something very important

1725
02:01:46,799 --> 02:01:49,666
I will say it, I definitely will

1726
02:01:50,870 --> 02:01:54,601
Ms. Neha, admittedly you are
very beautiful, aren't you?

1727
02:01:54,774 --> 02:01:57,368
I don't know, but people do say that

1728
02:01:57,510 --> 02:02:00,172
They are right, absolutely right

1729
02:02:00,446 --> 02:02:04,815
When you speak, it feels like you are
strewing petals from your lips

1730
02:02:05,217 --> 02:02:08,812
When you smile, it feels like
a heavenly lyre is playing

1731
02:02:09,622 --> 02:02:11,214
When you lift your eyes. . .

1732
02:02:11,357 --> 02:02:14,952
. . .stop, stop. What is the reason
you are praising me so highly today?

1733
02:02:15,261 --> 02:02:17,957
Should I take this to mean, what you
want to say is very important?

1734
02:02:18,130 --> 02:02:20,724
Ms Neha, I do have very important things
to say to you

1735
02:02:20,866 --> 02:02:22,766
Then please do, we've been here
almost two hours,

1736
02:02:22,935 --> 02:02:25,267
but your ''something important''
hasn't even started !

1737
02:02:25,638 --> 02:02:27,037
Daddy must be waiting for me,

1738
02:02:27,239 --> 02:02:30,037
Today even I got to speak to him
on a crucial matter

1739
02:02:30,176 --> 02:02:33,202
Actually, you see, Ms Neha,
it's like this. . .

1740
02:02:33,245 --> 02:02:37,238
. . .just today my Mother from America. . .

1741
02:02:37,383 --> 02:02:41,843
Hi, Ms Neha Hi, Bunnu

1742
02:02:42,555 --> 02:02:45,046
Hi, Mr. Raj Hi, Bunnu

1743
02:02:45,291 --> 02:02:49,751
What is going on, eh?
Great tea party going on !

1744
02:02:49,895 --> 02:02:51,863
I knew I would find you here

1745
02:02:52,465 --> 02:02:55,263
Actually, Ms Neha,
it is his profession to buy land

1746
02:02:55,601 --> 02:02:57,000
and it is my profession to sell land

1747
02:02:57,169 --> 02:03:02,004
Oh, that I. . .
And today I'm going to show him a piece,

1748
02:03:03,409 --> 02:03:05,809
that will warm the cockles of his heart

1749
02:03:06,011 --> 02:03:09,412
Look, Bunnu, I am busy just now,
you may meet me again later

1750
02:03:09,615 --> 02:03:11,310
Don't worry, you don't have to
go anywhere

1751
02:03:11,450 --> 02:03:12,815
I have just to show it to you

1752
02:03:13,018 --> 02:03:16,249
and if that land goes to someone else
then you will be very sorry

1753
02:03:16,422 --> 02:03:18,117
Look, Bunnu, I. . .

1754
02:03:18,257 --> 02:03:22,250
I think you had better look at it

1755
02:03:22,962 --> 02:03:24,361
Please tell him to take a look

1756
02:03:24,530 --> 02:03:26,862
Bunnu, I've given up this pro. . .
He loves you so much, you should

1757
02:03:27,032 --> 02:03:28,226
What have you got to lose?

1758
02:03:28,367 --> 02:03:30,426
If you say so, otherwise I. . .

1759
02:03:30,636 --> 02:03:32,934
Thank you Ms Neha, he must see it

1760
02:03:33,072 --> 02:03:34,334
It is okay

1761
02:03:40,780 --> 02:03:42,748
What happened, what happened, eh?

1762
02:03:42,948 --> 02:03:46,349
It is good, the land is good

1763
02:03:46,752 --> 02:03:48,686
Is it not? Yeah, I knew. . .

1764
02:03:48,854 --> 02:03:51,152
after seeing it he is going to like
everything about me

1765
02:03:51,290 --> 02:03:53,053
Now it is a very good thing
that you came along

1766
02:03:53,259 --> 02:03:55,454
You two discuss business
and I will get going

1767
02:03:55,661 --> 02:03:58,061
Thank you Ms Neha Bye bye

1768
02:04:05,838 --> 02:04:08,204
By God, why are you hounding me

1769
02:04:08,541 --> 02:04:10,600
Whenever things are starting
to look up for me,

1770
02:04:10,743 --> 02:04:13,303
you come along and spoil them

1771
02:04:13,612 --> 02:04:15,273
What is it that you want?

1772
02:04:15,314 --> 02:04:18,408
What I want is that you should
get out of Neha's life for good

1773
02:04:18,617 --> 02:04:21,051
Or the long distance view that I have
shown of Inspector Mhatre

1774
02:04:21,220 --> 02:04:22,812
. . .will have to become a close-up

1775
02:04:22,955 --> 02:04:24,547
I have the cassette O Mummy!

1776
02:04:24,723 --> 02:04:26,156
Cassette! !

1777
02:04:26,325 --> 02:04:29,852
You have shown me
a long shot of Mr. Mhatre

1778
02:04:30,029 --> 02:04:33,157
I will expose this cassette of yours
on the TV

1779
02:04:33,332 --> 02:04:35,061
But this will not do, Raj. . . Mr. Raj

1780
02:04:35,234 --> 02:04:37,429
I mean one of us will have to make
the sacrifice

1781
02:04:37,570 --> 02:04:39,231
It will have to be you

1782
02:04:39,438 --> 02:04:41,429
But why will it have to be me?

1783
02:04:41,841 --> 02:04:44,639
Because I am not the sacrificing type,

1784
02:04:45,244 --> 02:04:49,738
who will hand over his lady love
to his rival

1785
02:04:50,382 --> 02:04:52,873
And I am no such Romeo either,

1786
02:04:53,352 --> 02:04:57,254
who will tamely hand over
his Juliet to another

1787
02:04:57,756 --> 02:05:04,821
I am not one who will commit suicide
to clear the way

1788
02:05:05,431 --> 02:05:14,339
Same here, I am not likely to
blind myself like the hero of a tragedy

1789
02:05:14,840 --> 02:05:19,106
and then roam the streets,
requesting people to stop their cars

1790
02:05:19,645 --> 02:05:20,612
Stop the car

1791
02:05:20,813 --> 02:05:23,008
Somebody help me cross the road
I will help you

1792
02:05:23,215 --> 02:05:24,307
Raju, my son

1793
02:05:24,350 --> 02:05:25,840
What! Mother!

1794
02:05:26,619 --> 02:05:30,248
Son, I was delayed a little
Coming to meet my daughter-in-law,

1795
02:05:30,422 --> 02:05:33,152
for the first time
I had to bring some sweets, isn't it?

1796
02:05:33,325 --> 02:05:34,417
Is this your mother? Yes

1797
02:05:34,560 --> 02:05:35,754
Salutations Mother God bless you

1798
02:05:35,928 --> 02:05:38,328
Who is this, Raju? This is Bunnu

1799
02:05:38,664 --> 02:05:40,131
You are his mother,
so you are like my own mother

1800
02:05:40,266 --> 02:05:41,233
Yes, yes, son, why not

1801
02:05:41,567 --> 02:05:42,966
Let's talk about your marriage
while Bunnu is here

1802
02:05:43,135 --> 02:05:45,126
Bunnu is a very good friend of Neha too

1803
02:05:45,271 --> 02:05:47,068
Shall we go up? No Mother, not up

1804
02:05:47,239 --> 02:05:48,228
Let us go out, out

1805
02:05:48,374 --> 02:05:51,775
Why go out, Son? Don't we have to talk
to the girl and her father?

1806
02:05:51,944 --> 02:05:54,139
Some other time
Why some other time, why not now?

1807
02:05:54,346 --> 02:05:57,543
Why are you putting it off, why later?
What if mother doesn't find time?

1808
02:05:57,683 --> 02:06:00,914
Then. . .?
The stars aren't right today

1809
02:06:01,220 --> 02:06:02,187
So let us go, Mother

1810
02:06:02,388 --> 02:06:07,382
Listen, Raj, I also ought to make a move
The Inspector would be waiting

1811
02:06:07,526 --> 02:06:11,394
Right, and I also have to air
the cassette on TV, get it?

1812
02:06:15,200 --> 02:06:17,498
How long is this cassette story going
to go on !

1813
02:06:17,636 --> 02:06:19,627
This marriage cannot take place!
Daddy, please. . .

1814
02:06:19,805 --> 02:06:22,899
You kept me in the dark,
I thought you were simply good friends

1815
02:06:23,042 --> 02:06:25,203
Yes, I did tell you we were good friends

1816
02:06:25,344 --> 02:06:29,644
but today I am telling you that I love
him, and it's him that I will marry

1817
02:06:29,815 --> 02:06:31,715
Neha, come to your senses,
he is not worthy of you

1818
02:06:31,850 --> 02:06:34,819
He does not deserve you,
you will not be happy with him

1819
02:06:35,020 --> 02:06:40,549
Daddy, this is my life and
I've to decide who I got to be with

1820
02:06:41,660 --> 02:06:43,628
And that's final !

1821
02:06:50,235 --> 02:06:51,930
Hello Hello Bunnu

1822
02:06:52,071 --> 02:06:54,938
Ms Neha ! How did you think of me?

1823
02:06:55,074 --> 02:07:00,034
I have good news
I have decided to get married

1824
02:07:00,980 --> 02:07:03,210
You come immediately to the
marriage court, at once

1825
02:07:03,382 --> 02:07:07,819
I will come on wings, Ms Neha,
don't say anything, I will come flying !

1826
02:07:08,988 --> 02:07:11,218
Mother, Pa ! Bunnu

1827
02:07:13,525 --> 02:07:17,086
Mom, Mom your blessings have
brought fruit

1828
02:07:17,229 --> 02:07:20,995
Neha has called me for marriage,
to come alone with the ring

1829
02:07:21,133 --> 02:07:24,534
Now you wait for our return,
and bless us as we come through the door

1830
02:07:24,703 --> 02:07:28,503
Call all the bigwigs, there would be a
grand party here in the evening

1831
02:07:28,641 --> 02:07:31,439
and there should be marriage trumpets
all over. I'll just return. . .

1832
02:07:31,610 --> 02:07:33,510
Bunnu, stand here
Yes, what's it?

1833
02:07:33,712 --> 02:07:35,407
You'll go like this?
Any problem?

1834
02:07:35,614 --> 02:07:38,947
There IS a problem
You're minus the clothes

1835
02:07:40,352 --> 02:07:41,319
Is that so?!

1836
02:07:41,654 --> 02:07:43,349
Hello, hello Neha Raj !

1837
02:07:43,522 --> 02:07:45,717
I was just about to call you myself
Really!

1838
02:07:45,858 --> 02:07:47,416
Yes, there is good news

1839
02:07:47,626 --> 02:07:53,030
Get a ring and a floral garland and come
immediately to the marriage court

1840
02:07:53,232 --> 02:07:54,460
But w. . . what is the matter?

1841
02:07:54,633 --> 02:07:56,965
I have decided to get married today

1842
02:07:57,236 --> 02:07:59,227
Marriage, marriage. . . marriage!

1843
02:07:59,371 --> 02:08:01,771
Look, how can I get married
if you don't come?

1844
02:08:01,907 --> 02:08:04,774
Oh, don't you worry one bit, Ms Neha

1845
02:08:04,977 --> 02:08:06,569
I will come on wings, I will come flying

1846
02:08:06,779 --> 02:08:08,178
Bye

1847
02:08:16,288 --> 02:08:21,089
I got him, I got him, at last I got him

1848
02:08:21,393 --> 02:08:24,385
He is it, he is the one
who broke my tooth

1849
02:08:38,644 --> 02:08:42,637
He is the one who ran away from the
Amirpur station with 25 million

1850
02:08:42,848 --> 02:08:43,906
Catch him, he is the one

1851
02:08:44,116 --> 02:08:45,447
You've brought a bad name to the police

1852
02:08:45,651 --> 02:08:47,619
Hey, I'm not the real thief,
it is these two frauds

1853
02:08:47,820 --> 02:08:51,312
Inspector, can an informer
be a thief himself, can he?

1854
02:08:51,457 --> 02:08:53,652
Will we get a reward?
Most certainly

1855
02:08:53,826 --> 02:08:56,852
Catch them, they are the ones
You just come with us

1856
02:09:00,199 --> 02:09:03,566
Gafoor my friend, today you have done
a final job for me

1857
02:09:03,702 --> 02:09:06,671
What?
By clearing my name off that robbery

1858
02:09:06,805 --> 02:09:09,171
Yeah, it's erased
Come, let me hug you one last time

1859
02:09:09,308 --> 02:09:11,173
Last time!
Are you going to commit suicide?

1860
02:09:11,376 --> 02:09:15,142
Not suicide, I am going to marry Neha
I don't need you anymore

1861
02:09:15,180 --> 02:09:18,206
If ever in trouble again,
I'll certainly remember you

1862
02:09:18,417 --> 02:09:21,181
Farewell, my friend, I am going

1863
02:09:21,520 --> 02:09:27,015
Go, go on, but you'll soon be
in trouble, selfish one!

1864
02:09:31,930 --> 02:09:38,733
I am restless without you, O my love

1865
02:09:39,938 --> 02:09:43,635
What am I to do? What to do?
What should I do?

1866
02:09:57,523 --> 02:10:02,324
Nothing has any meaning without you

1867
02:10:07,366 --> 02:10:10,267
Even with the whole world for me,

1868
02:10:10,869 --> 02:10:13,736
What would I do? What am I to do?

1869
02:13:19,057 --> 02:13:23,323
Raja, Bunnu, great!
You both are so handsomely dressed

1870
02:13:23,462 --> 02:13:24,952
It is good you have arrived

1871
02:13:25,130 --> 02:13:27,325
I was finding it difficult
to control my emotions

1872
02:13:27,466 --> 02:13:28,956
Ms Neha

1873
02:13:29,368 --> 02:13:31,632
Prem, Prem?

1874
02:13:34,072 --> 02:13:35,539
Prem ! !

1875
02:13:55,060 --> 02:13:56,391
Prem, meet. . .

1876
02:13:56,561 --> 02:13:58,995
Hang on ! This is Bunnu,

1877
02:13:59,898 --> 02:14:01,195
And this is Raj

1878
02:14:02,334 --> 02:14:04,802
Neha has praised you both
so much to me that

1879
02:14:05,003 --> 02:14:07,904
I would know you anywhere
even with my eyes closed

1880
02:14:08,040 --> 02:14:09,029
Bunnu

1881
02:14:09,241 --> 02:14:10,606
Raj

1882
02:14:14,146 --> 02:14:16,944
I have found a very good wife in Neha

1883
02:14:17,115 --> 02:14:19,310
and two good friends for life

1884
02:14:22,821 --> 02:14:25,517
Prem, I knew that my father may not
stand by my side

1885
02:14:25,657 --> 02:14:27,818
but these two would certainly be here

1886
02:14:28,026 --> 02:14:29,357
Neha, it's so nice. I mean,

1887
02:14:29,528 --> 02:14:32,326
we are getting married,
but appropriately dressed are they

1888
02:14:32,664 --> 02:14:33,426
So sweet!

1889
02:14:33,632 --> 02:14:35,224
Look they have even brought
flower garlands for us

1890
02:14:35,367 --> 02:14:37,835
Neha, let us pray that
they also get married soon

1891
02:14:38,036 --> 02:14:39,628
Take it, pal
Thanks a lot, thank you

1892
02:14:39,838 --> 02:14:42,432
Neha, Prem, present yourselves

1893
02:14:43,475 --> 02:14:45,340
The girl appears to be of the right age

1894
02:14:45,944 --> 02:14:48,674
Prem Kumar, son of Jagdish Kumar

1895
02:14:49,247 --> 02:14:50,339
That's me, Sir

1896
02:14:51,450 --> 02:14:53,782
Neha, daughter of Chander Kapur

1897
02:14:53,952 --> 02:14:54,884
Me, Sir

1898
02:14:55,587 --> 02:14:57,987
Oh sorry. You two are entering
into this marriage,

1899
02:14:58,156 --> 02:15:01,091
without any pressure
and of your own free will?

1900
02:15:01,226 --> 02:15:02,818
Yes Okay, okay

1901
02:15:03,595 --> 02:15:05,620
Have you brought. . . that. . . that

1902
02:15:05,797 --> 02:15:08,095
Ring? Yes, yes, ring

1903
02:15:08,200 --> 02:15:10,998
I am sorry I forgot Prem !

1904
02:15:11,136 --> 02:15:12,296
You haven't?

1905
02:15:12,637 --> 02:15:14,628
Thank you Yeah, take it

1906
02:15:14,806 --> 02:15:17,832
Thank you Put it on the finger

1907
02:15:27,519 --> 02:15:29,350
Who are these two?

1908
02:15:29,721 --> 02:15:31,018
Friends Eh !

1909
02:15:31,223 --> 02:15:33,817
We are FRI ENDS

1910
02:15:34,526 --> 02:15:39,225
You two sign here in place of witnesses

1911
02:15:45,670 --> 02:15:48,366
Not the address, just the name. . .

1912
02:15:48,740 --> 02:15:51,573
What are you doing? So much?
Put the pen down

1913
02:15:52,644 --> 02:15:56,080
Now you are officially husband and wife

1914
02:15:56,248 --> 02:15:57,681
Felicitations on your marriage
Thank you, sir

1915
02:15:57,883 --> 02:15:59,248
All the best Thank you

1916
02:15:59,451 --> 02:16:00,213
Very Good ! Good !

1917
02:16:00,318 --> 02:16:02,411
C'mon, let's go. See you two outside

1918
02:16:02,787 --> 02:16:05,187
Mister, Mister. . .

1919
02:16:05,790 --> 02:16:09,521
I mean, I conduct such marriages daily,
have been doing it for years

1920
02:16:09,694 --> 02:16:11,286
but wish from the bottom of
my heart that,

1921
02:16:11,429 --> 02:16:14,193
girls and boys should not get married
in courts of law

1922
02:16:14,533 --> 02:16:18,594
Marriage is a matter of the heart,
a court's stamp on it is not right

1923
02:16:19,004 --> 02:16:21,302
And if the two people like each other,

1924
02:16:21,439 --> 02:16:24,408
then why should the parents object
they should get them married

1925
02:16:24,609 --> 02:16:29,205
Where the parents do not agree,
angels like you step in

1926
02:16:29,614 --> 02:16:33,015
they sign and legalize marriages
and help make lives

1927
02:16:33,552 --> 02:16:37,010
I think I am boring you two,
am I talking too much?

1928
02:16:37,422 --> 02:16:39,856
You are talking too much

1929
02:16:40,025 --> 02:16:44,052
What are you talking about?
Get going then

1930
02:16:45,664 --> 02:16:48,224
Wasted my time too

1931
02:17:28,206 --> 02:17:29,833
Both of us are out!

1932
02:17:31,543 --> 02:17:34,205
This world is a huge Bus Stop
and the girls are like buses!

1933
02:17:34,412 --> 02:17:38,212
Run after them and you miss them,
remain standing and another comes along

1934
02:17:38,250 --> 02:17:40,309
Look, here comes one now
My, my! Lovely!

1935
02:17:40,518 --> 02:17:41,610
Mummy!

1936
02:17:45,423 --> 02:17:49,120
Will she be able to cure me?
She'll have to, Raj, she'll have to

1937
02:17:49,261 --> 02:17:51,422
She will have to act as medicine for us
insane madmen

1938
02:17:51,630 --> 02:17:54,121
I am feeling okay, I am feeling better

1939
02:17:54,266 --> 02:17:55,426
Hey, where are you going?

1940
02:17:55,634 --> 02:17:58,660
Gafoor, where is he going,
get the scoundrel, hey!

1941
02:18:02,674 --> 02:18:05,006
Head or tail,

1942
02:18:05,944 --> 02:18:09,175
Love is a game of the heart

1943
02:18:16,521 --> 02:18:21,982
Some win the game, some do pass

1944
02:18:23,028 --> 02:18:26,293
and some will fail
