1
00:00:48,285 --> 00:00:51,357
If you knew you'd be compromising,

2
00:00:51,605 --> 00:00:53,118
why did you Maoists

3
00:00:53,285 --> 00:00:55,242
make all these promises

4
00:00:55,485 --> 00:00:58,125
to the ethnic minorities?

5
00:00:58,485 --> 00:01:03,400
We thought we would win the war outright!

6
00:01:08,405 --> 00:01:09,759
We Maoists may be running

7
00:01:09,925 --> 00:01:10,995
the government now,

8
00:01:11,205 --> 00:01:13,481
but we don't have a majority.

9
00:01:14,285 --> 00:01:16,595
We had to compromise with other parties

10
00:01:16,805 --> 00:01:18,159
to begin the peace process.

11
00:01:33,005 --> 00:01:33,961
Father?

12
00:01:35,445 --> 00:01:37,516
Father, are you up there?

13
00:01:39,325 --> 00:01:40,235
Father?

14
00:01:40,965 --> 00:01:42,683
Are you upstairs?

15
00:01:44,285 --> 00:01:45,514
Father!

16
00:01:46,165 --> 00:01:47,314
Father!

17
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:57,763
Pokhara! Bus to Pokhara!

18
00:02:06,285 --> 00:02:07,844
Pay the fare first.

19
00:02:08,605 --> 00:02:10,039
It's not 500. It's 1,200.

20
00:02:10,285 --> 00:02:11,764
1,200?

21
00:02:13,205 --> 00:02:15,674
I'll get a seat for sure, right? - Yes.

22
00:02:15,845 --> 00:02:18,405
When did it become 1,200? - Long time.

23
00:02:19,445 --> 00:02:20,844
Hurry, hurry.

24
00:02:21,045 --> 00:02:23,036
Can you give me a hand?

25
00:02:25,925 --> 00:02:28,599
Let's go, let's go.

26
00:02:57,805 --> 00:02:58,840
Will father's body

27
00:02:59,005 --> 00:03:00,518
fit through this window?

28
00:03:08,885 --> 00:03:10,922
We could've moved him through

29
00:03:11,085 --> 00:03:13,042
the door when he was alive,

30
00:03:13,285 --> 00:03:14,605
if Durga had let us know

31
00:03:14,765 --> 00:03:16,199
when he was going to die.

32
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:18,157
Yes, if I was clairvoyant.

33
00:03:21,365 --> 00:03:22,560
Come on...

34
00:03:22,965 --> 00:03:24,922
The body won't last long in this heat.

35
00:03:30,005 --> 00:03:32,565
How'd he get to be so heavy?

36
00:03:33,405 --> 00:03:36,204
I can't touch the body...

37
00:03:36,405 --> 00:03:38,078
It would pollute the ritual.

38
00:03:38,805 --> 00:03:39,795
Maybe we should wait

39
00:03:40,005 --> 00:03:40,915
for Chandra to arrive?

40
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,479
No, let's try once more.

41
00:03:44,365 --> 00:03:46,242
Slowly, slowly...

42
00:03:58,645 --> 00:04:01,478
Okay, let me just go out the window.

43
00:04:05,685 --> 00:04:07,358
Give me the feet!

44
00:04:10,325 --> 00:04:11,679
What are you doing?

45
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:12,795
He dropped him!

46
00:04:13,005 --> 00:04:14,234
Women can't touch the body!

47
00:04:14,405 --> 00:04:16,476
I can't let him fall! - Let him go!

48
00:04:24,005 --> 00:04:27,236
Shobha, go collect the herbs.

49
00:04:28,885 --> 00:04:30,398
We need to purify the body now.

50
00:04:30,605 --> 00:04:32,437
Purify him here? Let's take him

51
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,357
outside and purify him there.

52
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,363
This whole house is tainted.

53
00:04:36,565 --> 00:04:38,681
I looked after him while he was alive.

54
00:04:38,885 --> 00:04:40,717
Now you need to purify him?

55
00:04:48,325 --> 00:04:50,999
Mommy, let's stay with grandfather.

56
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:53,077
Pooja! It's enough.

57
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:59,800
Please. Let's stay with grandfather.

58
00:05:13,245 --> 00:05:16,283
I want to stay with grandfather!

59
00:05:18,525 --> 00:05:19,435
Pooja?

60
00:05:20,925 --> 00:05:22,757
Didn't you see how they treated us?

61
00:05:22,965 --> 00:05:25,400
It's because you touched the body.

62
00:05:33,685 --> 00:05:37,235
Hey, do you have my money yet?

63
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:40,960
Go away, I don't have any money.

64
00:05:41,965 --> 00:05:44,957
When I get some work, I'll pay you.

65
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:48,078
You've been saying that for a long time.

66
00:05:49,165 --> 00:05:50,075
Can I have this?

67
00:05:50,285 --> 00:05:51,844
Badri, where did you get it?

68
00:05:52,005 --> 00:05:53,404
I bet he stole it.

69
00:05:53,565 --> 00:05:55,238
The shopkeeper gave it to me.

70
00:05:55,445 --> 00:05:58,119
I am sure you stole it. - He's a liar.

71
00:06:03,165 --> 00:06:04,838
Go on, hit it.

72
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,724
Need a porter, sir?

73
00:06:08,925 --> 00:06:11,201
Get lost. I'll handle this.

74
00:06:12,325 --> 00:06:14,635
This is my job.

75
00:06:18,365 --> 00:06:20,163
I'll carry that for you.

76
00:06:20,365 --> 00:06:22,117
The road is difficult.

77
00:06:22,285 --> 00:06:24,162
You can't do it alone.

78
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:26,722
I won't charge much.

79
00:06:27,565 --> 00:06:29,954
Don't fight. I don't need a porter.

80
00:06:30,725 --> 00:06:32,602
The road is too steep. You'll need help.

81
00:06:32,805 --> 00:06:34,034
Leave me alone.

82
00:06:34,205 --> 00:06:37,118
Forget him! He's too stubborn.

83
00:06:37,285 --> 00:06:39,356
Give me your bags. I won't charge much.

84
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:40,435
I said no.

85
00:06:40,605 --> 00:06:42,243
Just give me 300 rupees.

86
00:06:42,445 --> 00:06:43,765
I can do it myself.

87
00:06:43,925 --> 00:06:45,245
The road is too steep.

88
00:06:47,645 --> 00:06:49,238
200 rupees?

89
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,401
Sir, you arrived from Qatar?

90
00:06:55,525 --> 00:06:56,435
No.

91
00:06:56,645 --> 00:06:57,840
Malaysia?

92
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:00,395
No.

93
00:07:00,685 --> 00:07:03,279
Then you must be coming from Dubai?

94
00:07:05,965 --> 00:07:06,875
How old are you?

95
00:07:07,085 --> 00:07:07,995
10 years old.

96
00:07:08,645 --> 00:07:09,635
10 years old?

97
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:11,398
These bags would crush you!

98
00:07:11,605 --> 00:07:13,323
How would you carry them?

99
00:07:13,525 --> 00:07:15,562
I'm not a human being.

100
00:07:15,725 --> 00:07:16,954
I'm a porter.

101
00:07:21,325 --> 00:07:22,235
Go home.

102
00:07:22,445 --> 00:07:24,675
Your parents must be worried.

103
00:07:26,845 --> 00:07:28,199
I don't have parents.

104
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:29,764
I don't have a home.

105
00:07:30,405 --> 00:07:31,440
Where do you live?

106
00:07:31,645 --> 00:07:32,965
At that bus station.

107
00:07:34,405 --> 00:07:36,442
Are you a soldier? - I was.

108
00:07:37,005 --> 00:07:39,997
Did you fight in the war?

109
00:07:43,525 --> 00:07:45,960
Did you shoot guns?

110
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,604
I like guns.

111
00:07:51,005 --> 00:07:53,121
See what a gun does?

112
00:07:56,405 --> 00:07:58,635
Does that look like fun?

113
00:08:05,805 --> 00:08:07,716
Go back to your friends.

114
00:08:14,045 --> 00:08:15,524
It will be better.

115
00:08:15,685 --> 00:08:17,995
You can go to school there.

116
00:08:18,205 --> 00:08:19,843
You know how they treat us

117
00:08:20,005 --> 00:08:21,040
in this village.

118
00:08:21,885 --> 00:08:24,081
You know what I mean.

119
00:08:27,845 --> 00:08:30,405
Will I meet my father in Pokhara?

120
00:08:36,205 --> 00:08:37,639
Please tell me.

121
00:08:37,805 --> 00:08:40,319
Is my father in Pokhara?

122
00:08:43,485 --> 00:08:45,123
What father?

123
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,435
Chandra.

124
00:08:48,085 --> 00:08:50,759
Who told you Chandra is your father?

125
00:08:54,965 --> 00:08:56,842
I heard.

126
00:08:59,765 --> 00:09:01,483
Why do you need a father?

127
00:09:01,645 --> 00:09:02,794
Aren't I enough?

128
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,843
Don't I love you?

129
00:09:08,685 --> 00:09:10,995
Haven't I loved you enough?

130
00:09:11,605 --> 00:09:13,596
Why do you need a father?

131
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,882
I can give you an education.

132
00:09:22,685 --> 00:09:24,562
Then you will be a big person.

133
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:27,075
You won't need anyone.

134
00:09:29,365 --> 00:09:31,641
I don't want to be a big person.

135
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:40,761
We can't leave him here.

136
00:09:42,325 --> 00:09:43,554
We can attach a pully here

137
00:09:43,725 --> 00:09:44,635
and lower him down.

138
00:09:44,845 --> 00:09:48,361
Do you think it will hold?

139
00:09:48,685 --> 00:09:52,724
Maybe we need to ask the priest.

140
00:09:54,245 --> 00:09:56,919
Look, your grandfather is stuck.

141
00:09:57,605 --> 00:09:58,925
No, he is not.

142
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,241
He'll start to rot.

143
00:10:01,485 --> 00:10:02,839
Then he'll just be bones

144
00:10:03,005 --> 00:10:04,325
and turn into a ghost.

145
00:10:04,525 --> 00:10:05,674
No, he won't.

146
00:10:06,445 --> 00:10:08,755
Your grandfather will come at midnight

147
00:10:08,965 --> 00:10:10,717
and turn you into a ghost, too!

148
00:11:02,605 --> 00:11:04,642
They're coming! - Who's coming?

149
00:11:04,885 --> 00:11:06,000
Chandra and his son.

150
00:11:06,245 --> 00:11:08,600
Chandra has a son?

151
00:11:16,685 --> 00:11:17,834
Stop pushing!

152
00:11:18,085 --> 00:11:19,280
Let me see.

153
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,639
I can offer you 20,000 rupees.

154
00:11:49,005 --> 00:11:50,916
Isn't 20 too little, sister?

155
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,917
If I brought the goats to Pokhara,

156
00:11:53,085 --> 00:11:54,598
I could get 50 at least.

157
00:11:54,845 --> 00:11:56,563
You wouldn't make it to Pokhara,

158
00:11:56,765 --> 00:11:59,200
the goats would need a separate bus fare.

159
00:11:59,365 --> 00:12:00,878
Feeding them, transporting them...

160
00:12:01,045 --> 00:12:01,955
Too much trouble.

161
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,321
I need to make a little profit, no?

162
00:12:04,885 --> 00:12:05,795
Don't I?

163
00:12:05,965 --> 00:12:07,399
It's too little, sister.

164
00:12:07,565 --> 00:12:08,760
I'm buying all your goats,

165
00:12:08,925 --> 00:12:10,563
can't you give me a good price?

166
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:14,439
Pooja, where have you been all morning?

167
00:12:15,165 --> 00:12:16,235
He's arrived.

168
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:17,765
Chandra.

169
00:12:19,245 --> 00:12:21,077
Chandra has come?

170
00:12:31,845 --> 00:12:33,358
Chandra, sir?

171
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,923
Aren't you Chandra?

172
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,195
Greetings, Aunt!

173
00:12:37,405 --> 00:12:39,237
My humble greetings, Chandra, sir!

174
00:12:39,445 --> 00:12:41,721
Please, Aunt, don't trouble yourself.

175
00:12:42,525 --> 00:12:43,924
We were all worried

176
00:12:44,085 --> 00:12:45,883
that you wouldn't come.

177
00:12:46,285 --> 00:12:48,481
Can you give me a hand?

178
00:12:53,485 --> 00:12:54,600
...but you're the son

179
00:12:54,765 --> 00:12:56,119
of the Village Chairman.

180
00:12:56,285 --> 00:12:57,480
If I don't call you Chandra,

181
00:12:57,645 --> 00:12:58,601
what should I call you?

182
00:12:58,765 --> 00:13:00,085
Call me Agni instead.

183
00:13:00,245 --> 00:13:02,156
How can you use your Party name here?

184
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:03,355
Yes, how can you?

185
00:13:03,525 --> 00:13:04,845
Here, I've brought him home.

186
00:13:05,005 --> 00:13:06,962
I thought a Party leader like

187
00:13:07,165 --> 00:13:09,475
you would come by helicopter.

188
00:13:09,805 --> 00:13:12,365
We were watching the skies,

189
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:13,754
not the road!

190
00:13:16,085 --> 00:13:17,439
No greeting...

191
00:13:17,805 --> 00:13:20,115
not with a death in the family.

192
00:13:21,565 --> 00:13:23,203
It's good you came.

193
00:13:23,405 --> 00:13:25,442
We didn't know if you Maoists

194
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:27,118
believe in cremation.

195
00:13:27,325 --> 00:13:28,235
Come.

196
00:13:30,485 --> 00:13:31,919
How are you, Suraj?

197
00:13:34,005 --> 00:13:35,882
I heard you quit the army.

198
00:13:36,885 --> 00:13:39,604
So I should be safe here, right?

199
00:13:42,685 --> 00:13:43,720
We can get along

200
00:13:43,885 --> 00:13:45,558
for a few days, can't we?

201
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,763
What could we do?

202
00:14:15,965 --> 00:14:17,239
We are too old.

203
00:14:17,405 --> 00:14:19,840
We couldn't carry him down.

204
00:14:20,045 --> 00:14:21,558
Why not get someone to help?

205
00:14:21,805 --> 00:14:22,715
Who?

206
00:14:23,045 --> 00:14:25,195
Your brother, Suraj, is the only able

207
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,242
man left in the entire village.

208
00:14:36,085 --> 00:14:37,280
Is it safe to take him out

209
00:14:37,445 --> 00:14:38,765
through this small window?

210
00:14:38,925 --> 00:14:40,962
You know we can't take the body

211
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,480
through the main door of a house.

212
00:14:43,965 --> 00:14:45,717
Yes, but if one of us dies

213
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,762
trying to get him cremated,

214
00:14:47,965 --> 00:14:49,114
that won't help either.

215
00:14:49,325 --> 00:14:51,441
Customs exist for a reason, Chandra.

216
00:14:51,645 --> 00:14:53,955
It's not like you Maoists think.

217
00:14:54,205 --> 00:14:58,119
We can't just forget everything.

218
00:15:03,245 --> 00:15:04,599
Donkey boy.

219
00:15:07,565 --> 00:15:10,000
Hey, leave him alone.

220
00:15:10,205 --> 00:15:12,640
I said, leave him alone.

221
00:15:13,405 --> 00:15:14,759
Donkey!

222
00:15:15,725 --> 00:15:17,602
Shobha, any food for this child?

223
00:15:17,765 --> 00:15:19,039
We don't have anything.

224
00:15:19,245 --> 00:15:22,363
You know Durga was upset and left.

225
00:15:25,765 --> 00:15:26,721
Who is he anyway?

226
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:27,960
Doesn't he look like

227
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:29,115
a Photocopy of him?

228
00:15:29,285 --> 00:15:30,241
Who?

229
00:15:30,445 --> 00:15:31,719
Agni sir.

230
00:15:32,005 --> 00:15:32,915
Who's Agni?

231
00:15:35,085 --> 00:15:36,234
You don't know?

232
00:15:36,405 --> 00:15:38,203
Chitra's son, Chandra.

233
00:15:38,365 --> 00:15:39,275
Oh, Chandra?

234
00:15:39,445 --> 00:15:40,355
Yes, Chandra!

235
00:15:40,525 --> 00:15:42,596
Agni is just his Party name.

236
00:15:42,805 --> 00:15:44,762
Aren't you Chandra's son?

237
00:15:48,765 --> 00:15:50,119
Aren't you?

238
00:15:50,525 --> 00:15:51,435
I told you.

239
00:15:51,645 --> 00:15:53,079
I'll see what I can find.

240
00:16:07,805 --> 00:16:10,160
Don't let go of the head yet.

241
00:16:27,085 --> 00:16:29,076
Chandra, come down quickly!

242
00:16:30,005 --> 00:16:31,075
Hurry, hurry!

243
00:16:36,285 --> 00:16:37,844
You two hold the legs.

244
00:16:38,885 --> 00:16:41,798
He's damn heavy!

245
00:16:47,285 --> 00:16:50,437
Place him by the Tulshi plant!

246
00:17:25,165 --> 00:17:26,564
A mine!

247
00:17:33,325 --> 00:17:34,440
Let me see.

248
00:17:34,645 --> 00:17:35,919
Back, get back.

249
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,401
Move further away!

250
00:17:38,685 --> 00:17:39,914
It might blow up.

251
00:17:59,325 --> 00:18:02,078
There's no firing pin.

252
00:18:02,685 --> 00:18:03,755
Don't be afraid.

253
00:18:03,965 --> 00:18:05,524
It won't explode.

254
00:18:45,245 --> 00:18:46,440
Durga's daughter.

255
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:50,002
She looks like her.

256
00:18:56,565 --> 00:18:58,476
Where is Durga? I haven't seen her.

257
00:18:58,685 --> 00:19:01,564
We asked her to stay away.

258
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:03,363
She touched your father's body.

259
00:19:03,565 --> 00:19:05,238
She was probably trying to help.

260
00:19:05,485 --> 00:19:08,557
What? You of all people defend her?

261
00:19:18,845 --> 00:19:20,961
Some groups are demanding seven states,

262
00:19:21,165 --> 00:19:23,076
some are demanding six or eight.

263
00:19:23,285 --> 00:19:25,640
Do you think we will ever

264
00:19:25,805 --> 00:19:27,478
get a Constitution?

265
00:19:27,645 --> 00:19:29,204
You can be damn sure a Constitution

266
00:19:29,405 --> 00:19:30,554
will never be agreed upon.

267
00:19:30,765 --> 00:19:32,483
Where there's a lot of talk,

268
00:19:32,645 --> 00:19:34,318
there is never any action.

269
00:19:36,965 --> 00:19:38,603
So, no Constitution tomorrow?

270
00:19:38,805 --> 00:19:40,523
Not with all these protests.

271
00:19:40,725 --> 00:19:42,636
Suraj, do you know?

272
00:19:42,805 --> 00:19:45,035
I think they will announce it anyway.

273
00:19:45,205 --> 00:19:46,684
I don't believe it.

274
00:19:55,325 --> 00:19:56,998
Look at that rain...

275
00:20:04,205 --> 00:20:06,481
I hope it stops before morning.

276
00:20:06,725 --> 00:20:09,114
It will be difficult to do the procession

277
00:20:09,285 --> 00:20:10,764
to the river during rain.

278
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:23,718
Why are you here?

279
00:20:27,885 --> 00:20:29,080
I came with Chandra.

280
00:20:29,285 --> 00:20:30,275
Why?

281
00:20:34,725 --> 00:20:36,875
He's my father. - No, he's not!

282
00:20:37,085 --> 00:20:38,155
Yes, he is!

283
00:20:38,365 --> 00:20:39,435
No! - Yes!

284
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:42,116
He came from Kathmandu!

285
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:43,281
Yes, me too.

286
00:20:43,445 --> 00:20:45,243
I also come from Kathmandu.

287
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,758
Where is it, then?

288
00:20:54,685 --> 00:20:56,483
Behind that mountain.

289
00:21:07,685 --> 00:21:11,474
I heard how they behaved with you.

290
00:21:12,845 --> 00:21:15,200
We fought a war over things like that.

291
00:21:15,405 --> 00:21:17,521
Our elders will never change.

292
00:21:25,205 --> 00:21:28,004
They would not have even

293
00:21:28,165 --> 00:21:30,520
told me about father.

294
00:21:30,765 --> 00:21:32,676
Thank you.

295
00:21:35,925 --> 00:21:38,394
Well, I wanted to see you, too.

296
00:21:50,445 --> 00:21:53,039
I was hoping you could do me a favor.

297
00:22:01,805 --> 00:22:03,557
You want me to sign this and state

298
00:22:03,725 --> 00:22:05,398
that I am your daughter's father?

299
00:22:05,565 --> 00:22:08,523
Will you? We're moving to Pokhara.

300
00:22:09,765 --> 00:22:11,085
I see.

301
00:22:11,445 --> 00:22:13,436
But why me?

302
00:22:13,725 --> 00:22:15,523
The government requires the father's

303
00:22:15,685 --> 00:22:17,676
signature to issue a birth certificate.

304
00:22:18,245 --> 00:22:20,236
Here, I am still considered

305
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:21,634
your wife, so...

306
00:22:26,325 --> 00:22:28,521
I wouldn't have asked you, Chandra,

307
00:22:28,725 --> 00:22:30,443
but without a birth certificate,

308
00:22:30,645 --> 00:22:32,363
Pooja can't go to school.

309
00:22:32,605 --> 00:22:36,360
Pooja's father won't sign it?

310
00:22:41,565 --> 00:22:44,125
I'm just asking for your signature.

311
00:22:44,365 --> 00:22:45,799
I've done many things for you

312
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:46,921
over the years.

313
00:22:47,085 --> 00:22:48,678
I took care of your father

314
00:22:48,885 --> 00:22:51,081
after you and Suraj left home.

315
00:22:51,885 --> 00:22:53,398
Yes, you did a lot for me.

316
00:22:53,565 --> 00:22:55,556
You gave me another man's daughter.

317
00:22:56,245 --> 00:22:57,280
Many things happened

318
00:22:57,445 --> 00:22:58,640
during the war, Chandra.

319
00:22:58,805 --> 00:23:00,603
You were gone many years.

320
00:23:00,765 --> 00:23:02,085
You don't know what it was

321
00:23:02,245 --> 00:23:03,644
like to survive alone here,

322
00:23:03,805 --> 00:23:05,523
as the wife of a guerrilla.

323
00:23:06,365 --> 00:23:10,916
Can you say you didn't make any mistakes?

324
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,636
We've all heard the rumors.

325
00:23:14,965 --> 00:23:16,797
No children?

326
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:20,483
No children.

327
00:23:36,325 --> 00:23:38,635
Chandra, come play carrom.

328
00:23:38,845 --> 00:23:40,961
We have to pass the night.

329
00:23:41,165 --> 00:23:42,075
Maybe later.

330
00:23:43,085 --> 00:23:44,564
Chandra, what position do you

331
00:23:44,725 --> 00:23:46,204
hold these days with the Party?

332
00:23:46,365 --> 00:23:48,003
We never see you on TV.

333
00:23:49,445 --> 00:23:50,640
You must be in the Party's

334
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:51,954
Central Committee by now.

335
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:54,401
I believe Chandra will be the first person

336
00:23:54,605 --> 00:23:57,279
from our village to become a minister.

337
00:23:57,525 --> 00:23:59,198
I won't become a minister, Uncle.

338
00:23:59,405 --> 00:24:00,634
Why not?

339
00:24:00,805 --> 00:24:04,275
I don't like your Party, you know that.

340
00:24:05,005 --> 00:24:08,441
But you gave up everything for them.

341
00:24:08,925 --> 00:24:10,040
At least our village

342
00:24:10,205 --> 00:24:11,798
could finally be developed.

343
00:24:19,085 --> 00:24:20,803
Tea? - No, thanks.

344
00:24:39,965 --> 00:24:41,603
Chandra, what do you want to do

345
00:24:41,765 --> 00:24:43,278
with your father's belongings?

346
00:24:43,645 --> 00:24:44,840
Shobha...

347
00:24:45,245 --> 00:24:46,724
Could you ask Durga?

348
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:48,398
She will know best.

349
00:24:48,645 --> 00:24:50,158
She said that you and Chandra

350
00:24:50,325 --> 00:24:51,235
should decide.

351
00:25:01,525 --> 00:25:03,721
Chandra, can you come?

352
00:25:10,445 --> 00:25:12,641
It looks good on you.

353
00:25:13,365 --> 00:25:15,720
You can have it, Uncle.

354
00:25:16,085 --> 00:25:18,122
If it's okay with Suraj.

355
00:25:18,845 --> 00:25:20,074
Really?

356
00:25:23,005 --> 00:25:27,681
Your father had good taste.

357
00:25:29,525 --> 00:25:32,324
Kaji, this will be useful for you.

358
00:25:32,485 --> 00:25:33,395
Take this.

359
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:36,125
Chandra, have you seen the land deed?

360
00:26:06,925 --> 00:26:09,041
Were you married to him?

361
00:26:14,645 --> 00:26:16,955
Tell me, were you married?

362
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:23,923
Long ago.

363
00:26:25,005 --> 00:26:26,723
Many years ago.

364
00:26:27,605 --> 00:26:29,516
But, he isn't your father.

365
00:26:29,885 --> 00:26:31,034
If you were married,

366
00:26:31,205 --> 00:26:32,957
how can he not be my father?

367
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:37,478
Please tell me mother.

368
00:26:37,925 --> 00:26:41,077
Pooja, let's go to sleep, please.

369
00:26:41,445 --> 00:26:43,118
We have a lot more packing

370
00:26:43,285 --> 00:26:44,241
to do tomorrow.

371
00:26:59,445 --> 00:27:01,197
Three demonstrators

372
00:27:01,365 --> 00:27:04,323
have been shot dead in clashes

373
00:27:04,525 --> 00:27:08,200
with police in Mahotari district...

374
00:27:10,405 --> 00:27:12,123
According to eyewitnesses

375
00:27:12,285 --> 00:27:13,684
police fired teargas

376
00:27:13,885 --> 00:27:16,161
and live rounds into the crowds

377
00:27:16,325 --> 00:27:17,440
at the event...

378
00:27:17,765 --> 00:27:18,721
Thirty bystanders,

379
00:27:18,885 --> 00:27:20,159
among them many children,

380
00:27:20,325 --> 00:27:21,645
were wounded while trying

381
00:27:21,805 --> 00:27:22,795
to flee the scene.

382
00:27:23,005 --> 00:27:26,885
The death toll is expected to rise.

383
00:27:27,525 --> 00:27:29,994
Meanwhile two journalists had

384
00:27:30,165 --> 00:27:32,998
their cameras smashed by police.

385
00:28:29,885 --> 00:28:30,795
And?

386
00:28:31,805 --> 00:28:33,955
I told him I would think about it.

387
00:28:34,285 --> 00:28:35,514
You're telling me,

388
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:37,234
you can find no one

389
00:28:37,405 --> 00:28:39,078
but my brother to marry?

390
00:28:39,645 --> 00:28:41,363
Is he Pooja's father?

391
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,682
You're asking me now?

392
00:28:46,405 --> 00:28:47,554
I was your husband.

393
00:28:47,765 --> 00:28:50,041
Even though you are lower caste,

394
00:28:50,245 --> 00:28:52,964
I fought with everyone to marry you.

395
00:28:55,485 --> 00:28:56,759
Do you know how long

396
00:28:56,925 --> 00:28:58,245
you were lost to us?

397
00:28:59,365 --> 00:29:01,436
But no, Suraj is not her father.

398
00:29:10,525 --> 00:29:12,641
If you're asking why I would get married,

399
00:29:12,805 --> 00:29:14,842
I'm not interested in marriage.

400
00:29:22,885 --> 00:29:24,796
Why should I be interested in marriage?

401
00:29:24,965 --> 00:29:27,400
I've been on my own for so long already.

402
00:29:32,005 --> 00:29:33,518
Chandra, sir?

403
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:35,684
Agni, sir?

404
00:29:35,885 --> 00:29:39,116
Everyone is looking for you.

405
00:29:39,805 --> 00:29:41,364
It's time for the procession.

406
00:29:41,565 --> 00:29:43,920
Can you tell them I'll be coming shortly?

407
00:29:44,085 --> 00:29:45,405
I wasn't planning to go back.

408
00:29:45,605 --> 00:29:46,561
I've got a lot to do.

409
00:29:46,765 --> 00:29:48,756
You'll have to tell them yourself.

410
00:29:58,925 --> 00:29:59,995
So why my brother?

411
00:30:01,725 --> 00:30:03,363
Pooja needs a paternity certificate.

412
00:30:03,565 --> 00:30:04,794
Who will sign the papers?

413
00:30:05,005 --> 00:30:07,360
Would you sign as her father?

414
00:30:10,205 --> 00:30:12,276
Then it's none of your business

415
00:30:12,445 --> 00:30:13,401
if I marry.

416
00:30:48,685 --> 00:30:49,914
Take off your shoes.

417
00:31:03,165 --> 00:31:04,883
Come here.

418
00:31:13,485 --> 00:31:15,044
Hold out your hand.

419
00:31:16,645 --> 00:31:18,079
Both.

420
00:31:26,925 --> 00:31:28,484
Okay, put it down here.

421
00:31:34,085 --> 00:31:36,042
Now you can carry.

422
00:31:43,525 --> 00:31:44,640
Oh, wait!

423
00:31:45,965 --> 00:31:47,603
Wait, I forgot something!

424
00:31:54,285 --> 00:31:56,003
I almost forgot.

425
00:31:59,645 --> 00:32:00,999
What's the idea?

426
00:32:01,445 --> 00:32:02,594
It was Father's wish.

427
00:32:07,965 --> 00:32:10,115
Your father supported the King

428
00:32:10,285 --> 00:32:11,355
his whole life.

429
00:32:11,685 --> 00:32:13,437
You're joking.

430
00:32:15,405 --> 00:32:16,759
This is too much.

431
00:32:17,445 --> 00:32:18,674
Pick it up.

432
00:32:21,645 --> 00:32:22,555
Pick it up.

433
00:32:22,765 --> 00:32:24,836
I gave everything for this struggle.

434
00:32:25,045 --> 00:32:27,355
Father and I didn't agree about politics,

435
00:32:27,525 --> 00:32:28,720
but I didn't come back here

436
00:32:28,885 --> 00:32:30,034
to be treated like this.

437
00:32:30,205 --> 00:32:31,878
Don't be ridiculous!

438
00:32:44,085 --> 00:32:46,474
Pick him up now. Enough of this!

439
00:32:51,685 --> 00:32:52,959
Chandra?

440
00:34:12,245 --> 00:34:14,600
Didn't I tell you to stay here?

441
00:34:15,205 --> 00:34:16,923
Didn't I tell you women

442
00:34:17,085 --> 00:34:19,395
aren't allowed at the funeral?

443
00:34:28,925 --> 00:34:30,324
Slowly, slowly...

444
00:35:08,645 --> 00:35:09,919
Slower...

445
00:35:11,805 --> 00:35:13,682
Wait, wait!

446
00:35:26,805 --> 00:35:28,443
I said wait!

447
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,756
Slow down,

448
00:35:41,325 --> 00:35:43,396
and you might appreciate the beautiful

449
00:35:43,565 --> 00:35:45,397
country your Party tried to ruin.

450
00:35:51,085 --> 00:35:54,237
For two centuries, just one caste

451
00:35:54,405 --> 00:35:57,318
has been ruling this country.

452
00:35:58,565 --> 00:35:59,999
Is it wrong for people

453
00:36:00,165 --> 00:36:01,599
to ?ght for justice?

454
00:36:01,965 --> 00:36:05,196
Show some respect for the dead, please!

455
00:36:07,525 --> 00:36:08,924
Shame!

456
00:36:10,965 --> 00:36:16,085
I've seen the results of your "justice"

457
00:36:17,125 --> 00:36:19,002
in my clinic every day.

458
00:36:25,085 --> 00:36:29,602
There's no peace without justice...

459
00:36:29,845 --> 00:36:32,883
What's wrong with you two!

460
00:36:33,085 --> 00:36:34,314
How can they argue

461
00:36:34,485 --> 00:36:36,158
during the procession!

462
00:36:46,525 --> 00:36:49,244
I came back here to help

463
00:36:49,405 --> 00:36:51,794
after the war ended,

464
00:36:52,045 --> 00:36:53,444
what have you been doing?

465
00:36:53,605 --> 00:36:56,040
We have to think about the whole country,

466
00:36:56,245 --> 00:36:57,599
not just one village.

467
00:36:57,765 --> 00:36:58,994
Brother, you can't even

468
00:36:59,165 --> 00:37:00,599
take care of your own family.

469
00:37:00,805 --> 00:37:02,364
You're such a disaster!

470
00:37:04,165 --> 00:37:05,758
Ten years. What have

471
00:37:05,925 --> 00:37:07,836
you got to show for it?

472
00:37:08,645 --> 00:37:11,842
You think you're the man for Durga?

473
00:37:13,005 --> 00:37:14,757
You know she's only marrying you

474
00:37:14,925 --> 00:37:16,757
so you sign some papers for her.

475
00:37:17,125 --> 00:37:19,355
You just can't accept defeat!

476
00:37:20,965 --> 00:37:22,603
How could you put the body down

477
00:37:22,765 --> 00:37:24,199
before the river? It's a sin!

478
00:37:24,365 --> 00:37:25,275
Are you crazy! ?

479
00:37:25,445 --> 00:37:26,480
What are you doing?

480
00:37:28,205 --> 00:37:29,718
I said, stop fighting!

481
00:37:33,365 --> 00:37:34,878
What have you done?

482
00:37:35,085 --> 00:37:36,359
You're fighting with your

483
00:37:36,525 --> 00:37:38,118
dead father on your shoulders!

484
00:37:39,565 --> 00:37:40,760
Where are you going?

485
00:37:41,685 --> 00:37:43,084
Where're you going!

486
00:37:44,965 --> 00:37:45,955
Chandra...

487
00:37:46,685 --> 00:37:48,323
what did you just do?

488
00:37:49,045 --> 00:37:50,638
Now who's going to carry

489
00:37:50,805 --> 00:37:52,364
the body to the river?

490
00:37:53,405 --> 00:37:55,316
We'll do it.

491
00:37:56,365 --> 00:37:58,720
Oh, God! Why did I live to see this day!

492
00:38:00,365 --> 00:38:03,756
Chandra, go bring Suraj back.

493
00:38:04,725 --> 00:38:07,956
None of us can help carry your father.

494
00:38:11,645 --> 00:38:13,636
Bring Suraj back.

495
00:38:14,285 --> 00:38:15,764
How can you suggest that

496
00:38:15,925 --> 00:38:17,757
after what he's done, Uncle?

497
00:38:19,365 --> 00:38:21,242
Wait for me here.

498
00:38:23,765 --> 00:38:25,802
I'll find someone else.

499
00:39:47,045 --> 00:39:48,365
Houses look different

500
00:39:48,525 --> 00:39:50,596
when they're empty, don't they?

501
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:53,365
Yes, I feel like a ghost.

502
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:57,439
I'm looking for the police station.

503
00:39:57,605 --> 00:39:58,561
Is it gone?

504
00:39:58,765 --> 00:40:00,438
They moved it across the river.

505
00:40:00,685 --> 00:40:02,198
Ah, okay, that's why.

506
00:40:03,805 --> 00:40:05,523
Okay, I'll go there.

507
00:40:06,925 --> 00:40:08,438
This man was village

508
00:40:08,605 --> 00:40:10,164
Chairman for 12 years.

509
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:11,724
Look at him today.

510
00:40:11,925 --> 00:40:13,324
Lying in a ditch!

511
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:17,205
You think we will have

512
00:40:17,365 --> 00:40:20,244
better deaths ourselves?

513
00:40:23,645 --> 00:40:27,843
My son would never abandon me like this!

514
00:40:28,045 --> 00:40:31,640
Don't be too confident!

515
00:40:32,285 --> 00:40:34,481
You will smell like a dead rat

516
00:40:34,685 --> 00:40:37,325
long before he comes from America!

517
00:40:40,845 --> 00:40:42,882
Believe it or not, that's the truth.

518
00:40:43,165 --> 00:40:45,805
He's right, you know...

519
00:40:48,325 --> 00:40:50,601
Take my example.

520
00:40:50,845 --> 00:40:53,234
I have seven children,

521
00:40:53,485 --> 00:40:56,318
but none at home.

522
00:40:58,525 --> 00:41:01,324
There isn't a single one

523
00:41:01,565 --> 00:41:04,364
who could even offer me

524
00:41:04,525 --> 00:41:08,564
a glass of water if I fell sick.

525
00:41:10,045 --> 00:41:15,643
I feel terrified, when I think about it.

526
00:41:16,525 --> 00:41:18,118
I could have an even

527
00:41:18,285 --> 00:41:20,162
worse death than Chitra.

528
00:41:21,965 --> 00:41:24,161
Death is the last truth.

529
00:41:43,645 --> 00:41:44,760
Pooja...

530
00:41:45,165 --> 00:41:47,042
What are you doing up there?

531
00:41:47,285 --> 00:41:49,003
Nothing.

532
00:41:49,605 --> 00:41:52,165
I don't want you playing up there!

533
00:41:53,885 --> 00:41:56,798
What did you take out? - Nothing.

534
00:41:59,485 --> 00:42:01,123
What is that in your hand?

535
00:42:02,085 --> 00:42:03,314
Nothing.

536
00:42:03,645 --> 00:42:04,999
Come here!

537
00:42:27,485 --> 00:42:30,159
Hey, what are you doing there?

538
00:42:47,645 --> 00:42:50,000
They burned the old bridge.

539
00:42:50,205 --> 00:42:53,004
Why are you here? Go home!

540
00:42:53,725 --> 00:42:55,238
Don't you want me to show you

541
00:42:55,405 --> 00:42:56,554
where the new one is?

542
00:43:19,405 --> 00:43:21,965
Okay, you both return now.

543
00:43:23,125 --> 00:43:25,241
I can find my way from here alone.

544
00:43:27,125 --> 00:43:28,718
Go back.

545
00:43:33,405 --> 00:43:35,555
Didn't you hear me?

546
00:44:14,645 --> 00:44:16,079
I will go first.

547
00:44:16,845 --> 00:44:18,074
Then hurry.

548
00:44:45,645 --> 00:44:47,363
Hey, what're you doing?

549
00:44:47,765 --> 00:44:48,755
Hey!

550
00:44:49,845 --> 00:44:51,438
Don't tie it!

551
00:44:53,365 --> 00:44:55,003
Why are you tying that?

552
00:44:56,605 --> 00:44:58,357
I want to come, too!

553
00:44:59,245 --> 00:45:01,122
Stupid! Why'd you tie it?

554
00:45:20,285 --> 00:45:22,083
Are you my father?

555
00:45:24,605 --> 00:45:25,879
Who told you that?

556
00:45:26,605 --> 00:45:28,403
Did your mother tell you that?

557
00:45:28,725 --> 00:45:30,875
Some people said you might be.

558
00:45:31,685 --> 00:45:33,403
No, I'm not your father.

559
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:36,524
Isn't this you?

560
00:45:43,525 --> 00:45:44,481
No, that's not me.

561
00:45:44,685 --> 00:45:46,084
That's my cousin.

562
00:45:47,725 --> 00:45:49,238
I am your uncle.

563
00:45:49,445 --> 00:45:51,197
It's just our faces are similar.

564
00:45:51,405 --> 00:45:52,315
Uncle?

565
00:45:53,325 --> 00:45:55,555
Didn't you come from Kathmandu?

566
00:45:55,925 --> 00:45:58,201
My father also lives in Kathmandu.

567
00:46:02,005 --> 00:46:03,757
Kathmandu is a big city.

568
00:46:03,965 --> 00:46:05,876
Your father, me, there are

569
00:46:06,045 --> 00:46:07,922
many people in Kathmandu.

570
00:46:09,565 --> 00:46:11,283
Why doesn't my father visit us?

571
00:46:11,445 --> 00:46:12,958
I really want to meet him.

572
00:46:15,325 --> 00:46:17,635
Well, he is very poor.

573
00:46:18,605 --> 00:46:19,720
To visit the village,

574
00:46:19,885 --> 00:46:20,955
he would need money.

575
00:46:21,165 --> 00:46:22,838
Once he has money, he will come.

576
00:46:23,005 --> 00:46:24,404
You'll understand one day.

577
00:46:24,565 --> 00:46:26,238
But my mother said

578
00:46:26,405 --> 00:46:28,635
my father is fighting

579
00:46:28,845 --> 00:46:33,635
for the rights of us lower caste.

580
00:46:33,845 --> 00:46:35,074
She did?

581
00:46:37,285 --> 00:46:39,595
What else did she say?

582
00:47:14,325 --> 00:47:17,363
I don't know why you wanted him here.

583
00:47:17,605 --> 00:47:19,562
What? Who said I wanted him here?

584
00:47:19,765 --> 00:47:21,483
You can't cremate your father

585
00:47:21,685 --> 00:47:23,835
without telling your brother, Suraj?

586
00:47:24,045 --> 00:47:25,240
Well, he's completely

587
00:47:25,405 --> 00:47:26,759
messed up the funeral.

588
00:47:28,285 --> 00:47:29,639
We'll see who he can find

589
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:31,079
to help carry father now.

590
00:47:31,485 --> 00:47:32,964
If you care about father,

591
00:47:34,245 --> 00:47:35,565
you should help.

592
00:47:35,805 --> 00:47:37,716
You're both being ridiculous.

593
00:47:43,565 --> 00:47:44,714
What is this?

594
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:50,559
Oh, those. I need your signature.

595
00:47:54,965 --> 00:47:57,275
So it's true what Chandra says.

596
00:47:59,605 --> 00:48:03,041
Who was it that wanted to get married?

597
00:48:05,405 --> 00:48:07,681
You know my daughter.

598
00:48:10,325 --> 00:48:13,238
I've always been honest with you

599
00:48:13,405 --> 00:48:15,078
about my feelings.

600
00:48:17,685 --> 00:48:19,995
You're only marrying me for this?

601
00:48:21,525 --> 00:48:23,801
Suraj, you're a good man.

602
00:48:25,005 --> 00:48:26,882
But I need to know that if we marry,

603
00:48:27,085 --> 00:48:28,280
you will recognize Pooja

604
00:48:28,445 --> 00:48:29,355
as your daughter.

605
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:44,398
Wait here while I go talk to the police.

606
00:48:46,365 --> 00:48:49,084
Sister? Sister?

607
00:48:53,285 --> 00:48:54,480
Sit here.

608
00:48:54,685 --> 00:48:57,359
If she wakes up, you can order a snack.

609
00:48:57,605 --> 00:48:59,198
I'll be back soon.

610
00:49:43,565 --> 00:49:45,602
Why don't you like me?

611
00:50:22,965 --> 00:50:25,081
What do you want?

612
00:50:25,325 --> 00:50:26,235
Dumplings.

613
00:50:26,445 --> 00:50:28,197
Do you have money to pay for it?

614
00:50:32,445 --> 00:50:33,879
Okay, wait.

615
00:50:38,485 --> 00:50:41,318
RAMPUR POLICE STATION

616
00:50:41,565 --> 00:50:43,920
So, you're Chitra's son?

617
00:50:45,045 --> 00:50:46,843
The district leader of the King's Party?

618
00:50:47,005 --> 00:50:47,915
Yes, he was in

619
00:50:48,085 --> 00:50:49,564
the National Democratic Party.

620
00:50:49,725 --> 00:50:51,477
You're the son of Chitra's wife?

621
00:50:51,645 --> 00:50:53,716
You don't look like either of them.

622
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:55,598
No, another woman.

623
00:50:55,805 --> 00:50:58,399
I never saw you here before?

624
00:50:59,245 --> 00:51:01,122
I was away.

625
00:51:01,645 --> 00:51:03,044
Away?

626
00:51:03,725 --> 00:51:06,035
I was in PLA (People's Liberation Army).

627
00:51:08,205 --> 00:51:11,914
Look, we're here to serve citizens...

628
00:51:12,485 --> 00:51:16,080
but your village isn't in our district.

629
00:51:16,725 --> 00:51:18,204
Who's winning?

630
00:51:18,445 --> 00:51:20,243
Nepal is losing.

631
00:51:20,405 --> 00:51:24,160
But the other station is two days walk.

632
00:51:24,485 --> 00:51:26,158
We didn't set the locations

633
00:51:26,325 --> 00:51:27,360
of the stations.

634
00:51:27,565 --> 00:51:28,760
Are you selling?

635
00:51:29,005 --> 00:51:32,964
Can't you help me as a neighbor?

636
00:51:34,125 --> 00:51:35,684
How much do you want for it?

637
00:51:36,005 --> 00:51:38,724
It's been too many days already.

638
00:51:38,885 --> 00:51:41,081
What? Are you trying to rob the police?

639
00:51:41,245 --> 00:51:43,361
It's a chicken, not a goat.

640
00:51:43,525 --> 00:51:45,914
Why not bury him?

641
00:51:46,125 --> 00:51:47,559
I thought you progressives

642
00:51:47,725 --> 00:51:49,762
didn't believe in the old rituals.

643
00:51:49,965 --> 00:51:53,276
Both sides buried people during the war.

644
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:55,123
We also buried people

645
00:51:55,285 --> 00:51:57,561
after the earthquake, but...

646
00:52:01,685 --> 00:52:02,641
Do you see smoke

647
00:52:02,805 --> 00:52:04,478
coming out of the mountain there?

648
00:52:04,685 --> 00:52:06,642
Your former comrades are there.

649
00:52:06,845 --> 00:52:08,722
Why not ask them?

650
00:52:09,725 --> 00:52:10,874
You know since they split

651
00:52:11,045 --> 00:52:11,955
from the Maoists,

652
00:52:12,125 --> 00:52:13,798
they would see me as an enemy.

653
00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:16,883
They sit up there dreaming one day

654
00:52:17,045 --> 00:52:18,080
they will win the war

655
00:52:18,245 --> 00:52:19,474
with their broken rifles.

656
00:52:19,645 --> 00:52:21,636
How is it that you know where they are

657
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:23,443
but don't arrest them?

658
00:52:23,845 --> 00:52:25,722
What did you say your name was?

659
00:52:26,405 --> 00:52:28,282
Agni. - Look, Agni...

660
00:52:28,525 --> 00:52:31,483
We're not as free as you might think.

661
00:52:32,365 --> 00:52:34,322
We're very busy you know.

662
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:36,837
As long as they stay up there,

663
00:52:37,005 --> 00:52:38,200
we don't fight them.

664
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:40,442
And you know how bad things

665
00:52:40,605 --> 00:52:42,562
are after the earthquake.

666
00:52:44,605 --> 00:52:48,997
Say hello to your brother Suraj for me.

667
00:53:47,365 --> 00:53:49,402
Come under the tarp.

668
00:53:49,685 --> 00:53:52,677
Make sure you don't touch the body.

669
00:53:53,005 --> 00:53:54,439
You elders come inside.

670
00:53:54,765 --> 00:53:55,800
No, they should stay

671
00:53:55,965 --> 00:53:57,399
on that side of the wall.

672
00:54:19,725 --> 00:54:21,363
Can we take the path?

673
00:54:22,085 --> 00:54:23,678
Go around that way.

674
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:49,923
Sir, whose wedding is this?

675
00:54:50,085 --> 00:54:51,359
Bhim Daha
's son, Jit.

676
00:54:51,525 --> 00:54:53,482
The Assembly Member? - Yes, that's him.

677
00:54:53,645 --> 00:54:55,716
You mean the Maoist leader? - Right.

678
00:54:56,285 --> 00:54:57,923
I know the groom's father.

679
00:54:58,365 --> 00:54:59,639
He was my commander.

680
00:55:12,965 --> 00:55:14,239
Excuse me, do you know

681
00:55:14,405 --> 00:55:15,600
where comrade Bhim is?

682
00:55:15,765 --> 00:55:16,994
Ask in there.

683
00:55:41,405 --> 00:55:42,964
Excuse me, do you know

684
00:55:43,125 --> 00:55:44,798
where Comrade Bhim is?

685
00:55:45,005 --> 00:55:46,075
He is coming.

686
00:55:46,285 --> 00:55:48,322
He will be arriving soon.

687
00:56:43,605 --> 00:56:45,323
Comrade Bhim! Lal Salam!

688
00:56:45,925 --> 00:56:48,235
Comrade Agni, Lal Salam!

689
00:56:48,445 --> 00:56:49,765
I don't believe it!

690
00:56:50,725 --> 00:56:52,523
Old sayings are not wrong, are they?

691
00:56:52,725 --> 00:56:54,318
God says, "If you wish for it,

692
00:56:54,485 --> 00:56:55,441
I will manage it."

693
00:56:55,645 --> 00:56:57,443
I was just thinking about you,

694
00:56:57,645 --> 00:56:59,318
and here you are waiting for me.

695
00:57:00,205 --> 00:57:02,082
I need to ask you a favour.

696
00:57:02,245 --> 00:57:03,599
Of course, anything!

697
00:57:05,205 --> 00:57:06,161
Congratulations to you

698
00:57:06,325 --> 00:57:07,315
on your son's marriage.

699
00:57:07,485 --> 00:57:09,123
Thank you. - It's a long time

700
00:57:09,285 --> 00:57:10,639
since you visited our district.

701
00:57:10,805 --> 00:57:12,523
Look, the President is announcing

702
00:57:12,685 --> 00:57:13,755
the Constitution today

703
00:57:13,965 --> 00:57:16,320
I just came for the wedding,

704
00:57:16,485 --> 00:57:18,396
but I can't stay long.

705
00:57:18,605 --> 00:57:20,755
Once the Constitution is put forth,

706
00:57:20,925 --> 00:57:23,235
then everything will fall into place.

707
00:57:35,765 --> 00:57:38,075
Comrade Agni, come join us.

708
00:57:38,285 --> 00:57:40,401
I should introduce you to my son.

709
00:57:40,605 --> 00:57:41,925
I need a moment with you.

710
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,843
We will talk.

711
00:57:44,045 --> 00:57:45,718
Are they your children?

712
00:57:45,925 --> 00:57:47,120
It's urgent.

713
00:57:47,285 --> 00:57:48,639
We will talk, we will talk.

714
00:57:48,845 --> 00:57:50,563
Don't judge my politics by this.

715
00:57:50,765 --> 00:57:53,041
The kids wanted a traditional marriage,

716
00:57:53,245 --> 00:57:54,963
I'm still one of you.

717
00:57:55,325 --> 00:57:56,998
There's my son, Jit,

718
00:57:57,165 --> 00:57:58,917
and daughter-in-law.

719
00:57:59,285 --> 00:58:01,720
Jit, look who is here.

720
00:58:02,165 --> 00:58:03,314
Comrade Agni.

721
00:58:04,245 --> 00:58:05,963
You must remember him,

722
00:58:06,165 --> 00:58:08,315
I used to tell you about him.

723
00:58:08,525 --> 00:58:09,481
Yes, he's famous.

724
00:58:12,885 --> 00:58:14,558
If we have a Republic today,

725
00:58:14,765 --> 00:58:17,644
and are enjoying democracy,

726
00:58:18,285 --> 00:58:19,559
it is because of Agni

727
00:58:19,725 --> 00:58:20,795
and the comrades.

728
00:58:22,445 --> 00:58:25,324
I need a moment with you.

729
00:58:25,805 --> 00:58:26,840
Of course!

730
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:28,160
I need to ask a favor.

731
00:58:28,325 --> 00:58:29,804
Of course, of course.

732
00:58:30,005 --> 00:58:31,518
Anything you need.

733
00:58:32,725 --> 00:58:33,635
It's no trouble.

734
00:58:33,805 --> 00:58:34,840
Anything you need.

735
00:58:49,685 --> 00:58:52,074
Look, this is an auspicious moment.

736
00:58:52,285 --> 00:58:54,083
You know it's unlucky for us

737
00:58:54,245 --> 00:58:55,997
to have bad news this day.

738
00:58:56,925 --> 00:59:01,556
I would be angry if it wasn't you, Agni.

739
00:59:02,605 --> 00:59:04,835
My father has lain dead

740
00:59:05,005 --> 00:59:06,882
for three days now.

741
00:59:10,285 --> 00:59:11,195
What?

742
00:59:11,525 --> 00:59:14,563
You're needed for the ceremony.

743
00:59:14,805 --> 00:59:18,241
Okay, I will be there shortly.

744
00:59:19,565 --> 00:59:21,556
Uncle? Uncle? - What?

745
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:23,682
Why didn't you let us eat at the wedding?

746
00:59:23,885 --> 00:59:25,523
Didn't you eat at the tea shop?

747
00:59:25,685 --> 00:59:27,164
Yes. - So?

748
00:59:27,365 --> 00:59:29,834
But it was nice there at the wedding,

749
00:59:30,005 --> 00:59:31,484
with all those people.

750
00:59:31,725 --> 00:59:33,682
The food looked delicious.

751
00:59:33,885 --> 00:59:35,364
Selfish people!

752
00:59:36,085 --> 00:59:38,122
People you risked your life for!

753
00:59:38,405 --> 00:59:39,554
If it wasn't for me,

754
00:59:39,725 --> 00:59:41,716
he wouldn't be alive to celebrate.

755
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:43,963
Are you in the Nepal army?

756
00:59:46,285 --> 00:59:47,764
No, I am not in the army.

757
00:59:48,045 --> 00:59:49,877
The groom's father you just met,

758
00:59:50,125 --> 00:59:52,480
I saved his life from the Nepal army.

759
00:59:52,725 --> 00:59:55,922
Don't you know? Uncle is a Maoist!

760
00:59:56,845 --> 00:59:59,280
He fights to make a new Nepal.

761
01:00:00,005 --> 01:00:02,201
Did you kill my parents?

762
01:00:06,765 --> 01:00:08,438
Didn't you say he is your father?

763
01:00:08,645 --> 01:00:10,602
Why would I kill your parents?

764
01:00:10,805 --> 01:00:13,035
Aren't you a Maoist? - I am.

765
01:00:13,205 --> 01:00:15,037
Maoists killed my parents.

766
01:00:15,365 --> 01:00:16,878
But I didn't kill them.

767
01:00:33,325 --> 01:00:34,474
Come here.

768
01:00:34,685 --> 01:00:36,164
I'll kill you, too.

769
01:00:37,965 --> 01:00:39,524
Pooja! It's okay, leave him.

770
01:00:41,525 --> 01:00:44,995
I'll cut you! I'll kill you!

771
01:00:49,925 --> 01:00:51,563
You want to beat me?

772
01:00:51,725 --> 01:00:52,920
Okay, beat me.

773
01:00:58,285 --> 01:01:01,038
Badri, listen, forgive me.

774
01:01:03,365 --> 01:01:05,117
There was so much killing

775
01:01:05,285 --> 01:01:06,355
during the war.

776
01:01:06,605 --> 01:01:08,516
It's not just your parents.

777
01:01:11,725 --> 01:01:13,159
I'm sorry for what happened

778
01:01:13,325 --> 01:01:14,918
to your parents, I'm sorry...

779
01:01:15,165 --> 01:01:17,202
Look at me.

780
01:01:27,125 --> 01:01:29,799
No, Pooja, let him.

781
01:01:39,485 --> 01:01:41,715
You killed my parents!

782
01:01:42,565 --> 01:01:45,717
You want to hurt me?

783
01:01:45,925 --> 01:01:47,962
I understand.

784
01:02:11,725 --> 01:02:12,920
Respected ones,

785
01:02:13,085 --> 01:02:15,520
why are you here in the road?

786
01:02:16,805 --> 01:02:18,478
Can't you see?

787
01:02:18,845 --> 01:02:20,597
Oh my!

788
01:02:21,365 --> 01:02:22,719
Who is it?

789
01:02:23,165 --> 01:02:24,883
Do you know Chitra Bikram Thapa

790
01:02:25,045 --> 01:02:25,955
from Nepaltra?

791
01:02:26,125 --> 01:02:27,035
Yes, I do.

792
01:02:27,205 --> 01:02:28,878
The former village Chairman.

793
01:02:29,125 --> 01:02:30,843
This is him.

794
01:02:31,045 --> 01:02:33,195
Oh, he was supposed to buy

795
01:02:33,365 --> 01:02:34,924
some pots from me.

796
01:02:35,245 --> 01:02:38,283
How did he happen to die here?

797
01:02:40,085 --> 01:02:42,122
He didn't die here.

798
01:02:42,325 --> 01:02:43,554
Why are you keeping him

799
01:02:43,725 --> 01:02:44,920
in the road here then?

800
01:02:46,045 --> 01:02:50,278
We're too old to carry him.

801
01:02:52,725 --> 01:02:54,921
I'm old, I carry all these pots.

802
01:02:55,085 --> 01:02:56,314
Can you let me pass?

803
01:02:56,485 --> 01:02:57,441
You lower caste

804
01:02:57,645 --> 01:02:58,874
can't walk by the body.

805
01:02:59,085 --> 01:03:00,723
Go the other way.

806
01:03:02,045 --> 01:03:03,763
You want me to climb the mountain?

807
01:03:03,965 --> 01:03:05,399
This is my road.

808
01:03:05,605 --> 01:03:07,755
Don't be so stupid.

809
01:03:08,645 --> 01:03:10,522
Don't you see there is a dead body,

810
01:03:10,685 --> 01:03:11,641
go the other way.

811
01:03:11,805 --> 01:03:13,716
Okay, I'm the one who's stupid,

812
01:03:13,885 --> 01:03:14,795
I'm going.

813
01:03:18,525 --> 01:03:21,119
The war really changed these people.

814
01:03:57,525 --> 01:03:59,163
Uncle Suraj?

815
01:04:00,085 --> 01:04:02,235
Please open the door.

816
01:04:13,965 --> 01:04:16,081
Please open the door.

817
01:04:25,565 --> 01:04:27,795
MEDICAL CLINIC

818
01:04:37,165 --> 01:04:38,314
Come.

819
01:04:38,605 --> 01:04:40,198
Let me talk to you.

820
01:04:42,365 --> 01:04:44,038
I want to apologize.

821
01:04:44,765 --> 01:04:45,800
You were right.

822
01:05:31,045 --> 01:05:32,080
She's not here.

823
01:05:32,245 --> 01:05:34,122
Let's go to grandfather's.

824
01:05:34,605 --> 01:05:36,039
You guys go ahead.

825
01:05:37,325 --> 01:05:39,316
I'll follow you shortly.

826
01:06:26,405 --> 01:06:28,396
You couldn't have picked a worse day

827
01:06:28,565 --> 01:06:29,635
to ask for my help.

828
01:06:32,445 --> 01:06:34,356
They did it.

829
01:06:34,925 --> 01:06:37,997
For the ?rst time in Nepal's history

830
01:06:38,205 --> 01:06:39,798
the people will have

831
01:06:39,965 --> 01:06:41,638
a written Constitution

832
01:06:41,845 --> 01:06:43,438
that is passed by their

833
01:06:43,605 --> 01:06:45,243
elected representatives.

834
01:06:45,445 --> 01:06:47,641
Today, President Ram Baran Yadab

835
01:06:47,805 --> 01:06:50,638
will sign and announce the Constitution,

836
01:06:50,845 --> 01:06:54,600
during the Assembly's last meeting.

837
01:06:54,805 --> 01:06:57,274
With this, Nepal will formally become

838
01:06:57,445 --> 01:06:58,719
a Federal Republic,

839
01:06:58,925 --> 01:07:01,519
and ?nally the peace process

840
01:07:01,685 --> 01:07:03,517
will be concluded...

841
01:07:08,925 --> 01:07:10,563
Finally we will have

842
01:07:10,725 --> 01:07:12,557
the Constitution today?

843
01:07:12,765 --> 01:07:14,676
Looks like it.

844
01:07:14,885 --> 01:07:16,683
That's really good news.

845
01:07:17,765 --> 01:07:19,278
This is great...

846
01:07:49,285 --> 01:07:53,802
Seems like I'm catching a cold out here!

847
01:07:54,005 --> 01:07:56,918
Warmth is the best medicine.

848
01:08:01,965 --> 01:08:03,842
Put it on top here.

849
01:08:15,005 --> 01:08:19,124
Are you making a ?re?

850
01:08:19,445 --> 01:08:21,834
It's getting dark and cold.

851
01:08:22,005 --> 01:08:23,916
Why should we suffer?

852
01:08:24,125 --> 01:08:27,755
Also, it will keep the ghosts away.

853
01:08:27,965 --> 01:08:30,195
I'm not thinking about ghosts.

854
01:08:31,165 --> 01:08:33,361
Sir, look...

855
01:08:36,965 --> 01:08:39,764
What the hell are they doing here?

856
01:08:42,005 --> 01:08:43,916
Durga brought these guerrillas

857
01:08:44,085 --> 01:08:45,598
to carry Chitra's body?

858
01:08:47,205 --> 01:08:49,401
Do we have a choice?

859
01:08:49,645 --> 01:08:52,922
Isn't it better than letting the body rot?

860
01:08:54,285 --> 01:08:55,639
He is right.

861
01:08:56,405 --> 01:08:57,361
It's better.

862
01:09:00,525 --> 01:09:01,754
Where's Chandra?

863
01:09:03,325 --> 01:09:04,395
Greetings.

864
01:09:08,285 --> 01:09:10,003
The body is there.

865
01:09:10,765 --> 01:09:12,483
I've never seen anything

866
01:09:12,645 --> 01:09:14,238
like this in my life.

867
01:09:15,885 --> 01:09:17,478
Boy, where's Chandra?

868
01:09:17,845 --> 01:09:20,485
He's preparing food for everyone.

869
01:09:20,965 --> 01:09:22,683
He is cooking? Chandra?

870
01:09:23,925 --> 01:09:25,757
Durga, the body is smelling.

871
01:09:26,005 --> 01:09:27,279
Let's go to the river.

872
01:09:27,525 --> 01:09:28,959
He is here.

873
01:09:34,365 --> 01:09:36,242
Long live the Revolution, comrade!

874
01:09:36,485 --> 01:09:38,795
Long live the Revolution!

875
01:10:01,765 --> 01:10:04,075
Long live the Revolution, comrade!

876
01:10:07,845 --> 01:10:09,518
Long time, comrade!

877
01:10:09,765 --> 01:10:12,359
We meet again, Kumar.

878
01:10:12,685 --> 01:10:14,278
If these people carry the body,

879
01:10:14,485 --> 01:10:15,964
I won't perform the rituals,

880
01:10:16,125 --> 01:10:17,320
just so you are clear.

881
01:10:17,525 --> 01:10:20,324
This is going too far!

882
01:10:22,005 --> 01:10:23,154
In this day and age,

883
01:10:23,325 --> 01:10:24,884
you still think like this?

884
01:10:25,085 --> 01:10:26,803
Priest?

885
01:10:27,005 --> 01:10:28,962
Would you come back, please?

886
01:10:30,365 --> 01:10:32,800
I'll go talk to him.

887
01:10:47,925 --> 01:10:49,120
Can I shoot him

888
01:10:49,285 --> 01:10:51,595
before we carry your father,

889
01:10:51,805 --> 01:10:54,399
or do I have to wait until after?

890
01:10:54,645 --> 01:10:56,318
Chandra's not so bad,

891
01:10:56,485 --> 01:10:57,884
and it will go much faster

892
01:10:58,045 --> 01:10:59,524
with all of us carrying, sir.

893
01:10:59,685 --> 01:11:01,119
It had better, Lt. Suraj!

894
01:11:01,325 --> 01:11:04,522
You tore us away from celebrating,

895
01:11:04,765 --> 01:11:07,359
and this cold night is starting

896
01:11:07,525 --> 01:11:08,799
to sober me up!

897
01:11:09,005 --> 01:11:10,882
You honor my father, sir.

898
01:11:17,685 --> 01:11:20,359
I agree with you about our traditions,

899
01:11:20,565 --> 01:11:21,964
but it makes no sense

900
01:11:22,125 --> 01:11:23,445
to wait any longer.

901
01:11:24,405 --> 01:11:26,681
If we continue to give in to this,

902
01:11:26,845 --> 01:11:28,643
that, and the other thing,

903
01:11:29,005 --> 01:11:32,714
eventually we will have nothing left!

904
01:11:33,285 --> 01:11:36,164
Worse, we will be nothing!

905
01:11:36,765 --> 01:11:38,597
I won't go along with this!

906
01:11:38,765 --> 01:11:40,244
We'll cease to exist.

907
01:11:40,565 --> 01:11:42,954
Let's wait for Suraj.

908
01:11:43,405 --> 01:11:45,157
What if Suraj never comes?

909
01:11:45,405 --> 01:11:46,759
If he doesn't come,

910
01:11:47,045 --> 01:11:48,956
it would be better to let Chitra's body

911
01:11:49,125 --> 01:11:50,718
rot than to let them carry him!

912
01:11:51,245 --> 01:11:53,919
How many years since we split?

913
01:11:54,645 --> 01:11:55,874
Could it be eight?

914
01:11:56,085 --> 01:11:56,995
Yes...

915
01:11:57,525 --> 01:12:01,075
we fought against the King together,

916
01:12:01,245 --> 01:12:02,360
many years,

917
01:12:02,605 --> 01:12:05,074
and now you think of me as the enemy.

918
01:12:05,485 --> 01:12:07,362
But we had to start

919
01:12:07,525 --> 01:12:10,438
the peace process somewhere.

920
01:12:11,325 --> 01:12:14,443
But this compromise gave away too much.

921
01:12:14,805 --> 01:12:20,960
We have to stop killing each other.

922
01:12:21,485 --> 01:12:23,203
Who's doing the killing? Not us.

923
01:12:23,485 --> 01:12:25,078
Oh, you want to see it?

924
01:12:29,965 --> 01:12:32,605
What rights have we minorities

925
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:35,803
ever received by politely asking?

926
01:12:37,685 --> 01:12:40,438
But how will we find our way back

927
01:12:40,605 --> 01:12:42,243
from this violence?

928
01:12:42,685 --> 01:12:44,039
How much more

929
01:12:44,205 --> 01:12:47,163
can we ask people to take?

930
01:12:50,845 --> 01:12:53,439
I understand, but this is a step backward.

931
01:12:53,765 --> 01:12:55,164
They even took back rights

932
01:12:55,325 --> 01:12:56,201
we already had!

933
01:13:01,045 --> 01:13:02,638
Drop your weapons

934
01:13:02,805 --> 01:13:05,319
and surrender yourselves!

935
01:13:06,125 --> 01:13:08,924
You trick me after all these years?

936
01:13:09,285 --> 01:13:11,481
And over your father's dead body!

937
01:13:11,805 --> 01:13:12,954
Please hold your ?re!

938
01:13:13,125 --> 01:13:14,798
There are women and children.

939
01:13:14,965 --> 01:13:16,558
Don't tell me how to do my job!

940
01:13:16,725 --> 01:13:18,238
I brought them to help, Chandra!

941
01:13:18,645 --> 01:13:20,363
What have you done?

942
01:13:20,565 --> 01:13:23,523
Comrade Kumar, we are surrounded!

943
01:13:24,085 --> 01:13:26,679
Agni, get these civilians out of here.

944
01:13:30,605 --> 01:13:32,243
Kumar, this is a misunderstanding!

945
01:13:32,405 --> 01:13:33,361
The only thing

946
01:13:33,525 --> 01:13:35,038
they understand are bullets!

947
01:13:39,725 --> 01:13:41,841
Don't shoot! There are children!

948
01:13:42,005 --> 01:13:43,996
Durga, grab the children!

949
01:14:15,205 --> 01:14:17,640
Other than the one guerrilla killed,

950
01:14:17,805 --> 01:14:19,557
it's mostly minor injuries.

951
01:14:19,805 --> 01:14:21,239
What time did it start?

952
01:14:21,445 --> 01:14:23,675
I don't know. It was late.

953
01:14:23,885 --> 01:14:25,762
Do you know, brother?

954
01:14:45,485 --> 01:14:47,715
Lieutenant Suraj, we need to leave now.

955
01:14:47,925 --> 01:14:48,881
Good work.

956
01:14:49,085 --> 01:14:50,155
Thank you, sir.

957
01:14:59,685 --> 01:15:02,438
Seems like they need your help over there.

958
01:15:17,925 --> 01:15:20,804
I'm sorry if I messed things up

959
01:15:20,965 --> 01:15:23,115
between you and Suraj.

960
01:15:23,765 --> 01:15:25,483
It was selfish.

961
01:15:25,725 --> 01:15:27,204
It's okay.

962
01:15:29,565 --> 01:15:31,522
I don't want to marry Suraj.

963
01:15:32,685 --> 01:15:33,755
Oh...

964
01:15:34,645 --> 01:15:36,636
You don't?

965
01:15:40,165 --> 01:15:42,520
Durga, have you seen the children?

966
01:15:43,125 --> 01:15:45,924
They're probably watching the helicopter.

967
01:15:47,965 --> 01:15:52,118
Can you check over there, please?

968
01:15:54,085 --> 01:15:55,758
What were you saying?

969
01:15:55,925 --> 01:15:56,881
That I'm glad

970
01:15:57,045 --> 01:15:59,321
you're not marrying my brother

971
01:16:02,525 --> 01:16:04,198
Because you hate each other.

972
01:16:04,365 --> 01:16:05,355
It's ridiculous.

973
01:16:15,205 --> 01:16:17,481
No man will call me wife again.

974
01:16:20,685 --> 01:16:21,880
If you're sure...

975
01:16:25,645 --> 01:16:27,761
Where's Chitra's body?

976
01:16:32,005 --> 01:16:34,315
We asked you to stay with the body.

977
01:16:38,245 --> 01:16:40,395
How could you lose him?

978
01:16:40,765 --> 01:16:42,358
How could I know

979
01:16:42,525 --> 01:16:44,994
someone would move him?

980
01:16:45,325 --> 01:16:47,555
You were also there with me!

981
01:16:47,845 --> 01:16:48,835
He's a dead man.

982
01:16:49,005 --> 01:16:50,564
He couldn't walk away. Kaji?

983
01:16:50,725 --> 01:16:51,681
You think I moved him?

984
01:16:51,845 --> 01:16:53,677
Haven't you seen the bullet in my leg?

985
01:16:53,845 --> 01:16:55,802
What if the Army helicopter took him?

986
01:16:56,005 --> 01:16:58,440
Yes. That must be what happened.

987
01:16:58,805 --> 01:17:00,364
Then what can we do?

988
01:17:02,685 --> 01:17:04,562
Carry him back from Kathmandu.

989
01:17:04,725 --> 01:17:05,715
Kathmandu!?

990
01:17:05,885 --> 01:17:08,638
Durga, Chandra, everyone come, the kids!

991
01:17:08,885 --> 01:17:10,478
I found them! Please come.

992
01:17:10,685 --> 01:17:12,084
What is she saying?

993
01:17:12,285 --> 01:17:14,117
Where are the children?
