1
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:40,870
What do you want, baby?
- l want red roses.

2
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:42,803
They're out of stock.
l've other flowers. Take them.

3
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:43,874
No, l want only red roses.

4
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,175
l had only a few of them.
Just now, a boy bought them.

5
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:50,780
Will you give me those flowers?
l'll give you money.

6
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,975
No, l won't. My mother
likes them very much.

7
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:56,919
My friend also like them.
Today is her birthday.

8
00:00:58,825 --> 00:00:59,723
lt's okay.
Take them.

9
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:01,219
Take money.- No thanks.

10
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:03,121
My mom won't scold me if she knows
that l've given to a small girl.

11
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:15,570
Mom, l didn't bring you flowers today.
Don't feel bad.

12
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:42,163
Sruthi has come.

13
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:45,299
Look, they like each other very much.
- Yes.

14
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:48,869
Anu, go & get pudding for her.
- Okay mummy.

15
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:57,878
As Krishna Murthy said,
they are born for each other.

16
00:01:58,785 --> 00:01:59,547
And this boy...?

17
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:02,154
Of these 2 girls, don't know
for whom he has taken birth.

18
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:05,414
To whom he's going to say
''l'm there for you''

19
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:30,512
Hey... Get up...

20
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,143
Where is the old man?

21
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,379
My father's name is Narayana Swamy.
- Your father...?

22
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:36,677
He found you on the road.

23
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:39,589
He took money from us
& now, dodging us.

24
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:40,882
Where is that bloody thief?

25
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:43,628
lf you again abuse my father,
l'll not be quiet.

26
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,629
What will you do?

27
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:08,310
W W W . T M S T O R R E N T S . C O M

28
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:17,453
Venu stop.

29
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:18,659
Sathyam come.

30
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:21,165
l went to get money
to give you.

31
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:25,063
What are you doing?
What's all this?

32
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:27,296
He abused you.- So what?

33
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,600
Why did you stop me
from hitting him?

34
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:31,243
Hit them when you grow up.

35
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,407
Study well & hit them
with your intelligence.

36
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:35,705
Come.

37
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:41,250
The light said to the dark,
l'm there for you.

38
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:46,287
Victory said to the defeat,
l'm there for you.

39
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:50,785
l'm there for you...
And nothing will happen to you.

40
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:56,299
And l will change the fate.

41
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:15,245
Make defeat your stepping
stone to success.

42
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:20,651
Consider your enemies as challenges
overcome & march forward.

43
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,995
Use your tears to
fulfill your dreams.

44
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:35,903
Use fire to give light.

45
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:38,405
My heart gave me courage.

46
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:40,804
My eyes showed me the path.

47
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:43,315
My step showed me my destination.

48
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,075
And said l'm there for you.

49
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,121
Kamal, are these sweets enough?

50
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:24,018
Why have you brought
only one packet?

51
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:26,248
This is enough for you only.
Get more. Go.

52
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:29,327
Why did you tell him?
He might eat them all.

53
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:32,323
What are you doing there
with that garland?

54
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:38,870
Venu is really lucky man,

55
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,730
Like us, he was also a worker,
working with us.

56
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:44,270
And now, he has opened
an office against Simhachalam Naidu.

57
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,477
lt is his good time.- lf Simhachalam
Naidu comes to know about this,

58
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,340
he won't be able to sleep.
He'll drink a full bottle of liquor.

59
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,047
There is no kick.
- Do you want another bottle?

60
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:01,351
Get me a cup of tea.
- Tea...?

61
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:05,397
Venu is eating up my mind.

62
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:09,293
Like pouring kerosene to a petrol car,
you're having tea after liquor.

63
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:13,529
Tea is not to drink
but to gurgle.

64
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:17,704
When Venu was 5,
he used to get me tea.

65
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,813
Boss, why did you pour
hot tea on you?

66
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:25,142
When Venu was 10, he cleaned
when tea fell on me.- Boss...

67
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:32,155
When he was 15,
he cleaned my office.

68
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,519
After that, he was not seen.

69
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,053
Since he was an orphan,
l thought he had gone somewhere.

70
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:41,058
He did MBA
& said ''how are you?''.

71
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:46,035
l thought he was asking for a job,
and made him the manager.

72
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:47,194
Boss.

73
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:50,931
l thought he would be supporting me.

74
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:55,775
But he has opened a company
challenging me in the port itself.

75
00:06:56,215 --> 00:07:02,017
The bottles might be empty,
but my power hasn't gone yet.

76
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:06,320
No seed can germinte
under the shade of a Banyan tree.

77
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:07,823
Even if it germinates,
no plant can grow.

78
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,486
Even if it grows,
it can't survive.

79
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:13,556
His company must be closed
on the opening day itself.

80
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:17,925
Behead him
before the ribbon is cut.

81
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:18,932
Bring that ribbon.

82
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:22,531
The decoration is over.
Tie the ribbon & the job is done.

83
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:26,642
What are you doing?

84
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:27,711
Hey, where's Venu?

85
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:30,115
Why are you hitting my boy?
- Tell me, where's Venu?

86
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:31,708
Stop.

87
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:33,408
Beat them until they tell us
about Venu's whereabouts.

88
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:34,344
Beat them.

89
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:56,472
Beat them all.
Spare none.

90
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:58,007
Venu, look at them.

91
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:02,808
What's all this Ravi?

92
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:04,911
You were a labourer
in the port till yesterday.

93
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,708
And today, you've opened a company
& have become a contractor...

94
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,420
Will our Simmachalam Naidu
keep quiet?

95
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,222
Ravi, better arrange them properly
& go.

96
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,685
Will you hit me
if l don't do it?

97
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,960
l don't know to fight. Go.

98
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,886
Don't know to fight...?

99
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:19,994
He says that he doesn't
know to fight.

100
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:47,089
Though you don't know to fight,
you're trying to show off,

101
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,959
l'm Waltair Ravi.
How proud l should be feeling.

102
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:12,181
You said you don't know to fight.

103
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:14,381
Yes. l know to begin the fight.

104
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,448
But l don't know
to end it.

105
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:35,465
Whom are you searching for?

106
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:37,665
One man said he doesn't know
to fight,

107
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,531
But he has beaten all my men
& is now hiding.

108
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:41,803
Where is he hiding?
- That's what...

109
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:50,640
Mother...father...

110
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,281
Grandma...Grandfather...

111
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,486
Mother...father...

112
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,280
Brother... No brother.

113
00:10:57,523 --> 00:11:00,048
Do you know to fight?
- Fight means....

114
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:01,387
What else do you know?

115
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,058
l know to make garlands,
cleaning the house,

116
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:07,025
to wash clothes.
l know everything.

117
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,295
l'll be back in 10 mins.
Get everything ready.

118
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,528
Okay brother.
You go.

119
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,965
l'll decorate like the canopy
in the marriage. You go...

120
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,379
Greetings sir.
- Please sit.

121
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:25,975
Greeting sir.
- Greetings.

122
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,610
Mr. Jayaprakash met the
Home Minister,

123
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:30,311
and has come in a flight,
that's why he is late.

124
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:32,523
Sorry for making you people
to wait.

125
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:37,926
lt has been 2 yrs. since our
Visaka Power project was started.

126
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:41,297
My thanks to you all
for co-operating with me.

127
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:04,278
Despatch it by tomorrow.
- Okay.

128
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,583
You're Venu, right?
- Yes.

129
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:10,956
Your style has changed.
What's the matter?

130
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:14,058
l'm opening a transport company
in the port.

131
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:16,225
l've come to take him
with me for the function.

132
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:19,429
Go.

133
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:22,766
A boy who had worked under you
is coming up in life,

134
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,043
You must also be a happy man.
Go.

135
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,271
Come.

136
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:30,344
Come.

137
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,483
Tie it fast.
- l'm tying it. Why are you hitting me?

138
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:38,085
Venu is here....

139
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:42,124
Tie it. lf we don't tie
it properly, he'll beat us.

140
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:44,860
Sir, please come. Everyone
is waiting for you only.

141
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,834
He has come to cut the ribbon.
Still tying...?

142
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:50,866
They only know to fight
& not to tie.

143
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:51,695
Fight...?

144
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:55,864
Some idiot has sent them
to spoil the garlands & break the chairs.

145
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,766
He is not telling me
that idiot's name.

146
00:12:58,144 --> 00:12:59,702
You being an elder,
he might tell you if you ask him.

147
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:01,471
Who is it?
Who told you to do this?

148
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,046
He won't tell you if you ask
so gently.

149
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,146
Slap him twice...

150
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:07,742
Who told you to do so?

151
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:11,551
He must be the king of idiots
for trusting this idiot.

152
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,554
Ribbon...
- lt's scissors & not ribbon.

153
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,028
Let's go.
l've not seen an idiot like you.

154
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,562
You've made me to
inaugurate.

155
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:31,072
Hey, get that Manmadha Rao out.
- Okay uncle.

156
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,871
Shit!
Will you get me out?

157
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:36,940
l'm nearing my century.
- Century...?

158
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:40,352
Yes. l've already scored 2 runs.
Only 96 more. Put the ball.

159
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:41,411
You wait.

160
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:44,448
Going to hit a century...?
Let me see how he'll do it.

161
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:46,216
What are you doing, uncle?

162
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:54,324
Bowl. See the center stump.

163
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:56,862
Bowl.

164
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:06,745
You're out...

165
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:09,271
Go.
l'll hit you with this bat.

166
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:11,440
There must have been
match fixing. Get lost.

167
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:19,148
A small boy has got
you out.

168
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,153
lt would've been a century
if l had hit 96 runs more.

169
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:31,330
You're absolutely right.
There is nothing in his head.

170
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:32,662
What is it?

171
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:44,876
Great shot!- Sorry friends.

172
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:46,141
Lets go.- Where's the ball?

173
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,181
Let's go & get it.

174
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:53,486
l think the ball might be there.

175
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:56,692
Stop.
Step aside.

176
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:59,693
Where are you going?
This area is mine.

Okay go.

Did you see a ball?
lt's Venu who hit it.

180
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:10,706
The cricket ball is missing.

181
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,242
Why are you staring at me?
ls the ball in this?

182
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:18,415
Don't hit me.
l'll go away.

183
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:24,221
You boys go & find the ball.
- Go...

184
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:28,258
l doubt the ball is in this pot.

185
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:31,287
Hey girl!

186
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:34,889
l'm thirsty.
Will you give me some water.

187
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:38,869
lt's me who is thirsty
& not him.- Go.

188
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:40,662
Okay, pour it.

189
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:48,237
Did you get it?
- No. But the girl is dazzling.

190
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:50,681
The ball is with her.

191
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:51,573
Hey girl! Stop.

192
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:58,852
Do you want the ball?

193
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:03,226
lf you come to this damsel,

194
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,960
Why do you need a ball?

195
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,833
Ask me anything you want?

196
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:13,638
Will l deny you?

197
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,499
Can't you give us?
- Why would she give you?

198
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:28,483

O boy...mischievous boy...

When you are requesting so much,

203
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:56,110

204
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:07,353
ln Kurnool town...
in a goldsmith's shop...

205
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:18,225
l've brought you silver anklets...
Give me your right leg dear...

206
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:35,046
Shall l give cone milk to you

When you request me,

Shall l give you a Ganta brand cigar?

212
00:18:52,998 --> 00:19:00,234
Refusing to take that is offered...
Failing to ask what is with me...

213
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:11,405
You've become nervous...
Shall l give you a tonic?

214
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:18,619
O girl...beautiful girl...

00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:32,560
Won't l give you if you ask me?
Won't l massage you with oil?

219
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:51,313
You've lost in debate and in play...
with a girl... remove your...

220
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:55,153
Remove your moustache
and give it to me.

221
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:11,367
You want me to remove the
moustache because it hurts you.

222
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:31,118
Hey, who are you?
You bloody thief.

223
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:36,422
Hey girl! Stop!

224
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:37,886
Theif...

225
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:39,722
Theif...

226
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,430
Oh my flowers!

227
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,000
Stop.

00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:47,631
l'll call you now.

229
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:49,038
Leave me.
- Purse.

230
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:51,106
Get lost...

231
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:55,343
My purse.
- Yours...?

232
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,239
What happened?

233
00:21:57,516 --> 00:21:59,211
She broke my car glass.
- Really?

234
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,475
What about you?
- She stamped all my flowers.

235
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:02,911
And you..?
- l fell down because of her.

236
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:04,352
You're great.

237
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:06,283
How much?
- Rs. 3000.

238
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:08,086
Why did you park your car there?

239
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,318
Where else do you want
me to park it?- Rs. 3000.

240
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:10,491
How about you?
- Rs. 500.

241
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:13,189
Rs, 500.- See you.
- Rs. 1000, sir.- The mistake was hers...

242
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:15,127
Look, l got hurt.
- You're still alive, aren't you?

243
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:16,591
There is no money.

244
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:18,459
You've damaged their properties
without money in your purse.

245
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,604
Who are you to give
them my money?- Me...?

246
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:22,601
What else can l do
other than giving money to them?

247
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:27,133
Take your purse.

248
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:32,273
God gave beautiful hands to women
to put vermillion,

249
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:36,779
to apply lipstick,
to give flying kiss to their lovers.

250
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:38,987
How much?
- Rs. 1000.

251
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:41,715
Here is your Rs. 1000.

252
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:46,397
Hey, my chain.
- Yes, it is your chain.

253
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:47,730
l gave him money.

254
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:50,133
l'll have this
till you repay my money.

255
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,804
That's my house.
Come & give it.

256
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:57,604
l'll teach you a lesson.
- With pleasure.

257
00:22:57,909 --> 00:22:59,206
Now l took only your chain.

258
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:01,538
Next time, l wonder what l may
take from you. lt's upto yours.

259
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:04,979
He seems to be a
much clever theif.

260
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,181
So, you've lost the chain
which l gave it on your birthday.

261
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:10,485
Oh my god! Lost that chain!
lt is 6 sovereigns.

262
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:12,724
File a case.- Case..?

263
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,323
Forget about what had happened
& keep quiet.

264
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,617
Keep quiet...?
How can that be possible?

265
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:18,360
Will you file a case
or shall l find another lawyer?

266
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:19,327
What will you file?

267
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:20,822
Now, he only took
away her chain.

268
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:22,598
l wonder what he'll take from her.

269
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:23,291
And more over
she is a girl.

270
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:25,503
From when have you become
a coward?

271
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:27,327
The day l became your
mother's husband.

272
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,705
You don't worry, mom.

273
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,600
l know how to get back my chain.

274
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:33,468
Where are you going?

275
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,277
l'm not going to him.
l'm going to Anu's place.

276
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:39,015
She's going to Tanjur tomorrow,
for a music competition.

277
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:41,745
lf l don't wish her good luck,
she might feel bad.

278
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:51,676
You'll bag the 1st prize in the
Tanjur carnatic music competition.

279
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,578
Uncle, you've produced a
good successor.

280
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:58,348
l've no properties
to give to my successor.

281
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:01,684
l've given her music which was
given to me by my fore fathers.

282
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:04,823
As you said, if she bags
the 1st prize in Tanjur competition,

283
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,429
it is like my life attaining
salvation.

284
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,291
Why doubt, she'll bag the
1st prize.

285
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:11,162
Your words must come true.

286
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:14,700
Anu, pack your clothes.
We've to start early morning.

287
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:43,329
Please forgive me, daddy.

288
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:11,628
Come, lets go.

289
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:31,975
Are you tensed?
Shall l get you some water?

290
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:38,353
You go this side.

291
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:40,586
Water bottle please.
- Rs. 12.

292
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,291
lt's him.
- Catch him.

293
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:54,538
Stop him.
- Catch him.

294
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:56,105
Are you blind?

295
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:19,196
Leave me.

296
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,092
Hey, leave me.

297
00:28:24,936 --> 00:28:26,733
Why did you hand him over
to the police?

298
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:28,867
Police were after him.
So, l handed over to them.

299
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:30,766
What was his fault?

300
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:32,942
We had planned to get married.

301
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,043
Since our parents didn't agree,
we are going away.

302
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:37,039
ls it wrong?

303
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,081
Sir, l beg you.
- Get lost.

304
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:46,553
Please leave Arun.
- Leave me.

305
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:50,284
Look at her.
- She's like soft butter chicken.

306
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:55,365
Come with me.

307
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:56,325
Leave me.

308
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:08,143
Greetings. What are you doing
in the station now?

309
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:10,638
What bothers you?

310
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:14,783
She is my fiancee.
She eloped from her house.

311
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:17,784
My aunt phoned & informed me.
l'm taking her home.

312
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:22,483
But she said that
she fell in love with someone,

313
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,820
and she has eloped
to marry him.

314
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:25,855
What?

315
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:28,322
You fell in love with someone
& eloped from the house!

316
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:30,997
lf your aunt knows this,
she'll have a heart attack.

317
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:33,034
Come. Fall at her feet
& seek her forgiveness.

318
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:34,863
No.

319
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:37,168
First you'll fold your sleeves.

320
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:38,566
You won't remove your shoes.

321
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:40,102
You'll say that you don't
know to fight.

322
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:41,878
After that, you'll beat us
black & blue.

323
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,269
l'll tell you the truth.

324
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:46,381
She fell in love with
J.P.'s son Arun.

325
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:48,585
She is very talented.

326
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:49,942
Take a sip of tea.

327
00:29:50,755 --> 00:29:54,919
Since the girl is beautiful,
we've planned to rape & kill her.

328
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:55,851
Shall l proceed?

329
00:29:58,363 --> 00:29:59,091
Boys, take them out.

330
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:05,560
Bye.

331
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:08,769
A wonderful chance.
But we missed it.

332
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:17,305
Greetings sir.

333
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:19,014
Who are you?

334
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:21,152
l handed a boy to you in the
railway station 30 mins. back.

335
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:22,009
Where is he?

336
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:23,411
lt's you.

337
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,084
He's son of J.P.

338
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:27,119
We handed him to J.P. then itself.

339
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:30,718
You've safely handed a 25 yr.
old boy to his father.

340
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:34,121
But left a 19 yr. old girl
stranded on the road. Superb sir.

341
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:35,493
Speaking logics!

342
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:37,898
Do you know what will happen
to her if J.P. files a case?

343
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,833
l'll find that out from J.P. itself.
Bye.

344
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:00,749
Sir...
- Where is J.P.?

345
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:01,923
He is out of station.
- And his son...?

346
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:02,956
Both of them are out of station.

347
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:05,228
When will they come back?
- l don't know.

348
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:06,552
Sleep.
- Okay sir.

349
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:20,438
Look, l very well know
where J.P. will be.

350
00:31:21,412 --> 00:31:22,379
You don't worry.

351
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:24,906
l'll hand over Arun to you. Okay...?

352
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:26,244
Listen to me.

353
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:27,842
l'll drop you in your house.

354
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,777
You parents will also be
worried about you.

355
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:31,052
They won't tell you anything.

356
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:32,948
Stop.

357
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:35,754
Though you don't feel ashamed
to come back home,

358
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:38,292
l feel ashamed to be your father.

359
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:40,689
Just a minute...
- You're no way related to this.

360
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:43,623
l won't allow this nonsense
into my house again.

361
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:47,527
l wanted you to be a great singer.

362
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,264
But you have broke my heart.
Get lost.

363
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:53,442
l've 2 more daughters.
l must perform their marriage.

364
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:54,339
Get lost from here.

365
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:57,873
Come.

366
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:22,031
Come in.

367
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:29,310
Hanumanthu, get up.

368
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:34,785
We are bachelors.
So, friends do come here & enjoy.

369
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:36,417
lt's alright.
No problem. Come.

370
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:39,814
Shut up.

371
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:47,889
Please sit.

372
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:00,208
Don't feel sad for your
father's words.

373
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:02,104
Any father will talk like that only.

374
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:06,315
l'll find out where Arun is.

375
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:10,718
l know Arun's father Jayaprakash
very well.

376
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:17,027
When l was in teens,
l was also going after girls.

377
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:18,829
But never fell in love, like you.

378
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,427
l used them & left them.

379
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,193
Why are you bowing
your head in shame?

380
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:26,869
You've done it, now forget it.

381
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:30,501
Now you've only choice,
forget about that girl.

382
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,266
Go...

383
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,146
JP? Please tell me sir.

384
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,314
What happened to my job?

385
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:39,677
Won't it be done once
you entrust me a job?

386
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:42,082
Wait for few days,
what about my contract?

387
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,448
Meet me on 25 th.

388
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:45,783
l'll get the contract for you.

389
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:48,358
Like a paddle to the boat and
a scorpion under the shoe,

390
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:49,983
l'll always be loyal to you.

391
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:53,096
l don't want your loyalty,
l want her death.

392
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:54,722
Tell me just news
about her death.

393
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:57,400
lt'll be done sir...
wait...my man has returned.

394
00:33:57,568 --> 00:34:00,594
What happened? Tell me quickly,
JP sir is in the line.

395
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:01,431
Job is done.

396
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:03,699
Didn't l say your
job will be done.

397
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:05,138
Okay, bye. - Okay sir.

398
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:10,510
l'm as happy as Chandrababu
giving Hi-Tech city to me.

399
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:14,875
For the job done, JP is sanctioning
5 crore worth contract to us.

400
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:18,386
l didn't say share is finished,
l mean we are finished.

401
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:19,681
What are you saying man?

402
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:21,451
We almost killed her
near the station,

403
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:22,384
Then?

404
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:25,118
Venu entered and took her away,
our plans went haywire.

405
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,296
How did Venu enter the scene?

406
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:28,430
What to do sir?

407
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:31,167
Like Earth revolving
around the sun,

408
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:33,460
l'm also revolving around him.

409
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:37,298
She must die today!

410
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:40,700
There will be many problems,

411
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:42,176
we must bring it to home,

412
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:44,304
moreover the man she loves
is not an ordinary man,

413
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,747
JP's son, what if we face
problems from JP?

414
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:50,253
First let me solve the problems
she's facing because of me,

415
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:53,253
later we'll think about others.
Come. - Please listen friend.

416
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,662
Go to Manmadha Rao's shop and
bring clothes for Anu. - Okay.

417
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:05,300
Why don't you respond even
after abusing for half an hour?

418
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,938
Not only height and hair,
your brain is also little.

419
00:35:08,072 --> 00:35:10,267
That's why you experimenting
with these foolish designs.

420
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,931
Rotten pumpkin face!

421
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:14,143
lf you design anything
foolish like this again,

422
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,836
l'll design your death.

423
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:16,841
Be careful.

424
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:23,679
Get lost man, you need
a design for your face.

425
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:27,451
Go to roadside tailors.

426
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:31,220
Why is he blessing you?

427
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:33,891
Nothing, he's little mad.

428
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:36,097
He came here to get his
wife's blouse stitched,

429
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:38,928
generally blouses are stitched
with back windows,

430
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:42,437
for a variety l stitched it
with front windows.

431
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,267
Everyone who had seen it
say it's fantastic.

432
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:46,672
He didn't like it, so over reacting.

433
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:48,209
Can you give that man's address?
- Why?

434
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:49,175
l'll go to his house
in his absence.

435
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,544
You don't know about him,

436
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:53,410
he'll suck your entire blood.

437
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:55,848
Creators like me have
to face these.

438
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:58,283
Do you consider yourself
a great creator?

439
00:35:58,422 --> 00:35:59,389
Any doubt? - Yes.

440
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:02,716
l can make an ordinary
shirt into a T-shirt.

441
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:03,986
Make my shirt into a T-shirt.

442
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,459
That's all? Wait there.

443
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:06,392
Don't move.

444
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:09,894
What's this?

445
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:11,296
This was ordinary shirt
earlier, wasn't it? - Yes.

446
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:12,663
Now it is a T-shirt.

447
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,203
Never get smart with me,
l'll finish you.

448
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:16,871
Mind your work.

449
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:19,340
Nothing, Venu has a girl guest,

450
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:20,501
she needs few good dresses.

451
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:25,815
She's not in UKG but
studies in college.

452
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:28,815
Not this type but long one.

453
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:29,975
That type?

454
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:32,086
Then select in that wing. Go.

455
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:35,890
What's the price?

456
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,084
Price is...

457
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:49,495
Sorry Kareena, l couldn't attend
your sister Karishma's marriage,

458
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:50,333
please don't take it serious.

459
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:52,841
Didn't she like the dress?

460
00:36:56,113 --> 00:36:59,241
Was it up to here,
lift it little up,

461
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:02,275
Oh Mamma! Oops!
l'll talk to you later.

462
00:37:03,754 --> 00:37:05,915
Swapna, look how beautiful
the fishes are.

463
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:11,292
Shall l tell you why they
are so beautiful?

464
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:13,493
Why?
- Because they are naked.

465
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,658
Eat chicken and mutton,
you're very thin.

466
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,729
Won't you leave any girl?

467
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,599
Okay, pack them and bill it
to Venu's account.

468
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,229
Will he pay? - Venu will pay.

469
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:25,168
Do one thing, take it like that.

470
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,201
Go now.

471
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:32,748
ls it true what your sister told me?

472
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:37,386
She said your father is upset over
your eloping with your lover.

473
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:40,386
lt's true, but l want to
meet you immediately.

474
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:41,614
Where are you now?

475
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:44,625
l'm in the house of a port
contractor known as Venu.

476
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:45,489
Okay, l'm coming now.

477
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:51,965
l'm going to office.

478
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:11,714
What girl? Where's that Venu?

479
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:13,616
He has ran away fearing me,
he'll not save you anymore,

480
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:15,724
come with me.

481
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:18,018
l'll show you heaven
and hell at a time.

482
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:24,899
Hey Stop!

483
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,104
Stop...

484
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:31,465
She's going away, go fast.

485
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:44,684
Sruthi, go fast. Those rowdies
are chasing us.

486
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:03,801
Go fast...

487
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:08,444
Venu is following us,
can't you watch behind?

488
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:11,379
lf watch my behind
and drive, you'll not live.

489
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:14,148
Like the Red flag not
leaving West Bengal,

490
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:15,910
l think Venu will never leave me.

491
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:16,917
Turn the jeep.

492
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:20,119
lf you don't turn the
jeep immediately...

493
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:21,450
What if l don't?

494
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,225
l'll jump from running jeep.
- Do it.

495
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:27,727
Turn to right immediately.

496
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:33,862
No need to fear anymore,
we've raeched the home.

497
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:35,402
What's it Sruthi?

498
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:39,935
Lawyer...you here...?

499
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:40,805
This is my house.

500
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:43,610
Just now a gas cylinder
came in with a girl.

501
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:44,204
Gas cylinder?

502
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:46,145
Like a cylinder wearing
T-shirt and pant.

503
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:48,375
She's not gas cylinder
but my daughter Sruthi.

504
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:49,810
l didn't know she
was your daughter.

505
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:51,955
No problem, she just went
in with her friend.

506
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:52,986
ls she inside? - Yes.

507
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:57,522
Venu wants to undo the mistake
by getting me & Arun married.

508
00:39:57,995 --> 00:40:00,020
He'll not try, he'll do it.

509
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,755
l now Venu from childhood.

510
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:03,565
You needn't be scared, come out.

511
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:11,473
Sorry, l thought you were also one
of those rowdies following us.

512
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,107
Now you know l'm not, don't you?

513
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:14,175
Very clearly.

514
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:16,472
From today Anu will stay with me.

515
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:18,975
Dear...one sec.. - Where?

516
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:20,372
What?

517
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:22,484
She has eloped with a lover
against parents wish,

518
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:24,449
if she stays here, will our
daughter get married?

519
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,181
Shut up! She'll feel if she hears it.

520
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:31,817
l'm not bothered if she feels,
she'll not stay here, that's it.

521
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:44,168
Venu, please don't mind it.

522
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:46,305
My wife has a big mouth
but very small heart.

523
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:48,911
l'll manage her,
let Anu stay here.

524
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:52,305
No sir, Anu will stay with me,
you know about JP,

525
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,111
you're a legal man and
he's a illegal man.

526
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,545
Anu is better of with me
in this situation.

527
00:40:57,655 --> 00:40:58,349
Bye.

528
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:05,887
What's your idea?

529
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:08,995
Will you walk out if
my mother abuses you?

530
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:11,634
How many times didn't l get scolded
by your mother since childhood?

531
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:13,463
Did l stop coming to your
house getting angry?

532
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:14,933
What are you looking at?

533
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:15,931
Nothing...

534
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:18,802
Memories of my childhood are
returning looking at you both.

535
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:20,408
We had a small stove,

536
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:22,307
a large sized gas cylinder
in my neighbour's place.

537
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,037
So what?

538
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,269
You both look like that.

539
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:26,676
You mean...she's stove and l'm...

540
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:27,613
the cylinder.

541
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:29,914
Are you calling me a cylinder?

542
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:34,181
A festival is in progress there,
friends are waiting there for us,

543
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:36,521
come let's go.

544
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:37,355
Priest, give me some more.

545
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,122
Have it praying goddess.

546
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:39,821
Mother!

547
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:48,704
l never expected the drink to
be so tasty in the festival.

548
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:50,604
For me. - For me too.

549
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,274
Priest, a peg for me.

550
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,704
Offering is fantastic! - Yes.

551
00:41:58,582 --> 00:42:01,642
A cigarette now will add fun to it.

552
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:03,410
You know about my mother
very well, don't you?

553
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:05,882
Why are you pushing me?

554
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,388
Women are standing before me.
Don't you have manners?

555
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:13,093
Can't you understand
if l tell you once?

556
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:28,077
Not to me but to them.

557
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:28,940
Sorry sister.

558
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:29,770
Get lost!

559
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:34,044
Venu, tell me who are they,
We'll finish them off.

560
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:35,742
l've understood onething Venu,

561
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,980
a beautiful girl like me needs
a body guard like you?

562
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:42,755
She's not only fat but arrogant too.

563
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:44,588
She must have the offering.

564
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:46,356
Have you taken goddess's offering?

565
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:47,191
Taken it?

566
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:48,059
Offering?

567
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:51,167
Don't you know?
Come l'll take you.

568
00:42:57,508 --> 00:42:59,601
Venu, you'll not stop
if you start once.

569
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:00,300
Go man.

570
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:03,741
You'll fall if you drink so much.

571
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:05,843
You just watch me.

572
00:43:10,187 --> 00:43:11,176
Oh god!

573
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:30,204
l'm getting strange
feelings, my dear...

574
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:34,777
Overcome with strange emotions...

575
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:49,424
Oh Dear! You'll feel like that only...

576
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:53,823
Overcome with strange feelings...

577
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,411
l feel cold in hot sun...

578
00:44:42,546 --> 00:44:44,480
My heart is skipping a beat...

579
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:48,675
When you come cat walking stiff...

580
00:44:48,952 --> 00:44:50,817
l feel l'll my honour today...

581
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:52,852
Fall into difficult times...

582
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:56,888
Arresting me with your looks...

583
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:59,257
Don't ruin my life...

584
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:03,231
Don't incite new desires in me...

585
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:09,061
Why do you rake up
passions in me funnily?

586
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:15,177
When you get heated up in pasion...

587
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:19,480
where will your sari go flying?

588
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,954
Eyes are drowsy...

589
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:33,852
Legs are moving fast pace...

590
00:46:34,057 --> 00:46:38,153
l'm all fired up and taking chances...

591
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,320
Softness in your youth...

592
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:42,489
Firmness and shine in your youth...

593
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:46,433
lt's trapping me amd
making me go mad over it...

594
00:46:46,603 --> 00:46:48,764
Don't totter lazily...

595
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:52,871
Don't jump in mischief...

596
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:58,945
To lose yourself...

597
00:46:59,783 --> 00:47:01,182
Shaking your plait...

598
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,082
Shaking your hips...

599
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:08,858
Showing your youthful bounties...

600
00:47:09,459 --> 00:47:13,657
When you dance merrily, my dear...

601
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:17,728
The town went gaga over you...

602
00:48:05,649 --> 00:48:07,446
Anu, l'm leaving to office.

603
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,882
Can you please take me
to the temple?

604
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:11,946
Temple?

605
00:48:12,656 --> 00:48:13,884
Okay, come let's go.

606
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:16,286
You'll get peace.

607
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,071
Dear...

608
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:20,252
l thought she came
here to pray god,

609
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:22,992
but l've understood you're her god.

610
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:25,492
lf not as your daughter,

611
00:49:26,029 --> 00:49:28,589
can't you at least offer it
as to some unknown girl?

612
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:31,256
l thought of making her
a great classical singer,

613
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:33,131
the day she left my home,

614
00:49:33,737 --> 00:49:36,228
l've given up music
which was my lifeline.

615
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:38,964
Lost my respect and honour.

616
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,206
l've forgotten l'm her father.

617
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:57,685
Come Anu.

618
00:50:04,634 --> 00:50:05,396
Greetings sir.

619
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:08,137
Oh Venu! Please come in.

620
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:10,235
How is your business going on?

621
00:50:10,474 --> 00:50:11,941
l'm not here to talk about business.

622
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:14,438
Your son must live with this girl.

623
00:50:14,745 --> 00:50:16,144
l'm here to talk about it.

624
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:19,177
Who is she?

625
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:21,476
Anu, l'll say just her name.

626
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:24,112
lf you call your son,
he'll introduce her better.

627
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:26,653
What's the connection
between her and my son?

628
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:31,585
Lovers...your police brought him
when they were eloping in train,

629
00:50:32,262 --> 00:50:33,854
ls she that girl?

630
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:36,562
They said a music
teacher's daughter,

631
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:39,134
so l had underestimated.

632
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,929
l never expected
she'll be so beautiful.

633
00:50:42,906 --> 00:50:45,704
lf you bring a girl from the street
and say she's your daughter-in-law,

634
00:50:46,476 --> 00:50:47,943
will l accept her?

635
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:51,108
l abused him wildly and
got really angry.

636
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:54,080
He left home.

637
00:50:55,852 --> 00:50:57,149
He's always like this,

638
00:50:58,522 --> 00:51:01,821
if he get's angry on me,
he'll vanish for six months.

639
00:51:03,093 --> 00:51:04,253
He's taking six month time.

640
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:05,922
You don't worry sir,

641
00:51:06,096 --> 00:51:07,996
l'll bring back your son
where ever he might be.

642
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:11,267
Anyway you liked the girl,
l'll get them married.

643
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:13,229
lt's enough if you come
and the bless them.

644
00:51:14,971 --> 00:51:16,233
l'll give some more time,

645
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:18,803
it's okay if he comes on his
own and marries her,

646
00:51:19,843 --> 00:51:22,539
otherwise l'll be forced to
show my power and style.

647
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:36,347
You've made my honour go
to the dogs for this girl only.

648
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,691
Venu has warned me, and
l remained mute like a fool.

649
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:48,234
Greetings sir, you promised
contract after killing her,

650
00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:49,362
l've come for the contract.

651
00:51:50,307 --> 00:51:50,796
What's this?

652
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:52,099
Why are you giving
a dead girl's photo?

653
00:51:52,309 --> 00:51:53,867
Do you want me to publish it
in news papers?

654
00:51:55,512 --> 00:51:58,174
lt's your photo that has
to be published noy hers.

655
00:51:59,182 --> 00:52:01,480
Lying to me about killing her?

656
00:52:03,086 --> 00:52:07,045
You can't do anything
till she's with Venu.

657
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:11,120
lf Arun comes to know she was here,

658
00:52:11,828 --> 00:52:14,797
he'll definitely try to run
away from here again.

659
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:16,694
Give me one more chance,
l'll kill her this time.

660
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:18,061
lt's impossilbe for you.

661
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,104
Where can l find Durga now?

662
00:52:29,946 --> 00:52:31,937
Why do l find 10 kgs short in sulphur?

663
00:52:32,249 --> 00:52:34,683
lt's hot, it might hav got
evaporated in heat.

664
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:36,777
What was your weight
when you joined me?

665
00:52:36,853 --> 00:52:38,013
60 kgs brother.

666
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:39,520
Now? - 70 kgs.

667
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:41,621
How did put on weight?

668
00:52:42,225 --> 00:52:43,487
l'm eating your salt, brother.

669
00:52:47,297 --> 00:52:50,858
Not just salt you've eaten teak,
sugar even sulphur too.

670
00:52:52,135 --> 00:52:52,499
Borther!

671
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:55,663
Get up man!

672
00:52:57,073 --> 00:52:59,473
Please spare me brother,
l'll never do this again.

673
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:24,424
His ashes will be around 10 kgs,
mix it with the sulphur.

674
00:53:24,568 --> 00:53:26,058
Account will tally. - Okay brother.

675
00:53:32,442 --> 00:53:33,409
Greetings sir. - Greetings.

676
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:35,238
Take his son in. - Come in sir.

677
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:37,608
You don't worry sir.

678
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:40,042
When he's with me he's
safe like in a mosque.

679
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:41,374
l'll take care of him.

680
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:43,110
He's not the only one
you've to take care,

681
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:44,252
take care her too.

682
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:47,156
l'll be out of station for 2 days.

683
00:53:47,424 --> 00:53:48,322
l'm going to Malaysia.

684
00:53:48,692 --> 00:53:50,660
Send 20 of your men.

685
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:53,124
Why to send 20 men
to kill a woman sir?

686
00:53:53,463 --> 00:53:56,125
There's man behind that woman.

687
00:54:08,478 --> 00:54:11,914
ls your lucky number 3?
You are always moody.

688
00:54:12,048 --> 00:54:13,276
Hey stop!

689
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:15,543
What are you thinking?

690
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:16,447
ls it about Arun?

691
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:19,783
He'll come definitely, don't worry
about the 6 months his father said.

692
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:20,821
That's a lie.

693
00:54:20,957 --> 00:54:23,084
Let him hide Arun anywhere,
l'll find him for you.

694
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,418
But on one condition,

695
00:54:25,629 --> 00:54:28,598
you mustn't be moody,
always keep smiling,

696
00:54:28,832 --> 00:54:30,163
your smile gives me energy.

697
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,799
lf you don't smile,
it's allergy for me.

698
00:54:38,341 --> 00:54:40,366
What? Didn't go to sleep yet?

699
00:54:40,744 --> 00:54:41,608
l'm on way...

700
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:43,640
Did you eat food?

701
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,141
l'm not hungry.

702
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:51,444
Aren't you hungry or
did they finish everything?

703
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:52,349
No not like that...

704
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:53,888
You're hesitating.

705
00:54:54,057 --> 00:54:55,684
l'll make few good dosas for you.

706
00:54:55,825 --> 00:54:56,723
Run out of gas.

707
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:03,926
You do one thing, there's a
pickle bottle, come with it.

708
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:06,401
l'll make dosas for you, come.

709
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:21,544
Anu, come! lt's ready.

710
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:24,780
Making dosa on hot iron?

711
00:55:29,259 --> 00:55:30,521
Good!- You want more?

712
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:32,656
Enough...thanks.

713
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:34,023
l must thank you,

714
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:36,997
if you'd said they're small & want more
l would've spent all night making dosas.

715
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,193
Who ever marries you
is really a lucky girl.

716
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:53,282
Anu, you look great smiling.
Keep smiling always.

717
00:55:53,883 --> 00:55:55,510
May be Arun would've
fallen for your smile.

718
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:05,152
We'll call you.

719
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:11,660
Did you also come to
attend the interview? - No.

720
00:56:11,801 --> 00:56:12,961
l came here for my daddy.

721
00:56:13,136 --> 00:56:15,001
Just now your daddy went out.

722
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,840
There's another interview,
l'll finish it, please be seated.

723
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:24,437
Greetings sir. - Greetings.

724
00:56:25,448 --> 00:56:27,416
l struggled a lot from
my childhood sir,

725
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:30,746
please be merciful and
offer me this job.

726
00:56:31,354 --> 00:56:33,549
l don't have anyone,
l'm an orphan.

727
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:38,956
Orphan is not a qualification
like MCA amd MBA,

728
00:56:39,462 --> 00:56:42,260
anyone will show mercy
if you say l'm an orphan,

729
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:43,094
they'll not offer job,

730
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:47,161
god has given you hands,
legs and brain to work.

731
00:56:47,504 --> 00:56:50,632
Use them. Never tell about
your difficulties to others.

732
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,503
Work your way to top,
now get out.

733
00:56:58,882 --> 00:57:01,578
Sruthi! Where are you?
lnterview is over.

734
00:57:03,887 --> 00:57:07,789
l took your chain for fun,
now that we are friends, take it.

735
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:09,448
Come let's go to your father.

736
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,694
Now we are friends,
if we still get closer...

737
00:57:33,683 --> 00:57:37,050
Why do you feel shy
after coming here?

738
00:57:37,253 --> 00:57:40,689
When the love bug has bitten you,
no need to fear it anymore...

739
00:57:52,035 --> 00:57:55,300
No more stopping after
coming up to here...

740
00:57:55,605 --> 00:57:59,234
Once drowned, you needn't
worry about the bank...

741
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:04,376
No need of wealth
when you don't spend it...

742
00:58:04,681 --> 00:58:08,276
No need of beauty
when you can't enjoy it...

743
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:15,352
O my dear, bribe your
way to the bed...

744
00:58:15,758 --> 00:58:22,857
O my dear,
play the game of love...

745
00:58:46,789 --> 00:58:49,485
You wanted to remove
a speck from your eyes...

746
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:53,128
then you wanted to
pinch your cheeks...

747
00:58:54,097 --> 00:58:56,895
You said you can't hold
back after that...

748
00:58:57,367 --> 00:59:00,894
kissed and squeezed
my chubby cheeks...

749
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:04,538
Reaching your neck
from your lips...

750
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:08,401
After playing with your
chain for some time...

751
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:10,372
Slipping on to my heart...

752
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:12,208
Stealing the secret...

753
00:59:12,415 --> 00:59:17,648
Not to miss an oppurtunity,
if you cross limits and take liberty...

754
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:24,453
O my dear, a moment of
pleasure passes away...

755
00:59:25,128 --> 00:59:31,863
O my dear, with your love play
the cot gives away...

756
01:00:01,397 --> 01:00:04,161
You wanted me to remove
a thorn from your feet...

757
01:00:04,734 --> 01:00:08,067
After that you wanted me
to touch your anklets...

758
01:00:08,705 --> 01:00:11,606
You didn't stop with
touching the anklets...

759
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:15,509
You climbed up from it
holding my sari end...

760
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:19,077
After getting struck between
the sari folds...

761
01:00:19,315 --> 01:00:22,773
Finding myself all at sea there...

762
01:00:23,353 --> 01:00:24,980
Dusting you off my sari...

763
01:00:25,188 --> 01:00:26,746
Catching you from falling down...

764
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:28,719
Draping you as my sari...

765
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:31,892
lf l make you my life partner....

766
01:00:32,428 --> 01:00:39,231
O my dear, my madness
for you grows with it...

767
01:00:39,535 --> 01:00:46,373
O my dear, with this
it's curtains down...

768
01:01:29,285 --> 01:01:30,217
Well said.

769
01:01:30,486 --> 01:01:31,612
Your turn only, don't worry
l'll drop a card.

770
01:01:31,788 --> 01:01:32,379
You drop a card.

771
01:01:33,322 --> 01:01:35,085
Who is he? l've seen your cards.

772
01:01:35,158 --> 01:01:36,921
l've also seen your cards
but l'll not drop the game.

773
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:40,886
lf you see my cards l'll kill you.

774
01:01:55,078 --> 01:01:56,636
Very good!
l want that card only.

775
01:02:11,994 --> 01:02:12,961
Why are you tearing it?

776
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:14,461
You want my love...
l'll kill you.

777
01:02:22,338 --> 01:02:23,805
Oh No! This isn't our home!

778
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:26,465
Hey Kamalhasan! Come in.

779
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:30,606
Finding you putting a motif,
l thought l entered wrong house.

780
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:32,179
How did you get
this great idea?

781
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:33,541
What's so great in it?

782
01:02:33,783 --> 01:02:34,807
Women have to put designs
in the forecourt...

783
01:02:35,051 --> 01:02:35,745
Men must gulp down pegs!

784
01:02:36,052 --> 01:02:38,680
Don't take it easy.
Putting designs is very difficult.

785
01:02:38,821 --> 01:02:41,847
Okay, it's great and Anu is much
greater for designing it.

786
01:02:41,958 --> 01:02:43,721
Why are you taunting Anu?

787
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:46,224
l'm not taunting her but showing
her how to put designs.

788
01:02:46,395 --> 01:02:47,453
Let me see how you do it.

789
01:02:47,663 --> 01:02:50,063
You'll break your back and
take bed rest for a week.

790
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:53,493
After hearing this we mustn't
take it easily,

791
01:02:53,703 --> 01:02:54,431
we must do it and show them.

792
01:02:55,571 --> 01:02:56,196
Take this.

793
01:03:02,712 --> 01:03:04,373
Look, don't underestimate him.

794
01:03:13,923 --> 01:03:15,185
l've not yet finished it.

795
01:03:17,894 --> 01:03:18,485
Go man!

796
01:03:23,533 --> 01:03:26,934
Nothing...l want to know who
started this design making.

797
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:27,864
We women!

798
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:31,504
Looking at the stars,
anyway it's impossible to join them,

799
01:03:31,607 --> 01:03:33,768
they drew the stars on the
ground and joined them.

800
01:03:34,243 --> 01:03:35,232
They ended up as designs.

801
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:41,545
Now what do you say?

802
01:03:44,053 --> 01:03:46,920
This will look more beautiful
on Katrina Kaif's dress.

803
01:03:50,259 --> 01:03:53,592
l like man who can put designs,
because l can't do it.

804
01:03:53,796 --> 01:03:56,321
But women who can't put designs...

805
01:03:56,465 --> 01:03:57,056
You like them?

806
01:03:57,266 --> 01:03:57,925
l hate them.

807
01:04:04,774 --> 01:04:06,401
l wanted to know the brand...

808
01:04:06,642 --> 01:04:07,768
Why are you bothered
about the brand?

809
01:04:07,977 --> 01:04:09,069
But the girl is firebrand!

810
01:04:18,421 --> 01:04:20,321
l'm thinking of changing this set up.

811
01:04:20,489 --> 01:04:22,889
What's this? You just
started with Rathalu...

812
01:04:23,125 --> 01:04:26,583
Bloody fool! You've grown
tall like light house,

813
01:04:26,963 --> 01:04:28,260
but absolutely no brain.

814
01:04:28,497 --> 01:04:30,761
You couldn't get that girl from Venu,

815
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:33,365
you made me a fool before JP,

816
01:04:33,669 --> 01:04:37,730
no use in depending on you,
l'll enter the arena myself.

817
01:04:39,008 --> 01:04:42,000
l'll chew that Venu like chilly fry.

818
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:50,413
We both look very ordinary,

819
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:52,077
but very hot and spicy to eat.

820
01:04:52,321 --> 01:04:55,449
lf you eat chilly in jealous,
it'll burn your stomach.

821
01:04:56,092 --> 01:04:56,581
Eat!

822
01:04:58,661 --> 01:05:02,153
You said you'll chew him up!
Come on go ahead and bite.

823
01:05:04,667 --> 01:05:05,998
Where are you running away man?

824
01:05:06,202 --> 01:05:07,396
You'l beat me if l stay here, so...

825
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:10,262
lf you know l'll beat, you should
be knowing the reason for it also.

826
01:05:10,473 --> 01:05:13,340
Okay, l'll not beat you. l'll offer
a chilly fry, tell me the truth.

827
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:15,005
l'll tell brother,

828
01:05:15,144 --> 01:05:19,171
Simhachalam told to wait outside
your home and kill Anu.

829
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:24,951
You've told the truth
for a chilly fry,

830
01:05:25,321 --> 01:05:27,516
lf he had beat him, he would've
planted a bomb in your pocket.

831
01:05:28,224 --> 01:05:30,988
Actually l came here to know
Arun's whereabouts.

832
01:05:31,193 --> 01:05:32,285
But he told me a different thing.

833
01:05:32,962 --> 01:05:35,123
That means you're
still trying to kill Anu.

834
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:37,392
lf you interfere in Anu's life again,

835
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:39,234
your name will vanish
from Vizag voter's list,

836
01:05:39,468 --> 01:05:40,298
you'll float in the backwaters!

837
01:05:40,569 --> 01:05:43,299
l'm giving you one day's time,
tell me Arun's whereabouts.

838
01:06:17,206 --> 01:06:18,264
l know about you.

839
01:06:19,108 --> 01:06:21,474
l don't know about you and
l don't want to know also.

840
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:23,578
JP's son's lover is with you,

841
01:06:24,113 --> 01:06:25,512
you are in way
connected to her,

842
01:06:26,082 --> 01:06:27,379
Handover her to me.

843
01:06:28,117 --> 01:06:29,550
Are you JP's henchman?

844
01:06:29,919 --> 01:06:31,887
You too have no connection
with that girl, go away.

845
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:33,451
How do l look like to you?

846
01:06:36,759 --> 01:06:39,694
Apply oil to your hair,
have a neat shave.

847
01:06:39,862 --> 01:06:40,794
Then you'll be visible.

848
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:44,565
Are you going overboard
because it's your area?

849
01:06:44,767 --> 01:06:48,328
l'll come to your area, your den
putting my feet on your chest,

850
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:49,300
l'll talk to you like this.

851
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:52,201
l think you don't know
my style and strength.

852
01:06:52,441 --> 01:06:55,501
l know how bring her to me.

853
01:06:55,778 --> 01:06:58,611
Release her or else both
will die brutally.

854
01:06:58,914 --> 01:07:03,476
Don't forget, l'm Durga!

855
01:07:04,487 --> 01:07:05,579
Go man!

856
01:07:11,927 --> 01:07:13,394
You don't know about me.

857
01:07:13,996 --> 01:07:15,486
Showing off too much!

858
01:07:16,465 --> 01:07:17,830
l'll show you my real self.

859
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:35,417
Who are you?

860
01:07:38,087 --> 01:07:39,111
Where are your parents?

861
01:07:41,357 --> 01:07:42,016
Leave me.

862
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:43,953
Who are you?

863
01:07:44,193 --> 01:07:44,921
What's this injustice?

864
01:07:45,995 --> 01:07:46,757
Dear...

865
01:07:55,805 --> 01:07:56,464
Mother!

866
01:08:00,276 --> 01:08:00,935
Mother!

867
01:08:06,582 --> 01:08:07,571
Where is your daughter?

868
01:08:07,883 --> 01:08:08,713
l don't know.

869
01:08:08,951 --> 01:08:10,282
You shouldn't say like that.

870
01:08:10,619 --> 01:08:11,984
You must say she's with Venu.

871
01:08:12,388 --> 01:08:13,980
We don't have any
relationship with her.

872
01:08:14,723 --> 01:08:18,022
No relationship? You'll not say...

873
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:19,727
lsn't she telling you?
Can't you understand?

874
01:08:25,167 --> 01:08:25,963
Father!

875
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:28,532
What does he think of himself?
Getting angry on me.

876
01:08:28,704 --> 01:08:30,137
Am l his student?
