1
00:01:14,525 --> 00:01:17,022
Davinder, come and have some tea.

2
00:01:25,066 --> 00:01:27,252
Take these two dresses with shawls.

3
00:01:27,276 --> 00:01:29,945
I have worn them only twice.

4
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:32,033
Thank you, ma'am.

5
00:01:32,255 --> 00:01:35,263
I am only surviving
because I have your support.

6
00:01:36,016 --> 00:01:39,212
Otherwise, I don't know
where I had to wander to survive.

7
00:01:39,236 --> 00:01:41,258
Any news about your husband?

8
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,804
No, ma'am. No news yet.

9
00:01:43,976 --> 00:01:48,995
That incident is like a nightmare to me.

10
00:01:58,092 --> 00:01:59,654
What happened, Davinder?

11
00:01:59,678 --> 00:02:01,846
I don't know. I feel like vomiting.

12
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,307
Are you feeling alright?

13
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:05,839
I'll go and get the medicine
from the station doctor.

14
00:02:05,863 --> 00:02:08,289
No need for any medicine.

15
00:02:08,751 --> 00:02:10,838
Get some raw mangoes on
your way back from the field.

16
00:02:10,862 --> 00:02:12,661
I feel like have something sour.

17
00:02:12,685 --> 00:02:14,486
Raw mangoes, huh?

18
00:02:15,306 --> 00:02:17,973
You have made me so happy,
Davinder Kaur!

19
00:02:20,584 --> 00:02:23,359
"Your beloved has bought a new truck."

20
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:25,352
Someone's in a happy mood.

21
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:28,278
Who's the singer?
Someone like Shinda?

22
00:02:28,613 --> 00:02:30,714
You are going to be a grandfather.

23
00:02:30,738 --> 00:02:33,860
I'll go to Ferozpur
and get sweets for everyone.

24
00:02:33,983 --> 00:02:36,454
We have come here to
discuss something else.

25
00:02:36,478 --> 00:02:38,662
You harvested crops
on the field as you liked...

26
00:02:38,686 --> 00:02:40,821
...while my brother
and his wife was alive.

27
00:02:40,845 --> 00:02:43,060
We never asked you
for a share or a rent.

28
00:02:43,084 --> 00:02:44,638
But it is difficult
to continue with that.

29
00:02:44,662 --> 00:02:47,779
If you heed our advice then
we shall continue to be amicable.

30
00:02:47,803 --> 00:02:50,950
Our sister will still have
a place she can call her parental home.

31
00:02:50,974 --> 00:02:56,222
You know it's not right for a husband to
stay in his wife's parental home for long.

32
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,963
Father, did you see the
consequences of nurturing a snake?

33
00:03:05,987 --> 00:03:09,540
I had told you we should have killed
uncle's daughter when she was a child.

34
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:14,724
If she gives birth to a son
then he will challenge our children.

35
00:03:15,098 --> 00:03:20,386
Englishmen have left our country, but
not before teaching us a trick or two.

36
00:03:37,127 --> 00:03:38,233
Oh my God.

37
00:03:38,473 --> 00:03:39,795
What is wrong?

38
00:03:40,058 --> 00:03:41,438
Did something happen?

39
00:03:41,462 --> 00:03:42,817
What do I say?

40
00:03:42,897 --> 00:03:45,769
I didn't get any share
in the land back in the village.

41
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:49,377
Davinder's uncle wants me
to let go of this land as well.

42
00:03:49,671 --> 00:03:53,540
I cannot interfere
in your family matters.

43
00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:56,887
But yes, I can offer you a job.

44
00:03:57,077 --> 00:04:00,144
You can later take
an acre of land on rent.

45
00:04:08,407 --> 00:04:12,503
'Where did he go this early
in the morning without informing me?'

46
00:04:27,447 --> 00:04:28,752
Hello, brother.

47
00:04:30,201 --> 00:04:32,349
Hello is fine.

48
00:04:33,358 --> 00:04:36,656
But the brother part
doesn't sound right.

49
00:04:36,841 --> 00:04:38,281
He is not at home.

50
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:40,283
And he hasn't told
me when will he return.

51
00:04:40,307 --> 00:04:42,265
That's why I am here.

52
00:04:42,503 --> 00:04:43,682
He is not here.

53
00:04:43,706 --> 00:04:48,269
And it is not easy for him
to come back from where he has gone.

54
00:04:48,396 --> 00:04:49,881
What do you mean?

55
00:04:50,593 --> 00:04:52,423
I mean...

56
00:05:01,563 --> 00:05:03,170
Get him! Don't let him escape.

57
00:05:03,194 --> 00:05:04,920
Where do you think you are going?

58
00:05:04,944 --> 00:05:07,724
- What is wrong?
- We will let you know.

59
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,144
You are carrying a
kilo of heroin with you...

60
00:05:12,168 --> 00:05:13,468
...and you are asking me what is wrong?

61
00:05:13,492 --> 00:05:14,871
I didn't know that it is heroin.

62
00:05:14,895 --> 00:05:16,298
Muktaria asked me to get it.

63
00:05:16,322 --> 00:05:19,302
We have been asked to
arrest you by our officer.

64
00:05:19,326 --> 00:05:21,808
He is my friend.
You are lying.

65
00:05:22,381 --> 00:05:25,325
He will rot in prison
for the rest of his life.

66
00:05:25,602 --> 00:05:28,641
Someone will have to
take care of you as well.

67
00:05:28,836 --> 00:05:32,370
Seems like I will have
to take up that responsibility.

68
00:05:33,242 --> 00:05:35,462
Imagine what he will do
to you when he learns about this.

69
00:05:35,486 --> 00:05:37,892
He will only learn about
it if he gets to come here.

70
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:41,216
Now no one can stop
me from making you mine.

71
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:44,875
You cannot escape us!

72
00:05:49,067 --> 00:05:50,886
Get him!

73
00:05:52,232 --> 00:05:53,431
- Come on!
- Let me go!

74
00:05:53,455 --> 00:05:54,655
Don't feel shy.

75
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:56,600
You cannot escape us!

76
00:06:04,473 --> 00:06:06,248
Get him! Don't let him escape!

77
00:06:06,272 --> 00:06:07,513
Let me go!

78
00:06:08,315 --> 00:06:09,315
Leave me!

79
00:06:13,149 --> 00:06:17,572
Someone who can betray
like this cannot be my friend.

80
00:06:17,652 --> 00:06:20,485
You filthy dog!

81
00:06:46,832 --> 00:06:50,294
Seems like the inspector is dead.

82
00:06:53,058 --> 00:06:54,058
Let's go.

83
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:58,102
Take him along.

84
00:06:58,275 --> 00:06:59,275
Get him.

85
00:06:59,276 --> 00:07:01,609
He thinks he's some dangerous goon.

86
00:07:03,017 --> 00:07:04,697
You will get hanged now.

87
00:07:04,829 --> 00:07:06,762
You have killed an inspector.

88
00:07:24,552 --> 00:07:26,943
Get him!
You cannot escape us!

89
00:07:43,143 --> 00:07:44,583
Hurry up, brother.

90
00:07:44,724 --> 00:07:46,524
The train is about to come.

91
00:07:46,826 --> 00:07:49,159
I treated you two like my brothers.

92
00:07:49,331 --> 00:07:51,164
You are behaving like my enemies.

93
00:07:51,188 --> 00:07:54,163
This is how you are repaying
me for being a sister?

94
00:07:54,187 --> 00:07:56,967
Sister, your parents are alone up there.

95
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:59,042
They must be missing you.

96
00:07:59,256 --> 00:08:00,723
Goodbye, sister.

97
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,581
May God be with you.

98
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:05,412
- Please forgive me.
- Let's go.

99
00:08:15,321 --> 00:08:16,737
Oh, my God.

100
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:18,906
Who tied this girl here?

101
00:08:28,353 --> 00:08:30,731
Who tied you here?
Who did this?

102
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:32,611
I will tell you everything.

103
00:08:32,973 --> 00:08:35,300
Let's leave before
those devils come back.

104
00:08:35,324 --> 00:08:36,684
Hurry up. Get up.

105
00:08:37,061 --> 00:08:38,703
Come on, hurry up.

106
00:08:39,922 --> 00:08:41,689
Come on, let's go quickly.

107
00:08:42,408 --> 00:08:44,888
Who were they?
Who tied you down?

108
00:08:52,982 --> 00:08:54,119
Aunt!

109
00:08:54,264 --> 00:08:58,999
Dear, how many times do I need
to tell you not to carry heavy things?

110
00:08:59,515 --> 00:09:01,978
Look at your condition.

111
00:09:05,489 --> 00:09:09,341
Aunt, I wonder what great
I did in the past to deserve this.

112
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:14,049
You are working for others to feed me.

113
00:09:14,129 --> 00:09:15,799
I have no family.

114
00:09:15,971 --> 00:09:18,638
I took you in for
my own selfish reasons.

115
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:21,533
So that there is someone
who will cry after I die.

116
00:09:21,557 --> 00:09:23,964
What are you saying, aunt?

117
00:09:25,647 --> 00:09:26,809
No, dear.

118
00:09:27,294 --> 00:09:28,894
You should be happy.

119
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:31,979
We are soon going to
be blessed with a child.

120
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,572
Why is my darling son crying?

121
00:09:41,968 --> 00:09:44,233
Who has hit my handsome boy?

122
00:09:44,652 --> 00:09:47,490
We will beat that person up.

123
00:09:50,169 --> 00:09:54,014
Oh blessed one, I am all yours now.

124
00:09:54,575 --> 00:09:57,706
And you are all mine.

125
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,060
It's a boy, girl.

126
00:10:02,187 --> 00:10:03,584
Why are you still sad?

127
00:10:03,608 --> 00:10:06,139
"Don't celebrate when you have a son."

128
00:10:06,163 --> 00:10:07,416
"When it's a boy."

129
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,709
"Don't celebrate when you have a son."

130
00:10:09,733 --> 00:10:12,616
"You will always be crying."

131
00:10:12,774 --> 00:10:16,561
"It is not easy to deal with sons."

132
00:10:16,641 --> 00:10:17,955
"It is not easy."

133
00:10:17,979 --> 00:10:20,547
"It is not easy."

134
00:10:20,627 --> 00:10:22,002
"It is not easy."

135
00:10:24,352 --> 00:10:26,146
Auntie, Jogga is my classmate.

136
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,170
Really?

137
00:10:27,171 --> 00:10:28,978
May God bless you both with success.

138
00:10:29,002 --> 00:10:31,069
Bye, ma'am. I'll get going now.

139
00:10:32,097 --> 00:10:35,297
It's time for Jogga's school.
I need to make lunch.

140
00:10:35,744 --> 00:10:37,192
Hurry up.

141
00:10:37,507 --> 00:10:39,265
First give me two.

142
00:10:48,401 --> 00:10:50,268
Jagga is staring at us, man.

143
00:10:55,618 --> 00:10:56,658
You want one?

144
00:10:58,403 --> 00:10:59,433
Have it.

145
00:11:00,171 --> 00:11:01,617
Come on, have it.

146
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,004
Pay up, kids.

147
00:11:07,443 --> 00:11:09,684
We don't have any money at the moment.

148
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:10,830
You can take it tomorrow morning.

149
00:11:10,854 --> 00:11:12,801
Tomorrow morning, right!
How will you pay him tomorrow?

150
00:11:12,825 --> 00:11:15,625
Why don't you pay
him if you are that rich?

151
00:11:19,543 --> 00:11:22,345
Kids, did you see someone running away?

152
00:11:22,425 --> 00:11:25,499
I did. But you will need
to pay to get the information.

153
00:11:25,523 --> 00:11:26,883
I'll need to pay?

154
00:11:28,473 --> 00:11:31,307
He entered that house.

155
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,300
Give it to me.

156
00:11:39,884 --> 00:11:41,208
What is your name?

157
00:11:41,232 --> 00:11:43,704
Battery.
Everyone calls me Battery.

158
00:11:43,838 --> 00:11:45,278
Where do you stay?

159
00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:48,573
I don't have any parents.
So, how can I have a home?

160
00:11:50,067 --> 00:11:51,446
What work do you do?

161
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,671
I serve tea at the tea shall.
I also serve lunch at the restaurant.

162
00:11:53,695 --> 00:11:55,395
I also wash utensils if asked.

163
00:11:55,494 --> 00:12:00,097
If you have any work
then I can do it for you.

164
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:02,098
But you should let me
play with you in the evenings.

165
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:03,328
Come, sit down.

166
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:07,103
Gabby and I have already
purchased movie tickets.

167
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:09,660
You two don't want to watch the movie?

168
00:12:12,411 --> 00:12:14,293
Mother, have you made tea?

169
00:12:14,429 --> 00:12:16,109
I'll make it right away.

170
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,852
I need money to watch a movie.

171
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:24,031
Son, I barely manage to pay
the school fees and run the house.

172
00:12:24,111 --> 00:12:25,794
You should be considerate.

173
00:12:25,818 --> 00:12:28,675
I don't care. The whole school
is going to watch the movie.

174
00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:33,088
You start making excuses
whenever I ask for money.

175
00:12:33,536 --> 00:12:38,316
Son, only the rich go
to theatre to watch a movie.

176
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:42,035
Their father earn, and your father...

177
00:12:42,506 --> 00:12:45,899
And where is my father?
Is he dead or alive?

178
00:12:49,514 --> 00:12:51,004
'Oh, my God.'

179
00:12:51,322 --> 00:12:56,146
'Who do I share my sorrows with?'
'I just had aunt and she is no more.'

180
00:12:56,226 --> 00:12:59,023
I will talk to the restaurant
owner and asked him to give me money...

181
00:12:59,047 --> 00:13:00,999
...instead of food
for the next few days.

182
00:13:01,023 --> 00:13:03,773
Don't stop eating just to watch a movie.

183
00:13:04,157 --> 00:13:08,046
You can take my ticket, Jogga. I don't
feel like watching the movie anyway.

184
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:10,970
And where will get
the other two tickets from?

185
00:13:11,102 --> 00:13:15,651
Jogga, should we go to
the policeman we met yesterday?

186
00:13:16,126 --> 00:13:19,050
Friendly policemen,
disloyal women, bad cars...

187
00:13:19,074 --> 00:13:22,462
...and damaged weapons
will always betray you.

188
00:13:24,732 --> 00:13:25,751
Let's go.

189
00:13:28,636 --> 00:13:30,969
- Where did they go?
- I don't know.

190
00:13:35,527 --> 00:13:39,485
We will have fresh samosas
and hot tea during the interval.

191
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,819
Jagga, we had decided.

192
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,680
That side of the tracks
is yours and this side is mine.

193
00:13:52,681 --> 00:13:54,581
I took the goods from my area.

194
00:13:54,629 --> 00:13:58,357
Forget the area.
Jagga likes to snatch things away.

195
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:15,126
Hit him!

196
00:14:15,206 --> 00:14:16,835
Don't let him escape.

197
00:14:16,859 --> 00:14:18,792
Where are you running off to?

198
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,420
You are stealing things?

199
00:14:23,774 --> 00:14:26,174
I'll take you to the police station.

200
00:14:28,704 --> 00:14:30,384
Who are you staring at?

201
00:14:33,321 --> 00:14:35,654
That little dog has killed me hard!

202
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,413
You are hiding over here?

203
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,669
Why did you have to mess with a cop?

204
00:14:43,693 --> 00:14:46,340
Cops have gone to your
homes looking for you.

205
00:14:46,364 --> 00:14:48,459
Who told them where we stay?

206
00:14:48,695 --> 00:14:51,417
I think Jagga is behind this.

207
00:14:51,497 --> 00:14:52,937
He is the one who came
to snatch the money.

208
00:14:52,961 --> 00:14:54,185
Go and call Gabby.

209
00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:55,569
We will run away.

210
00:14:55,756 --> 00:14:59,697
Gabby and I didn't hurt him.
Why should we run with you?

211
00:15:37,217 --> 00:15:38,217
Pay up.

212
00:15:38,218 --> 00:15:39,658
We don't have any.

213
00:15:39,713 --> 00:15:41,243
Do you think this
belongs to your father?

214
00:15:41,267 --> 00:15:43,067
Don't talk about my father.

215
00:15:43,398 --> 00:15:45,931
Tell me, if I can do any work for you.

216
00:15:48,142 --> 00:15:50,089
Why are you fighting with the kids?

217
00:15:50,113 --> 00:15:51,313
Take the money.

218
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:52,824
Let's go, boys.

219
00:16:06,602 --> 00:16:09,058
Go and rest, boys.

220
00:16:12,852 --> 00:16:15,719
How are you doing, boys?
Did you sleep well?

221
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,401
I hope you didn't face any problem.

222
00:16:17,425 --> 00:16:18,425
No, uncle.

223
00:16:18,495 --> 00:16:21,670
Don't address me as uncle.
Else, we won't get along.

224
00:16:21,694 --> 00:16:22,694
It's Baiji.

225
00:16:22,939 --> 00:16:23,946
Okay, Baiji.

226
00:16:25,301 --> 00:16:26,841
Get the tea.

227
00:16:55,363 --> 00:16:56,608
Give us the goods.

228
00:16:56,632 --> 00:16:57,709
Give us the money.

229
00:16:57,733 --> 00:16:59,093
The goods, first.

230
00:16:59,161 --> 00:17:00,333
The money, first.

231
00:17:00,357 --> 00:17:01,557
You want money?

232
00:17:01,637 --> 00:17:03,370
Snatch the goods from him.

233
00:17:09,483 --> 00:17:12,383
Catch those scoundrels.
Don't let them escape.

234
00:17:26,287 --> 00:17:27,577
Well done, boys.

235
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,929
This was a test.

236
00:17:30,136 --> 00:17:31,736
You have cleared it.

237
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:33,372
They were my men.

238
00:17:34,593 --> 00:17:36,113
Keep this with you.

239
00:17:36,203 --> 00:17:39,022
That is your reward.
Your pocket money.

240
00:17:43,668 --> 00:17:44,904
Oh no.

241
00:17:49,904 --> 00:17:52,336
There it goes.

242
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,023
Listen to me.

243
00:18:16,714 --> 00:18:19,150
Come on Battery, that was a bad joke.

244
00:18:19,174 --> 00:18:20,333
Tell us if you have a better one.

245
00:18:20,357 --> 00:18:22,169
Battery, you lie a lot.

246
00:18:23,776 --> 00:18:25,456
There comes the call.

247
00:18:27,572 --> 00:18:28,659
Hello?

248
00:18:30,608 --> 00:18:31,662
Okay, Baiji.

249
00:18:33,062 --> 00:18:34,742
Let's go then, brother.

250
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:40,105
"When they grew up..."
"They went wild, my dear."

251
00:18:40,465 --> 00:18:46,343
"When they grew up..."
"They went wild, my dear."

252
00:18:46,423 --> 00:18:50,727
"My dear, the boys without
parents went out of control."

253
00:18:51,098 --> 00:18:53,481
"Parents..."

254
00:19:13,642 --> 00:19:17,610
Give the money from one hand
and take the goods from the other.

255
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,361
We have given you top quality stuff.

256
00:19:29,385 --> 00:19:30,947
I hope all the money is in it.

257
00:19:30,971 --> 00:19:33,262
Trust is important in a business,
my friend.

258
00:19:33,286 --> 00:19:36,742
It doesn't matter whether
the business is legal or not.

259
00:19:48,339 --> 00:19:49,397
Come, boys.

260
00:19:49,477 --> 00:19:51,364
You have come at the right time.

261
00:19:51,388 --> 00:19:53,648
Sit and have dinner first.

262
00:20:02,415 --> 00:20:03,535
Yes, Mr. Khan.

263
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,700
Khan said that you
gave them fake currency.

264
00:20:11,021 --> 00:20:12,896
Yes Baiji, we did.

265
00:20:13,774 --> 00:20:18,491
People in this business
trust me blindly.

266
00:20:19,064 --> 00:20:20,864
What you did was not right.

267
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,081
Have you lost your mind?
Do you have a death wish?

268
00:20:24,105 --> 00:20:27,428
I will die only if it is drugs.
It is salt.

269
00:20:27,587 --> 00:20:30,228
How did you know that
this isn't real stuff?

270
00:20:30,252 --> 00:20:34,348
We have bribed one of Khan's men.
He had informed us before hand.

271
00:20:34,448 --> 00:20:37,636
Baiji, I suggest we should
start our own business.

272
00:20:38,152 --> 00:20:41,146
Khan is the uncrowned
king of this business.

273
00:20:42,058 --> 00:20:46,602
And one needs loads of money to
do business at such a large scale, boys.

274
00:20:46,698 --> 00:20:49,939
Baiji, once the car is in the
right direction speed is your control.

275
00:20:49,963 --> 00:20:52,863
All you have to do
is step on the accelerator.

276
00:20:54,303 --> 00:20:55,749
Keep this with you.

277
00:20:55,773 --> 00:20:58,786
There is risk at every
step in what you are about to do.

278
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:03,957
Be it in gambling,
business, hitting a sixer or cards...

279
00:21:04,122 --> 00:21:06,922
One has to take a
risk to score big, Baiji.

280
00:21:24,803 --> 00:21:28,737
"It was them against the world."

281
00:21:28,817 --> 00:21:33,892
"It was them against the world."
"They ended up thrashing a cop."

282
00:21:34,045 --> 00:21:36,925
"The police kept looking for them."

283
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:39,563
"And they kept plundering."

284
00:21:39,643 --> 00:21:42,701
"And they kept plundering."

285
00:22:03,601 --> 00:22:06,016
Brother, no one will give them a lift.

286
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,973
It is an isolated road.
They have a woman and a child with them.

287
00:22:08,997 --> 00:22:11,197
Why don't we give them our bike?

288
00:22:11,277 --> 00:22:12,514
You are feeling very generous?

289
00:22:12,538 --> 00:22:15,405
Police will get back
to us through the bike.

290
00:22:44,349 --> 00:22:48,555
Three goons steal a businessman's
car and cash in broad daylight...

291
00:22:48,579 --> 00:22:53,925
...when he was going out
with his wife and child.

292
00:22:54,114 --> 00:22:55,977
No, Baiji. No drinks.

293
00:22:56,057 --> 00:22:57,754
Otherwise,
we won't be able to get up early.

294
00:22:57,778 --> 00:22:59,892
Where you do want to
go early in the morning?

295
00:22:59,916 --> 00:23:01,783
Rajasthan, to get the stuff.

296
00:23:02,217 --> 00:23:05,017
At least let the matter
cool down a little.

297
00:23:05,195 --> 00:23:07,904
Police is searching
every nook and corner.

298
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,822
And they have managed to trace your car.

299
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:10,916
It's not a big deal.

300
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,878
We will change the number plate.

301
00:23:12,902 --> 00:23:16,358
Not just the number plate,
let's change the car itself.

302
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:59,209
If there stuff has any impurities...

303
00:23:59,607 --> 00:24:02,306
...we will kill you and
bury you in these sand dunes.

304
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:03,810
Keep this toy inside, man.

305
00:24:03,834 --> 00:24:05,728
When I can get the stuff
from across the border...

306
00:24:05,752 --> 00:24:07,422
You are yet to see my weapons.

307
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,126
I have automatic ones.

308
00:24:21,022 --> 00:24:23,012
Check if all the money is in it.

309
00:24:23,036 --> 00:24:24,053
Be careful on the way.

310
00:24:24,077 --> 00:24:25,404
There are many check posts on the way.

311
00:24:25,428 --> 00:24:27,266
I won't be responsible
if you get caught.

312
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:29,557
Let's go, uncle. We are done here.

313
00:25:05,002 --> 00:25:06,588
- Stop. Stop. Stop.
- Stop. Stop. Stop.

314
00:25:06,612 --> 00:25:07,612
Pull over.

315
00:25:07,897 --> 00:25:08,897
Pull over.

316
00:25:08,898 --> 00:25:10,578
Pull over to this side.

317
00:25:17,822 --> 00:25:19,168
There is nothing in there, sir.

318
00:25:19,192 --> 00:25:20,632
The jeep is empty.

319
00:25:25,492 --> 00:25:28,520
Have some standards, sir.

320
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:45,260
Where is the stuff?

321
00:25:45,284 --> 00:25:47,017
I had kept it in the boot.

322
00:26:14,682 --> 00:26:16,008
Give it here.

323
00:26:34,698 --> 00:26:38,073
Why did you hide the stuff
in the trolley full of hay?

324
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:41,354
We feared the one who gave
us the goods might get us arrested.

325
00:26:41,378 --> 00:26:42,725
We were sleeping.

326
00:26:42,749 --> 00:26:45,730
Even we didn't realise when
he stuffed it to the trolley.

327
00:26:45,754 --> 00:26:47,755
The car stopped, I opened my eyes.

328
00:26:47,779 --> 00:26:50,246
I thought that he had stopped to pee.

329
00:26:50,298 --> 00:26:52,343
What about the cops at the check post?

330
00:26:52,367 --> 00:26:53,367
The cops?

331
00:27:09,123 --> 00:27:11,698
Don't you think Khan
Bhai would object this?

332
00:27:11,722 --> 00:27:13,397
You have managed to
get the stuff this time.

333
00:27:13,421 --> 00:27:16,018
But what is the guarantee that you will
be able to get it next time as well?

334
00:27:16,042 --> 00:27:18,436
There is no guarantee of life either,
Mr. Ansari.

335
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:21,249
Who knows whether we
will take our next breath?

336
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:23,911
If we stay breathing,
we will get the goods.

337
00:27:23,935 --> 00:27:26,036
Khan Bhai has contacts in the capital.

338
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:29,623
You need to assure us that we will
be able to sell without restrictions.

339
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:32,419
How will we benefit
working with you anyway?

340
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:36,165
We are charging half
the price Khan does.

341
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:41,348
All those who agree to the terms
pay the advance and collect the stuff.

342
00:27:41,372 --> 00:27:47,282
You will soon know who is
selling sand and who is selling gold.

343
00:27:48,931 --> 00:27:52,970
Khan Bhai,
Karaj is trying to steal your position.

344
00:27:55,344 --> 00:27:57,024
Who delivered the stuff?

345
00:27:57,161 --> 00:28:01,147
Those three boys who gave
fake currency to your men.

346
00:28:05,115 --> 00:28:09,647
Many dealers took stuff from Karaj
because he is charging half the price.

347
00:28:09,671 --> 00:28:12,785
Your business will
go bust if this continues.

348
00:28:18,672 --> 00:28:23,967
You burn your tongue if you
have something too hot, Mr. Yadav.

349
00:28:28,479 --> 00:28:30,468
Hello, ACP?

350
00:28:31,115 --> 00:28:32,999
How are you doing?

351
00:28:35,305 --> 00:28:36,770
How are you, Mr. Karaj?

352
00:28:36,794 --> 00:28:39,327
Welcome, inspector.
Please have a seat.

353
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:44,803
There is a report that a
huge consignment of heroin is here.

354
00:28:44,827 --> 00:28:46,050
White gold.

355
00:28:46,172 --> 00:28:50,471
I came to inform you
because we go way back.

356
00:28:53,238 --> 00:28:56,571
Your three boys are getting
very famous in Delhi.

357
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,843
We have orders to arrest him.

358
00:29:01,935 --> 00:29:03,375
Who reported this?

359
00:29:05,509 --> 00:29:07,109
You know everything.

360
00:29:07,436 --> 00:29:08,436
Khan.

361
00:29:14,765 --> 00:29:16,700
Your crime list is way long.

362
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,252
Be careful.

363
00:29:18,973 --> 00:29:21,306
You have many admirers in the city.

364
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:26,875
Come, boys.

365
00:29:28,868 --> 00:29:31,601
Boys, why don't you
go out for a few days?

366
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:33,868
Khan is trying his best.

367
00:29:34,227 --> 00:29:36,034
Let's go to Goa, brother.

368
00:29:36,959 --> 00:29:38,534
Let's go to Goa then.

369
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:41,025
How long will it take to reach there?

370
00:29:41,889 --> 00:29:45,829
Get in the car and I'll
get you to Goa overnight.

371
00:30:19,782 --> 00:30:21,407
Where have we reached, Jogga?

372
00:30:21,431 --> 00:30:23,146
We have just entered Goa.

373
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:27,250
This road looks just
like the one in our city.

374
00:30:28,056 --> 00:30:29,191
I agree.

375
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:34,785
Oh damn.

376
00:30:34,865 --> 00:30:37,611
There is an Uddam Singh
Chowk in Goa as well?

377
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:39,483
Goa is doing great.

378
00:30:42,326 --> 00:30:45,186
Brother, where's the sea?

379
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,240
Why? Do you want to catch fishes?

380
00:30:54,465 --> 00:30:57,409
Now don't say there
is no Baghdadi gate in Goa.

381
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:29,573
Where had you gone, Jogga?

382
00:31:29,597 --> 00:31:31,664
To get Delhi motorboat tickets.

383
00:31:34,909 --> 00:31:35,909
Hello?

384
00:31:36,184 --> 00:31:37,864
Is that Gulinder Singh?

385
00:31:38,224 --> 00:31:39,242
Sir, I had some work with you.

386
00:31:39,266 --> 00:31:40,387
Can we meet?

387
00:31:45,409 --> 00:31:47,849
Jogga said he's take us to Goa
and brought us back to our city instead.

388
00:31:47,873 --> 00:31:49,077
He fooled us.

389
00:31:49,284 --> 00:31:50,866
We let him fool us.

390
00:31:51,236 --> 00:31:52,596
And I enjoyed it.

391
00:31:52,643 --> 00:31:54,243
We had to kill time.

392
00:31:58,206 --> 00:32:00,694
Why are you getting your bones broken?

393
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:02,912
Tell us who all were with you.

394
00:32:03,078 --> 00:32:05,345
Sir, someone has come to meet you.

395
00:32:12,992 --> 00:32:13,992
Hello, sir.

396
00:32:13,993 --> 00:32:15,044
Hello.
Please have a seat.

397
00:32:15,068 --> 00:32:16,826
We had called to let you
know that we wanted to meet.

398
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:17,890
Yes, tell me.

399
00:32:18,292 --> 00:32:20,974
We wanted to get out verification
done for urgent passports.

400
00:32:20,998 --> 00:32:23,117
Send the application to the SSP office.

401
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:25,568
Then find out when the
enquiry reaches our office.

402
00:32:25,592 --> 00:32:27,450
What about the expenses?

403
00:32:28,186 --> 00:32:31,194
Now that you are here,
you might as well pay it.

404
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:35,247
Disloyal women,
bad cars, damaged weapons...

405
00:32:35,327 --> 00:32:38,803
...friendly policemen
will always betray you.

406
00:32:40,248 --> 00:32:41,412
Jogga.

407
00:32:42,845 --> 00:32:43,845
Deepa.

408
00:32:44,383 --> 00:32:45,383
Battery.

409
00:32:47,783 --> 00:32:49,908
Get four cups of tea.

410
00:32:50,348 --> 00:32:52,859
You scoundrels,
you created a scene and left.

411
00:32:52,883 --> 00:32:57,587
Your father kept visiting
us and troubling us every day.

412
00:32:57,667 --> 00:32:59,745
Congratulations on
becoming an inspector.

413
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:00,769
Thank you.

414
00:33:01,299 --> 00:33:02,872
But that's old news.

415
00:33:02,896 --> 00:33:05,160
Tell me,
have you started a new business?

416
00:33:05,184 --> 00:33:07,081
We are into import and
export business in Delhi.

417
00:33:07,105 --> 00:33:10,770
I thought you dogs
must have gone far away.

418
00:33:10,987 --> 00:33:14,999
Yes, life took us far away.

419
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:18,527
Where is Mehak these days?

420
00:33:18,771 --> 00:33:21,529
She is working at Genesis Nursing Home.

421
00:33:22,102 --> 00:33:24,137
She meets sometimes
when she is passing by.

422
00:33:24,161 --> 00:33:25,639
Will you be staying here now?

423
00:33:25,663 --> 00:33:26,711
No.

424
00:33:27,196 --> 00:33:29,482
We have to settle some old scores.

425
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:32,789
Where can we find Jagga?

426
00:33:33,576 --> 00:33:34,576
Jagga?

427
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,848
'Smuggler Kharak Singh
came from Jagravan...'

428
00:33:37,872 --> 00:33:39,803
'...did smuggling near
the border and settled here.'

429
00:33:39,827 --> 00:33:44,301
'His son Nishan Singh Jagravan only
changed his methods and not the business.'

430
00:33:44,325 --> 00:33:49,001
'He smuggled drugs using
a transport business as a cover.'

431
00:33:49,341 --> 00:33:53,212
'And Kharak Singh's grandson, Jagga...'

432
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:59,619
'...had a desire to follow
his grandfather's path.'

433
00:34:00,637 --> 00:34:02,370
What brings you here, sir?

434
00:34:04,138 --> 00:34:06,005
We have purchased this land.

435
00:34:06,415 --> 00:34:07,916
We just came to pay a visit.

436
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,880
The case on the land
is still in the court.

437
00:34:09,904 --> 00:34:11,704
The court is yet to decide.

438
00:34:11,807 --> 00:34:18,398
We paid the money you owned
the moneylender and took the land.

439
00:34:18,763 --> 00:34:21,747
You take the spare
change you want and leave.

440
00:34:21,962 --> 00:34:23,530
You won't anything later.

441
00:34:23,554 --> 00:34:26,196
They have made fake documents
with the help of the record holder.

442
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,910
I am not here to hear your sad story.

443
00:34:29,127 --> 00:34:31,675
Will you walk out
or should I drag you out.

444
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:34,963
I'll rather die than lose
my livelihood for my kids.

445
00:34:44,718 --> 00:34:49,748
You'll need it only
if you have anyone left.

446
00:34:55,711 --> 00:34:57,162
Preeto.

447
00:35:05,134 --> 00:35:06,718
So angry?

448
00:35:08,026 --> 00:35:10,673
Seems like you want to kill me.

449
00:35:11,671 --> 00:35:12,671
You want to?

450
00:35:13,134 --> 00:35:14,734
You want to kill me?

451
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:18,170
Here.

452
00:35:19,018 --> 00:35:20,018
Kill me.

453
00:35:26,221 --> 00:35:32,669
Stupid man,
I just needed your prints on it.

454
00:35:33,021 --> 00:35:35,626
This is an illegal pistol.

455
00:35:36,241 --> 00:35:38,754
He killed his wife, people!

456
00:35:43,086 --> 00:35:45,419
Jagga has become Jagga, the dacoit.

457
00:35:46,198 --> 00:35:47,198
Oh I see.

458
00:35:47,543 --> 00:35:49,867
So he takes over disputed land.

459
00:35:50,019 --> 00:35:53,470
Jagga has his hands
in too many businesses.

460
00:36:13,536 --> 00:36:16,028
Go on.
Keep going back.

461
00:36:26,546 --> 00:36:27,599
Hello, sir.

462
00:36:28,172 --> 00:36:29,746
How are you, Lala?

463
00:36:30,311 --> 00:36:31,991
How's the business doing?

464
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,268
Everything is going well, sir.

465
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:36,025
We have a queue here.

466
00:36:36,505 --> 00:36:37,591
A queue?

467
00:36:38,561 --> 00:36:43,001
It seems like you fill more
trucks than you fill the books.

468
00:36:43,169 --> 00:36:46,154
No, sir.
You can ask your men.

469
00:36:46,281 --> 00:36:48,414
I am not skimming off any money.

470
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:55,026
We wouldn't be troubling
ourselves if the books were right.

471
00:36:55,949 --> 00:36:56,975
No, sir.

472
00:36:57,113 --> 00:36:59,646
Not a single penny is unaccounted for.

473
00:37:00,522 --> 00:37:04,997
We pay monthly bribe to
the traffic police officers.

474
00:37:06,342 --> 00:37:09,769
They give us the exact
count in the evenings.

475
00:37:13,175 --> 00:37:15,349
Do you think this is just sand?

476
00:37:16,094 --> 00:37:21,188
This isn't just sand, it is gold.

477
00:37:21,518 --> 00:37:24,219
And gold is quite expensive.

478
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:36,094
The hand that betrays
us becomes handicap forever.

479
00:37:38,998 --> 00:37:40,278
Forgive me, sir.

480
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:43,240
I made a mistake.
I'll never make such a mistake again.

481
00:37:43,264 --> 00:37:47,616
You should be grateful
that I am letting you live...

482
00:37:48,231 --> 00:37:51,401
...so that when people see you..

483
00:37:51,481 --> 00:37:57,251
..they fear even thinking
about betraying us.

484
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,381
Brother, this looks
like a story of a movie.

485
00:38:07,405 --> 00:38:09,231
You are going to stay in
the city for sometime anyway.

486
00:38:09,255 --> 00:38:10,255
You will soon find out.

487
00:38:10,256 --> 00:38:13,156
Every kid here knows
what Jagga is capable of.

488
00:38:13,386 --> 00:38:15,674
Do mothers scare the kids by saying:

489
00:38:15,698 --> 00:38:18,904
Go to sleep, son, or Jagga will be here.

490
00:38:20,986 --> 00:38:22,666
Do you think I am joking.

491
00:38:22,806 --> 00:38:25,073
No problem.
You will soon find out.

492
00:38:25,245 --> 00:38:27,309
There are many groups
of youngsters in our city...

493
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:30,081
...and they keep
clashing with each other.

494
00:38:31,061 --> 00:38:33,256
Our college is great!

495
00:38:33,376 --> 00:38:35,145
Great!

496
00:38:35,225 --> 00:38:37,359
Long live student union!

497
00:38:37,439 --> 00:38:38,962
Long live!

498
00:38:39,042 --> 00:38:41,277
Long live unity!

499
00:38:41,357 --> 00:38:42,875
Long live!

500
00:38:42,955 --> 00:38:45,041
Our college is great!

501
00:38:45,121 --> 00:38:46,594
Great!

502
00:38:46,674 --> 00:38:48,779
Long live student union!

503
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:50,363
Long live!

504
00:38:50,511 --> 00:38:52,662
Long live unity!

505
00:38:52,742 --> 00:38:54,713
Long live!

506
00:39:05,773 --> 00:39:09,653
Jagga is the one who always
appoints college presidents.

507
00:39:09,856 --> 00:39:13,026
He is your college's
president henceforth.

508
00:39:13,716 --> 00:39:18,373
If anyone have any doubts
or objections then let me know.

509
00:39:20,023 --> 00:39:21,223
Let's go, boys.

510
00:39:33,126 --> 00:39:35,059
Okay then, we will get going.

511
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,792
Look, I know you are
going to do as you please.

512
00:39:38,816 --> 00:39:41,721
But I would still suggest
that you don't mess with Jagga.

513
00:39:41,745 --> 00:39:44,160
He surely has some support behind him.

514
00:39:44,184 --> 00:39:45,184
Support?

515
00:40:05,177 --> 00:40:06,508
Hello, brother.

516
00:40:06,588 --> 00:40:09,128
Come, Jagga.

517
00:40:09,208 --> 00:40:11,511
Where are you these days?
I hardly get to see you.

518
00:40:11,535 --> 00:40:13,412
Just busy with work.

519
00:40:13,718 --> 00:40:15,629
The jobs you have given me.

520
00:40:16,763 --> 00:40:20,963
I thought there is peace in the city
so Jagga must have gone on a vacation.

521
00:40:20,987 --> 00:40:22,352
I don't have the time to, brother.

522
00:40:22,376 --> 00:40:28,664
You should keep a strong hold or else
people start questioning the leaders.

523
00:40:28,992 --> 00:40:30,681
Keep them busy.

524
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:33,203
They will approach us
only if they feel troubled.

525
00:40:33,227 --> 00:40:34,987
And it will keep you entertained.

526
00:40:35,011 --> 00:40:36,543
You are right, brother.

527
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:38,799
What will I do otherwise?

528
00:40:39,016 --> 00:40:41,405
Why have they made me as a MLA?

529
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:42,650
To serve them.

530
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:46,932
I serve everyone well, brother.

531
00:40:47,749 --> 00:40:49,362
They never doubt you again.

532
00:40:49,386 --> 00:40:51,138
How's the business doing otherwise?

533
00:40:51,162 --> 00:40:52,932
Let me know if you
need some pocket money.

534
00:40:52,956 --> 00:40:55,206
I am managing.

535
00:40:55,375 --> 00:40:56,375
With your blessings.

536
00:40:56,376 --> 00:41:00,279
Jagga, you know that the elections
are just around the corner.

537
00:41:00,303 --> 00:41:01,490
It's an expensive affair.

538
00:41:01,514 --> 00:41:04,247
I want my vote bank
to increase this time.

539
00:41:04,383 --> 00:41:06,397
Don't worry, brother.

540
00:41:07,014 --> 00:41:11,839
Whether we need to buy
the votes or force them...

541
00:41:12,346 --> 00:41:13,842
We are all set.

542
00:41:13,963 --> 00:41:16,543
The parking contractor hasn't showed up.

543
00:41:16,567 --> 00:41:18,277
Pull his strings a little.

544
00:41:18,301 --> 00:41:19,981
Fine, I'll handle him.

545
00:41:20,007 --> 00:41:22,401
He cannot escape me.

546
00:41:22,722 --> 00:41:24,619
I know that.

547
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:26,450
Okay then.

548
00:41:26,647 --> 00:41:28,327
We will keep meeting.

549
00:41:36,632 --> 00:41:38,632
I really feel like going home.

550
00:41:39,562 --> 00:41:41,652
I don't know how mother must be doing.

551
00:41:41,676 --> 00:41:43,544
I don't even know if she is alive.

552
00:41:43,568 --> 00:41:46,847
I too want to,
but I am scared of father.

553
00:41:47,736 --> 00:41:51,384
Will we only keep discussing this?
Let's go if we want to!

554
00:42:03,696 --> 00:42:05,401
Come over.
Have tea and then leave.

555
00:42:05,425 --> 00:42:08,225
You have it.
We'll have it some other time.

556
00:42:17,121 --> 00:42:20,021
Son, my eyes are weak.
I didn't recognise you.

557
00:42:20,155 --> 00:42:21,155
Who are you?

558
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,194
It's me, father, Deepa.

559
00:42:25,274 --> 00:42:27,126
- My Deepa?
- Yes, father.

560
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:31,047
- Wait, you scoundrel!
- I'll get hurt, father! Father!

561
00:42:31,071 --> 00:42:33,412
- Wait!
- Listen to me, father!

562
00:42:33,492 --> 00:42:35,962
- I'll get hurt, father!
- Wait!

563
00:42:36,151 --> 00:42:38,368
- Listen to me, father!
- Wait!

564
00:42:38,448 --> 00:42:41,292
He is going to get served well, Battery.

565
00:42:41,587 --> 00:42:42,590
Father!

566
00:42:42,747 --> 00:42:43,747
Father!

567
00:42:43,844 --> 00:42:45,692
You have grown old now.

568
00:42:46,867 --> 00:42:48,934
Stop thrashing me at least now.

569
00:42:49,315 --> 00:42:54,653
Scoundrel, why did you leave
us when you knew I've grown old?

570
00:43:01,253 --> 00:43:02,902
Mother!
Mother!

571
00:43:07,286 --> 00:43:08,286
Mother!

572
00:43:10,055 --> 00:43:11,740
Father, where's mother?

573
00:43:12,678 --> 00:43:16,908
She died waiting for
you and shedding tear for you.

574
00:43:16,988 --> 00:43:18,835
No, father!

575
00:43:34,863 --> 00:43:36,599
It's locked, brother.

576
00:43:45,671 --> 00:43:47,574
Let's ask the neighbours, Battery.

577
00:43:47,598 --> 00:43:48,958
Yes, let's check.

578
00:43:49,728 --> 00:43:52,975
Auntie, a woman used to stay here.

579
00:43:53,055 --> 00:43:54,860
Yes, she used to.

580
00:43:55,175 --> 00:43:59,568
Her son was a wayward,
he left her alone.

581
00:43:59,702 --> 00:44:03,194
Youngsters these days are no good.

582
00:44:03,545 --> 00:44:08,632
We don't even know
whether he is alive or not.

583
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,461
We asked about the woman
who used to live here.

584
00:44:10,485 --> 00:44:11,936
Do you know anything about her?

585
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,000
Where is she?

586
00:44:13,122 --> 00:44:14,382
Where can she go?

587
00:44:14,406 --> 00:44:17,670
She must be washing utensils
at someone's residence.

588
00:44:17,806 --> 00:44:20,786
She has a stomach. She needs to feed it.

589
00:44:53,902 --> 00:44:55,422
Jogga, it that you?

590
00:45:00,529 --> 00:45:01,556
Yes, mother.

591
00:45:11,463 --> 00:45:14,063
Where did you go, leaving me all alone?

592
00:45:16,109 --> 00:45:19,821
You knew I didn't have anyone
other than you in this world.

593
00:45:26,587 --> 00:45:27,587
Battery.

594
00:45:27,824 --> 00:45:29,212
Mother, he is my friend, Battery.

595
00:45:29,236 --> 00:45:30,236
I seek your blessings.

596
00:45:30,237 --> 00:45:31,757
God bless you, son.

597
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:34,143
Let's go inside, son.

598
00:45:39,008 --> 00:45:40,688
Get it here, Battery.

599
00:45:40,944 --> 00:45:42,888
Let's take a nap.

600
00:45:43,556 --> 00:45:44,556
Here son, have some water.

601
00:45:44,557 --> 00:45:45,877
Why are you taking the trouble, mother?

602
00:45:45,901 --> 00:45:46,975
Have a seat.

603
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:50,444
Jogga, whose is that big car?

604
00:45:50,897 --> 00:45:51,937
Ours, mother.

605
00:45:52,222 --> 00:45:53,959
You have a big job?

606
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:55,485
Yes, mother.

607
00:45:55,648 --> 00:45:56,887
A very big job.

608
00:45:57,242 --> 00:46:00,788
He has cars in front of him and
behind him and police all around him.

609
00:46:00,812 --> 00:46:01,812
What? Police?

610
00:46:01,813 --> 00:46:03,609
He means police officers, mother.

611
00:46:03,633 --> 00:46:05,516
I don't understand you kids.

612
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,557
- I'll go make tea for you.
- Sit down, mother.

613
00:46:07,581 --> 00:46:09,021
You must be tired.

614
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:11,730
I won't let you work for others anymore.

615
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:12,888
You have worked enough.

616
00:46:12,912 --> 00:46:16,307
I need to kill time
as long as I am alive, son.

617
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,040
I am so tired, mother.

618
00:46:19,578 --> 00:46:21,799
Can I place my head
on your lap and sleep?

619
00:46:21,823 --> 00:46:22,992
Yes, son.

620
00:46:28,822 --> 00:46:32,037
Massage my head, mother.
I'll go to sleep.

621
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:35,861
Son, when you were small,
you used to go to play...

622
00:46:36,176 --> 00:46:38,493
...and come back tired
to sleep on my lap.

623
00:46:38,517 --> 00:46:42,051
I used to massage your
head and you used to fall asleep.

624
00:46:44,564 --> 00:46:47,411
Son, don't leave me alone.

625
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:50,228
If you leave, then take me along.

626
00:46:51,474 --> 00:46:53,935
Hey, you still haven't
given us the account details.

627
00:46:53,959 --> 00:46:55,608
Brother was asking for it.

628
00:46:55,632 --> 00:46:56,832
I just met him.

629
00:46:57,193 --> 00:47:00,094
Brother, I am short of cash.

630
00:47:00,355 --> 00:47:04,753
Don't you know that I need
to collect and hand over everything...

631
00:47:05,171 --> 00:47:07,140
...in order to meet my ends?

632
00:47:07,273 --> 00:47:08,953
I have so much manpower.

633
00:47:09,109 --> 00:47:11,302
Do you think it is easy to manage them?

634
00:47:11,326 --> 00:47:13,006
You are right, brother.

635
00:47:13,416 --> 00:47:14,902
But others haven't paid me.

636
00:47:14,926 --> 00:47:16,944
Now do you want me to
do your collection for you?

637
00:47:16,968 --> 00:47:20,126
If I get a little easy with you guys,
you start saying your sad stories.

638
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:21,830
When will you pay up?

639
00:47:21,915 --> 00:47:24,815
Or do I need to find
another solution for you?

640
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:27,527
No, brother.
I'll pay by this evening.

641
00:47:28,317 --> 00:47:32,093
I'll sell something if I need to.
I'll make the arrangement.

642
00:47:33,789 --> 00:47:37,609
I think something is
wrong with my horoscope.

643
00:47:38,588 --> 00:47:42,917
Whenever I try to the right thing,
something wrong happens.

644
00:47:43,716 --> 00:47:47,455
And whenever my mind takes the
wrong direction..

645
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:51,851
..things work out right.

646
00:48:01,453 --> 00:48:02,808
Get up, Jogga.

647
00:48:03,374 --> 00:48:04,494
Have some tea.

648
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:14,903
Battery!

649
00:48:15,565 --> 00:48:16,565
Battery!

650
00:48:16,825 --> 00:48:18,174
He's in deep sleep.

651
00:48:18,198 --> 00:48:19,198
Have some tea.

652
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:21,066
Here Battery, have some tea.

653
00:48:25,481 --> 00:48:27,161
I slept so well, Battery.

654
00:48:27,651 --> 00:48:30,467
Brother, I have never
slept so well at night either.

655
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:32,442
A home will always be a home.

656
00:48:32,854 --> 00:48:35,745
You can never get the kind of peaceful
sleep you get at home anywhere else.

657
00:48:35,769 --> 00:48:37,449
You are right, mother.

658
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:41,609
Brother, shall we call Deepa?

659
00:48:42,408 --> 00:48:44,888
I think his father must
have kicked him out this time.

660
00:48:44,912 --> 00:48:46,182
You are right.

661
00:48:48,593 --> 00:48:49,593
How are you?

662
00:48:49,831 --> 00:48:51,964
Survived the thrashing, did you?

663
00:48:53,405 --> 00:48:55,718
Listen, let's go to meet Mehak.

664
00:49:10,403 --> 00:49:12,410
Hey mister, move your car.

665
00:49:12,506 --> 00:49:13,506
Yes?

666
00:49:13,507 --> 00:49:14,882
What yes?
Are you deaf?

667
00:49:14,906 --> 00:49:16,886
I said move your car,
I need to get my car out.

668
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:17,910
Nonsense.

669
00:49:17,963 --> 00:49:20,230
I don't know where they come from!

670
00:49:30,083 --> 00:49:32,645
Move your car, sir.
You aren't allowed to park here.

671
00:49:32,669 --> 00:49:33,964
We are waiting only for two minutes.

672
00:49:33,988 --> 00:49:34,988
Stop troubling us.

673
00:49:35,004 --> 00:49:36,853
You can stay the night here,
if you want. I don't care.

674
00:49:36,877 --> 00:49:38,214
Just park the car elsewhere.

675
00:49:38,238 --> 00:49:39,338
He's unnecessarily trouobling us.

676
00:49:39,346 --> 00:49:42,171
Just tell us where's Mehak madam.

677
00:49:42,251 --> 00:49:44,318
I don't know.
Stop troubling me.

678
00:49:44,451 --> 00:49:47,184
Please tell us.
Why are you getting angry?

679
00:49:47,343 --> 00:49:48,614
That's must better.

680
00:49:48,638 --> 00:49:50,107
You should show respect.

681
00:49:50,131 --> 00:49:52,515
If you had spoken politely earlier
then I'd introduce you to her by now.

682
00:49:52,539 --> 00:49:53,772
Why not now?

683
00:49:53,927 --> 00:49:55,062
How can I?

684
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:57,712
She just left right in front of you
after sharing those kind words with you.

685
00:49:57,736 --> 00:49:59,652
Oh no, the one with the car?

686
00:49:59,952 --> 00:50:01,685
Yes, the one with the car.

687
00:50:02,496 --> 00:50:05,386
You are making faces
like you've seen Laden.

688
00:50:05,613 --> 00:50:12,274
Just let us know which department does
she work in and what are her timing.

689
00:50:12,492 --> 00:50:15,092
Come in the morning. Stop troubling me.

690
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,530
- Deepa?
- Yes?

691
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:19,385
Meet us at AAA. We will have some fun.

692
00:50:26,243 --> 00:50:28,503
Come on.
What took you so long?

693
00:50:29,702 --> 00:50:30,991
Where have you been?

694
00:50:31,015 --> 00:50:33,748
Let's meet and talk.
Hold on for a second.

695
00:50:33,863 --> 00:50:35,628
Tell me, what will you drink?

696
00:50:35,652 --> 00:50:36,930
No, we won't drink.

697
00:50:36,954 --> 00:50:39,289
We have come home after a long time.
We need to go back home to mother.

698
00:50:39,313 --> 00:50:40,485
It doesn't seem right.

699
00:50:40,509 --> 00:50:42,870
Can we at least eat something?
I am starving.

700
00:50:42,894 --> 00:50:44,468
Order something to eat.

701
00:50:44,492 --> 00:50:47,113
I have someone waiting for me.
I will be back in 10 minutes.

702
00:50:47,137 --> 00:50:48,137
Please.

703
00:50:48,298 --> 00:50:49,738
Yes.
You are there?

704
00:50:50,084 --> 00:50:51,233
Yes, I am coming.

705
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:52,712
Do we tell Gabby
about our work in Delhi?

706
00:50:52,736 --> 00:50:53,736
No.

707
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:57,565
We don't know what he will
think about us if he finds out.

708
00:50:57,805 --> 00:50:58,805
Sorry, sir.

709
00:50:58,806 --> 00:51:00,259
This table is reserved.

710
00:51:00,283 --> 00:51:01,643
We'll pay for it.

711
00:51:02,217 --> 00:51:03,657
Not possible, sir.

712
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:05,745
Drop it. Why are you troubling us?

713
00:51:05,769 --> 00:51:07,449
Don't you understand?

714
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:30,070
My grandfather used to rule Jagravan.

715
00:51:30,394 --> 00:51:35,789
And my father rules the truck
union since the past 25 years.

716
00:51:36,292 --> 00:51:39,865
And now I, Jagga, rules this area.

717
00:51:40,342 --> 00:51:46,412
There is no one who doesn't know that this
seat is reserved for a special person.

718
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:50,860
And I am sure even an
outsider does learn about it.

719
00:51:51,221 --> 00:51:55,857
Be it an officer or a leader, the person
sitting on the seat keeps changing.

720
00:51:55,881 --> 00:52:00,397
Be it a bus or a plane,
passengers keep changing.

721
00:52:00,675 --> 00:52:04,591
Jagga's stamp is always on
the things that belong to Jagga.

722
00:52:04,785 --> 00:52:09,729
Forget sitting on it,
people don't think about it.

723
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:13,369
I hope you have understood.

724
00:52:13,789 --> 00:52:15,661
Why don't you make us understand?

725
00:52:15,685 --> 00:52:17,526
I thought so.

726
00:52:18,223 --> 00:52:20,890
That I will have to make you understand.

727
00:52:24,679 --> 00:52:27,466
I am not make sounds
like those small firecrackers.

728
00:52:27,490 --> 00:52:35,162
I like to soar into the
sky and cause an explosion.

729
00:52:49,977 --> 00:52:50,977
Oh no.

730
00:52:55,389 --> 00:52:57,069
I should get out of here.

731
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:09,170
The scoundrels ran away.

732
00:53:10,404 --> 00:53:13,530
They cannot escape
after disturbing a beehive.

733
00:53:14,265 --> 00:53:15,265
Come here.

734
00:53:16,665 --> 00:53:21,728
Who was they who dared to mess with me?

735
00:53:22,399 --> 00:53:24,532
I don't know. They are new here.

736
00:53:24,725 --> 00:53:27,058
I have never seen them here before.

737
00:53:28,053 --> 00:53:33,405
They will die the next
time I will see them.

738
00:53:40,796 --> 00:53:42,073
Are you still at the restaurant?

739
00:53:42,097 --> 00:53:43,694
- I'm coming there.
- Let it be.

740
00:53:43,718 --> 00:53:45,165
We got into a fight over there.

741
00:53:45,189 --> 00:53:46,922
Then meet me at the hills.

742
00:53:47,112 --> 00:53:49,646
If I hadn't switched off
the lights and got you out of there...

743
00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:53,214
...then we wouldn't have needed
an excuse to meet Mehak in the morning.

744
00:53:53,238 --> 00:53:57,334
They would've thrashed us enough
to get admitted in the hospital.

745
00:54:12,281 --> 00:54:14,055
They get together these days.

746
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:16,662
I didn't know Jagga would
come there and cause trouble.

747
00:54:16,686 --> 00:54:21,117
If we knew he was coming there then
we would have gone there on purpose.

748
00:54:21,141 --> 00:54:22,903
I understand how you feel.

749
00:54:23,771 --> 00:54:25,150
But he is in power.

750
00:54:25,174 --> 00:54:27,451
I would suggest that you
be patient and don't be angry.

751
00:54:27,475 --> 00:54:28,661
Did you go to meet Mehak?

752
00:54:28,685 --> 00:54:30,302
We did.

753
00:54:30,531 --> 00:54:33,671
I knew it.
That's why I called you.

754
00:54:33,946 --> 00:54:35,356
I thought I should
find out what happened.

755
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:37,805
She had gone off duty
by the time we went there.

756
00:54:37,829 --> 00:54:39,156
Speak up, man.

757
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,923
Do you want me to call her
up so that you can talk to her?

758
00:54:41,947 --> 00:54:43,849
I am sure that will
get you into a happy mood.

759
00:54:43,873 --> 00:54:46,160
No. It is not so.

760
00:54:46,369 --> 00:54:48,902
Let's go home. Mother must be waiting.

761
00:54:49,624 --> 00:54:51,624
Let's go, brother.
As you wish.

762
00:54:53,927 --> 00:54:56,594
We have come at the right time, Battery.

763
00:54:58,127 --> 00:54:59,567
You are back, son.

764
00:55:00,807 --> 00:55:04,199
Freshen up, boys.
There is some warm water in the jug.

765
00:55:04,619 --> 00:55:06,619
- Come here, Battery.
- Coming.

766
00:55:07,409 --> 00:55:09,089
Come and wash your hands.

767
00:55:13,174 --> 00:55:14,854
Serve us dinner, mother.

768
00:55:15,509 --> 00:55:18,427
Okay son, I'll serve it.
Sit on the cot, son.

769
00:55:18,507 --> 00:55:19,810
I'll serve you over there.

770
00:55:19,834 --> 00:55:21,029
No, mother.

771
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:23,701
We have got this opportunity
after a long time.

772
00:55:23,725 --> 00:55:26,625
We managed to survive
with great difficulty...

773
00:55:26,654 --> 00:55:28,216
...reminiscing our childhood days.

774
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,070
Fine, son.
You can eat over here.

775
00:55:30,094 --> 00:55:31,289
Take this.

776
00:55:33,255 --> 00:55:35,148
Am I dreaming?

777
00:55:35,228 --> 00:55:37,567
No, my naive mother. You aren't.

778
00:55:43,432 --> 00:55:44,432
Battery?

779
00:55:44,864 --> 00:55:45,864
Battery?

780
00:55:47,127 --> 00:55:48,167
Yes, brother?

781
00:55:48,598 --> 00:55:51,116
Mehak didn't recognise
me in the morning.

782
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:52,345
Yes, brother.

783
00:55:52,705 --> 00:55:54,705
She met you after a long time.

784
00:55:56,930 --> 00:55:59,397
Will she talk to me tomorrow morning?

785
00:55:59,851 --> 00:56:01,151
Yes, she will.

786
00:56:04,287 --> 00:56:05,287
Battery?

787
00:56:05,833 --> 00:56:06,833
Battery?

788
00:56:07,107 --> 00:56:08,147
Yes, brother?

789
00:56:08,686 --> 00:56:11,219
Will she scold me? Like she had today?

790
00:56:11,390 --> 00:56:12,825
No, brother.

791
00:56:15,189 --> 00:56:16,208
Battery?

792
00:56:16,955 --> 00:56:17,955
Battery!

793
00:56:18,261 --> 00:56:19,301
Yes, brother?

794
00:56:29,918 --> 00:56:34,948
"Should I fall for your blue eyes?"
"Or should I fall for sharp nose?"

795
00:56:35,638 --> 00:56:40,374
"Should I fall for your beautiful neck?"
"Or should I fall for slim waist?"

796
00:56:41,239 --> 00:56:44,580
"Should I fall for your blue eyes?
Or should I fall for sharp nose?"

797
00:56:44,604 --> 00:56:47,056
"Should I fall for your beautiful neck?
Or should I fall for slim waist?"

798
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:52,738
"It feels like we know each other since
past life when you look into my eyes."

799
00:56:55,524 --> 00:57:01,277
"I get a feeling of deja vu
when you embrace me."

800
00:57:01,746 --> 00:57:06,426
"A feeling of deja vu
when you embrace me."

801
00:57:12,798 --> 00:57:14,970
"Your eyes..."

802
00:57:15,261 --> 00:57:17,584
"Your eyes..."

803
00:57:17,723 --> 00:57:28,330
"I am high from the time I saw you."

804
00:57:29,406 --> 00:57:33,643
"You are a miracle,
that's why I am in love with you."

805
00:57:34,948 --> 00:57:39,254
"Flowers have shared
their hue with you."

806
00:57:40,661 --> 00:57:43,490
"You are a miracle,
that's why I am in love with you."

807
00:57:43,514 --> 00:57:47,847
"Flowers have shared
their hue with you."

808
00:57:49,185 --> 00:57:55,142
"I know that it's just not me,
you love me too."

809
00:57:56,023 --> 00:58:01,660
"I get a feeling of deja vu
when you embrace me."

810
00:58:02,423 --> 00:58:08,135
"A feeling of deja vu
when you embrace me."

811
00:58:13,498 --> 00:58:15,841
"Like a star..."

812
00:58:16,293 --> 00:58:18,259
"Like a star..."

813
00:58:18,339 --> 00:58:23,709
"I like your sparkling
nose ring more than the moon."

814
00:58:23,789 --> 00:58:29,591
"I like your sparkling
nose ring more than the moon."

815
00:58:30,047 --> 00:58:34,462
"There is different,
nothing compares to your beauty."

816
00:58:35,610 --> 00:58:39,920
"I know you think about me too."

817
00:58:41,311 --> 00:58:47,842
"There is different,
nothing compares to your beauty."

818
00:58:49,879 --> 00:58:55,433
"I feature in your dreams
and you feature in mine."

819
00:58:56,712 --> 00:59:02,731
"I get a feeling of deja vu
when you embrace me."

820
00:59:02,938 --> 00:59:08,447
"A feeling of deja vu
when you embrace me."

821
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:16,538
"It's true..."

822
00:59:17,023 --> 00:59:19,106
"It's true..."

823
00:59:19,186 --> 00:59:24,653
"You love me... and I love you."

824
00:59:24,733 --> 00:59:30,352
"You love me,
and my beloved, I love you."

825
00:59:35,386 --> 00:59:37,694
This land is at a prime location.

826
00:59:37,774 --> 00:59:39,193
Right on the road.

827
00:59:39,217 --> 00:59:40,940
We have won it at an auction.

828
00:59:40,964 --> 00:59:44,794
Other parties used to increase the
rates whenever we tried to make a deal.

829
00:59:44,818 --> 00:59:47,440
The showroom is right at road.

830
00:59:47,621 --> 00:59:49,821
All of them are commercial plots.

831
00:59:50,009 --> 00:59:51,953
You should talk to the MLA.

832
00:59:52,258 --> 00:59:55,007
People will buy the plots in no time.

833
01:00:03,904 --> 01:00:06,848
Consider that I have
already spoken to the MLA.

834
01:00:07,607 --> 01:00:10,871
It is my responsibility
to get the work done by him.

835
01:00:11,543 --> 01:00:13,407
But what will I get?

836
01:00:13,703 --> 01:00:15,383
We cannot escape you.

837
01:00:15,425 --> 01:00:16,812
We will do as you say.

838
01:00:16,836 --> 01:00:19,844
You can take whatever
percentage you usually do.

839
01:00:21,944 --> 01:00:24,134
How much percentage are you assuming?

840
01:00:24,158 --> 01:00:26,256
We have already kept
a million aside for you.

841
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:29,118
A plot and a showroom for the MLA.

842
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:34,228
Give these meagre
percentages to brokers.

843
01:00:35,122 --> 01:00:37,815
I am not a broker, I do partnerships.

844
01:00:38,745 --> 01:00:39,954
50 percentage.

845
01:00:41,752 --> 01:00:44,276
Let me know if you are okay with it.

846
01:00:44,503 --> 01:00:46,695
Otherwise, you may leave.

847
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:48,490
That's too much.

848
01:00:49,396 --> 01:00:51,227
But it's okay.

849
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:53,329
Let us think over it and let you know.

850
01:00:53,353 --> 01:00:56,891
The more time you take to think
the more interest you'll have to pay.

851
01:00:56,915 --> 01:01:00,650
So the less you think
the better it will be you.

852
01:01:01,419 --> 01:01:06,860
If so much payment is blocked then
your hearts will get blocked as well.

853
01:01:16,258 --> 01:01:17,258
Deepa?

854
01:01:18,111 --> 01:01:19,573
Be respectful.

855
01:01:19,827 --> 01:01:21,960
Otherwise, things will go south.

856
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:27,205
Remember us? We were here yesterday.

857
01:01:27,229 --> 01:01:29,456
Why do I need to? Are you my cousins?

858
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:32,037
I see so many people every day.
Tell me what work you have.

859
01:01:32,061 --> 01:01:34,311
We wanted to meet Mehak madam.

860
01:01:34,578 --> 01:01:35,578
Who Mehak?

861
01:01:35,853 --> 01:01:38,520
This is the first time I heard her name.

862
01:01:41,403 --> 01:01:43,283
Okay, Mehak madam.

863
01:01:43,363 --> 01:01:46,199
She is in Dr. SP Sachdeva's room.

864
01:01:46,279 --> 01:01:48,612
Go inside, first room on the right.

865
01:01:50,009 --> 01:01:52,130
I made 100 bucks!

866
01:01:58,526 --> 01:02:00,038
Yes? How can I help?

867
01:02:00,062 --> 01:02:01,437
I wanted to meet the doctor.

868
01:02:01,461 --> 01:02:03,141
Okay.
What's the problem?

869
01:02:03,237 --> 01:02:05,891
I don't feel hungry anymore
after I eat something.

870
01:02:05,915 --> 01:02:08,582
And he cannot see
after he goes to sleep.

871
01:02:10,608 --> 01:02:13,379
You don't need medicines.
You need thrashing.

872
01:02:13,403 --> 01:02:14,403
What?

873
01:02:14,404 --> 01:02:15,404
Yes.

874
01:02:15,405 --> 01:02:17,959
We also have a doctor
to treats mad people.

875
01:02:17,983 --> 01:02:18,983
Let me go call him.

876
01:02:18,984 --> 01:02:20,539
No Mehak, you are mistaken.

877
01:02:20,563 --> 01:02:21,902
Wait, I'll call the security.

878
01:02:21,926 --> 01:02:23,092
- Mehak!
- Security!

879
01:02:23,116 --> 01:02:24,116
Listen to me!

880
01:02:24,117 --> 01:02:25,543
- I am Jogga.
- I am Deepa.

881
01:02:25,567 --> 01:02:26,567
Battery!

882
01:02:26,568 --> 01:02:29,284
You should get lost,
no matter what your name is.

883
01:02:29,308 --> 01:02:32,018
Be it Battery Torch, Jogga Moga.

884
01:02:32,098 --> 01:02:35,042
I don't care what your name is,
just get out...

885
01:02:40,217 --> 01:02:41,217
Jogga?

886
01:02:43,232 --> 01:02:44,232
Deepa?

887
01:02:46,947 --> 01:02:47,947
Battery?

888
01:02:49,882 --> 01:02:51,030
The trios?

889
01:02:51,563 --> 01:02:53,243
I don't believe this.

890
01:02:54,419 --> 01:02:56,451
Back after all these years?

891
01:02:56,531 --> 01:02:58,448
Actually, we had gone out for work.

892
01:02:58,472 --> 01:02:59,511
Oh.

893
01:03:01,395 --> 01:03:04,507
I think you should leave right away.
Doctor will be here any moment now.

894
01:03:04,531 --> 01:03:06,051
We will meet later.

895
01:03:06,169 --> 01:03:07,849
- Okay, bye.
- Okay, bye.

896
01:03:10,815 --> 01:03:12,015
What is it now?

897
01:03:12,158 --> 01:03:15,634
This is our number.
Call when you are free.

898
01:03:18,258 --> 01:03:19,438
Stupid boys.

899
01:03:19,518 --> 01:03:21,176
Who knows whether she
will take the number or not.

900
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,880
He'll try to give it.

901
01:03:25,509 --> 01:03:27,576
What did she say?
Will she call?

902
01:03:27,713 --> 01:03:29,646
She said why should she call?

903
01:03:31,769 --> 01:03:33,129
Look at his face.

904
01:03:34,453 --> 01:03:37,353
She will call.
She will call in the afternoon.

905
01:03:39,292 --> 01:03:41,761
Brother, my son's critically ill.

906
01:03:41,999 --> 01:03:43,715
We need o positive blood.

907
01:03:43,909 --> 01:03:45,909
If any of you could donate it?

908
01:03:46,458 --> 01:03:48,398
Don't worry, we will get ours checked.

909
01:03:48,422 --> 01:03:49,422
Okay.

910
01:03:56,665 --> 01:03:58,580
Thank you, brother.

911
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:00,835
Sit here,
I'll get milk and bananas for you.

912
01:04:00,859 --> 01:04:02,992
No brother, it's okay.
Thank you.

913
01:04:06,523 --> 01:04:08,685
Brother, Mehak still hasn't called.

914
01:04:08,709 --> 01:04:10,398
It's 2 o'clock.

915
01:04:10,555 --> 01:04:14,587
You should've said that sooner
and she would have called sooner.

916
01:04:14,923 --> 01:04:15,923
Hello?

917
01:04:21,022 --> 01:04:22,092
Okay.

918
01:04:23,870 --> 01:04:25,323
What is she saying?

919
01:04:25,347 --> 01:04:27,140
It was Baiji from Delhi.

920
01:04:27,618 --> 01:04:29,000
He said everything is settled.

921
01:04:29,024 --> 01:04:30,609
We should come back.

922
01:04:30,633 --> 01:04:31,742
We will have to go back one day.

923
01:04:31,766 --> 01:04:34,305
Why didn't tell him that
we will come back in a few days.

924
01:04:34,329 --> 01:04:35,449
Call him back.

925
01:04:37,524 --> 01:04:39,257
I think it's Baiji, again.

926
01:04:40,769 --> 01:04:41,769
Hello?

927
01:04:42,773 --> 01:04:43,773
Okay.

928
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:46,776
What did Baiji say?

929
01:04:47,325 --> 01:04:49,280
It was Mehak and not Baiji.

930
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:50,360
Oh.

931
01:04:50,683 --> 01:04:53,350
She wants us to meet her in the canteen.

932
01:04:57,295 --> 01:04:59,168
You boys seem to be very happy.

933
01:04:59,192 --> 01:05:00,765
What happened? Did you have a son?

934
01:05:00,789 --> 01:05:03,797
Not a son.
But we found the son's father's wife.

935
01:05:04,474 --> 01:05:08,200
They are either high or crazy.

936
01:05:09,532 --> 01:05:12,015
Hey trios, welcome.

937
01:05:12,095 --> 01:05:13,240
How are all of you?

938
01:05:13,264 --> 01:05:14,392
- Good.
- Good.

939
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:15,710
Good.

940
01:05:15,941 --> 01:05:18,274
Uncle, four cups of coffee, please.

941
01:05:18,739 --> 01:05:21,606
No, three cups of tea
and one cup of coffee.

942
01:05:21,670 --> 01:05:22,670
Okay.

943
01:05:22,906 --> 01:05:24,586
Then I too will have tea.

944
01:05:24,637 --> 01:05:26,865
Uncle, four cups of tea please.

945
01:05:27,206 --> 01:05:30,008
I must say, you guys are great actors.

946
01:05:31,049 --> 01:05:33,103
I didn't realise it.

947
01:05:33,464 --> 01:05:38,264
If you had taken some more time to
realise then we would have been thrashed.

948
01:05:39,476 --> 01:05:41,199
Yes, that is true.

949
01:05:42,110 --> 01:05:44,328
So, what's going on these days?

950
01:05:44,665 --> 01:05:46,166
Import-export.

951
01:05:46,538 --> 01:05:47,538
Wow.

952
01:05:47,561 --> 01:05:49,717
Import-export.
What goods?

953
01:05:53,005 --> 01:05:54,005
Sandwich.

954
01:05:54,206 --> 01:05:55,206
Sandwich?

955
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:58,490
Yes, I mean would anyone
like to eat sandwiches?

956
01:05:58,514 --> 01:06:01,091
Oh. No. Actually, not for now.

957
01:06:01,952 --> 01:06:04,518
I am late. I needed to go to the market.

958
01:06:04,542 --> 01:06:06,180
See you guys later?

959
01:06:07,929 --> 01:06:08,929
Bye.

960
01:06:10,065 --> 01:06:13,925
Mehak's nature hasn't changed at all.
She is just as bubbly as she was.

961
01:06:13,949 --> 01:06:17,491
Nature doesn't change,
it just develops as you age.

962
01:06:17,946 --> 01:06:19,999
Brother, didn't you
have to call Karaj bhai?

963
01:06:20,023 --> 01:06:21,023
Oh yes.

964
01:06:23,406 --> 01:06:25,192
We three discussed this.

965
01:06:25,427 --> 01:06:27,329
Can we spend a few more days here?

966
01:06:27,353 --> 01:06:29,260
You don't need to ask, Jogga.

967
01:06:29,284 --> 01:06:30,646
Okay, Baiji. Bye.

968
01:06:37,565 --> 01:06:39,468
We have come back to
our city after a long time.

969
01:06:39,492 --> 01:06:40,831
I am liking it over here.

970
01:06:40,855 --> 01:06:42,159
We are all lliking it here.

971
01:06:42,183 --> 01:06:45,381
But the most important
thing to do is get Jagga.

972
01:06:45,610 --> 01:06:47,305
Let's ask Gabby where can we find him.

973
01:06:47,329 --> 01:06:49,757
Call him up.
We need to get him.

974
01:07:06,693 --> 01:07:08,626
Who knows when will he leave.

975
01:07:10,033 --> 01:07:14,841
Time doesn't matter when
a hunter waits for a prey.

976
01:07:15,252 --> 01:07:20,333
You should opt for guerrilla warfare
then the enemy forces are strong.

977
01:07:24,548 --> 01:07:25,726
They are here.

978
01:07:27,307 --> 01:07:29,307
His mother won't be
expecting him home today.

979
01:07:29,331 --> 01:07:32,740
He has ruined our lives.
Hurry up.

980
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:10,217
The railway crossing had to stop now?

981
01:08:10,904 --> 01:08:12,246
He got away.

982
01:08:31,887 --> 01:08:33,897
Jogga, go inside and sit.

983
01:08:34,277 --> 01:08:36,122
I'll go and get something to eat.

984
01:08:36,146 --> 01:08:38,276
Battery, you come with me.

985
01:09:12,408 --> 01:09:16,071
Why are you guys
running like wild bulls?

986
01:09:16,353 --> 01:09:17,852
Who do you plan to crush?

987
01:09:17,876 --> 01:09:21,823
No, we just came to call Battery to let
him know that the show is about to begin.

988
01:09:21,847 --> 01:09:22,939
But what are you doing here?

989
01:09:22,963 --> 01:09:25,100
I invited her, by calling her up.

990
01:09:25,124 --> 01:09:26,124
Oh I see.

991
01:09:27,798 --> 01:09:30,998
Look at this,
our entire childhood is together now.

992
01:09:31,123 --> 01:09:32,923
We, the five great experts!

993
01:09:34,978 --> 01:09:35,978
Let's go.

994
01:09:36,581 --> 01:09:38,247
Don't you want to go
inside and watch the movie?

995
01:09:38,271 --> 01:09:39,475
The show is about to start.

996
01:09:39,499 --> 01:09:40,499
Hurry up.

997
01:09:45,473 --> 01:09:55,450
'A person's soul slowly dying every day
is more painful than the physical death.'

998
01:09:57,613 --> 01:10:02,741
'I will fill Jagga's
life with such a poison that...'

999
01:10:03,156 --> 01:10:07,716
'...Jagga will find death
better than the hellish life.'

1000
01:10:08,385 --> 01:10:11,783
Brother, Jagga is in a
much better position than us.

1001
01:10:12,324 --> 01:10:15,773
He has more men and more money as well.

1002
01:10:16,079 --> 01:10:19,026
Just because he has
hills and the MLA's support.

1003
01:10:19,050 --> 01:10:20,090
He is better!

1004
01:10:22,012 --> 01:10:23,879
Then let's attack the hills.

1005
01:10:24,301 --> 01:10:26,860
And take off the MLA's support.

1006
01:10:28,717 --> 01:10:31,360
"Even a chicken looks like a pigeon."

1007
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:32,755
"Even a chicken..."

1008
01:10:32,779 --> 01:10:36,640
"The enemies are coming closer,
my dear..."

1009
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:38,809
"My dear..."

1010
01:10:38,889 --> 01:10:41,779
"It is time to look carefully."

1011
01:10:41,859 --> 01:10:43,219
"Look carefully."

1012
01:10:43,254 --> 01:10:45,020
"Look carefully."

1013
01:10:45,839 --> 01:10:47,892
"Look carefully."

1014
01:10:52,758 --> 01:10:54,447
This is good stuff.

1015
01:10:54,836 --> 01:10:56,903
I never had this kind of stuff.

1016
01:10:57,299 --> 01:10:58,819
What about our job?

1017
01:10:59,064 --> 01:11:01,719
Consider your job done.

1018
01:11:04,237 --> 01:11:07,528
MLA sir, we get very less water.

1019
01:11:07,608 --> 01:11:11,635
By the time water reaches our fields,
our turn is over.

1020
01:11:13,304 --> 01:11:15,841
The boy who distributes
pensions in our area...

1021
01:11:15,865 --> 01:11:19,806
...says that he would give us our
pension only if we give him half of it.

1022
01:11:19,830 --> 01:11:20,963
- Note it down.
- Yes, sir.

1023
01:11:20,987 --> 01:11:25,503
MLA sir, the opposition's
has charged my son with eve teasing.

1024
01:11:25,583 --> 01:11:28,504
Gajjan Singh, ask your son to apologise.

1025
01:11:28,675 --> 01:11:30,504
You know the elections
are just around the corner.

1026
01:11:30,528 --> 01:11:33,108
Sometimes,
such issues cause big trouble to us.

1027
01:11:33,132 --> 01:11:37,032
Media hunts for such news
like a hungry dog huts for food.

1028
01:11:37,112 --> 01:11:39,025
Note it down. We will do something.

1029
01:11:39,049 --> 01:11:40,106
Done, sir.

1030
01:11:42,934 --> 01:11:45,361
Enjoy your tea and snacks.
I'll see you guys later.

1031
01:11:45,385 --> 01:11:47,870
Let me know if any of
you have any issues pending.

1032
01:11:47,894 --> 01:11:48,956
Bye.

1033
01:11:52,378 --> 01:11:54,386
Dad, he is my friend Jogga.

1034
01:11:54,466 --> 01:11:56,146
- Hello.
- Have a seat.

1035
01:11:57,678 --> 01:11:59,008
Yes, son. Tell me.

1036
01:11:59,032 --> 01:12:01,557
I wanted to give some
funds for your party.

1037
01:12:01,581 --> 01:12:02,581
How much?

1038
01:12:04,331 --> 01:12:05,363
2000?

1039
01:12:05,602 --> 01:12:07,597
20 million.
Cash.

1040
01:12:08,758 --> 01:12:09,945
20 million?

1041
01:12:11,609 --> 01:12:13,330
What do you want in exchange?

1042
01:12:13,354 --> 01:12:15,528
Youth president-ship.

1043
01:12:15,673 --> 01:12:18,976
We already have a president.
He is working well for the party.

1044
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,301
No problem,
I'll talk to some other party.

1045
01:12:22,555 --> 01:12:25,228
Victory and loss matter to you, MLA sir.

1046
01:12:25,615 --> 01:12:29,002
I just need a plank outside the door.

1047
01:12:29,269 --> 01:12:30,283
A licence.

1048
01:12:30,482 --> 01:12:32,749
You are quite mature for your age.

1049
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:34,107
What work do you do?

1050
01:12:34,131 --> 01:12:35,131
Smuggling.

1051
01:12:35,614 --> 01:12:38,147
What if I get you arrested right away?

1052
01:12:39,344 --> 01:12:42,104
I have enough information
about you, sir.

1053
01:12:42,689 --> 01:12:44,369
I know you won't do that.

1054
01:12:44,686 --> 01:12:48,720
That too when you are being
offered a profitable deal.

1055
01:12:48,897 --> 01:12:51,374
You won't get the president's
post just by throwing money around.

1056
01:12:51,398 --> 01:12:54,917
You need to get youth with you.
It's a struggle.

1057
01:12:55,162 --> 01:12:57,742
Give me a chance, sir.

1058
01:12:57,973 --> 01:12:59,846
Confidence is a good thing.

1059
01:13:00,147 --> 01:13:03,592
But overconfidence can ruin you.

1060
01:13:03,804 --> 01:13:07,072
You will know the results
before the elections.

1061
01:13:07,289 --> 01:13:09,454
Fine, let's see.

1062
01:13:17,898 --> 01:13:19,254
Hello, Baiji.

1063
01:13:20,254 --> 01:13:22,472
Baiji, I need stuff in Punjab.

1064
01:13:22,809 --> 01:13:25,251
I have got hold of a very big game.

1065
01:13:29,897 --> 01:13:32,063
Someone make the phone call.

1066
01:13:32,143 --> 01:13:33,894
Get the drugs.

1067
01:13:33,974 --> 01:13:36,584
My bones are aching.
I feel like dying.

1068
01:13:36,664 --> 01:13:39,236
It is difficult to get any these days.

1069
01:13:39,316 --> 01:13:43,241
And those who have it
are selling it at 5000 a kilo.

1070
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:48,333
It is filled with sand,
sawdust and crushed pills.

1071
01:13:49,233 --> 01:13:50,620
Here's a card for you.

1072
01:13:50,644 --> 01:13:53,012
Damn the government.

1073
01:13:53,391 --> 01:13:55,279
They have stopped drugs.

1074
01:13:55,562 --> 01:13:58,482
All the druggies are as good as dead.

1075
01:13:59,224 --> 01:14:00,904
It was getting dirty.

1076
01:14:01,167 --> 01:14:03,809
There was hardly anyone
left who hadn't tasted it.

1077
01:14:03,833 --> 01:14:09,427
We used to have two spoons full
in the morning and work like a machine.

1078
01:14:09,507 --> 01:14:12,689
Now the body doesn't
function without it.

1079
01:14:12,769 --> 01:14:17,341
I tried the pills,
they don't work at all.

1080
01:14:17,829 --> 01:14:20,032
I am getting cramps.

1081
01:14:20,112 --> 01:14:23,531
I am having a tough time
since morning cleaning my rare.

1082
01:14:23,555 --> 01:14:25,899
Original stuff is not available.

1083
01:14:26,110 --> 01:14:28,651
I am sure it is diluted stuff.

1084
01:15:11,539 --> 01:15:14,384
Rob someone.
Find a solution.

1085
01:15:15,727 --> 01:15:17,927
- Did you find something?
- I cannot wait any longer.

1086
01:15:17,951 --> 01:15:20,104
A very potent stuff
has come in the market.

1087
01:15:20,128 --> 01:15:23,410
A small pouch is enough
to keep you high all day.

1088
01:15:23,846 --> 01:15:26,501
What's so special about it?

1089
01:15:26,653 --> 01:15:29,348
Heroin.
It is expensive.

1090
01:15:29,902 --> 01:15:31,422
A took two pouches.

1091
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:35,220
We will sell it and keep
some back to enjoy it for free.

1092
01:15:39,770 --> 01:15:40,849
Get them.

1093
01:15:40,929 --> 01:15:43,596
I'll shoot the ones who try to run away.

1094
01:15:48,073 --> 01:15:49,661
Throw them all into the jeep.

1095
01:15:49,685 --> 01:15:51,429
And seize their brewery.

1096
01:15:51,771 --> 01:15:55,295
What's the use of keeping
the things in the car, inspector?

1097
01:15:55,319 --> 01:15:59,991
You'll have to keep everything back
where it was when Jagga will call you.

1098
01:16:02,447 --> 01:16:04,794
I don't talk to anyone over the phone.

1099
01:16:04,818 --> 01:16:06,767
Whoever wants to talk to
me can come to my police station.

1100
01:16:06,791 --> 01:16:08,456
Come with me, I'll teach you a lesson.

1101
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:11,280
Take them along.
Let's teach them a lesson.

1102
01:16:14,665 --> 01:16:18,313
Every party is trying hard
these days to win the election.

1103
01:16:18,433 --> 01:16:20,366
Election! Election! Election!

1104
01:16:20,674 --> 01:16:25,854
The greed for the power and position
don't let you rest in peace, father.

1105
01:16:26,817 --> 01:16:29,726
Jagga Bhai, police raided our breweries.

1106
01:16:29,886 --> 01:16:31,780
Our trucks filled with
poppy seeds also got caught.

1107
01:16:31,804 --> 01:16:33,410
Talk to the MLA.

1108
01:16:33,490 --> 01:16:36,448
MLA doesn't meet me.

1109
01:16:36,792 --> 01:16:39,736
And he seems to have
blocked my number as well.

1110
01:16:39,917 --> 01:16:42,769
Our party is working against drugs.

1111
01:16:42,978 --> 01:16:45,511
We are concerned about our youth.

1112
01:16:45,591 --> 01:16:51,508
In near future we will
eradicate drugs from the society.

1113
01:16:51,713 --> 01:16:53,900
I assure you of that.

1114
01:16:58,608 --> 01:16:59,608
Hello?

1115
01:16:59,609 --> 01:17:00,799
Jagga here.

1116
01:17:01,854 --> 01:17:02,854
President.

1117
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:05,953
I want to talk to the MLA.

1118
01:17:06,274 --> 01:17:08,617
I'll ask him to. He's giving
an interview to a TV channel.

1119
01:17:08,641 --> 01:17:09,641
Hold on.

1120
01:17:10,329 --> 01:17:11,824
Sir, Jagga the president has called.

1121
01:17:11,848 --> 01:17:12,930
He is on hold.

1122
01:17:12,954 --> 01:17:14,053
Which president?

1123
01:17:14,077 --> 01:17:15,431
There are 20 such presidents here.

1124
01:17:15,455 --> 01:17:17,722
Don't answer just anybody's calls.

1125
01:17:23,139 --> 01:17:27,946
Father, seems like someone
is playing a big game against me.

1126
01:17:28,538 --> 01:17:32,073
According to the circumstances, instead
of making someone your weakness...

1127
01:17:32,097 --> 01:17:33,822
...you should become someone's weakness.

1128
01:17:33,846 --> 01:17:36,498
Jagga, do you know
why was your grandfather...

1129
01:17:36,522 --> 01:17:38,264
...addressed as Kharak Singh Jagravan?

1130
01:17:38,288 --> 01:17:43,897
Because he came from
Jagravan and ruled this city.

1131
01:17:44,351 --> 01:17:48,270
In order to take that name forward...

1132
01:17:48,350 --> 01:17:51,114
...I didn't let anyone rise
against me in the truck union.

1133
01:17:51,138 --> 01:17:55,061
When you will start
taking your own decisions...

1134
01:17:55,141 --> 01:17:58,853
...then people will start
addressing you as Jagga Jagravan.

1135
01:18:12,710 --> 01:18:13,710
Why are you working?

1136
01:18:13,730 --> 01:18:15,838
How dare you stop working?

1137
01:18:16,436 --> 01:18:18,369
How dare you come here!

1138
01:18:19,510 --> 01:18:21,886
You remember how I made you leave?

1139
01:18:22,074 --> 01:18:25,806
Jagga bhai, every dog has his day.

1140
01:18:25,886 --> 01:18:27,412
Times have turned.

1141
01:18:27,621 --> 01:18:31,285
Someone else has taken
over these hills now.

1142
01:18:31,365 --> 01:18:36,688
Who doesn't like his life
that he dared to mess with me?

1143
01:18:58,649 --> 01:19:00,974
Power gives you a strange high.

1144
01:19:01,295 --> 01:19:05,425
Your feel crushed
when you come out of it.

1145
01:19:05,623 --> 01:19:06,879
Did you recognise me?

1146
01:19:06,903 --> 01:19:08,223
Very well.

1147
01:19:09,282 --> 01:19:12,290
I need to settle the
fight in the hotel as well.

1148
01:19:12,582 --> 01:19:16,038
The day you guys ran with
your tails between your legs.

1149
01:19:18,143 --> 01:19:20,811
We need to settle something
that happened way back.

1150
01:19:20,835 --> 01:19:21,871
I am Deepa.

1151
01:19:23,677 --> 01:19:24,797
Jogga.

1152
01:19:25,390 --> 01:19:26,390
Battery.

1153
01:19:26,736 --> 01:19:27,736
Remember us?

1154
01:19:28,762 --> 01:19:30,345
Yes, I remember.

1155
01:19:30,810 --> 01:19:37,433
Three tiny hungry puppies
messing with Jagga, a lion?

1156
01:19:37,655 --> 01:19:40,485
You love to stay together, don't you?

1157
01:19:40,968 --> 01:19:43,957
I'll bury all three of you right here.

1158
01:19:44,143 --> 01:19:48,685
Don't you dare do
anything stupid, Jagga.

1159
01:19:50,391 --> 01:19:52,141
Well done, inspector.

1160
01:19:52,407 --> 01:19:56,892
You take bribes from
me and protect my enemies?

1161
01:19:57,493 --> 01:19:59,303
It is how the world works.

1162
01:19:59,768 --> 01:20:03,142
Everyone respects the rising
sun and not the sun that sets.

1163
01:20:03,166 --> 01:20:04,589
Let's go to the police station.

1164
01:20:04,613 --> 01:20:05,908
For what?

1165
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:12,674
When your time is bad,
you are not safe anywhere.

1166
01:20:20,703 --> 01:20:22,447
That settles our account.

1167
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:28,085
Puppies climb up a branch and assume
that they are no longer in danger.

1168
01:20:28,109 --> 01:20:34,871
Boys, whenever you get down,
the lion will be waiting for you.

1169
01:20:35,622 --> 01:20:38,353
And the account isn't settled as yet.

1170
01:20:38,826 --> 01:20:41,021
This story has just begun.

1171
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:44,253
Actually,
my actions mimic that of dengue.

1172
01:20:44,362 --> 01:20:51,642
I always give people a
second chance to make amends.

1173
01:20:52,126 --> 01:20:58,244
Otherwise,
your cells go down and you go... up.

1174
01:21:00,167 --> 01:21:01,855
Arrest him.

1175
01:21:24,212 --> 01:21:25,212
Oh I see.

1176
01:21:25,475 --> 01:21:29,820
Now I know who is holding
the remote of this game.

1177
01:21:30,203 --> 01:21:33,452
You should always
bet on the winning horse...

1178
01:21:33,532 --> 01:21:35,732
...and not the lame horse, Jagga.

1179
01:21:59,874 --> 01:22:02,465
What you did with Jagga was bad.

1180
01:22:02,642 --> 01:22:04,637
You got him stuck in a legal case.

1181
01:22:04,661 --> 01:22:06,080
Why did you do this?

1182
01:22:06,104 --> 01:22:08,758
So that he cannot join another party.

1183
01:22:09,145 --> 01:22:11,849
You would have got a huge blow,
MLA sir...

1184
01:22:11,873 --> 01:22:16,203
...if your party's youth
president joined another party.

1185
01:22:16,283 --> 01:22:18,950
Media would have exaggerated the matter.

1186
01:22:19,205 --> 01:22:22,480
No one would have said that
we kicked him out of the party.

1187
01:22:22,504 --> 01:22:24,306
Elections are just around the corner.

1188
01:22:24,330 --> 01:22:27,614
Jagga had meetings
with other parties, dad.

1189
01:22:27,694 --> 01:22:31,540
But they had a surveillance
on him and we were lucky.

1190
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:33,121
And he was unlucky.

1191
01:22:33,145 --> 01:22:36,222
And your other formula
worked as well, boys.

1192
01:22:36,349 --> 01:22:40,119
Dad, there are no other
drugs available in the market.

1193
01:22:40,423 --> 01:22:42,890
Ask the officers to be more strict...

1194
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:46,114
...so that no other
drug enters the market.

1195
01:22:46,451 --> 01:22:49,213
There should be only heroin everywhere.

1196
01:22:49,429 --> 01:22:53,021
We need alcohol and poppy
seeds during elections.

1197
01:22:53,176 --> 01:22:56,105
Youth vote the most, MLA sir.

1198
01:22:56,465 --> 01:22:59,989
And till the elections don't get over,
youth will want only one thing.

1199
01:23:00,013 --> 01:23:01,120
Heroin.

1200
01:23:01,558 --> 01:23:06,595
I'll fix your meeting with all the
colleges, ITI, village club presidents.

1201
01:23:06,806 --> 01:23:08,610
Distribute your goods everywhere.

1202
01:23:08,634 --> 01:23:11,164
Even if you have to distribute
it for free the first time.

1203
01:23:11,188 --> 01:23:15,609
People will follow us
like flies follow sweets.

1204
01:23:15,689 --> 01:23:18,991
What's the target expected
to cross in a month's time?

1205
01:23:19,015 --> 01:23:21,541
The quantity of stuff
we have received dad...

1206
01:23:21,565 --> 01:23:23,482
...if it gets distributed
all across the area...

1207
01:23:23,506 --> 01:23:26,617
...then it will take care of
all the expenses of the elections.

1208
01:23:26,641 --> 01:23:29,234
Don't lose focus because
of overexcitement.

1209
01:23:29,258 --> 01:23:32,131
Be careful not to
fall flat on your face.

1210
01:23:33,988 --> 01:23:36,055
Mehak isn't answering my calls.

1211
01:23:36,503 --> 01:23:39,103
Message her that we are in the canteen.

1212
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:41,200
You are right.

1213
01:23:43,743 --> 01:23:45,183
Is it good, Deepa?

1214
01:23:45,367 --> 01:23:47,538
First propose to her.

1215
01:23:49,519 --> 01:23:51,078
Hello!
Hi, everyone.

1216
01:23:51,482 --> 01:23:53,628
How's everything, trios?
All good?

1217
01:23:53,652 --> 01:23:56,112
It was a very busy day today.

1218
01:23:56,278 --> 01:23:59,361
Mehak, Jogga wants to discuss
something important with you.

1219
01:23:59,385 --> 01:24:01,151
Oh really? What do you want to say?

1220
01:24:01,175 --> 01:24:03,708
That's why you kept calling me, right?

1221
01:24:03,942 --> 01:24:07,142
You know I was on duty
at the emergency ward today.

1222
01:24:07,551 --> 01:24:10,200
School students came in,
they were so small.

1223
01:24:10,224 --> 01:24:12,080
Drugs overdose.

1224
01:24:13,055 --> 01:24:15,033
Two died on the spot.

1225
01:24:15,290 --> 01:24:17,757
And the other two are still critical.

1226
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:21,836
These synthetic drugs
are very dangerous.

1227
01:24:21,916 --> 01:24:24,971
All those who deal
in drugs should be hanged.

1228
01:24:25,413 --> 01:24:28,883
I'll kill the person responsible for it.

1229
01:24:29,990 --> 01:24:30,990
Are you okay?

1230
01:24:30,991 --> 01:24:31,991
I am fine.

1231
01:24:31,992 --> 01:24:32,992
Forget that.

1232
01:24:32,997 --> 01:24:35,612
Didn't you have something
important to discuss?

1233
01:24:35,636 --> 01:24:36,641
No, it's nothing.

1234
01:24:36,665 --> 01:24:38,748
What's wrong with you?
Why are you sweating so much?

1235
01:24:38,772 --> 01:24:39,793
Are you okay?

1236
01:24:39,817 --> 01:24:42,813
Yes. No, it's nothing.
I feel unwell, that's why.

1237
01:24:42,837 --> 01:24:44,413
Come on, let's get you checked up.

1238
01:24:44,437 --> 01:24:46,335
No, I am fine.
We'll get going now.

1239
01:24:46,359 --> 01:24:47,468
We'll meet when we are free.

1240
01:24:47,492 --> 01:24:49,967
Hey, hey, hey.
What happened?

1241
01:24:52,004 --> 01:24:53,321
It's Karaj bhai.

1242
01:24:55,518 --> 01:24:57,038
Hello?
Hello, Baiji.

1243
01:24:57,303 --> 01:24:58,401
Hello, boys.

1244
01:24:58,481 --> 01:24:59,795
Congratulations to you.

1245
01:24:59,819 --> 01:25:01,728
Jogga has become the youth president.

1246
01:25:01,752 --> 01:25:03,197
That's great news.

1247
01:25:03,385 --> 01:25:04,705
That's why you don't talk to me.

1248
01:25:04,729 --> 01:25:06,713
You fear that you might
have to give me a party.

1249
01:25:06,737 --> 01:25:08,034
You should come over, Baiji.

1250
01:25:08,058 --> 01:25:09,624
We will give you a
party you'll never forget.

1251
01:25:09,648 --> 01:25:11,033
Fine, I'll come to Punjab then.

1252
01:25:11,057 --> 01:25:13,579
I'll get to meet the
youth president as well.

1253
01:25:13,603 --> 01:25:15,348
Did you get the payment for our stuff?

1254
01:25:15,372 --> 01:25:16,682
Yes, Baiji.

1255
01:25:17,483 --> 01:25:18,719
Okay then.

1256
01:25:28,058 --> 01:25:32,339
Lord Almighty, like my son came back...

1257
01:25:32,419 --> 01:25:35,188
...I pray that my husband
too should return.

1258
01:25:35,212 --> 01:25:37,612
You never leave anyone disappointed.

1259
01:25:41,223 --> 01:25:43,908
Be generous, my Lord.

1260
01:25:57,956 --> 01:25:59,481
Why are you so worried, brother?

1261
01:25:59,505 --> 01:26:02,172
Mehak doesn't know that we do this work.

1262
01:26:02,811 --> 01:26:04,127
You are back, son.

1263
01:26:04,151 --> 01:26:06,829
Go inside and seek blessings.

1264
01:26:31,029 --> 01:26:32,627
Here son, have some water.

1265
01:26:32,651 --> 01:26:35,184
Mother, you keep working all day long.

1266
01:26:35,610 --> 01:26:37,731
Why don't you sit for some time?

1267
01:26:37,755 --> 01:26:40,007
- Don't you get tired?
- It's okay, son.

1268
01:26:40,031 --> 01:26:41,716
- Are you alright, son?
- Yes.

1269
01:26:41,740 --> 01:26:44,060
- How's things at work?
- Good.

1270
01:26:47,930 --> 01:26:51,229
Mother, what do you keep asking God for?

1271
01:26:51,574 --> 01:26:53,916
Beautiful wives for the two of you.

1272
01:26:54,049 --> 01:26:55,890
That will give you
a reason to stay at home.

1273
01:26:55,914 --> 01:26:59,370
We were about to almost
get a wife for one of us today.

1274
01:27:01,767 --> 01:27:04,587
Like you got pulled towards your home...

1275
01:27:04,823 --> 01:27:07,831
...I hope that your father
might return as well.

1276
01:27:08,010 --> 01:27:09,010
Father?

1277
01:27:09,186 --> 01:27:11,586
Mother, you never told me about him.

1278
01:27:12,313 --> 01:27:16,129
I have kept it hidden in
my heart from quite some time.

1279
01:27:16,731 --> 01:27:20,928
I thought you might take a wrong step.

1280
01:27:21,841 --> 01:27:25,370
But now, it is time to tell you.

1281
01:27:25,601 --> 01:27:29,797
What's the secret that
you needed to hide it from me?

1282
01:27:31,171 --> 01:27:34,899
My parents had to keep
your father with them...

1283
01:27:35,182 --> 01:27:37,515
...because I didn't have a brother.

1284
01:27:38,801 --> 01:27:43,111
But my uncles wanted
to take over our land.

1285
01:27:43,395 --> 01:27:45,649
Then what happened, mother?

1286
01:27:46,038 --> 01:27:51,621
My uncle fixed a false
case against your father.

1287
01:27:51,905 --> 01:27:57,053
By bribing inspector Muktair,
who was your father friend.

1288
01:27:58,195 --> 01:27:59,671
Then father got punished?

1289
01:27:59,695 --> 01:28:04,543
No son, police says that he
ran away before the hearing took place.

1290
01:28:04,952 --> 01:28:07,616
Some say that he went across the border.

1291
01:28:07,640 --> 01:28:10,363
And some say that he went abroad.

1292
01:28:16,132 --> 01:28:19,990
I too want to share
something with you, mother.

1293
01:28:21,425 --> 01:28:23,209
I don't have a big job.

1294
01:28:24,825 --> 01:28:30,177
You son sells drugs which
ruins other people's life.

1295
01:28:36,223 --> 01:28:37,936
Tell me that you are lying.

1296
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:41,608
Get out of my house.
Why didn't I die before I heard this?

1297
01:28:41,717 --> 01:28:43,214
I didn't bring you up right.

1298
01:28:43,238 --> 01:28:45,754
You have returned
as a devil in disguise.

1299
01:28:45,778 --> 01:28:46,928
Get lost from here.

1300
01:28:46,952 --> 01:28:48,441
- Mother!
- Leave this place.

1301
01:28:48,465 --> 01:28:49,865
Don't show me your face again.

1302
01:28:49,889 --> 01:28:51,215
Go back to where you came from.

1303
01:28:51,239 --> 01:28:52,943
- Go away. Get lost.
- Listen to me, mother.

1304
01:28:52,967 --> 01:28:53,967
Go away. Get lost.

1305
01:28:53,968 --> 01:28:55,283
I have realised my mistake, mother.

1306
01:28:55,307 --> 01:28:56,745
- Let's go.
- Don't show me your face again.

1307
01:28:58,620 --> 01:29:00,477
Try to understand, mother.

1308
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:11,403
Manager, reserve this seat
permanently for our youth president.

1309
01:29:11,671 --> 01:29:14,596
The person whose seat
it was got promoted.

1310
01:29:14,723 --> 01:29:16,590
And he has become a VIP now.

1311
01:29:19,718 --> 01:29:21,914
What is wrong?
Where are you lost?

1312
01:29:21,938 --> 01:29:23,920
Come back to our party, man.

1313
01:29:24,853 --> 01:29:27,720
Even alcohol seems
to be betraying me today.

1314
01:29:28,418 --> 01:29:30,885
It is not getting me drunk.

1315
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:34,884
Then try something new.

1316
01:29:35,088 --> 01:29:37,888
We will know whether
it is pure or diluted.

1317
01:29:38,146 --> 01:29:40,543
- No, I don't do drugs.
- Take it.

1318
01:29:52,344 --> 01:29:56,405
This is poison that
takes away your money.

1319
01:29:57,389 --> 01:29:59,856
Once it enters your body it ruins it.

1320
01:30:00,771 --> 01:30:05,157
It ruins your honour
at home and in the society.

1321
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:10,259
There are fights all the time.
There is no peace in the house.

1322
01:30:11,416 --> 01:30:17,267
Heroin can turn a well to
do person into a beggar and a thief.

1323
01:30:17,756 --> 01:30:21,339
Well done.
You have given a great speech.

1324
01:30:21,995 --> 01:30:25,579
I will ask dad to
take you along on stage.

1325
01:30:26,066 --> 01:30:28,000
You are good at giving lectures.

1326
01:30:28,024 --> 01:30:33,243
"I hope I don't turn into a poem,
falling in love with you."

1327
01:30:43,555 --> 01:30:45,748
Let's ask Karaj bhai
where he has reached.

1328
01:30:45,772 --> 01:30:47,457
Call and ask him.

1329
01:30:47,537 --> 01:30:49,920
And let's go and collect
the money from home.

1330
01:30:49,944 --> 01:30:51,944
We need to give them to Baiji.

1331
01:30:57,901 --> 01:30:59,580
Help! Help!

1332
01:31:02,925 --> 01:31:05,632
"The entered into a fight
to help someone unknown."

1333
01:31:05,656 --> 01:31:06,883
"To help someone unknown."

1334
01:31:06,907 --> 01:31:09,409
"The entered into a fight
to help someone unknown."

1335
01:31:09,433 --> 01:31:11,949
"They started fighting for them."

1336
01:31:12,247 --> 01:31:16,009
"They fought and caused a traffic jam."

1337
01:31:16,089 --> 01:31:17,483
"Two groups started fighting."

1338
01:31:17,507 --> 01:31:19,507
"Two groups started fighting."

1339
01:31:20,121 --> 01:31:22,665
"Two groups started fighting."

1340
01:31:22,861 --> 01:31:24,434
Damn you!

1341
01:31:51,075 --> 01:31:52,680
Let me go!

1342
01:32:04,498 --> 01:32:06,224
Papa, I don't know what would have happened

1343
01:32:06,225 --> 01:32:08,191
if those boys in that car
wouldn't have helped me.

1344
01:32:08,215 --> 01:32:10,137
No, my dear. It's okay.

1345
01:32:34,224 --> 01:32:36,368
- Hello?
- Jogga?

1346
01:32:36,991 --> 01:32:38,171
Hello, Baiji.

1347
01:32:38,334 --> 01:32:40,495
I am staying in Hotel Gagan.
Come here.

1348
01:32:40,519 --> 01:32:41,787
Okay, Baiji.

1349
01:32:42,278 --> 01:32:43,790
We got into trouble last night, Jogga.

1350
01:32:43,814 --> 01:32:46,081
A gun was fired and a man is dead.

1351
01:32:48,334 --> 01:32:51,001
But my pistol still has all the bullets.

1352
01:32:51,878 --> 01:32:53,582
They must have traced our car by now.

1353
01:32:53,606 --> 01:32:55,206
Let's leave it here.

1354
01:32:55,345 --> 01:32:57,145
Let's get out of here then.

1355
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:22,412
Stop over here.

1356
01:33:26,042 --> 01:33:27,465
Here.

1357
01:33:38,042 --> 01:33:41,520
- Hello, Baiji.
- Hello to everyone.

1358
01:33:41,995 --> 01:33:43,795
- Come, son.
- Hello, Baiji.

1359
01:33:46,570 --> 01:33:48,614
Jogga, talk to the MLA.

1360
01:33:49,071 --> 01:33:50,877
He has contacts.
He can suppress the matter.

1361
01:33:50,901 --> 01:33:51,901
What happened?

1362
01:33:51,902 --> 01:33:53,662
Baiji, when we left
the hotel yesterday...

1363
01:33:53,686 --> 01:33:55,227
...a few boys were kidnapping a girl.

1364
01:33:55,251 --> 01:33:57,018
He killed a minister's son.

1365
01:33:57,042 --> 01:33:59,225
Let's go live and talk
to the minister about it.

1366
01:33:59,249 --> 01:34:00,695
What do you have to say about this, sir?

1367
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:02,583
I don't know any Jogga.

1368
01:34:02,663 --> 01:34:06,548
As far as our party is concerned,
we have nothing to do with him.

1369
01:34:06,572 --> 01:34:09,587
We heard that you had
a lot of meetings with him.

1370
01:34:09,611 --> 01:34:11,993
He kept visiting your house.
What do you have to say about this?

1371
01:34:12,017 --> 01:34:14,403
I am an elected
representative of the people.

1372
01:34:14,427 --> 01:34:17,200
So many people come
to visit me every day.

1373
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:18,555
Today you are here.

1374
01:34:18,579 --> 01:34:20,652
Tomorrow if you go and kill someone...

1375
01:34:20,676 --> 01:34:22,222
...will I be held responsible
for that as well?

1376
01:34:22,246 --> 01:34:23,673
Stop blabbering.
Let's go.

1377
01:34:23,697 --> 01:34:25,326
When we tried to talk to the minister...

1378
01:34:25,350 --> 01:34:26,979
...he tried to evade the questions.

1379
01:34:27,003 --> 01:34:31,163
Now let's see how long does
it take for the police to arrest them.

1380
01:34:31,364 --> 01:34:32,404
Hello, Mehak?

1381
01:34:32,524 --> 01:34:34,315
Gabby isn't answering our calls.

1382
01:34:34,339 --> 01:34:36,019
We are in Hotel Gagan.

1383
01:34:36,104 --> 01:34:38,711
If you speak to him,
tell him to call us immediately.

1384
01:34:38,735 --> 01:34:39,988
It's urgent.

1385
01:34:40,404 --> 01:34:43,357
They were shallow vessels,
they spilled too soon.

1386
01:34:43,381 --> 01:34:45,598
How could I trust them!

1387
01:34:45,678 --> 01:34:47,178
Don't worry, dad.

1388
01:34:47,258 --> 01:34:50,774
Shut up and sit right there.
You'll get whatever you want right here.

1389
01:34:50,798 --> 01:34:53,098
You don't need to go out.
Keep your phone switched off.

1390
01:34:53,122 --> 01:34:54,344
Or else I'll break your legs.

1391
01:34:54,368 --> 01:34:55,368
Dad!

1392
01:34:56,091 --> 01:34:58,175
Elections are around the corner.

1393
01:34:58,199 --> 01:35:00,399
They got me into new trouble now.

1394
01:35:01,403 --> 01:35:03,813
Boys, I suggest you go back to Delhi.

1395
01:35:03,837 --> 01:35:05,370
I'll handle everything over here.

1396
01:35:05,394 --> 01:35:08,264
Why should we run when
we didn't kill him, Baiji?

1397
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:10,401
But we are accused of the murder.

1398
01:35:10,425 --> 01:35:12,105
Don't be stubborn, Jogga.

1399
01:35:12,202 --> 01:35:15,015
I cannot run anymore, Baiji.

1400
01:35:15,419 --> 01:35:17,085
I am going to surrender myself.

1401
01:35:17,109 --> 01:35:18,739
You guys can leave if you want, Deepa.

1402
01:35:18,763 --> 01:35:21,390
We have always been together,
since childhood.

1403
01:35:21,414 --> 01:35:23,347
You want us to leave you now?

1404
01:35:23,723 --> 01:35:24,723
Well done.

1405
01:35:25,741 --> 01:35:29,063
Forget living without you,
we cannot even die without you.

1406
01:35:29,087 --> 01:35:30,203
Trios?

1407
01:35:31,471 --> 01:35:35,079
The boy who died his father
is contesting the elections.

1408
01:35:36,319 --> 01:35:39,308
I won't be able to do
anything if some other team.

1409
01:35:39,332 --> 01:35:40,639
It won't be in my hands.

1410
01:35:40,663 --> 01:35:42,597
That's why you will have to surrender.

1411
01:35:42,621 --> 01:35:44,902
We don't need to worry
as long as you are here.

1412
01:35:44,926 --> 01:35:46,838
Phones aren't allowed in there.

1413
01:35:46,862 --> 01:35:48,928
You can get everything inside.

1414
01:35:51,838 --> 01:35:53,518
Give me a pen, Gabby.

1415
01:35:59,807 --> 01:36:01,874
Baiji, this is my home address.

1416
01:36:02,229 --> 01:36:03,909
My mother will be home.

1417
01:36:04,032 --> 01:36:05,712
Money's in the green bag.

1418
01:36:05,986 --> 01:36:08,786
Ask her for it and
she will give it to you.

1419
01:36:08,904 --> 01:36:10,144
Okay, fine.
Take care of yourself.

1420
01:36:10,168 --> 01:36:11,193
Yes, okay.

1421
01:36:11,746 --> 01:36:13,106
Take this, Gabby.

1422
01:36:16,638 --> 01:36:17,730
Yes, sir.

1423
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:19,183
Yes, sir.

1424
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:23,287
I'll update you as soon
as I have any information.

1425
01:36:23,453 --> 01:36:24,453
Okay.

1426
01:36:24,856 --> 01:36:27,520
Gabby, you guys leave. I'll be there.

1427
01:36:28,464 --> 01:36:30,814
Be careful, Jogga.
Don't do anything stupid.

1428
01:36:30,838 --> 01:36:34,234
I am risking my job
and trying to save you guys.

1429
01:36:34,467 --> 01:36:37,072
What such work do you
have where we cannot go along?

1430
01:36:37,096 --> 01:36:38,622
I am going to meet mother.

1431
01:36:38,646 --> 01:36:41,500
Mother is in shock since
last night because of that thing.

1432
01:36:41,524 --> 01:36:45,574
I don't want her to think wrong
about all of us by seeing us together.

1433
01:36:45,598 --> 01:36:47,827
Don't worry. I'll be back soon.

1434
01:36:47,907 --> 01:36:51,061
Jogga, police has set
up check posts everywhere.

1435
01:36:52,296 --> 01:36:54,712
Do one thing, take Mehak with you.

1436
01:36:54,926 --> 01:36:58,190
No one gets suspicious,
if you have a girl with you.

1437
01:36:58,329 --> 01:36:59,329
Be careful.

1438
01:36:59,638 --> 01:37:01,313
Meet us at the high hills.

1439
01:37:01,337 --> 01:37:02,774
We'll show that we
arrest you guys there.

1440
01:37:02,798 --> 01:37:03,798
Let's go.

1441
01:37:35,337 --> 01:37:36,337
Mother?

1442
01:37:43,405 --> 01:37:44,416
Mother?

1443
01:37:47,574 --> 01:37:48,574
Mother?

1444
01:37:48,575 --> 01:37:50,255
Open the door, mother.

1445
01:37:51,635 --> 01:37:52,635
Mother?

1446
01:37:53,196 --> 01:37:54,876
Open the door, mother.

1447
01:37:57,101 --> 01:37:58,837
Open the door just once.

1448
01:38:00,788 --> 01:38:02,468
Open the door, mother.

1449
01:38:02,928 --> 01:38:04,608
I want to make amends.

1450
01:38:04,898 --> 01:38:07,237
I have realised my mistake.

1451
01:38:08,322 --> 01:38:11,429
I am going to surrender
myself to the police.

1452
01:38:13,335 --> 01:38:14,758
Just once.

1453
01:38:16,864 --> 01:38:19,767
Just place your hand on my head, mother.

1454
01:38:21,320 --> 01:38:25,292
If I had taken your blessings
the last time I had left...

1455
01:38:27,181 --> 01:38:33,300
...then perhaps I wouldn't have
ended up in this filthy business.

1456
01:38:35,158 --> 01:38:37,166
Believe me, mother.

1457
01:38:38,820 --> 01:38:43,639
I will never do anything
that would hurt your feelings again.

1458
01:38:45,683 --> 01:38:47,954
I don't deserve to be forgiven.

1459
01:38:49,454 --> 01:38:52,799
But please forgive me if you can.

1460
01:38:54,667 --> 01:38:57,166
Bye, mother. I am leaving.

1461
01:39:20,691 --> 01:39:22,152
'What was Jogga doing here?'

1462
01:39:22,176 --> 01:39:25,504
'He perhaps came to tell
his mother about the money.'

1463
01:39:35,103 --> 01:39:36,588
Davinder, you?

1464
01:39:41,413 --> 01:39:43,915
Where did you go leaving us alone?

1465
01:39:44,197 --> 01:39:46,416
You didn't miss us at all?

1466
01:40:27,389 --> 01:40:29,776
oh God, how did this happen?

1467
01:40:33,818 --> 01:40:39,462
Deepa, you said that we have
always done everything together.

1468
01:40:40,349 --> 01:40:42,423
Then how could you die alone?

1469
01:40:57,311 --> 01:41:01,087
'Forget living without you,
we cannot even die without you.'

1470
01:41:04,822 --> 01:41:06,570
Battery!

1471
01:41:16,923 --> 01:41:18,000
Shoot me.

1472
01:41:18,491 --> 01:41:19,491
Come on.

1473
01:41:21,895 --> 01:41:24,362
Poor Jogga isn't capable of anything.

1474
01:41:36,163 --> 01:41:37,378
Mehak, you too?

1475
01:41:37,702 --> 01:41:42,023
The girl you spent your life
loving is standing right next to me.

1476
01:41:42,645 --> 01:41:45,460
I have all the bullets of your pistol.

1477
01:41:48,566 --> 01:41:50,414
I feel so sorry for you.

1478
01:41:51,696 --> 01:41:55,056
You look like a beggar outside a temple.

1479
01:41:56,018 --> 01:41:59,384
I feel like giving all
the bullets back to you.

1480
01:42:01,350 --> 01:42:05,251
But I cannot, as the police
department won't allow me to.

1481
01:42:05,488 --> 01:42:11,796
I knew that we either will die
in prison or get shot by the police.

1482
01:42:13,655 --> 01:42:15,350
I didn't deserve Mehak.

1483
01:42:16,001 --> 01:42:18,978
I was anyway going to
ask you to look after Mehak.

1484
01:42:19,002 --> 01:42:21,339
You thought that you
would drive a fancy car...

1485
01:42:21,363 --> 01:42:25,139
...and I'll get impressed
and choose you as my life partner?

1486
01:42:25,287 --> 01:42:27,389
How... how could
you even think about it?

1487
01:42:27,413 --> 01:42:29,443
You are a petty criminal.

1488
01:42:30,070 --> 01:42:32,532
You know I love Gabby.

1489
01:42:33,123 --> 01:42:35,748
I joined your group
because he asked me to...

1490
01:42:35,772 --> 01:42:37,875
...and leaked all your information.

1491
01:42:37,899 --> 01:42:40,432
Remember the dialogue you used to say?

1492
01:42:40,910 --> 01:42:43,711
Friendly policemen, disloyal women...

1493
01:42:43,874 --> 01:42:46,396
I don't remember the rest.
It was something like that, right?

1494
01:42:46,420 --> 01:42:47,715
It suits him.

1495
01:42:48,464 --> 01:42:50,624
You did all this for Mehak?

1496
01:42:51,332 --> 01:42:54,439
But Deepa and Battery?

1497
01:42:55,582 --> 01:42:57,262
What was their fault?

1498
01:42:57,384 --> 01:42:59,651
All three of you will have to die.

1499
01:43:00,184 --> 01:43:03,407
The one who asked me do this is your...

1500
01:43:04,827 --> 01:43:05,988
- 'Inspector?
- Yes?'

1501
01:43:06,012 --> 01:43:07,942
'Can I have a word with you?'

1502
01:43:07,966 --> 01:43:13,177
'End the story in such a
way that only the king stays alive.'

1503
01:43:13,917 --> 01:43:17,707
'Secrets will get revealed
if they stay alive.'

1504
01:43:18,856 --> 01:43:20,504
Karaj bhai cannot do this.

1505
01:43:20,528 --> 01:43:23,528
I was issued death warrant
once by MLA Bhuttar...

1506
01:43:23,552 --> 01:43:25,013
...the one whose you
guys are disciples of.

1507
01:43:25,037 --> 01:43:27,364
He promised me money
as well as promotion.

1508
01:43:27,388 --> 01:43:30,396
And the other by the
MLA whose son was murdered.

1509
01:43:30,482 --> 01:43:32,162
That I can believe in.

1510
01:43:32,530 --> 01:43:33,771
And they are capable of doing that.

1511
01:43:33,795 --> 01:43:36,328
And another childhood friend of yours.

1512
01:43:36,959 --> 01:43:41,440
Inspector,
I am restricted by these prison walls.

1513
01:43:41,585 --> 01:43:44,886
Otherwise, it won't take me long.

1514
01:43:45,095 --> 01:43:47,584
If you are so desperate then
why don't you come out and do it?

1515
01:43:47,608 --> 01:43:49,786
I cannot wait any longer.

1516
01:43:50,082 --> 01:43:51,762
I just want him dead.

1517
01:43:51,811 --> 01:43:56,174
If I do it, it will be considered
as a murder by law.

1518
01:43:56,726 --> 01:43:59,960
If you do it, it will be an encounter.

1519
01:44:01,288 --> 01:44:04,867
Eradicating criminals from the society.

1520
01:44:07,178 --> 01:44:08,858
The job will be done.

1521
01:44:09,309 --> 01:44:12,976
Then you will get the reward
even before you ask for it.

1522
01:44:14,239 --> 01:44:16,307
Remember what you did to Jagga,
don't you?

1523
01:44:16,331 --> 01:44:21,407
We didn't do anything compared
to what Jagga had done to us.

1524
01:44:22,022 --> 01:44:25,855
If he hadn't told
the inspector about us...

1525
01:44:26,654 --> 01:44:29,689
...then our train wouldn't
have gone off the track.

1526
01:44:29,713 --> 01:44:32,814
Not Jagga,
I told the inspector about you guys.

1527
01:44:33,659 --> 01:44:38,516
I still cannot believe
that you can do such things.

1528
01:44:39,960 --> 01:44:40,960
But why?

1529
01:44:41,074 --> 01:44:42,074
Why?

1530
01:44:42,982 --> 01:44:48,323
Because the inspector your
father murdered was my father.

1531
01:44:48,940 --> 01:44:50,182
You are lying.

1532
01:44:50,262 --> 01:44:52,395
Your mother won't lie, will she.

1533
01:44:52,630 --> 01:44:54,883
I heard this story
when I was a little boy...

1534
01:44:54,907 --> 01:44:57,851
...your mother had recited it,
in my own house.

1535
01:44:58,763 --> 01:45:02,719
I lost my father because
of that incident.

1536
01:45:03,104 --> 01:45:05,677
And my mother... became a widow.

1537
01:45:06,470 --> 01:45:08,999
We have waited for your
father's murderer for a long time.

1538
01:45:09,023 --> 01:45:12,095
You can seek revenge
from children too, you know.

1539
01:45:12,227 --> 01:45:13,956
Settle the account.

1540
01:45:15,478 --> 01:45:18,011
Your father wasn't an angel either.

1541
01:45:18,543 --> 01:45:20,989
He betrayed my father.

1542
01:45:21,156 --> 01:45:23,156
I was looking for your father.

1543
01:45:23,562 --> 01:45:25,242
But I couldn't find him.

1544
01:45:25,318 --> 01:45:27,986
To seek revenge from him,
I am the one...

1545
01:45:28,339 --> 01:45:31,139
...who caused a rift
between you and Jagga.

1546
01:45:31,424 --> 01:45:35,200
When you guys ran away to
Delhi after stealing the grains...

1547
01:45:35,613 --> 01:45:37,959
...I felt some peace in my heart.

1548
01:45:38,447 --> 01:45:41,132
So, you pretended to be my friend.

1549
01:45:41,212 --> 01:45:42,465
What friendship?

1550
01:45:42,489 --> 01:45:44,279
When you all came back from Delhi...

1551
01:45:44,303 --> 01:45:47,085
...my desire to get revenge
came back to life.

1552
01:45:47,109 --> 01:45:49,353
I wanted Jagga to kill you all.

1553
01:45:49,846 --> 01:45:52,205
That's why I took you
to that restaurant that day.

1554
01:45:52,229 --> 01:45:53,589
Then at the mall.

1555
01:45:54,926 --> 01:45:57,153
But you guys managed to escape.

1556
01:45:57,887 --> 01:46:01,489
Now tell me who killed that boy as well.

1557
01:46:03,120 --> 01:46:04,894
Killed who? The MLA's son?

1558
01:46:05,042 --> 01:46:06,208
I was behind that as well.

1559
01:46:06,232 --> 01:46:08,211
I got my men join his group.

1560
01:46:08,351 --> 01:46:10,296
Then are the ones
who kidnapped the girl.

1561
01:46:10,320 --> 01:46:14,160
You took your gun out and
one of my men fired his gun.

1562
01:46:14,458 --> 01:46:17,100
That resulted in you
getting another enemy.

1563
01:46:17,124 --> 01:46:21,532
Then these four death
angels surrounded you.

1564
01:46:22,259 --> 01:46:24,224
You lost, Jogga.

1565
01:46:25,061 --> 01:46:28,837
I never valued winning or
losing when it came to friendship.

1566
01:46:36,209 --> 01:46:38,619
There is just one bullet.
Who will you shoot?

1567
01:46:38,643 --> 01:46:41,939
Disloyal beloved or
a friend who turned enemy?

1568
01:46:43,988 --> 01:46:45,805
This is a serious dilemma.

1569
01:46:53,385 --> 01:46:55,385
I could have shot you as well.

1570
01:46:55,639 --> 01:46:58,621
But I don't want to kill you.
I want to keep you alive.

1571
01:46:58,645 --> 01:47:03,747
So that you regret killing two innocent
friends for the rest of your life.

1572
01:47:03,989 --> 01:47:05,963
You consider me your enemy.

1573
01:47:06,339 --> 01:47:08,672
But for me, you are still a friend.

1574
01:47:11,746 --> 01:47:13,914
And I am about to
be killed by my friend.

1575
01:47:13,938 --> 01:47:16,973
What could make me happier?

1576
01:47:17,237 --> 01:47:22,682
Anyway, I cannot survive
without Deepa and Battery.

1577
01:47:24,068 --> 01:47:25,151
Shoot me.

1578
01:47:26,907 --> 01:47:28,361
Come on, shoot me.

1579
01:47:28,835 --> 01:47:30,275
There you go then.

1580
01:47:48,929 --> 01:47:53,928
"If you and I were to compete somewhere,
you back stabber..."

1581
01:47:54,212 --> 01:47:57,460
"If you and I were to compete somewhere,
you betrayer..."

1582
01:47:57,484 --> 01:48:00,877
"You wouldn't have found
a way to escape, my dear."

1583
01:48:01,225 --> 01:48:06,931
"My dear, who are you
crushing under your feet now?"

1584
01:48:25,271 --> 01:48:26,311
Sorry, Mehak.

1585
01:48:26,542 --> 01:48:29,050
If you can betray someone
who loved you more than his own life...

1586
01:48:29,074 --> 01:48:32,564
...then how can you
be loyal to anyone else?

1587
01:48:33,078 --> 01:48:38,750
Anyway, private persons can cause
trouble in top-secret government matters.

1588
01:48:39,243 --> 01:48:40,243
Bye.

1589
01:48:50,168 --> 01:48:52,353
- Jogga!
- Jogga, my son!

1590
01:48:54,209 --> 01:48:55,974
What is wrong with my son?

1591
01:48:58,812 --> 01:49:01,933
- Take care of yourself, mother.
- What happened?

1592
01:49:02,166 --> 01:49:08,507
I want someone like you as
my mother in my next life as well.

1593
01:49:09,670 --> 01:49:12,764
Give me your blessings, mother.

1594
01:49:13,893 --> 01:49:18,208
I am very tired.

1595
01:49:18,956 --> 01:49:24,991
Can I sleep on your lap?

1596
01:49:26,624 --> 01:49:30,151
Please massage my head, mother.

1597
01:49:30,331 --> 01:49:32,011
Don't lose hope, son.

1598
01:49:32,548 --> 01:49:35,339
Bye, Baiji.

1599
01:49:35,659 --> 01:49:38,986
Don't call me Baiji, Jogga!
I am your father!

1600
01:49:39,479 --> 01:49:42,344
Call me father, Jogga!

1601
01:49:46,473 --> 01:49:55,646
"I might have many faults and flaws."

1602
01:49:58,327 --> 01:50:04,821
"But still my loved ones..."

1603
01:50:06,413 --> 01:50:14,470
"But still my loved
ones will cry for me..."

1604
01:50:16,266 --> 01:50:19,078
Today on high hills,
near the city bypass...

1605
01:50:19,102 --> 01:50:22,087
...three dangerous gangsters Jogga,
Deepa, Battery...

1606
01:50:22,111 --> 01:50:25,100
...and a female accomplice
died in police encounter.

1607
01:50:25,124 --> 01:50:27,724
A police officer lost his life as well.

1608
01:50:27,849 --> 01:50:32,545
This is Gurleen Batra live from the crime
scene for the News Channel, Ferozpur.

1609
01:50:32,569 --> 01:50:41,559
Like the saying goes when elephants
fight, it is the grass that suffers.

1610
01:50:42,404 --> 01:50:49,161
This is first time that both
the grass and the elephants suffered.

1611
01:50:53,775 --> 01:50:57,667
Here you go.
Check out his weapon.

1612
01:50:58,329 --> 01:50:59,849
See how good it is.

1613
01:51:00,737 --> 01:51:04,705
Also decide who gets shot
in the hand who gets shot in the leg.

1614
01:51:05,140 --> 01:51:07,768
We need to report
close firing in the case.

1615
01:51:07,792 --> 01:51:08,792
Right?

1616
01:51:10,232 --> 01:51:12,165
You guys will never progress.

1617
01:51:13,022 --> 01:51:16,919
'I couldn't save the life
of the one who saved my daughter.'

1618
01:51:18,830 --> 01:51:23,080
Our job is to end
crime and not criminals.

1619
01:51:23,642 --> 01:51:25,334
It is because of such officials that...

1620
01:51:25,358 --> 01:51:27,039
...criminals don't want
to choose the right path.

1621
01:51:27,063 --> 01:51:29,695
He killed the one who saved
my daughter right in front of me.

1622
01:51:29,719 --> 01:51:31,274
I regretfully couldn't
do anything about.

1623
01:51:31,298 --> 01:51:33,528
Not all public servants are the same.

1624
01:51:33,552 --> 01:51:38,125
Our department has a bad name
because of filthy people like you.

1625
01:51:40,580 --> 01:51:43,047
Jagga bhai, you have been bailed out.

1626
01:52:14,100 --> 01:52:19,412
'Just like a snake,
our mind too produces poison.'

1627
01:52:19,898 --> 01:52:25,561
'Our mind uses that poison as a weapon.'

1628
01:52:25,998 --> 01:52:28,541
'Pistol, rifle, tank, missile.'

1629
01:52:28,621 --> 01:52:31,171
'These things are
operated by our hands.'

1630
01:52:31,195 --> 01:52:34,886
'But our hands our
commanded by our mind.'

1631
01:52:35,283 --> 01:52:38,407
'We think that weapons kills people.'

1632
01:52:38,695 --> 01:52:42,070
'But what kills people
is a person's mind.'

1633
01:52:53,855 --> 01:52:56,302
"We are a little different.
We are a little crazy."

1634
01:52:56,326 --> 01:52:59,209
"We don't forget the
ones who mess with us."

1635
01:52:59,289 --> 01:53:04,447
"We have enough wealth and fame.
We only seek God's blessings and refuge."

1636
01:53:06,504 --> 01:53:08,996
"We are a little different.
We are a little crazy."

1637
01:53:09,020 --> 01:53:11,867
"We don't forget the
ones who mess with us."

1638
01:53:11,891 --> 01:53:17,006
"We have enough wealth and fame.
We only seek God's blessings and refuge."

1639
01:53:26,816 --> 01:53:29,283
"Tell me, who wants to challenge me?"

1640
01:53:29,314 --> 01:53:31,981
"Jagga, Jaggera is standing right here."

1641
01:53:32,034 --> 01:53:36,807
"I have taken care of
all those who acted smart."

1642
01:53:36,887 --> 01:53:42,596
"Death follows those
who try to mess with us."

1643
01:53:43,218 --> 01:53:46,722
"We are a little different.
We are a little crazy."

1644
01:53:46,802 --> 01:53:49,556
"We don't forget the
ones who mess with us."

1645
01:53:49,580 --> 01:53:54,466
"We have enough wealth and fame.
We only seek God's blessings and refuge."

1646
01:54:04,863 --> 01:54:09,713
"We are true to our friends.
We don't fight over girls."

1647
01:54:09,793 --> 01:54:14,678
"We don't entertain those people
who don't meet our expectations."

1648
01:54:15,130 --> 01:54:20,332
"We are as furious as fire.
We have been wild since forever."

1649
01:54:22,318 --> 01:54:24,860
"We are a little different.
We are a little crazy."

1650
01:54:24,884 --> 01:54:27,469
"We don't forget the
ones who mess with us."

1651
01:54:27,493 --> 01:54:33,564
"We have enough wealth and fame.
We only seek God's blessings and refuge."
