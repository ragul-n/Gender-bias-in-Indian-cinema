1
00:00:44,007 --> 00:00:46,907
Oh! God! Give us good mind
and strength to fight...

2
00:00:47,012 --> 00:00:49,112
... the bad things in life.

3
00:00:59,617 --> 00:01:00,917
Laxmi!
- Yes?

4
00:01:01,966 --> 00:01:06,066
You have given me two beautiful sons.
Again you...

5
00:01:06,093 --> 00:01:08,493
... are expecting. This time give
me a small and beautiful...

6
00:01:08,517 --> 00:01:09,717
... doll like daughter.

7
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:13,144
So, you are yearning for
a daughter? - Yes.

8
00:01:14,244 --> 00:01:15,944
Come, Raju son.
Let us go and...

9
00:01:15,968 --> 00:01:17,368
... give breakfast to our masters.

10
00:01:17,395 --> 00:01:20,095
Father, why do you tie this
scarf in your waist?

11
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:29,410
I am a very old servant of this
house, son. That is why. Here.

12
00:01:29,434 --> 00:01:31,534
Here is comes. Breakfast has come.

13
00:01:31,605 --> 00:01:34,105
Mother, come fast. The
breakfast is hot.

14
00:01:34,515 --> 00:01:39,515
Son Chander! Son Suraj! Come.

15
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,300
Brother Dhiru, i don't know
what you mix in the food.

16
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,100
It is always so tasty
that i am becoming fat.

17
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,300
Master i mix the same kind of
love which you all always...

18
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,700
... give me. Otherwise what else
does this poor Brahmin has?

19
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,700
Con Raju, son you too come and
sit down here on the chair.

20
00:02:02,702 --> 00:02:06,102
No, he can not sit here
with us. Come on. Get up.

21
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,000
Chander! Stop it.
It is bad behavior.

22
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,500
I'll sit down, mother.

23
00:02:13,724 --> 00:02:16,724
Papa, she is our mother and not his.

24
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,700
Do not speak like that, son.

25
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,100
Don't you ever say such
a bad thing again.

26
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,700
Son, Raju has also drunk my milk.

27
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,700
That is why he is also my son.

28
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,500
The children who talk
bad things are bad.

29
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,100
No Laxmi, you'll see that one
day our sons will shine...

30
00:02:33,121 --> 00:02:35,321
... like the Moon and the sun.

31
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,100
And we'll proudly tell the world
that we are their parents.

32
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,700
Come on sons, drink your milk fast.

33
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,200
I'll drop all three of them
to the school on my way to...

34
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,400
... the office.

35
00:02:53,884 --> 00:02:57,884
FOREST DEPT. RAMGARII.

36
00:02:59,614 --> 00:03:02,114
Please come, Kunvar Sahib.
Please come.

37
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,000
Forrest Officer, do not call
me Kunvar Sahib. Call me...

38
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,400
... Raja Sahib.

39
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,300
But your else brother
is Raja Sahib.

40
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,400
My elder brother is
a live dead body.

41
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,900
He is a Raja in just name.

42
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,500
What does he do except
waiting for his death.

43
00:03:18,308 --> 00:03:23,008
I look after his kingdom. And
you are a mere worker of...

44
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:24,798
... my kingdom.

45
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,300
I think that you'll never be able
to forget that the British have...

46
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,500
... gone back from here and
now the Government of...

47
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,800
... India is ruling our country.

48
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,900
The Government of India?
It has snatch away our...

49
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,100
... kingdom from us.

50
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,500
It is true that right now our
financial condition is not...

51
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,000
... very sound. But our palaces
are witness to the fact that...

52
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,100
... i am not an ordinary human being.

53
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,700
I am still a Raja, Officer.
I am a Raja by birth.

54
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,400
Who is shooting these bullets?

55
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,000
Hunting is banned in this Jungle.

56
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,900
Run! The Police have come. Run!

57
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:38,883
Don't be afraid.

58
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,500
Decoits. Decoits. There is Gold
worth millions in the van.

59
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,100
And it belongs to the
Government of India.

60
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,300
Gold worth millions?

61
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,200
Wait! This is Goverment's treasure.

62
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,800
Move away.

63
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,200
Water! Water!
- You want water?

64
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,500
I'll go and fetch water.

65
00:05:39,517 --> 00:05:42,517
- No... No!

66
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,500
He is dead. He's dead.

67
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,200
What have you done, Mr. JK?

68
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,019
You have murdered an injured
government worker.

69
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,600
Forget about him. You come here.

70
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,800
Come i'll show you Gold.
A lot of Gold.

71
00:05:58,966 --> 00:06:00,066
See, lot of gold.

72
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,400
We have become millionaires.

73
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,400
But this belongs to the poor
people of our country.

74
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,500
It is food of the hungry.

75
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,900
Let the citizens of the country
go to hell and let the naked...

76
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,300
... and hungry also go to hell.

77
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,600
I'll light up only my palace.

78
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,200
Tell me, do you agree
to share it 50-50.

79
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,800
I was just testing you,
Kunvar Sahib.

80
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,600
For now we should think
of hiding this gold.

81
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,000
No. First of all we should take
car of these dead bodies and...

82
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,700
... this van. You take this van
and go far away somewhere.

83
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,400
You are suspicious of me?

84
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,400
Do not make the mistake of
taking away this gold from here.

85
00:06:50,108 --> 00:06:52,308
Because there is only one
road leading out of this...

86
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,600
... Jungle and i am taking that
road. Do you understand?

87
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:45,000
Open the door. I said open the
door. Where is the gold?

88
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,200
I can not turn a traitor
against my country.

89
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,200
Where have you hidden the gold?

90
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,100
What has happened to you?
Dhiru! Brother Dhiru!

91
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,600
Master! Master! What
has happened to you?

92
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,200
How did this happen? Brother,
please call he doctor fast.

93
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,800
Yes. - No Laxmi. Don't. You
immediately run away from here.

94
00:08:57,508 --> 00:08:59,008
What are you saying?
I'll not leave...

95
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,100
... you in this condition
and go anywhere.

96
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,600
Brother Dhiru, please
call the doctor.

97
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:07,109
No Laxmi, you run away
from here immediately.

98
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,600
Far, far away. Somewhere safe.

99
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,000
But i...
- Swear by your husband.

100
00:09:15,107 --> 00:09:16,307
You are carrying a child.

101
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,000
That murderer will kill
you and my children too.

102
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,700
Who will kill us?

103
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:26,600
You have never seen him.
His name is Ah...

104
00:09:45,707 --> 00:09:49,307
No!
- Papa! Papa!

105
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,300
Madam! Come let us run away
from the back door. Come.

106
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,400
Anand, open the door.

107
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,000
Madam, we all are in danger.
Madam otherwise the...

108
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,700
... children will also be killed.

109
00:10:12,719 --> 00:10:18,019
Find him. Take him immediately
to the cellar...

110
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:26,300
... of my palace. See
that nobody sees you.

111
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,600
Burn the house down so that
no sign of it remains.

112
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,800
Where are his wife and children?

113
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,500
There is no one in the house sir.

114
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,300
That means he has already
told them everything.

115
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,500
Now it is very important for
me that they all should die.

116
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,400
Sir, they are running away.

117
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:42,905
Dhiru!
- Father!

118
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,000
Son, after your mother died
madam has nursed and...

119
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,000
... nurtured you. When the time
comes you should give...

120
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:04,400
... every drop of your blood
for the sake of madam.

121
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,600
Madam, now you save yourself
and the lives of these children.

122
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,400
Don't worry, brother Dhiru.

123
00:12:11,508 --> 00:12:14,008
I'll go straight to the Police
station with the children.

124
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,300
No madam, the killer will be
waiting for you at the Police Station.

125
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,500
You take them somewhere
far away. Far away.

126
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,300
Brother Dhiru! Brother Dhiru!

127
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,700
Doctor? - His pulse is ticking.
His man is still alive.

128
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,300
This man is here,
nobody should know.

129
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,700
Otherwise you'll not remain alive.

130
00:12:58,108 --> 00:13:00,808
Have i disclosed any secret of
yours till date, Raja Sahib?

131
00:13:02,002 --> 00:13:04,202
This man should not die at my cost.

132
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,700
He is worth millions of rupees.

133
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,100
Have faith on me Raja Sahib.
He will not die.

134
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,500
Who are you lady?

135
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,300
I am a suffering woman, priest.

136
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,000
I am wandering in this jungle.
Can we get shelter for a night?

137
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:34,500
I'll leave
at the crack of dawn.

138
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,900
The doors of the temple are
open for even for sinners.

139
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,200
And then you are a helpless
woman, mother.

140
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,200
If you wish you can stay in
the temple for the night.

141
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:49,500
There is a small hut behind the temple
where this servant stays alone.

142
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,600
You? Priest?

143
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,100
I have come to give you salvation.

144
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,500
Come there with me.

145
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:15,400
You scoundrel, sinner.
I spit on you.

146
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,700
You come here with me.

147
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:26,200
Leave her. Leave my mother alone.

148
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,400
Boy, out of my way.

149
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,600
Where will you run escaping from me?

150
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:38,100
Leave my mother.
- Get lost.

151
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,600
Rajju!
- Mother!

152
00:14:57,024 --> 00:15:07,024
Beta Ho To Aisa 1994

153
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:41,600
" I am your mother Yashoda."

154
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,200
" You are my Govinda ( Lord Krishna)."

155
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:56,400
" I'll look at your moon like face."

156
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:01,400
" I'll keep alive."

157
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:06,300
" I am your mother Yashoda."

158
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,500
" You are my Govinda."

159
00:16:26,305 --> 00:16:30,805
" I got a lovely wish."

160
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:36,400
" I got a beautiful boon."

161
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:48,600
" I am very fortunate that i found
God in the form of child."

162
00:16:51,100 --> 00:17:00,400
" In the world corner."

163
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:05,300
" You are flower select."

164
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:10,300
" I am your mother Yashoda."

165
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,600
" You are my Govinda."

166
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,800
Greetings, aunt.

167
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,000
Bantu! You have come?
- Who is this?

168
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,100
He is my friend, Raju. He studies
with me in the school.

169
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,610
Aunt, give him also a job.

170
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,900
There is no work in the
distillery for the kids.

171
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:01,300
My father is dead. I've to admit
my mother to the hospital.

172
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,200
She is lying on the
road. She is ill.

I am the owner of Royal Club,
Kasturilal speaking.

284
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,200
Speak. - Your inspector
had already taken 25%.

285
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,500
I mean, i had sent it two days back.

286
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,500
Then how did the Police come
back here? - What Police?

287
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:04,400

00:24:04,503 --> 00:24:06,703
... them two hundred thousand
and saved my life.

289
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,200
Now i'll have to close
down my business.

290
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,300
No, you continue with your
business without any worry.

291
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:17,400
There might be the government's
seal on the currency.

292
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,400
But in this area
the mint runs on my name.

293
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,700
Raka, call up SP.

294
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,100
Hello!

uniform on your body and the...

296
00:24:37,304 --> 00:24:40,504
... blood running in your veins
is safe because of me?

297
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,300
How can i forget that JK Sahib.

298
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:47,500
Then how did a Police Inspector

00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,600

303
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,000
How dare the Police raids our den.

304
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:02,400
JK has so many teeth in his
mounth that he can eat that...

305
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,300
... officer raw who has dared take
advantage of his uniform...

306
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,000
... and spread his wings in JK's area.

307
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,700
Yes, just a moment. Sir.

308
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,400
JK Sahib, i enquired but no
Police Officer has raided...

309
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,300
... your den sir.
- What?

310
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,500
That means that it is the same
robber who is looting me and...

311
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,100
... my accomplices again and again.

312
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,700
And you both. Ranjit and Robert.

313
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,200
None of you could catch him.

314
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:31,600
You all are useless. He is
just an ordinary robber.

315
00:25:31,602 --> 00:25:35,202
A mere thug. You also
could not catch him.

316
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,500
Shame on you.

317
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:45,200
The day he comes in my hands.
I'll skin him alive.

318
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,700
Nice hat. - Check both the
Police Uniforms, brother.

319
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,700

Here are your five hundred rupees.
- Count it. You never know. - What?

321
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,800
Nothing. I was joking.

322
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,600
How was the show?
- Our show are always houseful.

323

Hurry up. Ma, you did not
tell me, when do you want...

326
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,300
... to shift to the new flat.

00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,100
I'll not leave Raju alone
and go anywhere.

328
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,500
Ma, now i have become a good lawyer.

329
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,700
Staying in a place like
this affects my position.

330
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,300
Here. Take 5 rupees.
- Miser.

331
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,300
Brother Chander, how are you?

332
00:26:35,303 --> 00:26:37,003
Brother Raju, is this
the time to come.

333
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,200
Mother, brother Chander
has become a big lawyer.

334
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,200
Big shots come to take
him in their big cars.

335
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,500
Ok. Now pay attention here.

336
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,200
Good. Have you sent Rakhi

00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,000
I have received his money order too.

339

What has he written?

340
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,200
He has written that his Police
training is complete.

341
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,400
Wow! Then i'll eat double
sweets for that.

342
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,400
Sure. This is one... - Good.
And this is the second piece.

343
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,700
Ok. Now take this Sari.

344
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,400
And here is ten rupees. It
is very less but keep it.

345
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,100
Go get something to eat for him.

346
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,600
Thank you brother.

347
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,300
Ok. Thank you.

348
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,700
What else have you brought?

349
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,600
I've brought this shawl for you.

350
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,500
Asha, hurry up. I am very hungry.

351
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,700
It is already 10 o'clock.

352
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,500
Ten? Oh! My Good! Take this Ma.

353
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,000
I am late for the callege.

354
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,700
Ok. Ma. Ok. Brother, i am going.

355
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:40,200
Ok. Take care. Mother, take
this new pressure cooker.

356
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,400
You get each and everything
for this house.

357
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,300
Look at yourself too sometimes.

358
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,200
Your shirt is torn and this
scarf is also very old.

359
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,300
Mother, i do not have to
go for a government job.

360
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,500
That is why i always used to
tell you that you should've studied.

361
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:56,300
You also would have become a
judge or a lawyer today like them.

362
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,500
The whole night you work
in the theatre group.

363
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,200
You spent your entire life in
giving education to others.

364
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,700
How much have you spent on all this.

365
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,400
What do you want to
do by knowing that?

366
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,900
Oh! Asha has forgotten
her purse here.

367
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,600
Oh! She has gone by
an auto - rickshaw.

368
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,600
How will she pay? I'll go and
give this purse to her and come back.

369
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,600
Raja!
- Yes.

370
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,200
Have your breakfast and go.

371
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,500
Yes, i am very hungry.

372
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,600
Old this. You have not eaten
anything since the morning.

373
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,700
You just keep running everywhere.

374
00:28:23,207 --> 00:28:24,407
Come on eat.

375
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,200
Hold this for a minute.

376
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,000
I'll roll it in the roti (Indian
rolled bread) and take it.

377
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,300
I'll eat it later. Ok?

378
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,300
Ravi, for how long will we keep
meeting secretly like this.

379
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:45,000
I've to make all sorts of excuses
to come and meet you.

380
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,100
Brother!
- You had forgotten your purse.

381
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,100
That is why i went running
o the college.

382
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,100
But i found out that the
college is closed today.

383
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,900
I'd come here for some other
work and i saw you.

384
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,700
Take your purse.

385
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,500
Who is this emperor?
- He is Ravi.

386
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,600
Ok. Now you go home.
- Ok. Ravi, i am going.

387
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,600
Mr. Ravi, where can
i meet your father?

388
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:33,200
I do no have my parents. I
am an orphan. - An orphan?

389
00:29:34,303 --> 00:29:36,203
Yes. I am all alone in this world.

390
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:45,100
Listen, i am a poor man. And
i have only one sister.

391
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,800
If you play with her life
then i'll kill you.

392
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:55,100
Brother, i am a responsible
Police Officer.

393
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,300
And as far as playing with your
sister's life is concerned...

394
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,200
... today i am asking you for your
sister's hand in marriage.

395
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,700
He was asking for your hand.
What should i tell him?

396
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:30,200
As you feel.
- Ok. I'll think it over.

397
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:38,700
You do not worry.
- Brother!

398
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,300
What is it brother?

399
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,400
Ganju, i have put the
meet in the wok. - Ok.

400

You please go and give this
breakfast to baby. - Baby?

401
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,400
She is a witch, witch. You can
see the marks on my face.

402
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:57,800
But my dear man, you are just
defaming a small girl.

403
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,700
I will myself go and give
breakfast to the girl.

404
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,300
Ok. You go.

405
00:31:03,404 --> 00:31:04,704
What nonsense are you talking?

406
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,800
Gangu!
- Yes.

407
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:10,400
Now the attack is going to start.
Come let us start counting backwards.

408
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:14,100
Ok. 5,
- 4 - 3 - 2 - 1...

409
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,600
Help! Please someone save me.

410
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:26,400
Help. She is killing me.
I am going to die.

411
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,600
Master look she has hit me.

412
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:34,300
She has made a paste of me. You
can see what she has done.

413
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,700
Please make her understand.

414
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:46,100
You...! - Daughter, are you
again beating up the servants today?

415
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:50,300
Servant? My foot! I had asked
for a banana in the breakfast.

416
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,400
But that duffer got papaya.

417
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:56,400
But daughter, papaya is good.
It cools the head and the stomach both.

418
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,800
If i like bananas then
i'll take only banana.

419
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:02,600
And if i don't get it then i'll hit these
servants with shoes and set them right.

420
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,600
After all i not he daughter
of some ordinary man.

421
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,000
I am your daughter. I am the
daughter of a multi - millionaire.

422
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,600
Oh! My God! I am late
again. I am going.

423
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,410
Idiot.

424
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,900
He's saved by the length of a hair.

425
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,700
Otherwise she would have killed
him. Thank God he is safe.

426
00:33:01,304 --> 00:33:02,804
My medicine bottle...

427
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:06,500
Son, ask for forgiveness.
- Say sorry to her.

428
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,600
You don't know who she is.

429
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,500
You bloody fool. Are you blind?

430
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,200
Does this road belong
to your father?

431
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:16,200
My mother is sick. Now from
where will i give my mother medicine?

432
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:19,100
You are answering back.
Wait, i'll show you.

433
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,500
You dog!

434
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:28,400
" Do not destroy the world...

435
00:33:28,438 --> 00:33:33,438
... or these poor people."

436
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:40,300
" Do not make fun of these...

437
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:45,200
... innocent people."

438
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,500
" When their days change."

439
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,433
" When their days change."

440
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:34,500
" They will take revenge,
take revenge."

441
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,700
" Of each and everything."

442
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,700
" When their days change."

443
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,500
" When their days change."

444
00:34:42,505 --> 00:34:46,305
" They will take revenge,
take revenge."

445
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,600
" Of each and everything."

446
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,600
" When their days change."

447
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,733
" When their days change."

448
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:05,200
" Oh! Rama, Rama. Oh! Rama,
Rama. Oh! Rama, Rama."

449
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,900
" Is she a girl or a tornado?"

450
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,500
" She looks at me with
such big eyes."

451
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,700
" Why are you drawing the
arrows from the quiver?"

452
00:35:31,305 --> 00:35:33,605
" She is the daughter of a rich man."

453
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,600
" I show her a match."

454
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:42,100
" Why has she come to this place?"

455
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:48,700
" This Goddess Chandi."

456
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,400
" If you are a tempest."

457
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,400
" Then they are mountains."

458
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,500
" You are taking them for weeds."

459
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,500
" When their days change."

460
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,300
" When their days change."

461
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,300
" They will take revenge,
take revenge."

462
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,600
" Of each and everything."

463
00:36:08,202 --> 00:36:10,502
" When their days change."

464
00:36:11,203 --> 00:36:14,203
" When their days change."

465
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,100
" 1,2,3.
1,2,3. "

466
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:44,500
" Does not know dancing and
the instrument is playing."

467
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:56,400
" The youth is laden with
diamonds and pearls."

468
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,200
" Your face is lovely."

469
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,500
" But the brain is rotten."

470
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:07,700
" The angry cat, scratches the pole."

471
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:13,600
" Understands wrong
and thinks wrong."

472
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,300
" Even if you hiss or bite."

473
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,500
" I am the lover of she- snake."

474
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,200
" I am the lover of she- snake."

475
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,200
" I am the lover of she- snake."

476
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,400
" They will take revenge,
take revenge."

477
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,000
" Of each and everything."

478
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,400
" When their days change."

479
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,100
" When their days change."

480
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,300
" They will take revenge,
take revenge."

481
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,500
" Of each and everything."

482
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:02,500
Oh! God! It is looking like
a slaughter house to me.

483
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,700
What slaughter house?

484
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:07,100
Brother you are a goat and the
girl's father is a butcher.

485
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,500
It seems that death has come 100%.

486
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:14,200
Brother, i request you that you escape
through the narrow lane for few days.

487
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,300
You have put your hand inside
the hole of a snake.

488
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,400
Bantu.
- Yes.

489
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,100
Do not take me as an idiot.

490
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,500
If i know to put my hand inside
the hole of a snake then...

491
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,700
... i also know to play the
instrument to placate it.

492
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,500
Oh! Sohrab Modi, hw will
play your instrument.

493
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:30,500
When the time of death is near
for a Jackal then it runs towards a city.

494
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,000
Dear brother, i touch your
feet and request...

495
00:38:33,024 --> 00:38:35,424
...that you escape from
here for a few days.

496
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:39,500
Oh! God! This Billy- goat has
gone and dashed against the butcher.

497
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:44,600
Please forgive me, sir. JK Sahib,
please forgive me.

498
00:38:45,204 --> 00:38:49,404
Jadhurao, my money
has made you a MLA.

499
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,300
You are right my master.

500
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,400
10 days ago i had told you that
a party from Singapore is...

501
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,300
... bring costly diamonds
for me through sea.

502
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:02,100
So you take out the Police
guard from there.

503
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,300
And today you are telling me
that this can not be done.

504
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:09,200
JK Sahib, an officer from Delhi
is taking rounds here.

505
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,600
He is not from the Police here.

506
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,500
Then telephone Delhi that
JK's material is coming.

507
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:17,200
Mr. JK in this my party
is not the culprit.

508
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,300
Move out of my sight.

509
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,400
Come Chander. Sit down.

510
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:28,300
I am in a strange problem. If
something is not done soon...

511
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,400
... then i'll have to
bear a very big loss.

512
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,300
Wonderful! I've a
wonderful idea sir.

513
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,400
You know that in 1942 when
Gandhiji's revolution was on...

514
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,300
... i used to tie the material on my
waist and swim below the boat.

515
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,500
In the same way i'll
tie all the diamonds to...

516
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,100
... my waist and swim under the boat.

517
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,800
Who will be able to
see me in the water?

518
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:54,300
You fool. You are always
talking about 1942.

519
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:00,400
You think they will not be able
to see such a big boat on the water?

520
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,700
Greetings, sir.

521
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:09,300
He is a film producer. Daddy,
invests his black money in...

522
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,300
... his film and turns
in into white money.

523
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:16,400
Sir, tomorrow morning the
shooting of the film is scheduled.

524
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:20,300
You had said that
you'll arrange for the money...

525
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,700
... and sent.
- Come later.

526
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,500
Sir, the government's
permission has been acquired.

527
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,400
The boat will also
come at the silver beach.

528
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,700
How much do you want?

529
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,700
Sir, for now 50 thousand will do.

530
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,200
We just have to shoot a small scene.

531
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,300
From one boat a masked smugglers
come and bring...

532
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,600
... a briefcase full of Hashish
and cocaine and hand it over...

533
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,200
... to the party which is
standing on the shore.

534
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:49,100
And they go away with the money
in the other briefcase.

535
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,400
I don't want to hear this
rubbish story of yours.

536
00:40:51,503 --> 00:40:53,803
Take 50 thousand from Rakesh
and go away from here.

537
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,000
Right now i am much tensed...

538
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,200
Sir, if i take away
your tension, then?

539
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:07,100
Papa, this is my friend. Chander.
He was with me in the college.

540
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,500
He is a lawyer.

541
00:41:09,501 --> 00:41:13,101
What were you saying, boy?

542
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:17,300
Tomorrow in the film's shooting
all the masked men...

543
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:21,400
... will be your men. Instead
of the shooting boat your...

544
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:25,100
... Singapore boat will be
brought to the shore.

545
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:29,500
The smugglers will alight from
the boat and give the real...

546
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,600
... diamonds to your men in
full view of everyone.

547
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,300
And in return they will take
their money from your...

548
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,700
... men in the other briefcase.

549
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,500
The spectators will think that
it is a film's shooting.

550
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,300
And there is no fear
of the Police also.

551
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:49,000
Brilliant! Brilliant! That's
an excellent idea.

552
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,500
The boy's idea is brilliant.

553
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,200
Papa that is why i have brought
my friend with me.

554
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,200
His brain works at top speed.

555
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,300
Serve you friend whisky.
Entertain him.

556
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,900
From today onwards he
is my special man.

557
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:02,000
Thank you. Thank you very much.

558
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:07,400
Raka, tomorrow you'll wear a
mask and give the briefcase...

559
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,400
... full of money to the Singapore
party and in...

560
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,500
... return you'll take friefcase
full of diamonds...

561
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,100
... and come here straight.
- Ok.

562
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,300
Oh! I've understood the
whole plan, my dear man.

563
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,700
I've understood the entire plan.

564
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:22,500
But tell me who will be
driving the white car?

565
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,300
Kalluram.
- Kalluram.

566
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,500
This is his address.

567
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,700
So this fool is kallu.

568
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:32,000
Brother, you give us all the
information of your master.

569
00:42:32,402 --> 00:42:35,302
But God's man, why are you
deceiving your master?

570
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,700
Yes, why do you do that?

571
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,700
You have asked me this
question many times.

572
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,700
Today, i'll tell you.
I am a CID officer.

573
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:49,100
CID?
- He is joking.

574
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,400
His jokes are quite dirty.

575
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,400
This is not a joke. I had to get
in to JK's gang in order to arrest him.

576
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:57,500
But he is so influential
that i am unable...

577
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,900
... to do anything till now.

578
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:04,300
But dear man, why did you tell
us this secret? - Yes, why?

579
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,200
Because i know that in reality
you are Raju and this is Bantu.

580
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:11,400
And i also know that you loot
these thugs and help the needy.

581
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:13,488
You do not keep
anything with you.

582
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,200
Bakhtavar!
- Yes?

583
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,200
I am reminded of he
plums of Afghanistan.

584
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,500
Come, let us run away.

585
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:22,500
Stop! Do you recognize her?

586
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,500
Oh! This is aunt.

587
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,600
Because of this nice woman
we were able to eat two square meals.

588
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,100
But she was a boot legger.

589
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:38,100
That was just a cover. Actually
she used to pass on...

590
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:39,900
... the information about
the criminals.

591
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,400
But how are you connected with her?

592
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:45,500
I am her son. One day her
secret was out and these...

593
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,000
... dogs killed my mother.

594
00:43:48,475 --> 00:43:52,475
After that the Police looked
after me and made me what i am today.

595
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,600
Ramakant?
- Yes.

596
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,500
My brother.

597
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:04,400
Now you give me the briefcase
containing the 50 hundred...

598
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,500
... thousand rupees and
you keep this with you.

599
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,600
What is inside this?

600
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,300
But with this i'll be
caught straight away.

601
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,700
No, you'll not be caught.
Now drink some water.

602
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:15,200
You unnecessarily take tension
even when i am here.

603
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:21,400
Crazy man. Drink more. Yes.

604
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:25,400
Ok. Now you'll be saved.
- How?

605
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,900
A drug was mixed on this water.

606
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,400
Drug? What kind of drug?

607
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,600
Why are you getting scared?

608
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:34,300
You'll not die. You'll just
be unconscious for some time.

609
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,600
Understood? Now cover your
face with the mask.

610
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,200
And go and take your position.
Hurry up.

611
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,200
Is the boat ready?
- Ready.

612
00:44:43,212 --> 00:44:45,212
Ok. Start camera!

613
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:49,400
Clap in. 4 by 20 take 1.
- Action!

614
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:59,400
Our boss is excellent. Our
diamonds are coming...

615
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,500
... towards us like eggs
and vegetables.

616
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:11,400
It is boss's orders that we have
to keep track of that car.

617
00:45:11,403 --> 00:45:12,803
Hurry up. Sit in the car. Quick.

618
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,900
These people are going
some other way.

619
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,400
I think that something is amiss.

620
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,200
Follow them. Catch them.

621
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,200
What is that commotion?
Stop the vehicle.

622
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,500
Police! Police! Inspector,
good that you've come.

623
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,200
Inspector, they are very
dangerous smugglers.

624
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,200
That white car contains
diamonds worth millions...

625
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,200
... of rupees and this briefcase contains
50 hundred thousand rupees.

626
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,200
Who are you? And why are
you wearing this mask?

627
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,200
If i take off this mask and this bull
sees me then he will kill me later.

628
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,900
Arrest them. - Don't worry.
The Police can not do anything to us.

629
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,000
We are Mr. JK's men.

630
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,800
You go and sit in the jeep.
I'll just come.

631
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,600
Ok. I'll wait for you
on the jeep's bonnet.

632
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,100
Give me the briefcase.

633
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,700
Hmm... Arest them and take
them to the Police Station.

634
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:56,500
Where has that masked man
disappeared. Search for him too.

635
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:06,500
Inspector Ram Singh?
You'll arrest my man?

636
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:12,300
How did you forget that our
hands are longer and...

637
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,300
... stronger than the
hands of the Law.

638
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,600
Every criminal thinks this, JK.

639
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,700
But the result of
every crime is one.

640
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:25,300
And that is criminal's neck in the
grip of the hands of the Law.

641
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,300
Robert, call up SP.

642
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:34,700
SP?

643
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:39,300
One of your foolish Inspector
who is bitten by the bug of...

644
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:46,300
... honesty has some of my men
and material in this custody.

645
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,400
Who is he?

646
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:54,200
Inspector Ram Singh. He is standing
in front of me tied like a mad dog.

647
00:47:54,302 --> 00:48:00,602
Hand over the phone to him.
Please. Hello!

648
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:04,300
Sir, these thugs have beaten
me up very badly. And sir...

649
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:08,500
Shut up! Release all
men of JK Sahib.

650
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:13,600
And also give him back all his
material and then report to me.

651
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:19,400
But sir... - There is also no
need to write the report of...

652
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,400
... this matter. It is my order.
- Sir.

653
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,800
You have prevented me from
committing a murder.

654
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:31,600
But i do not want this
man in my area at all.

655
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:36,400
Sir, i'll get his transfer
orders from top.

656
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,300
You do not worry at all, sir.

657
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:44,800
Robert, go with this Inspector and
bring back all my material and men.

658
00:48:53,301 --> 00:48:55,501
Mr. Chang Lee? How
come you are here?

659
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:59,800
Mr. JK, my boss Chang Kang
send real diamonds...

660
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,300
... according to his promise to you.

661
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:07,400
But in return we got this
from your man instead of...

662
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,700
... so hundred thousand. Old papers.

663
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:23,200
How did this happen? Which bastard
has dared to do this?

664
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:26,400
Bantu!
- Yes.

665
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,300
Give half of this money to Raka.
- Ok.

666
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,500
And keep 5% from the rest for
our expenses. - Correct.

667
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,500
And put rest of the money in
a briefcase and keep it in...

668
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,500
... a locker at the Central Station.
- Ok.

669
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,800
And get the receipt and give
it to me. -Right. - Ok.

670
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,400
Now who has come.

671
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,600
Who is master Raju?

672
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,100
What is it Paltu,
what is the matter?

673
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:13,400
I am Raju. Why?
- Take this.

674
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,700
What is this? Is there any
bomb or something in it?

675
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:18,100
Take it friend. This
is a letter for Raju.

676
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:20,400
Oh! You scoundrel, you
are winking at me.

677
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:25,400
It is a letter. Take this. The
message of your death has...

678
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,800
... come from the girl father.
He must have ask you...

679
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,200
... your last wish. They always
ask before hanging you.

680
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,600
Don't talk nonsense. Let me
see what is written in it.

681
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,600
Oh! God almighty save
us from this problem.

682
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:35,800
Come my Love, my beloved.

683
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:40,400
If you can have lunch with me
tomorrow then i'll think...

684
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:46,300
... that you have forgiven me. I'll
wait for you at the Picnic Spot...

685
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:49,300

00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:59,600
She will at least show some mercy.

690
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,700
She is a girl of high familly.

691
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:04,400
Brother...
- Yes.

692
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,000
Get ready. I think there
is something fishy.

693
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:11,400
I also like fishy things very much.
- Oh! Really?

694
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,700
Come.

695
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,400
Our prey is here. Come. Hurry up.

696
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,700
You called me and i came
running on my motorcycle.

697
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:25,500
Thank you so much. My friends
were very eager to meet you.

698
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,700
What are you saying?

699
00:51:26,703 --> 00:51:28,703
Come on everybody greet him.
- Greetings.

700
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:34,100
Oh! By God! I am feeling that i am in
the court of King of the Gods, Indra.

701
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:38,400
All round me there are fairies.
I don't know how should i thank you.

702
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:40,700
Give me your hand.

703
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:42,400
No. Please do not thank me.

704
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,700
If you want to give me something
then give me forgiveness. - Oh!

705
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,600
Oh! No! You have fallen down.

706
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:52,300
Yes, i fell down but your gesture of
asking for forgiveness was such, right?

707
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:55,400
I am sorry. I am very sorry.I want
to ask for your forgiveness once again.

708
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,600
No please do not ask for
forgiveness again and again.

709
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,900
You know if you ask for forgiveness
again and again...

710
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:01,900
... then yours and mine
waist will get twisted.

711
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:05,400
What?
- Beautiful! Mind blowing!

712
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:09,200
Girls have you seen his costume?

00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:14,100
For the first time in my life
seen such an air- conditioned costume.

714
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:18,200
So what if the clothes are torn.
I have the heart of a king.

715
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:21,400
Wow! How splendid. Very good.

716
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:25,300
Look, these are the windows
of the Royal palace.

717
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:26,800
Like Hawa ( Wind) Mahal.

718
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,600
What is the matter?
You are perspiring?

719
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:31,500
No, it is not that.
- Then?

720
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,000
When the fingers of a young
and beautyful girl like you...

721
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,500
... will move on the chest of
a young and handsome boy's....

722
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:37,900
... chest then won't i perspire?

723
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:42,000
This is the limit of love,
why are you crying?

724
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,500
Keep watching what happens further.

725

Hey do not only feed you food.

But they also help you to digest it.

731
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,000
Oh! I see. It means that along
with the food there are...

732
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:05,500

00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,600
What kind of lunch is this?

737
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,400
I have never eaten this

00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000

Hit him such a punch...

Very good. Keep it up.

764
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:43,500
Oh! Crazy girl, you did
not do this good with me.

765
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,000
You have spoilt a young man's youth.

766
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:48,400
Beat him. Hit him more.

767
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:51,800
Stop! You dogs. You rascals.

768
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,600
Are you all thinking that you
are Mohammed Ali's sons?

769
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,400
Have you ever seen Bruce
Lee's fight? - No.

770
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:03,500

773
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Stop! There was a lady
finger on a tree.

A creeper climbed on it.

775
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,800
Its father had 6 lady fingers
and 6 creepers climbed on it.

776
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:47,100
What is the matter? You are four
buffalo like men and he is alone.

777
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,300
The camel is tall. And its
tail is a little tall.

778
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:51,900
The camel is a little taller and
the tail is also a little taller.

779
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,300
The tall camel's tail is tall.

780
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:58,000
The ant's walk, the insect's walk.

781
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:04,800
Ant's and insect's walk.

782
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:10,400
Come on hit him.

783
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,400
The chameleon jumped.
The chameleon jumped.

784
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:15,600
I'll give you all 50 thousand.

785
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,000
We don't want your 50 thousand.

786
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,400
We do not want to lose our lived.

787
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,800
Run brothers, run from here.

788
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:28,600
What?
- What... - What?

789
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,400
Your punching men have run away.

790
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:33,400
Now who will serve me lunch?

791
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,500
How do i know?

792
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:38,400
You yourself invite me to lunch
and then you are showing me your thumb?

793
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,700
Come on. Feed me.

794
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,100
Behave yourself, you misbehaved
man. - What?

795
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
You can see the difference
in you and me?

796
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:47,200
Yes. I can see that.

797
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:50,400
The guest wears open and
air- conditioned clothes.

798
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
And the hostess is standing
in simple clothes?

799
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:55,100
It is not justified.

800
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:58,600
" For this day and that day."

801
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:01,500
" For this day and that day."

802
00:57:02,406 --> 00:57:05,006
" I will take revenge, take revenge."

803
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:07,500
" Of each and everything."

804
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:15,900
Now serve me lunch in a plate. Food.

805
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,200
I am not somebody's servant.

806
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,300
I do not know all this.

807
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:23,300
You know to hit the poor people
with your shoes in the crowded market.

808
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
You know to get me
bashed up by thugs.

809
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,000
And the work which a girl should
know, you don't know that?

810
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:32,400
I'll teach you. Lunch!

811
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
The food was good. This
desert... . This one.

812
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:02,400
I'll eat it some other day.

813
00:58:07,601 --> 00:58:10,001
Oh! My God! What a macho man.
- Yes.

814
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:12,500
Oh! Shut up. I'll
not keep him alive.

815
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,100
I am dead. Help.

816
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:32,400
Bastard, i'll kill you.

817
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,900
Master, please save me.
She will kill me.

818
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:37,600
You fool. Are you blind?

819
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,000
What is the matter, daughter?
How did your clothes tear?

820
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,300
Nothing!
- Mini! Mini, child!

821
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:46,000
Mini. - Mini!
What has happened to her.

822
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,200
What has happened to her?

823
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,200
How would i know dad.
I'll go and ask her.

824
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,400
Stop.

825
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:53,500
She is your...?

826
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,900
She is my daughter, Mini.
Seems that she has...

827
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,600
... fought with some friend of hers.

828
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,300
She is very hot tempered.

829
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Ma! Asha!
- Brother Suraj has come.

830
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:10,400
Asha, how are you?

831
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:13,500
Mother!

00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:15,500
Greetings, Ma.

833
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:17,500
Why are you just greeting
her? Touch her feet.

834
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,600
And why are you just standing
here and looking?

835
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:22,900
Go and get sweets for brother
Suraj. Go. Get water too.

836
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:24,400
I am just coming.

837
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:31,000
Brother Suraj has become an
Inspector and brother...

838
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,500
... Chander has become a Lawyer.

839
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:34,700
Mother, it such a happy thing.

00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:37,000
Yes son.

Ok. Everybody clap. You all

00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,600
... this plate. Yes, why not.

844

For the last twenty years i have
been searching jungle but you.

845
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,700
But forget about Gold. There
was not even a trace of it.

846
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:14,400
Tell me where you have
hidden the gold.

847
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:17,200
You have scratched away
my skin with your hunter.

848
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:20,700
You even subjected me to electric
shock and drained my blood.

849
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:25,200
I have not opened my mouth
until now then why would i do so now.

850
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,000
This is your father's blood
which is staining this hand kerchief.

851
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
It has been
waiting all these years...

852
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,700
... for his sons to grow up
and avenge his murder.

853
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,600
Sir, this is Inspector Suraj.

854
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:48,700
I have appointed him in place
of Inspector Ram Singh.

855
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,300
I have posted him in your area.

856
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:54,700
Ok. Have you told him
everything about me?

857
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:56,200
Yes. sir. SP has told me everything.

858
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,800
I have to wear the uniform of
the Government but serve you.

859
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:02,600
Alright. I never keep
my dogs hungry.

860
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:05,800
I keep them fat by feeding
them fresh meat and butter.

861
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,100
SP!
- Yes sir.

862
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,000
The diamonds which Inspector
Ram Singh had apprehended...

863
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:15,600
... i have got them. But i have
still not got my money back.

864
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:21,400
Neither have we found any clue
about that thief who had stolen it.

865
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:25,000
Sir, i have got the complete
report of this matter from Mr. SP.

866
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:29,100
I promise you that
very soon i'll catch that...

867
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:30,700
... thug and throw him in your feet.

868
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:34,000
Just once you catch that enemy
of mine and bring him here.

869
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,000
I'll give him such
a punishment that even...

870
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,600
... this earth will shiver with fear.

871
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:45,000
I'll kill his parents, brothers
sisters, wife and children.

872
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,200
I'll kill each one
of them one by one.

873
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:51,300
" When their days will change."

874
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:54,300
" When their days will change."

875
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:00,000
" They will take revenge,
take revenge."

876
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
" For each and everything."

877
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,000
" When their days will change."

878
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
" When their days will change."

879
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:12,000
" They will take revenge,
take revenge."

880
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,300
" For each and everything."

881
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:22,000
The Prime Minister has declared
that his government...

882
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,900
... will take strict steps against
corruption, accumulators...

883
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,400
... and profit makers.

884
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,000
150 kilometers away from Mumbai
city at Kasara Ghat...

885
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,100
... some school children were playing.

886
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,000
While playing one of the children
pushed one of his mates.

887
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,400
The boy fell down in
the water fall and he died.

888
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,400
His dead body was
found the next day.

889
01:02:48,305 --> 01:02:51,005
Raju, now you can not
get away from me.

890
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,200
I have your death
written in my hand.

891
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,800
Waterfall... Kasara Ghat...

892
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:15,200
My God, you are unrecognizable.

893
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,400
How am i looking?
- Handsome.

894
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:22,000
You are looking exactly
like a real prince.

895
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,300
Thank you. Thank you very much.

896
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:29,100
By the way clothes are
deceptive, madam.

897
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:32,700
If inside these clothes if there is
a thief, thug or a hoodlum then?

898
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:35,000
I am not afraid of thugs and
hooligans. - Not afraid?

899
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Ok. Now tell me why have you
called me 150 kilometers...

900
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,000
... away from the city in
this lonely jungle.

901
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Have you arranged for
my lunch today also?

902
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Raju, you don't know how
much you have changed me.

903
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:48,000
I've changed you? Me? You?

904
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Yes, you. I have seen many
men who kneel down in front of me.

905
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,000
But for the first time i have
seen a man who could make...

906
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
... a girl like me kneel
down in his feet.

907
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,300
I know.

908
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:06,000
I think that you don't know that
a girl gets real happiness...

909
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,000
... by not making a man bow
down in front of her but...

910
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:10,700
... by bowing down in front of him.

911
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:13,600
I know. I know everything.
Can i ask you something?

912
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:14,800
Yes, ask me.

913
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,900
The other day when you reached
home in torn clothes...

914
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:21,400
... then your family members did not ask
you anything seeing you in that condition?

915
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:25,500
Yes. My brother had asked me that
who has done this to you?

916
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:29,400
I'll cu him into pieces. You
just tell me his name.

917
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,700
Then did you tell him my name?
- No.

918
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:39,500
Why?
- You want to know?

919
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:45,700
Take out your shoes.
- Shoes? Ok.

920
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:49,700
Take off your Jacket.
- Why?

921
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:51,500
You just take it off.
- Ok.

922
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:54,100
Here.
- Good.

923
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:55,300
Now take off your shirt.

924
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:58,700
I should take off the shirt too.

925
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:04,000
Now take off the pants too.

926
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,100
Pants? No! What are you saying?
In front of a girl?

927
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:07,500
No i feel shy.

928
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:10,100
You'll not take them off like this.
- No. No. No.

929
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:16,500
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

930
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:57,600
" Your liveliness has enticed me."

931
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:01,700
" Your manliness has enticed me."

932
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:05,400
" I've lost my heart,
i have lost it."

933
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:09,500
" I've lost my heart,
i have lost it."

934
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:13,400
" Your liveliness has enticed me."

935
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:17,600
" Your manliness has enticed me."

936
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,700
" Except you no one is my beloved."

937
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:48,400
" I saw your face and fell for it."

938
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:57,000
" When i met you i changed."

939
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:02,000
" I saw your face and fell for it."

940
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:06,000
" When i met you i changed."

941
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:10,000
" I saw your face and fell for it."

942
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:13,500
" When i met you i changed."

943
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:17,400
" My entire haughtiness went waste."

944
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:21,600
" Your manliness has enticed me."

945
01:07:21,601 --> 01:07:25,401
" I've lost my heart,
i have lost it."

946
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:29,500
" I've lost my heart,
i have lost it."

947
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:33,500
" Your liveliness has enticed me."

948
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:38,200
" Your manliness has enticed me."

949
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:09,600
" Take me in your arms."

950
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:18,300
" I am thirsty and burning in... "

951
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:26,400
" Take me in your arms."

952
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:43,100
" This season of youth is... "

953
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:46,700
" This heart is asking
for your hand."

954
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:54,600
" This heart is asking
for your hand."

955
01:08:56,500 --> 01:09:01,000
" You've filled every pore
of my body with fire."

956
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,400
" You have enticed me. "

957
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:09,000
" You've filled every pore
of my body with fire."

958
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,300
" You have enticed me. "

959
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:15,200
" I am lost in this world."

960
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:19,400
" Your manliness has enticed me."

961
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:23,100
" I've lost my heart,
i have lost it."

962
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:27,300
" I've lost my heart,
i have lost it."

963
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:31,200
" Your liveliness has enticed me."

964
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:35,500
" Your manliness has enticed me."

965
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:39,200
" I've lost my heart,
i have lost it."

966
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:43,400
" I've lost my heart,
i have lost it."

967
01:09:58,600 --> 01:09:59,700
Mini!

968
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:33,600
I... Here... How?

969
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:37,000
You had slipped and fell
down the waterfall.

970
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,000
I also jumped in to save you.
With great difficulty i could...

971
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,600
... save you and brought you here.

972
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:48,600
Now how are you feeling?

973
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:55,600
I am fine.

974
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:29,300
You have taken off
all my wet clothes?

975
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:32,000
Yes, i've taken them off myself.
There was no...

976
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,800
... other option than
this to save you.

977
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:40,000
You were shivering very badly.
And you were also...

978
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,600
... having difficulty in breathing.

979
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:45,000
So the entire night i laid you
down besides this fire...

980
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,700
... to give your body some heat.

981
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:51,000
And after that i put these dry
clothes on you and prayed...

982
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,400
... to to God for your well being.

983
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:58,000
Thank God that now you are fine.

984
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:04,000
You please do not misunderstand me.

985
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:08,100
You are still the same as you were.

986
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:19,300
No Raju, i am not the same
as i was any more.

987
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:21,700
What is this that you are saying?

988
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:31,000
My mother is like God to me.
And i swear by her that...

989
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,400
... you are still as pure as Ganges.

990
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:37,200
Please do not cry like this
and make me a sinner.

991
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:44,600
These tears are of repentance, Raju.

992
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:51,400
If i am alive today it
is only because of you.

993
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:58,400
Now this life belongs to you.

994
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:01,300
Mine?
- Yes.

995
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:15,400
No. No!
- Raju!

996
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:21,000
Daughter where were
you the entire night.

997
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,400
Papa, i was with a friend
of mine in a party.

998
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:26,200
If you were at a party then
you should have telephone me.

999
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,000
And what is this wound?

1000
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:30,600
Have you fought with somebody
today and come?

1001
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:33,600
Sorry Papa.

1002
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:45,200
Boss, as you ordered,
the Inspector is here.

1003
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:47,300
Send him in.
- Inspector!

1004
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:54,100
Robert, you go out.

1005
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:58,000
Inspector, i had mentioned to
you that there is a thug who...

1006
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,500
... steals my material again and
again and takes it away.

1007
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:01,700
I remember sir.

1008
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:03,400
I have made a plan to catch him.

1009
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:07,600
Today at sharp 2 o clock in the afternoon
i am sending a truck to Khandala.

1010
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,500
Raka is driving that truck.

1011
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:15,300
I've told Raka that the truck is
carrying 4 boxes with gold in them.

1012
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Ranjit will follow that truck.

1013
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,300
But Raka does not know this.

1014
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:25,600
Whoever will try to come near that
truck, Ranjit will shoot his photograph.

1015
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:31,000
And as soon as the truck
reaches Khandala Ghat,...

1016
01:15:31,100 --> 01:15:32,400
... you'll stop it and check it.

1017
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,100
Have you understood.

1018
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:37,000
You don't worry sir. If this time
that thief comes then he will...

1019
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:40,200
... not be able to slip
out of my hands.

1020
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:55,400
Stop the truck. I am telling
you to stop the truck.

1021
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:57,300
Oh! No! From where has
the Police come?

1022
01:15:57,700 --> 01:16:00,500
I told you stop. I am telling
you to stop or i'll...

1023
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:06,000
Oh! Greetings Ramakanth,
how are you?

1024
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:07,500
You have not recognized us?

1025
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:12,500
Brother, i did not recognize
you in this new disguise.

1026
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:13,800
This is wonderful.

1027
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,000
You know whenever we have
to support some helpless...

1028
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,100
... being or a friend or if we have
to face a criminal then...

1029
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:24,200
... we take this kind of disguise.
Right Bantu. - Right.

1030
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:37,000
Brother, this time there are
four boxes among these...

1031
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
... boxes which are filled with gold.

1032
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:43,300
Four boxes full of gold?
But which are they?

1033
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:47,300
That i also don't know. Now you
take care of it. I am going.

1034
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:50,100
Greetings Ramakant, greetings.

1035
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:52,500
Boss, this is Ranjit speaking.

1036
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:53,700
Yes, Ranjit tell me.

1037
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:57,300
Raka has himself handed over
the truck full of goods to the Police.

1038
01:16:58,100 --> 01:16:59,500
Have you taken his pictures?

1039
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:02,000
Yes, Boss. Both the Policemen
are Sardars.

1040
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,600
You come with the photographs to me.

1041
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,400
I'll take care of the rest.
- Ok.

1042
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:18,000
We have take hold of a treasure...

1043
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,100
What's the matter?

1044
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:20,300
Police jeep is coming.

1045
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:21,500
That is JK Sahib's truck.

1046
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:23,100
Stop the vehicle. And
you all get ready.

1047
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:24,600
Oh! Bantu that is brother Suraj.

1048
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:25,700
Run! Run!

1049
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,700
Hands up!

1050
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:33,700
Halt! - Greetings brother. Please
forgive us, we have commited a mistake.

1051
01:17:33,700 --> 01:17:36,000
We are the king and
you are the subject.

1052
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,500
What do you mean?
- I mean, take 2 thousand rupees...

1053
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:39,600
... and let us go.

1054
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:40,700
Shut up! Who is that?

1055
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,000
He is the cleaner. I am
the owner of this truck.

1056
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,100
It is not his mistake. He
is go a new boy. You can go.

1057
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,600
Turn around. Turn.

1058
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:03,000
I'll shoot. Inspector, tell your
men to give their guns to my boss.

1059
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:07,600
Otherwise a lot
of blood will be shed. Yes.

1060
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:08,800
Put the guns down.

1061
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:12,000
Master!
- Yes.

1062
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,400
Pick up their guns and put
them in water. - Ok.

1063
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:16,000
You go.
- Ok.

1064
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,200
I'll come just now.

1065
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:20,000
Very good. Brothers, do not move.

1066
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:21,200
Or he will shoot.

1067
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:22,600
God help them.

1068
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:26,100
I am telling you, don't
move. Don't move.

1069
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,300
Leave me. I will hit you.

1070
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:20,300
Raju, you?

1071
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,600
If JK comes to know of it, then
along with Raju we also will die.

1072
01:19:27,601 --> 01:19:29,901
He is a smuggler,
a thief and a thug.

1073
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Why don't you say anything?

1074
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,500
Why have you locket your mouth?

1075
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:37,400
Why are you allowing him
to blacken your face?

1076
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:40,600
Put your hand on my head and say
that everything is untrue.

1077
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:48,800
How can i tell a lie after
keeping my hand on your head, ma?

1078
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:03,500
Please forgive me, Ma.

1079
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:06,500
Since when are you doing this?

1080
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,200
Since childhood.

1081
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:14,000
Now you have heard
it with your ears?

1082
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,500
Or is there anything else to hear?

1083
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:20,400
If the other people come to know
of this then our name will be soiled.

1084
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:22,800
After all i am a respected lawyer.

1085
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:25,100
I am a Police Inspector.

1086
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:27,300
If i stay with him then
i'll lose my job.

1087
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:29,800
That is why we used to tell
you not to give him much...

1088
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:32,000
... importance. The
scum grows on scum.

1089
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,200
Come on.

1090
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:35,200
Where are you going, ma?
Where are you going?

1091
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:36,600
No, ma. Please forgive me. Ma.

1092
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:39,300
Please forgive me. Keep this down.

1093
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:40,600
Asha, why don't you tell, Ma.

1094
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:43,000
You tell Ma. Why are
you not tell her.

1095
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:44,700
Ma, what are you doing?

1096
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:47,000
This house is not pure
anymore for the God.

1097
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:48,300
Come Asha.

1098
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:51,000
Ma, i apologies. Asha i apoligies.
Brother Chander...

1099
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,100
... i ask for forgiveness.

1100
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:55,000
You all can not leave
me like this and go.

1101
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Ma. Ma, i touch your feet. I'll
be left alone in the world.

1102
01:20:59,100 --> 01:21:03,000
You drank my milk but still
you etched on my forehead...

1103
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,200
... that her son is a thief.

1104
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:07,600
Shameless, at least you could have
saved the grace of my milk.

1105
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:10,300
Ma, i touch you feet. Ma!

1106
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:13,500
Asha. Ma, i am your son, Ma.

1107
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:16,000
You are my mother,
my father and God.

1108
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,500
You are everything to me, ma. Ma!

1109
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:19,000
Move back! Brother Chander!

1110
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:22,400
Ma, do not leave me and go.

1111
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:23,600
I am not your mother.

1112
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:24,700
Come on, driver.

1113
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:27,200
Taxi driver do not start the
engine otherwise i'll bash...

1114
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:28,800
... you up. Ma, i'll not
let the taxi go.

1115
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:31,300
If you'll stop me again then
you'll see my dead face.

1116
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:38,200
He escaped? How did he escape?

1117
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:41,700
How did my prey escape after
coming into your hands?

1118
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:47,200
What punishment should i give
you for this carelessness of yours?

1119
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:49,700
You have faith in me sir, one
day i'll definitely catch him.

1120
01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:50,900
I'll catch him. Get out!

1121
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:03,300
Look at this photograph
of yours, you rascal.

1122
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:07,400
But sir, these are Policeman.

1123
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:10,000
And i don't even know them.

1124
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,300
And then what could i've done in
front of the Police?

1125
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:17,000
You take me for a
fool, rascal. Take him.

1126
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,300
And beat him till he gives you
the names of his friends.

1127
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:23,300
Take him.

1128
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:37,200
Oh! He has not even switched
on the lights.

1129
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,600
Raju, come eat.

1130
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:52,500
You have not eaten anything
since the morning.

1131
01:23:20,700 --> 01:23:22,400
Mother, eat food.

1132
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:24,700
I am not hungry.

1133
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:30,700
You are right.

1134
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:34,800
Because you know that even brother
Raju must not have eaten.

1135
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:36,900
Do not take that thief's
name in front of me.

1136
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:40,500
Ok. Brother Raju is a thief.

1137
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:43,400
But just think, why did
he become a thief?

1138
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:45,700
Was it for himself? No.

1139
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:49,600
Only for us. He could not bear
to see our poverty and our hunger.

1140
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:51,600
So he became a thief.

1141
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:55,000
He have us silk clothes to wear
and he himself wore...

1142
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,200
... old and torn clothes.

1143
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:00,300
In order to give us education and...

1144
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:03,000
... make us something in life he gave
his entire life, mother.

1145
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:06,200
Whatever we are today
it is all because of him.

1146
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:10,400
And today when we have become big
we are seeing the slate in his neck...

1147
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:12,400
... on which the thief is written.

1148
01:24:13,100 --> 01:24:15,600
And we left him alone and said all
kinds of things to him.

1149
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:20,100
If this is not injustice then what
is called injustice, mother?

1150
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:26,800
You are right daughter.

1151
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:31,400
After hearing that Raju is a thief...

1152
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:37,400
... i got such a shock.
I was so hurt...

1153
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:41,200
... that in my anger i forgot why...

1154
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,600
... he did all this.

1155
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:46,900
Come. Let us go back, Mother.

1156
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:53,100
Now with what face will i go back?

1157
01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:57,700
I am not fit for showing
him my face also.

1158
01:24:58,703 --> 01:25:02,103
No. I will no go in front of him.

1159
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,200
I'll not go in front of him.

1160
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:30,000
" You are my mother Yashodha."

1161
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:33,000
" I am your Govinda."

1162
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:39,000
" You are my mother Yashodha."

1163
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:42,000
" I am your Govinda."

1164
01:25:43,609 --> 01:25:48,409
" The son and the mother
see each other's... "

1165
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:52,800
" The son and the mother
see each other's... "

1166
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:57,300
" Face and live."

1167
01:25:57,300 --> 01:26:01,600
" You are my mother Yashodha."

1168
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:04,600
" I am your Govinda."

1169
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:25,300
" When you have the feet of mother...

1170
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:30,200
... then who would desire heaven."

1171
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:34,500
" When you have live God
in front of you...

1172
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:39,200
... then who would worship a stone."

1173
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:46,200
" She nurtures her children
like flowers."

1174
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:50,800
" Herself she sleeps on
the bed of thorns."

1175
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:55,700
" Why would i talk about
human beings?

1176
01:26:56,502 --> 01:27:00,402
" Mother is the creator
of Incarnations. "

1177
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:07,300
" In front of favours of mother."

1178
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:12,000
" In front of favours of mother..."

1179
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:16,500
" Even God will be ashamed."

1180
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:21,000
" You are my mother Yashodha."

1181
01:27:21,100 --> 01:27:24,000
" I am your Govinda."

1182
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:48,700
" She gets pleasure in her
child's happiness."

1183
01:27:49,300 --> 01:27:53,500
" She cries if her child is unhappy."

1184
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:57,900
" The son might be bad."

1185
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:02,000
" But a mother is never bad."

1186
01:28:05,300 --> 01:28:09,700
" When mother is around
i don't know why."

1187
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:14,300
" We never think of this."

1188
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:19,000
" There is no other word
like affection."

1189
01:28:19,100 --> 01:28:24,000
" And there is no one
else like mother."

1190
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:31,000
" Even the most cruel..."

1191
01:28:31,100 --> 01:28:35,400
" Even the most cruel
in this world..."

1192
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:40,000
" Do not criticize their mother."

1193
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:44,400
" You are my mother Yashodha."

1194
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:47,400
" I am your Govinda."

1195
01:28:49,202 --> 01:28:53,302
" You are my mother Yashodha."

1196
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:56,400
" I am your Govinda."

1197
01:28:58,300 --> 01:29:02,300
" The son and the mother
see each other's... "

1198
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:07,100
" The son and the mother
see each other's... "

1199
01:29:07,100 --> 01:29:11,600
" Face and live."

1200
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:16,200
" You are my mother Yashodha."

1201
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:19,200
" I am your Govinda."

1202
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:42,600
Ma, i join my hands in front of you.

1203
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:45,100
I touch your feet; i'll never do
this kind of wrong thing.

1204
01:29:45,100 --> 01:29:47,300
Yes, Ma. Yes.

1205
01:29:47,300 --> 01:29:49,600
He is telling lies, Ma.
Brother Chander! Ma! Ma!

1206
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:54,300
Raju! - Ma! Ma! I swear by you, ma.
I have left everything.

1207
01:29:54,300 --> 01:29:55,600
I am telling you the truth, ma.

1208
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:58,200
Ma, this thug has been deceiving
us like this always.

1209
01:29:58,300 --> 01:30:00,600
Now you get lost. - Listen to me,
brother Suraj!

1210
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:02,000
I say you get lost from here. - Ma!

1211
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,300
At least let him come inside.

1212
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:07,000
Ma, if he comes inside then either
we all will be locked...

1213
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:09,700
... up in the jail or be
killed by the criminals.

1214
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,200
Come on, Ma. - Raju! - Ma!

1215
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:12,600
Come on, Ma.

1216
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:14,400
Brother Chander!

1217
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,200
Raju! - Ma! Ma!

1218
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:37,700
Raju, it is fine that for them you
only looted criminals and thugs.

1219
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
But even after making their
life comfortable...

1220
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:42,700
... why did you keep doing all this?

1221
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:47,900
This is a very big secret.

1222
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:50,800
You want to know it?

1223
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,300
Then come with me.

1224
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:55,400
Greetings Mother.

1225
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:58,600
Oh Raju, come, come. Sit.

1226
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,200
Just a minute.

1227
01:31:09,403 --> 01:31:11,103
Yes Raju, look.

1228
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:15,000
Once again someone has sent
us a secret donation.

1229
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:19,400
So much money?

1230
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:21,700
Who sends this?

1231
01:31:21,900 --> 01:31:23,100
God knows.

1232
01:31:23,100 --> 01:31:24,500
Must be some crazy guy.

1233
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:28,500
We get an unsigned letter and
a receipt of the cloakroom.

1234
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:30,600
When we go there, we get this.

1235
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:40,700
What do you do with so much money?

1236
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:43,400
Raju, you take and show her.

1237
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:44,600
Come, Mini.

1238
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,200
How are you aunty?

1239
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:53,900
Raju! Ever since you got
my eye operated, i've...

1240
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,400
... begun to see a little.

1241
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,400
May God give you in abundance.

1242
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:01,300
I have no one in this world son.

1243
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:03,200
I have four sons.

1244
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:07,400
They live in England and
America with their wives and kids.

1245
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:09,700
They have left me alone.

1246
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:12,200
Absolutely helpless.

1247
01:32:14,900 --> 01:32:16,400
My father couldn't give dowry.

1248
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:20,300
So my mother- in- law and
husband poured oil and burnt me.

1249
01:32:20,900 --> 01:32:22,600
My fate saved me.

1250
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:26,000
My husband was an alcoholic.

1251
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:29,600
He used to make me do dirty
things and used to beat me.

1252
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:33,100
Whether he is a sinner or a prophet.

1253
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,400
A killer or a demi-God.

1254
01:32:36,900 --> 01:32:38,900
A woman comes in everybody's life...

1255
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,500
... as mother, sister
daughter and wife.

1256
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:47,400
Giving him everything, she goes
away from this world quietly.

1257
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:50,400
And what does she get
in return for all that?

1258
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:54,200
Tears, hadred, atrocities, ruin?

1259
01:32:57,100 --> 01:32:59,000
Whatever i stole from this world...

1260
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:02,600
... i showered it on these
helpless, sad women.

1261
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:15,200
Raju, may i get you as a
husband in every incarnation.

1262
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:23,400
No, no! Leave me!

1263
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:26,500
Leave me! Leave me!

1264
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:28,600
Leave me!

1265
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:34,200
Look Raka! You are drenched
in petrol from top to bottom.

1266
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:37,300
I am asking you for the last time.

1267
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:41,200
Tell me about your men.

1268
01:33:42,100 --> 01:33:43,400
I don't have any men.

1269
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:45,300
I don't let traitors live.

1270
01:33:49,300 --> 01:33:50,300
No!

1271
01:33:51,900 --> 01:33:54,600
Go home and inform Dad, that
the work has been completed.

1272
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:59,300
I will wait here and take
this bastard's ashed, go!

1273
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:05,500
What did you say?

1274
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:06,700
Burnt him alive?

1275
01:34:06,900 --> 01:34:09,000
Yes sir. You come quickly with me.

1276
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,400
He must still be burning.

1277
01:34:11,300 --> 01:34:12,400
He's burnt!

1278
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:14,600
Ram's name is the truth...

1279
01:34:14,700 --> 01:34:16,000
Bloody Raka...

1280
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:20,600
Arrest him.

1281
01:34:21,900 --> 01:34:23,300
Shoot him if he runs.

1282
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:25,400
Leave me!
- Shut up!

1283
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:26,700
I said leave me you bastard!

1284
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:39,600
The judge in whose court this case
has gone is a very strict man.

1285
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:45,600
I tried a lot to bribe the judge.

1286
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:48,300
But he's a new judge.

1287
01:34:48,300 --> 01:34:50,000
Can't get my hands on him.

1288
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,000
The Chief Minister is not ready
to listen to anything.

1289
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:56,800
All the Press people are asking for
police protection for the witness.

1290
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:07,600
Mr. KK, what if i get Rakesh
out like hair from butter?

1291
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Great son! At least
one guy has spoken!

1292
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,500
Do you know in 1942, when there
was a case against me...

1293
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:15,300
Shut up!

1294
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:18,700
Otherwise i will strangle
and kill you right here.

1295
01:35:19,100 --> 01:35:21,100
You keep talking rubbish
all the time!

1296
01:35:25,300 --> 01:35:31,400
Chander, if you save Rakesh,
i will load you with wealth.

1297
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:34,200
I will give you whatever
you ask for.

1298
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:39,900
All the Press people have asked
for police protection...

1299
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:41,600
... for the witness haven't they?

1300
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:43,600
Yes.

1301
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:47,300
So you get him the protection
of my brother Suraj.

1302
01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:50,100
Leave the rest to me.

1303
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:52,800
Okay.

1304
01:35:58,400 --> 01:35:59,500
Leave me.

1305
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:01,000
Leave me inspector, leave me.

1306
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:04,300
Suraj, look after him very nicely.

1307
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:07,900
Yes. And with the smoke
from red chillies...

1308
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:12,000
... a person's memory
becomes even better.

1309
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,200
He is unconscious!

1310
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:25,800
Constable, get him back
to consciousness.

1311
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:30,100
And tying him to a chair, giving
him a tremendous electric shock.

1312
01:36:30,100 --> 01:36:33,300
Yes sir. - So Mr. Pandey,
what did you see that day?

1313
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:36,100
When? Which day? Where?

1314
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:39,000
I didn't see anything, sir.

1315
01:36:39,900 --> 01:36:41,700
They brought me here just like that.

1316
01:36:43,300 --> 01:36:45,100
But you have given a statement
to the police.

1317
01:36:45,100 --> 01:36:47,000
Statement? What statement?

1318
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,600
That statement is false.

1319
01:36:49,300 --> 01:36:50,700
I have been forced to write it.

1320
01:36:51,500 --> 01:36:54,300
I can't even see properly
without glasses.

1321
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:58,400
And my glasses have been
broken since the last two months.

1322
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:01,000
You too are appearing
very foggy to me.

1323
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,400
Are you changing your statement
because of fear of someone?

1324
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:04,700
Have the police beaten you up?

1325
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:07,600
No, no sir.

1326
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:09,100
The police have been
very hospitable.

1327
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,700
These are very decent people.

1328
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:15,600
This is a false case My Lord.

1329
01:37:15,628 --> 01:37:19,200
My client Rakesh is the honorable
son of an honorable man.

1330
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
He doesn't know how
to commit a crime.

1331
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Does the public prosecutor
have any other...

1332
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,400
... eye witness? Or some evidence?

1333
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:27,400
Has any one else this
murder taking place?

1334
01:37:30,500 --> 01:37:31,600
No my Lord.

1335
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:34,800
Case is dismissed.

1336
01:37:34,900 --> 01:37:36,000
Bull's eye!

1337
01:37:36,900 --> 01:37:39,400
I won't leave you inspector!

1338
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:44,000
Ladies and Gentlemen!

1339
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:48,000
When great lawyers had
become helpless...

1340
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
... this young man came
forward and took up...

1341
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,700
... the responsibility and saved
my son Rakesh from the gallows.

1342
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:57,400
No matter how much you praise
his intelligence it is not enough.

1343
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:02,000
I am presenting this young
man one of my bungalows...

1344
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,400
... and a check for Rs. 5 lakhs.

1345
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,200
These are its papers.
- Congratulations!

1346
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:09,600
Take this mother.

1347
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:14,700
I too have a share in brother's
victory, mother.

1348
01:38:16,900 --> 01:38:20,000
Sons, you have proved
that even with truth...

1349
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:23,200
... hard work and honesty,
people can become wealthy.

1350
01:38:24,100 --> 01:38:26,100
I am proud to give given you birth.

1351
01:38:26,900 --> 01:38:31,000
Ladies and Gentlemen! On
this happy occasion...

1352
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:32,700
... i want to give you a big surprise.

1353
01:38:33,100 --> 01:38:35,500
This is a surprise which you
can't even think about.

1354
01:38:36,900 --> 01:38:42,000
I have decided to give my dear
daughter's hand to a young man.

1355
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,700
And that young man is Chander.

1356
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:47,500
Congratulations!

1357
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:03,200
" A night of wishes..."

1358
01:39:04,100 --> 01:39:06,700
" All i wish is you remember it..."

1359
01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:12,500
" A night of wishes..."

1360
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:16,600
" All i wish is you remember it..."

1361
01:39:18,100 --> 01:39:22,900
" Go, may the world of
your happiness..."

1362
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,600
" Remain laden..."

1363
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:29,900
" Go, may the world of
your happiness..."

1364
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,600
" Remain laden..."

1365
01:39:51,100 --> 01:39:55,200
" What gift can i give you..."

1366
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:00,100
" My crazy heart sings..."

1367
01:40:05,300 --> 01:40:09,500
" What gift can i give you..."

1368
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:14,200
" My crazy heart sings..."

1369
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:19,000
" May God's grace alwais
be with you..."

1370
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:23,700
" May the treasury of happiness
never be empty..."

1371
01:40:24,200 --> 01:40:28,600
" May the treasury of happiness
never be empty..."

1372
01:40:28,700 --> 01:40:32,200
"Taking the smile of flowers..."

1373
01:40:33,900 --> 01:40:37,100
" May you always remember..."

1374
01:40:38,500 --> 01:40:42,600
" A night of wishes..."

1375
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:46,500
" All i wish is you remember it..."

1376
01:40:48,100 --> 01:40:53,000
" Go, may the world of
your happiness..."

1377
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:54,300
" Remain laden..."

1378
01:40:54,300 --> 01:40:59,900
" Go, may the world of
your happiness... "

1379
01:40:59,900 --> 01:41:01,700
" Remain laden..."

1380
01:41:40,300 --> 01:41:44,500
" I will surrender my life to you..."

1381
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:49,500
" I will fulfill your every wish..."

1382
01:41:54,600 --> 01:41:58,967
" I will surrender my life to you..."

1383
01:41:59,900 --> 01:42:03,900
" I will fulfill your every wish..."

1384
01:42:04,900 --> 01:42:10,900
" Today if you ask for my life..."

1385
01:42:10,900 --> 01:42:13,100
" I will say yes..."

1386
01:42:13,900 --> 01:42:18,100
" I will say yes..."

1387
01:42:19,100 --> 01:42:22,000
" But i pray that i..."

1388
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:26,300
"... remember you..."

1389
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:31,900
" But i pray that i..."

1390
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:36,000
" ... remember you..."

1391
01:42:37,200 --> 01:42:41,900
" Go, may the world of our wishes..."

1392
01:42:41,900 --> 01:42:44,100
"Remain laden..."

1393
01:42:44,900 --> 01:42:50,000
" Go, may the world of our wishes..."

1394
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:51,400
" Remain laden..."

1395
01:43:19,400 --> 01:43:24,000
" We will break every
wall and meet..."

1396
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:28,400
" Not once but a 100 times,
we'll meet... "

1397
01:43:33,900 --> 01:43:38,000
" We will break every
wall and meet..."

1398
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:42,500
" Not once but a 100 times,
we'll meet... "

1399
01:43:42,500 --> 01:43:47,000
" We  met on this side of life..."

1400
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:52,300
" We'll met on this side of life..."

1401
01:43:53,200 --> 01:43:56,700
" We'll meet on that side of life..."

1402
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:02,000
" May the world, for centuries..."

1403
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:05,500
" Remember people in love..."

1404
01:44:06,900 --> 01:44:11,000
" May the world, for centuries..."

1405
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:15,300
" Remember people in love..."

1406
01:44:16,300 --> 01:44:20,000
" May the world of our love..."

1407
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:23,000
" Remain laden..."

1408
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:26,900
" May the world of our love..."

1409
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:30,000
" Remain laden..."

1410
01:44:30,100 --> 01:44:32,900
" May the world of our love..."

1411
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:36,000
" Remain laden..."

1412
01:44:48,100 --> 01:44:50,700
Mother, this is Mini and i...

1413
01:44:53,100 --> 01:44:57,000
Son, i don't know what is happening.

1414
01:44:58,500 --> 01:45:02,000
Mother, if i get married
then it will be to him.

1415
01:45:03,400 --> 01:45:05,000
Oh, i got it.

1416
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:09,000
If the two of you want that
then it's all right dear.

1417
01:45:13,900 --> 01:45:15,200
May you always be happy.

1418
01:45:16,900 --> 01:45:19,000
You have come to poison
our lives here too?

1419
01:45:20,900 --> 01:45:22,300
Chander!
- No.

1420
01:45:23,500 --> 01:45:25,700
I dare anyone to touch him!

1421
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:28,400
Mini, come on.
- No! Leave me!

1422
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:30,200
Mini...
- I love him!

1423
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:34,300
Papa, i love him! I love him Papa!

1424
01:45:34,900 --> 01:45:36,600
I love Raju!
- Get out of here!

1425
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:38,000
Get lost!

1426
01:45:38,900 --> 01:45:40,000
Out!

1427
01:46:00,700 --> 01:46:02,600
Papa, how did all this happen?

1428
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:04,900
That boy was Chander's servant.

1429
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:06,400
I know.

1430
01:46:07,300 --> 01:46:09,100
That lowly servant!

1431
01:46:09,900 --> 01:46:11,600
Ruined our honor in the party.

1432
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:16,700
If you say, Papa, shall
we finish him off?

1433
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:19,400
Son, this matter is not so easy.

1434
01:46:20,200 --> 01:46:21,600
Mini loves that boy.

1435
01:46:22,700 --> 01:46:25,100
By killing him, the rest of
our plan will be ruined.

1436
01:46:26,900 --> 01:46:30,400
You only take care that Mini
should never meet that boy again.

1437
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:33,200
I didn't get your plan.

1438
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:37,900
This whole wealth and
property that we are...

1439
01:46:37,900 --> 01:46:43,000
... sitting on as owners,
is actually not ours.

1440
01:46:44,600 --> 01:46:45,800
It is Mini's.

1441
01:46:46,300 --> 01:46:48,500
And Mini doesn't know this yet.

1442
01:46:49,300 --> 01:46:50,700
I don't quite understand.

1443
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:56,200
Mini is not my daughter.

1444
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:00,400
She is not even your sister.

1445
01:47:02,200 --> 01:47:07,300
Mini is actually the daughter of my
distant brother Thakur Vikram Singh.

1446
01:47:09,500 --> 01:47:14,000
Since Vikram Singh always
used to be ill, i used...

1447
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,400
... to run his entire business.

1448
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:20,000
Mini doesn't know that instead
of giving medicine...

1449
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:23,500
... to his father, i poisoned him,
gradually and killed him.

1450
01:47:24,500 --> 01:47:28,000
To acquire his wealth, i
brought this girl up...

1451
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:29,400
... with great love and care.

1452
01:47:30,200 --> 01:47:32,500
You will never get this
wealth now, uncle.

1453
01:47:32,500 --> 01:47:33,700
Forget it!

1454
01:47:33,700 --> 01:47:35,600
You have opened my eyes today.

1455
01:47:36,500 --> 01:47:39,500
I didn't get you dear, what are you
doing here so late in the night?

1456
01:47:39,500 --> 01:47:41,100
I am looking at my father's killer!

1457
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:45,700
Oh, so you have heard everything.

1458
01:47:47,500 --> 01:47:49,600
This will be very
bad for both of us.

1459
01:47:50,600 --> 01:47:56,100
Rakesh dear. From today, this girl
should never get out of these walls.

1460
01:47:58,300 --> 01:48:03,100
Congratulations on your new
bungalow, son. - Thank you.

1461
01:48:03,100 --> 01:48:06,900
I came to know of it last
night that you have...

1462
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:08,400
... brought the whole family here.

1463
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:12,000
How is mother?
- She's all right.

1464
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:14,900
You did well by beating
up that scoundrel.

1465
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:16,200
Whatever it is.

1466
01:48:17,300 --> 01:48:21,300
By saving Rakesh from the gallows,
you were great Chander.

1467
01:48:22,300 --> 01:48:24,900
The man who saw Rakesh
killing was saying...

1468
01:48:24,900 --> 01:48:28,700
... in the court that he
hasn't seen anything.

1469
01:48:31,400 --> 01:48:35,000
To make him tell this lie,
how much we beat him up...

1470
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:36,400
... you can't even imagine.

1471
01:48:37,400 --> 01:48:39,000
I gave him electric shocks.

1472
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:40,400
I made him lie on ice slabs.

1473
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:42,400
I hung him over fire upside down...

1474
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:45,400
... created smoke by burning
chilies and got the bastard half dead.

1475
01:48:45,900 --> 01:48:48,200
With our beating, he became
unconscious 8- 10 times.

1476
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:50,600
Only after that he
lied in the court.

1477
01:48:52,200 --> 01:48:56,400
Otherwise no law could have
saved Rakesh from the gallows.

1478
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:59,000
That's why JK sir has
given you this huge...

1479
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:00,900
... bungalow and his
daughter as a gift.

1480
01:49:03,900 --> 01:49:05,200
Okay, we'll leave now.

1481
01:49:06,100 --> 01:49:07,600
Congratulations on the new bungalow!

1482
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:08,800
Thank you very much sir.

1483
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:14,600
No Laxmi, you will see.

1484
01:49:15,200 --> 01:49:18,200
One day, our two sons will grow up and
shine like the moon and the sun.

1485
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:21,800
And then we'll proudly
say they are our sons.

1486
01:49:33,100 --> 01:49:34,300
Mother!

1487
01:49:34,300 --> 01:49:35,500
So this is your face.

1488
01:49:38,500 --> 01:49:40,900
I was so innocent that i
immediately believed...

1489
01:49:40,900 --> 01:49:43,900
... that all this luxury
has been earned with...

1490
01:49:43,900 --> 01:49:45,300
... your hard work and honesty.

1491
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
No one can become a millionaire
honestly mother.

1492
01:49:48,200 --> 01:49:50,200
And we are ransacking
somebody's home.

1493
01:49:50,900 --> 01:49:53,100
If because of our intelligence
we are earning lakhs...

1494
01:49:53,100 --> 01:49:55,500
... and are about to become
the owners of property...

1495
01:49:55,500 --> 01:49:57,500
... worth billions, what
is wrong with that?

1496
01:49:57,500 --> 01:50:00,500
You can neither see anything the wall
of money nor will you ever see.

1497
01:50:00,500 --> 01:50:01,800
Today you have saved a killer.

1498
01:50:01,800 --> 01:50:04,500
Tomorrow, for money, you
can even kill a poor man.

1499
01:50:04,500 --> 01:50:05,600
Of course.

1500
01:50:07,400 --> 01:50:09,000
Mother, you have become old.

1501
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:10,200
Your age has gone mother.

1502
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:12,600
You won't understand the
things about modern age.

1503
01:50:13,300 --> 01:50:15,200
In this world, money is everything.

1504
01:50:15,200 --> 01:50:16,300
Money is God.

1505
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:18,600
Sin and good deeds is all rubbish!

1506
01:50:19,600 --> 01:50:21,100
You have fallen so much!

1507
01:50:27,100 --> 01:50:28,200
Here.

1508
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:30,700
Have some hot tea.

1509
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:33,700
I'll see who is there.

1510
01:50:34,900 --> 01:50:36,900
Who is there so early
in the morning?

1511
01:50:41,400 --> 01:50:42,600
Raju!

1512
01:51:10,300 --> 01:51:14,400
Raju, son. How are you?

1513
01:51:26,100 --> 01:51:27,200
Raju.

1514
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:37,700
I have come back to you.

1515
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:43,700
Look, i have even brought the
statue of God you had given me.

1516
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,100
My four pilgrimage centers
are at your feet mother.

1517
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:51,500
Why am i crying?

1518
01:51:54,100 --> 01:51:55,500
My mother has come home.

1519
01:51:55,500 --> 01:51:56,700
And i am crying!

1520
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:09,100
Hey Rahim uncle, hey Iqbal
uncle, my mother has come back!

1521
01:52:09,100 --> 01:52:10,600
Hey listen, my mother has come back!

1522
01:52:10,600 --> 01:52:14,200
Listen everybody, my
mother has come back!

1523
01:52:14,200 --> 01:52:18,500
Look, my mother has come back!

1524
01:52:19,300 --> 01:52:21,800
All of them were saying that
my mother won't come.

1525
01:52:42,600 --> 01:52:46,600
" She is my Yashoda mother..."

1526
01:52:46,600 --> 01:52:49,600
" I'm her Govinda..."

1527
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:55,400
" She is my Yashoda mother..."

1528
01:52:55,500 --> 01:52:58,200
" I'm her Govinda..."

1529
01:53:00,100 --> 01:53:08,700
" As long as mother is
there in this world..."

1530
01:53:08,700 --> 01:53:13,100
" The symbol of mother hood
is alive..."

1531
01:53:13,100 --> 01:53:17,300
" She is my Yashoda mother..."

1532
01:53:17,300 --> 01:53:20,300
" I'm her Govinda..."

1533
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:39,500
" A lover asked her beloved to
get his mother's heart..."

1534
01:53:42,200 --> 01:53:47,000
" Blindly he came running..."

1535
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:50,700
" To his mother..."

1536
01:53:53,200 --> 01:53:57,400
" The killer attacked mother..."

1537
01:53:57,400 --> 01:54:02,000
" He sent the dagger
through her chest..."

1538
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:06,300
" He ran with the wounded heart..."

1539
01:54:06,300 --> 01:54:10,600
 " He stumbled and fell
on the ground..."

1540
01:54:10,600 --> 01:54:15,100
" Then there was a cry from
the mother's heart..."

1541
01:54:17,900 --> 01:54:22,000
" Have you got hurt..."

1542
01:54:23,200 --> 01:54:26,300
" Have you got hurt..."

1543
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:31,000
" Walk slowly the next time..."

1544
01:54:31,900 --> 01:54:35,300
" She is my Yashoda mother..."

1545
01:54:35,400 --> 01:54:38,200
" I'm her Govinda..."

1546
01:55:01,600 --> 01:55:05,600
" A real mother, a false mother..."

1547
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:10,600
" Came with a quarrel over a child..."

1548
01:55:12,500 --> 01:55:16,700
" To ask for the justice."

1549
01:55:16,700 --> 01:55:21,200
" To a village chief's door..."

1550
01:55:23,400 --> 01:55:27,000
"One said this is my child..."

1551
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:31,700
" The other said, this is my child..."

1552
01:55:32,500 --> 01:55:36,400
" The village chief was perplexed..."

1553
01:55:36,400 --> 01:55:40,700
" Whose kid is this, actually..."

1554
01:55:43,400 --> 01:55:47,300
" He thought over it..."

1555
01:55:47,300 --> 01:55:51,400
" And ordered butchers..."

1556
01:55:54,100 --> 01:55:58,200
" Cut the head off from the body..."

1557
01:55:59,200 --> 01:56:02,400
" Divide the child..."

1558
01:56:03,400 --> 01:56:07,000
" Then the real mother said, wait..."

1559
01:56:07,900 --> 01:56:11,600
" Don't do it, don't do it..."

1560
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:22,100
" I give up my right..."

1561
01:56:22,100 --> 01:56:26,600
" But let my son live..."

1562
01:56:26,900 --> 01:56:30,000
" She is my Yashoda mother..."

1563
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:33,600
" I'm her Govinda..."

1564
01:56:35,500 --> 01:56:38,900
" She is my Yashoda mother..."

1565
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:42,500
" I'm her Govinda..."

1566
01:56:44,400 --> 01:56:53,000
" As long as mother is
there in this world..."

1567
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:57,300
" The symbol of mother hood
is alive..."

1568
01:56:57,300 --> 01:57:00,000
" She is my Yashoda mother..."

1569
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:04,300
" I'm her Govinda..."

1570
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:19,700
Mother, ever since you left, Raju
hasn't eaten well even a single day.

1571
01:57:20,300 --> 01:57:22,300
Mother also must have
not eaten well.

1572
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:24,300
Don't i know mother?

1573
01:57:24,900 --> 01:57:26,700
I forgot to ask you.

1574
01:57:26,700 --> 01:57:28,100
You... so suddenly... here?

1575
01:57:28,900 --> 01:57:30,500
Everything is all right, isn't it?

1576
01:57:31,400 --> 01:57:32,700
Chander brother... ?

1577
01:57:34,900 --> 01:57:38,500
They are very happy in the
heaven created by them son.

1578
01:57:41,100 --> 01:57:43,300
That's all. Don't ask anything more.

1579
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:45,300
Otherwise my heart will burst.

1580
01:57:45,300 --> 01:57:46,700
What happened mother?

1581
01:57:47,100 --> 01:57:48,300
Nothing son.

1582
01:57:49,400 --> 01:57:52,000
I wish Asha gets married and
there is a daughter- in- law...

1583
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:53,400
... in the house, that's all.

1584
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:55,600
I will fulfill your every dream.

1585
01:57:56,300 --> 01:57:58,700
But first of all, we'll marry
Asha off with great pomp!

1586
01:58:12,400 --> 01:58:17,300
Son, Ravi, i'm giving her to you.

1587
01:58:29,100 --> 01:58:30,200
Brother.

1588
01:58:58,400 --> 01:59:00,400
Now where is the need
for that long veil?

1589
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:04,600
Remove it and show me
a glimpe of your moonlike face.

1590
01:59:05,200 --> 01:59:08,100
Haven't you seen me before this?

1591
01:59:08,900 --> 01:59:11,600
I have. But where have
i seen you as a bride?

1592
01:59:12,600 --> 01:59:14,000
I am coming with you.

1593
01:59:14,300 --> 01:59:16,000
Today is our wedding night.

1594
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,100
It is reasonable to be impatient.

1595
01:59:33,400 --> 01:59:34,900
Hey, this is a forest!

1596
01:59:34,900 --> 01:59:36,500
Driver, where are
you taking the car?

1597
01:59:36,500 --> 01:59:37,800
Sir, the break has failed.

1598
01:59:47,900 --> 01:59:49,000
Ravi!

1599
01:59:51,900 --> 01:59:53,400
What? Do you recognize me?

1600
01:59:54,400 --> 01:59:55,500
You?

1601
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,500
You had put me in the lock-up!

1602
02:00:03,400 --> 02:00:07,100
That night, you had watched
the spectable of my helplessness.

1603
02:00:08,200 --> 02:00:11,500
They will all watch the
spectacle of your helplessness.

1604
02:00:14,400 --> 02:00:15,500
Help!

1605
02:00:16,100 --> 02:00:19,000
Come out!
- Don't dare touch her.

1606
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:24,500
Leave me.
- You hit me!

1607
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:27,900
You dare do that!

1608
02:00:27,900 --> 02:00:30,200
You hit me!

1609
02:00:34,300 --> 02:00:36,400
You hit me. Kill him!

1610
02:00:37,500 --> 02:00:38,800
Help me! Help me!

1611
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:44,200
Help me!

1612
02:00:47,300 --> 02:00:48,600
He shouldn't die now.

1613
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:50,600
Get the rope. Rope!

1614
02:00:53,900 --> 02:00:57,200
If he dies who will watch the
rest of the drama, your father?

1615
02:00:57,900 --> 02:00:59,100
Tie him to the tree. Tie him!

1616
02:00:59,100 --> 02:01:00,100
Help me!

1617
02:01:01,100 --> 02:01:02,600
Leave me! Leave!

1618
02:01:08,600 --> 02:01:10,500
No bastard, no!

1619
02:01:12,200 --> 02:01:13,400
What inspector!

1620
02:01:14,100 --> 02:01:17,100
Watch the wedding night
of your wife with your own eyes.

1621
02:01:17,100 --> 02:01:18,200
Leave her!

1622
02:01:19,200 --> 02:01:20,700
No Rakesh, no!

1623
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:27,000
No, no, no!

1624
02:01:33,900 --> 02:01:35,100
God!

1625
02:01:39,300 --> 02:01:40,700
The wedding is over isn't it?

1626
02:01:41,400 --> 02:01:43,300
What revenge i have taken inspector!

1627
02:01:49,200 --> 02:01:51,500
I will kill you bastard.

1628
02:01:51,900 --> 02:01:53,400
I will kill you!

1629
02:01:54,300 --> 02:01:56,200
I won't give you that opportunity.

1630
02:01:57,300 --> 02:01:58,500
Move! Move!

1631
02:02:01,300 --> 02:02:04,000
Ravi! Ravi!

1632
02:02:08,500 --> 02:02:09,500
Asha!
- Ravi!

1633
02:02:09,500 --> 02:02:10,800
Asha!

1634
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:13,500
Forgive me...

1635
02:02:13,500 --> 02:02:15,800
Forgive me...
- No, Ravi!

1636
02:02:19,400 --> 02:02:20,500
Ravi.

1637
02:02:20,500 --> 02:02:21,800
The bastard has died.

1638
02:02:23,500 --> 02:02:24,600
Come on.

1639
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:34,100
Ravi! Ravi!

1640
02:02:36,300 --> 02:02:37,500
How did this...?

1641
02:02:42,200 --> 02:02:45,000
Mother, today is such a happy
day for us, isn't it?

1642
02:02:45,400 --> 02:02:49,500
Today, i am very happy.

1643
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,100
My sister must be very happy today.

1644
02:02:56,300 --> 02:02:58,000
They love each other a lot, mother.

1645
02:03:00,200 --> 02:03:01,500
It's a lovely couple.

1646
02:03:02,600 --> 02:03:06,200
I am lucky that i got to see
such a day of happiness.

1647
02:03:08,900 --> 02:03:12,300
Who is knocking the door
so late in the night?

1648
02:03:12,400 --> 02:03:13,800
You wait, i'll see.

1649
02:03:31,100 --> 02:03:32,200
Asha!

1650
02:03:35,200 --> 02:03:41,300
You? Here? In this condition?

1651
02:03:43,400 --> 02:03:44,700
What has happened Asha?

1652
02:03:46,300 --> 02:03:47,500
What has happened?

1653
02:04:34,300 --> 02:04:35,600
How did this happen?

1654
02:04:37,300 --> 02:04:39,300
Tell me my sister how
did all this happen?

1655
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:44,200
What is his name?

1656
02:04:45,400 --> 02:04:46,700
What is his name?

1657
02:04:48,100 --> 02:04:54,100
JK's son Rakesh
ruined me completely!

1658
02:05:12,600 --> 02:05:16,400
No brother, don't risk your
life for unlucky me.

1659
02:05:16,400 --> 02:05:17,600
Leave me!

1660
02:05:17,600 --> 02:05:19,000
No brother. You are alone.

1661
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:20,300
I won't let you go.

1662
02:05:20,400 --> 02:05:22,400
Asha, i bind you to
my oath, leave me!

1663
02:05:29,700 --> 02:05:33,700
You bastard, son a bitch!

1664
02:06:16,300 --> 02:06:17,300
Rakesh...

1665
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:23,700
Move! I'll kill this bastard!

1666
02:06:24,400 --> 02:06:25,600
I won't leave him.

1667
02:06:25,600 --> 02:06:26,700
No son, no.

1668
02:06:26,700 --> 02:06:28,300
You are just out of jail.

1669
02:06:29,100 --> 02:06:31,000
Don't let your dirty
hands get dirtier.

1670
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:32,300
The police will do this job.

1671
02:06:35,500 --> 02:06:38,300
Suraj! You handcuff him just now!

1672
02:06:39,100 --> 02:06:42,100
Chander, you hang him right now!

1673
02:06:42,500 --> 02:06:44,200
We cannot do anything now.

1674
02:06:45,200 --> 02:06:47,000
We were always against
this marriage.

1675
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:49,100
Don't say that son.

1676
02:06:49,100 --> 02:06:52,500
If not for your sister, at least do
something for your widowed mother.

1677
02:06:53,400 --> 02:06:55,200
I beseech you.

1678
02:06:55,900 --> 02:06:57,100
I bow at your feet!

1679
02:06:57,400 --> 02:06:59,200
We'll marry Asha off somewhere else.

1680
02:06:59,500 --> 02:07:01,500
No one will ever come
to know about this.

1681
02:07:01,900 --> 02:07:04,500
If we have to spend a couple of
lakhs we'll spend that too.

1682
02:07:04,500 --> 02:07:06,100
But we will not stand against JK.

1683
02:07:08,200 --> 02:07:11,100
I had thought that you were
just after ill- gotten wealth.

1684
02:07:11,900 --> 02:07:16,100
But i have realized today that you can
even trade off your mother and sister.

1685
02:07:16,900 --> 02:07:18,700
Your sister's groom's
pyre has been lit.

1686
02:07:19,400 --> 02:07:22,000
But your blood hasn't
even come to a boil.

1687
02:07:22,900 --> 02:07:27,000
Oh scoundrels! To wash away their
sins, people go walking...

1688
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:28,400
... up to Kashi and Prayag.

1689
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:32,700
But i had brought both Kashi
and Prayag to your door.

1690
02:07:33,400 --> 02:07:36,600
But this good deed is not even
written in your destiny.

1691
02:07:37,500 --> 02:07:38,700
Fie on such sons!

1692
02:07:41,500 --> 02:07:42,600
Wait!

1693
02:07:43,400 --> 02:07:47,200
Yf you go to the court, then i
will have to fight this case against you.

1694
02:07:48,100 --> 02:07:50,300
What? - I am about to get
married to JK's daughter.

1695
02:07:50,300 --> 02:07:52,500
His property worth millions
is about to become mine.

1696
02:07:52,900 --> 02:07:56,100
Mother, father, brother, sister,
your own blood is it nothing for you?

1697
02:07:56,800 --> 02:07:58,400
One can get these in this world.

1698
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:02,000
But wealth that goes away
once never comes back.

1699
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:05,000
Even a demon like Ravana's
blood had boiled...

1700
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:06,600
... on Shoorpnakha's nose being cut.

1701
02:08:06,600 --> 02:08:09,600
But it seems you have
fallen lower than him!

1702
02:08:09,600 --> 02:08:12,100
Today, neither is there
a brother nor a sister.

1703
02:08:12,500 --> 02:08:15,900
A stranger comes to help
during trouble, mother.

1704
02:08:16,900 --> 02:08:19,900
Raju is better than you, who,
though not born...

1705
02:08:19,900 --> 02:08:24,100
... from my womb, he is still
ready to give up his life for us.

1706
02:08:24,100 --> 02:08:26,600
We are educated people. Thay
is why we use brains.

1707
02:08:27,400 --> 02:08:29,000
He is a stupid, illiterate,
villager!

1708
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
He is an illiterate, a villager?

1709
02:08:31,600 --> 02:08:33,900
You fool! The world has
died reading books...

1710
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:35,600
... but have none of them became wise.

1711
02:08:35,600 --> 02:08:38,000
It is one who studies the
2 syllables of love...

1712
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,200
... who becomes wise.
Come on Daughter.

1713
02:08:41,700 --> 02:08:44,700
Chander brother, after all,
Asha is our real sister.

1714
02:08:45,300 --> 02:08:46,600
Think over it again.

1715
02:08:47,400 --> 02:08:49,900
If you want the starving and
poverty of childhood...

1716
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:53,000
... then you too can do with
those stupid people.

1717
02:08:54,200 --> 02:08:55,700
If you want live in today's world...

1718
02:08:55,700 --> 02:08:58,100
... then use your brains,
not your heart.

1719
02:09:01,300 --> 02:09:04,900
My Lord, i am not interested
to know whether...

1720
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:06,500
... this girl has been raped or not.

1721
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
Neither am i interested
in whether her husband...

1722
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:10,800
... inspector Ravi has
been killed or not.

1723
02:09:11,600 --> 02:09:14,900
My question is whether
my client Rakesh...

1724
02:09:14,900 --> 02:09:16,500
... is responsible for this or not.

1725
02:09:17,400 --> 02:09:19,900
And to throw light on this
important question...

1726
02:09:19,900 --> 02:09:22,100
... i would like to present
an inportant witness.

1727
02:09:22,100 --> 02:09:23,000
Yes.

1728
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:24,200
Your name?

1729
02:09:24,500 --> 02:09:26,700
I'm known as Pankaj Chaluram MLA.

1730
02:09:27,400 --> 02:09:31,000
People call me affectionately
as Dadua.

1731
02:09:31,400 --> 02:09:32,900
This fool has begun
yapping here too.

1732
02:09:32,900 --> 02:09:35,000
I have sacrificed a lot, sir.

1733
02:09:35,600 --> 02:09:38,100
In the year 1942, when Gandhi
began his Quit India Movement...

1734
02:09:38,100 --> 02:09:40,100
What has Gandhi got
to do with this case?

1735
02:09:40,100 --> 02:09:41,600
You tell me only about yourself.

1736
02:09:41,600 --> 02:09:43,400
I am an MLA for 10 years.

1737
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:47,400
No one has been able to
defeat me in elections.

1738
02:09:47,400 --> 02:09:50,900
You can make anyone
stand against me.

1739
02:09:50,900 --> 02:09:53,400
You why sir, because i serve people.

1740
02:09:54,100 --> 02:09:55,400
Do you know the convict?

1741
02:09:56,100 --> 02:09:57,300
Do i know him?

1742
02:09:58,200 --> 02:10:00,100
Of course i know him.

1743
02:10:00,500 --> 02:10:02,600
He is the leader of my youth wing.

1744
02:10:05,400 --> 02:10:08,000
He is accused of raping
Asha on the night of...

1745
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,500
... December 30 and murdering
inspector Ravi.

1746
02:10:11,300 --> 02:10:14,000
Murder! Rape! Him!

1747
02:10:14,900 --> 02:10:16,600
He's like a chick.

1748
02:10:17,100 --> 02:10:19,000
He is the epitome of non- violence.

1749
02:10:19,900 --> 02:10:24,000
If a dog bites him, he'll
feed "jalebi" to that dog.

1750
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:27,900
And on December 30 he
was with me all night...

1751
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
... in the meeting of the youth wing.

1752
02:10:30,600 --> 02:10:33,100
The witness of this
is me, Chaluram MLA.

1753
02:10:33,900 --> 02:10:35,600
I am telling you sir,
this is all a lie.

1754
02:10:36,600 --> 02:10:38,400
In my register... give
me that register.

1755
02:10:39,500 --> 02:10:42,000
In my register, every account
of that day is there.

1756
02:10:43,500 --> 02:10:44,700
Look at this sir.

1757
02:10:45,400 --> 02:10:47,900
On the night of 30 December,
along with other members...

1758
02:10:47,900 --> 02:10:50,900
... is there the signature
of my child or not? Look.

1759
02:10:55,200 --> 02:10:58,600
This register is false,
it is forged.

1760
02:11:00,400 --> 02:11:03,000
It is a forgery?
- You have got it made later.

1761
02:11:09,500 --> 02:11:12,000
J.K. sir, Judge is laughing
at our witness...

1762
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:13,500
... i think we go with them.

1763
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:15,200
Shut up!

1764
02:11:16,100 --> 02:11:17,300
I have money.

1765
02:11:18,500 --> 02:11:22,200
I'll see whether the
law wins or money.

1766
02:11:23,300 --> 02:11:24,500
Get me the phone.

1767
02:11:24,900 --> 02:11:28,000
An innocent girl's life,
by raping her...

1768
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:31,400
... on her wedding night,
was ruined for ever.

1769
02:11:32,300 --> 02:11:34,100
What can be a bigger
crime than this?

1770
02:11:35,500 --> 02:11:38,900
But after considering the entire
case, the court also...

1771
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:42,900
... feels that in these conditions
and in such darkness...

1772
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:49,100
... a scared, innocent girl
can also make a mistake...

1773
02:11:49,100 --> 02:11:53,200
... in recognizing the
criminal's face.

1774
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,200
There is no eye- witness
to this incident either.

1775
02:11:59,200 --> 02:12:02,900
And it has also been proved
that on that night...

1776
02:12:02,900 --> 02:12:06,100
... convict Rakesh was present
with an honorable man...

1777
02:12:06,200 --> 02:12:08,100
... and a public servant.

1778
02:12:10,100 --> 02:12:14,200
So this court respectfully
frees convict Rakesh Kumar.

1779
02:12:34,200 --> 02:12:35,500
Wait there itself!

1780
02:12:37,400 --> 02:12:39,300
I had come here for justice.

1781
02:12:39,300 --> 02:12:41,900
But i have realized that people
with shady dealings....

1782
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:45,100
... with their shady money
and shady deeds have...

1783
02:12:45,100 --> 02:12:47,400
... also blackened the faces
of guardians of justice.

1784
02:12:47,400 --> 02:12:48,700
I won't let his happen.

1785
02:12:53,300 --> 02:12:55,200
My son.
- Move aside.

1786
02:13:04,100 --> 02:13:05,400
Doctor!

1787
02:13:06,400 --> 02:13:07,700
You don't have to worry.

1788
02:13:07,700 --> 02:13:09,700
Rakesh is safe.

1789
02:13:09,800 --> 02:13:11,300
Thank God. Thank you God.

1790
02:13:11,300 --> 02:13:12,400
Thank God.

1791
02:13:13,100 --> 02:13:17,200
Son, yesterday, we
also cremated Asha.

1792
02:13:18,500 --> 02:13:23,600
And that lowly killer has
gone free from the court.

1793
02:13:30,300 --> 02:13:31,600
The prisoner has escaped.

1794
02:13:31,600 --> 02:13:32,700
Look! Look!

1795
02:13:32,700 --> 02:13:33,900
Where has he gone?

1796
02:13:35,100 --> 02:13:36,400
I say stop or i'll shoot!

1797
02:13:36,500 --> 02:13:37,600
Catch him!

1798
02:13:38,100 --> 02:13:40,200
There he is! There is he is!

1799
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:42,500
He has run away from prison?

1800
02:13:43,900 --> 02:13:45,100
Is anybody there?

1801
02:13:45,100 --> 02:13:46,300
Guards!

1802
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:49,100
Raju you?

1803
02:13:49,100 --> 02:13:50,400
I have escaped from the lock-up.

1804
02:13:50,400 --> 02:13:51,600
Let me first go tell mother.

1805
02:13:51,600 --> 02:13:53,200
No, no, wait. There
is nobody inside.

1806
02:13:53,200 --> 02:13:55,600
I had gone to check on mother,
there is nobody inside.

1807
02:13:55,600 --> 02:13:56,900
There is just this slip.

1808
02:13:56,900 --> 02:13:58,400
It says, your mother is with us.

1809
02:13:58,400 --> 02:14:00,400
Come quietly to the old
fort's ruins at Ramgarh.

1810
02:14:00,400 --> 02:14:02,400
If you inform the police
or make a smart move...

1811
02:14:02,400 --> 02:14:03,700
... we'll kill the old woman.

1812
02:14:06,400 --> 02:14:07,600
Ramgarh!

1813
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:10,200
I was born in Ramgarh.

1814
02:14:11,200 --> 02:14:14,000
And somebody had killed
my father there.

1815
02:14:15,200 --> 02:14:17,100
But how JK be connected to Ramgarh?

1816
02:14:20,900 --> 02:14:25,300
Lad! Put all the weapons you
are carrying to the ground.

1817
02:14:26,600 --> 02:14:28,700
My hands are my weapons, JK.

1818
02:14:29,500 --> 02:14:32,000
Where is my mother?
- Don't worry.

1819
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,600
Before you die, we will fulfill
your last wish too.

1820
02:14:35,900 --> 02:14:38,300
Raka! Get mother!

1821
02:14:39,100 --> 02:14:43,900
Mother! - No,no. If you come
one step further, i will...

1822
02:14:43,900 --> 02:14:46,000
... blow mother's brains.

1823
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:48,200
You bloody jackal!

1824
02:14:49,300 --> 02:14:51,800
You point four machine
guns at my old mother...

1825
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:53,400
... and show your strength?

1826
02:14:53,400 --> 02:14:55,000
If you are a man,
then fight with me!

1827
02:14:55,100 --> 02:14:56,200
Catch him.

1828
02:14:56,200 --> 02:14:58,300
And put both of them in
separate dark cells.

1829
02:15:00,300 --> 02:15:04,200
Raja, to break this trap, you
alone will have to do something.

1830
02:15:32,600 --> 02:15:33,700
Laxmi!

1831
02:15:37,600 --> 02:15:38,700
Who is this?

1832
02:15:40,600 --> 02:15:41,800
I didn't recognize you.

1833
02:15:44,400 --> 02:15:45,600
Speak softly.

1834
02:15:46,500 --> 02:15:47,600
I am Anand.

1835
02:15:49,100 --> 02:15:50,200
What?

1836
02:15:59,900 --> 02:16:01,000
You?

1837
02:16:01,300 --> 02:16:08,100
Yes, me, Anand. Your husband.
I am not dead.

1838
02:16:09,600 --> 02:16:10,800
I am alive.

1839
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:33,000
I am a married woman.

1840
02:16:36,500 --> 02:16:37,700
I was not dead.

1841
02:16:38,600 --> 02:16:42,000
God gave me back the breaths
that were snatched from me.

1842
02:16:43,400 --> 02:16:46,600
These thugs picked me from home
and have imprisoned me here.

1843
02:16:47,600 --> 02:16:49,600
They have committed great
atrocities on me.

1844
02:16:50,400 --> 02:16:51,500
Why?

1845
02:16:53,400 --> 02:16:54,600
My dear son.

1846
02:16:55,400 --> 02:16:57,900
I had got that old woman
picked up because...

1847
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,300
... i wanted to teach a lesson
to that lowly lad.

1848
02:17:01,400 --> 02:17:03,400
What did know that it
would turn out to be...

1849
02:17:03,400 --> 02:17:05,400
... the key that i had
been looking for...

1850
02:17:05,400 --> 02:17:06,700
... the past twenty years.

1851
02:17:07,900 --> 02:17:13,000
Now we should invite both his
sons, Suraj and Chander.

1852
02:17:13,900 --> 02:17:16,100
Why have we been brought
here for dinner?

1853
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:20,000
When Boss is happy with somebody,
this is where he calls them for dinner.

1854
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:21,100
Come, come.

1855
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,500
I have invited you to
meet your parents.

1856
02:17:25,400 --> 02:17:26,600
Meet your mother.

1857
02:17:26,600 --> 02:17:27,800
Mother, you here?

1858
02:17:28,200 --> 02:17:29,400
Son, your father is alive.

1859
02:17:29,400 --> 02:17:30,700
What?

1860
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:34,300
He is your father, son.

1861
02:17:36,100 --> 02:17:38,300
JK, why have you locked
them up here?

1862
02:17:39,200 --> 02:17:41,300
You'll come to know very soon.

1863
02:17:41,300 --> 02:17:42,500
JK what is this?

1864
02:17:42,500 --> 02:17:44,200
You had invited us for a wedding.

1865
02:17:44,200 --> 02:17:45,400
Wedding?

1866
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:52,300
Dear. A son-in- law is needed
for someone who has a daughter.

1867
02:17:53,900 --> 02:17:58,000
It is enough for you to know
that i had poisoned...

1868
02:17:58,000 --> 02:17:59,300
... Mini's father long back.

1869
02:18:00,100 --> 02:18:01,800
Why have you tied us up?

1870
02:18:02,700 --> 02:18:05,700
Your father has hidden wealth
worth several billions somewhere.

1871
02:18:06,500 --> 02:18:08,900
I have been torturing him
for the last 20 years...

1872
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,300
... but the bastard doesn't
open his mouth.

1873
02:18:12,200 --> 02:18:13,700
Tie up this old man and woman.

1874
02:18:14,400 --> 02:18:17,500
And peel the skin off their sons.

1875
02:18:19,500 --> 02:18:20,600
Beat them up.

1876
02:18:21,100 --> 02:18:24,500
Don't beat them up.

1877
02:18:28,200 --> 02:18:29,500
Don't beat them.

1878
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:39,200
Beat them.

1879
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:43,600
More.
- No!

1880
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,600
No!
- Don't beat him!

1881
02:18:48,900 --> 02:18:50,100
Don't beat them.

1882
02:18:50,100 --> 02:18:51,900
It is better to kill
a sinner like me.

1883
02:18:53,100 --> 02:18:54,300
No!

1884
02:18:54,300 --> 02:18:55,500
I am a sinner.

1885
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:58,600
I am a killer of sister!

1886
02:19:00,400 --> 02:19:04,600
Enough! Enough!

1887
02:19:06,100 --> 02:19:07,600
Stop this beating.

1888
02:19:08,900 --> 02:19:11,500
I have seen the faces of
my kids after 30 years.

1889
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:18,400
And before my very eyes,
i can't see them being tortured.

1890
02:19:19,300 --> 02:19:20,500
I will tell you.

1891
02:19:20,500 --> 02:19:21,900
I will tell you everything.

1892
02:19:22,300 --> 02:19:23,500
Tell me! Tell me!

1893
02:19:23,500 --> 02:19:25,300
Where have you hidden that treasure?

1894
02:19:25,900 --> 02:19:27,200
Tell me, old man, tell me!

1895
02:19:27,200 --> 02:19:30,000
No, father, no! Our lives are
not more than the poor people...

1896
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:31,200
... of this country.

1897
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:32,800
Let us all die!

1898
02:19:33,400 --> 02:19:35,900
No matter how many snakes
engulf a sandalwood tree.

1899
02:19:36,101 --> 02:19:37,801
It doesn't let go of its fragrance.

1900
02:19:39,100 --> 02:19:40,300
Raju is right.

1901
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,300
As soon as you open your
mouth, he will kill of us, Papa.

1902
02:19:43,300 --> 02:19:45,300
You won't be able to save
us like this Papa.

1903
02:19:45,300 --> 02:19:46,500
Don't worry about us, Papa.

1904
02:19:46,500 --> 02:19:48,900
It is the duty of the sons to
sacrifice for their parents.

1905
02:19:48,900 --> 02:19:51,400
Okay, son. I won't tell him.

1906
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:54,400
I won't say anything to you.

1907
02:19:55,200 --> 02:19:57,600
Come on, Papa. We are proud of you.

1908
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,700
You won't tell me?

1909
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,100
Beat them up and peel
their skins off!

1910
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:16,700
Peel their flesh off!

1911
02:20:21,100 --> 02:20:24,100
There should not be even a drop
of blood left in their body.

1912
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:32,300
He is unconscious, Boss.

1913
02:20:32,500 --> 02:20:35,500
Take both these sons of
a bitch to their cages.

1914
02:20:36,500 --> 02:20:38,000
And when they come to their senses...

1915
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,200
... bring them back here
and hang them here.

1916
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:43,000
Until this old man,
opens his mouth...

1917
02:20:43,100 --> 02:20:45,400
... keep cutting them
up just like this.

1918
02:20:46,200 --> 02:20:50,100
After the die, we'll hang
this old woman here.

1919
02:20:51,200 --> 02:20:54,400
We'll see until when doesn't
this old man open his mouth.

1920
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,100
You son of a bitch, remember.

1921
02:20:57,900 --> 02:21:01,900
If i don't take revenge for
every thing you are doing...

1922
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:03,300
... then my name is not Raju.

1923
02:21:04,200 --> 02:21:06,200
I will make my shoes
out of your skin.

1924
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:10,400
Every pair of my shoes has been
made of some human's skin.

1925
02:21:11,200 --> 02:21:14,100
You will get your last shoes
made of your skin.

1926
02:21:14,400 --> 02:21:16,400
And that too with Raju's hands.

1927
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:18,600
I pledge to you.

1928
02:21:19,500 --> 02:21:20,700
That's a promise!
- Is it?

1929
02:21:21,400 --> 02:21:24,400
Son, i'll come tomorrow morning.

1930
02:21:31,500 --> 02:21:33,500
This time Boss will give
us a huge reward.

1931
02:21:34,100 --> 02:21:36,100
Last time we had got Rs. 10, 000.

1932
02:21:36,200 --> 02:21:38,400
This is time there so much
brown sugar, cocaine...

1933
02:21:38,400 --> 02:21:40,100
... marijuana, there is lots of money.

1934
02:21:40,100 --> 02:21:42,400
Come on let's get to work.

1935
02:21:42,400 --> 02:21:43,700
This is genuine stuff.

1936
02:21:43,700 --> 02:21:44,800
That'll be fun.

1937
02:21:52,400 --> 02:21:53,500
Oh my God!

1938
02:21:54,200 --> 02:21:55,400
This is like Ali Baba's cave.

1939
02:21:55,400 --> 02:21:57,400
Open Sesame!

1940
02:22:37,200 --> 02:22:38,300
Come, here. Come.

1941
02:22:43,900 --> 02:22:45,500
Hide!

1942
02:22:50,400 --> 02:22:53,400
For the first time in my life,
i have seen a walking drum.

1943
02:22:54,100 --> 02:22:56,400
Yes, i am a walking drum.

1944
02:22:56,400 --> 02:22:58,400
It seems Boss has made
a robot and sent it.

1945
02:22:58,600 --> 02:23:01,100
He has made a robot and sent.

1946
02:23:02,200 --> 02:23:04,300
Bring your head down!

1947
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:09,100
Hail Bajrangbali!

1948
02:23:09,100 --> 02:23:10,200
He's gone!

1949
02:23:10,601 --> 02:23:12,701
Give me the bunch of keys
before leaving, prince.

1950
02:23:13,400 --> 02:23:16,300
Your waist may break
because of its weight.

1951
02:23:17,200 --> 02:23:19,200
Come out of the zoo quickly.

1952
02:23:20,900 --> 02:23:24,100
Mother, father, Suraj and Chander
brothers are locked up here too.

1953
02:23:24,100 --> 02:23:26,600
Come. - But in such a big place,
where will we look for them?

1954
02:23:26,600 --> 02:23:28,300
You go that side, i'll
look this side.

1955
02:23:45,100 --> 02:23:46,300
Chander brother!

1956
02:23:47,500 --> 02:23:48,700
Buntu! You?

1957
02:23:49,500 --> 02:23:51,300
How did you come here?

1958
02:23:56,200 --> 02:23:58,300
Brother, i am a traveler here.

1959
02:23:58,300 --> 02:23:59,500
I came here by mistake.

1960
02:23:59,500 --> 02:24:01,000
Which is the way out from here?

1961
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:02,600
Come, we'll show you the way.

1962
02:24:03,500 --> 02:24:05,000
A little slowly.
- Come on.

1963
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:09,000
I too have some dignity.
- So you are Raju's friend.

1964
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
What friend, sir, his hanger-on.

1965
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:12,100
I live on it.

1966
02:24:12,100 --> 02:24:14,100
Now that they have
brought me to you...

1967
02:24:14,100 --> 02:24:16,400
... i will start hanging
around you from today.

1968
02:24:16,400 --> 02:24:17,800
Who has brought him here, who?

1969
02:24:18,600 --> 02:24:21,100
Sir, the desire to serve
you has brought me here.

1970
02:24:21,400 --> 02:24:23,200
It is a question of
my bread and butter.

1971
02:24:23,200 --> 02:24:24,200
No.

1972
02:24:24,200 --> 02:24:25,400
I think this guy is a fraud.

1973
02:24:25,400 --> 02:24:28,000
A lollypop on the surface
and a sweet dagger from within.

1974
02:24:28,400 --> 02:24:29,700
Don't get taken in by him.

1975
02:24:29,700 --> 02:24:30,800
Tie him up with them.

1976
02:24:30,800 --> 02:24:32,800
Oh no sir. Give me an
opportunity to serve you.

1977
02:24:32,800 --> 02:24:34,000
Take him out.
- No sir!

1978
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:35,300
Let me stay at your feet.

1979
02:24:35,300 --> 02:24:37,400
Where are you taking me.

1980
02:24:37,400 --> 02:24:38,500
JK sir!

1981
02:24:40,400 --> 02:24:43,100
Has this fool come to
rescue his friends?

1982
02:24:44,400 --> 02:24:46,300
Oh God!
- It could be possible.

1983
02:24:51,600 --> 02:24:53,600
Dad, that bastard has escaped.

1984
02:24:53,600 --> 02:24:55,000
Let's see where he has gone.

1985
02:24:58,200 --> 02:25:00,100
He is very dangerous man, son.

1986
02:25:00,600 --> 02:25:03,100
That is why you two have to
be freed from here first.

1987
02:25:03,500 --> 02:25:05,300
I will take you to the police.

1988
02:25:09,400 --> 02:25:10,500
Come, mother.

1989
02:25:10,500 --> 02:25:11,600
No, son.

1990
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,300
Chander and Suraj are trapped
in these caves too.

1991
02:25:14,900 --> 02:25:16,200
Buntu has gone to free them.

1992
02:25:16,200 --> 02:25:18,900
I won't leave them to these
wild wolves and go.

1993
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:20,600
I won't go without you mother.

1994
02:25:20,600 --> 02:25:22,000
I bind you to my oath son.

1995
02:25:22,100 --> 02:25:23,600
Don't say anything further son.

1996
02:25:24,100 --> 02:25:25,600
Don't say anything further.

1997
02:25:25,600 --> 02:25:28,900
You think that today,
i am asking you for...

1998
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,100
... the price of my milk, son.

1999
02:25:31,100 --> 02:25:32,900
They should be stopped soon, Dad.

2000
02:25:32,900 --> 02:25:34,200
Otherwise, they will escape.

2001
02:25:34,200 --> 02:25:35,300
Let them.

2002
02:25:35,900 --> 02:25:39,900
Actually, keep a car outside for
them, so that it is easier...

2003
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:41,700
... for them to escape.

2004
02:25:42,600 --> 02:25:45,400
I don't understand, what's
going on in your mind, Dad.

2005
02:25:46,100 --> 02:25:49,300
Son, their death is making
them run away from here.

2006
02:26:01,300 --> 02:26:02,600
What are you saying?

2007
02:26:02,600 --> 02:26:04,700
Where did you hide the gold
for 20 to 22 years?

2008
02:26:05,300 --> 02:26:09,000
When JK took away the police
van to destroy it...

2009
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:10,700
... i took the gold boxes in my jeep...

2010
02:26:10,900 --> 02:26:12,200
... and went to the river bank.

2011
02:26:12,200 --> 02:26:16,000
There i kept both the boxes on
the forest department's boat...

2012
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:17,400
... which always used to be there.

2013
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:21,500
I opened the ropes of the boat and
it started floating rapidly.

2014
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,900
Being a forest officer i
knew that the boat will...

2015
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:30,000
... float till 2 kilometer with the
flow of water and will fall...

2016
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:31,500
... down at Tiger stream.

2017
02:26:32,900 --> 02:26:35,000
And there's a deep pit
under the stream.

2018
02:26:35,900 --> 02:26:38,000
Where both the boxes will
drown from the boat.

2019
02:26:38,600 --> 02:26:41,200
And nobody will come to
know about the gold.

2020
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:43,500
Even today i'm very much sure that...

2021
02:26:43,500 --> 02:26:45,400
... gold is still there
under that stream.

2022
02:26:45,900 --> 02:26:47,900
We must contact the
headquarters right now.

2023
02:26:49,400 --> 02:26:50,500
Hands up.

2024
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:52,400
Well done, forest officer.

2025
02:26:52,900 --> 02:26:56,000
Thank you very much for
telling us the secret...

2026
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:59,000
... about the gold. Now we'll
immediately go and take out...

2027
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:02,200
... the gold from there. And this
time i won't delay in killing you.

2028
02:27:02,400 --> 02:27:05,100
JK, do you think i'm such
a foolish person?

2029
02:27:06,100 --> 02:27:09,000
I already had a doubt how
come i came here so easily?

2030
02:27:09,900 --> 02:27:12,000
So i didn't give him
the right address.

2031
02:27:12,600 --> 02:27:15,300
Now if you can kill me. Then
you're free to do so.

2032
02:27:15,600 --> 02:27:19,100
Fire at me. You won't get the gold.

2033
02:27:19,100 --> 02:27:20,300
Hands up!

2034
02:27:20,900 --> 02:27:23,400
Don't fire at this old man. He
has still not given us the...

2035
02:27:23,400 --> 02:27:25,900
... right address of gold.
- Raju, you please run away...

2036
02:27:25,900 --> 02:27:28,000
... from here.
- No, Papa. I won't go without you.

2037
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,100
They can't kill me. You
just run away from here.

2038
02:27:31,200 --> 02:27:33,300
If you'll be killed then...
- Move... move...

2039
02:27:33,300 --> 02:27:34,700
Raju, you please run away.

2040
02:27:38,200 --> 02:27:40,200
If you say, shall we search
from him everywhere?

2041
02:27:40,200 --> 02:27:41,300
No need of it.

2042
02:27:41,300 --> 02:27:44,200
He'll come here to save this
old man. Where he can go?

2043
02:27:57,000 --> 02:28:00,200
Can't you see the bee in this?

2044
02:28:00,200 --> 02:28:01,500
Where's it?

2045
02:28:07,200 --> 02:28:10,200
Don't you dare? If you dare to
shout i'll cut your throat.

2046
02:28:14,200 --> 02:28:15,600
Stop her. Somebody please stop her.

2047
02:28:15,600 --> 02:28:17,100
Look, she's running away. Catch her.

2048
02:28:17,100 --> 02:28:20,000
Baby has escaped. Somebody
please catch her.

2049
02:28:59,600 --> 02:29:03,300
Hello!
- Rakesh, JK here. - Yes, Dad.

2050
02:29:03,300 --> 02:29:04,700
Good news, my son.

2051
02:29:05,400 --> 02:29:07,400
Did you get the gold?
- Not yet.

2052
02:29:08,100 --> 02:29:10,100
But perhaps it's lying under
the tiger water fall.

2053
02:29:10,100 --> 02:29:12,100
We're going there.
- Good luck, dad.

2054
02:29:12,100 --> 02:29:15,000
I also have a bad news.
We've missed Raju.

2055
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,900
Oh my god!
- But he'll definitely come to us...

2056
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,600
... to save that old man.

2057
02:29:22,400 --> 02:29:26,200
Daddy, the moment you see
that rascal shot him dead.

2058
02:29:26,200 --> 02:29:29,600
Don't worry, my son. This
will be our first priority.

2059
02:29:29,600 --> 02:29:31,900
You just kill those three
imprisons right now...

2060
02:29:31,900 --> 02:29:34,300
... and reach to our house
with that old lady.

2061
02:29:34,300 --> 02:29:38,000
I'm sending this old man
there with Robert.

2062
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:39,200
Prepare to hang them on noose.

2063
02:29:39,200 --> 02:29:40,700
I'll collect the gold
and reach there.

2064
02:29:40,700 --> 02:29:45,000
Ok, dad. But don't forget
to kill Raju.

2065
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,300
The moment you see that
rascal shot him dead.

2066
02:29:47,300 --> 02:29:48,400
Bye Dad.

2067
02:30:00,600 --> 02:30:01,800
Actually... oh!

2068
02:30:12,100 --> 02:30:13,600
C'mon!
- Where are you taking me?

2069
02:30:14,400 --> 02:30:17,400
To kill you. Shoot the rest
of the three imprisons.

2070
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:22,500
C'mon!
- My Lord! Please protect us.

2071
02:30:23,400 --> 02:30:24,500
What happened?

2072
02:30:24,900 --> 02:30:26,700
Look there. A god
of death is coming.

2073
02:30:30,600 --> 02:30:33,400
God bless us! He has come.

2074
02:30:34,900 --> 02:30:37,100
I've got the order to kill
all three of you right now.

2075
02:30:37,100 --> 02:30:38,200
C'mon, get ready.

2076
02:30:38,200 --> 02:30:41,000
Brother, if you really want to kill
then please don't kill us...

2077
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:44,100
... separately. Please
sent us at once.

2078
02:30:44,100 --> 02:30:48,000
So that at the door
of God we can go on...

2079
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:49,600
... hunger strike for your promotion.

2080
02:30:49,600 --> 02:30:52,600
Ok, now go back and stand
in a queue. C'mon.

2081
02:30:53,300 --> 02:30:57,700
He'll kill us. C'mon,
stand in a queue.

2082
02:30:59,100 --> 02:31:01,200
Shit! This has happened
because of you.

2083
02:31:01,200 --> 02:31:03,000
Raju has opened my eyes.

2084
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:05,300
I had started hating you from
the same day when you...

2085
02:31:05,300 --> 02:31:07,700
... had decided to defend
Rakesh in Asha's case.

2086
02:31:07,700 --> 02:31:09,300
I had refused you to do so.
- Enough!

2087
02:31:09,300 --> 02:31:10,500
You're a snake.

2088
02:31:10,500 --> 02:31:13,600
Can't you listen to me?
- Do you call me snake?

2089
02:31:15,200 --> 02:31:17,100
You're not eligible to
call yourself brother.

2090
02:31:17,100 --> 02:31:19,700
You rascal.
- What are you doing?

2091
02:31:21,200 --> 02:31:23,100
Hands up! And stand in a queue.

2092
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,100
Yes, stand in a queue.

2093
02:31:26,100 --> 02:31:27,600
Take us where our mother has gone.

2094
02:31:28,600 --> 02:31:31,200
C'mon, hurry up. Otherwise
you'll be dead here.

2095
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,500
Move!
- C'mon, turn back.

2096
02:31:35,500 --> 02:31:36,700
Stand in a queue?

2097
02:31:50,300 --> 02:31:54,300
Well done! I've got the gold!
I've got the gold.

2098
02:31:54,300 --> 02:31:55,700
I've become a millionaire.

2099
02:31:59,100 --> 02:32:02,100
I've become a millionaire. Now
i can buy the entire world.

2100
02:32:03,200 --> 02:32:07,200
Why are you dancing here? Go
and load the gold in van.

2101
02:32:11,100 --> 02:32:14,600
Slowly, my dear. Slowly.
I've got the gold.

2102
02:32:14,600 --> 02:32:17,600
Well done, my boys.
I'll make you reach.

2103
02:32:18,900 --> 02:32:21,600
Slowly! Slowly! Well done!

2104
02:32:22,400 --> 02:32:25,000
Tell your boys. If anybody
will take the gun in hand...

2105
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:26,300
... he'll invite his death.

2106
02:32:26,700 --> 02:32:28,100
Tell me, where's my papa?

2107
02:32:31,400 --> 02:32:36,100
Let me tell you about
your entire family.

2108
02:32:37,500 --> 02:32:40,500
Your parents are waiting for
their death in our fort.

2109
02:32:41,600 --> 02:32:43,500
Only my signal is awaited.

2110
02:32:44,500 --> 02:32:46,900
And we'll kill you and throw
you in the water here.

2111
02:32:48,300 --> 02:32:50,500
Before dying also know
about your lover.

2112
02:32:51,600 --> 02:32:57,000
We've got the gold now after
gaabbing her entire property...

2113
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,200
... we'll also send her to you.

2114
02:33:00,100 --> 02:33:03,500
You greedy, forget grabbing
her property.

2115
02:33:04,400 --> 02:33:07,000
Because it's clearly written
on your head that the gold...

2116
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,400
... that you've captured and is
lying in that jeep there.

2117
02:33:09,500 --> 02:33:11,500
Somebody will escape
with it very soon.

2118
02:33:12,500 --> 02:33:15,000
You're forecasting my future?

2119
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:18,100
What to do? Your destiny is such.

2120
02:33:24,600 --> 02:33:25,700
Raju, come soon.

2121
02:33:32,400 --> 02:33:33,600
Drive fast.

2122
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:42,000
When we want to kill
somebody like this...

2123
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:45,000
... that his dead body
can't be found...

2124
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,500
We hang them here like this
and cut the rope from above.

2125
02:33:47,900 --> 02:33:50,300
The moment the rope gets cut
the wheel moves rapidly...

2126
02:33:50,300 --> 02:33:53,300
... and the person fells down directly
into the hungry lion's mouth.

2127
02:33:57,200 --> 02:34:00,000
These lions are hungry
from last 4 days.

2128
02:34:00,500 --> 02:34:03,600
They will enjoy eating you.
And will bless us.

2129
02:34:10,500 --> 02:34:12,400
We're just waiting for daddy.

2130
02:34:23,400 --> 02:34:25,500
Bring their sons corpses.

2131
02:34:26,300 --> 02:34:30,000
Let them take their last
sight before dying.

2132
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:34,000
You've remembered us and we're here.

2133
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:37,000
Suraj!
- Chander! - Are you alive?

2134
02:34:38,200 --> 02:34:39,400
Chanda, move!

2135
02:34:45,400 --> 02:34:46,900
I won't give you. I won't give you.

2136
02:34:46,900 --> 02:34:48,300
I won't give you. Ok take it.

2137
02:35:04,100 --> 02:35:07,300
Rascal, it seems you're destined
to die by my hands.

2138
02:35:08,200 --> 02:35:11,700
Those who decide to repent
never fear of death.

2139
02:35:11,700 --> 02:35:14,600
Bring those two rascals here.

2140
02:35:17,300 --> 02:35:21,900
Slowly!
- Rascals, today i'll send you to...

2141
02:35:21,900 --> 02:35:27,400
... your sister in front
of your parents.

2142
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:43,900
You bring the police.
I'll handle them.

2143
02:35:45,300 --> 02:35:46,400
No!

2144
02:36:28,400 --> 02:36:29,500
Brother!

2145
02:36:46,200 --> 02:36:48,700
I'll kill those two old man
and woman before dying.

2146
02:36:55,400 --> 02:36:57,600
No! Raju!

2147
02:37:18,500 --> 02:37:19,600
No!

2148
02:37:30,200 --> 02:37:35,500
O god! He's a mountain. Mountain!

2149
02:37:45,500 --> 02:37:49,100
Raju! Raju!
- Papa!

2150
02:38:59,100 --> 02:39:01,100
Papa! Papa!

2151
02:39:08,200 --> 02:39:10,700
He has given poison to
my father. Kill him.

2152
02:39:18,100 --> 02:39:19,200
Raju!

2153
02:39:22,200 --> 02:39:23,300
Raju!

2154
02:39:30,100 --> 02:39:36,000
Raju!
- Mummy, i hope papa is not injured.

2155
02:39:36,100 --> 02:39:41,900
Who are you to me? You've
saved my nuptial...

2156
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:44,000
... at the sake of your life.

2157
02:39:44,300 --> 02:39:45,600
I'm your son, mummy.

2158
02:40:00,300 --> 02:40:05,300
" When their days will change..."

2159
02:40:05,300 --> 02:40:09,800
" They will take the...
