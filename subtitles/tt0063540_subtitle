1
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:19,680
"Where the compassion
tolerates iniquity."

2
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,680
"Where enmity tolerates the sin."

3
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:33,880
"Where anger is suppressed."

4
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:40,440
"Where forgiveness
resides in every eye."

5
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,480
Excuse me.

6
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,040
Where is the inn of Mr. Bhavaniprasad?

7
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,680
It is in the market.
- Whom are you asking for?

8
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,680
Have you come on a journey?

9
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,200
Then wait in the hermitage.

10
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,160
No.

11
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,320
I shall wait in the
inn of that great man.

12
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,840
You are getting involved
into the wrong person.

13
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,920
To save the people from him,
this hermitage has been opened.

14
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,680
No.

15
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,200
I won't wait anywhere else.

16
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,760
I have heard that Mr.
Bhavaniprasad is like a God.

17
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,440
Mother.

18
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,440
Kundan.

19
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,680
My boy.

20
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,040
Why have you come here?

21
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,840
What if grandfather sees you?

22
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,080
I had made this porridge.

23
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,240
I have got it for you.

24
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,440
You have it fast.

25
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,200
What is it?

26
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,360
Don't you remember your mother?

27
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,720
I remember you a lot.

28
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,960
But what can be done?

29
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,040
I am very scared of grandfather.

30
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,040
I can't even cry in front of him.

31
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,680
Whenever I miss you, mother.

32
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,600
I cry secretly.

33
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,800
Your grandfather is very heartless.

34
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:19,880
Take this.

35
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,240
Wear it around your neck.

36
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,160
I have got this from far off place.

37
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,280
There is God's blessing in it.

38
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,000
Now you are growing up.

39
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,640
Your grandfather will
give you initiation.

40
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,880
That time God will save you.
- Kundan.

41
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,680
What are you wearing around your neck?

42
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,720
Remove it.

43
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,440
No grandfather.

44
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,840
Give it to me, I say.

45
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,040
Oh God.

46
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,640
Give it to me.

47
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,080
I have told you many times
not to believe in this mother.

48
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,000
A son should not trust his mother?

49
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,800
Has this ever happened?

50
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,840
There is no other mother
for Kundan except for Akali.

51
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,480
And he has to trust on her powers.

52
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,840
Mother.

53
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,760
Daughter-in-law.

54
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,800
Mother.

55
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,280
Mother.

56
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,560
Cry out your tears.

57
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,800
Cry as much as you want.

58
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,840
It is better if your tears dry out.

59
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,800
You have to try hard to live.

60
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,880
What happened?

61
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,960
Why is Kundan's mother so excited?

62
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,000
It is the motherhood
which is getting excited.

63
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,160
She had taken porridge for Kundan.

64
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,520
He couldn't eat it at all.

65
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,560
Before he could eat, father-in-law..

66
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,720
..didn't let him have it.

67
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,680
I have told you so many times.

68
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,440
To be strong.

69
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,680
Not to meet him.

70
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,200
How can I avoid meeting him?

71
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,400
A father can be strong enough.

72
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,920
But what can a mother do?

73
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,680
Tell me?

74
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,040
We can console ourselves
if god snatches away our child.

75
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,240
But, if a ruthless
man on this earth..

76
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,760
Why are you silent?

77
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,680
Speak.

78
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,760
If you have the guts
then complete your sentence.

79
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,640
I had told you to avoid.

80
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,600
That you people shouldn't
meet Kundan at all.

81
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,520
Do you know the consequences
of not obeying me?

82
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,440
Don't say anything, did you hear that?

83
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,440
She is sad because of you.

84
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,200
Not because of me,
but because of herself.

85
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,560
She has done some magic.

86
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,760
She separated the son away.

87
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,160
Let her suffer for her own actions.

88
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,360
Oh, you are crying.

89
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,000
See my hands have become
wet due to your tears.

90
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,440
Father.

91
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,320
See Kundan is crying.

92
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,840
And he is not telling
me what the matter is.

93
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,280
I kept my hands on his eyes.

94
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,480
Then I found my hands
to be wet with his tears.

95
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,920
You ask him what is wrong with him.

96
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,240
Why is he crying?

97
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,880
When I asked him,
he said nothing happened.

98
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,600
But I am sure there
is something wrong with him.

99
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,760
He is crying.

100
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,120
Girl.

101
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,560
You have said before,
to breathe while talking.

102
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,080
Not to speak like a parrot.

103
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,080
Come on let us see
what is wrong with Kundan.

104
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,120
Kundan, why are you crying?

105
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,320
Mother had come to meet me.

106
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,520
Grandfather scolded her a lot.

107
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,200
She went back crying.

108
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,360
Don't worry son.

109
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,800
When you will grow up..

110
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,760
You leave your grandfather
and go back to your mother.

111
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,440
Play this instrument.

112
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,560
No, I won't play it today.

113
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,560
Kundan, you play it, I will dance.

114
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,240
She is right, you both will enjoy it.

115
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,400
Play it.

116
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,000
She is a very sweet girl.

117
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,320
What is her name?

118
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,840
He is name is also sweet.

119
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,840
Munni.

120
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,320
Eshwarlal.

121
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,320
I wanted to adopt this kind of girl.

122
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,400
Do you know all her details?

123
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,160
Yes.

124
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,240
Six years back.

125
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,240
Her parents drowned in the Ganga.

126
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,240
She was two years old then.

127
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,200
She came along the shore
floating on the waves.

128
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,560
And from there the old man saved her.

129
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,280
Since then she has
been living with the old man.

130
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,920
Will the old man agree to give her away?
- Why not?

131
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,480
He's worried that he may die any day.

132
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,360
What will happen
to the girl after him?

133
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,240
If you adopt her he'll
be relived of this burden.

134
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,160
Tell him that god hasn't
blessed you with a child..

135
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,120
..and you're a childless woman.

136
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,880
That's the reason
you want to adopt the girl. - Okay.

137
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,880
I hope you don't have any problem.
- It's all because of the divine blessings.

138
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,440
Remain seated.

139
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,480
They're the family with whom Naubatlal's
men weren't sharing our address.

140
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,800
I don't know where
they wanted to misguide us.

141
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,360
I've heard that Banaras
is full of imposters.

142
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,360
I thought that
they also might be thugs.

143
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,783
No, my child.

144
00:09:22,897 --> 00:09:26,724
It's a sin to doubt somebody.

145
00:09:27,091 --> 00:09:28,140
You're great.

146
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:31,836
I feel at peace after
getting to behold you.

147
00:09:32,928 --> 00:09:35,021
I've come from a distant land
with lot of hopes..

148
00:09:35,101 --> 00:09:38,031
..and we planned to live
in your guest house.

149
00:09:38,971 --> 00:09:40,518
I've heard a lot
of praises about you.

150
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,751
I'm your servant.

151
00:09:42,831 --> 00:09:44,960
You're exactly what we had heard
and expected you to be.

152
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,040
I'm blessed to have you as my guest.

153
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,360
You've come with lot of devotion..

154
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,520
..I'll personally accompany you
during the prayer. - Thanks a lot.

155
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,440
From where did you
get such nice clothes?

156
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,640
Mother gave me.

157
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,160
Do you know, I got my parents back?
- From where?

158
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,200
I met them.

159
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,480
Mother says when I was small.

160
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,000
I got lost in a fair.

161
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,640
And now they got me back
after great difficulties.

162
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,040
Where are your parents?

163
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,160
There they are.

164
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,600
Do you know.

165
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,840
They have paid uncle a lot of money.

166
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,840
And they gave me nice clothes.

167
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,160
I am going with them.
- Where?

168
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,920
Very far.

169
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,080
Going to Calcutta.

170
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,040
When will you come back?

171
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,920
When I will grow up.

172
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,760
How will I recognise you?

173
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,960
I shall recognise you.

174
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,880
You keep this instrument
with you always.

175
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,400
I will recognise you by this.

176
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,240
Okay I am going.

177
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,360
My daughter.

178
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,320
Kundan, keep the
instrument safe with you.

179
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,320
Let's go dear.

180
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,120
You boys.

181
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,320
What are you doing?

182
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,320
Get out.

183
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,840
Get out.

184
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,040
Get up.

185
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,382
How dare you stare at me, rascals?

186
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:12,520
Naubatlal is destined to get
killed by your grandfather.

187
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,600
Well done my boys.

188
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,160
This is how you must
treat Naubatlal's children.

189
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,600
That Bhim came in
between to save Kundan.

190
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,280
Otherwise I and Ganeshi
would have taught him a lesson.

191
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,880
Son Dwarka, next time shall see them,
where will he go?

192
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,720
Someday or the other we will definitely
take revenge from them of our ancestors.

193
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,320
They must be your enemies.

194
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,200
Why are you teaching enmity
against them to my kids?

195
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,000
I don't want even them to keep roaming here
and there for revenge when they grow up.

196
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,240
These are not coward's children,
Ganeshi's mother.

197
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,000
We son and the father. - Will definitely
destroy Bhavaniprasad's family.

198
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,920
Who dare to?

199
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,320
Who can even think to destroy
my family in front of me?

200
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,640
Oh.

201
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,640
You came to the den
to challenge the tiger?

202
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,440
I will throw you out of this den.

203
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,440
How could your sons even dare to..

204
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,520
..raise hands on my Kundan?

205
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,920
Even I can raise
my hands in this matter.

206
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,960
If you remain in front
of me for some more time.

207
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,200
Then with your bad blood..

208
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,120
..I have to dirty my house.

209
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,200
You purify it.

210
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,480
Sir, if you say then
shall I with his blood..

211
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,680
..make his house impure?

212
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,400
Get my weapon.
- No.

213
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,360
No, I won't let this happen
in front of my eyes. - You get aside.

214
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,040
Today either he will survive, or me.

215
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,120
Why are you both behind
each other's lives?

216
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,160
There is the kind of
blood in both your bodies.

217
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,600
Why do you forget?

218
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,760
Your grandfather was his father cousin.

219
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,080
This brotherhood got
destroyed that day itself..

220
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,240
..when his father killed my grandfather.

221
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,800
We have blood relationship.

222
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,840
But now we need not follow it.

223
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,120
But only destroy it.

224
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,200
Today I will kill him.

225
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,760
Naubatlal.

226
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,560
Don't cross your limits.

227
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,160
Otherwise your children
will get orphan today itself.

228
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,640
Please don't say that?
- Ganeshi's mother.

229
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,760
You stay back.

230
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,920
I have not learnt to disrespect females
while the males are having a dispute.

231
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,640
I wish that your
husband lives for years.

232
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,160
But explain this stupid person.

233
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,200
Not to mess with Bhavaniprasad.

234
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,520
Wait.

235
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,560
I feel like strangling you.

236
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,840
My enemy challenges me in my house..

237
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,560
..and return back safe.

238
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,080
Mother.

239
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,560
One more devotee
is here in front of you.

240
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,960
Fill his heart with your devotions.

241
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,640
He will be your strong devotee.

242
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,880
I will tell him today.

243
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,120
What is the religion of his ancestors.

244
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,800
Today he will realise.

245
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,880
That worshipping you.

246
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,280
Is a big job.

247
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,040
Tonight I will give him an initiation.

248
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,960
Give strength to this child.

249
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,280
This prayer will get complete..

250
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,480
..when a man will sacrifice
all the desires in this world.

251
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,400
Will quit all his relationships.

252
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,440
Hence you will have to sacrifice
your son and your daughter-in-law.

253
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,760
Son and daughter-in-law?

254
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,960
Son.

255
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,960
Mr. Bhavaniprasad.

256
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,600
Don't worry.

257
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,600
You can buy them again
by performing the prayer.

258
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,600
First you sacrifice your son.

259
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,960
Here I give you my son.

260
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,160
Now sacrifice your daughter-in-law.

261
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,160
I give you my daughter-in-law.

262
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,440
Now you could buy your son again.

263
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,200
I bought my son for fifty one rupees.

264
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,160
Fifty one is very less.
- Is it?

265
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,200
Don't bother for the money.

266
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,880
Nothing is greater than child.

267
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,520
Not fifty one rupees.

268
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,640
The necklace which
is there with your son.

269
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,000
Give that.

270
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,800
Now take your daughter-in-law back.

271
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,400
And give all her jewellery to me.

272
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,240
Father.

273
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,040
I feel.

274
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,480
We have been cheated.

275
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,400
Greetings Bhavani.

276
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,640
Mother!

277
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,160
Grandfather.

278
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,440
Where are you running away?

279
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,200
Please leave me.

280
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,840
I knew.

281
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,880
You will be afraid seeing
this morph of Bhavani.

282
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,760
Once even I had got
the initiation of Bhavani.

283
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,280
My father and grandfather
were great cheaters.

284
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,360
And Bhavani is the
goddess of these people.

285
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,320
Son must choose his father's profession.

286
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,680
This is the tradition.

287
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,520
But my son cheated me.

288
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,360
Hence I have got you here.

289
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,120
Bhavani has chosen you as my heir.

290
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,800
You can't leave me.

291
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,160
Oh Goddess Bhavani.

292
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,920
Oh Goddess Bhavani.

293
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,640
Kundan.

294
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,680
Kundan.

295
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,880
Don't cry.

296
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,600
Don't get upset.

297
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,360
We will search more.

298
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,520
Have searched the whole city.

299
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,760
Couldn't find anywhere.

300
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,000
Where do we go now? Whom to ask?

301
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,160
Shankar's mother.

302
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,640
Are you searching for Shankar?

303
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,560
Has he gone somewhere?

304
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,720
Yes.

305
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,480
Since last night.

306
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,800
But why?

307
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,560
Daughter-in-law,
did you have a fight with him?

308
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,040
You don't worry.

309
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,840
I will ask my men to search him.

310
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,840
And until I find him..

311
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,520
..I will be restless.

312
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,240
Very good.

313
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,600
This way..

314
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,960
..even King Dashrath
must have not gone restless.

315
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,320
Naubatlal.

316
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,920
How dare you step in this house?

317
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,880
To reveal the truth of..

318
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,160
..a cheat person like you.

319
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,720
Do you know this bed sheet?

320
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,760
No.

321
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,440
No.

322
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:13,880
No.

323
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,240
No.

324
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,960
Oh God!

325
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,120
This belongs to Shankar.

326
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,080
Shankar's bed sheet?

327
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,480
Are you sure?

328
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,320
My son.

329
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,600
This is whose blood?

330
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,080
Shankar's blood.

331
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,120
Father killed his son.

332
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,280
Shankar.

333
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,760
He is lying, Shankar's mother.
He is lying.

334
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,880
Please.

335
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,920
Take me to my son.

336
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,920
The bandits of Bhavaniprasad.

337
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,320
Burnt his dead body to ashes.

338
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,600
You rascal.

339
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,680
If my son is been killed.

340
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,280
It must be you who have killed him.

341
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,760
Who gave you the rights?

342
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,160
I got it through destiny.

343
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,400
So that I could tell
the entire Banaras..

344
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,440
..that Bhavaniprasad..

345
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,800
..has killed his own son.

346
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,840
Now even Kundan will know it..

347
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,960
..that you have killed his father.

348
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,120
I will tell him this.

349
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,840
You won't be able to tell this.

350
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,320
Naubatlal,
you won't be able to tell him.

351
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,560
I will not leave you alive for that.

352
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,360
Sir.

353
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,320
I killed the enemy in one shot.

354
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,200
Please forgive me Lord.

355
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,200
How could I leave Naubatlal alive?

356
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,320
He had killed my son.

357
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,720
What happened grandfather?
What has happened to father?

358
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,680
How do I tell you my son?

359
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,520
Naubatlal has killed your father.

360
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,520
Mother.

361
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:31,520
"The flames of anger
kept rising in every house".

362
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:39,000
"It engulfs the world."

363
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:48,360
"The helpless ones who suffer."

364
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:57,120
"Look for support."

365
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,120
Whom can this knife belong to?

366
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,680
Who was it?

367
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,600
Forget him grandfather.

368
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,160
Today again this iron
shield protected me.

369
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,520
Today I feel very proud.

370
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,280
The way you have taught
lesson to the enemies..

371
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,320
..only my successor could do it.

372
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,200
You only made me your successor..

373
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,680
..and even the enemy.

374
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,280
Everything is because of you.

375
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,920
Everyday there are
women who gets widowed.

376
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,600
The children get orphans and
our enemies go on increasing in number.

377
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,000
Those who are powerful have
the maximum number of enemies.

378
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,640
But this is exploitation, this is a sin.

379
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,600
Your religion.

380
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,760
God know how many more
people we need to kill.

381
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,160
I will never be able
to accept this religion.

382
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,120
Kundan.

383
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,880
You will have to accept it.

384
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,840
What you think to be a sin.

385
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,800
Is very powerful.

386
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,080
Once that you get involved in it,
you won't get to leave it ever.

387
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,080
You will see it.

388
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,120
I will definitely involve
you into it before I die.

389
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,760
I just believe in the bond of love,
grandfather

390
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,920
You have involved me in that bond,
otherwise would have left since long.

391
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:43,800
Kundan.

392
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,000
Everyone left you.

393
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,600
Only I am left.

394
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:54,000
I am the one who is with
you this big lonely palace.

395
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,200
God know what kind of curse it is..

396
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,720
..that mother, grandmother,
brothers, sisters all got apart.

397
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:05,000
There is always a deep
silence in this house.

398
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,800
This silence with wither away, Kundan.

399
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,600
Loneliness will vanish.

400
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,240
There will be music here.

401
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,240
I have seen Radheshyam's daughter today.

402
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,720
She is very beautiful.

403
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,520
Just like the moon.

404
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,800
She will drive away
the darkness in your mind.

405
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,760
Kundan.

406
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,440
I will talk to him today.

407
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:29,840
"When heart meets another heart".

408
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:35,400
"Don't ask what happens".

409
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:40,800
"The eyes drop down and
there is silence on the tongue".

410
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:51,920
"When heart meets another heart".

411
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:09,640
"Had seen you once before".

412
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:21,960
"Since that day I have lost my senses".

413
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:27,760
"The love has taken a turn again".

414
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,480
"You are here again in front of me".

415
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:41,280
"Now see which new colours".

416
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:46,840
"Does your glimpse show".

417
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:52,240
"When heart meets another heart".

418
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:08,680
"This youth is sexy and
your body is full of fragrance".

419
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:16,120
"And to add to that is your innocence".

420
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:21,160
"Even your desires are on".

421
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:26,720
"Says your heart beats".

422
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:34,280
"Even you are excited for me".

423
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:39,560
"Your gestures show it".

424
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,840
"When heart meets another heart".

425
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:50,200
"Don't ask what happens".

426
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:07,040
"Don't hide your face with your hand".

427
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:19,400
"Don't exchange the day with night".

428
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:24,720
"Let the melodies spread
out in the garden".

429
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:30,280
"With few sweet words of love'.

430
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:38,000
"Oh Goddess of beauty look at me".

431
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:43,200
"Don't feel shy".

432
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:48,480
"When a heart meets another heart".

433
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:53,520
"Don't ask what happens".

434
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:58,920
"The eyes drop down
and then you get speechless".

435
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:04,360
"There is sweat all over the forehead".

436
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:10,640
"When a heart meets another heart".

437
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,640
Listen.

438
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,920
I haven't seen you
anytime before in Kashi.

439
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,760
I have come here
for visiting the temple.

440
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,760
What is your name?

441
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,560
Poojaran.

442
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,040
Yes. It is in fifteen days.

443
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,440
I'll get my niece married
on that auspicious day.

444
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,040
You've fixed her wedding
even without consulting me.

445
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,080
I have nurtured her with
care even without asking you.

446
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,080
I am her only uncle
in the entire village.

447
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,360
I got married four times but
couldn't be the father even once.

448
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,720
The reason being I wanted
to nurture my sister's child as mine.

449
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,960
You have come here for her marriage?

450
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,600
I know.

451
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,720
Don't worry.

452
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:09,200
I will spend my wealth
for my grand daughter's wedding.

453
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,440
No.

454
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,840
I don't want your loot.
- What did you say?

455
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:16,520
I mean, I have not come here
for wealth only need your obligations.

456
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:20,640
People are so highly obliged by you that
they are not able to come out of it.

457
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,240
I don't want such heavy
obligations from you.

458
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,560
Only a little one.

459
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,120
So that we can breathe.

460
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,320
Please just send Kundan in the wedding.

461
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,640
Only Kundan?

462
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:30,840
And what about me?

463
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,200
I mean my village is not that worth..

464
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,600
..for a great person
like you to come there.

465
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,200
Even your wife and daughter-in-law
have the same opinion.

466
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,680
That these divine footsteps..

467
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,560
..should never leave Kashi.

468
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,080
I understood what they have their mind.

469
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,280
If I go along with Kundan..

470
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,120
..they they won't be
able to grab Kundan from me.

471
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,920
Kundan will not attend
Yashodha's marriage.

472
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,880
Who is Yashodha?

473
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,400
She is..

474
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,560
..you look just the same.

475
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,880
The same stature, the same looks.

476
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:03,480
I am your uncle my dear nephew.

477
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,200
It is so difficult to recognise you.

478
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,880
All your grays have turned black.

479
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,240
And even your mustache has grown big.

480
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,454
I coloured my hair black
for my fourth wedding..

481
00:32:10,534 --> 00:32:12,360
..and grew my mustache after the wedding.

482
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,640
Your new aunty is
also very happy with me.

483
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,960
Okay so tell me what got you here?

484
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,560
Yashodha is getting married.

485
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,480
Yashodha?
- Yes Yashodha.

486
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,080
Our small doll has grown so big.

487
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,440
Did you hear that grandfather?

488
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,000
It is been long time since I have
met my sister, I feel like seeing her.

489
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:30,960
Uncle, when is the wedding?

490
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,800
It is in fifteen days.

491
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,760
We will have a grand marriage
celebration for Yashodha.

492
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,800
We will invite the entire community.
- Kundan.

493
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,720
Yes grandfather.

494
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,600
Don't you want to have my permission
before attending the marriage?

495
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,640
Why?

496
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,000
I am sure you won't give me such a command
which I won't be able to fulfill.

497
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,680
What is it?

498
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,640
We have an invitation.

499
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,760
For Yashodha's wedding.

500
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,320
Is it?

501
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,560
They are your close relatives.

502
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,640
Even Yashodha is like your daughter.

503
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,600
If she gets your
blessing on her wedding..

504
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,880
..then it would be
very prestigious for us.

505
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,240
Along with her wedding I
feel the hobby of having a funeral..

506
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,200
..is something new.

507
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,000
I feel Bhavaniprasad
is no more energetic.

508
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,800
But we haven't yet forgotten
the promise given to our dead father.

509
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,720
That until even a single person
from Bhavaniprasad's family is alive..

510
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,120
..we will not be at ease.

511
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:44,000
Till Bhavaniprasad's men are alive..

512
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,120
..no one can cause
any harm to his family.

513
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,080
Go.

514
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,520
Ask Kundan to test his men.

515
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,480
Over us.

516
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,400
No, you won't go.

517
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,840
We don't have to dig out old enmity.

518
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,080
Dwarka will definitely go.

519
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,480
Yashodha is like our daughter.

520
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,880
And we have blood relations.

521
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,560
And we will definitely
fulfill our duties as relatives.

522
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,760
You go and tell Kundan
that due to business..

523
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,440
..I won't be able to come, but my
younger brother will definitely come..

524
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,080
..to bless the bride.

525
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,440
Okay sir.

526
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,680
Very nice.

527
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,200
First the 'Ras"..

528
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,560
Then said 'gul'.

529
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,960
Very good.

530
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,520
First the 'Ras'

531
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,120
then said 'gul' then said 'le'..

532
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:36,360
..this way she broke the 'rasgulle'
in two pieces. - Wow wonderful.

533
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,480
From where did you get
to drink early in the morning?

534
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:43,760
No, I haven't even had
a drop of alcohol since morning.

535
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:47,120
I have got high seeing her glimpse.

536
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:51,880
She has just arrived
fresh in the garden.

537
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,240
Where did you see her?

538
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,080
I didn't only see her..

539
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,080
..but saw her with proper attention.

540
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,840
But till date I am not sure
if it was the reality or my dream.

541
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:06,400
Next time you carry water along and
splash it on your eyes while seeing her.

542
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,200
Even you started suggesting me.

543
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,000
Laila I haven't seen you before.

544
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,080
But have come here knowing
that Nawab Wajid Ali..

545
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,680
..who has given you the
title of 'Laila of the sky'..

546
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,960
..would be able to do my work.
- Yes tell me.

547
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,920
What can I do for you?

548
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:33,560
I have that people lose
their sense on seeing you.

549
00:35:33,754 --> 00:35:37,354
See how people liking her embarrass her.

550
00:35:37,674 --> 00:35:40,234
We believe God to have various morphs.

551
00:35:40,794 --> 00:35:42,194
Who has many morphs.

552
00:35:43,514 --> 00:35:46,034
What can I cal you Laila, if
I can hear many voices from your side?

553
00:35:46,194 --> 00:35:47,674
I have only one morph.

554
00:35:47,914 --> 00:35:49,594
Don't get confused with the voice.

555
00:35:49,834 --> 00:35:50,474
Say.

556
00:35:50,554 --> 00:35:53,034
I have a very old enmity with a person.

557
00:35:54,514 --> 00:35:56,234
He is my enemy.

558
00:35:57,914 --> 00:36:01,634
I want you to make him your
lover and put him in my feet.

559
00:36:01,714 --> 00:36:02,634
Excuse me.

560
00:36:02,874 --> 00:36:04,354
I do not involve myself
in such contemptible act.

561
00:36:04,434 --> 00:36:06,754
You will be paid a lot for it.

562
00:36:07,114 --> 00:36:07,674
Think over it.

563
00:36:07,754 --> 00:36:10,074
There are many other
such places in the market.

564
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:14,594
Go and buy your required nymph, a
bomb from there who can put him on fire.

565
00:36:15,274 --> 00:36:19,314
He is not affected by the fire.

566
00:36:21,314 --> 00:36:22,594
He is Kundan not only by his name..

567
00:36:24,034 --> 00:36:27,594
Even his deeds.

568
00:36:28,554 --> 00:36:29,354
Anyway.

569
00:36:30,194 --> 00:36:32,314
If you don't like the deal,
there is no use of telling you.

570
00:36:32,834 --> 00:36:35,274
My men are going o his mission..

571
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:39,794
..but I was thinking if he escapes from
them then at least will be trapped by you.

572
00:36:44,074 --> 00:37:04,354
"If my youth gets burnt
in the fire of love".

573
00:37:04,634 --> 00:37:23,514
"Then man is not a big thing,
even the stone would melt".

574
00:37:24,074 --> 00:37:28,274
"Even a stone would melt".

575
00:37:38,314 --> 00:37:47,514
"In a gathering,
everyone thinks me to be theirs".

576
00:37:47,594 --> 00:37:51,154
"Don't ask me about
the world of my gathering".

577
00:37:51,234 --> 00:37:54,754
"Some are flames, some are dews".

578
00:37:54,834 --> 00:37:58,274
"Everyone gets the
glimpse of what they like".

579
00:37:58,354 --> 00:38:01,874
"Everyone gets their
heart satisfied here"..

580
00:38:01,954 --> 00:38:05,474
"Everyone is crazy for my love".

581
00:38:05,554 --> 00:38:09,314
"Everyone is mad for my body".

582
00:38:12,034 --> 00:38:15,914
"Everyone wants to".

583
00:38:16,114 --> 00:38:20,554
"Enjoy my youth".

584
00:38:20,754 --> 00:38:27,074
"They want to see me once".

585
00:38:27,154 --> 00:38:32,954
"They want to see here".

586
00:38:33,074 --> 00:38:39,994
"They want to see there".

587
00:38:41,834 --> 00:38:51,874
"Because in the gathering
everyone thinks I am theirs".

588
00:38:52,034 --> 00:39:00,714
"If I look at one side,
then my lovers get crazy".

589
00:39:01,154 --> 00:39:09,874
"If my body gets burnt
in the fire of love".

590
00:39:09,954 --> 00:39:18,554
"Then humans are nothing
even the stone would melt".

591
00:39:18,634 --> 00:39:22,434
"Then even stones would melt".

592
00:39:27,754 --> 00:39:34,114
"Suddenly if I happen to".

593
00:39:34,194 --> 00:39:36,594
"Life the stole from my face".

594
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:41,194
"There are news on my looks".

595
00:39:41,274 --> 00:39:45,554
"As if there are flowers on the flames".

596
00:39:45,634 --> 00:39:48,914
"Nobody dares to look at me".

597
00:39:51,714 --> 00:40:00,554
"The people with vision,
who say being upset".

598
00:40:00,714 --> 00:40:06,194
"Then I let them speak".

599
00:40:06,274 --> 00:40:12,554
"It is better that'.

600
00:40:12,754 --> 00:40:19,434
"I let my beauty be behind the stole".

601
00:40:20,514 --> 00:40:30,354
"Because suddenly if
I life the stole off my face".

602
00:40:30,434 --> 00:40:38,794
"Someone might lose senses,
some might fall short of breathe".

603
00:40:38,874 --> 00:40:47,114
"If my body gets burnt
in the fire of love".

604
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:55,634
"Then human is nothing
even a stone would melt".

605
00:40:55,714 --> 00:40:59,474
"Even a stone would melt".

606
00:41:10,274 --> 00:41:11,314
Very nice.

607
00:41:12,914 --> 00:41:16,954
If Nawab Wajid Ali Shah wouldn't have
given you the title of 'Laila of the sky".

608
00:41:19,994 --> 00:41:22,794
Then I would have
called you as my darling.

609
00:41:29,394 --> 00:41:31,034
Ganeshiprasad.

610
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:34,234
The one who gambles in the darkness..

611
00:41:34,994 --> 00:41:37,194
..how did you come in
the morning for business?

612
00:41:38,634 --> 00:41:39,474
Well..

613
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:40,794
..look..

614
00:41:41,114 --> 00:41:42,594
..what I have got for you.

615
00:41:45,114 --> 00:41:46,234
Mr. Raja sahab.

616
00:41:49,994 --> 00:41:53,234
From today onwards,
Laila will dance only for Ganeshiprasad.

617
00:41:54,794 --> 00:41:57,874
Will sing only for Ganeshiprasad,
did you understand?

618
00:41:58,794 --> 00:41:59,834
Yes Laila?

619
00:42:01,234 --> 00:42:03,114
You reached little late sir.

620
00:42:03,434 --> 00:42:06,914
The things have already
been decided in the gathering.

621
00:42:07,074 --> 00:42:10,834
The poet has reached now with a broom
to clean the remaining dirt. - Shirt up!

622
00:42:11,674 --> 00:42:13,034
Ganeshiprasad.

623
00:42:13,394 --> 00:42:15,274
You will have to pay for it.

624
00:42:15,554 --> 00:42:18,234
Tell us how much to pay.

625
00:42:18,394 --> 00:42:21,954
Hear some abuses from your lover.

626
00:42:22,194 --> 00:42:23,434
Well said.

627
00:42:24,474 --> 00:42:25,434
Wait.

628
00:42:26,954 --> 00:42:28,794
Make it finer.
- Okay.

629
00:42:29,345 --> 00:42:31,643
Grandma,
I'm going to the confectioner's shop.

630
00:42:31,723 --> 00:42:32,642
How many sweets should I order?

631
00:42:33,274 --> 00:42:37,754
Order sweets and motichoor laddus. Got it?
- Yes, grandma.

632
00:42:43,354 --> 00:42:44,265
Shall I put up the flags, sir?

633
00:42:44,345 --> 00:42:47,434
Stop asking and fill
the courtyard with flags.

634
00:42:47,594 --> 00:42:51,114
I want everything to be perfect
on my niece's wedding. - Okay, sir.

635
00:42:51,474 --> 00:42:54,288
If you want everything to
be perfect then what are you doing here?

636
00:42:54,515 --> 00:42:55,668
Go and do some work.

637
00:42:55,748 --> 00:42:59,074
My fourth wife, where do you want me
to run around in this heat?

638
00:42:59,474 --> 00:43:01,794
You're not a delicate
flower that'll wither away.

639
00:43:02,034 --> 00:43:04,634
Go and check the guests who
were supposed to come from Kolkata.

640
00:43:04,714 --> 00:43:07,034
Go and check if arrangements
of their stay have been made or not. Go.

641
00:43:07,114 --> 00:43:08,954
Why do you always tell me to work?

642
00:43:09,154 --> 00:43:11,594
Don't shout
or I'll expose you before everybody.

643
00:43:11,674 --> 00:43:14,234
Don't expose anything,
keep everything intact.

644
00:43:14,314 --> 00:43:16,354
It'll help in the wedding.

645
00:43:17,354 --> 00:43:18,714
Go.
- Okay.

646
00:43:32,474 --> 00:43:35,274
My child,
don't cry on this auspicious day.

647
00:43:35,794 --> 00:43:38,432
Grandma, what about Kundan brother?
- He'll definitely come.

648
00:43:38,605 --> 00:43:42,394
He'll definitely come.
There's still time. I'm sure he'll come.

649
00:43:42,874 --> 00:43:46,434
Grandma, I heard that
Kundan has arrived at the banks.

650
00:43:46,514 --> 00:43:47,634
Brother Kundan!

651
00:43:59,674 --> 00:44:02,394
Uncle Bhim,
look at the antics of the bride.

652
00:44:02,594 --> 00:44:05,434
She has left her wedding
rituals to come and meet her brother.

653
00:44:06,074 --> 00:44:07,834
Brother Kundan!

654
00:44:09,074 --> 00:44:10,594
You made me wait so long.

655
00:44:10,754 --> 00:44:12,554
I had lost all hopes
that you would come.

656
00:44:12,714 --> 00:44:15,794
Stupid girl!
How could you get married without me?

657
00:44:16,514 --> 00:44:20,394
I told mother that I wouldn't
sit in the palanquin until you come.

658
00:44:20,474 --> 00:44:23,394
Kundan, my son!
- Mother. - Kundan.

659
00:44:24,474 --> 00:44:28,394
You haven't enquired about
your mother for so many years.

660
00:44:28,714 --> 00:44:31,434
I always missed and
thought about you, mother.

661
00:44:32,194 --> 00:44:34,754
I was alive only to see you.

662
00:44:34,954 --> 00:44:37,514
Now that you've come back
I'll not let you go away from me.

663
00:44:37,594 --> 00:44:40,265
Did you see my nephew?
He has arrived on time for the wedding.

664
00:44:40,345 --> 00:44:41,967
Uncle.
- Bless you.

665
00:44:42,226 --> 00:44:44,314
Uncle, you didn't have any child.

666
00:44:45,074 --> 00:44:46,834
Have you adopted this girl?

667
00:44:47,034 --> 00:44:49,168
Oh no! What are you saying my nephew?

668
00:44:49,248 --> 00:44:51,634
Why do you think that
my wife is my daughter?

669
00:44:51,714 --> 00:44:53,212
She's your aunt.
- I made a mistake.

670
00:44:53,292 --> 00:44:56,434
Fourth one. Seek her blessings.
- Let me touch your feet, aunt.

671
00:44:58,114 --> 00:45:00,994
So, the uncle and nephew have met.

672
00:45:01,074 --> 00:45:04,114
Let's go and enjoy some drinks.

673
00:45:22,114 --> 00:45:28,834
"I've a carefree heart."

674
00:45:29,194 --> 00:45:33,554
"I'm a colourful person."

675
00:45:38,114 --> 00:45:44,074
"To celebrate today's occasion,
brother.."

676
00:45:45,114 --> 00:45:49,474
"..I've drunk a little."

677
00:46:00,074 --> 00:46:14,914
"Make me wear anklets
and watch my movements."

678
00:46:14,994 --> 00:46:17,114
"Wonderful, brother."

679
00:46:17,194 --> 00:46:25,234
"Dress me in the red
scarf and watch my movements."

680
00:46:25,434 --> 00:46:31,794
"Make me wear anklets
and watch my movements."

681
00:46:31,874 --> 00:46:33,754
"Your movements are so graceful."

682
00:46:33,834 --> 00:46:36,434
"Dance, beautiful lady."

683
00:46:49,354 --> 00:46:53,194
"Somebody's nose ring sways."

684
00:46:53,274 --> 00:46:57,394
"Somebody's earrings dance."

685
00:46:57,914 --> 00:47:04,954
"Everybody will hold their
breath when they watch me sway my hips."

686
00:47:05,034 --> 00:47:07,074
"How?
- Like this."

687
00:47:09,914 --> 00:47:14,154
"When the wedding
of somebody is fixed.."

688
00:47:14,234 --> 00:47:18,314
"..my youth wakes up."

689
00:47:18,394 --> 00:47:21,914
"My youth wakes up."

690
00:47:21,994 --> 00:47:27,594
"Somebody please get me married."

691
00:47:27,674 --> 00:47:30,434
"And then watch my movements."

692
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:37,074
"Make me wear anklets
and watch my movements."

693
00:47:45,754 --> 00:47:53,914
"Somebody attracts with her eyes
while the other one steals the heart."

694
00:47:54,274 --> 00:48:01,274
"The eyes of the third
one rob those who look at them."

695
00:48:02,754 --> 00:48:06,514
"The world is crazy for you."

696
00:48:06,594 --> 00:48:14,314
"Let me behold the
beauty of your youth."

697
00:48:14,394 --> 00:48:19,874
"Remove the veil
from your face and.."

698
00:48:19,954 --> 00:48:22,674
"..and watch my movements."

699
00:48:22,834 --> 00:48:30,914
"Dress me in a red
scarf and watch my movements."

700
00:48:31,114 --> 00:48:37,634
"Make me wear anklets
and watch my movements."

701
00:50:06,594 --> 00:50:09,954
You're Kundan. Right?
- Yes.

702
00:50:11,074 --> 00:50:13,194
Who are you? How did you come inside?

703
00:50:14,234 --> 00:50:16,234
The doors opened to welcome me.

704
00:50:17,994 --> 00:50:20,114
I'm Naubatlal's son. Dwarka.

705
00:50:22,154 --> 00:50:25,594
Brother, it's you. When did you come?

706
00:50:26,634 --> 00:50:29,674
A little while ago.
- I waited for you till late in the night.

707
00:50:30,274 --> 00:50:32,194
I hope you've no problem
where you've been asked to stay.

708
00:50:32,394 --> 00:50:35,594
I'm comfortable there.
But, there's one problem.

709
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:39,994
What? - How can I enjoy drinks alone?
- That's not possible.

710
00:50:40,194 --> 00:50:42,274
I'll give you company.
I'll make arrangements.

711
00:50:43,634 --> 00:50:46,346
Arrangements have been made.
Come with me.

712
00:50:46,426 --> 00:50:47,931
That's not done.

713
00:50:48,011 --> 00:50:48,882
You've come to my place
for the first time.

714
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:51,234
The first meeting should in my house.
Right?

715
00:50:51,394 --> 00:50:53,474
Are you scared to go with your enemy?

716
00:50:54,674 --> 00:50:57,086
No. I'm not scared of my enemy.

717
00:50:57,166 --> 00:50:58,634
I was concerned about my guest.

718
00:51:00,234 --> 00:51:01,274
Come with me.

719
00:51:11,194 --> 00:51:13,594
Two and half steps of the horse.

720
00:51:16,034 --> 00:51:17,034
Save yourself.

721
00:51:23,474 --> 00:51:25,514
You're very smart.

722
00:51:27,394 --> 00:51:28,994
Your moves are very smart.

723
00:51:35,394 --> 00:51:41,034
I'll play such moves that
it'll be difficult for you to escape.

724
00:51:42,954 --> 00:51:48,514
Just wait and watch
how my soldiers surround you.

725
00:52:01,954 --> 00:52:03,154
Get a new glass of drink.

726
00:52:42,154 --> 00:52:43,874
What are you thinking, Kundan?

727
00:52:47,874 --> 00:52:52,554
This will enter
your house without force.

728
00:52:53,394 --> 00:52:54,994
You won't be able to escape.

729
00:52:59,394 --> 00:53:00,954
Do you know him?

730
00:53:10,234 --> 00:53:12,794
He's the one who
attacked you in Banaras.

731
00:53:13,954 --> 00:53:15,114
Do you remember the incident?

732
00:53:16,594 --> 00:53:18,674
The attack came from behind that day.

733
00:53:20,714 --> 00:53:24,710
You had worn a protective
iron gear that day and so you escaped.

734
00:53:29,754 --> 00:53:31,954
But, today I'm wearing silk shirt.

735
00:53:35,381 --> 00:53:37,314
And I'm also drunk.

736
00:53:40,394 --> 00:53:42,394
Drink more. More.

737
00:54:08,314 --> 00:54:13,274
Kundan, everything is fair in enmity.

738
00:54:15,034 --> 00:54:18,634
To avenge the death
of his forefathers..

739
00:54:19,554 --> 00:54:21,634
..is the duty of a child.

740
00:54:24,514 --> 00:54:25,594
Isn't it?

741
00:54:26,074 --> 00:54:28,154
My approval doesn't matter, brother.

742
00:54:30,594 --> 00:54:33,354
The fruits of the seeds
of enmity sown my our ancestors..

743
00:54:35,514 --> 00:54:37,674
..has to be borne by us.

744
00:54:40,114 --> 00:54:41,154
Play the next move.

745
00:54:44,194 --> 00:54:46,714
I've already made my move.

746
00:54:51,434 --> 00:54:53,954
I've won the game.

747
00:55:14,674 --> 00:55:18,914
He lost the game while trying to win.

748
00:55:20,314 --> 00:55:22,074
Uncle Bhim,
go and check what happened.

749
00:55:27,114 --> 00:55:38,794
"When heart meets another heart".

750
00:55:45,354 --> 00:55:46,954
So, you've come to challenge me.

751
00:55:48,314 --> 00:55:50,674
You tried to act smart.

752
00:55:51,314 --> 00:55:54,994
It's time to get lost. Go.

753
00:56:24,914 --> 00:56:26,633
I saw her from head to toe.

754
00:56:29,001 --> 00:56:30,612
Now there's neither
her head nor toe here.

755
00:56:35,541 --> 00:56:38,752
Long live Dwarka!
You've served a wonderful drink.

756
00:56:39,942 --> 00:56:42,586
I visualized the woman I was dreaming of.

757
00:56:43,639 --> 00:56:45,000
What if she comes before you in person?

758
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:51,714
I'll embrace her immediately.
Who spoke just now?

759
00:56:57,594 --> 00:57:00,994
Dwaraka,
you served a wonderful drink.

760
00:57:01,554 --> 00:57:04,754
Now I can hear her voice too.

761
00:57:05,354 --> 00:57:06,874
Long live, Dwarka!

762
00:57:08,154 --> 00:57:10,554
You've served a wonderful drink.

763
00:57:11,074 --> 00:57:16,994
The woman I was dreaming
of has appeared before me.

764
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,434
Now that you're
here I won't let you go.

765
00:57:21,234 --> 00:57:28,754
You've to tell me your name and address.
You've to share everything with me.

766
00:57:29,634 --> 00:57:31,034
Tell me, beautiful lady.

767
00:58:08,154 --> 00:58:08,845
You?

768
00:58:10,196 --> 00:58:14,714
Are you Munni?
- Yes.

769
00:58:55,074 --> 00:58:56,434
He is been fed with poison.

770
00:58:56,594 --> 00:58:57,954
What?

771
00:59:24,794 --> 00:59:26,194
How is Dwarka?

772
00:59:26,794 --> 00:59:27,954
He is safe.

773
01:00:39,874 --> 01:00:41,034
I have come here for the wedding.

774
01:00:42,554 --> 01:00:45,434
Coming here you have
shown us great respect.

775
01:00:46,354 --> 01:00:47,634
We are very grateful to you.

776
01:00:49,154 --> 01:00:51,114
And now while leaving
don't keep any grudges.

777
01:00:51,194 --> 01:00:53,074
No grudges.

778
01:00:54,074 --> 01:00:56,234
There is a thirst in mind since long.

779
01:00:57,114 --> 01:00:58,994
Which I want to get satisfied someday.

780
01:01:00,314 --> 01:01:02,154
Our guest is returning
back remaining thirsty..

781
01:01:03,394 --> 01:01:04,714
..this is going to make us unhappy.

782
01:01:04,794 --> 01:01:06,354
We will talk in Banaras.

783
01:01:07,314 --> 01:01:08,594
I will wait for you.

784
01:01:11,354 --> 01:01:13,874
Even there you won't find
anything missing while we greet you.

785
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:19,074
I am leaving grandmother.

786
01:01:20,594 --> 01:01:21,834
Stay alive son.

787
01:01:26,554 --> 01:01:27,474
Thank you.

788
01:01:28,314 --> 01:01:30,034
Mr. Dwarka.

789
01:01:30,549 --> 01:01:32,474
How can I help you?

790
01:01:35,714 --> 01:01:36,994
I am leaving.

791
01:01:38,554 --> 01:01:40,794
Without taking your revenge?

792
01:01:40,914 --> 01:01:42,994
Now this game..

793
01:01:43,674 --> 01:01:45,394
..will be played in Banaras.

794
01:01:45,714 --> 01:01:47,234
It is difficult.

795
01:01:48,034 --> 01:01:51,074
The destiny is with
the enemies at each step.

796
01:01:52,474 --> 01:01:56,914
He got saved by the attack of the knife.

797
01:01:58,594 --> 01:02:01,194
I will wait for you in Banaras.

798
01:02:02,594 --> 01:02:06,154
You try to influence
Kundan by showing him love..

799
01:02:07,194 --> 01:02:08,354
..and get him to Banaras.

800
01:02:10,514 --> 01:02:12,314
If while influencing him..

801
01:02:12,714 --> 01:02:14,194
..what if I happen to fall for him?

802
01:02:16,914 --> 01:02:21,074
I know about your profession very well.

803
01:02:22,394 --> 01:02:24,074
You are making a mistake Mr. Dwarka.

804
01:02:24,634 --> 01:02:26,674
The game of love is double edged sword.

805
01:02:27,394 --> 01:02:29,594
The player can himself get injured.

806
01:02:32,434 --> 01:02:36,354
Player gets injured if he is stupid.

807
01:02:38,354 --> 01:02:39,594
This beauty..

808
01:02:43,514 --> 01:02:45,114
..this youth..

809
01:02:48,154 --> 01:02:49,194
..these gestures..

810
01:02:49,994 --> 01:02:50,994
..not only Kundan..

811
01:02:51,834 --> 01:02:53,314
..even angles will fall for you.

812
01:02:55,954 --> 01:02:56,994
Is it?

813
01:02:59,554 --> 01:03:00,834
When I see you..

814
01:03:02,514 --> 01:03:04,474
..I lose my senses.

815
01:03:09,194 --> 01:03:11,074
You set a fire.

816
01:03:17,394 --> 01:03:19,874
Even your brother had held this hand.

817
01:03:21,714 --> 01:03:22,674
Really.

818
01:03:23,994 --> 01:03:26,914
Try to get Kundan
to Banaras at earliest.

819
01:03:28,474 --> 01:03:31,114
And what if I get him somewhere else?

820
01:03:31,674 --> 01:03:33,114
This cannot happen.

821
01:03:33,714 --> 01:03:34,754
Really?

822
01:03:43,554 --> 01:03:44,434
Then?

823
01:03:47,034 --> 01:03:49,794
Since then mother and grandmother
along with Yashodha and Gopal..

824
01:03:50,434 --> 01:03:52,234
..are here with my uncle.

825
01:03:53,794 --> 01:03:56,674
I stay with my grandfather in Banaras.

826
01:03:57,674 --> 01:03:58,994
All stay at different places.

827
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:01,234
I do not like it.

828
01:04:02,434 --> 01:04:04,274
I can understand your sorrow.

829
01:04:05,674 --> 01:04:07,594
Why will you be in sorrow?

830
01:04:08,594 --> 01:04:10,194
Tell me about yourself.

831
01:04:13,514 --> 01:04:14,354
I will.

832
01:04:14,634 --> 01:04:15,514
When?

833
01:04:16,674 --> 01:04:18,594
Some other time.
- No, today.

834
01:04:19,554 --> 01:04:21,474
I have many questions in my mind.

835
01:04:22,354 --> 01:04:24,314
How and where you lived?

836
01:04:24,394 --> 01:04:25,914
How were you nurtured?

837
01:04:28,754 --> 01:04:29,554
Think..

838
01:04:29,954 --> 01:04:31,674
..I was in hell away from you.

839
01:04:37,594 --> 01:04:40,154
Now being close to you,
I reached the heaven.

840
01:04:41,394 --> 01:04:43,474
Now, don't remind me those days of hell.

841
01:04:43,754 --> 01:04:46,874
I want your sorrows too
along with your happiness.

842
01:04:48,274 --> 01:04:50,874
And there should be
no secrets in between us.

843
01:04:52,074 --> 01:04:53,754
Is this not enough for you..

844
01:04:54,314 --> 01:04:56,194
..that every moment..

845
01:04:56,514 --> 01:04:58,314
..I was lost in your thoughts.

846
01:04:58,954 --> 01:05:01,674
It was your thoughts
which got me close to you.

847
01:05:16,674 --> 01:05:17,794
You have a long life.

848
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:19,114
You are home.

849
01:05:20,074 --> 01:05:22,314
You are not worried for your meals.

850
01:05:22,394 --> 01:05:24,714
Why do make your mother wait for you?

851
01:05:24,954 --> 01:05:26,994
Mother keeps getting excited.

852
01:05:27,074 --> 01:05:30,274
You give me such heavy breakfast that I
do not feel hungry for the rest of the day.

853
01:05:30,474 --> 01:05:32,274
But you feel thirsty, nephew. Right?

854
01:05:33,274 --> 01:05:34,394
Thirsty.

855
01:05:34,554 --> 01:05:36,714
Where do you stay out for long?

856
01:05:37,154 --> 01:05:39,514
I was in the farms.

857
01:05:39,634 --> 01:05:40,634
Near the mango garden.

858
01:05:40,714 --> 01:05:42,074
I like it there.

859
01:05:42,194 --> 01:05:43,794
There is nice breeze there.

860
01:05:43,874 --> 01:05:46,274
The birds keep chirping.

861
01:05:46,634 --> 01:05:49,354
The sweetest sound is of the cuckoo.

862
01:05:49,794 --> 01:05:51,114
Cuckoo, cuckoo.

863
01:05:51,434 --> 01:05:52,474
Did you find any?

864
01:05:53,114 --> 01:05:55,354
No, not here.

865
01:05:55,434 --> 01:05:57,474
Here there are all parrots.

866
01:05:57,554 --> 01:05:59,114
Parrots?

867
01:06:02,594 --> 01:06:03,874
Where did this come from?

868
01:06:05,514 --> 01:06:07,914
The hair which is so long.

869
01:06:08,634 --> 01:06:11,114
Grandmother had hugged me.

870
01:06:11,194 --> 01:06:12,434
Grandmother?

871
01:06:12,794 --> 01:06:13,914
Listen.

872
01:06:14,354 --> 01:06:17,034
All your hair have turned white.

873
01:06:17,194 --> 01:06:20,474
Nephew has got this hair
black by roaming in the sun.

874
01:06:24,354 --> 01:06:25,634
Don't hide from your mother.

875
01:06:26,034 --> 01:06:26,754
Tell us.

876
01:06:27,274 --> 01:06:29,034
Tell, isn't there some girl?

877
01:06:59,234 --> 01:07:05,274
"This love is crazy
and the body is wounded".

878
01:07:05,594 --> 01:07:11,074
"Love is crazy and the body is wounded".

879
01:07:11,194 --> 01:07:16,674
"There is a heart filled
with emotions at both the ends.

880
01:07:16,754 --> 01:07:22,274
"Don't ask me the
condition of my heart."

881
01:07:22,354 --> 01:07:27,514
"Don't ask me the amount
of restlessness of my heart."

882
01:07:27,714 --> 01:07:32,994
"The amount of restlessness is there,
is here too".

883
01:07:33,074 --> 01:07:36,074
"Crazy love".

884
01:07:47,394 --> 01:07:52,714
"Our stories, the songs of my heart".

885
01:07:52,794 --> 01:07:58,234
"Either you understand
or I will know them".

886
01:07:58,314 --> 01:08:03,514
"You know about my heart".

887
01:08:03,594 --> 01:08:09,074
"I know about your heart'.

888
01:08:09,154 --> 01:08:14,514
"Love is crazy and the body is wounded".

889
01:08:14,594 --> 01:08:17,714
"Love is crazy".

890
01:08:24,674 --> 01:08:30,114
"Your hair are messed
up and the stole is falling."

891
01:08:30,274 --> 01:08:35,234
"There is a smile on your lips".

892
01:08:35,554 --> 01:08:40,834
"I am lost in love, but".

893
01:08:40,914 --> 01:08:46,314
"Today even you are lost today".

894
01:08:46,394 --> 01:08:56,914
"Don't ask about the
amount of restlessness".

895
01:08:56,994 --> 01:09:02,154
"The amount of restlessness is here,
is there too".

896
01:09:02,714 --> 01:09:04,834
"Love is crazy".

897
01:09:16,034 --> 01:09:21,314
"Moon and the stars
and the beautiful sights".

898
01:09:21,394 --> 01:09:26,314
"Shouldn't take away your beauty".

899
01:09:26,594 --> 01:09:31,874
"Keep your body protected from others".

900
01:09:31,954 --> 01:09:37,194
"Look everyone has an eye up on you".

901
01:09:37,274 --> 01:09:47,874
"Love is crazy and the body is wounded".

902
01:09:48,034 --> 01:09:53,194
"At both the ends there
is a heart filled with emotions".

903
01:09:53,274 --> 01:09:58,474
"Don't ask me about the
restlessness of the heart".

904
01:09:58,554 --> 01:10:03,714
"the way it is here, it is there too".

905
01:10:03,914 --> 01:10:05,994
"Love is crazy".

906
01:10:12,474 --> 01:10:13,714
Mr, Lalchand.

907
01:10:14,074 --> 01:10:16,354
I cannot understand you at all.

908
01:10:16,634 --> 01:10:18,234
What do you want to say?

909
01:10:18,314 --> 01:10:20,354
I want to say many things.

910
01:10:20,514 --> 01:10:22,834
But you are not trying to understand.

911
01:10:23,274 --> 01:10:23,954
Think.

912
01:10:24,314 --> 01:10:25,114
Think.

913
01:10:25,434 --> 01:10:26,674
It is a lovely night
full of stars in the sky.

914
01:10:26,874 --> 01:10:27,914
Lovely night.

915
01:10:28,194 --> 01:10:29,674
There is a sea shore.

916
01:10:29,754 --> 01:10:30,954
A Sea shore.

917
01:10:31,034 --> 01:10:33,754
We both are sitting close to each other.

918
01:10:33,834 --> 01:10:34,394
Why?

919
01:10:34,754 --> 01:10:35,394
Mean?

920
01:10:35,474 --> 01:10:36,954
Why are we sitting?

921
01:10:37,074 --> 01:10:38,634
Okay, we are not sitting,
we are standing.

922
01:10:38,754 --> 01:10:39,514
Standing.

923
01:10:39,634 --> 01:10:41,754
I take your hand in mine.

924
01:10:41,834 --> 01:10:42,394
How?

925
01:10:42,634 --> 01:10:43,474
Like this.

926
01:10:43,674 --> 01:10:45,394
And while doing that I say

927
01:10:46,194 --> 01:10:48,274
Nawab wajid Ali Shah..

928
01:10:48,874 --> 01:10:51,834
...if wouldn't have given
you the title of 'Laila of the sky'..

929
01:10:52,394 --> 01:10:53,474
..then I would have..

930
01:10:53,674 --> 01:10:55,554
..called you as darling.

931
01:10:57,994 --> 01:11:02,194
There was no need of such a
big story for a simple kiss on my hand.

932
01:11:02,554 --> 01:11:05,154
The one who really wants
to kiss on hand do it quickly.

933
01:11:07,054 --> 01:11:07,814
Got it?

934
01:11:10,534 --> 01:11:11,374
Yes.

935
01:11:13,534 --> 01:11:17,534
What a scene.

936
01:11:17,734 --> 01:11:20,094
Did you see that?

937
01:11:20,174 --> 01:11:21,974
What do you mean?

938
01:11:22,054 --> 01:11:26,054
The one who falls from
the sky and hangs on the tree.

939
01:11:26,134 --> 01:11:31,334
Oh, that is the reason you keep waiting
here even if Laila is not around.

940
01:11:31,414 --> 01:11:33,694
Sorry sir.

941
01:11:33,854 --> 01:11:37,014
Even you have come here in here absence.

942
01:11:38,614 --> 01:11:40,014
Yes you are right.

943
01:11:40,854 --> 01:11:42,374
Her memories have got me here.

944
01:11:43,134 --> 01:11:45,494
I was getting eager to see her face.

945
01:11:45,574 --> 01:11:48,334
I thought there must be some picture
of her over here hence came to see it.

946
01:11:50,014 --> 01:11:52,134
I can't live a moment without Laila.

947
01:11:54,094 --> 01:11:55,814
I've brought a new mansion.

948
01:11:57,054 --> 01:11:58,454
Once Laila comes back..

949
01:11:59,894 --> 01:12:01,974
..I'll marry her and take her home.

950
01:12:12,974 --> 01:12:14,534
Grandmother she is the girl.

951
01:12:27,734 --> 01:12:29,614
You wanted to meet
her hence got her here.

952
01:12:29,974 --> 01:12:32,334
Even if you keep seeing
her for the whole life..

953
01:12:33,294 --> 01:12:34,974
..still will remain unsatisfied.

954
01:12:36,654 --> 01:12:38,334
She is the magic of Lord.

955
01:12:39,454 --> 01:12:40,574
Yes mother.

956
01:12:42,454 --> 01:12:43,854
It is a magic.

957
01:12:46,174 --> 01:12:48,934
She looks as if some Goddess
has descended from the heaven.

958
01:12:50,854 --> 01:12:53,174
To get us out of our sorrows.

959
01:12:55,294 --> 01:12:56,054
Girl.

960
01:12:57,814 --> 01:12:59,054
Everyone says.

961
01:13:01,054 --> 01:13:03,894
Kundan's mother has gone
crazy due to her sorrows.

962
01:13:05,974 --> 01:13:07,494
Now that you have come.

963
01:13:07,734 --> 01:13:09,214
I will get alright.

964
01:13:09,574 --> 01:13:11,014
Completely alright.

965
01:13:12,494 --> 01:13:13,134
Only thing is..

966
01:13:14,174 --> 01:13:15,534
..I want happiness.

967
01:13:18,774 --> 01:13:20,534
I want my son back.

968
01:13:20,614 --> 01:13:23,174
it is because of you that
Kundan has still not gone to Banaras.

969
01:13:23,494 --> 01:13:25,494
You stay with us as his wife.

970
01:13:25,614 --> 01:13:27,734
Then even he will stay
with us for all his life.

971
01:13:28,254 --> 01:13:29,974
We will keep you as a queen.

972
01:13:30,054 --> 01:13:30,614
Yes.

973
01:13:30,734 --> 01:13:32,374
You will rule in this house.

974
01:13:32,894 --> 01:13:34,334
You deserve that.

975
01:13:35,014 --> 01:13:36,054
Your face shows that..

976
01:13:36,534 --> 01:13:38,094
..you belong to a very
prestigious community.

977
01:13:40,054 --> 01:13:41,094
Mother..

978
01:13:41,494 --> 01:13:42,774
Say a yes.

979
01:13:43,614 --> 01:13:45,174
Are you shy to say that?

980
01:13:46,174 --> 01:13:47,254
What to do girl?

981
01:13:48,614 --> 01:13:50,094
We have to talk to you.

982
01:13:51,054 --> 01:13:53,414
Kundan told us you do not have parents.

983
01:13:53,494 --> 01:13:54,654
Why not?

984
01:13:55,774 --> 01:13:57,294
I am her mother.

985
01:13:58,614 --> 01:14:00,294
By getting Yashodha married..

986
01:14:00,974 --> 01:14:03,454
..I was getting restless
for a girl child.

987
01:14:04,334 --> 01:14:06,334
But looking at her I am at peace.

988
01:14:07,574 --> 01:14:10,294
I will always love you girl.

989
01:14:11,054 --> 01:14:12,454
Just say a yes.

990
01:14:12,774 --> 01:14:15,094
Say a yes.

991
01:14:15,774 --> 01:14:16,774
No.

992
01:14:16,974 --> 01:14:18,254
Forgive me.

993
01:14:18,574 --> 01:14:20,174
Please forgive me.

994
01:14:22,614 --> 01:14:23,494
What happened?

995
01:14:23,574 --> 01:14:25,094
Why are you crying?

996
01:14:25,454 --> 01:14:26,774
What has happened to you girl?

997
01:14:27,654 --> 01:14:28,494
Say what happened?

998
01:14:28,854 --> 01:14:31,254
Share your sorrows with your mother.

999
01:14:31,334 --> 01:14:33,734
How to tell you mother?

1000
01:14:33,894 --> 01:14:36,054
How will she speak?

1001
01:14:41,054 --> 01:14:43,254
After acquiring the Goddess title..

1002
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:46,214
..how can she tell you
that she is a prostitute.

1003
01:14:46,574 --> 01:14:47,494
Grandfather.

1004
01:14:47,574 --> 01:14:48,894
Are you surprised?

1005
01:14:49,374 --> 01:14:50,294
And there is more..

1006
01:14:50,894 --> 01:14:52,654
..she is not only a prostitute..

1007
01:14:52,974 --> 01:14:54,774
..but she is been sent
to you by the enemies.

1008
01:14:55,054 --> 01:14:56,454
Dwarka has left her here..

1009
01:14:56,534 --> 01:14:59,774
..so that she can trap you with her beauty
and hand you over to your enemies.

1010
01:14:59,854 --> 01:15:01,614
Enough grandfather,
do not speak a single word.

1011
01:15:02,694 --> 01:15:04,334
Otherwise even I would say something..

1012
01:15:05,254 --> 01:15:06,934
..which will hurt yourself respect.

1013
01:15:07,174 --> 01:15:07,934
Kundan.

1014
01:15:08,014 --> 01:15:09,614
I respect you a lot grandfather.

1015
01:15:09,974 --> 01:15:11,654
But I will not give you the rights..

1016
01:15:12,094 --> 01:15:13,694
..to disrespect Munni this way.

1017
01:15:13,934 --> 01:15:16,014
She is pure like the river Ganga.

1018
01:15:17,894 --> 01:15:18,574
Munni.

1019
01:15:19,574 --> 01:15:20,334
Munni.

1020
01:15:21,014 --> 01:15:22,534
Do not mind his words.

1021
01:15:23,494 --> 01:15:25,774
I know you since childhood,
you are a nice girl.

1022
01:15:26,254 --> 01:15:27,654
I trust you.

1023
01:15:29,014 --> 01:15:29,934
I trust you completely.

1024
01:15:30,054 --> 01:15:32,174
You trust this bitch.

1025
01:15:32,494 --> 01:15:33,894
And do not trust me?

1026
01:15:34,214 --> 01:15:36,494
Then ask her, if you trust her.

1027
01:15:36,654 --> 01:15:38,894
Whether her mother's
name is Champa or not.

1028
01:15:43,094 --> 01:15:45,854
Wasn't she a prostitute
at Nawab Wajid Ali Shah's court?

1029
01:15:51,814 --> 01:15:52,934
Ask her.

1030
01:15:53,534 --> 01:15:56,374
Who is the famous dancer of Calcutta?

1031
01:15:56,774 --> 01:15:59,294
Nawab has given him the
title of 'Laila of the sky'.

1032
01:16:02,214 --> 01:16:04,974
The poisonous snake is
front of you stupid person.

1033
01:16:05,334 --> 01:16:07,254
She has come here to bite you.

1034
01:16:07,494 --> 01:16:08,534
Munni.

1035
01:16:08,974 --> 01:16:10,894
tell him that all this is not true.

1036
01:16:11,414 --> 01:16:12,574
Tell him.

1037
01:16:13,334 --> 01:16:14,454
Come here.

1038
01:16:16,334 --> 01:16:19,694
Tell him that all these
allegations are false.

1039
01:16:21,894 --> 01:16:22,814
Say Munni.

1040
01:16:23,454 --> 01:16:24,774
Why are you quiet?

1041
01:16:25,734 --> 01:16:28,054
What will mother think?

1042
01:16:28,734 --> 01:16:29,974
What will grandmother think?

1043
01:16:31,054 --> 01:16:33,214
What will everyone say?

1044
01:16:33,374 --> 01:16:35,694
Whom have I got as
their daughter-in-law?

1045
01:16:37,374 --> 01:16:39,934
You have to get rid off
these allegations upon you.

1046
01:16:40,294 --> 01:16:41,814
Answer him Munni.

1047
01:16:49,174 --> 01:16:49,854
Munni.

1048
01:16:50,734 --> 01:16:52,054
Why don't you have any answer?

1049
01:16:53,134 --> 01:16:55,014
Whatever grandfather said, is it true?

1050
01:16:55,574 --> 01:16:56,334
Munni.

1051
01:16:56,774 --> 01:16:59,974
Is it true that Ganga's
daughter is a prostitute at Kashi?

1052
01:17:00,494 --> 01:17:02,614
Is it true or love was fake?

1053
01:17:02,694 --> 01:17:04,814
And you are along with my enemies?

1054
01:17:05,014 --> 01:17:09,054
Is it true that making me fall in love with
you was a way to drive me towards death?

1055
01:17:09,134 --> 01:17:12,374
I don't want to hear
my name from your bad mouth.

1056
01:17:12,974 --> 01:17:15,694
Why didn't I understand
about you before?

1057
01:17:17,134 --> 01:17:19,494
After meeting you,
Ganeshi's men had attacked me..

1058
01:17:20,574 --> 01:17:22,054
..you had sent them there.

1059
01:17:22,334 --> 01:17:23,414
No Kundan.

1060
01:17:23,494 --> 01:17:24,814
Go away from here.

1061
01:17:26,014 --> 01:17:27,614
You're a woman so I've spared you.

1062
01:17:28,174 --> 01:17:30,294
If there was some other person,
I would have beaten him.

1063
01:17:30,894 --> 01:17:31,894
Listen to me.

1064
01:17:32,094 --> 01:17:33,174
You sinner lady.

1065
01:17:33,454 --> 01:17:35,094
Didn't you hear what he said?

1066
01:17:35,254 --> 01:17:36,374
Get out from here.

1067
01:17:36,854 --> 01:17:39,934
I will pull your tongue out
if you take Kundan's name again.

1068
01:17:40,014 --> 01:17:46,014
Get out.
- Kundan.

1069
01:17:57,334 --> 01:18:00,854
If I wanted,
I could have killed you in to pieces.

1070
01:18:01,654 --> 01:18:03,494
But I m leaving you alive.

1071
01:18:03,774 --> 01:18:04,694
Only because..

1072
01:18:05,174 --> 01:18:07,254
..the cowards who have sent you here..

1073
01:18:07,494 --> 01:18:08,774
..go and tell them.

1074
01:18:09,134 --> 01:18:12,814
..if they have the guts
to take revenge from Bhavaniprasad..

1075
01:18:13,174 --> 01:18:15,574
..instead of taking
the support of a woman..

1076
01:18:15,654 --> 01:18:16,894
..come in front and attack me.

1077
01:18:17,414 --> 01:18:18,614
Bhavaniprasad.

1078
01:18:19,334 --> 01:18:20,974
Bhavaniprasad.

1079
01:18:21,614 --> 01:18:24,334
You have hurt a woman's emotions..

1080
01:18:25,374 --> 01:18:27,094
..I wasn't a prostitute today.

1081
01:18:27,174 --> 01:18:29,894
Now I will show you
what a prostitute is.

1082
01:18:30,414 --> 01:18:33,894
I will take a revenge
of this humiliation.

1083
01:18:33,974 --> 01:18:36,374
I will take a revenge.

1084
01:18:36,694 --> 01:18:37,974
I will.

1085
01:18:39,054 --> 01:18:40,814
I will.

1086
01:19:02,134 --> 01:19:04,894
A man bitten by a snake
doesn't get time to ask for water.

1087
01:19:05,374 --> 01:19:09,174
It's been four days that Mr. Bhawani
Prasad was attacked but he's still alive.

1088
01:19:09,374 --> 01:19:11,214
He's a pious man.

1089
01:19:11,294 --> 01:19:13,734
I've heard that he's
revered by everybody in Banaras.

1090
01:19:14,334 --> 01:19:15,454
Gopal.

1091
01:19:16,254 --> 01:19:18,294
Please let us
behold your grandfather.

1092
01:19:18,374 --> 01:19:19,814
Uncle, that's not possible.

1093
01:19:20,014 --> 01:19:23,374
Grandfather isn't allowing
anyone except Kundan near him.

1094
01:19:25,334 --> 01:19:26,974
Kundan.
- Yes grandfather.

1095
01:19:28,694 --> 01:19:29,974
I am unable to lose my soul.

1096
01:19:30,054 --> 01:19:32,054
Don't talk this way,
you shall get better.

1097
01:19:32,134 --> 01:19:35,774
I am the devotee of Goddess Bhavani.

1098
01:19:36,094 --> 01:19:37,694
Until I..

1099
01:19:38,214 --> 01:19:41,054
..don't see you in that morph..

1100
01:19:41,654 --> 01:19:43,694
..I won't be able to die.

1101
01:19:44,174 --> 01:19:45,054
Kundan.

1102
01:19:45,214 --> 01:19:46,774
Grandfather.

1103
01:19:47,094 --> 01:19:49,614
There is a bag near me..

1104
01:19:49,854 --> 01:19:51,494
..give it to me.

1105
01:19:51,894 --> 01:19:52,734
Here.

1106
01:20:13,174 --> 01:20:14,014
This.

1107
01:20:15,214 --> 01:20:16,854
is..

1108
01:20:18,214 --> 01:20:20,054
..the weapon which was offered to

1109
01:20:20,574 --> 01:20:22,574
..Goddess Bhavani.

1110
01:20:22,734 --> 01:20:23,614
Here.

1111
01:20:23,894 --> 01:20:25,814
have it, keep it with you.

1112
01:20:29,374 --> 01:20:30,614
Till date..

1113
01:20:31,174 --> 01:20:34,254
..we have given any
offerings to the Goddess.

1114
01:20:35,134 --> 01:20:36,014
Kundan.

1115
01:20:36,454 --> 01:20:39,574
Nobody can achieve anything without it.

1116
01:20:40,054 --> 01:20:41,694
Oh Goddess Bhavani.
- Grandfather.

1117
01:20:42,694 --> 01:20:44,654
What did you do?

1118
01:20:45,134 --> 01:20:48,014
Can anyone be a great
devotee by killing our people?

1119
01:20:48,094 --> 01:20:49,574
If this is the case then
I don't want such devotion.

1120
01:20:49,814 --> 01:20:53,054
This is not a murder.

1121
01:20:53,854 --> 01:20:55,214
This is an offering.

1122
01:20:55,974 --> 01:20:57,254
it is a deed in a righteous manner.

1123
01:20:58,614 --> 01:20:59,654
Kundan.

1124
01:21:00,334 --> 01:21:03,734
Kill me and offer me to the Goddess.

1125
01:21:05,014 --> 01:21:07,894
I will go straight to the heaven.

1126
01:21:07,974 --> 01:21:10,734
You think you will go to the heaven,
grandfather.

1127
01:21:11,014 --> 01:21:14,934
But will I be able to sit with peace
after killing you with my own hands?

1128
01:21:15,094 --> 01:21:17,734
My entire life shall be a hell.

1129
01:21:18,094 --> 01:21:19,734
The one whom we love..

1130
01:21:19,814 --> 01:21:23,054
..how can he be the great
devotee by killing someone he loves.

1131
01:21:23,174 --> 01:21:25,294
You are telling me,
even you are a great devotee.

1132
01:21:25,374 --> 01:21:27,254
Have you ever killed
any of your close relatives?

1133
01:21:27,334 --> 01:21:30,414
Can you ever kill anyone
close to you? Tell me.

1134
01:21:31,094 --> 01:21:31,974
Goddess.

1135
01:21:33,494 --> 01:21:34,734
Goddess.

1136
01:21:35,134 --> 01:21:36,374
Goddess, forgive me.

1137
01:21:37,974 --> 01:21:42,734
For your devotion,
I couldn't give any of my successor.

1138
01:21:42,814 --> 01:21:43,894
Grandfather.

1139
01:21:44,814 --> 01:21:45,854
Goddess.

1140
01:21:46,374 --> 01:21:49,374
I can't tolerate this anymore.

1141
01:21:49,654 --> 01:21:54,334
Goddess, you please take my life away.

1142
01:21:54,974 --> 01:21:57,054
So, you're not able to die. Right?

1143
01:21:59,574 --> 01:22:03,614
You need blood before
you take your last breath.

1144
01:22:05,294 --> 01:22:07,174
Look at this.

1145
01:22:12,334 --> 01:22:14,814
This..
- This is blood.

1146
01:22:15,934 --> 01:22:17,614
The blood stains on this sheet.

1147
01:22:18,614 --> 01:22:21,014
This blood was shed many years ago.

1148
01:22:22,654 --> 01:22:27,494
The vermilion on my forehead
was washed when the blood was shed.

1149
01:22:29,534 --> 01:22:32,894
Can you identify whose blood is this,
father-in-law?

1150
01:22:37,694 --> 01:22:41,694
Shankar!
- Grandfather..

1151
01:22:45,854 --> 01:22:49,014
What are you doing, mother?
Can't you see grandfather's condition?

1152
01:22:49,654 --> 01:22:51,654
Don't trouble him like this.

1153
01:22:52,654 --> 01:22:54,734
I've come to set him free, my son.

1154
01:22:56,334 --> 01:22:57,454
Remember that..

1155
01:22:58,574 --> 01:23:01,534
..he has already done
the greatest act of his life.

1156
01:23:03,054 --> 01:23:05,534
Yet why can't you leave our body,
father-in-law?

1157
01:23:06,894 --> 01:23:09,494
You're the one
who killed his own son.

1158
01:23:10,174 --> 01:23:12,093
Who could've done
this heinous act except you?

1159
01:23:12,173 --> 01:23:15,614
Mother, why are you acting crazy?

1160
01:23:15,974 --> 01:23:17,654
Naubatlal killed my father.

1161
01:23:17,734 --> 01:23:20,294
The person lying in
front of you killed your father.

1162
01:23:20,494 --> 01:23:23,254
Ask him who made me a widow. Ask him.

1163
01:23:23,334 --> 01:23:26,854
Ask him who made me a widow.
Who's responsible?

1164
01:23:27,494 --> 01:23:31,294
Grandpa.. grandpa..
is mother speaking the truth?

1165
01:23:32,574 --> 01:23:35,414
Grandpa, say that she's lying.
How can this be true?

1166
01:23:36,094 --> 01:23:38,734
Grandpa, why are you quiet?

1167
01:23:39,574 --> 01:23:42,414
Swear on Goddess Bhavani
and tell me who killed my father.

1168
01:23:43,014 --> 01:23:46,494
Did you kill him
or did Naubatlal kill him?

1169
01:23:47,014 --> 01:23:49,214
Grandpa, answer me.

1170
01:23:50,174 --> 01:23:54,494
Grandpa, did you become a great devotee
after shedding my father's blood?

1171
01:23:55,094 --> 01:23:56,534
Grandpa, answer me.

1172
01:23:56,894 --> 01:24:00,134
Did you become a great devotee
after shedding my father's blood?

1173
01:24:00,854 --> 01:24:03,054
Grandpa! Grandpa!

1174
01:24:05,654 --> 01:24:06,734
Answer me.

1175
01:24:07,534 --> 01:24:09,614
Answer my questions.

1176
01:24:10,294 --> 01:24:12,374
Answer my questions, grandpa.

1177
01:24:22,094 --> 01:24:25,974
Oh Goddess Bhavani.

1178
01:24:45,374 --> 01:24:47,734
Why did you share
this truth with me, mother?

1179
01:24:49,414 --> 01:24:52,494
I'll have to perform
his funeral rites.

1180
01:24:54,614 --> 01:24:56,574
Why did you tell me?

1181
01:25:21,454 --> 01:25:23,071
Kundan! Kundan!

1182
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:24,498
Take it off.

1183
01:25:25,244 --> 01:25:26,671
Why are you wearing
this blood stained blanket?

1184
01:25:27,666 --> 01:25:29,331
It's the symbol of
my father and grandfather.

1185
01:25:32,023 --> 01:25:36,454
The good deeds of one
and the sins of the other one.

1186
01:25:37,854 --> 01:25:39,192
It's stained with both.

1187
01:25:39,430 --> 01:25:41,334
My heart shudders
at the sight of this, Kundan.

1188
01:25:42,614 --> 01:25:45,014
This blanket is stained
with your father's blood.

1189
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:49,350
This is the blood that sacrificed itself..

1190
01:25:49,430 --> 01:25:52,454
..but never boiled to shed
somebody else's blood.

1191
01:25:53,214 --> 01:25:55,014
I've got this shirt
from my grandfather

1192
01:25:55,854 --> 01:25:57,894
and this blanket from my father.

1193
01:25:58,894 --> 01:26:01,382
The peace I get after draping this will
never be experienced..

1194
01:26:01,462 --> 01:26:03,294
..after wearing the shirt.

1195
01:26:04,574 --> 01:26:07,774
Grandpa, you've expired.

1196
01:26:08,534 --> 01:26:10,574
But your deeds are still alive.

1197
01:26:11,894 --> 01:26:14,814
The hatred, the conflicts
that you conceived is still alive.

1198
01:26:15,334 --> 01:26:19,454
The sins that you've left behind
in this world I'll repent for them.

1199
01:26:50,152 --> 01:26:52,379
I was supposed to play with blood.

1200
01:26:54,119 --> 01:26:58,694
But, you've already done it.
Whose blood is this?

1201
01:27:01,014 --> 01:27:07,334
This is the blood of the innocent soul who
was sacrificed before sins and tortures.

1202
01:27:09,494 --> 01:27:11,454
The enmity that has
been prevalent for generations..

1203
01:27:12,254 --> 01:27:18,134
..I want to cover it with this blanket and
drown it in the Ganges forever, Dwarka.

1204
01:27:19,374 --> 01:27:22,854
But, I need your
help to achieve this.

1205
01:27:25,494 --> 01:27:28,414
Kundan, you want to get
rid of everything very easily.

1206
01:27:30,734 --> 01:27:34,494
But what about the vow we brothers
had taken before our father's dead body?

1207
01:27:35,534 --> 01:27:39,894
I vowed to wear your or Bhawani Prasad's
blood stains on my forehead one day.

1208
01:27:48,814 --> 01:27:51,934
One should definitely
attack his enemy.

1209
01:27:53,054 --> 01:27:55,574
But, I came here to
extend my hands of friendship.

1210
01:27:55,654 --> 01:27:57,734
You've lost all courage
after your grandfather's death?

1211
01:28:00,214 --> 01:28:04,054
I've not lost courage, I detest
this life of hatred and animosity.

1212
01:28:05,014 --> 01:28:07,254
Don't you wish to end this enmity?

1213
01:28:07,654 --> 01:28:09,934
Don't you wish to get
rid of this life of hatred?

1214
01:28:10,734 --> 01:28:13,894
Don't you wish to get
rid of the fire of anger, Dwarka?

1215
01:28:13,974 --> 01:28:15,814
I'll set you free.

1216
01:28:34,374 --> 01:28:36,294
Don't worry, sir. I'm here.

1217
01:29:09,534 --> 01:29:12,509
Uncle Bhim,
call a doctor immediately.

1218
01:29:12,589 --> 01:29:17,974
Step aside, I'll kill him.
- Uncle Bhim, have you lost your mind?

1219
01:29:18,294 --> 01:29:20,734
All our differences and hatred
has ended with grandfather's death.

1220
01:29:21,214 --> 01:29:23,174
Dwarka is my brother.

1221
01:29:23,374 --> 01:29:25,654
Dwarka,
look what has happened my brother?

1222
01:29:25,925 --> 01:29:27,854
I didn't come here to fight with you.

1223
01:29:28,334 --> 01:29:31,214
I came here end the enmity
that has been going on for generations.

1224
01:29:31,503 --> 01:29:36,454
Please forgive me, my brother.
Dwarka, forgive me.

1225
01:29:45,233 --> 01:29:47,614
I won't survive, Kundan.

1226
01:29:47,694 --> 01:29:48,519
Nothing will happen to you.

1227
01:29:48,599 --> 01:29:52,854
The doctor has said you'll be fine.
Your injury will heal.

1228
01:29:52,934 --> 01:29:54,854
This injury won't heal anymore.

1229
01:29:55,795 --> 01:30:00,014
Please take me to brother
Ganeshi as soon as possible.

1230
01:30:01,854 --> 01:30:03,974
If I don't meet him before I die.

1231
01:30:04,854 --> 01:30:06,254
He will break loose.

1232
01:30:06,334 --> 01:30:07,823
Nothing will happen, Dwarka.

1233
01:30:08,310 --> 01:30:10,716
You won't die.
You'll definitely meet your brother.

1234
01:30:10,796 --> 01:30:12,814
Don't waste time, Kundan.

1235
01:30:13,894 --> 01:30:16,974
Take me to my brother by any means.

1236
01:30:18,214 --> 01:30:23,534
I want the enmity that has been going for
generations' ends right before my eyes.

1237
01:30:24,774 --> 01:30:28,374
I want Ganeshi to embrace
me right before my eyes.

1238
01:30:30,174 --> 01:30:32,974
Please take me to my brother.

1239
01:30:33,054 --> 01:30:34,814
Kundan, take me to my brother.

1240
01:30:43,174 --> 01:30:44,254
Laila..

1241
01:30:50,054 --> 01:30:51,454
..beautiful!

1242
01:30:53,734 --> 01:30:55,534
In this attire you look..

1243
01:31:02,774 --> 01:31:06,534
I look like a bride
of a reputed Hindu family. Right?

1244
01:31:07,054 --> 01:31:07,700
Do you know..

1245
01:31:09,592 --> 01:31:11,274
..I've seen you in this
attire several times.

1246
01:31:12,890 --> 01:31:15,974
I wished to bring you
home dressed as a bride.

1247
01:31:16,614 --> 01:31:20,054
Sir, come quickly.

1248
01:31:20,252 --> 01:31:22,134
Your brother is badly injured.

1249
01:31:22,214 --> 01:31:23,294
Dwarka?
- Yes, Dwarka.

1250
01:31:23,894 --> 01:31:25,094
Go and meet him immediately.

1251
01:31:26,091 --> 01:31:29,854
What has happened to you?

1252
01:31:30,199 --> 01:31:32,334
Oh god!
Look what has happened to him.

1253
01:31:33,414 --> 01:31:35,534
Oh no! I'm ruined.

1254
01:31:35,614 --> 01:31:38,614
Mother!

1255
01:31:38,694 --> 01:31:41,162
Please speak.
- Mother!

1256
01:31:41,389 --> 01:31:44,854
What happened?
What has happened to my brother?

1257
01:31:51,281 --> 01:31:52,534
Dwarka.. Dwarka, who has injured you?

1258
01:31:54,414 --> 01:31:56,574
Dwarka..

1259
01:31:57,494 --> 01:32:00,214
Dwarka who is he?

1260
01:32:01,414 --> 01:32:03,174
Who has injured you?

1261
01:32:04,178 --> 01:32:07,334
Dwarka,
tell me his name and I'll kill him.

1262
01:32:10,814 --> 01:32:11,694
Yes, Dwarka.

1263
01:32:11,774 --> 01:32:14,654
I'll stain my hands with his blood.

1264
01:32:15,774 --> 01:32:17,094
Dwarka, tell me. Who is he?

1265
01:32:22,494 --> 01:32:23,414
Who is he?

1266
01:32:31,654 --> 01:32:34,054
Yes, Dwarka..

1267
01:32:34,894 --> 01:32:36,614
Dwarka.. Dwarka..

1268
01:32:37,774 --> 01:32:40,054
Dwarka!

1269
01:32:59,454 --> 01:33:00,734
Who are you?

1270
01:33:01,854 --> 01:33:03,334
Who killed my brother?

1271
01:33:05,014 --> 01:33:07,654
Why was he looking at
you continuously before he died?

1272
01:33:07,734 --> 01:33:09,854
What did he want to say?

1273
01:33:09,934 --> 01:33:12,414
I'm unfortunate that
he couldn't say anything to you.

1274
01:33:12,494 --> 01:33:13,985
I had sent some men with him.

1275
01:33:14,065 --> 01:33:14,817
Where are they?

1276
01:33:15,650 --> 01:33:17,055
The men left him alone and ran away.

1277
01:33:17,135 --> 01:33:18,953
Why did they leave him alone?
Where did they run away?

1278
01:33:19,033 --> 01:33:21,894
Brother, have you succeeded
in taking revenge?

1279
01:33:22,534 --> 01:33:25,854
Have you got peace
after making me a widow?

1280
01:33:26,254 --> 01:33:29,454
Wipe off the vermilion
on my forehead with your hands.

1281
01:33:29,694 --> 01:33:34,294
Break my bangles. Break them.

1282
01:33:37,186 --> 01:33:41,315
Madam, what was his name?
- Whose?

1283
01:33:41,790 --> 01:33:42,654
His.

1284
01:33:43,315 --> 01:33:44,534
Whose?

1285
01:33:44,734 --> 01:33:46,734
The person you fell
in love with in Banaras.

1286
01:33:47,174 --> 01:33:50,094
Who told you about it?

1287
01:33:50,363 --> 01:33:51,534
It's clear from your plight.

1288
01:33:52,094 --> 01:33:55,174
I can clearly see that
after you came back from Banaras..

1289
01:33:55,494 --> 01:33:57,374
..you always stay lost.

1290
01:33:57,790 --> 01:33:59,854
You neither dress up like
you used to nor do you sing or dance.

1291
01:34:00,294 --> 01:34:04,454
You don't even stay
in the dance room now.

1292
01:34:05,681 --> 01:34:07,216
Greetings, madam.

1293
01:34:07,951 --> 01:34:09,536
What brings you early
in the morning today?

1294
01:34:09,616 --> 01:34:11,194
I went to Ganeshi sir's
mansion this morning.

1295
01:34:11,627 --> 01:34:13,428
Accept greetings from him.

1296
01:34:13,508 --> 01:34:16,494
Nisar, tell me something.
What happened to Dwarka?

1297
01:34:16,574 --> 01:34:19,054
He was beaten. He thrashed him badly.

1298
01:34:19,334 --> 01:34:20,894
What's his name? Kundan.

1299
01:34:21,226 --> 01:34:24,134
I've heard that he's
revered a lot in Banaras.

1300
01:34:24,494 --> 01:34:28,054
A kind man brought Dwarka here.

1301
01:34:28,414 --> 01:34:31,814
Or Ganeshi Prasad wouldn't
have got to see his brother's dead body.

1302
01:34:32,070 --> 01:34:34,534
Didn't Ganeshi's
men bring Dwarka here?

1303
01:34:34,614 --> 01:34:36,934
No. All of them ran away.

1304
01:34:37,014 --> 01:34:38,534
None of them came back.

1305
01:34:38,894 --> 01:34:41,494
Kundan's life is in danger now.

1306
01:34:41,574 --> 01:34:44,934
Mr. Ganeshi is going to
Banaras to avenge his brother's death.

1307
01:34:45,134 --> 01:34:46,094
No..

1308
01:34:47,334 --> 01:34:50,014
No, he won't go. I won't let him go.

1309
01:35:04,454 --> 01:35:05,254
Kundan..

1310
01:35:15,174 --> 01:35:16,654
I know you're Kundan.

1311
01:35:17,094 --> 01:35:19,854
Once I saw you with your
grandfather on the banks of Kashi.

1312
01:35:21,454 --> 01:35:24,454
Your mother and grandmother
helped my maiden family a lot.

1313
01:35:25,454 --> 01:35:28,094
So, I was startled
to see you here, brother.

1314
01:35:28,774 --> 01:35:31,294
How did you come here?
What do you want?

1315
01:35:34,574 --> 01:35:37,374
The fire of hatred that's
burning between the families..

1316
01:35:38,174 --> 01:35:40,014
..I came to extinguish it, sister.

1317
01:35:40,894 --> 01:35:44,254
But, what shall I do now?
Who shall I talk to?

1318
01:35:45,334 --> 01:35:47,214
Dwarka has made me helpless.

1319
01:35:50,014 --> 01:35:52,134
I haven't slept
in the past 8-10 days.

1320
01:35:54,134 --> 01:35:56,254
So, I'm staying here
so I beg before all of you..

1321
01:35:56,494 --> 01:36:00,294
..to forgive me for
the mistakes of my forefathers.

1322
01:36:02,534 --> 01:36:06,289
So, I came along with
Dwarka so that the enmity ends.

1323
01:36:06,689 --> 01:36:08,214
But, he left us.

1324
01:36:09,012 --> 01:36:12,614
He left my hands.
- This enmity will never end.

1325
01:36:13,934 --> 01:36:17,134
The family in which fires
of anger and pride burn all the time..

1326
01:36:17,758 --> 01:36:20,374
..won't show mercy
and compassion to you.

1327
01:36:21,334 --> 01:36:26,614
Therefore forget what you wish to do.

1328
01:36:27,855 --> 01:36:29,054
Go away from here.

1329
01:36:42,622 --> 01:36:44,558
Tell Ganeshi that
Laila has come to meet him.

1330
01:36:44,638 --> 01:36:45,402
Okay.

1331
01:36:46,483 --> 01:36:47,734
Wait.

1332
01:36:55,014 --> 01:36:57,534
Shall we go, madam?
- No.

1333
01:37:48,014 --> 01:37:52,654
"Come to me, look at me".

1334
01:37:52,934 --> 01:37:57,614
"Come to me, look at me".

1335
01:37:57,694 --> 01:38:02,734
"You will find youth in these eyes."

1336
01:38:02,814 --> 01:38:07,294
"Come to me, look at me"

1337
01:38:07,494 --> 01:38:12,214
"Listen to my heart beats".

1338
01:38:12,294 --> 01:38:17,174
"You will get your story in them".

1339
01:38:17,254 --> 01:38:21,654
"Come to me, look at me".

1340
01:38:29,654 --> 01:38:34,454
"On my lips that are shivering".

1341
01:38:34,534 --> 01:38:38,974
"You will find one of your songs".

1342
01:38:39,054 --> 01:38:45,814
"In my eyes having tears,
you will find".

1343
01:38:46,174 --> 01:38:50,814
"few lost things belonging to you".

1344
01:38:51,134 --> 01:38:55,174
"Come to me, look at me".

1345
01:38:55,694 --> 01:39:00,774
"Listen to my heart beats".

1346
01:39:00,854 --> 01:39:05,534
"You will get your story in them".

1347
01:39:05,654 --> 01:39:09,974
"Come to me, look at me".

1348
01:39:27,574 --> 01:39:32,174
"Come today".

1349
01:39:32,414 --> 01:39:37,014
"Come today I want to hug you".

1350
01:39:37,214 --> 01:39:41,494
"For you, I will break
every promise that I have made".

1351
01:39:41,734 --> 01:39:46,334
"The one who exploits".

1352
01:39:46,414 --> 01:39:48,414
"Are somebody else".

1353
01:39:48,774 --> 01:39:53,534
"Here you will get me".

1354
01:39:53,614 --> 01:39:57,934
"Come to me, look at me".

1355
01:40:12,534 --> 01:40:17,494
"Come in the arms of love".

1356
01:40:17,574 --> 01:40:22,014
"Hug me tight".

1357
01:40:22,094 --> 01:40:28,934
"You will find a restless
and a scared heart".

1358
01:40:29,174 --> 01:40:33,974
"You will find a restless life".

1359
01:40:34,054 --> 01:40:38,294
"Come to me, look at me".

1360
01:40:38,454 --> 01:40:43,254
"Listen to my heart beats".

1361
01:40:43,334 --> 01:40:47,934
"You will get you story here".

1362
01:40:48,014 --> 01:40:52,934
"Come to me, look at me".

1363
01:40:58,174 --> 01:40:59,054
What is this?

1364
01:41:00,214 --> 01:41:02,414
Why are you chasing me?
What do you want?

1365
01:41:02,814 --> 01:41:04,094
And what if I say..

1366
01:41:04,254 --> 01:41:05,534
..I want you, then?

1367
01:41:09,134 --> 01:41:10,654
Please leave me alone.

1368
01:41:11,374 --> 01:41:13,054
And I request you.

1369
01:41:13,134 --> 01:41:14,774
Don't leave me alone.

1370
01:41:15,694 --> 01:41:17,776
That was enough the
way you humiliated me..

1371
01:41:17,856 --> 01:41:20,214
..in front of my mother,
and grandmother and others.

1372
01:41:21,614 --> 01:41:22,934
Go away from here.

1373
01:41:23,774 --> 01:41:24,774
Okay I will leave.

1374
01:41:25,094 --> 01:41:26,054
Return me my bangle.

1375
01:41:26,134 --> 01:41:27,054
Which bangle?

1376
01:41:27,294 --> 01:41:29,414
The one matching with this.

1377
01:41:30,174 --> 01:41:32,214
Why don't you remember this bangle?

1378
01:41:33,294 --> 01:41:34,454
I don't remember.

1379
01:41:36,014 --> 01:41:38,254
Do you know what are people
who keep forgetting like you called as?

1380
01:41:39,174 --> 01:41:40,014
Unloyal.

1381
01:41:40,494 --> 01:41:41,694
And what about people like you?

1382
01:41:42,414 --> 01:41:43,974
What are people like you called, Munni?

1383
01:41:44,654 --> 01:41:47,174
You had come along
with enemies to kill me.

1384
01:41:47,814 --> 01:41:49,814
What do you think,
I have forgotten everything?

1385
01:41:49,894 --> 01:41:51,854
No, how will you forget?

1386
01:41:52,054 --> 01:41:54,214
When the killer was on your head.

1387
01:41:54,414 --> 01:41:56,974
Then I had thrown my
bangle and had woken you up.

1388
01:41:57,054 --> 01:41:59,734
Isn't it true,
that you had come along with Dwarka?

1389
01:42:00,494 --> 01:42:02,134
If you would have got hurt,
you would have realised.

1390
01:42:02,494 --> 01:42:04,734
If instead of Dwarka I
would have tied you upside down.

1391
01:42:05,414 --> 01:42:07,294
With the help of a rope.

1392
01:42:07,374 --> 01:42:08,254
Then you would understand.

1393
01:42:09,894 --> 01:42:11,334
Was that you Munni?

1394
01:42:12,934 --> 01:42:17,534
You tried to kill him Munni?

1395
01:42:17,614 --> 01:42:18,454
Oh no.

1396
01:42:18,694 --> 01:42:21,134
Kandi had changed
the glasses of alcohol.

1397
01:42:21,414 --> 01:42:24,014
And the one which
you were going to drink..

1398
01:42:24,094 --> 01:42:25,294
..Dwarka had it.

1399
01:42:25,534 --> 01:42:27,734
Did you see how he was swinging?

1400
01:42:28,134 --> 01:42:29,774
Drink it Dwarka.

1401
01:42:30,294 --> 01:42:32,654
What thing did you give me to drink.

1402
01:42:34,934 --> 01:42:36,974
Munni.
- Kundan.

1403
01:42:37,574 --> 01:42:38,614
Munni.

1404
01:42:41,139 --> 01:42:42,620
When we met in Kashi the first time..

1405
01:42:43,517 --> 01:42:47,494
..What were your intentions?
- To seek blessings of the Ganges.

1406
01:42:48,054 --> 01:42:51,054
That lady Champa when she got
me here from Kashi as her daughter.

1407
01:42:51,694 --> 01:42:53,094
She died.

1408
01:42:53,974 --> 01:42:55,614
I had gone there carrying flowers.

1409
01:42:56,454 --> 01:42:57,894
I had this hope in mind..

1410
01:42:58,774 --> 01:43:02,174
..that will meet my
childhood friend Kundan.

1411
01:43:04,094 --> 01:43:07,734
Then why did you go away from there.

1412
01:43:08,254 --> 01:43:09,654
I was scared Kundan.

1413
01:43:09,894 --> 01:43:11,334
I was scared of your love.

1414
01:43:12,134 --> 01:43:13,254
The way you met me.

1415
01:43:13,574 --> 01:43:15,934
I thought if I face you once more..

1416
01:43:16,174 --> 01:43:18,094
..then won't be able
to hide anything from you.

1417
01:43:18,574 --> 01:43:20,014
My secrets will be revealed.

1418
01:43:20,094 --> 01:43:21,614
And you will start hating me.

1419
01:43:24,094 --> 01:43:26,374
If my Munni would show me her sorrows.

1420
01:43:26,654 --> 01:43:28,414
Then you think I would have hated you?

1421
01:43:28,854 --> 01:43:30,294
You wouldn't?
- No.

1422
01:43:30,854 --> 01:43:32,374
I would have hugged her.

1423
01:43:33,374 --> 01:43:34,454
And would say, Munni.

1424
01:43:35,134 --> 01:43:38,014
Both God and Humans
have been unfair to you.

1425
01:43:38,814 --> 01:43:40,254
Forgive all of them.

1426
01:43:40,894 --> 01:43:45,894
No, Kundan. God has been
kind to me and has given you.

1427
01:43:46,534 --> 01:43:49,014
This moment, this time is mine.
Everything is mine.

1428
01:43:49,374 --> 01:43:51,934
I won't let you go
away from me for a moment.

1429
01:43:53,294 --> 01:43:54,974
My Munni has gone mad.

1430
01:43:55,134 --> 01:43:58,054
Yes, I have gone crazy meeting you.

1431
01:43:58,894 --> 01:44:00,734
When Keeping your image in my eyes..

1432
01:44:00,974 --> 01:44:02,414
..when I close my eyes.

1433
01:44:03,134 --> 01:44:05,134
Then I get scared to open my eyes.

1434
01:44:05,614 --> 01:44:07,294
Scared that you might get vanished.

1435
01:44:07,494 --> 01:44:08,214
Laila.

1436
01:44:09,054 --> 01:44:09,894
Laila?

1437
01:44:10,494 --> 01:44:11,134
No.

1438
01:44:11,694 --> 01:44:13,254
I am your Munni, Kundan.

1439
01:44:13,854 --> 01:44:15,694
Laila was the dancer.

1440
01:44:16,014 --> 01:44:17,934
And I want to forget her right now.

1441
01:44:18,814 --> 01:44:21,734
Kundan, please don't
call me by that name again.

1442
01:44:21,934 --> 01:44:22,774
Madam.

1443
01:44:23,334 --> 01:44:24,694
Mr. Rajasaheb is here.

1444
01:44:25,054 --> 01:44:27,094
I told him a lot,
but he is not ready to leave.

1445
01:44:27,294 --> 01:44:29,694
He says,
won't leave without meeting you.

1446
01:44:42,214 --> 01:44:43,254
Yes darling.

1447
01:44:43,614 --> 01:44:44,374
How are you?

1448
01:44:45,414 --> 01:44:46,734
I was fine till now.

1449
01:44:47,334 --> 01:44:48,574
What got you here?

1450
01:44:48,774 --> 01:44:51,934
Just to listen to you, to talk to you.

1451
01:44:52,734 --> 01:44:54,574
This place has become very silent.

1452
01:44:55,214 --> 01:44:55,894
Laila.

1453
01:44:56,574 --> 01:45:00,174
It is been long since there
has been any dance show here.

1454
01:45:01,214 --> 01:45:02,854
I have stopped it now.

1455
01:45:04,174 --> 01:45:06,854
I know that,
but why has Ganeshi stopped coming here?

1456
01:45:07,574 --> 01:45:10,134
I thought he is upset about his brother.

1457
01:45:10,574 --> 01:45:13,054
So I thought I should
come over for some fun.

1458
01:45:13,134 --> 01:45:14,654
You better leave Mr. Rajasaheb.

1459
01:45:15,214 --> 01:45:17,134
I have stopped dancing and singing.

1460
01:45:17,654 --> 01:45:19,694
You better don't
take pains to come here.

1461
01:45:19,774 --> 01:45:22,894
Laila, don't be so rude to your lovers.

1462
01:45:23,135 --> 01:45:24,125
Take this..

1463
01:45:24,205 --> 01:45:26,734
..it is a necklace of real diamonds,
which you returned back that day.

1464
01:45:27,254 --> 01:45:28,494
I got it back for you.

1465
01:45:28,574 --> 01:45:30,214
Nobody else can.

1466
01:45:34,774 --> 01:45:35,894
Rajasaheb.

1467
01:45:36,774 --> 01:45:39,054
This is not a court.

1468
01:45:40,174 --> 01:45:41,774
This place belongs
to 'Laila of the sky'.

1469
01:45:43,534 --> 01:45:45,414
Think well before you come here.

1470
01:45:52,494 --> 01:45:54,094
I am leaving you this time.

1471
01:45:54,574 --> 01:45:58,974
But if you come here again
then I will throw your dead body out.

1472
01:45:59,134 --> 01:46:00,054
Okay.

1473
01:46:00,454 --> 01:46:03,094
Now we will decide upon
this once we have the dead body.

1474
01:46:03,174 --> 01:46:05,374
Remember Ganeshiprasad.

1475
01:46:07,454 --> 01:46:09,614
Dogs don't leave chasing so easily.

1476
01:46:16,974 --> 01:46:17,894
I am tired Laila.

1477
01:46:19,774 --> 01:46:22,534
I am tired of keeping
this weapon with me.

1478
01:46:24,614 --> 01:46:26,294
I missed you a lot last few days.

1479
01:46:27,494 --> 01:46:28,774
I really missed you.

1480
01:46:29,814 --> 01:46:31,934
But the situation was
such that I couldn't come.

1481
01:46:32,974 --> 01:46:34,174
I was scared.

1482
01:46:34,574 --> 01:46:35,694
That you might get angry.

1483
01:46:37,174 --> 01:46:38,774
Why will I be angry at you?

1484
01:46:39,163 --> 01:46:41,563
Laila has got that thing from you..

1485
01:46:42,083 --> 01:46:44,203
..which I had not thought
of even in my dreams.

1486
01:46:44,563 --> 01:46:49,043
If Ganeshiprasad too gets that thing from
Laila, then his dreams will come true.

1487
01:46:50,243 --> 01:46:51,563
Come with me Laila.

1488
01:46:52,003 --> 01:46:55,123
Leave this notorious place,
people keep coming here for you.

1489
01:46:55,523 --> 01:46:57,363
I keep thinking about you the whole dy.

1490
01:46:57,883 --> 01:47:00,363
If anyone else look at you,
I am just not able to tolerate it.

1491
01:47:01,243 --> 01:47:04,123
I want to keep you in
front of my eyes throughout.

1492
01:47:05,003 --> 01:47:06,843
With your eyes shut?

1493
01:47:07,243 --> 01:47:08,283
Shut inside my eyes.

1494
01:47:08,363 --> 01:47:09,613
Ganeshiprasad.

1495
01:47:10,240 --> 01:47:12,110
Hey Ganeshiprasad! You rascal.

1496
01:47:12,190 --> 01:47:15,243
Who is this scoundrel?
- If you're brave enough then come out.

1497
01:47:15,723 --> 01:47:18,243
Listen.. please don't go,
it must be Rajasaheb's men.

1498
01:47:26,043 --> 01:47:27,643
What would you do if you had the weapon?

1499
01:47:27,723 --> 01:47:29,163
Wait!

1500
01:48:00,483 --> 01:48:01,723
Go away.

1501
01:48:16,763 --> 01:48:18,483
Where did you
go away all of a sudden?

1502
01:48:19,883 --> 01:48:22,283
The doctor advised
you not to talk, sir.

1503
01:48:25,483 --> 01:48:28,083
Laila..
- Yes.

1504
01:48:31,083 --> 01:48:34,523
Rajasaheb did a big
favour for me while leaving.

1505
01:48:35,563 --> 01:48:36,603
Good.

1506
01:48:37,803 --> 01:48:40,163
At least I can be
with you for some days.

1507
01:48:43,803 --> 01:48:47,283
I've heard people give space in their heart
too while giving space in their house.

1508
01:48:54,403 --> 01:48:55,803
He is our guest.

1509
01:48:56,243 --> 01:48:58,083
Till I am here, even he will stay here.

1510
01:48:59,083 --> 01:49:00,723
I will make arrangements for his stay.

1511
01:49:03,883 --> 01:49:05,363
Did you see my Laila?

1512
01:49:05,843 --> 01:49:08,203
Yes, I saw her.

1513
01:49:08,403 --> 01:49:10,083
She is so beautiful.

1514
01:49:11,963 --> 01:49:13,923
I love her a lot.

1515
01:49:15,003 --> 01:49:17,643
I can sacrifice everything for her.

1516
01:49:19,243 --> 01:49:22,523
But I couldn't understand till date
the amount of love she feels for me.

1517
01:49:22,963 --> 01:49:25,723
If she loves me or not.

1518
01:49:25,963 --> 01:49:27,443
You take rest.

1519
01:49:28,523 --> 01:49:29,843
Listen.
- Yes.

1520
01:49:30,603 --> 01:49:32,403
You don't have relative
here in this city?

1521
01:49:33,763 --> 01:49:35,523
No one apart from you.

1522
01:49:36,963 --> 01:49:38,923
Tell me if you have any problems.

1523
01:49:39,723 --> 01:49:41,083
Don't worry about me.

1524
01:50:03,243 --> 01:50:04,403
Kundan.

1525
01:50:05,643 --> 01:50:08,243
Please take your Munni
away from this place.

1526
01:50:08,643 --> 01:50:11,003
Laila's lovers will not let her survive.

1527
01:50:11,483 --> 01:50:14,163
Send my Munni back to that Laila.

1528
01:50:15,363 --> 01:50:18,603
Whom Ganeshji loves so much.

1529
01:50:18,883 --> 01:50:20,563
Don't you love Munni?

1530
01:50:21,483 --> 01:50:23,003
Don't you want me?

1531
01:50:23,643 --> 01:50:24,883
I love you a lot Munni.

1532
01:50:26,203 --> 01:50:28,123
I love you a lot.

1533
01:50:29,363 --> 01:50:32,043
But I can't take away Ganeshi's
happiness for my selfishness.

1534
01:50:33,203 --> 01:50:34,923
I can't make him sad.

1535
01:50:37,843 --> 01:50:39,203
He doesn't know me.

1536
01:50:39,403 --> 01:50:41,843
But I know who I am.

1537
01:50:42,683 --> 01:50:45,123
I will sacrifice my love.

1538
01:50:45,723 --> 01:50:48,563
But I will never hurt him.

1539
01:50:48,643 --> 01:50:50,483
You will sacrifice me for him?

1540
01:50:51,203 --> 01:50:53,843
Who rates your Munni with their money.

1541
01:50:54,363 --> 01:50:57,883
They want to give and take
hearts being high on alcohol.

1542
01:50:57,963 --> 01:50:59,403
I hate these people.

1543
01:51:02,363 --> 01:51:03,203
Kundan.

1544
01:51:03,843 --> 01:51:05,123
I am yours.

1545
01:51:05,483 --> 01:51:07,083
I love you.

1546
01:51:07,803 --> 01:51:09,443
Please don't separate me from yourself.

1547
01:51:09,723 --> 01:51:12,363
I will be disgraced.
- Munni..

1548
01:51:13,603 --> 01:51:16,323
Kundan's conscience is guilty,
you've to help him.

1549
01:51:17,883 --> 01:51:22,003
You don't know how much we
have been rude to Ganeshi's family.

1550
01:51:23,123 --> 01:51:25,083
We have killed his father.

1551
01:51:25,923 --> 01:51:27,643
Made his mother a widow.

1552
01:51:29,003 --> 01:51:31,203
She died due to the sorrows.

1553
01:51:35,403 --> 01:51:38,043
My grandfather has killed
many innocent people.

1554
01:51:39,683 --> 01:51:43,523
He is no more now, but he indirectly
has put all the blames upon me.

1555
01:51:45,483 --> 01:51:47,163
I'm entangled in his sins.

1556
01:51:48,363 --> 01:51:50,883
I have killed Dwarka with these hands.

1557
01:51:53,643 --> 01:51:56,323
I have to make up for this mistake.

1558
01:51:57,323 --> 01:52:02,203
I have to give up on my dreams and
wishes and help Ganeshi and his family.

1559
01:52:03,283 --> 01:52:04,603
This is my duty.

1560
01:52:06,923 --> 01:52:08,963
Then listen to me Kundan.

1561
01:52:09,683 --> 01:52:12,123
I can't gift my love to someone for you.

1562
01:52:12,843 --> 01:52:14,203
You fulfill your duties..

1563
01:52:14,803 --> 01:52:16,403
..and I will fulfill my love.

1564
01:52:33,003 --> 01:52:34,363
From where did you get these flowers?

1565
01:52:34,843 --> 01:52:37,483
I had gone to the temple.

1566
01:52:37,843 --> 01:52:39,963
Have got these from there.

1567
01:52:41,283 --> 01:52:43,843
Whenever I see you,
I remember my brother.

1568
01:52:45,643 --> 01:52:47,483
You've helped us many times.

1569
01:52:49,563 --> 01:52:51,003
I'm your servant, sir.

1570
01:52:52,323 --> 01:52:54,203
If I will be of any help to you..

1571
01:52:54,763 --> 01:52:56,643
..then I will feel blessed.

1572
01:52:56,723 --> 01:53:01,443
Without any reason of any expectation
how can you have so much of belief?

1573
01:53:02,203 --> 01:53:03,483
This is not belief.

1574
01:53:04,123 --> 01:53:05,083
This is selfishness.

1575
01:53:06,483 --> 01:53:08,883
I had thought I will make
Dwarka reach to you alive..

1576
01:53:09,923 --> 01:53:12,443
..it'll be a good deed that'll help
to erase my sinful acts of the past.

1577
01:53:13,643 --> 01:53:15,803
But, I wasn't
destined to be so lucky.

1578
01:53:17,363 --> 01:53:19,283
Dwarka had come to Calcutta.

1579
01:53:19,883 --> 01:53:21,203
But it was of no use.

1580
01:53:22,043 --> 01:53:23,963
Yes, will always be sad about it.

1581
01:53:24,243 --> 01:53:26,003
Till the end of my life.

1582
01:53:27,443 --> 01:53:30,283
He was such a brave and a fearless boy.

1583
01:53:32,443 --> 01:53:34,523
Have you heard of Kashi's Bhavaniprasad?

1584
01:53:34,603 --> 01:53:35,883
Yes.

1585
01:53:36,363 --> 01:53:38,403
But he is no more now, he is dead.

1586
01:53:38,683 --> 01:53:41,003
But his grandson, Kundan is alive.

1587
01:53:42,243 --> 01:53:44,203
He is still alive.

1588
01:53:46,323 --> 01:53:47,563
Do you know him?

1589
01:53:50,643 --> 01:53:52,283
Yes, I know him very well.

1590
01:53:52,443 --> 01:53:55,563
If I won't take the
revenge of my brother..

1591
01:53:56,403 --> 01:53:59,723
..his widower wife,
his orphan children..

1592
01:53:59,803 --> 01:54:03,563
..then think that Ganeshi
is not Naubatlal's son.

1593
01:54:05,683 --> 01:54:06,883
Will you come with me to Kashi?

1594
01:54:07,243 --> 01:54:08,923
Even I will come to Kashi.

1595
01:54:09,283 --> 01:54:11,163
Are you going to bathe in the Ganga?

1596
01:54:12,043 --> 01:54:13,843
I have committed many sins.

1597
01:54:13,923 --> 01:54:15,563
Even I will get chance to lessen them.

1598
01:54:16,683 --> 01:54:19,163
Such beautiful flowers.

1599
01:54:20,203 --> 01:54:21,883
Have you got them? -Yes.

1600
01:54:22,323 --> 01:54:24,723
Laila, did you love the flowers?

1601
01:54:26,723 --> 01:54:29,163
I love them since childhood.

1602
01:54:29,963 --> 01:54:32,443
Get flowers for Laila every morning.
- As you order, sir.

1603
01:54:32,523 --> 01:54:36,923
Give us alms. God will bless you.

1604
01:54:37,003 --> 01:54:39,483
Listen.. here are some..

1605
01:54:40,803 --> 01:54:42,603
What did you say your name was?

1606
01:54:43,203 --> 01:54:46,363
Well.. - Bajrangi. Don't you remember?
- Oh!

1607
01:54:46,843 --> 01:54:49,323
Bajrangi.

1608
01:54:49,963 --> 01:54:54,523
Give some donation
to the ages on my behalf.

1609
01:54:54,883 --> 01:54:56,563
You give them money,
I'll give them grains.

1610
01:54:57,083 --> 01:54:58,763
I also want to earn some good deeds.

1611
01:55:01,803 --> 01:55:04,003
Give alms, god will bless you.

1612
01:55:04,083 --> 01:55:07,163
You all wait here, I will ask madam.
- Okay.

1613
01:55:07,243 --> 01:55:08,283
Madam.

1614
01:55:08,363 --> 01:55:10,603
These people are entering inside.

1615
01:55:10,803 --> 01:55:11,723
Give them grains.

1616
01:55:11,923 --> 01:55:12,803
Wait.

1617
01:55:14,683 --> 01:55:17,363
Listen, tell him..

1618
01:55:17,683 --> 01:55:21,163
..pray in such a way that
Munni must get her love back.

1619
01:55:21,563 --> 01:55:23,603
He will not listen to such prayers.

1620
01:55:23,883 --> 01:55:25,163
Why not?

1621
01:55:25,243 --> 01:55:28,323
You are giving him grains.

1622
01:55:28,963 --> 01:55:30,923
You are getting your love.

1623
01:55:31,323 --> 01:55:33,123
Then why not he get his love.

1624
01:55:37,283 --> 01:55:39,123
Take, madam has given this.

1625
01:55:39,243 --> 01:55:40,523
God bless you.

1626
01:55:40,603 --> 01:55:42,523
God bless your madam too.

1627
01:55:42,803 --> 01:55:45,763
Hail Lord Shiva.

1628
01:55:49,203 --> 01:55:50,843
Nothing happens by t heir saying.

1629
01:55:51,283 --> 01:55:53,843
God knows I am not your madam.

1630
01:55:54,243 --> 01:55:55,483
You are my sir.

1631
01:56:15,283 --> 01:56:16,483
Why have you come here?

1632
01:56:18,203 --> 01:56:20,283
You had left the door open for me.

1633
01:56:20,763 --> 01:56:21,963
So I entered in.

1634
01:56:22,163 --> 01:56:24,163
What do you want?

1635
01:56:24,603 --> 01:56:26,563
Why have you come here?

1636
01:56:26,923 --> 01:56:29,003
I have come to say something.

1637
01:56:30,963 --> 01:56:31,803
Kundan.

1638
01:56:32,323 --> 01:56:35,043
Your rudeness has irritated me.

1639
01:56:35,123 --> 01:56:38,723
Have I irritated you
or are you irritating me?

1640
01:56:39,843 --> 01:56:42,843
What if Ganeshi comes to know about it?

1641
01:56:43,003 --> 01:56:44,003
Whatever.

1642
01:56:44,883 --> 01:56:46,963
Am I his wife to get scared?

1643
01:56:48,843 --> 01:56:53,003
Do you why have I come here?

1644
01:56:54,163 --> 01:56:56,283
So that I can take you away from here.

1645
01:56:57,843 --> 01:56:58,723
Yes, it's a fact.

1646
01:57:03,083 --> 01:57:04,163
You are surprised?

1647
01:57:04,523 --> 01:57:06,003
Please go and sleep.

1648
01:57:06,283 --> 01:57:07,523
If master is upset..

1649
01:57:07,723 --> 01:57:09,483
How can the slave sleep?

1650
01:57:10,603 --> 01:57:12,163
There is no use of such talks.

1651
01:57:13,443 --> 01:57:15,123
Nothing makes difference to you.

1652
01:57:16,483 --> 01:57:20,683
You can't see anything apart
from restlessness and stubbornness.

1653
01:57:21,963 --> 01:57:24,083
I don't understand..

1654
01:57:24,363 --> 01:57:25,403
..how you became this way.

1655
01:57:27,163 --> 01:57:28,443
I have become shameless.

1656
01:57:29,123 --> 01:57:30,803
But it is for you.

1657
01:57:30,883 --> 01:57:32,243
Not for anyone else.

1658
01:57:34,843 --> 01:57:38,043
Your selfishness is not
going to let me achieve anything.

1659
01:57:38,523 --> 01:57:41,683
If love is selfish
then yes I am selfish.

1660
01:57:42,683 --> 01:57:44,083
I cannot remove you form my heart.

1661
01:57:44,683 --> 01:57:47,009
I cannot live without you,
not even for a while.

1662
01:57:47,089 --> 01:57:48,523
Why don't you understand?

1663
01:57:49,323 --> 01:57:52,083
Time has changed our paths.

1664
01:57:52,843 --> 01:57:54,563
It didn't let me be your Kundan.

1665
01:57:55,163 --> 01:57:57,163
It didn't let you be mine.

1666
01:57:57,843 --> 01:58:00,283
It changed our appearances too.

1667
01:58:00,363 --> 01:58:01,883
But it changed our hearts.

1668
01:58:02,443 --> 01:58:04,843
I am only yours.
- No.

1669
01:58:05,563 --> 01:58:07,323
I will sink in your arms.

1670
01:58:07,403 --> 01:58:09,723
Please accept me.

1671
01:58:09,803 --> 01:58:10,923
No, Munni, no.

1672
01:58:11,003 --> 01:58:14,163
Kundan, this is a fire
which can't be extinguished.

1673
01:58:14,723 --> 01:58:16,003
Please accept me, Kundan.

1674
01:58:16,083 --> 01:58:18,483
Hug me tight.

1675
01:58:18,963 --> 01:58:21,003
Munni, get back in your senses.

1676
01:58:21,243 --> 01:58:22,403
Munni.

1677
01:58:34,203 --> 01:58:35,003
Munni.

1678
01:58:35,803 --> 01:58:36,763
Shut up!

1679
01:58:37,363 --> 01:58:38,963
I am not Munni.

1680
01:58:39,403 --> 01:58:40,683
I am the owner of this house.

1681
01:58:40,923 --> 01:58:42,923
You will call me madam.

1682
01:58:43,203 --> 01:58:44,723
Got it? Madam.

1683
01:59:03,883 --> 01:59:05,403
Bajrangi.

1684
01:59:05,923 --> 01:59:07,843
Sir wants Kundan. Right?

1685
01:59:08,243 --> 01:59:12,963
I will kill all people
named Kundan in Kashi..

1686
01:59:13,243 --> 01:59:15,403
See the preparation of my boys.

1687
01:59:18,403 --> 01:59:20,403
Hit the target.

1688
01:59:28,123 --> 01:59:31,323
Wonderful! What great skills!

1689
01:59:32,563 --> 01:59:33,843
Did you see that?

1690
01:59:34,123 --> 01:59:35,243
I said.

1691
01:59:35,363 --> 01:59:40,123
All these knives will
be put into Kundan's chest.

1692
01:59:40,203 --> 01:59:43,723
Our Sir must be somewhere else now.

1693
01:59:43,923 --> 01:59:46,403
If he leaves that woman.

1694
01:59:46,563 --> 01:59:48,083
Isn't it?

1695
01:59:48,443 --> 01:59:49,643
Ill-mannered fellow.

1696
01:59:51,203 --> 01:59:53,963
Wait.

1697
02:00:05,363 --> 02:00:08,523
Dare you talk anything
nonsense about boss.

1698
02:00:11,043 --> 02:00:12,567
I've thrown the dice.

1699
02:00:12,751 --> 02:00:17,603
My prediction won't go wrong.
I can see everything.

1700
02:00:17,883 --> 02:00:19,443
What is the future of my family?

1701
02:00:19,963 --> 02:00:24,043
Your family, great confusion in mind,
there's problem..

1702
02:00:24,363 --> 02:00:26,523
Which language is this saint?

1703
02:00:26,603 --> 02:00:28,163
This is the language of the future.

1704
02:00:28,243 --> 02:00:30,883
This will be the language
of the country in future.

1705
02:00:31,083 --> 02:00:32,603
Listen.

1706
02:00:32,683 --> 02:00:35,043
We didn't ask about the language,
we asked about our future.

1707
02:00:35,123 --> 02:00:37,003
What is he saying?

1708
02:00:37,243 --> 02:00:38,083
Tell us about our future.

1709
02:00:38,163 --> 02:00:39,763
Your future is in danger.

1710
02:00:40,003 --> 02:00:41,563
Big danger.

1711
02:00:41,963 --> 02:00:43,163
Shall I reveal what it is?

1712
02:00:43,443 --> 02:00:46,883
Tell us fast.
Help us get rid of the problem.

1713
02:00:46,963 --> 02:00:50,323
Shut up you naughty boy. If you
talk too much I'll slap you hard.

1714
02:00:50,403 --> 02:00:51,763
Don't listen to him.

1715
02:00:51,923 --> 02:00:52,723
Tell us more.

1716
02:00:52,803 --> 02:00:56,643
Listen. Your husband got killed.

1717
02:00:56,763 --> 02:00:59,523
Tell us what had happened?

1718
02:00:59,723 --> 02:01:01,883
Your husband was Dwarka.

1719
02:01:02,083 --> 02:01:04,203
He used to drink.

1720
02:01:04,363 --> 02:01:06,490
He got into trouble.

1721
02:01:06,570 --> 02:01:08,285
How could he save
himself from the enmity?

1722
02:01:08,901 --> 02:01:12,083
You're right. That enmity
resulted in his death.

1723
02:01:12,163 --> 02:01:13,763
He was great.

1724
02:01:13,963 --> 02:01:15,563
He was drunk.

1725
02:01:15,763 --> 02:01:17,403
He poked the knife in his body.

1726
02:01:17,483 --> 02:01:19,123
He landed in trouble.

1727
02:01:19,563 --> 02:01:20,803
What did he go through?

1728
02:01:21,163 --> 02:01:22,963
You know everything.

1729
02:01:23,243 --> 02:01:24,247
I know.

1730
02:01:24,452 --> 02:01:25,749
I've come here.

1731
02:01:25,829 --> 02:01:30,083
You asked me. Glory to lord.

1732
02:01:30,163 --> 02:01:36,772
Glory to lord.

1733
02:01:36,852 --> 02:01:38,723
Madam..
Bajrangi is here.

1734
02:01:39,163 --> 02:01:40,803
He says he has some important work.

1735
02:01:42,763 --> 02:01:43,963
Do come again.

1736
02:01:46,483 --> 02:01:47,603
Bajrangi?

1737
02:01:47,843 --> 02:01:52,323
This Bajrangi is from where?

1738
02:01:52,403 --> 02:01:54,203
Why are you asking us?

1739
02:01:54,283 --> 02:01:56,883
Ask your astrology.

1740
02:01:57,363 --> 02:01:58,563
You don't trouble him.

1741
02:01:59,363 --> 02:02:01,003
He has come from Banaras.

1742
02:02:01,683 --> 02:02:03,323
Got his injured father along.

1743
02:02:03,603 --> 02:02:06,123
There are ulcers in my feet.

1744
02:02:06,323 --> 02:02:11,003
I want to felicitate the great person.

1745
02:02:11,363 --> 02:02:13,323
I will wash his feet
and drink that water.

1746
02:02:18,803 --> 02:02:22,323
Thirty thousand, I had got from home.

1747
02:02:22,923 --> 02:02:25,283
I have given twenty two thousand
to the jeweller for her ornaments.

1748
02:02:26,123 --> 02:02:27,723
And these are remaining
eight thousand rupees.

1749
02:02:28,123 --> 02:02:29,723
So much cash you keep carrying.

1750
02:02:30,203 --> 02:02:32,563
I hope you don't cheat on your master.

1751
02:02:34,563 --> 02:02:36,003
I had even one more thing to tell you.

1752
02:02:36,083 --> 02:02:36,923
Bajrangi.

1753
02:02:38,203 --> 02:02:39,803
Answer my question first.

1754
02:02:41,763 --> 02:02:43,883
If I were fond of jewels..

1755
02:02:45,083 --> 02:02:46,443
..then I might have cheated.

1756
02:02:46,523 --> 02:02:48,523
Don't even question of his honesty.

1757
02:02:49,243 --> 02:02:51,643
I trust him more than myself.

1758
02:02:52,443 --> 02:02:55,523
Since he has come he has
been a great support to me.

1759
02:02:55,763 --> 02:02:57,963
He is looking after
the business so well.

1760
02:02:58,643 --> 02:03:00,603
Those other businessmen
do not recognize me at all.

1761
02:03:02,043 --> 02:03:03,323
You were going to say something.

1762
02:03:04,203 --> 02:03:05,363
I will someday.

1763
02:03:05,483 --> 02:03:08,603
Why are you shy saying
it in front of me?

1764
02:03:09,203 --> 02:03:10,403
Not shy.

1765
02:03:11,283 --> 02:03:14,443
But you might not like it.

1766
02:03:18,243 --> 02:03:20,483
This will result in sneezes
and won't kill mosquitoes.

1767
02:03:27,803 --> 02:03:31,563
It'll get rid of
all evil spirits, my son.

1768
02:03:31,643 --> 02:03:33,163
We don't have anything.

1769
02:03:34,603 --> 02:03:36,483
Don't sneeze. It'll scare the smoke.

1770
02:03:36,923 --> 02:03:38,163
Go away from here.

1771
02:03:38,243 --> 02:03:40,563
Oh no!

1772
02:03:40,763 --> 02:03:44,763
"Sneeze and say.."

1773
02:03:44,843 --> 02:03:47,443
"Sneeze and say."

1774
02:03:47,523 --> 02:03:49,683
Where are you hiding?

1775
02:03:49,763 --> 02:03:54,643
"I can reveal the secret in hearts."

1776
02:03:55,803 --> 02:03:58,283
"Sneeze and say who's hidden inside"

1777
02:03:58,363 --> 02:04:00,683
"I'll find him
and reveal the secrets."

1778
02:04:02,083 --> 02:04:02,803
Listen.

1779
02:04:03,123 --> 02:04:06,003
Move out you will get what you want.

1780
02:04:06,083 --> 02:04:07,843
Whatever is there inside will come out.

1781
02:04:08,003 --> 02:04:10,363
And whatever will
come out will be known.

1782
02:04:11,163 --> 02:04:12,843
But you move out first.

1783
02:04:12,923 --> 02:04:17,083
Call me uncle.

1784
02:04:17,323 --> 02:04:18,563
He is a saint.

1785
02:04:18,683 --> 02:04:19,483
He winks.

1786
02:04:19,563 --> 02:04:22,483
The devotee of Bhawani
from Kashi winks and speaks.

1787
02:04:22,563 --> 02:04:25,883
The world is two-faced.
Why do you call yourself Bajrangi?

1788
02:04:26,123 --> 02:04:26,883
Bajrangi.

1789
02:04:27,283 --> 02:04:29,163
Saint you are great.

1790
02:04:29,403 --> 02:04:30,683
I will get my Lata.

1791
02:04:30,763 --> 02:04:32,683
You tell her my feelings.

1792
02:04:32,763 --> 02:04:35,763
Okay make it fast.

1793
02:04:35,843 --> 02:04:38,643
Lata.

1794
02:04:43,043 --> 02:04:44,123
In this attire..

1795
02:04:44,243 --> 02:04:47,443
..don't I look like
Nawab's court dancer?

1796
02:04:47,923 --> 02:04:53,043
"That which had pictures of love".

1797
02:04:53,123 --> 02:04:58,443
"I broke that mirror".

1798
02:05:00,403 --> 02:05:05,523
"I broke that mirror".

1799
02:05:07,563 --> 02:05:12,443
"Learnt to live smiling".

1800
02:05:12,643 --> 02:05:17,683
"Gave up dying slowly".

1801
02:05:19,843 --> 02:05:24,883
"Gave up dying slowly".

1802
02:05:41,083 --> 02:05:45,643
"What is the voice of heart".

1803
02:05:45,923 --> 02:05:48,323
"Don't know what the secret is'.

1804
02:05:48,403 --> 02:05:52,843
"What is the voice of heart".

1805
02:05:53,203 --> 02:05:57,643
"Don't know what the secret is'.

1806
02:05:58,043 --> 02:06:03,003
"If somebody asks me".

1807
02:06:03,283 --> 02:06:08,003
"Getting scared of
the sorrows in my destiny".

1808
02:06:08,083 --> 02:06:13,643
"Changed the path of life".

1809
02:06:15,243 --> 02:06:19,803
"That what had pictures of love".

1810
02:06:19,963 --> 02:06:25,003
"I broke that mirror".

1811
02:06:26,963 --> 02:06:31,843
"I broke that mirror".

1812
02:06:36,763 --> 02:06:38,323
But today after such a long time.

1813
02:06:38,843 --> 02:06:39,563
How come you danced?

1814
02:06:39,643 --> 02:06:42,443
Nobody can predict
what Laila may do and when.

1815
02:06:43,763 --> 02:06:46,323
Laila's truth is not correct.

1816
02:06:46,723 --> 02:06:48,243
Don't pay heed to it.

1817
02:06:48,523 --> 02:06:49,683
So, you don't want me to trust you.

1818
02:06:50,483 --> 02:06:51,123
Why?

1819
02:06:51,563 --> 02:06:55,403
Because I have no control on myself.

1820
02:06:56,283 --> 02:06:58,883
What if suddenly I leave
everything and go away?

1821
02:06:59,083 --> 02:06:59,723
Where will you go?

1822
02:07:00,843 --> 02:07:01,763
Anywhere.

1823
02:07:03,043 --> 02:07:03,843
With whom?

1824
02:07:05,523 --> 02:07:06,363
Why will I tell you?

1825
02:07:07,803 --> 02:07:09,203
Quite possible..

1826
02:07:09,803 --> 02:07:11,243
..I might run away with Bajrangi.

1827
02:07:13,323 --> 02:07:15,083
If it Bajrangi then it is not possible.

1828
02:07:15,443 --> 02:07:17,683
You trust him so much?

1829
02:07:18,083 --> 02:07:19,443
How is he related to you?

1830
02:07:19,763 --> 02:07:20,643
He is no one.

1831
02:07:22,163 --> 02:07:23,203
But still I feel him close to me.

1832
02:07:24,003 --> 02:07:24,723
Is it?

1833
02:07:25,403 --> 02:07:26,763
And how about me?

1834
02:07:26,843 --> 02:07:28,283
You know this better.

1835
02:07:29,643 --> 02:07:31,963
If you know about mine
and Bajrangi's real character..

1836
02:07:32,283 --> 02:07:34,083
..the you will surprised.

1837
02:07:34,483 --> 02:07:35,123
I didn't get you.

1838
02:07:35,923 --> 02:07:36,723
What do you mean?

1839
02:07:37,603 --> 02:07:39,723
Bajrangi is guarding you at every stage.

1840
02:07:40,323 --> 02:07:41,043
And me..

1841
02:07:41,243 --> 02:07:42,803
..I am used at every stage.

1842
02:07:43,683 --> 02:07:45,003
He is your good deed..

1843
02:07:45,643 --> 02:07:46,763
..and I am your sin.

1844
02:08:14,683 --> 02:08:20,363
My brother died and you are still alive?

1845
02:08:23,043 --> 02:08:24,803
I was scared by Mr. Dwarka's death.

1846
02:08:24,883 --> 02:08:27,443
Why have you come here?

1847
02:08:28,523 --> 02:08:30,163
I've heard that
Kundan is in Calcutta.

1848
02:08:30,243 --> 02:08:32,723
You're lying to save yourself.
Get out.

1849
02:08:53,723 --> 02:08:56,443
Anybody around?
Catch the man. He shouldn't escape.

1850
02:09:12,963 --> 02:09:14,523
Kundan is definitely in Calcutta.

1851
02:09:14,923 --> 02:09:20,483
Caught him. caught him.

1852
02:09:25,683 --> 02:09:28,723
You killed Belly to stop him
from giving information about Kundan?

1853
02:09:28,803 --> 02:09:29,483
Yes.

1854
02:09:29,843 --> 02:09:32,083
I have served Bhavaniprasad honestly.

1855
02:09:32,803 --> 02:09:36,003
Till the time there
is blood in my body..

1856
02:09:36,243 --> 02:09:38,883
..nobody can harm Kundan.

1857
02:09:39,043 --> 02:09:40,803
You don't know Ganeshi.

1858
02:09:41,123 --> 02:09:43,643
Even your angels will
tell where Kundan is.

1859
02:09:43,723 --> 02:09:48,283
You try your best.

1860
02:09:49,043 --> 02:09:51,123
You cut me into pieces.

1861
02:09:51,523 --> 02:09:54,163
But you won't know about Kundan.

1862
02:09:55,643 --> 02:09:57,883
What happened?

1863
02:09:58,323 --> 02:09:59,123
Mother.

1864
02:09:59,763 --> 02:10:01,403
Mother I felt..

1865
02:10:01,483 --> 02:10:03,643
..as if Kundan soaked
in blood is standing before me.

1866
02:10:03,843 --> 02:10:05,163
No mother.

1867
02:10:19,363 --> 02:10:22,963
Tell me.

1868
02:10:24,803 --> 02:10:27,523
Where is Kundan,
otherwise I won't leave you alive.

1869
02:10:28,203 --> 02:10:31,603
If I survive, I won't leave you alive.

1870
02:10:32,363 --> 02:10:34,763
That time I had left you for Kundan.

1871
02:10:35,603 --> 02:10:37,483
Otherwise instead of Belly..

1872
02:10:37,963 --> 02:10:40,363
..would have killed you.

1873
02:10:40,883 --> 02:10:41,923
Beat him.

1874
02:10:42,803 --> 02:10:44,083
He will kill you.

1875
02:10:44,163 --> 02:10:46,443
You want him to kill Bhim uncle?

1876
02:10:46,643 --> 02:10:49,163
And I hide here like a coward?

1877
02:10:49,443 --> 02:10:51,843
I won't let Bhim uncle fall in trouble.

1878
02:10:51,923 --> 02:10:53,963
No. -Get aside.

1879
02:10:54,043 --> 02:10:54,843
Kundan.

1880
02:10:56,603 --> 02:10:57,563
Uncle Bhim.

1881
02:10:58,483 --> 02:10:59,283
Uncle Bhim..

1882
02:11:01,723 --> 02:11:02,603
It's me.

1883
02:11:04,043 --> 02:11:05,683
I'm Kundan, uncle Bhim.

1884
02:11:34,203 --> 02:11:36,003
Why did you come here?

1885
02:11:36,243 --> 02:11:37,803
How could I leave you alone?

1886
02:11:37,963 --> 02:11:38,843
Go away from here.

1887
02:11:39,443 --> 02:11:41,443
If Ganeshi's men see us,
we will be in trouble.

1888
02:11:42,723 --> 02:11:45,883
Two! Here you so.

1889
02:11:46,283 --> 02:11:48,563
See if that Bhim is alert or not.

1890
02:11:48,643 --> 02:11:50,963
He's a tough guy.

1891
02:12:18,603 --> 02:12:20,563
I will carry this bed sheet to Ganeshi.

1892
02:12:20,643 --> 02:12:23,243
Why are you carrying this bed sheet?

1893
02:12:23,443 --> 02:12:26,803
I will show this to him.

1894
02:12:27,243 --> 02:12:29,603
And will force him to..

1895
02:12:30,083 --> 02:12:32,323
..save my son's life.

1896
02:12:32,403 --> 02:12:35,123
I myself will go to him.

1897
02:12:35,243 --> 02:12:37,243
Today this enmity will come to an end.

1898
02:12:37,323 --> 02:12:39,043
No.

1899
02:12:39,123 --> 02:12:41,043
He will kill you.

1900
02:12:41,483 --> 02:12:44,283
I have spent my entire life crying.

1901
02:12:45,123 --> 02:12:49,203
Have mercy on your widower mother.

1902
02:12:49,483 --> 02:12:51,203
You have given birth to me.

1903
02:12:51,523 --> 02:12:54,323
Then encourage me to live bravely.

1904
02:12:54,403 --> 02:12:58,683
Kundan!- Mother, stop him from going.

1905
02:12:59,203 --> 02:13:01,283
Son! Son, please don't go.

1906
02:13:01,803 --> 02:13:03,234
I've vowed to protect you.

1907
02:13:03,314 --> 02:13:06,883
Nothing will happen to me. Let me go.
- Son!

1908
02:13:24,843 --> 02:13:26,403
Take this back.

1909
02:13:28,163 --> 02:13:30,003
Give me my prisoner back.

1910
02:13:31,483 --> 02:13:32,523
I didn't get you.

1911
02:13:32,963 --> 02:13:36,403
I know and you know the
meaning of releasing Bhim.

1912
02:13:37,683 --> 02:13:39,923
Where is he?

1913
02:13:40,363 --> 02:13:42,123
Who?
- Kundan.

1914
02:13:45,203 --> 02:13:46,763
How are you related to Kundan?

1915
02:13:47,163 --> 02:13:49,603
What will you get by knowing it?

1916
02:13:49,683 --> 02:13:53,083
I want to know about the character of
people who are betraying me in my house.

1917
02:13:53,163 --> 02:13:54,803
You are forgetting.

1918
02:13:54,883 --> 02:13:56,563
This is my house.

1919
02:13:56,643 --> 02:13:57,803
I can keep whom so ever I want to.

1920
02:13:59,443 --> 02:14:00,683
Kundan is here?

1921
02:14:01,763 --> 02:14:02,803
In this house?

1922
02:14:03,963 --> 02:14:04,603
Not in this house.

1923
02:14:05,083 --> 02:14:05,803
He is in my heart.

1924
02:14:06,363 --> 02:14:07,163
In my eyes.

1925
02:14:07,243 --> 02:14:08,323
You betrayer.

1926
02:14:08,923 --> 02:14:11,243
What am I hearing?

1927
02:14:11,323 --> 02:14:13,123
This is your Laila's voice.

1928
02:14:13,523 --> 02:14:15,363
This is Kundan's Munni's voice.

1929
02:14:15,883 --> 02:14:17,643
I love Kundan.

1930
02:14:17,723 --> 02:14:19,403
And I have loved
him since I was a child.

1931
02:14:19,483 --> 02:14:20,243
Laila.

1932
02:14:20,323 --> 02:14:22,323
If my life is of any use to Kundan..

1933
02:14:22,403 --> 02:14:23,963
..then I will think
I got married to him.

1934
02:14:24,043 --> 02:14:26,483
I won't kill you so easily.

1935
02:14:27,003 --> 02:14:31,083
I will kill him in to pieces,
for he killed my brother.

1936
02:14:31,323 --> 02:14:32,763
He snatched my love from me.

1937
02:14:34,083 --> 02:14:37,123
Where is that coward who
took a woman's help to attack me?

1938
02:14:37,443 --> 02:14:39,203
You had come to take
the support of a woman.

1939
02:14:39,283 --> 02:14:40,683
Shut up!

1940
02:14:41,243 --> 02:14:43,283
Fallen woman!
- No!

1941
02:14:44,003 --> 02:14:48,283
Kundan? No.

1942
02:14:55,043 --> 02:14:57,083
Kundan go away from here.

1943
02:14:57,163 --> 02:15:00,123
Go away, otherwise he will kill you.

1944
02:15:01,483 --> 02:15:03,363
Why did you stop Kundan?

1945
02:15:04,363 --> 02:15:05,483
Come in the light.

1946
02:15:06,403 --> 02:15:10,163
Let me see the face of that sinner,
by killing whom..

1947
02:15:10,643 --> 02:15:13,003
..today my oath will be accomplished.

1948
02:15:25,083 --> 02:15:26,043
Bajrangi.

1949
02:15:26,563 --> 02:15:27,603
Yes master.

1950
02:15:28,843 --> 02:15:29,683
I am Kundan.

1951
02:15:52,683 --> 02:15:56,123
I am the grandson of your
father's killer Bhavaniprasad.

1952
02:15:57,163 --> 02:15:59,803
The one for whom you
had taken an oath to kill.

1953
02:16:00,803 --> 02:16:03,123
I have fulfilled my duties master.

1954
02:16:03,563 --> 02:16:05,603
You fulfill your promise.

1955
02:16:06,083 --> 02:16:07,683
Was this your duty?

1956
02:16:08,203 --> 02:16:11,323
To keep attacking me secretly?

1957
02:16:12,123 --> 02:16:14,363
To slowly add poison to my happiness.

1958
02:16:14,443 --> 02:16:17,723
I have always tried to serve you.

1959
02:16:18,323 --> 02:16:20,723
And have always tried
to protect your happiness.

1960
02:16:20,803 --> 02:16:22,483
You have only protected yourself.

1961
02:16:22,563 --> 02:16:24,243
You kept serving me for..

1962
02:16:24,403 --> 02:16:26,643
..when I realise that you are Kundan..

1963
02:16:26,723 --> 02:16:29,323
..then I might forgive
you and leave you.

1964
02:16:29,643 --> 02:16:32,043
You had no guts to stand in front of me.

1965
02:16:32,243 --> 02:16:34,203
Yes, I had no guts.

1966
02:16:34,283 --> 02:16:36,363
To stand in front of
a brother being his enemy.

1967
02:16:37,363 --> 02:16:40,563
And now I am tired of living this way.

1968
02:16:41,963 --> 02:16:43,363
You take my life.

1969
02:16:43,643 --> 02:16:46,523
But you please release
me from this old enmity.

1970
02:16:46,763 --> 02:16:49,003
You will never get released from this.

1971
02:16:49,083 --> 02:16:51,163
I cannot let you go easily.

1972
02:16:52,683 --> 02:16:57,323
I can still see my father's dead body
in front of my eyes, floating in Ganga.

1973
02:16:59,203 --> 02:17:01,603
I can still feel Dwarka's..

1974
02:17:01,843 --> 02:17:03,763
..lost breaths.

1975
02:17:03,843 --> 02:17:06,163
And I have embraced them.

1976
02:17:06,963 --> 02:17:09,763
He had forgiven me.

1977
02:17:10,603 --> 02:17:12,843
And keeping the same emotions
in mind I came to you..

1978
02:17:12,923 --> 02:17:15,363
But it is my misfortune that
Dwarka couldn't tell you anything.

1979
02:17:15,443 --> 02:17:21,083
You are lying to save your life.

1980
02:17:21,883 --> 02:17:24,083
You had killed Dwarka.

1981
02:17:24,163 --> 02:17:24,803
You killed him.

1982
02:17:24,883 --> 02:17:25,883
Uncle Bhim.

1983
02:17:26,883 --> 02:17:29,203
Get aside.

1984
02:17:29,283 --> 02:17:31,523
Let me kill him.

1985
02:17:35,883 --> 02:17:37,723
Uncle Bhim.

1986
02:17:38,283 --> 02:17:39,163
Uncle Bhim.

1987
02:17:39,563 --> 02:17:40,483
Uncle Bhim.

1988
02:17:43,123 --> 02:17:44,443
Uncle Bhim.

1989
02:17:44,923 --> 02:17:46,843
Uncle Bhim.

1990
02:17:49,283 --> 02:17:51,843
What did I do?

1991
02:17:52,243 --> 02:17:54,723
The person for which I was surviving..

1992
02:17:55,003 --> 02:17:58,443
..I killed the same person.

1993
02:17:58,963 --> 02:18:00,363
No Kundan..

1994
02:18:01,603 --> 02:18:03,243
..God had mercy on me.

1995
02:18:04,563 --> 02:18:06,243
That he let my life..

1996
02:18:07,083 --> 02:18:08,843
..be taken for you.

1997
02:18:09,603 --> 02:18:14,043
No, I was getting rid
of grandfather's sins.

1998
02:18:14,723 --> 02:18:18,523
But I end up committing another sin.

1999
02:18:18,963 --> 02:18:23,003
C'mon tell me. Why did you
make me commit one more sin, uncle?

2000
02:18:27,043 --> 02:18:29,483
Don't cry.

2001
02:18:29,563 --> 02:18:33,203
This must be the good deed of the past.

2002
02:18:33,483 --> 02:18:37,203
That I got killed by my son.

2003
02:18:38,163 --> 02:18:39,403
Uncle.

2004
02:18:39,803 --> 02:18:40,883
Uncle.

2005
02:19:22,643 --> 02:19:24,163
Take this master.

2006
02:19:25,163 --> 02:19:28,083
The knife having the
blood of my ancestors.

2007
02:19:28,723 --> 02:19:30,483
Insert it in my chest.

2008
02:19:32,443 --> 02:19:33,812
I don't want a life..

2009
02:19:33,892 --> 02:19:36,803
..where I will be called to have
done a good deed by killing people.

2010
02:19:38,043 --> 02:19:41,963
You please release me from this
struggle between Good deeds and sins.

2011
02:19:42,643 --> 02:19:44,723
Release me master.

2012
02:19:45,283 --> 02:19:47,203
Release me.

2013
02:20:07,283 --> 02:20:08,283
Munni.

2014
02:20:11,123 --> 02:20:13,163
I have got that thing
from your door step..

2015
02:20:13,923 --> 02:20:15,763
..which I had never thought
of even in my dreams.

2016
02:20:17,003 --> 02:20:18,483
I got my brother back.

2017
02:20:19,723 --> 02:20:21,123
I got Dwarka back.

2018
02:20:52,003 --> 02:20:55,043
This bed sheet has the
blood of that innocent person..

2019
02:20:55,523 --> 02:20:58,283
Who was killed for the
race between sin and good deeds.

2020
02:20:59,523 --> 02:21:00,683
Dwarka.

2021
02:21:01,163 --> 02:21:06,203
I want to pack the enmity in this bed
sheet and want to throw it in the Ganga.

2022
02:21:19,723 --> 02:21:25,803
"Forgiveness mellows down anger."

2023
02:21:26,163 --> 02:21:34,563
"When you show it to others."

2024
02:21:34,923 --> 02:21:43,403
"Saint Kabir tells his disciples.."

2025
02:21:43,723 --> 02:21:50,923
"Nobody can win in anger."
