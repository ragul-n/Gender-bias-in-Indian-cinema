1
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,840
Shiva!

2
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,800
Ey...Shiva!

3
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,880
Shiva.

4
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,080
Oh my God!

5
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,560
Shiva!

6
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,560
4 Youngsters who were
on a trek this evening,

7
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,840
were caught in a fire accident.

8
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,240
From which 3 are
suspected to be dead---

9
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,360
---along which Shiva,
a football player

10
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,840
has been admitted at the
hospital due to severe injury.

11
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,400
Pertaining to it, the
Forest Ranger---

12
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,680
---is inquiring to find out if
the fire occurred naturally

13
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,560
or it's a work of
anti-social elements.

14
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,400
Please sit down.

15
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,480
I'm so sorry.

16
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,000
You son's face have been severely
damaged due to the fire.

17
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,440
Usually patients
with 20-30% burn

18
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,280
we can graft using the skin
from their thighs or back.

19
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,520
But your son's face
has 90% burns.

20
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,400
Savithri!

21
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,720
Savithri.

22
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,640
-If so,
-Nothing would've happened

23
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,520
will he remain like
this his whole life.

24
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,480
Ma'am please calm down.

25
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,160
Be brave!

26
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,880
You please relax for a moment.

27
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,880
Don't be scared.

28
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,160
There's nothing to be worried.

29
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,440
There's another option
for such critical cases.

30
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,360
Face Transplant.

31
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,440
What is that Doctor?

32
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,080
Let me explain.

33
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,520
Look at him.

34
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,040
His name is Richard.

35
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,240
Pretty much your son's face---

36
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,680
---is damaged to this extent.

37
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,400
If you look at him, he's
a critical patient.

38
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:35,440
so, when he was on his death bed

39
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,280
so, when he was on his death bed

40
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,360
his face was used for
Richard's transplant.

41
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,040
Eye donation, heart donation---

42
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,080
---kidney donation

43
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,040
just like that, we need a
donor for this as well.

44
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,720
I know a patient,

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,040
he was admitted 6 months ago
suffering from an accident.

46
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,080
he was admitted 6 months ago
suffering from an accident.

47
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,840
And lately his pulse
is coming down.

48
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,560
He is at present Brain Dead.

49
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,680
chances of survival
are very less.

50
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,160
If his blood relation
agree to donate,

51
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,520
this transplant could happen.

52
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,960
We can perform a surgery.

53
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,720
And one more important thing

54
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,600
when this treatment is
going, make sure your son

55
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,080
doesn't look into mirror

56
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,000
or any reflective objects,
will be better for him.

57
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,240
He'll be heartbroken.

58
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,560
Ahhh...Ah!

59
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,840
Oh no!

60
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,160
Your son is brain dead now.

61
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,280
The heart is slowly giving away.

62
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,480
Can't really say, how
long he'll be alive.

63
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,160
I shouldn't be
bringing this up now,

64
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,880
But I don't have an option

65
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,240
If you agree to it,

66
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,240
you can donate organs.

67
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,200
Madam...Madam!

68
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,280
If you help us with this---

69
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,840
---your son

70
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,720
will continue to live
even after his death.

71
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,640
Please Madam!

72
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,760
Please Madam!

73
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,680
Please Madam.

74
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,680
For God sake, please
do this favour for us.

Thanks a lot Doctor.

98
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,120
In the case of patients
with 20-30% burns,

99
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:41,200
we could ideally take the
skin from the patient's

100
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,480
we could ideally take the
skin from the patient's

101
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,960
back or thigh for the graft.

102
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,360
Right!?

103
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,760
But in the case of Mr.Shiva---

104
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,320
Booo!

105
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,600
Get in...

106
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,280
Get inside Son...

107
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,840
Good morning Ma!

108
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,880
Did you just wake up?

109
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,920
Mmmm!...Why do you
have a picture of me?

110
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:17,920
Listen---

111
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,160
---when you're home

112
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,840
feels like some stranger
is in the house.

113
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,400
That's the reason, I'm
getting your face imprinted

114
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,920
Why do you need a
picture for that?

115
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,240
Look closely---

116
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,760
---this is my new face.

117
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,040
Look!...Look!...Looook!

118
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,600
Look!...Look!...Looook!

119
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,040
Get lost!

120
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,120
Brother, can you please drop
me at college, just today.

121
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,200
What's this new habit? When
have I ever dropped you?

122
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,200
Until yesterday, you were
an average looking guy.

123
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,120
But now, you've turned
into an handsome hunk.

124
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,000
Thought of introducing
you to my friends.

125
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,640
-Ok fine, I'll drop you
-Ey...!

126
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,640
Ah...Ah! come on
stop the vehicle.

127
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,320
Pull over.

128
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:56,920
Take out your driving license.

129
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:56,960
Get it insured, come on next.

130
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,560
Get it insured, come on next.

131
00:12:59,880 --> 00:12:59,920
Don't worry, just a minute.

132
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,840
Don't worry, just a minute.

133
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,000
Here take this Sir.

134
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,920
Hey! are you kidding with me?

135
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,120
Give me your driving license.

136
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,440
That's my license, Sir.

137
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,640
Is that yours?

138
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,680
The picture on this is
different from what you look?

139
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:13,960
A face transplant was done,
'cause I was in an accident.

140
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,880
A face transplant was done,
'cause I was in an accident.

141
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,120
they've done a re-construction surgery
of the face with skin grafting

142
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,760
my jaw line has also been
completely replaced, Sir.

143
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,800
Since they did it by
Flap Surgery & Suture---

144
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,160
---I don't understand
what you're saying.

145
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,240
Give me 50 bucks.

146
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:27,800
Huh!?

147
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,880
If you have 50 bucks,
just pay up and leave.

148
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,440
-Listen
-Huh!?

149
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,120
Wasn't it Shanthi, who was acting
as daughter-in-law until yesterday?

150
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,480
Ya.

151
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,240
How come there's another actress
as daughter-in-law today?

152
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,920
How can we agree to it?

153
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,760
Can't agree, it's
totally unfair.

154
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,600
Why, until last week you saw
your son as someone else.

155
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,000
now you see him in a
different avatar.

156
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,320
Just like that.

157
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:48,440
You have to adapt.

158
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,760
You have to adapt.

159
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,560
You're right Dad.

160
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,240
Hey!

161
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,360
Dad, change the channel.

162
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,880
Aren't you home just jobless!?

163
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,760
Can't you at least
change these batteries?

164
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,680
Hello!

165
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,000
Hey, where are you?

166
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,040
Hey, who is this?

167
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,720
It's me Shiva.

168
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,800
Oh Mirchi Shiva!

169
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,600
Brother, I watched
Tamizh Padam 2

170
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,040
your performance was
extraordinary.

171
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,960
Moreover, the guy who played
the part of a villain,

172
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,080
whatta performance!

173
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,680
whatta performance!

174
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,760
Just one regret,

175
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,560
that he lost to you in
a dance competition.

176
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,560
That was not convincing.

177
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:17,600
Hey idiot, it's me
your friend Shiva.

178
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,520
Hey idiot, it's me
your friend Shiva.

179
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,440
Oh it's you, tell me
how are you buddy.

180
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,320
You were missing for a month, and
your phone was switched off.

181
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,800
That's right buddy, I'm
not jobless as you.

182
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,160
I was in Dubai last month.

183
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,680
I just got back to Chennai, will
be leaving to Bangkok tonight.

184
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,560
Ok fine, where are you now?
Come home.

185
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,840
Home!? which one?

186
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,160
The one surrounded by sludge,

187
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,520
a water tanker
parked on the road

188
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,440
also two buffaloes guarding it
all the time, is that the one?

189
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,640
I can't come over,

190
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,680
speak to me over the phone.

191
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,000
Are you free now?

192
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,840
Tell me where are you?
I'll come there myself.

193
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,160
Free and me!?

194
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,480
9-10, warm up with
my girlfriend.

195
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,000
10-12, I have to sell foreign
goods at Burma Bazaar.

196
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,800
1-2, a small break

197
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,800
of course with a chick.

198
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,480
3-4, for these pervert uncles---

199
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:55,560
---I have to supply
***** **** capsules.

200
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,680
---I have to supply
***** **** capsules.

201
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,000
Post which I'll leave
to Bangkok tonight

202
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,160
I wasted 3 minutes of my life

203
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,720
by speaking to you
over the phone.

204
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,400
Hang up, damn it.

205
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,200
Hey...Hey!

206
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,680
Brother, is Gopal
showing off too much?

207
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,160
I'll take care of him.

208
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,400
Gopal, don't go abroad
leaving me here alone.

209
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,520
please take me with you

210
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:13,800
Why would I take you to Bangkok?

211
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,960
Why would I take you to Bangkok?

212
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,680
Hold on, someone's at the
door, I'll check who's it.

213
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,360
Wonder who is at the door.

214
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,560
Central Bureau of Investigation!

215
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,440
Bureau at Central!?

216
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:26,920
CBI!

217
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,320
CBI officer!

218
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,560
Why are you here?

219
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,520
We got information, that you're being
mischievous with a girl in broad daylight,

220
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:32,920
Sir, it's a TV show.
A TV show.

221
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,080
Sir, it's a TV show.
A TV show.

222
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:35,960
TV Show!?

223
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,680
What show?

224
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,680
"Wedding Night at our House"

225
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,880
We will select 16 girls,

226
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,920
I'll hug them all

227
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,720
will select 3 from them
who are best at hugging,

228
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,240
out of which I'll
get married to one.

229
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,240
Are you going to get
married to her?

230
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,240
No Sir. If I get married to her,
the other two will be hurt.

231
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,600
in order not to spoil
their friendship

232
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,800
I won't get married to here.

233
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,200
Don't keep staring, I can't marry you.
Get lost.

234
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:56,720
Get lost...!

235
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,480
Please leave.

236
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,960
Hey, who are you trying to cheat?

237
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,000
Cheat!?

238
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,920
Cheat!?

239
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,640
You're under arrest!

240
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,880
Hello Sir! I'm from
a respected family.

241
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,640
You really!?

242
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,040
I'm well aware of your respect.

243
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:06,640
What do you know?

244
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:06,680
9-10, meeting with the girls.

245
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,200
9-10, meeting with the girls.

246
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,200
10-12, selling foreign
goods at Burma Bazaar.

247
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,920
12-1, exchange currencies.

248
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,040
1-2, chilling with the chicks.

249
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,920
3-4, supplying energy
capsules to the old guys.

250
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,080
Then finally at 6 leave
to Bangkok on a flight.

251
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,840
Isn't this your plan?

252
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,880
Sir, you're a great
CBI officer---

253
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,320
---you have accurate
information on me.

254
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,680
Look there a white crow!

255
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,400
White Crow!?

256
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,560
Nirmala Devi is out there---

257
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:25,720
-Where?
-You guys get distracted by her name

258
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,400
-Where?
-You guys get distracted by her name

259
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,480
Buddy, I'm in deep trouble.

260
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,560
CBI seemed to have overheard our
conversation in the morning.

261
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,080
CBI is chasing me, what do I do?

262
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,160
Where are you right now?

263
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,360
I'm at the double
tank near KK Nagar.

264
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,280
A water tanker just passed by

265
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,640
take a left and proceed
to your right.

266
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,240
right is it!? fine.

267
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,480
Greens...Greens!

268
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,200
Where do I go now?

269
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:46,960
Where are you now?

270
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,160
A lady who looks like Chris
Gayle is selling greens.

271
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,560
there's an ugly looking
house here too

272
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:51,600
Get into that house

273
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,520
Get into that house

274
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,600
it's your house damn it.

275
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,320
Get inside.

276
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,720
I can hear Siren

277
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,520
hope they don't shoot me down.

278
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,240
Buddy, I'm in---

279
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,880
I'm knocking, no one
is answering the door

280
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,920
Don't walk slow like an old
hag, open the door. Quick!

281
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,320
-What is it?
-Open the door, quick!

282
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,000
When my son called
you in the morning,

283
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,560
there's sludge around the house

284
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,360
street buzzing with water tanker

285
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:11,960
I can't open the door, get lost.

286
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,040
This is not the time to avenge,

287
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,600
CBI is on tail, my life is
in danger, open the door.

288
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:14,640
Fine, come inside.

289
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,560
Fine, come inside.

290
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,200
I'm finally inside the house.

291
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,440
Sir...CBI Sir!

292
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,040
Ey...Ey...Ey...Ey!

293
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,920
-My legs...
-You're faster than a GPS.

294
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,000
If you had show such eagerness,

295
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,680
If you had show such eagerness,

296
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,080
on the people who swindle
millions and evade

297
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,640
would've been great if
you had caught them.

298
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:31,720
I just hugged a girl,

299
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,920
I just hugged a girl,

300
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,960
I didn't even touch her cheeks.

301
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,040
Why are so eager to catch me?

302
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,400
Why are so eager to catch me?

303
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,720
Hey idiot, It's me.

304
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,480
Who!?

305
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,560
It's my brother, Gopal.

306
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,400
His face was damaged
in a fire accident,

307
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,440
I called to let you know that.

308
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:41,480
Thankfully, we got a donor.

309
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,360
Thankfully, we got a donor.

310
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,720
So he has undergone a face
transplant surgery now.

311
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,600
Hey, that's right.
Can't you see?

312
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,520
Oh, is that why it looks a
zipper sewn to your face?

313
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,160
You're growing a
beard to hide that.

314
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,320
Still I'm not able
to believe this.

315
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,960
'Buddy come over here...!'

316
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,440
Ah...!

317
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,400
'Buy me a Quarter...'

318
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,880
'Mutton fry is the thing'

319
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,280
'Chase away the dogs'

320
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:10,360
-Buddy it's you!
-Come on, Come on.

321
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,520
-Buddy it's you!
-Come on, Come on.

322
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,160
Action!

323
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,880
I wish to live along
with you for a century.

324
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,160
Hello, what is this?

325
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,400
It's Tamizh, Tamizh!

326
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,120
Oh my God!

327
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,880
You're very beautiful.

328
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,880
I...just a minute

329
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,000
You're very....beautiful!

330
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,080
I wish to live with
you, for a century.

331
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:38,920
Action!

332
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,720
Pah!...you're very beautiful.

333
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,480
I like you very much.

334
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:41,920
Wish to live with you---

335
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,520
---If so, will live
a century with you.

336
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,440
What kind of guys
have you selected?

337
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,400
If you can't handle
casting, let it go

338
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,560
-I’ll take care of it.
-What!?

339
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,520
They seem to be good
in front of us.

340
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,240
But they're messing it
up, when they see you.

341
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,560
If you keep rejecting like this,

342
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,320
we just 10 days to shoot
and for post production

343
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,840
We're going to be
behind on schedule.

344
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,560
So!? Shouldn't it fit
as per the script?

345
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,800
I won't compromise.

346
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,520
Guys you're looking for, will
hang out at such hip clubs.

347
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,880
'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star---'

348
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,040
'Try licking the
pickle a bit---'

349
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,720
'Try licking the
pickle a bit---'

350
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,400
-Do you want pickle?
-Yes buddy!

351
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,280
Pickle right!?

352
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,720
Hello, do you have pickle?

353
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,800
Sir, we don't serve pickle.

354
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,920
Why do you look at pickle
with such low standards?

355
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,880
Are you kidding with me?

356
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,360
We've have paid so much, and
you don't seem to have pickle?

357
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,880
Ah!? Tell me why shouldn't
I call him * * * * *?

358
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,120
I will call him with that now.

359
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,760
Damn it, a departmental
store has pickle,

360
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,280
but you refuse to serve
pickle in a bar.

361
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,280
Don't piss me off.

362
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,080
Pickle is the staple food of our
country, you got to have it.

363
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,720
This is a conspiracy
by the corporates.

364
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:45,800
We shouldn't let this go.

365
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,040
We shouldn't let this go.

366
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,760
-We have to protest.
-This won't work out.

367
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,520
I'm scared looking at the bill,
that's why trying to manage.

368
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,760
I don't know what to do?

369
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:53,240
-See if you can find someone.
-I'll try to get some funds.

370
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,480
-See if you can find someone.
-I'll try to get some funds.

371
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,680
-How!?
-Just wait!

372
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:58,880
Ey..Ey!

373
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,640
He's charming!

374
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,560
Shall I go and ask him?

375
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,840
Don't ask them now,
they're sloshed

376
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,240
-please...please
-we'll talk to them in the morning

377
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,920
Buddy, take this.

378
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,960
I figured, he's here
to pick up chicks.

379
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,000
He will pick up,

380
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,400
but for him---

381
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,600
That's why, I gave
him a ******.

382
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,640
And that's how I got this money.

383
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,080
Let's go and ask him.

384
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:45,320
-Mmmm-hmmm
-I won't come

385
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,080
-Mmmm-hmmm
-I won't come

386
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,800
Fine, don't get too high.

387
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,920
-Let's leave
-Ok bye-bye!

388
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,160
You don't have to
bid him goodbye.

389
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,320
-He's leaving
-We'll take care of it tomorrow

390
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:53,600
Hey Gigi, I found
your short film lead,

391
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,200
Hey Gigi, I found
your short film lead,

392
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,280
I brought him with me.

393
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:57,920
Who!?

394
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,920
The guy from the club.

395
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,320
We're meeting him this evening.

396
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,040
Really!?

397
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,120
Come on, come on!

398
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,640
Defend---defend, go in

399
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,720
buddy it's through

400
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,800
gain on him, come on get in

401
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,360
Here, pass...pass.

402
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,760
Does your friend work here?

403
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,000
Our job is to prevent
crimes from happening.

404
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,080
Oh, are you cops?

405
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,840
Nah!

406
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,640
Take it we're working and
getting paid for it,

407
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,720
we keep that money
in our pockets.

408
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,640
If some thief picks our pockets,

409
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,120
unfortunately we create
a criminal there.

410
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,920
And if we happen to deposit
the same money in the bank---

411
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,600
---and that money will be
swindled by a businessman.

412
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,720
There we create an
international criminal.

413
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,800
Now these things didn't
happen 'cause of us.

414
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:38,640
That's why---

415
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,720
A silly excuse to be jobless.

416
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,760
Thanks for not saying
it on my face.

417
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,840
See, I don't blame you

418
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,440
You're being honest
that you like me.

419
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,440
I might fall in love with you,
also might get married to you

420
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,960
But in future when we go
out, people will look at us

421
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,840
and comment stating, girl is
good looking but the guy isn't.

422
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,080
I'll feel bad about it.

423
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,920
So, you don't take me wrong.

424
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,760
I'm taking this
decision for your sake.

425
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:13,920
Buddy!

426
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,800
Buddy!

427
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,680
Those girls are making
a short film---

428
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,920
---they want you
to play the lead.

429
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,800
Actually, they asked
me to play the part,

430
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,480
pass, pass, pass---

431
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,600
but it's the role of
a college student.

432
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:20,640
For that you should
be genuinely young.

433
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,320
For that you should
be genuinely young.

434
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,960
There are actors, who play that role even
when they're in their 40's and 50's.

435
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,440
And won't express their
love until the end.

436
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,680
-You must've seen it.
-Hey!

437
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,240
Buddy, please come on do it.

438
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,000
I can't do it, get lost.

439
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,680
It's not that buddy, the
girl who is with her

440
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,880
she seems to be interested
in me, that's why.

441
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,840
So please do it.

442
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:39,840
Oi!

443
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,480
Hi!

444
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:41,840
Come over here.

445
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,720
They're packed like
Bigg Boss contestants.

446
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,160
Hi!

447
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,000
I heard what you had
asked my friend,

448
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:50,520
Huh!?

449
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,360
Why do you have to make
films, while studying?

450
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,040
Doesn't your family
stop from doing it?

451
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,640
-Pass...pass
-Actually Sir

452
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,120
-we're Vis-Com students
-Can't you see they're talking

453
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,240
We're making this short film for
an International Film Festival.

454
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,520
I don't care what you do

455
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,600
I can't do it, I'm really busy.

456
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,360
pass, pass, pass.

457
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,880
Please don't say that

458
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,000
We'll fix the shoot
at your convenience.

459
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,160
How about yesterday?

460
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,720
Just for fun, ask them

461
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,120
Please Sir!

462
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,840
Go and get the ball

463
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,680
Sir!

464
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:14,640
Oi!

465
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,480
-Did I ask you?
-Mmm-Hmm.

466
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,440
You come and stand here.

467
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,360
You can come over here---

468
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,400
-go and get the ball.
-Smart!

469
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:22,960
Listen---

470
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,280
Ey---what is it?

471
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,800
You're at the peak
of unemployment

472
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,760
why have you been acting
smart with that girl?

473
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,840
Can't you just act?

474
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,480
Hey, it's not about that

475
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:34,840
before my accident

476
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,800
before my accident

477
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,800
I had mentioned a girl
who rejected my proposal

478
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,400
is it Julie, daughter
of that auto mechanic?

479
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,400
How do you expect me
to keep a count?

480
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,120
Until you got this new face,

481
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,640
girls who didn't even
propose have rejected you.

482
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,400
Not her---

483
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:48,480
the one which said, she's
doing it for my own good.

484
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,080
the one which said, she's
doing it for my own good.

485
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,520
This director is the same girl

486
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,520
Oh her...

487
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,520
Hey!

488
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,160
It's fair, if you impress
her with your old face

489
00:23:59,160 --> 00:23:59,880
this is cheating.

490
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,480
Did I start this game?

491
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,800
Rejected the face which
she didn't like it

492
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,160
It won't be fair either, if
she gets the face she likes.

493
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,440
Let us toy with her for a while.

494
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,320
Fine, then we'll do the
same with her friend too.

495
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,160
Now you go and pick up the ball.

496
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,520
Hey, can't you see
that we're playing.

497
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,560
Godavari, draw a line damn it

498
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,360
-Hey!
-Ah...!

499
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,320
are we playing Kabbadi here?

500
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:18,720
Don't over do it,
come over here.

501
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,360
Don't over do it,
come over here.

502
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,440
-Fine you keep scoring
-Hey, the ball.

503
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,520
Sir, please Sir.

504
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:26,560
please, please, please---

505
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,560
please, please, please---

506
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,520
Ey...move away from here.

507
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:28,560
Sir...please, please, please.

508
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,720
Sir...please, please, please.

509
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,760
Please Sir!

510
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,480
-Please...!
-Mmmm

511
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,400
I'm saying yes to it, 'cause
you've been literally begging.

512
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,040
But one thing, you
should make a good film.

513
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,560
I'm very particular
about quality.

514
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,120
Understood!?

515
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,600
Sir, you're acting in it.
There's no room for errors.

516
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,600
You made my day.

517
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,640
Thank you, thank you,
thank you...so much.

518
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,440
We'll meet on Saturday, bye.

519
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,280
Hey, come on.

520
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,240
Hey, get lost.

521
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:49,320
He said yes to it.

522
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,760
He said yes to it.

523
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,360
"Don't destroy, Don't destroy"

524
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,880
"Don't destroy the Farmers"

525
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,640
"Don't Kick us Down,
Don't Kick us Down"

526
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,160
"Don't kick the one who sows"

527
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,640
"Don't destroy, Don't destroy"

528
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,440
"Don't destroy the Farmers"

529
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,440
"Don't destroy, Don't destroy"

530
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,360
"Don't destroy the Farmers"

531
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,280
"Don't destroy, Don't destroy"

532
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,960
"Don't destroy the Farmers"

533
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,120
"Don't Kick us Down,
Don't Kick us Down"

rights of the farmers"

536

[SLOGANEERING CONTINUES]

548
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,160
Shakthi!

549
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,000
Ey...!

550
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,680
Ey...Shakthi!

551
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,400
Shakthi!

552
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,880
We're leaving sir,
we're leaving.

553
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,240
Shakthi, look here.

554
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,360
Shakthi!

555
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,080
Shakthi!

556
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,240
Sir, hold on. We're leaving.

557
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,080
"Don't work for the Corporates"

558
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,400
Shakthi!

559
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,320
Sir, please come.

560
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,800
Was the journey comfortable?

561
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,440
Journey really? from
Vadapalani to Valsaravakkam?

562
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,080
And you're inquiring
as if you got us here

563
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,920
has the shooting been canceled?

564
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,920
Sir, why are you being cynical?

565
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,720
The shooting is
happening right here.

566
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:14,800
Here!?

567
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,280
Here!?

568
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,800
I don't think so. I've been
to Shankar Sir's shooting

569
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,320
there will be a big
team working actively.

570
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,120
Sir, if you're ready we
can take the first shot.

571
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,520
-How's it possible?
-Is there no Caravan?

572
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:22,600
Sir!?

573
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,280
Sir!?

574
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,480
-Caravan...Caravan
-There's no Caravan!?

575
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,680
Why there's no Caravan?

576
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,400
Sir, the entire budget of
this film is 20,000 rupees.

577
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,920
from which we've borrowed
5000 on interest.

578
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,600
So caravan would be impossible.

579
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,240
We believe in our script.

580
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,560
To hell with your script---

581
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,280
---my Guru Sunny Leone's movie doesn't
have a script neither dialogues.

582
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,480
all we hear is just ****.

583
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:39,680
that's fine---

584
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,160
that's fine---

585
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,000
---how do I get make-up
done and change costumes.

586
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,240
What if someone records
a video of me?

587
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,120
Who will answer to my family?

588
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,240
That's right, if
they record a video

589
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,240
Surprising Video---

590
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,400
---look at the youngster in it

591
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,440
if you're a Tamizhan speak up

592
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,640
if something like this
happens, how can we take it?

593
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,200
-He's right!
-Sir, no one will record a video

594
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,000
I can guarantee, please
co-operate Sir.

595
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,960
Hey, get a cold drink for Sir.

596
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,080
Sir, please have this.

597
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,480
What's this?

598
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,000
So, is this what you were
calling a cold drink?

599
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,280
Fine, give one for me as well.

600
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,480
Actually we're out of cold drink

601
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:09,560
we just have water packet. Is that fine?

602
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,360
we just have water packet. Is that fine?

603
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,760
Why are wasting that one me---

604
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,840
--just open that ice box

605
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,040
I'll just lick it good.

606
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:15,280
Sharing is caring.

607
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,200
Sharing is caring.

608
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:16,920
Hey!

609
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,480
Fine, give me that

610
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,360
It's been half an hour
since I've asked you

611
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,240
Where can I change?

612
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,760
Sir, what's wrong with you---

613
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,640
our Heroine itself is
changing behind the tree.

614
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:24,680
but you're---

615
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,360
but you're---

616
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,720
---what kind of shameless
heroine is she?

617
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,000
Are you that Heroine?

618
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:43,520
Ya!

619
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,200
I'm yet to accept
you as a director.

620
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,600
And you've already
jumped in as an actor.

621
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,280
Sir, I'm a theater artist

622
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,120
which theater? Is it
Jothi or Sathyam?

623
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,280
Why are your lips bleeding?

624
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,080
This is lipstick not blood.

625
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,560
Why have you bloated
your lips with it?

626
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,120
Lipstick it seems.

627
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,240
I'll tone it down

628
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,920
Shall we run through
the dialogues once?

629
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,720
Green background

630
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,280
I'm sitting alone on the bench

631
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,480
cool breeze

632
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,120
You're walking towards me

633
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,040
with love in your eyes.

634
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,960
You're very beautiful

635
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,680
I really like you

636
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,600
I wish to live a
century with you.

637
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:20,840
I love you!

638
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,880
That's your dialogue.

639
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:22,920
"I Love You"

640
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,200
It's very lame

641
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,640
who proposes like
that these days?

642
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,640
Sir, this happened in my life.

643
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,080
On guy came forward
and asked me.

644
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,440
It's based on a true story.

645
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,320
I don't think he would've
said a century though

646
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,440
Cinema is all about
turning 1 into 100.

647
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,120
Oh...!

648
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,400
She is speaking as if
she invented Cinema.

649
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,120
Sir, isn't this
scene impressive.

650
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,440
Will you take my advice?

651
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:48,520
Thinking out of the
box is the trend now.

652
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,360
Thinking out of the
box is the trend now.

653
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,360
I have an idea, see
if you like it.

654
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,400
A beautiful village,

655
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,320
it's called "Valagapatti"

656
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,480
Camera rolling...!

657
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,240
Action!

658
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,280
Isn't this beautiful?

659
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,120
Have you ever been to a village?

660
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,400
Hello, it was my idea to come
over here before marriage.

661
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,080
Hope you didn't forget
looking at the village.

662
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,320
Get ready once we reach there

663
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,880
Have to meet the Village Officer.

664
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,480
There are few formalities
to sell the house.

665
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,880
Look at that.

666
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,400
We use to stay here before
Dad got transferred.

667
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,880
It's been 18 years since
we left this place.

668
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,400
No matter what happens, I
can't forget this house.

669
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,080
Hey try catching me---

670
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,440
---Shiva don't run,
stop right there.

671
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,880
You won't be able to catch me.

672
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,280
Hey, be careful while
you're playing.

673
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,760
Ey! Enough of playtime,
get back to studies.

674
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,440
I'm just flooded with
memories right now.

675
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,360
How's my house?

676
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,040
Do you like it?

677
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,640
A lot!

678
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,520
Music used to be on audio
cassettes those days

679
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,400
the rewind button doesn't
work on our player

680
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,120
so sister and I use a pencil to
rewind and then listen to them.

681
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,600
Manually tuned radio

682
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,960
when songs on TV gets blurry

683
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,200
getting on terrace
to fix the antenna.

684
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,840
A black phone, used to
dial with a finger.

685
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,160
the next generation will
never come to know of this.

686
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,160
It's not extinct,
but have changed.

687
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,840
iPods, iPhone etc...

688
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,720
...progress baby!

689
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,160
What kind of progress?

690
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,640
Those days were of
grandmother stories and food

691
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,400
Tamizh which wasn't
polluted by English.

692
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,200
birds chirping, where did it all go?

693
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,720
As a result of evolution,
they disappeared.

694
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,920
Wonder what kind of Evolution

695
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,800
when we're suppressing our own
identity, evolution doesn't matter.

696
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,840
Ok Tiger calm down, you win.

697
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:14,640
Come on!

698
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,880
Shiva, let's comeback to
your nostalgia later---

699
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,640
---the village officer might
leave 'cause we're late.

700
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,840
My mom used to come all the
way here to fetch water.

701
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,000
What the hell. She
used to come so far?

702
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,200
That's when pipeline was
introduced to our village

703
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,120
Sir, my name is Kumarasamy.

704
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,360
I'm coming from Valagapatti

705
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,160
heard that our village has been
given the facility of water pipes.

706
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,400
But my house has been
left out on the list.

707
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,040
When I went to the office,

708
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,680
they asked me to meet you
and get a signature.

709
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,240
Fine, make a payment of 5000.

710
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,240
Will get it done.

711
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,160
Sir, I've already
made the payment.

00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,880
Ration card and other
documents has been submitted.

713
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,360
Make a payment of 5000 rupees.

714
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,920
Your house will get a pipeline.

715
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,480
After that my mom used to come
here for long to fetch water.

716
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,800
But, why? If at all
he had paid the money

717
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,200
the house would've got water.

718
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,120
My father is a very stubborn guy.

719
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,280
He lived an honest life
away from bribery.

720
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:27,600
Take this.

721
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,320
-Tell me
-Hello Sir!

722
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,240
My name is Shiva---

723
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,920
---there used to be a Headmaster
in the name of Muthumanickam

724
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,880
I'm his grandson.

725
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,040
Oh...! Are you Kumarasamy's son?

726
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,200
-Yes Sir.
-Sit down.

727
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,800
-Thanks
-Sit down please.

728
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,880
How's your Dad doing these days?

729
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,120
Last year he died due
to heart attack.

730
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,360
-He died?
-Yes.

731
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,160
Oh God, he was
such a good person.

732
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,840
That's right Sir, it came
as a shock to us too.

733
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,880
Sir, it's nothing

734
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,320
we're here to sell
our grandpa's house

735
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,120
My passport, driving
license, everything is inside

736
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,800
I have Dad's old ration card

737
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,560
Proving that I'm
Muthumanickam's grandson

738
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,280
if you issue me a legal
heir, will be helpful Sir.

739
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,320
Sure I will.

740
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,920
-Definitely will give it to you
-Ok Sir.

741
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,440
Ah...if you make a
payment of 10,000

742
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,320
I'll give you the letter.

743
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,320
Sir, why do I have pay 10,000?

744
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,800
My grandfather is from this village,

745
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,440
you've already mentioned that
you knew my father.

746
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,280
I'm not asking something
which isn't here.

747
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,080
This is not something new, Son.

748
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,720
I usually ask for 15,000/-

749
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,080
As you're from here, I
just asked for 10,000.

750
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,840
Pay up and I'll give it.

it will be risky.

any of this to me.

definitely can't be done.

Bank doesn't approve a loan,
'cause you've become responsible.

00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,560
Hello!

887
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,080
-What happened Sir?
-who is that?

888
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,520
Bro what happened?

889
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,840
-He's bleeding
-Who is this?

890
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,760
Sir, tell me who are you?

891
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,280
You're done with it.

892
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,520
Thanks Doctor!

893
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,240
How did you get hurt Shiva?

894
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,040
I rammed into a nail on my way.

895
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,840
Your life was saved by 2 inches.

896
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,320
If the cut had been
a little deeper---

897
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,480
---it would've been very fatal.

898
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,640
I understand Doctor.

899
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,160
-Ah...Hi!
-Shiva!

900
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,560
Sorry to have disturbed
you so late.

901
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,640
No issues, please come in.

902
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,440
I need to talk to you
about something---

903
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,040
---not an issue,
please sit down.

904
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,480
Don't take me wrong---

905
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,360
---how did your son die?

906
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,520
He's not my Son.

907
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,120
In fact, I don't
even know his name.

908
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,160
When I was returning
from a function,

909
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,080
he was lying on the road hurt.

910
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,760
No idea, which vehicle
had ran over him.

911
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,360
No one came forward to help him.

912
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,040
Poor thing, he was lying
on the road helpless.

913
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,720
His head was bleeding.

914
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,400
Ravi, who must've run over him

915
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,560
please open your eyes,
please open your eyes.

916
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,160
What are you staring at?
Lift him up.

917
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,280
It's not that Madam,

918
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,080
we might get tangled in a
case, might create an issue.

919
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,720
What's wrong with you?
He's still breathing.

920
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,600
The hospital is nearby,
we can take him there.

921
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:25,920
Lift him up, we're
just 5 mins away.

922
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,160
We took him in my car,

923
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,920
and got admitted at
the hospital nearby.

924
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,040
He went into coma.

925
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,520
Hoping for him to get better---

926
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,920
---I was expecting
know more about him.

927
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,840
Oh, that case---

928
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,960
---fine, why have you
come all the way for him?

929
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,320
Lodged the complaint,
finished with formalities

930
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,640
and get back to your work.

931
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,640
Sir, that man is
struggling for his life.

932
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,160
Still we don't know who is he---

933
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,240
---identity is unknown.

934
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,240
Firstly who are you?

935
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,680
Why should I answer to you?

936
00:44:58,840 --> 00:44:59,960
Social Worker!

937
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,480
Name is Gowri Thiruselvan.

938
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:02,760
Oh...!

939
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,040
So what, if you're
a Social worker

940
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,080
who is serving you at home?

941
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,120
You must have help
for that, right?

942
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,120
Don't think I'll let this go, if
you attack on personal matters.

943
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,400
Ours is this thick skin of NGO,

944
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,600
ego is pointless,
and we fear no one.

945
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,400
Then, we'll have to take
action on a different level.

946
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,360
What will you do?

947
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,040
Will you publish
it in THE HINDU?

948
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,000
Please go ahead.

949
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,720
Sir, I think you're unaware

950
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,160
according to Right to Information Act.

951
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,440
If we file a petition at Governors
office, he has to answer.

952
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,840
What action have you taken
pertaining to this boy's case?

953
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:36,000
Have you sent an email or a fax?

954
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,480
If you don't give an explanation
on why you haven't found anything

955
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,000
we can take legal
action against you.

956
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,280
Do whatever you can

957
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,120
it's a country with a
population of 100 crores.

958
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,200
Where will I look?

959
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,760
Shall we try magic?

960
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:48,880
Ah!?

961
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,920
If I come to know about
anything, will call you.

962
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
You can leave now.

963
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:57,480
In order to save a life,
I didn't think twice

964
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,760
I put my signature
on that register.

965
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,000
Doctor had mentioned
about your accident.

966
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,160
In a Govt. Hospital's mortuary

967
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,320
better than getting
cremated as an orphan

968
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,360
thought it will be
beneficial to you.

969
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,680
I pretended to be his mother.

970
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,400
thought about it and
signed once again.

971
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:15,840
Why? What happened?

972
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,440
Mistaking me for him---

973
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,040
---they're trying to kill me.

974
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,880
Looking at all of it, I don't
think it was an accident

975
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,800
but a murder.

976
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:30,880
Murder uh!?

977
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,280
I was just thinking of
giving you a face---

978
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,800
but that face will bring
you so many issues

979
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,280
never expected it.

980
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:40,800
I'm---

981
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,480
---what do you want me to do?

982
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,800
Look here, it's not your fault

983
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:48,600
If you come to know anything about
it, you have my phone number

984
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:49,720
please keep me informed.

985
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:50,920
Definitely, Sure!

986
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,480
I don't know what to say...!

987
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,520
Please be careful.

988
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:58,880
-Tell me Mom
-Shiva...!

989
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,440
It's really late, why
haven't you come home yet?

990
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,000
I'm coming home

991
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,600
do you want Dosa or
Chapathi for dinner?

992
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:05,560
I'll come and tell you.

993
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:07,040
I---

994
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:11,360
Hello!

995
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:13,320
Shiva!?

996
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,720
How long will it take
for you to get home?

997
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:21,640
I'll let you know, Mom.

998
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:40,480
These days even to buy a helmet
they do extreme research

999
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,960
but you're struggling here
with a stranger's face.

1000
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,680
You could've rather remained
with your burnt face.

1001
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:46,760
Don't know who is he?

1002
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,520
No idea, why they're chasing me.

1003
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,200
I'm worried about
Mom and Sister.

1004
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,560
I'm not returning home,
until this is sorted.

1005
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:55,560
Hey...!

1006
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,040
You're here now---

1007
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,920
---what if they assume this
is your house and kill me?

1008
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,040
You're selfish---

1009
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:05,400
---you want your family safe, but
doesn't matter if I get lynched.

1010
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,560
Hey don't drink, you're
going to get a headache

1011
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,880
not sure I'm going to
have my head anymore.

1012
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:13,760
Headache it seems.

1013
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:14,840
-Ey!
-Ah!

1014
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,080
When we were at IOC---

1015
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,560
---there was a girl
who recognized me

1016
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:17,640
Ya the voluptuous one.

1017
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:18,520
Ya the voluptuous one.

1018
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,320
If we ask her, she might
know something about him.

1019
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,240
That's a great idea.

1020
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,760
-What are you eating?
-Bubble Gum!

1021
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:26,400
Here!

1022
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:27,640
Ey!

1023
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:29,200
Let that go

1024
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,360
When was the last
time you met him?

1025
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,720
The other day in the elevator.

1026
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:33,680
Before that!?

1027
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,160
This you can ask him yourself.

1028
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,400
Few chapters are
lost at the moment.

1029
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,400
He lost his memory due to a
head injury from an accident.

1030
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:42,240
Oh my God!

1031
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,520
He has written your last meet
on is thigh to remember.

1032
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:45,600
Do you want to see it?

1033
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:46,200
No, no, no, no!

1034
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:46,960
It's just on the thigh

1035
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,440
I actually met him once---

1036
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:52,280
---on a train from
Trichy to Chennai.

1037
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,240
While I was talking to him

1038
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,440
he mentioned his name as Shakthi

1039
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,160
and his hometown is near Trichy.

1040
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,520
I don't know anything
else about him.

1041
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:01,600
Actually this is enough

1042
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:03,520
I'll use this information
to jog his memory.

1043
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:04,840
Thanks a lot.

1044
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:06,000
Ok, bye. Thank you.

1045
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,160
-Hello!
-Ma, this is Shiva speaking

1046
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,720
Hey Shiva! why didn't you
come home last night?

1047
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:13,600
where were you?

1048
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,480
Mom, you first listen to me
and stop asking questions.

1049
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,280
I'm heading to Trichy for an
emergency pertaining to work

1050
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,960
You send across my clothes and
medical reports through Geetha.

1051
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:21,720
I'll return and
explain everything.

1052
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:22,400
For what!?

1053
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,320
Mom, please listen to what I have to say.
I'll explain it later.

1054
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:25,720
-Bye!
-Shiva!

1055
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,360
Hey you!
Shiva inside of Shakti!

1056
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,480
We just have a name---

1057
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:40,400
---with just that how do expect us to
find someone in a big city like Trichy.

1058
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,760
Are you going to
sing a family song?

1059
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,000
Even if you do, no idea
if there's a family song.

1060
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,040
Get inside...

1061
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:45,480
Ya...Ya, 24!

1062
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:47,000
Ya...Ya, 24!

1063
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:52,760
-Hey!
-Ah...

1064
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:53,920
We didn't have anything---

1065
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:53,960
---at least we his name
and the city he lived in.

1066
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,360
---at least we his name
and the city he lived in.

1067
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:57,840
When we get down in that city

1068
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,960
someone who knows Shakthi
will come and speak to us.

1069
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,320
It's fine, if they
just come and talk

1070
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,800
just like how Vijay gets
shot in "Kaththi" movie

1071
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,480
what if you get shot like that?

1072
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:05,520
You're right

1073
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,440
people came Chennai to kill me

1074
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,040
don't you think, he'll
send someone to Trichy?

1075
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,800
We'll catch hold
of one from them,

1076
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,320
and say that I'm not the
one they're looking for.

1077
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,680
face transplant, accident
we'll make them understand.

1078
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:15,760
Our issue will be resolved.

1079
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,480
You're being too ambitious.

1080
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:19,560
I'm not taking this risk

1081
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,480
Train is running at full speed.

1082
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:23,440
-Jump off it
-Ey...!

1083
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,240
Fine, either ways I'm
going to be killed.

1084
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,320
Hey, who are you?

1085
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,520
Girls are around, don't you
feel ashamed being half naked?

1086
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,320
Where are you headed?

1087
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,720
I'm heading to write NEET exam.

1088
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:33,800
Then he's dressed right.

1089
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:35,240
Then he's dressed right.

1090
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:36,960
Hey, then why are you
just wearing shorts?

1091
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,600
They'll strip him off it,
once he's reaches there.

1092
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,400
-Where are you going to write?
-Trivandrum!

1093
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:41,680
Why, isn't there a
place in our state?

1094
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:42,680
There's no vacancy in Tamilnadu.

1095
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,240
They have vacant places
to open liquor shops,

1096
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,360
but there's no place
to write exams.

1097
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,880
Hello, this time I'll
definitely clear the exam.

1098
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:49,680
All the best!

1099
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:54,000
Hey Shiva! what a surprise.

1100
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:54,640
-Hey, Hi.
-Hi!

1101
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:56,160
I've been trying to
contact you for a week

1102
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:57,640
It kept saying not reachable

1103
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:00,440
You know what, our short film
has reached 7 million views.

1104
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,280
That's great, congratulations!

1105
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,120
"Athadi Enna Udambi"
[Trending Tamil Song]

1106
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,720
"Anga Anga Pachai Nirmabi"
[Trending Tamil Song]

1107
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,120
Even this song has reached
10 million views.

1108
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:06,760
So what!?

1109
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,120
I've got a chance
to direct a film.

1110
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:08,960
-Oh!
-You please sit down.

1111
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:10,920
Greetings one and all!

1112
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,480
-Greetings brother!
-Ya, Hello!

1113
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:13,800
Do you know who is he?

1114
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,520
Are you this Train's
engine mechanic?

1115
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:16,680
Sir is our producer.

1116
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:17,640
He's from Thuraiooru.

1117
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:18,480
We're heading there
for location hunt.

1118
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,280
That's right!

1119
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:19,720
Sir, this is Shiva.

1120
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:20,880
Sir, this is Shiva.

1121
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:21,480
Glad to meet you---

1122
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:22,560
He's the one, who changed
the course of my life.

1123
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,000
It's 'cause of him,
I'm a director now.

1124
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
I agreed to produce, 'cause
the Hero referred her.

1125
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,320
But she's been ranting about
Linear - Nonlinear

1126
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,800
I don't understand anything.

1127
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,120
I'm worried if I
can make profit.

1128
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:36,520
Revolutionary Leader MGR's

1129
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,720
movie "Anbe Vaa", I've
seen it 50 times.

1130
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:41,800
I can narrate that
story in my sleep.

1131
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,120
This is his problem

1132
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:44,720
he's still stuck in 1970's

1133
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,360
Cinema has advanced
a lot since then

1134
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,920
Sir, please mix with the trend

1135
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:48,600
I'll come

1136
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:51,600
Showcase your trend in
the Climax I suggested.

1137
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,040
Brother, you tell me one thing

1138
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,440
how should be a climax?

1139
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,720
A Hero should fight
leaping like a tiger,

1140
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,280
and kill the villain. That's
when audience will applaud.

1141
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,960
Isn't that the
successful formula?

1142
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,080
Only then, we can make money.

1143
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:03,360
You're speaking like an "M"

1144
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,720
-Ey...!
-I meant you're Magnificent

1145
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:05,680
Exactly...!

1146
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,720
Sir, no matter how strong you're

1147
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,960
you can't kill someone
with your bare hands.

1148
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,800
What are the chances?

1149
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:13,880
Shiva, but I've read in a novel

1150
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,280
this is my film's climax.

1151
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,880
If Epidefrine is induced into
someone's body in abundance

1152
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,520
will die of excess adrenaline.

1153
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:23,280
Not only that, traces of it won't
be captured in Post-Mortem report.

1154
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,840
It's available at the Hospital
to keep the patients stable.

1155
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,200
And if adrenaline is
injected in excess,

1156
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:29,280
they'll definitely die.

1157
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:30,360
100%

1158
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:31,320
I might die too.

1159
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,800
These things should be cinematic

1160
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,720
Sir you can decide after
watching the entire film.

1161
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,680
I don't I'll be in a state to
talk after watching the film.

1162
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,520
She gets easily angry

1163
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:41,520
what can I do here?

1164
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,120
Hey!

1165
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,920
you mentioned about explaining things
to the people who are chasing

1166
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:46,960
do you think, they'll
understand Face Transplant?

1167
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,280
Let's check with
this B & C audience

1168
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,160
-Sir!
-Huh!?

1169
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,760
I have this friend

1170
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,680
he used to look exactly
like you, ugly---

1171
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:54,640
-is it so?
-Ya!

1172
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,440
6 moths ago in a fire accident

1173
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,600
his face got fully burnt

1174
00:56:58,600 --> 00:56:59,080
Oh no!

1175
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,120
So they did Face Transplant,

1176
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:01,960
what did you say?

1177
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:03,680
Face Transport uh!?

1178
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,320
It's not transport,
it's face transplant.

1179
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:09,520
His face was changed
with a surgery,

1180
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:12,080
now he looks exactly like
Ultimate Star Ajith.

1181
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:12,880
-Ey...!
-Ah...

1182
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:14,320
Are you blind?

1183
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,800
Have you not seen
Thala Ajith before?

1184
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:17,480
-Brother
-Ah...

1185
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,600
Do you peck me for a crack
head on this train?

1186
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:20,880
-Idiot!
-Ah!

1187
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,960
You seem to be a genius

1188
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:25,200
are you aware of short
term memory loss?

1189
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:25,840
Yes I do.

1190
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:26,760
How do you know that?

1191
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,280
Wasn't that explained
in the movie Ghajini.

1192
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,680
But there's no move
pertaining to this

1193
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:30,960
then how do you expect
me to believe this?

1194
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:32,880
That's right, you're great.

1195
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,400
Even if we look for the
ones who are chasing us,

1196
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,360
I doubt they'll understand
what we have to say.

1197
00:57:58,440 --> 00:57:59,680
What happened?

1198
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:02,120
Nothing!

1199
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:02,760
Just like that.

1200
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,120
The thing I asked on the
day I won the competition,

1201
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:07,440
was inquiring about that.

1202
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,600
I should get the feeling of
living with you for a century

1203
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:18,720
I need to have that trust

1204
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,880
When I look at your
face, that trust---

1205
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:23,520
---isn't evident.

1206
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,080
I might marry you

1207
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,240
but when we go out in the public

1208
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,520
and when the people look at us

1209
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,040
The boy is handsome

1210
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,360
but the girl is not
that good looking.

1211
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:34,760
I'll feel bad about it.

1212
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:36,200
So, let's not.

1213
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:38,800
It's for your own good.

1214
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:47,400
I'm not angry for
what you've said.

1215
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,440
I said the exact
thing to one person.

1216
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,280
Now I get it, how hurt
he would've been.

1217
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:58,400
I'll definitely apologize to
him, If I meet him someday.

1218
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:01,200
If so, you'll have
to apologize to me.

1219
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:16,880
That's me.

1220
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:24,920
His name is Shakthi.

1221
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:28,600
They've been chasing
me thinking I'm Shiva.

1222
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:31,840
I'm heading for Trichy
to find out who is he.

1223
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:37,080
Doctored Kiss, is it?

1224
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:38,640
Hey!

1225
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,160
Just hold on for a
minute, I'll return him.

1226
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:44,080
Buddy

1227
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,440
do you even realize
why are we here?

1228
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,640
I'm not able to sleep.

1229
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:52,840
I'm pissing in fear, that someone
might hack me into pieces.

1230
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:55,040
I'm not even related
to this issue.

1231
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:56,200
But you---

1232
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,960

they made them chuck
us out of the work

1408
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:59,160
kept saying "Our Company",
damn with their company.

1409
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:01,600
I'm scared thinking about
the payment due next month

1410
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:04,400
Hey, I'm due 95,000
on my credit card

1411
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:05,800
everyone has issues.

1412
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:08,800
My friend is working as a
Team Leader at Hexagon

1413
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:10,440
shall I approach him for the job?

1414
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:12,000
Not required

1415
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:15,480
How long are we going to be enslaved
to these foreign companies?

1416
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:18,680
Were we born to do this?

1417
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:20,160
What else can we do?

1418
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:23,160
We're not in this
IT job accidentally

1419
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:24,960
we've graduated in
B.E.Computer Science.

1420
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,800
What else do we know
other than coding?

1421
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:28,560
Is that all we know?

1422
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:29,360
Think hard

1423
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:31,320
Hey, we're not in a
situation to think

1424
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:32,520
they've fired us

1425
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:34,680
we have worked for a year
in that Agro Tech project

1426
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:37,040
I can only think of Netherlands
agriculture, even in my sleep

1427
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:38,680
we have this knowledge right?

1428
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:40,520
About Netherlands agriculture?

1429
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:42,120
Why are we still stuck
up on Netherlands?

1430
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:44,800
We'll think of aspects to improve
agriculture on our lands.

1431
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,040
What are you saying?

1432
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:48,360
I have 5 acres of
land in my village,

1433
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:51,320
I've decided

1434
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:53,440
I'm going to do agriculture

1435
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:54,920
We'll start it now, Maya

1436
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:58,560
Just by inking your fingers once
in 5 years, won't bring a change.

1437
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:01,880
We'll have to get down in
the arena and work for it.

1438
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:04,160
You're right, and
it's good to hear

1439
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:07,440
instead of working without
a clue for a foreign land

1440
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:09,680
we can be rightful
owners to our own land.

1441
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:47,840
How long will you
be hogging the pump

1442
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:50,280
I have a infant waiting at home

1443
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:52,760
I just need two pots of water

1444
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:54,600
let me take it, let me

1445
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:57,320
Hey...Panchali

1446
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:58,400
get that pot here

1447
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:00,280
get that pot here damn it.

1448
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:02,840
Be careful, don't spill it.

1449
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:03,560
Here, take this too.

1450
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:05,840
We've been waiting
in hot sun for long,

1451
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:08,320
how is it fair to
jump the queue?

1452
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:08,440
don't we seem humans to you

1453
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:10,240
don't we seem humans to you

1454
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:12,680
Hey, I'm talking to you
get back in the line.

1455
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:17,560
-Hey Shakthi
-Fatso!

1456
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:19,160
-Hey Shakthi
-Fatso!

1457
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:20,400
-Brother!
-Maya Ma!

1458
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:21,800
How are you!?

1459
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:24,680
So you're the fat
brother from village

1460
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:25,800
you're chubby and cute.

1461
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:27,520
Shakthi dear---

1462
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,240
---fat boy

1463
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:30,240
Are you fine Son?

1464
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:31,360
Mom, these are my friends

1465
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:32,360
-Come in Son.
-Hello Aunty.

1466
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:33,880
We both started the job together

1467
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:34,920
and have been fired
together as well.

1468
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:37,000
Oh no, even you got fired?

1469
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:38,120
That's right.

1470
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:41,800
Mom, did you tell Dad?

1471
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:43,400
I'm scared to tell him.

1472
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:46,120
You tell him yourself
when he's in a good mood.

1473
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,280
If I say anything
he'll shout at me.

1474
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:51,680
Son, how many days are
you on leave this time?

1475
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:53,000
Dad, about that---

1476
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,600
---at least this time
try staying for long.

1477
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:55,600
Not just few days Uncle,

1478
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:56,640
we're going to stay
here for good.

1479
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:57,760
Just show tell me
which is my room---

1480
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:58,560
This is my friend Shanmugam.

1481
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:00,480
-Hello uncle.
-This is Shakthi's brother Dong Lee.

1482
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:00,520
Hi!

1483
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:01,360
Hi!

1484
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:04,440
We're not leave, but
have quit our jobs.

1485
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:07,280
They didn't quit,
they got fired.

1486
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:09,520
-Fatso, take this inside.
-Let that go.

1487
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:12,640
It's become routine
with the IT companies

1488
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,960
650 were sacked in Verizon

1489
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:16,920
you have a 3 years experience

1490
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:18,520
you can find a job elsewhere.

1491
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:22,120
I'm not going to
look for a job, Dad.

1492
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,520
I'm going to do agriculture

1493
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:25,880
have you gone nuts?

1494
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:27,480
I worked hard for your studies,

1495
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:29,440
and you want to
return to sludge

1496
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,520
this is just not
sludge but a tunnel

1497
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:35,240
When I was working in IT, I found
out suitable methods for irrigation

1498
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:37,080
with extensive research and
have developed an App.

1499
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:38,840
Instead of doing that
for a foreign country,

1500
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:40,560
why shouldn't I do
it for our village?

1501
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:42,480
Basically agriculture is
the back bone of India.

1502
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:44,720
70% of the population is
involved in agriculture.

1503
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:44,760
You've read about Verizon,

1504
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,000
You've read about Verizon,

1505
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:46,840
but unaware of this.

1506
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:47,960
I'm disappointed.

1507
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:49,480
Ey...you guys have gone crazy.

1508
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:51,720
We need water for agriculture.

1509
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:55,560
Which isn't available, that's why I've sold
my land and planning to settle in Chennai.

1510
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:57,080
Who said there's water
available in Chennai?

1511
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:57,840
-Eh!?
-Useless buggers

1512
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:01,200
Councilor has mentioned that our
land will fetch us good price

1513
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:04,040
he has given 1 lac as
advance yesterday.

1514
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:05,800
Start looking for a job
in another company,

1515
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:07,840
Brother get me my bag,

1516
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:09,440
-Stay back son,
-I don't want a room

1517
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:09,520
We'll go elsewhere
and do agriculture

1518
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,000
We'll go elsewhere
and do agriculture

1519
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:11,960
At least give me that coffee.

1520
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:33,520
Is this the Councilor's house?

1521
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:35,560
Damn, it's so huge

1522
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:38,080
Even Pondicherry CM's
house won't be this big.

1523
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:40,320
I think he must've been
to Kovathur as well.

1524
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:43,440
Get inside stuff yourself with meat
balls and inquire about the place

1525
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:44,560
Ah..tell me brother.

1526
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:45,360
Hello Sir!

1527
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:46,640
Come in, brother.

1528
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:47,960
Did Dad send you?

1529
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:48,120
I just had a word with the astrologer
for a good date to register.

1530
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:50,200
I just had a word with the astrologer
for a good date to register.

1531
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:52,400
Day after is Ashtami and Navami

1532
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:53,560
so he suggested to
do it tomorrow.

1533
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:56,360
Ah Sir...I'm here to
talk to you about it.

1534
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:58,560
As of now, we don't have the
idea of selling the land.

1535
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:02,120
that's why I came down to return the
advance and inform not to register.

1536
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:03,480
Brother---

1537
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:06,760
---your land is going to
be used in a huge project.

1538
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:07,800
So---

1539
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:09,720
---the payment
will be a big one.

1540
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:12,400
Ah...no Sir. We don't wish
to sell it at the moment.

1541
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:13,480
We've changed our minds.

1542
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:17,120
Get those tablets for
Blood pressure damn it.

1543
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:18,760
Get lost!

1544
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:24,160
Are you trying to threaten me with
this person and hike the price?

1545
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:25,560
It's not like that

1546
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:27,320
Sir have a good look at me

1547
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:29,920
Do you seriously
feel threatened?

1548
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:32,720
Days are gone for a
villain to look dreadful

1549
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:35,600
wearing glasses and doing
villainous stuff is the trend now

1550
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:36,440
Damn funny, Sir.

1551
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,480
I'm damn serious about it.

1552
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:41,880
Your father is,
Head of the Village.

1553
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:45,680
if he returns the money,
he'll set a bad example

1554
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:48,240
then everyone in the village
will start to do the same.

1555
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:49,600
What can we do about it?

1556
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:51,680
We don't wish to sell it now.

1557
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:53,120
Just take back your advance.

1558
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:57,960
What the hell are you going
to do with that land?

1559
01:14:58,120 --> 01:14:59,440
That we'll take care of it.

1560
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:00,600
Sir!

1561
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:02,040
Thank you Sir!

1562
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:04,880
Sir I have a doubt

1563
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:08,120
are those award given to
you for good work done?

1564
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:08,680
Get lost!

1565
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:21,160
Look here Shakthi

1566
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:22,360
just 'cause you're my son

1567
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:24,240
we can't decide
anything in haste

1568
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:27,480
village people's decision will be
the final verdict of Panchayat.

1569
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:29,200
Right, that will be fair.

1570
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:30,280
What is it now?

1571
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:31,320
Listen---

1572
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:32,880
for past 2-3 generations

1573
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:34,440
agriculture is missing
from our village

1574
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:35,840
agriculture which is
depleting at present

1575
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:37,280
we have to give a life to it

1576
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:39,840
Has he gone crazy!?

1577
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:41,200
There's no water
to use in toilets

1578
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:42,520
and he's talking
about agriculture

1579
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:44,400
Just 'cause we don't believe in doing
it, our village is in this state.

1580
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:46,760
So water is the issue here?

1581
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:50,480
The Kalyani river is
gone dry for years

1582
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:53,320
we don't have water
even for basic needs

1583
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:57,080
But the Poongoodi river 20kms off
the village, during heavy rains

1584
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:59,920
the excess water overflows
without being used

1585
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:03,440
My plan is to divert that
water towards our village.

1586
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:06,400
I don't think their idea
will be a practical one.

1587
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,560
You don't think so right?
How will you?

1588
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:11,920
In the last 25 years, has anyone
earned profits doing agriculture?

1589
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:14,440
Have you bought a house? May be
have sold your house instead

1590
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:16,120
At the same time, a
Real Estate owner

1591
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:17,000
sand contractor

1592
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,480
and Bar owner has
been making profits

1593
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:20,200
But farmers have been
committing suicides

1594
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:22,400
Person who have
swindled in crores

1595
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:23,960
evades to a foreign country

1596
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,760
But a loan of 6000
taken for a pump set,

1597
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:26,680
will be beaten up by Police.

1598
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:28,000
It's not that we
can't change this

1599
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,880
but if they change, where
else they will swindle from

1600
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:32,320
They will go to an extent, letting
the corporate get into agriculture

1601
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,400
'Cause he funds the
expenses for Elections.

1602
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,720
They won't think of
changing anything

1603
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:37,960
but we can change
if we decide to.

1604
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,240
that's what our
plan is all about.

1605
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:41,000
We'll give you a
presentation now

1606
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,200
This is Poongoodi river

1607
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:45,480
after enough usage
of that village

1608
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:47,800
the rest of the water just
flows in vain into the sea.

1609
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:49,920
In the path of that river---

1610
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,640
---that is, if we dig
a channel for 20 kms

1611
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:55,000
the water from that river

1612
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,520
is linked to our
village Kalyani river

1613
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:59,720
the pond and wells
will be filled

1614
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:02,520
and we can use that water for
our village's agriculture.

1615
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:05,640
post which excess water will flow
into the sea through Kalyani River.

1616
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:41,760
There are 134 crores
consumers in our country

1617
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:43,920
In spite of it, one
business which runs on loss

1618
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:45,000
is Agriculture.

1619
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:48,480
Everywhere there's a
scarcity of water

1620
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:51,800
to overcome the scarcity, first we
should start linking rivers in India.

1621
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:53,360
This is our plan.

1622
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:54,840
If we achieve this

1623
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:56,480
our village agriculture won't
be dependent on rains.

1624
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:58,920
It will rather be
dependent on our hard work

1625
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:00,800
and the water which will
run along the year.

1626
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:02,280
This scheme seems
to be a good one.

1627
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:04,080
If we ask our MLA,
he'll do it himself.

1628
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:05,320
As if he'll be willing to.

1629
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:06,640
It's been 50 years,

1630
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:09,880
your MLA and others who we elected
could've resolved the cauvery issue

1631
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:12,160
Your MLA, do you know
what his business?

1632
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:13,080
He contracts Sand.

1633
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:14,840
If our rivers start flowing,

1634
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:16,960
and if we start irrigation,
how will he get to sell sand?

1635
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:17,680
Hey...!

1636
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,240
If you trust these youngsters---

1637
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:23,080
---they'll get you
stranded with nothing.

1638
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:26,560
They're a generation of
live-in relationships.

1639
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:29,240
If you listen to their
ideas and follow them---

1640
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:30,840
---you'll regret forever.

1641
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:33,840
Instead sell it all to me

1642
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:36,000
and be happy with the money
it will fetch you guys.

1643
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:36,840
Oh God!

1644
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:41,360
Son, it was 40 years ago

1645
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:43,880
that's how I saw our
village from your eyes.

1646
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:45,920
Before I die,

1647
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:47,760
please change the
fate of this village.

1648
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:52,800
Take this---

1649
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:55,360
---this is what I can offer

1650
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:57,360
My dear!

1651
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:07,640
It's a good project

1652
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:11,320
it's a good thing that youngsters like
you coming forward for agriculture.

1653
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:12,360
Thank you so much Sir.

1654
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:14,520
You're the first person,
who has spoken with hope.

1655
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:15,920
Whoever we went to,

1656
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:17,680
instead of checking what
the project is about

1657
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:19,080
they're keen on how to
reject the proposal.

1658
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:19,240
It's useless in trying
to change them.

1659
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:21,000
It's useless in trying
to change them.

1660
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:22,760
But you three,

1661
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:24,840
don't let your confidence down.

1662
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:28,400
Just make sure to check,
what exactly they need.

1663
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:30,360
What else, they're
expecting money

1664
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:32,000
but they're not asking for it.

1665
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,720
They won't ask you

1666
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:36,120
It's you, who has got the need

1667
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:37,560
you will have to

1668
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:40,280
find out from them, what
they actually expect.

1669
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:41,040
Then why the hell---

1670
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:42,920
-Ey...!
-are they getting paid?

1671
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:43,720
Listen---

1672
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:45,160
---I don't belong
to that category

1673
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:46,880
Look here---

1674
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,240
Tamilnadu Water and Drainage

1675
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:50,800
TWAD

1676
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,560
If they give an approval

1677
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:56,080
I can help as much as I
can within my limits.

1678
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:56,840
Thanks Sir.

1679
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,840
Listen, I've done
as much as I can

1680
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,000
this is such an old bike

1681
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,200
be thankful it's running.

1682
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:01,640
Old really...!

1683
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:03,280
A 60 year old can get married---

1684
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:04,760
---but shouldn't wish
to have a child.

1685
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:06,120
Since the inception
of Aadhar card,

1686
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:08,160
not just the age, even the
personal matters are public

1687
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:08,920
-Sir
-sir!

1688
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:10,520
-who's that?
-My name is Shakthi

1689
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:11,840
I came to you
regarding a petition

1690
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,440
you guys use to come
to office and trouble

1691
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:14,080
now you're here too

1692
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:15,320
We were told you're
never in the office,

1693
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:15,920
who said that?

1694
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:17,200
I meant you will be
busy at the office,

1695
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:18,880
if we meet you outside, we can
have a better conversation.

1696
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:19,360
What's the issue?

1697
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:21,840
Linking the rivers in Poongoodi village,

1698
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:22,640
It's us who are seeking it.

1699
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:25,240
Do you think linking
rivers is a Childs play?

1700
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:26,560
Don't be kidding.

1701
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:28,920
Sir, I don't understand, I don't
see it that how this is funny

1702
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,520
If the next generation is
going to die due to scarcity

1703
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:31,960
we will be stained
with that sin.

1704
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,640
In order to stop such mishap
we're struggling here.

1705
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:35,320
-What is this?
-Car!

1706
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:37,000
-Is it new?
-No it's old

1707
01:20:37,480 --> 01:20:38,880
Was it on EMI or paid in full?

1708
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:39,520
EMI!

1709
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:40,200
Oh-Oh!

1710
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:42,920
Sir, if you give us that
NOC, we can start our work

1711
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:46,120
We don't buy things on EMI,

1712
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:48,080
as we're Govt. servants,
the payments reach home

1713
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:49,200
Why would you take that effort.

1714
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:51,800
You will ignore even if someone
commits a suicide due to loans

1715
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:53,640
what's the mileage?

1716
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:55,840
Sir, you're not listening
to what I'm saying

1717
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:56,840
what happened to that NOC?

1718
01:20:56,840 --> 01:20:58,480
Listen, what you're seeking
is not a small thing,

1719
01:20:58,480 --> 01:20:59,920
there are many formalities

1720
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:01,080
Please understand.

1721
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:02,040
Is the bike ready?

1722
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:04,320
That officer had mentioned,
they won't ask for it directly.

1723
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:06,080
You did see what
he was expecting

1724
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:20,040
♪ Make a living working hard

1725
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:22,920
♪ don't live on hard workers.

1726
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:26,600
Is this is a joke?

1727
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:28,840
Sir, this is not a joke

1728
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:31,680
10 TMC of water from Poongoodi
river mixing into the sea,

1729
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:33,200
if that is diverted
to Kalyani river.

1730
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:35,560
1000 families will make a
living doing agriculture

1731
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:37,320
why are you so concerned
about their lives

1732
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:40,040
Why are we officers and
politician here for?

1733
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:41,920
The entire village knows
why you haven't done it.

1734
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:43,480
We don't want to waste
our time on that

1735
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:45,200
We will work for our needs

1736
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:45,960
Ya right

1737
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:48,720
You guys are fooling yourselves
with digging tunnels and channels

1738
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:50,320
also dragging the
village down with it.

1739
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:51,480
We're not the ones who
are dragging them down

1740
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:52,800
we're not politicians
to do that.

1741
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,320
Our village requires
water for irrigation

1742
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:57,040
we can make that
happen ourselves

1743
01:21:57,160 --> 01:21:58,120
please help us with it.

1744
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:00,200
Agriculture, Cows and Dung---

1745
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:01,480
---it's disgusting to ears.

1746
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:03,560
I hail from a farmer's family

1747
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:05,320
these are useless sentiments

1748
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:06,520
and is a waste of time.

1749
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:09,080
My grandmother took
a promise from me,

1750
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:10,880
asked me never to
comeback to agriculture

1751
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:11,800
'cause I'll be destroyed

1752
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:13,440
If someone talks ill
about agriculture

1753
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:15,560
punch them on their face. That's the
promise my grandmother took from me.

1754
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:17,040
Isn't this pissing you off?

1755
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:18,240
Hey, shut up.

1756
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:19,680
Ey...we're here to
seek permission---

1757
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:21,480
---and he's talking about
his dead grandmother.

1758
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:23,040
Sir, please Sir.

1759
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:24,360
When someone is dying of hunger,

1760
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:26,400
it's a torture to their sight
when you throw away the food.

1761
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:27,920
For God sake don't do that.

1762
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,160
1000 families can make a living.

1763
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:33,240
And we're ready to invest
our money and work for it.

1764
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:35,000
Can you just grant us
permission to do it.

1765
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:37,960
no matter what you say, I can't
permit public to work on their own

1766
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:39,640
If you want, file a petition

1767
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:42,120
if everything is right, Govt.
will act on it.

1768
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:43,920
There's a procedure for everything.

1769
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:45,920
Are you really following the procedure? And
giving a permit to the bars at wine shop.

1770
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:46,960
You've permitted
it, taking bribes.

1771
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:48,960
We're trying something good
here, and you demand bribe

1772
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:49,760
don't call yourself an officer.

1773
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:50,480
Mind your words

1774
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:52,200
I'm talking to you damn
it, and it's the truth

1775
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:54,520
Sir, can you or not?

1776
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:55,440
Just tell us that

1777
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:56,640
don't talk nonsense.

1778
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:58,080
Didn't I ask you to
file a petition.

1779
01:22:58,120 --> 01:22:58,720
We'll take care of it.

1780
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:00,600
Sure will take care of it.

1781
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:02,000
-Sure!
-Sure!

1782
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:03,720
This won't work out

1783
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:05,080
They don't seem like rules

1784
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:06,960
they're mongrels in
the name of officers

1785
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:09,320
Salary and Bonus, if they don't
get it, they go on a strike

1786
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:10,880
on top of it they need bribe

1787
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:11,360
Damn it!

1788
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:13,720
Losing is not something
new to our village

1789
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:16,400
that doesn't mean we accept
defeat and lose hope.

1790
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:18,840
Hey...why are you
getting angry at me?

1791
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:20,800
They won't permit, even
after they're dead.

1792
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:22,800
We will get it, I
will make it happen.

1793
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:27,240
Hey, come here.

1794
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:28,720
-Us?
-Yes you guys,

1795
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:29,360
come here.

1796
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:42,480
It's them Sir.

1797
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:45,720
Hey, Rajan.

1798
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:48,320
-Do you know one thing
-Sir!

1799
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:52,080
These guys were working in
a IT company at Chennai

1800
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:54,600
They were fired from that job.

1801
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:56,400
while they were wondering
what to do for living?

1802
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:59,600
they thought of these
foolish village people.

1803
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,480
This agriculture, water,
protests, hay etc---

1804
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:05,440
---got he public confused

1805
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:07,520
then swindle their funds

1806
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:10,520
and evade to foreign countries
like America and Australia.

1807
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:13,440
Isn't this your perfect plan?

1808
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:15,200
Buddy do you know one thing

1809
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:16,760
Poongoodi water service

1810
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:17,480
Sir owns it

1811
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,400
there are 62 water tankers

1812
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:20,920
if the village gets
access to good water

1813
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:22,280
Sir's water can business

1814
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:23,880
will go down the drain.

1815
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:29,520
Isn't this your
perfect plan, Sir?

1816
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:31,000
62 trucks is it?

1817
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:32,200
You're an inspector, right?

1818
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:34,480
You must earn around 50-60k?

1819
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:36,640
Even we get paid the
same in IT companies

1820
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:38,280
No matter how much we slog---

1821
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:40,480
---we have multiple EMI's
taken from our accounts

1822
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:42,560
how is that you have
62 trucks running?

1823
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:44,520
How many families you
must've destroyed.

1824
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:49,760
Ey...how dare you!

1825
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:51,160
Sir, Sir...don't hit me.

1826
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:52,160
Sir don't

1827
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:52,760
Damn you!

1828
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:54,360
Ey...Sir!

1829
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:56,160
Sir, don't hit me

1830
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:57,400
Ey...don't hit me

1831
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:58,520
Trying to be smart with cops?

1832
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:00,600
Sir don't, please listen to me

1833
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:00,640
hey...hey let me go.

1834
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:01,880
hey...hey let me go.

1835
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:05,160
Sir, they're young
boys...please don't

1836
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:05,200
-I know them personally
-Arrogance!

1837
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:09,480
-I know them personally
-Arrogance!

1838
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:10,280
don't you dare again

1839
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:11,600
Sir, they're good guys

1840
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:13,600
What are you staring at?

1841
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:45,680
Now shoot!

1842
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:48,400
Can you manage to shoot
at least 6 people?

1843
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:53,160
But the 7th one will burn you
to ashes right here right now.

1844
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:22,960
I thank each and everyone, who are
here to fight for their lives

1845
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:25,840
we tried every possible venue

1846
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:27,080
we've tried knocking
on every door

1847
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:28,400
No door was open to us

1848
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:29,840
not even one soul respected us

1849
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:32,000
This protest is to make
their heads turn.

1850
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,520
To grab the attention of Govt.
and Govt. officers

1851
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:35,880
why should we burn
ourselves alive

1852
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:37,280
How many more lives
are we going to lose?

1853
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:39,000
We shouldn't lose anymore lives.

1854
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:40,520
Why did we elect them?

1855
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
Is it just to link the Aadhar
card number to our mobile?

1856
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:44,080
We're not asking too much

1857
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:47,080
just to divert the excess water
towards the village, we'll use it.

1858
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:50,720
Our farmers were in
Delhi for 45 days---

1859
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:51,800
without any food or water

1860
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:52,920
who cared about it?

1861
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:55,640
Their demands are still not met

1862
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:57,640
but they're ignorant
about these things

1863
01:26:57,960 --> 01:26:59,280
even without doing anything

1864
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:01,920
they fancy us with a 1000 or
2000 rupees during elections

1865
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:03,160
We fake a smile a
and cast our votes

1866
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:05,720
It's in our hands, for
not to repeat this.

1867
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:07,200
Just 'cause the village
is in distress

1868
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:09,320
instead of depending on
the men in our families

1869
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:10,880
each and every women
of our village

1870
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:13,920
are here with their infants
sitting under scorching sun.

1871
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,680
This is our first victory.

1872
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:19,520
Video of a girl winking gets a
million hits in 10 minutes---

1873
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:21,440
---but when the
agriculture is in despair

1874
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:22,880
no one seemed to bother.

1875
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:25,440
Agriculture is the back
bone of our nation---

1876
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:30,040
---but that back bone has worn out
pleading to each and everyone

1877
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:32,400
All the rivers in India were about
to get linked for agriculture,

1878
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:34,760
it's taking forever and
they've killed the notion.

1879
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:39,200
This protest is to let us link
two rivers between the villages.

1880
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:41,320
This is just the beginning

1881
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:43,680
-Shall we protest!?
-We will protest!

1882
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:45,800
-Shall we protest!?
-We will protest!

1883
01:27:57,640 --> 01:27:59,000
Greetings to one and all.

1884
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,200
Don't worry, I'm here
for your troubles.

1885
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:03,160
Hello brother, give me that.

1886
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:10,360
Brother, this
protest of yours---

1887
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:13,880
---should be a victorious one,
my hearty wishes for that.

1888
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:15,760
Starting today, it's
not just your protest

1889
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:16,920
your protest---

1890
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:20,280
---will have full support
of "KAKA-COCO" party.

1891
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:21,800
Sir, thanks for coming

1892
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:24,440
but this is a protest
of our lives

1893
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:26,680
don't turn this into
a political motive.

1894
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:29,680
Brother, it's a very
powerful party,

1895
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:30,600
Think about it.

1896
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:31,360
You can leave Sir.

1897
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:33,760
I said it's a powerful party.

1898
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:34,640
Get lost from here.

1899
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:37,160
Crowd!?

1900
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:38,280
Bravery amidst the crowd?

1901
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:41,400
It's an useless gathering
of the crowd.

1902
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:06,400
Hey, Collector---

1903
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:07,560
---get the hell out here

1904
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:08,760
brother please sit down

1905
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:11,280
Brother, you be quiet.
I'll take care of it.

1906
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:12,760
Come out damn it.

1907
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:14,600
Brother please listen, sit down.

1908
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:16,000
Hey Police get lost from here

1909
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:16,760
Brother...brother

1910
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:17,440
get lost from here.

1911
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:19,520
Sir, he didn't mean to do that

1912
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:20,520
Sir don't hit us

1913
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:22,120
Hey, how are you lay hands on me

1914
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:24,160
Sir, don't hit us

1915
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:25,720
-Ey!
-Enough Sir

1916
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:27,280
Hey....Hey!

1917
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:29,120
-Get lost!
-Oh no!

1918
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:36,400
Oh no!

1919
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:44,600
Oh no, let go.

1920
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:52,360
Sir, don't hit me.

1921
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:15,600
Sir---

1922
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:16,720
---Sir!

1923
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:19,680
Sir, there are kids

1924
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:24,880
Please don't hit us

1925
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:25,840
Stop it

1926
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:27,800
Idiots, stop it

1927
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:28,640
Stop it!

1928
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:30,080
Don't hit the public.

1929
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:31,080
Stop it!

1930
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:33,640
Stop it!

1931
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:34,720
Stop it!

1932
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:35,840
Stop damn it!

1933
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:41,520
Mr.Shakthi, what you're doing
here is public nuisance.

1934
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:42,560
First get that straight.

1935
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:44,880
Facebook protestors like you---

1936
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:47,200
---you're not aware of
practical difficulties.

1937
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:49,560
This has become a fashion now.

1938
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:53,200
Huge gathering of public won't
fetch you any solution.

1939
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:57,000
Sir, don't take me wrong

1940
01:30:57,200 --> 01:30:59,360
we're not protesting
to while away time

1941
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:01,560
We've done agriculture
for generations

1942
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:03,120
we lived our lives sowing seeds

1943
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:04,680
if you ask them to
look for another job

1944
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:05,880
How is that possible?

1945
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:08,200
If he protests against it, you
call them public nuisance

1946
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:11,000
It's you people, who has
brought them on streets

1947
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:13,720
there wasn't any issue until
it was a public protest

1948
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:14,920
violence was infused into it.

1949
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:18,600
It all started when a lot
entered for their filthy gain.

1950
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:20,440
If you can, why don't
you arrest them

1951
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:22,480
Before they infiltrate,
speak to us

1952
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:24,640
Just with spades and crowbars

1953
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:25,760
we can't link rivers.

1954
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:26,880
We have to discuss to reach a solution.

1955
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:30,520
Stale discussions like this has taken
50 years to even shut down a Decree.

1956
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:33,320
This project, without the
support of the Govt.---

1957
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:34,840
without a ground plan

1958
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:37,760
we can't just proceed
with manpower.

1959
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:40,920
Sir, was the big Temple of Thanjavur
was built with latest technology?

1960
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:43,320
foreigners are going
crazy over it

1961
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:46,120
thinking how the 80 tonne stone was
taken all the way on top of the tower.

1962
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:47,800
We're not being hasty
in this situation

1963
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:49,080
We have a presentation

1964
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:50,960

1965
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:09,600

---and you get drunk

So, I have a better deal for you

Shanmugam!

2095
01:41:13,680 --> 01:41:14,880
Shanmugam!

2096
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:17,280
Shanmugam!

2097
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:22,080
Oh no!

2098
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:24,640
Please comeback to life

2099
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:30,800
Shakthi!

2100
01:41:31,080 --> 01:41:32,480
Everything got buried into sand

2101
01:41:32,720 --> 01:41:34,120
Shakthi look at this mess

2102
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:37,640
Shakthi look what has
happened to everyone

2103
01:41:38,040 --> 01:41:38,880
Son---

2104
01:41:40,040 --> 01:41:42,720
Ey...look Shakthi is here

2105
01:41:42,720 --> 01:41:43,720
Oh God!

2106
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:46,280
Shakthi look at him---

2107
01:41:50,160 --> 01:41:50,880
Ey...!

2108
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:53,160
Ey...Shanmugam!

2109
01:41:53,320 --> 01:41:54,000
Ey!

2110
01:41:57,880 --> 01:41:59,320
Look at this mess---

2111
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:00,960
he has left us behind

2112
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:01,880
Oh no!

2113
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:05,760
Brother...!

2114
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:11,240
OH NO...!

2115
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:17,320
21 died in that landslide.

2116
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:20,760
Shakthi felt guilty that
it was all his fault.

2117
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:24,080
That was the last
time I saw Shakthi

2118
01:42:24,440 --> 01:42:25,480
I looked for him everywhere.

2119
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:28,320
No clue on the complaint
registered with Police.

2120
01:42:30,200 --> 01:42:33,040
But if his face was
donated to you---

2121
01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:35,640
---then Shakthi must've
met with an accident.

2122
01:42:36,360 --> 01:42:37,920
What happened with Shakthi
wasn't an accident.

2123
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:39,600
It was murder.

2124
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:46,160
They're under the impression
that I'm Shakthi,

2125
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:47,840
and are behind me.

2126
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:52,760
I even inquired the person
who signed for my surgery

2127
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:54,520
even she is not aware of him.

2128
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:55,520
Maya!

2129
01:42:55,880 --> 01:42:57,120
From what you're saying---

2130
01:42:57,120 --> 01:42:59,040
---I suspect that Councilor
must be behind it

2131
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:00,200
Not him---

2132
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:03,080
---he was killed in
a party scuffle.

2133
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:06,160
He was angry with us

2134
01:43:06,360 --> 01:43:08,000
but not to the level
of killing Shakthi.

2135
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:10,320
Maya, if you don't mind---

2136
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:13,760
can I see the details on the
river inter-linking project?

2137
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:24,920
This is Shakthi's laptop

2138
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:26,640
all details are stored in it

2139
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:28,360
but the password---

2140
01:43:28,360 --> 01:43:29,320
---I don't know the password

2141
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:31,360
Shall I give it a try?

2142
01:43:43,480 --> 01:43:44,240
Shiva!

2143
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:46,960
This has face recognition option

2144
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:08,040
Hey!

2145
01:44:13,640 --> 01:44:16,120
I went through the details about
the river linking project.

2146
01:44:16,120 --> 01:44:16,840
Really amazing!

2147
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:18,240
In order to progress
our nation's GDP

2148
01:44:18,240 --> 01:44:21,000
all the rivers in India should be
link and agriculture should develop.

2149
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:22,560
In order to help
executing this project,

2150
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:25,720
from our US Tamil LLC
I'm sending $50,000

2151
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:27,480
Tiny contribution
to our homeland.

2152
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:31,200
Look here, it's 10 TMC of water

2153
01:44:31,200 --> 01:44:33,000
It's going vain into the sea.

2154
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:34,320
In order to get this
into our village

2155
01:44:34,360 --> 01:44:36,720
and develop agriculture,
Shakthi is struggling for us.

2156
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:40,240
You people never liked the
fact, if farmers are happy.

2157
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:41,560
No matter what happens,

2158
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:44,120
we will make sure to link
this water to Kalyani river

2159
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:48,280
Share this as much as possible, so
it will reach all the officials.

2160
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:55,760
Maya, isn't this your email-id?

2161
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:57,360
That's right, it's my id.

2162
01:44:57,720 --> 01:44:58,920
But it's not delivered.

2163
01:44:59,120 --> 01:45:01,480
He was trying to send
an email on June 5th.

2164
01:45:01,640 --> 01:45:04,280
due to wrong email address,
it wasn't delivered.

2165
01:45:04,760 --> 01:45:05,680
Open it.

2166
01:45:12,280 --> 01:45:13,280
Maya!

2167
01:45:20,360 --> 01:45:21,200
Maya!

2168
01:45:22,720 --> 01:45:25,840
I'm not sure, I'll
be alive tomorrow

2169
01:45:27,160 --> 01:45:28,960
but you have to know the truth.

2170
01:45:38,440 --> 01:45:39,200
Shakthi!?

2171
01:45:40,160 --> 01:45:41,320
How come you're here?

2172
01:45:41,320 --> 01:45:43,320
21 people who died
in that land slide

2173
01:45:43,320 --> 01:45:45,600
they're stating you're the reason for
it and there's an FIR against you.

2174
01:45:46,040 --> 01:45:47,200
You better leave from here.

2175
01:45:49,320 --> 01:45:49,920
Sir---

2176
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:52,240
It was in Shanmugam's hand

2177
01:46:11,120 --> 01:46:12,440
This wasn't a landslide.

2178
01:46:13,320 --> 01:46:15,320
It was pre-planned set up

2179
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:16,240
Bomb!

2180
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:18,040
We shouldn't let this go.

2181
01:46:18,520 --> 01:46:19,760
Let's go to the
commissioner right away.

2182
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:21,120
Also will inform the media.

2183
01:46:21,120 --> 01:46:22,320
moreover the people
of our village

2184
01:46:22,320 --> 01:46:23,880
Ok, don't panic

2185
01:46:23,880 --> 01:46:25,160
this has to be handled
in the right way

2186
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:26,760
First I have to inform the AC,

2187
01:46:26,760 --> 01:46:28,440
wait for a minute,
I'll get my phone

2188
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:37,320
Just a minute

2189
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:42,080
Hello! Sir good evening.

2190
01:46:42,720 --> 01:46:42,760
Yes Sir, Shakthi is right here.

2191
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:44,920
Yes Sir, Shakthi is right here.

2192
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:45,880
He's a good person.

2193
01:46:45,880 --> 01:46:47,280
It's not his fault.

2194
01:46:47,320 --> 01:46:48,880
I'll bring him in 10 mins.

2195
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:50,080
Ok Sir!

2196
01:46:50,720 --> 01:46:52,320
Ok Sir, thank you...thank you.

2197
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:54,440
I'll get ready

2198
01:46:54,520 --> 01:46:55,400
wait for a moment.

2199
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:51,240
There is no agriculture
here, Sir.

2200
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:52,720
It's an empty land.

2201
01:47:52,760 --> 01:47:54,640
It will show clearly
in your camera.

2202
01:47:54,680 --> 01:47:56,800
The people of this
village are fools.

2203
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:58,040
we can take it from them easily.

2204
01:47:58,040 --> 01:48:00,200
But my commission is 5%.

2205
01:48:00,200 --> 01:48:01,360
Do you understand, Sir?

2206
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:03,400
"If someone harms you"

2207
01:48:03,440 --> 01:48:05,680
"Do good unto them"

2208
01:48:05,680 --> 01:48:06,240
Ok!?

2209
01:48:06,240 --> 01:48:07,280
Wow!

2210
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:10,200
Beautifully spoken,
Thiruvalluar will be happy.

2211
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:13,520
We've taken a lot of money from
you, shouldn't be asking this

2212
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:15,080
still can't help it

2213
01:48:15,080 --> 01:48:17,280
you've extracted
enough gas already

2214
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:19,080
what is left to extract now?

2215
01:48:19,480 --> 01:48:22,200
We've contributed enough
to the gas industry

2216
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:23,760
this is something else.

2217
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:26,360
"Private Electricity"

2218
01:48:27,160 --> 01:48:30,880
You've taken care of
electricity for long

2219
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:35,120
we'll share half the
responsibility of your Govt.

2220
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:38,000
You've privatized buses

2221
01:48:38,360 --> 01:48:39,920
Banks are privatized

2222
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:39,960
You didn't spare the
Education system too

2223
01:48:40,040 --> 01:48:41,800
You didn't spare the
Education system too

2224
01:48:41,800 --> 01:48:44,960
Only the water you've
paid for is pure,

2225
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:47,120
water which is available for
free, will cause disease

2226
01:48:47,120 --> 01:48:48,200
you people privatized
that as well.

2227
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:50,160
And when it came to telephones
in the name of "Tels"

2228
01:48:50,160 --> 01:48:52,000
you guys privatized that as well.

2229
01:48:52,160 --> 01:48:54,720
Now you're turning electricity
into private sector

2230
01:48:54,720 --> 01:48:55,680
what's next!?

2231
01:48:56,720 --> 01:48:57,320
Trains!?

2232
01:48:57,440 --> 01:48:59,800
Oh! So that's in pipeline too

2233
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:02,040
We're investing 500
crores in this project

2234
01:49:02,360 --> 01:49:05,520
and have decided to rake in profits
up to 2000 crores, that's EDICOS's plan.

2235
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:07,600
The only goal of a
businessman is---

2236
01:49:08,240 --> 01:49:09,200
---Profits!

2237
01:49:09,240 --> 01:49:11,680
So, there will be no empathy.

2238
01:49:24,640 --> 01:49:26,320
When someone is not selfish,

2239
01:49:26,440 --> 01:49:27,840
cares about everyone

2240
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:29,960
and when he gets
down to help them.

2241
01:49:30,080 --> 01:49:33,880
In the end he gets defeated
by slimy dogs like you.

2242
01:49:33,880 --> 01:49:34,760
You're right Shakthi

2243
01:49:35,320 --> 01:49:38,520
how many can I keep killing
in the name of money

2244
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:40,280
You didn't lose to me at the end

2245
01:49:40,280 --> 01:49:42,000
it's me who has been
giving you a run around.

2246
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:45,040
When this project begun, you
came with the river linking plan

2247
01:49:45,120 --> 01:49:47,200
convinced and confused the
people with agriculture

2248
01:49:47,200 --> 01:49:49,160
and lead them not to
sell their lands.

2249
01:49:49,160 --> 01:49:50,120
If we achieve this

2250
01:49:50,120 --> 01:49:51,920
our village agriculture won't
be dependent on rains.

2251
01:49:52,240 --> 01:49:55,880
Through the same company
which fired you

2252
01:49:56,120 --> 01:49:57,920
I planned to send you America.

2253
01:49:57,920 --> 01:49:59,160
We're hiring you guys back

2254
01:49:59,160 --> 01:50:00,920
Thanks for firing
us from that job.

2255
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:02,680
we love what we're
doing at the moment.

2256
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:03,680
And that Councilor---

2257
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:06,280
---for making him win
all the elections

2258
01:50:06,440 --> 01:50:08,640
was useful to me for
the first time.

2259
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:11,160
Instead sell it all to me

2260
01:50:11,160 --> 01:50:13,280
and be happy with the money
it will fetch you guys.

2261
01:50:13,280 --> 01:50:18,040
Do you remember getting
arrested for no reason?

2262
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:21,560
But still you managed to gather
the public and protested

2263
01:50:21,800 --> 01:50:23,760
also got permission
from the Collector.

2264
01:50:23,800 --> 01:50:25,080
-Shall we protest?
-We will protest!

2265
01:50:25,080 --> 01:50:26,240
-Shall we protest?
-We will protest!

2266
01:50:26,240 --> 01:50:28,320
So I sent two of my
men into the crowd

2267
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:32,360
You got the permission
from the collector

2268
01:50:33,120 --> 01:50:35,080
You got the permission
from the collector

2269
01:50:36,080 --> 01:50:37,280
I was left with no choice

2270
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:40,760
I planned to use the same pit,
you people dug as their graves.

2271
01:50:46,280 --> 01:50:47,840
Man-made Landslide!

2272
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:50,160
For public it seemed like
a natural Landslide.

2273
01:50:50,160 --> 01:50:52,360
But it was my set up all along.

2274
01:50:52,360 --> 01:50:54,320
This is still not the vital plan

2275
01:50:54,920 --> 01:50:56,200
the reason for the death toll

2276
01:50:56,520 --> 01:50:59,720
I wanted to frame you for that.

2277
01:51:00,440 --> 01:51:03,280
But your friend sniffed out
something before his death

2278
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:03,800
right!?

2279
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:14,480
Air and water, the gifts of nature. You guys
have made it impossible to even enjoy them

2280
01:51:15,120 --> 01:51:17,240
In the name of capitalism
and survival of the fittest

2281
01:51:17,280 --> 01:51:19,000
you just look after yourself.

2282
01:51:21,640 --> 01:51:23,760
Just for your gain---

2283
01:51:23,880 --> 01:51:25,160
---21 lives!

2284
01:51:25,160 --> 01:51:27,880
There are many lives on this earth

2285
01:51:28,600 --> 01:51:30,000
just like the worms.

2286
01:51:30,440 --> 01:51:31,720
But when you build a factory

2287
01:51:31,720 --> 01:51:33,600
or you're digging a
hole, they tend to die.

2288
01:51:34,080 --> 01:51:37,040
To me it was 21
worms which died.

2289
01:51:37,640 --> 01:51:39,560
Now another worm
is about to die.

2290
01:52:26,720 --> 01:52:27,280
Hey!

2291
01:52:28,680 --> 01:52:30,320
Do you peck yourself for a
big revolutionary leader,

2292
01:52:31,440 --> 01:52:32,600
what are you going to do now?

2293
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:34,880
Ey!

2294
01:52:35,880 --> 01:52:36,400
Hey!

2295
01:52:39,960 --> 01:52:40,960
Shakthi!

2296
01:53:57,600 --> 01:53:59,200
Die damn it!

2297
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:50,640
Ah...Shit!

2298
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:24,800
Maya!

2299
01:55:26,480 --> 01:55:29,960
I'm not sure if I'll
be alive tomorrow

2300
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:32,640
But you need to know the
truth about few things---

2301
01:55:45,120 --> 01:55:47,320
Hey Muruga, who is this?

2302
01:55:47,320 --> 01:55:49,320
no idea, when did
get on the truck?

2303
01:55:51,640 --> 01:55:53,680
Fine, let's leave
before someone sees us.

2304
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:03,240
Can you please open your eyes?

2305
01:56:05,440 --> 01:56:06,800
What was our fault?

2306
01:56:08,440 --> 01:56:10,680
Our village, and for
our agriculture

2307
01:56:10,760 --> 01:56:12,840
water...we were
trying get water.

2308
01:56:13,080 --> 01:56:14,480
a bomb was planted instead.

2309
01:56:15,360 --> 01:56:17,320
21 lives were buried alive

2310
01:56:17,800 --> 01:56:18,480
and killed.

2311
01:56:19,720 --> 01:56:21,000
On top of it, Shakthi too

2312
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:24,800
only people of this
stature can survive?

2313
01:56:54,640 --> 01:56:56,120
Sir...Sir!

2314
01:57:00,840 --> 01:57:01,440
Sir!

2315
01:57:23,320 --> 01:57:26,160
When I saw you panic
in order to save me---

2316
01:57:26,680 --> 01:57:28,440
---I understood that
you're not him.

2317
01:57:30,080 --> 01:57:31,320
-You...!?
-Sir!

2318
01:57:32,480 --> 01:57:34,400
-You!?
-Don't close your eyes, look at me.

2319
01:57:34,680 --> 01:57:34,720
look at me, Sir.

2320
01:57:34,760 --> 01:57:35,920
look at me, Sir.

2321
01:57:36,680 --> 01:57:37,320
Sir!

2322
01:57:37,800 --> 01:57:41,680
I collected information
pertaining to you

2323
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:48,240
Hereafter my men
won't trouble you.

2324
01:57:49,160 --> 01:57:49,720
Leave!

2325
01:57:52,080 --> 01:57:53,440
Suraj is your name right!?

2326
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:59,800
If the power plant project for private
electricity didn't take off---

2327
01:58:00,360 --> 01:58:02,320
---you would've been
on streets begging

2328
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,800
destroying the people of the
village and their agriculture

2329
01:58:07,880 --> 01:58:10,520
it's not necessary for you to make
a living out of their misery.

2330
01:58:11,400 --> 01:58:11,840
Hey!

2331
01:58:13,360 --> 01:58:18,360
But for your gain, you've
killed 22 people, without mercy

2332
01:58:20,680 --> 01:58:21,800
how do you know so much?

2333
01:58:22,480 --> 01:58:23,880
I thought you're not Shakthi.

2334
01:58:25,600 --> 01:58:27,160
So what If I'm not Shakthi---

2335
01:58:27,240 --> 01:58:29,040
---that doesn’t justify
you're right.

2336
01:58:31,920 --> 01:58:33,160
Police - 1 Lac

2337
01:58:33,640 --> 01:58:35,080
PWD officer - 3 Lacs

2338
01:58:35,080 --> 01:58:36,680
and Councilor - 10 Lacs

2339
01:58:37,160 --> 01:58:39,200
Just for the sake of money

2340
01:58:39,200 --> 01:58:42,200
they came behind you wagging
their tail like dogs.

2341
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:44,040
But Shakthi---

2342
01:58:44,320 --> 01:58:45,480
---don't know he was

2343
01:58:45,800 --> 01:58:48,400
He gave me a new
life with a new face

2344
01:58:50,240 --> 01:58:51,720
What can I do for him?

2345
01:58:54,600 --> 01:58:55,880
Shiva, I've read in a novel

2346
01:58:56,200 --> 01:58:59,720
If Epidefrine is induced into
someone's body in abundance

2347
01:58:59,720 --> 01:59:01,440
will die of excess adrenaline.

2348
01:59:09,120 --> 01:59:10,960
Are you struggling to breathe?

2349
01:59:11,440 --> 01:59:13,720
I've increased the level
of adrenaline in your body

2350
01:59:13,960 --> 01:59:15,480
you're going to die
of suffocation.

2351
01:59:17,320 --> 01:59:18,920
It can't be traced
even in post-mortem.

2352
01:59:21,960 --> 01:59:22,920
Life is a Bi---

2353
01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:30,600
Life is a Boomerang!

2354
02:00:37,400 --> 02:00:42,080
♪ when the source of the
life goes through agony

2355
02:00:42,080 --> 02:00:45,960
♪ life gives way to it.

2356
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:52,560
♪ Even if you're
sown like a seed,

2357
02:00:52,840 --> 02:00:58,000
♪ when you stand tall, the
air will embrace you.

2358
02:00:58,160 --> 02:01:07,960
♪ The future will take
a shape from the fire

2359
02:01:08,280 --> 02:01:12,960
♪ A new face will be born---

2360
02:01:13,400 --> 02:01:17,760
♪ at the dawn...at the dawn!
