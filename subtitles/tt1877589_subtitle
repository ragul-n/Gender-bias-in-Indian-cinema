DEEPAK DEV

2
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,675
REVENUE OFFICER
KERALA GOVERNMENT

3
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:04,730
Thank God!
See who is coming?

4
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:06,202
Good Morning Sir

5
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,274
Come here!

6
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:16,043
Don't you guys know him?
He is the revenue officer..

7
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:17,979
-Mr. Balgopal Menon
-Greetings!

8
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:20,109
And he is Rajan Thampi,

9
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:21,379
My elder son..

10
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,786
He is looking after my
hotels and bars in Cochin

11
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:27,187
He is my son-in-law..
Manoj Varma

12
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,693
Husband of my daughter Radha

13
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:32,856
He oversees our Estate at Peerumed

14
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:34,728
So your youngest son is in police?

15
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,359
Yes. Third man.. Hariharan Thampy.

16
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:46,769
He has recently taken over
as the city police commissioner

17
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:51,815
We are looking for a girl for him.
May finalize one soon.

18
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:53,749
I say this not because he is my son..

19
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,320
He has no bad habits.

20
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:57,889
Neither smokes nor drinks!

21
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:03,325
And he nevertakes kickbacks.

22
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:08,357
Being honest, if I had a daughter
I would marry her off to him.

23
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:09,799
Sir, you'd better finish that drink.

24
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:11,870
Let's go to see the place
without wasting time.

25
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:25,113
I was saying about this 450 acres land.

26
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:29,814
We have been holding this land
since the time of ourforefathers.

27
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:33,448
He says that there is a good chance
of a tourist resort in this area.

28
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,823
A collaboration with a Canadian firm.

29
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:40,797
We plan a big project with
paragliding, helipad etc

30
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,265
But for bank loan..

31
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:44,336
-Papers of the property should be correct.
-Yes. You said it.

32
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,864
There is no document to prove
the ownership of this land now.

33
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:49,441
-We have to make title
deeds for the property. -Yes.

34
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:54,479
Since there is no other claimant for
the land, it can be done.

35
00:06:54,580 --> 00:07:02,043
If it happens, an apartment right
in the city will be gifted to you.

36
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,147
Why not?

37
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:08,054
But I can't do it alone.

38
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:10,487
You need to manage the minister too.

39
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:14,060
The village officer should forward
a certificate to me stating that

40
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:18,501
there are no other claimants
to this land which remains

41
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:24,099
Unregistered and there is no
objection to grant title deed.

42
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,444
I'll speak to the village officer.

43
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:37,512
No sir. This land is handed down during
the King's rule, as it is heard.

44
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:42,620
Here we have details of deeds
which are some 100 years old.

45
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:45,295
I need time to check them all.

46
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:47,593
You don't dig out the past

47
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:53,597
Just forward a certificate to me that
there is no other claimant to the land

48
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:54,931
Let me see sir..

49
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,054
Come my boy

50
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,290
The younger one has come.
Hariharan Thampy.

51
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:15,485
And he is Mr. Balagopal from Munnar.

52
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:17,495
I was somewhere near to this Guest House.
It was for a raid.

53
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,488
Then came dad's call that he is here.

54
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:20,996
-Please sit down.
-Thank you

55
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,032
Brother

56
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,633
I have some money in the jeep.

57
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:29,067
That's extracted from the raid.

58
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:30,374
Give that money to dad.

59
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:32,501
Ok. I am just coming.

60
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:37,607
Village officer is calling.

61
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:39,478
I am Thomas Palamattom speaking.

62
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:42,076
-So you did it.
-No sir.

63
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:45,387
I found some title deeds and

64
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:48,518
documents pertaining to this land
while checking some old files.

65
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:51,988
I told you not to search all those crap.

66
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,694
Are you getting dumb, man?

67
00:08:55,501 --> 00:09:00,962
Sir, there is some problem in
granting title deed to that 450 acres

68
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:02,165
What problem?

69
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:07,507
As per records the land you referred
is part of the 750 acres allotted by the

70
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:13,574
Then king to Christian Missionaries for
building church, school, orphanage etc.

71
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:19,057
That 450 acres beside the big
church belongs to them only.

72
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:22,286
Why are you digging out
things past 100 years?

73
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:25,625
Even the church doesn't know the fact.

74
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:30,262
Kumaran Thampy possess documents to

75
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:33,032
substantiate his claim for the title deed

76
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:34,333
as perthe Land assignment law.

77
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,738
Those are fake documents made by them.

78
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,738
We have the original documents to prove.

79
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:40,979
You burn it off.
Problems will be over then.

80
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,707
Tell him what we would offer

81
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:46,075
If you just overlook this,
they would place millions in your hands.

82
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:49,186
No Sir. I cannot facilitate corruption.

83
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,550
Sir, the village officer
intends to confront us.

84
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:58,721
The documents with him
could put us in difficulty.

85
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,697
If such a document is with him,
It's life is of only one day.

86
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:09,502
No evidence will remain further
to unearth the history.

87
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,736
Take my words!
This is Kunnel Kumaran Thampy saying.

88
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:30,389
Brother, I am giving the documents to you

89
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:31,690
because it is not safe
to keep this in office.

90
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:36,131
This will be taken out of the
locker only when you demand it.

91
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:43,503
-Let no one know about it.
-Yes, I understand.

92
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:45,939
The place meant forthe
school should come to it

93
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:51,247
I'll start. I've to reach Munnar
before it gets dark

94
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,610
You take care.

95
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:56,312
If they fail to influence,
they would harm you.

96
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,253
They are people without conscience.

97
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,255
But they will not get me.

98
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:02,088
I will be off work for 2 months.

99
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:04,429
I am going to Velankanni
shrine next morning.

100
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:07,464
A lot of offerings to make!

101
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:09,727
I want to join one month
meditation too. See you!

102
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,502
Bye

103
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:39,130
Where are you going in haste?

104
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,526
Don't be afraid!
Get down

105
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,191
We won't do anything

106
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,839
I am unable to sleep..

107
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:52,469
Thinking how to reciprocate
to the favour you do me!

108
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,376
He says me to give you Rs. 2 Lacs.

109
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,845
But I feel it is not enough.

110
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:58,474
Take this. 4 Lacs.

111
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:00,209
No. I don't take this.

112
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:01,377
Oh God!

113
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,785
I am first time meeting a man
who is allergenic to money.

114
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,254
If you don't want..
That's fine

115
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:08,351
Dad, here is the bag

116
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,486
-You open and see it.
-Don't take it.

117
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:11,927
-Don't take it!
-You come here man.

118
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:13,597
-My bag!
-Come here

119
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,500
The documents and title needs which l
need are no more in the village office

120
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:20,504
That may be in the bag

121
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:25,542
I am eager to know
What is there in it

122
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,608
Its just Photostat

123
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:32,544
We want original document
Not the Photostat

124
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:34,619
-Where is it?
-It's not with me

125
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,210
Not with you?

126
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:40,487
Thomas, do you see this?

127
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:44,558
Since my petty job at the country
liquor shop, I am used to all this

128
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:47,461
I will not threaten you that I stab you.

129
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:49,727
I will threaten you
only after stabbing.

130
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:50,824
Like this!

131
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:55,735
You will be saved
if rushed to hospital.

132
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:59,400
Tell me if you want to live.

133
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:01,980
You will not get it
even if I am dead.

134
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:04,509
The property of the Church
would go to Church only.

135
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:08,716
My brotherwill be
there to fight for justice.

136
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:14,923
Jesus!

137
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:38,540
-Take his body in his carto our estate.
-Ok, dad

138
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,915
You call the crane guy Murugan

139
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,319
Dump his body into
the marshy field in our estate

140
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:46,989
The outside world should
find no trace of him

141
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:04,907
Capt. Varghese Mopila

142
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:19,013
-Yes.
-Don't you know me?

143
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:21,658
-No.
-You don't know him?

144
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,660
He is Kumaran Thampy.

145
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:27,027
Oh.. Kunnel Kumaran Thampy.

146
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,801
I heard a lot.

147
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:36,072
The clever man who kills his
opponents and raise the sycophants!

148
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,939
It's not true just stories
cooked by the jealous

149
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:42,138
-Why did you come to me?
-Oh No..

150
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:43,909
I came not for you but to
meet your brother Thomas

151
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:44,880
He is not here

152
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:45,916
Where did he go?

153
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:47,918
-He has gone on a long journey.
-When is he expected back?

154
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,578
It may take one or two months

155
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:53,146
As he is like a free bird,
there is no timeline for his return

156
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:56,592
Oh.. It's so sad!

157
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:57,525
What is the matter?

158
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:02,895
Thomas said that he has given
some papers of his office here

159
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:08,697
No such paper is here

160
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:14,143
The honest, strict and
patriotic Varghese Mopila..

161
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,976
Started telling lies in this old age..?

162
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,982
We know it is here
Give it to us!

163
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,245
Those papers are related with our business

164
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:23,617
-Mopila, don't create problems..
-Don't want

165
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:26,350
In any business, middlemen
should also get benefitted.

166
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:27,614
You can ask whatever you want.

167
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:29,853
I have never done business
with the assets of almighty.

168
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,259
That I will never do.

169
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:35,396
He speaks as if he
owns the reserve bank.

170
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:37,033
Mr. Kumaran Thampi..

171
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:38,669
Look at that Bungalow.

172
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:42,801
My son bought my neighbour's land

173
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:46,002
for a high price and built
that for some 15 millions.

174
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:56,718
It is still locked up because
I feel that his money smells blood.

175
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:00,850
The income which I had generated
from 30 years of my military service

176
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,123
couldn't even match a three year
revenue from my ancestral property.

177
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:09,359
I served the nation overlooking my family.
Yet it was for my satisfaction.

178
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:13,302
My eyes won't blink in
sight of your paper currency.

179
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:15,134
To hell with his status
and family history!

180
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:16,263
You go inside and check..

181
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,867
-No sir, please don't do.
-Move aside. -You..!

182
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,641
I'll hack you

183
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:23,806
You go and check guys..

184
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,952
Even if you scour the entire house,
you won't get any document.

185
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:33,182
That's not here.

186
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,759
It's true that Uncle gave
some papers to dad.

187
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:39,725
But he instantly put them
in the bank's locker.

188
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:44,698
Oh.. your daughter is very clever!

189
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:48,464
If I roam here a nuisance,
your spinster daughter

190
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:51,107
would lose her peace.

191
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:57,205
Varghese Mopila..
You have fear thinking of daughter!

192
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:59,284
And you fluttered a bit.. Isn't it?

193
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:03,477
I remained unwavered even at the
enemy bullets fired from the borders

194
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:08,249
You are nothing in
front of such a man!

195
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,827
Get out

196
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:11,953
Leave it..

197
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,859
He will come my way.
Otherwise I would make him!

198
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:33,343
My daughter did it smart..

199
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:35,920
It was good to say that the docs
were kept in bank locker

200
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,786
They are relentless people
They would come back soon..

201
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,422
Why don't we call our elder
son back from Mumbai?

202
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:43,517
Shut your mouth..

203
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:45,896
Don't even say his
name in this house..

204
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,994
I care hoots for him

205
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:53,263
I would rather die by Kumaran Thampy
than seeking help from him

206
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:02,344
Varghese..

207
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:08,483
Bishop wished to see you.

208
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:09,451
What is the matter?

209
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:12,490
I think it's about your younger son Joji

210
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:17,226
Varghese, I sent Joji to ltaly

211
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:22,432
for higher studies at your request
with the financial support of Church.

212
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:25,833
I hoped we would get an educated priest.

213
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:28,571
He has now decided to
give up the priesthood.

214
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:33,142
He has abandoned the holy
attire and joined some company.

215
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,179
Don't you have any answer?

216
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,976
He may not have the divine call, Bishop.

217
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:43,953
But you need to enquire
what caused him to leave the priesthood.

218
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:08,536
I have come to Rome to become a Priest.

219
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,639
Then why God, you sent that..

220
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,043
doe-eyed angel before me.

221
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:22,116
Meenakshi's tinkling smile dragged
me to London where she lives.

222
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:26,519
Why did you show her beautiful figure

223
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:28,657
in my mind where you alone dwelt..?

224
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:34,467
Jesus, then it's you yourself who lured

225
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:38,304
me to jump the parish fence
as high as the Great Chinese Wall.

226
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:41,039
Now what shall this servant of God do?

227
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:45,949
What?

228
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:52,148
Let it be, if that is yourwish!
She must come right at this moment.

229
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:55,226
Then only shall I go to her life.

230
00:19:55,394 --> 00:20:00,127
Jesus, let her come at the usual time.

231
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:03,367
Jesus! Make it happen

232
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:14,578
Thank you.. Thank you so much..

233
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:20,450
Go man..

234
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:24,719
See Jeesus..

235
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,220
She has been ignoring me for long.

236
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:31,093
What.. What..?
To go and woo her?

237
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:34,731
Then I won't spare her, Jesus!
Then I won't spare.

238
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:37,499
Spare thee not, gal

239
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,297
Spare thee not, dear,

240
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,099
Spare thee not, gal

241
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:43,003
I will not spare thee

242
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,633
Spare thee not, gal

243
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,404
Spare thee not, dear,

244
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:48,274
Spare thee not, gal

245
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,245
I will not spare thee

246
00:20:57,356 --> 00:21:00,757
I will not spare thee

247
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,622
Spare thee not, gal

248
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:04,423
Spare thee not, dear,

249
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:06,292
Spare thee not, gal

250
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:08,093
I will not spare thee

251
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:15,299
Gal, I will not.

252
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,305
When you commanded, my god

253
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:22,540
In my dedicated mind,
I gave room for a gracious girl!

254
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:26,277
You commanded, my god
To share my heart,

255
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:29,582
And give the due to my sweetheart!

256
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:32,816
Alighted she then, as an angel

257
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:36,492
Lit the candle of love
In the altar of my heart!

258
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:40,087
Then showered on me her sweet smiles!

259
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:43,067
Never, my gal, shall I leave

260
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:44,692
Never shall I dear

261
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,670
Never shall I leave you

262
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:51,368
My girl. Never, my gal, shall I leave,

263
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:54,809
Never, my dear, unto death
Shall I leave your hand.

264
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,609
When you commanded, my god

265
00:21:56,715 --> 00:22:01,846
In my dedicated mind,
I gave room for a gracious girl!

266
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,578
You commanded, my god
To share my heart,

267
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:09,183
And give the due to my sweetheart!

268
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:12,286
Alighted she then, as an angel

269
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:15,798
Lit the candle of love
In the altar of my heart!

270
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:19,496
Then showered on me her sweet smiles!

271
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:21,572
Never, my gal, shall I leave

272
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,402
Never shall I dear

273
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:27,171
Never shall I leave you

274
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:30,680
My girl. Never, my gal, shall I leave,

275
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:34,479
Never, my dear, unto death
Shall I leave your hand.

276
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:36,811
My girl..

277
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:38,753
Don't do..

278
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,226
Don't do..

279
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,124
Don't do..

280
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:51,902
Don't do..

281
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:53,464
Don't do..

282
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:58,901
That day, at the Church,
When we happened to meet,

283
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:02,741
Bewildered me, girl, thou
With your playful eyes.

284
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:06,249
Never, ever, we meant to meet in life,

285
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:09,479
But there you, standing afar,
grabbed my life!

286
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:10,247
I can't bear it

287
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:13,347
Unable, though, to meet as customary,

288
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:16,791
The Gracious Lord has
harmonized with my will

289
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:20,592
Having filled up with the rain clouds,

290
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:22,524
Never, my gal, shall I leave

291
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:24,363
Never shall I dear

292
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:27,961
Never shall I leave you

293
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:31,674
My girl. Never, my gal, shall I leave,

294
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:35,611
Never, my dear, unto death
Shall I leave your hand.

295
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:37,274
Then..

296
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:39,347
Then..

297
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:41,944
Oh my god! It's become a nuisance

298
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:01,663
The brilliant bridal cloth of

299
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:05,675
moonlight kept ready,

300
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:08,837
Along we go the countryside singing aloud,

301
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:12,781
And invite one and all for the nuptials

302
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:15,876
Once our parents venture reprimand,

303
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:19,650
I will show them the figure
of our Lord!

304
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:23,421
Now, let anybody say, as they wish!

305
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:25,356
Never, my gal, shall I leave

306
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,056
Never shall I dear

307
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:30,768
Never shall I leave you

308
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:34,464
My girl. Never, my gal, shall I leave,

309
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:37,872
Never, my dear, unto death
Shall I leave your hand.

310
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,739
When you commanded, my god

311
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:44,976
In my dedicated mind,
I gave room for a gracious girl!

312
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:48,314
Alighted she then, as an angel

313
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,856
Lit the candle of love
In the altar of my heart!

314
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:55,586
Then showered on me her sweet smiles!

315
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,586
Never, my gal, shall I leave

316
00:24:57,696 --> 00:24:59,425
Never shall I dear

317
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:03,058
Never shall I leave you

318
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:06,729
My girl. Never, my gal, shall I leave,

319
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:10,468
Never, my dear, unto death
Shall I leave your hand.

320
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:11,837
Never, my gal, shall I leave

321
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:13,706
Never shall I dear

322
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:17,509
Never shall I leave you

323
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:20,949
My girl. Never, my gal, shall I leave,

324
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:24,818
Never, my dear, unto death
Shall I leave your hand.

325
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:55,381
He is a Malayali..
Joji Varghese.

326
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:57,546
My god! Is he a Christian?

327
00:25:57,656 --> 00:25:59,385
If somebody comes to know
about this back home..

328
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:01,152
I can't think of it.
She is the daughter of a minister..

329
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:02,984
I wonder if the media know about this?

330
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:06,656
Don't waste your time discussing this.
Dad, you call Uncle and tell him.

331
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:10,394
They have sent Meenakshi here for studies
trusting that we would take care.

332
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:11,457
Call him

333
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:19,743
-I am Shekaran Kutty..
-Yes.. I give to him.

334
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:23,880
-Who is it?
-Your brother from London..

335
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,245
-Brother..
-Are you busy now?

336
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:29,951
I am to leave for Trivandrum.
What's up there?

337
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:31,816
-That is..
-Dad.. give to me.

338
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:33,646
Uncle, I am Vinod.

339
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:36,090
Yes.. Vinod. Meenakshi has not called
up fortwo three days.

340
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:37,183
She has exams..

341
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:40,460
Oh.. I forgot about her exams!

342
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:43,627
She has an affair with a guy.

343
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:46,835
We came to know that
he is a Christian.

344
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:47,961
I will finish her off.

345
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,070
Don't be panic!

346
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:53,474
Let's not make a fuss about it.

347
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:56,576
I will take care of him!

348
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:57,739
You do one thing, Vinod.

349
00:26:57,849 --> 00:26:59,874
Try to send her back
by playing some tactics..

350
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:10,850
What is the matter?

351
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:14,020
What happened?
Why are you crying?

352
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:17,657
Joji, I am going back in
tomorrow morning flight.

353
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:19,532
Why at such short notice?

354
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:23,039
My father is hospitalized

355
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,904
His condition is said to be not serious.

356
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,906
But I am nervous.

357
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:30,703
Keep your cool.
Nothing will happen to him.

358
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:33,112
Don't worry..
I'll also accompany you.

359
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:35,779
Wait for me at airport.
I'll reach there

360
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:02,143
My friends want to be familiar with you.

361
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:03,771
You are going to the airport, isn't it?

362
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:07,015
How dare you think of loving Meenakshi?

363
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,549
Meenakshi won't return here

364
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:16,321
It was our plan
to make her go there

365
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:19,856
Your damn passport!

366
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,131
My passport..

367
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:25,100
You want to make love with
Home Minister's daughter, isn't it?

368
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:29,739
Oh my God!

369
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:35,900
Uncle, what happened to Dad?

370
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:37,736
Nothing to fear, you get in

371
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:02,221
Yes.. Viji

372
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:06,095
What are you saying?

373
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,496
It is Achuyuthan
went to the airport

374
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,730
Don't disclose this to anyone now

375
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:11,807
Sir, what is the matter?

376
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:15,470
Let all programmes be cancelled..

377
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:18,281
You turn the car back to Ernakulam

378
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,185
Where is lG Chandradas?

379
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:25,381
IG and the Home Secretary
are in Cochin only, sir

380
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:39,892
-Sir!
-What happened?

381
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:42,131
Flight landed at 10.45

382
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,537
As perthe Driver, Meenakshi

383
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:46,743
was kidnapped at the airport
when she was entering the car

384
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:50,076
They throw him out of the car

385
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,809
He says he can identify them

386
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:54,885
Tell me.
I will..

387
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,988
Do you think I would
swallow what you say?

388
00:30:58,089 --> 00:30:59,283
Sir, I am telling the truth

389
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:00,322
Tell the truth..

390
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:05,893
Don't shout!

391
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:07,155
Uncle..

392
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,667
Start the vehicle

393
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:17,396
Uncle..

394
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:20,043
-Tell me
-Oh God!

395
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:23,146
-Tell me. -What's happening?
What is this man?

396
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,910
He is my chauffeurfor the last 30 years
I trust him

397
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:28,308
Achuta, you go inside

398
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:31,480
Sir, a call came some 10 minutes before

399
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:33,079
It was attended by ma'm

400
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:38,324
Oh.. Our daughter..

401
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:39,528
What did they say?

402
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:43,226
They said she is safe at their end

403
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:44,631
Phone then got disconnected

404
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:51,136
-Have you traced the call?
-Already directed..

405
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,550
All calls to this number
should be traced

406
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,445
The call madam attended was from Calcutta

407
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:06,113
From Calcutta?

408
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:16,933
No. I shall attend

409
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:23,140
Just to enquire that you reached..

410
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:24,173
Where is my daughter?

411
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,640
She is safe at my end

412
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:26,899
What do you want?

413
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:28,171
I'll inform you

414
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:32,841
But don't put her life in danger
by discussing with police

415
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:39,353
Sir, shall we take it to Calcutta police

416
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,322
No need for that

417
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:44,953
The media is waiting to get something

418
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:54,672
Sirthe call which came
now was from Mumbai

419
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:59,104
These groups are very
common in Nortern lndia

420
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:00,542
They demand ransom

421
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,203
We may have to give it

422
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:06,076
If they come to know about the moves
of police, that cause danger

423
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:07,515
You don't want the
police to investigate?

424
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:12,214
Not that. But investigation only after
she reaches our hands safely.

425
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:25,093
Now we want ten m illion in cash.

426
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:29,395
I would intimate how, when
and where to hand it over

427
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:34,974
How can I arrange
this much money?

428
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:36,671
Do you think we pay a dime?

429
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:38,476
That is the problem with police.

430
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:42,211
The efficiency of police should not be
proved at the cost of the life of a girl.

431
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,481
Sir, you need not bother about money.

432
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:46,353
I'll manage that.

433
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:56,127
This is an opportunity provided by God.

434
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:59,169
You know Home Minister
Sudharkaran sirwill not fall for money.

435
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:03,434
Your title deed issue
can be easily solved if he

436
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:06,408
recommends to the Revenue Minister.

437
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:11,576
Your father doesn't mind spending some
20 to 30 millions for the title deed.

438
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:16,176
You don't create problems
at this moment.

439
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:17,515
Let me call Thampi Sir..

440
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:22,393
Sir, I am Purushothaman.

441
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:25,155
Just to remind you of that title deed.

442
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:37,500
Greetings!

443
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:44,740
30 million..

444
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,714
-I haven't asked forthat much.
-lf needed..

445
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,184
Let it remain.

446
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,447
We can give it back,
if it is not needed.

447
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:54,787
Sir, you don't know Mr. Thampi.
He is a nice man.

448
00:34:54,892 --> 00:35:00,262
A 'poor' millionaire always
around to help others.

449
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:02,423
-I take leave of you
-Ok

450
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,697
I see him off..

451
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:07,534
What about my property title deed?

452
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:12,632
Don't worry. I'll manage that.
But now the priority is to save the girl

453
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:18,376
But how can you go like this?
What about my commission 3%

454
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:20,849
I have not got anything..
In fact I gave money..

455
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,921
But we get commission when
minister takes money

456
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:26,389
-I don't mind giving you the share.
-That's enough

457
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:31,254
You take a frontal role with minister

458
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:33,557
This relation is very important
for us in future..

459
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:36,166
Do you understand?
Take the vehicle

460
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:42,167
Is there any surety that we get
herfree by paying ransom?

461
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:43,535
What if they ask for more?

462
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,700
We can't be sure

463
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:49,337
It depends upon the capacity of
the person who deals with it

464
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:55,681
A person who has thorough understanding
of such groups in Mumbai and Calcutta..

465
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,721
I know of a person who dealt with
a similar situation when it happened

466
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:00,721
to the Defense Minister in Delhi

467
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:02,655
That operation was
with the knowledge of police.

468
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,320
I was secretary to defense minister then.

469
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:07,326
He is not a local goon.

470
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:10,559
Neither a criminal nor an underworld don!

471
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:14,293
But he can solve things above them.

472
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:18,569
As per police
he is a highly paid informer.

473
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:21,804
I have connections with him.
Also, I trust him.

474
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:26,211
-What do you say?
-I agree with Home secretary.

475
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:30,981
But I doubt if there was any such
operation in south lndia in the past.

476
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:32,847
Whom do you confide in?

477
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:35,721
He got a nick name in Mumbai underworld.

478
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:37,251
'Sher son'

479
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:41,197
Son of a lion.

480
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:00,583
His original name is Christy.

481
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:02,920
Christy Varghese Mopila.

482
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:14,660
Among North lndian friends
he is called madrasi mopila.

483
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:19,068
Who is there?

484
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:26,542
You..

485
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:29,810
Tell me who you are?

486
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:32,473
Me..
Asking who am l..?

487
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:36,314
Every Minister, every police officer
in Kerala knows me..

488
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,887
Still you don't me sir?

489
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:41,948
Sir, he is the cook here.

490
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:43,048
Why did you hide and look there?

491
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:46,854
I couldn't stop looking when
I heard that a cub is coming.

492
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:50,525
Sir, I have only heard about
"underworld king".

493
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:52,466
I am longing to see him.

494
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:54,401
When can I see him sir..

495
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:55,369
Stupid.. go inside..

496
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:13,550
-What did he say?
-He is not interested in Kerala.

497
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:15,414
Don't worry sir..

498
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:17,357
I will make them speak to him from Delhi.

499
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:20,655
He will oblige once the
Defense Minister talks to him.

500
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:26,431
Anyway, let's arrange for three business
class airtickets, Mumbai-Cochin.

501
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,435
A Merc should wait
for them at the airport..

502
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,974
Minister Devlal patel is very close to me.

503
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:39,440
I came only because of him.

504
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:45,913
Home Minister Sudhakaran.

505
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,781
Asst. Commissioner Hariharan Thampy.

506
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,695
Sir..!

507
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:00,496
-Achu brother, please hold this.
-No

508
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:02,623
Oh my lord Ayyappa!

509
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:05,258
Shall I take a bite from you?

510
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:09,939
-Bless me. -What is this?
-I am a unique kind of guy. -Get up!

511
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:13,939
Inspired by underworld films, I left

512
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:15,511
home to become an underworld king.

513
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:17,513
Now I am the 'king of the kitchen' here.

514
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:18,809
-Kindly bless me sir.
-Stupid,.. go inside.

515
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,282
Look!..
Don't pull me away

516
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:23,850
Sorry. Come in

517
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:25,787
Is he gone?

518
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:35,162
What are their demands?

519
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:36,727
10 million..

520
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,799
-Do you have the money?
-I have it.

521
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:41,094
-How much?
-Same 10 million

522
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:43,636
That's not enough!

523
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:46,666
It should me 21 million rather

524
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:50,714
10 to them.. 11 to me!

525
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:56,217
My fees is more that the ransom

526
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,050
Remember you are bargaining
with a minister..

527
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:00,680
No..No.. I mean a bridge between us.

528
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:04,352
No bridging.. I am not in the habit of
keeping such emotions in this profession.

529
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:09,189
Sir, life of our girl is
most important now.

530
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:13,565
Can't you save herwithout paying ransom?

531
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:15,027
What is this..sir?

532
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,232
Those who work should get
compensation, shouldn't they?

533
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:21,037
Do you know where the kidnappers are?
How well do you plan?

534
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:24,012
First call to this landline
is from Calcutta;

535
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:27,049
second from Mumbai;
And the third call from Delhi.

536
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,847
That too in just four hrs.

537
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:34,216
It is not possible for them to shuttle
between these places within such time.

538
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,190
So they haven't left Kerala.

539
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,988
Leave the rest to me

540
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:54,075
Where?

541
00:41:57,648 --> 00:42:00,845
We should wait for them at
2nd No. crane of the shipyard.

542
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:02,248
His agent would come there.

543
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:03,944
Now it is easy!

544
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:07,046
Any fool can reach his hideout
by following the agent.

545
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:09,353
What's your name brother?

546
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:11,953
Hariharan Thumpy

547
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:13,886
No. I am Thampy.

548
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:22,065
You policemen are the real fools
who think that criminals are fools.

549
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:24,630
We don't have an lPS but in this game

550
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:28,007
we are lCS- lndian Criminal Service.

551
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:30,137
It's not awarded by the Academy
of Administration Mussourie

552
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:32,078
but by the Underworld.

553
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:34,912
So don't be a fool..Okay!

554
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:46,053
If you play the police tactics to
follow or to take control of me,

555
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:47,893
then I'll stab you in the chest.

556
00:42:47,998 --> 00:42:51,195
Then there is no benefit other
than to enquire whether the

557
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:53,270
knife is 'S' shaped or 'T' shaped.

558
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:55,769
Ranjith, take that land-phone.

559
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:03,405
Give the cash.

560
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:18,394
See his show in front of the
home Minister of the state..

561
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:20,087
Now ball is in his court

562
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:22,097
But the moment I get my daughter

563
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:25,134
freed I'll show him who is a
minister and what is police

564
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:23,021
That Scorpio which you see
belongs to my team

565
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:25,828
But they are just there to watch you

566
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:28,126
My agent would come via the sea route

567
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:32,667
You handover the cash to him
I will make a call one hour after

568
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:35,972
Till such time you should not
make a move from there

569
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,214
Near Vypin!

570
00:46:15,038 --> 00:46:18,269
You told me there is no
money with your dad?

571
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:20,002
See now what happened!

572
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,975
This is 10 million!

573
00:46:23,046 --> 00:46:24,206
You got the money..

574
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:26,210
Now you make me reach home

575
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:28,180
How can I leave you like that?

576
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:30,186
When Jesus showed us a way,

577
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:31,982
we should not reject that..

578
00:46:38,762 --> 00:46:39,694
Got the money

579
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:42,527
-What about the girl?
-My demands are not yet over

580
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,058
This is cheating..

581
00:46:56,547 --> 00:46:59,778
George.. George Kutty!

582
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:06,813
Let me also see!

583
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,053
-Greetings!
-Please come..

584
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,148
He is the guy

585
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:13,095
A stylish guy, isn't brother?

586
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:15,456
-What is your name, son?
-George Kutty

587
00:47:15,566 --> 00:47:19,468
He is into spare parts business
Living in Mumbai for the last 7-8 years

588
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:21,663
He has own flat and car there

589
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:24,570
He has very few relatives here

590
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:27,735
I am his uncle. She is my wife

591
00:47:28,745 --> 00:47:31,805
-My father died 25 years back
-I know

592
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:34,843
I decided on this proposal,
when I heard that you are son

593
00:47:35,118 --> 00:47:37,313
of an army man who laid down
his life for the country

594
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:38,752
How many children you have?

595
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,619
Varghese Mopila has four children

596
00:47:40,724 --> 00:47:42,282
Two sons and two daughters..

597
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:44,622
-He is elder son Christy
-Greetings!

598
00:47:44,728 --> 00:47:46,161
Working in South lndian Bank

599
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:48,497
Where is Joji?

600
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:50,758
I am here only

601
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:53,426
We got him after prayers and offerings

602
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:55,129
He is enrolled in seminary
ordained to the priesthood.

603
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:56,729
A priest in a family!

604
00:47:56,807 --> 00:47:59,071
It's matter of pride.

605
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:02,541
Easier said than done..

606
00:48:02,646 --> 00:48:04,739
Christy.. call her.

607
00:48:05,482 --> 00:48:07,109
Don't go alone
I'll also come with you

608
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:12,482
Looks very stylish!

609
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:14,279
-You tell.
-You tell, brother

610
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:16,154
-You tell.
-You tell, brother

611
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:18,283
You are wearing enough makeup.

612
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:20,420
If you look more beautiful,
this proposal may not work.

613
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:21,394
Why?

614
00:48:22,266 --> 00:48:23,631
There would be a mismatch.

615
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:24,860
You see him?

616
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:26,800
Yeah. You tell about him..

617
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,303
You tell about him..

618
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:32,136
One eye is squint..

619
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:33,334
Baldheaded..

620
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:35,843
Blackened but reddened lips..

621
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:38,278
He is lame- legged too.

622
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:40,282
Brother, is it by polio or accident?

623
00:48:40,384 --> 00:48:42,284
He lost an ear in that accident.

624
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:43,853
-ls it?
-Yes!

625
00:48:43,954 --> 00:48:47,287
Anyway he is immensely rich.
That is why dad agreed him.

626
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:50,258
You don't worry, dear!
Fate will have its course

627
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:53,693
-You come.
-Brother, don't be like a child

628
00:48:56,366 --> 00:48:58,596
He is my brother, Kochu Thoma.

629
00:48:58,702 --> 00:48:59,760
Village Officer..

630
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:04,964
He brought up my four motherless

631
00:49:05,242 --> 00:49:06,903
children while I was in Military.
He even forgot to marry.

632
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:09,340
Go and bring the tea

633
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:11,212
Come on..

634
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:14,580
-Go there
-Go

635
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:19,352
Look!

636
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:23,381
Look..

637
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:26,653
Look at the groom carefully

638
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:49,752
Whilst in love

639
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:51,377
Let any girl be

640
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,217
She is cat like

641
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:57,953
And empties the milk pot
Slowly and slowly!

642
00:49:58,061 --> 00:49:59,653
Whilst in love

643
00:49:59,763 --> 00:50:01,287
Let any girl be

644
00:50:01,398 --> 00:50:02,990
She is cat like

645
00:50:03,266 --> 00:50:08,636
And empties the milk pot
Slowly and slowly!

646
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:09,865
Shyness in her eyes,

647
00:50:09,973 --> 00:50:11,031
Shyness in voice

648
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:13,276
And shyness altogether

649
00:50:13,377 --> 00:50:14,844
Shy be in her strides

650
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:15,934
shy be in her stance

651
00:50:16,046 --> 00:50:17,877
And shy be altogether.

652
00:50:17,981 --> 00:50:22,850
In the fragrant moonlight
There is shower of flowers

653
00:50:22,953 --> 00:50:27,788
And the night so flicking
and love-laden.

654
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:33,022
And this the moment of blissfulness

655
00:50:33,296 --> 00:50:34,388
Whilst in love

656
00:50:34,498 --> 00:50:35,931
Let any girl be

657
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,728
She is cat like

658
00:50:37,834 --> 00:50:43,329
And empties the milk pot
Slowly and slowly!

659
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,566
Shyness in her eyes,

660
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:45,834
Shyness in voice

661
00:50:45,942 --> 00:50:47,967
And shyness altogether

662
00:50:48,078 --> 00:50:49,568
Shy be in her strides

663
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:50,668
shy be in her stance

664
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:52,749
And shy be altogether.

665
00:51:22,646 --> 00:51:24,807
And now, it's not me, not me, not me

666
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:27,645
Feigns an air of hesitation,

667
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:29,844
Then you come with me
You come with me..

668
00:51:29,953 --> 00:51:32,581
Then can you attach my love.

669
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:34,054
Thou my dream,

670
00:51:34,157 --> 00:51:35,419
Thou my naughty

671
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:37,550
Thus fondle the whole lot.

672
00:51:37,661 --> 00:51:42,792
And will take her
And make her walk my side!

673
00:51:42,899 --> 00:51:45,629
This sweetness is not enough

674
00:51:45,735 --> 00:51:47,965
Not sweet enough
for the honeymoon

675
00:51:48,071 --> 00:51:52,030
And so let me sing a song now..

676
00:51:52,142 --> 00:51:57,011
The song that fills in heart.

677
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:58,638
Whilst in love..

678
00:51:58,748 --> 00:52:00,045
Let any girl be

679
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:01,811
She is cat like

680
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:07,517
And empties the milk pot
Slowly and slowly!

681
00:52:07,657 --> 00:52:08,783
Shyness in her eyes,

682
00:52:08,892 --> 00:52:09,881
Shyness in voice

683
00:52:09,993 --> 00:52:12,086
And shyness altogether

684
00:52:12,195 --> 00:52:13,685
Shy be in her strides

685
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:14,923
shy be in her stance

686
00:52:15,031 --> 00:52:16,658
And shy be altogether.

687
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:51,698
I saw everybody Ei
And now on to feel that

688
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:56,532
I am everything
And then will light up

689
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:59,368
The feel that I am to go with her
Further shall I flirt with her

690
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:01,773
That you are mine, you are gracious!

691
00:53:01,878 --> 00:53:07,145
He will then melt down in her
And will be her moonlight of love

692
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:09,810
Whither.. whither art thou sweet heart

693
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,184
Tell me whither, art thou sweet song

694
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:16,248
Would you sing the song you penned

695
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:21,156
Your song-the song that fills my heart.

696
00:53:21,264 --> 00:53:22,754
Whilst in love

697
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:24,265
Let any girl be

698
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,126
She is cat like

699
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:31,036
And empties the milk pot
Slowly and slowly!

700
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:36,010
In the fragrant moonlight
There is shower of flowers

701
00:53:36,112 --> 00:53:41,049
And the night so flicking
and love-laden.

702
00:53:41,151 --> 00:53:46,088
And this the moment of blissfulness

703
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:47,588
Whilst in love

704
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:49,090
Let any girl be

705
00:53:49,192 --> 00:53:50,955
She is cat like

706
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:55,930
And empties the milk pot
Slowly and slowly!

707
00:53:56,032 --> 00:53:57,522
Whilst in love..

708
00:53:57,667 --> 00:53:59,032
Let any girl be

709
00:53:59,135 --> 00:54:00,762
She is cat like

710
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:06,137
And empties the milk pot
Slowly and slowly!

711
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:07,232
Whilst in love

712
00:54:07,344 --> 00:54:09,005
Let any girl be

713
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,944
She is cat like

714
00:54:11,047 --> 00:54:16,576
And empties the milk pot
Slowly and slowly!

715
00:54:19,723 --> 00:54:22,658
I was very glad that you are prom oted.

716
00:54:23,126 --> 00:54:25,856
But this journey to Mum bai could

717
00:54:27,897 --> 00:54:31,162
have been avoided had you
declined the promotion. Isn't it Thomas?

718
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:34,630
He is unable to be separated from you.
That's the reason.

719
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:37,673
An army man should not be
disappointed over silly matters.

720
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:40,766
I can come back here as a
Branch Manager in two years.

721
00:54:40,877 --> 00:54:46,008
See brother, she has packed up all
the utensils and stuff for Mumbai.

722
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:48,346
These are necessary things only.

723
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:49,611
What is this for?

724
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:51,687
I am going to stay in Jessy's flat
till I get my accommodation.

725
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:53,983
Brother, these are for Jessy only.

726
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:55,955
You get in.
Otherwise you would miss train.

727
00:54:56,026 --> 00:54:57,891
-Dad!
-See you, dear

728
00:54:58,328 --> 00:55:00,853
Brother, there is enough time
for you to meet Sophie.

729
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:03,228
-No.. Dad did not hear..
-I heard!

730
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,269
I wish you be the sacristan
at theirwedding.

731
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:11,238
It is your wishes and offerings..

732
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:14,640
..that made me a votive cock.

733
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:22,713
Brother, Mumbai is the place of
red street and discotheques

734
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:24,013
Control Yourself..

735
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,314
Be a man, ok.

736
00:55:25,422 --> 00:55:27,447
But how come you know about red street.

737
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:32,222
In seminary, we were taught
not to go the evil ways..

738
00:55:32,362 --> 00:55:35,354
What is it?
Go away

739
00:55:50,947 --> 00:55:51,936
Will you come to Chembur?

740
00:55:55,919 --> 00:55:57,113
You came earliertoday.

741
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:58,209
Today is Saturday.

742
00:55:58,321 --> 00:55:59,310
I forgot it

743
00:56:00,256 --> 00:56:03,123
I have arranged a flat for you in Andheri.
Will get its key on Monday.

744
00:56:03,226 --> 00:56:05,126
That's good.
It's easy to go back and forth.

745
00:56:05,228 --> 00:56:06,923
Train journey is very difficult.

746
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,224
Mumbai got me bored
in just two weeks.

747
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:11,789
Once you get used to,
you would not leave Mumbai.

748
00:56:15,505 --> 00:56:16,904
Why are you looking dull?

749
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:20,502
Are you not well?

750
00:56:21,077 --> 00:56:22,009
No. Nothing

751
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:23,704
I am observing you from
the day I am here.

752
00:56:23,813 --> 00:56:25,110
You have changed a lot.

753
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,740
Your smart, lively and
jovial mood is lost.

754
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:29,511
No. You just feel like that only.

755
00:56:29,786 --> 00:56:30,980
Christy is right.

756
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:32,782
She is like this from the
very first day itself.

757
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:36,416
Being away from home changes people.

758
00:56:36,526 --> 00:56:39,086
I asked her to bring Stella here.

759
00:56:39,195 --> 00:56:40,059
That's not required.

760
00:56:43,099 --> 00:56:46,967
Hey don't be upset.
Tomorrow is Sunday.

761
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:50,897
We can go for an outing.
The kitchen is shut for tomorrow.

762
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:57,539
You need to take her out like this.

763
00:56:58,047 --> 00:56:59,412
These are the only
funny moments in life.

764
00:56:59,516 --> 00:57:00,574
You don't know.

765
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:04,047
There is no place left here for us to go.

766
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:25,000
Start guys, the bird has come

767
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:42,116
He's escaping
Catch him

768
00:57:42,992 --> 00:57:44,619
Stop there

769
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:46,551
-Stop you, idiot!
-Brother!

770
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:49,295
You go back to the apartment.

771
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:01,136
How farwill he go?

772
00:58:21,898 --> 00:58:24,298
Khan Bhai.. Don't shoot..

773
00:58:25,902 --> 00:58:26,891
You idiot!

774
00:58:27,036 --> 00:58:30,437
Do you think you can live in..

775
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:33,065
..Mumbai cheating Karim Lala.?

776
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:38,238
Lalaji has ordered to bring you alive.

777
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:43,513
You will not sell off any
innocent girl after today.

778
00:58:44,287 --> 00:58:46,187
Catch that scoundrel..

779
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:14,448
You are destined to die for him.

780
00:59:17,086 --> 00:59:18,144
Don't do

781
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:30,664
Christy..
Let's escape..

782
00:59:30,767 --> 00:59:32,735
-George Kutty, what is this?
-Now there is no time to speak..

783
00:59:34,037 --> 00:59:36,005
We have done it for self protection.
We may tell police the facts.

784
00:59:36,105 --> 00:59:37,629
Then you tell them..

785
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,105
I'll come back with an attorney.

786
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:43,110
-Don't move.
-Surrender to us

787
00:59:50,186 --> 00:59:51,244
No. I did not.

788
00:59:56,593 --> 01:00:00,552
Yes, your brother is in jail
for the crime I committed.

789
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:03,758
Your brother should not remain
in Mumbai for my business.

790
01:00:05,335 --> 01:00:06,597
You are a cheat..

791
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:10,263
I couldn't tell the truth to even
my brother, in fear of you.

792
01:00:10,373 --> 01:00:12,341
-You..
-I will now tell the world

793
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:14,410
that you are a dirty pimp..

794
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:16,341
You even pimp your wife!

795
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:18,610
Let my father know about it.

796
01:00:18,715 --> 01:00:19,773
Stop

797
01:00:23,252 --> 01:00:24,549
Jessy.. I told you.

798
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:53,508
It is his bad company that
made Christy go astray.

799
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:56,344
I advised him quite a few times.

800
01:00:56,819 --> 01:01:00,311
It was a skirmish with some drug mafia.

801
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:02,817
They came in revenge.

802
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,092
At last I am the loser!

803
01:01:06,529 --> 01:01:07,655
I lost my Jessy.

804
01:01:10,133 --> 01:01:14,763
Why don't we arrange a
good lawyerfor brother?

805
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:15,803
For what..?

806
01:01:16,572 --> 01:01:18,836
-Let him pay for his sins.
-Brother, don't say like that.

807
01:01:18,941 --> 01:01:20,238
What should I say then?

808
01:01:20,943 --> 01:01:23,275
I lost my daughter because of him.

809
01:01:23,379 --> 01:01:24,812
I don't want to see him..

810
01:01:29,252 --> 01:01:32,380
I was remanded in
Mumbai Arthur Road Jail..

811
01:01:32,488 --> 01:01:36,822
Nobody from home turned up
for my legal support.

812
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:40,162
But one man came to see me in jail.

813
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:51,599
Karim Lala who was enemy
to George bailed me out.

814
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:02,776
Dad..

815
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:05,378
Brother..

816
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:11,816
-Dear!
-Brother..

817
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:16,163
Come in..

818
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:19,390
-Give it to me
-Where is Joji?

819
01:02:19,502 --> 01:02:20,628
Joji is in ltaly now.

820
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:21,965
He was sent by seminary.

821
01:02:27,343 --> 01:02:29,607
-Dad..
-Why did you come?

822
01:02:30,313 --> 01:02:33,373
We are yet to come
out of Jessy's demise.

823
01:02:33,483 --> 01:02:35,576
Do you want to torture us more?

824
01:02:35,685 --> 01:02:37,880
I am an accused in front of the court.

825
01:02:38,654 --> 01:02:43,250
But do you thinkyour
son can become a killer?

826
01:02:47,797 --> 01:02:51,289
He is the reason for everything.

827
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:54,261
-Leave him
-Don't believe him.

828
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:56,565
I make him speak the truth!

829
01:02:56,672 --> 01:02:59,232
Leave him.. You leave him..

830
01:02:59,575 --> 01:03:01,304
Don't show your
Mumbai hooliganism here.

831
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:02,843
Go away

832
01:03:02,979 --> 01:03:04,344
What do you want Christy?

833
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,506
If you want to frame me,
Then go ahead..

834
01:03:06,682 --> 01:03:07,740
-I'll take responsibility.
-Dad, he is..

835
01:03:07,850 --> 01:03:09,044
You hear what he said?

836
01:03:09,418 --> 01:03:11,386
Now onward he will be in
the status of my eldest son.

837
01:03:14,824 --> 01:03:16,257
Henceforth you
should not come here.

838
01:03:16,692 --> 01:03:20,458
My only dream left
now is her marriage.

839
01:03:20,897 --> 01:03:24,628
But many a proposal did not work
because of you criminal.

840
01:03:26,569 --> 01:03:28,400
I have never pleaded in
front of anyone in life.

841
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:30,833
But now I am doing that..

842
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:33,808
Please don't come to our place.

843
01:03:42,418 --> 01:03:46,650
You be careful of him, my sister.

844
01:03:50,426 --> 01:03:52,519
I am leaving you for now.

845
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:56,457
But Karim Lala is waiting foryou!

846
01:04:02,638 --> 01:04:04,538
The boat is nearVypin lsland.

847
01:04:04,907 --> 01:04:09,708
So she is being hidden
in some building there.

848
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:17,475
Leave me
Don't come near me..

849
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,873
-Come on
-Leave me

850
01:04:44,513 --> 01:04:46,606
Christy you hear what I say.

851
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:49,412
His fatherwould give whatever
money we want, for her release.

852
01:04:49,819 --> 01:04:50,945
We can bargain also.

853
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:52,884
You can also join me in this.

854
01:04:52,989 --> 01:04:53,978
We can share the booty.

855
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:55,387
Both the girl and the money!

856
01:05:00,096 --> 01:05:03,463
Kill me if you can..
Kill me..

857
01:05:05,768 --> 01:05:06,792
No you cannot..

858
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:10,862
If you kill me, you will have to answer
your fatherthroughout the life.

859
01:05:10,973 --> 01:05:14,431
Even if I kill you, one day my
fatherwill understand me

860
01:05:14,610 --> 01:05:18,944
But I offered your life to Karim Lala..

861
01:05:19,048 --> 01:05:22,745
Karim Lala would not even
get a glimpse of me.

862
01:07:19,602 --> 01:07:20,364
Don't be afraid..

863
01:07:21,203 --> 01:07:23,228
I have been sent by yourfather.

864
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:39,610
Rocky, you guys go to airport and
book tickets on the last flight.

865
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:41,747
I'll reach airport after
dropping her home.

866
01:08:13,456 --> 01:08:16,016
-Dad..
-Viji, our daughter has come

867
01:08:16,459 --> 01:08:18,086
Dear

868
01:08:18,661 --> 01:08:20,288
Mom..

869
01:08:28,737 --> 01:08:30,967
-Thanks for everything.
-Sir, I am going back now.

870
01:08:31,073 --> 01:08:33,041
My team is waiting in the airport.

871
01:08:33,142 --> 01:08:34,769
Please ask someone to drop me there.

872
01:08:34,877 --> 01:08:38,142
Achuta, you drop sir at the airport.

873
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:39,144
Ok, sir

874
01:08:40,649 --> 01:08:41,479
Come, dear!

875
01:08:43,719 --> 01:08:45,949
-May I come with you sir..
-Where?

876
01:08:46,021 --> 01:08:47,079
To the underworld..

877
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:49,214
I know how to stab and hack.

878
01:08:50,893 --> 01:08:52,793
This knife has seen lot of blood!

879
01:08:52,895 --> 01:08:53,953
But of fish and chicken only..

880
01:08:55,097 --> 01:08:58,225
You just make me an underworld
king like Dawood or Chota Rajan.

881
01:08:58,334 --> 01:09:00,859
I would live by that.

882
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:04,237
Now the underworld is far
behind these real world kings.

883
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:07,707
Don't you see the minister
making millions in no time?

884
01:09:07,843 --> 01:09:09,003
So you go better to him.

885
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:13,946
Is it?
Sir, don't go

886
01:09:14,049 --> 01:09:17,109
-What for?
-Sir, I'll come tomorrow.

887
01:09:17,219 --> 01:09:18,379
-What for?
-Let me start studying from you..

888
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:19,476
Go you stupid..

889
01:09:36,272 --> 01:09:38,797
You brought the minister's
daughter safe, aren't you?

890
01:09:39,141 --> 01:09:39,971
Congrats

891
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:43,335
-But a small problem..
-Who?

892
01:09:43,445 --> 01:09:45,970
That kidnapper George Kutty was killed.

893
01:09:54,323 --> 01:09:56,951
Somebody from George's
team has informed the police.

894
01:09:57,226 --> 01:10:00,161
He has tendered evidence that you
were the last one to meet him.

895
01:10:00,829 --> 01:10:02,922
There is no issue since this
is a case involving minister.

896
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:05,466
You may come with me for legal
formalities and also just to

897
01:10:05,568 --> 01:10:07,468
convince the media persons.
Come by this car..

898
01:10:25,154 --> 01:10:28,021
The body should be handed over
to relatives after the postmortem.

899
01:10:28,123 --> 01:10:30,421
-ls there any relative?
-Yes. An old man came.

900
01:10:30,526 --> 01:10:32,323
He is saying that he is the
father of the dead man.

901
01:11:03,392 --> 01:11:05,860
At last you killed our George Kutty.

902
01:11:06,629 --> 01:11:11,225
-Dad..
-You will stab me also in the chest

903
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:13,563
as there is no loathing in you
towards killing and bloodshed.

904
01:11:13,669 --> 01:11:14,601
You are right.

905
01:11:15,904 --> 01:11:19,567
The duel between Christy and the
killed George started out in Mumbai.

906
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:22,301
Even a life sentence on that..

907
01:11:22,645 --> 01:11:25,273
When Christy came out of jail,
George left Mumbai.

908
01:11:25,614 --> 01:11:28,048
You waited for the right opportunity
and now finished him off.

909
01:11:28,150 --> 01:11:29,139
Don't talk rubbish!

910
01:11:29,251 --> 01:11:30,912
What for you came from Mumbai then?

911
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:32,920
Whetherto kill this old man..

912
01:11:43,732 --> 01:11:44,892
Here you walk man!

913
01:11:47,236 --> 01:11:52,367
In my first sight itself, I saw a
glare of deceit in your eyes!

914
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:57,343
If you show me bastardly attitude..

915
01:11:57,446 --> 01:11:58,970
Throw him into the vehicle.

916
01:12:23,205 --> 01:12:24,433
Let's take him to police camp.

917
01:12:25,207 --> 01:12:26,504
Questioning can be done there.

918
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:29,174
We can produce him in court afterthat.

919
01:12:29,645 --> 01:12:31,545
Our search is still on
for his two accomplices

920
01:12:31,647 --> 01:12:33,239
They may have just escaped.

921
01:12:35,417 --> 01:12:36,406
Take the vehicle..

922
01:12:43,492 --> 01:12:44,481
Stop it

923
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:47,128
Stop jangar there.

924
01:12:51,433 --> 01:12:52,730
You hold him at gunpoint.

925
01:13:31,774 --> 01:13:33,173
What did you think of me?

926
01:13:33,275 --> 01:13:39,305
A few policeman and a stupid lPS
officer like you hardly can stop me.

927
01:13:39,681 --> 01:13:43,845
My playing ground is Mumbai
where blood smelt on breeze.

928
01:13:44,186 --> 01:13:47,519
I have seen several officers
like you there.

929
01:13:47,689 --> 01:13:50,089
And I played the police and
thief games with them.

930
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:51,518
Give it

931
01:13:51,627 --> 01:13:54,152
Don't bother to send your
police to the other end.

932
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:55,560
My route is different.

933
01:13:55,764 --> 01:13:57,197
See this..

934
01:13:58,367 --> 01:13:59,800
It's for my journey.

935
01:14:03,906 --> 01:14:06,170
Now I will teach you
how to play game.

936
01:14:06,508 --> 01:14:09,170
That too without taking
the fees of a coach.

937
01:14:09,244 --> 01:14:11,337
I would leave Kochi only afterthat.

938
01:14:26,395 --> 01:14:30,229
I was shocked to hearthat he is son

939
01:14:30,332 --> 01:14:31,526
of Palamattom Capt. Varghese Mopila.

940
01:14:31,667 --> 01:14:34,659
That's why I framed him in the murder

941
01:14:34,770 --> 01:14:38,297
case and told minister that the kidnapping

942
01:14:38,407 --> 01:14:40,307
was a drama stage managed by
Christy and George together.

943
01:14:40,409 --> 01:14:42,707
Now Christy is a lifelong foe
of the Minister.

944
01:14:42,811 --> 01:14:45,871
Even if it is not shown openly every

945
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:46,913
father has a soft corner
about his children.

946
01:14:47,182 --> 01:14:48,649
If Christy was in your custody,

947
01:14:48,784 --> 01:14:50,911
Varghese Mopila would have
definitely come pleading before us.

948
01:14:51,186 --> 01:14:54,519
Yes.. Yes.. With that documents of title
deeds given by Thomas.

949
01:14:54,623 --> 01:14:57,615
How do we get him again?
He might have escaped..

950
01:15:00,362 --> 01:15:01,920
He is boorish in nature.

951
01:15:02,264 --> 01:15:03,561
He would not go without hitting us.

952
01:15:03,665 --> 01:15:07,260
If he is not arrested, you'll in trouble.

953
01:15:08,937 --> 01:15:11,337
What are you thinking?

954
01:15:11,807 --> 01:15:13,604
It's about removing thorn by a thorn.

955
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:17,670
A goon to take on another!

956
01:15:32,327 --> 01:15:33,453
Who are you?

957
01:15:34,329 --> 01:15:35,387
I am Mathai..

958
01:15:35,998 --> 01:15:39,456
Friend of your son-in-law George Kutty.

959
01:15:39,568 --> 01:15:41,968
Not just a friend: a big friend.

960
01:15:42,404 --> 01:15:46,272
I want to see your son
who killed George Kutty.

961
01:15:46,475 --> 01:15:48,966
Wherever he is,
I'll hunt him down.

962
01:15:49,244 --> 01:15:50,233
You get out..

963
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:52,970
See this knife, Mopila.

964
01:15:53,248 --> 01:15:55,682
This is for piercing your son's heart.

965
01:15:56,585 --> 01:15:59,748
Give him the sacrament of the dying..

966
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:01,647
I will be here only.

967
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:05,949
I'll go to Mumbai only
afterfinishing him off.

968
01:16:10,732 --> 01:16:15,931
I don't know if he had any
friend named Mathai?

969
01:16:17,839 --> 01:16:22,833
Anyway, I want to find out him
who have challenged my father.

970
01:16:23,445 --> 01:16:24,969
I want to meet him.

971
01:16:30,285 --> 01:16:32,515
-Already he has..
-Match box please..

972
01:16:34,489 --> 01:16:36,787
-You are George Kutty's friend..
Am I right? -Yes

973
01:16:36,892 --> 01:16:38,860
Shall we settle our accounts?

974
01:16:41,697 --> 01:16:44,689
Who are you to settle the accounts?

975
01:16:44,833 --> 01:16:46,926
Where is Christy?

976
01:17:15,397 --> 01:17:16,523
I am Christy.

977
01:17:17,099 --> 01:17:19,624
I am sure you are not
George Kutty's friend.

978
01:17:20,135 --> 01:17:21,966
If you are born male, hit me!

979
01:18:53,128 --> 01:18:54,060
Give it to me

980
01:19:21,256 --> 01:19:23,986
He has got a nick name 'goon'
in the department.

981
01:19:24,059 --> 01:19:26,050
Yes.. he is a goon but a police goon!

982
01:19:26,528 --> 01:19:29,725
If asked to bring someone alive,
he brings him dead!

983
01:19:29,898 --> 01:19:32,628
We were batch-mates in Mussoorie.

984
01:19:37,072 --> 01:19:40,838
He is not like the fragile lPS
officers you saw in Mumbai.

985
01:19:41,076 --> 01:19:44,534
In Kerala Police we have some
highly venomous types also!

986
01:19:45,213 --> 01:19:46,612
What to do sir?

987
01:19:46,715 --> 01:19:52,119
The boys who could beat these venomous
types to death, were hitherto in Mumbai.

988
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:56,620
You dirty..
What would you do if you were here?

989
01:19:59,127 --> 01:20:04,064
You don't frighten me with that
fifteen year old service revolver.

990
01:20:05,066 --> 01:20:11,596
With these hands, I use special
weapons shipped from lsrael!

991
01:20:14,242 --> 01:20:18,235
Don't beat drum in front of fireworks.

992
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:22,714
-I have no fear..
-I will make you fear!

993
01:20:36,765 --> 01:20:37,754
Dad..

994
01:20:37,866 --> 01:20:40,960
I told you that Varghese Mopila would
come to try his hands on son's bail out.

995
01:20:41,069 --> 01:20:43,264
Then let me talk to him.

996
01:20:44,406 --> 01:20:46,931
Varghese Mopila..
Please don't misunderstand me.

997
01:20:47,075 --> 01:20:49,908
If we don't help each other what
is the point in saying that we

998
01:20:50,045 --> 01:20:51,842
belong to the same village.

999
01:20:51,947 --> 01:20:54,279
I'll help you get your son out of jail.

1000
01:20:54,382 --> 01:20:56,407
My son is the city police commissioner.

1001
01:20:56,685 --> 01:20:57,674
You steer clear of my way.

1002
01:20:57,853 --> 01:20:59,320
-Why are saying like this?
-Move away..

1003
01:21:16,071 --> 01:21:20,167
Congrats for locking up a killer!

1004
01:21:23,411 --> 01:21:24,901
But that's not enough..

1005
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:29,048
You kept me at knifepoint in
my shop the other day.

1006
01:21:29,150 --> 01:21:32,085
I want you to show the same
vigor to get him the punishment.

1007
01:21:32,954 --> 01:21:35,889
Maximum punishment permitted by law..

1008
01:21:40,061 --> 01:21:41,722
I came here to say this.

1009
01:21:49,971 --> 01:21:51,131
Bring him inside..

1010
01:21:58,113 --> 01:21:59,171
Bharathan, you may go..

1011
01:22:00,882 --> 01:22:05,751
Did you hearwhat Capt. Mopila said?

1012
01:22:06,187 --> 01:22:10,351
Seeking maximum punishment for his son!

1013
01:22:11,826 --> 01:22:15,762
But Varghese Mopila doesn't
know about his son's innocence.

1014
01:22:16,331 --> 01:22:19,459
Anyway sir, law insists that an
arrested person should be produced

1015
01:22:19,734 --> 01:22:21,099
before court in 24 hours.

1016
01:22:21,269 --> 01:22:23,863
Will the court come to me
for serving punishment?

1017
01:22:23,972 --> 01:22:27,305
You mean to say that
you will get easy bail.

1018
01:22:29,811 --> 01:22:32,712
You need not expect the court
which considers your FlR to grant

1019
01:22:32,814 --> 01:22:36,944
you bail or release you unconditionally.

1020
01:22:37,118 --> 01:22:41,851
If police decide to go after you,
there is no use even getting the

1021
01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:44,221
best lawyerto appear foryou.
A life imprisonment is sure.

1022
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:46,157
Oh.. sir I have an offering that

1023
01:22:46,261 --> 01:22:51,460
I will surrender only before a court
which serves me capital punishment.

1024
01:22:51,833 --> 01:22:55,792
Vadakkan may not have the vim
and vigor to take me inside court.

1025
01:22:55,971 --> 01:22:57,029
I'll jump your custody.

1026
01:22:57,305 --> 01:22:58,966
I'll jump while on the
way to the court itself.

1027
01:22:59,574 --> 01:23:02,008
For that, Vadakkan should go wayward.

1028
01:23:02,277 --> 01:23:04,245
Anywhere you go, I'll jump.

1029
01:23:05,146 --> 01:23:07,011
Ifyou are courteous,
I am also ok.

1030
01:23:07,115 --> 01:23:08,173
Otherwise I am a different person.

1031
01:23:08,283 --> 01:23:09,341
I'll jump.

1032
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:11,479
Are you challenging me?

1033
01:23:11,586 --> 01:23:15,147
I'll jump.

1034
01:23:16,458 --> 01:23:20,827
I'll definitely jump your custody.

1035
01:24:04,072 --> 01:24:06,370
DlG lssac John spoke
to me from Mumbai.

1036
01:24:10,011 --> 01:24:11,205
He is inside the cell.

1037
01:24:11,446 --> 01:24:15,212
DlG told me about the gang wars
between Andrews and Christy.

1038
01:24:19,587 --> 01:24:21,350
This is not your Mumbai but Cochin.

1039
01:24:21,456 --> 01:24:23,617
Even a scratch on Christy's body is
unthinkable inside the station.

1040
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:44,174
Sherson, you escaped from my
gunpoint not once but thrice.

1041
01:24:44,512 --> 01:24:48,414
Now I came pointing in,
the lion is trapped inside the cage.

1042
01:24:48,516 --> 01:24:51,644
That too inside a safe cage
with police security.

1043
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:54,520
You cannot do anything to me here, sir.

1044
01:24:54,589 --> 01:24:56,580
Kerala police will have to answer.

1045
01:24:57,592 --> 01:24:59,184
Harihar, your job will be lost.

1046
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:05,293
Andrews, you can settle our
scores there in Mumbai.

1047
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:09,632
I will bury you in Cochin
where you had born.

1048
01:25:10,505 --> 01:25:11,631
Within no time..

1049
01:25:27,522 --> 01:25:29,114
How much money is needed

1050
01:25:29,524 --> 01:25:31,185
for you to get him outside?

1051
01:25:34,028 --> 01:25:36,519
Joseph Vadakkan is handling this case.
Not me..

1052
01:25:57,218 --> 01:25:58,276
You can demand anything.

1053
01:26:00,522 --> 01:26:04,390
But tomorrow's newspaper
headlines should be this.

1054
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:10,628
"Christy Varghese who tried to break
jail was shot dead by Joseph Vadakkan."

1055
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:18,164
When I heard that some Andrews is
coming I thought he would bring

1056
01:26:18,306 --> 01:26:22,606
some evidence to nail Christy.

1057
01:26:22,710 --> 01:26:24,337
That's why I came here.

1058
01:26:26,147 --> 01:26:31,744
You might have seen such police officers
in Mumbai who wash your dirty linen

1059
01:26:31,853 --> 01:26:33,081
for a bag full of money.

1060
01:26:33,288 --> 01:26:34,220
But this is Joseph Vadakkan.

1061
01:26:34,322 --> 01:26:39,453
Whoever you are it is not wise
to antagonize Andrews.

1062
01:26:39,561 --> 01:26:42,223
You don't know about Andrews.

1063
01:26:42,330 --> 01:26:43,319
Don't talk rubbish!

1064
01:26:43,431 --> 01:26:47,265
I can put you behind the
bars fortrying to bribe me.

1065
01:26:47,368 --> 01:26:50,428
So better you leave for Mumbai.

1066
01:26:51,506 --> 01:26:55,442
Otherwise tomorrow's newspaper
headlines will have photo of a

1067
01:26:55,543 --> 01:26:59,377
Mumbai don shot dead by police.

1068
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:09,449
You cannot produce Christy
in court tomorrow.

1069
01:27:10,425 --> 01:27:15,124
On the way to court, I will..

1070
01:27:50,331 --> 01:27:53,664
Andrew Bandra, infamous Underworld don..

1071
01:27:54,335 --> 01:27:56,803
He cannot even sleep without making

1072
01:27:56,904 --> 01:27:59,168
at least ten new criminal cases a day.

1073
01:27:59,641 --> 01:28:02,269
Christy says he will jump custody.

1074
01:28:02,343 --> 01:28:04,709
Other hand Andrews says
he will kill Christy.

1075
01:28:06,381 --> 01:28:08,781
If he is here to finish off
Christy he will do it.

1076
01:28:08,916 --> 01:28:09,746
Better let him do it.

1077
01:28:09,851 --> 01:28:11,443
Who cares?

1078
01:28:12,253 --> 01:28:13,447
If I were in your position,
I would have taken the money

1079
01:28:13,554 --> 01:28:14,543
and helped in the execution.

1080
01:28:14,656 --> 01:28:16,556
But I am not you.

1081
01:28:17,292 --> 01:28:22,628
Christy's protection is my responsibility.

1082
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:34,940
I brought this van from Tamil Nadu.

1083
01:28:35,043 --> 01:28:36,738
It is bullet-proof.

1084
01:28:41,849 --> 01:28:46,286
Moreoverwe have NSG Chief
Commando Rashid Rahman

1085
01:28:46,421 --> 01:28:47,752
with a team of five commandos.

1086
01:28:47,855 --> 01:28:48,981
Rahid Rahman?

1087
01:28:49,590 --> 01:28:50,989
Vadakkan, you are fully geared!

1088
01:29:37,538 --> 01:29:42,066
Son of Sher who shook Mumbai
underworld in just two years.

1089
01:29:42,343 --> 01:29:44,675
The cub is now in the cage.

1090
01:29:45,546 --> 01:29:47,537
How did you become a cub?

1091
01:29:47,615 --> 01:29:48,980
Whether it was your mother
who went to forest or the

1092
01:29:49,083 --> 01:29:50,516
Lion strayed into your village?

1093
01:29:50,618 --> 01:29:53,610
Whether in forest or in village,
what born is a lion cub!

1094
01:29:53,821 --> 01:29:56,517
-But not like him who is
born to domestic dog.. -You..

1095
01:29:57,725 --> 01:30:00,717
Don't thinkthat an earthworm
that come out in rain can seek

1096
01:30:00,828 --> 01:30:03,626
-marriage proposal from a snake family..
-You..

1097
01:30:03,731 --> 01:30:06,063
-Go man!
-No..

1098
01:30:06,334 --> 01:30:09,394
There should not be any injury
marks on the body of the accused

1099
01:30:09,504 --> 01:30:10,664
while producing in court.

1100
01:30:10,772 --> 01:30:13,036
Just shift aside a bit.. sir

1101
01:30:13,141 --> 01:30:15,701
Otherwise Hariharwould suffer
injuries at the hands of the accused!

1102
01:30:15,810 --> 01:30:17,971
Rashid, lock him up.

1103
01:30:19,380 --> 01:30:20,711
Very nice van..

1104
01:30:20,815 --> 01:30:23,113
I have not seen such a setup
even with Mumbai police.

1105
01:30:41,135 --> 01:30:42,602
Escort both at the front
and backside of the van.

1106
01:30:42,703 --> 01:30:44,466
Only you will be in the front.

1107
01:30:45,072 --> 01:30:46,869
Lock the door and keep the key.

1108
01:30:50,011 --> 01:30:52,377
Sir..

1109
01:31:11,799 --> 01:31:15,064
Sir, my both legs are free.
Do you want to lock?

1110
01:31:17,638 --> 01:31:19,128
Is it a bullet proof van?

1111
01:31:19,874 --> 01:31:23,207
Nobody can shoot from inside
or outside into this vehicle.

1112
01:31:23,644 --> 01:31:24,736
But if somebody plants
a bomb underneath..

1113
01:31:24,846 --> 01:31:25,835
I mean bomb.. bomb..

1114
01:31:26,447 --> 01:31:30,178
Neither I'll allow anybody to kill
you nor will I allow you to escape.

1115
01:31:30,585 --> 01:31:32,553
Ifwe die that would also be together.

1116
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:21,761
What can you do with a pistol?

1117
01:32:22,036 --> 01:32:25,767
You cannot shoot from inside.

1118
01:32:26,107 --> 01:32:29,508
That is what our forefathers say,
"over-smartness is danger".

1119
01:33:45,353 --> 01:33:49,153
If I shoot now, the bullet proof
van would be engulfed in flames.

1120
01:33:49,256 --> 01:33:52,714
You get Christy out of the van.
I would spare Vadakkan.

1121
01:34:34,402 --> 01:34:36,870
Otherwise I will burn this van.

1122
01:34:45,379 --> 01:34:47,677
No sir.. Don't leave me!

1123
01:34:48,349 --> 01:34:50,977
The protection of the accused
is in the hands of police.

1124
01:35:04,398 --> 01:35:05,490
Lock him

1125
01:36:02,523 --> 01:36:05,390
We have a small relationship.

1126
01:36:12,900 --> 01:36:13,889
What did you say?

1127
01:36:14,301 --> 01:36:17,361
Christy cannot escape..

1128
01:36:18,906 --> 01:36:21,136
Now sit there and enjoy.

1129
01:36:28,182 --> 01:36:31,310
You are a sincere police officer.
I salute you sir.

1130
01:37:14,028 --> 01:37:16,895
There is no male person here now.
-Aren't you male?

1131
01:37:17,364 --> 01:37:20,231
Varghese Mopila has gone to
Trivandrum to meet the Chief Minister.

1132
01:37:20,334 --> 01:37:23,428
-For what?
-His brother Thomas is missing for

1133
01:37:23,771 --> 01:37:24,999
the last one and a half month.

1134
01:37:25,139 --> 01:37:27,767
There is no development
in the police investigation.

1135
01:37:27,975 --> 01:37:31,843
He has gone there to submit a
memorandum to the Chief Minister..

1136
01:37:31,979 --> 01:37:33,310
..against the police inaction.

1137
01:37:34,915 --> 01:37:36,177
Search..

1138
01:37:43,390 --> 01:37:46,223
Hey.. what is happening here?

1139
01:37:46,427 --> 01:37:47,758
We want to search this room.

1140
01:37:48,462 --> 01:37:49,486
Kunjacha..

1141
01:37:58,539 --> 01:38:01,337
What search is this?
That too when ladies are alone!

1142
01:38:01,508 --> 01:38:08,243
Police makes entry and exit in families
of wanted criminals as per their will.

1143
01:38:08,349 --> 01:38:11,785
My brother is not a coward
to hide inside a cellar.

1144
01:38:12,152 --> 01:38:14,120
He must have left the country
a long time ago.

1145
01:38:14,488 --> 01:38:17,286
Its better you put
the search to lnterpol.

1146
01:38:17,825 --> 01:38:18,587
Stop

1147
01:38:19,093 --> 01:38:21,994
This house will be under
police surveillance from today.

1148
01:38:22,329 --> 01:38:25,025
Johson and Damodar..

1149
01:38:25,199 --> 01:38:28,498
You are on duty here
day and night.

1150
01:38:29,203 --> 01:38:32,798
Inform me if there
is any clue on Christy.

1151
01:38:52,426 --> 01:38:54,018
Stop

1152
01:38:54,228 --> 01:38:56,253
Where are you going without
bell and brake?

1153
01:38:56,430 --> 01:38:59,888
This is not an inn for the
police to roam around.

1154
01:39:00,100 --> 01:39:01,829
You need to seek permission in advance

1155
01:39:01,969 --> 01:39:03,061
from the Personal Assistant, that's me.

1156
01:39:03,170 --> 01:39:07,106
I don't need your permission for I have
not come to your mother-in-law's house.

1157
01:39:07,207 --> 01:39:08,105
Get lost..

1158
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:13,910
Why are you here?

1159
01:39:14,148 --> 01:39:16,946
Sir, it is on your special interest that I am

1160
01:39:17,351 --> 01:39:21,947
directed to enquire George Kutty murder case.

1161
01:39:22,156 --> 01:39:24,317
Sir, I need some vital information

1162
01:39:24,491 --> 01:39:26,015
from you regarding the case.

1163
01:39:26,126 --> 01:39:27,491
I have already instructed you not to drag

1164
01:39:27,695 --> 01:39:31,358
me or my daughter into that case.

1165
01:39:31,465 --> 01:39:36,960
I wish to keep you out of all these.
That's why I am seeking the facts.

1166
01:39:38,605 --> 01:39:39,503
You did not say anything.

1167
01:39:39,606 --> 01:39:41,437
Whether you a teacher and the minister

1168
01:39:41,542 --> 01:39:43,339
a student to reply whenever you ask?

1169
01:39:43,477 --> 01:39:46,275
He will ask you and you should reply.

1170
01:39:46,447 --> 01:39:49,939
-That's democracy here.
Do you understand? -No..

1171
01:39:50,150 --> 01:39:52,618
You may go now.
I'll speak to the DGP.

1172
01:39:54,888 --> 01:40:01,885
The rulers imagine as if police were
a gooseberry in their hand.

1173
01:40:02,196 --> 01:40:07,224
People tend to believe that the
integrity and honesty of police

1174
01:40:07,368 --> 01:40:09,563
can be bought by money and power.

1175
01:40:10,004 --> 01:40:13,167
-At least you should not think like that!
-What do you want now?

1176
01:40:13,540 --> 01:40:14,564
I want details about the person

1177
01:40:14,908 --> 01:40:17,502
who was imported from Mumbai
to rescue your daughter.

1178
01:40:18,012 --> 01:40:19,206
It was Christy.

1179
01:40:19,413 --> 01:40:21,574
Whetheryou lost confidence in police

1180
01:40:21,982 --> 01:40:23,916
that you hired the services of a goon..

1181
01:40:24,018 --> 01:40:26,009
He is not a goon.
An old friend of mine..

1182
01:40:27,154 --> 01:40:31,250
Do you think the real accused in
the case is that friend of yours?

1183
01:40:31,425 --> 01:40:33,188
That is to be proved by police.

1184
01:40:33,427 --> 01:40:37,625
For that I need to speak to your daughter.

1185
01:40:38,332 --> 01:40:41,028
-She is not well. Taking rest..
-No issues..

1186
01:40:41,135 --> 01:40:43,933
-I will go there and see.
-No. I'll call her.

1187
01:40:58,185 --> 01:41:02,519
What is the ransom paid to George
Kutty for setting free Meenakshi?

1188
01:41:02,689 --> 01:41:04,418
Only my dad knows about the money.

1189
01:41:04,691 --> 01:41:10,596
Did you see Christy killing the
kidnapper and escaping with the money?

1190
01:41:10,764 --> 01:41:12,197
He did not kill anyone.

1191
01:41:12,566 --> 01:41:15,399
I saw the kidnapper
fleeing with the money.

1192
01:41:18,038 --> 01:41:21,371
Whether it is the admiration for
your savior makes you tell this lie?

1193
01:41:21,675 --> 01:41:23,370
I doubt your fatherwould
have taught you this..

1194
01:41:23,610 --> 01:41:27,205
-I told you the truth.
-Okay... you can go.

1195
01:41:33,153 --> 01:41:37,146
How much ransom was paid
to save your daughter?

1196
01:41:37,524 --> 01:41:39,651
-That is..
-Did you forget that sir?

1197
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:42,058
-One and One ten!
-How much did you say?

1198
01:41:42,162 --> 01:41:45,928
1 0 million to the kidnapper;
10 million and above for the savior..

1199
01:41:46,033 --> 01:41:48,092
He is very costly!

1200
01:41:49,369 --> 01:41:50,734
I take leave then.

1201
01:41:54,241 --> 01:41:56,937
-Joseph, don't put me in trouble.
-I will try sir.

1202
01:41:57,044 --> 01:41:59,740
-What trouble could he cause?
-Sir, one more thing..

1203
01:42:00,247 --> 01:42:02,511
Where did you get this money from?

1204
01:42:02,749 --> 01:42:04,182
Whether it is black or white?

1205
01:42:04,318 --> 01:42:08,448
How come he knows that?
You better ask Kumaran Thampy.

1206
01:42:08,655 --> 01:42:11,988
It is not a secret that Kumaran
Thampy paid you the money.

1207
01:42:12,159 --> 01:42:15,492
But I just asked.
I am going sir.

1208
01:42:16,396 --> 01:42:17,522
You just come..

1209
01:42:21,034 --> 01:42:25,368
Is there any problem?
We can manage by carrots!

1210
01:42:25,472 --> 01:42:27,531
I have the power to do it.

1211
01:42:29,309 --> 01:42:31,971
-What is this?
-This is lPS power.

1212
01:42:32,546 --> 01:42:36,209
You filthy people spoil honest
ministers like him by coaching

1213
01:42:36,416 --> 01:42:39,510
that law is to break and

1214
01:42:39,753 --> 01:42:43,348
corruption is their birthright.

1215
01:42:43,657 --> 01:42:46,524
You should recall this
when we meet next time.

1216
01:42:49,563 --> 01:42:52,054
A transfer smells..

1217
01:43:05,312 --> 01:43:06,279
Why are you here?

1218
01:43:07,281 --> 01:43:08,805
Came to lodge a complaint..

1219
01:43:09,183 --> 01:43:10,844
Is it about Kochu Thoma's case?

1220
01:43:11,518 --> 01:43:15,682
But there is no special order from
Chief Minister's office on the enquiry..

1221
01:43:15,889 --> 01:43:17,413
-Sir, this is not that case.
-Then?

1222
01:43:21,395 --> 01:43:23,363
Oh.. Loafer nuisance..

1223
01:43:24,598 --> 01:43:27,533
But why does underworld king Christy's

1224
01:43:27,701 --> 01:43:29,293
sister need police to tackle this problem?

1225
01:43:29,503 --> 01:43:32,495
You just call him here and tell him.

1226
01:43:32,873 --> 01:43:34,397
If my brother comes to know this,

1227
01:43:34,541 --> 01:43:38,910
police would lose two of its sub lnspectors.

1228
01:43:39,379 --> 01:43:43,873
Sir, she was talking about the two police

1229
01:43:44,318 --> 01:43:45,876
men posted at Palamattom house.

1230
01:43:52,559 --> 01:43:53,526
It's enough?

1231
01:43:56,163 --> 01:43:58,597
There will be a problem if
Varghese Mopila see this.

1232
01:43:58,699 --> 01:44:00,291
Whether he asks for share?

1233
01:44:01,435 --> 01:44:04,404
-But where is he? -He is in
Trivandrum. Coming back tomorrow..

1234
01:44:05,239 --> 01:44:07,833
-Do you drink?
-Once in a while..

1235
01:44:08,642 --> 01:44:10,132
-Then give the glass to him.
-Drink man..

1236
01:44:10,244 --> 01:44:12,405
No. Stella is alone!

1237
01:44:16,516 --> 01:44:18,211
-You have it.
-No..

1238
01:44:18,318 --> 01:44:21,913
-I don't want.
No! -Drink it!

1239
01:44:24,558 --> 01:44:26,389
The water is exhausted.

1240
01:44:26,660 --> 01:44:28,287
-Let me go and bring it.
-I'll get it.

1241
01:44:28,662 --> 01:44:33,190
You sit here and finish it.

1242
01:44:49,349 --> 01:44:51,214
Water is finished.
Like to get some water..

1243
01:44:51,351 --> 01:44:53,911
You go out.. Get out!

1244
01:44:54,521 --> 01:45:00,482
We have the permission to
inspect here any time.

1245
01:45:00,961 --> 01:45:03,953
-Kunjachan..
-She is calling me.

1246
01:45:04,298 --> 01:45:05,822
-I'll go..
-You sit here.

1247
01:45:05,932 --> 01:45:08,196
It may be for water.
Sir would get it.

1248
01:45:19,746 --> 01:45:21,270
I came to take water..

1249
01:45:33,727 --> 01:45:35,854
-I told them in advance.
-Shift aside and stand.

1250
01:45:37,698 --> 01:45:42,328
The police uniform is not the
license for doing raunchiness.

1251
01:45:43,270 --> 01:45:46,728
The first thing police should do is the
cleansing of its department.

1252
01:45:51,044 --> 01:45:53,478
-Sir, I am..
-Throw them inside..

1253
01:46:03,857 --> 01:46:05,688
I expected thanks.

1254
01:46:06,393 --> 01:46:10,022
But SP Joseph Vadakkan should
say sorry for this mistake.

1255
01:46:10,464 --> 01:46:12,227
I do expect that.

1256
01:46:21,475 --> 01:46:23,466
There is news about Christy in paper.

1257
01:46:23,643 --> 01:46:26,840
The prime accused Christy escaped
with the help of Minister.

1258
01:46:40,660 --> 01:46:43,288
-You keep the files in the office.
-Ok sir.

1259
01:46:45,665 --> 01:46:47,394
Come on, ice

1260
01:46:49,469 --> 01:46:50,800
If some drink is left out,
it would be nice

1261
01:46:50,904 --> 01:46:52,565
I'll drink it by licking

1262
01:46:52,806 --> 01:46:53,966
This is for whom?

1263
01:47:12,726 --> 01:47:14,694
See! How the tiger is swaying

1264
01:47:23,570 --> 01:47:24,798
Why are you here?

1265
01:47:26,540 --> 01:47:28,565
Is this the way to
behave to a guest?

1266
01:47:28,642 --> 01:47:30,439
We need to have
some manners..

1267
01:47:30,710 --> 01:47:33,042
What do you want for dinner?
North lndian or south lndian dish..

1268
01:47:33,380 --> 01:47:35,610
I asked you..
What business have you got here?

1269
01:47:35,982 --> 01:47:38,849
You have invited me here.

1270
01:47:39,419 --> 01:47:42,513
Your police is searching every
nook and cornerfor me.

1271
01:47:42,756 --> 01:47:44,348
If there is any place where I can be safe..

1272
01:47:44,458 --> 01:47:46,653
..it is the Home Minister's house.

1273
01:47:47,594 --> 01:47:50,119
How smart he is?
Let me kiss you.

1274
01:47:50,397 --> 01:47:51,523
You call the police from outside.

1275
01:47:51,932 --> 01:47:53,832
Call police if you are bold enough.

1276
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,560
By the time, I'll call the media.

1277
01:47:56,803 --> 01:48:00,637
I have a real feast for those
who lookfor hot news.

1278
01:48:00,740 --> 01:48:02,765
Feast! Oh.. I haven't made anything.

1279
01:48:02,876 --> 01:48:06,073
Here I have only rice and onion curry..

1280
01:48:07,781 --> 01:48:10,579
These hide and shoot candid

1281
01:48:10,717 --> 01:48:15,177
cameras are easily available
in the market for 50 dollars.

1282
01:48:17,090 --> 01:48:19,718
I was brought here by you
through your home secretary to

1283
01:48:19,826 --> 01:48:21,817
do the job which your police could not.

1284
01:48:21,962 --> 01:48:23,862
Ill show the world these
stories of home minister..

1285
01:48:23,964 --> 01:48:25,192
TV Channels can
telecast these visuals.

1286
01:48:25,599 --> 01:48:27,760
-What do you want?
-That's what I am asking..

1287
01:48:27,901 --> 01:48:30,165
-What do you need for dinner?
-You stupid.. Go away.

1288
01:48:31,705 --> 01:48:33,935
I want to know about the
conspiracy in framing me in

1289
01:48:34,140 --> 01:48:36,870
the George Kutty murder case.

1290
01:48:37,043 --> 01:48:39,136
It is the police not me who
found out who the culprit is.

1291
01:48:39,479 --> 01:48:42,812
The same police should bring the
actual killer in front of me here.

1292
01:48:42,949 --> 01:48:43,973
I will remain here till such time.

1293
01:48:44,150 --> 01:48:45,082
I cannot allow an
accused to stay here.

1294
01:48:45,619 --> 01:48:47,985
You only know those local police and

1295
01:48:48,088 --> 01:48:50,113
quotation gangs who come at yourwill.

1296
01:48:50,891 --> 01:48:54,019
But I am above your three
wheeled intelligence. Mind it..

1297
01:48:59,866 --> 01:49:03,165
They are not under house arrest.
Absolutely free..

1298
01:49:03,637 --> 01:49:06,538
But my guys will have
their eyes on them.

1299
01:49:15,649 --> 01:49:16,809
Vadakkan sir..

1300
01:49:19,252 --> 01:49:19,980
Move

1301
01:49:30,897 --> 01:49:32,524
Sir, any chance for a shoot out?

1302
01:49:32,799 --> 01:49:35,825
If so give me an old pistol.
I love to shoot.

1303
01:49:36,069 --> 01:49:38,867
-Promise. I didn't shoot.
-Go man.

1304
01:49:48,515 --> 01:49:50,506
Why are you guys here?

1305
01:49:50,917 --> 01:49:53,147
There is lntelligence report
that Christy is still in town.

1306
01:49:53,553 --> 01:49:56,044
-Then?
-His target is you.

1307
01:49:56,222 --> 01:49:57,985
The force is for your protection.

1308
01:49:58,091 --> 01:50:01,060
You use this force to
trap Christy first.

1309
01:50:01,661 --> 01:50:03,026
I don't need any protection.

1310
01:50:14,107 --> 01:50:15,768
If he doesn't want protection, that's fine.

1311
01:50:18,144 --> 01:50:21,079
Anyway I am taking off for two days.
Going to home in Kannur.

1312
01:50:21,247 --> 01:50:23,272
-My mom is calling me continuously
-But Christy?

1313
01:50:23,683 --> 01:50:24,581
You track him..

1314
01:50:25,118 --> 01:50:26,779
Isn't there any otherwork for you?

1315
01:50:26,920 --> 01:50:27,887
From the talk of minister,
it is understood that

1316
01:50:27,988 --> 01:50:29,956
Christy reached Mumbai.

1317
01:50:30,890 --> 01:50:31,857
Mom..

1318
01:50:34,227 --> 01:50:38,163
Even if late, I'll be there today.

1319
01:50:42,202 --> 01:50:43,931
She is not fair.

1320
01:50:44,771 --> 01:50:46,762
For fairness just need to
apply fair and lovely cream.

1321
01:50:46,906 --> 01:50:50,672
See my case. I was black.
But look at me now..

1322
01:50:51,344 --> 01:50:54,279
Let him say yes..
I'll do the rest.

1323
01:50:59,119 --> 01:51:00,279
Sir, you were here.

1324
01:51:00,654 --> 01:51:03,214
Heard that he was in Cochin.
Now got transferred here..?

1325
01:51:03,323 --> 01:51:06,781
God, he would kill me
if he sees my face here!

1326
01:51:06,893 --> 01:51:09,657
-What a cheat you have done to me, mom!
-No need to fear.

1327
01:51:09,796 --> 01:51:11,161
I'll tell him.

1328
01:51:12,065 --> 01:51:15,592
I told you several times
not to come here.

1329
01:51:15,802 --> 01:51:17,793
-I asked him to come over.
-For what?

1330
01:51:18,171 --> 01:51:21,971
She is looking for a house maid.
That's why I came.

1331
01:51:22,075 --> 01:51:23,064
Why you need these
photographs for that?

1332
01:51:23,243 --> 01:51:25,541
She can select a good girl
You also select one.

1333
01:51:25,645 --> 01:51:27,442
Is it a beauty contest
or selection of maid?

1334
01:51:27,881 --> 01:51:30,645
It is her culinary skills and
cleanliness that matters.

1335
01:51:31,084 --> 01:51:33,348
These girls have all those qualities.

1336
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:36,853
You just need to tie the knot.

1337
01:51:36,956 --> 01:51:40,153
-They would do all house chores,
that too without salary. -What?

1338
01:51:40,393 --> 01:51:43,157
Wives are meant to be
those salary less home maids.

1339
01:51:43,296 --> 01:51:45,196
-My hand..
-Leave him..

1340
01:51:46,533 --> 01:51:50,299
Every motherwants to see their
children leading a good family life.

1341
01:51:50,403 --> 01:51:53,964
You wanted me to become an lPS Officer.

1342
01:51:54,174 --> 01:51:55,368
That wish was realized.

1343
01:51:55,709 --> 01:51:59,372
Such a police officer should
have an unbending spine

1344
01:51:59,479 --> 01:52:00,946
to keep his head high..

1345
01:52:01,147 --> 01:52:03,479
But wife, kids et al would seep
out the valor of a policeman.

1346
01:52:03,917 --> 01:52:08,286
That's why all the policemen
in the world remain unmarried.

1347
01:52:09,489 --> 01:52:11,389
If I have become a liability..

1348
01:52:11,624 --> 01:52:14,024
send me to some old age home.

1349
01:52:14,594 --> 01:52:16,084
Got angry with me, mom?

1350
01:52:16,296 --> 01:52:19,925
Every week I drive all the
way from Cochin to Kannur.

1351
01:52:20,033 --> 01:52:21,000
For what..?

1352
01:52:21,101 --> 01:52:24,161
-To see my dear mother!
-I don't want to hear anything.

1353
01:52:24,471 --> 01:52:28,464
Sir, don't think I am advising you.

1354
01:52:28,575 --> 01:52:32,443
Who is there to look after
you during old age?

1355
01:52:35,515 --> 01:52:36,504
Do you like her?

1356
01:52:37,517 --> 01:52:39,678
Her name is Stella.
She is in Cochi

1357
01:52:39,953 --> 01:52:41,511
Character is very good.

1358
01:52:41,621 --> 01:52:45,455
She would hide inside if she
sees any other men at home.

1359
01:52:45,558 --> 01:52:49,187
My brother is not a coward
to hide inside a cellar.

1360
01:52:49,696 --> 01:52:53,530
SP Joseph Vadakkan should
say sorry for this mistake.

1361
01:52:53,700 --> 01:52:56,635
Very traditional family..

1362
01:52:56,736 --> 01:52:58,033
Her father Vargese Mopila

1363
01:52:58,138 --> 01:53:00,106
is a retired captain.

1364
01:53:00,206 --> 01:53:01,605
Two sons and two daughters.

1365
01:53:01,708 --> 01:53:02,936
Eldest son is Christy.

1366
01:53:03,042 --> 01:53:05,272
He is General Manager of a
company which makes guns.

1367
01:53:05,378 --> 01:53:06,572
A high post..

1368
01:53:07,080 --> 01:53:08,138
His conduct is very good.

1369
01:53:08,281 --> 01:53:10,511
The younger one is trying
to become a priest.

1370
01:53:10,617 --> 01:53:14,451
Eldest daughter's husband died recently
but not because of his fault.

1371
01:53:14,554 --> 01:53:15,987
A natural death..

1372
01:53:16,189 --> 01:53:18,054
So by all means they are
a good match for us.

1373
01:53:18,158 --> 01:53:21,685
-A family with the blessings
of peace and calm. -Neat family..

1374
01:53:21,961 --> 01:53:26,455
You know.. I came to Cochin
as the in charge of the investigation

1375
01:53:26,566 --> 01:53:27,999
-of the death in her family.
-ls it?

1376
01:53:28,101 --> 01:53:30,194
-Her eldest brother Christy is
the accused in this murder. -ls it?

1377
01:53:30,303 --> 01:53:32,203
The dead man is her sister's husband.

1378
01:53:33,206 --> 01:53:36,266
That's means, this will not work.
Give the photograph.

1379
01:53:38,444 --> 01:53:40,139
Then, keep the photo with you

1380
01:53:40,313 --> 01:53:41,678
It would help the investigation.

1381
01:53:45,418 --> 01:53:48,353
Even though the marriage broker

1382
01:53:48,454 --> 01:53:51,617
concealed certain facts, no doubt,
they are a high family

1383
01:53:51,724 --> 01:53:52,952
based on tradition.

1384
01:53:55,061 --> 01:53:58,462
People wish to have a father like him.

1385
01:53:58,565 --> 01:54:00,260
Capt. Varghese Mopila is
my role model now.

1386
01:54:02,001 --> 01:54:04,265
She is the younger daughter, Stella.

1387
01:54:04,370 --> 01:54:09,967
At times even I was stunned..

1388
01:54:10,076 --> 01:54:12,306
..before her attitude

1389
01:54:12,712 --> 01:54:15,203
I need a girl like this at home.

1390
01:54:16,282 --> 01:54:17,510
What did you say, mom?

1391
01:54:17,617 --> 01:54:20,780
I wish to see this girl
who is capable of keeping

1392
01:54:21,054 --> 01:54:22,112
a control over you.

1393
01:54:22,222 --> 01:54:23,985
Mom..

1394
01:54:24,090 --> 01:54:25,284
No need to say anything.

1395
01:54:25,391 --> 01:54:28,053
If she comes to my home,

1396
01:54:28,161 --> 01:54:32,029
you will never be bending
your spine in front of any.

1397
01:54:43,243 --> 01:54:45,211
There is no police to guard here?

1398
01:54:45,378 --> 01:54:47,608
But minister has ordered
not to keep guards.

1399
01:54:47,714 --> 01:54:50,308
I think he is losing interest
in police and governance.

1400
01:54:50,416 --> 01:54:52,247
He spends most of
the time with family.

1401
01:54:52,352 --> 01:54:54,513
If things go like this,
I would find problem.

1402
01:55:00,426 --> 01:55:03,691
I told to contact me on
phone if there is any urgency.

1403
01:55:03,796 --> 01:55:07,027
He had insisted to
meet you in person.

1404
01:55:07,133 --> 01:55:08,566
Why you are spending more time at

1405
01:55:08,635 --> 01:55:11,536
-home keeping off from governance..?
-I am under an Ayurvedic treatment.

1406
01:55:11,638 --> 01:55:13,765
It may take one week more.

1407
01:55:13,873 --> 01:55:15,534
-What is the matter?
-Nothing sir..

1408
01:55:15,642 --> 01:55:17,109
I came with water.

1409
01:55:17,210 --> 01:55:18,768
Not to you man..

1410
01:55:18,878 --> 01:55:22,143
Christy will be arrested soon.

1411
01:55:24,884 --> 01:55:27,785
SP Vadakkan is planning
some intelligent moves.

1412
01:55:27,887 --> 01:55:32,153
Tell secret in low voice.
Otherwise it will be public.

1413
01:55:32,258 --> 01:55:35,921
No..
I would not divulge this to anyone.

1414
01:55:36,596 --> 01:55:37,927
What is in your mind?

1415
01:55:38,464 --> 01:55:43,527
He is marrying Capt. Varghese
Mopila's daughter Stella.

1416
01:55:43,803 --> 01:55:45,828
The engagement is already held.

1417
01:55:46,606 --> 01:55:48,267
But this is cheating.

1418
01:55:48,608 --> 01:55:50,269
Just a ploy to catch Christy..

1419
01:55:51,711 --> 01:55:54,874
He makes use of all
wickedness to catch the culprit.

1420
01:55:54,981 --> 01:55:56,949
Christy would come for
his sister's wedding.

1421
01:55:57,417 --> 01:55:58,816
Otherwise SP Vadakkan
will make him come.

1422
01:55:59,285 --> 01:56:00,479
And Christy will be
taken into custody.

1423
01:56:00,586 --> 01:56:02,417
The wedding would be
cancelled on the issue.

1424
01:56:03,356 --> 01:56:05,654
I know Vadakkan right
from the training camp.

1425
01:56:05,992 --> 01:56:08,187
He takes vengeance
like a rogue elephant.

1426
01:56:08,261 --> 01:56:10,752
A third person should
not know about all this.

1427
01:56:10,897 --> 01:56:14,196
-But a fourth person heard it all.
-Who? You..

1428
01:56:14,300 --> 01:56:15,961
-Pappu..
-Sir, I'll tell

1429
01:56:16,502 --> 01:56:19,801
-Then you tell..
-The person above has heard it.

1430
01:56:25,278 --> 01:56:26,802
I meant God!

1431
01:56:26,879 --> 01:56:28,403
-You go inside..
-So you don't want water?

1432
01:56:28,514 --> 01:56:29,572
Keep it and go

1433
01:56:31,284 --> 01:56:32,273
You go

1434
01:56:33,753 --> 01:56:34,617
Tell the other matter

1435
01:56:34,721 --> 01:56:36,313
I'll tell you. Wait.

1436
01:56:36,522 --> 01:56:37,454
What?

1437
01:56:37,690 --> 01:56:41,854
Whether the wicked commissioner's
head remains there while tying the knot?

1438
01:56:41,961 --> 01:56:43,588
IfVadakkan is rogue, then the

1439
01:56:43,696 --> 01:56:46,688
person above is a rutting elephant.

1440
01:56:47,834 --> 01:56:48,960
-Go away!
-Mom!

1441
01:56:49,836 --> 01:56:51,428
-You are still here?
-No

1442
01:56:51,537 --> 01:56:55,997
The commissioner's father
wanted me to convey their

1443
01:56:56,275 --> 01:56:59,005
interest in an alliance with us.

1444
01:56:59,946 --> 01:57:03,973
That Commissioner guy is
very fond of Meenakshi.

1445
01:57:04,083 --> 01:57:07,917
They are willing to write off the money
which we owe them, if this proposal works.

1446
01:57:08,788 --> 01:57:13,691
If you close your eyes a few things,
money will flow to us.

1447
01:57:15,661 --> 01:57:16,855
I need to think about it.

1448
01:57:17,730 --> 01:57:19,027
-You may go.
-Ok

1449
01:57:26,105 --> 01:57:27,629
Dad, I am Christy..

1450
01:57:29,275 --> 01:57:30,139
What do you want?

1451
01:57:30,410 --> 01:57:32,378
Stella's engagement is held?

1452
01:57:33,112 --> 01:57:36,604
Marrying his daughter is
the responsibility of a father.

1453
01:57:36,716 --> 01:57:38,149
Dad, this is cheating..

1454
01:57:38,584 --> 01:57:41,178
It is ploy by Vadakkan to trap me.

1455
01:57:41,721 --> 01:57:43,621
We should withdraw from this marriage.

1456
01:57:43,723 --> 01:57:45,281
Stella's life cannot be a
playing ground of the police.

1457
01:57:45,391 --> 01:57:49,259
No. I believe that my elder son
is taken back by the almighty.

1458
01:57:49,495 --> 01:57:53,192
In his place God
has now gifted this lPS man.

1459
01:57:53,299 --> 01:57:56,757
-Dad..
-I have fixed my daughter's marriage.

1460
01:57:56,869 --> 01:57:58,632
The bridegroom is Joseph Vadakkan.

1461
01:57:59,072 --> 01:58:02,701
The wedding is at the Cathedral
Church on 11th January.

1462
01:58:03,676 --> 01:58:05,576
You are wanted by the police.

1463
01:58:05,878 --> 01:58:09,609
You attend the wedding of
your sister with a policeman.

1464
01:58:09,916 --> 01:58:12,111
Let Capt. Varghese Mopila see that!

1465
01:58:23,362 --> 01:58:26,991
Man missing case No. 3509
Get me the file.

1466
01:58:31,504 --> 01:58:33,563
Mr. Radhakrishnan from Crime Branch.

1467
01:58:33,906 --> 01:58:35,669
Orderfrom Chief Minister's office..

1468
01:58:35,842 --> 01:58:38,072
The reinvestigation of Kochu Thoma man

1469
01:58:38,478 --> 01:58:41,003
missing case goes to Crime Branch

1470
01:58:41,114 --> 01:58:42,945
at the request of Capt. Varghese Mopila.

1471
01:58:53,392 --> 01:58:55,121
You call the crane guy Murugan

1472
01:58:55,261 --> 01:58:58,662
Dump his body into
the marshy field in our estate

1473
01:59:01,901 --> 01:59:03,425
This is not that big case.

1474
01:59:03,636 --> 01:59:05,570
Kochu Thoma used to go for
divine tours and he might have

1475
01:59:05,705 --> 01:59:07,036
..gone some long distance.

1476
01:59:07,140 --> 01:59:08,767
He would come back
after some time.

1477
01:59:09,809 --> 01:59:11,003
But this case is different.

1478
01:59:11,444 --> 01:59:15,574
Kochu Thoma was missing from 12.05.10.

1479
01:59:15,748 --> 01:59:20,776
There is no trace of his car KBE 2110 since
then.

1480
01:59:21,387 --> 01:59:24,948
In my opinion, Kochu Thoma
must have been killed.

1481
01:59:25,091 --> 01:59:28,117
The killers would have destroyed
the evidences including the car.

1482
01:59:28,461 --> 01:59:31,862
If you need anything more,
please collect from the office.

1483
01:59:35,368 --> 01:59:38,496
Yet another case into the
list of 300 unsolved cases.

1484
01:59:39,405 --> 01:59:40,337
Let it find its way out..

1485
01:59:41,407 --> 01:59:43,841
I came to congratulate you.

1486
01:59:44,544 --> 01:59:45,943
You are getting married?

1487
01:59:46,345 --> 01:59:49,872
Whether the church would turn
against police because of this fraud?

1488
01:59:49,982 --> 01:59:50,949
Fraud..?

1489
01:59:51,384 --> 01:59:54,615
Joseph, I know your crooked ways.

1490
01:59:54,854 --> 01:59:58,119
Now the way you have selected
to trap Christy is good.

1491
01:59:58,257 --> 01:59:59,690
He would fall in this trap.

1492
02:00:01,894 --> 02:00:05,591
His sister is a figure to watch.

1493
02:00:06,032 --> 02:00:07,761
I also had a feel for her.

1494
02:00:08,267 --> 02:00:10,633
But when you get her,
don't forget to share.

1495
02:00:11,337 --> 02:00:13,931
You scoundrel.. what did we share?

1496
02:00:14,473 --> 02:00:17,408
A bloody fellow who doesn't even
recognize his mother and sister.

1497
02:00:17,777 --> 02:00:21,372
Joseph Vadakkan's marriage is not
for cheating ortrapping anybody.

1498
02:00:26,118 --> 02:00:32,148
If you come for the marriage,
you can eat up and go..

1499
02:00:32,291 --> 02:00:35,692
Don't think that I didn't
invite my dearest friend

1500
02:00:47,807 --> 02:00:51,004
May God bless you!

1501
02:00:51,110 --> 02:00:51,940
Come, dear!

1502
02:00:52,178 --> 02:00:54,237
The girl is unlucky as both her brothers

1503
02:00:54,380 --> 02:00:56,473
failed to show up and offer blessings!

1504
02:00:57,550 --> 02:01:00,917
Father, sometimes god
decides against ourwishes.

1505
02:01:01,721 --> 02:01:07,921
Both my sons are not competent to
stand here holding their heads high.

1506
02:01:08,594 --> 02:01:14,362
But I really wanted one person to be here,

1507
02:01:15,034 --> 02:01:16,899
my brother Kochu Thoma..

1508
02:01:26,946 --> 02:01:29,437
There is a call from Trivandrum.

1509
02:01:29,849 --> 02:01:31,544
He may be Kochu Thoma!

1510
02:01:33,286 --> 02:01:35,186
God, let it be Kochu Thoma!

1511
02:01:36,289 --> 02:01:37,187
Hello.. Thoma brother!

1512
02:01:37,390 --> 02:01:38,982
This is from Chief Minister's office.

1513
02:01:39,091 --> 02:01:42,549
You come to Trivandrum to
discuss Kochu Thoma's case.

1514
02:01:49,135 --> 02:01:51,968
I am friend of Christy.
Christy wishes to see you.

1515
02:01:52,505 --> 02:01:54,996
Hey.. stop the vehicle.

1516
02:01:55,107 --> 02:01:56,665
Varghese sir did not enter!

1517
02:02:16,362 --> 02:02:21,857
I want to see you in a bridal outfit
than anybody else.

1518
02:02:22,501 --> 02:02:27,097
But you have fallen prey to the tricks

1519
02:02:28,207 --> 02:02:34,237
of an lPS officer who can do any bad

1520
02:02:35,114 --> 02:02:37,639
things for position and recognition.

1521
02:02:38,551 --> 02:02:40,212
You please pay heed to what I say!

1522
02:02:40,453 --> 02:02:44,913
Brother, please don't ask me to
withdraw from the marriage.

1523
02:02:46,592 --> 02:02:49,686
I have several failed marriage
proposals all due to the

1524
02:02:49,795 --> 02:02:52,127
hearsays about a criminal brother.

1525
02:02:54,433 --> 02:02:57,027
I trust this marriage.

1526
02:02:57,336 --> 02:02:58,360
If this does not work, I'm sure

1527
02:02:58,537 --> 02:03:02,701
this is the last time I stand
before someone in a bridal wear.

1528
02:03:04,877 --> 02:03:10,611
If you trust him that much, I am also
coming to attend the ceremony.

1529
02:03:11,717 --> 02:03:14,845
But if I am convinced that
he is cheating you,

1530
02:03:15,254 --> 02:03:17,119
don't stop me then! Come!

1531
02:03:20,159 --> 02:03:22,059
Do you want to attend the function?

1532
02:03:22,228 --> 02:03:23,627
The church area is full of police.

1533
02:03:24,096 --> 02:03:28,760
Commissioner Thampy is there
waiting to arrest you.

1534
02:03:29,802 --> 02:03:32,771
I want to see my
sister tying the knot.

1535
02:03:32,972 --> 02:03:35,805
I want to see the marriage
standing in front of my dad.

1536
02:03:35,908 --> 02:03:36,897
You take the car..

1537
02:03:38,844 --> 02:03:40,903
Varghese, where is the bride?

1538
02:03:41,046 --> 02:03:43,037
The bride's car started
off to the church first.

1539
02:03:43,349 --> 02:03:45,510
Kunjacha, you just check..

1540
02:03:46,986 --> 02:03:47,975
It is coming!

1541
02:03:51,624 --> 02:03:53,785
Let's not make it late. Come fast.

1542
02:03:56,996 --> 02:03:57,928
Brother..

1543
02:03:58,931 --> 02:04:02,867
You go. I will follow you.

1544
02:04:10,242 --> 02:04:11,174
Let's go.

1545
02:04:59,492 --> 02:05:00,925
Get down

1546
02:05:03,963 --> 02:05:05,021
Where is Christy?

1547
02:05:05,498 --> 02:05:07,693
I am asking you..
Where is Christy?

1548
02:05:08,934 --> 02:05:09,958
Here.

1549
02:05:14,907 --> 02:05:19,776
Harihar, there is no point
running around in search of me.

1550
02:05:20,279 --> 02:05:24,739
I am here in church attending
S P Vadakkan's marriage.

1551
02:05:44,270 --> 02:05:47,364
Don't rush here.

1552
02:05:48,307 --> 02:05:49,399
I am leaving.

1553
02:05:49,975 --> 02:05:51,533
I am just about to
get a glimpse of

1554
02:05:51,644 --> 02:05:53,635
Capt. Varghese Mopila.
I leave after that..

1555
02:06:02,688 --> 02:06:05,054
Christy will attend even the

1556
02:06:05,257 --> 02:06:10,092
marriage of American President,
let alone the case of lPs officer.

1557
02:06:11,096 --> 02:06:14,429
At least, I am son of a
proud army man.

1558
02:06:16,235 --> 02:06:16,792
You..

1559
02:06:17,236 --> 02:06:19,295
I'll be at your close distance.

1560
02:06:19,471 --> 02:06:23,032
Let's play the game of police
and thief till next time we meet.

1561
02:06:25,477 --> 02:06:26,409
Damn it..

1562
02:06:29,648 --> 02:06:33,345
I cannot guard here leaving
my official works anymore.

1563
02:06:34,219 --> 02:06:37,586
-Who asked you to?
-My daughter's marriage is fixed.

1564
02:06:39,491 --> 02:06:41,823
For God sake, you please leave this place.

1565
02:06:42,194 --> 02:06:44,856
The engagement is on next Monday.

1566
02:06:45,497 --> 02:06:47,590
We would have lot of guests
here including ministers,

1567
02:06:47,700 --> 02:06:50,100
police officials and relatives.

1568
02:06:51,804 --> 02:06:53,738
If outside world knows about the

1569
02:06:54,073 --> 02:06:56,803
presence of a person wanted by police
in the house of home minister..

1570
02:06:56,909 --> 02:06:59,878
You said it. That is why I am
saying you to go back.

1571
02:07:00,079 --> 02:07:02,377
I will arrange for money,
flight tickets or anything.

1572
02:07:02,681 --> 02:07:04,046
I'll also make you safely reach Mumbai

1573
02:07:04,149 --> 02:07:05,741
without police noticing you.

1574
02:07:06,085 --> 02:07:08,883
I don't want your money or other
favours to go back to Mumbai.

1575
02:07:09,254 --> 02:07:12,052
If I want, chartered flight would
land at cochin airport.

1576
02:07:12,458 --> 02:07:14,824
And I will fly before the eyes of police.

1577
02:07:15,227 --> 02:07:19,027
I will not go back unless I get the
killer of George Kutty before me.

1578
02:07:19,665 --> 02:07:22,657
It is not to prove my innocence before

1579
02:07:22,901 --> 02:07:25,233
police but to convince my dad.

1580
02:07:25,371 --> 02:07:26,338
You..

1581
02:07:26,939 --> 02:07:28,270
My hand- gunner doesn't
remember that the man

1582
02:07:28,407 --> 02:07:31,274
standing before is a minister.

1583
02:07:51,163 --> 02:07:53,256
Can you give me that phone?

1584
02:07:54,700 --> 02:07:56,292
I want to call someone.

1585
02:07:58,570 --> 02:08:03,701
I don't have the freedom
to make a call even.

1586
02:08:06,612 --> 02:08:08,773
My father can only
hold my engagement.

1587
02:08:09,648 --> 02:08:11,081
But he will not be able to do
my marriage as per his wish.

1588
02:08:12,885 --> 02:08:16,981
I am in love with a guy

1589
02:08:19,491 --> 02:08:22,187
Can you give me that phone?

1590
02:08:23,729 --> 02:08:27,324
I don't use my phone for unwanted things.
I also don't give it to others.

1591
02:08:27,533 --> 02:08:29,000
Girl.. Don't you have any other job?

1592
02:08:29,902 --> 02:08:32,928
Okay, you keep your mobile with you

1593
02:08:34,373 --> 02:08:36,432
There is no one to love
you or wait foryou.

1594
02:08:36,709 --> 02:08:40,475
If you had, you wouldn't have
become a professional killer like this.

1595
02:08:44,550 --> 02:08:49,283
You don't understand the value of love.

1596
02:09:22,688 --> 02:09:25,282
Beholding each other,
the eyes build the

1597
02:09:25,557 --> 02:09:28,321
dream home of love,
in the bosoms,

1598
02:09:28,527 --> 02:09:33,965
Even the silence, so slowly
exchange love,

1599
02:09:34,066 --> 02:09:39,732
The sun glimmering on the
feathery dewdrops,

1600
02:09:39,905 --> 02:09:45,434
And together we mount
the chariot of love!

1601
02:09:45,544 --> 02:09:51,107
In lives innumerable,
In dreams umpteen,

1602
02:09:51,517 --> 02:09:57,478
And days overlong,
cherished I 'this moment'

1603
02:10:08,400 --> 02:10:11,028
Beholding each other,
the eyes build the

1604
02:10:11,270 --> 02:10:13,966
dream home of love,
in the bosoms,

1605
02:10:14,139 --> 02:10:20,374
Even the silence, so slowly
exchange love,

1606
02:10:49,608 --> 02:10:54,944
Of yore, in a faraway land,
lived a princess

1607
02:10:55,214 --> 02:11:00,584
who fell in love
with the minister's heir!

1608
02:11:01,086 --> 02:11:06,490
Not though the permission even to see,

1609
02:11:06,625 --> 02:11:11,289
Awaited she, with admiration.

1610
02:11:11,396 --> 02:11:17,232
All along the love-laden nights,
did she sit in meditation,

1611
02:11:17,736 --> 02:11:23,072
Praying for the loving
hearts to meet in unison.

1612
02:11:34,253 --> 02:11:36,813
Beholding each other,
the eyes build the

1613
02:11:36,922 --> 02:11:39,755
dream home of love,
in the bosoms,

1614
02:11:39,925 --> 02:11:46,160
Even the silence, so slowly
exchange love,

1615
02:11:52,437 --> 02:11:57,807
Inside the enchanting lake
of their first love

1616
02:11:58,243 --> 02:12:03,146
Together they roamed
as if a cool breeze.

1617
02:12:03,782 --> 02:12:09,277
And in the tempting
twilight of their love

1618
02:12:09,454 --> 02:12:13,914
Remained, with the loving
vermilion embellished.

1619
02:12:14,026 --> 02:12:16,961
In the night so passionate,

1620
02:12:17,095 --> 02:12:20,030
In the moments, so delightful,

1621
02:12:20,132 --> 02:12:23,499
In the nights so mellifluous,

1622
02:12:23,802 --> 02:12:25,997
They united in heart at their will!

1623
02:12:37,049 --> 02:12:39,609
Beholding each other,
the eyes build the

1624
02:12:39,952 --> 02:12:42,614
dream home of love,
in the bosoms,

1625
02:12:42,788 --> 02:12:48,351
Even the silence, so slowly
exchange love,

1626
02:12:48,627 --> 02:12:51,289
In lives innumerable,

1627
02:12:51,530 --> 02:12:54,090
In dreams umpteen,

1628
02:12:54,499 --> 02:12:56,592
And days overlong,

1629
02:12:56,768 --> 02:13:00,135
cherished I 'this moment'

1630
02:13:22,361 --> 02:13:25,296
I would n't have disbelieved you

1631
02:13:25,964 --> 02:13:28,194
even if people say you are wrong.

1632
02:13:29,067 --> 02:13:35,199
But if your brother-in-law said the same

1633
02:13:35,640 --> 02:13:37,870
I understood it as serious.

1634
02:13:38,677 --> 02:13:41,407
Any girl can understand such

1635
02:13:41,747 --> 02:13:43,271
mistakes arising out of situations.

1636
02:13:43,882 --> 02:13:44,940
But this is not..

1637
02:13:45,250 --> 02:13:51,189
My ailing parents are forcing
me for a marriage.

1638
02:13:51,590 --> 02:13:55,424
Probably they don't want me
to become a liability in their life.

1639
02:14:00,665 --> 02:14:05,364
Coming 27th is my engagement day.

1640
02:14:42,374 --> 02:14:44,137
Who are you?
What do you want?

1641
02:14:47,679 --> 02:14:48,703
I am Joji.

1642
02:14:48,914 --> 02:14:49,846
I am Home Minister's would be..

1643
02:14:49,948 --> 02:14:51,848
No.. Home Minister's wife's

1644
02:14:52,517 --> 02:14:53,484
Oh.. no.. I mean, his daughter's would be.

1645
02:14:53,685 --> 02:14:55,414
Minister's future son-in-law!

1646
02:14:55,821 --> 02:14:58,187
Hey.. please sit down!

1647
02:15:09,668 --> 02:15:11,693
No.. May I come in sir?

1648
02:15:17,642 --> 02:15:20,543
I am a matured bachelor.

1649
02:15:20,846 --> 02:15:25,044
I am in love with a matured girl!

1650
02:15:25,150 --> 02:15:27,311
Whether she is a spinster?

1651
02:15:27,452 --> 02:15:28,851
Now she is!

1652
02:15:28,954 --> 02:15:32,390
If police would not
intervene, she will marry.

1653
02:15:33,058 --> 02:15:35,492
And now she is in jail.
That's the highlight!

1654
02:15:36,561 --> 02:15:40,463
-ln jail?
-I mean house arrest.

1655
02:15:40,966 --> 02:15:43,457
They are mentally torturing her.

1656
02:15:43,702 --> 02:15:46,102
They are forcing herto
marry against her wish.

1657
02:15:46,271 --> 02:15:47,738
-What is name?
-Meenakshi..

1658
02:15:48,039 --> 02:15:49,939
-You are Meenakshi?
-Me..?

1659
02:15:50,242 --> 02:15:53,678
..I am Joji
Joji Varghese Mopila..

1660
02:15:53,845 --> 02:15:55,073
That's the highlight.

1661
02:15:56,248 --> 02:15:57,340
This is Joji.

1662
02:15:58,049 --> 02:15:59,380
My immediate elder brother..

1663
02:15:59,584 --> 02:16:01,711
He was studying for priesthood..

1664
02:16:04,022 --> 02:16:06,650
Now he has left the priest's cloak.

1665
02:16:07,926 --> 02:16:10,690
We are in love beyond separation.

1666
02:16:10,929 --> 02:16:12,726
Please don't separate us sir.

1667
02:16:18,170 --> 02:16:19,933
-What sir?
-Nothing..

1668
02:16:21,173 --> 02:16:22,504
If you find who the girl is,

1669
02:16:22,607 --> 02:16:24,404
then you will not be able
to laugh at me like this.

1670
02:16:24,543 --> 02:16:25,532
You will tremble..

1671
02:16:26,344 --> 02:16:28,676
You please don't disclose this
till our register marriage.

1672
02:16:28,780 --> 02:16:29,804
Will you disclose?

1673
02:16:30,715 --> 02:16:32,774
She is the only daughter
of the home minister.

1674
02:16:34,586 --> 02:16:35,211
What?

1675
02:16:35,353 --> 02:16:36,945
No, I was checking whether
your knees started shivering!

1676
02:16:37,055 --> 02:16:38,044
Don't fear, sir

1677
02:16:38,323 --> 02:16:39,813
If you stand by me now,

1678
02:16:40,158 --> 02:16:42,126
you would be benefited...

1679
02:16:43,061 --> 02:16:44,551
Anyway, I will marry her..

1680
02:16:44,696 --> 02:16:48,188
Before first night, that evening itself

1681
02:16:48,600 --> 02:16:54,061
We both will do the..

1682
02:16:54,339 --> 02:16:55,806
-What?
-Don't you understand?

1683
02:16:56,141 --> 02:16:57,165
Make her pregnant!

1684
02:16:57,943 --> 02:17:00,639
As he is going to be grand pa,
his objections will be off.

1685
02:17:00,745 --> 02:17:01,905
He would accept me.

1686
02:17:02,447 --> 02:17:06,440
Then I can do a lot of things for
you as the son-in-law of Minister.

1687
02:17:06,818 --> 02:17:09,013
Promotions.. transfers..
dismissal.. anything!

1688
02:17:09,287 --> 02:17:10,720
But that doesn't mean that I am

1689
02:17:10,989 --> 02:17:12,388
not going to give backhanderto you.

1690
02:17:12,791 --> 02:17:16,921
I should throw you in jail
for offering me bribe.

1691
02:17:17,429 --> 02:17:19,920
-That is the highlight.
-That's not highlight sir.

1692
02:17:20,031 --> 02:17:21,623
That will lose the
full light of my life.

1693
02:17:21,833 --> 02:17:23,494
I just said it on an excitement.

1694
02:17:23,602 --> 02:17:25,035
Please don't spoil the future
of the 'future' son-in-law

1695
02:17:25,170 --> 02:17:26,728
of the home minister.

1696
02:17:27,038 --> 02:17:30,235
In that case, let me ask the..

1697
02:17:30,375 --> 02:17:32,468
home minister about your protection.

1698
02:17:32,577 --> 02:17:33,544
No!

1699
02:17:34,112 --> 02:17:36,080
If they come to know about

1700
02:17:36,348 --> 02:17:40,648
the arrival of this cursed lover,
they will finish me off.

1701
02:17:41,286 --> 02:17:44,517
I have an offering that my
third son would be made..

1702
02:17:44,889 --> 02:17:49,223
a priest if our marriage happens.

1703
02:17:49,327 --> 02:17:51,056
You please make my offering happen.

1704
02:17:52,831 --> 02:17:54,059
Please help me out!

1705
02:17:54,299 --> 02:17:56,995
Consider me as a brother.
Protect me..

1706
02:17:57,168 --> 02:18:00,433
God bless you..

1707
02:18:01,706 --> 02:18:04,174
Why are you laughing, sir?

1708
02:18:05,510 --> 02:18:07,705
Are you deceiving me?

1709
02:18:17,088 --> 02:18:18,020
Jesus..

1710
02:18:18,290 --> 02:18:22,090
Please save me by stopping
dad from throwing me out.

1711
02:18:34,306 --> 02:18:35,671
Why are you here?

1712
02:18:40,345 --> 02:18:43,974
I don't know that Kerala police
is this much efficient.

1713
02:18:44,883 --> 02:18:47,909
I never thought my protection
would be taken care this fast.

1714
02:18:48,019 --> 02:18:49,384
That too directly by you!

1715
02:18:49,921 --> 02:18:51,513
You could have put
two local policemen.

1716
02:18:52,590 --> 02:18:56,287
Local police protection for future
son-in-law of home minister?

1717
02:18:56,494 --> 02:18:58,485
That equals dishonoring
our home minister.

1718
02:18:58,863 --> 02:18:59,727
Sir, don't say loudly.

1719
02:19:00,598 --> 02:19:03,192
But sir, there is no need of
protection inside the house.

1720
02:19:03,501 --> 02:19:04,934
We have ladies here.

1721
02:19:16,815 --> 02:19:18,680
Joji, where were you these days?

1722
02:19:18,850 --> 02:19:20,317
There was no information of yours.

1723
02:19:20,452 --> 02:19:21,783
Even you did not botherto call.

1724
02:19:21,953 --> 02:19:24,615
Nothing to say..
I was into some problems.

1725
02:19:24,789 --> 02:19:26,620
I heard you came here
a few days ago

1726
02:19:26,825 --> 02:19:29,453
-Why are you late?
-That is..

1727
02:19:30,395 --> 02:19:32,420
How can I come before dad
without the priest cloak?

1728
02:19:32,530 --> 02:19:34,191
What?

1729
02:19:34,566 --> 02:19:39,094
That is a secret between us.

1730
02:19:39,704 --> 02:19:40,728
No need for police to interfere.

1731
02:19:40,939 --> 02:19:43,305
This is a problem when we
allow police in house.

1732
02:19:43,408 --> 02:19:44,841
They look through
all unwanted things.

1733
02:19:45,543 --> 02:19:47,511
You go inside.
Sir you go out please.

1734
02:19:48,079 --> 02:19:49,239
What are you doing?

1735
02:19:50,014 --> 02:19:51,174
No body touching..

1736
02:19:51,583 --> 02:19:53,744
No relation with family..
I told you..

1737
02:19:54,986 --> 02:19:56,180
I will go after meeting Dad.

1738
02:19:56,287 --> 02:19:57,254
So he is not here..

1739
02:19:58,056 --> 02:20:00,991
In spite of that you got in..

1740
02:20:01,192 --> 02:20:02,682
I complain this to the Minister.

1741
02:20:03,294 --> 02:20:05,262
-He is the minister of my home.
-What?

1742
02:20:05,663 --> 02:20:07,927
He is my husband.
Look there.

1743
02:20:16,074 --> 02:20:18,907
-When did it happen?
-One and a half month before.

1744
02:20:21,446 --> 02:20:22,936
I would be the first brother
in the world who have no

1745
02:20:23,081 --> 02:20:24,446
idea of sister's marriage.

1746
02:20:24,582 --> 02:20:25,378
Sorry brother-in-law.

1747
02:20:25,683 --> 02:20:28,277
-lt is funny to see his situation.
-Do you know that?

1748
02:20:28,686 --> 02:20:32,486
He who went to become priest
is now father of children.

1749
02:20:33,458 --> 02:20:34,425
Dad has come

1750
02:20:34,559 --> 02:20:36,925
Don't scare me.
Oh God! Dad!

1751
02:20:37,162 --> 02:20:40,063
Please ensure that dad
never knows about my affair.

1752
02:20:51,609 --> 02:20:54,134
Dad.. come this side

1753
02:20:55,346 --> 02:20:58,611
God bless you!

1754
02:20:58,750 --> 02:21:02,516
Don't torture me dad..
I am grown without mother.

1755
02:21:02,654 --> 02:21:04,815
-You please not scold him.
-Yes..Yes..

1756
02:21:05,190 --> 02:21:07,715
-Actually dad, the reason is..
-I don't want any explanation.

1757
02:21:08,193 --> 02:21:11,060
I lately could understand that you
cannot force someone to become

1758
02:21:11,162 --> 02:21:14,290
a priest like doctor or an engineer.

1759
02:21:14,532 --> 02:21:17,296
-Forthat one needs the divine call.
-You are true.

1760
02:21:17,435 --> 02:21:19,562
That call was missing.
God cheated me.

1761
02:21:20,071 --> 02:21:23,598
If he were a priest, I would have
sympathized with the believers.

1762
02:21:23,775 --> 02:21:27,074
-Please read not bible in Pakistan.
-Kunjacha.. -What?

1763
02:21:27,846 --> 02:21:30,144
Before he gets us in more trouble,

1764
02:21:30,482 --> 02:21:33,280
-We have to arrange his marriage.
-I was about to tell that.

1765
02:21:33,651 --> 02:21:36,142
Chalissery Jacob's daughter is a nice girl.

1766
02:21:36,321 --> 02:21:39,017
She is getting good offers too

1767
02:21:39,123 --> 02:21:42,957
Yes, she is good.
Also a God fearing family..

1768
02:21:43,061 --> 02:21:47,088
-You inform them that we
are coming for an alliance. -Ok.

1769
02:21:50,034 --> 02:21:53,629
I am getting into more trouble.

1770
02:21:54,339 --> 02:21:59,242
Don't take revenge on me
as I jumped seminary.

1771
02:21:59,477 --> 02:22:02,503
If you want to get out of
this mess, tell dad the facts.

1772
02:22:04,315 --> 02:22:06,510
I thought it was you, Mother Mary

1773
02:22:06,818 --> 02:22:07,910
How can I say?

1774
02:22:08,520 --> 02:22:11,421
He is keeping the displeasure
on me for leaving seminary.

1775
02:22:11,523 --> 02:22:14,788
Moreover if he comes to know
about my relation with hindu girl!

1776
02:22:14,926 --> 02:22:17,224
Is that relation serious?

1777
02:22:17,328 --> 02:22:20,957
Jesus made that relation grow high.

1778
02:22:21,566 --> 02:22:24,933
Let dad know this after
my register marriage.

1779
02:22:29,173 --> 02:22:31,437
But this will happen only if
Meenakshi manages to

1780
02:22:31,576 --> 02:22:32,668
flee from her home.

1781
02:22:32,844 --> 02:22:34,402
Hey priest..

1782
02:22:35,480 --> 02:22:37,471
If she comes out on your call,

1783
02:22:37,649 --> 02:22:40,277
we will take her along
fighting them.

1784
02:22:41,719 --> 02:22:46,019
Jesus.. Are you in my
brother-in-law's shape?

1785
02:22:58,303 --> 02:22:59,235
Come!

1786
02:23:01,873 --> 02:23:04,103
-To see Minister..
-Yes.

1787
02:23:04,208 --> 02:23:08,645
Inside betrothal of his
daughter is taking place.

1788
02:23:15,086 --> 02:23:16,485
It is a happy moment

1789
02:23:17,388 --> 02:23:19,185
It is time up for the
Auspicious moment

1790
02:23:20,091 --> 02:23:22,787
-We can now exchange horoscopes.
-Yes.

1791
02:23:24,963 --> 02:23:26,260
We are in the middle of a function.

1792
02:23:26,364 --> 02:23:27,490
Official things only after that.

1793
02:23:27,865 --> 02:23:31,926
I came to discuss an issue
related to this function.

1794
02:23:33,037 --> 02:23:35,437
This is Joji.
He has lodged a complaint.

1795
02:23:35,807 --> 02:23:40,335
The complaint says that he is
in love with your daughter.

1796
02:23:45,350 --> 02:23:47,910
Many scoundrels like him have
liking towards my daughter.

1797
02:23:48,252 --> 02:23:49,310
What is your interest in this?

1798
02:23:49,420 --> 02:23:51,945
If she also has that liking
towards him then your

1799
02:23:52,323 --> 02:23:54,416
betrothal would go waste.

1800
02:23:54,559 --> 02:23:55,890
My daughter has no such affair.

1801
02:23:55,994 --> 02:23:58,986
-That is to be stated by your daughter.
-You wicked..

1802
02:23:59,163 --> 02:24:00,960
You don't wish to have
the cap on your head?

1803
02:24:01,099 --> 02:24:02,760
Stay aside, rascal..

1804
02:24:02,934 --> 02:24:06,893
You sm ugglers and illicit liquor
marketers should keep at least

1805
02:24:07,105 --> 02:24:08,697
two foot distance from an lPs officer.

1806
02:24:09,007 --> 02:24:12,204
Wheneveryou find time,
tell your brothers who Vadakkan is!

1807
02:24:12,310 --> 02:24:15,541
Joseph, this is the betrothal
of the Minister's daughter.

1808
02:24:15,647 --> 02:24:17,672
-Don't create an issue!
-I am very sorry sir.

1809
02:24:17,882 --> 02:24:19,747
I need to enquire on the complaint.

1810
02:24:19,951 --> 02:24:22,715
Habeas corpus is issued by court.

1811
02:24:23,121 --> 02:24:26,022
Come. Call her..

1812
02:24:30,595 --> 02:24:33,086
You cannot do this at my home.
Beat him out of the house..

1813
02:24:34,565 --> 02:24:35,725
Beat him out of the house..

1814
02:24:36,601 --> 02:24:37,659
-Come
-Leave me!

1815
02:24:45,076 --> 02:24:47,271
Come, Meenakshi!

1816
02:24:47,545 --> 02:24:48,773
Get out!

1817
02:24:50,348 --> 02:24:52,043
I said to come.

1818
02:25:12,136 --> 02:25:13,296
Brother..

1819
02:25:14,005 --> 02:25:18,465
Who has the guts to hit my brother Joji?

1820
02:25:54,278 --> 02:25:55,370
Brother!

1821
02:25:59,851 --> 02:26:01,716
-Do you like him?
-Yes..

1822
02:26:01,819 --> 02:26:04,583
-Are you willing to live with him?
-Yes.

1823
02:26:05,022 --> 02:26:05,954
Her engagement with Joji is hereby done.

1824
02:26:06,090 --> 02:26:09,457
Take her in the vehicle.
Let me see who dares to stop?

1825
02:26:09,761 --> 02:26:11,592
Vadakkan.. beware..

1826
02:26:11,963 --> 02:26:14,932
You will pay a heavy price for this

1827
02:26:15,299 --> 02:26:16,664
drama you played with the accused.

1828
02:26:18,603 --> 02:26:19,570
You see this.

1829
02:26:20,037 --> 02:26:22,096
Anticipatory bail issued by supreme court.

1830
02:26:22,206 --> 02:26:23,605
Number one advocate of supreme court

1831
02:26:23,708 --> 02:26:25,198
Mr. Krishna Dev lyer has appeared for me.

1832
02:26:25,510 --> 02:26:29,037
I e-mailed this to
the investigating officer Joseph

1833
02:26:29,147 --> 02:26:30,375
Vadakkan the moment I received it.

1834
02:26:30,548 --> 02:26:33,540
I have grip not only here
but at Delhi too.

1835
02:26:35,219 --> 02:26:37,449
Harihar.. I am reminding you
one more time

1836
02:26:37,822 --> 02:26:39,915
I will not go back unless I get to

1837
02:26:40,024 --> 02:26:40,922
see the killer of George Kutty.

1838
02:26:41,092 --> 02:26:43,151
I would follow you
like your shadow.

1839
02:26:44,462 --> 02:26:45,451
Come!

1840
02:26:45,830 --> 02:26:48,060
Brother in law, come and
get into the vehicle.

1841
02:26:59,610 --> 02:27:02,704
Joji is coming here
with the Minister's daughter

1842
02:27:03,181 --> 02:27:04,773
I would not allow them
to touch feet here.

1843
02:27:05,016 --> 02:27:06,813
-You go and close the door.
-Ok.

1844
02:27:10,555 --> 02:27:13,217
A son supposed to be a priest!
Now he has abducted a girl..

1845
02:27:13,825 --> 02:27:16,157
Supporting him is the Mumbai goon.

1846
02:27:16,460 --> 02:27:20,658
Jesus.. What would I be facing
in the name of this?

1847
02:27:25,236 --> 02:27:28,569
I never expected this kind
of support from you to him.

1848
02:27:30,708 --> 02:27:34,235
I did not consider you as a
son-in-law but a real son!

1849
02:27:34,679 --> 02:27:37,045
Do you think it's fair to keep

1850
02:27:37,248 --> 02:27:40,775
son in law in place of your sons?

1851
02:27:40,885 --> 02:27:41,852
That's my fate.

1852
02:27:42,553 --> 02:27:45,113
Before you blame your fate,
let me ask you one thing..

1853
02:27:45,289 --> 02:27:47,120
What wrong did Joji do?

1854
02:27:47,291 --> 02:27:48,781
Loving a girl?

1855
02:27:49,493 --> 02:27:53,793
It is manliness that
makes him do so.

1856
02:27:54,532 --> 02:27:55,521
Come to Christy..

1857
02:27:55,900 --> 02:27:59,666
He is being framed in those murder cases.

1858
02:27:59,871 --> 02:28:03,307
As the investigating officer of
George Kutty murder case,

1859
02:28:03,441 --> 02:28:04,999
I can say he is innocent.

1860
02:28:09,146 --> 02:28:12,309
These are the records of Mumbai
police about George Kutty.

1861
02:28:14,085 --> 02:28:17,316
George Kutty who came to Mumbai in 1 990

1862
02:28:17,421 --> 02:28:20,015
has thirty odd cases registered on him.

1863
02:28:20,124 --> 02:28:22,649
These records refer to sex racketing,
narcotics, hooliganism etc..

1864
02:28:22,827 --> 02:28:27,093
This file has proof that
Christy was a victim to George's deceit

1865
02:28:32,503 --> 02:28:38,669
No doubt..
He is behind Jessy murder too.

1866
02:28:40,111 --> 02:28:41,840
Dad you made the mistake.

1867
02:28:41,946 --> 02:28:44,608
You blindly believed George Kutty.

1868
02:28:45,783 --> 02:28:49,480
If Christy was given a chance to
tell the truth and prove..

1869
02:28:49,720 --> 02:28:52,621
he would have been here with you.

1870
02:28:53,491 --> 02:28:56,654
You told me at least a hundred

1871
02:28:56,761 --> 02:28:59,195
times that the new house built by
Christy has the smell of blood.

1872
02:28:59,697 --> 02:29:02,791
But I see that money a reward
for doing things forthe

1873
02:29:02,900 --> 02:29:06,336
Government and political bigwigs

1874
02:29:06,437 --> 02:29:08,405
in real life threatening situations.

1875
02:29:09,840 --> 02:29:11,603
That house is his savings.

1876
02:29:12,677 --> 02:29:18,013
Dad.. we have only one life before us.

1877
02:29:18,115 --> 02:29:19,173
You need to love.

1878
02:29:19,483 --> 02:29:25,888
Love your children.
They long forthat..

1879
02:29:31,062 --> 02:29:32,757
Christy will bring Joji and
Meenakshi here tomorrow..

1880
02:29:32,863 --> 02:29:34,990
..aftertheir marriage registration

1881
02:29:35,299 --> 02:29:38,097
If you like you can accept them.

1882
02:29:38,202 --> 02:29:41,501
Otherwise they would go to
Mumbai with Christy.

1883
02:29:42,039 --> 02:29:42,971
Come!

1884
02:30:12,269 --> 02:30:15,466
As an army man, he is stubborn.

1885
02:30:15,573 --> 02:30:17,837
Meenakshi, don't expect an
early reception from him.

1886
02:30:17,942 --> 02:30:18,806
Come

1887
02:30:20,644 --> 02:30:22,578
I am not allowed to come further.

1888
02:30:22,680 --> 02:30:25,205
I'll wait for the results here.

1889
02:30:35,059 --> 02:30:36,287
Why are you laughing?

1890
02:30:36,594 --> 02:30:40,223
I see the priest coming
with an abducted girl!

1891
02:30:40,664 --> 02:30:41,494
See his imagination

1892
02:31:07,291 --> 02:31:09,350
-Go!
-Come

1893
02:31:19,470 --> 02:31:23,930
Dad, I should have become a priest.
But this happened.

1894
02:31:25,209 --> 02:31:28,110
We need your blessings.

1895
02:31:29,180 --> 02:31:30,670
Please bless us

1896
02:31:30,781 --> 02:31:34,342
Look, she is waiting

1897
02:31:34,652 --> 02:31:36,415
She is a nice girl

1898
02:31:39,657 --> 02:31:41,090
It's all God's wish.

1899
02:31:41,892 --> 02:31:43,018
May God bless you

1900
02:31:51,335 --> 02:31:52,324
Stop there you..

1901
02:31:54,071 --> 02:31:55,561
Where are you going?

1902
02:31:58,609 --> 02:31:59,576
You come here.

1903
02:32:03,080 --> 02:32:04,069
You come here

1904
02:32:13,557 --> 02:32:18,290
I wanted my son in law's
help to understand you.

1905
02:32:23,601 --> 02:32:26,729
You forgive me for
all that happened..

1906
02:32:39,083 --> 02:32:39,947
Brother..

1907
02:32:41,185 --> 02:32:44,677
It is the auspiciousness of
the new girl at home.

1908
02:32:45,422 --> 02:32:49,188
The priest has used the
opportunity to praise his wife..

1909
02:32:51,662 --> 02:32:52,720
Now you can go back.

1910
02:33:10,781 --> 02:33:14,046
They stood my left and right
forthe last three four years.

1911
02:33:14,151 --> 02:33:15,948
Then why did you ask them to leave?

1912
02:33:16,487 --> 02:33:21,015
Now I want to be your left
and right for some time.

1913
02:33:24,328 --> 02:33:25,260
Come

1914
02:33:39,510 --> 02:33:40,442
Hello brother..

1915
02:33:41,512 --> 02:33:43,503
I am in Cochin now.

1916
02:33:43,948 --> 02:33:46,075
My work in Kerala is over.

1917
02:33:46,717 --> 02:33:49,117
I am leaving in tomorrow
morning flight.

1918
02:33:49,220 --> 02:33:52,485
Before you go, find time
to come to my home.

1919
02:33:52,590 --> 02:33:54,524
-Where? Home..
-Yes.

1920
02:33:54,692 --> 02:33:57,388
That one in 'wonders of world' happened.

1921
02:33:58,462 --> 02:34:00,794
My father could finally recognize me.

1922
02:34:04,235 --> 02:34:05,224
Another thing.

1923
02:34:05,336 --> 02:34:10,740
My brother Joji married
home minister's daughter.

1924
02:34:10,841 --> 02:34:12,741
I would definitely come then.

1925
02:34:13,043 --> 02:34:14,135
Tonight we meet.

1926
02:34:17,781 --> 02:34:20,079
-Who is that?
-Andrews..

1927
02:34:20,384 --> 02:34:23,615
I met Andrews first at Mumbai Jail.

1928
02:34:27,891 --> 02:34:29,791
He was Karim Lala then.

1929
02:34:30,928 --> 02:34:35,365
Actually it can be
said as my rebirth.

1930
02:34:42,406 --> 02:34:46,365
I am Karim Lala.

1931
02:34:47,678 --> 02:34:49,771
My original name is Andrews.

1932
02:34:50,314 --> 02:34:53,408
My close friends
call me by that name.

1933
02:34:53,517 --> 02:34:54,745
Why did you come to see me?

1934
02:34:54,852 --> 02:34:57,650
I just wanted to meet you.
Also I wish you to join my team.

1935
02:34:59,023 --> 02:35:04,552
Enemy's enemy is friend.
I am George Kutty's enemy.

1936
02:35:05,362 --> 02:35:09,298
I have done the job to
set you out from here.

1937
02:35:09,466 --> 02:35:14,836
But one condition..
I want George Kutty.

1938
02:35:16,173 --> 02:35:19,973
I suffered big losses due to him.

1939
02:35:20,711 --> 02:35:24,545
His death will be at my hands.

1940
02:35:26,116 --> 02:35:30,416
You mean to say Andrews
killed George Kutty?

1941
02:35:30,521 --> 02:35:31,453
No.

1942
02:35:32,222 --> 02:35:34,486
He was killed before Andrews arrived.

1943
02:35:34,591 --> 02:35:38,527
Do we need CBl to prove this case?

1944
02:35:39,430 --> 02:35:43,298
No case under me has
so far gone above..

1945
02:35:43,701 --> 02:35:50,163
I will find his killer.

1946
02:35:50,274 --> 02:35:51,832
That's you.

1947
02:35:52,576 --> 02:35:57,639
Anyway, don't forget to
make your third son a priest.

1948
02:35:59,416 --> 02:36:01,281
Let's stop with 2 children

1949
02:36:06,490 --> 02:36:07,855
You just say 'Go ahead'.

1950
02:36:07,958 --> 02:36:11,621
My children will bring Meenakshi
here without the knowledge of

1951
02:36:11,762 --> 02:36:14,322
police even, devastating their family.

1952
02:36:14,431 --> 02:36:15,420
No.. that's not clever.

1953
02:36:16,033 --> 02:36:19,969
If he or she shed tears in front of media,
then the opposition parties will

1954
02:36:20,070 --> 02:36:21,162
not sit back quietly.

1955
02:36:21,271 --> 02:36:23,466
Even my party would not
support me in such a situation.

1956
02:36:23,607 --> 02:36:25,666
Why should we create
a situation for me to resign?

1957
02:36:25,776 --> 02:36:26,708
No. That's not needed.

1958
02:36:26,810 --> 02:36:31,543
If your minister's berth is gone,
then our projects would collapse.

1959
02:36:31,648 --> 02:36:32,580
You shut up..

1960
02:36:32,683 --> 02:36:33,707
Let me speak.

1961
02:36:34,918 --> 02:36:37,284
You call a press meet and announce

1962
02:36:37,388 --> 02:36:39,515
that you have no issues with

1963
02:36:39,790 --> 02:36:41,314
either religion or caste and hence

1964
02:36:41,458 --> 02:36:45,189
accept the marriage of your daughter.

1965
02:36:45,295 --> 02:36:47,058
Meantime, we would take care

1966
02:36:47,164 --> 02:36:50,361
of Joji without any hue and cry.

1967
02:36:50,534 --> 02:36:51,523
What about my daughterthen?

1968
02:36:51,668 --> 02:36:54,398
We don't have any problem
that she married once.

1969
02:36:54,505 --> 02:36:57,770
My soon Harihar likes her very much.

1970
02:36:57,875 --> 02:37:00,207
You leave the things to me..

1971
02:37:00,344 --> 02:37:02,073
I'll take care of
rest of the things

1972
02:37:07,017 --> 02:37:11,249
When minister goes there to invite
his daughter and son in law..

1973
02:37:11,388 --> 02:37:14,619
Joji should not be in this world!
You understand?

1974
02:37:16,860 --> 02:37:18,794
-Dad.. -What is it?
-Our lawyer has conveyed that..

1975
02:37:18,896 --> 02:37:20,659
Varghese Mopila may hand over
the original docs before the

1976
02:37:20,764 --> 02:37:22,026
commission in Munnar land case.

1977
02:37:22,166 --> 02:37:24,760
That will create problem for us..

1978
02:37:25,102 --> 02:37:28,196
-I picked up their manager Kunjachan.
-Then?

1979
02:37:28,338 --> 02:37:30,772
A case of possession of drugs
has also been charged on him.

1980
02:37:30,874 --> 02:37:31,772
Where is he?

1981
02:37:33,610 --> 02:37:34,770
Move

1982
02:37:36,413 --> 02:37:40,213
Tell me in which locker did
they keep the title deeds?

1983
02:37:40,651 --> 02:37:45,782
Tell the truth otherwise Damodar
would handle you his way.

1984
02:37:45,956 --> 02:37:48,891
-Tell..
-Please don't torture me..

1985
02:37:48,992 --> 02:37:52,928
Don't file any case against me
I'll tell you.

1986
02:37:53,530 --> 02:37:58,229
The title deeds are not in bank locker.

1987
02:37:58,335 --> 02:38:00,997
It is kept in the iron safe
in Palamattom house.

1988
02:38:01,405 --> 02:38:05,432
We need to rinse out
Palamattom house then..

1989
02:38:08,879 --> 02:38:10,210
Why this is all dragged out?

1990
02:38:10,314 --> 02:38:11,440
Everything of this is belongs to Joji.

1991
02:38:11,548 --> 02:38:13,277
I am taking this to his
room in the new house.

1992
02:38:13,383 --> 02:38:16,409
-Sorry.. I'll just clear it off.
-No.. No.. Let me also help.

1993
02:38:18,755 --> 02:38:20,586
See his passport.

1994
02:38:20,724 --> 02:38:24,387
He is handling things very silly.

1995
02:38:28,799 --> 02:38:31,063
Oh. It's a duplicate copy.

1996
02:38:34,404 --> 02:38:37,840
It is 5 months and 14 days since
he reached, as in the passport.

1997
02:38:37,941 --> 02:38:39,374
Where was he all these days?

1998
02:38:39,476 --> 02:38:42,070
Oh.. you started the
police man's exercise!

1999
02:38:42,179 --> 02:38:43,737
Okay, I'll go to the kitchen

2000
02:38:50,954 --> 02:38:54,048
We've to call the priest and
do house warming for he new house

2001
02:38:54,157 --> 02:38:56,887
I am shifting into that house

2002
02:38:56,994 --> 02:38:59,326
It is enough for me till my life ends

2003
02:39:05,235 --> 02:39:07,066
I have a serious matter to discuss.

2004
02:39:07,671 --> 02:39:10,572
I am in your new house.

2005
02:39:13,577 --> 02:39:14,737
You just come here.

2006
02:39:15,279 --> 02:39:16,405
Don't let dad know..

2007
02:39:16,713 --> 02:39:17,805
You come alone.

2008
02:39:21,985 --> 02:39:22,849
What?

2009
02:39:33,363 --> 02:39:34,295
What is the matter?

2010
02:39:34,598 --> 02:39:37,465
I have identified George Kutty's killer.

2011
02:39:39,603 --> 02:39:40,695
Look at this!

2012
02:39:41,138 --> 02:39:42,571
Joji's passport!

2013
02:39:48,211 --> 02:39:53,205
Joji arrived on 2.09.201 0,
the same

2014
02:39:53,317 --> 02:39:56,514
day of George Kutty's death.

2015
02:40:02,492 --> 02:40:03,356
See this..

2016
02:40:03,594 --> 02:40:05,585
I got it from Joji's bag.

2017
02:40:16,206 --> 02:40:18,572
This is the money handed over
to George Kutty by Christy.

2018
02:40:19,676 --> 02:40:24,375
The serial number of the currency
is noted in police records.

2019
02:40:25,449 --> 02:40:28,418
This is also found from Joji's bag.

2020
02:40:29,586 --> 02:40:30,575
Joji?

2021
02:40:31,054 --> 02:40:34,455
Yes. It is Joji who killed George Kutty.

2022
02:40:34,558 --> 02:40:35,490
What are you saying?

2023
02:40:35,592 --> 02:40:39,722
-lt was a planned murder.
-No.. he could not be.

2024
02:40:39,830 --> 02:40:41,320
-I will ask him.
-No.

2025
02:40:41,431 --> 02:40:43,331
I was questioning him.

2026
02:40:43,634 --> 02:40:44,931
He is here only.

2027
02:40:54,745 --> 02:40:57,111
Why did you kill George Kutty?

2028
02:40:58,649 --> 02:40:59,911
You wanted this money?

2029
02:41:00,884 --> 02:41:02,511
Or else anything did he do to Meenakshi?

2030
02:41:02,619 --> 02:41:03,551
No I did not.

2031
02:41:04,988 --> 02:41:05,920
I did not kill.

2032
02:41:06,023 --> 02:41:08,150
You.. telling lie.

2033
02:41:09,092 --> 02:41:10,582
You should not trouble
him without knowing facts.

2034
02:41:10,694 --> 02:41:13,219
-I would not allow that.
-Police know how to prove guilty.

2035
02:41:13,363 --> 02:41:14,330
I will..

2036
02:41:23,507 --> 02:41:27,876
You should not on my issue.

2037
02:41:29,813 --> 02:41:33,044
I'll tell you everything

2038
02:41:34,484 --> 02:41:37,453
I'll tell you what happened.

2039
02:41:51,668 --> 02:41:53,465
Brother-in-law..
Where are you?

2040
02:41:53,704 --> 02:41:54,728
I am in cochin.

2041
02:41:55,038 --> 02:41:57,063
I need your help.

2042
02:41:57,174 --> 02:41:59,699
-I told you earlier about Meenakshi.
-Yes..

2043
02:41:59,810 --> 02:42:01,243
Our home minister's daughter!

2044
02:42:01,344 --> 02:42:03,505
They came to know
about our relation.

2045
02:42:03,613 --> 02:42:04,477
Then..

2046
02:42:04,581 --> 02:42:07,778
They packed herfrom here.

2047
02:42:07,884 --> 02:42:09,875
Their people burned off my passport.

2048
02:42:09,986 --> 02:42:12,011
It would take at least one
week for the new passport

2049
02:42:12,122 --> 02:42:13,680
as informed by high Commission.

2050
02:42:13,790 --> 02:42:16,088
Meeenakshi should not
reach home from airport.

2051
02:42:16,193 --> 02:42:18,627
If she reaches, they
will make us apart.

2052
02:42:19,629 --> 02:42:21,597
If you tell herthe details,
she will understand.

2053
02:42:21,798 --> 02:42:24,596
Make use of Martin's
old building for her stay.

2054
02:42:24,835 --> 02:42:30,330
George Kutty had cheated me.
I mistook him as a good man.

2055
02:42:30,841 --> 02:42:34,937
I never thought
he would bargain with her.

2056
02:42:35,879 --> 02:42:38,677
I reached there that day..

2057
02:42:38,815 --> 02:42:42,182
The same day Christy reached there
to rescue her

2058
02:42:52,896 --> 02:42:53,760
Listen to me

2059
02:42:53,964 --> 02:42:57,798
Her dad can give any ransom
we want. Join me.

2060
02:42:58,335 --> 02:43:00,701
You can too share
this girl and money

2061
02:43:31,201 --> 02:43:34,534
Oh.. you came this early.

2062
02:43:34,604 --> 02:43:38,506
I looked upon you in the position
of my brother Christy.

2063
02:43:38,842 --> 02:43:41,936
But you chose to bargain with Meenakshi!

2064
02:43:43,580 --> 02:43:45,343
But that was..

2065
02:43:45,582 --> 02:43:49,074
We should not fight an issue over a girl.

2066
02:43:49,186 --> 02:43:50,551
If one goes the other comes.
That is my policy.

2067
02:43:50,654 --> 02:43:52,554
For me women are not an issue.

2068
02:43:52,656 --> 02:43:56,057
I could have made a lot of money
with that minister's daughter.

2069
02:43:56,193 --> 02:43:58,286
But your brother Christy
spoiled everything.

2070
02:43:58,395 --> 02:44:00,590
-She was my key to fortune.
-You damn!

2071
02:44:03,700 --> 02:44:05,292
You don't know me..

2072
02:44:05,402 --> 02:44:08,269
See this.. 10 million

2073
02:44:08,438 --> 02:44:11,839
I made money from the
business of flesh trade.

2074
02:44:11,942 --> 02:44:15,571
So what my brother told
about you were correct?

2075
02:44:15,846 --> 02:44:17,780
You were behind all our troubles..

2076
02:44:17,881 --> 02:44:20,406
You are right.
When I offered your sister to a

2077
02:44:20,517 --> 02:44:25,045
Marwari business man,
good money came to my hands.

2078
02:44:29,392 --> 02:44:31,485
You bloody..

2079
02:44:31,728 --> 02:44:33,719
You killed my sister..

2080
02:44:43,840 --> 02:44:46,172
Yes.. I killed Jessy.

2081
02:44:46,977 --> 02:44:49,844
If you turn against me,
I'll kill you also.

2082
02:44:53,250 --> 02:44:55,775
You devastated our family!

2083
02:44:58,889 --> 02:45:01,653
You distanced our brother from ourfamily.

2084
02:45:04,561 --> 02:45:06,620
You killed my sister!

2085
02:45:09,032 --> 02:45:11,262
The minimum punishment
foryou would be death.

2086
02:45:29,152 --> 02:45:32,747
We lost Jessy because of him.

2087
02:45:34,224 --> 02:45:35,885
How could I control myself?

2088
02:45:37,294 --> 02:45:39,558
Things went out of my control

2089
02:45:46,303 --> 02:45:49,898
I would have done the
same thing in his position.

2090
02:45:54,577 --> 02:46:00,379
What would we say
Meenakshi about this?

2091
02:46:01,985 --> 02:46:07,287
How can dad withstand
this if we tell him?

2092
02:46:14,531 --> 02:46:17,523
I know you are a
honest police officer.

2093
02:46:18,568 --> 02:46:21,799
I was the culprit before
police in this case so far.

2094
02:46:22,172 --> 02:46:23,662
Let it remain.

2095
02:46:23,974 --> 02:46:26,966
-I can accept the
charge in any court. -Brother!

2096
02:46:27,377 --> 02:46:28,639
You please leave Joji.

2097
02:46:29,245 --> 02:46:30,473
We need to save him for our

2098
02:46:30,647 --> 02:46:33,275
family and also for the girl

2099
02:46:34,150 --> 02:46:36,983
who came out trusting him.

2100
02:47:38,848 --> 02:47:39,872
Who is that?

2101
02:47:42,886 --> 02:47:44,376
Catch him.

2102
02:47:47,757 --> 02:47:50,749
Break it fast

2103
02:47:51,494 --> 02:47:52,927
Open it.

2104
02:47:55,565 --> 02:47:58,261
Open it.

2105
02:48:04,574 --> 02:48:06,132
My Kochu Thoma gave me these docs.

2106
02:48:06,276 --> 02:48:07,675
I will not give even if I die.

2107
02:48:09,679 --> 02:48:11,146
Since he has seen us,

2108
02:48:11,247 --> 02:48:13,511
Let us send him near Kochu Thoma.

2109
02:48:17,554 --> 02:48:20,819
- Dad, somebody is coming
-Get lost.

2110
02:48:25,795 --> 02:48:27,194
Christy my son..

2111
02:48:33,303 --> 02:48:35,897
Dad.. Oh God!

2112
02:48:36,806 --> 02:48:37,773
Dad, come.

2113
02:48:38,975 --> 02:48:42,069
-Start the vehicle.
-Get into the vehicle, fast.

2114
02:48:48,118 --> 02:48:53,454
-Our dad..
-Dad!

2115
02:48:57,894 --> 02:48:58,826
Dad!

2116
02:49:05,768 --> 02:49:10,569
Don't punish my dad for my mistakes.

2117
02:49:17,480 --> 02:49:20,415
-How is dad now?
-We did whatever we can do.

2118
02:49:20,650 --> 02:49:23,278
He is put on ventilator.

2119
02:49:38,735 --> 02:49:42,227
They did this.
Thampy and Children..

2120
02:49:42,372 --> 02:49:47,639
They killed our Kochu Thoma.

2121
02:50:02,392 --> 02:50:03,950
Don't stop me.

2122
02:50:04,093 --> 02:50:06,493
-Police would be with you.
-I don't want police support.

2123
02:50:06,729 --> 02:50:08,492
Then I'll come along.

2124
02:50:10,767 --> 02:50:15,397
He considered me as a
son not a son-in-law.

2125
02:50:15,772 --> 02:50:17,535
I'll come with you

2126
02:51:28,845 --> 02:51:31,678
-You are Chrity's..
-Brother.. Joji.

2127
02:51:32,215 --> 02:51:33,239
Joji..

2128
02:52:36,579 --> 02:52:38,604
-Now I feel relieved.
-Yes.

2129
02:52:38,848 --> 02:52:40,247
Keep it safe..

2130
02:52:41,451 --> 02:52:43,715
If Mopila recovers..

2131
02:52:43,953 --> 02:52:45,921
..and testifies,
won't we get caught?

2132
02:52:47,924 --> 02:52:50,859
Are you sure that Mopila
is going to die?

2133
02:52:50,993 --> 02:52:52,153
Sure

2134
02:52:53,062 --> 02:52:55,394
He is yet to open his mouth.
He is in coma!

2135
02:52:55,498 --> 02:52:57,523
If there is no ventilator support,
he'll die instantly.

2136
02:52:58,167 --> 02:52:59,464
To dupe some land we

2137
02:52:59,569 --> 02:53:02,129
had to chop off two
men from this world.

2138
02:53:02,372 --> 02:53:03,930
That's all..

2139
02:53:06,509 --> 02:53:09,910
-Murugan's team has come..
-Call them here.

2140
02:53:14,083 --> 02:53:15,311
Ask him to come inside.

2141
02:53:28,898 --> 02:53:30,297
Dad.. Christy..

2142
02:56:29,045 --> 02:56:34,039
-You fired at my beloved dad..
-Oh God!

2143
02:56:40,222 --> 02:56:41,348
Please don't do anything
to hurt my dad.

2144
02:56:42,491 --> 02:56:43,685
I will do anything.

2145
02:56:45,962 --> 02:56:47,156
Take your title deeds..

2146
02:56:47,463 --> 02:56:49,590
I would withdraw all cases
charged against you.

2147
02:56:51,701 --> 02:56:52,929
Don't do anything.

2148
02:57:27,870 --> 02:57:32,500
You made all wealth foryour
sons robbing and killing.

2149
02:57:33,542 --> 02:57:36,909
You punishment is to
see their dead faces!

2150
02:57:54,330 --> 02:57:56,230
It is dangerous now to
stay back here.

2151
02:57:56,499 --> 02:57:58,160
You need to surrender
before the police.

2152
02:57:58,300 --> 02:58:00,063
Betteryou come with me.
You'll be safe there in Mumbai.

2153
02:58:00,202 --> 02:58:03,638
No I don't mind getting
punished for what I did.

2154
02:58:04,774 --> 02:58:06,969
You can arrest me.

2155
02:58:07,343 --> 02:58:10,437
-But Christy, you did not do it alone..
-No.

2156
02:58:11,447 --> 02:58:14,439
Joseph, you should be there in

2157
02:58:14,550 --> 02:58:15,778
my position at Palamattom family.

2158
02:58:16,686 --> 02:58:19,883
-As the big brother to my siblings
-Brother..

2159
02:58:22,792 --> 02:58:23,884
Brother..

2160
02:58:35,905 --> 02:58:37,429
Some old men are like this.

2161
02:58:37,606 --> 02:58:40,439
They yearn and get
what they deserve..
