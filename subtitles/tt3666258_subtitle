2
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:02,375
Devanand.

3
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:04,416
Come here.

4
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:05,833
What is this?

5
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:07,791
Coffee plant

6
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:09,125
and below that?

7
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:11,291
Earth.

8
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:14,125
Like the way a plant is connected to earth.

9
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:17,708
Similarly a Kodava (NATIVES)
is connected to their roots

10
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:22,708
Dev, our land is our identity.

11
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,541
Does this all belong to us?

12
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:26,208
It belongs to me, your father

13
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:28,541
after that it is yours.

14
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:33,291
We serve it, we worship it.

15
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:35,541
Only then does it yield.

16
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:38,375
Once you grow up, you will understand.

17
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:42,041
Don't grow up. Stay my little boy.

18
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:43,958
Why?

19
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:45,291
Come here, see this plant.

20
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:47,958
We will take care of this
little coffee plant...

21
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:54,958
protect it from worms, from the hot sun.

22
00:01:55,458 --> 00:02:01,916
Then it will grow and bear flowers.

23
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:05,375
We call it the Bloom.

24
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,625
The color of the Bloom decides...

25
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:14,625
whether the plant will grow coffee.

26
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:21,416
If the flower turns out to
be pink, everything is lost.

27
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:25,416
So with growing up comes its share of pain.

28
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,750
Not this, I am not liking this..

29
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,708
It's good right?

30
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:28,750
No, Lets ask Dev, What
should we name our house?

31
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,500
Thaa Mane.

32
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Really.

33
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,000
My darling

34
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:42,666
Dev.

35
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:45,750
Don't cycle near the well..

36
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,208
You will fall inside.

37
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:52,208
This time I won't pull your out...

38
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:07,375
Aaa! Aaaa! Aaa!

39
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,500
Damaged the gate.

40
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,750
Crashed into a bloody tree this time!

41
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,916
Birju (ELEPHANT) has been
gate crashing a lot recently.

42
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,291
Lever is damaged.

43
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,250
You should stop drinking sir.

44
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,666
Moron!

45
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,250
I'm talking about the gun.

46
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,541
Here. Oil it.

47
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:31,541
For now, go see if the fencing is intact!

48
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,166
Hey!

49
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:41,625
Who's that?

50
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,208
May I help you sir?

51
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:45,708
Welcome!

52
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:47,541
Looking for a homestay?

53
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,916
No..I've come from Bangalore..

54
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:54,125
..Actually my coffee store..

55
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:55,916
..who-who is your trader?

56
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:59,625
No one. We are awaiting our first bloom.

57
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:02,250
I am looking to start my own
chain of coffee stores.

58
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,083
Haven't thought about
selling it to retailers.

59
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:06,666
Since when are you in retailing?

60
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,083
By the way, what are current market prices?

61
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:13,333
You know, we don't have any
money left for irrigating.

62
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:17,500
We've spent everything
on processing machinery.

63
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,750
Processing machinery! Yeah!

64
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,208
Hey tell me this.

65
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:30,250
Instant coffee. Has it
affected your business?

66
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,083
S-sir..uh..I-I'll see you later.

67
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,041
We could discuss business.

68
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:35,875
Later sir.

69
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:37,791
OK.

70
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:39,875
Your name?

71
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:42,500
Dev.

72
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,500
Anand? (LIKE THE FILM STAR?)

73
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:19,125
Dev!

74
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:23,125
Its-it's really you!

75
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,500
What are you doing here?

76
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,625
Uh..i-it's a fam-family matter.

77
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:33,708
You live around here?

78
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:40,416
No no..uh..I've come from Bangalore-

79
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,875
I'm here to source coffee
from some of these estates.

80
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:45,583
Okay.

81
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,416
I'm in a bit of a hurry. See you.

82
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:48,666
Dev, wait.

83
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:52,458
Come to our estate and
have a cup of coffee.

84
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:55,416
You live-you live here?

85
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,791
I thought you were a tourist.

86
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:01,791
No no me and my husband..

87
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:07,500
My husband and I..we have an estate and..

88
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,416
We bought it 5 years ago.

89
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:13,375
Okay. Bye.

90
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:17,375
Sometime later.

91
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,750
Your fate hangs by a thread.

92
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:36,500
No one knows how it gets
tangled up with other threads.

93
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,958
This thread of yours is kicked around
in the field of space and time.

94
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:48,166
The great samsaric (WORLDLY LIFE)
disco is being played now..

95
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,333
.. now..

96
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:54,333
.. and now.

97
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:04,041
2 kilos coffee grind please.

98
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:18,458
Puja (PRAYER) without showering? Not good!

99
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,458
I'm clean on the inside. Unlike you.

100
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:28,791
You come from earth. You return to earth.

101
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:35,916
And in between, you are
just a speck of dust.

102
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:39,208
I'm running late. Have to get to work..

103
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:40,375
Why don't you?

104
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:48,625
Why does he hate? Caught between pairs
of opposites, desiring results-

105
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:49,416
How much?

106
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:53,416
2 kilos.

107
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:59,166
When you dwell upon objects
of fancy, attachment.

108
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:08,166
Did you book your ticket to Coorg?

109
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:12,166
No.

110
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm reading.

111
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,541
I got a notice from the bank.
We have defaulted twice.

112
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,458
- The store will be gone...
- Someday I will be gone too.

113
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,541
I run the store so that I
leave you with something.

114
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:25,791
Right?

115
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,833
This is why I sold our estate.

116
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:30,833
With the money we could pay bank
instalments, run the house.

117
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:34,000
But no. You don't want to touch that money.

118
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,541
The store, the estate. What
is to be gained by them?

119
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,250
Now you will say the estate
was our family heritage.

120
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:42,041
All our ancestors have their
ashes scattered over there.

121
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:46,041
For a Coorgi, land is God and I don't
care for that sentiment. Right?

122
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:59,416
You think you own something,
but it actually owns you.

123
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:02,166
I have this clarity. When will you get it?

124
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,208
You are right.

125
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:08,208
Your clarity has not left
any places for my ashes.

126
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:16,125
Because you are unworthy
to even scatter my ashes!

127
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,125
Why didn't you show up
for dinner yesterday?

128
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:37,583
Everyone was there.

129
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,625
Would have been a nice change for you.

130
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:43,750
Who needs change?

131
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,750
I am going to Delhi in the evening.
To conduct interviews.

132
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,041
Do something man. Atleast manage the store.

133
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:53,083
Mom isn't well.

134
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:56,333
Anything else?

135
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:59,666
Yes. There's an opening in HR.

136
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,125
I can sneak you in.

137
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:05,125
Who needs a sneak in?

138
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:13,333
Thank you. Close the door on your way out.

139
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:22,375
Okay so go Coorg no?

140
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,208
Why you not go?

141
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:27,500
I know mom well. She just
wants to keep me busy.

142
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,500
Why will Poonacha uncle supply
to a small time retailer?

143
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,791
Nothing in it for him.

144
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,666
So you won't go?

145
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:38,666
Go for her sake.

146
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,833
Dhoni?

147
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:47,166
Yes! My Dhoni.

148
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:50,500
That businessman? His name
is Dhoni (CRICKET PLAYER)?

149
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,833
His name Rohit.

150
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:57,500
What am I? His keep.

151
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,916
So he is keeper. Dhoni.

152
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,583
Dark humor. Very good.

153
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:07,375
Meaning?

154
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,666
You are a nice girl.

155
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:13,625
How come you got into all this?

156
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:17,291
Why do you ask? You are save me?

157
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:20,291
You are save me?

158
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,166
You ought to ask me if-

159
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:25,166
Yeah tell me. How should I ask?

160
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:28,000
Get away.

161
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,416
God! Why do you come here?

162
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:36,791
You come, but you never
do me what Dhoni do.

163
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:38,000
I am a Sannyasi (RENUNCIATE).

164
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,125
It means I have nothing
to do with the world..

165
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:41,666
.. nor the world with me.

166
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:46,708
Oh? That explains why
you didn't get married.

167
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:51,958
Why you don't work but your mom does.

168
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:55,958
Why you sold your mom's
property without telling her.

169
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:00,166
I am gone.

170
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:01,833
Come on.

171
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:03,875
I don't dance your samsaric
(WORLDLY) disco, okay?

172
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:08,583
Disco dude, Sannyasi never get angry.

173
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:12,583
Oh, come on.

174
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:38,416
Is there ever a valid reason to grieve?

175
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:41,500
If there indeed is, then
there is no way out.

176
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
And if there isn't a valid reason to
grieve, then why do we grieve at all?

177
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,833
You grieve for that which
isn't worth grieving over.

178
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,208
Mom?

179
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:53,916
Death?

180
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:57,083
Is death not worth the trouble?

181
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,541
No. Not even death.

182
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:02,166
Like everything in this world,

183
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:06,166
death is not real.

184
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,000
Where are you going to do the rites?

185
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:31,500
In Coorg.

186
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,500
Amma had asked me to meet Poonacha uncle.

187
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,583
I brushed her off.

188
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:44,583
Fought with her.

189
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,666
Hello Ganesh, do you remember
Siddanagar, Biddanda estate?

190
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:17,833
I was the one who sold it..

191
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:23,041
..No, not Singh..Dev Anand Cariappa..

192
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:27,041
..no just like that..

193
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:31,916
Okay.

194
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:35,916
Thank you.

195
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:44,416
They sold it to some Singh
who sold it to someone else.

196
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:57,375
After I finish her rites, I will
source coffee for the store

197
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:02,083
from Biddanda,

198
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:06,083
which was our estate.

199
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:23,458
Here.

200
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:35,083
I miss my mother.

201
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,208
My mom..

202
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:45,208
..she just passed away.

203
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:55,541
I had nothing to do with the world.

204
00:17:56,041 --> 00:18:01,041
It is doing me now.

205
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:04,416
I can't do the worldly dance.

206
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:08,083
I just can't.

207
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:13,958
So? You want to become a
Sannyasi (RENUNCIATE)?

208
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:15,958
Why not?

209
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,458
A girl dumped you?

210
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:22,458
Or is it something else?

211
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:28,291
You said your mother passed away.

212
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:37,041
Do what she would have liked you to.

213
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:41,041
Renunciation can wait.

214
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:50,166
Believe me

215
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:54,416
even I have had a lot of
piercings when I was young.

216
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:58,958
I mean injections. No pain, no gain.

217
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,333
Papa knows best.

218
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:05,333
Trust me, kid.

219
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:15,083
That's it. All done.

220
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:17,500
Did it pain? No Right?

221
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,375
My sweet baby.

222
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:23,958
They'll turn out rotten if
you pamper them this much.

223
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:27,958
Dev Anand Cariappa!

224
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:35,208
Anika did mention you.

225
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:38,333
You two were friends in college, right?

226
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:40,500
Hi again.

227
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,291
Srinivas Panicker.

228
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:49,791
Oh. I thought you were Coorgi,
when I saw you with the gun.

229
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:53,875
Everyone thinks so. But you
aren't totally off the mark.

230
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:57,875
Mother Coorgi, father Mallu, grew
up in Dubai, worked in Australia.

231
00:20:58,375 --> 00:20:59,291
I am from nowhere.

232
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:03,750
But yes, being half Coorgi..

233
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:09,166
.. I am allowed to carry
a gun, without license.

234
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:12,375
So Anika tells me you are a coffee expert?

235
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:21,000
You know all about soil, seed,
weather, water, cultivation etc etc.

236
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,541
I do. But-

237
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:25,750
Why don't you inspect my plantation then?

238
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,958
Give me some tips, Mr. expert!

239
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:31,791
Well..I-

240
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,916
Hey come on.

241
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:36,000
Let me be upfront.

242
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,791
My love, you want to source
coffee at a cheaper rate and-

243
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:46,083
See how I just called you my love?

244
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:47,250
I hope you don't mind..

245
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:53,541
So I was saying, I will give
you free coffee for a year.

246
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:56,208
We will work out a
discounted rate after that.

247
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:59,125
But for now..

248
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:04,666
.. I will pay a month's salary,
that is, if you help me.

249
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:06,500
The work is simple..

250
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,875
..manage the plantation and
supervise the workers. Easy!

251
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:16,833
Okay, Mr Dev I think I'm intimidating you.

252
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:19,041
I am like this...

253
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:25,166
But you know what I say, the
coffee bloom is just a month away.

254
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:29,166
What rhyming!!

255
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:35,916
Mr Panicker there's no one to
manage the store back home-

256
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:40,625
Is that all? We'll work out
a better compensation!

257
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:42,500
Mr. Panicker, I don't know if I can-

258
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,750
Listen Dev..

259
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,583
We are on a coffee plantation.

260
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:48,083
We will have coffee.

261
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:52,083
Let's talk over coffee.

262
00:22:57,416 --> 00:23:01,208
Ok look, I'm requesting you.

263
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:04,875
You can have anybody take care
of your store for one month.

264
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:07,458
- Mr. Dev - It's not that easy sir-

265
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:12,333
I'll take care of your food and stay-

266
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:14,000
- I'll have to think about
it... You think too much.

267
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,041
Hi.

268
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:22,833
Ani sweetheart, you forgot to tell
me your friend is so stubborn.

269
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:26,958
Why don't you try and save me the trouble?

270
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:31,541
If you have to emotionally
blackmail him, don't hesitate.

271
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:36,916
Mr Dev, I'll be out and back in 30.
Please don't leave.

272
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,708
Ani don't let him leave.
At least not for a month!

273
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:42,000
See you.

274
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:47,166
Bye - Bye

275
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:51,166
I told him you wouldn't accept.

276
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:56,416
He knows?

277
00:23:56,916 --> 00:23:59,958
Just that we were friends in college.

278
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:03,958
Friends!

279
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:10,791
You can just say you won't do it.

280
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,791
Why me?

281
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:20,458
He was looking for a cultivation expert.

282
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:22,916
I knew you had a coffee plantation
and you had worked in it so-

283
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:26,916
Your husband is very irritating.

284
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:38,000
He is a bit enthusiastic but a good man.

285
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:43,125
It was his dream to own
a big coffee estate.

286
00:24:43,625 --> 00:24:47,958
We've attacked our last penny on this.

287
00:24:48,458 --> 00:24:49,625
Why?

288
00:24:50,125 --> 00:24:52,500
We were tired of the corporate
life and it was Vas' dream-

289
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,916
Oh! Vas' dream! Wow! Anika
I'm so thrilled for you.

290
00:24:57,416 --> 00:25:00,916
So in the end, everything worked
out just fine for you. Didn't it?

291
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:21,791
What do we do now?

292
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,000
What is this?

293
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,041
Poison.

294
00:25:27,541 --> 00:25:28,916
Wait.

295
00:25:29,416 --> 00:25:31,791
I go to America for a couple
of years and you take poison.

296
00:25:32,291 --> 00:25:33,041
We were going to go together, Weren't we?

297
00:25:33,541 --> 00:25:34,166
Little did I know dad would lose his job-

298
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:35,333
I can't live without you!

299
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:37,416
This long distance thing. It never works!

300
00:25:37,916 --> 00:25:38,541
Okay but-

301
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:43,750
- It just never works Dev!
- Okay! What do you suggest we do?

302
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,166
Let's get married!

303
00:25:45,666 --> 00:25:46,500
- What?
- Let's get married.

304
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,833
If they freak out, your dad
and mine, we'll drink poison!

305
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:50,208
- Please baby!
- We'll show it to them!

306
00:25:50,708 --> 00:25:51,625
- No no no listen to me.
- Let's get married!

307
00:25:52,125 --> 00:25:53,458
- Calm down baby!
- No let's get married.

308
00:25:53,958 --> 00:25:55,208
If not, let's drink poison!

309
00:25:55,708 --> 00:26:00,333
Baby no! No poison drinking!

310
00:26:00,833 --> 00:26:04,041
Baby no please, please!

311
00:26:04,541 --> 00:26:08,041
- Alright let's get married.
- Promise?

312
00:26:10,875 --> 00:26:11,083
Sure?

313
00:26:11,583 --> 00:26:15,083
Yes. Ok.

314
00:27:02,916 --> 00:27:03,500
Hello..

315
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,666
What's up? Deal fixed?

316
00:27:07,166 --> 00:27:09,041
Anika is here.

317
00:27:09,541 --> 00:27:10,125
What? Where?

318
00:27:10,625 --> 00:27:13,833
Here man! Where the deal is to be fixed.
Right here.

319
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:15,166
So what now?

320
00:27:15,666 --> 00:27:18,333
She and her husband..

321
00:27:18,833 --> 00:27:24,208
They want me to help them
with their coffee crop..

322
00:27:24,708 --> 00:27:28,333
Look man, I would have fixed it but..
Anika is right in my face dude-

323
00:27:28,833 --> 00:27:31,666
Listen Dev. If you try to
flee, I will beat you.

324
00:27:32,166 --> 00:27:33,125
One month right? Do it..

325
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:36,958
Focus on Amma. Behave with Anika.

326
00:27:37,458 --> 00:27:38,958
Till the time you are there..

327
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:42,458
Seal the deal, come back.
I'll buy you a drink.

328
00:27:42,958 --> 00:27:43,333
Bye.

329
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:47,333
Listen-

330
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,750
Look, I should have
behaved better with you.

331
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:15,750
It's okay.

332
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,250
I'll take up the offer.

333
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,875
Dev!

334
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:28,041
You're still here!

335
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:31,041
Looks like you couldn't
escape Anika's charm.

336
00:28:31,541 --> 00:28:33,541
So, what's your decision?

337
00:28:34,041 --> 00:28:34,750
I'll do it, sir.

338
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,833
That's fantastic! Thank you so so much.

339
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:42,500
Ani, arrange for Dev's stay
in our guest room. We have a-

340
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,125
One second Mr. Panicker.

341
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:47,291
I want to live with the workers.

342
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:49,250
Why would you want that?

343
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:55,500
You are Ani's friend..Ani?

344
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,041
You sure?

345
00:28:57,541 --> 00:28:58,333
I'm very sure sir.

346
00:28:58,833 --> 00:29:02,500
There won't be a discussion on this.

347
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,500
Okay. Whatever turns you on mate.

348
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:14,625
Disco dude! Disappear?

349
00:29:15,125 --> 00:29:17,791
Still in Coorg?

350
00:29:18,291 --> 00:29:20,125
I need your help.

351
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:21,791
Tell me what I need to do.

352
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:23,750
I have to stay here a month.

353
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,375
Once the bloom happens,
the deal will be sealed.

354
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:29,541
Until then, will you
take care of the store?

355
00:29:30,041 --> 00:29:33,208
Please. For me?

356
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:34,833
Alright.

357
00:29:35,333 --> 00:29:38,333
Don't blame me if I mess up.

358
00:29:38,833 --> 00:29:39,500
Come back soon!

359
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,875
Thanks Shondha.

360
00:29:41,375 --> 00:29:45,333
Mention not.

361
00:29:45,833 --> 00:29:49,333
So this is your room. You
need anything, tell me.

362
00:30:07,291 --> 00:30:10,791
Reminds me of a similarly small room.

363
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:19,916
After ages, you and me..again, in a room.

364
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,500
Ashtray!

365
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,750
Posh workers huh?

366
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:28,208
It's for you.

367
00:30:28,708 --> 00:30:32,208
I'm tired. Want to rest.

368
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,208
Who's that?

369
00:30:54,708 --> 00:30:58,208
Go check.

370
00:31:02,791 --> 00:31:04,125
You didn't call your father!

371
00:31:04,625 --> 00:31:08,125
Shit! Shit!!

372
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:19,375
Anika.

373
00:31:19,875 --> 00:31:21,833
Anika it's alright.

374
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:24,833
What are you doing?!

375
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:26,541
Baby, just trust me.

376
00:31:27,041 --> 00:31:28,666
We have got each other and we can do it.

377
00:31:29,166 --> 00:31:30,666
Let's do it!

378
00:31:31,166 --> 00:31:31,541
Lets have it.

379
00:31:32,041 --> 00:31:32,541
No!

380
00:31:33,041 --> 00:31:34,041
- No!
- Let's do it!

381
00:31:34,541 --> 00:31:35,083
- No!
- Let's do it!

382
00:31:35,583 --> 00:31:39,375
You do it first. I'll follow you!

383
00:31:39,875 --> 00:31:43,291
Dev, you do it first. I'll follow you!

384
00:31:43,791 --> 00:31:46,083
Anika.

385
00:31:46,583 --> 00:31:47,375
Anika.

386
00:31:47,875 --> 00:31:50,416
Ani have it! Have it!!

387
00:31:50,916 --> 00:31:54,416
Anika come out.

388
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:09,625
Aha! Hot coffee!

389
00:32:10,125 --> 00:32:11,291
If the universe so wills..

390
00:32:11,791 --> 00:32:15,458
..we will have our own coffee in a month.

391
00:32:15,958 --> 00:32:19,916
Just the thought of it is so exciting.

392
00:32:20,416 --> 00:32:22,875
Dev, you have had a look now.

393
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:25,375
In your expert onion..

394
00:32:25,875 --> 00:32:29,250
..will we be waking up in a month's
time and smelling our own coffee?

395
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:33,500
Uh, Mr. Panicker, it is vital
for a good crop that..

396
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,250
..the bloom doesn't turn out to be pink.

397
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:39,125
It is too early to say anything but..

398
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:42,125
..I have made a note of the
areas that need attention.

399
00:32:42,625 --> 00:32:44,500
The plants that are north
and east of the well..

400
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,291
..haven't been bushed and pruned properly.

401
00:32:47,791 --> 00:32:50,166
The sunlight is too direct
and humidity very low.

402
00:32:50,666 --> 00:32:52,333
The soil-

403
00:32:52,833 --> 00:32:59,458
Dev, no offence but all this
is too technical too boring.

404
00:32:59,958 --> 00:33:01,833
I don't understand a damn thing.

405
00:33:02,333 --> 00:33:04,291
Just tell me what needs to be done..

406
00:33:04,791 --> 00:33:08,416
..and you do it!

407
00:33:08,916 --> 00:33:11,583
Just make the bloom happen.

408
00:33:12,083 --> 00:33:15,250
Show me some magic!

409
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:18,375
Mr. Panicker, I will
create best conditions.

410
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:20,583
I don't know about magic.
I don't look for it.

411
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:22,000
Then you won't find it.

412
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:26,083
I seek it and I believe
seekers are finders.

413
00:33:26,583 --> 00:33:28,958
Fortunately, these are my plants..

414
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:31,916
..so it is my belief that counts!

415
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,291
Mr. Panicker do you believe in the..

416
00:33:33,791 --> 00:33:35,250
..magic of the universe,
signs and all that?

417
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:39,875
Absolutely. Karma Dev, Karma.

418
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:43,916
The universe speaks to us all the time.

419
00:33:44,416 --> 00:33:46,666
Not everyone is equipped to listen.

420
00:33:47,166 --> 00:33:48,291
Not me. I'm different.

421
00:33:48,791 --> 00:33:50,791
When ill fated winds blow my way..

422
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:53,250
I smell them a mile away..

423
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:57,041
And run the other way!

424
00:33:57,541 --> 00:34:01,375
Baby, if my poetry stuff takes off,
I'm going to sell this plantation..

425
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:05,083
..and concentrate on that.

426
00:34:05,583 --> 00:34:09,083
Coffee..

427
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,375
What are you doing?

428
00:34:19,875 --> 00:34:20,583
What?

429
00:34:21,083 --> 00:34:24,916
What are you doing?

430
00:34:25,416 --> 00:34:26,916
Pondering.

431
00:34:27,416 --> 00:34:28,916
About?

432
00:34:29,416 --> 00:34:32,916
Whether I should try jumping
into the well this time.

433
00:34:38,375 --> 00:34:42,875
Anyway, how did you find this estate?

434
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:44,416
Vaas is crazy about coffee.

435
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:45,958
He was on the look out for an
estate just like this one.

436
00:34:46,458 --> 00:34:48,458
I told you this was his dream.

437
00:34:48,958 --> 00:34:51,291
And you?

438
00:34:51,791 --> 00:34:54,500
This is his dream. Where are you in this?

439
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,041
Is this your dream too?

440
00:34:59,541 --> 00:35:03,333
Sorry. Continue.

441
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:06,125
Our agent showed it to us.

442
00:35:06,625 --> 00:35:08,416
Some..Singh guy, we bought it off him.

443
00:35:08,916 --> 00:35:09,916
Vaas took one look at this place.

444
00:35:10,416 --> 00:35:13,916
Didn't take him a second
to decide to buy it.

445
00:35:20,833 --> 00:35:24,333
It feels as if the artist has
morphed into an artisan.

446
00:35:29,958 --> 00:35:33,833
You were an artist Anika..and now?

447
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:36,625
Now just a woman filling water near a well.

448
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:43,125
Like one of your own paintings

449
00:35:43,625 --> 00:35:44,958
Dev, go.

450
00:35:45,458 --> 00:35:46,791
Why?

451
00:35:47,291 --> 00:35:48,625
Why?

452
00:35:49,125 --> 00:35:52,500
My being here is problematic to you?

453
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,333
That little episode, fading
away in your memory..

454
00:35:57,833 --> 00:36:00,000
..me being here has
refreshed it, hasn't it?

455
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,875
What the hell are you doing here?

456
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:06,125
A dutiful housewife, are you?

457
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:07,625
An extremely supportive wife, helping her..

458
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:09,875
..husband live his dream
while her own rots away?

459
00:36:10,375 --> 00:36:13,125
Sorry, sorry. Continue-

460
00:36:13,625 --> 00:36:17,125
Sorry go ahead fill that water.

461
00:36:24,541 --> 00:36:29,041
Clear it up quick.

462
00:36:29,541 --> 00:36:33,041
There..there.

463
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,041
So you are still an artist.

464
00:36:54,541 --> 00:36:59,458
Like I was.

465
00:36:59,958 --> 00:37:03,458
Still a crappy one?

466
00:37:10,458 --> 00:37:13,958
There's a cultural fest on.
Will you take me?

467
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Listen, I'm sorry about
what I said at the well.

468
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,250
I didn't personify maturity either.

469
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:11,583
Sorry back.

470
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:15,583
It'd been a week since I showered.
I didn't mind it.

471
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:26,500
Does this feel weird?

472
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,500
A bit, yes.

473
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,500
How did you meet Srinivas?

474
00:38:43,125 --> 00:38:46,041
I wasn't thinking about marriage.

475
00:38:46,541 --> 00:38:50,125
Vaas' family became
family friends in Dubai.

476
00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:54,416
My parents were after my
life..that I get married.

477
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:57,916
Vaas took a liking to me.

478
00:38:58,416 --> 00:39:03,250
There was Vaas and my parents.

479
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:06,125
There was a lot of pressure.

480
00:39:06,625 --> 00:39:08,208
So I figured..if I HAVE
to ruin someone's life..

481
00:39:08,708 --> 00:39:12,208
Why not this fellow's?

482
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:19,041
How about you? Any girlfriends?

483
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:23,041
Girlfriends? Me?

484
00:39:31,833 --> 00:39:35,375
When I woke up..

485
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:39,375
..at the hospital it was to a new reality.

486
00:39:42,625 --> 00:39:50,500
I was told that your
parents took you to Dubai.

487
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,375
Everything had changed.

488
00:39:54,875 --> 00:39:58,625
People were awkward around me..

489
00:39:59,125 --> 00:40:03,958
..friends, relatives..and parents.

490
00:40:04,458 --> 00:40:07,875
I would be stared at on the streets.

491
00:40:08,375 --> 00:40:12,041
Mom and Dad who were
always very cool with me..

492
00:40:12,541 --> 00:40:15,791
..started coming into my
room 5 times a night.

493
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:20,958
'Need anything? Are you feeling warm?
Should I turn on the fan?

494
00:40:21,458 --> 00:40:22,125
Do you need a bottle of water?'..

495
00:40:22,625 --> 00:40:26,125
..on some pretext or the other.

496
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:37,416
I knew they were coming in hoping
to find me alive each time.

497
00:40:37,916 --> 00:40:42,875
To cut a long story short,
I dropped out of college,

498
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:46,208
stopped meeting people,

499
00:40:46,708 --> 00:40:50,208
It's been 13 years.

500
00:40:54,833 --> 00:40:58,625
At least you've had a happy ending.

501
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:02,625
Oh. I've come to my end have I?

502
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:08,291
Don't happy endings depend
on where we stop the story?

503
00:41:08,791 --> 00:41:10,125
If we stop it right here, now..

504
00:41:10,625 --> 00:41:12,083
Is this a happy ending or a sad one?

505
00:41:12,583 --> 00:41:14,500
"Should I speak?"

506
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,541
"Or stay quiet."

507
00:41:18,041 --> 00:41:19,875
"The eyes..."

508
00:41:20,375 --> 00:41:22,875
"are doing the talking."

509
00:41:23,375 --> 00:41:28,166
"Should I speak or stay quiet."

510
00:41:28,666 --> 00:41:33,458
"The eyes are doing the talking"
- Should we go?

511
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:39,166
"The one that smiles and deserts you."

512
00:41:39,666 --> 00:41:43,166
"What should I call this now?"

513
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:11,833
"Life is simple."

514
00:42:12,333 --> 00:42:17,208
"But emotions are complicated."

515
00:42:17,708 --> 00:42:22,541
"The silence reveals everything."

516
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:27,458
"Is it what I think it is."

517
00:42:27,958 --> 00:42:32,750
"The forgotten emotions.."

518
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:36,750
"What union is this."

519
00:42:52,916 --> 00:42:58,833
Vaas! What are you doing?

520
00:42:59,333 --> 00:43:01,791
Baby, the drinks are on me.

521
00:43:02,291 --> 00:43:04,541
You bet they are.

522
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:08,666
Oops.

523
00:43:09,166 --> 00:43:11,541
Baby.

524
00:43:12,041 --> 00:43:15,833
Why don't you drink a proper drink?

525
00:43:16,333 --> 00:43:21,375
Dev, kindly make a drinkable drink
for our malkeen (OWNER) here.

526
00:43:21,875 --> 00:43:25,875
Vaas, stop with the malkeen business.

527
00:43:26,375 --> 00:43:29,375
Hang on. Let's get to the bottom of this.

528
00:43:29,875 --> 00:43:32,458
What is the name of this house?

529
00:43:32,958 --> 00:43:35,916
The name man?

530
00:43:36,416 --> 00:43:39,583
Thaa Mane.

531
00:43:40,083 --> 00:43:41,166
Correct.

532
00:43:41,666 --> 00:43:43,708
Why did we retain the
name when we bought it?

533
00:43:44,208 --> 00:43:45,458
Because-

534
00:43:45,958 --> 00:43:51,125
I'll say it. Because..

535
00:43:51,625 --> 00:43:56,458
My darling wife Mrs. Anika Panicker..

536
00:43:56,958 --> 00:44:00,291
..finds the name enchanting.

537
00:44:00,791 --> 00:44:07,625
Though she has no bloody
clue what it means.

538
00:44:08,125 --> 00:44:13,208
By the way, what does Thaa Mane mean?

539
00:44:13,708 --> 00:44:17,208
Mom's home.

540
00:44:19,541 --> 00:44:22,250
Really?

541
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:24,875
Who's mom's home?

542
00:44:25,375 --> 00:44:27,208
Never mind.

543
00:44:27,708 --> 00:44:32,291
Point is, this house is in her name.

544
00:44:32,791 --> 00:44:35,375
Know why?

545
00:44:35,875 --> 00:44:37,875
Number one.

546
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:43,916
She is my goddess of wealth.

547
00:44:44,416 --> 00:44:48,875
Hello Wealth Goddess.

548
00:44:49,375 --> 00:44:52,875
Number two.

549
00:44:54,875 --> 00:44:57,958
Like number two, anything
I buy in my name..

550
00:44:58,458 --> 00:45:00,583
..is separated from me.

551
00:45:01,083 --> 00:45:04,416
Crap. Sheer bad luck.

552
00:45:04,916 --> 00:45:07,583
Karma, Dev.

553
00:45:08,083 --> 00:45:15,375
Mr. Dev, please excuse me, I have to pee.

554
00:45:15,875 --> 00:45:17,250
Babe.

555
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:18,958
Baby.

556
00:45:19,458 --> 00:45:19,958
Go

557
00:45:20,458 --> 00:45:21,916
I'm high.

558
00:45:22,416 --> 00:45:25,333
Go.

559
00:45:25,833 --> 00:45:27,041
Can I do it in the bushes?

560
00:45:27,541 --> 00:45:30,916
Go home.

561
00:45:31,416 --> 00:45:34,916
It's my plantation man!

562
00:45:40,458 --> 00:45:42,750
You own all this?

563
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:48,250
You know Vaas, he believes
in signs, omens and whatnot.

564
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:51,458
It is so stupid.

565
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:55,458
So yes, all of it is in my name.

566
00:45:59,041 --> 00:46:00,375
Hey, didn't your family
own property in Coorg?

567
00:46:00,875 --> 00:46:02,250
I remember you telling me.

568
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:06,000
Is it still there?

569
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:10,000
Had to sell it.

570
00:46:31,625 --> 00:46:32,208
Hi.

571
00:46:32,708 --> 00:46:34,500
Hi.

572
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:35,666
Can I have some cold water?

573
00:46:36,166 --> 00:46:39,666
Sure. Come in.

574
00:46:46,083 --> 00:46:49,583
So? What do you think?

575
00:46:52,958 --> 00:46:55,291
Overdone. Too much decor.

576
00:46:55,791 --> 00:46:57,625
You cannot not find fault, no?

577
00:46:58,125 --> 00:46:59,291
You asked for my opinion. There it is.

578
00:46:59,791 --> 00:47:02,541
Yes, Why did I? My bad.

579
00:47:03,041 --> 00:47:06,541
Here.

580
00:47:08,541 --> 00:47:12,041
You don't drink coffee now.

581
00:47:14,166 --> 00:47:16,083
How is Amma?

582
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:20,083
And Prahlad? Rest of the gang?

583
00:47:23,833 --> 00:47:27,291
Prahlad is an IT Manager now..

584
00:47:27,791 --> 00:47:32,041
..rest of the gang are busy
leading their grown up lives..

585
00:47:32,541 --> 00:47:36,041
..Amma passed away.

586
00:47:43,083 --> 00:47:46,583
I'm so sorry Dev.

587
00:47:50,083 --> 00:47:53,583
What happened?

588
00:47:56,541 --> 00:47:59,750
She had her ailments and
her time was up I guess.

589
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:03,750
Just that..

590
00:48:08,791 --> 00:48:12,541
..there must have been a
better way for her to go.

591
00:48:13,041 --> 00:48:16,541
What do you mean, Dev?

592
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:23,708
It's nothing. Never mind..

593
00:48:24,208 --> 00:48:27,708
I miss her.

594
00:49:02,916 --> 00:49:04,458
I'm sorry.

595
00:49:04,958 --> 00:49:07,208
I'm sorry.

596
00:49:07,708 --> 00:49:10,916
I wasn't trying to take
advantage of your empathy.

597
00:49:11,416 --> 00:49:14,458
I know.

598
00:49:14,958 --> 00:49:18,458
No I'm sorry.

599
00:49:23,458 --> 00:49:26,958
Dev, it's okay. It was just a moment.

600
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,291
Now I remember why I fell for you.

601
00:49:47,791 --> 00:49:49,541
It's because I'm not a drama queen, right?

602
00:49:50,041 --> 00:49:53,250
No. It's the way you kiss.

603
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:54,250
Dev-

604
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:57,208
Listen Listen please..Just.

605
00:49:57,708 --> 00:49:58,708
No, don't say a thing.

606
00:49:59,208 --> 00:50:02,500
I'm happy..after eons! In fact..

607
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,500
..I should be going now.

608
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:05,291
Dev-

609
00:50:05,791 --> 00:50:09,291
No, don't say a word.

610
00:51:48,708 --> 00:51:52,208
You're regretting the kiss now.

611
00:51:57,666 --> 00:51:58,708
Yeah, you are.

612
00:51:59,208 --> 00:51:59,666
Look Dev-

613
00:52:00,166 --> 00:52:02,791
I know this isn't 1997.

614
00:52:03,291 --> 00:52:04,208
I know you're married.

615
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:05,750
I know you'll be feeling weird.

616
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:08,833
But every time you happen to
even accidentally look at me..

617
00:52:09,333 --> 00:52:11,125
..is a half-hearted, fake smile necessary?

618
00:52:11,625 --> 00:52:14,916
- It's nothing like that.
- How would I feel?

619
00:52:15,416 --> 00:52:17,208
What, you're thinking morals?

620
00:52:17,708 --> 00:52:20,083
15 years ago, only I was in your life.

621
00:52:20,583 --> 00:52:21,958
Now it is Srini, for the heck of it.

622
00:52:22,458 --> 00:52:25,791
It can be me again. Anika,
morals are flexible.

623
00:52:26,291 --> 00:52:27,083
Cannot happen.

624
00:52:27,583 --> 00:52:33,833
Why? Don't you feel anything for me?

625
00:52:34,333 --> 00:52:38,416
Anika, listen...

626
00:52:38,916 --> 00:52:41,833
I don't have an issue with Srini, but

627
00:52:42,333 --> 00:52:46,125
I like you and me better.

628
00:52:46,625 --> 00:52:50,125
Give us another chance-

629
00:52:52,083 --> 00:52:54,500
Anika, we have a history.

630
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,208
And I have a present. I love my husband.

631
00:52:57,708 --> 00:52:59,958
And not for the heck of it . It is real.

632
00:53:00,458 --> 00:53:03,958
And me?

633
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:09,041
I can't begin from the beginning, with you.

634
00:53:09,541 --> 00:53:12,791
It's exhausting.

635
00:53:13,291 --> 00:53:14,833
I care about you but..

636
00:53:15,333 --> 00:53:17,500
..you and me together, we are poison.

637
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,500
Literally.

638
00:53:23,458 --> 00:53:26,958
Did the kiss mean anything to you?

639
00:53:28,791 --> 00:53:32,375
A left over reaction. Of
a time that and whatnot.

640
00:53:32,875 --> 00:53:36,708
I'm sorry if you felt it was the
start of something, but it's not.

641
00:53:37,208 --> 00:53:39,291
It'll rain soon, the bloom
will happen and you will-

642
00:53:39,791 --> 00:53:42,416
Dev!

643
00:53:42,916 --> 00:53:45,083
Get out!

644
00:53:45,583 --> 00:53:49,083
Get out!

645
00:54:03,583 --> 00:54:04,916
Ani!!

646
00:54:05,416 --> 00:54:06,541
Ani.. Have it.

647
00:54:07,041 --> 00:54:09,375
Ani!!

648
00:54:09,875 --> 00:54:11,041
I can't do it!

649
00:54:11,541 --> 00:54:13,833
I can't do it! I can't!

650
00:54:14,333 --> 00:54:17,833
I can't do it!

651
00:54:40,916 --> 00:54:44,041
Clamoring for love from
others, you forget..

652
00:54:44,541 --> 00:54:49,791
..what your true purpose is.
To discover yourself.

653
00:54:50,291 --> 00:54:55,125
Everything dependent on others
is the cause for misery.

654
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:59,125
You take yourself for granted.

655
00:54:59,625 --> 00:55:03,541
The whole of existence hides inside you.

656
00:55:04,041 --> 00:55:07,708
You do not need approval from others.

657
00:55:08,208 --> 00:55:10,333
Own up to what is yours.

658
00:55:10,833 --> 00:55:14,333
Get up and fight!

659
00:55:22,416 --> 00:55:23,041
My dear!

660
00:55:23,541 --> 00:55:24,375
Shondha!

661
00:55:24,875 --> 00:55:27,041
Of course it's me Shondha. From Bangalore.

662
00:55:27,541 --> 00:55:32,125
But you-you should have called.

663
00:55:32,625 --> 00:55:33,625
Who's at the store?!

664
00:55:34,125 --> 00:55:36,208
The bank people come every day.

665
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:39,083
You don't take my calls.
And Dhoni's family..

666
00:55:39,583 --> 00:55:42,958
..moved to Canada. He threw me out.

667
00:55:43,458 --> 00:55:44,833
So you came here?

668
00:55:45,333 --> 00:55:48,833
So where should I go?

669
00:55:52,958 --> 00:55:56,458
Wait, wait.

670
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,291
You may stay here.

671
00:56:07,791 --> 00:56:10,166
Listen, if someone asks,
tell them you are..

672
00:56:10,666 --> 00:56:13,333
..my friend from Bangalore. Okay?

673
00:56:13,833 --> 00:56:17,333
Okay.

674
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:21,541
Really good you came.

675
00:56:22,041 --> 00:56:25,166
Very good.

676
00:56:25,666 --> 00:56:28,333
Still not worthy?

677
00:56:28,833 --> 00:56:30,916
How much longer?

678
00:56:31,416 --> 00:56:35,916
Let her go soon.

679
00:56:36,416 --> 00:56:39,708
How long are you going to stay here?

680
00:56:40,208 --> 00:56:44,791
The rains are arriving..

681
00:56:45,291 --> 00:56:48,791
In a week, the bloom is awaited.

682
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,458
. On the 8th day, I will become worthy.

683
00:56:55,958 --> 00:56:59,458
How?

684
00:57:32,333 --> 00:57:36,791
This is so sweet!

685
00:57:37,291 --> 00:57:40,250
Hey!

686
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:46,083
- What are you doing?
- Just a sec.

687
00:57:46,583 --> 00:57:49,125
Step aside, mama!

688
00:57:49,625 --> 00:57:50,500
Where are you off to?

689
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,416
To celebrate with Dev.

690
00:57:53,916 --> 00:57:55,750
Take an umbrella..Dry yourself.

691
00:57:56,250 --> 00:58:00,916
What the date today? 7th right.
On the 15th..

692
00:58:01,416 --> 00:58:03,208
..at a plantation that is ours..

693
00:58:03,708 --> 00:58:09,000
..there is going to be a coffee bloom!

694
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:11,583
What the hell are you up to Dev!

695
00:58:12,083 --> 00:58:14,375
Dev!

696
00:58:14,875 --> 00:58:17,791
Where are you Dev Anand? It's raining!

697
00:58:18,291 --> 00:58:21,000
Let's celebr-Oh!

698
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:24,708
You're already celebrating. Sorry,
I didn't know you weren't alone!

699
00:58:25,208 --> 00:58:28,083
It's fine Srini. This
is my friend Shondha..

700
00:58:28,583 --> 00:58:30,208
..from Bangalore..to see me.

701
00:58:30,708 --> 00:58:31,250
Oh.

702
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:33,208
I hope it's not a problem
if she stays a few days.

703
00:58:33,708 --> 00:58:35,041
What problem, Dev?

704
00:58:35,541 --> 00:58:37,708
Please sit Shondha.

705
00:58:38,208 --> 00:58:43,458
I'm Srinivas Panicker, the
owner of this plantation.

706
00:58:43,958 --> 00:58:47,541
Oh, hello.

707
00:58:48,041 --> 00:58:53,375
Dev, the universe has given me a big sign!

708
00:58:53,875 --> 00:58:55,041
Yeah. I saw the sign too.

709
00:58:55,541 --> 00:58:58,791
Now it's just a matter of time.

710
00:58:59,291 --> 00:59:06,375
Why don't you join us for tea..or coffee..

711
00:59:06,875 --> 00:59:11,750
..that won't be our own, yet!
You could meet Anika.

712
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:17,458
She's trying out a new recipe.

713
00:59:17,958 --> 00:59:24,416
If I'm going down I'm taking you two along!

714
00:59:24,916 --> 00:59:27,041
Dev..Please come for sure.

715
00:59:27,541 --> 00:59:30,041
Shondha see you later.

716
00:59:30,541 --> 00:59:32,291
Oh..Forgot the sweets.

717
00:59:32,791 --> 00:59:36,708
Meanwhile, carry on with
your 'celebration'.

718
00:59:37,208 --> 00:59:40,708
Good one Srini... Good one...

719
00:59:44,125 --> 00:59:47,625
Please have something.

720
00:59:53,708 --> 00:59:54,500
Very good madam.

721
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,500
Thank you.

722
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,125
How do you know Dev?

723
01:00:01,625 --> 01:00:04,250
I had been to this temple like thing..

724
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:07,500
..for a heart-breath discourse, right dear?

725
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,208
Art of breathing.

726
01:00:09,708 --> 01:00:13,375
Yeah. We became friends there.

727
01:00:13,875 --> 01:00:15,291
What do you do?

728
01:00:15,791 --> 01:00:17,208
I keep.

729
01:00:17,708 --> 01:00:19,333
What do you keep?

730
01:00:19,833 --> 01:00:23,875
I keep of Dhoni, meaning Rohit-

731
01:00:24,375 --> 01:00:27,791
Not now though. I'm looking for a job.

732
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:31,416
Dev is helping me with it.

733
01:00:31,916 --> 01:00:33,500
Let's just have some coffee.

734
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,625
I'll pour.

735
01:00:37,125 --> 01:00:40,125
Okay. So it's decided.

736
01:00:40,625 --> 01:00:45,250
Once the bloom happens, we'll have a feast.

737
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:49,083
Which is bad news for the pigs.

738
01:00:49,583 --> 01:00:51,166
Great idea. I'll just go to the kitchen.

739
01:00:51,666 --> 01:00:52,666
OK, baby.

740
01:00:53,166 --> 01:00:57,458
We'll all pig out.

741
01:00:57,958 --> 01:00:58,583
Sir!

742
01:00:59,083 --> 01:01:00,750
What's the matter Dasappa?

743
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:03,875
West side sir! Brown spotting on leaves!

744
01:01:04,375 --> 01:01:05,208
Looks like a disease.

745
01:01:05,708 --> 01:01:09,875
- Let's have a look.
- You wait in the room.

746
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:13,875
Right here, sir.

747
01:01:15,583 --> 01:01:19,708
Nothing to worry. Looks
like a minor infection.

748
01:01:20,208 --> 01:01:24,208
Quite common right after it has rained.
It's called Coffee rust.

749
01:01:24,708 --> 01:01:26,916
Nothing a little brushing
and pruning wont heal.

750
01:01:27,416 --> 01:01:28,333
Are you sure?

751
01:01:28,833 --> 01:01:30,708
100 percent sure?

752
01:01:31,208 --> 01:01:33,541
Of course. It's nothing.

753
01:01:34,041 --> 01:01:35,500
Will this affect other plants as well?

754
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,416
Will the bloom be affected?

755
01:01:37,916 --> 01:01:39,250
No, not at all.

756
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:45,000
Still, I'll make double-sure.
I'll look at it closely again.

757
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:49,083
Relax Srini, nothing to worry about.

758
01:01:49,583 --> 01:01:52,625
Dasappa, keep an eye out. Let me know..

759
01:01:53,125 --> 01:01:55,958
..or Dev, if you see more of this.

760
01:01:56,458 --> 01:01:59,958
Damn.

761
01:02:05,541 --> 01:02:09,041
Bloody Chinese shit!

762
01:02:11,208 --> 01:02:16,583
Don't worry. Everything'll be fine.

763
01:02:17,083 --> 01:02:18,333
Do I look worried to you?

764
01:02:18,833 --> 01:02:23,166
Yes.

765
01:02:23,666 --> 01:02:27,166
Yeah I'm worried.

766
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:32,750
Dev will manage everything, right?

767
01:02:46,750 --> 01:02:50,875
You never mentioned Shondha.

768
01:02:51,375 --> 01:02:55,458
Was I supposed to?

769
01:02:55,958 --> 01:02:57,625
You are sure right?

770
01:02:58,125 --> 01:02:59,541
Is there reason to worry?

771
01:03:00,041 --> 01:03:02,208
About the Bloom?

772
01:03:02,708 --> 01:03:03,708
No.

773
01:03:04,208 --> 01:03:07,708
Are you not sure or should I not worry?

774
01:03:10,541 --> 01:03:12,625
You don't know how much the
forthcoming bloom means to Vas.

775
01:03:13,125 --> 01:03:17,166
Believe me, I do.

776
01:03:17,666 --> 01:03:20,083
He has entered into equity partnerships.

777
01:03:20,583 --> 01:03:22,208
Ordered machinery from South America.

778
01:03:22,708 --> 01:03:24,250
In ten years, he wants to start
a chain of coffee stores.

779
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:26,583
Really?

780
01:03:27,083 --> 01:03:29,083
He knows neither the 'C'
of coffee, nor of Crop.

781
01:03:29,583 --> 01:03:33,458
But he has ordered machinery!

782
01:03:33,958 --> 01:03:36,208
This is sacred earth.

783
01:03:36,708 --> 01:03:39,625
It asks for service, care, worship.

784
01:03:40,125 --> 01:03:41,208
Only then does it yield.

785
01:03:41,708 --> 01:03:43,541
Not so easy...

786
01:03:44,041 --> 01:03:45,375
What?

787
01:03:45,875 --> 01:03:48,958
What would you do without me?

788
01:03:49,458 --> 01:03:50,250
You guys are the limit!

789
01:03:50,750 --> 01:03:52,291
No respect for the land.

790
01:03:52,791 --> 01:03:55,125
No respect? What are you talking about?

791
01:03:55,625 --> 01:03:58,500
I'm doing my job.

792
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,333
I came into this late, yet I am
working my ass off for you people.

793
01:04:01,833 --> 01:04:03,208
That too in my own-

794
01:04:03,708 --> 01:04:04,750
In your own what?

795
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:07,750
In my own area of expertise
you question me!

796
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:11,750
I know what I'm doing.

797
01:04:31,958 --> 01:04:35,208
Brown, brown, brown! This,
and this, and this!

798
01:04:35,708 --> 01:04:37,750
They're all dying!

799
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:41,458
What the hell is going on?

800
01:04:41,958 --> 01:04:44,791
Some of them don't react well
to the rains. It happens.

801
01:04:45,291 --> 01:04:48,125
Oh I need to move them indoors now?!

802
01:04:48,625 --> 01:04:51,166
Some don't hold up well.

803
01:04:51,666 --> 01:04:55,041
Due to the soiling, due to inadequate
moisture Could be anything.

804
01:04:55,541 --> 01:04:58,500
Don't confuse me with jargon Dev!

805
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
And what do you mean 'could be anything'?

806
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:02,958
What kind of an expert are you?

807
01:05:03,458 --> 01:05:05,375
Find out the damned problem and solve it.

808
01:05:05,875 --> 01:05:07,458
Srini, you are overreacting.

809
01:05:07,958 --> 01:05:09,166
You will lose 40% of the crop at most.

810
01:05:09,666 --> 01:05:10,375
The rest will survive.

811
01:05:10,875 --> 01:05:17,750
40%?! That's almost half of them gone, man!

812
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:21,333
I'll do something. Will try to
bring the loss down to 15-20%.

813
01:05:21,833 --> 01:05:24,791
That is if the universe helps me out.

814
01:05:25,291 --> 01:05:28,250
Will you? Will you show me some magic?

815
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:31,541
That's on the universe, no?

816
01:05:32,041 --> 01:05:35,708
I'll do what I can. We'll see.

817
01:05:36,208 --> 01:05:38,833
You..don't seem confident, Dev.

818
01:05:39,333 --> 01:05:40,791
Thats what is killing me.

819
01:05:41,291 --> 01:05:46,375
Baby, let's take a second opinion.

820
01:05:46,875 --> 01:05:48,125
Good idea.

821
01:05:48,625 --> 01:05:52,125
I'll talk to Shenoy. If he is
in town, he'll come inspect.

822
01:06:03,333 --> 01:06:04,833
I need your photo.

823
01:06:05,333 --> 01:06:08,833
Oh!

824
01:06:10,083 --> 01:06:10,708
Take it.

825
01:06:11,208 --> 01:06:13,708
Where's the camera?

826
01:06:14,208 --> 01:06:16,041
If anyone stays for more
than 3 days in a homestay..

827
01:06:16,541 --> 01:06:17,625
..we need their photo on record.

828
01:06:18,125 --> 01:06:20,083
For police verification.

829
01:06:20,583 --> 01:06:22,083
If not, they question us.

830
01:06:22,583 --> 01:06:23,750
Meaning?

831
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:27,791
Passport, voter's ID..anything?

832
01:06:28,291 --> 01:06:30,291
Will a ration card work?

833
01:06:30,791 --> 01:06:34,500
I'm asking for a photo ID.

834
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:40,250
- Why?
- Homestay rules.

835
01:06:40,750 --> 01:06:42,625
Did Dev give his?

836
01:06:43,125 --> 01:06:46,625
I know Dev very well.

837
01:06:47,125 --> 01:06:50,416
I too. Very well.

838
01:06:50,916 --> 01:06:52,208
If you don't have one, you can't stay.

839
01:06:52,708 --> 01:06:54,708
You have 2 hours to pack up and leave.

840
01:06:55,208 --> 01:06:58,166
I'll leave when Dev tells me to, not you!
This is not your property!

841
01:06:58,666 --> 01:07:00,166
- Oh? Is it yours then?
- It is Dev's.

842
01:07:00,666 --> 01:07:03,291
If I tell Dev he will throw you out
with your joker husband even..

843
01:07:03,791 --> 01:07:08,750
..if you show him your
entire photo album. Get it?

844
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:11,125
Who told you this is Dev's property?

845
01:07:11,625 --> 01:07:12,458
He only.

846
01:07:12,958 --> 01:07:14,791
This whole thing is his family's property.

847
01:07:15,291 --> 01:07:18,250
So YOU pack up. Alright?

848
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:22,250
Oversmart woman!

849
01:07:30,375 --> 01:07:33,541
What was your family matter again?

850
01:07:34,041 --> 01:07:35,375
As I have said, to source coffee.

851
01:07:35,875 --> 01:07:38,333
That is business, not family.
Why did you come here?

852
01:07:38,833 --> 01:07:40,000
Because your husband begged me to.

853
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:42,208
But why this particular plantation?

854
01:07:42,708 --> 01:07:44,125
B. Devanand.

855
01:07:44,625 --> 01:07:49,125
B stands for..Biddanda, right?

856
01:07:49,625 --> 01:07:54,250
Look at me when I'm talking to you!

857
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:58,250
So this was your family's property that
they had to sell. And you're here to-

858
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:02,250
I sold it. Without telling them!

859
01:08:06,708 --> 01:08:08,750
I'm sorry about that but this
is legally our property now.

860
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:11,416
This is not mere 'property'.

861
01:08:11,916 --> 01:08:14,458
Right where you are standing, is
where I learnt to ride a cycle.

862
01:08:14,958 --> 01:08:16,666
Thaa Mane.. which you don't
even know the meaning of..

863
01:08:17,166 --> 01:08:18,125
..is MY mom's home!

864
01:08:18,625 --> 01:08:22,125
It is my identity.

865
01:08:25,208 --> 01:08:30,166
I haven't been able to let mom go yet!

866
01:08:30,666 --> 01:08:33,166
She died heartbroken because of me.

867
01:08:33,666 --> 01:08:37,166
You know what she told me? That I'm
unworthy to even scatter her ashes!

868
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:50,125
What do you want?

869
01:08:50,625 --> 01:08:55,625
Talk to him. Sell it to me.
I want this land back.

870
01:08:56,125 --> 01:08:57,208
Sell it to you?

871
01:08:57,708 --> 01:09:01,625
What do you mean sell?
And pack up and leave?

872
01:09:02,125 --> 01:09:03,291
- Just like that?!
- Yes.

873
01:09:03,791 --> 01:09:04,500
Can't do that.

874
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,916
You know what this estate means to
Vaas and you know how much he loves-

875
01:09:07,416 --> 01:09:10,208
Loves coffee? He doesn't know a thing.

876
01:09:10,708 --> 01:09:13,833
He doesn't want to either.
All he wants is magic!

877
01:09:14,333 --> 01:09:17,583
And you? You're worse than him. You
think you're supporting his dream?

878
01:09:18,083 --> 01:09:20,708
This is not his dream.

879
01:09:21,208 --> 01:09:22,291
If this doesn't work, well,
there's always another..

880
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:27,166
..fancy idea, another crazy
adventure to sign up for. Right?!

881
01:09:27,666 --> 01:09:31,166
- Get out of here!
- And if I don't?

882
01:09:34,208 --> 01:09:35,458
I'll have to tell Vaas.

883
01:09:35,958 --> 01:09:39,375
Oh really?

884
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:40,500
So will I.

885
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,416
- What do you mean?
- About us.

886
01:09:44,916 --> 01:09:45,333
What?!

887
01:09:45,833 --> 01:09:48,708
'What?!' I'll have to tell
him about our romance..

888
01:09:49,208 --> 01:09:51,791
..about the hotel room, about the
rat poison, which was your idea.

889
01:09:52,291 --> 01:09:54,125
Except you fed me but
chickened out yourself.

890
01:09:54,625 --> 01:09:57,083
I have nothing left to lose!

891
01:09:57,583 --> 01:09:58,916
He won't believe you.

892
01:09:59,416 --> 01:10:01,875
He is mature enough to understand that
you and I, were done a long time ago.

893
01:10:02,375 --> 01:10:04,291
Oh yeah?! But the kiss..that was now..

894
01:10:04,791 --> 01:10:06,833
..atleast according to me.

895
01:10:07,333 --> 01:10:10,458
Let's find out Vas' opinion.

896
01:10:10,958 --> 01:10:13,791
He will forgive me.

897
01:10:14,291 --> 01:10:17,041
Possibly.

898
01:10:17,541 --> 01:10:19,166
But then again, the poor man has taken..

899
01:10:19,666 --> 01:10:23,833
..huge loans, invested a
lot, ordered machinery.

900
01:10:24,333 --> 01:10:27,208
The bloom could turn Pink.

901
01:10:27,708 --> 01:10:28,958
He's under a lot of stress.

902
01:10:29,458 --> 01:10:35,458
And to top it off, the kiss. So
it's possible he won't forgive you.

903
01:10:35,958 --> 01:10:39,083
Convince him to sell the land.

904
01:10:39,583 --> 01:10:40,583
It's up to you to decide
if you want to tell him..

905
01:10:41,083 --> 01:10:42,416
..it's me you are selling it to.

906
01:10:42,916 --> 01:10:46,416
Let's not let it get ugly.

907
01:11:02,333 --> 01:11:05,041
Baby

908
01:11:05,541 --> 01:11:10,333
I hope the bloom turns out well.

909
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:14,500
Really has to come.

910
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:22,125
If it doesn't, we'll have to
cancel all retail contracts,

911
01:11:22,625 --> 01:11:26,125
carry all machinery on our heads
and flee from the loan people.

912
01:11:46,625 --> 01:11:50,666
What happened to you?

913
01:11:51,166 --> 01:11:53,541
What do you mean?

914
01:11:54,041 --> 01:11:55,791
This is careless ambition.

915
01:11:56,291 --> 01:11:57,916
Whoa!

916
01:11:58,416 --> 01:12:00,208
I'll take that as a compliment.

917
01:12:00,708 --> 01:12:02,791
You thinking I've ambition..
Is good enough for me.

918
01:12:03,291 --> 01:12:04,708
Be it careless.

919
01:12:05,208 --> 01:12:06,791
You want to destroy my life?

920
01:12:07,291 --> 01:12:09,500
There is no destruction.

921
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,166
Just a change of hands.

922
01:12:11,666 --> 01:12:13,750
From one to another

923
01:12:14,250 --> 01:12:17,500
I'm just taking back
what's rightfully mine.

924
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:18,750
You're not the Dev I once knew.

925
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:23,500
You're the Anika I once knew?

926
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,458
They took me to the police station.

927
01:12:26,958 --> 01:12:31,041
Asked me if I was kidnapped.

928
01:12:31,541 --> 01:12:36,958
Dad, did not even speak to
me and sent me to Dubai.

929
01:12:37,458 --> 01:12:40,958
He was ashamed of me.

930
01:12:44,083 --> 01:12:46,333
You didn't even contact me even
to see if I'm alive or not-

931
01:12:46,833 --> 01:12:48,625
Prahlad..

932
01:12:49,125 --> 01:12:52,625
I contacted Prahlad.

933
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:04,041
It was not just you who's
reality had changed.

934
01:13:04,541 --> 01:13:08,833
You were passing out and I
did not know what to do.

935
01:13:09,333 --> 01:13:11,125
I was young and I was stupid.

936
01:13:11,625 --> 01:13:14,875
I get it. I got the poison,
you took it, I didn't.

937
01:13:15,375 --> 01:13:16,458
That explains all this, right?

938
01:13:16,958 --> 01:13:19,000
What rubbish!

939
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:22,041
Why do women mix issues?

940
01:13:22,541 --> 01:13:24,208
We were both equally stupid.

941
01:13:24,708 --> 01:13:26,458
This has no connect with that.

942
01:13:26,958 --> 01:13:28,333
You know I was hoping you'd say..

943
01:13:28,833 --> 01:13:31,791
..Anika the poison was your
idea, I took it you didn't.

944
01:13:32,291 --> 01:13:34,541
My life got ruined, so here is payback.

945
01:13:35,041 --> 01:13:38,541
What?

946
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:44,333
I understand revenge, but this is worse.

947
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:21,125
Elephant on the loose... Elephant.

948
01:14:21,625 --> 01:14:23,375
Hey, distract it there..

949
01:14:23,875 --> 01:14:25,500
Everybody, please do not panic!

950
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:31,750
Please go into the bushes and stay there!

951
01:14:32,250 --> 01:14:33,833
Dasappa, bring me my gun. Quick!

952
01:14:34,333 --> 01:14:36,291
Stay in there..

953
01:14:36,791 --> 01:14:41,541
Hey ..we are coming.

954
01:14:42,041 --> 01:14:45,541
Quick Dasappa!

955
01:14:48,666 --> 01:14:49,541
Vaas!

956
01:14:50,041 --> 01:14:50,958
Vaas!

957
01:14:51,458 --> 01:14:54,958
Vaas!

958
01:14:56,375 --> 01:14:57,541
Vaas!

959
01:14:58,041 --> 01:15:03,291
Vaas! What happened?!

960
01:15:03,791 --> 01:15:07,291
Vaas..

961
01:15:20,916 --> 01:15:25,416
Why are you here?

962
01:15:25,916 --> 01:15:29,416
I came to see madam.

963
01:15:33,833 --> 01:15:39,208
What are you doing, my dear?
I don't get it.

964
01:15:39,708 --> 01:15:42,916
You haven't scattered Amma's
ashes, you lied to them..

965
01:15:43,416 --> 01:15:48,791
..about the land, didn't tell
me the truth about Anika.

966
01:15:49,291 --> 01:15:51,000
Is this right?

967
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:52,708
No my dear, it isn't.

968
01:15:53,208 --> 01:15:57,708
You are lecturing me? You?

969
01:15:58,208 --> 01:16:00,500
I shouldn't?

970
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:04,875
Because I keep?

971
01:16:05,375 --> 01:16:08,791
I care you, my dear.

972
01:16:09,291 --> 01:16:11,541
I don't know what is right,

973
01:16:12,041 --> 01:16:15,541
but I know this is wrong.

974
01:16:17,541 --> 01:16:20,291
You are a lovely boy.

975
01:16:20,791 --> 01:16:26,125
You always respected me.

976
01:16:26,625 --> 01:16:30,125
Think about what you are doing.

977
01:16:33,125 --> 01:16:36,625
I have said too much.

978
01:16:43,083 --> 01:16:46,583
I'll go now.

979
01:16:56,541 --> 01:16:59,666
So you're the chief cultivator here.

980
01:17:00,166 --> 01:17:01,625
Sannyasi sir!

981
01:17:02,125 --> 01:17:05,625
I am speaking to you.

982
01:17:17,125 --> 01:17:22,958
We have talked but not
introduced ourselves.

983
01:17:23,458 --> 01:17:26,333
My name is Annappa, ASI,

984
01:17:26,833 --> 01:17:28,541
Siddanagar Police Station.

985
01:17:29,041 --> 01:17:29,583
B-but y-you-

986
01:17:30,083 --> 01:17:31,791
Yes yes.

987
01:17:32,291 --> 01:17:35,000
Vacation.

988
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:39,000
Vocation.

989
01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:49,041
But I don't get this.

990
01:17:49,541 --> 01:17:54,083
Mr. Panicker went into the
woods, gun in his hand.

991
01:17:54,583 --> 01:17:58,416
But after the shot was fired,
the gun was in your hands.

992
01:17:58,916 --> 01:18:01,166
Sir, how many times do I tell you?

993
01:18:01,666 --> 01:18:04,708
The lever was jammed, it
misfired and went off by itself.

994
01:18:05,208 --> 01:18:09,000
How did it come to be in your hands?!

995
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:12,333
Nobody saw the shot being fired.

996
01:18:12,833 --> 01:18:15,916
You were with him and the
gun was seen to be..

997
01:18:16,416 --> 01:18:17,333
..in your hands.

998
01:18:17,833 --> 01:18:20,083
Sir, please ask Mr. Panicker himself.

999
01:18:20,583 --> 01:18:21,875
He will tell you I'm telling you the truth.

1000
01:18:22,375 --> 01:18:26,916
Of course I will, when he comes to.

1001
01:18:27,416 --> 01:18:33,083
That is, IF he comes to.

1002
01:18:33,583 --> 01:18:35,875
You aren't getting it.

1003
01:18:36,375 --> 01:18:39,458
You are in trouble, my friend.

1004
01:18:39,958 --> 01:18:43,458
Until this clears up, you
will be in my custody.

1005
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:55,000
I'm-I'm going to jail?!

1006
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:56,916
Yes.

1007
01:18:57,416 --> 01:18:58,708
For now.

1008
01:18:59,208 --> 01:19:02,666
At least until the
investigation is complete.

1009
01:19:03,166 --> 01:19:06,416
If you're innocent, I'll
let you go of course.

1010
01:19:06,916 --> 01:19:09,958
We will then have a chat
at the temple where..

1011
01:19:10,458 --> 01:19:14,375
..you can ask me about Karma, destiny etc.

1012
01:19:14,875 --> 01:19:20,166
But if you've been up to some mischief..

1013
01:19:20,666 --> 01:19:22,083
..then you'll have ample time
to ponder over the truths..

1014
01:19:22,583 --> 01:19:26,083
..of life, and maybe even learn some of it.

1015
01:19:36,250 --> 01:19:39,750
Don't worry, everything will be alright.

1016
01:20:29,625 --> 01:20:33,125
Sign here.

1017
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:42,000
Thank you, sir.

1018
01:20:46,458 --> 01:20:48,208
Anika, wait!

1019
01:20:48,708 --> 01:20:52,208
Get in the car.

1020
01:21:23,416 --> 01:21:31,000
Thanks for getting me out of there.

1021
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:32,500
You didn't have to.

1022
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,625
I did.

1023
01:21:35,125 --> 01:21:36,833
Vaas gave a statement as soon
as he regained consciousness.

1024
01:21:37,333 --> 01:21:40,833
You didn't have anything to do with it.
The gun misfired.

1025
01:21:45,250 --> 01:21:48,750
We are leaving.

1026
01:21:53,333 --> 01:21:57,875
I convinced him, pointed out all
the signs and omens to him.

1027
01:21:58,375 --> 01:22:00,041
I used his weakness against him.

1028
01:22:00,541 --> 01:22:03,041
Also emotionally manipulated him.

1029
01:22:03,541 --> 01:22:06,791
Moreover, we don't know
the 'C' of Coffee, do we?

1030
01:22:07,291 --> 01:22:10,791
Let's see where his next
fancy idea is going lead us.

1031
01:22:21,875 --> 01:22:25,250
Here's your stamp of worthiness.

1032
01:22:25,750 --> 01:22:27,291
Proof that you have made it.

1033
01:22:27,791 --> 01:22:28,500
It's a MOU.

1034
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:34,166
We will complete all formalities
in a month and leave for Dubai.

1035
01:22:34,666 --> 01:22:38,166
Take it.

1036
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:41,375
Anika..

1037
01:22:41,875 --> 01:22:45,375
You sabotaged the bloom.

1038
01:22:47,666 --> 01:22:50,208
Shenoy told me..

1039
01:22:50,708 --> 01:22:55,291
..there was clinically administered
wheat rust everywhere.

1040
01:22:55,791 --> 01:23:01,083
Only an expert could pull that off.

1041
01:23:01,583 --> 01:23:05,791
Anika, I'm sorry.

1042
01:23:06,291 --> 01:23:12,541
I broke Amma's heart. Because of me she-

1043
01:23:13,041 --> 01:23:14,250
I couldn't even express to her that-

1044
01:23:14,750 --> 01:23:18,250
Amma would be happy now?

1045
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,500
This is not about Amma.

1046
01:23:27,083 --> 01:23:31,958
This is your need to get even with me.

1047
01:23:32,458 --> 01:23:35,208
You blame me for whatever
happened that night..

1048
01:23:35,708 --> 01:23:39,791
..and for your subsequent life.

1049
01:23:40,291 --> 01:23:46,041
You can't stand the fact that
I am happy with someone.

1050
01:23:46,541 --> 01:23:50,041
And you tell me that I mix issues?

1051
01:23:56,458 --> 01:24:02,333
Maybe Vaas doesn't know
a thing about coffee..

1052
01:24:02,833 --> 01:24:07,416
..but poisoning the trust of..

1053
01:24:07,916 --> 01:24:11,583
..that which depends
entirely on our kindness..

1054
01:24:12,083 --> 01:24:15,583
..only a true lover is capable of it.

1055
01:24:21,666 --> 01:24:25,166
We both have lived up to it.

1056
01:24:37,416 --> 01:24:40,916
And..

1057
01:24:42,166 --> 01:24:45,666
And I don't think we could
have done differently.

1058
01:26:22,125 --> 01:26:25,666
When you dwell upon objects of fancy,

1059
01:26:26,166 --> 01:26:28,875
attachment is born.

1060
01:26:29,375 --> 01:26:32,916
From attachment is born desire

1061
01:26:33,416 --> 01:26:36,708
and when that desire is thwarted, anger.

1062
01:26:37,208 --> 01:26:40,041
From anger comes delusion

1063
01:26:40,541 --> 01:26:48,458
and from delusion, the loss of
everything valuable you have learned.

1064
01:26:48,958 --> 01:26:53,541
From this loss of values, the
mind becomes incapacitated.

1065
01:26:54,041 --> 01:27:00,833
And when the mind is incapacitated,
the person is destroyed.

1066
01:27:01,333 --> 01:27:05,791
But the one whose mind is steady

1067
01:27:06,291 --> 01:27:10,166
he moves in the world of desirous objects

1068
01:27:10,666 --> 01:27:15,541
free from likes and dislikes

1069
01:27:16,041 --> 01:27:19,791
and attains the clarity of

1070
01:27:20,291 --> 01:27:24,666
what is right action, what is not.

1071
01:27:25,166 --> 01:27:31,458
There is nothing more
fascinating than clarity.

1072
01:27:31,958 --> 01:27:36,333
There is nothing more
fascinating than clarity.

1073
01:27:36,357 --> 01:27:52,357
<font color="#ffff80"><b>Hope it helped -> bozxphd</b></font>
