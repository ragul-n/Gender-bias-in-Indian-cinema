1
00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:06,123
Popatlal, never has a bus stopped
at our doorstep. Explain this huge car

2
00:03:06,337 --> 00:03:08,795
Must've come asking for address.
Let's clear the air

3
00:03:16,648 --> 00:03:19,606
ls he the writer we called up?
- In Mercedes?

4
00:03:23,154 --> 00:03:27,409
Sir, when I got your call,
I left my tea and came over

5
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:30,583
I'm a writer. What reminds you
of this worthless man?

6
00:03:30,895 --> 00:03:34,411
Worthless? You don't know your worth
You've written a great story

7
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:38,489
What have I written?
- You have no idea what you've written

8
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:42,428
Something extraordinary?
- Fantastic! Mind-blowing! Terrific

9
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,087
Of all the directors, only you
figured out my script, sir

10
00:03:46,444 --> 00:03:51,427
No one even acknowledged me.
- Asses all. What'd asses know?

11
00:03:51,816 --> 00:03:56,105
But now you've found
a real connoisseur

12
00:03:56,287 --> 00:04:00,110
I'll set them ablaze!
- The script and him? Clear the air

13
00:04:00,525 --> 00:04:02,482
Get inside!
- Tell me

14
00:04:02,694 --> 00:04:05,447
I took it out on him because of you.
- Explain it, please

15
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:07,449
He didn't explain the fire.
Isn't it wrong?

16
00:04:10,435 --> 00:04:14,121
Sir, all these movies?
- I've seen them ten times each

17
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:17,727
You can't become a director otherwise.
- You mean you're making a debut?

18
00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:21,067
First film, brand new, first venture.
- If it materialises

19
00:04:21,546 --> 00:04:26,404
Who will act in it?
- The actors well, yes

20
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:31,076
your story is so novel, old actors
won't fit the bill

21
00:04:31,255 --> 00:04:35,078
They won't give a damn.
- Hey! Well, listen. You and I

22
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:37,216
are debuting as writer and director
- And I, as heroine

23
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,416
What?

24
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,415
Everything about us is new.
- Even the public

25
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:47,088
What rot! Let some thing stay
the way it is

26
00:04:47,271 --> 00:04:51,094
What he means is if all are debuting,
no one will watch

27
00:04:51,376 --> 00:04:56,166
You are making a mistake. Every
famous director once made his debut

28
00:04:56,481 --> 00:05:00,429
A dynamic writer and a fantastic script
I'm going to ignite a fire

29
00:05:00,651 --> 00:05:03,109
Ignite what? The film?
The audience? The cinema hall?

30
00:05:03,321 --> 00:05:05,608
Stop interfering.
Am I not talking to him?

31
00:05:07,692 --> 00:05:09,649
Excuse me excuse me!

32
00:05:10,495 --> 00:05:15,114
Yes, my boy?
- What are you offering me?

33
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:20,055
A huge title in the credits.
What name would you prefer?

34
00:05:20,271 --> 00:05:24,060
Name is Sher Singh. But I've thought
of Shekhar for the screen

35
00:05:24,242 --> 00:05:28,395
That's nice.
- But I'm a bit cash-strapped right non

36
00:05:31,115 --> 00:05:35,473
He's kidding. He roams around in
a Mercedes and cribs about money

37
00:05:37,488 --> 00:05:42,415
You are mistaken. I had no money
for a cab, so I came in a Mercedes

38
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,083
Now it's clear.
- I'll make it more clear

39
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,749
I work in a car service center,
and this car belongs to my boss

40
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:52,421
I understand. Smart boy.
He works for a living

41
00:05:52,637 --> 00:05:55,595
What about our livelihood?
- Shut up! Tell me, Popat

42
00:05:55,873 --> 00:05:58,433
What does a writer earn per movie?
- Zilch

43
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:03,099
Something, for sure?
- Sure, I won't let you starve

44
00:06:03,414 --> 00:06:08,432
I got it now I'll leave.
I know your fake types

45
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,447
Listen, listen
you can't shatter my dreams like this

46
00:06:15,193 --> 00:06:19,551
I've got a great break. There's
happiness in this office after years

47
00:06:20,264 --> 00:06:25,384
It's a question of my career.
Please please

48
00:06:26,771 --> 00:06:30,389
Please!
- Look, I understand your grief

49
00:06:30,608 --> 00:06:34,556
But how can I give my script away?
- Like this. Kid, you are worked up

50
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:38,067
I was kidding. You don't know
Chelaramani. I have raised the money

51
00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:41,068
How much will you charge?
- At least

52
00:06:41,252 --> 00:06:43,072
50,000.
- Done

53
00:06:51,896 --> 00:06:53,079
Torture

54
00:06:53,297 --> 00:06:54,412
Shekhar?

55
00:06:57,802 --> 00:07:00,590
Yes?
- Why do you look scared?

56
00:07:00,805 --> 00:07:04,753
Not at all. Actually,
I'm expecting my girlfriend

57
00:07:06,143 --> 00:07:09,590
If she spots me with you
- You'll be in trouble?

58
00:07:09,814 --> 00:07:12,772
No, but it'll ruin my evening

59
00:07:13,451 --> 00:07:16,432
You could say that I'm the heroine
of your movie

60
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:20,373
I haven't told her yet that
I'm working in movies. Because

61
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:25,051
these days even big budget films flop.
And ours is a low budget one

62
00:07:25,563 --> 00:07:30,546
I have no idea whether it'll work.
- No Shekhar, don't say that

63
00:07:31,102 --> 00:07:35,551
Don't say that. Our film will be a hit.
In fact, it'll be a super hit

64
00:07:36,507 --> 00:07:41,399
If it's a hit, I'll tell her.
Can we meet later?

65
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,362
Why are you so scared
of your girlfriend?

66
00:07:44,549 --> 00:07:47,564
Actually, I don't want to lose her.
She's one in a million

67
00:07:48,452 --> 00:07:53,572
What do I say?
You are full of intoxication

68
00:07:54,425 --> 00:07:56,405
If my heart goes hysteric,
don't blame me

69
00:07:56,694 --> 00:07:59,584
How sweet!
- It's not just about romance

70
00:08:00,298 --> 00:08:03,086
I want to marry.
- Congratulations

71
00:08:03,401 --> 00:08:04,448
Thank you

72
00:08:05,803 --> 00:08:09,421
Nisha? I mean, I was talking
about marrying her

73
00:08:09,607 --> 00:08:12,429
I mean, marrying you,
not her

74
00:08:12,877 --> 00:08:15,437
Won't you introduce us?
- This is my friend

75
00:08:15,813 --> 00:08:19,033
What?
- I mean, she's my boss' client

76
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,038
She buys cars from him.
- Client? Then why are you jittery?

77
00:08:22,253 --> 00:08:25,041
Who is jittery? You are raving.
- Really? All right

78
00:08:27,592 --> 00:08:29,549
Here make her your sister

79
00:08:33,631 --> 00:08:35,315
Tie it to my wrist.
- You're kidding

80
00:08:35,499 --> 00:08:38,059
It's a very serious joke.
- What nonsense!

81
00:08:38,336 --> 00:08:40,384
I have made 40 sisters
You are 41st.

82
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:43,055
No way, Shekhar

83
00:08:43,574 --> 00:08:46,191
We are not having an affair

84
00:08:47,178 --> 00:08:51,069
But I never considered you my brother

85
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:54,069
A sacred thread?
No way, Shekhar

86
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:56,568
No way!
_  are you crying?

87
00:08:57,488 --> 00:09:00,071
What the hell was going on?
- I swear, nothing

88
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:03,576
Tell me the truth.
- I swear, Nisha

89
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:07,553
Nisha, please!
- I'll kill myself

90
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:23,028
Madam?
- Baldev, the silly: girl took poison

91
00:09:23,247 --> 00:09:26,035
Madan, foolishness is
another name for love

92
00:09:26,417 --> 00:09:30,035
Take it easy. Don't worry, everything
will be fine. How's she now?

93
00:09:30,454 --> 00:09:34,038
Mr Chopra, the effect of the poison
hasn't ceased. The treatment is on

94
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:40,044
I don't understand what spell that
beggar has cast on Nisha

95
00:09:40,631 --> 00:09:45,717
Doctor, how is she now?
- Not to worry. She is out of danger

96
00:09:46,437 --> 00:09:48,053
Thank God

97
00:09:48,372 --> 00:09:50,386
Thank you very much.
- It's okay

98
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:58,059
I'll fix that swine. I'm not
sparing him. I'll have him jailed

99
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,070
Papa, reason with him.
Anger will only make matters worse

100
00:10:04,288 --> 00:10:07,576
One mustn't fuel a fire.
Let it cool down

101
00:10:08,492 --> 00:10:12,417
Then we'll douse it with love.
- What do you mean?

102
00:10:12,797 --> 00:10:17,587
A few more tiffs like this, and Nisha
will begin to hate that pauper

103
00:10:17,835 --> 00:10:22,090
And that is when you find a suitor
and marry her off. Simple

104
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:26,587
If this is how she earns shame,
how will I find her a suitor?

105
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:31,602
When will your friend help?
His son Vicky will marry our Nisha

106
00:10:35,553 --> 00:10:36,600
What?

107
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:42,612
True, Madan. Vicky loves Nisha dearly.
That's why he's still a bachelor

108
00:10:43,294 --> 00:10:46,252
Else, he'd have married long ago and
I'd be playing with my grandchildren

109
00:10:47,698 --> 00:10:49,655
Excuse me, uncle can I meet Nisha?

110
00:10:49,834 --> 00:10:51,620
Of course

111
00:11:00,978 --> 00:11:05,131
If we can't be together, at least you
can give me a chance to die with you

112
00:11:05,683 --> 00:11:09,130
Vicky, you know well that
I love Shekhar

113
00:11:09,854 --> 00:11:13,142
But you can't stop me
from loving you, Nisha. Anyway

114
00:11:14,792 --> 00:11:16,749
why did you take poison?

115
00:11:17,661 --> 00:11:20,585
You wanted to die a cowards death, eh
- Who wanted to me'?

116
00:11:21,132 --> 00:11:25,751
I just wanted to scare Shekhar.
But by mistake I consumed a bit more

117
00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:40,106
Tie this on him

118
00:11:44,522 --> 00:11:46,104
Hang on

119
00:11:49,827 --> 00:11:52,580
Now!
- "Brother, honour this sacred bond"

120
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:57,119
"Brother, do not forget
your little sister"

121
00:12:02,173 --> 00:12:04,130
Enough? Happy?

122
00:12:04,508 --> 00:12:07,796
Nisha, do you think Shekhar
made me his sister out of fear?

123
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,468
Actually, Shekhar loves you dearly

124
00:12:13,617 --> 00:12:16,234
That's why he tries to give in
to your foolish whims and fancies

125
00:12:17,454 --> 00:12:21,072
I tell you, love is trust, faith

126
00:12:21,792 --> 00:12:23,749
Suspicion is harmful, Nisha

127
00:12:24,728 --> 00:12:28,744
'Shekhar really does something wrong
he will never tell you

128
00:12:29,133 --> 00:12:31,090
What?
- I will tell you

129
00:12:33,237 --> 00:12:35,092
I will tell you

130
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,427
With what right did she
give me a sermon?

131
00:12:39,143 --> 00:12:42,431
She exercised all her rights
as my sister number forty-one

132
00:12:43,814 --> 00:12:46,772
Mr Chelaramani, where are we?
- At Swami Trilokanand's ashram

133
00:12:47,151 --> 00:12:52,100
Know what? If he agrees to come
to our inaugural shot

134
00:12:52,323 --> 00:12:54,439
we'll get tremendous coverage

135
00:12:54,825 --> 00:12:58,113
And God says we are not different,
we are one

136
00:12:58,662 --> 00:13:01,120
Swamiji
- What are you doing?

137
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:04,453
Stand up let go of my feet.
- No, Sire

138
00:13:04,835 --> 00:13:07,452
I won't get up until you agree
to grace our inaugural shot

139
00:13:07,671 --> 00:13:11,790
Chelaramani, try to understand.
I don't go for such occasion

140
00:13:12,343 --> 00:13:17,065
My blessings are with you.
Take the offerings

141
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:30,074
Sire, this is my writer Shekhar.
He's got a great story

142
00:13:31,262 --> 00:13:34,550
God too has written an interesting
story for him

143
00:13:37,134 --> 00:13:40,092
Very soon he's going
to be married, twice

144
00:13:41,538 --> 00:13:43,495
Wow! Congratulations

145
00:13:43,707 --> 00:13:48,429
Congratulations, my foot!
Sire, the girl I love

146
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:52,104
doesn't even tolerate the shadow
of another girl touching me

147
00:13:52,349 --> 00:13:54,772
Besides, I can't think of
marrying someone else

148
00:13:55,319 --> 00:13:59,108
But this is God's plan.
And His will

149
00:13:59,657 --> 00:14:03,446
will certainly be done.
- No no

150
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,109
Have a sweet

151
00:14:08,499 --> 00:14:10,456
You'll have two wives

152
00:14:14,538 --> 00:14:16,427
Ramsingh, call Bittu.
- Yes, sir

153
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,063
Where have you been? Your mother
called from the village

154
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:21,563
What did she say?
- Said something about your sister

155
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:24,069
She also wants you there at once

156
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:28,066
You're strange. My mother called
and you didn't take the message

157
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:31,410
Next time, I'll screw you.
- Excuse me!

158
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:34,080
I'm your boss,
not a telephone operator

159
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:39,081
The line had disturbances and it got
disconnected. Why don't you call her?

160
00:14:39,663 --> 00:14:43,418
You're strange. We don't have a phone
nobody there has a phone

161
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:47,092
There's one in the council
that doesn't work for weeks

162
00:14:47,504 --> 00:14:49,757
I'd reach there
before I get the call through

163
00:15:04,822 --> 00:15:07,575
Brother! Look, Ma,
brother is here

164
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:10,112
What? Sheru, my son !

165
00:15:11,562 --> 00:15:14,122
On time, son.
Bless you

166
00:15:14,398 --> 00:15:17,720
Ma, what's going on?
- Chutki is getting engaged

167
00:15:18,802 --> 00:15:22,056
Our Chutki is getting married?
- God has answered our prayers

168
00:15:22,439 --> 00:15:24,726
Finally, happiness has come
looking for us

169
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:29,062
Chutki

170
00:15:30,247 --> 00:15:32,534
our little girl is
getting married, eh?

171
00:15:34,118 --> 00:15:36,576
I'm so happy.
Ma

172
00:15:38,655 --> 00:15:42,080
who is the bridegroom?
- You'll go mad on knowing it

173
00:15:42,493 --> 00:15:46,077
He's not an ordinary person,
he belongs to a rich family

174
00:15:46,397 --> 00:15:50,083
Who is he?
- The Collector's son Harpreet

175
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:54,083
Harpreet is marrying Chutki?
- For the sake of his sister Sweaty

176
00:15:55,172 --> 00:15:59,564
For the sake of Sweety?
- Yes. She loves you dearly

177
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:06,102
Loves me?
- Yes. The Collector came seeking

178
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:10,441
the alliance. That's when I got to know
that she's been in love since childhood

179
00:16:10,654 --> 00:16:16,548
She's crazy for you.
But I told him that I have a daughter

180
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,546
And my son won't even think
of marrying before her

181
00:16:20,764 --> 00:16:24,052
I also told him that getting Chutki
married was very difficult

182
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:30,059
That's when Harpreet said,
he'd marry Chutki

183
00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:34,062
I was stunned

184
00:16:35,446 --> 00:16:39,064
I realised that a brother
is someone who sacrifices

185
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:43,571
his own happiness
Take it easy, don't ruin the henna

186
00:16:49,726 --> 00:16:53,412
The henna will never fade, she is
marrying into the Collector's family

187
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:55,577
She's going to rule

188
00:16:56,567 --> 00:16:59,081
Son, you've fallen silent?

189
00:17:00,504 --> 00:17:05,089
Nothing, mother.
- I agreed without asking you, son

190
00:17:05,509 --> 00:17:09,093
I was worried if Chutki
would ever get married

191
00:17:10,147 --> 00:17:13,594
Well, it's good for you too.
Sweety is a nice girl

192
00:17:14,485 --> 00:17:19,036
hope you are happy with my decision'
- I'm happy, Ma

193
00:17:19,256 --> 00:17:23,204
His sister's wedding is just fixed
and he's in tears

194
00:17:24,428 --> 00:17:26,408
He loves his sister dearly

195
00:17:27,431 --> 00:17:28,717
Awesome

196
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:32,724
Don't think so much, Mr Thakral.
Make the move

197
00:17:34,104 --> 00:17:37,062
I'm still trying
to figure out your move

198
00:17:38,275 --> 00:17:43,065
The rook moves straight, young man.
How can you move it diagonally

199
00:17:43,447 --> 00:17:45,063
and threaten my king?

200
00:17:46,517 --> 00:17:49,475
Don't forget, Mr Thakral,
it's a game

201
00:17:50,454 --> 00:17:52,070
And in bad times

202
00:17:54,725 --> 00:17:56,545
even a rook could go wild

203
00:17:57,127 --> 00:17:59,084
Say it again

204
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:01,084
Awesome!

205
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,086
Sister

206
00:18:05,736 --> 00:18:10,424
One runs only twice in life. In a race,
or when he's trapped in a case

207
00:18:10,641 --> 00:18:16,535
Or if it's a wedding news.
- God! I'll drop dead if he agrees

208
00:18:17,614 --> 00:18:20,504
Sis, he agreed to the wedding.
- I'm dead!

209
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,415
Exchange the garlands

210
00:18:38,101 --> 00:18:40,058
Exchange the garlands

211
00:18:48,212 --> 00:18:51,068
Let the bridegroom put the garland
around the bride's neck

212
00:18:51,281 --> 00:18:53,067
The garland, Sheru

213
00:18:54,117 --> 00:18:55,573
Go on

214
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,747
What happened to him?

215
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,082
His head was reeling

216
00:19:12,202 --> 00:19:14,557
Where am I? Where am I?

217
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:20,032
I repeat. Where am I ?
- You are with me

218
00:19:20,877 --> 00:19:24,029
What happened to you?
- What shouldn't have happened

219
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:27,039
What shouldn't have happened?
- What has happened

220
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:31,532
What are you saying?
- What I shouldn't be saying

221
00:19:31,788 --> 00:19:34,541
God! Why are you doing this?
- I don't know why

222
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:36,374
Where to?

223
00:19:37,628 --> 00:19:40,711
I had such colourful dreams
for this night

224
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:45,554
But I see everything in black and
white tonight. Why: is my head reeling'.-?

225
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:48,393
Why the hell is my head reeling?

226
00:19:50,173 --> 00:19:52,062
Please lie down

227
00:19:55,512 --> 00:19:57,731
What are you doing?
- Serving you

228
00:19:58,115 --> 00:20:01,562
Don't serve me.
- We'll be together all life

229
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:04,736
I'm your wife. You can't stop me
from serving you

230
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:06,738
Don't serve me.
- Please lie down

231
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:10,082
Why is your head reeling?
- Don't serve me

232
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,410
I'm so very afraid.
- Me too

233
00:20:12,596 --> 00:20:14,553
Why are you covering your face?

234
00:20:40,157 --> 00:20:43,115
"O my beloved"

235
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:56,788
"Your love, my love"

236
00:20:57,174 --> 00:20:59,131
"0 my love"

237
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:13,634
"I've fallen in love!
Goodness, I'm in love"

238
00:21:18,395 --> 00:21:26,416
"I never knew when you stirred
my heart"

239
00:21:29,139 --> 00:21:33,087
"I've fallen in love!
Goodness, I'm in love"

240
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:37,099
"I've fallen in love!
Goodness, I'm in love"

241
00:21:41,818 --> 00:21:46,107
"I never knew when you stirred
my heart"

242
00:22:18,121 --> 00:22:22,069
"Crazy in love,
I've forgotten the world"

243
00:22:26,463 --> 00:22:30,582
"I've realised, and I admit
I've taken a risk"

244
00:22:33,136 --> 00:22:37,084
"I've fallen in love!
Goodness, I'm in love"

245
00:22:37,307 --> 00:22:41,426
"0 my love"

246
00:22:41,678 --> 00:22:45,103
"O my beloved"

247
00:23:02,933 --> 00:23:05,118
"Draw my silken tresses"

248
00:23:07,304 --> 00:23:09,284
"with your fingers"

249
00:23:11,374 --> 00:23:13,126
"Caress my cheeks"

250
00:23:15,745 --> 00:23:17,395
"seduce me"

251
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:28,136
"I don't know how the kohl in my eyes
spread all over me"

252
00:23:28,525 --> 00:23:32,575
"I never knew when you
stirred my heart"

253
00:23:33,129 --> 00:23:34,676
"I've fallen in love"

254
00:23:34,865 --> 00:23:36,754
"Sweetheart, I'm in love"

255
00:23:56,486 --> 00:24:00,104
"In ecstasy, I revel"

256
00:24:00,323 --> 00:24:05,113
"My life is now fixed
with yours"

257
00:24:07,497 --> 00:24:12,116
"in your love, sweetheart"

258
00:24:48,805 --> 00:24:51,092
God! What have I done?

259
00:24:55,812 --> 00:25:00,466
Unwanted nuisance.
Oh, what have I done?

260
00:25:02,485 --> 00:25:05,102
God! What have I done?

261
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,117
It's not even a week since
the wedding. What's the hurry?

262
00:25:12,529 --> 00:25:14,782
Brother, you could wait
for a few more days

263
00:25:15,165 --> 00:25:17,384
Chutki, it'd kick up a storm here.
- A storm?

264
00:25:17,567 --> 00:25:22,050
I mean, people over there will
kick up a fuss. I got jobs unfinished

265
00:25:22,472 --> 00:25:26,568
You can start some work here, son.
God has bestowed everything upon us

266
00:25:26,843 --> 00:25:29,562
What's there in the city anyway?
- You have no idea, aunt

267
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:33,067
It'd be better for all of us
if I stay in the city

268
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:38,067
I mean, I have dreams in the city.
I've embarked on a huge project

269
00:25:38,254 --> 00:25:41,576
I'm interested in writing.
I have to complete the project

270
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:46,080
If it's a huge project, why don't you
take Sweety and your mother along?

271
00:25:46,463 --> 00:25:49,421
It's not such a huge project
and it hasn't taken off yet

272
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:52,086
God knows when it'll take off.
- ls it Ma?

273
00:25:52,502 --> 00:25:56,427
Yes, it's me. When will it start?
I've been hearing that for 5 years now

274
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:01,095
Ma, you and your son are lucky that
it has taken only five years

275
00:26:01,544 --> 00:26:06,095
You have no idea, the
film industry run is a marathon

276
00:26:06,483 --> 00:26:08,099
I'll take your leave now

277
00:26:10,153 --> 00:26:12,110
Bye. Be in touch

278
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:15,112
Listen

279
00:26:17,627 --> 00:26:20,380
I said
- What?

280
00:26:22,098 --> 00:26:25,056
Will you be going for film shoots?
- Of course

281
00:26:26,836 --> 00:26:29,055
You'll explain scenes to heroines?

282
00:26:29,239 --> 00:26:32,061
Yes, the writer does it. In the film
industry no one else understands Hind

283
00:26:32,242 --> 00:26:36,065
When you go to explain scenes,
don't wear that clean-shaven look

284
00:26:36,579 --> 00:26:40,561
Wear a stubble,
keep your hair unkempt

285
00:26:41,117 --> 00:26:44,405
and wear unionized,
old fashioned clothes

286
00:26:45,221 --> 00:26:48,077
What for?
- I'll be ruined

287
00:26:48,291 --> 00:26:50,248
if some heroine falls for you

288
00:26:53,129 --> 00:26:55,086
Water?
- Shut up!

289
00:26:55,298 --> 00:26:58,416
Sorry, I hurt you.
- Never mind

290
00:26:59,302 --> 00:27:01,259
Please don't weep.
- You won't understand my feelings

291
00:27:02,505 --> 00:27:09,093
There's violence, drama, emotion
and sex in my heart

292
00:27:10,146 --> 00:27:14,094
You won't understand. Don't worry,
I'll be all right

293
00:27:14,484 --> 00:27:17,044
Don't weep.
- I won't. Move!

294
00:27:17,353 --> 00:27:19,367
Please don't weep.
- I won't

295
00:27:35,305 --> 00:27:39,060
Wow! Amazing. We took a great shot
of the entourage

296
00:27:39,442 --> 00:27:43,060
got a closeup of the ass on the horse
- Wonderful

297
00:27:43,613 --> 00:27:47,561
Baby, somehow get into the hall,
we'll also catch the marital vows

298
00:27:47,784 --> 00:27:53,416
Hang on. Sir, if they find out that
we are shooting their wedding

299
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:57,078
for our film, they will shoot us.
- For that ominous face

300
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:00,418
at least speak positive.
- You'll know when they slipper you

301
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,416
What?
- Nothing, go ahead

302
00:28:04,467 --> 00:28:08,085
Has Nisha's father rented out
his villa for the shoot?

303
00:28:08,304 --> 00:28:11,092
He'll hire a villa? Out of question.
- Shut up, will ya?

304
00:28:11,307 --> 00:28:13,594
What's going on?
- There's a wedding going on

305
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:15,426
Who's marrying?

306
00:28:17,547 --> 00:28:20,027
What are you doing, Nisha?
- Stop! Or I'll shoot

307
00:28:21,484 --> 00:28:25,034
Listen, dear
- Stop, Papa. Or, I'll shoot myself

308
00:28:25,388 --> 00:28:27,538
No, Nisha
- Enough of this emotional blackmail

309
00:28:28,424 --> 00:28:30,210
I won't marry Vicky

310
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:35,414
Listen to me. Vicky is a nice boy,
he loves you, he'll keep you happy

311
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:39,053
I don't want to be happy.
I will marry only Shekhar

312
00:28:39,602 --> 00:28:42,583
Shekhar is not to be found, Nisha.
He has betrayed you and vanished

313
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,396
Nisha

314
00:28:49,112 --> 00:28:52,559
What are you doing?
- Shekhar? You are back?

315
00:28:54,317 --> 00:28:56,399
Papa is forcing me to marry Vicky

316
00:28:59,322 --> 00:29:04,078
You always desired to marry me off
with great pomp and splendour, Papa

317
00:29:06,462 --> 00:29:10,410
Of course, I will marry but only
the one I like

318
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:15,286
Shekhar, we are marrying right now

319
00:29:15,805 --> 00:29:17,694
Right now? Listen to me

320
00:29:18,274 --> 00:29:20,026
I won't hear a thing

321
00:29:20,276 --> 00:29:22,529
Yes son, come and marry her

322
00:29:22,779 --> 00:29:27,535
What are you saying, Madan?
You yourself had fixed this marriage

323
00:29:28,251 --> 00:29:30,538
Yes, I did. And now I'm calling it off

324
00:29:31,087 --> 00:29:32,703
Please son, marry her now

325
00:29:33,089 --> 00:29:37,037
What nonsense, uncle! How is
that possible? I came to explain things

326
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:40,218
I want to say something.
- I don't want to hear a thing

327
00:29:40,763 --> 00:29:43,050
Nisha, your problem is
you never lent me a ear

328
00:29:43,433 --> 00:29:47,051
I'll count only till three.
- You are educated

329
00:29:47,437 --> 00:29:49,724
At least count till hundred.
- One!

330
00:29:50,306 --> 00:29:54,061
Now how do I explain?
Come over here, we need to talk

331
00:29:54,611 --> 00:29:56,568
Two!
- Damn

332
00:29:57,113 --> 00:30:00,071
Mr Chelaramani, reason with her!
- I can't. Why don't you give in?

333
00:30:00,316 --> 00:30:05,072
Son, you know how stubborn she is.
She'll shoot herself. Please agree

334
00:30:05,288 --> 00:30:09,077
How can she shoot herself?
Listen to what I have to say

335
00:30:09,459 --> 00:30:13,077
I can't marry you.
- What? Why not?

336
00:30:13,463 --> 00:30:17,479
You love me, don't you?
- I do, but I must talk to you

337
00:30:22,472 --> 00:30:25,089
She's going to shoot herself.
- Nisha, don't do it, I say

338
00:30:25,341 --> 00:30:27,298
Three!
- No!

339
00:30:28,645 --> 00:30:30,101
Yes!
- Yes

340
00:30:30,246 --> 00:30:33,102
Yes?
- No! No, please

341
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:35,106
No?

342
00:30:35,485 --> 00:30:36,441
Yes, yes

343
00:30:56,172 --> 00:30:58,129
The garland, son

344
00:30:59,509 --> 00:31:01,125
The garland

345
00:31:10,687 --> 00:31:12,644
Come to your senses, Shekhar

346
00:31:13,189 --> 00:31:15,146
He's reeling.
- Get onions

347
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:24,418
What are you saying? Why didn't you
tell us before the wedding?

348
00:31:25,134 --> 00:31:30,083
What do you mean? Wasn't I trying
to say something then?

349
00:31:31,507 --> 00:31:36,593
She held a gun at her temple
and you forced me to marry her

350
00:31:36,813 --> 00:31:38,770
I was stunned

351
00:31:39,682 --> 00:31:42,105
Uncle, what's going to
happen of me now?

352
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:47,108
I'll take care of everything, son.
But don't tell Nisha anything now

353
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:51,614
I never wish to tell her. But if things
are cleared on the nuptial night

354
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:55,119
all the other nights go smooth.
- No, no

355
00:31:55,331 --> 00:31:58,778
Uncle, please tell her everything.
- No, son

356
00:31:59,569 --> 00:32:04,120
Look son, Nisha never got love.
As a kid, she lost her mother

357
00:32:04,374 --> 00:32:07,457
ind I was always caught up in business
- I understand

358
00:32:07,844 --> 00:32:12,793
She only has your love.
;he can share everything but your love

359
00:32:13,182 --> 00:32:16,140
I know.
- Then why are you sitting here?

360
00:32:16,452 --> 00:32:21,071
Go she is waiting for you.
- Please take care of everything

361
00:32:21,257 --> 00:32:24,545
I will take care of everything
- Can't find conviction in you, Mr Ran

362
00:32:25,161 --> 00:32:27,414
What are you saying? Day or night,
I'll manage everything

363
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:32,420
I'll manage the days and nights, you
take care of the problem. Smart Alec

364
00:32:33,136 --> 00:32:35,093
What is he saying?
- I'll manage your days and nights

365
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:42,089
Rao, until I tell Nisha
this must remain between us

366
00:32:42,845 --> 00:32:45,098
Nobody will know, sir

367
00:32:49,685 --> 00:32:51,767
You have this strange habit of
maintaining a diary

368
00:32:52,555 --> 00:32:56,503
You just said nobody must find out,
and you are putting it on paper?

369
00:33:07,603 --> 00:33:08,627
Vicky?

370
00:33:09,705 --> 00:33:12,629
What are you doing here?
- This isn't right, Nisha

371
00:33:13,843 --> 00:33:17,393
I wanted to marry you
and take you away

372
00:33:18,481 --> 00:33:22,406
But you never mind,
it happens

373
00:33:23,453 --> 00:33:25,740
I went home empty handed

374
00:33:26,789 --> 00:33:30,407
But I shall have you, Nisha.
- Are you in your senses, Vicky?

375
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:34,415
Yes, I am in my senses!
- Stop it, Vicky

376
00:33:35,131 --> 00:33:38,089
Stop it!
- You belong to me. Only me

377
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:43,750
Nisha, you are mine, you can't belong
to anyone else

378
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:46,097
What are you doing?
- Shut up

379
00:33:48,744 --> 00:33:50,098
Where to?

380
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:54,102
Back off, or I'll shoot!
- Really? I'll bomb you

381
00:33:54,317 --> 00:33:56,103
if you touch my wife.
- I'll shoot you

382
00:34:02,158 --> 00:34:04,115
Uncle
- Papa!

383
00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:11,119
Stop, swine!
- Shekhar

384
00:34:11,701 --> 00:34:15,126
I need to tell you something

385
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,097
Stop! Don't step forward

386
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:04,100
Nobody comes here, officer!
Else, I'll blast the gas station

387
00:35:04,654 --> 00:35:06,110
I'll blast it!

388
00:35:08,891 --> 00:35:11,246
Don't step forward!
I'll shoot

389
00:35:16,265 --> 00:35:17,221
No!

390
00:35:18,467 --> 00:35:23,052
No Vicky, no! No

391
00:35:42,792 --> 00:35:47,878
Sweety, how long will you wait
for him here?

392
00:35:48,331 --> 00:35:50,288
When he returns, he'll come
straight home, won't he?

393
00:35:52,501 --> 00:35:57,428
He used to come once in a fortnight or
a month, but this time he's an ass

394
00:35:58,341 --> 00:36:03,768
He's a fool. One doesn't
forget his wife like this

395
00:36:04,146 --> 00:36:09,095
No mother, he won't forget me
I mean, he won't forget us

396
00:36:09,819 --> 00:36:14,438
I feel he's in trouble
that's why he's not coming

397
00:36:14,957 --> 00:36:17,176
You will manage daddy's business
from now on

398
00:36:18,494 --> 00:36:21,543
This seat belongs to you now.
- What's the need to do business?

399
00:36:21,764 --> 00:36:25,052
We have property that can feed
seven generations

400
00:36:25,434 --> 00:36:30,725
What about the labourers and their
families who depend on our business?

401
00:36:31,641 --> 00:36:35,066
We can't let them starve.
- You are right

402
00:36:35,578 --> 00:36:40,061
But what do I tell the one who
employed me in my bad times?

403
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:44,075
How can I desert him?
- He can employ someone else

404
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,402
You don't understand, Nisha.
He depends a lot on me

405
00:36:47,123 --> 00:36:51,071
If I quit, the showroom will shut down.
And there are other things too

406
00:36:51,394 --> 00:36:53,408
how do I explain?
- Not a word

407
00:36:54,297 --> 00:36:57,415
You are the Managing Director now.
Mr Rao, help him out

408
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:01,091
But Nisha, try
- Be seated please

409
00:37:04,473 --> 00:37:05,588
Look

410
00:37:08,477 --> 00:37:09,763
Show me

411
00:37:10,146 --> 00:37:12,763
What's your problem?
It's a business worth millions

412
00:37:13,149 --> 00:37:16,369
and you are worried about that job.
- Mr Rao, you don't understand

413
00:37:16,786 --> 00:37:20,370
I'm a writer. What about my ambition?
- Everything will be fine

414
00:37:20,589 --> 00:37:26,039
Use our files to write your
movie scripts, no one will find out

415
00:37:26,262 --> 00:37:29,050
What happens to our business then?
- I'm here. Don't worry, I'll manage

416
00:37:29,265 --> 00:37:33,054
You mean I won't have to work?
- No. At the end of the month

417
00:37:33,302 --> 00:37:36,055
you will check the accounts
and sign some cheques, that's it

418
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,398
Mr Rao, how do I repay your favour?

419
00:37:41,444 --> 00:37:43,060
Just sign my salary cheques

420
00:37:44,113 --> 00:37:46,070
You are very practical

421
00:37:49,318 --> 00:37:53,573
I've smiled after a long time.
Pray that

422
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:56,242
there's no fresh trouble

423
00:38:00,229 --> 00:38:01,845
Hold this

424
00:38:04,467 --> 00:38:07,585
What's the matter, Sweety?
Are you all right?

425
00:38:08,404 --> 00:38:10,418
I'm fine, mother.
- Then?

426
00:38:10,673 --> 00:38:12,630
Is it true, Sweety?

427
00:38:13,142 --> 00:38:15,429
Thanks a million, Lord.
MY; m?

428
00:38:15,811 --> 00:38:20,032
I'll write a letter saying
he's going to be a father soon

429
00:38:20,249 --> 00:38:23,037
Just watch. He's going to
come dancing here

430
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:29,046
"My land produces gold and pearls"

431
00:38:29,258 --> 00:38:32,046
Congratulations, Mr Shekhar.
You are going to become a father

432
00:38:32,261 --> 00:38:34,047
Thank you very much

433
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:38,052
Congratulations?
But how do you know?

434
00:38:38,834 --> 00:38:41,394
Strange. I just examined Misha

435
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:45,391
You mean Nisha too?

436
00:38:50,513 --> 00:38:53,733
Nisha too?
What does that mean?

437
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,077
Who else is pregnant?
- Bye. See you again

438
00:39:01,123 --> 00:39:02,739
Thank you for the news.
- Hello?

439
00:39:03,125 --> 00:39:05,082
You are raving.
Who else can be pregnant?

440
00:39:05,494 --> 00:39:09,078
Then why did you say "Nisha too"?
- No, I said "Nisha hee"

441
00:39:09,465 --> 00:39:15,097
What does "Nisha hee" mean?
- It means hee-hee-hee

442
00:39:17,306 --> 00:39:20,697
You cut short my laughter. Silly

443
00:39:21,577 --> 00:39:23,534
You are too much, Shekhar!
- Too?

444
00:39:24,613 --> 00:39:27,366
Me too? Or only me?
- Only you

445
00:39:30,085 --> 00:39:34,033
Honey, I'm very happy today.
But something worries me

446
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:38,048
Worry?
- Yes. You know

447
00:39:39,428 --> 00:39:42,853
destiny has once again heaped
dual responsibilities on me

448
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:48,389
What do you mean?
- I only worried about my wife and job

449
00:39:49,472 --> 00:39:51,554
But now I'm worried
about my wife as well as my baby

450
00:39:52,641 --> 00:39:57,568
And as you know, when responsibilities
increase, one has to work harder

451
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:02,069
run here and there

452
00:40:03,452 --> 00:40:05,068
Reform, swine!

453
00:40:05,521 --> 00:40:07,410
What did you say?
- I said

454
00:40:07,656 --> 00:40:10,216
sometimes here sometimes there

455
00:40:38,687 --> 00:40:44,114
"My Prince Charming is hopeless"

456
00:40:44,493 --> 00:40:47,451
"I'm his wife"

457
00:40:48,364 --> 00:40:51,117
"He uses excuses to stay away"

458
00:40:51,567 --> 00:40:53,353
"He is a liar"

459
00:41:12,521 --> 00:41:17,413
"My beloved is hopeless"

460
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:21,418
"He always has alibis up his sleeves"

461
00:41:22,464 --> 00:41:25,582
"He forgets his way home"

462
00:41:25,834 --> 00:41:27,416
"He's such a madcap"

463
00:42:04,607 --> 00:42:07,622
"Come home soon, my love,
I'm growing rather restless"

464
00:42:08,177 --> 00:42:10,794
"Else, this Punjabi girl will die"

465
00:42:15,451 --> 00:42:18,068
"Without 'you,
these nights seem longer"

466
00:42:18,587 --> 00:42:20,476
"When will they grow shorter?"

467
00:42:20,856 --> 00:42:26,408
"My Prince Charming is hopeless"

468
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:33,080
"My beloved is hopeless"

469
00:43:04,366 --> 00:43:07,119
"Where are you lost?
You have no idea what I'm worth"

470
00:43:07,836 --> 00:43:10,589
"If I am upset,
I hope you will pacify me?"

471
00:43:11,173 --> 00:43:13,130
"Madcap, madcap"

472
00:43:15,177 --> 00:43:20,069
"For not coming home,
he makes a thousand excuses"

473
00:43:20,449 --> 00:43:23,066
"My beloved"

474
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:26,076
"is hopeless"

475
00:43:28,123 --> 00:43:31,081
"I'm his wife"

476
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:35,080
"He uses excuses to stay away"

477
00:43:35,264 --> 00:43:37,084
"He is a liar"

478
00:43:37,566 --> 00:43:43,084
"Your daddy is hopeless"

479
00:43:44,473 --> 00:43:49,593
"Your papa is hopeless"

480
00:43:57,686 --> 00:44:02,613
I hope you will return soon?
- Oh yes I'm not going away

481
00:44:03,826 --> 00:44:08,115
All appointments cancelled today.
Just one show tonight

482
00:44:08,397 --> 00:44:11,287
I wanted you home soon because
tomorrow is Tuk-tuk's birthday

483
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:15,125
We got to buy him a gift.
- That reminds me

484
00:44:15,704 --> 00:44:18,719
If I have my way, I'll give Tuk-tuk
a new gift every year

485
00:44:19,241 --> 00:44:22,063
Sometimes a sister,
sometimes a brother

486
00:44:22,244 --> 00:44:25,396
Tuk-tuk might come in.
- He can do no harm to me

487
00:44:25,614 --> 00:44:26,570
Papa

488
00:44:27,683 --> 00:44:30,402
What happened, son?
- You got a phone-call, Papa

489
00:44:32,121 --> 00:44:36,069
This is what you call spoilsport.
- No papa, it's called bell-the-cat

490
00:44:36,658 --> 00:44:40,083
-low dare you talk back at your father?
- You are too much

491
00:44:40,262 --> 00:44:41,741
Clever rascal

492
00:44:42,197 --> 00:44:44,086
Hello? Who's speaking?

493
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,757
Get to Kamalistan Studio
at once

494
00:44:47,136 --> 00:44:53,087
Are you crazy? No power on earth
can tear me apart from my wife today

495
00:44:53,642 --> 00:44:56,100
I got three powers standing before me

496
00:44:56,478 --> 00:45:00,528
ls it? Who are they?
I'll destroy them

497
00:45:01,283 --> 00:45:02,603
Your mother

498
00:45:03,452 --> 00:45:05,102
Your son Toni

499
00:45:06,655 --> 00:45:08,771
Finally, your wife Sweety

500
00:45:10,492 --> 00:45:13,610
Shall I have them delivered to you?
- Are you crazy?

501
00:45:14,329 --> 00:45:17,219
Stop the three I mean,
stop the party

502
00:45:17,633 --> 00:45:21,115
I want to settle the deal at any cost.
Hold on, I'm coming

503
00:45:22,104 --> 00:45:24,562
Ma my respects

504
00:45:25,474 --> 00:45:28,057
Toni, my son. How are you?
- Papa

505
00:45:28,911 --> 00:45:31,061
How've you been, Sweety?
- Better, now

506
00:45:32,481 --> 00:45:34,438
No letter, no telegram
how did you get here?

507
00:45:34,716 --> 00:45:38,402
What are you raving?
We couldn't help coming here

508
00:45:38,654 --> 00:45:42,079
My poor daughter-in-law, she doesn't
tell me, but I know how she feels

509
00:45:42,291 --> 00:45:44,578
She's been waiting for you.
- Don't be so uneasy

510
00:45:44,927 --> 00:45:48,409
Shut up! We can stay away no longer,
we have come here for good

511
00:45:49,131 --> 00:45:53,580
la, I have no home, no accommodation
- I've been hearing for 7 years now

512
00:45:54,136 --> 00:45:59,085
that you are building a house.
What, are you building a Taj Mahal?

513
00:45:59,341 --> 00:46:01,298
Now that we are here, we're staying

514
00:46:01,643 --> 00:46:04,601
Wherever you live,
we'll live there, happily

515
00:46:04,813 --> 00:46:08,101
Really? Will you live happily
where I live?

516
00:46:08,584 --> 00:46:10,598
Mr Chelaramani, tell her that

517
00:46:10,819 --> 00:46:15,438
a sheath cannot hold two swords

518
00:46:15,824 --> 00:46:19,044
I can't. I can't pay
for your new house

519
00:46:19,561 --> 00:46:21,609
Sure, scrooge, you don't even buy tea
for your unit

520
00:46:21,830 --> 00:46:23,252
Coming, Ma

521
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:27,046
Mr Chelaramani, you've already
swallowed my script

522
00:46:27,269 --> 00:46:32,389
Filthy Mind, give me an idea at least.
- Really? Then listen, Shekhar

523
00:46:33,442 --> 00:46:37,060
My idea will set fire
- To your idea? Or your filthy mind?

524
00:46:37,279 --> 00:46:42,069
Shut up! There's a watchman of a villa
who is bitten by the acting bug

525
00:46:42,284 --> 00:46:46,403
His boss is always away. I'll give
the watchman a role in my film

526
00:46:46,788 --> 00:46:49,837
He will give your family a shelter.
- Where did you flick the idea from?

527
00:46:51,393 --> 00:46:54,408
Congratulations, lady. Everything
s fine. We've managed accommodation

528
00:46:54,796 --> 00:46:58,084
I told you ! Once we reach Bombay,
everything will fall in place

529
00:47:00,235 --> 00:47:02,749
Aren't you happy that we have
come to stay with you?

530
00:47:03,138 --> 00:47:06,096
What are you saying? I'm so happy.
- You aren't wearing a smile

531
00:47:06,308 --> 00:47:08,094
What are you saying?
I'm laughing

532
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:12,758
Laughing? Or are you crying?
- This is how I laugh these days, Ma

533
00:47:15,484 --> 00:47:17,373
And this is how I cry

534
00:47:20,088 --> 00:47:23,535
He is right.
Now stop laughing and come on

535
00:47:31,166 --> 00:47:33,055
How don't sit there! (I'm-an

536
00:47:34,603 --> 00:47:36,059
Stop, Stop

537
00:47:37,773 --> 00:47:39,389
Come, Toni

538
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:42,062
I want ice cream, Mama.
- No, dear

539
00:47:42,277 --> 00:47:45,065
After you come home from school,
I'll make carrot-halwa for you

540
00:47:45,414 --> 00:47:49,738
Ice cream gives you a sore throat.
- I'm not a singer. Buy me ice cream

541
00:47:50,118 --> 00:47:52,405
Shut up, devil. If you say that again,
don't call me mummy

542
00:47:52,621 --> 00:47:55,079
All right, I'll call you aunt.
- Shut up

543
00:47:55,490 --> 00:47:57,413
Stay here, I'll go
and meet the Principal

544
00:48:00,128 --> 00:48:04,076
Excuse me, Mrs Nisha. The Principal
wants to talk to you about Tuk-tuk

545
00:48:04,299 --> 00:48:06,085
Let's go. You wait here.
I'll be back

546
00:48:10,272 --> 00:48:11,250
Son?

547
00:48:17,746 --> 00:48:19,566
Come here.
- Who? Me?

548
00:48:19,715 --> 00:48:21,035
Yes. Come here

549
00:48:23,452 --> 00:48:27,036
I told you not to eat ice cream.
It gives you sore throat. Throw it away

550
00:48:27,622 --> 00:48:31,513
What are you doing, aunt?
- Will you call me aunt?

551
00:48:32,761 --> 00:48:34,718
Mummy!
Because I didn't buy you ice cream, eh

552
00:48:36,498 --> 00:48:38,717
Who are you calling mummy?
Your mother is right here

553
00:48:39,334 --> 00:48:41,052
What are you doing?

554
00:48:41,737 --> 00:48:46,061
If you have ice cream again
- How dare you touch my son?

555
00:48:46,441 --> 00:48:50,059
You bought him ice cream, it doesn't
mean you can lay claim to my son

556
00:48:50,445 --> 00:48:52,402
You are raving.
Are you mad?

557
00:48:52,914 --> 00:48:56,566
To hell with "mad"!
I'm not scared of your English

558
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:00,077
Shut up! What do you think
of yourself? He is my son

559
00:49:00,489 --> 00:49:04,073
How dare you say that? Thank God
I didn't bring my husband along

560
00:49:04,292 --> 00:49:06,249
Or, you'd have laid claim on him too.
- You are crossing your limits now

561
00:49:06,661 --> 00:49:10,586
I'll call the police. Ask anyone you
want, my son's been studying here

562
00:49:10,832 --> 00:49:13,756
for the last five years.
- Five years? We haven't been here

563
00:49:14,136 --> 00:49:18,027
for five days. It's his first day,
but no more. Come on, son

564
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,397
Mummy!
- Stop, or I'll call the police

565
00:49:20,609 --> 00:49:23,226
Oh, will you? Aren't you trying
to steal my son away?

566
00:49:23,412 --> 00:49:26,029
Bloody oaf! Help!
- Let my son go

567
00:49:26,748 --> 00:49:30,082
He is my son !
- He is my son !

568
00:49:30,085 --> 00:49:33,043
Let him go, will ya?
- He is my son

569
00:49:33,422 --> 00:49:35,379
Toni, stop kidding.
Tell her you are my son

570
00:49:35,757 --> 00:49:38,044
I'll buy the ice cream stall for you

571
00:49:39,428 --> 00:49:41,044
Really, mummy?

572
00:49:48,437 --> 00:49:50,053
Oh God

573
00:50:08,924 --> 00:50:11,575
Oh my God! He looks exactly
like my Tuk-tuk

574
00:50:12,127 --> 00:50:15,745
And he looks like Toni.
- Carbon copy!

575
00:50:16,131 --> 00:50:19,419
I can't believe my eyes!
It's a miracle

576
00:50:20,502 --> 00:50:24,427
Mysterious ways of the Lord.
Forgive me for brawling with you

577
00:50:24,906 --> 00:50:29,093
Oh no, it's all right. In your shoes,
I'd have reacted the same way

578
00:50:30,278 --> 00:50:33,100
You are very sweet.
- Not Sweet, my name is Sweety

579
00:50:33,882 --> 00:50:36,442
And I am Nisha. Nice to meet you

580
00:50:36,651 --> 00:50:41,100
Nice to meet you too.
- Come home sometimes

581
00:50:41,323 --> 00:50:47,114
fly husband will be stunned to see him
- My husband will collapse

582
00:50:47,295 --> 00:50:49,252
So, promise?
- Promise

583
00:50:51,166 --> 00:50:54,454
Hi Nisha.
Know what happened at school today

584
00:50:54,703 --> 00:50:59,129
What happened?
- I saw a kid who resembles Tuk-tuk

585
00:50:59,975 --> 00:51:02,125
Did she find only his school
for admission?

586
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:04,267
What did you say?
- I said

587
00:51:04,846 --> 00:51:08,464
how can he resemble Tuk-tuk?
They may have the same features

588
00:51:09,184 --> 00:51:11,141
but not the same looks

589
00:51:11,319 --> 00:51:14,744
Shekhar, I couldn't believe my eyes.
- I see

590
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:18,073
I felt as if I was watching Tuk-tuk
in the mirror

591
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:20,615
Really?
- The entire school was stunned

592
00:51:21,296 --> 00:51:25,085
Both the children are carbon copies!
- This is amazing

593
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:30,083
amazing. You mean, we have lookalike
in our son's school?

594
00:51:30,872 --> 00:51:35,093
You think it's a joke? All right,
me him for yourself when he comes our

595
00:51:36,578 --> 00:51:41,095
Why would he come here?
- He has become Tuk-tuk's best friend

596
00:51:41,483 --> 00:51:44,100
What are you saying?
How could this happen?

597
00:51:44,486 --> 00:51:46,443
Toni has become Tuk-tuk's friend?

598
00:51:46,821 --> 00:51:50,109
Toni? How do you know he is Toni?

599
00:51:50,492 --> 00:51:53,610
How do I know? You just said
Toni and Tuk-tuk are friends

600
00:51:53,895 --> 00:51:56,114
Did I say that?
- Did I hear it on air then?

601
00:51:57,866 --> 00:52:01,621
All right, I must have said so.
- You did say that, honey

602
00:52:01,836 --> 00:52:05,124
What this "must" ?

603
00:52:06,508 --> 00:52:11,127
And Tom's mother Sweaty
she is very sweet

604
00:52:12,847 --> 00:52:15,805
We too have become best friends

605
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:22,411
Did you go to the kid's school?
Or to a kitty party?

606
00:52:22,624 --> 00:52:26,413
How dare you make friends? You haven
been in the city for a day

607
00:52:26,661 --> 00:52:28,413
how dare you make friends?

608
00:52:28,597 --> 00:52:32,420
There's nothing in it to lose
your temper like actor Dharmendra

609
00:52:32,801 --> 00:52:37,090
As if Dharmendra is your brother

610
00:52:37,305 --> 00:52:41,094
He may not. But for me, every man
is my brother except you

611
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:44,096
That's very good. But remember

612
00:52:44,312 --> 00:52:48,499
if you talk to your friend again,
it'll be bad for you

613
00:52:49,351 --> 00:52:53,106
What's the harm in getting acquainted
and making friends?

614
00:52:53,622 --> 00:52:58,446
(you don't know, Ma. The Maharashtriar
woman she has befriended is very rich

615
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:03,587
Anyone can become a millionaire by
answering a few questions these days

616
00:53:04,165 --> 00:53:08,454
What else? Toni will grow up to be
an actor, and we'll strike gold

617
00:53:08,903 --> 00:53:12,453
Sweety, you are not getting my point.
- Then explain

618
00:53:12,674 --> 00:53:16,395
I don't want my wife and son to
get a complex by seeing

619
00:53:16,645 --> 00:53:19,728
a rich man's family.
- Complex?

620
00:53:20,115 --> 00:53:25,064
Right. When you see Nisha's clothes
and ornaments, you'll suck my blood

621
00:53:26,187 --> 00:53:29,578
Yes. And when Toni sees Tuk-tuk
getting off a Mercedes

622
00:53:30,125 --> 00:53:34,073
he'll hate his school bus.
- Nothing of the sort will happen, Papa

623
00:53:34,396 --> 00:53:39,687
Right. Tuk-tuk and Toni
will be best friends

624
00:53:39,934 --> 00:53:41,083
No!

625
00:53:44,339 --> 00:53:48,094
I don't want any social dramas in
my house. You folks don't understand

626
00:53:50,478 --> 00:53:52,094
Tuk-tuk, come here

627
00:53:54,149 --> 00:53:55,765
I mean, Toni, come here

628
00:53:56,885 --> 00:53:58,432
Come on, I say

629
00:54:00,822 --> 00:54:03,109
Sit on my lap
and swear by me

630
00:54:03,558 --> 00:54:06,448
Near that you won't meet Tuk-tuk aga

631
00:54:06,828 --> 00:54:09,286
I won't meet him.
- Bless you, son

632
00:54:11,866 --> 00:54:15,120
You are ruining the lines
on my palm, kid

633
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:17,720
Tuk-tuk!
- That sounds familiar

634
00:54:18,306 --> 00:54:19,387
Toni

635
00:54:20,475 --> 00:54:24,059
Stunned, aren't you? I told you,
he looks exactly like our Tuk-tuk

636
00:54:24,279 --> 00:54:26,395
Come Toni, sit

637
00:54:27,615 --> 00:54:28,571
Papa?

638
00:54:30,618 --> 00:54:31,574
Papa?

639
00:54:33,555 --> 00:54:37,571
Why did you call him papa, son?
- Of course I won't call my dad mummy

640
00:54:38,326 --> 00:54:40,283
Good Lord!
- Oh my God

641
00:54:41,129 --> 00:54:46,454
Good God! Nisha, it means
even the fathers look alike

642
00:54:47,535 --> 00:54:50,095
They don't look alike,
you are my father

643
00:54:50,305 --> 00:54:53,093
What a surprise!
Eighth wonder

644
00:54:53,308 --> 00:54:55,265
He's not ready to listen to me.
- But Papa

645
00:54:55,477 --> 00:54:59,425
Shut up! I'm not your papa.
I'm your uncle, son

646
00:54:59,647 --> 00:55:03,094
Here's strawberry milkshake for you.
I'm your uncle

647
00:55:03,485 --> 00:55:06,102
Have it. Uncle is feeding you fruit

648
00:55:06,554 --> 00:55:08,511
Uncle is giving you sandwich

649
00:55:08,757 --> 00:55:11,442
Uncle is giving you biscuits.
Have it, son

650
00:55:11,693 --> 00:55:15,118
Amazing. What a surprise!
Why don't you speak?

651
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:17,412
Speak up! Isn't this a surprise?

652
00:55:20,769 --> 00:55:23,056
Thank God you've come.
- I come everyday

653
00:55:23,271 --> 00:55:25,057
What's so great about it?

654
00:55:25,673 --> 00:55:30,065
Toni was saying Tuk-tuk's father
looks exactly like you

655
00:55:30,378 --> 00:55:32,733
ls it? That's amazing

656
00:55:33,314 --> 00:55:38,070
I'm feeling very queasy about it.
I've seen it in the movies

657
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:43,074
Stop watching movies, okay!
And what are you queasy about?

658
00:55:43,291 --> 00:55:47,410
It's no good. Do you think
I have married Tuk-tuk's mother?

659
00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:52,751
Do you think I'm playing both sides?
Am I such a scoundrel?

660
00:55:53,134 --> 00:55:57,753
Sheru, what are you doing, son?
I've been telling her since morning

661
00:55:58,206 --> 00:56:00,595
that, my son will never do such
a filthy thing

662
00:56:01,576 --> 00:56:04,090
But she hasn't stopped crying
since morning

663
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:14,275
Weeping since morning?

664
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:18,380
)h, you've been weeping since morning
no, don't, Sweety

665
00:56:19,427 --> 00:56:21,043
You are so naive, Sweety

666
00:56:21,629 --> 00:56:24,052
You mustn't relate with movies

667
00:56:24,466 --> 00:56:27,720
Movies run for three hours,
while we have to live a lifetime

668
00:56:29,103 --> 00:56:32,391
Don't be apprehensive it scares me.
- Toni told me

669
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:36,065
The rascal! Come over here

670
00:56:37,479 --> 00:56:40,437
Let the scooter go.
Take off your glasses

671
00:56:40,915 --> 00:56:43,065
Turn that cap
and look into my eyes

672
00:56:44,652 --> 00:56:48,077
Why did you go to Tuk-tuk's?
Didn't I forbid you?

673
00:56:48,490 --> 00:56:52,745
I had gone to pick up my notebook.
I can't break the promise you gave me

674
00:56:53,194 --> 00:56:56,585
You did break the promise, Smart Alec

675
00:57:01,536 --> 00:57:04,426
What's this?
- What? Nothing

676
00:57:04,806 --> 00:57:08,094
Go and play.
- What is it?

677
00:57:08,276 --> 00:57:10,096
Nothing.
- What was Toni saying?

678
00:57:10,278 --> 00:57:11,632
Nothing.
- Show me your hand

679
00:57:11,813 --> 00:57:13,770
Look into my heart, sweetheart

680
00:57:14,549 --> 00:57:17,371
You look great tonight.
Let's go inside, we need to talk

681
00:57:17,619 --> 00:57:21,374
Aren't you ashamed?
- It'll be behind a closed door

682
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:25,378
You look amazing when you are angry.
- Toni was saying

683
00:57:25,593 --> 00:57:27,550
To hell with Toni!
Listen to me..

684
00:57:31,299 --> 00:57:33,415
What? My drawing was
in your papa's palm?

685
00:57:33,835 --> 00:57:37,055
Yes. Looks like your dad
is my dad too

686
00:57:39,774 --> 00:57:42,061
No way. My Papa doesn't lie

687
00:57:42,610 --> 00:57:46,057
That's what I think about my Papa too,
but I have doubts

688
00:57:47,382 --> 00:57:51,774
If it is true, my mummy will
kill herself. She loves him so much

689
00:57:53,354 --> 00:57:56,745
My mummy will kill him.
She too loves him dearly

690
00:57:58,326 --> 00:58:00,283
We must do something about it.
- What?

691
00:58:10,538 --> 00:58:14,463
Toni was insisting that I turn modern
to drop him at school

692
00:58:15,143 --> 00:58:18,397
That's why I bought
fashionable dresses

693
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:25,208
Well Sweaty, since how long
have you known Tom's papa?

694
00:58:26,087 --> 00:58:27,703
Since childhood

695
00:58:28,089 --> 00:58:29,705
Since childhood?

696
00:58:30,158 --> 00:58:32,775
You tell me, how long
have you known Tuk-tuk's papa?

697
00:58:33,795 --> 00:58:38,585
Since my last birth.
- Relationship of lifetimes! Like mine

698
00:58:40,768 --> 00:58:45,057
Do you understand, Toni?
- Looks like Papa has been

699
00:58:45,239 --> 00:58:47,196
playing double roles
since his previous birth

700
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:54,532
He is here.
- Sweety

701
00:58:56,584 --> 00:58:58,063
Sweety

702
00:59:00,288 --> 00:59:03,076
A miracle again? What am I seeing?

703
00:59:04,759 --> 00:59:06,739
Why the hell do they meet?

704
00:59:08,129 --> 00:59:11,087
Oh my God!
He looks exactly like Shekhar

705
00:59:13,134 --> 00:59:17,526
Amazing. Carbon copies.
But

706
00:59:18,139 --> 00:59:20,028
Who's my Toni?

707
00:59:20,608 --> 00:59:23,031
Is it you? Or is it you?

708
00:59:24,412 --> 00:59:26,369
What are you doing?
- What happened?

709
00:59:26,814 --> 00:59:29,374
It's you, Sweety.
The moon behind goggles!

710
00:59:30,084 --> 00:59:33,531
Why are you wearing trendy clothes?
- Toni was insisting

711
00:59:33,755 --> 00:59:37,373
Shut up! Don't blame Toni
for your need for style

712
00:59:38,092 --> 00:59:42,040
Well, you look great. Julia Roberts.
- What are you saying?

713
00:59:42,697 --> 00:59:45,712
I feel like holding you tight
and kissing you

714
00:59:47,902 --> 00:59:52,385
She's my friend Nisha.
- Greetings, Ms Nisha

715
00:59:55,743 --> 00:59:59,395
My son Toni told me that I and
his friend's father look alike

716
00:59:59,614 --> 01:00:04,404
I'm really stunned to see these kids

717
01:00:05,853 --> 01:00:07,742
Now I want to see myself

718
01:00:08,356 --> 01:00:11,405
I mean, I want to see my lookalike.
What's his name?

719
01:00:11,626 --> 01:00:14,084
Shekhar.
- Right. Excuse me, Sweety

720
01:00:14,328 --> 01:00:20,085
ls Nisha, I want to ask you something
Does he really look like me?

721
01:00:20,568 --> 01:00:23,424
Exactly like you.
- It's worrying me

722
01:00:23,705 --> 01:00:26,595
I must meet him.
Why don't you call him? Mr Shekhar!

723
01:00:27,141 --> 01:00:30,099
He's not home. He's in the office.
- I see

724
01:00:31,145 --> 01:00:33,603
How do you know he's in the office?
- She told me

725
01:00:34,148 --> 01:00:37,436
Did she? She must've told you, indeed
That's fine

726
01:00:37,819 --> 01:00:42,108
But it's very sad that I came
to meet him and he's not here

727
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:44,110
Never mind.
- I'm worried

728
01:00:44,292 --> 01:00:48,115
You can meet later. He's in the office
'right now, you can talk over the phone

729
01:00:48,830 --> 01:00:50,787
Great idea. Talk to him
over the phone

730
01:01:06,848 --> 01:01:10,295
I told you to switch off the phone!
- It's for Shekhar. Shall I hang up?

731
01:01:10,685 --> 01:01:12,141
No, don't

732
01:01:14,388 --> 01:01:18,746
Hello?
- Hello, Shekhar? It's me

733
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:23,417
Hi sweetheart. I was about
to call you. Why did you call?

734
01:01:24,665 --> 01:01:29,091
I told you about someone
who resembles you. remember?

735
01:01:29,670 --> 01:01:31,593
Where is he?
Let me talk to him

736
01:01:31,806 --> 01:01:33,763
Hang on, he's here

737
01:01:34,142 --> 01:01:37,100
Please come, he wants to talk to you.
- ls he on the phone?

738
01:01:39,147 --> 01:01:41,104
Hello?
- I cleared the air for you

739
01:01:41,549 --> 01:01:44,632
Your voice is not clear. It's amazing.
I came over to your house

740
01:01:45,153 --> 01:01:48,271
met your son
he looks exactly like my son

741
01:01:48,689 --> 01:01:52,637
'hey resemble so much. I'm so kiddish
- Kiddish?

742
01:01:52,927 --> 01:01:55,783
I mean, I'm so happy.
So, how have you been?

743
01:01:56,464 --> 01:01:59,650
I haven't been paid for three months.
- I know that

744
01:02:00,601 --> 01:02:03,115
My Ma is very sick.
- It's very sad

745
01:02:03,604 --> 01:02:06,118
The roof of my house has crashed.
- That's very good

746
01:02:06,374 --> 01:02:09,457
Very good? I had a buffalo,
and that too vanished

747
01:02:09,811 --> 01:02:14,135
It was likely to happen.
- I have a sister who is still single

748
01:02:14,348 --> 01:02:17,067
At least she must get married.
- I understand, you are very busy

749
01:02:17,385 --> 01:02:20,241
Oh no, I'm absolutely free,
please talk to me

750
01:02:20,521 --> 01:02:23,741
No, we'll talk later, you are busy.
I'll come again. Okay?

751
01:02:25,726 --> 01:02:28,411
For first timers,
you guys really hit it off

752
01:02:28,629 --> 01:02:34,079
He talks so sweet, he's very sweet.
You must be having diabetes then?

753
01:02:34,268 --> 01:02:35,417
Pardon. . f?

754
01:02:36,571 --> 01:02:39,085
Really?
' Okay, bye

755
01:02:39,507 --> 01:02:42,465
Let's go. And take Toni along,
not Tuk-tuk

756
01:02:42,810 --> 01:02:45,427
Why don't you identify him?
- It's easy, both are our kids

757
01:02:45,646 --> 01:02:48,104
let me embrace them.
- I'm always confused

758
01:02:49,150 --> 01:02:51,107
Bye, Ms Nisha.
- Okay, bye

759
01:02:54,856 --> 01:02:57,439
It's been so many days since
I came here, but you are really

760
01:02:57,692 --> 01:03:00,445
I should have time to spare.
- And when will you have that?

761
01:03:01,262 --> 01:03:03,219
I feel as if I'm still
in my village

762
01:03:03,731 --> 01:03:07,781
You are as far away from me
as you were back home

763
01:03:08,302 --> 01:03:12,125
You come home tired in the morning
and then you leave again in the evening

764
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:16,122
I hope you are not working
as a watchman, Papa?

765
01:03:16,811 --> 01:03:19,394
Shut up, little rascal

766
01:03:20,181 --> 01:03:23,071
I mean, he has become ill-mannered
in my company, Ma

767
01:03:23,284 --> 01:03:27,232
But he is right.
Do all writers work at nights?

768
01:03:28,189 --> 01:03:31,079
Ma, you don't understand the ways
of the film industry

769
01:03:31,292 --> 01:03:33,647
All the work is done at night.
Strange ways

770
01:03:34,128 --> 01:03:37,575
What the hell!
The director thinks at night

771
01:03:37,798 --> 01:03:40,756
The writer writes at night,
the producer gets finance at night

772
01:03:41,135 --> 01:03:45,083
the heroine gets ideas at night.
I can't help it. Nights, nights!

773
01:03:46,774 --> 01:03:49,095
Sweety, you don't understand

774
01:03:49,477 --> 01:03:51,593
Actually, I'm stuck in a weird story

775
01:03:52,146 --> 01:03:56,595
Once I decode it,
I'll take you out

776
01:03:57,585 --> 01:04:00,839
Once the two start living together,
I'll be at peace

777
01:04:01,255 --> 01:04:03,212
What do you mean?
Aren't you living together?

778
01:04:03,758 --> 01:04:05,544
No.
- What?

779
01:04:05,726 --> 01:04:09,708
I mean, we are not staying together
all the 24 hours. I'll leave, Ma

780
01:04:09,964 --> 01:04:12,444
Papa, you forgot to wear your shoes

781
01:04:12,767 --> 01:04:16,715
fly darling son, you polished my shoes
What for?

782
01:04:17,238 --> 01:04:21,061
Just like that.
- My son won't do that for no reasons

783
01:04:22,109 --> 01:04:25,397
May I help you wear them?
- No, I'll put it on, on the way

784
01:04:26,847 --> 01:04:28,394
Bye.
- Bye, Papa

785
01:04:30,117 --> 01:04:32,575
Yes, Toni?
- It's done, Tuk-tuk

786
01:04:33,587 --> 01:04:37,069
Good, good.
- I made a mark on his shoes

787
01:04:37,458 --> 01:04:40,576
When your father comes home,
check

788
01:04:41,329 --> 01:04:44,082
if he has the mark on his shoes.
- Okay

789
01:04:44,598 --> 01:04:48,580
If you find the mark, then understand
that our father is two-in-one

790
01:04:48,803 --> 01:04:50,623
Okay. Bye.
- Bye

791
01:04:55,609 --> 01:04:59,091
Papa's yes-man ! How long
will you wait for him? Go to bed

792
01:04:59,814 --> 01:05:02,101
I have very urgent work with Papa

793
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:06,108
Tuk-tuk, my son
- Papa!

794
01:05:08,289 --> 01:05:10,576
You're back?
- No, it's my ghost

795
01:05:11,492 --> 01:05:15,110
Why do you look so tired?
- I was dancing all day in the office

796
01:05:16,764 --> 01:05:20,553
'why don't you give me straight answers
- You are asking crooked questions

797
01:05:20,768 --> 01:05:22,725
Won't a person get tired
after working all day?

798
01:05:23,437 --> 01:05:27,055
Why work so hard? Always working!
You don't have time for me

799
01:05:27,775 --> 01:05:31,063
You come home tired late in the night,
and then you leave early morning

800
01:05:31,779 --> 01:05:34,737
God knows what's wrong with you !
- You come home tired in the night

801
01:05:35,116 --> 01:05:38,734
and then you leave early morning?
Same lines at both the places!

802
01:05:40,121 --> 01:05:42,738
Clever devil. What are you staring at?
- Your shoes

803
01:05:43,124 --> 01:05:46,082
Do you also want to polish them?
- Let me take them off

804
01:05:46,293 --> 01:05:51,083
Really? Why will you take them off?
- My teacher says, there's heaven

805
01:05:51,298 --> 01:05:54,586
at the feet of our parents.
- The teacher seems much interested

806
01:05:55,202 --> 01:05:58,092
When did she tell you that?
- This evening, over the phone

807
01:05:58,572 --> 01:06:01,496
Teaching you over the phone, eh?
All right, take them off

808
01:06:04,145 --> 01:06:06,102
One is helping me wear them,
the other is taking them off

809
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:09,504
ls it time for a shoe-beating?

810
01:06:20,795 --> 01:06:24,379
What is it? Why are you
staring at me? What happened?

811
01:06:24,598 --> 01:06:28,045
Nothing.
- Your tone and your expression

812
01:06:28,269 --> 01:06:32,558
tell me that something's wrong.
What happened?

813
01:06:33,441 --> 01:06:35,557
A lot has happened.
- A lot?

814
01:06:36,610 --> 01:06:39,068
What is he stamping his feet for?

815
01:06:41,348 --> 01:06:43,567
That one did something to the shoes

816
01:06:44,118 --> 01:06:47,076
And this smart one saw something
and says a lot has happened

817
01:06:48,122 --> 01:06:49,601
Something's fishy

818
01:06:55,129 --> 01:06:56,745
Hi Tuk-tuk

819
01:06:57,264 --> 01:06:59,084
Hello Papa.
- Hi

820
01:07:00,134 --> 01:07:02,091
Not papa. Uncle

821
01:07:02,536 --> 01:07:06,086
Not uncle, Papa. We have found out,
you are not different

822
01:07:06,373 --> 01:07:10,094
you are one and the same.
- The two of you are raving

823
01:07:10,578 --> 01:07:15,505
Tuk-tuk drew on his daddy's palm,
how did I find it on my Papa's palm?

824
01:07:18,419 --> 01:07:24,051
Yesterday he made a mark on his daddy
shoes. How did I find it on my Papa's?

825
01:07:25,426 --> 01:07:28,043
It means you are the same
from palm to toe

826
01:07:28,262 --> 01:07:30,219
You are mistaken, son

827
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:34,379
We are not mistaken.
We give you two days

828
01:07:34,668 --> 01:07:38,059
You will tell my mother the truth.
- My mother too

829
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:42,064
Else, we'll expose you.
- Really?

830
01:07:42,843 --> 01:07:45,596
After two days
you will expose me?

831
01:07:46,113 --> 01:07:47,592
Yes, we will

832
01:07:48,582 --> 01:07:50,402
Save my masquerade

833
01:07:52,419 --> 01:07:54,069
Save my masquerade

834
01:07:55,789 --> 01:07:59,407
Save my masquerade!
- Shekhar

835
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:03,085
Stop hanging like Damocles' sword
over my head. Sit

836
01:08:03,797 --> 01:08:05,413
I got an idea.
- Who?

837
01:08:05,633 --> 01:08:07,089
I got.
- Clear it

838
01:08:07,301 --> 01:08:09,087
If only you let me speak.
- Go ahead

839
01:08:09,236 --> 01:08:14,754
Thank you. Shekhar, if your wives see
their husbands together

840
01:08:15,142 --> 01:08:20,034
How? Explain it. Shekhar is not
a film scene that we can copy

841
01:08:20,247 --> 01:08:22,033
It's so confusing. Make it clear.
- I'm the director

842
01:08:22,216 --> 01:08:24,173
I'll shoot them in double role,
it'll save his masquerade

843
01:08:25,252 --> 01:08:28,210
But Shekhar, it'll be expensive

844
01:08:29,456 --> 01:08:34,041
I'd rather spend than earn infamy

845
01:08:34,528 --> 01:08:39,546
Mr Chelaramani, my sons
are smarter than me

846
01:08:41,101 --> 01:08:44,583
It's a matter of pride but I don't know
Why it hurts. Please save my masquerade

847
01:08:46,774 --> 01:08:48,731
Save my masquerade.
- It'll be fine

848
01:08:50,644 --> 01:08:55,070
Ms Nisha, you should've come to
the party, you'd have had such fun

849
01:08:55,816 --> 01:08:58,740
Your husband and I had
so much fun

850
01:08:59,119 --> 01:09:05,070
the entire party was left gaping
with their eyes wide open

851
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:08,579
Their voice went digital.
- Really?

852
01:09:08,796 --> 01:09:12,084
And what happens later is the
funniest thing I've ever seen

853
01:09:12,333 --> 01:09:16,088
The two of us saw ourselves
standing right before us

854
01:09:16,370 --> 01:09:18,691
Four of you?
- Yes, four

855
01:09:19,340 --> 01:09:25,029
Then I saw a video camera on.
We were actually on a video screen

856
01:09:25,613 --> 01:09:28,036
That's when I realised that
it was a stealth shot

857
01:09:28,816 --> 01:09:33,037
Really?
- Since it was amazing, I thought

858
01:09:33,254 --> 01:09:35,211
of giving you a recorded cassette.
Shall I play it for you?

859
01:09:35,756 --> 01:09:39,044
Sure.
- I'll show you. Just watch

860
01:09:39,493 --> 01:09:43,043
So you took the video guy
along with you, eh?

861
01:09:43,597 --> 01:09:46,055
Smart Alec

862
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:49,390
Ms Nisha, your son is amazing

863
01:09:50,504 --> 01:09:53,724
You must've seen a lot of detective
movies while you were pregnant, I guest

864
01:09:54,308 --> 01:09:57,130
He's just the size of a carrot,
but he's a self-styled detective

865
01:10:00,748 --> 01:10:05,731
When you go to grand parties,
you don't take the video guys along

866
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:10,068
So just watch
and pass no comments

867
01:10:10,524 --> 01:10:12,413
Enjoy the video

868
01:10:18,232 --> 01:10:20,087
That's funny

869
01:10:20,534 --> 01:10:22,081
Oh my God

870
01:10:22,569 --> 01:10:25,288
Which means even your son Tuk-tuk
suspects you?

871
01:10:26,206 --> 01:10:29,096
And why not? He's Nisha's son

872
01:10:32,513 --> 01:10:36,097
But why does he suspect that
the two of us are one and the same?

873
01:10:38,819 --> 01:10:42,608
He said he'll expose me.
- Expose?

874
01:10:43,657 --> 01:10:48,276
If the two of them see us talking to
each other, they will be left gaping

875
01:10:50,497 --> 01:10:54,252
In fact, all the four will be
left gaping. Count the big girls too

876
01:11:00,174 --> 01:11:02,131
Anything to say, Tuk-tuk?
- No, but I want to

877
01:11:02,343 --> 01:11:04,300
show you something.
Toni

878
01:11:08,849 --> 01:11:12,797
Pirated cassettes of "Twins" and
"Duplicate" ? What does that mean?

879
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:16,745
In Duplicate there were
two Shah Rukh Khans

880
01:11:17,157 --> 01:11:19,080
But are there really
two Shah Rukh Khans?

881
01:11:19,326 --> 01:11:23,513
And in Twins, there were two
'Salman Khans. But are there really two

882
01:11:24,131 --> 01:11:26,088
But you guys are two

883
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:29,087
Yes, and we are seen together

884
01:11:34,341 --> 01:11:40,098
We can shake hands, wring ears,
even hug each other

885
01:11:40,481 --> 01:11:45,567
Why don't we see you guys together?
- Why don't we see you guys together'

886
01:11:51,158 --> 01:11:53,115
Your daddy is a busy man

887
01:11:53,761 --> 01:11:56,446
Your daddy is a big man,
he has no time to spare

888
01:11:57,164 --> 01:11:59,587
As for me, I have enough time

889
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:04,455
Ms Nisha, I'm taking this no more.
Next time, tell Shekhu to be present

890
01:12:04,671 --> 01:12:07,129
Shekhu?
- Shekhar. He's my friend now

891
01:12:07,708 --> 01:12:12,134
From now on, we will play together,
hold our noses, wring our ears

892
01:12:12,346 --> 01:12:15,134
hug each other
we'll do everything together

893
01:12:17,317 --> 01:12:20,070
But how? And when?

894
01:12:21,655 --> 01:12:22,736
Ma!

895
01:12:23,557 --> 01:12:25,514
Sire you remember me?

896
01:12:27,694 --> 01:12:30,083
Yes, you remember me.
I'm the one with two wives

897
01:12:30,464 --> 01:12:33,616
As you said I'll be married twice,
I am

898
01:12:34,468 --> 01:12:38,086
But these days, I'm in trouble.
- Don't consider it to be trouble

899
01:12:38,338 --> 01:12:41,296
Please explain. If this is
not trouble, is it a joke then?

900
01:12:41,508 --> 01:12:48,096
This is not trouble. This is what
you movie people call a trailer

901
01:12:48,649 --> 01:12:53,098
The real trouble is yet to come.
Soon

902
01:12:53,687 --> 01:12:54,768
Ominous

903
01:12:55,689 --> 01:12:59,785
Sire, my life has become
a documentary on earthquakes

904
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:03,278
And you say it's just a trailer.
So what lies ahead?

905
01:13:03,697 --> 01:13:06,450
You will know when it hits you, son

906
01:13:07,568 --> 01:13:09,457
You will know

907
01:13:10,504 --> 01:13:12,120
You will know then

908
01:13:13,607 --> 01:13:17,396
Why did he keep repeating it?
A tempest is approaching I guess

909
01:13:17,644 --> 01:13:21,069
I must do something.
How many more acts will you perform

910
01:13:21,281 --> 01:13:23,238
For Nisha, you are right now
If Shekhar is to fly in

911
01:13:26,487 --> 01:13:28,785
Sher Singh must go somewhere.
- Where?

912
01:13:28,789 --> 01:13:30,439
Thank you

913
01:13:31,558 --> 01:13:34,072
The flight from Singapore has landed,
he should be here now

914
01:13:34,495 --> 01:13:37,419
I'll leave now. It's also time
for Tom's papa to arrive

915
01:13:39,633 --> 01:13:43,080
What are you doing here? Have you
planned to stay here for good?

916
01:13:43,370 --> 01:13:46,089
Oh no, I was actually leaving
- Never mind, I'm here

917
01:13:46,707 --> 01:13:49,096
Actually, I'm going on a trip to Goa
for fifteen days

918
01:13:49,510 --> 01:13:51,433
I thought of meeting my wife
before leaving

919
01:13:52,145 --> 01:13:54,102
A new excuse

920
01:13:54,548 --> 01:13:57,108
See you. Take care.
- Bye

921
01:13:58,151 --> 01:14:01,633
Hi carbon copies! What are you
copying from each other?

922
01:14:02,189 --> 01:14:05,113
No, we are making maps

923
01:14:05,325 --> 01:14:09,114
I'm drawing Singapore
while he's mapping Goa

924
01:14:10,597 --> 01:14:12,452
These boys are devils

925
01:14:13,233 --> 01:14:17,386
Bye Sweety. Bye, Ms Nisha.
- Mr Sher Singh, please wait a while

926
01:14:17,604 --> 01:14:19,720
our friend should be here any moment
- No, I'm going by car

927
01:14:20,107 --> 01:14:24,556
Have to negotiate the hills, you see.
- Yes mummy, he has to go

928
01:14:24,811 --> 01:14:28,065
If he doesn't go,
how will he return?

929
01:14:29,650 --> 01:14:32,073
So confusing.
It's not very clear

930
01:14:32,486 --> 01:14:35,444
Moron ! If Sher Singh doesn't leave,
how will Shekhar return?

931
01:14:36,623 --> 01:14:38,079
What are you guys trying to say?

932
01:14:38,292 --> 01:14:42,081
My Papa leaves
and returns as his papa

933
01:14:43,830 --> 01:14:45,787
I never noticed this before

934
01:14:46,233 --> 01:14:50,215
You are unnecessarily taking
the kids seriously, Ms Nisha

935
01:14:51,705 --> 01:14:55,096
Such coincidences happen sometimes.
- Not sometimes

936
01:14:56,143 --> 01:14:57,759
It always happens

937
01:15:00,314 --> 01:15:02,430
I think you must stay back today

938
01:15:02,849 --> 01:15:06,103
What are you saying, Sweety?
If I stay back, who will earn bread?

939
01:15:06,553 --> 01:15:09,113
I'm not asking you to wait a lifetime.
Please wait for a while

940
01:15:09,489 --> 01:15:12,447
Sweety
- You're not going to miss the train

941
01:15:12,693 --> 01:15:15,116
You're going to Goa by car,
you could drive a trifle faster

942
01:15:15,329 --> 01:15:18,720
I don't mind driving fast,
I don't have a problem

943
01:15:19,166 --> 01:15:24,058
Mr Chelaramani is scared of the hills,
he gets uneasy travelling at nights

944
01:15:25,472 --> 01:15:30,057
Sir, you said you are an all-rounder,
how come the hills make you uneasy?

945
01:15:31,278 --> 01:15:32,598
Please explain

946
01:15:32,779 --> 01:15:37,569
Hill rides make him puke
Sher Singh, why do you make excuse:

947
01:15:38,218 --> 01:15:41,074
Wait for a while, he'll be here now.
Let's sit together and enjoy

948
01:15:41,622 --> 01:15:45,411
Why'd I make excuses? I also
want to enjoy. It's their problem

949
01:15:45,659 --> 01:15:48,617
They are busy guys. Ask them

950
01:15:48,795 --> 01:15:50,615
As you wish, guys. Tell me

951
01:15:51,131 --> 01:15:55,079
Well, let's all enjoy.
- Yes, let's enjoy

952
01:15:55,302 --> 01:15:57,418
We can't enjoy!
- Why not? Explain

953
01:15:57,804 --> 01:16:02,093
My film is already delayed by 7 years.
If it is delayed more, I'll die

954
01:16:02,876 --> 01:16:05,595
You have taken 7 years
to complete 7 reels

955
01:16:05,812 --> 01:16:07,769
A delay of seven hours
will not harm you

956
01:16:08,515 --> 01:16:10,438
Besides, it's the duty of the father
to clear the children's suspicion

957
01:16:10,651 --> 01:16:14,098
Don't blame the children
for your suspicion

958
01:16:14,688 --> 01:16:17,373
Don't take undue advantage
of my leniency

959
01:16:17,591 --> 01:16:21,380
And don't try to be an obstacle
in my path. The name is Sher Singh

960
01:16:21,795 --> 01:16:25,379
That doesn't give you the right
to always roar and shut me up

961
01:16:26,266 --> 01:16:29,224
Let me see how you go out today.
Implore you ! For the sake of your son

962
01:16:31,104 --> 01:16:33,061
Are you trying to put me in a bind?

963
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:36,057
Not trying, I am doing it.
- For the sake of my son?

964
01:16:36,276 --> 01:16:38,062
Yes!
- All right then

965
01:16:38,378 --> 01:16:39,561
Yes! Yes!

966
01:16:39,846 --> 01:16:43,737
All right, no problem.
It's all right

967
01:16:44,651 --> 01:16:48,076
It's all right.
I'm bound by an oath

968
01:17:20,587 --> 01:17:24,034
Lord, please save me
from this calamity

969
01:17:25,625 --> 01:17:27,582
Else, I'll drop dead

970
01:18:32,459 --> 01:18:35,042
Who the bloody hell are you?

971
01:18:36,263 --> 01:18:39,051
Who the hell are you ?

972
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:42,558
Me? What a thing to ask. I'm me.
Shekhar. Nisha's husband and

973
01:18:43,103 --> 01:18:44,582
this house is mine

974
01:18:46,239 --> 01:18:51,063
Nisha look what's wrong with
Sher Singh. He asks me, who I am

975
01:18:54,114 --> 01:18:58,062
I'm not joking and you better get
serious and tell us who you are

976
01:18:58,285 --> 01:19:03,075
And what for are you here ?
- Why does a man come home ?

977
01:19:04,291 --> 01:19:08,080
This house is mine, it's my wife and
my kids. Now what's your act?

978
01:19:08,495 --> 01:19:10,748
You've gone mad ?

979
01:19:11,631 --> 01:19:16,523
Nisha, darling where are you ?
- Oh-ho ! He calls my wife that !

980
01:19:16,803 --> 01:19:19,022
I'm going to carve you up

981
01:19:19,739 --> 01:19:22,356
in a hundred pieces
and I'll feed you to the vultures

982
01:19:22,809 --> 01:19:27,030
Mr Sher Singh, mind your language !
How can you become so abusive ?

983
01:19:28,081 --> 01:19:31,528
Never mind his language,
you know what Sher Singh just said ?

984
01:19:31,818 --> 01:19:37,040
Oh I'm too angry to talk about it.
Rather Sher Singh,

985
01:19:37,424 --> 01:19:41,713
what you've dared to say to me,
let's see you telling my wife

986
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:48,056
Speak

987
01:19:48,468 --> 01:19:51,051
Why don't you speak ?
What have you been telling him ?

988
01:19:54,641 --> 01:19:57,064
Sweety Oh Sweety

989
01:19:59,145 --> 01:20:05,073
Nisha, I'm Sher Singh and I am Shekha
and I'm husband to both of you

990
01:20:07,921 --> 01:20:09,070
Sher Singh !

991
01:20:10,523 --> 01:20:13,572
We're amiable folks, but it doesn't mean
we'll let you get away: with insulting us

992
01:20:14,327 --> 01:20:18,082
Good lady, before I do something nasty
take your husband away

993
01:20:18,398 --> 01:20:20,082
Else, what would you do ?
- Get out

994
01:20:20,267 --> 01:20:22,087
Get out of my house

995
01:20:22,302 --> 01:20:24,589
Shut up ! And listen to me, Nisha

996
01:20:25,171 --> 01:20:27,754
He is a cunning and dangerous impostor

997
01:20:28,341 --> 01:20:31,424
He wants to use my helplessness
and he wants to usurp my place

998
01:20:32,345 --> 01:20:37,101
Listen please, I think you're ill.
- Shut up, nothings ill about me

999
01:20:37,684 --> 01:20:40,767
But why don't I make him ill,
let me break this chameleons legs

1000
01:20:41,588 --> 01:20:46,446
Good lady, now this is too much !
One more minute and I'll call the police

1001
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:49,115
And what will the police do ?
- Shut up, silly

1002
01:20:49,329 --> 01:20:51,445
I'm calling the police

1003
01:20:55,635 --> 01:21:02,120
True, I ask for clarifications, be it
anything. But for a change, I'm clear

1004
01:21:02,442 --> 01:21:05,628
He is Sher Singh. He is Shekhar.
He's husband to both these women

1005
01:21:05,845 --> 01:21:07,665
And he's the writer
of our film. Clear ?

1006
01:21:07,847 --> 01:21:09,804
I see, film company-wallahs ?

1007
01:21:10,183 --> 01:21:11,139
Yes !

1008
01:21:11,384 --> 01:21:14,638
And now this fraud invades
the writer's life

1009
01:21:15,522 --> 01:21:19,413
So you clear out this fraud, quick.
- Quick ?

1010
01:21:22,762 --> 01:21:24,082
That never came clear

1011
01:21:24,331 --> 01:21:26,754
Never play with Pange. Clear ?

1012
01:21:27,133 --> 01:21:28,419
No, abundantly clear

1013
01:21:28,635 --> 01:21:32,424
You know him that long to be guarantor
- No ! I don't even know him

1014
01:21:32,706 --> 01:21:37,098
He's the one who'll vouch for him, he's
the writer's employer vouch for him

1015
01:21:37,477 --> 01:21:41,095
What are you saying ! How can I vouch
for him, I barely know him. Period

1016
01:21:42,148 --> 01:21:45,106
for how long five years ?
- I know nothing

1017
01:21:45,752 --> 01:21:47,607
What've I known him for 5-7 years

1018
01:21:48,321 --> 01:21:50,107
Mark my words
- One minute

1019
01:21:50,824 --> 01:21:54,613
What proof that you are Shekhar ?

1020
01:21:55,195 --> 01:21:58,119
What proof that you are Pange ?

1021
01:22:00,166 --> 01:22:06,117
Do you see two of me ? No, right?
Answer, what proof have you ?

1022
01:22:07,974 --> 01:22:13,128
Aw about someone who was my landlady
before I married Nisha ?

1023
01:22:15,548 --> 01:22:18,563
How about my boss who owned
the car showroom where I worked ?

1024
01:22:20,620 --> 01:22:24,067
Oh yes, here's my Singapore ticket

1025
01:22:25,825 --> 01:22:29,216
And my passport,
at least you won't find it flawed

1026
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:35,416
Excuse me

1027
01:22:39,139 --> 01:22:41,619
Not his ! It's my passport ! I don't
know how it came to be with him

1028
01:22:43,777 --> 01:22:47,099
And I had no plans of visiting
Singapore, I was lying to Nisha

1029
01:22:47,313 --> 01:22:50,760
Look, you are making lame excuses.
Still, I give you one more chance

1030
01:22:51,184 --> 01:22:55,109
-lave you any proof of being Shekhar
- Have I

1031
01:22:57,323 --> 01:22:59,109
I have.
- Show me

1032
01:23:00,527 --> 01:23:01,813
I have my proof !

1033
01:23:02,162 --> 01:23:06,110
Tuk-tuk, you remember marking my arr
and Tony spied you. And Tony

1034
01:23:06,366 --> 01:23:11,793
nu marked my shoe and Tuk-tuk knew
You remember ? Tell him, tell him

1035
01:23:12,505 --> 01:23:15,463
Say it.
- Mister, don't psyche the kids

1036
01:23:16,776 --> 01:23:18,733
If you have solid evidence,
the talk about it

1037
01:23:19,846 --> 01:23:22,565
Solid evidence diary !

1038
01:23:23,116 --> 01:23:27,405
He night when Nisha's daddy was killer
I confessed to him about my bigamy

1039
01:23:27,921 --> 01:23:29,741
And he wrote it down in his diary

1040
01:23:30,623 --> 01:23:32,773
I'll show you the diary ! Now!

1041
01:23:35,328 --> 01:23:39,424
Excuse me Madam is it true that
your Daddy wrote diaries ?

1042
01:23:40,133 --> 01:23:43,091
Yes, Daddy wrote his diaries everyday

1043
01:23:44,671 --> 01:23:47,754
Look, this diary is proof of my honesty

1044
01:23:48,508 --> 01:23:52,092
oak, we got married on June 16. Read
- Show me

1045
01:23:53,813 --> 01:23:57,101
Tl happy, my daughter Nisha is married

1046
01:23:57,750 --> 01:24:02,108
Shekhar is such a gentleman,
he loves only Nisha

1047
01:24:03,156 --> 01:24:05,238
Today, I have a son,
my son-in-law

1048
01:24:09,829 --> 01:24:12,446
There's nothing in it,
like what you say

1049
01:24:13,633 --> 01:24:15,317
He even switched the diaries !

1050
01:24:15,702 --> 01:24:17,716
I even copied the handwriting
of a long-dead man ?

1051
01:24:18,471 --> 01:24:22,396
This man came after loads of planning
he did big-time planning

1052
01:24:22,609 --> 01:24:27,467
her Singh, step floundering and get 01
or else, I'll have to arrest you

1053
01:24:28,448 --> 01:24:33,067
Are you dying to go to jail ?
- Hold on a minute, he's threatening

1054
01:24:33,286 --> 01:24:36,074
Doesn't mean he has got me, has he ?
he's playing cop, it means, I'm thief?

1055
01:24:36,422 --> 01:24:38,402
No !
- My last point. If he is Shekhar,

1056
01:24:38,791 --> 01:24:43,410
let him give the combination to the lock
in the safe. Only Nisha and I know it

1057
01:24:43,663 --> 01:24:45,711
Have the scoundrel speak ! Speak

1058
01:24:46,232 --> 01:24:48,087
38492

1059
01:24:51,638 --> 01:24:53,094
Damn you

1060
01:24:55,842 --> 01:24:57,458
What's he, man or bug ?

1061
01:24:57,810 --> 01:25:02,099
- Low did this creep get under my skin'.
Get out, vanish

1062
01:25:02,682 --> 01:25:04,639
A spy destroyed my life?

1063
01:25:04,851 --> 01:25:06,433
Shut up !

1064
01:25:06,819 --> 01:25:10,107
'You're Shekhar, are you ? The property
the business are all yours ?

1065
01:25:10,690 --> 01:25:15,446
What's your turnover for the year ?
- Who cares for figures

1066
01:25:15,662 --> 01:25:21,055
I don't care, I'm a fun-loving Punjabi,
I eat, drink and make merry

1067
01:25:21,601 --> 01:25:23,558
Accounting is Mr Rae's job

1068
01:25:26,773 --> 01:25:33,065
Officer ! There's one man !
One man can unravel this conspiracy

1069
01:25:33,279 --> 01:25:35,065
Our accountant, Mr Rao

1070
01:25:35,915 --> 01:25:40,398
nu mean, I kept Nisha in the dark about
something as grave as your other woman

1071
01:25:40,853 --> 01:25:42,400
How preposterous

1072
01:25:42,789 --> 01:25:44,575
Are you in your senses ?

1073
01:25:45,792 --> 01:25:46,748
Nisha

1074
01:25:47,493 --> 01:25:49,416
I'm not that bad ?
- You're worse

1075
01:25:49,929 --> 01:25:52,409
This chameleon bought you out !
I'll kill you

1076
01:25:53,132 --> 01:25:55,123
I'm going to kill you

1077
01:25:55,134 --> 01:25:57,421
I won't spare you.
- Back off. No manhandling

1078
01:25:57,770 --> 01:26:00,091
It's a conspiracy to trap me

1079
01:26:01,140 --> 01:26:05,429
And I I've one last proof,

1080
01:26:06,346 --> 01:26:08,303
to establish my bonafides

1081
01:26:08,815 --> 01:26:12,536
one last resort ! I'll go to any extent
but I won't lie when I swear by my kid

1082
01:26:14,687 --> 01:26:17,577
I swear, I am Sher Singh
and I am Shekhar, too

1083
01:26:21,427 --> 01:26:24,385
I too, swear by my son, I am Shekhar

1084
01:26:26,633 --> 01:26:29,421
Beware.
- He swears falsely upon my son's life

1085
01:26:30,103 --> 01:26:33,061
Enough. No playing with Pange

1086
01:26:35,475 --> 01:26:38,558
Trying to enter their homes or offices
s no good for you anymore, ever again

1087
01:26:42,749 --> 01:26:48,233
Sweety oi Sweety !
Where is your mother gone ?

1088
01:26:50,189 --> 01:26:52,749
You did not stop her ?
Oh Sweety!

1089
01:26:56,129 --> 01:26:59,417
Oh, I am ruined !
Oh, what a liar you were

1090
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:04,425
All those nights you went after her,
on the pretext of story-sittings

1091
01:27:04,604 --> 01:27:06,754
Sweety !
- What a fool I was !

1092
01:27:06,873 --> 01:27:08,489
Sweety !
- Your Sweety is dead !

1093
01:27:08,675 --> 01:27:12,100
No ! I'll never let you do that !
Let go of it

1094
01:27:12,512 --> 01:27:14,469
Let me !
- I was such a fool !

1095
01:27:14,681 --> 01:27:18,367
Let go of the stove.
- I won't let you commit suicide

1096
01:27:18,818 --> 01:27:23,369
I still got to cook dinner, let go.
- I imagined you'd kill yourself

1097
01:27:23,589 --> 01:27:27,537
It'd land my mother in jail.
- For what sin will I kill myself?

1098
01:27:28,828 --> 01:27:37,054
God ! I thought you were a superhero,
you turned out to be a philanderer

1099
01:27:37,270 --> 01:27:40,388
No Sweety, I'm not !
- Sweety, what a terrible thing to say

1100
01:27:41,107 --> 01:27:46,056
What has the dear boy done ?
- That you ask the boy you trusted

1101
01:27:46,546 --> 01:27:52,440
You will despair !
- My Sharon, what we you done ?

1102
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:57,738
Why don't I hear your voice ?
- Because his heart isn't in it

1103
01:27:58,491 --> 01:28:01,609
My son's father says,
he has two wives

1104
01:28:01,861 --> 01:28:04,341
What !
- Oh God !

1105
01:28:04,564 --> 01:28:07,522
He has two wives !
- Yes ?

1106
01:28:08,134 --> 01:28:10,091
And that boy who resembles Tony
- Oh yes!

1107
01:28:10,570 --> 01:28:15,087
He is his son ! Nisha, the other woman
- Oh !

1108
01:28:22,682 --> 01:28:24,696
Oh God !
- Mother !

1109
01:28:26,285 --> 01:28:31,371
Oh God ! What've I done ?
I never imagined it'd come to this

1110
01:28:32,525 --> 01:28:38,544
Mother ! Don't punish me so harshly
for so small a wrong. Ma, hit me !

1111
01:28:39,098 --> 01:28:42,056
Slap me ! Give me a thrashing,
but please, don't leave me

1112
01:28:42,468 --> 01:28:44,425
Please don't leave me, Ma

1113
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:57,063
Son ! Where are you ?

1114
01:29:11,552 --> 01:29:12,508
You?

1115
01:29:12,719 --> 01:29:15,177
Oh Nisha, dearest wife !

1116
01:29:18,692 --> 01:29:25,780
Nisha you pushed me away ?
Look at me,

1117
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:29,618
I'm your Shekhar, Tuk-tuk's Papa.
- No

1118
01:29:29,837 --> 01:29:37,130
For your sake, I renounced a world of
women. The law might ask for proof

1119
01:29:37,344 --> 01:29:42,134
but how can you not know who I am ?
Nisha !

1120
01:29:44,852 --> 01:29:46,672
How dare you step in here

1121
01:29:51,525 --> 01:29:53,141
Keep your voice down

1122
01:29:54,628 --> 01:29:56,483
You don't see ?
Husband and wife are talking

1123
01:29:56,730 --> 01:29:58,152
Throw him out

1124
01:29:59,566 --> 01:30:01,148
You cannot throw me out

1125
01:30:01,535 --> 01:30:03,151
Put that stick away

1126
01:30:03,871 --> 01:30:05,828
I'm going away, you needn't

1127
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:07,821
Back off

1128
01:30:08,208 --> 01:30:14,602
And you Nisha hear me out.
No impostor can be a lover

1129
01:30:18,218 --> 01:30:21,643
Nisha, your eyes can be fooled.
But in your heart, you'll always know

1130
01:30:24,725 --> 01:30:26,682
Nisha, you are being defrauded

1131
01:30:27,761 --> 01:30:29,616
Beware of this impostor

1132
01:30:29,963 --> 01:30:31,783
Take care

1133
01:30:34,935 --> 01:30:36,892
He won't relent, will he ?

1134
01:30:37,437 --> 01:30:39,189
I forbid you from coming here

1135
01:30:40,407 --> 01:30:42,364
Put him in the slammer.
- Wait a minute

1136
01:30:44,511 --> 01:30:49,699
No policeman can cuff Sher Singh

1137
01:30:50,517 --> 01:30:54,704
What's so different about you ?
- I'm willing, why should you drag me '

1138
01:30:54,988 --> 01:30:56,808
I'm coming, let's get talking

1139
01:30:56,990 --> 01:30:58,708
As for you!

1140
01:31:07,601 --> 01:31:08,887
You two?

1141
01:31:11,271 --> 01:31:12,750
What's that get-up ?

1142
01:31:12,973 --> 01:31:16,625
He other day, we watched you in action
So, our reaction

1143
01:31:17,210 --> 01:31:21,158
Your fists speak faster than words,
so we thought we needed protection

1144
01:31:21,481 --> 01:31:25,167
What's your business here ?
- To bail out Sher Singh

1145
01:31:26,954 --> 01:31:30,174
No ! He isn't much of an acquaintance'
- Go on

1146
01:31:30,791 --> 01:31:34,648
Between men, it's a duty, no?
To help one another?

1147
01:31:37,598 --> 01:31:38,554
Sit

1148
01:31:38,899 --> 01:31:40,856
Smiled, is snared.
- Tea for my guests

1149
01:31:41,702 --> 01:31:44,182
Say, Sher Singh is Shekhar ?

1150
01:31:44,905 --> 01:31:48,193
Yes. One and the same.
- The same

1151
01:31:48,375 --> 01:31:52,858
But I can't give a guarantee.
How can I stand guarantee for a man

1152
01:31:53,246 --> 01:31:54,862
Absolutely clear

1153
01:31:56,650 --> 01:31:58,197
Fetch Sher Singh

1154
01:32:03,690 --> 01:32:06,375
Sher Singh, you're out on bail,
don't think you're free

1155
01:32:06,860 --> 01:32:08,715
What else, if not free ?

1156
01:32:09,630 --> 01:32:12,554
Sher Singh, I want to help.
- Sure

1157
01:32:12,733 --> 01:32:14,713
Because I think you're honest.
- Indeed

1158
01:32:15,802 --> 01:32:21,161
But you can't enter Nisha's house.
- What if I use the backdoor ?

1159
01:32:21,575 --> 01:32:25,159
You got no way in, you just cannot.
- What kind of contention is that ?

1160
01:32:26,513 --> 01:32:30,666
What kind of choice have I ?
- Over here this Shekhar

1161
01:32:31,885 --> 01:32:34,172
You know, this Shekhar
Not Shekhar, he's not a bloody Shekha

1162
01:32:35,222 --> 01:32:37,179
I'm both Shekhar and Sher Singh.
He's masquerading

1163
01:32:37,557 --> 01:32:40,174
He has links to the top brass.
- The top brass is involved ?

1164
01:32:40,394 --> 01:32:47,187
Yes. I've orders to handle this case
very strictly. So my hands are tied

1165
01:32:47,567 --> 01:32:52,687
Strange, the hands of the law, tied ?
And the hands of criminals, untied ?

1166
01:32:52,906 --> 01:32:56,194
And the public at large, crippled.
I mean, public interest is sacrificed

1167
01:32:56,576 --> 01:33:00,194
And no one dares touch the ones who
lot their hands in the whole damn soul

1168
01:33:00,414 --> 01:33:01,734
So whose is the hand ?
- Hand ?

1169
01:33:01,915 --> 01:33:06,705
I mean, the complicity of it
Oh forget it and think it this way

1170
01:33:06,987 --> 01:33:10,571
the police, and I mean you, wish to
help a man in trouble, no ?

1171
01:33:10,791 --> 01:33:13,214
Yes and ?
- May I make throw a suggestion ?

1172
01:33:13,427 --> 01:33:16,215
Say it.
- Finish him, in a fake encounter

1173
01:33:17,197 --> 01:33:21,486
No, don't be cross, I've one more option
I can kill him, you get me off the hook

1174
01:33:24,571 --> 01:33:26,460
Get off my table

1175
01:33:28,575 --> 01:33:30,361
Like this ?

1176
01:33:31,378 --> 01:33:34,166
You take him away, now,
or I'll arrest both of you

1177
01:33:34,581 --> 01:33:36,504
Did I suggest the impossible ?

1178
01:33:38,418 --> 01:33:40,671
Listen, get me a tea.
- Yes sir

1179
01:33:41,621 --> 01:33:43,578
And a pill for a headache.
- Sure sir

1180
01:33:48,140 --> 01:33:49,392
Mr Shekhar

1181
01:33:49,641 --> 01:33:51,723
Hi, here we are.
- Welcome

1182
01:33:52,444 --> 01:33:54,401
Here you go.
- The cheque cashed ?

1183
01:33:54,580 --> 01:33:57,561
You forged the signature beautifully,
no one even suspected

1184
01:34:02,521 --> 01:34:05,570
One more cheque for 500,000. Sign it.
- One more ?

1185
01:34:06,058 --> 01:34:11,918
The boss says, no problem, go ahead.
- Aren't you being too greedy ?

1186
01:34:12,564 --> 01:34:14,749
Considering the risks, no

1187
01:34:16,969 --> 01:34:18,425
Papa, ball

1188
01:34:18,904 --> 01:34:19,860
Shut up

1189
01:34:20,739 --> 01:34:22,753
How many times I've told you
not to barge in when we're talking

1190
01:34:24,710 --> 01:34:26,428
And what good are you, governess ?

1191
01:34:28,047 --> 01:34:30,004
Get out of here

1192
01:34:31,483 --> 01:34:32,769
Come, Tuk-tuk

1193
01:34:41,193 --> 01:34:49,055
Bravo, true sons of Sher Singh !
But how did you find out he's not me 1

1194
01:34:49,701 --> 01:34:56,061
That man smokes cigarettes. And you
hate cigarettes like Mummy hates you

1195
01:34:56,508 --> 01:35:02,402
do wisecracks, smart aleck. Don't rub I
and put your minds together and thin

1196
01:35:02,581 --> 01:35:07,906
My mind isn't working.
- How about stealing his cigarettes ?

1197
01:35:08,887 --> 01:35:14,576
Smoking can be proof for the police ?
Ho use. He has smoked out every pro:

1198
01:35:14,860 --> 01:35:19,411
'his villain hides behind a smokescreen
I got to blow that smokescreen

1199
01:35:19,998 --> 01:35:28,759
It you must handle your mummy for me
my prestige is in your hands

1200
01:35:29,908 --> 01:35:34,141
Papa, don't worry !
His every song

1201
01:35:34,146 --> 01:35:36,035
I'll turn into sorrow.
- Bravo !

1202
01:36:05,444 --> 01:36:07,401
You and I and solitude

1203
01:36:07,846 --> 01:36:09,894
Am I in a soup ?

1204
01:36:10,449 --> 01:36:12,133
Come into my embrace

1205
01:36:12,618 --> 01:36:14,473
Please, I need some space

1206
01:36:14,753 --> 01:36:18,405
The air is charged with Iowa's musk
and my; heart

1207
01:36:19,091 --> 01:36:21,412
is gone wild

1208
01:36:21,793 --> 01:36:22,749
Wild

1209
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:12,388
Awakening, of myriad emotions

1210
01:37:13,178 --> 01:37:16,569
warn a flaring of storm

1211
01:37:32,931 --> 01:37:34,888
Please, relent

1212
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:37,057
Please, desist

1213
01:37:42,474 --> 01:37:45,557
Waiting, is more endearing,

1214
01:37:46,545 --> 01:37:48,502
let the longing linger

1215
01:38:33,225 --> 01:38:41,588
Every breath torments
- Wait, a few more moments

1216
01:39:02,421 --> 01:39:06,437
If only I can touch you
- You're touched

1217
01:39:07,025 --> 01:39:10,882
What's tiring, my love

1218
01:39:11,496 --> 01:39:15,387
is this endless yearning

1219
01:39:16,968 --> 01:39:21,394
You and I and solitude.
- What a terrible soup

1220
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:26,391
Come into my embrace.
- Please, now I need some space

1221
01:39:26,645 --> 01:39:30,400
The air is charged with Iowa's musk
and my; heart

1222
01:39:30,716 --> 01:39:32,400
is gone wild

1223
01:39:33,185 --> 01:39:34,141
Wild

1224
01:39:40,625 --> 01:39:44,550
How clever, bravo !

1225
01:39:44,863 --> 01:39:48,345
What a job you've done !
Now, how about some ideas,

1226
01:39:48,567 --> 01:39:53,516
if you don't mind. This torture
has left me disturbed in the mind

1227
01:39:53,972 --> 01:39:58,899
You guys, you give me some thoughts
- Papa, for all the tales you spin,

1228
01:39:59,144 --> 01:40:03,695
you can't fix your own tale ?
- You've my scriptwriter's genes !

1229
01:40:03,982 --> 01:40:09,375
What a lead ! Now let me think

1230
01:40:10,422 --> 01:40:16,373
The pen, mightier than the evil
now gives a tough time to the devil

1231
01:40:16,962 --> 01:40:22,890
The villain's end is disaster,
the story is penned by the writer

1232
01:40:23,502 --> 01:40:25,891
By his mother !
- Papa !

1233
01:40:26,938 --> 01:40:28,895
I don't think I swore

1234
01:40:29,608 --> 01:40:33,897
low did this kind of a problem crop up
- Money isn't important, life is

1235
01:40:34,479 --> 01:40:37,062
Denied life, it's all a graveyard.
- But why must this happen ?

1236
01:40:37,516 --> 01:40:38,472
Why indeed

1237
01:40:45,390 --> 01:40:47,677
Obeisances, holy men.
- Saturn is inclement

1238
01:40:48,059 --> 01:40:54,351
negative forces are at work, tough time
in the making, a threat to his life

1239
01:40:54,733 --> 01:40:56,553
A life-threat !
- Nonsense

1240
01:41:06,678 --> 01:41:11,536
You see, the difference it'd make,
if the coconut fell two inches closer ?

1241
01:41:11,817 --> 01:41:14,866
Holy fathers !
- Be warned by me,

1242
01:41:15,487 --> 01:41:19,708
that was the third accident of the day.
Only God can save you from the fourth

1243
01:41:20,525 --> 01:41:22,482
And no escape?
What are you doing ?

1244
01:41:22,761 --> 01:41:24,377
Let's go

1245
01:41:24,930 --> 01:41:26,386
Stop child !

1246
01:41:26,631 --> 01:41:29,885
Do not avert your face from the gurus'
The gurus are omniscient

1247
01:41:30,936 --> 01:41:35,726
Oh ! I see the angel of death
look up there

1248
01:41:36,541 --> 01:41:41,126
What should I do ?
- To save your husband's life

1249
01:41:41,613 --> 01:41:45,663
you must make penance for 21 days.
Will you do it?

1250
01:41:45,917 --> 01:41:47,464
I shall

1251
01:41:51,456 --> 01:41:56,007
Child, you know what penance entails'
Abstinence, not only from food

1252
01:41:56,461 --> 01:42:02,514
total abstinence. Including husband.
Wear a Keep safe distance label

1253
01:42:04,402 --> 01:42:08,350
I shall do all you wish !
- Misha, I don't believe this

1254
01:42:08,907 --> 01:42:10,363
Do not touch !

1255
01:42:11,409 --> 01:42:13,366
Stay away

1256
01:42:13,979 --> 01:42:14,935
Masters!

1257
01:42:16,147 --> 01:42:17,103
Masters?

1258
01:42:17,916 --> 01:42:19,873
Don't touch !
- Misha, don't believe in all this

1259
01:42:20,085 --> 01:42:21,371
I said, no !
- Misha

1260
01:42:21,553 --> 01:42:22,702
Don't touch me !

1261
01:42:22,921 --> 01:42:24,377
Bless the gurus

1262
01:42:28,426 --> 01:42:34,377
Relax man, 21 days will pass.
Cut the crap and say why you called n

1263
01:42:35,534 --> 01:42:40,722
Boss wants to meet, to make sure you':
not frustrated and doing silly things

1264
01:42:41,106 --> 01:42:43,825
Where is he, call him.
- Right away

1265
01:42:45,810 --> 01:42:46,766
Mr Rae '2?

1266
01:42:51,917 --> 01:42:53,874
Mr Policeman ? Welcome

1267
01:42:55,453 --> 01:42:56,409
What gives ?

1268
01:42:57,455 --> 01:43:00,675
Call your boss.
Let's talk it out with him

1269
01:43:01,493 --> 01:43:06,351
Boss ? Who's boss ?
No one else's here but the two of us

1270
01:43:07,599 --> 01:43:08,555
Rae

1271
01:43:24,649 --> 01:43:26,697
How did you know
that behind the mirror

1272
01:43:27,619 --> 01:43:28,575
lam?

1273
01:43:28,954 --> 01:43:33,539
Mr Baldev Chopra, I've come to know,
you're behind whatever there is

1274
01:43:35,627 --> 01:43:38,050
Behind Rae's treachery, you are

1275
01:43:39,698 --> 01:43:42,383
Behind Sher Singh's ruination, you are

1276
01:43:44,636 --> 01:43:47,719
And behind the fake Shekhar's
masquerade, you are

1277
01:43:48,006 --> 01:43:48,962
Fake Shekhar ?

1278
01:43:54,679 --> 01:43:57,660
You are taking big chances,
do you know what you're saying ?

1279
01:43:57,983 --> 01:44:03,467
What little I know is enough
for sending you to jail for life

1280
01:44:05,490 --> 01:44:08,414
Do you remember the night?
It was your son Vicky

1281
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:10,917
who killed Nisha's father

1282
01:44:20,605 --> 01:44:23,927
Don't come near, I'll shoot

1283
01:44:25,944 --> 01:44:27,423
I'll shoot

1284
01:44:31,516 --> 01:44:33,473
Several people lost their lives

1285
01:44:34,052 --> 01:44:36,009
But Vicky escaped unhurt

1286
01:44:36,855 --> 01:44:41,611
'hen he got to you, a happy amazement
was shining in your unblinking eyes

1287
01:44:44,429 --> 01:44:46,045
You are alive ?

1288
01:44:46,431 --> 01:44:48,388
Thank God, you're alive

1289
01:44:48,967 --> 01:44:50,924
But Vicky's face was burnt

1290
01:44:51,569 --> 01:44:54,129
It was plastic surgeon Dr Modi,
who fixed it

1291
01:44:54,639 --> 01:44:58,394
Doctor, you've worked a miracle !
No one can tell, his face was burnt

1292
01:44:58,677 --> 01:45:00,395
No big deal, Mr Chopra

1293
01:45:00,845 --> 01:45:03,928
Science has progressed in rapid strides
If I wish, I can plant your face on his

1294
01:45:06,584 --> 01:45:09,064
Or his face on yours

1295
01:45:09,454 --> 01:45:11,070
Thank you, doctor

1296
01:45:12,023 --> 01:45:17,075
Vicky's face was fixed, not his fate.
To escape indictment for murder

1297
01:45:17,562 --> 01:45:20,577
Vicky found himself a prisoner,
confined in his own house

1298
01:45:21,866 --> 01:45:28,420
And Rae was telling you that Shekhar
had discovered the grand theft

1299
01:45:28,973 --> 01:45:34,764
Rao, you got two options. Either you
find the money, or you go to jail

1300
01:45:36,147 --> 01:45:39,765
No, I got a third option

1301
01:45:41,486 --> 01:45:43,534
I'll blackmail Shekhar.
- Blackmail ?

1302
01:45:43,922 --> 01:45:47,369
Yes, he has two wives

1303
01:45:48,059 --> 01:45:52,383
And he's been telling his two wives
that he's two different men

1304
01:45:53,131 --> 01:45:55,384
me Sher Singh ; and another, Shekha

1305
01:45:57,836 --> 01:46:01,557
You've shown me the way to a fortune

1306
01:46:06,111 --> 01:46:09,729
In a moment, a dangerous plot
was born in your mind

1307
01:46:11,950 --> 01:46:14,931
Your son Vicky underwent
plastic surgery, once again

1308
01:46:16,154 --> 01:46:21,411
You spin an interesting yarn, but
- I even have proof

1309
01:46:21,626 --> 01:46:22,582
Really ?

1310
01:46:23,128 --> 01:46:24,414
Inspector Naik

1311
01:46:32,670 --> 01:46:38,598
'he smartest of criminals get caught for
the silliest mistakes. Your mistake

1312
01:46:39,110 --> 01:46:44,696
as giving Dr Modi, a cheque of 500,00
and I wondered what this between

1313
01:46:45,049 --> 01:46:47,871
Shekhar and a plastic surgeon ?

1314
01:46:48,787 --> 01:46:53,873
I called Dr Modi in for routine enquiry,
the man was honest,

1315
01:46:54,826 --> 01:46:57,386
he rattled off the whole story

1316
01:46:58,463 --> 01:47:00,886
Mr Chopra, the story is over

1317
01:47:02,567 --> 01:47:06,891
Now get ready to spend
the rest of your lives in jail

1318
01:47:07,672 --> 01:47:08,924
Now, come on

1319
01:47:09,140 --> 01:47:11,723
What will you get
out of sending us to jail ?

1320
01:47:13,178 --> 01:47:15,738
Maybe you'll make it to page three
on some newspaper ?

1321
01:47:18,850 --> 01:47:24,505
I know, you are scrupulously honest
but honesty pays little

1322
01:47:25,824 --> 01:47:29,579
To live in a world of your dreams,
one must be a little dishonest, yes ?

1323
01:47:29,894 --> 01:47:32,408
Of course, to keep a secret a secret,

1324
01:47:32,730 --> 01:47:35,415
I'll pay you. 2.5 million

1325
01:47:38,469 --> 01:47:39,425
5 million ?

1326
01:47:40,638 --> 01:47:41,594
10 million !

1327
01:47:51,583 --> 01:47:53,039
Oh my God !

1328
01:48:01,960 --> 01:48:08,377
Oh such longing, such yearning
is mine, I miss you, my: love

1329
01:48:08,600 --> 01:48:13,390
.re you throwing the bread in my face
I say, give me some respect

1330
01:48:14,672 --> 01:48:15,628
Good

1331
01:48:17,876 --> 01:48:19,992
Why haven't you drunk your milk ?
- I don't want to

1332
01:48:20,445 --> 01:48:22,402
Like your father,
you want to drink my blood ?

1333
01:48:22,947 --> 01:48:24,733
Always no-this no-that !

1334
01:48:25,016 --> 01:48:27,064
Why are you beating the kid ?

1335
01:48:27,785 --> 01:48:32,404
Oh, am I to spoil him rotten, so he can
become a philanderer like his father ?

1336
01:48:33,458 --> 01:48:34,414
Behave yourself !

1337
01:48:34,893 --> 01:48:36,907
I've told you the circumstances
of that marriage

1338
01:48:37,729 --> 01:48:40,915
Oh, I'm like a drum, bearing the brunt
of emotional outbursts on either end

1339
01:48:41,666 --> 01:48:43,680
Oh, you wouldn't give it out,
until it got drummed out of you

1340
01:48:44,135 --> 01:48:48,083
If you hadn't evil on your mind,
you would've made a clean breast of it

1341
01:48:48,573 --> 01:48:52,521
I might have even forgiven you.
But no, you lived in sin for 7 years

1342
01:48:53,678 --> 01:48:58,366
Oh, those night-long story-sittings !
low I know what sittings were all about

1343
01:48:58,983 --> 01:49:02,374
Earning me about socializing with Nisha
it'll give our son a complex

1344
01:49:03,488 --> 01:49:05,911
Complex ! How could you say,
the story would out !

1345
01:49:06,591 --> 01:49:11,711
Phony conversations on the phone,
Ir Shekhar-how-are-you-and-what-not

1346
01:49:12,463 --> 01:49:17,048
You wouldn't give away the duplicity
and fool I was I never made you out !

1347
01:49:17,502 --> 01:49:20,392
Stop playing that record !
Will you let me eat, or not?

1348
01:49:20,571 --> 01:49:22,790
You're taking off
every time I reach for a morsel,

1349
01:49:23,942 --> 01:49:25,899
why did you serve food
if you want me to starve ?

1350
01:49:26,110 --> 01:49:28,067
Take the call

1351
01:49:29,213 --> 01:49:31,170
Sweaty, how are you my; child ?

1352
01:49:31,683 --> 01:49:32,639
Daddy!

1353
01:49:33,618 --> 01:49:35,541
Sweaty , what 'vs the matter '2?

1354
01:49:38,489 --> 01:49:41,072
What's wrong, baby ?
- Please, I beg you

1355
01:49:41,526 --> 01:49:42,812
I'm so happy

1356
01:49:42,994 --> 01:49:45,850
Who the hell is this ?
You've made my wife cry

1357
01:49:46,397 --> 01:49:48,354
Who the hell are you ?
- Son-in-law, it's me

1358
01:49:48,566 --> 01:49:53,549
Father-in-law ! H? respects !
- Never mind, whys is Sweet? crying ?

1359
01:49:53,838 --> 01:49:57,024
It's nothing, she's getting emotional,
saying what a cartoon her daddy is,

1360
01:49:57,408 --> 01:49:59,058
he doesn't even care
to contact her for months

1361
01:49:59,444 --> 01:50:01,401
Let me talk

1362
01:50:02,413 --> 01:50:06,532
Son, let me talk to Sweaty.
- She's gone hello, I can't hear

1363
01:50:07,552 --> 01:50:09,702
Speak up I can't hear.
- What's happening ?

1364
01:50:10,421 --> 01:50:12,378
Speak up.
- Why was Sweet? crying ?

1365
01:50:12,557 --> 01:50:14,446
Speak up.
 Any Problem ?

1366
01:50:14,625 --> 01:50:16,377
Louder
- Talk to me

1367
01:50:16,561 --> 01:50:18,518
Can't hear her voice
must be disconnected

1368
01:50:19,597 --> 01:50:23,716
I've lost my voice,
after all this screaming

1369
01:50:24,002 --> 01:50:27,893
If word outs about your fraud,
you've dug your grave

1370
01:50:28,439 --> 01:50:34,390
I'll dig a grave for the man
who's turned my life into a maze

1371
01:50:34,712 --> 01:50:40,401
But what's my look-alike looking for ?
- The wealth, what else ?

1372
01:50:40,585 --> 01:50:42,405
Wealth?
- He'll make that clear

1373
01:50:42,587 --> 01:50:47,673
Fool, if it wasn't for the wealth,
would he pose as Shekhar for Misha ?

1374
01:50:47,925 --> 01:50:50,348
He could've stayed
Sweety's Sher Singh

1375
01:50:50,895 --> 01:50:55,685
Oh, now I realise !
- Thank my stars, he does

1376
01:50:55,933 --> 01:50:58,857
That takes me to the bank

1377
01:51:01,139 --> 01:51:05,690
Sher Singh has changed his signature
Modi got his money, Rao got his,

1378
01:51:05,877 --> 01:51:10,701
you got yours and in time for my turn,
Sher Singh changed his signature ?

1379
01:51:11,015 --> 01:51:14,098
Pange, Sher Singh isn't the simpleton
you make him out to be

1380
01:51:14,585 --> 01:51:17,043
That's a scoundrel of as writer and
a fighter and he even threatened

1381
01:51:17,422 --> 01:51:19,880
to vivisect me.
- What was vivisect ?

1382
01:51:20,491 --> 01:51:24,712
Dissect me to pieces.
- Irrespective, if you betray me

1383
01:51:25,496 --> 01:51:27,715
I'll tear you to pieces.
- Hey Pange !

1384
01:51:27,932 --> 01:51:29,889
No messing with Pange

1385
01:51:33,538 --> 01:51:36,496
I must have my money in a week

1386
01:51:37,008 --> 01:51:38,965
You get me ? Else

1387
01:51:42,847 --> 01:51:44,997
Mr Pange
- Mr Pange listen

1388
01:51:45,450 --> 01:51:47,407
Oh my God, now what?

1389
01:51:49,654 --> 01:51:51,611
Nothing will happen

1390
01:51:51,923 --> 01:51:55,507
I'll steal the money
and Sher Singh will take the rap

1391
01:51:58,529 --> 01:52:03,353
Come inside a hundred woes always
come my way, you're welcome too

1392
01:52:03,935 --> 01:52:05,687
So who is it ?

1393
01:52:05,903 --> 01:52:08,019
Oh Mummy !
' My baby !

1394
01:52:08,473 --> 01:52:10,430
Son, look who's here

1395
01:52:11,142 --> 01:52:14,533
Father-in-law ! My deepest respects !
Mother-in-law ! My deepest respects !

1396
01:52:14,745 --> 01:52:16,361
How come you came without telling ?

1397
01:52:16,614 --> 01:52:20,710
'Are known men to marry: second wives
without telling anyone. Am I unwelcome

1398
01:52:25,089 --> 01:52:27,046
Water, please

1399
01:52:27,925 --> 01:52:29,381
What do you mean to say ?

1400
01:52:29,560 --> 01:52:33,884
If my daughter isn't happy,
your sister won't be happy either

1401
01:52:35,867 --> 01:52:41,556
You will forsake your second wife
or you can keep your sister at home

1402
01:52:42,173 --> 01:52:44,392
The wife won't let me eat,
her brother won't let me drink

1403
01:52:45,376 --> 01:52:47,333
Come on Sweaty.
- Where ?

1404
01:52:47,845 --> 01:52:48,994
Home

1405
01:52:50,148 --> 01:52:54,437
But this is home for me, would I forsake
my home to live with strangers ?

1406
01:52:57,555 --> 01:52:58,511
Strangers ?

1407
01:52:58,789 --> 01:53:02,839
In marriage, your daughter
is estranged, no ?

1408
01:53:03,895 --> 01:53:07,877
And you never sacrifice the joys of
your family for the woes of strangers

1409
01:53:13,471 --> 01:53:19,365
You'll forsake the one you were sworn
1 marriage forever, come joy or sorrow

1410
01:53:19,744 --> 01:53:21,030
What fault is hers ?

1411
01:53:21,412 --> 01:53:23,699
But my child
- Now she is your child

1412
01:53:24,615 --> 01:53:29,542
If anyone torments her,
it'll be the death of me

1413
01:53:43,834 --> 01:53:46,053
Let's go.
- How can you leave like this ?

1414
01:53:46,504 --> 01:53:49,587
At least you'll stay for tea ?
won't impose myself upon my daughter

1415
01:53:49,874 --> 01:53:53,458
Indirectly, you are refusing me
your hospitality ?

1416
01:53:53,711 --> 01:53:57,568
Understanding, I leave to the best
of your abilities. We are leaving

1417
01:53:58,549 --> 01:54:00,506
We'll see you off

1418
01:54:08,526 --> 01:54:09,482
Mother !

1419
01:54:17,602 --> 01:54:20,754
You're great, Sweet? !

1420
01:54:21,505 --> 01:54:25,601
You are no lady I mean,
you are a goddess

1421
01:54:26,077 --> 01:54:29,433
Despite all that happened, for whatever
you have done for my family,

1422
01:54:29,647 --> 01:54:33,094
you must be so big-hearted !
~ Not that big-hearted ! Don't touch me

1423
01:54:33,551 --> 01:54:38,443
I'm not hurting you, am I?
- Coming from you, one and the same

1424
01:54:38,623 --> 01:54:43,709
ls that so ?
You hurt if I even touch you ?

1425
01:54:44,028 --> 01:54:47,384
Then hit me Sweaty, hit me

1426
01:54:47,965 --> 01:54:54,382
After what you've done for my sister,
I'll suffer you without a whimper

1427
01:54:57,775 --> 01:55:00,893
Hurt me more Sweaty,
throw me out of this house

1428
01:55:01,178 --> 01:55:07,572
That's what you want, isn't it
so you can walk straight into her arms

1429
01:55:08,185 --> 01:55:12,076
God ! What've I gotten myself into ?
What am I to do with this man ?

1430
01:55:12,890 --> 01:55:16,474
If I was human, you'd do whatever

1431
01:55:16,694 --> 01:55:19,743
I'm becoming like a drum,
for taking it on my nether ends

1432
01:55:20,531 --> 01:55:23,421
Soon, the transmogrification
will be complete. I am drum

1433
01:55:29,073 --> 01:55:30,427
Boy, you are crying ?

1434
01:55:32,643 --> 01:55:36,762
For my papa's troubles,
he has turned into a drum

1435
01:55:36,981 --> 01:55:37,937
Drum ?

1436
01:55:38,482 --> 01:55:44,433
My mummy won't talk to him.
And my stepmother won't let him talk

1437
01:55:44,655 --> 01:55:49,877
This fake papa has put my papa
into a lot of tensions

1438
01:55:50,161 --> 01:55:53,381
What am I to do, Oh what do I do ?

1439
01:55:57,768 --> 01:55:59,054
Tell me something
- Yes please?

1440
01:55:59,437 --> 01:56:01,485
That's for me.
- Attitude

1441
01:56:01,706 --> 01:56:03,891
If the documents are so important,
Why are you putting them in my safe 1

1442
01:56:04,141 --> 01:56:06,394
Let's go in, I'll tell you.
Son, you stay here

1443
01:56:10,047 --> 01:56:13,494
I go to do it because of Sher Singh.
'here's no knowing how much he know

1444
01:56:13,951 --> 01:56:17,398
He might whack important papers.
- How right, I never thought of it

1445
01:56:20,524 --> 01:56:22,572
I suspect Sher Singh is right outside.
The bag is right behind you

1446
01:56:33,537 --> 01:56:36,586
The property papers are in the safe ?
- Yes

1447
01:56:37,108 --> 01:56:40,590
And the jewellery is in the bag ?
- What need for the jewellery ?

1448
01:56:40,811 --> 01:56:42,927
If you keep the jewellery,
what will my wife wear ?

1449
01:56:43,981 --> 01:56:47,702
Sure you don't know me ?
Shekhar, alias Sher Singh

1450
01:56:49,019 --> 01:56:50,874
Sher Singh?
- Yes

1451
01:56:51,055 --> 01:56:53,376
No !
- Yes

1452
01:56:59,463 --> 01:57:01,545
Yes ! Daylight robbery !

1453
01:57:23,988 --> 01:57:28,812
Nisha, Sher Singh also knocked me out
like this

1454
01:57:34,198 --> 01:57:38,590
Papa ! Run away from here !
- What happened ?

1455
01:57:39,203 --> 01:57:43,094
Duplicate papa pretended to be you
and he stole all Mummy's jewellery

1456
01:57:43,474 --> 01:57:44,930
The police is looking for you

1457
01:57:48,112 --> 01:57:49,068
Wait here

1458
01:57:49,480 --> 01:57:50,697
Oh sweet angels !

1459
01:57:50,915 --> 01:57:56,103
Are you running from the law ?
- Hot running away, running to the lam

1460
01:57:56,554 --> 01:57:59,979
And thanks to my lucky streak,
I've got bailors with me

1461
01:58:00,424 --> 01:58:04,372
Meet Mr Chellaramani.
- All my money for your bail?

1462
01:58:04,595 --> 01:58:08,384
Get me, this is the last time
I'm letting you off on bail

1463
01:58:08,599 --> 01:58:16,051
he next time, I won't need you because
once I'm done with the impostor

1464
01:58:16,540 --> 01:58:20,590
his ears will be shaken
and his heart will hear no more

1465
01:58:20,845 --> 01:58:24,395
You mean, his ears will hear no more,
his heart will be shaken

1466
01:58:24,582 --> 01:58:26,402
Something like that

1467
01:58:26,650 --> 01:58:30,473
What would you do to do that ?
- Something to make his Soul wonder

1468
01:58:30,754 --> 01:58:34,406
And his mind will tremble.
- The mind will wonder and

1469
01:58:34,625 --> 01:58:37,481
Soul will tremble.
- Something like that

1470
01:58:37,695 --> 01:58:40,084
What would you do to do that ?
- That which I'll do to you

1471
01:58:40,464 --> 01:58:42,080
when I find out.
- What !

1472
01:58:42,466 --> 01:58:44,753
Meaning, you'll know when he does it.
- What will you do ?

1473
01:58:44,969 --> 01:58:49,952
You're screaming like my opponent's
lackey would. I haven't decided,

1474
01:58:50,407 --> 01:58:54,355
how can I tell you what I'll do ?
But one thing's for sure

1475
01:58:55,145 --> 01:58:57,705
I'll do something for sure

1476
01:58:58,115 --> 01:59:00,868
What's this something ?
- Something can be anything

1477
01:59:01,418 --> 01:59:03,568
You should've found out
what he's thinking

1478
01:59:03,821 --> 01:59:05,710
I asked and he said,
he hasn't thought of anything

1479
01:59:05,923 --> 01:59:09,439
So until he thinks of doing something,
we keep thinking fearfully

1480
01:59:09,693 --> 01:59:12,481
of what he might be thinking.
- With fear in our hearts

1481
01:59:12,963 --> 01:59:16,547
Why didn't you do something about him
- You could've done so much to him

1482
01:59:16,634 --> 01:59:21,390
like putting him away for four months
- Like I rule the roost?

1483
01:59:22,006 --> 01:59:25,829
;mall-time crime doesn't count. He'll b'
out on bail. It takes big-time crime

1484
01:59:25,910 --> 01:59:30,393
Murder frame him for murder!
- Then I can even fake an encounter

1485
01:59:30,648 --> 01:59:34,403
somethings got to be done ! Then Nisha
ends up with Vicky and we get the mom

1486
01:59:35,786 --> 01:59:38,869
Vicky? That means, he is

1487
01:59:39,924 --> 01:59:43,849
hope he won't end up killing you when
you're pulling off the fake encounter

1488
01:59:44,929 --> 01:59:46,681
That too, might happen ?
- Anything might happen

1489
01:59:51,402 --> 01:59:53,086
What happened ?
- I just don't trust that guy

1490
01:59:53,470 --> 01:59:55,518
I think someone was over there.
- Who?

1491
01:59:57,408 --> 01:59:59,092
Yes who is this ?

1492
01:59:59,577 --> 02:00:00,692
I'm Maggie

1493
02:00:01,478 --> 02:00:03,435
And I'm the noodle. Go on
- What?

1494
02:00:03,647 --> 02:00:10,371
I mean, just go on.
- I've found out who the look-alike is

1495
02:00:10,754 --> 02:00:12,040
I know who's behind the whole plot

1496
02:00:13,958 --> 02:00:16,040
Whose plot is it, Maggie say it !

1497
02:00:16,627 --> 02:00:23,385
I can't say over the phone. I fear for
my life. I think they're after me

1498
02:00:23,667 --> 02:00:29,117
Please see me at Victoria Fountain.
- A bath, a change and I'll dash for it

1499
02:00:29,573 --> 02:00:33,464
Just come over, never mind the change
- In a minute, just you wait

1500
02:00:45,889 --> 02:00:46,845
Stop here

1501
02:00:51,128 --> 02:00:53,017
No change, sir.
- It's okay

1502
02:00:53,397 --> 02:00:54,353
Thanks

1503
02:00:54,531 --> 02:00:57,683
Maggie she made a noodle out of me

1504
02:01:04,575 --> 02:01:08,364
Now tell me, who are these guys
after me, what do you know ?

1505
02:01:09,446 --> 02:01:14,373
Maggie, I'm talking to you
and you're staring like a zombie ?

1506
02:01:14,618 --> 02:01:19,374
Maggie, don't you understand,
I need to know who's after me

1507
02:01:20,491 --> 02:01:22,880
Maggie what's the matter with you E

1508
02:01:31,135 --> 02:01:33,092
They did it to her!
I hope I don't get framed for it

1509
02:01:37,441 --> 02:01:38,397
Run

1510
02:01:42,846 --> 02:01:43,733
Auto rickshaw

1511
02:01:51,955 --> 02:01:55,846
Nothing could be a worse piece
of evidence ! Where's my loincloth ?

1512
02:02:02,099 --> 02:02:03,351
Anything found ?

1513
02:02:03,901 --> 02:02:05,357
A loincloth

1514
02:02:07,137 --> 02:02:08,354
A loincloth ?

1515
02:02:08,906 --> 02:02:10,863
But this is Sher Singh's loincloth

1516
02:02:12,409 --> 02:02:14,366
This means,
Sher Singh committed the murder

1517
02:02:19,149 --> 02:02:21,106
Sher Singh Sher Singh

1518
02:02:21,552 --> 02:02:23,566
Stop !
- The cops are looking for you

1519
02:02:23,987 --> 02:02:25,944
And you're walking around
like a free bird ?

1520
02:02:26,023 --> 02:02:30,039
But no need to fear. We've such a piece:
of evidence against that fake Shekhar;

1521
02:02:30,494 --> 02:02:34,886
not even the police can save him !
- These fools think, I am Sher Singh

1522
02:02:36,900 --> 02:02:38,880
But where is the evidence ?
- Not here

1523
02:02:39,436 --> 02:02:43,384
Then where ?
- Where no one has ever been

1524
02:02:44,108 --> 02:02:45,064
Look

1525
02:02:57,121 --> 02:02:59,738
So this is the proof
you were cheating me

1526
02:02:59,990 --> 02:03:01,947
It's called cheating the cheater

1527
02:03:02,126 --> 02:03:04,345
Undress
- Undress, why ?

1528
02:03:04,561 --> 02:03:08,509
Unless you undress, how to make him
Shekhar and you a Sher Singh ?

1529
02:03:08,899 --> 02:03:13,348
And unless you are Sher Singh,
how can the police go for you ?

1530
02:03:18,408 --> 02:03:20,365
I'll make sure you cops are transferred

1531
02:03:20,544 --> 02:03:22,899
Sher Singh, stop

1532
02:03:34,958 --> 02:03:38,542
You what are you doing here ?
- Where else should I be ?

1533
02:03:39,530 --> 02:03:42,454
Not at your papa's birthday party ?
- ls his dad as much of a scoundrel ?

1534
02:03:42,666 --> 02:03:47,388
What are you wondering ?
- How I forgot my papa's birthday

1535
02:03:47,604 --> 02:03:49,390
That's why I tell you
not to drink so much

1536
02:03:49,573 --> 02:03:52,554
Get to the party.
- Party ? You aren't coming ?

1537
02:03:53,443 --> 02:03:56,060
Forgot again ? The private airplane
is being delivered today

1538
02:03:56,513 --> 02:03:59,403
We bought it with Nisha's money.
- With my wife's money ?

1539
02:04:00,017 --> 02:04:07,913
Your girl won't let you touch her,
take her up in the plane, have fun

1540
02:04:11,461 --> 02:04:12,417
What happened ?

1541
02:04:12,629 --> 02:04:14,586
Wonderful idea.
Why didn't you say it before ?

1542
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,753
I know, you must've a bank of ideas.
- Oh sure

1543
02:04:20,137 --> 02:04:22,595
Let's talk all about it in the car.
Let's go party

1544
02:04:39,523 --> 02:04:40,479
Vicky's dad?

1545
02:04:41,525 --> 02:04:46,508
Many happy returns of the day.
- Let's have a wonderful evening

1546
02:04:48,599 --> 02:04:49,555
Son

1547
02:04:51,134 --> 02:04:53,557
why are you standing so far ?
Won't you give your daddy a hug ?

1548
02:04:59,209 --> 02:05:01,564
God bless you, son.
- Thank you, Daddy

1549
02:05:02,546 --> 02:05:05,902
Rao, I gave you a job to do,
what are you doing here ?

1550
02:05:06,550 --> 02:05:09,406
I was on my way there,
Vicky forced me to come here

1551
02:05:10,454 --> 02:05:14,880
So Rao works for Chopra, also for Vicky
and he's the mole

1552
02:05:15,225 --> 02:05:16,181
Mr Chopra

1553
02:05:19,229 --> 02:05:21,186
Doctor and Rao

1554
02:05:22,499 --> 02:05:23,955
And Chopra, in league

1555
02:05:24,167 --> 02:05:27,421
Shekhar, how are you ?
- Okay

1556
02:05:28,472 --> 02:05:29,758
Okay ?
- Absolutely fine

1557
02:05:29,973 --> 02:05:31,623
Let me take a look

1558
02:05:31,842 --> 02:05:34,425
Yes, perfectly fine.
- Sure it is

1559
02:05:34,645 --> 02:05:37,933
Like I told you, as long as you take
the pills, you'll be fine

1560
02:05:38,815 --> 02:05:41,773
What pills
- In plastic surgery, it happens

1561
02:05:42,719 --> 02:05:45,541
Replacing one face with another
is no easy undertaking

1562
02:05:47,057 --> 02:05:52,712
I hope the irritation isn't persisting ?
- In time, every itch will go away

1563
02:06:31,969 --> 02:06:35,155
If you're in love,
let it rip

1564
02:06:35,639 --> 02:06:38,427
If you're dying for someone,
let it rip

1565
02:06:46,016 --> 02:06:52,376
If you're silent, your heart will rip
in Iowa's grip

1566
02:07:52,983 --> 02:07:56,374
Those heartfelt passions,
don't keep unsated

1567
02:07:56,620 --> 02:07:59,874
Don't wait till time
and seasons have fled

1568
02:08:00,590 --> 02:08:03,708
Listen my lovely,
don't drive me crazy

1569
02:08:03,927 --> 02:08:06,885
in tosses of your tresses

1570
02:08:41,064 --> 02:08:44,853
Till gone, the glint in your eyes
and dreams have faded, waiting

1571
02:08:47,938 --> 02:08:51,522
in silence, your chance is losing

1572
02:09:02,586 --> 02:09:05,772
In pursuits of amour,
games of the heart

1573
02:09:05,989 --> 02:09:08,708
lives in wandering, are lost

1574
02:09:09,659 --> 02:09:12,378
If you're in love,
let it rip

1575
02:09:13,096 --> 02:09:15,849
If you're dying for someone,
let it rip

1576
02:09:16,633 --> 02:09:22,891
If in silence, let my heart rip
in loves grip

1577
02:09:39,723 --> 02:09:41,908
That happens yes Vicky ?

1578
02:09:43,026 --> 02:09:45,347
What are you trying to do
dressed like Sher Singh ?

1579
02:09:46,463 --> 02:09:49,512
I was forced to dress like this !
And I'm not trying anything

1580
02:09:49,766 --> 02:09:53,350
except to escape from the police.
- What rot ! Even last night

1581
02:09:53,570 --> 02:09:55,686
you were partying with us.
- It wasn't me, it was Sher Singh

1582
02:09:55,939 --> 02:09:58,419
What !
- Last night, I partied with death

1583
02:09:58,808 --> 02:10:02,358
What do you mean to say ?
- Sher Singh's Johnnies led me to him

1584
02:10:02,612 --> 02:10:04,364
hen they made a Sher Singh out of me
set the cops after me and

1585
02:10:04,648 --> 02:10:07,367
rent to partying pretending to be Vicky
- Oh my God

1586
02:10:08,118 --> 02:10:11,873
I Dad what's Sher Singh doing here

1587
02:10:12,122 --> 02:10:15,877
Shut up ! I'm not Sher Singh !
- Then whatever are you ?

1588
02:10:16,860 --> 02:10:21,878
Dad, I'm your Vicky, your son.
- You're the son, I'm not?

1589
02:10:22,766 --> 02:10:28,717
You expect them to believe you ?
You take them for outright morons ?

1590
02:10:30,106 --> 02:10:32,393
Now, Pange's going to get you

1591
02:10:35,612 --> 02:10:37,569
No need to use the phone

1592
02:10:38,949 --> 02:10:40,906
Pange has arrived and heard

1593
02:10:41,218 --> 02:10:44,540
He says he is Vicky.
Even you say, you are

1594
02:10:45,522 --> 02:10:47,502
Go on, prove you're saying the truth

1595
02:10:47,924 --> 02:10:50,404
Yes, the truth will out in two minutes

1596
02:10:51,795 --> 02:10:54,355
What proof have you ?
- Daddy, what proof do you want?

1597
02:10:54,864 --> 02:10:58,448
About the time when
nu caught me smoking when I was kid

1598
02:11:00,570 --> 02:11:03,892
Or do you wish to see the revolver
I used to kill Nisha's daddy ?

1599
02:11:06,543 --> 02:11:11,367
Ow about the passport that Mr Rao stole
for me from Shekhar's residence ?

1600
02:11:11,781 --> 02:11:15,365
Dad, he's using our bag of tricks upon
us. Last night when you were drunk

1601
02:11:15,619 --> 02:11:18,042
he must've gotten it out of you
and now he's trying to be clever

1602
02:11:18,989 --> 02:11:22,380
Mr Rao I'm Vicky man, come on !

1603
02:11:23,193 --> 02:11:31,590
Head to toe, from shirt to loincloth
you've got Sher Singh screaming out

1604
02:11:32,002 --> 02:11:38,453
Hold it ! If you are Vicky, then say,
where is the video which Mr Rao filmed

1605
02:11:38,775 --> 02:11:41,494
The video I studied to become Shekhai
where is it ?

1606
02:11:43,480 --> 02:11:48,532
Inside my locker at the health-club.
Next, the locker number ? It's 111

1607
02:11:50,954 --> 02:11:55,505
This creep has gotten into my skin,
get rid of him, Mr Rao, get rid of him

1608
02:11:57,927 --> 02:12:02,854
Reminds you ? It's Sher Singh-speak

1609
02:12:05,435 --> 02:12:07,688
low watch me take the truth out of him

1610
02:12:08,538 --> 02:12:09,494
Well

1611
02:12:10,073 --> 02:12:13,896
if you are Vicky for real then,
what did Sher Singh say exactly

1612
02:12:14,077 --> 02:12:16,557
when you quizzed him
about his company's turnover

1613
02:12:17,881 --> 02:12:24,867
I don't care, I'm a fun-loving Punjabi,
I eat, drink and make merry

1614
02:12:27,190 --> 02:12:29,147
Proved. Who was the Punjabi ?

1615
02:12:31,761 --> 02:12:32,717
Sher Singh

1616
02:12:32,896 --> 02:12:34,375
Who ate and drank and made merry ?

1617
02:12:34,931 --> 02:12:35,887
Sher Singh

1618
02:12:36,633 --> 02:12:38,590
That's Sher Singh for you

1619
02:12:42,672 --> 02:12:45,323
Dad Mr Rao what are you up to ?
- Do you take us for fools ?

1620
02:12:45,909 --> 02:12:48,059
No ones falling for you.
You are Sher Singh

1621
02:12:48,545 --> 02:12:49,660
And he is Vicky. Proved

1622
02:12:49,913 --> 02:12:51,392
Daddy, come to your senses
or I'll beat you into it

1623
02:12:51,581 --> 02:12:55,506
You talk of beating your daddy ?
He can never be my son. Take him out

1624
02:13:15,872 --> 02:13:17,829
Beauties, both

1625
02:13:19,476 --> 02:13:21,433
Two together could drive a man crazy

1626
02:13:23,546 --> 02:13:26,026
You you're back home ?

1627
02:13:26,416 --> 02:13:27,372
Indeed

1628
02:13:27,550 --> 02:13:31,532
Come, let me give you
a proper welcome

1629
02:13:33,156 --> 02:13:36,877
No need, cut it out and make tea for m

1630
02:13:37,560 --> 02:13:43,715
Sure, first I'll tell your mother
her brave son has returned

1631
02:13:45,935 --> 02:13:49,382
She is cynical or is she ?

1632
02:13:50,774 --> 02:13:52,560
But it's time to telephone that bastard

1633
02:13:54,577 --> 02:13:56,534
Might be Pange

1634
02:13:58,481 --> 02:13:59,437
Sher Singh

1635
02:14:00,617 --> 02:14:03,575
Not Pange. Someone else

1636
02:14:04,454 --> 02:14:05,410
Who is that ?

1637
02:14:05,755 --> 02:14:06,711
Vicky speaking

1638
02:14:07,524 --> 02:14:09,481
You're still speaking ? Speak

1639
02:14:09,793 --> 02:14:11,409
Guess where I'm speaking from ?

1640
02:14:11,895 --> 02:14:13,750
You use an orifice other than
a mouth to speak ?

1641
02:14:14,531 --> 02:14:16,488
I'm speaking from your house

1642
02:14:18,468 --> 02:14:20,425
Where I fall silent,
you begin to speak ?

1643
02:14:21,070 --> 02:14:24,756
It's not only about speaking,
it's also about seeing

1644
02:14:25,008 --> 02:14:26,430
before my eyes, your pretty wife

1645
02:14:29,479 --> 02:14:33,632
[u tricked the other woman into penance
but this one, I'm not going to spare

1646
02:14:34,017 --> 02:14:38,966
Silly, you got yourself a wrong number
And you're in for lots of disturbance

1647
02:14:40,623 --> 02:14:43,103
Sher Singh! Completely unabashed

1648
02:14:44,160 --> 02:14:48,381
And that disturbance, from a woman ?
Must check her out

1649
02:14:48,932 --> 02:14:50,889
Sweaty
- What is it ?

1650
02:14:54,437 --> 02:14:58,385
Come to the bedroom, we got to talk.
- With you in the bedroom ? Never

1651
02:14:58,775 --> 02:15:02,894
Come quietly, or I'll force my will.
- You'll force your will?

1652
02:15:05,014 --> 02:15:06,971
Oh no !
- Mother-in-law !

1653
02:15:07,217 --> 02:15:08,969
He means rape !

1654
02:15:09,452 --> 02:15:12,069
No Mother ! I never meant that.
- How shameless !

1655
02:15:12,555 --> 02:15:14,512
You rape me ?

1656
02:15:17,460 --> 02:15:19,417
Get out !
- Oh no !

1657
02:15:20,663 --> 02:15:22,620
Oh these women !

1658
02:15:22,832 --> 02:15:23,788
Ran

1659
02:15:25,568 --> 02:15:29,755
mother-in-law did he run away
to the other woman ?

1660
02:15:30,740 --> 02:15:31,696
Wait

1661
02:15:37,647 --> 02:15:39,763
Are you blind ?
- What rot !

1662
02:15:39,983 --> 02:15:41,439
What !
- You bumped into me

1663
02:15:41,618 --> 02:15:44,701
I did ? You rascal !
Weren't you whistling at me ?

1664
02:15:47,090 --> 02:15:50,048
You want to mess with Pange ?
I never whistled, when did I ?

1665
02:15:50,593 --> 02:15:52,550
You didn't ! Then go whistling now

1666
02:15:54,097 --> 02:15:56,714
I'm a policeman.
Never mess with policemen

1667
02:15:57,066 --> 02:15:59,387
But policemen can mess with girls ?

1668
02:16:00,003 --> 02:16:00,788
Strange ! When did I mess ?

1669
02:16:02,005 --> 02:16:03,154
You mean, we're messing with you ?

1670
02:16:03,540 --> 02:16:05,725
When did I?
- Bash him up

1671
02:16:09,078 --> 02:16:11,399
What's going on ? Stop

1672
02:16:12,515 --> 02:16:13,471
Stand aside

1673
02:16:15,084 --> 02:16:17,906
Sir, it's her doing

1674
02:16:18,488 --> 02:16:21,412
No, it's her doing Oh no !
They're all in it together

1675
02:16:21,591 --> 02:16:23,980
He's lying !
- He slammed into me

1676
02:16:24,193 --> 02:16:26,878
Then I asked why are you teasing us,
he said, you're good for teasing only

1677
02:16:27,597 --> 02:16:31,079
What a loafer, he even whistled at me.
- I warned him, I'd call my husband

1678
02:16:31,534 --> 02:16:34,424
e says, I'm here. You need a husband
- And you know what he did to me ?

1679
02:16:37,974 --> 02:16:38,930
Silence

1680
02:16:39,676 --> 02:16:43,431
Mr Pange, you've brought the
police department to shame. You're fire

1681
02:16:47,584 --> 02:16:49,541
Sher Singh, what are you up to ?

1682
02:16:53,089 --> 02:16:57,105
I needed the money, that's why.
Try to understand me

1683
02:16:58,127 --> 02:17:00,550
What are you up to ?
- The door won't give

1684
02:17:04,500 --> 02:17:06,457
Imagine what'll happen
if I break the steering wheel

1685
02:17:07,437 --> 02:17:09,724
An accident.
- Correct

1686
02:17:10,673 --> 02:17:11,629
Here you go

1687
02:17:15,445 --> 02:17:18,403
Sher Singh, you're being foolish,
you'll kill is both

1688
02:17:18,615 --> 02:17:20,572
Not us. You alone

1689
02:17:28,558 --> 02:17:29,514
Bye-bye

1690
02:17:36,666 --> 02:17:38,623
Sher Singh ! Save my life !

1691
02:17:54,150 --> 02:17:58,371
The wife I love less will die ?
What are you saying ?

1692
02:17:58,821 --> 02:18:02,371
Nothing except fate's writ

1693
02:18:04,160 --> 02:18:06,447
What a terrible writ

1694
02:18:06,829 --> 02:18:10,379
Worse, isn't clear. Which wife does
he love less, which one is to die ?

1695
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:18,726
N time, comes answer to all questions
- I need answers, I've two little sons

1696
02:18:19,442 --> 02:18:25,734
They need their mothers. Please pray,
let this crisis blows away

1697
02:18:27,550 --> 02:18:30,531
He has turned the tables upon us

1698
02:18:30,987 --> 02:18:35,413
Yes, paid us back in our coin

1699
02:18:35,792 --> 02:18:40,411
Daddy, you're the world's first father
who tattooed on his son's arm,

1700
02:18:40,596 --> 02:18:42,553
his worst enemy's name

1701
02:18:42,865 --> 02:18:46,517
I only got it tattooed with an SS.
Where did you get the NH ?

1702
02:18:46,936 --> 02:18:50,452
I got it done to say,
Sher Singh, I'm not

1703
02:18:52,809 --> 02:18:55,858
Thanks be, we're alive.
What must've happened to Mr Rao ?

1704
02:18:56,446 --> 02:18:58,835
I've my doubts he's alive

1705
02:18:59,148 --> 02:19:01,537
I'd much rather be dead

1706
02:19:03,886 --> 02:19:04,842
Mr Rao !

1707
02:19:09,859 --> 02:19:13,045
Mr Rao, what've you done to yourself,
have you taken the wrong pills ?

1708
02:19:13,496 --> 02:19:16,545
No !
- How did this happen to you ?

1709
02:19:17,467 --> 02:19:22,394
Sher Singh threw me into a jungle.
- Into a jungle ?

1710
02:19:23,439 --> 02:19:26,557
1 you know what happened to me then
- What happened ?

1711
02:19:27,610 --> 02:19:30,466
I can't begin to re-live it !
- Mr Rao, you must tell us

1712
02:19:31,180 --> 02:19:33,137
No
- Whisper it in my ears

1713
02:19:33,449 --> 02:19:35,406
Say it.
- In my ears

1714
02:19:41,124 --> 02:19:45,345
What rot ! A bear in the forest ?
It went to that extent ?

1715
02:19:46,462 --> 02:19:47,418
Bloody bear !

1716
02:19:57,073 --> 02:19:59,030
Vicky my son

1717
02:20:00,009 --> 02:20:01,033
It's me

1718
02:20:01,811 --> 02:20:04,564
Dad, what've you been up to ?
I've been looking for you for 4 days

1719
02:20:05,014 --> 02:20:08,370
While you were looking for me,
I was looking for Sher Singh

1720
02:20:08,551 --> 02:20:11,373
I'm Vicky ! Sher Singh, I'm not!

1721
02:20:11,788 --> 02:20:13,745
Hit him you hear ?

1722
02:20:14,590 --> 02:20:16,706
Listen to him, he was hard to find

1723
02:20:17,627 --> 02:20:22,383
Get to the mansion in Panvel,
we're waiting for you

1724
02:20:23,199 --> 02:20:27,454
Enough of this cat and mouse game,
we'll put an end to it today

1725
02:20:32,208 --> 02:20:36,725
Why only the game,
it's endgame for you too, bloody dad

1726
02:20:45,788 --> 02:20:46,744
You !
What are you doing here ?

1727
02:20:49,592 --> 02:20:55,349
I only came to tell you
that our husband has landed in a trap

1728
02:20:56,966 --> 02:21:02,860
But you don't worry, as long as
lam alive, he can come to no harm

1729
02:21:05,174 --> 02:21:06,130
Also,

1730
02:21:07,143 --> 02:21:10,499
Tuk-tuk has no one but me
in this whole wide world

1731
02:21:11,447 --> 02:21:15,543
If something happens to me,
please take care of my son

1732
02:21:17,019 --> 02:21:19,533
Daughter-in-law wait, listen

1733
02:21:42,778 --> 02:21:43,665
Welcome, son

1734
02:21:44,380 --> 02:21:46,769
Daddy, where is Shekhar ?

1735
02:21:47,450 --> 02:21:49,407
Shekhar ? Shekhar, you are

1736
02:21:49,986 --> 02:21:51,670
I mean, where is Sher Singh ?

1737
02:21:52,121 --> 02:21:53,077
Sher Singh ?

1738
02:21:55,524 --> 02:21:58,846
Pange, show him Sher Singh

1739
02:22:27,089 --> 02:22:28,375
Sher Singh, I'm not

1740
02:22:28,557 --> 02:22:32,039
So what do I mean to say if I mean to
ay, I'm not Sher Singh. Means, you are'

1741
02:22:34,497 --> 02:22:39,719
Jr whatever he did to you, you can take
revenge and count the bones you break

1742
02:22:43,039 --> 02:22:44,928
What are you doing ?

1743
02:22:50,846 --> 02:22:52,496
Hit the bastard, smash him

1744
02:23:08,464 --> 02:23:09,420
Over here

1745
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:11,922
That's it

1746
02:23:21,644 --> 02:23:23,362
Freeze

1747
02:23:23,546 --> 02:23:25,025
Now move, over

1748
02:23:26,949 --> 02:23:31,534
I take your life or I let you live !
Do you think you deserve it?

1749
02:23:32,455 --> 02:23:33,411
Stop it

1750
02:23:38,427 --> 02:23:41,385
Misha. . . Sweaty

1751
02:23:41,931 --> 02:23:46,380
You'll do nothing of the sort, Vicky.
Or, I'll pump all six into your brains

1752
02:23:46,769 --> 02:23:51,127
If you're alive afterwards,
I'll vivisect you

1753
02:23:51,607 --> 02:23:56,966
Silly ladies, I'm hero. He's villain.
I mean, I am the Sher Singh

1754
02:23:57,213 --> 02:23:59,932
And he is he is that Vicky.
Hey, why don't you tell them ?

1755
02:24:00,616 --> 02:24:06,544
Like what ? O'dearest wives, will you
stare at it or do it? Kill the creep

1756
02:24:06,956 --> 02:24:11,746
You'll make widows of yourselves, he's
a conman, saying all that for effect

1757
02:24:13,195 --> 02:24:17,587
Don't you dare do anything to my son
If anything happens to my Vicky,

1758
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:19,616
no name's getting out alive

1759
02:24:19,902 --> 02:24:21,415
No ones walking out alive

1760
02:24:21,871 --> 02:24:25,421
He's a conman and that's his daddy,
saying his enemy is his son

1761
02:24:25,674 --> 02:24:29,770
he's confusing everyone, don't listen
to him. Listen to me pay attention

1762
02:24:30,546 --> 02:24:32,435
You think he is your husband ?
- Yes

1763
02:24:32,681 --> 02:24:34,831
50, at least allow me to shoot that guy

1764
02:24:35,217 --> 02:24:38,107
Now, I'm undone we've lost it

1765
02:24:38,687 --> 02:24:40,507
Get up, son.
- Rise and shine

1766
02:24:46,495 --> 02:24:47,781
Did that hurt, Shekhar ?

1767
02:24:47,963 --> 02:24:51,388
How you recognise me ? Finally you do
Until husbands are broken men,

1768
02:24:51,567 --> 02:24:54,047
wives seldom realise !
Why did you women come here ?

1769
02:24:54,437 --> 02:24:56,121
For your life !
- To save you

1770
02:24:56,505 --> 02:24:58,860
To save me, or to trap me ?
Who told you to come here ?

1771
02:24:59,041 --> 02:25:00,463
She
- She did.

1772
02:25:00,643 --> 02:25:04,398
She's the root cause of all trouble.
- You stupid bloody village girl

1773
02:25:13,556 --> 02:25:15,069
Stop this screaming match !
Dad, shoot everybody. Except Nisha

1774
02:25:18,694 --> 02:25:20,583
Emotional for Nisha ?

1775
02:25:23,232 --> 02:25:24,415
Now what ?

1776
02:25:26,469 --> 02:25:28,085
What's happening ?
- This country is saved !

1777
02:25:28,504 --> 02:25:29,585
Cops in time !

1778
02:25:40,149 --> 02:25:41,469
Tu k-tuk !
- Tony

1779
02:25:41,650 --> 02:25:42,606
Tu k-tuk-Tony

1780
02:25:44,653 --> 02:25:46,371
Catch them !
- Go

1781
02:25:49,158 --> 02:25:50,842
Them !

1782
02:26:06,108 --> 02:26:07,655
Tony run.
- You too, Tuk-tuk

1783
02:26:07,843 --> 02:26:08,799
Go

1784
02:26:15,084 --> 02:26:16,040
Drop it

1785
02:27:21,483 --> 02:27:23,440
Nisha, I love you Nisha

1786
02:27:27,856 --> 02:27:29,813
I love you too

1787
02:28:00,122 --> 02:28:01,078
Ho.

1788
02:29:51,567 --> 02:29:55,356
The wife lesser loved, will die

1789
02:30:18,827 --> 02:30:19,783
Papa

1790
02:30:21,130 --> 02:30:25,715
Papa, will my mummy live ?
- Yes son

1791
02:30:27,035 --> 02:30:32,587
pa, nothing will happen to my mummy
- Nothing will happen to her, son

1792
02:30:33,575 --> 02:30:36,533
Congratulations. Both are saved

1793
02:30:37,179 --> 02:30:41,798
What rot ! How could both be saved ?
Both are alive, but how could it be ?

1794
02:30:42,050 --> 02:30:45,532
How strange ! Both your wives survive:
and you aren't glad ?

1795
02:30:45,788 --> 02:30:48,439
No, of course I'm glad.
But how come both are alive ?

1796
02:30:49,124 --> 02:30:51,081
By our Guru's grace,
everything can happen

1797
