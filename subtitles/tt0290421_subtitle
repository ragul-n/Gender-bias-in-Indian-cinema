1
00:00:32,262 --> 00:00:36,790
"There will be no sorrows anymore..."

2
00:00:37,351 --> 00:00:42,466
"...in the whole of India."

3
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,873
"All the travelers
are on a long voyage."

4
00:00:48,743 --> 00:00:53,811
"You will also face
the storms and hardships."

5
00:02:28,334 --> 00:02:29,392
Come in, dear. Come in.

6
00:02:32,614 --> 00:02:34,621
There's nothing to fear.
Come in, dear.

7
00:02:38,235 --> 00:02:41,336
Nepu, don't scare her off.

8
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,348
You don't have a mind.

9
00:02:44,047 --> 00:02:47,217
She came to a new place.
She is such an innocent girl.

10
00:02:50,214 --> 00:02:51,624
Let's leave them now.

11
00:03:21,315 --> 00:03:23,994
They are peeping into my room.
Rascals.

12
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:28,996
You might be shameless,
but I am not.

13
00:03:30,687 --> 00:03:33,130
Now you can peep as
long as you want to.

14
00:03:34,574 --> 00:03:36,165
Now go to hell.

15
00:03:49,682 --> 00:03:52,676
I heard that you are Anand Moi.

16
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,637
Why are you so Nirananad(dull) Moi?

17
00:03:56,871 --> 00:03:59,551
So? What's the matter?

18
00:04:01,766 --> 00:04:03,419
Come here.

19
00:04:06,687 --> 00:04:07,924
Couldn't you hear I asked
you to come here!

20
00:04:09,844 --> 00:04:12,707
Stop acting in front of me.
I have seen many such acts.

21
00:04:13,442 --> 00:04:15,293
I know the women species very well.

22
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,799
You are still standing there?
I said, come here.

23
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:35,478
Pretending as if you're the
most novice person on earth.

24
00:04:41,361 --> 00:04:44,890
Oh God! So tears came
out of your eyes?

25
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,884
They are flowing...
River Ganges and Jamuna...

26
00:04:48,964 --> 00:04:50,599
...are flowing through your eyes.

27
00:04:56,116 --> 00:04:58,407
Take this. Wipe out your tears.

28
00:04:59,558 --> 00:05:01,353
If you don't stop it
I will give you a tight slap.

29
00:05:06,503 --> 00:05:09,490
There you go.
You're a good girl. You're a nice girl.

30
00:05:11,423 --> 00:05:12,489
Remove the veil.

31
00:05:13,524 --> 00:05:14,776
I said remove the veil completely.

32
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,024
I want to see your face.

33
00:05:17,036 --> 00:05:17,978
Remove it.

34
00:05:20,297 --> 00:05:22,451
Don't rub me the wrong way. Mind it.

35
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:25,858
When Nepha Chatterjee gets
upset people can't bear it.

36
00:05:27,067 --> 00:05:28,485
You don't want to see me angry, do you?

37
00:05:28,565 --> 00:05:30,094
I want to see your divine face once.

38
00:05:34,194 --> 00:05:36,745
Look at me. Look at me.

39
00:05:37,654 --> 00:05:40,742
Look at the dot between
both my eyes.

40
00:05:41,144 --> 00:05:44,288
I want to check if you are
squint-eyed or normal.

41
00:05:45,196 --> 00:05:48,301
Squint-eyed people completely repel me.
Look at me!

42
00:05:57,582 --> 00:05:58,862
No, you are not squint-eyed.

43
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:03,102
I just wanted to see
if mother was right.

44
00:06:04,329 --> 00:06:06,062
She was praising your
beauty too much.

45
00:06:06,828 --> 00:06:10,294
I can't bear it. Honestly.

46
00:06:11,284 --> 00:06:14,100
But after I married you
I can't leave you, can I?

47
00:06:14,923 --> 00:06:18,583
If I liked you or not,
if you liked me or not...

48
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:19,956
...talking about these
things are imperative.

49
00:06:20,036 --> 00:06:23,946
But yes, there are a couple
of things I need to tell you.

50
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:29,966
Or else later on you will say
that I am fraudster, thief, liar...

51
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:36,102
The thing is that we
have a theatre party.

52
00:06:38,343 --> 00:06:40,821
I will be returning late
from there everyday.

53
00:06:42,766 --> 00:06:43,686
I can't even tell you
when I would return.

54
00:06:45,631 --> 00:06:48,511
Once in a while I might even
return in a drunken state...

55
00:06:49,631 --> 00:06:52,189
I can also go to watch dance
performances in brothels.

56
00:06:53,829 --> 00:06:57,212
I am a descendant of a royal family.

57
00:06:57,744 --> 00:06:59,031
That's why I am bound to
have such regal pursuits.

58
00:06:59,111 --> 00:07:01,744
You need to overlook
such minor flaws, ok?

59
00:07:02,173 --> 00:07:04,124
And if you nag me about
these things...

60
00:07:04,664 --> 00:07:06,214
...I will bash you up and kick
you out of this house.

61
00:07:09,654 --> 00:07:12,364
It's a matter of fifty years ago.

62
00:07:13,859 --> 00:07:16,367
But my husband's first words
on our wedding night...

63
00:07:16,447 --> 00:07:18,799
...are still afresh in my ears.

64
00:07:19,878 --> 00:07:22,037
I feel like it happened
just a few days ago.

65
00:07:22,694 --> 00:07:25,067
Those were different times, dear.

66
00:07:26,948 --> 00:07:30,478
Husbands wouldn't see their
wives for long stretches...

67
00:07:31,108 --> 00:07:35,294
At that time a man's real
home was outside his house.

68
00:07:35,924 --> 00:07:38,561
And we were also novice.

69
00:07:39,328 --> 00:07:44,241
But yes, my husband
was a good person.

70
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:47,441
He used to say a few things
when he used to get upset...

71
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:50,412
...but he had a heart of child.

72
00:07:51,664 --> 00:07:54,239
When he went out to collect
offerings for his troupe...

73
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,211
"Give us your offerings."

74
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:02,184
"And help some lives survive."

75
00:08:02,264 --> 00:08:06,177
"Give us your offerings."

76
00:08:06,257 --> 00:08:10,217
"And help some lives survive."

77
00:08:10,297 --> 00:08:14,168
"God will give you His blessings."

78
00:08:14,248 --> 00:08:18,103
"He will fulfill your wishes."

79
00:08:18,183 --> 00:08:21,745
"There will be no sorrows anymore..."

80
00:08:21,825 --> 00:08:25,223
"...in the whole of India."

81
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,741
"All the travelers
are on a long voyage."

82
00:08:30,038 --> 00:08:33,663
"Your feet also graced that land."

83
00:08:34,688 --> 00:08:39,940
"You will also face..."

84
00:08:40,161 --> 00:08:44,541
"...storms and hardships."

85
00:08:46,554 --> 00:08:54,355
"Give us your offerings and
help some lives survive."

86
00:08:54,435 --> 00:08:58,195
"God will give you His blessings."

87
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,542
"He will fulfill your wishes."

88
00:09:00,622 --> 00:09:02,593
That was the last time I saw him.

89
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:06,834
He left with the donation money...

90
00:09:07,288 --> 00:09:08,423
...for his shows.

91
00:09:10,946 --> 00:09:13,342
I don't like to talk about the
same thing day after day.

92
00:09:13,947 --> 00:09:15,083
Now you go home.

93
00:09:15,645 --> 00:09:18,305
Let me go home and
have a cup of tea.

94
00:09:24,099 --> 00:09:26,382
I say that I don't like to talk
about the same thing day after day...

95
00:09:27,561 --> 00:09:29,009
...but the truth is that I like it a lot.

96
00:09:30,025 --> 00:09:31,534
I am able to spend the remaining
days of my life...

97
00:09:31,614 --> 00:09:33,181
...only with the help of
the memories of the past.

98
00:09:36,402 --> 00:09:42,272
"...in the whole of India."

99
00:10:20,603 --> 00:10:22,258
You couldn't recognize me, aunt?

100
00:10:22,338 --> 00:10:27,263
I am Montu.
My uncle is Nepha Chatterjee.

101
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,879
That is your dead husband.

102
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:33,759
That means my father is your
Padmabhushan Chakraborty.

103
00:10:34,685 --> 00:10:38,285
I see. You are my brother-in-law's son?

104
00:10:39,917 --> 00:10:41,232
Come in, son. Come in.

105
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:46,133
Please don't mind, son.
I couldn't recognize you.

106
00:10:46,382 --> 00:10:50,587
It's quite natural.
We lost touch since a long time.

107
00:10:52,046 --> 00:10:53,779
You are right, son.

108
00:10:54,965 --> 00:10:59,922
If I had my own children they
might've been in touch with you.

109
00:11:00,717 --> 00:11:03,247
Everyone would've known everyone.

110
00:11:04,057 --> 00:11:06,264
Sit down, son.
- It's alright. - Sit down.

111
00:11:10,923 --> 00:11:15,799
How is your father?
- No, he passed away a year ago.

112
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,302
Oh no! What are you saying!

113
00:11:19,897 --> 00:11:21,951
You didn't inform me about it, son?

114
00:11:22,156 --> 00:11:25,207
I didn't even know that
you are living here.

115
00:11:25,464 --> 00:11:27,763
Just one month ago I came
to know that you are...

116
00:11:27,843 --> 00:11:28,977
...still surviving here.

117
00:11:29,057 --> 00:11:31,993
I get a post-card from
Vijaya once in a while.

118
00:11:32,707 --> 00:11:37,052
My other brother-in-law's sons.
From Bhuto and Kelo.

119
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:41,168
Only then do I realize
that there's a world...

120
00:11:41,248 --> 00:11:44,999
...outside this house.
Would you like to have some tea?

121
00:11:45,669 --> 00:11:46,858
Only if it's not a trouble for you.

122
00:11:46,938 --> 00:11:50,826
No, it won't be trouble for me.
I am so happy to see you here.

123
00:11:50,906 --> 00:11:53,838
My heart is filled with joy.
God bless you, son.

124
00:11:53,918 --> 00:11:56,995
God bless you.
May God give you a lot of happiness...

125
00:11:58,382 --> 00:12:01,593
Mother passed away
even before father.

126
00:12:02,642 --> 00:12:05,696
What are you saying!
Am I the only one left...

127
00:12:07,983 --> 00:12:13,821
Everyone has left one by one
and I am still stuck here.

128
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:15,578
That's the reason I came here, aunt.

129
00:12:16,297 --> 00:12:18,869
Why would you stay here
alone when we are there?

130
00:12:19,204 --> 00:12:21,382
We won't let you stay here.
Lotu said that...

131
00:12:21,462 --> 00:12:25,777
Lotu? Who's Lotu, son?
- My wife, my better-half.

132
00:12:25,857 --> 00:12:27,939
Lotu said that it would've
been our responsibility...

133
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:30,004
...to look after our parents
if they were alive...

134
00:12:32,004 --> 00:12:35,054
...in the same way we have a
responsibility towards aunt.

135
00:12:35,345 --> 00:12:36,880
She asked me to come here
and bring you home.

136
00:12:37,118 --> 00:12:38,732
That's why I came here
to take you home.

137
00:12:39,603 --> 00:12:41,841
Where will you take me to?
- Why?

138
00:12:41,921 --> 00:12:46,606
To our home, in Kolkatta.
- To Kolkatta? To your home?

139
00:12:47,691 --> 00:12:49,739
I never dreamt this
even in my dreams.

140
00:12:49,983 --> 00:12:53,561
Oh come on! You are our
near one. You are family.

141
00:12:53,972 --> 00:12:56,399
God bless you, son.
May God give you lots of happiness!

142
00:12:56,479 --> 00:12:57,553
God bless you.

143
00:12:58,328 --> 00:13:01,081
Sometimes I too feel very
lonely here, son.

144
00:13:01,452 --> 00:13:03,616
Mostly when I am ill or something...

145
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,419
At that time I just take
lord's name and weep.

146
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:12,468
I say, O lord, people don't
have money and property...

147
00:13:13,495 --> 00:13:16,316
...but at least they have their
near and dear ones with them.

148
00:13:17,267 --> 00:13:18,554
Don't I have anyone?

149
00:13:18,634 --> 00:13:20,208
You need not stay
here alone anymore.

150
00:13:20,288 --> 00:13:21,895
You will stay with us
from now onwards.

151
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:25,793
I think God sent you here, son.

152
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:32,732
But what about my home, garden...

153
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,934
And the land and the crops...

154
00:13:36,014 --> 00:13:38,135
You can come here whenever
you feel like coming here.

155
00:13:38,857 --> 00:13:40,812
Kolkatta is not too
far away from here.

156
00:13:41,616 --> 00:13:44,016
There is no need for you
to leave your money here.

157
00:13:44,316 --> 00:13:47,884
I am an old lady.
Won't I be a burden on you?

158
00:13:50,002 --> 00:13:51,094
You are surprising!

159
00:14:10,469 --> 00:14:13,375
Son. Son, once I will go to Kalighat.

160
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:14,979
Definitely.
Whenever you feel like going there.

161
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:19,095
Once I went to Kalighat with
your uncle after my wedding.

162
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,020
He asked me to sit at the temple...

163
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,197
...and said that he would
return in a while.

164
00:14:25,234 --> 00:14:27,840
When he returned after
two longs hours...

165
00:14:28,305 --> 00:14:30,196
...he was in a completely
drunken state.

166
00:14:30,834 --> 00:14:33,435
Oh God! He was unable
to handle himself...

167
00:14:33,515 --> 00:14:36,596
...and he was trying to
cover me in the crowd.

168
00:14:43,206 --> 00:14:45,197
Please come in, aunt.
Please come in.

169
00:14:46,142 --> 00:14:50,142
How could we have let you
stay alone in the village!

170
00:14:56,175 --> 00:14:58,547
It's alright, dear. It's alright.

171
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:00,413
God bless you.
May God fill your life with happiness!

172
00:15:00,493 --> 00:15:03,537
Please come.
Get fresh and have some sweets...

173
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:06,828
...I made for you.
- Montu, just see how concerned...

174
00:15:07,354 --> 00:15:11,916
...your wife is for me.
She's such a nice girl.

175
00:15:12,532 --> 00:15:14,002
I have got so many relatives.

176
00:15:14,082 --> 00:15:17,754
But there is no one who thought
about this old lady.

177
00:15:17,938 --> 00:15:20,662
What are you saying, aunt!
It's our duty.

178
00:15:21,592 --> 00:15:23,289
Both of us lost our parents.

179
00:15:23,948 --> 00:15:25,250
You will live here like our mother.

180
00:15:26,035 --> 00:15:28,651
You say such sweet things,
daughter-in-law.

181
00:15:29,051 --> 00:15:30,698
You studied a lot, didn't you?

182
00:15:30,778 --> 00:15:32,973
No, I just managed
to pass MA somehow.

183
00:15:33,053 --> 00:15:35,776
That too in economics, aunt.
It's a tough subject.

184
00:15:36,651 --> 00:15:38,932
But she's very good at economics.

185
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:42,041
Oh come on! Just cut that crap.

186
00:15:42,121 --> 00:15:43,591
Don't embarrass me.

187
00:15:43,937 --> 00:15:46,123
My daughter-in-law is
really very sweet.

188
00:15:47,299 --> 00:15:50,899
But why is your face
not so sweet, dear?

189
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,991
It looks so dull.

190
00:15:55,699 --> 00:15:58,704
I got it. The evil government
raised the prices of pulses...

191
00:15:59,255 --> 00:16:04,930
...and sugar and you lost the
sweetness from your face.

192
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,141
Did you get upset, dear?
I was just kidding.

193
00:16:10,221 --> 00:16:13,614
Why would I get upset, aunt?
What you said is right.

194
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:17,967
In this city people are
somehow surviving...

195
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,935
...on medication.
In your times people used...

196
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,816
...to have milk and curd,
and good healthy food...

197
00:16:22,896 --> 00:16:25,419
Yes, and along with that we
used to get husband's...

198
00:16:25,499 --> 00:16:28,075
...slaps and kicks.
You miss that as well?

199
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:30,508
Today's husbands don't do that.

200
00:16:30,897 --> 00:16:35,178
It's said that women
and men are equal.

201
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:39,546
I was not in your place, or else
I would've shown what I can...

202
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:44,876
Montu, your wife is quite
short-tempered.

203
00:16:45,678 --> 00:16:48,616
And here's your granddaughter Tinku.

204
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,562
Go to your granny.
- O lord!

205
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:52,486
You are so strong.
I thought you would be weak.

206
00:16:53,384 --> 00:16:57,811
Did you see how happy
she looks with her granny?

207
00:16:58,076 --> 00:16:59,628
That's the strength
of the blood ties.

208
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:02,824
My lovely granddaughter.

209
00:17:04,216 --> 00:17:07,946
Daughter-in-law,
do you have only one child or...

210
00:17:09,405 --> 00:17:12,494
No, actually... Actually bringing
up just one child...

211
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:15,700
...is so difficult, aunt.
- O God! Now what's that!

212
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:18,129
How can it be called a family
unless you have children!

213
00:17:18,356 --> 00:17:19,911
That was the mindset
of your times, aunt.

214
00:17:20,046 --> 00:17:21,282
And today's thinking
is that if you...

215
00:17:21,362 --> 00:17:23,189
...can't bring up the
children properly, then...

216
00:17:24,184 --> 00:17:25,340
Do you want to say something?

217
00:17:26,853 --> 00:17:30,844
Aunt, now you get fresh...
- Yes, you are right.

218
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,925
Give me the baby. Hold her.

219
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,138
Come.

220
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,612
Aunt, I have got a small request.

221
00:17:42,098 --> 00:17:45,817
You can't walk bare foot in Kolkatta.
You will have to wear sandals.

222
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:48,876
Sandals? What are you saying!

223
00:17:48,956 --> 00:17:50,281
You want me to wear sandals?

224
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:53,296
Aunt, I will bring pure
cotton sandals for you.

225
00:17:53,492 --> 00:17:55,690
God won't get upset with you, aunt.

226
00:17:56,184 --> 00:17:59,373
Actually the thing is that
Kolkatta's street are unclean...

227
00:17:59,633 --> 00:18:02,298
And if your feet get infected
baby might also get affected.

228
00:18:03,189 --> 00:18:05,438
Come, I will show you the bathroom.

229
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,579
Get fresh.

230
00:18:07,659 --> 00:18:09,237
There's the tap where
water comes from river Ganges.

231
00:18:09,533 --> 00:18:10,625
If you wish you can also take bath...

232
00:18:10,705 --> 00:18:11,836
...under that tap from
tomorrow onwards.

233
00:18:17,684 --> 00:18:21,712
The boy went for fishing
to the banks of a river...

234
00:18:21,792 --> 00:18:27,424
Say it. - The boy went for fishing
to the banks of a river...

235
00:18:27,651 --> 00:18:33,323
But the frog came...
- But the frog came...

236
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:37,867
...and took away the fish.
...and took away the fish.

237
00:18:37,947 --> 00:18:39,549
Wow!

238
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,624
Can you give me 10 paisa?

239
00:18:52,704 --> 00:18:55,709
Please give me 10 paisa.
Chunchuni and I will eat.

240
00:18:56,657 --> 00:19:00,073
Who are you, son?
You look like sweet little angels.

241
00:19:00,153 --> 00:19:03,511
She is my sister Chunchuni.
We are very hungry.

242
00:19:03,591 --> 00:19:06,419
We didn't eat anything since morning.
Honestly.

243
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:11,294
O God! What are you saying!
How reckless are you parents!

244
00:19:11,867 --> 00:19:13,391
What sort of people are they!

245
00:19:13,607 --> 00:19:16,753
They left you without feeding
you in the morning.

246
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:19,337
Take this 25 paisa. Take it.

247
00:19:20,722 --> 00:19:22,383
Which country did I come to!

248
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:25,499
Kids are running on the streets
without eating anything...

249
00:19:25,579 --> 00:19:29,963
...and they are least bothered about it?
- Shontu. Hey, Shontu.

250
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:32,574
Shontu, stop. Shontu, stop there.

251
00:19:32,654 --> 00:19:35,195
Shontu, don't go. Hey, Shontu.
Shontu, stop.

252
00:19:35,389 --> 00:19:39,883
Shontu, stop. Shontu, listen.
Don't go there alone.

253
00:19:39,963 --> 00:19:42,022
They are more in number.
- I am not scared of them.

254
00:19:42,102 --> 00:19:43,360
I can handle all of them alone.

255
00:19:43,661 --> 00:19:45,137
They are trying to show off
their power in our locality?

256
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,586
Don't be stupid.
Brother Ravi said that...

257
00:19:47,899 --> 00:19:49,690
...they are carrying bombs
and weapons these days.

258
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:52,429
Who's scared of the weapons!
- Then go and die.

259
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:54,161
I will tell brother Ravi about you.

260
00:19:54,504 --> 00:19:58,083
You know what will happen if
I tell brother Ravi about it.

261
00:19:58,396 --> 00:20:03,445
To hell with brother Ravi!
Brother Ravi!

262
00:20:05,424 --> 00:20:12,408
Oh God! How aggressive
these kids are!

263
00:20:13,057 --> 00:20:16,419
Where did I came?

264
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,025
Give me two biscuits.

265
00:20:22,786 --> 00:20:24,980
Where did you get the money, Tuntun?

266
00:20:25,256 --> 00:20:28,384
A lady gave me the money.
- Did you hear his language!

267
00:20:28,464 --> 00:20:29,785
A 'lady' gave me?

268
00:20:30,472 --> 00:20:32,195
He's lucky with the ladies.

269
00:20:33,575 --> 00:20:36,504
Just think about
the future of this country.

270
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:39,856
Look at the political situation.

271
00:20:39,936 --> 00:20:42,461
On one side there's China and on
the other side there's America...

272
00:20:42,678 --> 00:20:44,840
...and in the middle we
are lying helpless.

273
00:20:45,316 --> 00:20:48,213
No hands, no legs, just a head.
Quarrelling.

274
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:55,584
Hey, I gave you such pearls of wisdom.
Get me half cup tea.

275
00:20:55,664 --> 00:20:57,976
And I have been tolerating
you till now.

276
00:20:58,056 --> 00:20:59,785
You must also get me half
cup tea for that.

277
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,450
I shouldn't have messed with you.

278
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:03,455
You have learnt to talk these days.

279
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:11,391
Take it from my cup.
Stop quarrelling here.

280
00:21:12,012 --> 00:21:13,274
You are causing me a headache.

281
00:21:13,499 --> 00:21:14,667
Brother Ravi...

282
00:21:15,747 --> 00:21:17,776
Brother Ravi, Chenu's men are
showing off their power...

283
00:21:17,856 --> 00:21:19,616
...in our locality.
- I told Ranu that I will go there...

284
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:21,456
...and teach them a lesson,
but he said that you...

285
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:23,153
...barred me from getting into fights.
- Yes.

286
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,820
Don't mess with Chenu's
men empty-handed.

287
00:21:26,732 --> 00:21:28,020
They are carrying
weapons these days.

288
00:21:30,062 --> 00:21:32,332
Jhontu, can you solve
it or should I get up?

289
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,317
I will teach him a quick lesson.
I will kick him out of here...

290
00:21:34,397 --> 00:21:37,694
No, don't kick him out.
Bring him to me.

291
00:21:39,023 --> 00:21:40,504
Nimai, Manu, go with him.

292
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:45,855
Jhontu, stay here.
- What? - Stay here.

293
00:21:46,407 --> 00:21:48,005
Why? What's wrong if I go with them?

294
00:21:48,245 --> 00:21:51,607
Sit here. - Sit here! As if
I am the root cause of all trouble.

295
00:22:10,097 --> 00:22:11,359
Why are you standing here, son?

296
00:22:11,553 --> 00:22:13,020
Are you waiting for someone?

297
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,364
How does it bother you, old lady!
Get lost from here.

298
00:22:15,716 --> 00:22:19,240
Just hear his language.
Hey, I am of your grandma's age.

299
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,819
Didn't you learn how
to talk to elders!

300
00:22:21,013 --> 00:22:22,678
I will bash you up and
kick you out of here.

301
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,861
Do you know whom you are talking to?
- I know.

302
00:22:24,941 --> 00:22:27,974
I am talking to a child
of my grandson's age...

303
00:22:28,223 --> 00:22:30,175
...who unfortunately still
haven't grown up.

304
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:32,969
What sort of language!
What sort of attitude!

305
00:22:33,049 --> 00:22:34,311
What's the matter?

306
00:22:35,445 --> 00:22:40,050
Mr. Anukul.
So how come you are here?

307
00:22:40,612 --> 00:22:43,921
Sir, it's been a long
time since we saw you.

308
00:22:44,001 --> 00:22:46,633
Sir, our eyes were dying to see you.

309
00:22:47,152 --> 00:22:50,521
When you would grace this land,
when we could see you...

310
00:22:50,601 --> 00:22:52,459
You need not show off your teeth.
- Sorry.

311
00:22:53,444 --> 00:22:55,574
You learnt to make fun
of your father these days.

312
00:22:55,876 --> 00:22:59,066
No, we are making fun
of you. We are just...

313
00:22:59,146 --> 00:23:01,444
We are welcoming you.
- Yes.

314
00:23:02,158 --> 00:23:05,249
"Welcome. Welcome to our place."

315
00:23:05,974 --> 00:23:08,612
"You came here and..."

316
00:23:10,331 --> 00:23:14,218
Scoundrel, get up. Get up.

317
00:23:15,131 --> 00:23:16,894
You were showing off your
power to an old lady?

318
00:23:17,726 --> 00:23:20,785
Beat him up. - You came here
to show off your power?

319
00:23:21,225 --> 00:23:22,342
Scoundrel.

320
00:23:27,766 --> 00:23:29,563
What's going on?
Why are you beating him?

321
00:23:29,901 --> 00:23:31,294
Why are you fighting?

322
00:23:31,374 --> 00:23:34,094
Hey, look at them.

323
00:23:34,699 --> 00:23:37,775
Open the door.
Open the door and see...

324
00:23:37,855 --> 00:23:40,201
See what these kids are doing.

325
00:23:51,594 --> 00:23:54,916
Come inside. Come inside.
- Look what's going on.

326
00:23:55,251 --> 00:23:57,597
God! They will kill each other.

327
00:23:59,206 --> 00:24:00,852
Beat him.

328
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,767
They will start throwing bombs
at each other in a moment.

329
00:24:11,847 --> 00:24:14,204
This is a regular occurrence, aunt.

330
00:24:14,647 --> 00:24:16,733
Don't stay out with
Tinku for so long.

331
00:24:17,058 --> 00:24:18,031
Now you saw Kolkatta's condition.

332
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:26,495
Stay here.

333
00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:28,875
Brother Ravi. Brother Ravi,
you were right.

334
00:24:29,382 --> 00:24:32,377
We got these bombs and this
knife from his pocket.

335
00:24:38,885 --> 00:24:41,894
Ravi. Ravi, please don't
do anything in my stall.

336
00:24:42,528 --> 00:24:44,226
Please deal with him
Outside...

337
00:24:49,242 --> 00:24:51,039
Why were you roaming with bombs
and knife in this area?

338
00:24:51,555 --> 00:24:54,236
I do what I feel like doing.
This is not your father's area, is it?

339
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:57,842
I will tear your tongue apart.

340
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,507
Do you think only you have
got bombs and knives...

341
00:25:00,853 --> 00:25:04,074
No one else have them? Get up. Get up.

342
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:06,673
Why did you come to this locality?

343
00:25:06,933 --> 00:25:09,264
The family that moved into 11/1.
- Mr. Mohal's daughter.

344
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,097
What do you got to do with her?

345
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:13,681
Why? Is Shobita your sister
that I have to tell you?

346
00:25:13,761 --> 00:25:14,972
Shut your mouth.

347
00:25:21,378 --> 00:25:23,573
So you still didn't learn the lesson.

348
00:25:27,924 --> 00:25:29,530
What's going on over here!

349
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:31,308
Why are you fighting here?
- What fight!

350
00:25:31,773 --> 00:25:33,318
Is there no law and
order in this place?

351
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:35,567
You mind your own business, sir.
This is our private matter.

352
00:25:36,183 --> 00:25:37,832
Private matter? Nonsense!

353
00:25:38,572 --> 00:25:42,616
Sir. Sir, listen. Listen.
Say it again what you just said.

354
00:25:43,135 --> 00:25:44,772
I would've offered
something to the guest.

355
00:25:44,852 --> 00:25:46,841
Brother Ravi, he's Shobita's father.

356
00:25:47,373 --> 00:25:52,847
Sir. Sir. Sir. You were asking
why we were fighting...

357
00:25:53,805 --> 00:25:55,524
That scoundrel... Look at him.

358
00:25:56,811 --> 00:25:58,097
He came to meet your daughter.

359
00:25:58,733 --> 00:26:01,228
He wants to be your son-in-law.
- Indiscipline. Rascal.

360
00:26:01,308 --> 00:26:02,865
Beware!
- Ravi.

361
00:26:06,844 --> 00:26:11,871
What? - Till now you didn't
learn how one should talk to elders?

362
00:26:13,568 --> 00:26:14,768
You are on your way to office, father.
You better go to the office.

363
00:26:15,287 --> 00:26:17,012
Don't interfere in my matter.

364
00:26:25,126 --> 00:26:29,246
Catch him. Catch him. Catch him.

365
00:26:29,419 --> 00:26:32,856
Catch him. Catch him.

366
00:26:35,363 --> 00:26:40,866
These kids look like angels but
their behavior is so poor.

367
00:26:41,461 --> 00:26:42,519
Let's go.

368
00:26:43,093 --> 00:26:46,001
You put Tinku to bed
by 11 O' clock, ok?

369
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,705
She will sleep for a few
hours and then give her...

370
00:26:49,785 --> 00:26:51,601
...a glass of milk at 4 O' clock, ok?

371
00:26:52,109 --> 00:26:53,915
We would return by 5:30 pm.

372
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:56,937
Do they give her salary?
- Yes, she gets 400 rupees.

373
00:26:57,201 --> 00:26:59,050
Can a family survive with one
salary these days, aunt?

374
00:26:59,255 --> 00:27:00,337
Let's go.

375
00:27:09,277 --> 00:27:13,024
How dare you to misbehave
with me, scoundrel!

376
00:27:13,104 --> 00:27:14,586
Beware, you dog!

377
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:16,434
If you have any affinity
towards your life...

378
00:27:16,514 --> 00:27:19,364
...then stay away from me.
Virendra. Virendra.

379
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,926
Where are you, Virendra?
Come to my rescue.

380
00:27:22,272 --> 00:27:26,208
Whom shall I call for help?

381
00:27:26,392 --> 00:27:30,370
There's fire and danger all around.

382
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,644
Stay away from me, you devil.

383
00:27:33,073 --> 00:27:38,101
God will punish you for your sin.

384
00:27:40,587 --> 00:27:43,527
I am bidding this world goodbye.

385
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,798
"There honey in your voice."

386
00:27:58,288 --> 00:28:03,235
"Your beautiful smile..."

387
00:28:03,441 --> 00:28:05,215
Now there's another play.

388
00:28:05,295 --> 00:28:07,283
I will have to perform
Chintamani's part well.

389
00:28:07,363 --> 00:28:09,092
Why do you play female's parts?
- Why?

390
00:28:09,432 --> 00:28:11,982
You showed your nature.
Sometimes you get on my nerves.

391
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,740
You criticize everything.

392
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,097
Ok, fine. I won't say anything now.

393
00:28:15,722 --> 00:28:18,403
Stay quiet if you want to
get meals two times a day.

394
00:28:26,293 --> 00:28:27,351
Did you get upset?

395
00:28:28,533 --> 00:28:30,820
Forget it. Come closer.

396
00:28:31,231 --> 00:28:33,290
Female parts are difficult parts.

397
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,689
Your make-up, your body language...

398
00:28:35,769 --> 00:28:37,668
...your eye-movements,
your expressions...

399
00:28:37,748 --> 00:28:39,242
...managing all these things
is not child's play.

400
00:28:39,322 --> 00:28:40,944
No one in this province
can play those parts.

401
00:28:41,311 --> 00:28:45,073
Will you get me a sari after
a good theatre project?

402
00:28:46,014 --> 00:28:47,880
Your father doesn't supply saris,
does he?

403
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,782
Don't bring my father into this.

404
00:28:50,299 --> 00:28:53,012
Did they tell you how much
your salary is? - Salary?

405
00:28:54,212 --> 00:28:56,196
What salary?
- What are you saying!

406
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:57,412
They are not giving you a salary?

407
00:28:57,492 --> 00:28:58,872
You are working here for
just two meals a day?

408
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:02,656
What are you saying!
Why would they pay me salary?

409
00:29:03,099 --> 00:29:05,878
What do I do here?
- Oh!

410
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:07,880
So what you are doing
is not called work?

411
00:29:08,267 --> 00:29:10,570
You are babysitting the baby,
giving her a bath...

412
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:14,352
...feeding her, putting her to bed...
Isn't it called work?

413
00:29:15,305 --> 00:29:18,582
You are making me laugh. Do
they have to pay me a salary for that?

414
00:29:19,371 --> 00:29:22,062
I am their aunt.
He is my nephew...

415
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:25,358
I see. So where was
your nephew till now?

416
00:29:25,438 --> 00:29:28,084
And how come he is so
concerned about you all of a sudden?

417
00:29:30,928 --> 00:29:33,760
I am unable to understand
whatever you are saying.

418
00:29:34,551 --> 00:29:36,238
Who will look after their baby now?

419
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:38,854
In today's times they
have to shell out...

420
00:29:38,934 --> 00:29:43,389
...at least 30 rupees for a maid
excluding her food and clothes.

421
00:29:44,162 --> 00:29:47,222
They brought you here
to save some money.

422
00:29:47,302 --> 00:29:48,994
If you wish I can get
you a maid's job...

423
00:29:49,074 --> 00:29:50,865
...with 30 rupees salary right now.

424
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:54,888
They will give me money?
- I told you, if you are ready...

425
00:29:54,968 --> 00:29:56,508
...you can see if I can
get you a job or not.

426
00:29:56,735 --> 00:29:58,627
If you were a few years
younger then I would've...

427
00:29:58,811 --> 00:30:00,895
...got you a job with
50 rupees salary.

428
00:30:01,568 --> 00:30:04,616
These days it's easy to
give birth to kids...

429
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:07,362
...but it's very difficult
to look after them.

430
00:30:08,411 --> 00:30:09,535
No one has sufficient time.

431
00:30:10,292 --> 00:30:12,691
But yes, these days people
don't have more than one or two kids.

432
00:30:12,771 --> 00:30:15,740
That means after so long
lord's words came true.

433
00:30:16,295 --> 00:30:19,352
Whose words?
- Lord Ramakrishna's words.

434
00:30:19,664 --> 00:30:21,866
He used to say that after the
birth of a couple of kids...

435
00:30:21,946 --> 00:30:25,027
...the husband and wife become
as close as siblings.

436
00:30:25,664 --> 00:30:26,821
Siblings?

437
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:30,345
When I see them every cell
in my body starts burning.

438
00:30:47,275 --> 00:30:49,714
After that old lady's arrival
I am relieved about Tinku.

439
00:30:49,794 --> 00:30:51,260
But I doubt if that old
lady would stick here.

440
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,449
She will definitely stick here.

441
00:30:52,529 --> 00:30:54,183
We will have to handle
her a bit tactfully.

442
00:30:54,377 --> 00:30:55,876
Just talk to her once in a while,
show her a bit of concern...

443
00:30:55,956 --> 00:30:59,026
...get something for her to eat
and she will be in your hands.

444
00:30:59,417 --> 00:31:01,891
Just one month ago you brought
another aunt of yours.

445
00:31:02,205 --> 00:31:04,703
We did all these things even then,
but she didn't stay here.

446
00:31:05,157 --> 00:31:07,784
She was a bit smart, but this
woman is from a village.

447
00:31:08,173 --> 00:31:08,973
There will be no problems at all.

448
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:25,448
Tea and one plate chicken cutlets.

449
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,749
Shall I say something?

450
00:31:31,145 --> 00:31:34,431
We shall give your aunt
10-15 rupees per month...

451
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:35,897
If she gets money...
- No. No.

452
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,913
You will spoil her by
giving her money.

453
00:31:39,167 --> 00:31:40,831
She will get habituated
to the money.

454
00:31:42,029 --> 00:31:44,470
If we give her 15 she will
want 20, then 25, then 30...

455
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:46,825
...then 40, there will
be no end to it.

456
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:52,609
Instead of that we can
buy a radio with...

457
00:31:52,689 --> 00:31:56,181
...that money on monthly
installment basis.

458
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:58,170
She seems to be a good person.

459
00:31:58,527 --> 00:32:04,527
She works hard.
And also she's pretty clean.

460
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:07,243
These days we can't leave
the kids under these maids.

461
00:32:07,966 --> 00:32:09,122
They spoil them.

462
00:32:10,884 --> 00:32:12,128
What happened? Why are you laughing?

463
00:32:12,625 --> 00:32:14,250
I remembered something.
- What's that?

464
00:32:14,754 --> 00:32:17,721
Forget it. You will get angry.
- Tell me what it is.

465
00:32:18,517 --> 00:32:21,987
You mastered the art of
trapping old ladies.

466
00:32:56,203 --> 00:33:00,027
Did you take Tinku out, aunt?
- Yes, dear.

467
00:33:01,089 --> 00:33:03,370
I took her out to the nearby park.

468
00:33:07,337 --> 00:33:10,127
She didn't give you any trouble,
did she? - No, dear.

469
00:33:10,391 --> 00:33:12,851
What are you saying!
- You had tea?

470
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:16,004
No. Now you came here, I will
worship the lord for a while...

471
00:33:16,084 --> 00:33:17,530
...and then have some food.

472
00:33:19,284 --> 00:33:23,241
Montu... - Yes. - You told
me that you would take me to Kalighat.

473
00:33:23,522 --> 00:33:24,731
Sure. Let's go.

474
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:27,601
Aunt, will it be ok if you
go to Kalighat tomorrow?

475
00:33:27,879 --> 00:33:30,602
We were thinking of going
to a movie at 9 O' clock.

476
00:33:31,305 --> 00:33:34,646
Ok, you can go. I will go to
Kalighat some other time.

477
00:33:34,938 --> 00:33:38,700
No, we will not go now. We will
go after arranging your meals.

478
00:33:39,965 --> 00:33:42,614
Take this.
I brought bananas for you.

479
00:33:47,187 --> 00:33:51,055
Montu, your wife is a smart girl.

480
00:33:51,801 --> 00:33:53,185
She has an eye on everything.

481
00:33:54,294 --> 00:33:57,217
And yes, dear, tell me something.

482
00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:00,688
There were so many people,
but why did you...

483
00:34:00,882 --> 00:34:04,309
...think of me all of a sudden?
Why did you bring me here?

484
00:34:05,412 --> 00:34:07,700
You are our near one, you were
alone in that village...

485
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:11,564
No, dear. I can't digest that.

486
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,337
I know why you brought me here.
- Sorry.

487
00:34:17,586 --> 00:34:21,319
It's not...
- What's there to feel ashamed of!

488
00:34:21,618 --> 00:34:26,234
You need not feel shy in front of me.
I am your near one.

489
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:53,437
Does Arun Mukherjee live here?
Pet name is Montu.

490
00:34:54,029 --> 00:34:56,709
Yes, but he is in office right now.
- I know that.

491
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:59,088
Everyone works in office
at this hour.

492
00:34:59,693 --> 00:35:03,809
I am... I am his brother.

493
00:35:03,889 --> 00:35:08,904
And does an old widow live here?
- Yes. Yes.

494
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:11,728
Sister Dauni.
- Will you please call her once?

495
00:35:12,537 --> 00:35:13,422
Come in.

496
00:35:14,433 --> 00:35:15,559
Sit down. I'll call her.

497
00:35:54,689 --> 00:35:56,933
Aunt, did you recognize me?

498
00:36:01,413 --> 00:36:04,765
I am Bilu... I mean Jatin.

499
00:36:04,845 --> 00:36:07,579
Your brother-in-law's son.

500
00:36:09,825 --> 00:36:13,516
It's alright.
Where did you get my address from?

501
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:16,381
I went to your home in village...

502
00:36:16,766 --> 00:36:19,598
There I came to know that you are...
- Tell me what you want.

503
00:36:22,539 --> 00:36:24,982
Can I sit down?
- Sit down.

504
00:36:35,262 --> 00:36:38,322
Are you married?
- Yes.

505
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:42,489
My wife's name is Mila.
- You have kids as well.

506
00:36:43,987 --> 00:36:48,550
One daughter.
- Your wife calls you on first name basis.

507
00:36:50,053 --> 00:36:54,418
Yes... She calls me Jotu.
- Your wife passed MA?

508
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:58,655
No. She passed BA.
- She works in office, doesn't she?

509
00:36:59,404 --> 00:37:01,998
Yes, but how did you know
all these things?

510
00:37:02,441 --> 00:37:07,696
Your wife Milu sent you to me.
She said that your aunt...

511
00:37:07,869 --> 00:37:12,513
...is living alone in a village,
and that she is your near one...

512
00:37:12,593 --> 00:37:14,571
...and that you must bring her home.
- Yes. Yes.

513
00:37:14,651 --> 00:37:18,614
You said it right. Mila said...
- I just said what she said.

514
00:37:24,967 --> 00:37:27,152
We are near ones when
we need each other...

515
00:37:27,232 --> 00:37:28,978
...and when we don't
we are strangers.

516
00:37:29,454 --> 00:37:32,254
After coming to Kolkatta
I came to know...

517
00:37:32,427 --> 00:37:34,401
...the difference between the
near ones and the strangers.

518
00:37:34,481 --> 00:37:36,361
Yes. That's for sure.
That's for sure.

519
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:39,492
You are my near one.

520
00:37:39,572 --> 00:37:41,863
You came to me because you
were concerned about me. - Yes.

521
00:37:42,339 --> 00:37:45,139
How much salary will I get, son?
- Sorry!

522
00:37:45,658 --> 00:37:51,427
Your wife and you will go to work,
you will go to movies...

523
00:37:51,507 --> 00:37:54,130
...you will enjoy life,
and I will look after your child...

524
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:56,262
...all day long and I won't
get salary for that?

525
00:37:56,502 --> 00:38:00,800
You are my aunt, you are our near one...
- I know that, son.

526
00:38:01,366 --> 00:38:05,259
I know how concerned you are for me.
What's the salary?

527
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:12,383
15 rupees.
- 20 rupees.

528
00:38:13,637 --> 00:38:14,923
20?

529
00:38:16,718 --> 00:38:20,620
20... Well, 20.

530
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:25,248
Then it's fine. And you will
also give me clothes...

531
00:38:25,328 --> 00:38:27,309
I don't want to embarrass a
near one by taking about it.

532
00:38:27,647 --> 00:38:31,410
Meals two times a day,
a glass of milk at night...

533
00:38:31,734 --> 00:38:33,940
...and snacks at evening.
That's sufficient for me.

534
00:38:36,723 --> 00:38:40,048
Alright.
- No, son. Don't say 'alright' so soon.

535
00:38:40,254 --> 00:38:45,151
First of all go home.
Talk to your wife tonight.

536
00:38:45,605 --> 00:38:49,281
And if she agrees you can
come here at this time...

537
00:38:50,013 --> 00:38:51,865
Don't come here on a holiday though.

538
00:38:52,135 --> 00:38:55,692
On a holiday the near ones
of this house will be here.

539
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:08,113
Can you give me 10 paisa?
- 10 paisa?

540
00:39:08,193 --> 00:39:11,208
Why? Has your father given
me 10 paisa to give you?

541
00:39:19,681 --> 00:39:20,816
Rascal!

542
00:39:31,764 --> 00:39:34,254
Chunchuni, didn't you
eat anything today?

543
00:39:34,924 --> 00:39:38,567
Go and take four biscuits from
the tea-stall on my account.

544
00:39:44,393 --> 00:39:45,563
Brother Ravi.

545
00:39:47,042 --> 00:39:49,896
Shontu and Manu went to college.
They won't come now.

546
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:51,452
Their college is closed.

547
00:39:51,532 --> 00:39:53,139
What did they go there for?
- I don't know.

548
00:39:58,977 --> 00:40:00,750
What's the matter?
Why are you shouting here?

549
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:03,431
We want to know the exams date.
- We want to know the exams date.

550
00:40:03,511 --> 00:40:05,809
One at a time. - We want to
know the examination date.

551
00:40:05,889 --> 00:40:06,911
We didn't get any notice till now.

552
00:40:06,991 --> 00:40:08,749
All the colleges got the notice
that exams are on 7th of March.

553
00:40:08,829 --> 00:40:10,524
We didn't get any notice yet.

554
00:40:10,604 --> 00:40:12,566
And if you want to know anything more
than that, you can go to the university.

555
00:40:12,773 --> 00:40:14,968
Don't keep on shouting here.
- We did go there.

556
00:40:15,142 --> 00:40:16,586
They said that notice has
been sent to the college.

557
00:40:16,666 --> 00:40:18,917
No, I am the principal here.
I would've known...

558
00:40:18,997 --> 00:40:21,072
...if we got any notice.
- Then you tell us what we should do.

559
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:22,391
Do whatever you want to do.

560
00:40:22,471 --> 00:40:23,602
Go on a strike in front
of the university.

561
00:40:23,682 --> 00:40:27,462
But don't create a scene here.
- Is that so! Come with me.

562
00:41:18,403 --> 00:41:19,871
Send police force immediately.

563
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:22,427
The students are breaking the
chairs and tables here...

564
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,251
The situation is out of our control.

565
00:41:24,606 --> 00:41:26,282
Send police as soon as possible.

566
00:41:28,996 --> 00:41:30,692
Police. Police is on their way here.

567
00:41:55,159 --> 00:41:56,953
What's the matter?
Where will you go?

568
00:41:57,594 --> 00:42:02,453
Shontu, run. Shontu,
they are too many in number...

569
00:42:02,533 --> 00:42:05,992
You run.
- Shontu, don't fight with them here.

570
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,376
Brother Ravi. Brother Ravi.

571
00:42:34,819 --> 00:42:36,830
Brother Ravi. Brother Ravi.

572
00:42:37,327 --> 00:42:38,696
We were returning from the college...

573
00:42:38,776 --> 00:42:40,128
...and Chenu caught Shontu.

574
00:42:41,802 --> 00:42:44,258
Where did they go?
- Towards Kola Bagan.

575
00:42:44,712 --> 00:42:47,010
They were 5-6 in number
and I asked Shontu...

576
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:48,729
...not to fight them over there,
I said that we should run.

577
00:42:49,469 --> 00:42:50,658
But he didn't listen to me.

578
00:43:22,755 --> 00:43:24,290
Where is Chenu?
- I don't know.

579
00:43:24,557 --> 00:43:26,711
Where has they taken Shontu?
- I said I don't know.

580
00:43:31,014 --> 00:43:32,301
Tell me where they are.

581
00:43:39,771 --> 00:43:41,797
Jhonte, stand there.
Manu, you stand here.

582
00:43:42,269 --> 00:43:43,332
You stay there.

583
00:43:47,848 --> 00:43:50,194
Chenu. Hey, Chenu.

584
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:54,512
I don't have a problem if you
want to start the old war...

585
00:43:55,264 --> 00:43:57,989
...but if you have the guts
to fight me then come out.

586
00:43:58,475 --> 00:44:00,670
Come out and show me your guts.

587
00:44:16,345 --> 00:44:19,480
Will you come out or do
you want me to come in?

588
00:44:23,276 --> 00:44:25,298
Brother Ravi. Brother Ravi,
they have tied me here.

589
00:44:25,378 --> 00:44:26,638
Brother Ravi.

590
00:44:32,498 --> 00:44:35,417
Brother Ravi.
- Chenu.

591
00:44:44,302 --> 00:44:45,360
What?

592
00:44:48,373 --> 00:44:51,206
If you dare to touch
him again, Chenu...

593
00:44:53,017 --> 00:44:55,504
...all the six bullets of this
pistol will be inside your skull.

594
00:44:56,228 --> 00:44:57,985
No one has the guts to save you.

595
00:44:58,693 --> 00:45:02,768
You know once I went to
jail because of you.

596
00:45:04,303 --> 00:45:06,411
Now I will kill you and get hanged.

597
00:45:10,518 --> 00:45:12,400
Anukul, let him go.

598
00:45:30,854 --> 00:45:32,789
Get lost, rascal.

599
00:45:37,245 --> 00:45:40,659
I don't like fighting anymore, Chenu.
I don't like fighting.

600
00:45:41,297 --> 00:45:42,930
Now stop these things.

601
00:45:57,369 --> 00:45:58,631
Ravi.

602
00:46:01,243 --> 00:46:03,072
I too have a pistol.

603
00:46:04,151 --> 00:46:06,276
You are lucky that it's
not with me today.

604
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:09,004
From next time onwards
keep it with you.

605
00:46:21,886 --> 00:46:23,914
Montu.
- Yes.

606
00:46:24,552 --> 00:46:26,984
I wanted to talk to you.
- Yes, aunt.

607
00:46:28,649 --> 00:46:31,460
Please sit down. Why are you standing?
- No, it's alright.

608
00:46:32,238 --> 00:46:34,649
I am happy that daughter-in-law
is also present.

609
00:46:34,907 --> 00:46:36,638
I want to talk straight.

610
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:40,108
How much salary will
you give me, son?

611
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:41,404
Salary?

612
00:46:44,649 --> 00:46:47,016
What are you saying?
- You stay quiet.

613
00:46:47,514 --> 00:46:50,424
She said it right.
She too needs some pocket-money.

614
00:46:51,114 --> 00:46:54,152
Aunt, we will give you
20 rupees per month.

615
00:46:54,952 --> 00:46:57,639
But don't call it salary,
it's for your daily expenses.

616
00:46:57,719 --> 00:47:05,644
Call it whatever you
want to call it.

617
00:47:06,034 --> 00:47:08,012
But I will take it as salary.

618
00:47:12,607 --> 00:47:13,665
Take it.

619
00:47:15,936 --> 00:47:19,147
You are a nice kid. God bless you.

620
00:47:20,238 --> 00:47:23,903
And listen, arrange meals
for me from somewhere else.

621
00:47:25,601 --> 00:47:30,693
I heard that the shop across
the corner sells curd and rabri.

622
00:47:31,493 --> 00:47:34,526
Arrange curd in summer
and rabri in winter.

623
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:37,645
What shall I bring today?
Curd or rabri?

624
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:40,683
You need not bring anything today.
Bring it from tomorrow.

625
00:47:40,763 --> 00:47:47,309
Alright.
- And yes, I won't trouble you for a raise.

626
00:47:48,423 --> 00:47:50,844
But yes, if someone gives
me a better salary...

627
00:47:50,924 --> 00:47:54,671
...then it's a different matter,
or else I will never leave you.

628
00:47:55,147 --> 00:47:57,050
And Tinku will also not
have any sort of trouble.

629
00:47:57,731 --> 00:48:00,779
After all you are my near ones, son.

630
00:48:01,406 --> 00:48:03,340
Ok, I shall go and read out
Ramayana for Tinku.

631
00:48:11,473 --> 00:48:16,716
"The eyes are in search of light."

632
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:22,359
"The heart is in
search of the light."

633
00:48:23,674 --> 00:48:29,973
"There's no light and hope near me."

634
00:48:30,395 --> 00:48:36,125
"The heart and soul is
waiting for that ray of light."

635
00:48:37,179 --> 00:48:39,613
"The sky and the earth..."

636
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,958
Don't these kids sleep at night?
We should leave this locality.

637
00:48:43,758 --> 00:48:45,633
Where will we go?
All the localities are one and the same.

638
00:48:47,045 --> 00:48:48,580
Only God can help this country.

639
00:48:50,947 --> 00:48:56,915
"The heart is in search of the light."

640
00:49:14,325 --> 00:49:20,278
"Thousands of butterflies
are in search of the light."

641
00:49:21,294 --> 00:49:27,801
"The waves in the ocean
are waiting for the light."

642
00:49:42,306 --> 00:49:47,801
"Each and every cloud
is waiting for the light."

643
00:49:48,082 --> 00:49:54,676
"Every leaf starts smiling
on the arrival of light."

644
00:49:54,893 --> 00:50:01,055
"The whole world is
waiting for the light."

645
00:50:01,931 --> 00:50:05,386
"We are waiting for the light."

646
00:50:05,466 --> 00:50:08,601
"The sky is filled with light."

647
00:50:08,926 --> 00:50:12,385
"The eyes are in search of light."

648
00:50:12,465 --> 00:50:15,676
"The heart is in search of the light."

649
00:50:15,881 --> 00:50:19,401
"We are waiting for the light."

650
00:50:19,481 --> 00:50:22,969
"The sky is filled with light."

651
00:50:23,049 --> 00:50:26,688
"The eyes are in search of light."

652
00:50:26,768 --> 00:50:29,795
"The heart is in search of the light."

653
00:50:30,947 --> 00:50:32,836
The exams are postponed again,
brother Ravi.

654
00:50:33,125 --> 00:50:35,655
I don't feel like touching
the books anymore.

655
00:51:32,444 --> 00:51:35,569
You're eating like a dog.
Don't you get food at home?

656
00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:49,127
Can you give me 10 paisa?
- Where's your sister?

657
00:51:49,207 --> 00:51:50,305
She is ill. She is sleeping.

658
00:51:50,878 --> 00:51:52,943
Give me 10 paisa. I am very hungry.

659
00:51:53,116 --> 00:51:54,835
What sort of people
are your parents!

660
00:51:55,019 --> 00:51:56,500
They let you leave the house
without feeding you anything?

661
00:51:56,673 --> 00:52:00,262
My mother and father are not with us.
- What are you saying!

662
00:52:00,446 --> 00:52:03,084
Where do you stay?
- In that broken house.

663
00:52:03,462 --> 00:52:05,150
Chunchuni and I live there.
- Come, son.

664
00:52:05,323 --> 00:52:07,377
Let me see your house.
- And also see if you can...

665
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:08,641
...feed them something.

666
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:14,122
His mother passed away
a long time ago.

667
00:52:14,489 --> 00:52:17,236
And his father is in the jail.
- But the neighbors...

668
00:52:17,409 --> 00:52:19,712
...can look after them, can't they?
- Neighbors?

669
00:52:20,307 --> 00:52:22,403
It seems that you are new here.
- Yes, son.

670
00:52:23,009 --> 00:52:24,457
That's the reason you are saying so.

671
00:52:39,563 --> 00:52:41,638
Did Tinku have milk?
- Yes, daughter-in-law.

672
00:52:41,718 --> 00:52:43,124
She had milk and went to bed.

673
00:52:43,707 --> 00:52:46,118
Who is he?
- A child from the neighborhood.

674
00:52:46,198 --> 00:52:48,202
He doesn't have his mother or father.
- What's he doing here?

675
00:52:48,734 --> 00:52:49,894
He was feeling very hungry.

676
00:52:49,974 --> 00:52:51,329
That's the reason I
gave him something to eat.

677
00:52:51,409 --> 00:52:53,347
With whose permission did
you let him enter the house?

678
00:52:53,427 --> 00:52:54,238
Permission?

679
00:52:54,318 --> 00:52:56,486
Yes, with whose permission did
you let him enter the house?

680
00:52:56,566 --> 00:52:58,982
What if he steals something?
Will you take his responsibility?

681
00:52:59,233 --> 00:53:01,233
Don't talk like that,
daughter-in-law.

682
00:53:01,406 --> 00:53:03,180
Don't talk about permissions
and all.

683
00:53:03,363 --> 00:53:05,461
I felt like bringing him here,
so I brought him here.

684
00:53:05,925 --> 00:53:07,581
And I didn't give him your food.

685
00:53:08,023 --> 00:53:10,118
I gave him something
to eat from my share.

686
00:53:10,368 --> 00:53:14,379
That's also our money.
- No. That's my salary.

687
00:53:15,319 --> 00:53:17,179
You are getting teary-eyed
and blunt.

688
00:53:17,259 --> 00:53:19,525
No, you are the ones who are
blunt and insensitive.

689
00:53:19,605 --> 00:53:21,331
You are liars, you are fraudsters...

690
00:53:21,514 --> 00:53:23,827
You sweet-talked me
and brought me here...

691
00:53:24,008 --> 00:53:27,492
...for your selfish reasons.
You are unethical people.

692
00:53:27,968 --> 00:53:30,143
You are dishonest people.
You are corrupt people.

693
00:53:30,223 --> 00:53:31,506
Hey, get up! You need not eat here.

694
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:35,925
I will come back to take my
clothes and belongings.

695
00:53:39,557 --> 00:53:42,336
You bring people and they insult
us and abandon us in this way!

696
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,147
My responsibility is to
bring people here...

697
00:53:44,227 --> 00:53:45,153
...and your responsibility
is to keep them here.

698
00:53:45,406 --> 00:53:47,394
To hell with people like you.

699
00:53:47,816 --> 00:53:51,989
We can't work at your home
at the cost of our self-esteem.

700
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:53,891
You unethical fellow.

701
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:57,514
And you are showing me money.

702
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:03,071
With what your uncle has left for me
I can feed you all your life.

703
00:54:04,023 --> 00:54:08,218
You are immoral people.
You are showing me money.

704
00:54:08,683 --> 00:54:10,226
Why did you bring me here?

705
00:54:11,050 --> 00:54:13,169
Did I ask you to bring me here?

706
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:17,234
Where will I go now?
Where will I go?

707
00:54:20,532 --> 00:54:21,736
Will you come to our place?

708
00:54:23,451 --> 00:54:27,075
Your place? Let's go. Let's go.

709
00:54:55,294 --> 00:54:57,107
What's the matter you are ill?

710
00:54:57,786 --> 00:54:58,773
Let me check your temperature.

711
00:55:04,122 --> 00:55:05,739
Your body temperature
is not too high.

712
00:55:05,819 --> 00:55:12,133
I am hungry. - Oh God!
How'll the kids survive in this way!

713
00:55:13,257 --> 00:55:16,198
Take this. Take this one rupee...

714
00:55:16,632 --> 00:55:18,857
Bring something to eat for today.

715
00:55:19,873 --> 00:55:21,830
Tomorrow when I will bring
my box and belongings...

716
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,733
Here is your box and belongings...

717
00:55:25,528 --> 00:55:27,517
You fought with them
and left that house...

718
00:55:29,149 --> 00:55:31,041
So I brought your belongings.

719
00:55:35,393 --> 00:55:36,620
And they gave you my belongings?

720
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:38,566
Yes, people don't trouble
me that much.

721
00:55:38,896 --> 00:55:39,954
They give me whatever
I request them for.

722
00:55:40,619 --> 00:55:41,856
So, Chunchuni...

723
00:55:44,068 --> 00:55:46,329
Who are you, son?
- I live in this locality itself.

724
00:55:47,581 --> 00:55:50,705
Come, Tuntun,
let's go to the market...

725
00:55:50,922 --> 00:55:52,367
...and bring rice and vegetables.

726
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:56,934
You cook something,
so that they could eat.

727
00:55:58,382 --> 00:56:01,150
What do you do, son?
- Me?

728
00:56:04,696 --> 00:56:07,915
I don't do anything.
I don't do any work.

729
00:56:10,123 --> 00:56:11,474
I am the muscleman of this locality.

730
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:13,096
I show off my muscles.

731
00:56:13,799 --> 00:56:15,733
I have seen you on the streets
a number of times.

732
00:56:16,047 --> 00:56:17,830
Why don't you stay
at your home, son?

733
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:19,933
You can help your parents
if you stay at home.

734
00:56:22,555 --> 00:56:24,512
I am of nobody's help, granny.

735
00:56:29,342 --> 00:56:30,400
Granny?

736
00:56:33,463 --> 00:56:35,705
I go home only twice a day,
for eating and sleeping.

737
00:56:36,328 --> 00:56:37,842
Once in the morning and
once in the evening.

738
00:56:39,139 --> 00:56:40,043
Come, Tuntun.

739
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:45,755
Mister, take what you are getting.

740
00:56:45,835 --> 00:56:46,998
You won't get even that later on.

741
00:56:47,078 --> 00:56:52,030
Mr. Nitish, give Tuntun 200 gm
rice and 200 gm pulses.

742
00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:54,497
Sit there.
- Mister...

743
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:57,832
...how can I give you rice during
this time when there is not supply?

744
00:56:58,048 --> 00:56:59,853
A number of people don't take
their ration. Give him from their quota.

745
00:57:00,329 --> 00:57:01,561
It's a matter of just 200 gm.

746
00:57:01,983 --> 00:57:04,112
Does anyone leave their ration
at this time, mister?

747
00:57:04,969 --> 00:57:07,030
Yes, they do,
and you sell that in black.

748
00:57:07,110 --> 00:57:09,192
Why would I object you when
you're requesting me so much!

749
00:57:09,272 --> 00:57:11,253
Sit down.

750
00:57:14,021 --> 00:57:18,395
So mister, the election is nearing.
What do you think will happen?

751
00:57:18,681 --> 00:57:21,719
Chandu, bring two teas, and listen...

752
00:57:21,946 --> 00:57:24,703
...pack some sugar as
well for Mr. Ravi.

753
00:57:25,719 --> 00:57:26,714
Will you take a toffee?

754
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:31,168
Kid, you too take it.

755
00:57:31,946 --> 00:57:34,551
I like toffees a lot.

756
00:57:35,070 --> 00:57:39,092
And mister, going by what the
newspapers are writing...

757
00:57:39,438 --> 00:57:42,115
...I fear there might be bloodshed
during elections.

758
00:57:42,195 --> 00:57:44,768
I don't know. I don't understand
these newspapers.

759
00:57:46,573 --> 00:57:50,773
Mister, you're the kingmakers.
- You are flattering me?

760
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:52,238
No.
- Nitish.

761
00:57:56,925 --> 00:57:59,655
Send a tin full of kerosene.
There's a feast at our place.

762
00:57:59,735 --> 00:58:02,557
Kerosene? - Yes, didn't you
get it or do you want me to...

763
00:58:03,266 --> 00:58:04,941
...light it and show you what I want.

764
00:58:05,136 --> 00:58:07,755
You are very rustic, mister.

765
00:58:07,926 --> 00:58:10,691
Ok, you may go now. I will send it.
- No.

766
00:58:15,137 --> 00:58:17,568
If this locality's ration goes to
other locality I will kill you.

767
00:58:17,904 --> 00:58:19,672
Mister, can you tell me
which side I should take?

768
00:58:19,912 --> 00:58:21,667
Both of you are present here.

769
00:58:21,861 --> 00:58:24,580
You decide it and tell me.
It would be a great favor on me.

770
00:58:24,942 --> 00:58:26,217
It's your problem. You solve it.

771
00:58:46,724 --> 00:58:49,134
So is your stomach full now?

772
00:58:50,648 --> 00:58:52,507
Now go to bed.
- Won't you eat?

773
00:58:53,534 --> 00:58:55,805
No.
- Why? I have got some bananas.

774
00:58:56,659 --> 00:58:59,811
Bananas.
- Bananas? Who gave you bananas?

775
00:58:59,891 --> 00:59:01,988
Brother Ravi gave me bananas.
- Ravi?

776
00:59:02,658 --> 00:59:06,161
Brother Ravi who brought
your belongings here.

777
00:59:58,888 --> 01:00:01,439
What are you doing here
in this broken house?

778
01:00:01,699 --> 01:00:03,072
Please come, granny. Please come.

779
01:00:05,126 --> 01:00:08,899
Please come.
We are playing cards. Sit down.

780
01:00:12,577 --> 01:00:13,635
Did you finish your meals?

781
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:17,114
Why did you bring fruits for me?

782
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:19,882
How can you fast!

783
01:00:21,136 --> 01:00:23,078
And also Tuntun and
Chunchuni are Brahmins.

784
01:00:23,492 --> 01:00:24,608
You couldn't eat with them.

785
01:00:25,665 --> 01:00:28,077
Wow! You are pretty smart.

786
01:00:29,643 --> 01:00:31,697
What did I say so funny?

787
01:00:34,767 --> 01:00:36,886
Why are you playing
cards with money?

788
01:00:37,427 --> 01:00:39,652
This is called poker.
We play it with money.

789
01:00:40,324 --> 01:00:43,520
Is that so! It's great.

790
01:00:44,075 --> 01:00:47,004
Yes, watch how I win.
Brother Ravi, blind pass.

791
01:00:47,242 --> 01:00:49,476
You are losing all your money.
- Let the game be over.

792
01:00:49,556 --> 01:00:50,907
Then you can count.

793
01:00:51,794 --> 01:00:57,134
Seen, 20.
- What's this! You play with money?

794
01:00:57,891 --> 01:00:59,242
Then this is called gambling.

795
01:01:02,182 --> 01:01:05,307
You got it right, granny.
We are gamblers.

796
01:01:05,976 --> 01:01:08,213
We are not good fellows, granny.

797
01:01:10,629 --> 01:01:12,583
We are not too famous
in our locality.

798
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:15,515
Everyone calls us boys
of Ravi's gang.

799
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:17,833
Some people call us dacoits.

800
01:01:18,326 --> 01:01:19,770
But that's not true, granny.

801
01:01:20,461 --> 01:01:22,861
We were never into thefts
and robberies. I am off.

802
01:01:23,628 --> 01:01:25,816
But if someone comes to our locality
and tries to show off...

803
01:01:26,274 --> 01:01:28,065
...his power we can't
stay silent, can we?

804
01:01:28,843 --> 01:01:32,130
Then we have use some
'small wonders'... Off!

805
01:01:32,374 --> 01:01:34,310
Small wonders? What small wonders?

806
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:37,978
You are so old, but still
you don't know about small wonders?

807
01:01:38,531 --> 01:01:39,573
Wait a minute.
I'll show you.

808
01:01:52,691 --> 01:01:54,670
These are 'small wonders'. Bombs.

809
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:56,621
They are homemade,
with brother Ravi's formula.

810
01:01:56,944 --> 01:02:00,563
One bomb can knock down ten people.
- At once.

811
01:02:00,699 --> 01:02:02,755
Keep it away. Keep it away.

812
01:02:02,835 --> 01:02:05,143
You are kids.
You shouldn't touch them.

813
01:02:06,414 --> 01:02:10,376
And brother, don't you study?
- Yes, of course, we do.

814
01:02:12,572 --> 01:02:14,026
Brother Ravi studied up to BA.

815
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:16,689
Then he went to jail and
his studies discontinued.

816
01:02:17,286 --> 01:02:18,488
What are you saying!

817
01:02:20,511 --> 01:02:22,911
I'm off. Let's stop it here.

818
01:02:23,625 --> 01:02:25,424
Now we shall chat with granny.

819
01:02:26,393 --> 01:02:28,131
Granny, all of them
study in college.

820
01:02:29,238 --> 01:02:30,889
But these days studies don't
take place in colleges.

821
01:02:31,994 --> 01:02:36,442
Students prepare for exams
and exams are postponed.

822
01:02:37,393 --> 01:02:38,981
After a couple of postponements...

823
01:02:39,061 --> 01:02:40,995
...when the exams finally
take place...

824
01:02:41,554 --> 01:02:44,932
...there are fights and chaos
in the examination halls.

825
01:02:45,012 --> 01:02:47,920
I bashed up a professor last time.

826
01:02:48,456 --> 01:02:50,973
He was saying that we create
a scene and shout...

827
01:02:51,259 --> 01:02:52,596
...that the question paper is tough...

828
01:02:52,676 --> 01:02:54,316
...and that we don't let the
examination take place.

829
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:55,991
We can't go to the college
and here at home...

830
01:02:56,071 --> 01:02:58,320
...parents harass us day and
night with their taunts...

831
01:02:58,715 --> 01:02:59,900
...as if we are responsible
for everything.

832
01:03:00,497 --> 01:03:01,689
We are also fed up of everything.

833
01:03:01,769 --> 01:03:03,542
We go home twice a
day to have meals...

834
01:03:03,793 --> 01:03:05,228
...and after that we don't
have any contact with home.

835
01:03:07,762 --> 01:03:12,346
Your words reminded me of
an incident of my past.

836
01:03:12,917 --> 01:03:15,330
You said that people
call you dacoits.

837
01:03:16,033 --> 01:03:18,614
Once I too saw a dacoit.
- Is that so!

838
01:03:18,694 --> 01:03:19,669
What sort of dacoit, granny?

839
01:03:19,749 --> 01:03:21,513
Did he commit a murder?
Was he caught?

840
01:03:23,389 --> 01:03:25,543
He was a cute guy like you.

841
01:03:32,855 --> 01:03:36,043
Open the door. Open the door,
Mr. Nepu. Open the door.

842
01:03:36,467 --> 01:03:38,681
In my house? Oh God!

843
01:03:38,854 --> 01:03:40,516
Open the door fast.
The person who entered...

844
01:03:40,596 --> 01:03:41,578
...your house is an
anti-social person.

845
01:03:41,658 --> 01:03:43,688
He's got a revolver in his hand.
- Oh no!

846
01:03:43,853 --> 01:03:46,940
Wait a minute. I'm coming.
What sort of a trouble is this!

847
01:04:06,204 --> 01:04:07,859
Come in.
Let's check inside your house.

848
01:04:07,939 --> 01:04:09,012
We saw him coming here.

849
01:04:09,092 --> 01:04:11,320
How can he enter our house?
- Not just the doors, but even...

850
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:13,725
...the iron shackles can't stop
the dacoit who came here.

851
01:04:13,976 --> 01:04:17,107
Maruti, you stay here.
Come, let's check upstairs.

852
01:04:48,702 --> 01:04:49,760
What are you doing outside?

853
01:04:50,164 --> 01:04:52,153
You heard that he's a
dangerous dacoit. Go.

854
01:04:52,464 --> 01:04:55,829
Go to the bedroom.
- Where did he disappear?

855
01:04:56,682 --> 01:04:59,539
And what's in that room?
- It's our bedroom.

856
01:04:59,919 --> 01:05:01,474
Do you want to check it?
- No, it's alright.

857
01:05:01,995 --> 01:05:04,824
I am warning all of you that he's
quite a dangerous person.

858
01:05:05,066 --> 01:05:06,095
Be alert.

859
01:05:15,239 --> 01:05:17,036
What a problem!

860
01:05:26,419 --> 01:05:28,166
Brother, come out.

861
01:05:35,833 --> 01:05:36,891
Thanks for saving me.

862
01:05:38,008 --> 01:05:39,711
I will always remember you.

863
01:05:41,528 --> 01:05:42,704
Go, bring it.

864
01:05:53,439 --> 01:05:55,031
We packed some mudi for you.

865
01:05:56,732 --> 01:05:58,434
Wow! I really needed it.

866
01:05:59,404 --> 01:06:00,835
I didn't eat anything
since last night.

867
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:04,672
They are chasing me like a dog.

868
01:06:08,729 --> 01:06:11,927
Brother, there's a...
There's a small request.

869
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:15,041
Will you please show me your pistol?

870
01:06:16,009 --> 01:06:17,203
Who told you that I have got a pistol?

871
01:06:17,653 --> 01:06:20,887
I know that you people carry
a pistol all the times.

872
01:06:27,748 --> 01:06:28,806
And these are the bullets.

873
01:06:31,419 --> 01:06:32,477
Ok, I will have to go now.

874
01:06:34,689 --> 01:06:36,418
Come, I shall show you the path.
- Yes.

875
01:06:36,923 --> 01:06:38,929
After our mango garden there's
a big open ground.

876
01:06:39,569 --> 01:06:41,028
From there where do you want to go?

877
01:06:41,108 --> 01:06:42,561
I'll be out of danger once
I cross that ground.

878
01:06:42,838 --> 01:06:46,421
They tied this woman around
my neck and ruined my life.

879
01:06:47,059 --> 01:06:49,781
Or else I wish I could register
my name in your gang...

880
01:06:49,861 --> 01:06:51,355
...and work like you people.
- You need not register...

881
01:06:51,435 --> 01:06:53,050
...your name in our gang
to work like us...

882
01:06:53,130 --> 01:06:54,521
You can also work from the
confines of your home.

883
01:06:54,601 --> 01:06:58,665
What can I do from home?
- Yes, you can.

884
01:06:59,671 --> 01:07:02,254
First of all let our
country get freedom.

885
01:07:02,972 --> 01:07:04,589
Then a number of things
will be possible.

886
01:07:26,193 --> 01:07:28,986
Don't prepare meals today.
I won't eat anything today.

887
01:07:29,566 --> 01:07:32,870
Why? Will you go to have a
drink somewhere? - No. No.

888
01:07:33,769 --> 01:07:36,242
The brother whom police
was chasing that day...

889
01:07:36,744 --> 01:07:38,673
...has died today.

890
01:07:40,374 --> 01:07:42,365
Brother was fighting alone
with the Britishers.

891
01:07:44,623 --> 01:07:45,770
He was shot dead.

892
01:07:55,053 --> 01:07:56,645
He was a native dacoit.

893
01:07:58,211 --> 01:08:00,183
He was also as cute as you are.

894
01:08:01,938 --> 01:08:05,549
He too used to talk as
sweetly as you talk.

895
01:08:06,137 --> 01:08:07,633
He was also a bit spoilt like you.

896
01:08:13,195 --> 01:08:14,321
Now you guys go home.

897
01:08:15,366 --> 01:08:16,322
It's too late at night.

898
01:08:20,606 --> 01:08:23,867
Granny talks so well. Right, Manu?
- Yes.

899
01:08:24,135 --> 01:08:25,861
Just like people talk in movies.

900
01:08:26,548 --> 01:08:30,404
"O my beloved one..."

901
01:08:30,484 --> 01:08:33,476
"Your dreams and my dreams..."

902
01:08:33,718 --> 01:08:35,248
"...are in the same color now."

903
01:08:35,328 --> 01:08:37,083
Won't you go home?

904
01:08:38,439 --> 01:08:41,423
I don't even know your name.
- Ravi.

905
01:08:42,392 --> 01:08:44,406
I spend most of the
nights here, granny.

906
01:08:45,432 --> 01:08:46,906
Chunchuni gets scared.
That's the reason...

907
01:08:47,580 --> 01:08:50,023
I am here now. You may go.

908
01:08:50,518 --> 01:08:51,849
Go home, or else your parents
will be worried about you.

909
01:08:52,216 --> 01:08:53,738
No, no one will be worried about me.

910
01:08:54,093 --> 01:08:56,929
What are you saying!
Is that possible!

911
01:09:01,251 --> 01:09:04,461
Let's go, granny.
Let's go back to your village...

912
01:09:04,541 --> 01:09:06,255
...with Tuntun and Chunchuni.
- Will you come?

913
01:09:06,928 --> 01:09:09,780
Let's go, dear.
I have some land as well.

914
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:11,518
I have two large mango gardens.

915
01:09:11,598 --> 01:09:16,119
I have one dog as well.
I can't spend all that money alone.

916
01:09:16,935 --> 01:09:17,993
That's why come with me, brother.

917
01:09:18,716 --> 01:09:21,458
It will be really great.
It's a far better place than Kolkatta.

918
01:09:43,783 --> 01:09:46,426
Brother, you didn't say anything?

919
01:09:46,841 --> 01:09:47,931
Won't you come to our village?

920
01:09:48,588 --> 01:09:51,165
No, that's not the thing,
granny. I will come.

921
01:09:52,272 --> 01:09:53,379
I will have to live there itself.

922
01:09:55,221 --> 01:09:59,450
There's some pain hidden in
your heart. Am I right?

923
01:10:02,807 --> 01:10:05,635
I am like your mother.

924
01:10:06,318 --> 01:10:08,567
You can't hide anything from me.

925
01:10:10,210 --> 01:10:11,585
I don't have a mother, granny.

926
01:10:12,779 --> 01:10:16,275
She passed away long time ago.
I was four year old then.

927
01:10:17,587 --> 01:10:20,010
So that's the reason... I was right.

928
01:10:20,598 --> 01:10:23,086
That's the reason you
always look dull.

929
01:10:23,348 --> 01:10:25,757
No, granny. That's not the reason.

930
01:10:26,592 --> 01:10:28,157
I don't even miss my mother.

931
01:10:31,426 --> 01:10:34,621
Granny, how can one simple
mistake of a person...

932
01:10:34,701 --> 01:10:36,659
...ruin his entire life!

933
01:11:34,561 --> 01:11:35,928
So you trapped a chick here?

934
01:11:36,092 --> 01:11:38,285
That's not the language you
use for well-reputed people.

935
01:11:38,514 --> 01:11:39,722
Don't lecture me. Had I studied
in college like you do...

936
01:11:39,802 --> 01:11:41,368
...I would've also talked like you.

937
01:11:47,828 --> 01:11:50,228
Tell me how you got her.
- She lives next-door to us.

938
01:11:50,838 --> 01:11:52,706
You are a pretty smart guy.

939
01:12:18,470 --> 01:12:19,785
You dance pretty well.

940
01:12:21,964 --> 01:12:23,562
You are good at many things.

941
01:12:24,030 --> 01:12:26,089
The exams are nearing.
So I'm flattering Mother Saraswati.

942
01:12:26,816 --> 01:12:29,492
No matter wherever Saraswati is,
She is not with you for sure.

943
01:12:30,379 --> 01:12:31,295
Where are you going now?

944
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:33,825
My head started aching after
watching your dance.

945
01:12:33,905 --> 01:12:35,652
I am just going out to
get some fresh air.

946
01:12:36,162 --> 01:12:38,056
If you wish I can come with you.

947
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:51,626
Do you know we are leaving Kolkatta?
- When?

948
01:12:51,937 --> 01:12:52,914
Next month.

949
01:12:54,523 --> 01:12:57,688
Why?
- Father is getting transferred to Nasik.

950
01:13:02,405 --> 01:13:04,930
Why don't you come to Nasik
after your exams are over?

951
01:13:05,627 --> 01:13:06,803
No.
- Why?

952
01:13:07,902 --> 01:13:11,136
What's the use?
- It will make me happy.

953
01:13:15,444 --> 01:13:18,813
Really. I will be waiting for you.

954
01:13:20,278 --> 01:13:21,238
I will try.

955
01:13:22,233 --> 01:13:23,521
Let the exams be over first.

956
01:13:29,515 --> 01:13:31,461
I will find myself alone
after you leave.

957
01:13:31,541 --> 01:13:34,168
I don't believe you.
- What?

958
01:13:34,574 --> 01:13:36,429
That you would be alone
after we leave.

959
01:13:37,106 --> 01:13:38,708
We moved into this place
six months ago...

960
01:13:38,864 --> 01:13:40,810
...but you didn't come to
meet my father even once.

961
01:13:41,251 --> 01:13:43,465
Oh God! Your father
is such an angry man.

962
01:13:43,768 --> 01:13:45,353
He scares the hell out of me.
- Great.

963
01:13:45,740 --> 01:13:47,123
You are enjoying here
alone in the dark?

964
01:13:47,694 --> 01:13:49,381
Shut up! Get lost from here.
- Oh God!

965
01:13:49,580 --> 01:13:50,923
You are having a good time alone.

966
01:13:51,003 --> 01:13:52,129
Think about your friend as well.

967
01:13:53,506 --> 01:13:54,916
Such type of guys are your friends?

968
01:13:54,996 --> 01:13:56,187
No, he's not my friend
in any which way.

969
01:13:56,267 --> 01:13:58,939
He's lying. I am his
childhood friend.

970
01:13:59,664 --> 01:14:00,937
Won't you show some
mercy towards me?

971
01:14:01,913 --> 01:14:05,191
Alpona. Alpona.

972
01:14:05,779 --> 01:14:07,664
Don't try to contact me ever again.

973
01:14:12,097 --> 01:14:13,223
She's not worth it, buddy.

974
01:16:00,601 --> 01:16:02,365
Who's that? Who are you?

975
01:16:02,910 --> 01:16:04,112
Stop! Don't run!

976
01:16:04,639 --> 01:16:07,182
What are you doing here.

977
01:16:07,262 --> 01:16:13,334
Sunil! Manik!

978
01:16:13,578 --> 01:16:16,064
He was trying to
enter her bedroom. Scoundrel.

979
01:16:16,514 --> 01:16:17,985
He's Ravi who lives next door.

980
01:16:18,203 --> 01:16:20,045
Scoundrel!

981
01:16:20,338 --> 01:16:23,184
What is he doing here?
He was knocking at she's room.

982
01:16:23,495 --> 01:16:26,937
You are nice guy? I will not spare you.

983
01:16:30,354 --> 01:16:32,819
I will teach you lesson.

984
01:16:32,899 --> 01:16:35,266
I will show you.

985
01:16:36,355 --> 01:16:38,422
Hand him over to the police.

986
01:16:40,887 --> 01:16:41,916
I was in prison for fifteen days.

987
01:16:44,779 --> 01:16:46,275
Oh God!

988
01:16:47,902 --> 01:16:49,268
I left my education.

989
01:16:49,666 --> 01:16:50,989
Father stopped speaking to me.

990
01:16:53,627 --> 01:16:55,348
Chenu made his gang to take revenge.

991
01:16:55,428 --> 01:16:57,190
I made my gang.

992
01:16:59,517 --> 01:17:02,536
Initially, people hated me.
They taunted me.

993
01:17:04,784 --> 01:17:05,926
They scared now.

994
01:17:08,103 --> 01:17:10,899
If you are silent in this world
you will be suppressed.

995
01:17:11,851 --> 01:17:14,101
Raise your head and
walk with a swagger...

996
01:17:14,454 --> 01:17:16,244
...and everyone will bow
down in front of you.

997
01:17:16,478 --> 01:17:22,731
India's heritage, India's history,
India's dharma...

998
01:17:23,112 --> 01:17:26,917
...India's literature,
India's music...

999
01:17:27,289 --> 01:17:32,011
...and India's financial situation
will have to be reincarnated...

1000
01:17:32,210 --> 01:17:33,719
...on the world stage.

1001
01:17:34,468 --> 01:17:37,326
For the men and women of India...

1002
01:17:37,666 --> 01:17:40,658
...for the poor workers of India...

1003
01:17:40,998 --> 01:17:44,134
...for the farmers of India...

1004
01:17:44,561 --> 01:17:48,946
...for India's culture
and traditions...

1005
01:17:49,214 --> 01:17:54,706
...for removing the sorrows of
fathers and mothers of India...

1006
01:17:54,887 --> 01:17:57,292
...I came in front of you again.

1007
01:17:57,560 --> 01:18:02,674
I will dedicate my life,
I will sacrifice my life if required...

1008
01:18:02,754 --> 01:18:04,302
...to serve you all...

1009
01:18:09,318 --> 01:18:13,716
I will dedicate my life,
I will sacrifice my life if required...

1010
01:18:14,023 --> 01:18:16,799
Ravi.
- Tuntun.

1011
01:18:19,512 --> 01:18:25,705
With your help, with your backing,
with your support...

1012
01:18:25,785 --> 01:18:30,029
...if could be able to turn our
unfortunate mother Bengal...

1013
01:18:30,109 --> 01:18:32,778
...into a flourishing
and a prosperous...

1014
01:18:32,858 --> 01:18:34,450
Raise your sleeve.
Be a bit dramatic here.

1015
01:18:36,061 --> 01:18:39,792
Bengal is in such a pathetic state...

1016
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:43,281
Who will transform it?
Who will support it?

1017
01:18:43,361 --> 01:18:46,264
Who will bring the ray
of hope? I will.

1018
01:18:46,344 --> 01:18:51,009
I'll bring that ray of hope.
With my service, with my action...

1019
01:18:51,089 --> 01:18:54,544
...with my love I will be your
voice again and say...

1020
01:19:09,096 --> 01:19:10,443
We'll have to stop the meetings...

1021
01:19:10,523 --> 01:19:11,830
...of the young guys over here.

1022
01:19:12,287 --> 01:19:19,941
And listen to me here... You are
eating some nice dishes over here...

1023
01:19:20,148 --> 01:19:22,501
...and this kid is dying with hunger.

1024
01:19:23,409 --> 01:19:24,602
Ravi's grandmother.

1025
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:31,078
Take it.
What's there to feel ashamed of?

1026
01:19:31,158 --> 01:19:31,928
You are hungry, aren't you?

1027
01:19:32,008 --> 01:19:33,139
You don't want to stay
hungry, do you? Go.

1028
01:19:34,021 --> 01:19:35,579
God bless you, son. God bless you.

1029
01:19:35,659 --> 01:19:38,787
Mister, give me half kg groundnuts.

1030
01:19:39,193 --> 01:19:41,217
Use the term 'kilo', granny.
Use the term 'kilo'.

1031
01:19:41,297 --> 01:19:43,798
No one says kg these days.
- How does it matter!

1032
01:19:43,933 --> 01:19:46,302
It's one and the same.
Give me the grams.

1033
01:19:46,467 --> 01:19:50,603
Ravi wants to eat ghughni.
- For whom? For Mr. Ravi?

1034
01:19:50,683 --> 01:19:52,000
Take it. Take it.

1035
01:19:52,174 --> 01:19:55,945
Give her 500 gm grams.
- I will pay the money later on.

1036
01:19:56,179 --> 01:19:57,978
In a couple of days Ravi
will go to our village...

1037
01:19:58,058 --> 01:19:59,940
...and sell the harvest and bring
the money, then I will pay you.

1038
01:20:00,114 --> 01:20:01,956
As you wish, granny. As you wish.

1039
01:20:03,453 --> 01:20:05,874
Granny, let me pack some oil as well.

1040
01:20:05,954 --> 01:20:07,266
You will need some oil with ghughni.

1041
01:20:07,491 --> 01:20:09,394
That would be even better, son.

1042
01:20:09,474 --> 01:20:11,884
Give her 100 gm oil as well.

1043
01:20:12,991 --> 01:20:16,943
Give her oil. Give oil for Mr. Ravi.

1044
01:20:24,944 --> 01:20:30,530
5. Blind 5.
- Take this. Share it among you.

1045
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:34,431
Great, granny. Great.

1046
01:20:37,264 --> 01:20:40,044
Granny, I brought some milk
and snacks for you.

1047
01:20:45,806 --> 01:20:47,958
Why do you bring something
or other for me everyday?

1048
01:20:48,475 --> 01:20:49,737
I like it.

1049
01:20:51,831 --> 01:20:54,806
It's really great.
- Great taste.

1050
01:20:56,605 --> 01:20:59,606
One has to be very fortunate
to get kids like you.

1051
01:21:00,367 --> 01:21:02,813
Like that story...

1052
01:21:03,109 --> 01:21:05,115
I heard these from your grandpa.

1053
01:21:05,547 --> 01:21:06,966
How else would I know them?

1054
01:21:07,046 --> 01:21:07,909
I am an illiterate.

1055
01:21:08,350 --> 01:21:10,296
I am talking about that story.

1056
01:21:11,464 --> 01:21:15,104
The child asks his mother
where she got him.

1057
01:21:16,324 --> 01:21:21,012
Mother says... Oh God!
You were hidden in my heart.

1058
01:21:22,085 --> 01:21:24,360
Granny, that's not a story.
It's a poem.

1059
01:21:24,696 --> 01:21:28,078
Ravindranath's poem.
Child looks at the mother...

1060
01:21:28,519 --> 01:21:30,171
...and asks where you brought
me from, mother?

1061
01:21:30,339 --> 01:21:32,273
Where did you bring me from?

1062
01:21:32,705 --> 01:21:36,433
Mother laughs on hearing that
and hugs the child and says...

1063
01:21:36,883 --> 01:21:38,275
...you were in my heart.

1064
01:21:49,319 --> 01:21:53,958
Really, son.
When I see at your angelic faces...

1065
01:21:54,569 --> 01:21:59,360
...I wish I had children like you.

1066
01:22:09,116 --> 01:22:11,642
Granny says everything
so beautifully.

1067
01:22:12,289 --> 01:22:14,178
Even the biggest orators are
nothing compared to her.

1068
01:22:15,074 --> 01:22:18,983
The ghugni's great, isn't it?
Tart and spicy.

1069
01:22:20,133 --> 01:22:22,985
Granny, please make pinyagi
(onion fries) for us some time.

1070
01:22:23,065 --> 01:22:23,930
Shut up!

1071
01:22:24,181 --> 01:22:26,056
How do you expect a lady of
her caste to touch onions?

1072
01:22:26,435 --> 01:22:29,374
My aunt should've heard you.
She would've given you an earful.

1073
01:22:29,454 --> 01:22:30,531
It's alright.

1074
01:22:31,019 --> 01:22:32,775
I will prepare whatever
you want to eat.

1075
01:22:32,855 --> 01:22:34,327
Three cheers for granny.

1076
01:22:35,102 --> 01:22:38,613
"O my beloved one..."

1077
01:22:38,693 --> 01:22:40,405
"Your dreams and my dreams..."

1078
01:22:40,732 --> 01:22:43,681
Oh God! What's that song! Tedemede!

1079
01:22:43,761 --> 01:22:44,658
This is hindi song.

1080
01:22:44,909 --> 01:22:46,906
No, I don't like those songs.

1081
01:22:48,316 --> 01:22:49,968
Your grandpa also used to
sing such beautiful songs.

1082
01:22:50,218 --> 01:22:56,211
"When your beloved one looks at you..."

1083
01:22:56,410 --> 01:22:58,771
"...the world looks beautiful."

1084
01:22:58,953 --> 01:23:04,315
"When your beloved one looks at you..."

1085
01:23:04,774 --> 01:23:07,224
"...the world looks beautiful."

1086
01:23:07,403 --> 01:23:15,602
"Love has made many people famous."

1087
01:23:15,757 --> 01:23:19,639
"Many people famous."

1088
01:23:22,050 --> 01:23:30,297
"You look at me and blush."

1089
01:23:30,721 --> 01:23:39,040
"You look at me and blush."

1090
01:23:39,213 --> 01:23:47,300
"Love has made many people famous."

1091
01:23:47,490 --> 01:23:51,486
"Many people famous."

1092
01:23:57,242 --> 01:24:05,723
"On these wild paths
hearts just wander."

1093
01:24:07,729 --> 01:24:16,473
"On these wild paths
hearts just wander."

1094
01:24:18,592 --> 01:24:26,904
"Flowers blossom in the garden
and there's a carnival in the sky."

1095
01:24:29,013 --> 01:24:37,534
"Waking awake all night came to an end."

1096
01:24:41,650 --> 01:24:45,341
"Look at me, O blushing wife...

1097
01:24:45,421 --> 01:24:49,359
...you blush and cover
your face with the veil."

1098
01:24:49,733 --> 01:24:53,956
"Look at me, O blushing wife,
you blush...

1099
01:24:54,036 --> 01:24:57,971
...and cover your
face with the veil."

1100
01:24:58,247 --> 01:25:07,302
"Love has made many people famous."

1101
01:25:07,527 --> 01:25:12,264
"Many people famous."

1102
01:25:12,344 --> 01:25:14,634
Wow!
- Great.

1103
01:25:16,461 --> 01:25:18,926
Unique, granny.
- Great.

1104
01:25:21,047 --> 01:25:24,322
Our granny is a versatile
genius I swear.

1105
01:25:26,821 --> 01:25:29,587
And yes, take me to
your home some day.

1106
01:25:29,951 --> 01:25:32,900
Introduce me to your parents once.
- No, granny.

1107
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:37,256
There's no fun in going home.
My father is always moody.

1108
01:25:37,553 --> 01:25:39,593
And my mother's has got
such a suspicious nature...

1109
01:25:39,785 --> 01:25:41,600
As if everyone in this
world is a thief.

1110
01:25:43,328 --> 01:25:45,045
Who's that?
- Is Ravi there? Ravi.

1111
01:25:45,218 --> 01:25:47,423
Please come in, sir.
Please come in. Bhanu Ghoshal.

1112
01:25:47,898 --> 01:25:50,298
I shall go now. I need to see the kids.

1113
01:25:50,934 --> 01:25:52,956
I have been searching you till
now all over the places.

1114
01:25:53,036 --> 01:25:54,774
I asked your father and he said
that he doesn't know where you went.

1115
01:25:55,293 --> 01:25:56,669
You will find us here at evenings.

1116
01:25:57,088 --> 01:26:00,636
Here? No. No.
Is this a place to stay?

1117
01:26:00,877 --> 01:26:02,764
A broken house, with all the...

1118
01:26:03,910 --> 01:26:06,436
If I return to power I will raise
a new building for you over here.

1119
01:26:07,002 --> 01:26:09,691
There you will have a library,
there will be a stage...

1120
01:26:09,771 --> 01:26:11,771
You don't mean what you say.

1121
01:26:11,851 --> 01:26:14,338
Once you get elected you
forget everything. - Yes.

1122
01:26:14,759 --> 01:26:17,287
Last time Mr. Amol said...
You need not worry at all.

1123
01:26:17,505 --> 01:26:21,667
I will tell the police not to
interfere in your matters.

1124
01:26:22,175 --> 01:26:24,246
And see the irony, when there
was a fight in the college...

1125
01:26:24,326 --> 01:26:26,294
...the police came and I was
the first person they held.

1126
01:26:26,986 --> 01:26:30,337
I took Mr. Amol's name...
And you won't believe what he said...

1127
01:26:30,510 --> 01:26:32,289
Don't threaten the police
of these Amols.

1128
01:26:32,369 --> 01:26:34,650
Don't associate my name with Amol.

1129
01:26:35,894 --> 01:26:38,711
I am giving you my assurance that
if the present police officer...

1130
01:26:38,791 --> 01:26:40,618
...says anything to you,
then just seven days...

1131
01:26:40,698 --> 01:26:42,898
Within seven days he will be
transferred.

1132
01:26:43,063 --> 01:26:46,430
"Your sorrows are mine now..."

1133
01:26:46,973 --> 01:26:51,999
"My happiness is yours now." Rafi.
- Yes, Rafi.

1134
01:26:52,421 --> 01:26:55,308
Bring him here.
Organize a big function.

1135
01:26:55,388 --> 01:26:56,962
Give them happy moment.

1136
01:26:57,686 --> 01:27:00,011
Create the nuisance.
I will give you money.

1137
01:27:01,178 --> 01:27:03,880
But the bird in the cage...
mine... that should win!

1138
01:27:04,195 --> 01:27:06,206
Your symbol is very apt.

1139
01:27:08,086 --> 01:27:11,887
I am giving you a jeep.
It will have tank-full petrol.

1140
01:27:11,967 --> 01:27:14,097
And you go out for the vote-canvas.

1141
01:27:14,177 --> 01:27:17,308
And I am giving you 500
rupees for expenses.

1142
01:27:18,540 --> 01:27:22,540
Oh God! Does anyone give such
a big amount to kids!

1143
01:27:22,832 --> 01:27:28,437
You need not worry, sir. You'll
get all the votes of this locality.

1144
01:27:31,135 --> 01:27:33,880
And yes, everything must
be done peacefully.

1145
01:27:34,086 --> 01:27:36,118
Don't take the path of
violence at any cost.

1146
01:27:36,198 --> 01:27:39,587
Non-violence.
I believe in non-violence.

1147
01:27:39,855 --> 01:27:42,421
Ok, then, get to your work.
And eat, drink...

1148
01:27:42,501 --> 01:27:44,615
...and be merry at the same time.

1149
01:27:44,695 --> 01:27:45,923
Throw parties. Enjoy life.

1150
01:27:46,118 --> 01:27:46,972
But if that scoundrel, that
goon from Kola Bagan...

1151
01:27:47,052 --> 01:27:48,345
His name is Cheno or something...

1152
01:27:48,745 --> 01:27:53,869
Haru. Haru. What's his name?
- Haru Chokroborty.

1153
01:27:53,949 --> 01:27:57,830
Yes, he is messing with me.
I will break his back.

1154
01:28:00,268 --> 01:28:02,574
If Chenu tries to snatch my votes...

1155
01:28:02,744 --> 01:28:05,814
...or even if he tries
to trouble us...

1156
01:28:06,030 --> 01:28:08,462
...then you can forget non-violence.

1157
01:28:08,765 --> 01:28:11,576
Do whatever it takes,
I will take care of the rest.

1158
01:28:21,485 --> 01:28:23,965
Take it, granny.
We earned 500 rupees today.

1159
01:28:24,270 --> 01:28:26,204
We can't get worse, granny.

1160
01:28:26,978 --> 01:28:29,072
We have done almost everything
that is wrong.

1161
01:28:29,907 --> 01:28:32,285
Jhonte, shall I tell granny
about your girl?

1162
01:28:32,365 --> 01:28:34,640
As if you are as pure
as the holy basil.

1163
01:28:34,891 --> 01:28:37,929
You want to ruin her name?
- Don't say those things.

1164
01:28:38,232 --> 01:28:39,975
I won't believe them.

1165
01:28:41,129 --> 01:28:43,718
Where can we get kids
like you in this world?

1166
01:28:45,551 --> 01:28:48,260
Granny is so good at flattery.

1167
01:28:50,620 --> 01:28:52,485
These are the leaders
of our country, granny.

1168
01:28:53,590 --> 01:28:56,491
Someone goes to the assembly,
someone goes to parliament...

1169
01:28:57,572 --> 01:29:01,517
They are the charioteers of our country.
- Are they?

1170
01:29:01,798 --> 01:29:05,701
Their words and deeds are
as crooked as their faces.

1171
01:29:07,528 --> 01:29:09,930
Once I too saw a national leader.

1172
01:29:11,096 --> 01:29:14,339
He was going somewhere through
our village's station.

1173
01:29:15,247 --> 01:29:17,831
There was a great buzz in
the village since morning.

1174
01:29:18,544 --> 01:29:22,469
All the kids and the women of our
village finished our meals...

1175
01:29:22,966 --> 01:29:25,712
...and went to the station
that was three miles away.

1176
01:29:26,793 --> 01:29:28,803
But when we reach there
we see a small station...

1177
01:29:28,987 --> 01:29:31,030
...was filled with a huge crowd.

1178
01:29:31,110 --> 01:29:32,823
A few minutes later the train
reached the station.

1179
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:35,887
I couldn't go closer.

1180
01:29:36,619 --> 01:29:38,665
I saw him from distance.

1181
01:29:40,035 --> 01:29:43,538
He came to the door
and raised his hand.

1182
01:29:45,008 --> 01:29:47,439
He had a saint's radiance
in his eyes.

1183
01:29:48,770 --> 01:29:51,903
As if he came to enlighten the world.

1184
01:29:53,398 --> 01:29:55,473
He didn't utter even a single word.

1185
01:29:56,686 --> 01:30:00,486
After a few minutes the train
left and he was gone...

1186
01:30:02,425 --> 01:30:04,565
Who was he, granny?
What was his name?

1187
01:30:07,495 --> 01:30:08,976
Deshbandhu Sealdas.

1188
01:30:09,056 --> 01:30:12,756
On that fateful day, in year 1942...

1189
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:17,020
...when from Himayala
to Kanyakumari...

1190
01:30:17,236 --> 01:30:19,333
...the whole country was burning
in the fire of revolt...

1191
01:30:19,413 --> 01:30:22,479
On that day I too renounced
my wife and kids...

1192
01:30:22,695 --> 01:30:25,539
...I too fought the battle
for our country's freedom...

1193
01:30:26,144 --> 01:30:28,825
That day I too went to the jail.

1194
01:30:29,436 --> 01:30:31,700
I suffered the atrocities meted
out at us in the jail...

1195
01:30:34,014 --> 01:30:36,235
I suffered the atrocities
meted out at us...

1196
01:30:38,663 --> 01:30:39,636
Chenu.

1197
01:30:44,385 --> 01:30:45,784
I too bore those atrocities.

1198
01:30:47,074 --> 01:30:49,646
Then one day India got independence.

1199
01:30:50,587 --> 01:30:54,836
We got freedom and you are enjoying
that freedom today.

1200
01:30:55,950 --> 01:30:58,648
But the job is not done yet.

1201
01:30:58,728 --> 01:31:00,956
We need some more sacrifices.

1202
01:31:01,561 --> 01:31:04,270
That's why I came in
front of you again.

1203
01:31:04,350 --> 01:31:07,197
Today our country's condition
is pitiable.

1204
01:31:07,485 --> 01:31:10,220
There's chaos all around.
There's injustice...

1205
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:14,782
...there's poverty, there's
starvation, there's hunger...

1206
01:31:15,820 --> 01:31:20,793
That's why I want to talk
with my young generation...

1207
01:31:21,139 --> 01:31:28,360
...stay with me, spport me.
I will fullfil your wish.

1208
01:31:31,397 --> 01:31:34,594
First of all you save yourself
and then you can save us.

1209
01:31:35,434 --> 01:31:38,836
Let's go. This fool shouldn't
be contesting elections.

1210
01:31:39,971 --> 01:31:42,965
You go home. Tuntun, let's go out.

1211
01:32:35,009 --> 01:32:36,067
Type it.

1212
01:32:41,051 --> 01:32:43,786
See this. My name is not
visible in this poster.

1213
01:32:44,783 --> 01:32:46,216
The name should be in big fonts.

1214
01:32:47,235 --> 01:32:49,577
Have the posters with my
picture arrived? - No.

1215
01:32:49,970 --> 01:32:51,246
Idiot.

1216
01:32:51,829 --> 01:32:54,724
Canvas properly, Chenu.
Canvas properly.

1217
01:32:55,148 --> 01:32:57,291
It's pretty tough this time.

1218
01:32:58,131 --> 01:33:02,185
I feel like the public don't
have any sympathy towards me.

1219
01:33:02,910 --> 01:33:04,143
Why would they have
any sympathy, sir?

1220
01:33:04,737 --> 01:33:07,236
You forget everything
once you come to power.

1221
01:33:07,700 --> 01:33:10,281
You just become inaccessible.
You just vanish.

1222
01:33:10,684 --> 01:33:12,137
I don't belong to that group, Chenu.

1223
01:33:12,217 --> 01:33:13,275
I don't belong to that group.

1224
01:33:13,592 --> 01:33:15,618
I do not belong to that group.

1225
01:33:16,154 --> 01:33:17,985
There is something called gratitude.

1226
01:33:20,258 --> 01:33:22,818
How many times did I bail you
out from police station?

1227
01:33:23,028 --> 01:33:24,760
And in return I too work
so hard for you, sir.

1228
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:27,625
I know. I know. But...

1229
01:33:30,328 --> 01:33:34,025
...the public don't have
any sympathy towards me.

1230
01:33:34,105 --> 01:33:35,636
Even if they don't have any
sympathy towards you...

1231
01:33:35,716 --> 01:33:37,646
...you will get the votes.

1232
01:33:37,949 --> 01:33:40,090
I will grab their scruff and
get the votes. - No. No.

1233
01:33:40,705 --> 01:33:42,143
Don't take the path of non-violence.

1234
01:33:43,159 --> 01:33:44,352
Make the public understand me.

1235
01:33:45,246 --> 01:33:47,717
Raise me in their eyes.

1236
01:33:48,468 --> 01:33:49,624
Praise my virtues.

1237
01:33:51,376 --> 01:33:53,924
Take this. Here's my charity list.

1238
01:33:54,587 --> 01:33:57,358
Look there.
This year I did charity of two lakhs.

1239
01:33:58,598 --> 01:34:01,034
Distribute those
pamphlets in every area.

1240
01:34:01,365 --> 01:34:03,307
Every single person should read it.

1241
01:34:03,755 --> 01:34:05,740
Tell them about my virtues.
Make them understand it.

1242
01:34:06,045 --> 01:34:08,198
The problem is that the public
has started thinking now.

1243
01:34:08,278 --> 01:34:11,348
What! What will the common
man think about!

1244
01:34:12,393 --> 01:34:14,685
What's the need for
the public to think!

1245
01:34:14,934 --> 01:34:18,480
All the scoundrels are entering
politics and ruining this nation...

1246
01:34:18,837 --> 01:34:22,372
No. Don't let them think.
Don't allow them to think.

1247
01:34:23,133 --> 01:34:25,465
We will think on their behalf.
We are here.

1248
01:34:25,971 --> 01:34:29,168
If everyone starts thinking,
then there will be nothing left.

1249
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:31,135
I am unable to understand
what you are saying, sir.

1250
01:34:31,375 --> 01:34:32,685
That's what I want.

1251
01:34:32,765 --> 01:34:34,268
Just keep on working
without thinking too much.

1252
01:34:35,107 --> 01:34:36,612
If you had read history...

1253
01:34:37,138 --> 01:34:41,680
You know who dethroned the
kings and emperors...

1254
01:34:41,853 --> 01:34:43,152
The landlords.

1255
01:34:43,690 --> 01:34:46,383
Who removed the landlords?
The capitalists.

1256
01:34:47,031 --> 01:34:50,392
Who are trying to overthrow
the capitalists? We.

1257
01:34:50,771 --> 01:34:52,836
We talk about democracy
and social equality...

1258
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:54,317
...and became leaders of
the innocent public.

1259
01:34:55,310 --> 01:34:58,048
Whatever comforts they
used to enjoy...

1260
01:34:58,415 --> 01:35:01,140
...we are also enjoying the same.
There is no difference.

1261
01:35:01,475 --> 01:35:03,864
Now who is trying to dethrone us?

1262
01:35:05,269 --> 01:35:10,197
You. The goons.
Did you understand it? - No.

1263
01:35:10,446 --> 01:35:12,446
Great. You don't need
to understand anything.

1264
01:35:12,526 --> 01:35:13,516
Just keep on working.

1265
01:35:13,596 --> 01:35:16,684
All you need to do is follow my orders.
You need not understand anything.

1266
01:35:18,305 --> 01:35:22,668
And one more thing. I heard that
there's someone called Ravi...

1267
01:35:22,748 --> 01:35:24,771
...in Bhanu Ghoshal party and that he
is canvassing in your area.

1268
01:35:26,341 --> 01:35:28,275
If he gives us any
sort of headache...

1269
01:35:28,704 --> 01:35:30,777
...you need not think twice
before finishing him off.

1270
01:35:53,303 --> 01:35:55,392
There are flowers on every tree.

1271
01:35:55,839 --> 01:35:57,795
And in every flower there are peals.

1272
01:35:58,142 --> 01:36:01,483
And the princess of that
kingdom is Muktamala.

1273
01:36:01,991 --> 01:36:06,781
The king had so much wealth,
but Muktamala wasn't happy.

1274
01:36:07,473 --> 01:36:09,069
Two demons attack their kingdom...

1275
01:36:09,149 --> 01:36:12,485
...and eat the people of
that kingdom one by one.

1276
01:36:12,565 --> 01:36:15,658
What was the name of those demons?
- Close your eyes.

1277
01:36:16,403 --> 01:36:17,768
Agasur and Bagasur.

1278
01:36:19,355 --> 01:36:21,344
Now what?
- Brother Ravi.

1279
01:36:21,424 --> 01:36:23,409
Brother Ravi, Govind is not well.
Your father is calling you.

1280
01:36:23,489 --> 01:36:24,696
Come home.

1281
01:36:24,945 --> 01:36:26,207
He's not well.

1282
01:36:27,626 --> 01:36:31,683
Granny.
Granny, Govind is my brother.

1283
01:36:38,761 --> 01:36:40,420
Please come, granny. Please come.

1284
01:36:46,513 --> 01:36:50,668
Has he got high fever, son?
- Yes, it seems so.

1285
01:36:51,085 --> 01:36:52,396
She's our granny.

1286
01:36:55,041 --> 01:36:57,243
Father, shall I call the doctor?

1287
01:36:57,778 --> 01:37:00,246
The doctor came and prescribed
the medicines.

1288
01:37:00,575 --> 01:37:03,849
You go and take rest.
I will take care of him.

1289
01:37:21,352 --> 01:37:22,546
There's nothing to worry about.

1290
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:24,887
You will get well tomorrow.

1291
01:37:24,967 --> 01:37:28,123
He is very good at studies,
unlike me.

1292
01:37:28,338 --> 01:37:32,523
He's my sweet son. He's my nice son.

1293
01:37:33,690 --> 01:37:34,890
You too go and sleep.

1294
01:37:34,970 --> 01:37:36,955
I will call you
if I need something. Go.

1295
01:37:37,035 --> 01:37:39,361
You will stay here alone?
- I am habituated...

1296
01:37:39,441 --> 01:37:41,328
...to stay awake all night.
And also old people...

1297
01:37:41,408 --> 01:37:42,900
...don't get sleep at night. Go.

1298
01:37:43,279 --> 01:37:44,727
Go. I said go.

1299
01:38:23,928 --> 01:38:26,804
I don't think I can
work for too long now.

1300
01:38:27,247 --> 01:38:28,750
I get tired on walking
just a few steps.

1301
01:38:32,043 --> 01:38:33,874
My eyesight is also getting
worse by each passing day.

1302
01:38:35,756 --> 01:38:37,381
I think I might lose them soon.

1303
01:38:41,377 --> 01:38:43,912
I couldn't do anything for you.

1304
01:38:45,681 --> 01:38:47,854
I couldn't leave anything for you.

1305
01:38:52,330 --> 01:38:55,612
And what hurts me most is
that I couldn't even...

1306
01:38:55,692 --> 01:38:58,164
...instill good morals
and ethics in you.

1307
01:40:44,656 --> 01:40:47,920
You are mine.

1308
01:40:48,674 --> 01:40:52,019
No.

1309
01:40:55,468 --> 01:40:58,002
You are mine.
- Mine.

1310
01:40:58,435 --> 01:41:00,180
Mine.
- Mine.

1311
01:41:00,260 --> 01:41:01,473
Mine.
- Mine.

1312
01:41:01,721 --> 01:41:02,698
Mine.
- Mine.

1313
01:41:02,778 --> 01:41:03,892
Mine.
- Mine.

1314
01:41:03,972 --> 01:41:05,398
Mine.
- Mine.

1315
01:41:05,478 --> 01:41:06,763
Mine.

1316
01:41:07,075 --> 01:41:08,484
Mine!

1317
01:41:08,564 --> 01:41:11,554
What rubbish! I said they are mine.

1318
01:41:11,786 --> 01:41:15,014
I am not going to listen to you.
They are mine.

1319
01:41:15,178 --> 01:41:16,718
They are mine.
- Mine. - Mine. - Mine.

1320
01:41:16,798 --> 01:41:17,979
Mine. - Mine.
- Mine. - Mine.

1321
01:41:18,059 --> 01:41:19,180
Mine. - Mine.
- Mine. - Mine.

1322
01:41:19,260 --> 01:41:26,594
Mine. - Mine.
- Mine. - Mine.

1323
01:41:35,339 --> 01:41:38,001
Granny, I am feeling scared.

1324
01:43:17,306 --> 01:43:18,451
So how are you doing, granny?

1325
01:43:18,531 --> 01:43:20,484
What's the matter! I can't
see you these days.

1326
01:43:20,680 --> 01:43:22,113
We are busy with the elections,
granny.

1327
01:43:22,387 --> 01:43:23,375
We are roaming here and
there day and night.

1328
01:43:24,182 --> 01:43:28,301
And why don't you admit these
kids in some school?

1329
01:43:28,895 --> 01:43:30,610
They are getting spoilt at home.

1330
01:43:31,306 --> 01:43:32,841
They are wandering outside
all day long.

1331
01:43:32,921 --> 01:43:34,162
Wait for a few more days, granny.

1332
01:43:34,242 --> 01:43:35,300
I will arrange everything.

1333
01:43:35,810 --> 01:43:39,143
Then I will do one thing.
You all are so busy.

1334
01:43:39,347 --> 01:43:41,843
I will visit my village once...

1335
01:43:41,923 --> 01:43:43,444
...and I will also take
them along with me.

1336
01:43:43,718 --> 01:43:45,675
You are missing your village,
aren't you, granny?

1337
01:43:45,755 --> 01:43:49,022
Yes, son. I feel like my broken
house is calling me...

1338
01:43:49,102 --> 01:43:51,713
...since a few days.

1339
01:43:51,793 --> 01:43:53,238
The elections will take
place the day after tomorrow.

1340
01:43:53,318 --> 01:43:54,496
Wait for a couple of days more.

1341
01:43:54,576 --> 01:43:57,319
I will take you there.
- You will surely come with me?

1342
01:43:57,622 --> 01:43:58,670
You will surely come with me?

1343
01:43:58,750 --> 01:44:00,541
All of us will come, granny.

1344
01:44:00,621 --> 01:44:03,393
We will go there and have
a whale of a time.

1345
01:44:15,353 --> 01:44:17,308
Welcome. Welcome. Welcome,
Mr. Chena.

1346
01:44:17,388 --> 01:44:19,847
Nitish. - Yes. - There're three
votes at your home, right?

1347
01:44:20,086 --> 01:44:24,767
Yes. - All three of you go to
our place at 7 am tomorrow.

1348
01:44:25,589 --> 01:44:26,699
I will explain everything
to you properly.

1349
01:44:26,779 --> 01:44:29,355
Look, mister. Tell me
clearly what you want.

1350
01:44:29,871 --> 01:44:32,094
What do these atrocities mean!
- Atrocities?

1351
01:44:32,498 --> 01:44:34,890
Who is doing atrocities on you?
- You are doing it.

1352
01:44:35,265 --> 01:44:37,741
Just a few minutes ago Mr.
Ravi came here...

1353
01:44:38,335 --> 01:44:40,358
...and threatened us that if
we vote for your candidate...

1354
01:44:40,438 --> 01:44:42,649
...he won't let me run this
shop in this locality.

1355
01:44:42,908 --> 01:44:45,604
And now you came here
and are threatening us.

1356
01:44:45,941 --> 01:44:48,228
Why? What for? Don't we know
whom we should vote...

1357
01:44:48,308 --> 01:44:51,093
...and whom we shouldn't.
Don't we pay tax!

1358
01:44:51,320 --> 01:44:52,585
Can't we make that judgment?

1359
01:44:53,223 --> 01:44:55,180
I have to fix it.

1360
01:44:57,148 --> 01:44:58,478
Hey, come here.

1361
01:45:00,996 --> 01:45:02,715
Shut the shop.
- What do you mean!

1362
01:45:03,212 --> 01:45:04,585
I mean your shop will be closed...

1363
01:45:04,665 --> 01:45:07,039
...and you will come with me. I
will leave you after you cast your vote.

1364
01:45:07,515 --> 01:45:09,515
Come.
- Do I have to come!

1365
01:45:09,595 --> 01:45:11,038
You think there is no law
and order in this country?

1366
01:45:11,118 --> 01:45:14,368
There is law and order, but
you have a young daughter.

1367
01:45:14,448 --> 01:45:17,371
If you are not concerned about her,
you can call the police.

1368
01:45:18,033 --> 01:45:19,747
Come with me. I don't have time.

1369
01:45:39,253 --> 01:45:41,675
Brother Ravi, Chenu has taken
away Nitish forcefully...

1370
01:45:41,755 --> 01:45:42,691
...for his votes.

1371
01:46:04,967 --> 01:46:06,901
Go and tell Chenu that I am coming.

1372
01:46:07,264 --> 01:46:08,937
Tell him not to hide
behind the veil.

1373
01:46:10,799 --> 01:46:13,340
Brother Ravi, I am going to the
college to inform everyone.

1374
01:46:13,870 --> 01:46:14,667
Come, Jhonte.

1375
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:55,736
Granny. Granny. Brother Ravi
is going for a fight...

1376
01:46:55,816 --> 01:46:58,037
...with sticks and all.
There are many people with him.

1377
01:46:59,847 --> 01:47:03,112
Oh God! What are you saying!
What will happen now!

1378
01:47:03,697 --> 01:47:06,789
What will happen now!
Oh God! What's all this!

1379
01:47:10,129 --> 01:47:14,562
Listen. Listen.
My child is getting into a fight...

1380
01:47:14,642 --> 01:47:17,286
Please come and save him.
Please come and save him.

1381
01:47:17,366 --> 01:47:19,520
Who would interfere in those
fights, granny! - Oh God!

1382
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:20,979
What sort of people are you!

1383
01:47:21,059 --> 01:47:23,124
Don't you have sympathy and
compassion for others!

1384
01:47:23,204 --> 01:47:25,654
How can this happen! Stop there.

1385
01:49:21,061 --> 01:49:22,371
Brother Ravi.

1386
01:49:46,531 --> 01:49:47,726
Granny.

1387
01:49:52,704 --> 01:49:53,829
Granny.

1388
01:50:20,583 --> 01:50:22,637
Granny. Let me go.

1389
01:50:22,961 --> 01:50:27,772
Granny. No, I won't come. No.

1390
01:50:40,604 --> 01:50:41,742
She's dead.

1391
01:50:47,858 --> 01:50:49,717
Get in. Get in.

1392
01:50:49,977 --> 01:50:51,654
Get in.

1393
01:50:56,723 --> 01:50:58,528
Get in. Get in.

1394
01:51:02,204 --> 01:51:04,604
Get in. Get in.

1395
01:51:08,485 --> 01:51:09,923
Get in.

1396
01:51:15,050 --> 01:51:16,023
Ram Singh.

1397
01:51:19,406 --> 01:51:20,412
Get in.
