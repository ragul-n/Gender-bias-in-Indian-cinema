1
00:02:10,077 --> 00:02:12,316
"Prakash, where's Father?
- Went to the hospital"

2
00:02:12,671 --> 00:02:15,062
So soon? What's the time?
- It's seven

3
00:02:15,394 --> 00:02:16,956
Went so soon?

4
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,212
"It's angina, Siddarth.
Not good"

5
00:02:33,172 --> 00:02:38,327
"Dr Nayan Shah, that's what you said
on seeing the last cardiogram, too"

6
00:02:40,955 --> 00:02:44,024
"Let's do the stresses tomorrow, and
I want you to go for angiography..."

7
00:02:44,351 --> 00:02:49,145
"Not yet. We'll do... everything,
but not now"

8
00:02:49,732 --> 00:02:52,997
But Siddarth...
- As of now...

9
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,481
I don't want anyone to find out
about my ailment. Not even my son

10
00:02:57,836 --> 00:03:00,686
"Okay, but your treatment...
- Will be done"

11
00:03:01,008 --> 00:03:03,377
Let's give this hospital
a facelift first

12
00:03:03,698 --> 00:03:08,044
This hospital needs lots of aid
and lots of loans

13
00:03:08,406 --> 00:03:12,207
You think if the people find out
that the owner of the hospital...

14
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:15,095
"is a heart patient,
would they give us loans?"

15
00:03:15,422 --> 00:03:18,010
That doesn't mean...
- Nayan...

16
00:03:18,433 --> 00:03:21,600
every department in this hospital
needs better equipments

17
00:03:21,924 --> 00:03:25,441
"Whether it is neurosurgery,
gynaecology, oncology... any department"

18
00:03:25,768 --> 00:03:28,356
"Cardiac, Siddarth.
Everything else comes later"

19
00:03:28,683 --> 00:03:30,790
Do you know how essential it is
for the cardiology department...

20
00:03:31,117 --> 00:03:33,094
to have a CAT lab...?
- Yes

21
00:03:33,424 --> 00:03:35,335
That comes right from the heart
of the heart surgeon

22
00:03:35,602 --> 00:03:39,119
We'll think about ourselves
after all that is done

23
00:03:45,275 --> 00:03:50,015
The pediatric and oncology departments
especially need to be upgraded

24
00:04:05,584 --> 00:04:07,725
Get his CT scan done
and show me

25
00:04:11,926 --> 00:04:15,956
Blood cancer. He was brought in at
the last stage. Passed away at 6 am

26
00:04:20,543 --> 00:04:23,742
"Vinod, what do you feel
when you see a dead body?"

27
00:04:25,828 --> 00:04:27,805
Just tell me how you feel.
You sure must feel something

28
00:04:30,088 --> 00:04:36,838
"Sir, it's routine for doctors.
It becomes a habit"

29
00:04:37,231 --> 00:04:41,327
I have not got into the habit. I've
been at it even before you arrived

30
00:04:41,652 --> 00:04:45,431
I haven't got used to it.
Every time I see a dead body...

31
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,664
I feel I've lost one more battle

32
00:04:50,364 --> 00:04:54,394
A doctor fights diseases.
Diseases are his enemies

33
00:04:56,098 --> 00:04:58,010
"Look, the enemy has won"

34
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,703
Doesn't this loss hurt you?

35
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:19,566
"Being a doctor is a responsibility,
which you should feel every moment"

36
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,869
"That is the time-bomb. See?
- It's a big clot, sir"

37
00:05:34,505 --> 00:05:38,371
Big but not deep.
It's on the surface

38
00:05:41,616 --> 00:05:43,592
Are you really leaving tomorrow?
For two years?

39
00:05:44,146 --> 00:05:48,657
Whoever would miss a scholarship
from an institute like John Hopkins?

40
00:05:50,297 --> 00:05:53,649
Saw the One Day yesterday?
- Sachin Tendulkar is awesome

41
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,324
He's a tiger

42
00:06:03,397 --> 00:06:07,230
"Siddarth, I hope in today's meeting
we get our loan approved"

43
00:06:09,163 --> 00:06:10,309
Jamil Ahmed...

44
00:06:12,975 --> 00:06:15,116
I built this hospital years back

45
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:19,921
"Somehow, I managed to
pull these years"

46
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:25,874
"And still, I have so many plans,
so many desires for the hospital"

47
00:06:26,749 --> 00:06:31,675
But to fulfill them
is an Herculean task

48
00:06:32,355 --> 00:06:36,253
"The more you push ahead,
the more difficult it gets"

49
00:06:37,224 --> 00:06:40,489
"Siddarth, we are all with you"

50
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:44,649
Your son Akash too is with you

51
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,134
"A fine doctor.
What we could not achieve, he will"

52
00:06:51,382 --> 00:06:53,555
That's what gives me courage

53
00:07:14,605 --> 00:07:16,036
Baba...
(Baba - Father)

54
00:07:21,235 --> 00:07:23,146
How was the day?
- Two surgeries

55
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,261
One each in the morning and evening

56
00:07:26,233 --> 00:07:27,510
Went fine?

57
00:07:38,596 --> 00:07:43,140
"Baba, Varma is leaving.
And the replacement..."

58
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,637
"Don't worry,
I've done the arrangement"

59
00:07:47,374 --> 00:07:51,207
"There's a major surgery
the day after, very complicated"

60
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:59,638
And a new anaesthetist would be
assisting me. I'm feeling tense

61
00:08:06,593 --> 00:08:07,542
Yes

62
00:08:09,347 --> 00:08:16,195
A nervous man concentrates more on
his work. A little stress does good

63
00:08:18,989 --> 00:08:21,774
How do we get over that stress
after work hours?

64
00:08:22,352 --> 00:08:23,401
Music

65
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:30,357
You don't play your saxophone
these days? Akash...

66
00:11:59,817 --> 00:12:01,575
I'm in a foul mood.
- What's up?

67
00:12:01,772 --> 00:12:04,360
There was this woman who said
she was a relative of some legislator

68
00:12:04,686 --> 00:12:06,827
"Four months' pregnant, and
wanting to get a sonography done"

69
00:12:07,153 --> 00:12:09,064
She wanted to know
whether it's a boy or a girl

70
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:11,211
"If it's a boy, fine,
and if it's a girl...!"

71
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:13,366
Doesn't she know
gender test is a crime?

72
00:12:13,623 --> 00:12:18,844
I felt like calling up the police.
I calmly told her to meet Dr Sinha

73
00:12:19,229 --> 00:12:20,922
Why there?
He'll shoot her!

74
00:12:21,247 --> 00:12:23,803
Good. She must be sitting
in his office now

75
00:12:24,739 --> 00:12:29,315
"Look, you can't meet Dr Sinha.
We don't entertain such cases"

76
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,168
You may go

77
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:38,829
Please sit inside.
I'll summon Dr Sinha

78
00:12:45,271 --> 00:12:49,105
You want to meet Dr Sinha?
- Yes. I am...

79
00:12:50,204 --> 00:12:54,398
A look at you doesn't tell
that you are... what do I say?

80
00:12:54,913 --> 00:12:59,936
Can I ask you why you picked
this hospital?

81
00:13:00,358 --> 00:13:04,191
I was told by many that
I wouldn't find a better hospital

82
00:13:05,163 --> 00:13:07,369
What are you saying?
- I have heard lots...

83
00:13:07,693 --> 00:13:12,619
about this hospital and its staff.
- You mean you believe what you hear?

84
00:13:12,946 --> 00:13:15,218
Mrs...
- Still a Miss

85
00:13:17,848 --> 00:13:21,364
Another angle this!
You mean you aren't even married?

86
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,699
"For this job,
does one need to be married?"

87
00:13:25,023 --> 00:13:26,813
"No, not at all"

88
00:13:27,297 --> 00:13:29,689
"Let alone a wedding,
you don't need even shame"

89
00:13:30,436 --> 00:13:33,309
"You aren't ashamed at all, no?
- What do you mean?"

90
00:13:33,607 --> 00:13:37,605
"You ask? Firstly you are not married,
moreover you are pregnant"

91
00:13:37,931 --> 00:13:41,382
"Well, it's your life. What have
I got to do with it? Do you know..."

92
00:13:41,712 --> 00:13:45,578
"that, trying to determine the gender
of a unborn baby is a crime?"

93
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:49,075
I could send you to jail.
- And I could send you to the asylum!

94
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:52,250
"However, I'd like to know who you are.
- Dr Akash Sinha. What about you?"

95
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,776
Neha. Dr Neha Mathur

96
00:13:56,382 --> 00:14:00,860
Doctor...? Are you a doctor?
- I am

97
00:14:01,187 --> 00:14:04,060
An anaesthetist.
And not the one you take me for

98
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:12,004
I think there's a misunderstanding
between us

99
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:15,848
"Not us, only you are mistaken.
- You may say that"

100
00:14:21,078 --> 00:14:22,869
"This is Akash Sinha,
neurosurgeon"

101
00:14:23,193 --> 00:14:26,809
"Akash, Dr Neha will replace Varma
in your surgical team"

102
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:28,181
Right sir

103
00:14:30,881 --> 00:14:34,496
Join from tomorrow.
For further details...

104
00:14:34,821 --> 00:14:38,173
contact the hospital's
joint doctor Jamil Ahmed

105
00:14:41,355 --> 00:14:46,029
"Hi Diya. I had been to your ward,
but I didn't find you there"

106
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:48,908
Know why you weren't there?
- Why?

107
00:14:49,235 --> 00:14:51,823
"Because you are sitting here, silly"

108
00:14:55,001 --> 00:14:57,753
Could you show me
Dr Jamil Ahmed's office?

109
00:14:58,845 --> 00:15:02,623
Why not? I've been here for
quite sometime. I know everything

110
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:06,975
"Dr Sinha's office, Dr Harsha's cabin,
Dr Desai's office..."

111
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,212
there's no office
that I can't show you

112
00:15:09,543 --> 00:15:13,256
"Sanju, she only asked
for Dr Ahmed's office"

113
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,737
"Did you hear her?
- I did, I did"

114
00:15:18,736 --> 00:15:23,498
Why do you want to meet Dr Ahmed?
Are you a patient?

115
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:27,379
Or a visitor?
- I'm a doctor. Dr Neha Mathur

116
00:15:28,442 --> 00:15:32,854
I'm Dr Sanjay Arya. And this
is my friend Diya Manchanda

117
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:40,571
"Turn left from over there,
then go straight and turn right..."

118
00:15:40,934 --> 00:15:44,767
again straight and then left...
that's how you come back here

119
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,365
No need to take all that turns

120
00:15:47,854 --> 00:15:51,687
Dr Ahmed's office is right in front.
You can go straight

121
00:15:53,908 --> 00:15:57,457
"Once Saurav and Dravid get set,
no bowler can make a difference"

122
00:16:03,934 --> 00:16:05,845
"Meet Sunil Kapadia,
assistant surgeon"

123
00:16:07,809 --> 00:16:11,905
"I bet they'll make about 400, sir.
- If a wicket doesn't fall"

124
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:17,636
"Dr Mathur, are you watching the match?
- I don't watch cricket"

125
00:16:23,729 --> 00:16:26,961
"Hello Mr Walia, I'm Dr Neha Mathur,
your anaesthetist"

126
00:16:27,349 --> 00:16:30,768
I'm going to administer a shot that
will put you to sleep in ten seconds

127
00:16:31,097 --> 00:16:34,930
You will sleep through the surgery
and wake up in your room

128
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:16,476
"Dr Mathur, he's bleeding more.
- Administering nitroprusside"

129
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,941
The Bp should be in control
within ten minutes

130
00:17:41,022 --> 00:17:43,326
"Dr Mathur, what are you doing?"

131
00:17:44,226 --> 00:17:46,595
There's so much blood
that I can't see the tumour clearly

132
00:17:46,917 --> 00:17:50,269
How can I remove it?
- I'm lowering the blood pressure

133
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,899
But he is hypertensive.
- It's just ooZing out

134
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:57,902
"The brain is tense, Dr Mathur"

135
00:17:58,576 --> 00:18:02,060
Oxygen saturation is hundred percent.
CO2 is also less

136
00:18:02,388 --> 00:18:05,653
The brain shouldn't be tense.
- You mean I'm lying?

137
00:18:05,976 --> 00:18:07,187
Have a look

138
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:09,879
It's ooZing so much!
How can I operate?

139
00:18:10,076 --> 00:18:11,987
It's a vascular tumour at that

140
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,422
I set the blood pressure at 90...
- What am I to do?

141
00:18:14,688 --> 00:18:16,250
Abandon the surgery?

142
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:34,417
I've done the suction.
No problems anymore

143
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:47,035
Good the surgery
was successful in the end

144
00:18:47,553 --> 00:18:49,278
We were so tense

145
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:58,441
Do you have any idea of the problems
I faced because of you?

146
00:18:58,989 --> 00:19:01,774
I was about to talk to you...
- Talk what?

147
00:19:02,095 --> 00:19:04,880
I don't think you've
ever seen neurosurgery

148
00:19:05,203 --> 00:19:08,108
You'd rather be administering
anaesthesia on minor cuts and bruises

149
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,349
Neurosurgery is not your cup of tea

150
00:19:14,204 --> 00:19:17,786
"Controlling Bp during a surgery
was your job, but you couldn't"

151
00:19:18,111 --> 00:19:20,535
There was so much blood that
it hid my view of the tumour

152
00:19:20,898 --> 00:19:24,699
"It's a brain, Dr Mathur.
One slice of the wrong nerve..."

153
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:26,942
"and it could paralyse the patient,
could blind him..."

154
00:19:27,272 --> 00:19:29,184
"could lead to a memory loss,
could do anything to him"

155
00:19:29,963 --> 00:19:32,933
Who offered you a degree?
I don't think you know your job

156
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:36,655
How can I work with you?
You don't know your job

157
00:20:02,188 --> 00:20:05,060
"Dr Akash Sinha, you've said
what you wanted to"

158
00:20:05,391 --> 00:20:07,302
You ought to get into
the habit of listening

159
00:20:09,683 --> 00:20:11,987
It was a case of hypertension
and heart problem

160
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:16,307
"Yet, I set the blood pressure to 90.
Look, I gave 150 mixes..."

161
00:20:16,634 --> 00:20:19,254
even then if the blood...
- You could've raised it to 200

162
00:20:19,581 --> 00:20:21,525
And why 90? And you could've
brought down the blood pressure to 80

163
00:20:21,855 --> 00:20:25,274
I couldn't! No anaesthetist
would do that

164
00:20:26,532 --> 00:20:28,869
He had a heart attack before.
Such low pressure could've led...

165
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:32,772
"to a cardiac arrest, his heart
could've failed. On table arrest"

166
00:20:33,259 --> 00:20:38,829
"Dr Akash Sinha, whether you work
with me or not, I know my job"

167
00:21:02,184 --> 00:21:05,318
Had you carried on with the
nitroprusside at that moment...

168
00:21:05,643 --> 00:21:08,296
it would've been fatal for the patient.
- It was my mistake too

169
00:21:08,621 --> 00:21:12,652
I should've talked to you about his
cardiac status before the surgery

170
00:21:13,395 --> 00:21:16,212
"Anyway, the important thing
is that the operation was successful"

171
00:21:18,328 --> 00:21:22,904
Henceforth we'll discuss beforehand
how I'd go about the operation...

172
00:21:23,229 --> 00:21:28,023
and about your problems. It's better
to clear all that beforehand

173
00:21:28,995 --> 00:21:33,189
"So I'm still in your team?
- Yes, if you are ready..."

174
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:37,705
to work with a rude
and screaming surgeon

175
00:21:41,231 --> 00:21:47,249
You think they brawled yesterday?
- I thought it was the end

176
00:21:48,214 --> 00:21:52,374
"Julie my child,
their innings has just begun"

177
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,813
"I summoned you folks,
because..."

178
00:21:58,176 --> 00:22:02,304
two years back we had prepared
a project report of this hospital

179
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,669
"Well, medical profession is not
the same as it was two years ago"

180
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:12,589
Our needs must've grown too

181
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,821
So I want you to review the report

182
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:24,087
"If you wish to add something, let
Dr Ahmed know the details, so that..."

183
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,455
You wish to say something?

184
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:30,238
"Actually sir, we've seen
the report too"

185
00:22:30,976 --> 00:22:35,618
"And we think, those whom we will hand
over the report, aren't doctors"

186
00:22:36,005 --> 00:22:38,179
So what?
- We want the language in the report...

187
00:22:38,503 --> 00:22:42,631
such that even those without a
medical background can understand it

188
00:22:42,988 --> 00:22:46,854
You mean to say the presentation
should be even better?

189
00:22:47,216 --> 00:22:48,647
Right.
- It is possible

190
00:22:48,978 --> 00:22:52,593
"You think you both can do something?
- We can try, sir"

191
00:22:53,078 --> 00:22:56,791
"Watching the passion, the obsession
for the hospital in Dr Sinha..."

192
00:22:57,114 --> 00:22:58,741
induces excitement

193
00:22:59,068 --> 00:23:01,559
That's what is on his mind
every moment

194
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,468
All he did was build this hospital
and look after me

195
00:23:05,859 --> 00:23:09,124
"Never did anything for himself,
didn't even marry"

196
00:23:10,567 --> 00:23:12,457
Didn't marry?
- Right

197
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:18,540
"You mean, you...?
- His son, adopted"

198
00:23:22,388 --> 00:23:26,865
Years back an entire family
was wiped out in a train accident

199
00:23:28,185 --> 00:23:32,500
The lone survivor was badly injured
...she was pregnant

200
00:23:34,591 --> 00:23:39,681
She died in the hospital
soon after delivery

201
00:23:41,511 --> 00:23:45,825
The baby was supposed to be
sent to the orphanage...

202
00:23:46,412 --> 00:23:51,851
but wonder why and how a young doctor
in the hospital grew fond of the baby

203
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:56,723
He decided to raise the baby

204
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:04,981
And that's it. Baba's decision
changed my life completely

205
00:24:06,399 --> 00:24:08,310
Made me what I am
out of nothing

206
00:24:11,044 --> 00:24:14,790
"Dr Mathur, it's my story.
How come you got emotional?"

207
00:24:16,073 --> 00:24:19,372
Tears don't look good in
a doctor's eye. What are you doing?

208
00:24:22,704 --> 00:24:26,766
Dr Mathur...
- You can call me Neha

209
00:24:27,444 --> 00:24:29,169
On one condition

210
00:24:30,391 --> 00:24:33,045
If you call me Akash

211
00:24:42,852 --> 00:24:45,855
Now that we've taken responsibility
of this project...

212
00:24:46,183 --> 00:24:49,001
we'll start once we find time
after tomorrow's surgeries

213
00:25:38,588 --> 00:25:40,859
"Dr Mathur, have you been
to Marise Road?"

214
00:25:41,214 --> 00:25:43,126
No.
- A new restaurant has come up

215
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:46,941
"Spice Routes. AmaZing fare,
and the joint too is good"

216
00:25:47,268 --> 00:25:51,648
"So I think of inviting you to lunch.
Good fare, good place..."

217
00:25:51,977 --> 00:25:55,428
"besides, you'll have my company.
If you are free..."

218
00:25:56,045 --> 00:26:00,720
"Dr Arya, I think you very well know
I got an operation in the afternoon"

219
00:26:01,042 --> 00:26:04,242
And I can't come.
Even then you invite me?

220
00:26:10,716 --> 00:26:14,681
"Today's operation went smoothly.
- Yes, it could've consumed time"

221
00:26:15,072 --> 00:26:16,600
But it went well

222
00:26:17,154 --> 00:26:19,425
"Sir, your tea is here"

223
00:26:37,463 --> 00:26:40,979
"And yes, I think you got two
operations on Monday and Tuesday"

224
00:26:41,307 --> 00:26:43,032
Check with Dr Ahmed

225
00:26:45,311 --> 00:26:46,294
Bye

226
00:26:49,955 --> 00:26:53,603
Last night I watched the match
between India and West Indies

227
00:26:56,714 --> 00:26:58,603
Did you watch Sachin bat?

228
00:27:13,851 --> 00:27:17,531
It's a new match.
Do you see?

229
00:27:32,013 --> 00:27:34,154
Sleeping?
- No

230
00:27:34,896 --> 00:27:36,720
Reading?
- No

231
00:27:37,587 --> 00:27:41,551
"Must be thinking something?
- Yes, about something special"

232
00:27:41,879 --> 00:27:44,085
About someone special?
- Right

233
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:49,211
May I know who the
fortunate one is...

234
00:27:49,598 --> 00:27:54,753
whom Neha Mathur has been
thinking about at 11:02 pm?

235
00:27:55,813 --> 00:27:57,637
Shall I say it?
- Sure

236
00:27:58,855 --> 00:28:01,706
I was thinking about you.
- Really?

237
00:28:04,077 --> 00:28:05,387
Thinking what?

238
00:28:06,832 --> 00:28:09,388
What you told me about yourself

239
00:28:09,715 --> 00:28:12,587
Strange.
I too was thinking about you

240
00:28:13,334 --> 00:28:16,119
You haven't told me about yourself

241
00:28:16,442 --> 00:28:19,128
I'll tell you when we meet.
- Why not meet now?

242
00:28:19,485 --> 00:28:21,626
Now? At this hour?
- Yes

243
00:28:22,207 --> 00:28:25,374
I'm not that far away.
- What...? Where are you?

244
00:28:26,051 --> 00:28:27,963
Right in front of your house

245
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:50,678
It's a full moon night

246
00:28:53,663 --> 00:28:55,519
Let's go on a drive

247
00:28:56,546 --> 00:28:59,745
No.
- Why not? You hate moonlight?

248
00:29:00,069 --> 00:29:02,559
Nothing of that sort.
- Don't you venture out...

249
00:29:02,887 --> 00:29:06,568
without your mother's permission?
- Nothing of that sort too

250
00:29:06,892 --> 00:29:08,322
Then what is it?

251
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:13,128
Forgot to get into my sneakers

252
00:29:35,401 --> 00:29:38,535
"Wonder what's come over me"

253
00:29:39,084 --> 00:29:42,186
"My heart seems lost"

254
00:29:42,735 --> 00:29:45,967
"Though I'm awake, I feel I'm asleep"

255
00:29:46,772 --> 00:29:48,683
"Isn't it?"

256
00:29:50,391 --> 00:29:56,377
"Why do I find everything new?"

257
00:29:57,246 --> 00:30:00,446
"Why do I find this earth new?"

258
00:30:00,801 --> 00:30:03,652
"Why do I find the sky new?"

259
00:30:04,325 --> 00:30:09,830
"The world itself seems new"

260
00:31:49,998 --> 00:31:52,335
"Fragrance in the light..."

261
00:31:52,658 --> 00:31:54,962
"colour in the breeZe..."

262
00:31:56,597 --> 00:32:01,840
"why do I find so?"

263
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:06,745
"Buds singing..."

264
00:32:07,072 --> 00:32:09,463
"echoing all over..."

265
00:32:10,627 --> 00:32:16,349
"why do I find so?"

266
00:32:18,347 --> 00:32:23,404
"I find my dreams bathed
in moonlight everywhere I go"

267
00:32:24,369 --> 00:32:28,203
"Isn't it?"

268
00:32:31,192 --> 00:32:34,611
"Wonder where we have come to"

269
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:38,140
"To the valleys..."

270
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:41,945
"of dreams"

271
00:32:42,403 --> 00:32:44,860
"Isn't it?"

272
00:32:46,182 --> 00:32:52,036
"Why do I find everything new?"

273
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:56,140
"Why do I find this earth new?"

274
00:32:56,465 --> 00:32:59,501
"Why do I find the sky new?"

275
00:32:59,988 --> 00:33:05,690
"Our world itself seems new"

276
00:33:06,908 --> 00:33:09,813
"Wonder what's come over me"

277
00:33:10,302 --> 00:33:13,175
"My heart seems lost"

278
00:33:13,602 --> 00:33:17,217
"Though I'm awake, I feel I'm asleep"

279
00:33:17,638 --> 00:33:21,056
"Isn't it?"

280
00:33:35,224 --> 00:33:38,096
"You guys?
Good I found you, Akash"

281
00:33:38,427 --> 00:33:40,600
The engine seems faulty

282
00:33:42,014 --> 00:33:44,121
Engine is troubling?
- Yes

283
00:33:47,012 --> 00:33:49,218
"Right, the engine is messing it up"

284
00:33:50,663 --> 00:33:51,612
Right

285
00:33:54,507 --> 00:34:00,044
"The engine is indeed messing it up,
but what are you guys doing here?"

286
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:05,746
"Well, I was showing Neha
...I mean Dr Mathur, the waterfall"

287
00:34:06,102 --> 00:34:10,297
"Yes... there's a waterfall around,
isn't it?"

288
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:14,871
Really? So this team of doctors
are here to check on the waterfall?

289
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,591
What's wrong with the waterfall?
It needs a surgery?

290
00:34:17,923 --> 00:34:21,701
"No, it's a beautiful waterfall.
You must've seen it, right?"

291
00:34:23,272 --> 00:34:25,511
It's been a long time
since I saw a waterfall

292
00:34:26,187 --> 00:34:30,893
"No big deal, I guess. The water
comes cascading down, that's all"

293
00:34:31,216 --> 00:34:33,127
Where else will it go?

294
00:34:34,387 --> 00:34:37,456
"Well, at your age everything
seems beautiful. Right, Dr Mathur?"

295
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:42,417
"Right.
- Akash, I hope you drove in here?"

296
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:44,986
Or did you come swimming?
- What...?

297
00:34:48,224 --> 00:34:52,702
"Yes, we got a car.
- Done. The mechanic brings my car"

298
00:34:53,029 --> 00:34:57,311
And I'll go with you.
- Sure... I'll get the car

299
00:34:59,724 --> 00:35:01,384
So get it

300
00:35:10,647 --> 00:35:14,131
"Nice place, really.
Must keep visiting"

301
00:35:15,227 --> 00:35:16,690
Baba...
- Yes?

302
00:35:17,342 --> 00:35:21,175
You must buy a new car now.
- What use?

303
00:35:21,891 --> 00:35:24,315
All that remains in my life
is old stuff

304
00:35:25,798 --> 00:35:30,789
"Baba, shall I drop Dr Mathur?
- How can you drop her just like that?"

305
00:35:31,468 --> 00:35:34,318
She's a good doctor...
- I mean...

306
00:35:35,344 --> 00:35:39,123
shall I drop her home?
- Oh! That's all right

307
00:35:42,134 --> 00:35:46,808
"Who d'you have in your family, doctor?
- I and my Mother"

308
00:35:47,132 --> 00:35:50,168
"Same with Akash's family.
He and his father, that is me"

309
00:35:53,859 --> 00:35:55,770
"Parents are strange, you see"

310
00:35:57,702 --> 00:35:59,941
First they are worried
about their children's studies

311
00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:03,147
Then they are worried if their
children would find a job or not

312
00:36:03,468 --> 00:36:06,024
"Later, they worry over whether
their children will marry or not"

313
00:36:07,312 --> 00:36:12,172
I keep thinking about Akash

314
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:18,163
Does your mother too
have such worries?

315
00:36:19,516 --> 00:36:22,868
"No, she doesn't have such worries"

316
00:36:23,552 --> 00:36:24,699
All right

317
00:36:28,005 --> 00:36:32,614
Quite often parents don't
get the opportunity to worry

318
00:36:35,084 --> 00:36:39,595
"These days all parents do, is fix
the wedding date and a reception hall"

319
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:51,988
I shall have this
one complaint against you

320
00:36:53,309 --> 00:36:54,390
About?

321
00:36:56,032 --> 00:36:59,833
"You found the girl of your choice,
and you didn't even tell me"

322
00:37:00,997 --> 00:37:02,592
Valid complaint

323
00:37:05,642 --> 00:37:08,361
You haven't told me
everything either

324
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:10,541
What have I kept from you?
You can ask me whatever you want to

325
00:37:11,472 --> 00:37:13,034
"Shall I?
- Yes, go ahead"

326
00:37:14,323 --> 00:37:16,660
Whose picture is inside that drawer?
- That?

327
00:37:18,423 --> 00:37:19,766
This one?

328
00:37:20,089 --> 00:37:22,262
"I'm sorry if I...
- No, no secrets between us"

329
00:37:22,939 --> 00:37:25,844
Kalpana.
Kalpana was her name

330
00:37:27,904 --> 00:37:32,251
I was a fresher
when I first met her

331
00:37:34,535 --> 00:37:38,051
"I can't say what attracted me
towards her, but..."

332
00:37:39,564 --> 00:37:45,004
"I had never seen such a girl before,
nor did I see another"

333
00:37:48,213 --> 00:37:52,046
In just a few meetings
we came very close to each other

334
00:37:53,018 --> 00:37:57,495
A very deep and strong relationship
was formed

335
00:38:00,512 --> 00:38:04,128
However...
things just didn't work out

336
00:38:06,375 --> 00:38:07,423
Why not?

337
00:38:09,098 --> 00:38:13,193
Kalpana's father was stinking rich.
The conditions he laid down...

338
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:17,037
"for the wedding,
I just couldn't concur"

339
00:38:17,714 --> 00:38:20,564
And Kalpana wasn't brave enough
to go against her father

340
00:38:20,885 --> 00:38:23,255
So... she was married

341
00:38:25,497 --> 00:38:28,883
She found a gentleman in her husband.
They are settled in London now

342
00:38:29,245 --> 00:38:33,046
"Kids are grown up,
their daughter is married"

343
00:38:35,107 --> 00:38:37,444
Fine... she's happy

344
00:38:40,809 --> 00:38:45,287
But why didn't you marry?
Why did you live all alone?

345
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:47,591
"I didn't marry,
I didn't live alone either"

346
00:38:47,856 --> 00:38:50,029
You've been with me.
Here...

347
00:38:51,636 --> 00:38:53,044
"small one, please"

348
00:38:54,326 --> 00:38:57,395
"Listen Akash,
R. K Jaitley had called again"

349
00:38:57,722 --> 00:39:00,026
He's throwing a party at
his farmhouse tomorrow afternoon

350
00:39:00,348 --> 00:39:02,423
"I can't make it,
you go"

351
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:05,723
"Not I, Baba.
- Strange. Poor guy..."

352
00:39:06,051 --> 00:39:08,923
he keeps making donations
for the hospital

353
00:39:09,253 --> 00:39:11,295
You could just drop in
for a few minutes

354
00:39:40,164 --> 00:39:43,201
She asked me whether I knew her.
I said I didn't know her

355
00:39:43,528 --> 00:39:46,400
"So you dumped her.
- No, she dumped me"

356
00:39:47,243 --> 00:39:50,825
"Mrs Jaitley, who's that guy
talking to your husband?"

357
00:39:51,216 --> 00:39:53,771
"Akash, your glass is empty.
- No more"

358
00:39:54,099 --> 00:39:57,298
"Come on, one for the road.
- No, please"

359
00:40:02,747 --> 00:40:05,116
Are you Dr Akash Sinha?
- Yes

360
00:40:05,437 --> 00:40:06,780
A surgeon?

361
00:40:11,363 --> 00:40:14,912
"One and the same. Tell me, what
do you do in the operation theatre?"

362
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:19,237
"Suppose, you got a knife
and a head before you?"

363
00:40:21,742 --> 00:40:24,592
The brain's visible now.
Blood all over

364
00:40:24,945 --> 00:40:27,119
"Blood, of course
when a surgery is on"

365
00:40:27,443 --> 00:40:30,031
"But in a neurosurgery,
blood doesn't flow like bucketfuls"

366
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:41,824
"Tell me something.
You watch brains, don't you?"

367
00:40:42,147 --> 00:40:45,980
"Do you see a person's memories,
his thoughts, dreams..."

368
00:40:46,374 --> 00:40:51,977
"and the schemes he hatches?
- No, nothing can be seen"

369
00:40:54,383 --> 00:40:56,621
"Dr Sinha, I haven't yet seen
an operation theatre"

370
00:40:56,945 --> 00:40:59,118
And I'd like you to never see one.
- Why?

371
00:40:59,444 --> 00:41:01,683
Only doctors and patients
get into operation theatres

372
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:05,073
"You aren't a doctor, and I'd never
want you to become a patient"

373
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:11,286
Hear the music?

374
00:41:13,569 --> 00:41:15,579
It's Johann Strauss'
Voices of Spring

375
00:41:18,663 --> 00:41:21,863
You know about music too.
- Somewhat

376
00:41:24,204 --> 00:41:26,989
You don't know about that dance?
Somewhat?

377
00:41:27,312 --> 00:41:30,828
I know. But I've never
requested for a dance...

378
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:33,460
to a girl whose name
I don't know

379
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:37,266
"Full name, Sonia Kapoor.
Born in East Africa..."

380
00:41:37,593 --> 00:41:40,181
brought up in London. I flew here
only a couple of days back

381
00:41:42,398 --> 00:41:45,947
My Father is setting up industries
here. He's a big businessman

382
00:41:46,275 --> 00:41:48,284
Gulshan Kapoor is the name.
- Gulshan Kapoor?

383
00:41:48,613 --> 00:41:51,650
I've read that name somewhere.
- Probably

384
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,214
He's one of the ten richest Indians
in the world

385
00:41:56,140 --> 00:42:01,897
"And I'm his only child,
pampered and spoilt"

386
00:42:03,635 --> 00:42:05,262
It shows

387
00:42:06,582 --> 00:42:09,585
"Not spoilt,
but a little different"

388
00:42:12,925 --> 00:42:16,125
"Too stuffed and crowded here,
and it's hot too"

389
00:42:18,018 --> 00:42:20,159
His heartbeats stopped and he died?
- Right

390
00:42:20,484 --> 00:42:23,804
"Then we gave him a heart massage,
and his heart revived"

391
00:42:24,169 --> 00:42:27,041
Again?
- Yes. He's alive and kicking today

392
00:42:29,837 --> 00:42:34,064
He's still alive because
you didn't give up for eight hours

393
00:42:34,579 --> 00:42:36,686
Same here. I don't give up

394
00:42:38,871 --> 00:42:42,322
Very glad to meet you.
- Same here

395
00:42:42,939 --> 00:42:46,324
"But I should leave now. Bye.
- Why, why?"

396
00:42:46,815 --> 00:42:49,371
What's the hurry?
- You are a tycoon's daughter

397
00:42:49,698 --> 00:42:52,516
You can wake up at will.
But we got to wake up early

398
00:42:52,837 --> 00:42:54,846
Early in the morning? Damn

399
00:42:55,464 --> 00:42:58,598
How early?
- Before six. I go for a jog

400
00:42:59,564 --> 00:43:01,671
Jog? That's fine

401
00:43:04,144 --> 00:43:06,285
"You jog every morning, right?
Then hold this"

402
00:43:06,899 --> 00:43:09,487
Let's race up to the gate.
Let's see who wins

403
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:15,475
No way.
- Oh come on. It's a short distance

404
00:43:17,437 --> 00:43:19,414
"We start here.
And, let's race"

405
00:43:19,744 --> 00:43:23,009
"Sonia, I'm not racing.
Wear your sandals"

406
00:43:23,363 --> 00:43:27,109
"Why won't you race, Akash?
Please buddy, come on"

407
00:43:33,869 --> 00:43:35,627
What madness is this?

408
00:43:37,809 --> 00:43:40,878
"Akash, you need
to be craZy sometimes"

409
00:44:06,606 --> 00:44:11,433
"Sonia, Dr Joshi will perform
a minor surgery on you"

410
00:44:12,404 --> 00:44:16,718
I hope he won't amputate my leg?
- Don't be silly. It's a minor surgery

411
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:21,046
What about the anaesthetist?
- I've called up Dr Mathur

412
00:44:21,565 --> 00:44:22,679
Here she is

413
00:44:22,974 --> 00:44:24,798
Akash? What are you doing here?
- I...

414
00:44:25,089 --> 00:44:26,814
He brought in the patient

415
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:31,813
"Yes. This is Sonia.
Sonia, that's Dr Neha Mathur"

416
00:44:37,293 --> 00:44:41,388
Can you call one of your family
members here? Got to sign this form

417
00:44:41,714 --> 00:44:46,225
Dad isn't here. Why don't you sign?
- No... I can't do that

418
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:50,358
"Well, sign it yourself"

419
00:44:56,608 --> 00:44:58,203
"Here, signed"

420
00:45:00,676 --> 00:45:03,909
"Akash, you will be with me
at the time of the surgery, won't you?"

421
00:45:04,232 --> 00:45:07,170
"Don't worry, I'll be with you,
so will she"

422
00:45:13,137 --> 00:45:18,260
"I have no qualms about the operation,
but is that injection essential?"

423
00:45:18,614 --> 00:45:22,874
"Once anaesthesia is administered, you
won't feel the pain during surgery"

424
00:45:26,334 --> 00:45:28,060
Please don't leave my hand

425
00:45:35,015 --> 00:45:37,636
Where were you running?
How did you fall?

426
00:45:38,122 --> 00:45:39,847
Turn this way

427
00:45:44,753 --> 00:45:47,090
We were racing.
- Racing?

428
00:45:49,558 --> 00:45:53,718
"Actually, it's like this... I'll
tell you after the shot is given"

429
00:46:16,368 --> 00:46:21,643
"Is this hospital reputed?
- It's the best in Chandipur, sir"

430
00:46:22,102 --> 00:46:24,406
The building doesn't seem good

431
00:46:25,113 --> 00:46:29,340
"Around the world, 50,000 people
work in his industries and offices"

432
00:46:33,633 --> 00:46:35,577
A film ought to be made on Daddy

433
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:43,712
How did this happen?
A splint? Does it hurt?

434
00:46:45,293 --> 00:46:46,724
Lt'll be all right

435
00:46:47,183 --> 00:46:49,356
"You?
- Dad, he's Dr..."

436
00:46:51,219 --> 00:46:54,571
"Doctor, did you fix
my daughter's leg well? I hope..."

437
00:46:54,903 --> 00:46:57,808
"Mr Kapoor, I did not operate on her.
- You didn't?"

438
00:46:58,138 --> 00:47:02,103
"You said he's a doctor.
- Dad, he's a neurosurgeon"

439
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:05,248
"Had I fallen on my head,
he would've operated on me"

440
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:06,651
I see

441
00:47:10,278 --> 00:47:12,190
He's the one who brought me
to the hospital

442
00:47:14,506 --> 00:47:16,898
You are embarrassing me.
Anyone in my place...

443
00:47:17,197 --> 00:47:19,655
"No Akash, you've been very sweet"

444
00:47:19,984 --> 00:47:21,895
Very kind of you.
But I have done nothing great

445
00:47:27,319 --> 00:47:29,973
I only wanted to know whether
there is a surgery on Saturday

446
00:47:30,362 --> 00:47:32,273
"If no, shall I fix
an appointment with Dr Joshi?"

447
00:47:32,476 --> 00:47:36,791
"Of course, there is a surgery.
Tell Dr Joshi you are busy"

448
00:47:37,281 --> 00:47:39,869
"Your cellphone was switched off,
that's why I had to come here"

449
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:44,325
Excuse me... book two more rooms
for me in this hospital

450
00:47:44,744 --> 00:47:46,656
I'm staying here as long as
you are here

451
00:47:46,891 --> 00:47:48,802
Talk to my PA outside

452
00:47:51,439 --> 00:47:53,416
"I'm a doctor,
not a booking clerk"

453
00:47:53,618 --> 00:47:56,817
She's Dr Neha Mathur.
- A doctor?

454
00:48:00,151 --> 00:48:03,733
"And this is a hospital,
not a hotel where you can put up"

455
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:08,217
Dad can't even get a room?

456
00:48:09,665 --> 00:48:11,576
Rooms here are only meant
for patients

457
00:48:15,335 --> 00:48:17,442
He doesn't know!
I can buy this hospital

458
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:21,155
I can live in all the rooms.
I'm Gulshan Kapoor

459
00:48:21,485 --> 00:48:23,909
"I know, Dad.
Don't get worked up"

460
00:48:25,745 --> 00:48:27,569
"Whoever he is, I don't care"

461
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:31,470
He was asking me to book two rooms
in the hospital

462
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:36,660
"Madam, try the lentil curry.
- He's unaware of the system"

463
00:48:37,309 --> 00:48:39,733
Why are you backing him?
- Different types of people...

464
00:48:40,063 --> 00:48:42,400
"visit the hospital. If you encounter
some stupid chap, just tolerate him"

465
00:48:42,723 --> 00:48:47,102
Why should I tolerate? You do that.
And you have a nice reason to tolerate

466
00:48:47,431 --> 00:48:50,948
What reason? What is the reason?
- Now don't provoke me

467
00:48:51,275 --> 00:48:54,891
What do you mean? Be explicit.
- Why should I?

468
00:48:55,215 --> 00:48:57,039
You understand everything

469
00:48:58,963 --> 00:49:00,874
"Sir, try the lentil curry"

470
00:49:03,639 --> 00:49:06,292
You didn't take pickles?
- I saw it...

471
00:49:06,651 --> 00:49:09,075
but I didn't feel like it.
I'll try it now

472
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:12,157
Shall I give some of mine? Is it okay?
- Please

473
00:49:12,544 --> 00:49:16,345
Pickles from your plate
would be fun

474
00:49:19,143 --> 00:49:22,976
"Dr Akash, call for you.
It's from the lady in room 35"

475
00:49:33,557 --> 00:49:35,764
Yes Sonia? Tell me

476
00:49:37,177 --> 00:49:41,239
"No... listen to me...
I can't, Sonia"

477
00:49:42,269 --> 00:49:43,481
"All right, coming"

478
00:49:54,474 --> 00:49:56,385
For you and me

479
00:49:57,453 --> 00:50:03,122
Hospitals follow rules. Doctors
don't sit and eat with patients

480
00:50:05,044 --> 00:50:07,185
Understand what I'm saying

481
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,267
I understand

482
00:50:10,842 --> 00:50:13,081
No problem. I'll throw it out

483
00:50:13,853 --> 00:50:16,606
What are you doing?
What are you upto?

484
00:50:19,459 --> 00:50:22,561
Today is my birthday.
No one remembers

485
00:50:23,303 --> 00:50:25,760
"I thought,
with you I shall..."

486
00:50:29,998 --> 00:50:31,592
It's your birthday?

487
00:50:32,944 --> 00:50:38,000
Never mind. I'm sorry
I kicked up a fuss

488
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:40,630
"Kick up a fuss, you must,
on your birthday"

489
00:50:40,952 --> 00:50:44,119
"To begin with,
a very very happy birthday"

490
00:50:46,526 --> 00:50:50,786
"Secondly, if we were to forget
the rules for one day..."

491
00:50:51,106 --> 00:50:54,525
it won't call for a disaster.
Let's have lunch together

492
00:50:58,122 --> 00:51:00,994
Happiness on your birthday
will keep you happy all the year

493
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:09,009
"Your cellphone, sir"

494
00:51:16,604 --> 00:51:18,678
Did you give him his cellphone?
- I did

495
00:51:19,007 --> 00:51:21,824
What was he doing?
- Lunching with the lady in room 35

496
00:51:22,146 --> 00:51:24,417
Chinese.
- Chinese...?

497
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:25,689
Yes

498
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:30,372
I didn't ask you their menu.
Go

499
00:51:41,365 --> 00:51:44,597
No better way to explain
the hospital's requirement...

500
00:51:45,016 --> 00:51:48,183
to a person off
the medical profession

501
00:51:50,975 --> 00:51:55,452
Project over. But the presentation
would cost at least 150 million

502
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:58,652
How are we to organise that much?
- The government won't give us

503
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:03,140
I've spoken to Seetalwal Corporation

504
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:18,832
"I don't intend to flatter you, but
your job on this project report..."

505
00:52:19,099 --> 00:52:21,010
was really excellent

506
00:52:24,704 --> 00:52:27,871
Thank you very much. At least
you liked something about me

507
00:52:31,335 --> 00:52:33,759
I'd like it if you do
something worth it

508
00:52:34,698 --> 00:52:38,050
And I thought these days you don't
like anything but Chinese cuisine

509
00:52:39,183 --> 00:52:41,903
I see. So you've been spying on me?

510
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:46,226
Spying? Won't the entire
hospital talk...

511
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:48,884
if doctors were to
eat Chinese food with patients?

512
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:52,469
"For your information,
I don't like Chinese food much"

513
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:56,125
"Because, they don't share pickles"

514
00:52:57,281 --> 00:53:00,153
You interfere in every little thing.
- I saw you do that

515
00:53:00,516 --> 00:53:03,334
"Unlike you I don't believe in rumours.
- You had Chinese food with her, no?"

516
00:53:07,852 --> 00:53:10,407
"Neha, she's a silly girl.
She was overly emotional"

517
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:12,905
"It was her birthday today, so I..."

518
00:53:13,681 --> 00:53:15,537
It was the poor girl's birthday

519
00:53:15,988 --> 00:53:21,295
Poor girl? Birthday? Forget today
her birthday is not even in this month

520
00:53:21,689 --> 00:53:24,080
Her birth date is 17th March.
And this is October

521
00:53:24,508 --> 00:53:28,406
17th March? How do you know?
- I saw her admission form

522
00:53:28,993 --> 00:53:31,297
I know her age too.
What did she say about her age?

523
00:53:31,683 --> 00:53:34,238
Why would I ask her age?
- I don't know

524
00:53:34,919 --> 00:53:38,981
Strange! Why did she lie to me?
- She's smitten

525
00:53:40,204 --> 00:53:44,910
"No good. Were you smitten,
it'd be more like it"

526
00:53:46,001 --> 00:53:47,912
Why would I? Reason?

527
00:53:50,134 --> 00:53:53,006
"Reason, I've fallen
head over heals for you"

528
00:53:53,978 --> 00:53:55,572
Lie.
- Honestly

529
00:53:56,988 --> 00:53:58,900
Honestly?
- Absolutely

530
00:53:59,743 --> 00:54:01,655
Do you believe me?

531
00:54:02,787 --> 00:54:04,064
I do

532
00:54:08,392 --> 00:54:13,448
"Akash, you've no idea
how you have changed my life"

533
00:54:14,221 --> 00:54:16,842
A little louder.
I didn't hear that

534
00:54:49,585 --> 00:54:53,932
"You walked into my life,
and what a way it was"

535
00:54:54,581 --> 00:54:57,005
"I breathe out a song..."

536
00:54:57,401 --> 00:54:59,312
"and you are the reason"

537
00:55:09,893 --> 00:55:12,384
"You tell me..."

538
00:55:12,776 --> 00:55:16,872
"why wouldn't I hum
when my heart churns out a song?"

539
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:21,421
"You walked into my life,
and what a way it was"

540
00:55:22,322 --> 00:55:24,298
"I breathe out a song..."

541
00:55:24,628 --> 00:55:26,539
"and you are the reason"

542
00:56:17,384 --> 00:56:19,296
"Now that I have you..."

543
00:56:19,787 --> 00:56:26,122
"there's laughter in my life,
my life has changed for the better"

544
00:56:32,536 --> 00:56:37,145
"My days are more bright,
my nights are more colourful"

545
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:41,177
"A new high overcomes me"

546
00:56:42,530 --> 00:56:45,020
"Believe..."

547
00:56:45,381 --> 00:56:49,444
"what the night says,
what the weather tries to say"

548
00:56:49,833 --> 00:56:52,137
"In my life..."

549
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:09,427
"You walked into my life,
and what a way it was"

550
00:57:10,013 --> 00:57:11,925
"I breathe out a song..."

551
00:57:12,192 --> 00:57:14,812
"and you are the reason"

552
00:57:55,179 --> 00:57:57,090
"Before you..."

553
00:57:57,484 --> 00:58:04,082
"I never dreamt"

554
00:58:10,137 --> 00:58:14,932
"You came, and
you brought along..."

555
00:58:15,455 --> 00:58:19,201
"love that
was unheard and unspoken of"

556
00:58:20,483 --> 00:58:22,395
"Listen..."

557
00:58:23,046 --> 00:58:27,306
"my heart wants
to express that love"

558
00:58:27,755 --> 00:58:29,579
"In my life..."

559
00:58:32,656 --> 00:58:36,817
"You walked into my life,
and what a way it was"

560
00:58:37,461 --> 00:58:42,255
"I breathe out a song,
and you are the reason"

561
00:59:24,003 --> 00:59:27,202
How are you feeling?
- You don't have time to look me up

562
00:59:28,455 --> 00:59:31,939
When is the splint to be taken off?
- Tomorrow

563
00:59:32,396 --> 00:59:34,154
And I'm going home tomorrow

564
00:59:37,456 --> 00:59:40,241
"Tell me something.
We'll keep meeting, won't we?"

565
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:46,969
Or... won't we meet?
- Why not?

566
00:59:47,995 --> 00:59:50,485
Honestly?
- I always speak the truth

567
00:59:52,095 --> 00:59:55,612
"Sonia, why did you lie to me?"

568
00:59:57,220 --> 01:00:00,420
Which lie?
- About your birthday that never was

569
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:05,867
Why did you tell that lie?
- Oh that one? Only to stop you

570
01:00:10,802 --> 01:00:13,936
"Sonia, you're still
a stubborn little kid..."

571
01:00:14,518 --> 01:00:18,351
who will never make a compromise.
- You're right. That's me

572
01:00:19,002 --> 01:00:24,375
"I want every wish of mine,
anything I want, to be..."

573
01:00:25,184 --> 01:00:28,930
"All right, tell me something.
What's your biggest wish?"

574
01:00:31,046 --> 01:00:37,162
Lmagine that a djinn
appears before us and asks...

575
01:00:37,581 --> 01:00:42,190
What's your biggest wish?
It will be done

576
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:45,450
What do I say?

577
01:00:47,254 --> 01:00:53,140
I'd say that let this hospital
expand and become equipped...

578
01:00:54,077 --> 01:00:56,950
as my Father has been
dreaming about since years

579
01:00:58,209 --> 01:01:00,121
I could wish nothing more

580
01:01:06,570 --> 01:01:09,868
"Sonia, you wanted to see me?
What's the matter?"

581
01:01:10,253 --> 01:01:13,126
Does it still hurt?
- Not at all

582
01:01:13,456 --> 01:01:15,629
Good. What did you want to tell me?

583
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:18,894
Mr Saxena on the line

584
01:01:22,457 --> 01:01:23,702
You may go

585
01:01:23,931 --> 01:01:25,842
"Tell me dear, what is it?"

586
01:01:30,753 --> 01:01:32,665
Remember we were in London
when I was eight?

587
01:01:33,412 --> 01:01:36,197
And I insisted on a Barbie doll
from a particular store

588
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:40,360
Everyone said it was a Sunday
and the store was closed

589
01:01:41,004 --> 01:01:43,308
But I insisted...
I want it right now

590
01:01:43,694 --> 01:01:47,527
I want it right now.
- Right now and right here

591
01:01:53,497 --> 01:01:56,369
I don't know how you contacted
those toy store chaps

592
01:01:57,404 --> 01:01:59,577
But the Englishman
wouldn't open the shop

593
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:05,179
"I don't know how much you paid him,
but you got the Barbie doll for me"

594
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:19,826
"Now I get it.
Tell me, who is he?"

595
01:02:30,974 --> 01:02:33,846
Does he love you?
- I don't know

596
01:02:37,701 --> 01:02:43,140
You want to marry him?
- I think he loves someone else

597
01:02:44,428 --> 01:02:49,222
Is he nuts? You are Sonia Kapoor.
Gulshan Kapoor's daughter

598
01:02:55,670 --> 01:02:58,542
"Jamil Ahmed, I'm here
because you insisted"

599
01:02:59,162 --> 01:03:02,995
Do you think this Mr Gulshan Kapoor
will do something for our hospital?

600
01:03:03,807 --> 01:03:05,369
He said he will

601
01:03:08,452 --> 01:03:10,363
A busy doctor
has come to my house

602
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:14,687
Come in

603
01:03:18,733 --> 01:03:20,295
What will you have?

604
01:03:23,827 --> 01:03:26,000
"Dr Ahmed told me, you said
something about the hospital..."

605
01:03:29,977 --> 01:03:34,553
I hear you want to expand the hospital
and make it well-equipped and modern

606
01:03:35,838 --> 01:03:38,230
You've been talking to the
Ministry of Health for some years

607
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:43,999
You recently forwarded a project report
to Seetalwal Finance Corporation

608
01:03:48,235 --> 01:03:52,013
In the committee that approves loans
at Seetalwal Finance Corporation...

609
01:03:52,399 --> 01:03:56,495
"there are guys who highly respect you,
the winner of the highest honour"

610
01:03:57,268 --> 01:03:59,725
But there are some
who are against you

611
01:04:01,015 --> 01:04:04,368
They say approving that much money for
a hospital is not good business sense

612
01:04:05,276 --> 01:04:08,345
Now there's no saying whether
your loan will be approved or not

613
01:04:10,914 --> 01:04:12,442
But it's tough

614
01:04:14,758 --> 01:04:17,957
Are you listening?
- Every word

615
01:04:19,882 --> 01:04:22,755
But I fail to understand...

616
01:04:24,463 --> 01:04:26,921
why our hospital's
financial affairs interest you

617
01:04:27,378 --> 01:04:30,764
"I can give you the money you need,
about 150 million that is"

618
01:04:31,157 --> 01:04:34,936
"Not a loan, not on credit.
A simple donation"

619
01:04:41,344 --> 01:04:46,138
"If I'm doing something, I'm sure
you'd like to reciprocate"

620
01:04:48,391 --> 01:04:49,986
What can I do for you?

621
01:04:58,417 --> 01:05:00,874
"Today you met Gulshan Kapoor,
didn't you?"

622
01:05:04,728 --> 01:05:07,600
Sonia was telling that
he was much impressed by our hospital

623
01:05:08,315 --> 01:05:11,450
And he's ready to finance it.
- No

624
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:16,828
But she was saying...
- It's not happening. Forget it

625
01:05:24,075 --> 01:05:28,749
"Baba, I have never heard such
disappointment in your tone"

626
01:05:32,596 --> 01:05:34,507
Nothing of that sort

627
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,312
Only that sometimes I'm down

628
01:05:39,802 --> 01:05:44,509
"Dr Siddarth Sinha, you showed me
the answer to work and stress"

629
01:06:09,547 --> 01:06:11,786
"The car broke down, uncle?
- Yes son"

630
01:06:12,045 --> 01:06:13,956
Can I help?

631
01:06:38,376 --> 01:06:40,614
Sister...

632
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:43,945
are you hurt?

633
01:06:47,024 --> 01:06:48,936
My child...

634
01:06:50,932 --> 01:06:53,170
Let me take you
to the hospital

635
01:09:28,881 --> 01:09:31,339
Master!
What happened to the master?

636
01:09:35,256 --> 01:09:37,112
"Doctor, over here!"

637
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:45,759
Get the stretcher!
Hurry up!

638
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:49,924
Take him to the emergency ward.
He has bled much

639
01:10:07,865 --> 01:10:09,776
"Save the boy, doctor"

640
01:10:17,731 --> 01:10:19,642
"Baba, I'm with you"

641
01:10:20,453 --> 01:10:23,718
"Look after the kid...
- Don't speak, Baba"

642
01:10:24,362 --> 01:10:27,398
The boy's guts are out...
his lung mustn't collapse

643
01:10:29,967 --> 01:10:31,878
Just lie down!

644
01:10:41,530 --> 01:10:43,092
Siddarth...

645
01:10:45,342 --> 01:10:47,002
where have you been?

646
01:10:47,264 --> 01:10:49,755
"Baba, I'll become a doctor like you"

647
01:10:52,069 --> 01:10:53,980
Your son Akash is with you

648
01:10:54,183 --> 01:10:56,225
"Baba, shall I iron this dress?"

649
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:01,673
Why must you quit everything
and go to Chandipur?

650
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:05,512
You can marry Kalpana
on one condition

651
01:11:05,938 --> 01:11:08,013
Do you remember?
The term of lease is getting over

652
01:11:08,405 --> 01:11:11,540
"You are tired, Baba.
- No hospitals here for miles, sir"

653
01:11:12,249 --> 01:11:14,161
Where will you get him treated?

654
01:11:20,321 --> 01:11:22,396
Akash...
- Yes Baba?

655
01:12:18,875 --> 01:12:21,114
"Akash, why are you sitting
in the dark?"

656
01:12:34,059 --> 01:12:40,776
Why didn't Baba marry
the girl he loved?

657
01:12:42,836 --> 01:12:44,747
I found some old letters

658
01:12:48,345 --> 01:12:50,901
The girl's father
had laid down a condition...

659
01:12:53,150 --> 01:12:57,377
the orphan that Baba was raising
should not stay with him

660
01:13:00,325 --> 01:13:02,432
He should send him to the orphanage

661
01:13:06,923 --> 01:13:10,440
"Neha, Baba spurned his love..."

662
01:13:12,369 --> 01:13:14,281
but didn't abandon me

663
01:13:15,252 --> 01:13:17,164
He did not abandon me

664
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:29,023
How large was his heart! He never
let me know that he did me a favour

665
01:13:29,794 --> 01:13:32,896
And what have I done for him?
Nothing

666
01:13:35,432 --> 01:13:37,344
You can do

667
01:13:45,682 --> 01:13:49,199
This is his dream.
You will have to make it come true

668
01:14:22,071 --> 01:14:24,889
"Dr Ahmed, there's bad news"

669
01:14:26,267 --> 01:14:30,647
Seetalwal Finance Corporation just
called. They refuse to give us a loan

670
01:14:31,072 --> 01:14:33,081
"Akash, I have worse news"

671
01:14:34,531 --> 01:14:38,397
One thing all of us forgot.
The land where the hospital stands...

672
01:14:38,856 --> 01:14:42,689
was taken on lease 30 years back by
Siddarth. The lease ends in 6 months

673
01:14:43,404 --> 01:14:45,316
Look... 6 months' notice

674
01:14:45,998 --> 01:14:50,378
Unless we renew the lease...
but how will we?

675
01:14:51,412 --> 01:14:54,546
How can we organise the money to
pay the lease rates prevailing?

676
01:14:56,216 --> 01:14:58,455
Lmplying?
- It implies that...

677
01:14:59,997 --> 01:15:02,301
this hospital is going to shut down
in 6 months

678
01:15:06,307 --> 01:15:08,862
Any idea? Any choice? Any way out?

679
01:15:14,218 --> 01:15:17,866
Gulshan Kapoor had himself given Baba
an offer. Why didn't he accept it?

680
01:15:18,383 --> 01:15:20,556
You don't know?
- No

681
01:15:21,234 --> 01:15:24,336
Gulshan Kapoor was willing to
provide everything to the hospital...

682
01:15:24,725 --> 01:15:27,216
only if you married her daughter

683
01:15:28,313 --> 01:15:30,103
Know what Siddarth told him?

684
01:15:31,163 --> 01:15:33,883
"He said,"Mr Gulshan Kapoor,
my son is not up for sale"

685
01:15:38,435 --> 01:15:43,229
"All those dreams that Baba had
for this hospital, will come true"

686
01:15:44,841 --> 01:15:46,753
You and I wish the same

687
01:15:49,102 --> 01:15:52,848
"But for the two of us,
the path ahead seems difficult"

688
01:15:55,220 --> 01:15:59,053
"Akash, for me, this hospital
does not mean only a job"

689
01:15:59,833 --> 01:16:03,797
"It has become a part of my life.
Tell me, what is it?"

690
01:16:13,991 --> 01:16:16,295
I got to say it
with a heavy heart

691
01:16:17,835 --> 01:16:20,390
You got to hear it
with a brave heart

692
01:16:22,703 --> 01:16:25,520
"Tell me what it is, Akash"

693
01:16:30,327 --> 01:16:32,883
"Neha, I have decided
to marry Sonia"

694
01:17:12,637 --> 01:17:17,115
Place the order for all the equipments
that are mentioned in this

695
01:17:17,570 --> 01:17:19,808
Mr Kapoor has already placed
the order. He has ordered...

696
01:17:20,132 --> 01:17:22,818
the equipments mentioned in the project
report to be delivered within a month

697
01:17:23,208 --> 01:17:25,599
"Sir, there's a legal formality
to be done"

698
01:17:26,091 --> 01:17:29,356
Dr Ahmed says you have
the power of attorney

699
01:17:29,934 --> 01:17:34,347
"Yes. What is this?
- Sir, our company is offering you..."

700
01:17:34,739 --> 01:17:39,151
equipments worth about 150 million.
Mr Gulshan will own this property...

701
01:17:39,544 --> 01:17:43,956
for seven years. After which...
- It'll be transferred to the hospital

702
01:17:44,668 --> 01:17:48,185
"For you, Mr Gulshan has extended
the term of lease to 99 years"

703
01:17:48,577 --> 01:17:50,651
So that you won't have
any problems in future

704
01:17:51,139 --> 01:17:55,136
What problems can come in the way with
a businessman like Mr Kapoor around?

705
01:17:55,528 --> 01:17:59,722
It's nothing but a legal formality.
Mandatory in corporate systems

706
01:18:00,909 --> 01:18:02,601
You are right

707
01:18:07,764 --> 01:18:09,676
Some things are just mandatory

708
01:18:15,419 --> 01:18:18,554
So many corridors in this hospital.
I brought something for you

709
01:18:22,114 --> 01:18:23,741
Invitation for my wedding

710
01:18:25,670 --> 01:18:28,542
Don't think that I've been
distributing invites to everyone

711
01:18:28,937 --> 01:18:32,388
It's only for a chosen few.
Akash's friends

712
01:18:32,781 --> 01:18:35,598
"Like Sanjay, Dr Ahmed and you"

713
01:18:36,241 --> 01:18:38,479
I thought of personally
inviting you folks

714
01:18:44,985 --> 01:18:48,469
"But I guess I can't make it,
because..."

715
01:18:48,796 --> 01:18:52,248
Can't make it? What do you mean?
How is it possible?

716
01:18:53,986 --> 01:18:59,688
"Look Neha, I hate emotional talks.
But this much I must say"

717
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:04,743
"You guys are Akash's colleagues,
his friends, his family..."

718
01:19:05,453 --> 01:19:08,326
if you can't make it...
I'll tell Akash...

719
01:19:08,913 --> 01:19:11,020
to fix the wedding on the day
you can make it

720
01:19:12,757 --> 01:19:14,931
"I don't care,
but you are coming"

721
01:19:16,601 --> 01:19:18,326
"All right Sonia, I will come"

722
01:19:23,328 --> 01:19:25,053
I got to invite Sanjay too

723
01:20:03,784 --> 01:20:05,608
This is Dr Sanjay Arya

724
01:20:13,298 --> 01:20:16,170
"Sanjay, what do you specialise in?
- Pediatrics"

725
01:20:19,063 --> 01:20:21,367
"Mr Kapoor, she is Dr Neha Mathur"

726
01:20:25,469 --> 01:20:27,893
Take them in and tend to them.
- Yes sir. Please

727
01:20:28,929 --> 01:20:31,550
"Welcome, Dr Jaitley.
- Why do you call me a doctor?"

728
01:20:33,285 --> 01:20:37,697
So many doctors have arrived that
I'm possessed addressing them

729
01:21:01,346 --> 01:21:04,218
"The two of you will sign first,
and then two witnesses from each side"

730
01:21:04,677 --> 01:21:06,916
But first the couple signs

731
01:21:22,487 --> 01:21:26,768
"Who signs for you, Akash?
- Dr Desai and Dr Jamil"

732
01:21:27,548 --> 01:21:33,304
"From our side, Jaitley and...
- My choice, Dad. Neha"

733
01:21:47,695 --> 01:21:49,323
"Go on, it's an honour"

734
01:21:59,740 --> 01:22:03,223
"Tell me O'life..."

735
01:22:03,936 --> 01:22:07,649
"whatever happened,
why did it happen?"

736
01:22:17,325 --> 01:22:21,485
"Why have I lost every happiness?"

737
01:22:22,162 --> 01:22:25,362
"Who has cursed me?"

738
01:22:31,035 --> 01:22:34,584
"Tell me O'life..."

739
01:22:35,583 --> 01:22:38,783
"whatever happened,
why did it happen?"

740
01:22:40,004 --> 01:22:43,520
"Why have I lost every happiness?"

741
01:22:44,296 --> 01:22:48,009
"Who has cursed me?"

742
01:22:49,517 --> 01:22:53,067
"Who all am I answerable to?"

743
01:22:53,778 --> 01:22:57,229
"Why is my heart in despair?"

744
01:22:57,685 --> 01:23:03,387
"Do I have an answer...?
Why are my dreams shattered?"

745
01:23:11,332 --> 01:23:15,165
"Tell me O'life..."

746
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:19,266
"whatever happened,
why did it all happen?"

747
01:23:47,751 --> 01:23:51,584
"Wet days
and dark nights..."

748
01:23:52,396 --> 01:23:55,661
"bathed in showers of tears"

749
01:24:10,334 --> 01:24:13,534
"Should I be asked how I feel..."

750
01:24:13,922 --> 01:24:19,623
"how do I say
how I hurt my heart?"

751
01:24:27,247 --> 01:24:30,829
"Tell me O'life..."

752
01:24:33,172 --> 01:24:36,175
"whatever happened..."

753
01:24:37,081 --> 01:24:38,992
"why did it happen?"

754
01:24:46,210 --> 01:24:47,805
We're married

755
01:24:54,057 --> 01:24:58,153
"Are you happy?
- Yes Sonia, I'm very happy"

756
01:24:59,664 --> 01:25:03,661
You are happy. That makes
Mrs Sinha really very happy

757
01:25:10,394 --> 01:25:15,669
"Akash, the two of us
are going to start a new life"

758
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:20,800
And I don't want to keep
anything from you about my past

759
01:25:21,893 --> 01:25:25,989
I don't want that you hear something
in future and tell me...

760
01:25:26,730 --> 01:25:28,641
"Sonia, why didn't you tell me?"

761
01:25:30,414 --> 01:25:32,326
I'll never feel that way

762
01:25:33,425 --> 01:25:37,138
"My concern is with your future,
not with your past"

763
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:42,351
But I wish to tell you

764
01:25:49,153 --> 01:25:53,281
"When I was studying in London,
there was this guy..."

765
01:25:54,438 --> 01:25:57,638
"he and I, you know..."

766
01:25:58,314 --> 01:26:04,036
"Actually, we wanted to marry
but later I felt that..."

767
01:26:04,464 --> 01:26:08,297
Rahul too felt...
his name was Rahul

768
01:26:09,814 --> 01:26:12,686
"That, we were so different
from each other"

769
01:26:14,298 --> 01:26:19,224
So we stopped seeing. And now
I don't even know where he is

770
01:26:22,306 --> 01:26:23,649
Through?

771
01:26:24,228 --> 01:26:25,604
Satisfied?

772
01:26:26,150 --> 01:26:32,168
Forget it. What was and was not before
marriage is of no importance

773
01:26:34,157 --> 01:26:37,674
You too must've had an affair
- Not again

774
01:26:38,194 --> 01:26:41,842
"Look, I've told you everything.
- I never asked"

775
01:26:42,486 --> 01:26:46,320
"All right, I won't ask.
I told you about myself"

776
01:26:47,291 --> 01:26:49,847
Shall I tell you about yourself?
- Tell what?

777
01:26:51,455 --> 01:26:58,172
I think... you and Neha!
Right?

778
01:26:58,823 --> 01:27:01,509
Tell me.
- Whatever. Nothing exists anymore

779
01:27:02,154 --> 01:27:04,393
Whatever? Which means there was

780
01:27:08,848 --> 01:27:10,759
"Shall I tell you something, Akash?"

781
01:27:12,596 --> 01:27:15,861
I never met a guy called Rahul

782
01:27:19,003 --> 01:27:22,836
Never? But just now you said...
- It was a lie

783
01:27:23,231 --> 01:27:26,365
And I lied because I wanted to hear
from you about you and Neha...

784
01:27:26,691 --> 01:27:29,563
"about whatever you had.
In fact, you're still carrying on"

785
01:27:29,893 --> 01:27:35,845
What are you talking?
- Neha Mathur can't stay in your life

786
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:40,396
"I can't take it, Akash.
- Sonia, don't be silly"

787
01:27:40,784 --> 01:27:43,275
Neha is out of my life.
- But she is in the hospital

788
01:27:43,988 --> 01:27:47,024
She's a very good doctor.
And the hospital needs her

789
01:27:47,928 --> 01:27:51,346
"The hospital? Or you? Apart from
the two of you, there is..."

790
01:27:51,676 --> 01:27:54,231
"hardly anyone in the operation theatre.
Besides, the patient is unconscious..."

791
01:27:54,622 --> 01:27:58,073
"who'd hardly know what's happening.
- Sonia, don't talk in a way..."

792
01:27:58,562 --> 01:28:01,499
that'd make you fall in my esteem.
- You think you can scare me?

793
01:28:01,894 --> 01:28:06,601
"No! I'm trying to reason with you.
- Trying to reason, eh?"

794
01:28:08,204 --> 01:28:12,813
"So you want me to be
a sweet homely wife, eh?"

795
01:28:13,778 --> 01:28:17,294
And you'd have fun with Neha
in the hospital

796
01:28:18,582 --> 01:28:20,177
Look Sonia...

797
01:28:21,465 --> 01:28:25,299
as long as your mind holds such crap
I wouldn't like to touch you

798
01:28:25,629 --> 01:28:27,540
Akash...

799
01:28:57,148 --> 01:28:58,360
Baba?

800
01:29:04,580 --> 01:29:06,436
What have you done?

801
01:29:12,396 --> 01:29:16,229
"To save the hospital,
to make my dreams come true..."

802
01:29:16,496 --> 01:29:18,735
you have surely chosen this path...

803
01:29:22,006 --> 01:29:25,839
"but the moment you stepped on it,
you found thorns strewn all over"

804
01:29:27,772 --> 01:29:30,644
How far will you tread?
- As far as life takes me

805
01:29:32,256 --> 01:29:36,089
"The path that you had chosen,
you stuck to it for life"

806
01:29:37,701 --> 01:29:40,638
It's not that easy to bury
your love with your own hands

807
01:29:41,225 --> 01:29:44,741
I know. But I'm trying my best

808
01:29:46,126 --> 01:29:50,833
"And now that I'm bound in
a relationship, I shall preserve it"

809
01:29:51,892 --> 01:29:54,349
I shall never be unfaithful

810
01:29:55,127 --> 01:29:57,999
From you I seek strength
and blessings

811
01:29:58,522 --> 01:30:03,131
"That will be forever with you, Akash.
I'll be with you, always"

812
01:30:04,544 --> 01:30:05,822
Always

813
01:30:15,274 --> 01:30:19,108
What are you looking for?
- I had kept a yellow file somewhere

814
01:30:19,663 --> 01:30:21,575
I kept it up there

815
01:30:30,234 --> 01:30:31,577
"Bye, Ma"

816
01:30:37,922 --> 01:30:40,412
Yes?
- Are you all right?

817
01:30:40,804 --> 01:30:42,978
What's wrong with me?
I'm absolutely fine

818
01:30:43,687 --> 01:30:47,073
But I think you're not keeping well.
You've been eating less

819
01:30:47,627 --> 01:30:50,762
You need a complete checkup.
I'll fix an appointment with Dr Desai

820
01:30:59,063 --> 01:31:01,301
I was on my way to meet you.
- Me?

821
01:31:01,561 --> 01:31:04,826
Yes.
- I wanted to talk to you

822
01:31:05,596 --> 01:31:07,868
"Tell me.
- Oh come on, not like this"

823
01:31:08,287 --> 01:31:11,739
"We'll walk for sometime,
then sit somewhere and sip coffee..."

824
01:31:12,260 --> 01:31:16,355
and then we'll talk. I need to
discuss something important with you

825
01:31:26,931 --> 01:31:31,091
"Neha, I know everything
about you and Akash"

826
01:31:33,657 --> 01:31:35,569
Akash himself told me

827
01:31:39,807 --> 01:31:45,508
"Akash told me clearly,
"Sonia, that chapter is closed"

828
01:31:46,342 --> 01:31:50,307
"I hate to even meet Neha, but
I can't help it in the hospital"

829
01:31:51,403 --> 01:31:53,128
Akash said that

830
01:31:55,759 --> 01:31:58,796
Why are you silent?
Won't you say something?

831
01:32:00,019 --> 01:32:03,437
"I'm silent because
I have nothing to say, Sonia"

832
01:32:04,632 --> 01:32:06,127
Right

833
01:32:07,579 --> 01:32:09,850
"I can understand
your plight, Neha"

834
01:32:10,493 --> 01:32:13,813
It hurts very badly when
some poor girl is scorned like this

835
01:32:16,196 --> 01:32:19,516
"Neha, you mustn't stay here.
That's respectable for you"

836
01:32:21,705 --> 01:32:24,261
And that's good for you and Akash.
Right?

837
01:32:25,004 --> 01:32:26,500
"Well, right"

838
01:32:27,951 --> 01:32:32,145
"I can help you, Neha.
America, England, Germany..."

839
01:32:32,276 --> 01:32:34,515
"anywhere for that matter,
if you want a job..."

840
01:32:34,870 --> 01:32:41,106
"my Dad has good contacts. Besides,
sooner or later you'll find a nice boy"

841
01:32:46,690 --> 01:32:49,563
"If you need any help,
I'm there"

842
01:32:50,534 --> 01:32:56,290
"You want me to quit this hospital
and this city for good, isn't it?"

843
01:32:58,222 --> 01:32:59,816
"Yes, exactly"

844
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:03,025
And I don't want you to hover
like a shadow between me and Akash

845
01:33:03,411 --> 01:33:06,862
"Go away, please. And I'm willing
to pay any price for it"

846
01:33:12,636 --> 01:33:15,836
I can't believe my ears

847
01:33:17,537 --> 01:33:20,322
I thought such things happen
only in Hindi movies

848
01:33:27,370 --> 01:33:30,243
You have no right to maintain any
kind of relationship with my husband

849
01:33:31,855 --> 01:33:35,689
The man I was concerned with before
was not your husband

850
01:33:36,404 --> 01:33:39,156
"And, I have nothing to do
with your husband"

851
01:33:39,543 --> 01:33:42,808
"Dr Neha Mathur, you will have
to quit the hospital and this city!"

852
01:33:52,036 --> 01:33:53,379
Sonia...

853
01:34:03,374 --> 01:34:05,285
"What happened, Sonia?"

854
01:34:08,435 --> 01:34:10,292
"Tell me, what is it?"

855
01:34:13,496 --> 01:34:15,735
I met Neha today

856
01:34:22,145 --> 01:34:24,056
"What is the matter, Akash?"

857
01:34:27,270 --> 01:34:29,127
Sonia told me about
yesterday's discussion

858
01:34:30,730 --> 01:34:33,351
"I know, she had no right
to talk to you like that"

859
01:34:34,318 --> 01:34:36,229
No right at all

860
01:34:38,162 --> 01:34:40,073
She is embarrassed

861
01:34:40,724 --> 01:34:43,924
She wept all night.
She wants to apologise to you

862
01:34:45,849 --> 01:34:48,405
She realises that
she was rude to you

863
01:34:49,693 --> 01:34:53,112
I'd request you to forgive her

864
01:34:54,626 --> 01:34:58,012
She's genuinely embarrassed.
- I'm embarrassed

865
01:34:58,982 --> 01:35:03,460
"What do I say? Now that
you have said it, it's past now"

866
01:35:06,990 --> 01:35:09,546
If you could tell that
to Sonia in person...

867
01:35:09,873 --> 01:35:12,746
she's here to apologise.
- No need

868
01:35:20,668 --> 01:35:26,205
"Neha, I don't know what came over me
and I just ranted at you"

869
01:35:28,132 --> 01:35:30,436
I've forgotten it.
You too put that behind you

870
01:35:36,780 --> 01:35:39,019
"Yes, doctor?
I'll be right there"

871
01:35:43,955 --> 01:35:46,379
So you've forgiven me?
- Yes Sonia

872
01:35:48,475 --> 01:35:50,135
You've forgiven me?

873
01:35:51,295 --> 01:35:55,904
"Really? By the way,
who are you to forgive me?"

874
01:36:01,865 --> 01:36:06,179
I knew you'd squeal it to Akash

875
01:36:07,183 --> 01:36:10,764
That's why I thought I'd rather
not give you the opportunity

876
01:36:11,475 --> 01:36:14,347
"Shame on you! I regret
the way you think, Sonia"

877
01:36:15,319 --> 01:36:21,337
You rue me? One day
the entire hospital will rue you

878
01:36:21,725 --> 01:36:25,241
You ought to be ashamed!
Such filthy thoughts! Full of venom

879
01:36:25,952 --> 01:36:29,404
"Neha, you have all the right
to blow up on me"

880
01:36:29,829 --> 01:36:32,287
But I'm really sorry. Forgive me.
- What the hell...?

881
01:36:32,679 --> 01:36:35,169
"If you want,
I'll grovel at your feet"

882
01:36:36,267 --> 01:36:38,178
"Sonia, what are you upto?"

883
01:36:38,797 --> 01:36:41,899
"Neha, I don't find this right"

884
01:36:42,545 --> 01:36:45,745
Someone is apologising. Don't you
think you ought to be a bit cordial?

885
01:36:47,030 --> 01:36:48,373
No Akash

886
01:36:50,874 --> 01:36:53,113
She can tell me whatever she wants

887
01:36:54,173 --> 01:36:57,591
"Sonia, nobody has the right
to tell you whatever comes to mind"

888
01:36:58,145 --> 01:37:01,247
You are my wife.
And everyone ought to realise that

889
01:37:05,929 --> 01:37:09,315
"Neha, if you can,
try to forgive me"

890
01:37:21,625 --> 01:37:25,076
Hi Neha. I was here to collect
some blood reports

891
01:37:25,469 --> 01:37:27,380
So I thought of dropping in

892
01:37:42,766 --> 01:37:47,888
"Look Neha, I won't ask you anything,
you won't tell me anything either"

893
01:37:49,493 --> 01:37:53,588
But listen to this. I have learnt
something from the children

894
01:37:55,258 --> 01:37:59,092
"No matter how it hurts, no matter what
ails you, come what may, be cheerful"

895
01:38:00,223 --> 01:38:03,903
Look at Diya.
No knowing long she'll live

896
01:38:05,196 --> 01:38:07,107
Yet she is always smiling

897
01:38:08,912 --> 01:38:12,428
"In comparison to her pain
and problems, what is ours?"

898
01:38:13,140 --> 01:38:17,235
Nothing at all.
- You are right

899
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:19,158
AmaZing

900
01:38:20,187 --> 01:38:22,360
The other day you snatched
my chewing gum

901
01:38:23,070 --> 01:38:26,456
Today you agree to my words.
It's giving my confidence a boost

902
01:38:29,476 --> 01:38:33,408
Lunchtime is over. I think
I'd rather invite you for dinner

903
01:38:34,216 --> 01:38:36,455
What say? Can I?

904
01:38:38,060 --> 01:38:41,260
Here's my story.
My parents are in Delhi

905
01:38:42,609 --> 01:38:45,426
I got a little sister
who is a doctor in Chicago

906
01:38:45,844 --> 01:38:51,513
"And I'm here. Ours is a small family.
Father, Mother, sister and me"

907
01:38:52,314 --> 01:38:55,579
I have no family
except my mother

908
01:38:56,062 --> 01:38:59,448
"If you need a family, tell me.
My family is ready"

909
01:39:02,726 --> 01:39:05,925
I said that fifty percent in humour
and fifty percent in seriousness

910
01:39:07,754 --> 01:39:11,752
But I think of raising the percentage
of seriousness a little higher...

911
01:39:12,495 --> 01:39:14,886
and tell you something.
- What's that?

912
01:39:17,140 --> 01:39:23,224
"Neha, I think it won't be bad
if we marry"

913
01:39:26,204 --> 01:39:30,584
But your attitude shows
you are more on the negative side

914
01:39:31,554 --> 01:39:35,071
So don't answer me right now.
Think a little

915
01:39:35,462 --> 01:39:37,886
"In fact, give it a good thought.
- All right..."

916
01:39:38,281 --> 01:39:40,520
I'll give it a good thought and...

917
01:40:20,274 --> 01:40:22,186
"Sit, buddy. We'll sit over there.
- No"

918
01:40:22,485 --> 01:40:24,397
Why don't we sit together?
Yes Sanjay?

919
01:40:54,197 --> 01:40:56,883
The two of you are regulars here?
- I don't know about Neha

920
01:40:57,080 --> 01:40:58,608
But I'm a regular here

921
01:41:10,757 --> 01:41:15,748
"All right, one asparagus soup.
- No. You won't like it"

922
01:41:24,114 --> 01:41:26,026
"What about you, sir?
- Do you serve poison?"

923
01:41:26,293 --> 01:41:29,362
Pardon me?
- Get me any good soup

924
01:41:29,752 --> 01:41:33,979
Listen... I'll place the order
for everyone. Come here

925
01:41:34,621 --> 01:41:37,919
"Neha, tomorrow's surgery
has been postponed to Friday"

926
01:41:38,401 --> 01:41:40,542
All right.
Tomorrow Dr Joshi...

927
01:41:42,789 --> 01:41:45,126
"No discussions about hospitals,
surgeries and diseases here"

928
01:41:45,320 --> 01:41:47,045
"Okay, place the order"

929
01:41:55,698 --> 01:41:59,215
What more do you need
than a fine evening with friends?

930
01:42:06,878 --> 01:42:07,991
"Great food, no?"

931
01:42:09,408 --> 01:42:11,068
We should keep meeting like this

932
01:42:21,644 --> 01:42:23,556
You knew it

933
01:42:26,641 --> 01:42:29,327
"You knew it, didn't you?
- Knew what?"

934
01:42:29,716 --> 01:42:32,785
That Neha would be there.
- What rot!

935
01:42:33,272 --> 01:42:36,624
"You knew it, you knew it.
- Sonia, dinner was your idea"

936
01:42:37,020 --> 01:42:39,258
I didn't want to go.
- Then...?

937
01:42:43,746 --> 01:42:46,050
Then why did you come?
- Because you forced me

938
01:42:47,301 --> 01:42:49,125
Why should I keep quiet?

939
01:43:06,905 --> 01:43:08,533
Something important?

940
01:43:08,988 --> 01:43:11,925
Dr Jamil Ahmed isn't in. You too
are on the board of directors...

941
01:43:12,255 --> 01:43:14,166
so I thought I'd...

942
01:43:27,951 --> 01:43:30,342
If you want to quit...

943
01:43:32,755 --> 01:43:35,441
"You are a good doctor,
you can find work anywhere"

944
01:43:36,599 --> 01:43:40,050
"These days, to earn money,
doctors even go abroad"

945
01:43:42,365 --> 01:43:45,685
I didn't resign for the sake of going
abroad or to mint money elsewhere

946
01:43:46,849 --> 01:43:50,201
Then why?
- You know it

947
01:43:51,558 --> 01:43:54,211
"Look, Akash and Neha
should never intrude..."

948
01:43:54,568 --> 01:43:57,539
in the careers of Dr Akash Sinha
and Dr Neha Mathur

949
01:43:57,997 --> 01:44:00,235
Neha and Dr Mathur are two different
names of the same person

950
01:44:00,623 --> 01:44:02,960
Were Akash and Dr Akash Sinha
two different identities...

951
01:44:03,185 --> 01:44:05,326
you wouldn't have had to sleep
in the office last night

952
01:44:05,748 --> 01:44:08,620
That's my problem.
You are not concerned

953
01:44:09,016 --> 01:44:12,150
"I'm concerned. As long as I am here,
this problem stays with you"

954
01:44:12,570 --> 01:44:15,989
Your wife has a complex...
- I can't hear you criticise her

955
01:44:16,383 --> 01:44:20,795
"However she might be, she is my wife.
None can criticise her, especially you"

956
01:44:25,928 --> 01:44:28,167
Now I don't regret my loneliness

957
01:44:29,452 --> 01:44:32,652
"After all, you have expressed
your love towards someone"

958
01:44:34,064 --> 01:44:35,975
At least you are keeping one promise

959
01:44:37,844 --> 01:44:41,940
"To whom I am expressing my love,
and what promise I'm keeping..."

960
01:44:42,905 --> 01:44:46,258
"I don't think you understand, Neha.
It's all right"

961
01:44:47,774 --> 01:44:53,081
I guess it's better that you go away.
For you and for me too

962
01:44:55,686 --> 01:44:57,313
The patient at room 15 fainted

963
01:44:59,242 --> 01:45:01,480
"Neha, it's a case of bleeding tumour"

964
01:45:08,851 --> 01:45:11,090
"Doctor, look what's happened to him!"

965
01:45:11,734 --> 01:45:13,329
"Move, please"

966
01:45:19,806 --> 01:45:21,717
There's the tumour

967
01:45:26,149 --> 01:45:28,387
I've never seen such a tumour

968
01:45:33,547 --> 01:45:35,753
"Be brave, sister.
Everything will be all right"

969
01:45:36,111 --> 01:45:38,983
"Neha, this surgery might last
for another eight hours or so"

970
01:45:56,675 --> 01:46:00,027
"Pulse rate is dropping, Akash.
- I need some more time"

971
01:46:03,626 --> 01:46:05,537
Lord help!

972
01:46:08,431 --> 01:46:11,565
I can't believe we did it.
We did it

973
01:46:15,542 --> 01:46:18,195
Doctor...?
- The operation was successful

974
01:46:18,681 --> 01:46:21,553
"No need to worry.
- Thank you very much, doctor"

975
01:46:28,611 --> 01:46:31,483
I can't believe the operation
was successful

976
01:46:32,455 --> 01:46:34,366
Pradhan literally made it back

977
01:46:38,669 --> 01:46:41,738
"Neha, should there be such
a situation again..."

978
01:46:42,064 --> 01:46:43,659
"Yes, again!"

979
01:46:47,349 --> 01:46:51,926
Don't you feel you shouldn't quit
this surgical team and this hospital?

980
01:46:52,794 --> 01:46:56,475
Tell me honestly
- As of now I think I shouldn't

981
01:46:57,247 --> 01:47:02,041
What about the resignation letter?
- Dump it

982
01:47:05,128 --> 01:47:08,000
I'll go home and sleep.
You should do that too

983
01:47:08,971 --> 01:47:12,236
I still have lots to do.
Not everyone is as lucky as you

984
01:47:25,435 --> 01:47:28,188
Where is my wife?
- She went to her father last night

985
01:47:29,824 --> 01:47:32,030
"Give me the telephone diary...
no, it's okay"

986
01:47:32,450 --> 01:47:35,235
"Shall I serve the food, sir?
- Not now, later"

987
01:48:01,824 --> 01:48:03,102
Tired?

988
01:48:09,671 --> 01:48:11,583
"No Baba, I'm fine"

989
01:48:15,501 --> 01:48:17,707
Today you gave someone
a new lease of life

990
01:48:18,160 --> 01:48:20,716
"But Baba, had Neha
not been with me..."

991
01:48:21,171 --> 01:48:23,727
I wouldn't have been that confident
performing that operation

992
01:48:24,246 --> 01:48:26,485
Good you stopped her

993
01:48:28,890 --> 01:48:32,309
lt'd have been better
had you made her your life partner

994
01:48:34,816 --> 01:48:38,136
"But it didn't happen that way,
and it hurts"

995
01:48:47,757 --> 01:48:49,864
I called you to say goodbye

996
01:48:51,089 --> 01:48:54,671
"Not only your life,
I'm leaving this world too"

997
01:48:57,239 --> 01:48:59,151
Where are you?
- At home

998
01:48:59,994 --> 01:49:02,102
Don't bother to come

999
01:49:03,133 --> 01:49:06,519
"Because by the time you arrive,
I'd have left"

1000
01:49:38,881 --> 01:49:41,753
What kind of a doctor are you?
You can't tell a nail polish

1001
01:49:44,006 --> 01:49:46,179
"What madness is this, Sonia?
- Madness?"

1002
01:49:46,632 --> 01:49:50,411
I only wanted to see
whether you love me truly or not

1003
01:49:51,053 --> 01:49:53,925
Is this how you put someone to test?

1004
01:49:56,594 --> 01:50:01,301
The way you darted in
and called me out to me! Sonia!

1005
01:50:01,944 --> 01:50:07,132
And the way you embraced me
showed that you love me truly

1006
01:50:08,671 --> 01:50:11,543
"I'm sorry Akash.
I was out of my mind, I suspected you"

1007
01:50:22,573 --> 01:50:24,997
No more fights.
Time for love

1008
01:50:25,391 --> 01:50:30,382
Watch how I treat you everyday
when you return home from work

1009
01:50:31,221 --> 01:50:35,382
"I'll tell you some things,
I'll seduce you..."

1010
01:50:36,539 --> 01:50:41,016
and rid you of all your problems
and worries

1011
01:50:42,624 --> 01:50:44,699
"Lonely is the night..."

1012
01:50:45,955 --> 01:50:47,867
That's how it is going to be like
every night

1013
01:50:50,408 --> 01:50:52,319
So you think I can't do that?

1014
01:50:53,899 --> 01:50:56,390
"Hang on, I'll show you"

1015
01:50:57,103 --> 01:50:59,014
Close your eyes

1016
01:51:34,324 --> 01:51:36,628
"My heart tells you..."

1017
01:51:37,079 --> 01:51:38,991
"be only mine"

1018
01:51:39,577 --> 01:51:41,237
"Else..."

1019
01:51:41,884 --> 01:51:43,795
"You get it?"

1020
01:52:02,064 --> 01:52:03,976
"Now that love..."

1021
01:52:04,370 --> 01:52:06,281
"has led us here..."

1022
01:52:06,869 --> 01:52:09,905
"let's become one in body and soul
...know what I mean?"

1023
01:52:10,296 --> 01:52:12,884
"My heart tells you..."

1024
01:52:13,275 --> 01:52:15,186
"be only mine"

1025
01:52:15,518 --> 01:52:17,429
"Else..."

1026
01:52:18,400 --> 01:52:20,312
"Know what I mean?"

1027
01:53:02,316 --> 01:53:05,483
"All I want you to do is..."

1028
01:53:05,872 --> 01:53:09,705
"love me every moment"

1029
01:53:11,253 --> 01:53:14,322
"That I'm pretty..."

1030
01:53:15,097 --> 01:53:18,930
"make me realise every moment"

1031
01:53:21,022 --> 01:53:23,097
"Hold me in your heart"

1032
01:53:23,746 --> 01:53:25,471
"Call me closer"

1033
01:53:25,827 --> 01:53:29,092
"Look at me forever
...know what I mean?"

1034
01:53:29,671 --> 01:53:31,942
"My heart tells you..."

1035
01:53:32,394 --> 01:53:34,306
"be only mine"

1036
01:53:34,636 --> 01:53:36,547
"Else..."

1037
01:53:37,199 --> 01:53:39,111
"You get it?"

1038
01:54:12,434 --> 01:54:15,219
"How do I tell you..."

1039
01:54:15,765 --> 01:54:19,795
"what passions rise within me?"

1040
01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:28,632
"You are the reason I'm on a high"

1041
01:54:29,411 --> 01:54:33,244
"I'm sleepless"

1042
01:54:34,857 --> 01:54:37,347
"I'm restless"

1043
01:54:38,092 --> 01:54:40,003
"Privacy is tempting"

1044
01:54:40,430 --> 01:54:43,848
"Let's bridge this gap
...know what I mean?"

1045
01:54:44,242 --> 01:54:46,153
"My heart tells you..."

1046
01:54:46,772 --> 01:54:48,684
"be only mine"

1047
01:54:49,271 --> 01:54:51,183
"Else..."

1048
01:54:51,737 --> 01:54:53,649
"You get it?"

1049
01:54:57,279 --> 01:54:59,190
"Now that love..."

1050
01:54:59,746 --> 01:55:01,570
"has led us here..."

1051
01:55:01,827 --> 01:55:04,317
"let's become one in body and soul
...know what I mean?"

1052
01:55:05,767 --> 01:55:08,006
"My heart tells you..."

1053
01:55:10,572 --> 01:55:12,483
"be only mine"

1054
01:55:14,256 --> 01:55:15,981
"Else..."

1055
01:55:16,434 --> 01:55:18,346
"You get it?"

1056
01:55:18,805 --> 01:55:20,562
"Get it?"

1057
01:55:31,873 --> 01:55:34,429
I want a reward.
- What do you want?

1058
01:55:37,735 --> 01:55:40,520
What's that?
- Two tickets to SwitZerland

1059
01:55:40,970 --> 01:55:45,644
We're flying tomorrow.
There's a lovely city. Lausanne

1060
01:55:46,929 --> 01:55:48,840
"Only I and you, for a fortnight"

1061
01:55:49,170 --> 01:55:53,103
"No Sonia, no going anywhere. I have
nine operations in the next 15 days"

1062
01:55:53,527 --> 01:55:55,384
When did you buy the tickets?
You didn't even tell me

1063
01:55:55,577 --> 01:55:58,133
You should've at least asked me.
Strange. Cancel them

1064
01:56:00,382 --> 01:56:04,030
"All right, I'll cancel these
and buy three tickets instead"

1065
01:56:05,571 --> 01:56:06,783
Three tickets?

1066
01:56:08,390 --> 01:56:11,262
"One for Neha too.
Now you will go, won't you?"

1067
01:56:16,719 --> 01:56:19,209
Aren't you ashamed
to say such a thing?

1068
01:56:22,228 --> 01:56:27,284
Such a thing? Did I ask you
what you and Neha were discussing...

1069
01:56:27,673 --> 01:56:34,325
in the garden early morning? Or did
I ask you what you talked all night?

1070
01:56:34,977 --> 01:56:36,702
Did I?

1071
01:56:42,023 --> 01:56:45,060
You are so narrow-minded!
And your thoughts are so filthy

1072
01:56:45,707 --> 01:56:48,098
"You are not,
but I am ashamed of it"

1073
01:56:52,274 --> 01:56:54,895
So I'm narrow-minded

1074
01:56:59,001 --> 01:57:03,478
"I'm not filthy, you are!
You and your Neha Mathur!"

1075
01:57:10,789 --> 01:57:12,252
"Sir, I need to talk to you"

1076
01:57:14,472 --> 01:57:18,021
"I have ordered the MRI machine that
your hospital needs, from Germany"

1077
01:57:22,064 --> 01:57:24,936
You'll find the machine there when
you go to the hospital tomorrow

1078
01:57:25,331 --> 01:57:27,438
"Sir, I..."

1079
01:57:32,314 --> 01:57:34,552
"I won't ever divorce you! Never!
- I understand, Akash"

1080
01:57:36,478 --> 01:57:38,203
I'll talk to Sonia

1081
01:57:47,208 --> 01:57:50,889
"Don't do this, my child. If you
do this, he'll leave you"

1082
01:57:53,015 --> 01:57:53,964
Followed?

1083
01:58:30,748 --> 01:58:33,621
Akash? Come home at once

1084
01:58:34,015 --> 01:58:36,057
Hurry up

1085
01:58:40,358 --> 01:58:42,979
I shouldn't have told Sonia
that Akash would leave her

1086
01:58:43,497 --> 01:58:45,059
I shouldn't have

1087
01:59:11,813 --> 01:59:16,936
Sonia was eight years old
when I and her mother divorced

1088
01:59:18,699 --> 01:59:25,416
Like a football she was kicked around
between me and her mother

1089
01:59:27,189 --> 01:59:28,619
Then Sheila...

1090
01:59:33,915 --> 01:59:36,788
"Someone else came into her life,
and they married"

1091
01:59:38,816 --> 01:59:41,918
"And for the poor little girl,
her mother's door was shut forever"

1092
01:59:43,140 --> 01:59:45,247
"And I, her father..."

1093
01:59:47,080 --> 01:59:53,448
"I had money, lots,
but I had no time. No time"

1094
01:59:55,056 --> 01:59:57,547
I bought her everything
that she asked for

1095
02:00:01,590 --> 02:00:06,581
"But, did I ever tell her
a bedtime story?"

1096
02:00:11,393 --> 02:00:15,805
Did I ever carry her lovingly
to the park? No

1097
02:00:17,286 --> 02:00:20,672
"I realise it now,
but those times are lost"

1098
02:00:21,963 --> 02:00:24,836
"And now, she doesn't even believe
that someone would ever love her"

1099
02:00:25,295 --> 02:00:27,402
She is raging within

1100
02:00:43,104 --> 02:00:45,016
You may have your dinner

1101
02:01:08,089 --> 02:01:09,498
What's this?

1102
02:01:32,881 --> 02:01:36,333
"I understand, Neha.
Not that I don't"

1103
02:01:39,192 --> 02:01:44,282
It is not that those who keep smiling
don't really know what sorrow is

1104
02:01:46,528 --> 02:01:50,044
"But Neha, sorrows can be forgotten"

1105
02:01:55,176 --> 02:01:57,863
What do you say?
- What do I say?

1106
02:01:59,981 --> 02:02:03,815
"Life is not about turning back,
it is about moving ahead"

1107
02:02:04,945 --> 02:02:09,587
That's true and that's important.
And you got to do just that

1108
02:02:13,435 --> 02:02:17,595
"I guess you are right.
- Then think, Neha, and heed me"

1109
02:02:24,966 --> 02:02:29,248
I don't trust my thoughts anymore.
I'd rather agree with you

1110
02:02:33,615 --> 02:02:40,332
"Neha, before I go craZy with joy,
wash my hands, please"

1111
02:02:45,530 --> 02:02:47,442
"Sonia is fine now, isn't she?"

1112
02:02:49,150 --> 02:02:53,376
"I think if you stay back for some
more days, it'd be good"

1113
02:02:56,678 --> 02:02:58,589
I got an important meeting

1114
02:03:18,780 --> 02:03:22,362
What will you have? Tea? Coffee?
- Give me some beer

1115
02:03:23,072 --> 02:03:25,213
I bring great news.
- Break it at once

1116
02:03:25,507 --> 02:03:27,232
I'm marrying

1117
02:03:27,621 --> 02:03:29,346
Really? Great

1118
02:03:30,312 --> 02:03:31,655
Who is she?

1119
02:03:34,283 --> 02:03:36,073
Dr Neha Mathur

1120
02:03:44,854 --> 02:03:48,567
When is the wedding?
- The date's not fixed as yet

1121
02:03:48,954 --> 02:03:51,771
My parents are coming. But I'm
throwing a small party tomorrow

1122
02:03:53,694 --> 02:03:56,567
Are you really interested
in marrying Sanjay?

1123
02:04:51,032 --> 02:04:54,232
"But the ice isn't here as yet.
Go, look up"

1124
02:04:56,477 --> 02:04:58,716
Neha... you? So early?

1125
02:05:00,642 --> 02:05:02,553
I want to talk to you

1126
02:05:05,703 --> 02:05:08,007
Tell me. What is it?

1127
02:05:15,696 --> 02:05:17,422
I can't marry you

1128
02:05:30,143 --> 02:05:33,310
It was a vulnerable moment
when I agreed

1129
02:05:33,730 --> 02:05:35,641
But this relationship
would be nothing but a farce

1130
02:05:36,677 --> 02:05:39,462
I can't cheat you
and myself

1131
02:05:41,002 --> 02:05:43,393
I don't want you to cheat yourself

1132
02:05:47,152 --> 02:05:52,110
What I wanted
...could not happen

1133
02:05:55,416 --> 02:05:57,655
I'll grieve over it for some time

1134
02:05:58,299 --> 02:06:00,211
But it can't be helped

1135
02:06:02,911 --> 02:06:04,823
I must appreciate your decision

1136
02:06:05,506 --> 02:06:12,966
"Sanjay, I feel sorry that you
informed your family and friends"

1137
02:06:14,155 --> 02:06:16,361
They should be here any moment now

1138
02:06:17,006 --> 02:06:21,353
You are in a spot because of me
- Don't bother

1139
02:06:23,508 --> 02:06:25,845
People will talk for some time
and then forget

1140
02:06:28,345 --> 02:06:30,649
Who has the time to remember
our misfortune?

1141
02:06:38,723 --> 02:06:41,213
I'm going to Delhi tonight.
These are Neha's mother's reports

1142
02:06:41,606 --> 02:06:43,463
Would you deliver them?
- What happened to her?

1143
02:06:43,624 --> 02:06:45,054
Abdominal tumour

1144
02:06:48,076 --> 02:06:49,988
Better if the surgery is done soon

1145
02:06:51,280 --> 02:06:53,191
"All right, I'll deliver it"

1146
02:07:05,663 --> 02:07:07,158
What happened?

1147
02:07:07,968 --> 02:07:09,399
What happened?

1148
02:07:11,396 --> 02:07:13,252
"You know it, sweetie"

1149
02:07:14,022 --> 02:07:17,091
"Tell me, why did it happen?
- I don't understand"

1150
02:07:19,981 --> 02:07:22,667
Sanjay's wedding with Neha
has been called off

1151
02:07:24,786 --> 02:07:26,129
Really?

1152
02:07:28,630 --> 02:07:30,541
What do I say?

1153
02:07:31,064 --> 02:07:35,029
You could say something. You must've
told Neha and Sanjay something...

1154
02:07:35,356 --> 02:07:37,081
due to which the wedding
was called off

1155
02:07:37,278 --> 02:07:38,228
"Tea, sir?"

1156
02:07:44,966 --> 02:07:49,193
"Sonia, I had nothing to do in it.
Don't get into arguments with me"

1157
02:07:50,411 --> 02:07:52,322
I don't want to talk about Neha

1158
02:08:08,349 --> 02:08:10,904
Who is it?
- Mrs Mathur

1159
02:08:11,873 --> 02:08:14,046
Greetings aunt.
- Greetings

1160
02:08:14,499 --> 02:08:19,556
"Aunt, why don't you ask Neha
to stop flitting about?"

1161
02:08:20,745 --> 02:08:23,399
"When he's willing to marry,
why doesn't she marry him?"

1162
02:08:24,117 --> 02:08:25,328
Who are you?

1163
02:08:26,487 --> 02:08:32,243
"If Neha doesn't stop flirting with
Akash, I'll throw acid on her face"

1164
02:08:34,303 --> 02:08:37,622
Are you listening? Acid!
I'll make life miserable for her

1165
02:08:38,275 --> 02:08:41,540
"I'll mar her face!
I'll have her murdered, and you too"

1166
02:08:42,887 --> 02:08:44,098
You dig?

1167
02:09:22,543 --> 02:09:25,415
The fall has fractured the tumour.
The surgery has to be done at once

1168
02:09:26,067 --> 02:09:28,371
For that we need her CAT scan
and X-ray reports

1169
02:09:28,629 --> 02:09:30,868
It's impossible otherwise.
- I just spoke to Dr Joshi

1170
02:09:31,352 --> 02:09:34,289
He said he gave all the reports
to Dr Sinha before leaving for Delhi

1171
02:09:34,522 --> 02:09:35,931
Get them at once.
- Okay

1172
02:09:57,938 --> 02:09:59,696
Allow me

1173
02:10:08,669 --> 02:10:11,868
"Sonia, Neha here. Please give
the phone to Akash, quick"

1174
02:10:12,320 --> 02:10:15,073
He's not home.
Try his cellphone

1175
02:10:15,588 --> 02:10:17,379
It's switched off.
- I can't help it

1176
02:10:27,568 --> 02:10:29,480
Who was it?
- It was for Dad

1177
02:10:39,196 --> 02:10:41,587
Found the reports?
- Not here

1178
02:10:41,983 --> 02:10:45,117
New tests will take time.
- He could've taken them home

1179
02:10:45,570 --> 02:10:47,744
He's not at home.
- The reports could be at home

1180
02:10:48,132 --> 02:10:50,044
I'll go and check

1181
02:10:53,514 --> 02:10:54,944
Got it

1182
02:10:55,595 --> 02:10:58,468
"Sonia, you're getting
addicted to it. It's bad"

1183
02:11:00,241 --> 02:11:01,835
I only take one pill

1184
02:11:07,672 --> 02:11:09,529
"Sonia, Neha here"

1185
02:11:10,811 --> 02:11:11,827
Who?

1186
02:11:12,156 --> 02:11:13,947
Ram Singh? One minute

1187
02:11:21,414 --> 02:11:22,560
"Yes Neha, I'm listening"

1188
02:11:23,784 --> 02:11:25,695
Where is Akash?
- I don't know

1189
02:11:26,187 --> 02:11:28,098
My Ma is very serious.
Her operation...

1190
02:11:28,268 --> 02:11:30,988
"As you know, Akash has
so many girlfriends"

1191
02:11:31,632 --> 02:11:33,543
I don't know who he is with now

1192
02:11:38,102 --> 02:11:40,592
"What is it, Ram Singh?
- Coffee for the master"

1193
02:11:41,562 --> 02:11:43,473
Keep it here

1194
02:11:54,055 --> 02:11:56,708
Watchman! Watchman!
- Yes madam?

1195
02:11:57,033 --> 02:12:00,649
We're sleeping. Don't open
the gate for anyone. Get it?

1196
02:12:01,005 --> 02:12:01,954
Yes madam

1197
02:12:34,159 --> 02:12:36,714
"Sanjay, where is Neha?
- Where were you last night?"

1198
02:12:37,041 --> 02:12:38,570
What do you mean?

1199
02:12:39,251 --> 02:12:42,768
"Where were you last night, Akash?
- At home, I mean at Sonia's father's"

1200
02:12:43,095 --> 02:12:46,164
Neha tried to contact you several
times. Sonia said you weren't there

1201
02:12:46,843 --> 02:12:50,108
Then I came there myself.
Your watchman wouldn't let me in

1202
02:12:50,462 --> 02:12:53,312
What are you talking?
- At least you should've realised...

1203
02:12:53,634 --> 02:12:57,151
"that the poor woman's CAT scan, X-rays
...all the reports were with you"

1204
02:12:57,478 --> 02:12:59,389
Neha's mother's reports?
I'm here to give that

1205
02:12:59,528 --> 02:13:02,378
"Akash, Neha's mother
passed away last night"

1206
02:13:05,934 --> 02:13:08,686
The abdominal tumour ruptured.
We didn't have the reports...

1207
02:13:09,009 --> 02:13:10,921
the surgery got delayed
and she died

1208
02:13:31,880 --> 02:13:35,713
"Neha kept calling last night,
and you didn't even tell me? Why?"

1209
02:13:36,044 --> 02:13:38,600
Dammit! Early in the morning?

1210
02:13:39,896 --> 02:13:44,123
You were too tired.
I didn't want her to disturb you

1211
02:13:44,509 --> 02:13:46,485
Last night Neha's mother died

1212
02:13:54,086 --> 02:13:58,792
It was Neha's mother who died.
Why are you so upset?

1213
02:13:59,307 --> 02:14:02,212
Upset? Why am I upset?

1214
02:14:02,767 --> 02:14:05,322
It's beyond a self-centered
girl's comprehension

1215
02:14:05,650 --> 02:14:08,915
"But there are people who grieve
over other's sorrows, you see"

1216
02:14:10,455 --> 02:14:14,233
"She wasn't just Neha's mother,
she was also a patient in my hospital"

1217
02:14:14,555 --> 02:14:17,427
And to save her was the duty
of every doctor in the hospital

1218
02:14:20,128 --> 02:14:26,725
"Sonia, because of you
I feel responsible for her death"

1219
02:14:27,815 --> 02:14:30,305
"She is dead, period.
What have I done?"

1220
02:14:31,659 --> 02:14:35,274
"What happened till date
was all your doing, Sonia"

1221
02:14:36,368 --> 02:14:37,995
It is my turn now

1222
02:14:39,540 --> 02:14:41,451
What can you do?

1223
02:14:46,971 --> 02:14:51,832
You are right.
You are one of them...

1224
02:14:52,224 --> 02:14:54,593
who consider other's decency
a weakness...

1225
02:14:54,915 --> 02:14:56,826
"and their patience, cowardice"

1226
02:14:57,990 --> 02:15:01,638
I tried my best
and I tried honestly

1227
02:15:01,961 --> 02:15:05,161
"But I can't stay a second more
with a rude, self-centered..."

1228
02:15:05,486 --> 02:15:08,620
and an eccentric girl like you.
I'm walking out of your life

1229
02:15:14,967 --> 02:15:17,522
"I'm Gulshan Kapoor's daughter,
Sonia Kapoor"

1230
02:15:17,849 --> 02:15:22,131
I can destroy you and your hospital
...in a snap

1231
02:15:30,471 --> 02:15:33,026
You destroyed me and my hospital
the very moment...

1232
02:15:33,353 --> 02:15:36,553
when a woman died
without surgery

1233
02:15:37,197 --> 02:15:40,397
"If I stay any longer here,
what is left too will be destroyed"

1234
02:15:43,026 --> 02:15:46,478
Where are you going? To Neha?
I won't let you go to her

1235
02:15:46,807 --> 02:15:50,007
You are right. I drop you.
I'm going to Neha

1236
02:15:53,213 --> 02:15:56,413
You think I'll give you a divorce?

1237
02:15:57,281 --> 02:15:59,870
Never! I'll never divorce you

1238
02:16:05,065 --> 02:16:09,379
"Don't leave me... don't!
I'll die, Akash"

1239
02:16:09,870 --> 02:16:11,781
Die then! Die

1240
02:16:13,714 --> 02:16:16,586
No! You can't leave me

1241
02:16:17,333 --> 02:16:18,895
I'm Sonia Kapoor

1242
02:16:19,287 --> 02:16:20,236
Akash!

1243
02:16:34,662 --> 02:16:38,375
"You can't do this to me, Akash.
Please don't leave me"

1244
02:16:38,699 --> 02:16:42,347
I won't harass you anymore

1245
02:16:58,686 --> 02:17:00,793
"What happened, my child?"

1246
02:17:01,666 --> 02:17:02,714
What happened?

1247
02:17:05,477 --> 02:17:07,137
I'll see you again in the evening

1248
02:17:51,539 --> 02:17:53,450
"Where were you, Akash?"

1249
02:17:56,344 --> 02:17:58,615
Where were you?
Where?

1250
02:18:13,417 --> 02:18:18,310
"Sonia, I'll summon up all my lawyers.
It was a civil marriage, not a joke"

1251
02:18:18,862 --> 02:18:22,478
What does he think of himself?
Don't you worry

1252
02:18:22,802 --> 02:18:29,300
Your father is with you.
- I thought you'd back him even now

1253
02:18:30,233 --> 02:18:32,657
I always backed him
and reasoned with you

1254
02:18:33,053 --> 02:18:38,722
How dare he tells my daughter to
kill herself? How dare he say that?

1255
02:18:39,107 --> 02:18:42,820
"I'll have him flayed alive in court!
Die, eh?"

1256
02:18:43,431 --> 02:18:45,735
I feel like putting a bullet
through Akash right now!

1257
02:19:05,597 --> 02:19:06,875
I've decided

1258
02:19:10,530 --> 02:19:12,540
Don't get carried away
and take such decisions

1259
02:19:17,385 --> 02:19:22,573
"It's over now. On my way here,
I severed all ties"

1260
02:19:42,978 --> 02:19:45,250
"Yes Dr Ahmed?
Go on, I'm listening"

1261
02:19:52,556 --> 02:19:53,768
"Now what, Akash?"

1262
02:19:57,521 --> 02:20:00,012
The accident has seriously
injured Sonia in the head

1263
02:20:04,151 --> 02:20:06,258
Surgery.
There's no other way out

1264
02:20:07,963 --> 02:20:11,382
"But as Jamil Ahmed said,
there is so much damage..."

1265
02:20:12,993 --> 02:20:15,865
that the chances of a successful
operation is only five percent

1266
02:20:16,900 --> 02:20:18,276
Five percent

1267
02:20:20,456 --> 02:20:24,071
Sonia wrecked your life

1268
02:20:25,389 --> 02:20:29,070
Only a miracle can save her today

1269
02:20:30,418 --> 02:20:36,053
"If you refuse to perform this surgery,
as a doctor, you won't be condemned"

1270
02:20:38,330 --> 02:20:43,420
"But if you do perform the surgery,
and if it fails..."

1271
02:20:44,448 --> 02:20:48,347
and Sonia dies on table...
more chances of that happening

1272
02:20:50,374 --> 02:20:52,384
then people will talk

1273
02:20:53,929 --> 02:20:55,818
You will be accused

1274
02:20:57,037 --> 02:21:01,580
You will be sued on charges
that to get rid of your wife...!

1275
02:21:06,614 --> 02:21:08,820
Your medical career will be ruined

1276
02:21:09,625 --> 02:21:13,524
"You won't be able to perform
anymore surgeries, for life"

1277
02:21:18,914 --> 02:21:22,333
"But Akash, if you don't
perform the surgery..."

1278
02:21:23,975 --> 02:21:26,344
you won't be able to forgive yourself

1279
02:21:28,652 --> 02:21:32,748
"Akash Sinha, what must you do
at this point of time?"

1280
02:21:33,585 --> 02:21:38,194
No one can decide but you.
Not even I

1281
02:21:43,995 --> 02:21:46,965
"What happened, Akash?
- Sonia is in the hospital"

1282
02:21:47,326 --> 02:21:51,007
She'll die if she's not operated.
I'm going to perform this surgery

1283
02:21:51,972 --> 02:21:55,390
"Dr Neha Mathur, I need you.
Would you come?"

1284
02:22:35,920 --> 02:22:37,579
Where is Dr Jamil Ahmed?

1285
02:22:39,059 --> 02:22:41,931
Where is my daughter Sonia Kapoor?
- On the operation table

1286
02:22:43,062 --> 02:22:46,229
Akash Sinha.
- Stop this operation!

1287
02:22:46,553 --> 02:22:49,623
That doctor will kill my daughter.
Stop the surgery!

1288
02:22:49,917 --> 02:22:52,058
"Sorry, the operation has begun.
Can't stop it"

1289
02:22:57,893 --> 02:22:59,870
Blood. Get four pints

1290
02:23:00,744 --> 02:23:03,081
The injury damaged a blood vessel

1291
02:23:03,915 --> 02:23:09,966
The blood has gathered in
three places. It's called clotting

1292
02:23:10,770 --> 02:23:16,854
"If the clots aren't removed, survival
is out of question. You understand?"

1293
02:23:18,041 --> 02:23:20,695
"Yes, I understand.
I understand that..."

1294
02:23:21,020 --> 02:23:23,641
if Akash is not kicked out of
the operation table at once...

1295
02:23:23,968 --> 02:23:26,239
my daughter's survival
is out of question

1296
02:23:27,875 --> 02:23:30,398
"I want to fly Sonia to London,
America, Germany..."

1297
02:23:30,726 --> 02:23:34,024
"to the best hospital,
to the best doctor, anywhere"

1298
02:23:44,308 --> 02:23:45,586
Glass pieces

1299
02:23:47,094 --> 02:23:49,584
Must remove them very carefully

1300
02:23:50,906 --> 02:23:53,364
The slightest of damage
to the brain could...!

1301
02:23:59,042 --> 02:24:01,051
Move!
- You can't go in

1302
02:24:02,566 --> 02:24:03,942
Who will stop me?

1303
02:24:07,595 --> 02:24:10,347
Police? I'm the one who's going
to call the police

1304
02:24:10,670 --> 02:24:15,693
"The man who wants my daughter to die,
who asked her to kill herself..."

1305
02:24:16,116 --> 02:24:18,354
how dare he operates my daughter?

1306
02:24:20,824 --> 02:24:22,736
This vein is damaged

1307
02:24:28,608 --> 02:24:30,880
Pulse rate has dropped too low.
Akash...

1308
02:24:31,202 --> 02:24:33,626
you will have to stop the surgery
for a while

1309
02:25:36,664 --> 02:25:39,000
"Your daughter is perfectly all right,
and absolutely safe"

1310
02:25:40,797 --> 02:25:43,035
Can I see Sonia?
- After a while

1311
02:25:43,615 --> 02:25:48,803
"Sonia's CAT scan and X-rays.
America, London, Germany..."

1312
02:25:49,605 --> 02:25:52,095
"or anywhere,
show it to the best doctor"

1313
02:25:52,424 --> 02:25:55,776
And he will tell you
how this Hindustani doctor...

1314
02:25:56,108 --> 02:25:58,860
saved your daughter
from the jaws of death

1315
02:26:49,025 --> 02:26:52,094
For the first time after two months
I have ventured out of the house

1316
02:26:54,983 --> 02:26:57,440
You are perfectly all right

1317
02:26:58,794 --> 02:27:02,092
"All right, I never was,
and I can never be"

1318
02:27:03,119 --> 02:27:05,357
"Yes, your surgery was perfect"

1319
02:27:06,481 --> 02:27:10,347
Dad told me
how Neha and you saved my life

1320
02:27:11,127 --> 02:27:15,059
"Well, now that one problem is solved,
I got another"

1321
02:27:15,932 --> 02:27:17,843
Please be seated.
Would you have something?

1322
02:27:21,473 --> 02:27:25,251
I'm still legally your wife. And
no one is so formal with his wife...

1323
02:27:25,573 --> 02:27:27,746
"Please be seated.
Would you have something?"

1324
02:27:30,346 --> 02:27:33,415
You were right when you said
you can never be all right

1325
02:27:33,742 --> 02:27:38,503
And I don't want to. Know what?
I've been thinking seriously of late

1326
02:27:38,995 --> 02:27:42,828
"And I figure one thing,
that we... you and I..."

1327
02:27:43,927 --> 02:27:47,957
"how do I put it?
Take for instance, music"

1328
02:27:49,501 --> 02:27:54,689
"If life is a melody, the two of us
are singing it in different tunes"

1329
02:27:56,163 --> 02:27:58,784
And that's why
we can't sing it together

1330
02:27:59,207 --> 02:28:02,690
"Sonia, when did you start
preaching sentimental stuff?"

1331
02:28:05,709 --> 02:28:11,344
"Ever since you operated upon my brain,
it's been working overtime"

1332
02:28:15,383 --> 02:28:17,424
Here you are.
- What's that?

1333
02:28:19,355 --> 02:28:21,364
Take it.
- But what is it?

1334
02:28:22,238 --> 02:28:24,607
Divorce papers.
I have signed them

1335
02:28:27,043 --> 02:28:29,598
"Sonia...
- Different tunes, you see"

1336
02:28:30,630 --> 02:28:34,409
"But... but...
- Look, hide the papers soon"

1337
02:28:34,730 --> 02:28:36,642
Or I'll take them back

1338
02:28:39,663 --> 02:28:41,574
I'm going to London next week

1339
02:28:42,129 --> 02:28:44,619
"And then, on a world tour
with my college friends"

1340
02:28:45,076 --> 02:28:50,100
I'll go around the world.
Who knows if we'd meet again or not!

1341
02:28:51,963 --> 02:28:57,915
"Sonia, perhaps you and I were
not made for each other"

1342
02:29:01,413 --> 02:29:03,324
But you will always be on my mind

1343
02:29:04,424 --> 02:29:06,882
Who can forget me?
And how can you forget me?

1344
02:29:10,061 --> 02:29:11,656
I'll see you off

1345
02:29:18,389 --> 02:29:19,700
Go in

1346
02:29:21,817 --> 02:29:23,958
"Be cheerful, stay happy"

1347
02:29:26,398 --> 02:29:28,287
"Exactly, that's my programme"

1348
02:30:26,073 --> 02:30:28,661
"Desires"

1349
02:30:31,743 --> 02:30:33,567
"How desires make you dream..."

1350
02:30:33,889 --> 02:30:35,615
"how they torment you..."

1351
02:30:35,939 --> 02:30:39,652
"no one knows"

1352
02:30:42,313 --> 02:30:44,225
"Let's sing together..."

1353
02:30:44,588 --> 02:30:46,532
"and paint the town in red"

1354
02:30:47,118 --> 02:30:48,745
"Let's sing together..."

1355
02:30:49,072 --> 02:30:51,944
"and paint the town in red"

1356
02:31:18,670 --> 02:31:20,646
"This newfound happiness..."

1357
02:31:20,976 --> 02:31:22,734
"daZes me"

1358
02:31:23,058 --> 02:31:25,264
"This is some stuff..."

1359
02:31:25,588 --> 02:31:29,815
"I never expected"

1360
02:31:32,315 --> 02:31:34,139
"Expectations? No big deal"

1361
02:31:34,430 --> 02:31:36,701
"What is writ shall only happen"

1362
02:31:37,024 --> 02:31:38,913
"Whoever knew..."

1363
02:31:39,235 --> 02:31:43,167
"what life holds?"

1364
02:31:43,944 --> 02:31:45,287
"My desires..."

1365
02:31:45,737 --> 02:31:47,561
"like raging storms..."

1366
02:31:47,883 --> 02:31:52,678
"rise within me...
yet living is much easier now"
