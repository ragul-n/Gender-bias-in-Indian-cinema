00:00:52,328 --> 00:00:54,848
Abdul, serve two glasses of cold water
at number 3.

4
00:00:54,928 --> 00:00:56,928
Also give cup of tea and biscuits.

5

Ok, sir! Take 5 rupees from him.

00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:02,848
3 rupees 20 paisa from the next one.
Then 2 rupees.

00:01:02,928 --> 00:01:04,728
Yes, sir. What do you want?
Curry, mutton..

8
00:01:04,808 --> 00:01:09,608
- Shut up! Get me a bottle of beer.
- Beer?

9
00:01:09,968 --> 00:01:13,288
Sir, you've taken enough beer.
Now, please eat something.

10
00:01:15,798 --> 00:01:19,747
I called you here to take
down my order, is that clear?

11
00:01:19,827 --> 00:01:21,704
- Yes, sir.
- And Sheru never leaves the place..

12
00:01:21,728 --> 00:01:23,879
Till he completely
gets intoxicated. Get lost.

13
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:26,688
- Bring me one beer. Fast.. hurry up.
- Ok, sir.

14
00:01:27,336 --> 00:01:28,376
- Sir!
- What's the matter?

15
00:01:28,411 --> 00:01:30,288
He already had 8 bottles.
He wants one more.

16
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:32,951
- I hope he might not create any chaos here.
- Chaos? - Yes.

17
00:01:34,225 --> 00:01:36,208
Go and tell him that
the beer is not in stock now.

18
00:01:36,288 --> 00:01:38,491
Just pay us cash,
we'll arrange it from outside.

19
00:01:38,571 --> 00:01:40,168
Won't he kill me if I go there?

20
00:01:40,248 --> 00:01:42,688
Just go! Why are you so scared? Go!

21
00:01:43,075 --> 00:01:45,979
- Are you there with me?
- I'm there. You please go. Go.

22
00:01:46,059 --> 00:01:47,178
Ok, boss.

23
00:01:50,141 --> 00:01:53,103
Sir, my boss says
the beer is not in stock.

24
00:01:53,518 --> 00:01:55,543
Pay us some cash we'll
arrange it from outside.

25
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,423
- Call your boss.
- Boss, sir is calling you.

26
00:02:05,244 --> 00:02:06,623
What's the matter, mister?

27
00:02:13,126 --> 00:02:15,023
- Beer is not in stock?
- Yes.

28
00:02:17,288 --> 00:02:18,823
- You want cash?
- Yes.

29
00:02:26,692 --> 00:02:30,743
Sorry, boss. I'm late. Don't worry.

30
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:33,623
I'll clear your balance.

31
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:43,129
Run!

32
00:03:29,938 --> 00:03:34,543
- I'll see you. I won't spare you.
- Oh, c'mon.

33
00:03:34,623 --> 00:03:37,413
Next time if you'll be seen here,
your life will be at risk.

34
00:03:37,493 --> 00:03:38,639
Go away.

35
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,844
Get lost!

36
00:03:42,186 --> 00:03:44,306
Please come! What a fight!

37
00:03:45,815 --> 00:03:48,512
- Welcome, sir!
- Start with your business.

38
00:03:48,592 --> 00:03:50,258
No chaos will be created here now.

39
00:03:50,338 --> 00:03:52,138
Henceforth I'll guard this hotel.

40
00:03:52,218 --> 00:03:55,015
Thank you, sir.
You can consider it your own hotel.

41
00:03:55,095 --> 00:03:58,229
2 meals free and 300 rupees
per month will be your salary.

42
00:03:58,309 --> 00:04:00,915
I work and earn.
I never beg for it.

43
00:04:00,995 --> 00:04:03,375
- 300, is very less.
- 400 will do? - Ok.

44
00:04:03,455 --> 00:04:04,535
Ok, fine. Take this.

45
00:04:04,806 --> 00:04:08,695
- Kalva, bring special dish for sir. Fast.
- Ok, boss.

46
00:04:10,495 --> 00:04:12,711
This is today's payment.
What about next month's advance?

47
00:04:12,735 --> 00:04:17,095
Advance? Yes, ok. I understood.

48
00:04:17,175 --> 00:04:21,135
Take this.
This is 1, 2, 3 and 4. Happy?

49
00:04:21,535 --> 00:04:23,907
- What are you looking at me? Get me a bottle of beer.
- Beer?

50
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:26,095
Beer is.. shall
I bring it from outside, boss?

51
00:04:26,175 --> 00:04:29,044
- From inside. - Ok, sir.
- What are you staring at me?

52
00:04:29,124 --> 00:04:32,695
Bring it chilled.
Please have a seat, sir. Please..

53
00:04:34,577 --> 00:04:41,501
1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8..

54
00:04:43,455 --> 00:04:46,615
Aye!?

55
00:04:48,775 --> 00:04:50,113
What are you doing?

56
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:56,095
It hurts. Are you drunk?
Stupid, I'm Vijay. Your friend.

57
00:04:56,175 --> 00:04:58,015
Had you forgotten our
friendship in the shop?

58
00:04:58,095 --> 00:04:59,335
That I'm Ajay?

59
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,705
I did that drama
to make some money.

60
00:05:01,785 --> 00:05:04,025
To hell with your drama.
You've broken my bones.

61
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,770
- I'm sorry. Did it hurt more? Show me..
- Move away.

62
00:05:06,951 --> 00:05:08,292
Now you'll spoil
the iron of my clothes.

63
00:05:08,316 --> 00:05:10,665
As it is you've spoiled me
by making me drink liquor.

64
00:05:10,963 --> 00:05:12,425
It was not liquor. It was beer.

65
00:05:12,505 --> 00:05:15,505
It must be a beer for you.
For me, it was a fireball.

66
00:05:15,585 --> 00:05:17,069
I'm still feeling hangover.

67
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:18,549
Even now your hangover is not gone?

68
00:05:37,154 --> 00:05:39,081
So many rupees?

69
00:05:39,161 --> 00:05:40,835
These are only 800 rupees.
You just see..

70
00:05:40,915 --> 00:05:42,505
How I turn it into 80000 rupees.

71
00:05:43,313 --> 00:05:44,665
Will you go to casino and gamble?

72
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:46,185
Nobody wins and
comes out from there.

73
00:05:46,244 --> 00:05:48,595
Why? Do they shoot the winner?

74
00:05:48,675 --> 00:05:51,328
Or they have made
a big gambler sit there.

75
00:05:51,408 --> 00:05:54,075
There's one person
name Asrani over there.

76
00:05:54,155 --> 00:05:57,072
He has a big mark
under his right eye.

77
00:05:57,152 --> 00:06:00,275
I'll make the same
mark under his left eye.

78
00:06:00,355 --> 00:06:02,483
Stop your joke now.
Nobody can win there.

79
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:04,835
And yes,
you need to take counters worth..

80
00:06:04,915 --> 00:06:06,275
1000's of rupees in advance.

81
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:07,965
- Of course, we'll take it.
- How?

82
00:06:08,045 --> 00:06:09,275
We've these 800 rupees.

83
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:11,074
Will you create some chaos again?

84
00:06:11,098 --> 00:06:14,641
No! You just see what I do.
Anyway, I'll go now.

85
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:17,002
- See you in the evening at casino.
- Where are you going?

86
00:06:17,738 --> 00:06:21,835
I'll.. there.. ok?

87
00:06:23,324 --> 00:06:25,595
Help! Help!

88
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,835
Help me! Help!

89
00:06:31,796 --> 00:06:32,915
Leave me!

90
00:09:10,643 --> 00:09:14,163
Excuse me! Hello! Stop!

91
00:09:16,107 --> 00:09:18,323
- Thank you very much!
- It was my..

92
00:09:21,163 --> 00:09:22,363
Do you want to say something?

93
00:09:22,443 --> 00:09:27,307
- They ran away.
- Are you working in some circus?

94
00:09:27,387 --> 00:09:30,198
- Not at all.
- Then you must be a fight master in the films.

95
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,403
No! I'm Hanuman's devotee.

96
00:09:32,483 --> 00:09:35,082
- Now I understood.
- What?

97
00:09:35,162 --> 00:09:37,288
That's why you
can jump like monkey.

98
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,288
Look, you please don't
say anything about my God.

99
00:09:39,363 --> 00:09:43,243
- No! I was telling this about you.
- Oh! Never mind.

100
00:09:43,882 --> 00:09:45,603
- What?
- You were telling me something.

101
00:09:45,683 --> 00:09:49,683
Yes. You.. please cover your shirt.

102
00:09:54,081 --> 00:09:57,523
- I'm going.
- Very strange! Won't you drop me till Taxi?

103
00:09:57,603 --> 00:10:02,363
Taxi? Yes, sure. Let's go.

104
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,803
Taxi!

105
00:10:12,415 --> 00:10:14,283
- Won't you drop me till my home?
- Home?

106
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,203
Actually,
I've some important work here.

107
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:19,963
Strange boy! He neither
asked my name, nor address.

108
00:10:20,043 --> 00:10:23,123
- Did you say anything?
- Nothing.

109
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:26,883
- I hope it's not open now.
- Driver, please drive..

110
00:10:28,532 --> 00:10:31,563
Oh! I'm such a stupid fellow.

111
00:10:32,003 --> 00:10:33,723
I neither asked her name,
nor address.

112
00:10:33,889 --> 00:10:36,044
What happens to me
with the sight of a girl?

113
00:10:36,934 --> 00:10:38,027
God..

114
00:10:58,251 --> 00:11:01,597
- Hi, buddy! How's life?
- Fine.

115
00:11:01,677 --> 00:11:03,691
Where do you live?
Nowadays you aren't seen much.

116
00:11:03,771 --> 00:11:05,891
And you've also bought new car.
Are you going to play?

117
00:11:06,263 --> 00:11:07,531
- Yes.
- I'm also going to play.

118
00:11:07,611 --> 00:11:11,286
- Ok, best of luck. Best of luck!
- Excuse me!

119
00:11:11,532 --> 00:11:15,262
- I didn't recognise you.
- What? You didn't recognise me?

120
00:11:15,701 --> 00:11:17,571
You mean you didn't
recognise me at all?

121
00:11:18,033 --> 00:11:21,411
- No!
- Let go off it. I too, didn't recognise you.

122
00:11:22,862 --> 00:11:26,251
- Move away! Just go away from here.
- Stop! Stop! Stop!

123
00:11:33,915 --> 00:11:37,131
- Blue Mercedes. Take care of it.
- Yes, sir.

124
00:11:38,971 --> 00:11:41,091
O beggar.
Now go from here. Go away.

125
00:12:00,771 --> 00:12:02,171
Why are you standing there mister?

126
00:12:02,372 --> 00:12:04,092
If you want to try
your luck then be seated.

127
00:12:04,242 --> 00:12:06,051
I never play to try my luck.

128
00:12:07,204 --> 00:12:08,971
Then play it as a hobby.

129
00:12:09,051 --> 00:12:12,811
- Playing for 5 to 10 thousand is not my hobby.
- Oh!

130
00:12:13,152 --> 00:12:14,731
Then you've come at right time.

131
00:12:15,352 --> 00:12:17,051
There's no limit on this table.

132
00:12:17,253 --> 00:12:19,181
I mean till your
pocket isn't empty.

133
00:12:21,818 --> 00:12:23,771
And what if your
pocket will be empty?

134
00:12:26,349 --> 00:12:29,634
Never mind,
I consider your pocket as mine.

135
00:12:29,714 --> 00:12:32,510
I think I must clear this
misunderstanding of yours.

136
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:36,424
- Oh!
- Waiter! One double scotch with soda.

137
00:12:36,504 --> 00:12:38,474
- And please send your manager.
- Ok, sir.

138
00:12:39,371 --> 00:12:45,230
Partners, what do you say?
A new game with new guest.

139
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,394
No limit. Touch for deal.

140
00:12:49,111 --> 00:12:53,514
No! New game new cards. Ok?

141
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:55,474
Ok.

142
00:12:56,017 --> 00:12:59,691
Jim, new set of cards. Ok?

143
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:11,035
- I'll break the seal.
- Ok, you please break the seal.

144
00:13:11,115 --> 00:13:12,618
- Best of luck!
- Thank you.

145
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:16,618
You're a real gambler it seems.
I like it.

146
00:13:19,701 --> 00:13:21,458
- Keep the change.
- Thank you, sir.

147
00:13:21,655 --> 00:13:23,658
Excuse me, sir. Did you call me?

148
00:13:23,738 --> 00:13:27,098
Manger, please send counters
worth 50000 for him.

149
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:29,538
You said there's
no limit on this table.

150
00:13:29,618 --> 00:13:33,138
I thought 50000 would be
enough to satisfy your hobby.

151
00:13:34,398 --> 00:13:36,198
It depends on one's own hobby.

152
00:13:36,758 --> 00:13:38,678
Manager, send all the counters..

153
00:13:38,758 --> 00:13:42,224
- Available in this casino. We'll share it.
- Yes, sir.

154
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,198
Get for deal, first to be.

155
00:13:50,373 --> 00:13:51,373
Yours.

156
00:13:55,675 --> 00:13:58,084
- Excuse me!
- Thank you.

157
00:13:59,478 --> 00:14:04,519
Oh, I'm sorry. My Mercedes
is parked outside. 8448.

158
00:14:04,599 --> 00:14:06,414
Please send somebody
to bring my black briefcase.

159
00:14:06,438 --> 00:14:08,529
- It contains all 1000 rupees' notes.
- What?

160
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:10,665
What happened? 1000 rupee's note
is not accepted in this casino?

161
00:14:10,689 --> 00:14:11,689
- Actually..
- Never mind.

162
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:14,169
There'll be a white briefcase.
It contains 100 rupees' notes.

163
00:14:14,205 --> 00:14:16,798
And please do it fast.
Because the game shouldn't stop.

164
00:14:16,878 --> 00:14:18,775
You please start with your game.
I'll arrange to bring it soon.

165
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:19,799
Thank you.

166
00:14:20,942 --> 00:14:23,476
Ok, gentleman! 1000..

167
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:26,932
Black and white. Both are there.

168
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:32,205
But where's the driver?
Driver! Driver!

169
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:37,251
Pack!

170
00:14:40,526 --> 00:14:45,250
- Blind!
- Pack! - Blind! - One more.

171
00:14:45,629 --> 00:14:46,930
Yes, again blind.

172
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,370
Blind!

173
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:02,130
Do you want to play, mister?

174
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:06,131
- This table is for no limit.
- No limit? - Yes.

175
00:15:12,026 --> 00:15:13,065
One more..

176
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:16,292
One more blind!

177
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:17,850
Double!

178
00:15:18,395 --> 00:15:20,330
Will you gamble in one game only?

179
00:15:21,035 --> 00:15:22,962
You won't have a chance
to play the second game.

180
00:15:23,042 --> 00:15:25,083
I play only one game in a day.

181
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,370
If you wish you can see your cards.

182
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,690
Ok, I'll see.

183
00:15:45,793 --> 00:15:47,724
Move! Gentleman, move!

184
00:15:50,729 --> 00:15:51,871
Cover!

185
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,631
Four!

186
00:15:54,711 --> 00:15:56,151
Where these people go?

187
00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:00,831
Three covers are done, mister.

188
00:16:02,183 --> 00:16:03,311
Ok.

189
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,823
Four more.

190
00:16:20,819 --> 00:16:21,911
One more?

191
00:16:23,098 --> 00:16:24,231
Four more!

192
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,700
Four.

193
00:16:28,765 --> 00:16:31,911
Yes, that's me. Excuse me!
I'll just receive a phone.

194
00:16:34,572 --> 00:16:35,671
My cards!

195
00:16:44,847 --> 00:16:45,999
Strange!

196
00:16:46,712 --> 00:16:48,831
Yes, hello!
King's prince Kalyawan speaking.

197
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:53,471
- Who's it?
- I'm your father. - Yes, papa.

198
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:57,671
- Your other partner has three cards of 9.
- Ok.

199
00:16:57,965 --> 00:17:00,991
- Take care.
- Ok, thank you!

200
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:16,485
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.
Papa is also very strange?

201
00:17:16,974 --> 00:17:19,002
He called me to inform
that dog is not eating anything.

202
00:17:19,026 --> 00:17:20,639
- What?
- Whose turn?

203
00:17:20,942 --> 00:17:22,239
- Yours.
- Ok.

204
00:17:24,998 --> 00:17:26,079
Strange!

205
00:17:26,731 --> 00:17:31,359
- Here..
- This is from me.

206
00:17:50,368 --> 00:17:51,599
10.

207
00:18:01,251 --> 00:18:03,159
- Thank you!
- You're welcome!

208
00:18:08,484 --> 00:18:09,540
Double!

209
00:18:13,903 --> 00:18:15,079
Double!

210
00:18:20,863 --> 00:18:23,159
Not here.. over there..

211
00:18:37,113 --> 00:18:38,340
Foolish!

212
00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:46,429
Hurry up!

213
00:18:47,674 --> 00:18:48,674
C'mon.

214
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:54,699
What a relief!

215
00:18:55,766 --> 00:18:58,034
- Has it ever happened with you?
- What?

216
00:19:00,084 --> 00:19:03,009
- Whose turn?
- Yours. - Oh, mine?

217
00:19:05,274 --> 00:19:08,322
- No limit!
- I know. I know.

218
00:19:16,132 --> 00:19:17,140
You..

219
00:19:23,419 --> 00:19:25,490
He has changed the cards.

220
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:29,802
Out of order?
Everything is useless here.

221
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,847
What will happen now?

222
00:19:35,584 --> 00:19:37,819
- Double!
- Double from me.

223
00:19:40,702 --> 00:19:41,702
One more!

224
00:19:43,221 --> 00:19:44,290
One more!

225
00:19:47,883 --> 00:19:48,889
Will you take with
Soda or with water?

226
00:19:48,913 --> 00:19:51,330
- Bring one glass of buttermilk.
- Ok, sir. Buttermilk?

227
00:19:52,871 --> 00:19:56,330
- One more!
- One more!

228
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,909
One more!

229
00:20:01,553 --> 00:20:02,785
One more from me.

230
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:09,690
One more.

231
00:20:10,157 --> 00:20:13,050
- Why don't you say show?
- Why?

232
00:20:13,262 --> 00:20:14,810
Are you gambling here or I?

233
00:20:15,857 --> 00:20:19,090
You please do the show. Please..

234
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:25,170
Now, this is the limit.
Mister, I said no limit.

235
00:20:26,089 --> 00:20:29,723
- Of course. No limit.
- Your turn.

236
00:20:29,803 --> 00:20:33,330
Sorry, Excuse me! Double!

237
00:20:37,746 --> 00:20:39,410
- Double!
- Double!

238
00:20:40,535 --> 00:20:42,830
Excuse me, your driver
is not present near the car.

239
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,540
Don't disturb me, please.
Just check.

240
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,570
He must be somewhere here.
Ok, who's turn?

241
00:20:47,107 --> 00:20:49,090
- You please wait there.
- Ok.

242
00:20:49,579 --> 00:20:50,730
Your turn.

243
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:53,009
One more!

244
00:20:56,009 --> 00:20:57,130
One more!

245
00:20:58,929 --> 00:21:01,330
Where this driver is?

246
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,983
One more!

247
00:21:07,164 --> 00:21:08,330
One more!

248
00:21:12,248 --> 00:21:13,434
Show!

249
00:21:29,911 --> 00:21:32,330
I asked to show.
I didn't throw my cards yet.

250
00:21:55,962 --> 00:21:58,650
Sir, your driver hasn't yet come.

251
00:21:58,867 --> 00:22:00,341
- He has still not returned?
- No.

252
00:22:00,421 --> 00:22:01,843
I think I must punish him.

253
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:04,426
Anyway, please take
care of him for now.

254
00:22:05,885 --> 00:22:06,885
He has fainted.

255
00:22:09,165 --> 00:22:10,248
Ajay!

256
00:22:14,164 --> 00:22:15,808
- Cash these counters.
- Of course.

257
00:22:16,784 --> 00:22:18,640
- No limit!
- You?

258
00:22:19,063 --> 00:22:19,994
Yes.

259
00:22:20,074 --> 00:22:22,011
When he'll be conscious
tell him that..

260
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,406
Tomorrow we'll come again.

261
00:22:28,172 --> 00:22:29,907
They said they would come tomorrow.

262
00:22:30,202 --> 00:22:32,222
- What?
- They will come again tomorrow.

263
00:22:35,851 --> 00:22:37,328
Never mind. I'll carry it.

264
00:22:41,775 --> 00:22:43,531
- Keep the change.
- Thank you, sir.

265
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:26,063
"Have you lost something, sir?"

266
00:23:31,797 --> 00:23:39,517
"Have you lost something, sir?"

267
00:23:39,777 --> 00:23:47,149
"What has happened
to you suddenly?"

268
00:23:47,229 --> 00:23:50,677
"Tell me something.
Don't keep quiet."

269
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:54,477
"Tell me something.
Don't keep quiet."

270
00:23:54,864 --> 00:23:58,931
"Why are you so upset?"

271
00:23:59,011 --> 00:24:06,785
"Have you lost something, sir?"

272
00:24:06,865 --> 00:24:12,985
"What has happened
to you suddenly?"

273
00:24:35,872 --> 00:24:39,345
"The past has gone.."

274
00:24:39,829 --> 00:24:43,505
"Now forget it."

275
00:24:43,923 --> 00:24:47,065
"Now forget it."

276
00:24:47,894 --> 00:24:55,242
"Enjoy life.. come in my hug."

277
00:24:55,714 --> 00:24:59,250
"Come in my hug."

278
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:03,071
"Come and reside in my
eyes that nobody will see you."

279
00:25:03,151 --> 00:25:07,396
"Reside in my heart without
anybody's knowledge."

280
00:25:07,476 --> 00:25:15,033
"Have you lost something, sir?"

281
00:25:15,511 --> 00:25:21,465
"What has happened
to you suddenly?"

282
00:25:51,969 --> 00:25:59,265
"I've gone crazy with
the first sight of yours."

283
00:25:59,974 --> 00:26:03,488
"I've gone crazy."

284
00:26:03,821 --> 00:26:11,105
"It's not good
to avoid me so much."

285
00:26:11,676 --> 00:26:14,883
"It's not good to avoid."

286
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:17,157
"Why do you ignore me so much,
my dear?"

287
00:26:17,237 --> 00:26:19,021
"Please let go off it now."

288
00:26:19,101 --> 00:26:23,286
"You won't find such love again.
Don't dishearten me."

289
00:26:23,366 --> 00:26:30,919
"Have you lost something, sir?"

290
00:26:31,438 --> 00:26:38,205
"What has happened
to you suddenly?"

291
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:42,588
"Tell me something.
Don't keep quiet."

292
00:26:42,819 --> 00:26:46,275
"Tell me something.
Don't keep quiet."

293
00:26:46,485 --> 00:26:50,851
"Why are you so upset?"

294
00:26:50,931 --> 00:26:58,655
"Have you lost something, sir?"

295
00:26:58,964 --> 00:27:05,185
"What has happened
to you suddenly?"

296
00:27:08,217 --> 00:27:09,217
Uncle!

297
00:27:10,064 --> 00:27:11,064
Uncle!

298
00:27:12,802 --> 00:27:16,173
- Ajay! You?
- Uncle, please sit. How are you?

299
00:27:16,441 --> 00:27:20,530
I'm fine, my child. But
where were you from so many days?

300
00:27:21,371 --> 00:27:24,052
- Where had you gone?
- It's a long story, uncle.

301
00:27:24,821 --> 00:27:26,581
You can say that
I've taken a rebirth.

302
00:27:27,264 --> 00:27:30,072
- Rebirth?
- Yes, uncle. I've got a friend.

303
00:27:30,221 --> 00:27:32,021
You can say he's an angle.

304
00:27:32,101 --> 00:27:34,341
Where's he? Why didn't
you bring him along with?

305
00:27:34,421 --> 00:27:35,861
I'll bring him one day, uncle.

306
00:27:35,941 --> 00:27:39,861
But for now, he has sent
a small gift for our area.

307
00:27:42,701 --> 00:27:45,381
- So many rupees?
- This is just a beginning, uncle.

308
00:27:45,461 --> 00:27:48,300
We'll change the entire
area by the grace of god.

309
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,676
You just pray for our
friendship to last long.

310
00:27:53,781 --> 00:27:59,096
Sherry, are you sure he was Vijay?

311
00:27:59,546 --> 00:28:02,995
Not just I,
but he also recognised me, PK.

312
00:28:03,812 --> 00:28:07,021
That means he has found us.

313
00:28:07,781 --> 00:28:09,701
Possible, that his entry
in the casino was just..

314
00:28:09,781 --> 00:28:10,941
A coincidence?

315
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:15,461
No, Sherry, do you remember
that night of Lucknow?

316
00:28:20,841 --> 00:28:22,841
I'm sure he has reached
till here on the basis of..

317
00:28:22,893 --> 00:28:24,228
That photograph.

318
00:28:24,887 --> 00:28:28,660
Never mind, PK. We'll kill him too.

319
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,861
No, Sherry!

320
00:28:30,921 --> 00:28:33,444
We must reach to his mother..

321
00:28:34,009 --> 00:28:36,404
To whom, Dinanath had
said everything about me.

322
00:28:36,878 --> 00:28:38,981
And god knows where
Vijay has hidden her.

323
00:30:42,687 --> 00:30:44,412
She's unconscious from the morning.

324
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:49,152
- Did you give her the new medicine?
- Yes.

325
00:30:49,928 --> 00:30:53,784
But it's useless.
She become conscious for a moment..

326
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,429
And starts with
the same old days.

327
00:30:57,048 --> 00:30:58,974
She asks, where's sir?

328
00:30:59,903 --> 00:31:01,592
Did you return from
the college or not?

329
00:31:01,672 --> 00:31:02,751
And where am I?

330
00:31:15,574 --> 00:31:17,431
A year has passed, Shanti.

331
00:31:18,213 --> 00:31:20,183
We left Lucknow and came to Mumbai.

332
00:31:21,106 --> 00:31:23,926
But, mummy didn't
come out of her shock.

333
00:31:25,772 --> 00:31:27,835
Even the medicines
are not reacting.

334
00:31:28,348 --> 00:31:30,231
Medicine will react
when she'll be sick.

335
00:31:31,465 --> 00:31:34,631
This is a terror that
has stuck in her mind.

336
00:31:35,928 --> 00:31:39,071
Sir, can't you bring
an expert doctor here?

337
00:31:40,952 --> 00:31:43,738
You very well know that
I can't bring anybody here.

338
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:47,991
But..There's no treatment
of her sickness?

339
00:31:51,016 --> 00:31:53,726
There's one, Shanti.

340
00:31:55,886 --> 00:31:57,351
But I can't find him.

341
00:32:00,103 --> 00:32:04,006
And if I'll find
him someday.. I'll.

342
00:32:12,829 --> 00:32:14,951
"God, I'm sailing
with the faith in you."

343
00:32:15,031 --> 00:32:17,391
"Kindly grace me and take
me to the other end successfully."

344
00:32:22,242 --> 00:32:24,002
"God, I'm sailing
with the faith in you."

345
00:32:24,082 --> 00:32:25,738
"Kindly grace me and take
me to the other end successfully."

346
00:32:25,762 --> 00:32:27,602
Have you started with your prayer?

347
00:32:29,325 --> 00:32:31,122
Before, it was your
routine in the morning..

348
00:32:31,202 --> 00:32:33,642
But now you've also
started praying in the evening?

349
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,802
Carry on! Carry on!

350
00:32:38,205 --> 00:32:40,484
I'll see how long you'd pray him.

351
00:32:41,272 --> 00:32:43,064
"God, I'm sailing
with the faith in you."

352
00:32:43,144 --> 00:32:44,380
"Kindly grace me and take
me to the other end successfully."

353
00:32:44,404 --> 00:32:49,002
He won't just help you..
He'll kick you..

354
00:32:49,525 --> 00:32:52,215
Kick you in such a way that..

355
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,442
You'd remember
it in your entire life.

356
00:32:56,813 --> 00:32:58,619
Hanuman's devotee!

357
00:32:59,097 --> 00:33:01,322
Disbeliever of god.
Go to sleep now.

358
00:33:02,421 --> 00:33:06,337
Why are you folding
your hands and praying?

359
00:33:17,002 --> 00:33:20,434
Get up! Vijay, Get up!

360
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:26,144
- Get up!
- O god!

361
00:33:26,562 --> 00:33:30,464
- Your tea is getting cold.
- Thank you.

362
00:33:33,521 --> 00:33:34,784
What are you drinking?

363
00:33:35,234 --> 00:33:38,704
The same that you drink at night.

364
00:33:38,784 --> 00:33:41,744
- I'm drinking it in the morning.
- Give! Give it here. Give it..

365
00:33:42,344 --> 00:33:43,872
Leave! Leave it!

366
00:33:45,097 --> 00:33:47,704
Are you acting with me?
This is cold drink.

367
00:33:48,362 --> 00:33:51,520
Idiot! Do you know about
your situation at night?

368
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,106
I'm sorry.
I hope I didn't misbehave.

369
00:33:54,186 --> 00:33:57,544
No, not much. Instead
you came in like a good boy.

370
00:33:57,624 --> 00:33:59,704
Touched my feet.
Took my blessings and promised me..

371
00:33:59,784 --> 00:34:01,984
That you'd never drink liquor.
That's it.

372
00:34:02,288 --> 00:34:05,864
No! I never did all this.
But I can remember that I was..

373
00:34:05,944 --> 00:34:07,544
Talking about sailing.

374
00:34:07,624 --> 00:34:10,264
Yes, one bottle was
stuck up in your mouth.

375
00:34:10,344 --> 00:34:11,550
I've kept it safely.

376
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:14,005
Oh, c'mon, I said sorry.
Now will you kill me?

377
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:17,184
Your life is showered for girls.
How will I take it?

378
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:20,515
Ok, stop joking. Have you prepared
the list of those great men?

379
00:34:20,594 --> 00:34:22,383
- Shall we start with our work?
- Yes.

380
00:34:23,647 --> 00:34:25,099
- Shall I read the names?
- Yes.

381
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:27,864
- First number is sage Ramdin.
- Occupation?

382
00:34:28,029 --> 00:34:30,282
He's the trustee of five
temples and seven mosques.?

383
00:34:30,362 --> 00:34:32,833
- That means he owns the paradise.
- Yes.

384
00:34:32,913 --> 00:34:35,393
If not from temple
he can enter from mosque.

385
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:38,858
He smuggles and hides
it in the temples.

386
00:34:38,938 --> 00:34:41,144
- After all he's a great soul.
- Yes.

387
00:34:41,648 --> 00:34:42,692
Second number is..

388
00:34:42,772 --> 00:34:46,337
- Hello, I'm Khatlewala!
- Khatlewala.

389
00:34:46,553 --> 00:34:49,883
- Hello!
- How's your salt business going?

390
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:53,123
Salt business? I never sell salt.

391
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:58,723
- But you do sell girls.
- You bloody fool, idiot!

392
00:34:58,803 --> 00:35:01,443
We've come from Delhi's
special crime branch.

393
00:35:02,126 --> 00:35:04,642
And we've the list
of all your secret places.

394
00:35:04,722 --> 00:35:07,483
And we're given orders
that you must be made bald..

395
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:10,457
And take out your
procession on donkey.

396
00:35:10,844 --> 00:35:13,322
And all the girls whose
life you've spoiled..

397
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:17,201
Will hit your bald
with her footwear. And..

398
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:21,842
- This much is enough for him. Now number 2.
- Ok.

399
00:35:27,995 --> 00:35:29,115
Hello!

400
00:35:30,075 --> 00:35:33,395
- Is it Dhaniram?
- I'm just Dhani (rich) by name.

401
00:35:33,475 --> 00:35:37,195
- Otherwise I'm poor.
- Yes, it seems you've a black tongue.

402
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:39,035
That speaks everything true.

403
00:35:39,115 --> 00:35:43,475
- What rubbish!
- Yes, we're calling from CBI, Delhi.

404
00:35:45,304 --> 00:35:50,987
What are you saying? Hello! Hello!

405
00:36:08,944 --> 00:36:10,915
You just see what I
do tonight at the casino.

406
00:36:10,995 --> 00:36:13,043
All of them are connected
with that casino.

407
00:36:13,325 --> 00:36:15,915
- Shall we go!
- Ok.

408
00:36:24,374 --> 00:36:27,355
Whatever you say, but if
they were from police department..

409
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:30,755
Or CBI they wouldn't
have informed us before coming.

410
00:36:30,835 --> 00:36:33,155
Why they would have called
us before? Think over it.

411
00:36:33,235 --> 00:36:37,395
He's right. Possible that
somebody made fun with us.

412
00:36:37,835 --> 00:36:40,915
Or our enemy tried to threat us.

413
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:43,395
Friends,
whether it's a fun or enmity.

414
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:45,595
We must be careful in any ways.

415
00:36:46,035 --> 00:36:47,755
It was ok,
if PK, would be in the city.

416
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:50,595
But if anything will
happen in his absence..

417
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:52,195
Then who will dare to face him?

418
00:36:52,275 --> 00:36:54,515
If police has really come
to know about our business..

419
00:36:54,841 --> 00:36:57,195
Then they must have
kept watch on every step of us.

420
00:36:57,604 --> 00:37:01,035
- Friends, I've an idea.
- What's that?

421
00:37:01,237 --> 00:37:03,155
Master Brahmanand
has come to our city..

422
00:37:03,235 --> 00:37:04,158
- Brahmanand?
- Yes..

423
00:37:04,238 --> 00:37:08,235
His two disciples have come
to our city. Let's invite them.

424
00:37:08,486 --> 00:37:10,359
Let's have a program
of devotional hymns.

425
00:37:10,439 --> 00:37:12,119
And invite great
personalities of the city.

426
00:37:12,393 --> 00:37:14,712
This way police will
be diverted to us..

427
00:37:14,792 --> 00:37:16,875
And our men will
arrange to send the goods..

428
00:37:16,955 --> 00:37:19,163
To the basement from temple.

429
00:37:19,458 --> 00:37:21,075
Wow! Excellent idea!

430
00:37:21,253 --> 00:37:22,749
Then why to wait
for the good thing?

431
00:37:22,829 --> 00:37:24,491
- Invite them tomorrow.
- Ok.

432
00:37:24,571 --> 00:37:25,582
- Goga sir!
- Yes.

433
00:37:25,662 --> 00:37:28,304
You please send the
invitation to everybody.

434
00:37:28,384 --> 00:37:29,384
Ok.

435
00:37:29,464 --> 00:37:30,474
Not a bad idea.

436
00:37:32,638 --> 00:37:33,751
Who are they?

437
00:37:36,386 --> 00:37:38,074
Who are you?

438
00:37:40,036 --> 00:37:43,450
We both are black thieves.

439
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:44,755
- Black thieves?
- Yes.

440
00:37:44,945 --> 00:37:47,732
- Yes, sir!
- Catch them. Don't let them go.

441
00:37:53,628 --> 00:37:55,097
Catch them! Don't miss them.

442
00:37:55,177 --> 00:37:56,568
Don't let them escape.

443
00:38:41,548 --> 00:38:43,368
There! C'mon!

444
00:38:59,663 --> 00:39:04,928
Beat them! Beat! Catch them!

445
00:39:09,903 --> 00:39:15,248
Beat them! Beat! Catch them!

446
00:40:09,209 --> 00:40:10,768
There!

447
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:37,170
Our luck really favours sometime.

448
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:40,570
You always get carried away.

449
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:43,210
She's not yours. She's my luck.

450
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:46,130
Look, I'm elder to you.
Listen to me.

451
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:48,050
Pray your Hanuman
for few more years.

452
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:51,425
- She's your to be sister in law.
- Sister in law? - Yes.

453
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:00,724
You? How come you're here?

454
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:05,145
- You? You..
- Don't say anything.

455
00:41:05,225 --> 00:41:08,334
- I thought you're joking. But you're congratulation!
- Thank you.

456
00:41:09,347 --> 00:41:11,364
Is it good to enter in
somebody's house at this night?

457
00:41:11,388 --> 00:41:14,023
Please don't misunderstand.

458
00:41:14,103 --> 00:41:15,743
Actually,
those goons were standing down..

459
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:16,753
Who were forcing you that day.

460
00:41:16,833 --> 00:41:18,521
I thought something is fishy.
So I came up.

461
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:19,677
I hope you're alright.

462
00:41:19,757 --> 00:41:21,432
But how did you get my address?

463
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:23,534
It's very simple.
When they stopped down..

464
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:25,823
At this bungalow
we immediately came up.

465
00:41:26,131 --> 00:41:29,144
- Who are you?
- I'm the one who does everything for him.

466
00:41:29,224 --> 00:41:30,586
- What?
- Yes.

467
00:41:30,666 --> 00:41:32,594
Ok, I'll call up the police now.

468
00:41:32,674 --> 00:41:34,281
Why do you drag the
police in this matter?

469
00:41:34,305 --> 00:41:36,148
- They have left by now.
- And we're also going. -Yes.

470
00:41:36,172 --> 00:41:37,875
But tell me your name please..

471
00:41:38,061 --> 00:41:40,255
- He's Ajay and I'm Vijay. Yours?
- Asha!

472
00:41:41,553 --> 00:41:43,292
But I hope you'd
remember the address now.

473
00:41:43,372 --> 00:41:46,252
Yes! Address!
Two disciple of Brahmanand. Oh!

474
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,468
Disciple of Brahmanand?

475
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:54,412
They are two disciples
of master Brahmanand.

476
00:41:54,863 --> 00:41:57,732
The entire country
is aware of their power.

477
00:41:57,969 --> 00:42:03,292
They reside in Himalayas
cave and eat only roots.

478
00:42:03,467 --> 00:42:06,852
Meditation is their life.

479
00:42:07,285 --> 00:42:09,772
I've requested them
for your betterment..

480
00:42:09,977 --> 00:42:14,532
And made them come
here from Himalayas.

481
00:42:14,612 --> 00:42:18,061
He's lying so much.
Did you recognise him?

482
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,581
- He's that same waiter of the hotel.
- Yes.

483
00:42:20,858 --> 00:42:24,901
When star favours,
any difficult work becomes easier.

484
00:42:24,981 --> 00:42:30,181
What can be done,
so that we are out of trouble.

485
00:42:30,605 --> 00:42:31,981
So, ladies and gentlemen.

486
00:42:38,171 --> 00:42:39,381
- Priest!
- Yes.

487
00:42:39,649 --> 00:42:41,701
I beg your pardon
for disturbing you.

488
00:42:42,455 --> 00:42:44,703
I hope you've recognised us.

489
00:42:46,617 --> 00:42:49,312
Of course.
Why did you take pain to come here?

490
00:42:49,392 --> 00:42:51,296
You should have called me.
I'd have come.

491
00:42:51,376 --> 00:42:53,945
Your grandfather has sent us here.

492
00:42:54,025 --> 00:42:56,848
- Grandfather?
- Yes. Your grandmother expired.

493
00:42:57,050 --> 00:43:01,021
What? So, friends,
my grandmother died.

494
00:43:01,466 --> 00:43:03,901
Master, I'm sorry. But I'm going.

495
00:43:05,645 --> 00:43:07,781
Do something that
these two won't go to..

496
00:43:07,861 --> 00:43:10,081
- Dhaniram's place tonight.
- No?

497
00:43:11,003 --> 00:43:13,135
Yes, ok.
They won't go. How can they go?

498
00:43:13,309 --> 00:43:14,439
They won't go.

499
00:43:15,517 --> 00:43:18,543
Thank you, my lord!
You're another form of a god.

500
00:43:18,623 --> 00:43:21,621
Till today, I had seen only one.
I am seeing them together today.

501
00:43:29,224 --> 00:43:30,941
Cigarette from my cap?

502
00:43:31,212 --> 00:43:33,219
- Miracle!
- God!

503
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:43,708
Miracle! Miracle!

504
00:43:45,666 --> 00:43:49,308
- Cigarette?
- Silly, do you call our offering, a cigarette?

505
00:43:49,616 --> 00:43:55,348
- Smoke!
- Smoke, sir. Fast! Yes.

506
00:43:59,981 --> 00:44:02,788
Miracle!
God! You're the heart reader.

507
00:44:02,868 --> 00:44:04,792
You must have understood my wish.

508
00:44:04,872 --> 00:44:08,215
Yes, my child.
You're not the one that you appear.

509
00:44:08,295 --> 00:44:12,922
And only our intelligent
eyes can see your real form.

510
00:44:13,002 --> 00:44:16,766
I'm your slave.
You've proved your greatness.

511
00:44:16,846 --> 00:44:19,735
But, my child. We're also
not the same that you think us.

512
00:44:19,815 --> 00:44:22,047
I'm an ordinary human.
How can I understand?

513
00:44:22,127 --> 00:44:24,727
But, we promise you that
before going from here..

514
00:44:24,807 --> 00:44:28,447
We'll give you an eyesight
to view everything clear.

515
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,600
What?

516
00:44:31,731 --> 00:44:36,127
- Eyesight.
- Oh! Come! Please come.

517
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:40,763
Devotees, master have come!
Salute them.

518
00:44:41,042 --> 00:44:42,767
- Salutation, master!
- Greeting, master!

519
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:45,326
- Salutation, master!
- Greeting, master!

520
00:44:45,406 --> 00:44:47,452
- Salutation, master!
- Greeting, master!

521
00:44:47,532 --> 00:44:50,160
- Salutation, master!
- Greeting, master!

522
00:44:50,687 --> 00:44:53,807
Salutation, master!

523
00:45:15,026 --> 00:45:20,257
- "Till now you had forgotten god."
- Yes.

524
00:45:20,976 --> 00:45:24,066
"Till now you had forgotten god."

525
00:45:24,519 --> 00:45:28,303
"Now you've started praying him.."

526
00:45:29,397 --> 00:45:32,458
"When you realised
your wealth is decreasing."

527
00:45:33,183 --> 00:45:35,706
"And that made you restless."

528
00:45:36,399 --> 00:45:41,002
"So you started with
donations and charities."

529
00:45:42,935 --> 00:45:48,146
- "But no need to worry at all."
- No.

530
00:45:48,303 --> 00:45:52,257
- "We're with you."
- Of course!

531
00:45:52,337 --> 00:45:57,287
"We'll send.."

532
00:45:57,725 --> 00:46:02,266
"Your message to Him."

533
00:46:02,563 --> 00:46:03,629
Because..

534
00:46:05,193 --> 00:46:09,466
"At God.."

535
00:46:09,743 --> 00:46:14,212
"At God.."

536
00:46:14,292 --> 00:46:18,488
"There's delay but not denial."

537
00:46:18,568 --> 00:46:23,106
"There's delay but not denial."

538
00:46:23,186 --> 00:46:27,719
"At God,
there's delay but not denial."

539
00:46:27,799 --> 00:46:32,103
"At God,
there's delay but not denial."

540
00:46:32,183 --> 00:46:36,249
"This is the game
of one's own destiny."

541
00:46:36,329 --> 00:46:40,518
"This is the game
of one's own destiny."

542
00:46:40,598 --> 00:46:44,728
"And time swaps accordingly."

543
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:49,349
"And time swaps accordingly."

544
00:46:49,429 --> 00:46:54,066
"And time swaps accordingly."

545
00:47:11,379 --> 00:47:15,762
"As much you love your wealth.."

546
00:47:15,842 --> 00:47:17,965
Yes, wealth..

547
00:47:18,045 --> 00:47:22,621
"So much if you love the god."

548
00:47:22,701 --> 00:47:26,748
"So much if you love the god."

549
00:47:26,828 --> 00:47:31,315
"Then all your
problems and sorrows.."

550
00:47:31,395 --> 00:47:35,637
"Will keep away from you."

551
00:47:35,717 --> 00:47:40,059
"Will keep away from you."

552
00:47:40,139 --> 00:47:44,293
"Stop running after the money.."

553
00:47:44,373 --> 00:47:48,619
"Stop running after the money.."

554
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:52,979
"It's neither yours nor mine."

555
00:47:53,059 --> 00:47:57,579
"It's neither yours nor mine."

556
00:47:57,899 --> 00:47:58,939
"It's mine, not yours.."

557
00:47:59,019 --> 00:48:00,118
"It's mine, mine only."

558
00:48:00,198 --> 00:48:02,139
"It's mine, mine only."

559
00:48:04,166 --> 00:48:08,257
"It's mine.
Mine! It's mine! It's mine.."

560
00:48:08,873 --> 00:48:12,299
"It's neither yours nor mine."

561
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:16,579
"It's the time that swaps."

562
00:48:16,659 --> 00:48:21,419
"It's the time that swaps."

563
00:48:40,659 --> 00:48:44,979
"Gold, silver,
diamonds and pearls."

564
00:48:45,059 --> 00:48:47,130
"Diamonds and pearls."

565
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:51,645
"It'll remain as
it is in your locker."

566
00:48:51,725 --> 00:48:55,967
"It'll remain as
it is in your locker."

567
00:48:56,047 --> 00:49:00,601
"He knows everything
about what you've kept.."

568
00:49:00,681 --> 00:49:04,653
"In each and every
sack of your basement."

569
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:08,911
"In each and every
sack of your basement."

570
00:49:08,991 --> 00:49:13,111
"This prosperity won't
accompany you forever."

571
00:49:13,191 --> 00:49:17,431
"This prosperity won't
accompany you forever."

572
00:49:17,511 --> 00:49:21,815
"It's a heap of sins."

573
00:49:21,895 --> 00:49:26,186
"It's a heap of sins."

574
00:49:26,266 --> 00:49:30,479
"This is the game
of one's own destiny."

575
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:34,800
"And time swaps accordingly."

576
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:39,023
"And time swaps accordingly."

577
00:49:39,103 --> 00:49:43,711
"And time swaps accordingly."

578
00:50:00,489 --> 00:50:04,757
"You please don't
be greedy for more."

579
00:50:04,837 --> 00:50:06,889
Yes, don't be greedy.

580
00:50:06,969 --> 00:50:11,219
"You eat and let others eat, too."

581
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:15,622
"You eat and let others eat, too."

582
00:50:15,702 --> 00:50:20,386
- "Welcome, everything that comes to you."
- Welcome!

583
00:50:20,466 --> 00:50:24,106
"And don't cry for
things that goes."

584
00:50:24,186 --> 00:50:28,668
"And don't cry for
things that goes."

585
00:50:28,748 --> 00:50:30,946
"Let it go. And welcome rest."

586
00:50:31,026 --> 00:50:33,146
"Welcome! Welcome rest."

587
00:50:35,003 --> 00:50:37,228
"Let it come! Welcome it!"

588
00:50:38,495 --> 00:50:42,835
"Keep in mind what sages say."

589
00:50:42,915 --> 00:50:47,028
"Keep in mind what sages say."

590
00:50:47,108 --> 00:50:51,226
"It's better for you."

591
00:50:51,306 --> 00:50:55,426
"It's better for you."

592
00:50:55,506 --> 00:50:59,827
"It's the time that swaps."

593
00:50:59,907 --> 00:51:04,426
"It's the time that swaps."

594
00:51:19,518 --> 00:51:21,426
"He knows everything
about his children.."

595
00:51:21,506 --> 00:51:23,547
"About all your
illegal businesses."

596
00:51:23,627 --> 00:51:26,826
"About all your
illegal businesses."

597
00:51:29,706 --> 00:51:31,773
"You've only two,
but he has millions of hands."

598
00:51:31,853 --> 00:51:33,666
"You're nothing at his power."

599
00:51:33,746 --> 00:51:37,066
"You're nothing at his power."

600
00:51:39,833 --> 00:51:42,866
"If he wish he can convert.."

601
00:51:44,003 --> 00:51:45,995
"If he wish he can convert.."

602
00:51:46,075 --> 00:51:49,026
"Your days into night
and night into days."

603
00:51:52,193 --> 00:51:54,666
"You're a branch
and he's the leaves."

604
00:51:56,213 --> 00:51:58,250
"You're a branch
and he's the leaves."

605
00:51:58,330 --> 00:52:00,866
"You seem to be at distance
but both are together."

606
00:52:04,112 --> 00:52:08,221
"You think yourself very smart."

607
00:52:08,301 --> 00:52:12,321
"You think yourself very smart."

608
00:52:12,401 --> 00:52:16,490
"But He's smarter than you."

609
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:20,266
"But He's smarter than you."

610
00:52:20,346 --> 00:52:24,426
"It's the time that swaps."

611
00:52:24,506 --> 00:52:28,131
"It's the time that swaps."

612
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:32,386
"It's the time that swaps."

613
00:52:37,536 --> 00:52:40,256
Your game is over, Smugglers.

614
00:52:40,336 --> 00:52:42,696
What appearance is this, master?

615
00:52:42,933 --> 00:52:45,016
We never understand your language.

616
00:52:45,096 --> 00:52:48,736
Play such game with
us that we can understand.

617
00:52:48,816 --> 00:52:51,769
This is our real appearance.

618
00:52:51,976 --> 00:52:52,856
What do you mean?

619
00:52:52,936 --> 00:52:54,416
Am I right, Inspector Hirachand?

620
00:52:54,816 --> 00:52:56,696
Yes, inspector Virachand.

621
00:52:57,736 --> 00:53:01,336
Inspector Hirachand?
Inspector Virachand.

622
00:53:01,773 --> 00:53:06,136
Yes, Inspector Hirachand
and Virachand..

623
00:53:06,376 --> 00:53:10,296
From CBI.
'Sabji Mandi.' New Delhi.

624
00:53:10,376 --> 00:53:13,833
And constable Pandu.
Police station, Nagpada. Mumbai.

625
00:53:13,913 --> 00:53:17,496
Don't you dare!
If you try to escape from here..

626
00:53:17,576 --> 00:53:19,216
I'll shot you dead.

627
00:53:19,525 --> 00:53:22,693
You're under arrest!
Take them away.

628
00:53:25,096 --> 00:53:27,094
But where shall
I drop them at last?

629
00:53:27,174 --> 00:53:30,961
Drop them anywhere near
the market or station..

630
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,623
Or at any other place.

631
00:53:32,703 --> 00:53:34,456
But far away from
the police station.

632
00:53:34,782 --> 00:53:37,736
- Understood?
- Yes. C'mon, let's go.

633
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:43,452
But where will take
away these goods?

634
00:53:43,532 --> 00:53:45,804
A customer is ready to pay 50000.

635
00:53:45,884 --> 00:53:47,660
But it's worth millions.

636
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:49,796
What's our loss in this?

637
00:53:49,876 --> 00:53:51,296
Welcome everything that comes..

638
00:53:51,376 --> 00:53:53,256
And don't cry on
things that goes off.

639
00:53:53,963 --> 00:54:00,576
4 and 4, 8. And 4, 12.
And 4 make 16. And 4 make 20..

640
00:54:00,822 --> 00:54:03,901
And 4 make 24. And this is 25th.

641
00:54:03,981 --> 00:54:05,225
And this is 25th.

642
00:54:05,305 --> 00:54:09,496
25 plus 25? 50. Cheers.

643
00:54:11,757 --> 00:54:14,708
I hope this big thievery
won't put us in trouble.

644
00:54:14,788 --> 00:54:16,183
Have you come to your level?

645
00:54:16,263 --> 00:54:18,540
We didn't come under doubt
after so many small thieveries.

646
00:54:18,564 --> 00:54:21,056
And today you're scared
after big thievery?

647
00:54:21,629 --> 00:54:24,274
Doing the thievery
at the thieves house..

648
00:54:24,354 --> 00:54:27,094
Isn't called a thievery.
It's called swapping.

649
00:54:29,252 --> 00:54:31,649
I tell you.
When they'll come to know that..

650
00:54:31,729 --> 00:54:33,851
They are being cheated.
They will literally cry.

651
00:54:33,931 --> 00:54:34,856
Again you're wrong.

652
00:54:34,936 --> 00:54:37,164
They'll neither cry
nor open their mouth.

653
00:54:37,244 --> 00:54:39,689
As if they'll keep quiet.
What if they will come here?

654
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:41,889
Who's it now?

655
00:54:44,497 --> 00:54:49,489
Oh God! A raid. Let's run. Come on.

656
00:54:49,686 --> 00:54:50,785
Hurry up!

657
00:55:04,898 --> 00:55:07,129
- Who's it?
- There's a girl.

658
00:55:07,502 --> 00:55:08,649
- Girl?
- Yes.

659
00:55:16,451 --> 00:55:21,254
I'm in trouble.
They are following me.

660
00:55:21,589 --> 00:55:23,427
They want to play with my chastity.

661
00:55:25,742 --> 00:55:27,644
They want to play with my chastity.

662
00:55:27,724 --> 00:55:29,725
- What?
- Rape!

663
00:55:29,939 --> 00:55:33,409
- What does he think..
- No, sir. Please don't go there.

664
00:55:33,489 --> 00:55:36,935
- They are very dangerous.
- Ok, fine. We won't go.

665
00:55:37,015 --> 00:55:39,970
Otherwise..
We'd have taught them lesson.

666
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:44,605
- What?
- I mean we'd have beaten them very hard.

667
00:55:44,685 --> 00:55:47,006
He has a habit to talk
everything in puzzle.

668
00:55:47,086 --> 00:55:48,801
- You please don't worry. Come in!
- Come!

669
00:55:48,881 --> 00:55:50,095
Please come!

670
00:55:52,311 --> 00:55:56,369
Sit here. please..
Don't worry. Please have a seat.

671
00:55:56,587 --> 00:55:57,769
Please sit down.

672
00:56:02,719 --> 00:56:09,168
- I'll drop you home.
- O god!

673
00:56:09,529 --> 00:56:11,702
What will happen with me?

674
00:56:14,042 --> 00:56:15,854
Water!

675
00:56:15,934 --> 00:56:18,609
- Please give me a glass of water.
- Yes, I'll bring it. Hurry up!

676
00:56:19,822 --> 00:56:24,009
Hurry up! You please sit down.

677
00:56:24,793 --> 00:56:29,049
You please don't worry.
Actually, you're scared.

678
00:56:29,411 --> 00:56:32,049
No need to get scared.
Both of us are here.

679
00:56:34,127 --> 00:56:35,569
Please come soon.

680
00:56:37,101 --> 00:56:43,089
- Here is the water. Please have it.
- Thank you.

681
00:56:44,015 --> 00:56:45,521
Tell me something, madam.

682
00:56:46,021 --> 00:56:49,089
Where were you
going alone at night?

683
00:56:49,681 --> 00:56:52,548
You're too much.
Why did you ask her at this time?

684
00:56:52,628 --> 00:56:54,247
But what did I say?

685
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:56,147
You're scolding me
as if I've made her cry.

686
00:56:56,227 --> 00:56:58,682
You don't understand.
Any hurt heart..

687
00:56:58,762 --> 00:57:01,376
Can start crying
with a single bump.

688
00:57:02,682 --> 00:57:03,962
- What happened?
- Nothing.

689
00:57:05,009 --> 00:57:07,922
Nothing. Actually,
he can't see anybody in pain.

690
00:57:09,402 --> 00:57:13,082
You're so kind.

691
00:57:14,473 --> 00:57:17,842
I wish I should
have a friend like you.

692
00:57:17,922 --> 00:57:19,162
I'm there. I'm there.

693
00:57:20,122 --> 00:57:21,642
Again you made her cry?

694
00:57:21,722 --> 00:57:23,050
- What are you doing?
- C'mon, get up!

695
00:57:23,074 --> 00:57:26,584
- What are you doing?
- Go and bring something to eat.

696
00:57:26,664 --> 00:57:29,082
- Why are you sending me?
- I'm there. You go.

697
00:57:34,543 --> 00:57:36,802
Look! You please don't cry.

698
00:57:37,714 --> 00:57:39,642
We'll drop you at your
home after some time.

699
00:57:41,185 --> 00:57:42,218
Home?

700
00:57:45,312 --> 00:57:47,562
You mean you're restricted
to enter in your house?

701
00:57:48,411 --> 00:57:53,442
Yes. But nobody can restrict me..

702
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:56,975
To go to ocean or railway track.

703
00:57:57,055 --> 00:57:59,478
- What are you saying?
- Listen to me.

704
00:57:59,558 --> 00:58:01,650
You can stay here
as long as you wish.

705
00:58:01,981 --> 00:58:06,722
- As long as you wish.
- Really? - Yes.

706
00:58:06,802 --> 00:58:09,722
You can consider it your own house.
Now go and get fresh.

707
00:58:09,802 --> 00:58:11,562
Vijay will be back
with some food now.

708
00:58:11,959 --> 00:58:14,122
There he comes. He has come.

709
00:58:18,497 --> 00:58:19,497
A hen.

710
00:58:23,682 --> 00:58:27,402
My god! What happened?

711
00:58:40,438 --> 00:58:43,522
"In love the lover was bashed up."

712
00:58:44,345 --> 00:58:48,202
"The lover was bashed up."

713
00:58:49,242 --> 00:58:52,242
"The lover was bashed up."

714
00:58:57,903 --> 00:59:01,002
- What happened?
- They killed Gulfam.

715
00:59:01,082 --> 00:59:03,402
- Who?
- Those goon!

716
00:59:04,272 --> 00:59:07,522
- Goon?
- Yes, those who were following you.

717
00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:09,962
I was alone and they were four.

718
00:59:10,722 --> 00:59:13,968
Four? But they were eight?

719
00:59:14,048 --> 00:59:17,020
I could see only four with one eye.

720
00:59:17,575 --> 00:59:20,113
They didn't let
me open my other eye.

721
00:59:20,193 --> 00:59:22,282
But I've beaten them so hard that..

722
00:59:22,362 --> 00:59:26,602
They will never misbehave
with any girl in life.

723
00:59:27,501 --> 00:59:33,610
- But you're also injured.
- What are you looking at?

724
00:59:33,690 --> 00:59:35,360
Please bring some hot water. Fast.

725
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:38,102
Water? Yes, ok. Water.

726
00:59:41,976 --> 00:59:44,096
The moment he sees any girl,
he starts with his drama,

727
00:59:44,141 --> 00:59:47,742
Add some salt in the water.

728
00:59:49,112 --> 00:59:50,552
Want some salt?

729
00:59:50,632 --> 00:59:52,262
I'll add it now.

730
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:55,534
Tell him to bring a
glass of warm milk please.

731
00:59:55,614 --> 00:59:58,822
Ok, and a glass full of warm milk.

732
00:59:59,142 --> 01:00:03,262
- With some butter.
- Butter? With butter in it.

733
01:00:03,342 --> 01:00:08,262
With butter? Ok, with butter.
Let me add butter like this.

734
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:15,542
- I'm very hungry.
- Here's your milk with butter.

735
01:00:15,928 --> 01:00:19,022
And this is your water.

736
01:00:20,257 --> 01:00:25,877
Ah! Ah!

737
01:00:25,957 --> 01:00:29,248
Sir, here's the
water and milk both.

738
01:00:29,521 --> 01:00:32,846
- What would you like to drink?
- Milk. - Milk!

739
01:00:33,048 --> 01:00:36,162
Please lie down. I'll help you.

740
01:00:36,242 --> 01:00:38,222
Idiot! Had they broke your hands..

741
01:00:38,302 --> 01:00:40,825
That you're drinking
from her hand?

742
01:00:40,905 --> 01:00:44,845
- What are you saying?
- You don't know him.

743
01:00:44,925 --> 01:00:46,790
He's smart in doing
drama with girl.

744
01:00:46,870 --> 01:00:48,822
Sometime he says my
grandmother died and..

745
01:00:48,902 --> 01:00:50,145
Sometime he says
grandfather has died.

746
01:00:50,169 --> 01:00:51,919
No, I never lie like him.
It's true..

747
01:00:51,999 --> 01:00:54,140
That my grandparents have died.

748
01:00:54,220 --> 01:00:57,642
- You please give me milk.
- Yes, ok. - Please..

749
01:00:59,045 --> 01:01:00,640
Was it milk or something else?

750
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:05,073
- It's milk with some salt.
- Please, drink it.

751
01:01:05,153 --> 01:01:06,848
- What are you doing?
- It's good for your health.

752
01:01:06,872 --> 01:01:10,765
Yes, it's good for your health.
C'mon, drink it. Good boy!

753
01:01:10,845 --> 01:01:15,619
- You!
- Madam, it's too late now.

754
01:01:15,699 --> 01:01:16,887
You please go and
sleep in the other room.

755
01:01:16,911 --> 01:01:18,573
- We'll sleep here.
- But, he..

756
01:01:18,653 --> 01:01:20,413
You just don't worry about him.

757
01:01:20,493 --> 01:01:21,653
He'll be fine by the morning.

758
01:01:22,813 --> 01:01:27,133
- Yes, everything will be fine by morning.
- Yes.

759
01:01:27,213 --> 01:01:29,773
- Ok, then. I'll go to sleep.
- Yes, let's go.

760
01:01:30,053 --> 01:01:33,453
- Let's go and sleep. Let me go.
- No. - What are you doing?

761
01:01:33,533 --> 01:01:36,813
- No!
- Let me go! Shut up!

762
01:02:14,099 --> 01:02:17,213
- You're still awakening?
- Yes, my child.

763
01:02:17,830 --> 01:02:21,773
When a fire is at home
and a child is innocent..

764
01:02:22,455 --> 01:02:26,533
Then one must remain alert.
C'mon, go to sleep.

765
01:02:27,564 --> 01:02:30,253
Neither you enjoy life
nor do you let me enjoy.

766
01:02:45,956 --> 01:02:49,805
Vijay! Vijay! Get up, now!

767
01:02:50,706 --> 01:02:52,739
It's 9 AM. Now go and wake her up.

768
01:02:52,819 --> 01:02:55,339
Neither you slept nor did you
let me sleep for the entire night.

769
01:02:56,470 --> 01:02:58,499
- I want to change dress.
- Just a moment.

770
01:03:13,103 --> 01:03:15,109
Are you taking bath, madam?

771
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:17,939
It seems he stuck up there.

772
01:03:22,391 --> 01:03:24,284
We're robbed. We're finished.

773
01:03:24,364 --> 01:03:25,407
Neither a girl nor
the money is in the room.

774
01:03:25,431 --> 01:03:26,705
She has left a note.

775
01:03:27,629 --> 01:03:29,711
Friends, this prosperity
was neither yours nor mine..

776
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:31,703
It was just a swapping of time.

777
01:03:32,111 --> 01:03:35,231
Money came with you at
night and now it's going with me.

778
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:37,288
Thank you very much
for the trouble at night.

779
01:03:37,368 --> 01:03:39,671
I'll be happy if you take
the diner with me tonight..

780
01:03:39,751 --> 01:03:42,268
And give me a chance
to clear your balance.

781
01:03:42,551 --> 01:03:44,711
My address is 47 park avenue, Khar.

782
01:03:44,791 --> 01:03:46,138
Bombay 52. Kiran.

783
01:03:46,911 --> 01:03:48,271
- Now what will happen?
- What?

784
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:50,631
- We'll back answer her.
- Of course.

785
01:03:51,751 --> 01:03:53,071
I hope she's not back again.

786
01:03:56,053 --> 01:03:58,951
- Police! - Police?
- Welcome, inspector!

787
01:04:00,631 --> 01:04:02,927
- Mr. Vijay and Ajay. - Yes.
- We want to search this house.

788
01:04:02,951 --> 01:04:07,139
- What? - Search!
- What is left with us to make you search?

789
01:04:07,219 --> 01:04:09,666
- It's done at night.
- You can give your clarification..

790
01:04:09,746 --> 01:04:11,391
At the police station.

791
01:04:11,714 --> 01:04:14,071
- Mr. D'souza. Search the entire house.
- Yes, sir.

792
01:04:17,935 --> 01:04:21,455
Mr. Ajay and Mr.
Vijay. Did you see..

793
01:04:21,535 --> 01:04:23,431
How far Law can reach?

794
01:04:23,733 --> 01:04:26,090
No matter how long it may be..

795
01:04:26,170 --> 01:04:28,360
But it can never reach
to a decent man's neck.

796
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:31,771
This is the common excuse
of every thief after arrest.

797
01:04:31,976 --> 01:04:33,551
Whereas both of you are arrested.

798
01:04:33,717 --> 01:04:37,309
It'll be very costly for
you to arrest us, Mr. Inspector.

799
01:04:37,389 --> 01:04:40,096
For your information,
I'm not just MA..

800
01:04:40,176 --> 01:04:41,831
But also bachelor of Law.

801
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:45,568
- MA LLB.
- Along with this you're..

802
01:04:45,754 --> 01:04:48,592
Also a thug,
thief, loafer and cheater.

803
01:04:50,706 --> 01:04:52,845
I feel like laughing on you,
inspector.

804
01:04:53,143 --> 01:04:54,955
Police keep charges on anybody.

805
01:04:55,035 --> 01:04:58,268
But court decides whether
it's right or wrong.

806
01:04:58,348 --> 01:05:01,076
To which you say Law.

807
01:05:09,383 --> 01:05:11,333
Why? Why did you stop?

808
01:05:12,066 --> 01:05:15,613
And why are you silent now,
Mr. MA. LLB?

809
01:05:16,105 --> 01:05:19,053
This beggar seems
to be police's informer.

810
01:05:19,634 --> 01:05:22,220
- Yes..
- Aye, mister. Mind your language.

811
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:24,333
You're talking with
police commissioner Khanna.

812
01:05:25,044 --> 01:05:28,293
Commissioner! Salute, sir.

813
01:05:29,346 --> 01:05:33,201
Any big criminal can
stammer in presence of police.

814
01:05:35,083 --> 01:05:36,939
You're just a child.

815
01:05:37,556 --> 01:05:39,213
You're right, commissioner sir.

816
01:05:39,293 --> 01:05:42,474
And you explain them
about how decent we're.

817
01:05:42,554 --> 01:05:46,046
Yes! And the proof
of your decency is with me.

818
01:05:55,341 --> 01:06:00,381
- "Till now you had forgotten god."
- Yes.

819
01:06:01,322 --> 01:06:04,341
"Till now you had forgotten god."

820
01:06:04,781 --> 01:06:08,341
"Now you've started praying him.."

821
01:06:09,650 --> 01:06:12,745
"When you realised
your wealth is decreasing."

822
01:06:13,341 --> 01:06:16,021
"And that made you restless."

823
01:06:16,909 --> 01:06:19,621
Commissioner sir! it's not
a crime to sing a devotional song.

824
01:06:19,927 --> 01:06:23,375
Not at all, masters.
But taking up a bogus inspector's..

825
01:06:23,455 --> 01:06:26,863
'Yes, Inspector Hirachand
and Virachand..'

826
01:06:27,093 --> 01:06:30,751
'..from CBI.
'Sabji Mandi.' New Delhi.'

827
01:06:31,084 --> 01:06:34,453
'And constable Pandu.
Police station, Nagpada. Mumbai.'

828
01:06:35,149 --> 01:06:37,029
To say and to act are
two different things, sir.

829
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:40,141
And that's why Law punishes
on the basis of proof.

830
01:06:40,221 --> 01:06:41,261
Very true!

831
01:06:41,646 --> 01:06:44,046
Mr. MA LLB,
those notes worth 50000..

832
01:06:44,126 --> 01:06:45,691
Have police's marking.

833
01:06:46,248 --> 01:06:48,846
And by now it must
have got your fingerprints.

834
01:06:50,356 --> 01:06:52,301
Sir, we searched their
entire house minutely.

835
01:06:52,381 --> 01:06:53,686
But notes are not found there.

836
01:06:53,766 --> 01:06:55,246
They didn't find anything. Nothing.

837
01:06:55,326 --> 01:06:57,246
No? How's it possible?

838
01:06:57,547 --> 01:06:58,806
Shall I tell you, sir?

839
01:06:59,907 --> 01:07:04,122
"Keep in mind what sages say."

840
01:07:04,202 --> 01:07:08,326
"Keep in mind what sages say."

841
01:07:08,406 --> 01:07:12,406
"It's better for you."

842
01:07:12,486 --> 01:07:14,374
"It's better for you."

843
01:07:15,116 --> 01:07:16,526
How long will you survive?

844
01:07:17,711 --> 01:07:20,517
We could release from here.
Now Miss Kiran's turn.

845
01:07:20,597 --> 01:07:24,486
- Give me that address.
- Address? I ate the address.

846
01:07:24,882 --> 01:07:27,975
- Ate?
- Yes. Take it out. - Wait.

847
01:07:32,967 --> 01:07:38,175
Wait! Look at there.
Look there only.

848
01:07:40,039 --> 01:07:42,686
- It came out.
- It has come out.

849
01:07:44,009 --> 01:07:48,696
Here it is. 47 avenue. Ok.

850
01:07:48,883 --> 01:07:50,620
Listen, I'll go upstairs.

851
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:51,851
And you wait for me at downstairs.

852
01:07:51,875 --> 01:07:54,380
If I won't come back
after half an hour then..

853
01:07:57,399 --> 01:07:58,839
- Shall we go then?
- Ok. - Let's go.

854
01:08:05,370 --> 01:08:06,516
Please, come in.

855
01:08:15,013 --> 01:08:17,934
- Where's madam?
- She's coming. Please, be seated.

856
01:08:26,924 --> 01:08:28,995
- Please sit down, Mr. Vijay.
- Thank you.

857
01:08:29,970 --> 01:08:31,065
How do you know my name?

858
01:08:31,148 --> 01:08:32,738
The guest like yours name..

859
01:08:33,134 --> 01:08:35,507
Is known to everybody
in this house.

860
01:08:36,915 --> 01:08:40,265
I was waiting for you.
Please be seated.

861
01:08:42,718 --> 01:08:44,034
Please, come.

862
01:08:46,538 --> 01:08:52,819
What will you drink and how?
With soda, water or neat?

863
01:08:53,542 --> 01:08:56,028
I'm sorry but I never
drink liquor alone.

864
01:08:57,209 --> 01:08:59,760
It's your fault and not mine.

865
01:09:00,356 --> 01:09:02,239
You didn't bring
your partner with you.

866
01:09:06,170 --> 01:09:07,948
It seems he has stuck up there.

867
01:09:11,162 --> 01:09:12,827
- Please sit down.
- Thank you.

868
01:09:16,010 --> 01:09:17,930
I knew you'd come alone.

869
01:09:18,491 --> 01:09:20,638
And that's why I've
served two plates.

870
01:09:20,718 --> 01:09:22,250
Now let's come to the point.

871
01:09:23,410 --> 01:09:26,330
It seems you want to say something.

872
01:09:26,890 --> 01:09:28,810
I didn't wish to say.
But let me tell you now.

873
01:09:30,053 --> 01:09:32,810
If you'd have stolen
my mind instead of money..

874
01:09:33,330 --> 01:09:35,970
Then 50000 would
be of no value to you.

875
01:09:36,689 --> 01:09:39,929
I always believe in solid proof.

876
01:09:40,606 --> 01:09:44,107
Show me the skills of your mind.
Then I'll fix the rate.

877
01:09:44,410 --> 01:09:45,690
Not only you but the entire..

878
01:09:45,770 --> 01:09:47,610
World will be
ready to rate my mind.

879
01:09:47,970 --> 01:09:50,010
Can you see this?

880
01:09:52,010 --> 01:09:53,850
Two pinch of the
content of this bottle..

881
01:09:54,050 --> 01:09:56,090
If added to water
it become a fuel.

882
01:09:56,850 --> 01:09:58,001
Impossible.

883
01:09:58,179 --> 01:10:00,767
Rates are fixed for converting
impossible into possible.

884
01:10:01,250 --> 01:10:02,970
In future,
all the cars of the world will..

885
01:10:03,050 --> 01:10:05,370
Run with the water
mixed with this content.

886
01:10:05,824 --> 01:10:08,004
Future is never sure, Mr. Vijay?

887
01:10:08,084 --> 01:10:10,210
- But present is always yours, madam.
- Ok.

888
01:10:10,896 --> 01:10:14,003
- Only two pinch. In presence of you.
- Ok.

889
01:10:14,628 --> 01:10:16,250
- Then?
- Ready?

890
01:10:18,355 --> 01:10:19,355
Fabulous.

891
01:10:20,106 --> 01:10:22,600
My god! We can rob
the entire world like this.

892
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:27,957
- It's my mind and not yours.
- Oh, I see.

893
01:10:29,129 --> 01:10:30,669
How much will be the advance..

894
01:10:30,749 --> 01:10:32,490
I must pay to
you to keep my share?

895
01:10:33,233 --> 01:10:34,703
Add 2.5 in the amount
that you brought from my house.

896
01:10:34,727 --> 01:10:38,473
You can take away 5. I know
to appreciate the intelligence.

897
01:10:39,045 --> 01:10:41,221
- Thank you!
- I'll just be in a moment. Ok?

898
01:10:47,265 --> 01:10:51,571
So, miss Suzie,
how did you find my magic bottle?

899
01:10:51,651 --> 01:10:53,811
But how did you
come to know my name?

900
01:10:54,138 --> 01:10:56,651
- Just how you came to know mine.
- Oh!

901
01:10:57,691 --> 01:10:59,771
- So, I was telling you..
- Here we're, Mr. Vijay.

902
01:10:59,851 --> 01:11:01,864
- Thank you!
- Take this.

903
01:11:08,853 --> 01:11:15,537
- Mr. Vijay! All are real.
- Ok. then.

904
01:11:16,929 --> 01:11:20,397
- See you.
- Have the dinner first.

905
01:11:20,648 --> 01:11:23,440
Now we'll daily take your dinner,
madam. Bye!

906
01:11:24,229 --> 01:11:25,318
Bye!

907
01:11:32,670 --> 01:11:33,670
Ajay?

908
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:38,040
Ajay!

909
01:11:40,604 --> 01:11:41,971
Where he must have gone?

910
01:11:48,465 --> 01:11:49,816
Where's Ajay, Miss Kiran?

911
01:11:52,090 --> 01:11:53,776
You seem to be very angry, sir.

912
01:11:54,852 --> 01:11:57,590
- May God bless you!
- Where's Ajay, miss Kiran?

913
01:11:58,746 --> 01:12:00,468
May your pair remain untouched.

914
01:12:03,244 --> 01:12:06,310
I was going to ask
you this question.

915
01:12:06,483 --> 01:12:09,830
- That your partner..
- Ajay is more than a brother to me.

916
01:12:11,630 --> 01:12:16,221
I'm impressed.
What happened to your brother?

917
01:12:17,586 --> 01:12:19,070
Don't try to act smart.

918
01:12:19,870 --> 01:12:22,390
If anything will happen to him,
I'll kill you.

919
01:12:23,190 --> 01:12:26,310
I liked this style of yours.
You've declared the..

920
01:12:27,369 --> 01:12:31,592
Punishment without
charging the crime.

921
01:12:32,190 --> 01:12:33,726
Ajay is missing from the
gate of your building from..

922
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:35,950
Yesterday night and he
didn't come home entire night.

923
01:12:38,031 --> 01:12:40,190
God knows how he must
have spent his night?

924
01:12:41,199 --> 01:12:44,345
Yesterday, I couldn't
sleep for the entire night..

925
01:12:45,325 --> 01:12:47,802
After just two meetings
with you till now.

926
01:12:48,519 --> 01:12:50,150
You're dialing a wrong number.

927
01:12:51,422 --> 01:12:55,350
I never weigh my
friend with beauty.

928
01:12:56,102 --> 01:13:01,162
Mind it. I'm not that
type of a girl. I'm a buyer.

929
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:04,570
And I've paid you
5 lakh rupee cash.

930
01:13:04,846 --> 01:13:07,332
Don't live under impression
that you've bought something.

931
01:13:08,233 --> 01:13:09,793
You had asked for the partnership..

932
01:13:10,593 --> 01:13:11,993
To convert 5 into 50.

933
01:13:13,633 --> 01:13:16,033
Over smartness is not
allowed amongst robbers.

934
01:13:16,753 --> 01:13:19,524
And even thief never
trust the thief..

935
01:13:19,913 --> 01:13:21,993
Who does the thievery
at thief's house..

936
01:13:22,073 --> 01:13:24,049
People like you must
be doing this thievery, madam.

937
01:13:24,073 --> 01:13:27,157
I never do any thievery.
I'm expert in swapping.

938
01:13:27,237 --> 01:13:28,953
And that too openly.

939
01:13:30,033 --> 01:13:31,393
And now it comes to Ajay.

940
01:13:31,793 --> 01:13:35,273
If he won't return
home by today evening..

941
01:13:35,521 --> 01:13:39,553
Then I'll use my
hands instead of mind.

942
01:13:40,073 --> 01:13:41,793
And I can confidently say that..

943
01:13:42,126 --> 01:13:45,713
It's as sharp and strong as my..

944
01:13:53,068 --> 01:13:54,068
Ajay!

945
01:13:55,227 --> 01:13:56,227
Ajay!

946
01:13:56,307 --> 01:14:00,033
- Ajay!
- Who's it? Let me sleep.

947
01:14:00,113 --> 01:14:02,313
Stupid, you've spoiled
my sleep and now you're sleeping?

948
01:14:02,353 --> 01:14:03,353
C'mon, get up.

949
01:14:04,089 --> 01:14:05,089
Get up!

950
01:14:05,753 --> 01:14:06,753
Get up!

951
01:14:13,953 --> 01:14:18,909
I'm here?
I was there. Who brought me here?

952
01:14:19,329 --> 01:14:20,508
Where were you?

953
01:14:21,103 --> 01:14:23,183
I was waiting for you
outside Kiran's house.

954
01:14:23,538 --> 01:14:25,458
What are you saying?
That's a story of yesterday.

955
01:14:25,485 --> 01:14:26,835
Where were you in between?

956
01:14:28,203 --> 01:14:29,611
- Yesterday?
- Yes.

957
01:14:31,008 --> 01:14:32,457
Tell me. What had happened?

958
01:14:33,596 --> 01:14:36,997
A blast and then
everything turn into dark.

959
01:14:39,110 --> 01:14:43,433
- You're injured here.
- Oh, yes.

960
01:14:43,944 --> 01:14:45,008
Now I remember.

961
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:47,479
I was waiting for you
and suddenly I felt a stroke..

962
01:14:47,559 --> 01:14:48,853
On my head. And I got faint.

963
01:14:48,933 --> 01:14:52,039
Faint? Who were they?
Where they had taken you?

964
01:14:52,639 --> 01:14:53,959
I don't know about that.

965
01:14:54,039 --> 01:14:55,919
But after that I got
my consciousness now.

966
01:14:56,128 --> 01:14:57,399
No, Ajay, it's not possible.

967
01:14:57,479 --> 01:14:59,679
Think over it. Who were they?
Where they had taken you?

968
01:15:01,196 --> 01:15:02,492
No, Vijay.
I just can't remember anything.

969
01:15:02,516 --> 01:15:04,626
You'll, Ajay.
Just stress your mind.

970
01:15:04,706 --> 01:15:07,359
- Where they had taken you?
- No, I can't remember anything.

971
01:15:08,058 --> 01:15:09,359
Do you doubt anybody?

972
01:15:09,623 --> 01:15:13,239
Not just doubt. But I'm
quite sure that it's Kiran's plot.

973
01:15:13,881 --> 01:15:16,119
Kiran? What this Kiran is?

974
01:15:20,628 --> 01:15:23,951
Thank you very much for given me..

975
01:15:24,511 --> 01:15:26,551
So much of importance.

976
01:15:28,659 --> 01:15:32,831
You must be surprised
about how did I come here?

977
01:15:33,591 --> 01:15:39,471
Mr. Vijay! After the first visit,
frequent visit is common.

978
01:15:40,679 --> 01:15:43,376
This is the amount that
you'd taken away from me..

979
01:15:43,751 --> 01:15:45,431
For converting water into fuel.

980
01:15:46,535 --> 01:15:50,274
No! No! No!
I could have taken it away.

981
01:15:50,792 --> 01:15:53,231
But no! Do you know why?

982
01:15:54,496 --> 01:15:57,156
Because only jeweller
can value the diamond.

983
01:15:57,731 --> 01:16:03,005
Whereas, both of you
are precious diamonds.

984
01:16:04,054 --> 01:16:08,990
If you're ready to work
with me then this is the token..

985
01:16:09,070 --> 01:16:12,969
Otherwise.. otherwise these..

986
01:16:13,049 --> 01:16:16,751
Money will
automatically come to me.

987
01:16:17,543 --> 01:16:20,311
Gentleman,
now the ball is in your coat.

988
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:25,511
Decision will be yours. Ok? Bye!

989
01:16:30,344 --> 01:16:32,001
Did you understand what is she?

990
01:16:33,687 --> 01:16:37,921
What? 5 lakh?
Have you bought diamonds?

991
01:16:38,754 --> 01:16:43,441
I've bought them for you.
Two precious diamonds.

992
01:16:43,822 --> 01:16:45,102
Have you tested them?

993
01:16:45,418 --> 01:16:47,102
What if they are
proved a glass piece?

994
01:16:48,342 --> 01:16:53,582
Kiran never failed to
test glass pieces and diamonds.

995
01:16:53,822 --> 01:16:54,902
I know that.

996
01:16:56,582 --> 01:16:59,222
But, miss Kiran. I want the proof.

997
01:17:00,422 --> 01:17:01,422
A solid proof.

998
01:17:03,222 --> 01:17:06,582
Ace! King!

999
01:17:08,502 --> 01:17:10,662
Queen is here, sir.

1000
01:17:12,902 --> 01:17:13,942
And here too.

1001
01:17:15,702 --> 01:17:19,880
But where are you?
Over there or here?

1002
01:17:20,337 --> 01:17:22,056
Wherever the market is hot.

1003
01:17:23,102 --> 01:17:24,302
Excuse me, gentleman!

1004
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:27,860
Ok, tell me.

1005
01:17:28,694 --> 01:17:31,874
Have you decided then?
Will you work for us or..

1006
01:17:31,954 --> 01:17:34,582
If we didn't intend
to do then your notes..

1007
01:17:34,662 --> 01:17:37,070
Would have come
to you by now. Right?

1008
01:17:37,954 --> 01:17:40,462
May your pair be graced!

1009
01:17:41,041 --> 01:17:44,276
Have you come out from
earth or dropped from sky?

1010
01:17:44,356 --> 01:17:45,982
It's a question of 5 lakh, madam.

1011
01:17:46,185 --> 01:17:48,358
Now I'll drop from
anywhere you say.

1012
01:17:48,785 --> 01:17:50,552
- Will you do the robbery?
- Sure!

1013
01:17:50,936 --> 01:17:52,973
- Will you rob the bank?
- In a daylight.

1014
01:17:53,275 --> 01:17:56,979
- And hijacking?
- If you'd be with us..

1015
01:17:57,915 --> 01:17:59,302
- Will you do any murder?
- Yes..

1016
01:17:59,382 --> 01:18:01,053
- No! No murder..
- Shut up!

1017
01:18:01,251 --> 01:18:02,398
How many times I explained
you not to interfere..

1018
01:18:02,422 --> 01:18:03,922
- While dealing the business?
- She's telling us to murder.

1019
01:18:03,946 --> 01:18:04,946
Ok, madam.

1020
01:18:05,954 --> 01:18:07,474
I don't mind murdering anybody..

1021
01:18:07,554 --> 01:18:09,394
As it is your
beauty has killed me.

1022
01:18:10,285 --> 01:18:12,434
Tell me who do you
want me to murder?

1023
01:18:12,698 --> 01:18:15,234
We'll tell you that with times.

1024
01:18:15,314 --> 01:18:18,514
- Then now..
- For now you can go back..

1025
01:18:18,594 --> 01:18:21,154
To your other queen if you wish.

1026
01:18:21,874 --> 01:18:24,594
- Bye!
- Bye! - Bye! - Bye!

1027
01:18:24,874 --> 01:18:28,234
Have you gone mad?
She was telling us to murder.

1028
01:18:28,674 --> 01:18:30,514
With the sight of a
girl you forget yourself.

1029
01:18:30,914 --> 01:18:32,874
You need to be energetic
to reach your goal..

1030
01:18:32,954 --> 01:18:34,554
And not in your sense.

1031
01:18:34,803 --> 01:18:36,407
- You won't understand.
- What I want understand?

1032
01:18:36,431 --> 01:18:38,954
What's your goal for
which you're ready to murder?

1033
01:18:39,313 --> 01:18:41,893
Ajay, you must not ask
questions in friendship.

1034
01:18:42,291 --> 01:18:44,632
Have your concern with
friendship you'll be happy.

1035
01:18:46,249 --> 01:18:48,898
That means you'll do murder?
I'll see how you do that.

1036
01:18:50,112 --> 01:18:51,938
What's so special in this photo..

1037
01:18:52,392 --> 01:18:55,829
That's making you so excited?

1038
01:18:56,865 --> 01:18:58,354
This is just the sand of our way.

1039
01:18:58,594 --> 01:19:02,393
But it's coming with the tornado.

1040
01:19:05,818 --> 01:19:09,966
Before this sand comes
to us with this tornado..

1041
01:19:10,654 --> 01:19:15,618
Find out from where
this sand has come?

1042
01:19:16,429 --> 01:19:18,418
And by what speed
it's coming to us?

1043
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:23,390
C'mon, run!

1044
01:19:24,793 --> 01:19:26,651
- Ajay!
- What happened? Are you tired?

1045
01:19:27,262 --> 01:19:29,458
I'm not Hanuman's
devotee like you..

1046
01:19:29,538 --> 01:19:30,858
That I can keep running?

1047
01:19:30,938 --> 01:19:36,068
Look, Asha, if you taunt me
I'll start with my devotion again.

1048
01:19:36,148 --> 01:19:38,068
Then you'll remain unmarried
in your entire life.

1049
01:19:38,290 --> 01:19:39,290
No way!

1050
01:19:39,377 --> 01:19:41,570
Now I can't live without you
for even a moment.

1051
01:19:41,650 --> 01:19:42,810
- Really?
- Yes.

1052
01:19:44,490 --> 01:19:46,610
I love you, Asha! I love you.

1053
01:19:48,090 --> 01:19:51,730
This locket? What's the matter?

1054
01:19:52,279 --> 01:19:54,410
Whose symbol you're
carrying along with you?

1055
01:19:55,130 --> 01:19:58,810
Asha, this is the only
one symbol I've of my parents.

1056
01:20:00,105 --> 01:20:03,953
- My father had sold me off in my childhood.
- What?

1057
01:20:04,650 --> 01:20:06,610
A father sold off his son?

1058
01:20:06,930 --> 01:20:09,656
No, Asha. Don't misunderstand him.

1059
01:20:10,770 --> 01:20:12,250
My mother was very serious.

1060
01:20:13,010 --> 01:20:14,730
We didn't have money
for her treatment.

1061
01:20:15,669 --> 01:20:17,130
I remember very little.

1062
01:20:18,061 --> 01:20:20,650
Papa snatched me
away from mother's hand.

1063
01:20:21,251 --> 01:20:22,421
Mummy, screamed..

1064
01:20:22,501 --> 01:20:24,646
That let me die
but don't sell my child.

1065
01:20:25,766 --> 01:20:28,817
Papa cried and hugged
me tightly for the last time.

1066
01:20:29,128 --> 01:20:30,671
Then what happened?

1067
01:20:31,392 --> 01:20:35,406
Those who had bought me,
also died after some time.

1068
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:38,200
And I became an orphan.

1069
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:43,160
I worked hard in daytime and
studied in the streetlight at night.

1070
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:46,160
I obtain the degree of MA.
LLB. But I failed..

1071
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:47,840
To continue with my practise.

1072
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:50,760
I tried to commit
suicide at the last.

1073
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:54,560
But Vijay saved my life.

1074
01:20:55,557 --> 01:20:56,960
And I got a new life.

1075
01:20:58,504 --> 01:21:00,800
And then you..

1076
01:21:02,171 --> 01:21:04,560
I can't forget this obligation
of yours in my life.

1077
01:21:04,879 --> 01:21:07,560
Will you bring him home
tonight for the dinner?

1078
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:09,280
Please..

1079
01:21:17,249 --> 01:21:19,569
To prove you that I can cook food..

1080
01:21:19,689 --> 01:21:21,089
I sent the maid home.

1081
01:21:21,329 --> 01:21:22,929
Very good!
Now you, please be seated.

1082
01:21:23,009 --> 01:21:25,169
Some things are left.
I'll just come.

1083
01:21:27,249 --> 01:21:29,248
It seems your prayers
have turned fruitful.

1084
01:21:29,328 --> 01:21:30,328
What a girl she's!

1085
01:21:30,404 --> 01:21:32,044
You also start with
the prayer from today.

1086
01:21:32,124 --> 01:21:33,564
You will also find one like her.

1087
01:21:34,223 --> 01:21:37,044
- She stays alone?
- I didn't ask her.

1088
01:21:37,124 --> 01:21:40,524
- But why are you asking?
- No! It's nothing like that.

1089
01:21:41,051 --> 01:21:42,444
Ajay, please open the door.

1090
01:21:43,456 --> 01:21:44,484
Shall I go?

1091
01:21:51,364 --> 01:21:52,364
Yes, tell me!

1092
01:21:53,659 --> 01:21:54,924
- Police?!
- Police?!

1093
01:21:58,868 --> 01:22:00,644
- Police?! How come they are here?
- See..

1094
01:22:01,876 --> 01:22:03,356
- Commissioner sir!
- Salutation, sir.

1095
01:22:03,564 --> 01:22:05,923
Commissioner, sir.
You're following us everywhere.

1096
01:22:06,205 --> 01:22:07,740
We've come here with
a marriage proposal.

1097
01:22:07,764 --> 01:22:09,524
If you don't believe
me then ask the girl.

1098
01:22:09,882 --> 01:22:11,684
How dare you step in this house?

1099
01:22:11,924 --> 01:22:14,364
You're asking us as if
we've entered in your house.

1100
01:22:14,444 --> 01:22:20,324
Mr. MA. LLB. Today you'll
forget all the books Law.

1101
01:22:20,904 --> 01:22:22,764
- Arrest them.
- Excuse me!

1102
01:22:24,164 --> 01:22:25,484
Don't misunderstand them.

1103
01:22:25,564 --> 01:22:28,284
- I've invited them for dinner, brother.
- Brother?!

1104
01:22:28,885 --> 01:22:30,764
Please don't bother
about the dinner.

1105
01:22:30,844 --> 01:22:33,044
- Only one glass of water will be fine.
- Water?

1106
01:22:33,124 --> 01:22:35,244
Can we have a glass of water,
brother?

1107
01:22:36,081 --> 01:22:38,004
Asha, from when do you know them?

1108
01:22:38,795 --> 01:22:40,924
- From the day he has saved my life.
- Yes.

1109
01:22:41,628 --> 01:22:44,324
How can the infamous person
take care of anybody's prestige?

1110
01:22:44,991 --> 01:22:46,220
Those who have unmarried
sisters and daughters..

1111
01:22:46,244 --> 01:22:48,124
At home should think
before giving opinions.

1112
01:22:49,804 --> 01:22:51,014
What's this, Asha?

1113
01:22:51,537 --> 01:22:53,221
I was going to tell
you everything, brother.

1114
01:22:53,245 --> 01:22:54,245
Shut up!

1115
01:22:55,998 --> 01:22:57,204
Get out!

1116
01:22:58,154 --> 01:23:01,152
I'll shoot you if I see
you in this house again. Out!

1117
01:23:03,108 --> 01:23:04,204
Thank you, Asha.

1118
01:23:07,515 --> 01:23:09,364
You didn't do this right, brother.

1119
01:23:11,448 --> 01:23:14,764
Enough, I've heard
everything after this.

1120
01:23:16,971 --> 01:23:20,124
You go and send Sherry to me.

1121
01:23:20,702 --> 01:23:24,324
- Have I done any mistake, sir?
- No! Your stars have favoured you.

1122
01:23:25,075 --> 01:23:27,356
I'll award you much
gold for this information.

1123
01:23:27,959 --> 01:23:30,477
Thank you!
Thank you very much, sir.

1124
01:23:31,992 --> 01:23:35,886
Isn't it necessary
to meet Ajay personally..

1125
01:23:35,966 --> 01:23:38,080
Before rewarding him?

1126
01:23:38,411 --> 01:23:41,956
No, Sherry. Whatever
Ajay has told to that girl.

1127
01:23:42,133 --> 01:23:44,894
He can't be anybody
else other than my son.

1128
01:23:45,599 --> 01:23:48,304
What will happen now?
He's enemy's friend.

1129
01:23:50,088 --> 01:23:51,876
Then make him an enemy.
Did you get it?

1130
01:24:54,763 --> 01:24:55,763
Hello!

1131
01:24:56,820 --> 01:24:57,936
Hello!

1132
01:24:58,016 --> 01:25:01,201
You can't escape
from your death, Sherry.

1133
01:25:01,925 --> 01:25:05,117
And I'll be the cause
of your death. Key!

1134
01:25:14,826 --> 01:25:16,037
Take the right turn.

1135
01:25:17,888 --> 01:25:19,470
I said turn towards right.

1136
01:25:20,310 --> 01:25:22,790
Car turns by steering
and not by the order.

1137
01:25:22,870 --> 01:25:24,710
And at present steering
is in my control.

1138
01:25:25,430 --> 01:25:27,590
That's why I'm telling
you to turn towards right.

1139
01:25:28,110 --> 01:25:30,101
It seems you didn't
read the newspaper today.

1140
01:25:30,550 --> 01:25:32,190
Yesterday night,
a murder took place.

1141
01:25:32,849 --> 01:25:34,470
And the dead body is still missing.

1142
01:25:35,005 --> 01:25:37,670
Keep quiet. Otherwise,
same thing can happen with you.

1143
01:25:38,510 --> 01:25:40,630
Whether it happens with me or not..

1144
01:25:41,270 --> 01:25:43,470
But I know about that dead body.

1145
01:25:44,710 --> 01:25:47,430
If you don't mind,
just turn back and see.

1146
01:25:56,110 --> 01:25:58,430
Dead body is lying in the car.
Police is following the car.

1147
01:25:58,661 --> 01:26:02,688
And you're on the driving seat.
Good luck! Goodbye!

1148
01:26:58,766 --> 01:27:01,166
Cheating with Law is not so easy,
Mr. Vijay.

1149
01:27:01,322 --> 01:27:03,966
Inspector, I'm innocent.
I didn't do this murder.

1150
01:27:04,046 --> 01:27:05,542
This car is also not mined.
It's a plotting against me.

1151
01:27:05,566 --> 01:27:07,566
- Court will decide that. C'mon.
- Look, inspector!

1152
01:27:07,646 --> 01:27:09,606
- Constable, take care of this car.
- Ok, sir.

1153
01:27:26,046 --> 01:27:31,086
O god! When wills this
crime and murders end?

1154
01:27:32,526 --> 01:27:34,311
Let's see the dead body once.

1155
01:27:34,406 --> 01:27:39,326
- No! I get scared.
- It's just a dead body and not a ghost.

1156
01:27:39,622 --> 01:27:40,926
My situation becomes awkward..

1157
01:27:41,006 --> 01:27:42,461
When I see the dead bodies.

1158
01:27:42,844 --> 01:27:44,480
If I'll see this dead body.

1159
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:46,349
I won't be able to
sleep for the entire night.

1160
01:27:46,373 --> 01:27:47,886
I'll get the fever.

1161
01:27:47,973 --> 01:27:50,169
You're very strange.

1162
01:27:50,918 --> 01:27:53,486
God may not give
sorrows to anybody.

1163
01:27:53,957 --> 01:27:56,846
Only then the constable like
me won't be found in this area.

1164
01:27:56,926 --> 01:27:58,486
You know that.
C'mon light my cigarette.

1165
01:27:58,566 --> 01:27:59,766
Come on, give it to me.

1166
01:27:59,846 --> 01:28:01,686
I wish nobody to have
sorrowful days in life.

1167
01:28:01,766 --> 01:28:03,566
- Please light the cigarette.
- Yes, sure.

1168
01:28:05,789 --> 01:28:08,006
- Thanks!
- No mention.

1169
01:28:08,246 --> 01:28:11,406
Yes, it was very nice.
Too good! Ajay!

1170
01:28:13,286 --> 01:28:14,286
Aju!

1171
01:28:15,338 --> 01:28:16,735
Are you talking to me?

1172
01:28:17,957 --> 01:28:20,086
Are you still disappointed
with brother's behaviour?

1173
01:28:20,564 --> 01:28:22,166
So much of anger on my love?

1174
01:28:22,874 --> 01:28:25,246
- But I love your anger, too.
- Look!

1175
01:28:25,833 --> 01:28:27,926
I think your Ajay's
face resembles mine.

1176
01:28:28,266 --> 01:28:29,825
I'm seeing you for the first time.

1177
01:28:29,905 --> 01:28:31,686
Sir, madam is calling you.

1178
01:28:34,366 --> 01:28:36,126
Tell her I'm coming.
Did you hear this?

1179
01:28:36,206 --> 01:28:38,806
Now you must have understood.

1180
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:42,566
Ajay! Ajay, I'm Asha! Your Asha.

1181
01:28:43,213 --> 01:28:44,926
I don't know any Asha!

1182
01:28:45,953 --> 01:28:47,086
Ajay!

1183
01:28:50,121 --> 01:28:51,246
Tell me!

1184
01:28:51,685 --> 01:28:54,766
Your friend is in the lock
up under the charge of a murder.

1185
01:28:55,221 --> 01:28:58,606
If anything will happen to Vijay,
I'll kill you very first.

1186
01:28:58,987 --> 01:29:01,366
Yes, sure! You can kill me.

1187
01:29:01,575 --> 01:29:03,731
But shall I drop you
to the police station first?

1188
01:29:03,811 --> 01:29:06,166
Please, come. C'mon.

1189
01:29:11,852 --> 01:29:15,172
It was my craziness
that I loved you.

1190
01:29:16,212 --> 01:29:21,812
I will forget you.
Brother was right.

1191
01:29:22,549 --> 01:29:24,452
You're a liar. A decisive.

1192
01:29:26,452 --> 01:29:28,692
I'll tell brother
to send you to the lock up.

1193
01:29:29,252 --> 01:29:30,452
Only then you'll realise.

1194
01:29:31,877 --> 01:29:35,812
That innocence of
yours and bashful look.

1195
01:29:36,412 --> 01:29:39,012
I'll also tear off your letter.

1196
01:29:53,249 --> 01:30:00,732
"Somebody has written
a love letter to me."

1197
01:30:00,812 --> 01:30:06,372
"Somebody has written
a love letter to me."

1198
01:30:06,452 --> 01:30:11,692
"It states that he's crazy for me."

1199
01:30:11,908 --> 01:30:14,252
"Today,
when he met me personally.."

1200
01:30:14,332 --> 01:30:16,932
"He isn't speaking anything."

1201
01:30:17,346 --> 01:30:23,012
"I don't understand
this style of him"

1202
01:30:23,092 --> 01:30:29,292
"Somebody has written
a love letter to me."

1203
01:30:50,932 --> 01:30:57,252
"He looks at me
with so much of love."

1204
01:30:59,462 --> 01:31:04,772
"He looks at me
with so much of love."

1205
01:31:05,029 --> 01:31:10,372
"But when I look at
him he avoids meeting eyes."

1206
01:31:10,527 --> 01:31:15,932
"Actually, he loves me a lot."

1207
01:31:16,012 --> 01:31:21,332
"Actually, he loves me a lot."

1208
01:31:21,568 --> 01:31:26,952
"If anybody try to tease me,
he never spare them."

1209
01:31:27,032 --> 01:31:29,372
"What this secret is.."

1210
01:31:32,688 --> 01:31:35,075
"What this secret is.."

1211
01:31:35,155 --> 01:31:38,214
"Do you know what
it means actually?

1212
01:31:38,294 --> 01:31:43,589
"I don't understand
this style of him"

1213
01:31:43,669 --> 01:31:49,852
"Somebody has written
a love letter to me."

1214
01:32:08,597 --> 01:32:14,498
"Those who feel shy with
the sight of a beautiful lady."

1215
01:32:16,931 --> 01:32:22,334
"Those who feel shy with
the sight of a beautiful lady."

1216
01:32:22,414 --> 01:32:27,850
"How can he claim to be in love?"

1217
01:32:27,930 --> 01:32:33,411
"What a sweetheart I've got?"

1218
01:32:33,491 --> 01:32:38,927
"What a sweetheart I've got?"

1219
01:32:39,007 --> 01:32:43,985
"Such lovers are very
rare in this world."

1220
01:32:44,513 --> 01:32:46,892
"He's very mean.."

1221
01:32:49,985 --> 01:32:55,441
"He has a new style
of attracting me."

1222
01:32:55,521 --> 01:33:01,510
"I don't understand
this style of him"

1223
01:33:03,711 --> 01:33:09,253
"Somebody has written
a love letter to me."

1224
01:33:09,333 --> 01:33:14,813
"It states that he's crazy for me."

1225
01:33:14,893 --> 01:33:17,364
"Today,
when he met me personally.."

1226
01:33:17,444 --> 01:33:20,144
"He isn't speaking anything."

1227
01:33:20,487 --> 01:33:26,003
"I don't understand
this style of him"

1228
01:33:26,083 --> 01:33:32,292
"Somebody has written
a love letter to me."

1229
01:33:37,591 --> 01:33:38,711
Ajay, you and here?

1230
01:33:39,071 --> 01:33:40,591
Who told you that I'm locked here?

1231
01:33:42,831 --> 01:33:45,831
That, smart woman.

1232
01:33:46,151 --> 01:33:47,511
Oh! Kiran!

1233
01:33:50,212 --> 01:33:54,071
That means she also
knows him very well.

1234
01:33:54,607 --> 01:33:56,871
- Whom?
- Nobody.

1235
01:33:58,098 --> 01:34:01,391
Ajay, I've told you this before
and even today I'm telling you.

1236
01:34:02,111 --> 01:34:03,351
Please forget me.

1237
01:34:04,191 --> 01:34:06,071
You won't get anything
other than defame..

1238
01:34:06,151 --> 01:34:07,751
With the company of a criminal.

1239
01:34:08,111 --> 01:34:12,031
No, Vijay! I've forgotten her,
whom I should have.

1240
01:34:13,071 --> 01:34:14,751
I've refused to recognise Asha.

1241
01:34:15,071 --> 01:34:18,071
Ajay! What did you do this?
You can never get such a nice girl..

1242
01:34:18,151 --> 01:34:20,471
And family being in my company.

1243
01:34:21,191 --> 01:34:23,071
Vijay! Which is that
secret that's more than..

1244
01:34:23,151 --> 01:34:25,271
Our friendship for you.

1245
01:34:25,351 --> 01:34:26,871
Even after the murder charges..

1246
01:34:26,951 --> 01:34:28,391
You don't want to disclose it.

1247
01:34:28,471 --> 01:34:32,191
It's not a secret. It's a fact.
I'm involved in a murder case.

1248
01:34:32,791 --> 01:34:34,351
And now my bail
is also not possible.

1249
01:34:34,431 --> 01:34:37,631
Why it isn't possible?
I'll do anything to give your bail.

1250
01:34:37,711 --> 01:34:39,431
You've got the bail.
Sir has called you.

1251
01:34:41,711 --> 01:34:44,111
Please, come sir.
You please sit here.

1252
01:34:44,191 --> 01:34:46,591
Constable has gone to bring him.
He'll come soon.

1253
01:34:46,671 --> 01:34:47,791
Thank you!

1254
01:34:58,488 --> 01:34:59,791
Uncle! You?

1255
01:35:01,551 --> 01:35:03,191
May you have a long life, my child!

1256
01:35:15,271 --> 01:35:17,311
Won't you come in my hug, my child?

1257
01:35:18,759 --> 01:35:20,871
Vijay, I didn't recognise him.

1258
01:35:20,951 --> 01:35:22,668
Ajay, he's Mr. Ghanshyam Das.

1259
01:35:22,748 --> 01:35:24,207
- A dearest friend of my father.
- Oh!

1260
01:35:24,231 --> 01:35:26,948
- He's the richest and..
- Enough!

1261
01:35:27,028 --> 01:35:30,951
Don't praise me more.
As it is I've put on a lot.

1262
01:35:31,998 --> 01:35:33,412
Pleased to meet you.

1263
01:35:34,110 --> 01:35:37,692
We just can't control
our happiness when we find..

1264
01:35:38,270 --> 01:35:41,612
Somebody from our own
after many years. But, Vijay.

1265
01:35:41,860 --> 01:35:43,732
You really scared me today.

1266
01:35:44,052 --> 01:35:46,212
When I saw police
arresting you on the road..

1267
01:35:46,292 --> 01:35:48,532
I just couldn't
believe on my eyes.

1268
01:35:49,171 --> 01:35:51,292
Right from the
DIG to the inspector.

1269
01:35:51,485 --> 01:35:53,332
I had to convince them that..

1270
01:35:53,412 --> 01:35:55,212
They have
misunderstand something.

1271
01:35:55,292 --> 01:35:57,692
They said dead body
was found in the car.

1272
01:35:57,772 --> 01:35:59,852
I asked them, was it Vijay's car?

1273
01:36:00,115 --> 01:36:02,292
They said no.
But he was driving it.

1274
01:36:02,570 --> 01:36:04,532
When I asked them
about the dead body..

1275
01:36:04,612 --> 01:36:05,892
They said it's disappeared.

1276
01:36:08,449 --> 01:36:09,612
Disappeared?

1277
01:36:10,868 --> 01:36:11,678
Then?

1278
01:36:11,758 --> 01:36:14,692
Then what? I told them
that the day you find the..

1279
01:36:14,772 --> 01:36:17,092
Dead body and prove that
Vijay has murder him then..

1280
01:36:17,172 --> 01:36:19,052
Hang me onto noose
in place of him.

1281
01:36:19,428 --> 01:36:22,508
They kept quiet and I got relief.

1282
01:36:22,588 --> 01:36:26,036
Vijay, my child.
If I hadn't paid your bail today..

1283
01:36:26,116 --> 01:36:27,852
How I'd have faced your mother?

1284
01:36:28,113 --> 01:36:29,372
Mother?

1285
01:36:30,665 --> 01:36:31,852
Vijay's mother?

1286
01:36:32,714 --> 01:36:34,482
Vijay, what type
of a friend you're?

1287
01:36:34,562 --> 01:36:36,550
You didn't introduce
your friend with your mother?

1288
01:36:45,464 --> 01:36:47,024
I'll come to your
house some other day..

1289
01:36:47,092 --> 01:36:48,388
- And explain you everything.
- Why some other day?

1290
01:36:48,412 --> 01:36:50,359
How many days have passed
that you came to Mumbai?

1291
01:36:50,383 --> 01:36:51,692
Nearly a year.

1292
01:36:52,194 --> 01:36:54,932
And you didn't get time
to meet me in this entire year?

1293
01:36:55,513 --> 01:36:57,322
Actually, I was so helpless that..

1294
01:36:57,561 --> 01:36:59,433
Anyway, let it be.
Will you come now?

1295
01:37:00,033 --> 01:37:01,793
And also bring your
mother along with.

1296
01:37:02,153 --> 01:37:03,833
You too, come with him, my child.

1297
01:37:04,313 --> 01:37:07,033
Yes, of course. If he'll bring me,
I'll definitely come.

1298
01:37:07,753 --> 01:37:08,753
Ok then, see you.

1299
01:37:11,953 --> 01:37:14,873
Before taunting you should
have asked me the detail.

1300
01:37:14,953 --> 01:37:17,713
Vijay, my child.
I forgot to ask you something.

1301
01:37:18,139 --> 01:37:20,673
Did you get the information
about your father's murderer?

1302
01:37:23,033 --> 01:37:26,553
If he's alive,
I'll definitely find him one day.

1303
01:37:27,193 --> 01:37:29,833
God knows when that day will come?
Ok then, see you.

1304
01:37:33,671 --> 01:37:37,473
Vijay, how many secrets
you've kept from me?

1305
01:37:38,233 --> 01:37:41,567
And I've considered
you everything of mine.

1306
01:37:42,033 --> 01:37:43,313
I can understand, Ajay.

1307
01:37:43,718 --> 01:37:45,078
If I'd be at your place..

1308
01:37:45,250 --> 01:37:47,210
I also would have felt
hurt to know about this.

1309
01:37:48,100 --> 01:37:51,045
But believe me,
if you'd be at my place..

1310
01:37:51,341 --> 01:37:53,335
You also would have
done the same thing.

1311
01:37:53,415 --> 01:37:57,658
Never, Vijay! You know
that I've always craved for love.

1312
01:37:58,978 --> 01:38:03,164
I've carved for the
parental love in my life.

1313
01:38:04,444 --> 01:38:08,604
And still you did this?
Your mother can't be mine, too?

1314
01:38:09,043 --> 01:38:10,964
No, Ajay. She's your mother.

1315
01:38:11,604 --> 01:38:12,604
But..

1316
01:38:14,164 --> 01:38:16,164
But she has lost her
mental balance with a shock.

1317
01:38:17,364 --> 01:38:20,604
She's not getting
the right treatment.

1318
01:38:22,214 --> 01:38:24,044
Which is that shock to which..

1319
01:38:24,124 --> 01:38:25,884
She's not getting
the right treatment?

1320
01:38:28,724 --> 01:38:30,004
Tell me, Vijay!

1321
01:38:31,124 --> 01:38:33,164
I'll finish off myself
to get her treatment.

1322
01:38:34,084 --> 01:38:35,404
By swear of me. Tell me.

1323
01:38:36,124 --> 01:38:37,804
- Tell me, Vijay. Otherwise..
- Ajay!

1324
01:38:39,164 --> 01:38:40,164
Don't say that.

1325
01:38:40,964 --> 01:38:42,844
I don't have strength
to resist more shocks.

1326
01:38:44,523 --> 01:38:48,484
That black night..

1327
01:38:49,890 --> 01:38:51,738
I was studying in my room.

1328
01:38:52,819 --> 01:38:55,604
Are you talking about
Sir Ghanshyam Das?

1329
01:38:55,871 --> 01:38:59,044
Sir? He's a smuggler,
a murderer, a robber.

1330
01:38:59,373 --> 01:39:01,964
Today I've seen
everything personally.

1331
01:39:02,497 --> 01:39:04,564
See, this is his real picture.

1332
01:39:05,541 --> 01:39:09,084
It's not possible. It can't
be Sir Ghanshyam Das's photo.

1333
01:39:09,966 --> 01:39:11,764
I'm sure this is
a misunderstanding.

1334
01:39:12,604 --> 01:39:13,523
Now take some rest.

1335
01:39:13,603 --> 01:39:15,124
Tomorrow morning
you've to go to Delhi.

1336
01:39:15,324 --> 01:39:19,444
Morning? First I've to
make him arrest in the morning.

1337
01:39:20,039 --> 01:39:22,524
Everybody will believe me..

1338
01:39:23,074 --> 01:39:24,884
When he'll be sentenced to death.

1339
01:39:39,304 --> 01:39:41,564
Mr. Vijay! Mr. Vijay!

1340
01:39:44,539 --> 01:39:46,052
Papa! Papa!

1341
01:39:46,132 --> 01:39:48,204
- Papa, who did this?
- Vijay!

1342
01:39:48,489 --> 01:39:51,044
Vijay, my child, you please
run away from here. Run away!

1343
01:39:51,124 --> 01:39:54,841
He'll kill you. He'll kill me, too.
He'll kill all of us.

1344
01:39:54,921 --> 01:39:56,764
Who, mummy?
Did you see him? who was he?

1345
01:39:57,753 --> 01:40:00,684
Why don't you say something?
Tell me, mummy.

1346
01:40:05,072 --> 01:40:06,629
Why your papa is sleeping here?

1347
01:40:06,709 --> 01:40:08,964
- Take him upstairs.
- Mummy!

1348
01:40:10,264 --> 01:40:11,704
Tomorrow is your exam, I suppose?

1349
01:40:12,264 --> 01:40:14,664
You've still not slept?
What are you doing here?

1350
01:40:14,744 --> 01:40:18,424
- Go and relax now.
- Mummy? - Go! - Mummy!

1351
01:40:18,584 --> 01:40:20,384
- Go to sleep.
- Yes, mummy, I'll go to sleep.

1352
01:40:20,464 --> 01:40:22,344
You please come here, mummy. Come..

1353
01:40:23,504 --> 01:40:24,944
Shanti, please take care of her.

1354
01:40:27,544 --> 01:40:30,864
- Hello!
- Vijay, my child? Ghanshyam here.

1355
01:40:31,424 --> 01:40:32,824
Give the phone to papa.

1356
01:40:32,912 --> 01:40:36,224
- Uncle! Uncle, papa is no more.
- What?

1357
01:40:36,552 --> 01:40:38,784
- Is sister in law alright?
- Mummy!

1358
01:40:39,130 --> 01:40:41,064
Mummy has also gone madly, uncle.

1359
01:40:41,530 --> 01:40:43,424
God knows suddenly what happened..

1360
01:40:50,904 --> 01:40:54,344
Papa! Papa! Papa!

1361
01:41:10,584 --> 01:41:12,544
This man's death is
mother's treatment, right?

1362
01:41:13,304 --> 01:41:15,824
I'll kill him and
bring him to our mother.

1363
01:41:19,145 --> 01:41:22,164
My son has fallen in love with
a girl and that too, which girl?

1364
01:41:22,244 --> 01:41:24,624
With a top most enemy's sister.

1365
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:28,620
He's a friend of one,
and is in love with other's sister.

1366
01:41:29,740 --> 01:41:31,460
Had you seen the locket properly?

1367
01:41:32,580 --> 01:41:37,260
I've seen it, Sherry.
And my eyes are very sharp.

1368
01:41:38,260 --> 01:41:41,220
Ajay is my son and
I'll meet him at any cost.

1369
01:41:42,060 --> 01:41:44,300
Then why don't you meet
him in this appearance?

1370
01:41:44,380 --> 01:41:46,100
He'll be known as
Sir Ghanshyam's son.

1371
01:41:46,729 --> 01:41:48,780
No, Sheery. It's not possible.

1372
01:41:49,642 --> 01:41:51,140
When I had sold him off..

1373
01:41:51,511 --> 01:41:53,500
Sir Ghanshyam
was not in existence.

1374
01:41:54,305 --> 01:41:58,380
- That time I was.. I was..
- But he was too small that time.

1375
01:41:58,780 --> 01:42:00,460
And as per Mack's information,
he doesn't..

1376
01:42:00,540 --> 01:42:02,700
Remember about his
childhood very clearly.

1377
01:42:03,441 --> 01:42:07,380
What will happen if he'd
remember his father's face?

1378
01:42:07,900 --> 01:42:09,100
Then what's use now, PK?

1379
01:42:09,740 --> 01:42:11,900
By now Vijay must
have told him everything.

1380
01:42:12,462 --> 01:42:14,820
And now he must hate PK's face.

1381
01:42:15,606 --> 01:42:18,694
Whether he loves me or hates me.
But he's my son.

1382
01:42:18,774 --> 01:42:22,487
Ok, then let's go to Vijay
and ask your son from him.

1383
01:42:22,567 --> 01:42:25,336
Sheery! Don't cross your limits.

1384
01:42:26,133 --> 01:42:30,580
If I've a fatherly heart.
I also have a dangerous mind.

1385
01:42:31,860 --> 01:42:33,660
I'll go to commissioner
Khanna's house..

1386
01:42:33,740 --> 01:42:35,100
And meet his sister.

1387
01:42:35,180 --> 01:42:37,956
Commissioner Khanna
is searching for you.

1388
01:42:38,152 --> 01:42:40,460
And even then you
want to take this risk?

1389
01:42:41,220 --> 01:42:43,659
I don't mind taking
this risk for my son.

1390
01:43:12,895 --> 01:43:16,367
- Yes! - Is Asha at home?
- Yes, she's. Please come.

1391
01:43:23,311 --> 01:43:24,457
Please, come..

1392
01:43:26,903 --> 01:43:28,297
- Have a seat.
- Thank you!

1393
01:43:29,881 --> 01:43:31,257
What's your name?

1394
01:43:32,016 --> 01:43:35,057
Tell her Ajay's father
wants to meet her.

1395
01:43:35,326 --> 01:43:38,297
Yes! I'm Asha.

1396
01:43:41,613 --> 01:43:43,520
- Long live, my child.
- You.

1397
01:43:43,938 --> 01:43:47,267
My child, I'm the
unfortunate father of Ajay..

1398
01:43:48,989 --> 01:43:53,125
Who can't meet his
son even after finding him.

1399
01:43:53,313 --> 01:43:55,288
What? I didn't get you.

1400
01:43:56,297 --> 01:43:59,133
My child, I need your help.

1401
01:43:59,461 --> 01:44:02,148
I'm sorry. But I can't
help you in this matter.

1402
01:44:03,083 --> 01:44:05,048
I've forgotten Ajay completely.

1403
01:44:05,462 --> 01:44:09,719
I don't want to see his face.
He refused to identify me.

1404
01:44:09,799 --> 01:44:12,303
No, my son can't be like this.

1405
01:44:12,861 --> 01:44:15,100
You don't know. But he's trapped.

1406
01:44:15,373 --> 01:44:17,741
And that's why your brother
is also prejudiced about him.

1407
01:44:18,029 --> 01:44:20,349
He has got a company
of a wrong person.

1408
01:44:20,709 --> 01:44:22,109
And he has prompted him so much..

1409
01:44:22,189 --> 01:44:24,029
- That he considers me his enemy.
- What?

1410
01:44:26,629 --> 01:44:30,549
Only you can convince Ajay.
He'll never refuse you.

1411
01:44:32,229 --> 01:44:33,709
Please bring him to me once.

1412
01:44:34,389 --> 01:44:36,149
I'll clear all
his misunderstanding.

1413
01:44:37,029 --> 01:44:39,229
I'll give him everything
that he hasn't find till today.

1414
01:44:40,989 --> 01:44:44,349
Fatherly love, wealth and fame.

1415
01:44:45,309 --> 01:44:47,389
And your brother also
won't misunderstand him then.

1416
01:44:48,469 --> 01:44:51,509
Please bring him to me once.
I beg of you.

1417
01:44:57,269 --> 01:45:01,829
Lift-man! Lift-man! Just check
the lift! What's wrong with it?

1418
01:45:10,349 --> 01:45:11,709
Sir, you and here?

1419
01:45:12,429 --> 01:45:15,629
Actually, my car was spoiled.
So I thought of meeting you.

1420
01:45:15,709 --> 01:45:18,509
But you, police officers
don't have time for us.

1421
01:45:18,589 --> 01:45:20,229
What are you saying, sir?
C'mon, let's go.

1422
01:45:20,269 --> 01:45:22,029
- No, I met Asha just now.
- Really?

1423
01:45:22,109 --> 01:45:24,136
- Now I'll come with your invitation.
- Ok.

1424
01:45:24,457 --> 01:45:25,538
Ok, bye!

1425
01:45:36,944 --> 01:45:37,989
Asha!

1426
01:45:40,240 --> 01:45:41,861
- Asha!
- Yes, brother!

1427
01:45:42,078 --> 01:45:45,469
Sir had come home.
Did you serve him the best?

1428
01:45:45,549 --> 01:45:47,029
He didn't give that chance.

1429
01:45:47,323 --> 01:45:49,121
He was just telling
me about his misery.

1430
01:45:49,407 --> 01:45:51,721
I wish if you'd be present,
all your misunderstanding..

1431
01:45:51,801 --> 01:45:53,881
- About Ajay would be clear today.
- Ajay?

1432
01:45:55,130 --> 01:45:58,370
- How's Ajay concern with sir?
- He's Ajay's father.

1433
01:45:58,450 --> 01:46:00,450
Ajay had told me everything about him.

1434
01:46:02,370 --> 01:46:05,210
Ajay is the son of this big personality?

1435
01:46:05,290 --> 01:46:07,690
Yes. And he doesn't know about it yet.

1436
01:46:08,170 --> 01:46:10,250
Brother, if you allow me..

1437
01:46:10,650 --> 01:46:12,370
It's very important
for me to meet Ajay.

1438
01:46:12,970 --> 01:46:15,450
- Yes, sure! You can go.
- Thank you, brother!

1439
01:46:18,890 --> 01:46:22,806
But sir never discussed
about his son..

1440
01:46:31,765 --> 01:46:33,250
Come in, my child.

1441
01:46:49,524 --> 01:46:51,210
Why are you standing in dark, papa?

1442
01:46:52,366 --> 01:46:54,770
- Why don't you come in light?
- I'll come, my child.

1443
01:46:55,472 --> 01:46:59,490
But before that I want
to tell you something.

1444
01:47:00,826 --> 01:47:02,770
The face that you'll see now..

1445
01:47:03,138 --> 01:47:06,970
Many times it is presented
to you in the wrong format.

1446
01:47:07,669 --> 01:47:12,163
It's identified as a murderer.
And you hate him.

1447
01:47:12,243 --> 01:47:13,730
What are you saying, papa?

1448
01:47:14,932 --> 01:47:17,530
I'm craving to see my
parents from so many years.

1449
01:47:17,922 --> 01:47:20,106
Do you remember your mother's face?

1450
01:47:21,987 --> 01:47:26,826
Yes, papa. How's she? Where's she?

1451
01:47:27,110 --> 01:47:30,506
- I failed to save her life even after selling you.
- Papa!

1452
01:47:31,979 --> 01:47:33,346
Control yourself, my child!

1453
01:47:34,058 --> 01:47:36,746
You've to resist many shocks today.

1454
01:47:49,706 --> 01:47:52,706
No! No, this is not possible.

1455
01:47:54,494 --> 01:47:58,773
O god! How you're testing me?

1456
01:48:00,976 --> 01:48:04,305
Don't be sad, my child.
I'm your father.

1457
01:48:05,053 --> 01:48:08,341
I'm ready to give my life
to keep your words.

1458
01:48:09,877 --> 01:48:12,746
A son met his father
after so many years. But how?

1459
01:48:14,537 --> 01:48:19,715
Papa! Papa, tell me that
you didn't kill Vijay's father.

1460
01:48:20,245 --> 01:48:22,779
Tell me that it's a lie. Mere lie.

1461
01:48:23,214 --> 01:48:29,095
Who will decide truth and lie?
Who will believe me?

1462
01:48:29,175 --> 01:48:33,223
But, papa! Vijay is my friend.
He can't lie to me.

1463
01:48:33,563 --> 01:48:36,963
And a father can lie to his son?

1464
01:48:37,243 --> 01:48:41,683
You don't know, papa.
Today I'm alive because of Vijay.

1465
01:48:44,403 --> 01:48:48,723
He has given me a new life.
I'm under his obligation.

1466
01:48:49,243 --> 01:48:53,203
Then pay off to this obligation.
Kill me and present me to him.

1467
01:48:53,283 --> 01:48:56,003
Enough, papa.
Don't say anything more.

1468
01:48:56,083 --> 01:48:57,603
Otherwise, I'll go mad.

1469
01:48:58,230 --> 01:49:01,563
My child, if possible,
bring your friend to me.

1470
01:49:01,897 --> 01:49:03,889
I will resolve all
his misunderstandings.

1471
01:49:05,201 --> 01:49:08,363
- Really? Papa!
- My child!

1472
01:49:10,575 --> 01:49:14,304
No! No, it's not possible, Ajay.
Tell me that you were joking.

1473
01:49:14,606 --> 01:49:16,699
A dirty joke,
that you'd never do again.

1474
01:49:16,779 --> 01:49:18,579
You're joking with me, Vijay..

1475
01:49:18,957 --> 01:49:21,499
You're telling me to refuse
to accept him as my father?

1476
01:49:22,399 --> 01:49:24,939
You know that I'm craving
for this happiness from childhood.

1477
01:49:25,019 --> 01:49:26,659
And you're telling me to forget it?

1478
01:49:26,739 --> 01:49:30,259
Ajay, once again I'm telling
you he can't be your father.

1479
01:49:30,672 --> 01:49:33,862
I can't fail to recognise
the face that's clear..

1480
01:49:34,457 --> 01:49:36,728
In my mind right
from my childhood.

1481
01:49:36,808 --> 01:49:39,619
- No, Ajay! That rascal is not your father.
- Vijay!

1482
01:49:41,614 --> 01:49:45,894
If it weren't you,
I'd have cut off his tongue.

1483
01:49:47,894 --> 01:49:51,734
Look, Vijay! Parent's relation
is always higher than the rest.

1484
01:49:52,503 --> 01:49:54,334
Please don't abuse it.

1485
01:49:55,254 --> 01:49:57,014
Why don't you believe me..

1486
01:49:57,094 --> 01:49:59,414
That my father
didn't kill your father.

1487
01:49:59,494 --> 01:50:01,798
I know that rascal very well.

1488
01:50:02,321 --> 01:50:07,609
And now I'm sure that
you're also his dirty blood.

1489
01:50:08,014 --> 01:50:14,308
You're still alive because
of his son. Don't forget.

1490
01:50:14,789 --> 01:50:15,789
Look at there.

1491
01:50:18,845 --> 01:50:24,933
Oh! So, you've brought
your father's swine, too?

1492
01:50:25,013 --> 01:50:29,654
No! He had saved my life once.

1493
01:50:31,262 --> 01:50:35,214
Today I'm pardoning his life.
Balance is clear.

1494
01:50:36,808 --> 01:50:41,947
Your balance, promises and words.

1495
01:50:42,777 --> 01:50:45,014
It says, do good and
cast it into the river.

1496
01:50:45,603 --> 01:50:48,334
I did good and caste
it to the drainage.

1497
01:50:48,414 --> 01:50:52,254
Enough, Vijay.
I can't listen to anything more.

1498
01:50:52,878 --> 01:50:54,320
I might not raise..

1499
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:56,733
A child inherits
traits of his father.

1500
01:50:57,251 --> 01:51:00,251
Kindness is always lost
upon an ungrateful man.

1501
01:51:00,331 --> 01:51:04,211
Stop it, Vijay. Even the
god couldn't keep patience..

1502
01:51:04,291 --> 01:51:07,771
After 100 abuses. Whereas
I'm an ordinary human being.

1503
01:51:07,851 --> 01:51:10,211
Not just human.
You're a black spot..

1504
01:51:10,291 --> 01:51:12,530
On the name of
friend and friendship.

1505
01:51:12,610 --> 01:51:14,411
Don't say anything more, Vijay.

1506
01:51:14,491 --> 01:51:18,731
If you want to stop me then
tell me that you're my friend..

1507
01:51:19,069 --> 01:51:22,491
- And not that rascal, bloody swine's son.
- Vijay!

1508
01:51:28,660 --> 01:51:36,660
"A friend has done worst
than an enemy."

1509
01:51:39,253 --> 01:51:47,253
"He has insulted the word friendship."

1510
01:51:54,692 --> 01:52:00,131
"This friendship of many years.."

1511
01:52:00,211 --> 01:52:05,593
"Why it has broken up in a moment?"

1512
01:52:05,673 --> 01:52:10,971
"Why it has broken up in a moment?"

1513
01:52:11,364 --> 01:52:15,592
"My friend.."

1514
01:52:15,672 --> 01:52:19,432
"My friend.."

1515
01:52:19,512 --> 01:52:24,850
"My friend, you turned your face.."

1516
01:52:24,930 --> 01:52:30,363
"It's like,
my god has turned face from me."

1517
01:52:30,542 --> 01:52:35,081
"It's like, my god
has turned face from me."

1518
01:52:35,161 --> 01:52:40,952
"This friendship of many years.."

1519
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:46,693
"Why it has broken up in a moment?"

1520
01:52:46,773 --> 01:52:51,912
"Why it has broken up in a moment?"

1521
01:53:08,230 --> 01:53:13,792
"I've shed my blood for you
in your difficult times."

1522
01:53:13,872 --> 01:53:19,212
"I've shed my blood for you
in your difficult times."

1523
01:53:19,292 --> 01:53:22,107
"How come your blood became so thin?"

1524
01:53:22,187 --> 01:53:25,072
"What is this day
I've come across today?"

1525
01:53:26,963 --> 01:53:29,992
"Your friendship.."

1526
01:53:32,531 --> 01:53:38,072
"Your friendship was my life.."

1527
01:53:38,382 --> 01:53:39,912
"Being close to me.."

1528
01:53:39,992 --> 01:53:44,352
"Today you've robbed
everything of mine."

1529
01:53:44,432 --> 01:53:48,956
"It's like, my god
has turned face from me."

1530
01:53:49,036 --> 01:53:54,872
"This friendship of many years.."

1531
01:53:55,141 --> 01:54:00,432
"Why it has broken up in a moment?"

1532
01:54:00,520 --> 01:54:05,501
"Why it has broken up in a moment?"

1533
01:54:24,284 --> 01:54:27,004
"Just like the lines created in water.."

1534
01:54:27,084 --> 01:54:29,694
"All the promises of friendship
have broken today."

1535
01:54:29,774 --> 01:54:32,616
"Just like the lines created in water.."

1536
01:54:32,718 --> 01:54:35,120
"All the promises of friendship
have broken today."

1537
01:54:35,200 --> 01:54:40,604
"My friend's friendship
was a weak wall."

1538
01:54:42,967 --> 01:54:45,604
"Why this happened with me?"

1539
01:54:48,412 --> 01:54:51,161
"Why this happened with me?"

1540
01:54:51,241 --> 01:54:53,971
"Whose curse affected us?"

1541
01:54:54,448 --> 01:54:57,044
"With this indifference of yours.."

1542
01:54:57,124 --> 01:55:00,041
"I feel I'm dead today."

1543
01:55:00,342 --> 01:55:04,764
"It's like, my god
has turned face from me."

1544
01:55:05,075 --> 01:55:10,804
"This friendship of many years.."

1545
01:55:11,172 --> 01:55:16,124
"Why it has broken up in a moment?"

1546
01:55:16,520 --> 01:55:21,478
"Why it has broken up in a moment?"

1547
01:55:21,939 --> 01:55:27,244
"My friend, you turned your face.."

1548
01:55:27,324 --> 01:55:32,644
"It's like, my god
has turned face from me."

1549
01:55:32,874 --> 01:55:38,484
"It's like, my god
has turned face from me."

1550
01:56:02,767 --> 01:56:03,807
Who's it?

1551
01:56:04,967 --> 01:56:09,807
A friend..
Whom you consider your enemy.

1552
01:56:10,967 --> 01:56:11,967
Friend?

1553
01:56:14,367 --> 01:56:16,127
I don't have any friend.

1554
01:56:17,340 --> 01:56:19,767
Now I don't have any friend.

1555
01:56:21,536 --> 01:56:24,767
Whether you consider
me a friend or enemy.

1556
01:56:25,786 --> 01:56:28,731
Never mind if you hate me..

1557
01:56:29,977 --> 01:56:37,647
Those who don't have a friend
also do not have an enemy.

1558
01:56:38,518 --> 01:56:43,216
- Vijay! Vijay, you need support.
- Support?

1559
01:56:44,816 --> 01:56:50,213
- Who will give support to me?
- I'm there.

1560
01:56:51,096 --> 01:56:55,216
Control yourself, Vijay.
When one door is closed..

1561
01:56:56,136 --> 01:56:58,696
God always opens
the other door for you.

1562
01:57:01,492 --> 01:57:03,256
- He opens?
- Yes.

1563
01:57:04,816 --> 01:57:06,136
Ok, let's go.

1564
01:57:07,091 --> 01:57:08,091
Vijay!

1565
01:57:12,656 --> 01:57:19,416
Ajay! You take so much care of me.

1566
01:57:20,936 --> 01:57:23,296
You do so much for me.

1567
01:57:26,576 --> 01:57:27,776
Your obligation..

1568
01:57:29,976 --> 01:57:33,776
How will I pay off to
this obligation of your, Ajay?

1569
01:57:35,576 --> 01:57:37,056
How?

1570
01:57:45,960 --> 01:57:48,301
A small support is enough
for the drowning person.

1571
01:57:49,607 --> 01:57:54,364
Vijay will never forget
your obligation in his life.

1572
01:57:56,056 --> 01:57:58,864
He was continuously
remembering your son Ajay.

1573
01:57:59,971 --> 01:58:03,673
It seems he's really hurt.

1574
01:58:04,604 --> 01:58:06,739
I hope you're also not hurt.

1575
01:58:07,899 --> 01:58:08,899
What?

1576
01:58:10,899 --> 01:58:12,819
You're showing
sympathy towards enemy.

1577
01:58:13,859 --> 01:58:16,099
Never show pity for
the enemy in your trap.

1578
01:58:16,933 --> 01:58:18,659
And the enemy, like Vijay?

1579
01:58:19,804 --> 01:58:22,419
Your enemy is still unconscious.

1580
01:58:23,395 --> 01:58:26,459
Tell me how I must behave with him?

1581
01:58:26,539 --> 01:58:29,739
Just like a friend behaves
with the other friend.

1582
01:58:30,632 --> 01:58:34,779
Assure him that he has
nobody in this life except you.

1583
01:58:38,181 --> 01:58:40,059
And what should I do
when he'll be assured..

1584
01:58:41,002 --> 01:58:43,699
That I've nobody
in life except him?

1585
01:58:45,092 --> 01:58:46,619
What should I do next?

1586
01:58:47,942 --> 01:58:49,779
We must reach to his mother.

1587
01:58:50,787 --> 01:58:54,019
Do something that he'll
completely forget himself..

1588
01:58:54,099 --> 01:58:57,539
In your company and
he'll take you to his mother.

1589
01:59:00,176 --> 01:59:06,484
I promise you. I'll definitely
reach to his mother one day.

1590
01:59:06,564 --> 01:59:09,222
That's like you, Kiran.
If you wish you can take him..

1591
01:59:09,440 --> 01:59:11,415
To our bungalow at Madh island.

1592
01:59:12,467 --> 01:59:14,692
There both of you will be alone.

1593
01:59:15,405 --> 01:59:19,095
And complete silence around will
help your work done easier. Ok?

1594
01:59:22,535 --> 01:59:23,575
Ok.

1595
01:59:25,991 --> 01:59:27,471
O god!

1596
01:59:29,431 --> 01:59:31,071
Ajay, get me a cup of tea.

1597
01:59:34,911 --> 01:59:35,911
Ajay!

1598
01:59:44,105 --> 01:59:45,209
Where am I?

1599
01:59:46,571 --> 01:59:47,951
Yesterday night I was on the road.

1600
01:59:49,791 --> 01:59:51,031
Whose house it must be?

1601
01:59:51,111 --> 01:59:52,911
It's not of your enemy.

1602
01:59:52,991 --> 01:59:54,831
Those who don't have a friend..

1603
01:59:55,991 --> 01:59:57,791
Also do not have an enemy.

1604
01:59:59,871 --> 02:00:01,951
- Tea!
- Don't say that, miss Kiran.

1605
02:00:03,071 --> 02:00:07,631
Only a friend can do so
much that you did for me at night.

1606
02:00:07,711 --> 02:00:10,231
Now that you've
called me your friend.

1607
02:00:10,831 --> 02:00:12,751
I hope you won't consider
me your enemy now.

1608
02:00:13,311 --> 02:00:16,951
- Miss Kiran..
- My name is Kiran.

1609
02:00:18,094 --> 02:00:21,151
Kiran, before you misunderstand..

1610
02:00:21,870 --> 02:00:23,831
Let me clear all
your misunderstanding.

1611
02:00:24,447 --> 02:00:26,111
Some things are such that..

1612
02:00:26,402 --> 02:00:29,782
More you try to go
away more it comes closer.

1613
02:00:30,374 --> 02:00:31,374
Kiran!

1614
02:00:32,311 --> 02:00:34,391
Kiran, the person
for whom you're working..

1615
02:00:35,471 --> 02:00:37,311
Is the biggest enemy of my life.

1616
02:00:38,268 --> 02:00:43,951
It's between you and him.
I was talking about you and me.

1617
02:00:44,230 --> 02:00:47,231
But, Kiran.. love with an enemy?

1618
02:00:47,311 --> 02:00:50,471
We left from home
to kill an enemy..

1619
02:00:51,337 --> 02:00:55,037
But when we came face to face,
we fell in love with him.

1620
02:00:56,332 --> 02:00:58,237
What if I ask the proof of your love?

1621
02:00:59,001 --> 02:01:01,317
I can offer my life for you.

1622
02:01:08,157 --> 02:01:09,797
I must reach to him first.

1623
02:01:10,478 --> 02:01:15,237
And you must come
with me to reach to him.

1624
02:01:15,392 --> 02:01:16,517
Where?

1625
02:01:17,474 --> 02:01:20,237
You must not ask questions in love.

1626
02:01:22,045 --> 02:01:24,761
Please come! Come in!

1627
02:01:29,037 --> 02:01:31,481
Kiran, you had promised
me to take you to PK?

1628
02:01:32,743 --> 02:01:33,921
Where have you..

1629
02:01:41,979 --> 02:01:45,193
I had told you..
Not to ask questions in love.

1630
02:01:45,273 --> 02:01:47,233
- But..
- Did you get the answer?

1631
02:01:49,513 --> 02:01:52,178
Kiran has gone with Vijay
to our bungalow at Madh island.

1632
02:01:52,258 --> 02:01:53,713
I've personally been there, PK.

1633
02:01:54,025 --> 02:01:55,233
But Kiran didn't reach there.

1634
02:01:55,356 --> 02:01:57,553
- Then where's she?
- Mack came to inform you the same.

1635
02:01:57,878 --> 02:01:59,257
But you became angry.

1636
02:01:59,890 --> 02:02:03,061
Tell me, Mack. But remember.

1637
02:02:03,600 --> 02:02:05,440
If your information proved wrong..

1638
02:02:05,720 --> 02:02:07,200
You know the result.

1639
02:02:07,280 --> 02:02:08,960
And what if it'll be true?

1640
02:02:09,906 --> 02:02:13,640
- Then I'll peel off her skin.
- Then come with me.

1641
02:02:14,280 --> 02:02:17,080
Then decide who's honest
and who's dishonest?

1642
02:02:17,920 --> 02:02:18,920
Let's go.

1643
02:02:27,360 --> 02:02:31,640
Papa, I've heard everything.
I'll do this work.

1644
02:02:31,720 --> 02:02:34,388
No, my child. I won't
let you do this dangerous work.

1645
02:02:34,760 --> 02:02:37,000
Papa, now your life
is very precious for me.

1646
02:02:37,600 --> 02:02:39,280
If anything will
happen to you then..

1647
02:02:39,890 --> 02:02:41,928
Nothing will happen to me.
And Tiger is with me.

1648
02:02:42,008 --> 02:02:44,100
- Who's Tiger?
- Tiger!

1649
02:02:54,059 --> 02:02:55,640
You don't know his strength.

1650
02:02:57,539 --> 02:03:02,237
I'm sorry to say papa, but
you're not aware of my strength.

1651
02:03:02,762 --> 02:03:04,200
And also not of Vijay.

1652
02:03:04,530 --> 02:03:07,200
We've tackled many
such Tigers till now.

1653
02:03:13,109 --> 02:03:14,120
Wonderful!

1654
02:03:15,259 --> 02:03:16,887
Do you realise now, papa?

1655
02:03:17,150 --> 02:03:20,207
PK, it's proved
that he's your blood.

1656
02:03:20,749 --> 02:03:23,767
But still, my child.
I won't let you go alone.

1657
02:03:30,261 --> 02:03:32,549
Kiran, I know you love me.

1658
02:03:33,556 --> 02:03:36,629
But you don't know
the outcome of this love.

1659
02:03:36,709 --> 02:03:37,709
Outcome?

1660
02:03:43,916 --> 02:03:51,916
"Who doesn't know
the outcome of love?"

1661
02:03:58,356 --> 02:04:03,476
"Who doesn't know
the outcome of love?"

1662
02:04:03,556 --> 02:04:08,076
"Who doesn't know
the outcome of love?"

1663
02:04:08,977 --> 02:04:13,596
"But, I'm helpless
at my crazy heart.."

1664
02:04:13,855 --> 02:04:18,076
"It doesn't listen to me."

1665
02:04:18,677 --> 02:04:22,236
"It doesn't listen to me."

1666
02:04:22,563 --> 02:04:27,516
"Who doesn't know
the outcome of love?"

1667
02:04:48,697 --> 02:04:53,233
"One, who fears of death
can never fall in love."

1668
02:04:53,541 --> 02:04:58,035
"Life is as good as death in love."

1669
02:04:58,321 --> 02:05:02,921
"Life is nothing compared to love."

1670
02:05:03,121 --> 02:05:08,161
"Even the death can't
overcome the love."

1671
02:05:10,253 --> 02:05:14,681
"If this wasn't true then.."

1672
02:05:15,041 --> 02:05:19,201
"If this wasn't true then.."

1673
02:05:19,681 --> 02:05:27,681
"Any lovers wouldn't have spent..
A madly life for his love."

1674
02:05:29,241 --> 02:05:33,761
"Heart doesn't listen to me."

1675
02:05:34,071 --> 02:05:39,001
"Who doesn't know
the outcome of love?"

1676
02:05:57,761 --> 02:06:02,201
"Whether she was Laila,
Shiri, Heer or Sohani."

1677
02:06:02,434 --> 02:06:07,281
"They are still
remembered after death."

1678
02:06:07,361 --> 02:06:11,801
"Who offered their life for love."

1679
02:06:11,881 --> 02:06:16,801
"Their fragrance is
still felt in the seasons."

1680
02:06:19,223 --> 02:06:23,662
"There's something.
Otherwise my heart.."

1681
02:06:23,951 --> 02:06:28,478
"There's something.
Otherwise my heart.."

1682
02:06:28,653 --> 02:06:33,742
"Wouldn't be so obstinate.."

1683
02:06:34,052 --> 02:06:37,961
"To offer my life for you."

1684
02:06:38,041 --> 02:06:42,419
"Heart doesn't listen to me."

1685
02:06:42,736 --> 02:06:47,401
"Who doesn't know
the outcome of love?"

1686
02:06:47,481 --> 02:06:52,161
"Who doesn't know
the outcome of love?"

1687
02:06:52,862 --> 02:06:57,381
"But, I'm helpless
at my crazy heart.."

1688
02:06:57,577 --> 02:07:02,001
"It doesn't listen to me."

1689
02:07:02,310 --> 02:07:06,681
"It doesn't listen to me."

1690
02:07:09,693 --> 02:07:13,493
Kiran, I used to believe that nobody
could impress me in this world.

1691
02:07:14,814 --> 02:07:16,534
But your love has really
impressed me today.

1692
02:07:17,933 --> 02:07:19,573
I just can't believe myself, Vijay.

1693
02:07:20,373 --> 02:07:24,093
When I met you for the first time,
I had seen a dream.

1694
02:07:25,453 --> 02:07:27,345
Let's go somewhere
very far from here.

1695
02:07:27,990 --> 02:07:32,413
So far.. where except you,
I and your mother..

1696
02:07:32,493 --> 02:07:35,213
Mother? How do you
know about my mother?

1697
02:07:35,634 --> 02:07:37,333
Vijay, I..

1698
02:07:37,413 --> 02:07:42,253
Is there any phone here?
Yes, but it's too far from here.

1699
02:07:42,333 --> 02:07:43,333
Vijay!

1700
02:07:48,893 --> 02:07:54,158
Vijay! Please don't go! I'm scared.

1701
02:07:54,373 --> 02:07:56,493
Don't worry. I'll just come. Ok?

1702
02:07:57,853 --> 02:08:02,013
- That's Kiran's car.
- That means Vijay also will be here.

1703
02:08:02,093 --> 02:08:03,933
- We'll go and shoot them now.
- No.

1704
02:08:04,749 --> 02:08:06,853
Nobody will take any
step without my order.

1705
02:08:18,555 --> 02:08:19,456
Listen.

1706
02:08:19,536 --> 02:08:21,613
You go and bring Kiran.
I'll take care of Vijay.

1707
02:08:21,693 --> 02:08:25,093
No, sir. If we'll leave you alone,
PK will shoot us.

1708
02:08:26,287 --> 02:08:28,527
Ok, you please come with me.
And, all of you bring Kiran.

1709
02:09:05,060 --> 02:09:07,404
Excuse me! I want to
make an urgent call to Bombay.

1710
02:09:07,484 --> 02:09:10,003
- Can I please?
- Yes, sure. - Thank you!

1711
02:09:10,208 --> 02:09:11,820
How much time it
takes to get the line?

1712
02:09:11,900 --> 02:09:14,204
If the line is clear
it won't even take 2 minutes.

1713
02:09:14,940 --> 02:09:17,860
- Will you have some tea?
- Can I have something cold?

1714
02:09:17,940 --> 02:09:19,180
Yes, sure. I'll bring it now.

1715
02:09:19,260 --> 02:09:23,644
Hello! Trunk booking!
I'm calling from 43431.

1716
02:09:24,111 --> 02:09:25,460
I want to make a call to Bombay.

1717
02:09:29,620 --> 02:09:31,220
I want to listen
to the conversation..

1718
02:09:31,300 --> 02:09:33,180
Of the person
calling from outside.

1719
02:09:33,797 --> 02:09:36,740
- Yes! Bombay!
- You can listen to it from here.

1720
02:09:39,095 --> 02:09:42,377
Yes, Bombay number is 212133.

1721
02:09:46,221 --> 02:09:47,951
Shanti, Vijay here.

1722
02:09:48,031 --> 02:09:51,951
Mr. Vijay, where are you?
Madam is not well.

1723
02:09:52,031 --> 02:09:52,831
What happened to her?

1724
02:09:52,911 --> 02:09:54,671
- She's getting the attacks.
- Look, Shanti.

1725
02:09:54,751 --> 02:09:56,607
This is not the first time
that she's getting attacks.

1726
02:09:56,631 --> 02:09:59,031
You know which injection
can give her relief.

1727
02:09:59,111 --> 02:10:01,391
Injections are not in
stock from last two days.

1728
02:10:01,471 --> 02:10:02,631
Injections out of stock?

1729
02:10:04,191 --> 02:10:05,711
Look, Shanti,
I can't reach there soon.

1730
02:10:05,791 --> 02:10:06,927
You please go and
get the injections.

1731
02:10:06,951 --> 02:10:09,551
But how can I leave
madam in this condition?

1732
02:10:09,631 --> 02:10:11,575
I don't know anything.
You please hurry up.

1733
02:10:11,655 --> 02:10:13,669
Go and get the injections. Ok!

1734
02:10:32,489 --> 02:10:33,511
Shanti!

1735
02:10:41,355 --> 02:10:42,391
Shanti!

1736
02:10:46,238 --> 02:10:47,330
Where's she?

1737
02:10:50,107 --> 02:10:52,351
Where's this Shanti? Shan..

1738
02:11:30,067 --> 02:11:31,147
Send them in!

1739
02:11:33,666 --> 02:11:36,430
- Commissioner..
- I'm sorry.. I'm sorry, Vijay.

1740
02:11:36,510 --> 02:11:38,918
- Police is trying it's best to find her.
- What?

1741
02:11:39,672 --> 02:11:41,746
But how did you come
to know that Kiran is missing?

1742
02:11:42,085 --> 02:11:44,011
- Kiran?
- Yes, Kiran. My friend.

1743
02:11:44,290 --> 02:11:46,050
Who took me to her
house to save my life.

1744
02:11:46,810 --> 02:11:48,849
Who's she from whom
she wants to save you?

1745
02:11:49,452 --> 02:11:50,452
PK!

1746
02:11:51,850 --> 02:11:52,693
PK?

1747
02:11:52,773 --> 02:11:53,773
Yes, PK.

1748
02:11:54,370 --> 02:11:55,410
This is his photo.

1749
02:11:57,770 --> 02:11:59,130
What's your enmity with him?

1750
02:12:00,410 --> 02:12:03,930
Commissioner!
This man has murdered my father.

1751
02:12:05,370 --> 02:12:08,084
- Your father?
- He's right, Commissioner.

1752
02:12:08,970 --> 02:12:10,610
My child,
once again I'm telling you..

1753
02:12:10,690 --> 02:12:12,450
Please come to my
house with your mother.

1754
02:12:12,530 --> 02:12:14,394
Otherwise her life
will also be at risk.

1755
02:12:14,474 --> 02:12:17,090
You didn't do this right
by hiding all this from police.

1756
02:12:17,838 --> 02:12:21,569
Anyway, you please
call up on 212133 first.

1757
02:12:22,528 --> 02:12:24,970
How did you come
to know this number?

1758
02:12:25,528 --> 02:12:26,690
Is my mother alright?

1759
02:12:27,753 --> 02:12:32,028
Your mother is missing.
Nurse had come to report here.

1760
02:12:34,588 --> 02:12:36,730
Vijay! Vijay! Listen to me..

1761
02:12:38,850 --> 02:12:41,490
Excuse me!
How far is Hasratganj from here?

1762
02:12:41,570 --> 02:12:42,730
- Hasratganj?
- Yes.

1763
02:12:44,490 --> 02:12:46,210
Why are you looking
at me like this?

1764
02:12:47,130 --> 02:12:48,730
It seems you're new in Lucknow.

1765
02:12:48,810 --> 02:12:51,130
Sister, this is Mumbai
and not Lucknow.

1766
02:12:51,210 --> 02:12:52,970
- Mumbai? - Yes.
- How can this be Mumbai?

1767
02:12:53,050 --> 02:12:54,970
- What's the matter?
- I don't know why she's..

1768
02:12:55,050 --> 02:12:57,048
Calling Mumbai, Lucknow?

1769
02:12:57,128 --> 02:13:00,250
- Sister, this is Mumbai.
- No, this is Lucknow.

1770
02:13:00,786 --> 02:13:02,173
It seems she's mad.

1771
02:13:09,610 --> 02:13:10,650
You rascal!

1772
02:13:12,146 --> 02:13:14,810
Where's my mother?
Where's your murderer father?

1773
02:13:15,590 --> 02:13:18,250
Where's his secret place?
Tell me about his accomplices.

1774
02:13:18,470 --> 02:13:19,770
Why don't you say anything?

1775
02:13:22,333 --> 02:13:24,170
Did you come across
my father's accomplices?

1776
02:13:24,355 --> 02:13:25,770
And did you see my power?

1777
02:13:25,850 --> 02:13:29,004
Coward! You're using
your manpower to control me?

1778
02:13:29,084 --> 02:13:30,930
If you're so brave
then release me once..

1779
02:13:31,010 --> 02:13:32,810
And then see my strength.

1780
02:13:36,926 --> 02:13:39,017
- Sir, police!
- You please go.

1781
02:13:50,341 --> 02:13:51,847
Vijay! Vijay!

1782
02:13:51,927 --> 02:13:56,407
Vijay, what happened?
Who beat you? Who were they?

1783
02:13:57,132 --> 02:13:58,807
- Inspector!
- Yes, sir.

1784
02:13:59,860 --> 02:14:00,967
Take care of him.

1785
02:14:06,308 --> 02:14:07,447
Mumbai!

1786
02:14:08,155 --> 02:14:10,967
How come I reached to Mumbai?

1787
02:14:11,850 --> 02:14:15,727
Vijay! Vijay! Vijay!

1788
02:14:21,176 --> 02:14:22,918
Sir, let's take
her to the hospital.

1789
02:14:22,998 --> 02:14:26,847
No! It'll be a police case
if we take her to the hospital.

1790
02:14:27,441 --> 02:14:29,813
Take her home.
We'll call the doctor at home.

1791
02:14:30,027 --> 02:14:31,027
Hurry up!

1792
02:14:31,301 --> 02:14:32,469
Shanti! Shant..

1793
02:14:42,669 --> 02:14:47,669
Mummy! Mummy! Mummy!

1794
02:14:48,789 --> 02:14:49,949
Where are you, mummy?

1795
02:14:50,838 --> 02:14:54,069
Where will I find you now...? Mummy!

1796
02:14:55,709 --> 02:14:59,549
Have patience, Vijay!
Police will find your mother soon.

1797
02:15:02,881 --> 02:15:04,922
And what if it'll fail?

1798
02:15:05,811 --> 02:15:07,174
It's impossible.

1799
02:15:09,286 --> 02:15:12,541
Impossible!
Impossible! If this is impossible..

1800
02:15:13,202 --> 02:15:15,789
Then why police failed
to arrest PK till now?

1801
02:15:16,633 --> 02:15:19,092
Do you have the answer to this?

1802
02:15:20,276 --> 02:15:24,064
Tell me that.. he'll definitely
be arrested one day.

1803
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:26,413
But what will happen..

1804
02:15:26,493 --> 02:15:29,848
If something will
happen with my mother today?

1805
02:15:30,688 --> 02:15:32,534
What will happen then,
commissioner?

1806
02:15:33,344 --> 02:15:37,523
Will police..
Be able to bring my mother back?

1807
02:15:38,474 --> 02:15:40,435
Will you be able to
give my mother back to me?

1808
02:15:40,952 --> 02:15:42,835
Will you be able to
give my mother back to me?

1809
02:15:43,909 --> 02:15:45,031
No, commissioner!

1810
02:15:45,329 --> 02:15:48,009
You and your police
can't help me by any means.

1811
02:15:48,089 --> 02:15:50,249
Go away from here for god's sake.
Leave me alone.

1812
02:15:53,329 --> 02:15:58,529
PK took away my mother. My mother
is with him. I'm sure about it.

1813
02:15:59,009 --> 02:16:00,289
Ok, fine. I'm going..

1814
02:16:00,907 --> 02:16:02,769
But let me tell you
something before going.

1815
02:16:03,729 --> 02:16:06,809
How can you doubt PK
for kidnapping your mother?

1816
02:16:06,889 --> 02:16:08,489
I'm sure about it, commissioner.

1817
02:16:08,885 --> 02:16:10,805
If it's not true then
his son wouldn't be found..

1818
02:16:10,849 --> 02:16:12,626
At the gate of this building.

1819
02:16:13,409 --> 02:16:14,505
Who's his son?

1820
02:16:15,854 --> 02:16:17,115
Who's his son?

1821
02:16:17,709 --> 02:16:23,822
Now I'll never take that
rascal's name again. Never!

1822
02:16:24,288 --> 02:16:27,868
Ajay! PK's son?

1823
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:47,000
Mummy?!

1824
02:16:59,155 --> 02:17:02,529
Doctor! What's the matter?
Is everything fine?

1825
02:17:03,405 --> 02:17:06,649
Actually, Mr. Ajay made
an accident and was disturbed.

1826
02:17:07,022 --> 02:17:10,459
Accident? My son is so emotional?

1827
02:17:28,352 --> 02:17:29,499
What's the matter, my child?

1828
02:17:29,580 --> 02:17:32,240
- A woman came in front of my car.
- Woman?

1829
02:17:32,320 --> 02:17:33,445
Yes..

1830
02:17:34,654 --> 02:17:36,920
Doctor said she's very serious.

1831
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:40,347
- I'm so disturbed.
- No need to be disturbed in this.

1832
02:17:40,924 --> 02:17:43,527
Many people die with
accident in big cities.

1833
02:17:44,326 --> 02:17:46,566
Consult the doctor
and arrange for a nurse.

1834
02:17:47,632 --> 02:17:49,087
We've many other things to do.

1835
02:17:49,166 --> 02:17:50,166
What's that?

1836
02:17:51,246 --> 02:17:53,246
Search the entire city.

1837
02:17:54,287 --> 02:17:56,207
We must find Vijay's mother.

1838
02:17:57,262 --> 02:17:59,007
I'll tackle Kiran!

1839
02:17:59,647 --> 02:18:02,447
- Asha! Asha, come soon.
- Yes, brother.

1840
02:18:02,727 --> 02:18:05,167
Asha! That day Ajay's
father had come here, right?

1841
02:18:05,246 --> 02:18:09,286
- Yes.
- Look at these pictures and tell me who was he?

1842
02:18:09,791 --> 02:18:13,329
- He! - Are you sure?
- Yes. - Very good.

1843
02:18:21,566 --> 02:18:25,726
He's that murderer..
He had killed my husband.

1844
02:18:27,288 --> 02:18:30,727
You're one from his group. Tell
me who brought me here. Tell me.

1845
02:18:31,008 --> 02:18:32,008
Where's my Vijay?

1846
02:18:32,343 --> 02:18:35,098
I'll kill you. You please
tell me where's my Vijay?

1847
02:18:35,179 --> 02:18:36,451
Where's my Vijay?

1848
02:18:54,154 --> 02:18:55,411
Is she the same?

1849
02:18:59,415 --> 02:19:01,971
Well done, my child! Great!

1850
02:19:03,848 --> 02:19:06,131
But how did you come to
know that she's Vijay's mother?

1851
02:19:06,998 --> 02:19:09,571
When she came in sense
she started screaming..

1852
02:19:09,651 --> 02:19:11,696
With the sight of
your photo and was saying..

1853
02:19:11,776 --> 02:19:13,931
- That you're a murderer. And I..
- Did you kill her?

1854
02:19:15,495 --> 02:19:18,701
No! I wanted to kill her.

1855
02:19:20,044 --> 02:19:23,671
But for now I've given
her sleeping tablet.

1856
02:19:29,406 --> 02:19:32,072
Papa, I kept my promise.

1857
02:19:32,152 --> 02:19:34,123
Now you please keep your promise.

1858
02:19:34,571 --> 02:19:37,131
Tell me how can we live
with respect in the society?

1859
02:19:37,210 --> 02:19:39,410
Come! Come and see it yourself.

1860
02:19:39,929 --> 02:19:43,331
Leave me! I said leave!
Leave! I said leave! Leave me..

1861
02:19:45,102 --> 02:19:48,091
Leave her.
Asha has come to meet me.

1862
02:19:48,762 --> 02:19:53,364
No, Ajay. This girl has
no place in your life now.

1863
02:19:53,570 --> 02:19:54,570
What do you mean?

1864
02:19:56,082 --> 02:20:01,482
You must give this sacrifice for
the new life you want to live. Papa!

1865
02:20:01,962 --> 02:20:04,682
Ajay, this man is a fraud,
cheat, criminal and impostor.

1866
02:20:04,762 --> 02:20:08,936
Girl! You haven't
seen my anger yet.

1867
02:20:09,122 --> 02:20:11,642
My brother has told
me everything about you.

1868
02:20:12,082 --> 02:20:14,927
At least you should have
kept your son away from all this.

1869
02:20:15,248 --> 02:20:17,115
Shut up, Asha! Stop your nonsense.

1870
02:20:17,802 --> 02:20:20,162
I don't want to see your
face who can dare to insult..

1871
02:20:20,242 --> 02:20:22,090
My father in my presence.

1872
02:20:22,170 --> 02:20:23,762
Brother is coming here with police.

1873
02:20:23,842 --> 02:20:25,281
Let's run away from here.

1874
02:20:25,361 --> 02:20:27,081
Otherwise you'll repent
in your entire life.

1875
02:20:27,122 --> 02:20:29,242
Unfortunate people
come and go off..

1876
02:20:29,322 --> 02:20:32,362
From this world while crying.

1877
02:20:33,638 --> 02:20:36,562
Take her inside and locks her.
And keep watch on her.

1878
02:20:36,882 --> 02:20:37,962
Let's go, papa!

1879
02:20:38,402 --> 02:20:42,442
Ajay! I never knew you
could go down to this level.

1880
02:22:15,182 --> 02:22:16,477
Which is this place, papa?

1881
02:22:17,142 --> 02:22:19,850
Wait for some time.
You'll come to know everything.

1882
02:22:20,798 --> 02:22:21,971
I'll just come.

1883
02:22:50,534 --> 02:22:52,463
Vijay, your mother's
life is in danger.

1884
02:22:52,562 --> 02:22:54,370
- How do you know that?
- What all I know..

1885
02:22:54,450 --> 02:22:55,986
I'll tell this to you later.

1886
02:22:56,066 --> 02:22:58,636
- But, you..
- Don't worry about me.

1887
02:22:58,716 --> 02:23:01,094
Your mother's life is at risk. C'mon!

1888
02:23:02,524 --> 02:23:03,786
Come on!

1889
02:23:25,045 --> 02:23:27,810
Sir Ghanshyam Das?

1890
02:23:27,890 --> 02:23:30,848
Yes, my child,
another form of your father.

1891
02:23:31,962 --> 02:23:33,130
I had told you..

1892
02:23:33,680 --> 02:23:35,800
The day I'll find Vijay's mother..

1893
02:23:36,177 --> 02:23:40,010
Police will never
be able to reach to PK.

1894
02:23:40,698 --> 02:23:44,250
Because today,
PK and his entire life will..

1895
02:23:44,730 --> 02:23:47,090
Completely vanish
with this old woman.

1896
02:23:48,050 --> 02:23:50,570
And only Sir Ghanshyam
Das will remain alive.

1897
02:23:51,370 --> 02:23:53,119
Who's a respectable
person of the society..

1898
02:23:53,199 --> 02:23:54,770
Who gives charity.

1899
02:23:55,090 --> 02:23:57,490
And world salutes him.

1900
02:23:57,689 --> 02:23:59,690
Also accept my salutation, uncle.

1901
02:24:00,153 --> 02:24:03,730
- Vijay, my child. My child!
- Mummy!

1902
02:24:04,442 --> 02:24:06,290
Mummy, what happened to you?

1903
02:24:06,370 --> 02:24:08,210
I'm fine.
You please don't worry about me.

1904
02:24:09,279 --> 02:24:12,061
He's.. that murderer.
He killed your father.

1905
02:24:12,141 --> 02:24:13,454
Don't worry, mummy.

1906
02:24:14,890 --> 02:24:16,138
So, uncle!

1907
02:24:17,299 --> 02:24:20,289
You always used to complain
that I never come here.

1908
02:24:21,267 --> 02:24:23,373
Today I've kept my promise.

1909
02:24:24,425 --> 02:24:28,018
Today mummy and I, both are here.

1910
02:24:28,718 --> 02:24:31,258
But I'm sorry to say
that after some time..

1911
02:24:31,797 --> 02:24:33,418
You won't exist in this world.

1912
02:24:35,387 --> 02:24:39,578
Uncle! I used to play with
these toys in my childhood.

1913
02:24:40,442 --> 02:24:41,682
Now I've become young.

1914
02:24:42,642 --> 02:24:45,802
Now these hands need your throat.

1915
02:24:46,322 --> 02:24:49,922
How will you reach
to him when I'm here?

1916
02:24:50,722 --> 02:24:53,962
Tell your mother to pray for you.

1917
02:24:54,275 --> 02:24:58,522
You, disloyal,
she's the mother of a brave man.

1918
02:24:59,193 --> 02:25:02,002
I'm a lioness's son. Mind it.

1919
02:25:02,822 --> 02:25:06,482
No, Sherry! He's my hunt.

1920
02:25:07,934 --> 02:25:12,562
I've promised him that
if I'm a brave mother's son..

1921
02:25:13,349 --> 02:25:17,322
I'll fight with him
alone and fulfil his wish.

1922
02:26:34,274 --> 02:26:36,712
Once again, I'm telling you, Vijay.

1923
02:26:37,465 --> 02:26:39,361
Did you see my strength?

1924
02:26:39,992 --> 02:26:41,872
And I'm giving you one more chance.

1925
02:26:43,032 --> 02:26:45,712
Then don't complain
that you were slipped.

1926
02:26:46,560 --> 02:26:49,712
And you had to defeat. Take this.

1927
02:26:51,552 --> 02:26:52,792
Ajay!

1928
02:26:54,232 --> 02:26:59,192
Winner is always decided
in the last game.

1929
02:27:06,632 --> 02:27:09,432
Sit quietly.
Or else I'll shoot you.

1930
02:27:19,672 --> 02:27:22,312
I can defeat in 14
rounds of each game, Ajay.

1931
02:27:22,752 --> 02:27:23,992
But in the 15th one.

1932
02:27:29,353 --> 02:27:34,552
So! This is the 15th
and last round, right?

1933
02:27:38,621 --> 02:27:42,536
I had told you that
I'd win the last game.

1934
02:27:43,140 --> 02:27:45,976
I've come to enemy's house
with complete preparation.

1935
02:27:46,770 --> 02:27:49,930
Sir! Tell your men
to throw away the gun.

1936
02:27:50,010 --> 02:27:51,410
Otherwise you'll lose your son.

1937
02:27:51,490 --> 02:27:53,810
Sherry! Throw it away. Throw!

1938
02:27:55,130 --> 02:28:00,250
Vijay! Don't shoot my son.
Let's join hands.

1939
02:28:00,348 --> 02:28:03,690
No need of it, sir.
Only one bullet.

1940
02:28:04,370 --> 02:28:07,890
I'll hit one bullet to you
and your son's life will be saved.

1941
02:28:09,450 --> 02:28:10,450
P.K.

1942
02:28:33,650 --> 02:28:34,570
Vijay!

1943
02:28:34,650 --> 02:28:36,690
Vijay! My child! My child!

1944
02:28:36,925 --> 02:28:40,490
Ajay! Ajay! What did you do this?

1945
02:28:40,850 --> 02:28:44,457
If you wouldn't released
the enemy once..

1946
02:28:44,756 --> 02:28:47,570
Who has released him, papa?

1947
02:28:49,330 --> 02:28:51,450
Who left him?

1948
02:28:52,170 --> 02:28:58,210
I thought if I miss the target
he'll shoot at me.

1949
02:28:58,631 --> 02:29:03,170
Liar! Disloyal! You told me that
you're under Vijay's obligation.

1950
02:29:03,760 --> 02:29:05,050
That I'm his friend.

1951
02:29:05,888 --> 02:29:09,050
Our own blood matters
more than everything.

1952
02:29:09,908 --> 02:29:13,210
Would I have offered
my father for his mother?

1953
02:29:14,114 --> 02:29:16,530
But you said, you're not his son.

1954
02:29:16,610 --> 02:29:19,770
If I'd not said so,
you'd not have stopped screaming.

1955
02:29:20,386 --> 02:29:21,770
Papa would have killed you..

1956
02:29:21,850 --> 02:29:23,610
And Vijay wouldn't
have come in my trap.

1957
02:29:24,270 --> 02:29:27,650
Sherry, go and demolish
the den with dynamite.

1958
02:29:27,730 --> 02:29:29,930
Papa's illegal life should
be completely washed out..

1959
02:29:30,010 --> 02:29:32,377
Before police reaches.
Is that clear? Get it!

1960
02:29:32,457 --> 02:29:34,040
Yes, Sherry! C'mon, do it fast.

1961
02:29:37,181 --> 02:29:40,610
- And I'll kill you, sir!
- Vijay! My child, Vijay. Vijay!

1962
02:29:41,051 --> 02:29:42,890
He's alive, my son.

1963
02:29:43,936 --> 02:29:47,770
Who son? And whose son?

1964
02:29:48,758 --> 02:29:52,010
It says needy stoops
to everything however mean.

1965
02:29:52,822 --> 02:29:55,050
And I did the same.

1966
02:29:55,364 --> 02:29:59,530
And now you'll meet
death like an animal.

1967
02:30:00,300 --> 02:30:03,770
Such a big fraud?
I'll peel off your skin.

1968
02:30:05,103 --> 02:30:08,330
Animals skin can be peeled
off and not of humans PK.

1969
02:30:08,746 --> 02:30:10,890
Which can be useful
to others after death.

1970
02:30:11,861 --> 02:30:13,821
Your skin won't
be used for anything.

1971
02:30:17,621 --> 02:30:19,581
Where are you going?

1972
02:30:19,901 --> 02:30:23,981
I still have to explain you
how you got trapped in my plot.

1973
02:30:24,784 --> 02:30:27,061
Vijay! That day when
I was standing down..

1974
02:30:27,141 --> 02:30:28,901
At Kiran's house..

1975
02:30:32,009 --> 02:30:33,397
Yes. Then what happened?

1976
02:30:33,477 --> 02:30:36,620
It was our good luck that
he locked me in the same room..

1977
02:30:36,700 --> 02:30:40,941
Which he had built
in memory of his son.

1978
02:30:41,661 --> 02:30:44,417
Mack, this is a special room of PK.

1979
02:30:44,825 --> 02:30:47,101
He has built it
in memory of his son.

1980
02:30:47,765 --> 02:30:50,325
What? PK's son is dead?

1981
02:30:51,477 --> 02:30:55,845
He might be alive but
you'd be definitely killed.

1982
02:30:56,729 --> 02:30:59,485
He had sold off his
son in his childhood.

1983
02:31:01,125 --> 02:31:03,285
- And these statues?
- It's the symbol of him.

1984
02:31:04,365 --> 02:31:07,245
He also has the
same statue's pendant.

1985
02:31:07,645 --> 02:31:10,805
And PK is madly searching
for it till today.

1986
02:31:11,525 --> 02:31:13,125
But I don't understand how come..

1987
02:31:13,365 --> 02:31:15,445
Kiran told you
to lock this man here?

1988
02:31:15,525 --> 02:31:18,125
And I decided at the same moment..

1989
02:31:18,205 --> 02:31:21,325
That I'll be your lost son.

1990
02:31:23,965 --> 02:31:28,285
To reach to the enemy
I made my friend, my enemy.

1991
02:31:28,725 --> 02:31:30,605
What if something would
have happened to you?

1992
02:31:30,965 --> 02:31:32,965
This life was under
your obligation, my friend.

1993
02:31:33,685 --> 02:31:36,165
So what if it'd
have offered for you?

1994
02:31:37,365 --> 02:31:40,445
I've hurt you a lot Vijay.
Please, forgive me.

1995
02:31:40,644 --> 02:31:41,725
Shall I?

1996
02:31:43,285 --> 02:31:44,485
Ok, I've forgiven you.

1997
02:31:44,565 --> 02:31:46,885
Really? Thank you!

1998
02:31:48,447 --> 02:31:50,005
- You're welcome!
- Stop!

1999
02:31:51,205 --> 02:31:57,005
Mr. Ajay! After cheating PK,
you got cheated here.

2000
02:31:57,316 --> 02:31:58,845
Did you forget your lover?

2001
02:31:59,278 --> 02:32:01,685
I've been loyal to
PK from so many years.

2002
02:32:02,076 --> 02:32:05,125
If you wish her life
then hand over PK to me.

2003
02:32:05,205 --> 02:32:07,805
No, Ajay,
don't leave him even if I die.

2004
02:32:07,885 --> 02:32:09,085
- Sherry!
- Ajay!

2005
02:32:10,382 --> 02:32:14,205
- Ok, Sherry! You leave Asha. We'll leave PK.
- Ok

2006
02:32:25,785 --> 02:32:28,725
PK! Sherry?

2007
02:32:29,507 --> 02:32:30,965
That's a good boy!

2008
02:32:34,767 --> 02:32:37,167
I'm also loyal to you, PK.

2009
02:32:38,847 --> 02:32:41,327
The son whom you're searching for..

2010
02:32:41,607 --> 02:32:46,127
Since so many years.
At least meet him once.

2011
02:32:47,407 --> 02:32:48,767
This is the locket.

2012
02:32:49,887 --> 02:32:52,807
In memory of which
you've made an entire room.

2013
02:32:55,607 --> 02:32:56,927
And this is the photo that..

2014
02:32:58,007 --> 02:33:00,807
Nobody can have except your son.

2015
02:33:01,887 --> 02:33:03,487
Now you might ask me..

2016
02:33:03,567 --> 02:33:07,127
Why did I keep it secret
even thought I knew everything.

2017
02:33:08,053 --> 02:33:10,887
Because I wanted
this son to be alive..

2018
02:33:10,967 --> 02:33:14,224
At the time of performing
last rituals of his father.

2019
02:33:15,113 --> 02:33:17,638
So that your soul might get rest.

2020
02:33:17,990 --> 02:33:19,927
And the time has come now, PK.

2021
02:33:20,945 --> 02:33:22,677
Do you remember Hari Singh?

2022
02:33:23,646 --> 02:33:26,967
Whom you had thrown
to the hungry tigers?

2023
02:33:27,394 --> 02:33:30,647
Yes, I'm his only one daughter.

2024
02:33:32,446 --> 02:33:37,126
And today.. I'm throwing
you to these two tigers.

2025
02:33:37,206 --> 02:33:41,486
C'mon, PK. Sherry! C'mon!

2026
02:33:43,606 --> 02:33:45,606
Take your revenge.

2027
02:33:48,086 --> 02:33:52,286
Mummy, take this revolver.
And shoot him.

2028
02:33:52,686 --> 02:33:55,166
Take your revenge.
I'll tackle the Law. C'mon.

2029
02:33:59,166 --> 02:34:02,046
You rascal! I'll kill you..

2030
02:34:06,120 --> 02:34:11,126
It's my job to kill people
and not the newcomers like you.

2031
02:34:12,246 --> 02:34:15,006
If anybody will move from here,
I'll kill this woman.

2032
02:34:15,655 --> 02:34:16,855
C'mon, Sherry!

2033
02:34:26,655 --> 02:34:27,868
Mummy!

2034
02:34:49,267 --> 02:34:51,365
- Mummy!
- Vijay, my child!

2035
02:34:52,092 --> 02:34:55,726
- Mummy! - Vijay, my child! Child!
- Mummy!

2036
02:34:56,508 --> 02:34:59,101
So, sir! Didn't I tell you that..

2037
02:34:59,764 --> 02:35:02,821
Who will take care
of you if we won't be there?

2038
02:35:04,356 --> 02:35:06,941
And Vijay, we've got
detailed information about..

2039
02:35:07,021 --> 02:35:09,221
You and your friend, Ajay.

2040
02:35:10,795 --> 02:35:12,261
You're Dinanath's son, right?

2041
02:35:12,942 --> 02:35:16,541
Yes, commissioner sir,
but how come you..

2042
02:35:16,621 --> 02:35:20,101
You've increased our job
by hiding everything from before.

2043
02:35:20,508 --> 02:35:21,695
I must say, Commissioner.

2044
02:35:21,775 --> 02:35:24,781
If you had not come on time
I'd have lost my mother.

2045
02:35:24,861 --> 02:35:27,021
Anyway, everything
happens for better.

2046
02:35:27,413 --> 02:35:29,248
But I didn't understand something.

2047
02:35:30,246 --> 02:35:33,369
When did you come to know
that Ajay is not PK's son..

2048
02:35:33,449 --> 02:35:34,648
But your friend?

2049
02:35:34,728 --> 02:35:36,808
Commissioner,
it happened in presence of PK..

2050
02:35:37,187 --> 02:35:38,968
When I came here
and mummy hugged me..

2051
02:35:39,048 --> 02:35:41,048
She softly told me that
Ajay is just doing a drama.

2052
02:35:41,103 --> 02:35:43,268
Don't misunderstand him.

2053
02:35:44,304 --> 02:35:45,648
If that was the case, Ajay.

2054
02:35:45,728 --> 02:35:47,735
Then why didn't you tell
this to Vijay from before?

2055
02:35:47,815 --> 02:35:49,768
Ah! I was helpless, commissioner.

2056
02:35:49,988 --> 02:35:54,448
His accomplices used
to be around me all the time.

2057
02:35:54,528 --> 02:35:55,848
I see..

2058
02:35:56,463 --> 02:35:59,688
Did you hear this, PK?
You used to underestimate them.

2059
02:35:59,768 --> 02:36:01,608
But they are proved
to be smarter than you.

2060
02:36:02,727 --> 02:36:05,047
Take him away. And listen!

2061
02:36:05,727 --> 02:36:07,567
Both of you come
to my house tonight.

2062
02:36:07,647 --> 02:36:09,407
I've to talk to you
something very important.

2063
02:36:14,287 --> 02:36:18,287
- Let's go.
- Won't you hug your father for the last time?

2064
02:36:18,367 --> 02:36:22,880
No, he's not my father.
He's my father.

2065
02:36:23,505 --> 02:36:27,463
Father, at least now you tell me
how did you get those three queens?

2066
02:36:31,756 --> 02:36:33,927
Just how you had got three jacks.

2067
02:36:34,403 --> 02:36:36,087
That's where I made mistake.

2068
02:36:36,681 --> 02:36:38,527
If I'd have made three aces..

2069
02:36:38,607 --> 02:36:40,967
How would you have
made three aces, my dear?

2070
02:36:41,398 --> 02:36:45,844
Those three aces were with me.

2071
02:36:46,157 --> 02:36:48,550
- What?
- Yes. I'm carrying it from that day onwards..

2072
02:36:48,630 --> 02:36:50,047
To show it to you.

2073
02:36:53,328 --> 02:36:55,447
Now, this is the limit.

2074
02:36:57,586 --> 02:36:59,653
Oh, sorry! Sorry!

2075
02:37:04,022 --> 02:37:08,473
"At God, there's delay but not denial."

2076
02:37:08,553 --> 02:37:10,794
"At God, there's delay but not denial."
