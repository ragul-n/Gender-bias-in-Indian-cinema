1
00:00:57,838 --> 00:01:01,774
When this is a great
symbol of country's unity..

2
00:01:02,342 --> 00:01:06,301
..hails the motherland..

3
00:01:06,847 --> 00:01:12,649
..then every world
bows to its glory and pride.

4
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,518
Every Indian knows and accepts..

5
00:01:16,723 --> 00:01:18,350
..that he wants non-violence..

6
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:24,295
..but to protect the honor
of the nation, he can give life..

7
00:01:24,564 --> 00:01:26,327
..and take life too.

8
00:01:27,401 --> 00:01:30,529
Ashok Chakra (Gallantry Award) is..

9
00:01:30,604 --> 00:01:33,573
..a tribute to martyrs of 26-11..

10
00:01:34,274 --> 00:01:38,870
..who foiled the plans of terrorists..

11
00:01:39,713 --> 00:01:41,203
..and destroyed it.

12
00:01:43,984 --> 00:01:48,921
We swearthat no harm
will come to this independence.

13
00:01:49,656 --> 00:01:54,286
We swearthat no harm
will come to this independence.

14
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:58,620
We won't let the
martyr's sacrifice be defamed.

15
00:01:58,965 --> 00:02:03,163
As long as their is blood in the body..

16
00:02:03,503 --> 00:02:07,940
..we won't let
anyone sell the motherland.

17
00:02:08,842 --> 00:02:12,278
Hail India!

18
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,172
Hail India!

19
00:02:16,249 --> 00:02:19,946
Hail Goddess!

20
00:02:20,187 --> 00:02:23,714
Hail Motherland!

21
00:02:41,908 --> 00:02:45,344
Hail Motherland! Hail Motherland!

22
00:02:45,679 --> 00:02:49,445
Hail Motherland! Hail Motherland!

23
00:02:49,716 --> 00:02:53,812
Hail Motherland! Hail Motherland!

24
00:02:53,887 --> 00:02:57,948
Hail Motherland! Hail Motherland!

25
00:02:58,191 --> 00:03:01,524
Hail Motherland! Hail Motherland!

26
00:03:01,761 --> 00:03:05,197
Hail Motherland! Hail Motherland!

27
00:03:30,891 --> 00:03:32,483
It seems a ship is in the front.

28
00:03:32,559 --> 00:03:36,552
Stop it here! Stop right now!

29
00:04:02,155 --> 00:04:03,452
We saw the destination.

30
00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:02,375
Stop the ship, atheist!

31
00:05:03,383 --> 00:05:04,407
Stop it!

32
00:05:22,869 --> 00:05:23,893
Come on..

33
00:05:26,606 --> 00:05:28,836
Tell me the way to Mumbai.

34
00:05:30,243 --> 00:05:31,267
Tell me.

35
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:37,908
yes, kids.

36
00:05:38,151 --> 00:05:40,779
Greetings, uncle. -Where did you reach?

37
00:05:40,854 --> 00:05:43,482
We've won the first front!

38
00:05:43,757 --> 00:05:45,588
What to do with the owner of this boat?

39
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:49,353
He has been used. Send him to hell!

40
00:05:54,234 --> 00:05:55,258
Hey..

41
00:06:23,863 --> 00:06:26,889
Father, we'll remember
this needless photo-session.

42
00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:28,361
Take mom's photograph.

43
00:06:28,435 --> 00:06:30,835
I'm getting late
for my coaching classes.

44
00:06:30,904 --> 00:06:32,166
Bye.

45
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,900
Bye, dad. Bye, mom. -Bye.

46
00:06:39,612 --> 00:06:40,909
Sudha!

47
00:06:42,682 --> 00:06:47,312
I didn't realize when
my daughter grew up so big.

48
00:06:48,655 --> 00:06:50,179
Look at the way time flies!

49
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:54,292
I wish I could cage
these fleeting moments.

50
00:06:54,661 --> 00:06:56,595
Stop your philosophy now!

51
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:01,458
yourfire breathing gun
is betterthan yourwords.

52
00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:05,467
If I could do this with planning..

53
00:07:05,538 --> 00:07:09,406
..then my Sudha would've
said.. -Oh no! I've no time.

54
00:07:09,476 --> 00:07:12,377
I've work in the
bathroom, etcetera, etcetera.

55
00:07:12,712 --> 00:07:14,577
you're right.

56
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,477
Greetings, uncle.

57
00:07:21,755 --> 00:07:23,552
Greetings, son.

58
00:07:24,157 --> 00:07:26,887
How much journey have you
covered of Jehadi (war) mission?

59
00:07:27,827 --> 00:07:30,352
We've captured the boat of atheist.

60
00:07:30,797 --> 00:07:32,196
God willing..

61
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,328
..in a few hours
destination will be near.

62
00:07:36,536 --> 00:07:38,504
God is with you!

63
00:07:38,772 --> 00:07:40,637
He'll always help you.

64
00:07:41,341 --> 00:07:42,365
Amen!

65
00:07:42,609 --> 00:07:45,544
Determination is
the foundation of victory.

66
00:07:45,612 --> 00:07:48,604
To survive in present
times, you've to spread terror!

67
00:07:48,815 --> 00:07:49,941
Of course.

68
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:53,342
When you step in Mumbai..

69
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,784
..I'll talk to you again.

70
00:07:56,289 --> 00:07:57,722
As you order, uncle.

71
00:07:57,957 --> 00:08:01,222
Listen, always be alert on this mission.

72
00:08:01,461 --> 00:08:04,726
Our mission is Jehad. Goodbye.

73
00:08:05,732 --> 00:08:07,324
Goodbye.

74
00:08:18,244 --> 00:08:19,268
yes.

75
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,204
yes, sir?

76
00:08:21,915 --> 00:08:23,473
yes, sir. I've read the file.

77
00:08:24,184 --> 00:08:25,412
I'll sign and send it back.

78
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:28,151
yes, sir. Don't worry.

79
00:08:28,721 --> 00:08:29,745
Bye, sir.

80
00:08:31,424 --> 00:08:33,187
They think system is their slave.

81
00:08:36,462 --> 00:08:37,486
yes, sir?

82
00:08:38,531 --> 00:08:39,759
Tambe, what is the matter?

83
00:08:40,133 --> 00:08:42,601
It seems you've brought new problem.

84
00:08:42,802 --> 00:08:45,464
Sir, that.. the minister's son..

85
00:08:45,538 --> 00:08:49,201
The one whose car
killed 3 people and injured 2.

86
00:08:50,476 --> 00:08:51,500
Tambe..

87
00:08:52,478 --> 00:08:55,675
..don't help petty
crimes or it will become..

88
00:08:55,748 --> 00:08:58,239
..so big that it will devour you.

89
00:08:59,752 --> 00:09:01,151
Law is same for everyone.

90
00:09:01,788 --> 00:09:03,847
Inform the media and lock up. Listen.

91
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:07,589
Tell everyone I want
no arguments. you can go.

92
00:09:08,361 --> 00:09:09,385
Ok, sir.

93
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:39,482
Hello.

94
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,884
yes, it's me.

95
00:09:43,396 --> 00:09:44,556
I said it. So?

96
00:09:46,165 --> 00:09:47,894
Now listen to me.

97
00:09:48,568 --> 00:09:50,729
I'll do what my conscience decides. Ok?

98
00:09:51,371 --> 00:09:52,668
Do you want to say anything?

99
00:09:53,139 --> 00:09:54,299
you don't understand?

100
00:09:55,275 --> 00:09:57,607
I'll always be with the truth.

101
00:09:58,511 --> 00:10:00,570
No. I'll do exactly the way..

102
00:10:00,847 --> 00:10:02,405
..my conscious tells me. Ok?

103
00:10:05,652 --> 00:10:08,280
yes. I'll listen to my inner voice.

104
00:10:08,688 --> 00:10:11,680
I'll be with the truth.. only the truth.

105
00:10:11,758 --> 00:10:14,488
Ok? And I think
you won't phone me again.

106
00:10:14,761 --> 00:10:16,319
you'll not call me back again!

107
00:10:16,696 --> 00:10:17,890
Thank you.

108
00:10:49,862 --> 00:10:52,262
Sir, buy fresh fish.

109
00:10:52,332 --> 00:10:54,493
Sir, buy fresh fish.

110
00:10:54,567 --> 00:10:56,228
Buy fresh fish.

111
00:10:56,302 --> 00:10:58,293
you won't get it anywhere else.

112
00:10:58,371 --> 00:11:03,468
you won't get it
anywhere else. Buy fresh fish.

113
00:11:03,643 --> 00:11:07,374
Fish is good for
your skin and health, sir.

114
00:11:07,447 --> 00:11:09,938
Even yourwife will be
happy to see such fresh fish.

115
00:11:10,216 --> 00:11:11,308
Where is Taj?

116
00:11:11,384 --> 00:11:15,150
Sir, we sell fish even to Taj hotel.

117
00:11:16,422 --> 00:11:17,446
And CST.

118
00:11:17,523 --> 00:11:20,549
Sir, you'll get
very expensive fish in CST.

119
00:11:20,626 --> 00:11:21,957
I'll sell for cheap.

120
00:11:22,428 --> 00:11:24,953
I'll tell you the way to CST and Taj.

121
00:11:26,933 --> 00:11:29,458
Oh, 500? I don't have change.

122
00:11:29,869 --> 00:11:30,893
Keep it.

123
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,164
Sir, fish?

124
00:11:33,306 --> 00:11:34,330
Keep them too.

125
00:11:35,341 --> 00:11:37,468
Oh.. what a man!

126
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:42,711
Sir, CST is to the
left and Taj is to the right.

127
00:11:45,818 --> 00:11:48,412
''My Lord Pandhari..''

128
00:11:48,488 --> 00:11:49,682
Mother. -yes?

129
00:11:49,756 --> 00:11:52,316
Why are you picking it up?
I'm here to do it. Give it to me.

130
00:11:52,658 --> 00:11:55,718
Look, it's made up of
glass. It might shatter.

131
00:11:55,795 --> 00:11:58,525
If your back hurts while
lifting it, it will be a big problem.

132
00:11:59,465 --> 00:12:02,628
Son. These hands are still very strong.

133
00:12:02,702 --> 00:12:05,262
Until I don't see you daughter married..

134
00:12:05,471 --> 00:12:09,737
..I won't die. I still have
to play with my grandchildren.

135
00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:10,935
Got it?

136
00:12:11,177 --> 00:12:14,544
Oh.. go on day dreaming.

137
00:12:14,614 --> 00:12:17,139
There is no tax on it. -you naughty..

138
00:12:17,216 --> 00:12:18,376
Mother..

139
00:12:19,285 --> 00:12:22,345
Once Rashmi gets
married, I'll be relieved.

140
00:12:22,422 --> 00:12:23,446
yes, son.

141
00:12:23,856 --> 00:12:26,324
Mother, do you like
the appearance of this house?

142
00:12:26,626 --> 00:12:29,356
I've adorned it forthe guests.

143
00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:33,559
The groom's family aren't
coming to see the house, but Rashmi.

144
00:12:33,633 --> 00:12:34,657
Where is Rashmi?

145
00:12:35,201 --> 00:12:38,728
Rashmi.. hey, Rashmi.

146
00:12:39,338 --> 00:12:41,397
Rashmi! I'll find her.

147
00:12:41,474 --> 00:12:43,772
Papa! -Ghost!

148
00:12:44,544 --> 00:12:45,636
She's not a ghost.

149
00:12:45,711 --> 00:12:48,578
Is she a witch!
-Papa, do I look like a witch?

150
00:12:48,648 --> 00:12:49,979
Save me, mother.. -Don't..

151
00:12:50,216 --> 00:12:53,310
Mother, save me from this witch!

152
00:12:53,553 --> 00:12:56,613
Father, why did you call me a witch?

153
00:12:56,689 --> 00:12:58,418
Do you look like a witch?

154
00:12:58,491 --> 00:13:01,324
I'll hit you. -you
don't look, but you really are.

155
00:13:01,394 --> 00:13:04,227
Don't ruin my shirt.
I've to go on duty. -Father.

156
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,190
O' God!

157
00:13:09,168 --> 00:13:11,796
I never complained to you.

158
00:13:13,306 --> 00:13:15,831
Whether I got joy or sorrow..

159
00:13:16,742 --> 00:13:18,642
..I accepted it with a smile.

160
00:13:19,545 --> 00:13:21,308
Rashmi is getting married, God!

161
00:13:21,848 --> 00:13:24,510
There shouldn't be a
problem in herwedding.

162
00:13:26,252 --> 00:13:29,585
Let there always be
peace and joy in this house.

163
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,657
If I've ever erred..

164
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:38,263
..please forgive me, God.

165
00:13:39,365 --> 00:13:41,356
Forgive me, God.

166
00:13:42,368 --> 00:13:46,304
Forgive me.

167
00:13:50,643 --> 00:13:51,667
Mother..

168
00:14:08,294 --> 00:14:09,318
Wipe yourtears.

169
00:14:11,831 --> 00:14:12,923
This time..

170
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:15,701
..isn't for crying.

171
00:14:21,507 --> 00:14:23,441
Just pray to God..

172
00:14:25,545 --> 00:14:27,240
..that whateverwe're doing..

173
00:14:28,314 --> 00:14:29,576
..should end up well.

174
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,774
And..

175
00:14:32,518 --> 00:14:34,247
..whateverwe'll do..

176
00:14:35,621 --> 00:14:37,248
..will be biggerthan our capacity.

177
00:14:37,657 --> 00:14:39,750
May God answer your prayers.

178
00:14:41,594 --> 00:14:44,563
Son, guests are coming this evening.

179
00:14:45,298 --> 00:14:47,357
Return home before they come.

180
00:14:48,167 --> 00:14:50,692
Or else, guests might come..

181
00:14:51,204 --> 00:14:53,604
..and as usual I
should be left waiting for you.

182
00:14:54,807 --> 00:14:57,605
Come home soon. -Mother.

183
00:14:58,778 --> 00:15:02,179
I'm a policeman. I might get late.

184
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:04,473
And..

185
00:15:05,484 --> 00:15:09,853
you know very well that
today is an important day of my life.

186
00:15:11,624 --> 00:15:12,648
Look, mother..

187
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:19,659
..today.. before the guests come home..

188
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,358
..I'll be home.

189
00:15:23,936 --> 00:15:25,198
My son..

190
00:15:25,871 --> 00:15:27,930
Don't try to fool us.

191
00:15:29,408 --> 00:15:31,137
Stop it!

192
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:33,201
you always say this.

193
00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:35,939
If you don't come home on
time, watch the consequence.

194
00:15:36,582 --> 00:15:39,517
Rashmi and I won't talk to you. -Really?

195
00:15:41,754 --> 00:15:44,518
But today is the most
important day of my life.

196
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:48,783
I promise.. before the
guests arrive, I'll be home.

197
00:15:50,196 --> 00:15:52,323
Where is my cap?

198
00:15:52,598 --> 00:15:53,860
I'll get it. -Just a minute.

199
00:15:54,634 --> 00:15:55,862
It's in my pocket.

200
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:00,195
Mother, bye. -Ok. -Bye.

201
00:16:05,511 --> 00:16:06,535
Greetings, father.

202
00:16:06,746 --> 00:16:08,441
Son Mukesh, you're home.

203
00:16:08,914 --> 00:16:10,905
yes, father. How are you now?

204
00:16:11,183 --> 00:16:12,207
I'm fine.

205
00:16:12,852 --> 00:16:15,116
Father, I've brought medicines for you.

206
00:16:15,388 --> 00:16:19,222
One who has son like
you, don't need medicines.

207
00:16:19,825 --> 00:16:23,488
Did you hear,
mother? He's a sweet talker.

208
00:16:23,929 --> 00:16:25,590
He's trying to evade taking medicines.

209
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,559
Rachna, give medicines.

210
00:16:29,935 --> 00:16:33,871
I'll give you medicines myself. Here.

211
00:16:41,347 --> 00:16:42,371
Thank you.

212
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:47,780
Mother, how is your leg pain now?

213
00:16:47,853 --> 00:16:49,480
I've met the doctor.

214
00:16:49,689 --> 00:16:52,157
He has prescribed new
medicines. I'll get it soon.

215
00:16:52,224 --> 00:16:54,215
Listen, you too take them on time.

216
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,620
Be happy, son! May
God give you long life.

217
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:01,630
Dad, don't you get bored
of eating pudding every day?

218
00:17:02,401 --> 00:17:05,370
Don't you get bored of
going to disco every day?

219
00:17:06,605 --> 00:17:07,629
Have fried bread!

220
00:17:07,807 --> 00:17:10,901
Oily fried bread! Now ways, dad.

221
00:17:12,712 --> 00:17:15,237
Our daughter is dieting.

222
00:17:16,515 --> 00:17:18,483
Give her grass if you've made some.

223
00:17:21,287 --> 00:17:22,311
you're late.

224
00:17:22,888 --> 00:17:26,221
No, dad.
Discipline. I've learnt from you.

225
00:17:26,292 --> 00:17:27,316
you're before time.

226
00:17:30,162 --> 00:17:32,926
Dad. Do you rememberwhat I said?

227
00:17:33,566 --> 00:17:34,590
What?

228
00:17:35,434 --> 00:17:38,801
Dad, I got admission. Visa form is here.

229
00:17:39,338 --> 00:17:41,704
you just have to sign. Simple.

230
00:17:42,942 --> 00:17:44,375
So what have you decided?

231
00:17:44,877 --> 00:17:46,640
I don't want to think, dad.

232
00:17:46,712 --> 00:17:49,738
you've to think. you've 3 options.

233
00:17:49,815 --> 00:17:52,306
Australia, US or UK.

234
00:17:52,385 --> 00:17:53,943
And my choice is US.

235
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,552
I'm a government servant.

236
00:18:02,895 --> 00:18:04,385
I get meager salary.

237
00:18:06,298 --> 00:18:07,322
Do you know that?

238
00:18:08,234 --> 00:18:09,701
you've 3 options.

239
00:18:10,236 --> 00:18:13,637
Mumbai, Kanpur and Bengaluru. Choose it.

240
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,566
Dad. you choose it.

241
00:18:17,643 --> 00:18:19,304
you've 3 options.

242
00:18:19,378 --> 00:18:24,645
Either sign happily
or in anger or just sign.

243
00:18:35,127 --> 00:18:37,595
Greetings, uncle. -Greetings.

244
00:18:37,663 --> 00:18:40,154
Congratulations on
stepping on the land..

245
00:18:40,232 --> 00:18:42,325
..of Mumbai to achieve your mission.

246
00:18:42,935 --> 00:18:44,630
Congratulations to you too, uncle.

247
00:18:45,171 --> 00:18:46,832
How is the environment there?

248
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:52,836
There is peace all around.

249
00:18:52,912 --> 00:18:55,380
Change peace into restlessness.

250
00:18:55,448 --> 00:18:58,679
So that you should
realize we still exist.

251
00:18:58,751 --> 00:19:00,742
your orderwill be obeyed, uncle.

252
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:06,156
Shed blood on the land
of atheists. Spread terror!

253
00:19:06,392 --> 00:19:08,087
As you say, uncle.

254
00:19:08,327 --> 00:19:10,227
Form groups of two.

255
00:19:10,429 --> 00:19:13,489
Target big buildings and hotels.

256
00:19:13,566 --> 00:19:16,626
Hold people hostage so
that we can make demands.

257
00:19:16,702 --> 00:19:18,897
Uncle, your orderwill be obeyed.

258
00:19:19,138 --> 00:19:20,730
May God be with you!

259
00:19:20,806 --> 00:19:23,775
I've handed you under God's shelter.

260
00:19:24,376 --> 00:19:26,606
Goodbye. -Goodbye.

261
00:19:34,386 --> 00:19:36,377
We had cordoned Lalbaug area.

262
00:19:36,922 --> 00:19:38,753
And Joshi came. -Who is Joshi?

263
00:19:39,225 --> 00:19:41,523
The one who was exiled from Lalbaug.

264
00:19:41,594 --> 00:19:44,358
That dark goon. -yes. What happened?

265
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:47,524
What? We were
moving towards the car. -yes.

266
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,568
And he took out his
dagger. -What are you saying?

267
00:19:49,635 --> 00:19:53,332
yes. I slapped him hard.
He left everything and fled.

268
00:19:53,405 --> 00:19:55,236
Really? Then what?

269
00:19:55,307 --> 00:19:58,538
What? Ourteam followed. Just a minute.

270
00:19:58,944 --> 00:20:00,138
Just a minute.

271
00:20:02,848 --> 00:20:04,543
Hello. -Hello.

272
00:20:04,717 --> 00:20:07,880
Listen.. -yes? -you didn't come yet.

273
00:20:08,454 --> 00:20:10,581
Salvi and sister have come.

274
00:20:12,258 --> 00:20:14,852
Salvi and sister are there?

275
00:20:14,927 --> 00:20:17,691
yes. They came long ago. Where are you?

276
00:20:17,763 --> 00:20:19,822
I'm on duty at CST.

277
00:20:19,899 --> 00:20:21,833
I know what you're doing in CST.

278
00:20:21,901 --> 00:20:24,961
I'm doing my duty, I'm not having fun.

279
00:20:25,204 --> 00:20:27,229
I told you bring vegetables and sweets.

280
00:20:27,306 --> 00:20:28,637
But I had to do everything.

281
00:20:28,941 --> 00:20:32,741
Listen. Take care of Salvi and sister.

282
00:20:32,811 --> 00:20:33,903
I'll be there.

283
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,680
I know how to take
care. When will you come?

284
00:20:36,749 --> 00:20:40,207
I'm coming right away. Ok?

285
00:20:40,486 --> 00:20:42,511
He can't be trusted.

286
00:20:42,588 --> 00:20:44,249
Ekta, is he late?

287
00:20:44,723 --> 00:20:46,588
No.. yes.

288
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,695
He's on the way. He's a bit late, right?

289
00:20:50,763 --> 00:20:53,630
Don't worry, Ekta.
Policemen are like that only.

290
00:20:53,899 --> 00:20:55,890
Thank God for Mumbai police..

291
00:20:55,968 --> 00:20:57,936
..they're alert to every danger.

292
00:20:58,003 --> 00:21:01,404
yes. That's why
Mumbai police is so famous.

293
00:21:01,674 --> 00:21:04,871
Dear, at least forget all
this today and start eating.

294
00:21:04,944 --> 00:21:06,309
Please. -yes.

295
00:21:06,612 --> 00:21:08,409
Food is very tasty, sister-in-law.

296
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,209
Do serve it to Shinde.

297
00:21:11,483 --> 00:21:14,646
I'll serve him only
when he comes home on time.

298
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,415
Don't worry, sister-in-law.

299
00:21:16,589 --> 00:21:18,284
We'll dine with him some othertime.

300
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,789
Everything is amiss.

301
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,858
Sages and saints..

302
00:21:24,396 --> 00:21:26,193
..all are moving towards crime.

303
00:21:26,432 --> 00:21:27,797
I don't understand..

304
00:21:28,267 --> 00:21:30,735
..why is there so
much filth for preaching..

305
00:21:30,803 --> 00:21:32,361
..and spreading religion.

306
00:21:33,772 --> 00:21:36,570
Such big names are
there.. if you hearthem..

307
00:21:37,643 --> 00:21:38,837
..you'll be 'Shunned'.

308
00:21:38,911 --> 00:21:41,903
Oh! you mean to say I'll be stunned.

309
00:21:42,615 --> 00:21:44,378
No need to tell me.

310
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:46,884
It's your duty to give time to work..

311
00:21:46,952 --> 00:21:48,920
..and to yourfamily as well.

312
00:21:49,388 --> 00:21:50,878
Did I err again?

313
00:21:50,956 --> 00:21:53,390
Do you remember you've an 11 years old..

314
00:21:53,459 --> 00:21:55,620
..daughterwho is in boarding school?

315
00:21:55,694 --> 00:21:57,594
Of course, I remember. -Of course.

316
00:21:57,963 --> 00:21:59,692
Did you read her mail? -Mail?

317
00:22:00,265 --> 00:22:02,358
I'll read it. No big deal!

318
00:22:02,434 --> 00:22:05,460
I know you must've
forgotten me as usual, but don't worry..

319
00:22:05,738 --> 00:22:07,865
..mom is there to remind you.

320
00:22:08,607 --> 00:22:13,476
Papa, I prayed to God to
make you famous world wide.

321
00:22:14,413 --> 00:22:17,940
Hey, dad! you'll come
to take me this time. Ok?

322
00:22:18,917 --> 00:22:22,353
yeah! I'll come to take you.

323
00:22:23,589 --> 00:22:24,613
I love you, child.

324
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,890
Wow, brother! It's great.

325
00:22:31,163 --> 00:22:35,497
I neverthought I'd eat food in Mumbai!

326
00:22:36,402 --> 00:22:37,926
And incinerate it!

327
00:22:39,438 --> 00:22:40,837
Did you hearthat proverb?

328
00:22:41,774 --> 00:22:45,301
your angels are like yourthoughts.

329
00:22:48,714 --> 00:22:51,842
This isn't a city of
angels, but of atheists.

330
00:22:59,491 --> 00:23:00,890
Greetings, uncle.

331
00:23:01,293 --> 00:23:02,760
Greetings, kids.

332
00:23:03,228 --> 00:23:06,254
Where did you reach?
-We're eating food in restaurant.

333
00:23:06,465 --> 00:23:10,458
Eat stomach full.
This will last till 6 hours.

334
00:23:11,203 --> 00:23:15,162
Physical hunger means
nothing in front of hunger of Jehad.

335
00:23:16,175 --> 00:23:18,871
Amen! -Achieve such a feat..

336
00:23:18,944 --> 00:23:20,878
..which should be memorable.

337
00:23:20,946 --> 00:23:22,140
God willing!

338
00:23:22,815 --> 00:23:26,808
We'll try our best to
wipe the atheists, uncle.

339
00:23:27,219 --> 00:23:28,243
Don't worry.

340
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,381
May God make your
journey of Jehad easy. -Amen!

341
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:34,221
Hello. -Hello.

342
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,859
yes? Tell me.

343
00:23:36,562 --> 00:23:37,688
What? -Come soon.

344
00:23:37,896 --> 00:23:41,457
Soon? Ok, I'm coming. -you
keep saying it, but you don't come.

345
00:23:41,533 --> 00:23:43,262
Dear, I said I'm coming.

346
00:23:43,335 --> 00:23:45,769
Hurry! you've to sign
papers. -What's the rush!

347
00:23:45,838 --> 00:23:49,239
Which paper has to be
signed today? -Don't you know.

348
00:23:49,508 --> 00:23:50,941
Documents of Insurance.

349
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:53,970
Ok. I'm coming.

350
00:23:56,315 --> 00:23:58,510
Shinde, you got stuck again today.

351
00:23:58,984 --> 00:24:01,578
It seems yourwife will scold you today.

352
00:24:01,653 --> 00:24:03,848
She was doing that.

353
00:24:03,922 --> 00:24:05,583
What are you saying? -yes.

354
00:24:05,824 --> 00:24:07,553
Rane, how is your son?

355
00:24:07,626 --> 00:24:09,526
Friend, that's why I came to you.

356
00:24:09,595 --> 00:24:11,495
Doctor said to perform operation.

357
00:24:11,563 --> 00:24:14,532
It will cost a lot. Can you help me?

358
00:24:15,801 --> 00:24:17,894
I'll try to do
something. -It'll be a big favor.

359
00:24:18,137 --> 00:24:20,697
Don't worry everything

you can get it any
time from my wife. -Ok, sir.

370
00:24:54,339 --> 00:24:55,829
Stop. Stop.

371
00:25:01,747 --> 00:25:04,238
Will you take us to VT? -yes, sir. Come.

372
00:25:14,259 --> 00:25:15,692
He looks like a Muslim.

373
00:25:16,295 --> 00:25:18,923
It seems you're from abroad?

374
00:25:19,164 --> 00:25:20,426
yes. So?

375
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:26,499
Nothing. you should've
gone to shrine of Haji Ali first.

376
00:25:26,805 --> 00:25:28,773
He's the biggest sage of all.

377
00:25:34,613 --> 00:25:36,774
Can I ask something?

378
00:25:36,849 --> 00:25:40,216
yes. -What's your name?

379
00:25:40,886 --> 00:25:45,687
Asab. Mohammed Akmal Kamil Asab.

380
00:25:45,757 --> 00:25:47,918
It's a very big name.

381
00:25:49,194 --> 00:25:50,923
Intentions are big too.

382
00:25:51,797 --> 00:25:53,924
Do you pray? -No, sir.

383
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,861
I spend all the time driving cab.

384
00:25:57,502 --> 00:26:00,835
In the struggle for life,
I'm driving cab for 20 years.

385
00:26:02,407 --> 00:26:04,398
Do you know who a Muslim is?

386
00:26:04,476 --> 00:26:10,381
One who is firm on his faith
and wishes welfare of everyone.

387
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:15,581
It's every Muslim's
duty to protect Islam..

388
00:26:16,922 --> 00:26:19,914
..even if he has to kill atheists.

389
00:26:20,626 --> 00:26:24,426
But sir, Islam is a religion of peace.

390
00:26:24,796 --> 00:26:27,287
There is no place for violence in it.

391
00:26:27,866 --> 00:26:30,699
Even God has said in holy Koran..

392
00:26:30,769 --> 00:26:32,828
..you follow your
religion and let them follow theirs.

393
00:26:33,572 --> 00:26:37,201
you follow your religion
and let them follow theirs.

394
00:26:37,743 --> 00:26:40,405
If you don't protect Islam today..

395
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:42,806
..then yourfuture generations..

396
00:26:43,215 --> 00:26:46,810
..will forget Islam and
embrace some other religion.

397
00:26:49,321 --> 00:26:50,447
What will you do then?

398
00:26:50,522 --> 00:26:53,514
But sir, God is
one. He's in every thing.

399
00:26:53,592 --> 00:26:56,152
Pull over! Our journey ends here.

400
00:26:56,228 --> 00:26:59,220
But sir, you had to go
to CST. This is Vile Parle.

401
00:26:59,298 --> 00:27:00,458
Bye.

402
00:27:00,666 --> 00:27:01,690
Take yourfare.

403
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:28,719
Can I ask something?

404
00:27:30,495 --> 00:27:31,519
yes.

405
00:27:33,332 --> 00:27:34,629
We've only one daughter.

406
00:27:37,336 --> 00:27:38,360
I know.

407
00:27:39,404 --> 00:27:41,838
So why don't you sign her Visa form?

408
00:27:42,507 --> 00:27:44,737
She wants to go to US to study..

409
00:27:45,277 --> 00:27:46,437
..not to tourthe world.

410
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:51,206
I would've signed
for herworld tour. -What?

411
00:27:52,584 --> 00:27:54,381
I gave her 3 options, Sudha.

412
00:27:55,253 --> 00:27:56,277
Do you remember?

413
00:27:57,322 --> 00:28:00,155
Kanpur, Mumbai or Bengaluru.

414
00:28:00,726 --> 00:28:02,887
Did you ask herwhat she wanted?

415
00:28:06,264 --> 00:28:07,595
What kind of a mother are you?

416
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,158
Are you her step mother?

417
00:28:10,802 --> 00:28:13,794
Ah? Do you think I don't love her?

418
00:28:14,806 --> 00:28:17,274
you want to send my
darling daughter away from me?

419
00:28:18,343 --> 00:28:19,742
you're saying this?

420
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:22,339
yes.

421
00:28:23,915 --> 00:28:26,645
If she studies in
India, I can meet her any time.

422
00:28:26,718 --> 00:28:29,414
I'll be stuck trying to
get visa for London or America.

423
00:28:29,855 --> 00:28:31,447
No.. I can't do that.

424
00:28:43,468 --> 00:28:44,833
What are you making?

425
00:28:45,237 --> 00:28:47,637
I told you to make
mountain norfountain. Listen.

426
00:28:47,939 --> 00:28:50,305
Mountain is made like this.

427
00:28:52,411 --> 00:28:55,346
And what's behind
fountain.. I mean mountain.

428
00:28:55,414 --> 00:28:58,906
What? -There is a sun
behind mountain. Do you know?

429
00:28:59,251 --> 00:29:00,411
Sun!

430
00:29:00,485 --> 00:29:03,352
Oh! How did this world turn upside down?

431
00:29:03,422 --> 00:29:05,720
Why? -you're
teaching your son how to draw?

432
00:29:05,791 --> 00:29:07,782
you don't know
yourself and you're teaching him.

433
00:29:07,859 --> 00:29:10,384
Thank you very much.

434
00:29:10,729 --> 00:29:13,664
Oh my God, dad! Is that you?

435
00:29:14,266 --> 00:29:16,393
I can't believe this. -Just a minute.

436
00:29:19,271 --> 00:29:21,432
you faked my signature on college forms.

437
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:27,603
It won't do in visa form.

438
00:29:29,114 --> 00:29:30,911
Accept that you did it.

439
00:29:31,683 --> 00:29:35,278
This is called
forgery. I can arrest you for it.

440
00:29:36,688 --> 00:29:38,451
I can arrest you right now.

441
00:29:40,725 --> 00:29:43,660
This won't do. Stand up.

442
00:29:49,534 --> 00:29:50,728
Now do sit-ups.

443
00:29:52,804 --> 00:29:54,396
Enough.

444
00:29:54,773 --> 00:29:55,933
Sit.

445
00:30:13,358 --> 00:30:15,326
Thank you, dad. I love you.

Taxi driver got killed in that blast.

449
00:30:26,705 --> 00:30:28,605
We don't know how this blast took place.

450
00:30:28,673 --> 00:30:30,197
Sudha. Turn on the TV.

451
00:30:33,645 --> 00:30:36,546
This is the biggest terrorist strike!

452
00:30:36,615 --> 00:30:40,676

-Had this blast taken in airport..

469

471
00:31:34,673 --> 00:31:37,233

Nothing could be said
about those responsible..

486
00:32:18,383 --> 00:32:20,647
We just got news

00:35:04,115 --> 00:35:06,913
Don't show mercy on atheists, kids.

521

The terrorist who is
caught alive is a Pakistani.

529
00:36:23,394 --> 00:36:26,192
Pakistan's school of
terrorists have been exposed..

530
00:36:26,264 --> 00:36:30,166
..who are uprooting
humanity with violence.

531
00:36:30,235 --> 00:36:33,796
Pakistan had sent a
terror group to spread..

532
00:36:33,872 --> 00:36:37,603
..carnage and now
the world is aware of it.

533
00:36:37,675 --> 00:36:39,870

534
00:36:39,944 --> 00:36:42,139
..it this time as we've evidence.

535
00:36:42,213 --> 00:36:46,479
The brave martyrwho faced
the bullet is Tularam Antule.

536
00:36:47,218 --> 00:36:48,879
No, mother!

537
00:36:49,254 --> 00:36:52,951
Mother.. he can't leave me!

538
00:36:54,492 --> 00:36:56,426
Mother! No!

539
00:36:57,395 --> 00:37:00,489
No! -He can't leave me!

540
00:37:00,565 --> 00:37:04,797
Mother.. mother!

541
00:37:09,908 --> 00:37:17,474
Mother! Mother! -Father! Father!

542
00:37:17,549 --> 00:37:20,450
Father! Father!

543
00:37:20,919 --> 00:37:23,854
Come, Mr. Naqvi.

544
00:37:26,824 --> 00:37:27,848
Greetings.

545
00:37:27,926 --> 00:37:31,657
Greetings. Mulana is
waiting for you impatiently. Come in.

546
00:37:36,601 --> 00:37:39,229
Greetings. -Asab.

547
00:37:39,804 --> 00:37:41,533
Kamil Akmal Asab.

548
00:37:41,606 --> 00:37:44,632
Meaning? -He too will
face the same consequence..

549
00:37:45,543 --> 00:37:48,842
..he'll die without a funeral.

550
00:37:51,149 --> 00:37:54,744
We've shed lots of
blood on the land of atheists.

551
00:37:55,453 --> 00:37:56,784
A lot.

552
00:37:57,455 --> 00:38:02,518
But we never gave them
a live evidence till date.

553
00:38:03,161 --> 00:38:06,722
But this time our
teaching seemed to be flawed, Naqvi.

554
00:38:06,798 --> 00:38:10,791
Naqvi, find out
that during the training..

555
00:38:11,302 --> 00:38:12,826
..which feeling of Jehad..

556
00:38:12,904 --> 00:38:16,635
..fundamentalism and
extremism couldn't get through him.

557
00:38:16,841 --> 00:38:19,742
We've surely been slack somewhere.

558
00:38:21,112 --> 00:38:22,136
Scum Asab!

559
00:38:22,213 --> 00:38:27,446
Before surrendering to
atheists, how could he forget..

560
00:38:28,353 --> 00:38:32,187
..that in India he had to
avenge the death and disgrace..

561
00:38:32,256 --> 00:38:35,157
..of brothers and
sisters of his community.

562
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:38,328
I pity your misfortune.

563
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:43,394
your condition is like a
stray dog, with no place to go.

564
00:38:45,937 --> 00:38:49,270
I don't care forthreats, inspector.

565
00:38:51,275 --> 00:38:53,607
Do you remember
the incident of Kandhar..

566
00:38:54,612 --> 00:38:57,240
Entire country watched helplessly.

567
00:38:58,516 --> 00:39:03,385
Brought Maulana to
Afghanistan with love and handed to us.

568
00:39:04,155 --> 00:39:07,522
We just want one chance..

569
00:39:07,825 --> 00:39:11,420
..and we'll divide India into pieces.

570
00:39:12,196 --> 00:39:15,427
We'll wipe your name even
from the face of the world. -Enough!

571
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,127
If you say a word more against India..

572
00:39:17,201 --> 00:39:20,398
..I'll pull your
tongue out. -your India..

573
00:39:27,178 --> 00:39:28,440
He wants that..

574
00:39:31,516 --> 00:39:32,540
Hit me!

575
00:39:33,551 --> 00:39:37,214
Hit me! I want to die, atheists.

576
00:39:37,588 --> 00:39:40,352
My mission is accomplished. After me..

577
00:39:40,692 --> 00:39:43,525
..more people will
come with the same mission.

578
00:39:43,594 --> 00:39:46,529
I was in Taj. I'm here too.

579
00:39:46,831 --> 00:39:48,924
And I was behind
bomb last in the train too.

580
00:39:49,767 --> 00:39:50,927
Hit me!

581
00:39:51,335 --> 00:39:53,599
We started it..

582
00:39:54,372 --> 00:39:57,364
..and we've to find
the way to its conclusion.

583
00:39:58,743 --> 00:39:59,767
We..

584
00:40:00,311 --> 00:40:06,250
Don't worry. They can't
harm us even after nabbing Asab.

585
00:40:06,851 --> 00:40:09,911
He'll misguide them
so much that they'll..

586
00:40:10,154 --> 00:40:12,748
..get lost trying to find the truth.

587
00:40:16,194 --> 00:40:19,391
Victory and defeat is their dilemma.

588
00:40:19,764 --> 00:40:21,925
Our men will be around Asab too.

589
00:40:22,834 --> 00:40:24,768
No matter how much
security they put around him..

590
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:29,666
..our one blow will prove
costly to their entire system.

591
00:40:30,475 --> 00:40:33,876
If this happens, it will be very good.

592
00:40:34,946 --> 00:40:35,970
Or else..

593
00:40:36,814 --> 00:40:40,272
..we've to act like a chameleon.

594
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,581
you fool!

595
00:40:44,655 --> 00:40:47,920
Because of traitor Muslims like you..

596
00:40:47,992 --> 00:40:51,826
..our Indian Muslims are embarrassed.

597
00:40:52,563 --> 00:40:53,894
you scum!

598
00:40:57,268 --> 00:40:58,735
We're helpers.

599
00:41:00,204 --> 00:41:02,570
We help the community.

600
00:41:03,474 --> 00:41:05,442
Even God has said..

601
00:41:06,177 --> 00:41:09,237
..that there is always room for penance.

602
00:41:10,148 --> 00:41:13,140
If not penance, let's spread religion.

603
00:41:13,551 --> 00:41:17,180
But Maulana, spreading
religion is helping the religion.

604
00:41:17,255 --> 00:41:19,485
We too are helpers.

605
00:41:20,491 --> 00:41:21,958
Listen, Naqvi.

606
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:24,928
Before International Media..

607
00:41:25,296 --> 00:41:27,321
..goes to the village of Asab..

608
00:41:27,765 --> 00:41:31,599
..go there and
destroy all the evidences..

609
00:41:31,936 --> 00:41:34,962
..before they create a problem for us.

610
00:41:35,373 --> 00:41:37,238
It will be done today, Maulana.

611
00:41:37,308 --> 00:41:39,333
We need to do one more thing. -What?

612
00:41:39,544 --> 00:41:42,707
Close all ourtraining camps.

613
00:41:43,181 --> 00:41:46,878
And move all the trained men.

614
00:41:47,318 --> 00:41:50,810
Now they won't spread
violence, but preach religious.

615
00:41:51,556 --> 00:41:52,580
Listen.

616
00:41:53,324 --> 00:41:55,417
These days India's media..

617
00:41:55,693 --> 00:41:57,991
..is spreading propaganda against us.

618
00:41:59,664 --> 00:42:02,258
Every nook and corner is being searched.

619
00:42:03,568 --> 00:42:07,868
They're inciting hatred against us.

620
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,434
The Indians we had bribed..

621
00:42:11,676 --> 00:42:14,270
..can't take the risk to come out..

622
00:42:14,345 --> 00:42:17,542
..so we've to
accelerate this movement more.

623
00:42:20,751 --> 00:42:22,844
you scoundrel! Speak up!

624
00:42:25,323 --> 00:42:27,814
This is called death of humiliation.

625
00:42:29,827 --> 00:42:31,522
I understand you.

626
00:42:32,296 --> 00:42:35,788
you mean Mission Mumbai? -yes.

627
00:42:36,801 --> 00:42:39,861
He's hanging between heaven and hell.

628
00:42:40,671 --> 00:42:42,764
And he has put us..

629
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,432
..under crown of thorn.

630
00:42:44,842 --> 00:42:50,280
I think he couldn't
understand the feeling of martyrdom.

631
00:42:50,982 --> 00:42:54,543
He'll die every minute at the hands..

632
00:42:54,619 --> 00:42:57,918
..of atheists like a living corpse.

633
00:42:59,657 --> 00:43:01,522
you rogue!

634
00:43:05,796 --> 00:43:07,821
We've to settle many scores now.

635
00:43:08,733 --> 00:43:11,361
How could Asab
forget that these atheists..

636
00:43:11,435 --> 00:43:13,767
..turned valley into a wriggling corpse.

637
00:43:14,505 --> 00:43:19,602
And this carnage in Gujarat..

638
00:43:19,844 --> 00:43:23,712
How could Asab forget that ourwomen..

639
00:43:23,781 --> 00:43:27,376
..and our honorwere trampled upon.

640
00:43:27,585 --> 00:43:30,782
Asab has to pay for every count.

641
00:43:31,322 --> 00:43:33,790
Maybe his faith has been shaken.

642
00:43:34,292 --> 00:43:35,350
Mr. Naqvi.

643
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:40,393
Didn't you show him
the video of riots in 1992.

644
00:43:40,464 --> 00:43:43,194
Haji, you know that..

645
00:43:43,401 --> 00:43:45,699
..it's an
important part of ourtraining.

646
00:43:46,637 --> 00:43:49,731
We've to brainwash them with hatred..

647
00:43:49,807 --> 00:43:51,434
..to strengthen their determination.

648
00:43:51,509 --> 00:43:52,908
Forgive me.

649
00:43:52,977 --> 00:43:55,241
But this time your brainwash..

650
00:43:55,613 --> 00:43:56,773
..was in vain.

651
00:43:57,348 --> 00:44:00,340
I wish Asab had been martyred.

652
00:44:00,418 --> 00:44:02,249
If he had been martyred..

653
00:44:02,553 --> 00:44:05,420
..then entire
evidence and interrogation..

654
00:44:05,489 --> 00:44:07,719
..would've died under paperwork.

655
00:44:08,125 --> 00:44:12,653
But I fearthat
rogue might spill the bean.

656
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:15,824
Impossible! He'll die..

657
00:44:16,934 --> 00:44:19,368
..but he won't squeal.

658
00:44:19,437 --> 00:44:23,271
I've made every
Mujahiddin (mercenary) into steel.

659
00:44:23,908 --> 00:44:28,208
It's theirfirst duty to
pierce through crowd of thousands..

660
00:44:28,279 --> 00:44:30,440
..and succeed in their mission.

661
00:44:31,315 --> 00:44:33,943
In ourtraining we
teach them to accept..

662
00:44:34,185 --> 00:44:35,880
..death but not to speak up.

663
00:44:47,965 --> 00:44:50,229
The nabbed
terrorist Asab is from Okara..

664
00:44:50,301 --> 00:44:52,201
..district of Faridpur in Pakistan.

665
00:44:52,269 --> 00:44:54,430
His name is Amir Akmal Asab.

666
00:44:54,505 --> 00:44:56,530
yes. This mercenary is revealing..

667
00:44:56,607 --> 00:44:58,541
..all the secrets in narco test.

668
00:44:58,743 --> 00:45:01,906
And he's exposing all
the secrets of this attack.

669
00:45:02,913 --> 00:45:04,107
your name..

670
00:45:04,548 --> 00:45:06,641
Mohammed Akmal Kamil Asab.

671
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:10,278
Where are you from?

672
00:45:10,755 --> 00:45:13,246
Faridpur district.

673
00:45:14,225 --> 00:45:15,249
Who send you?

674
00:45:15,893 --> 00:45:17,258
Uncle!

675
00:45:18,295 --> 00:45:19,319
Where are you from?

676
00:45:19,797 --> 00:45:21,924
Lahore. District Faridkot.

677
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,768
Why did your uncle
send you here from Lahore?

678
00:45:24,835 --> 00:45:28,271
To kill people. He said as
long as you're alive, kill them.

679
00:45:28,739 --> 00:45:30,138
How many did you kill?

680
00:45:30,207 --> 00:45:34,143
I don't know, sir.
I kept killing blindly.

681
00:45:35,312 --> 00:45:37,246
How many bullets did
you fire to shoot people?

682
00:45:37,815 --> 00:45:38,839
I don't know, sir.

683
00:45:38,916 --> 00:45:42,579
We were just shooting
wildly. We emptied around 2 magazines.

684
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:46,187
2 magazines! But why
did you kill the people?

685
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:50,426
They said you'd get heaven if you kill.

686
00:45:50,494 --> 00:45:52,428
So we did that.

687
00:45:54,165 --> 00:45:58,932
And sir, they said it's
Jehad. We all came forJehad.

688
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:02,400
One name has propped up in this attack.

689
00:46:02,473 --> 00:46:06,910
Asab's boss is called 'Uncle'.

690
00:46:07,311 --> 00:46:10,542
He had send Asab
to kill innocent people.

691
00:46:30,701 --> 00:46:33,465
Greetings. -Please sit down, general.

692
00:46:43,948 --> 00:46:47,577
The sweat on your
face shows your restlessness.

693
00:46:48,352 --> 00:46:49,944
you're right, Maulana.

694
00:46:51,222 --> 00:46:53,452
Actually the tide of
time seems to be changing.

695
00:46:54,758 --> 00:46:59,320
Nobody can predict the outcome now so..

696
00:46:59,396 --> 00:47:02,194
So your
restlessness has brought you here.

697
00:47:03,634 --> 00:47:05,625
Can we know the reason of your arrival?

698
00:47:07,138 --> 00:47:10,574
We're under pressure
of International government.

699
00:47:10,841 --> 00:47:13,605
So we want.. -Forgive me, sir.

700
00:47:17,214 --> 00:47:21,583
We know very well
what you want, general.

701
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:27,350
you came here to arrest me.

702
00:47:28,692 --> 00:47:33,152
you think that our arrest
will make you big in stature.

703
00:47:33,797 --> 00:47:37,756
And I'll watch my
humiliation in helplessness.

704
00:47:37,835 --> 00:47:39,200
Maulana..

705
00:47:39,837 --> 00:47:41,896
..it's our duty to protect you.

706
00:47:42,806 --> 00:47:47,334
But don't forget, your
existence is because of us.

707
00:47:47,545 --> 00:47:50,343
Marvelous!

708
00:47:51,348 --> 00:47:55,148
My existence is because of them.

709
00:47:55,786 --> 00:47:59,187
you protect me?

710
00:47:59,423 --> 00:48:03,723
As long as our brave men
spread fire in the valley..

711
00:48:04,161 --> 00:48:06,823
..they kept chanting slogans..

712
00:48:06,897 --> 00:48:10,264
..you kept on hearing the commotion..

713
00:48:10,334 --> 00:48:13,235
..till then in front
of International media..

714
00:48:13,304 --> 00:48:16,603
..you talked of peace in Kashmir.

715
00:48:16,674 --> 00:48:20,872
But afterthe election
there, your mood changed.

716
00:48:21,612 --> 00:48:25,378
When carnage kept increasing in India..

717
00:48:25,449 --> 00:48:28,179
..you kept getting promotions.

718
00:48:29,286 --> 00:48:30,810
Mr. Naqvi is right.

719
00:48:34,425 --> 00:48:36,655
It's not the right time
to be emotional, Mr. Naqvi.

720
00:48:37,828 --> 00:48:41,320
Do you think by
putting up this training camp..

721
00:48:41,832 --> 00:48:43,732
..turning few into extremists..

722
00:48:44,301 --> 00:48:45,734
..sending them across the border..

723
00:48:46,237 --> 00:48:49,764
..and by killing some
innocents in bomb blasts..

724
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,307
..you're doing a favor on us?

725
00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:57,438
Don't forget that you live
and prosper under our shelter.

726
00:48:58,449 --> 00:49:03,682
By the way, it's not right
to take undue advantage of lies.

727
00:49:04,688 --> 00:49:07,156
The day we take our protection back..

728
00:49:07,224 --> 00:49:09,624
..you won't find a roof to shelter you.

729
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:12,693
Marvelous, Naqvi!

730
00:49:13,631 --> 00:49:16,395
Is this the magic of voice or manner..

731
00:49:17,167 --> 00:49:19,499
..he expressed his
emotions without hurting my heart.

732
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:21,401
Wow, Maulana! -Sir..

733
00:49:21,739 --> 00:49:26,108
The way you're sugar
coating this humiliation..

734
00:49:26,443 --> 00:49:30,106
..it's very easy to
guess your intentions.

735
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:32,205
We too know your intentions very well.

736
00:49:32,283 --> 00:49:34,649
But we doubt your intentions.

737
00:49:35,219 --> 00:49:39,178
And your restlessness has
brought you to our doorstep.

738
00:49:39,623 --> 00:49:42,319
you're right, sir.
It's a very small thing.

739
00:49:42,893 --> 00:49:45,191
We all are riding in the same boat.

740
00:49:45,929 --> 00:49:48,921
If you think that we're culprits..

741
00:49:49,667 --> 00:49:53,296
..then forgive me, you too aren't holy.

742
00:49:53,504 --> 00:49:55,233
I want to explain that..

743
00:49:55,706 --> 00:50:00,837
..you're restless only
because our one soldier got nabbed.

744
00:50:00,911 --> 00:50:04,142
you're bitter, but you're right.

745
00:50:04,481 --> 00:50:08,417
Actually he's in the dilemma now.

746
00:50:09,253 --> 00:50:11,721
He doesn't know what to do.

747
00:50:12,423 --> 00:50:14,914
So he thought that I should try to..

748
00:50:15,159 --> 00:50:18,151
..test strength
with Azhar Mehmood. -Right?

749
00:50:18,228 --> 00:50:22,562
Maulana, I'm answerable to
both the government and public.

750
00:50:22,766 --> 00:50:25,428
General, people don't
call me Maulana for no reason.

751
00:50:26,236 --> 00:50:29,228
you're protector of the
government. you answerto them.

752
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:32,704
But I live in the hearts of the people.

753
00:50:33,377 --> 00:50:38,178
On our one gesture, there is revolution.

754
00:50:39,516 --> 00:50:42,383
And if I'm harmed even a bit..

755
00:50:42,853 --> 00:50:47,449
..then you'll
invite one more revolution.

756
00:50:49,226 --> 00:50:54,254
And nobody can save your
uniform from getting blemished.

757
00:50:58,769 --> 00:51:03,399
you can do whatever you want to do.

758
00:51:04,475 --> 00:51:07,808
I'll do what I've to do.

759
00:51:09,246 --> 00:51:12,443
It's time for my prayers. Bye.

760
00:51:58,228 --> 00:51:59,889
Uncle, he was the one..

761
00:52:00,531 --> 00:52:02,362
..who killed my mother and father.

762
00:52:02,733 --> 00:52:06,396
My father and I
were waiting forthe train.

763
00:52:06,937 --> 00:52:10,373
He came and shot my father and mother.

764
00:52:10,441 --> 00:52:13,808
My father and motherfell on me.

765
00:52:14,178 --> 00:52:17,443
When I got up, I saw corpses all around.

766
00:52:18,382 --> 00:52:21,283
He was going in blue colored T-shirt..

767
00:52:21,351 --> 00:52:23,444
..with bag and gun in hands.

768
00:52:25,489 --> 00:52:29,186
Why did you kill my parents? Tell me!

769
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:57,531
This is Maulana Azhar Masood.

770
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:02,807
This is Haji and this is Naqvi.

771
00:53:05,382 --> 00:53:08,317
And this king, Asab is in ourterritory.

772
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:15,549
The game has changed.

773
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:20,496
Now only we're
going to lose in every move.

774
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:28,528
King! It's our duty to save Asab.

775
00:53:32,476 --> 00:53:34,444
And to retreat from here..

776
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,811
..will be ourweakness.

777
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:40,974
It means..

778
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:43,810
..to keep Asab safely..

779
00:53:45,355 --> 00:53:47,118
..will be checkmate to them.

780
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:50,523
And to get truth out of him..

781
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:54,056
..will be their defeat.

782
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:36,797
yourface expressions show..

783
00:54:37,707 --> 00:54:40,642
..that you found out
who has sent this letter..

784
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:42,305
..and why.

785
00:54:43,914 --> 00:54:45,347
This is the same letter..

786
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:48,907
..that you wrote to your mother.

787
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,319
What happened to my mother?

788
00:54:53,356 --> 00:54:54,653
your boss..

789
00:54:55,892 --> 00:54:57,723
..that uncle..
only he can tell you this.

790
00:54:58,361 --> 00:54:59,851
you don't even know his name.

791
00:55:00,997 --> 00:55:03,397
Uncle! Uncle!

792
00:55:03,834 --> 00:55:08,794
Actually that uncle's full
name is Maulana Azhar Masood.

793
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:13,070
yourthat uncle will
tell you where your mother is..

794
00:55:13,877 --> 00:55:15,344
..and what happened to her.

795
00:55:15,879 --> 00:55:17,779
This letter has come back.

796
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:21,974
Nobody lives on that
address now. -It's a lie.

797
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:25,852
you don't know what's
right and wrong and you came here.

798
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:30,857
Father.. Mohammed Amir Imam.

799
00:55:32,562 --> 00:55:33,893
Mother, Nooribi.

800
00:55:35,031 --> 00:55:38,933
Village Faridpur.
Okara Punjab. Pakistan.

801
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:41,994
This was the address that you wrote.

802
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:43,403
It's my address.

803
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:46,103
But now everyone is missing.

804
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:49,671
Nobody from yourfamily live there now.

805
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:52,379
Before your letter..

806
00:55:53,316 --> 00:55:56,376
..media gave this news very clearly..

807
00:55:57,921 --> 00:55:59,855
your uncle and Pakistani government..

808
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:03,253
..destroyed all the
evidences connected to you so that..

809
00:56:03,326 --> 00:56:06,557
..we can't prove to
them that you're a Pakistani.

810
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:08,524
I'm a Pakistani.

811
00:56:10,267 --> 00:56:14,363
My father is a vendor
in Faridpur in Pakistan.

812
00:56:17,741 --> 00:56:21,939
But alas! Now nobody is at that address.

813
00:56:22,979 --> 00:56:26,312
And Pakistan
government has disowned you too.

814
00:56:26,783 --> 00:56:29,581
Now give as much evidence as you want..

815
00:56:29,653 --> 00:56:33,089
..but nobody will
believe that you're a Pakistani.

816
00:56:34,291 --> 00:56:37,818
Because forthe entire
world you're a blemish that..

817
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:41,523
..Pakistan government
will never accept as its own.

818
00:56:43,033 --> 00:56:46,992
Because of this
reason Pakistan government..

819
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,698
..made yourfamily disappear.

820
00:56:53,343 --> 00:56:55,004
I want to talk to my mother.

821
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:58,347
She loves me very much.

822
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:03,280
She gets restless when I'm in pain.

823
00:57:03,453 --> 00:57:06,911
Mother is a mother,
whether it's yours or mine.

824
00:57:07,624 --> 00:57:10,684
The mourning and curses of the mothers..

825
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,786
..of those innocent people you killed..

826
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:16,897
..will they every forgive you?

827
00:57:18,068 --> 00:57:20,935
Those sighs
widowed sisters and mothers..

828
00:57:21,004 --> 00:57:23,370
..won't let you sleep in peace.

829
00:57:25,709 --> 00:57:26,801
Do you want to know..

830
00:57:27,477 --> 00:57:33,382
..among the people you killed
in VT station more were Muslims?

831
00:57:35,719 --> 00:57:37,346
What kind of a Muslim are you?

832
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:43,358
What will you answerto your God!

833
00:57:44,561 --> 00:57:46,654
On Judgment Day God will..

834
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:49,457
..ask why you killed many innocent..

835
00:57:49,532 --> 00:57:51,432
..people on your uncle's order.

836
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:52,627
Why did you kill them?

837
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:56,294
But this is Jehad. And Jehad is for God.

838
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:59,097
Do you understand the meaning of Jehad?

839
00:58:00,944 --> 00:58:05,438
Were the innocent people
you killed dangerfor Islam?

840
00:58:09,452 --> 00:58:12,785
Today the biggest
dangerfor Islam is you.

841
00:58:13,757 --> 00:58:17,022
you should be hanged.

842
00:58:19,796 --> 00:58:22,856
Because of few people like
you today Islam is in danger.

843
00:58:23,433 --> 00:58:25,663
Because of people like you..

844
00:58:25,735 --> 00:58:30,570
..this sacred religion of
peace has come under suspicion.

845
00:58:32,442 --> 00:58:36,401
Everyone looks at
true Muslim with doubt today.

846
00:58:37,313 --> 00:58:38,974
They're considered terrorists.

847
00:58:39,883 --> 00:58:44,877
Why is every true Muslim
scared to reveal his identity today?

848
00:58:45,889 --> 00:58:48,585
Because some
terrorists like your uncle, Haji..

849
00:58:48,892 --> 00:58:54,057
..and Naqvi have made
themselves the guardian of Islam.

850
00:58:55,498 --> 00:58:57,090
Koran says it clearly..

851
00:58:59,402 --> 00:59:01,427
you follow your
religion. Let them follow theirs.

852
00:59:02,472 --> 00:59:03,837
you follow your religion.

853
00:59:04,974 --> 00:59:06,805
Let them follow theirs.

854
00:59:15,785 --> 00:59:17,480
Suicide is a sin in Islam.

855
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:22,255
There is no place in heaven
forthose who die sinful death.

856
00:59:23,426 --> 00:59:26,020
So how can you human-bombs go in heaven!

857
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:30,494
I'm ashamed to call you a Muslim.

858
00:59:31,701 --> 00:59:33,862
Muslims of my
country are betterthan you.

859
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:37,896
They didn't even let your companions..

860
00:59:37,974 --> 00:59:40,534
..get buried in their cemetery.

861
00:59:41,845 --> 00:59:45,611
Do you rememberthe
taxi you blasted with bomb?

862
00:59:46,649 --> 00:59:48,082
That driverwas a Muslim too.

863
00:59:49,953 --> 00:59:54,481
you forced his widow
wife and orphan children to beg.

864
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:58,622
Muslim means one with firm faith..

865
00:59:59,829 --> 01:00:01,888
..one who believes in God.

866
01:00:02,866 --> 01:00:05,699
you just passed sixth
grade and you'll explain..

867
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:07,895
..us the meaning of Islam and Jehad.

868
01:00:09,405 --> 01:00:12,772
Do you know about
the prayers and rituals?

869
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:16,341
Have you read the Koran?

870
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:20,378
No! But I've read Koran.

871
01:00:22,552 --> 01:00:23,712
I'm ashamed of you.

872
01:00:28,358 --> 01:00:30,019
Hail India, sir!

873
01:00:30,894 --> 01:00:33,795
I'm saluting the Indian who taught..

874
01:00:33,863 --> 01:00:36,525
..me the real meaning of Jehad.

875
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:41,627
I wish I had understood
this meaning of Jehad earlier.

876
01:00:42,872 --> 01:00:45,568
God never closes the doorto penance.

877
01:00:50,013 --> 01:00:54,040
Sir, now I'll give you
every truth of this attack.

878
01:00:54,184 --> 01:00:57,551
This conspiracy started in Pakistan.

879
01:00:58,454 --> 01:01:01,048
I met Laskhar in
Rawalpindi forthe first time.

880
01:01:02,425 --> 01:01:04,552
After choosing 25 boys..

881
01:01:04,627 --> 01:01:08,563
..we were trained
vigorously for 21 days.

882
01:01:08,631 --> 01:01:12,465
The way a soldier is
trained before going to war..

883
01:01:12,535 --> 01:01:16,938
..we were made
physically strong forthis mission.

884
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:20,833
Fast!

885
01:01:32,956 --> 01:01:35,982
Then we were prepared
mentally with religion teachings.

886
01:01:37,393 --> 01:01:40,885
Forthat we were
introduced to a man called..

887
01:01:40,964 --> 01:01:43,660
..'Uncle' in the world of terror.

888
01:01:45,001 --> 01:01:46,434
Greetings.

889
01:01:48,071 --> 01:01:49,436
Greetings.

890
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:53,740
Greetings. May God be with you!

891
01:02:15,665 --> 01:02:16,689
Jehad.

892
01:02:17,967 --> 01:02:21,494
Jehad is a feeling for soul.

893
01:02:22,705 --> 01:02:27,438
Every step on the path of God is Jehad.

894
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:29,772
Soulful Jehad!

895
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:37,047
Whenever Muslims had been in trouble..

896
01:02:38,855 --> 01:02:41,722
Whenever our
community had been under attack..

897
01:02:42,659 --> 01:02:47,756
Whenever Islam had
been in danger, we did Jehad.

898
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:51,459
Our community waged warforJehad.

899
01:02:53,469 --> 01:02:57,929
Whenever you hearthe word Jehad..

900
01:02:58,341 --> 01:03:01,310
Then think that it's time for sacrifice.

901
01:03:01,811 --> 01:03:02,835
Sacrifice..

902
01:03:03,046 --> 01:03:07,346
..our peace, rest, children..

903
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:10,719
..and everything that we own.

904
01:03:11,688 --> 01:03:14,350
To make us assassins..

905
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:16,486
..uncle brainwashed us.

906
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:19,323
His powerful preaching and sermon..

907
01:03:19,595 --> 01:03:24,794
..would stir up our mind and body.

908
01:03:24,867 --> 01:03:29,827
you're my pride! you're my duty!

909
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:33,070
And those who betray his duty..

910
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:35,709
..will never be forgiven by God!

911
01:03:35,778 --> 01:03:38,338
He'll get hell!

912
01:03:39,749 --> 01:03:42,616
We've to continue ourJehad.

913
01:03:42,685 --> 01:03:45,848
We were made to
take oath to kill atheists.

914
01:03:45,922 --> 01:03:49,517
So that we don't show
mercy on anyone during carnage.

915
01:03:49,592 --> 01:03:55,929
We've to spread Islam! Help us, God!

916
01:03:59,068 --> 01:04:00,330
you can go now.

917
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:04,496
Goodbye. -Goodbye.

918
01:04:07,643 --> 01:04:10,806
Maulana. Maulana.

919
01:04:12,081 --> 01:04:16,313
yourteachings
about Jehad is really great!

920
01:04:17,553 --> 01:04:22,616
Nothing is more
sacred than Jehad, Mr. Naqvi.

921
01:04:24,827 --> 01:04:31,357
Jehad means to walk on the path of God.

922
01:04:32,001 --> 01:04:33,525
God, help us!

923
01:04:33,736 --> 01:04:37,604
Afterthat we got
training in using arms.

924
01:04:38,074 --> 01:04:39,905
It was very strict.

925
01:04:40,643 --> 01:04:43,077
During this we get
detailed information..

926
01:04:43,312 --> 01:04:45,303
..on the use of modern weapons.

927
01:04:46,082 --> 01:04:48,676
Ourtrainers would take us to camps..

928
01:04:48,751 --> 01:04:51,652
..where we learnt to use AK-47..

929
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:55,122
..revolvers, machine guns and grenades.

930
01:04:55,691 --> 01:04:58,717
Mr. Naqvi was in
charge of this training.

931
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:00,586
And this..

932
01:05:02,331 --> 01:05:03,798
..is rocket launcher.

933
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:06,825
It can blow big building in a minute.

934
01:05:07,804 --> 01:05:11,535
Nobody can
withstand it. Put it like this.

935
01:05:12,308 --> 01:05:14,299
And then press the trigger.

936
01:05:20,616 --> 01:05:22,550
Remember one thing, son.

937
01:05:23,619 --> 01:05:26,452
Don't hurt my feelings.

938
01:05:27,824 --> 01:05:29,519
I get furious..

939
01:05:30,626 --> 01:05:33,493
..when I see video of
injustice done on our community.

940
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:37,931
yourteachings and
feelings should be strong.

941
01:05:38,634 --> 01:05:41,603
And yourfaith should be fresh.

942
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:43,969
your passion should be such..

943
01:05:45,308 --> 01:05:48,436
..that you should give
life, but never speak up.

944
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:53,640
We've to get success
in our mission at any cost.

945
01:05:54,484 --> 01:05:58,716
We've told you about the
weakness of Indian securities.

946
01:05:59,856 --> 01:06:05,317
We hope that your one blow
will shake their entire system.

947
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:09,256
Ourwork is love
towards our nation and Jehad.

948
01:06:09,532 --> 01:06:14,902
Any attempt on the path
of God never goes in vain.

949
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:27,446
Then we took the guns and
started the lessons of Jehad.

950
01:06:28,451 --> 01:06:32,911
Now we had only one
aim. To kill the atheists.

951
01:06:36,292 --> 01:06:40,422
During the training many
army generals would to come.

952
01:06:41,931 --> 01:06:43,728
They would take information about..

953
01:06:43,799 --> 01:06:45,494
..ourtraining from the trainers.

954
01:06:46,602 --> 01:06:49,537
They would assure
that government is with them.

955
01:06:50,773 --> 01:06:52,934
Actually uncle and
Naqvi run this training..

956
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:54,840
..camp with the help of government.

957
01:06:55,811 --> 01:06:57,642
And they're responsible for it.

958
01:06:58,915 --> 01:07:01,907
The groups related to
the mission has to answer..

959
01:07:01,984 --> 01:07:04,452
..to the government from time to time.

960
01:07:05,821 --> 01:07:09,621
Their meetings were aimed at
improving mutual co-ordination.

961
01:07:11,427 --> 01:07:14,328
Often they would
discuss the strength and..

962
01:07:14,397 --> 01:07:16,865
..weakness of Indian security system.

963
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,662
It was done under
government's protection.

964
01:07:23,973 --> 01:07:28,535
I rememberthe night of
21st November. We were in Karachi.

965
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:31,710
Uncle made us offerthe night prayer.

966
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:35,848
Then everyone prayed to God for success.

967
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:40,784
Afterthat uncle gave us the
last sermon before the journey.

968
01:07:41,424 --> 01:07:44,325
Kids, yourtraining has been completed.

969
01:07:44,393 --> 01:07:48,659
Now it's the time for
which we waited for long.

970
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:51,393
Now we've to move towards victory of..

971
01:07:51,467 --> 01:07:53,731
..Islam and true devotion to God.

972
01:07:53,803 --> 01:07:55,430
A new dawn awaits us!

973
01:07:55,504 --> 01:08:00,305
This mission is a revenge.
It's a struggle. It's a Jehad.

974
01:08:00,776 --> 01:08:03,870
Islam arises after Karbala (holy war).

975
01:08:03,946 --> 01:08:06,437
It's a long series
of gaining after losing.

976
01:08:06,515 --> 01:08:08,642
Sacrifice are never in vain, kids!

977
01:08:08,718 --> 01:08:10,879
Money has been sent to yourfamily.

978
01:08:10,953 --> 01:08:13,444
your parents and
siblings are responsibilities..

979
01:08:13,522 --> 01:08:17,925
..of the community.
-God will protect them!

980
01:08:17,994 --> 01:08:21,259
He'll give them
courage and success to us.

981
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:23,890
Atheists have hurt our heart.

982
01:08:23,966 --> 01:08:27,868
This wound is making us restless.

983
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:33,500
We'll get rest on the day you
get success in mission in India.

984
01:08:34,844 --> 01:08:41,044
Hail God! Hail God!

985
01:08:42,652 --> 01:08:49,057
Hail God! Hail God!

986
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:53,955
Hail God! Hail God!

987
01:08:54,030 --> 01:08:56,897
And we 10
mercenaries had only one mission.

988
01:08:57,933 --> 01:09:00,629
As long as we live,
we should keep killing.

989
01:09:01,504 --> 01:09:03,438
We entered Mumbai and spread carnage.

990
01:09:03,939 --> 01:09:06,237
This is the biggest terrorist attack.

991
01:09:06,308 --> 01:09:07,707
After blast in taxi..

992
01:09:07,777 --> 01:09:11,907
..terrorists have started
firing in Oberoi hotel and cafe.

993
01:09:12,415 --> 01:09:15,248
Terrorists are shooting innocent people.

994
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:17,308
you can hearthe fire shots.

995
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:21,789
It's coming from Trident
Hotel. Entire Mumbai is in chaos.

996
01:09:21,857 --> 01:09:25,349
At this moment everyone
is wondering what's happening.

997
01:09:25,428 --> 01:09:27,726
Everyone is glued to his TV set.

998
01:09:28,531 --> 01:09:33,559
These serial attacks
are a well planned conspiracy.

999
01:09:35,037 --> 01:09:37,528
There is continuous
firing in Nariman House..

1000
01:09:37,606 --> 01:09:39,267
..Trident Hotel and Taj Hotel.

1001
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:41,707
Two terrorists have been spotted.

1002
01:09:41,877 --> 01:09:46,678
They're heavily armed
and on destructive spree.

1003
01:09:46,749 --> 01:09:50,583
Never before such a
terrorist attack taken place in India.

1004
01:09:50,653 --> 01:09:52,416
Entire nation is in a state of shock.

1005
01:10:21,117 --> 01:10:23,847
yes. I'm coming by the local train.

1006
01:10:24,854 --> 01:10:27,414
Greetings, sir. -How
are you, yadav? -Fine. -Fine?

1007
01:10:27,490 --> 01:10:29,981
When did you return from
Allahabad? -4 days ago. -Ok.

1008
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:32,357
How is family? -Fine.

1009
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:15,426
Many innocent
people died in firing at CST.

1010
01:12:15,931 --> 01:12:18,422
Constable Prasant
Shinde died in the attack.

1011
01:12:19,935 --> 01:12:21,835
Did you see the taxi blast?

1012
01:12:21,904 --> 01:12:25,931
I think this cabbie must be a Muslim.

1013
01:12:26,976 --> 01:12:30,571
One has to pay for
the company one keeps!

1014
01:12:30,646 --> 01:12:32,614
May God send him to heaven!

1015
01:12:35,918 --> 01:12:37,010
yes, kids.

1016
01:12:37,086 --> 01:12:40,351
We've spread corpses on VT station.

1017
01:12:40,756 --> 01:12:43,657
Stacked up corpses at VT station?

1018
01:12:44,493 --> 01:12:46,518
Marvelous!

1019
01:12:46,595 --> 01:12:49,359
Now what's the next orderfor us, uncle!

1020
01:12:49,431 --> 01:12:55,495
Keep killing them! Wipe the atheists.

1021
01:12:55,571 --> 01:12:59,337
It'll be done,
uncle. Don't worry. What next?

1022
01:13:00,075 --> 01:13:04,705
Kill them! Spread corpses all around.

1023
01:13:07,082 --> 01:13:10,882
Listen. Hold people
hostage in high numbers.

1024
01:13:11,353 --> 01:13:15,983
Then we can negotiate
with the Indian government.

1025
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:18,492
We'll place our demands.

1026
01:13:19,528 --> 01:13:24,966
Have patience! God
is with the patient ones!

1027
01:13:25,034 --> 01:13:29,801
Keep spreading destruction!

1028
01:13:34,443 --> 01:13:35,467
How are you?

1029
01:13:35,544 --> 01:13:38,104
Just passing time. -Want this?

1030
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:41,645
No. you eat it. -you
weren't to be seen on duty yesterday.

1031
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:52,427
Hey.. hey..

1032
01:14:12,614 --> 01:14:14,411
It's very late. Go now.

1033
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:18,684
But mom.. -Please.
Don't argue. Go to sleep.

1034
01:14:22,624 --> 01:14:24,888
We got news ACP Suersh Amle..

1035
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:28,396
..encounter
specialist Vijay Sargaonkar..

1036
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:31,956
..and ATS chief Suman
Khare are going to the crime scene.

1037
01:14:32,034 --> 01:14:34,594
It's a challenge forthe Mumbai police..

1038
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:37,036
..to handle this attack on common man.

1039
01:14:37,106 --> 01:14:42,100
Senior officers are getting
ready to tackle the situation.

1040
01:14:42,378 --> 01:14:45,779
Terrorism which has
spread in entire world..

1041
01:14:45,848 --> 01:14:48,646
..has stepped in India once again.

1042
01:14:49,018 --> 01:14:51,885
Police and government are totally alert.

1043
01:14:53,122 --> 01:14:55,488
The scene of carnage is heart-rendering.

1044
01:14:55,557 --> 01:14:58,754
But now the question
is how can one believe..

1045
01:14:58,827 --> 01:15:01,489
..that this isn't a
work of demon but human.

1046
01:15:05,034 --> 01:15:09,403
First blast was in Vile Parle taxi.

1047
01:15:09,905 --> 01:15:11,998
Firing was here.

1048
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:16,672
yes. -Terrorists are
firing at CST station. -Now?

1049
01:15:17,046 --> 01:15:20,675
yes, sir. Two
terrorists are firing blindly here.

1050
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:22,674
Oh my God.

1051
01:15:24,053 --> 01:15:26,681
That means from Vile Parle to CST.

1052
01:15:27,489 --> 01:15:29,013
It's possible their next target could..

1053
01:15:29,091 --> 01:15:30,649
..be building of Times of India.

1054
01:15:31,693 --> 01:15:35,652
Police headquarter
isn't nearby, but BMC office is.

1055
01:15:36,298 --> 01:15:37,663
BMC office could be the target.

1056
01:15:39,401 --> 01:15:41,426
The situation is very grave, gentleman.

1057
01:15:42,304 --> 01:15:43,328
It's possible..

1058
01:15:43,405 --> 01:15:46,966
..Oberoi hotel or Air
India building could be the target.

1059
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:48,566
No. I don't think so.

1060
01:15:48,644 --> 01:15:52,512
