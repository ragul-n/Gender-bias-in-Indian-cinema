Varanasi. Year 1327
(Bengali calendar)

12
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,598
Have you seen the monkey?

13
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,429
- A monkey got into the house?
- I mean your precious son

14
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,758
I boiled milk for him,
but he vanished

15
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,238
The boys in this neighbourhood...

16
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,750
It's so crowded; how can I
keep an eye on him here?

17
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,031
Isn't there a school nearby?

18
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,436
If he went there,
I'd have a rest from worry

19
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,598
You said it was for Khoka

20
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,431
You'll have some, too, from now on.
It's in the kitchen

21
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,234
- Won't you go to market?
- Of course. What should I get?

22
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,839
I'll tell you, but...

23
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,749
Thinking of money?
I don't have to pay in cash

24
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,190
He'll give you credit?

25
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,916
Do you think I supply all those
herbal medicines free?

26
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,432
Then bring some mustard oil,
some kerosene and some spices

27
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:23,078
See if you can get some mung dal...
mung or masoor, or whatever

28
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,229
Apu's been asking for khichree since
he had some at the ghat the other day

29
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,555
Can you get some paan masala?

30
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,757
- What brand?
- I don't know

31
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,236
The woman upstairs gave me some

32
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,233
Find out the name
and I'll bring it tomorrow

33
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,239
I met a sweet-seller I knew.
He says he has rheumatism

34
00:07:54,880 --> 00:08:00,989
I'm taking him some medicine. I could
ask him for some cream from Kashi

35
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,237
Shall I ask him for some?

36
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,957
Let the medicine work first

37
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,236
Aren't you going to bathe
in the Ganga?

38
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,829
If you don't, you won't get salvation

39
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,430
They've just arrived.
Let them settle in first

40
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:43,431
They will bathe, pay homage
to Vishwanathji-all in good time

00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,438
Water

43
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,430
Apul Wait

44
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,349
Aren't you hungry?
Have you eaten anything outside?

45
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,430
And a pedha as well

46
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,270
- Is Ray-mashai at home?
- No

47
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:24,069
I've a calendar for him. I came home
too late to give it to him last night

48
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,837
Shall I put it in his room?

49
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,149
We bring one out every year

50
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,193
You'll find all the important
holy days in it

51
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,758
The holy festivals are marked in red,
so they're easy to see

52
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,750
O Lord of the world, those who have
faith in you are the blessed ones

53
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:01,434
Those who worship you are the holy
ones, those who praise you...

54
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:06,589
Look! She weeps with her head
on Krishna's breast

55
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,438
I'll tell my brother

56
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,794
Then Jatila quietly takes her brother
Ayan to her hiding place and says:

57
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,591
"Look at that.
See what your wife is up to

58
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,237
"She weeps with her head
on Krishna's breast"

59
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,838
You see what has happened
meanwhile?

60
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,238
Krishna tells Radha: "Lay a flower
at my feet as an offering...

61
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,791
"...and I'll take the form of the
goddess Kali, to please Ayan"

62
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,598
Want to swing a club?

63
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,511
Anything else?

64
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,238
- What's the name of the man upstairs?
- Nanda-babu

65
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:49,439
Tell him that mother has used all
the matches and father isn't home yet

66
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,759
Ask him for just two matches

67
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:24,192
I'll swing it, then

68
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,632
Khoka, come in

69
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,833
- What do you want?
- Matches

70
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,431
- What will you do with matches?
- Mother wants them

71
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:12,080
That's my medicine. I'm ill, you see.
Doctor says to take it every evening

72
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,438
Only two matches, mother said

73
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,429
Take the whole box,
I have more of them

74
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,955
Tell your mother that Nanda-babu
says she need not return it

75
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,596
You have a fine voice

76
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,433
It seems you are a singer, too

77
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,759
I used to be

78
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,990
Do you live nearby?

79
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:53,839
I wondered if I could have some tea.
It's chilly, my throat is sore

80
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,830
See how I've brought tealeaves,
tied to the end of my wrapper

81
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,999
Come along, I live quite near,
in Ganesh Mohalla

82
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,434
You don't mind? My name is
Kalicharan Banerji, from Satkhire

83
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,435
Lord knows whether it's all right

84
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,158
- I want some, too
- Later. Give them this tea first

85
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,749
Then come back and take the sweets

86
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,237
Excellent tea

87
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,436
Where is your son?
He is a good boy

88
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:25,350
On Tuesday I'll take you to a feast
at the palace of Teota

89
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,550
Will you come?

90
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:33,429
Every year they have a feast
at the palace...

91
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,079
Will you mind if I take your son?

92
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:53,553
My friend, I have saved about 400
rupees, starving most of the time

93
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:59,910
Another hundred or so and I can get
myself a bride from a decent family

94
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,752
You can't be happy without a family
of your own, can you?

95
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,753
- You wouldn't know of any girl...
- I'm afraid not

96
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:57,553
The Pandeys have gone to the Ramlila
performance. Can't you take Apu, too?

97
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,836
Would you take these?

98
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,836
You're burning with fever

99
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:36,430
I went to the market, then to
the sweet-seller, for the cream...

100
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,829
...then to the ghat
for evening prayers

101
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,070
Then as I was climbing the steps...

102
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,639
Apu has gone out to buy fireworks

103
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,636
Why do you need Apu?

104
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,152
- Shouldn't we call a doctor?
- Don't bother

105
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,631
I'm not going to listen to you

106
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:14,279
In that tin box there are some
herbal medicines

107
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,676
Give me a dose

108
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,790
Mix well with juice of ginger
and honey

109
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:28,395
Let me try it. If I'm not better
by tomorrow, then we'll see

110
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,798
Sit with your father, he's ill

111
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,831
Which fireworks did you buy?

112
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:57,189
They're not as good as those
in Nishchindipur, are they?

113
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,634
Were you watching the fireworks
from the terrace

114
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,674
- Who is calling you?
- Shambhu

115
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,674
He lives in Kukurgali,
he's not a Bengali

116
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:18,159
Is he your friend? The one
who teaches you English?

117
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,070
...and they send me an invitation

118
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,639
What is "Apu bhalechheley"
in English?

119
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,029
- Why not invite him in?
- He's going to set off fireworks now

120
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,630
- You want to go with him?
- Yes

121
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,638
Go, then

122
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,031
- How are you feeling now?
- Much better

123
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:14,032
You gave me such a fright.
You must have caught a chill

124
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,519
Take things easy,
you're earning enough

125
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,433
Sit for a while

126
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,998
There's work to be done.
I have to make Apu's bed

127
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:38,913
The sweet-seller told me about
a dwelling near the Man Mandir

128
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:44,439
On the first floor, two rooms, facing
south. The rent is seven rupees

129
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,315
There are markets and schools nearby.
Khoka won't have any problems

130
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,114
We'll talk about it
when you're better

131
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:55,279
- What is the boy doing?
- Can't you hear him?

132
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,432
But for the monkeys,
Kashi would be a good place

133
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,509
- Are you going out?
- Don't I have to go to the ghat?

134
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:50,112
- Can't you stay, after such a fever?
- I'm all right, the medicine worked

135
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,754
You'll climb all those steps...

136
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,279
I didn't hear anything in the night,

137
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:32,109
we came back late
from the performance

138
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:38,077
My wife was going to the ghat
when she heard he had collapsed

139
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,032
I hope he hasn't hurt himself

140
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,671
For one thing, he has a chest cold

141
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:56,671
The room is damp. Close the door
and windows, to keep the cold out

142
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,112
Someone come with me,
I'll prescribe medicines

143
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,118
I'll come with you myself

144
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:22,109
If you need anything,
don't be shy to ask

145
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:26,597
If you have mustard oil and camphor,
rub his back and chest with them

146
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,870
Ganga...

147
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,199
Go to the ghat, get a pot of water
and run back at once

148
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,956
He'll be back at any moment

149
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,477
Khoka is back

150
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,629
Pay your respects
to your great-uncle

151
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,670
- How old is he?
- He is ten now

152
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,070
- When was he given the sacred thread?
- After coming to Kashi

153
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,834
Will you come with me?

154
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:26,959
I can't make up my mind.
I hadn't thought of leaving here

155
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,798
I didn't know when you were coming

156
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:37,029
I always come at this time. I did
not know you were so badly off

157
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,675
- What are your employers like?
- Good people

158
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,799
They'll be going to Dewanpur

159
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,591
So I can't make up my mind

160
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,630
Think it over. I am here for
a few more days

161
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:03,952
If you stay at my house, it gets
lived in and you'll have no problems

162
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:31,880
Get out at once!

163
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,108
Bou-than, are you making paan?

164
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,638
No, the one next to it

165
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,798
There's a leather purse there

166
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:43,078
You're coming with us, aren't you?
We're going to Dewanpur next month

167
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:48,272
I told you that I would take you
if I liked your work

168
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,798
I hope you'll agree.
Have you any relatives here?

169
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:57,076
Nor where you come from?
So you might as well come with us

170
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:09,797
Mokshada says you've lost
your appetite. Are you well?

171
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,594
Go and open that drawer

172
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:44,794
Tell them in the other house
that Thakur-mashai is back

173
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,790
Mother! A train!

174
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:12,392
I've brought firewood.
Have you enough food?

175
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,557
Yes, enough until tomorrow

176
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:19,595
I'll come back tomorrow. Whenever
you need anything, just tell me

177
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,356
- You haven't told me your name
- Nirupama

178
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:47,792
I'm here for another week or so;
will you be settled in by then?

179
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:57,952
Apu, come with me tomorrow. You can
learn what you have to do as a priest

180
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:18,793
Place the deity on the throne
and put some tulsi leaves on him

181
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,591
No, wash them first

182
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,470
What's the matter with you?

183
00:49:54,200 --> 00:50:00,275
You've been sulking since morning.
Are you ill? Are you feeling sad?

184
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:07,279
Are you missing Kashi,
or Nishchindipur?

185
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:12,279
Don't you like it here in Mansapota?

186
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,949
Have they been rude to you?

187
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,558
Have you been doing
your job properly?

188
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:25,271
They are good people here. If we keep
them happy, our livelihood is secure

189
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:31,078
Bear it for a few years. Then we may
be able to go back to Nishchindipur

190
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,837
Mother, I want to go to school

191
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:39,189
Which school?

192
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:41,869
Nearby, in Arboal. It's a good school

193
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,878
How do you know it's good?

194
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,435
I've seen it

195
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,837
- What about your work?
- That's mornings; school's afternoon

196
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:55,069
Can you do both? Don't you need
money to go to school?

197
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:01,589
Haven't you any money put away,
mother?

198
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:29,273
Are the sweets
and everything else ready?

199
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,595
Only half an hour left

200
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:15,597
I'll attend to it, sir

201
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:46,078
- What is the subject now?
- Bengali, sir

202
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:54,269
The Foliage of Literature.
What does foliage mean?

203
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,879
Foliage means...

204
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,672
It means green leaves, sir

205
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,439
The Land of Bengal

206
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:25,033
Where is the greenest land of all?

207
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:29,711
Where on tender grass
your feet must fall?

208
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:39,599
It is our Bengal, our very own Bengal,
the greenest land of all

209
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,394
Where do the thrush and robin sing?

210
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:57,675
In our Bengal, our very own Bengal,
the greenest land of all

211
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:03,029
In what land do they speak a tongue
that fills your soul with yearning?

212
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:08,440
Where do you hear such clear tones
of a baul whose heart is singing?

213
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:19,036
Where's the signature?
Why isn't it done?

214
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:31,034
Come and sit down.
Is your mother well?

215
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,231
The Inspector was very happy with you

216
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:37,235
Not that I was any less happy

217
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:43,757
I've kept an eye on your progress,
I've spoken to Abinash-babu about you

218
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,269
He is above average

219
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:52,031
We expect a great deal from you

220
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:58,192
On our part, we shall provide you
with every facility

221
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:06,033
But if you want to be a really good
student, work hard. Especially...

222
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:10,436
...you'll have to improve
your English

223
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:15,668
Do you like reading?
I don't mean textbooks

224
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:21,034
Books about travel,
lives of great men...

225
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:27,311
...books about science... if I give
you such books, will you read them?

226
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:32,033
Of course he will read them

227
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:38,155
I have many such books here

228
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:38,837
Where do weaverbirds nest again,
where do swallows cry for rain?

229
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:44,235
If you don't read such books,
you cannot broaden your mind

230
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:49,550
We may live in a remote corner
of Bengal...

231
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:54,516
...but that does not mean that
our outlook should be narrow

232
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:02,038
This book is about the North Pole

233
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:08,833
From this book anyone can learn about
the aurora borealis or the Eskimos

234
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:16,832
You can learn about Africa

235
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:22,319
This is the story of inventions

236
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:29,274
Here are biographies of scientists:

237
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:52,074
The sun, the earth and the moon.
The moon goes around the earth

238
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:56,069
When the shadow falls here,
that's an eclipse

239
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:02,514
Come in, Apurba

240
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,111
You've come second in the district

241
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:20,558
You'll study further, won't you?

242
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:24,628
You can get
a scholarship of ten rupees

243
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:35,151
You'll continue your studies?

244
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:38,398
In Calcutta? Arts or sciences?

245
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:43,877
Have you anywhere to stay there?
Any relatives?

246
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:52,078
Anyway, that's not a problem.
Have you spoken to your mother?

247
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:54,032
Not yet

248
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:57,875
- Can you get her to agree?
- I will try

249
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:24,954
I came second in the district,
there's only one above me

250
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:32,672
I might even get a scholarship,
money for doing well in examinations

251
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:35,674
- How much?
- Ten rupees a month

252
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:41,230
But only if I continue my studies

253
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,994
Do you think
they'll give it just like that?

254
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:49,475
I must go and study in Calcutta

255
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,950
What is this, mother?

256
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:28,194
You're going?

257
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:29,595
Why not?

258
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:36,992
He gave me some addresses

259
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,077
Who's going to pay for it?

260
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:42,158
The college will be half free

261
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:45,079
I'll get ten rupees
a month, I'll find work

262
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:52,276
If you give up your job as a priest,
will they take care of us then?

263
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:54,994
So I must stick at being a priest?

264
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:59,068
Why not? You're a priest's son.
Do you want to be a governor?

265
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:03,154
Yes! Must everything be as you wish?

266
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:04,595
Everything!

267
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:25,677
There are snakes, mosquitoes
will bite you. Come back

268
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:29,957
All right, you can go to Calcutta,

269
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:34,513
but you must think things over first

270
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:40,040
- Why hit me?
- I'm sorry. I'll show you something

271
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:02,034
Whose is that?

272
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:09,038
When I worked in Kashi,
do you know how much I saved?

273
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,195
Thirty-two rupees

274
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:20,757
I'll give you something from this,
enough to last out a month

275
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:33,674
The headmaster gave it to me.
It's a globe, it shows our earth

276
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:38,914
See, these are the countries,
and the blue is the sea

277
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,838
See where Calcutta is?

278
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:52,949
- It's seven-thirty
- Come and see where I've put things

279
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:57,993
There's your tumbler, your bowl,

280
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:02,034
sweets in the bowl, some spices...

281
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:06,633
Here's some ghee
I've made from cream

282
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:10,435
Your shirts and vests...

283
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:13,638
...and the dhobi is in the bedding

284
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:25,273
Five rupees from the purse
and twenty-five from me

285
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,631
The key, keep it safe

286
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:13,073
Come home
at the puja festival, if you can

287
01:06:56,760 --> 01:07:00,275
Have you ever tripped
and hurt yourself?

288
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:05,959
If not, you'll have
plenty of opportunities

289
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:12,357
This wonderful balm will come to
your aid like a benevolent friend

290
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:44,794
Akhil-babu?

291
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,151
- I have a letter
- What letter?

292
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:09,998
From the headmaster of Arboal School

293
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:29,678
Paresh wrote to me about this

294
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:38,079
You've come here to study?

295
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:42,558
Any money?

296
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:48,239
I have twenty-nine rupees and six
annas after paying the train fare

297
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,158
Can I get a room here?

298
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:59,510
I have only the one room,
but we'll manage with it

299
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:00,915
What rent?

300
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:04,869
Can you work in the printing shop?

301
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:10,270
At night, after classes?

302
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:17,997
Go upstairs and you'll find the room;
I'll be up in a moment

303
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:41,952
Dear mother, I have arrived safely.
Akhil-babu has arranged for my stay

304
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:47,951
I won't pay rent, I'll work
in the printing shop

305
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:04,996
Couldn't you find a better place
to sleep than CCB's class?

306
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:07,957
Are you crying?

307
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:14,359
Come on, we've two free periods
after this. Let's go for a walk

308
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:35,951
Apu, don't you wish to go abroad?

309
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:39,394
Find me a job on a ship

310
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:44,953
I'm serious.
Let's go together, shall we?

311
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:50,992
No ambitions?

312
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:55,273
You'll stay like a frog in a well,
even if you get the chance?

313
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:01,950
Mother will never let me go

314
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:09,273
She didn't even want me to come here,
although it's only 3 hours by train

315
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:15,359
I have ambitions, or I'd have stayed
there. I even had a job there

316
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:19,277
- What job?
- That of a priest

317
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:25,032
The family profession? You wear the
sacred thread? No Brahman's pigtail?

318
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:33,796
We've missed two classes today

319
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:47,314
We slipped up. We should have told
Pranab to answer for us at roll call

320
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:51,512
No problem in PNG's class

321
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,954
Have you grown taller?

322
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:39,395
So you're thinner

323
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:41,559
Did you get my letter?

324
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:43,638
I'm not speaking to you

325
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:47,480
You said holidays were from the 7th.
What's the date today?

326
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:49,353
I had some work

327
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:52,672
Admit you didn't want
to come to your mother

328
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:07,192
Apu, you'll catch cold

329
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:26,879
- What do they give you to eat there?
- Everything

330
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:33,955
Lentils, rice, fish, vegetables

331
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:37,312
- Who does the cooking?
- There's a cook

332
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,318
A good cook?

333
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:09,478
Stop reading

334
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:19,312
Talk to me.
What have you seen in Calcutta?

335
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:23,309
- Everything
- Tell me, then

336
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:28,674
Victoria Memorial,
Whiteway Laidlaw...

337
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:34,313
...Hogg Market,
the zoo, Fort William...

338
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:38,711
The temple at Kalighat?

339
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:44,950
Yes, I went there the other day.
And Keoratala...

340
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:47,551
What's in Keoratala?

341
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:11,478
When will you pass your examinations
and get a job? Can I stay with you?

342
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:18,679
Rubbish

343
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:24,318
What if I'm seriously ill?
Such things happen

344
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:29,311
Every evening
I feel feverish and dizzy

345
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:32,636
I've no appetite at all

346
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:37,312
I've often thought of telling you,
but I haven't

347
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:44,918
When you're able to earn money,
will you arrange treatment for me?

348
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:18,597
Want paan?
Did you hear what Niru said?

349
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,877
You'll go, won't you?

350
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:29,949
- Why not? She's asked you many times
- I've classes on Monday

351
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:34,119
What does it matter
if you are two days late?

352
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:40,115
You have so few holidays

353
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:44,911
There are no holidays
until New Year

354
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:28,631
There's never time for packing in the
morning. I have to run for the train

355
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:54,313
Sunrise is at quarter past six
tomorrow. Wake me in good time

356
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,479
I'm late

357
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:47,310
- Won't you check everything?
- There's no time

358
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:42,916
I missed the train

359
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:48,554
I'll go tomorrow

360
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:52,759
Won't it upset your studies?

361
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:06,679
- Would you like something to eat?
- Later, mother

362
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:43,713
Dear Apu,
why don't you write regularly?

363
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:47,838
I worry when I don't hear from you

364
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:53,513
If you have a holiday during
the Ganesh puja, come home

365
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:58,920
I haven't seen you for two months

366
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:03,512
If you haven't enough money,
I'll send you some

367
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:13,314
There are no Ganesh puja holiday
in my college, and I have exams soon

368
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:18,839
If I don't stay in Calcutta,
my studies will suffer

369
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:50,832
Every day I think of calling,
but I never manage it

370
01:31:56,640 --> 01:31:58,073
Heard from Apu?

371
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:02,317
Is he well?

372
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:09,159
Your son is a gem. You should get him
married, your worries would be over

373
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:13,155
You're alone, and every day
I think of visiting you,

374
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:15,715
but there's never time

375
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:19,510
Yesterday, my son-in-law
arrived from Kalna

376
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:25,512
They have a shop there.
He and his father look after it

377
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:30,669
But what goings-on there are

378
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:35,317
Three sons, and grandchildren, too

379
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:39,030
The mother died, and the father
soon remarried

380
01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:12,755
Cremation ground

381
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:16,674
What shall I do with so much?

382
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:25,829
I can't stay now. I must go and
prepare medicine for Kumi's cough

383
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:28,680
I'll come this evening, if I can

384
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:33,957
Don't be cross, but we've written
to your great-uncle

385
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:38,915
Why? He's an old man

386
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:40,514
Have you written to Apu?

387
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:48,196
Apu has a holiday
today and tomorrow

388
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:52,030
Is he coming? Shall I write to him?

389
01:33:55,320 --> 01:33:59,393
If he comes, he must come
because he wants to

390
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:08,395
His examinations are around the
corner. It's best if he stays there

391
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:10,591
You mustn't write to him

392
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:14,717
Promise me you won't

393
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:25,710
I'll come again,
and so will the others

394
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:31,791
- Shall I shut the door that's open?
- I'll do it later

395
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:35,390
All right, I'll leave these
on the veranda

396
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:58,798
I never expected to find you here

397
01:34:59,680 --> 01:35:02,353
Didn't you say you were leaving town
for two days?

398
01:35:02,680 --> 01:35:06,559
To your village... Mansapota?

399
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:13,194
I can't study there, I fall asleep

400
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:16,159
- Won't your mother be angry?
- No, I've fixed that

401
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:22,951
I've sent her a money order,
from the bonus Akhil-babu gave me

402
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:28,038
Aren't you nervous?

403
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:32,393
A little. I'm not quite ready
for the chemistry paper

404
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:08,155
There's a letter for you

405
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,479
Is it from your mother?

406
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:22,951
From Niri-di. Mother is ill

407
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:25,197
Is it serious?

408
01:41:56,800 --> 01:42:01,749
Don't cry, Apu.
Parents don't stay with you forever

409
01:42:07,720 --> 01:42:09,597
It's what had to happen

410
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:16,715
Now you'd better perform
the shraddha and then stay here

411
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:22,554
You'll earn enough as a priest

412
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:58,197
Where are you off to?

413
01:43:05,120 --> 01:43:08,590
- Why Calcutta?
- For my examinations

414
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:12,951
And your mother's shraddha?

415
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:15,800
I'll take care of that in Calcutta,
at Kalighat
