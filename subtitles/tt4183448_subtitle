Over here in this city murder
cases, happen every day.

20
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:07,900
But case number 29878/

848977.

22
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:19,422
As I was sleeping in the off duty
this case came searching for me.

23
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:22,955
On the neck there were marks of
pulling and breaking the chain.

24
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:28,789
As per prima facie evidence.

25
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:32,126
Yet another murder while mugging.

26
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:38,706
But at night where there are
only druggies and prostitutes...

27
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:41,812
...in this neighborhood of city.

28
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:41,197
This is the house where I grew up.

29
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:54,016
My Mama.

30
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:55,908
A very old birth day
which is in memory.

31
00:13:56,101 --> 00:14:00,243
In an orphanage run by Father
Geevarghese at Kottayam.

32
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:02,352
My 7th birth day.

33
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:09,184
In the file at Orphanage an arbitrary
date which someone has written.

34
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:21,335
On my 7th birth day only 'Blakes'
from America visited my orphanage.

35
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:27,442
May be due to birth day luck among
that much kids, I won the lot.

36
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:35,318
After a week along with
them I came here.

37
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:40,085
New country, new house,
new father and mother.

38
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:43,453
Along with that a new name!

39
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,960
Varun Blake.

40
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,106
But over here also
things were not easy.

41
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:01,234
At the school for my friends
I was a strange creature!

42
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:05,347
For the white skinned
parents a black skinned son!

43
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,590
There is a question which
I ask even today to myself.

44
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:17,888
On that day my Mama's
white finger instead of me...

45
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,894
...what if it pointed on
yet another face?

46
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:24,566
What will my life be?

47
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:31,033
Living in anyone ofthe cities in India,
a factory worker living miserable.

48

So I believe you all might
have known the news already.

57

58
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:01,816
Hello mother, how are you now?
Is there pain?

No pain butfeeling tired.

60
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:09,724
Brother told mother is not taking
medicines properly, why is that?

61
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:11,592
Is it cold there?

62
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:15,128
No mother it not cold here.
Its a good climate, a while ago...

63
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:18,393
...l reached at office. Mother you
don't think about all that and worry.

64
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:20,594
Take medicine and eat food
properly and try to take rest.

65
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,205

I saw you during the cake cutting.

70
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:16,465
That's good we are old class mates.

When did we last meet?

72
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:22,534
After that I went to Bangalore.

73
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:27,081
Notthat from now on all the
recruitments should be citizen's...

74
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:29,481
...from here, no? Isn't it what is said?

75
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:35,020
What is husband doing?

76
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:26,501
That is, must be a citizen from here.

77
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:27,701
And then?

78
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:36,886
Do you know the reason why saying
only the citizens from here will do?

79
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:44,755
If there are some white
skinned in ourteam...

80
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:47,860
...can avoid the ill-fame that
lndian's snatched away theirjobs!

81
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:50,761
Sir, except that candidate
Rohini Mathew all the rest are...

82
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:55,962
Rohit! As a company's CIO project
management is not my job.

When Ijoined Infotech, our MD
Mahesh Murthy's primary business...

89
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,363
...was palm oil import.

90
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:07,296
He had started all this business
as a style operation of 'Pranchiettan'

91
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:13,442
After closing that oil company...

92
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:16,477
...that Mahesh Murthy is
the CEO of this company.

93
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:22,508
Over here the closed door talks are,
you are the next CEO of the company.

00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:29,924
Why late at office? - Nothing
should complete some work.

95
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:33,256

But to compensate that,
there is yet anotherthing okay.

...l even offered a job at Infotech.
Just for fun.

103
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,196
What is this man? Who is this?
Is it Balamurali Krishna?

104
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,238
For the landscape in
America, he won't suit at all.

105
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:01,240
Try some Michel Jackson
or something like that.

106
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:10,613
This is business contract.

107
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:14,520
We've quoted 20% less
than the Chapman solutions.

108
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:23,093
Don't I know you'll check all that?

00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:50,889
Happy with what is there.

118
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,132

OurAkash was thrown
out by the university people.

121

122
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:10,177
...l've no idea what to do with him.

123
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:15,411
I'm thinking why
not bring to Infotech?

124
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:18,884
In life there should be
some responsibility, isn't it?

125
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:22,781
I don't get any other
idea, do you feel any other?

126
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:27,719

I'd seen our old Prashanth.

Do you remember Prashanth?
Fat guy with glass?

147

No, that is 'Gundu' Prashanth. This
is that lean, one who pissed in pants.

At 9th I also left convent school
and joined a government school.

Father's unexpected death.

153

Only after death, came to know
that father had lot of debts.

154
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:39,122
Then mother struggled
a lot and grew us up.

155
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:46,333
Although late at that time
I understood one thing.

156
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:53,204
In India, if one is born with 'cross
belt' I mean born with 'sacred thread'.

157

00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:58,959
From where did you
learn all this cooking?

172
00:45:59,156 --> 00:46:02,535
Mother is the guru. During the
childhood I used to do home work...

173
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:05,136
...along with mother by
sitting at the kitchen.

174
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:08,835
Withoutthe smoke, smell and noise
of kitchen, Maths won't come to me.

175
00:46:12,302 --> 00:46:21,052
"Searchin some shores 9
I and you all alone"

176
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:25,221
"As winter descends, we
are in some misty moon night"

177
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:30,395
If there is anyone to give me a
company, then cooking is not a big deal.

178
00:46:31,221 --> 00:46:34,327
To tell the truth, I relax
a lot while cooking.

179
00:46:35,926 --> 00:46:38,065
Now only seeing Krishna, happy.

180
00:46:38,262 --> 00:46:41,072
At the office you always
have a tensed look.

181
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:48,072
Right from my childhood my
desire was to become a chef.

182
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:53,351
If this l.T and internet weren't there
I'll be with some pot-belly and all.

183
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:58,050
By chewing some pan, will be stirring
some sambar in some wedding house.

184
00:46:59,116 --> 00:47:01,118
Look, at last for the taste.

191
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:17,101
Nagesh came to know Emmy
Williams through a dating web site.

192
00:48:17,694 --> 00:48:20,937
That too two days
just before the murder.

193
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:23,670
May be might have thought
ofa one night stand...

194
00:48:24,001 --> 00:48:25,207
...with Emmy and gone.

195
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:32,513
From Emmy I got the details
of the restaurant where they went.

196
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:37,153
But from the restaurant
didn't get any vital clue.

197
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:42,323
Surveillance camera
footage from that anything!

198
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:44,632
Now that is the only hope.

201
00:52:43,593 --> 00:52:44,901
Why sitting here?

202
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:50,143
The court decree is
shouldn't come 50 feet near me.

203
00:52:54,971 --> 00:52:58,714
We both are like two
shores of a river.

204
00:53:03,246 --> 00:53:06,625
Like a small boat,
Trisha who connects us.

205
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:22,738
I did the masters here in Brown. We
met at the university's Indian club.

206
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:27,508
The beginning was through
friendship, Varun liked me.

207
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:34,349
For me also but when looking back
now. Was it love or an escape...

208
00:53:34,477 --> 00:53:36,479
...from an forced arranged
wedding by the parents.

209
00:53:36,646 --> 00:53:38,819
On asking that I don't know.

210
00:53:48,992 --> 00:53:50,369
Sit.

211
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:00,572
After Trisha was
born, Varun's insecurities.

212
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:05,976
Lot of anger issues
are there for Varun.

213
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:08,816
Unnecessary blaming.

214
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:14,956
Even on the anger of an argument.

215
00:54:18,722 --> 00:54:20,759
It was an accidental firing.

216
00:54:59,562 --> 00:55:05,035
Nageshwara Rao's phone records.
Few days before the death happened.

217
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:10,315
Fortwo days on a particular
number more than 15 calls.

219
00:55:47,911 --> 00:55:51,051
From the surveillance camera
footage from the restaurant.

220
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:53,794
It is seen that Nagesh
talking to an unknown.

221
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:58,756
As if aware of the surveillance
camera's position.

222
00:55:58,988 --> 00:56:01,662
The suspect is standing
turning away from camera.

223
00:56:03,093 --> 00:56:05,596
Did Nagesh enter inside
that carat his will...

224
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:09,433
...or did suspect threaten
and take him?

225
00:56:13,903 --> 00:56:15,974
By hiding a weapon
inside the coat.

226
00:56:16,406 --> 00:56:18,852
The suspect threatens
and takes him...

227
00:56:18,975 --> 00:56:21,979
...that is Steve's argument.
That was not okay to me.

228
00:56:23,747 --> 00:56:26,091
Nagesh's body
language looks relaxed.

229
00:56:27,617 --> 00:56:30,757
If that is the case between
Nagesh and this suspect.

230
00:56:31,521 --> 00:56:33,592

Even if by sitting at night
for a while, get it done.

234
00:59:00,303 --> 00:59:02,613
But its just boring to work at night.

235
00:59:04,807 --> 00:59:07,879
Mr. Akash Murthy when
Ijoined this company.

236
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:10,316
This was 50 employee company.

237
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:21,196
Behind this success story I've
sacrificed many of my nights.

238
00:59:40,209 --> 00:59:42,348
There is a quote told
by Dr. Abdul Kalam.

239
01:00:09,872 --> 01:00:13,319
The case of Nagesh
had reached a dead end.

240
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:16,221
Just before the death.

241
01:00:16,412 --> 01:00:18,016
Of Phoenix trucking company's.

242
01:00:18,214 --> 01:00:21,627
Nagesh was one of the
smartest software engineers.

243
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:26,357
Because of his trip routing
software which he had designed.

244
01:00:26,723 --> 01:00:31,695
Was able to cancel 50 routes which
weren't profitable. For that company.

245
01:00:35,898 --> 01:00:38,708
Because ofthat re-routing,
within last 5 years...

246
01:00:38,835 --> 01:00:43,614
...257 drivers were terminated
by Phoenix trucking company.

247
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:46,878
If anyone of them, who
had lost theirjob...

strike like this in this country also.

team, all their unit was out sourced.

To India. -But still the terminated
employees their situation its a pity no?

252
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:17,139
Atlanta is running only because
of four major companies.

253
01:02:20,002 --> 01:02:21,982
So, all of a sudden when these
much people are Iay-offed.

254
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:31,115
Whoever does ourjob cheaper than
us, the project will go to them.

255
01:02:31,347 --> 01:02:34,817
But still on saying there
is no job all of a sudden.

256
01:02:36,819 --> 01:02:39,993
Anyhow I don't sympathize
on these white people at all.

257
01:02:40,156 --> 01:02:42,500
Because for a long time by
selling us they made money, no?

258
01:04:30,499 --> 01:04:31,842

Sir, you come you relax in this chair.

339
01:42:48,695 --> 01:42:49,730
Have you not gone so far?

340
01:42:49,963 --> 01:42:53,410
No, had told that should give
reportto Mr. Mahesh Murthi.

341
01:42:53,634 --> 01:42:55,272
That too in the afternoon.

342
01:42:56,770 --> 01:42:59,250
I'll give it fast and now itself, I'll...

343
01:43:00,707 --> 01:43:04,450
Mahesh sir is bit busy.
Have you stopped smoking?

344
01:43:07,314 --> 01:43:10,386
Smart boy!
Come, will have a smoke.

345
01:43:26,833 --> 01:43:29,643
Do you know the story of Kama?

346
01:43:30,871 --> 01:43:34,910
Karnan, means in the
Mahabharatha, Arjunan's...

347
01:43:35,475 --> 01:43:37,546
Will become as a brother.

348
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:43,856
Before the Mahabharatha war, Indra
Deva had understood one thing.

349
01:43:44,985 --> 01:43:50,196
For the success of his son Arjuna
there one person as a hurdle.

350
01:43:51,692 --> 01:43:53,262
Karnan.

351
01:43:57,364 --> 01:44:01,744
Because of protective shields only
Karnan can't be defeated by anyone.

352
01:44:03,604 --> 01:44:05,481
Then Indra did a gimmick.

353
01:44:06,340 --> 01:44:10,550
He dressed up as a Brahmin
and appeared before Karnan.

354
01:44:10,911 --> 01:44:14,290
And he begged this
protective shield as alms.

355
01:44:14,381 --> 01:44:18,693
As Karnan was a giver, he took off
his protective shield and gave to Indran.

356
01:44:19,052 --> 01:44:22,727
That is how in Mahabharatha
war Karnan failed.

357
01:44:23,690 --> 01:44:28,764
Now this is the question,
must answer honestly.

358
01:44:30,664 --> 01:44:34,009
If you were in the Karnan's
position what would you do?

359
01:44:36,603 --> 01:44:39,379
Honestly saying if I were the
one, I won't give it.

360
01:44:39,773 --> 01:44:44,779
Then what if some people comes
and asks I'm not mad at all to donate.

361
01:45:12,339 --> 01:45:15,752
You may go I'll give this
file to Mahesh Murthy.

362
01:46:29,850 --> 01:46:32,057
What happened? - What if that
girl goes and complaints?

363
01:46:32,419 --> 01:46:34,126
Who?
Asking who?

364
01:46:34,721 --> 01:46:36,632
I didn't do anything.
This is not our country.

365
01:46:37,791 --> 01:46:42,069
She is...Do you know one thing, I
was sitting here and listening to music.

366
01:46:42,396 --> 01:46:43,739
I can understand, you go
and wait in the car.

367
01:46:43,864 --> 01:46:46,674
She showed her character.
Sir, you wait in the car.

368
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:48,070
You believe me.

369
01:46:48,635 --> 01:46:50,637
Go, go.
What she says is.

370
01:46:50,737 --> 01:46:54,583
You talk and make her understand.
I understood. - I'll wait there.

372
01:47:52,766 --> 01:47:57,772
What a nuisance is this? She is
mad, didn't you speak to Michelle?

373
01:47:57,938 --> 01:47:59,212
What is she saying?

374
01:47:59,873 --> 01:48:06,586
She is adamant, if she presses
the case, its a huge law suit.

375
01:48:07,047 --> 01:48:10,187
Our company may even
lose the Cardgill project.

376
01:48:12,052 --> 01:48:14,555
If its known outside, its
a big stinking issue.

377
01:48:15,822 --> 01:48:19,998
We must somehow solve this,
you please talkto her once again.

378
01:48:23,063 --> 01:48:24,064
Why is that, like that?

379
01:48:26,733 --> 01:48:30,237
For the stupidity which is done by
sir why should I clean up that?

380
01:48:37,777 --> 01:48:38,187
Is it so?

381
01:48:40,780 --> 01:48:42,555
What is this Krishna?
Isn't it true?

382
01:48:43,583 --> 01:48:46,120
There is a news that new
CEO is coming for Infotech?

383
01:48:47,087 --> 01:48:49,192
What is heard is Akash
Murthy's name.

384
01:48:49,523 --> 01:48:53,938
That if when each directorsHThey
might have their own opinion, is it?

385
01:48:54,160 --> 01:48:57,141
Its not like that...
That's not what I heard.

386
01:48:58,031 --> 01:49:00,102
It was sir who suggested his name.

387
01:49:00,267 --> 01:49:01,974
Hey what is this?

388
01:49:02,135 --> 01:49:06,140
When there is your support, not him
anyone can run company, no?

389
01:49:06,239 --> 01:49:09,846
This is all one team work, no?
We as one family and all.

390
01:49:21,755 --> 01:49:23,860
But on this Saturday when
the board meeting is held.

391
01:49:24,291 --> 01:49:26,066
Sir will suggest my name!

392
01:49:32,198 --> 01:49:33,233
If not?

393
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:37,605
If not, I'll make Michelle
to press the case!

394
01:49:37,837 --> 01:49:41,284
Ho, big deal! Is she the
sister of Satyavan?

395
01:49:41,641 --> 01:49:45,088
If she says who is going
to believe what proof is there?

396
01:49:49,849 --> 01:49:52,853
This world will know what
this real Mahesh Murthy is.

397
01:49:55,055 --> 01:49:58,832
For doing pimping job to sir,
I should get some benefit is it?

398
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:05,334
You all peoplejointed,
is it forthis, I made you...?

399
01:50:05,699 --> 01:50:07,645
On the hand which fed
milk, on that hand itself...

400
01:50:12,305 --> 01:50:14,182
Sir what did you think of me?

401
01:50:15,041 --> 01:50:19,012
What to sir's whims and fancy, a
poor Brahmin lad who dances to it?

402
01:50:19,846 --> 01:50:22,656
Like old coconut oil business
by extracting everything.

403
01:50:22,782 --> 01:50:24,125
Do you think I can be thrown?

404
01:50:44,437 --> 01:50:46,110
Shall I go?

405
01:52:09,089 --> 01:52:11,126
Didn't you get my dinner invitation?

406
01:52:11,224 --> 01:52:13,795
Got it, why one formal dinner plan?

407
01:52:15,962 --> 01:52:18,943
There is something tricky on that.
Come on tell.

408
01:52:19,999 --> 01:52:21,034
I'll tell.

409
01:52:22,836 --> 01:52:24,144
One among that I'll say.

410
01:52:24,404 --> 01:52:27,317
This Saturday Infotech is going
to announce their new CEO.

411
01:52:36,549 --> 01:52:39,120
Since its office, can't
even love properly.

412
01:52:46,559 --> 01:52:50,302
Aaha, sister is not bad!
Look the lift has come, come.

No, nothing.

416
01:53:56,029 --> 01:54:02,878
Did that Michelle say anything?
No. What is it?

417
01:54:59,325 --> 01:55:00,998
What happened?

418
01:55:30,590 --> 01:55:33,571
I only had to face
violence from Varun.

419
01:55:39,933 --> 01:55:43,506
Between me and Michelle.
No otherthings had happened.

420
01:55:53,079 --> 01:55:55,650
A game to become a CEO, isn't it?

421
01:56:01,387 --> 01:56:04,266
Krish, there is something
called integrity.

422
01:56:05,124 --> 01:56:08,367
From a male that is
what a female desires a lot.

423
01:56:10,229 --> 01:56:14,336
Not even girl friend, even
the mother of Krish.

424
01:56:14,500 --> 01:56:17,174
To love such kind of a son.

I know I don't deserve that.

I've realized onething, which ever
designations I gain by hurting you.

Shall I ask a silly question?

441
02:18:37,942 --> 02:18:41,480
There are roots, branches and fruits.

442
02:18:41,680 --> 02:18:43,921
But its not a tree.

443
02:18:44,115 --> 02:18:47,494
Do you know the answer?
Human being.

444
02:18:48,420 --> 02:18:55,565
Yes! Human beings have un
seen roots, branches and leaves.

445
02:18:55,927 --> 02:19:01,809
The roots may be many. The
language, the nation, lovers.

446
02:19:01,933 --> 02:19:04,777
Mother, it can be anything.

447
02:19:05,670 --> 02:19:10,483
But all the roots search for the
dampness, its name is the same.

448
02:19:11,009 --> 02:19:15,958
The love, kindness, trust.

449
02:19:17,749 --> 02:19:21,959
Which grows in the dampness
of all this, that is life.

450
02:19:23,722 --> 02:19:28,432
Sometimes there may be rotten
leaves bearing the burden of...

451
02:19:28,626 --> 02:19:30,401
"disappointment, good
and bad doing.

452
02:19:30,628 --> 02:19:33,108
That must be blown off in the wind.

453
02:19:33,798 --> 02:19:40,147
Forthe new beginnings,
yes like our life.

454
02:19:41,773 --> 02:19:45,152

come beside my door?"
