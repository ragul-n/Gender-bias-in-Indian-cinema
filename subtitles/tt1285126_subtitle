1
00:00:57,612 --> 00:01:03,710
Right now, Typhoon Bolaven is quickly moving north, causing disturbance on northern region

2
00:01:04,452 --> 00:01:11,585
Especially in Mu Phu. A heavy rain, about 30ml/hour, falls on the region

3
00:01:11,626 --> 00:01:17,462
Director, look at this.../What do you think?
/A heavy rainfall pours on Si Yen area...

4
00:01:18,665 --> 00:01:20,463
Everything's impproved

5
00:01:20,501 --> 00:01:24,460
Viewers, I'm Weather Goddess,
Kim Hyun Woo..<i>l</i> Do you want

6
00:01:24,505 --> 00:01:28,464
to call her?<i>l</i> At the moment, rain and wind are so strong

7
00:01:33,714 --> 00:01:35,545
Right now, it's hard to even open our eyes and speak

8
00:01:35,716 --> 00:01:38,651
Extremely hard

9
00:01:43,524 --> 00:01:44,684
So refreshing

10
00:01:45,593 --> 00:01:50,428
There's a report a typhoon will hit this area

11
00:01:51,499 --> 00:01:53,660
Wind speed is 33.7 mile per hour

12
00:01:53,734 --> 00:01:59,468
Her name is Kim Hyun Woo, a 18 years old girl

13
00:01:59,607 --> 00:02:01,598
Keep shooting!

14
00:02:01,676 --> 00:02:05,407
Recently, the weather forecast had started. My friend,

15
00:02:05,446 --> 00:02:08,472
Kim Hyun Woo, entertains lonely guys

16
00:02:08,516 --> 00:02:11,679
That is all! I'm Weather Goddes, Kim Hyun Woo

17
00:02:13,554 --> 00:02:16,523
Viewers, today, with me...
. It's here!

18
00:02:17,725 --> 00:02:21,491
Yes, everyone loves her

19
00:02:30,671 --> 00:02:36,473
Let's catch twin rainbows with me, Go go go

20
00:02:52,626 --> 00:02:55,493
2 years later, when I resigned

21
00:02:55,663 --> 00:02:58,689
Hyun Woo becomes TV station weather report's staff

22
00:03:02,503 --> 00:03:07,634
Now, weather report. We will have longer summer this year

23
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:10,700
There will not be a significant
change of temperature

24
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:16,439
Because of air pressure
in China's western

25
00:03:16,484 --> 00:03:21,444
region, there'll be
slight breeze all over Korea

26
00:03:21,555 --> 00:03:25,685
But, there might be strong wind
in other area... . A breeze

27
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,623
So, a girl who wears a skirt
like me have to be careful.

28
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:33,498
That's today weather forecast
from Kim Hyun Woo

29
00:03:37,605 --> 00:03:43,601
Today, for my beloved one, I
have trained my body in the past 100 days

30
00:03:44,612 --> 00:03:49,640
I have to make her mine today. Let's just see

31
00:03:56,557 --> 00:03:59,549
Sorry, have you been waiting for me?

32
00:04:00,528 --> 00:04:01,552
Let's just end this

33
00:04:02,663 --> 00:04:03,687
So refreshing

34
00:04:04,532 --> 00:04:08,559
Let's go, I have prepared a surprise
for you.<i>l</i> I mean it

35
00:04:09,603 --> 00:04:13,539
Why? Because I'm late? Don't
be like that, it's our 100th day

36
00:04:13,574 --> 00:04:15,508
We break up calmly, OK?

37
00:04:19,513 --> 00:04:23,415
Someone who breaks up
stays calm, I think there's none

38
00:04:24,452 --> 00:04:27,615
At the time, I recalled my old nightmare

39
00:04:28,489 --> 00:04:30,684
She, from five years ago... On our 100th day D.3

40
00:04:31,592 --> 00:04:40,500
I really don't like you. I don't like
your smelly sweat, all over your body, from head to toe

41
00:04:40,568 --> 00:04:43,628
People stares at us, wipe off your smelly sweat

42
00:04:43,704 --> 00:04:46,400
But we break up like this...

43
00:04:47,508 --> 00:04:50,602
Two years ago, on
100th day D.18.. Noona

44
00:04:51,545 --> 00:04:52,637
You are my woman

45
00:04:54,482 --> 00:04:58,578
Doesn't matter whom you meet,
whatever you do, I will wait for you

46
00:04:58,719 --> 00:05:00,414
Actually

47
00:05:02,723 --> 00:05:05,658
What's this letter?<i>l</i> I'm going to
get married.<i>l</i> What, marriage?

48
00:05:06,694 --> 00:05:09,663
Of course this is real. Noona...

49
00:05:13,501 --> 00:05:17,631
I do think even in dating there are
rules. This is really uncool

50
00:05:17,705 --> 00:05:20,674
Our relationship that had just been going for 100 days,
then we just break up like this ?

51
00:05:21,442 --> 00:05:22,602
Yet, I want to be a cool person

52
00:05:23,644 --> 00:05:25,635
Just tell me. You...

53
00:05:27,481 --> 00:05:31,645
Have you ever loved me?
Her answer is so complicated

54
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,714
I'm not sure. Sorry

55
00:05:59,547 --> 00:06:04,507
What breeze? I was slapped by a typhoon

56
00:06:20,668 --> 00:06:25,435
I'm the house owner. He said
he'll have his 100th day anniversary

57
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:30,604
Candles everywhere, which burn
the curtains. But, there's no one there

58
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:32,705
That person...

59
00:06:33,447 --> 00:06:38,475
This afternoon there was fire in the house

60
00:06:38,586 --> 00:06:42,420
He said he'll have an anniversary
of his 100th day with his girlfriend.

61
00:06:42,456 --> 00:06:45,619
Lit up candles and
just left...

62
00:07:02,643 --> 00:07:06,545
How's everyone? I am here for Kang Joon Soo,
Kim Hyun Woo.

63
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:12,712
Is this really Kim Hyun Woo?<i>l</i> You're prettier
in person.<i>l</i> Thank you.<i>l</i> I'm a fan.

64
00:07:14,655 --> 00:07:17,488
My friend is a nice person,

65
00:07:17,558 --> 00:07:20,686
just a little off. So,
I'm sorry on his behalf

66
00:07:20,728 --> 00:07:23,595
Don't worry. Just leave it to the insurance.
done.<i>l</i> Thank you

67
00:07:24,431 --> 00:07:28,561
Although the heat's off, the 'price' I have to pay
is even worse. But, she is a good friend

68
00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:33,663
Thank you. Police officers are working hard too

69
00:07:37,611 --> 00:07:40,671
Let's take a picture. 1, 2, 3

70
00:07:45,552 --> 00:07:48,578
Let's drink.<i>l</i> Shut up, jerk!

71
00:07:49,623 --> 00:07:53,491
It's not enough with the break up. You even burned the house

72
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:59,521
That's because of you. Hug me. I was
so scared, I almost peed in my pants

73
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:02,636
Get off, I'm very tired

74
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:03,731
What's with you?

75
00:08:05,539 --> 00:08:06,506
That person?

76
00:08:11,645 --> 00:08:15,479
We are... unhappy people

77
00:08:15,516 --> 00:08:17,507
We're this messed up. Let's drink, OK?

78
00:08:19,586 --> 00:08:21,679
Call

79
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:28,550
Don't be alerted. 'To mess' up is
Choi Sol Woo's favorite proverb

80
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:32,656
To pick up the burden together, that way can increase the satisfaction

81
00:08:33,567 --> 00:08:35,467
By the way, it means 'to have drinks together'

82
00:08:43,644 --> 00:08:47,444
Welcome.
. Min Ah . Hello

83
00:08:48,549 --> 00:08:49,481
JM?

84
00:08:49,683 --> 00:08:52,709
There's a new dance bar
nearby. He's been going there these days

85
00:08:53,454 --> 00:08:55,513
Dance bar? You should be going together

86
00:08:55,689 --> 00:09:00,592
Bring him here, oppa.
He always sees me as a child

87
00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:04,554
But, is there a problem with Hyun Woo?

88
00:09:20,514 --> 00:09:26,419
Hurts? I'm hurt too. Feels
painful deep here, hurts so much

89
00:09:26,553 --> 00:09:27,451
Need a hand?

90
00:09:28,722 --> 00:09:35,423
I admit, I love that man.
I really want to have him

91
00:09:36,563 --> 00:09:42,502
I want to introduce him to everyone,
I want to hold hands with him on the street

92
00:09:42,603 --> 00:09:45,470
I want to do what
normal people do

93
00:09:45,506 --> 00:09:49,636
Normal? Isn't he
married now? This is a heartbreaking love

94
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,701
Let's laugh off our dying feelings

95
00:09:52,479 --> 00:09:58,509
A person who's going to confess, burned a house instead.
Other person plays a sad teary drama

96
00:09:58,619 --> 00:10:02,578
Turned into a total chaos<i>l</i> Enough. Let's just drink

97
00:10:03,524 --> 00:10:05,685
Why? Do you want me to get kicked off?

98
00:10:09,429 --> 00:10:12,557
If you dare to do it, you're dead!<i>l</i> No, I won't dare

99
00:10:13,567 --> 00:10:17,526
It's because of this, she
breaks up with you. So sensitive

100
00:10:20,707 --> 00:10:27,704
Thanks. Even if it's hard to believe,
it's the truth. I don't have the right to lie

101
00:10:28,482 --> 00:10:31,576
With only one word, I've became so sensitive

102
00:10:32,586 --> 00:10:36,647
It's too much...<i>l</i> It's better with more drinks.
My feeling's in this state, can't I drink?

103
00:10:36,723 --> 00:10:38,452
I'll drink alone

104
00:10:38,725 --> 00:10:42,559
Cut it a little! Is it not hot?

105
00:10:42,663 --> 00:10:52,629
I really ... look! Today, my feeling's
great. I'm a mess. Don't even know what a love is

106
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:58,473
Why are you doing this to me?
Am I not clear enough?

107
00:11:09,723 --> 00:11:11,691
Let's call noona.<i>l</i> So sleepy

108
00:11:17,598 --> 00:11:21,659
That temper and her violence,
Uncontrollable desire for drinks

109
00:11:22,603 --> 00:11:25,629
That's my partner Kim Hyun Woo

110
00:11:34,648 --> 00:11:39,551
I don't think you're hurt because
of love, but you're not loved, that's why you're upset

111
00:11:39,686 --> 00:11:42,450
Shut up, jerk!<i>l</i> My ear!

112
00:11:48,462 --> 00:11:49,656
What do you want? Whom you'll call?

113
00:11:51,465 --> 00:11:56,493
I miss him.<i>l</i> Don't!
Don't! Why you... this girl!

114
00:11:57,537 --> 00:12:01,598
Hi... It's me

115
00:12:02,609 --> 00:12:09,447
I'm drinking with a guy. On
his back right now

116
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:15,715
He's carrying me right now. You're okay with that?

117
00:12:16,523 --> 00:12:18,616
Silence, people might hear you. What should I say?

118
00:12:22,696 --> 00:12:25,494
Hi, I'm the guy

119
00:12:25,632 --> 00:12:28,465
Break up?

120
00:12:34,474 --> 00:12:36,567
Today, I broke up with my girlfriend too

121
00:12:38,578 --> 00:12:44,608
Jerk! I don't
care! Walk faster.<i>l</i> Ugh!

122
00:12:48,522 --> 00:12:50,490
My back! It hurts so much...

123
00:13:05,539 --> 00:13:07,507
Kang Joon Soo!

124
00:13:56,723 --> 00:13:58,623
What happened?

125
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,652
Why did I sleep in the living room?<i>I</i>
It was you who pull the blanket and slept there yourself

126
00:14:04,531 --> 00:14:05,623
Ugh, my stomach

127
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:11,569
12 glasses of wine, 15 glasses of alcohol,
plus 8 bottles of beer<i>l</i> Is she even human?

128
00:14:12,439 --> 00:14:13,463
Amazing

129
00:14:14,441 --> 00:14:18,707
That's why children have to be watched over. Hyun Woo,
if it's like this, you may keep us informed

130
00:14:19,513 --> 00:14:23,609
Drinks until you're drunk in work days. You sleep three
times a week here. Why do you even going out for anything

131
00:14:24,451 --> 00:14:29,650
I've been working hard. To freely live
before marriage.<i>l</i> Amazing

132
00:14:29,723 --> 00:14:32,590
Unni, when is your life not free?

133
00:14:32,659 --> 00:14:38,598
Silence, little girl.<i>l</i> Cin Yi, listen
well. Nowadays, even women also need to drink sometimes

134
00:14:38,732 --> 00:14:43,465
Have to speak up lots about dating,
even you're crying you live free

135
00:14:43,503 --> 00:14:46,472
Yes, If only there's no husband

136
00:14:48,508 --> 00:14:55,641
I think, you works in a TV station,
met Joon Soo and married him. That's right, father

137
00:14:56,483 --> 00:14:57,643
I'm not interested, uncle.

138
00:14:58,452 --> 00:15:01,717
We're not even alike, ever.<i>l</i> Two
bums that aren't completely the same

139
00:15:02,456 --> 00:15:07,450
One's a bum, other one is even bigger bum.<i>l</i>
Who's the bigger bum?<i>l</i> Stop it

140
00:15:08,595 --> 00:15:10,460
Why does my cheek hurts?

141
00:15:10,564 --> 00:15:12,555
I stepped on you. Went to the bathroom this morning

142
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:19,469
After you're awake, I think
you call someone.<i>l</i> Answer please

143
00:15:19,706 --> 00:15:24,473
Why don't you anwer the phone? You're too much

144
00:15:25,612 --> 00:15:26,636
I called?

145
00:15:29,449 --> 00:15:32,509
Where's my phone?

146
00:15:43,697 --> 00:15:46,530
I'm right. A big bum

147
00:15:48,568 --> 00:15:50,502
Why didn't you stop me?

148
00:15:51,538 --> 00:15:52,630
The soup is tasty, father

149
00:15:53,673 --> 00:15:55,470
Today, the soup's delicious

150
00:15:55,542 --> 00:15:57,669
That man and I, our relationship isn't that way.
We're serious

151
00:15:57,711 --> 00:16:00,578
. We... that man
is a stranger

152
00:16:00,647 --> 00:16:02,706
That man shouldn't coming here that freely

153
00:16:03,517 --> 00:16:07,510
Is that so! If you can't speak
nicely, I'll tear that mouth

154
00:16:08,588 --> 00:16:14,527
Alright, that man... had he ever been here?
Everyday, I clean the floor here

155
00:16:14,561 --> 00:16:18,395
He's never been here. Also,
this is my house, not yours

156
00:16:18,498 --> 00:16:21,467
It's also partly mine. When
moving out, I was the one that do it all

157
00:16:22,502 --> 00:16:24,561
All right, Mom. I get it

158
00:16:26,439 --> 00:16:28,532
It's really my mom now

159
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:31,506
Hi.<i>l</i> Good morning, mother<i>l</i> Morning, Joon Soo

160
00:16:34,714 --> 00:16:39,515
Today will be rainy,
about 10%, I might do laundry today

161
00:16:39,553 --> 00:16:43,683
The temperature also a bit high, 50F. Can't dry them
all today

162
00:16:44,591 --> 00:16:48,687
If it was me, I won't do the laundry today. Okay, bye

163
00:16:58,705 --> 00:17:02,505
Do you want to continue on this suffering?

164
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:09,414
As of now, we can't see each other anymore.
I know that, too

165
00:17:10,517 --> 00:17:12,542
But, you know how thoughtful I am

166
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:16,555
You have an interesting behaviour.
Just like a man.<i>l</i> Like a man

167
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:22,560
People like you easily attract others. You can drink
to relieve yourself. But, that's not for long

168
00:17:22,696 --> 00:17:26,564
Because men, in the end, will only
like a real woman

169
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:30,431
Have you ever see a man likes another man?<i>l</i> Jerk

170
00:17:34,441 --> 00:17:38,502
Have you ever see a man this
good looking? Have you, huh?

171
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:47,577
Even just to protect you, I can't. We're
walking about here, to avoid going across people we know

172
00:17:47,721 --> 00:17:50,588
Wear a pair of sunglasses

173
00:17:50,657 --> 00:17:54,684
But, why is it that you always have break up everytime?
Are you a rabbit?

174
00:17:55,562 --> 00:18:01,592
I am a turtle, ok? And I think,
if a woman falls in love,

175
00:18:01,701 --> 00:18:05,535
doesn't always has a definite time nor
duration.<i>l</i> Oh right, a rabbit

176
00:18:11,578 --> 00:18:16,481
Even though I'm not that great a man,
I am quite a good man.<i>l</i> Man?

177
00:18:17,517 --> 00:18:21,419
Physically, you are a man. But...

178
00:18:24,624 --> 00:18:29,391
Is it going to rain, today?<i>l</i>
Rain? I don't think so

179
00:18:29,562 --> 00:18:33,692
Let's shake hands.<i>l</i> We just want to
relax on our free time<i>l</i> Shake hands, ok!

180
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:53,681
My temper, attentive, and thorough self is like this

181
00:18:54,487 --> 00:19:01,484
You're just a petty person.<i>l</i> There's a good spirit,
and there are rules.<i>l</i> You mean, dull

182
00:19:01,695 --> 00:19:04,425
Just being nice, at this rate

183
00:19:05,732 --> 00:19:12,570
It's because you don't feel your attraction
affected. You're a man, but you can't drink

184
00:19:12,706 --> 00:19:15,539
What then? What is a true man?

185
00:19:15,675 --> 00:19:22,478
There are two kinds of man: one that have money,
or one that's handsome, for now only those two

186
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:24,439
And then?

187
00:19:29,489 --> 00:19:36,418
Push her straight against the wall. If not,
keep it along until the end

188
00:19:39,699 --> 00:19:41,633
Why am I so turned on?

189
00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:51,670
Can't you work well? If you
flirt on him, I'll break your legs

190
00:19:52,479 --> 00:19:55,448
If you dare to get close to him,
you know what'll happen? You're dead!

191
00:20:00,653 --> 00:20:03,520
Oppa.<i>l</i> I'm back

192
00:20:05,658 --> 00:20:08,627
Did you play with those people again
at the dance bar? Just break up

193
00:20:08,628 --> 00:20:11,597
with that girl.<i>l</i> For me,
what will you take off?

194
00:20:11,664 --> 00:20:15,532
This?<i>l</i> I want to be a naughty one, too

195
00:20:15,702 --> 00:20:17,727
Someday, I can get out of troubles too

196
00:20:26,446 --> 00:20:28,471
My dear, why have you become this pretty?

197
00:20:28,581 --> 00:20:32,642
Oppa, do you think I'm pretty?
I'm not pretty

198
00:20:33,453 --> 00:20:37,514
Can I...?<i>l</i> There's fruit fragrance on your body

199
00:20:44,431 --> 00:20:46,456
Oppa

200
00:20:46,533 --> 00:20:51,470
I really want to do it, but I hold
myself. I want to keep us until the end

201
00:20:51,671 --> 00:20:56,574
I've been waiting for you forever.<i>l</i> Min A

202
00:20:59,612 --> 00:21:01,580
You guys really don't have the intention to do business

203
00:21:02,582 --> 00:21:07,713
You eat pig feet, customers also order pig feet.
But, there's no pig feet in menu

204
00:21:08,521 --> 00:21:09,647
If we have no customer, I'm finished

205
00:21:09,722 --> 00:21:13,681
Joon Soo, we have agreed
not to talk about love from this day on

206
00:21:14,461 --> 00:21:18,420
We decided to drink everyday.<i>l</i>
Just drink at the pig feet restaurant

207
00:21:18,565 --> 00:21:24,561
Yes, from now only discuss worthy things.
Politics, economics, philosophy, environtment

208
00:21:24,704 --> 00:21:29,641
Anything else? Wars, Religions. Things such as these,
that we put aside instead

209
00:21:30,477 --> 00:21:34,675
For all these problems, which turn us
weaker.<i>l</i> Yes.<i>l</i> Drink

210
00:21:35,515 --> 00:21:39,474
Drink.<i>l</i> Agreed.<i>l</i> As of today,
no such thing as love or things similar

211
00:21:39,552 --> 00:21:43,511
Ok, drink up. Someday, we will have
a more dignified life

212
00:21:43,623 --> 00:21:45,523
No, there isn't

213
00:22:15,722 --> 00:22:20,659
As we've said before. The topic right now is
''Mad Travelling Phone''. I'd like to hear everyone's idea...

214
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:52,715
Women are hard to understand

215
00:22:53,693 --> 00:22:58,653
Have you seen this? It's terrible.
He wanted to give his best, things turned out this way

216
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:03,501
But, how are you today? Another break up?

217
00:23:04,537 --> 00:23:08,564
Isn't it the fourth this time?<i>l</i>
It's the third and it was me who break up with her

218
00:23:13,513 --> 00:23:15,708
Hello.<i>l</i> Kang Joon Soo.<i>l</i> Who's this?<i>l</i>
It hasn't been that long, but you've already forgot me

219
00:23:16,482 --> 00:23:18,575
I'm Andrew

220
00:23:19,485 --> 00:23:23,649
Ah, how are you?<i>l</i> We haven't been in contact for quite some time..

221
00:23:24,457 --> 00:23:29,656
But, how do you know my number?<i>l</i>
Things were quite complicated for for that. Kang Joon Soo..

222
00:23:30,463 --> 00:23:35,662
When you're at the army, they said you know
Kim Hyun Woo? Do you remember? Now, I got in a position

223
00:23:36,502 --> 00:23:37,594
I study abroad

224
00:23:37,704 --> 00:23:42,641
Hello, team leader...

225
00:23:43,643 --> 00:23:51,414
Today, rain will fall on central area.
From the afernoon, and next is Seoul...
ea pusat akan turun hujan lebat.
Siang dan seterusnya, Seoul pertama kali...

226
00:23:56,656 --> 00:23:57,714
My work's done

227
00:24:10,503 --> 00:24:11,697
Your voice's too loud, jerk

228
00:24:12,639 --> 00:24:15,574
I'll wait for you at the pig feet restaurant, see you there

229
00:24:15,742 --> 00:24:18,575
I have a date<i>l</i> I don't have any

230
00:24:19,612 --> 00:24:21,477
Dinner

231
00:24:21,681 --> 00:24:25,549
I didn't need to know that. Why
is it you sound so awkward?<i>l</i> Why else?

232
00:24:26,452 --> 00:24:28,613
Because I'll have a dinner. We'll have some food another time, sorry

233
00:24:29,689 --> 00:24:34,592
Why are you like this?
Since when did you ever apologised?

234
00:24:35,728 --> 00:24:37,559
You'll have dinner with that man?

235
00:24:38,464 --> 00:24:41,592
What did you say?<i>l</i> I'll get you

236
00:24:41,734 --> 00:24:47,468
Hello, I can't hear you clearly<i>l</i> I just used this one trick..

237
00:24:49,442 --> 00:24:51,672
Ugh! She's still playing acts like this..

238
00:24:52,512 --> 00:24:53,672
Oppa, let's just go home

239
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:59,577
Soon Yoon, why didn't you
just accept those flowers?

240
00:24:59,686 --> 00:25:03,520
If I just accept these...<i>l</i> What? ?

241
00:25:03,656 --> 00:25:05,624
Just to give him more time

242
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,552
What you've been thinking, oppa?

243
00:25:09,495 --> 00:25:12,487
I really don't understand women's heart.
Hyun Woo said,

244
00:25:12,532 --> 00:25:15,524
Man is only either one of the two type
One of the type is

245
00:25:15,735 --> 00:25:20,468
Directly push her againts the wall. Else,
he'll just stays there until the end

246
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:26,445
What do you say?<i>l</i> Oppa, Hyun Woo
is a family. Isn't it this simple?

247
00:25:27,447 --> 00:25:29,540
It's not like that

248
00:25:29,649 --> 00:25:34,416
You can just boldly get close to her.
It's up to you

249
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:38,481
Things might get unexpected.
Girls like that

250
00:25:38,691 --> 00:25:42,684
They might even get excited
from that.<i>l</i> Excitement...

251
00:25:47,667 --> 00:25:51,603
That Hyun Woo, she said that she doesn't need love,
it hasn't even last one day...<i>l</i> That's why don't believe a woman

252
00:25:52,438 --> 00:25:54,463
That's women

253
00:25:54,574 --> 00:25:56,701
Look at their body

254
00:25:58,544 --> 00:26:01,570
What?<i>l</i> I've just started
a serious relationship with her yesterday

255
00:26:16,596 --> 00:26:18,496
You're new here?

256
00:26:21,467 --> 00:26:24,527
Excuse me. Yes, Boss

257
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:29,667
Get back here quick, we have many customers today.<i>l</i> I'm having
business meeting with a client now.<i>l</i> I'll follow you there, then

258
00:26:32,545 --> 00:26:33,569
I'll be back

259
00:26:36,649 --> 00:26:39,482
I'll going back first, then

260
00:26:51,464 --> 00:26:52,431
Where are you looking at?

261
00:26:53,666 --> 00:26:57,466
I didn't look at your breasts.<i>l</i>
Is that so, why won't you look?

262
00:26:57,603 --> 00:27:00,595
Look?<i>l</i> I don't like to be looked at

263
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,670
That's why I don't look at you.<i>l</i> What's with you?

264
00:27:04,544 --> 00:27:08,605
If they aren't looked at, I feel
offended.<i>l</i> What should I do, then?

265
00:27:09,482 --> 00:27:13,418
Look at them secretly<i>l</i> Secretly?

266
00:27:17,423 --> 00:27:19,448
What are you doing?<i>l</i> Secretly looking

267
00:27:19,592 --> 00:27:21,651
Not that. What do you do for life, your job

268
00:27:22,495 --> 00:27:26,625
I teach children. An elementary school
teacher.<i>l</i> Really? Elementary teacher?

269
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,502
I'm interested in that profession.<i>l</i> Oh, is that so?

270
00:27:31,604 --> 00:27:33,469
Do you have a girlfriend?

271
00:27:36,542 --> 00:27:40,638
Did something happened?<i>l</i> I've break up with her

272
00:27:41,447 --> 00:27:44,575
Why?<i>l</i> I don't know.
That's what she wanted, eq23121

273
00:27:44,717 --> 00:27:50,622
Then, you'd fulfill a woman's
request?<i>l</i> Of course, she's my woman

274
00:27:53,659 --> 00:27:55,490
Can you drink it all?

275
00:28:10,576 --> 00:28:11,565
Feel's very nice

276
00:28:13,512 --> 00:28:17,505
Let's go have a walk.<i>l</i> We'd get bitten by mosquitos

277
00:28:18,718 --> 00:28:23,451
Let's bring along some kimbap tomorrow.
If we go to Chang Do Park,

278
00:28:23,456 --> 00:28:27,483
the flowers there should've been blossomed by then,
holding our hands there..

279
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,586
Doesn't you have mirrors
in your house, haven't you used them?

280
00:28:30,696 --> 00:28:34,496
Why is that?<i>l</i> Aren't you a flower yourself?

281
00:28:48,447 --> 00:28:54,545
I really like this scent. Calm, a little
arousing, and even more if I close my eyes

282
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:57,680
It is calming. Is it that good?

283
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:04,596
Don't you know, not everything I would do,
even for you

284
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:12,435
Aren't I good enough? Right here with you

285
00:30:16,669 --> 00:30:18,500
How was I there?

286
00:30:19,472 --> 00:30:20,461
Want to date me?

287
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:26,705
I'm a pretty good woman. 4th year
university student, an OK age, beautiful face. Lively

288
00:30:27,546 --> 00:30:29,446
and, I won't hold you down

289
00:30:30,483 --> 00:30:32,576
That's all I have to say, want another glass?

290
00:30:34,553 --> 00:30:43,518
What's this? It's the first time I felt such strong
feelings. A girl like this can only be in a movie

291
00:30:47,433 --> 00:30:49,663
What's wrong? Sit down, hurry

292
00:30:57,543 --> 00:30:59,670
What is all this about?

293
00:31:01,647 --> 00:31:06,516
Isn't it sexy? Both of you are
alike.<i>l</i> With a wallet? What's our common likeness?

294
00:31:06,619 --> 00:31:11,488
A bit silly, but there's a hidden courage

295
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:16,593
So, if we say it with weather forecaster
way... The silent before the storm

296
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:19,664
I like that

297
00:31:19,732 --> 00:31:26,570
Godsend.<i>l</i> The gift.<i>l</i> Career. Have to carefully
holding on to the innocent Hyun Woo...<i>l</i> Career?

298
00:31:28,741 --> 00:31:35,579
You're like a shrimp, reaching out your hands,
wandering off to look for the scent you're looking for

299
00:31:43,589 --> 00:31:45,648
Take the call. Or, you'd be worried

300
00:31:51,664 --> 00:31:57,466
Hello... outside... no

301
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,600
What is it?

302
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,579
It's , that's.. elevator

303
00:32:21,527 --> 00:32:25,486
I've ruin our date. It it alright?

304
00:32:26,732 --> 00:32:30,463
Don't worry. Just hurry home

305
00:32:36,675 --> 00:32:40,406
I might not come back.
Call your friend to pick you up

306
00:32:41,547 --> 00:32:46,541
Just go.<i>l</i> OK. Take care

307
00:33:05,738 --> 00:33:12,644
Hyung, do I have to help with the interview? She isn't
new in the field, she has some experience. J

308
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:17,606
OK, I'm going

309
00:33:32,698 --> 00:33:36,532
Where are you looking at? Are you a pervert?

310
00:33:39,538 --> 00:33:41,631
Your stocking's torn.<i>l</i> What?

311
00:33:44,577 --> 00:33:47,444
What should I do now?

312
00:33:52,551 --> 00:33:57,614
Since my father died, I've lived
with my mother in Jeju island

313
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:03,587
We then lived in Seoul and I went to elementary school there.
My mother grows and sells oranges in Jeju island

314
00:34:03,629 --> 00:34:09,431
That's why she likes to watch
weather forecast shows

315
00:34:09,501 --> 00:34:19,570
For her, such show is really important, since it correlates with
her works on the field. And, I just wanted to say to her that I'm fine

316
00:34:19,645 --> 00:34:25,641
Why don't you just go back to your mother
and grows fruits?<i>l</i> I too have that thought

317
00:34:26,452 --> 00:34:33,551
But, my mother said that growing oranges
doesn't requires you to have a pretty face and a lovely voice

318
00:34:36,528 --> 00:34:44,458
This time, we really get ourselves a treasure indeed.
Her face and her body, both are excellent.

319
00:34:46,505 --> 00:34:49,668
Here, let's have a toast, PD Lee

320
00:34:54,613 --> 00:35:01,485
Mr.PD Lee...<i>l</i> If you're like this, Kim HYun Woo
won't feel comfortable. Hyun Woo, are you feeling uncomfortable now?

321
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:07,681
No, it's alright.<i>l</i> With you here
it is I who feel uncomfortable

322
00:35:09,528 --> 00:35:11,689
Please go out.<i>l</i> Yes?<i>l</i> You can go out first

323
00:35:14,433 --> 00:35:16,697
If you're like this, what about
me?<i>l</i> You think only about yourself,

324
00:35:16,735 --> 00:35:19,704
Is Ms Hyun Woo's feeling
unimportant?<i>l</i> Why, do you like her?

325
00:35:22,508 --> 00:35:24,476
Please stop this

326
00:35:25,477 --> 00:35:30,574
The most important thing in making a weather forecast
is speed and accuracy

327
00:35:30,649 --> 00:35:36,645
Deliver it with a sincere feeling
Not with your face, but with your heart

328
00:35:39,558 --> 00:35:40,684
Heart

329
00:35:53,572 --> 00:35:58,441
More of that. Wait..Doest it hurts? Give out more...

330
00:36:03,682 --> 00:36:08,676
More.. breathe deeper,
let it out, let it out more

331
00:36:09,521 --> 00:36:12,684
Breathe, once more

332
00:36:16,495 --> 00:36:21,558
Oppa, I've calmed down now.<i>l</i> Oh right, that's the best

333
00:36:21,633 --> 00:36:25,694
Let's just sleep for now. You'd think over about it later, OK?

334
00:36:26,505 --> 00:36:29,668
I guess so. Even that we
met in a bar, I don't want to

335
00:36:29,708 --> 00:36:33,610
look down on you. Do you know what I mean?
You don't?

336
00:36:43,589 --> 00:36:45,580
Pick up the phone!

337
00:37:03,509 --> 00:37:07,639
You really are a gentleman. I'm so impressed

338
00:37:09,515 --> 00:37:12,484
Looked at me, but not getting into other motives,
you are the first.<i>l</i> Am I?

339
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:16,688
Can you help me out some
other times?<i>l</i> Next time,

340
00:37:17,423 --> 00:37:18,412
I'll go off first

341
00:37:24,696 --> 00:37:26,493
Bye. See you later.<i>l</i> Yes

342
00:38:04,536 --> 00:38:08,495
Hyun Woo, wake up, Hyun Woo.
Don't sleep here, let's go home

343
00:38:12,678 --> 00:38:16,444
Where have you been? Why just get here now?

344
00:38:17,683 --> 00:38:20,584
You've drunk again. Come, clean this up, and go home

345
00:38:20,652 --> 00:38:27,683
I'm not drunk. I'm the Weather Goddess
Kim Hyun Woo. I don't want to go home

346
00:38:32,531 --> 00:38:36,467
I want to drink all of this, then I'll go home

347
00:38:36,535 --> 00:38:41,598
When else can I even drink this all?
OK, let's bring this home and drink more

348
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:49,675
A glass. Please, teacher, just one glass.<i>l</i> Give it to me

349
00:39:10,702 --> 00:39:14,433
OK? Let's go

350
00:39:33,592 --> 00:39:35,617
Kang Joon Soo, hurry up

351
00:39:35,694 --> 00:39:41,496
I've said don't come to this place. You know that
I don't like this place.<i>l</i> It's good then

352
00:39:42,634 --> 00:39:45,660
So refreshing.<i>l</i> It's cold

353
00:39:47,506 --> 00:39:49,633
Hurry, faster.<i>l</i> Alright

354
00:39:54,646 --> 00:40:00,448
Looking at the mirror?<i>l</i> Why is that
each of his words are so poetics?

355
00:40:00,552 --> 00:40:04,613
I want to take notes of Mr. Lee Dong Jin's
words.<i>l</i> What's that? Don't speak such nonsense

356
00:40:05,524 --> 00:40:10,461
Are you this stupid? What he meant was
if you're looking at

357
00:40:10,495 --> 00:40:15,432
the other side, your real self is then reflected.
I've told you we're better be at home today

358
00:40:20,706 --> 00:40:22,640
Hurry!

359
00:40:25,544 --> 00:40:26,670
Together with me!

360
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:40,650
You were quite cool yesterday. I give this
for you, today.<i>l</i> Why?

361
00:40:41,593 --> 00:40:43,618
You picked me up yesterday

362
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:49,660
A tasty fish... I grilled one yesterday,
didn't sleep all night. Be grateful for me

363
00:40:49,735 --> 00:40:53,535
Yes, the ahjumma must've tired herself off.
Her place you often come to

364
00:40:53,639 --> 00:41:01,569
Even if it's like this, you still don't understand. Even
if you know, just pretend you don't, OK?

365
00:41:03,448 --> 00:41:05,643
Why are you eating the fried shrimp snack?
You said you don't want to eat?

366
00:41:08,487 --> 00:41:10,580
This tasty and delish flavor

367
00:41:17,429 --> 00:41:21,490
Want to ride on that boat.<i>l</i> Really? Do you?

368
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,533
Whom should I ride it with?

369
00:41:24,703 --> 00:41:27,672
With who? Me?<i>l</i> Get lost

370
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:39,440
We're now on third week of sixth month
This year, this night rain would move rapidly north

371
00:41:39,551 --> 00:41:43,510
The 30mm/hour rainfall is now upon Korea

372
00:41:43,555 --> 00:41:47,548
Early warnings had been delivered

373
00:41:47,659 --> 00:41:54,588
There's ice rain on several areas,
please be safe citizen

374
00:41:54,599 --> 00:42:01,528
Storms always come unpredictly,
don't let your guard down

375
00:42:01,707 --> 00:42:06,542
That's weather report of Kim Hyun Woo
<i>l</i> Didn't you know your underwear is visible?

376
00:42:06,712 --> 00:42:11,547
Do you think that news are like dramas?
I've already said that a report

377
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:15,680
have to be delivered with feeling.
Don't flirt on viewers<i>l</i> Sorry

378
00:42:16,722 --> 00:42:19,623
I think this is not bad<i>l</i> What should we do?

379
00:42:20,459 --> 00:42:27,456
An arousing imagination, really fresh.
The understandable weather report, also with good reactions

380
00:42:27,499 --> 00:42:28,625
Director, there's a weird comment

381
00:42:29,468 --> 00:42:31,561
Wait, what's this? Is it real?

382
00:42:34,473 --> 00:42:41,572
Nowadays, there's rumor Hyun Woo's been going to hotel
with a married man. It'll affect us

383
00:42:42,481 --> 00:42:46,645
If it's true, it'll be
a fatal blow for us. Her life might also be ruined

384
00:42:47,452 --> 00:42:50,421
Talk to her, ask what she has to say.<i>l</i> Alright

385
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:56,527
Hold on

386
00:42:58,597 --> 00:43:03,591
That was close.<i>l</i> Miss Goddess, today was great

387
00:43:04,469 --> 00:43:06,664
Our rating's increased.<i>l</i> Oh, is it really?

388
00:43:07,539 --> 00:43:14,502
I've only wear a casual uniform on the show,
but, apparently it arouse men's imagination

389
00:43:15,714 --> 00:43:17,545
Director, did you also..?

390
00:43:19,451 --> 00:43:22,614
Kim Hyun Woo, watch with what you say

391
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:45,433
Are you upset? jealous? Is it because you
think you've made a mistake, so this is it?
I've already forgot about it

392
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:47,473
I don't care with such things

393
00:43:47,546 --> 00:43:50,515
A few days ago, you called me sometime after midnight

394
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:54,475
That was...

395
00:43:55,720 --> 00:44:00,487
What are you waiting for?
Is your standard this low?

396
00:44:02,494 --> 00:44:07,431
Because of holidays, my family comes home
We want to take a vacation

397
00:44:07,465 --> 00:44:12,425
I wasn't aware of it before
We shouldn't be this way

398
00:44:13,605 --> 00:44:15,539
What do you mean?

399
00:44:16,641 --> 00:44:21,442
I still want to work longer with you in the future
Do you know what it means?

400
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:16,423
Feels so nice. Oppa, try this. Is it good?

401
00:45:28,513 --> 00:45:31,414
Let's go.<i>l</i> Let me go.<i>l</i> Let's go

402
00:45:31,549 --> 00:45:36,509
Who're you?<i>l</i> Get lost!

403
00:45:36,655 --> 00:45:41,490
I said, step aside.
Hee Jin's my woman!

404
00:45:43,528 --> 00:45:46,588
Honey, we're just had a little fight,
right?<i>l</i> What do you want?

405
00:45:46,631 --> 00:45:50,431
We've break up already!<i>l</i>
Let's have a talk there

406
00:45:59,644 --> 00:46:03,580
This time, it isn't 100 days,
not even 10 days

407
00:46:04,616 --> 00:46:08,677
This is uncommon for me.
But, why is it always with me

408
00:46:53,732 --> 00:46:55,529
Give me a drink

409
00:46:58,570 --> 00:47:01,539
Hyun Goddess..<i>l</i> Hyun unni

410
00:47:20,525 --> 00:47:22,493
What is it? Why don't you just take a bath<i>l</i> Towel

411
00:47:24,729 --> 00:47:28,563
Wipe the water off first, then sit down. Min A, bath robe

412
00:47:36,508 --> 00:47:40,638
It's tasteless.<i>l</i> Tae Joon, give me something else

413
00:47:40,712 --> 00:47:44,443
Would you drink it, then
I'd cut off your ears?<i>l</i> I..

414
00:47:44,449 --> 00:47:47,475
What's cut off ears?<i>l</i>
You cut your own ears?

415
00:47:47,619 --> 00:47:51,487
Who is it? A famous person?

416
00:47:54,526 --> 00:48:01,557
No one. Ho Kao?<i>l</i> Because it's
Hun Ku.<i>l</i> Bring it, hurry!

417
00:48:03,468 --> 00:48:07,632
From now on, I'd live
however I want. You'll

418
00:48:07,639 --> 00:48:12,508
introduce me with someone.
I'd flirt on with every Korean man
/Me too

419
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:15,474
Why don't you two date each other?
/Stop that

420
00:48:20,452 --> 00:48:22,477
Min A, just close the shop.<i>l</i> Alright

421
00:48:22,554 --> 00:48:27,457
We're not on a good mood today,
won't be good for business.<i>l</i> So nice of you

422
00:48:35,567 --> 00:48:39,526
Haven't you break up? Is it over?

423
00:48:41,639 --> 00:48:46,542
I don't want to. Then what would you do?
<i>l</i> I've no idea

424
00:48:48,546 --> 00:48:55,714
Look, isn't there a way? If the media
knows about it, you're done.<i>l</i> I know that too

425
00:48:57,589 --> 00:49:02,583
What is there you don't have? Goddes Kim Hyun Woo,
not some cheap lady.<i>l</i> Yes

426
00:49:04,529 --> 00:49:07,692
Is that man covered by gold, siver?<i>l</i> A golden light

427
00:49:09,634 --> 00:49:21,705
Although there's no golden light,
there's a bright ray

428
00:49:23,581 --> 00:49:30,714
I really don't understand that.<i>l</i>
I don't get it myself.

429
00:49:32,457 --> 00:49:42,458
But, that man is a true gentleman.<i>l</i>
Gentleman? He's not,

430
00:49:42,567 --> 00:49:46,560
He's a jerk. Aren't you looking for an ordinary man?

431
00:49:49,741 --> 00:49:54,508
Think about it, in your
love live now, there's no

432
00:49:54,546 --> 00:49:58,607
Kim Hyun Woo. You only
become the third person

433
00:50:01,452 --> 00:50:03,420
Don't cry

434
00:50:08,526 --> 00:50:10,551
How can you say that?

435
00:50:27,645 --> 00:50:31,706
Hyun Woo, sorry

436
00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:39,453
Today, I've made mistake. Might be
from all those cola i drank. I'm sorry

437
00:50:40,558 --> 00:50:44,494
Right now, Hyun Woo's in terrible
state, please turn up the volume

438
00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:48,597
Hyun Woo, really, I've made you cry

439
00:50:50,635 --> 00:50:53,661
I truly am, my mistakes to you

440
00:51:42,654 --> 00:51:49,560
So it true, the only man
who can make Hyun Woo laughs is me

441
00:51:49,661 --> 00:51:53,597
Hyun Woo, what about me?
Am I really not your type?

442
00:51:53,731 --> 00:52:00,466
Surely isn't.<i>l</i> Until now,
you don't see me as a man?

443
00:52:01,673 --> 00:52:11,412
It's true, 18 years. You've might already know
Since 18 years ago I've already loved Hyun Woo

444
00:52:20,491 --> 00:52:23,460
Kim Hyun Woo, who came from Jeju island,

445
00:52:23,494 --> 00:52:26,463
Our first meeting was really shocking.
<i>l</i> It's your room

446
00:52:30,535 --> 00:52:33,470
Where's your room?<i>l</i> Right here

447
00:52:34,572 --> 00:52:37,541
I want this room. Go!

448
00:52:41,679 --> 00:52:44,443
Kang Joon Soo, hurry!<i>l</i> Let's go together

449
00:52:48,553 --> 00:52:51,613
Hurry up, you turtle.<i>l</i> Come on

450
00:52:51,656 --> 00:52:54,648
Kim Hyun Woo, be my
girlfriend.<i>l</i> Accept him, accept him

451
00:52:57,628 --> 00:53:00,529
Wait, I have to make sure first

452
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:14,703
I don't feel a strong heart beat from you
Well then, where'd we go tomorrow?

453
00:53:15,513 --> 00:53:23,511
I want a boyfriend first to go there together
A special one to get along. Do you get it?

454
00:53:25,523 --> 00:53:28,583
Hyun Woo, you have to keep your promise

455
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:55,715
Kid, hey..<i>l</i> Since then, I have the acrophobia

456
00:53:57,688 --> 00:54:02,523
Hyun Woo, I went there with you,
then date me

457
00:54:02,693 --> 00:54:06,686
Also, at the time I didn't pee in my pants,
It's just the uncle next to me

458
00:54:06,731 --> 00:54:10,724
Some of his drink spilled over me
I really like you

459
00:54:12,570 --> 00:54:13,662
Go away!

460
00:54:15,606 --> 00:54:19,702
Hyun Woo said, family-related people
cannot date each other

461
00:54:43,501 --> 00:54:48,438
I'm sorry, Oppa. To me, you're not a man

462
00:54:48,606 --> 00:54:51,541
Right here, there's no feeling of you

463
00:54:52,677 --> 00:54:55,544
Can't feel the desire for you

464
00:55:12,730 --> 00:55:15,631
Your heart? I'm going to move your heart

465
00:55:17,435 --> 00:55:20,427
After this drink, we're going to date.<i>l</i>
What did you say?

466
00:55:28,713 --> 00:55:30,476
Let's do this

467
00:56:48,459 --> 00:56:55,524
After 18 years, there's never had
a dream this good

468
00:57:39,543 --> 00:57:42,535
Joon Soo! Come eat

469
00:57:51,656 --> 00:57:53,715
Why is the memory from yesterday I be this clear

470
00:58:08,472 --> 00:58:09,666
Good morning

471
00:58:13,711 --> 00:58:14,643
Why are you here?

472
00:58:15,446 --> 00:58:20,440
Oh my, did they sleep together?<i>l</i> No.<i>l</i> It's not that

473
00:58:20,518 --> 00:58:24,511
Hyun Woo must've forget it...<i>l</i>
I don't know what I did

474
00:58:26,557 --> 00:58:30,459
Thank you, father. mother.<i>l</i> What? Father?

475
00:58:30,561 --> 00:58:37,467
Are you crazy?<i>l</i> We've decided to
date.<i>l</i> Great

476
00:58:37,568 --> 00:58:41,470
Water.<i>l</i> Here's some water, dear

477
00:58:43,741 --> 00:58:46,471
Drink up

478
00:58:50,448 --> 00:58:54,544
After 18 years, how's your feeling
first kiss with me?<i>l</i> Feeling?

479
00:58:54,719 --> 00:59:00,419
Happy? I haven't feel my heart beats
to be strong, passionate ones

480
00:59:03,461 --> 00:59:05,520
Me neither

481
00:59:08,666 --> 00:59:13,626
When I called you 'honey', did
you that surprised? afraid that I'll hold you down?

482
00:59:15,673 --> 00:59:20,633
I'm fine. Don't you think too much.
I know you're not seeing me as a man

483
00:59:23,481 --> 00:59:26,575
Now, you'd break up with me?<i>l</i> Me?

484
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:40,625
And I didn't believe my heart at first.
Now, I follow my heart. This is how it ends, right?

485
00:59:42,466 --> 00:59:44,661
I won't ever fall in love anymore

486
00:59:49,507 --> 00:59:53,466
I'm late, I'll go ahead

487
00:59:58,482 --> 01:00:04,648
Is Hyun Woo serious? It's like
all never happened and just leave it all like that

488
01:00:10,494 --> 01:00:12,462
Excuse me, are you PD Lee?

489
01:00:12,663 --> 01:00:14,597
My name's Joon Soo

490
01:00:16,667 --> 01:00:20,501
Just sit down, it's alright.
I'll just stand here. She didn't know

491
01:00:20,538 --> 01:00:23,666
that I meet you here. She
sure is depressed because of you

492
01:00:24,542 --> 01:00:27,443
Surely, I shouldn't get in between
you, but I hope

493
01:00:28,445 --> 01:00:31,505
that you don't meet her anymore
/mr Joon Soo, I know what

494
01:00:31,515 --> 01:00:34,575
you want to say, but it's all
in the past for me

495
01:00:34,618 --> 01:00:38,577
To meet her or no, you shouldn't
get in between us

496
01:00:39,456 --> 01:00:41,583
We are...<i>l</i>Please, don't say ''we''

497
01:00:43,627 --> 01:00:46,687
I say once more, we are no longer
a pair of lover anymore

498
01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:50,496
She herself set her feelings
for that

499
01:00:51,468 --> 01:00:54,528
That's why, you should not come
see me, but

500
01:00:54,538 --> 01:00:57,598
see her/ Promise that you'll never
meet her anymore

501
01:00:58,509 --> 01:01:03,469
She has a very good friend/ Director...

502
01:01:06,450 --> 01:01:08,441
I beg you

503
01:01:08,719 --> 01:01:12,553
Please leave her alone, let her be happy

504
01:01:13,490 --> 01:01:18,689
So, please end this all
nicely. I beg you.

505
01:01:21,632 --> 01:01:23,463
Just go back.

506
01:02:23,527 --> 01:02:24,619
Put it a little more to the left, higher

507
01:02:25,462 --> 01:02:26,622
Left?<i>l</i>Stop. Very good

508
01:02:29,466 --> 01:02:35,598
You mustn't let some random guy in.
People might think you're an easy girl

509
01:02:36,507 --> 01:02:38,498
Then you should've better be
my mom/ That'd be good

510
01:02:38,609 --> 01:02:43,637
Another one of mom's wise teaching<i>l</i>Password is
0113<i>l</i>Why'd it use your birthday

511
01:02:44,715 --> 01:02:47,684
It's my house, it should've used
my own password<i>l</i>If,

512
01:02:47,685 --> 01:02:50,654
you get sick, who else would
take care of you but me?

513
01:02:51,588 --> 01:02:54,557
Why'd you bring these ugly pair of shoes here?

514
01:02:54,658 --> 01:02:57,559
The world's a dangerous place,
put it in front of the door

515
01:03:00,464 --> 01:03:03,524
It doesnt smell that bad

516
01:03:04,501 --> 01:03:12,431
Hurry, wash it<i>l</i>Sorry<i>l</i>Quickly,
put it there..then clean the toilet

517
01:03:14,545 --> 01:03:17,605
Do it well, alright

518
01:05:04,655 --> 01:05:09,524
Summer comes earlier this year

519
01:05:09,626 --> 01:05:15,531
This weather forecast is on eastern area.
Today's weather

520
01:05:15,566 --> 01:05:21,505
is 36 degrees.
Breaks the record in 8 years..

521
01:05:21,538 --> 01:05:25,474
Everyone must've hopes rain will fall

522
01:05:25,576 --> 01:05:31,481
Hopefully, tomorrow there'll be good news

523
01:05:37,488 --> 01:05:41,447
Do you think, a friend for 18 years
could be a girlfriend?

524
01:05:43,727 --> 01:05:46,525
Are you a gay?

525
01:05:46,663 --> 01:05:50,497
What?<i>l</i>Why didn't you say it from the start<i>l</i>What?

526
01:05:53,504 --> 01:06:00,637
Attention please. Sit down, please. She's
our new teacher, you may introduce yourself

527
01:06:00,711 --> 01:06:09,483
Good morning, everyone. My name is Hee Jin

528
01:06:09,653 --> 01:06:13,555
Seriously, working and dancing, why can't I do both?

529
01:06:15,559 --> 01:06:17,550
Why didn't you tell me first?

530
01:06:17,694 --> 01:06:22,688
I wanted to surprise you<i>l</i>
Why'd you always...<i>l</i>I've break up with him

531
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:28,563
Now, I'm here with you. It's friday,
do you want to have some fun?

532
01:07:04,675 --> 01:07:10,477
You shouldn't fall for that guy.
You might get hurt if you're with him

533
01:07:10,581 --> 01:07:13,550
You said it because you're lonely

534
01:07:13,617 --> 01:07:19,681
I like that type of guy.
I'd love to bring him home

535
01:07:20,457 --> 01:07:22,584
He's the worst of friends

536
01:07:25,429 --> 01:07:30,526
Today's a total mess. What
am I doing, really?

537
01:07:41,645 --> 01:07:45,445
It looks like he's shameless

538
01:07:45,515 --> 01:07:48,678
Why? Is it because I'm okay with it
and open-minded?

539
01:07:49,620 --> 01:07:51,611
This is a special, for you only

540
01:07:51,688 --> 01:07:56,557
Guys are so clueless. Instantly fall for women's appearance

541
01:07:56,727 --> 01:07:59,594
It doesn't means guys are illogical/Didn't you say

542
01:07:59,630 --> 01:08:02,497
that you don't feel anything?

543
01:08:06,470 --> 01:08:07,494
It's quite good

544
01:08:09,506 --> 01:08:16,571
Why suddenly gets this close, what's
with you?<i>l</i>Long time no see

545
01:08:17,648 --> 01:08:24,645
Ah, it's you. It's been so long. What are
you doing here?<i>l</i>I just passing by

546
01:08:28,525 --> 01:08:32,427
How're you now?<i>l</i>I'm a photographer

547
01:08:36,533 --> 01:08:41,470
Looks like you've made it<i>l</i>What is it?

548
01:08:41,505 --> 01:08:46,442
I'm just get started. I'm still
working hard for it

549
01:08:47,444 --> 01:08:49,469
You two are at same age?<i>l</i>I'm three years younger

550
01:08:49,546 --> 01:08:53,607
Then, I'm the older sister<i>l</i>I've
never called an older woman 'noona'

551
01:08:54,618 --> 01:08:57,587
That's...<i>l</i>What would you like to eat?
They have some tasty food here

552
01:08:58,488 --> 01:09:02,515
I was his senior at the military service. Hyo Bong...
No, Andrew always has his confidence

553
01:09:02,592 --> 01:09:07,495
And now, time for his mean speech

554
01:09:10,701 --> 01:09:12,464
Let's toast

555
01:09:18,508 --> 01:09:23,536
Hello. Sorry. I'll be right there

556
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:29,710
I just remembered, I still
have something to do. You two would
be alright without me, right?

557
01:09:31,588 --> 01:09:36,525
How can you forget?

558
01:09:38,528 --> 01:09:39,586
I'm sorry. I'll leave first

559
01:09:42,733 --> 01:09:45,600
Can you really go home by yourself?

560
01:09:49,506 --> 01:09:51,599
Have fun, I'm going now

561
01:09:54,711 --> 01:09:59,512
Again, I don't have no choice but leave<i>l</i>
Your orders,

562
01:10:06,556 --> 01:10:09,491
Do you know, what they call
a woman who can eat this much?

563
01:10:09,626 --> 01:10:13,460
I don't want to know.<i>l</i>''little pig''

564
01:10:18,635 --> 01:10:25,541
It might be better with side dished
than the rice. Might be good with a change of things

565
01:10:26,710 --> 01:10:30,646
He's also a good man

566
01:10:30,714 --> 01:10:34,480
Here we go...!

567
01:10:38,455 --> 01:10:40,548
Time for another trial

568
01:10:40,624 --> 01:10:46,460
Are you alright? Afraid of height? If
you can't do this, you're useless

569
01:10:46,563 --> 01:10:53,469
Come on... Don't look down there<i>l</i>
I don't want to look

570
01:10:53,570 --> 01:10:59,668
Get down there<i>l</i>I can't..<i>l</i>I'll fill
in his place, I'll do it two times

571
01:11:00,544 --> 01:11:03,445
Jump down<i>l</i>Ms.Hyun Woo!

572
01:11:09,653 --> 01:11:12,417
Eat this...

573
01:11:12,522 --> 01:11:15,514
He had been in love with her for a long time

574
01:11:22,499 --> 01:11:25,468
Ms Hyun Woo doen't want to accept any call<i>l</i>Why?

575
01:11:26,636 --> 01:11:29,469
We don't know the reason

576
01:11:58,635 --> 01:12:00,466
Let's drink coffee

577
01:12:01,605 --> 01:12:04,438
Apparently, you didn't ask others
first, before deciding

578
01:12:04,441 --> 01:12:06,568
We just met for the first time, but
you already full of confidence

579
01:12:07,477 --> 01:12:09,570
Isn't that good?

580
01:12:11,448 --> 01:12:16,511
I'll go ahead. Dinner was nice, thank you

581
01:12:21,458 --> 01:12:26,452
Still with the attitude.
Does it means, not to get closer to you?

582
01:12:28,498 --> 01:12:32,457
Look's like you understand that

583
01:12:33,470 --> 01:12:35,597
I don't like younger men. I

584
01:12:35,605 --> 01:12:38,438
have to understand their feelings,
I really don't like it

585
01:12:39,709 --> 01:12:44,703
Is that so. Then, let me the one who
take care of you

586
01:12:47,517 --> 01:12:48,643
I'll go ahead first

587
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:55,453
I too don't like olden women.
But, Ms Hyun Woo's an exception

588
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:14,670
This.. is me?<i>l</i>Yes, that's you

589
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:17,579
Do you really not remember it?

590
01:13:19,482 --> 01:13:21,541
At that time of your visit..

591
01:13:25,555 --> 01:13:32,518
Joon Soo's sweating, is it that hot?
You really are nice to Joon Soo, thank you

592
01:13:32,629 --> 01:13:35,598
After this military service,
let's share our numbers, so can you wait for me?

593
01:13:35,632 --> 01:13:39,466
You always go after me, so cute

594
01:13:40,537 --> 01:13:43,506
After my military service,
I became

595
01:13:43,506 --> 01:13:46,475
a street photographer. Taking pictures
on streets, seeing you sometimes

596
01:13:46,543 --> 01:13:48,534
just like a destiny

597
01:13:57,587 --> 01:14:00,579
That picture got a reward

598
01:14:03,593 --> 01:14:05,561
This is a harrassment for sure

599
01:14:05,629 --> 01:14:08,564
It's not that. This is..<i>l</i>Is it allowed?

600
01:14:08,632 --> 01:14:12,659
shows someone's heart

601
01:14:13,603 --> 01:14:14,570
and gets a reward

602
01:14:15,605 --> 01:14:18,403
Teacher, can you tell us your first love?

603
01:14:18,608 --> 01:14:19,506
First love?

604
01:14:22,479 --> 01:14:27,507
First love...!

605
01:14:27,684 --> 01:14:34,590
Love. The problem is to love
and be loved

606
01:14:34,691 --> 01:14:38,650
the point is, not to be loved
but to love someone. My

607
01:14:38,662 --> 01:14:42,621
first love, was when I'm
11, there's a girl

608
01:14:53,476 --> 01:15:00,507
Today, there'll be hotter temperature...

609
01:15:19,502 --> 01:15:20,594
Did you cook all this?

610
01:15:20,670 --> 01:15:23,537
Of course, I myself bought it all

611
01:15:24,674 --> 01:15:27,404
Thank you. Here I go

612
01:15:27,544 --> 01:15:29,603
Wait. Let's have a picture first

613
01:15:32,682 --> 01:15:37,676
Am I a woman who loves or a loved woman?

614
01:15:39,456 --> 01:15:45,691
What's her name?<i>l</i>Hyun Woo's...an old friend

615
01:15:46,496 --> 01:15:48,623
What? Is it a guy?

616
01:15:50,467 --> 01:15:51,525
Yes, it's a guy

617
01:15:54,637 --> 01:15:58,437
You cut your hair. So cute

618
01:16:07,484 --> 01:16:08,712
Look here

619
01:16:12,555 --> 01:16:16,548
You seems to understand women's heart.
You can even fix their hearts

620
01:16:18,428 --> 01:16:21,659
I don't really understands
women, only you

621
01:16:22,499 --> 01:16:26,492
Although, I don't completely
understand you, but...

622
01:16:28,505 --> 01:16:33,499
Surely, while you look tough outside,
you are soft inside

623
01:16:33,676 --> 01:16:41,481
Do you understands me?
Can you guess, what I'd want to eat?

624
01:16:45,688 --> 01:16:49,647
After an ice cream, what would you want for dinner?
Pig feet or tofu soup?

625
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:54,462
I'd like some pasta<i>l</i>Alright, let's have pig feet

626
01:16:55,465 --> 01:16:58,491
Try this<i>l</i>I don't eat pig feet

627
01:17:05,642 --> 01:17:10,579
Pervert! Why'd you go in woman's bath?
You really are a pervert!

628
01:17:10,713 --> 01:17:14,672
I'll get you to the police station,
so everyone knows that you are a pervert!

629
01:17:15,418 --> 01:17:18,581
Ahjumma, it's not like that<i>l</i>Shut up! How can you!

630
01:17:18,655 --> 01:17:24,491
This is a bar, not a bath/ What bar? Come here!

631
01:17:24,627 --> 01:17:27,425
No more picture, please

632
01:17:27,497 --> 01:17:29,556
Are you that surprised?

633
01:17:36,673 --> 01:17:38,436
Would you like to go to another place?

634
01:17:44,647 --> 01:17:49,607
It's the first time in my life, there's a woman
who likes me. But, why am I not happy?

635
01:17:49,719 --> 01:17:51,482
No.

636
01:17:52,522 --> 01:17:54,615
Why do you like me?

637
01:17:59,495 --> 01:18:03,488
You can understand people feeling
so well and nice for them

638
01:18:07,670 --> 01:18:10,571
Why?<i>l</i>Can you curse at people?

639
01:18:12,475 --> 01:18:15,535
Cursing people? When I'm upset
I often curses at people<i>l</i>Try to say it

640
01:18:16,446 --> 01:18:17,504
Dammit

641
01:18:18,681 --> 01:18:25,610
It's not like that.
You have to curse harsher. Try again

642
01:18:28,424 --> 01:18:29,584
Bastard

643
01:18:30,526 --> 01:18:34,462
It's not that. What would Hyun Woo say?

644
01:18:36,466 --> 01:18:38,593
Can you say it louder?

645
01:18:39,535 --> 01:18:44,632
Why, oppa? Why do I
have to be like Hyun Woo?

646
01:18:45,441 --> 01:18:47,534
No.. It's not like that<i>l</i>Forget it

647
01:18:49,445 --> 01:18:51,640
Hee Jin...!

648
01:18:54,584 --> 01:18:59,647
Let's just break up. Only Hyun Woo's in your heart

649
01:19:01,491 --> 01:19:06,519
I've tried, but it's failed

650
01:19:08,531 --> 01:19:09,555
Sorry

651
01:19:16,506 --> 01:19:19,475
I really feel sorry for her

652
01:19:21,644 --> 01:19:26,672
In this hot weather, it's hard to sleep
at night. It's even hot at night

653
01:19:27,517 --> 01:19:35,720
There won't be any
rain in few days

654
01:19:36,459 --> 01:19:43,524
In this weather, we should
look after our health more

655
01:20:07,657 --> 01:20:09,420
Where are you?

656
01:20:09,726 --> 01:20:13,457
I've just started to sleep, before you called

657
01:20:14,530 --> 01:20:17,658
Are you with him?

658
01:20:19,569 --> 01:20:25,474
He's quite funny, also smart

659
01:20:25,675 --> 01:20:29,702
What if I try to date him?<i>l</i>Are you looking for trouble?

660
01:20:30,580 --> 01:20:33,606
Is something wrong if I date him?<i>l</i>He doesn't suit you

661
01:20:34,450 --> 01:20:40,616
He's still too young,
really doesn't fit you at all

662
01:20:41,557 --> 01:20:44,424
Why is it that you know him that well,
but you still introduced him

663
01:20:44,427 --> 01:20:46,588
to me?<i>l</i>You were so troubled at the time

664
01:20:46,729 --> 01:20:49,459
I was just wanted you have a nice dinner
and chat with him, that's it

665
01:20:49,465 --> 01:20:51,490
I don't expect you two to date

666
01:20:53,503 --> 01:20:58,497
You're totally crazy, what is it that you really want?

667
01:20:58,674 --> 01:21:03,475
At that time, you even said to start fresh

668
01:21:03,613 --> 01:21:11,543
I think, you're still normal now.
Think this over calmly

669
01:21:12,555 --> 01:21:14,614
Things will get better,
everything's going to be alright

670
01:21:15,558 --> 01:21:20,689
Do you really want to die? Just take
some medicine if so. Don't go crazy around me

671
01:21:21,597 --> 01:21:24,691
Why'd you said that.. hello..

672
01:21:26,536 --> 01:21:28,527
She hang up, that woman

673
01:21:33,709 --> 01:21:35,677
What do you want to do today?

674
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:41,576
Do you know that flower's meaning?<i>l</i>What?<i>l</i>Just
look at me

675
01:21:47,457 --> 01:21:48,583
Hold on

676
01:21:49,725 --> 01:21:51,659
What are you doing? Isn't today hot?

677
01:21:53,463 --> 01:21:56,694
I'm feeling sick, just laying on bed right now
<i>l</i>Lay on bed?

678
01:21:58,734 --> 01:22:00,497
Can people do laundry today?

679
01:22:01,504 --> 01:22:04,598
Yes, of course<i>l</i>Alright

680
01:22:06,476 --> 01:22:07,534
Hello

681
01:22:16,452 --> 01:22:19,421
This is a nice bowling
place. Really nice

682
01:22:19,522 --> 01:22:22,457
I think I've got this/ Wait a minute.
You can continue on

683
01:22:26,462 --> 01:22:29,522
What is it?<i>l</i>Why is it so hot today?

684
01:22:29,699 --> 01:22:34,432
37 degrees/yes

685
01:22:41,711 --> 01:22:44,680
Anything else?<i>l</i>When there'll be rain?

686
01:22:45,648 --> 01:22:50,585
In a few days, the weather will get better/
ok/Don't call me anymore

687
01:22:52,455 --> 01:22:54,480
This guy, really..

688
01:23:02,498 --> 01:23:04,523
Honey, don't you want to look around the place?<i>l</i>What?

689
01:23:05,501 --> 01:23:10,461
I know... sorry. How's it, dear? Is it not good?<i>l</i>It's
delicious

690
01:23:10,706 --> 01:23:20,581
Is there any dessert?<i>l</i>To fuel the passionate
love, chocolate cake

691
01:23:20,616 --> 01:23:23,608
No. Give us green tea cookies

692
01:23:25,588 --> 01:23:29,490
Green tea<i>l</i>So boring

693
01:23:30,626 --> 01:23:32,651
I want green tea cookies

694
01:23:33,629 --> 01:23:36,496
Let's bet on who'd pay the bills

695
01:23:36,532 --> 01:23:38,625
Let's do it

696
01:23:40,436 --> 01:23:43,564
Think about it first

697
01:23:47,643 --> 01:23:49,543
Rock, Scissor, Paper!

698
01:23:50,446 --> 01:23:51,572
Do you already know you'd win?

699
01:23:51,614 --> 01:23:58,452
He can only drops paper. Sometimes I pretend
to lose to him. I'd win over him on important times

700
01:23:58,554 --> 01:24:01,546
At time like this, I envy him.
You even know this little detail

701
01:24:01,557 --> 01:24:04,549
You two are so close

702
01:24:11,434 --> 01:24:15,530
He still hasn't get in car.<i>l</i>He's not a little boy anymore

703
01:24:20,676 --> 01:24:23,645
Wait up..

704
01:24:33,623 --> 01:24:36,421
What happened, that you even drinks?

705
01:24:42,665 --> 01:24:49,696
What do you think of this?
How's my situation right now?

706
01:24:51,540 --> 01:24:56,477
From now on, let's not be like this to each other.
You always talks politely, I feel uncomfortable

707
01:24:56,545 --> 01:24:59,571
Is it? I feel more comfortable this way

708
01:24:59,715 --> 01:25:05,517
It makes me unable to get closer
to you, and he's always get in between us

709
01:25:06,489 --> 01:25:09,424
I think you even want him with us

710
01:25:09,659 --> 01:25:15,495
This isn't good for us, and
you're not that kind of person

711
01:25:26,542 --> 01:25:28,510
So, what kind of person am I?

712
01:25:32,648 --> 01:25:34,582
The number you're calling is inactive,
please leave a message after the tone..

713
01:25:41,457 --> 01:25:44,483
Am I really not a man?

714
01:25:44,727 --> 01:25:50,427
What do you think, should I get angry or not?
You can understand, can't you? I have to get upset, right?

715
01:25:50,599 --> 01:25:55,662
For 18 years, I'm behind her
this is crazy

716
01:25:56,539 --> 01:25:57,665
You just have to stand in front of her

717
01:26:02,578 --> 01:26:08,448
Yes, I also feel, I'm the one who matches her most

718
01:26:08,551 --> 01:26:13,579
It's like the unknown importance of air.
My presence is like the air for her

719
01:26:13,689 --> 01:26:16,681
It doesn't mean that men
must have physical contact to be known

720
01:26:16,726 --> 01:26:20,423
It's impossible to
touch her heart everyday

721
01:26:20,596 --> 01:26:22,427
I have to let her know immediately

722
01:26:27,636 --> 01:26:32,437
What's this? It's inactive...Her phone's inactive
why would it be inactive?

723
01:26:36,479 --> 01:26:38,640
Still like Hyun Woo I've known well

724
01:26:38,714 --> 01:26:42,616
Until now you still can't forget that man

725
01:26:42,718 --> 01:26:46,552
To have someone that's still unclear, neither
a friend nor a lover

726
01:26:46,689 --> 01:26:51,524
Two person who love each other
A strange relationship

727
01:26:51,627 --> 01:27:00,467
Right now, a younger man is after her. But,
feels a little guilty

728
01:27:02,571 --> 01:27:07,508
True. Feels guilty for you

729
01:27:07,676 --> 01:27:12,443
I know it all and I don't mind it
so, it's alright

730
01:27:12,548 --> 01:27:17,576
I'm happy to even become the third person.
The important thing is there's love

731
01:27:18,621 --> 01:27:24,617
What now, let me wait for you?<i>l</i>How can it be?
I have you let it go

732
01:27:25,461 --> 01:27:29,557
I'm not that kind of man. I won't ever stay still
if I see those two together

733
01:27:32,535 --> 01:27:35,504
Min A breaks up with me

734
01:27:35,604 --> 01:27:39,631
Why?<i>l</i>She won't ever be there for me anymore

735
01:27:40,509 --> 01:27:46,573
I really can't do anything. I'm really hurt here
It's so strange

736
01:27:47,716 --> 01:27:53,450
What should I do now, my friend
sekarang aku harus bagaimana?<i>l</i>Why are you crying?

737
01:27:53,656 --> 01:27:56,489
I feel sorry for her

738
01:27:56,592 --> 01:28:00,653
It's alright. Is she the only woman there is?

739
01:28:07,436 --> 01:28:08,596
Thank you

740
01:28:10,539 --> 01:28:12,666
My love won't change

741
01:28:13,476 --> 01:28:17,674
Yes, love won't change,
only people does

742
01:28:25,554 --> 01:28:31,550
This is..<i>l</i>You scared me.
What are you doing there?

743
01:28:32,628 --> 01:28:37,429
''My love won't ever change''

744
01:28:37,633 --> 01:28:44,471
You two came together. Better let him eat
some noodle before leaving

745
01:28:44,607 --> 01:28:48,509
Get lost<i>l</i>Do you still want to be with him?

746
01:28:50,513 --> 01:28:52,572
Why are you doing thins to me?<i>l</i>Why?

747
01:28:53,716 --> 01:28:58,619
You...Don't have sex with him

748
01:28:59,522 --> 01:29:01,581
Why?<i>l</i>It's just.. don't.

749
01:29:01,657 --> 01:29:04,626
Such an awful manners<i>l</i>What?

750
01:29:05,694 --> 01:29:14,602
Right, I'm rude. You feel better now? Are you happy
that boy is after you. What a shameless woman

751
01:29:15,704 --> 01:29:25,409
People must know this.
People, Hyun Woo is going to punch me!

752
01:29:25,481 --> 01:29:26,448
Are you crazy?

753
01:29:26,582 --> 01:29:31,519
As of now, I won't let you hit me anymore.
Why should I let you hit me?

754
01:29:31,587 --> 01:29:35,523
Don't you know why I always let you hit me?

755
01:29:42,464 --> 01:29:48,403
Do you know the meaning of love?
The true love?

756
01:29:48,437 --> 01:29:53,670
You just love your own self

757
01:29:55,611 --> 01:30:01,447
Don't you ever thought of that man is married?
That he's taken away from his wife?

758
01:30:01,550 --> 01:30:06,487
But you're not, right? That's why you only
think of your feelings and cried

759
01:30:06,622 --> 01:30:14,552
It's been 18 years I've been keeping you safe.
From your back, you should've at least looked back at me

760
01:30:15,598 --> 01:30:17,463
It's only you that's heart-broken?

761
01:30:17,666 --> 01:30:20,567
My heart's broken, too!

762
01:30:25,708 --> 01:30:28,472
No one's asked you to love me!

763
01:30:30,579 --> 01:30:32,604
We must not meet each other anymore

764
01:30:36,552 --> 01:30:38,645
Can you stay away from me?

765
01:31:00,509 --> 01:31:05,412
Do I love that kind of woman? Don't be kidding!

766
01:31:06,482 --> 01:31:09,610
I don't want to see you ever, either
Go away!

767
01:31:17,559 --> 01:31:22,656
That evil woman could've told me today might rain

768
01:33:03,499 --> 01:33:05,626
Sorry

769
01:33:18,447 --> 01:33:22,406
Even without a definite answer, I can understand

770
01:33:22,451 --> 01:33:26,410
Although that man's suffers, but I've
forgot him

771
01:33:27,589 --> 01:33:30,558
The funny guy in front of me....<i>l</i>
Let me do the talk

772
01:33:31,493 --> 01:33:34,621
I'll get back to be a friend, just that.

773
01:33:37,566 --> 01:33:39,534
I'm sorry<i>l</i>Alright

774
01:33:40,469 --> 01:33:43,438
I'm the one who's wrong,
because it's me who decided to do it

775
01:33:45,574 --> 01:33:49,510
This is my gift for you.
It's my love story for Kim Hyun Woo

776
01:33:51,613 --> 01:33:53,547
But... Who's the third?

777
01:33:54,483 --> 01:33:55,541
Third one's..

778
01:33:58,520 --> 01:34:02,547
Is so similar to me.
A strange friend, Joon Soo

779
01:34:02,658 --> 01:34:03,647
Joon Soo?

780
01:34:04,726 --> 01:34:06,660
Joon Soo..

781
01:34:08,564 --> 01:34:13,524
We must not meet each other anymore

782
01:34:17,439 --> 01:34:23,537
Not anymore now. For 18 years; When it's
raining, snowing, or even at storm

783
01:34:24,646 --> 01:34:26,637
Oppa

784
01:34:29,418 --> 01:34:32,581
He's always behind me, protecting me.
Watched over me

785
01:34:36,458 --> 01:34:39,621
Joon Soo, now he's not here anymore

786
01:34:49,671 --> 01:34:54,438
For you and noona, from now on
there's pig feet in our menu

787
01:34:54,576 --> 01:34:58,444
We've decided to be married.
We've back together

788
01:34:59,548 --> 01:35:02,676
these pig feet...I
really hate these

789
01:35:02,718 --> 01:35:06,552
Before, it was for Hyun Woo
that I ate these with her

790
01:35:07,522 --> 01:35:09,490
If you're like this, I'd tell her

791
01:35:09,591 --> 01:35:12,617
Don't talk of her in front of me
anymore, I don't want to see her again

792
01:35:20,435 --> 01:35:30,470
Wind speed of 250km/h
moves from northeast to southwest area

793
01:35:30,545 --> 01:35:36,609
Moving on to western area and
it's predicted there'll be heavy rain

794
01:35:42,691 --> 01:35:53,568
Everyone, please be careful
and be prepared

795
01:35:53,669 --> 01:35:59,574
aku Eun Soo. Today's news so interesting

796
01:36:00,676 --> 01:36:04,544
It really is

797
01:36:06,548 --> 01:36:11,645
Right. She's that kind of person

798
01:36:12,487 --> 01:36:16,480
Teacher, you and unnie are alright?

799
01:36:16,558 --> 01:36:21,461
Don't want to see me anymore
How can she say that to me?

800
01:36:21,496 --> 01:36:25,432
Now's not the time to complain
Have you seen this, teacher?

801
01:36:25,701 --> 01:36:27,601
Major problem

802
01:36:40,415 --> 01:36:42,474
It's terrible!

803
01:36:43,552 --> 01:36:49,457
She covers her face, but
it's clearly Hyun Woo

804
01:36:49,491 --> 01:36:54,690
With someone's husband<i>l</i>What a scandal

805
01:36:59,701 --> 01:37:01,601
She's innocent

806
01:37:02,537 --> 01:37:03,595
Let me take responsibility

807
01:37:03,705 --> 01:37:08,608
Have you seen the news?
It must be stopped!

808
01:37:08,643 --> 01:37:13,546
The love triangle is exposed.
The news has spread all over the place

809
01:37:13,682 --> 01:37:16,708
It's a fact, already too hard to cover it

810
01:37:17,419 --> 01:37:22,584
That's right, it's a fact. It's unavoidable.
She's over this time

811
01:37:22,657 --> 01:37:27,458
Like a whore, really shamefull

812
01:37:27,629 --> 01:37:31,429
What now?<i>l</i>Is there a time
to talk about it?

813
01:37:39,508 --> 01:37:46,641
I can't work with such dirty slut like you.
You stole my position and do this..

814
01:37:53,722 --> 01:38:00,525
She's fired hasn't she? She's finished

815
01:38:21,516 --> 01:38:23,484
What's this?

816
01:38:25,587 --> 01:38:28,488
She's in major problem. Look..

817
01:38:31,626 --> 01:38:33,617
Pick up the call

818
01:38:47,476 --> 01:38:48,534
Is she at your place?

819
01:38:48,610 --> 01:38:51,579
No, I'm looking for her too.
Still haven't found her, what now?

820
01:38:52,447 --> 01:38:54,540
I'd go crazy, what to do?
Where is she, actually?

821
01:38:54,649 --> 01:38:57,584
Didn't she said to you, when she's drunk
that she'd

822
01:38:57,586 --> 01:39:00,521
go to Han River?<i>l</i>Don't you talk like that!

823
01:39:02,524 --> 01:39:04,424
Taxi!

824
01:39:15,537 --> 01:39:17,471
To Tung Street please, hurry!

825
01:39:19,541 --> 01:39:20,633
Yes, mother. What is it?

826
01:39:42,697 --> 01:39:45,689
What can I do, now?

827
01:39:47,536 --> 01:39:49,504
I really don't know

828
01:39:54,609 --> 01:40:00,445
Actually, I know that for 18 years, you've been
behind me, guarding me

829
01:40:01,583 --> 01:40:05,485
I also know that I always
overlooked your whole-hearted feelings

830
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:09,456
All that you've done,
for my sake

831
01:40:10,692 --> 01:40:13,456
But, you said that I don't see
you behind me

832
01:40:19,601 --> 01:40:25,540
Even though I know that I'm a selfish person,
but I miss Joon Soo so much

833
01:40:35,684 --> 01:40:43,557
''Every hardship is a way for you happiness''.
We can eventually overcome every problems

834
01:40:44,526 --> 01:40:45,458
Great

835
01:40:46,428 --> 01:40:50,558
That's what I've always wanted
to hear<i>l</i>So boastful. Why, you

836
01:40:55,570 --> 01:40:59,529
Why don't you scold me?
Aren't I supposed to be scold at?

837
01:41:00,475 --> 01:41:05,412
You've this grown up, it's no use anymore.
Also, you're now at a distress state

838
01:41:08,583 --> 01:41:10,448
I've made a mistake

839
01:41:11,553 --> 01:41:17,458
But, I'm not distressed
anymore<i>l</i>Yes. Love

840
01:41:17,459 --> 01:41:22,658
Isn't always runs smoothly.
But, everything's will be alright

841
01:41:23,632 --> 01:41:30,629
Apparently, my father is that
type<i>l</i>He was like Joon Soo when he was young

842
01:41:31,473 --> 01:41:36,501
Is it true? Dad's like Joon
Soo?<i>l</i>So, at that time, I

843
01:41:36,544 --> 01:41:41,572
followed her words<i>l</i>That's also
your luck

844
01:41:44,452 --> 01:41:51,654
Mother, I don't deserve
this luck

845
01:41:59,567 --> 01:42:04,595
Don't worry

846
01:42:09,544 --> 01:42:12,570
Eat up

847
01:42:13,481 --> 01:42:21,547
I said, I don't have any appetite<i>l</i>I think..<i>l</i>I don't want to hear what you think<i>l</i>Sorry<i>l</i>Don't think over it too much

848
01:42:22,457 --> 01:42:28,657
He doesn't understands women's feelings.
Even at his age. My son..

849
01:42:29,597 --> 01:42:36,469
Sometimes, actions are more important<i>l</i>really
hard to understand<i>l</i>eat up, hurry

850
01:44:08,530 --> 01:44:12,398
Has she gone?<i>l</i>She'll
get on a plane this afternoon

851
01:44:12,467 --> 01:44:21,569
That's unacceptable, teacher. Bring her back...

852
01:44:22,677 --> 01:44:25,612
His girlfriend's also like her

853
01:44:25,680 --> 01:44:31,482
She doesn't understand your honest
feelings<i>l</i>He didn't explain that to her

854
01:44:31,586 --> 01:44:38,492
Silence, everyone! I think, it's all his fault

855
01:44:38,593 --> 01:44:43,462
What are you doing, teacher? Hurry, bring her back,
if not, you'll regret this your whole life

856
01:45:20,702 --> 01:45:24,604
I beg you.. don't leave

857
01:45:33,548 --> 01:45:39,578
Kim Hyun Woo, can you be with me?
I don't feel anything in my heart yet

858
01:45:39,687 --> 01:45:43,418
For you, until now
I'm not a man?

859
01:45:43,591 --> 01:45:46,560
You're not a man for me

860
01:45:50,565 --> 01:45:55,502
I said, wait a minute.<i>l</i>Hurry up<i>l</i>Let's walk together

861
01:45:55,637 --> 01:46:00,631
Hurry up.<i>l</i>Together with me

862
01:46:42,584 --> 01:46:44,552
Where'd we go, really?

863
01:46:45,687 --> 01:46:54,425
I might be weak all this time. Before I regret
more, I wanted to speak up my heart

864
01:47:00,602 --> 01:47:03,594
Hyun Woo, do you remember this?

865
01:47:04,539 --> 01:47:09,476
Let's ride it together. If I
have a boyfriend, I would,

866
01:47:09,510 --> 01:47:14,447
with him<i>l</i>If I ride it,
would you be my girlfriend?

867
01:47:17,552 --> 01:47:20,646
Are you alright? Aren't you
afraid of height?

868
01:47:24,692 --> 01:47:27,422
I don't want to be friends with you anymore

869
01:47:28,496 --> 01:47:32,489
Now, I wanted to hold your hands
and live happily together

870
01:47:35,436 --> 01:47:38,405
Can you hear it?<i>l</i>Yes

871
01:47:38,573 --> 01:47:43,601
Can you hear it? Please, answer<i>l</i>Yes, I do

872
01:47:57,625 --> 01:48:02,585
Don't go to Europe, be my girlfriend

873
01:48:03,665 --> 01:48:07,601
I'd carry you everyday,
I'd buy pig feet your you everyday

874
01:48:07,635 --> 01:48:11,571
I'd let you hit me everyday

875
01:48:12,607 --> 01:48:18,443
and everyday, I'd try hard
to touch your heart

876
01:48:30,525 --> 01:48:39,558
I...I am going to give it my all to
be a real man. I can't be without you

877
01:48:44,639 --> 01:48:48,405
From now on, look at me. Don't
say you don't see my presence

878
01:48:48,643 --> 01:48:55,446
Not that I don't see you.
I can see you clearly. I'm so sorry

879
01:48:55,717 --> 01:48:59,619
I've always known your feelings,
but I've always pretend that I don't

880
01:48:59,620 --> 01:49:03,522
and breaks your heart.
I'm so sorry!

881
01:49:05,493 --> 01:49:11,659
I won't go to Europe/ What did
you say? I can't hear you!

882
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:17,401
I'm not going to Europe!
I won't leave, you fool!

883
01:49:18,606 --> 01:49:24,511
Promise me<i>l</i>Yes, I promise!

884
01:49:55,676 --> 01:50:00,443
Are you alright? Are you ok?

885
01:50:07,522 --> 01:50:09,490
I love you!

886
01:50:13,561 --> 01:50:20,558
Can you hear me? I'd love you more.
Everyday, I'd love you more

887
01:50:27,508 --> 01:50:29,442
Me too

888
01:50:44,458 --> 01:50:48,519
I know. So, you have to hold on tight

889
01:50:52,633 --> 01:50:56,626
I love you! I love you most!

890
01:50:58,439 --> 01:51:02,705
I LOVE YOU!

891
01:51:26,434 --> 01:51:31,394
Are you alright? Fool. Are you alright?

892
01:51:36,444 --> 01:51:38,412
Get off, hurry

893
01:51:56,597 --> 01:52:01,466
Thank you, really
Thank you<i>l</i>What a fool.

894
01:52:01,636 --> 01:52:07,575
Finally, after 18 years
I said "I love you"

895
01:52:12,680 --> 01:52:19,518
And, I also succeeded to overcome
my fear of height<i>l</i>Hey!

896
01:52:20,454 --> 01:52:23,480
Joon Soo!

897
01:52:30,631 --> 01:52:34,590
In the end, Joon Soo doesn't disappoint me

898
01:52:35,469 --> 01:52:38,438
If we think about it,
it's all the same like any other day in these 18 years

899
01:52:38,439 --> 01:52:41,408
Was then, speak up his
heart with his life

900
01:52:55,623 --> 01:53:00,651
Before I get out of hospital and
until now she doesn't let go of my hand

901
01:53:01,662 --> 01:53:07,658
I've fallen in love again.
That's how we become a pair of lover

902
01:53:16,577 --> 01:53:24,541
Together, only me and Kin Hyun Woo.
The innocent Kim Hyun Woo

903
01:53:24,685 --> 01:53:28,621
Two people walking in the same direction.
There's nothing we hidden

904
01:53:28,656 --> 01:53:32,592
between us. Loving each other like
everybody else

905
01:53:33,594 --> 01:53:41,501
Everyday, my heart's touched.
Everyday, full of passion.
Everyday, always more..

906
01:53:45,506 --> 01:53:48,441
What's my girlfriend doing, now?

907
01:53:48,509 --> 01:53:51,569
How are you, everyone? I'm
Kim Hyun Woo. Is back.

908
01:53:51,579 --> 01:53:54,639
Today's perfect for doing this

909
01:53:55,449 --> 01:54:00,580
Jump with me, together.
OK. Don't be afraid

910
01:54:01,622 --> 01:54:03,590
GO....!

911
01:54:06,627 --> 01:54:08,595
Jump..!

912
01:54:14,702 --> 01:54:18,433
What should I do now..
