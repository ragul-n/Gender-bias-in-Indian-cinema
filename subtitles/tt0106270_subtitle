00:00:00,734 --> 00:00:03,328
Ivebeen watching you.
for the last two hours

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,403
"It's like moving with a bloody mirror!
I can't even think, because of you!"

4
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:26,081
You ape me! You even smoke like me!
Soon Im going to quit smoking!

5
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,088
Me too! It is a bad habit

6
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:38,434
"One second,... why are you
getting so angry?'

7
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,131
Are you Damodar?

8
00:00:45,813 --> 00:00:47,804
What is the telephone number
of your residence?

9
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,671
Im neither interested in your
films nor your heroes! Got it?!

10
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:16,666
Don't try to bug me!

11
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:27,180
"- Karan, is Deepak there?
- oh, sister-in-law. Im Deepak.'

12
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:33,023
"While writing your name on her wrist,
Shivangi slit her nerve.'

13
00:01:34,028 --> 00:01:37,361
Im calling from Holy spirit hospital
Please rush here soon.

14
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:39,689
And don't tell Karan anything.

15
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,691
"Sister-in-law, don't worry,
Ill be there right away.'

16
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:53,369
Hey jerk!

17
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:14,557
Not now sister.

18
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:18,899
"Sister-in-law, how is Shivangi?
Is she out of danger?'

19
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:22,231
Yes. But even the doctors
were scared initially.

20
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:28,409
She just wouldn't stop bleeding.
I thought I had lost her.

21
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,083
"Sister-in-law, don't cry.
Everything will be all right"

22
00:02:34,088 --> 00:02:38,081
Shivangi was my husband's favorite.

23
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,484
She is like a daughter to me.

24
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:47,097
- I wonder why she was so crazy?
- I very well understand this.

25
00:02:48,102 --> 00:02:50,093
I have a cure for it too.

26
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:56,265
Please wait here.

27
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:28,638
What madness is this?

28
00:03:29,143 --> 00:03:34,137
You had told me that someone else
is a greater fan of yours than me.

29
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:37,477
Who had etched your name
on her wrist

30
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:41,481
"I also tried, but I don't know
when I fell unconscious.'

31
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:46,816
I had lied to you folks.

32
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:51,992
- But I took it seriously.
- But..

33
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:55,161
But why?

34
00:03:57,004 --> 00:04:02,840
So that my name is on top
of the list of your fans.

35
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:07,177
can anyone love someone so dearly?

36
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,515
Yes.

37
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,510
Will you come close?

38
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:21,858
Closer.

39
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:26,856
I love you.

40
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:43,339
Whatever you are doing
is not good.

41
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:47,343
And what is it that Im doing?

42
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:52,348
Don't try to hide from me.
I know everything. You and Deepak...

43
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:59,689
- It's better if you don't meet him.
- Why? Isn't he a nice human being?

44
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:06,872
"of course, he is
a very nice person.'

45
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:09,698
- But..
- But what?

46
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:13,373
"Look, Chutki. It's not advisable
to talk to Karan now.'

47
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:19,048
"As, all he can think about is
your brother's killer.'

48
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,050
"If I talk to him now,
he will get angry.'

49
00:10:22,556 --> 00:10:26,890
So I suggest you remain quiet for
a few days and not meet each other.

50
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:30,886
When the time is right Ill
personally talk to him.

51
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:36,559
"And Im sure, Karan will
never say no to me.'

52
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:42,568
"
Don't cry, Chutki.'

53
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:50,744
What happened?
- Ill never meet you again.

54
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:55,749
Not meet me?
Why not?

55
00:10:57,257 --> 00:11:00,920
Because neither brother nor
sister-in-law will be happy.

56
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:05,253
Hence it's better....
if we don't meet again.

57
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,762
Why not? Why won't Karan accept
our relationship?

58
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:12,932
We love each other. Ill
straight away go and tell him...

59
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:16,264
...that I want to marry you.

60
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:20,602
"No, Deepak. Karan will
never understand our feelings.'

61
00:11:21,615 --> 00:11:23,947
He cannot see beyond
the law and his duties.

62
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,617
He won't understand our sentiments.

63
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:31,455
Why won't he? Hitherto no one
has made an effort

64
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:34,783
Love can even melt a
stone-hearted person.

65
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:38,291
What? Love?!
And that too brother Karan?

66
00:11:38,632 --> 00:11:41,465
"He can't even smile,
what will he think about love.'

67
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:46,795
He will Shivangi.
We will teach him how to love.

68
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:51,634
"When he realizes what love is,
he'll value our love too.'

69
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:54,970
And after that our
path will be cleared.

70
00:11:55,148 --> 00:12:01,144
No way. He's always talking
about guns and bullets.

71
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:03,646
Which girl is crazy to
fall in love with him?

72
00:12:04,491 --> 00:12:08,325
"There is a girl Shivangi.
And he will fall in love.'

73
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:13,495
Ill bring such a twist in his life
that he'll be left with no choice.

74
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:19,497
Not everybody get what they want

75
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:25,676
Why not? Tell me something.
How do you find Karan?

76
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:27,843
Absolutely boring.

77
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:33,008
of course. All the time he moves
around with a sick look on his face.

78
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:36,686
There's no smile on his lips.
A curt look.

79
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:39,518
And neither have I seen
any sympathy in his eyes.

80
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,690
You know how he
looks when he walks?

81
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:46,093
Like a loaded revolver
dressed like a man.

82
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:52,035
Don't say that He has lot of
sympathy for you if not for others.

83
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,096
oh forget it
That's a load of bull-shit!

84
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:57,036
He can never have sympathy
for anybody.

85
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:01,046
That's where you are wrong.
You have only seen his face.

86
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:03,872
Come down a bit and
peep into his heart

87
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:09,044
He's like a coconut
A hard exterior and tender within.

88
00:13:10,724 --> 00:13:12,715
I don't believe you.

89
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:17,727
Why don't you believe me?!
I...I swear to...my make up.

90
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:22,224
I stay with him 24 hours. And most
of the time he only talks about you.

91
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:25,063
About me? Really?

92
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:28,067
"Ijust swore, and still you
don't believe me?'

93
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:31,737
- What does he say?
- He says that..

94
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:34,737
He says that..

95
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:41,581
He doesn't say anything.
He's foolish in this matter.

96
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:46,089
- But one thing really hurts him.
- What?

97
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:49,251
That you dance on the streets
and bandy words with men.

98
00:13:49,763 --> 00:13:52,254
And...and pick pockets.

99
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,592
What do I do? I have to do
something for a living.

100
00:13:57,103 --> 00:14:00,095
"No, Basanti. Don't sacrifice your
love for your living.'

101
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:04,103
Just imagine that you are a
police officer's wife.

102
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:08,607
You'll get so much of respect

103
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:33,137
"Just imagine, your orphan children
will at least have a father.'

104
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:51,821
- You have come?!
- Hey! At least leave my uniform!

105
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:56,325
"- You want to be a police officer?
- Yes, I do!"

106
00:14:57,664 --> 00:15:01,657
- You dare scold my children?!
- I was only...

107
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:06,995
You didn't answer my question.

108
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:10,167
"speak up, Basanti.
speak up!"

109
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:15,171
What do I say?
This dream can't come true.

110
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:18,507
- It can Basanti. It can!
- How come?

111
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:23,178
- Will you do as I say?
- I will

112
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,521
Why did you get me here?

113
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:34,361
"- Buddy, Im very unhappy today.
- What do I do?'

114
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:38,535
"Look, buddy.
I have no one in this world.'

115
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:42,197
Only Dhansukh... my secretary.

116
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:47,035
"- And you, my friend.
- Listen to me carefully.'

117
00:15:47,881 --> 00:15:52,875
Im no friend of yours. After your
work is over we go separate ways.

118
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,711
And why have you got me here?

119
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,547
Whether you take me as
your friend or not..

120
00:15:57,724 --> 00:16:00,716
I want to spend the evening with you.
- Why?

121
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:04,890
Because today is my birthday.

122
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,561
- Now what?
- Today is my birthday.

123
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:16,230
- How about a drink?
- No. I lose control over myself.

124
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:20,243
"You must've drunk hooch. Ill
treat you to ""Deepak Kumar special"".'

125
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,242
"- No, I won't
- Today is my birthday!"

126
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,577
- Only one.
- okay.

127
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,411
- Let's go.
- One is for enmity.

128
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:32,422
"- I don't care. I won't drink!
- Scared, eh?'

129
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:37,753
Me?

130
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,941
- That's it
- Is that all?

131
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:17,296
I forget to tell you.
Basanti had called this morning.

132
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:18,797
She sounded scared.

133
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:21,966
"She says every night at 10,
someone knocks at her door.'

134
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:24,140
- Why?
- I don't know.

135
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,140
You left her among the wolves.

136
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:29,475
"Imagine, if someone breaks open
the door, then her chastity will..'

137
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,314
Why will anyone do that?

138
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,721
Ive taken responsibility to protect
her honour! Understood!

139
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:40,324
You are here and she is there.

140
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,321
I must go.

141
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:48,831
He has not yet come.

142
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:03,004
He is here!

143
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:10,349
You? You are drunk?

144
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:16,689
No.
I...am drunk.

145
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:42,215
"You here, at this hour
of the night?'

146
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:48,391
One should solve night problems
in the night only.

147
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:53,726
At 10 o'clock some son-of-a-gun...

148
00:18:55,735 --> 00:19:01,401
"...knocks at your door,
and disturbs your peace.'

149
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:06,905
He's here?

150
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:20,586
Don't open the door.
Im getting very scared.

151
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,092
But what are you doing?
Please stay away.

152
00:19:28,935 --> 00:19:33,599
"The next time he knocks,
Ill pounce at him immediately.'

153
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:36,598
And Ill beat him so much...

154
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:47,109
Stay back.

155
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,310
My clothes with hers?

156
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:43,665
"
Basanti, what happened?'

157
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:47,669
You have ruined me!

158
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:51,006
Im undone!

159
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,842
Last night you did
whatever you liked.

160
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:59,347
- What..what did I do?
- What did you do?! You...

161
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:10,859
"- Basanti, don't cry. Listen to me.
- Don't come near me!"

162
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:14,533
One minute. Ill just come.

163
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:33,723
Come again?
You did everything?

164
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:36,885
You raped that girl?

165
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:44,229
People revere and respect cops.

166
00:21:45,238 --> 00:21:50,574
And that very inspector
has outraged...

167
00:21:52,078 --> 00:21:53,238
a girl's modesty?

168
00:21:53,379 --> 00:21:57,406
I could never imagine that you
are a devil in disguise.

169
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,910
Poor Basanti.

170
00:22:02,588 --> 00:22:06,080
I didn't do it deliberately.
It was an accident

171
00:22:07,593 --> 00:22:08,753
What do I do?

172
00:22:11,597 --> 00:22:14,430
What do I tell you?
You have only two options.

173
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:18,593
Either serve a term for
seven years for rape...

174
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:22,440
...or get married to her.

175
00:22:22,608 --> 00:22:25,771
How's that possible? Neither does
she know me nor do I love her.

176
00:22:26,546 --> 00:22:29,447
As far as knowing you is concerned
by now she knows you too well

177
00:22:30,116 --> 00:22:35,281
And as for love... you know this
country of ours is amazing.

178
00:22:35,788 --> 00:22:39,280
Girls here fall in love with
their husbands after marriage.

179
00:22:40,126 --> 00:22:42,287
"Just get married,
she will start loving you.'

180
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:44,793
- Shall I send for invitation cards?
- Hey! Wait!

181
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:46,955
- But...
- No ifs and buts.

182
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:53,803
"Tell me something, if she tells
you that she loves you...'

183
00:22:53,973 --> 00:22:55,463
...then will you marry her?

184
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:58,967
"- Yes...if...
- Yes, speak up!"

185
00:22:59,645 --> 00:23:03,979
If she says ' I love you '
then it's fine.

186
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:12,481
Deepak here. Do as I have told you.
Im giving Karan the phone.

187
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:29,005
Whatever happened last night..
I am....

188
00:23:29,842 --> 00:23:32,003
...extremely sorry.

189
00:31:03,629 --> 00:31:05,620
"- Basanti, here.
- Yes?'

190
00:31:05,798 --> 00:31:10,792
Goli's goods worth millions have
been delivered to a godown at Vashi.

191
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:13,737
"If you wish, you can raid
that place right now.'

192
00:31:14,006 --> 00:31:15,997
"- Now?
- Yes, hurry up...'

193
00:31:16,141 --> 00:31:18,632
because at 4 p.m
the goods will be shifted....

194
00:31:18,811 --> 00:31:21,143
...and delivered to
their respective dealers.

195
00:31:21,814 --> 00:31:22,974
4 p.m!

196
00:31:31,323 --> 00:31:33,484
"According to Basanti, there must
be only four to five men here.'

197
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:38,490
Im going down and you...
will stay here.

198
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:41,989
"- You won't come after me, okay!
- Why?'

199
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:44,492
Why not?
I will come!

200
00:31:46,505 --> 00:31:49,497
Fine. Come after me.

201
00:32:09,528 --> 00:32:11,860
"
Karan, if you don't release me!"

202
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:56,790
Come on!

203
00:34:59,364 --> 00:35:00,695
The keys!

204
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:30,216
Quick!

205
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:05,752
Why?

206
00:36:05,931 --> 00:36:08,263
"If it wasn't for your
timely help, Id have...'

207
00:36:10,602 --> 00:36:16,438
"By saving my life, you have proved
that you are a hero and not a zero.'

208
00:36:21,113 --> 00:36:25,607
Today I saved your life. Will you
give me anything I ask for?

209
00:36:25,784 --> 00:36:27,274
What?

210
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:32,113
"Karan, I...I love your sister
and want to marry her.'

211
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:57,475
Such a big loss?
Such a big loss?!

212
00:37:01,153 --> 00:37:03,144
Only half an hour more.

213
00:37:05,991 --> 00:37:08,482
Only half an hour more!

214
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:14,321
And the goods would have been
delivered to the dealers.

215
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:20,828
There's someone.

216
00:37:22,174 --> 00:37:24,165
There's someone amongst us...

217
00:37:25,677 --> 00:37:30,341
...who is a police informer.

218
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:51,692
- Yes?
- Should I say something?

219
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:56,864
Im getting scared. You go in
and Ill wait out?

220
00:37:57,542 --> 00:38:00,875
- Why?
- Ive a wife and four children.

221
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:06,043
Im the only bread winner. And this
terrorist has committed 30 murders.

222
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:10,721
- Thirty murders?
- If I die they will become orphans.

223
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:14,715
Im getting very scared.

224
00:38:17,229 --> 00:38:18,218
What's this?

225
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:27,232
"Why are you fooling at this time?
Forget it, sir.'

226
00:38:28,073 --> 00:38:30,064
What's this for?

227
00:38:30,575 --> 00:38:33,908
"When the terrorist comes, you'll
lose your heel Keep it in!"

228
00:38:34,246 --> 00:38:38,239
"Sir, you go in.
May God protect you.'

229
00:38:47,092 --> 00:38:52,758
This is loaded.
Keep it

230
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:57,595
Only to protect you.

231
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:03,601
"If required, shoot only
at the leg. If required.'

232
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,333
And don't come out
of the jeep.

233
00:39:08,947 --> 00:39:10,938
Don't step out of the jeep.

234
00:39:43,148 --> 00:39:45,309
"Stop, or Ill shoot
Stop!"

235
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:48,141
"
Stop, or Ill shoot!"

236
00:39:53,825 --> 00:39:55,156
He has a machine gun!

237
00:40:00,832 --> 00:40:02,823
He is running away!
Shoot!

238
00:40:04,936 --> 00:40:07,166
Stop! Stop!

239
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,191
What have you done?

240
00:40:38,036 --> 00:40:39,367
You shot Ramlal?!

241
00:40:40,705 --> 00:40:43,538
No! I thought it was someone else.

242
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:46,707
Do you know the consequences of
shooting a police officer?

243
00:40:48,046 --> 00:40:49,035
No.

244
00:40:49,214 --> 00:40:51,375
Didn't I tell you
not to step out of the jeep.

245
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:55,383
Didn't I tell you to shoot
at the leg?

246
00:40:56,054 --> 00:41:00,047
Why did you shoot on the chest?
What have you done?

247
00:41:19,077 --> 00:41:21,068
Ive killed a constable.

248
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:28,576
"My life, my career everything
has got ruined.'

249
00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:38,919
Listen.

250
00:41:39,097 --> 00:41:42,760
- Give me this revolver.
- You are arresting me?

251
00:41:46,271 --> 00:41:52,267
"If someone learns you've committed
this murder, you'll be hanged.'

252
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,502
Ill only lose my job.

253
00:41:57,949 --> 00:42:02,784
"And if I take the blame on myself,
you'll be saved.'

254
00:42:04,456 --> 00:42:08,119
And so will your career.

255
00:42:10,128 --> 00:42:12,119
At the most..

256
00:42:14,299 --> 00:42:18,633
... Ill lose my job and will
be sentenced for a year or two.

257
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:25,473
You must leave
this city and go away.

258
00:42:26,478 --> 00:42:29,970
Forget that such a thing ever
happened or you saw it happen.

259
00:42:32,317 --> 00:42:37,311
Ill handle everything.
Nothing will happen to you.

260
00:42:39,157 --> 00:42:40,488
Nothing.

261
00:42:41,157 --> 00:42:46,993
Give all kind of monetary
support to Ramlal and his family.

262
00:42:47,163 --> 00:42:48,824
Ive explained everything
to my secretary.

263
00:42:48,898 --> 00:42:53,665
"Appoint a nice lawyer, if you want
Don't worry about the money.'

264
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:55,995
One minute. Take this.

265
00:42:56,673 --> 00:43:01,508
Ill be here for a few days.
Do keep me informed.

266
00:43:02,178 --> 00:43:04,646
"And Karan, Ill phone you
after every half an hour.'

267
00:43:04,848 --> 00:43:08,011
Don't make that mistake.
Because the lines will be tapped.

268
00:43:08,685 --> 00:43:12,177
"If someone hears our conversation,
we'll be sentenced for a year or two.'

269
00:43:12,522 --> 00:43:14,513
"
okay, I won't phone.'

270
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:45,544
"Wait, Deepak.
What are you doing?'

271
00:43:46,389 --> 00:43:50,553
"Karan, on one hand, is staking
his life and his career.'

272
00:43:51,227 --> 00:43:53,889
And you are running
away like a coward?

273
00:43:54,731 --> 00:43:57,723
Is your conscience dead?

274
00:43:58,234 --> 00:44:01,726
"You love Shivangi a lot, don't you?
Then how will you face her?'

275
00:44:02,238 --> 00:44:07,073
"Get up, Deepak.
And confess to your crime!"

276
00:44:23,426 --> 00:44:26,918
He was shaking with fear.

277
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:30,926
He placed his head on my stomach.
I was getting tickled

278
00:44:31,267 --> 00:44:33,258
... I was about to jump.

279
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:36,762
"Thank God, I didn't Or the
truth would have been unveiled.'

280
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:40,770
"
But one thing is for sure, sir.'

281
00:44:41,678 --> 00:44:46,274
"The way you drove him out of the city,
he'll remember all his life...'

282
00:44:46,616 --> 00:44:49,278
that even police officers
are good actors.

283
00:44:49,786 --> 00:44:53,278
"- Who is it?
- It's you. okay, tell me something.'

284
00:44:54,791 --> 00:44:58,625
I loaded fake bullets in the revolver.
But how did you start bleeding?

285
00:44:59,295 --> 00:45:01,957
- Was that blood?
- Then what was it?

286
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:03,690
Tomato ketchup.

287
00:45:05,635 --> 00:45:11,471
"I filled it in a plastic bag and kept
it here, and pressed it like this.'

288
00:45:11,808 --> 00:45:13,799
"And seeing the ketchup,
he lost his senses.'

289
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:20,810
"- Sir, only one clap.
- Put your vest in.'

290
00:45:20,984 --> 00:45:24,647
To hell with the vest
I feel like jumping with joy.

291
00:45:26,489 --> 00:45:28,480
How he ran for his life!

292
00:45:30,493 --> 00:45:34,657
"Let alone coming here,
his plane won't even...'

293
00:45:36,666 --> 00:45:40,830
"- What is it?
- The plane has landed, sir.'

294
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:43,162
Landed? Where?

295
00:46:00,523 --> 00:46:03,356
This vest has become too long.
Ill go and change it

296
00:46:08,198 --> 00:46:10,189
So last night...

297
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:13,195
...we were out to nab
a dangerous terrorist?

298
00:46:14,537 --> 00:46:18,200
And I shot your constable
by mistake?

299
00:46:21,711 --> 00:46:23,872
You did a great favour to me.

300
00:46:25,381 --> 00:46:28,873
You took the revolver from me
and put your finger prints on it?

301
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:35,217
"Look, next time you raise
your hand...'

302
00:46:35,458 --> 00:46:39,724
"Let alone beating you, I can
get you arrested for fraud!"

303
00:46:40,396 --> 00:46:43,388
You claim to be an inspector?!
A police officer!

304
00:46:44,234 --> 00:46:46,395
But you are a cheat!

305
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:50,403
And you and your cheap constable
were making fun of me?!

306
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:59,575
"I was crazy about you, because
you were a complete man!"

307
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:05,415
"By aping your style, your walk,
I wanted to win an award!"

308
00:47:06,589 --> 00:47:08,250
But..but now I won't

309
00:47:09,826 --> 00:47:12,090
Because I don't like
aping fakes.

310
00:47:13,296 --> 00:47:17,756
Just once you should have caught
me by my collar slapped me...

311
00:47:17,834 --> 00:47:24,103
"...and asked me, how dare
I fell in love with your sister?'

312
00:47:25,441 --> 00:47:29,104
I would have beseeched you.

313
00:47:29,612 --> 00:47:34,447
Fallen at your feet and asked
your sister's hand in marriage.

314
00:47:36,619 --> 00:47:41,454
But no. Tears can melt hearts but
not stone-hearted people like you.

315
00:47:42,792 --> 00:47:45,124
"You are a heartless, ruthless
shrewd person!"

316
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:49,459
You neither care about your sister
nor her love nor her happiness!

317
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:51,657
And not even her future!

318
00:47:52,702 --> 00:47:58,299
"Mr. inspector, first learn to protect
hearts. You may then protect the law!"

319
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:03,973
If moving around with guns and
acting tough is duty for you...

320
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,313
Then you are wrong!
It's your pride and ego!

321
00:48:07,817 --> 00:48:09,808
We call it the act of a bully.

322
00:48:15,658 --> 00:48:18,821
"You wanted me to go away
from your life, didn't you?'

323
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:22,821
And your sister's life too?
All right Im going away! Forever!

324
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:27,497
"Be happy, and if possible
let others also be happy.'

325
00:48:39,182 --> 00:48:44,848
"If I have made any mistake
unknowingly, then do forgive me.'

326
00:48:49,525 --> 00:48:53,188
Take care.

327
00:49:21,691 --> 00:49:23,716
Are you happy now?

328
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:28,553
"Are you happy, having broken
your kid sister's heart?'

329
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,062
You claim to be her elder brother!

330
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:40,566
"But have you ever asked her what she
wants, have you ever sat with her?'

331
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:46,244
You didn't fulfill your duty
but I will fulfill mine!

332
00:49:46,983 --> 00:49:49,417
"Im not only her sister-in-law,
but her mother too.'

333
00:49:50,253 --> 00:49:56,089
And Deepak is the right choice
as a son-in-law!

334
00:49:57,427 --> 00:49:59,918
"If someone else
comes to marry her,...'

335
00:50:00,596 --> 00:50:04,259
I won't be alive to welcome him.

336
00:50:05,802 --> 00:50:09,101
"Had he been alive, then his decision
would have also been the same, Karan.'

337
00:50:21,951 --> 00:50:23,612
"
Dhansukh, where's Deepak?'

338
00:50:23,786 --> 00:50:27,779
He went upstairs. He was in a
bad mood. Anything wrong?

339
00:50:28,624 --> 00:50:32,617
"Actually, Ive come to seek
an alliance for my sister.'

340
00:50:32,862 --> 00:50:36,298
- That's good news.
- I don't accept this alliance!

341
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:43,303
You loved Shivangi a lot
So what happened all of a sudden?

342
00:50:44,807 --> 00:50:48,800
She can't stay without you.
Don't you love her?

343
00:50:49,045 --> 00:50:51,479
"I do!
And I will till my last breath!"

344
00:50:51,981 --> 00:50:55,644
"But what you did with me,
I can't forget all my life!"

345
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:02,652
- I know I made a small mistake.
- small mistake?!

346
00:51:03,659 --> 00:51:07,493
"Had I not returned from the airport,
you had almost got rid of me!"

347
00:51:09,499 --> 00:51:13,833
But my conscience told me...

348
00:51:14,003 --> 00:51:15,994
that Karan is giving
such a big sacrifice.

349
00:51:16,072 --> 00:51:19,838
"He's staking his life.
Go back, Deepak!"

350
00:51:21,511 --> 00:51:26,346
And when I returned I saw this!
What did you think I was?!

351
00:51:26,682 --> 00:51:30,516
"Deepak, you can't do this!
You can't play with Shivangi's life!"

352
00:51:30,686 --> 00:51:33,177
- You have got to marry her!
- I won't! What will you do?

353
00:51:33,523 --> 00:51:35,514
I...

354
00:51:38,861 --> 00:51:42,024
What can I do?
Nothing.

355
00:51:44,367 --> 00:51:46,358
Nothing.

356
00:51:50,706 --> 00:51:53,038
- On one condition.
- What?

357
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:58,373
First smile and say please.

358
00:52:06,889 --> 00:52:08,880
"
smile, Karan.'

359
00:58:49,458 --> 00:58:52,450
"- Get up, Ramlal
- No, sir.'

360
00:58:53,462 --> 00:58:57,455
It's time to leave the world.

361
00:58:57,633 --> 00:58:59,794
"- Don't joke, Ramlal!
- No, sir.'

362
00:59:01,303 --> 00:59:05,637
"Im not joking, sir.
Ive been really shot"

363
00:59:07,309 --> 00:59:12,144
Today I learnt how painful it is
when you get really shot

364
00:59:12,982 --> 00:59:15,815
"- Nothing will happen to you. Get up!
- No, sir.'

365
00:59:19,154 --> 00:59:23,488
"
Sir, will you do me a favour?'

366
00:59:25,828 --> 00:59:28,160
- What?
- Won't you tell me?

367
00:59:28,998 --> 00:59:32,161
"
Ramlal go and tuck your vest in!"

368
00:59:35,337 --> 00:59:38,170
"
Say it, sir.'

369
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:42,170
No.

370
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:53,015
What's this? Such a short meeting?
We had just met

371
00:59:54,523 --> 00:59:55,854
And he left?

372
01:00:29,892 --> 01:00:33,726
Friends! From today they
are my foreign partners.

373
01:00:34,897 --> 01:00:39,231
They do the same business in their
country which we do here.

374
01:00:40,736 --> 01:00:43,068
They don't stay anywhere for more
than an hour or two.

375
01:00:43,906 --> 01:00:46,067
Because they are wanted by
the police all over the world!

376
01:00:47,076 --> 01:00:49,408
Soon they will leave.

377
01:00:50,245 --> 01:00:53,408
So I wanted you to meet them.

378
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:57,575
Because many of you will have to
go to their country for business.

379
01:01:08,597 --> 01:01:11,930
"Come, Mr. Peter. Ill introduce
you to my partners.'

380
01:01:12,601 --> 01:01:15,593
This is Mr. Ram Mohan.
This is Mr. Peter.

381
01:02:21,503 --> 01:02:25,837
Basanti here.
I have found proof against Goli.

382
01:02:28,343 --> 01:02:30,504
"Mona just left from here,
she had camera in her hand"

383
01:02:30,679 --> 01:02:32,340
What?

384
01:02:37,419 --> 01:02:40,183
"someone has made a call to the
police station from here, sir.'

385
01:02:40,522 --> 01:02:43,355
- From which room?
- 402. From Mona's room.

386
01:02:43,692 --> 01:02:46,024
- What nonsense?!
- She is on line!

387
01:02:46,762 --> 01:02:49,356
Put me through.

388
01:02:52,701 --> 01:02:57,035
This roll contains all the black
deeds of these smugglers.

389
01:02:57,706 --> 01:02:59,367
And not only that

390
01:02:59,908 --> 01:03:05,369
With the help of these picture you can
easily arrest Goli and his men.

391
01:03:06,048 --> 01:03:08,039
This is the best opportunity.

392
01:03:08,784 --> 01:03:12,049
"Through this roll you can
get to your brother's killer.'

393
01:03:12,654 --> 01:03:16,055
"- And send them to the gallows.
- Hi, love.'

394
01:03:21,396 --> 01:03:23,387
Ill call you later.

395
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:29,594
Whom were you talking to?

396
01:03:30,906 --> 01:03:33,739
A...a friend of mine.

397
01:03:49,424 --> 01:03:52,257
Where is the roll?

398
01:03:54,930 --> 01:03:56,921
Which roll?

399
01:04:01,603 --> 01:04:08,270
Then why is there sweat on
your brow so beautiful?

400
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,271
What are you saying?

401
01:04:15,784 --> 01:04:20,118
Don't you believe your Mona?

402
01:04:38,473 --> 01:04:40,964
I was wondering...

403
01:04:43,812 --> 01:04:49,808
"...how our goods were being seized,
despite all the secrecy.'

404
01:04:51,153 --> 01:04:55,146
And who has been giving information
to inspector Karan?

405
01:04:56,024 --> 01:04:59,653
So it's you!
You!

406
01:05:18,513 --> 01:05:20,504
I loved Mona very much.

407
01:05:22,351 --> 01:05:24,342
When I could kill her with
my very hands....

408
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:28,683
...you...you are just her
look alike.

409
01:05:30,525 --> 01:05:32,516
Imagine what Ill do to you.

410
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:42,534
"
Tell me, where's the roll?'

411
01:05:44,039 --> 01:05:46,200
Look here and tell me
where is the roll?!

412
01:05:47,709 --> 01:05:52,203
- Where it should have reached!
- Where?!

413
01:05:54,883 --> 01:05:57,545
To inspector Joglekar!

414
01:06:26,581 --> 01:06:32,417
- There's bad news for you.
- What nonsense are you talking?

415
01:06:36,758 --> 01:06:41,092
Your Basanti is in my custody.

416
01:06:43,265 --> 01:06:45,256
Ill tell you later
who I am.

417
01:06:46,435 --> 01:06:50,394
- First give me the roll
- Roll?! Which roll?

418
01:06:50,772 --> 01:06:55,607
Or Ill cut your Basanti
into pieces...

419
01:06:55,777 --> 01:06:59,941
...and throw her in the courtyard
of your police station.

420
01:07:02,884 --> 01:07:04,613
But the roll..

421
01:07:05,287 --> 01:07:08,279
"
So inspector, are you dumbfounded?'

422
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:13,952
"- I want an answer.
- okay, Ill give you the roll"

423
01:07:14,463 --> 01:07:16,454
But nothing should happen
to Basanti.

424
01:07:17,966 --> 01:07:19,627
"
Tell me, where must I bring it?'

425
01:07:24,139 --> 01:07:26,972
Listen carefully.

426
01:07:34,316 --> 01:07:36,307
Is Basanti okay?

427
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:40,811
Basanti's life is in danger.

428
01:07:41,890 --> 01:07:46,327
"They want the roll which they
didn't find it with Basanti.'

429
01:07:47,829 --> 01:07:51,321
They think I have it
But where do I get it from?

430
01:07:52,501 --> 01:07:54,492
- The usual trick!
- Meaning?

431
01:07:54,669 --> 01:07:58,070
Buy any roll from the market
Till they develop it..

432
01:07:58,140 --> 01:08:00,335
-...we'll get her released.
- How can...

433
01:08:04,012 --> 01:08:07,004
We shouldn't underestimate
'
our enemles.

434
01:08:08,183 --> 01:08:12,347
"We'll take the roll
but my way.'

435
01:08:13,688 --> 01:08:15,679
I might escape from the
police here.

436
01:08:17,526 --> 01:08:22,361
But the police abroad will
find me at any cost

437
01:08:24,199 --> 01:08:26,190
They won't spare me.

438
01:09:43,945 --> 01:09:45,936
You think Karan is a fool?!

439
01:09:46,615 --> 01:09:49,277
If I don't leave with Basanti
in ten minutes...

440
01:09:49,784 --> 01:09:52,116
...he will be here with the
entire police force.

441
01:10:08,136 --> 01:10:09,296
Where is the roll?

442
01:10:23,818 --> 01:10:25,479
Get it here.

443
01:10:27,322 --> 01:10:28,812
First show me Basanti.

444
01:10:42,504 --> 01:10:45,837
"Look, Ive got another
gift for you.'

445
01:10:47,008 --> 01:10:49,841
Which will make you come to me
running like a small child.

446
01:10:51,346 --> 01:10:52,836
Look.

447
01:11:30,885 --> 01:11:34,548
Hey actor.
Where are you going?

448
01:11:36,057 --> 01:11:38,048
You think Im a fool?

449
01:11:38,893 --> 01:11:42,886
"First the roll will be developed,
then printed...'

450
01:11:44,399 --> 01:11:49,063
...the photographs will be seen
and then they will be released.

451
01:11:53,742 --> 01:11:55,733
"
Deepak, move!"

452
01:12:30,812 --> 01:12:31,938
Stop those scoundrels!

453
01:12:35,784 --> 01:12:36,773
Quick!

454
01:13:26,835 --> 01:13:27,995
Blast the tire!

455
01:13:43,017 --> 01:13:44,006
Come out!

456
01:13:46,855 --> 01:13:48,345
Move!

457
01:14:39,073 --> 01:14:41,064
"
It's very painful isn't it?'

458
01:14:42,076 --> 01:14:45,739
Actually you have also caused me
terrible pain in my life.

459
01:14:47,081 --> 01:14:48,571
Therefore...

460
01:14:50,251 --> 01:14:54,085
...there's a strange intoxication
in causing you pain.

461
01:14:54,923 --> 01:14:56,914
I like it

462
01:14:59,928 --> 01:15:01,919
Im enjoying.

463
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:22,113
"
Look, tell me where the roll is!"

464
01:15:23,952 --> 01:15:29,788
Or you will undergo this torture
for a week.

465
01:15:31,292 --> 01:15:36,787
I might get tired.
But he is a devil

466
01:15:39,801 --> 01:15:41,792
Let alone a week.

467
01:15:43,137 --> 01:15:48,131
Continue this even for a year!
yet I won't give you the roll

468
01:15:49,477 --> 01:15:50,637
I won't!

469
01:15:50,812 --> 01:15:52,803
Why do you want to
torture yourself to death?

470
01:15:54,148 --> 01:15:57,982
Die like your brother died.
An easy death.

471
01:16:01,489 --> 01:16:03,480
You know how your brother died?

472
01:16:04,325 --> 01:16:08,318
"At my behest, he pumped five
bullets into him.'

473
01:16:10,665 --> 01:16:13,156
He was torn to shreds.

474
01:16:15,336 --> 01:16:18,328
You see this loyal
servant of mine?

475
01:16:20,341 --> 01:16:22,332
He is very heartless.

476
01:16:26,180 --> 01:16:28,171
"Bloody hell don't hit me
on my face!"

477
01:16:28,683 --> 01:16:33,017
You know the value of my face is
more than your master's factory.

478
01:17:03,718 --> 01:17:09,554
"Never mind. When he comes around,
start the torture again.'

479
01:17:11,225 --> 01:17:13,216
He won't acquiesce so soon.

480
01:21:48,669 --> 01:21:53,163
"Be it in film or reality, hero always
rescues the damsel in distress.'

481
01:21:57,845 --> 01:21:59,506
Hurry up.

482
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:14,521
Wait

483
01:22:53,734 --> 01:22:57,727
Come on out!

484
01:22:58,739 --> 01:23:03,403
Or your artist friend won't be alive
to perform before the world!

485
01:23:04,412 --> 01:23:09,247
Come out! Or Ill kill everybody!

486
01:23:10,751 --> 01:23:14,744
Come out!

487
01:24:23,491 --> 01:24:26,654
Ask me what fear is?!
When I leave home in the morning.

488
01:24:26,827 --> 01:24:29,489
Im not sure whether Ill return
home in the evening or no!

489
01:24:31,065 --> 01:24:35,001
I can't say at which crossroad
death waits to maim me!

490
01:24:35,836 --> 01:24:40,000
"He's saying exactly what I told him!
Yes, exactly the same!"

491
01:24:42,343 --> 01:24:44,675
"- Sir, he has copied...
- Be quiet"

492
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:48,671
He is looking so nice
in this uniform.

493
01:24:58,092 --> 01:25:01,027
- Where are you going?
- I don't want to see this film.

494
01:25:16,210 --> 01:25:18,201
"
Nice film, isn't it?'

495
01:25:41,235 --> 01:25:42,224
Is something burning?
