1
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,791
<span style="style.default_1">I don't know who this new witness is.</span>

2
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:49,458
<span style="style.default_1">No one knows it, Mr. Batliwala,</span>

3
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:52,708
<span style="style.default_1">but legal expert, Karuna Singh has</span>
<span style="style.default_1">a different question for the commissioner.</span>

4
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:54,041
<span style="style.default_1">Commissioner Wadia,</span>

5
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:57,375
<span style="style.default_1">why is the CBI not investigating</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the Stanley D'Mello case?</span>

6
00:00:57,458 --> 00:01:00,500
<span style="style.default_1">Since it's odd, the police</span>
<span style="style.default_1">is investigating itself.</span>

7
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:03,500
<span style="style.default_1">Five years ago we lacked evidence, madam.</span>

8
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:06,333
<span style="style.default_1">Now this new witness</span>

9
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:10,291
<span style="style.default_1">pops out of nowhere just when</span>

10
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:14,375
<span style="style.default_1">Mr. Pandya enters politics!</span>

11
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:21,833
<span style="style.default_1">Are we saying this</span>
<span style="style.default_1">on Indian national television</span>

12
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:24,916
<span style="style.default_1">that there's a system</span>
<span style="style.default_1">that protects witnesses?</span>

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,541
<span style="style.default_1">You can't call it a system.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">There's no infrastructure.</span>

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,833
<span style="style.default_1">However, we hide</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the identity of key witnesses,</span>

15
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:33,583
<span style="style.default_1">but only until conviction.</span>

16
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:36,291
<span style="style.default_1">You mean conviction or acquittal?</span>

17
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:41,166
<span style="style.default_1">Because, the famous the accused</span>

18
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:45,083
<span style="style.default_1">the faster he goes free,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">while the witnesses disappear.</span>

19
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:47,750
<span style="style.default_1">The point here is</span>
<span style="style.default_1">if we want to change the system,</span>

20
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:50,875
<span style="style.default_1">our politicians must change</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the way they think!</span>

21
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:51,875
<span style="style.default_1">Politicians!</span>

22
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:53,125
<span style="style.default_1">We don't make the law.</span>

23
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:56,500
<span style="style.default_1">Laws are made by the State.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">We just enforce them, that's all.</span>

24
00:01:58,375 --> 00:01:59,666
<span style="style.default_1">My Lord</span>

25
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:19,958
I had told you
where you'd find a plain sari.

26
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:21,291
Didn't you find it?

27
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:29,291
<span style="style.default_1">Child,</span>

28
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,500
<span style="style.default_1">I had to leave...</span>

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
<span style="style.default_1">so that whatever happens here...</span>

30
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:41,208
<span style="style.default_1">does not destroy your life.</span>

31
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,000
<span style="style.default_1">My Lord</span>

32
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:55,791
<span style="style.default_1">The choice that I have made</span>

33
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,500
<span style="style.default_1">As I left home today</span>

34
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:02,041
<span style="style.default_1">My Lord</span>

35
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:09,625
<span style="style.default_1">The choice that I have made</span>

36
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:14,458
<span style="style.default_1">As I left home today</span>

37
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:17,791
<span style="style.default_1">Whatever I need</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I will take it from You right now</span>

38
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:20,791
<span style="style.default_1">That is for God to say</span>

39
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,083
-Hey! She's burning something!
-That's Karan Kapoor!

40
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,333
Karan Kapoor!

41
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,833
<span style="style.default_1">My Lord</span>

42
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,125
<span style="style.default_1">O lord of mine, You are the light</span>

43
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:59,833
<span style="style.default_1">By which I see the path</span>

44
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:05,125
<span style="style.default_1">As I lay down</span>
<span style="style.default_1">And say Your name in prayer</span>

45
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,875
<span style="style.default_1">I have lost myself</span>

46
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,625
<span style="style.default_1">In my love for You</span>

47
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:21,791
<span style="style.default_1">Let the world believe</span>
<span style="style.default_1">That I have gone crazy</span>

48
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:27,458
<span style="style.default_1">As I lay down</span>
<span style="style.default_1">And say Your name in prayer</span>

49
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,083
<span style="style.default_1">My Lord</span>

50
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,833
Kaboom!

51
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,916
Kaboom!

52
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,375
-Sir, take this.
-Kaboom!

53
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:04,166
Get ready for the killer shot.

54
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:08,083
Kaboom!

55
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,041
Gopi.

56
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,208
Gopi?

57
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:18,875
What are you doing?

58
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,416
It's a Line of Control.

59
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,708
Imagine there are chairs
on the left and right!

60
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,000
Cross at your peril!

61
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,875
-Sir...
-From top to bottom...

62
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:29,083
<span style="style.default_1">Should I call Ms. Ira?</span>

63
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:37,875
<span style="style.default_1">Don't cross the line, sir.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">These guys are Ms. Ira's spies.</span>

64
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,625
She needs to know what's going on here.

65
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,375
I'm coming in!

66
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,416
Raju? What are you doing?

67
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:46,875
I'm not allowed to talk to the enemy.

68
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:47,833
What?

69
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:52,125
<span style="style.default_1">Today is 20th December</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and the weather is still hot.</span>

70
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,416
I hope you're keeping your cool

71
00:05:57,875 --> 00:06:01,541
In fact, happy Sunday
if you're relaxing at home

72
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:04,791
<span style="style.default_1">or chilling in jail.</span>

73
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:10,083
<span style="style.default_1">And a special hello</span>
<span style="style.default_1">if you're just chasing your tail.</span>

74
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,583
-My auto rickshaw is fine!
-That's great!

75
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:25,125
-It is your mistake.
-Who's going to pay for my damage?

76
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:30,458
He hasn't left the film, silly!

77
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,416
-This is a new scooter.
-It's just a minor scratch.

78
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,791
Replacing me means

79
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,208
How will I travel to my workplace now?

80
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:41,375
If that witch finds out I'm helping you

81
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:44,750
I won't just be banned from the sets
I will lose my job, Gopi!

82
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,166
Why should I give you 300 rupees?

83
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:49,708
Who the hell are you to teach me?

84
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,125
-Shh.
-But your job...

85
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:54,208
-If you're done, let's go.
-What do you mean?

86
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,458
-Madam said, "left, left, left."
-And you obeyed her.

87
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,125
So this is your fault.

88
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,208
You want to fight with me now?

89
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,583
It's no joke. There's oil leaking.

90
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:07,875
-Hey! You... Show some respect!
-Hey!

91
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:10,833
-How about you do?
-What are you doing, man?

92
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,166
What are you doing?

93
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,833
-Return her helmet.
-Who are you? Don't touch me.

94
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:15,750
Don't touch me.

95
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,958
I told you to go! Oh, my God!

96
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:20,291
-Rascal!
-Sir...

97
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:21,541
You again!

98
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,541
Hey...

99
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,375
-Stop!
-Hey, stop!

100
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,458
-Her cell phone!
-Stop!

101
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:30,125
He took her cell phone.

102
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:32,208
Hey, stop!

103
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,500
-Stop!
-You will be cursed for life!

104
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,541
-Why did you interfere?
-Everyone was simply standing there.

105
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,666
Hey, madam! Madam, wait!

106
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:20,625
<span style="style.default_1">I'm so excited for this special someone</span>
<span style="style.default_1">for whom...</span>

107
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:26,291
That person is about to get
a chance to meet

108
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:29,416
<span style="style.default_1">with our celebrity mystery interview.</span>

109
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,791
Yes, you guessed it.

110
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:41,458
I'm talking about
our Lucky Lunchtime winner

111
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,416
who'll be in the studio soon.

112
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,791
Take a message, it's urgent.
Tell her it's about Karan Kapoor.

113
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,791
<span style="style.default_1">She has your mobile number, right?</span>

114
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:58,958
Not that number,
the one I'm calling from.

115
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,750
Hello? My lift!

116
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,041
Hey.

117
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,916
Bring sweetmeats for the boys.

118
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,291
Yes, sir.

119
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,666
<span style="style.default_1">Two weeks ago</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Satya Rahi Party leader</span>

120
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,666
<span style="style.default_1">and former ACP, Kamlesh Pandya</span>

121
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,333
<span style="style.default_1">refused to apply for bail</span>
<span style="style.default_1">entering judicial custody.</span>

122
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,375
<span style="style.default_1">Tomorrow Pandya</span>
<span style="style.default_1">will head to Bombay High Court</span>

123
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:15,750
<span style="style.default_1">to defend a charge</span>
<span style="style.default_1">that five years ago</span>

124
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:18,583
<span style="style.default_1">he let rogue police officer,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Stanley D'Mello escape the law.</span>

125
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:22,166
<span style="style.default_1">D'Mello, who was last seen</span>
<span style="style.default_1">fitting this description in 2012</span>

126
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:25,541
<span style="style.default_1">was an undercover officer</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and a master of disguise.</span>

127
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:30,750
<span style="style.default_1">Is it possible he's still alive</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and protected by Pandya?</span>

128
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:32,833
<span style="style.default_1">Viewers may remember,</span>

129
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:36,625
<span style="style.default_1">D'Mello disappeared</span>
<span style="style.default_1">after carrying out 21 encounters.</span>

130
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,541
<span style="style.default_1">Encounters in which</span>
<span style="style.default_1">he killed Don Arun Naik,</span>

131
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:43,208
<span style="style.default_1">his entire gang,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and some of his family members too.</span>

132
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:45,750
<span style="style.default_1">Perhaps such violence is acceptable</span>

133
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:48,375
<span style="style.default_1">given the murder</span>
<span style="style.default_1">of a police officer's wife.</span>

134
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,916
<span style="style.default_1">But revenge always hurts the innocent.</span>

135
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:56,208
<span style="style.default_1">D'Mello left his daughter,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Alice, in a Christian orphanage</span>

136
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:59,958
<span style="style.default_1">where she later died of typhoid fever.</span>

137
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,750
<span style="style.default_1">Nobody knows the kind of feud this was.</span>

138
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,666
<span style="style.default_1">Whatever lies behind the mystery</span>
<span style="style.default_1">of D'Mello,</span>

139
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:10,125
<span style="style.default_1">the prosecution is confident</span>
<span style="style.default_1">that a new witness</span>

140
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:13,625
<span style="style.default_1">will secure a high profile conviction.</span>

141
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:18,666
<span style="style.default_1">If so, Pandya's political ambitions</span>
<span style="style.default_1">will surely end.</span>

142
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:24,250
Boss, what do I do?
Criminals work on Sundays too.

143
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,625
We need the station opened.
How else will we serve the public?

144
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,916
Fine, I'll hold.

145
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:35,750
Dheere...

146
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:42,083
Sir, repeating my name isn't helping.

147
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,541
What are you doing?

148
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:47,208
Landline. I've exhausted my monthly
cell phone allowance.

149
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,125
I won't pay from my pocket.

150
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,583
But, come on, my brother-in-law
is a good cop.

151
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,916
-Greetings.
<span style="style.default_1">-Greetings, Chacha.</span>

152
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,083
<span style="style.default_1">I met with an accident on Turner Road</span>
<span style="style.default_1">while riding the scooter.</span>

153
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,875
It's nothing major.
Just some oil is leaking.

154
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:28,875
So I'll be a little late
to deliver the parcel.

155
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:30,458
Parcel.

156
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:33,583
Yeah, I'm at Joe's Garage,
off the Turner Road.

157
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:36,708
If we have time, I can get it fixed here.

158
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,625
<span style="style.default_1">Chacha?</span>

159
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:42,500
He had to go. He's not home.

160
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,958
-Without his mobile?
<span style="style.default_1">-Maybe, he forgot it.</span>

161
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:48,041
<span style="style.default_1">And who are you?</span>

162
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,750
We go way back.

163
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,500
<span style="style.default_1">Joe's Garage is off Turner Road, right?</span>

164
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,750
Yeah, it will just take 20 minutes or so.
I'll get it fixed.

165
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,916
Yeah, fix the scooter first

166
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,333
and then come here.
Chacha will be back by then.

167
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,416
I'll just apologize to him
and offer him some money.

168
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:19,958
Dhanendra.

169
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:23,875
Your brother-in-law is here.

170
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,666
We're illegal, according to the BMC.

171
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,666
-What?
-That's hardly surprising.

172
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,875
Most police stations
are gifted by builders.

173
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,458
Who's this?

174
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,458
Some brute took her phone
and assaulted me.

175
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:41,666
It was the other way around.
He got my phone stolen!

176
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:46,416
What?

177
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,500
Let me see your face.

178
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:56,041
You selected today of all days
to pick a fight.

179
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,375
-Is it swollen?
-Yes.

180
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:58,458
Let me have a look.

181
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,166
Got it!

182
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,708
Great. At least we can make a report.

183
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:03,750
Hey!

184
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,041
I'm not filing a report.

185
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,791
What do I do? She's sitting in my car.

186
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,250
Pick up the phone.

187
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,166
Do your work.

188
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:35,083
<span style="style.default_1">Ms. Meghna Shergill?</span>
<span style="style.default_1">It's about your overdue bill.</span>

189
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,333
<span style="style.default_1">Two days back you said you'd pay it.</span>

190
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,916
<span style="style.default_1">If you don't pay up,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">we'll cancel your service.</span>

191
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,416
When will you pay?

192
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,208
When my shop reopens.

193
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,750
<span style="style.default_1">They'll be dressed to impress!</span>

194
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:03,000
<span style="style.default_1">Pintu, tell Papa to smarten up.</span>

195
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,375
<span style="style.default_1">His usual sloppy look won't do.</span>

196
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,750
<span style="style.default_1">Not at Zapata's. Where are you?</span>

197
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,291
<span style="style.default_1">Are you listening, Pintu?</span>

198
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:10,958
I'll give the message to Pintu, Aunt.

199
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,583
<span style="style.default_1">Who's this on Pintu's--</span>

200
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,041
To keep the line free.

201
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,708
Witness the FIR please.

202
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,541
Fair skin?

203
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,416
He wasn't short. More tall and broad.

204
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,958
The color of the scooter is wrong.

205
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:44,083
-How? Pink is pink.
-No, it was more...

206
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:45,958
It was more like purple.

207
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,166
-Is that so?
-Yes.

208
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:52,166
How can I sign it?

209
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,708
It's all wrong.

210
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:05,458
<span style="style.default_1">The person you're trying to reach</span>
<span style="style.default_1">is busy on another call.</span>

211
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:06,625
Hey, Pintu!

212
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:12,250
-She calls you Pintu now, is it?
-Ugh, God, come on.

213
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:14,916
You...

214
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,833
Does this have a connection
with the dating app?

215
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,208
And why isn't she wearing her shoes?

216
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,125
Hello? Listen!

217
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:43,791
I'm ready to pay for my phone,
but within reason, please.

218
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:47,125
Hmm. You've changed your tune.

219
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:51,708
Huh? I have an emergency in the office.
Who were you talking to?

220
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:54,083
First, you tell me,
whose cell phone are you calling from?

221
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:56,625
Well, uh, I met my neighbor.

222
00:17:57,166 --> 00:18:00,000
-Hello.
-Please tell me who you were talking to.

223
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,875
Why don't you guess?

224
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,000
Pintu is here.

225
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,375
-How do I know? Archana?
-He came to meet me.

226
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,041
No, it wasn't Archana.

227
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,250
I have no clue. Uh, Gopi?

228
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,875
Our plan in the afternoon is fixed, right?

229
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,083
<span style="style.default_1">Who is Gopi?</span>

230
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:17,833
He's my boss. What do you want?
I'll lose my job.

231
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:20,291
<span style="style.default_1">It wasn't your boss.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">But it was a man.</span>

232
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,208
Is this a game?

233
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:23,541
<span style="style.default_1">You're a strange girl.</span>

234
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:26,000
Do you ever think about the poor Uncle
who lives in Delhi?

235
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:30,750
If there are any changes,
then let me know.

236
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:33,666
-Did you speak to my father?
-Someone had to!

237
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,666
You haven't picked up
his call in two weeks.

238
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,916
-Do you think this is a joke?
<span style="style.default_1">-I want you to do this.</span>

239
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:41,875
Call Uncle now and tell him
you're fine. All right?

240
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,791
Otherwise we're all done.

241
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,458
<span style="style.default_1">And if you want to chat further,</span>

242
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,625
then pay your bill!

243
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,666
What are you doing with my feet?

244
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,875
I need to go!

245
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:57,750
Then who'll drop me home?

246
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:00,916
Let my brother-in-law trap this psycho.
Don't go it alone.

247
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:13,833
<span style="style.default_1">He didn't sound creepy to me.</span>

248
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:16,625
<span style="style.default_1">-Mom, mind if I talk to my daughter?</span>
<span style="style.default_1">-I'm not stopping you!</span>

249
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,833
<span style="style.default_1">Just tell me what</span>
<span style="style.default_1">"it's complicated" means!</span>

250
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:22,416
-I will seriously unfriend you, Granny.
<span style="style.default_1">-There we are!</span>

251
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:25,250
Hello. Granny...

252
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,708
I don't know. I'm out of credit maybe.

253
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,666
Just give your number
to my brother-in-law.

254
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:19,000
I'll sell my car and give you the money.
Okay?

255
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,208
Note her address.

256
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:36,250
Who hit you? Huh?

257
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:38,416
Her boyfriend?

258
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:42,125
Please don't tell this to Mom.

259
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,166
Oh, God, you're such a blabbermouth.

260
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:03,250
Hey, madam! Call the other hero
from my cell phone.

261
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,333
What?

262
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:09,583
Hey!

263
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:18,958
That's illegal!

264
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,708
Your entire police station is illegal!

265
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,625
See, here's the girlfriend's number.

266
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:43,416
Should we tell Pintu about this?

267
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:46,541
Let it be.

268
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,916
<span style="style.default_1">Oh, hi! This is Meghna's Granny,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">from Delhi.</span>

269
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,750
Oh, uh. Hi, Granny, how are you?

270
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:06,791
-<span style="style.default_1">Is she with you?</span>
-No, Granny, she's not.

271
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:10,583
<span style="style.default_1">Cool! Let's talk freely!</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Her father has gone out.</span>

272
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:11,750
Uh...

273
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:14,958
-Talk about what?
<span style="style.default_1">-Meghna! Who else?</span>

274
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:17,791
<span style="style.default_1">Poor thing's lost it</span>
<span style="style.default_1">ever since her mother died.</span>

275
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:21,000
-Her mom died?
<span style="style.default_1">-Didn't she mention that?</span>

276
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:24,916
<span style="style.default_1">She got so bad that I thought</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I'd have to move in.</span>

277
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:29,375
<span style="style.default_1">Now I'm going to trust you.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Or I will move in with you.</span>

278
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:30,583
Whoa.

279
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:34,416
<span style="style.default_1">Now, I have a personal question,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">so don't mind.</span>

280
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,666
No, uh, Granny,
I wouldn't know how to answer.

281
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,083
<span style="style.default_1">Just tell the truth.</span>

282
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:42,375
<span style="style.default_1">-Did you get Meghna pregnant?</span>
-Pregnant?

283
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:46,083
<span style="style.default_1">She hasn't told you that either!</span>
<span style="style.default_1">She's usually quite frank.</span>

284
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:48,208
No... uh...

285
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:52,208
-I just left her.
<span style="style.default_1">-How could you just leave her?</span>

286
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:54,958
<span style="style.default_1">She's probably pregnant,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and you ditched her!</span>

287
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:57,041
-Granny, listen...
<span style="style.default_1">-No, you listen!</span>

288
00:22:57,291 --> 00:23:03,083
<span style="style.default_1">Being a Dad takes more than</span>
<span style="style.default_1">15 minutes of exercise.</span>

289
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:06,916
<span style="style.default_1">Whatever is wrong, fix it!</span>

290
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,166
<span style="style.default_1">Try chocolates!</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Or take her out for ice cream!</span>

291
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,375
Papa asked me to call
as soon as you hand over the phone to me.

292
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,500
<span style="style.default_1">That's fine, but how do I</span>
<span style="style.default_1">delete this video?</span>

293
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:19,166
-Which video?
-The one you shot during the accident.

294
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:22,916
Don't do that! I mean I'll do it.

295
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,541
-My phone is temperamental.
-Just like its owner.

296
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:31,208
Um, do you drink coffee?

297
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:33,791
I have work to do,
there's no time to socialize.

298
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,291
What if I come to you?

299
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:42,500
I'll call you
after I'm done with my meeting.

300
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:48,791
Look... Look, I don't have all day.

301
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:49,875
<span style="style.default_1">Get yourself to Mahim.</span>

302
00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:51,041
It's a ladies model.

303
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:57,583
By Sitladevi temple,
next to a school, there's a PCO

304
00:23:57,875 --> 00:24:00,583
run by a kid
so no danger at all.

305
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:07,666
-Where's the parcel?
-Parcel?

306
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:09,583
Where is the parcel?

307
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,208
Which parcel, Sherlock?

308
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:17,708
Oh my days!

309
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:21,500
Hey!

310
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:28,916
Hey! Hey! Scooter! Oh, Pinky!

311
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,916
-My money!
-My brother-in-law will pay!

312
00:24:57,333 --> 00:25:01,458
Yes, Mom. I'm still stuck in traffic.
Get a taxi to Zapata's!

313
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,375
Mom, I'm driving!

314
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:14,708
No, don't pull over.

315
00:25:19,208 --> 00:25:20,541
I have credit on my phone now.

316
00:25:27,791 --> 00:25:29,625
that some guy left you like this.

317
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:31,375
Mohit called?

318
00:25:31,458 --> 00:25:33,583
Mohit? Now that bastard has a name?

319
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:40,000
your granny thinks that I'm the father
of his baby, that you're carrying!

320
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:33,625
I was taking down his number,
when he hit me from behind.

321
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,958
Add this to the report.

322
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:43,083
-And mention terror suspect in the report.
-First class, sir!

323
00:26:47,916 --> 00:26:50,125
-<span style="style.default_1">Something's wrong.</span>
-So I heard.

324
00:26:51,125 --> 00:26:52,916
The trial is still on tomorrow.

325
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:55,958
They're yet to find Chacha. Don't panic.

326
00:26:56,041 --> 00:26:57,500
<span style="style.default_1">There's an alert on</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the guy on the scooter.</span>

327
00:26:57,708 --> 00:27:00,916
Hmm. We need to finish this today.

328
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:05,708
The city has changed.

329
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,291
<span style="style.default_1">What if there's another witness?</span>

330
00:27:08,208 --> 00:27:12,291
You never leave a trace,
that's why I called you back.

331
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:29,416
Ramakanth!

332
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:33,750
Why are you so worried?
Who do you think will testify against him?

333
00:27:39,166 --> 00:27:42,583
People, it's 1:30
and you know what that means!

334
00:27:42,666 --> 00:27:44,625
It's Lucky Lunchtime time!

335
00:27:44,708 --> 00:27:47,291
With me are two lucky winners.
Mr. Balvinder Bhalla

336
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:50,541
-and his sweet nephew, Jaswinder.
-Jazz!

337
00:27:50,791 --> 00:27:52,000
<span style="style.default_1">Jazz?</span>

338
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:55,291
<span style="style.default_1">Jazz, you flew in from Gurudaspur</span>
<span style="style.default_1">just to meet Karan Kapoor!</span>

339
00:27:55,375 --> 00:27:56,416
<span style="style.default_1">Karan--</span>

340
00:28:09,541 --> 00:28:11,416
-For your children.
-Sister...

341
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:19,000
<span style="style.default_1">I am amazed how you</span>
<span style="style.default_1">quickly answered the question which was,</span>

342
00:28:19,083 --> 00:28:21,916
<span style="style.default_1">"What was Karan Kapoor's</span>
<span style="style.default_1">first theatre role?"</span>

343
00:28:23,041 --> 00:28:24,000
<span style="style.default_1">Sita!</span>

344
00:28:24,083 --> 00:28:27,416
<span style="style.default_1">Sita. The Goddess, from the classic epic.</span>

345
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:31,583
<span style="style.default_1">He's been Karan Kapoor's</span>
<span style="style.default_1">biggest fan since he was a kid.</span>

346
00:28:31,666 --> 00:28:34,125
<span style="style.default_1">Karan was a bigger star back then.</span>

347
00:28:34,208 --> 00:28:37,333
<span style="style.default_1">-I don't know what he does now.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">-So, let's connect you!</span>

348
00:28:41,916 --> 00:28:44,458
<span style="style.default_1">Jazz, be ready. Balvinder, be ready.</span>

349
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:08,833
Maybe he's not picking up
because he's shooting. Such a star!

350
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:11,000
He doesn't even know we're here.

351
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:16,083
Of course, he knows!
And his PR team is listening in.

352
00:29:16,958 --> 00:29:19,833
<span style="style.default_1">The lady at the reception</span>
<span style="style.default_1">didn't even offer us water.</span>

353
00:29:20,208 --> 00:29:23,166
<span style="style.default_1">-Have my coffee, sir.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">-Forget it.</span>

354
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:30,500
Just tell them
there was an accident on set.

355
00:29:30,583 --> 00:29:31,791
That will buy us some time.

356
00:29:31,875 --> 00:29:34,416
What about the prize winners?

357
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:37,041
There's a kid from Gurudaspur

358
00:29:37,166 --> 00:29:41,583
<span style="style.default_1">with his gym-body uncle.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">He's staring me down right now.</span>

359
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,375
<span style="style.default_1">I'm a stuntman!</span>

360
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:55,166
I have a new peon.
I'll send my cell phone with him.

361
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:56,500
-Okay?
-<span style="style.default_1">Yes.</span>

362
00:29:59,166 --> 00:30:01,708
<span style="style.default_1">-Why would he answer your call?</span>
-He will.

363
00:30:03,291 --> 00:30:05,333
<span style="style.default_1">So they gave you a peon?</span>

364
00:30:05,958 --> 00:30:06,958
Huh? Yeah.

365
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:10,541
<span style="style.default_1">Listen, at the end of their call,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">please talk to Karan</span>

366
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:11,833
and keep my cell phone with you.

367
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:14,166
I'll be there.

368
00:31:09,541 --> 00:31:10,875
What happened? Hello?

369
00:31:12,791 --> 00:31:14,833
I can't talk right now.

370
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:16,750
How can we not talk, huh?

371
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:20,000
I have a catastrophe happening
and I need your help.

372
00:31:20,416 --> 00:31:23,625
My catastrophe is bigger
than yours, get it?

373
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:28,958
Go to Radio City in BKC.
Ask for RJ Archana, okay?

374
00:31:29,041 --> 00:31:31,416
She has to call Karan Kapoor
from my phone.

375
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,291
<span style="style.default_1">Filmstar Karan Kapoor?</span>

376
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:36,291
Whose standee I was carting
around all morning.

377
00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:38,250
What do you do for him?

378
00:31:38,791 --> 00:31:39,708
PR.

379
00:31:39,791 --> 00:31:40,708
You love him?

380
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:44,333
Public relations, media, interview, radio.

381
00:31:46,958 --> 00:31:49,916
Well, uh, she's waiting for you
in Bandra Kurla, okay?

382
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,208
And what am I to you?

383
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:54,791
My beloved peon, Prem?

384
00:32:00,083 --> 00:32:03,000
Listen! You can choose a name for yourself
if you want. Hello.

385
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,125
<span style="style.default_1">Just help me.</span>

386
00:32:05,208 --> 00:32:06,875
What trap are you luring me into?

387
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:08,208
No trap, I swear.

388
00:32:09,208 --> 00:32:13,291
<span style="style.default_1">Two Punjabis won a prize to meet Karan.</span>

389
00:32:14,208 --> 00:32:17,875
A hit man is following me.
He kills people and uses their phones.

390
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:20,458
What crap is this?

391
00:32:22,625 --> 00:32:23,958
Tell me something.

392
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:26,041
Did you report your phone stolen?

393
00:32:28,166 --> 00:32:30,458
Who reports a stolen phone, stupid?

394
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,208
Where are you calling from?

395
00:32:32,291 --> 00:32:34,166
I'm at home and calling from my computer.

396
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:36,083
And whose cell phone did you use
to call me before?

397
00:32:36,666 --> 00:32:38,208
I told you it was my neighbor's phone.

398
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:39,708
<span style="style.default_1">What's all this?</span>

399
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:40,750
Boy or girl?

400
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,833
Girl.

401
00:32:43,916 --> 00:32:46,291
-Hmm. We'll see.
<span style="style.default_1">-What do you mean?</span>

402
00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:48,125
I'll dig out the number and call it.

403
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,083
She just left!

404
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:53,500
-Go, get her! I'm not sure I trust you.
-And what about my work?

405
00:32:53,583 --> 00:32:56,708
If I stay alive, we can discuss it.

406
00:32:56,791 --> 00:32:58,208
Listen to me. Hello?

407
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:41,583
Where are you from?

408
00:33:42,458 --> 00:33:43,541
Join me for a drink!

409
00:33:49,583 --> 00:33:52,208
I need to change my shirt
and you need to find a gift for a girl.

410
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:07,083
Something that says, um, you know,
"I'm sorry for today."

411
00:34:16,916 --> 00:34:18,166
Reclamation!

412
00:34:20,083 --> 00:34:21,958
Or shall we go wherever you're going?

413
00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:26,750
There's a quick update on Karan Kapoor.

414
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:28,666
He's not missing.

415
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:32,000
<span style="style.default_1">In fact, Mumbai, we're in touch</span>
<span style="style.default_1">with his PR team.</span>

416
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:35,833
That accident on set
was not life-threatening.

417
00:34:35,916 --> 00:34:38,750
Thank you so much for all your calls.

418
00:34:38,833 --> 00:34:40,791
We're making every effort

419
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:45,416
<span style="style.default_1">to connect Jazz and Balwinder</span>
<span style="style.default_1">with Karan Kapoor.</span>

420
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:56,000
Sir, Ms. Ira.

421
00:34:57,083 --> 00:34:58,291
Ignore her.

422
00:35:00,583 --> 00:35:01,916
Hand him your phone, now.

423
00:35:13,708 --> 00:35:15,458
Sorry, my phone was on silent mode.

424
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:18,333
What's this nonsense
about an accident on set?

425
00:35:18,958 --> 00:35:19,833
Which accident?

426
00:35:21,208 --> 00:35:22,833
What happened with the radio promo?

427
00:35:22,916 --> 00:35:24,166
I had to get away.

428
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:27,000
The PR guy you imposed
on me is a pothead.

429
00:35:28,541 --> 00:35:31,750
Mr. Wannabe Woody Allen
who thinks he can direct.

430
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:36,791
Listen, Karan, my campaign can't take
negative publicity, do you get it?

431
00:35:38,833 --> 00:35:40,125
Where are you?

432
00:35:40,625 --> 00:35:41,875
On a swan boat.

433
00:35:41,958 --> 00:35:43,083
National Park lake.

434
00:35:44,833 --> 00:35:46,708
-Are you alone?
-Raju's stuck to me.

435
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:49,041
I am not asking about him.

436
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:51,416
Send me a selfie

437
00:35:51,875 --> 00:35:53,125
<span style="style.default_1">from Swan lake.</span>

438
00:35:53,666 --> 00:35:55,291
Don't you trust me?

439
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,041
I'm not an idiot to trust you.

440
00:35:58,083 --> 00:36:02,125
Did you get the bottles of cologne
I sent you?

441
00:36:02,583 --> 00:36:06,875
My body's not in shape... anymore.

442
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:08,750
So drink less.

443
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:12,583
If you can't focus on our film,
at least focus on the election.

444
00:36:12,666 --> 00:36:14,083
I'm with you.

445
00:36:15,583 --> 00:36:18,750
I'm just trying to get my head together.

446
00:36:24,958 --> 00:36:26,083
Sir, don't!

447
00:36:26,541 --> 00:36:27,791
Pack up here!

448
00:36:28,041 --> 00:36:30,416
We're off to the lake to take a selfie!

449
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,166
Where were you?

450
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,791
-Sit!
-We'll talk later.

451
00:36:52,875 --> 00:36:54,833
-Why is your hat at that angle?
-I'm sitting.

452
00:36:54,916 --> 00:36:56,500
Mom, just chill.

453
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,791
We get around four of them daily.

454
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:13,750
But, sir, pink scooter.

455
00:37:16,833 --> 00:37:22,791
"Terror suspect, age 30,
pink scooter, checked shirt."

456
00:37:23,166 --> 00:37:25,000
Blah blah blah...

457
00:37:25,083 --> 00:37:28,333
"Last seen in Bandra.
CID Gujral."

458
00:37:38,791 --> 00:37:39,791
<span style="style.default_1">In our country</span>

459
00:37:39,875 --> 00:37:42,583
<span style="style.default_1">when a witness retracts their testimony</span>

460
00:37:42,708 --> 00:37:45,625
<span style="style.default_1">and becomes a hostile witness</span>

461
00:37:45,958 --> 00:37:49,625
<span style="style.default_1">that witness is in contempt of court.</span>

462
00:37:49,958 --> 00:37:53,750
<span style="style.default_1">In other words they risk</span>
<span style="style.default_1">seven years of imprisonment.</span>

463
00:37:53,833 --> 00:37:56,833
<span style="style.default_1">Now just think the amount of pressure</span>

464
00:37:56,916 --> 00:37:59,583
<span style="style.default_1">and intimidation they must be under</span>

465
00:37:59,666 --> 00:38:01,500
<span style="style.default_1">to take such a big risk.</span>

466
00:38:01,583 --> 00:38:03,125
-Is this shop yours?
-Hmm.

467
00:38:03,458 --> 00:38:05,458
Do you know how to operate this?
I need a number.

468
00:38:06,041 --> 00:38:07,125
Will you pay me for this?

469
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,833
Of course! Come out.

470
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:11,541
Whose number do you want?

471
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:13,916
His.

472
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,291
-Karan Kapoor's?
-Yes.

473
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:23,083
Write it on my hand.

474
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:27,291
<span style="style.default_1">Yet the law threatens to punish them.</span>

475
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,291
<span style="style.default_1">So just think!</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Is there any hope for justice?</span>

476
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:32,916
All I know is

477
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,416
he is at his computer day and night.

478
00:39:02,708 --> 00:39:05,875
Now he can stop dating girls.

479
00:39:05,958 --> 00:39:07,375
Mom! It's not for me!

480
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:24,416
Soon! Just...

481
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,500
It needs some investment.

482
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:41,958
Something that you like!

483
00:39:42,041 --> 00:39:42,916
Me?

484
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:54,125
We have an exchange policy!

485
00:39:59,416 --> 00:40:00,416
Hey, Pintu!

486
00:40:00,541 --> 00:40:02,041
Hey, Frederico!

487
00:40:02,625 --> 00:40:04,875
Oh, I'm-- Don't worry!
I'm with him!

488
00:40:05,041 --> 00:40:06,125
Uh...

489
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:17,791
Oh, uh...

490
00:40:17,875 --> 00:40:18,916
Guys, this is Meghna.

491
00:40:23,625 --> 00:40:24,458
Oh, Nandini!

492
00:40:28,875 --> 00:40:30,000
Did you run all the way here?

493
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:46,291
Okay, so when the call comes you've
to tell him that you're my neighbor.

494
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:47,958
Is she the same girl?

495
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:52,208
-Mom, what are you...
-Who did this to you?

496
00:40:52,291 --> 00:40:53,125
Leave it!

497
00:41:07,083 --> 00:41:08,791
Yeah, Meghna's neighbor speaking.

498
00:41:08,875 --> 00:41:11,125
This guy's still after you?

499
00:41:11,833 --> 00:41:12,875
Uh...

500
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:16,208
Oh, you gave her phone to her peon?

501
00:41:17,416 --> 00:41:19,166
That's why you're calling from a PCO?

502
00:41:20,166 --> 00:41:21,416
Yeah, I get it.

503
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:26,333
Why? Why should I give her my phone?

504
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,125
Oh, just till 8:30?

505
00:41:31,666 --> 00:41:33,333
What's this about 8:30?

506
00:41:33,416 --> 00:41:35,125
I'll tell you later.

507
00:41:35,208 --> 00:41:37,041
I have Karan Kapoor's number.
Note it down.

508
00:41:37,125 --> 00:41:38,833
<span style="style.default_1">Hold on. Did I ask you for that?</span>

509
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:40,083
No, right?

510
00:41:40,166 --> 00:41:41,875
I asked you to go to Radio City.

511
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:45,041
And I decided to check out
your PCO story first.

512
00:41:45,791 --> 00:41:47,958
The little guy remembers you well.
Who's this?

513
00:41:48,041 --> 00:41:50,666
-The woman in the white sari.
-And what did you find?

514
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,458
-Video.
-Hit delete then.

515
00:41:52,541 --> 00:41:54,291
What are you doing?
That's my private video!

516
00:41:54,375 --> 00:41:55,375
What's the big deal?

517
00:41:55,458 --> 00:41:57,083
We will have to rectify your mistake.

518
00:41:57,166 --> 00:41:58,041
Deleted!

519
00:41:58,125 --> 00:42:01,083
Try acting less smart
and you won't land in trouble.

520
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:05,125
<span style="style.default_1">Happy Holi, bless the blouse-less!</span>

521
00:42:07,583 --> 00:42:08,583
<span style="style.default_1">Karan!</span>

522
00:42:08,666 --> 00:42:10,416
<span style="style.default_1">I need to take my paint off, please, baby!</span>

523
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,333
What's all this?

524
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,583
-You're too young to watch this.
<span style="style.default_1">-Pervert!</span>

525
00:42:17,083 --> 00:42:18,541
<span style="style.default_1">Let's click a sexy selfie.</span>

526
00:42:18,625 --> 00:42:20,750
<span style="style.default_1">-Karan! Give me the shower curtain!</span>
-Baby.

527
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:26,958
<span style="style.default_1">-Jerk!</span>
<span style="style.default_1">-Turn it off!</span>

528
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:29,041
<span style="style.default_1">Don't just turn it off. Delete it!</span>

529
00:42:32,791 --> 00:42:35,875
Madam, we will delete it.
Just not today.

530
00:42:36,375 --> 00:42:38,583
Until our jobs are done,

531
00:42:38,875 --> 00:42:41,833
I'll be your beloved peon Prem.
Do you get it?

532
00:42:41,916 --> 00:42:43,166
Why are you doing all this?

533
00:42:44,083 --> 00:42:45,208
What have I done?

534
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:48,416
You're going to look after me,
and I'm going to look after you. Okay?

535
00:42:55,708 --> 00:42:56,875
I just spoke to my brother-in-law.

536
00:42:57,916 --> 00:42:59,333
He's wanted for murder.

537
00:43:21,458 --> 00:43:22,458
Enough of this.

538
00:43:22,541 --> 00:43:24,041
Why are you leaving?

539
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:27,541
Your son is thinking about something else.
There's no point lingering!

540
00:43:34,708 --> 00:43:36,625
At least pay for what you ordered!

541
00:43:36,708 --> 00:43:38,750
-Pintu, do something!
-No, no, no!

542
00:43:44,125 --> 00:43:45,500
You expect us to pay!

543
00:43:57,375 --> 00:43:59,875
find-a-boy
find-a-boy idiocity, okay?

544
00:44:33,416 --> 00:44:34,291
Give me some more.

545
00:44:34,375 --> 00:44:36,541
Have I opened a bank here? Huh?

546
00:44:36,625 --> 00:44:39,250
Sir, checked shirt! Checked shirt!

547
00:44:40,125 --> 00:44:42,291
Sir, catch him! Terrorist!

548
00:44:46,916 --> 00:44:49,541
Hey, you! Stop!

549
00:44:49,625 --> 00:44:51,250
Move it!

550
00:44:53,125 --> 00:44:54,583
You got him!

551
00:45:06,666 --> 00:45:07,916
What was the number?

552
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:12,583
Why did you let him go?

553
00:45:12,666 --> 00:45:16,208
MH03 YY...

554
00:45:16,666 --> 00:45:19,291
-Faster, Pintu, they're getting away!
-No, let's go back!

555
00:45:19,375 --> 00:45:22,208
I had to pay the whole bill,
and I also left my glasses.

556
00:45:22,291 --> 00:45:25,041
Dad, you can buy new glasses.
My hat is irreplaceable.

557
00:45:25,125 --> 00:45:28,041
Oh, Hatman. Where's your priority, lad?

558
00:45:28,541 --> 00:45:31,041
-Hatman?
-Hasn't he told you?

559
00:45:31,125 --> 00:45:33,500
From the age of five
he's been a crime fighter

560
00:45:33,583 --> 00:45:34,875
wearing different headgear.

561
00:45:34,958 --> 00:45:38,083
-As a child he made me tell stories.
-Hatman.

562
00:45:38,166 --> 00:45:39,833
Hatman in the jungle...

563
00:45:39,916 --> 00:45:41,708
-saving animals from evil-doers.
-Mom!

564
00:45:42,541 --> 00:45:43,500
What?

565
00:45:43,583 --> 00:45:45,666
You were such a cute child, Pintu.

566
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:47,666
-Now he'll go prematurely bald.
-Pintu.

567
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:49,000
Just like me.

568
00:45:49,083 --> 00:45:51,041
From excessive hat wearing.

569
00:45:51,125 --> 00:45:52,125
-I need to get out of here!
-Okay!

570
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:53,416
Does she want to escape now?

571
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,250
No, I just need to meet my peon.

572
00:45:55,333 --> 00:45:59,583
You can't go till we find out
all about you.

573
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
You love my son,
and that's why you keep harassing him.

574
00:46:03,083 --> 00:46:06,291
-What's this rubbish?
-She's more in love with Nandini.

575
00:46:06,375 --> 00:46:07,291
-Huh?
-What?

576
00:46:07,375 --> 00:46:08,291
I witnessed it.

577
00:46:21,333 --> 00:46:22,750
What's this peck?

578
00:46:23,666 --> 00:46:24,583
Not here.

579
00:46:24,666 --> 00:46:27,208
No, no, Nandini gave her a smacker!

580
00:46:27,291 --> 00:46:29,958
Aunty, Nandini is a lesbian, not me.

581
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,291
What's a lesbian?

582
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:35,708
Nothing, Mom, don't worry about it.

583
00:46:40,708 --> 00:46:42,583
Yeah, so listen! I mean, uh...

584
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:46,333
You know Bhagirath, who brought
the Ganges from heaven.

585
00:46:47,791 --> 00:46:50,625
-Everyone knows except Godless men.
-Yeah, correct so...

586
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:56,125
Bhagirath had two mothers.
He had no father.

587
00:46:56,541 --> 00:47:01,041
-That's right, no father.
-So Nandini is like one of his mothers!

588
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:06,666
She has saved our son.

589
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,625
Sing with me, child.

590
00:47:11,708 --> 00:47:13,625
-Huh? No, no.
-Sing along.

591
00:47:13,708 --> 00:47:17,458
<span style="style.default_1">O daughter of Bhagirath!</span>

592
00:47:17,541 --> 00:47:21,458
<span style="style.default_1">O daughter of Bhagirath!</span>

593
00:47:21,541 --> 00:47:25,541
<span style="style.default_1">You are like the moonbeams</span>
<span style="style.default_1">For numerous sages</span>

<span style="style.default_1">Humans, serpents and gods pray to you</span>

595
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:33,708
<span style="style.default_1">Daughter of Jahnu</span>

596
00:47:33,791 --> 00:47:37,041
<span style="style.default_1">O daughter of Bhagirath!</span>

597
00:47:37,708 --> 00:47:40,708
<span style="style.default_1">O daughter of Bhagirath!</span>

598
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:41,875
It must be brother-in-law.

599
00:47:45,375 --> 00:47:46,416
Hey, Uncle!

600
00:47:47,958 --> 00:47:50,125
<span style="style.default_1">Hello, dear,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">this is Meghna's granny.</span>

601
00:47:50,208 --> 00:47:53,500
<span style="style.default_1">I didn't want to disturb you.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">There's one way to be sure.</span>

602
00:47:53,583 --> 00:47:55,458
<span style="style.default_1">Get her pregnancy test done.</span>

603
00:47:58,708 --> 00:48:03,458
<span style="style.default_1">I won't tell Papa till we know</span>
<span style="style.default_1">it's positive or negative. Okay?</span>

604
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:04,583
Okay.

605
00:48:04,666 --> 00:48:06,166
<span style="style.default_1">-Okay, bye!</span>
-Bye bye.

606
00:48:06,625 --> 00:48:07,541
Who was it, Dad?

607
00:48:07,625 --> 00:48:09,958
You keep your eyes
on the road, Hatman.

608
00:48:10,291 --> 00:48:14,375
-And watch out for the bumps.
-Sing with me, child. Sing loudly.

609
00:48:18,875 --> 00:48:20,708
What's the fuss about the scooter?

610
00:48:20,791 --> 00:48:22,708
It belongs to some Prerna Mathur.

611
00:48:24,333 --> 00:48:25,208
Sing, child!

612
00:48:28,916 --> 00:48:31,875
-And who is Prerna Mathur?
<span style="style.default_1">-I'm looking into it.</span>

613
00:48:32,375 --> 00:48:35,416
The scooter was sighted
in Mahim near a police station.

614
00:48:35,833 --> 00:48:37,041
<span style="style.default_1">Get over there.</span>

615
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:38,458
End this.

616
00:48:42,958 --> 00:48:44,583
Hey. Get me a glass of chilled water.

617
00:48:45,583 --> 00:48:46,541
Cold...

618
00:48:47,708 --> 00:48:49,333
You'll find it in the fridge.

619
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:57,750
<span style="style.default_1">Daughter of Jahnu</span>

620
00:48:57,833 --> 00:49:00,583
Chacha had connections all over the city.

621
00:49:00,916 --> 00:49:03,333
<span style="style.default_1">It may not be as easy as we think it is.</span>

622
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,416
There are two things about this city
that you need to keep in mind.

623
00:49:08,125 --> 00:49:12,000
<span style="style.default_1">Property prices per square foot</span>
<span style="style.default_1">are highest in the world.</span>

624
00:49:12,083 --> 00:49:15,208
Pintu, we should go to the temple.

625
00:49:20,083 --> 00:49:21,750
also are highest in the world.

626
00:49:22,083 --> 00:49:25,625
<span style="style.default_1">O daughter of Bhagirath!</span>

627
00:49:26,083 --> 00:49:27,333
That's for sure.

628
00:49:30,166 --> 00:49:36,125
<span style="style.default_1">You are like the moonbeams</span>
<span style="style.default_1">For numerous sages</span>

629
00:50:17,041 --> 00:50:19,708
Borivali National Park?
What is he doing there?

630
00:50:19,791 --> 00:50:22,625
Nothing. He is just sad
and is thinking about you.

631
00:50:23,041 --> 00:50:24,333
I can't come.

632
00:50:24,416 --> 00:50:26,708
Listen! We're a team now!

633
00:50:26,791 --> 00:50:29,458
Don't make me threaten you!

634
00:50:30,583 --> 00:50:31,583
Okay, I'll come.

635
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:35,250
Oh.

636
00:50:43,375 --> 00:50:44,625
What happened?

637
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:47,416
We're such idiots.

638
00:50:47,833 --> 00:50:48,750
What?

639
00:50:51,041 --> 00:50:53,791
You're not my second choice, child.

640
00:50:53,875 --> 00:50:56,416
If only we'd known about you before

641
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,833
none of this would have happened.

642
00:50:58,083 --> 00:50:59,833
Where in this rotten world

643
00:50:59,916 --> 00:51:05,041
is such a beautiful, pure
and pious girl to be found?

644
00:51:19,166 --> 00:51:20,458
What do you mean?

645
00:51:22,541 --> 00:51:24,125
with your mom in that state?

646
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:28,458
Where do you want to go?
Do you want to go up?

647
00:51:28,541 --> 00:51:31,750
Place the altar! I'm ready!

648
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,291
Really, Pintu, you're ready?

649
00:51:36,666 --> 00:51:40,125
If she wants to have a family with you,
marry her.

650
00:51:44,291 --> 00:51:47,875
Do you even care
if she doesn't like me?

651
00:51:52,208 --> 00:51:55,166
Do you know where your logic leads us?

652
00:51:56,666 --> 00:51:58,125
-First, we'd get married.
-Yeah.

653
00:51:58,208 --> 00:51:59,708
Then that child gets a Dad.

654
00:52:01,541 --> 00:52:03,791
Yes! That kid will need a father.

655
00:52:05,458 --> 00:52:06,916
I might be infertile.

656
00:52:15,958 --> 00:52:18,291
I just let you think that to escape.

657
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:28,250
<span style="style.default_1">Sir, we found two phone numbers</span>
<span style="style.default_1">on the police report.</span>

658
00:52:28,583 --> 00:52:30,625
<span style="style.default_1">They're both being tapped now.</span>

659
00:52:31,041 --> 00:52:33,416
<span style="style.default_1">There's a meeting in National Park</span>

660
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:35,833
<span style="style.default_1">-with Karan Kapoor.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">-Who?</span>

661
00:52:36,291 --> 00:52:38,458
<span style="style.default_1">Bollywood actor, Karan Kapoor.</span>

662
00:52:38,916 --> 00:52:40,625
Who got the Bollywood involved?

663
00:52:40,833 --> 00:52:45,833
Guess what! Tell the prize winners
Karan is treating them to lunch.

664
00:52:46,833 --> 00:52:48,375
They must be hungry.

665
00:52:48,625 --> 00:52:49,666
I'm hungry too.

666
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:52,291
Oh, yeah, you're included.
Eat with them.

667
00:52:52,375 --> 00:52:55,916
And keep the bill.
I'll pay you when I see you.

668
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,416
I need to fix Karan's mood.

669
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:04,750
-Okay, just don't keep us hanging.
-Of course. Wait there! Bye.

670
00:53:19,833 --> 00:53:20,833
Raju!

671
00:53:29,583 --> 00:53:30,708
Hop in the back.

672
00:53:31,083 --> 00:53:32,541
Sir, I'll drive.

673
00:53:34,125 --> 00:53:35,916
Please let him drive.

674
00:53:39,458 --> 00:53:40,291
Quickly now.

675
00:53:40,375 --> 00:53:41,541
Hey, listen.

676
00:53:42,083 --> 00:53:43,916
I'll wait here for your peon.

677
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,416
No, no, no!

678
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:46,375
Uh...

679
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:11,500
Let's go.

680
00:54:11,833 --> 00:54:13,208
Open the barrier!

681
00:54:18,875 --> 00:54:21,583
Sorry, sir. Mr. Karan sprayed
too much perfume on me.

682
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,125
Abhishek Sharma?

683
00:54:56,541 --> 00:54:57,625
<span style="style.default_1">Who's this?</span>

684
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,625
Inspector Gujral, CID.

685
00:55:01,541 --> 00:55:04,041
Is this about the guy who is wanted?

686
00:55:04,125 --> 00:55:08,041
Right, I read your crime report.

687
00:55:08,416 --> 00:55:11,083
Sir, my description is 100% accurate.

688
00:55:11,166 --> 00:55:12,583
I need to ask you something.

689
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:17,083
Have you seen Meghna Shergill's peon?

690
00:55:17,166 --> 00:55:19,083
No, sir. Not as yet.

691
00:55:19,458 --> 00:55:22,166
<span style="style.default_1">Are you aware that</span>
<span style="style.default_1">she trashed your report?</span>

692
00:55:22,875 --> 00:55:23,875
What?

693
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:28,458
I wasn't aware of that, sir.

694
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:37,250
Give it to Abhishek.

695
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:38,958
And make sure
he stays over there, okay?

696
00:55:44,041 --> 00:55:46,125
Didn't you turn celibate?

697
00:55:46,208 --> 00:55:49,541
Yeah, I tried to, three times.
Today was the fourth time I went there,

698
00:55:49,666 --> 00:55:51,583
but the Cosmos had different plans.

699
00:55:51,666 --> 00:55:54,958
What Cosmos, what plans?
What nonsense! Come on!

700
00:55:55,041 --> 00:55:58,125
Guess what I was doing
before your ego summoned me here.

701
00:55:59,666 --> 00:56:01,958
Tell me. What were you doing?

702
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,458
I can't hear you.
Come into the swan.

703
00:56:06,541 --> 00:56:07,375
No one will come.

704
00:56:07,458 --> 00:56:09,208
-Come to me.
-No, no!

705
00:56:14,208 --> 00:56:15,208
Yeah...

706
00:56:15,625 --> 00:56:18,750
-I often think of those times...
-Yeah?

707
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:22,041
So I thought of giving
you a small funeral.

708
00:56:23,416 --> 00:56:25,041
I'll organize a small funeral for you!

709
00:56:25,125 --> 00:56:26,000
Psst!

710
00:56:26,333 --> 00:56:27,375
Raju!

711
00:56:31,125 --> 00:56:32,708
It cleanses you.

712
00:56:37,291 --> 00:56:40,500
And sometimes eliminate them
which is why a funeral was required.

713
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:44,458
<span style="style.default_1">Not a real funeral,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">it was just your standee.</span>

714
00:56:47,291 --> 00:56:49,500
<span style="style.default_1">I wore my mom's sari.</span>

715
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:51,833
Of course, in your honor

716
00:56:53,791 --> 00:56:55,333
<span style="style.default_1">But they found it too glam.</span>

717
00:56:55,458 --> 00:56:58,000
<span style="style.default_1">So I'm rejecting both of you</span>

718
00:57:06,666 --> 00:57:08,208
I'm not in love with you.

719
00:57:10,416 --> 00:57:12,500
<span style="style.default_1">And so, I was saying</span>
<span style="style.default_1">goodbye to your standee</span>

720
00:57:12,583 --> 00:57:15,166
<span style="style.default_1">when some slum kids chased me</span>

721
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:17,208
<span style="style.default_1">for burning a demigod!</span>

722
00:57:19,333 --> 00:57:20,250
Sometimes in life...

723
00:57:23,833 --> 00:57:24,916
So I got in a rickshaw,

724
00:57:30,125 --> 00:57:33,583
you took of me at Holi in the shower
washing off color?

725
00:57:42,166 --> 00:57:43,041
Such as?

726
00:57:43,166 --> 00:57:45,125
Such as, I thought I looked good in it!

727
00:57:49,625 --> 00:57:50,833
What is it, Raju?

728
00:57:50,916 --> 00:57:53,958
Sir says the CID want your phone.

729
00:57:54,041 --> 00:57:54,916
CID?

730
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,708
An inspector is on his way.

731
00:57:58,916 --> 00:58:00,875
-Tell him I'm coming!
-Sure.

732
00:58:02,416 --> 00:58:04,416
The guy who has my phone...

733
00:58:05,666 --> 00:58:07,791
Is he the one who called me?

734
00:58:07,875 --> 00:58:10,291
Yeah, I had to give him a job.

735
00:58:13,916 --> 00:58:15,083
Has he seen the clip?

736
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,291
Meghu, why didn't you delete it?

737
00:58:21,375 --> 00:58:23,833
I was going to,
after your funeral!

738
00:58:24,583 --> 00:58:26,625
If CID finds the clip

739
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,041
your career is over.

740
00:58:29,125 --> 00:58:31,875
Forget me!
You're just wearing paint!

741
00:58:31,958 --> 00:58:33,000
Where are these people?

742
00:58:33,708 --> 00:58:35,791
<span style="style.default_1">I parked them in a restaurant.</span>

743
00:58:37,125 --> 00:58:38,083
Meghu...

744
00:58:41,916 --> 00:58:45,125
I've never seen such a crazy girl!
Why doesn't this move?

745
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,291
That's quite a big bill,
it includes the hats too.

746
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:02,833
Are you feeling better, baby?

747
00:59:03,291 --> 00:59:05,333
Ya! I suddenly got a spurt of energy!

748
00:59:05,958 --> 00:59:07,375
Is it from the lake breeze?

749
00:59:07,458 --> 00:59:08,458
Yeah, yeah!

750
00:59:11,291 --> 00:59:12,208
Really?

751
00:59:12,833 --> 00:59:15,208
Sorry, I was moody before.

752
00:59:18,208 --> 00:59:21,291
Listen, I'm off to meet
those prize winners now.

753
00:59:25,208 --> 00:59:26,583
Oh, you're coming!

754
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,416
Missing you, a tad.

755
00:59:49,291 --> 00:59:52,083
You forgot about us
so we set out from Zapata's!

756
00:59:52,166 --> 00:59:53,666
How could we forget you?

757
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:57,083
Are you near the park?
I'd love to meet you.

758
00:59:57,416 --> 00:59:58,791
Sorry, what's your name?

759
01:00:00,291 --> 01:00:01,291
Prem?

760
01:00:02,041 --> 01:00:03,958
Wow! Fit for a hero!

761
01:00:05,333 --> 01:00:06,375
And you?

762
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:09,416
I'm Abhishek.
Meghna is with Karan.

763
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:12,125
Bring the prize winners to the gate.

764
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:14,041
CID needs to check Meghna's phone.

765
01:00:14,875 --> 01:00:16,000
Did you say CID?

766
01:00:16,416 --> 01:00:20,500
Don't worry. They want her
call records and that video.

767
01:00:22,666 --> 01:00:23,708
<span style="style.default_1">Yes, the video.</span>

768
01:00:24,083 --> 01:00:25,958
I hope the video
is still there on the phone.

769
01:00:26,333 --> 01:00:27,791
Are you this shameless?

770
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:31,750
What's shame got to do with it?

771
01:00:31,833 --> 01:00:34,291
<span style="style.default_1">It's police procedure, that's all.</span>

772
01:00:34,625 --> 01:00:37,833
I'll not talk to anyone but madam, okay?

773
01:00:40,708 --> 01:00:42,583
What the hell is going on?

774
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,375
Bossy peon, man.

775
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:56,166
Hey, hold on!

776
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:57,375
Where are you going?

777
01:00:57,458 --> 01:00:59,625
Why is peon Prem so confused?

778
01:01:01,708 --> 01:01:02,916
You hurry home.

779
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:03,875
What do you mean?

780
01:01:13,708 --> 01:01:15,125
Karan, we're reaching.

781
01:01:15,208 --> 01:01:18,375
No, no, no!
Meet us in Film City, not the park.

782
01:01:18,458 --> 01:01:19,666
CID are coming!

783
01:01:20,541 --> 01:01:21,958
Turn around!

784
01:01:22,833 --> 01:01:23,750
Go back!

785
01:01:23,833 --> 01:01:26,041
Fraud. I'm going to continue driving.

786
01:01:28,833 --> 01:01:32,291
Just remember, I've done what
you asked. Now it's your turn!

787
01:01:32,375 --> 01:01:34,541
What do want from me?

788
01:01:34,875 --> 01:01:37,500
You don't want your scooter
from these guys?

789
01:01:37,583 --> 01:01:40,208
Scooter? Which scooter?

790
01:01:40,791 --> 01:01:41,916
Hey.

791
01:01:42,375 --> 01:01:44,625
-Is this for Karan Kapoor?
-Yes, he ordered us to do this.

792
01:01:44,708 --> 01:01:46,416
Stop honking! Shut it!

793
01:01:48,375 --> 01:01:49,541
I've got this.

794
01:01:52,416 --> 01:01:54,041
Stop. Stop here.

795
01:02:04,708 --> 01:02:05,916
You want to meet Karan, don't you, Jazz?

796
01:02:06,041 --> 01:02:07,291
-Karan!
-Yeah.

797
01:02:07,958 --> 01:02:09,666
Sir has to rush to set.

798
01:02:12,625 --> 01:02:13,666
Over here, ma'am.

799
01:02:18,208 --> 01:02:20,250
-Prerna, who?
-Mathur.

800
01:02:20,541 --> 01:02:22,000
I've never heard of her.

801
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,083
I need to meet your peon, right now.

802
01:02:24,416 --> 01:02:25,458
You...

803
01:03:01,458 --> 01:03:03,291
He's here! Peon.

804
01:03:03,375 --> 01:03:04,875
-This is--
-Yes, he is my peon.

805
01:03:07,875 --> 01:03:10,958
-Fiancé?
-Go home! I asked you to leave.

806
01:03:11,291 --> 01:03:14,083
Meghna Ma'am? Your phone.

807
01:03:16,458 --> 01:03:19,208
I got my phone back,
from my peon.

808
01:03:21,458 --> 01:03:22,333
Why?

809
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:24,833
-The bill for lunch.
-Oh.

810
01:03:24,916 --> 01:03:26,958
Who gave you this?
The guy on the scooter?

811
01:03:28,583 --> 01:03:29,708
The guy on the scooter.

812
01:03:30,625 --> 01:03:32,375
-Where is he?
-I'm the peon.

813
01:03:32,541 --> 01:03:33,375
Huh?

814
01:03:33,458 --> 01:03:34,958
Thank you, sir, she has her phone.

815
01:03:35,041 --> 01:03:37,083
I'll ask Mrs. Angre to get you promoted.

816
01:03:38,458 --> 01:03:39,333
Mr. Karan.

817
01:03:44,333 --> 01:03:48,208
There's a hitman after me.
He kills people and uses their phones.

818
01:03:49,916 --> 01:03:50,833
Let's go, Meghu.

819
01:03:53,916 --> 01:03:56,958
I need to tell Ma'am something else.
What if I get whacked?

820
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:58,291
What else?

821
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,041
Unblock the road!

822
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,250
You come with us.

823
01:04:04,333 --> 01:04:05,333
Meghu, let's go!

824
01:04:06,583 --> 01:04:08,833
-One minute! This is evidence.
-Hey!

825
01:04:09,708 --> 01:04:11,500
Give me something.

826
01:04:11,583 --> 01:04:13,291
-Take my card.
-Give it.

827
01:04:41,833 --> 01:04:42,875
Hey!

828
01:04:43,416 --> 01:04:45,458
-That was a superb stunt!
-Get out!

829
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:46,583
Out I said!

830
01:04:47,416 --> 01:04:48,250
Step aside, Dummy!

831
01:04:48,333 --> 01:04:50,083
What did you call my nephew?

832
01:04:50,166 --> 01:04:51,041
Get out!

833
01:04:51,125 --> 01:04:52,666
-No, brother, don't!
-Get out!

834
01:04:54,375 --> 01:04:56,083
Hey! What did you say?

835
01:04:56,458 --> 01:04:58,250
Hands up! Hands up!

836
01:04:58,333 --> 01:04:59,250
Who are you freaks?

837
01:04:59,666 --> 01:05:02,041
The wife you banged was
like a car to me, sir.

838
01:05:02,125 --> 01:05:02,958
Who are they?

839
01:05:03,083 --> 01:05:04,458
-Where's the camera?
-They're prize winners!

840
01:05:04,541 --> 01:05:07,500
Prize winners who won a stupid scooter.

841
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:09,375
They're just fans. Case closed.

842
01:05:09,458 --> 01:05:11,041
-What are you doing?
-Sir, one minute!

843
01:05:11,125 --> 01:05:14,000
My peon here was simply delivering it.

844
01:05:14,083 --> 01:05:15,666
You just told us he's your peon.

845
01:05:16,875 --> 01:05:19,375
There's a new peon for a new day.
That's the film industry!

846
01:05:19,458 --> 01:05:21,833
How long have these delivery guys
been working for you?

847
01:05:21,916 --> 01:05:23,541
-One month!
-Shut up.

848
01:05:23,625 --> 01:05:26,875
-I'm talking to her. Quiet!
-Correct, sir. It's been a month.

849
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:30,750
-Sharma! Lock him in the jeep.
-Huh, me?

850
01:05:33,291 --> 01:05:35,291
You might be helping the wrong guy!

851
01:05:41,083 --> 01:05:44,375
Sir, sir, my phone. I will vouch for him.

852
01:05:45,333 --> 01:05:46,416
-Really?
-Yes.

853
01:05:46,958 --> 01:05:48,875
Then you'd have to come along.

854
01:05:49,166 --> 01:05:51,875
-Sharma! Take her into custody.
-What?

855
01:05:51,958 --> 01:05:54,333
-How am I involved?
-Move it, Miss.

856
01:05:54,416 --> 01:05:55,833
Give me my phone, please.

857
01:05:58,916 --> 01:06:00,083
What's got into you?

858
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,833
I'm in love with you, you idiot!

859
01:06:02,916 --> 01:06:04,166
Is that your fiancé?

860
01:06:04,708 --> 01:06:07,791
You can lock her up, and I'll get her out!

861
01:06:10,208 --> 01:06:13,208
-You don't know me!
-Of course, I do.

862
01:06:13,291 --> 01:06:15,791
I wish I could be reborn
with your face.

863
01:06:16,125 --> 01:06:18,750
What's your badge number?
Which station are you from?

864
01:06:19,291 --> 01:06:20,375
Here's my badge.

865
01:06:20,458 --> 01:06:22,208
-Please, sir, let's move.
-Back away.

866
01:06:22,291 --> 01:06:23,791
Hey, Raju! Give me my phone!

867
01:06:24,625 --> 01:06:25,958
I'm going.

868
01:06:26,041 --> 01:06:28,000
-You'll be hearing from me!
-Step away!

869
01:06:28,208 --> 01:06:29,958
Call the Commissioner.

870
01:06:30,208 --> 01:06:32,958
It's a Maruti gypsy. 6881.

871
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:35,833
You forgot about me?

872
01:06:36,333 --> 01:06:39,208
No, no, there's definitely
a Karan Kapoor connection.

873
01:06:39,416 --> 01:06:40,500
Well...

874
01:06:41,208 --> 01:06:43,708
Does the stolen phone
have a video on it...

875
01:06:44,958 --> 01:06:46,875
that's got everyone excited?

876
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:48,791
Is that so?

877
01:07:02,250 --> 01:07:04,250
<span style="style.default_1">Happy Holi, bless the blouse-less!</span>

878
01:07:08,208 --> 01:07:10,666
<span style="style.default_1">I need to take my paint off. Please, baby!</span>

879
01:07:12,875 --> 01:07:15,375
<span style="style.default_1">You're filming with my phone,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">you idiot. Pervert.</span>

880
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:17,875
<span style="style.default_1">Let's take a sexy selfie.</span>

881
01:07:17,958 --> 01:07:19,083
<span style="style.default_1">Come on. Baby.</span>

882
01:07:19,166 --> 01:07:20,291
<span style="style.default_1">Give me the shower curtain.</span>

883
01:07:26,041 --> 01:07:28,541
<span style="style.default_1">You are so beautiful, Meghu!</span>

884
01:07:49,708 --> 01:07:51,791
Hello? Commissioner, this is Karan here.

885
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Step out.

886
01:08:26,166 --> 01:08:27,291
Don't try to run.

887
01:08:40,333 --> 01:08:41,791
Who is Prerna Mathur?

888
01:08:45,083 --> 01:08:46,125
No idea.

889
01:08:47,041 --> 01:08:47,958
Hmm.

890
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:50,125
Did you steal the scooter?

891
01:08:51,541 --> 01:08:52,500
Did you?

892
01:08:53,083 --> 01:08:53,958
Yeah.

893
01:08:57,333 --> 01:08:59,166
What's in the parcel?

894
01:09:00,666 --> 01:09:01,625
I don't know.

895
01:09:05,041 --> 01:09:07,375
-Where is the parcel?
-I don't know.

896
01:09:07,458 --> 01:09:08,500
Where is the parcel?

897
01:09:08,583 --> 01:09:09,625
I've no clue.

898
01:09:10,083 --> 01:09:13,541
Don't shoot! She doesn't know anything.

899
01:09:13,625 --> 01:09:15,166
If you shoot her,
I won't tell you anything.

900
01:09:15,250 --> 01:09:17,166
You're threatening me?

901
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:19,416
It's by Chacha's place!

902
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:20,791
I already searched his place!

903
01:09:20,875 --> 01:09:23,083
You need to take me with you.

904
01:09:23,166 --> 01:09:25,208
Please, just let her go!

905
01:09:32,458 --> 01:09:33,625
Say goodbye.

906
01:09:53,833 --> 01:09:57,208
Of course, it was a stunt, Jazz.
I was acting too.

907
01:09:57,458 --> 01:10:00,500
This is Filmcity.
People shoot here.

908
01:10:04,791 --> 01:10:07,541
<span style="style.default_1">My beloved</span>

909
01:10:10,125 --> 01:10:14,083
<span style="style.default_1">My darling</span>

910
01:10:15,916 --> 01:10:18,291
<span style="style.default_1">My beloved</span>

911
01:10:21,708 --> 01:10:23,583
<span style="style.default_1">My darling</span>

912
01:10:23,666 --> 01:10:26,250
Meghna ma'am!
Are you done with the shooting?

913
01:10:27,083 --> 01:10:29,250
<span style="style.default_1">Must you leave me</span>

914
01:10:32,333 --> 01:10:33,750
<span style="style.default_1">Drop the scooter there.</span>

915
01:10:37,875 --> 01:10:40,625
<span style="style.default_1">I've bound myself to you</span>

916
01:10:40,708 --> 01:10:43,416
<span style="style.default_1">I've drowned myself in you</span>

917
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:46,208
<span style="style.default_1">I've bound myself to you</span>

918
01:10:46,333 --> 01:10:49,000
<span style="style.default_1">I've drowned myself in you</span>

919
01:10:49,083 --> 01:10:51,833
<span style="style.default_1">I've bound myself to you</span>

920
01:10:51,916 --> 01:10:54,583
<span style="style.default_1">I've drowned myself in you</span>

921
01:10:54,666 --> 01:10:57,375
<span style="style.default_1">I've bound myself to you</span>

922
01:10:57,458 --> 01:11:00,208
<span style="style.default_1">I've drowned myself in you</span>

923
01:11:00,458 --> 01:11:03,625
<span style="style.default_1">Are we enemies?</span>

924
01:11:05,833 --> 01:11:09,125
<span style="style.default_1">Must we remain so?</span>

925
01:11:11,916 --> 01:11:16,208
<span style="style.default_1">Are we on the path of hope?</span>

926
01:11:39,666 --> 01:11:42,208
<span style="style.default_1">My beloved</span>

927
01:11:45,041 --> 01:11:48,833
<span style="style.default_1">My darling</span>

928
01:11:50,875 --> 01:11:53,041
<span style="style.default_1">My beloved</span>

929
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:59,666
<span style="style.default_1">My darling</span>

930
01:12:01,958 --> 01:12:04,208
<span style="style.default_1">Must you leave me</span>

931
01:12:07,416 --> 01:12:11,916
<span style="style.default_1">After all you have seen</span>

932
01:12:12,791 --> 01:12:15,541
<span style="style.default_1">I've bound myself to you</span>

933
01:12:15,625 --> 01:12:18,333
<span style="style.default_1">I've drowned myself in you</span>

934
01:12:18,416 --> 01:12:21,125
<span style="style.default_1">I've bound myself to you</span>

935
01:12:21,250 --> 01:12:23,833
<span style="style.default_1">I've drowned myself in you</span>

936
01:12:23,916 --> 01:12:26,666
<span style="style.default_1">I've bound myself to you</span>

937
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:29,500
<span style="style.default_1">I've drowned myself in you</span>

938
01:12:29,708 --> 01:12:32,333
<span style="style.default_1">I've bound myself to you</span>

939
01:12:32,416 --> 01:12:35,208
<span style="style.default_1">I've drowned myself in you</span>

940
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,083
How many times do I need to tell you?
Do you want to blow us up with your phone?

941
01:12:44,708 --> 01:12:47,916
<span style="style.default_1">Son, go to Meghna's flat</span>
<span style="style.default_1">right away. Papa is there.</span>

942
01:12:48,333 --> 01:12:50,250
Papa? Papa is in Mumbai?

943
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,041
Gujral!

944
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,625
Deputy Home Minister Irawati
can easily unmask this witness!

945
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:39,375
Use that video Karan took to put
the squeeze on her ladyship, hello!

946
01:13:50,291 --> 01:13:53,375
Please tell me you've noted
Gujral's badge number and his station.

947
01:13:53,875 --> 01:13:54,833
Hey, Dheere!

948
01:13:55,125 --> 01:13:56,541
What's Gujral's badge number?

949
01:13:56,625 --> 01:13:57,833
I didn't take it.

950
01:13:58,250 --> 01:13:59,125
<span style="style.default_1">Why not?</span>

951
01:14:02,958 --> 01:14:04,916
We need to involve
the Police Commissioner.

952
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,375
He's bound to know something.

953
01:14:06,875 --> 01:14:08,625
After Karan Kapoor punched me

954
01:14:09,708 --> 01:14:12,791
he called the Commissioner
to complain about Gujral.

955
01:14:17,916 --> 01:14:23,500
All your indiscretions
will become public

956
01:14:24,083 --> 01:14:27,000
right in the midst
of my election campaign!

957
01:14:36,166 --> 01:14:37,458
<span style="style.default_1">Sir must be busy.</span>

958
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,458
<span style="style.default_1">Shall I call back?</span>

959
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,041
Who's this?

960
01:14:44,125 --> 01:14:46,083
Inspector Gujral, CID.

961
01:14:46,291 --> 01:14:48,416
<span style="style.default_1">How can we help you, sir?</span>

962
01:14:48,666 --> 01:14:50,208
We found a video on this phone.

963
01:14:53,250 --> 01:14:54,750
What kind of video?

964
01:14:55,291 --> 01:14:58,333
The kind that ruins lives.

965
01:15:00,125 --> 01:15:03,458
Actually, Meghna Shergill's peon
is in my custody.

966
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:06,708
The peon was blackmailing her,

967
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:09,000
but his real target was you.

968
01:15:10,791 --> 01:15:13,916
<span style="style.default_1">This peon...</span>

969
01:15:14,541 --> 01:15:15,375
<span style="style.default_1">Whom does he work for?</span>

970
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:16,750
What does he want from me?

971
01:15:17,291 --> 01:15:19,041
The name of a witness.

972
01:15:22,583 --> 01:15:25,916
<span style="style.default_1">It's about tomorrow's trial.</span>

973
01:15:28,625 --> 01:15:31,500
<span style="style.default_1">The one involving</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the famous encounter specialist.</span>

974
01:15:31,833 --> 01:15:35,125
Hey, listen.
Why don't you get to the point?

975
01:15:35,458 --> 01:15:36,833
One moment.

976
01:15:38,208 --> 01:15:42,750
To protect the witness from these goons,
we need extra security.

977
01:15:43,125 --> 01:15:46,708
I am ready to volunteer.
It's my duty after all.

978
01:15:48,375 --> 01:15:51,375
<span style="style.default_1">I... can talk to the Police Chief.</span>

979
01:15:54,291 --> 01:15:56,166
You have a word in his ear.

980
01:15:56,458 --> 01:15:58,541
Mr. Gujrat, this, uh...

981
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,083
video...

982
01:16:02,791 --> 01:16:04,333
I want to see it.

983
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,083
Ira.

984
01:16:09,291 --> 01:16:10,708
Ira, listen to me--

985
01:16:13,583 --> 01:16:16,000
If your friend is really lucky,

986
01:16:16,333 --> 01:16:18,583
she may just lose one leg.

987
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:20,625
<span style="style.default_1">What?</span>

988
01:16:21,583 --> 01:16:23,375
How much did Chacha pay you?

989
01:16:25,666 --> 01:16:26,833
300 rupees.

990
01:16:33,791 --> 01:16:35,708
He used to make bombs.

991
01:16:38,291 --> 01:16:41,750
Mostly to entrap people
for the Encounter squad.

992
01:16:46,458 --> 01:16:50,083
Wherever your parcel is delivered

993
01:16:50,208 --> 01:16:51,958
at whatever time...

994
01:16:54,208 --> 01:16:55,666
We will soon find that out.

995
01:16:58,583 --> 01:17:01,333
Pray to God it's not RDX.

996
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:17,666
It's not your fault.

997
01:17:18,625 --> 01:17:20,000
You're the delivery boy

998
01:17:20,083 --> 01:17:22,916
who delivers on time, guaranteed.

999
01:17:23,166 --> 01:17:25,333
You're a man of your words
and you'd give your life.

1000
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:42,625
Uh, at least her belongings are here.

1001
01:17:45,541 --> 01:17:48,833
-Yes, madam, tell me.
-Sorry to trouble you on Sunday.

1002
01:17:48,916 --> 01:17:52,375
It's about the Star Witness case.

1003
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:57,208
The Pandya case.

1004
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:02,041
The government should perhaps
provide extra security to the witness.

1005
01:18:02,583 --> 01:18:07,000
<span style="style.default_1">A CID Inspector is already</span>
<span style="style.default_1">looking into it. Gujral?</span>

1006
01:18:07,416 --> 01:18:09,416
He's the one who threatened Karan today.

1007
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:13,041
Don't worry about that.
It was a misunderstanding, in fact.

1008
01:18:13,125 --> 01:18:16,041
It will be better
if you stay out of this, ma'am.

1009
01:18:16,291 --> 01:18:17,208
Why?

1010
01:18:17,416 --> 01:18:18,875
I am the Deputy Home Minister.

1011
01:18:18,958 --> 01:18:23,041
But there's no time to check out Gujral.

1012
01:18:26,125 --> 01:18:28,208
<span style="style.default_1">Will you take the blame</span>

1013
01:18:28,416 --> 01:18:31,208
<span style="style.default_1">if, just in case, something goes wrong?</span>

1014
01:18:31,291 --> 01:18:32,958
All of us are responsible, ma'am.

1015
01:18:33,666 --> 01:18:35,125
Ah! So...

1016
01:18:35,208 --> 01:18:38,125
I'll tell Gujral. He'll contact you.

1017
01:18:45,583 --> 01:18:49,625
Roy, search the system for a CID Gujral.

1018
01:18:52,458 --> 01:18:54,916
<span style="style.default_1">She may be near Grant Road</span>

1019
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,166
<span style="style.default_1">on the way to St Anne's.</span>

1020
01:18:56,250 --> 01:18:59,416
<span style="style.default_1">I'm in a boat. I can't come out.</span>

1021
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:01,583
<span style="style.default_1">I asked her to deliver something.</span>

1022
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,666
Uncle, it might be RDX.

1023
01:19:05,250 --> 01:19:06,458
RDX?

1024
01:19:06,750 --> 01:19:08,750
She's to arrive at 8:30.

1025
01:19:08,833 --> 01:19:12,291
<span style="style.default_1">And whoever Gujral is,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">he's hunting some witness--</span>

1026
01:19:22,375 --> 01:19:25,083
<span style="style.default_1">St Anne's Church,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Grant Road, 8:30 p.m.</span>

1027
01:19:25,375 --> 01:19:27,458
What has St. Anne's Church
to do with this?

1028
01:19:27,666 --> 01:19:29,041
<span style="style.default_1">That's for you to find out.</span>

1029
01:19:29,416 --> 01:19:30,625
<span style="style.default_1">Get me the boss.</span>

1030
01:19:30,958 --> 01:19:33,166
<span style="style.default_1">He's not available.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">You'll have back up.</span>

1031
01:19:33,250 --> 01:19:34,500
I don't want backup.

1032
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:38,500
<span style="style.default_1">People are on to you.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">The commissioner is involved too.</span>

1033
01:19:38,583 --> 01:19:40,708
I said I don't need back up!

1034
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:44,208
<span style="style.default_1">It's not in your hands.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Stand by for orders.</span>

1035
01:19:51,375 --> 01:19:52,875
<span style="style.default_1">Connection broken.</span>

1036
01:19:53,458 --> 01:19:55,416
Who is our back up?

1037
01:19:55,916 --> 01:19:56,958
<span style="style.default_1">Rathore.</span>

1038
01:19:58,916 --> 01:20:01,375
When he's in position, connect us.

1039
01:20:01,666 --> 01:20:04,791
Why didn't you mention St Anne's?

1040
01:20:04,875 --> 01:20:06,333
How does he know?

1041
01:20:06,583 --> 01:20:08,333
We've been roaming around since morning!
Why didn't you tell me?

1042
01:20:08,416 --> 01:20:10,166
A courier's code is silence!

1043
01:20:10,250 --> 01:20:12,958
There's a tap on both phones!

1044
01:20:14,166 --> 01:20:15,166
A tap?

1045
01:20:25,333 --> 01:20:28,250
Look, I don't know who's chasing who,

1046
01:20:28,541 --> 01:20:31,541
I just don't want that girl
to die in a bomb blast

1047
01:20:31,666 --> 01:20:32,500
but--

1048
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:57,541
<span style="style.default_1">My child,</span>

1049
01:20:58,666 --> 01:21:00,166
<span style="style.default_1">Since you are reading this</span>

1050
01:21:00,666 --> 01:21:03,416
<span style="style.default_1">it means my trusty courier</span>

1051
01:21:04,083 --> 01:21:08,208
<span style="style.default_1">has delivered your scooter</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to Father Daniel.</span>

1052
01:21:10,916 --> 01:21:14,083
<span style="style.default_1">You can have faith in this man</span>

1053
01:21:14,958 --> 01:21:17,000
<span style="style.default_1">to not to open the parcel</span>

1054
01:21:17,541 --> 01:21:20,791
<span style="style.default_1">nor talk of it to anyone.</span>

1055
01:21:27,208 --> 01:21:30,250
<span style="style.default_1">We've seen so much in the last five years.</span>

1056
01:21:31,583 --> 01:21:33,541
<span style="style.default_1">You taught me much.</span>

1057
01:21:34,166 --> 01:21:37,000
<span style="style.default_1">Now you must go on...</span>

1058
01:21:38,125 --> 01:21:39,208
<span style="style.default_1">without me.</span>

1059
01:21:48,791 --> 01:21:51,833
<span style="style.default_1">Tomorrow, when you're</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the star witness,</span>

1060
01:21:52,583 --> 01:21:55,458
<span style="style.default_1">I may not be in court with you.</span>

1061
01:22:03,958 --> 01:22:07,500
<span style="style.default_1">My written testimony</span>
<span style="style.default_1">must reach Commissioner Wadia</span>

1062
01:22:07,916 --> 01:22:10,416
<span style="style.default_1">who has wanted justice</span>
<span style="style.default_1">for Stanley D'Mello for years now.</span>

1063
01:22:40,333 --> 01:22:43,083
<span style="style.default_1">I discovered later...</span>

1064
01:22:44,083 --> 01:22:47,541
<span style="style.default_1">why Don Arun Naik was used...</span>

1065
01:22:49,583 --> 01:22:51,291
<span style="style.default_1">for such a gruesome job.</span>

1066
01:22:56,541 --> 01:23:00,208
<span style="style.default_1">Someone wished for Stanley D'Mello</span>

1067
01:23:00,291 --> 01:23:05,458
<span style="style.default_1">to take revenge</span>
<span style="style.default_1">on the Don's gang and family...</span>

1068
01:23:09,125 --> 01:23:11,416
<span style="style.default_1">for the murder of his wife.</span>

1069
01:23:14,416 --> 01:23:18,541
<span style="style.default_1">No one could link your</span>
<span style="style.default_1">mother's death to Pandya...</span>

1070
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:21,833
<span style="style.default_1">except you.</span>

1071
01:23:35,625 --> 01:23:38,750
<span style="style.default_1">You, and Pandya's driver, Ramakanth...</span>

1072
01:23:40,791 --> 01:23:43,333
<span style="style.default_1">both drowned...</span>

1073
01:23:47,166 --> 01:23:48,458
<span style="style.default_1">in a sea of silence.</span>

1074
01:23:51,541 --> 01:23:54,333
<span style="style.default_1">From the shell of a shattered family...</span>

1075
01:23:55,333 --> 01:23:58,208
<span style="style.default_1">Pandya created a hollow killing machine.</span>

1076
01:23:59,666 --> 01:24:01,916
<span style="style.default_1">That left you like an orphan.</span>

1077
01:24:06,208 --> 01:24:09,291
<span style="style.default_1">Your only sanctuary...</span>

1078
01:24:11,458 --> 01:24:16,166
<span style="style.default_1">was the place your family</span>
<span style="style.default_1">visited on Sundays.</span>

1079
01:24:18,541 --> 01:24:20,041
<span style="style.default_1">St. Anne's Church.</span>

1080
01:24:25,250 --> 01:24:27,000
<span style="style.default_1">-Sir, Rathore.</span>
-Hmm.

1081
01:24:28,916 --> 01:24:31,416
Rathore, listen up.

1082
01:24:31,875 --> 01:24:34,291
This concerns national security.

1083
01:24:34,666 --> 01:24:37,958
<span style="style.default_1">Your target is a CID officer</span>

1084
01:24:38,750 --> 01:24:42,541
and there is one more target
that you need to identify.

1085
01:24:54,791 --> 01:24:56,583
-Look, Dheere.
-Huh?

1086
01:24:58,583 --> 01:25:01,375
Our country's two heroes,
looking in the same direction

1087
01:25:02,791 --> 01:25:04,916
but with different weapons.

1088
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:08,750
A bit like us.

1089
01:25:11,666 --> 01:25:13,416
You pack a pistol.

1090
01:25:15,125 --> 01:25:16,458
I don't.

1091
01:25:19,333 --> 01:25:21,458
Giving you a pistol
would be a mistake.

1092
01:25:25,541 --> 01:25:26,958
They have to be fired sometimes.

1093
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:32,375
-Has anyone spoken to them?
-No, they've been in your office.

1094
01:25:32,458 --> 01:25:35,791
Has Gurjal made contact?

1095
01:25:35,875 --> 01:25:38,708
No. Sorry, sir,
I couldn't find out much about him.

1096
01:25:38,791 --> 01:25:40,125
-Dig deeper!
-Sir.

1097
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,375
I want transcripts from
that stolen phone, now!

1098
01:25:44,458 --> 01:25:46,541
Sir, they're on your desk.

1099
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,958
Sir, the number has been monitored
since morning.

1100
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:54,791
On whose authority?

1101
01:25:55,166 --> 01:25:56,250
Sir, yours.

1102
01:25:57,500 --> 01:25:58,708
Sit over there.

1103
01:26:01,708 --> 01:26:05,375
Monitor all phones
in contact with that number.

1104
01:26:05,458 --> 01:26:07,458
And show me all authorizations!

1105
01:26:12,041 --> 01:26:13,083
So...

1106
01:26:15,875 --> 01:26:18,791
How did you two hear about this witness?

1107
01:26:23,166 --> 01:26:24,500
I've reached the location.

1108
01:26:31,250 --> 01:26:33,458
The pink scooter is here.
A woman is riding it.

1109
01:26:34,833 --> 01:26:38,375
See who she meets at 8:30.

1110
01:26:38,458 --> 01:26:42,250
Looks like she's delivering a parcel.

1111
01:26:43,333 --> 01:26:45,500
-Any sign of Gujral?
-Not yet.

1112
01:26:46,166 --> 01:26:49,625
So whoever the girl gives the parcel to
is our target.

1113
01:26:49,791 --> 01:26:53,666
<span style="style.default_1">Rejoice, rejoice</span>

1114
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:57,000
<span style="style.default_1">Emmanuel</span>

1115
01:27:01,250 --> 01:27:05,625
<span style="style.default_1">Father Daniel allowed me</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to put his signature</span>

1116
01:27:06,041 --> 01:27:09,916
<span style="style.default_1">on Alice's death certificate,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and all public records.</span>

1117
01:27:11,708 --> 01:27:12,875
Alice!

1118
01:27:17,708 --> 01:27:19,583
<span style="style.default_1">Inside is all you need</span>

1119
01:27:20,708 --> 01:27:23,250
<span style="style.default_1">to become Prerna Mathur.</span>

1120
01:27:24,166 --> 01:27:25,625
Who's Prerna Mathur?

1121
01:28:19,125 --> 01:28:21,583
Please wait here. Wait here.

1122
01:28:22,041 --> 01:28:23,083
Uh...

1123
01:28:25,708 --> 01:28:28,541
<span style="style.default_1">If only we were born</span>
<span style="style.default_1">with the knowledge...</span>

1124
01:28:29,791 --> 01:28:32,208
<span style="style.default_1">that we gained by life's end.</span>

1125
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:33,583
Gujral is here.

1126
01:28:37,125 --> 01:28:38,500
We need that parcel.

1127
01:28:39,708 --> 01:28:42,625
<span style="style.default_1">That we are all part</span>
<span style="style.default_1">of one living being.</span>

1128
01:28:46,333 --> 01:28:48,458
<span style="style.default_1">The bonding inside the concrete.</span>

1129
01:28:50,958 --> 01:28:54,291
Here's your parcel.
And the keys to your scooter.

1130
01:28:54,875 --> 01:28:57,291
I'm underage for a scooter.

1131
01:28:58,041 --> 01:29:00,250
What was Chacha thinking?

1132
01:29:00,583 --> 01:29:02,750
<span style="style.default_1">I won't be able to big goodbye.</span>

1133
01:29:04,583 --> 01:29:07,791
<span style="style.default_1">I can only leave you a poem of Kabir's...</span>

1134
01:29:09,125 --> 01:29:11,041
<span style="style.default_1">in which I see myself.</span>

1135
01:29:14,416 --> 01:29:16,625
<span style="style.default_1">"I went in search of a crooked fellow</span>

1136
01:29:18,083 --> 01:29:19,791
<span style="style.default_1">Looked far away and near</span>

1137
01:29:22,375 --> 01:29:24,375
<span style="style.default_1">When I got home and looked inward</span>

1138
01:29:27,708 --> 01:29:29,458
<span style="style.default_1">I found him already here</span>

1139
01:29:35,708 --> 01:29:38,708
<span style="style.default_1">I will offer these words to my maker</span>

1140
01:29:42,166 --> 01:29:44,625
<span style="style.default_1">Whenever we may meet"</span>

1141
01:29:58,416 --> 01:29:59,958
CID Gujral.

1142
01:30:00,375 --> 01:30:01,708
We've been informed of a bomb.

1143
01:30:01,791 --> 01:30:03,291
-Please move out.
-Bomb?

1144
01:30:03,375 --> 01:30:04,875
Outside, hurry.

1145
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:09,041
There is a bomb inside. Please leave.

1146
01:30:09,708 --> 01:30:10,875
Sir, outside.

1147
01:30:11,333 --> 01:30:12,458
For your safety...

1148
01:30:13,833 --> 01:30:15,541
-Leave this here.
-Please move out.

1149
01:30:16,625 --> 01:30:19,791
Close the doors, Father.
No one enters unless I say.

1150
01:30:19,875 --> 01:30:22,041
Leave the church. Leave!

1151
01:30:31,208 --> 01:30:32,166
What are you doing?

1152
01:30:39,250 --> 01:30:41,916
Children! Who wants a present?

1153
01:30:42,958 --> 01:30:44,041
What's going on?

1154
01:30:51,583 --> 01:30:54,375
<span style="style.default_1">That girl on the scooter</span>
<span style="style.default_1">is handing parcels to everyone.</span>

1155
01:31:02,916 --> 01:31:04,625
-Someone is with her.
<span style="style.default_1">-Who?</span>

1156
01:31:04,708 --> 01:31:09,041
Well, Santa's friend...
who looks like a camel..

1157
01:31:10,166 --> 01:31:11,750
Yeah... <span style="style.default_1">Rundeer</span>!

1158
01:31:18,166 --> 01:31:19,583
More people have arrived.

1159
01:31:24,333 --> 01:31:26,875
Gujral, or whatever he's called,
is here already.

1160
01:31:28,250 --> 01:31:30,041
They're hugging each other.

1161
01:31:31,291 --> 01:31:32,333
Oh.

1162
01:31:34,208 --> 01:31:37,416
Don't worry. Everyone's coming.
My mummy, daddy,

1163
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:39,250
-my brother-in-law, the commissioner--
-Papa?

1164
01:31:47,916 --> 01:31:49,833
He thinks I'm Mohit.

1165
01:31:50,375 --> 01:31:53,125
If it makes life easier for you
we can stay engaged.

1166
01:31:53,208 --> 01:31:54,791
Break it off later if you like--

1167
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:14,583
Alice.

1168
01:32:23,416 --> 01:32:24,500
Gujral?

1169
01:32:24,708 --> 01:32:27,666
Santa and <span style="style.default_1">Rundeer </span>are holding hands.

1170
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:29,166
Everyone's looking somewhere else.

1171
01:32:29,583 --> 01:32:30,541
<span style="style.default_1">I can't quite see.</span>

1172
01:32:38,791 --> 01:32:40,000
-Hatman!
-Pintu!

1173
01:32:40,083 --> 01:32:43,166
-Meghna!
-What's going on?

1174
01:32:45,083 --> 01:32:46,458
Take good care of her.

1175
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,500
Papa. My parents.

1176
01:32:50,750 --> 01:32:52,208
What about the RDX?

1177
01:32:54,458 --> 01:32:57,708
Hey, do you have a phone?
I need to make a call, please.

1178
01:32:58,333 --> 01:33:00,291
It'll cost you.

1179
01:33:00,750 --> 01:33:03,083
Here, take all of it.

1180
01:33:05,416 --> 01:33:09,041
-There's... zero credit left.
-What?

1181
01:33:14,291 --> 01:33:15,583
Where's the bomb?

1182
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,041
-Now what?
-Commissioner Wadia is here.

1183
01:33:18,166 --> 01:33:19,750
Everyone freeze! Nobody moves!

1184
01:33:20,833 --> 01:33:22,125
God bless you.

1185
01:33:22,958 --> 01:33:24,791
-Greetings.
-Sir, family, sir.

1186
01:33:24,875 --> 01:33:26,375
Is your entire family involved?

1187
01:33:26,458 --> 01:33:28,083
Is this for me?

1188
01:33:30,833 --> 01:33:33,583
-Give it to me.
-One minute.

1189
01:33:33,666 --> 01:33:36,333
Okay, the boy has the parcel.

1190
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:41,333
They're playing pass-the-parcel.

1191
01:33:41,416 --> 01:33:43,083
Where's Gujral?

1192
01:33:56,291 --> 01:33:58,333
The parcel is with the commissioner now.

1193
01:34:09,833 --> 01:34:11,000
Kill Wadia.

1194
01:34:13,791 --> 01:34:15,166
Shoot everybody.

1195
01:34:20,333 --> 01:34:23,125
Get away from here! Go! Move!

1196
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:38,458
<span style="style.default_1">There's no answer from Rathore, sir.</span>

1197
01:34:38,833 --> 01:34:39,708
<span style="style.default_1">One second.</span>

1198
01:34:39,791 --> 01:34:41,541
<span style="style.default_1">There is an incoming call</span>
<span style="style.default_1">on Sharma's phone.</span>

1199
01:34:42,375 --> 01:34:43,208
Go inside.

1200
01:34:43,291 --> 01:34:44,666
<span style="style.default_1">Listen to me carefully.</span>

1201
01:34:44,750 --> 01:34:46,791
The St. Anne's parcel is a decoy.

1202
01:34:46,875 --> 01:34:48,583
I have the real parcel.

1203
01:34:48,666 --> 01:34:49,708
Huh?

1204
01:34:50,375 --> 01:34:51,500
Where are you?

1205
01:34:51,583 --> 01:34:52,500
Never mind.

1206
01:34:52,583 --> 01:34:54,250
<span style="style.default_1">Send someone to collect the parcel.</span>

1207
01:34:54,333 --> 01:34:56,125
<span style="style.default_1">They'll find it in a canoe</span>

1208
01:34:56,208 --> 01:35:00,000
behind Jesus's shrine
which is beyond the Worli Fort.

1209
01:35:03,250 --> 01:35:04,958
What's a Jesus shrine?

1210
01:35:05,041 --> 01:35:06,125
Church.

1211
01:35:08,166 --> 01:35:09,250
Which church are they talking about?

1212
01:35:09,333 --> 01:35:10,375
It's in Koliwada.

1213
01:35:11,708 --> 01:35:13,750
And what do we do there?

1214
01:35:13,833 --> 01:35:14,916
Fetch the parcel.

1215
01:35:18,208 --> 01:35:19,375
Listen.

1216
01:35:19,750 --> 01:35:22,583
This is your phone.
Take it away and destroy it.

1217
01:35:23,625 --> 01:35:25,208
Merry Christmas. Go!

1218
01:35:58,166 --> 01:36:01,791
<span style="style.default_1">Ma'am, I didn't approve</span>
<span style="style.default_1">any additional security</span>

1219
01:36:02,041 --> 01:36:03,958
which you wanted Gujral to provide,

1220
01:36:04,041 --> 01:36:06,208
because there's no Gujral in our system.

1221
01:36:07,666 --> 01:36:11,875
I'm sorry, ma'am, but I need you and Karan
to reach St. Anne's Church at Grant Road.

1222
01:36:12,750 --> 01:36:13,916
Are you summoning me?

1223
01:36:14,416 --> 01:36:18,041
You decide whether you want to be summoned
by the court or me.

1224
01:36:18,791 --> 01:36:20,208
<span style="style.default_1">We're all responsible, aren't we?</span>

1225
01:36:24,958 --> 01:36:27,166
Uncle Terrorist went that way.

1226
01:36:28,625 --> 01:36:30,166
That was Mr. D'Mello.

1227
01:36:33,250 --> 01:36:34,208
Who is he?

1228
01:36:35,166 --> 01:36:36,583
Police! Hands up!

1229
01:36:36,666 --> 01:36:37,750
Where did you...

1230
01:36:38,833 --> 01:36:40,291
What are you doing?

1231
01:36:40,791 --> 01:36:41,708
It's me!

1232
01:36:44,208 --> 01:36:45,500
The parcel.

1233
01:36:46,291 --> 01:36:48,833
That's in the other church.

1234
01:36:49,083 --> 01:36:50,541
-What?
-Yeah.

1235
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,041
Then what's this?

1236
01:37:17,041 --> 01:37:19,208
My plan was to trap Gujral.

1237
01:37:21,041 --> 01:37:22,750
But this thug showed up.

1238
01:37:22,958 --> 01:37:25,791
Will I have to pay for all his crimes?

1239
01:37:26,083 --> 01:37:27,958
He thinks we're all idiots.

1240
01:37:28,458 --> 01:37:30,791
-Put me in another jail.
-Which jail?

1241
01:37:30,875 --> 01:37:33,291
Who are you talking about? Get up!

1242
01:37:34,416 --> 01:37:35,666
You don't get it.

1243
01:37:38,458 --> 01:37:40,166
He will drive me crazy!

1244
01:37:42,541 --> 01:37:44,666
<span style="style.default_1">A wise man once said...</span>

1245
01:37:53,416 --> 01:37:56,208
<span style="style.default_1">"Knowingly or unknowingly</span>
<span style="style.default_1">we decide to meet...</span>

1246
01:38:05,750 --> 01:38:07,166
<span style="style.default_1">because our decisions bind us."</span>

1247
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,375
<span style="style.default_1">"In this great city...</span>

1248
01:38:17,791 --> 01:38:20,875
<span style="style.default_1">you can go from strangers</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to becoming friends in one night.</span>

1249
01:38:24,583 --> 01:38:26,125
<span style="style.default_1">Friends who are like family."</span>

1250
01:38:38,166 --> 01:38:40,375
<span style="style.default_1">"How much ever we run from people...</span>

1251
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,166
<span style="style.default_1">thinking people are the problem..."</span>

1252
01:38:51,041 --> 01:38:52,583
<span style="style.default_1">I mean, it's true.</span>

1253
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:55,583
<span style="style.default_1">We do cause each other's problems...</span>

1254
01:39:02,750 --> 01:39:05,041
<span style="style.default_1">but we are also a part of their solution.</span>

1255
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,416
I'm sorely tempted to lock you all up

1256
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:15,958
till this trial is complete.

1257
01:39:27,916 --> 01:39:30,958
<span style="style.default_1">We are, as the wise man put it...</span>

1258
01:39:34,250 --> 01:39:36,333
<span style="style.default_1">"All part of one living being."</span>

1259
01:39:37,583 --> 01:39:39,958
<span style="style.default_1">"And our bonding is</span>
<span style="style.default_1">as strong as concrete."</span>

1260
01:39:40,041 --> 01:39:41,083
Repeat after me.

1261
01:39:41,166 --> 01:39:42,666
-I...
-"I."

1262
01:39:43,333 --> 01:39:44,416
...solemnly swear...

1263
01:39:44,500 --> 01:39:45,875
"Solemnly swear..."

1264
01:39:45,958 --> 01:39:48,833
-...that the star witness...
-"...that the star witness..."

1265
01:39:48,916 --> 01:39:51,625
-...prior identity...
-"...prior identity..."

1266
01:39:51,708 --> 01:39:55,833
-...shall never be revealed by me.
-"...shall never be revealed by me."

1267
01:39:55,916 --> 01:39:58,458
-As long as I live.
-"As long as I live."

1268
01:39:58,541 --> 01:40:00,791
-Victory to India!
-"Victory to India!"

1269
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,583
<span style="style.default_1">-Victory to India!</span>
<span style="style.default_1">-"Victory to India!"</span>

1270
01:40:06,041 --> 01:40:10,833
<span style="style.default_1">The public discovered how Pandya</span>
<span style="style.default_1">finished off an entire gang</span>

<span style="style.default_1">by instigating D'Mello.</span>

1272
01:40:17,208 --> 01:40:19,708
<span style="style.default_1">All for the hundred million</span>
<span style="style.default_1">that some other gang</span>

1273
01:40:19,791 --> 01:40:21,791
<span style="style.default_1">invested in Satya Rahi Party!</span>

1274

1276
01:40:35,875 --> 01:40:37,541

<span style="style.default_1">suddenly found courage...</span>

1279
01:40:50,333 --> 01:40:52,000

1280
01:40:54,833 --> 01:40:57,291
<span style="style.default_1">The point here is</span>
<span style="style.default_1">if we want to change the system,</span>

1281
01:40:57,375 --> 01:41:00,458
<span style="style.default_1">we need to change how politicians think.</span>

1282
01:41:01,625 --> 01:41:04,166
<span style="style.default_1">We don't make laws.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Laws are made by the State.</span>

1283
01:41:04,250 --> 01:41:06,208
<span style="style.default_1">We just enforce them. That's all.</span>

1284
01:41:06,291 --> 01:41:07,750
India's first

1285
01:41:08,791 --> 01:41:10,958
Witness Protection Program

1286
01:41:11,333 --> 01:41:14,166
otherwise known as the
<span style="style.default_1">Gawah Suraksha Karyakram.</span>

1287
01:41:27,041 --> 01:41:29,500
<span style="style.default_1">Apparently Pandya has a mental illness</span>

1288
01:41:30,083 --> 01:41:31,375
<span style="style.default_1">caused by idiots,</span>

1289
01:41:33,041 --> 01:41:34,958
<span style="style.default_1">meaning all of us.</span>

1290
01:41:39,625 --> 01:41:43,333
<span style="style.default_1">I feel I fit right in</span>
<span style="style.default_1">with all the other idiots</span>

1291
01:41:43,958 --> 01:41:45,458
<span style="style.default_1">who are out there</span>

1292
01:41:46,708 --> 01:41:49,083
<span style="style.default_1">trying to be the change</span>
<span style="style.default_1">we want to see in our world.</span>

1293
01:41:51,708 --> 01:41:54,166
I want to ask the Commissioner,

1294
01:41:54,250 --> 01:41:56,333
who hasn't come on my TV show for a while.

1295
01:41:56,416 --> 01:41:59,291
A few years back,
Stanley D'Mello disappeared.

1296
01:42:00,125 --> 01:42:02,000
Are you closer to solving that mystery?

1297
01:42:02,708 --> 01:42:06,041
Some incidents
are meant to remain mysteries.

1298
01:42:07,875 --> 01:42:10,666
Anyway, among us today,

1299
01:42:10,750 --> 01:42:14,000
is someone I'm really thankful to.

1300
01:42:14,083 --> 01:42:17,083
I want him to be recognized by the world.

1301
01:42:17,166 --> 01:42:18,833
Which is why, next month

1302
01:42:18,916 --> 01:42:21,916
Sub-inspector Dhanendra Patil,
will go to the Rashtrapati Bhavan

1303
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,583
to receive the President's Police Medal

1304
01:42:25,125 --> 01:42:26,416
for gallantry.

1305
01:42:41,875 --> 01:42:43,208
Mr. Dhanendra Patil.

1306
01:42:45,750 --> 01:42:47,291
How are you feeling, Mr. Patil?

1307
01:43:29,208 --> 01:43:32,041
Name one superhero
who doesn't have a sad private life?

1308
01:44:08,541 --> 01:44:14,666
<span style="style.default_1">I made up my mind</span>
<span style="style.default_1">And set out to accomplish something</span>

1309
01:44:15,666 --> 01:44:18,416
<span style="style.default_1">My Lord</span>

1310
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:27,958
<span style="style.default_1">I made up my mind</span>
<span style="style.default_1">And set out to accomplish something</span>

1311
01:44:28,041 --> 01:44:30,791
<span style="style.default_1">I set out to accomplish something</span>

1312
01:44:30,875 --> 01:44:36,500
<span style="style.default_1">Whatever I need</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I will take it from You right now</span>

1313
01:44:36,833 --> 01:44:39,666
<span style="style.default_1">I will bow down</span>

1314
01:44:39,750 --> 01:44:42,458
<span style="style.default_1">I will bow down to You</span>

1315
01:44:42,541 --> 01:44:45,833
<span style="style.default_1">I will bow down</span>

1316
01:44:45,916 --> 01:44:47,333
<span style="style.default_1">I will bow down to You</span>

1317
01:44:47,416 --> 01:44:50,166
<span style="style.default_1">My Lord</span>

1318
01:45:00,333 --> 01:45:02,125
<span style="style.default_1">Get lost from here</span>

1319
01:45:14,083 --> 01:45:16,916
<span style="style.default_1">The night is long and the cars are big</span>

1320
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,625
<span style="style.default_1">There are hundreds of people</span>
<span style="style.default_1">We think about</span>

1321
01:45:19,708 --> 01:45:21,750
<span style="style.default_1">You have to be careful</span>

1322
01:45:25,416 --> 01:45:28,125
<span style="style.default_1">Increase the speed</span>

1323
01:45:28,208 --> 01:45:30,916
<span style="style.default_1">And increase the heat</span>
<span style="style.default_1">By wearing a backless blouse</span>

1324
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:32,916
<span style="style.default_1">You have to be careful</span>

1325
01:45:36,583 --> 01:45:39,333
<span style="style.default_1">You love roaming around</span>

1326
01:45:39,416 --> 01:45:42,083
<span style="style.default_1">You aren't bothered about eating</span>

1327
01:45:42,166 --> 01:45:43,875
<span style="style.default_1">You have to be careful</span>

1328
01:45:47,750 --> 01:45:50,416
<span style="style.default_1">Hey, chant God's name</span>
<span style="style.default_1">And get all the stuff here</span>

1329
01:45:50,500 --> 01:45:53,208
<span style="style.default_1">Then throw it all in the river</span>

1330
01:45:53,333 --> 01:45:56,041
<span style="style.default_1">I know what brought you here</span>

1331
01:45:56,125 --> 01:45:58,833
<span style="style.default_1">There will be a lot of confusion</span>
<span style="style.default_1">You better pull up your socks</span>

1332
01:45:59,250 --> 01:46:00,583
<span style="style.default_1">Shall we earn or shall we vote?</span>

1333
01:46:00,666 --> 01:46:01,916
<span style="style.default_1">What do we do?</span>

1334
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,583
<span style="style.default_1">Everyone around us is waiting</span>
<span style="style.default_1">But the system is down</span>

1335
01:46:04,666 --> 01:46:05,833
<span style="style.default_1">Hey, weirdo</span>

1336
01:46:05,916 --> 01:46:08,541
<span style="style.default_1">Give me the OTP</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Hey, weirdo</span>

1337
01:46:08,666 --> 01:46:09,958
<span style="style.default_1">Hey, weirdo</span>

1338
01:46:10,375 --> 01:46:12,916
<span style="style.default_1">You have all the news in the world</span>
<span style="style.default_1">And you're not scared of God</span>

1339
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,833
<span style="style.default_1">You keep posting weird stuff</span>
<span style="style.default_1">On social media</span>

1340
01:46:15,916 --> 01:46:17,833
<span style="style.default_1">Hey, weirdo</span>

1341
01:46:54,708 --> 01:46:57,416
<span style="style.default_1">You've made so many preparations</span>

1342
01:46:57,541 --> 01:47:00,208
<span style="style.default_1">But we'll remain friends</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Only for a few days</span>

1343
01:47:00,291 --> 01:47:05,833
<span style="style.default_1">Who will take your responsibility?</span>

1344
01:47:05,916 --> 01:47:08,583
<span style="style.default_1">You are an honest person</span>

1345
01:47:08,666 --> 01:47:11,375
<span style="style.default_1">And your lovers are businessmen</span>

1346
01:47:11,458 --> 01:47:17,000
<span style="style.default_1">We never know when you might</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Do something magical</span>

1347
01:47:17,083 --> 01:47:21,458
<span style="style.default_1">You don't put up with anyone's bullshit</span>

1348
01:47:22,625 --> 01:47:25,250
<span style="style.default_1">Don't pass by the adjacent lane</span>

1349
01:47:25,333 --> 01:47:28,083
<span style="style.default_1">There are boys waiting to tease you</span>

1350
01:47:28,166 --> 01:47:29,916
<span style="style.default_1">You have to be careful</span>

1351
01:47:33,791 --> 01:47:36,541
<span style="style.default_1">You love roaming around</span>

1352
01:47:36,625 --> 01:47:39,291
<span style="style.default_1">You aren't bothered about eating</span>

1353
01:47:39,375 --> 01:47:41,083
<span style="style.default_1">You have to be careful</span>

1354
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,708
<span style="style.default_1">Hey, sinner</span>

1355
01:48:04,458 --> 01:48:06,166
<span style="style.default_1">Get lost from here</span>

1356
01:48:06,250 --> 01:48:08,250
<span style="style.default_1">Translated by:</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Salonee Kadam</span>
