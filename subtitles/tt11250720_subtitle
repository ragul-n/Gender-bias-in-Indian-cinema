Mr. Venu, I'll get going.

22
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:46,958
Brother Dasappan!

23
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,583
Could you please deliver this parcel?
This is the address.

24
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:10,083
-Have you got a parcel?
-Yes.

25
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:12,291
-Which floor?
-It's 12 B.

26
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:13,708
Oh! Tough luck!

27
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:16,875
There's no power…
and the generator is getting repaired.

28
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,916
-I'll deliver it later if that's okay.
-Let me check with them.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,875
Okay, do that.

30
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:29,416
Sir, I've got your parcel
from the restaurant.

31
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,458
<i>Okay, where are you?</i>

32
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,333
-I am downstairs.
<i>-Why?</i>

33
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:35,083
There's no power…
and the elevator isn't working.

34
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:39,500
Is it okay if the security
guard delivers it later?

35
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:42,291
<i>There is a staircase, right?</i>
<i>Deliver it right now!</i>

36
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,541
How's it going, Mithun?
When will it get fixed?

37
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,916
-There's been a short circuit.
-Oh.

38
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,208
Joe! You can't force me to sign it!

39
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:39,791
I need to read the whole thing first!

40
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:41,916
Only then I'll decide what to do!

41
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,291
You're talking as if I am
starting an illegal business!

42
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:46,250
To hell with you!

43
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,125
-What is it, man?
-Your parcel.

44
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,166
You're supposed to deliver
it to my doorstep, got it?

45
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,541
Sorry, there was no power.

46
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,333
-So, should I eat at your convenience?
-Send him away, Joe!

47
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,625
Let's solve this issue first!
Everything else can wait!

48
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,416
-Sir…
-Yes.

49
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,416
I'll park it for you.

50
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,250
-Here's your key.
-Thank you.

51
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,458
You're welcome, sir.

52
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,000
What is it?

53
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,083
Sister, Dad's not well!
Come quickly to the medical college!

54
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,000
What happened to him?

55
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:58,750
I don't know!
Mom and I are on our way there!

56
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,750
Brother, could you please take that route?

57
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:08,833
What for?

58
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,291
I'll tell you, wait!
Brother, please speed up.

59
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,958
-Stop right here.
-What for?

60
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:17,541
-I'll be right back.
-Come back quickly!

61
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:18,458
Yes.

62
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:23,375
However late it gets,
I am just a phone call away, okay?

63
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:26,416
Brother, let's go!

64
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,166
-Sister, where's the casualty ward?
-It's over there.

65
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:06,333
Tell me! What happened?

66
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,208
He has chest pain.

67
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:09,958
Come!

68
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,333
You go ahead. I can't see him like this.

69
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,458
-Sanal, come with me!
-Where?

70
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:33,458
Just come!

71
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,458
-What is it, sister?
-Come, I'll tell you.

72
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:45,291
What is it?

73
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,291
Did someone deliver food
for you some time back?

74
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:48,250
Yes.

75
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:49,250
That was our dad!

76
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,125
So? What about it?

77
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:55,458
Our dad's in the hospital because of you!
You made him climb 12 flights of stairs!

78
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,125
Oh, really? Go, file a case against me!

79
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:01,375
You didn't even give him as much
value as the food you threw away!

80
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:02,500
What's the problem here?

81
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,500
-Sister, let's just go.
-Let go of me!

82
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:06,875
Are you even a human being?

83
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:09,333
You still don't think you
did anything wrong, do you?

84
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:11,458
-Are you here to teach me right and wrong?
-You--

85
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,541
Hey, stop making a fuss and leave!

86
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,791
-I am not here to talk to you!
-Sister--

87
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,958
Do you know whom you are talking
to, girl?

88
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,541
What does it matter to me who you are?

89
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:22,583
And keep your arrogance
to yourself, alright?

90
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:24,958
-Sister, let's go please!
-Let go of me!

91
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:30,375
The doctors are saying it'll take 24 hours
to know more about his condition.

92
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:35,833
Pray that we would not have to come back.

93
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,000
Stop right there!

94
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,916
Sir, our dad is in the casualty ward.

95
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
The Chief Minister is inside.
You can't go in now.

96
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:26,333
Move aside!

97
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:32,250
Yes, Mom. We are outside.

98
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,250
Go straight!

99
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,708
Hey, move out of the way!

100
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,000
-Hey, what do you want?
-Sir, my wallet--

101
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,791
You and your wallet!
Didn't you hear what they just said?

102
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:49,750
Sir--

103
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,416
Get lost!

104
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,750
We are just ordinary people, Sanal.

105
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:27,541
Only if you have money, status,
and influence, you can live in peace here.

106
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:30,166
You know what happened yesterday!
When the CM arrived,

107
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,541
even the most senior doctors
were in attendance on him.

108
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,000
It's like other patients'
lives mean nothing to them.

109
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:39,916
Anyone can do anything to us…
and no one will bat an eyelid.

110
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,916
Don't you remember what you
wrote in the college magazine?

111
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:47,916
"Either put up with
everything or protest!"

112
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:52,583
Do you have the guts to say
a word against the Chief Minister?

113
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:59,125
You should put up a post on Facebook…

114
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:00,833
against the Chief Minister.

115
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:03,541
What are you so scared of?

116
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,666
Shouldn't he know what
is happening over here?

117
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:08,750
You can't just let it go, Sanal.

118
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:22,958
Don't post anything from your ID.
Let's make a fake ID.

119
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,875
Create such a password that
no one can ever figure out.

120
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:28,666
What if we get in trouble?

121
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,125
We won't, because we're not
doing it from our cell phones.

122
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:35,500
This place is safe.
Both of these CCTVs don't work.

123
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:39,250
Get started.

124
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:51,625
Password?

125
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,375
Even you won't be able to
remember this password!

126
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:03,500
I'll remember it. Now type a strong
message for our chief minister.

127
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,375
WARRIOR

128
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:13,958
Remya!

129
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,125
Keep writing. I will deal with her.

130
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,458
They put up a poster in
the spot we'd booked.

131
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,833
-I'd told them not to.
-The commerce department, right?

132
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:32,375
How's it going? Are you done? Let me see.

133
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:37,666
Wow. You've done a great job.

134
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,291
Don't give me that look.
This is the last dose.

135
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:52,291
Okay.

136
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,041
I won't need a rice gruel after this.
I'm almost full now.

137
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,500
Sister…
can I go home at least tomorrow?

138
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,333
Most likely you'll be
discharged tomorrow.

139
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,375
-Okay.
-You'll know after the morning rounds.

140
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:02,291
Okay.

141
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,333
-How are you feeling, Dad?
-Good.

142
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:08,916
Yeah, he keeps making a fuss
about taking his medicines.

143
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,458
-Have this.
-Oh, no!

144
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,541
I want your autograph.

145
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:17,875
Your post has gone viral!

146
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:21,666
It has got 2,5 lakh views
and 3,200 shares until now!

147
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:22,791
Really?

148
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,500
This "warrior" is getting many
friend requests from pretty girls.

149
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,000
I have accepted them for you.

150
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,041
You shouldn't have.

151
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,083
You are a big celebrity now.

152
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,458
Do you think I will get in trouble?

153
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:34,625
What trouble?

154
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:38,333
Everyone's supporting you big time!
This is going to create a storm, for sure!

155
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,375
You are going to make waves, my friend!

156
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:41,416
Honey!

157
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:44,208
-Please go and eat something.
-Yeah.

158
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,833
-She just doesn't listen to me.
-I'll call you later, okay?

159
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,083
KERALA STATE

160
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,791
Sir, because we called
the meeting in such a hurry…

161
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,416
everyone is a bit confused.

162
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:18,083
-Is your treatment over?
-Yes, sir. It's been two days.

163
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,916
You should've waited another
week before resuming work.

164
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:22,875
-Don't strain yourself.
-Yes, sir!

165
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:24,375
Take care!

166
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:29,666
This is a Facebook post!

167
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,166
You must have seen it.

168
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,500
He is indeed a "real warrior."

169
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,208
This is not like the baton
charge that took place

170
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,000
in front of the collectorate yesterday.

171
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,708
This is not like the tribal
strikes or anything else either!

172
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,791
This is what we should
focus on right now.

173
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:46,000
But sir, that is just an anonymous post.

174
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:49,166
There isn't even a name.
What credibility does it have?

175
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,541
The person who put up this
post is a human being.

176
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,875
Did you read what it says, Selin?

177
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,208
"If the Chief Minister
goes in for a treatment,

178
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:59,458
does the common man have to wait outside
and get beaten up by the police?"

179
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,416
All this has been clearly
written over here.

180
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,000
What more credibility are
you looking for, Selin?

181
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,791
Just because the ID is fake,

182
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,333
we need not assume that
the facts stated are also fake.

183
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,833
If you have a barber's
son as the Chief Minister,

184
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,458
you'll have to expect this and more.

185
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:16,666
There are a few people here who
tremble at just the mention of his name.

186
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,375
Such people need not sit here.

187
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:22,791
Only someone hiding behind a fake ID…

188
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:26,875
can criticize the Chief Minister. That is
how things are in this state currently.

189
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:28,875
Should we just stand by and watch?

190
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:32,375
It's not our job to nod and accept
whatever the Chief Minister says or does.

191
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,250
That's not what
the voters expect us to do.

192
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:37,541
This is not a small issue.
It points to the plight of the common man.

193
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,916
This is their silent plea!

194
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,083
It is them we should stand for!

195
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,625
We should organize protest
marches everywhere…

196
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:45,791
in strength.

197
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:48,083
And a strike as well.

198
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:50,166
Should we really call
for a strike, Jayanandan?

199
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:51,625
There are many of them going on already.

200
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:52,875
The Facebook post--

201
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,500
If not for this,

202
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:58,000
which other international issue
should we call a strike for?

203
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,291
We are a party that always
stands for the people.

204
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,375
Let's not forget that!

205
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,750
Not a word will change
in what I just said.

206
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:09,166
-Resign, Chief Minister!
-Resign, Chief Minister!

207
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,583
-Resign and leave!
-Resign and leave!

208
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:16,166

210
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:22,958
-End the police atrocities!
-End the police atrocities!

211
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:26,625
-Get out, Kadakkal Chandran!
-Get out, Kadakkal Chandran!

212
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:30,750
-Quit the post, Kadakkal Chandran!
-Quit the post, Kadakkal Chandran!

213
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:34,041
-Resign, Chief Minister!
-Resign, Chief Minister!

214
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:37,708
-Say no to police rule!
-Say no to police rule!

215
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:40,416
-Resign, Chief Minister!
-Resign, Chief Minister!

216
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,333

00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,958
-Say no to police rule!
-Say no to police rule!

219
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,291
Chief Minister Kadakkal Chandran
should resign!

220
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:54,166
-Quit the post, Kadakkal Chandran!
-Quit the post, Kadakkal Chandran!

221
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,583
Watch him burn!
Watch Kadakkal Chandran burn!

222
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:04,625
Watch him burn!
Watch Kadakkal Chandran burn!

223
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:08,000
Watch him burn!
Watch Kadakkal Chandran burn!

224
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,291
Resign, Chief Minister!

225
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,958
Please, don't hit me!

226
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,791
<i>The strike held by the opposition</i>
<i>before the secretariat turned violent.</i>

227
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,416
<i>The protesters who crossed</i>
<i>the police barricades to stop…</i>

228
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,333
Sir!

229
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:00,208
<i>…the CM's car were</i>
<i>beaten by the police.</i>

230
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:01,958
So?

231
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,708
We have located the cafe from
where the post was uploaded, sir.

232
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:07,791
It is right across from the university
college in Saphalyam Complex.

233
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:09,625
It won't be long now.

234
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,000
Sir… how is the Chief Minister?

235
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,041
He is enraged.

236
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:22,041
He called the Director General
of Police in person to give the orders.

237
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,541
No one wants to go near him right now.

238
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:29,083
Okay, sir! We are moving very fast!

239
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:30,958
-You guys better!
-Sir!

240
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:36,125
I was sure it would be
a tough competition!

241
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:39,375
That's why I suggested Adarsh's name.
He has a knack for winning people over.

242
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:43,000
But yes…
their candidate is quite strong.

243
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:07,875
We are not willing to let this
go as an isolated incident.

244
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:11,250
This was a cry of rage from
a tormented section of the populace.

245
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,208
You tell me… what is the justification

246
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:16,791
for such a chief minister
to continue in office?

247
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,875
{\an8}<i>Will the person who posted…</i>

248
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:22,583
{\an8}<i>about the issues caused by</i>
<i>the Chief Minister ever get justice?</i>

249
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:24,541
<i>Tell me!</i>

250
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:27,791
<i>That person is not even brave</i>
<i>enough to put up his name.</i>

251
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,583
<i>Should this be given so much importance?</i>

252
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,583
{\an8}<i>How would one dare</i>
<i>to put up their name, ma'am?</i>

253
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,750
{\an8}<i>Would they spare him if he gets caught?</i>

254
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,833
<i>You sound like someone who</i>
<i>doesn't live in Kerala.</i>

255
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,666
Hey, why are you sitting
so close to the TV?

256
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,416
This is exactly what
the Chief Minister deserves!

257
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,291
So what if he didn't reveal his name?
He is the real man!

258
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:50,916
If I ever see him,
I want to shake his hand.

259
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,583
Are you trying to make me fall?
Stay still!

260
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,375
<i>To protest against this incident,</i>
<i>the opposition has called for</i>

261
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,000
<i>a statewide strike on 18th.</i>

262
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,916
"FACEBOOK POST PART OF PLANNED
CONSPIRACY," SAY POLICE

263
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,041
Hey… you are still awake!

264
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,666
I am really scared.

265
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:20,083
They're showing this news on all the
channels and online media right now.

266
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:21,500
What should I do?

267
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:22,791
Don't worry.

268
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:25,833
All of this will settle down in two days.

269
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,125
<i>Don't get stressed out.</i>

270
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,083
Come and have your tea!

271
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:48,958
Hey!

272
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,458
Please tell your mother
to add more sugar to it.

273
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,333
I have a heart problem,
I don't have diabetes.

274
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,375
Right! That's what's remaining now!

275
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:58,666
Just drink it the way it is!

276
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:02,583
-Have you packed my lunch?
-Yes, hurry up and have breakfast.

277
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:04,250
Aren't you going to college today?

278
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,875
What? Are you planning to loiter again?

279
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:09,916
You need to finish your
studies and get a job quickly.

280
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,083
You know Dad can't work
like he used to anymore.

281
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,083
THE SUSPECT WILL BE CAUGHT SOON- DGP

282
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:28,750
What is it?

283
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:30,833
What is wrong, boy?

284
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,875
What made you write all that?

285
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:38,125
You just said whoever wrote
this, is the real man…

286
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,125
-and that you want to shake his hand.
-That--

287
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,583
That was because I didn't know it was you.

288
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,500
I thought it was someone else!

289
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,625
Dasappan!

290
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,958
-Are you feeling better now?
-Oh, yes!

291
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,250
Are you resuming work today?

292
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,791
-Looks like I'll have plenty of work now.
-Great! Where?

293
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,750
You carry on, Peethambaran.
We are having a serious discussion here.

294
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,666
-Okay.
-It's so sad.

295
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,625
-What are we going to--
-What?

296
00:20:58,708 --> 00:20:59,958
-Dad, I'll see you later.
-Okay.

297
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,833
See you later, bro. I'm getting late.

298
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,750
Hey. Don't let your mother know.

299
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:09,166
She's already worried. If she finds
out about this, that will be it!

300
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:10,916
Seena doesn't need
to know about it either.

301
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,833
-Hey!
-Yes?

302
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,208
-Come and take your medicine!
-Okay, I am coming!

303
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:15,625
Don't worry.

304
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,000
Let me talk to Noorudeen and
see what can be done, okay?

305
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,791
So, you need to see the MLA.
What's it about?

306
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:36,208
It's confidential.
I need to talk to him directly.

307
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:38,583
Does it need to happen today?

308
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:40,500
If we don't see him today,
there will be a big problem.

309
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:42,958
What's this about, brother?
I hope it's not too serious.

310
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:44,583
Is it serious, boy?

311
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:47,791
Come along.

312
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:52,125
Mr. Mathew, this is Councilor Noorudeen.

313
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:54,208
Is the MLA around?

314
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:56,750
Anyway, you should try
going there tomorrow.

315
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:57,666
Okay, sir.

316
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,583
-If there's any problem, call Mathew.
-Alright.

317
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:03,750
And once your issue is settled…

318
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:07,000
we will be expecting a fair share.

319
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:08,208
Sure, sir.

320
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:10,333
-Thank you.
-Alright, then.

321
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,166
-Please, sit.
-Come on, sit.

322
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:22,125
-What is it, Noorudeen?
-Go ahead, tell him what this is about!

323
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,166
I am Dasappan.

324
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:27,208
In the last elections… I voted for you!

325
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:29,041
-Yes, that's true!
-He also voted for you.

326
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:30,833
It was his first-ever vote.

327
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:33,000
He is my son, Sanal.

328
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:38,250
Sir, we're going through some trouble.
We need your help.

329
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:39,708
Tell me.

330
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,916
Sir, in the news,
they're saying that the person…

331
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:45,083
who put up that post against
the Chief Minister will be caught.

332
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,750
-Yeah, the police will catch him.
-Right.

333
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,583
Oh… what will the punishment
be if he gets caught?

334
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:53,958
Punishment? He will never be able to
walk again! Such were the lies he posted!

335
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:56,208
-Tell me why you are here.
-That's right.

336
00:22:58,833 --> 00:22:59,750
It was him.

337
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,125
He wrote that.

338
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:08,291
-Mathew…
-Yes, sir?

339
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,666
-please step out for a minute.
-Let's go out.

340
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:14,958
Are you trying to get me killed?

341
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:16,291
I didn't know all this.

342
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:19,333
How was I supposed to know
what he was going to say!

343
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:21,875
Didn't I ask you a dozen
times what this was about?

344
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:24,916
Could you please help us out?

345
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:27,750
What I should do right now…

346
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:30,208
-is hand you over to the police!
-Please no, sir!

347
00:23:30,416 --> 00:23:31,416
Please don't forsake us.

348
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:34,625
For now… just write
a petition and hand it over.

349
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:36,083
Petition? For this?

350
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:39,041
-People have seen you walk in!
-Oh.

351
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:40,833
If they ask me about
it, what should I say?

352
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:41,875
That's true.

353
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:45,250
Write something about an issue
with a road or water or something.

354
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:48,125
But I have no issues
regarding roads or water--

355
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:50,625
-For heaven's sake, Noorudeen!
-I'll deal with it, sir.

356
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:52,583
Don't worry! What is this, man?

357
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,958
And remember… you've told me nothing,

358
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:58,833
and I've heard nothing.

359
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:09,125
This is serious.

360
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,083
That last line…

361
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:14,875
-where you've said "Watch out"…
-Sir.

362
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:18,333
how could you write all that
against the Chief Minister?

363
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:21,500
That could be interpreted as a threat
to the Chief Minister's life…

364
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:24,416
or that you intend to put him in danger.

365
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:27,208
But sir, I did not intend
to do anything like that.

366
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:30,708
You will be charged with the abetment
of the criminal offenses…

367
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:35,208
that may be done by any other
persons influenced by the post.

368
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,500
Did you understand what I just said, sir?

369
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,583
Well, yes.

370
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:41,291
Their investigation is quite strong.

371
00:24:41,458 --> 00:24:42,791
If they get their hands on you,

372
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,541
you know what it will be like!

373
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:47,625
What should we do now, sir?

374
00:24:52,416 --> 00:24:53,458
There's only one way out.

375
00:24:55,708 --> 00:24:56,541
MYSORE

376
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:02,416
One ticket for Mysore.

377
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:06,583
-Here's the ticket.
-Yeah.

378
00:25:06,666 --> 00:25:09,375
Listen… don't talk to anyone on the bus.

379
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:10,708
And switch off your phone.

380
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,333
Don't be scared.

381
00:25:16,416 --> 00:25:19,958
As I said, Saji has been with
me for almost five years.

382
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:21,625
He'll take care of everything.

383
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,416
Hey, the bus has started.

384
00:25:34,791 --> 00:25:35,750
You can go now, Dad.

385
00:26:47,791 --> 00:26:49,625
<i>And remember… you've told me nothing,</i>

386
00:26:49,916 --> 00:26:51,458
<i>and I've heard nothing.</i>

387
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,666
<i>This is serious.</i>

388
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,625
{\an8}<i>Their investigation is quite strong.</i>

389
00:26:58,708 --> 00:27:00,500
{\an8}<i>If they get their hands on you,</i>

390
00:27:00,583 --> 00:27:02,541
{\an8}<i>you know what it will be like!</i>

391
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:10,208
{\an8}<i>Are you trying to get me killed?</i>

392
00:27:13,125 --> 00:27:16,208
{\an8}<i>Would they spare him if he gets caught?</i>

393
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:32,250
Hello!

394
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:33,833
<i>This is the Chief Minister!</i>

395
00:27:37,583 --> 00:27:38,583
Who?

396
00:27:39,166 --> 00:27:40,250
<i>The Chief Minister!</i>

397
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:25,416
Hey! Stop there!

398
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:28,000
Get him!

399
00:28:35,208 --> 00:28:37,500
I will take care of it.
I've arrived at the location, sir.

400
00:28:37,666 --> 00:28:38,583
Okay!

401
00:28:38,958 --> 00:28:39,916
Yes!

402
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:41,541
Yeah. I'll do it, sir.

403
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,708
Okay, alright.

404
00:28:46,833 --> 00:28:48,916
Don't arrest him.
It's an order from the DGP.

405
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,791
-Sir!
-At 7:00 a.m. tomorrow,

406
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:52,541
you are going to meet the Chief Minister.

407
00:28:52,791 --> 00:28:54,291
You and your father!

408
00:28:56,208 --> 00:28:57,125
Got that?

409
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:01,208
Sir, you can arrest me if you want to,
but don't take me to the Chief Minister.

410
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:02,125
Please!

411
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:04,416
You should've thought about
that before writing such stuff!

412
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,375
This is a direct order
from the Chief Minister.

413
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:08,416
Go and see whatever he
has in store for you.

414
00:29:08,666 --> 00:29:09,541
-Take him.
-Sir!

415
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:11,458
Start walking, boy!

416
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:13,833
If they take you to jail…

417
00:30:14,458 --> 00:30:16,000
we'd at least be able to visit you.

418
00:30:17,708 --> 00:30:20,083
I am worried that he'd ship
you off to Kannur or Viyyur…

419
00:30:20,583 --> 00:30:22,208
if he is so angry with you.

420
00:30:24,375 --> 00:30:25,750
Hey! Come here!

421
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,333
Come.

422
00:31:06,458 --> 00:31:07,416
They are here, sir.

423
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:11,333
Sir, you've been asked to come inside.

424
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,791
-Go.
-Come.

425
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,083
Sit down.

426
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:39,250
Come with me.

427
00:31:40,916 --> 00:31:42,208
Not you, just you.

428
00:31:43,541 --> 00:31:44,791
-Go.
-Goodbye, Dad.

429
00:31:45,083 --> 00:31:47,000
You should say "See you
soon," not "Goodbye."

430
00:31:58,291 --> 00:31:59,250
Come on!

431
00:32:02,458 --> 00:32:03,333
-Hello?
-Yes?

432
00:32:04,333 --> 00:32:05,833
-Come and sit here.
-Yes.

433
00:32:12,958 --> 00:32:13,791
Come, boy!

434
00:32:19,416 --> 00:32:20,250
Sit here.

435
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:23,625
Come on, sit!

436
00:32:59,583 --> 00:33:01,500
So you are the one behind that
post, aren't you?

437
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:44,916
"Only anarchy rules here.

438
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,416
Everywhere you look, there is corruption.

439
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:52,166
If common folks like us don't get
as much value as a party flag…

440
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:54,375
why do we need such a government?

441
00:34:55,458 --> 00:34:59,208
Do we even have representatives
of the people who put the issues

442
00:34:59,791 --> 00:35:01,666
faced by the people above their own?

443
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:04,375
Does this state even
have a chief minister?"

444
00:35:05,791 --> 00:35:07,291
Kerala has a chief minister…

445
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,416
and his name is Kadakkal Chandran!

446
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:13,625
And he, that is I…
am sitting right in front of you!

447
00:35:14,333 --> 00:35:17,125
Sir, I didn't really intend to write it.
It was a mistake on my part.

448
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,791
-Bring the boy.
-Sir!

449
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,875
Come.

450
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:29,208
I said, come!

451
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:31,583
Come in!

452
00:35:53,541 --> 00:35:55,416
Good morning. Is everyone here?

453
00:35:56,958 --> 00:35:59,083
-Come.
-You may sit there.

454
00:36:05,458 --> 00:36:06,791
This is Sanal.

455
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,958
He is the one who posted
on Facebook against me.

456
00:36:12,125 --> 00:36:13,458
The post has not been deleted yet.

457
00:36:13,541 --> 00:36:14,958
Anyone who hasn't read
it can still read it.

458
00:36:15,041 --> 00:36:17,166
This is Dasappan. He is Sanal's father.

459
00:36:17,916 --> 00:36:20,958
It was a problem related
to his hospitalization…

460
00:36:21,041 --> 00:36:23,375
that made Sanal write that Facebook post.

461
00:36:23,916 --> 00:36:25,458
He is better now.

462
00:36:26,208 --> 00:36:27,250
-Aren't you?
-Yes, I am.

463
00:36:27,708 --> 00:36:29,083
Is everyone convinced about that?

464
00:36:29,666 --> 00:36:33,416
The arrangements related to my visit
caused them some inconvenience.

465
00:36:33,916 --> 00:36:36,416
I can't say that
it will never happen again.

466
00:36:36,791 --> 00:36:39,375
If I say that, then it'd be like
a promise that I can't keep.

467
00:36:40,458 --> 00:36:43,041
Because VIPs are different.

468
00:36:44,208 --> 00:36:46,541
But my visit…

469
00:36:47,208 --> 00:36:49,750
to the hospital

470
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,166
or any other public place

471
00:36:51,625 --> 00:36:54,583
will never cause an inconvenience.
Yes, I will try my best.

472
00:36:55,208 --> 00:36:58,875
Also, I apologize
right now…

473
00:36:59,125 --> 00:37:00,750
for all the inconvenience

474
00:37:01,416 --> 00:37:03,333
they faced in the hospital that day.

475
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:09,166
Have some tea before you leave.

476
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:12,000
He has used this chance
to earn some brownie points.

477
00:37:12,666 --> 00:37:13,625
It was a clever move.

478
00:37:13,875 --> 00:37:17,208
We should pick up some other issue now.
This one is out of our hands.

479
00:37:17,291 --> 00:37:20,125
Hey… if we back out now,
it would look like our weakness.

480
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,833
Sir… somebody is calling you.

481
00:37:22,916 --> 00:37:24,208
-Who is it?
-It's Mr. Baby.

482
00:37:24,666 --> 00:37:25,583
Alright.

483
00:37:27,916 --> 00:37:28,750
Hello.

484
00:37:28,958 --> 00:37:29,875
<i>It's nothing like that.</i>

485
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:31,833
<i>So, whom will you vote</i>
<i>for in the next election?</i>

486
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,916
<i>I will vote for the CM's party.</i>

487
00:37:34,041 --> 00:37:38,500
<i>Our country needs chief ministers like</i>
<i>him, who stand for common people like us.</i>

488
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:41,500
The boy is in good form.

489
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:45,541
<i>To be honest, I haven't read it.</i>
<i>And even if I do…</i>

490
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,291
Didn't you have breakfast?

491
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:49,916
Two of Cecily's friends are visiting.

492
00:37:50,958 --> 00:37:52,583
They are going to be there all day.

493
00:37:58,708 --> 00:38:00,333
You seem to be drinking a lot of water.

494
00:38:01,166 --> 00:38:03,291
I've had a urinary infection
for the past two days.

495
00:38:03,791 --> 00:38:04,958
Didn't you go to the doctor?

496
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:07,000
It's okay,
drinking water will take care of it.

497
00:38:07,916 --> 00:38:11,625
No one is paying attention
to anything else other than your apology.

498
00:38:12,041 --> 00:38:13,333
That issue ended right there.

499
00:38:14,416 --> 00:38:15,708
But there is something else…

500
00:38:16,291 --> 00:38:18,666
that needs more of your intervention.

501
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,833
-What is that?
-The strike announced by the opposition.

502
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:26,708
They are planning to go ahead with it.
I have arranged for a meeting.

503
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:29,250
We need to stop it anyhow.

504
00:38:30,125 --> 00:38:31,416
Their strike is not good for us.

505
00:38:33,208 --> 00:38:35,541
Jayanandan will put his
scheming mind to work…

506
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,583
to carry it out and make it a success.

507
00:38:38,208 --> 00:38:40,916
Then, make sure he
doesn't succeed in this.

508
00:38:49,166 --> 00:38:51,416
If you find something wrong, you're
entitled to oppose it or go on strike.

509
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,291
You can organize peaceful protests…

510
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:56,250
but to inconvenience
the public for an entire day

511
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,375
and forcing them to stay home…

512
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,541
makes it a primitive form of protest.

513
00:39:01,041 --> 00:39:03,916
I am hoping that at least a few
of my friends in the opposition

514
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,208
have the civic sense
and common sense to heed my words.

515
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:10,083
I request you to drop the strike plan.

516
00:39:11,791 --> 00:39:16,750
I feel we should respond
favorably to the CM's request.

517
00:39:18,083 --> 00:39:21,583
I mean, we could think of
other means of protest.

518
00:39:21,958 --> 00:39:24,250
But this is something
we have already decided.

519
00:39:24,541 --> 00:39:28,291
Just an apology cannot
save the Chief Minister…

520
00:39:28,458 --> 00:39:29,958
from such serious allegations.

521
00:39:30,041 --> 00:39:33,416
Also, after making a public apology…

522
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,750
the boy might have been taken
aside and intimidated,

523
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:38,708
so the CM could save his skin.
Isn't that a possibility?

524
00:39:38,958 --> 00:39:40,208
What would you say about that?

525
00:39:41,458 --> 00:39:45,166
Do you really think I need to threaten
that puny boy to save myself?

526
00:39:45,958 --> 00:39:48,500
Sugunan, what exactly is the problem here?
There was an issue…

527
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:50,875
but it has been sorted out.
What else do you need?

528
00:39:50,958 --> 00:39:55,000
Mr. Baby, the incident that has
happened is not a trivial one.

529
00:39:55,291 --> 00:39:58,500
The Chief Minister is facing
some serious allegations here!

530
00:39:58,583 --> 00:39:59,958
Let's keep that aside for now.

531
00:40:00,291 --> 00:40:03,916
Tell me, why are you so stubborn
about holding a strike over this?

532
00:40:04,041 --> 00:40:08,333
We're not being stubborn. We don't intend
to bring anything to a standstill either.

533
00:40:08,583 --> 00:40:10,041
You made a mistake.

534
00:40:10,458 --> 00:40:12,500
We just want you to own up to it.

535
00:40:12,916 --> 00:40:16,416
Also… that boy alone is not
the cause for all of this.

536
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:19,125
Felix! Stand up!

537
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:22,291
And Biju… come on in!

538
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,875
Take a good look.

539
00:40:24,166 --> 00:40:26,375
This is the result of
the baton charge that took place

540
00:40:26,458 --> 00:40:28,166
in front of the secretariat the other day.

541
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:30,666
All this is enough to call for a strike…

542
00:40:31,125 --> 00:40:33,708
but what it lacks is freshness.

543
00:40:34,791 --> 00:40:36,416
This year, so far…

544
00:40:36,916 --> 00:40:40,875
we've had two statewide
strikes and 14 local strikes.

545
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,416
They were all called for by you.

546
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,041
Don't dismiss strikes like that!

547
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:46,083
It is a court-approved mode of protests.

548
00:40:46,166 --> 00:40:47,791
Yes! So…

549
00:40:47,958 --> 00:40:50,625
we are going to carry it out
as peacefully as possible!

550
00:40:50,833 --> 00:40:53,875
Has such a thing ever happened
in Kerala's history, Jose?

551
00:40:54,208 --> 00:40:56,291
A peaceful statewide strike?

552
00:40:56,541 --> 00:40:58,958
Maybe we should rethink this.

553
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:03,750
-What is your opinion, Mr. Bhaskaran?
-I…

554
00:41:06,041 --> 00:41:07,708
think we are going to go forward with it.

555
00:41:10,625 --> 00:41:12,625
-And what is your opinion?
-We are a team.

556
00:41:13,166 --> 00:41:14,625
So, my opinion is also the same.

557
00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:19,416
The opposition parties everywhere are
always concerned about…

558
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,791
opposing the ruling
government in every way,

559
00:41:22,375 --> 00:41:24,375
and creating unrest in the land.

560
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:27,375
They believe that increases
the people's trust in them

561
00:41:27,458 --> 00:41:30,416
and decreases the public
faith in the government.

562
00:41:30,791 --> 00:41:32,458
But the opposition isn't really…

563
00:41:33,583 --> 00:41:35,958
an opposite side. It's another side.

564
00:41:36,125 --> 00:41:39,458
The CM is questioning the integrity
of the entire opposition!

565
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:42,666
We didn't come here to get humiliated!

566
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,833
Please, sit down.

567
00:41:44,166 --> 00:41:45,708
-The CM didn't really mean--
-Sir!

568
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:52,875
It was Baby who invited
us to this meeting.

569
00:41:53,458 --> 00:41:54,916
We didn't accept the invitation…

570
00:41:55,625 --> 00:41:57,250
to be ridiculed by you…

571
00:41:57,708 --> 00:41:59,375
or obey your orders!

572
00:42:00,541 --> 00:42:02,958
It's been two years and nine
months since you came to power.

573
00:42:03,458 --> 00:42:06,000
The honeymoon period between us…

574
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:07,958
ends right here.

575
00:42:08,666 --> 00:42:12,208
Whatever exceptions we gave you so far…

576
00:42:12,833 --> 00:42:13,875
don't expect them anymore.

577
00:42:14,541 --> 00:42:17,708
Get a firm grip on the chair
you are sitting on, CM!

578
00:42:19,666 --> 00:42:20,541
Let's go!

579
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:43,166
Whom do you want to meet?

580
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:44,208
The Chief Minister.

581
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,500
-Put your bag in the scanner.
-Okay.

582
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,958
-What is it?
-We want to meet the Chief Minister.

583
00:43:10,291 --> 00:43:11,208
Please wait there.

584
00:43:13,583 --> 00:43:15,916
It's the Excise Minister.
He is getting fried in there.

585
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,208
I have told you many times, Ramachandran.
Don't try…

586
00:43:18,291 --> 00:43:21,083
Let's go and come back later.
The CM is not in a good mood.

587
00:43:21,375 --> 00:43:22,291
That's true.

588
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,333
CM, I know nothing about this!

589
00:43:24,625 --> 00:43:26,500
I need to see all
the papers related to this…

590
00:43:26,583 --> 00:43:28,208
Shall we also come back later?

591
00:43:33,375 --> 00:43:35,000
-What do you want?
-Sir…

592
00:43:35,541 --> 00:43:37,541
Sir, we have an appointment to meet you.

593
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,500
Sir, shall we?

594
00:43:41,666 --> 00:43:43,666
I am heading to a meeting.
Come with me.

595
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,791
We are students of the university college.

596
00:43:49,916 --> 00:43:51,791
I am Remya, the Union Chairperson.

597
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,333
Our college is celebrating
its 153rd anniversary.

598
00:43:55,416 --> 00:43:57,666
Our principal had come
to see you last week.

599
00:43:59,458 --> 00:44:02,041
Yes, it's my college as well.
I am an alumnus. I'll be there.

600
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:06,458
-Why are you here?
-I had come with her.

601
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:08,666
Why? Can't she come alone?

602
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:11,416
-I had come to encourage her.
-Encourage!

603
00:44:12,291 --> 00:44:14,208
A strike is being organized
here because of you!

604
00:44:14,916 --> 00:44:17,666
Do you have any idea how much
that inconveniences the public?

605
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:22,958
Anyone can post anything, but others
have to solve the problems it creates.

606
00:44:23,958 --> 00:44:26,416
Anyhow, both of you wait in my office.

607
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,166
<i>My name is Sanal.</i>

608
00:44:31,625 --> 00:44:32,958
<i>I am a college student.</i>

609
00:44:33,541 --> 00:44:36,750
{\an8}<i>I come from a simple family.</i>
<i>My father is a waiter in a restaurant,</i>

610
00:44:37,125 --> 00:44:38,875
{\an8}<i>and my sister works in a parking lot.</i>

611
00:44:39,458 --> 00:44:41,708
{\an8}<i>Our family lives on their income.</i>

612
00:44:42,125 --> 00:44:45,208
{\an8}<i>If they don't work for a day,</i>
<i>it becomes difficult for us.</i>

613
00:44:45,875 --> 00:44:48,000
{\an8}<i>The CM has given his word</i>
<i>that no action of his</i>

614
00:44:48,083 --> 00:44:50,166
{\an8}<i>will cause any inconvenience to anyone.</i>

615
00:44:50,541 --> 00:44:53,000
{\an8}<i>Now, it is your inaction that</i>
<i>is causing inconvenience to us!</i>

616
00:44:53,291 --> 00:44:55,750
{\an8}<i>I am challenging you, Chief Minister!</i>
<i>On this strike day,</i>

617
00:44:55,958 --> 00:44:58,125
{\an8}<i>can you use your power…</i>

618
00:44:58,208 --> 00:45:01,958
{\an8}<i>to allow life to go on as usual for</i>
<i>the common people of this state?</i>

619
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
STRIKE

620
00:45:08,083 --> 00:45:09,291
WAKE UP, PEOPLE!

621
00:45:16,916 --> 00:45:21,166
SAY NO TO STRIKE

622
00:45:33,583 --> 00:45:35,208
Hey… you!

623
00:45:35,291 --> 00:45:37,833
Who permitted you to open
the shop today? Shut it!

624
00:45:37,916 --> 00:45:39,041
-Hey!
-What?

625
00:45:39,125 --> 00:45:40,208
Shut it!

626
00:45:40,458 --> 00:45:42,916
Hey! Where are you going?
Don't you know it's a strike?

627
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,166
Get lost! Go!

628
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:46,791
Down the shutters!

629
00:45:47,708 --> 00:45:50,250
I'd told you not to take
your child to school today.

630
00:45:50,333 --> 00:45:51,375
Now see what's happening.

631
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,583
Where do you think you are going?

632
00:45:54,208 --> 00:45:55,041
Come out!

633
00:45:55,625 --> 00:45:56,666
-Come out!
-Let go of me!

634
00:45:56,916 --> 00:45:59,250
-Get off!
-Get down!

635
00:46:25,541 --> 00:46:27,833
-Hey! Stop there!
-They do this on every strike day!

636
00:46:53,916 --> 00:46:55,875
How much does this weigh, MLA?
Some 200 gm or so?

637
00:46:57,125 --> 00:46:59,916
You need stones of at least 1-1,5 kg.

638
00:47:00,291 --> 00:47:01,416
That would break the glass.

639
00:47:02,125 --> 00:47:05,208
This glass is not like before.
It's become very strong now.

640
00:47:06,166 --> 00:47:08,833
It is so sad to see the MLAs doing this.

641
00:47:09,416 --> 00:47:11,416
If this strike is for
the benefit of the public,

642
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,375
they'll have to put up
with some inconvenience.

643
00:47:13,458 --> 00:47:14,291
That's true…

644
00:47:14,375 --> 00:47:17,791
but the people who voted for you are
also sitting in there. Don't forget that.

645
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:20,583
When you are fighting
for the citizens' rights,

646
00:47:21,125 --> 00:47:23,708
don't forget about the civic
sense and civic responsibilities.

647
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:26,833
Anyhow, you MLAs would need to spend…

648
00:47:26,916 --> 00:47:29,583
a few days in jail. It is the state
government on the other side.

649
00:47:29,875 --> 00:47:32,041
And I guess you'll have to pay
a fine of 10,000 or so.

650
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:33,875
I am sure you have people to pay for you.

651
00:47:34,208 --> 00:47:35,083
Take them.

652
00:47:35,208 --> 00:47:36,083
But CM--

653
00:47:39,958 --> 00:47:42,750
Aren't there other ways in which
you could have handled this strike?

654
00:47:42,833 --> 00:47:44,708
Isn't this just some cheap heroism, sir?

655
00:47:45,166 --> 00:47:47,041
I did this for the common people.

656
00:47:48,291 --> 00:47:49,833
So, I don't think it's cheap.

657
00:47:50,291 --> 00:47:52,041
You shouldn't think of
it like that either.

658
00:47:52,125 --> 00:47:54,291
Sir, what motivated you to take this step?

659
00:47:55,125 --> 00:47:57,291
I don't need motivation for this.
This is just my job.

660
00:48:04,541 --> 00:48:05,916
Challenging the Chief Minister!

661
00:48:07,708 --> 00:48:10,291
I want you to make
a video challenging me…

662
00:48:10,833 --> 00:48:13,208
and demanding that I take
action against this strike.

663
00:48:13,833 --> 00:48:16,000
Every question you put forward…

664
00:48:16,666 --> 00:48:19,458
should reflect the feelings
of the people of Kerala

665
00:48:19,708 --> 00:48:21,875
against these strikes.

666
00:48:23,375 --> 00:48:26,500
<i>The 12-hour strike called</i>
<i>for by the opposition</i>

667
00:48:26,583 --> 00:48:28,083
<i>is moving towards complete failure!</i>

668
00:48:28,166 --> 00:48:30,666
{\an8}<i>Shops were open everywhere,</i>

669
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:33,000
{\an8}<i>and traffic flowed freely!</i>

670
00:48:33,083 --> 00:48:37,458
<i>Offices and educational institutions</i>
<i>showed normal levels of attendance.</i>

671
00:48:37,708 --> 00:48:40,250
<i>Although a few random acts</i>
<i>of violence were recorded…</i>

672
00:48:40,333 --> 00:48:42,916
<i>the government's strong</i>
<i>response dealt a setback</i>

673
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,083
<i>to the supporters</i>
<i>of the strike and the opposition.</i>

674
00:48:57,708 --> 00:49:00,166
-Hi, Uncle.
-Hey! Look who's here!

675
00:49:01,041 --> 00:49:02,625
When did Uncle's sweetheart get here?

676
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,458
-When did they arrive?
-I'd told her to call you,

677
00:49:05,541 --> 00:49:06,708
-Okay.
-but she wouldn't listen!

678
00:49:06,791 --> 00:49:09,041
She insisted it should be a surprise.

679
00:49:11,041 --> 00:49:12,916
You've grown so big.
Come on, give me a kiss.

680
00:49:13,833 --> 00:49:16,333
It was a spur-of-the-moment
decision to come and visit you.

681
00:49:16,791 --> 00:49:17,750
Where is Satheesh?

682
00:49:17,958 --> 00:49:20,250
He dropped us off and left.
He'll come tomorrow.

683
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:24,333
-Did you have lunch?
-No, I've got food for us.

684
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:26,166
I've made everything you like.

685
00:49:27,625 --> 00:49:29,833
Satheesh has got a job in Canada.

686
00:49:30,625 --> 00:49:32,166
He's planning to leave next month.

687
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:38,541
I've got a small placement as well.

688
00:49:40,166 --> 00:49:42,583
-You never told me about this.
-I did.

689
00:49:42,875 --> 00:49:43,916
Seems like you forgot it.

690
00:49:45,208 --> 00:49:47,083
Dad's death anniversary is on the 28th.

691
00:49:49,083 --> 00:49:50,333
That's the day we are leaving.

692
00:49:57,875 --> 00:49:59,708
Can't you stay here for a couple of days?

693
00:50:00,666 --> 00:50:02,166
No, I have to leave tomorrow.

694
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:03,916
I have some work to do.

695
00:50:04,458 --> 00:50:05,875
Satheesh is also busy.

696
00:50:23,041 --> 00:50:23,875
Stop here, please.

697
00:50:27,166 --> 00:50:29,375
Call the boy who's standing there.
It's Sanal.

698
00:50:29,458 --> 00:50:30,375
Okay, sir.

699
00:50:34,333 --> 00:50:35,291
Sanal!

700
00:50:38,666 --> 00:50:40,458
-Where are you headed?
-Home, sir.

701
00:50:40,875 --> 00:50:41,958
Are you in a hurry?

702
00:50:42,041 --> 00:50:43,291
-No.
-Then, get in.

703
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:45,500
Get in!

704
00:50:57,416 --> 00:50:59,458
-What's in the paper bag?
-Peanuts.

705
00:50:59,875 --> 00:51:00,833
Can I have some?

706
00:51:04,458 --> 00:51:07,250
-Do you eat all this, sir?
-Yeah, why? Wouldn't it go down my throat?

707
00:51:10,208 --> 00:51:11,625
Back when I used to buy peanuts…

708
00:51:12,416 --> 00:51:13,875
it used to cost ten paise per pack.

709
00:51:14,625 --> 00:51:16,125
Have you ever seen a ten-paisa coin?

710
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,208
You don't get it, do you?

711
00:51:36,125 --> 00:51:38,208
It's related to the stuff
you'd written in your post.

712
00:51:38,291 --> 00:51:39,416
My post?

713
00:51:40,208 --> 00:51:43,541
Suppose I need to be removed
from the post of Chief Minister

714
00:51:43,708 --> 00:51:46,291
or an MLA or an MP needs
to be removed from his post…

715
00:51:46,541 --> 00:51:48,583
because you don't like
him, is it possible?

716
00:51:49,208 --> 00:51:50,041
No.

717
00:51:50,458 --> 00:51:55,625
But the people should have the right to
do that. That was the idea of your post.

718
00:51:57,125 --> 00:51:59,666
-I need you to do something for me.
-Me?

719
00:51:59,791 --> 00:52:01,333
-Can't you?
-I can.

720
00:52:01,458 --> 00:52:03,208
I need you to carry out a survey for me.

721
00:52:04,166 --> 00:52:06,875
In all the constituencies in the state,
both parliamentary and assembly,

722
00:52:06,958 --> 00:52:10,166
are voters satisfied with
the performance of their representatives?

723
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:11,708
That's what I need to know.

724
00:52:14,208 --> 00:52:17,583
You can do this with the help of
students from all over the state.

725
00:52:18,166 --> 00:52:19,583
Get your friend's help as well.

726
00:52:19,958 --> 00:52:24,000
Also… no one except the two of you
should know you are doing this for me.

727
00:52:24,083 --> 00:52:25,000
-Yes, sir.
-Okay?

728
00:52:29,041 --> 00:52:32,375
Several times, several people
have brought up this idea…

729
00:52:32,458 --> 00:52:35,125
in Parliament,
but it was never implemented.

730
00:52:35,958 --> 00:52:39,666
They knew if it gets implemented,
it'd be dangerous for them.

731
00:52:39,916 --> 00:52:41,500
That's why it never got implemented.

732
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:43,291
Read this.

733
00:52:44,791 --> 00:52:47,458
These are some of the very
good writings on the subject.

734
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:51,083
This was a sudden thought
that occurred to Sanal.

735
00:52:51,166 --> 00:52:54,291
To remove the elected representatives from
office before the end of their term.

736
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:57,083
Why the sudden interest in this field?

737
00:52:57,166 --> 00:52:59,833
I like writing, and this
time, I wanted to write…

738
00:52:59,916 --> 00:53:01,916
something on an interesting topic.

739
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Of course!

740
00:53:03,458 --> 00:53:05,208
It is a very live topic, you know!

741
00:53:05,708 --> 00:53:07,500
-Good selection!
-Thank you, sir!

742
00:53:08,166 --> 00:53:10,041
But this thought…

743
00:53:10,583 --> 00:53:12,250
had occurred to someone else in Kerala

744
00:53:13,125 --> 00:53:14,625
a long time before you, Sanal.

745
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:16,833
Who's that, Grandpa?

746
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,416
This is from 1987.

747
00:53:20,333 --> 00:53:21,500
Your then college magazine.

748
00:53:22,958 --> 00:53:23,958
Do you know this person?

749
00:53:29,125 --> 00:53:29,958
Oh, my God!

750
00:53:30,041 --> 00:53:33,708
"THE RIGHTS OF VOTERS"
BY NARAYANAN CHANDRAN

751
00:53:35,541 --> 00:53:37,750
My most famous friend.

752
00:53:39,041 --> 00:53:41,541
Chandran and Baby were
the stars of the college.

753
00:53:42,416 --> 00:53:44,416
Baby is the Head of the Party now.

754
00:53:45,208 --> 00:53:47,625
But they were also known…

755
00:53:47,708 --> 00:53:49,750
as "ruffians" in the college at the time.

756
00:53:50,875 --> 00:53:53,166
But their political views were brilliant.

757
00:53:53,375 --> 00:53:56,291
Especially, Chandran's.
He was a voracious reader.

758
00:53:56,583 --> 00:53:58,833
Once in a scuffle in college…

759
00:53:59,166 --> 00:54:01,166
when I say scuffle,
I mean a political one.

760
00:54:01,625 --> 00:54:03,625
…Chandran got hit on the head.

761
00:54:04,625 --> 00:54:07,666
He lay unconscious in the
hospital for three days.

762
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,250
But he came out of it.

763
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:14,000
And now, he is…
the Chief Minister of Kerala.

764
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,208
Sir, they are…

765
00:54:21,916 --> 00:54:23,750
Go and meet the Public Works Secretary.

766
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:24,833
I'll put in a word.

767
00:54:24,916 --> 00:54:26,666
We'd like you to come
for the inauguration.

768
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:28,708
First, let the work get done.
Then, we'll see.

769
00:54:30,666 --> 00:54:31,583
Morning, sir!

770
00:54:34,916 --> 00:54:36,583
Sir, I have an urgent matter to discuss.

771
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:53,666
This is something that'd
affect you and your government.

772
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:56,583
That's why I thought I should
ask you before making a decision.

773
00:54:56,916 --> 00:54:58,916
-You can proceed with it.
-Are you sure?

774
00:54:59,708 --> 00:55:01,791
Why do you seem to be
lacking confidence, Alex?

775
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:06,250
I have had three suspensions, sir.
You know that already.

776
00:55:07,333 --> 00:55:10,333
I no longer think that
the post of Vigilance Director…

777
00:55:10,541 --> 00:55:12,083
is meant for an act of heroism.

778
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:14,875
I am scared to do anything…

779
00:55:15,333 --> 00:55:17,333
without thinking about
who and what is involved.

780
00:55:18,666 --> 00:55:22,291
Does your rule book require you
to first check who and what is involved?

781
00:55:22,791 --> 00:55:24,916
How much of your service is left?

782
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:27,583
Two years and eight
months of service, sir.

783
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:30,916
I don't know for how long
I will be the Chief Minister,

784
00:55:31,208 --> 00:55:34,000
but you must complete your service…

785
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:36,375
until the end, okay?

786
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:39,125
Thank you, sir.

787
00:55:40,916 --> 00:55:43,666
The tax receipts and prior deeds
were given long back, Kunjachan!

788
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,083
They are dragging it on for no reason!

789
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:50,375
Listen to me very carefully!
This is my man we're talking about!

790
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,125
Just get it done, okay?

791
00:55:56,541 --> 00:55:58,916
It's nothing…
just a small delay with the ROR.

792
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,125
In will sort out in two days.

793
00:56:05,583 --> 00:56:08,083
Hello. Sir is in a meeting right now.

794
00:56:08,416 --> 00:56:09,750
Please call back in 15 minutes.

795
00:56:10,083 --> 00:56:10,916
Okay.

796
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:21,375
I should have just come to you first.

797
00:56:21,708 --> 00:56:24,583
I've been doing the rounds of so
many offices for eight months now.

798
00:56:26,083 --> 00:56:28,416
You know, this red-tapism issue…

799
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:31,083
is the biggest curse of this land.

800
00:56:44,791 --> 00:56:45,750
Sit.

801
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:48,875
Take it.

802
00:56:53,708 --> 00:56:55,583
-It's 25, right?
-Yes, sir.

803
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:02,375
Don't worry, Rajagopal. Okay?

804
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,041
Here's the money.

805
00:57:05,083 --> 00:57:06,000
Sir!

806
00:57:07,083 --> 00:57:08,791
What? What is it?

807
00:57:11,458 --> 00:57:13,541
-What is this, man?
-We have an arrest warrant, sir.

808
00:57:14,083 --> 00:57:15,416
Cooperate with us, please.

809
00:57:19,791 --> 00:57:22,958
You know, I heard they are
looking for someone to head…

810
00:57:23,333 --> 00:57:26,166
the Coconut Development Board and
Cashew Development Corporation.

811
00:57:27,708 --> 00:57:29,583
Which one would you like? Tell me.

812
00:57:32,541 --> 00:57:33,958
You don't have to call the CM, sir.

813
00:57:34,416 --> 00:57:35,250
He knows about this.

814
00:57:36,875 --> 00:57:39,875
<i>The Revenue Minister, M. J. Kuriakose,</i>
<i>is under arrest.</i>

815
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:42,333
{\an8}<i>It was in the Vizhinjam</i>
<i>Government Guest House</i>

816
00:57:42,416 --> 00:57:44,166
{\an8}<i>that the Minister was taken into</i>
<i>custody by vigilance officials.</i>

817
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:46,708
<i>A resident of Karamana filed</i>
<i>a complaint because of which,</i>

818
00:57:47,083 --> 00:57:50,041
<i>this action was taken directly</i>
<i>by the Vigilance Director.</i>

819
00:57:50,125 --> 00:57:52,916
<i>Though it is certain that Kuriakose</i>
<i>will lose his ministerial berth,</i>

820
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,458
<i>he may not resign from his MLA post.</i>

821
00:57:54,541 --> 00:57:57,333
<i>He was arrested while taking</i>
<i>a bribe of Rs. 20 lakh.</i>

822
00:57:57,416 --> 00:58:01,083
<i>His personal secretary, Manoj Raveendran,</i>
<i>who was with him was also arrested.</i>

823
00:58:01,333 --> 00:58:03,791
<i>The Vigilance Director, Alex Thomas…</i>

824
00:58:03,875 --> 00:58:05,791
<i>personally led the arrest operation.</i>

825
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:09,583
{\an8}<i>Though it is certain that Kuriakose</i>
<i>will lose his ministerial post,</i>

826
00:58:09,708 --> 00:58:13,500
{\an8}<i>no moves are indicating that he will</i>
<i>give up his position as the MLA.</i>

827
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
GOVERNMENT OF KERALA

828
00:58:43,291 --> 00:58:45,958
The top promise in our
election manifesto…

829
00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:49,625
was a corruption-free government.

830
00:58:50,291 --> 00:58:52,041
To keep that promise…

831
00:58:52,625 --> 00:58:55,833
we had to take a bold step,
which led to Kuriakose's arrest.

832
00:58:56,750 --> 00:58:59,750
Mr. Baby… Mr. Kuriakose may
have lost his ministership,

833
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
but he is still an MLA and our leader!

834
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:05,291
You are in power because of his support.

835
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:08,541
If he asks us to,
we will all resign from our MLA posts.

836
00:59:09,125 --> 00:59:11,666
Thereafter, your survival will
hinge on a single MLA's support.

837
00:59:11,791 --> 00:59:13,666
We can't help saying it, CM…

838
00:59:14,041 --> 00:59:15,500
but this was like backstabbing us.

839
00:59:15,625 --> 00:59:17,416
What else should we have
done, Gopalakrishnan?

840
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,791
Tell me. Should we have called
him beforehand to warn him

841
00:59:19,875 --> 00:59:21,583
that the vigilance is coming to raid him?

842
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:23,625
Hey! Stop it, Mr. Baby!

843
00:59:24,083 --> 00:59:26,833
You need some exposure
and experience to handle these matters!

844
00:59:27,208 --> 00:59:28,250
When we put…

845
00:59:28,333 --> 00:59:29,208
what do you call it?

846
00:59:29,291 --> 00:59:32,750
…overnight successes in key
positions, this is what happens!

847
00:59:33,625 --> 00:59:37,250
CM… we can't just go by
the law and ethics here.

848
00:59:37,541 --> 00:59:39,875
The most important thing
in politics is survival!

849
00:59:39,958 --> 00:59:42,541
If you slip up…

850
00:59:42,833 --> 00:59:45,291
we will go back to being the opposition.

851
00:59:45,375 --> 00:59:48,208
That was already the case even before
we got here, right, Ramachandran?

852
00:59:48,291 --> 00:59:50,541
When you say "our survival," you
really mean your personal survival.

853
00:59:50,625 --> 00:59:52,166
-That's all.
-Mr. Baby!

854
00:59:52,708 --> 00:59:54,125
Be careful with your words!

855
00:59:54,583 --> 00:59:56,875
You need to show some
respect to a senior leader!

856
00:59:57,375 --> 01:00:00,000
By senior if you mean a person responsible
for the most number of political moves,

857
01:00:00,083 --> 01:00:02,000
then I have a lot of respect for him.

858
01:00:02,375 --> 01:00:03,208
Got it?

859
01:00:03,291 --> 01:00:05,541
You need to show more dignity
when you speak, Mr. Baby!

860
01:00:07,833 --> 01:00:11,250
What dignity are you talking about?
What the party says, you should obey!

861
01:00:14,458 --> 01:00:15,500
Stop it!

862
01:00:22,375 --> 01:00:24,916
It isn't just Kuriakose, Mr. Ramachandran.

863
01:00:25,416 --> 01:00:27,125
There are complaints against you as well.

864
01:00:27,916 --> 01:00:29,541
MLA Karyavattam Sreekumar,

865
01:00:29,791 --> 01:00:31,916
MLA Jacob Chethimattam,

866
01:00:32,083 --> 01:00:33,625
the opposition MLA, P. Sugunan…

867
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:35,958
they have complaints against all of them.

868
01:00:36,291 --> 01:00:38,291
I am ordering an investigation anyhow.

869
01:00:38,875 --> 01:00:41,250
If found guilty,
there will be consequences.

870
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:44,958
Also, the names on
the list might increase.

871
01:00:47,625 --> 01:00:49,916
We got that when we saw
the Chief Secretary seated here.

872
01:00:50,291 --> 01:00:53,291
That is not a regular practice. There
is something you should understand, CM.

873
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:55,375
For us, the party is above all.

874
01:00:56,083 --> 01:01:00,000
The party is far above our
personal interests and principles.

875
01:01:01,208 --> 01:01:02,916
How many members are there in our party?

876
01:01:03,625 --> 01:01:04,458
What?

877
01:01:04,541 --> 01:01:06,541
I asked, how many members
are there in our party?

878
01:01:09,625 --> 01:01:10,875
-Fifteen lakh.
-What?

879
01:01:11,291 --> 01:01:12,208
Fifteen lakh.

880
01:01:13,166 --> 01:01:14,125
Fifteen lakh members.

881
01:01:14,458 --> 01:01:17,500
I am not the Chief Minister for
these 15 lakh members alone.

882
01:01:18,375 --> 01:01:21,875
I am the Chief Minister for all
the 3,5 crore people of Kerala.

883
01:01:22,875 --> 01:01:25,708
So then, whose side should I stand on?

884
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Being an overnight success…
is something I am sometimes praised for,

885
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,250
and sometimes ridiculed
for, but Mukkadan…

886
01:01:37,083 --> 01:01:39,333
it took me 32 years,

887
01:01:39,916 --> 01:01:43,166
and seven months to become
an overnight success.

888
01:01:45,083 --> 01:01:47,250
To have people in our government,

889
01:01:47,333 --> 01:01:50,125
who spoil the good name of
the party and its heritage…

890
01:01:51,125 --> 01:01:53,916
is something that I,
as the Chief Minister will not allow.

891
01:01:57,541 --> 01:02:00,291
CM, we all are right here.

892
01:02:01,375 --> 01:02:03,791
Would you dare to sign this
file right here in front of us?

893
01:02:06,041 --> 01:02:07,250
I am asking you something.

894
01:03:27,333 --> 01:03:29,833
See how he faltered when
things started to get real!

895
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:58,500
What is it, sir?

896
01:03:59,208 --> 01:04:01,000
My office…

897
01:04:02,333 --> 01:04:03,541
Sir, it's on the third floor.

898
01:05:22,833 --> 01:05:23,708
Sir!

899
01:05:47,541 --> 01:05:50,000
Sir, do you want these
files to be forwarded?

900
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:51,125
I'll inform you.

901
01:07:07,625 --> 01:07:10,750
Does this have anything to do with
that head injury he had suffered?

902
01:07:11,041 --> 01:07:13,041
Maybe… that's all I can say.

903
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:14,875
And also,

904
01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:17,750
the last time I saw him like this…

905
01:07:18,333 --> 01:07:22,166
was when the father of the boy
who put up the Facebook post…

906
01:07:22,833 --> 01:07:24,375
had been admitted to the hospital.

907
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:27,375
Chandran had a headache that day as well.

908
01:07:28,208 --> 01:07:29,708
So, that issue and today's issue…

909
01:07:30,458 --> 01:07:32,125
might be related.

910
01:07:37,875 --> 01:07:41,166
He takes his daily medicine
only once a week, doesn't he?

911
01:07:41,541 --> 01:07:43,541
That too, as if, he is doing
someone else a favor.

912
01:07:44,416 --> 01:07:46,750
Here… have tea.

913
01:07:56,458 --> 01:07:59,166
It was ten minutes later that you
remembered your signature, right?

914
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,125
It's a significant duration.

915
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:06,000
We need to make sure this doesn't
happen again and for that…

916
01:08:06,083 --> 01:08:08,291
you need to pay more attention.

917
01:08:08,416 --> 01:08:11,291
-I'll take care of the rest--
-What are these plants called?

918
01:08:15,916 --> 01:08:19,041
I am a fool for attempting
to advise a guy like this.

919
01:08:27,958 --> 01:08:30,791
You need a detailed evaluation.

920
01:08:31,916 --> 01:08:35,375
I know how busy you are, but you are
not the same age as you were in college.

921
01:08:36,166 --> 01:08:39,041
Your body should be able
to keep up with your mind always.

922
01:08:40,458 --> 01:08:41,416
Chandran.

923
01:08:42,791 --> 01:08:45,375
People can help you with everything else,

924
01:08:45,875 --> 01:08:48,250
but when it comes to your health…

925
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:50,458
you need to take care of yourself.

926
01:09:07,208 --> 01:09:09,750
Brother, we don't need breakfast.
We have to get to Kollam by eight o'clock.

927
01:09:09,833 --> 01:09:11,333
-Is the child asleep?
-Yes.

928
01:09:11,416 --> 01:09:14,375
We decided to make another trip here
before leaving, for brother's sake.

929
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:20,125
-Doesn't Baby visit him, Brother Ibrahim?
-He does. He comes here almost every day.

930
01:09:20,916 --> 01:09:23,041
Today, he'd gone with
Chandran to see a doctor.

931
01:09:24,875 --> 01:09:27,000
Well, when you were in high school…

932
01:09:27,333 --> 01:09:29,375
your brother suffered
a minor memory lapse.

933
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:32,583
We thought it would never happen
again, but this morning, it did.

934
01:09:33,125 --> 01:09:34,791
The doctor said he's fine.

935
01:09:35,166 --> 01:09:37,166
And we are all here, aren't we?

936
01:09:38,583 --> 01:09:40,125
I will be going away soon, brother.

937
01:09:41,041 --> 01:09:43,041
Had he married at the right age,

938
01:09:43,291 --> 01:09:45,625
I'd have had that comfort, at least.
But now, it's like…

939
01:09:46,083 --> 01:09:47,416
You must be kidding!

940
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:51,291
He always says marriage
is a big complication…

941
01:09:51,708 --> 01:09:54,708
but on the other hand, he's okay with
every other complication in his life.

942
01:09:55,333 --> 01:09:58,041
In his position though,
I guess that is needed.

943
01:10:25,708 --> 01:10:26,791
Sir, it's the DGP.

944
01:10:29,583 --> 01:10:30,416
Hello?

945
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:32,000
<i>It was around 7:00 in the morning,</i>

946
01:10:32,083 --> 01:10:34,416
{\an8}<i>when this shocking incident</i>
<i>occurred in the state.</i>

947
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:37,416
{\an8}<i>Many vehicles were crossing</i>
<i>the bridge when it collapsed.</i>

948
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:40,458
{\an8}<i>According to the reports coming</i>
<i>in, around 12 people have died.</i>

949
01:10:40,666 --> 01:10:43,625
{\an8}<i>Six out of the 40 injured are</i>
<i>said to be in a serious state.</i>

950
01:10:43,708 --> 01:10:46,041
{\an8}<i>At the accident site,</i>
<i>the district administration is leading</i>

951
01:10:46,125 --> 01:10:48,041
<i>rescue operations as we speak.</i>

952
01:10:52,333 --> 01:10:54,708
<i>News reports are coming in…</i>

953
01:10:54,791 --> 01:10:57,041
<i>about massive corruption in the</i>
<i>construction of this bridge.</i>

954
01:10:57,125 --> 01:10:59,541
<i>Rescue operations are still underway…</i>

955
01:10:59,625 --> 01:11:03,541
<i>under the supervision of</i>
<i>the district administration.</i>

956
01:11:26,416 --> 01:11:27,250
Sir!

957
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:29,250
Don't block the way.
Let the ambulance pass.

958
01:11:29,333 --> 01:11:30,166
Okay.

959
01:11:37,708 --> 01:11:39,958
Sir, two people have died on the spot.

960
01:11:40,041 --> 01:11:42,333
Around four to five people
are seriously injured.

961
01:11:42,416 --> 01:11:46,125
There are around 25-30 casualties
in total, including children.

962
01:11:50,583 --> 01:11:53,208
-Call for more force if you need it.
-They are on their way, sir.

963
01:11:53,625 --> 01:11:55,750
Sir, this bridge was
constructed under your tenure.

964
01:11:55,833 --> 01:11:57,375
What do you have to say about this?

965
01:11:58,666 --> 01:12:01,125
-Which hospital?
-They've been taken to the NIMS Hospital.

966
01:12:07,875 --> 01:12:10,250
He said he wants to speak with you.
It's going to be rough.

967
01:12:32,583 --> 01:12:34,666
Has the CM asked you to resign?

968
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:37,291
Do you take responsibility
for all of this?

969
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,083
Accident victims are still
being brought in, Sir.

970
01:12:40,333 --> 01:12:41,833
Most of them have bad injuries.

971
01:12:41,916 --> 01:12:44,041
Two of them have been taken
for emergency surgery.

972
01:12:44,875 --> 01:12:46,208
Tell me what you need.

973
01:12:47,875 --> 01:12:49,166
-Don't worry about the expenses.
-Yes, sir.

974
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:51,083
-Make sure everyone gets what they need.
-Sir.

975
01:12:52,291 --> 01:12:54,541
Just send the health secretary
for the meeting.

976
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,250
Get here immediately, Minister!

977
01:13:01,916 --> 01:13:03,833
Your MLA fund was also used in
the construction, right?

978
01:13:03,916 --> 01:13:04,833
Yes, sir.

979
01:13:05,125 --> 01:13:07,958
There are discrepancies in many
of the papers and the materials.

980
01:13:08,041 --> 01:13:11,291
No, sir. Everything was accurate.
The papers, the materials and everything.

981
01:13:11,875 --> 01:13:13,875
Then, how can the proportion
of seven sacks of cement

982
01:13:13,958 --> 01:13:16,041
per three sacks of sand get mixed up?
Tell me.

983
01:13:17,166 --> 01:13:20,458
Yesterday, I got the intelligence report
regarding the corruption

984
01:13:20,541 --> 01:13:21,833
behind this bridge construction.

985
01:13:22,833 --> 01:13:24,583
Before I could do anything… anyway.

986
01:13:26,041 --> 01:13:28,625
You've pocketed three crore rupees
out of this project, Rajan!

987
01:13:28,708 --> 01:13:31,875
-Sir--
-Listen. I have evidence!

988
01:13:32,750 --> 01:13:35,916
Mr. Baby, when there is a crisis,
we should put up a united front.

989
01:13:36,375 --> 01:13:38,541
We cannot just pay some compensation

990
01:13:38,625 --> 01:13:41,583
to the families of the victims
and put an end to the matter!

991
01:13:42,791 --> 01:13:44,375
You have to resign from your MLA post!

992
01:13:46,125 --> 01:13:47,250
CM, what are you…

993
01:13:49,166 --> 01:13:51,958
Let the inquiry be done first.
Can't the resignation wait until then?

994
01:13:52,166 --> 01:13:55,333
If you have even an ounce of
ethics, you should leave the post.

995
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,083
If I were a minister,
you could have asked me to step down.

996
01:14:00,458 --> 01:14:02,250
That is your power
and privilege as the CM.

997
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:04,875
But the position of MLA was
given to me by the people.

998
01:14:04,958 --> 01:14:08,458
My constituents can ask me
to resign from my post…

999
01:14:08,666 --> 01:14:09,541
but you can't, CM.

1000
01:14:10,791 --> 01:14:11,750
I am leaving.

1001
01:14:19,375 --> 01:14:21,000
You need to be a bit more practical.

1002
01:14:21,625 --> 01:14:23,208
What's wrong with waiting a bit more?

1003
01:14:24,291 --> 01:14:26,958
If we wait,
it'd only be beneficial to him.

1004
01:14:27,041 --> 01:14:28,625
That's why.

1005
01:14:28,916 --> 01:14:30,666
You have a very safe position…

1006
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
that offers you a lot of privilege.

1007
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:36,625
It is easy to preach ethics
from that vantage point,

1008
01:14:37,333 --> 01:14:39,333
but bringing all these
elements together…

1009
01:14:40,125 --> 01:14:41,041
is my job.

1010
01:14:42,416 --> 01:14:43,583
And it's a horrible job.

1011
01:14:44,916 --> 01:14:47,083
I stood by you when it
came to Kuriakose…

1012
01:14:48,125 --> 01:14:50,125
but you don't know the kind of trouble…

1013
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:53,125
I had to take to keep
him and his MLAs with us.

1014
01:14:53,541 --> 01:14:54,916
One thing's for sure, Chandran.

1015
01:14:55,458 --> 01:14:57,791
You'll have to be very careful
while making any decision.

1016
01:14:58,583 --> 01:14:59,541
If your decisions…

1017
01:15:00,125 --> 01:15:03,250
are in any way a threat
to the party or its survival,

1018
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:05,666
I will not stand with you.

1019
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:20,791
Sir!

1020
01:15:21,125 --> 01:15:23,875
It's my sister's wedding.
I'd really like it if you could attend it.

1021
01:15:26,083 --> 01:15:28,000
Why did you bring it up now?

1022
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:15,666
The Representation of the
People (Amendment) Bill…

1023
01:16:16,083 --> 01:16:17,250
or the Right to Recall.

1024
01:16:18,291 --> 01:16:20,958
If unsatisfied with the performance of
their elected representative,

1025
01:16:21,041 --> 01:16:23,083
voters have the right
to recall their representative

1026
01:16:23,166 --> 01:16:25,625
before the end of their five-year tenure.

1027
01:16:26,041 --> 01:16:29,625
If 50% or more of
the voters in a constituency…

1028
01:16:30,041 --> 01:16:33,416
file a petition against their elected
representative before the speaker…

1029
01:16:34,375 --> 01:16:37,375
with the permission of the Election
Commission, fresh polls can be held there.

1030
01:16:37,458 --> 01:16:41,458
Sir, bearing in mind the importance
and greatness of such a bill…

1031
01:16:41,958 --> 01:16:43,166
and with all due respect…

1032
01:16:44,333 --> 01:16:45,708
I'd like to say something.

1033
01:16:46,083 --> 01:16:48,041
This is not practical for our country.

1034
01:16:48,625 --> 01:16:50,625
It is! It is quite practical!

1035
01:16:51,083 --> 01:16:53,333
Just our bill needs to pass
in Parliament…

1036
01:16:53,416 --> 01:16:56,208
by both the Houses and then,
it needs to be signed by the President.

1037
01:16:56,666 --> 01:16:59,000
Any interested state can
attempt to put it into practice.

1038
01:16:59,458 --> 01:17:03,208
That may take even
an amendment of the constitution.

1039
01:17:03,958 --> 01:17:06,375
I am not sure. Let me verify that.
Then, I will let you know.

1040
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:11,458
We are not questioning the tenure
of the elected representatives.

1041
01:17:12,250 --> 01:17:14,125
What we intend is for the voters…

1042
01:17:14,208 --> 01:17:18,708
if unsatisfied with their performance,
to have the right to recall those people.

1043
01:17:19,416 --> 01:17:22,375
That does not require
a constitutional amendment.

1044
01:17:23,833 --> 01:17:25,583
Sir, I support you on this.

1045
01:17:27,458 --> 01:17:29,916
This is definitely something
the voters would look forward to.

1046
01:17:31,708 --> 01:17:33,416
But when we come to reality…

1047
01:17:34,208 --> 01:17:36,916
the minute I present this
before Parliament,

1048
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:38,416
it is bound to be rejected.

1049
01:17:39,583 --> 01:17:41,208
This has been the history of this bill.

1050
01:17:43,333 --> 01:17:45,041
Why put ourselves up for embarrassment?

1051
01:17:45,666 --> 01:17:48,666
Far more embarrassing things have
happened in our parliament and assemblies.

1052
01:17:48,750 --> 01:17:51,625
Trying to do something good
and failing also has its thrills.

1053
01:17:55,916 --> 01:17:57,083
What does democracy mean?

1054
01:17:58,291 --> 01:17:59,125
Tell me.

1055
01:18:00,791 --> 01:18:03,416
One day out of every five years,
you get to cast your vote.

1056
01:18:05,041 --> 01:18:08,333
Unfortunately, that is what
"democracy" means in our country.

1057
01:18:09,791 --> 01:18:11,958
For that day, just for that one day…

1058
01:18:12,541 --> 01:18:14,083
it is the people who decide things.

1059
01:18:14,666 --> 01:18:15,666
Once that is over,

1060
01:18:16,041 --> 01:18:18,000
the very people who humbly asked
the public to vote for them

1061
01:18:18,083 --> 01:18:19,250
change their tone and style.

1062
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:24,000
For five years, they can get away with
anything because of the power they get.

1063
01:18:24,208 --> 01:18:27,541
And for those five years, the public has
to put up with them and whatever they do.

1064
01:18:33,791 --> 01:18:36,791
Whatever we talked about just now
should remain among ourselves.

1065
01:18:38,666 --> 01:18:40,958
A fourth person should not be part of it.

1066
01:18:41,625 --> 01:18:42,583
Yes, sir.

1067
01:18:46,625 --> 01:18:48,583
I've heard,
some places like Switzerland…

1068
01:18:48,916 --> 01:18:51,458
already practice whatever
the CM was talking about.

1069
01:18:52,333 --> 01:18:54,958
But here, it's… I don't know.

1070
01:18:55,833 --> 01:18:58,458
Why did the CM want
to keep this confidential?

1071
01:18:58,541 --> 01:19:00,125
Why all this secrecy?

1072
01:19:00,875 --> 01:19:03,916
There's some stuff that only he knows.

1073
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:06,291
-Why didn't you ask him?
-Oh, no.

1074
01:19:06,375 --> 01:19:07,666
Forget I said anything.

1075
01:19:11,833 --> 01:19:12,666
Yes. Thank you, sir.

1076
01:19:19,875 --> 01:19:22,708
Tell me when he arrives. I don't want
him to think I stood up upon seeing him.

1077
01:19:22,791 --> 01:19:23,708
Oh, okay.

1078
01:19:28,208 --> 01:19:29,333
Sir, he's coming.

1079
01:19:54,166 --> 01:19:56,000
First, I thought I'd call
before coming here…

1080
01:19:56,083 --> 01:19:58,750
but then I thought you might say no.
So, I came without informing.

1081
01:20:00,958 --> 01:20:03,916
Having high blood pressure and diabetes
sometimes work to your advantage.

1082
01:20:04,208 --> 01:20:06,708
For instance,
I got bail because they were high.

1083
01:20:10,041 --> 01:20:13,041
The reason I came here is that I wanted
to tell you something to your face.

1084
01:20:14,916 --> 01:20:16,916
I heard you are planning
a big cleanup operation.

1085
01:20:17,166 --> 01:20:18,125
It's a good thing…

1086
01:20:18,875 --> 01:20:23,083
but if you touch any of my MLAs…
things will turn, Chandran.

1087
01:20:23,875 --> 01:20:27,833
You're not thick-skinned
to be a turncoat… but I am.

1088
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:30,125
I thought I should remind you about that.

1089
01:20:30,750 --> 01:20:33,208
I know you don't take sugar,
but would you like some tea?

1090
01:20:35,416 --> 01:20:36,375
Or maybe coffee?

1091
01:20:36,875 --> 01:20:37,750
No!

1092
01:20:38,875 --> 01:20:42,541
Didn't you also take an oath before
the Governor when you became the minister?

1093
01:20:44,083 --> 01:20:45,125
-What? Didn't you?
-I did.

1094
01:20:45,375 --> 01:20:46,791
Does it say anywhere in that oath

1095
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:49,250
that you will continue to be
the minister for five years?

1096
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:50,375
No.

1097
01:20:50,833 --> 01:20:51,833
Neither did mine.

1098
01:20:53,208 --> 01:20:55,458
So Kuriakose, go ahead and sell…

1099
01:20:55,541 --> 01:20:57,625
or auction off or whatever else
you want to do with your MLAs.

1100
01:20:57,708 --> 01:21:00,083
There is a great demand for
people like them, especially…

1101
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:01,583
when they form a coalition.

1102
01:21:02,625 --> 01:21:05,875
What you said is true.
I have not become thick-skinned yet…

1103
01:21:06,208 --> 01:21:09,333
to be a turncoat or survive at any cost.
I don't have the skills for that.

1104
01:21:10,083 --> 01:21:13,291
And the day I feel I do, I will
step away from my political career.

1105
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:15,875
Because if I gain those qualifications,

1106
01:21:15,958 --> 01:21:18,791
there would be no difference
between me and you!

1107
01:21:19,583 --> 01:21:22,000
I'll have to take your leave now.
I have a program at 10:30.

1108
01:21:22,250 --> 01:21:23,583
Please have tea before you leave.

1109
01:22:09,166 --> 01:22:10,000
Sir…

1110
01:22:10,833 --> 01:22:13,166
they're the guys from the distillery
we raided and sealed last week.

1111
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:14,666
We'll have it cleared right away.

1112
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:16,500
Make it fast!

1113
01:22:34,041 --> 01:22:34,875
Sir!

1114
01:22:35,541 --> 01:22:36,958
Get there after this gets cleared.

1115
01:22:37,041 --> 01:22:40,208
-Sir, please--
-If I am not scared, why should you be?

1116
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:41,375
I'll go on my own.

1117
01:23:26,708 --> 01:23:27,958
-Come on, let's go!
-Where to?

1118
01:23:28,041 --> 01:23:29,125
The university college.

1119
01:23:31,958 --> 01:23:34,666
The number is KL01S159.
The CM has boarded the auto-rickshaw

1120
01:23:34,750 --> 01:23:37,208
to go to the university college
from in front of the palace.

1121
01:23:37,333 --> 01:23:38,833
All the roads are blocked today, sir.

1122
01:23:38,916 --> 01:23:40,833
In any case,
because of the condition of the road,

1123
01:23:40,916 --> 01:23:42,583
a ten-minute ride takes half an hour!

1124
01:23:43,333 --> 01:23:44,166
Oh, no!

1125
01:23:44,791 --> 01:23:46,625
Can't they at least fix these potholes?

1126
01:23:47,375 --> 01:23:49,166
My bones are getting
rattled because of this.

1127
01:23:49,250 --> 01:23:51,500
None of the byroads are
in good condition either.

1128
01:23:52,541 --> 01:23:55,416
We're just fed up with giving petition
after petition to the municipality

1129
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:56,458
and the MLAs.

1130
01:23:58,125 --> 01:24:00,750
Right now, they are all so
engrossed in tormenting those guys.

1131
01:24:01,208 --> 01:24:03,333
-Who?
-The Public Works people.

1132
01:24:05,083 --> 01:24:07,500
They bother about us only
when the elections are near.

1133
01:24:08,166 --> 01:24:09,875
After that, no one gives a damn about us.

1134
01:24:11,625 --> 01:24:15,041
That police vehicle's been following us
for a while. Why aren't they going ahead?

1135
01:24:15,625 --> 01:24:16,500
Anyway, let them be.

1136
01:24:28,458 --> 01:24:30,791
You know, sir,
I had acted in a TV show recently.

1137
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:34,458
I think they recognized
me, that's why they waved.

1138
01:24:36,291 --> 01:24:38,333
-Do you teach in college?
-No.

1139
01:24:38,916 --> 01:24:41,125
You sound familiar.

1140
01:24:41,333 --> 01:24:42,375
What do you do?

1141
01:24:42,916 --> 01:24:43,875
A bit of politics.

1142
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:45,333
Oh! No wonder!

1143
01:24:46,375 --> 01:24:47,500
-Are you a member?
-Yes.

1144
01:24:47,875 --> 01:24:48,708
Which panchayat?

1145
01:24:49,333 --> 01:24:51,666
-Kollam, Kadakkal.
-Oh! That's where our CM is from!

1146
01:24:52,750 --> 01:24:54,125
That's awesome!

1147
01:24:59,250 --> 01:25:02,166
WELCOME TO THE HON CM OF KERALA,
MR. KADAKKAL CHANDRAN

1148
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,583
Sir, are you some kind of a troublemaker?
The police are here.

1149
01:25:16,666 --> 01:25:18,666
-What's your name?
-It's Binu.

1150
01:25:19,041 --> 01:25:20,791
-How much for the ride?
-No. It's okay, sir.

1151
01:25:21,666 --> 01:25:23,208
-No, sir--
-It's okay.

1152
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:27,958
And yes, we'll be repairing
the roads soon. Okay?

1153
01:25:28,041 --> 01:25:30,750
-No, sir. The roads are fine.
-Don't you want them fixed? Alright!

1154
01:25:35,250 --> 01:25:38,000
In every human being,
there is a sense of politics.

1155
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:42,375
You should also have a touch of politics
in your thoughts, actions, and attitude.

1156
01:25:42,791 --> 01:25:44,000
But remember one thing.

1157
01:25:44,291 --> 01:25:47,000
Your parents send you here to study.

1158
01:25:47,583 --> 01:25:50,041
So, your priority should be your studies.

1159
01:25:50,458 --> 01:25:54,750
That doesn't mean all of you
should be doctors or engineers…

1160
01:25:54,916 --> 01:25:56,500
or IT professionals.

1161
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,916
Education should not just be about
expanding your knowledge and intelligence.

1162
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,208
It should enable you to take
up any job with happiness.

1163
01:26:03,541 --> 01:26:07,166
It should also nourish your
physical capacities and health.

1164
01:26:07,250 --> 01:26:08,500
That is real education.

1165
01:26:09,291 --> 01:26:11,666
We need everyone, like, taxi drivers…

1166
01:26:11,958 --> 01:26:16,250
people doing ordinary jobs…
like tailors, businessmen,

1167
01:26:16,541 --> 01:26:17,625
and yes, politicians as well.

1168
01:26:17,708 --> 01:26:20,541
It is all of these that make
this society what it is.

1169
01:26:20,833 --> 01:26:22,541
That is what makes the country progress.

1170
01:26:22,833 --> 01:26:24,750
You must have heard of
the dignity of labor.

1171
01:26:25,041 --> 01:26:27,041
Every job has dignity…

1172
01:26:27,833 --> 01:26:30,000
and the person doing it
should also be dignified.

1173
01:26:30,083 --> 01:26:32,291
Sir… can you give me a haircut?

1174
01:26:33,291 --> 01:26:35,000
Who is it? Who said that?

1175
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:36,375
Who is it?

1176
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:38,875
Step forward!

1177
01:26:40,375 --> 01:26:41,666
Come on! I am asking you…

1178
01:26:42,125 --> 01:26:43,125
who was that?

1179
01:26:46,541 --> 01:26:47,916
I am extremely sorry, sir.

1180
01:26:49,708 --> 01:26:51,291
Whoever asked that, step forward.

1181
01:26:54,791 --> 01:26:57,375
Do you think I can't
find you if you don't?

1182
01:27:03,083 --> 01:27:05,458
Hey, step forward! Come on!

1183
01:27:09,875 --> 01:27:10,708
Come forward!

1184
01:27:12,291 --> 01:27:13,208
Come here!

1185
01:27:16,958 --> 01:27:17,875
What's your name?

1186
01:27:18,291 --> 01:27:19,250
-Jaimon.
-What?

1187
01:27:19,458 --> 01:27:20,458
Jaimon!

1188
01:27:20,583 --> 01:27:21,458
Okay.

1189
01:27:21,791 --> 01:27:24,875
I'll give you a haircut, Jaimon. Fix
a time and come over to the Cliff House.

1190
01:27:25,625 --> 01:27:28,291
Or I'll come to your house and do it.
I am okay either way.

1191
01:27:28,958 --> 01:27:30,750
Sir, I was just…

1192
01:27:30,833 --> 01:27:34,333
-I didn't mean it.
-But I really meant what I said.

1193
01:27:35,041 --> 01:27:37,958
You asked me that question
because my father was a barber.

1194
01:27:39,625 --> 01:27:43,000
Yes. My father was a barber.

1195
01:27:44,208 --> 01:27:47,833
It was with that job…
that he took care of our family.

1196
01:27:49,791 --> 01:27:53,458
My father did not teach me
any political ideology…

1197
01:27:54,083 --> 01:27:58,041
but he ensured that we had
three proper meals a day.

1198
01:27:58,666 --> 01:28:00,500
That's the politics he taught me.

1199
01:28:01,125 --> 01:28:02,833
And he also taught me to cut hair.

1200
01:28:03,208 --> 01:28:07,750
So, in all earnestness…
with confidence and dignity, I can say

1201
01:28:07,916 --> 01:28:09,875
that I can give excellent haircuts!

1202
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:19,666
And there was something else my
father demonstrated through his life.

1203
01:28:20,458 --> 01:28:22,791
That one can have a happy
life even in poverty.

1204
01:28:23,833 --> 01:28:27,875
Prosperity has no connection
with the word "money."

1205
01:28:29,416 --> 01:28:30,291
Come up.

1206
01:28:39,041 --> 01:28:40,041
Come closer.

1207
01:28:41,208 --> 01:28:42,625
What does your father do, Jaimon?

1208
01:28:43,041 --> 01:28:44,083
He runs a travel agency.

1209
01:28:45,666 --> 01:28:48,541
In those days, the "Bruce Lee Cut"
and "Step Cut" were in fashion.

1210
01:28:48,666 --> 01:28:49,958
My father didn't know all that.

1211
01:28:50,958 --> 01:28:53,500
He'd give normal haircuts,
but he'd do that really well.

1212
01:28:53,583 --> 01:28:57,000
He had his barbershop, but he would
also do it in people's houses.

1213
01:28:58,333 --> 01:29:00,125
You are overdue for a haircut, son.

1214
01:29:00,208 --> 01:29:02,875
Let's not delay it anymore.
Let's have that haircut soon, okay?

1215
01:29:07,583 --> 01:29:08,416
Go.

1216
01:29:10,291 --> 01:29:12,541
If I ever need to step
away from politics…

1217
01:29:13,625 --> 01:29:15,125
I have a vocation to fall back on.

1218
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,541
Without ever attending college…

1219
01:29:19,166 --> 01:29:21,666
without any educational qualification…

1220
01:29:21,958 --> 01:29:23,833
my father was able to teach me that skill.

1221
01:29:25,291 --> 01:29:28,333
So, I can always hold my
head high in this society.

1222
01:29:29,833 --> 01:29:31,250
I won't take more of your time.

1223
01:29:31,916 --> 01:29:34,833
I declare the college
anniversary celebrations…

1224
01:29:35,041 --> 01:29:37,916
formally open.

1225
01:30:05,041 --> 01:30:08,125
<i>Sir, this bill,</i>
<i>the Representation of the People…</i>

1226
01:30:08,291 --> 01:30:10,750
{\an8}<i>is proposed to bring back real</i>
<i>democracy to our country, sir.</i>

1227
01:30:10,833 --> 01:30:12,583
<i>Are you presenting this as a private bill?</i>

1228
01:30:12,666 --> 01:30:13,500
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1229
01:30:13,583 --> 01:30:16,041
<i>Sir, this will not work for our country.</i>

1230
01:30:16,583 --> 01:30:18,458
Don't these guys have
anything better to do?

1231
01:30:19,458 --> 01:30:20,416
You do your job, man!

1232
01:30:21,083 --> 01:30:22,791
<i>This is not easy at all.</i>

1233
01:30:23,583 --> 01:30:25,625
{\an8}<i>Sir, we should at least</i>
<i>take this up for discussion.</i>

1234
01:30:25,708 --> 01:30:27,708
<i>For now, this bill is not on our agenda.</i>

1235
01:30:27,791 --> 01:30:29,291
<i>It requires in-depth discussion.</i>

1236
01:30:30,083 --> 01:30:31,833
Just as I expected.

1237
01:30:34,125 --> 01:30:35,458
I had told you, sir.

1238
01:30:37,541 --> 01:30:39,750
Let's wait until the next
central cabinet meeting.

1239
01:30:42,291 --> 01:30:44,625
INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL
THIRUVANANTHAPURAM AIRPORT- T2

1240
01:30:47,708 --> 01:30:50,375
TERMINAL TWO

1241
01:30:56,125 --> 01:30:57,458
Welcome, sir. This way.

1242
01:31:05,583 --> 01:31:06,500
Chandran's here!

1243
01:31:09,375 --> 01:31:10,833
Hi, Uncle!

1244
01:31:13,958 --> 01:31:14,916
There's my little guy!

1245
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,041
Where are you off to?

1246
01:31:20,250 --> 01:31:21,750
-Check-in done?
-Yes.

1247
01:31:28,166 --> 01:31:30,541
Until now, at least, I had
the relief of having you around.

1248
01:31:33,791 --> 01:31:34,666
But now…

1249
01:31:36,250 --> 01:31:37,583
when will I get to see you again?

1250
01:31:43,583 --> 01:31:45,041
When are we going to meet again?

1251
01:31:47,166 --> 01:31:48,750
Call me as soon as you get there, okay?

1252
01:31:52,916 --> 01:31:53,791
Go.

1253
01:31:56,291 --> 01:31:57,666
We'll call you when we get there.

1254
01:31:59,791 --> 01:32:00,750
Come on.

1255
01:33:03,333 --> 01:33:05,333
Sir… it's that one.

1256
01:33:05,666 --> 01:33:06,583
That's your car.

1257
01:33:42,833 --> 01:33:43,875
Chandran!

1258
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,875
I never did anything for my
father when he was alive.

1259
01:33:52,125 --> 01:33:53,916
I didn't do anything for my mother either.

1260
01:33:55,250 --> 01:33:56,625
Now that they are gone,

1261
01:33:56,833 --> 01:33:59,791
what's the point in my praying for
them or doing rituals for them!

1262
01:34:01,166 --> 01:34:03,166
It won't make up for what
I failed to do for them.

1263
01:34:09,375 --> 01:34:11,166
They even raised Lathika so well.

1264
01:34:11,791 --> 01:34:13,791
They must have expected
that after they are gone,

1265
01:34:13,916 --> 01:34:15,083
I would take care of her.

1266
01:34:16,833 --> 01:34:20,000
But I never found the time
to look after her needs…

1267
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:21,666
or even spend time with her.

1268
01:34:23,250 --> 01:34:24,833
Those are my failures, right, brother?

1269
01:34:25,083 --> 01:34:26,000
Well…

1270
01:34:26,416 --> 01:34:30,375
when you are in a position with so
much responsibility, all that is natural.

1271
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,791
But the time you should
have spent with Lathika…

1272
01:34:34,250 --> 01:34:37,291
you spent on doing good for others.

1273
01:34:37,916 --> 01:34:41,083
The blessings and grace of all
those deeds will come to Lathika.

1274
01:34:49,125 --> 01:34:50,958
Prema! There is no more space here!

1275
01:34:51,041 --> 01:34:53,250
-Direct the next set of cars to B3, okay?
-Okay, sister.

1276
01:34:57,916 --> 01:35:00,333
-Hey, stop!
-Stop!

1277
01:35:00,583 --> 01:35:01,708
-Stop!
-Hey!

1278
01:35:08,666 --> 01:35:11,208
Sir, please don't park there!
It is reserved!

1279
01:35:11,375 --> 01:35:12,250
Sir!

1280
01:35:12,541 --> 01:35:13,458
Sir!

1281
01:35:13,541 --> 01:35:14,416
Oh, no!

1282
01:35:20,291 --> 01:35:22,083
What on earth were you looking at?

1283
01:35:22,291 --> 01:35:24,250
Didn't I tell you that was reserved?

1284
01:35:24,333 --> 01:35:27,541
-You were on the phone.
-Don't act too smart, okay?

1285
01:35:27,625 --> 01:35:30,125
What am I supposed to do
for your carelessness?

1286
01:35:32,750 --> 01:35:35,666
It will take six months of your
salary to get this light fixed.

1287
01:35:36,333 --> 01:35:39,250
-Do you know what make of car this is?
-I know what make of car this is…

1288
01:35:39,541 --> 01:35:40,583
but I don't know who you are.

1289
01:35:45,875 --> 01:35:48,500
Seena Dasappan!
Do you want my address as well?

1290
01:36:04,625 --> 01:36:07,750
I don't know about
the Bruce Lee Cut and all that.

1291
01:36:08,208 --> 01:36:10,833
Firstly,
your hair is as curly as a spring.

1292
01:36:11,125 --> 01:36:13,708
And you never take my advice to oil it!

1293
01:36:18,958 --> 01:36:19,833
Hello, Dad?

1294
01:36:24,625 --> 01:36:25,583
Okay, Dad!

1295
01:36:39,666 --> 01:36:40,875
-Alright, sir.
-Okay.

1296
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,250
What is it? What do you want?

1297
01:36:44,666 --> 01:36:45,791
-My dad.
-Your dad?

1298
01:36:47,041 --> 01:36:47,916
Dad.

1299
01:36:52,166 --> 01:36:53,291
Dad?

1300
01:36:54,458 --> 01:36:55,500
Dad!

1301
01:36:56,333 --> 01:36:57,291
What's going on?

1302
01:36:58,416 --> 01:36:59,541
Come here, girl!

1303
01:37:06,083 --> 01:37:06,916
Come.

1304
01:37:12,916 --> 01:37:15,916
It must be somewhere else, sir.
I didn't find anything on her body.

1305
01:37:17,250 --> 01:37:19,083
You better say where it
is or you will suffer!

1306
01:37:19,458 --> 01:37:20,333
Did you hear me?

1307
01:37:26,833 --> 01:37:27,750
What is this?

1308
01:37:28,250 --> 01:37:29,208
It's a false case!

1309
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:31,750
They're saying I stole
gold out of someone's car.

1310
01:37:32,625 --> 01:37:35,208
I had a small argument with
someone in the parking lot today.

1311
01:37:35,291 --> 01:37:36,583
This is a consequence of that.

1312
01:37:37,958 --> 01:37:39,416
They won't believe whatever I say!

1313
01:37:46,291 --> 01:37:47,250
Sir, this is her.

1314
01:37:48,250 --> 01:37:50,291
Do you know whom you're talking to?

1315
01:37:51,250 --> 01:37:52,625
What does it matter to me who you are?

1316
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,375
She won't admit to the crime, sir.

1317
01:38:08,416 --> 01:38:10,916
-Now talk to me.
-I haven't stolen anything, sir.

1318
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,791
What was that? I didn't hear you.

1319
01:38:13,166 --> 01:38:15,666
Sir… she hasn't stolen anything.

1320
01:38:16,708 --> 01:38:19,791
A family interested in a marriage
alliance is coming to see her next week.

1321
01:38:20,166 --> 01:38:22,375
-Please!
-Was I talking to you? Step aside!

1322
01:38:28,541 --> 01:38:30,208
One day in jail will take care…

1323
01:38:30,625 --> 01:38:31,541
of her arrogance.

1324
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:37,375
Come here!

1325
01:38:46,958 --> 01:38:48,375
If I have to spend the night here,

1326
01:38:49,291 --> 01:38:50,916
don't come back in the morning for me.

1327
01:39:05,166 --> 01:39:08,041
-Dad, what are we going to do?
-I have no clue.

1328
01:39:15,375 --> 01:39:17,666
I have Advocate Padmanabhan's number.
Shall I call him?

1329
01:39:17,750 --> 01:39:18,666
Yes, call him!

1330
01:39:29,291 --> 01:39:32,750
<i>The dialed number does not exist.</i>
<i>Please check the number and dial again.</i>

1331
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:39,916
Come.

1332
01:39:48,333 --> 01:39:49,208
Move!

1333
01:40:30,916 --> 01:40:33,208
Hello? Sir, it's Sanal!

1334
01:40:33,583 --> 01:40:36,708
Sir, my sister has been
implicated in a false case…

1335
01:40:37,166 --> 01:40:40,333
at the Museum Police Station! Hello?

1336
01:40:42,208 --> 01:40:43,291
Hello, sir?

1337
01:41:18,083 --> 01:41:19,041
Sir, it's the CM.

1338
01:41:46,666 --> 01:41:48,333
-Get me the General Diary.
-Sir.

1339
01:42:09,125 --> 01:42:10,583
-What's your sister's name?
-Seena.

1340
01:42:11,416 --> 01:42:13,291
-Where is she?
-I'll get her, sir.

1341
01:42:14,833 --> 01:42:15,750
-Bring her.
-Sir.

1342
01:42:33,833 --> 01:42:34,916
What's this case about?

1343
01:42:36,208 --> 01:42:38,125
What is the nature of the
case against this girl?

1344
01:42:38,208 --> 01:42:40,166
Sir, it's a case of theft.

1345
01:42:40,291 --> 01:42:41,333
What theft?

1346
01:42:41,791 --> 01:42:47,750
Sir… she stole some gold out of
a car in the parking lot where she works.

1347
01:42:48,458 --> 01:42:49,458
Who is the complainant?

1348
01:42:50,125 --> 01:42:53,500
Sir, it's a man named Susheel.
He is a businessman.

1349
01:42:54,125 --> 01:42:55,041
Show me the complaint.

1350
01:42:55,666 --> 01:42:58,166
-He hasn't given a written complaint, sir.
-Then?

1351
01:42:59,916 --> 01:43:01,708
Sir, he gave the complaint over the phone.

1352
01:43:02,625 --> 01:43:03,666
Have you filed an FIR?

1353
01:43:05,125 --> 01:43:06,083
No, sir.

1354
01:43:06,583 --> 01:43:08,833
Did you investigate at
the site of the incident?

1355
01:43:10,333 --> 01:43:12,250
-No.
-Have you questioned her?

1356
01:43:13,583 --> 01:43:14,875
-Yes.
-And?

1357
01:43:15,791 --> 01:43:17,000
She did not admit to it, sir.

1358
01:43:17,958 --> 01:43:19,250
Did you find the missing gold?

1359
01:43:23,166 --> 01:43:24,625
When did this incident take place?

1360
01:43:25,125 --> 01:43:26,958
Sir, this evening.

1361
01:43:28,166 --> 01:43:30,041
So, you are charging her with Section 379.

1362
01:43:30,291 --> 01:43:31,125
Yes, sir.

1363
01:43:31,541 --> 01:43:33,750
A theft that is alleged to have
happened this evening.

1364
01:43:34,666 --> 01:43:37,916
There is no written complaint,
you have not visited the site…

1365
01:43:38,166 --> 01:43:40,791
there is no FIR and no
stolen gold was recovered…

1366
01:43:41,333 --> 01:43:43,708
but the girl whom you're saying
is the suspect is in jail.

1367
01:43:48,125 --> 01:43:49,041
Mr. Commissioner…

1368
01:43:49,458 --> 01:43:52,125
do you have any idea what is
going on in the stations under you?

1369
01:43:53,833 --> 01:43:56,958
Don't you have a copy of the order
that says women should not be called

1370
01:43:57,500 --> 01:44:01,583
to the station after 5:00 p.m. and you
can question them at home if necessary?

1371
01:44:02,875 --> 01:44:03,708
Don't you?

1372
01:44:05,500 --> 01:44:06,416
We do, sir.

1373
01:44:06,958 --> 01:44:09,833
Didn't you realize that such
orders are meant to be executed?

1374
01:44:13,541 --> 01:44:16,708
Now, tell me the truth.
Is this a genuine case or not?

1375
01:44:23,458 --> 01:44:25,375
R. Bahuleyan, the Sub-Inspector of Police.

1376
01:44:29,375 --> 01:44:31,291
Shine Thomas, the Circle Inspector.

1377
01:44:32,333 --> 01:44:34,666
-Get suspension orders ready for both.
-Yes, sir.

1378
01:44:35,750 --> 01:44:37,875
Drop them off at home in
your official car, right now!

1379
01:44:37,958 --> 01:44:39,750
-Yes, sir.
-And call me when they get home.

1380
01:44:39,833 --> 01:44:40,666
Yes, sir!

1381
01:44:40,750 --> 01:44:43,375
Also, I want full details
of the supposed complainant

1382
01:44:43,458 --> 01:44:45,958
on my desk by 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.

1383
01:44:46,166 --> 01:44:47,166
I will see to it, sir.

1384
01:45:07,666 --> 01:45:08,958
-What are you doing here?
-Sir--

1385
01:45:15,208 --> 01:45:16,083
What is it?

1386
01:45:18,416 --> 01:45:19,250
-I--
-Come!

1387
01:45:25,166 --> 01:45:26,541
-Tell me.
-Yesterday…

1388
01:45:27,125 --> 01:45:30,958
had you not come there, I don't think
we would have been alive right now.

1389
01:45:31,041 --> 01:45:32,791
I don't know how to thank you for that.

1390
01:45:33,125 --> 01:45:34,708
There is no need to thank me.

1391
01:45:35,291 --> 01:45:38,708
I didn't do anything great.
I just did my job, okay?

1392
01:45:38,791 --> 01:45:41,291
I don't know about all that.
You came when I called.

1393
01:45:42,166 --> 01:45:43,916
I don't know how to return that favor.

1394
01:45:44,625 --> 01:45:47,541
And even if there is something I could
do, I don't know if you'd want it.

1395
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:49,208
No such thing is needed, okay?

1396
01:46:19,875 --> 01:46:23,291
<i>Come, ruler of people's hearts</i>

1397
01:46:23,708 --> 01:46:26,958
<i>Bring us a new era, a new dawn</i>

1398
01:46:27,041 --> 01:46:30,250
<i>The populace awaits</i>

1399
01:46:30,333 --> 01:46:34,041
<i>Through you, this land acquires grace</i>

1400
01:46:35,041 --> 01:46:38,791
<i>Come, ruler of people's hearts</i>

1401
01:46:38,875 --> 01:46:42,083
<i>Bring us a new era, a new dawn</i>

1402
01:46:42,166 --> 01:46:45,291
<i>The populace awaits</i>

1403
01:46:45,416 --> 01:46:49,208
<i>Through you, this land acquires grace</i>

1404
01:46:50,166 --> 01:46:57,208
<i>Make way</i>
<i>The wheels of justice roll this way</i>

1405
01:46:57,666 --> 01:47:01,291
<i>Come, ruler of people's hearts</i>

1406
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:04,750
<i>Bring us a new era, a new dawn</i>

1407
01:47:04,833 --> 01:47:07,916
<i>The populace awaits</i>

1408
01:47:08,083 --> 01:47:13,583
<i>Through you, this land acquires grace</i>

1409
01:47:27,958 --> 01:47:31,208
<i>We will have better lives</i>

1410
01:47:31,291 --> 01:47:34,583
<i>We will have a brighter tomorrow</i>

1411
01:47:35,416 --> 01:47:38,791
<i>We will look through the chaff</i>
<i>The blooms, the grains</i>

1412
01:47:38,875 --> 01:47:42,166
<i>And find the leader</i>
<i>Of the land with us</i>

1413
01:47:42,833 --> 01:47:46,791
<i>The dirt will be cleaned</i>
<i>And the paths will be clear</i>

1414
01:47:46,875 --> 01:47:50,791
<i>As the friend of the land walks with us</i>

1415
01:47:50,875 --> 01:47:53,291
<i>A new era is dawning here</i>

1416
01:47:53,541 --> 01:47:57,125
<i>The darkness fades away</i>

1417
01:47:57,208 --> 01:48:01,000
<i>There is new meaning blooming here</i>

1418
01:48:01,083 --> 01:48:04,166
<i>Let's prepare ourselves</i>

1419
01:48:04,875 --> 01:48:10,833
<i>Let us awaken</i>

1420
01:48:12,791 --> 01:48:16,250
<i>Let us rise above</i>

1421
01:48:16,416 --> 01:48:18,958
<i>Let us follow each other</i>

1422
01:48:19,041 --> 01:48:21,833
Every month, you'll receive
your pension at home, okay?

1423
01:48:21,916 --> 01:48:24,208
Thank you. We did the rounds
of many offices for this.

1424
01:48:25,083 --> 01:48:26,250
That's what I am here for.

1425
01:48:28,375 --> 01:48:32,125
<i>Come, ruler of people's hearts</i>

1426
01:48:32,208 --> 01:48:35,583
<i>Bring us a new era, a new dawn</i>

1427
01:48:35,666 --> 01:48:38,583
<i>The populace awaits</i>

1428
01:48:38,875 --> 01:48:42,958
<i>Through you, this land acquires grace</i>

1429
01:48:43,541 --> 01:48:47,250
<i>Come, ruler of people's hearts</i>

1430
01:48:47,333 --> 01:48:50,583
<i>Bring us a new era, a new dawn</i>

1431
01:48:50,666 --> 01:48:53,750
<i>The populace awaits</i>

1432
01:48:53,916 --> 01:48:57,958
<i>Through you, this land acquires grace</i>

1433
01:48:58,458 --> 01:49:04,458
<i>Make way</i>
<i>The wheels of justice roll this way</i>

1434
01:49:05,708 --> 01:49:09,041
<i>Let us follow each other</i>

1435
01:49:09,291 --> 01:49:13,041
<i>Let this be the will of the people</i>

1436
01:49:13,125 --> 01:49:16,666
<i>Step by step</i>

1437
01:49:16,875 --> 01:49:20,583
<i>Come together, my people!</i>

1438
01:49:20,666 --> 01:49:23,958
<i>A new law</i>

1439
01:49:24,416 --> 01:49:28,125
<i>Is the will of the people</i>

1440
01:49:28,208 --> 01:49:31,958
<i>Step by step</i>

1441
01:49:41,208 --> 01:49:42,083
Sir.

1442
01:49:53,125 --> 01:49:54,458
Could you connect me to the CM's office?

1443
01:49:54,541 --> 01:49:57,333
{\an8}<i>The public and the political parties</i>

1444
01:49:57,416 --> 01:50:02,000
{\an8}<i>got to know that Kadakkal Chandran,</i>
<i>the Chief Minister of Kerala…</i>

1445
01:50:02,083 --> 01:50:05,333
{\an8}<i>was the main force behind this bill.</i>

1446
01:50:08,416 --> 01:50:10,125
When are you presenting
this in the assembly?

1447
01:50:10,208 --> 01:50:11,250
Will it become a law?

1448
01:50:11,333 --> 01:50:14,375
Do you think this can put an end
to the corruption in the state?

1449
01:50:14,458 --> 01:50:15,916
Will this bill bring
revolutionary changes here?

1450
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,166
Do you think our politicians
will support this move?

1451
01:50:18,250 --> 01:50:22,083
In Kerala's current circumstances,
is a bill like this relevant, CM?

1452
01:50:22,916 --> 01:50:24,458
I will tell you everything, just wait!

1453
01:50:30,125 --> 01:50:31,125
Hello, sir.

1454
01:50:31,750 --> 01:50:34,083
Everyone is a bit agitated.

1455
01:50:35,666 --> 01:50:39,333
And it has somehow leaked out
that you were behind this bill.

1456
01:50:40,625 --> 01:50:41,750
Don't you know?

1457
01:50:42,666 --> 01:50:47,208
A secret should be at the most known…
to two people.

1458
01:50:48,791 --> 01:50:49,958
And that day…

1459
01:50:51,375 --> 01:50:53,166
there were three of us, right?

1460
01:51:19,375 --> 01:51:20,416
Isn't Baby here yet?

1461
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:30,083
The reason I called
this emergency meeting--

1462
01:51:30,166 --> 01:51:31,625
You don't have to say anything, CM!

1463
01:51:33,875 --> 01:51:36,083
Today, we will do the talking.

1464
01:51:36,333 --> 01:51:37,375
You just have to listen!

1465
01:51:37,791 --> 01:51:40,250
We are the ruling coalition
in this state today.

1466
01:51:40,333 --> 01:51:41,625
If we, and I mean…

1467
01:51:42,291 --> 01:51:45,708
you put forward a bill in
the assembly, it has to pass!

1468
01:51:46,458 --> 01:51:51,000
If not, we will be
facing another election!

1469
01:51:51,416 --> 01:51:53,958
Hey! What you are talking about, sir?

1470
01:51:54,500 --> 01:51:56,458
It's the CM who is going
to present the bill.

1471
01:51:56,541 --> 01:51:57,833
Then, why wouldn't it pass?

1472
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
Why are you so against this bill anyway?

1473
01:52:01,166 --> 01:52:03,375
Let it be presented in the House
first, then we'll see.

1474
01:52:03,750 --> 01:52:06,875
If the CM is so confident,
let him present the bill, Mr. Musaliyar.

1475
01:52:07,083 --> 01:52:09,083
-It will be--
-What are you talking about, Geetha?

1476
01:52:09,750 --> 01:52:12,083
If we stand by this nonsense,
we will be the ones to suffer!

1477
01:52:12,166 --> 01:52:13,125
Yes.

1478
01:52:33,916 --> 01:52:36,291
CM, just because you
are in that position…

1479
01:52:36,375 --> 01:52:38,375
don't assume you can
do anything as you wish.

1480
01:52:38,541 --> 01:52:41,041
Most of us sitting here, including me…

1481
01:52:41,208 --> 01:52:42,750
are against this bill!

1482
01:52:43,125 --> 01:52:45,541
I don't know if this is
the right comparison,

1483
01:52:45,833 --> 01:52:48,958
but they say there is a code
of honor even among thieves.

1484
01:52:49,583 --> 01:52:53,708
But the CM paid no heed to any such thing
before going forward with this bill.

1485
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:57,250
Mr. Ramachandran,
this bill was passed in Parliament.

1486
01:52:57,333 --> 01:52:59,416
Why are you blaming the CM for that?

1487
01:52:59,500 --> 01:53:00,583
I agree with you, Geetha.

1488
01:53:00,666 --> 01:53:03,166
The bill reached Parliament
through our sole MP there,

1489
01:53:03,250 --> 01:53:05,000
but did you know about it? Did you?

1490
01:53:05,833 --> 01:53:07,833
Was even a party executive convened?

1491
01:53:07,958 --> 01:53:10,500
No! And even if you ignore all
that, this man sitting here

1492
01:53:10,583 --> 01:53:13,041
is the chairman of the party…
and even he did not know!

1493
01:53:16,625 --> 01:53:18,791
CM, this bill should not be
presented in the assembly.

1494
01:53:20,708 --> 01:53:21,833
Mr. Rajan…

1495
01:53:23,166 --> 01:53:24,166
are you a thief?

1496
01:53:26,958 --> 01:53:28,958
Mr. Ramachandran, are you a thief?

1497
01:53:31,750 --> 01:53:32,708
How about you?

1498
01:53:37,208 --> 01:53:39,125
If all of you are so clean…

1499
01:53:39,750 --> 01:53:41,250
then why do you fear this bill?

1500
01:53:45,416 --> 01:53:46,625
Serve the people well…

1501
01:53:48,166 --> 01:53:50,958
and they will give you not
just five but 50 years.

1502
01:53:52,416 --> 01:53:55,875
They will trust you, love
you, and stand by you.

1503
01:53:56,250 --> 01:53:58,666
That is what history shows
us, not just here…

1504
01:53:59,125 --> 01:54:01,958
but in every democratic country
in every part of the world.

1505
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:04,750
I will present this bill in the assembly.

1506
01:54:05,125 --> 01:54:06,208
That is my duty.

1507
01:54:06,750 --> 01:54:10,416
As the Chief Minister, it is my
responsibility towards the people.

1508
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:31,000
Mr. Baby!

1509
01:54:31,958 --> 01:54:34,875
Whether the bill is passed or rejected,
it makes no difference to us.

1510
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
But if you go forward with this,

1511
01:54:38,250 --> 01:54:39,833
-we don't want him anymore!
-Yes.

1512
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:43,875
That's right.
We have other equally qualified people.

1513
01:54:43,958 --> 01:54:46,125
Look here, Musaliyar!
Forget those aspirations, okay?

1514
01:54:46,208 --> 01:54:47,875
-Don't threaten us, Vishwambharan!
-Oh!

1515
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:51,166
A few people like you cannot manage
to keep him in that position!

1516
01:54:51,250 --> 01:54:53,125
-Right!
-Electing the Chief Minister…

1517
01:54:53,208 --> 01:54:55,333
is also done by a democratic
process, got it?

1518
01:54:55,416 --> 01:54:58,958
Baby… it is a feeling shared by
the majority of people sitting here.

1519
01:54:59,041 --> 01:55:01,958
It's just that only Kuriakose expressed
it. And when it comes to the CM--

1520
01:55:03,041 --> 01:55:06,000
Whatever the party decides,
I will abide by that.

1521
01:55:06,708 --> 01:55:07,833
It will not change.

1522
01:55:12,750 --> 01:55:13,625
Sir.

1523
01:55:17,250 --> 01:55:18,875
Others are also qualified.

1524
01:55:21,125 --> 01:55:23,250
You can be the CM
and I will have the Home Ministry.

1525
01:55:24,625 --> 01:55:26,375
We will be in power
for only two years more.

1526
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:28,208
After one year…

1527
01:55:28,875 --> 01:55:32,208
you get the Home Ministry
and I will be the CM. What do you think?

1528
01:55:54,541 --> 01:55:56,208
It was on the same day that both of us…

1529
01:55:57,500 --> 01:55:58,916
together got our party membership.

1530
01:55:59,625 --> 01:56:01,041
It has been 31 years.

1531
01:56:03,250 --> 01:56:04,416
In the equation we share…

1532
01:56:05,291 --> 01:56:07,291
mutual trust was the greatest factor.

1533
01:56:07,791 --> 01:56:09,250
And it was you who taught me that.

1534
01:56:11,041 --> 01:56:12,416
Do you remember that?

1535
01:56:15,625 --> 01:56:17,416
This party means everything to me.

1536
01:56:19,666 --> 01:56:22,250
That is the reason I am
continuing in this position.

1537
01:56:24,916 --> 01:56:26,875
Or else, right there
in that meeting room…

1538
01:56:27,333 --> 01:56:29,000
I would have handed you my resignation.

1539
01:56:29,958 --> 01:56:31,416
The reason I didn't do that…

1540
01:56:32,208 --> 01:56:34,208
was because it would lower
the esteem of my party.

1541
01:56:36,125 --> 01:56:38,708
I know the bill you want
to present is important.

1542
01:56:38,875 --> 01:56:40,541
I know its greatness.

1543
01:56:41,791 --> 01:56:43,583
But you cannot bring
it before the assembly.

1544
01:56:46,291 --> 01:56:48,583
I don't like it when you
belittle yourself before others.

1545
01:56:52,333 --> 01:56:55,333
Beyond our political views and ideologies,

1546
01:56:56,083 --> 01:56:57,416
we shared a bond.

1547
01:56:58,500 --> 01:57:00,041
At least, that's what I thought.

1548
01:57:01,333 --> 01:57:03,041
But now I understand how much…

1549
01:57:04,041 --> 01:57:06,083
you truly understand me and trust me.

1550
01:57:09,458 --> 01:57:10,708
It's very heartening to know.

1551
01:57:15,708 --> 01:57:16,666
Baby!

1552
01:57:24,666 --> 01:57:26,333
Had I told you about this…

1553
01:57:26,750 --> 01:57:28,250
would you have supported me?

1554
01:57:28,791 --> 01:57:30,000
Tell me truthfully.

1555
01:57:32,291 --> 01:57:34,208
Had I not been
the chairman of the party…

1556
01:57:34,750 --> 01:57:37,166
I would have been at the
forefront to support you on this.

1557
01:57:37,500 --> 01:57:38,500
In every situation.

1558
01:58:11,083 --> 01:58:13,750
Hey! Mr. Sugunan! What a fantastic house!

1559
01:58:13,958 --> 01:58:17,375
The locals think my brother-in-law who
works in the gulf built this for me.

1560
01:58:17,708 --> 01:58:19,625
But this actually belongs
to Mr. Jayanandan.

1561
01:58:19,708 --> 01:58:20,666
Not me.

1562
01:58:24,666 --> 01:58:28,291
The CM seems hell-bent on presenting
this bill, as you may already know.

1563
01:58:28,375 --> 01:58:30,250
But it has no chance
of being passed by the assembly.

1564
01:58:30,333 --> 01:58:32,750
I was just coming to that.
If the government…

1565
01:58:32,833 --> 01:58:36,208
especially, the Chief Minister directly
presents a bill in the assembly…

1566
01:58:36,541 --> 01:58:37,583
it has to pass.

1567
01:58:38,375 --> 01:58:41,500
Or else, it destroys the
credibility of the government.

1568
01:58:43,541 --> 01:58:46,916
In normal circumstances…
that does not happen.

1569
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:48,416
What are you trying to say, Sugunan?

1570
01:58:48,500 --> 01:58:49,625
A motion of no confidence…

1571
01:58:51,916 --> 01:58:53,583
against the CM and the government.

1572
01:58:54,166 --> 01:58:57,666
This no-confidence motion…
will be moved by us.

1573
01:59:00,916 --> 01:59:02,208
If the bill is not passed…

1574
01:59:03,125 --> 01:59:05,708
the next day, I will meet
the speaker and give notice.

1575
01:59:06,958 --> 01:59:09,125
If the no-confidence
motion comes up after that,

1576
01:59:10,083 --> 01:59:13,791
Kadakkal Chandran will be left with
no ideas to stop it or oppose it.

1577
01:59:15,333 --> 01:59:16,791
The day the bill is presented…

1578
01:59:17,375 --> 01:59:18,875
we will suffocate him with questions.

1579
01:59:19,958 --> 01:59:22,208
He feels that he is above all.

1580
01:59:23,375 --> 01:59:25,083
We'd put an end to it that day.

1581
01:59:26,875 --> 01:59:28,291
I am trusting you…

1582
01:59:28,875 --> 01:59:32,458
and depending on your support
to go forward with this.

1583
01:59:34,708 --> 01:59:35,583
Dinesh!

1584
01:59:46,875 --> 01:59:50,166
I am making an offer to Dinesh
who called me and informed me…

1585
01:59:50,583 --> 01:59:51,958
that the CM was behind this bill.

1586
01:59:53,166 --> 01:59:54,916
Don't you think, Dinesh,

1587
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,791
that the post of minister in your
own state is above that of an MP?

1588
01:59:59,291 --> 02:00:00,166
Come.

1589
02:00:00,666 --> 02:00:03,083
When I presented this
bill in Parliament…

1590
02:00:03,458 --> 02:00:05,375
I thought it would end right there.

1591
02:00:06,583 --> 02:00:09,291
But the CM had made some
calculations about this.

1592
02:00:10,125 --> 02:00:12,125
He knew that before
the Lok Sabha Election,

1593
02:00:12,583 --> 02:00:15,208
the Central Government would use
this chance to boost their image.

1594
02:00:16,375 --> 02:00:17,791
And that's exactly what happened.

1595
02:00:18,166 --> 02:00:20,791
He has a special knack…

1596
02:00:20,875 --> 02:00:23,666
to foresee certain things.
We have to admit that.

1597
02:00:24,166 --> 02:00:25,500
There will be fresh elections…

1598
02:00:25,583 --> 02:00:28,083
and if we win,
Kuriakose gets the Home Ministry.

1599
02:00:28,875 --> 02:00:30,958
You've been eyeing that
for a while, haven't you?

1600
02:00:31,458 --> 02:00:33,583
-Rajan can have the revenue portfolio.
-Alright.

1601
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:37,791
And Dinesh, you get any other
portfolio you like except these!

1602
02:00:39,625 --> 02:00:40,666
Who will be the CM then?

1603
02:00:41,333 --> 02:00:42,250
Mr. Jayanandan.

1604
02:00:46,125 --> 02:00:47,791
There is no big ethical issue here.

1605
02:00:48,125 --> 02:00:50,583
Politics is no longer
about serving the country.

1606
02:00:51,041 --> 02:00:53,375
This is an industry and
when we are in business,

1607
02:00:53,458 --> 02:00:55,833
I need some profit and so do you, right?

1608
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:57,416
-Am I right or not?
-Of course!

1609
02:00:58,666 --> 02:01:00,875
So, we will be right there with
you, Mr. Jayanandan.

1610
02:01:00,958 --> 02:01:01,958
I am obliged to you.

1611
02:01:02,125 --> 02:01:03,833
-That's all I need.
-May we take your leave then?

1612
02:01:03,916 --> 02:01:05,375
Of course.

1613
02:01:08,875 --> 02:01:09,833
Thank you, sir.

1614
02:01:14,416 --> 02:01:15,416
Jayanandan…

1615
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:17,833
if the CM presents this bill,

1616
02:01:18,083 --> 02:01:20,875
there will be a few on our
side, who will support it.

1617
02:01:21,125 --> 02:01:22,166
Don't forget that.

1618
02:01:22,833 --> 02:01:25,833
And we know what Kuriakose is like.

1619
02:01:26,458 --> 02:01:29,625
There's a possibility that he will
change his mind at the last minute.

1620
02:01:32,583 --> 02:01:34,875
If you have no power,
you have no value in politics, sir.

1621
02:01:36,125 --> 02:01:37,916
When big opportunities knock at our door,

1622
02:01:38,750 --> 02:01:41,166
we need to keep some of
these scoundrels close.

1623
02:01:42,958 --> 02:01:48,916
{\an8}GOVERNMENT HOUSE, KERALA

1624
02:01:51,875 --> 02:01:55,333
So, you propose
to present the bill on 24th!

1625
02:01:55,458 --> 02:01:56,416
Yes, Your Excellency!

1626
02:01:58,500 --> 02:02:01,958
But, why in the old assembly hall?

1627
02:02:03,750 --> 02:02:07,708
It was there… that I stepped
in for the first time as an MLA.

1628
02:02:08,250 --> 02:02:12,000
It was there that so many
historical bills were presented.

1629
02:02:12,166 --> 02:02:13,875
-That is my sentiment.
-Oh!

1630
02:02:14,125 --> 02:02:15,000
Nice!

1631
02:02:16,083 --> 02:02:17,916
-I appreciate your effort.
-Thank you!

1632
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:19,166
And your good intentions.

1633
02:02:20,208 --> 02:02:22,875
But… you know, there are

1634
02:02:22,958 --> 02:02:26,416
-so many ifs and buts in this--
-Yes, Your Excellency.

1635
02:02:26,875 --> 02:02:29,125
I am aware of it, but still…

1636
02:02:29,625 --> 02:02:30,791
I want to try it once.

1637
02:02:31,041 --> 02:02:31,916
Okay.

1638
02:02:35,125 --> 02:02:37,125
All the best! Wish you all the best!

1639
02:02:37,208 --> 02:02:38,458
Thank you, Your Excellency!

1640
02:02:42,333 --> 02:02:46,375
<i>Despite the objections from his own</i>
<i>party members as well as the opposition,</i>

1641
02:02:46,458 --> 02:02:49,666
<i>Chief Minister Kadakkal Chandran is all</i>
<i>set to present this bill in the assembly.</i>

1642
02:02:49,750 --> 02:02:53,791
{\an8}<i>In the meantime, there is wide-ranging</i>
<i>support for the bill among the public.</i>

1643
02:02:53,875 --> 02:02:57,250
Democracy is about the public
being able to decide.

1644
02:02:57,333 --> 02:03:00,208
So, if we feel we made a mistake, it's
good to have the option to correct it.

1645
02:03:00,291 --> 02:03:01,916
We have some ministers who are thieves.

1646
02:03:02,291 --> 02:03:05,250
If this law helps to get rid of them,
then it'd be a very good thing.

1647
02:03:05,333 --> 02:03:07,458
We should try them out for two years
and if they're not doing their job,

1648
02:03:07,541 --> 02:03:09,000
they should be thrown out!

1649
02:03:09,083 --> 02:03:11,666
Whether it works in
reality remains to be seen.

1650
02:03:11,750 --> 02:03:14,000
No point talking about
something we don't know.

1651
02:03:14,083 --> 02:03:16,416
-This is not going to happen.
-We make a decision,

1652
02:03:16,500 --> 02:03:21,083
and when we realize it's wrong,
we need an option to correct it.

1653
02:03:21,166 --> 02:03:24,625
We express our opinion and it's
good to have the power to change it.

1654
02:03:24,708 --> 02:03:26,083
This won't happen.

1655
02:03:26,166 --> 02:03:27,750
If it happens, it's a good thing.

1656
02:03:27,833 --> 02:03:29,375
If it becomes a law, it would be great!

1657
02:03:29,458 --> 02:03:31,958
Whoever comes or goes,
our lives will continue to be the same.

1658
02:03:32,041 --> 02:03:33,583
A lot of corrupt people…

1659
02:03:33,666 --> 02:03:36,000
will be forced to give up
their ministerial positions.

1660
02:03:36,083 --> 02:03:38,333
Only then will people
like us get any benefit.

1661
02:03:38,416 --> 02:03:40,541
We feel the bill should be passed.

1662
02:03:40,625 --> 02:03:42,500
It's not as practical as it sounds.

1663
02:03:42,583 --> 02:03:45,166
We have to look at the positive
and negative sides of the bill…

1664
02:03:45,333 --> 02:03:47,208
before passing it.

1665
02:03:47,416 --> 02:03:49,125
Whoever can put this into
practice, I am with them.

1666
02:03:49,208 --> 02:03:50,333
I support this.

1667
02:03:50,416 --> 02:03:52,500
There will be no more corruption.
This bill will surely pass.

1668
02:03:52,583 --> 02:03:54,166
It should definitely pass!

1669
02:04:25,625 --> 02:04:26,458
Hello?

1670
02:04:27,041 --> 02:04:28,000
Have you left?

1671
02:04:29,500 --> 02:04:30,666
No, I'm just about to leave.

1672
02:04:31,125 --> 02:04:32,500
It's a cloudy day.

1673
02:04:33,333 --> 02:04:34,208
<i>It may rain.</i>

1674
02:04:35,250 --> 02:04:36,375
I'll be right here.

1675
02:04:38,875 --> 02:04:39,750
I'll see you later.

1676
02:04:58,250 --> 02:04:59,083
Brother Ibrahim…

1677
02:05:00,958 --> 02:05:02,708
let's eat together today. Come.

1678
02:05:14,666 --> 02:05:15,708
Come on, have it.

1679
02:05:44,291 --> 02:05:45,916
-Good morning.
-Good morning, sir!

1680
02:05:51,958 --> 02:05:52,875
Muneer!

1681
02:05:53,333 --> 02:05:54,458
-Sir?
-Let's go.

1682
02:06:26,750 --> 02:06:28,541
-Good luck to you, sir.
-Thank you.

1683
02:06:29,041 --> 02:06:31,291
Let this be a memorable day, sir…
for all of us.

1684
02:06:31,791 --> 02:06:32,666
Yeah.

1685
02:07:26,541 --> 02:07:29,708
Respected members of
the Legislative Assembly.

1686
02:07:30,916 --> 02:07:33,166
The Honorable Chairman of the Assembly.

1687
02:07:51,416 --> 02:07:53,000
The Right to Recall.

1688
02:07:53,291 --> 02:07:56,666
A bill that empowers the voters
to recall their elected representative

1689
02:07:56,791 --> 02:07:59,000
before the end of their
five-year tenure…

1690
02:07:59,208 --> 02:08:02,833
if their performance is found lacking.

1691
02:08:03,375 --> 02:08:05,375
To present this bill before the Assembly,

1692
02:08:05,583 --> 02:08:08,041
I invite the Honorable Chief Minister.

1693
02:08:08,125 --> 02:08:10,583
Discussions can be opened
after the presentation of the Bill.

1694
02:08:12,833 --> 02:08:17,291
Sir… a government is not just a word.

1695
02:08:17,791 --> 02:08:19,833
It is a living,
breathing system of functioning…

1696
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
that has a soul and its
own unique identity.

1697
02:08:22,666 --> 02:08:25,000
It is elected by the
people and for that reason,

1698
02:08:25,208 --> 02:08:28,208
they decide how long their elected
representatives, including me,

1699
02:08:28,291 --> 02:08:30,083
should stay in office.

1700
02:08:31,208 --> 02:08:35,250
Copies of the Bill have been circulated
among all the members these past days.

1701
02:08:35,583 --> 02:08:37,375
I humbly call upon all of you…

1702
02:08:37,666 --> 02:08:41,625
to pass this bill and let
it be enforced in Kerala.

1703
02:08:44,083 --> 02:08:46,791
Sir, we call for a vote.

1704
02:08:52,166 --> 02:08:56,416
I request the Honorable Leader
of the opposition…

1705
02:08:56,791 --> 02:08:59,708
to forget for a while that we are in
power and you are in the opposition.

1706
02:09:00,416 --> 02:09:02,791
Let's stand together to get this passed.

1707
02:09:03,250 --> 02:09:05,958
This will be our legacy
for our future generations.

1708
02:09:06,333 --> 02:09:09,125
Sir, in no other state,
has any other government

1709
02:09:09,208 --> 02:09:11,000
presented such a bill before the House.

1710
02:09:11,291 --> 02:09:13,916
So, we are not willing
to pass this unanimously.

1711
02:09:14,500 --> 02:09:16,541
Sir, please conduct a vote.

1712
02:09:16,625 --> 02:09:17,791
That is absolutely essential!

1713
02:09:25,541 --> 02:09:28,458
We have decided to hold
a vote on the Bill.

1714
02:09:32,291 --> 02:09:34,375
Yes Poll… ring the bell!

1715
02:10:29,916 --> 02:10:31,916
Fourteen people have voted in favor…

1716
02:10:33,166 --> 02:10:35,625
and one person has voted to stay neutral.

1717
02:10:37,375 --> 02:10:38,875
Votes against the Bill…

1718
02:10:39,833 --> 02:10:41,250
are 125.

1719
02:10:50,208 --> 02:10:53,041
I rule that this bill is rejected.

1720
02:10:53,250 --> 02:10:55,416
-Shame!
-Shame!

1721
02:10:55,500 --> 02:11:00,875
-The CM should resign!
-The CM should resign!

1722
02:11:00,958 --> 02:11:03,791
-You should resign!
-Resign!

1723
02:11:07,500 --> 02:11:10,083
-What credibility does this survey have?
-Please, be seated!

1724
02:11:17,208 --> 02:11:19,291
Please, be seated!
Please, return to your seats!

1725
02:11:20,500 --> 02:11:23,708
All are requested to return
to their seats! Silence!

1726
02:11:25,166 --> 02:11:27,166
Sir, what was defeated here
today was a heinous move

1727
02:11:27,250 --> 02:11:29,708
to have the elected representatives
of the people removed from office

1728
02:11:29,791 --> 02:11:31,916
by the very people… who voted for them.

1729
02:11:34,208 --> 02:11:35,916
The only "clean politician"
here, the CM…

1730
02:11:36,583 --> 02:11:40,291
tried to protect his future
by picturing every politician

1731
02:11:40,500 --> 02:11:44,041
in this state… as thieves
and exploiters among the people.

1732
02:11:44,541 --> 02:11:48,166
This is exactly what the CM tried to do.

1733
02:11:48,250 --> 02:11:50,916
-The CM should resign!
-The CM should resign!

1734
02:11:51,083 --> 02:11:52,791
Today, right here…

1735
02:11:53,291 --> 02:11:55,458
right now, the CM should quit.

1736
02:11:55,583 --> 02:11:57,541
-Yes! He should quit!
-Yes! He should quit!

1737
02:11:57,625 --> 02:12:00,833
Sir, the CM had such
a historic failure today!

1738
02:12:01,250 --> 02:12:05,125
It's tragic! How can we demand
anything less than his resignation?

1739
02:12:06,083 --> 02:12:09,583
The CM does not have the right to be
in that position for another minute!

1740
02:12:09,708 --> 02:12:14,916
-The CM should resign!
-The CM should resign!

1741
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:19,875
There is no need for them
to clamor for his resignation!

1742
02:12:25,958 --> 02:12:29,750
-Silence!
-The CM should resign!

1743
02:12:29,833 --> 02:12:33,583
Sir, this bill is practically
impossible to execute.

1744
02:12:33,916 --> 02:12:35,583
It could be widely abused.

1745
02:12:36,041 --> 02:12:38,333
We will be conducting
elections year after year.

1746
02:12:39,083 --> 02:12:40,375
The treasury will be emptied!

1747
02:12:40,458 --> 02:12:43,375
Sir, the very political scenario
in the state will be in crisis.

1748
02:12:44,125 --> 02:12:47,208
As you saw, only eight members
voted in favor of the Bill…

1749
02:12:47,291 --> 02:12:49,250
even from the CM's own party.

1750
02:12:49,333 --> 02:12:52,083
-Shame!
-Shame!

1751
02:12:52,166 --> 02:12:54,291
Upon this assembly,
upon this government…

1752
02:12:54,375 --> 02:12:57,916
and upon the people of this state,
the CM has heaped humiliation!

1753
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,625
-Shame!
-Shame!

1754
02:13:01,541 --> 02:13:04,791
What justification do you have for
clinging on to that chair still?

1755
02:13:06,791 --> 02:13:09,916
-The CM should resign!
-The CM should resign!

1756
02:13:10,291 --> 02:13:14,291
-The CM should resign!
-We have no trust in this government, sir!

1757
02:13:16,166 --> 02:13:18,000
What we just saw was a lack of
confidence in the government!

1758
02:13:18,083 --> 02:13:22,083
-Please, sit down!
-Resign! The CM should resign!

1759
02:13:26,375 --> 02:13:27,750
I am taken by surprise, sir…

1760
02:13:28,541 --> 02:13:31,250
that the votes in favor
touched two digits.

1761
02:13:32,291 --> 02:13:36,333
I was fully aware that this
bill would not pass, sir.

1762
02:13:37,083 --> 02:13:39,541
When I presented it here,
I knew what would happen to it.

1763
02:13:39,625 --> 02:13:41,500
Sir, that is just a lame justification!

1764
02:13:41,833 --> 02:13:45,250
It is just a drama to cover up
the humiliating defeat he just faced!

1765
02:13:50,375 --> 02:13:52,875
Hey, silence! Sugunan, please sit!
Let him complete!

1766
02:13:54,541 --> 02:13:56,666
Had this bill become a law…

1767
02:13:56,958 --> 02:14:01,000
how many of our present MLAs
would have continued in office?

1768
02:14:01,250 --> 02:14:02,916
What do you think, Honorable MLA?

1769
02:14:04,166 --> 02:14:06,958
Fourteen! I knew that
figure in advance as well!

1770
02:14:07,875 --> 02:14:10,208
I conducted a survey with
the help of some college students.

1771
02:14:10,291 --> 02:14:11,375
College students?

1772
02:14:11,708 --> 02:14:14,791
The number of MLAs who had the complete
backing of their constituents…

1773
02:14:15,166 --> 02:14:16,208
was also 14!

1774
02:14:17,458 --> 02:14:20,875
They are the ones who
voted in favor of the Bill.

1775
02:14:21,666 --> 02:14:23,375
I am tabling this report in the House…

1776
02:14:23,666 --> 02:14:27,125
of the 140 MLAs in the state. The ones who
have the confidence of their voters…

1777
02:14:27,416 --> 02:14:28,583
are just one-tenth!

1778
02:14:29,166 --> 02:14:32,250
Sir! What survey is the CM talking about?

1779
02:14:32,541 --> 02:14:34,541
None of us have heard about this before!

1780
02:14:34,875 --> 02:14:37,458
Besides, you can't just get
college students to do this stuff!

1781
02:14:39,583 --> 02:14:40,875
Silence!

1782
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:43,083
Please, be seated!

1783
02:14:45,833 --> 02:14:49,458
Sir… the opposition
leader just said here

1784
02:14:50,208 --> 02:14:52,875
that if this bill comes into
force, year after year…

1785
02:14:53,041 --> 02:14:56,208
we will be conducting elections and
the treasury would be emptied.

1786
02:14:56,875 --> 02:14:58,000
But in reality…

1787
02:14:58,416 --> 02:15:01,000
his statement…

1788
02:15:01,583 --> 02:15:04,333
shows his indirect support to this bill.

1789
02:15:05,541 --> 02:15:07,333
If this law is enforced here,

1790
02:15:07,625 --> 02:15:10,166
elected representatives will
do their jobs faithfully…

1791
02:15:10,708 --> 02:15:14,666
and efficiently,
so they can be assured of their position.

1792
02:15:15,291 --> 02:15:18,333
There will be no need for undue
elections or emptying the treasury.

1793
02:15:18,958 --> 02:15:23,375
The people will not try to throw out
their dear, dependable representatives.

1794
02:15:24,500 --> 02:15:27,125
Sir, I had no intentions
to create a revolution here…

1795
02:15:27,500 --> 02:15:29,875
or prove myself
the sole "clean politician"

1796
02:15:30,125 --> 02:15:32,750
in this state by presenting this bill.

1797
02:15:33,833 --> 02:15:36,000
How did we get to step into
this hallowed institution?

1798
02:15:36,666 --> 02:15:40,041
How did each of us get to these chairs
that have our names printed on them?

1799
02:15:40,875 --> 02:15:42,250
Have you ever thought about that?

1800
02:15:42,958 --> 02:15:45,333
It was because of the mercy of
the people who voted for us.

1801
02:15:45,625 --> 02:15:49,458
Our duty is towards them.

1802
02:15:50,041 --> 02:15:52,166
Let's convince ourselves
that it is only towards them.

1803
02:15:53,083 --> 02:15:55,791
Sir, power doesn't corrupt anyone.

1804
02:15:56,041 --> 02:15:59,083
It is people who push
positions of power into corruption.

1805
02:15:59,833 --> 02:16:01,250
All it takes is a single signature

1806
02:16:01,333 --> 02:16:03,291
from you for a lot of good
things to happen here.

1807
02:16:03,375 --> 02:16:05,833
And the same applies
to bad things as well.

1808
02:16:06,875 --> 02:16:09,458
Every time you start doing
something against your conscience

1809
02:16:09,541 --> 02:16:11,291
or have the temptation to do so…

1810
02:16:11,791 --> 02:16:14,208
spare a moment to think about
the voters who got ink stains

1811
02:16:14,291 --> 02:16:16,500
on their fingers to vote
for us and get us elected.

1812
02:16:17,666 --> 02:16:21,500
Sir… each one of us here has been
elected with the help of people's votes.

1813
02:16:23,875 --> 02:16:27,541
Therefore, to conduct
the business of legislation…

1814
02:16:28,250 --> 02:16:31,166
is a constitutional right that
we have and is ours to use.

1815
02:16:32,958 --> 02:16:35,208
We, who are thus empowered…

1816
02:16:35,666 --> 02:16:38,333
have rejected the Bill by a brute
majority and by justifying…

1817
02:16:38,791 --> 02:16:42,291
such a bill over and over again,
the CM is heaping ridicule on himself.

1818
02:16:45,333 --> 02:16:48,291
Sir, this is just playing to the gallery.

1819
02:16:48,375 --> 02:16:50,375
-What is this!
-Shame, sir! Shame!

1820
02:16:51,458 --> 02:16:54,791
Sir, the Honorable Leader of
the opposition does not seem to know…

1821
02:16:55,416 --> 02:16:57,333
but the gallery is for the common man.

1822
02:16:57,958 --> 02:17:01,291
Therefore,
I am certainly playing for them.

1823
02:17:01,875 --> 02:17:04,916
But has anyone ever noticed
where the gallery is?

1824
02:17:05,541 --> 02:17:09,333
There! Far above where we are sitting!

1825
02:17:11,541 --> 02:17:13,958
Sir, what is the CM talking about?

1826
02:17:14,208 --> 02:17:17,666
This is not a stage to fire up
your followers with catchy slogans!

1827
02:17:17,750 --> 02:17:20,166
It is a divine institution
of our democracy!

1828
02:17:20,250 --> 02:17:21,958
Where is it, sir? Where is that democracy?

1829
02:17:22,166 --> 02:17:25,250
Is anyone sitting over there
allowed to speak a word here?

1830
02:17:25,750 --> 02:17:27,916
They are not even
allowed to stand up here.

1831
02:17:28,125 --> 02:17:31,625
All they can do is sit
and watch in silence…

1832
02:17:31,708 --> 02:17:35,708
while the people they voted to power
say and do whatever they wish to!

1833
02:17:36,166 --> 02:17:37,458
Sir, this is an assembly.

1834
02:17:37,875 --> 02:17:40,250
Some protocols and
restrictions are followed here.

1835
02:17:40,500 --> 02:17:42,500
Shouldn't we be more
thankful to the public, sir?

1836
02:17:43,666 --> 02:17:47,541
Including you and me, they are the ones
who give everything to everyone here.

1837
02:17:47,750 --> 02:17:50,375
The houses we stay in,
the cars we travel in,

1838
02:17:50,583 --> 02:17:53,750
the gadgets we use, the food we
eat, even the clothes we wear!

1839
02:17:54,041 --> 02:17:55,458
It is all given to us by them!

1840
02:17:55,916 --> 02:17:57,541
They are the ones who should rule us!

1841
02:17:58,916 --> 02:18:02,416
Sir, it is we, who should stand when
we see them, not the other way around!

1842
02:18:05,208 --> 02:18:07,583
A democratic government is not
meant to rule over the people.

1843
02:18:07,666 --> 02:18:09,125
It is meant to rule for the people!

1844
02:18:12,958 --> 02:18:15,916
And to those who are clamoring
for my resignation…

1845
02:18:16,875 --> 02:18:21,125
you don't need to strain yourselves!
The minute I lost the vote…

1846
02:18:21,291 --> 02:18:23,375
my resignation letter was
handed over to the Governor

1847
02:18:23,458 --> 02:18:24,875
through my political secretary!

1848
02:18:34,166 --> 02:18:35,083
Sir…

1849
02:18:35,708 --> 02:18:38,000
with your permission,
may I speak a few more words here?

1850
02:18:49,458 --> 02:18:52,333
I am now standing before you…

1851
02:18:52,958 --> 02:18:54,208
not as your chief minister,

1852
02:18:55,250 --> 02:18:57,291
but as an ordinary
representative of the people…

1853
02:18:57,375 --> 02:18:59,458
who wished to see some things change.

1854
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:02,500
I am only starting a process.

1855
02:19:03,708 --> 02:19:05,000
It may be…

1856
02:19:05,708 --> 02:19:08,916
the next or fifth or seventh or
even tenth chief minister after me,

1857
02:19:09,291 --> 02:19:10,708
who will put this into action.

1858
02:19:11,208 --> 02:19:12,416
I am just a catalyst.

1859
02:19:13,708 --> 02:19:17,541
I am stepping down from my
position with confidence…

1860
02:19:19,583 --> 02:19:22,166
with the happiness…

1861
02:19:23,708 --> 02:19:24,833
and the belief…

1862
02:19:25,458 --> 02:19:28,958
that some failures are greater than
some of the greatest victories.

1863
02:19:30,666 --> 02:19:33,916
I am only leaving from here, but…

1864
02:19:36,083 --> 02:19:39,916
the doors to my house will
always be open to all of you.

1865
02:19:41,625 --> 02:19:45,083
And when I say "my house," I don't mean
the official residence I am living in now.

1866
02:19:45,875 --> 02:19:50,083
I mean my own house…
that my father left me.

1867
02:19:51,291 --> 02:19:52,750
I will wait for you there…

1868
02:19:54,291 --> 02:19:57,250
to listen to what you have to say.

1869
02:19:59,208 --> 02:20:00,666
And I only have you to listen to.

1870
02:20:02,083 --> 02:20:03,666
Politics to me…

1871
02:20:05,333 --> 02:20:09,791
is not a tool to establish my
power or supremacy over the people.

1872
02:20:11,500 --> 02:20:15,208
Being a politician, to me, is a means
to stand along with the people…

1873
02:20:15,958 --> 02:20:17,333
and do some good…

1874
02:20:18,833 --> 02:20:19,791
for them.

1875
02:22:22,166 --> 02:22:24,083
<i>The Chief Minister</i>
<i>Kadakkal Chandran has resigned</i>

1876
02:22:24,166 --> 02:22:27,166
<i>following the failure in the Assembly…</i>

1877
02:22:27,333 --> 02:22:29,375
<i>of the much-awaited Right to Recall Bill.</i>

1878
02:22:32,250 --> 02:22:36,500
<i>The Chief Minister, to the shock of all,</i>
<i>declared his resignation in the Assembly.</i>

1879
02:22:50,958 --> 02:22:52,708
-Hey, slow down!
-Yeah.

1880
02:22:54,708 --> 02:22:57,125
Mom, what is this "Right to Recall"
that is in the syllabus?

1881
02:22:57,416 --> 02:23:00,375
Your dad's on the phone. Hey,
did your leave application get approved?

1882
02:23:00,958 --> 02:23:03,208
Grandpa, can you explain this to me?

1883
02:23:09,416 --> 02:23:12,000
Ask Uncle Sanal about
this when you see him.

1884
02:23:12,208 --> 02:23:14,000
He'll be able to explain
it better than me.

1885
02:23:14,750 --> 02:23:18,083
This was first presented before
the Assembly by the then Chief Minister.

1886
02:23:18,333 --> 02:23:19,583
What was his name?

1887
02:23:20,333 --> 02:23:22,166
What is the present
Chief Minister's name?

1888
02:24:41,916 --> 02:24:43,500
This applause is for change.

1889
02:24:44,333 --> 02:24:45,625
It is a proclamation…

1890
02:24:45,958 --> 02:24:48,708
that what we do today will be
followed by the world tomorrow.

1891
02:24:52,500 --> 02:24:56,250
It is your ink-stained forefingers…

1892
02:24:56,666 --> 02:24:58,041
that will show me the way forward.

1893
02:24:59,750 --> 02:25:01,625
Henceforth, no authority…

1894
02:25:01,916 --> 02:25:04,625
leader or minister…

1895
02:25:05,041 --> 02:25:07,375
but you, shall be number one!
