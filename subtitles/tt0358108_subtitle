to get court marshaled.

701
00:49:26,434 --> 00:49:29,504
I'd like it if their choice
could be cemented forever.

702
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:33,989
If you agree to this proposal,
I'll consider myself lucky.

703
00:49:34,663 --> 00:49:37,841
I've brought the snaps of my
daughter with me.

704
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:39,507
Take a look.

705
00:49:58,090 --> 00:50:01,405
Look, mother,
she even knows how to dance.

706
00:50:01,607 --> 00:50:04,655
Yes, she dances very well.
She has learnt it with dedication.

707
00:50:04,812 --> 00:50:06,618
The she must've learnt singing too.

708
00:50:07,015 --> 00:50:08,338
Yes, she can sing a little.

709
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,849
- What else has she learnt?
- Actually...

710
00:50:12,031 --> 00:50:15,507
The skill to trap affluent boys also.

711
00:50:17,534 --> 00:50:18,668
I don't get it.

712
00:50:18,844 --> 00:50:22,620
My son is rich but he is simple.

713
00:50:23,314 --> 00:50:27,628
You want to misguide
him to seize his wealth.

714
00:50:28,606 --> 00:50:31,058
You wouldn't be capable
of giving a dowry?

715
00:50:32,419 --> 00:50:36,137
Listen, I'm an army officer
and serve respectfully...

716
00:50:36,337 --> 00:50:38,545
...so I won't be able to give a dowry.

717
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:41,024
But my daughter is
virtuous and respectful.

718
00:50:41,717 --> 00:50:42,929
Respectful?

719
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,911
The girl who dances with
anklets on her feet can't...

720
00:50:47,483 --> 00:50:49,372
...be our daughter-in-law.

721
00:50:49,724 --> 00:50:53,204
Mrs. Bhavani,
you're insulting me and my daughter.

722
00:50:53,298 --> 00:50:55,121
I erred by bringing a proposal here.

723
00:50:55,215 --> 00:50:58,403
Did we send you a
procession to call you here?

724
00:50:58,497 --> 00:51:02,523
No, but had I known you're so
rude I won't have come here.

725
00:51:02,617 --> 00:51:05,135
You make your daughter dance
in front of thousands...

726
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:07,251
...and you're pointing out my faults.

727
00:51:07,345 --> 00:51:09,054
Mrs. Bhavani,
you're crossing your limits.

728
00:51:09,148 --> 00:51:11,018
Instead of ruining a decent house...

729
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:13,613
...get her to join a troupe.

730
00:51:13,857 --> 00:51:16,309
I know what I've to do with my daughter.

731
00:51:16,776 --> 00:51:18,891
But my daughter will
never come to the house...

732
00:51:18,985 --> 00:51:21,632
...where the mother-in-law is like you.
Got it?

733
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:28,471
Shobha!

734
00:51:29,433 --> 00:51:33,755
I fear that Prakash might
get trapped by that girl.

735
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:37,319
We should get him married quickly.

736
00:51:38,753 --> 00:51:41,215
I'll send Sukhlal to fetch him tomorrow.

737
00:51:41,847 --> 00:51:43,745
- There.
- There.

738
00:51:43,946 --> 00:51:46,075
- Can I go inside, guard?
- Yes.

739
00:51:48,487 --> 00:51:51,545
Don't remove your shoes. It's fine here.

740
00:51:51,639 --> 00:51:54,110
Consider it your own regiment.

741
00:51:55,044 --> 00:51:57,147
Please sit and relax there.

742
00:51:59,585 --> 00:52:02,514
Lord Ram! Ram!

743
00:52:05,833 --> 00:52:07,165
Disgusting.

744
00:52:09,977 --> 00:52:11,980
[HUMMING]

745
00:52:17,055 --> 00:52:19,321
Looks like you're still a bachelor.

746
00:52:20,786 --> 00:52:22,595
How did you come to know?

747
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:26,519
Looking at all these posters
you've put up on the wall...

748
00:52:26,613 --> 00:52:28,687
...like a juice centre.

749
00:52:28,781 --> 00:52:31,303
What can I do, Mr. Dukhlal?
I mean Mr. Sukhlal.

750
00:52:31,539 --> 00:52:34,085
- I can't sleep in the night.
- Really?

751
00:52:34,179 --> 00:52:38,231
Yes! I look at these snaps and
when the eyes get tired...

752
00:52:38,324 --> 00:52:40,045
...I'm able to sleep for a while.

753
00:52:40,139 --> 00:52:41,736
Then why don't you get married?

754
00:52:41,830 --> 00:52:45,244
I'm ready to get married,
but I can't find a girl.

755
00:52:45,338 --> 00:52:48,613
A handsome young man like you should
never be short of female company.

756
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:50,772
That's right. There are lots of girls.

757
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:54,476
- But I want someone different.
- Oh.

758
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:56,785
Someone who has eyes like Zeenat Amaan.

759
00:52:57,170 --> 00:53:00,535
Nose like Hema Malini
and lips like Raakhi.

760
00:53:00,893 --> 00:53:03,668
I asked you everything but
I didn't ask your name?

761
00:53:04,308 --> 00:53:10,521
Yes, that got left out.
I'm Totaram, a single bird.

762
00:53:10,615 --> 00:53:13,074
- Then an alliance is already made.
- Alliance? What alliance?

763
00:53:13,168 --> 00:53:17,424
Your name is Totaram and my
daughter's name is Maina.

764
00:53:17,518 --> 00:53:19,189
Even she's still a maiden.

765
00:53:19,791 --> 00:53:24,218
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
I'll just come.

766
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:30,977
[HUMMING]

767
00:53:40,912 --> 00:53:43,162
Why are you taking all this
trouble, friend?

768
00:53:43,256 --> 00:53:47,139
It's no trouble. We get it at
a discount in the army canteen.

769
00:53:47,233 --> 00:53:48,651
Please help yourself.

770
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:52,407
- How is it?
- Good. Pungent.

771
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:56,231
- I was asking about the girl.
- Girl?

772
00:53:56,862 --> 00:53:59,625
- Oh! Maina.
- Yes, yes, Mania.

773
00:53:59,934 --> 00:54:01,685
She's form the village,
but very beautiful.

774
00:54:01,956 --> 00:54:05,145
And she's expert in
doing house-hold chores.

775
00:54:07,066 --> 00:54:09,465
- How are her eyes?
- Eyes.

776
00:54:10,726 --> 00:54:12,804
- Like this.
- Like Zeenat Amaan.

777
00:54:12,898 --> 00:54:13,949
- Absolutely.
- Great.

778
00:54:14,043 --> 00:54:16,861
- And her nose?
- Nose?

779
00:54:17,258 --> 00:54:18,662
Nose? Like this.

780
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:20,069
- Like Hema Malini?
- Yes.

781
00:54:20,163 --> 00:54:23,941
- Wow, wow! And her lips?
- Lips.

782
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:25,602
Like these.

783
00:54:26,676 --> 00:54:28,692
- Lips like Rakhee.
- Forget this.

784
00:54:28,786 --> 00:54:30,145
Come to our village and see her.

785
00:54:30,238 --> 00:54:32,738
No need to see her now, father-in-law.

786
00:54:33,067 --> 00:54:36,304
When I've seen you,
it's as good as seeing the girl.

787
00:54:36,793 --> 00:54:39,726
Kindly sit relaxed. Like this.

788
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:42,430
Okay. Like this.

789
00:54:42,524 --> 00:54:45,812
- But should I keep this plate in my hands?
- Yes. Hold it.

790
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:47,860
Don't move. Don't move.

791
00:54:48,275 --> 00:54:50,125
Are you clicking my snap?

792
00:54:50,853 --> 00:54:52,311
Got it.

793
00:54:52,507 --> 00:54:55,700
Now I'll remove all these snaps...

794
00:54:55,974 --> 00:54:57,318
...and put yours...

795
00:54:57,411 --> 00:54:59,075
...and pray day and night.

796
00:54:59,775 --> 00:55:02,092
You looks decent and
from a respectful family.

797
00:55:02,186 --> 00:55:05,884
- Visit our village sometime.
- I'll definitely come.

798
00:55:05,977 --> 00:55:08,211
- I'll apply for leave right away.
- Ok.

799
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:12,113
- Because due to Mr. Prakash
we've become close. - Ok.

800
00:55:12,419 --> 00:55:13,783
- Totaram!
- Yes?

801
00:55:13,877 --> 00:55:15,102
Bring the keys of my room.

802
00:55:15,196 --> 00:55:16,707
- Yes.
- Mr. Prakash has come.

803
00:55:16,801 --> 00:55:18,606
- Come.
- Let's go.

804
00:55:18,905 --> 00:55:20,527
Welcome, uncle Sukhlal. Sit.

805
00:55:22,302 --> 00:55:23,602
How come you are here suddenly?

806
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:25,354
I'll tell that to you later.

807
00:55:25,731 --> 00:55:27,347
First have these sweets.

808
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:30,060
Sheila has sent them especially for you.

809
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:36,650
I'm eating sweets made by
sister-in-law after a long time.

810
00:55:37,433 --> 00:55:38,682
Poor soul.

811
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:42,527
But uncle, why did she send these?

812
00:55:42,621 --> 00:55:43,809
She only knows it.

813
00:55:44,096 --> 00:55:46,037
Anyway madam has called you.

814
00:55:46,404 --> 00:55:48,117
You must've received her letter.

815
00:55:49,786 --> 00:55:51,020
Got it, uncle.

816
00:55:52,176 --> 00:55:55,760
What's the point in meeting
the girl I don't want to marry?

817
00:55:56,321 --> 00:55:58,746
Why? Have you found one here?

818
00:55:59,787 --> 00:56:02,565
Yes, uncle. Is she from a good family?

819
00:56:02,887 --> 00:56:06,329
Uncle, Durga is the daughter
of colonel Gupta of our academy.

820
00:56:07,295 --> 00:56:08,715
Colonel Gupta?

821
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:10,674
- Didn't you say Colonel Gupta?
- Yes.

822
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:14,277
Why? What is it, uncle?

823
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:16,072
It's a problem.

824
00:56:16,486 --> 00:56:17,647
What problem?

825
00:56:18,322 --> 00:56:21,399
First finish the food.
I'll tell you later.

826
00:56:23,045 --> 00:56:24,870
- It shouldn't have happened.
- What?

827
00:56:26,099 --> 00:56:27,974
Colonel had come with a proposal...

828
00:56:28,445 --> 00:56:30,149
...but madam insulted him very badly.

829
00:56:30,394 --> 00:56:33,024
- She didn't even offer tea to him.
- Tea!

830
00:56:35,788 --> 00:56:37,825
Why did you take the
trouble, Mr. Totaram?

831
00:56:37,919 --> 00:56:41,247
What is the trouble in serving our people?
Isn't it, sir?

832
00:56:43,399 --> 00:56:45,111
- Please take it.
- Go ahead, uncle.

833
00:56:45,714 --> 00:56:47,181
Have tea, sir.
Tea.

834
00:56:51,002 --> 00:56:52,007
Uncle.

835
00:56:53,908 --> 00:56:55,821
We should go to colonel's
house immediately.

836
00:56:56,783 --> 00:56:58,098
Mother has insulted him.

837
00:56:58,959 --> 00:57:01,003
- I should apologise.
- Yes let's go.

838
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,135
Uncle.

839
00:57:06,907 --> 00:57:08,026
He left.

840
00:57:08,702 --> 00:57:10,835
Remember the alliance of Tota and Maina.

841
00:57:11,809 --> 00:57:13,527
No, Prakash, this isn't possible now.

842
00:57:14,045 --> 00:57:16,986
I can never forget your
mother's behaviour.

843
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:18,522
That was most insulting.

844
00:57:18,616 --> 00:57:20,610
If she wasn't interested
in our proposal...

845
00:57:20,878 --> 00:57:21,970
...she could've refused it.

846
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:23,855
- What was the need to insult?
- Yes.

847
00:57:23,949 --> 00:57:26,070
I apologise for her behaviour, sir.

848
00:57:27,059 --> 00:57:29,351
I apologise on her behalf.

849
00:57:30,054 --> 00:57:32,141
Still I can't agree for this marriage.

850
00:57:32,788 --> 00:57:35,913
I can't send my daughter
to the woman who...

851
00:57:36,205 --> 00:57:39,124
...treats her daughter-in-law
worse than a beast.

852
00:57:41,688 --> 00:57:45,044
I'm taking the responsibility
of Durga's future, sir.

853
00:57:45,395 --> 00:57:47,617
- But you...
- I assure you.

854
00:57:47,913 --> 00:57:50,693
Durga will never have
to enter that house.

855
00:57:51,014 --> 00:57:52,741
- How is it possible?
- Sir.

856
00:57:53,417 --> 00:57:56,126
You're know I'll become an officer soon.

857
00:57:56,986 --> 00:57:59,365
I'll have a good job, a place to stay...

858
00:57:59,629 --> 00:58:02,171
...respect and everything.

859
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:03,689
We'll stay here, sir.

860
00:58:04,297 --> 00:58:06,786
You mean to say you won't
live in your mother's house?

861
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:10,525
No, sir.
I don't desire my mother's wealth.

862
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:13,393
Durga is well aware of it.

863
00:58:15,381 --> 00:58:16,509
Dear Durga.

864
00:58:17,536 --> 00:58:19,166
This concerns your future.

865
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:21,968
Before I take a decision
I want to know your opinion.

866
00:58:22,564 --> 00:58:24,900
Papa, I'm aware of everything.

867
00:58:24,994 --> 00:58:27,490
I can stay in any state with him.

868
00:58:27,766 --> 00:58:31,536
Now she has also agreed, sir.
Please agree.

869
00:58:32,256 --> 00:58:35,526
Look, they make a good couple.

870
00:58:36,976 --> 00:58:39,273
When Durga doesn't
have to go that house...

871
00:58:39,559 --> 00:58:40,847

- He'll offer it to the Goddess.
- No.

1046
01:09:05,636 --> 01:09:07,457
- Why Sheila's bracelets?
- Why not?

1047
01:09:08,301 --> 01:09:09,893
Is she going to take them to the grave?

1048
01:09:10,448 --> 01:09:11,442
Give it.

1049
01:09:11,945 --> 01:09:12,974
Here.

1050
01:09:13,910 --> 01:09:15,909
O God!

1051
01:09:24,263 --> 01:09:25,887
Is anybody there?

1052
01:09:31,051 --> 01:09:32,429
I said...

1053
01:09:34,371 --> 01:09:35,937
Whom do you want?

1054
01:09:36,478 --> 01:09:40,205
Yes, my father-in-law...
I mean is Mr. Sukhlal, here.

1055
01:09:41,925 --> 01:09:44,872
Sukhlal! Somebody has come to meet you.

1056
01:09:47,979 --> 01:09:49,256
Thank you.

1057
01:09:52,490 --> 01:09:54,526
- Totaram.
- Yes.

1058
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:55,656
Come.

1059
01:09:56,053 --> 01:09:59,382
Who is the man who called you?

1060
01:09:59,661 --> 01:10:01,886
- Son-in-law of this house.
- Son-in-law.

1061
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:05,204
- He's distributing offering. Have some.
- Okay.

1062
01:10:06,601 --> 01:10:08,131
It's not an offering.

1063
01:10:08,224 --> 01:10:11,090
It's a pudding from Hotel Naryan made
in kerosene.

1064
01:10:11,356 --> 01:10:15,144
I saw this man buying
this pudding from there.

1065
01:10:15,326 --> 01:10:17,002
He's a crooked son-in-law.

1066
01:10:17,096 --> 01:10:18,326
Good Lord!

1067
01:10:18,966 --> 01:10:20,208
This is the limit.

1068
01:10:20,516 --> 01:10:23,539
This means all this drama was to get...

1069
01:10:23,633 --> 01:10:25,761
...daughter-in-law's bracelets.

1070
01:10:26,592 --> 01:10:29,807
In this manner he'll ruin this house.

1071
01:10:30,430 --> 01:10:31,463
No, no.

1072
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:34,357
I'll have to go to town and
inform Mr. Prakash about it.

1073
01:10:34,795 --> 01:10:36,134
Everything.

1074
01:10:36,723 --> 01:10:41,048
He distributed pudding as an offering.
Disgusting!

1075
01:10:41,344 --> 01:10:45,369
Not just that,
he took daughter-in-law's bangles.

1076
01:10:45,819 --> 01:10:48,274
He said he had vowed to
offer it to the Goddess.

1077
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:50,302
With a mother-in-law like
that forget bangles...

1078
01:10:50,731 --> 01:10:52,073
...he'll even sell off the house.

1079
01:10:52,301 --> 01:10:53,931
But our mother won't understand it.

1080
01:10:54,221 --> 01:10:56,438
He's being applauded and the son and...

1081
01:10:57,018 --> 01:11:00,184
...daughter-in-law aren't
even getting proper food.

1082
01:11:01,251 --> 01:11:03,596
Veena doesn't even have
a toy to play with.

1083
01:11:04,270 --> 01:11:06,506
And whenever he comes, he doesn't leave...

1084
01:11:06,724 --> 01:11:09,332
...without taking at least
goods worth 8 to 10000.

1085
01:11:10,354 --> 01:11:13,797
But why don't your brother and
sister Sheila say something.

1086
01:11:14,326 --> 01:11:16,422
Durga, you don't know
anything about our house.

1087
01:11:17,472 --> 01:11:19,490
Our father was a very brave man.

1088
01:11:20,001 --> 01:11:22,357
But whatever clout he had
was outside the house.

1089
01:11:23,734 --> 01:11:25,713
Mother always ruled the house.

1090
01:11:26,679 --> 01:11:28,344
When father couldn't
do a thing what will...

1091
01:11:28,806 --> 01:11:30,133
...brother and sister-in-law do?

1092
01:11:32,119 --> 01:11:34,968
But the responsibility
of our house is ours too.

1093
01:11:35,062 --> 01:11:36,849
Which house?

1094
01:11:37,605 --> 01:11:40,246
- I've forgotten that house forever.
- No, sir.

1095
01:11:40,699 --> 01:11:41,960
Don't say that.

1096
01:11:42,571 --> 01:11:44,367
I'm not talking about the...

1097
01:11:44,461 --> 01:11:47,047
...materialistic value of that house.

1098
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:53,379
But think of the living souls
that can't utter a word.

1099
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,087
Those who have suppressed their desires...

1100
01:11:56,181 --> 01:11:58,058
...and are suffering everything.

1101
01:11:58,924 --> 01:12:01,555
I want to know how long
will all this go on.

1102
01:12:01,742 --> 01:12:04,431
Sukhlal uncle, even I've a heart.

1103
01:12:05,232 --> 01:12:07,100
I'm related to them.

1104
01:12:07,424 --> 01:12:08,694
Even I think a lot...

1105
01:12:09,024 --> 01:12:11,341
...but does anything happen
without mother's consent?

1106
01:12:12,281 --> 01:12:15,459
I've often told brother and
sister-in-law to come here.

1107
01:12:15,763 --> 01:12:17,189
And I'm telling you too.

1108
01:12:17,411 --> 01:12:21,100
That house isn't for humans.
Why don't you stay with us?

1109
01:12:21,667 --> 01:12:23,207
Why should I?

1110
01:12:23,842 --> 01:12:25,970
You call them your blood relatives...

1111
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:29,268
...but you don't want to have
anything to do with them.

1112
01:12:30,083 --> 01:12:33,816
I'm a servant. My loyalty is with them.

1113
01:12:34,777 --> 01:12:37,034
I can't ignore them. Bye.

1114
01:12:37,938 --> 01:12:42,513
- Sukhlal uncle.
- I came with great expectations, but fine.

1115
01:12:43,594 --> 01:12:47,820
Whatever God has willed will happen.

1116
01:12:54,866 --> 01:12:59,871
'Think of those living
souls who can't speak.'

1117
01:13:24,318 --> 01:13:26,387
'The train-set you had sent for me was...'

1118
01:13:26,481 --> 01:13:28,750
'...snatched and given to Pappu.'

1119
01:13:33,804 --> 01:13:37,326
'My wife and I wanted
to see you as a groom.'

1120
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:39,627
'But mother's anger buried our desire.'

1121
01:13:45,096 --> 01:13:47,025
Durga, why have you woken up?

1122
01:13:48,788 --> 01:13:49,955
I can't sleep.

1123
01:13:51,584 --> 01:13:52,427
Why?

1124
01:13:54,435 --> 01:13:55,643
What is it?

1125
01:13:56,337 --> 01:13:58,686
- Can I ask you something?
- Yes.

1126
01:13:59,216 --> 01:14:02,468
- Will you listen to me?
- Have I ever refused you?

1127
01:14:02,878 --> 01:14:04,804
- Tell me, what is it?
- Promise me.

1128
01:14:06,671 --> 01:14:08,067
I promise.

1129
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:13,855
- I want to go to my in-laws' house.
- What?

1130
01:14:14,416 --> 01:14:16,404
In-laws' house? Are you in your senses?

1131
01:14:16,838 --> 01:14:18,272
Absolutely.

1132
01:14:19,143 --> 01:14:21,900
We've such a big house and a family.

1133
01:14:22,228 --> 01:14:24,394
Then why should we live
away like strangers.

1134
01:14:24,778 --> 01:14:27,009
Why are you getting this
idiotic notion suddenly?

1135
01:14:27,103 --> 01:14:31,132
Not suddenly, I had thought
about this before marriage.

1136
01:14:31,311 --> 01:14:34,360
Before marriage?

1137
01:14:35,305 --> 01:14:38,624
This means you want to
avenge your father's insult.

1138
01:14:38,865 --> 01:14:42,530
- No, it's not like that.
- So why do you insist to go there.

1139
01:14:42,866 --> 01:14:44,208
Why don't you understand?

1140
01:14:44,946 --> 01:14:49,179
The tears in Sukhlal
uncle's eyes forced me to...

1141
01:14:50,158 --> 01:14:52,829
...think about those poor souls.

1142
01:14:53,835 --> 01:14:55,868
I'm getting restless thinking about...

1143
01:14:56,384 --> 01:14:59,675
...your brother, sister-in-law and Veena.

1144
01:15:00,667 --> 01:15:02,920
We've to go there, please.

1145
01:15:04,054 --> 01:15:07,441
But listen. My mother won't
even let you into the house.

1146
01:15:08,966 --> 01:15:13,873
I'm sure I'll receive
her love and blessing.

1147
01:15:14,651 --> 01:15:16,908
Love and blessings from my mother?

1148
01:15:17,649 --> 01:15:20,281
No matter what, we'll go.
You've promised me.

1149
01:15:20,582 --> 01:15:23,163
Okay, but we'll go with a return ticket.

1150
01:15:23,676 --> 01:15:26,253
Because we'll have to
return from the doorstep.

1151
01:15:27,132 --> 01:15:28,839
- Shall we leave right now?
- Tomorrow.

1152
01:15:28,933 --> 01:15:29,789
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.

1153
01:15:29,883 --> 01:15:31,467
Fine. Let's go to sleep now.

1154
01:15:36,516 --> 01:15:40,847
God, I'm going today with
a big responsibility.

1155
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:45,828
Grant me strength to fulfil it.

1156
01:15:55,784 --> 01:16:00,659
- Papa. - Dear, when you've decided
to go, I won't stop you.

1157
01:16:01,086 --> 01:16:03,936
But my heart says you'll
not be happy there.

1158
01:16:06,651 --> 01:16:12,273
Papa, after marriage in-law's
house is the girl's house.

1159
01:16:13,416 --> 01:16:17,094
Bless me so that I can bring
happiness in that house.

1160
01:16:19,054 --> 01:16:21,728
I would bless you that...

1161
01:16:22,361 --> 01:16:26,350
...you succeed to change your
mother-in-law's feelings for you.

1162
01:16:33,730 --> 01:16:34,826
Mother!

1163
01:16:37,139 --> 01:16:42,326
Always treat your mother-in-law's
problems as your problems.

1164
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:47,001
A daughter-in-law's duty is to serve her.

1165
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:50,487
- Go, dear.
- Mother.

1166
01:17:10,899 --> 01:17:12,576
[CAR STOPPED SOUND]

1167
01:17:20,725 --> 01:17:21,757
Sister-in-law!

1168
01:17:22,477 --> 01:17:23,679
Prakash, you!

1169
01:17:26,753 --> 01:17:27,953
Greetings.

1170
01:17:28,454 --> 01:17:30,492
Don't come in, brother-in-law. Wait here.

1171
01:17:30,586 --> 01:17:31,613
But...

1172
01:17:36,135 --> 01:17:38,313
Greetings, young master, young madam.

1173
01:17:38,583 --> 01:17:41,071
- Greetings, uncle Shuklal. How are you?
- Everything is fine.

1174
01:17:41,165 --> 01:17:43,909
- Brother driver, help me unload.
- Come.

1175
01:17:44,686 --> 01:17:47,067
Go, daughter. Go quickly.

1176
01:18:12,794 --> 01:18:16,866
Now come inside. No, not you.
First sister-in-law will enter.

1177
01:18:17,603 --> 01:18:21,232
Goddess Laxmi is entering
in the form of new bride.

1178
01:18:22,037 --> 01:18:27,000
Durga, with your foot
topple the urn filled with...

1179
01:18:27,730 --> 01:18:30,270
...grains and hop over
and enter the house.

1180
01:18:30,828 --> 01:18:34,072
So that there is never a
dearth of grains in your house.

1181
01:18:39,577 --> 01:18:40,848
Wait!

1182
01:18:42,198 --> 01:18:43,384
Wait there.

1183
01:18:43,903 --> 01:18:47,328
Silli, who had told you to do all this?

1184
01:18:47,682 --> 01:18:48,853
Go inside.

1185
01:18:59,393 --> 01:19:00,497
Shobha.

1186
01:19:01,884 --> 01:19:04,274
Who are these strangers at our door?

1187
01:19:05,338 --> 01:19:06,467
Strangers?

1188
01:19:07,647 --> 01:19:10,658
We aren't strangers, mother, it's us.

1189
01:19:10,752 --> 01:19:13,052
Shobha, tell them...

1190
01:19:14,124 --> 01:19:15,585
...I don't recognise them.

1191
01:19:16,217 --> 01:19:19,550
Sister, tell her,
her younger son has come with him...

1192
01:19:20,234 --> 01:19:23,723
...his wife, the daughter-in-law
of this house has come.

1193
01:19:24,444 --> 01:19:28,904
I had a younger son, but he's no more.

1194
01:19:32,174 --> 01:19:35,446
Consider the dignity of
your age before you speak.

1195
01:19:35,624 --> 01:19:38,441
Heard, mother?
She's her to teach you wisdom.

1196
01:19:39,010 --> 01:19:41,682
Throw her out of here.

1197
01:19:42,715 --> 01:19:44,789
Her father had declared proudly that...

1198
01:19:44,883 --> 01:19:47,970
...my daughter will
never enter your house.

1199
01:19:48,357 --> 01:19:49,461
Then why are you here?

1200
01:19:49,555 --> 01:19:50,905
They told you.

1201
01:19:51,305 --> 01:19:52,938
I had not said anything.

1202
01:19:53,552 --> 01:19:55,341
I'm the new daughter-in-law
of this house.

1203
01:19:56,053 --> 01:19:58,122
I've come to my house...

1204
01:19:58,790 --> 01:20:00,668
- ...and I won't stop now.
- Durga.

1205
01:20:01,127 --> 01:20:03,179
This is the limit. Let's leave.

1206
01:20:03,273 --> 01:20:04,276
No.

1207
01:20:04,726 --> 01:20:07,302
I'll complete the rituals and enter...

1208
01:20:08,305 --> 01:20:11,144
- ...at any cost.
- Really?

1209
01:20:12,217 --> 01:20:13,413
Is it so?

1210
01:20:13,709 --> 01:20:16,673
Then I'll kick the rituals out.

1211
01:20:22,354 --> 01:20:23,820
I'm telling you to leave.

1212
01:20:24,217 --> 01:20:25,497
Go away.

1213
01:20:54,990 --> 01:20:57,037

01:32:37,848 --> 01:32:40,342
But you always write
that you won't return...

1389
01:32:40,436 --> 01:32:43,486
...before achieving the goal
for which you went there.

1391
01:32:46,281 --> 01:32:47,873
What would be her goal?

1392
01:32:47,966 --> 01:32:50,038
What else, mother?

1393
01:32:50,367 --> 01:32:52,585
She wants her right.

1394
01:32:53,021 --> 01:32:55,549
She has started with farms and orchards.

1395
01:32:56,170 --> 01:32:57,266

I'll see her.

You must've understood
my mother's nature.

1398
01:33:04,095 --> 01:33:05,721
She's a tyrant.

1399
01:33:05,904 --> 01:33:09,684
She is obsessed with power and wealth.

Oh God! God!

01:33:12,210 --> 01:33:13,815

What does my brother-in-law write ahead?

Even God can restrict
her atrocities and greed.

1406

My elder sister...

01:33:28,953 --> 01:33:30,435

[PAPER RUSTLE]

1411
01:33:39,940 --> 01:33:43,880
My elder sister Shobha
Devi must be fulfilling...

1412
01:33:44,503 --> 01:33:50,201
...her duty by instigating mother.

1413
01:33:54,987 --> 01:33:58,451
Such a sister, who ruins her brother's...

1414
01:33:58,914 --> 01:34:00,290
...married life, is a bane.

1415
01:34:00,589 --> 01:34:02,588
May he ruin!

01:34:03,285 --> 01:34:05,514

I think you should read further, mother.

My dutiful, kind and able

What can I write about his greatness!

1423

Even humans have qualities of animals.

Some are as simple as a cow.

Some are brave and kind like lion.

- To hell.
- Granny, why do you say so?

did you check the farms and fields?

Yes.

Now see the houses on rent.

Get the details about them.

Check the accounts of the rents.

interfere in our family matters.

to the farms with Silli?

To see our farms and workers.

- Yes, sir.

But I can't live in quarters
with you after marriage.

1479
01:37:36,039 --> 01:37:39,165
- Why?
- Because the quarters door is small.

- So I've rented a garage.
- Okay.

I said no.

1734
01:54:09,053 --> 01:54:12,748
Mother, won't you give us the money?

1735
01:54:13,446 --> 01:54:14,432
No.

1736
01:54:29,644 --> 01:54:31,741
Lalla. Lalla. She...

1737
01:54:46,407 --> 01:54:47,951
I've taken 500 rupees.

1738
01:54:48,602 --> 01:54:50,548
Oh God! Oh God!

1739
01:54:51,129 --> 01:54:53,635
She's become so arrogant.

1740
01:54:54,200 --> 01:54:56,940
She has insulted mother so badly.

1741
01:54:58,358 --> 01:54:59,522
Take it.

1742
01:54:59,947 --> 01:55:01,931
Go and put shroud on the girl.

1743
01:55:03,242 --> 01:55:04,777
You should be ashamed of yourself.

1744
01:55:08,775 --> 01:55:10,527
I can't bear it.

1745
01:55:11,631 --> 01:55:14,174
I can't bear it anymore, mother.

1746
01:55:14,594 --> 01:55:16,635
Enough. It's the limit.

1747
01:55:17,192 --> 01:55:19,730
- We had to be so humiliated.
- Calm down.

1748
01:55:20,298 --> 01:55:22,766
It's not mother's fault.

1749
01:55:24,293 --> 01:55:28,839
But mother, allow us to leave now.

1750
01:55:29,105 --> 01:55:30,632
No, no, Lalla.

1751

Why will you leave this house?

1752
01:55:34,745 --> 01:55:38,150
She will leave, forever.

1753
01:55:39,368 --> 01:55:42,840
She won't leave till she's alive, mother.

1754
01:55:44,110 --> 01:55:47,285
If you want to get rid of her forever...

1755
01:55:48,952 --> 01:55:51,633
...you'll have to kill her.

1756

Mother, she's not a woman, but fire.

1757
01:55:57,972 --> 01:56:00,248
She'll incinerate the entire house.

1758
01:56:06,737 --> 01:56:08,587
What should I do now?

1759
01:56:14,723 --> 01:56:16,209
No need to worry.

1760
01:56:16,303 --> 01:56:17,570
The girl is fine now.

1761
01:56:17,763 --> 01:56:20,338
- Sister, remove the saline.
- Yes, doctor.

1762
01:56:20,432 --> 01:56:23,226
Come will me.
I'll prescribe the medicines.

1763
01:56:28,692 --> 01:56:32,567
Durga, today Veena is
alive because of you.

1764
01:56:33,612 --> 01:56:37,843
I had no courage to face
mother even at such a moment.

1765
01:56:38,475 --> 01:56:41,370
Sister, you'll get the courage some day.

1766
01:56:42,326 --> 01:56:43,839
When elders do atrocities...

1767
01:56:44,373 --> 01:56:47,028
...youngsters are forced to confront them.

- Lizard's poison!
- Oh God!

01:57:53,009 --> 01:57:55,273
- Natural death!
- Oh dear!

1776
01:57:55,835 --> 01:57:57,613
Is it necessary to kill her?

1777
01:57:58,837 --> 01:58:01,535
Isn't there any other way to
drive her out of the house?

1778
01:58:01,764 --> 01:58:03,145
No, mother.

1779

Poison is the antidote for poison.

Today she has slapped me.

1781
01:58:13,005 --> 01:58:19,602
I fear she might slap you too in future.

Okay.

Put it in, mother. Don't delay.

1787
01:59:01,511 --> 01:59:02,559
Or she might come in.

1788

You did the right thing.

1796
01:59:41,948 --> 01:59:45,541
I scolded you a lot in
my anger at that time.

1797
01:59:45,635 --> 01:59:49,092
Even Lalla repented a lot later on. Yes.

I'm not hungry today.

Why aren't you hungry?
You shouldn't sleep hungry.

1807
02:00:17,710 --> 02:00:21,040
Eat something. Then go to sleep.

- I don't know, mom.
- Let it be. We found them in the house.

- Yes. If you doubt, you can check it.

But I don't think Durga is such a girl.

2080
02:18:20,359 --> 02:18:24,649
Mother, if you bequeath your wealth...

2081
02:18:25,471 --> 02:18:27,971
...to someone else...

2082
02:18:29,911 --> 02:18:32,247
...nobody can kill you.

2083
02:18:34,812 --> 02:18:35,877
Yes.

2084
02:18:36,549 --> 02:18:38,433
Then what will they get by killing me?

2085
02:18:39,691 --> 02:18:42,214
I'll ask the lawyer to make a will.

2086
02:18:42,472 --> 02:18:46,776
And I'll bequeath you all my property.
That's it.

2087
02:18:51,834 --> 02:18:53,885
The will is ready, madam Bhavani.

2088
02:18:57,171 --> 02:18:58,112
Take this.

2089
02:18:58,562 --> 02:19:00,745
- Sign here.
- Okay.

2090
02:19:10,124 --> 02:19:14,078
I hand you the responsibility
of the house from today, Lalla.

2091
02:19:16,712 --> 02:19:21,079
Now see, mother.
I will teach every one nice lesson.

2092
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:31,314
Why are you so depressed?

2093
02:19:31,650 --> 02:19:33,174
Won't you go to work?

2094
02:19:34,436 --> 02:19:36,226
Nothing is left there for us now.

2095
02:19:37,545 --> 02:19:39,818
Mother has willed
everything to Khopchand.

2096
02:19:41,029 --> 02:19:42,856
She made us his slave.

2097
02:19:44,145 --> 02:19:45,290
Everything will be fine.

2098
02:19:45,384 --> 02:19:46,982
Brother-in-law!

2099
02:19:54,957 --> 02:19:57,472
You didn't go to work today.

2100
02:19:58,862 --> 02:20:01,501
It's fine if you don't want to go.

2101
02:20:02,100 --> 02:20:03,609
You're on leave today.

2102
02:20:06,723 --> 02:20:09,227
But brother-in-law, I'm going to bank.

2103
02:20:09,988 --> 02:20:13,180
Polish my shoes.

2104
02:20:15,269 --> 02:20:17,435
Is my dad your servant?

2105
02:20:17,706 --> 02:20:19,890
Why will he polish your shoes?

2106
02:20:19,984 --> 02:20:21,278
Wow!

2107
02:20:22,311 --> 02:20:25,315
Father is too timid to say anything.

2108
02:20:25,734 --> 02:20:27,759
But this small kid is yelling!

2109
02:20:28,013 --> 02:20:30,008
Beware! Leave my kid.

2110
02:20:30,569 --> 02:20:34,589
Then tell your husband
to polish my shoes.

2111
02:20:34,683 --> 02:20:35,661
What?

2112
02:20:36,847 --> 02:20:38,646
He'll polish your shoes.

2113
02:20:38,978 --> 02:20:40,450
Who else will do it?

2114
02:20:40,980 --> 02:20:43,911
I've fired Sukhlal.

2115
02:20:44,005 --> 02:20:45,374
Yes, madam.

2116
02:20:45,795 --> 02:20:49,656
Now you'll have to do
all the house chores.

2117
02:20:50,068 --> 02:20:52,792
Khopchand, mind your tongue.

2118
02:20:53,705 --> 02:20:55,401
I'll do that.

2119
02:20:57,099 --> 02:20:58,807
You take my shoes.

2120
02:20:59,519 --> 02:21:01,515
- Polish it.
- Scum!

2121
02:21:01,697 --> 02:21:03,986
You! What's going on?

2122
02:21:04,194 --> 02:21:06,095
You've raised your hand on Lalla.

2123
02:21:06,390 --> 02:21:10,213
Mother, cancel your will and let me go.

2124
02:21:10,307 --> 02:21:11,985
No, no, Lalla.

2125
02:21:12,279 --> 02:21:15,344
I've willed everything
to you after deliberation.

2126
02:21:16,401 --> 02:21:17,341
Mahesh!

2127
02:21:18,004 --> 02:21:20,338
You'll have to listen to Lalla.

2128
02:21:20,432 --> 02:21:22,809
Why don't you say that
I'll have to obey him?

2129
02:21:23,137 --> 02:21:25,578
Yes, you'll have to obey him.

2130
02:21:25,847 --> 02:21:27,869
We won't live here to obey him.

2131
02:21:28,392 --> 02:21:29,482
Come on, Veena.

2132
02:21:30,671 --> 02:21:32,659
Yes. Come, Sheila.
We can't live here now.

2133
02:21:32,753 --> 02:21:33,915
Where are you going?

2134
02:21:34,009 --> 02:21:37,828
Out of this prison
to breathe in fresh air.

2135
02:21:38,090 --> 02:21:40,078
You don't have to go.

2136
02:21:40,632 --> 02:21:42,635
Lalla never says anything wrong.

2137
02:21:42,974 --> 02:21:45,825
No, he is always right.

2138
02:21:46,345 --> 02:21:48,077
Even you are always right.

2139
02:21:48,884 --> 02:21:53,082
I always saw injustice
done on my wife but...

2140
02:21:53,977 --> 02:21:55,415
...I never said a word.

2141
02:21:55,906 --> 02:21:57,102
Enough.

2142
02:21:57,409 --> 02:21:59,699
That's it. I can't keep quiet anymore.

2143
02:22:00,444 --> 02:22:01,549
Come, Sheila.

2144
02:22:02,230 --> 02:22:03,409
Wait.

2145
02:22:04,442 --> 02:22:05,945
You can't go.

2146
02:22:06,507 --> 02:22:09,359
- Move aside, mother. Let us go.
- Shut up!

2147
02:22:10,313 --> 02:22:12,070
You back answer me.

2148
02:22:12,615 --> 02:22:14,915
Let me see how to step out of this house.

2149
02:22:15,710 --> 02:22:18,420
You've lost the right to order me,
mother.

2150
02:22:18,936 --> 02:22:22,758
The leg, which you had
burnt, has got strength now.

2151
02:22:23,381 --> 02:22:24,760
Now it won't stumble.

2152
02:22:26,947 --> 02:22:28,324
How dare you!

2153
02:22:50,876 --> 02:22:53,463
Sir, come with me.

2154
02:22:53,812 --> 02:22:55,350
My house is your house too.

2155
02:22:55,599 --> 02:22:58,799
- Uncle Sukhlal.
- Listen. Don't refuse, madam.

2156
02:22:58,975 --> 02:22:59,974
Come, child.

2157
02:23:00,351 --> 02:23:01,651
Come, sir.

2158
02:23:10,309 --> 02:23:12,516
Who are you? What do you want?

2159
02:23:13,047 --> 02:23:15,716
- You're the broker of jewellery market.
- What's the matter?

2160
02:23:16,445 --> 02:23:19,024
You know, you had brought
the necklace in the mansion?

2161
02:23:19,333 --> 02:23:20,336
Necklace?

2162
02:23:21,039 --> 02:23:21,913
Which necklace?

2163
02:23:22,007 --> 02:23:22,858
- Don't know.
- No.

2164
02:23:22,951 --> 02:23:25,059
Sir, he doesn't remember the necklace.

2165
02:23:25,153 --> 02:23:26,255
- No?
- No.

2166
02:23:27,086 --> 02:23:29,259
Poor fellow got hurt.

2167
02:23:31,919 --> 02:23:33,575
You don't know? Now?

2168
02:23:35,043 --> 02:23:36,239
No. I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

2169
02:23:36,332 --> 02:23:38,109
Khopchand gave me that necklace.

2170
02:23:38,203 --> 02:23:39,128
- Really?
- Yes.

2171
02:23:39,222 --> 02:23:41,256
- Rest of the jewelleries?
- Other jewelleries?

2172
02:23:41,516 --> 02:23:42,362
Which one?

2173
02:23:42,456 --> 02:23:43,346
- You don't know?
- No.

2174
02:23:44,028 --> 02:23:46,801
- You don't know?
- Yes.

2175
02:23:49,979 --> 02:23:51,360
Tell me.

2176
02:23:52,963 --> 02:23:54,201
Wait. I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

2177
02:23:54,295 --> 02:23:55,881
I'll tell you. That...

2178
02:23:55,975 --> 02:24:00,005
Khopchand gave those
jewelleries to Kesar.

2179
02:24:15,349 --> 02:24:16,989
Listen, brother.

2180
02:24:21,067 --> 02:24:23,814
I am not brother, but Patanga.

2181
02:24:24,726 --> 02:24:28,072
- Tell me.
- No, it's nothing.

2182
02:24:28,277 --> 02:24:30,196
I wanted to meet someone else.

2183
02:24:30,291 --> 02:24:31,299
Listen.

2184
02:24:32,210 --> 02:24:33,726
Can't I help you?

2185
02:24:34,039 --> 02:24:35,968
No, brother. I mean sister.

2186
02:24:36,062 --> 02:24:37,400
I mean sister-in-law.

2187
02:24:37,993 --> 02:24:40,736
- What can I say?
- Tell me, what do you want?

2188
02:24:40,995 --> 02:24:42,138
Don't feel shy.

2189
02:24:42,614 --> 02:24:45,251
- Do you want to meet madam Kesar?
- Yes.

2190
02:24:45,940 --> 02:24:47,268
Do you know her?

2191
02:24:47,362 --> 02:24:48,486
Go. I won't tell you.

2192
02:24:48,884 --> 02:24:50,825
- Please tell me.
- I won't tell you.

2193
02:24:51,059 --> 02:24:53,305
Listen, if you help me meet her...

2194
02:24:53,399 --> 02:24:55,415
...I'll please you too.

2195
02:24:55,509 --> 02:24:56,841
- Really?
- Yes.

2196
02:24:56,935 --> 02:24:58,115
Really.

2197
02:24:59,259 --> 02:25:02,117
- From how far do you want to meet her?
- Far?

2198
02:25:02,732 --> 02:25:03,679
What do you mean?

2199
02:25:03,773 --> 02:25:05,999
20 rupees to see her
from 20 meter distance.

2200
02:25:06,378 --> 02:25:10,257
- Rs.50 to meet from so near.
- I will give you Rs.100.

2201
02:25:10,350 --> 02:25:13,393
- Bravo, dear!
- Help me!

2202
02:25:13,487 --> 02:25:15,114
- Totaram, what is going on?
- Help!

2203
02:25:15,411 --> 02:25:17,913
Help me! Help me! Sir. Sir.

2204
02:25:18,007 --> 02:25:22,462
He's Kesar's secretary.
He was frisking me.

2205
02:25:22,555 --> 02:25:24,118
- Kesar's secretary.
- Yes.

2206
02:25:24,212 --> 02:25:25,723
Oh God! 2 men.

2207
02:25:25,817 --> 02:25:28,622
You've to pay more money for 2 men.

2208
02:25:28,966 --> 02:25:31,051
More money! My foot!

2209
02:25:31,256 --> 02:25:32,399
Do you know him?

2210
02:25:32,700 --> 02:25:35,818
- Who are you?
- CID.

2211
02:25:36,410 --> 02:25:38,007
CID. Oh God!

2212
02:25:38,646 --> 02:25:41,495
- Crime branch.
- Crime branch? Oh God! I'm stuck.

2213
02:25:41,589 --> 02:25:42,902
Take your money back. Bye.

2214
02:25:42,996 --> 02:25:45,331
Where are you going, queen?

2215
02:25:45,425 --> 02:25:48,015
- Won't you take us to madam Kesar?
- No. I don't know.

2216
02:25:48,109 --> 02:25:49,155
- Do you know?
- No.

2217
02:25:49,249 --> 02:25:50,358
- Do you?
- Yes.

2218
02:25:50,452 --> 02:25:52,192
- Then come on.
- Why are you manhandling me?

2219
02:25:52,286 --> 02:25:54,845
- Come. - Oh God! Leave me.
You are two and I'm alone.

2220
02:25:55,243 --> 02:25:57,557
Khopchand. Who is Khopchand?

2221
02:25:58,373 --> 02:25:59,816
I don't know, sir.

2222
02:26:00,266 --> 02:26:01,432
Listen, madam Kesar.

2223
02:26:01,670 --> 02:26:04,302
Our men have surrounded this house.

2224
02:26:05,644 --> 02:26:09,838
- If you don't tell us about
the jewelleries... - Okay. Okay.

2225
02:26:10,032 --> 02:26:12,626
- Those jewelleries?
- Yes. Yes. Those jewelleries.

2226
02:26:12,720 --> 02:26:14,768
But Khopchand has taken them back.

2227
02:26:15,030 --> 02:26:16,850
Sister, they're CID.

2228
02:26:16,944 --> 02:26:18,055
Listen, madam Kesar.

2229
02:26:18,541 --> 02:26:21,062
If you try to act smart with us...

2230
02:26:21,156 --> 02:26:23,342
...you'll rot in prison for all your life.

2231
02:26:24,186 --> 02:26:26,209
- Totaram. Handcuff her.
- Okay.

2232
02:26:26,302 --> 02:26:28,633
No, no, sir. I'll tell you.

2233
02:26:28,727 --> 02:26:31,196
But sir, I hope we won't
get in any trouble.

2234
02:26:31,810 --> 02:26:33,176
We're poor.

2235
02:26:33,452 --> 02:26:36,321
If you help us, we'll save you.

2236
02:26:37,073 --> 02:26:38,849
- I've the jewelleries.
- Good.

2237
02:26:39,452 --> 02:26:40,568
I will get them.

2238
02:26:40,987 --> 02:26:41,987
- Totaram.
- Yes?

2239
02:26:42,081 --> 02:26:43,182
Go inside with her.

2240
02:26:43,276 --> 02:26:45,638
Me? Thank you, sir.

2241
02:26:45,831 --> 02:26:47,079
Thank you.

2242
02:26:56,917 --> 02:26:57,803
Take this, sir.

2243
02:26:58,294 --> 02:27:00,326
But sir, take care of us.

2244
02:27:00,420 --> 02:27:02,787
We will. We always will.

2245
02:27:02,881 --> 02:27:05,631
- And forever.
- Totaram, come.

2246
02:27:05,986 --> 02:27:07,072
Yes, sir.

2247
02:27:07,481 --> 02:27:08,952
[FOOTSTEPS]

2248
02:27:12,760 --> 02:27:14,940
Give us the jewelleries.

2249
02:27:15,893 --> 02:27:18,418
Jewelleries? Okay.

2250
02:27:19,671 --> 02:27:22,179
Sir, give them the jewelleries.

2251
02:27:24,679 --> 02:27:25,982
Take it, brother.

2252
02:27:50,177 --> 02:27:51,179
