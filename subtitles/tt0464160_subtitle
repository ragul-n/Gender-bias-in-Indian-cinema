1
00:00:56,669 --> 00:00:58,296
Wait! Where are you running?

2
00:00:58,504 --> 00:00:59,300
Wait! I caught you.

3
00:00:59,672 --> 00:01:00,297
Give me my money.

4
00:01:00,506 --> 00:01:03,805
Since so many days
you have made us run after you.

5
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:05,306
Today give us our money.

6
00:01:05,511 --> 00:01:06,307
Then run all by your self alone!

7
00:01:06,679 --> 00:01:07,646
I will give you one tight slap.

8
00:01:07,847 --> 00:01:10,315
One second. One second.
Are you seeing this entire land?

9
00:01:10,516 --> 00:01:11,983
The entire land.
- Yes, we are seeing.

10
00:01:12,184 --> 00:01:14,652
Now just think that it is filled with
thousand mango trees.

11
00:01:14,854 --> 00:01:16,321
Close your eyes and imagine.
Close your eyes!

12
00:01:17,256 --> 00:01:19,190
You all keep your eyes open.
Or else he will run away.

13
00:01:19,358 --> 00:01:20,325
Only I will close my eyes.

14
00:01:20,526 --> 00:01:21,652
Yes, I closed them.
Now tell me, dear.

15
00:01:22,294 --> 00:01:24,990
How does it feel? - It is feeling nice.
Only trees are there all over.

16
00:01:25,531 --> 00:01:26,498
Even I thought of the same thing.

17
00:01:26,699 --> 00:01:27,927
That's why I bought the entire land...

18
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:29,498
...and even bought 1000 mango saplings.

19
00:01:29,702 --> 00:01:32,830
I thought as they grow they will
produce lakhs of mangoes.

20
00:01:33,038 --> 00:01:34,164
Because of which I will
become a billionaire...

21
00:01:34,373 --> 00:01:35,840
...and repay back your small debts.

22
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:36,837
How did you find it?

23
00:01:37,042 --> 00:01:39,010
Very good! It's a great idea.

24
00:01:39,211 --> 00:01:40,337
Even I thought it was a great idea.

25
00:01:40,546 --> 00:01:42,173
But the government thought of a
better idea than this.

26
00:01:42,381 --> 00:01:43,348
They want to lay a railway track here.

27
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:44,675
And they confiscated my land.

28
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,677
Now I have just 1000 mango saplings...

29
00:01:46,886 --> 00:01:48,183
...left with me which are rotting
along with my dreams.

30
00:01:48,387 --> 00:01:50,855
We are fed up listening to
your new stories.

31
00:01:51,056 --> 00:01:52,353
You changed so many businesses.

32
00:01:52,558 --> 00:01:54,355
And in all you had a loss.
So what should we do about it?

33
00:01:54,727 --> 00:01:56,695
You have even taken loans
from the cats and dogs.

34
00:01:56,896 --> 00:01:58,693
Now you will have to take a decision.
Now tell us.

35
00:01:58,898 --> 00:02:01,423
When are you giving the money?
- Tomorrow evening. 5 o'clock.

36
00:02:01,634 --> 00:02:04,034
The bridge which is next to the river.
All of you come there at 5 o'clock.

37
00:02:04,436 --> 00:02:05,698
5 o'clock, 7 o'clock, 10 o'clock!

38
00:02:05,905 --> 00:02:07,031
We have been hearing this
since many years.

39
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:09,036
Exactly that! We have a relation
since so many years.

40
00:02:09,241 --> 00:02:11,038
Don't you have any trust on me?
- No, no. Not at all.

41
00:02:11,744 --> 00:02:12,438
Leave all that.

42
00:02:12,745 --> 00:02:14,975
I am going to change the opinion
that you all have about me.

43
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:15,874
Tomorrow evening at 5 o'clock.

44
00:02:16,081 --> 00:02:17,878
I am going to repay back
all your debts together.

45
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:18,708
Really? - Lf you don't then?

46
00:02:18,918 --> 00:02:20,385
If I don't then do as you feel like.

47
00:02:20,586 --> 00:02:21,211
But sharp 5 o'clock.

48
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,388
If you don't come on time then
I am not going to wait.

49
00:02:23,589 --> 00:02:24,715
Then later don't tell me that
you didn't get your money.

50
00:02:24,924 --> 00:02:26,221
Fine. - Fine.

51
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:38,896
Come, welcome.

52
00:02:39,271 --> 00:02:40,670
I welcome all of you.

53
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,569
Very good! I said 5 o'clock.
You all have come sharp at 5 o'clock.

54
00:02:44,944 --> 00:02:46,912
Who says that the people over here
don't come on time?

55
00:02:48,213 --> 00:02:50,078
Move! One minute. Move.

56
00:02:51,283 --> 00:02:52,250
Has he started giving the money?

57
00:02:52,451 --> 00:02:55,079
Listen! Don't worry.
The program has just started.

58
00:02:55,788 --> 00:02:58,256
So everyone has come?
- Yes, we have come.

59
00:02:58,457 --> 00:03:01,426
I will do one thing. I will read
everyone's name one by one.

60
00:03:01,627 --> 00:03:02,685
Whosever's name I read, that one must...

61
00:03:02,895 --> 00:03:04,089
...raise their hand and
say that he is present.

62
00:03:04,296 --> 00:03:06,093
Okay? - Yes. - Yes. - Very good.

63
00:03:06,966 --> 00:03:10,265
Hariram Navid. 12,250 rupees.
- Present.

64
00:03:11,971 --> 00:03:14,769
Prabhakar Shetty. Along with interest
it is 13,900 rupees.

65
00:03:15,074 --> 00:03:17,440
Present! - How are you, dear?
- I am fine.

66
00:03:17,643 --> 00:03:20,612
Raghuveer Gwala. 20,500 rupees.
- Present.

67
00:03:20,813 --> 00:03:23,373
How is everyone at home?
- Yes, they are fine. - Okay.

68
00:03:23,649 --> 00:03:27,779
Oye! First pay me my money
and let me go.

69
00:03:28,153 --> 00:03:29,450
Hey! Sharma-ji.

70
00:03:29,822 --> 00:03:32,450
I have to give you a lot of money.
And he himself has come late.

71
00:03:32,658 --> 00:03:35,627
Now don't delay. Give me my money.
- Be calm! Be calm!

72
00:03:35,828 --> 00:03:37,625
See, along with Sharma-ji's money...

73
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,798
...I have to give all of you a
total of 13,90,000 rupees.

74
00:03:41,834 --> 00:03:44,632
I don't have so much with me.
I am falling a little short.

75
00:03:44,837 --> 00:03:45,735
How much are you falling short?

76
00:03:46,405 --> 00:03:47,804
Not much. I am falling short
just a little bit.

77
00:03:48,007 --> 00:03:49,133
Even then. How much?

78
00:03:51,343 --> 00:03:53,811
100 rupees. - Doesn't matter.
Doesn't matter. - No, no.

79
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,477
I just have 100 rupees with me.

80
00:03:56,682 --> 00:03:58,809
I am falling short by 13,89,900 rupees.

81
00:03:59,018 --> 00:04:02,476
Take the money out! - Listen!

82
00:04:02,855 --> 00:04:04,982
Don't touch this. - What is in this?

83
00:04:06,258 --> 00:04:08,818
Rat poison. - Rat poison!

84
00:04:09,862 --> 00:04:12,831
Actually the thing is that I don't have...

85
00:04:13,032 --> 00:04:15,500
...that much money to buy cyanide so...
I was roaming with this.

86
00:04:16,201 --> 00:04:17,668
Who knows when the need of this arises?

87
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,838
Throw the bottle! - Throw the bottle!

88
00:04:22,107 --> 00:04:24,166
I knew that you all wouldn't even
let me die in peace.

89
00:04:26,645 --> 00:04:28,670
Even then I have no complaints
about all of you.

90
00:04:29,982 --> 00:04:31,950
You all have helped me at some point
of time or the other.

91
00:04:33,052 --> 00:04:34,576
But I won't betray you all.

92
00:04:35,254 --> 00:04:36,778
I will return you all every penny back.

93
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:39,188
What to do?

94
00:04:40,392 --> 00:04:44,192
Whatever business I started it all doomed.

95
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,857
At the end I opened a firecracker factory.

96
00:04:47,566 --> 00:04:48,533
Even that went bust.

97
00:04:48,734 --> 00:04:51,862
Then sell those firecrackers and
repay the debts of all of us.

98
00:04:52,071 --> 00:04:55,700
Hey! What I meant was that the
firecrackers didn't work.

99
00:04:55,908 --> 00:04:57,034
Then from where should
I give you your money?

100
00:05:00,012 --> 00:05:01,309
My father used to say that my name would...

101
00:05:02,181 --> 00:05:04,706
...definitely come in the
Guinness Book of World Records.

102
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:06,816
He was right.

103
00:05:08,287 --> 00:05:10,551
There wouldn't be anyone in the
world apart from me who...

104
00:05:10,756 --> 00:05:12,553
...is so young and has taken such a
huge amount of loan.

105
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,624
But I didn't do all this on purpose.

106
00:05:16,929 --> 00:05:18,055
The situations were such.

107
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:22,064
Now I have only 2 options.

108
00:05:24,803 --> 00:05:26,828
Either you all give me 5 years time.

109
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,574
Or I will have to jump
into the ocean and die.

110
00:05:32,111 --> 00:05:34,739
Hey! Don't try to act
over smart with me!

111
00:05:34,947 --> 00:05:36,574
If you die by jumping
in the ocean then...

112
00:05:36,782 --> 00:05:38,409
...I am happily willing to let go of my money.

113
00:05:38,617 --> 00:05:40,346
If you have so much guts
then jump into the ocean.

114
00:05:40,686 --> 00:05:41,482
I will jump!

115
00:05:42,454 --> 00:05:44,922
I have taken a huge amount of
insurance policy on my name.

116
00:05:45,858 --> 00:05:47,758
And you all will get your
money back from that.

117
00:05:48,794 --> 00:05:50,853
But I need some help of you all in it.

118
00:05:51,797 --> 00:05:53,094
Tell the insurance agents
that my death...

119
00:05:53,465 --> 00:05:55,933
...was just an accident
it wasn't suicide.

120
00:05:56,802 --> 00:06:00,431
While I was talking to you all my leg
slipped and I fell into the water.

121
00:06:01,406 --> 00:06:04,432
As soon as we get the money
my father will pay you all back the money.

122
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:07,278
Hey dude! Stop talking
about these futile things!

123
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:08,446
And talk something about
giving our money back.

124
00:06:08,647 --> 00:06:09,272
Yes!

125
00:06:10,048 --> 00:06:11,606
This is his new trick. New trick!

126
00:06:11,817 --> 00:06:14,012
Dear Jeetu, don't play this game with us.

127
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,344
I just have this game with me.

128
00:06:17,723 --> 00:06:19,691
Its not that I don't want to live.

129
00:06:20,993 --> 00:06:22,620
But there is no other option left.

130
00:06:23,996 --> 00:06:27,693
Those people who know me closely,
they will understand.

131
00:06:28,734 --> 00:06:30,224
That my decision was not wrong.

132
00:06:39,678 --> 00:06:43,136
Hey! He really got drowned!

133
00:07:02,801 --> 00:07:04,826
Did we get any information
from the guard? - No.

134
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,665
What happened? Did you get the body?
- No, inspector.

135
00:07:10,442 --> 00:07:11,670
Did you look for it properly?

136
00:07:20,652 --> 00:07:23,280
Father, someone has come to meet you.

137
00:07:30,896 --> 00:07:31,624
Tell me.

138
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:35,197
Sir, we haven't come to meet you
but Jeetu-ji.

139
00:07:36,902 --> 00:07:39,029
Jeetu. Jeetu!

140
00:07:43,075 --> 00:07:44,201
Yes, father.

141
00:07:44,743 --> 00:07:46,870
They are saying that they have
come to meet you.

142
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:49,809
Yes, I know you.

143
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,880
But why have they come to
meet me, father?

144
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:55,049
I know why they have come.
- Yes, even I know.

145
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,787
I thought before meeting me
they should see you once.

146
00:07:59,591 --> 00:08:00,216
Why?

147
00:08:00,926 --> 00:08:02,723
Am I a monkey that I will
show them some act?

148
00:08:02,928 --> 00:08:04,555
So anyone who comes first must see me.

149
00:08:05,697 --> 00:08:07,722
Father, you don't know him?

150
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,567
Baban Rao... the vegetable guy.

151
00:08:09,768 --> 00:08:11,565
Do you remember the lottery business
I had started...

152
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,135
Yes, the one that had
gone into losses.

153
00:08:13,605 --> 00:08:17,166
So... he only had helped me in
returning back the bank loan.

154
00:08:17,609 --> 00:08:20,407
Along with the money and interest
the total comes up to 40,000 rupees.

155
00:08:20,712 --> 00:08:21,906
I am fed up telling him.

156
00:08:22,114 --> 00:08:24,742
That I will pay him tomorrow.
I will pay him tomorrow.

157
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,577
Even then he doesn't believe me.

158
00:08:27,452 --> 00:08:28,919
You don't have to give me
him any money.

159
00:08:29,488 --> 00:08:31,251
You just have to give him
a date for that.

160
00:08:31,456 --> 00:08:32,423
He will agree to it.
He will agree.

161
00:08:32,691 --> 00:08:33,487
You are right.

162
00:08:34,626 --> 00:08:38,426
To give people a date and
not to meet them on that date.

163
00:08:39,231 --> 00:08:41,028
I don't have this talent,
which you have, dear.

164
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,494
Even he knows that, father.

165
00:08:42,701 --> 00:08:43,258
That's why he was saying that only...

166
00:08:43,468 --> 00:08:44,935
...when you give a date then
he will agree.

167
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:49,270
Please, help me, father.
Or else I will have to get myself hanged.

168
00:08:55,647 --> 00:08:56,113
Yes, dear ones!

169
00:08:56,315 --> 00:08:58,783
They are not giving you a date.
He is paying you the entire money.

170
00:09:00,585 --> 00:09:01,552
Take this rope.

171
00:09:02,421 --> 00:09:04,787
Tie it around your neck
and hang yourself.

172
00:09:06,091 --> 00:09:08,059
Your elder sister is sitting
in the house unwed.

173
00:09:08,994 --> 00:09:12,452
This house is only left which we had to
mortgage because of you.

174
00:09:12,664 --> 00:09:14,131
And you want more help from me.

175
00:09:14,499 --> 00:09:15,796
What will I help you?

176
00:09:16,268 --> 00:09:17,735
Go and drown somewhere so that...

177
00:09:18,003 --> 00:09:19,129
...we can save ourselves from more ruin.

178
00:09:19,338 --> 00:09:19,963
Go!

179
00:09:27,913 --> 00:09:29,642
See, the decision that we had taken...

180
00:09:29,848 --> 00:09:32,544
...don't use that to ruin
my daughter's life.

181
00:09:33,185 --> 00:09:34,311
What are you talking?

182
00:09:34,853 --> 00:09:36,320
Have I ever interfered
in your path till date?

183
00:09:37,022 --> 00:09:37,818
You do one thing.

184
00:09:38,357 --> 00:09:39,824
You find a good boy for Pooja and...

185
00:09:40,192 --> 00:09:41,659
...get her married with
great pomp and show.

186
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,487
And I will be the first one
in that to help you.

187
00:09:44,196 --> 00:09:46,494
Are you happy?
- Only if she agrees to it!

188
00:09:46,865 --> 00:09:48,662
Since years she is stubborn
about one thing.

189
00:09:48,867 --> 00:09:50,334
That she wants to get
married to you only.

190
00:09:50,869 --> 00:09:51,995
Why are you cursing her?

191
00:09:53,038 --> 00:09:54,164
Since the time she has come to her...

192
00:09:54,373 --> 00:09:57,001
...senses you have been
hearing one thing.

193
00:09:57,209 --> 00:09:57,675
That we are made for each other.

194
00:09:57,876 --> 00:10:00,674
I agree that we also
wanted the same thing.

195
00:10:00,979 --> 00:10:03,504
But I didn't know that
you would grow up...

196
00:10:03,715 --> 00:10:05,512
...to become such a useless person.

197
00:10:06,818 --> 00:10:09,514
You find a groom for her.
I will handle the rest.

198
00:10:10,922 --> 00:10:12,685
I won't be able to bear the pain of
separation from her.

199
00:10:13,258 --> 00:10:14,919
But at least she will live in peace.

200
00:10:15,127 --> 00:10:16,526
She won't agree.

201
00:10:16,728 --> 00:10:19,196
Till the time you are in front of her...

202
00:10:19,398 --> 00:10:21,958
...she will never agree to
marry someone else.

203
00:10:22,167 --> 00:10:22,633
Understood?

204
00:10:22,834 --> 00:10:24,699
That's why I am saying that run away.

205
00:10:24,903 --> 00:10:25,870
Go away to some far of place.

206
00:10:26,071 --> 00:10:27,698
And return after years.

207
00:10:27,973 --> 00:10:29,531
And even if you don't come back
then also it will do.

208
00:10:30,242 --> 00:10:33,370
Actually the thing is that you can
get rid of your moneylenders...

209
00:10:33,578 --> 00:10:35,546
...and I will get my daughter married
somewhere else.

210
00:10:35,747 --> 00:10:36,543
Understood?

211
00:10:36,748 --> 00:10:39,046
Now don't say that you don't
have money to go.

212
00:10:39,251 --> 00:10:40,718
Take this! Take this money!

213
00:10:41,253 --> 00:10:42,220
Keep it!

214
00:10:42,754 --> 00:10:45,382
And don't come back with the
excuse to return this.

215
00:11:05,877 --> 00:11:08,175
How did you come with this rally?

216
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,671
Have you left everything and
got into politics?

217
00:11:10,882 --> 00:11:13,248
It's not politics. I had to save myself
from the moneylenders.

218
00:11:13,452 --> 00:11:16,182
When I participate in the rally then
the moneylenders can't catch me.

219
00:11:16,455 --> 00:11:18,582
When in the morning I came out then
I got the rally of BJP.

220
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,417
Then I reached the post office
by walking with them.

221
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:21,091
After reaching over there
I got to know...

222
00:11:21,293 --> 00:11:22,419
...they wanted to go left and
I wanted to go right.

223
00:11:22,627 --> 00:11:23,252
Then I escaped.

224
00:11:23,795 --> 00:11:25,763
After waiting for such a long time
I caught hold of this congress rally.

225
00:11:25,964 --> 00:11:27,090
Then I could come to meet you.

226
00:11:27,466 --> 00:11:28,330
Oh God!

227
00:11:28,733 --> 00:11:31,258
Sometimes you become a part of this rally
and sometime the other rally?

228
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,599
Don't these rally people tell you anything?

229
00:11:34,072 --> 00:11:34,766
They tell me.

230
00:11:34,973 --> 00:11:36,770
Whatever they say I speak the same thing.

231
00:11:36,975 --> 00:11:38,272
I am fed up with you.

232
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,778
Leave all that. Come here, with me.

233
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,952
Don't talk rubbish!

234
00:11:52,491 --> 00:11:55,119
Have I ever troubled you
with the topic of marriage?

235
00:11:56,428 --> 00:12:01,024
Until all your tensions are not over
I am willing to wait for you.

236
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,225
Till when?
- Let it take whatever time.

237
00:12:04,736 --> 00:12:05,896
Let anything happen.

238
00:12:06,738 --> 00:12:08,638
We will at least live
together one day.

239
00:12:09,174 --> 00:12:11,472
That's all.
That is enough for me.

240
00:12:12,844 --> 00:12:14,141
This cannot happen, Pooja.

241
00:12:15,247 --> 00:12:17,647
I have a lot of burden of
loan over me.

242
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,817
I can't even handle the
weight of an ant.

243
00:12:20,785 --> 00:12:21,877
And if you really ask me...

244
00:12:22,587 --> 00:12:24,418
...even you are a burden for me now.

245
00:12:25,857 --> 00:12:27,256
We will have to separate, Pooja.

246
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:31,154
Now you go home.

247
00:12:31,363 --> 00:12:32,830
If this rally passes by then there is no...

248
00:12:33,031 --> 00:12:34,658
...rally till the evening
that will make me reach home.

249
00:12:59,658 --> 00:13:02,183
Have you ever even got groceries
for a week for this house?

250
00:13:02,394 --> 00:13:04,089
Now father can't tell this to me, mother.

251
00:13:04,462 --> 00:13:04,951
Take this.

252
00:13:05,163 --> 00:13:07,427
This is one week's grocery and
vegetables to cook along with it.

253
00:13:09,734 --> 00:13:11,031
Have you got fish?

254
00:13:11,303 --> 00:13:12,031
What are you saying, mother?

255
00:13:12,237 --> 00:13:14,034
Don't I know that fish is
not cooked in this house?

256
00:13:14,406 --> 00:13:15,703
Then this stink of fish?

257
00:13:15,907 --> 00:13:18,205
Yes... I was going through
the fish market.

258
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,708
So over there people carry
fish in the containers.

259
00:13:20,912 --> 00:13:22,539
So even I picked up a few.

260
00:13:22,747 --> 00:13:24,044
Just like that.
Just for a change.

261
00:13:24,316 --> 00:13:25,874
Dear, you are doing all this...

262
00:13:26,084 --> 00:13:27,551
As if I am going to do all
this work every day?

263
00:13:27,752 --> 00:13:29,720
You cook the meal. I will have
a shower and come quickly.

264
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,823
Mother, aren't you eating food?
- I will have it later.

265
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:41,055
This won't do! I have put in
so much of hard work.

266
00:13:41,266 --> 00:13:44,235
You will have to have one morsel
from my hands.

267
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:54,745
What has happened to you, dear?

268
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,246
Mother, I had promised you
a lot of things, right?

269
00:13:59,217 --> 00:14:02,482
Big house. New car. Servants.

270
00:14:03,788 --> 00:14:05,016
Is everything ready?

271
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:10,926
Now I feel I won't be able to
give you anything, mother. Never.

272
00:14:13,231 --> 00:14:14,755
I don't want anything.

273
00:14:15,567 --> 00:14:17,762
I can't bear to see all that you do...

274
00:14:17,969 --> 00:14:22,599
...to get rid of the moneylenders.

275
00:14:25,076 --> 00:14:26,270
You don't worry.

276
00:14:27,479 --> 00:14:28,946
I have a way to solve it.

277
00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:32,310
After that no one will run after me.

278
00:14:32,517 --> 00:14:34,451
Is it? What is it?

279
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,447
When it happens, you will
get to know it on your own.

280
00:14:38,657 --> 00:14:40,284
Maybe you might first feel hurt.

281
00:14:41,826 --> 00:14:43,794
But never abuse or curse me.

282
00:14:45,997 --> 00:14:47,794
And after fathers temper cools down...

283
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:52,633
...then tell him that
Jeetu wasn't a bad boy.

284
00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:58,469
Whatever he did,
he didn't do it on purpose.

285
00:15:00,445 --> 00:15:03,812
And definitely tell him this
that I loved him a lot.

286
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:07,111
Those people who had gone to look...

287
00:15:07,185 --> 00:15:08,311
...for the body they have
all come back.

288
00:15:08,787 --> 00:15:10,982
The current is very strong today.

289
00:15:11,189 --> 00:15:12,656
There are few chances of
finding the body.

290
00:15:13,024 --> 00:15:14,423
Take Master-ji home.

291
00:15:41,886 --> 00:15:43,854
These eyes and the kohl.

292
00:15:44,055 --> 00:15:46,353
This bindi and this veil.

293
00:15:46,558 --> 00:15:50,858
Why do they make me so restless?

294
00:15:51,229 --> 00:15:57,862
Why does... my heart...
love you only so much?

295
00:15:58,236 --> 00:16:11,673
Why does... my heart...
love you only so much?

296
00:16:11,816 --> 00:16:14,284
From the blooming mornings.

297
00:16:14,452 --> 00:16:16,545
From the fading evenings.

298
00:16:16,755 --> 00:16:21,317
From my own people and
from strangers.

299
00:16:21,526 --> 00:16:26,225
Why do I ask this again and again?

300
00:16:26,498 --> 00:16:33,563
Why does... my heart...
love you only so much?

301
00:16:52,624 --> 00:16:54,922
My day and nights are there
only because of you.

302
00:16:55,126 --> 00:17:00,689
The days and nights... the days and nights...
the days and nights.

303
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:03,094
I am nothing without you.

304
00:17:03,301 --> 00:17:07,931
Without you... without you...
without you.

305
00:17:08,807 --> 00:17:11,002
This feeling is so deep.

306
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:13,436
These boundaries of desires.

307
00:17:13,645 --> 00:17:18,275
Why do they make me so restless?

308
00:17:18,483 --> 00:17:31,954
Why does... my heart...
love you only so much?

309
00:17:32,163 --> 00:17:34,290
From the blooming mornings.

310
00:17:34,499 --> 00:17:36,558
From the fading evenings.

311
00:17:36,835 --> 00:17:41,397
From my own people and
from strangers.

312
00:17:41,606 --> 00:17:46,373
Why do I ask this again and again?

313
00:17:46,578 --> 00:18:15,864
Why does... my heart...
love you only so much?

314
00:18:54,245 --> 00:18:57,305
Hey Raju, go and find that Gundya out!

315
00:18:59,417 --> 00:19:01,544
See there. That Gujarati
in the moustache.

316
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,388
But what is he doing here
in a minister's attire.

317
00:19:04,622 --> 00:19:06,055
He must have come to buy fish.

318
00:19:08,259 --> 00:19:09,385
Whether the moustache is on the
face or the face is on the moustache.

319
00:19:09,594 --> 00:19:10,720
This can't be figured out only!

320
00:19:11,429 --> 00:19:12,555
Hey, you fool!

321
00:19:13,431 --> 00:19:16,229
This moustache has nothing
to do with you!

322
00:19:16,434 --> 00:19:17,731
He knows Hindi.

323
00:19:17,936 --> 00:19:19,403
Hey! You guys don't know him? - No.

324
00:19:19,637 --> 00:19:20,569
He is Prabhat Singh Chauhan.

325
00:19:20,772 --> 00:19:22,069
Who are these people?
And what are they doing here?

326
00:19:22,273 --> 00:19:23,900
Sir, they are new.
They have come just now.

327
00:19:24,108 --> 00:19:25,075
That's why they don't know you.

328
00:19:25,276 --> 00:19:26,903
So what if we are from Gujarat?

329
00:19:27,278 --> 00:19:30,247
We are not whiling away our time
since 2 generations in Calcutta.

330
00:19:30,949 --> 00:19:31,574
What are you talking about Hindi?

331
00:19:31,783 --> 00:19:33,910
I can speak better Bengali also.

332
00:19:34,452 --> 00:19:36,579
Have you heard Tagore's verses?

333
00:19:36,788 --> 00:19:38,585
No, we haven't heard that.

334
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:41,418
But we have only heard
the abuses from the mouth...

335
00:19:41,626 --> 00:19:43,753
of our father after he gets
drunk in the evening.

336
00:19:46,631 --> 00:19:48,428
It is futile to talk with you all.

337
00:19:48,633 --> 00:19:50,430
Tell me has anyone of you seen that...

338
00:19:50,635 --> 00:19:51,761
...person Gundya who takes money on loan?

339
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,938
Hasn't he returned your money till now?

340
00:19:54,138 --> 00:19:57,266
If I spot him now then
I will burn him alive.

341
00:19:57,675 --> 00:19:58,937
He must be somewhere here.

342
00:20:02,313 --> 00:20:03,439
Hey Raju!

343
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:21,962
Boss!

344
00:20:30,174 --> 00:20:30,970
Who is he?

345
00:20:31,676 --> 00:20:34,474
Fool! Can't you see that
a good guy is praying?

346
00:20:34,912 --> 00:20:35,970
Go and do your work.

347
00:20:36,247 --> 00:20:37,145
Hey!

348
00:20:37,348 --> 00:20:41,478
See that! Today Gundya brother's boat
is coming first.

349
00:20:42,353 --> 00:20:43,820
My boat?

350
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:47,817
Oh! So you are here.

351
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:51,487
I thought a good guy is
sitting here and praying.

352
00:20:51,696 --> 00:20:53,823
Get up! You scoundrel! You betrayer!

353
00:20:54,065 --> 00:20:56,659
My boat is coming.
- I know that your boat is coming.

354
00:20:56,868 --> 00:20:57,664
First give my money.

355
00:20:58,036 --> 00:20:59,162
See... see.

356
00:20:59,537 --> 00:21:02,836
You know that whoevers boat
comes first when it rains...

357
00:21:03,074 --> 00:21:05,508
...he gets 1.5 lakhs in the auction.

358
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,007
You know that. - What?

359
00:21:07,211 --> 00:21:08,678
Yes, so I will give you in the evening.

360
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,847
Even then something will be left.

361
00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:12,175
You are too much!

362
00:21:12,383 --> 00:21:13,509
The boat that has come first will also...

363
00:21:13,718 --> 00:21:16,516
...go first and tomorrow also
it will be the first to come.

364
00:21:16,721 --> 00:21:19,349
So I will get 1.5 lakhs tomorrow evening too.
I will get it, right?

365
00:21:20,058 --> 00:21:20,854
Now tell me.

366
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:22,356
How much is the total accounting to?

367
00:21:23,728 --> 00:21:25,855
1.5 and 1.5? - 3

368
00:21:26,064 --> 00:21:27,531
Three. How much do
I have to give you?

369
00:21:28,232 --> 00:21:29,859
2.75. - 2.75.

370
00:21:30,068 --> 00:21:31,365
How much is left?

371
00:21:31,569 --> 00:21:34,538
25... 25,000.
- This much is left. - Yes.

372
00:21:34,739 --> 00:21:36,866
That means you have to
give me 25,000 rupees.

373
00:21:37,075 --> 00:21:39,543
Correct? - Yes.

374
00:21:39,744 --> 00:21:41,541
When will you give me? - What?

375
00:21:41,746 --> 00:21:43,543
When will you give me 25,000 rupees?

376
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:46,880
I will give you?
- What do you mean by that?

377
00:21:47,085 --> 00:21:48,712
When will you give?
- I said I will give you.

378
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,046
What does this mean!

379
00:21:50,321 --> 00:21:51,879
Isn't my money, money?

380
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:53,887
And don't try to change my topic!

381
00:21:54,092 --> 00:21:56,560
I must get my money
by day after tomorrow.

382
00:21:56,761 --> 00:21:57,728
Or else I will shave your moustache...

383
00:21:57,929 --> 00:21:58,896
...and make you sit on a donkey.

384
00:21:59,097 --> 00:22:00,564
He just claims! He will give it.

385
00:22:00,765 --> 00:22:02,733
Remember that you have come
across a Bengali guy!

386
00:22:02,934 --> 00:22:03,730
What happened?

387
00:22:04,802 --> 00:22:07,896
1.5 and 1.5... 3.

388
00:22:09,107 --> 00:22:13,066
2.75... 25.
But when did he give my money?

389
00:22:13,945 --> 00:22:16,573
Move! Go away!

390
00:22:16,781 --> 00:22:19,079
Beware! No one step into the boat!

391
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:22,080
Whoever wants to auction it,
must stand in the front.

392
00:22:22,286 --> 00:22:23,412
And if you don't have money in your
pockets then don't say anything.

393
00:22:23,621 --> 00:22:24,417
First me!

394
00:22:24,622 --> 00:22:27,420
What are you doing? Is your wife
in my boat that you have jumped in?

395
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:28,421
Get out! Go away!

396
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:35,925
There is not even a single fish!

397
00:22:43,975 --> 00:22:45,272
Bandya! - Yes!

398
00:22:46,144 --> 00:22:48,442
Bandya, is this a mermaid?
- No, it is not a mermaid.

399
00:22:49,647 --> 00:22:50,443
Yes.

400
00:22:51,482 --> 00:22:54,781
Is this a dead body? - Yes.
- Who says it is a dead body?

401
00:22:54,986 --> 00:22:55,611
This is a dead body.

402
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,617
Open his mouth and see,
he is still breathing.

403
00:22:57,822 --> 00:22:58,618
He is breathing?

404
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:00,787
Now what will I tell
that moustache guy?

405
00:23:01,392 --> 00:23:03,121
What is the need to tell
the moustache guy everything?

406
00:23:03,394 --> 00:23:05,453
You alone are capable to
take him to the hospital.

407
00:23:06,497 --> 00:23:08,294
You have got me trapped very well!

408
00:23:08,499 --> 00:23:10,467
Now as soon as I threw the
fishing net I caught him.

409
00:23:10,668 --> 00:23:11,134
He was alive.

410
00:23:11,335 --> 00:23:12,632
So I let go of the fishes
and got him here.

411
00:23:12,837 --> 00:23:14,134
You did a good thing.
A very good thing.

412
00:23:14,672 --> 00:23:15,798
Shut up! Close your mouth!

413
00:23:16,507 --> 00:23:20,637
Sir, you will get the moon
from the President on 15th August.

414
00:23:20,845 --> 00:23:21,812
So will I lick the moon!

415
00:23:22,013 --> 00:23:25,141
Not that moon! Gold medal.

416
00:23:25,349 --> 00:23:26,475
Gold medal, scoundrel!

417
00:23:26,684 --> 00:23:27,981
First I am finding it difficult
to live hand to mouth...

418
00:23:28,186 --> 00:23:29,483
...and on top of that this
new problem is on my head!

419
00:23:29,854 --> 00:23:30,980
Come, hold his legs!

420
00:23:32,356 --> 00:23:34,324
Not mine! Hold the legs
of the dead body!

421
00:23:34,692 --> 00:23:38,651
If I didn't get this dead body to the
hospital on time and if he dies...

422
00:23:38,863 --> 00:23:40,160
...here then I will definitely
land up into a big mess!

423
00:23:40,364 --> 00:23:41,661
Call! Call 3 to 4 people!

424
00:23:41,899 --> 00:23:42,831
Come! - Come!

425
00:23:43,201 --> 00:23:45,328
What are you all standing and
staring at my face! Come!

426
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,357
Get up! Get up!

427
00:24:13,064 --> 00:24:13,689
What happened?

428
00:24:13,898 --> 00:24:15,695
Go and get these medicines quickly.
Go fast.

429
00:24:17,401 --> 00:24:18,527
Get up! Get up!

430
00:24:18,903 --> 00:24:20,200
Why should I get these?

431
00:24:20,571 --> 00:24:21,868
How much ever medicines are
in the hospital make him have...

432
00:24:22,073 --> 00:24:24,041
...half spoons of each and he will be fine.

433
00:24:24,242 --> 00:24:26,540
Even the oxygen cylinder
is getting over.

434
00:24:26,744 --> 00:24:27,870
We have to get a new one.

435
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:29,546
The entire cylinder is over? - Yes.

436
00:24:30,481 --> 00:24:32,540
Which side of your teeth is paining?
- This side.

437
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:33,717
Just wait. I will call you.

438
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:36,216
Open the windows of the hospital and...

439
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,546
...tell him he will get
as much oxygen he wants.

440
00:24:37,755 --> 00:24:38,380
Why don't you understand?

441
00:24:43,094 --> 00:24:44,891
I have got hurt and
he himself is crying.

442
00:24:46,764 --> 00:24:48,391
Come on, boss. Sit here.
Sit here.

443
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,067
Sit. Sit.

444
00:24:51,435 --> 00:24:54,404
Boss, is everything fine.
- No, it is paining. - Okay.

445
00:24:54,605 --> 00:24:56,903
First go and see whether he has
come to his senses. - Okay.

446
00:24:57,942 --> 00:25:01,400
Hey! What is this? Where?

447
00:25:01,612 --> 00:25:02,579
What are you doing?

448
00:25:16,294 --> 00:25:17,420
Boss!

449
00:25:21,966 --> 00:25:24,264
Boss, where were you? I was searching
for you since so long.

450
00:25:24,535 --> 00:25:26,093
What happened? - Doctor has called.

451
00:25:26,971 --> 00:25:28,438
I don't want to come.
- Why?

452
00:25:28,973 --> 00:25:31,601
He removed my tooth.
I don't know what all will he remove.

453
00:25:31,809 --> 00:25:33,777
I don't want to come.
- Tooth? - Yes.

454
00:25:34,812 --> 00:25:37,781
First of all I didn't have
anything to lose.

455
00:25:37,982 --> 00:25:40,109
This tooth wasn't even
giving me any problem.

456
00:25:40,484 --> 00:25:42,611
That guy just pulled it out deliberately.

457
00:25:42,987 --> 00:25:45,455
But I don't know what all will
go of mine over here today!

458
00:25:45,656 --> 00:25:48,124
Nothing will go. It will only come.
It will only come.

459
00:25:48,326 --> 00:25:49,953
What will come? The string of your pants?

460
00:25:51,329 --> 00:25:51,795
Come. You first come.

461
00:25:53,998 --> 00:25:56,125
Come... come.

462
00:25:57,001 --> 00:26:00,129
This guy who is lying down here.
Do you know who he is? - Who is he?

463
00:26:00,338 --> 00:26:03,637
He is a millionaire! Millionaire!
- Millionaire?

464
00:26:03,908 --> 00:26:04,806
And he got trapped by you?

465
00:26:05,009 --> 00:26:06,636
Only millionaire's get trapped.

466
00:26:06,911 --> 00:26:09,141
Don't you believe?
Do you know what is this?

467
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,148
This is the underwear.
- This is not underwear. It is a letter.

468
00:26:12,717 --> 00:26:14,309
This is not an ordinary letter.

469
00:26:14,518 --> 00:26:17,316
In this it is written
that this man has...

470
00:26:17,521 --> 00:26:18,988
...to take money from
how many people.

471
00:26:19,857 --> 00:26:21,324
Full account is written and
that too in lakhs.

472
00:26:23,361 --> 00:26:24,828
And the people who couldn't
return his money...

473
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:26,326
...must have thrown him into the ocean.

474
00:26:29,266 --> 00:26:31,826
See his face. Is it like yours?
No, right?

475
00:26:32,036 --> 00:26:33,503
Doesn't he look that he has come
from a nice family background?

476
00:26:33,704 --> 00:26:35,501
Boss, it is very easy.

477
00:26:35,706 --> 00:26:37,674
We saved his life.
How much will we get for that?

478
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:41,834
At least 5 lakhs we will get for that.
- From whom? - His father.

479
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:45,344
Do you know his father? - That... that...
his mother will be aware of.

480
00:26:45,549 --> 00:26:48,848
Who is his mother? - That we will ask him.
- Who is he?

481
00:26:49,053 --> 00:26:51,851
Those people must be knowing him.
- Who! - His parents.

482
00:26:52,556 --> 00:26:56,185
Without knowing him how will
we get to know his parents? Idiot!

483
00:26:57,395 --> 00:26:59,022
I have one idea. - What?

484
00:26:59,397 --> 00:27:01,865
We will show him his own photo
and ask him who he is.

485
00:27:02,066 --> 00:27:04,364
Then at least he will say who he is.
- Very good!

486
00:27:07,238 --> 00:27:09,035
Boss! He has come! - Who? - Senses.

487
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,207
He has come back to his senses.

488
00:27:10,408 --> 00:27:11,875
See he has opened his eyes and is laughing.

489
00:27:16,747 --> 00:27:19,875
You haven't died. You are alive.

490
00:27:20,584 --> 00:27:22,882
Those people from whom
you have to take money...

491
00:27:23,087 --> 00:27:25,385
...I have the entire list with me. It is secure.

492
00:27:25,923 --> 00:27:28,050
We will take it back
from them together.

493
00:27:28,592 --> 00:27:29,718
I am with you.

494
00:27:30,594 --> 00:27:34,724
Tell me, dear, where is your name?
Where are your parents?

495
00:27:34,932 --> 00:27:36,559
Where do they stay?

496
00:27:38,102 --> 00:27:40,570
Can you listen to what we are saying?

497
00:27:41,272 --> 00:27:41,738
How will he listen?

498
00:27:41,939 --> 00:27:43,907
Water must have gone into his ears.

499
00:27:44,942 --> 00:27:46,910
Water has gone into
his ears not his mouth.

500
00:27:47,111 --> 00:27:47,577
Tell me!

501
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:52,238
See, we are not your enemies.
We are your friends. - Yes.

502
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:55,077
See, I swear by this bottle of glucose.

503
00:27:55,286 --> 00:27:57,584
I have spent a lot of money on you.
- He is right!

504
00:27:59,623 --> 00:28:04,253
Hey! See the 5 lakhs that
I am going to get for saving...

505
00:28:04,462 --> 00:28:06,760
...your life from that you give me
2 lakhs now. Advance!

506
00:28:09,967 --> 00:28:11,594
He has fainted again!

507
00:28:18,642 --> 00:28:19,609
Oh no!

508
00:28:20,644 --> 00:28:21,611
He drank the entire thing!

509
00:28:22,146 --> 00:28:24,114
He drank all the 6 bowls of it!

510
00:28:25,483 --> 00:28:26,609
Keep it. Keep it.

511
00:28:26,817 --> 00:28:29,285
Tell him! Ask him! Who are his parents?
Where are they?

512
00:28:29,487 --> 00:28:30,283
When will he give our money?

513
00:28:30,488 --> 00:28:31,455
Did you tell him that or no?

514
00:28:36,994 --> 00:28:40,623
So till now haven't you realized
that he is deaf!

515
00:28:47,171 --> 00:28:49,298
He is deaf! Oh no!

516
00:28:49,507 --> 00:28:51,805
He just understands one language.
Of signs!

517
00:28:52,009 --> 00:28:53,806
Boss, look at me. I will show you.

518
00:28:58,682 --> 00:29:00,809
Boss, see what he said.
He wants more soup.

519
00:29:01,018 --> 00:29:02,485
He is not just deaf but dumb too.

520
00:29:02,686 --> 00:29:04,483
So do you have money with you?
- No. - No?

521
00:29:04,688 --> 00:29:06,315
Then will your father
pay for more soup?

522
00:29:06,524 --> 00:29:09,152
He just tries to act frail,
but he eats a lot.

523
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,157
Don't ask him such futile things!

524
00:29:11,529 --> 00:29:14,327
Scoundrel has put on a lot of
weight after eating so much!

525
00:29:14,532 --> 00:29:15,328
You jerk!

526
00:29:15,533 --> 00:29:16,830
Hey! Where have you come from!

527
00:29:17,201 --> 00:29:18,498
Where is your house!

528
00:29:18,769 --> 00:29:20,669
Boss, ask him in sign language.

529
00:29:20,871 --> 00:29:21,997
So then you ask him!

530
00:29:22,206 --> 00:29:25,004
Ask him where is his house?
Ask! - Fine.

531
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:31,170
Your... house... bar.

532
00:29:31,382 --> 00:29:33,350
Where is your house?

533
00:29:36,053 --> 00:29:37,020
He is asking for more soup.

534
00:29:37,388 --> 00:29:39,686
Not soup... house.
- Shut up, you fool!

535
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:41,187
You just talk about food items to him.

536
00:29:41,392 --> 00:29:42,689
Now I will talk to him.
- Ask, boss.

537
00:29:42,893 --> 00:29:47,023
Your... village.

538
00:29:51,068 --> 00:29:54,037
Well... water.

539
00:29:54,238 --> 00:29:59,039
Your village... village where is it?
Where is it?

540
00:30:00,411 --> 00:30:03,039
Which village is this? - He is asking
where is your village?

541
00:30:03,747 --> 00:30:04,543
It is the graveyard.

542
00:30:07,251 --> 00:30:11,051
I will ask you about all the
places of India in sign language.

543
00:30:11,255 --> 00:30:14,053
You tell me which is your place?

544
00:30:20,097 --> 00:30:20,722
What is this?

545
00:30:21,498 --> 00:30:23,398
You didn't understand?
- No. - Latur.

546
00:30:23,601 --> 00:30:25,068
I am kicking. Latur.

547
00:30:25,936 --> 00:30:28,234
When you said it now from your
mouth then I understood.

548
00:30:28,439 --> 00:30:29,906
Okay, at least one fool understood.

549
00:30:30,107 --> 00:30:31,574
Now how will anyone explain this fool?

550
00:30:31,775 --> 00:30:33,402
Boss, ask him about Ratnagiri.

551
00:30:33,944 --> 00:30:35,571
Ratnagiri... Ratnagiri.

552
00:30:37,281 --> 00:30:39,749
Ratna (gem)... Ratna!

553
00:30:42,453 --> 00:30:43,579
Giri? Giri?

554
00:30:44,121 --> 00:30:45,088
Come here.

555
00:30:45,322 --> 00:30:45,913
Yes, boss.

556
00:30:46,457 --> 00:30:49,915
Ratna... Giri.

557
00:30:50,127 --> 00:30:51,924
Ratnagiri. Ratnagiri.

558
00:30:54,632 --> 00:30:55,599
You haven't understood correctly.

559
00:30:56,133 --> 00:30:58,431
I will ask him about here.
About Calcutta.

560
00:31:01,305 --> 00:31:04,433
Call... Call... then cut it.

561
00:31:04,642 --> 00:31:06,940
Boss, ask carefully or else
he will cut me up.

562
00:31:07,211 --> 00:31:09,441
So then what should I do?
What should we do?

563
00:31:10,147 --> 00:31:12,274
Ask him about Boribandar, boss.

564
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:13,948
Boribandar? - Yes.

565
00:31:18,155 --> 00:31:20,282
Bori (sack)... understood?

566
00:31:20,824 --> 00:31:24,783
Load it once again, boss.
- Now you tell him about the Bandar(monkey)

567
00:31:27,998 --> 00:31:29,795
Understood? Boribandar.

568
00:31:30,367 --> 00:31:31,299
Did you understand, fool?

569
00:31:31,568 --> 00:31:34,298
Who is Gundya-bhau here? - He.

570
00:31:35,172 --> 00:31:36,469
Come here. - What happened?

571
00:31:37,574 --> 00:31:40,805
We have got to know that you have
got a big thing from the ocean.

572
00:31:41,011 --> 00:31:41,978
Whatever you have got you have to...

573
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:43,976
...come with it to the
police station with me.

574
00:31:46,016 --> 00:31:48,484
Bandya! - Yes, boss.
- Get that big thing.

575
00:31:50,187 --> 00:31:50,983
So is this it?

576
00:31:51,188 --> 00:31:53,486
So did you think we have got
gold and silver?

577
00:31:53,691 --> 00:31:55,318
Who is he? From where has he come from?

578
00:31:55,526 --> 00:31:57,994
Till we don't get to know about that
we won't leave him.

579
00:31:58,696 --> 00:32:01,494
This is a very good thing
that you have said. Fine.

580
00:32:01,699 --> 00:32:04,998
But, since we don't have a complaint...

581
00:32:05,202 --> 00:32:06,829
...against him we can't
even keep him inside.

582
00:32:07,871 --> 00:32:09,839
As of now I am letting him
go with you two.

583
00:32:10,207 --> 00:32:14,166
And whenever I call you, you will
have to take him and come.

584
00:32:14,712 --> 00:32:16,179
This is your responsibility.

585
00:32:19,383 --> 00:32:21,010
Sir, the money...

586
00:32:21,285 --> 00:32:26,348
No, no. I don't want any money.
I am just doing you a favour.

587
00:32:26,557 --> 00:32:28,115
Just think of it in that sense. Go.

588
00:32:29,059 --> 00:32:30,526
Is this what we call living?

589
00:32:30,728 --> 00:32:32,696
It is worse than the living of the
dog of a washer man!

590
00:32:32,896 --> 00:32:36,855
And on top of that this evil guy!
- And both of us are completely bankrupt.

591
00:32:39,236 --> 00:32:41,363
I have given you my shirt to wear.

592
00:32:41,572 --> 00:32:42,869
Now after it gets dirty and starts...

593
00:32:43,073 --> 00:32:44,370
...stinking only then will
I give you another one!

594
00:32:45,909 --> 00:32:47,877
Yamaha? No, I will get you a
Hero Honda. Come.

595
00:32:51,081 --> 00:32:53,379
Why are we going this side?
- That I don't know, boss.

596
00:32:53,584 --> 00:32:54,710
But why are you dragging me?

597
00:32:54,985 --> 00:32:55,883
Where am I dragging you?

598
00:33:01,091 --> 00:33:02,718
So he was the one who was pulling us here!

599
00:33:03,093 --> 00:33:04,060
Oh this poor chap must be feeling hungry!

600
00:33:04,261 --> 00:33:06,388
He can't speak. He is dumb.
That's why he got us here.

601
00:33:08,098 --> 00:33:10,225
Boss, don't touch it.

602
00:33:12,102 --> 00:33:13,899
He is asking for chips.

603
00:33:14,104 --> 00:33:15,401
It's not a lizard, boss.

604
00:33:15,606 --> 00:33:16,231
Hey! Don't snatch it. Don't snatch it.

605
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,737
What misbehaviour is this, boss?

606
00:33:19,476 --> 00:33:20,238
Go! Move away!

607
00:33:21,945 --> 00:33:23,742
Sir! Give me 3 cups of tea.

608
00:33:23,947 --> 00:33:26,074
2 proper ones and one without sugar
and with less milk.

609
00:33:26,283 --> 00:33:27,079
For who is that, boss?

610
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:30,916
We will have to make him
drink a bad tea. - Is it?

611
00:33:31,121 --> 00:33:32,247
If we give him a good tea
then he will be...

612
00:33:32,456 --> 00:33:34,424
...habituated to it and will get us
here everyday by dragging us.

613
00:33:34,792 --> 00:33:36,089
Sir, do one thing.

614
00:33:36,293 --> 00:33:38,090
From his share put sugar and
more milk in my tea. - Yes.

615
00:33:38,295 --> 00:33:40,593
Why? - Boss, you are paying
for all three, right?

616
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:41,765
Paying for all three!

617
00:33:42,032 --> 00:33:43,431
Are you abusing? - Shut up!

618
00:33:45,135 --> 00:33:47,763
Boss, what have you thought of ahead?

619
00:33:47,971 --> 00:33:50,940
Ahead? First let me get
rid of this ghost.

620
00:33:51,141 --> 00:33:52,267
We will think later of
what needs to be done ahead.

621
00:33:52,476 --> 00:33:53,943
Give me tea, please. - Yes.

622
00:33:54,144 --> 00:33:56,271
Leave it! Leave it!

623
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:00,438
It is not mine! It is not mine!
- Don't hit him, boss.

624
00:34:00,717 --> 00:34:01,945
The hen has given them.

625
00:34:13,831 --> 00:34:14,798
What is he saying?

626
00:34:14,998 --> 00:34:16,295
He is asking for boiled egg.

627
00:34:18,202 --> 00:34:20,796
Give him boiled water. Tell him that
the egg has got boiled inside it.

628
00:34:21,071 --> 00:34:22,299
He is dumb. He won't come to know.

629
00:34:22,506 --> 00:34:23,131
Give it to him.

630
00:34:25,175 --> 00:34:25,800
Hey! Hey!

631
00:34:35,853 --> 00:34:37,150
There is no sugar in this at all.

632
00:34:37,688 --> 00:34:39,656
Over here when you say without sugar...

633
00:34:40,357 --> 00:34:41,483
...you get it absolutely without sugar.

634
00:34:41,859 --> 00:34:43,827
Do you make tea or are you fooling us?

635
00:34:44,761 --> 00:34:47,321
Tea without sugar. - My tea is very sweet.

636
00:34:47,531 --> 00:34:48,498
So you only give the money.

637
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,667
Boss, now since we have spent so much
we will take one chips too.

638
00:34:55,038 --> 00:34:56,505
Give him also one.

639
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,177
Boss, Jabba has gone.

640
00:35:06,049 --> 00:35:07,016
Gone? - Yes.

641
00:35:07,784 --> 00:35:08,682
He has gone!

642
00:35:09,553 --> 00:35:10,349
I am saved.

643
00:35:10,787 --> 00:35:12,015
Where did he go? - How do I know?

644
00:35:12,222 --> 00:35:14,019
Fool, catch him or else the
police will catch us.

645
00:35:14,391 --> 00:35:16,518
Where did he go?
Where did he go? Jabba!

646
00:35:20,898 --> 00:35:25,358
Hello! - Hello... I am Jeet.

647
00:35:26,236 --> 00:35:32,038
Who is speaking? - Hello.
I am Jeet's friend speaking.

648
00:35:32,242 --> 00:35:33,209
Is Mohan-ji there?

649
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:35,708
See we haven't got the money till now.

650
00:35:36,246 --> 00:35:39,215
But we will get the insurance money
as soon as possible.

651
00:35:39,416 --> 00:35:41,043
We are trying hard for it.

652
00:35:42,085 --> 00:35:44,053
Actually the thing is that the body
is nowhere to be found.

653
00:35:44,254 --> 00:35:46,722
So this is for sure that he is dead.

654
00:35:47,424 --> 00:35:49,892
If he were alive we would
have known by now.

655
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,887
How much do you have to take?

656
00:35:53,263 --> 00:35:54,730
Boss, see that! See that!

657
00:35:57,267 --> 00:35:59,895
Come, come. He is hiding and sitting here.
Catch him red-handed.

658
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:01,068
He is inside.

659
00:36:01,438 --> 00:36:05,238
Hey! Hey! One has to speak in it.
This is of no use to you. Keep it.

660
00:36:11,114 --> 00:36:13,412
What is this? This bill
just comes out like that.

661
00:36:14,284 --> 00:36:16,752
The machine must be bad. Yes, come.

662
00:36:16,954 --> 00:36:18,421
Hey! Give me the money. - What?

663
00:36:18,855 --> 00:36:20,584
Pay the money for the call.

664
00:36:24,294 --> 00:36:26,762
He can't speak. He is dumb and deaf.

665
00:36:26,964 --> 00:36:28,761
We need to pay money to hold the phone?
What is he talking?

666
00:36:29,132 --> 00:36:31,259
He must be dumb and deaf,
you must...

667
00:36:31,468 --> 00:36:33,936
...be dumb and deaf but
I am not dumb and deaf.

668
00:36:34,304 --> 00:36:37,603
This bill has come.
Then you have to pay the money.

669
00:36:37,975 --> 00:36:39,602
I will see how he doesn't
pay the money.

670
00:36:40,978 --> 00:36:42,775
Give me the money!
- What if I don't give?

671
00:36:43,146 --> 00:36:44,443
Then I will give!

672
00:36:44,648 --> 00:36:45,444
What did you say? What will you do?

673
00:36:45,649 --> 00:36:49,278
I will give it to him. - To whom?
- I will give him.

674
00:36:49,486 --> 00:36:51,954
You will give him? - I will.
- This means you will hit him.

675
00:36:52,155 --> 00:36:53,782
I will. - You will hit him?
- I will.

676
00:36:53,991 --> 00:36:56,960
Hit him and show.
I want to see. Hit him.

677
00:36:57,227 --> 00:36:58,626
What are you telling him
to hit me for?

678
00:36:58,895 --> 00:37:01,796
Take this. Take this. Your money.

679
00:37:02,499 --> 00:37:05,297
What will you see? He will hit me
and you will see, is it?

680
00:37:05,669 --> 00:37:06,294
What will you see?

681
00:37:06,503 --> 00:37:08,971
Boss! - What is it?
- He has again disappeared.

682
00:37:11,341 --> 00:37:15,300
He was just here. Then where did he go?
Hey! He was here...

683
00:37:16,179 --> 00:37:18,647
Will you just sit here bossing over me...

684
00:37:18,849 --> 00:37:19,645
Find him!

685
00:37:25,522 --> 00:37:27,649
Now keep an eye on him. He should not
sneak away like a cat.

686
00:37:27,858 --> 00:37:28,654
Come! Come! Dumb guy, come on walk!

687
00:37:29,026 --> 00:37:31,153
This thing of trouble had to fall
on my head only! - Yes.

688
00:37:31,361 --> 00:37:33,488
When he fell into my trap I understood...

689
00:37:33,697 --> 00:37:34,664
...then that he is going
to be a burden on you.

690
00:37:34,865 --> 00:37:37,333
So he will be a burden to me only.
How will he a burden to you?

691
00:37:37,534 --> 00:37:39,661
Go... go and untie the boat.
Untie the boat!

692
00:37:40,203 --> 00:37:41,329
The old man always harasses me!

693
00:37:41,538 --> 00:37:44,166
Because of that moustache Gujarati...

694
00:37:44,374 --> 00:37:45,841
...I have hidden and kept
the boat here. Is it?

695
00:37:46,043 --> 00:37:47,670
So that he should not take it and go.
- Till when will we hide it?

696
00:37:49,046 --> 00:37:50,013
That moustache guy will take
the boat and go.

697
00:37:50,213 --> 00:37:51,009
You have said this so many times and...

698
00:37:51,214 --> 00:37:53,182
...not let the boat go into the
waters since a week.

699
00:37:53,383 --> 00:37:56,841
I have become so bankrupt that I don't
even have money to drink water.

700
00:37:57,054 --> 00:37:58,351
I am drinking my own tears and living.

701
00:37:58,555 --> 00:38:00,853
So I should open a food shop
for you amidst the ocean?

702
00:38:01,058 --> 00:38:01,854
Open this!

703
00:38:02,059 --> 00:38:04,186
The only thing left to eat is
grass and raw fish.

704
00:38:04,394 --> 00:38:06,021
Raw fish and on top of
that this crocodile!

705
00:38:06,963 --> 00:38:09,693
Should I say one thing, boss?
Don't mind it. - Tell me.

706
00:38:09,966 --> 00:38:12,366
You are a very big scoundrel! - So I am!

707
00:38:12,569 --> 00:38:13,365
I am.

708
00:38:13,737 --> 00:38:15,705
You take loan but you don't repay it.
- From where will I give it?

709
00:38:15,906 --> 00:38:17,032
First of all there is no money
in the pocket.

710
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,708
And on top of that a ghost in white clothes
is dancing on my head.

711
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:21,707
All of this has happened
because of this unlucky person!

712
00:38:21,912 --> 00:38:22,537
Hey Bandya! Come here.

713
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,378
If within 24 hours
you don't get rid of...

714
00:38:25,582 --> 00:38:28,551
...this trouble then I won't let you
step into the boat.

715
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,888
Even you can't step into the boat.
- Why?

716
00:38:32,089 --> 00:38:34,557
Because that moustache guy has threatened
to take the boat in 20 hours.

717
00:38:34,758 --> 00:38:36,555
Then untie the boat!

718
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:42,398
If you say it in Hindi like this then
I will be able to understand.

719
00:38:47,604 --> 00:38:49,572
Hey! I will give you one
tight slap, you fool!

720
00:38:51,108 --> 00:38:52,234
You must be doomed!

721
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:56,911
Now, we can sell this boat comfortably.

722
00:39:01,618 --> 00:39:03,085
You scoundrel won't go into the boat.

723
00:39:03,286 --> 00:39:04,753
First let this scoundrel go into it.

724
00:39:05,122 --> 00:39:07,920
Come. - Hey! Put your
right leg in first.

725
00:39:08,358 --> 00:39:10,417
Maybe this unlucky person
proves lucky for us.

726
00:39:10,961 --> 00:39:12,258
Put your right leg first!

727
00:39:12,629 --> 00:39:16,087
Hey you fool! Right means
put this leg first. Here.

728
00:39:16,299 --> 00:39:18,096
He has 2 legs still he
doesn't understand. Turn!

729
00:39:18,368 --> 00:39:21,929
See, it is going behind.

730
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:23,765
The platform is not going behind,
you fool!

731
00:39:23,974 --> 00:39:25,100
The boat is going ahead.

732
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,607
Moustache guy!
- We have got ruined!

733
00:39:32,816 --> 00:39:34,283
Moustache guy is taking the
boat and going.

734
00:39:34,484 --> 00:39:36,952
Bandya, jump into the water.
Jump into the water

735
00:39:38,488 --> 00:39:39,785
Why should I jump into
the water and die?

736
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:41,617
The moustache guy has taken
the boat and gone!

737
00:39:43,994 --> 00:39:46,792
This unlucky person, wherever
he steps he brings bad luck.

738
00:39:47,998 --> 00:39:49,295
Boss, he is dumb. Don't hit him.

739
00:39:50,834 --> 00:39:53,962
My boat has gone! Oh God!

740
00:39:54,671 --> 00:39:56,639
Boss! - Yes. - Now it is just too much!

741
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:00,139
Today we will take a decision about this.
- What kind of decision?

742
00:40:00,343 --> 00:40:02,140
First we will straight go to that
moustache guy! - Then?

743
00:40:02,412 --> 00:40:03,640
And then we will ask the moustache guy...

744
00:40:03,847 --> 00:40:05,815
...whether he will return the boat or not.
- Then?

745
00:40:06,016 --> 00:40:08,484
Then the moustache guy will say that
he won't return the boat.

746
00:40:08,685 --> 00:40:10,653
So then? - Then the decision is taken.

747
00:40:12,522 --> 00:40:13,147
Fool!

748
00:40:19,095 --> 00:40:20,653
Hey! Where are you all barging in?

749
00:40:20,897 --> 00:40:21,829
Leave that!

750
00:40:22,098 --> 00:40:26,831
Go and tell that moustache guy in
Gujarati that Gundya-bhau has come.

751
00:40:27,103 --> 00:40:29,162
Tell him! And even tell him that
Bandya is with him too.

752
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,007
Yes! And even the dumb and
deaf guy is also there.

753
00:40:32,209 --> 00:40:34,677
Yes! And tell him that our temper is...

754
00:40:34,878 --> 00:40:37,506
...very bad and if required we can
even wrestle. Tell him.

755
00:40:37,714 --> 00:40:40,012
Oh! Wrestling? Yes, wrestling.
Go and tell him.

756
00:40:41,051 --> 00:40:42,348
That moustache guy stays in Calcutta...

757
00:40:42,552 --> 00:40:44,850
...but keeps a Gujarati watchman
instead of a Bengali or a Nepali.

758
00:40:45,055 --> 00:40:46,181
Tomorrow he only will do a robbery.

759
00:40:46,456 --> 00:40:47,184
Are you a body builder?

760
00:40:47,557 --> 00:40:50,526
It doesn't make any difference.
Go and tell him!

761
00:40:50,794 --> 00:40:53,854
Then you may go inside.
- Come on.

762
00:41:01,071 --> 00:41:03,869
Catch him properly!
Now throw him down!

763
00:41:05,909 --> 00:41:08,036
Boss! You have come at the right time
to get your boat back!

764
00:41:13,083 --> 00:41:13,879
Hey wait!

765
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:20,389
Come on. - Boss, said to leave.
- Not outside. Come inside.

766
00:41:20,757 --> 00:41:21,883
Come inside.

767
00:41:23,093 --> 00:41:25,391
Come! Come, you clever person!

768
00:41:26,162 --> 00:41:27,390
What have you come to take from here?

769
00:41:28,265 --> 00:41:31,063
Greetings, sir. I have come to
take the boat. - Boat?

770
00:41:31,768 --> 00:41:34,066
This is Gujarat. Gujarat!

771
00:41:34,771 --> 00:41:38,070
There is no boat here
nor is there any bottle!

772
00:41:38,608 --> 00:41:39,233
Get out from here.

773
00:41:39,442 --> 00:41:42,900
Don't ruin me. I am a poor person.

774
00:41:43,113 --> 00:41:45,240
Then why are you talking in a lower tone
and flattering me. Speak loudly!

775
00:41:46,116 --> 00:41:47,583
That day what did you tell me when...

776
00:41:47,784 --> 00:41:48,910
...I had come to take the
money from you?

777
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:50,086
In front of everyone.

778
00:41:50,287 --> 00:41:52,414
He said that he will shave my moustache
and make me sit on...

779
00:41:52,622 --> 00:41:53,748
...a donkey and will make me roam
in the entire village.

780
00:41:53,957 --> 00:41:55,083
Now shave my moustache and show.

781
00:41:55,292 --> 00:41:56,759
I don't remember...
Now, shave my moustache.

782
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,418
Shave it! Hold it.
- I didn't say that.

783
00:42:00,964 --> 00:42:01,760
Don't you remember? - No.

784
00:42:02,198 --> 00:42:03,426
Okay, let that be.

785
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,099
You must at least be remembering
what you told...

786
00:42:07,304 --> 00:42:08,931
...to my men when they had gone
to ask for money.

787
00:42:09,205 --> 00:42:14,108
You had said that this is not Gujarat
and that this area is yours!

788
00:42:14,311 --> 00:42:16,279
You even threatened to
break their legs.

789
00:42:16,479 --> 00:42:17,446
You had said this, right?

790
00:42:17,647 --> 00:42:18,443
Didn't you say this or not?

791
00:42:19,482 --> 00:42:23,441
When did I say this?
- No, you had said this.

792
00:42:23,653 --> 00:42:25,621
You had said it. That day
when you were in the boat.

793
00:42:25,822 --> 00:42:26,288
That day you had said it.

794
00:42:26,489 --> 00:42:27,285
And you had also said
that you would...

795
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:29,617
...cut him into pieces and
also feed it to the fishes.

796
00:42:29,826 --> 00:42:30,793
Boss, you had said it, right?

797
00:42:31,027 --> 00:42:32,961
He must have forgotten it.
There is a lot of tension.

798
00:42:33,229 --> 00:42:35,288
Shut up! You jerk! Shut up!

799
00:42:36,032 --> 00:42:38,967
I didn't say that.
I swear by my mother. I didn't.

800
00:42:39,235 --> 00:42:41,965
You must have definitely said it.
I have full faith in you.

801
00:42:42,172 --> 00:42:44,800
You can't rest without
talking ill about me.

802
00:42:45,008 --> 00:42:45,975
I swear by your mother... - Hey!

803
00:42:46,176 --> 00:42:47,302
You point a finger to my mother!

804
00:42:47,577 --> 00:42:48,475
Greetings, mother.

805
00:42:48,678 --> 00:42:50,646
See! You are not aware of the
power of Gujaratis.

806
00:42:50,847 --> 00:42:52,815
If you have the guts then come
into the wrestling ring...

807
00:42:53,016 --> 00:42:56,144
...wrestle it out, defeat anyone of us
and take your boat back.

808
00:42:57,053 --> 00:42:58,315
This is a very good
opportunity, sir.

809
00:42:58,521 --> 00:43:00,819
We will defeat a few
and take the boat back.

810
00:43:03,193 --> 00:43:04,820
Hey! What are you whispering?

811
00:43:05,028 --> 00:43:05,824
If you have the guts then come.

812
00:43:06,029 --> 00:43:09,157
If I win then will I get the boat back?
- Absolutely.

813
00:43:09,866 --> 00:43:12,994
And my money? - That loan I am willing
to forego. - Forego? - Yes.

814
00:43:13,203 --> 00:43:15,000
Sure? - Sure. - You promise
in front of everyone? - Yes

815
00:43:15,271 --> 00:43:16,329
Come on, come on.

816
00:43:18,041 --> 00:43:19,838
Mother, give me the blessing so that
I can defeat your son.

817
00:43:20,043 --> 00:43:21,340
Give me the blessing. - Yes.

818
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:30,679
Hail Goddess Durga! Finish them!

819
00:43:32,889 --> 00:43:34,186
Why is he coming back?

820
00:43:34,391 --> 00:43:36,859
This is wrong. This is wrong.
I am not going to go ahead with this.

821
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:37,685
Boss, what happened?

822
00:43:38,628 --> 00:43:41,688
He has worn the underwear.
So what do you have to do with that?

823
00:43:41,898 --> 00:43:43,024
But I haven't worn it.

824
00:43:43,633 --> 00:43:46,033
You should have at least worn underwear
at someone else's house.

825
00:43:46,236 --> 00:43:48,534
What to do? Even the underwear
is with him. - How is that?

826
00:43:48,905 --> 00:43:51,032
I had kept the underwear
on the boat to dry.

827
00:43:51,241 --> 00:43:52,208
The boat has gone and
so has the underwear.

828
00:43:52,442 --> 00:43:54,376
So first we will ask for the underwear
then we will ask for the boat.

829
00:43:54,577 --> 00:43:56,204
No, first the boat then underwear.

830
00:43:56,579 --> 00:43:58,046
Why? What happened?

831
00:43:58,248 --> 00:44:00,546
Have you got scared already?

832
00:44:00,784 --> 00:44:02,046
No, not like that.

833
00:44:02,252 --> 00:44:03,719
If something else goes wrong, then...

834
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,718
...he doesn't have what is needed to save him.

835
00:44:06,923 --> 00:44:13,556
And Chauhan sir, don't think that
we are... cowards. No.

836
00:44:13,797 --> 00:44:17,733
My father and grandfathers...
were fighters. Yes!

837
00:44:18,001 --> 00:44:21,562
And in his family...
- All of them were warriors. - Yes.

838
00:44:21,771 --> 00:44:23,568
That's why he is going to
fight instead of me. - Yes.

839
00:44:26,109 --> 00:44:27,235
How can I fight?

840
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:29,578
Why? Aren't you a warrior?

841
00:44:29,779 --> 00:44:31,747
I am... but I am not going to fight...

842
00:44:32,015 --> 00:44:32,572
Hey, keep quiet, you dumb guy!

843
00:44:33,116 --> 00:44:35,243
He is right. - I can't fight with him.

844
00:44:35,785 --> 00:44:37,582
Fine then, you can fight with Sheetal.

845
00:44:37,787 --> 00:44:38,754
Sheetal!

846
00:44:39,622 --> 00:44:40,919
Now you will come to know.

847
00:44:56,306 --> 00:44:57,603
Sheetal!

848
00:45:00,643 --> 00:45:01,769
Sheetal! Sheetal! Sheetal!

849
00:45:09,385 --> 00:45:10,283
This is deceitful!

850
00:45:10,653 --> 00:45:11,620
What kind of names have you kept?

851
00:45:11,821 --> 00:45:13,288
You give a man a female name!

852
00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:15,958
This is unjust! I won't fight with him.

853
00:45:16,659 --> 00:45:17,455
Go!

854
00:45:21,831 --> 00:45:25,631
Sheetal! Sheetal! Sheetal! Sheetal!

855
00:45:26,836 --> 00:45:28,133
Catch him! Catch him!

856
00:45:33,843 --> 00:45:35,140
Catch that lizard!

857
00:45:46,356 --> 00:45:48,324
Catch him by the neck.
- Yes, catch him.

858
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:03,835
Tear him apart!

859
00:46:04,207 --> 00:46:06,505
And after tearing him apart throw one...

860
00:46:06,709 --> 00:46:09,678
...piece in Surat and the
other in Ahmedabad!

861
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,347
Turn him around! Turn him around!

862
00:46:19,055 --> 00:46:20,352
No! No!

863
00:46:31,234 --> 00:46:32,201
Come here.

864
00:46:35,905 --> 00:46:39,864
He is dumb! He is dumb!
Don't hit him.

865
00:46:40,076 --> 00:46:41,373
Leave him and catch him.

866
00:46:42,478 --> 00:46:46,209
Even I am dumb. Even I am dumb.
Someone tell him.

867
00:46:46,416 --> 00:46:47,383
Okay, let him go.

868
00:46:48,818 --> 00:46:54,051
See, this was not a fight. - Then?
- This was just a game for us.

869
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:57,891
This was a game. - Yes, this was a game.
Now the fight will start.

870
00:46:58,094 --> 00:47:00,062
Hit him! Hit him! - Wait. Wait!

871
00:47:01,097 --> 00:47:06,228
By hitting us or by capturing our boat
will you get your money?

872
00:47:06,502 --> 00:47:08,402
So then what else should I do!

873
00:47:08,605 --> 00:47:13,406
Give me my boat back and I will sell it
and repay your entire loan back.

874
00:47:13,610 --> 00:47:17,239
Seriously.
- No! I don't trust you at all.

875
00:47:17,947 --> 00:47:21,405
If I give you your boat back then
again you will disappear. - No!

876
00:47:22,285 --> 00:47:24,583
I can give you your boat back
only on one condition. - What?

877
00:47:24,787 --> 00:47:27,255
If you mortgage something that you own.

878
00:47:27,457 --> 00:47:30,255
Now whatever I have is
already mortgaged to you.

879
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:32,428
To free that what else
should I mortgage?

880
00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:36,929
That I don't know.
I want something or the other.

881
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,929
Either house, land or wife.

882
00:47:39,135 --> 00:47:41,763
Oh God! Now where will
I get a wife from?

883
00:47:46,476 --> 00:47:49,775
Sir, you don't trust me, right? - No.

884
00:47:49,979 --> 00:47:53,608
So till the time I don't come back
I am mortgaging him.

885
00:47:53,816 --> 00:47:55,283
Okay? - He? Who is he?

886
00:47:55,485 --> 00:47:58,283
He... he is my only nephew.

887
00:47:58,821 --> 00:48:02,120
I have raised him with a lot of love.

888
00:48:02,558 --> 00:48:05,459
I never used to keep him down,
lest some snake should bite him.

889
00:48:05,828 --> 00:48:06,795
I never kept him over my head...

890
00:48:06,996 --> 00:48:08,463
...lest crows or vultures take him away.

891
00:48:08,898 --> 00:48:12,800
I have always kept him in my lap.
On my lap.

892
00:48:13,503 --> 00:48:16,472
My dear nephew! Kanhaiya.

893
00:48:18,508 --> 00:48:23,468
I... I cannot stay for a
moment without you.

894
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:25,808
What should I do?

895
00:48:26,049 --> 00:48:27,983
I don't have any other way.

896
00:48:28,184 --> 00:48:32,314
Till the time your uncle doesn't repay...

897
00:48:32,522 --> 00:48:34,490
...back the money you will
have to stay here.

898
00:48:34,691 --> 00:48:35,487
Oh God!

899
00:48:36,359 --> 00:48:40,159
Boss! Boss!

900
00:48:40,697 --> 00:48:47,000
You can't stay even for a moment away
from a poor man like me.

901
00:48:47,870 --> 00:48:53,331
Then how will you remain alive
without your dearest nephew?

902
00:48:55,044 --> 00:48:56,341
Boss!

903
00:49:01,884 --> 00:49:03,010
Hey! Shut up!

904
00:49:06,556 --> 00:49:11,186
So... you also can't bear
his separation. Enough.

905
00:49:11,394 --> 00:49:14,022
So fine. Then even leave him here.
- What?

906
00:49:14,397 --> 00:49:16,365
No, no. This can't happen. - Why?

907
00:49:16,566 --> 00:49:20,525
Because I can't be away from my boss.

908
00:49:20,737 --> 00:49:21,863
Bandya! - Yes.

909
00:49:22,572 --> 00:49:23,869
Bandya! - Yes.

910
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,868
I will bear the separation of yours, Bandya.

911
00:49:27,076 --> 00:49:28,873
I will bear it. Go!

912
00:49:29,245 --> 00:49:31,372
Boss!

913
00:49:32,081 --> 00:49:34,709
Seth-ji, I am taking my boat and going.

914
00:49:34,917 --> 00:49:36,043
But my dearest one and the not so...

915
00:49:36,252 --> 00:49:38,880
...dearest one I am leaving
here and going.

916
00:49:39,255 --> 00:49:43,214
Saw! Did you see the result of
taking on Chauhan?

917
00:49:43,426 --> 00:49:44,893
Yes, I saw.

918
00:49:46,929 --> 00:49:51,059
Children, take care of yourself.
And I will come on the 2nd.

919
00:49:52,268 --> 00:49:56,398
Bandya! In every month there
is a date for the 2nd.

920
00:49:56,672 --> 00:50:01,405
Don't go. - I have given my word.
- Then take it back.

921
00:50:01,778 --> 00:50:05,908
Take them and go.
- Separate them from me.

922
00:50:09,619 --> 00:50:11,484
Be happy, dear!
- I am taking my bag.

923
00:50:16,626 --> 00:50:21,427
The poor man is crying and going.
- Let him, he will learn a lesson.

924
00:50:21,731 --> 00:50:23,961
Now he will come to know how cunning I am!

925
00:50:27,303 --> 00:50:29,931
I got rid of the dumb guy, the fool
and also got my boat back.

926
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:34,109
It will be better if you listen to me
and do as I say.

927
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:36,437
Or else? - It will bad for me!

928
00:50:36,646 --> 00:50:39,274
I am the manager over here.
NatwarJhunjhunwala!

929
00:50:39,482 --> 00:50:40,949
Whatever you might say,
he won't hear.

930
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:41,946
How will he not hear?

931
00:50:42,151 --> 00:50:43,448
I will teach him a lesson.
This is good!

932
00:50:44,053 --> 00:50:45,611
Tell me, Jabba! Jabba!
Will you listen to me?

933
00:50:45,988 --> 00:50:47,455
Should I show you how
hot blooded my hand is?

934
00:50:47,657 --> 00:50:48,624
This is absolutely cold. - Hey!

935
00:50:49,325 --> 00:50:51,953
I will show the both of you!
To the both of you!

936
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:57,966
Where are you going?

937
00:50:58,167 --> 00:50:59,634
You only said that
you are showing something.

938
00:50:59,836 --> 00:51:01,963
I will give you only one...
Not one, they are 2.

939
00:51:02,672 --> 00:51:03,468
What is the matter?

940
00:51:04,006 --> 00:51:06,634
He was showing you all to us.
- No, madam.

941
00:51:06,843 --> 00:51:08,310
These people haven't seen you all.

942
00:51:08,511 --> 00:51:09,978
No, no. We have seen.
We have seen you completely.

943
00:51:10,346 --> 00:51:11,643
You jerk! I will kill you.

944
00:51:12,081 --> 00:51:12,979
Hey! What is this happening?

945
00:51:13,349 --> 00:51:14,976
Nothing is happening. Nothing.

946
00:51:15,351 --> 00:51:17,148
I was taking their size for new clothes.

947
00:51:17,353 --> 00:51:18,650
I have to make new clothes for them.

948
00:51:18,855 --> 00:51:21,153
There is no need to make
new clothes for them.

949
00:51:21,357 --> 00:51:23,825
They are the servants for this house.
They are not the kids of your uncle.

950
00:51:24,193 --> 00:51:26,161
There are old clothes in the house.
Give something from them.

951
00:51:26,362 --> 00:51:27,989
Get them inside.

952
00:51:32,869 --> 00:51:35,497
Amongst the both of you who knows to
polish the shoes well?

953
00:51:39,575 --> 00:51:43,341
I don't know. He knows it very well.
He is a pro at it.

954
00:51:43,579 --> 00:51:46,343
What is your name? - Bandya.
- What, is it Dandiya?

955
00:51:46,549 --> 00:51:47,846
Bandya... Bandya. - Okay, Dandya.

956
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:48,846
Dandya, see.

957
00:51:49,051 --> 00:51:50,348
First you learn to polish shoes.

958
00:51:52,388 --> 00:51:52,854
Natwar!

959
00:51:53,222 --> 00:51:56,020
Get all the shoes of this house
and give to him.

960
00:51:56,726 --> 00:51:57,522
Come, cobbler!

961
00:52:02,398 --> 00:52:05,196
If I would polish so many shoes
on the footpath, I would have...

962
00:52:05,401 --> 00:52:09,201
...earned so much as to buy a boat
in a week's time.

963
00:52:09,572 --> 00:52:10,539
Take this.

964
00:52:11,407 --> 00:52:13,204
These are a little old shoes.

965
00:52:13,409 --> 00:52:15,877
Use them for practice and know how to
properly polish shoes.

966
00:52:16,078 --> 00:52:17,204
And we will give you new ones too.

967
00:52:17,413 --> 00:52:19,711
And some of the shoes are not at home
since the people have gone out.

968
00:52:19,916 --> 00:52:21,713
When they come back,
we will give you those too.

969
00:52:23,252 --> 00:52:25,880
Are you going to be a collector
that you are studying?

970
00:52:26,088 --> 00:52:26,713
Do some work!

971
00:52:27,256 --> 00:52:29,053
No, no. This won't do.

972
00:52:29,258 --> 00:52:31,726
Each person has to do his own work.

973
00:52:31,928 --> 00:52:33,054
And that too within deadlines set.

974
00:52:33,262 --> 00:52:35,730
Or else one gets beaten up
with dog-chains.

975
00:52:36,165 --> 00:52:37,723
Okay? Is this how it is!

976
00:52:37,934 --> 00:52:39,902
Then I will finish the work
within the time given.

977
00:52:40,169 --> 00:52:44,071
Finish this work quickly so that
you can be given other work.

978
00:52:45,274 --> 00:52:48,903
Am I a genie from a bottle?

979
00:52:51,447 --> 00:52:52,414
Okay, tell me.

980
00:52:52,949 --> 00:52:56,578
Amongst both of you who knows
to wash clothes properly?

981
00:52:57,286 --> 00:53:01,245
'One more job.
This I won't do it at all.'

982
00:53:05,962 --> 00:53:09,090
I wash clothes very well.
He doesn't know it at all.

983
00:53:09,298 --> 00:53:10,094
I will teach him.

984
00:53:10,299 --> 00:53:11,596
No, no. Clothes are expensive.

985
00:53:12,134 --> 00:53:13,431
If the person who doesn't know to
wash clothes does it...

986
00:53:13,636 --> 00:53:14,432
...then the clothes will tear.

987
00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:17,264
So? - You only will have to do this job.

988
00:53:21,811 --> 00:53:23,278
One day you will die coughing.

989
00:53:27,984 --> 00:53:28,951
Where is the place to wash clothes?

990
00:53:45,334 --> 00:53:46,301
Tell me one thing.

991
00:53:46,669 --> 00:53:49,137
Haven't the people over here washed
their clothes since 2 years?

992
00:53:49,338 --> 00:53:52,466
Hey! Don't waste your time
in futile things.

993
00:53:52,708 --> 00:53:54,300
Others are also getting their clothes.

994
00:53:55,511 --> 00:53:58,139
Let them get it! Let them get the
clothes of the entire house.

995
00:53:58,347 --> 00:54:00,474
And also ask the neighbours
to get their clothes.

996
00:54:00,683 --> 00:54:02,310
This is a cheap and good soap, right?

997
00:54:02,518 --> 00:54:04,145
That's why you are making me work so much.

998
00:54:10,926 --> 00:54:12,325
Is this a skirt or some tent cloth?

999
00:54:13,029 --> 00:54:14,997
Hey you actor! - Call me Natwar!

1000
00:54:15,364 --> 00:54:18,492
Tell me one thing. How many families
stay in this house?

1001
00:54:18,701 --> 00:54:19,668
15 to 16 families.

1002
00:54:19,869 --> 00:54:21,837
So why do you call it a house?
Call it a district.

1003
00:54:22,038 --> 00:54:24,006
Do your work. Or else I will
hang you from the rope.

1004
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,347
Which demon does this 'Kurta' belong to?

1005
00:54:32,548 --> 00:54:34,345
It belongs to our Master.

1006
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:37,510
This means there is a
master demon too?

1007
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:41,679
Hey! Speak softly. They are nothing.

1008
00:54:41,891 --> 00:54:44,519
He is the actual boss.
Mangal Singh Chauhan.

1009
00:54:44,727 --> 00:54:46,354
He has gone to Gujarat.
He must be on his way.

1010
00:54:49,565 --> 00:54:52,193
Come on! Come on!
Come and have your meal!

1011
00:54:52,401 --> 00:54:56,701
What? Dig? I am not going to dig!
I also know a little bit of Gujarati.

1012
00:54:57,073 --> 00:54:59,871
Don't you want to eat?
- No! - No? - No!

1013
00:55:00,076 --> 00:55:02,374
Then you go to hell!
- You go to hell!

1014
00:55:03,079 --> 00:55:04,706
Hey, go! You don't understand Gujarati.

1015
00:55:04,914 --> 00:55:06,211
Go and dig.

1016
00:55:06,415 --> 00:55:07,882
When you will do a lot of hard work,
then you will come to know!

1017
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:08,716
Here I am having a tough time washing...

1018
00:55:08,918 --> 00:55:10,545
...clothes and to top it all
they want me to dig!

1019
00:55:10,753 --> 00:55:12,550
I am a worker who works endlessly.

1020
00:55:12,755 --> 00:55:15,053
Do you know what he meant?

1021
00:55:15,257 --> 00:55:16,383
He was calling you to eat food.

1022
00:55:16,592 --> 00:55:18,890
What? - Now you go and do your work.
- What food?

1023
00:55:19,095 --> 00:55:22,394
Yes, there is bean vegetable, bread and
for sweets there is 'ghungra'.

1024
00:55:22,598 --> 00:55:26,398
There is 'choli', 'sabzi'
and what else?

1025
00:55:26,602 --> 00:55:27,899
Bread. - Bread?

1026
00:55:28,604 --> 00:55:30,401
And what is there for sweets?

1027
00:55:30,606 --> 00:55:35,407
What do they call it in Gujarati?
Ghungra. No, ghagra. Ghungra.

1028
00:55:40,616 --> 00:55:42,584
I was thinking of something else.

1029
00:55:42,785 --> 00:55:43,752
Now nothing can happen.

1030
00:55:44,453 --> 00:55:47,081
This is the rule of this house that
if one person refuses...

1031
00:55:47,289 --> 00:55:48,586
...in this house for the first time
then he doesn't get food again.

1032
00:55:48,824 --> 00:55:50,416
Oh God! What injustice is this?

1033
00:55:50,626 --> 00:55:51,923
I do all the work and
he eats the food.

1034
00:55:52,128 --> 00:55:53,254
Now nothing can be possible?

1035
00:55:53,629 --> 00:55:56,757
It is possible that after everyone
finishes then whatever is left.

1036
00:55:56,966 --> 00:55:58,763
I will tell them then they will call you.

1037
00:55:58,968 --> 00:55:59,935
Do something. Do something.

1038
00:56:00,136 --> 00:56:01,933
Hey! Get up! Go and wash clothes!

1039
00:56:03,038 --> 00:56:04,266
He is wetting my pants.

1040
00:56:08,477 --> 00:56:10,775
Hey! What are you doing?
Have you gone mad?

1041
00:56:13,482 --> 00:56:16,940
Suddenly I remembered my boss.
That's why I lost my senses.

1042
00:56:17,153 --> 00:56:19,621
Foolish! This is not
your boss's clothes.

1043
00:56:19,822 --> 00:56:21,790
This is the dress of
master's only sister.

1044
00:56:22,057 --> 00:56:25,288
If they even tear a little then
master will not spare you.

1045
00:56:36,672 --> 00:56:37,798
Hey!

1046
00:56:40,543 --> 00:56:41,475
What do you want?

1047
00:56:41,744 --> 00:56:42,642
I don't know Gujarati.

1048
00:56:42,845 --> 00:56:44,972
That's why when they called me
for food I didn't go.

1049
00:56:45,181 --> 00:56:48,309
Can I get a little food?
- What? - Shoe?

1050
00:56:48,684 --> 00:56:50,652
Shoe? Yes, I polished shoes
long time back.

1051
00:56:50,853 --> 00:56:51,820
And I have also washed the clothes.

1052
00:56:52,521 --> 00:56:54,819
Can I get... what did that guy tell me?

1053
00:56:55,691 --> 00:56:59,650
Can I get ghagro (skirt) and
choli (blouse)? - What?

1054
00:56:59,862 --> 00:57:02,831
A blouse and a skirt?
- Yes, a blouse and a skirt.

1055
00:57:03,098 --> 00:57:06,158
Whose do you want? You give me.
You give me.

1056
00:57:06,435 --> 00:57:08,995
You shameless guy!
You want my skirt and blouse?

1057
00:57:09,205 --> 00:57:10,832
Yes, I want.

1058
00:57:11,106 --> 00:57:13,666
Oh no! - If you don't mind
then I will take it myself.

1059
00:57:14,210 --> 00:57:16,007
Uncle! Come soon! Come soon!

1060
00:57:16,245 --> 00:57:17,678
Papa, come soon!

1061
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:18,505
What happened?

1062
00:57:19,048 --> 00:57:21,346
He is saying that he wants
my skirt and blouse.

1063
00:57:21,550 --> 00:57:22,847
Yes, I want it.

1064
00:57:23,219 --> 00:57:24,345
You give me. Give me.

1065
00:57:24,587 --> 00:57:27,181
Hit him! Hit him!

1066
00:57:30,125 --> 00:57:32,025
Definitely you must have
done something.

1067
00:57:32,228 --> 00:57:33,695
That's why you are in such a state.

1068
00:57:33,896 --> 00:57:35,693
This is good that I reached
at the right time.

1069
00:57:35,898 --> 00:57:38,526
Or else they would beat you up...

1070
00:57:38,734 --> 00:57:39,701
...and cooked you for dinner.

1071
00:57:39,902 --> 00:57:42,370
Sit. - What kind of people are these?

1072
00:57:42,571 --> 00:57:45,039
They only make me work from
morning till evening.

1073
00:57:45,241 --> 00:57:46,538
They don't even give food.

1074
00:57:49,411 --> 00:57:51,208
He is also sitting here.

1075
00:57:56,752 --> 00:57:58,379
Did you get the news?

1076
00:57:58,587 --> 00:58:01,556
They beat me up very badly
in the kitchen.

1077
00:58:04,593 --> 00:58:06,220
Yes. Even there they beat me.

1078
00:58:09,164 --> 00:58:10,722
Why are you crying?
Now don't go anywhere.

1079
00:58:10,966 --> 00:58:13,560
Yes. Sit here. Sit.

1080
00:58:14,103 --> 00:58:16,571
You will get it here only.
- What? Beating? - No, food.

1081
00:58:18,107 --> 00:58:20,735
Take this. Take this plate.
Give him.

1082
00:58:32,521 --> 00:58:34,079
Which animals skin this is?

1083
00:58:34,290 --> 00:58:37,748
This is bread.
- How can I eat just this?

1084
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:39,427
I need something with this.

1085
00:58:40,129 --> 00:58:41,096
Can I get pickle?

1086
00:58:41,297 --> 00:58:43,288
Do you want 4 of them? - Yes.

1087
00:58:43,499 --> 00:58:47,663
Take these 4. 1, 2. 3 and 4.

1088
00:58:47,870 --> 00:58:51,203
What is this? Yuck! - 5 and 6.

1089
00:58:58,614 --> 00:58:59,638
Did you wash your hands?

1090
00:59:00,482 --> 00:59:03,110
Since 24 hours I have been washing clothes
and that too with soap.

1091
00:59:03,319 --> 00:59:06,447
And should I wash my hands for this food?
- Dirty guy!

1092
00:59:10,225 --> 00:59:12,591
Can I get a saw to cut it?

1093
00:59:12,795 --> 00:59:15,923
Thank God that today the bread is softer
as compared to the other days.

1094
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:19,267
So are these those 2 fools
who have come to work?

1095
00:59:19,568 --> 00:59:21,695
The boys are good. Very hard working.

1096
00:59:21,904 --> 00:59:24,031
Do they give only so much to eat?
Is it?

1097
00:59:24,506 --> 00:59:26,701
So should we get you food
from 5 star hotels?

1098
00:59:26,909 --> 00:59:27,898
Eat quickly and get to work.

1099
00:59:28,110 --> 00:59:31,978
No, no. I am not used to eating
such strong and rigid food.

1100
00:59:32,348 --> 00:59:34,441
Look at him. How quietly
he is eating food!

1101
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:36,447
Give anything to him.
He will eat it quietly.

1102
00:59:36,652 --> 00:59:38,711
And if you tell him anything then
he won't even listen. - Why?

1103
00:59:38,921 --> 00:59:41,048
Is he dumb and deaf?
- Yes, he is dumb and deaf.

1104
00:59:41,256 --> 00:59:43,656
But he is not proud of it at all.

1105
00:59:54,103 --> 00:59:56,264
He is asking for buttermilk.
- He is asking forte.

1106
00:59:56,472 --> 00:59:58,440
Yes, he is asking forte.

1107
01:00:00,542 --> 01:00:02,100
Whatever you get, get 2 of them.

1108
01:00:03,846 --> 01:00:07,805
Is she the madam you were
talking about? - No!

1109
01:00:08,017 --> 01:00:11,680
She is also a madam. But above her
there is one more madam.

1110
01:00:11,887 --> 01:00:12,785
Like him.

1111
01:00:15,024 --> 01:00:16,252
Why? Does she eat a lot?

1112
01:00:16,458 --> 01:00:20,792
No. She can't speak.
But she can hear.

1113
01:00:28,837 --> 01:00:30,361
Shruti! Shruti! Shruti!

1114
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:33,935
Shruti, come with me.
I have to show you something.

1115
01:00:34,410 --> 01:00:36,742
Come with me for a minute.
I want you to meet a man.

1116
01:00:36,945 --> 01:00:38,378
Come. Come with me!

1117
01:00:40,282 --> 01:00:41,146
See this.

1118
01:00:43,085 --> 01:00:45,144
Neither he can hear nor speak.

1119
01:00:49,191 --> 01:00:51,751
But it doesn't seem that
he is either dumb or deaf.

1120
01:01:01,837 --> 01:01:03,065
You fool!

1121
01:01:03,272 --> 01:01:05,240
I am getting to eat animal skin, and that too
you are not able to tolerate.

1122
01:01:05,441 --> 01:01:07,409
I will kill you today.

1123
01:01:07,609 --> 01:01:09,406
Wait! Wait, you scoundrel! Wait!

1124
01:01:19,354 --> 01:01:20,184
Come here. Come here.

1125
01:01:20,389 --> 01:01:23,085
Sir, please forgive me. I didn't see you.

1126
01:01:23,292 --> 01:01:26,921
If you didn't see me then how did you
aim right under my eye?

1127
01:01:27,129 --> 01:01:30,530
No, no. I was hitting him.
- Whom? - Him.

1128
01:01:30,999 --> 01:01:32,933
This poor chap who is dumb.

1129
01:01:33,302 --> 01:01:33,996
Wait! Wait!

1130
01:01:35,437 --> 01:01:37,268
Now I will show you the fun.

1131
01:01:37,473 --> 01:01:39,532
Wait! Hold this. Hold this!

1132
01:01:39,741 --> 01:01:41,208
Now you hit him.

1133
01:01:43,479 --> 01:01:45,947
And listen, it should hit him here only.
Hit him!

1134
01:01:46,148 --> 01:01:47,615
You dumb guy! I am your brother.

1135
01:01:47,816 --> 01:01:49,044
Hey! Now hit me!

1136
01:01:49,651 --> 01:01:50,379
Hit him!

1137
01:02:09,238 --> 01:02:11,365
Whatever happens, it's always
Mangal Mangal Mangal.

1138
01:02:11,573 --> 01:02:14,565
Do you people also think about anything
apart from Mangal?

1139
01:02:14,776 --> 01:02:18,803
Mangal is not your elder brother.
He is the son of your elder brother.

1140
01:02:19,014 --> 01:02:22,415
I agree that he is the son of
my elder brother.

1141
01:02:22,851 --> 01:02:25,843
But he means more to me than
my elder brother.

1142
01:02:26,622 --> 01:02:28,988
Whatever he says will be the law in...

1143
01:02:29,191 --> 01:02:31,557
...this house and everyone will have
to follow it. Even you.

1144
01:02:32,594 --> 01:02:33,151
Hey! Uncle!

1145
01:02:33,362 --> 01:02:36,058
Wait! Stop all this!
Is this a place to play?

1146
01:02:36,798 --> 01:02:37,924
Why? What happened?

1147
01:02:38,133 --> 01:02:40,363
What if your legs break?
- Then we will get it plastered.

1148
01:02:40,569 --> 01:02:42,196
One can plaster your leg, but I can't...

1149
01:02:42,404 --> 01:02:44,304
...plaster the tent if anything
happens to it.

1150
01:02:44,506 --> 01:02:46,167
All these things are mine.
I can come here whenever I want.

1151
01:02:46,375 --> 01:02:46,966
Understood?

1152
01:02:47,176 --> 01:02:48,507
Hey! Go away! - Why should I go?

1153
01:02:48,710 --> 01:02:49,438
Come on now, go!

1154
01:02:52,714 --> 01:02:53,578
Cut carefully!

1155
01:02:53,782 --> 01:02:55,647
They had asked you to cut plants.
What are you cutting?

1156
01:02:55,851 --> 01:02:56,783
If you are going to stand in front
then it will get cut.

1157
01:02:56,985 --> 01:02:57,451
Go away!

1158
01:02:59,354 --> 01:03:00,878
What happened?
- That is what I am asking.

1159
01:03:01,089 --> 01:03:02,181
What is happening here?

1160
01:03:02,391 --> 01:03:03,358
What do you want?

1161
01:03:03,559 --> 01:03:05,618
If I have tied it then
I only will take it away.

1162
01:03:05,827 --> 01:03:07,624
Leave this. This I have tied.

1163
01:03:07,829 --> 01:03:09,387
I am not talking about this.

1164
01:03:09,598 --> 01:03:10,963
You very well know that and even
the members of the family know...

1165
01:03:11,166 --> 01:03:14,329
...that as soon as the marriage
takes place I take it and go.

1166
01:03:14,903 --> 01:03:16,461
Hey sir! What happened?

1167
01:03:17,339 --> 01:03:19,830
Sir, I was saying that...
- He lengthened my tie.

1168
01:03:20,409 --> 01:03:22,877
What did he tie? - He had tied it
for the marriage.

1169
01:03:23,078 --> 01:03:25,205
For whose marriage?
- Shruti madam's marriage.

1170
01:03:25,414 --> 01:03:28,406
Okay! So he is Shruti's husband. - Hey!

1171
01:03:28,617 --> 01:03:29,709
What nonsense are you talking?

1172
01:03:29,918 --> 01:03:30,407
Will you get me killed?

1173
01:03:30,619 --> 01:03:32,985
Wasn't he yelling and saying that
he has tied it?

1174
01:03:33,188 --> 01:03:35,918
What he meant that he has tied the...

1175
01:03:36,124 --> 01:03:37,716
...tent of the marriage he hasn't
married Shruti! - What?

1176
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:40,760
Is this a tent?
I thought this was a house?

1177
01:03:41,530 --> 01:03:42,997
In your village do your houses
look like this?

1178
01:03:43,198 --> 01:03:44,187
Donkey!

1179
01:03:44,399 --> 01:03:47,425
This is not a house. This is a palace.

1180
01:03:47,636 --> 01:03:50,036
It was senior sir's order that the house
should be decorated like a palace.

1181
01:03:50,239 --> 01:03:51,729
It is Shruti madam's marriage, right?

1182
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:52,702
When is the marriage?

1183
01:03:52,908 --> 01:03:54,341
The date of marriage has passed by.

1184
01:03:54,543 --> 01:03:56,977
The day the marriage was there,
that day it was broken.

1185
01:03:57,179 --> 01:04:00,239
It is very sad that the marriage is
broken on the marriage day itself.

1186
01:04:00,449 --> 01:04:02,383
The marriage was broken
in this wedding tent...

1187
01:04:02,584 --> 01:04:04,449
...and in this tent only the marriage
will take place.

1188
01:04:04,653 --> 01:04:07,349
This promise was taken by Mangal
in this tent itself.

1189
01:04:07,556 --> 01:04:10,684
Without my consent who is he to have
taken an oath in my tent?

1190
01:04:10,892 --> 01:04:13,292
Will he take an oath by asking you?

1191
01:04:13,795 --> 01:04:16,559
Don't talk too much!
You are getting the rent, right?

1192
01:04:16,798 --> 01:04:18,766
See sir, don't entrap me.

1193
01:04:19,067 --> 01:04:21,160
I already have 2 to 3 marriages and a
festival at a temple to handle.

1194
01:04:21,370 --> 01:04:22,769
I have taken advance for all of them.

1195
01:04:22,971 --> 01:04:24,962
I have to dismantle this tent from here
and put it there.

1196
01:04:25,173 --> 01:04:29,132
If you touch this tent then
I will break your hands.

1197
01:04:29,344 --> 01:04:30,971
Are you jesting or are you
speaking the truth?

1198
01:04:31,179 --> 01:04:32,271
I am speaking the truth.

1199
01:04:32,547 --> 01:04:35,539
Then it is fine. Otherwise I don't like
these kind of jokes.

1200
01:04:35,751 --> 01:04:36,445
Yes!

1201
01:04:37,653 --> 01:04:40,884
And yes, if that female never gets married...

1202
01:04:41,089 --> 01:04:42,454
...then for God's sake don't tell me to...

1203
01:04:42,658 --> 01:04:46,185
...leave this tent as a
wedding memento for her.

1204
01:04:56,571 --> 01:04:59,131
When Mangal brother took an oath...

1205
01:04:59,441 --> 01:05:01,807
...then every member of the house took an
oath that till Shruti...

1206
01:05:02,110 --> 01:05:08,481
...doesn't get married till then no one
in the house will get married.

1207
01:05:08,684 --> 01:05:10,083
Why won't they get married?

1208
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:12,646
That was good.

1209
01:05:12,854 --> 01:05:13,980
Otherwise I wouldn't be capable of...

1210
01:05:14,189 --> 01:05:15,884
...marriage by washing the marriage clothes.

1211
01:05:16,091 --> 01:05:20,653
But I want this marriage to
take place at any cost.

1212
01:05:21,063 --> 01:05:23,190
Otherwise when will I get married?

1213
01:05:23,999 --> 01:05:27,491
According to your age there is only one
female who is worth for you.

1214
01:05:27,703 --> 01:05:29,500
That moustache guy's wife.

1215
01:05:29,871 --> 01:05:33,602
But for her you will have to get rid
of that moustache guy!

1216
01:05:33,809 --> 01:05:36,004
Hey! Stop talking nonsense!

1217
01:05:37,045 --> 01:05:40,481
I like Rupa! Rupa! - Rupa?

1218
01:05:40,716 --> 01:05:41,683
What is Rupa?

1219
01:05:41,883 --> 01:05:43,009
Will you get married to a vest?

1220
01:05:43,218 --> 01:05:46,676
Shut up! She is not a vest.
She wears a skirt and a top.

1221
01:05:46,888 --> 01:05:48,287
Who is in the kitchen making breads...

1222
01:05:48,490 --> 01:05:50,549
Who had got you beaten up!

1223
01:05:50,759 --> 01:05:53,489
Hey! Stop talking nonsense.
Make my drink!

1224
01:05:53,695 --> 01:05:57,927
Don't yell! Don't yell!
I am making. Don't talk.

1225
01:06:20,222 --> 01:06:22,588
I think I am very high!

1226
01:06:22,791 --> 01:06:26,124
That's why I can hear different
kind of voices.

1227
01:06:26,328 --> 01:06:29,024
Hey you shorty!
Either you drink or go to sleep!

1228
01:06:29,231 --> 01:06:31,028
I will go to sleep.

1229
01:06:55,056 --> 01:06:56,683
Hey! Go to sleep!

1230
01:07:03,732 --> 01:07:07,498
What is going on? - Shut up, you dog!
Go to sleep.

1231
01:07:18,013 --> 01:07:18,672
Hey!

1232
01:07:20,015 --> 01:07:21,004
Hey!

1233
01:07:25,487 --> 01:07:27,512
There is no one over here
to listen to me.

1234
01:07:28,990 --> 01:07:30,582
I want to speak.

1235
01:07:31,326 --> 01:07:33,794
Since so many months I haven't
heard my own voice.

1236
01:07:35,263 --> 01:07:36,628
Is anyone there?

1237
01:08:02,157 --> 01:08:06,594
"The season is a slayer."

1238
01:08:07,596 --> 01:08:11,589
"I hope that this disloyal heart
doesn't get lost somewhere."

1239
01:08:14,836 --> 01:08:19,170
"There is a huge dilemma."

1240
01:08:20,141 --> 01:08:24,475
"I hope that this disloyal heart
doesn't get lost somewhere."

1241
01:08:27,516 --> 01:08:30,781
"Neither is there peace nor is
there any tranquillity."

1242
01:08:30,986 --> 01:08:34,422
"For whom I am waiting for?"

1243
01:08:34,623 --> 01:08:38,115
"For whom I am waiting for?"

1244
01:08:38,326 --> 01:08:42,422
"The season is a slayer."

1245
01:08:43,665 --> 01:08:47,726
"I hope that this disloyal heart
doesn't get lost somewhere."

1246
01:08:57,245 --> 01:09:00,544
"In the laughter of the moon I must
sway in it's moonlight."

1247
01:09:00,749 --> 01:09:04,207
"I must sway in the captivating light."

1248
01:09:04,419 --> 01:09:06,819
"In the laughter of the moon I must
sway in it's moonlight."

1249
01:09:07,022 --> 01:09:11,550
"I must sway in the captivating light."

1250
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:13,227
"If not in love..."

1251
01:09:34,215 --> 01:09:38,174
So you can't speak but can sing!

1252
01:09:40,322 --> 01:09:42,517
Stop it. Tell me why did you do this drama?

1253
01:09:44,292 --> 01:09:47,693
I know how to get you speaking. Come on.

1254
01:09:47,896 --> 01:09:48,692
Madam...

1255
01:09:52,734 --> 01:09:54,497
Where is he gone? - I am down here.

1256
01:09:56,071 --> 01:09:57,197
At your feet.

1257
01:10:00,342 --> 01:10:05,507
The fact is that I can speak and
hear too at times.

1258
01:10:06,414 --> 01:10:10,407
I am a dumb guy of a different sort.

1259
01:10:16,191 --> 01:10:20,389
To tell you the truth...
I have only one kidney.

1260
01:10:21,963 --> 01:10:24,397
Then why are you dumb?
Is your kidney in your mouth?

1261
01:10:24,733 --> 01:10:29,898
No... the doctor said that
I should not work.

1262
01:10:30,472 --> 01:10:32,633
Or I might get a heart attack.

1263
01:10:33,074 --> 01:10:36,339
So my uncle advised me to act dumb...

1264
01:10:36,845 --> 01:10:40,611
...so as to escape work and
also win some sympathy.

1265
01:10:40,815 --> 01:10:45,582
Please let me stay here till my uncle
returns with the money.

1266
01:10:46,888 --> 01:10:51,188
You can't understand the pain of a guy
with just one kidney.

1267
01:10:58,767 --> 01:11:00,598
If anyone else comes to know this truth...

1268
01:11:01,269 --> 01:11:04,170
...then I shall ensure that no Gujarati
in this house gets to drink even water.

1269
01:11:04,372 --> 01:11:05,896
What!? And how will you do that?

1270
01:11:07,242 --> 01:11:09,676
I will consume poison, jump into this
well and kill myself.

1271
01:11:20,889 --> 01:11:23,687
Ok, we are letting you off this time.

1272
01:11:23,892 --> 01:11:26,861
But if anyone else in this house learns
the truth about you...

1273
01:11:27,062 --> 01:11:31,021
...then you will end up losing your other
kidney too. Got it? Go now.

1274
01:11:49,584 --> 01:11:50,243
What is it?

1275
01:11:51,853 --> 01:11:55,755
Last night I dreamt of something.
- What kind of dream?

1276
01:11:55,957 --> 01:11:58,949
In the dream I saw that the three of us...

1277
01:12:00,628 --> 01:12:01,652
...were sitting together and drinking alcohol.

1278
01:12:01,863 --> 01:12:05,993
And this dumb guy spoke.

1279
01:12:10,438 --> 01:12:16,502
Shut up, you dog! Didn't he say
the same thing? - Yes.

1280
01:12:19,681 --> 01:12:20,739
But how do you know...

1281
01:12:20,949 --> 01:12:22,280
...what he was saying in my dream?

1282
01:12:22,484 --> 01:12:24,281
You only said that all three of us were...

1283
01:12:24,486 --> 01:12:25,817
...sitting together and drinking
alcohol in the dream.

1284
01:12:26,020 --> 01:12:27,487
Then even I will hear. Am I deaf?

1285
01:12:27,689 --> 01:12:28,849
Yes!

1286
01:12:29,891 --> 01:12:31,916
I am also so foolish!

1287
01:12:33,962 --> 01:12:38,922
But in your dream... - I understood.
Understood.

1288
01:12:55,817 --> 01:13:00,379
"It has come. It has come.
The message has come".

1289
01:13:00,588 --> 01:13:04,991
What message? - "The message has come. >>

1290
01:13:05,193 --> 01:13:09,960
See this. Shruti dear's marriage
has been fixed.

1291
01:13:10,398 --> 01:13:12,059
Mangal has sent the fax.

1292
01:13:12,267 --> 01:13:14,531
Shruti madam, your marriage
has been fixed! - Hey!

1293
01:13:15,236 --> 01:13:16,066
Softly!

1294
01:13:16,604 --> 01:13:19,266
First we will take sweets and go
and then we will tell her.

1295
01:13:19,474 --> 01:13:20,907
Come on. - Come on. Yes, come.

1296
01:13:27,849 --> 01:13:29,043
Shruti dear!

1297
01:13:37,125 --> 01:13:40,424
Shruti dear! Whatever you like
from this take it.

1298
01:13:40,628 --> 01:13:42,289
I have to give you good news.

1299
01:13:48,469 --> 01:13:51,404
She is asking how much of our property
have they asked in dowry?

1300
01:13:52,807 --> 01:13:55,901
Don't worry about that, dear.
That Mangal will handle.

1301
01:13:56,110 --> 01:13:57,236
Here. Have the sweet.

1302
01:13:57,445 --> 01:13:58,605
Take it, dear.

1303
01:14:06,054 --> 01:14:07,385
They have asked for 2 Ahmedabad...

1304
01:14:07,589 --> 01:14:09,853
...companies and a lot of
property over here.

1305
01:14:10,058 --> 01:14:13,516
So this is clear that they don't want Shruti
but they want her wealth.

1306
01:14:13,728 --> 01:14:15,025
So what is wrong in that?

1307
01:14:15,997 --> 01:14:18,295
The tradition of dowry is on since ages.

1308
01:14:18,499 --> 01:14:19,796
It's not a new thing.

1309
01:14:20,001 --> 01:14:23,801
Once they get the property then
she will be just a burden.

1310
01:14:24,005 --> 01:14:25,996
And Shruti doesn't want to be a burden.

1311
01:14:26,207 --> 01:14:27,299
Because of this reason should we make...

1312
01:14:27,508 --> 01:14:30,136
...Shruti madam sit at home
throughout her life.

1313
01:14:31,179 --> 01:14:32,373
Mangal must have thought of something...

1314
01:14:32,580 --> 01:14:33,911
...and given consent
for the marriage, right?

1315
01:14:34,115 --> 01:14:38,677
Correct! Mangal won't take any
decision without thinking.

1316
01:14:38,887 --> 01:14:41,378
He has only lived his
entire life for you.

1317
01:14:41,589 --> 01:14:44,581
Shruti, you must agree to your brother.

1318
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:46,549
Why don't you all understand?

1319
01:14:46,761 --> 01:14:48,285
She doesn't like all this.

1320
01:14:49,097 --> 01:14:50,428
See, we all know that
whatever decision...

1321
01:14:50,632 --> 01:14:53,795
...Mangal takes only that
happens in this house.

1322
01:14:54,102 --> 01:14:57,071
Then it is better for all of us
to agree to what he says.

1323
01:14:58,373 --> 01:14:59,635
Shruti!

1324
01:15:00,341 --> 01:15:01,239
Hey!

1325
01:15:03,444 --> 01:15:06,845
What is this? Is this the time
to cry? Come on!

1326
01:15:07,048 --> 01:15:08,640
Now your marriage has not
taken place, right?

1327
01:15:08,850 --> 01:15:10,784
Come on. Get up! Get up!

1328
01:15:23,731 --> 01:15:26,393
Me? And talk to your brother?

1329
01:15:26,601 --> 01:15:27,829
Have I lost my senses?

1330
01:15:28,670 --> 01:15:32,106
Let anyone tell him anything
but he won't understand.

1331
01:15:32,307 --> 01:15:34,275
Everyone knows that his love for you...

1332
01:15:34,475 --> 01:15:36,500
...has increased so much that
he has gone mad.

1333
01:15:38,146 --> 01:15:40,341
Hey! But you don't worry.

1334
01:15:40,648 --> 01:15:42,138
Your brother won't come to know.

1335
01:15:42,350 --> 01:15:43,908
...and even this marriage
will not work out.

1336
01:15:44,118 --> 01:15:45,847
I have a plan for that.

1337
01:15:49,290 --> 01:15:50,120
Hey!

1338
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:52,854
Come here!

1339
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:00,124
Tell me. What is it?

1340
01:16:00,335 --> 01:16:02,166
What kind of clothes have you worn?

1341
01:16:03,404 --> 01:16:05,964
This... this is that body builder's 'kurta'.

1342
01:16:06,174 --> 01:16:07,641
I wear it as a nightdress.

1343
01:16:07,942 --> 01:16:10,069
Why did you call me? - Take this.

1344
01:16:12,847 --> 01:16:13,939
Why are you showing your teeth?

1345
01:16:14,282 --> 01:16:17,945
I... that... I don't accept
love letters. I feel shy.

1346
01:16:18,152 --> 01:16:20,882
I will hit you one! Talks of love letters.
Take this!

1347
01:16:21,189 --> 01:16:25,319
What is this? - It is written in Hindi.
- That even I understand.

1348
01:16:26,427 --> 01:16:27,985
I am Shruti's lover...

1349
01:16:28,196 --> 01:16:30,756
It is a message. - We have to send it
across to Gujarat.

1350
01:16:31,699 --> 01:16:33,189
But I don't have so much time with...

1351
01:16:33,401 --> 01:16:34,163
...me that I will give it
till Gujarat and come.

1352
01:16:34,369 --> 01:16:35,996
You don't need to go to Gujarat.

1353
01:16:36,204 --> 01:16:38,502
Just once if your voice reaches Gujarat.
That is enough.

1354
01:16:38,706 --> 01:16:39,934
Take this. - My voice...

1355
01:16:43,211 --> 01:16:45,679
Not this voice. Read it in your
original voice.

1356
01:16:49,484 --> 01:16:52,476
Hello, I am Jaichand Rathod.
Who are you?

1357
01:16:53,788 --> 01:16:55,119
Some Jaichand Rathod is there.
You speak.

1358
01:16:55,323 --> 01:16:58,121
You read. - Okay. - Read.

1359
01:16:58,526 --> 01:17:01,893
Hello. I am Shruti's lover speaking.

1360
01:17:02,096 --> 01:17:03,529
Okay? - Speak properly.

1361
01:17:03,831 --> 01:17:07,460
We are in love since 2 years.

1362
01:17:08,136 --> 01:17:12,072
We can't live without each other.

1363
01:17:12,507 --> 01:17:21,142
And whoever comes in between and
tries to marry Shruti then...

1364
01:17:22,083 --> 01:17:26,747
...you will get to see both our
dead bodies on the wedding dais.

1365
01:17:26,954 --> 01:17:29,013
Did you understand? - What!

1366
01:17:30,725 --> 01:17:32,590
Hey you loud mouth!
Will you wake up everyone?

1367
01:17:32,794 --> 01:17:34,261
Sorry. Who is he?

1368
01:17:34,462 --> 01:17:36,259
He is Shruti's to-be husband.

1369
01:17:36,464 --> 01:17:38,227
Okay. So what did I tell him?

1370
01:17:38,566 --> 01:17:40,898
That you and Shruti are lovers.
- Is it?

1371
01:17:41,269 --> 01:17:44,136
And you both are having
an affair since 2 years.

1372
01:17:44,605 --> 01:17:47,699
And both of you can't live
without each other. - Is it?

1373
01:17:47,909 --> 01:17:50,901
And if Jaichand and Shruti get married
to each other then he...

1374
01:17:51,112 --> 01:17:52,170
...will find both of your dead bodies
on this wedding dais.

1375
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:53,005
What!

1376
01:17:53,214 --> 01:17:54,681
Then their marriage will be broken.

1377
01:17:54,882 --> 01:17:56,008
Yes, of course it will be broken.

1378
01:17:56,217 --> 01:17:57,411
And only you will be responsible for this.

1379
01:17:57,618 --> 01:17:59,916
Hey see! This is a sin.

1380
01:18:00,121 --> 01:18:02,146
Now stop all this here itself!

1381
01:18:02,356 --> 01:18:06,087
Because if anyone gets to know that
you can speak then you will be...

1382
01:18:06,961 --> 01:18:07,757
Hey! Listen!

1383
01:18:09,063 --> 01:18:09,688
Me?

1384
01:18:40,828 --> 01:18:41,658
No one is there.

1385
01:18:46,067 --> 01:18:47,557
Have you sent this message?

1386
01:18:47,768 --> 01:18:50,396
In our place we don't get message
but Gujarati news.

1387
01:18:50,605 --> 01:18:51,765
No, no.

1388
01:18:51,973 --> 01:18:55,306
I am talking about love messages
not about newspaper.

1389
01:18:55,510 --> 01:18:56,738
What are you talking about?

1390
01:18:56,978 --> 01:19:00,641
I know about Chocobar,
Beer Bar, Birbal Akbar.

1391
01:19:00,982 --> 01:19:02,313
I don't know about what you are saying!

1392
01:19:02,550 --> 01:19:06,316
See, if you want to write a love letter...

1393
01:19:06,521 --> 01:19:09,786
...then write in the language that
I will understand.

1394
01:19:09,991 --> 01:19:10,753
What?

1395
01:19:10,992 --> 01:19:15,622
I mean that now I will read this.
You explain me the meaning of this.

1396
01:19:15,830 --> 01:19:16,660
Okay?

1397
01:19:17,131 --> 01:19:18,598
It is the cooker!

1398
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:20,089
In the light.

1399
01:19:20,535 --> 01:19:22,332
I am Shruti's lover speaking.

1400
01:19:22,537 --> 01:19:24,061
We are in love since 2 years.

1401
01:19:24,272 --> 01:19:26,433
We can't live without each other.

1402
01:19:26,641 --> 01:19:29,838
And whoever comes in between
and tries to...

1403
01:19:30,044 --> 01:19:31,068
What did you say, you donkey!

1404
01:19:32,547 --> 01:19:34,310
Hey! Where are you running
with the letter! Wait!

1405
01:19:34,515 --> 01:19:36,949
Hey, Kanhaiya! I am saying wait!

1406
01:19:37,151 --> 01:19:38,618
Give it to me back or else
I won't spare you!

1407
01:19:38,819 --> 01:19:42,585
That is my love letter. For the first time
someone has written it to me.

1408
01:19:42,790 --> 01:19:44,781
Hey, return that back!

1409
01:19:44,992 --> 01:19:46,186
That is... Kanhaiya!

1410
01:20:02,243 --> 01:20:04,541
Who are you? Who are you!

1411
01:20:08,282 --> 01:20:09,749
Why did you do like this?

1412
01:20:27,265 --> 01:20:29,096
Brother, you don't hit him. Please!

1413
01:20:34,605 --> 01:20:37,904
Who asked you to do this?

1414
01:20:38,309 --> 01:20:39,071
Tell me!

1415
01:20:39,844 --> 01:20:41,744
Tell me or else I will kill you!

1416
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:43,076
Tell me!

1417
01:20:45,249 --> 01:20:47,581
Mangal! Mangal! - Uncle, you don't
come in between.

1418
01:20:47,785 --> 01:20:49,685
Listen to me. This scoundrel had called up!

1419
01:20:49,887 --> 01:20:51,912
He has broken my sister's marriage.
- No!

1420
01:20:52,123 --> 01:20:54,250
He only had said that...
- Listen to me!

1421
01:20:54,458 --> 01:20:56,119
He cannot speak. He is dumb.

1422
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:11,138
He is dumb like our Shruti.

1423
01:21:13,377 --> 01:21:15,607
In the night someone threw
this letter on me.

1424
01:21:16,447 --> 01:21:20,281
He snatched this and he was
running away to tease me.

1425
01:21:41,505 --> 01:21:44,906
They broke the marriage because of
an anonymous phone call.

1426
01:21:46,210 --> 01:21:50,169
It doesn't matter if they believed
in the phone call.

1427
01:21:50,381 --> 01:21:53,111
If we transfer our export and
travel agency business on their...

1428
01:21:53,317 --> 01:21:57,253
...name then they are willing to
marry that day itself.

1429
01:21:57,455 --> 01:21:59,787
So... then have you agreed to
their conditions?

1430
01:21:59,991 --> 01:22:00,980
Yes, I did.

1431
01:22:01,392 --> 01:22:03,485
I said that I would give
whatever they asked.

1432
01:22:05,396 --> 01:22:06,761
Except my sister.

1433
01:22:11,936 --> 01:22:13,335
What do those people think?

1434
01:22:14,405 --> 01:22:15,736
Is my sister a burden on me?

1435
01:22:17,375 --> 01:22:18,842
Whom I will just throw away like that!

1436
01:22:26,417 --> 01:22:28,112
I am not worried about the money.

1437
01:22:29,587 --> 01:22:31,350
I want that you should get such a guy...

1438
01:22:32,390 --> 01:22:34,483
...who should love you and not your wealth.

1439
01:22:35,559 --> 01:22:38,824
Wherever he might be in the world
I will find him and get him.

1440
01:22:40,064 --> 01:22:41,895
And whatever he asks for
I will give him that.

1441
01:22:43,467 --> 01:22:45,935
Even my life. - Mangal!

1442
01:22:49,273 --> 01:22:50,763
Why do you worry, Mangal?

1443
01:22:52,643 --> 01:22:55,168
I had made that wedding dais
for her marriage.

1444
01:22:55,379 --> 01:22:57,540
Only on that wedding dais her
marriage will take place.

1445
01:22:58,549 --> 01:22:59,311
Yes, uncle.

1446
01:22:59,917 --> 01:23:04,354
Forgive me. I didn't know that the
situations would become like this.

1447
01:23:05,289 --> 01:23:06,449
But I knew.

1448
01:23:07,325 --> 01:23:09,793
After getting the first blow from
that body builder I understood.

1449
01:23:10,494 --> 01:23:11,620
That I am going to be in this state.

1450
01:23:11,829 --> 01:23:13,490
Now it is not advisable
for you to stay here.

1451
01:23:13,831 --> 01:23:15,492
You must go away from here tonight itself.

1452
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,368
I should go away? Where to?

1453
01:23:18,869 --> 01:23:21,531
Anywhere. If you want money
then I will give you.

1454
01:23:21,739 --> 01:23:22,467
How much will you give me?

1455
01:23:24,308 --> 01:23:27,573
Will 500 do? - What! 500?

1456
01:23:29,013 --> 01:23:32,813
That body builder hit me at least
400 to 500 punches like Jackie Chan.

1457
01:23:33,017 --> 01:23:34,211
And for that only 500?

1458
01:23:34,418 --> 01:23:37,046
Even if a cycle guy hits you,
one gets more than 500.

1459
01:23:38,522 --> 01:23:40,387
So how much do you want
to get from here?

1460
01:23:43,294 --> 01:23:45,592
13,90,000. - That's all!

1461
01:23:46,063 --> 01:23:48,623
Just so little? This is very little.

1462
01:23:48,833 --> 01:23:50,824
Oh! Is it like that?

1463
01:23:51,035 --> 01:23:55,062
Lf... I give you 15 lakhs then? - What!

1464
01:23:55,873 --> 01:23:57,306
Then the deal is final.
Absolutely final.

1465
01:23:57,508 --> 01:24:00,602
Hey! Don't try to act too smart!

1466
01:24:00,878 --> 01:24:03,142
If brother comes to know that
you can speak then he...

1467
01:24:03,347 --> 01:24:06,077
...will beat you up not like Jackie Chan
but like Mike Tyson.

1468
01:24:06,384 --> 01:24:07,942
That's why I am telling you to
disappear from here.

1469
01:24:08,152 --> 01:24:08,914
Understood?

1470
01:24:09,220 --> 01:24:11,245
Tomorrow morning
I should not see you here!

1471
01:24:12,723 --> 01:24:14,247
Hey smarty! Wait!

1472
01:24:20,264 --> 01:24:21,697
What do you think of yourself?

1473
01:24:22,199 --> 01:24:23,359
You are threatening me?

1474
01:24:24,235 --> 01:24:27,432
That letter which you have written is
still in that body builder's hand.

1475
01:24:27,738 --> 01:24:29,899
And here everyone knows that I have
just come a few days back.

1476
01:24:30,107 --> 01:24:31,631
I don't know Gujarati.

1477
01:24:31,876 --> 01:24:34,470
And why will I be interested in
breaking her marriage?

1478
01:24:34,678 --> 01:24:36,737
Am I her lover? - Hey! - Hey, you!

1479
01:24:36,947 --> 01:24:38,107
Don't show your temper!

1480
01:24:38,783 --> 01:24:42,719
To prove that the handwriting in the
letter is yours I just have...

1481
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:45,115
...to tell them to match your handwriting
with the letter.

1482
01:24:45,356 --> 01:24:46,482
After that you only answer them.

1483
01:24:46,690 --> 01:24:50,057
If I get angry I will also tell them
that you were jealous since...

1484
01:24:50,261 --> 01:24:52,229
...they were thinking only of her marriage
and not of yours.

1485
01:24:52,430 --> 01:24:53,522
And then they will even start
doubting that it was...

1486
01:24:53,731 --> 01:24:56,325
...because of you that the
earlier marriage had broken.

1487
01:24:56,534 --> 01:24:59,833
And by mistake if I open my mouth
then you will be doomed!

1488
01:25:05,609 --> 01:25:06,735
Good night!

1489
01:25:13,017 --> 01:25:15,485
Gundya-bhau, stop! - Why should I stop?

1490
01:25:15,686 --> 01:25:17,176
I have come here to battle it out.

1491
01:25:17,388 --> 01:25:20,619
Battle? - That scoundrel, hits my nephew?
That fool!

1492
01:25:20,825 --> 01:25:21,849
Gundya, don't be a goon.

1493
01:25:22,059 --> 01:25:23,424
If they come to know that I have told...

1494
01:25:23,627 --> 01:25:24,821
...you then I will have to
lose out on my job.

1495
01:25:25,029 --> 01:25:26,997
Just let go of this job of his!

1496
01:25:27,198 --> 01:25:28,290
I will give you a job.

1497
01:25:28,499 --> 01:25:29,488
Come to my boat from tomorrow.

1498
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:31,361
What work will I do on the boat?

1499
01:25:31,569 --> 01:25:33,696
I will transform you into a scary person
and insert an iron...

1500
01:25:33,904 --> 01:25:37,340
...rod into you then even the crows
won't trouble the fishes.

1501
01:25:37,541 --> 01:25:39,975
You all have hit my nephew, right?

1502
01:25:40,177 --> 01:25:41,610
Till the time this matter doesn't get...

1503
01:25:41,812 --> 01:25:42,779
...solved I am not going to go from here.

1504
01:25:42,980 --> 01:25:43,605
No, no. Go!

1505
01:25:43,814 --> 01:25:46,977
Come out! - He has come. - You Gujarati!

1506
01:25:47,751 --> 01:25:49,116
You Gujarati!

1507
01:25:50,454 --> 01:25:54,720
See, Gundya brother,
we committed a mistake.

1508
01:25:54,925 --> 01:25:55,789
You committed a mistake?

1509
01:25:55,993 --> 01:25:57,221
Is this an answer?

1510
01:25:57,428 --> 01:25:58,292
You hit a dumb and deaf person so...

1511
01:25:58,496 --> 01:26:00,828
...ruthlessly and you say that
it was just a mistake.

1512
01:26:01,031 --> 01:26:02,396
Calm down! - Remove your hand!

1513
01:26:06,837 --> 01:26:08,862
See, you do one thing.

1514
01:26:09,340 --> 01:26:12,366
Take your nephew with you.
Give me the money later.

1515
01:26:12,576 --> 01:26:13,304
No!

1516
01:26:13,544 --> 01:26:15,011
You had given your word.
Now stick by it!

1517
01:26:15,212 --> 01:26:16,509
Now don't change colours
like a chameleon.

1518
01:26:16,714 --> 01:26:17,908
What did you say?

1519
01:26:18,115 --> 01:26:19,742
That till the time I don't return your...

1520
01:26:19,950 --> 01:26:21,542
...money you are not going to leave them.

1521
01:26:21,752 --> 01:26:22,514
Did you say that or not?

1522
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:24,551
So then till the time I don't give you...

1523
01:26:24,755 --> 01:26:26,518
...the money, don't leave him
and I don't even want him.

1524
01:26:26,724 --> 01:26:29,488
Listen to me... - Hey! Don't come
in between our discussion.

1525
01:26:29,693 --> 01:26:32,821
Yes! My money matter is different.
Understood?

1526
01:26:33,030 --> 01:26:36,966
But this... that you hit him so badly.
Settle those scores!

1527
01:26:38,068 --> 01:26:40,059
Softly, softly.

1528
01:26:40,371 --> 01:26:43,169
Mangal is inside. - I am not afraid of any
Mangal (Mars) and Shani (Saturn)!

1529
01:26:43,374 --> 01:26:45,137
And I am also the son of Kharwar!

1530
01:26:45,342 --> 01:26:46,832
When any fisherman's son cries then...

1531
01:26:47,044 --> 01:26:48,102
...do you know what the mother says to him?

1532
01:26:48,312 --> 01:26:50,507
Go to sleep, go to sleep.
Or else Gundya will come.

1533
01:26:50,714 --> 01:26:51,612
Go to sleep!

1534
01:26:51,815 --> 01:26:53,214
I have heard this a lot of times!

1535
01:26:53,417 --> 01:26:54,884
Saw even he has heard about it.

1536
01:26:55,085 --> 01:26:56,916
Call your Mangal or whoever it is!

1537
01:26:57,121 --> 01:26:59,589
I won't even spare him! Call him!

1538
01:26:59,790 --> 01:27:02,315
Scoundrel! Hey, I told you not to touch me.
Didn't I tell you!

1539
01:27:03,994 --> 01:27:06,428
Whatever happened, it happened unknowingly.
- I understood, sir.

1540
01:27:06,664 --> 01:27:08,359
Whatever I did was a mistake.

1541
01:27:08,966 --> 01:27:10,695
I have already atoned for it.

1542
01:27:11,969 --> 01:27:13,766
Call him! - Kanhaiya!

1543
01:27:15,706 --> 01:27:17,298
I have put him on a job.

1544
01:27:19,577 --> 01:27:21,772
20,000 salary. Is that fine?

1545
01:27:23,247 --> 01:27:24,714
If you open your mouth the
next time then...

1546
01:27:40,531 --> 01:27:42,055
20,000.

1547
01:27:44,535 --> 01:27:45,263
Take care of it.

1548
01:27:45,469 --> 01:27:47,596
Don't let it go anywhere. Okay?

1549
01:27:48,906 --> 01:27:55,675
I... will come on the 1st and
will take this and go. Okay?

1550
01:27:55,913 --> 01:27:57,244
Yes. Okay!

1551
01:28:02,586 --> 01:28:03,553
Thief!

1552
01:28:05,756 --> 01:28:07,280
You want to steal the iron?

1553
01:28:08,959 --> 01:28:09,425
No, no.

1554
01:28:09,627 --> 01:28:12,460
If they catch me with this then they will
make me a Jabba like you.

1555
01:28:17,768 --> 01:28:19,258
Iron will disappear!

1556
01:28:25,476 --> 01:28:28,104
I have lost 18 crores
in the soap business.

1557
01:28:28,512 --> 01:28:31,276
See, no one should come to know
about this. - Okay.

1558
01:28:44,528 --> 01:28:46,962
Did you get the money?
- No, I didn't get it.

1559
01:28:47,164 --> 01:28:49,928
Then for what have you come here
with a sad face?

1560
01:28:50,134 --> 01:28:51,601
You are useless of the first order!

1561
01:28:52,369 --> 01:28:53,927
Can't you get the money back?

1562
01:28:54,972 --> 01:28:55,529
When I had given him the responsibility...

1563
01:28:55,739 --> 01:28:57,798
...to get the money back from the people
of this village then only...

1564
01:28:58,008 --> 01:29:00,340
...I had understood that this company
would get doomed.

1565
01:29:02,179 --> 01:29:06,639
By hiding it from Mangal, very sneakily
I give you so much money.

1566
01:29:06,850 --> 01:29:07,817
And you are ruining me only.

1567
01:29:08,018 --> 01:29:09,178
What should I tell you, Seth-ji?

1568
01:29:09,386 --> 01:29:12,082
That boy named Jeetu was so cunning that
everyone fell into his trap.

1569
01:29:12,289 --> 01:29:12,755
And even I fell into it.

1570
01:29:12,956 --> 01:29:14,548
But money has gone, right!

1571
01:29:14,825 --> 01:29:16,588
You were saying that he died by drowning...

1572
01:29:16,794 --> 01:29:18,386
...in the water and you will get the
money from insurance.

1573
01:29:18,595 --> 01:29:19,653
What happened of that?

1574
01:29:20,030 --> 01:29:21,793
His father is saying that his body
hasn't been found yet.

1575
01:29:21,999 --> 01:29:23,523
So that's why the insurance people are
not giving the money yet.

1576
01:29:23,734 --> 01:29:25,395
Lie! His father is talking nonsense!

1577
01:29:25,602 --> 01:29:27,069
His father must have
taken away all the money!

1578
01:29:27,271 --> 01:29:28,932
Go and catch his father's throat and...

1579
01:29:29,139 --> 01:29:30,868
...after that we will get
our money back quickly.

1580
01:29:31,075 --> 01:29:32,508
It is not a big deal to catch his throat.

1581
01:29:32,710 --> 01:29:34,701
The people have made his
condition worse than this.

1582
01:29:34,912 --> 01:29:36,675
They removed his loincloth
in the middle of the market.

1583
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:37,869
They have thrown stones at the house.

1584
01:29:38,082 --> 01:29:40,414
Now the people are saying that
now if he doesn't...

1585
01:29:40,617 --> 01:29:41,549
...return the money then they
will burn his house.

1586
01:29:41,752 --> 01:29:42,582
This is the right thing!

1587
01:29:42,786 --> 01:29:44,344
This is how you get your money back!

1588
01:29:44,588 --> 01:29:45,612
This is how a person
gets his money back!

1589
01:29:45,823 --> 01:29:47,688
This is a true Indian.

1590
01:29:47,891 --> 01:29:50,257
Have you got the accounts? - Yes, here are
the accounts. Here it is.

1591
01:29:54,498 --> 01:29:55,260
One minute.

1592
01:29:57,401 --> 01:29:58,459
This Jeet guy has really made
my life miserable to live.

1593
01:29:58,669 --> 01:30:01,263
Sir! You, the person who is
wearing a loincloth!

1594
01:30:01,739 --> 01:30:04,708
Listen! I am Prabhat Singh Chauhan's
daughter. Meenakshi.

1595
01:30:05,409 --> 01:30:07,070
Do you know any guy called Jeet?

1596
01:30:07,277 --> 01:30:09,507
Yes, what happened?
- Do you know him well?

1597
01:30:09,713 --> 01:30:11,044
I know him very well.

1598
01:30:11,248 --> 01:30:13,045
He was a fraud of the first order!

1599
01:30:13,250 --> 01:30:15,241
He used to take the money and disappear.

1600
01:30:15,452 --> 01:30:17,943
Now since he is dead.
Even his body is deceiving us.

1601
01:30:18,155 --> 01:30:18,644
Even that has disappeared.

1602
01:30:18,856 --> 01:30:21,984
Till we don't find his dead body
I can't even sleep peacefully.

1603
01:30:22,192 --> 01:30:24,057
Do you have any photograph of his?

1604
01:30:24,461 --> 01:30:25,758
Wherever we might find his dead body...

1605
01:30:25,963 --> 01:30:29,729
...to recognize it as a proof
I always keep his photo with me.

1606
01:30:29,933 --> 01:30:30,865
Look at this.

1607
01:30:34,705 --> 01:30:36,297
He has betrayed the entire village.

1608
01:30:36,507 --> 01:30:37,906
He is not worthy of any trust.

1609
01:30:38,108 --> 01:30:39,234
He is just telling lies
one after the other.

1610
01:30:39,443 --> 01:30:41,468
And he is not related to Gundya- bhau.

1611
01:30:41,678 --> 01:30:43,543
His father is the head master of a school.

1612
01:30:43,747 --> 01:30:44,907
And he hasn't even spared him!

1613
01:30:45,115 --> 01:30:48,084
Because of him it has become difficult
for their entire family to live.

1614
01:30:52,456 --> 01:30:54,014
'What are you doing? '

1615
01:30:54,224 --> 01:30:56,089
'Lf you don't pay the money on time
then this only will happen! '

1616
01:30:56,293 --> 01:30:57,920
'Leave me! '

1617
01:31:02,366 --> 01:31:03,993
Whenever there is an urgent work office...

1618
01:31:04,201 --> 01:31:06,431
...people take an off on that day itself!

1619
01:31:06,970 --> 01:31:08,835
If this money doesn't reach Mehta sir...

1620
01:31:09,039 --> 01:31:11,667
...till 5 o'clock in the evening
then it will be horrendous.

1621
01:31:11,875 --> 01:31:14,002
Look this money.

1622
01:31:15,245 --> 01:31:20,740
5 o'clock. 5 o'clock. Mehta sir...
Mehta. Cap.

1623
01:31:21,118 --> 01:31:22,608
It should reach him.

1624
01:31:22,886 --> 01:31:25,650
Or else everything will go wrong.
Understood?

1625
01:31:28,292 --> 01:31:29,759
Hey! I learnt it.

1626
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:31,218
It is very easy.

1627
01:31:32,162 --> 01:31:35,723
Take this. Count it quickly. Check whether
it is right. And come.

1628
01:31:54,284 --> 01:31:55,876
Brother, father hasn't come till now.

1629
01:32:00,924 --> 01:32:02,653
We will find him.
You all don't worry.

1630
01:32:02,926 --> 01:32:04,223
Uncle will come.

1631
01:32:04,528 --> 01:32:05,961
They have taken a lot of money and gone.

1632
01:32:06,163 --> 01:32:07,255
And along with them that
boy is also there.

1633
01:32:07,464 --> 01:32:10,228
That Gundya-bhau's nephew,
if he does something then... - No.

1634
01:32:10,434 --> 01:32:11,992
That boy can't do anything of that sort.

1635
01:32:12,202 --> 01:32:14,136
I know he is a fraud of the first order.

1636
01:32:14,338 --> 01:32:15,396
He will definitely betray us.

1637
01:32:15,606 --> 01:32:19,007
And he can do anything for
money, brother. Anything.

1638
01:32:19,243 --> 01:32:21,905
I know that's why I am telling you.
Do something quick. Please!

1639
01:32:22,546 --> 01:32:25,481
Tell us! Since when he is here?

1640
01:32:26,650 --> 01:32:27,344
What?

1641
01:32:28,485 --> 01:32:31,079
After he has gone from here has
someone called here? - No.

1642
01:32:31,288 --> 01:32:32,312
We have looked for them
at a lot of places.

1643
01:32:32,523 --> 01:32:34,491
But till now we have no news of them.

1644
01:32:35,492 --> 01:32:36,618
There is a message from the station, sir.

1645
01:32:38,195 --> 01:32:40,925
Sir, we have arrested him.
But he is not saying anything.

1646
01:32:41,965 --> 01:32:43,159
We have found that person.

1647
01:32:43,367 --> 01:32:44,834
But he is not saying anything
when he is being asked.

1648
01:32:45,035 --> 01:32:48,198
When I go and slap him only
then will he start speaking.

1649
01:32:48,405 --> 01:32:49,201
Come on!

1650
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:10,419
Father... father... what happened to you?
- What happened?

1651
01:33:10,627 --> 01:33:12,390
Uncle. - How did this happen?

1652
01:33:12,596 --> 01:33:15,030
Nothing. Nothing. Don't worry.

1653
01:33:15,232 --> 01:33:17,462
Are you okay? - Don't worry.
I am fine.

1654
01:33:18,502 --> 01:33:19,833
We had met with a small accident.

1655
01:33:20,037 --> 01:33:23,234
Good that Kanhaiya was with me.

1656
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:24,372
He saved me.

1657
01:33:24,575 --> 01:33:26,236
He took me to the hospital.

1658
01:33:26,443 --> 01:33:28,468
Then whom we had to give the money...

1659
01:33:28,679 --> 01:33:30,544
...to he gave the money and came too.

1660
01:33:32,115 --> 01:33:33,742
And after that he went to take medicines.

1661
01:33:34,585 --> 01:33:36,018
But he didn't come back after that.

1662
01:33:37,154 --> 01:33:38,212
Did he come here?

1663
01:34:39,583 --> 01:34:42,882
When you didn't come back then
I thought that...

1664
01:34:45,288 --> 01:34:47,984
That I really ran away with the money.

1665
01:34:49,926 --> 01:34:52,520
TeacherJaidev Prasad's son
has learnt everything.

1666
01:34:53,530 --> 01:34:55,088
But he didn't learn to rob.

1667
01:34:57,868 --> 01:34:59,699
And nor do I know to betray anyone.

1668
01:35:01,538 --> 01:35:03,631
If I knew then I wouldn't be
in this state today.

1669
01:35:07,811 --> 01:35:11,679
Before people burn my house down...
I will have to go there.

1670
01:35:11,882 --> 01:35:14,749
Because they will get the
insurance money only...

1671
01:35:14,951 --> 01:35:16,612
...when my dead body will reach there.

1672
01:35:20,691 --> 01:35:22,750
But I can't even walk and go there myself.

1673
01:35:24,995 --> 01:35:28,556
Someone will have to lift me...
I mean my dead body.

1674
01:35:33,770 --> 01:35:39,436
This was my second birth.
Without saying or hearing anything.

1675
01:35:39,843 --> 01:35:41,071
I was just going on living.

1676
01:35:47,050 --> 01:35:51,248
But now the time has come to end
even this birth.

1677
01:36:00,931 --> 01:36:02,125
Burn them.

1678
01:36:03,667 --> 01:36:06,101
And this... what is this account?

1679
01:36:06,303 --> 01:36:09,295
This account... is the account of
fishing finance company.

1680
01:36:09,506 --> 01:36:13,909
35 lakhs is our investment then how...

1681
01:36:14,111 --> 01:36:15,976
...have we suffered losses of 36 lakhs?

1682
01:36:16,179 --> 01:36:19,444
See we gave 35 lakhs to people on loan.

1683
01:36:19,649 --> 01:36:23,585
And to get the money back
we had to spend 1 lakh.

1684
01:36:24,955 --> 01:36:27,423
Actually the thing is that
in order to get...

1685
01:36:27,624 --> 01:36:30,149
...the money back I had go to the
hospital many times.

1686
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:32,089
And I am counting all that
and telling you.

1687
01:36:33,697 --> 01:36:34,459
Oh no!

1688
01:36:34,664 --> 01:36:36,825
I feel before Mangal gets to know about...

1689
01:36:37,033 --> 01:36:39,627
...this I will have shut
all the businesses.

1690
01:36:40,537 --> 01:36:43,438
No problem. We will inform
Mangal brother.

1691
01:36:43,640 --> 01:36:45,107
And not only about these losses.

1692
01:36:45,308 --> 01:36:48,038
But we will also tell him about
all the losses of this year.

1693
01:36:48,245 --> 01:36:48,939
What!

1694
01:36:52,783 --> 01:36:56,275
Yes. And how much do you have
to take from Sharma-ji?

1695
01:36:58,355 --> 01:36:59,219
Sharma!

1696
01:37:00,056 --> 01:37:02,718
Who is Sharma? What is Sharma?
Where is Sharma from?

1697
01:37:02,926 --> 01:37:04,450
Tell me, do you know any Sharma?

1698
01:37:04,661 --> 01:37:05,127
Yes... yes.

1699
01:37:05,328 --> 01:37:07,455
No, no. Which Sharma?

1700
01:37:07,664 --> 01:37:08,631
See, he himself doesn't know Sharma.

1701
01:37:08,832 --> 01:37:10,891
I don't know Sharma.

1702
01:37:11,101 --> 01:37:13,467
So then... then how do you all know Sharma?
What are you all talking?

1703
01:37:13,670 --> 01:37:14,364
Is it?

1704
01:37:14,571 --> 01:37:16,471
Then ask all that from Mangal brother.

1705
01:37:16,673 --> 01:37:17,605
Girls! Girls!

1706
01:37:17,808 --> 01:37:20,470
Listen to me. See, dear.

1707
01:37:20,677 --> 01:37:23,373
Don't tell anything to Mangal brother.

1708
01:37:24,014 --> 01:37:26,847
That... whatever you will tell me
I will give you that.

1709
01:37:30,253 --> 01:37:31,185
I don't want anything.

1710
01:37:31,388 --> 01:37:34,880
First stop all these futile businesses.
And think something big.

1711
01:37:35,091 --> 01:37:36,023
I will.

1712
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:40,896
Do you know why does Mangal brother's
every business run so well?

1713
01:37:41,531 --> 01:37:44,762
Because he starts every business of his
from Shruti's hands.

1714
01:37:44,968 --> 01:37:46,492
That's why listen to me, father.

1715
01:37:46,703 --> 01:37:50,901
And get your new finance company
inaugurated by Shruti's hands.

1716
01:37:51,274 --> 01:37:52,400
But... how is that?

1717
01:37:52,609 --> 01:37:54,236
Listen to me carefully.

1718
01:37:54,444 --> 01:37:57,174
Right now you give Shruti 13,90,000.

1719
01:37:57,380 --> 01:38:03,478
And next year she will return you
all that money with interest.

1720
01:38:07,290 --> 01:38:09,690
Give it. Give it. Give the money.

1721
01:38:09,893 --> 01:38:13,090
As it is we give the money to outsiders
and run into losses, right?

1722
01:38:13,296 --> 01:38:14,558
This time we will give her the chance.

1723
01:38:14,764 --> 01:38:17,358
And if there will be a loss,
then it will be at home only.

1724
01:38:29,579 --> 01:38:32,878
Hey Bandya! - I didn't know that
I look so handsome.

1725
01:38:33,083 --> 01:38:34,414
What do you have to say? - Shut up!

1726
01:38:34,618 --> 01:38:37,178
We haven't called you here to see
how handsome you are. Come here.

1727
01:38:38,088 --> 01:38:39,248
And keep the bag down.

1728
01:38:39,723 --> 01:38:41,350
And whatever we said you understood, right? - Yes.

1729
01:38:41,558 --> 01:38:43,116
What did you understand?
- To keep the bag down.

1730
01:38:43,326 --> 01:38:44,020
I will give you one!

1731
01:38:44,227 --> 01:38:46,218
This is not a joke! This is a
job of great responsibility.

1732
01:38:46,429 --> 01:38:47,919
Of what? To keep the bag down?

1733
01:38:58,408 --> 01:39:00,035
Now tell me. What is the first thing
that you will do?

1734
01:39:00,243 --> 01:39:01,904
First I will board the village's bus.

1735
01:39:02,112 --> 01:39:03,602
Then I will give the conductor 100 rupees.

1736
01:39:03,813 --> 01:39:05,110
I will buy a ticket worth 92 rupees.

1737
01:39:05,315 --> 01:39:07,146
Then? - Then I will take the
remaining change back.

1738
01:39:07,350 --> 01:39:09,477
Oh! Then? - Then I will get down
at the bus stop.

1739
01:39:09,686 --> 01:39:11,745
And after getting down I will ask
for the house of Javed Prasad.

1740
01:39:11,955 --> 01:39:13,980
Not Javed Prasad. It's Jaidev Prasad.

1741
01:39:14,190 --> 01:39:17,489
Yes, that's fine. The remaining work
I will get done with it quickly.

1742
01:39:17,694 --> 01:39:18,388
How is that?

1743
01:39:18,595 --> 01:39:21,962
I have written down everything in a paper
and kept it in my pocket.

1744
01:39:25,502 --> 01:39:26,992
Yes, what is the name of the
teacher's son?

1745
01:39:27,203 --> 01:39:27,828
The dead Jeetu.

1746
01:39:28,038 --> 01:39:29,562
You don't need to say that he is dead.

1747
01:39:29,773 --> 01:39:31,832
Just say Jeetu. That is enough.
- If it is enough then it is fine.

1748
01:39:32,042 --> 01:39:34,840
Who are you? - Bandya.
- How are you related to Jeetu!

1749
01:39:35,045 --> 01:39:37,946
I am dead Jeetu's very close friend.

1750
01:39:38,148 --> 01:39:41,379
Tell me one thing. How does this
dead Jeetu look like? - Why?

1751
01:39:41,584 --> 01:39:42,107
What do you have to do?

1752
01:39:42,319 --> 01:39:44,844
No, if I meet him on the way then
I will give him the bag.

1753
01:39:45,055 --> 01:39:46,454
What is the need to go so far?

1754
01:39:46,656 --> 01:39:48,556
Now are you going or not?
- Fine. I will go.

1755
01:39:48,758 --> 01:39:50,623
Hey! Take the bag and go at least.

1756
01:39:50,827 --> 01:39:52,522
Oh! This bag is very forgetful.

1757
01:39:52,729 --> 01:39:53,855
Wherever I keep it, it stays there only.

1758
01:39:54,064 --> 01:39:55,031
Come on straight!

1759
01:39:55,632 --> 01:39:56,360
And listen! - Yes.

1760
01:39:56,566 --> 01:39:59,034
Don't come back after you give the bag
like a tamed dog.

1761
01:39:59,235 --> 01:40:00,725
How much ever information you can...

1762
01:40:00,937 --> 01:40:02,234
...gather about Jeetu get that and come.

1763
01:40:06,643 --> 01:40:07,974
Come out!

1764
01:40:08,178 --> 01:40:10,237
Hey, come out!

1765
01:40:11,314 --> 01:40:12,747
Give my money!

1766
01:40:12,949 --> 01:40:14,712
Move aside! Move aside!

1767
01:40:14,918 --> 01:40:15,748
Don't spare him!

1768
01:40:19,189 --> 01:40:20,417
Shut up!

1769
01:40:20,623 --> 01:40:21,954
What is this? Give money! Give money!

1770
01:40:22,792 --> 01:40:24,191
Is this the house of Jeet who is dead?

1771
01:40:24,394 --> 01:40:25,918
Yes, it is. What is the matter?

1772
01:40:26,896 --> 01:40:29,262
Amongst all of you who is the
father of Jeet who is dead?

1773
01:40:30,567 --> 01:40:32,432
Why? What is the matter?

1774
01:40:34,704 --> 01:40:36,797
So you are Jaidev Prasad? - Yes.

1775
01:40:37,007 --> 01:40:37,769
What do you want?

1776
01:40:37,974 --> 01:40:40,272
The boss of All and Soul company has sent me.

1777
01:40:40,477 --> 01:40:42,775
That means the partner of
Jeet who is dead.

1778
01:40:42,979 --> 01:40:45,743
It is the matter of money, is it?
- Yes, yes. How do you know?

1779
01:40:45,949 --> 01:40:47,416
Then you also go and stand in the crowd.

1780
01:40:47,617 --> 01:40:50,017
They all have gathered
to burn this house. - What!

1781
01:40:50,220 --> 01:40:52,780
To burn the house? - Yes, go and
stand with all of them.

1782
01:40:52,989 --> 01:40:55,184
And after that all of you
together burn us.

1783
01:40:55,392 --> 01:40:58,122
If that repays all of your loans
then it is fine.

1784
01:40:58,395 --> 01:41:02,855
But the truth is that I don't have
even a single penny to give you all.

1785
01:41:03,433 --> 01:41:05,594
And I don't even have the courage
to commit suicide.

1786
01:41:06,102 --> 01:41:08,468
You all may do you as wish. Go!

1787
01:41:10,807 --> 01:41:12,570
You get down! Get down!

1788
01:41:12,909 --> 01:41:14,774
Early in the morning you have come
with a bag to ask for money.

1789
01:41:14,978 --> 01:41:16,070
And why have you got such a small bag.

1790
01:41:16,279 --> 01:41:16,973
Why haven't you got a big truck?

1791
01:41:17,180 --> 01:41:18,772
Hey you! Go now! Like you even
we have come to take our money.

1792
01:41:18,982 --> 01:41:19,710
We are no fools!

1793
01:41:19,916 --> 01:41:23,716
I have not come to take money
but to give it. It is in this bag.

1794
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:27,583
What! - He says that there is
money in the bag.

1795
01:41:27,791 --> 01:41:30,658
What did you say? - That I have come
to give the money.

1796
01:41:33,797 --> 01:41:35,287
To whom? - To you.

1797
01:41:35,498 --> 01:41:38,729
You mean to say that you have
come to give him money.

1798
01:41:38,935 --> 01:41:40,300
Was I speaking in Chinese till now?

1799
01:41:40,503 --> 01:41:41,231
No, I heard something else.

1800
01:41:41,438 --> 01:41:44,703
Actually Master-ji,
the company ran into losses.

1801
01:41:44,908 --> 01:41:46,102
Still it is making profit.

1802
01:41:46,309 --> 01:41:49,904
So the share of profit that belongs to
Jeet who is dead that is in this bag.

1803
01:41:50,113 --> 01:41:50,943
How much is it?

1804
01:41:51,414 --> 01:41:54,349
I don't know how much is it? I was asked
to deliver the bag here.

1805
01:41:54,551 --> 01:41:55,711
So then open it, you fool!
Why are you standing?

1806
01:41:55,919 --> 01:41:58,251
Open it! Let's see.

1807
01:42:09,199 --> 01:42:10,996
What was the need for you to do all this?

1808
01:42:14,304 --> 01:42:16,738
She said to send it. So I sent it.

1809
01:42:18,508 --> 01:42:22,842
Whenever I was in trouble,
I used to remember God.

1810
01:42:24,314 --> 01:42:29,183
I used to wish for a lot of things.
But he never listened to me.

1811
01:42:30,887 --> 01:42:32,684
Then I started feeling that
he doesn't exist.

1812
01:42:34,557 --> 01:42:35,956
But today I saw him.

1813
01:42:39,262 --> 01:42:42,789
Just give me your consent to thank you.

1814
01:42:55,478 --> 01:42:56,376
Greetings.

1815
01:42:56,579 --> 01:42:59,377
Mohan... this is Mohan Rao-ji's house, right?

1816
01:42:59,816 --> 01:43:00,646
Yes. Why?

1817
01:43:02,552 --> 01:43:05,316
I was thinking of seeing him
once and going away.

1818
01:43:06,222 --> 01:43:07,246
I am Mohan Rao.

1819
01:43:07,457 --> 01:43:10,722
You have seen me. Now go away.
- Okay. Thank you.

1820
01:43:18,635 --> 01:43:19,465
What is it?

1821
01:43:20,203 --> 01:43:23,172
Jeetu who is dead, I am his
very close friend. - What?

1822
01:43:23,373 --> 01:43:26,809
I mean that I am a close friend
to dead Jeetu. - What?

1823
01:43:27,043 --> 01:43:27,839
I mean I was.

1824
01:43:28,278 --> 01:43:32,942
I mean... I am... I am.

1825
01:43:33,283 --> 01:43:36,514
What are you talking? You fool,
have you gone mad?

1826
01:43:36,719 --> 01:43:37,651
What work do you have?

1827
01:43:37,854 --> 01:43:39,947
People say that this is the house
of that girl Pooja whose...

1828
01:43:40,156 --> 01:43:41,350
...marriage was to take place with
the Jeetu who is now dead.

1829
01:43:41,558 --> 01:43:42,286
Shut up!

1830
01:43:42,625 --> 01:43:44,684
I warn you from taking his
name in the house!

1831
01:43:45,228 --> 01:43:47,423
Okay. Fine. I will not take his name.

1832
01:43:48,364 --> 01:43:51,128
Can I meet her?
- She doesn't stay here!

1833
01:43:51,467 --> 01:43:53,435
If you want to meet her then
go to her husband's house.

1834
01:43:54,737 --> 01:43:56,602
Husband's house? - Yes, husband!

1835
01:43:57,006 --> 01:44:00,032
Husband! Husband! What nonsense!

1836
01:44:01,211 --> 01:44:02,269
And anything else?

1837
01:44:03,379 --> 01:44:06,678
Now if you ask even anything else
about him then...

1838
01:44:06,883 --> 01:44:08,111
Go from here!

1839
01:44:09,252 --> 01:44:11,880
Oh God!

1840
01:44:15,592 --> 01:44:18,288
Hey! This is him!

1841
01:44:21,130 --> 01:44:22,119
Who is he?

1842
01:44:26,703 --> 01:44:28,068
What did you ask?

1843
01:44:28,271 --> 01:44:29,397
Who is he?

1844
01:44:31,708 --> 01:44:33,676
How are you related to Jeetu?

1845
01:44:38,681 --> 01:44:40,672
So you don't know who he is?

1846
01:44:43,686 --> 01:44:45,415
I will explain you now itself!

1847
01:44:48,224 --> 01:44:50,920
You scoundrel! You demon!

1848
01:44:54,330 --> 01:44:55,490
The bone of a fish!

1849
01:44:55,698 --> 01:44:59,794
You betrayer! You have maintained
your friendship very well!

1850
01:45:00,003 --> 01:45:01,937
You deceived me so much!

1851
01:45:02,272 --> 01:45:05,969
Jerk, I saved your life then you could
have at least told me something.

1852
01:45:06,175 --> 01:45:08,370
Tell me one thing.
I want to hear you speak.

1853
01:45:08,578 --> 01:45:09,374
And remember one thing.

1854
01:45:09,579 --> 01:45:13,015
If I can save your life then
I can even make you speak.

1855
01:45:13,216 --> 01:45:15,684
Speak up, you jerk! Speak up!

1856
01:45:15,885 --> 01:45:17,443
Please forgive me, buddy.

1857
01:45:25,161 --> 01:45:26,822
Okay, now listen. Now listen. One second.
- This is not fair.

1858
01:45:27,030 --> 01:45:27,792
Just understand my problem.

1859
01:45:27,997 --> 01:45:29,225
What is all this happening?

1860
01:45:30,266 --> 01:45:32,029
I have found out everything.

1861
01:45:32,235 --> 01:45:34,362
I have used my brains and
found out everything.

1862
01:45:34,570 --> 01:45:38,301
He can speak. - Fine. Leave all this.
- I have left it.

1863
01:45:38,508 --> 01:45:41,238
Do you want to use my brain and
find out about anything? - Yes.

1864
01:45:41,444 --> 01:45:43,309
Along with your brains use
a little of soap too.

1865
01:45:43,513 --> 01:45:45,538
The clothes are kept outside,
go and wash them and come.

1866
01:45:49,018 --> 01:45:51,384
Then what? Husband!
What kind of husband!

1867
01:45:51,954 --> 01:45:53,182
He said that and spat.

1868
01:45:55,124 --> 01:45:56,216
One thing is clear that the
relations between...

1869
01:45:56,426 --> 01:45:58,394
...the father-in-law and the
son-in-law aren't pleasant.

1870
01:45:59,629 --> 01:46:01,256
Uncle is very hot-tempered.

1871
01:46:01,931 --> 01:46:04,832
Okay, this is good that
Pooja has got married.

1872
01:46:06,636 --> 01:46:08,501
Even I used to pray
for the same thing.

1873
01:46:09,005 --> 01:46:10,768
That wherever she is
she must be happy.

1874
01:46:10,973 --> 01:46:12,440
That is enough for me.

1875
01:46:13,609 --> 01:46:16,077
Have you seen her husband's photograph?

1876
01:46:16,713 --> 01:46:17,645
Photograph?

1877
01:46:18,881 --> 01:46:21,714
The pain of seeing one photograph
hasn't gone yet.

1878
01:46:21,918 --> 01:46:22,885
You keep quiet, you dumb guy!

1879
01:46:23,086 --> 01:46:25,111
I am finding your friendship
very difficult to handle.

1880
01:46:25,321 --> 01:46:26,413
Hello!

1881
01:46:27,724 --> 01:46:30,454
She is asking that now all your
difficulties have been solved.

1882
01:46:30,793 --> 01:46:33,523
Then why don't you go to your village
and meet everyone and come?

1883
01:46:35,064 --> 01:46:35,689
No.

1884
01:46:37,233 --> 01:46:40,794
Pooja has always waited
for me to marry her.

1885
01:46:41,571 --> 01:46:43,266
I have done a lot of injustice to her.

1886
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:45,171
Now I don't want to do
any more injustice.

1887
01:46:46,409 --> 01:46:48,639
She is married today because
she thought that I was dead.

1888
01:46:49,645 --> 01:46:51,977
If I go back and she sees that I am...

1889
01:46:52,181 --> 01:46:55,810
...alive then she won't be
able to tolerate it.

1890
01:46:56,919 --> 01:46:58,944
Her settled life will get ruined.

1891
01:47:00,523 --> 01:47:05,119
That's why I have decided that
I will never go back to the village.

1892
01:47:05,928 --> 01:47:06,758
Never.

1893
01:47:16,706 --> 01:47:18,606
So have you decided to stay here only?

1894
01:47:19,075 --> 01:47:21,339
Yes. I am thinking that I will learn a...

1895
01:47:21,544 --> 01:47:24,138
...little bit of Gujarati and
stay here only with you all.

1896
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:28,416
Is it? So do you have so much guts?
- Yes.

1897
01:47:28,618 --> 01:47:31,086
So should I get her married to you?
- Yes.

1898
01:47:34,791 --> 01:47:37,021
I am telling the truth.
She really likes you a lot.

1899
01:47:37,226 --> 01:47:38,454
Do you like her or not?

1900
01:47:40,029 --> 01:47:41,053
No, no.

1901
01:47:41,564 --> 01:47:42,428
No, no.

1902
01:47:42,632 --> 01:47:46,159
Tell me whether you like her?
- No, no.

1903
01:47:48,104 --> 01:47:49,401
That means you don't like her?

1904
01:47:50,206 --> 01:47:53,539
No, it is not that I don't like her.

1905
01:47:54,177 --> 01:47:58,739
I like her. - Okay.
So this is Romeo's inner feelings!

1906
01:48:00,783 --> 01:48:01,681
That smart Charlie!

1907
01:48:01,884 --> 01:48:03,283
No, not like that.

1908
01:48:03,486 --> 01:48:08,287
You all were joking so even I was joking.

1909
01:48:08,491 --> 01:48:10,550
I am not going to get trapped easily.

1910
01:48:11,027 --> 01:48:11,959
Hey!

1911
01:48:12,161 --> 01:48:14,026
Have you become blind along with
being dumb and deaf?

1912
01:48:14,230 --> 01:48:16,630
Sorry, buddy! I didn't see it.
Now will your father wash these clothes?

1913
01:48:16,833 --> 01:48:19,529
It was just a mistake.
- I will kill you. Sorry.

1914
01:48:22,171 --> 01:48:27,131
Whatever loan my son had
taken has been repaid.

1915
01:48:29,679 --> 01:48:34,082
He fulfilled all the promises
he had made.

1916
01:48:36,085 --> 01:48:40,146
He couldn't fulfil one wish,
which he had made to you.

1917
01:48:41,624 --> 01:48:43,216
No what will you do by staying here?

1918
01:48:44,627 --> 01:48:46,561
In front of you your
entire life is there.

1919
01:48:48,197 --> 01:48:50,495
It is just the matter of one 'Mangalsutra'...

1920
01:48:51,133 --> 01:48:52,998
...which he didn't tie around my neck.

1921
01:48:55,738 --> 01:48:59,367
But I was always meant for him.
Since childhood.

1922
01:49:02,445 --> 01:49:03,707
Bygones are bygones.

1923
01:49:04,981 --> 01:49:06,209
Forget everything.

1924
01:49:06,549 --> 01:49:08,847
It is not that I haven't tried.

1925
01:49:09,719 --> 01:49:11,346
But it is just not possible.

1926
01:49:12,755 --> 01:49:16,851
From this body my soul can go away
but not Jeet's memories.

1927
01:49:17,059 --> 01:49:19,653
Dear, you have the right
to live your life.

1928
01:49:20,496 --> 01:49:25,763
At least give me so much right
to live as Jeet's widow.

1929
01:49:26,903 --> 01:49:31,272
This is where my happiness lies of
being Jeet's widow.

1930
01:50:08,110 --> 01:50:09,304
Are you teasing me?

1931
01:50:19,355 --> 01:50:22,324
It has fallen... it has fallen.

1932
01:50:27,296 --> 01:50:29,264
It has fallen... it has fallen.

1933
01:50:30,066 --> 01:50:32,034
This heart has fallen in love with you.

1934
01:50:32,735 --> 01:50:34,896
Oh beloved! Oh beloved!

1935
01:50:42,912 --> 01:50:44,174
You have written it very well.

1936
01:50:44,380 --> 01:50:45,574
But for whom is it?

1937
01:50:48,317 --> 01:50:49,341
For me?

1938
01:50:50,186 --> 01:50:53,349
Good. I have at least helped you
in writing your poetry.

1939
01:50:53,856 --> 01:50:56,723
By the way, how come this became
your hobby suddenly?

1940
01:51:03,032 --> 01:51:03,828
Deer?

1941
01:51:06,002 --> 01:51:06,730
No.

1942
01:51:07,436 --> 01:51:08,130
Listen...

1943
01:51:12,074 --> 01:51:13,405
Was she calling me a monkey?

1944
01:51:18,114 --> 01:51:18,739
No, no.

1945
01:51:31,427 --> 01:51:32,257
What is it?

1946
01:51:33,529 --> 01:51:38,489
If I show you something then
will you tell me what it is?

1947
01:51:39,535 --> 01:51:40,194
What do you want to show?

1948
01:51:50,980 --> 01:51:52,072
One I will give you!

1949
01:51:52,281 --> 01:51:52,906
After getting beaten up so many times...

1950
01:51:53,115 --> 01:51:53,843
...you haven't come on the right track.

1951
01:51:54,050 --> 01:51:56,575
If you do this act again then
you will get beaten up badly.

1952
01:51:56,786 --> 01:51:57,684
Remember that!

1953
01:51:57,887 --> 01:51:59,184
The fool!

1954
01:53:39,488 --> 01:53:42,855
It has fallen... it has fallen.

1955
01:53:43,058 --> 01:53:46,653
This heart has fallen in love with you.

1956
01:53:46,862 --> 01:53:51,299
Oh beloved! Oh beloved!

1957
01:53:51,500 --> 01:53:55,231
I have been captivated...
I have been captivated.

1958
01:53:55,437 --> 01:53:58,838
Your allure has captivated me.

1959
01:53:59,041 --> 01:54:03,876
Oh beloved! Oh beloved!

1960
01:54:04,079 --> 01:54:09,142
When I saw you for the first time.

1961
01:54:09,351 --> 01:54:14,050
I lost my senses and
I didn't know where I was.

1962
01:54:14,256 --> 01:54:17,589
It has fallen... it has fallen.

1963
01:54:17,793 --> 01:54:21,490
This heart has fallen in love with you.

1964
01:54:21,697 --> 01:54:26,259
Oh beloved! Oh beloved!

1965
01:54:26,468 --> 01:54:30,234
I have been captivated...
I have been captivated.

1966
01:54:30,439 --> 01:54:34,876
Your allure has captivated me.

1967
01:54:35,077 --> 01:54:38,843
Oh beloved! Oh beloved!

1968
01:55:04,740 --> 01:55:08,870
I had never thought that
this would happen one day.

1969
01:55:09,078 --> 01:55:12,775
I will find the lover of my dreams.

1970
01:55:12,982 --> 01:55:17,043
Now even thorns seem like
flower buds to me.

1971
01:55:17,253 --> 01:55:21,781
This desire has come in my heart.

1972
01:55:21,991 --> 01:55:25,483
It has fallen... it has fallen.

1973
01:55:25,694 --> 01:55:29,255
This heart has fallen in love with you.

1974
01:55:29,465 --> 01:55:34,266
Oh beloved! Oh beloved!

1975
01:55:58,394 --> 01:56:02,262
What effect have the desires had on me?

1976
01:56:02,464 --> 01:56:06,298
Wherever I see, I see only you, beloved.

1977
01:56:06,502 --> 01:56:10,495
My silence has become a
language in its own.

1978
01:56:10,706 --> 01:56:15,143
My fervor has now become a saga.

1979
01:56:15,344 --> 01:56:18,939
It has fallen... it has fallen.

1980
01:56:19,148 --> 01:56:22,640
This heart has fallen in love with you.

1981
01:56:22,851 --> 01:56:27,447
Oh beloved! Oh beloved!

1982
01:56:27,656 --> 01:56:31,319
I have been captivated...
I have been captivated.

1983
01:56:31,527 --> 01:56:35,156
Your allure has captivated me.

1984
01:56:35,364 --> 01:56:40,131
Oh beloved! Oh beloved!

1985
01:57:06,628 --> 01:57:08,152
So you don't know anything?

1986
01:57:10,632 --> 01:57:15,399
I know that in Shruti's heart
there is something for him...

1987
01:57:17,172 --> 01:57:20,505
But Shruti hasn't done anything wrong.

1988
01:57:20,709 --> 01:57:22,301
I know my dear one!

1989
01:57:26,548 --> 01:57:28,072
How is he related to Gundya-bhau?

1990
01:57:28,550 --> 01:57:32,418
He... is his nephew.

1991
01:57:36,458 --> 01:57:38,483
How many years is he with you?

1992
01:57:40,062 --> 01:57:42,155
From 30 years he is with me.

1993
01:57:42,398 --> 01:57:44,889
Then what must be his age?
- He must be 25 to 26 years.

1994
01:57:45,100 --> 01:57:46,226
Not more than that.

1995
01:57:48,837 --> 01:57:51,772
The calculations are not right, Gundya.

1996
01:57:52,107 --> 01:57:56,874
I... I got scared.

1997
01:57:58,147 --> 01:58:01,275
Whenever I get scared the
accounts get messed up.

1998
01:58:02,117 --> 01:58:04,642
But why are we arguing with his age?

1999
01:58:05,020 --> 01:58:06,044
How much do you want it to be?

2000
01:58:06,255 --> 01:58:08,689
We will keep it that much.
That will be fine, right?

2001
01:58:08,891 --> 01:58:09,448
You just tell me the figure.

2002
01:58:09,658 --> 01:58:13,059
I want to know everything
about him.

2003
01:58:13,262 --> 01:58:15,389
About his parents,
about his family.

2004
01:58:16,265 --> 01:58:18,495
No, don't ask me about that.

2005
01:58:19,334 --> 01:58:21,632
I can't even say anything about that.

2006
01:58:22,204 --> 01:58:25,367
I am only everything to him.
His parents, everything.

2007
01:58:25,707 --> 01:58:28,141
Did he do anything wrong?

2008
01:58:28,377 --> 01:58:29,674
Gundya, you know my sister very well.

2009
01:58:30,379 --> 01:58:34,873
Many alliances come for her
but all are just after her wealth.

2010
01:58:36,018 --> 01:58:38,350
After they get the wealth she will
just be a burden for them.

2011
01:58:39,054 --> 01:58:41,545
I want that she should get married
to a boy who is like her.

2012
01:58:42,091 --> 01:58:44,184
So that none of them should be a
burden to each other.

2013
01:58:44,393 --> 01:58:45,655
They should live happily.

2014
01:58:46,628 --> 01:58:49,961
Can you... help me?

2015
01:58:51,233 --> 01:58:54,896
You are right. But where will you
find such a boy?

2016
01:58:55,104 --> 01:58:58,301
And I don't know any other Gujarati
apart from you.

2017
01:58:58,574 --> 01:59:01,600
Do you have any boy in mind? - Yes.

2018
01:59:02,311 --> 01:59:05,610
But he is not a Gujarati.
He is your nephew.

2019
01:59:06,215 --> 01:59:07,182
Will you give him to me?

2020
01:59:07,783 --> 01:59:09,045
And anyways I don't believe in Hindi...

2021
01:59:09,251 --> 01:59:11,845
...Marathi, Gujarati,
Bengali discrimination.

2022
01:59:15,624 --> 01:59:18,718
You mean... marriage.

2023
01:59:20,095 --> 01:59:23,496
Think of it. Then let me know.

2024
01:59:35,944 --> 01:59:38,811
Who are they to fix my marriage
without asking me?

2025
01:59:39,014 --> 01:59:40,538
Your uncle. - He must be your uncle.

2026
01:59:40,749 --> 01:59:41,807
It is my marriage.
I should at least be asked.

2027
01:59:42,017 --> 01:59:43,746
If they ask you then you
won't be able to hear it.

2028
01:59:43,952 --> 01:59:46,716
And if you hear it then
you can't even speak. - So!

2029
01:59:46,922 --> 01:59:48,787
So then all of us together
took the decision. - Bandya!

2030
01:59:49,424 --> 01:59:50,823
You are not understanding
the situation.

2031
01:59:51,160 --> 01:59:53,025
What is there to understand in this?

2032
01:59:53,228 --> 01:59:55,526
If you keep quiet then
you will get married.

2033
01:59:55,731 --> 01:59:57,961
And if you open your mouth
then you will automatically die.

2034
01:59:58,167 --> 01:59:59,657
Now amongst these which condition
do you want?

2035
01:59:59,868 --> 02:00:01,529
That you decide!
- Bandya, listen to me...

2036
02:00:05,941 --> 02:00:07,841
You don't need to think.

2037
02:00:08,810 --> 02:00:10,334
This can never happen.

2038
02:00:11,914 --> 02:00:13,973
This relation is not worthy for us!

2039
02:00:14,449 --> 02:00:15,848
Who knows from where he has come!

2040
02:00:16,485 --> 02:00:17,782
After waiting for such a long time, you...

2041
02:00:17,986 --> 02:00:20,580
...have found 'this' guy
for your dear sister?

2042
02:00:20,923 --> 02:00:25,087
I wanted someone who understands
and loves her.

2043
02:00:25,627 --> 02:00:27,117
I didn't think of anything
beyond that.

2044
02:00:27,329 --> 02:00:29,058
Only love is not everything.

2045
02:00:29,464 --> 02:00:30,658
She has to live too.

2046
02:00:30,999 --> 02:00:31,863
She can't speak.

2047
02:00:32,067 --> 02:00:34,058
And the person who is supposed to...

2048
02:00:34,269 --> 02:00:35,065
...marry her he can neither
speak nor hear.

2049
02:00:35,270 --> 02:00:36,532
Then how will they live?

2050
02:00:36,939 --> 02:00:38,201
I can speak, right?

2051
02:00:38,874 --> 02:00:40,102
So I will speak for them.

2052
02:00:40,475 --> 02:00:43,137
I have ears so they will
listen for them.

2053
02:00:43,345 --> 02:00:44,676
Are you out of your mind?

2054
02:00:45,214 --> 02:00:47,444
Till now if anyone used to commit a...

2055
02:00:47,649 --> 02:00:49,014
...mistake then you used
to punish them!

2056
02:00:49,218 --> 02:00:51,345
And everyone else used
to accept it. Even me.

2057
02:00:51,553 --> 02:00:53,544
And today you are going
to commit a mistake.

2058
02:00:53,755 --> 02:00:54,619
You will repent!

2059
02:00:55,224 --> 02:00:56,555
Remember what I said!

2060
02:00:56,758 --> 02:00:58,020
You will really repent a lot!

2061
02:00:58,227 --> 02:00:58,989
I will repent, uncle.

2062
02:00:59,494 --> 02:01:01,052
But without any complaint.

2063
02:01:01,663 --> 02:01:03,392
All of this wealth is yours, uncle.

2064
02:01:03,865 --> 02:01:05,127
I will give it to you.

2065
02:01:05,334 --> 02:01:06,699
I will go away empty handed.

2066
02:01:07,302 --> 02:01:08,735
But I only want that
my sister's marriage...

2067
02:01:08,971 --> 02:01:11,565
...should take place in this
wedding tent itself.

2068
02:01:13,609 --> 02:01:14,234
What?

2069
02:01:15,210 --> 02:01:16,177
What did you say?

2070
02:01:18,380 --> 02:01:19,904
What... did you say?

2071
02:01:21,283 --> 02:01:23,877
You will leave all this property, which...

2072
02:01:24,086 --> 02:01:26,680
...you have earned yourself
just like that!

2073
02:01:27,322 --> 02:01:30,257
What is the use of all this property?

2074
02:01:30,926 --> 02:01:33,224
Does anything else make a difference
to my life apart from you?

2075
02:01:34,329 --> 02:01:37,093
I just want that we should not
get betrayed in this.

2076
02:01:38,066 --> 02:01:39,863
My daughter should not be betrayed.

2077
02:01:40,068 --> 02:01:44,630
No, uncle. I am very sure that
he will not betray us.

2078
02:01:48,777 --> 02:01:49,539
Brother!

2079
02:01:58,120 --> 02:01:59,985
I am not worthy of calling you a brother.

2080
02:02:01,323 --> 02:02:06,625
Brother, till now I wasn't saying anything
nor was I hearing anything.

2081
02:02:07,663 --> 02:02:09,221
But this was my helplessness, brother.

2082
02:02:24,579 --> 02:02:26,103
Uncle, this was my helplessness.

2083
02:02:28,083 --> 02:02:28,981
Helplessness?

2084
02:02:29,184 --> 02:02:31,414
In helplessness only a
person can do this evil act.

2085
02:02:31,620 --> 02:02:34,180
He betrays... he lies... he robs.

2086
02:02:34,389 --> 02:02:36,653
Do you know the consequences of
messing with us?

2087
02:02:36,858 --> 02:02:38,621
Hit him! Hit him!

2088
02:02:59,548 --> 02:03:02,039
Wait! Leave him! Wait!

2089
02:03:02,250 --> 02:03:04,081
Now did you get to see his true colours?

2090
02:03:04,286 --> 02:03:08,313
Now also if you want to get your sister
married to him then go ahead.

2091
02:03:12,694 --> 02:03:13,592
Scoundrel!

2092
02:03:15,397 --> 02:03:17,627
When my sister said that she likes you...

2093
02:03:18,133 --> 02:03:21,125
...then I was waiting to hear
you call me a brother.

2094
02:03:21,703 --> 02:03:24,536
But now I am hearing the same word
from a betrayer's mouth.

2095
02:03:25,240 --> 02:03:27,640
Why did you do this? Why!

2096
02:03:28,110 --> 02:03:29,372
Forgive me, brother.

2097
02:03:29,578 --> 02:03:30,670
I should forgive you!

2098
02:03:32,981 --> 02:03:35,711
I am ready to forgive you for deceiving me.

2099
02:03:36,585 --> 02:03:41,887
But I can never forgive you for jesting
with and deceiving my sister.

2100
02:03:42,758 --> 02:03:44,623
Henceforth you will not say anything.

2101
02:03:44,826 --> 02:03:45,417
Move aside!

2102
02:03:45,627 --> 02:03:46,719
You will never say anything.

2103
02:03:46,928 --> 02:03:47,519
Enough!

2104
02:03:48,497 --> 02:03:51,159
I can bear everything but I cannot bear of
being accused to be a betrayer.

2105
02:03:51,767 --> 02:03:53,632
Your sister knows everything about me!

2106
02:03:54,669 --> 02:03:55,931
I have not hidden anything from her.

2107
02:03:56,538 --> 02:03:58,028
In fact how much she knows about me...

2108
02:03:58,240 --> 02:03:59,571
...that much no one in this
world knows about me.

2109
02:04:09,284 --> 02:04:14,449
If you are right and if she also
is betraying me like you.

2110
02:04:16,091 --> 02:04:18,059
Then from today onwards
I will not have a sister.

2111
02:04:18,260 --> 02:04:22,697
No, brother. You will not
do anything to her.

2112
02:04:24,466 --> 02:04:26,195
There is no fault of hers
in this, brother.

2113
02:04:28,036 --> 02:04:31,062
Today you will have to hear
the entire truth.

2114
02:04:37,813 --> 02:04:38,745
Shruti!

2115
02:04:44,453 --> 02:04:45,920
What were you doing?

2116
02:04:47,289 --> 02:04:49,052
It is not your fault in this.

2117
02:04:50,025 --> 02:04:53,119
Dear, we wipe the tears of every person
coming at our doorstep.

2118
02:04:53,895 --> 02:04:55,419
You also were doing the same thing.

2119
02:04:56,298 --> 02:04:59,665
See... see everything will happen
the way you want.

2120
02:05:00,669 --> 02:05:04,571
No happiness is bigger for me in
this world apart from yours.

2121
02:05:05,540 --> 02:05:09,237
No, dear. Don't cry.

2122
02:05:10,312 --> 02:05:12,644
Dear, Jeet has told us everything.

2123
02:05:13,949 --> 02:05:15,473
He is a very nice person.

2124
02:05:16,485 --> 02:05:18,112
We have full trust on him.

2125
02:05:18,320 --> 02:05:20,185
Till today you must have
lied so many times.

2126
02:05:21,189 --> 02:05:22,622
But at the end you also said the truth.

2127
02:05:24,025 --> 02:05:25,754
I know that this is reality.

2128
02:05:27,128 --> 02:05:29,028
But from today onwards you will have...

2129
02:05:29,598 --> 02:05:31,065
...to forget your past and live with us.

2130
02:05:32,167 --> 02:05:35,864
No one else will have
any right on you. - Yes.

2131
02:05:36,104 --> 02:05:37,833
If you agree to what I say then you...

2132
02:05:38,673 --> 02:05:40,504
...will have to promise me one more thing.

2133
02:05:41,109 --> 02:05:43,236
That you will never leave
Shruti and go.

2134
02:05:44,045 --> 02:05:45,672
You will always be with her
for the entire life.

2135
02:05:46,781 --> 02:05:51,445
If you are sure in your intentions
only then take this oath.

2136
02:05:57,459 --> 02:06:00,292
I will never leave this house and
Shruti till I die.

2137
02:06:02,130 --> 02:06:03,256
This is my promise.

2138
02:06:04,266 --> 02:06:11,035
"This heart has fallen for it!"

2139
02:06:12,440 --> 02:06:20,040
"This heart has fallen for it!"

2140
02:06:20,682 --> 02:06:30,182
"This heart has fallen for it."

2141
02:06:39,501 --> 02:06:41,696
"For the discourses of your love."

2142
02:06:41,903 --> 02:06:44,064
"For the desire of your love."

2143
02:06:44,272 --> 02:06:46,433
"For the boundaries of your love."

2144
02:06:46,641 --> 02:06:48,700
"This heart has fallen for it."

2145
02:06:48,910 --> 02:06:51,140
"This heart has fallen for it."

2146
02:06:51,346 --> 02:06:53,371
"This heart has fallen for it."

2147
02:06:53,582 --> 02:06:55,846
"This heart has fallen for it."

2148
02:06:56,051 --> 02:06:58,144
"For the celebrations of your love."

2149
02:06:58,353 --> 02:07:00,514
"For the discussions of your love."

2150
02:07:00,722 --> 02:07:02,883
"For the zeal of your love."

2151
02:07:03,091 --> 02:07:05,150
"This heart has fallen for it."

2152
02:07:05,360 --> 02:07:07,624
"This heart has fallen for it."

2153
02:07:07,829 --> 02:07:09,854
"This heart has fallen for it."

2154
02:07:10,065 --> 02:07:11,896
"This heart has fallen for it."

2155
02:07:12,100 --> 02:07:14,193
"Oh my beloved!"

2156
02:07:14,402 --> 02:07:16,427
"Listen to what the heart has to say."

2157
02:07:16,638 --> 02:07:24,101
"My heart has fallen for you... for you."

2158
02:07:24,312 --> 02:07:28,772
"This heart has fallen for it."

2159
02:07:28,984 --> 02:07:33,478
"This heart has fallen for it."

2160
02:07:33,688 --> 02:07:35,918
"For the discourses of your love."

2161
02:07:36,124 --> 02:07:38,217
"For the desire of your love."

2162
02:07:38,426 --> 02:07:40,587
"For the boundaries of your love."

2163
02:07:40,795 --> 02:07:45,198
"This heart has fallen for it."

2164
02:07:45,400 --> 02:07:47,595
"For the celebrations of your love."

2165
02:07:47,802 --> 02:07:49,963
"For the discussions of your love."

2166
02:07:50,171 --> 02:07:52,401
"For the zeal of your love."

2167
02:07:52,607 --> 02:07:54,768
"This heart has fallen for it."

2168
02:07:54,976 --> 02:07:57,206
"This heart has fallen for it."

2169
02:08:15,764 --> 02:08:20,064
"The style of the love between us
is very charismatic."

2170
02:08:20,268 --> 02:08:24,671
"Over here neither anyone is like you
nor anywhere else too."

2171
02:08:24,873 --> 02:08:29,469
"All through the day and night
I am lost in your thoughts."

2172
02:08:29,678 --> 02:08:34,274
"Now what is life without you, beloved."

2173
02:08:34,482 --> 02:08:36,575
"Oh my beloved!"

2174
02:08:36,785 --> 02:08:38,844
"Listen to what the heart has to say."

2175
02:08:39,054 --> 02:08:46,483
"My heart has fallen for you... for you."

2176
02:08:46,695 --> 02:08:56,229
"This heart has fallen for it."

2177
02:09:05,080 --> 02:09:09,483
"The intoxication of madness has
captivated me like this."

2178
02:09:09,684 --> 02:09:14,053
"That I can't see anything else
apart from you."

2179
02:09:14,255 --> 02:09:18,885
"Now every moment I just wish for you."

2180
02:09:19,094 --> 02:09:23,758
"You are there in my breaths
and in all the fragrances."

2181
02:09:23,965 --> 02:09:25,990
"Oh my beloved!"

2182
02:09:26,201 --> 02:09:28,328
"Listen to what the heart has to say."

2183
02:09:28,536 --> 02:09:35,908
"My heart has fallen for you... for you."

2184
02:09:36,111 --> 02:09:40,946
"This heart has fallen for it."

2185
02:09:41,149 --> 02:09:50,148
"This heart has fallen for it."

2186
02:09:50,358 --> 02:09:52,553
"For the discourses of your love."

2187
02:09:52,761 --> 02:09:54,820
"For the desire of your love."

2188
02:09:55,029 --> 02:09:57,156
"For the boundaries of your love."

2189
02:09:57,365 --> 02:09:59,424
"This heart has fallen for it."

2190
02:09:59,634 --> 02:10:00,430
"This heart has fallen for it."

2191
02:10:00,635 --> 02:10:02,262
"Come on, dance!"

2192
02:10:22,924 --> 02:10:24,186
Greet me! Greet me!

2193
02:10:24,392 --> 02:10:26,087
I am not just that Gundya sir.

2194
02:10:26,294 --> 02:10:28,785
I am your boss's to be relative now.

2195
02:10:28,997 --> 02:10:30,430
What? Relative! - Greetings, sir.

2196
02:10:30,632 --> 02:10:33,760
Yes, now say that Gundya sir, come inside.

2197
02:10:33,968 --> 02:10:34,935
Gundya sir, come inside.

2198
02:10:35,136 --> 02:10:35,864
Yes!

2199
02:10:36,070 --> 02:10:37,970
This jerk who is kept
by that moustache guy!

2200
02:10:41,342 --> 02:10:45,972
"The moustache guy is
on the other side".

2201
02:10:46,181 --> 02:10:49,150
"Take me that side."

2202
02:10:49,350 --> 02:10:50,044
Boss! Boss!

2203
02:10:50,251 --> 02:10:51,650
Leave my hand! - Don't go inside.

2204
02:10:51,853 --> 02:10:53,218
Go back! Go back!

2205
02:10:53,421 --> 02:10:56,083
Once if Gundya sir puts his foot forward
he never takes it back.

2206
02:10:56,291 --> 02:10:56,814
Understood?

2207
02:10:57,025 --> 02:10:58,890
If you step even one foot forward
then you won't have any legs left.

2208
02:10:59,093 --> 02:10:59,923
Don't go inside.

2209
02:11:00,128 --> 02:11:01,117
Wash the clothes! Wash then!

2210
02:11:01,329 --> 02:11:02,853
I am going to meet my son
and my relative inside.

2211
02:11:03,064 --> 02:11:04,656
Not son, nephew.

2212
02:11:04,866 --> 02:11:06,891
He was my nephew.
Now I have adopted him.

2213
02:11:07,101 --> 02:11:08,830
From whom have you adopted him?
- From me.

2214
02:11:09,504 --> 02:11:10,766
I was his uncle, right? - Yes.

2215
02:11:10,972 --> 02:11:12,064
So I adopted him from me only.

2216
02:11:12,273 --> 02:11:13,262
So I became the father then, right?

2217
02:11:13,708 --> 02:11:15,903
Oh God! Boss, don't go inside.

2218
02:11:16,110 --> 02:11:18,078
Who are you to stop me! Move aside!

2219
02:11:18,279 --> 02:11:20,338
Boss, 'he' spoke. - Who spoke?

2220
02:11:21,115 --> 02:11:22,673
See... see.

2221
02:11:23,117 --> 02:11:23,981
One minute.

2222
02:11:24,819 --> 02:11:26,480
What did you say? - I didn't say anything.

2223
02:11:26,688 --> 02:11:28,280
He said that he didn't say anything.

2224
02:11:28,489 --> 02:11:29,683
Then why did you tell me that
he said something?

2225
02:11:29,891 --> 02:11:31,188
I didn't say that he spoke.

2226
02:11:31,392 --> 02:11:34,520
Then what did you say?
- I said that 'he' spoke.

2227
02:11:34,896 --> 02:11:36,659
But when I asked him if he spoke...

2228
02:11:36,865 --> 02:11:38,059
...then you said that
he didn't say anything.

2229
02:11:38,266 --> 02:11:40,496
Yes, he didn't say.
- And you told me that he said.

2230
02:11:40,702 --> 02:11:44,160
I didn't say that he spoke.
I said that 'he' spoke.

2231
02:11:44,372 --> 02:11:45,930
Hold this. - Yes.

2232
02:11:48,676 --> 02:11:50,644
You will die! You will die today.

2233
02:11:53,815 --> 02:11:55,305
See who has come?

2234
02:11:55,583 --> 02:11:59,144
Come, come, Gundya.
We were waiting just for you.

2235
02:11:59,754 --> 02:12:01,153
See what have I got.

2236
02:12:01,789 --> 02:12:07,489
I have got 'Khakara', 'Jalebi', 'Gathiya',
'Barfi', 'Halwa' and 'Mohanthal'.

2237
02:12:07,695 --> 02:12:08,627
This is for you.

2238
02:12:08,830 --> 02:12:10,525
Have these fried snacks.

2239
02:12:10,899 --> 02:12:13,299
And I have got coconut and sweets.

2240
02:12:16,104 --> 02:12:17,366
Didn't you get sweets made form fenugreek?

2241
02:12:17,572 --> 02:12:21,008
No, that I didn't get that. - Not a problem.
That we shall give you.

2242
02:12:21,209 --> 02:12:22,904
Sure. You will make me eat
with your own hands.

2243
02:12:23,111 --> 02:12:24,578
Will you meet your nephew?

2244
02:12:24,779 --> 02:12:27,771
Yes, call him. - Kanhaiya!

2245
02:12:28,216 --> 02:12:31,811
Your dear uncle has come.
- Dearest uncle!

2246
02:12:36,124 --> 02:12:40,561
Kanhaiya! - How are you related to him?
- I am his uncle.

2247
02:12:40,762 --> 02:12:41,786
But he won't understand that
in this language.

2248
02:12:41,996 --> 02:12:44,430
You will have to explain him
in his language.

2249
02:12:47,468 --> 02:12:51,336
Tea... so uncle.

2250
02:12:51,773 --> 02:12:54,867
Understood? - Yes.
You are my uncle.

2251
02:12:58,813 --> 02:13:02,943
Did I hear anything?
- Yes. How are you, uncle?

2252
02:13:03,985 --> 02:13:04,610
Hey... hey.

2253
02:13:05,486 --> 02:13:08,785
You can speak. - Hey! What?

2254
02:13:08,990 --> 02:13:10,287
My nephew has started speaking.

2255
02:13:10,992 --> 02:13:13,859
My nephew has spoken
for the first time.

2256
02:13:14,662 --> 02:13:18,098
Say. Say something. Say again
for the first time.

2257
02:13:18,299 --> 02:13:19,857
Uncle, this is not the first time.

2258
02:13:20,401 --> 02:13:22,426
I can hear and speak from before only.

2259
02:13:22,770 --> 02:13:23,794
He is saying a lie!

2260
02:13:24,205 --> 02:13:27,140
He is dumb. I swear by my mother.

2261
02:13:28,276 --> 02:13:32,838
He... is making you a fool.
He is acting as if he can speak.

2262
02:13:33,982 --> 02:13:37,816
Tell Seth-ji the truth.
Say that you are dumb.

2263
02:13:38,019 --> 02:13:39,179
I have already told them the truth.

2264
02:13:39,387 --> 02:13:40,547
That I am not dumb or deaf.

2265
02:13:41,689 --> 02:13:44,715
And I also told them that
you brought me from the ocean.

2266
02:13:48,763 --> 02:13:50,321
Now do you have to say anything?

2267
02:13:54,836 --> 02:13:56,463
Whose bone breaking noise was it?

2268
02:13:57,572 --> 02:14:00,097
It has not broken yet.
It is going to be broken.

2269
02:14:08,916 --> 02:14:10,747
Eat all of this and finish it.

2270
02:14:10,952 --> 02:14:14,149
Then Mangal will decide
what is to be done with you.

2271
02:14:20,028 --> 02:14:21,120
Don't do anything to me.

2272
02:14:21,329 --> 02:14:24,196
I am saying the truth. I didn't know
that this dumb guy speaks.

2273
02:14:24,399 --> 02:14:25,024
Really!

2274
02:14:25,967 --> 02:14:28,162
How is he your nephew?

2275
02:14:28,836 --> 02:14:30,463
You know that I am an Indian.

2276
02:14:30,671 --> 02:14:32,832
And all Indians are
my brothers and sisters.

2277
02:14:33,041 --> 02:14:35,305
So he is the son of one of my brothers.

2278
02:14:35,510 --> 02:14:37,273
So then he is my nephew.

2279
02:14:37,478 --> 02:14:41,073
In our India this happens.
I don't know how it is in Gujarat.

2280
02:14:41,282 --> 02:14:42,044
I don't know.

2281
02:14:42,250 --> 02:14:42,909
Is this so?

2282
02:14:48,956 --> 02:14:49,854
Whatever be the case!

2283
02:14:50,525 --> 02:14:54,325
Since you have got him here
so we forego your loan.

2284
02:14:59,200 --> 02:15:03,728
What about the interest?
- That also I forego.

2285
02:15:05,673 --> 02:15:06,662
That also you don't need to pay!

2286
02:15:18,586 --> 02:15:22,113
See, whatever I did I did that
since I was helpless.

2287
02:15:23,791 --> 02:15:27,852
Okay? But your future now is very good.

2288
02:15:30,164 --> 02:15:34,123
Though I am fake, but don't
forget this uncle of yours.

2289
02:15:36,504 --> 02:15:40,702
Today whatever I am is because
of you and Bandya.

2290
02:15:41,976 --> 02:15:45,605
I will never forget this. I will never
forget this till I die.

2291
02:15:56,624 --> 02:15:57,886
Give this to Jeet's house.

2292
02:15:58,559 --> 02:16:00,117
There is enough money in this because...

2293
02:16:00,328 --> 02:16:02,796
...of which his family can live happily
for their entire life.

2294
02:16:02,997 --> 02:16:05,022
I want that they should bless him.

2295
02:16:05,466 --> 02:16:06,933
They should remember him
with a lot of affection.

2296
02:16:11,606 --> 02:16:13,267
Do you want to tell anything
to your family?

2297
02:16:14,308 --> 02:16:16,333
There is no need to tell
anything to my family.

2298
02:16:16,611 --> 02:16:17,942
You know everything.

2299
02:16:18,212 --> 02:16:22,740
I don't want anyone to come here tomorrow
and claim that I am their son.

2300
02:16:23,818 --> 02:16:25,581
Okay, let's go.

2301
02:16:31,959 --> 02:16:33,620
No, we don't want this money.

2302
02:16:35,863 --> 02:16:38,525
Just think that Jeet himself
has sent this for you.

2303
02:16:39,300 --> 02:16:43,168
And even Jeet has a share in
what we earned in the business.

2304
02:16:43,604 --> 02:16:45,663
You only say what should we do?

2305
02:16:49,110 --> 02:16:53,274
You are right. We don't need this money.

2306
02:16:54,482 --> 02:16:55,972
What will we do with them?

2307
02:17:03,958 --> 02:17:04,982
Who is she?

2308
02:17:07,028 --> 02:17:11,465
She is... she is... Jeet's...

2309
02:17:12,166 --> 02:17:13,258
What of Jeet?

2310
02:17:17,905 --> 02:17:19,236
She is Jeet's widow.

2311
02:17:22,176 --> 02:17:22,870
Pooja?

2312
02:17:26,280 --> 02:17:28,578
Yes. How do you know?

2313
02:17:31,819 --> 02:17:35,016
Jeet had told me.
- What did he tell you about me?

2314
02:17:37,858 --> 02:17:39,621
That he likes me?

2315
02:17:41,729 --> 02:17:43,026
You go inside, dear.

2316
02:17:46,434 --> 02:17:48,959
You knew Jeet very well, is it?

2317
02:17:51,572 --> 02:17:53,369
Not very well, but from the heart.

2318
02:17:57,111 --> 02:17:59,011
I wish I had known his heart.

2319
02:18:00,381 --> 02:18:02,212
Then this situation would
never have come today.

2320
02:18:02,483 --> 02:18:04,280
All this is destiny's game plan.

2321
02:18:07,054 --> 02:18:09,716
We also can pacify ourselves with that.

2322
02:18:10,124 --> 02:18:11,591
Keep this money.

2323
02:18:11,792 --> 02:18:13,726
And get this female married.

2324
02:18:14,395 --> 02:18:19,094
And Master-ji, I even tell you that
if you have a little love...

2325
02:18:19,300 --> 02:18:21,666
...left for Jeet then spend the
rest of your life happily.

2326
02:18:21,969 --> 02:18:23,266
Okay?

2327
02:18:25,239 --> 02:18:29,300
So what if he died. See he is at least
at a good position today.

2328
02:18:29,510 --> 02:18:31,910
At least you should be happy about this?

2329
02:18:39,153 --> 02:18:44,113
I said it so many times.
But no one believed me.

2330
02:18:45,426 --> 02:18:50,921
He can be very far but still
I can hear his heart beat.

2331
02:18:52,166 --> 02:18:55,294
Since past so many days I was feeling...

2332
02:18:55,503 --> 02:18:58,597
...that my son is not dead he is alive.

2333
02:19:02,276 --> 02:19:02,970
Sit!

2334
02:19:22,530 --> 02:19:26,057
"Sway and turn around...
sway and turn around... just sway!"

2335
02:19:26,267 --> 02:19:31,000
"Sway and turn around...
sway and turn around... just sway!"

2336
02:19:32,206 --> 02:19:40,875
"Sway and turn around.
Sway and turn around."

2337
02:19:48,055 --> 02:19:52,515
"By swaying and whirling."

2338
02:19:52,727 --> 02:19:56,288
"My beloved has taken my heart and gone."

2339
02:19:56,497 --> 02:20:11,936
"Sway and turn around...
sway and turn around... just sway!"

2340
02:20:12,146 --> 02:20:16,378
"First he got my heart beating."

2341
02:20:17,885 --> 02:20:22,117
"Then very secretly
he stole my tranquillity."

2342
02:20:23,758 --> 02:20:27,387
"First he got my heart beating."

2343
02:20:27,595 --> 02:20:31,395
"Then very secretly
he stole my tranquillity."

2344
02:20:31,599 --> 02:20:36,263
"By swaying and whirling."

2345
02:20:36,470 --> 02:20:41,407
"My beloved has taken
my heart and gone."

2346
02:21:07,868 --> 02:21:09,699
"The eyes met first."

2347
02:21:10,004 --> 02:21:11,972
"Then they felt shy."

2348
02:21:12,273 --> 02:21:15,902
"Then it felt as if our breaths
have stopped."

2349
02:21:16,110 --> 02:21:19,739
"I don't know anything."

2350
02:21:19,947 --> 02:21:23,940
"I don't know how this saga unfolded."

2351
02:21:24,919 --> 02:21:28,753
"It's the effect of your magic that
I have started quivering."

2352
02:21:28,956 --> 02:21:33,518
"I didn't care about myself,
that's the state it left me in."

2353
02:21:33,727 --> 02:21:38,323
"By swaying and whirling."

2354
02:21:38,532 --> 02:21:42,866
"My beloved has taken my heart and gone."

2355
02:21:43,070 --> 02:21:51,136
"Sway and turn around...
sway and turn around... just sway!"

2356
02:22:10,397 --> 02:22:13,992
"I don't know why my heart
has become restless."

2357
02:22:14,201 --> 02:22:17,898
"The desires of the heart
have started increasing."

2358
02:22:18,105 --> 02:22:21,768
"What has started to happen to me?"

2359
02:22:21,976 --> 02:22:25,935
"I seem to have lost my tranquillity!"

2360
02:22:27,081 --> 02:22:28,776
"I don't know what all I think."

2361
02:22:28,983 --> 02:22:30,780
"I am awake all night."

2362
02:22:30,985 --> 02:22:32,680
"My maddening feelings."

2363
02:22:32,887 --> 02:22:35,447
"I just get her thoughts in mind."

2364
02:22:35,656 --> 02:22:40,252
"By swaying and whirling."

2365
02:22:40,461 --> 02:22:45,364
"My beloved has taken my heart and gone."

2366
02:23:33,814 --> 02:23:35,008
Come inside, father.

2367
02:23:37,217 --> 02:23:38,411
No, I won't come inside.

2368
02:23:39,353 --> 02:23:41,253
Whoever you want to say
you can tell them and come.

2369
02:23:42,089 --> 02:23:44,421
Then we have to leave immediately. Come on.

2370
02:23:46,493 --> 02:23:49,428
Father, give me some time.
I'll surely come. - No.

2371
02:23:51,465 --> 02:23:53,660
No, you will have to come
with me just now.

2372
02:23:55,736 --> 02:24:01,231
My son, at this moment don't let me go
empty handed from here.

2373
02:24:02,409 --> 02:24:03,535
Not for me.

2374
02:24:04,578 --> 02:24:06,409
Not even for your mother's eyes.

2375
02:24:07,314 --> 02:24:09,077
The day you had jumped in the ocean...

2376
02:24:09,483 --> 02:24:12,782
...since that day a girl is living
in our house as a widow.

2377
02:24:13,087 --> 02:24:13,917
Pooja.

2378
02:24:15,422 --> 02:24:16,286
Father!

2379
02:24:17,291 --> 02:24:19,122
You will have to think about her.

2380
02:24:19,660 --> 02:24:21,252
About her tears.

2381
02:24:25,466 --> 02:24:28,162
The hands that have taught you to walk.

2382
02:24:30,604 --> 02:24:32,572
I am begging with the same hands
and asking you.

2383
02:24:33,841 --> 02:24:35,741
Today you will have to come with me.

2384
02:24:36,443 --> 02:24:37,774
Dear, don't refuse.

2385
02:24:37,978 --> 02:24:38,842
You haven't met Jeet?

2386
02:24:39,046 --> 02:24:40,172
Why didn't you tell me?

2387
02:24:40,381 --> 02:24:42,349
Jeet dear! Listen to me. He is Verma-ji,
he is a very good friend.

2388
02:24:42,549 --> 02:24:43,982
Greetings. - He has come from Delhi.

2389
02:24:44,184 --> 02:24:46,652
He is Malhotra sir and he is Kapoor sir.
- Greetings.

2390
02:24:46,854 --> 02:24:49,152
Listen dear, the engagement ceremony
is going to begin.

2391
02:24:49,356 --> 02:24:50,983
Everyone is waiting. Come. Come.

2392
02:24:51,191 --> 02:24:52,180
Come, Verma-ji.

2393
02:25:01,935 --> 02:25:03,493
I will get him and come. - Listen.

2394
02:25:04,438 --> 02:25:05,427
Now he is a member of this house.

2395
02:25:05,639 --> 02:25:06,333
He is not your son.

2396
02:25:06,540 --> 02:25:07,666
How can he not be my son?

2397
02:25:07,875 --> 02:25:10,036
I will see who has a right
on him more than me?

2398
02:25:10,244 --> 02:25:12,678
Listen to me. - Don't create chaos!

2399
02:25:12,880 --> 02:25:15,144
Why shouldn't I? I will take
my son along with me.

2400
02:25:15,349 --> 02:25:17,112
I will see who stops me!

2401
02:25:17,317 --> 02:25:18,750
Fine! Then go inside!

2402
02:25:18,952 --> 02:25:20,510
Go inside and ask for your right!

2403
02:25:20,721 --> 02:25:21,983
Do you know what will happen inside?

2404
02:25:22,189 --> 02:25:25,750
In front of your eyes
your son will be killed.

2405
02:25:25,959 --> 02:25:27,756
Do you want to see? Then go and see.

2406
02:25:28,195 --> 02:25:30,026
Go! Go!

2407
02:25:34,268 --> 02:25:37,032
Aren't you responsible
for this state of his?

2408
02:25:40,741 --> 02:25:42,800
Now at least let him live in peace.

2409
02:25:43,010 --> 02:25:44,409
You go from here.

2410
02:25:45,646 --> 02:25:49,480
When you have already accepted
that he is no more.

2411
02:25:49,883 --> 02:25:53,478
Then why do you want to get him to life
and again get him killed?

2412
02:26:03,197 --> 02:26:05,097
What they said is that true?

2413
02:26:13,941 --> 02:26:16,239
Dead people never come back.

2414
02:26:16,677 --> 02:26:19,908
And the people who think
like this are foolish.

2415
02:26:21,115 --> 02:26:24,107
And do you know who is the most
foolish amongst them? You!

2416
02:26:26,553 --> 02:26:29,920
He had not married you then how can you
call yourself his widow?

2417
02:26:30,124 --> 02:26:31,022
Now get out from this house!

2418
02:26:31,225 --> 02:26:33,090
I can't keep you in this house
for even a single moment!

2419
02:26:33,293 --> 02:26:35,625
Leave her! - Get out!
- What nonsense are you talking?

2420
02:26:35,829 --> 02:26:38,627
Now you have no right to stay
in this house. Get out!

2421
02:26:40,634 --> 02:26:42,465
You have seen him.

2422
02:26:47,341 --> 02:26:51,801
You called him. But your son
refused to come home.

2423
02:26:52,012 --> 02:26:52,910
Isn't it?

2424
02:27:13,834 --> 02:27:19,238
Now you got to know how much that
your to-be husband loves you!

2425
02:27:19,439 --> 02:27:22,431
If he doesn't even love you then
why are you living in this house?

2426
02:27:22,643 --> 02:27:24,406
Why are you living in this house!

2427
02:27:31,151 --> 02:27:33,085
We are friends since childhood.

2428
02:27:35,088 --> 02:27:37,147
When a daughter was born in my house...

2429
02:27:38,192 --> 02:27:40,854
...I don't know in which inauspicious time
I had said that...

2430
02:27:41,061 --> 02:27:43,188
...my daughter will go to this house.

2431
02:27:45,632 --> 02:27:47,896
I have got such a
huge punishment for that!

2432
02:27:51,038 --> 02:27:56,999
Now who ever I give you to,
you will have to marry him. Or else...

2433
02:28:00,013 --> 02:28:03,574
Or else I will burn her alive
in front of your eyes.

2434
02:28:04,718 --> 02:28:06,743
And you will have to see that too!

2435
02:28:15,529 --> 02:28:16,518
I am going home.

2436
02:28:18,699 --> 02:28:19,859
To meet Pooja.

2437
02:28:22,135 --> 02:28:25,764
Once we should ask for forgiveness
and take her consent too.

2438
02:28:28,408 --> 02:28:29,773
I must do this at least.

2439
02:28:37,584 --> 02:28:40,348
I will come. For sure.

2440
02:28:41,521 --> 02:28:46,390
But just pray for me that
I have the courage to face her.

2441
02:29:18,759 --> 02:29:19,748
You came back.

2442
02:29:21,395 --> 02:29:23,022
My son has come back.

2443
02:29:24,965 --> 02:29:26,523
Forgive me, father.

2444
02:29:27,567 --> 02:29:29,865
I don't know where
I will go to atone for my sins.

2445
02:29:30,470 --> 02:29:31,437
My child!

2446
02:29:33,907 --> 02:29:35,204
Don't say anything, son.

2447
02:29:36,410 --> 02:29:38,571
If I don't even understand you today...

2448
02:29:39,146 --> 02:29:41,273
...then I am not worthy of
being called your father.

2449
02:29:42,015 --> 02:29:44,415
Come, dear. Come home.

2450
02:29:44,985 --> 02:29:47,954
There are two people in the house
waiting for you eagerly.

2451
02:29:48,455 --> 02:29:50,685
And are living only by taking your name.

2452
02:29:51,091 --> 02:29:51,955
Come, dear.

2453
02:30:02,402 --> 02:30:04,495
Your prayers have got him back.

2454
02:30:16,516 --> 02:30:18,108
Now stop crying.

2455
02:30:18,585 --> 02:30:20,416
From now on Jeet is only yours.
Only yours.

2456
02:30:20,620 --> 02:30:21,518
Isn't it, son?

2457
02:30:21,788 --> 02:30:24,916
Dear, now don't even let her be
in this state for a moment.

2458
02:30:25,292 --> 02:30:28,056
Take this vermilion and put it
on her forehead.

2459
02:30:40,273 --> 02:30:41,399
Tomorrow is my marriage.

2460
02:30:48,882 --> 02:30:52,682
I was helpless. I had to repay loans.

2461
02:30:53,153 --> 02:30:57,647
For your happiness and peace
I sold myself over there.

2462
02:30:59,693 --> 02:31:02,685
Now I don't belong to you all.
I am theirs now.

2463
02:31:03,230 --> 02:31:09,396
Look, dear. She is not an ordinary girl
who is just waiting.

2464
02:31:10,837 --> 02:31:13,829
She has foregone all the joys of life...

2465
02:31:14,207 --> 02:31:16,402
...and is living the life of a widow.

2466
02:31:17,177 --> 02:31:18,508
Your widow!

2467
02:31:19,346 --> 02:31:22,338
If even a tear drop of hers falls in the...

2468
02:31:22,582 --> 02:31:24,550
...courtyard of this house then
even God won't forgive you.

2469
02:31:24,885 --> 02:31:28,787
By letting go of your parents,
by leaving...

2470
02:31:28,989 --> 02:31:30,456
...her in this state which loan
are you paying back.

2471
02:31:30,657 --> 02:31:32,852
Which level do you want to reach?

2472
02:31:33,060 --> 02:31:38,157
If you tell them that someone like me...

2473
02:31:38,365 --> 02:31:39,764
...is waiting for you here
then won't they agree?

2474
02:31:39,966 --> 02:31:42,901
If it is difficult then let it be.

2475
02:31:43,603 --> 02:31:47,004
I was just saying... just like that...

2476
02:31:49,042 --> 02:31:49,667
Pooja!

2477
02:31:49,876 --> 02:31:53,209
Jeet! Ask for what you want!

2478
02:31:53,747 --> 02:31:59,947
I will beg everywhere in the streets
and fulfil all your wants.

2479
02:32:00,720 --> 02:32:02,711
But don't refuse my daughter.

2480
02:32:04,424 --> 02:32:06,221
Don't refuse my daughter.

2481
02:32:13,366 --> 02:32:14,230
Where is he?

2482
02:32:15,902 --> 02:32:17,927
He won't go anywhere without telling you.

2483
02:32:24,544 --> 02:32:28,378
See, you were dead and your family
also was ruined.

2484
02:32:29,216 --> 02:32:31,150
These Gujarati people have
given you a new life.

2485
02:32:31,351 --> 02:32:33,285
They have given you a new life.

2486
02:32:33,987 --> 02:32:37,047
If you forget this then
God will never forgive you.

2487
02:32:37,257 --> 02:32:39,987
Even if God forgives you then
they will never forgive you.

2488
02:32:40,193 --> 02:32:41,990
And if you don't go there then
they will come here.

2489
02:32:42,195 --> 02:32:43,492
Then you think what will happen.

2490
02:32:43,697 --> 02:32:44,459
What is the need to think?

2491
02:32:44,664 --> 02:32:48,327
Pooja is your past and that girl,
your future. That's all!

2492
02:32:48,535 --> 02:32:51,732
Come on, sit inside.
- Come on, sit.

2493
02:32:55,742 --> 02:32:57,175
Nothing will happen by just thinking.
Come on!

2494
02:33:11,958 --> 02:33:15,826
I had gone to my home. - That's all!

2495
02:33:20,967 --> 02:33:25,097
You have broken one promise,
by going to your family.

2496
02:33:26,473 --> 02:33:28,338
Now will you break the
other promise too?

2497
02:33:29,009 --> 02:33:30,806
Of not to leave this house and Shruti.

2498
02:33:34,614 --> 02:33:37,048
Once she has cried on the wedding dais.

2499
02:33:37,918 --> 02:33:40,546
If she again has to go through
this betrayal then she will...

2500
02:33:42,556 --> 02:33:46,185
She will never be hurt because of me.

2501
02:34:04,077 --> 02:34:06,545
From my side a small gift to you.

2502
02:34:06,746 --> 02:34:10,477
It is a ring. But it is very small
it won't fit your finger.

2503
02:34:10,684 --> 02:34:13,915
But when you have your child,
it will fit perfectly in it's finger.

2504
02:34:14,120 --> 02:34:18,386
I can only do this much. Be happy!

2505
02:34:22,829 --> 02:34:23,557
Is the marriage over?

2506
02:34:23,763 --> 02:34:24,991
It is going to start. It is on.

2507
02:34:25,198 --> 02:34:27,359
What! They will go for a walk instead of
getting done with the marriage.

2508
02:34:27,567 --> 02:34:28,226
This won't do.

2509
02:34:28,435 --> 02:34:30,062
Tell them first to get married and
then they can go for a walk.

2510
02:34:30,270 --> 02:34:32,329
So that I can take my wedding tent
with me and go. - Shut up!

2511
02:34:32,505 --> 02:34:34,370
Just eat and drink and go from here. Go!

2512
02:34:36,710 --> 02:34:37,938
Come. Greetings.

2513
02:34:38,378 --> 02:34:40,869
Jeet our Jaipur's partner, Mr. Gupta.

2514
02:34:43,049 --> 02:34:46,985
There are some more industrialists.

2515
02:35:17,150 --> 02:35:18,344
Come, come.

2516
02:35:19,386 --> 02:35:23,083
Jeet he is... he is...
- He is my father.

2517
02:35:28,728 --> 02:35:29,786
He is his mother.

2518
02:35:33,500 --> 02:35:34,990
And she is his fiancée.

2519
02:35:39,873 --> 02:35:41,534
We have come here for her.

2520
02:35:43,610 --> 02:35:45,475
We are taking our son and going back.

2521
02:35:47,681 --> 02:35:51,208
Back? - Yes, back.
You will have to give him back!

2522
02:35:51,451 --> 02:35:52,645
Let whatever happen.

2523
02:35:52,852 --> 02:35:55,150
We will take Jeet form here and go.

2524
02:35:56,623 --> 02:35:59,251
You will take him from here and go?
- Yes, I will.

2525
02:35:59,459 --> 02:36:02,019
I will. Do you have any doubt?
- What did you say?

2526
02:36:02,762 --> 02:36:04,320
You will break my sister's marriage
and take him back.

2527
02:36:04,531 --> 02:36:06,431
Yes! This marriage will not
happen at all!

2528
02:36:06,633 --> 02:36:08,294
If you are not getting a
boy for your...

2529
02:36:08,501 --> 02:36:11,834
...sister's marriage then go and
throw her in the ocean.

2530
02:36:12,038 --> 02:36:13,300
What did you say!

2531
02:36:13,907 --> 02:36:17,001
I should throw my sister in the ocean.
In the ocean, is it?

2532
02:36:18,311 --> 02:36:20,905
You will take him and go.
Move aside!

2533
02:36:21,214 --> 02:36:25,947
You will take him and go?

2534
02:36:26,986 --> 02:36:28,954
Wait! - My sister!

2535
02:36:33,626 --> 02:36:34,957
Stop it!

2536
02:36:35,295 --> 02:36:38,822
If you raise your hand...
- What will you do? - Brother!

2537
02:36:48,575 --> 02:36:49,371
He is my...

2538
02:37:18,371 --> 02:37:22,102
I will not let him go.
Let anything happen.

2539
02:37:23,042 --> 02:37:25,033
I won't let him go away from you.

2540
02:37:51,237 --> 02:37:54,206
Dear, forgive us.

2541
02:37:54,841 --> 02:37:56,809
Give us our son back.

2542
02:38:01,014 --> 02:38:03,505
I was living as a widow till now.

2543
02:38:04,584 --> 02:38:05,983
What will I now live as?

2544
02:38:07,153 --> 02:38:07,881
Tell me.

2545
02:38:09,122 --> 02:38:10,180
You only tell me.

2546
02:38:13,827 --> 02:38:17,058
She can't speak. She is dumb.

2547
02:38:49,696 --> 02:38:53,757
You have taken birth only for Jeet.
Only you.

2548
02:39:00,773 --> 02:39:01,671
Not me.

2549
02:39:11,384 --> 02:39:17,289
I will never come between you both... never.

2550
02:39:41,481 --> 02:39:42,140
Brother!

2551
02:39:49,689 --> 02:39:53,318
We don't celebrate happiness in our
house over other people's tears.

2552
02:39:56,029 --> 02:40:01,990
We are ready to give our life
to wipe someone's tears.

2553
02:40:03,903 --> 02:40:06,997
It is our blood that runs in her veins.

2554
02:40:09,609 --> 02:40:10,974
Today she also has got this opportunity.

2555
02:40:51,351 --> 02:40:52,181
Let's go.

2556
02:41:00,960 --> 02:41:04,396
That dumb girl can't even speak out
the pain of her heart and weep.

2557
02:41:05,565 --> 02:41:07,499
Don't leave her and go.

2558
02:41:10,203 --> 02:41:11,363
We don't want to achieve anything...

2559
02:41:11,571 --> 02:41:13,334
...by taking the curse of this family on us.

2560
02:41:14,540 --> 02:41:18,601
I will not curse you.
None of us will curse you.

2561
02:41:25,451 --> 02:41:27,351
Now I won't give you more sadness.

2562
02:41:33,459 --> 02:41:35,723
I will not live like a widow.

2563
02:41:41,668 --> 02:41:44,034
If you will give that dumb girl
a life then...

2564
02:41:47,473 --> 02:41:52,172
...in my heart there will be
more respect for you.

2565
02:41:53,479 --> 02:41:55,276
I am saying this from a true heart.

2566
02:42:05,224 --> 02:42:09,160
The marriage has taken place!
The marriage has taken place!

2567
02:42:09,362 --> 02:42:12,195
I got my wedding tent back!
