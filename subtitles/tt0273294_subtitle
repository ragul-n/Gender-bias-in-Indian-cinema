3
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:14,850
- I say victory will be mine.
- No, it will be mine.

4
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,710
This is why I say victory is mine...
is only mine.

5
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,866
Mister, I'm not talking about me,
I'm talking about my stick.

6
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,000
Did you think I was
talking about you?

7
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,380
Really? Is that so?
Then beware...

8
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,550
Munimji? Hey, Munimji!

9
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,750
- Yes, Madam?
- Has Vijay gone to the station to fetch Ratan?

10
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:45,500
Him? He must be in the garden
fighting with Jeet.

11
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:50,410
I hope he doesn't lose track of time.
Go, call him.

12
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,220
I'll go right now and
remind Vijay babu.

13
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:04,110
I'm blessed, O God. Your compassion
lets me see Ratan after so many days.

14
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:12,430
- Hey, Vijay, Vijay!
- What's the matter, Munimji?

15
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,160
Are you going to
stay here fighting?

16
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:17,210
You've to go to the station to
fetch Ratan babu. It's getting late.

17
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,620
Oh, I forgot about that! I've to go to
the station, Jeet. I'll have to hurry.

18
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,380
- I'll change and come too.
- Yes. - Jeet?

19
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,890
Mother... Mother!
What could I have done?

20
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,340
See how I'm running late because
of Jeet. But I'm leaving now.

21
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,200
Change your clothes first,
you silly boy.

22
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,980
Your brother is coming
from America.

23
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,036
- What will he say if he sees you in these clothes?
- It's alright, mother.

24
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,340
- The coach is waiting outside.
- Then let's go.

25
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,700
- Mother, where's my waistcoat?
- Waistcoat?

26
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:46,710
Here it is. Careless fellow.

27
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,290
He can't even take care
of his own things.

28
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,530
Mother, you're here to
take care of everything.

29
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,800
- Where's my watch?
- Look in your pocket.

30
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:04,440
- Dear God, how late we are! I say, let's go!
- Come on, go quickly!

31
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,390
I'm going to the station
to fetch Ratan bhaiyya.

32
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,060
Oh... uncle! Namaste.

33
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,960
You said...
May you live long, my son.

34
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:18,250
Oh, you're going to the station?
You haven't left yet? Hurry up!

35
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,760
Come, come, Thakur saheb. Ratan babu
is coming today, isn't he?

36
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:27,330
- It's a day of great, great happiness!
- You said it!

37
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,500
That's why I've come too.

38
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:41,056
Please come, Mr. Kalyan Singh.
Have you come alone?

39
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,940
Didn't Jeet come with you?
It's a joyful day today.

40
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:48,050
You speak the truth.
It's truly a joyful day.

41
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:51,480
Jeet was here from the morning.
She's just gone home.

42
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,100
- She'll come as soon as she changes.
- Please come.

43
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,380
- But...
- But what are you worried about, Thakur saheb?

44
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,750
What can I say? My daughters
are growing up.

45
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:04,380
- I do have to think about that.
- What's there to worry about?

46
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,570
It's a family matter.
All will end well.

47
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,990
- You speak the truth...
- Please come.

48
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,590
- Namaste.
- Namaste. Please come.

49
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,780
Oh, look, the Lord is just
strolling in. Wait!

50
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,610
- Forgive me, brother. I was delayed.
- Delayed!

51
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,940
Do you realize I'd to
walk from the station?

52
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,260
I was delayed because of Jeet.
Come, have a seat.

53
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:32,070
Mother's waiting at home. And the
village elders have been invited to tea.

54
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,040
When there were so many
people at home...

55
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,040
couldn't someone have come
to receive me?

56
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:39,770
- When I was in America...
- But, brother, this is India.

57
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:44,020
And here, elders don't go to the station
to receive those younger to them.

58
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,700
I'm younger than you,
so I came to receive you.

59
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,580
- Come, sit. Put the luggage here.
- Put the luggage at the back.

60
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,120
- Ratan! - Hello, mummy.
- You've come... - Yes, mother.

61
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,260
India will never change.

62
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:26,020
If I hadn't gotten a porter, I'd have
had to carry my own luggage.

63
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:30,930
Forget it. Come inside and eat
something. Everyone's waiting.

64
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,180
Come.

65
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,800
Nonsense. Do we have to
sit on the floor?

66
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,500
You say India is now free. But
the old ways haven't gone yet.

67
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,190
Ratan babu, this isn't America.
It's India.

68
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,300
Our pride lies in
remaining Indian.

69
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:54,080
The freedom we dreamed of...

70
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,850
is one where everyone
is equal and happy.

71
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,700
It's not one where some can
live luxuriously and enjoy life...

72
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,170
while others live in agony,
naked and starving.

73
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,660
Why have you begun such a
meaningless discussion?

74
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,350
Sit down and we can have
a sensible conversation.

75
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,280
Er.. uncle, I don't see Kiran.
Where is she?

76
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,220
Kiran is now studying at
the Agra Medical College.

77
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,390
Oh, very good! You've done
a very good thing.

78
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,880
Now instead of cutting
vegetables at home...

79
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,020
Kiran will be operating on
human organs? Very good!

80
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,970
- It's good you sent her there.
- She'll be coming home for the holidays.

81
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,870
- And Jeet, what are you doing?
- What's there to ask her?

82
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:33,040
Jeet and Viyay treat the villagers'
thoughts and beliefs.

83
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,730
Are you going to stand and talk?

84
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,960
Please sit down and
continue your conversation.

85
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,150
That's sensible.

86
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,480
It's said, brother, that the grass
is greener on the other side.

87
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,350
- There's nothing special about America.
- Nonsense!

88
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,560
Who says so? America...

89
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,800
Oh... America is the
land of wealth.

90
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,650
It rains gold there.

91
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,300
I'm sure it rains gold
for some people.

92
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,510
But we won't let our country
become America.

93
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:15,110
There will neither be capitalists
here, as in America...

94
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,490
nor will poor workers be forced
to work like machines.

95
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,940
Miss Jeet, donkeys can never
equal horses.

96
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:24,850
The fiefdoms that our forefathers
established by the sword...

97
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:28,010
and the wealth they earned, do we
distribute it among these beggars?

98
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,410
Brother dear, times are
changing quickly.

99
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:34,370
The British conquered India
with guns and cannons...

100
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:38,329
but when the citizens raised
their voice, they had to leave.

101
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:43,280
So for how long can the fiefdoms and
wealth seized at sword point last?

102
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,759
And now, our independant government is
abolishing the feudal system too.

103
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:51,640
But... the lands that we have
so cleverly transferred to ourselves...

104
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,390
who can seize those?

105
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:58,370
Uncle, you cannot oppress the poor
by your intellect, might or wealth.

106
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,990
The lands you transferred
in your name...

107
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,320
will be allotted to those farmers
who cultivate them.

108
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,150
Nonsense, who says so?

109
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:10,070
India's poverty says so.
Humanism says so...

110
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,710
and so says the soul of the
Mahatma who freed India.

111
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:19,550
It's best for us
if we become true Indians.

112
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,630
Why argue like this?

113
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:24,040
You know the play you are
performing tonight?

114
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,830
Ratan will understand
your argument.

115
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,620
Be Indian...

116
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:43,630
How can you be so high-handed, sir,
how can you be so wilful now?

117
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:52,590
Be Indian, please be Indian

118
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:07,570
Where're you going, O Madam,
all made up so fine?

119
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:16,690
Do walk carefully so you don't
slip on your high heels

120
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,170
What nonsense are they
spouting, Johnny?

121
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,770
We aren't spouting,
we are just saying...

122
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:28,120
Be Indian, please be Indian

123
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:37,440
What nonsense! You shut up,
you shut up, you shut up!

124
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:42,230
Why're you throwing tantrums,
dressed in a hat and tie?

125
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,500
Don't ruin your country's reputation
when you earn your money here

126
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,770
Wear your traditional clothes,
speak your native tongue

127
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:09,840
Be Indian, please be Indian

128
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:27,420
These inconsequential things
are dear to my heart

129
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,040
Fashion is my life

130
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,390
We will not renounce these

131
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:43,410
and so we are determined

132
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,350
Really? Is that so?

133
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:52,770
Remove your hat, O babuji,
and listen to what I say

134
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:01,950
The Britishers' train
has left for London

135
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:15,790
You will also have to pack your bags
if you don't listen to your nation

136
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:25,000
Be Indian, please be Indian

137
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,700
- Nonsense!
- Please sit down, brother.

138
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,270
- Why, do you want to insult me?
- Ratan!

139
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:39,000
Mother, I'm being insulted in public.
I can't tolerate that.

140
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,810
- Son, it's just a play.
- A play?

141
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,220
Jeet is using the play
to humiliate me.

142
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,480
- I won't stand for this.
- Ratan!

143
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:53,190
Whatever you say, Vijay,
I can't stand Ratan babu's attitude.

144
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,120
It's because he's
freshly arrived from America.

145
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,246
He's aping them so much
he's forgotten his own individuality.

146
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,090
No, your analogy is incorrect.

147
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,240
If the Americans are good,
we're better.

148
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:07,270
The Americans may be anything,
but Ratan babu is a wannabe.

149
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,270
- Jeet!
- Am I wrong?

150
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:13,530
Did you hear that, mother? I'm
being insulted over and over again...

151
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,690
- and you think I shouldn't be hurt?
- No, Ratan...

152
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,910
Jeet is an intelligent woman.

153
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:21,746
You really should change
your attitude and your behavior.

154
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:24,520
Nonsense. Mother, are you
blaming me too?

155
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,650
- I'll take care of both of them.
- Ratan!

156
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,180
Did you see that, Jeet?
My brother is angry.

157
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,670
But it's not wrong
to speak the truth.

158
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,250
Whatever he is, it's not right that
brothers are at odds with each other.

159
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,790
Hey, Kalwa... why are you
loitering here?

160
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,500
Place my things carefully; I'm going
to visit my sister, Jeet.

161
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,540
- Hello, Kiran!
- Hello... Ratan babu!

162
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,040
- When did you return from America?
- That's an old story.

163
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,620
- Tell me, when did you come?
- I've just arrived.

164
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,290
- Have you learned how to brandish a knife near the heart?
- What?

165
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,750
I mean, have you completed
your medical studies?

166
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:11,400
I'm still studying. Papa had
sent a cable...

167
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,790
and I had to come.
It's very bad of him.

168
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,950
- Nonsense! It's a good thing.
- What?

169
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:19,520
- I need you here.
- Oh? You need me?

170
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:22,670
- Why, are you ill?
- No, I'm perfectly fine...

171
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,480
- but I need you to treat Vijay.
- Vijay? What happened to him?

172
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,856
Er... now you're here, you will
slowly understand everything.

173
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,030
- Oh, alright.
- But do beware of the patient.

174
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:36,650
You don't want to fall ill
treating him.

175
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:40,550
No, no, Ratan babu.
I can look after myself.

176
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,010
- Oh... good! ls Thakur saab in?
- Oh, yes.

177
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:55,480
Uncle, I tell you, you should
agree to my request.

178
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,310
My dear, it's a
reasonable request.

179
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:03,370
But... your mother...

180
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,200
wants Jeet to marry Vijay.

181
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,080
Nonsense. Who says Vijay
has to marry Jeet?

182
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:12,650
Just so the wealth of both families
can be used for social welfare?

183
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:17,960
That's a fact but, my dear sir,
what can I do?

184
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:22,800
You can do everything, uncle,
if you'll only act sensibly.

185
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:25,460
Yes, the matter can be
handled sensibly...

186
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,000
if we can find two
sensible people.

187
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,000
Nonsense! Who says
we're not sensible?

188
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,850
That's reasonable. But, my dear,
why are you trying to convince me?

189
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:37,910
This is something
you should understand.

190
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,610
Didn't you get it?
I've to think of Kiran, too.

191
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:46,090
If I marry Jeet off to you...

192
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:50,770
then all this wealth will be yours.
What will I have then?

193
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:53,770
Nonsense. Who says
you won't have anything?

194
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:57,710
Uncle, I'll do exactly
as you say.

195
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,570
- It's a family matter after all.
- Now that's a sensible speech!

196
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,810
But, my dear... you understand
what I... I mean...

197
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:06,326
I mean, you understand what
I'm getting at, don't you?

198
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:08,050
Nonsense! I understand nothing!

199
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:11,220
- If you would only make your meaning clear!
- Is that so? Then, come on.

200
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,410
Here... sit down.

201
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,506
- Tell me, what can I
get you? Milk, tea...

202
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,950
- lassi, buttermilk?
- Enough, uncle, no formalities, please.

203
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,600
Yes, this is a domestic matter.
So... my dear...

204
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,950
now everything depends
on your understanding.

205
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:30,130
Jeet's land, property, wealth...

206
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,790
whatever there is...

207
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,470
What I mean to say,
my dear, is...

208
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,360
You understand?

209
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:41,366
I mean, I wish that...
half of everything...

210
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,870
Nonsense! Half of everything?

211
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,080
My dear man, Saint Tulsidas
has said...

212
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:52,710
"It is customary for men or saints to
selfishly love anything that benefits them."

213
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,640
And I, dear sir,
I'm a worldly man.

214
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,580
- And intelligence surely has some value?
- Nonsense!

215
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,940
Who says intelligence
doesn't have a price?

216
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,750
Now you talk sense.

217
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,490
Now, dear sir, it's up to you
to decide what has to be done.

218
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,770
- What can I say?
- Oh, well, well, well, well...

219
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:13,350
It's alright.
Uncle, it's perfectly alright.

220
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:16,890
- You spoke, and I agreed.
- Spoken like a sensible man.

221
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,830
So now, consider
Jeet (victory) to be yours.

222
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,830
But... but, uncle...

223
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:26,050
- Jeet and Vijay...
- You watch my machinations, my dear.

224
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:30,870
If I don't stop their
roaming around together...

225
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:35,240
- then my name is not Thakur Kalyan Singh!
- You said it!

226
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:51,440
However difficult the path ahead

227
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,870
We will continue to forge ahead

228
00:17:56,350 --> 00:18:02,380
Moving forward, laughing, singing,
celebrating each step, we will forge ahead

229
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:21,100
However difficult the path ahead

230
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:34,210
The path on which you step

231
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:42,020
Will be carpeted by my gaze

232
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:47,970
I'll pick every thorn
that litters your path

233
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:59,870
As long as I live and breathe

234
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,976
We will be with
each other forever

235
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,600
We will continue to forge ahead

236
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:16,260
Moving forward, laughing and singing,
celebrating each step, we will forge ahead

237
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,300
However difficult the path ahead

238
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:35,980
You're the only bright spot
in this dark world of ours

239
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:42,650
You're my only succor
on this long, empty road of life

240
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:57,460
My feet will never stumble
as long as you are with me

241
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:01,130
We will continue to forge ahead

242
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:07,700
Moving forward, laughing, singing
celebrating each step, we will forge ahead

243
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,630
However difficult the path ahead

244
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:24,020
We have to strive together to turn
this sorrowful earth into heaven

245
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,690
They are ours, we have to teach
everyone the love of humanity

246
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:50,350
That which shines
the light of hope

247
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,710
We will light such a beacon

248
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:57,580
We will continue to forge ahead

249
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:04,080
Moving forward, laughing, singing,
celebrating each step, we will forge ahead

250
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:09,080
However difficult the path ahead

251
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,210
- Hello, Vijay babu!
- Oh, Kiran.

252
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:15,890
When did you come? You didn't
even inform us of your arrival.

253
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:18,570
Where's the fun in informing
everyone of your arrival, Vijay babu?

254
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,810
I prefer to jump in suddenly.

255
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,950
It's easy to jump in, but...

256
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,320
reaching the shore
is not an easy task.

257
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:27,930
Kiran knows how to swim...

258
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,140
and will swim surely
and easily to the shore.

259
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,910
- You're still wearing Khadi?
- What else?

260
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,710
Hmm... I can see the influence
here as well.

261
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:41,080
If you're interested in designing clothes,
you should meet my brother.

262
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,376
If he learned nothing else
in America...

263
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,400
he has certainly learned
different fashions.

264
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,560
Excellent! I've
already met him.

265
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,390
Say what you will,
the man is interesting.

266
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:53,680
Yes, indeed. He's returned
from America, no doubt...

267
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,390
but is still dreaming
about it night and day.

268
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:59,890
Fine... fine. There's nothing
wrong with dreaming.

269
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,590
Vijay babu and you
have a dream too.

270
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:08,600
Yes, Kiran. We are dreaming
a very beautiful dream.

271
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,670
We dream that these villages
will be paradise one day.

272
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:19,520
I have a dream too.
And I wish to fulfill it.

273
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:22,720
I'm anxiously waiting
for that day.

274
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,640
- Is it that you will open your practice here?
- No, no, Vijay babu.

275
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,080
Aren't there enough physicians
and quacks here in the village?

276
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:32,150
But it's the villages
that need good doctors.

277
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,760
How can a good doctor
survive in a village?

278
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,250
You may not earn much money...

279
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,440
but you will get an opportunity
to serve the villagers.

280
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,500
No, no... money first!

281
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,190
Money is the real power
in this world.

282
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:49,300
Money is beauty, money is love.

283
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:53,330
- Is this what you learned in the city?
- Well, you only teach Jeet.

284
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:56,630
So I was forced to learn
wherever and whatever I could.

285
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:59,470
True knowledge comes from
life experiences.

286
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,160
Fine... fine.

287
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:04,820
Each utterance of yours is worthy
of being inscribed on my heart.

288
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:07,810
Vijay, it's getting late.
Let's get to work.

289
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:10,340
- Let's go.
- Jeet, won't you come home with me?

290
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,070
Kiran, you may go
if you're in a hurry.

291
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,720
- We have a lot to do yet.
- I see.

292
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,380
- Come, Vijay.
- Let's go.

293
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:36,470
- Don't you want to come to work, Mister?
- What do you think I'm doing now?

294
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:39,430
- I'm working right now.
- The work suits you.

295
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:42,360
Seems like you're a
washerman by trade.

296
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:45,950
A servant can do this.
Come on, let's go to work.

297
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,820
I don't let the servants
do my work.

298
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,790
It would be a different
matter if I get a wife.

299
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,770
I'll have to ask mother to
get you a washerwoman.

300
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:59,400
Munimji, Vijay and Jeet
are an ideal couple.

301
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:03,510
I've told you that
so many times, ma'am.

302
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,290
Why are you simply standing
around? Come and help me.

303
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:13,080
I'm not a laundress. I'm
Thakur Kalyan Singh's niece.

304
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:14,960
Every man is a washerman, silly.

305
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:18,470
You mean to say that every
woman is a laundress too?

306
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,230
Yes. Everyone should
wash their own dirt.

307
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:23,540
The dirt of the body, the mind
or of the clothes?

308
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:26,611
If one can't wash their own clothes,
how will they cleanse their mind?

309
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,136
But there are some beautiful people
with dirty minds.

310
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,860
They need someone
to cleanse their minds.

311
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:34,510
Why don't you cleanse
your brother, then?

312
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,310
Time will cleanse him.

313
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:40,590
We should keep ourselves pure.
Hang these clothes and let's go to work.

314
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,630
Will I get a reward for this work,
or will my efforts be in vain?

315
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:53,240
How do I know? Why don't you
ask yourself?

316
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,770
Ratan's babu's numerous bills
are vexing me no end.

317
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:00,490
Some new charge,
a new bill everyday...

318
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,400
I'm in a strange quandry.

319
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:04,230
I'm noticing that too.

320
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,010
First, a person increases
his expenses...

321
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:11,050
and then strays on wrong paths
to fund those expenses.

322
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,230
But why would Ratan babu
worry about money?

323
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,810
He's been blessed
with plenty, after all.

324
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:20,860
That doesn't mean, however,
that we spend it all on ourselves.

325
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,260
One has to think of others too.

326
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,296
Indeed. That's the difference
between Ratan and Vijay.

327
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,010
- Namaste, mother.
- Bless you, Kiran. Come in.

328
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,010
Hey, you've changed a lot.
When did you come?

329
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:38,900
- You didn't even let us know.
- I come like a sudden storm, mother.

330
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:41,400
Now don't go away
like the storm.

331
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,230
Oh... I just might go away
like a storm.

332
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:47,230
Who cares for me
in this village, mother?

333
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:49,980
I've to return to the city.

334
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:55,110
You're a silly girl. Jeet looks
upon you as her own sister.

335
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:57,150
Oh... fine!

336
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:00,940
If not the flower, at least
the thorns have embraced me.

337
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,290
- Er... did Jeet come here?
- Yes...

338
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:06,540
Vijay and she have just left
on their social work.

339
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:09,280
They are immersed in the task...

340
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,300
of making this country
a paradise on earth.

341
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,450
I see. So they want to
create paradise here?

342
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:19,190
Our nation can be paradise...
but only if we each know our jobs.

343
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:24,170
We're free now. And if we know how
to take advantage of our freedom...

344
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:28,850
- then our nation will truly be paradise.
- What has freedom given us so far?

345
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:31,990
Freedom has given us the opportunity
to be the masters of our own destiny.

346
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,766
Now it's our duty to move forward
with hard work and dedication.

347
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:38,260
But... in order to move forward,
we need resources.

348
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:40,000
When we begin to
understand ourselves...

349
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:43,840
when we unite with love
and forget our differences...

350
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,536
and decide to work towards
the progress of our own villages...

351
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,060
then, we'll find the resources.

352
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:50,060
What's the government
doing for us?

353
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,330
Now, we don't have
a foreign government.

354
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:55,840
And so, we can force our government
to acquiese to our wishes.

355
00:26:56,790 --> 00:27:00,500
But we should also ask ourselves,
"Are we doing our part?"

356
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,650
Let me ask an
inconsequential question.

357
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:06,110
Do you wish the government
to sweep our houses?

358
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:10,270
We are free today, and we should
understand the value of that freedom.

359
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,020
So that no one gets an
opportunity to mock us.

360
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:17,470
My sisters, let's prove that villages
are in no way inferior to cities.

361
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:23,050
Set your traditional clothes aside
and start wearing neat, clean saris.

362
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:26,350
Because city dwellers mock us
for wearing traditional clothes.

363
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:29,470
And we shouldn't give them
a chance to laugh at us.

364
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:31,900
Do you wish us to
reject our traditions?

365
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:36,510
If rejecting something
benefits us, we should do so.

366
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,870
Sarees are inexpensive
and quite easy to keep clean.

367
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:43,350
Besides, they look beautiful too.

368
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:48,160
Anyway, please come here
tomorrow at this time...

369
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,336
and I'll tell you
a few more things.

370
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,600
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

371
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:58,260
Oh... Namaste, Vijay babu.

372
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:03,310
- So you came here too?
- Strange. Are you displeased that I did?

373
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:05,730
I would like as many men to
take this path as possible.

374
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:09,620
- But, Vijay babu, I'm not a man. I'm a woman.
- Oh?

375
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,570
So you're a woman, are you?
I hadn't thought of it before.

376
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:15,310
Don't tease me, Vijay.
I see what's happening.

377
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,900
- What are you seeing?
- My defeat and someone else's victory.

378
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:22,410
Defeat... victory...
I don't know what you mean.

379
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,550
You really are very innocent.

380
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:30,240
You can't see defeat and victory,
Vijay babu. You have to feel it.

381
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:33,010
Miss Kiran, I think something's
wrong with your reason.

382
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:36,766
You're a doctor. Treat yourself
before you treat others.

383
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:38,790
- Who's being treated?
- She is.

384
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:44,470
Miss Kiran, your sister, has fallen
ill herself while treating others.

385
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,060
Kiran, if you're ill, why did you
come out in this heat?

386
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,820
You should've rested at home.

387
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:55,000
- Actually, what's ailing you?
- Nothing much. It's just mental.

388
00:28:56,010 --> 00:29:00,850
Oh, I get it. The same thing
that ails Ratan babu's mind?

389
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:04,650
Jeet! Jeet... come,
let's go home.

390
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:07,050
It's very late. Or father
will be angry with you.

391
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:11,550
Don't worry about me, Kiran.
I've a lot of work left.

392
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:17,400
Understood?
Now, please go home.

393
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:19,680
Fine. Just come home.

394
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:24,520
Excuse me, is Munimji here?

395
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:26,410
Who's it? Thakur saheb?

396
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:29,350
Please come in, Thakur saheb.
Please have a seat.

397
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:31,420
- Please come in.
- Alright.

398
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,740
Please have a seat,
Thakur saheb.

399
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,370
Tell me, Thakur saheb,
what brings you here?

400
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:42,260
Let me first catch my breath,
dear sir. Then I'll tell you.

401
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:46,280
So, Thakur saheb, what
will you have? Tea? Or milk?

402
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,530
Munimji...

403
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:52,420
From now on, I won't be able
to drink even water in this house.

404
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,730
Oh, Thakur saab,
what are you saying?

405
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:56,896
What fault did
this family commit?

406
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,990
No, not at all, Munimji.
I'm not faulting anyone here.

407
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:04,470
I want to strengthen the bond
between our two families.

408
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:07,270
I'm from the girl's family.

409
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:10,500
Oh, so that's the reason,
Thakur saheb.

410
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,370
I think, Munimji...

411
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:18,680
- that Jeet's marriage...
- Oh, Thakur saheb, what's there to think about?

412
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:21,350
God has preordained the match.

413
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:24,820
Jeet was born to be the
daughter-in-law of this house.

414
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,500
You speak the truth!

415
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:30,730
Munimji, Jeet and Ratan...

416
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,476
will be like Lord Vishnu
and his consort, Goddess Lakshmi.

417
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,130
Good God, Thakur saheb!
What are you saying?

418
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:39,540
Jeet and Vijay have
already chosen each other.

419
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,630
Children may create a world
of dreams as they wish...

420
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:48,320
but their elders have to
consider their best interests.

421
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,870
Munimji, I wish that...

422
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:55,530
the honor of both houses
remain unbesmirched.

423
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,630
Thakur saheb, if I may ask...

424
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:01,820
why do you fear that
our honor might be besmirched?

425
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,390
Munimji, if Jeet marries Vijay...

426
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:13,210
then, Jeet's property and wealth will be
sacrified at the altar of social welfare.

427
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:16,370
And people will blame me.
Tell me, won't they?

428
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,410
Alright. Alright, Thakur saheb...

429
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:21,940
But what I want to know is...

430
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:25,450
why are you so gracious
towards this family?

431
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:30,790
If that's the case, then why don't you
get Jeet married elsewhere?

432
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:34,760
What's that you said
just now? Munimji...

433
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:40,730
I wish that these two Thakur families
are forever united.

434
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,610
And, believe me, Munimji...

435
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:46,920
Jeet is such a calm,
well-behaved girl...

436
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:51,440
she will be able to rein in
Ratan's more colorful impulses.

437
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,990
Alright, Thakur saheb, alright.

438
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:57,940
If this is what you desire, then
I'll certainly speak to Thakuraniji.

439
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:01,516
Now you speak sense. Alright, this
matter is now your responsibility.

440
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,410
Oh, yes, don't worry.
You may rest assured.

441
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:06,230
- Alright, I'll take your leave now.
- Take care, Thakur saheb.

442
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:16,060
Munimji... was that
Mr. Kalyan Singh?

443
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:21,650
- What did he want?
- Er... he wanted to talk about Jeet's marriage.

444
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:24,720
And he left just like that?
What did you tell him?

445
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:27,930
I told him I would speak to you.

446
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:31,500
What's there to discuss?
They are the ideal couple.

447
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:34,950
Er... so... so... should I
let him know we accept?

448
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,920
Why do you need to ask me?

449
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:43,580
But... ma'am, don't they
need to be compatible?

450
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:48,740
You're a very simple man, Bholanathji.
Jeet and Vijay are one.

451
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:52,440
The day Jeet steps foot into this house
as my daughter-in-law...

452
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,200
Vijay will be delirious
with delight.

453
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:59,700
But Ratan babu wishes that...

454
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:05,100
Jeet marries him. And now,
Mr. Kalyan Singh desires that too.

455
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,270
No! No, that will
never happen.

456
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,730
I will not allow an orphan
to be treated so badly.

457
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:15,680
- I've brought him up.
- Madam! What are you saying?

458
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:22,010
Since I'm responsible for revealing
this secret, I'll not hide anything.

459
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:26,330
This harks back to when
we lived in the city.

460
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,620
You were not with us, either.

461
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:35,290
Ratan was a toddler then. One day,
his father placed a baby in my lap.

462
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,980
He told me that the baby's father
had saved his life.

463
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:42,230
Now, he has no one.

464
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:47,216
I said... the son of the man
who saved my husband's life...

465
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,450
- is my son.
- You're indeed blessed.

466
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:51,530
And from then on,
Vijay was fostered by me.

467
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:55,350
And my husband considered him
his son as well.

468
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:58,900
So, madam, does Vijay
know this too?

469
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,540
No, Munimji.

470
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:05,000
A child who's fostered in another home
always feels lesser than.

471
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:08,620
No matter how much love
is showered upon him...

472
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,900
he remains sorrowful.

473
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:16,310
He was an orphan. I didn't want him
to be burdened by our benevolence.

474
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:19,849
I wanted him to
consider us his family.

475
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:21,170
Nonsense!

476
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,030
Mother, your philanthropy
is strange.

477
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:27,960
You desire to make your
biological son a beggar.

478
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:31,425
And a beggar the master of this house?
I won't let that happen.

479
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:34,849
- Ratan!
- That orphan has become the owner of this house.

480
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:39,400
And he has spent thousands of rupees
on social welfare just to woo Jeet.

481
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:43,150
- What does he have to lose?
- Ratan! I've brought him up.

482
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:45,346
He's my son... your brother!

483
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:48,940
I kept quiet because I thought he was
my brother. But now, I've had enough.

484
00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:52,246
I'm fortunate he's not my brother.
Fraud! Cheat!

485
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:53,480
- Ratan!
- Mother!

486
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:58,350
Ratan bhaiyya (brother),
don't upset mother.

487
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,080
Mother, please allow me
to leave this house.

488
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,710
- What are you saying, my son?
- I overheard everything.

489
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:08,890
Vijay is your son. He will always
remain your son.

490
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,700
But he has to leave
Ratan's home.

491
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:14,360
This house belongs to you,
and then to Ratan.

492
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,530
It was your father's wish
that whatever he owned...

493
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,280
was divided equally between you.

494
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,540
Would you insult
his love for you?

495
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:25,800
I have no desire to insult your love,
or that of your husband.

496
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:29,510
But I want nothing, mother,
but your blessings.

497
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,070
My son...
Vijay!

498
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,290
Vijay...

499
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:45,040
- Er... Vijay!
- Munimji...

500
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:49,300
Vijay, leaving the comforts
of your home...

501
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:52,710
you... are building
a hut here?

502
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,836
I'll have more freedom in a hut
to achieve my dreams, Munimji.

503
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:59,120
But, my dear boy, who leaves
their home in this manner?

504
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:01,590
The world's my oyster.

505
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:07,470
Vijay, in your absence, your mother
cannot even find solace in prayer.

506
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:09,750
Why do you grieve her so?

507
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:11,110
Mother...

508
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,260
I yearn for mother, too.

509
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:18,910
But that which upsets
her biological son...

510
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:20,670
I cannot do that either.

511
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:25,130
Please reassure mother that her Vijay
would prefer to be independent...

512
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,950
and earn his keep.

513
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:31,500
He wants to practice
what he preaches.

514
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:35,820
I know, Vijay, that
you will not be swayed.

515
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,626
But once in a while at least, Vijay,
come and meet mother.

516
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:42,110
- Alright.
- Alright. Then I'll take your leave.

517
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,600
Well, well, Miss Jeet... have I
committed an offence?

518
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,610
- Yes, indeed.
- Let me know my transgression.

519
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,910
Only that I don't want to
speak to you...

520
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:56,060
and yet you deliberately
seek my company.

521
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,630
Why do you hate me so much?

522
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,900
I don't hate you.
I pity you.

523
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:02,670
Pity? Excellent.

524
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:07,630
That was a nice thing you said. If you
pity me, please accept my proposal.

525
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,290
Please allow me a chance
to bare my feelings.

526
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:11,950
Please move out of my way.

527
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,860
You want me to leave you?

528
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:17,290
- Then why did you come to my house?
- I've come to meet Vijay babu.

529
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,770
Vijay doesn't live here any more.
He left the house.

530
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:22,470
- Where did he go?
- Jeet!

531
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,920
Mother... where did
Vijay babu go?

532
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,350
He left this house...

533
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:37,330
He's upset with me.

534
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:39,730
He's angry with you?

535
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,490
How dare he?

536
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,230
Please don't worry.

537
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,440
I know where he would have gone.

538
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,690
I'll bring him home
right away, mother.

539
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,150
As it is, I don't like
this squalid hamlet...

540
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:02,440
and then you want that
I stay at home all day!

541
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:06,440
Should I count the rafters of the roof
or keep filling your betel leaf?

542
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:09,300
No, no, papa!
I can't do this.

543
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:14,470
- This is a hard punishment.
- I'm being punished for the sin of being your father.

544
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:18,260
You flit around here and there.
You don't like being at home.

545
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,990
And there, Jeet is roaming
around with Vijay.

546
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,820
So who is being disgraced
in front of the village elders?

547
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:28,200
Stand still, will you?
I'm the one who's disgraced!

548
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,860
Papa, times have changed.

549
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:34,030
Now, women have become free too.
Your village elders...

550
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:37,620
can't shackle our feet and
keep us bound inside the house.

551
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,040
Uff! It's very late.

552
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:44,410
Okay, I'm going now.
Namaste.

553
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,440
Hey... hey, hey! Listen...

554
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:48,130
Huh! She left!

555
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:56,320
Excuse me, whom are you
planning to destroy?

556
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,270
Someone. How does it
concern you?

557
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,680
Of course, I'm the only one
with such bad luck.

558
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:06,210
Uff oh! So you've come to my papa
to repair your ill fortune?

559
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,980
No, Ratan babu.

560
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:11,480
- Your case is... hopeless.
- Why?

561
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:15,190
Nothing can be done.
Because...

562
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:19,340
There's a 'No Vacancy' board hanging
outside the door to Jeet's heart.

563
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,380
Nonsense! It's a challenge!

564
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,450
- Are you challenging me?
- If you have the guts...

565
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,440
then prove it by marrying Jeet.

566
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:30,250
- [Humming]
- So you can have a clear field?

567
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:32,320
- [Humming]
- To reach Vijay's heart?

568
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:35,580
- Okay, I'll help you.
- No, no, Ratan babu.

569
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:38,500
I don't need anyone's help.

570
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:41,320
Why don't you focus on
repairing your own destiny?

571
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:43,330
Bye!

572
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,290
Nonsense!

573
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:50,120
What a girl! There's neither lime
nor betel nut...

574
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:54,360
- Hello uncle.
- Ratan? Come in, come in... sit...

575
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:59,670
- How are you?
- I'm just surviving.

576
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:03,030
Uncle, I don't know when
you will take pity on me.

577
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,020
My dear boy, what can I do?

578
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:08,670
Vijay has entranced Jeet
so much...

579
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,270
that she bristles at the
very mention of your name.

580
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:14,090
Nonsense. But, uncle,
you are her guardian.

581
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:16,350
You can get her married
wherever you wish.

582
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:20,030
But, my dear boy,
those days are long gone...

583
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,560
when you could tie a girl
like a cow to any post you like.

584
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,550
There has to be a reason
to force her, after all.

585
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:30,630
Uncle, marriages...

586
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:32,700
are always arranged
between equals.

587
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:36,000
Vijay, who has neither
home and family...

588
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:39,750
nor knows his parents' whereabouts...
he's dreaming of marrying Jeet?

589
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:42,916
What are you saying, Ratan?
Vijay is your brother.

590
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,920
Nonsense! Who says
he's my brother?

591
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:48,050
- Eh?
- He's an orphan who was fostered by my father.

592
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:51,540
- Eh... eh...?
- Yes, I learned this secret from my mother only yesterday.

593
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,560
- What are you saying, Ratan?
- I'm speaking the truth.

594
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,810
- Really? - Yes.
- So you've provided me with a reason.

595
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,580
Now Kalyan Singh is a lion.

596
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:02,530
Why are you sitting here?
Get up... go!

597
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,540
Go make arrangements
for the wedding.

598
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,576
Nonsense! First, ask Jeet...

599
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,650
I'll cure Jeet's madness
in a minute.

600
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,490
What madness is this?

601
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:17,670
- Madness?
- You leave your mansion so you can build a hut?

602
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,580
What's this, if not madness?

603
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:21,590
You call this madness too?

604
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:25,276
Those who live in large mansions
consider hut-dwellers...

605
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:28,630
mad. You're the daughter
of a wealthy man, after all.

606
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,800
I think your brains are addled.

607
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,540
When I lived in the mansion...

608
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,460
you thought I was rational.

609
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:40,970
Today, I'm building a hut, and
you think my brains are addled.

610
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:44,970
I don't just think it, I say so as well.
Your brains are truly addled.

611
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,590
My brains aren't addled now.
They were addled...

612
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,440
to think you would walk
the same path with me.

613
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,100
Today, Vijay doesn't
own a mansion...

614
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,530
so Jeet doesn't value him.

615
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,010
- You're of that world, after all.
- I didn't know...

616
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,250
that Vijay would be as
small-minded as the others.

617
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:03,650
Now you know.

618
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:06,070
The rich cannot support anyone.

619
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,290
How can a man who is disloyal to his
own mother be supportive of anyone else?

620
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:19,230
Hey! Vijay?

621
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,290
How handsome you look
building this hut!

622
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:26,390
There's a certain beauty
in madness.

623
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:29,590
- Understood?
- Then make me a part of this madness?

624
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:32,580
Be the boat that sails on
the ocean of my life, Vijay.

625
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:36,000
Then my world will
also be as beautiful.

626
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,600
You forget, Kiran...

627
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:41,006
I'm an unmoored boat
with broken oars.

628
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:42,750
I am still fond of this boat.

629
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:46,520
- I'll repair this boat.
- Kiran, Vijay is not Ratan.

630
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:48,650
You're as harsh as
a mountain, Vijay.

631
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:50,770
- And yet you come towards the mountain?
- Yes.

632
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:53,580
I wish to melt the harshness
of the mountain's heart.

633
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:55,730
Vijay's heart has
already melted...

634
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:58,290
But there's not a drop
of affection flowing Kiran's way?

635
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:00,730
Your touch will defile it.

636
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:03,780
- Am I that poisonous? - Yes.
- And Jeet is nectar?

637
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:07,510
The Philosopher's Stone turns
even iron into gold.

638
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:10,110
I'm not iron. I am...

639
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:14,190
Please go away from here. I've
no use for butterflies like you.

640
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,460
Fine!

641
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:30,490
Oh... hello, Jeet.
Good morning.

642
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,760
- Er... I said, 'Namaste'.
- Namaste.

643
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:38,450
If it please you, shall I get
a few formal clothes stitched?

644
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,790
You may wear clothes
of gold and silver...

645
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:43,600
- what do I care?
- Oh. Of course...

646
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:47,350
You only care about Vijay,
whose parents are unknown...

647
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,576
and who has depended
all his life on others' charity.

648
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,220
Listen, Ratan babu, you're crossing
all bounds of decency.

649
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,310
Of course. Because my words bear
the force of Truth.

650
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:59,190
Why don't you ask Vijay if he wasn't
dependent on my father's charity?

651
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:02,800
An orphan taking such advantage
of my father's benevolence...

652
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:05,950
that he considered himself a heir
to his property? Not only that...

653
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:07,410
he conned you?

654
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:12,540
- Then I've made a terrible mistake.
- It doesn't matter.

655
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:16,150
A person who realises their mistakes
should not be blamed.

656
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,210
It's never too late
to make amends.

657
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:22,140
Without a doubt!
I have to make amends.

658
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:30,020
- But where are you going?
- To make amends for my mistake.

659
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:36,580
Bravo, Ratan!
Jeet [Victory] is now yours!

660
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:44,280
Munimji, hasn't Jeet returned
with Vijay's answer?

661
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:47,130
Vijay is very self-respecting,
madam.

662
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:49,340
He will not come back.

663
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:52,430
Not even out of pity
for his mother?

664
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:56,430
- Is he angry with me as well?
- No, madam.

665
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:59,500
You mean the world to him.

666
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,780
He yearns for you as well.

667
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:07,200
That foolish boy has left
his mother drowning in tears.

668
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:09,450
Vijay!

669
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,620
Jeet!

670
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:36,560
Are you crying, you silly girl?
I've just become whole again.

671
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:38,850
My storm-tossed boat has
safely reached the harbor.

672
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:41,510
Where could I have gone?

673
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:44,870
I cannot live without you.

674
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,220
True love transcends lifetimes.

675
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:15,440
You're my beloved,
my life itself

676
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:21,490
You are the blessings
of the ages

677
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:35,720
You bloom like a lotus
in my heart

678
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:47,240
Your love adorns me
like a necklace

679
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:58,710
You are the deity of
the temple of my mind

680
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:04,000
You are my beloved,
my life itself

681
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:09,950
You are the blessings
of the ages

682
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:26,710
When we meet...

683
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:32,570
it seems like flowers bloom
in heart and mind

684
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:43,520
My hopes and dreams
laugh in delight

685
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:48,800
You are my beloved,
my life itself

686
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:54,440
You are the blessings
of the ages

687
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:13,730
I'm the lamp, you're the wick

688
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:19,470
You are my beloved
of all lifetimes

689
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:30,340
You are my honor,
my pride and self-respect

690
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:35,540
You are my beloved,
my life itself

691
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:41,360
You are the blessings
of the ages

692
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:46,960
You are my beloved,
my life itself...

693
00:48:57,930 --> 00:49:01,720
Mother... you seem very sad.
What's the matter?

694
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:06,590
Is it possible that a mother will not
grieve when a son leaves home?

695
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:10,660
When a mother remains upset with
her son, won't the son feel sad?

696
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:15,910
- Why don't you undertand my grief?
- What are you sad about?

697
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:19,810
Do you think I have no problems?
That I'm heartless?

698
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,350
That I don't need anyone's affection?
I've become an eyesore.

699
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:27,560
- A mother hates her son too?
- I don't hate my son.

700
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:29,460
I hate his vices.

701
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:32,650
But, mother... love can change
a man for the better.

702
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:35,610
You lavished
all your love on Vijay.

703
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:39,070
He became a good man. Give me
a chance to turn over a new leaf.

704
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:43,070
- Do you really wish to change for the better?
- Yes, mother.

705
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:47,230
- If I get some support, I can be a better man.
- Support?

706
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:50,650
- What support do you want?
- Promise me...

707
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:52,850
you will give me what I ask for?

708
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:56,300
A mother can give up anything
for her son's benefit.

709
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:58,880
- I want Jeet.
- Jeet?

710
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:01,370
Yes, mother. If you so desire,
Jeet can be mine.

711
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:05,470
Jeet is Vijay's life. How can I
snatch it away?

712
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:08,960
Won't Vijay sacrifice this much
for his mother's sake?

713
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:14,090
Mother... mother... do you wish
to keep me alive?

714
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:17,730
Then let me have the crutch of
Jeet's support. Please, mother...

715
00:50:18,370 --> 00:50:20,316
Please say yes,
mother, please...

716
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:24,530
How can a mother kill one son
to keep the other alive?

717
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:28,530
Fine! You are casting me
out of love's embrace...

718
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:30,480
into a sea of despair.

719
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:33,850
But mother... Ratan will
conjure up such a storm...

720
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:36,940
in which neither Vijay
nor Jeet will survive.

721
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:41,400
- And mother, this Ratan will also lose himself in that storm.
- Ratan!

722
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:45,020
Ratan... Ratan...
listen to me...

723
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:47,610
Kiran!

724
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:50,930
- Arre, please listen to me...
- No, no, daddy!

725
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:54,450
I won't stay in this village.
I'll return to the city.

726
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:58,020
Go to the city? Do you have
a free bank account there?

727
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:01,780
- Where will the money come from?
- There's no dearth of patients in the city.

728
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:05,170
Even so, if I fall short,
you can send me money.

729
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:08,640
After all, of what use
is your immense wealth?

730
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:11,970
Of what use? Arguing with girls
is a fool's endeavour.

731
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,900
Totally ignorant, but is quick to say
"Of what use is this money!"

732
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:20,170
You silly girl, this wealth is
neither Kiran's, nor Kiran's father's.

733
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:22,760
This wealth belongs to Jeet
and her father.

734
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:25,390
- So what did you do your entire life?
- Whiled my time away.

735
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:29,880
Destiny ordains whether
you're wealthy, you silly girl.

736
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,470
And I cannot change my destiny.

737
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:35,840
Men can only struggle, search
for ways and means...

738
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:39,160
- and I'm doing just that.
- That's good. Really good.

739
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:42,320
- Do strive. Please do try.
- Now you speak sense.

740
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:45,190
If you want money, stay here;
you will get it.

741
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,200
- Alright.
- If everything goes as I've planned...

742
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:50,160
then we will be rich
beyond our wildest dreams.

743
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:53,510
But, daddy... where will
the money come from?

744
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:57,760
You're still a child. Focus on
the ends, not the means.

745
00:51:57,850 --> 00:51:59,950
- Oh, alright.
- You want money, don't you? - Yes.

746
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:03,010
- The money is coming...
- Where's the money coming from, uncle?

747
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:08,450
Money? Heh heh... Money
will come and go.

748
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:13,070
- But where are you going? You can't roam around any more.
- Why?

749
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,360
Until I learned the
real facts about Vijay...

750
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:24,080
I didn't stop you. But now I cannot
allow your reputation to be harmed.

751
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:28,130
Is Vijay our equal in status? You shouldn't
have anything to do with him.

752
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:30,710
Uncle, I wish to respect you...

753
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:34,160
Please don't issue any orders
that I'll be forced to disobey.

754
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:37,720
Then you shouldn't do anything
that will disgrace us.

755
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:41,300
- We have to live in this society.
- I haven't done anything...

756
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:43,510
that will dishonor my family.

757
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,390
So isn't it disgraceful...

758
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:49,270
that you roam around with a wretch
whose parentage is unknown?

759
00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:51,170
Uncle, don't call him a wretch!

760
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,440
You dare talk back?
Go inside.

761
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:57,640
I'm tired of listening
to the rumors.

762
00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:01,360
Papa, you shouldn't have
raised your hand on her.

763
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:03,230
Shut up! Who asked you?

764
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:08,110
Children, learning to read
and write is not enough.

765
00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:11,970
You have to work on
your habits and behavior too.

766
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:14,950
You are the nation's pride.

767
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:19,110
If you become strong,
the nation becomes secure.

768
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:24,370
The nation's destiny is influenced
by the effects of each one's actions.

769
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:27,740
By shirking your duty,
you harm not only yourselves,

770
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:30,110
you hurt the nation too.

771
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:34,030
Our country is our motherland, and it's
a child's duty to keep his mother happy.

772
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:37,890
Yes... it's the children's duty to
keep their mothers happy.

773
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:42,300
- Mother...
- Son! May you live long.

774
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:47,540
- Alright, you may have a holiday.
- Holiday! Yaay! Holiday!

775
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,880
Finally, the mother had to
come visit her son.

776
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:54,820
- Come, let me wash your feet.
- Silly boy.

777
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,240
The servants can wash my feet
and ease its ache.

778
00:54:00,850 --> 00:54:03,460
But only a son can ease
the ache of my troubled heart.

779
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:04,980
Come sit inside, mother.

780
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:08,290
As long as I'm there, no sorrow
can trouble your mind.

781
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:16,500
- Come sit inside, mother.
- No, I'm fine here.

782
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:23,290
- Did my leaving grieve you?
- Not at all.

783
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:27,270
I'm happy to see that
you're happy here.

784
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:31,030
You're teaching the village children
to become responsible men.

785
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:34,560
But... who will teach Ratan
to be a better man?

786
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:37,380
There's no one in this world
who can humanise Ratan, mother.

787
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:41,330
No... there is.

788
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,090
- Who?
- Jeet.

789
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:44,280
Jeet?

790
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:46,880
Yes, son.

791
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:51,660
Your brother can change
if he gets Jeet.

792
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:55,190
Mother, Jeet is my life.

793
00:55:01,310 --> 00:55:02,710
My son is generous.

794
00:55:03,830 --> 00:55:06,140
What can he not give up
to fulfil his mother's wishes?

795
00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:09,760
Mother... Jeet is not a toy...

796
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,490
that I can pick up and give away.
It's her decision.

797
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:16,510
Jeet will listen to you.

798
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:22,830
But mother, how do I tell Jeet
to strangle my love?

799
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:29,140
A mother is returning empty-
handed from her son's door.

800
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:45,440
Tell me, Munimji... is there
a problem with the accounts?

801
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:47,370
No, sir.

802
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:49,680
The fact is, my lord...

803
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:54,600
ever since you've arrived, the accounts
have been problematic.

804
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:59,400
So Munimji, perhaps you should
take leave of all these accounts.

805
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:04,480
- I'll handle it.
- Then, my lord...

806
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:08,150
all these accounts
will only be in name.

807
00:56:08,530 --> 00:56:11,490
- Nothing will be credited.
- Who says I don't know accounting?

808
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:14,880
If you did, my lord...

809
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:19,060
wouldn't you have known
that two is less than three?

810
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:23,950
- Even a child knows that.
- You've reduced one person from this house...

811
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:27,690
and you think you have
benefited the house?

812
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:32,740
I can tell you that when brothers fight,
homes are destroyed.

813
00:56:33,230 --> 00:56:35,870
Forget all this. If you have anything
hidden away, give it to me.

814
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:40,500
- Hidden away? There's nothing, hidden my lord.
- Take it out, quickly!

815
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:43,990
- Alright. You're forcing me,
my lord.

816
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:46,570
May God take care of you.

817
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,300
- Here, take this.
- Nonsense!

818
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:52,820
You give thousands when others ask,
but for me, the purse is always empty.

819
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,680
Give me some more. What enmity
do you have with me?

820
00:56:56,750 --> 00:57:00,250
My lord, can a servant be
inimical towards his master?

821
00:57:00,770 --> 00:57:02,780
I gave you what's available.

822
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:06,500
- Fine, take it from there.
- There's nothing there. - Take it out. Quick.

823
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:13,360
I beg you, call Vijay home.

824
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,480
- Take out some more. Quickly!
- There's nothing left.

825
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:20,420
Hello, mummy. Did Jeet and Vijay
agree to your request?

826
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:27,840
It seems you have returned empty-
handed from your loving son's door.

827
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:33,990
So the son you love most hesitates
to sacrifice for your happiness?

828
00:57:34,570 --> 00:57:35,870
Be quiet, Ratan.

829
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:50,240
Jeet... Jeet, my dear...

830
00:57:56,850 --> 00:57:59,510
- What's it, Uncle?
- Are you angry with me, Jeet?

831
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:06,730
What can I do, my dear? These
villagers don't give me any peace.

832
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:08,950
I made a terrible
mistake yesterday.

833
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:12,990
- You're my elder, uncle.
- There, you speak sensibly.

834
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:16,830
- I've an important matter to discuss with you, my dear.
- What's it?

835
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:20,180
I need your signature
on this paper.

836
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,850
But, uncle, this is
a blank paper.

837
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:28,010
Just sign it.

838
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:30,610
Whatever has to be written,
will be written later.

839
00:58:30,810 --> 00:58:32,110
How's that possible?

840
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:35,690
My dear, there's some litigation
involving our city property.

841
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:38,190
An appeal has to be made
on your behalf.

842
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:41,700
But I have to know what kind of
appeal is being made.

843
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:45,080
My dear, I'm tired
of these lawyers.

844
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:48,430
They have requested that
I send your signature...

845
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:50,610
and whatever needs to be written
will be done there.

846
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,910
The trouble is that there isn't time
to go personally.

847
00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:56,820
- Are you sure there won't be any fraud?
- Good God!

848
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:59,400
Do I want to burn in hell
for cheating my own niece?

849
00:59:01,290 --> 00:59:03,590
- So... shall I sign?
- Now you're being sensible.

850
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:06,140
Is this something
you have to think about?

851
00:59:11,490 --> 00:59:13,080
- Here you go.
- Excellent!

852
00:59:13,370 --> 00:59:15,890
- Well done, my dear. - May I go then?
- Of course, my dear, go.

853
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:19,520
Jeet... Jeet!

854
00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:24,400
- Yes?
- Where's the signature?

855
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:29,060
I used the same ink to sign that
you used to write this appeal.

856
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:30,410
Okay. Namaste.

857
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:37,830
This child has learned
to mock me, huh?

858
00:59:39,050 --> 00:59:41,140
I'll see to her.
Kalwa...

859
00:59:44,030 --> 00:59:45,810
Mister, come, let's go to work.

860
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:52,970
Why are you lazy?
Are you tired already, my friend?

861
00:59:53,410 --> 00:59:58,050
I'm not tired, Jeet. But I've
reached a crossroad in life...

862
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:03,080
where both choices
are difficult ones.

863
01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:05,390
I can't decide
which choice is right.

864
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:08,070
So what's there to worry about?

865
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:12,180
Walk the path
your heart tells you to.

866
01:00:12,970 --> 01:00:14,970
And if that's not right,
you can always return.

867
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:17,570
I'll walk with you, too.

868
01:00:18,450 --> 01:00:22,770
But the dilemma is whether
Jeet and Vijay can be together.

869
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:27,830
There's no power in this world
that can separate us.

870
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:30,680
A very strong power had come
to snatch you from me.

871
01:00:31,990 --> 01:00:35,710
- Which power?
- Mother.

872
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:39,720
Mother? Ratan's mother?

873
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:41,520
Yes... my mother.

874
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:45,930
She said only Jeet could change
Ratan into a responsible man.

875
01:00:46,830 --> 01:00:48,810
- So what did you say?
- What could I say?

876
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:51,070
Mother left saying...

877
01:00:51,730 --> 01:00:53,880
she was leaving empty-handed
from her son's door.

878
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:57,190
Mother said that?

879
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:59,500
And she left?

880
01:01:01,330 --> 01:01:02,730
Where're you going, Jeet?

881
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:06,650
Your weakmindedness
caused you to make a mistake.

882
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:09,700
I'm going to make amends.

883
01:01:10,950 --> 01:01:12,050
Jeet!

884
01:01:12,630 --> 01:01:15,360
Vijay has blinded Jeet
so much that...

885
01:01:15,570 --> 01:01:17,600
she refuses to obey me at all.

886
01:01:17,930 --> 01:01:20,580
Being the daughter of such a
wealthy, respectable family...

887
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:23,340
she's infatuated with a penniless
good-for-nothing like Vijay.

888
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:25,670
She has no respect
for her family's honor...

889
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:28,520
she's also squandering all her wealth
in the name of social welfare.

890
01:01:28,610 --> 01:01:30,240
If our clan's daughters...

891
01:01:30,410 --> 01:01:33,630
behave wilfully, ignoring
the advice of their elders...

892
01:01:33,830 --> 01:01:35,500
how will social
conventions prevail?

893
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:38,886
You're her uncle! Break her legs
if she steps out of the house.

894
01:01:38,910 --> 01:01:40,890
You make sense.
But, my friends...

895
01:01:41,050 --> 01:01:43,770
if I do that,
you will blame me...

896
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:46,800
saying that I'm ill-treating my niece
so I can usurp her property.

897
01:01:47,050 --> 01:01:48,560
So what do you want?

898
01:01:48,670 --> 01:01:50,860
I wish that Jeet...

899
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:53,280
not be allowed to spend
any of her wealth.

900
01:01:53,470 --> 01:01:56,890
And that she agree to marry
the man I choose.

901
01:01:56,990 --> 01:01:58,710
How does it matter
that we agree?

902
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:00,710
Jeet has to agree.

903
01:02:01,830 --> 01:02:03,940
Jeet will obey\nthe elders' decision.

904
01:02:04,410 --> 01:02:06,170
It's good that
you're gathered here.

905
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:08,900
Or I would have had to
inconvenience you. Uncle...

906
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:12,350
give me that blank stamp paper
that you wished me to sign.

907
01:02:13,490 --> 01:02:15,840
- Jeet...
- Don't be afraid, uncle.

908
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:18,320
I'm only going to
do as you wish.

909
01:02:18,730 --> 01:02:22,360
- I've decided that that's in my best interests.
- Now you speak sense.

910
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:25,470
All of you know
my uncle very well.

911
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:29,750
All these years, he's been taking care
of my father's wealth.

912
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:32,820
- But now, greed has blinded him.
- Eh?

913
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:36,660
What are you saying? Why don't you
say you're blinded by Vijay?

914
01:02:37,070 --> 01:02:39,180
But this blind girl
understands...

915
01:02:39,770 --> 01:02:42,440
that my uncle, having counted
the money in the safe for years...

916
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,320
is now greedy enough
to want to own it.

917
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:46,640
Did you all hear
what this girl said?

918
01:02:47,050 --> 01:02:49,890
I want to rescue her and her wealth
from the clutches of this goon...

919
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:53,730
- and she wants to malign me.
- Don't call him a goon, uncle.

920
01:02:54,290 --> 01:02:56,030
He's not yearning for
wealth and property.

921
01:02:56,510 --> 01:02:58,650
Nor do I desire
this wordly wealth.

922
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:01,970
I will renounce my wealth
in front of the village elders.

923
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:04,580
Give up your riches? To Vijay,
in the name of social welfare?

924
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:07,010
An honest man doesn't
require wealth.

925
01:03:07,930 --> 01:03:09,620
Those who are slaves to riches...

926
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:11,880
- I'll give my wealth to them.
- Daddy!

927
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:14,880
- What will happen to us?
- You speak sensibly.

928
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:18,920
- I'm thinking the same thing.
- Kiran... it's good you are here.

929
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:23,076
Listen, you elders... I give all my wealth
to Kiran of my own free will.

930
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:24,760
You speak...

931
01:03:26,370 --> 01:03:27,730
- Come, Kiran.
- Daddy!

932
01:03:28,690 --> 01:03:31,580
My dear, when Jeet is not
agreeable, then go.

933
01:03:33,830 --> 01:03:37,490
You folks saw everything, didn't you?
The girl, she's fiery.

934
01:03:37,990 --> 01:03:41,840
She's exactly like her father,
who was a true Thakur.

935
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:44,200
Oh, so you got taken in
by her as well?

936
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:48,560
I tell you, sethji, whatever she's doing
is driven by her madness.

937
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:50,540
This is all Vijay's training.

938
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,730
Jeet... what are you doing?

939
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:02,240
Does anyone renounce\ntheir
wealth like this?

940
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:05,000
I want to know, Kiran...

941
01:04:06,470 --> 01:04:10,140
whether, without this wealth that
causes family to become estranged...

942
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:13,470
I can be happy and content.

943
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:23,040
Here, Kiran. Now you can
live your life the way you wish.

944
01:04:23,110 --> 01:04:24,510
You're very devious, Jeet.

945
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:26,820
You've kept the most
precious thing for yourself.

946
01:04:26,990 --> 01:04:30,070
- And you've given me worthless junk.
- Are these worthless, Kiran?

947
01:04:31,210 --> 01:04:33,330
What do I have that's
so precious?

948
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:37,520
- Vijay.
- That's true.

949
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:41,540
But mother had gone
to Vijay today...

950
01:04:42,550 --> 01:04:44,490
to ask that I marry Ratan.

951
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:48,430
But that's as it should be. If you
and Vijay can make this sacrifice...

952
01:04:48,790 --> 01:04:50,670
then this fight between
the brothers will end.

953
01:04:51,850 --> 01:04:55,510
Yes, Kiran. I'll put an end
to all disputes today.

954
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:59,440
- Go now, Kiran.
- Alright.

955
01:05:05,130 --> 01:05:08,956
No, no, papa. Do you wish to steal
your daughter's wealth as well?

956
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:10,310
Speak softly!

957
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,320
What I mean is...

958
01:05:13,150 --> 01:05:16,010
- I wanted to keep this safely.
- No.

959
01:05:16,390 --> 01:05:18,200
I will take care
of my own things.

960
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:21,180
But it's risky...
it's a lot of wealth.

961
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:23,980
Papa, you've become very old.

962
01:05:24,470 --> 01:05:26,910
Now you should forget
about this wealth...

963
01:05:27,070 --> 01:05:28,510
and think about God.

964
01:05:28,570 --> 01:05:31,260
- Eh? - isn't that right, papa?
- But where are you going?

965
01:05:31,730 --> 01:05:33,910
I'm going to see, papa...

966
01:05:34,170 --> 01:05:37,940
how this wealth affects others.

967
01:05:38,010 --> 01:05:40,500
- Meaning?
- Papa, you won't understand.

968
01:05:41,510 --> 01:05:43,540
Oh... it's rather late.
Bye!

969
01:05:46,290 --> 01:05:47,830
How times have changed!

970
01:06:03,470 --> 01:06:06,220
- What's your final decision?
- What's my decision?

971
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:09,470
I'll marry some rich guy.

972
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:11,160
Marry a rich man?

973
01:06:15,290 --> 01:06:18,480
A rich man will only marry
a rich woman.

974
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:22,160
Uff-oh... so you think
I don't have any money?

975
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,780
I'm a beggar?

976
01:06:25,290 --> 01:06:26,400
Wow!

977
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:29,850
Within this small bag...

978
01:06:30,390 --> 01:06:33,280
lies a large bank, mister.

979
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,320
- Bank?
- Yes, indeed.

980
01:06:39,610 --> 01:06:40,910
Look at this.

981
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,760
Tell me... do you
realise the facts?

982
01:06:50,330 --> 01:06:51,630
Please give it...

983
01:06:53,690 --> 01:06:56,050
I've to hand it to you.
This is called Destiny.

984
01:06:56,460 --> 01:07:00,010
- But how did this happen?
- Why? Are you envious?

985
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:03,090
All your schemes failed.
Tch, tch.

986
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:04,550
I'm very sorry.

987
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:07,850
- Scheme? What scheme?
- What scheme?

988
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:11,800
To marry Jeet and become
the owner of all her wealth.

989
01:07:12,170 --> 01:07:13,970
- What else?
- Oh, what nonsense!

990
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:18,190
- Kiran, you misunderstand me, too?
- No, no, Ratan babu.

991
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,320
I appreciate you.

992
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:25,230
You are full of life. And Vijay?
Village bumpkin! Uncouth!

993
01:07:26,890 --> 01:07:29,170
- And you...
- Lovely, Kiran, lovely.

994
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:33,040
When you talk, it seems...

995
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:35,240
as if you're singing
a melodious song.

996
01:07:35,710 --> 01:07:37,890
- I wish...
- What do you wish?

997
01:07:38,590 --> 01:07:41,850
I wish I could lose myself
in your sweet, melodious voice.

998
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:43,830
Okay. Then...

999
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:15,200
Laugh and sing, my beloved

1000
01:08:15,630 --> 01:08:18,830
O my beloved, do laugh and sing

1001
01:08:25,630 --> 01:08:30,400
Dance the divine
dance of love with stars

1002
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:31,779
Laugh and sing...

1003
01:08:37,569 --> 01:08:41,119
Laugh and sing, my beloved

1004
01:08:41,490 --> 01:08:44,980
O my beloved, do laugh and sing

1005
01:08:53,830 --> 01:08:56,610
Bearing sweet dreams

1006
01:08:56,689 --> 01:08:59,939
Comes the beautiful night

1007
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:05,226
Each limb quivering
with new desires

1008
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:08,170
of fresh, vibrant youth

1009
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:18,890
Come, let our eyes meet

1010
01:09:18,950 --> 01:09:20,360
Let's laugh and sing

1011
01:09:25,930 --> 01:09:29,480
Laugh and sing, my beloved

1012
01:09:29,899 --> 01:09:33,249
O my beloved, do laugh and sing

1013
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:44,680
The whole world laughs

1014
01:09:44,710 --> 01:09:47,750
When you come and smile

1015
01:09:50,550 --> 01:09:52,940
The beats of my heart tell me

1016
01:09:53,010 --> 01:09:55,700
Someone's creeping into my heart

1017
01:09:59,380 --> 01:10:03,800
Who will guard my heart now?

1018
01:10:03,910 --> 01:10:05,350
Let's laugh and sing

1019
01:10:10,850 --> 01:10:14,450
Laigh and sing, my beloved

1020
01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:17,930
O my beloved, do laugh and sing

1021
01:10:34,110 --> 01:10:37,710
- Jeet, where are you going?
- I was coming to you.

1022
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:41,040
- You were upset with me yesterday.
- No.

1023
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:45,280
- Come with me. I'll show you a farce.
- Farce?

1024
01:10:45,810 --> 01:10:48,170
Yes. The farce of this world.

1025
01:10:49,090 --> 01:10:51,770
I've unburdened myself of my wealth.

1026
01:10:52,490 --> 01:10:54,700
And now, I wish to lift
the burden off your shoulder.

1027
01:10:54,830 --> 01:10:56,280
- My burden?
- Yes.

1028
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:58,770
Your are troubled by the fact...

1029
01:10:59,410 --> 01:11:02,120
that your mother left
empty-handed from your door.

1030
01:11:02,890 --> 01:11:05,210
- Come with me.
- Lord knows what you intend doing.

1031
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:06,760
Come.

1032
01:11:09,050 --> 01:11:11,780
- Mother... - Mother!
- Vijay!

1033
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:16,790
- Vijay babu has committed a terrible mistake.
- What mistake?

1034
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:21,060
He had sent his mother away
empty-handed, hadn't he?

1035
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:23,310
What are you saying, Jeet?

1036
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:25,730
It doesn't matter
what happens to us...

1037
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:29,050
but we can't bear to
see you unhappy, mother.

1038
01:11:31,130 --> 01:11:33,960
Come, let's go to Ratan babu.
Please come.

1039
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,910
Kiran, how long will you
torture me like this?

1040
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:44,890
Oh, give it here; I'll light
your cigarette for you.

1041
01:11:45,620 --> 01:11:47,470
You delight in setting
my heart alight.

1042
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:53,540
I'll only be at peace when the
wedding pipes play at our wedding.

1043
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:56,320
Why, have you forgotten
Jeet completely?

1044
01:11:56,490 --> 01:11:59,940
Jeet? And me? That was
only a joke.

1045
01:12:00,350 --> 01:12:01,750
To make you jealous.

1046
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:05,300
Actually, Jeet is
a strange girl.

1047
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:09,700
- That weird girl is here for you.
- For me?

1048
01:12:09,950 --> 01:12:13,310
- What do you mean?
- You couldn't be a man if you didn't marry me, right?

1049
01:12:13,770 --> 01:12:15,960
So, okay. Marry me and
become a man.

1050
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:19,300
I told you Vijay would never
brush my request aside.

1051
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:24,790
What are you thinking, brother?
Take the little that is mine, too.

1052
01:12:25,190 --> 01:12:28,630
Nonsense! Mother, Jeet and I don't
have anything in common.

1053
01:12:28,910 --> 01:12:31,600
- She's an old-fashioned, traditional Indian girl.
- Brother!

1054
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:36,180
- I don't want this marriage.
- Shameless wretch! Why weren't you still-born?

1055
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:38,570
Why did you live to disgrace me?

1056
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:42,560
Aren't you ashamed to have
played with our feelings?

1057
01:12:42,850 --> 01:12:47,700
Mother, I knew that Ratan babu and
my uncle wouldn't leave me alone.

1058
01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:52,660
That's why I bestowed my wealth
and property on Kiran.

1059
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:56,440
Don't worry about
Ratan babu, Mother.

1060
01:12:57,540 --> 01:13:01,330
He will get his heart's
desire from Kiran.

1061
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:04,380
Please come.

1062
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:20,900
- Ratan babu...
- Kiran, please leave me alone now.

1063
01:13:21,290 --> 01:13:24,410
Ratan babu... I can't
leave you alone now.

1064
01:13:24,740 --> 01:13:28,770
I'm burning in humiliation.
I don't feel good at all.

1065
01:13:29,260 --> 01:13:31,710
Ratan babu, I've also
been insulted.

1066
01:13:32,390 --> 01:13:34,340
You be the flame,
I'll be as the storm...

1067
01:13:34,770 --> 01:13:38,050
- Between us, we will destroy Vijay's and Jeet's dreams.
- Kiran!

1068
01:14:06,410 --> 01:14:11,170
The carefree winds and
mischievous streams

1069
01:14:14,690 --> 01:14:17,750
Let my heart not be swayed

1070
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:29,160
How lovely is the evening today

1071
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:35,776
Let my heart not be swayed

1072
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:39,260
by careless winds and
mischievous streams

1073
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:49,790
My heart is filled with
tumultuous desires

1074
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:54,780
Like the waves of the sea

1075
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:06,170
Won't somone offer me safe harbor

1076
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:12,630
Lest my heart be swayed

1077
01:15:12,660 --> 01:15:16,410
By carefree winds
and mischievous streams

1078
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:33,350
Life doesn't move on
without a beloved

1079
01:15:33,460 --> 01:15:39,790
Nor does a journey pass
without a companion

1080
01:15:49,380 --> 01:15:54,210
I'm searching for a haven

1081
01:15:57,340 --> 01:16:00,376
Lest my heart be swayed

1082
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:03,840
By these carefree winds
and mischievous streams

1083
01:16:05,250 --> 01:16:11,510
How lovely is the evening today

1084
01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:17,926
Let my heart not be swayed

1085
01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:20,880
By these carefree winds
and mischievous streams

1086
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:24,110
Let my heart not be swayed

1087
01:16:24,190 --> 01:16:28,330
By these carefree winds
and mischievous streams

1088
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,680
Hello, mister...
cooking, I see.

1089
01:16:44,610 --> 01:16:46,610
It looks like the wood stove
isn't alight.

1090
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:48,690
What can I do if
the firewood is damp?

1091
01:16:49,070 --> 01:16:53,570
You can't do anything. What
can\nyou do other than lecture people?

1092
01:16:53,950 --> 01:16:56,820
So, madam, why don't you try
your hand at it? Please come.

1093
01:17:06,610 --> 01:17:09,690
See? You can't even
light a wood stove.

1094
01:17:10,030 --> 01:17:12,640
Oh, what great feat
did you accomplish?

1095
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:15,160
But you couldn't accomplish
this little task.

1096
01:17:15,510 --> 01:17:17,590
So how will you accomplish
great feats in the future?

1097
01:17:17,810 --> 01:17:21,070
I don't have to light a woodstove
in order to accomplish great feats.

1098
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:25,870
- This is a woman's job.
- Women are born to light stoves and grind flour.

1099
01:17:26,370 --> 01:17:28,170
Who else will say this?

1100
01:17:28,890 --> 01:17:31,160
What do you know of the
greatness of women?

1101
01:17:37,210 --> 01:17:39,430
What's this? You are upset?

1102
01:17:40,670 --> 01:17:42,970
If I don't understand the
greatness of women, who will?

1103
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:45,920
Jeet is a woman,
and so is my mother.

1104
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:48,680
Whatever Vijay has learned
has been from them.

1105
01:17:49,730 --> 01:17:52,820
Stop it. Don't praise me
to the skies.

1106
01:17:53,930 --> 01:17:57,600
- Anyway, tell me, what's cooking?
- Khichdi [Kedigree]

1107
01:17:58,390 --> 01:18:01,230
And it will continue to cook slowly.
Until then, let's go.

1108
01:18:01,570 --> 01:18:03,010
Let's 'cook' our dreams.

1109
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:21,140
Oh, Munimji... tell me,
when did you arrive?

1110
01:18:21,270 --> 01:18:23,940
- A short while ago.
- You didn't call us?

1111
01:18:25,710 --> 01:18:30,600
My friend, I thought the two of you
were dreaming lovely dreams...

1112
01:18:30,830 --> 01:18:32,900
why should I be the third wheel?

1113
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:36,280
Listen, tell me, how is mother?

1114
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:38,600
Until there's a rapproachment
between brothers...

1115
01:18:39,390 --> 01:18:41,940
how will mother
know peace, Vijay?

1116
01:18:42,310 --> 01:18:45,390
Tell mother not to worry.

1117
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:50,090
We are dreaming of peace
for the entire world.

1118
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:53,090
Yes, Munimji, we wish that
everyone in the world is content.

1119
01:18:53,780 --> 01:18:57,040
- That every village is prosperous.
- Huh? - Yes, Munimji.

1120
01:18:57,810 --> 01:19:00,390
Look at one facet
of our lovely dream...

1121
01:19:01,190 --> 01:19:04,200
Our dream village...
look here...

1122
01:19:04,810 --> 01:19:08,110
- Here's the big school...
- and here are the modern houses in place of huts.

1123
01:19:08,570 --> 01:19:10,830
- Here's the cattle sheds...
- and here's the town hall.

1124
01:19:11,130 --> 01:19:13,890
- Here's the dispensary...
- and that's the post office.

1125
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:17,920
- And all the roads will be paved.
- And... - Hey, hey, dear friends...

1126
01:19:18,270 --> 01:19:20,200
It's a very beautiful dream.

1127
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:23,400
But how will this beautiful
dream of paradise...

1128
01:19:23,770 --> 01:19:26,480
on earth be possible
without money?

1129
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:30,400
Where do the poor villagers
have money for this?

1130
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:33,190
Riches don't fall from the skies
on the wealthy either.

1131
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:35,930
Its the poor who plough gold
from the soil...

1132
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:39,230
and they also labor in factories
that print rupee notes.

1133
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:41,440
And the products that are bought
with that money...

1134
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:43,480
are also manufactured
by poor laborers.

1135
01:19:43,870 --> 01:19:47,560
When the poor can slave to create
a paradise for the rich in the cities...

1136
01:19:47,830 --> 01:19:50,270
can't they labor to create a
beautiful village for themselves?

1137
01:19:50,350 --> 01:19:53,860
- Absolutely correct!
- Yes. Everything is possible when we work together.

1138
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:56,030
Er... it's a wonderful idea.

1139
01:19:56,130 --> 01:19:59,620
Vijay, a fight has broken out between
our village and the neighboring one.

1140
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:00,990
- A fight?
- Yes.

1141
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:03,260
Come, let's go.

1142
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:16,100
What's the matter? Tell me
what the matter is!

1143
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:17,856
- Vijay babu!
- Why're you on the streets?

1144
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:21,040
- Don't interfere between us.
- Get lost from here.

1145
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:22,420
Settle this peacefully.

1146
01:20:25,390 --> 01:20:29,150
Kiran... what are you
doing here?

1147
01:20:29,610 --> 01:20:31,750
I'm watching the drama
of social welfare.

1148
01:20:32,470 --> 01:20:35,030
- And its main characters.
- You mean Vijay?

1149
01:20:35,420 --> 01:20:37,280
Nonsense! Forget Vijay.

1150
01:20:37,820 --> 01:20:40,210
- Now we have to begin our drama.
- Ratan babu...

1151
01:20:41,060 --> 01:20:43,400
whatever you say,
Vijay is Vijay.

1152
01:20:43,930 --> 01:20:46,140
Vijay is Vijay!
Nonsense!

1153
01:20:46,590 --> 01:20:48,290
He set out to reform
the villagers.

1154
01:20:49,590 --> 01:20:53,450
He rejects you? Now watch him
get beaten up by the villagers.

1155
01:20:53,780 --> 01:20:55,970
Please listen to us
before you fight.

1156
01:20:56,190 --> 01:20:58,150
We shouldn't settle our
differences with sticks...

1157
01:20:58,540 --> 01:21:00,780
but seek to resolve them
through mediation.

1158
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:03,120
You have to deal with it peacefully.

1159
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:06,400
We are brothers, and it's better
that we live with amity.

1160
01:21:07,210 --> 01:21:10,240
If brother fights brother,
how will a nation progress?

1161
01:21:10,450 --> 01:21:12,650
Vijay babu, you don't know
the reason for our enimity.

1162
01:21:12,740 --> 01:21:16,480
Friend, it doesn't matter. lnstead of
fighting each other, or going to court...

1163
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:19,330
our internal fights should be
resolved by the Panchayat.

1164
01:21:19,470 --> 01:21:23,316
- Vijay babu is right. - Yes, he is.
- Alright. - Now go back to work.

1165
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:24,520
- Go.
- Eh?

1166
01:21:25,940 --> 01:21:29,380
The villagers have cooled off?
What magic does Vijay have...

1167
01:21:30,250 --> 01:21:33,110
- that they all listen to him?
- That's why I said...

1168
01:21:34,070 --> 01:21:36,280
- that Vijay is Vijay.
- Nonsense!

1169
01:21:36,990 --> 01:21:38,190
Let's go.

1170
01:21:40,580 --> 01:21:41,780
Come on.

1171
01:21:44,610 --> 01:21:46,480
- Papa!
- Namaste, uncle.

1172
01:21:56,610 --> 01:22:00,980
- Oh, you've come?
- Why, papa, do you think I don't want to come home?

1173
01:22:01,150 --> 01:22:03,190
What else? Today's girls...

1174
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:05,720
don't keep their feet on the ground,
let alone inside the home.

1175
01:22:05,770 --> 01:22:09,000
You're exactly like Jeet,
both of you soaring free.

1176
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:13,130
Nonsense! That's unimportant. Do you
have any idea what's happening here?

1177
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:15,686
What's happened in the villager?
Has there been an outbreak of plague?

1178
01:22:15,710 --> 01:22:18,440
Is our hut-dwelling brother any less
a scourge than plague?

1179
01:22:18,770 --> 01:22:21,450
Ah, now you make sense.
But Ratan babu...

1180
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:24,560
he's lost all right to
your wealth and property.

1181
01:22:24,700 --> 01:22:27,180
- And Jeet has nothing either.
- Nonsense!

1182
01:22:27,430 --> 01:22:30,950
That's what you don't understand.
This social service is just a front...

1183
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:33,640
to incite the workers
and farmers against us.

1184
01:22:34,110 --> 01:22:35,530
If the villagers unite...

1185
01:22:35,780 --> 01:22:37,900
then our fiefdoms,
these shops...

1186
01:22:38,210 --> 01:22:40,670
money-lending, etc.,
will not last for a minute.

1187
01:22:41,060 --> 01:22:43,030
Ah... you speak much sense.

1188
01:22:48,050 --> 01:22:52,930
So this hut-dweller is striking at
the foundations of the wealthy.

1189
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:57,470
It's natural, papa. He'll destroy
what he can't have.

1190
01:22:58,010 --> 01:23:02,630
Vijay babu will evict us from these
mansions and settle us in some hut.

1191
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:05,030
He has Jeet to help him.

1192
01:23:05,790 --> 01:23:07,460
I'd thought...

1193
01:23:07,890 --> 01:23:11,140
that Jeet had renounced
all her wealth and property.

1194
01:23:11,510 --> 01:23:14,000
Now, even if she marries Vijay,
how will that affect us?

1195
01:23:14,230 --> 01:23:15,630
That's absolutely wrong.

1196
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:18,140
Papa... Jeet's and Vijay's wedding...

1197
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:20,400
will be our biggest defeat.

1198
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:25,740
Ah, you've put your finger on it.
I have to take care of Jeet.

1199
01:23:26,220 --> 01:23:29,870
- And I'll bring my hut-dweller brother to his senses.
- Marvellous!

1200
01:23:33,690 --> 01:23:36,710
Madam... Ratan babu has
gone\ntowards Vijay's hut.

1201
01:23:36,990 --> 01:23:39,390
I don't know what he's going to do.
Please come quickly.

1202
01:23:39,580 --> 01:23:42,640
Ratan has gone to Vijay's?
Come, Munimji.

1203
01:23:50,530 --> 01:23:53,140
And we'll change our nation,
village by village.

1204
01:23:54,230 --> 01:23:55,830
All you village chiefs
gathered here...

1205
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:58,310
I want each of you to
decide that, from today...

1206
01:23:58,790 --> 01:24:00,810
you will work for the progress
of your own village.

1207
01:24:01,310 --> 01:24:03,520
What's the use of our efforts,
Vijay babu?

1208
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,770
This is the government's job.

1209
01:24:06,060 --> 01:24:07,860
If the government works,
something can change.

1210
01:24:08,110 --> 01:24:12,290
No, Patelji. We shouldn't look to
the government for everything.

1211
01:24:12,830 --> 01:24:16,910
This is a bad habit. We've looked to
the government for 150 years...

1212
01:24:17,230 --> 01:24:21,390
that's why we became so poor. Now,
we've to stand on our own feet.

1213
01:24:21,810 --> 01:24:24,200
And... now the government
is also ours.

1214
01:24:24,370 --> 01:24:26,830
We just have to learn
to work together...

1215
01:24:27,180 --> 01:24:29,680
and firstly, we have to ensure that
our villages are clean.

1216
01:24:29,780 --> 01:24:31,980
The root of this filth
is poverty, Vijay babu.

1217
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:34,960
Can we get rid of poverty
by ourselves?

1218
01:24:35,290 --> 01:24:38,280
No, Choudhuryji. The root
of this filth is laziness.

1219
01:24:38,630 --> 01:24:41,980
If we refuse to be lazy, and
keep our houses and village clean...

1220
01:24:42,250 --> 01:24:43,870
what can poverty do?

1221
01:24:44,260 --> 01:24:46,140
This poverty is also
of our own making.

1222
01:24:47,150 --> 01:24:50,060
If we all work together, our fields
will produce a rich harvest.

1223
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:52,730
United, the sky's our limit.

1224
01:24:52,870 --> 01:24:55,430
The farmers have to believe
they belong to one family.

1225
01:24:55,810 --> 01:24:57,880
Combine all the fields into one.

1226
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:00,090
Then, work together to
plow and seed it.

1227
01:25:00,430 --> 01:25:03,150
Then, divide the yield
amongst everyone.

1228
01:25:03,650 --> 01:25:06,730
The yield will also increase,
and you folk...

1229
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:09,480
will be free of clutches of the
zamindars and moneylenders.

1230
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:11,440
Yes, that is right, chief.

1231
01:25:12,090 --> 01:25:14,330
But we need someone
to show us the way.

1232
01:25:14,660 --> 01:25:16,180
We offer our services.

1233
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:18,920
Come, let's begin work
on the fields tomorrow.

1234
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:21,430
On whose land? Is it
your father's property?

1235
01:25:23,250 --> 01:25:26,970
- Brother...
- Shut up, you wretch! You dare call yourself my brother?

1236
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:30,620
First, tell me why you built a hut
on my land without my permission.

1237
01:25:31,130 --> 01:25:32,630
It's a matter of foreclosure.

1238
01:25:32,810 --> 01:25:35,290
But instead of handing it over to
the police, I've come myself.

1239
01:25:35,730 --> 01:25:38,970
And I've granted this stay because
you grew up on my father's charity.

1240
01:25:39,380 --> 01:25:42,550
Ratan babu... don't speak
that way to Vijay babu.

1241
01:25:43,030 --> 01:25:45,420
- He speaks for our benefit.
- Nonsense.

1242
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:48,120
He's simply inciting the farmers
against the landowners.

1243
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:50,250
He wants to destroy
the moneylenders.

1244
01:25:50,830 --> 01:25:53,190
I won't allow such a dangerous man
to remain in the village.

1245
01:25:53,290 --> 01:25:56,150
- Clear out from this hut.
- Who are you to evict him?

1246
01:25:56,660 --> 01:25:58,740
Your mother is still alive.
Vijay will remain here.

1247
01:25:58,810 --> 01:26:01,610
Vijay will not remain here.
This land and property is mine.

1248
01:26:02,110 --> 01:26:04,560
- You have no right to interfere.
- Right?

1249
01:26:04,900 --> 01:26:08,360
- I'm your mother.
- But you're not being fair, Madam.

1250
01:26:08,870 --> 01:26:11,070
The land rightfully belongs
to Ratan babu.

1251
01:26:11,510 --> 01:26:15,650
Sure, but a mother has complete
rights over her son. Understand?

1252
01:26:16,610 --> 01:26:21,440
If this becomes a police case, you
won't like what happens, Munimji.

1253
01:26:21,870 --> 01:26:23,990
So the police will intervene
between a mother and son?

1254
01:26:24,380 --> 01:26:26,720
The police will help
the enemies of the nation?

1255
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:30,570
The blood of the Kshatriyas
[a fighting clan] runs in my veins.

1256
01:26:31,230 --> 01:26:32,730
Apologise to Vijay. At once.

1257
01:26:32,790 --> 01:26:34,746
- I won't apologise to that wretch.
- Wretch? - Mother...

1258
01:26:34,770 --> 01:26:37,780
- what are you doing?
- I'll beat him to death today.

1259
01:26:38,090 --> 01:26:39,490
I'll show the world...

1260
01:26:39,700 --> 01:26:42,110
that a mother can kill her son
for the sake of the country.

1261
01:26:42,540 --> 01:26:44,400
I've nursed a snake in my bosom.

1262
01:26:44,740 --> 01:26:46,490
Today, I'll defang him.

1263
01:26:46,550 --> 01:26:48,590
Forget it, mother.
I'll leave the hut too.

1264
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:51,350
Do you want me to
beat you as well?

1265
01:26:52,170 --> 01:26:55,930
I don't know the law. All I know
is that I'm a mother.

1266
01:26:56,350 --> 01:26:58,270
And both my sons
had better obey me.

1267
01:27:06,570 --> 01:27:10,080
Listen to me, my Krishna

1268
01:27:14,030 --> 01:27:17,470
The world...

1269
01:27:17,770 --> 01:27:21,190
Your world is full of suffering

1270
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:24,910
Listen to me, my Krishna

1271
01:27:25,290 --> 01:27:27,350
Please listen...

1272
01:27:34,130 --> 01:27:38,330
Some people revel
in their mansions

1273
01:27:38,550 --> 01:27:42,140
While others have to stumble
from door to door

1274
01:27:51,940 --> 01:27:57,340
One laughs, while
the other weeps...

1275
01:28:00,490 --> 01:28:05,150
in this world.
How can you bear it?

1276
01:28:13,140 --> 01:28:16,570
What injustice is this,
O Krishna?

1277
01:28:20,870 --> 01:28:24,400
Your world is full of suffering

1278
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:28,110
Listen to me, my Krishna

1279
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:30,320
Please listen...

1280
01:28:32,370 --> 01:28:36,030
This land yields gold

1281
01:28:36,330 --> 01:28:39,970
While nectar rains from the skies

1282
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:51,740
Yet, in your world, how many

1283
01:28:52,070 --> 01:28:55,590
Yearn for a piece of bread

1284
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:09,240
Thousands go hungry

1285
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:13,040
Listen to me, my Krishna

1286
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:20,840
Your world is full of suffering

1287
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:24,660
Listen to me, my Krishna

1288
01:29:24,940 --> 01:29:26,900
Please listen...

1289
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:36,390
Amidst the strife between
beliefs and religions

1290
01:29:36,690 --> 01:29:40,320
Your world is being destroyed

1291
01:29:48,390 --> 01:29:52,180
In the name of riches
and wealth, a brother

1292
01:29:52,210 --> 01:29:56,470
is willing to spill
a brother's blood

1293
01:30:06,130 --> 01:30:09,750
Awaken us, show us the way

1294
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:17,540
Please protect my honor

1295
01:30:18,020 --> 01:30:21,570
Listen to me, my Krishna

1296
01:30:25,910 --> 01:30:29,580
Your world is full of suffering

1297
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:33,470
Listen to me, my Krishna

1298
01:30:33,770 --> 01:30:36,280
Listen... please listen...

1299
01:30:47,230 --> 01:30:50,650
- Tell me, sir, all packed and ready?
- Yes.

1300
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:53,500
You're very eager to
go to the city?

1301
01:30:54,470 --> 01:30:56,590
And if I don't let you go?

1302
01:30:56,810 --> 01:30:58,520
Then, madam, forget about
social service.

1303
01:30:58,970 --> 01:31:01,750
If I don't go, who'll bring
the press for our newspaper?

1304
01:31:02,290 --> 01:31:06,050
You're going to the city. Are you
taking your brains with you?

1305
01:31:06,660 --> 01:31:10,170
Look, it's the city. Even the best
can lose their minds.

1306
01:31:10,710 --> 01:31:12,790
Be careful where you step.

1307
01:31:13,090 --> 01:31:14,646
You could slip anytime.

1308
01:31:14,670 --> 01:31:16,670
Of course. As if I haven't
seen the city before.

1309
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:19,460
I grew to be tall and
strapping in the city.

1310
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,996
I simply warned you. You may take it
or leave it as you please.

1311
01:31:23,020 --> 01:31:24,770
Don't worry. I'll be back soon.

1312
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:27,210
Until then, take care
of the villagers. Yes?

1313
01:31:28,710 --> 01:31:29,810
Alright.

1314
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:39,240
This has become necessary...

1315
01:31:39,580 --> 01:31:42,590
but the matter has to be
completed from our side.

1316
01:31:43,140 --> 01:31:45,200
- Then no one can harm us.
- Papa...

1317
01:31:45,310 --> 01:31:47,340
this is a case of insiders
causing the most damage.

1318
01:31:48,110 --> 01:31:50,630
Here, your niece, Jeet,
is causing enough drama...

1319
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:54,600
and there, Ratan babu's mother has
turned into the Goddess of Destruction.

1320
01:31:54,670 --> 01:31:57,440
Nonsense! That day, I forgave her
because she's my mother...

1321
01:31:58,020 --> 01:32:00,460
but I'm not one to quietly
accept my humiliation.

1322
01:32:00,530 --> 01:32:03,350
What can I say? You're unique.

1323
01:32:04,170 --> 01:32:06,120
Jeet! Come here.
Come here!

1324
01:32:08,450 --> 01:32:09,970
You can't go anywhere now.

1325
01:32:10,890 --> 01:32:13,700
So you are not satisfied
with my wealth and property?

1326
01:32:14,060 --> 01:32:16,380
Property, my foot!
Go inside!

1327
01:32:17,130 --> 01:32:18,810
You're bent upon disgracing
your ancestors.

1328
01:32:19,110 --> 01:32:21,410
You may well consider that
I don't belong to this family.

1329
01:32:21,710 --> 01:32:24,630
So I'll consider that upon your say so,
and the world will accept it?

1330
01:32:24,930 --> 01:32:28,020
You've become shameless,
and I've to protect our clan's honor.

1331
01:32:28,420 --> 01:32:30,590
I order you not to
step out of the house.

1332
01:32:30,910 --> 01:32:33,830
I'm sorry I cannot obey you.

1333
01:32:33,910 --> 01:32:36,340
Can't obey? I order you
to go inside.

1334
01:32:36,630 --> 01:32:38,340
- I won't go.
- You won't?

1335
01:32:38,870 --> 01:32:41,366
- Won't go? When I keep you
under lock and key...

1336
01:32:41,390 --> 01:32:43,190
- then you will come to your senses.
- Uncle!

1337
01:32:43,510 --> 01:32:45,420
I say, go inside!

1338
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:54,050
Well, now we're free.
Jeet has been caged.

1339
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:55,700
I'll take care of Vijay.

1340
01:32:55,810 --> 01:32:58,980
I heard Vijay babu was going to the city
to buy a press for his newspaper.

1341
01:32:59,060 --> 01:33:00,760
I've already made
arrangements for him.

1342
01:33:01,300 --> 01:33:04,020
- On the way itself, he'll be...
- That's the height of wretchedness.

1343
01:33:07,570 --> 01:33:10,100
- Hooligan!
- Who're you calling names?

1344
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:14,710
I have the strength
to give you a hiding...

1345
01:33:15,580 --> 01:33:17,130
but to reform you...

1346
01:33:17,510 --> 01:33:19,220
I don't wish to use a stick.

1347
01:33:19,650 --> 01:33:21,250
I wish to win him over.

1348
01:33:45,810 --> 01:33:48,880
Hello, doctor. What's the
patient's condition? How's he?

1349
01:33:49,460 --> 01:33:51,470
He's alright now.
You don't worry.

1350
01:33:52,340 --> 01:33:55,310
He was lucky to escape, poor guy.
If I hadn't gone to survey the village...

1351
01:33:55,540 --> 01:33:58,630
those hooligans would have killed him.
I'm glad I brought him to the city...

1352
01:33:58,890 --> 01:34:00,390
where he could be treated.

1353
01:34:11,340 --> 01:34:14,770
Where am I?
Jeet...

1354
01:34:23,180 --> 01:34:24,380
Where's Jeet?

1355
01:34:42,620 --> 01:34:47,670
A few desires had bloomed

1356
01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:55,080
Yet I couldn't even smile
to my heart's content

1357
01:35:07,930 --> 01:35:12,800
Even though my heart has
cried itself to death

1358
01:35:18,360 --> 01:35:25,330
Yet not one tear escaped my eyes

1359
01:35:25,590 --> 01:35:30,880
A few desires had bloomed

1360
01:35:35,790 --> 01:35:40,750
When did these ties break?

1361
01:35:40,870 --> 01:35:45,720
When will these
chains of sorrow break?

1362
01:36:00,890 --> 01:36:05,820
Look at Fate's helplessness

1363
01:36:11,290 --> 01:36:18,400
He could not come to me
nor I go to him

1364
01:36:29,390 --> 01:36:36,020
Oh, the garden of my hopes
bloomed and withered

1365
01:36:36,360 --> 01:36:40,890
Our hearts united
only to be separated

1366
01:36:51,060 --> 01:36:55,820
He lost me after
he had made me his

1367
01:37:01,270 --> 01:37:08,030
And I having lost him, could
never hope to get him back

1368
01:37:08,230 --> 01:37:13,060
A few desires had bloomed

1369
01:37:13,230 --> 01:37:20,440
Yet I could not even smile
to my heart's content

1370
01:37:20,650 --> 01:37:26,530
A few desires had bloomed...

1371
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:39,420
Despite having him,
I've still lost him...

1372
01:37:40,390 --> 01:37:42,640
He lost, but
could never have me.

1373
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,500
Who couldn't have you, Kiran?
You're mine now.

1374
01:37:47,020 --> 01:37:48,940
My hopes had bloomed a little...

1375
01:37:49,930 --> 01:37:51,820
yet I couldn't smile
to my heart's content.

1376
01:37:52,050 --> 01:37:54,650
Hey, why are you talking
such nonsense today?

1377
01:37:55,010 --> 01:37:57,290
Our hopes and dreams
are just going to bloom.

1378
01:37:58,240 --> 01:38:00,920
I've decided that
after the wedding...

1379
01:38:01,030 --> 01:38:04,150
we'll go to America. All our dreams
will be realised there.

1380
01:38:05,010 --> 01:38:08,360
Er... I've heard that it's very
expensive to go to America?

1381
01:38:08,390 --> 01:38:10,850
Nonsense! Do we
lack the finances?

1382
01:38:11,300 --> 01:38:13,230
And now, Jeet's wealth
is also yours.

1383
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:15,860
- When will that come in useful, after all?
- Oh...

1384
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:18,270
So this is the day
you were waiting for?

1385
01:38:18,950 --> 01:38:21,810
Ratan babu, you love money.

1386
01:38:22,370 --> 01:38:25,310
- And now, I hate it.
- Kiran!

1387
01:38:27,320 --> 01:38:29,680
What are you saying?
What's come over you today?

1388
01:38:30,060 --> 01:38:33,430
I'm speaking the truth. I disgraced
myself for this wealth.

1389
01:38:33,810 --> 01:38:36,940
You destroyed Jeet's and Vijay's
dreams for this wealth.

1390
01:38:37,430 --> 01:38:40,540
You saddened your mother. When
this wealth was with Jeet...

1391
01:38:41,020 --> 01:38:42,850
you were busy wooing her.

1392
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:46,980
When this wealth became mine,
you switched your attentions to me.

1393
01:38:47,430 --> 01:38:51,730
I hate you, your values, and
your false protestations of love.

1394
01:38:52,330 --> 01:38:54,660
Kiran, don't prevent me
from reaching my goal.

1395
01:38:55,180 --> 01:38:57,170
I know how to crush
the obstacles on my path.

1396
01:38:57,660 --> 01:39:00,860
And I can destroy your
hopes and dreams. Get lost!

1397
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:05,650
That's fine, then.
I'll see to you later.

1398
01:39:11,130 --> 01:39:12,230
Munimji...

1399
01:39:14,490 --> 01:39:17,140
- ls there any news of Jeet?
- No, madam.

1400
01:39:17,850 --> 01:39:19,470
God knows what's
going to happen.

1401
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:22,070
And Vijay hasn't returned
from the city either.

1402
01:39:22,590 --> 01:39:26,860
Madam, people assume Jeet has gone
to the city to search for Vijay.

1403
01:39:27,410 --> 01:39:30,380
Madam... madam...
Madam!

1404
01:39:31,050 --> 01:39:32,460
There's news of Miss Jeet.

1405
01:39:32,910 --> 01:39:35,410
Thakur Kalyan Singh has her
locked up in his house.

1406
01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:37,850
We heard about it just now
from his daughter.

1407
01:39:38,150 --> 01:39:40,620
Munimji, we have to
free Jeet right away.

1408
01:39:41,430 --> 01:39:43,420
Thakur Kalyan Singh cannot
keep her prisoner.

1409
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:49,420
Thakuraniji, please listen to me.
Jeet is not at home.

1410
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:52,380
In fact, I'm quite worried as to
where she's gone.

1411
01:39:53,160 --> 01:39:55,720
There's nothing to
worry about, Mother.

1412
01:39:56,170 --> 01:39:58,160
Papa's memory is
beginning to fail...

1413
01:39:58,460 --> 01:40:01,380
and he's forgotten that he's shut
Jeet in a room upstairs...

1414
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:04,200
- and locked it from the outside.
- What are you yammering about?

1415
01:40:04,610 --> 01:40:06,970
- You've sprouted wings too, have you?
- That's right, papa.

1416
01:40:07,190 --> 01:40:10,400
When one sprouts wings, they
soar freely in the skies.

1417
01:40:10,900 --> 01:40:14,560
- Come, mother, we have to free Jeet.
- Thakuraniji...

1418
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:16,790
please don't meddle in
our family matters.

1419
01:40:17,030 --> 01:40:19,490
I may behave anyway I wish
with my niece...

1420
01:40:19,640 --> 01:40:21,300
I have the legal right.

1421
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:23,640
Thakur saab, please don't
teach me the law.

1422
01:40:23,790 --> 01:40:26,550
By imprisoning Jeet,
you've broken the law.

1423
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:30,060
Er... Thakuraniji, I've
done nothing illegal.

1424
01:40:30,330 --> 01:40:32,290
You're breaking the law
by entering my house.

1425
01:40:32,870 --> 01:40:34,890
Papa, you forget so quickly...

1426
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:38,320
This house belongs to Jeet,
and she bestowed it upon me.

1427
01:40:38,590 --> 01:40:40,320
- Now I'm entitled to this.
- Eh?

1428
01:40:40,630 --> 01:40:43,070
Please come, mother. All of you,
come on and break the lock.

1429
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:52,010
Thakur saheb, let me remind you,
this is the 20th century. Understood?

1430
01:41:01,080 --> 01:41:03,650
Come, my dear.
Come out of this jail.

1431
01:41:04,070 --> 01:41:07,980
- Who has the power to imprison you?
- Say victory to Miss Jeet!

1432
01:41:08,890 --> 01:41:11,010
- Kiran! You!
- Yes...

1433
01:41:11,230 --> 01:41:13,950
- I'm not playing a part.
- Yes, Jeet...

1434
01:41:15,910 --> 01:41:17,540
It was Kiran who
brought me here.

1435
01:41:19,130 --> 01:41:20,330
- Kiran!
- Jeet!

1436
01:41:22,530 --> 01:41:24,310
The way these sisters
have reconciled...

1437
01:41:25,310 --> 01:41:27,000
if only the brothers
would reconcile too...

1438
01:41:28,250 --> 01:41:30,400
I'll consider it
a mother's victory.

1439
01:41:33,470 --> 01:41:36,200
We - will - all - work.

1440
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:38,880
We will all work.

1441
01:41:39,180 --> 01:41:41,680
We will make a name
for ourselves in the world.

1442
01:41:41,740 --> 01:41:44,050
We will make a name
for ourselves in the world.

1443
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:47,200
Jeet... is there
any news of Vijay?

1444
01:41:49,300 --> 01:41:53,810
No, mother. I don't know
what's taking him so long.

1445
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:58,250
Don't worry, my dear.
Vijay will definitely come.

1446
01:41:59,630 --> 01:42:01,850
I don't feel like
working alone, mother.

1447
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:04,190
I've come to support you.

1448
01:42:05,330 --> 01:42:07,570
Now I'll stay here and
help you with your work.

1449
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:10,650
And I'll see who stops us.

1450
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:14,440
- Let me go, Nurse.
- No, please don't get up.

1451
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:17,160
I've a lot of work to do.
It's important that I leave.

1452
01:42:17,240 --> 01:42:19,696
No, no... you need
complete rest.

1453
01:42:19,720 --> 01:42:21,620
- These are the doctor's orders.
- Order!

1454
01:42:23,510 --> 01:42:25,470
How will you understand
the ache of my heart?

1455
01:42:26,340 --> 01:42:34,170
How will you understand
the ache of my heart?

1456
01:42:34,540 --> 01:42:41,700
What do you know about
fulfilling love's promises?

1457
01:42:42,780 --> 01:42:48,110
You have learned
how to stoke the flames

1458
01:42:48,550 --> 01:42:54,470
What do you know about
dousing the flames?

1459
01:43:01,910 --> 01:43:09,780
You wish that I weep

1460
01:43:10,100 --> 01:43:17,520
Weep so much that I lose my life

1461
01:43:34,380 --> 01:43:39,600
You have learned how
to make others weep

1462
01:43:39,890 --> 01:43:45,910
What do you know about
shedding tears?

1463
01:43:50,670 --> 01:43:55,840
Please don't trouble me any more

1464
01:43:56,170 --> 01:44:01,430
Look, I have lost and you've won

1465
01:44:06,860 --> 01:44:12,020
You have learned how to
torment my heart

1466
01:44:12,210 --> 01:44:17,860
What do you know about
easing its ache?

1467
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:33,170
The path on which we were
to walk together

1468
01:44:33,490 --> 01:44:40,690
Live together...
die together...

1469
01:44:57,330 --> 01:45:02,290
You deserted me on that path

1470
01:45:02,550 --> 01:45:09,250
What do you know about
staying together forever?

1471
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:30,160
Do your work, everyone,
do your work.

1472
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:33,000
Do your work, everyone
do your work.

1473
01:45:33,430 --> 01:45:36,800
You should make a name
for yourself in this world.

1474
01:45:37,060 --> 01:45:39,770
You should make a name
for yourself in this world.

1475
01:45:40,020 --> 01:45:43,560
No one shall remain unemployed...

1476
01:45:43,650 --> 01:45:46,330
No one shall remain unemployed.

1477
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:51,440
- No one shall remain helpless...
- Vijay babu has come! Vijay babu has come!

1478
01:45:51,960 --> 01:45:55,170
- Vijay! - Vijay!
- Jeet? - Vijay!

1479
01:45:55,970 --> 01:45:59,890
- Where were you? - I... just...
- I told you not to go to the city alone.

1480
01:45:59,990 --> 01:46:02,020
- Namaste, Vijay babu.
- Oh, Kiran is here too?

1481
01:46:02,280 --> 01:46:05,200
- I've admitted defeat.
- And in that lies your victory.

1482
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:07,470
No, Jeet [Victory] is
really yours.

1483
01:46:07,740 --> 01:46:10,900
- That's true.
- Will you just stand out here, or will you come inside?

1484
01:46:11,120 --> 01:46:14,970
- Alright, kids, it's a holiday. Go.
- Holiday! - Holiday! - Come on.

1485
01:46:19,440 --> 01:46:22,610
Er... Thakuraniji, whatever
happened to Vijay...

1486
01:46:22,860 --> 01:46:25,750
was planned by Thakur Kalyan Singh
and Ratan babu.

1487
01:46:26,420 --> 01:46:29,620
Give us leave to bring them
to their senses.

1488
01:46:30,050 --> 01:46:32,800
Friends, no matter who was
responsible for this...

1489
01:46:33,210 --> 01:46:34,610
we shouldn't take revenge.

1490
01:46:35,400 --> 01:46:37,560
We have to win over even
our enemies with love.

1491
01:46:37,820 --> 01:46:41,200
But Vijay, people like them
understand actions, not words.

1492
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:43,560
You forget, Munimji...

1493
01:46:44,890 --> 01:46:47,740
our country achieved freedom
through peace and love.

1494
01:46:48,250 --> 01:46:50,780
So can't a few wayward minds
be reformed?

1495
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:53,340
Besides, our time is valuable.

1496
01:46:54,230 --> 01:46:56,390
Instead of wasting it on
squabbles amongst ourselves...

1497
01:46:56,610 --> 01:46:58,640
we should be spending it
on work that benefits us.

1498
01:46:58,990 --> 01:47:00,450
Vijay babu is right.

1499
01:47:01,450 --> 01:47:04,140
If we put our hearts and
minds into our work...

1500
01:47:04,620 --> 01:47:06,500
then our village will tranform.

1501
01:47:06,670 --> 01:47:08,500
Now we will all work together.

1502
01:47:09,550 --> 01:47:12,800
Anyone who does not work hard
will be evicted from the village.

1503
01:47:13,620 --> 01:47:16,720
- Now, our duty is to work.
- Yes.

1504
01:47:18,020 --> 01:47:21,540
God helps those
who help themselves.

1505
01:47:21,890 --> 01:47:23,680
Today, we are poor...

1506
01:47:24,750 --> 01:47:26,450
but wealth is created
through hard work.

1507
01:47:27,750 --> 01:47:29,440
Together, we will work hard.

1508
01:47:30,930 --> 01:47:32,710
Every bit of effort counts.

1509
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:38,210
Come, let's vow that, through our work,
we will set an example for the nation.

1510
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:41,160
Then watch how
it brings us fame.

1511
01:47:46,440 --> 01:47:50,830
Work, my friends, work,
Make a mark in this world

1512
01:48:05,180 --> 01:48:09,580
Come, let's transform our lives,
the world it's a-changing

1513
01:48:14,590 --> 01:48:18,880
No one should remain useless,
nor should they be helpless

1514
01:48:24,040 --> 01:48:28,400
Work, my friends, work
Make your mark in this world

1515
01:48:39,440 --> 01:48:43,700
Work is our strength, comrades
Work is our devotion

1516
01:48:48,920 --> 01:48:53,100
Work can help turn
our fortunes around

1517
01:48:58,330 --> 01:49:02,620
Work, my friends, work
Make your mark in this world

1518
01:49:17,070 --> 01:49:21,540
Rid yourself of old customs.
Leave behind old ties

1519
01:49:26,540 --> 01:49:30,830
Forge a bond with these new times,
this fresh, new world

1520
01:49:36,030 --> 01:49:40,470
Work, my friends, work.
Make a mark in this world

1521
01:49:51,470 --> 01:49:55,850
Let us unite,
forget our differences

1522
01:50:01,020 --> 01:50:05,290
Let's spread the word.
No one is a stranger

1523
01:50:10,610 --> 01:50:15,080
Work, my friends, work.
Make your mark on this world

1524
01:50:41,700 --> 01:50:44,540
'Work, work, work!'
Nonsense!

1525
01:50:47,300 --> 01:50:52,130
It's intolerable. The 'Do your work'
committee is spreading like wildfire.

1526
01:50:52,460 --> 01:50:55,940
And your daughter, Kiran? She, too,
has embraced the flames.

1527
01:50:56,180 --> 01:50:59,510
- Now you have to resolve this.
- My friend, that's the problem.

1528
01:51:00,090 --> 01:51:03,470
I suggest we find
a solution quickly.

1529
01:51:04,140 --> 01:51:06,450
Unfortunately, one of our
volleys misfired...

1530
01:51:06,780 --> 01:51:09,480
- and Vijay escaped.
- What's strange is that...

1531
01:51:09,570 --> 01:51:11,180
this year, during
the sowing period...

1532
01:51:11,270 --> 01:51:13,950
not one farmer came to me
to borrow money.

1533
01:51:14,850 --> 01:51:16,640
We're in trouble, Thakur saheb.

1534
01:51:16,740 --> 01:51:18,640
This is Jeet's and
Vijay's doing.

1535
01:51:18,990 --> 01:51:21,650
They have a unique vision;
they will unite everyone.

1536
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:25,016
They will destroy class distinctions
and make everyone equal.

1537
01:51:25,040 --> 01:51:26,640
What do we do, Thakur saheb?

1538
01:51:26,820 --> 01:51:28,786
That's what we need
to decide, my friend...

1539
01:51:28,810 --> 01:51:30,610
How will we find
a solution to this?

1540
01:51:30,970 --> 01:51:33,300
We cannot resolve this by force.

1541
01:51:33,720 --> 01:51:35,660
We have to visit every house
in the village...

1542
01:51:35,970 --> 01:51:37,690
and convince them that...

1543
01:51:37,730 --> 01:51:39,580
- we wish for their welfare.
- How?

1544
01:51:39,720 --> 01:51:41,820
With money. We have money.

1545
01:51:42,150 --> 01:51:43,900
We will buy machines
with that money.

1546
01:51:44,300 --> 01:51:47,040
And we will tell them that
for a nominal rent...

1547
01:51:47,300 --> 01:51:49,830
they can hire the machines which,
without any difficulty...

1548
01:51:50,060 --> 01:51:51,710
will plow their fields
in minutes.

1549
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:55,530
Their yield will be ten-fold and
they will be swimming in riches.

1550
01:51:56,030 --> 01:51:57,530
And to convince them...

1551
01:51:57,760 --> 01:51:59,530
we need to find a
helpful argument.

1552
01:51:59,700 --> 01:52:02,610
You said it! Ratan babu...

1553
01:52:02,980 --> 01:52:05,210
I used to think I was
quite unique.

1554
01:52:05,770 --> 01:52:08,540
But your brain also works
when necessity strikes.

1555
01:52:09,060 --> 01:52:11,510
Hey, tonight we celebrate
the Spring festival.

1556
01:52:11,650 --> 01:52:14,890
- It's a great opportunity.
- Let's get a stage dancer...

1557
01:52:15,120 --> 01:52:16,650
and invite the villagers.

1558
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:19,760
- Invite the poor people too.
- You said it!

1559
01:52:24,070 --> 01:52:26,420
What's up, sir?
What are you thinking of?

1560
01:52:27,620 --> 01:52:31,150
I was thinking that it's been over
two years since we got our freedom...

1561
01:52:32,140 --> 01:52:35,990
but our people are still suffering,
still dying of hunger.

1562
01:52:36,920 --> 01:52:40,280
My dear sir, thoughts won't help
people become prosperous.

1563
01:52:40,780 --> 01:52:42,410
I don't know what to do.

1564
01:52:43,490 --> 01:52:45,070
We've explained
to the villagers...

1565
01:52:45,990 --> 01:52:48,260
but despair still
clouds their minds.

1566
01:52:49,750 --> 01:52:52,260
These people cannot progress
without the government's help.

1567
01:52:53,400 --> 01:52:54,880
It's the government's fault.

1568
01:52:55,420 --> 01:52:57,526
If it's the government's fault,
then sitting around...

1569
01:52:57,550 --> 01:52:59,530
won't help us get the government
back on track.

1570
01:52:59,660 --> 01:53:02,280
First, we have to fulfil
our responsibilities.

1571
01:53:02,930 --> 01:53:05,980
And then, if the government doesn't
help us, we'll change the government.

1572
01:53:06,370 --> 01:53:07,970
Because, now, the
government is ours.

1573
01:53:08,200 --> 01:53:09,820
It exists due to our votes.

1574
01:53:10,580 --> 01:53:12,260
To abolish the
British government...

1575
01:53:12,630 --> 01:53:15,180
our nation's youth
sacrificed their own lives.

1576
01:53:15,710 --> 01:53:17,690
They climbed the gallows
with a smile.

1577
01:53:18,490 --> 01:53:20,560
And now that our country
has become free...

1578
01:53:20,790 --> 01:53:22,560
we can't find any young man...

1579
01:53:22,840 --> 01:53:25,270
who can travel to each village
to make them understand...

1580
01:53:25,700 --> 01:53:28,130
that we can only progress
if we stand united.

1581
01:53:28,740 --> 01:53:30,150
This is our fault.

1582
01:53:30,740 --> 01:53:32,140
We seem to think...

1583
01:53:32,350 --> 01:53:34,960
that our work is finished now
we've attained independence.

1584
01:53:35,650 --> 01:53:37,850
Will our prime minister plow
the field in every village?

1585
01:53:38,080 --> 01:53:41,900
Farm? It's up to
our country's youth...

1586
01:53:42,450 --> 01:53:44,650
to go educate people
in every village...

1587
01:53:44,790 --> 01:53:46,390
and teach them what to do.

1588
01:53:46,790 --> 01:53:51,170
Then wait and watch how
our country will progress.

1589
01:53:51,420 --> 01:53:54,110
But that's the problem.
Today's educated youth...

1590
01:53:54,530 --> 01:53:56,260
don't like to come
to these villages.

1591
01:53:57,040 --> 01:53:59,870
They prefer to stay in the city
and look for jobs there.

1592
01:54:02,490 --> 01:54:04,720
- You're upset again?
- Yes. - Why?

1593
01:54:05,670 --> 01:54:09,000
Because I didn't realize you would
lose confidence so easily.

1594
01:54:09,860 --> 01:54:13,050
Have you forgotten the day
when our battle for freedom...

1595
01:54:13,170 --> 01:54:15,470
- was begun by one man?
- But what can be done now?

1596
01:54:16,010 --> 01:54:17,510
Just what we've been doing.

1597
01:54:19,020 --> 01:54:22,480
Look... with our
concerted efforts...

1598
01:54:23,540 --> 01:54:25,750
this barren earth
has borne fruit.

1599
01:54:26,210 --> 01:54:28,850
But transforming a
small piece of land will not...

1600
01:54:29,010 --> 01:54:30,410
satisfy the nation's hunger.

1601
01:54:31,800 --> 01:54:33,530
I think of that sometimes, too.

1602
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:37,950
But we may have to give
our lives to fulfil our duty.

1603
01:54:38,150 --> 01:54:40,050
But how will we fight alone?
For how long?

1604
01:54:40,810 --> 01:54:41,910
Alone?

1605
01:54:43,700 --> 01:54:45,000
I'm with you.

1606
01:54:45,830 --> 01:54:47,700
And when I'm with you...

1607
01:54:48,910 --> 01:54:51,510
why do you think
of yourself as alone?

1608
01:54:51,770 --> 01:54:52,970
You're right.

1609
01:54:56,630 --> 01:55:00,900
Then promise me
you will never despair.

1610
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:02,960
I promise.

1611
01:55:03,510 --> 01:55:06,140
- And you won't sit around moping?
- No.

1612
01:55:07,240 --> 01:55:08,860
And believing Jeet [victory]
is yours...

1613
01:55:10,380 --> 01:55:12,770
- you will immerse yourself in your work?
- Alright.

1614
01:55:13,260 --> 01:55:15,730
Happy? Come, let's go.

1615
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:18,670
If he has invited you
to the festival,

1616
01:55:18,720 --> 01:55:20,970
- you should certainly go.
- No, mother...

1617
01:55:21,300 --> 01:55:22,720
we won't go there.

1618
01:55:22,970 --> 01:55:25,850
This seems to be my father's and
Ratan babu's ploy, mother.

1619
01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:28,230
Yes. How can we
trust them?

1620
01:55:28,690 --> 01:55:30,750
Who knows? They might set up
another obstacle.

1621
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:33,600
But we have to confront obstacles,
not ignore them.

1622
01:55:33,750 --> 01:55:35,610
Yes, and that takes courage.

1623
01:55:36,110 --> 01:55:37,680
You should certainly go.

1624
01:55:40,500 --> 01:55:41,600
Friends...

1625
01:55:43,090 --> 01:55:45,690
seeing you here today...

1626
01:55:46,150 --> 01:55:48,250
gives me great happiness.

1627
01:55:48,970 --> 01:55:50,540
Jeet? Vijay?

1628
01:55:50,870 --> 01:55:52,656
Why are you sitting there?
Come here...

1629
01:55:52,680 --> 01:55:54,210
sit on the chairs.
Come.

1630
01:55:54,410 --> 01:55:55,960
No, uncle. We're fine here.

1631
01:55:56,420 --> 01:55:59,530
Those who serve the people will
only sit amongst them.

1632
01:55:59,990 --> 01:56:03,400
Everyone, say, victory to Miss Jeet.
Victory to Vijay babu.

1633
01:56:03,480 --> 01:56:04,960
- Silence! - Victory!
- Silence.

1634
01:56:05,100 --> 01:56:07,810
- Say, 'Be calm'. - Victory!
- Be calm, everyone. Be calm.

1635
01:56:08,890 --> 01:56:11,770
Have you come here to chant victory
slogans or for the entertainment?

1636
01:56:12,500 --> 01:56:14,210
Please sit quietly...

1637
01:56:14,540 --> 01:56:16,550
and listen carefully to the
Thakur saheb's speech.

1638
01:56:17,030 --> 01:56:19,230
- Yes, Thakur saheb, continue...
- You are right.

1639
01:56:20,630 --> 01:56:24,670
Friends, er.. we feel...

1640
01:56:25,290 --> 01:56:28,570
that without ensuring your
prosperity and happiness...

1641
01:56:28,940 --> 01:56:30,640
we cannot be happy
or prosperous either.

1642
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:34,970
So... please think of us as
one of your own...

1643
01:56:35,240 --> 01:56:37,470
and believe in us.

1644
01:56:37,960 --> 01:56:39,060
And...

1645
01:56:40,920 --> 01:56:43,920
That makes sense!
Why don't you tell them?

1646
01:56:45,550 --> 01:56:48,970
Look, you are immersed
in your work day and night.

1647
01:56:49,810 --> 01:56:52,840
Despite all your hard work,
you can't afford two square meals.

1648
01:56:53,300 --> 01:56:54,600
This is shameful.

1649
01:56:55,020 --> 01:56:56,530
When I was in America...

1650
01:56:56,670 --> 01:57:00,590
O American saheb! We are dying
of hunger thanks to people like you.

1651
01:57:01,320 --> 01:57:04,120
What's the use of arguing
about that now...

1652
01:57:04,380 --> 01:57:07,020
about why our countrymen
are dying of hunger?

1653
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:11,140
It is said, 'Bury the past,
and...

1654
01:57:11,240 --> 01:57:12,640
look to the future.'

1655
01:57:13,150 --> 01:57:17,150
Now... we wish to tell you...

1656
01:57:17,410 --> 01:57:19,700
how you can all be prosperous.

1657
01:57:19,900 --> 01:57:22,220
Yes, my friends. Take the
case of America...

1658
01:57:22,650 --> 01:57:24,560
The jobs there, the trade...

1659
01:57:24,970 --> 01:57:27,020
business... why is it
progressing so much?

1660
01:57:27,460 --> 01:57:29,080
Because machines
do the work there.

1661
01:57:29,840 --> 01:57:31,450
Even farming is done
by machines.

1662
01:57:32,120 --> 01:57:34,040
You should also get machinery
to work your farms.

1663
01:57:34,520 --> 01:57:37,470
And as you watch, your fields
will be plowed...

1664
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:39,220
your crops harvested...

1665
01:57:39,530 --> 01:57:41,650
your homes will be
overflowing with grain.

1666
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:44,280
Where will the money come from
to buy these machines?

1667
01:57:44,500 --> 01:57:46,000
That's a great question.

1668
01:57:47,160 --> 01:57:50,450
The money that we have
collected so far...

1669
01:57:50,740 --> 01:57:53,190
when will it be
of some use? We...

1670
01:57:53,290 --> 01:57:55,120
will buy the machines
with our money.

1671
01:57:55,280 --> 01:57:56,770
And lend it to you.

1672
01:57:57,280 --> 01:58:01,870
You can repay us slowly by
giving us a part of your yield.

1673
01:58:03,560 --> 01:58:07,770
Now, whatever we wanted
to explain to you...

1674
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,090
we want you to
understand it well.

1675
01:58:10,420 --> 01:58:15,270
So now, watch this
small dance item in peace.

1676
01:58:36,880 --> 01:58:41,810
Work, my friends, work.
Make your mark in this world

1677
01:59:11,060 --> 01:59:19,060
Why do you toil so hard all day?

1678
01:59:20,520 --> 01:59:28,360
And yet, you starve to death

1679
01:59:40,370 --> 01:59:42,970
Why endure sorrow,
why lose your life?

1680
01:59:45,870 --> 01:59:51,070
Come, I offer you
a haven, come, come to me

1681
02:00:06,460 --> 02:00:09,150
What you do in years

1682
02:00:09,210 --> 02:00:11,780
I can do in minutes

1683
02:00:17,470 --> 02:00:21,440
Worship me... worship me
and you will be happy

1684
02:00:24,400 --> 02:00:29,410
Come, I offer you
a haven, come, come to me

1685
02:00:35,120 --> 02:00:38,980
O Goddess, to worship you

1686
02:00:39,190 --> 02:00:42,380
We will need a heap of riches

1687
02:00:51,750 --> 02:00:54,540
Where can we get
the gold and silver?

1688
02:00:54,640 --> 02:00:57,300
How can we approach you?

1689
02:01:09,790 --> 02:01:13,650
We are your servants, my friend

1690
02:01:13,920 --> 02:01:16,530
We are your followers

1691
02:01:23,660 --> 02:01:26,240
Come, come with us

1692
02:01:26,380 --> 02:01:28,950
Rid us of our differences

1693
02:01:29,140 --> 02:01:30,890
And with these new machines

1694
02:01:30,920 --> 02:01:34,600
Pile up heaps of riches

1695
02:01:47,110 --> 02:01:49,690
Why endure sorrow,
why lose your lives?

1696
02:01:52,650 --> 02:01:58,050
Come, I offer you
a haven, come, come to me

1697
02:01:58,520 --> 02:02:01,230
Stop this farce! This is just a ploy
to trap us farmers.

1698
02:02:01,440 --> 02:02:03,856
That's right! These landowners
will turn us into debtors.

1699
02:02:03,880 --> 02:02:06,150
- That's right! - That's true.
- That's right!

1700
02:02:06,300 --> 02:02:09,330
Nonsense! Vijay has
misled you.

1701
02:02:09,820 --> 02:02:12,790
We're talking about your well-being,
and you don't understand us?

1702
02:02:13,150 --> 02:02:15,390
- Uncouth rustics!
- Ratan babu...

1703
02:02:16,170 --> 02:02:18,520
you have no right to
call these people names.

1704
02:02:18,820 --> 02:02:22,270
This is between us landlords and
farmers. Who are you to interfere?

1705
02:02:22,510 --> 02:02:23,910
Be quiet, Ratan babu.

1706
02:02:26,150 --> 02:02:28,650
Miss Jeet and Vijay babu
show us the right way.

1707
02:02:29,180 --> 02:02:30,980
If you say anything
against them...

1708
02:02:31,340 --> 02:02:33,496
- it wouldn't be wise.
- Yes, it certainly wouldn't be wise.

1709
02:02:33,520 --> 02:02:35,590
[Muffled shouts and exclamations.]

1710
02:02:35,640 --> 02:02:38,100
Be quiet! Please don't
get angry...

1711
02:02:38,950 --> 02:02:41,420
Ratan babu wasn't
so far off the mark.

1712
02:02:42,710 --> 02:02:46,100
There's nothing wrong with using
machines to farm. But, for now...

1713
02:02:47,020 --> 02:02:48,720
we have to stick to our plows.

1714
02:02:49,760 --> 02:02:53,680
We don't want spend our money
to import machinery from abroad.

1715
02:02:54,130 --> 02:02:56,190
When our country begins
to produce machinery...

1716
02:02:56,750 --> 02:02:59,600
then we will use
machines to farm.

1717
02:02:59,870 --> 02:03:04,080
Okay. The poor will not be
the slaves of the rich for this.

1718
02:03:04,820 --> 02:03:07,110
When our country becomes
truly independent...

1719
02:03:07,750 --> 02:03:10,500
- then this too will follow.
- Miss Jeet is right.

1720
02:03:11,120 --> 02:03:13,886
We will not listen to them
anymore. Come on, friends.

1721
02:03:13,910 --> 02:03:21,910
[Let's go. Come on.]

1722
02:03:34,040 --> 02:03:37,170
Brother... I can't think of
anything any more.

1723
02:03:37,440 --> 02:03:40,220
No, uncle. We can't
admit defeat so easily.

1724
02:03:40,890 --> 02:03:43,790
I wish that the flames of vengeance
burning in my heart...

1725
02:03:44,050 --> 02:03:45,820
set my enemies ablaze.

1726
02:03:46,210 --> 02:03:50,070
Arre, why don't you leave the burning
and the setting enemies ablaze to us?

1727
02:03:50,760 --> 02:03:53,400
And you won't find even a trace
of your enemies' ashes.

1728
02:03:53,690 --> 02:03:55,820
Bravo! Now you speak sense!

1729
02:03:56,570 --> 02:03:59,110
Nonsense! Then we'll all be
in the clutches of the law!

1730
02:04:00,920 --> 02:04:02,770
You're still an innocent,
my lord.

1731
02:04:03,110 --> 02:04:05,410
If you are so scared, then
learn to tolerate it.

1732
02:04:05,860 --> 02:04:10,500
He speaks sense! My friend, the time
to scare and be scared has passed.

1733
02:04:10,860 --> 02:04:13,200
It's a matter of
our life or death.

1734
02:04:13,630 --> 02:04:16,646
I say we need
to clear the field.

1735
02:04:16,670 --> 02:04:19,086
Then, Thakur saab, why don't you
watch the immolation today itself?

1736
02:04:19,110 --> 02:04:22,160
- Bless you. - Yes.
- Alright, then come with me. - You said it.

1737
02:05:36,140 --> 02:05:39,170
Jeet, come quickly. Madam,
they are setting fire to your house.

1738
02:05:46,620 --> 02:05:49,596
- Our house is also burning!
- My home is also burning?

1739
02:05:49,620 --> 02:05:57,620
[Shouts and screams continue;
confusion abounds.]

1740
02:06:04,260 --> 02:06:09,370
- We are destroyed.
- There's nothing left. - We're shattered.

1741
02:06:09,450 --> 02:06:13,360
Look, madam, the fire at Vijay babu's
hut has destroyed the village.

1742
02:06:13,910 --> 02:06:15,650
Forget that our huts
burned down...

1743
02:06:16,220 --> 02:06:18,826
but Miss Jeet's and your mansions
have also been razed to the ground.

1744
02:06:18,850 --> 02:06:22,900
Why don't you just say that
my house burned down too?

1745
02:06:23,670 --> 02:06:25,170
This is all Ratan babu's...

1746
02:06:25,250 --> 02:06:28,070
and Miss Kiran's father's fault.

1747
02:06:28,760 --> 02:06:30,740
He claims to be a patriot...

1748
02:06:30,930 --> 02:06:32,910
You haven't really
understood Kiran yet.

1749
02:06:33,170 --> 02:06:35,440
If this fire has inflamed
your passions...

1750
02:06:35,580 --> 02:06:36,980
then, come with me.

1751
02:06:37,340 --> 02:06:39,840
I can't listen to your taunts
all my life.

1752
02:06:39,970 --> 02:06:41,670
- Come one! - Let's go
- Kiran!

1753
02:06:42,160 --> 02:06:43,690
Kiran! Listen!

1754
02:06:45,260 --> 02:06:46,780
Vijay! Jeet!

1755
02:06:47,650 --> 02:06:49,890
See this? This is
my plight!

1756
02:06:50,500 --> 02:06:54,240
- My house is razed to the ground.
- Nonsense! What can I do?

1757
02:06:54,480 --> 02:06:57,620
What's my fault? The fire
razed the entire village.

1758
02:06:57,810 --> 02:07:00,620
My house is destroyed too.
When I was in America...

1759
02:07:00,730 --> 02:07:03,520
Just shut up! America, America,
all the time!

1760
02:07:03,950 --> 02:07:07,070
This is your fault. It was
your idea to set the fire.

1761
02:07:07,240 --> 02:07:09,190
Nonsense! This was my idea?

1762
02:07:09,420 --> 02:07:11,910
You were the one who
raised the idea of a blaze.

1763
02:07:12,030 --> 02:07:14,070
Now you blame me?
Aren't you ashamed?

1764
02:07:14,110 --> 02:07:16,550
- Was it my fault?
- So it was my fault? - No, it was mine.

1765
02:07:16,630 --> 02:07:24,630
Damn you!
[Shouts of a furious crowd.]

1766
02:07:26,450 --> 02:07:28,510
What are you doing?
What are you doing, you lot?

1767
02:07:29,230 --> 02:07:32,110
Friends... I'm not
at fault here.

1768
02:07:32,300 --> 02:07:33,930
- It's all his fault.
- Uncle!

1769
02:07:34,490 --> 02:07:36,980
You're insulting me
in front of all these people.

1770
02:07:37,380 --> 02:07:39,990
Friends, Thakur saab
is to blame for all this.

1771
02:07:40,020 --> 02:07:42,030
Don't malign my father.

1772
02:07:42,200 --> 02:07:43,900
Friends, both of them
are to blame.

1773
02:07:44,110 --> 02:07:45,650
- Kiran!
- Father!

1774
02:07:46,270 --> 02:07:51,210
That age where man stayed quiet when
humanity was destroyed has long gone.

1775
02:07:51,430 --> 02:07:54,620
My dear... Kiran...
what are you saying?

1776
02:07:54,800 --> 02:07:57,310
Remember I'm your father?

1777
02:07:57,600 --> 02:08:00,720
- Your father!
- I know that you're my father.

1778
02:08:01,030 --> 02:08:03,720
But as the Bhagavad Gita tells us,
as our duty tells us...

1779
02:08:04,310 --> 02:08:06,330
that however great
the oppressor is...

1780
02:08:06,720 --> 02:08:08,390
we have to confront him.

1781
02:08:08,760 --> 02:08:11,350
But my dear,
whom have I oppressed?

1782
02:08:11,660 --> 02:08:13,820
You have not just oppressed us,
you have persecuted us.

1783
02:08:14,230 --> 02:08:17,430
Friends, let's show the men who
burn down others' houses...

1784
02:08:17,760 --> 02:08:19,630
how hot fire can burn.
Come on!

1785
02:08:19,870 --> 02:08:24,520
Chief! Arre, I didn't do anything.
Let me go! [Shouts in the background]

1786
02:08:24,550 --> 02:08:27,640
My dear... Kiran...
what are you doing?

1787
02:08:28,120 --> 02:08:30,350
You want to set
your father on fire?

1788
02:08:30,660 --> 02:08:32,180
Arre... Kiran...

1789
02:08:32,270 --> 02:08:34,280
Darling, take pity
on me, at least.

1790
02:08:34,690 --> 02:08:37,480
- I love you!
- And I consign such love to the flames!

1791
02:08:38,220 --> 02:08:39,850
Now I love the Truth.

1792
02:08:40,330 --> 02:08:42,210
Today, I want to
show the world...

1793
02:08:42,560 --> 02:08:45,230
what an Indian girl can do
in the pursuit of Truth.

1794
02:08:45,920 --> 02:08:47,020
Kiran!

1795
02:08:47,670 --> 02:08:49,570
Why do you want to
go down that path...

1796
02:08:50,270 --> 02:08:53,260
that has never benefited anyone?

1797
02:08:53,670 --> 02:08:56,480
Jeet, my sister...
what are you doing?

1798
02:08:56,750 --> 02:08:59,990
These people deserve
to be set ablaze.

1799
02:09:00,190 --> 02:09:03,100
They have razed an entire village
for their own selfish ends.

1800
02:09:03,500 --> 02:09:05,640
We can't win by taking revenge.

1801
02:09:06,240 --> 02:09:09,110
Killing evil people will not
eradicate evil from this world.

1802
02:09:09,880 --> 02:09:13,380
How many evil kings have been
decimated before this?

1803
02:09:13,930 --> 02:09:15,660
Men have destroyed each other...

1804
02:09:16,120 --> 02:09:19,160
but evil and oppression haven't ended.

1805
02:09:19,970 --> 02:09:22,440
We have to show the world
a new path forward.

1806
02:09:22,620 --> 02:09:24,870
If, even today, for our
own selfish ends, we...

1807
02:09:25,210 --> 02:09:26,950
keep humiliating each other...

1808
02:09:27,680 --> 02:09:29,480
destroying each other...

1809
02:09:29,770 --> 02:09:31,440
taking revenge
upon each other...

1810
02:09:31,820 --> 02:09:33,560
then these flames
will never be doused.

1811
02:09:34,160 --> 02:09:36,510
And like our village
was razed today...

1812
02:09:37,220 --> 02:09:39,800
the world will burn
in the fires of hatred.

1813
02:09:40,770 --> 02:09:42,080
Please release him.

1814
02:09:44,140 --> 02:09:46,410
Dear Jeet, if we set
these people free...

1815
02:09:46,650 --> 02:09:48,830
they will create trouble
of some sort again.

1816
02:09:49,290 --> 02:09:50,870
They can't do that anymore.

1817
02:09:51,410 --> 02:09:53,530
If we keep our humanity alive...

1818
02:09:54,350 --> 02:09:56,740
then evil can never
raise its head again.

1819
02:09:57,680 --> 02:10:00,400
We must win this world over
with love and peace.

1820
02:10:01,170 --> 02:10:04,470
If we let our anger blaze forth
and destroy these men...

1821
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:06,900
how will they see that day...

1822
02:10:07,390 --> 02:10:12,190
when our courage and unity will
turn this world into paradise?

1823
02:10:13,090 --> 02:10:14,890
Their eyes will be
opened to the truth.

1824
02:10:15,610 --> 02:10:17,580
Our triumph lies
in letting them live.

1825
02:10:17,710 --> 02:10:21,520
- Say victory to... - Miss Jeet!
- Victory to... - Miss Jeet!

1826
02:10:25,280 --> 02:10:27,100
Mother... forgive me, mother.

1827
02:10:28,310 --> 02:10:30,460
- Vijay! Vijay...
- Ratan bhaiyya!

1828
02:10:32,800 --> 02:10:35,640
Vijay, in the end,
you were the victor.

1829
02:10:35,870 --> 02:10:37,070
No, brother.

1830
02:10:37,430 --> 02:10:40,480
It's not man but
ideals that triumph.

1831
02:10:41,280 --> 02:10:44,550
- It's a nation that triumphs.
- The country is our mother.

1832
02:10:45,470 --> 02:10:49,010
So one has to say that
the victory is mother's.

1833
02:10:49,250 --> 02:10:50,990
A mother has certainly triumphed...

1834
02:10:52,310 --> 02:10:55,150
but our entire village
has been destroyed.

1835
02:10:55,340 --> 02:10:58,910
Thakuraniji, I'm the main reason
for this destruction.

1836
02:10:59,690 --> 02:11:01,800
If I weren't greedy for wealth...

1837
02:11:02,240 --> 02:11:04,040
the village wouldn't be
in this state now.

1838
02:11:04,530 --> 02:11:06,730
I genuinely repent for my actions.

1839
02:11:09,950 --> 02:11:12,820
Mother, today everyone
is full of repentance.

1840
02:11:13,930 --> 02:11:16,010
Ratan babu will also support
us from today onwards.

1841
02:11:16,320 --> 02:11:20,420
Yes, this tragedy has
taught us so much.

1842
02:11:21,160 --> 02:11:23,440
We are cleansed
of all evil thoughts.

1843
02:11:24,780 --> 02:11:26,820
We have nothing today...

1844
02:11:27,830 --> 02:11:29,430
but it doesn't worry us.

1845
02:11:29,830 --> 02:11:31,780
When man came into this world...

1846
02:11:32,920 --> 02:11:34,410
he had nothing.

1847
02:11:35,480 --> 02:11:39,940
But he acquired wealth through
his hard work and struggles.

1848
02:11:41,090 --> 02:11:43,080
He established villages and big cities.

1849
02:11:44,440 --> 02:11:46,150
Now we will strive together...

1850
02:11:47,440 --> 02:11:49,630
and make this our dream world.

1851
02:11:50,960 --> 02:11:53,440
How difficult the path ahead...

1852
02:11:54,430 --> 02:11:56,590
however impenetrable the way...

1853
02:11:58,030 --> 02:12:01,670
we will forge ahead smiling.

1854
02:12:01,960 --> 02:12:05,630
However difficult the path ahead

1855
02:12:05,950 --> 02:12:10,360
We will continue to forge ahead

1856
02:12:10,820 --> 02:12:16,630
Moving forward, laughing and singing,
celebrating every step, we will forge ahead

1857
02:12:16,730 --> 02:12:20,310
However difficult the path ahead

1858
02:12:20,750 --> 02:12:24,940
We will continue to forge ahead

1859
02:12:25,460 --> 02:12:27,390
Moving forward,
laughing, singing...
