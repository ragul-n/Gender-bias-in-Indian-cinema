1
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:35,556
Perhaps no one would believe us

2
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:41,666
At border we soldiers always sleeps with one
eye open.

3
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:47,320
Don't we have to keep an eye on the move of
enemies?

4
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:54,388
After a while we close the other eye giving rest
to the one eye kept open.

5
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,596
Is that even possible to sleep with one eye
open?

6
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:04,422
'Nothing is impossible fora winning mind'
we're trained well in all tactics.

7
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:08,007
So soldiers are really great deal?

8
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:12,302
Dear Usman, you don't know a thing about
soldiers.

9
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,282
Haven't you heard 'stand guard with oil dripped
in your eyes?' it is no nonsense.

10
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:22,181
When a likewise situation comes up,
we do pour oil in our eyes, mustard oil.

11
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:27,778
Oh' that's why mustard oil is costlier, all
soldiers use it up to keep them awake.

12
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:34,254
Gandhiji and Nehru brought freedom butwho
maintains them?

13
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:46,300
When lwas in 37th battalion, lieutenant colonel
Rudrappa was really shaken up'

14
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:52,547
One of our frontiers is captured by Chinese
militants.

15
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:56,118
The only bridge left was bombed.

16
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:00,674
Oh my God!

17
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:06,040
We have to cross the border to recapture

18
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:09,316
but heavy rain and flood thrashing.

19
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:16,136
No one would believe, for my luck I got a
magnet and a rope.

20
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:22,486
Strapping the rope to the magnet I threw them
off...

21
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:28,168
Lieutenant colonel Rudrappa was startled]
shocked.

22
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:37,581
Fastening one end of the rope to a column,
I got ready to go across.

23
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:43,205
Even after colonel Rudrappa and soldiers tried
to stop me, I didn't budge.

24
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:51,400
Accepting it, I hang heavily...on the rope.

25
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:59,530
Those days l was not like this,
but a tall heavy young man of flame and energy.

26
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:25,946
What about the magnet you threw, where did
you found it?'

27
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,033
No...l wasjust asking.

28
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:44,564
Believe it or not, when borders are free off war,
us and the Pak soldiers buddy up.

29
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:50,642
We exchange their Rawalpindi arrack with our
Kargil liquor.

30
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:55,730
Festivals like Onam, Eid, and Christmas
are well celebrated together with feast.

31
00:09:56,796 --> 00:10:01,586
Feast prepared by Shekhar kutty is in
high demand for both INDIANS AND Pakistanis.

32
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:10,024
When Pakistanis call 'hey brother...' it is such a
comfort...

33
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:21,178
but my most famous preparation is 'stirfried
pumpkin leaf'.

34
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:35,788
Pakistanis is in so much love with my 'stirfried
pumpkin dish that they don't turn their head for
another dish.

35
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:40,173
Then how about we arrange a feast with the
STIR FRIED PUMPKIN LEAF as the main dish?

36
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,267
Sridhar? Don't you dare interrupt my
conversation...

37
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:50,876
I'll cut short what I have to say...

38
00:10:51,884 --> 00:11:02,806
During one of my feast Pakistanis were little late
mean while Indians finished my 'Stir fried
pumpkin'

39
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:11,670
Pakistanis who arrived impatiently craving for
my dish got disappointed.

40
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:16,576
In frustration they got into fistic quarrel with
the Indians....

41
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:20,992
Hah...and that's how Kargil War started in first
place.

42
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:23,810
I heard few other reasons for the cause of
Kargil war

43
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:29,207
You may hear different reasons butthis is the
Truth...so you better hear what I say. Got it?'

44
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,803
Stop!

45
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:46,621
If we got caught with him all our programs will
derail...so better escape.

46
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:50,821
Over there...fast...run...

47
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:52,005
Hey...hey...oracle...

48
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,612
Do we have our drummer behind us?

49
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,864
Don't stop...keep running

50
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:04,247
Ifl had them here in this field in
this mild windy day,

51
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:07,851
I would have shared another story of chattiwala
incident.

52
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:27,591
(Iottery)Looks like you don't have any luck this
time too

53
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:34,714
Narayan's time is going to change for good.

54
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:44,351
Move out man...

55
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:51,215
my heart won't take it, I'll be dead.

56
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:59,217
1...3...6...ouch...just miss.

57
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:01,950
First prize?

58
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:07,086
Go away...with your lottery business.

59
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,190
Lottery taken from this beggar is always waste.

60
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:10,901
You shouldn't say like that...

61
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:11,498
Like how?

62
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,651
Brother Narayan...! Add it to my credit...

63
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,100
Did Saidali's house construction finish?

64
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:30,557
Not even close, workers are in full swing in
day and night to finish it within two days.

65
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:34,874
How about a tea?

66
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,809
Yeah...a strong tea one, to keep me from
sleeping.

67
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:42,032
Oh my goodness...here comes the AK 47.

68
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:46,192
Brother Narayan...l got a trip today.

69
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:47,426
Enough with food...run...run...

70
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:54,400
Gothere...run...come...come...

71
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,436
He destroyed to my business.

72
00:13:57,436 --> 00:14:06,545
Move you...man...

73
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:11,317
GST is not the culprit here. You are our
nuisance...the real pain.

74
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:16,322
I had repeated countless times that please
don't show up here during business hours.

75
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:19,992
Do I have to go to a salon for a tea?

76
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:22,094
What are you saying?

77
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:25,931
Look at all this...people left them at the mere
sight of you.

78
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:27,569
Will you be able to pay forthem...will you?

79
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,636
Do I have Nipah virus to scare them off?

80
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:33,405
You are more deadly than Nipah.

81
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:38,544
Don't even think of meeting Qatar Saidali, he'll
finish you off.

82
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:43,902
Really? You're the only reason his house
warming got pushed to a week later.

83
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,586
Me...? How am I related to his house
construction?

84
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:56,662
Want to know the relation?

85
00:14:56,662 --> 00:15:03,636
Poor workers weretrapped in his bull shooting
and got stuck with their work.

86
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:09,475
Hah...that is the reason...! Can't you stop with
your bragging?

87
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:12,251
I don't think age is a matterfor speaking the
truth.

88
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:19,251
What is this new item?

89
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,721
Cake prompted another memory of an event.

90
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:32,589
No one would believe but it was 100ft in length.

91
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:42,207
Even after the whole party devouring the cake
only a portion of,

92
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:47,736
Finally Dingambaran Singh loaded the cake
on hisjeep to take it overto his home.

93
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:53,543
It took over a month for Digambaran Singh's
family to finish the cake.

94
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:15,646
Hey...! Whatever you say our place is really
something. Look ...no development at all.

95
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:19,563
Yeah...si

y people.

96
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:26,801
This road cannot take much. Still I'm going in
50 mph.

97
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:32,391
What 50 mph is a speed? In gulfwe start our
carat 50mph.

98
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:35,224
Watching our speed the Arabs ask 'hassa
saiyarra wa salooki?'

99
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:40,614
Says... 'What the heck? Is this a rocket or really
a car?

100
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:44,118
We hit the speed at 500mph and blast off the
speedometer.

101
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:49,375
Army man -Shekharan kutty'

102
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,423
Oh...he is my uncle, my 'kutty maman' younger
uncle'

103
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:13,532
Are you trying to be funny?

104
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,544
Then?

105
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:25,907
Then he will narrate the whole film storyto us.

106
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:36,622
Whaaat? How can someone enjoy movie
after they knew the whole story?

107
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:44,129
It is his money thrown all overfor movie
and the food, there is nothing to lose from it.

108
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:49,135
But once we group of friends decided to crash
his usual routine.

109
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:59,421
We watched the movie before he could get a
chance that tore him deep.

110
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:06,227
Another day he came forward with a new story.

111
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:24,442
Hey...hey...look where you going man...

112
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:59,398
He said how much of a fan he is of Jayan and

113
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:07,005
Jayan made his driverto take a photo of them
together

114
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:11,101
Aftertaking his address and wrapping him to a
hug...he left.

115
00:20:35,601 --> 00:21:00,025
More thrilling than Jayan's movie.

116
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:04,678
Dear son...from what I heard your uncle is a
rare piece.... a hard core rare piece.

117
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:24,384
Brother...

118
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:32,391
You're happy right?

119
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:39,898
What a question? Happy...? We were awesome,
that's why we arrived packing the whole.

120
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:41,733
Yeah...he clued me in

121
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:49,408
Where is Shekharan Kutty?

122
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:59,718
Until we reach here, he was gossiping
about uncle's blow smoke theories.

123
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:08,593
Any way please introduce your uncle, I really
want to know him.

124
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:12,802
You can ask around here...because Beeran
Kutty's fish is always fresh.

125
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:19,325
Oh sure...l'l
 be present even on National strike.

126
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:41,793
Oh God' ifl get caught up with him, I'll lose a
day.

127
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:43,749
Hello...good morning!

128
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:52,587
That's good to know, thanks...

129
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:13,135
While you prepare the tea, make it a strong one,
that's howl like it.

130
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:30,310
I want to be away from the town life, this place
is good...peaceful.

131
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:44,847
Owner of this house is moving on with an idea
of selling it. So lwas thinking to buy it.

132
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:55,200
That can be done easily. House owner Bhaskar
is my friend. Maybe I can put a word for you.

133
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,442
One son, he owns a travel agency in Sikkim.

134
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:07,593
Last month we visited. Beautiful place...
but the cold weather, uff...it is -4, freezing.

135
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:21,766
-4 are cold? When I was in service, I stayed in
Kashmir, Siachal and the temperature was -20.

136
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:31,870
Cold means...intense chill but we got a technic.

137
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:41,279
When the freezing temperature inside and
outside our body matches, it won't affect us.

138
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,215
I was there...

139
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:51,156
Mentioning the word Kargil war, I can feel the
blood pumping hard through my veins.

140
00:24:51,156 --> 00:25:08,540
Lansnayak Azhakappan from Tamil Nadu was
my best buddy.

141
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:27,792
I stormed towards Major Zacharia's room
and urged for permission to fight against.

142
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:41,873
I started towards the border.

143
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:47,254
'VANDE MATARAM' 'VANDE MATARAM' 'VANDE
MATARAM.I

144
00:25:55,020 --> 00:26:01,050
During that operation I killed about 20 pak
soldiers.

145
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:08,515
There are more than 100 army real life stories
left unsaid.

146
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:25,651
That's even better, in bedroom you can listen to
my stories lying down.

147
00:26:51,209 --> 00:27:01,820
You're wolfing down the food, were you
starving in your hostel?

148
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,479
Keep it here...

149
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,655
I don't know if my brother had dinner.

150
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:19,925
When you guys are not here, he stays.

151
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:28,974
Stop talking nonsense.

152
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:37,851
There is some definite muddle between them.

153
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:46,955
His heart is still owned by Anjali, another
reason he never remarried.

154
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:13,485
That sordid dweller is coming. he drained
my whole blood last time, still not satisfied.

155
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:15,214
Don't open the door until I say so.

156
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,726
It's me...Shekharan Kutty.

157
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:33,544
Since its Sunday we can have a lot of time to
chat.

158
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:42,786
Koshy Sir...Ko-oshy sir...Koshy sir...

159
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,004
Good morning!

160
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:06,971
Good morning...good morning...

161
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:13,144
Where you rushing off to on a Sunday.

162
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:15,658
If security is knife down that'll be Bodo
Terrorists.

163
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:28,626
No...
'

 call you.

164
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:29,627
Listen to me...

165
00:30:29,627 --> 00:31:13,137
I had apprehended thousands of them...koshy
sir...

166
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:18,291
Tejpal Singh took the only AK 47 left at the
camp to shoot pigs.

167
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:23,202
They are 11 in total againstjust me, alone.

168
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:47,472
if he drop dead with your hit, people will

169
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:51,852
That's not the end...your life will be behind the
bars. Life sentence.

170
00:31:57,115 --> 00:32:01,563
When they got the wind that I surrendered
without wasting a single bullet, got excited.

171
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:09,312
With turn of events, Iunging fonNard I scoot
over, snatching the AK 47 from one of them.

172
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,317
What happened to your house? Such a calm
and peaceful place.

173
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:43,663
No...not the same area not even in same
district.

174
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:52,581
Braggart terror?

175
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:03,816
The boy have good height, weight, hair and
really good moustache'

176
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:10,290
No...
 was just checking for something that he
doesn't have.

177
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:28,239
Lemme see

178
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:29,607
Nothing will change.

179
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:35,680
No! Lasttime when a boy settled in gulf wentto
meet the girl's family,

180
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:47,291
The girl asked that's what is called dowry.

181
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:48,246
It was you...?

182
00:33:55,233 --> 00:34:06,477
As both families like each other, why don't we
speed up the rest of the formalities?

183
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:07,466
Who is he?

184
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:17,427
So slight changes are asked to meet with us.

185
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:53,891
No trouble at all.

186
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:54,559
Come inside. Please take seats

187
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:55,514
Please sit down...

188
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:05,885
This is the boy's father 'Ramendran', this is his
wife Radha.

189
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:18,483
He is girl's uncle Shekharan.

190
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:19,250
I'm from gulf, great...

191
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:30,294
Great?

192
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,215
What is that?

193
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,109
It took me over a month to learn the method
from them

194
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:50,609
Once when our Lieutenant Colonel Rudrappa
had the same problem, he coiled down with pain

195
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:40,794
A small block of wood is kept in align with the
spinal cord.

196
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:51,319
After placing it overthe spinal cord,
take a huge hammer and strike for four times.

197
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:58,489
At the fourth strike back pain will be cured
thoroughly.

198
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:14,465
No...why? After hearing it my half pain is eased.

199
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:14,932
Uncle...?

200
00:37:14,932 --> 00:37:15,499
Ha?

201
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:24,008
Uncle...we're not here for a carpenter's job.

202
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:25,145
Refreshments are set out.

203
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:31,749
Even though he is in America,

204
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:34,809
he doesn't have anysort oftroubled behavior
like today's youngsters

205
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:41,492
He is crazy?

206
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:42,242
Yes...

207
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:53,691
He can't be hold responsible for that because I
too was a daring one, he got the same blood.

208
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:13,979
Indian President specially honored me.

209
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:22,395
we won't allow you to go before you show us
some of your acts.

210
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:39,784
We have a bike here.

211
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:59,003
Actually it's been a long time since I rode the
bike.

212
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:06,844
Uncle? Do you really need to do this?

213
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:12,583
You should shoot it clearly.

214
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:14,596
Let me first ride this thing, we can call them
later.

215
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,594
That's the main problems for new model bikes.

216
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:31,869
No...not the helmet, face cannot be seen if you
keep that...

217
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,825
Okay then start off systematically.

218
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:41,761
Run...escape...

219
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:08,107
We wrecked one of the fine alliance brought to
us through blessing.

220
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:15,216
He would have been in jail for mass murder
ifthe situation changed a little sideways.

221
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:25,611
Then I thought to stand up for our family's
pride.

222
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:37,035
By reason of your turbulent actions...my
daughter's life is spoiled.

223
00:40:42,039 --> 00:41:10,067
Mom...listen to what you speaks,
how can uncle be the reason for anything?

224
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:11,398
Mom you were a lot today.

225
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:38,714
This is nothing! In army Punjabis used
to stand in queue to taste my chicken curry.

226
00:41:44,768 --> 00:41:45,936
It's Kashmir...Kashmir.

227
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:56,313
Oh...i...Kashmir and Punjab are close places,
a stop difference don't make much differences.

228
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:57,974
Uncle! Can I ask you a question?

229
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:19,343
We can talk about other first and then this,
Kashmiri chicken is best.

230
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,362
How did you meet her?

231
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:55,940
Please tell us about your epic love story.

232
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:59,774
I first met her at my teacher's home'

233
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:07,089
Actually her husband colonel Ragavan
Nam biyar helped me join in the Army.

234
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:15,369
Anjali is her granddaughter.

235
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:30,741
later it turn out to be a little fondness,
gratitude...

236
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:34,131
Kargil war started at the most unexpected time,

237
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:42,687
When I was back from the war
Anjali and Teacher were gone some place far.

238
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,383
Then how did you marry her?

239
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:08,979
Shekharan Kutty...

240
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:17,421
87...

241
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:18,889
Why the heck are you here?

242
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:20,493
To marry you off

243
00:44:24,895 --> 00:44:28,729
No much liability, average education! That was
your demand, right?

244
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:44,748
Singular?

245
00:44:44,748 --> 00:44:51,893
The prefer register marriage without much
fancy fuss and want to live in Bangalore after.

246
00:44:55,225 --> 00:45:02,499
Possibly she doesn't want to resign herjob
after all.

247
00:45:02,499 --> 00:45:06,242
I think I have a better idea, I'll ask them
to take on your sister and her children too.

248
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:15,613
I have brought countless proposals, every
single one you rejected with silly reasoning.

249
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:23,893
Oh my...my...hand...

250
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:52,456
But I did what you want.

251
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:10,925
If teacher was here, she'll be the happiest
person for our marriage.

252
00:46:26,216 --> 00:46:35,325
Think about it...if that bullet has fallen offthe
cliff with you.

253
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:36,960
What you mean?

254
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,417
I mean you're talking some clueless things...

255
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:46,997
You're clearly mistaken.

256
00:46:56,246 --> 00:47:35,986
Why are you laughing?

257
00:47:35,986 --> 00:47:36,827
I don't know.

258
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:45,934
I was emotionally drained.

259
00:48:11,154 --> 00:48:11,989
Not asingle clue?

260
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:12,456
Nope.

261
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:20,397
He was narrating the story of two hit cinema.

262
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:29,940
In the film when the train screeches pacing
forward,

263
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,134
....He himself as Spiderman.

264
00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:38,348
Exactly!

265
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:46,690
In the film Suresh Gopi tried all his tricks,
still Shobhana have no clue of who he is?

266
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:47,991
Aye...nope...

267
00:48:47,991 --> 00:48:56,366
He is still crazy about movies.

268
00:48:56,366 --> 00:48:57,267
Tsk...Tsk...

269
00:48:57,267 --> 00:49:13,550
Not tsk. He is your little uncle,
only thing keeping me off from bursting.

270
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:16,030
I couldn't get a wink of sleep thinking about
uncle.

271
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:40,010
Why? You want to join there?

272
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:56,593
We can hear her side of story.

273
00:49:56,593 --> 00:49:58,140
Listen...that is the truth.

274
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:22,686
Excuse me

275
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:31,428
Can you ask yourAunt to recommend mefor
some job here, I'm okay even with a janitorjob

276
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:32,562
Go straight and turn left.

277
00:50:32,562 --> 00:50:38,535
To the left?

278
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:40,924
Despite your spelling errors your English
sound tip-top.

279
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:48,045
Come on...don't play games.

280
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:49,239
That is some peaches'

281
00:51:14,871 --> 00:51:22,846
My friends pushed my alliance with Shekharan
Kutty.

282
00:51:22,846 --> 00:51:36,893
A simple yet a bashful person. Less talks and
more silence.

283
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:40,693
Like he was in an excitement phase.

284
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:54,727
After marriage his attitude changed entirely.

285
00:51:56,213 --> 00:52:07,124
A behavior no one could stomach, bogus
stories...

286
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:09,513
You know? I have never been to Kerala.

287
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:36,286
Each passing day made things more
complicated.

288
00:52:36,286 --> 00:52:51,701
Meet Dr. Vimal, he is a psychiatrist.

289
00:52:51,701 --> 00:52:57,741
What will you have?

290
00:52:57,741 --> 00:53:02,599
Anjali and I are close friends, she hinted about
the few troubles.

291
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:13,059
No...Shekharan Kutty.

292
00:53:20,597 --> 00:53:23,555
Mr. Vimal. Our marriage life is our private
matter.

293
00:53:29,472 --> 00:53:30,723
Trying to scare me off with English?

294
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:50,838
Pack him as soon as possible or I'll...

295
00:54:05,842 --> 00:54:07,241
Idenied...

296
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:43,500
You can stop rolling eyes at me. I can't keep my
mouth shut anymore.

297
00:54:50,086 --> 00:55:00,063
Make sure everyone get a good work out.

298
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:16,913
Hello...Shekharan Kutty, we're leaving.

299
00:55:16,913 --> 00:55:27,324
What is this? Tea and snack?

300
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:30,623
Ghee rice and chicken curry will be ready for
lunch.

301
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:40,103
The only best thing turn out from the welfare
meeting sponsored

302
00:55:40,103 --> 00:55:45,875
by him in every month is the ghee rice and
chicken fry.

303
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:47,944
That is a curt opinion.

304
00:55:47,944 --> 00:55:53,325
It is only because of him we're able to keep in
touch.

305
00:55:56,152 --> 00:56:07,597
One rank, one pension should be in complete
order.

306
00:56:07,597 --> 00:56:23,847
What good can it bring?

307
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:26,998
Silent against whatever rudeness they spit.

308
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:44,167
I had to think about my family

309
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:46,556
A single blow is enough, they would never walk
straight.

310
00:56:51,441 --> 00:56:57,585
I'll remind you one thing until our needs are
met we'll keep fighting.

311
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:04,053
During Chinese war...

312
00:57:04,053 --> 00:57:10,727
Stop right there...

313
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:11,628
Chinese war...

314
00:57:11,628 --> 00:57:24,607
Reach an agreement without filing a case.

315
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:41,591
I'm the only head here, if you want to make a
settlement without a case, bring money.

316
00:57:41,591 --> 00:57:54,237
A boy is been waiting for a long time to meet
you.

317
00:57:54,237 --> 00:57:54,896
Sir...

318
00:58:02,278 --> 00:58:05,987
Sir, my name Murughan, my house is nearthe
village office.

319
00:58:13,256 --> 00:58:13,915
Your father?

320
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:22,847
It is just me and my sister now.

321
00:58:33,209 --> 00:58:41,618
the documents and terrorizing us to vacate the
house.

322
00:58:41,618 --> 00:58:42,164
Kuppu swamy'

323
00:59:08,745 --> 00:59:10,554
Use that money to get out of this place.

324
01:00:13,209 --> 01:00:16,679
Looks like you filed police complaint against
me.

325
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:34,197
Ten days...you should clearthe house, if not...

326
01:00:50,413 --> 01:00:51,744
What is this?

327
01:02:01,818 --> 01:02:02,952
Gas is very costlier now a days!

328
01:02:02,952 --> 01:02:04,353
Selling expired soda?

329
01:02:04,353 --> 01:02:06,218
Brother...
Shekharan kutty house?

330
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:39,956
Ahh..

331
01:02:39,956 --> 01:02:40,890
You're not allowed to change it...

332
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:48,531
Change? Tell me what's going on?

333
01:02:48,531 --> 01:02:51,773
They're from Tamil Nadu to meet our Vaunt
Shekharan Kutty.

334
01:02:55,271 --> 01:03:02,188
I conversed with my little knowledge in Tamil
and found their mother is dead and they are
here for their father.

335
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,443
In Kerala if somebody needs help in finding an
address,

336
01:03:34,443 --> 01:03:37,048
the whole town will help them. Such a beautiful
place.

337
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:43,559
Oh god, the whole village approaching.

338
01:03:58,634 --> 01:04:06,442
What's going on?

339
01:04:06,442 --> 01:04:15,251
Those children are here for their father,
Shekharan kutty!

340
01:04:15,251 --> 01:04:17,420
Don't create a scene, people will talk.

341
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:19,991
I think you don't leave any one...look at those
people.

342
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:26,931
That is a lot of people.

343
01:04:50,453 --> 01:04:51,852
Please...stop talking.

344
01:04:55,258 --> 01:04:56,392
Let me call him.

345
01:04:56,392 --> 01:05:19,682
I had tried many times, it seems to be that he
took a hint and escaped.

346
01:05:19,682 --> 01:05:38,668
Don't stress, it's just an auto....

347
01:05:38,668 --> 01:05:39,919
He is still unconscious.

348
01:05:46,042 --> 01:05:47,543
We should find a solution for the Tamil
Children.

349
01:05:47,543 --> 01:05:56,585
Or else what? M.G.R will slash my neck?

350
01:05:56,585 --> 01:05:58,098
You sit here and you over there.

351
01:06:05,027 --> 01:06:07,163
Sure. Butwhere is it?

352
01:06:07,163 --> 01:06:31,387
I'm not sure. Look around in his home.

353
01:06:31,387 --> 01:07:54,837
Give the phone to mom.

354
01:07:54,837 --> 01:07:57,294
Your 'brother Jayan.‘

355
01:08:25,201 --> 01:08:27,442
I think he hid the letter for that reason.

356
01:08:32,741 --> 01:08:36,654
The whole town thinks you cooked up the Jayan
story, even Ithought you were blowing smoke.

357
01:08:42,084 --> 01:08:43,972
hang it at the entrance of 'Panchayath office
building.'

358
01:08:51,660 --> 01:09:03,405
but now it's different, people will accuse that
you used computerto edit the photo,

359
01:09:03,405 --> 01:09:12,548
Also every single person knows Jayan.

360
01:09:12,548 --> 01:09:16,109
Don't draw unwanted fuss. Leave it at the same
place it is found.

361
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:51,287
How are you feeling now?

362
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:56,202
If you didn't save her from that dreadful place,
she won't be having a good life.

363
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:10,092
Still at the thought of it my body quakes a fear.

364
01:10:55,517 --> 01:10:55,937
Welcome sir.

365
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:34,823
We got beautiful girls from Kerala,
one night-Rs 2000 only. Food and drinks free.

366
01:12:47,763 --> 01:12:51,859
I'll be back in a minute, take yourtime to
choose.

367
01:13:05,481 --> 01:13:25,200
We're from different places.

368
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:28,670
We didn't allow them to use us. Please...help
us.

369
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:53,708
Where are you guys? Come...quick.

370
01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:07,900
I'm not going to kill you only because
we soldiers are not authorized to kill an Indian.

371
01:16:16,104 --> 01:16:18,789
...forget it all at this very night.

372
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:46,234
Everyone please get out...

373
01:16:46,234 --> 01:16:49,476
You were unconscious due to
the immediate shock, nothing to worry about.

374
01:16:56,111 --> 01:16:59,672
Hold on, you can complete that story when you
come back next time, now I'm little occupied.

375
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:16,098
No...actually I'm here for a person.

376
01:17:16,098 --> 01:17:16,644
Who?

377
01:17:24,339 --> 01:17:25,073
What is it?

378
01:17:25,073 --> 01:17:26,708
We're from kodagu.

379
01:17:26,708 --> 01:17:32,180
I met kurishingal few months back, during a
real state dealing.We got pretty close like family.

380
01:17:33,949 --> 01:17:36,873
After quite some time he stopped coming to
Kodagu.

381
01:17:43,258 --> 01:17:44,259
Got any photos with you?

382
01:17:44,259 --> 01:17:45,460
I got a selfie...

383
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:46,597
That can do...show it.

384
01:18:04,312 --> 01:18:05,677
Pavi...what are you doing there?

385
01:18:11,453 --> 01:18:12,821
Is he the Kurishingal you asked about?

386
01:18:12,821 --> 01:18:13,606
Same one.

387
01:18:14,189 --> 01:18:15,030
Sorry...brother-in-Iaw.

388
01:18:20,328 --> 01:18:22,330
Because of a very small misunderstanding in a
property deal,

389
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:26,968
I and my brother-in-Iaw had a small
disagreement.

390
01:18:26,968 --> 01:18:28,904
Thank goodness, there was not much trouble.

391
01:18:28,904 --> 01:18:37,946
lwas expecting a small blast.

392
01:18:37,946 --> 01:18:38,958
Right?

393
01:18:46,054 --> 01:18:48,158
Come on smile...relax...

394
01:18:56,765 --> 01:19:01,203
Alice...

395
01:19:01,203 --> 01:19:01,903
Brother! No!

396
01:19:01,903 --> 01:19:17,219
You cheated my sister...

397
01:19:17,219 --> 01:19:20,279
Kurishingal will be settled when he reach
kodagu.

398
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:28,079
Anjali...you got a registered Ietterfrom Kerala.

399
01:19:55,123 --> 01:20:01,196
Area under 73/2, 80 cent in Thrikotoor village at
Neduvatoor, place under your ownership

400
01:20:01,196 --> 01:20:11,573
have to be acquire in relation to the national
highway development.

401
01:20:11,573 --> 01:20:20,415
Special Tahsildar, National highway authority of
India,

402
01:20:20,415 --> 01:20:26,149
Maybe a property under yourfather's name.
As it is government matter, you should contact.

403
01:20:30,025 --> 01:20:32,949
That won't be an issue any more, we can
Google...

404
01:20:48,944 --> 01:20:52,539
The records clarified that Janaki teacher
gave the property to his son Subhash

405
01:20:57,085 --> 01:20:58,416
Subhash is yourfather?

406
01:21:06,995 --> 01:21:08,599
We can go to the site.

407
01:22:45,660 --> 01:23:58,299
Can we break the lock?

408
01:23:58,299 --> 01:23:59,140
Yes.

409
01:24:06,841 --> 01:24:09,674
Why are you staring grandmother? You don't
know me?

410
01:24:23,258 --> 01:24:25,293
You came for me.

411
01:24:25,293 --> 01:24:26,157
Grandma!

412
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:53,170
Anjali...

413
01:24:59,861 --> 01:25:00,930
Do you know him?

414
01:25:09,404 --> 01:25:10,268
He is in Army.

415
01:25:18,279 --> 01:25:27,422
Whenever he visits me, he brings the best kind
of sweets.

416
01:25:27,422 --> 01:26:30,385
How is it?

417
01:26:30,385 --> 01:26:32,933
You enjoy this status of life because of our
sweat and blood.

418
01:26:38,493 --> 01:26:40,302
I'll pull out your bloody tongue out,Au

419
01:26:47,302 --> 01:26:49,281
Can you do Amitabh Bachhan and Kamal
Hassan?

420
01:26:58,780 --> 01:26:59,735
Not much though.

421
01:27:06,988 --> 01:27:09,445
I wanted to be an extraordinary actor like
Jayan.

422
01:27:14,329 --> 01:27:18,425
Stick fighting...then body combat technique, I
learned well.

423
01:27:27,475 --> 01:27:30,103
Then Ijoined the army accepting to their
interest.

424
01:27:35,383 --> 01:27:54,402
Superstar in Malayalam.

425
01:27:54,402 --> 01:27:56,176
I was in Changlang operation team.

426
01:28:15,023 --> 01:28:19,881
Our plan was to get a clean escape from the
forest.

427
01:28:29,537 --> 01:28:33,314
My eyes caught a 6 feet long bamboo stick.

428
01:28:40,882 --> 01:28:47,617
Swirling the stick against
the flying grenades I applied the stick technic.

429
01:28:49,023 --> 01:28:53,141
I strike the pacing grenades with the rotating
stick.

430
01:28:58,533 --> 01:29:04,096
Finally we both made it out ofthe Changlang
forest without a single scratch.

431
01:29:08,476 --> 01:29:15,583
Teacher looks like she doesn't believe me.

432
01:29:15,583 --> 01:29:19,235
I lived with an Army man for fifty years.

433
01:29:27,061 --> 01:29:32,089
But his bragging is nothing as com pared to
yours.

434
01:29:37,171 --> 01:29:38,399
I said the truth.

435
01:31:01,456 --> 01:31:01,911
Hello

436
01:31:17,572 --> 01:31:18,140
Ammini?

437
01:31:25,279 --> 01:31:26,047
Ta-ta...

438
01:31:26,047 --> 01:31:26,615
Bye...

439
01:31:33,221 --> 01:31:33,921
Definitely.

440
01:31:33,921 --> 01:31:42,563
I love bike ride with my friends on MG road in
Bangalore.

441
01:31:42,563 --> 01:31:49,804
If there is a bike that I haven't ridden, that'll be
bullet.

442
01:31:49,804 --> 01:31:50,805
Ican ride later.

443
01:31:50,805 --> 01:31:52,056
Get off...please.

444
01:31:56,744 --> 01:31:58,632
No wishes should be left for later.

445
01:32:30,011 --> 01:32:31,000
Anybody help...

446
01:33:38,312 --> 01:33:39,677
I'm clueless with bike.

447
01:34:05,172 --> 01:34:09,290
Like the enduring stream mizzle of night sky

448
01:34:11,779 --> 01:34:16,136
Like the endless stretch of snowy moon's
bloom.

449
01:34:30,464 --> 01:34:36,027
Like someone gently murmurs the song into
the soul.

450
01:34:36,937 --> 01:34:42,352
Ever known to the secrets of life,

451
01:34:49,917 --> 01:34:55,037
Ever known to the unseen first love,

452
01:34:57,058 --> 01:35:01,654
Like the enduring streams mizzle of night,

453
01:35:16,444 --> 01:35:20,687
You're my sheer bliss seeks to the day

454
01:35:48,809 --> 01:35:54,224
You came as caress, in my every dream

455

My heart change into the shell trumpet filling...

456
01:36:07,428 --> 01:36:14,425
I streamed as the shadow of the sheer sun

457
01:36:27,515 --> 01:36:31,929
Like the enduring stream mizzle of night sky

458
01:36:34,054 --> 01:36:51,572
Like the endless stretch of snowy moon's
bloom,

459
01:36:51,572 --> 01:36:56,487
Like the enduring streams mizzle of night,

460
01:36:58,112 --> 01:37:02,651
Like the endless stretch of snowy moon's
bloom

461
01:38:20,327 --> 01:38:22,056
I'm afraid about his attitude.

462
01:38:27,701 --> 01:38:31,444
Anyways I'm sure of one thing, Iwon't return to
Bangalore.

463
01:38:48,522 --> 01:38:49,978
She said she loves someone.

464
01:39:03,704 --> 01:39:29,363
I know Shekharan Kutty well. He is perfect for
Anj...

465
01:39:29,363 --> 01:39:42,710
Why are you speeding?

466
01:39:42,710 --> 01:39:45,725
Even though you're not perfectly alright, you're
okay.

467
01:39:53,053 --> 01:39:55,101
Do you know, how long you have been
admitted in this hospital?

468
01:40:02,730 --> 01:40:03,958
I can't

469
01:40:20,147 --> 01:40:23,947
Few were saved and some went missing
including your dad.

470
01:40:32,059 --> 01:40:34,425
I can't even rememberthejourney.

471
01:41:24,378 --> 01:41:27,654
Life comes only once, we should not spend
to the last second in fighting.

472
01:42:37,718 --> 01:42:40,460
As the 20th year after Kargil war.

473
01:43:03,410 --> 01:43:08,643
Officers can give out the brave soldier's name
and their achievements.

474
01:43:23,897 --> 01:43:31,577
He stopped the enemy's troop, killed and
caught two of them alive.

475
01:44:39,273 --> 01:44:40,820
Azhakappan...Azhakappan.

476
01:45:33,427 --> 01:45:35,759
It's my dream to make Murughan a doctor.

477
01:45:41,468 --> 01:45:46,212
My heart is pounding to meet Seetha.
After this week I'll leave immediately.

478
01:46:02,122 --> 01:46:03,168
I understand.

479
01:46:19,172 --> 01:46:20,901
Bravo 3 to headquarters, over.

480
01:46:28,515 --> 01:46:31,029
I need retaliation against them who killed Indian
Soldiers.

481
01:46:38,859 --> 01:46:39,496
Sir, please...

482
01:46:47,467 --> 01:46:48,513
You may go now.

483
01:49:43,176 --> 01:49:47,954
Shekharan Kutty killed nearly 20 pak soldiers.

484
01:49:51,685 --> 01:49:59,683
An operation against Naga terrorist in Nagaland,
he did brilliant performance.

485
01:50:02,095 --> 01:50:08,443
He is a patriotic as well as a man of kindness
and sincerity to the people around him.

man of Compassion

487
01:51:39,793 --> 01:51:40,748
Don't Cry.

488
01:52:20,967 --> 01:52:40,353
Children of every soldier who sacrificed their
life for the country are children of all the Indians

489
01:52:40,353 --> 01:52:41,354
Yes, we should.

490
01:52:41,354 --> 01:52:44,949
We have to get the documents from Kuppu
swamy.

491
01:53:33,072 --> 01:53:34,903

Kargil war.

492
01:53:41,381 --> 01:53:42,015

493
01:53:42,015 --> 01:53:42,916

494
01:53:42,916 --> 01:53:43,905
Uncle got award.

495
01:54:09,609 --> 01:54:11,338

Kutty is from Govindhapuram.

498
01:54:36,636 --> 01:54:43,599
His performance in the troop against the Naga
terrorist was impressive.

499
01:55:01,961 --> 01:55:08,968
Not all vaunt said at no time

500
01:55:08,968 --> 01:55:33,126
Not all vaunt said at no time

501
01:55:33,126 --> 01:55:48,417
Not vaunt, no vaunt but the truth
Not flaunting, no vaunt...no vaunt, son...

502
01:56:11,531 --> 01:56:16,946
Nose deep in snow, in the heights of Kashmir
Fought like the fire

They are the children of an ARMY man
Azhakappan, who sacrificed his life for the
country

523
02:01:51,604 --> 02:01:53,208
You better don'ttry to scare me in the name of
land.

524
02:02:01,314 --> 02:02:01,882
Let's talk.

525

Don't create a fuss, I can ask for some money.

Take your hands off.

529
02:03:36,442 --> 02:03:38,774
Last week he got an award for bravery from the
president.

530
02:03:45,518 --> 02:03:47,019
You should have said earlier.

531
02:03:47,019 --> 02:03:55,027
I got little late to recognize him.

532
02:03:55,027 --> 02:03:56,529
How can I give that?

533
02:03:56,529 --> 02:04:31,764
Which is more important? Your life or the
document?

534
02:04:31,764 --> 02:04:33,015
I'm here...

535
02:04:49,548 --> 02:04:50,583
That can do.

536
02:04:50,583 --> 02:04:51,948
No more clarification.

537
02:04:57,122 --> 02:04:59,091
He killed 200 Pakistanis.

538
02:04:59,091 --> 02:05:06,165
Only 20.

539
02:05:06,165 --> 02:05:07,029
Take it!

540
02:05:25,618 --> 02:05:28,360
Notjust me, nobody will pull troubles against
them.

541
02:05:49,942 --> 02:05:51,176
Don't be scared.

542
02:05:51,176 --> 02:06:08,327
Not original.

543
02:06:08,327 --> 02:06:09,635
Acting?

544
02:06:26,378 --> 02:06:27,606
What about the issues there?

545
02:06:34,987 --> 02:08:53,392
There is someone here to see you.

546
02:08:53,392 --> 02:08:54,757
This story is nothing compared to my bullets.

547
02:09:02,501 --> 02:09:04,833
Dussehra celebration in minister's home.

548
02:09:08,273 --> 02:09:10,787
Exactly two minutes to 8'0 clock,

549
02:09:16,982 --> 02:09:20,930
No...don't interfare, they shot down security
guards and tried to get inside.

550
02:09:25,424 --> 02:09:30,305
When they could no longer stand against my
bullets, they tried escape in helicopter.

551
02:09:36,769 --> 02:09:41,627
My eyes caught on the big hydrogen balloon
brought for decoration.

552
02:09:45,377 --> 02:09:47,425
breaking it off from the ground, the balloon flew
UP

553
02:09:51,784 --> 02:09:55,732
Not that, the balloon took me straight to the
helicopter.

554
02:10:01,226 --> 02:10:04,821
On my front helicopter. When I got the perfect
window, I fired.

555
02:10:20,012 --> 02:10:23,402
[Crowd Talking]

556
02:10:29,321 --> 02:10:31,023
Hey! What? Where are you going?

557

Come here..

558
02:10:36,929 --> 02:10:38,908
What if they're talking the truth?

559
02:10:46,138 --> 02:10:48,709
Come...let us save ourselves.
