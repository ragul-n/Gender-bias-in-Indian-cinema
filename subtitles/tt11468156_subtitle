00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:36,663
1977, TADA
DEPARTMENT OF ARCHAEOLOGY

3
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,466
Hello, who is speaking?

4
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,570
-Is your dad at home, Dear?
-Wait, I'll call him.

5
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,272
Daddy, phone for you.

6
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,913
Hello, Inspector Ranjan here.

7
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,850
Sir, someone has been murdered
in the archaeological department.

8
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,485
The treasure found
at Tada site is missing, sir.

9
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:06,954
What happened over there?

10
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,956
I have informed Ranjan sir.

11
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,924
Please come here at once, sir.

12
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:14,561
KABADADAARI

13
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:21,168
A MAN IN DISGUISE

14
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,695
What are your daily activities?

15
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:04,031
A policeman's life is like

16
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,400
the old Government of India's
Doordarshan TV channel.

17
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:08,268
No changes whatsoever.

18
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:10,337
I will wake up at 6 o'clock sharp.

19
00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:12,739
After doing some
push-ups and pull-ups,

20
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:14,074
without fail

21
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:16,076
I'll be at the police station by 8:30.

22
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,913
Is the sub inspector of police
given a gun?

23
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:23,951
Traffic police doesn't get any weapon

24
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:26,053
let alone a gun.

25
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:27,988
Gun? What for, sir?

26
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:30,524
To shoot the ones without license?

27
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:32,059
-No.
-Then for what, sir?

28
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:35,128
You know, these boys under the guise
of riding a bike, do eve-teasing

29
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:36,897
and create public nuisance.

30
00:06:36,964 --> 00:06:38,932
I need a gun to shoot such riff-raffs.

31
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:41,802
And for how long you have been
a traffic sub-inspector?

32
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:42,736
Two years.

33
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:44,071
-So?
-Sir.

34
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:47,074
I've filed more cases than anyone
in the last two years.

35
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,410
I joined the police force
to work in the crime department.

36
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:53,580
Sir, give me just one chance.
If you set your heart, it can be done.

37
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:55,315
What's wrong with you?

38
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:58,352
You scored badly in the written test.
How can you expect to work in crime?

39
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,320
I was suffering from typhoid on that day.

40
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:02,689
Stop spinning yarns
like a school-boy.

41
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,358
Will you accept bribes?

42
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:07,961
-No.
-Hey!

43
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:11,832
If God gives you lemons,
you should learn to make lemonade!

44
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:13,367
-Sir?
-Otherwise,

45
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,235
you'll lose even your traffic post.

46
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:17,304
This place is like a temple donation box.

47
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:19,606
Why are you turning your back
to the Goddess of Wealth?

48
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:21,141
Go, attend to your work.

49
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,943
-Go, I say!
-Sir!

50
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,678
Your hobbies?

51
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:26,547
Hobbies...

52
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:29,483
Playing chess and watching crime series.

53
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:35,789
An ordinary soldier killed the king.

54
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,025
Yay! Super!

55
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:39,059
Don't feel bad.

56
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:40,727
You played very well, okay?

57
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:43,931
-I hope the children didn't trouble you.
-Not at all.

58
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:45,265
Come on, catch me.

59
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:49,469
Please take this
for this month's expenses.

60
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:51,939
-I don't need it, sir.
-Accept it, please.

61
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,474
-Thanks a ton, sir.
-Thank you.

62
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:55,776
Sex?

63
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,478
You know that I'm male, don't you?

64
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:00,180
I wasn't talking about your gender.

65
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:03,283
I asked if you have
prior experience in sex or not?

66
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,853
Oh! You want to know that.

67
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,588
No.

68
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:09,857
Not even once?

69
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,762
Okay, bye. Time just flew talking to you.

70
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,664
-Okay, thank you. Bye.
-All the best.

71
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:21,969
[sighs]

72
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:24,204
[mobile ringing]

73
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:32,012
-Hello, Mom.
-Do you like the girl?

74
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:35,449
I like all the girls.
And they like me too.

75
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:36,950
I thought I could marry

76
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,118
-one girl from each area.
-Hey!

77
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:38,986
Then what, Mom?

78
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:41,522
They talk from web series
to cricket and then they shake hands

79
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:43,156
saying they don't want
a cop for a husband.

80
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:46,426
Forget all that and listen to me.

81
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:49,630
Visit Lord Perumal temple
every Saturday and pray.

82
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:50,697
You'll witness the miracle.

83
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:54,234
Mom, I agreed to meet them
for your sake.

84
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:45,152
Velu, there's a deep pit on that side.

85
00:09:45,219 --> 00:09:46,353
Play over here.

86
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,412
[loud horrified scream]

87
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,952
Earlier there was
a big lake next to this area.

88
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,854
These could be corpses
swept from there.

89
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:57,057
I can't share any information
until we complete our investigation.

90
00:10:57,124 --> 00:10:58,425
You can leave now.

91
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:02,229
-Sir. Sir, one minute.
-What is it?

92
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:05,632
This skull was found in the area
where I work.

93
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:06,834
So?

94
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:09,803
Can I also join
in this investigation, sir?

95
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,672
Then shall I go home
and watch the cricket match?

96
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:13,473
-Sir...
-Focus only on your work.

97
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:17,177
Stick to clearing the traffic on the road
and getting your palms greased.

98
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:18,645
This is our job.

99
00:11:18,946 --> 00:11:21,982
These skulls look like
they are from the same family.

100
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:25,219
-That's why.
-Did the skulls talk to you or what?

101
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:29,156
Did they introduce themselves
as mother, father, and daughter to you?

102
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:34,127
Mr. Shakthi, there are so many out there
in the city riding without a helmet.

103
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,630
Go save their skulls first.

104
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:37,831
Nosey parker!

105
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:53,347
Earlier there was
a big lake next to this area.

106
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:55,449
These could be corpses
swept from there.

107
00:11:55,516 --> 00:11:58,185
I can't share any information
until we complete our investigation.

108
00:11:58,252 --> 00:11:59,486
You can leave now.

109
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:32,419
[mobile ringing]

110
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:33,587
Hello.

111
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,789
I am in the middle of work.

112
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:37,057
I'll be back soon.

113
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:39,293
Hey! Who is that?

114
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:41,728
Hello, mister! Who are you?

115
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,197
Who are you, man?

116
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,965
How dare you ask me that!

117
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:48,168
If I break your limbs in the station,
you will know who I am!

118
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:50,003
Department, huh?

119
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,372
Press.

120
00:12:52,673 --> 00:12:53,740
Press reporter.

121
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:55,742
Hey! First come up.

122
00:12:57,144 --> 00:12:58,645
Give me a hand, brother.

123
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:02,950
Ouch!

124
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:09,690
Hey! Don't you have the basic sense
not to trespass into a crime scene?

125
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,226
Which press do you belong to?
Show me your ID card.

126
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,660
Lockup News.

127
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:14,928
Show me a proper ID card,

128
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:17,497
or else you in lock-up
will be the news headlines.

129
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:18,732
Take it out.

130
00:13:21,702 --> 00:13:23,370
Lockup News editor Kum...

131
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:29,142
What are you doing here?

132
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,347
I was told skulls were found
when this place was dug up.

133
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:36,517
I came to see if I can get
a cover story for my paper.

134
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,651
At this time of night?

135
00:13:38,752 --> 00:13:41,088
Crime reporter has no
fixed working hours, sir.

136
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:43,090
Twenty-four hours on duty.

137
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:45,559
Most impressive!

138
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:50,731
You're taking a dig at me!

139
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:52,766
Give my ID card, sir. I'll leave.

140
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:55,102
Come to the station tomorrow
and collect it.

141
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:57,404
Sir, stop playing games with me.

142
00:13:57,471 --> 00:13:58,572
Why should I come?

143
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:01,041
-Return my card...
-Told you to come to the station.

144
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:02,910
-Got it?
-Sir... Sir!

145
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:04,511
Attitude with which
you spoke last night,

146
00:14:04,578 --> 00:14:06,747
I thought you must be
the new inspector in Crime branch.

147
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:08,682
-Now I am wiser...
-Morning, sir.

148
00:14:08,749 --> 00:14:10,250
...you are a traffic policeman.

149
00:14:10,751 --> 00:14:14,021
So we aren't considered
part of the police department?

150
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:16,757
You could say so.

151
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:19,593
Like the difference between
an iPhone and Korean phone, that's all.

152
00:14:19,927 --> 00:14:22,162
Return my ID Card
and I'll go my way.

153
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,098
I won't. What will you do?

154
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:30,871
Showing off your power, huh?
What else will a reporter do?

155
00:14:30,938 --> 00:14:32,806
Buy a paper and read it tomorrow, sir.

156
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:38,712
Praise be to Lord Ganesha.

157
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:40,113
-Sir!
-Come.

158
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:43,417
God, please grant
good sense to everyone.

159
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,818
Sit.

160
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:46,420
I said sit down!

161
00:14:47,588 --> 00:14:51,091
Read the newspaper on the table.

162
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:58,165
LOCKUP

163
00:14:58,866 --> 00:15:01,635
IS THERE A SHORTAGE OF MANPOWER
IN TAMIL NADU POLICE DEPARTMENT

164
00:15:01,702 --> 00:15:03,103
TRAFFIC POLICE IN CRIME INVESTIGATION

165
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,205
You escaped because it is election time.

166
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:07,875
And people don't use this paper
even to parcel food!

167
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:10,944
If this was the headlines
of any other paper,

168
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:13,514
department would have
buried us alive by now.

169
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,082
Sir, he has done this deliberately.

170
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:16,517
Why did you go there?

171
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,552
Sorry, sir.

172
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:21,154
I think it's a murder.

173
00:15:21,455 --> 00:15:23,891
That's why I tried to investigate it.

174
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:26,393
Look, that's a closed case.

175
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:29,496
I've already enquired thoroughly
with Inspector Dayalan.

176
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:33,100
Those skeletons were buried
under the ground decades ago.

177
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:35,269
We have 1000s of problems in the city.

178
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:36,370
It's election time.

179
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,138
Just do your work, okay?

180
00:15:38,205 --> 00:15:40,541
Sir, give me just one chance, please.

181
00:15:41,175 --> 00:15:43,777
No way.
This is the last warning.

182
00:15:43,911 --> 00:15:45,812
If you cross the like again...

183
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:47,414
Sorry, sir.

184
00:15:47,648 --> 00:15:48,715
Out!

185
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:01,028
Sir, don't lay a hand on me!

186
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:03,664
Sir, don't hit me!
Very wrong on your part.

187
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,732
Sir, tell him not to hit me.

188
00:16:07,835 --> 00:16:09,503
You're cooking it up, aren't you?

189
00:16:10,571 --> 00:16:12,773
Do you think we are imbeciles?

190
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:16,310
Give me one week's time, sir,
I'll return it for sure.

191
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:19,213
Sir, I'll definitely repay.
Ask him not to hit me.

192
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,114
You said the exact same thing
last month too.

193
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:22,649
Sir... No, sir...

194
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,117
I'll repay in a week.

195
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:25,919
I swear on God, sir!

196
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:27,554
Sir... Please, sir!

197
00:16:27,621 --> 00:16:28,822
Sir, don't!

198
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:30,991
[loud scream]

199
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:33,493
This time, I'm letting you off
with a broken finger.

200
00:16:34,094 --> 00:16:35,796
You've got one week.

201
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:37,631
Hey! Let's go.

202
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:47,808
[groaning]

203
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:50,310
Oh!

204
00:16:58,285 --> 00:16:59,853
Who are they, sir?

205
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:02,756
Riff-raffs from our area, sir.

206
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:04,925
I borrowed some money from them.

207
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:07,594
They broke my finger
for not repaying in time.

208
00:17:11,932 --> 00:17:13,433
Open this for me, sir.

209
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,509
-Let me do it, sir.
-It's okay, sir.

210
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:25,546
More than reporters
who stick to the truth,

211
00:17:26,013 --> 00:17:27,447
one who likes to be
a lackey in a political party

212
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:30,951
or a boot-licker to movie celebrities
is more in demand nowadays.

213
00:17:31,852 --> 00:17:34,855
The richer you are in this world,
your word is the law! Money talks!

214
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:39,493
I should be in the top rung
for all the cover stories I wrote.

215
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,395
I'm ill-fated!

216
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:48,335
I was a partner with a conniving cheat.

217
00:17:49,336 --> 00:17:53,807
I trusted him with my life,
but he betrayed me.

218
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:56,410
I lost all that I earned and saved.

219
00:17:57,211 --> 00:17:58,846
If I think about my life,

220
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:01,849
I feel like dying
in that metro construction pit.

221
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:04,952
This is a disgusting profession, sir.

222
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,728
By the way,

223
00:18:15,229 --> 00:18:17,998
I heard they buried this case
along with the decomposed bones.

224
00:18:18,065 --> 00:18:19,199
How do you know this?

225
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,336
I am in the media, sir.

226
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:25,105
I know what's happening
behind closed walls

227
00:18:25,172 --> 00:18:26,740
in your department from A to Z.

228
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:29,009
How many years
of drowning in this mire!

229
00:18:42,356 --> 00:18:45,859
Sir, can we order one quarter?

230
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:47,794
Hmm, go ahead.

231
00:18:48,529 --> 00:18:49,363
-Hey!
-Hey.

232
00:18:51,932 --> 00:18:53,467
Sir! Sir!

233
00:18:53,734 --> 00:18:55,702
-Stop the bike.
-Wait. I will. I will.

234
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:57,337
[groans softly]

235
00:18:58,272 --> 00:19:00,641
One minute, sir.
I'll be back.

236
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:04,044
Hey!

237
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:07,514
You think you are so great
and you're glaring at me, huh?

238
00:19:07,848 --> 00:19:08,982
Son of a gun!

239
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:12,819
Just because you've made it big in life,
you think you are the cat's whiskers!

240
00:19:12,886 --> 00:19:15,455
Do you intend cleaning the city?

241
00:19:15,556 --> 00:19:16,523
Fraud!

242
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,792
Even if you clean up a mongrel
and raise it as a pet,

243
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:20,727
that street dog will
always be a mongrel!

244
00:19:20,794 --> 00:19:24,698
Hey! Only I know your true colors!

245
00:19:25,232 --> 00:19:28,602
Even if you forget it, I won't!

246
00:19:29,136 --> 00:19:31,839
He doesn't deserve a banner!

247
00:19:31,905 --> 00:19:33,540
-I should stone him!
-Sir! It's public nuisance

248
00:19:33,607 --> 00:19:34,875
and police will be notified.

249
00:19:34,942 --> 00:19:36,944
-Shouldn't let him go scot-free.
-Listen to me, sir.

250
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,045
-Get a gun, sir.
-Careful.

251
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,947
-Let's shoot him.
-We'll do so in the morning.

252
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:41,682
Sir! Sir...

253
00:19:45,886 --> 00:19:51,158
No matter how far up you are,
I won't spare you.

254
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:58,165
I won't spare you wherever you go.

255
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,434
Dad!

256
00:20:01,735 --> 00:20:03,303
What happened?

257
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,105
He's drunk.

258
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:07,107
You are...

259
00:20:07,174 --> 00:20:08,575
I didn't drink.

260
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:11,945
-I asked your name.
-I am Shakthi.

261
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:14,047
Come in, Dad.

262
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:15,415
Watch your step.

263
00:20:15,949 --> 00:20:17,017
Right, sir.

264
00:20:17,084 --> 00:20:19,186
-I can walk by myself.
-Thank you.

265
00:20:19,286 --> 00:20:21,255
-You go home safe, sir.
-Okay. Goodnight.

266
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:28,462
Greetings, sir.

267
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:33,734
Sir, I've brought the case file
and forensic report you asked Mani.

268
00:20:34,268 --> 00:20:35,269
Take it, sir.

269
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:37,204
-Keep it confidential, sir.
-Thank you.

270
00:20:37,538 --> 00:20:39,339
Come up. I'm coming.

271
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,379
Sir, the files you asked for.

272
00:20:45,479 --> 00:20:47,481
-All papers intact?
-Yes, sir.

273
00:20:48,482 --> 00:20:51,919
Our finding based on
the carbon dating report,

274
00:20:51,985 --> 00:20:56,089
these bones belong
to a 30 to 32-year-old male.

275
00:20:56,723 --> 00:21:00,928
This is a 28 to 30-year-old female.

276
00:21:01,962 --> 00:21:05,966
This is an eight to ten-year-old child.

277
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:10,537
The child's bones have disintegrated
because of the tender age.

278
00:21:10,871 --> 00:21:15,576
Initially, I couldn't figure out if it
was death from natural causes or murder.

279
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:19,012
But noticing the way
these bones have been broken,

280
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:20,747
it seemed a bit unusual.

281
00:21:21,148 --> 00:21:22,115
At the same time,

282
00:21:22,182 --> 00:21:26,854
it can happen after the burial
due to the pressure of the mud.

283
00:21:27,054 --> 00:21:32,059
But the toy car found along
with the bones and other items

284
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,928
makes me suspect
this may be a murder.

285
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,701
Sir?

286
00:21:41,335 --> 00:21:43,070
These are the items I mentioned.

287
00:21:55,349 --> 00:21:57,317
How long ago were they buried?

288
00:21:57,851 --> 00:22:01,688
Going by the tests we conducted,
must be approximately 40 years.

289
00:22:03,891 --> 00:22:06,260
What will they do to these bones?

290
00:22:07,027 --> 00:22:09,463
Government will arrange
for a proper burial.

291
00:22:13,066 --> 00:22:15,169
You've buried all the bones in one pit?

292
00:22:15,903 --> 00:22:18,772
Government has sanctioned money
for only one pit, sir.

293
00:22:20,874 --> 00:22:22,242
I've finished, sir.

294
00:22:22,309 --> 00:22:24,378
Must inscribe the names
of the deceased in the tomb.

295
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:25,979
Do you know their names?

296
00:22:27,614 --> 00:22:28,749
Not yet.

297
00:22:29,149 --> 00:22:30,884
-I'll let you know soon.
-Okay.

298
00:22:30,951 --> 00:22:32,152
I'll take your leave, sir.

299
00:22:41,061 --> 00:22:42,162
Got all the papers?

300
00:22:42,229 --> 00:22:44,031
-Sir...
-Hey! Check him.

301
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:47,668
Documents are at home, sir.

302
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:50,971
Sir, are you still obsessing
about those skulls?

303
00:22:51,471 --> 00:22:53,440
I'm unable to wipe that case
off my mind.

304
00:22:53,507 --> 00:22:55,709
What are you saying, sir?

305
00:22:55,776 --> 00:22:57,277
-Hey! Go, go.
-Some years ago

306
00:22:57,344 --> 00:22:58,779
there was a lake nearby,

307
00:22:58,846 --> 00:23:01,515
so many corpses were found
on the banks of the lake, sir.

308
00:23:03,016 --> 00:23:04,518
Do you know which year?

309
00:23:04,885 --> 00:23:07,087
Sir, this is buying trouble.

310
00:23:07,487 --> 00:23:09,590
We should not interfere
in Crime department matters, sir.

311
00:23:09,656 --> 00:23:10,858
Listen, Constable.

312
00:23:10,924 --> 00:23:13,794
Police department does not
differentiate traffic or crime.

313
00:23:13,861 --> 00:23:16,196
If we witness a crime
right in front of us,

314
00:23:16,263 --> 00:23:17,631
we should question it

315
00:23:17,698 --> 00:23:19,266
which department is not important.

316
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:20,868
Just tell me which year.

317
00:23:22,336 --> 00:23:24,805
Between 1975 to 1980, sir.

318
00:23:24,872 --> 00:23:27,040
That's when high-raise buildings
were constructed.

319
00:23:27,107 --> 00:23:28,909
You know where the case files
regarding that are stored?

320
00:23:29,243 --> 00:23:30,911
Yes, sir.

321
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,889
Take your time
and look through these files, sir.

322
00:23:42,122 --> 00:23:48,128
-Sir, the files you asked for are all here.-A strange path unknown unfolds before me

323
00:23:48,996 --> 00:23:52,165
The journey stretches ahead endlessly

324
00:23:52,232 --> 00:23:58,238
A secret hunt continues in a flurry

325
00:23:59,139 --> 00:24:02,409
Here and now, pit your wits, hurry

326
00:24:02,476 --> 00:24:04,711
He will be a carbon copy of you

327
00:24:04,778 --> 00:24:07,247
He will follow you like a shadow

328
00:24:07,347 --> 00:24:09,883
He will smile at you like a friend duly

329
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,885
Day in and day out, daily

330
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:17,424
He will lay a booby trap behind you
He will split your skull into two

331
00:24:17,491 --> 00:24:20,861
Man with a mask who can deceive you

332
00:24:20,928 --> 00:24:25,332
Master of disguise

333
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:30,070
A false face personifies

334
00:24:42,716 --> 00:24:48,722
To track and trail an unknown identity

335
00:24:49,623 --> 00:24:52,826
Heart stumbles in waves of uncertainty

336
00:24:52,893 --> 00:24:58,899
Like a wolf lurking
In sheep's clothing

337
00:24:59,733 --> 00:25:02,836
Deceit will play even within you irking

338
00:25:02,903 --> 00:25:07,875
In a world full of lies unleashed
Law and justice on the roads trashed

339
00:25:07,941 --> 00:25:12,880
Truth like a pair of dice poised
Will swirl and twirl daily unvoiced

340
00:25:12,946 --> 00:25:17,985
Eyes will be blinded by conspiracy
Selfishness will gain supremacy

341
00:25:18,051 --> 00:25:21,421
Like Buddha, calm on the exterior
He is Hyde hidden in the interior

342
00:25:21,488 --> 00:25:25,259
Man of disguise

343
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:26,527
Sir.

344
00:25:26,593 --> 00:25:29,263
-Master of deceit and duplicity...
-Sir. Sir!

345
00:25:29,863 --> 00:25:30,931
Tea, sir.

346
00:25:44,745 --> 00:25:49,449
Perceptive and hawk-eyed

347
00:25:49,583 --> 00:25:54,821
He will casually go past this side

348
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:59,626
Concentration will go
Out of the window

349
00:25:59,927 --> 00:26:04,498
He is one who buries underground
Strategies never to be found

350
00:26:04,565 --> 00:26:08,936
Masquerader with a pen name

351
00:26:09,102 --> 00:26:13,807
Charade is the name of his game

352
00:26:15,976 --> 00:26:18,946
Smoke-screen veil to fame

353
00:26:24,017 --> 00:26:26,920
-Will Kumar be late?
-He should be home anytime now.

354
00:26:29,156 --> 00:26:31,592
If my dad has borrowed
any money from you,

355
00:26:32,192 --> 00:26:33,193
I will repay you.

356
00:26:33,627 --> 00:26:35,095
No. Nothing of that sort.

357
00:26:35,195 --> 00:26:37,097
I have some work with him.
You relax.

358
00:26:37,164 --> 00:26:39,299
As if his turnover is five billion!

359
00:26:39,633 --> 00:26:40,701
What arrogance!

360
00:26:41,535 --> 00:26:43,604
Don't buy anything
from this fraud Raja's shop.

361
00:26:43,704 --> 00:26:45,839
He says he will deliver
the items only if I pay!

362
00:26:45,906 --> 00:26:49,109
Of course, he will ask.
Who will give freebies?

363
00:26:49,376 --> 00:26:50,944
What did you do with
the money I gave you, Dad?

364
00:26:52,312 --> 00:26:54,281
They went on foot
as pilgrimage to Tirupati,

365
00:26:54,348 --> 00:26:56,316
I gave it as my offering
in the temple donation box.

366
00:26:56,383 --> 00:26:58,185
-You'll never reform!
-Sir, huh?

367
00:26:59,186 --> 00:27:00,787
-When did you come?
-Just now.

368
00:27:01,622 --> 00:27:04,358
Make a cup of coffee
for me too, dear.

369
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:07,895
-Tell me, sir.
-In the year 1977,

370
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:09,229
a police inspector by name Ranjan

371
00:27:09,296 --> 00:27:11,031
was assigned
in M5 police station in Ennore.

372
00:27:11,098 --> 00:27:13,534
-Have you heard of him?
-Ranjan...

373
00:27:16,336 --> 00:27:17,971
Not that I remember.

374
00:27:19,106 --> 00:27:20,774
Shall I ask around in the department?

375
00:27:22,009 --> 00:27:23,744
It's okay, I'll find out.

376
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,948
That Ranjan seems a mystery cop.

377
00:27:28,015 --> 00:27:30,417
But if I can get my hands on
his investigation report,

378
00:27:30,484 --> 00:27:33,887
I can find out for sure
the motive behind the three murders.

379
00:27:33,954 --> 00:27:36,924
February 25th, 1977,

380
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,393
that morning a complaint was filed

381
00:27:39,459 --> 00:27:42,796
about a murder and theft
in the archaeological department.

382
00:27:42,863 --> 00:27:44,898
Murdered victim was Sampath.

383
00:27:45,065 --> 00:27:46,600
Age 32.

384
00:27:47,367 --> 00:27:48,468
First step in our investigation

385
00:27:48,535 --> 00:27:52,906
-was the items stolen from the locker.
-Hello. Yes.

386
00:27:53,373 --> 00:27:54,441
This is Ganapathy speaking.

387
00:27:54,808 --> 00:27:57,477
Tada Division head,
Chittoor head office,

388
00:27:57,544 --> 00:27:59,346
the boss of Suresh who went missing.

389
00:27:59,746 --> 00:28:01,481
During the Tada site excavation,

390
00:28:01,582 --> 00:28:04,852
many treasures were found
dating back to the Vijayanagara dynasty.

391
00:28:06,486 --> 00:28:10,290
Jewelry worth almost
eight to nine million

392
00:28:10,557 --> 00:28:13,460
requesting a transfer of the treasures
to Madras head office

393
00:28:13,527 --> 00:28:14,528
I passed an order.

394
00:28:14,695 --> 00:28:17,731
Suresh said the situation
is not conducive here

395
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:19,967
so he wanted two days' time.

396
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:21,301
[Ranjan] What was so wrong
with the situation?

397
00:28:22,035 --> 00:28:24,238
Some political agitation is rampant,

398
00:28:25,172 --> 00:28:26,974
there are riots all over the place

399
00:28:27,374 --> 00:28:30,143
so he said
he would send it two days later.

400
00:28:30,577 --> 00:28:32,913
Now what's weird is,
he himself is missing.

401
00:28:33,981 --> 00:28:37,718
[Ranjan] Sampath's body
was first found by office peon Sebastian.

402
00:28:37,784 --> 00:28:40,254
I have been working
with Sampath sir for ten years.

403
00:28:40,554 --> 00:28:43,156
I reach our office
daily by 8:00 a.m., sir.

404
00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:45,826
On that day too I came at 8:00 sharp.

405
00:28:48,395 --> 00:28:49,663
Ah! Oh God!

406
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:51,498
Murder... Murder!

407
00:28:52,132 --> 00:28:53,834
My stomach somersaulted, sir.

408
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:55,569
If I think of that pool of blood,

409
00:28:56,069 --> 00:28:57,938
I can't sleep even now, sir.

410
00:28:58,305 --> 00:29:01,742
[Ranjan] Sampath was killed
with a sharp weapon.

411
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:05,846
At the same time, a knife usually
fixed on the office wall was missing.

412
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,648
My name is Surendhar, sir.

413
00:29:07,714 --> 00:29:10,250
I am working for the past 15 years
in the Department of Archaeology, sir.

414
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:13,453
Only Sampath sir has the key
to our department's locker.

415
00:29:13,554 --> 00:29:14,955
No one else can lay hands on it.

416
00:29:18,125 --> 00:29:22,029
Whatever treasures we find will be
under his safe custody after testing.

417
00:29:25,032 --> 00:29:27,100
[Ranjan] At a distance of
30 km from Madras,

418
00:29:27,167 --> 00:29:28,268
near Ennore,

419
00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:31,305
a car was burnt down and abandoned.

420
00:29:34,141 --> 00:29:39,613
We later found it belonged to Suresh
working in the same department.

421
00:29:39,913 --> 00:29:43,116
But there was
no information about Suresh.

422
00:29:43,183 --> 00:29:46,787
As far as this case was concerned,
that car was an important evidence.

423
00:29:46,854 --> 00:29:52,626
Because the missing knife was also found
in that burnt car belonging to Suresh.

424
00:29:52,693 --> 00:29:54,661
Since Suresh was not around
for the enquiry,

425
00:29:54,995 --> 00:29:56,830
we interrogated his servants.

426
00:29:57,297 --> 00:29:59,900
Shanthi, a cook in Suresh's house.

427
00:29:59,967 --> 00:30:03,570
I have been cooking for sir
for the past five years.

428
00:30:03,904 --> 00:30:07,174
I served him coffee at 6:00 a.m. sharp.

429
00:30:08,642 --> 00:30:10,177
Sir. Sir.

430
00:30:13,247 --> 00:30:15,349
I came an hour later,

431
00:30:15,649 --> 00:30:17,584
the coffee was untouched.

432
00:30:17,651 --> 00:30:19,319
The door was locked too.

433
00:30:19,586 --> 00:30:22,322
Thinking that sir must have gone out
before daybreak somewhere,

434
00:30:22,389 --> 00:30:25,058
I went to ask Rayadu the servant.

435
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:26,326
I am Rayadu, sir.

436
00:30:26,426 --> 00:30:30,130
Shanthi ma'am referred me
to this place.

437
00:30:30,197 --> 00:30:31,899
[mobile ringing]

438
00:30:37,871 --> 00:30:39,439
-Hello?
-Sir, Kumar speaking.

439
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,008
What is the matter?

440
00:30:41,708 --> 00:30:42,576
Nothing, sir.

441
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:45,279
When I saw how interested
you are in this case,

442
00:30:45,913 --> 00:30:47,514
I have decided to help you.

443
00:30:48,148 --> 00:30:50,817
Whatever information I get,
I will pass on to you.

444
00:30:51,785 --> 00:30:54,655
It is up to you to give me
the cover story or not.

445
00:30:55,055 --> 00:30:55,989
Forget that.

446
00:30:56,223 --> 00:30:59,026
I'll help you to trace that inspector.

447
00:31:00,027 --> 00:31:00,861
Thanks.

448
00:31:05,866 --> 00:31:07,434
We went into his room,

449
00:31:07,835 --> 00:31:10,370
his wardrobe was open and empty
without any sign of his clothes.

450
00:31:10,437 --> 00:31:13,073
Thinking that he must have gone
on some assignment,

451
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,808
we got back to work.

452
00:31:15,576 --> 00:31:16,410
Yes, sir.

453
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:21,148
I remembered, madam asked me to keep
her suitcase in the room the previous day.

454
00:31:22,749 --> 00:31:25,152
-Rayadu.
-Coming, madam.

455
00:31:25,752 --> 00:31:27,955
Sir will come home late,
you go and sleep.

456
00:31:28,021 --> 00:31:28,989
Okay, madam.

457
00:31:29,056 --> 00:31:31,491
Keep my suitcase in my room.

458
00:31:31,925 --> 00:31:34,027
-I have to pack...
-[Ranjan] Previous day, Suresh's wife

459
00:31:34,094 --> 00:31:36,663
had said she was going
out of town the next day.

460
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:39,833
Mysteriously, that night
the whole family went missing.

461
00:31:40,367 --> 00:31:41,568
Something fishy.

462
00:31:42,369 --> 00:31:45,005
They have planned a trip
out of town after a murder

463
00:31:45,072 --> 00:31:48,375
Is this mere coincidence
or well-planned act?

464
00:31:48,809 --> 00:31:52,946
I continued my interrogation
as to why Suresh's family left town.

465
00:31:53,013 --> 00:31:55,249
I started enquiring
people in his inner circle.

466
00:31:55,315 --> 00:31:56,483
My name is Mahadevan.

467
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,018
Suresh is my neighbor.

468
00:31:58,352 --> 00:32:00,754
He held an account
in the same bank I was working.

469
00:32:00,821 --> 00:32:03,724
Suddenly, 2-3 days earlier,
he closed his account

470
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:04,992
and withdrew the entire amount.

471
00:32:05,526 --> 00:32:06,593
[Ranjan] Kasi.

472
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,761
Suresh's gardener.

473
00:32:08,128 --> 00:32:10,931
What were you doing the previous night
when your boss went missing?

474
00:32:11,231 --> 00:32:14,301
Sebastian visited us that night, sir.

475
00:32:15,936 --> 00:32:18,572
But I left for home
at 9 o'clock that night, sir.

476
00:32:18,906 --> 00:32:21,175
What he said was true, sir.

477
00:32:21,275 --> 00:32:23,777
After he left I got drunk too, sir.

478
00:32:23,844 --> 00:32:25,712
Sir, I forgot to tell you something.

479
00:32:26,146 --> 00:32:29,049
Suresh sir had asked me
to come to his chamber, sir.

480
00:32:29,716 --> 00:32:30,851
-Sebastian.
-Sir?

481
00:32:31,251 --> 00:32:33,120
-Some political agitation it seems.
-Okay, sir.

482
00:32:33,187 --> 00:32:35,022
-Lock down has been enforced.
-Okay, sir.

483
00:32:35,222 --> 00:32:36,890
-Sampath will be with me.
-Okay, sir.

484
00:32:37,224 --> 00:32:38,859
-All of you go home soon.
-Okay, sir.

485
00:32:39,226 --> 00:32:42,162
-I'll go with Sampath after we finish work
-Okay, sir.

486
00:32:42,629 --> 00:32:44,798
There was a huge agitation outside, sir.

487
00:32:45,132 --> 00:32:49,636
That's why I thought may maybeSuresh sir sent us earlier than usual.

488
00:32:49,703 --> 00:32:50,971
Sir, my name is Fernandez.

489
00:32:51,171 --> 00:32:53,407
I've been his driver
for the past 5-6 years.

490
00:32:54,308 --> 00:32:56,476
But that night I wasn't on duty.

491
00:32:57,177 --> 00:33:00,647
No one was in the office
other than Suresh sir and Sampath sir.

492
00:33:01,014 --> 00:33:02,549
-Fernandez!
-Sir?

493
00:33:02,616 --> 00:33:04,618
I will be a little late,
you can go home.

494
00:33:04,685 --> 00:33:06,153
It's okay, sir.
I will wait.

495
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,255
It's alright.
You go home.

496
00:33:09,056 --> 00:33:10,057
Okay, sir.

497
00:33:10,157 --> 00:33:13,727
I went home straight
because of the riot outside.

498
00:33:13,827 --> 00:33:16,530
[Ranjan] Suresh's security guard Mohan.

499
00:33:16,897 --> 00:33:20,467
That night as usual,
sir came home in his car.

500
00:33:20,701 --> 00:33:23,437
But what was unusual
instead of Fernandez,

501
00:33:23,504 --> 00:33:24,938
my boss was driving the car himself.

502
00:33:25,405 --> 00:33:28,108
Even in that split second, I noticed

503
00:33:28,175 --> 00:33:30,611
the blood stains on his shirt.

504
00:33:42,022 --> 00:33:45,559
Before I could ask him what happened,
he went in and shut the door.

505
00:33:50,964 --> 00:33:53,734
I went back to my post
thinking it is none of my business.

506
00:33:55,903 --> 00:33:57,171
The night was still and silent.

507
00:33:57,738 --> 00:34:01,041
Suddenly in an hour, the lights flickered.

508
00:34:01,275 --> 00:34:02,943
Then there was a total power outage.

509
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:06,747
Sir?

510
00:34:07,381 --> 00:34:08,215
Sir?

511
00:34:08,549 --> 00:34:10,050
[groaning in pain]

512
00:34:11,285 --> 00:34:12,753
I don't know who hit me, sir.

513
00:34:13,453 --> 00:34:15,189
That's all I know, sir.

514
00:34:15,255 --> 00:34:20,794
But I think maybe Suresh sir
had a partner.

515
00:34:21,128 --> 00:34:24,932
That man, Suresh sir and his wife

516
00:34:25,232 --> 00:34:27,367
must have joined hands
to commit this crime.

517
00:34:29,636 --> 00:34:33,006
Witness accounts, especially
oral statement by the security guard,

518
00:34:33,073 --> 00:34:34,842
taking all these into account,

519
00:34:34,908 --> 00:34:37,544
husband and wife must have
been the murderers for sure.

520
00:34:38,412 --> 00:34:40,047
Don't know if it was their greed,

521
00:34:40,113 --> 00:34:42,115
or someone else's conspiracy.

522
00:34:42,549 --> 00:34:45,452
But the sacrificial lamb
was the innocent child.

523
00:34:54,127 --> 00:34:57,264
May 27th, 1985.

524
00:34:57,564 --> 00:34:59,600
Due to the finding of
an important evidence

525
00:34:59,666 --> 00:35:02,769
I request you to reopen this case.

526
00:35:03,237 --> 00:35:06,340
From, Ranjan
Investigating officer.

527
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:16,149
Suresh and his wife Viji's greed

528
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:18,051
or another man's scheming

529
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:20,387
must have been the reason
for Sampath's murder,

530
00:35:20,454 --> 00:35:22,289
and the death of
Suresh's daughter Vaidehi.

531
00:35:26,593 --> 00:35:31,031
Definitely an associate of Suresh
must have been the murderer.

532
00:35:32,065 --> 00:35:35,802
One of those interrogated
has lied in the oral statements.

533
00:35:39,339 --> 00:35:43,076
Who is more avaricious than Suresh?

534
00:35:54,988 --> 00:35:56,156
-Hello, Shiva.-Yes, Shakthi.

535
00:35:56,223 --> 00:35:57,691
In 1977,

536
00:35:57,791 --> 00:36:00,627
in M5 police station, there was
an Inspector by name Ranjan.

537
00:36:01,295 --> 00:36:02,563
I need details about him.

538
00:36:02,863 --> 00:36:03,897
-Okay.
-Thanks.

539
00:36:04,264 --> 00:36:06,366
Don't stop.
Keep going.

540
00:36:06,433 --> 00:36:08,602
-Hey! Stop, stop.
-Show me your license.

541
00:36:08,669 --> 00:36:10,938
Riding a bike without a helmet.
Go and meet sir.

542
00:36:11,004 --> 00:36:12,139
-Stop!
-Please, sir.

543
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,209
Thank you, sir.

544
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,948
-Hello?
-Shakthi.

545
00:36:21,014 --> 00:36:22,916
-You asked for Ranjan's details, right?
-Yes.

546
00:36:22,983 --> 00:36:25,419
It has been 35 years since
he retired from service.

547
00:36:25,652 --> 00:36:27,454
His name isn't mentioned
even in the pension list.

548
00:36:27,955 --> 00:36:31,258
I have texted via WhatsApp
his old department ID card.

549
00:36:31,692 --> 00:36:32,793
Okay, thank you.

550
00:36:35,062 --> 00:36:36,630
Are you deaf or what?

551
00:36:36,697 --> 00:36:38,265
Just send him.
Don't make a fuss.

552
00:36:40,634 --> 00:36:41,969
Hey! Stop.

553
00:36:42,035 --> 00:36:43,170
I said stop.

554
00:36:43,237 --> 00:36:44,905
Go, show him your papers.

555
00:36:46,507 --> 00:36:49,042
What, sir? Watching a film
in Tamil Rockers, huh?

556
00:36:50,177 --> 00:36:51,578
Have you seen him anywhere?

557
00:36:53,947 --> 00:36:54,648
This man?

558
00:36:55,148 --> 00:36:56,416
He is that drunken monk, sir.

559
00:36:56,817 --> 00:36:57,885
What are you blabbering?

560
00:36:57,951 --> 00:36:59,987
He was the one
who blabbered, sir, not me.

561
00:37:00,754 --> 00:37:01,889
We caught him in Guindy.

562
00:37:02,723 --> 00:37:03,790
Totally tanked.

563
00:37:04,124 --> 00:37:07,461
He asked 40 times,
"Do you know who I am?"

564
00:37:07,528 --> 00:37:09,763
-That old Fiat car.
-Exactly, sir.

565
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:11,832
His address must be
on the charge sheet?

566
00:37:11,899 --> 00:37:13,133
-Yes, sir.
-First find that.

567
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:35,455
Sir.

568
00:37:36,557 --> 00:37:37,724
Is anyone home?

569
00:37:38,792 --> 00:37:39,660
Hello, sir?

570
00:37:41,428 --> 00:37:42,596
Sir, anyone in there?

571
00:38:28,775 --> 00:38:30,644
Who the hell are you, man?

572
00:38:31,845 --> 00:38:33,113
Is this your first robbery?

573
00:38:51,832 --> 00:38:52,933
Are you mad or what?

574
00:38:53,767 --> 00:38:55,369
I would have been dead
if you hadn't missed.

575
00:38:57,371 --> 00:39:00,274
You think now I can't
close your chapter, huh?

576
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:03,944
What the hell were you
doing in my garden?

577
00:39:04,778 --> 00:39:06,380
Sir, my name is Shakthi.

578
00:39:06,547 --> 00:39:08,048
You can be Shakthi
or Shiva for all I care.

579
00:39:09,116 --> 00:39:11,084
Reply only to the questions I ask you.

580
00:39:13,453 --> 00:39:19,059
Sir, in 1977, a man called Suresh stole
from the archaeological department,

581
00:39:19,126 --> 00:39:21,128
murdered his colleague Sampath.

582
00:39:21,495 --> 00:39:24,431
And went into hiding with his family
I read the report filed by you.

583
00:39:25,332 --> 00:39:29,169
I read the case file and found out
you investigated this case.

584
00:39:30,204 --> 00:39:31,205
Sir,

585
00:39:31,705 --> 00:39:33,340
the family that went missing

586
00:39:34,074 --> 00:39:35,542
has been found, sir.

587
00:39:36,076 --> 00:39:39,213
While digging for Metro work
some bones were unearthed.

588
00:39:39,513 --> 00:39:42,349
I have a strong suspicion
it may be Suresh and his family, sir.

589
00:39:43,116 --> 00:39:46,320
Sir, after you closed that case
nearly eight years later

590
00:39:46,386 --> 00:39:51,058
that is May 27th, 1985
you found some new evidence, sir.

591
00:39:51,124 --> 00:39:54,862
It was only after that
you wanted the case reopened.

592
00:39:55,062 --> 00:39:59,199
What was so important an evidence
you found on that date, sir?

593
00:39:59,633 --> 00:40:01,902
I couldn't find anything
in the case file either.

594
00:40:02,102 --> 00:40:05,005
And because we don't have
any DNA samples from that family

595
00:40:05,072 --> 00:40:06,740
we couldn't match
and confirm it positively.

596
00:40:07,674 --> 00:40:11,345
To confirm if the bones unearthed
are in fact those family members,

597
00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:13,514
if we get any lead from you,
it will be of great help.

598
00:40:13,914 --> 00:40:15,649
So, please, sir.

599
00:40:25,025 --> 00:40:26,994
I'm not obligated to tell you anything.

600
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,399
-Out!
-Please, sir.

601
00:40:32,466 --> 00:40:34,268
Don't refuse, sir.
Kindly help me in this case.

602
00:40:34,334 --> 00:40:35,502
Please, sir.

603
00:40:36,036 --> 00:40:37,271
Sir, one minute.

604
00:40:37,337 --> 00:40:39,072
Listen to me, please, sir.

605
00:40:39,139 --> 00:40:42,643
Sir, I think one more person may be
involved in this case besides Suresh.

606
00:40:42,709 --> 00:40:44,311
Give me just one hint
who that can be, sir.

607
00:40:44,378 --> 00:40:46,446
Sir, no one is bothered about this case.

608
00:40:46,513 --> 00:40:47,748
I am an ordinary Traffic police.

609
00:40:47,814 --> 00:40:50,651
I work during the day
and I investigate this case at night.

610
00:40:50,851 --> 00:40:54,621
You have investigated this case.
That's why I'm asking you for help, sir.

611
00:40:54,688 --> 00:40:56,490
Details of the bones we got now,

612
00:40:56,557 --> 00:40:58,992
forensic report,
everything is in this file.

613
00:40:59,059 --> 00:41:01,495
I'll be grateful if you can see it
when you are sober.

614
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,431
Okay, sir.

615
00:41:05,098 --> 00:41:05,766
Okay.

616
00:41:51,645 --> 00:41:56,183
My sore eyes bloom
In my dream to blossom

617
00:41:56,650 --> 00:42:00,921
My dreams crawl in delight
Child-like in your lap at night

618
00:42:01,889 --> 00:42:06,226
A new journey unfolds ahead of me

619
00:42:06,493 --> 00:42:11,098
Petals of my life every day wither sadly

620
00:42:11,164 --> 00:42:17,171
Every night I lie on our sheet, dear
With fond memories of you right here

621
00:42:17,337 --> 00:42:21,542
O' girl, I wane in every sense
Because of your absence

622
00:42:21,608 --> 00:42:27,447
In my doorway unmistaken
I inhale your scent often

623
00:42:27,514 --> 00:42:32,252
In my breath I always see
Your face greeting me happily

624
00:42:32,786 --> 00:42:37,824
My tired eyes bloom
In my dream to blossom

625
00:42:37,891 --> 00:42:42,296
My dreams crawl in delight
Child-like in your lap at night

626
00:42:43,063 --> 00:42:47,467
A new journey unfolds ahead of me

627
00:42:47,868 --> 00:42:52,339
Petals of my life every day wither sadly

628
00:42:52,406 --> 00:42:58,378
Every night I lie on our sheet, dear
With fond memories of you right here

629
00:42:58,445 --> 00:43:02,783
O' girl, I wane in every sense
Because of your absence

630
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:08,522
In my doorway unmistaken
I inhale your scent often

631
00:43:08,589 --> 00:43:13,293
In my breath I always see
Your face smiling at me

632
00:43:20,701 --> 00:43:22,269
[whistling]

633
00:43:34,381 --> 00:43:39,353
As dawn slips to dusk clock ticks as well
Night slithers into its deepest shell

634
00:43:39,419 --> 00:43:44,391
Where do I fit into this hell?

635
00:43:44,691 --> 00:43:49,930
Seconds as hands of thorn now
Prick my soul's innermost alcove

636
00:43:49,997 --> 00:43:54,334
Is pain a pleasure somehow?

637
00:43:55,102 --> 00:43:59,706
I realized it is a battlefield

638
00:43:59,773 --> 00:44:05,245
But I forgot to fight or wield a shield

639
00:44:05,312 --> 00:44:11,318
Don't try to bloom with your scented sari
In my desert-heart that beats an elegy

640
00:44:13,687 --> 00:44:15,689
Because of you, my dream--

641
00:44:17,991 --> 00:44:20,093
What kind of life am I leading, O' God!

642
00:44:24,631 --> 00:44:25,899
Stop right there.

643
00:44:27,267 --> 00:44:29,570
If you set foot in this direction
once more,

644
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:33,473
then there won't be any difference
between the skulls you found and you!

645
00:44:39,179 --> 00:44:39,880
Shoot.

646
00:44:41,982 --> 00:44:42,683
Pull the trigger.

647
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:47,421
You are spoken very highly of
in our department.

648
00:44:49,556 --> 00:44:52,960
But now it is evident
there's no chance it is you!

649
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:55,562
To lead a life like this today

650
00:44:55,629 --> 00:44:57,297
you should be ashamed, sir.

651
00:44:58,465 --> 00:45:00,100
Being addicted to alcohol,

652
00:45:00,167 --> 00:45:02,469
you are leading a coward's life.

653
00:45:03,337 --> 00:45:05,739
Leaving the case you took up unfinished,

654
00:45:06,106 --> 00:45:08,642
just because your family died
being the only reason,

655
00:45:08,709 --> 00:45:11,011
how is it fair on your part
to leave it halfway, sir?

656
00:45:12,913 --> 00:45:16,517
Who will ensure justice
to an anonymous family, sir?

657
00:45:21,188 --> 00:45:22,189
Poor child!

658
00:45:22,256 --> 00:45:24,691
They didn't even spare that young girl.

659
00:45:25,259 --> 00:45:27,060
My anger erupted
only because of that, sir.

660
00:45:27,127 --> 00:45:28,562
I took up this case.

661
00:45:29,463 --> 00:45:33,300
But you are least bothered, right?

662
00:45:34,768 --> 00:45:37,571
Go and get sloshed somewhere
and sprawl down senseless.

663
00:45:38,472 --> 00:45:40,140
I won't set foot anywhere near you.

664
00:45:43,544 --> 00:45:45,946
To think I jumped over this wall
respecting this man.

665
00:45:46,013 --> 00:45:47,748
I need to slipper my brains!

666
00:45:50,951 --> 00:45:56,123
Eyes of the wind wept grief-stricken
Looking for wings to sweep unbidden

667
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:57,724
Was that rain in depression?

668
00:45:58,692 --> 00:46:01,795
Police officers like you
have no retirement.

669
00:46:02,629 --> 00:46:06,533
I have lost everything I had.

670
00:46:08,135 --> 00:46:09,970
I don't know why I'm alive.

671
00:46:10,304 --> 00:46:14,074
Maybe you are here to wind up
this case for all you know.

672
00:46:14,141 --> 00:46:17,477
By investigating a case
where a man died 40 years ago...

673
00:46:19,947 --> 00:46:21,515
...what will I achieve now?

674
00:46:21,915 --> 00:46:23,717
We died 30 years ago.

675
00:46:24,084 --> 00:46:26,587
Have you stopped thinking about us?

676
00:46:27,554 --> 00:46:32,459
Some random youngster has taken up
this case and is struggling with it.

677
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:35,529
This is your case.

678
00:46:37,231 --> 00:46:39,766
Only to finish what you start
is my Ranjan's style.

679
00:46:57,885 --> 00:47:00,888
Sir, look who has come.

680
00:47:10,097 --> 00:47:11,131
Sir?

681
00:47:11,632 --> 00:47:12,633
Oh!

682
00:47:17,604 --> 00:47:21,475
A sincere police officer
can sleep fitfully

683
00:47:22,075 --> 00:47:23,944
only if he solves his half-finished case.

684
00:47:24,611 --> 00:47:26,580
But all the cases
can't be closed so easily.

685
00:47:27,514 --> 00:47:30,417
Some cases possess us
like spirits and give us grief.

686
00:47:31,084 --> 00:47:32,219
Like this one.

687
00:47:34,388 --> 00:47:36,823
It was Emergency period then.

688
00:47:38,358 --> 00:47:39,693
The nation was engulfed in darkness.

689
00:47:41,428 --> 00:47:42,796
Like this Covid-19 now.

690
00:47:42,863 --> 00:47:44,031
You are so experienced, sir.

691
00:47:45,232 --> 00:47:48,502
On that day too, I stood
in this same spot.

692
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:52,806
This case had got hold of me
like a monitor lizard.

693
00:47:55,108 --> 00:47:56,977
I had left no stone unturned
in looking for Suresh.

694
00:47:57,845 --> 00:48:00,914
Why did you think of
reopening this case, sir?

695
00:48:01,114 --> 00:48:02,082
You know very well.

696
00:48:02,783 --> 00:48:04,785
When we are investigating a case,

697
00:48:05,285 --> 00:48:09,089
and if we suspect someone,
whatever they do will seem wrong.

698
00:48:10,624 --> 00:48:11,925
I did the same mistake.

699
00:48:13,026 --> 00:48:13,861
I shouldn't have.

700
00:48:14,261 --> 00:48:16,964
What are you saying?
Then Suresh isn't the culprit?

701
00:48:18,632 --> 00:48:21,068
According to my analysis,
Suresh is innocent.

702
00:48:22,102 --> 00:48:25,239
With the situation then and
the leads and evidences we got,

703
00:48:25,305 --> 00:48:27,975
we were forced to
believe he was the culprit.

704
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:30,878
But the truth maybe,

705
00:48:31,645 --> 00:48:35,015
whoever killed Sampath
must have killed Suresh too.

706
00:48:36,717 --> 00:48:37,618
Poor man!

707
00:48:38,051 --> 00:48:39,419
Suresh wasn't escaping.

708
00:48:41,588 --> 00:48:45,692
They have buried his family and him
along with the truth down here.

709
00:48:46,226 --> 00:48:48,228
With the evidences I got then,

710
00:48:49,062 --> 00:48:50,631
this was all I could decipher.

711
00:48:51,098 --> 00:48:54,368
So you also think someone else
stole all the treasures?

712
00:48:56,103 --> 00:48:57,137
Yes.

713
00:48:57,204 --> 00:48:59,339
What was the new evidence you got, sir?

714
00:49:01,141 --> 00:49:02,409
Where are those case files?

715
00:49:04,711 --> 00:49:06,480
It isn't a new evidence.

716
00:49:07,414 --> 00:49:09,449
When we investigate a case,

717
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:13,020
our eyes should become blind
to the lies surrounding us.

718
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:15,355
Our hawk-eyes should focus
only on the truth,

719
00:49:15,856 --> 00:49:18,025
not lies that seem to resemble the truth.

720
00:49:18,825 --> 00:49:22,396
When I was inspecting
Suresh's house on that day,

721
00:49:22,462 --> 00:49:25,365
I found a prescription
that was slightly blood stained.

722
00:49:25,699 --> 00:49:28,802
But details about the doctor
was completely missing.

723
00:49:29,169 --> 00:49:31,972
So we couldn't reach him.

724
00:49:32,739 --> 00:49:36,009
Then how did you find out with
the handwriting on a prescription?

725
00:49:36,176 --> 00:49:40,647
Eight years after Suresh went missing,
while I was investigating some other case,

726
00:49:40,714 --> 00:49:44,384
I saw another medical prescription
in that same handwriting.

727
00:49:44,451 --> 00:49:46,720
That's how I found the doctor's address.

728
00:49:47,988 --> 00:49:49,289
Our assumption was wrong.

729
00:49:50,891 --> 00:49:52,659
Suresh did not kill Sampath.

730
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:55,195
He has saved someone's life!

731
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:04,404
Sir!

732
00:50:12,646 --> 00:50:13,714
Doctor?

733
00:50:16,316 --> 00:50:17,851
Get these medicines immediately.

734
00:50:22,289 --> 00:50:23,390
Good girl!

735
00:50:34,334 --> 00:50:35,702
[spluttering]

736
00:50:41,742 --> 00:50:42,809
Vaidehi.

737
00:50:43,277 --> 00:50:44,378
Vaidehi.

738
00:50:45,812 --> 00:50:46,780
Vaidehi.

739
00:51:27,688 --> 00:51:30,591
Sir, who do you think is behind all this?

740
00:51:30,691 --> 00:51:32,793
This happened 40 years ago.

741
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:34,628
I wonder if the thief bought an island,

742
00:51:34,695 --> 00:51:37,231
became a politician
or an underground don.

743
00:51:37,297 --> 00:51:39,533
I don't even know
if he is alive today.

744
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:42,302
If you can advise me on how
to go about this case, it will be use--

745
00:51:42,369 --> 00:51:43,470
Shakthi.

746
00:51:44,738 --> 00:51:46,673
I don't want to be
a policeman anymore.

747
00:51:47,941 --> 00:51:50,644
You are the one who wants
to shift from Traffic to Crime.

748
00:51:51,411 --> 00:51:54,114
Take this as an opportunity
and solve this case.

749
00:51:54,948 --> 00:51:56,650
The way he found that treasure,

750
00:51:57,951 --> 00:51:59,419
you will find him.

751
00:52:00,888 --> 00:52:02,155
All the best.

752
00:52:04,191 --> 00:52:06,059
[mobile ringing]

753
00:52:06,326 --> 00:52:07,461
-Hello.-Sir, it's me.

754
00:52:07,528 --> 00:52:10,264
I got an important lead
regarding our case.

755
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:12,266
-Can we meet, sir?
-Super!

756
00:52:12,332 --> 00:52:15,335
I am going to Minjur to provide security.
I'll meet you tomorrow evening.

757
00:52:15,435 --> 00:52:16,570
-Okay, sir.
-Thank you.

758
00:52:44,298 --> 00:52:47,267
Swathi, do you know where your dad is?

759
00:52:47,534 --> 00:52:49,269
I've been trying to
reach him for a long time.

760
00:52:49,336 --> 00:52:51,605
-His phone is switched off.
-He isn't at home.

761
00:52:51,705 --> 00:52:54,374
He went to his office yesterday.
He hasn't come back as yet.

762
00:52:56,009 --> 00:52:57,144
Why?

763
00:52:57,945 --> 00:52:59,112
Is there any problem?

764
00:52:59,179 --> 00:53:00,447
No, nothing of that sort.

765
00:53:00,514 --> 00:53:02,449
But why has he switched off his phone?

766
00:53:04,384 --> 00:53:08,555
Unable to face his creditors
sometimes he switches it off.

767
00:53:08,689 --> 00:53:11,124
Did you find any change in him recently?

768
00:53:12,125 --> 00:53:13,861
Specific change means...

769
00:53:14,461 --> 00:53:16,663
After you met him,

770
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:19,299
he has got a cover story
through you it seems.

771
00:53:19,366 --> 00:53:22,102
He said it will change
our life completely.

772
00:53:22,736 --> 00:53:24,304
Not only that,

773
00:53:24,371 --> 00:53:30,143
he has got a lead about actress Ramya.
He said he intends interviewing her.

774
00:53:30,444 --> 00:53:32,346
After a long time,
I saw in my dad,

775
00:53:32,412 --> 00:53:34,581
that old excitement
and rush of adrenalin.

776
00:53:35,549 --> 00:53:36,617
Okay.

777
00:53:36,817 --> 00:53:37,784
Thanks.

778
00:53:37,851 --> 00:53:39,786
If he calls you,
ask him to call me at once.

779
00:53:39,853 --> 00:53:42,389
-Sorry for disturbing you so late.
-It's okay.

780
00:53:42,456 --> 00:53:44,424
-See you.
-Bye.

781
00:53:46,527 --> 00:53:50,697
Cloaked by darkness

782
00:53:51,865 --> 00:53:56,103
This is the eclipse

783
00:53:57,137 --> 00:54:02,342
Wherein lies the answer

784
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:07,814
Till it is solved forever

785
00:54:08,148 --> 00:54:12,252
You are the crescent silver

786
00:54:12,986 --> 00:54:17,491
Even after it ends it will surely
Continue with all its glory

787
00:54:19,593 --> 00:54:21,562
A never ending story

788
00:54:21,628 --> 00:54:24,865
Hop up in this club with some models

789
00:54:25,065 --> 00:54:28,135
Sittin' vip poppin' bottles

790
00:54:28,235 --> 00:54:30,537
We ain't slowin' down
We full throttle

791
00:54:30,604 --> 00:54:33,707
We just do it big homie
We just so colossal

792
00:54:33,774 --> 00:54:35,609
You just bring it down baby, girl

793
00:54:35,709 --> 00:54:38,512
You know to work it
Bounce it to the sides

794
00:54:38,579 --> 00:54:40,280
And I love the way you twerk it

795
00:54:40,347 --> 00:54:43,317
Shake it &amp; you break it
Exotic like teriyaki

796
00:54:43,383 --> 00:54:44,618
Spin it disc jockey

797
00:54:44,685 --> 00:54:46,353
I'm dancin' with this hayaki

798
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:49,389
Hey cool customer dandy
Brow to toe explore me

799
00:54:49,456 --> 00:54:52,659
Ravish the rest of me
By sending me in a dizzy spree

800
00:54:52,726 --> 00:54:56,063
This golden lamp is for you
To rub and polish too

801
00:54:56,129 --> 00:54:59,366
For the genie to spring out true

802
00:54:59,433 --> 00:55:05,439
Come, crinkle curves of pleasure
To unearth my hidden treasure

803
00:55:05,906 --> 00:55:07,674
Cut, shot okay

804
00:55:07,741 --> 00:55:08,775
Excellent!

805
00:55:11,144 --> 00:55:12,646
-Shekar.
-Madam.

806
00:55:12,746 --> 00:55:14,882
-Get my charger.
-Okay, madam.

807
00:55:16,416 --> 00:55:17,417
Hello, ma'am.

808
00:55:18,652 --> 00:55:19,620
Who are you?

809
00:55:19,686 --> 00:55:21,121
Please wait outside. Shekar--

810
00:55:21,188 --> 00:55:22,356
Actually I'm not--

811
00:55:22,422 --> 00:55:23,924
Excuse me.
Get out!

812
00:55:23,991 --> 00:55:25,359
Hello, hello.
Excuse me.

813
00:55:25,425 --> 00:55:28,228
I'm not a junior artiste.
This isn't a rented costume either.

814
00:55:28,328 --> 00:55:29,796
I'm sub inspector Shakthi.

815
00:55:29,863 --> 00:55:31,665
I am here to enquire regarding a case.

816
00:55:31,732 --> 00:55:32,900
I'll wait outside.

817
00:55:38,071 --> 00:55:40,340
-Junior artistes, go there.
-Over there, sir?

818
00:55:40,707 --> 00:55:41,875
Field clear.

819
00:55:42,609 --> 00:55:43,677
-Sir?
-Move to the side.

820
00:55:43,744 --> 00:55:45,412
Madam wants to meet you.

821
00:55:48,415 --> 00:55:49,950
In our cinema world,

822
00:55:50,217 --> 00:55:52,019
everything is only make-believe.

823
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:55,389
We show things
that don't exist

824
00:55:56,857 --> 00:55:58,458
and make people believe.

825
00:55:59,226 --> 00:56:00,894
But in your profession,

826
00:56:01,728 --> 00:56:03,530
you don't trust even the truth

827
00:56:04,164 --> 00:56:05,432
and suspect everyone.

828
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:10,404
That's why I was rude to you
not realizing you're a real policeman.

829
00:56:11,371 --> 00:56:12,406
Go ahead.

830
00:56:12,806 --> 00:56:14,074
Ma'am, Lockup News is a--

831
00:56:14,141 --> 00:56:15,142
[knock on door]

832
00:56:16,176 --> 00:56:18,178
-Come in.
-Madam, shot ready.

833
00:56:21,114 --> 00:56:23,851
I'll act that scene and tell you
without putting on an act.

834
00:56:28,755 --> 00:56:30,324
Madam will be delayed it seems.

835
00:56:30,424 --> 00:56:32,125
Save your contact number
in this mobile.

836
00:56:32,192 --> 00:56:33,427
She will call you.

837
00:56:34,328 --> 00:56:35,028
Take it, sir.

838
00:56:38,098 --> 00:56:39,800
Hey, Bomma.

839
00:56:40,734 --> 00:56:42,336
Come, come.

840
00:56:43,971 --> 00:56:46,173
No one knows when he will come
and when he will vanish.

841
00:56:48,942 --> 00:56:52,045
What is that heroine's name?

842
00:56:52,145 --> 00:56:53,313
Ramya, sir.

843
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:54,715
Ramya?

844
00:56:57,017 --> 00:56:58,485
I don't rem--

845
00:56:59,086 --> 00:57:02,022
I didn't come across such a name
in my investigations.

846
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:05,659
How do you say there's a link
between Ramya and this case?

847
00:57:05,726 --> 00:57:09,196
Sir, that Editor Kumar had collected
some details about this case.

848
00:57:09,263 --> 00:57:10,664
Based on that lead, sir.

849
00:57:11,098 --> 00:57:15,169
If there are any personal files
related this case,

850
00:57:15,335 --> 00:57:16,603
can I take a look?

851
00:57:19,106 --> 00:57:20,207
Thank you, sir.

852
00:57:35,355 --> 00:57:36,790
[doorbell]

853
00:57:45,098 --> 00:57:46,233
8 o'clock.

854
00:57:46,667 --> 00:57:47,935
So punctual.

855
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:50,771
Are you always on time?

856
00:57:52,306 --> 00:57:54,408
Or was it a desire to meet this Ramya?

857
00:57:55,008 --> 00:57:57,945
You can take it any which way.
As long as I get what I want.

858
00:57:58,011 --> 00:57:59,513
All your problems will be resolved.

859
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:00,614
Come in.

860
00:58:11,091 --> 00:58:12,893
I expected you to be in your uniform.

861
00:58:14,461 --> 00:58:16,997
Do you know anyone by the name Suresh?

862
00:58:19,166 --> 00:58:21,869
Shakthi, the night is still young.

863
00:58:23,136 --> 00:58:24,371
Don't rush it.

864
00:58:24,738 --> 00:58:26,173
Let me get you a drink.

865
00:58:42,289 --> 00:58:43,957
Don't stare at the photos too much.

866
00:58:45,893 --> 00:58:47,528
Why don't you look at me?

867
00:58:49,196 --> 00:58:51,365
Mrs. Shakthi. Does she exist?

868
00:58:52,232 --> 00:58:53,267
No.

869
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:55,068
-Girlfriend?
-No.

870
00:58:55,569 --> 00:58:57,271
Actually, I don't care.

871
00:59:02,176 --> 00:59:03,343
Cheers!

872
00:59:12,486 --> 00:59:14,421
Do you know Suresh?

873
00:59:14,488 --> 00:59:17,524
Many years ago, he was working
in the archaeological department.

874
00:59:22,829 --> 00:59:24,364
In 1977...

875
00:59:25,732 --> 00:59:27,100
Sexy color, no?

876
00:59:28,101 --> 00:59:30,571
His family was murdered--

877
00:59:34,875 --> 00:59:36,643
You were saying something, right?

878
00:59:40,447 --> 00:59:41,515
It's very hot.

879
00:59:42,616 --> 00:59:43,917
Do you want some ice?

880
00:59:43,984 --> 00:59:45,385
I can get you some ice.

881
00:59:46,153 --> 00:59:47,221
Just wait.

882
01:00:11,144 --> 01:00:13,180
Questions to be asked will be tough.

883
01:00:13,247 --> 01:00:14,648
But don't stop, okay?

884
01:00:14,715 --> 01:00:15,716
Sure, sir.

885
01:00:15,983 --> 01:00:18,218
-Sir is asking you to talk like him--
-One second.

886
01:00:18,285 --> 01:00:19,386
Okay, fine.

887
01:00:19,553 --> 01:00:20,554
Sir.

888
01:00:20,954 --> 01:00:23,423
I called you so many times,
but you didn't pick my calls, sir.

889
01:00:23,490 --> 01:00:26,026
Yes! Why do you
keep trying if I don't pick your call?

890
01:00:26,093 --> 01:00:27,528
Aren't you ashamed?
Hang up now.

891
01:00:27,594 --> 01:00:29,496
Sir, sir.
Don't hang up, sir.

892
01:00:30,097 --> 01:00:34,201
I have Breaking News that can change
the Election results to be announced, sir.

893
01:00:34,501 --> 01:00:36,737
Please meet me at Inox basement, sir.

894
01:00:36,870 --> 01:00:39,072
Find some gullible idiot and tell him.

895
01:00:39,139 --> 01:00:42,843
I was forced to sit at home for two years
thanks to the wrong news you gave me.

896
01:00:42,910 --> 01:00:44,578
I don't want anything to do with you.

897
01:00:44,645 --> 01:00:46,980
Sir, you are right to feel that way.

898
01:00:47,414 --> 01:00:48,916
I blundered last time.

899
01:00:49,316 --> 01:00:52,219
Just meet me once, sir.
I'll tell you the whole story.

900
01:00:52,819 --> 01:00:54,688
Day and night
without even going home

901
01:00:54,755 --> 01:00:56,156
I have found this, sir.

902
01:00:56,223 --> 01:00:59,359
You can decide if you will use this
or not after you hear me out, sir.

903
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:00,727
Please, sir.

904
01:01:01,028 --> 01:01:03,764
Okay, this is the last time.
I'll see you there.

905
01:01:04,031 --> 01:01:05,365
Okay, thanks, sir.

906
01:01:07,534 --> 01:01:09,436
Hey! Stop, stop.

907
01:01:10,404 --> 01:01:12,639
Are you trying to cheat me
out of the money you owe me?

908
01:01:12,706 --> 01:01:15,075
-Today you're dead, man.
-Sir, two days--

909
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:17,644
Give me two days, sir.

910
01:01:18,212 --> 01:01:19,379
I'll pay you, sir

911
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:30,157
The number you are trying
to reach is currently switched off.

912
01:01:36,964 --> 01:01:39,333
Sorry, I disturbed you.

913
01:01:41,435 --> 01:01:44,171
The doctor has said he should be
under observation for 24 hours.

914
01:01:47,608 --> 01:01:49,576
Only after getting the scan reports,

915
01:01:51,979 --> 01:01:53,614
we will know if he'll make it or not.

916
01:01:53,847 --> 01:01:55,349
-Don't worry.
-Excuse me.

917
01:01:59,419 --> 01:02:01,088
He never listens to me.

918
01:02:02,022 --> 01:02:04,625
I tell him we can lead a good life with
what we have, but does he listen?

919
01:02:05,259 --> 01:02:08,996
He didn't let me accept an offer I got
from a renowned News channel.

920
01:02:09,796 --> 01:02:12,299
How long can I be right next to him?

921
01:02:13,333 --> 01:02:16,236
He is obsessed with
his damn press!

922
01:02:17,137 --> 01:02:20,807
I'm so mad I feel like burning down
that damn Press office.

923
01:02:20,874 --> 01:02:22,342
Hey! Don't say that.

924
01:02:22,409 --> 01:02:24,811
You were the inspiration
for him to start that press.

925
01:02:25,512 --> 01:02:27,781
Don't harbor these thoughts
and get upset unnecessarily.

926
01:02:28,515 --> 01:02:29,550
Be brave.

927
01:02:32,953 --> 01:02:35,189
Do you suspect anyone?

928
01:02:35,789 --> 01:02:38,492
He has borrowed money
left, right and center.

929
01:02:39,459 --> 01:02:43,463
On top of it, he never told me
about that mysterious cover story.

930
01:02:45,098 --> 01:02:47,301
Sorry for wasting your time.

931
01:02:47,367 --> 01:02:48,869
No, no! Not at all.

932
01:02:48,969 --> 01:02:52,172
Update me immediately as soon as
you hear from the doctor, okay?

933
01:02:52,973 --> 01:02:53,974
-Take care.
-Okay.

934
01:02:54,775 --> 01:02:56,443
Ajay, announce this 'Breaking News'.

935
01:02:56,510 --> 01:02:58,812
Sandy, come here.
You hold this.

936
01:02:59,646 --> 01:03:02,916
Get 30 seconds clippings and photos
of popular actress Ramya immediately.

937
01:03:02,983 --> 01:03:03,650
Okay, sir.

938
01:03:03,984 --> 01:03:06,787
Abhi, change Election News
to scrolling immediately.

939
01:03:09,223 --> 01:03:10,958
Type what I tell you.

940
01:03:11,024 --> 01:03:14,461
Most sought after actress Ramya
known for her tri-lingual films

941
01:03:14,528 --> 01:03:17,297
was shot dead early this morning
by a mysterious killer.

942
01:03:17,364 --> 01:03:20,033
With her proficient acting skill
and charismatic looks

943
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:25,105
she had a fan following
equal to heroes for more than 20 years.

944
01:03:25,172 --> 01:03:28,208
Photos of Ramya are rampant online now.

945
01:03:28,675 --> 01:03:31,278
Police are on a witch hunt
to find the killer.

946
01:03:31,345 --> 01:03:33,547
Our interview with
the Police commissioner.

947
01:03:33,614 --> 01:03:35,349
We have just started
the investigation.

948
01:03:35,415 --> 01:03:36,650
CCTV isn't working.

949
01:03:36,717 --> 01:03:39,887
So we have no clue about the killer
This is all I can impart now.

950
01:03:39,953 --> 01:03:42,789
Continue watching our News
for updates by the minute.

951
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,670
What were you doing
in Ramya's house at that time?

952
01:03:59,230 --> 01:04:00,100
I'm asking you, tell me.

953
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:07,140
Then, Inspector.
What else?

954
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:16,580
Don't try baiting me.

955
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:18,590
This is a murder investigation.

956
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:20,490
Not your film shoot.

957
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:24,830
Ten-year-old girl has been murdered too.

958
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:26,790
Help me if you can.

959
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:28,400
Otherwise, no problem.

960
01:04:29,130 --> 01:04:29,800
Goodnight.

961
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:35,340
Sir, I came and told you everything
without hiding anything from you.

962
01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:39,070
If you are still suspicious of my actions,
you can call me anytime for an inquiry.

963
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:41,540
I'm also from the department, sir.

964
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:43,280
I won't run away anywhere.

965
01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:45,080
Okay, you can go.
I'll call you.

966
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:47,410
If you get involved
in this case again,

967
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:48,980
I'll be forced to take
action against you.

968
01:04:50,550 --> 01:04:51,550
Sorry, sir.

969
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:48,140
Sir?

970
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:50,080
-Ranjan sir.
-Who is it?

971
01:05:50,310 --> 01:05:51,980
Sir, it's me, Shakthi.

972
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:56,820
What do you want
this time of the night?

973
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:00,550
There's a strong connection between
Suresh's case and actress Ramya, sir.

974
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:02,890
-What makes you say that?
-Sir.

975
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:04,960
When I went to Ramya's house

976
01:06:05,030 --> 01:06:07,360
I saw a photo of Ramya
wearing this same necklace.

977
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:13,230
Superb.

978
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:16,500
-I'll get ready and come.
-Okay, sir.

979
01:06:23,140 --> 01:06:24,210
Careful, sir.

980
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:32,320
Sir, come.

981
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:40,890
Sir, this is the photo I told you about.

982
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:42,560
Look at her necklace.

983
01:06:42,630 --> 01:06:43,430
Perfect match!

984
01:06:44,970 --> 01:06:46,800
Sir, let me see if I can
find some other clue.

985
01:07:18,670 --> 01:07:20,500
Sir, tread softly.

986
01:07:28,810 --> 01:07:30,910
-Any clues, Shakthi?
-Sir!

987
01:07:32,010 --> 01:07:33,050
Someone else is in here.

988
01:07:38,850 --> 01:07:39,990
Hey!

989
01:07:42,190 --> 01:07:43,290
Stop, I say.

990
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:56,870
Sir, get in fast.

991
01:08:11,850 --> 01:08:12,790
Sir, police.

992
01:08:18,430 --> 01:08:19,390
Shakthi.

993
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:21,530
Don't think this is an old car.

994
01:08:22,260 --> 01:08:23,430
Press the accelerator.

995
01:08:49,690 --> 01:08:51,960
By the time we stop
and explain to our men,

996
01:08:52,030 --> 01:08:53,360
he may escape.

997
01:08:53,430 --> 01:08:54,430
What do we do, sir?

998
01:08:55,060 --> 01:08:56,160
Divert.

999
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:22,360
Control room, suspicious sandal Fiat

1000
01:09:22,420 --> 01:09:23,860
Number plate not clear.

1001
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:26,130
Report as soon as you spot it, over.

1002
01:09:29,860 --> 01:09:32,300
Hello, Control room
Sandal color Fiat

1003
01:09:32,370 --> 01:09:34,840
-heading towards Anna Nagar round-turn.
-Turn right.

1004
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:42,510
Hello, Control room
TSI Shakthi here.

1005
01:09:42,810 --> 01:09:46,080
Suspicious black Honda Civic
is heading towards Egmore.

1006
01:09:46,150 --> 01:09:48,280
Report the moment you spot it, over.

1007
01:09:48,980 --> 01:09:51,590
Sir, the black Honda Civic you mentioned

1008
01:09:51,650 --> 01:09:54,050
is heading towards Egmore
Child Hospital, over.

1009
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:07,530
Smart, Shakthi.

1010
01:10:31,830 --> 01:10:33,260
Sir, let's go and nab him.

1011
01:10:33,330 --> 01:10:34,900
No, no, no.

1012
01:10:36,430 --> 01:10:37,530
Are you mad?

1013
01:10:38,130 --> 01:10:39,100
He's a criminal.

1014
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:46,370
See, he's just a Sim card.

1015
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:51,780
If you nab him now, it will be tough to
find out the tower that's operating him.

1016
01:10:53,810 --> 01:10:56,550
Let's wait till that Sim card gets a call.

1017
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:15,570
Sir, sir.

1018
01:11:16,270 --> 01:11:17,940
I think he must be a mechanic, sir.

1019
01:11:18,010 --> 01:11:20,940
-Hey! Get me spanner 10-11.
-Yes, sir.

1020
01:11:23,910 --> 01:11:25,380
Okay, you take some rest.

1021
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:28,250
-I'll take over now.
-Okay, sir.

1022
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,190
Sir, he's leaving.

1023
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:48,870
-Shakthi.
-Sir?

1024
01:11:49,470 --> 01:11:51,670
This place somehow seems familiar to me.

1025
01:11:52,810 --> 01:11:54,980
So many buildings have come up now.

1026
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:57,680
How many years do you think
since these were built?

1027
01:11:57,750 --> 01:12:01,120
This area was developed
about 15 years ago.

1028
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:02,980
Oh!

1029
01:12:13,730 --> 01:12:17,100
He doesn't look like
an ordinary car mechanic.

1030
01:12:18,970 --> 01:12:19,970
Yeah.

1031
01:12:20,270 --> 01:12:23,040
COROMANDEL RESORT

1032
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:49,560
Sir, sir, don't go that...

1033
01:13:33,770 --> 01:13:35,740
What are you doing here?
We may lose him, come soon.

1034
01:13:35,810 --> 01:13:37,240
-Shakthi.
-Sir?

1035
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:39,750
I have been here before.

1036
01:13:40,150 --> 01:13:42,950
Didn't I report I found a knife
in Suresh's car that was burnt?

1037
01:13:43,150 --> 01:13:44,280
This is that place.

1038
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:46,320
Behind that tree.

1039
01:13:47,290 --> 01:13:48,320
What are you saying, sir?

1040
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:50,120
I am damn sure.

1041
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:59,470
Sir, your campaign funding was through
black money from many corporate firms.

1042
01:13:59,530 --> 01:14:02,840
That's the strong rumor.
What is your comment?

1043
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:06,370
Whoever is finding fault with me today,

1044
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:10,210
should remember that people haven't
forgotten the corruption during their rule.

1045
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:17,620
Sir, our channel has telecast a program
about the biggest scam by your Party.

1046
01:14:17,690 --> 01:14:18,820
Your comment on it?

1047
01:14:19,090 --> 01:14:20,820
People have given you the answer.

1048
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:24,090
In a few hours
counting will be done.

1049
01:14:24,190 --> 01:14:26,790
The result will be in our favor for sure.

1050
01:14:26,860 --> 01:14:28,800
What other answer are you expecting?

1051
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:32,500
Sir, Ramya's murder,

1052
01:14:32,570 --> 01:14:33,330
Suresh case,

1053
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:37,740
I think it's all interlinked.

1054
01:14:38,370 --> 01:14:41,180
None of these can be passed off
as mere coincidence.

1055
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:43,880
I somehow feel the murderer
we are after

1056
01:14:45,050 --> 01:14:46,650
is here somewhere.

1057
01:14:48,180 --> 01:14:49,750
[mobile ringing]

1058
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:53,190
Hello, tell me, Swathi.

1059
01:14:53,790 --> 01:14:56,220
-Dad wants to tell you something.
-Okay.

1060
01:14:58,590 --> 01:14:59,660
Dad.

1061
01:15:04,130 --> 01:15:05,300
-Sir.-Yes, Kumar.

1062
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:07,800
I have to talk to you
about this case.

1063
01:15:08,740 --> 01:15:10,140
Can you come over immediately?

1064
01:15:11,570 --> 01:15:12,870
I'll come right now.

1065
01:15:13,910 --> 01:15:17,140
Editor Kumar wants to discuss something
with me regarding this case.

1066
01:15:17,210 --> 01:15:18,750
Shall I go meet him now?

1067
01:15:18,810 --> 01:15:20,610
-Find out and call me.
-Okay.

1068
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:21,820
I'll take care at this end.

1069
01:15:30,590 --> 01:15:32,330
-Follow that reaction.
-Hello, is that so?

1070
01:15:33,290 --> 01:15:34,260
Okay.

1071
01:15:34,330 --> 01:15:35,430
Okay.

1072
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:37,360
Sir, news confirmed
from three different sources.

1073
01:15:38,570 --> 01:15:41,300
Don't be in a hurry, I'm waiting
for a very important source.

1074
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:42,040
Okay, sir.

1075
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:44,870
Results of all constituencies
have been announced.

1076
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:48,280
We will know very soon
the next chief minister of Tamil Nadu.

1077
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:49,810
Wide.

MMTK LEADING
VOLUNTEERS CELEBRATE

1079
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:05,460
Sir, the ballot counting today
has created a stir all over Tamil Nadu.

1080
01:16:05,530 --> 01:16:07,830
Rumor is your Party is involved
in the maximum number of scams.

1081
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:08,930
What is your opinion?

1082
01:16:09,230 --> 01:16:11,830
What do you think is the reason
for your victory in this election?

1083
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:13,600
You sound like a broken record, madam.

1084
01:16:13,670 --> 01:16:16,370
If our Party was involved in scams,
could we have won in so many places?

1085
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:21,540
-One minute.
-Tell me, sir.

1086
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:23,510
Who owns this resort?

1087
01:16:23,910 --> 01:16:24,980
I don't know, sir.

1088
01:16:25,210 --> 01:16:26,410
Rascal!

1089
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:28,920
Sir, why did you hit me now?

1090
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:31,420
Why are you working here
without knowing who your boss is?

1091
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:34,220
You belong to a generation
which disrespects elders.

1092
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:36,260
Sir, why are you talking
in such a disjointed way?

1093
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:38,930
Hey! Go and call your owner now.

1094
01:16:39,630 --> 01:16:41,030
-Go.
-Okay, sir.

1095
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:42,630
Tell him I am from
Lockup News.

1096
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:44,700
I swear our Party
isn't involved in any scam!

1097
01:16:44,770 --> 01:16:47,200
In Suresh's case, how did you
find out Ramya's connection?

1098
01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:49,340
With the jewelry of course.

1099
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:52,740
You don't know that Ramya's
initial years as an actress, right?

1100
01:16:53,540 --> 01:16:56,610
When she entered
the cinema industry in 1999

1101
01:16:57,310 --> 01:16:59,610
all the big shots and
celebrities in the city

1102
01:17:00,150 --> 01:17:02,180
went behind her
absolutely besotted by her.

1103
01:17:03,020 --> 01:17:05,050
I had a friend by the name Gopal.

1104
01:17:05,590 --> 01:17:07,190
In that--

1105
01:17:07,820 --> 01:17:10,390
He was a reporter in EETTI.

1106
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:12,090
Poor chap! He's dead now.

1107
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:15,660
He had all the underworld contacts
you can ever imagine.

1108
01:17:15,730 --> 01:17:19,670
One of those dons he knew
and our dear heroine.

1109
01:17:19,930 --> 01:17:21,970
He said they had deep contact.

1110
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:23,270
Camera two.

1111
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:26,310
I'll shut down the entire resort
in just one write-up.

1112
01:17:26,370 --> 01:17:27,880
He hit me while I was talking.

1113
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:29,340
-Let me ask, wait.
-Hey.

1114
01:17:29,540 --> 01:17:30,710
Not just you.

1115
01:17:30,910 --> 01:17:32,850
If my questions don't get answered,

1116
01:17:33,010 --> 01:17:34,550
-I'll slap all of you.
-Sir.

1117
01:17:34,620 --> 01:17:37,520
What do you want to know?
Resort owner's name, that's all?

1118
01:17:37,790 --> 01:17:40,520
Hey! All I asked was
the name of your boss.

1119
01:17:40,590 --> 01:17:41,860
Did I ask for the resort?

1120
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:43,360
Blurt it out
for God's sake.

1121
01:17:43,420 --> 01:17:46,530
That don fell flat for her,
head over heels.

1122
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:49,060
He has even gifted her
expensive jewelry.

1123
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:51,070
Rumor is that necklace...

1124
01:17:52,330 --> 01:17:54,800
From the Vijayanagar dynasty
was gifted to her.

1125
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:56,900
Not just precious jewelry,

1126
01:17:56,970 --> 01:17:59,370
many of the films this female acted in

1127
01:17:59,570 --> 01:18:00,770
Don was the financier.

1128
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:03,410
No one is aware of all this.

1129
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:06,610
Once when Gopal was totally tanked,

1130
01:18:07,550 --> 01:18:08,550
he blabbered everything.

1131
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:12,850
You will be shell shocked
if I tell you the don's name.

1132
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:14,590
-Shall I tell you?
-Who, sir?

1133
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:18,130
Take a wild guess!

1134
01:18:18,190 --> 01:18:20,090
-Live.-Breaking News.

1135
01:18:20,260 --> 01:18:23,430
Minjur Ranganathan has been elected
the new chief minister of Tamil Nadu,

1136
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:25,930
on behalf of MMTK party.

1137
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:30,670
MR. MINJUR RANGANATHAN ELECTED
AS CHIEF MINISTER OF TAMIL NADU

1138
01:18:30,740 --> 01:18:32,940
MMTK HAS CREATED HISTORY
WITH 85% VOTES IN THEIR FAVOR

1139
01:18:33,010 --> 01:18:36,040
MR. RANGANATHAN SECURED 90% VOTES
IN HIS CONSTITUENCY AND WINS HANDS DOWN

1140
01:18:36,110 --> 01:18:39,910
Sir, even if we enquire this case from
various angles, it all comes back to

1141
01:18:39,980 --> 01:18:41,780
-Minjur Ranganathan.-Yes.

1142
01:18:41,980 --> 01:18:43,920
Between Suresh's case
and Ramya's murder now

1143
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:46,920
there is a definite link
with Minjur Ranganathan.

1144
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:48,820
But we don't know how or why.

1145
01:18:49,690 --> 01:18:51,930
First of all, we should find out
who is Minjur Ranganathan

1146
01:18:52,230 --> 01:18:54,330
and what's his background

1147
01:18:54,630 --> 01:18:56,930
-to decode this link.
-Okay, sir.

1148
01:18:57,230 --> 01:18:59,130
I'll go to Minjur now
and try to find out.

1149
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:02,540
You should not arouse anyone's suspicion
about your enquiry over there.

1150
01:19:03,770 --> 01:19:06,110
If we have decided
to enter the lion's den

1151
01:19:06,540 --> 01:19:08,810
we have to play the game
according to its strength.

1152
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:10,110
Be careful, Shakthi.

1153
01:19:10,610 --> 01:19:11,610
Sure, sir.

1154
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:22,660
Where have I seen him before?

1155
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:39,770
Zindabad!
Zindabad!

1156
01:19:42,140 --> 01:19:44,610
[shouting celebratory slogans]

1157
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:48,620
Sir, where is the old house of
Minjur Ranganathan sir?

1158
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:52,090
Go straight and turn right, sir.

1159
01:19:54,220 --> 01:19:55,760
Okay, thanks.

1160
01:20:01,260 --> 01:20:03,400
The future chief minister of Tamil Nadu

1161
01:20:03,460 --> 01:20:05,500
his first residence is this, sir,

1162
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:08,800
My beloved people of Tamil Nadu
who are more precious--

1163
01:20:08,870 --> 01:20:10,070
He is Manickam.

1164
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:12,640
Manickam, you know our sir
is returning tomorrow?

1165
01:20:12,710 --> 01:20:14,840
The police are here
to inspect our house.

1166
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:16,340
-Hello, sir.
-Greetings.

1167
01:20:16,540 --> 01:20:18,350
This is a very small town, sir.

1168
01:20:18,410 --> 01:20:19,910
Not even known to
our neighboring town.

1169
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:22,950
Our Ranganathan sir is the reason
our town is on the map now.

1170
01:20:23,450 --> 01:20:24,950
How many years have you been here?

1171
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:26,190
40 years, sir.

1172
01:20:26,250 --> 01:20:28,760
When we were kids
we used to play with marbles.

1173
01:20:28,820 --> 01:20:30,820
Who will believe me
if I talk of our past?

1174
01:20:30,890 --> 01:20:32,090
Did I ask you all these tales?

1175
01:20:32,430 --> 01:20:34,090
-Out you go.
-Okay, sir.

1176
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:35,830
What did I say to rile him?

1177
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:36,960
Sir, can I look round?

1178
01:20:37,030 --> 01:20:38,470
-Sure, sir.
-Thanks.

1179
01:20:46,740 --> 01:20:48,110
Greetings.

1180
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:51,550
My beloved people of Tamil Nadu
who are more precious than my own life.

1181
01:20:51,610 --> 01:20:57,620
I thank you profusely for the faith
you have placed in me and my party.

1182
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:17,600
Sir, when I checked
Minjur Ranganathan's house,

1183
01:21:17,670 --> 01:21:21,840
I found an old bible and a lot of
brochures preaching Christianity.

1184
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:25,010
But the old man living there for decades
shows all the signs of a true Hindu.

1185
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:27,010
Sir, there are two Christians in our case.

1186
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:28,980
One is Sebastian,
another is Fernandez.

1187
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:32,250
One of them has a link
with Ranganathan for sure, sir.

1188
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:34,460
Minjur Ranganathan, who won the election,

1189
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:38,130
is reaching his MMTK party office
with the loud cheers of the peop...

1190
01:21:38,190 --> 01:21:40,530
Shakthi, give me some time.

1191
01:21:41,530 --> 01:21:42,960
I'll call you back.

1192
01:21:48,740 --> 01:21:49,740
What, wise old man?

1193
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:50,840
LOCKUP

1194
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:54,010
At your age, do you need
to be a la Hercule Poirot?

1195
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:56,680
I read your paper
while waiting for you.

1196
01:21:57,240 --> 01:21:58,880
If you don't stop with this,

1197
01:21:59,950 --> 01:22:01,620
news that you are dead

1198
01:22:02,150 --> 01:22:04,220
will be headlines in your own paper.

1199
01:22:05,590 --> 01:22:06,720
Understand?

1200
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:09,120
I think you do.

1201
01:22:13,460 --> 01:22:14,900
For some days,

1202
01:22:15,460 --> 01:22:21,200
we should not give any benefits
or posts to members of our family.

1203
01:22:24,270 --> 01:22:26,110
[mobile ringing]

1204
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:33,250
Sir, a reporter from Lockup news

1205
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:37,690
came to our resort and enquired
about the owner and created a ruckus.

1206
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:39,550
Is he still alive?

1207
01:22:40,450 --> 01:22:41,990
He is travelling
right in front of me.

1208
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:43,790
Shall I follow him and kill him?

1209
01:22:44,530 --> 01:22:46,160
Hey! No, don't.

1210
01:22:46,730 --> 01:22:50,830
I don't want any problem when I am
about to be sworn in as chief minister.

1211
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:52,030
But follow him.

1212
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:54,230
Just update me on his moves.

1213
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:56,700
Definitely, sir.
I'll tail his car now.

1214
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:18,890
Perceptive and hawk-eyed

1215
01:23:19,730 --> 01:23:24,500
He will stride
casually this side

1216
01:23:24,670 --> 01:23:29,840
Concentration will go
out of the window

1217
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:34,440
He is one who buries underground
strategies never to be found

1218
01:23:34,540 --> 01:23:38,680
Masquerader with a pen name

1219
01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:43,220
Charade is the name of his game

1220
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:31,970
Fernandez!

1221
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,670
Fernandez!

1222
01:25:45,410 --> 01:25:46,970
-Where are you?
-Sir.

1223
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:49,980
I am waiting outside
that Press reporter's house.

1224
01:25:51,010 --> 01:25:53,180
Santosh and another chap
are just coming in.

1225
01:25:53,380 --> 01:25:56,020
You are following a police officer!

1226
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:59,050
He is a press reporter, sir.

1227
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:00,750
Moron! He is a police officer.

1228
01:26:00,820 --> 01:26:03,020
He doesn't look like a policeman.

1229
01:26:04,630 --> 01:26:05,730
Idiot!

1230
01:26:06,290 --> 01:26:07,860
He is the one who recognized me.

1231
01:26:07,930 --> 01:26:11,330
The same policeman who found out
my real name and yelled out in the crowd.

1232
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:14,400
Our introduction dates back four decades!

1233
01:26:16,170 --> 01:26:20,240
Both the men who chased you
are from the police force.

1234
01:26:20,710 --> 01:26:26,010
Bring both the police officer and
the reporter straight to my doorstep.

1235
01:26:26,250 --> 01:26:29,150
Take more men from our team
if you want additional back up.

1236
01:26:29,780 --> 01:26:31,650
I don't want you to miss either of them.

1237
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:33,650
Sir, three of us can manage.

1238
01:26:34,820 --> 01:26:36,190
We will do the needful.

1239
01:26:36,490 --> 01:26:37,860
No problem.

1240
01:26:51,410 --> 01:26:52,440
Hello?

1241
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:54,170
-Shakthi.-Yes, sir.

1242
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:56,580
That driver who was Fernandez then

1243
01:26:56,740 --> 01:26:59,210
is roaming around in disguise
as Minjur Ranganathan today.

1244
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:00,680
How did you find this out, sir?

1245
01:27:00,750 --> 01:27:01,950
Where are you now, sir?

1246
01:27:02,020 --> 01:27:04,390
Among all those people I investigated

1247
01:27:04,450 --> 01:27:07,090
only his face was
etched deeply in my mind.

1248
01:27:08,420 --> 01:27:09,920
The same false smile.

1249
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:12,890
The cunningness behind that smile.

1250
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:15,600
When I yelled out 'Fernandez'
while standing in that crowd,

1251
01:27:15,660 --> 01:27:18,900
without him realizing he showed me
his real face flash for a minute.

1252
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:23,240
The pieces of the jigsaw
are fitting in now.

1253
01:27:23,300 --> 01:27:26,040
Your job now is to fix
the puzzle picture perfect.

1254
01:27:26,310 --> 01:27:27,270
Definitely, sir.

1255
01:27:27,340 --> 01:27:29,140
I want you to know this also.

1256
01:27:29,580 --> 01:27:33,210
Your journalist friend Kumar
is in danger now.

1257
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:35,980
Try to save him at once.

1258
01:27:36,050 --> 01:27:37,550
I will rush there right now, sir.

1259
01:27:37,620 --> 01:27:40,290
-I'll be waiting at home.
-Okay, sir, I'll be there soon.

1260
01:29:09,340 --> 01:29:10,440
Step back, go.

1261
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:37,770
Hey! Old man has a single barrel gun.

1262
01:29:38,970 --> 01:29:40,570
Two of us are here.

1263
01:29:42,340 --> 01:29:43,710
Who is your target?

1264
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:44,950
Me?

1265
01:29:45,250 --> 01:29:46,380
Or him?

1266
01:29:51,550 --> 01:29:53,790
Wise old man
done and dusted.

1267
01:29:53,850 --> 01:29:56,020
Shall we inform your relatives, huh?

1268
01:30:02,460 --> 01:30:03,530
Come.

1269
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:06,370
Acting too big for his boots
even at this age!

1270
01:30:08,170 --> 01:30:09,200
Hey!

1271
01:30:09,770 --> 01:30:10,870
Pick him also.

1272
01:30:10,940 --> 01:30:12,710
Minjur Ranganathan,

1273
01:30:12,770 --> 01:30:14,740
nothing surprising about this.

1274
01:30:14,810 --> 01:30:17,310
Because of dirtying his hands in politics
and sporting a white-clad false look,

1275
01:30:17,810 --> 01:30:20,280
no one is aware of
the atrocities he orchestrates.

1276
01:30:20,950 --> 01:30:24,550
You are not safe here, you must
get discharged right away, let's go.

1277
01:30:30,660 --> 01:30:33,790
Sir, I've tied up the old man
in our farmhouse.

1278
01:30:34,190 --> 01:30:36,230
-What should I do with him?
-Glad to hear that.

1279
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:39,900
Go and kill that reporter.

1280
01:30:40,870 --> 01:30:44,340
Track down the other policeman.

1281
01:30:45,140 --> 01:30:47,040
I am coming over there.

1282
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:48,710
Okay, sir.

1283
01:30:55,420 --> 01:30:59,590
Do you know a reporter
called Kumar living here?

1284
01:30:59,650 --> 01:31:01,760
He has been admitted
in the Govt. hospital.

1285
01:31:01,820 --> 01:31:02,920
Govt. hospital?

1286
01:31:03,460 --> 01:31:05,390
-Which one?
-Egmore.

1287
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:07,900
-He is over there.
-Is that so?

1288
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:09,060
-Thank you.
-okay.

1289
01:31:25,550 --> 01:31:27,950
-Close the door and wait.
-Okay, sir.

1290
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:37,560
After many decades,

1291
01:31:38,230 --> 01:31:42,560
the name my parents baptized me
with a lot of love and care

1292
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:45,670
That too from your lips

1293
01:31:45,830 --> 01:31:48,940
When I heard you yell 'Fernandez'

1294
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:52,710
I was so, so very happy.

1295
01:31:52,870 --> 01:31:53,870
Oh!

1296
01:31:54,380 --> 01:31:55,380
Well!

1297
01:31:56,340 --> 01:31:57,910
When you were named
with tons of love

1298
01:31:57,980 --> 01:31:59,550
why are you loitering
under a false name?

1299
01:32:00,910 --> 01:32:04,550
When your victory is being celebrated
in every street, nook and cranny

1300
01:32:05,850 --> 01:32:08,260
what are you doing
all alone here with me?

1301
01:32:12,190 --> 01:32:15,900
Are you scared your real face
will be exposed to the world?

1302
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:17,560
Mr. Minjur Ranganathan

1303
01:32:17,630 --> 01:32:20,470
alias driver Fernandez.

1304
01:32:25,870 --> 01:32:27,910
In chewing the cud of my past,

1305
01:32:28,940 --> 01:32:31,180
I derive immense pleasure.

1306
01:32:33,010 --> 01:32:37,820
That too with you when you know
my history from prologue to epilogue.

1307
01:32:43,160 --> 01:32:45,030
Sir, tell me.

1308
01:32:45,090 --> 01:32:47,430
The chap tied inside
is a big time police officer.

1309
01:32:47,490 --> 01:32:50,400
Find out the other policeman's name

1310
01:32:50,630 --> 01:32:53,530
send sir with all due respect and fanfare.

1311
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:54,800
Okay, sir.

1312
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,470
Sister, has a patient been
admitted here by name Kumar?

1313
01:33:26,530 --> 01:33:27,800
Please check.

1314
01:33:29,670 --> 01:33:31,640
He got discharged this morning.

1315
01:33:31,710 --> 01:33:32,740
Is that so?

1316
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:38,150
Dad?

1317
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:40,080
What is happening here?

1318
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:42,020
Will you be kind enough to tell me?

1319
01:33:42,780 --> 01:33:44,720
Why are we hiding here
instead of going home?

1320
01:33:46,390 --> 01:33:47,650
Whatever it is, tell me.

1321
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:48,990
I will face it.

1322
01:33:49,060 --> 01:33:51,060
It isn't what you fear, dear.

1323
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:55,800
I know them well.

1324
01:33:56,060 --> 01:33:59,200
Just because they defaulted paying rent
why send thugs to hit them?

1325
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:03,400
If it is not inconvenient to you
can they stay here for a few days?

1326
01:34:03,470 --> 01:34:04,970
I don't mind.
They can stay here.

1327
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:06,570
Okay, thanks a ton.

1328
01:34:06,770 --> 01:34:09,110
Appa, why is he lying now?

1329
01:34:09,780 --> 01:34:11,610
What mess have you
got yourself into again?

1330
01:34:11,810 --> 01:34:14,650
You always threaten to commit suicide?

1331
01:34:14,980 --> 01:34:17,050
Give me that poison.
I'll end my life before you do.

1332
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:18,790
Hey! Shut up.

1333
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:21,790
She's out of her mind.

1334
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:25,590
Sir, I've informed madam
everything about you.

1335
01:34:25,790 --> 01:34:27,190
She will help you.

1336
01:34:27,260 --> 01:34:30,430
And most importantly,
no one should know that you are here.

1337
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:31,970
First switch off your phone.

1338
01:34:32,030 --> 01:34:33,430
Don't pick any call.

1339
01:34:33,500 --> 01:34:36,470
For your own good,
both of you stay indoors, okay?

1340
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:37,840
Take care.

1341
01:34:43,140 --> 01:34:46,780
Sir, give me the car.
Please give it to me.

1342
01:34:47,780 --> 01:34:51,120
Sir, give me the car.
Please give it to me.

1343
01:34:53,190 --> 01:34:55,390
Please return my car.

1344
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:57,860
Please give it back to me.

1345
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:01,260
Shakthi?

1346
01:35:01,660 --> 01:35:02,460
One minute.

1347
01:35:03,830 --> 01:35:06,070
Will you please tell me truthfully
what is happening here?

1348
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:08,100
-My dad is be--
-Swathi.

1349
01:35:08,540 --> 01:35:10,940
Your assumption is wrong.
Your dad hasn't committed any crime.

1350
01:35:11,010 --> 01:35:12,840
He is helping me with a case.

1351
01:35:13,270 --> 01:35:16,710
These safety measures are to ensure
he doesn't face any danger.

1352
01:35:16,780 --> 01:35:20,150
It is my responsibility to make sure
your dad is safe, okay?

1353
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:21,820
Don't get worked up unnecessarily.

1354
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:23,950
Call me if you need help, bye.

1355
01:35:27,790 --> 01:35:29,060
Ranjan sir.

1356
01:35:46,070 --> 01:35:47,370
His car isn't here.

1357
01:35:50,510 --> 01:35:51,610
Ranjan sir.

1358
01:35:54,010 --> 01:35:55,080
Ranjan sir.

1359
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:07,430
Blood stains?

1360
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:10,230
Ranjan sir!

1361
01:36:11,070 --> 01:36:12,170
Ranjan sir.

1362
01:36:14,870 --> 01:36:15,940
Shucks!

1363
01:36:41,700 --> 01:36:45,230
Cough up his name.
That policeman partner of yours.

1364
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:47,840
I won't tell you.

1365
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:49,900
All these slight taps won't work, right?

1366
01:36:50,740 --> 01:36:51,840
Give me the gun.

1367
01:36:54,040 --> 01:36:55,640
Tell me now.
Who is he?

1368
01:37:02,950 --> 01:37:03,980
Shankar.

1369
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:06,120
Try to track him down.

1370
01:37:06,190 --> 01:37:07,190
Chee!

1371
01:37:07,820 --> 01:37:09,690
You'll say Shankar,
and then Rajini.

1372
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:12,160
Am I an imbecile to
believe all this crap, huh?

1373
01:37:12,230 --> 01:37:13,230
Tell me now.

1374
01:37:56,470 --> 01:37:58,840
Sir, you'll be fine.
Don't be scared.

1375
01:37:58,910 --> 01:38:00,940
Nothing to worry.
Be brave.

1376
01:38:34,940 --> 01:38:36,480
Hey! You are that cop?

1377
01:38:41,820 --> 01:38:42,820
Sir?

1378
01:38:45,950 --> 01:38:48,460
Sir, you'll be fine.
Don't be scared.

1379
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:49,620
Wait.

1380
01:38:51,190 --> 01:38:52,390
Hello?

1381
01:38:54,290 --> 01:38:56,260
Hello?
Ambulance?

1382
01:39:00,630 --> 01:39:04,470
Hello, Control room, an ambulance
is rushing to Central Govt. Hospital.

1383
01:39:04,540 --> 01:39:06,540
Please clear the traffic
in that area, over.

1384
01:39:15,550 --> 01:39:18,220
Sir, be brave, we will
get you to the hospital soon.

1385
01:39:29,960 --> 01:39:31,500
Traffic jam, sir.

1386
01:39:40,870 --> 01:39:42,110
I'll go ahead and clear traffic.

1387
01:39:42,180 --> 01:39:43,280
You keep following.

1388
01:39:43,340 --> 01:39:45,950
Hey! Move,
there's an ambulance behind you.

1389
01:39:46,010 --> 01:39:47,110
Go, go fast.

1390
01:39:48,220 --> 01:39:49,520
Hey! Move, man.

1391
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:52,450
Ambulance behind you.
Please move.

1392
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:53,550
Hello, Control Room.

1393
01:39:53,620 --> 01:39:56,820
Chockablock, ambulance is stuck in
the subway in Parry's, clear it, over.

1394
01:39:57,360 --> 01:39:59,460
Hey! Can't you see
the ambulance at the back?

1395
01:39:59,890 --> 01:40:02,900
Save a life, man.
An ambulance is right behind you.

1396
01:40:07,940 --> 01:40:09,940
Hey! Are you deaf or what?

1397
01:40:10,040 --> 01:40:11,740
Ambulance is waiting behind you, scumbag!

1398
01:40:12,510 --> 01:40:13,570
Hello, Control Room.

1399
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:15,980
Please clear the traffic in the subway.

1400
01:40:51,180 --> 01:40:54,150
Many people have a lot to say
about your past, sir.

1401
01:40:54,210 --> 01:40:55,820
What is your comment on it, sir?

1402
01:40:55,880 --> 01:40:57,920
Regarding my past,

1403
01:40:57,990 --> 01:41:00,720
many people are spreading
baseless vile rumors.

1404
01:41:01,020 --> 01:41:04,590
In what way are they eligible
to malign my character?

1405
01:41:38,060 --> 01:41:41,300
My boss is now the chief minister.

1406
01:41:42,300 --> 01:41:45,600
Not just you,
no one can even--

1407
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,200
Impossible!

1408
01:42:34,180 --> 01:42:38,150
At least he was happy recollecting
his happy times with his wife and child.

1409
01:42:38,750 --> 01:42:41,760
I thought I was such a Smart Alec
and I dragged him into this case--

1410
01:42:42,660 --> 01:42:44,120
I killed him myself.

1411
01:42:44,860 --> 01:42:47,630
They let their tongues run about
importance of humanitarian concern.

1412
01:42:47,900 --> 01:42:50,100
But even in an emergency they don't
give way for an ambulance to pass.

1413
01:42:50,830 --> 01:42:52,400
What a disgusting world
we live in, Swathi.

1414
01:42:53,030 --> 01:42:54,030
Damn!

1415
01:42:55,940 --> 01:42:57,200
It never pays to be good.

1416
01:42:59,070 --> 01:43:01,010
We should blame ourselves
for the present situation.

1417
01:43:02,240 --> 01:43:06,550
Only an accused like Ranganathan
will rule people like us!

1418
01:43:07,480 --> 01:43:08,880
Don't feel guilty, Shakthi.

1419
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:12,450
You shouldn't step back from this case.

1420
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:15,660
That's why I feel Ranjan sir
has sacrificed his life.

1421
01:43:17,190 --> 01:43:18,190
Don't lose heart.

1422
01:43:19,060 --> 01:43:20,930
Do something to respect his death.

1423
01:43:21,700 --> 01:43:22,500
Come on, Shakthi.

1424
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:31,640
Sorry, I just went into
random rambling mode.

1425
01:43:32,640 --> 01:43:34,210
I hope you have no hassles here?

1426
01:43:34,310 --> 01:43:35,110
Everything okay?

1427
01:43:36,540 --> 01:43:38,480
Dad's friend Gopal called.

1428
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:41,480
He had given his power bank
when he visited him in the hospital.

1429
01:43:41,950 --> 01:43:43,320
Can you return it?

1430
01:43:43,480 --> 01:43:45,090
-Okay.
-I'll bring it.

1431
01:43:51,860 --> 01:43:54,500
In Suresh's case, how did you
find out Ramya's connection?

1432
01:43:54,830 --> 01:43:56,260
With the jewelry of course.

1433
01:43:56,460 --> 01:43:58,400
I had a friend by name Gopal.

1434
01:43:58,470 --> 01:44:00,530
He was a reporter in EETTI?

1435
01:44:00,630 --> 01:44:01,740
Gopal?

1436
01:44:03,300 --> 01:44:04,770
Poor chap! He's dead now.

1437
01:44:10,540 --> 01:44:11,680
Here--

1438
01:44:15,320 --> 01:44:16,620
EETTI MAGAZINE

1439
01:44:16,680 --> 01:44:17,990
I verified, sir.

1440
01:44:18,150 --> 01:44:20,150
No one by name Gopal

1441
01:44:20,220 --> 01:44:21,720
works here, sir.

1442
01:44:22,790 --> 01:44:23,820
Okay.

1443
01:44:24,730 --> 01:44:25,690
Thank you.

1444
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:32,030
Hello?

1445
01:44:36,440 --> 01:44:38,770
Shakthi, for a long time
I've been hunting them down.

1446
01:44:38,870 --> 01:44:40,340
Nabbed them just now.

1447
01:44:40,840 --> 01:44:42,380
I'll give you ten minutes.

1448
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:44,310
Collect whatever
information you need.

1449
01:44:44,980 --> 01:44:46,210
Thanks, Shiva.

1450
01:44:49,780 --> 01:44:52,990
Bro, you don't know who I am.

1451
01:44:53,420 --> 01:44:56,990
Very soon I will ensure
even you don't know who you are!

1452
01:44:58,860 --> 01:45:00,490
Sir, sir.

1453
01:45:01,200 --> 01:45:02,200
Sir.

1454
01:45:10,140 --> 01:45:12,710
Sir, sir, I'll tell you everything.

1455
01:45:12,770 --> 01:45:15,080
All because of that Kumar, sir.

1456
01:45:16,510 --> 01:45:19,550
We took that bag from him
because he hadn't paid.

1457
01:45:19,610 --> 01:45:21,720
We found the phone
and iPad in that bag.

1458
01:45:21,780 --> 01:45:25,750
Otherwise we are in no way
connected to that murder, sir.

1459
01:45:25,820 --> 01:45:27,520
I swear on myself, sir.

1460
01:45:33,630 --> 01:45:34,760
How did you nab them?

1461
01:45:34,830 --> 01:45:37,600
After actress Ramya died
we couldn't find her mobile.

1462
01:45:38,330 --> 01:45:39,770
Her phone was switched off.

1463
01:45:40,430 --> 01:45:43,200
It was switched on two days ago
near Hosur border.

1464
01:45:43,470 --> 01:45:45,810
When we traced that
these two got caught.

1465
01:45:46,470 --> 01:45:47,410
Okay.

1466
01:45:47,470 --> 01:45:48,780
-Thanks.
-It's okay.

1467
01:46:51,340 --> 01:46:53,540
Rayadu, I have a surprise for you.

1468
01:46:54,240 --> 01:46:55,340
Happy birthday.

1469
01:46:56,910 --> 01:46:57,910
Thank you so much, sir.

1470
01:47:02,220 --> 01:47:03,480
How is it?

1471
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:05,320
Do you like it?

1472
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:26,210
When we investigate a case,

1473
01:47:26,270 --> 01:47:29,440
our eyes should become blind
to the lies surrounding us.

1474
01:47:29,510 --> 01:47:31,380
Our hawk-eyes should focus
only on the truth.

1475
01:47:32,010 --> 01:47:34,180
I was a partner with a conniving cheat.

1476
01:47:35,550 --> 01:47:37,950
You intend cleaning the city?

1477
01:47:38,020 --> 01:47:41,120
Hey! Only I know your true colors, da.

1478
01:47:43,990 --> 01:47:45,090
Hello, sir.

1479
01:47:46,790 --> 01:47:47,800
Who are you?

1480
01:47:51,630 --> 01:47:52,930
Tell me the truth.

1481
01:47:53,670 --> 01:47:54,670
Kumar?

1482
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:56,670
Or Rayadu?

1483
01:47:59,970 --> 01:48:01,280
Hi Shakthi.

1484
01:48:02,680 --> 01:48:04,040
-Hi.
-When did you come?

1485
01:48:04,110 --> 01:48:05,110
Just now.

1486
01:48:07,880 --> 01:48:09,680
Is there any problem?

1487
01:48:09,750 --> 01:48:11,290
Nothing of that sort.

1488
01:48:31,310 --> 01:48:34,480
Honorable Mr. Ranganathan who will
be sworn in as our Chief Minister.

1489
01:48:34,640 --> 01:48:40,050
Will be inaugurating the temple function
in his home town Minjur tomorrow.

1490
01:48:40,110 --> 01:48:41,820
And preside over the festivities.

1491
01:48:41,880 --> 01:48:45,690
After which he will be sworn in
as Chief minister in Chennai.

1492
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:51,890
CM approaching, alert.

1493
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:18,850
Star of faith for every single youngster.

1494
01:49:18,920 --> 01:49:24,360
Guest of honor today, who will be
our Chief minister from tomorrow

1495
01:49:24,430 --> 01:49:26,190
needs no introduction.

1496
01:49:27,900 --> 01:49:29,100
From an ordinary farmer--

1497
01:49:29,160 --> 01:49:30,900
I'll meet everyone
after the function.

1498
01:49:31,200 --> 01:49:32,970
-Tell the volunteers.
-Okay, sir.

1499
01:49:33,430 --> 01:49:35,640
-CM is coming to the stage.
-Secure backstage, over.

1500
01:49:36,470 --> 01:49:37,640
Just five minutes, sir.

1501
01:49:37,710 --> 01:49:39,970
They want to play a video
about you, is it okay, sir?

1502
01:49:40,040 --> 01:49:41,480
Only five minutes?
No problem.

1503
01:49:41,540 --> 01:49:42,640
Sir?

1504
01:49:43,740 --> 01:49:46,610
Long live, Chief Minister.

1505
01:49:53,050 --> 01:49:54,660
Mr. Fernandez.

1506
01:49:55,320 --> 01:49:56,960
Don't move.

1507
01:50:00,190 --> 01:50:01,800
Friend of the poor and needy.

1508
01:50:01,860 --> 01:50:02,960
Doyen of compassion.

1509
01:50:03,460 --> 01:50:06,330
They are praising you sky-high.

1510
01:50:07,530 --> 01:50:12,910
What if people knew your true colors
and what you did to reach this far?

1511
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:16,510
Who the hell are you?

1512
01:50:18,510 --> 01:50:19,810
Inspector Ranjan.

1513
01:50:20,310 --> 01:50:21,520
Have you heard of him?

1514
01:50:23,950 --> 01:50:25,790
I am his spirit, his soul.

1515
01:50:29,160 --> 01:50:31,460
-Shakthi.
-Tell me.

1516
01:50:31,630 --> 01:50:33,790
-Minjur.
-Minjur?

1517
01:50:34,060 --> 01:50:35,460
Min-jur

1518
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,100
In chewing the cud of my past

1519
01:50:43,400 --> 01:50:45,540
I derive immense pleasure.

1520
01:50:47,140 --> 01:50:51,410
That too with you when you know
my history from prologue to epilogue.

1521
01:50:54,110 --> 01:50:56,980
Is it my fault to have been
born in a poor family?

1522
01:50:57,350 --> 01:51:00,790
I was such a gullible idiot.

1523
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:03,120
I worked day and night 24x7.

1524
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:07,760
One day life opened a new door for me.

1525
01:51:08,160 --> 01:51:09,930
-Sampath.
-Yes, sir.

1526
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,630
Jayachandran called me.

1527
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:15,070
He said the treasure
we have unearthed may be worth

1528
01:51:15,140 --> 01:51:17,300
around eight to nine million rupees.

1529
01:51:17,940 --> 01:51:20,070
Considering the present situation,

1530
01:51:20,140 --> 01:51:22,280
it's difficult to transfer it
to our Head office.

1531
01:51:22,980 --> 01:51:25,650
We can keep it in our office locker
safe and sound, right?

1532
01:51:25,710 --> 01:51:27,720
That's no problem, sir.
I can handle it.

1533
01:51:28,120 --> 01:51:30,750
From the moment I heard
their conversation,

1534
01:51:31,090 --> 01:51:33,020
I just couldn't sleep.

1535
01:51:33,350 --> 01:51:36,790
Instead of speaking somewhere else,

1536
01:51:36,860 --> 01:51:39,630
why did they speak within my earshot?

1537
01:51:39,830 --> 01:51:42,100
Eight to nine million.

1538
01:51:42,760 --> 01:51:45,300
If only I could lay my hands on it.

1539
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:49,700
The greed for money
spread like poison into my veins.

1540
01:51:50,440 --> 01:51:52,940
I didn't see Fernandez
in the rear view mirror.

1541
01:51:53,310 --> 01:51:55,680
I saw only my future.

1542
01:51:56,340 --> 01:51:58,050
In life, as I've learnt,

1543
01:51:58,210 --> 01:52:00,750
one shouldn't go around carrying

1544
01:52:00,810 --> 01:52:04,220
a scale of justice judging
right from wrong.

1545
01:52:07,960 --> 01:52:09,590
After killing Sampath,

1546
01:52:10,160 --> 01:52:12,730
I could have helped myself
to the treasure

1547
01:52:12,790 --> 01:52:14,660
and simply driven away.

1548
01:52:14,760 --> 01:52:17,600
But my entire lifetime,

1549
01:52:17,670 --> 01:52:23,140
I would have had to live with the fear
of hearing the police knock at my door.

1550
01:52:23,540 --> 01:52:28,140
Rayadu was a young boy
working in that house.

1551
01:52:31,110 --> 01:52:34,520
Do you remember interrogating him?

1552
01:52:35,350 --> 01:52:36,780
Innocent fellow.

1553
01:52:37,750 --> 01:52:41,160
He was so fond of his boss's daughter
he would give his life for her.

1554
01:52:41,960 --> 01:52:44,530
He had a basket full of small wishes.

1555
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:49,400
He wanted to study well
and climb up the ladder of success.

1556
01:52:49,600 --> 01:52:50,700
Give me the car, bro.

1557
01:52:50,760 --> 01:52:53,130
I fanned the flames of his wish list.

1558
01:52:53,330 --> 01:52:56,270
Even I want to buy
a car of my own.

1559
01:52:56,340 --> 01:52:57,970
You think it's possible? Tell me.

1560
01:52:58,270 --> 01:53:00,770
What the rich enjoy in real life

1561
01:53:01,080 --> 01:53:04,040
poor people like us have to
make it come true in our dreams!

1562
01:53:04,140 --> 01:53:07,350
But there is always
a short cut to success.

1563
01:53:07,720 --> 01:53:11,320
Only hitch, we have to tread
through thorns and stones, that's all.

1564
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:13,090
If you pay heed to my words,

1565
01:53:13,150 --> 01:53:17,360
your future can be
chiseled out as per your wish.

1566
01:53:20,290 --> 01:53:22,600
I asked him to mix

1567
01:53:23,030 --> 01:53:24,700
a sedative in their food.

1568
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:30,940
Don't worry one bit.

1569
01:53:31,340 --> 01:53:33,610
By the time they wake up
from their long, deep sleep,

1570
01:53:33,670 --> 01:53:37,240
we would have collected the treasure
and left this place far, far behind.

1571
01:53:39,680 --> 01:53:43,220
But he didn't know
the packet contained poison.

1572
01:53:45,790 --> 01:53:47,990
-Vaidehi!
-Ten.

1573
01:53:48,060 --> 01:53:49,390
Nine.

1574
01:53:49,960 --> 01:53:51,530
Eight.

1575
01:53:51,960 --> 01:53:53,290
Seven.

1576
01:53:53,960 --> 01:53:55,260
Six.

1577
01:53:55,660 --> 01:53:57,160
Five.

1578
01:53:57,870 --> 01:53:59,130
Four.

1579
01:53:59,870 --> 01:54:01,200
Three.

1580
01:54:01,900 --> 01:54:03,300
Two.

1581
01:54:03,670 --> 01:54:04,640
One.

1582
01:54:05,640 --> 01:54:07,140
Finish!

1583
01:54:10,340 --> 01:54:12,210
[sobbing loudly]

1584
01:54:12,350 --> 01:54:14,180
Sssshhh!

1585
01:54:16,780 --> 01:54:18,420
Pin drop silence!

1586
01:54:19,550 --> 01:54:23,120
From the cup you mixed it to the vessel

1587
01:54:23,190 --> 01:54:24,960
only your fingerprints are all over.

1588
01:54:25,830 --> 01:54:27,800
If you get caught,
only a noose will strangle you!

1589
01:54:33,870 --> 01:54:35,840
I asked you to go home.
What are you doing here?

1590
01:54:36,600 --> 01:54:39,870
I have to share a very important
piece of news with you, sir.

1591
01:54:41,510 --> 01:54:42,580
Doesn't matter.

1592
01:54:42,680 --> 01:54:44,140
Whatever it is,
you can tell me tomorrow.

1593
01:54:44,380 --> 01:54:45,510
Go home now.

1594
01:54:46,780 --> 01:54:50,180
We don't know if tomorrow
will exist for some, sir.

1595
01:54:50,720 --> 01:54:52,850
Especially for you.

1596
01:54:53,120 --> 01:54:54,660
What are you blabbering?

1597
01:54:59,430 --> 01:55:00,790
Patience, patience.

1598
01:55:01,860 --> 01:55:04,570
I haven't started my counting as yet.

1599
01:55:18,750 --> 01:55:24,280
I was worried my plans will go haywire
because Suresh did not show up on time.

1600
01:55:25,120 --> 01:55:29,590
But Lady Luck favored me throughout.

1601
01:55:30,120 --> 01:55:32,190
Hey! Switch off the light.

1602
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:45,910
Suresh, his wife and child weren't
the only ones who died that day.

1603
01:55:47,070 --> 01:55:49,510
Rayadu's dreams too.

1604
01:55:49,940 --> 01:55:52,180
I wanted to kill him too.

1605
01:55:52,480 --> 01:55:55,550
But there were a lot of
unfinished tasks to be done.

1606
01:55:55,620 --> 01:55:57,380
It was almost dawn.

1607
01:55:57,690 --> 01:56:01,160
Because he was a scaredy-cat
I didn't squash him to death.

1608
01:56:01,820 --> 01:56:03,060
Rayadu.

1609
01:56:05,290 --> 01:56:07,230
I hope you remember what I said.

1610
01:56:07,630 --> 01:56:08,960
You murdered them.

1611
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:13,300
I am doing all this to save you.

1612
01:56:14,340 --> 01:56:20,310
If you dare open your mouth to the police,
noose will be around your neck first!

1613
01:56:21,080 --> 01:56:22,940
What do you intend doing with her?

1614
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:25,380
Send her to Heaven.

1615
01:56:25,980 --> 01:56:27,310
You want to accompany her?

1616
01:56:29,550 --> 01:56:31,090
Just obey me implicitly.

1617
01:56:32,050 --> 01:56:33,950
I'll finish this and be back.

1618
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:37,060
My mind and heart
shattered to bits and pieces.

1619
01:56:37,120 --> 01:56:39,860
Not because of killing those four people.

1620
01:56:41,860 --> 01:56:46,770
For burning down the car I drove
with so much affection for ten years.

1621
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,800
If I hadn't been courageous enough
to get my hands bloodstained,

1622
01:56:51,210 --> 01:56:55,440
I would have remained
an ordinary driver all my life.

1623
01:56:55,910 --> 01:57:00,510
That's why I killed Suresh,
his wife and child in one stroke.

1624
01:57:01,220 --> 01:57:03,350
Through the security guard Mohan,

1625
01:57:03,980 --> 01:57:07,520
I spun a yarn that Suresh killed Sampath,

1626
01:57:08,190 --> 01:57:12,160
stole the loot and the whole family
absconded was my well fabricated story.

1627
01:57:15,030 --> 01:57:17,160
Everyone believed what I said.

1628
01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:20,400
The treasure worth
eight million that I looted.

1629
01:57:20,470 --> 01:57:23,540
Offered a new world for me
on a golden platter.

1630
01:57:23,600 --> 01:57:24,910
Eight million.

1631
01:57:25,110 --> 01:57:28,740
Today has fetched me
assets worth 800 billion.

1632
01:57:28,940 --> 01:57:31,450
A life that began with four murders,

1633
01:57:31,680 --> 01:57:34,520
made me stoop
to the lowest of lows.

1634
01:57:35,280 --> 01:57:40,090
It is said politics is the last resort
for the scoundrels.

1635
01:57:42,020 --> 01:57:43,920
Even I entered that world.

1636
01:57:45,160 --> 01:57:48,100
I reached a height
no one could dream of reaching.

1637
01:57:48,860 --> 01:57:52,700
Rayadu tried all kinds of plans
to get me caught.

1638
01:57:53,470 --> 01:57:55,200
He wasn't one bit successful.

1639
01:57:55,940 --> 01:57:59,070
Every individual has a wish list

1640
01:57:59,270 --> 01:58:02,110
and plenty of fear
tagging along too.

1641
01:58:02,180 --> 01:58:05,310
That accompaniment of fear is my strength.

1642
01:58:05,610 --> 01:58:10,250
Suresh's skeleton being found now
also works in my favor.

1643
01:58:10,580 --> 01:58:15,560
Because a lot of new
information has to be buried.

1644
01:58:15,820 --> 01:58:19,830
I have already killed Ramya
who knew everything about me.

1645
01:58:20,060 --> 01:58:24,500
Next in my list, you were the first man
to begin investigating this case.

1646
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:28,470
Poor you! Shouldn't you at least know
the truth before you breathe your last?

1647
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,170
Now you can truly rest in peace.

1648
01:58:31,540 --> 01:58:34,310
I'll ensure the rest of them
follow you soon.

1649
01:58:37,510 --> 01:58:41,280
Even now I only see
my future in the mirror.

1650
01:58:43,950 --> 01:58:45,720
One small pebble will do

1651
01:58:46,750 --> 01:58:49,120
to shatter that glass to pieces.

1652
01:58:50,820 --> 01:58:51,890
Is that so?

1653
01:58:55,800 --> 01:58:57,870
Who has the guts to
throw that small pebble?

1654
01:59:01,600 --> 01:59:05,270
Reminiscing past
gives immense pleasure.

1655
01:59:11,180 --> 01:59:14,080
False sense of bravado that law
cannot get its hands on you!

1656
01:59:16,180 --> 01:59:17,750
Listen to me loud and clear.

1657
01:59:17,820 --> 01:59:19,220
If I set my mind on it,

1658
01:59:19,350 --> 01:59:22,590
I can kill you right here and
leave without an iota of guilt.

1659
01:59:24,260 --> 01:59:26,690
So, you don't intend to kill me.

1660
01:59:26,890 --> 01:59:29,400
I don't want to
give you the easy way out.

1661
01:59:29,630 --> 01:59:32,100
You'll become a martyr
in the eyes of the people.

1662
01:59:32,330 --> 01:59:33,830
Then what about my plight?

1663
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:36,870
Media and Press will write
about me for a few days.

1664
01:59:38,940 --> 01:59:40,310
You are brilliant.

1665
01:59:40,370 --> 01:59:42,380
We can finish bargaining soon.

1666
01:59:43,080 --> 01:59:45,550
What do you gain?
How do I benefit?

1667
01:59:46,910 --> 01:59:50,620
Kumar alias Rayadu who knows
your crime list from A to Z

1668
01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:52,320
is under my custody now.

1669
01:59:52,590 --> 01:59:53,790
I could have killed him easily.

1670
01:59:54,190 --> 01:59:56,290
What is the return favor
you expect from me?

1671
01:59:57,830 --> 02:00:03,030
We invite Hon'ble chief minister
Mr. Minjur Ranganathan to the dais.

1672
02:00:27,190 --> 02:00:28,360
Sir.

1673
02:00:29,860 --> 02:00:31,530
Give me a minute
I'll tell my daughter.

1674
02:00:36,830 --> 02:00:38,730
MOTHER TERESA ORPHANAGE

1675
02:00:46,670 --> 02:00:47,470
Let's go, sir.

1676
02:00:56,480 --> 02:01:00,650
Sir, what if your plan
doesn't work out?

1677
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:04,360
I'll shoot him right there.

1678
02:01:04,960 --> 02:01:05,930
Sir.

1679
02:01:05,990 --> 02:01:09,130
Isn't it better to speak to
the channel head Guru?

1680
02:01:12,500 --> 02:01:13,170
Huh?

1681
02:01:14,070 --> 02:01:14,740
Sir?

1682
02:01:35,390 --> 02:01:36,460
What happened, sir?

1683
02:01:37,420 --> 02:01:38,790
Why did you stop the car here?

1684
02:01:39,960 --> 02:01:41,260
What will you tell Guru?

1685
02:01:42,460 --> 02:01:43,500
The whole story.

1686
02:01:43,700 --> 02:01:45,100
Minjur Ranganathan

1687
02:01:45,200 --> 02:01:46,930
and all his atrocities.

1688
02:01:47,300 --> 02:01:48,440
Then who are you?

1689
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:52,370
Will you confess the crimes
Fernandez and you committed?

1690
02:01:57,340 --> 02:01:59,610
I spared you yesterday
because your daughter walked in.

1691
02:02:00,710 --> 02:02:01,780
Tell me now.

1692
02:02:06,020 --> 02:02:08,920
I tried ever so often to
wreak vengeance on Ranganathan.

1693
02:02:09,820 --> 02:02:11,360
But he escaped all my nets.

1694
02:02:12,060 --> 02:02:14,500
Whatever you did
you could have told the police.

1695
02:02:15,600 --> 02:02:16,860
Why didn't you surrender?

1696
02:02:17,100 --> 02:02:18,300
It didn't occur to me.

1697
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:23,040
When I realized Fernandez had framed me
I searched every nook and corner for him.

1698
02:02:23,300 --> 02:02:25,040
But I couldn't track him at all.

1699
02:02:25,340 --> 02:02:26,740
15 years later,

1700
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:30,910
I found the same Fernandez had
a false face alias Minjur Ranganathan.

1701
02:02:31,380 --> 02:02:33,950
But he had reached untouchable heights.

1702
02:02:34,680 --> 02:02:36,980
I couldn't do anything to him, sir.

1703
02:02:37,480 --> 02:02:40,820
A man who killed a family for greed
with no guilty conscience at all.

1704
02:02:41,460 --> 02:02:43,160
If he occupies the CM's seat tomorrow,

1705
02:02:43,220 --> 02:02:45,360
I wonder how many
more families he'll destroy.

1706
02:02:45,430 --> 02:02:48,500
No one is alive other than me
as witness to all his ruthless crimes.

1707
02:02:49,160 --> 02:02:51,030
I don't care what happens to me.

1708
02:02:51,300 --> 02:02:53,430
I will confess everything I know.

1709
02:02:53,830 --> 02:02:55,300
You can record it, sir.

1710
02:02:56,800 --> 02:02:57,810
Go ahead.

1711
02:02:58,570 --> 02:02:59,710
So tell me now.

1712
02:02:59,940 --> 02:03:01,240
Why did you kill Ramya?

1713
02:03:01,980 --> 02:03:05,450
I didn't go and meet her
with the intention of killing her.

1714
02:03:05,880 --> 02:03:07,450
Just two questions, madam.

1715
02:03:09,350 --> 02:03:10,020
Go ahead, ask.

1716
02:03:11,090 --> 02:03:12,120
Madam,

1717
02:03:12,350 --> 02:03:13,720
in 1999,

1718
02:03:14,190 --> 02:03:19,860
Minjur Ranganathan gifted you a necklace
which belonged to the Vijayanagar dynasty.

1719
02:03:20,390 --> 02:03:22,300
You should ask the reporter
reporter who wrote it,

1720
02:03:22,630 --> 02:03:23,500
not me.

1721
02:03:23,700 --> 02:03:26,400
If I get to know the answer
to this one question, it is enough.

1722
02:03:26,470 --> 02:03:29,100
First get out or I'll scream
and bring the roof down!

1723
02:03:29,200 --> 02:03:30,540
-Get out!
-Only one question, madam.

1724
02:03:32,140 --> 02:03:33,110
Get out!

1725
02:03:57,830 --> 02:03:59,670
By kindling my aspirations
as an innocent youngster,

1726
02:04:00,500 --> 02:04:02,540
Fernandez made me
commit a grave sin.

1727
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:05,170
Though so many years have gone by

1728
02:04:06,470 --> 02:04:09,210
I find myself falling into
that hell hole again and again.

1729
02:04:10,240 --> 02:04:14,920
In these very hands that child Vaidehi
who used to call me brother died.

1730
02:04:16,880 --> 02:04:19,120
There is no redemption
for the sin I have committed, sir.

1731
02:04:19,550 --> 02:04:21,690
Ramya's iPad has
all the necessary evidence.

1732
02:04:23,020 --> 02:04:25,130
I have nothing more to hide, sir.

1733
02:04:25,830 --> 02:04:27,060
Don't think, sir.

1734
02:04:27,460 --> 02:04:28,560
Shoot me.

1735
02:04:33,870 --> 02:04:35,070
Trying to save you,

1736
02:04:35,670 --> 02:04:37,470
I committed an unjust act
by causing a good man to die.

1737
02:04:38,370 --> 02:04:40,070
It is a sinful waste
for men like you to live.

1738
02:04:40,440 --> 02:04:41,340
Sir, please.

1739
02:04:41,880 --> 02:04:42,940
Don't shoot, sir.

1740
02:04:44,310 --> 02:04:45,550
Sir, please don't.

1741
02:04:49,150 --> 02:04:50,950
Sir, please.

1742
02:04:51,950 --> 02:04:53,320
Sir!

1743
02:05:01,230 --> 02:05:03,560
[loud scream of frustration]

1744
02:05:32,490 --> 02:05:33,660
Greetings, sir.

1745
02:05:52,950 --> 02:05:53,950
I finished off Rayadu.

1746
02:05:55,220 --> 02:05:56,880
You've started falling at my feet.

1747
02:05:57,380 --> 02:05:58,790
You'll progress hereafter.

1748
02:06:00,350 --> 02:06:02,590
My home town Minjur is
your lucky mascot.

1749
02:06:04,630 --> 02:06:05,830
Bless you, my boy.

1750
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:12,370
Keep an eye on him.

1751
02:06:17,400 --> 02:06:20,710
Pride strides as craftiness

1752
02:06:20,770 --> 02:06:23,910
God maintains stoic silence

1753
02:06:23,980 --> 02:06:27,150
It is all in your hands

1754
02:06:27,210 --> 02:06:30,480
Con artist in governance

1755
02:06:30,550 --> 02:06:33,550
Hands of justice tied in helplessness

1756
02:06:33,620 --> 02:06:36,720
Enlightenment swirls in darkness

1757
02:06:36,790 --> 02:06:39,860
World will laud you with accolades

1758
02:06:39,960 --> 02:06:43,400
The man in disguise with many shades

1759
02:06:55,940 --> 02:06:59,050
Height of wisdom is creation

1760
02:06:59,110 --> 02:07:02,220
Height of conspiracy; power-play in action

1761
02:07:02,320 --> 02:07:05,520
People will flock around you like flies

1762
02:07:05,590 --> 02:07:08,720
The deceiver; man in disguise

1763
02:07:08,790 --> 02:07:11,830
The lamp's light is the wick's tip

1764
02:07:11,890 --> 02:07:15,130
Salvation is the soul's zenith

1765
02:07:15,200 --> 02:07:18,170
But you are fate's residue

1766
02:07:18,230 --> 02:07:21,640
Wolf in sheep's clothing through &amp; through

1767
02:07:34,210 --> 02:07:37,480
O' hunter who pursues unshaken

1768
02:07:37,550 --> 02:07:40,590
Will this folklore
Stubborn spirit slacken?

1769
02:07:40,790 --> 02:07:43,720
O' poser and pretender, neck deep cruelly

1770
02:07:43,790 --> 02:07:48,300
As you sow, so shall you reap duly
Your past will catch up with you truly

1771
02:08:15,760 --> 02:08:17,790
I won't let you die that easily.

1772
02:08:29,300 --> 02:08:30,640
Long live.

1773
02:08:31,840 --> 02:08:33,140
Long live!

1774
02:08:34,110 --> 02:08:36,440
[shouting slogans]

1775
02:08:37,780 --> 02:08:40,880
With the grace of Goddess Shakthi...

1776
02:08:41,220 --> 02:08:42,520
Long live!

1777
02:08:42,780 --> 02:08:45,190
With the loving support of
the people of Tamil Nadu,

1778
02:08:46,190 --> 02:08:51,890
from tomorrow I am committed to
serving all of you as your Chief Minister.

1779
02:08:52,190 --> 02:08:53,560
Long live!

1780
02:08:53,630 --> 02:08:55,900
Long live, leader!

1781
02:08:58,430 --> 02:08:59,730
Long live!!

1782
02:09:13,980 --> 02:09:16,980
Sins sow seeds of destiny

1783
02:09:17,080 --> 02:09:19,990
Sky showers rain as epiphany

1784
02:09:20,050 --> 02:09:22,860
Time speaks volumes slowly

1785
02:09:22,920 --> 02:09:25,990
Man with a face of duplicity

1786
02:09:26,060 --> 02:09:29,030
In the beginning
Evil may seem to win

1787
02:09:29,100 --> 02:09:32,000
But in the end however
Truth will always conquer

1788
02:09:32,070 --> 02:09:35,040
Karma will have the final say forever

1789
02:09:35,100 --> 02:09:38,540
A false face personifies
The man in disguise

1790
02:09:50,080 --> 02:09:51,650
Ten.

1791
02:09:52,120 --> 02:09:53,620
Nine.

1792
02:09:53,820 --> 02:09:55,120
Eight.

1793
02:09:55,820 --> 02:09:57,120
Seven.

1794
02:09:58,860 --> 02:10:00,160
Six.

1795
02:10:01,400 --> 02:10:02,830
Five.

1796
02:10:03,960 --> 02:10:04,930
Four.

1797
02:10:05,800 --> 02:10:06,670
Three.

1798
02:10:07,800 --> 02:10:08,800
Two.

1799
02:10:11,510 --> 02:10:12,310
One.

1800
02:10:29,520 --> 02:10:31,260
For the crimes Fernandez committed,

1801
02:10:32,860 --> 02:10:34,730
karma came up with divine justice!

1802
02:10:37,230 --> 02:10:38,700
For the mistake I made...

1803
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:40,870
[coughing]

1804
02:10:51,380 --> 02:10:52,650
Kumar, what happened?

1805
02:10:57,950 --> 02:10:59,050
Kumar.

1806
02:10:59,120 --> 02:11:00,550
Kumar, what's wrong?

1807
02:11:01,860 --> 02:11:07,860
Sir, by now the whole world will know
from A to Z about both of us.

1808
02:11:09,860 --> 02:11:12,430
How will I be able to
face my daughter, sir?

1809
02:11:13,870 --> 02:11:16,270
That's why from the poison
I administered to Fernandez

1810
02:11:16,540 --> 02:11:17,870
I consumed the left over.

1811
02:11:17,940 --> 02:11:18,940
Kumar!

1812
02:11:20,440 --> 02:11:21,780
Why did you do this?

1813
02:11:23,380 --> 02:11:25,380
I couldn't think of
any other option, sir.

1814
02:11:26,150 --> 02:11:27,210
How could you, Kumar?

1815
02:11:32,520 --> 02:11:36,590
Rayadu, we should always take
only the good in life.

1816
02:11:37,120 --> 02:11:38,730
Just trash the bad.

1817
02:11:40,590 --> 02:11:43,160
I never followed
any of his pearls of wisdom, sir.

1818
02:11:45,030 --> 02:11:46,530
My daughter--

1819
02:12:02,480 --> 02:12:04,320
Kumar, I'll rush you to the hospital.

1820
02:12:04,390 --> 02:12:05,450
Kumar.

1821
02:12:06,120 --> 02:12:07,790
Kumar, Kumar.

1822
02:12:12,490 --> 02:12:13,560
Kumar.

1823
02:12:15,300 --> 02:12:17,300
Kumar, Kumar.

1824
02:12:44,890 --> 02:12:48,560
I thought of telling you the truth
at the right time, Swathi.

1825
02:12:49,260 --> 02:12:50,030
I'm sorry.

1826
02:12:59,640 --> 02:13:03,640
Minjur Ranganathan, to be sworn in
as Chief Minister tomorrow was murdered.

1827
02:13:03,710 --> 02:13:07,010
He is allegedly guilty of
killing four people 43 years ago.

1828
02:13:07,080 --> 02:13:09,880
And looted the treasures of
Vijayanagar dynasty.

1829
02:13:09,950 --> 02:13:12,450
A series of astounding facts
are being unearthed.

1830
02:13:16,190 --> 02:13:18,090
SURESH
VIJAYALAKSHMI

1831
02:13:18,160 --> 02:13:18,830
VAIDEHI

1832
02:13:27,430 --> 02:13:28,470
Sir?

1833
02:13:28,840 --> 02:13:31,410
He will recover soon.
He's out of danger now.

1834
02:13:36,840 --> 02:13:39,610
I don't want this huge an amount, sir.
It's too much for what I did.

1835
02:13:39,910 --> 02:13:42,580
The value of a life is even more
priceless than this.

1836
02:13:43,080 --> 02:13:43,750
Thank you.

1837
02:13:51,060 --> 02:13:52,590
-Hi, Dad.
-Shakthi.

1838
02:13:53,090 --> 02:13:54,900
You said you were
coming home today?

1839
02:13:55,460 --> 02:13:56,400
I'll come soon.

1840
02:14:04,200 --> 02:14:07,170
JAGADAMMAL

1841
02:14:13,580 --> 02:14:15,480
JAGADAMMAL

1842
02:14:19,190 --> 02:14:20,620
I'll come home with good news.

1843
02:14:28,030 --> 02:14:29,700
When the police force was first formed,

1844
02:14:30,830 --> 02:14:32,870
uniform was white for everyone.

1845
02:14:33,200 --> 02:14:36,200
Uniform can be any color.

1846
02:14:36,300 --> 02:14:39,770
White, blue, yellow, red
Color is no criteria.

1847
02:14:39,840 --> 02:14:41,040
It is said to be just an identity.

1848
02:14:41,640 --> 02:14:43,580
But its true identity is,

1849
02:14:43,640 --> 02:14:45,410
duty, decorum, discipline,

1850
02:14:45,480 --> 02:14:47,780
justice, integrity, heroism.

1851
02:14:48,350 --> 02:14:50,680
Our country with its share
of corruption, hypocrisy,

1852
02:14:50,750 --> 02:14:53,520
religious fanaticism, caste fury and
a frenzy for power and authority.

1853
02:14:53,590 --> 02:14:55,960
With all these stains of
stigmas and smudges,

1854
02:14:56,160 --> 02:14:57,930
it became very difficult to retain
the whiteness on the uniforms.

1855
02:14:58,790 --> 02:15:00,190
Then a spark of insight flared up

1856
02:15:01,100 --> 02:15:02,830
and a color was mixed with white.

1857
02:15:03,900 --> 02:15:05,230
That is khaki.

1858
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:08,970
Even if we wear a khaki uniform,

1859
02:15:09,040 --> 02:15:11,440
we should never forget
our heart within is pure white.

1860
02:15:11,740 --> 02:15:13,940
And no policeman should forget this.

1861
02:15:14,910 --> 02:15:16,180
And if we do,

1862
02:15:16,740 --> 02:15:19,180
there's no difference
between criminals and us.
