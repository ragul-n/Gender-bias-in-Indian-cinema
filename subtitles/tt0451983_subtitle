84
00:10:02,815 --> 00:10:04,749

You bored us, Siddharth.

87
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:14,285
These media guys..

88
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,828
Why are they talking about
your success repeatedly?

89
00:10:18,298 --> 00:10:19,765
Have you bribed them?

90
00:10:22,302 --> 00:10:23,963
Do you think that
everyone is like you?

91
00:10:25,939 --> 00:10:27,099
Or are you jealous, Sean?

92
00:10:28,174 --> 00:10:30,768
You had gone to Dubai.
When did you come back?

93
00:10:32,178 --> 00:10:33,270

00:12:29,062 --> 00:12:30,154
Did l order this?

00:12:31,564 --> 00:12:33,088
Can't you do anything right?

123
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:35,426
Can't you do one thing right?

124

l will bash you, Where is your mind?

130
00:12:55,088 --> 00:12:57,921
Our department is involved in
this case since three months.

131
00:12:58,091 --> 00:13:01,925
And the cocaine was
worth more than three crores.

132
00:13:01,994 --> 00:13:04,189
l risked my life and..

133
00:13:05,098 --> 00:13:06,429
Yes.. yes.. yes madam.

Sir got this information
from our local informer.

135
00:13:10,103 --> 00:13:11,934
Would you like to
speak to Mr. Siddharth?

136
00:13:12,338 --> 00:13:14,135
Vinita, from the TV news.

137
00:13:19,345 --> 00:13:21,939
From today.. lf any
person from my department..

138
00:13:22,014 --> 00:13:24,949
..speaks to the media, there
will be no one worse than me.

139
00:13:26,352 --> 00:13:27,444
Do you all understand?

140
00:13:28,454 --> 00:13:30,285
Yes, sir.
- And yes, Kumar.

141
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,958

..give my mobile number. Actually..

143
00:13:38,464 --> 00:13:41,558
Even l wish to become famous.
l want to become a star.

144
00:13:42,301 --> 00:13:45,134
lf girls chase me, my
friend doesn't have any problem.

145
00:13:46,372 --> 00:13:47,566
Siddharth, you don't
have a problem, do you?

146
00:13:48,474 --> 00:13:49,964
Did you keep all the money inside?

147
00:13:50,376 --> 00:13:52,640
The money from the drug raid?

148
00:13:53,246 --> 00:13:54,304
No.

149
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,142
l spent all the
money and the cocaine..

150
00:14:02,388 --> 00:14:03,480
Siddharth..

151
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:06,151
Yes, l have kept them inside.
What else should l do?

152
00:14:06,492 --> 00:14:10,656
lt is a whole 87 lakhs. Count
it and weigh the cocaine too.

153
00:14:11,531 --> 00:14:14,591
What if l have smoked a gram or so?

154
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,330
Siddharth..

155
00:14:19,172 --> 00:14:21,197
Don't think like a
police man for two minutes.

156
00:14:21,507 --> 00:14:22,997
And listen to my plan.

157
00:14:23,409 --> 00:14:26,537
We will take this money and
we will leave for Switzerland.

158
00:14:28,548 --> 00:14:31,176
We will make a log house. We
will flirt with foreigners.

159
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:34,181
We will drink alcohol.
What do you say?

160
00:14:38,424 --> 00:14:40,187
What has happened to
your sense of humor?

161
00:14:41,427 --> 00:14:42,621
There was a time when you laughed..

162
00:14:42,695 --> 00:14:44,560
..at the worst of my jokes. And now..

163
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,427
..l am trying to make you
smile and staging dramas.

164
00:14:46,566 --> 00:14:48,295
You aren't even smiling..

165
00:14:48,434 --> 00:14:51,369
James.. this is a police
station and we are police men.

166
00:14:51,537 --> 00:14:54,028
This isn't a circus that we
will laugh at every small joke.

167
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,368
And understand one more thing.

168
00:14:56,442 --> 00:14:58,034
The next time when l
speak to the force..

169
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:00,044
..don't interrupt me!

170
00:15:02,448 --> 00:15:03,540
Siddharth..

171
00:15:05,451 --> 00:15:07,043
l know you very well.

172
00:15:07,453 --> 00:15:11,048
And l know that you
cannot live without Sonia.

173
00:15:12,225 --> 00:15:13,317
You will die.

174
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:15,049
You cannot bear solitude.

175
00:15:16,062 --> 00:15:17,256
lt's been three months.

176
00:15:17,563 --> 00:15:19,121
Have you seen your state?

177
00:15:25,471 --> 00:15:26,563
Look, friend.

178
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,071
There are just two choices in life.

179
00:15:29,675 --> 00:15:34,078
Either walk where life
teaches you to walk..

180
00:15:34,146 --> 00:15:39,243
..or bring life to that path,
where you want to walk.

181
00:15:40,486 --> 00:15:41,612
You will have to choose.

182
00:15:42,255 --> 00:15:45,747
Do you wish to live with Sonia..
or without her?

183
00:15:48,494 --> 00:15:49,586
Have you finished your speech?

184
00:15:51,597 --> 00:15:53,087
Don't give me a
lecture the next time.

185
00:16:14,287 --> 00:16:16,118
Happy new year.

186
00:16:44,317 --> 00:16:46,148
Sonia, why are these
suitcases in the hall?

187
00:16:56,662 --> 00:16:59,358
These are the keys to the house.
And this is the electricity bill.

188
00:16:59,565 --> 00:17:01,157
l haven't paid it as yet.

189
00:17:02,668 --> 00:17:05,831
Pay it by next month or the
electricity will be disconnected.

190
00:17:07,506 --> 00:17:08,632
Come off it, Sonia.

191
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,175
Don't start the same
bickering once again.

192
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:13,178
lt is twelve in the night.
What is wrong with you?

193
00:17:15,581 --> 00:17:17,173
l have come to my senses.

194
00:17:19,585 --> 00:17:23,180
l am tired of living
this farcical life!

195
00:17:23,789 --> 00:17:25,848
l don't want your alms.

196
00:17:26,792 --> 00:17:30,193
From morning till night,
l wait for the..

197
00:17:30,262 --> 00:17:34,198
..moment when you will come home..

198
00:17:34,266 --> 00:17:38,202
..unlock the door with your key..

199
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:42,604
..and make me feel myself.
l am tired, Siddharth.

200
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:47,374
l want my life back.

201
00:17:50,282 --> 00:17:51,544
You are having a fit
once again, isn't it?

202
00:17:52,752 --> 00:17:55,220
Now you will tell me
all through the night..

203
00:17:55,287 --> 00:17:57,221
..about the great
sacrifice you did by marrying me.

204
00:17:58,224 --> 00:18:00,215
And you will show me that l should..

205
00:18:00,292 --> 00:18:02,226
..be grateful to you, because you..

206
00:18:02,294 --> 00:18:04,387
..left your police job,
and looked after this house.

207
00:18:06,632 --> 00:18:07,724
Why, Sonia?

208
00:18:09,402 --> 00:18:11,393
Why are you insulting me
and insulting yourself?

209
00:18:14,306 --> 00:18:15,398
Go.

210
00:18:15,508 --> 00:18:17,237
Stop this fighting and
go upstairs and sleep.

211
00:18:17,643 --> 00:18:19,406
We have our whole life
to fight and bicker.

212
00:18:20,446 --> 00:18:22,243
And as it is, even if you wish to..

213
00:18:22,314 --> 00:18:24,248
..you cannot go back to your
police job at such a stage.

214
00:18:25,518 --> 00:18:27,247
Damn it, Sonia! You are pregnant.

215
00:18:27,753 --> 00:18:31,416
You are pregnant. Grow up.

216
00:18:33,926 --> 00:18:36,258
You have become blind, Siddharth.

217
00:18:37,763 --> 00:18:40,789
Haven't you seen my state
since the past few days?

218
00:18:41,767 --> 00:18:43,257
What has happened to you?

219
00:18:45,671 --> 00:18:48,765
Siddharth, l have had an abortion.

220
00:18:56,782 --> 00:18:57,874
Abortion?

221
00:18:58,751 --> 00:19:01,618
Yes. Abortion.

222
00:19:03,689 --> 00:19:05,452
And you are the reason behind this.

223
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:07,751
l knew it.

224
00:19:07,827 --> 00:19:09,818
You wanted to make me
the mother of your child..

225
00:19:09,895 --> 00:19:11,886
..and take away my
share of the freedom!

226
00:19:12,898 --> 00:19:14,627
You wanted to turn
my innocent child..

227
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,634
..into a security
guard of this house..

228
00:19:16,702 --> 00:19:18,897
..and make me a
captive in this house.

229
00:19:22,508 --> 00:19:24,305
Therefore, l killed my child.

230
00:19:25,811 --> 00:19:27,301
l killed my own child.

231
00:19:27,713 --> 00:19:29,647
And you are the reason for that.

232
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,477
l killed my own child..

233
00:19:36,722 --> 00:19:37,814
Get lost from here!

234
00:19:42,495 --> 00:19:45,396
Get out from my house!
Get out from my house!

235
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,660
Leave right now!

236
00:19:57,743 --> 00:19:58,835
Get out!

237
00:19:59,879 --> 00:20:00,937
Get out!

238
00:20:01,847 --> 00:20:03,337
Just get out!

239
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,676
l am going out.

240
00:20:05,751 --> 00:20:08,515
By the time l come back,
l don't want you here.

241
00:20:27,706 --> 00:20:29,367
Hello? - This is
Anna here, Siddharth.

242
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,365
Can you come over to my house?

243
00:20:31,777 --> 00:20:33,369
l think that someone
has barged into my house.

244
00:20:33,712 --> 00:20:34,906
l will be there right away.

245
00:21:06,078 --> 00:21:07,409
Mrs. Verghese.

246
00:21:31,036 --> 00:21:32,435
He has escaped, Officer.

247
00:21:38,611 --> 00:21:39,771
Mrs. Verghese, you..

248
00:21:41,947 --> 00:21:43,039
Are you okay?

249
00:21:43,849 --> 00:21:44,941
l am all right.

250
00:21:49,855 --> 00:21:51,618
l am sorry l had to call
you like this at such a time.

251
00:21:52,992 --> 00:21:54,960
Sean has gone to Bombay on some work.

252
00:21:57,129 --> 00:21:59,461
And l don't know
anyone else in this city.

253
00:21:59,865 --> 00:22:00,991
lt's okay.

254
00:22:02,468 --> 00:22:03,628
But what was the matter?

255
00:22:04,003 --> 00:22:06,995
l was sleeping in that
room when l heard some voices.

256
00:22:08,874 --> 00:22:11,638
When l came in and looked around..
This window was open.

257
00:22:13,879 --> 00:22:17,474
When l went to shut it,
he was standing behind me.

258
00:22:17,883 --> 00:22:19,009
Just like you.

259
00:22:19,952 --> 00:22:21,476
What happened after that?

260
00:22:31,096 --> 00:22:32,825
Then he held me like this.

261
00:22:39,905 --> 00:22:41,031
No one came here, isn't it?

262
00:22:42,908 --> 00:22:44,000
No.

263
00:26:08,881 --> 00:26:10,712
Hello?

264
00:26:11,884 --> 00:26:13,715
Hello?

265
00:26:19,057 --> 00:26:20,718
Hello?

266
00:26:43,815 --> 00:26:45,009
This is the state around here, sir..

267
00:26:45,083 --> 00:26:46,243
Hockey players are
made to play football.

268
00:26:46,318 --> 00:26:48,286
Whose car is parked outside?
- Sir..

269
00:26:48,353 --> 00:26:49,752
Whose car is parked outside?

270
00:26:49,922 --> 00:26:51,355
Mr. Dixit..

271
00:26:53,258 --> 00:26:55,158
Where is he?
- lnside..

272
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,750
l made him sit inside your cabin.

273
00:26:59,097 --> 00:27:00,257
What is he doing there?

274
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,268
Sir..
- What is he doing in my cabin?

275
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:07,101
Sir.. there was no other place..
- Make him sit outside..

276
00:27:24,189 --> 00:27:26,316
lt is very hot in Goa today.

277
00:27:29,194 --> 00:27:30,786
Have you come here to
speak about the weather?

278
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:34,789
This is what l like about you.

279
00:27:36,335 --> 00:27:38,803
You always come directly
to the crux of the matter.

280
00:27:40,205 --> 00:27:41,968
The matter is.. Officer Mehra.

281
00:27:42,207 --> 00:27:43,401
l am Carl's lawyer.

282
00:27:43,976 --> 00:27:46,968
The one who you
arrested in the drug raid.

283
00:27:48,146 --> 00:27:49,306
So?

284
00:27:49,982 --> 00:27:51,973
The case will just go on.

285
00:27:53,318 --> 00:27:54,808
lt will go on for many days.

286
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:58,155
You know our legal system.

287
00:27:58,991 --> 00:28:00,424
But that cocaine..

288
00:28:00,492 --> 00:28:04,485
Which is in your custody,
l came to talk about that.

289
00:28:05,998 --> 00:28:07,829
Yes, there is some money too.

290
00:28:08,033 --> 00:28:09,830
But we don't care about it.

291
00:28:10,235 --> 00:28:14,001
Nobody knows the exact amount
of the money and the cocaine.

292
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:19,367
Keep some cocaine to show
the others and return the rest.

293
00:28:20,379 --> 00:28:23,507
And keep the money as
a reward from our side.

294
00:28:27,252 --> 00:28:29,379
Let go of my collar!
- Will you bribe me?

295
00:28:29,521 --> 00:28:30,852
Let go of my collar!

296
00:28:30,922 --> 00:28:33,254
Get lost from here!
- Let go of my collar!

297
00:28:35,027 --> 00:28:36,187
Are you mad?

298
00:28:36,261 --> 00:28:37,853
l will have you suspended.
l will not spare you.

299
00:28:37,929 --> 00:28:39,191
Get lost from here!

300
00:28:40,265 --> 00:28:41,357
Enough!

301
00:28:41,933 --> 00:28:43,025
What's wrong with you?

302
00:28:44,269 --> 00:28:46,203
Was some one bribing you
for the first time in life?

303
00:28:47,372 --> 00:28:48,862
What has happened to you nowadays?

304
00:28:51,276 --> 00:28:52,868
Get a hold on yourself.

305
00:28:56,214 --> 00:28:57,374
Sid..

306
00:29:00,485 --> 00:29:03,386
No, James. l will not go back to him.

307
00:29:05,057 --> 00:29:06,217
He doesn't want a woman.

308
00:29:06,391 --> 00:29:08,086
He wants a doormat.

309
00:29:09,294 --> 00:29:11,888
He cannot tolerate
the equality of women.

310
00:29:14,099 --> 00:29:17,432
Whether he likes it or not,
l have started working.

311
00:29:19,071 --> 00:29:20,902
l cannot sacrifice
my identity anymore.

312
00:29:24,076 --> 00:29:25,236
l waited a lot.

313
00:29:26,445 --> 00:29:28,504
l sat on the footpath for two hours.

314
00:29:29,448 --> 00:29:33,179
That he will come and take me home.

315
00:29:35,454 --> 00:29:37,422
But he didn't come, James.

316
00:29:38,323 --> 00:29:39,915
He didn't come.

317
00:29:44,463 --> 00:29:45,930
Now, you take care of him.

318
00:29:50,335 --> 00:29:51,927
l cannot insult myself any longer.

319
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,101
l will not go back to him.

320
00:30:01,346 --> 00:30:03,940
Me.. me.. me..

321
00:30:05,617 --> 00:30:08,142
This me is always alone, Sonia.

322
00:30:10,555 --> 00:30:13,285
You will not go to call him,
he will not come to take you.

323
00:30:14,493 --> 00:30:16,154
l am scared, Sonia.

324
00:30:17,562 --> 00:30:19,496
There can be some major problems.

325
00:30:40,385 --> 00:30:42,376
The way you left me that night.

326
00:30:44,055 --> 00:30:45,989
l didn't think that we
will ever meet again.

327
00:30:51,396 --> 00:30:52,488
Thanks for calling.

328
00:30:59,404 --> 00:31:01,338
Anna, whatever happened
between us that night.

329
00:31:03,341 --> 00:31:04,501
lt wasn't proper.

330
00:31:06,411 --> 00:31:08,003
And l am ashamed of it.

331
00:31:10,615 --> 00:31:12,344
After today, we will never meet.

332
00:31:14,619 --> 00:31:16,018
l am sorry about what happened.

333
00:32:29,261 --> 00:32:35,097
lf l get your company, l
will leave this world..

334
00:32:41,506 --> 00:32:46,637
lf l get your company, l
will leave this world..

335
00:32:47,312 --> 00:32:52,716
lf l get your company, l
will leave this world..

336
00:32:53,285 --> 00:32:58,780
Being with you, l will
break all ties with the world.

337
00:32:59,291 --> 00:33:05,127
lf you promise to be with me..
l will leave this world.

338
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:11,291
lf you promise to be with me..
l will leave this world.

339
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:44,666
Without you, l will not
see anything splendid.

340
00:33:50,642 --> 00:33:56,706
Without you, l will not
see anything splendid.

341
00:33:56,848 --> 00:34:02,787
What you don't like,
l won't see it again.

342
00:34:03,388 --> 00:34:08,189
The mirror that
doesn't yield your face..

343
00:34:09,394 --> 00:34:12,192
The mirror that
doesn't yield your face..

344
00:34:12,263 --> 00:34:14,731
l will break that mirror.

345
00:34:15,367 --> 00:34:21,465
lf you promise to be with me..
l will leave this world.

346
00:34:51,636 --> 00:34:53,570
You love her a lot still, isn't it?

347
00:35:11,656 --> 00:35:17,424
l will settle you in my
body and soul in such a way..

348
00:35:23,668 --> 00:35:29,436
l will settle you in my
body and soul in such a way..

349
00:35:29,674 --> 00:35:35,442
l will turn your aroma
in to my body's aroma.

350
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,275
l will settle such a relationship..

351
00:35:41,786 --> 00:35:44,277
l will settle such a relationship..

352
00:35:44,355 --> 00:35:47,620
Even sadness won't make
any difference to it.

353
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:53,796
lf you promise to be with me..
l will leave this world.

354
00:35:53,898 --> 00:35:59,632
Being with you, l will
break all ties with the world.

355
00:35:59,904 --> 00:36:05,706
lf you promise to be with me..
l will leave this world.

356
00:36:05,844 --> 00:36:11,805
lf you promise to be with me..
l will leave this world.

357
00:36:25,663 --> 00:36:26,823
Hello?

358
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:32,928
Yes, doctor?

359
00:36:38,877 --> 00:36:39,935
For what?

360
00:36:41,846 --> 00:36:43,336
Yes, okay, doctor.

361
00:36:48,353 --> 00:36:49,684
Anna, what happened?

362
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:52,948
Nothing.

363
00:36:53,858 --> 00:36:55,348
Anna, what happened?

364
00:36:57,862 --> 00:36:59,352
l am pregnant.

365
00:37:04,903 --> 00:37:06,370
Don't worry, Siddharth.

366
00:37:08,773 --> 00:37:11,537
This matter will be our
secret till my last breath.

367
00:37:14,913 --> 00:37:17,381
How can you say that..
- What?

368
00:37:19,584 --> 00:37:22,382
How can you say
that this is my child?

369
00:37:22,921 --> 00:37:25,389
Because l have not had any physical..

370
00:37:25,456 --> 00:37:27,583
..relationship with my
husband since many years.

371
00:37:34,566 --> 00:37:36,397
Can you come with me to the hospital?

372
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:45,072
Yes..
- Hello, doctor.

373
00:37:45,143 --> 00:37:46,610
Hi..
- l will call you back.

374
00:37:47,812 --> 00:37:50,747
Doctor Khanna, this is Siddharth.
- Hi.

375
00:37:51,583 --> 00:37:53,574
ls he your friend?
- Yes.

376
00:37:53,685 --> 00:37:55,414
Please have a seat.

377
00:37:55,954 --> 00:37:57,421
l am sorry, doctor.

378
00:37:57,589 --> 00:37:59,614
You had to come here
for my work on a holiday.

379
00:37:59,824 --> 00:38:02,418
No problem. Don't be silly.

380
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:06,761
Your reports have arrived.

381
00:38:06,965 --> 00:38:08,694
The tests have resulted positive.

382
00:38:11,603 --> 00:38:12,763
You are pregnant.

383
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:19,440
But l haven't called you
to tell you just this.

384
00:38:21,846 --> 00:38:22,938
Anna..

385
00:38:23,982 --> 00:38:25,449
Your cancer has returned.

386
00:38:33,057 --> 00:38:34,615
Don't worry, Anna.

387
00:38:34,726 --> 00:38:36,455
You can be cured.

388
00:38:36,527 --> 00:38:38,461
There is a hospital in Mumbai.

389
00:38:38,529 --> 00:38:40,793
l will try to have
you admitted there.

390
00:38:42,867 --> 00:38:44,528
You can be cured by them.

391
00:38:45,737 --> 00:38:48,137
Forty percent people who go
there get saved, isn't it?

392
00:38:48,206 --> 00:38:49,798
How much time do l have, doctor?

393
00:38:51,009 --> 00:38:53,136
Anna, there is nothing
to be worried in this..

394
00:38:53,211 --> 00:38:55,076
How much time do l have, doctor?

395
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:00,481
Three months.

396
00:39:05,657 --> 00:39:07,989
Thank you.
- Anna..

397
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,491
Anna.. Listen.. Anna..

398
00:39:14,999 --> 00:39:16,091
Excuse me..

399
00:39:17,702 --> 00:39:19,499
You are Anna's friend,
maybe you can..

400
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:21,504
..convince her about this better.

401
00:39:21,906 --> 00:39:23,498
She can be cured by treatment.

402
00:39:24,909 --> 00:39:26,035
l mean..

403
00:39:26,911 --> 00:39:28,037
Just a minute.

404
00:39:32,583 --> 00:39:34,517
The hospital that l
am talking about..

405
00:39:34,585 --> 00:39:36,519
..a lot of treatments go on there.

406
00:39:36,921 --> 00:39:40,914
Like automated procedures,
metallurgical vaccines..

407
00:39:40,992 --> 00:39:42,516
And.. Hyperthermia.

408
00:39:44,028 --> 00:39:45,120
Here..

409
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:48,694
All these treatments are very costly.

410
00:39:48,933 --> 00:39:50,195
There is no guarantee..

411
00:39:50,268 --> 00:39:53,863
But we don't have any other way too.

412
00:39:56,941 --> 00:39:58,033
Thank you.

413
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:07,008
Anna..

414
00:40:07,085 --> 00:40:08,882
The doctor was speaking
about the Mumbai hospital.

415
00:40:09,954 --> 00:40:11,945
He was saying that you
can be admitted there.

416
00:40:15,093 --> 00:40:16,151
Siddharth..

417
00:40:17,061 --> 00:40:18,892
We will not meet after today.

418
00:40:20,098 --> 00:40:22,157
l don't want to share
my problems with you.

419
00:40:23,234 --> 00:40:24,565
Good bye, Siddharth.

420
00:40:29,107 --> 00:40:30,574
Anna..

421
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:34,571
Anna.. Listen to me, Anna.

422
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,572
Anna, listen to me..

423
00:40:37,982 --> 00:40:39,108
Listen to me..

424
00:40:41,753 --> 00:40:43,084
What do you think l am?

425
00:40:44,589 --> 00:40:46,580
Just that man who
slept with you in your bed?

426
00:40:47,759 --> 00:40:48,919
Who will just reject you?

427
00:40:48,993 --> 00:40:50,585
When he knows that you are dying?

428
00:40:51,095 --> 00:40:52,756
What will you do then?

429
00:40:54,999 --> 00:40:56,591
Will you save me from death?

430
00:40:58,202 --> 00:40:59,931
You will give me a new life?

431
00:41:02,206 --> 00:41:04,606
My cure is not in
your hands, Siddharth.

432
00:41:07,011 --> 00:41:09,138
And neither can you fulfil
my desire of motherhood.

433
00:41:15,219 --> 00:41:16,618
Open the door, Anna.

434
00:41:18,022 --> 00:41:19,148
Anna, open the door.

435
00:41:20,024 --> 00:41:21,753
Sean has come, you go away from here.

436
00:41:21,826 --> 00:41:23,020
Anna.. - Let him come, l
will talk to him. - Siddharth..

437
00:41:23,094 --> 00:41:25,085
What will you speak to him? You
don't need to fall in these problems.

438
00:41:25,163 --> 00:41:27,028
Anna, this is about your life,
l want to meet him.

439
00:41:27,131 --> 00:41:30,623
Go.. please go..
- Anna..

440
00:41:35,807 --> 00:41:37,638
Open the door, Anna.
Where are you? Anna..

441
00:41:43,815 --> 00:41:45,646
Why did it take so
long to open the door?

442
00:41:45,817 --> 00:41:47,648
Sean, l was in that room.

443
00:41:50,154 --> 00:41:51,815
l heard some male voice from here.

444
00:41:53,191 --> 00:41:56,319
Who was he? Who was he, Anna?

445
00:41:57,061 --> 00:41:59,188
Sean.. you must have heard the TV.

446
00:41:59,263 --> 00:42:01,163
Shut up..
- lt must be the TV. - Shut up..

447
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:14,671
How was your
appointment with the doctor?

448
00:42:15,279 --> 00:42:16,871
l didn't have any
appointment with the doctor.

449
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:19,149
Then why did Kunal call
me from the hospital..

450
00:42:19,217 --> 00:42:21,276
..and say that he has seen you there?

451
00:42:22,854 --> 00:42:25,288
And there was some man with you too.

452
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:28,024
Who was he?
- He was my friend.

453
00:42:28,226 --> 00:42:30,854
Okay. So now you say that
you went to the hospital.

454
00:42:31,195 --> 00:42:32,287
Sean, please..
- You are lying.

455
00:42:32,363 --> 00:42:33,887
You are lying.. Anna..

456
00:42:33,965 --> 00:42:35,694
You lie to me?

457
00:42:36,033 --> 00:42:37,694
Don't lie to me.

458
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:40,030
Don't you ever lie to me..

459
00:42:43,875 --> 00:42:45,240
Anna.. Anna.

460
00:42:47,111 --> 00:42:49,045
Open the door, police. - Get lost,
there is nobody in the house.

461
00:42:49,313 --> 00:42:50,712
Open the door, police.

462
00:42:54,051 --> 00:42:55,211
Hello, Sean.

463
00:42:55,887 --> 00:42:58,117
What? What?

464
00:42:58,322 --> 00:43:01,382
l was passing from here.
l heard some voices.

465
00:43:03,127 --> 00:43:04,719
ls your wife all right?

466
00:43:06,397 --> 00:43:07,728
Officer..

467
00:43:09,133 --> 00:43:10,225
This is my house.

468
00:43:10,801 --> 00:43:13,736
Whatever happens inside..
is our personal matter.

469
00:43:15,139 --> 00:43:16,936
You can leave.

470
00:43:19,243 --> 00:43:21,268
Hitting your wife is a legal matter.

471
00:43:21,913 --> 00:43:23,141
Not your personal matter.

472
00:43:23,247 --> 00:43:24,737
Call Anna outside.

473
00:43:24,916 --> 00:43:26,144
Anna doesn't want to meet you.

474
00:43:27,018 --> 00:43:29,816
Call Anna out, or l will
lock you and hit you so much..

475
00:43:31,155 --> 00:43:32,281
What is the matter, officer?

476
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:36,285
Are you all right?

477
00:43:38,296 --> 00:43:39,763
l am all right.

478
00:43:42,166 --> 00:43:43,758
Come on, Sean. Come inside.

479
00:43:57,181 --> 00:43:58,273
l am pregnant.

480
00:43:59,183 --> 00:44:01,777
My cure is not in
your hands, Siddharth.

481
00:44:01,852 --> 00:44:04,320
And neither can you fulfil
my desire of motherhood.

482
00:44:05,957 --> 00:44:07,117
Don't lie to me..

483
00:44:07,191 --> 00:44:08,317
Don't you ever lie to me..

484
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,394
Are you lying to me?
- Sean, please don't hit me.

485
00:44:31,215 --> 00:44:33,410
Hi.
- Hi.

486
00:44:36,354 --> 00:44:37,412
You here?

487
00:44:39,223 --> 00:44:40,417
Yes, l wanted to meet you.

488
00:44:43,227 --> 00:44:44,819
Why are you sitting outside?

489
00:44:44,996 --> 00:44:46,156
Come.

490
00:44:52,303 --> 00:44:53,361
Have a seat.

491
00:45:12,356 --> 00:45:15,382
Don't be so happy. The house is
not like this most of the times.

492
00:45:17,028 --> 00:45:19,861
Actually, after you left,
Sharda left the job.

493
00:45:20,398 --> 00:45:22,263
And you know how busy l am.

494
00:45:23,134 --> 00:45:24,863
Shall l send another house cleaner?

495
00:45:25,403 --> 00:45:27,064
No. that is not needed.

496
00:45:32,276 --> 00:45:33,868
What happened to your hand?

497
00:45:35,279 --> 00:45:38,407
l was hurt while
cleaning the kitchen.

498
00:45:38,482 --> 00:45:40,143
Wait, l will bring the medicine.

499
00:45:55,066 --> 00:45:56,897
Siddharth, it must be
in the lower drawer.

500
00:45:57,068 --> 00:45:58,228
Yes, l know.

501
00:46:18,422 --> 00:46:19,514
What are you doing?

502
00:46:24,328 --> 00:46:26,421
The old habits don't go so easily.

503
00:46:30,101 --> 00:46:32,433
Let it be, l will do it.
Give me your hand.

504
00:46:41,278 --> 00:46:42,540
Why did you come here?

505
00:46:45,449 --> 00:46:48,282
That. l wanted your signatures.

506
00:47:00,364 --> 00:47:01,456
That..

507
00:47:01,532 --> 00:47:03,159
l want to apply for
a loan in the bank.

508
00:47:03,367 --> 00:47:05,961
l just wanted to
show that l live alone.

509
00:47:06,137 --> 00:47:08,469
Like that..
- You don't have to tell me anything.

510
00:47:10,508 --> 00:47:11,566
Pen.

511
00:47:14,378 --> 00:47:15,504
l don't have a pen.

512
00:47:15,579 --> 00:47:16,978
lf you can bring the divorce papers..

513
00:47:17,047 --> 00:47:18,309
..you can bring the pen too.

514
00:47:25,156 --> 00:47:26,316
At least pick up the phone.

515
00:47:31,595 --> 00:47:34,393
Hello, Siddharth. l am
calling since so long.

516
00:47:34,465 --> 00:47:36,160
Were you busy?
- Please hold on.

517
00:47:39,403 --> 00:47:40,495
Who is it?

518
00:47:47,511 --> 00:47:49,672
Hello?
- Siddharth, l am Anna here.

519
00:47:50,414 --> 00:47:52,006
Did l call at a wrong time?

520
00:47:53,350 --> 00:48:00,552
No..
- Sonia..

521
00:48:12,436 --> 00:48:14,301
Hello, Siddharth. hello.

522
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:18,508
Hello, Anna.
- What is the matter, Siddharth?

523
00:48:18,576 --> 00:48:20,043
ls everything all right?

524
00:48:20,444 --> 00:48:22,036
Should l call you later?

525
00:48:22,112 --> 00:48:25,377
No, it is all right.
Tell me, what is the matter?

526
00:48:25,583 --> 00:48:27,380
Siddharth, l think that the money..

527
00:48:27,451 --> 00:48:29,578
..for the operation will be arranged.

528
00:48:31,455 --> 00:48:32,547
How?

529
00:48:33,591 --> 00:48:36,059
Not me.. You will have to
make the bank a beneficiary.

530
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:40,658
And in the new scheme, we will give
you the loan on your life insurance.

531
00:48:41,265 --> 00:48:43,062
But the interest
will be twelve percent.

532
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:48,401
How much loan will l
get on this policy?

533
00:49:07,625 --> 00:49:11,493
Sean..
- Hey, Joe.. how are you? - Nice..

534
00:49:15,266 --> 00:49:16,358
What is the matter?

535
00:49:16,433 --> 00:49:17,627
Yadav was telling me that you are..

536
00:49:17,701 --> 00:49:19,635
..buying some hotel or
night club in Dubai?

537
00:49:19,703 --> 00:49:21,637
From where did you get so much money?

538
00:49:22,439 --> 00:49:24,100
Think that l hit some jackpot.

539
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:27,704
Jack pot.

540
00:49:29,513 --> 00:49:30,639
What is the matter, Anna?

541
00:49:31,649 --> 00:49:32,707
What is the problem?

542
00:49:34,451 --> 00:49:35,611
Anna, why don't you tell me?

543
00:49:36,654 --> 00:49:37,712
Anna..

544
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:40,450
The bank says that l cannot get..

545
00:49:40,524 --> 00:49:42,116
..the loan for the next six months.

546
00:49:42,526 --> 00:49:45,723
Six months? Why? Can it
not be done before that?

547
00:49:47,531 --> 00:49:49,658
No. it is a government rule.

548
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,462
And we cannot do anything about it.

549
00:49:52,536 --> 00:49:54,731
Anna, we can try in some other bank.

550
00:49:55,306 --> 00:49:58,139
Maybe the manager here..
- You cannot do anything, Siddharth.

551
00:49:59,643 --> 00:50:00,735
l am dying.

552
00:50:05,549 --> 00:50:07,141
Anna.. listen to me..

553
00:50:07,318 --> 00:50:09,752
Siddharth, please go away from here.

554
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:11,482
You shouldn't be here.

555
00:50:11,655 --> 00:50:13,816
Anna..
- Siddharth, please..

556
00:50:14,325 --> 00:50:15,656
Anna, l can help you.

557
00:50:18,562 --> 00:50:20,154
Siddharth, please go!

558
00:50:21,231 --> 00:50:22,493
Go away from here..

559
00:50:30,341 --> 00:50:31,672
You cannot do anything, Siddharth.

560
00:50:32,576 --> 00:50:33,702
l am dying.

561
00:50:44,588 --> 00:50:50,185
Sir, shall l leave?
- Yes, go.

562
00:51:35,739 --> 00:51:36,831
What is this?

563
00:51:37,641 --> 00:51:40,405
l am making you the beneficiary
of my life insurance policy.

564
00:51:44,648 --> 00:51:45,774
l don't want it.

565
00:51:46,784 --> 00:51:48,251
You will have to take it, Siddharth.

566
00:51:49,753 --> 00:51:51,516
l am leaving this city.

567
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:53,848
Where?

568
00:51:54,925 --> 00:51:56,256
l don't know.

569
00:51:57,661 --> 00:51:58,855
Far away from this city.

570
00:51:59,797 --> 00:52:01,264
Away from Sean.

571
00:52:03,667 --> 00:52:06,261
Where l can spend the rest
of my life in your memories.

572
00:52:08,672 --> 00:52:09,866
Anna, l cannot do this.

573
00:52:11,675 --> 00:52:13,267
You will have to do it, Siddharth.

574
00:52:14,678 --> 00:52:16,270
l don't tell you to love me.

575
00:52:17,481 --> 00:52:19,540
And you cannot stop
yourself from loving me.

576
00:52:23,454 --> 00:52:25,445
Do you know what the
tragedy of our life is?

577
00:52:25,689 --> 00:52:27,452
l love you.

578
00:52:28,692 --> 00:52:30,284
But you don't love me.

579
00:52:31,695 --> 00:52:33,560
You love such a girl..

580
00:52:34,465 --> 00:52:36,626
Who has walked away from you.

581
00:52:39,703 --> 00:52:41,694
What do you mean?
- Don't be a fool Siddharth.

582
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,468
Go to the Marriot today
and see what's going on.

583
00:53:18,742 --> 00:53:24,874
You don't know..

584
00:53:24,948 --> 00:53:31,512
You don't know..

585
00:53:38,762 --> 00:53:44,758
You don't know..

586
00:53:44,902 --> 00:53:51,637
You don't know..

587
00:53:52,609 --> 00:53:55,703
My heart yearns in your love.

588
00:53:58,715 --> 00:54:02,048
lt misses you and prays for you.

589
00:54:02,119 --> 00:54:03,381
You don't know..

590
00:54:03,453 --> 00:54:04,886
You don't know..

591
00:54:04,955 --> 00:54:08,391
My heart yearns in your love.

592
00:54:08,458 --> 00:54:12,724
lt misses you and prays for you.

593
00:54:12,796 --> 00:54:15,390
Look at me with love sometimes too.

594
00:54:15,465 --> 00:54:17,729
Just once..

595
00:54:17,801 --> 00:54:19,735
You don't know..

596
00:54:19,803 --> 00:54:23,739
You don't know..

597
00:54:23,807 --> 00:54:27,903
You don't know..

598
00:55:12,789 --> 00:55:21,925
What do you know about the
craze l have for you in my heart?

599
00:55:22,065 --> 00:55:31,463
l don't have peace to
wait and think about me.

600
00:55:31,808 --> 00:55:35,471
l live but l don't live too.

601
00:55:35,545 --> 00:55:38,571
l die but l don't die too.

602
00:55:38,649 --> 00:55:44,918
To ruin myself in a moment,
l drink poison.

603
00:55:44,988 --> 00:55:47,479
You don't know..

604
00:55:47,557 --> 00:55:51,493
You don't know..

605
00:55:51,561 --> 00:55:58,831
You don't know..

606
00:56:16,687 --> 00:56:20,020
Here is wishing Mr. and Mrs.
Bothello a very happy anniversary.

607
00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:23,184
Ladies and Gentlemen:
let's give them a big hand!

608
00:56:32,202 --> 00:56:41,873
l had a pain in my heart, l
saw you and it emerged out.

609
00:56:42,212 --> 00:56:51,712
No salve could fulfill the
wound of your separation.

610
00:56:52,055 --> 00:56:58,722
Love dances in my breast, and
there is a pain in my eyes.

611
00:56:58,795 --> 00:57:04,893
Every wave of love
hits me like a bank.

612
00:57:31,762 --> 00:57:33,923
Cheers, everybody.

613
00:57:44,107 --> 00:57:45,597
What happened?

614
00:57:58,121 --> 00:57:59,281
Hello?

615
00:57:59,356 --> 00:58:01,119
Anna, meet me in the
police station right now.

616
00:58:01,191 --> 00:58:03,284
l am waiting for you.

617
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:06,261
Siddharth.. l cannot meet you.

618
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:07,961
My flight..

619
00:58:08,031 --> 00:58:09,828
Don't argue. Do what l tell you to!

620
00:58:37,994 --> 00:58:39,655
What happened, Siddharth?

621
00:58:41,665 --> 00:58:43,155
Here.

622
00:58:44,668 --> 00:58:46,260
What is this?

623
00:58:47,337 --> 00:58:48,668
For your cure.

624
00:58:53,844 --> 00:58:56,005
How did you get so much money?

625
00:59:00,183 --> 00:59:01,673
ls this the money from the drug raid?

626
00:59:01,751 --> 00:59:04,083
Yes. But what
difference does it make?

627
00:59:04,154 --> 00:59:05,678
Anna, this money is in my custody.

628
00:59:05,755 --> 00:59:07,689
Nobody knows about this.

629
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:10,690
l cannot take this money, Siddharth.

630
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,193
Anna, you will have
to keep this money.

631
00:59:12,262 --> 00:59:14,196
Carl's case will go on.

632
00:59:14,264 --> 00:59:16,198
And this money will
keep rotting in the safe.

633
00:59:18,201 --> 00:59:19,429
And if anyone asks for
the money in between?

634
00:59:19,502 --> 00:59:20,696
Then l will sell the
house and give the money.

635
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:26,372
l cannot take this money..

636
00:59:26,443 --> 00:59:27,876
Anna, you will have
to take this money.

637
00:59:28,712 --> 00:59:30,703
You will have to stay alive.

638
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:34,716
For me. For you. For our child.

639
00:59:35,719 --> 00:59:37,710
Anna, l have seen a lot.

640
00:59:38,889 --> 00:59:41,221
l want to change
everything that is wrong.

641
00:59:42,959 --> 00:59:45,223
l want to try to start
a new life with you.

642
00:59:49,232 --> 00:59:52,224
No, Siddharth.
- l don't want to listen to anything.

643
00:59:53,270 --> 00:59:55,397
We are going to Bombay for your cure.

644
00:59:55,906 --> 00:59:57,737
The flight is at two in the night.

645
00:59:57,807 --> 00:59:59,741
l am reaching your
house at eleven thirty.

646
01:00:00,744 --> 01:00:02,234
Okay?

647
01:00:22,098 --> 01:00:24,259
Hey.. there is no
opener in your house too?

648
01:00:27,170 --> 01:00:29,104
This is a house, not a beer bar.

649
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:31,931
Sorry..

650
01:00:32,108 --> 01:00:36,101
By the way, where were you till now?

651
01:00:36,179 --> 01:00:38,443
ln the police station.

652
01:00:38,515 --> 01:00:46,945
Police station? At this time?
- Yes.

653
01:00:47,791 --> 01:00:49,782
Where are you going?

654
01:00:49,859 --> 01:00:52,293
Please sit, l want to talk to you.

655
01:00:52,362 --> 01:00:54,796
James..
- You are a good man, Siddharth.

656
01:00:54,864 --> 01:00:57,298
Sit, men..
Siddharth. He is a good man!

657
01:01:01,137 --> 01:01:02,798
See, Siddharth.

658
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:06,301
This maths of love..

659
01:01:06,376 --> 01:01:07,809
Maths..

660
01:01:08,478 --> 01:01:10,139
lt is very strange.

661
01:01:11,982 --> 01:01:18,820
When there is no pride..
then one and one..

662
01:01:18,888 --> 01:01:25,157
..is not two, it is one. And when..

663
01:01:25,228 --> 01:01:30,165
..there is pride, if you remove one..

664
01:01:31,001 --> 01:01:35,335
..then there is no one..
the zero is left.

665
01:01:35,839 --> 01:01:38,831
Zero. And that is you.

666
01:01:39,175 --> 01:01:40,836
Zero.

667
01:01:41,344 --> 01:01:47,510
That's why.. we will go now..

668
01:01:48,018 --> 01:01:51,852
And bring Sonia here.

669
01:01:51,921 --> 01:01:54,355
Right now..

670
01:01:54,858 --> 01:01:56,849
Come on, James.
- What are you doing?

671
01:01:56,926 --> 01:01:58,860
You have drunk a lot. Go home now.

672
01:01:58,928 --> 01:02:01,863
Your childhood friend..
- Go home.

673
01:02:01,931 --> 01:02:03,865
The wife has chucked me too.

674
01:02:03,933 --> 01:02:05,867
See, our friendship..
- James..

675
01:02:08,038 --> 01:02:11,201
Think about what l told you.

676
01:02:11,875 --> 01:02:13,968
Don't do this with Sonia.

677
01:02:15,045 --> 01:02:16,376
Think..

678
01:02:16,446 --> 01:02:18,539
Don't do this with Sonia.

679
01:03:28,118 --> 01:03:29,449
Hello?

680
01:03:29,519 --> 01:03:31,612
Hello. Siddharth, it is James.

681
01:03:31,688 --> 01:03:33,952
Come here quickly.
There is a fire here.

682
01:03:34,958 --> 01:03:36,448
Where?

683
01:03:36,526 --> 01:03:38,289
Anna Verghese's house.

684
01:03:39,295 --> 01:03:42,594
How did this fire take hold?
- Kumar, bring more men.

685
01:03:46,136 --> 01:03:48,969
lt's an hour, the fire
brigade hasn't come as yet!

686
01:03:49,038 --> 01:03:50,972
l am calling since when!

687
01:03:52,976 --> 01:03:54,967
Siddharth..

688
01:03:55,979 --> 01:03:57,970
Siddharth..

689
01:04:08,158 --> 01:04:09,989
James..

690
01:04:20,336 --> 01:04:22,497
Are you crazy?

691
01:04:23,173 --> 01:04:25,505
You would have burnt
with those two too.

692
01:04:27,177 --> 01:04:29,008
Sometimes l don't understand.

693
01:04:29,078 --> 01:04:31,512
Who will save yourself from you?

694
01:04:36,352 --> 01:04:38,616
l was so intoxicated,
it is all washed out.

695
01:04:40,023 --> 01:04:43,254
lt is a fire case. But no.

696
01:04:43,326 --> 01:04:45,692
The commissioner is
shouting over the phone.

697
01:04:46,196 --> 01:04:52,032
He says that it is a
terrorist activity.

698
01:04:54,537 --> 01:04:56,528
And you know.. who is the special..

699
01:04:56,606 --> 01:04:59,074
..investigating
officer for this case?

700
01:05:34,443 --> 01:05:36,877
The name of the perished
is Sean and Anna Verghese.

701
01:05:36,946 --> 01:05:40,006
They had come from Dubai
and settled here a month ago.

702
01:05:44,387 --> 01:05:47,618
Okay, call Raj.
- Okay, ma'am.

703
01:05:52,951 --> 01:05:54,441
Hi, James.
- Hi, Sonia.

704
01:05:54,953 --> 01:05:57,922
What do you think? How
did all this happen?

705
01:05:58,022 --> 01:06:01,426
Nothing, James. The gas
cylinder must have burst.

706
01:06:01,526 --> 01:06:02,959
What else?

707
01:06:03,294 --> 01:06:06,286
Does the gas cylinder
burst like this, James?

708
01:06:08,967 --> 01:06:10,958
Madam, did you call me?

709
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:16,274
Raj.

710
01:06:16,374 --> 01:06:17,609
Call the forensic team. l need the..

711
01:06:17,709 --> 01:06:19,577
..results from this
place at the earliest.

712
01:06:19,677 --> 01:06:22,947
l want to finish the
case fast. l want results.

713
01:06:23,047 --> 01:06:25,283
And l will make life hell for you..

714
01:06:25,383 --> 01:06:28,648
..till the time l don't
find out what happened here.

715
01:06:29,154 --> 01:06:31,987
ls that clear?
- l will leave then, James.

716
01:06:33,491 --> 01:06:34,959
My work is done here.

717
01:06:35,059 --> 01:06:37,362
The special team has arrived,
it will do it's work.

718
01:06:37,462 --> 01:06:39,657
Bye.
- Just a minute.

719
01:06:44,169 --> 01:06:46,137
l would like to talk to him alone,
James. - Yeah, sure.

720
01:06:52,410 --> 01:06:55,313
Understand this, Siddharth.

721
01:06:55,413 --> 01:06:57,677
l haven't come here with my own wish.

722
01:06:57,815 --> 01:06:59,651
l have been sent here.

723
01:06:59,751 --> 01:07:01,319
And while you are here, l am not..

724
01:07:01,419 --> 01:07:04,217
..interested in being
stuck in some problem.

725
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:07,522
Especially after yesterday night.

726
01:07:09,027 --> 01:07:11,496
We will have to work
together and we cannot help it.

727
01:07:11,596 --> 01:07:13,029
Because this case is of your office.

728
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:18,533
Then?
- l want to know..

729
01:07:19,037 --> 01:07:24,031
Can we work like two
responsible officers?

730
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:31,309
Like two responsible officers.
Why not?

731
01:07:32,050 --> 01:07:33,685
Good.

732
01:07:33,785 --> 01:07:37,050
Come on. We will go to
the station together.

733
01:07:46,798 --> 01:07:49,562
Did you know Anna or Sean Verghese?

734
01:07:52,070 --> 01:07:54,561
Every other person
knows everyone in Panjim.

735
01:07:57,408 --> 01:08:00,044
What did you know about them?

736
01:08:00,144 --> 01:08:02,078
Nothing special.

737
01:08:03,748 --> 01:08:06,050
Did any of the two
have extra marital..

738
01:08:06,150 --> 01:08:08,414
..affairs with anyone else?

739
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:12,215
There is an extra marital
affair in every household nowadays.

740
01:08:14,592 --> 01:08:16,253
You showed your
true colors, isn't it?

741
01:08:19,264 --> 01:08:21,065
lf any woman keeps
calling you at home..

742
01:08:21,165 --> 01:08:22,598
lt is all right.

743
01:08:23,101 --> 01:08:26,070
But if l have dinner
with some old friend..

744
01:08:26,170 --> 01:08:29,105
You become red with rage.

745
01:08:30,608 --> 01:08:33,771
Do you have an idea of what you
did in the party yesterday night?

746
01:08:34,279 --> 01:08:36,338
What did you want to show?

747
01:08:37,448 --> 01:08:40,084
Just that l am an immoral woman.

748
01:08:40,184 --> 01:08:43,381
And how much l torture you.

749
01:08:48,293 --> 01:08:50,124
l am sorry, Siddharth.

750
01:08:51,296 --> 01:08:54,459
We cannot work together. l am sorry.

751
01:08:57,135 --> 01:08:58,436
Sonia..

752
01:08:58,536 --> 01:09:00,572
Sonia, where are you going?
Sit in the car.

753
01:09:00,672 --> 01:09:02,106
lt's okay, Siddharth. l will go.

754
01:09:02,206 --> 01:09:04,108
Sonia, the police
station is too far from here.

755
01:09:04,208 --> 01:09:07,178
Siddharth, l can take care of myself.

756
01:09:07,278 --> 01:09:09,447
You don't need to worry about me.

757
01:09:09,547 --> 01:09:11,139
Sonia, l am sorry.

758
01:09:16,487 --> 01:09:18,887
Sonia, l am sorry.
Sit in the car, please.

759
01:09:20,158 --> 01:09:23,127
See, Siddharth. l
know that it doesn't..

760
01:09:23,227 --> 01:09:27,131
..suit you to agree to this,
but understand this..

761
01:09:27,231 --> 01:09:29,825
Karan and me.. are just friends.

762
01:09:31,336 --> 01:09:33,770
l want to be alone at
this cusp of time in life.

763
01:09:36,674 --> 01:09:39,336
l know that it is
difficult for both of us.

764
01:09:41,179 --> 01:09:43,670
But we have to spend a few
last hours of life together.

765
01:09:44,349 --> 01:09:46,249
l will go away after this case.

766
01:09:47,685 --> 01:09:50,176
Siddharth, we were once in love.

767
01:09:50,688 --> 01:09:53,179
We were immensely in love once.

768
01:09:55,693 --> 01:10:00,562
Can we not finish this
relation with respect and grace?

769
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:03,861
Please..

770
01:10:07,705 --> 01:10:09,195
Okay.

771
01:10:53,418 --> 01:10:55,219
Those moments..

772
01:10:55,319 --> 01:10:57,221
Those words..

773
01:10:57,321 --> 01:11:00,586
Nobody knows them..

774
01:11:00,758 --> 01:11:06,594
Those nights, those rains.

775
01:11:07,432 --> 01:11:12,597
Those drenched memories.

776
01:11:13,438 --> 01:11:17,772
Those drenched memories.

777
01:11:29,454 --> 01:11:31,945
l don't know..

778
01:11:34,792 --> 01:11:37,784
Neither do you know..

779
01:11:41,299 --> 01:11:44,632
What is this season?

780
01:11:45,470 --> 01:11:48,803
Nobody knows about it.

781
01:11:50,641 --> 01:11:54,805
Where did this breeze come from?

782
01:11:55,646 --> 01:11:59,980
lt brought the warmth
of sadness with it.

783
01:12:00,485 --> 01:12:04,922
We were saddened.

784
01:12:06,491 --> 01:12:10,825
We were separated.

785
01:12:12,497 --> 01:12:15,660
Those moments..

786
01:12:15,867 --> 01:12:17,802
Those words..

787
01:12:17,902 --> 01:12:20,336
Nobody knows them..

788
01:12:20,838 --> 01:12:26,902
Those nights, those rains.

789
01:12:27,678 --> 01:12:31,842
Those drenched memories.

790
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:37,685
Those drenched memories.

791
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:31,908
Our love is deeper than
the depths of the ocean.

792
01:13:32,910 --> 01:13:41,909
How will there be
spring in this breeze?

793
01:13:42,753 --> 01:13:46,746
From where this breeze comes?

794
01:13:47,592 --> 01:13:51,926
Why there were empty clouds?

795
01:13:53,598 --> 01:13:57,090
Why were we saddened?

796
01:13:58,436 --> 01:14:02,930
We were separated.

797
01:14:04,108 --> 01:14:06,440
Those moments..

798
01:14:07,445 --> 01:14:09,480
Those words..

799
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:12,105
Nobody knows them..

800
01:14:12,783 --> 01:14:18,779
Those nights, those rains.

801
01:14:19,624 --> 01:14:23,958
Those drenched memories.

802
01:14:25,129 --> 01:14:29,964
Those drenched memories.

803
01:15:28,222 --> 01:15:30,124
Just a minute. Madam..

804
01:15:30,224 --> 01:15:32,818
Look what we found at the
blast site. This is RDX.

805
01:15:33,327 --> 01:15:35,488
What?
- This is a clear murder case, madam.

806
01:15:35,630 --> 01:15:37,621
Someone has knowingly
blown up this house.

807
01:15:37,765 --> 01:15:40,495
Sean and Anna have
been murdered, madam.

808
01:15:41,235 --> 01:15:42,470
Did you call the
commissioner's office?

809
01:15:42,570 --> 01:15:45,139
Yes.. no.. l was waiting for you.
l will do it right away.

810
01:15:45,239 --> 01:15:48,543
l want to know
everything about Anna and Sean.

811
01:15:48,643 --> 01:15:52,146
Who they were? Where they worked?
And whom they met?

812
01:15:52,246 --> 01:15:54,180
l want all the information.

813
01:15:59,787 --> 01:16:01,186
Have you eaten?

814
01:16:02,590 --> 01:16:04,182
No.

815
01:16:04,659 --> 01:16:06,650
Okay, go ahead. l will ask
someone else. - No, it is all right.

816
01:16:07,528 --> 01:16:09,189
Tell me, what is the matter?

817
01:16:10,465 --> 01:16:14,196
l just got the information that
Anna worked in a gallery in Baga.

818
01:16:14,535 --> 01:16:16,196
We will have to meet its owner.

819
01:16:16,671 --> 01:16:18,195
Do you want to come with me?

820
01:16:21,209 --> 01:16:22,369
Come on.

821
01:16:23,544 --> 01:16:25,205
Yes. May l help you please?

822
01:16:25,746 --> 01:16:27,582
Hello. l am lnspector Sonia Verma.

823
01:16:27,682 --> 01:16:29,877
l want to ask
something about Anna Verghese.

824
01:16:30,284 --> 01:16:33,549
Oh, Anna Verghese. But
she resigned yesterday.

825
01:16:34,489 --> 01:16:36,218
Suddenly?

826
01:16:36,390 --> 01:16:38,192
You know.. this is very sad.

827
01:16:38,292 --> 01:16:40,194
That poor girl found
out that she has cancer.

828
01:16:40,294 --> 01:16:42,196
l mean.. terminal cancer.

829
01:16:42,296 --> 01:16:44,198
Cancer?

830
01:16:44,298 --> 01:16:46,562
Yes. But she didn't
tell anyone about this.

831
01:16:46,901 --> 01:16:49,836
Would you like to tell me
something else about Anna Verghese?

832
01:16:50,304 --> 01:16:52,898
She had an affair with someone else.

833
01:16:57,512 --> 01:16:59,241
Did she tell you this herself?

834
01:17:01,582 --> 01:17:03,914
Tell me. Don't worry.

835
01:17:06,754 --> 01:17:08,745
No. she didn't tell me this herself.

836
01:17:08,923 --> 01:17:10,914
But l felt that she had an affair.

837
01:17:12,326 --> 01:17:13,588
Why?

838
01:17:15,263 --> 01:17:17,595
She left work early a few days ago.

839
01:17:17,798 --> 01:17:19,767
Maybe she had to go somewhere.

840
01:17:19,867 --> 01:17:22,597
She talked to someone over
the phone that morning too.

841
01:17:23,271 --> 01:17:26,641
She told me that if
her husband calls up..

842
01:17:26,741 --> 01:17:28,675
l should say that she has
gone for Mr. D'souza's work.

843
01:17:29,010 --> 01:17:31,245
Did she tell you where they
were going.. And who he was?

844
01:17:31,345 --> 01:17:33,247
No.

845
01:17:33,347 --> 01:17:35,716
l don't know who he was.

846
01:17:35,816 --> 01:17:37,943
But they were going
to some bank, maybe.

847
01:17:38,452 --> 01:17:41,615
Mr. D'souza, she was asking
you about some bank that day.

848
01:17:42,023 --> 01:17:43,524
Which bank was that?

849
01:17:43,624 --> 01:17:45,683
Oh, yes.. HDFC bank.

850
01:17:50,698 --> 01:17:52,962
Did anyone ever
come to meet her here?

851
01:17:53,367 --> 01:17:55,269
Hello, HDFC bank.

852
01:17:55,369 --> 01:17:58,634
Can l speak to the manager?
This is lnspector Mehra.

853
01:17:59,373 --> 01:18:00,635
Thank you.

854
01:18:01,576 --> 01:18:03,811
Good afternoon, sir.
This is lnspector Mehra.

855
01:18:03,911 --> 01:18:05,613
l wanted some information.

856
01:18:05,713 --> 01:18:08,910
Did some Mrs. Anna Verghese
come to your bank last week?

857
01:18:10,051 --> 01:18:11,643
Yes, Anna Verghese.

858
01:18:12,386 --> 01:18:13,648
Had she come?

859
01:18:13,788 --> 01:18:15,915
Can you tell me with
whom had she come?

860
01:18:18,326 --> 01:18:19,657
Had she come with her husband?

861
01:18:20,728 --> 01:18:22,897
Okay, thank you. Thank you
very much. That will be all.

862
01:18:22,997 --> 01:18:26,398
The dialed number does not exist.
Please check the number.

863
01:18:30,071 --> 01:18:33,307
Mr. D'souza, did she
tell you about anybody else?

864
01:18:33,407 --> 01:18:34,840
No.
- l am outside.

865
01:18:40,948 --> 01:18:42,347
What happened to you?

866
01:18:43,851 --> 01:18:45,341
What?

867
01:18:45,886 --> 01:18:49,686
l didn't complete my investigation.

868
01:18:49,890 --> 01:18:51,325
You just left in between.
l don't like this.

869
01:18:51,425 --> 01:18:54,690
What else was there to know?
We found out everything.

870
01:18:54,895 --> 01:18:57,022
l wanted the name of
Anna Verghese's doctor.

871
01:18:57,431 --> 01:18:59,333
l want to know more about them.

872
01:18:59,433 --> 01:19:01,424
Where?

873
01:19:02,036 --> 01:19:03,738
We have to go to St.
Michael's hospital.

874
01:19:03,838 --> 01:19:06,033
l have to go to the police station.
l have some important work.

875
01:19:07,908 --> 01:19:09,375
What work?

876
01:19:12,046 --> 01:19:13,843
That's none of your business.

877
01:19:14,048 --> 01:19:16,881
Siddharth, this is not your house.

878
01:19:18,119 --> 01:19:20,053
You don't rule here.

879
01:19:20,454 --> 01:19:22,718
l am responsible for this case.

880
01:19:23,858 --> 01:19:25,960
So, if l tell you that we
are going to the hospital..

881
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:27,721
..we are going to the hospital.

882
01:19:29,397 --> 01:19:30,796
Do you understand?

883
01:19:51,085 --> 01:19:52,416
Just a minute.

884
01:19:59,493 --> 01:20:01,484
Here. Eat this -. l am not hungry.

885
01:20:03,097 --> 01:20:04,732
Why are you not hungry?

886
01:20:04,832 --> 01:20:07,494
You haven't eaten
anything since morning.

887
01:20:08,035 --> 01:20:09,434
You will have to eat this.

888
01:20:10,771 --> 01:20:12,432
ls this an order too, madam?

889
01:20:15,109 --> 01:20:17,976
Request. l am sorry.

890
01:20:27,788 --> 01:20:29,449
Shall we go?

891
01:20:41,469 --> 01:20:43,801
Anna Verghese never had cancer.

892
01:20:45,473 --> 01:20:47,975
What are you saying? Are you sure?

893
01:20:48,075 --> 01:20:50,044
Yes. l have been her
doctor since the beginning..

894
01:20:50,144 --> 01:20:52,874
l have looked after her ever
since she has come from Dubai.

895
01:20:53,147 --> 01:20:55,138
She never had cancer.

896
01:20:55,816 --> 01:20:58,876
lf she didn't have cancer,
why did she lie?

897
01:21:01,021 --> 01:21:04,081
ls it possible that she
went to some other doctor?

898
01:21:05,226 --> 01:21:06,460
And you don't know it..

899
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:10,826
lt's possible. But she had a
medical check-up last week.

900
01:21:11,031 --> 01:21:14,468
lf she had cancer, l
would have known it.

901
01:21:14,568 --> 01:21:17,036
But.. who told you
that she had cancer?

902
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:19,501
Excuse me..

903
01:21:45,599 --> 01:21:46,861
Yes?

904
01:21:49,136 --> 01:21:52,867
l want to meet Dr. Amitabh Khanna.

905
01:21:55,609 --> 01:21:58,544
That's me. Tell me.

906
01:21:58,712 --> 01:21:59,914
l will call you later.
Someone has come to my cabin.

907
01:22:00,014 --> 01:22:02,278
Yes?
- Was Anna Verghese your patient?

908
01:22:02,817 --> 01:22:05,586
Look, young man, l can't
give you this information.

909
01:22:05,686 --> 01:22:06,854
Look..

910
01:22:06,954 --> 01:22:09,190
lt is necessary for me to know this.

911
01:22:09,290 --> 01:22:10,925
Was Anna Verghese your patient?

912
01:22:11,025 --> 01:22:14,028
This hospital has some rules.
- Yes or no?

913
01:22:14,128 --> 01:22:15,529
What a strange man!

914
01:22:15,629 --> 01:22:17,531
He doesn't understand..

915
01:22:17,631 --> 01:22:19,622
Yes or no?

916
01:22:22,837 --> 01:22:24,566
No.

917
01:22:24,738 --> 01:22:27,298
l didn't treat any
patient by this name.

918
01:22:29,844 --> 01:22:31,573
l am sorry.

919
01:22:33,981 --> 01:22:36,916
Like Autologous, cancer vaccine.

920
01:22:39,987 --> 01:22:41,956
ls this your pen?

921
01:22:42,056 --> 01:22:44,725
This is my pen, but l don't use this.

922
01:22:44,825 --> 01:22:46,160
l use this pen.

923
01:22:46,260 --> 01:22:47,728
Can l take this?

924
01:22:47,828 --> 01:22:50,092
Yes, sure.

925
01:22:53,934 --> 01:22:55,569
Thank you. Thank you.

926
01:22:55,669 --> 01:22:59,073
The patient on bed no. 5
should have a caesarean.

927
01:22:59,173 --> 01:23:01,976
You go to the OT.
Call the anesthetist.

928
01:23:02,076 --> 01:23:03,577
And let me know if
you need anything else.

929
01:23:03,677 --> 01:23:05,980
Check her blood pressure
before we start anything.

930
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:08,082
Oh, officer Mehra..

931
01:23:08,182 --> 01:23:12,118
The lady who came with you.
She is waiting for you outside.

932
01:23:14,688 --> 01:23:16,622
Doctor..

933
01:23:16,790 --> 01:23:18,793
l wanted to ask you a question.
- Yes?

934
01:23:18,893 --> 01:23:20,194
Was Anna Verghese pregnant?
- Pregnant?

935
01:23:20,294 --> 01:23:23,627
Not at all.

936
01:23:30,905 --> 01:23:33,373
Call them up, Raj. We need them.

937
01:23:33,908 --> 01:23:36,308
Hold on. What happened now?
- Nothing.

938
01:23:36,710 --> 01:23:40,305
The sandwich was not good. Sorry.

939
01:23:40,714 --> 01:23:41,816
Are you all right now?

940
01:23:41,916 --> 01:23:44,646
Yes.

941
01:23:46,820 --> 01:23:49,957
Raj, since how many years are
you working in the police force?

942
01:23:50,057 --> 01:23:51,692
l don't care.

943
01:23:51,792 --> 01:23:54,818
l want Anna Verghese's phone records.

944
01:23:56,730 --> 01:23:58,664
That's it. Come on.

945
01:24:00,067 --> 01:24:02,303
This is what he looks like.

946
01:24:02,403 --> 01:24:04,805
lnspector, he looked like this.

947
01:24:04,905 --> 01:24:06,140
Oh..

948
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:07,808
There is good news.
We found a witness.

949
01:24:07,908 --> 01:24:11,145
Look..

950
01:24:11,245 --> 01:24:14,148
Did he look like this?
- Yes, exactly.

951
01:24:14,248 --> 01:24:16,717
This aunty is Sean's neighbor.

952
01:24:16,817 --> 01:24:19,653
And just before the blast,
she saw some person..

953
01:24:19,753 --> 01:24:23,324
..trying to barge into
Anna Verghese's house.

954
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:26,660
We are preparing a sketch
according to that description.

955
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:30,064
Good, isn't it?
- Yes, call Kumar inside.

956
01:24:30,164 --> 01:24:31,832

Do you know this man?

960
01:24:41,775 --> 01:24:44,178
No. He can be anyone.

961
01:24:44,278 --> 01:24:45,946
This could be anyone.

962
01:24:46,046 --> 01:24:48,207
He looked like him.

963
01:24:49,984 --> 01:24:51,975
Like him.

964
01:24:53,988 --> 01:24:55,785
He looked like him.

01:25:02,796 --> 01:25:05,890
No..no.. madam.. he is
the head of our department.

Your eyes are weak.

972
01:25:25,219 --> 01:25:27,121
Tell uncle to take
you to a nice doctor.

973
01:25:27,221 --> 01:25:28,722
Tell Kumar that Siddharth
is calling him. - Yes, sir.

01:25:57,851 --> 01:25:59,842
Just a second.

985
01:26:00,854 --> 01:26:03,257
lnspector Mehra.

01:26:06,860 --> 01:26:09,430
l have heard that you are
in charge of the Carl case?

988
01:26:09,530 --> 01:26:12,299
Do you have all the
proof of that case?

989
01:26:12,399 --> 01:26:14,835
Yes.. you mean.. cocaine?

990
01:26:14,935 --> 01:26:18,132
The money that was caught with it.

Yes?

992
01:26:24,378 --> 01:26:26,447
Look, we found out that
the money came from..

993
01:26:26,547 --> 01:26:28,115
..another drug dealer, Sunil Jaiswal.

994
01:26:28,215 --> 01:26:30,784
So, we want to identify the
serial numbers of the notes.

995
01:26:30,884 --> 01:26:32,786
lf Sunil Jaiswal's note numbers,..

996
01:26:32,886 --> 01:26:34,855

..we can arrest both of them.

998
01:26:38,892 --> 01:26:41,328
Sunil and Carl, both.

999
01:26:41,428 --> 01:26:43,864
Both our tasks will be done.

1000
01:26:43,964 --> 01:26:46,300
According to the law, the
proof will remain with me.

1001
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:48,802
And l will present
the proof in the court.

1002
01:26:48,902 --> 01:26:51,972
Mehra, don't try to teach me the law.

1003
01:26:52,072 --> 01:26:53,974
l know law better than you.

1004
01:26:54,074 --> 01:26:55,809
l don't have time to waste.

1005
01:26:55,909 --> 01:26:59,037
Keep the notes ready, my
man will be there in an hour.

Right now? Sir l am busy

01:27:31,612 --> 01:27:32,846
l have to do something important.
- Nothing will be done.

1013
01:27:32,946 --> 01:27:36,183

..or else l am in for it today too.

1022
01:27:58,305 --> 01:27:59,636
James..

01:27:59,973 --> 01:28:02,908
ls he all right?

1024
01:28:04,178 --> 01:28:06,213
Siddharth? Yes, why?

1025
01:28:06,313 --> 01:28:08,907
Okay.. ls it because he scolded him?

1026
01:28:09,082 --> 01:28:13,416
There's no problem. Don't be tensed.

1027
01:28:15,189 --> 01:28:17,891
Men don't know..

1028
01:28:17,991 --> 01:28:20,459
..that their wives know them
better than they themselves.

1029
01:28:23,096 --> 01:28:25,087
Siddharth is not all right.

1030
01:28:26,099 --> 01:28:27,901
No, it isn't anything like that.

1031
01:28:28,001 --> 01:28:30,237
Kumar must have done something.

1032
01:28:30,337 --> 01:28:32,328
l will get the reports.

1033
01:28:39,213 --> 01:28:41,204
Madam..this..

1034
01:28:42,115 --> 01:28:44,015
Madam..

1035
01:28:45,219 --> 01:28:46,920
Madam..

1036
01:28:47,020 --> 01:28:50,090
This.. we got some burnt
things from Verghese's house.

1037
01:28:50,190 --> 01:28:53,489
The rest is in ashes.
Will you please see them?

1038
01:29:22,389 --> 01:29:23,981
What is this?

1039
01:29:24,324 --> 01:29:26,627
Anna Verghese's passbook.

1040
01:29:26,727 --> 01:29:29,719
lt seems that she took a
life insurance policy.

1041
01:29:31,064 --> 01:29:33,467
Find out who its beneficiary is.

1042
01:29:33,567 --> 01:29:35,159
Her husband must be the beneficiary,
isn't it?

1043
01:29:36,069 --> 01:29:37,971
Still, find out..

1044
01:29:38,071 --> 01:29:40,040
What if someone has
killed them for money?

1045
01:29:40,140 --> 01:29:42,165
Okay, madam.
- Go.

1046
01:29:47,414 --> 01:29:49,405
What happened?

1047
01:29:51,285 --> 01:29:52,986
Nothing. Where is James?

1048
01:29:53,086 --> 01:29:55,055
He has gone to take the
post mortem report. Why?

1049
01:29:55,155 --> 01:29:56,990
No, it's nothing.

1050
01:29:57,090 --> 01:29:59,615
l will speak to him over the phone.
- Okay.

1051
01:30:18,211 --> 01:30:21,044
Sir.. sir..

1052
01:30:21,214 --> 01:30:22,349
Are these Verghese's phone records?
- No, it is my fax.

1053
01:30:22,449 --> 01:30:24,518
Where are the phone records?

1054
01:30:24,618 --> 01:30:26,553
The girl is sending it.. Tulip.
- Who?

1055
01:30:26,653 --> 01:30:28,188
She is a girl.

1056
01:30:28,288 --> 01:30:30,190
She works in BSNL.

1057
01:30:30,290 --> 01:30:32,526
Raj, l am waiting
since the last two hours.

1058
01:30:32,626 --> 01:30:35,117
Look, madam..

1059

in the past two hours..

1060
01:30:38,632 --> 01:30:40,634
Nihal..

1061
01:30:40,734 --> 01:30:43,036
Call BSNL and find out..

1062
01:30:43,136 --> 01:30:46,799
Why are you calling Nihal?
Give me five minutes..

1063
01:31:10,263 --> 01:31:12,466
Tulip.. This is Raj here..

1064

Verghese's phone records..

1065
01:31:14,768 --> 01:31:17,070
Yes, that is what l am saying too.

1066
01:31:17,170 --> 01:31:19,161
l haven't got any fax as yet.

1067
01:31:21,174 --> 01:31:24,610
Siddharth, you know
many bankers,right?

1068
01:31:25,379 --> 01:31:28,837
Can you find about
Anna Verghese's bankers?

1069
01:31:30,183 --> 01:31:32,252
Yes, l would do that right away.

1070
01:31:32,352 --> 01:31:33,420
Ok.

1071
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:37,286
You would have got an ok through your
fax but l haven't received any fax.

1072
01:31:38,191 --> 01:31:41,854
Our fax machine is perfectly
all right. You mean, l am lying?

1073
01:31:42,396 --> 01:31:44,264
What do you mean by what can you do?

1074
01:31:44,364 --> 01:31:47,333
Siddharth, any clue
about that insurance company?

1075
01:31:49,202 --> 01:31:51,171
l am sorry to have forgotten.

1076
01:31:51,271 --> 01:31:52,439
l will do that just now.

1077
01:31:52,539 --> 01:31:55,275
Siddharth, you know how important
this case is for us.. and you..

1078
01:31:55,375 --> 01:31:58,139
Madam, we have received the fax.

1079
01:32:07,220 --> 01:32:09,211
Yes, it has.. but the paper..

1080
01:32:11,324 --> 01:32:13,884
..l will get the paper right away.

1081
01:32:25,238 --> 01:32:27,207
Raj.. what happened to that paper?

1082
01:32:27,307 --> 01:32:29,241
Getting it right away, madam.

1083
01:32:30,577 --> 01:32:32,813
The paper needs to be inserted.

1084
01:32:32,913 --> 01:32:34,505
Here it is.

1085
01:32:43,690 --> 01:32:45,920
The start button needs to be pressed.

1086
01:32:46,359 --> 01:32:48,762
ls there anyone who can
operate this fax machine?

1087
01:32:48,862 --> 01:32:50,664
Just a second.

1088
01:32:50,764 --> 01:32:52,527
This machine seems
to have some problem.

1089
01:32:57,270 --> 01:32:59,439
Conked off again.

1090
01:32:59,539 --> 01:33:00,674
We will need to get it repaired.

1091
01:33:00,774 --> 01:33:02,175
l will call Tulip.

1092
01:33:02,275 --> 01:33:04,209
No, l will handle this.

1093
01:33:05,278 --> 01:33:07,212
lt was loose.

1094
01:33:11,485 --> 01:33:13,214
Here it is.

1095
01:33:15,288 --> 01:33:17,257
Madam.. you want to get it rechecked?

1096
01:33:17,357 --> 01:33:20,724
Not needed.
- Not needed, madam.

1097
01:33:22,295 --> 01:33:24,820
Thanks.
- Ok.

1098
01:33:30,504 --> 01:33:32,806
Here is the postmortem report.

1099
01:33:32,906 --> 01:33:34,374
What does it say?

1100
01:33:34,474 --> 01:33:35,542
Nothing much, except that..

1101
01:33:35,642 --> 01:33:38,770
..at the time of the blast,
both of them were already dead.

1102
01:33:40,313 --> 01:33:42,382
What do you mean?

1103
01:33:42,482 --> 01:33:45,218
Means.. what do they call them..

1104
01:33:45,318 --> 01:33:47,980
..yes, lungs.. no smoke
was found in their lungs.

1105
01:33:48,321 --> 01:33:51,224
See, it was a blast. And had they..

1106
01:33:51,324 --> 01:33:53,627
..died in that blast, their lungs..

1107
01:33:53,727 --> 01:33:56,252
..would have been in a far
worse condition than mine.

1108
01:33:57,531 --> 01:33:59,590
Sonia, my last cigarette!

1109
01:34:00,433 --> 01:34:03,596
Both the bodies were badly burnt.

1110
01:34:03,737 --> 01:34:05,762
The rest is in this. Read it.

1111
01:34:11,344 --> 01:34:13,869
Madam, shall l put these phone
records of the case in the file?

1112
01:34:17,551 --> 01:34:19,542
224078..

1113
01:34:20,554 --> 01:34:22,422
..this number belongs to
this place, right? - Yes.

1114
01:34:22,522 --> 01:34:26,014
Last night who called
Anna Verghese from here?

1115
01:34:26,693 --> 01:34:29,025
Don't argue and just
follow my instructions.

1116
01:34:33,567 --> 01:34:36,297
Who was the duty
officer here, last night?

1117
01:34:44,578 --> 01:34:47,479
Who called Anna Verghese from
this police station, last night?

1118
01:34:52,652 --> 01:34:56,315
Sonia.. what time, did you mention?

1119
01:34:56,489 --> 01:34:58,320
9:30

1120
01:34:59,593 --> 01:35:01,561
Oh my God!

1121
01:35:01,661 --> 01:35:04,061
l am so sorry, l forgot.

1122
01:35:04,397 --> 01:35:06,633
l had called up for Sean.

1123
01:35:06,733 --> 01:35:10,066
You? - l just thought of a
couple of drinks with him.

1124
01:35:10,937 --> 01:35:13,306
l tried on his
cellphone but it was off.

1125
01:35:13,406 --> 01:35:16,710
So l tried his wife
to enquire about him.

1126
01:35:16,810 --> 01:35:18,812
So Sean and you were good friends?

1127
01:35:18,912 --> 01:35:21,481
Yeah, Sonia. l
needed company for drinks.

1128
01:35:21,581 --> 01:35:24,317
So l thought if no one else,
even he will do. That's all.

1129
01:35:24,417 --> 01:35:26,987
James, you should've
informed me at least.

1130
01:35:27,087 --> 01:35:29,322
Didn't l say, l forgot?

1131
01:35:29,422 --> 01:35:31,391
You don't trust me? Ok.

1132
01:35:31,491 --> 01:35:33,727
Call up the bar and enquire.
l was there the last night.

1133
01:35:33,827 --> 01:35:36,329
l was sloshed. And after that l
went and collapsed beside my wife.

1134
01:35:36,429 --> 01:35:38,331
That's it.

1135
01:35:38,431 --> 01:35:40,734
Ok, talk to my wife. Call her up.

1136
01:35:40,834 --> 01:35:43,837
James.
- Sonia, l give you my statement.

1137
01:35:43,937 --> 01:35:47,031
Ok. Raj, record his statement.

1138
01:35:48,541 --> 01:35:50,372
Come.

1139
01:35:55,649 --> 01:35:57,378
Salutes, sir.

1140
01:36:12,465 --> 01:36:16,401
Will you tell me about
the whole incident now?

1141
01:36:19,673 --> 01:36:21,664
l had a relationship with her.

1142
01:36:22,575 --> 01:36:25,135
What?

1143
01:36:26,479 --> 01:36:28,413
What?

1144
01:36:29,482 --> 01:36:31,451
Oh Christ..

1145
01:36:31,551 --> 01:36:35,388
..that means..

1146
01:36:35,488 --> 01:36:37,390
..you had done this..?

1147
01:36:37,490 --> 01:36:39,481
Gone mad? Why will l kill her?

1148
01:36:42,595 --> 01:36:44,586
James, someone is
trying to implicate me.

1149
01:36:48,702 --> 01:36:51,471
l see.. did you tell this to Sonia?

1150
01:36:51,571 --> 01:36:52,739
What will l say to Sonia?

1151
01:36:52,839 --> 01:36:56,707
Why not? - All the
evidences are against me, James.

1152
01:36:59,612 --> 01:37:01,915
l had a relationship
with Anna Verghese.

1153
01:37:02,015 --> 01:37:04,176
l am the beneficiary
of her insurance policy.

1154
01:37:04,517 --> 01:37:07,179
And that old auntie had seen me
outside her house in the night.

1155
01:37:08,722 --> 01:37:10,622
And.. and.. what else?

1156
01:37:13,626 --> 01:37:15,495
l had given the
Drugs Raid Money to her.

1157
01:37:15,595 --> 01:37:17,460
You gave her the raid money..
- Shh..

1158
01:37:21,735 --> 01:37:25,193
You gave her drugs raid money?

1159
01:37:26,539 --> 01:37:28,530
All of it?

1160
01:37:31,544 --> 01:37:35,207
l had warned you of falling
in a huge trouble one day.

1161
01:37:36,549 --> 01:37:39,853
Buddy, l have a big
problem as regards women.. but..

1162
01:37:39,953 --> 01:37:43,480
..you have turned out to be
much ahead of me. Mind Blowing!

1163
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:51,223
What now? What will you do now?

1164
01:37:52,766 --> 01:37:54,495
Don't know.

1165
01:37:54,667 --> 01:37:56,636
Look.. your plane has crashed.

1166
01:37:56,736 --> 01:38:01,673
And you are drowning in
a deep sea of troubles.

1167
01:38:02,575 --> 01:38:05,669
Now only the boat of
her love can save you.

1168
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:07,881
Go and talk to Sonia.

1169
01:38:07,981 --> 01:38:10,245
She is your wife after all. - James..

1170
01:38:10,917 --> 01:38:13,010
She is your wife.

1171
01:38:13,586 --> 01:38:15,655
lf she doesn't
understand your problems..

1172
01:38:15,755 --> 01:38:17,017
..and helps you out, who else will?

1173
01:38:17,791 --> 01:38:20,021
Go.. go and talk to Sonia. Please.

1174
01:38:30,937 --> 01:38:32,529
Sonia..

1175
01:38:42,715 --> 01:38:44,546
l want to talk
something important to you.

1176
01:38:47,821 --> 01:38:49,550
Tell me.

1177
01:38:59,833 --> 01:39:02,233
What happened? Everything all right?

1178
01:39:02,969 --> 01:39:04,561
Sonia..

1179
01:39:09,642 --> 01:39:11,044
..after you had gone..

1180
01:39:11,144 --> 01:39:14,580
Madam.. we now know the
name of the insurance company.

1181
01:39:16,916 --> 01:39:20,317
What has happened to you, Raj?

1182
01:39:20,653 --> 01:39:22,722
Can't you see we are talking?
You should knock at least.

1183
01:39:22,822 --> 01:39:25,586
Sorry.. sorry.
- What happened?

1184
01:39:27,660 --> 01:39:29,729
We have come to know of
Anna Verghese's name..

1185
01:39:29,829 --> 01:39:34,067
..sorry.. we now know the name of
Anna Verghese's insurance company.

1186
01:39:34,167 --> 01:39:35,969
Nav Ketan Corporation.

1187
01:39:36,069 --> 01:39:38,571
But we are yet to find out about the
branch from where the policy was made.

1188
01:39:38,671 --> 01:39:40,740
So, go and find out.

1189
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:44,105
Sure.. right away.

1190
01:39:48,882 --> 01:39:51,612
l am sorry, Siddharth.
What were you saying?

1191
01:39:54,888 --> 01:39:58,790
Nothing.. l had come to just
compliment you about this case.

1192
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:04,361
And after a long time l
happen to see you so professional.

1193
01:40:04,898 --> 01:40:06,627
You are doing a good job!

1194
01:40:07,901 --> 01:40:09,630
Thanks.

1195
01:40:12,906 --> 01:40:15,374
But did you really
come to compliment me?

1196
01:40:16,809 --> 01:40:18,640
Yes.

1197
01:40:19,979 --> 01:40:24,382
Don't know l feel as if you had
come to give me some bad news.

1198
01:40:25,919 --> 01:40:27,716
Bad news?

1199
01:40:28,855 --> 01:40:31,653
What worse can happen between us?

1200
01:40:51,744 --> 01:40:52,979
Yes Kumar.. tell me.

1201
01:40:53,079 --> 01:40:55,315
Sir, we have got the
fingerprints on the pen.

1202
01:40:55,415 --> 01:40:57,650
They belong to some Harsh Yadav.

1203
01:40:57,750 --> 01:41:00,653
Scrutiny of the
criminal records show..

1204
01:41:00,753 --> 01:41:02,856
..that this Yadav has been
to jail a couple of times.

1205
01:41:02,956 --> 01:41:03,990
Any address?

1206
01:41:04,090 --> 01:41:05,725
Yes.

1207
01:41:05,825 --> 01:41:08,760

Old Anira Estate.

1208
01:41:13,766 --> 01:41:15,700
l will check inside.

1209
01:41:37,056 --> 01:41:39,047
Aha! Mind blowing!

1210
01:41:53,139 --> 01:41:55,130
Siddharth..

1211
01:41:56,009 --> 01:41:57,738
..Asif Bhai!

1212
01:41:57,910 --> 01:42:00,213
Belongs to this department.

1213
01:42:00,313 --> 01:42:01,781
A supplier of girls.

1214
01:42:01,881 --> 01:42:03,783
lf this Yadav is in Goa..

1215
01:42:03,883 --> 01:42:06,249
..then Asif must
surely know his whereabouts.

1216
01:42:07,820 --> 01:42:08,946
Let's go.

1217
01:42:11,924 --> 01:42:13,993
Oh no, forgot the beer.

1218
01:42:14,093 --> 01:42:15,822
l felt as if l forgot something!.

1219
01:42:16,829 --> 01:42:19,764
Drop me at the police station
and try to find this Yadav out.

1220
01:42:19,932 --> 01:42:23,095
lmmediately. l don't have any time.

1221
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:29,774
What are you doing, James?

1222
01:42:29,942 --> 01:42:31,744
lt is 40 overs.

1223
01:42:31,844 --> 01:42:33,746
100 more runs to go.

1224
01:42:33,846 --> 01:42:36,280
And only 2 wickets in hand.

1225
01:42:38,851 --> 01:42:42,155
What do you say? l have a
couple of Lakhs in my bank account.

1226
01:42:42,255 --> 01:42:43,823
We will head to the
airport straight for Dubai.

1227
01:42:43,923 --> 01:42:46,448

1228
01:42:47,126 --> 01:42:50,527
l have heard Dubai beats
Switzerland hands down now.

1229
01:42:50,963 --> 01:42:52,932
You are advising me to flee?

1230
01:42:53,032 --> 01:42:55,398
No.. l will drop you to
the airport in my car.

1231
01:42:56,969 --> 01:42:58,869
Offer is good. But no, thanks.

1232
01:42:59,872 --> 01:43:01,863
l am not the one to abscond.

1233
01:43:02,975 --> 01:43:04,806
Are you sure?

1234
01:43:04,977 --> 01:43:07,207
Yeah, l am sure.

1235
01:43:10,083 --> 01:43:12,785
Let's go, pal.

1236
01:43:12,885 --> 01:43:14,876
lt is death for both of us.

1237
01:43:18,891 --> 01:43:21,961
Hello. - Ma'am,

- Yes, ma'am.

1239
01:43:24,063 --> 01:43:26,966
Hello!
- lnspector Sonia Mehra on the line.

1240
01:43:27,066 --> 01:43:28,968
Tell me what information do you have?

1241
01:43:29,068 --> 01:43:31,804
Madam, the number of this
insurance policy is the same..

1242
01:43:31,904 --> 01:43:34,566
..as the 5 million
policy of Anna Verghese.

1243
01:43:35,108 --> 01:43:37,477
5 million?

1244
01:43:37,577 --> 01:43:39,312
Who is the beneficiary?

1245
01:43:39,412 --> 01:43:42,575
Just a second,
ma'am. Let me just check.

1246
01:43:45,118 --> 01:43:47,820
Just a second.. got it.

1247
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:50,252
Her husband, Sean Verghese.

1248
01:43:55,928 --> 01:43:57,330
Ok..

1249
01:43:57,430 --> 01:43:58,831
Just a second, madam.

1250
01:43:58,931 --> 01:44:02,264
lt seems Anna Verghese
changed the beneficiary's name.

1251
01:44:04,937 --> 01:44:06,172
Who is the new beneficiary?

1252
01:44:06,272 --> 01:44:08,866
Let me check it again, madam.

1253
01:44:10,042 --> 01:44:13,876
Madam, it is not here. Seems it
is with the processing department.

1254
01:44:14,046 --> 01:44:16,916
Can you put me to the
processing department?

1255
01:44:17,016 --> 01:44:19,252
Yeah sure..

1256
01:44:19,352 --> 01:44:21,354
..but they would be
out on lunch, right now.

1257
01:44:21,454 --> 01:44:23,888
You can talk to them
only after an hour.

1258
01:44:24,056 --> 01:44:26,259
Ok, l will call up in an hour.

1259
01:44:26,359 --> 01:44:27,883
Ok, madam.

1260
01:44:28,294 --> 01:44:30,888
Ma'am, will you please
have a look at this?

1261
01:44:31,063 --> 01:44:33,366
These are the
cellphone records of both.

1262
01:44:33,466 --> 01:44:35,368
All these numbers have been checked.

1263
01:44:35,468 --> 01:44:37,203
Everything is fine except one number.

1264
01:44:37,303 --> 01:44:39,567
There is one number that
belongs to some Yadav.

1265
01:44:39,972 --> 01:44:42,942
lt is a pre-paid number.

1266
01:44:43,042 --> 01:44:45,909
We tried many times
but it is switched off.

1267
01:44:47,980 --> 01:44:49,082
Yes, tell me, Siddharth.

1268
01:44:49,182 --> 01:44:51,884
James, Sonia has
come to know of Yadav.

1269
01:44:51,984 --> 01:44:53,953
Have you got any
information about Yadav?

1270
01:44:54,053 --> 01:44:56,155
Give me two minutes.
Just two minutes.

1271
01:44:56,255 --> 01:44:57,890
l don't know anything about Yadav..

1272
01:44:57,990 --> 01:44:59,492
Yeah, sure.. you
will come to know now.

1273
01:44:59,592 --> 01:45:01,924
l don't know anything about Yadav.
- Speak up.

1274
01:45:02,995 --> 01:45:05,088
Anyone who knows Subhash Yadav here?

1275
01:45:06,332 --> 01:45:07,924
Subhash Yadav?

1276
01:45:10,203 --> 01:45:12,171
No.
- Now listen to me carefully.

1277
01:45:12,271 --> 01:45:16,075
l want to know each and
everything about this man.

1278
01:45:16,175 --> 01:45:18,911
Where he is sits, where he stands..

1279
01:45:19,011 --> 01:45:20,413
..where he walks, what
he eats, what he drinks..

1280
01:45:20,513 --> 01:45:22,915
Siddharth.. - Yes. Yadav
is in a party at Caravella.

1281
01:45:23,015 --> 01:45:25,918
His friends.. his acquaintances..

1282
01:45:26,018 --> 01:45:27,987
..his circle.. l want
all the information.

1283
01:45:28,087 --> 01:45:30,282
l want this man today.

1284
01:45:31,023 --> 01:45:32,258
Salutes, sir!

1285
01:45:32,358 --> 01:45:33,950
Siddharth Mehra?

1286
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:37,930
l am Ravi Malhotra from
the Narcotics Department.

1287
01:45:38,030 --> 01:45:40,266
You must have had a
word with our officer.

1288
01:45:40,366 --> 01:45:42,459
l am here to take
the drugs raid money.

1289
01:45:44,237 --> 01:45:47,502
Yes, but Mr. Shah had asked me
to send the money to his office.

1290
01:45:49,041 --> 01:45:51,611
My man has just left with the money.

1291
01:45:51,711 --> 01:45:54,947
Your man? - Well, Mr. Shah
had said this in front of me..

1292
01:45:55,047 --> 01:45:57,116
..that his man will come
to collect the amount.

1293
01:45:57,216 --> 01:45:58,951
You must have heard it wrong.

1294
01:45:59,051 --> 01:46:02,487
Mr. Shah had asked me to
send the money to his office.

1295
01:46:03,055 --> 01:46:04,357
Check at your office.

1296
01:46:04,457 --> 01:46:06,391
Just a minute..

1297
01:46:09,161 --> 01:46:12,995
Mr. Shah.. yes. Talk to him
yourself. He is on the line.

1298
01:46:18,271 --> 01:46:19,372
What drama is this, Mehra?

1299
01:46:19,472 --> 01:46:21,641
Where is my money?

1300
01:46:21,741 --> 01:46:24,005
Sir, you had asked me to
send the money to your office.

1301
01:46:24,176 --> 01:46:26,479
l had said, l would be
sending my man along.

1302
01:46:26,579 --> 01:46:27,980
Sir you must be mistaken..

1303
01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:29,315
Cut the crap.

1304
01:46:29,415 --> 01:46:31,984
l very well remember what l had said.

1305
01:46:32,084 --> 01:46:34,487
lf you fool around with me, l will..

1306
01:46:34,587 --> 01:46:36,989
Hey.. what will you do?
What can you do?

1307
01:46:37,089 --> 01:46:39,492
What harm can you do?

1308
01:46:39,592 --> 01:46:43,396
You will suspend me?
Go ahead.. suspend me.

1309
01:46:43,496 --> 01:46:46,499
Do anything.. you bastard! You
want to strip me off my uniform!?

1310
01:46:46,599 --> 01:46:48,430
Bastard!

1311
01:46:49,702 --> 01:46:52,034
Oh.. hey.. my phone!

1312
01:47:14,860 --> 01:47:16,054
Thank you.

1313
01:47:55,434 --> 01:47:58,070
What nonsense? Your guys aren't
back from lunch as yet? - Madam..

1314
01:47:58,170 --> 01:48:00,832
l've been trying since the last
one hour. What company is this?

1315
01:48:01,173 --> 01:48:03,266
What is it, Raj?

1316
01:48:05,378 --> 01:48:08,108
Well.. yes, we have information
on Yadav. He is in Caravella.

1317
01:48:21,794 --> 01:48:25,431
What's wrong? Where are you going?

1318
01:48:25,531 --> 01:48:27,099
Yadav..
- Let go.

1319
01:48:27,199 --> 01:48:29,268
Yadav, listen to me.

1320
01:48:29,368 --> 01:48:32,132
Where are you going? Yadav!

1321
01:50:00,493 --> 01:50:02,528
Listen to me.. listen.

1322
01:50:02,628 --> 01:50:04,220
Open the door.

1323
01:50:24,517 --> 01:50:26,485
What happened?

1324
01:50:26,585 --> 01:50:30,248
He.. he.. killed him!

1325
01:50:46,338 --> 01:50:48,272
Go from that side.

1326
01:50:52,545 --> 01:50:53,646
You got all the money?
- Yes.

1327
01:50:53,746 --> 01:50:56,248
Mind blowing!

1328
01:50:56,348 --> 01:50:59,251
Well, we again have the
budget for Switzerland. Great!

1329
01:50:59,351 --> 01:51:02,254
Meet me at the police station.
l got some work. Hang up now.

1330
01:51:02,354 --> 01:51:04,657
Listen..

1331
01:51:04,757 --> 01:51:06,452
Bye, James.

1332
01:51:33,586 --> 01:51:34,687
You, here?.

1333
01:51:34,787 --> 01:51:36,652
Where had you disappeared?

1334
01:51:37,489 --> 01:51:39,320
l had gone to Dewar
lsland for some work.

1335
01:51:39,491 --> 01:51:41,823
l was headed towards
the police station.

1336
01:51:43,495 --> 01:51:45,929
l see. Come, l need to
talk something to you.

1337
01:51:58,410 --> 01:52:01,345
Siddharth, why do l feel that
you are hiding something from me?

1338
01:52:04,416 --> 01:52:05,718
What do you mean?

1339
01:52:05,818 --> 01:52:10,346
There is something which
you aren't telling me.

1340
01:52:10,522 --> 01:52:12,888
l don't know what exactly it is..

1341
01:52:13,425 --> 01:52:15,416
..but something fishy, definitely.

1342
01:52:20,633 --> 01:52:23,335
So, the Special
lnvestigating Officer..

1343
01:52:23,435 --> 01:52:25,869
..Ms. Sonia is interrogating me!

1344
01:52:29,541 --> 01:52:32,745
Stop suspecting
everyone for everything.

1345
01:52:32,845 --> 01:52:35,414
Stop being a policewoman,
all 24 hours.

1346
01:52:35,514 --> 01:52:36,682
Think like a wife, sometime at least.

1347
01:52:36,782 --> 01:52:40,019
Stop it, Siddarth.
Don't start this again.

1348
01:52:40,119 --> 01:52:42,354
Why not? What has happened to you?

1349
01:52:42,454 --> 01:52:43,556
You know where we are sitting?

1350
01:52:43,656 --> 01:52:47,114
Just have a look at the place. This
is the place of our first meeting.

1351
01:52:48,460 --> 01:52:50,429
Sonia, you have turned
blind to everything.

1352
01:52:50,529 --> 01:52:52,431
You have stopped
recognizing anything.

1353
01:52:52,531 --> 01:52:54,533
All that you see all the time..

1354
01:52:54,633 --> 01:52:57,397
..is your work, your
case and this police force.

1355
01:52:58,470 --> 01:52:59,572
Stop it, Siddharth!
Don't create a scene.

1356
01:52:59,672 --> 01:53:02,041
Scene? Why? Does that embarrass you?

1357
01:53:02,141 --> 01:53:04,043
Let go of my hand, Siddharth.

1358
01:53:04,143 --> 01:53:06,407
Want to know what l
am hiding from you?

1359
01:53:06,578 --> 01:53:09,548
l am hiding that love for you
which still exists within me.

1360
01:53:09,648 --> 01:53:11,912
The one which you are rebuffing!

1361
01:53:16,488 --> 01:53:19,391
By screaming and shouting
like this you have made me..

1362
01:53:19,491 --> 01:53:21,425
.. believe that there indeed is
something that you are hiding.

1363
01:53:23,495 --> 01:53:27,090
l will definitely find that out.

1364
01:53:36,709 --> 01:53:38,410
Sir.. sir..

1365
01:53:38,510 --> 01:53:40,679
Mr. Shah from the
Narcotics Department had called.

1366
01:53:40,779 --> 01:53:42,748
l said that you aren't here.

1367
01:53:42,848 --> 01:53:46,752
Sir.. he was cursing you and
threatened to come himself.

1368
01:53:46,852 --> 01:53:48,587
He was enquiring about the money.

1369
01:53:48,687 --> 01:53:51,053
l couldn't seem to understand..
- Go from here.

1370
01:53:51,724 --> 01:53:53,453
Ok.

1371
01:53:59,732 --> 01:54:02,462
Ma'am.. lt was Raj's
call from the Caravella.

1372
01:54:02,634 --> 01:54:04,436
He said he is headed for
here after recording..

1373
01:54:04,536 --> 01:54:06,060
..the statement of
Yadav's girlfriend.

1374
01:54:07,873 --> 01:54:11,468
Nihal, ask him to
bring that girl here.

1375
01:54:11,643 --> 01:54:14,780
l need to talk something to her.
And yes, something more.

1376
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:19,051
Call the insurance company. l
need to know about the beneficiary.

1377
01:54:19,151 --> 01:54:20,482
Sure.

1378
01:54:30,562 --> 01:54:32,496
Hello!

1379
01:54:37,770 --> 01:54:39,499
Siddharth.. l am sorry..

1380
01:54:42,574 --> 01:54:43,676
Anna?

1381
01:54:43,776 --> 01:54:45,644
l am sorry, Siddharth!

1382
01:54:45,744 --> 01:54:47,507
l am really very sorry.

1383
01:54:50,582 --> 01:54:52,551
l told you many lies.

1384
01:54:52,651 --> 01:54:54,887
But all this was under
instructions from my husband.

1385
01:54:54,987 --> 01:54:56,755
Anna.. where are you?

1386
01:54:56,855 --> 01:54:59,255
l don't want to die, Siddharth.

1387
01:55:01,693 --> 01:55:03,684
He.. he wants to kill me.

1388
01:55:04,797 --> 01:55:06,765
l don't want to die, Siddharth.

1389
01:55:06,865 --> 01:55:09,501
l didn't wish to do this to you.

1390
01:55:09,601 --> 01:55:10,769
What are you doing?

1391
01:55:10,869 --> 01:55:12,905
Talking to whom?

1392
01:55:13,005 --> 01:55:15,007
Let go.. let go of the phone.
- Anna!

1393
01:55:15,107 --> 01:55:17,541
Anna!?
- Sean is..

1394
01:55:23,615 --> 01:55:24,683
Hi, Siddharth!

1395
01:55:24,783 --> 01:55:26,614
Where is Anna?

1396
01:55:27,719 --> 01:55:30,210
Lying here.. this wretch.

1397
01:55:30,823 --> 01:55:34,860
l am enjoying hitting her a lot.

1398
01:55:34,960 --> 01:55:37,596
l am really enjoying it a lot!

1399
01:55:37,696 --> 01:55:38,731
Sean, let go of Anna!

1400
01:55:38,831 --> 01:55:42,562
Yeah sure. l don't need her.

1401
01:55:42,734 --> 01:55:46,727
All l want is my money.

1402
01:55:48,073 --> 01:55:51,304
The money which was
with my friend Yadav.

1403
01:55:51,977 --> 01:55:56,175
But someone killed him
and grabbed the money.

1404
01:55:56,849 --> 01:56:00,152
ls that money with you?

1405
01:56:00,252 --> 01:56:01,754
That money is with me.

1406
01:56:01,854 --> 01:56:04,556
Good, come to meet me
at the Old Cotton Mill.

1407
01:56:04,656 --> 01:56:07,750
Along with the money.

1408
01:56:34,953 --> 01:56:36,614
Come.

1409
01:56:41,693 --> 01:56:43,786
Hope you are all right!
- Yes.

1410
01:56:45,964 --> 01:56:49,957
Can you identify the person
who had killed Yadav? - Yes.

1411
01:56:51,904 --> 01:56:54,372
Ok, just wait here.

1412
01:56:54,706 --> 01:56:56,697
l want you to meet someone.

1413
01:57:01,713 --> 01:57:03,215
Where is lnspector Siddharth?

1414
01:57:03,315 --> 01:57:05,146
Perhaps in the loo, ma'am.

1415
01:57:05,918 --> 01:57:07,786
Excuse me, it's a call
from the insurance company.

1416
01:57:07,886 --> 01:57:09,649
Transfer the line.

1417
01:57:09,821 --> 01:57:11,023
lnspector Sonia Mehra here.

1418
01:57:11,123 --> 01:57:14,126
Madam, we have found the name
of Anna Verghese's beneficiary.

1419
01:57:14,226 --> 01:57:15,659
Who is the beneficiary?

1420
01:57:15,827 --> 01:57:19,160
Madam, the beneficiary's
name is Siddharth Mehra.

1421
01:57:27,940 --> 01:57:29,669
Open the door, Siddharth.

1422
01:57:30,943 --> 01:57:33,173
Siddharth, open the door.

1423
01:57:50,963 --> 01:57:52,731
Who is Siddharth Mehra?

1424
01:57:52,831 --> 01:57:54,666
Who is Siddharth Mehra?

1425
01:57:54,766 --> 01:57:56,068
Come out, Siddharth Mehra!

1426
01:57:56,168 --> 01:57:57,736
Who is Siddharth Mehra?

1427
01:57:57,836 --> 01:58:00,168
Malhotra, who is Siddharth Mehra?

1428
01:58:01,974 --> 01:58:04,276
l am being made a fool since morning.

1429
01:58:04,376 --> 01:58:07,179
l need that money of the
drugs raid to match the numbers.

1430
01:58:07,279 --> 01:58:10,182
First he says that the money has been
sent.. then he asks me to send my man.

1431
01:58:10,282 --> 01:58:12,851
l must have called a
hundred times since morning..

1432
01:58:12,951 --> 01:58:15,442
..but there is no one over
here to give me a clear answer.

1433
01:58:15,787 --> 01:58:18,690
l too have to answer someone.

1434
01:58:18,790 --> 01:58:20,724
This is a highly
irresponsible behaviour!

1435
01:58:32,004 --> 01:58:35,064
Thanks Siddharth, thank you so much.

1436
01:58:35,907 --> 01:58:38,043
You have just created
one more trouble for me.

1437
01:58:38,143 --> 01:58:39,711
Listen to me, Sonia, please.

1438
01:58:39,811 --> 01:58:42,143
l have faced many bad
days with you, Siddharth.

1439
01:58:42,814 --> 01:58:44,716
But l had never even dreamt of..

1440
01:58:44,816 --> 01:58:46,750
..facing something worse than this..

1441
01:58:46,918 --> 01:58:50,251
..that l'd be required to arrest you.

1442
01:58:50,822 --> 01:58:52,724
Listen to me, Sonia.

1443
01:58:52,824 --> 01:58:56,419
l have told you numerous lies and l
know you won't believe me anymore.

1444
01:58:56,828 --> 01:58:58,762
But, l am not guilty.

1445
01:58:58,930 --> 01:59:01,421
Just give me some time.

1446
01:59:02,034 --> 01:59:03,936
l will prove my innocence.

1447
01:59:04,036 --> 01:59:05,970
You are fibbing again.

1448
01:59:06,838 --> 01:59:10,742
But all this is useless. No
matter what pains l have to undergo..

1449
01:59:10,842 --> 01:59:14,175
..l will arrest you for sure.

1450
01:59:16,848 --> 01:59:18,782
Where are you?

1451
02:00:03,095 --> 02:00:04,824
What happened to you?

1452
02:01:16,968 --> 02:01:19,300
Anna.. give that to me.

1453
02:01:21,973 --> 02:01:23,907
Give that to me.

1454
02:01:56,208 --> 02:01:57,937
Whom are you trying to call?

1455
02:01:58,343 --> 02:01:59,935
Police.

1456
02:02:01,213 --> 02:02:02,942
Let go of the phone, Siddarth.

1457
02:02:05,016 --> 02:02:06,950
l said, hang up.

1458
02:02:15,026 --> 02:02:16,928
Anna, the police won't arrest you.

1459
02:02:17,028 --> 02:02:19,121
You did this in self-defence.

1460
02:02:23,034 --> 02:02:24,968
Don't be stupid. Give me the gun.

1461
02:02:27,239 --> 02:02:30,970
You think, all this was done by Sean?

1462
02:02:38,049 --> 02:02:39,983
So, you had done all this?

1463
02:02:43,255 --> 02:02:44,956
Sean was just a pawn!?

1464
02:02:45,056 --> 02:02:48,651
Yes, just like you
are one of the pawns.

1465
02:02:50,061 --> 02:02:53,155
lt is so easy to fool men like you.

1466
02:02:54,332 --> 02:02:57,165
And how easily you got trapped again.

1467
02:02:58,336 --> 02:03:01,999
C'mon, give this money to me.

1468
02:03:03,074 --> 02:03:05,065
Hand over the money to me, Siddharth.

1469
02:03:06,278 --> 02:03:08,007
Give me the money, Siddharth.

1470
02:03:13,285 --> 02:03:15,515
Bloody bitch!

1471
02:03:37,108 --> 02:03:39,042
Good bye, Siddharth!

1472
02:04:07,339 --> 02:04:09,068
You all right?

1473
02:04:12,243 --> 02:04:14,074
Yes.

1474
02:04:14,245 --> 02:04:16,076
You killed Yadav?

1475
02:04:16,348 --> 02:04:20,079
No, not intentionally.

1476
02:04:21,353 --> 02:04:24,083
l tried to ask for the
drug raid money from him..

1477
02:04:24,255 --> 02:04:26,416
..and he died accidentally.

1478
02:04:28,360 --> 02:04:30,419
What did you intend
to do with the money?

1479
02:04:31,162 --> 02:04:35,360
l wanted to keep it at its
rightful place, the safe.

1480
02:04:47,178 --> 02:04:50,773
Why didn't you return this
money having taken it from Yadav?

1481
02:04:52,517 --> 02:04:54,849
You wanted to flee
with the money, right?

1482
02:04:57,188 --> 02:04:59,782
So that you could
start afresh with Anna!

1483
02:05:16,408 --> 02:05:19,468
Ma'am.. - The bodies of Anna
and Sean Verghese are inside.

1484
02:05:20,311 --> 02:05:22,380
Register the case that..

1485
02:05:22,480 --> 02:05:25,784
..Anna and Sean Verghese were
Subhash Yadav's accomplices..

1486
02:05:25,884 --> 02:05:28,286
..and were trying to commit a
fraud by posing their fake deaths.

1487
02:05:28,386 --> 02:05:31,189
On inspector Siddharth's
attempt to try and arrest them..

1488
02:05:31,289 --> 02:05:34,747
..they tried to kill him..

1489
02:05:35,226 --> 02:05:37,195
..but died in the ensuing encounter.

1490
02:05:37,295 --> 02:05:39,320
ls that clear?
- Yeah.

1491
02:05:46,438 --> 02:05:48,167
Sonia!

1492
02:05:49,441 --> 02:05:50,475
Sonia!

1493
02:05:50,575 --> 02:05:52,839
Hey, Mehra! Where is your man?

1494
02:05:53,344 --> 02:05:55,904
What were you saying?

1495
02:05:56,247 --> 02:05:58,216
You wanted to see
what l am capable of!

1496
02:05:58,316 --> 02:06:01,152
Where is my money? Give me the
money. Malhotra, arrest him.

1497
02:06:01,252 --> 02:06:04,322
Hello! Why do you
stand as if giving a pose?

1498
02:06:04,422 --> 02:06:06,686
Just a minute.. l am dead tired.

1499
02:06:07,459 --> 02:06:11,763
Siddharth, where is this
63rd Old Road in Panjim?

1500
02:06:11,863 --> 02:06:15,196
James, l never said it
to be 63rd. lt is 53rd.

1501
02:06:15,366 --> 02:06:18,670
You had asked me to go
to 63rd Old Road, Panjim..

1502
02:06:18,770 --> 02:06:21,239
..and give this
money to that swine Shah.

1503
02:06:21,339 --> 02:06:22,507
What?

1504
02:06:22,607 --> 02:06:24,268
James.. look behind!

1505
02:06:25,477 --> 02:06:28,207
Oh.. Mr. Swine.. l mean Mr. Shah!

1506
02:06:28,379 --> 02:06:32,183
Here, take this. Keep them,
they are yours.

1507
02:06:32,283 --> 02:06:33,385
Check it.

1508
02:06:33,485 --> 02:06:35,687
Yeah sure, go ahead.
Full 8.7 million.

1509
02:06:35,787 --> 02:06:38,857
lf you find a few thousand less,
feel free to call me.

1510
02:06:38,957 --> 02:06:40,948
Ok.. bye!

1511
02:07:15,326 --> 02:07:17,228
No, Sonia..

1512
02:07:17,328 --> 02:07:19,319
..l won't let you go.

1513
02:07:20,431 --> 02:07:23,594
l have learnt what
life without you means.

1514
02:07:25,537 --> 02:07:27,767
Such a strange joke that
life has played on me.

1515
02:07:28,673 --> 02:07:31,005
l stopped you from working..

1516
02:07:31,543 --> 02:07:34,011
..and the same work has saved me.

1517
02:07:36,548 --> 02:07:38,778
You have liberated me, by
bestowing this new life to me, Sonia.

1518
02:07:40,552 --> 02:07:42,782
Today l have learnt..

1519
02:07:43,555 --> 02:07:45,284
..why love turns into poison.

1520
02:07:47,358 --> 02:07:51,294
This 'l' ruins everything.

1521
02:07:52,463 --> 02:07:55,455
lt poisons the relations.

1522
02:07:57,368 --> 02:08:00,701
Sonia, henceforth l will follow you..

1523
02:08:01,706 --> 02:08:06,040
..because only 'you' will
remain in this relationship.

1524
02:08:07,378 --> 02:08:09,312
And not 'l'.

1525
02:08:11,716 --> 02:08:13,707
l love you a lot.

1526
02:08:16,387 --> 02:08:18,321
l love you.

1527
02:08:19,591 --> 02:08:22,651
Why did you delay it
so much, Siddharth?

1528
02:08:27,398 --> 02:08:29,389
l was also to be blamed.

1529
02:08:30,401 --> 02:08:33,336
My ego had blinded me.

1530
02:08:35,406 --> 02:08:38,309
l couldn't understand..

1531
02:08:38,409 --> 02:08:41,813
..that if l couldn't make
this relationship successful..

1532
02:08:41,913 --> 02:08:45,349
..then l could do it
with no other relationship.

1533
02:08:48,620 --> 02:08:50,388
l love you, Siddharth!

1534
02:08:50,488 --> 02:08:56,327
l will dwell in your heart!

1535
02:08:56,427 --> 02:09:02,333
And bedeck myself with your dreams.

1536
02:09:02,433 --> 02:09:06,096
l take an oath on you!

1537
02:09:08,439 --> 02:09:14,345
l take an oath to
turn the tide of fate.

1538
02:09:14,445 --> 02:09:17,348
lf you become mine..

1539
02:09:17,448 --> 02:09:21,384
..l will let go of the world.

1540
02:09:47,478 --> 02:09:54,407
l won't watch any
beauty without you.

1541
02:09:59,490 --> 02:10:06,397
l won't watch any
beauty without you.

1542
02:10:06,497 --> 02:10:12,403
l won't look back again at
something that you don't like.

1543
02:10:12,503 --> 02:10:15,939
A mirror that doesn't
reflect your face..

1544
02:10:18,509 --> 02:10:21,412
A mirror that doesn't
reflect your face..

1545
02:10:21,512 --> 02:10:24,482
..will be broken by me.

1546
02:10:24,582 --> 02:10:27,418
lf you become mine..

1547
02:10:27,518 --> 02:10:31,614
..l will let go of the world.

1548
02:11:14,565 --> 02:11:21,232
l will immerse you in
my heart in such a way.

1549
02:11:26,577 --> 02:11:32,650
l will immerse you in
my heart in such a way.

1550
02:11:32,750 --> 02:11:38,556
That your fragrance
will become mine.

1551
02:11:38,656 --> 02:11:42,524
l will make such a
relation with you..

1552
02:11:44,695 --> 02:11:51,035
..which can't be
broken by the Lord even.

1553
02:11:51,135 --> 02:11:53,571
lf you become mine..

1554
02:11:53,671 --> 02:11:57,108
..l will let go of the world.

1555
02:11:57,208 --> 02:12:03,114
l will break off all relations
with the world upon getting you.

1556
02:12:03,214 --> 02:12:05,917
lf you become mine..

1557
02:12:06,017 --> 02:12:09,187
..l will let go of the world.

1558
02:12:09,287 --> 02:12:12,023
lf you become mine..

1559
02:12:12,123 --> 02:12:16,059
..l will let go of the world.
