1
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:48,280
Shamitabh! Shamitabh!

2
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:50,788
We are at the grand
success party of LIFEBUOY...

3
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,751
A film with a rank newcomer...

4
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:54,690
who has taken bollywood by storm

5
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:56,227
Javed sir... Javed sir...

6
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:57,728
This is the beginning of a storm...

7
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:02,757
A storm that comes once in 40 years...

8
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:06,233
and changes the landscape

9
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:09,001
$10 Million in its opening weekend!!!

10
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:11,167
A new Superstar is
born in Bollywood!!!

11
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:13,069
Mr.Bhatt... Mr.Bhatt...

12
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,204
He doesn't have a great physique...

13
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:16,144
He is not very tall...

14
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:18,080
and looks very ordinary

15
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,210
So what makes him
the hottest thing today ?

16
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:23,777
The answer is in your question

17
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:27,023
If he had all this,
how would he be different ?

18
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:27,752
Ekta Ma'am...Ekta Ma'am

19
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:29,187
You are a marketing genius

20
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:31,195
Will the film benefit
from the brand Lifebuoy...

21
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:32,491
or the brand benefit from the film?

22
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:35,294
All I know is that the
industry has benefitted...

23
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:36,527
from SHAMITABH!!!

24
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:40,094
A few clays ago,
Nobody knew his name...

25
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,198
Today he is the talk of the town !

26
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,570
Shamitabh!

27
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:47,568
Shamitabh rocks!!

28
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:48,612
Mr.Boney Kapoor... Mr.Boney Kapoor...

29
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,808
While watching the very first
scene of the film, I told my wife...

30
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:52,073
'this boy is dynamite'

31
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:53,209
What a voice!

32
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:54,274
What intensity!

33
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:03,285
It's getting very late...

34
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:17,002
Greetings...

35
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,703
This is Shamitabh speaking

36
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,705
I welcome you all

37
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:26,179
You are searching for me...

38
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,776
I am waiting for you here

39
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:49,606
Thanks.

40
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:14,755
(Sound of gargling )

41
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:27,773
Seems like the mic is
trying to express a problem

42
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:32,216
Hi! Hello! Greetings and Welcome

43
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:36,111
Thank you so much
for appreciating LIFEBUOY

44
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,590
An actor is just a medium...

45
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,089
to deliver the director's
thoughts and the writer's words...

46
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:44,095
to an audience

47
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:45,625
Usually...

48
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,163
directors don't hit the gym...

49
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,290
writers are not well groomed...

50
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:51,165
so the camera doesn't
like them very much

51
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,326
Thank God !

52
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,433
Else, an actor like
me would be jobless

53
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,536
Ladies & Gentlemen

54
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:01,442
The creator of 'LIFEBUOY'

55
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,048
Hello!

56
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:15,121
You had the choice
of casting any big star...

57
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,988
why did you choose a new face ?

58
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:21,396
Every big star begins as a new face

59
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:24,566
Sir...Shamitabh sir...

60
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:25,500
Sir... Sir.. Sir

61
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:26,537
Shamitabh sir...

62
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:27,628
You got the news?

63
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:28,638
What news sir?

64
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:31,301
Within 3 clays of the
release of my first film...

65
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:34,043
I have been 'knighted'
by The Queen of England !

66
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,341
What ?

67
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:37,211
Sir Anthony Hopkins...

68
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:39,107
Sir Richard Attenborough...

69
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,776
Sir Elton John...

70
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:42,749
they must be called 'Sir'...

71
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,088
I am miles away from 'Knighthood'

72
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:48,548
Why are you calling me 'Sir'...

73
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:49,751
Sir?

74
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:54,554
Shamitabh! One question!

75
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:55,292
Yes?

76
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:56,464
Sir...

77
00:05:57,257 --> 00:05:58,099
Sorry...

78
00:05:58,225 --> 00:06:01,172
You were kept away from
The promotions of this film...

79
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:01,999
Why?

80
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:04,269
My director and producer feel...

81
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:07,172
that what you get
for 'free' has no value

82
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:11,072
Nothing like the pleasure
of paying money to 'see' on screen...

83
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:12,479
Sir, sir, sir, sir

84
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:15,587
Mumbai is the capital
of Bollywood & Maharashtra

85
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:17,679
Why has it taken a
‘Maharashtrian’ this long...

86
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,382
to be a bollywood superstar ?

87
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,658
Go and ask the film industry...

88
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,126
What took them so long to find me

89
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,391
Go and ask the world...

90
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:34,399
What took them so
long to hear my voice

91
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:36,566
Go and ask the dreams...

92
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,269
What took them so long to come true ?

93
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:42,605
And then...

94
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:44,680
And then...

95
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,751
So, kids, tell me.

96
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,548
Who is this?

97
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:52,188
Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi

98
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:55,424
Ben Kingsley
Who is Gandhiji?

99
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:56,756
Father of the Nation!!!

100
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:00,664
Hero

101
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:02,989
What did we achieve because of him?

102
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:04,330
Independence

103
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,404
Oscar

104
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:12,307
Daanish!

105
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:14,679
What is this awwwvvwww?

106
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:18,312
You think you can escape
Because you can't speak ?

107
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,712
Write the answer on the board

108
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:20,644
Get up!

109
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:23,511
No one else must answer

110
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,217
Who was Gandhiji's wife?

111
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,150
No one must answer!

112
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:38,160
Rohini Hattangadi?

113
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,069
You bunk school...

114
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,039
..watch movies all the time...

115
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:45,098
Because your father is dead...

116
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:46,109
And you can't speak...

117
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,544
we let you attend school...

118
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:51,275
so that you can at least
listen and learn !

119
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:53,011
What will you become
by watching films ?

120
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,109
A Hero ?

121
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:57,485
What ?

122
00:07:58,078 --> 00:07:59,250
You will become a hero ?

123
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,991
Show us

124
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,388
you've learnt nothing
from your teacher...

125
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,154
show us what you
have learnt from films

126
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,293
what ?

127
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:11,997
The silent film era is over...

128
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,239
"what is the scene ?"

129
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:21,272
Look!

130
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:23,607
Hero is asking for a script

131
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:26,684
Ok ! Your mother is dead

132
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,582
Action...

133
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:33,757
Come on, do it.

134
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:54,372
What...what is he saying?

135
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,303
(friend whispers) You...

136
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:56,339

137
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:57,397
mother...

138
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:58,271
Sir!

139
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:00,206
You killed my mother...

140
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:02,068
Are you crazy?

141
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:03,272
what are you saying ?

142
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:08,115
Stay there...

143
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,051
Stop!

144
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,651
Leave.. 
eave..
Stop him. What is he doing?

145
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,354
Leave. Leave him.

146
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,394
Leave him.

147
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:23,795
Sir... I will kill you...

148
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:38,545
How was that!

149
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,336
Film is love...

150
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:03,499
Film is passion...

151
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:04,701
Film is pain...

152
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:05,742
Film is the cure...

153
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,273
Film is a blessing...

154
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,506
Film is the way to fly every friday

155
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,777
Film is the secret of happiness...

156
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,416
Film is pride...

157
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,343
Film is the father of life...

158
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,016
we are all the children of film...

159
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,218
Film is life...

160
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:24,422
Film is the soul...

161
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:29,024
salute film... salute film...

162
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:30,193
Film is love...

163
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:31,360
Film is passion...

164
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:32,562
Film is pain...

165
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:33,603
Film is the cure...

166
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,139
Film is a blessing...

167
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,301
Film is the way to fly every friday

168
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,537
Film is the secret of happiness...

169
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,204
Film is pride...

170
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:45,147
Film is the father of life...

171
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,617
we are all the children of film...

172
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:49,483
Film is life...

173
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:52,088
Film is the soul...

174
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:56,661
Salute film... salute film...

175
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,227
How will you become a hero?

176
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,729
I mean...

177
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:10,029
Without speaking a word...

178
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,167
you can shake the world...

179
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:15,770
but which heroine will
work with a hero of your size ?

180
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:17,045
Tell me?

181
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,431
No No Doctor...

182
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:43,064
nothing is wrong with me...

183
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,598
I will just keep coming here...

184
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:46,268
just give me some
harmless medicines...

185
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,036
Why?

186
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,340
If I don't pretend to be ill,

187
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:50,711
he will run away to Mumbai....

188
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,147
to be an actor...

189
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:53,509
Film is love...

190
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:54,711

you don't have any film connections
how did you get this role?

291
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:08,347

weighs about 51 kgs,
you don't need any connections

00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:33,572
He went inside the vanity

304
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,077
Who are you?

305
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,577

How will the other
actors perform with him?

334
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:35,589
What will they hear?
How will they get their cues ?

374
00:24:44,617 --> 00:24:46,062
I would still be dreaming...

375
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:47,791
if I relied only on talent

376
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:53,066
More than talent... I had the desire

I really wanted to be an actor

378
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:02,703

00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:12,119
What are you doing in
Finland for so many clays ?

383
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,316
I thought I would attend
the conference for a clay...

384
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,724
and then escape on
some Scandinavian cruise

385
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:19,189
But for the first time in 30 years...

386
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:21,424
I found a medical
conclave so interesting

387
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:22,625
that I couldn't move

388
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,725
Laryngology and interesting?

389
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,231
I heard something
Absolutely mind blowing

390
00:25:27,293 --> 00:25:29,466
lam about to visit
their research centre

391
00:25:29,595 --> 00:25:32,166
See, what they are
doing is they are testing..

392
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:44,045
Has he gone back home?

393
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:46,055
I wish I could help him...

394
00:25:46,612 --> 00:25:47,682
You...

395
00:25:48,147 --> 00:25:49,785
..may be able to help him

396
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,325
Nurse... Where is he ?

397
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,457
He has left !

398
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:01,501
Hello...

399
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,197
Yes, madam!

400
00:26:02,261 --> 00:26:03,069
Okay I will check

401
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:03,572
Hello...

402
00:26:03,629 --> 00:26:05,540
Anyone hiding in the vanity van?

403
00:26:26,352 --> 00:26:27,262
Hero...

404
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,325
You don't have a passport right ?

405
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:37,332
Even your turn is at 48 frames !

406
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:39,474
You were born to be a hero man!

407
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:09,603
I am Dr. Kumar

408
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:13,108
This is the world's most
advanced voice research centre

409
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:14,007
Good morning.

410
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:15,977
You will discover
how technology can...

411
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:18,242
help the speech impaired

412
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,505
This way.

413
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,515
Bilateral Abductor Palsy

414
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:25,987
Clearly, his vocal
Cords are totally paralysed

415
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,187
It's a simple procedure

416
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,397
A micro voice processor...

417
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:41,063
will be implanted in your throat

418
00:27:41,293 --> 00:27:43,637
Initially you will
feel uncomfortable...

419
00:27:43,729 --> 00:27:45,037
but then it will be fine

420
00:27:57,476 --> 00:27:58,477
What's your name?

421
00:27:58,677 --> 00:27:59,781
Daanish!

422
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:01,551
Daanish

423
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,018
Move your lips

424
00:28:06,085 --> 00:28:07,564
What's your name?

425
00:28:07,953 --> 00:28:09,296
Daanish

426
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:10,626
Daanish

427
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:15,561
Daanish

428
00:28:16,128 --> 00:28:17,402
Daanish

429
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,411
Daanish!

430
00:28:23,469 --> 00:28:25,142
Daanish!

431
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:27,309
Daanish.

432
00:28:31,577 --> 00:28:32,715
Daanish

433
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:34,623
Daanish

434
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:40,058
Welcome to Live Voice
Transfer Technology

435
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:41,760
This gadget is like...

436
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:46,093
..a bluetooth device of a mobile phone

437
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:47,533
But there is no phone

438
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,206
All the technology is in this

439
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:51,673
Within a 400 meter radius...

440
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,232
wherever you are...

441
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:54,709
whether it's a sound proof room...

442
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,746
or a I"IO network zone...

443
00:28:57,002 --> 00:29:01,974
I can hear all voices
and sounds around you

444
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,383
and when I speak...

445
00:29:03,442 --> 00:29:06,218
you can hear my clear voice

446
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:07,655
minus all other sounds

447
00:29:07,713 --> 00:29:10,250
My voice will also be received...

448
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:13,319
by the micro voice
processor in your throat

449
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:17,025
There's a motion sensor
in your voice processor

450
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,298
When you move your lips...

451
00:29:19,358 --> 00:29:22,202
the motion sensor
will detect the movement

452
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:26,002
And the voice that your
voice processor has received...

453
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:27,202
will come out of your mouth...

454
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:30,371
through a hi-fidelity micro speaker...

455
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:32,039
absolutely clear

456
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:33,042
Today...

457
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:36,052
I can lend you my voice... Live!

458
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:38,551
Two cappuccinos. two twasence.

459
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:39,987

00:29:40,012 --> 00:29:43,391
3 blue brine with chocolate Sauce. 4 apro
tarts & 6 ginger breads. 12 vanilla doughnuts

461
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,724
No, actually, make that 6 strawberry
3 Vanilla 3 doughnuts.

462
00:29:49,655 --> 00:29:52,534
To sync your lip movement
with the voice...

463
00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:54,093
..is an art...

464
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,105
Practice Practice and Practice!

465
00:29:56,295 --> 00:30:00,368
To sync your lip movement
with the voice is an art...

466
00:30:00,432 --> 00:30:02,673
Practice Practice and Practice!

467
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:04,580
If you don't want to speak...

468
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,638
don't open your mouth
when you hear the voice

469
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:07,546
Just shut up

470
00:30:07,706 --> 00:30:10,050
If you don't open your
Mouth for sometime...

471
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:12,315
the voice that is stored
in your voice processor...

472
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:14,050
will be automatically erased

473
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,555
Now all you need is a good voice...

474
00:30:16,615 --> 00:30:20,028
with whom you can
have a good understanding

475
00:30:20,853 --> 00:30:21,593
Sorry...

476
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:22,629
I apologise...

477
00:30:22,688 --> 00:30:23,792
Please forgive me

478
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,735
Forgiveness is in demand

479
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,136
I will give you some options

480
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,567
Whoever seeks forgiveness...

481
00:30:30,062 --> 00:30:31,234
Forgiveness is in demand

482
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:32,206
must charge for it

483
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:33,299
Whoever seeks forgiveness...

484
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:34,708
Should be made to pay

485
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:35,676
By asking for forgiveness

486
00:30:35,734 --> 00:30:37,611
the pressure moves to the forgiver...

487
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,376
to be a good human being...

488
00:30:39,438 --> 00:30:40,348
pressure...

489
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:41,145
Oh sorry!

490
00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:42,716
I will finish my work and come.

491
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:44,747
Really, quite simple.

492
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:46,147
Baby, I can't come.

493
00:30:56,088 --> 00:30:57,431
My Hero..

494
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:00,064
You have the talent...

495
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,137
the technology...

496
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:04,064
the tantrums too...

497
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:07,205
but who the hell
has your voice man?

498
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:08,676
I have...

499
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:10,541
a bottle...

500
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:12,071
a glass...

501
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,741
water...
thirst...

502
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,411
snacks...
chicken...

503
00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:23,056
But who the hell has my drink man?

504
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:28,323
Shamitabh... Shamitabh...

505
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,591
people are crazy about your voice

506
00:31:30,656 --> 00:31:32,465
Do you also feel that your voice...

507
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:34,333
..is the reason for your success ?

508
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:37,070
No.. no...

509
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:38,307
It's all my...

510
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:39,364
good looks

511
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:40,341
I am good looking

512
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:41,070
Why?

513
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:42,237
You don't think I am handsome?

514
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:43,539
Come on guys...

515
00:31:43,602 --> 00:31:46,082
My face is getting
an inferiority complex

516
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,481
Right?

517
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:49,175
Right?
Ya

518
00:31:49,775 --> 00:31:52,449
Only the media can
create a rift between...

519
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:54,548
..a man's face and his voice !

520
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:57,627
Sir, sir, sir...

521
00:31:58,183 --> 00:32:00,060
We have spoken enough

522
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:01,664
It is time to party

523
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:03,327
My throat has dried up

524
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:04,594
Thank you ladies and gentleman

525

Enjoy the Party

527
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:17,278
Hello...

528
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:21,215
lam going to pee...
keep your mouth closed

529
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:24,718
Else, 'No. 1' will have
a new meaning in Bollywood

530
00:32:29,014 --> 00:32:31,722
Who has the drink?

531
00:33:39,284 --> 00:33:42,231
Can we speak to you for two minutes?

532
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:52,037
Serve the tea on my table

533
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:07,221
Will you boys have tea?

534
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:09,753
Excuse me!

535
00:34:10,015 --> 00:34:11,187
lam a girl...

536
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,051
Girl !

537
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,255
3 teas

538
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:27,710
Are you the person
who does the burials ?

539
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:30,542
I don't have the license for that

540
00:34:30,702 --> 00:34:31,578
He does...

541
00:34:32,337 --> 00:34:34,078
He is my land lord

542
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:36,148
He sends people...

543
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:37,585
from the land to the lord

544
00:34:38,343 --> 00:34:40,084
lam his paying guest

545
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,685
Where in Mumbai do you get a house...

546
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,249
with such a big garden...

547
00:34:44,316 --> 00:34:46,057
for $8 a month ?

548
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:48,789
Don't you...

549
00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:51,232
get scared here?

550
00:34:51,623 --> 00:34:54,035
Fear exists in places where people die

551
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:56,103
Nobody dies in the graveyard

552
00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:58,602
they die...

553
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:00,199
and arrive here

554
00:35:04,169 --> 00:35:06,342
You should be afraid outside...

555
00:35:08,006 --> 00:35:09,246
Outside

556
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:19,655
Can't we sit somewhere else?

557
00:35:20,018 --> 00:35:21,224
Why? What's the problem here?

558
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:24,165
It's someone's grave

559
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,166
It's not correct

560
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:27,462
It's empty

561
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,662
Reserved for me

562
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:42,109
Are you mute?

563
00:35:45,544 --> 00:35:47,217
Subtitle please.

564
00:35:54,419 --> 00:35:55,159
What is this?

565
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,756
Non disclosure agreement

566
00:35:57,122 --> 00:35:58,192
What?

567
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:00,503
What we are about to tell you...

568
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:02,095
..is confidential

569
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,131
so you will have to sign
this agreement before...

570
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:08,210
One minute

571
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:09,040
You...

572
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,579
..want to speak to me

573
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:11,545
Yes.

574
00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:15,517
And I have to sign an
agreement to listen to You ?

575
00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:17,211
Yes!

576
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:19,653
Did you get that?

577
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,424
I don't want to listen to you
No listening...

578
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:24,692
No signing!

579
00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:30,525
What's this nonsense?

580
00:36:30,589 --> 00:36:31,727
What is this nonsense ?

581
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,040
He wants to be an actor

582
00:36:42,334 --> 00:36:44,746
In case he becomes a superstar...

583
00:36:45,003 --> 00:36:46,243
just for safety

584
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:52,047
Your voice sounds good
from his mouth, right?

585
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:55,057
My voice will sound
good even from a dog's mouth

586
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,054
Sign over...

587
00:36:57,782 --> 00:36:58,385
Tell me!

588
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:01,021
What is in your ear...
a similar device is in his ear

589
00:37:01,086 --> 00:37:03,327
Whoever speaks to him...
you can hear them

590
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:06,062
and your reply will get
stored in his voice processor

591
00:37:06,124 --> 00:37:07,330
When he opens his mouth...

592
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:09,338
your voice will come out

593
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:17,163
[A famous dialogue from
the Hindi film <i>'</i> Mughal-E-Azam ']

594
00:37:29,514 --> 00:37:30,618
What happened?

595
00:37:32,284 --> 00:37:35,128
Technology does not like
Mughal-E-Azam dialogues?

596
00:37:37,522 --> 00:37:39,365
No chance!

597
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:45,425
[A famous dialogue from
the Hindi film <i>'</i> Mughal-E-Azam ']

598
00:37:58,610 --> 00:37:59,645
What happened?

599
00:38:00,512 --> 00:38:03,982
Technology does not like
Mughal-E-Azam dialogues?

600
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,256
No chance!

601
00:38:12,557 --> 00:38:16,664
Your voice is coming
from inside him.

602
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:21,500
I think he is swallowed
your mobile phone.

603
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:23,011
$0..

604
00:38:23,101 --> 00:38:24,079
What is your name?

605
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,342
Amitabh !
Mr. Amitabh Sinha!

606
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:28,174
So Mr. Amitabh...

607
00:38:29,207 --> 00:38:31,244
Will you be his voice?

608
00:38:36,014 --> 00:38:37,516
What's your weight?

609
00:38:39,017 --> 00:38:40,087
54?

610
00:38:41,086 --> 00:38:42,030
<i>59?</i>

611
00:38:43,121 --> 00:38:45,328
My voice is heavier than that

612
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:48,028
That's the beauty

613
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:51,063
A heavy voice is normal
On your kind of body

614
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,275
But on his face it'll stand out

615
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:55,741
People will be fans of your voice

616
00:39:39,344 --> 00:39:41,085
40 years ago...

617
00:39:41,146 --> 00:39:44,127
I had also come to Mumbai to be a hero

618
00:39:44,182 --> 00:39:45,320
What!

619
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:50,090
To be a hero

620
00:39:52,257 --> 00:39:54,396
Studio to studio...

621
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:58,767
Studio to studio...

622
00:39:59,197 --> 00:40:01,006
Not just studios...

623
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,678
Even radio rejected me

624
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:08,212
..because of this voice...

625
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:16,148
For the hero's role my
voice sounded like a villain's

626
00:40:17,215 --> 00:40:19,695
For the villain's role this voice...

627
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:25,193
..made the hero's voice sound weaker

628
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:29,663
The voice that made me a zero...

629
00:40:31,062 --> 00:40:33,133
..combined with this face of yours...

630
00:40:33,198 --> 00:40:35,075
ls going to make you a hero?

631
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,269
Right now he is a charity case.

632
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:39,441
But..

633
00:40:39,504 --> 00:40:42,075
...you'll get a share of what he earns.

634
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:46,352

635
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:52,354

Ok. 15% come on...that's fair

638

Don't be cheap!

639
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,039
I'm watching a film.

640
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:11,178

All the big people
of this great industry...

643
00:41:22,247 --> 00:41:26,457

of my 'F'ing voice...

..are now being 'F'ed by the same voice

645
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:36,471
Opening scene

646
00:41:41,032 --> 00:41:42,102
Feels good...

647
00:41:43,468 --> 00:41:44,572
Feels good...

648
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:46,180

00:42:03,655 --> 00:42:04,759
Don't take up anything else...

660
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:07,025

662
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,498
I spoke to Ranbir...

663
00:42:10,562 --> 00:42:12,564
He is free in 2017

664
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,405
Trying to meet Hrithik also...

665
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:15,341

666
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,674
What's the story sir ?

667
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:25,721
Are you both making the film too?

668
00:42:25,777 --> 00:42:26,653
No.. No.. No....

669
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:27,712
This is a test...

670
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:30,282
Need something to show.

671
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:31,492
Please come.

672
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:33,326
What is this?

673
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:34,658
A small scene...

674
00:42:43,194 --> 00:42:44,070
Hello...

675
00:42:45,163 --> 00:42:46,574
The name is 'Lifebuoy'

676
00:42:47,098 --> 00:42:48,042
The job is...

677
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:50,342
ls this a scene or a soap?

678
00:43:03,648 --> 00:43:06,595
In her director's next film...

679
00:43:06,718 --> 00:43:08,129
The hero...

680
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,596
...eliminates rogues or
the germs of society...

681
00:43:10,655 --> 00:43:14,102
..and protects the nation's health

682
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:18,002
Yesterday I was bathing
with Lifebuoy soap...

683
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:19,334
..and had an idea

684
00:43:19,497 --> 00:43:21,568
This soap does the same...

685
00:43:22,033 --> 00:43:23,410
..protects health

686
00:43:24,302 --> 00:43:26,782
So why not call the hero 'Lifebuoy'

687
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:28,610
'Lifebuoy'

688
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,345
The boy who gives life to the nation..

689
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,020
..will kill...

690
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,720
..and exit in slow motion

691
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:37,485
Sound track will play...

692
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:41,356
Lifebuoy protects health...

693
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:45,692
..where there is Lifebuoy
there is health

694
00:43:45,757 --> 00:43:47,759
'Lifebuoy'

695
00:43:48,693 --> 00:43:50,604
We have to make an
audition so good that...

696
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:56,737
..the director who is dying
to work with Ranbir & Hrithik...

697
00:43:56,801 --> 00:44:00,044
...will happily delete
their numbers from his phone

698
00:44:04,242 --> 00:44:06,017
Can you hear his voice?

699
00:44:06,077 --> 00:44:09,581
With less alcohol and more focus...

700
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,558
..anybody can understand

701
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:25,297
One minute...

702
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:32,578
You will have to step back...

703
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:36,575
else double sound will be recorded

704
00:44:43,314 --> 00:44:44,156
Hello...

705
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,257

The job is to keep the nation healthy

708
00:44:59,797 --> 00:45:03,244
You want me to weaken
my voice to suit your face ?

709
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:09,583
The name is 'Lifebuoy'

710
00:45:10,308 --> 00:45:12,219
The job is to keep the nation healthy

711
00:45:12,343 --> 00:45:14,653
Are you strolling in the garden?

712
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:22,095
SubtitlemSubtitle

713
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:26,198
Want me to have one expression
all my life to suit your voice ?

714
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:29,293
This won't work

715
00:45:29,594 --> 00:45:31,733
He needs a different face,
not a voice !

716
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:33,365
Have you seen the mirror?

717
00:45:33,598 --> 00:45:35,771
My bass won't go with this face

718
00:45:46,377 --> 00:45:47,720
The name is 'Lifebuoy'

719
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:49,348

721
00:45:51,783 --> 00:45:53,490
Finally he's learning
to act otherwise...

722
00:45:53,551 --> 00:45:55,155

this is cool

730
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:14,677
nowadays they speak
casually like this in films

731
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,180
No...

732
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:19,517
Even the previous one was fine

733
00:46:20,044 --> 00:46:22,991

00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:28,594
This is the same mute guy right?

737
00:46:28,653 --> 00:46:29,495
No sir...

738
00:46:29,587 --> 00:46:30,998
He's a great actor

739
00:46:31,022 --> 00:46:33,332
He was just acting mute and testing me

740
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,003

741
00:46:58,282 --> 00:46:59,556

What an idea!

744
00:47:06,424 --> 00:47:07,402
It's your idea, sir...

745
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:10,200
No but what an interpretation!

746
00:47:10,261 --> 00:47:12,537
Actually bang on title for my film

747
00:47:12,597 --> 00:47:14,543
I want to meet this...

748
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:16,272
This is Daanish

749
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:18,507
Hi Daanish.

750
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:20,048
Pass me that test.

751
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:21,480

752
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:23,177
ls the Camera ready?

753
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:52,178
Being evil has made you ill.

754
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:55,044
don't worry.. I have the cure.

755
00:47:55,139 --> 00:47:57,210
One bullet and you will be Okay.

756
00:47:57,274 --> 00:47:59,151
You won't even need an injection...

757
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:04,583
Awesome! Dude!

758
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:05,956
Awesome!

759
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:07,688
Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!

760
00:48:08,686 --> 00:48:10,563
Awesome dude!

761
00:48:10,621 --> 00:48:13,067
Now we will have to
find a role for you...

762
00:48:13,124 --> 00:48:15,263
First let's find you some clothes

763
00:48:15,326 --> 00:48:16,396
Why.. why?

764
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:20,067
You're in the same black
t-shirt since I've seen you

765
00:48:20,197 --> 00:48:22,268
No no.. no.. no.. no...
I love only black...

766
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:23,243
I have only black...

767
00:48:23,301 --> 00:48:25,144
And I buy only black

768
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:26,313
But I was saying something...

769
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:27,110
Yes...

770
00:48:27,171 --> 00:48:28,309
A role for you...

771
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:29,442
What role?

772
00:48:29,507 --> 00:48:31,248
During filming...

773
00:48:31,309 --> 00:48:33,619
..how will you be around
to lend your voice...

774
00:48:33,678 --> 00:48:35,624
..without raising suspicion?

775
00:48:37,448 --> 00:48:38,426
Manager?

776
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:41,361
But a manager has
to speak to people".

777
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:43,660
And if the manager and the
star speak in the same voice...

778
00:48:43,721 --> 00:48:46,167
..the film industry will be shocked.

779
00:48:47,325 --> 00:48:49,601
So who stays around
a star all the time ?

780
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:51,265
Valet...peon is called a valet here

781
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:52,705
Valet...peon is called a valet here

782
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:54,031
Perfect role!

783
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:55,402
Name?

784
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:56,669
Think.. think.. think.. think...

785
00:48:57,435 --> 00:48:58,243
Robert ?

786
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:01,214
Hey! Stop the car!

787
00:49:02,073 --> 00:49:03,211
Stop the car! Stop the car!

788
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:05,352
O hello. Hello.

789
00:49:06,177 --> 00:49:07,952
Oh hello...

790
00:49:08,379 --> 00:49:11,326
All the big people
of this great industry...

791
00:49:11,382 --> 00:49:16,127
who threw you out because
of your 'F'ing voice...

792
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:21,995
..are waiting to be
'F'ed by the same voice

793
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,462
To do that... Won't you do this much ?

794
00:49:36,007 --> 00:49:37,111
Whisky

795
00:49:37,241 --> 00:49:38,242
Black

796
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:42,048
Now you have the money... Pay!

797
00:49:43,347 --> 00:49:46,157
You need to control your drinking

798
00:49:46,284 --> 00:49:47,627
Where am I drinking ?

799
00:49:48,219 --> 00:49:49,721
I never drink in the graveyard

800
00:49:50,054 --> 00:49:51,055
Of course you drink...

801
00:49:51,122 --> 00:49:52,658
in your $8 bungalow

802
00:49:53,057 --> 00:49:56,527
That is out of this graveyard area...

803
00:49:56,627 --> 00:49:59,369
I respect the dead, not the living

804
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:01,101
And let me tell you...

805
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:03,268
By stopping whisky suddenly...

806
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:05,211
..the liver might get a heart attack

807
00:50:06,637 --> 00:50:08,048
So no whisky... very risky....

808
00:50:08,105 --> 00:50:10,051
Body will shake, not the sound

809
00:50:10,474 --> 00:50:11,452
Hello...

810
00:50:13,177 --> 00:50:14,155
What?

811
00:50:15,146 --> 00:50:16,056

813
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:20,722

00:50:28,092 --> 00:50:28,695
Yes, sir

818
00:50:28,793 --> 00:50:29,464
Hello...

819
00:50:32,596 --> 00:50:33,802
Yes, sir...Daanish here

820
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:35,075
Daanish

821
00:50:35,466 --> 00:50:36,570
I've thought a lot

822
00:50:38,068 --> 00:50:38,409
I know Daanish...

823
00:50:38,469 --> 00:50:40,380
You will feel very sad... but...

824
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:41,705
I am sorry...

825
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:44,148
For the good of this film...

826
00:50:44,441 --> 00:50:45,442
Have to change...

827
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:47,054
Daanish...

828
00:50:47,578 --> 00:50:48,318
I am sorry...

829
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:49,647
You...

830
00:50:50,615 --> 00:50:52,822
...will have to change your name!

831
00:50:55,252 --> 00:50:56,595
Got you guys

832
00:50:57,087 --> 00:50:58,122
Daanish...

833
00:50:58,189 --> 00:51:00,601
..you think only you can act?

834
00:51:00,758 --> 00:51:01,998
Sir...

835
00:51:02,126 --> 00:51:04,299
this is not good for health.

836
00:51:05,463 --> 00:51:07,602
But seriously Daanish, think...

837
00:51:07,765 --> 00:51:09,676
Apparently there's
A numerology problem...

838
00:51:10,034 --> 00:51:11,513
I don't have a problem
with all this but...

839
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:14,549
..my producers believe in such things

840
00:51:14,672 --> 00:51:18,176
I also feel Daanish is
not a very powerful name...

841
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:19,648
You are a powerful actor...

842
00:51:19,777 --> 00:51:21,381
"but, DAANISH doesn't have the power...

843
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:22,651
that is in your voice...

844
00:51:23,113 --> 00:51:24,285
What do you say?

845
00:51:24,548 --> 00:51:25,492

Daanish...

849
00:51:29,653 --> 00:51:30,563
is weak

850
00:51:31,122 --> 00:51:34,467

854
00:51:41,632 --> 00:51:43,339
Daanish is a nice name

855
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:44,545

00:56:52,476 --> 00:56:53,682
What a star!

946
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:57,351
Go, everywhere,
where you receive appreciation.

947
00:56:57,514 --> 00:57:01,291
The style doesn't appear.

948
00:57:01,452 --> 00:57:05,229
This morning doesn't arrive daily.

949
00:57:05,455 --> 00:57:10,632
You have achieved fame.

950
00:57:12,229 --> 00:57:15,267
A bus conductor from
A village near lgatpuri..

951
00:57:15,332 --> 00:57:17,278
..has become a Superstar today

952
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,273
He was so quiet...

953
00:57:19,336 --> 00:57:20,542
..never used to talk...

954
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:22,208
Just like a mute guy...

955
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:24,548
And now he speaks such big dialogues

956
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:27,020
This chap's late father
helped him get a job...

957
00:57:27,077 --> 00:57:30,024
Did he once say "thank you"?

958
00:57:30,047 --> 00:57:31,151
He was so quiet...

959
00:57:31,215 --> 00:57:32,489
We really thought he was mute

960
00:57:32,549 --> 00:57:35,086
But he used to talk to me...

961
00:57:35,152 --> 00:57:38,326
He used to gossip a lot with me

962
00:57:38,388 --> 00:57:42,165
Sha Sha mi mi... What a star.

963
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:46,104
Go, everywhere,
where you receive appreciation.

964
00:58:05,282 --> 00:58:05,953
Stay here?

965
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:08,429
No... this house
does not have a garden

966
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:28,547
From the time it has seen you.

967
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:32,715
The camera sways.

968
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:36,185
Only you are in focus all the time.

969
00:58:36,713 --> 00:58:40,388
It has gone crazy for you.

970
00:58:40,551 --> 00:58:43,395
Whenever you are swayed.

971
00:58:44,588 --> 00:58:48,263
With your eyelids open.

972
00:58:48,492 --> 00:58:52,440
Come, your close up is needed.

973
00:58:52,663 --> 00:58:57,578
You have become famous everywhere.

974
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:12,524
You are great...

975
00:59:12,682 --> 00:59:16,721

976
00:59:19,223 --> 00:59:21,203

978
00:59:26,663 --> 00:59:28,006

00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:31,140

Have become a 'F'ing valet!

982
00:59:39,176 --> 00:59:42,646
I can hear the pain of your heart...

983
00:59:54,124 --> 00:59:56,104
Scotch...

984
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:57,666
me...

985
00:59:58,061 --> 00:59:59,233
Scotch...

986
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:02,107
Water...

987
01:00:02,165 --> 01:00:03,701
him

988
01:00:04,134 --> 01:00:05,511
mixing...

989
01:00:13,777 --> 01:00:15,518
What gives you the high?

990
01:00:17,013 --> 01:00:18,686
ls there any water...

991
01:00:19,316 --> 01:00:21,762
that gives you a high without whisky ?

992
01:00:22,486 --> 01:00:23,692
ls there?

993
01:00:24,521 --> 01:00:25,761
ls there?

994
01:00:27,324 --> 01:00:28,428
but...

995
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:32,363
whisky gives you
a high without water!

996
01:00:35,699 --> 01:00:37,372
Whisky!

997
01:00:39,570 --> 01:00:43,108
Water... needs whisky

998
01:00:45,275 --> 01:00:48,313
Whisky doesn't need anyone

999
01:00:55,685 --> 01:00:58,222
And to give away the award
for the best ' debut ' actor

1000
01:00:58,288 --> 01:01:01,326
May I please request Mr.
Rohit Shetty to come on stage

1001
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:08,175
And the award

1002
01:01:08,465 --> 01:01:10,308

1004
01:01:15,605 --> 01:01:17,050
Sidharth Dhawan!!!

1005
01:01:25,282 --> 01:01:27,262
Chill...you are the best

1006
01:01:27,317 --> 01:01:30,161
Rigged rigged... everything is rigged

1007
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:31,528
Best debut... balls!!!

1008
01:01:31,588 --> 01:01:33,397
Ssshhh...speak slowly

1009
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:38,267
Aamir khan does the right thing...

1010
01:01:38,328 --> 01:01:40,035
boycott all these bloody awards

1011
01:01:40,096 --> 01:01:41,166
It is all a fraud...

1012
01:01:41,231 --> 01:01:42,642
to increase Television ratings...

1013
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:44,679
they lure stars with awards

1014
01:01:44,768 --> 01:01:46,338
It's all a game of money

1015
01:01:46,403 --> 01:01:48,110
This is not about
talent and perfomance

1016
01:01:48,205 --> 01:01:50,151
As long as people watch such shows

1017
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,049
It will go on like this

1018
01:01:51,108 --> 01:01:52,451
Corruption
Bloody Corruption

1019
01:01:52,509 --> 01:01:54,113
Corruption here too

1020
01:01:54,311 --> 01:01:55,688
Even a film on Anna Hazare

1021
01:01:55,746 --> 01:01:57,453
will have to buy the awards

1022
01:01:57,514 --> 01:01:59,084
Awards!... Awards!

1023
01:01:59,149 --> 01:02:00,150
And the best 'actor' for 2013

1024
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:01,252
Fraud... This is fraud...

1025
01:02:01,318 --> 01:02:02,194
Do you call this an award

1026
01:02:02,252 --> 01:02:03,128
It's a bloody fraud...

1027
01:02:03,186 --> 01:02:04,187
Shamitabh.

1028
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:08,997
Yes, ladies & gentlemen

1029
01:02:09,159 --> 01:02:10,399

Shamitabh!

1033
01:02:15,032 --> 01:02:16,477
For his very first film.

1034
01:02:31,715 --> 01:02:33,490
Congratulations...

1035
01:02:41,191 --> 01:02:42,067
Thank you.

1036
01:02:44,527 --> 01:02:45,471
Thank you.

1037
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:46,699
Thank you.

1038
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:56,648
lam so proud of you

1039
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:59,111
You are truly God's gift to Cinema

1040
01:02:59,209 --> 01:03:00,654
Blessed with God's own Voice

1041
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:02,590
Bless you

1042
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:04,318
Take care of yourself...

1043
01:03:04,381 --> 01:03:05,724
And take care of this voice...

1044
01:03:13,123 --> 01:03:13,999
Bhimani sir..

1045
01:03:14,558 --> 01:03:16,003
it's a great script...

1046
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:18,696
but Clint Eastwood has already made it

1047
01:03:19,229 --> 01:03:20,105
fantastic film...

1048
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:21,408
"In the line of Fire"

1049
01:03:22,065 --> 01:03:23,567
we have the 'rights' sir...

1050
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:25,010
Idiot...

1051
01:03:25,235 --> 01:03:26,213
You're wrong...

1052
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:27,543
Who gave you the right?

1053
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:34,279
Sir...

1054
01:03:34,344 --> 01:03:37,120
I am getting the action
director of mission impossible.

1055
01:03:37,781 --> 01:03:39,351
Launch your son...

1056
01:03:39,416 --> 01:03:40,451
he looks like a star

1057
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:43,062
Thank you, sir.

1058
01:03:44,287 --> 01:03:45,027
Actually...

1059
01:03:45,455 --> 01:03:47,162
Lifebuoy was an action film...

1060
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:48,792
I want to do something different...

1061
01:03:49,092 --> 01:03:50,298
..a romantic film

1062
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:52,397
Superb...superb...

1063
01:03:53,196 --> 01:03:55,176
Very sweet love story...

1064
01:03:55,399 --> 01:03:58,403
But... I want to do more action

1065
01:03:59,536 --> 01:04:01,072
Premiere in Sundance...

1066
01:04:01,138 --> 01:04:02,344
..or Cannes...

1067
01:04:02,405 --> 01:04:03,975
I want to take it to all festivals

1068
01:04:04,007 --> 01:04:07,079
Eid...Diwali...Dushhera...Christmas...

1069
01:04:07,244 --> 01:04:10,088
I want to do films that
release on these festivals

1070
01:04:26,997 --> 01:04:28,999
Fantastic script...

1071
01:04:31,001 --> 01:04:32,605
..but for this role...

1072
01:04:35,405 --> 01:04:36,440
Let me see...

1073
01:04:38,008 --> 01:04:39,214
I think...

1074
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:41,784
You know who's perfect for this role?

1075
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:53,364
I think the person who
is perfect for this role..

1076
01:04:55,158 --> 01:04:56,501
Who's he?

1077
01:04:57,661 --> 01:04:59,607
I think..

1078
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:04,439
I want to do this role...

1079
01:05:04,501 --> 01:05:06,003
I will decide what I want to do

1080
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:07,412
Stop thinking for me...

1081
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:09,108
What I want is what will happen...

1082
01:05:09,172 --> 01:05:10,708
Just say what I want you
to say dammit

1083
01:05:13,209 --> 01:05:15,382
What a waste of energy

1084
01:05:16,513 --> 01:05:19,084
I can hear my voice too...

1085
01:05:20,617 --> 01:05:25,123
I must like the script, too...

1086
01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:28,494
I have to act too...

1087
01:05:30,994 --> 01:05:33,736
I am an Artist too !

1088
01:05:36,633 --> 01:05:39,773
I am SHAMITABH too!

1089
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:56,019
Are you alright, sir?

1090
01:05:56,419 --> 01:05:58,524
It's okay, sir. You take rest.

1091
01:05:58,688 --> 01:06:01,191
Yes, I will call you tomorrow.
Yes, sir.

1092
01:06:12,535 --> 01:06:14,481
When are we starting the film?
Shamitabh.

1093
01:06:28,518 --> 01:06:31,158
Full entertainment. Damn funny script

1094
01:06:31,521 --> 01:06:33,967
I read it. You must do it

1095
01:06:36,359 --> 01:06:38,498
Finish it by the time I come back.

1096
01:06:42,065 --> 01:06:42,941
What?

1097
01:06:47,904 --> 01:06:49,645
Enough of being Assistant Director

1098
01:06:50,573 --> 01:06:52,177
I want to make my own film.

1099
01:06:53,043 --> 01:06:54,454
I have to write.

1100
01:06:55,178 --> 01:06:56,680
I want to go somewhere.

1101
01:06:59,315 --> 01:07:00,316
It's time

1102
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:05,626
Of course, you can manage without me...

1103
01:07:06,056 --> 01:07:07,433
You are doing it quite beautifully.

1104
01:07:07,657 --> 01:07:11,230
Managing the world
and your co-superstar.

1105
01:07:14,564 --> 01:07:15,599
Where is he?

1106
01:07:26,442 --> 01:07:28,444
You like the script and he doesn't?

1107
01:07:29,178 --> 01:07:31,658
It's so tough to please one star..

1108
01:07:32,282 --> 01:07:35,957
How does one convince
two stars for the same role ?

1109
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:45,201
You'll keep growing..

1110
01:07:46,996 --> 01:07:48,669
..from superstar to super duper star...

1111
01:07:48,932 --> 01:07:50,138
..to super super duper star...

1112
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:51,938
while everyone else remain ADs ?

1113
01:07:52,368 --> 01:07:53,642
Selfish pig!

1114
01:07:54,304 --> 01:07:56,045
I want to make a film too

1115
01:08:04,013 --> 01:08:06,084
Will you act in my film?

1116
01:08:09,118 --> 01:08:10,256
Of course you will...

1117
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:12,027
You owe me so much!

1118
01:08:12,121 --> 01:08:13,293
Let me drive

1119
01:08:13,957 --> 01:08:15,698
You're a dangerous driver

1120
01:08:17,127 --> 01:08:18,333
Don't show off!

1121
01:08:18,394 --> 01:08:20,374
You have to live
till my film is complete.

1122
01:08:20,964 --> 01:08:22,500
After that who cares.

1123
01:08:23,266 --> 01:08:25,439
Wish I could get you a driver.

1124
01:08:27,003 --> 01:08:28,004
I know... I know...

1125
01:08:28,271 --> 01:08:31,582
He will have to sign
a confidentiality clause too.

1126
01:08:32,342 --> 01:08:33,377
Whatever.

1127
01:08:39,916 --> 01:08:42,226
Everyone looks slim in black...

1128
01:08:43,286 --> 01:08:45,926
Haven't I put on some weight?

1129
01:08:54,197 --> 01:08:55,676
Don't look at me like that

1130
01:08:57,367 --> 01:08:59,176
Camera is not rolling.

1131
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:01,607
This is real life.

1132
01:09:01,938 --> 01:09:05,442
lam not going to be
mesmerised like a stupid fan

1133
01:09:07,410 --> 01:09:09,287
You look like a monkey.

1134
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:13,586
I don't have the time
to close my eyes and carry on.

1135
01:09:15,251 --> 01:09:17,026
Focus on your work, monkey.

1136
01:09:17,086 --> 01:09:18,258
Let me focus too

1137
01:09:18,621 --> 01:09:20,123
I want to make a film...

1138
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:22,091
I want to go

1139
01:09:26,329 --> 01:09:34,043
When the video works
because of the audio..

1140
01:09:35,238 --> 01:09:37,309
...how can it be called a 'picture' ?

1141
01:09:37,907 --> 01:09:40,353
Think

1142
01:09:40,977 --> 01:09:43,014
When the video works
because of the audio...

1143
01:09:43,079 --> 01:09:45,025
When the video works
because of the audio...

1144
01:09:45,248 --> 01:09:47,626
how can it be called a 'picture' ?

1145
01:09:48,918 --> 01:09:50,295
Picture !

1146
01:09:50,954 --> 01:09:52,627
It is not picture...

1147
01:09:53,423 --> 01:09:54,401
It is mixture..

1148
01:09:54,624 --> 01:09:55,602
mixture..

1149
01:09:56,559 --> 01:09:57,537
Call..

1150
01:09:58,494 --> 01:10:00,496
Call picture a mixture

1151
01:10:02,032 --> 01:10:05,673
Else Bollywood go
Make wooden furniture

1152
01:10:18,314 --> 01:10:19,554
Everyone has come.

1153
01:10:23,686 --> 01:10:24,562
Good morning, sir

1154
01:10:26,089 --> 01:10:27,500
Sir has bought his own vanity van...

1155
01:10:27,557 --> 01:10:28,399
Great, isn't it ?

1156
01:10:28,458 --> 01:10:31,530
It's very expensive... Fully hi-tech

1157
01:10:32,495 --> 01:10:34,031
Come on, go back.

1158
01:11:02,625 --> 01:11:04,536
Bala, go and check the bulb.

1159
01:11:19,976 --> 01:11:21,478
Sir the shot is ready...

1160
01:11:22,946 --> 01:11:23,424
Hi.

1161
01:11:23,646 --> 01:11:24,181
Hi.

1162
01:11:24,681 --> 01:11:25,182
Hello

1163
01:11:25,381 --> 01:11:27,122
Silence please, going for rehearsal...

1164
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:28,091
standby...

1165
01:11:32,389 --> 01:11:33,527
and action !

1166
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:42,136
No problem. Take your time ,sir..

1167
01:11:42,198 --> 01:11:43,506
Take your time

1168
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:45,311
Ready when you are, sir

1169
01:11:45,902 --> 01:11:46,972
And action!

1170
01:11:56,446 --> 01:11:58,050
What happened?

1171
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:33,288
I'll go and check...

1172
01:12:33,883 --> 01:12:35,385
You like the script, you do it

1173
01:12:35,552 --> 01:12:36,895
I'm going

1174
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:41,497
I need to meet your boss

1175
01:12:46,596 --> 01:12:49,133
How dare you say yes when I said no?

1176
01:12:51,301 --> 01:12:52,905
What are you without me?

1177
01:12:54,237 --> 01:12:55,409
You say 'yes' with a text message?

1178
01:12:55,471 --> 01:12:57,109
Go do the film using text message

1179
01:12:58,274 --> 01:12:59,912
Without my voice...

1180
01:13:00,276 --> 01:13:01,653
..you are finished!

1181
01:13:02,612 --> 01:13:03,420
Finished!

1182
01:13:14,891 --> 01:13:16,063
If I am finished...

1183
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:19,072
Your voice will also be finished

1184
01:13:34,277 --> 01:13:38,555
I will have to save this rubbish film

1185
01:13:50,126 --> 01:13:52,504
You should marry me!

1186
01:13:52,995 --> 01:13:55,441
You should marry me!

1187
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:57,911
You should marry me!

1188
01:13:57,967 --> 01:13:58,536
Why?

1189
01:13:58,601 --> 01:14:00,877
Because your parents don't love you

1190
01:14:00,970 --> 01:14:01,471
Means?

1191
01:14:01,871 --> 01:14:02,508
What is your name?

1192
01:14:02,638 --> 01:14:03,548
Don't you know?

1193
01:14:03,606 --> 01:14:05,608
‘Geeta’...
Oh ‘Geeta’!

1194
01:14:05,875 --> 01:14:07,320
If your parents loved you...

1195
01:14:07,377 --> 01:14:09,015
..they wouldn't have named you ‘Geeta’

1196
01:14:09,078 --> 01:14:10,182
What's the problem with ‘Geeta’?

1197
01:14:10,246 --> 01:14:11,418
If you love somebody...

1198
01:14:11,481 --> 01:14:14,325
..you're ready to face
every challenge for them

1199
01:14:14,384 --> 01:14:15,988
It's a challenge
to find a good name...

1200
01:14:16,052 --> 01:14:18,123
..but your parents took the easy way out

1201
01:14:18,221 --> 01:14:19,894
‘Geeta’ is the most common name

1202
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:21,902
The first name that
comes to mind is ‘Geeta’...

1203
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:23,460
..thousands of women are named ‘Geeta’

1204
01:14:23,526 --> 01:14:26,166
Perhaps you were even born
at a nursing home called ‘Geeta’

1205
01:14:26,229 --> 01:14:27,469
Such lazy parents...

1206
01:14:27,530 --> 01:14:30,977
To not think of a unique
name for their only daughter...

1207
01:14:31,033 --> 01:14:32,137
..and just name her ‘Geeta’ !

1208
01:14:32,201 --> 01:14:33,612
I will call you Ta

1209
01:14:33,836 --> 01:14:34,837
Marry me 'Ta"...

1210
01:14:34,904 --> 01:14:36,884
and say 'Ta Ta' to your lazy parents

1211
01:14:36,939 --> 01:14:37,576
Cut it!

1212
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,183
Absolutely Fantastic!

1213
01:14:39,275 --> 01:14:39,946
Mindblowing !

1214
01:14:40,543 --> 01:14:41,886
You were just superb!

1215
01:14:42,111 --> 01:14:43,522
Absolutely fabulous

1216
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:45,587
You took the whole
scene to a different level

1217
01:14:45,915 --> 01:14:46,393
Thank you!

1218
01:14:46,449 --> 01:14:47,189
Thank you !

1219
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:49,059
Why are you saying thank you?

1220
01:14:49,285 --> 01:14:52,266
He's praising the dialogue delivery,
not your face.

1221
01:14:58,594 --> 01:14:59,572
Bye, sir.
- Greetings, sir.

1222
01:14:59,629 --> 01:15:00,903
Such a big star...

1223
01:15:00,963 --> 01:15:03,068
He never says a word when I do make-up

1224
01:15:03,132 --> 01:15:04,338
Trusts me completely...

1225
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:08,280
Very good man...he drops
his servant in his own car

1226
01:15:08,438 --> 01:15:11,180
But that old servant
ls completely crazy

1227
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:13,345
Keeps muttering to himself

1228
01:15:14,877 --> 01:15:16,982
Turn the AC off...

1229
01:15:21,651 --> 01:15:23,995
Relax. Relax.

1230
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:28,098
What is this?

1231
01:15:28,157 --> 01:15:29,397
An injection.

1232
01:15:29,458 --> 01:15:38,173
No doctor... please !

1233
01:15:38,301 --> 01:15:39,837
No injection!

1234
01:15:39,902 --> 01:15:42,508
Okay.. okay..

1235
01:15:43,339 --> 01:15:53,283
No... no injection !

1236
01:15:55,518 --> 01:15:58,431
It's over. It's over.

1237
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:12,307
No.. no.. no..

1238
01:16:30,019 --> 01:16:31,327
No need to clean up today.

1239
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:34,256
Today is the first
time he has spoken to me.

1240
01:16:35,625 --> 01:16:36,899
I'm okay.

1241
01:16:37,093 --> 01:16:39,664
I will go home,
bathe and come to the shoot

1242
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:44,571
Hello Shamitabh

1243
01:16:44,901 --> 01:16:45,936
Hello, sir...

1244
01:16:46,002 --> 01:16:46,537
How are you ?

1245
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:48,138
You don't sound okay.

1246
01:16:48,204 --> 01:16:49,274
Are you sick?

1247
01:16:50,139 --> 01:16:51,174
No, sir..

1248
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:54,346
My voice is down today

1249
01:16:55,912 --> 01:16:57,255
But I can come.

1250
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:58,220
No no...

1251
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:01,557
Don't bother...
I'll shoot other scenes...

1252
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:03,290
please rest.. don't worry

1253
01:17:05,321 --> 01:17:07,528
So much love for your voice

01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:10,403
I'm hungfyn-

1255
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:43,231
Hey, the water is very hot.
How do you make it cold?

1256
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:45,996
I am burnt.

1257
01:17:49,131 --> 01:17:50,166
What are you doing?

1258
01:17:58,474 --> 01:17:59,578
How are you?

1259
01:18:10,286 --> 01:18:11,526

1260
01:18:11,921 --> 01:18:12,626
Yes, sir

1261
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:13,632
I have an idea...

1262
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:15,464
Once you're okay....

1263
01:18:15,658 --> 01:18:18,639
I want to be the first director
to record a song in your voice.

1264
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:20,935
One song in your voice.

1265
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:23,135
it will be sensational sir

1266
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:24,542
Will do it sir...

1267
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:26,204

Sir...thank you so much sir

1269
01:18:32,375 --> 01:18:34,184
Don't be so tense

1270
01:18:35,578 --> 01:18:37,080
After listening to the song...

1271
01:18:37,146 --> 01:18:39,023
"people may throw shoes at you

1272
01:18:39,081 --> 01:18:40,219
That's all

1273
01:18:44,887 --> 01:18:47,060
You dare give me an injection?

1274
01:18:52,228 --> 01:18:53,104
Akshara?

1275
01:18:53,162 --> 01:18:54,607
Even I am not able
to get through to her...

1276
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:56,910
Maybe network problem in Sikkim...

1277
01:18:57,200 --> 01:19:00,374
Why go to Sikkim to write a script!

I've been rehearsing all week...

1292
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:22,458
what lyrics are these ?...
Piddly piddly ?

1293
01:20:23,285 --> 01:20:25,162
Piddly... english word sir...

1294
01:20:25,221 --> 01:20:25,961
means...

1295
01:20:26,055 --> 01:20:27,295
a small little...

1296
01:20:27,356 --> 01:20:29,962
inconsequential thing... sir

1297
01:20:30,092 --> 01:20:32,163
Everything is piddly
compared to love...

1298
01:20:32,228 --> 01:20:34,299
and these clays we
need a catch phrase sir

1299
01:20:34,430 --> 01:20:35,909
Thank you for your kind consideration

1301
01:20:37,533 --> 01:20:39,479
if I rehearse more my
voice will become piddly...

1302
01:20:39,535 --> 01:20:40,377
Let's do a take !

1303
01:20:40,436 --> 01:20:41,380
What's going on dude ?

1304
01:20:41,437 --> 01:20:42,381
Please please

1305
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:52,550
Such a Piddly thing...

1306
01:20:52,615 --> 01:20:54,891
What is there to feel shy...

1307
01:20:55,117 --> 01:20:57,063
Such a Piddly thing...

1308
01:20:59,054 --> 01:21:03,002

Everything is Piddly in love.

Such a Piddly thing...

1314
01:21:23,579 --> 01:21:25,456
What is there to feel shy...

1315
01:21:27,917 --> 01:21:31,592
I make the Piddly intensions come true.

1316
01:21:31,954 --> 01:21:33,399
Piddly intensions.

1317
01:21:33,856 --> 01:21:36,462

Amazing !

1319
01:21:47,603 --> 01:21:51,449
In every partnership, one partner...

1320
01:21:51,874 --> 01:21:55,253
is a little more
talented than the other

1321
01:22:26,408 --> 01:22:27,352
Just read this...

1322
01:22:30,212 --> 01:22:32,249
Mad idea sir... fantastic...

word into a brilliant idea

1324
01:22:55,304 --> 01:22:56,009

1325
01:22:56,071 --> 01:22:58,176
Listen. I have to pee

1326
01:22:59,608 --> 01:23:01,884
If you really love me...

1327
01:23:02,011 --> 01:23:03,490
find me a toilet

1328
01:23:04,613 --> 01:23:05,648
Please.

1329
01:23:08,617 --> 01:23:10,290
Such a Piddly thing...

1330
01:23:10,352 --> 01:23:12,662
What is there to feel shy...

1331
01:23:12,921 --> 01:23:14,628
Such a Piddly thing...

1332
01:23:17,026 --> 01:23:20,906
I make the Piddly intensions come true.

1333
01:23:20,963 --> 01:23:22,943
Piddly intensions.

1334
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:29,071
Love is crazy.

1335
01:23:29,238 --> 01:23:33,118
This business continues like this.

1336
01:23:33,242 --> 01:23:37,054
Everything is Piddly in love.

1337
01:23:37,246 --> 01:23:41,456
Such a Piddly thing.
What is there to feel shy?

1338
01:23:41,550 --> 01:23:43,154
Piddly intensions.

1339
01:23:45,587 --> 01:23:49,501
I make the Piddly intensions come true.

1340
01:23:49,558 --> 01:23:51,367
Piddly intensions.

1341
01:23:51,527 --> 01:23:54,201
Promises.. ands these desires..

1342
01:24:00,402 --> 01:24:04,873
What is this toilet nonsense
that you are shooting ?

1343
01:24:13,515 --> 01:24:14,186
What?

1344
01:24:17,253 --> 01:24:18,561
I should wear this and sleep ?

1345
01:24:27,329 --> 01:24:28,171
Hi!

1346
01:24:28,597 --> 01:24:29,302

1349
01:25:16,345 --> 01:25:19,918
Everything is Piddly in front of her.

1350
01:25:20,282 --> 01:25:23,957
Come. Come close.

1351
01:25:24,453 --> 01:25:27,991
Even the dreams are
Piddly in your presence.

1352
01:25:28,991 --> 01:25:32,939
Something that you will think someday,
I've thought of it.

1353
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:36,598
There's fun in going
beyond the thoughts.

1354
01:25:36,999 --> 01:25:41,141
Dreams you will see beyond the dreams.

1355
01:25:41,270 --> 01:25:45,013
There's a different feeling
going beyond the dreams.

1356
01:25:45,307 --> 01:25:46,411
Under the intoxication,
everything is Piddly..

1357
01:25:46,542 --> 01:25:47,282
Piss...

1358
01:25:48,076 --> 01:25:48,884
Piss

1359
01:25:49,345 --> 01:25:50,881
You have ruined my song !

1360
01:25:52,214 --> 01:25:53,386
Why did you ruin my song ?

1361
01:25:53,616 --> 01:25:55,960
Did I beg you to be your voice ?

1362
01:25:56,218 --> 01:25:58,061
Did I beg you to do this film ?

1363
01:25:58,553 --> 01:25:59,930
You begged me...

1364
01:26:00,055 --> 01:26:01,295
and I helped you

1365
01:26:01,890 --> 01:26:02,630
to save you...

1366
01:26:02,858 --> 01:26:04,860
to save your superstar image...

1367
01:26:05,594 --> 01:26:07,972
I was never interested
in singing this...

1368
01:26:08,564 --> 01:26:10,009
only this song...

1369
01:26:10,098 --> 01:26:11,941
could have saved your lousy film

1370
01:26:13,101 --> 01:26:15,172
You're so jealous of my voice...

1371
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:17,250
that you are willing
to destroy your own film ?

1372
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:19,610
You are the first beggar...

1373
01:26:19,875 --> 01:26:21,320
who is jealous of his saviour

1374
01:26:21,610 --> 01:26:22,987
You're just a cheap...

1375
01:26:23,045 --> 01:26:23,955
insecure...

1376
01:26:24,012 --> 01:26:24,547
Bastard

1377
01:26:24,613 --> 01:26:28,527
Such a Piddly thing.
What is there to feel shy?

1378
01:26:28,884 --> 01:26:30,363
Piddly intensions.

1379
01:26:32,621 --> 01:26:36,899
I make the Piddly intensions come true.

1380
01:26:36,992 --> 01:26:38,903
Piddly intensions.

1381
01:26:41,196 --> 01:26:42,436
ls bollywood changing...

1382
01:26:42,498 --> 01:26:44,444
from running around trees
to runnning around loos ?

1383
01:26:44,533 --> 01:26:46,103
What a brilliant original idea!

1384
01:26:46,168 --> 01:26:51,413
For years, heroines have run around
in chiffon sarees in the snow...

1385
01:26:51,473 --> 01:26:55,546
but nobody thought... in the cold
their bladders could be bursting too !

1386
01:28:10,952 --> 01:28:12,056

1405
01:29:25,060 --> 01:29:26,232

I forgot to bring my 'net' today

1416
01:29:45,547 --> 01:29:48,357
This is called acting

1417
01:29:48,583 --> 01:29:49,527
No hands...

1418
01:29:49,585 --> 01:29:50,393
no feet...

1419
01:29:50,452 --> 01:29:51,556

Why are you stuck there ?

1430
01:30:20,048 --> 01:30:21,118
Come down here

1431
01:30:23,585 --> 01:30:25,292
Shall I get you down here ?

1432
01:30:25,987 --> 01:30:28,263
You think you are a big VIP ?

1433
01:30:28,490 --> 01:30:30,993

1434

Come down.

1438
01:30:44,973 --> 01:30:47,886
Come. Come. - You can't get it down.

1439
01:30:47,943 --> 01:30:51,220
No... no...

Don't... don't touch me

1444

How dare you touch me

01:31:02,891 --> 01:31:08,102
Don't... don't touch me

1446
01:31:11,066 --> 01:31:12,238

Hi, dad.

1450
01:31:53,442 --> 01:31:56,423
Shamitabh's valet threatens
to shoot a cop in London

1451
01:31:56,478 --> 01:31:58,458
The Ambassador's
office in London says...

1452
01:31:58,513 --> 01:32:00,584
the incident was an unfortunate event

1453
01:32:01,583 --> 01:32:02,926

Sir...about your valet's
behaviour in London...

To threaten a cop with
a gun is a serious offence...

1461
01:32:30,845 --> 01:32:32,085
how did you manage to free him ?

1462
01:32:34,583 --> 01:32:37,189
How much help did you
get from the Indian embassy ?

1463
01:32:37,319 --> 01:32:39,856
Will you now do a
"No Drinking" campaign ?

1464
01:32:40,055 --> 01:32:41,033
What has happened has happened...

1465

1467
01:32:43,125 --> 01:32:45,401

1474
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:14,430

01:33:20,562 --> 01:33:22,599

Are you in your senses ?

Rascal

1507
01:34:42,877 --> 01:34:43,412
Sicko

1508
01:34:43,478 --> 01:34:44,456

1509
01:34:44,512 --> 01:34:45,422

and you have the guts
to be ashamed of me !

How dare you be ashamed of me ?

1522
01:35:03,031 --> 01:35:06,103
Who the hell you think
you are to be ashamed of me?

1523
01:35:06,234 --> 01:35:07,269
Who?

01:35:08,503 --> 01:35:10,312
You think by writing me a cheque....

1525
01:35:10,371 --> 01:35:11,441
you have the right
to be ashamed of me ?

1526
01:35:11,506 --> 01:35:13,042
Take your job

1527
01:35:13,575 --> 01:35:14,553

go drink water

1531
01:35:26,454 --> 01:35:29,298

that I am...

1533
01:35:30,925 --> 01:35:32,370
not ashamed at all

1534
01:35:32,427 --> 01:35:35,067
What does he think of himself ?

1535
01:35:35,263 --> 01:35:38,506
Something's wrong...

1536
01:35:43,405 --> 01:35:45,009
not ashamed at all

1537
01:35:46,374 --> 01:35:47,853
not ashamed at all

1538
01:35:48,310 --> 01:35:49,414
Sir... it's out of sync!

1539
01:35:49,477 --> 01:35:51,388
His voice and lip
movement does not match

1540
01:35:51,446 --> 01:35:53,016
Must be some technical error

1541
01:35:53,148 --> 01:35:55,424
No... no...
everything else is in sync...

1542
01:35:55,850 --> 01:35:57,261
something is wrong !

1543
01:36:18,506 --> 01:36:20,486
You will play the role of a mute guy ?

1544
01:36:22,110 --> 01:36:23,453

SHHHHHQ( Silent love)

1545
01:36:25,046 --> 01:36:26,457
Title is not the problem

1546
01:36:28,216 --> 01:36:29,388
How will you manage ?

1547
01:36:30,919 --> 01:36:32,262
How will you speak to the director ?

1548
01:36:33,088 --> 01:36:34,590
How will you speak to the writer ?

1549
01:36:39,260 --> 01:36:40,068
Me?

1550
01:36:41,229 --> 01:36:43,402
You will speak for my film ?

1551
01:36:44,899 --> 01:36:45,673
What do I do ?

1552
01:36:46,067 --> 01:36:47,273
How do I make my film ?

1553
01:36:48,570 --> 01:36:49,514
Should I forget it ?

1554
01:36:51,673 --> 01:36:52,413
What ?

1555
01:36:54,375 --> 01:36:55,080
No way...

1556
01:36:55,143 --> 01:36:57,089
Why should I make
a film with your idea ?

1557
01:36:57,145 --> 01:37:00,319
I don't like all this
manipulative handicapped mush !

1558
01:37:05,587 --> 01:37:07,498
You think that drunkard
Will come back...

1559
01:37:08,289 --> 01:37:10,428
when he hears about the new film ?

1560
01:37:12,994 --> 01:37:14,337
That means I'm screwed...

1561
01:37:16,698 --> 01:37:17,938
Wow !

1562
01:37:19,033 --> 01:37:20,535
Best of luck to me man !

1563
01:37:28,209 --> 01:37:29,244
In the monkey world...

1564
01:37:29,310 --> 01:37:31,051
is there a shortage
of female monkeys ?

1565
01:37:32,413 --> 01:37:34,415
Why... bad times is it?

1566
01:37:34,616 --> 01:37:37,597
Didn't find a sexy actress ?
So hitting on a director now ?

1567
01:37:37,652 --> 01:37:41,156
So that she forgets her
own dream and chases yours ?

1568
01:37:43,091 --> 01:37:44,968
Kiss my arse monkey!

1569
01:37:52,467 --> 01:37:55,505
Love story of 2 mute people ?

1570
01:37:57,005 --> 01:38:00,350
Both can't speak ?

1571
01:38:01,142 --> 01:38:05,557
In Koshish (film)...
But that's different

1572
01:38:05,647 --> 01:38:07,058
And in Barfi (film)?

1573
01:38:07,148 --> 01:38:09,150
No never been clone before

1574
01:38:09,217 --> 01:38:10,287
Fantastic idea !

1575
01:38:10,352 --> 01:38:12,127
I want to meet him now

1576
01:38:12,220 --> 01:38:15,326
Sir he doesn't want to speak

1577
01:38:15,590 --> 01:38:17,695
He is learning the sign language

1578
01:38:17,959 --> 01:38:20,166
He wants to experience...

1579
01:38:20,361 --> 01:38:22,602
The silence inside

1580
01:38:24,299 --> 01:38:26,506
We need to plan... please speak

1581
01:38:30,939 --> 01:38:33,943
He won't speak until
The film is complete

1582
01:38:37,612 --> 01:38:38,955
You won't speak ?

1583
01:38:40,248 --> 01:38:41,591
Till the end ?

1584
01:38:42,483 --> 01:38:43,154
Take a bet...

1585
01:38:43,484 --> 01:38:44,155
first shot...

1586
01:38:44,919 --> 01:38:45,454
after the first shot...

1587
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:46,590
if you don't come and say...

1588
01:38:46,654 --> 01:38:48,292
that you have an idea...

1589
01:38:48,923 --> 01:38:50,231
I will stop making films

1590
01:38:50,291 --> 01:38:52,931
I will stop making..

1591
01:38:53,261 --> 01:38:56,401
..films.

1592
01:38:59,267 --> 01:39:00,940
Actor is dumb...

1593
01:39:01,536 --> 01:39:03,072
Actress is dumb...

1594
01:39:03,471 --> 01:39:05,041
Director is also dumb

1595
01:39:05,373 --> 01:39:06,443
Perfect team

1596
01:39:12,614 --> 01:39:15,925
Hot hot fritters

1597
01:39:25,193 --> 01:39:26,433
What?

1598
01:39:32,567 --> 01:39:34,410
Sir.

1599
01:39:34,969 --> 01:39:35,913
What is happening 7

1600
01:39:36,270 --> 01:39:38,614
How can the mobile
work without the sim card ?

1601
01:39:48,983 --> 01:39:54,456
Keep my table reserved

1602
01:39:55,323 --> 01:39:58,065
I want to make a
film with Shamitabh...

1603
01:39:58,259 --> 01:40:00,136
but success has gone to his head

1604
01:40:00,194 --> 01:40:02,265
Dad...Sp...sp...speak to Ranbir

1605
01:40:02,464 --> 01:40:05,377
Get me a s...s...s...s...
sweet lime ju ju juice...

1606
01:40:05,467 --> 01:40:07,310
But what will the poor producer do?

1607
01:40:07,468 --> 01:40:10,039
There are just a few
big stars in the industry

1608
01:40:10,572 --> 01:40:12,552
Why do you need to search elsewhere ?

1609
01:40:14,375 --> 01:40:17,447
A big star is right here...
drinking sweet lime juice!

1610
01:40:18,213 --> 01:40:20,955
Love is so worthless".

1611
01:40:21,115 --> 01:40:22,458
Love is so worthless".

1612
01:40:25,219 --> 01:40:27,699
Love is so worthless a th...
th... th... thing

1613
01:40:27,922 --> 01:40:29,299
Love is so wo.. wo.. wo...

1614
01:40:29,424 --> 01:40:30,402
Cut this wo... wo... wo...

1615
01:40:30,892 --> 01:40:32,530
close up... close up...

1616
01:40:33,161 --> 01:40:34,196
Cut..cut..now join it together

1617
01:40:34,429 --> 01:40:36,204
Love is so worthless".

1618
01:40:36,264 --> 01:40:40,212
No matter how much time you give it

1619
01:40:40,635 --> 01:40:42,478
Totally sounds like Shamitabh !

1620
01:40:42,537 --> 01:40:44,278
Sounds even a lot more powerful...

1621
01:40:44,472 --> 01:40:47,385
it will rock with my son's personality

1622
01:40:49,043 --> 01:40:50,545
Sounds a lot like Shamitabh...

1623
01:40:51,179 --> 01:40:52,214
but the bass is stronger

1624
01:40:52,313 --> 01:40:54,554
Silence please.

1625
01:40:55,884 --> 01:40:56,954
Cut seven.

1626
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:07,135
Speak man !

1627
01:41:08,129 --> 01:41:09,107
Take 2.

1628
01:41:09,263 --> 01:41:12,403
What your m..m..m..mother
didn't give you in childhood

1629
01:41:12,467 --> 01:41:14,469
What your mother didn't
give you in childhood

1630
01:41:14,535 --> 01:41:18,483
What your girlfriend
didn't give you in adulthood

1631
01:41:24,211 --> 01:41:25,918
What is the problem ?

1632
01:41:27,648 --> 01:41:28,888
Too classy ?

1633
01:41:29,383 --> 01:41:30,384
Not massy ?

1634
01:41:31,552 --> 01:41:33,896
But the subject is like that...

1635
01:41:34,121 --> 01:41:34,929
Pure!

1636
01:41:34,989 --> 01:41:39,961
In this kind of a film you
can't have a Bollywood dance number

1637
01:41:41,029 --> 01:41:41,598
What ?

1638
01:42:02,550 --> 01:42:05,622
Stereophonic silence...

1639
01:42:08,489 --> 01:42:11,959
Dolby digital silence...

1640
01:42:14,395 --> 01:42:17,342
Stereophonic silence...

1641
01:42:17,565 --> 01:42:20,375
Dolby digital silence...

1642
01:42:20,534 --> 01:42:23,344
Listen to the sound of silence

1643
01:42:23,404 --> 01:42:25,975
Silence.

1644
01:42:26,107 --> 01:42:28,849
Come on, let's do the silence.

1645
01:42:29,043 --> 01:42:31,887
Silence.

1646
01:42:32,013 --> 01:42:34,857
Come on, let's do the silence.

1647
01:42:35,082 --> 01:42:36,186
If you want to save the country...

1648
01:42:36,217 --> 01:42:37,696
stop talking, raise your hand...

1649
01:42:37,852 --> 01:42:39,559
and SLAP !

1650
01:42:41,456 --> 01:42:44,232
This trailor should
play in all theatres

1651
01:42:44,359 --> 01:42:46,566
If you give away all the
thunder before the release...

1652
01:42:46,627 --> 01:42:47,901
what will you show in the film ?

1653
01:42:47,962 --> 01:42:48,599
What do you mean ?

1654
01:42:49,030 --> 01:42:52,307
Your son's voice is the
biggest thunder in the film !

1655
01:42:52,901 --> 01:42:54,209
Why give it for free !

1656
01:42:54,269 --> 01:42:55,179
Save it...

1657
01:42:56,070 --> 01:42:58,175
for the friday in the theatre...

1658
01:42:58,940 --> 01:43:01,113
there will be applause
everyday and later !

1659
01:43:02,377 --> 01:43:03,287
Release a song

1660
01:43:03,578 --> 01:43:06,718
The SLAP song

1661
01:43:09,317 --> 01:43:10,159
A slap.

1662
01:43:10,217 --> 01:43:13,391
Like this.

1663
01:43:13,521 --> 01:43:16,900
Like this.

1664
01:43:16,924 --> 01:43:20,064
A slap.

1665
01:43:20,194 --> 01:43:23,641
This film must be
promoted with dignity

1666
01:43:23,898 --> 01:43:26,037
I want a full page article daily...

1667
01:43:26,167 --> 01:43:27,612
"WATCH OUT FOR ARMAAN"

1668
01:43:27,668 --> 01:43:29,170
No stupid promotions...

1669
01:43:29,237 --> 01:43:30,614
no cookery show for Shamitabh...

1670
01:43:30,872 --> 01:43:32,874
I have heard great things
about Shamitabh's film...

1671
01:43:32,907 --> 01:43:34,386
don't release your
film on the same date

1672
01:43:36,210 --> 01:43:37,086
NO!

1673
01:43:37,478 --> 01:43:39,185
It will release on December
4th whatever happens

1674
01:43:39,246 --> 01:43:42,125
We heard that you won't
speak till the Dec 4th release

1675
01:43:43,951 --> 01:43:46,329
This film's subject is sensitive...

1676
01:43:46,387 --> 01:43:48,094
Sign language interview?

1677
01:43:48,489 --> 01:43:52,904
Media can create a rift
between a man's face and his voice

1678
01:43:53,895 --> 01:43:56,341
A bus conductor hailing
from a village near lgatpuri

1679
01:43:56,397 --> 01:43:58,570
He used to be so quiet...
I really thought he was mute

1680
01:44:15,883 --> 01:44:17,362
Controversial superstar...

1681
01:44:17,418 --> 01:44:19,295
Shamitabh's new film... ISHHHHHQ

1682
01:44:19,353 --> 01:44:23,062
releases worldwide
today in 3500 screens !

1683
01:44:23,891 --> 01:44:27,134
Producer Keshav Bhimani's
new film also releases today...

1684
01:44:27,195 --> 01:44:28,367
'THAPPAD' (SLAP)

1685
01:44:29,030 --> 01:44:30,566
Will it be slapped by ISHHHHHQ ?

1686
01:44:30,831 --> 01:44:32,868
or will it slap ISHHHHHQ
at the box office ?

1687
01:44:47,915 --> 01:44:50,088
Sir, what do you say
after this controversy?

1688
01:44:50,151 --> 01:44:52,324
Please, tell us, sir.

1689
01:44:52,487 --> 01:44:54,626
The biggest problem
of the nation is....

1690
01:44:55,123 --> 01:44:56,124
not population...

1691
01:44:56,557 --> 01:44:57,900
not corruption...

1692
01:44:58,292 --> 01:44:59,430
not poverty...

1693
01:45:00,094 --> 01:45:02,199
The biggest problem
of this nation is...

1694
01:45:02,330 --> 01:45:03,331
idle talk!

1695
01:45:08,269 --> 01:45:09,873
How did you like the film '
shhhhq' ?

1696
01:45:09,937 --> 01:45:12,213
It's a classy film...but
not as good as Lifebuoy

1697
01:45:12,273 --> 01:45:13,877
Did you like ‘Thappad’ ?

1698
01:45:14,108 --> 01:45:16,520
Heavy voice on dead
body is scary picture

1699
01:45:16,610 --> 01:45:20,581
Shamitabh is good! But without
a voice...not the same Shamitabh !

1700
01:45:20,948 --> 01:45:23,588
You can't copy Shamitabh's
voice and become Shamitabh...

1701
01:45:23,651 --> 01:45:25,221
total time waste

1702
01:45:25,286 --> 01:45:27,425
Shamitabh's voice?

1703
01:45:27,488 --> 01:45:29,126
Two tickets for Thappad !

1704
01:46:18,105 --> 01:46:20,210
That drunkard is also a flop...

1705
01:46:20,975 --> 01:46:22,318
he'll come back...

1706
01:46:23,878 --> 01:46:25,414
if you call him!

1707
01:46:33,554 --> 01:46:35,056
Cut the bloody crap...

1708
01:46:35,890 --> 01:46:38,427
When was the last time
you thought about anybody else ?

1709
01:46:39,160 --> 01:46:40,138
Take a break

1710
01:46:40,227 --> 01:46:42,969
Take a damn break
from being so selfish

1711
01:46:43,230 --> 01:46:45,267
Aren't you tired of taking help ?

1712
01:46:46,300 --> 01:46:48,041
Stop thinking about yourself!

1713
01:46:48,135 --> 01:46:49,546
I have helped you make 3 films...

1714
01:46:49,637 --> 01:46:51,548
help me make one film dammit!

1715
01:46:51,606 --> 01:46:53,643
Think of my film... think about me...

1716
01:46:53,907 --> 01:46:55,944
do something for me... for once!

1717
01:47:02,350 --> 01:47:03,021
Hello

1718
01:47:03,184 --> 01:47:03,685
Madam...

1719
01:47:04,485 --> 01:47:06,192
his phone has only two numbers...

1720
01:47:06,554 --> 01:47:09,228
Your number and Shamitabh's number...

1721
01:47:09,490 --> 01:47:13,097
he has been drinking
heavily for 3 clays...

1722
01:47:13,394 --> 01:47:15,533
for the first time I am
afraid to be in the graveyard

1723
01:47:16,130 --> 01:47:17,438
If something happens to him...

1724
01:47:17,965 --> 01:47:19,467
with these hands I have to...

1725
01:47:23,437 --> 01:47:24,347
Bring some water

1726
01:47:37,918 --> 01:47:39,488
Make him drink a bottle of water

1727
01:47:51,933 --> 01:47:52,934
This is water, right?

1728
01:47:53,033 --> 01:47:53,909
Yes

1729
01:47:56,537 --> 01:47:57,948
Get up

1730
01:48:03,444 --> 01:48:04,946
No water...

1731
01:48:05,379 --> 01:48:06,357
Whisky!

1732
01:48:07,047 --> 01:48:08,117
Whisky!

1733
01:48:08,649 --> 01:48:12,028
Whisky doesn't need any water

1734
01:48:12,086 --> 01:48:13,292
That man is 'water'...

1735
01:48:13,521 --> 01:48:14,556
this man is ‘whisky’...

1736
01:48:15,189 --> 01:48:16,463
he does not like water...

1737
01:48:17,091 --> 01:48:20,095
he has a big philosophy

1738
01:48:23,397 --> 01:48:24,637
You idiot

1739
01:48:24,699 --> 01:48:25,973
look here

1740
01:48:26,166 --> 01:48:27,611
look at this...

1741
01:48:27,668 --> 01:48:32,640
This is 43% alcohol...
and 57% is water!

1742
01:48:33,006 --> 01:48:34,144
Whisky is made from water

1743
01:48:34,242 --> 01:48:36,051
there can be no whisky without water!

1744
01:48:36,310 --> 01:48:38,312
Before writing a book on 'Egos'...

1745
01:48:38,379 --> 01:48:40,552
you should have read the label first

1746
01:49:18,018 --> 01:49:23,627
Beggars should never
leave empty handed

1747
01:49:29,330 --> 01:49:30,240
Come here

1748
01:49:30,431 --> 01:49:31,535
come on get up

1749
01:49:42,409 --> 01:49:49,190
I don't need any help to get up

1750
01:50:00,661 --> 01:50:01,935
Speak

1751
01:50:03,530 --> 01:50:05,271
speak UP"-

1752
01:50:06,200 --> 01:50:09,909
oh I forgot...

1753
01:50:10,671 --> 01:50:13,174
you can't speak !

1754
01:50:13,941 --> 01:50:14,976
What ?

1755
01:50:17,611 --> 01:50:18,316
What ?

1756
01:50:20,948 --> 01:50:24,361
Haven't you fallen ?

1757
01:50:26,087 --> 01:50:28,624
Before I arrived, what were you?

1758
01:50:30,924 --> 01:50:32,062
What were you ?

1759
01:50:33,127 --> 01:50:34,470
Zero

1760
01:50:38,131 --> 01:50:39,542
Before me zero...

1761
01:50:40,434 --> 01:50:41,970
After me zero

1762
01:50:42,936 --> 01:50:44,438
only in between...

1763
01:50:45,072 --> 01:50:46,050
Hero

1764
01:50:47,041 --> 01:50:48,452
Because...

1765
01:50:48,509 --> 01:50:50,284
behind the zero...

1766
01:50:50,978 --> 01:50:53,015
there was a hero !

1767
01:50:53,080 --> 01:50:54,150
Hero !

1768
01:50:55,449 --> 01:50:57,929
Stop ! Stop !

1769
01:51:04,224 --> 01:51:06,932
Stop.

1770
01:51:07,061 --> 01:51:10,508
Enough ! Enough ! Enough!

1771
01:51:12,099 --> 01:51:14,136
How old are you both ?

1772
01:51:14,902 --> 01:51:16,313
Together 97 years !

1773
01:51:16,370 --> 01:51:19,977
You should have 97
Years of common sense

1774
01:51:21,976 --> 01:51:23,148
Idiots

1775
01:51:23,443 --> 01:51:26,151
Even Nursery kids have more sense

1776
01:51:29,850 --> 01:51:32,023
Come on! Move your fat bloody arses !

1777
01:51:32,920 --> 01:51:34,866
Move it you brainless pigs !

1778
01:51:39,493 --> 01:51:42,906
Move it...or I'll bash
and bury you guys right here!

1779
01:51:44,465 --> 01:51:45,876
Come on ! Move it!

1780
01:51:49,536 --> 01:51:53,484
Hey... stop stop...
Where are you going ?

1781
01:51:55,943 --> 01:51:57,889
Oh ! Shamitabh sir... hello

Sit down

1784
01:52:03,484 --> 01:52:04,986
I said sit down !

1785
01:52:10,658 --> 01:52:15,107
Now kids,
we will learn the A B C D of life!

1786
01:52:16,463 --> 01:52:17,305
If you don't pay attention...

1787
01:52:17,364 --> 01:52:19,935

you'll get a lashing

1788
01:52:21,935 --> 01:52:23,414
'A' for Alone

1789
01:52:23,470 --> 01:52:25,472
No one can live alone

1790
01:52:26,140 --> 01:52:27,551
'B' for Big

1791
01:52:27,608 --> 01:52:29,610
To be big, you have to be together

1792
01:52:30,911 --> 01:52:31,912
'C' for...

1793
01:52:32,513 --> 01:52:34,254
Both of you know very well...

1794
01:52:34,314 --> 01:52:36,954
'C' is one who thinks
he can make it big alone

1795
01:52:37,551 --> 01:52:39,189
'D' for Distance

1796
01:52:39,253 --> 01:52:41,893
A guy who thinks he can make
it big alone will not go the distance

1797
01:52:42,623 --> 01:52:44,466
<i>'E' for Ego</i>

1804

<i>'J' for Joke</i>

1805
01:52:57,271 --> 01:53:00,013

Will the film also
be black or have color ?

1813
01:53:52,559 --> 01:53:53,970
Approved ?

1814
01:53:56,997 --> 01:53:58,635
Perfect title...

1815

Sorry here's your refund...

1818

This is Shamitabh's house, right?

1822
01:54:17,885 --> 01:54:19,922
Just a minute.-

1828
01:54:39,340 --> 01:54:40,318

1829
01:54:40,874 --> 01:54:41,545
and...

1830
01:54:42,343 --> 01:54:43,549
I'm your actor

1831
01:54:47,014 --> 01:54:47,890

1832
01:54:48,248 --> 01:54:49,056

I find you too attractive

1836
01:54:53,987 --> 01:54:54,965
I want to grab you
kiss you

1837
01:54:55,022 --> 01:54:56,592
rip your clothes off
and make love to you right here

1838
01:54:58,525 --> 01:55:00,596
I want to be the father of your child

1839
01:55:07,034 --> 01:55:09,014
You are in the wrong industry...

1840
01:55:10,304 --> 01:55:11,510
here, on the casting couch...

1841
01:55:11,571 --> 01:55:14,142
actors have to sleep with directors

1842
01:55:15,509 --> 01:55:17,386
not the other way around

1843
01:55:19,579 --> 01:55:21,388
If I rip your clothes off monkey...

1844
01:55:21,582 --> 01:55:23,255
what will I get to see ?

1845
01:55:23,550 --> 01:55:24,654
Your tail ?

1846
01:55:32,025 --> 01:55:33,936
I like you too...

1847
01:55:57,250 --> 01:56:00,322
Hello Daanish... hello Amitabh

1848
01:56:01,588 --> 01:56:04,501
I KNOW !

1849
01:56:06,961 --> 01:56:07,996
Rajeev...

1850
01:56:09,529 --> 01:56:12,009
a small journalist

1851
01:56:18,372 --> 01:56:22,320
What if he comes to the
film launch and exposes the truth?

1852
01:56:30,250 --> 01:56:32,252
I want to tell the world the truth

1853
01:56:32,352 --> 01:56:33,353
What ?

1854
01:56:35,089 --> 01:56:37,968
I am sorry...Pandey...
am I missing something here?

1855
01:56:39,059 --> 01:56:40,470
Akshara's film is starting...

1856
01:56:41,161 --> 01:56:42,640
And you want to tell the truth ?

1857
01:56:43,063 --> 01:56:44,371
Very bad idea

1858
01:56:44,431 --> 01:56:47,571
Truth is the world's
most powerful idea

1859
01:56:48,235 --> 01:56:49,145
When you speak the truth...

1860
01:56:49,203 --> 01:56:50,409
the people who want to expose it...

1861
01:56:50,471 --> 01:56:51,677
will have nothing to say

1862
01:56:52,573 --> 01:56:53,574
Yes I am mute

1863
01:56:53,640 --> 01:56:55,415
This is my voice
This is a technology...

1864
01:56:55,475 --> 01:56:56,954
that brings me and
my voice together...

1865
01:56:57,010 --> 01:56:57,681
Done !

1866
01:56:58,045 --> 01:56:59,524
Who can do anything after that!

1867
01:57:00,347 --> 01:57:01,087
So...

1868
01:57:01,915 --> 01:57:02,586
No. 1

1869
01:57:03,984 --> 01:57:06,487
Speak the truth and fear vanishes

1870
01:57:06,953 --> 01:57:07,590
No. 2

1871
01:57:08,389 --> 01:57:10,665
Speaking the truth
increases shock value

1872
01:57:10,958 --> 01:57:12,562
Shamitabh is mute!

1873
01:57:12,659 --> 01:57:15,640
Superstar Shamitabh is mute!!!

1874
01:57:19,599 --> 01:57:20,407
No. 3

1875
01:57:21,068 --> 01:57:24,948
When you speak the truth...
emotions flow

1876
01:57:29,343 --> 01:57:31,414
A mute guy"-

1877
01:57:31,478 --> 01:57:33,014
with his dedication...

1878
01:57:33,080 --> 01:57:34,457
with his passion...

1879
01:57:35,048 --> 01:57:37,050
has overcome his handicap...

1880
01:57:37,617 --> 01:57:39,392
and conquered the world

1881
01:57:40,220 --> 01:57:41,597
What a story !

1882
01:57:41,655 --> 01:57:44,397
No.4... there is a
small additional advantage

1883
01:57:44,958 --> 01:57:47,063
All the mute people will
know about this technology...

1884
01:57:47,127 --> 01:57:49,300
many drunkards will
happily lend their voices...

1885
01:57:49,363 --> 01:57:52,936
After all, the brand ambassador
of this technology is Shamitabh !

1886
01:57:53,166 --> 01:57:55,442
Small advantage...
but still an advantage

1887
01:57:55,502 --> 01:57:56,947
No. 5

1888
01:57:58,104 --> 01:58:01,449
The biggest benefit
of speaking the truth...

1889
01:58:02,976 --> 01:58:05,252
Box office collection !

1890
01:58:09,149 --> 01:58:12,323
A tsunami of emotions
will fill the theatre

1891
01:58:12,952 --> 01:58:17,128
Wide eyed, they will watch
the superstar's perfomance

1892
01:58:17,591 --> 01:58:22,631
Ears will throb with
the superstar's dialogues

1893
01:58:23,229 --> 01:58:27,678
Hearts will be filled with
touching music for this mute

1894
01:58:27,934 --> 01:58:30,437
they will cry as they whistle

1895
01:58:30,937 --> 01:58:33,918
The world's first superstar...

1896
01:58:34,307 --> 01:58:36,253
who is actually mute !

1897
01:58:37,177 --> 01:58:38,554
Opening weekend...

1898
01:58:38,912 --> 01:58:41,119
$25 million dollars !

1899
01:58:41,915 --> 01:58:47,126
Truth is the world's
most powerful idea !

1900
01:58:54,461 --> 01:58:56,168
What a speech !

1901
01:59:08,208 --> 01:59:11,087
Sha Sha

1902
01:59:11,945 --> 01:59:13,288
Sha Sha

1903
01:59:13,680 --> 01:59:17,628
mi mi... ta.. ta.. What a star.

1904
01:59:17,984 --> 01:59:21,625
Go, everywhere,
where you receive appreciation.

1905
01:59:21,955 --> 01:59:25,266
The style doesn't appear.

1906
01:59:25,492 --> 01:59:29,099
This morning doesn't arrive daily.

1907
01:59:29,429 --> 01:59:33,241
You have achieved fame.

1908
01:59:38,872 --> 01:59:41,113
Once the truth is out,
I won't be able to drink freely

1909
01:59:41,908 --> 01:59:43,615
You are going to make me famous

1910
01:59:45,011 --> 01:59:46,319
You are a very clever guy

1911
01:59:47,147 --> 01:59:49,252
When a superstar wears
such a bad shirt....

1912
01:59:49,316 --> 01:59:50,294
and goes to a launch...

1913
01:59:50,350 --> 01:59:52,455
All the focus will be on the shirt

1914
01:59:53,120 --> 01:59:57,569
I will have to explain the
exciting history of this shirt

1915
01:59:58,325 --> 02:00:00,168
Shirt is your weapon...

1916
02:00:00,226 --> 02:00:02,570
to steal the attention from me

1917
02:00:22,515 --> 02:00:24,188
Wish I was mute too...

1918
02:00:25,952 --> 02:00:27,989
when a normal person becomes big...

1919
02:00:28,054 --> 02:00:29,032
he becomes big

1920
02:00:29,489 --> 02:00:32,493
But when a handicapped
person becomes big...

1921
02:00:33,059 --> 02:00:34,595
he becomes a legend !

1922
02:00:35,362 --> 02:00:36,534
In this world...

1923
02:00:36,596 --> 02:00:38,906
no handicap is a bigger handicap

1924
02:00:39,566 --> 02:00:41,170
What I mean to say is...

1925
02:00:42,235 --> 02:00:44,272
by speaking the truth, as usual...

1926
02:00:44,337 --> 02:00:46,408
you will benefit more than me

1927
02:01:08,628 --> 02:01:10,471
Love message from my sister-in-law ?

1928
02:01:11,365 --> 02:01:13,606
She could have easily
come along with us... but no!

1929
02:01:14,001 --> 02:01:16,675
If they don't go hours earlier...
To check the arrangements...

1930
02:01:16,937 --> 02:01:20,384
how will women be at peace !

1931
02:01:22,342 --> 02:01:23,377
Sister-in-law ?

1932
02:01:26,179 --> 02:01:27,351
Sister-in-law ? Sister-in-law ?

1933
02:01:28,482 --> 02:01:29,324
Why ?

1934
02:01:29,449 --> 02:01:30,985
Sister-in-law... Sister-in-law...

1935
02:01:31,084 --> 02:01:31,619
Sister-in-law ?

1936
02:01:32,285 --> 02:01:33,320
No sister-in-law ?

1937
02:01:34,454 --> 02:01:35,432
Sister-in-law. sister-in-law

1938
02:01:35,889 --> 02:01:36,424
Sister-in-law ?

1939
02:01:36,523 --> 02:01:39,060
Sister-in-law O Sister-in-law

1940
02:01:39,559 --> 02:01:43,632
Sister-in-law O Sister-in-law

1941
02:01:43,931 --> 02:01:45,911
Sister-in-law O Sister-in-law

1942
02:01:47,100 --> 02:01:48,602
So jealous of my voice ?

1943
02:01:50,537 --> 02:01:52,881
Sister-in-law O Sister-in-law

1944
02:01:52,972 --> 02:01:54,918
Sister-in-law O Sister-in-law

1945
02:01:55,608 --> 02:01:58,987
Sister-in-law O Sister-in-law

1946
02:04:20,253 --> 02:04:22,563
He has bilateral
traumatic pneumothorax...

1947
02:04:22,622 --> 02:04:23,623
his lung injury seems quite bad

1948
02:04:23,890 --> 02:04:25,494
Fortunately we could
tracheotomized him in time.

1949
02:04:25,659 --> 02:04:27,639
his larynx is shattered...

1950
02:04:27,894 --> 02:04:29,840
may be very difficult
to restore his speech...

1951
02:04:29,863 --> 02:04:31,865
The reconstruction of the larynx..

1952
02:04:45,178 --> 02:04:50,127
You will be finished without my voice

1953
02:06:29,649 --> 02:06:31,390
lfl am finished...

1954
02:06:31,451 --> 02:06:34,455
your voice will also be finished

1955
02:07:08,955 --> 02:07:11,094
Can't we sit somewhere else ?

1956
02:07:11,291 --> 02:07:12,565
Why ? What's the problem here ?

1957
02:07:13,493 --> 02:07:16,440
It's someone's grave

1958
02:07:16,529 --> 02:07:18,372
it's not correct

1959
02:07:19,966 --> 02:07:20,967
It's empty

1960
02:07:21,201 --> 02:07:22,475
reserved for me !

1961
02:07:47,660 --> 02:07:49,037
Shamitabh...

1962
02:07:49,629 --> 02:07:51,939
lam Shamitabh too!

1963
02:09:07,574 --> 02:09:09,076
Film is love...

1964
02:09:09,509 --> 02:09:11,182
Film is passion...

1965
02:09:11,411 --> 02:09:13,118
Film is pain...

1966
02:09:13,479 --> 02:09:15,049
Film is the cure...

1967
02:09:15,581 --> 02:09:17,026
Film is a blessing...

1968
02:09:18,651 --> 02:09:20,392
Salute film...

1969
02:09:20,453 --> 02:09:22,364
Salute film...

1970
02:09:22,455 --> 02:09:23,957
Salute film
