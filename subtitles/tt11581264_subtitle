It was late by six months

Let's leave from here
and talk on the way

27
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,500
Brother, shall we go straight away
to your hometown?

28
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,780
No, sir

29
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,660
I don't know how many people
will believe me in my hometown?

30
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,540
There are few things to be done

31
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,740
I'll set foot in my village
once it's over

32
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,100
Okay, brother
Then, we can go to my hometown

33
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,180
Okay, sir

34
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,380
There won't be any problem here

35
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,740
You can stay here as
long as you want

36
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:19,060
Dr Kokila mam told you
to talk to her when you come out

37
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,060
She wants to talk something
about Draupathi mam

38
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,820
- Will you speak now?
- Not now, sir

39
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,220
Don't let anyone know
that I'm out of prison

40
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,340
I have to go to Chennai
for Draupathi case

41
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,860
I'll speak to her after coming back

42
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,500

00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,660
- Then, you've to do one more help
- Tell me

44
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,620
For Draupathi, Lakshmi and Uncle
I didn't do the rituals after they died

45
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,660
If you help, I can do it now

46
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,140
Let me arrange it
You just relax

47
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,260

00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,300
- Excuse me
- Yes, mam

49
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,460
Rania mam asked me to come
Will you convey her that I've come?

50
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,580
Mam, Gaythri mam is waiting
for you at reception

51
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,420
- Oh, has she arrived?
- Yes, she has come

52
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,500
Okay, two minutes break

53
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,220
Hi!

54
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,020
How are you, Gayu?

55
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,260
Yeah, I'm good
How are you?

56
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,020
I'm fine

57
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,700
You told me to come
Is there any film shoot?

58
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,660
We are going to film shoot a documentary

59
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,860
So, you should accompany us to
the village for ten days to act in it

60
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,100
Sure, what's the concept?

61
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,940
I'm going to shoot a documentary based
on real life story called 'Draupathi's vow'

62
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,220
A doctor is the producer

63
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,980
That content will be shocking
and controversial

64
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,060
Excellent!

65
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,820
I'm ready to act
When are we leaving?

66
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,940
- Greetings, swamy!
- Greetings!

67
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,580
Swamy, didn't I say earlier?
That's for him

68
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,020
Tell me

69
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,140
Six months ago three people of
my family died in an accident

70
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,060
I was not in hometown then
I've just arrived

71
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,060
Should I do obsequies
or give alms on death anniversary?

72
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,620
No matter how many months
you need to do the obsequies

73
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,620
and later give alms to the dead

74
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,060
It is then the rituals and customs
will materialize

75
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,180
Then, let's do obsequies

76
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,380
Okay, good
Tell me your race and lineage

77
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,900
Jambu Maharishi lineage

78
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,260
As per your customs
shave your moustache

79
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,580
and beard and take head-bath

80
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,660
Let's do it well

81
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,500
If so, I've an important
work than this

82
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,820
I'll finish it and come

83
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,860
Only then, their soul will attain peace

84
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,300
- I'll leave, Swamy
- Okay

85
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,420
- Sir!
- Tell me, brother

86
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:21,260
I'm leaving to my hometown, tomorrow
We can do it a month later, sir

87
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:46,940
- Greetings, mam!
- Greetings!

88
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,420
I'm Shankar
I'm working as an associate director

89
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,460
The doctor told me to help you with the
documentary that you're going to do

90
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,060
- Thank you, Shankar
- It's okay, mam

91
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:58,300
I'm doing a documentary on the incident
that happened in this Villupuram district

92
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,540
I'll send you some photos of
reference characters through WhatsApp

93
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:05,900
I want people like them
It'll be helpful if you find them out

94
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,380
Okay, mam
You go and take rest

95
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,540
I'll arrange the actors you need
and meet you tomorrow

96
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,180
Raja!

97
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,460
Hey, dude!

98
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,700
How are you?

99
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,300
- How about all?
- They are good

100
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,980
Why is this beard?

101
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,460
Are you coming here straight away
from out of bail?

102
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,580
Didn't you go to hometown?

103
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:46,300
Dude, don't you know about Draupathi?
She has told me one thing

104
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,620
If I had not fulfill that vow
her soul will not attain peace

105
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,460
So, I've lied to everyone and
came to Chennai in search of you

106
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,140
If you've any problem
I'll just leave

107
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,580
Hey, dude!
Why are you talking like this?

108
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,860
Come on

109
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,740
Like the one that happened
to sister Draupathi

110
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,300
It shouldn't happen to anyone

111
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,140
What to do?

112
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,980
You stay here
I'll do whatever you need

113
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,180
I won't tell the guys
that you are here

114
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,460
- Okay?
- Okay, dude

115
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,340
Dude, have water when you feel thirsty

116
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:21,060
Lot of mosquitoes here
Cover yourself

117
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,460
Will you sleep now?

118
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,900
I'm not feeling sleepy
You go and sleep

119
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,580
Dude, are you in memories of Draupathi?

120
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,060
It'll be disheartening

121
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,700
What the people say
isn't wrong, dude

122
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,100
I have killed Draupathi

123
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,180
I shouldn't have left her alone
on that day

124
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,140
I made a big mistake

125
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:47,980
The guys have told me everything
Don't get perplexed, unnecessarily

126
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:48,580
Sleep now

127
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:53,700
Atlast, I wasn't gifted enough to
see her and do the final rites

128
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,220
I feel disheartening, dude

129
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,740
Okay, dude

130
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,860
Sleep now
Sleep peacefully

131
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,540
Whatever, let's talk in the morning
Okay?

132
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:12,140
- Dude, I need a small help
- What's that?

133
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,660
Take me to this address

134
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,420
- Who is he?
- I'll tell you later

135
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,500
- First, take me to this address
- Okay, dude

136
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,020
Just wait for five minutes
I'll get ready and come

137
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,060
- Dude, shall we go?
- Yeah, let's go

138
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:46,500
Granny, give me five hundred rupees
Where is your purse?

139
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:49,020
Go away, has he given me money?
Ask your dad

140
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,340
Look for the vehicle

141
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,060
Brother, which is the house with No.234?

142
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,820
No.234?
It's not here

143
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,820
Only 55 houses are here
Go the other side and check

144
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,820
It's not here

145
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,340
Have you seen the guy
in this photo?

146
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,380
- No, I haven't seen him
- Is it?

147
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,300
No

148
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:17,260
Dude, they have given a fake address

149
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,700
They ought to come to the court

150
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,980
Won't they be caught, then?
Let's see

151
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,300
Dude!

152
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,180
Didn't I tell you to inquire
about the guy on phone?

153
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:25,740
Yeah

154
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,860
Don't do it, now
They might get doubt

155
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,340
Okay

156
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,620
Then, one important thing
I need a SIM card now

157
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,220
Why?

158
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,100
My old SIM will not be the right one
for the job I'm going to do now

159
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,140
And nobody should know
that I have a phone

160
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:36,940
Okay, dude

161
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,580
And we are just friends for those
who work under you

162
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,260
Okay, dude

163
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,460
They shouldn't know
any of my problems

164
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,660
- Jack!
- Hi, brother!

165
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,820
Dude, didn't I tell you?

166
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,740
- He is Jackdoss
- Greetings, boss

167
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,540
He is expert in women's issues

168
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,060
Don't praise me high, brother

169
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,260
Why are you so early?

170
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,500
I'm going to have candy
in the evening

171
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,260
So, I need to finish the work
and leave

172
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,340
You mean, candy?

173
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,060
You ask him?

174
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,020
Candy, means?

175
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:08,260
Candy, it's candy
A stick candy for the babes

176
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,620
Who is he?
Looking handsome

177
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,740
He is my friend
going to work here

178
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,460
Dude, that is the registrar
office, Royapuram

179
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,540
Lakshmi's marriage was registered here

180
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,140
For those who elope from the town

181
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:28,180
Built this for them to get married

182
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,180
Let us not talk here
We will go to the tea shop

183
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,460
- brother, two cups of ginger tea
- Okay

184
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,820
You've seen the registrar office, right?

185
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,940
Do you know, how many cheating
marriages has happened there?

186
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,180
They have ruined the name of Madras

187
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,380
When we get married to a woman
and live with disciplined relationship

188
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,060
Do you know what people
say about them?

189
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,820
Hapless!

190
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,820
I'll be furious at that time

191
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,500
Hey, what have you done
with your hand?

192
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,620
Look, the blood is oozing

193
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,660
Oh, no!
why are you doing like this?

194
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,580
Look here

195
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,140
Tell me whatever it is

196
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,580
Who is he?

197
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,340
Let's go

198
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,660
Who is he?

199
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,900
Is he involved in Draupathi case?
Shall we kill him?

200
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,220
- Tell me, dude
- Let's go

201
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:28,980
Come

202
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,700
Hey!
Hey, what are you doing?

203
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,020
In the tea shop, you broke the glass
and hurt your hand

204
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,060
Now, punching the wall here

205
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,100
You'd have thrashed him
when he was caught

206
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,700
The problem is not to kill him
Draupathi must win her vow

207
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,460
Are you not going to kill him?

208
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,140
Hey! To kill Draupathi he planned and
made you to come to the bus stop

209
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,020
You say, you just want them to leave

210
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,940
Listen dude, we must kill them
I believe you've come for it

211
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,220
What's your decision now?

212
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,180
What do you want now?
Tell me that

213
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,100
I need a tea shop, now
A bicycle and a tea can

214
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,100
That's all, right?
I have my bicycle

215
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,500
The seat is not good
I'll get it welded

216
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,140
I'll buy the tea can, tomorrow morning

217
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,940
Is it okay?
Okay?

218
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,900
Come on

219
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,500
Punching on the wall!
Go

220
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:43,300
"Utter as, 'mom'!
Ask that God!"

221
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,740
Greetings, brother

222
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,740
Welcome, Raja
Why are you here, suddenly?

223
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,820
The bicycle seat isn't good
I came to get it ready

224
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,060
Let me do

225
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,380
Who is he looking dull
with bandage in hands?

226
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,020
He is my brother-in-law
He has come from my hometown

227
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,460
My sister died six months ago

228
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,980
So, I've brought him here
to stay with me for few days

229
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,740
We didn't bring anything at birth

230
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,700
We don't carry anything
when we leave this world

231
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,460
With the lines of 'Poet Pattinathar'
let's get rid of his sadness

232
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,020
Bang the drums!

233
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,420
"We play hide and seek game
with eyes opened"

234
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:22,540
"Many flower gardens
are sleeping beneath the soil"

235
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,980
"We play hide and seek game
with eyes opened"

236
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:34,340
"Many flower gardens
are sleeping beneath the soil"

237
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:39,140
"This human life doesn't exist
without birth and death"

238
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,380
"There is no life"

239
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:46,820
"The sweet memories are
the limit of our life"

240
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,980
"Our limit "

241
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,860
"She didn't go anywhere, dude!"

242
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:56,780
"She's living in your heart
building a castle"

243
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:00,660
"She didn't go anywhere, dude!"

244
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,780
"She's living as god
in your heart"

245
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,300
"We play hide and seek game
with eyes opened"

246
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:12,860
"Many flower gardens
are sleeping beneath the soil"

247
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:33,620
"Dear my dear"

248
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:43,100
"The man and the woman, "
"With love and pleasure,"

249
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,940
"Filled with emotions,"

250
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,980
"We were born in
a drop of semen"

251
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,580
"Creeping as a child,"

252
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,820
"We grew up on many laps,"

253
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:54,700
"We adored the Tamil language
and passed our days of youth"

254
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,180
"The courtly male, and
The majestic warrior,"

255
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,500
"The robust dear,"

256
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:02,580
"The children and the properties
Along with the desires,"

257
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,140
"The wealth varies
and the youth transforms,"

258
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,620
"The golden age advances, dear"

259
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:13,820
"The meaning of life
is then understood,"

260
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:17,700
"It'll happen to you
and the same will happen to me"

261
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:21,580
"What's seen by eyes will blend
with the sea breeze"

262
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:25,100
"We play hide and seek game
with eyes opened"

263
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:29,660
"Many flower gardens
are sleeping beneath the soil"

264
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:36,660
"We play hide and seek game
with eyes opened"

265
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:41,140
"Many flower gardens
are sleeping beneath the soil"

266
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:45,860
"This human life doesn't exist
without birth and death"

267
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,860
"There is no life"

268
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:53,580
"The sweet memories are
the limit of our life"

269
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,740
"Our limit "

270
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:59,500
"She didn't go anywhere, dude!"

271
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:03,500
"She's living in your heart
building a castle"

272
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:07,340
"She didn't go anywhere, dude!"

273
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:11,460
"She's living as god
in your heart"

274
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:15,060
"We play hide and seek game
with eyes opened"

275
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:19,700
"Many flower gardens
are sleeping beneath the soil"

276
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,100
Cut

277
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,340
Great, master!

278
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,740
- You got perfect artistes
- Thank you, mam

279
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,420
- Shall I ask Gayathri mam to come?
- Yes, Tell her to Come

280
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,980
Rania, look at the footage
It's good!

281
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,980
Gayathri, you look so nice

282
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:52,620
- you almost look like Draupathi
- Thank you, Rania

283
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:57,820
Actually, once I wear these attires
I feel brave and pride

284
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,420
What are we going to do, now?

285
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:02,860
He is the martial arts master
casting as Draupathi's husband Prabhakaran

286
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,260
Now, the scene is

287
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,380
He will teach you the martial arts
and you're acting like learning it

288
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,940
Okay, ready
Let's go

289
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:09,940
Action!

290
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,860
Cut
Nice

291
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,100
- Shall we shift to the next location?
- Okay, let's go

292
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,220
Dude, is the tea can ready?

293
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,380
Is that one?
I have brought it

294
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,140
I'll go and bring it now

295
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,380
Jack, take rest for five minutes

296
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,500
Okay
Come

297
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,380
I'll be back

298
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,180
- Jack!
- Tell me, boss

299
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:39,340
Why can't you get married
to a girl who works hard like you?

300
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,780
Instead, you're going in search
of rich women

301
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,900
and why do you think
you should live on that money?

302
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:45,740
Did he tell about me?
He is enraged on me, boss

303
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,980
We are kept suppressed
Who let us to grow?

304
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,380
Tell me
I'm not educated

305
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,900
By polishing the shoes
or cutting the plates

306
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,780
I can no longer settle in life

307
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,700
- We too need to grow up, right?
- Not being educated is your fault

308
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,740
Doesn't your conscience tell
what you're doing is wrong?

309
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,820
It's not at all wrong

310
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:08,020
Our life will be great when
we get married to ***

311
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,260
- Isn't it right?
- Yeah, right

312
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,500
Look, you're surprised on my speech

313
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:15,100
If you heed the speech of
our ***, you will be astonished

314
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,540
Better, tell me

315
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,980
Okay, you've taken up a decision
I'll try my best to settle you

316
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,580
Prabha, come here

317
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,780
Dude, I've arranged
the bicycle as you asked

318
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,780
Is this enough, dude

319
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,500
Yes, enough

320
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,820
They have poisoned
the minds of guys like Jack

321
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,140
A big revolution must be
made to change things right

322
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:49,100
Okay, what are you going
to do with this?

323
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,860
Brother, a tea costs Rs7

324
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,820
- Will you have it?
- Give me two cups of tea

325
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,100
Look after the shop
I'll have tea and come

326
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,060
Okay, brother

327
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,020
Is it Rs.7?

328
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:45,740
Brother, please come every day
Outside the gate, Kumar has a tea shop

329
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:49,060
He gives hot water as tea
I feel sleepy when having that

330
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,460
Come everyday

331
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,100
Someone has opened a new tea shop

332
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,020
Brother, tea

333
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,940
Hey, is this tea?
Just hot water

334
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,500
If you want tea, both you
and your owner have in that shop

335
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,780
I'll pay for it
Leave now

336
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,940
Brother, what's this?

337
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,500
Babu, chase him away

338
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,900
Hey, go away

339
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,060
Go

340
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,180
Brother, you have to leave
this shop in ten minutes

341
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,060
I have a shop here, right?
Don't ruin my life

342
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,420
Just for few days

343
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,620
After that, I'll go back
to my hometown

344
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,420
Adjust a little

345
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:30,620
You will serve good tea for them
Then, people here will question me

346
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,860
You leave from here, first

Dude, remove your hat

00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:09,740
Dude, you're the martial arts master

- What's this, sir?
- Go away

00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:20,940
Go

358
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,660
Have you got the bail?

359
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,620
I'm happy

360
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:27,140
Whatever problem you've,

361
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,020
My name is Maanikam

362
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,220
I'm leaving, dude

363
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,420
Brother, it's good

364
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,500
Though he is rude,
he is supporting you

365
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,540
You set up the shop
next to mine

366
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,380
I'll introduce you to all
Come on

367
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:47,780
"Heal, oh heart do heal,
the command of almighty are six"

368
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:49,780
Periyasamy, brother!

369
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,020
Just a minute

371
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,260
Brother, hereafter don't buy tea
from Kumar's shop

372
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,860
Buy from his shop
The tea is good

373
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,020
Is it?
Okay, come on

374
00:22:59,060 --> 00:22:59,900

He is our guy

377
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,900
How long has it been
I visited our hometown last?

When I come to take photocopy,
I'll take you to all and introduce

382
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:12,860
- Is it okay?
- Okay

383
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:13,740
Brother

384
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,900
Brother, you're arranging
the wedding for everyone

385
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:21,380
- Can you help me?
- You haven't sold three bags yet

386
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:26,300
The day you sell ten bags,
I'll arrange your wedding Okay?

387
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,020
Don't tease me, brother

388
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,780
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready, brother

389
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,420
- Hey, I'll hit you
- Don't..

390
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,140
Give him a tea

391
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,460
Nowadays, everything has become online

392
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,380
Check the Government website
You will know the full details

393
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,420
Sir, he belongs to my hometown

394
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,660
He has a tea shop
in our premises

395
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,900
The tea is good

396
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,460
Give him a tea

397
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,780
Enough

398
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,780
Twenty seven, twenty nine, two

399
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,340
It's good

400
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,340
- Mani
- Sir!

401
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:03,860
Tell this guy to give tea everyday
for the those who work at our office

402
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,300
Okay, sir

403
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,620
- What's your name?
- Prabhakaran

404
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,660
Prabhakaran, excellent!
The tea is good

405
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,260
Thank you, sir

406
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,260
Carry on

407
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,140
The one who is hiding
behind the tree

408
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,180
Shoot him

409
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,020
Brother, is there any room
to change the clothes?

410
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,940
If you want to change clothes
in aeration, it's Rs50

411
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:22,900
If you need a room,
the charges will be Rs200

412
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,180
Then, a room is okay

413
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,060
Hey, take her to the back

414
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,580
Please, be quiet

415
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,860
I'm going to kill you
Give me

416
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,020
Put the phone down
Take them

417
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,180
Then, you play It

418
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,380
Come, sister

419
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,300
Bhai, who are they?

420
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:40,220
You're new to this area, right?
Just wait for ten minutes

421
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,340
Brother, ready

422
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,300
- Did your parents come with you?
- No, brother

423
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,420
Oh, no! This registrar is very strict

424
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,860
He won't do the registration
unless your parents come

425
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,500
The advocate will take care of
all those

426
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,420
Who is the advocate?

427
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,940
- He is the advocate
- She is my client

428
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,940
- Is it you?
- Greetings

429
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,780
It seems you will not let anyone
without taking commission

430
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:00,580
Come on

431
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,180
My income has gone

432
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,820
How come these girls
are so brave?

433
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,780
She came wearing a nighty

434
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:11,300
drape the silk saree here
and get married

435
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:14,820
Brother, most of the weddings here
happen in the filmy style, 'Alaipayuthey'

436
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:18,140
The boys are scared
but not these girls

437
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,740
How to do the registration?
How much does it cost?

438
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,780
Will you take care
without knowing to anyone?

439
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,620
They will ask such
different queries

440
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,020
After two days,
being caught at home,

441
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,020
She will come here weeping
and say, I've unknowingly signed

442
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,060
My father is important to me

443
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,460
It would be humourous

444
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,620
You're going to be here, right
You will see many such dramas

445
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,740
It's enough, if we get the money

446
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,180
Have it, sir

447
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,700
No need money
Go

448
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:54,340
Brother, will you get profit
when you sell a cup of tea for Rs7?

449
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:58,140
When you get Rs500 income,
we can pay the rent and eat in Chennai

450
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:00,980
Looks like you haven't
come here to earn

451
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,700
When the elderly come,
you give them tea for free

452
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,820
What are you upto?

453
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,460
I don't have anyone
That's why

454
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,060
It's heartbreaking
when looking at them

455
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,780
Good deeds aren't
appreciated nowadays

456
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,900
I'm not selling only the bags
to feed my family

457
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,140
I'm earning through
middleman job

458
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:19,020
People elope and come here
to get married

459
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:22,380
If we talk to them pleasingly
and send to Karuna brother,

460
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,740
I'll get Rs500 commission

461
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,620
Okay, Bhai

462
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:27,460
Will Karuna brother
come here often?

463
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,660
Inform me when he comes
next time

464
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,380
- have to meet him
- Okay, brother

465
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,380
Karuna brother has come

466
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,940
- Greetings, brother!
- Greetings, Bhai

467
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,900
- Didn't any of the guys come here?
- No

468
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,180
- Have tea, brother
- No need, Bhai

469
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:12,220
He seems to be familiar
Where do you belong?

470
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,460
- I'm from old washermanpet
- is it?

471
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:18,060
Bhai, tomorrow guys will come for
the registration from Chengalpattu

472
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,940
Take care of them safely
I'll come at 11 o'clock

473
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,500
Okay

474
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,860
Call me after they are come here

475
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:36,220
Dude, we have seen you
living sophisticated

476
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,980
But, you're suffering here

477
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,700
Is fulfilling a vow a simple thing?

478
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:46,380
Today I met and spoke to Karuna
He have decided his death day

479
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:49,300
Excellent, dude
Plan well and kill him

480
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,820
Hey, when are you going
to take me?

481
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:53,940
- Be quiet
- You keep saying this

482
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:56,100
- Who is Salim Bhai here?
- It's me

483
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,780
- Are you coming from Chengalpattu?
- Yes

484
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,100
Karuna brother had told me

485
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,020
He said he will come by 11 o'clock
Wait till then

486
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,260
Okay, please take care of her
I'll go out and be back

487
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,860
- Wait here, we will be back
- Okay

488
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,500
Bhai, who are they?

489
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,340
Brother, take care of her
for ten minutes

490
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,980
- I'll go to washroom
- Okay, Go

491
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,060
Dear, you seem to be very young
Don't you think it's wrong?

492
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,620
- Are you studying?
- Final year in college

493
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,380
- Where do you belong?
- Chengalpattu

494
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,220
After the guy finish his studies
and take up a job

495
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,500
you can talk in home, isn't it?

496
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,780
Why do you hurry?

497
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:43,260
I was caught when speaking
to him on phone

498
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:47,620
He belongs to other caste
Anyhow, my parents will not accept

499
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,900
My father says he will die
if I get married to this guy

500
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,420
This guy says if I doesn't marry him,
he will die

501
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,140
- That's why
- So, is It Okay if your father dies?

502
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:00,940
When thinking who is important,
my father has lived his life and old too

503
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,260
I like Mari the most

504
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,860
He is pityful
He is a good guy

505
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:09,020
- Prabha, come here
- Not that

506
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,700
- Come here
- What happened, sir?

507
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,460
You shouldn't talk all these here

508
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,340
It's not the place
to show our feelings

509
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:20,100
If advocate Karuna know this,
he will kill you

510
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:25,300
Don't care all these
You look after your job, Prabha

511
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,780
I can understand, sir

512
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,700
I gave you a document

513
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,900
Sir, it's over

514
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,780
- Everything is over
- Hey, hold It

515
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:39,300
The wedding has happened well
Be a father soon

516
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,700
- Dude, a selfie
- Take me too

517
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,300
- Was everything good?
- Yes, good

518
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,340
Where will the newlywed stay?

519
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:46,060
Our friend's house is at Red hills
We are planning their stay there

520
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,820
The girl's house is riotous
They are searching for her

521
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,580
That's why, we are thinking
to arrange their stay far away

522
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,820
What he says is right

523
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:54,100
For three days,
I'll take care of their stay

524
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,300
That will be safe
than the place you say

525
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,860
- That's right
- Let them enjoy for a week

526
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:00,580
Later, we will go with a team
of five advocates and settle it

527
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,900
- Okay, brother
- You all can leave

528
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,500
The certificate will get ready
by 5 o'clock in the evening

529
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,060
Okay, brother

530
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,300
You sign and get it

531
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,820
Bhai!

532
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,140
- What brother?
- What's this?

533
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,940
He says he can get
the marriage certificate in a day

534
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,180
Brother, don't you know?

535
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,700
If given bribe, the marriage certificate
will be issued in an hour

536
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:19,900
They place advertisement in Google
for marriages and earn money

537
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,940
Marriages like this happens
for every two days, isn't it?

538
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,460
- Bhai, come here
- Yes, brother

539
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,020
Everything was good

540
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,860
Next week, another couple will arrive
Let's meet then

541
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,980
- I'm leaving, Bhai
- Okay, brother

542
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:36,980
Welcome

543
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,220
Bhai, I have a small work
I'll be back soon

544
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,220
Okay, brother

545
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,980
'Tasmac'

546
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,300
- Hey, will you booze?
- Yes

547
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,540
Hey, Brother
Come here

548
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:52,380
Tell me, brother

549
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,620
One beer,

550
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,820
One brandy, Half vodka
and get the dishes

551
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,900
Okay, brother

552
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,140
Don't be tensed
Have it

553
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:27,500
Dude, I'm in the wine shop
at Vysarpadi junction

554
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:30,100
Karuna is here
Bring a rod when coming

555
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,740
I'll be there in ten minutes, dude

556
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,980
It's said the issue is riotous
in the girl's house

557
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:39,540
How about her background?

558
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,300
Twenty acres of wet land

559
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:44,180
Five acres of flower garden
Five acres of betel plantation

560
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:47,660
The land tenancy will be
20 lakhs per annum

561
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,860
Her father would always scold her

562
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:52,540
Using that, I had been talking
to her for two months and seduced her

563
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,540
Dude, take this

564
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,580
Where is he, dude?

565
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,900
He is boozing inside

566
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,700
I think, he will come out
in few minutes

567
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,660
Let's wait

568
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:06,300
Brother, you're like the god

569
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:10,340
You helped me to get married
and brought me to the wine shop also

570
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,780
It's enough if few good people
like you live in this country

571
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,140
Instead of studying and struggling
to find a job...

572
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:18,060
boys like me
can live as a rich groom

573
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,420
Hey, not only for you

574
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,700
Tell the guys whoever in need
I'll take care

575
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:33,700
It's enough, you've uttered a word,
you're the mentor to all our guys

576
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:40,860
(Phone ringtone)

577
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,500
- Brother, tell me
- Come to the wine shop

578
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,940
- I'm busy in work
- I told you to Come

579
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,180
Okay, I'm coming

580
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:52,980
Tell me, brother

581
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,060
A goat has been trapped

582
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,580
Hold him
Let's go to the room

583
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,700
Okay, brother

584
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,260
Hey, bring him carefully

585
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,660
If these people won't fall in love,
I wouldn't survive

586
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,140
Dude, they have come

587
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,620
Hey, hold him

588
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,820
Make him to sit

589
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,340
Hey!

590
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,100
You can leave, Kumar

591
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,020
I'll call you if in need

592
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,060
Okay, brother

593
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,780
Have you come?
How long to wait?

594
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,980
Mari
Brother you

595
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,140
Nothing

596
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,580
What happen to Mari?

597
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,820
Be careful

598
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,460
He has gone there

599
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,300
In happiness,
he has exceeded the limit

600
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,980
Will Mari drink?

601
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,860
What?
He will booze heavily

602
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:20,020
Only today I know
that he will booze

603
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:26,780
It's not like I thought
The issue is furious on your side

604
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,460
- So, just for five minutes
- Five minutes?

605
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:32,100
Hey, I'm not a kind of person
like you think

606
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,780
I have *** for that

607
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,940
I will take a nude video of you

608
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,660
Brother, why are you talking like this?

609
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,460
I have to speak to your father
showing that

610
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,820
I have come with trust on him

611
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,500
Please, leave me brother

612
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:49,340
Don't shoot the video, brother
My father will die if he see it

613
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,300
He'd have died the moment
you eloped with him

614
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,460
Please, brother
Please, leave me

615
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:56,580
- Hey, take off your clothes
- Please, brother

616
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,220
He is asking to take off her clothes

617
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,500
What are you saying, dude?
Shall we kill him inside?

618
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,660
Just be patient

619
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,060
Don't you do what I'm say, right?

620
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,860
No, brother
Please

621
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,140
I'll kill him and you too

622
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:10,460
and say to the media that
your father and maternal uncle did it

623
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,300
No, brother

624
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,260
My father and Mari,
both are pityful

625
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:13,860
Hey!

626
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,180
- Don't do anything, please brother
- Take off the clothes

627
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,780
Please, brother
Leave him

628
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,700
- I'll slit his throat
- Don't do, brother

629
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,780
I'll take off my clothes

630
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,740
Good girl
Remove it

631
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,340
I'll take it
Leave him

632
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,700
Do something

633
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:36,820
Damn it, these people
were irritating at this time

634
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:42,220
If you try to run away
with this as a reason...

635
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,140
he will lie dead on the railway track
in the morning

636
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,060
Stay here

637
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:17,460
- Are you Rudra Prabhakar?
- Yes

638
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:16,100
Hey, leave me
I did by mistake

639
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,780
Prabhakar, forgive me

640
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,660
Leave me

641
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,220
Gayu, watch this video

642
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,260
What video?

643
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:36,940
'In Vysarpadi, Chennai, Karuna an advocate
has been murdered in a public place'

644
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,500
'by some mysterious people'

645
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:41,060
'This has caused furore in that area'

646
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:45,380
'The police department has
registered FIR and doing investigation'

647
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,780
Who is this advocate?
Known to you?

648
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,980
We are casting an advocate
in our documentary, isn't it?

649
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:50,500
Yes

650
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,220
He is the real character of it

651
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,140
Oh!

652
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:55,780
He must have done some problem
elsewhere, like he did to Draupathi

653
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,500
That's why, they have killed him

654
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:00,140
It's okay if he does anarchy
to some extent

655
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:03,180
This will be the end when he
takes up anarchy as full time job

656
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,900
Mam, the shot is ready

657
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,940
You carry on

658
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:10,540
I'll create a blog about
this advocate and tweet

659
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,380
Let's go

660
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:22,100
- Brother, Just a minute
- Tell me, dude

661
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,900
- What happened?
- Don't know

662
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:26,860
Last night, he was inebriated
It seems some ruckus has arisen

663
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:30,140
Someone has banged him
on the head

664
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,940
The skull was broken
and he died on the spot it seems

665
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,980
Brother, the corpse

666
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,940
Sir, the autopsy is over
Go and get the corpse

667
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,460
- I'm coming
- Okay sir

668
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,020
Oh! Karuna

669
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:09,860
Is this the age to die?
You're lying like this?

670
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,620
But one thing, I'll not leave those
who killed you, whoever it is

671
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,060
Whoever it is

672
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:29,700
- Bhai, why have you become dull?
- No, brother

673
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:33,060
I feel disturbed from seeing
his body in the morgue

674
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:36,660
I feel afraid when thinking of
doing this middleman job

675
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,900
You know it's wrong
Then, you should leave it

676
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:40,780
No, brother

677
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,180
I never said this
to anyone so far

678
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:45,620
Three years ago, when I fell down,
I got wounded in an eye

679
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:48,380
Since then, my eye seems blurry

680
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:52,020
Since, I need money to rectify it,
I've been doing this middleman job

681
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,100
Don't worry, Bhai

682
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,460
You will get a solution
for everything

683
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,860
Until then, keep away
from doing this business

684
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:57,660
Okay, brother

685
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,220
Today is my wife's death anniversary

686
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:02,420
I told to get food for you too

687
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,780
My daughter has brought food
Come, let's eat

688
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,540
You go

689
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:08,700
I went to morgue,
so I'll take bath and go to prayer

690
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:09,700
Okay, Bhai

691
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:15,740
My dear go the mummy

692
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:18,940
Sir!

693
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,060
Are they your daughter
and grand daughter?

694
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,300
Yes, my granddaughter
is one and half years old

695
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,540
But, when I think of my daughter

696
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:27,300
Sir!

697
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,540
You go and be at the office

698
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,460
I'll take care of her
until I'm alive

699
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,780
Then?

700
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:38,420
Worried how they both
will survive?

701
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:39,980
Why, sir?

702
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:40,820
Isn't your son- in- law there
to take care?

703
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,260
Is he a son- in- law?

704
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,860
He is a misery who came
to destroy my family

705
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:49,700
Because of this ruined love,
my daughter is one among the spoiled girls

706
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:53,100
Without seeing caste and creed,
she decided her life

707
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,700
on her own, when studying

708
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:58,220
Being a parent,
I gave her 25 sovereigns of gold

709
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:03,820
That traitor impregnated her
and eloped with the gold

710
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,940
It's all fate

711
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:16,060
Each and every day, when these girls
elope and get their marriage registered,

712
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,820
my belly will burn
thinking of the parents

713
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:24,860
If I open up my mouth,
I will starve

714
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:29,780
- Sir, can you do me a help?
- I'll do

715
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:32,820
Whatever, I'll do for your sake

716
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:44,780
Sir, this is a complicated case
We know who is the accused

717
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:47,700
If you just utter a word,
we will imprison him and thump

718
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:48,660
- Try to finish it soon
- Okay, sir

719
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,220
Welcome Arun!
Be seated

720
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,060
- Hi, sir!
- Hello, sir!

721
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,940
- Just wait, I'll call
- Okay, sir

722
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:59,140
Tell me, sir
You called me as an emergency

723
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,580
Watch this video, Arun

724
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:19,660
Who is he?

725
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,260
He has masqueraded with colours
and did this murder

726
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,140
Who is this victim?

727
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:24,220
Advocate Karuna, who was murdered
two days ago

728
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,860
- Have you heard it?
- Yes, sir

729
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,020
It's him

730
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:29,660
Someone has killed him,
took the video

731
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,780
and sent through
redanillo email id

732
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,540
He has sent only to me, secretly

733
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:35,060
That's why, I asked you to come

734
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,700
Sir, is there any other details
regarding this case?

735
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,900
He has sent a message
along with this video

736
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:41,380
The women in your limits were taken
granted as business

737
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:43,260
by some advocates
where you didn't warn them

738
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:44,820
That's why, I did this murder

739
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:47,220
Henceforth, if you don't take action
against such criminals,

740
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:49,940
these murders will continue
He has warned me, Arun

741
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,460
Now, they've given work to you

742
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,780
Do you've other details
about advocate Karuna?

743
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,780
I'll tell the locale Police inspector
to give the other details

744
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:56,460
You get from him

745
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:59,100
Another important thing,
he has sent this video only to me

746
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,780
He didn't send to
any other higher official

747
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:02,300
If the press and social media
is aware of it,

748
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:03,700
they will link me in this issue

749
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:05,700
So, do the inquiry in non- uniform

750
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:07,100
And let it be
just between both of us

751
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:09,580
I'll discuss with the cyber crime
and report to you, sir

752
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:19,220
- How are you?
- I'm good

753
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,860
- You've put on weight
- Yes, sir

754
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,140
Since joining the cyber crime department,
my job is confined to the room

755
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,500
It has been mentioned as special inquiry
Is it such a big case?

756
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:28,180
The deceased was an advocate
Someone had murdered him in public

757
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:29,620
And the accused has sent
a video on email

758
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:32,020
We have to search the video
in reverse process and if we get

759
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:34,340
the IP address of the video,
then we will nab the accused

760
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:34,940
Okay, sir

761
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:37,380
I'll tell my team to inquire
and ask to give the report

762
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:40,060
- Greetings, sir!
- Welcome, sir

763
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:41,460
Greetings, sir
Be seated

764
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:43,340
Sir, take it

765
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:44,460
Thank you

766
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,740
Sir, any information from your side
Any CCTV footage?

767
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:49,180
Or is there any witness in that area?

768
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:53,700
Sir, that's a dead end
There is no CCTV camera as you expect

769
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:54,940
In my point of view,

770
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,980
Someone who was victimised
has taken revenge

771
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,060
Revenge!

772
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,100
I can't understand
Tell me, clearly

773
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:01,940
The deceased was not an advocate

774
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:02,460
Oh!

775
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:05,420
He got a fake certificate as LLB
And he was just a middleman

776
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:08,940
Even on the day of murder,
he threatened a newlywed girl

777
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,820
and tried to take a nude video

778
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:13,780
As the electrical power went off,
that girl has escaped

779
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:17,020
I found that girl
and reunited with her parents

780
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:18,940
Someone who was affected
had done this

781
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:20,820
Why are you doing
inquiry for him?

782
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,420
Whether the deceased
is good or bad

783
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,220
it's our job to do inquiry
and submit a report

784
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:25,900
The court will take care
of the rest

785
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:31,340
Jack, there is a girl in
my hometown like you seek

786
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:33,180
- She will be beautiful
- It's okay

787
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:34,780
She lives with her father

788
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:36,620
He is very innocent

789
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,700
He has property
worth of five crores

790
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:40,500
- Wow, superb!
- Only daughter

791
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:42,900
Really?
Do you have her photo?

792
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:49,460
Wow! She looks awesome
Am I getting married with her?

793
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:50,940
The girl's name is Lakshmi

794
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:54,060
Without the presence of the girl,

795
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:55,900
it's my responsibility
to get the certificate of register marriage

796
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:57,980
Is it possible to get married
without the bride?

797
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:01,540
By showing it, we can threaten
and force them to accept

798
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:02,260
It's excellent!

799
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:04,980
When you go as bridegroom,
you must give me twenty lakhs

800
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:05,540
Okay

801
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,220
If you agree this deal,
your wedding will be in two days

802
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:11,580
You're taking this risk for my sake
I'll sign wherever you want

803
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:14,380
Give me your photo and ration card

804
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:15,900
- I'll take care of the rest
- Done

805
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:18,300
Tell me, Arun

806
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:20,940
Sir, the mail id sent to you
was logged in from Canada

807
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:21,700
Is it?

808
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:24,620
As it was mailed from Canada,
we have to move this case officially

809
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:27,420
- Only then, we will get a clue
- You proceed the inquiry

810
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:31,500
In case, if he sends the video officially,
let's also take the next step, officially

811
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:32,820
- Okay, Arun?
- Okay, sir

812
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,300
Stop here

813
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:42,740
Is this the spot
where the murder occurred?

814
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:43,860
Yes, sir

815
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:45,820
It seems to be an active place

816
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:46,580
Yes sir

817
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:48,100
How did he do this incident here?

818
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,580
Hey, there is a CCTV camera

819
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:52,060
Yes, sir

820
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,620
The inspector has written
the report that there is no CCTV camera

821
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:55,700
Yes, sir

822
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:58,420
It seems he had planned it
and told to do the murder

823
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:00,020
Do the police inspectors do like this?

824
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:01,140
They will do
Will you see?

825
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:02,700
I'll go and get the footage, sir

826
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:08,820
Brother!

827
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:11,220
Two days ago, an advocate was
murdered here, right?

828
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:11,980
Yes

829
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:15,900
- Who will he visit here?
- He will come here to enjoy

830
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:21,420
If you want further details,
Ask Kumar who is there

831
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:22,500
Kumar?

832
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:26,100
It seems, those who have
the name 'Kumar' will be an accused

833
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:28,140
Greetings, sir

834
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:31,060
- Is it cutting or shaving?
- Cutting

835
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:32,700
Be seated, sir

836
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:36,900
Are you the aide
for advocate Karuna?

837
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:41,420
Sir, I'm not an aide to him
He will come for trimming

838
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:43,900
Sir, keep the object there
Who are you, sir?

839
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:46,100
Will you tell only
if you know who am I?

840
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:47,060
Come here

841
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:51,100
Tell me

842
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:52,100
Sir!

843
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:54,260
Why did he coming here

844
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:56,420
Sir, I have collected the CCTV footage

845
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:57,260
Got it?

846
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:59,380
- Take a video of everything he says
- Okay, sir

847
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:00,740
Capturing

848
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:02,740
Why does advocate Karuna
come here?

849
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:05,420
- Is this his office?
- Sir, it's not his office

850
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:06,580
Then, why does he come here?

851
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:08,340
Guys who fall in love
and elope here,

852
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:09,980
He will get them married
and make them stay here

853
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:12,620
Then, he will take the bridegroom
and make him inebriated

854
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:17,340
Then, he will shoot
a nude video of the bride

855
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:20,260
He will show that video to
her parents and mint money

856
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:22,700
Even on that day,
he brought a couple

857
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:26,260
He took the bride to the wine shop,
made him inebriated and called me, sir

858
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:28,220
I brought that guy and left here

859
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:29,620
He asked me to leave, sir

860
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:31,060
I don't know what happened, later

861
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:34,100
So, this is what you do
with the eloping couples

862
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:36,700
Sir, he doesn't do for everyone

863
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:41,060
To my knowledge, he'd have taken
nude videos of some sixty to seventy girls

864
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:44,420
Sixty to seventy girls!

865
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,740
Who will be having
advocate Karuna's phone?

866
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:48,980
It'll be in the department rack, sir
I'll bring it

867
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:50,380
It'll be in the rack, right?

868
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:53,620
Hey brother is coming
Give the respect

869
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:56,740
Don't overdo

870
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:01,100
It's getting late,
brother has not yet arrived

871
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:03,580
Give me two cups of tea

872
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,900
Hey, brother's vehicle has arrived
Come on

873
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:15,380
Come brother

874
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:19,300
Greetings, brother!

875
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:20,980
- Greetings!
- Greetings!

876
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:22,900
Why are you doing it?

877
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:25,860
Click a photo

878
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:26,980
You go
Go

879
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:28,020
You

880
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:30,420
Take the photo well

881
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:31,940
It's okay, go

882
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:33,180
Enough go

883
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:34,660
It's getting late
Let's go, brother

884
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:37,700
Instead of me,
they are behaving elated

885
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:45,460
- Is this the shop?
- Yes

886
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:46,100
Come on

887
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:47,620
He is the owner of this shop

888
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:48,660
Let's cut it

889
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:50,460
- Shall we cut it?
- We will do

890
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:52,100
Excellent, dude

891
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:55,860
Congratulations!
You should come up well

892
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:58,020
- Everyone listen me
- Listen to him

893
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:01,060
You all know, it's been a week
since Karuna has died

894
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:04,460
That's why, we made the inaugural
of this store a simple function

895
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:07,140
Whenever I come to Chennai,
he will take care of me

896
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:09,260
I intensely feel his absence, today

897
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:12,580
If the one who murdered him
gets caught

898
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:15,100
I'll lynch him into pieces

899
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:17,700
How many kangaroo courts
have been solved by me and Karuna?

900
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:20,060
Do you know how many people
have survived because of us?

901
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:21,700
They have murdered him
just like that

902
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:23,580
The income from this store
is not important

903
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:28,380
Instead, gather the land issues,
money issues and issues of women

904
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:30,540
I'll solve all those
Now, I'm leaving to Tindivanam

905
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:34,820
Let's celebrate Karuna's 16th day
of remembrance, a grandeur

906
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:38,860
- Just a minute, Murthy
- I'm coming, brother

907
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:40,860
I need to piss, urgently

908
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:42,460
It's an open place
Very dirty

909
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:43,220
Come, let's go to my house

910
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:44,940
It's okay if it's open place
Is it new to me?

911
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:46,380
- I'll take care
- Okay, brother

912
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:49,540
Hey, why are you coming along?

913
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:52,020
- I'll go, stay back
- Just for safety

914
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:53,580
I have the stuff
I'll take care, you go

915
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:55,940
Okay, brother
He is brave

916
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:25,340
Hey, go away

917
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:26,740
Go that side

918
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:32,700
Hello!
Tell me, Ravi

919
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:33,740
Sekhar!

920
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:34,940
Just a minute

921
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:00,060
It's enough
Come on

922
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:04,420
Instead of slitting the throat,
we'd have chopped off there

923
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:15,220
They are planning to start
a cola company in our village

924
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:18,780
Let them plan whatever, dear
They can't do anything beyond us

925
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:19,420
Cut

926
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:20,260
Okay

927
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:22,020
Gayu, please come here

928
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:25,660
- Sir, you check the other dialogue
- Tell me, Rania

929
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:28,300
I feel something fishy is happening
around in this case

930
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:29,820
What happened?
Any problem?

931
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:31,060
Not a problem

932
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:34,980
The advocate character which
we shot back at 60's was murdered

933
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:38,980
Now, the politician was
murdered by someone

934
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:44,460
Then, if it happens back to back
in the case of Draupathi,

935
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:47,020
someone among her relatives
might have taken revenge, isn't it?

936
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:47,780
No way

937
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:51,380
Only her husband is alive
Now, he is in prison

938
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:54,900
Then, any antagonists related
to this case is still out, Rania?

939
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:57,380
Yes, they are
A registrar and a student

940
00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:00,740
I'm going to tweet this now
Do one thing

941
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:04,900
Go to Royapuram registrar office
and shoot taking like bytes

942
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:05,580
Okay

943
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:08,220
Tomorrow, I'll proceed the shoot
with some other team

944
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:09,580
and come to the office
and check the footage

945
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:10,900
Sure
I'll get ready

946
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:23,980
Ask him

947
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:25,780
- Who is Murthy here?
- He is inside

948
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:26,860
Tell him to come

949
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:31,940
I'm Murthy

950
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:33,900
- Who are you?
- The police

951
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:35,500
Answer our queries

952
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:38,100
- Did you invite Chengi Sekhar?
- Yes, sir

953
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:39,580
What's the enmity between
you and Chengi Sekhar?

954
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:40,100
Enemity?

955
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:43,740
- You've invited him and killed him
- Sir, What are you saying?

956
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:47,300
He is the top notch of our party
I'm just stepping up

957
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:50,180
To be precise,
I'm a cardboard knife

958
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:51,860
- Trust me, sir
- Why are you acting?

959
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:54,620
Someone has slit his throat
in daylight

960
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:57,860
And someone took a video of it
You called him and did the murder

961
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:59,420
Do you think you can
become a topnotch?

962
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:02,180
Sir, will you keep on talking
as if you are the police?

963
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:05,540
I swear, he is like my brother

964
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:06,780
You are acting too smart

965
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:08,180
- Give the phone
- Take it

966
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:11,180
Take it, sir

967
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:18,700
Noted it?

968
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:29,060
The same shirt

969
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:32,220
Who is the one selling tea
in this photo?

970
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:36,460
Sir, I have never seen him
in this area

971
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,820
Check whether his face is visible
in someone else's phone

972
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:41,260
- If so, inform the police station
- Okay, sir

973
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:45,820
- Sir, would you like to have tea?
- No

974
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:48,140
Sir, I want to ask you one thing

975
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:52,980
When brother was alive,
I told him

976
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:56,020
Our guy has fell in love
with a girl

977
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:58,780
We have to register it
He is not alive now

978
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:01,500
- You have to help me
- So what? I'll do

979
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:02,660
Will the girl come here?

980
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:05,740
She belongs to Villupuram
Her father is very strict

981
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:07,460
If we register the
marriage in her absence

982
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:09,100
and we go to her father
with the certificate,

983
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:10,500
he will accept as there is no other way

984
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:11,660
It'll cost one lakh rupees

985
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:13,380
First, you must pay me
seventy five thousand

986
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:15,780
Then, twenty five thousand
to the registrar

987
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:19,460
If you agree, I'll get ready with
the proof and document by tomorrow

988
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:21,380
It's enough
if you bring the money

989
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:23,540
Okay, sir
I'll arrange the money, then

990
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:25,460
- Let me leave, sir
- Okay

991
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:26,340
Leaving, mam

992
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:28,460
Good evening, sir

993
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:29,500
Come, Arun

994
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:30,980
Be seated

995
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:38,620
What's the status, Arun?

996
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:41,820
The press on one side and the Commissioner
on other side is pressurising me

997
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:43,740
Sir, we got an another
big case in this

998
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:46,340
The advocate Karuna had taken
nude videos of many girls

999
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:48,300
shown it to their parents
and grabbed the money

1000
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:49,980
Chengi Sekhar is the head
for all these atrocities

1001
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:53,740
So, someone who got affected
by them has taken revenge, I think

1002
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:56,380
Arun, I have seen still dirty cases

1003
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:59,740
In my service, I have seen politicians
who invested on women

1004
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:01,620
and earned three thousand crores

1005
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:05,540
Instead of motivational murder,
if it has happened on business enmity?

1006
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:07,220
Yeah, sir
You're right

1007
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:09,180
Do you have any details
about the accused?

1008
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:10,140
I have, sir

1009
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:13,180
Watch this, sir

1010
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:16,100
This is the CCTV footage
of the first murder

1011
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:17,380
There will be a tea can
on the bicycle

1012
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:18,220
Look at it

1013
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:25,660
Sir, this is the evidence
got in the second murder

1014
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:27,460
If we match the both

1015
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:29,500
the accused have done
the murder like by selling tea

1016
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:31,140
And one more clue, sir

1017
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,540
Rania, a reporter has tweeted
that the next murder victim

1018
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:34,940
is the registrar
and a student

1019
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:38,500
If we know how she guessed it,
we can easily find the accused

1020
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:43,220
Arun, keep this

1021
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:47,460
If this is a motivational murder
like you said

1022
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:49,220
find the accused and
sort out the reason

1023
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:50,420
Else, do encounter

1024
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:52,220
I'll take care whatever problem arises

1025
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:53,940
Try to close the case soon

1026
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:56,140
Okay, sir
Sure

1027
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:57,620
Thank you, sir

1028
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:01,580
Which place is this?

1029
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:03,900
These kind of jobs
need to be done, secretly

1030
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:06,460
Come and see,
you will understand

1031
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:10,140
- Have you arranged the money?
-Yes, I have

1032
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:12,660
Come on

1033
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:13,900
Have you arranged the money?

1034
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:14,740
Give me

1035
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:16,300
Take it

1036
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:19,180
Come

1037
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:24,540
Sit down

1038
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:29,060
What's the document about?
Is it about land or marriage?

1039
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:31,140
'Cheating marriage'
Prepare the proof

1040
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:32,900
Give the details

1041
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:34,100
The girl's name
The father's name

1042
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,900
Date of birth
Give the right details

1043
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:43,220
The girl's photo?

1044
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:57,860
Sir, is this an original certificate?

1045
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:01,580
Then, if you give the name
and address, will we do it immediately?

1046
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:03,580
This is the Government birth certificate

1047
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:05,100
It will not lie

1048
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:06,660
Oh!

1049
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:10,060
Brother, the girl has completed
eighteen years of age

1050
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:11,060
Let's proceed

1051
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:12,340
Do it

1052
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:15,540
Can the Aadhar card be taken
from the Government's website?

1053
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:17,420
Are you from the village?

1054
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,500
Aadhar card is not available
in the website

1055
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:21,220
But, if you bribe Rs500,

1056
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:24,060
The private people will give
the Aadhar details of the whole nation

1057
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:26,940
It's enough to get the voter ID
We will do it also

1058
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:27,980
Wait, brother

1059
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:42,220
Brother, everything is ready

1060
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:45,900
I'll bring the girl there at 10 o'clock
You bring the guy

1061
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:47,500
We will pay the money
at the registrar office

1062
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:48,780
at 4 o'clock in the evening

1063
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:50,660
I'll get you the certificate
You can leave

1064
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,180
- Is it okay?
- Okay, sir

1065
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,700
- I'm leaving, sir
- Okay

1066
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:57,740
Will you support the youngsters
who fall in love and do register marriage?

1067
00:57:57,820 --> 00:57:58,180
No

1068
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:00,060
I'll support those who get married
with their parents consent

1069
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:02,380
Many couples secretly
get register marriage

1070
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:03,980
Tell us your opinion on that

1071
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:09,500
Because of this secret marriages,
many people are benefited

1072
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:13,700
But, the family gets affected

1073
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:18,100
I too wish to get married
if I get a girl

1074
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:20,580
Stand there

1075
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:22,180
Stand there

1076
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:23,500
Are you together stand here

1077
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:24,740
You all come here

1078
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:27,300
- Who is the groom?
- It's me, sir

1079
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:32,140
- Are you the bride?
- Yes, sir

1080
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:33,620
Didn't you get anyone else?

1081
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:35,260
- How is your daughter?
- She is good

1082
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:37,900
Who all came along with the bride?
Okay, sit

1083
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:39,180
- Along with the bride?
- These two people

1084
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:40,460
Is he?
Okay, sit

1085
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:47,980
- Prabha, is this your arrangement?
- Check It, sir

1086
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:49,140
Yes, sir

1087
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:54,140
Sign here

1088
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:15,580
What's this, advocate?

1089
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:17,900
Prabhakar will give
when the certificate gets ready

1090
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:20,660
- Will you get by noon?
- It's ready, sir

1091
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:22,980
Then, you all can leave

1092
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:27,820
What do you think about people falling
in love and getting register marriage?

1093
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:30,220
Sir, we get income
only if it happens

1094
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:30,860
Okay

1095
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:32,460
- You?
- No idea

1096
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:35,380
- You tell us
- It's their own wish

1097
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:37,380
Okay, thank you so much

1098
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:42,220
- Prabha!
- Sir!

1099
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:44,100
Come here
Sir is calling you

1100
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:46,300
Tell me, sir

1101
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:48,780
I have recorded everything

1102
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:50,340
Keep it safe

1103
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:52,580
Come Prabha, sit down

1104
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:55,980
The register marriage is over

1105
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:57,820
It will take thirty days
to prepare this document

1106
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:00,780
I got it ready by five hours
Have you brought the money?

1107
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:03,140
Sir, the advocate told me
to give at 4 o'clock

1108
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:04,660
I have to go home
and get the money

1109
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:07,940
It's right My family has started
to Tirupati, all of a sudden

1110
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:09,860
I told my wife
that I'll join them at 5 o'clock

1111
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:11,980
You do one thing
Get the certificate after two days

1112
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:12,900
Oh, gosh!
No, sir

1113
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:14,620
I'll go home now, get your address
from the peon

1114
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:15,580
and give you the money
at home

1115
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:16,820
That's intelligence!
Do it

1116
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:24,460
Sir, got the message of
Rania's phone signal list

1117
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:25,180
Look at this

1118
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:26,180
Give it

1119
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:30,460
She was in Villupuram
for past ten days

1120
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:32,580
The two village towers are shown

1121
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:35,860
When the murder happened
in Chennai, she was in Villupuram

1122
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:38,100
Then, how did she tweet
about this case?

1123
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:40,780
Has she done for publicity?

1124
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:41,260
No, no

1125
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:42,420
She is very professional

1126
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:44,180
She wouldn't have done
anything fake

1127
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:45,420
She is perplexing

1128
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:55,540
Good morning, mam

1129
01:00:55,580 --> 01:00:57,500
- Has the editor came?
- He went for lunch

1130
01:00:57,540 --> 01:00:59,100
- This is the final day footage
- Okay

1131
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:01,020
Give this to editor and tell him
to edit it immediately...

1132
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:03,140
as documentary titled,
'Draupathi's vow'

1133
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:06,980
Now, her phone signal shows Chennai
You do one thing

1134
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:09,500
Go to her office
Let's follow her from there

1135
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:12,540
Hi, Bala!

1136
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:14,060
How about the
final day shoot, Rania?

1137
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:15,020
Let it be

1138
01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:16,380
What happened to
the register office bytes?

1139
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:17,300
Any clues?

1140
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:19,700
I have seen the whole footage
You better check it, once

1141
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:27,340
Next

1142
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:29,260
Next

1143
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:31,220
Hey, wait!

1144
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:33,980
Freeze it

1145
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:52,580
Hello!

1146
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:56,140
Kokila mam, I've sent you a photo
Look at it and call me immediately

1147
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:57,060
Okay

1148
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:02,660
Give this prescription in
the pharmacy and get the medicines

1149
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:03,780
Okay, Doctor

1150
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:18,060
Is this the place?

1151
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:24,740
- Where is her office?
- This is the office

1152
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:28,060
Have you seen it?

1153
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:30,060
He is Draudapathi's husband
Prabhakaran, right?

1154
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:32,660
Yes, mam
Wonder, how he came there

1155
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:34,660
He is selling tea at the registrar office

1156
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:37,980
He'd have done the murders
to take revenge

1157
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:39,100
Don't hurry

1158
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:41,700
Meet him immediately
and bring him to me

1159
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:43,500
- I'll talk to him
- Okay, mam

1160
01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:45,340
I'll meet him
and call you immediately

1161
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:57,620
Sir!

1162
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:01,260
I'm coming
I'm waiting for you

1163
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:03,700
What Prabha?
Didn't Manickam come?

1164
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:04,380
No, sir

1165
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:06,020
Sit down

1166
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:11,500
Have you brought the money?

1167
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:12,140
Yes, I have

1168
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:13,500
Just a minute
I'll come

1169
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:19,300
Sir, she is Rania Varma

1170
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:29,180
I'll start soon

1171
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:32,020
I have finished the pooja
I'll start

1172
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:35,060
Have you brought the money?

1173
01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:37,260
Give me

1174
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:38,420
Take this

1175
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:40,100
It's getting late for train
I must go

1176
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:46,700
Two, four, six, eight, ten, fourteen

1177
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:48,460
Sir!

1178
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:49,740
- What?
- Look here

1179
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:50,780
Any spelling mistake?

1180
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:52,340
- You look at it, you will understand
- Give me

1181
01:03:55,180 --> 01:03:58,220
- Is it her death certificate?
- Yes

1182
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:02,660
- Are you from CBI or Vigilance?
- A victim

1183
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:16,260
- Bala, where did you see him?
- Inside here

1184
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:19,660
This might be the register office
she tweeted about

1185
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:20,740
She has come here

1186
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:21,860
Yes

1187
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:23,540
Don't know what is she
going to do

1188
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:25,980
How many fake marriages
have you signed in so far?

1189
01:04:26,020 --> 01:04:27,980
Almost 3200 marriages

1190
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:30,420
The suicide of farmers,
the suicide for debts

1191
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:33,100
Half of the people who died
like this have daughters

1192
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:37,020
Do you know how many lives were
sacrificed because of your fake signature?

1193
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:40,460
Your death is more important

1194
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:44,980
You drink this and die

1195
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:47,300
If you don't drink this and die,
I'll release this on media

1196
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:49,700
So your whole family
will hang to death

1197
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:53,420
I interviewed him in that Bhai shop

1198
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:54,380
This place?

1199
01:04:55,140 --> 01:04:56,740
But, he isn't there now

1200
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:59,580
The person who is wearing the hat
has given interview, isn't it?

1201
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:02,300
- Yes, Rania
- I'll wait near the bike

1202
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:04,060
Talk something to him
and bring him

1203
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:04,820
Okay

1204
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:09,500
My name is Neela narayanan
I'm the Sub-registrar in Royapuram

1205
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:11,260
Why I'm on LIVE is

1206
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:14,980
6 months before without the couple
lakshmi and Saravanan's consent...

1207
01:05:15,020 --> 01:05:18,660
...I registered their marriage
and issued the certificate

1208
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:23,700
I have registered 3200
fake marriages so far

1209
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:28,060
Where there is no consent
of the parents as well as the girls

1210
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:32,100
When the advocates and the Politicians
have threatened me,

1211
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:35,220
I've registered the marriage of
girls with whom they mention

1212
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:36,700
I have done this for money

1213
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:40,340
My conscience is killing me
I have committed a big sin

1214
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:43,900
To rectify this, I've decided
to die by consuming poison

1215
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:46,620
Should I take it for sure?

1216
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:51,020
I apologize to my wife
and to my daughter

1217
01:05:56,740 --> 01:05:58,660
- Bhai, she is our mam
- Greetings, mam

1218
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:01,180
I must meet him
Do you know where is he now?

1219
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:03,780
He went out

1220
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:06,300
Is there any contact number of him?

1221
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:07,780
He doesn't have a phone

1222
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:09,180
Can you tell me his address?

1223
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:13,460
He came here two weeks ago
I don't know much about him

1224
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:14,780
This is my card

1225
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:16,060
When he comes here, tell him

1226
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:17,980
I need to talk something important
about his spouse Draupathi

1227
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:19,940
- Ask him to call me
- Your name?

1228
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:21,980
Tell him as Draupathi
He will understand

1229
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:22,700
Okay

1230
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:24,020
What's your contact number?

1231
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:29,660
Let's go

1232
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:33,620

01:06:35,940 --> 01:06:38,060
Hello, I need to check
your phone

1234
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:40,940
Excuse me, who are you?
Why should I give my phone?

1235
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:42,780
Excuse me, we are from CCP department

01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:45,500
We are inquiring regarding a murder
Answer to our queries

Rania, we are following you
on looking your tweet

01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:50,220
I guess, you have connected
the scenario

1239
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:52,060
What are you inquiring with him?

1240
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:53,140
Please give me

1241
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:59,460
- Why are you inquiring him?
- He is my friend Draupathi's husband

1242
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:02,140
This person with beard,
is he selling tea here?

1243
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:02,940
Yes

1244
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:04,500
Anbu, collect the whole details
about him

1245
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:05,420
Yes, sir

1246
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:07,780
What's between you and him?
Just a minute

1247
01:07:09,740 --> 01:07:10,900
- Arun!
- Yes, sir

1248
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:12,420
- Where are you?
- I'm in an inquiry

1249
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:14,660
The Royapuram registrar has
attempted suicide on LIVE in Facebook

1250
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:16,020
Oh, shit
Is it?

1251
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:19,220
- You go to the spot, immediately
- Okay, I'll go immediately, sir

1252
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:22,860
The registrar you tweeted has
attempted suicide on LIVE in Facebook

1253
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:25,700
Bring her
Come on

1254
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:26,620
Come on, mam

1255
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:28,700
- Come on
- Oh, no!

1256
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:39,500
What happened to the registrar?

1257
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:41,020
He has been taken
to the hospital, sir

1258
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:43,220
The forensic team is coming
to take the finger prints

1259
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:44,500
We are waiting for that

1260
01:07:44,580 --> 01:07:45,660
Okay

1261
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:52,700
KVa lo

1262
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:56,580
Sir, just now we have sent
a photo and got the details of it

1263
01:07:56,620 --> 01:07:59,460
Sir, the accused name is Prabhakaran
He belongs to Villupuram

1264
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:01,660
Since his wife's sister was
married to other caste,

1265
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:04,660
he had killed his wife
and that girl and was arrested

1266
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:08,420
He got bail fifteen days ago
So, he is already an accused

1267
01:08:13,660 --> 01:08:16,100
Bhai, here is twenty five
thousand rupees

1268
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:17,780
Get your eye treatment
done with this money

1269
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:18,660
Brother!

1270
01:08:18,740 --> 01:08:20,940
Think of me as your elder brother
and take it

1271
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:24,740
Brother, I'll repay you
as soon as possible

1272
01:08:24,780 --> 01:08:27,180
He is murdering the people
related to register marriage,

1273
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:28,540
like advocate, politician
and the registrar

1274
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:29,020
Yes, sir

1275
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:31,460
He is very dangerous
He has to be killed

1276
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:36,500
Ask to round up the registrar office
Tell to arrest him if he comes

1277
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:37,420
Yes, sir

1278
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:39,380
My work is over, Bhai
I'll leave

1279
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:42,620
Brother, few minutes before,
a sir and a mam inquired

1280
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:43,820
about you showing your photo

1281
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:45,140
I told them you've been
to the registrar house

1282
01:08:45,220 --> 01:08:47,060
She told you to call
when you come

1283
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:48,300
She has given
the contact number too

1284
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:50,580
She told she needs
to talk about Draupathi

1285
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:51,740
Draupathi?

1286
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:55,460
Bhai, call that number
and give me

1287
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:05,020
Who is that?

1288
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:06,860
A call from the registrar office

1289
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:09,660
- It must be him
- Yes, sir

1290
01:09:09,780 --> 01:09:13,020
Tell him something and ask him
to come to pencil factory ground

1291
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:16,020
Hello!
- I'm Prabhakar speaking

1292
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:17,380
Draupathi is alive

1293
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:21,380
- Who are you?
- I'm Draupathi's friend speaking

1294
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:23,020
If you want to meet her,

1295
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:24,740
Come immediately to
pencil factory ground

1296
01:09:24,820 --> 01:09:25,620
I'll come

1297
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:27,300
Bhai, I'll be back

1298
01:09:30,780 --> 01:09:32,700
- Let's go
- Come, let's go

1299
01:10:09,820 --> 01:10:10,820
Is it you?

1300
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:12,860
Is Draupathi alive?

1301
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:15,060
Are you telling the truth?
Where is she? Tell me

1302
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:16,340
How did you find me?

1303
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:18,900
Leave it Where is she?
Tell me

1304
01:10:18,940 --> 01:10:20,860
I didn't even see her face

1305
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:23,100
Where is Draupathi?

1306
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:25,500
Tell me, please
Where is Draupathi?

1307
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:35,180
Very nice
Excellent!

1308
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:37,140
I thought of catching you
by encounter

1309
01:10:37,420 --> 01:10:39,900
When said your wife's name,
you got caught on your own

1310
01:10:39,980 --> 01:10:41,860
Hey, is it you
who did five murders?

1311
01:10:41,940 --> 01:10:42,820
Yes, sir

1312
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:45,020
Do you think you will be
remanded easily?

1313
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:47,180
It'll be interesting
if two bullets pierce in

1314
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:49,740
Is Draupathi alive or not?
At least, tell me that

1315
01:10:49,820 --> 01:10:50,780
Please

1316
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:53,220
What an acting?
Casteist

1317
01:10:53,860 --> 01:10:56,340
You murdered your wife
and asking whether she is alive?

1318
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:57,220
Sir!

1319
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:01,940
Lock him

1320
01:11:02,380 --> 01:11:03,100
Down him

1321
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:04,340
Don't do anything to him

1322
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:05,460
You...

1323
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:07,780
Don't shoot him, please

1324
01:11:07,980 --> 01:11:08,700
Go away

1325
01:11:08,780 --> 01:11:11,860
If you publish anywhere about
this incident, you too will be linked

1326
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:15,420
Please, listen to me
He didn't kill Draupathi

1327
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:19,140
In fact, Draupathi is not dead
She is alive

1328
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:27,140
What are you saying?

1329
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:36,260
If this is not true,
I'll shoot you too

1330
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:38,540
Take him away

1331
01:12:21,580 --> 01:12:24,540
Prabhakar, I'm coming from
the hospital now

1332
01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:26,100
Like Rania said,
your wife didn't die

1333
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:27,500
She is alive

1334
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:30,700
To investigate the redanillo case,
AC has appointed me

1335
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:33,260
But, this case is connected
with your old case

1336
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:37,460
If only you can tell clearly
what happened, I can submit the report

1337
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:39,620
Sir, I can't say anything now

1338
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:40,860
To turn me as an approver,

1339
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:45,220
I think you've threatened her
to say that my wife Draupathi is alive

1340
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:47,580
I too thought she was lying
to get you here

1341
01:12:47,660 --> 01:12:50,100
But, she didn't lie
It's true

1342
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:53,140
So, tell me what happened
in Draupathi case

1343
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:55,500
Let me tell you
in my experience

1344
01:12:56,060 --> 01:12:58,260
We cannot trust these policemen

1345
01:12:58,580 --> 01:13:02,380
Show me my wife Draupathi
I'll answer whatever you ask

1346
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:05,220
You've seen such kind of cops, right?

1347
01:13:05,260 --> 01:13:06,100
- Anbu
- Yes, sir

1348
01:13:06,140 --> 01:13:07,500
- That video?
- I'm giving, sir

1349
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:25,500
Dear!

1350
01:13:32,860 --> 01:13:33,900
Give it to me

1351
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:43,060
Sir!
How is it possible, sir!

1352
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:45,580
I didn't see her face till the end

1353
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:49,020
But, I don't understand anything
I'm perplexed

1354
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:51,020
I too don't have
any clear idea about it

1355
01:13:51,980 --> 01:13:53,780
Only if you clearly state
what happened to your wife,

1356
01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:55,940
I can take the next step

1357
01:13:55,980 --> 01:13:58,460
I'll tell you everything
I'll do everything you say

1358
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:00,500
But, I want to see my wife Draupathi

1359
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:01,260
That's all

1360
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:02,700
Sure
Tell me

1361
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:11,260
You've to catch him right away

1362
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:15,580
Only after he arrives,
I too will be aware what happened

1363
01:14:15,620 --> 01:14:18,100
- Is this his address?
- Now he is not there

1364
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:21,260
Do you've his phone number?

1365
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:23,020
I have
How could I forget it?

1366
01:14:23,060 --> 01:14:25,580
Tell me that number
I'll get him here by tonight

1367
01:14:25,620 --> 01:14:28,540
But, you should tell me
everything after that

1368
01:14:28,580 --> 01:14:29,460
Definitely

1369
01:14:30,380 --> 01:14:31,500
Look after him

1370
01:14:32,540 --> 01:14:34,700
- Anbu, shall we go?
- Let's go, sir

1371
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:45,100
Mr Gurudev, why did you file
this public welfare case?

1372
01:14:45,140 --> 01:14:49,820
Yesterday, a Sub-registrar has posted
a LIVE video in Facebook

1373
01:14:50,060 --> 01:14:53,300
For a woman
who died six months ago,

1374
01:14:53,420 --> 01:14:55,700
He conducted the register marriage, now

1375
01:14:55,740 --> 01:14:58,740
Moreover, without the bride
and groom,

1376
01:14:58,780 --> 01:15:05,980
he had registered
almost 3200 fake marriages

1377
01:15:06,020 --> 01:15:09,140
Now, he attempted suicide
by consuming poison

1378
01:15:09,180 --> 01:15:11,620
Being an Indian citizen,
for both men and women

1379
01:15:11,660 --> 01:15:15,140
When it sounds that
fake marriages happen,

1380
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:19,300
If that is certain,
then a protection is needed for them

1381
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:21,820
not only for themselves
but also for their parents,

1382
01:15:21,860 --> 01:15:24,500
and to their family dignity

1383
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:27,060
Moreover, by such fake marriages,

1384
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:30,740
a clan who is trying to make
money on them

1385
01:15:30,780 --> 01:15:32,860
If they grow up like this,

1386
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:35,420
it'll become one of the biggest
stigma in the Indian nation

1387
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:39,980
Therefore, for this bride and groom,
those who are not married

1388
01:15:40,060 --> 01:15:45,340
this forum need to create
a new and protective law, immediately

1389
01:15:45,380 --> 01:15:50,180
For that purpose,
I filed this welfare case, my lord

1390
01:15:50,220 --> 01:15:52,380
Shall I watch that video, Mr.Gurudev?

1391
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:06,140
Considering about the health
of the person in this video

1392
01:16:06,180 --> 01:16:09,340
and to know the fact
of what he said,

1393
01:16:09,380 --> 01:16:13,740
A report should be submitted
in 24 hours

1394
01:16:13,780 --> 01:16:17,860
I order the DGP of police
and the District Registrar

1395
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:19,020
Thank you, lord

1396
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:21,420
Come on

1397
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:28,940
- Is this him?
- Yes

1398
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:31,060
Sir, why did you bring me here?

1399
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:32,500
The case is in proceedings
in the court

1400
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:34,340
- I need to talk to my advocate
- Do you need to talk to advocate?

1401
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:35,780
Don't hit me, sir

1402
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:37,540
Sir, do you know who am I?

1403
01:16:37,580 --> 01:16:39,180
I'm not bothered whoever you're

1404
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:40,700
Dare to give a fake address

1405
01:16:40,740 --> 01:16:41,940
Fraudulent

1406
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:44,060
Sir!

1407
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:45,700
He must be killed, sir

1408
01:16:45,740 --> 01:16:47,940
If you speak anything else,
I'll bury you here

1409
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:50,260
Get lost
Sit there

1410
01:16:50,660 --> 01:16:52,220
Get the camera ready

1411
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:00,340
The registrar is still alive

1412
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:01,780
But, because of the issue he said,

1413
01:17:01,820 --> 01:17:03,700
A public welfare case
has been filed in the court

1414
01:17:03,740 --> 01:17:05,700
So, I should submit a report

1415
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:08,180
You convey everything boldly
in front of this camera

1416
01:17:11,740 --> 01:17:13,380
Draupathi is my uncle's daughter

1417
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:16,500
We fell in love and
got married only two years ago

1418
01:17:16,820 --> 01:17:18,860
We led our life happily

1419
01:17:19,820 --> 01:17:21,740
Draupathi is like fire

1420
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:24,460
Wherever things go wrong,
she will oppose, courageously

1421
01:17:25,620 --> 01:17:29,540
Don't destroy the ground water

1422
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:35,180
Don't destroy...don't destroy
Don't destroy the ground water

1423
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:37,980
Don't steal don't steal

1424
01:17:38,140 --> 01:17:40,020
Lakshmi is the daughter
of Draupathi's uncle

1425
01:17:40,060 --> 01:17:42,020
She is doing final year MSW

1426
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:46,500
Draupathi's uncle name
is Damodara Vathiyar

1427
01:17:47,060 --> 01:17:50,500
Nothing will happen in the village
without his consent

1428
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:56,100
Myself and Draupathi have trained
many people in our hometown

1429
01:17:56,140 --> 01:17:59,180
through martial arts and training centre

1430
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:03,500
Naveena got married
and her husband is a tailor

1431
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:06,100
With his small income,
she runs her family

1432
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:10,060
On weekends, she attended
the free training in our center

1433
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:13,900
Today, she cleared Group II exam
and took up the Government job

1434
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:16,660
This is the complete development
of a woman

1435
01:18:16,740 --> 01:18:18,260
Don't be afraid of him

1436
01:18:20,580 --> 01:18:22,460
Education alone is not enough
for women

1437
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:24,620
That should be an education
towards power

1438
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:28,540
I wish you to be here
cherishing your success, in future

1439
01:18:28,580 --> 01:18:29,700
Look there

1440
01:18:29,740 --> 01:18:33,380
I'm giving a small gift
to Naveena sister

1441
01:18:34,420 --> 01:18:37,140
So, let's meet next week
You all can leave

1442
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:39,380
Thilaga and Lakshmi stay back

1443
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:42,220
You can leave

1444
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:48,820
Thilaga, what's your problem?

1445
01:18:48,860 --> 01:18:50,860
You will never be like this

1446
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:53,140
Lakshmi, tell me what's the problem

1447
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:56,700
Sister, a guy proposed her
and follows her around

1448
01:18:56,740 --> 01:18:58,420
She didn't like him at all

1449
01:18:58,460 --> 01:19:01,540
Though she refused him,
he is very troublesome

1450
01:19:01,660 --> 01:19:03,380
Is he torturing you?

1451
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:06,060
Tell me without weeping

1452
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:09,820
Sister, he took my photo from FB,
morphed it in wrong way

1453
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:13,180
and now threatening me
that he will post it

1454
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:14,460
I'm feared

1455
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:16,940
If he does something
like that, I'll die

1456
01:19:16,980 --> 01:19:18,060
Are you a fool?

1457
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:20,100
What kind of lineage you were
born into and talking like this?

1458
01:19:20,140 --> 01:19:21,540
Where will he be, now?

1459
01:19:35,140 --> 01:19:40,620
Brother!

1460
01:19:40,740 --> 01:19:41,380
If anyone…

1461
01:19:41,420 --> 01:19:42,580
- Don't hit
- Get lost

1462
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:45,660
Brother!

1463
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:47,300
Why are you tying?

1464
01:19:48,020 --> 01:19:49,660
Don't tie, brother
It's painful

1465
01:19:50,260 --> 01:19:51,420
Come

1466
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:53,140
Brother

1467
01:19:56,740 --> 01:19:58,140
Is this rogue?

1468
01:19:58,180 --> 01:19:59,220
Yes, sister

1469
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:02,140
Where is your phone?

1470
01:20:03,420 --> 01:20:04,500
What's the password?

1471
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:06,060
2354

1472
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:12,700
Brother, check is there anything else?

1473
01:20:13,220 --> 01:20:14,620
You will be spared

1474
01:20:14,980 --> 01:20:16,980
Why are you staring at her?

1475
01:20:18,940 --> 01:20:20,900
Hey, Draupathi!
Don't do

1476
01:20:20,940 --> 01:20:23,820
Sister, I did unknowingly

1477
01:20:23,860 --> 01:20:25,060
Sister!

1478
01:20:28,580 --> 01:20:30,500
Great! He escaped

1479
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:33,700
Brother, take him a video

1480
01:20:34,660 --> 01:20:38,180
Brother, don't take video
I feel ashamed

1481
01:20:39,060 --> 01:20:41,180
Brother! Don't take video

1482
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:43,900
Is nudity a shame
only to women?

1483
01:20:43,940 --> 01:20:46,820
Not for you?
Don't you have a family?

1484
01:20:46,860 --> 01:20:52,860
If her morphed photo is posted,
I'll upload this video in Facebook

1485
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:54,660
Sister, don't do anything like that

1486
01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:56,460
I'll not do any mistake, hereafter

1487
01:20:56,540 --> 01:20:59,940
If you think of doing
this mistake again,

1488
01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:04,220
I've just torn the trousers now
Next time, I'll damage it

1489
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:07,580
Hey, do it properly

1490
01:21:09,740 --> 01:21:11,140
Lift it

1491
01:21:11,180 --> 01:21:12,780
Don't reduce the speed

1492
01:21:16,060 --> 01:21:16,860
Uncle!

1493
01:21:18,260 --> 01:21:19,140
Greetings!

1494
01:21:19,180 --> 01:21:21,980
Son-in-law, do at least three people
reach the state level this time?

1495
01:21:22,220 --> 01:21:25,180
At least, four to five people
will join the Government job

1496
01:21:25,220 --> 01:21:27,420
Where is Draupathi, uncle?
The children are waiting

1497
01:21:27,460 --> 01:21:29,540
- Don't know where she went
- Don't you know, son-in-law?

1498
01:21:29,580 --> 01:21:31,420
Something went wrong in
the '100 days job scheme'

1499
01:21:31,460 --> 01:21:32,940
She went to take a video of it

1500
01:21:37,700 --> 01:21:40,340
Why are you here, Draupathi?
Didn't you teach for the children?

1501
01:21:40,380 --> 01:21:43,460
That's in the evening, aunt
I just came here

1502
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:44,980
- You go
- Okay, dear

1503
01:21:58,020 --> 01:21:59,260
- Greetings, sir
- Greetings, mam

1504
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:02,100
Sir, they didn't even work
for two hours

1505
01:22:02,140 --> 01:22:03,740
The rainy season is approaching

1506
01:22:03,820 --> 01:22:05,460
The job they do should
be useful, isn't it?

1507
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:06,820
Where do they listen to me?

1508
01:22:06,860 --> 01:22:09,540
They ask me whether it's
the Government money or your money?

1509
01:22:23,020 --> 01:22:24,260
Why are you here, dear?

1510
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:25,180
Let it be

1511
01:22:25,220 --> 01:22:26,740
What fault are you going
to find with them?

1512
01:22:26,780 --> 01:22:29,780
Hunting head lice, back talking and
sleeping with snoring noise

1513
01:22:29,860 --> 01:22:33,180
That's what, they do here
So, I recorded it

1514
01:22:33,220 --> 01:22:35,460
If you take a video of them,
don't they mistake you, dear?

1515
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:37,900
They should know, isn't it?

1516
01:22:38,540 --> 01:22:41,180
This is a pen camera
Open and see it

1517
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:46,020
Wonder at this!
Look at this, uncle

1518
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:49,380
Dear, what you said is right
But, it's the Government project

1519
01:22:49,420 --> 01:22:51,300
What solution will you get
if you post this on Facebook?

1520
01:22:51,340 --> 01:22:52,580
Not that, dear

1521
01:22:52,780 --> 01:22:58,060
The video you're going to shoot
and the video I shot already

1522
01:22:58,100 --> 01:23:01,100
will be sent to
the Prime minister's office

1523
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:02,540
Oh, how will you communicate
with them?

1524
01:23:02,580 --> 01:23:05,140
Today, there is communication
facility through internet

1525
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:08,780
right from the Prime minister
to the Councillor

1526
01:23:08,820 --> 01:23:11,100
You've taken up a good job

1527
01:23:11,140 --> 01:23:13,380
Since this project came up,
no one comes to work

1528
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:15,300
in the fields and to pick flowers

1529
01:23:15,620 --> 01:23:18,020
Agriculture has been ruined

1530
01:23:34,220 --> 01:23:35,380
Lakshmi, what's this?

1531
01:23:35,420 --> 01:23:36,740
Packaged water in our house!

1532
01:23:36,780 --> 01:23:38,700
Sister, after drinking
mineral water in college

1533
01:23:38,740 --> 01:23:40,300
the water at home
doesn't quench thirst

1534
01:23:40,340 --> 01:23:40,940
That's why

1535
01:23:40,980 --> 01:23:42,420
How much is the cost
of each can?

1536
01:23:42,460 --> 01:23:44,620
- It's Rs.30
- Rs.30?

1537
01:23:44,700 --> 01:23:47,100
One pot of water was sold
for a rupee

1538
01:23:47,140 --> 01:23:49,900
This seems to be costlier
than the soft drinks

1539
01:23:49,980 --> 01:23:51,620
You share a video
about this, later

1540
01:23:51,660 --> 01:23:53,500
Now, it's getting late
for college Come, let's go

1541
01:23:53,540 --> 01:23:55,260
You too tease me?

1542
01:24:01,580 --> 01:24:02,820
- Greetings, doctor!
- Hi, aunty!

1543
01:24:02,860 --> 01:24:04,860
- How are you both?
- We are good

1544
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:07,660
Doctor, I get positive energy
when I see you

1545
01:24:07,700 --> 01:24:10,140
It's you who stay positive
all the time, Draupathi

1546
01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:13,100
I'll watch your awareness videos
whenever I've time

1547
01:24:13,140 --> 01:24:14,660
Gifted girl you are

1548
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:15,940
- Shall we go?
- Okay, aunty

1549
01:24:15,980 --> 01:24:18,460
- It's time for college
- I'm leaving, sister

1550
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:20,220
Lakshmi, you're doing final year
Take care

1551
01:24:20,260 --> 01:24:21,420
Okay, aunty

1552
01:24:39,260 --> 01:24:41,380
Don't go, doctor
Greetings, doctor

1553
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:43,140
You need to check
one more patient, doctor

1554
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:44,620
- Who is that?
- Come here

1555
01:24:45,060 --> 01:24:46,380
It's Draupathi, doctor

1556
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:48,940
What's the problem with Draupathi?
Nothing, doctor

1557
01:24:49,220 --> 01:24:51,740
We have been waiting for
two years since marriage

1558
01:24:51,780 --> 01:24:53,540
We are yet to be blessed
with a child

1559
01:24:53,700 --> 01:24:54,900
That's the problem, doctor

1560
01:24:54,940 --> 01:24:56,260
- Dear!
- You be quiet

1561
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:59,100
I thought you're in planning

1562
01:24:59,180 --> 01:25:01,140
I'll give you tablets
Take it

1563
01:25:01,180 --> 01:25:01,740
Okay, doctor

1564
01:25:01,780 --> 01:25:02,980
In one or two months,
you will get a good news

1565
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:06,180
Oh, no! No need of medicines, doctor
Let it happen naturally

1566
01:25:06,220 --> 01:25:07,020
Will you be quiet?

1567
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:08,780
We are waiting for almost
two years

1568
01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:12,100
You shouldn't make him to wait
when he is desperate to have a child

1569
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:15,020
The day, when we started using
sanitary pads

1570
01:25:15,060 --> 01:25:18,540
the corporate had
decided when should we've a baby

1571
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:20,260
Don't fear

1572
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:22,980
It's just iron and vitamin tablets
You can take

1573
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:24,900
- Okay, doctor
- I'm leaving

1574
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:28,620
You'd have watched 'Kiki challenge'
and 'Ice bucket challenge' and many more

1575
01:25:28,660 --> 01:25:32,180
Similarly, this is a challenge of
"let's grow trees along with children"

1576
01:25:32,220 --> 01:25:35,860
The adults at home should plant
a sapling with their children

1577
01:25:35,900 --> 01:25:38,100
and must take a video

1578
01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:40,940
Children should take pride
in not raising their pet dog

1579
01:25:40,980 --> 01:25:43,620
or fish in a tank

1580
01:25:43,660 --> 01:25:46,660
When they plant a sapling
and grow along with it

1581
01:25:46,700 --> 01:25:51,300
and when they stand under
it's shadow and look high,

1582
01:25:51,340 --> 01:25:53,940
that pleasure is the pride

1583
01:25:53,980 --> 01:25:56,100
Shall we all go
to plant saplings now?

1584
01:25:56,140 --> 01:25:57,620
- Let's go, sister
- Come on

1585
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:05,740
Superb!

1586
01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:13,460
Kabaddi Kabaddi

1587
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:15,100
It's enough

1588
01:26:17,020 --> 01:26:19,300
Just a minute
Tell me, doctor

1589
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:21,620
- How are you?
- I'm good, Draupathi

1590
01:26:21,980 --> 01:26:25,020
It's a good deed that you made
the children to plant saplings

1591
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:26,020
Thank you, doctor

1592
01:26:26,060 --> 01:26:28,620
- Actually, it's all because of you, doctor
- Thank you, dear

1593
01:26:28,780 --> 01:26:33,060
Rania, a you tuber from Chennai
is coming to take your interview

1594
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:35,260
She is very brilliant
Similar to you

1595
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:36,580
A social activist

1596
01:26:37,140 --> 01:26:39,620
Tell Prabhakaran to pick her up

1597
01:26:40,660 --> 01:26:44,300
Rania Varma and Draupathi met
each other for first time

1598
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:47,220
They can both think alike

1599
01:26:48,860 --> 01:26:53,220
Draupathi, the Doctor and Rania Varma,
since then, this trio together had done

1600
01:26:53,260 --> 01:26:54,740
lot of good things in our village

1601
01:26:55,820 --> 01:26:58,020
The thing which I had been
expecting for long time

1602
01:26:58,060 --> 01:26:59,180
happened on that day

1603
01:27:09,180 --> 01:27:11,820
Dear, why are you looking dull?
Aren't you well?

1604
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:14,660
No, dear
I feel dizzy

1605
01:27:14,820 --> 01:27:17,740
Is the date postponed?

1606
01:27:17,780 --> 01:27:20,580
Yes, dear
It's been ten to fifteen days

1607
01:27:33,100 --> 01:27:34,540
Welcome!

1608
01:27:34,580 --> 01:27:36,140
- Greetings, doctor
- Be seated

1609
01:27:36,780 --> 01:27:39,860
Anything special in village?
Both of you've come together

1610
01:27:39,900 --> 01:27:42,580
You've to check and tell,
is anything special in my house?

1611
01:27:42,620 --> 01:27:45,020
All of a sudden, she felt dizziness
and not hungry too

1612
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:47,060
You've to check and say
is there anything good

1613
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:48,660
Prabhakar, you wait outside

1614
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:50,460
- I'll check and tell you
- Okay, doctor

1615
01:28:05,540 --> 01:28:08,140
Doctor is calling you in

1616
01:28:13,820 --> 01:28:16,540
This is normal dizziness, Prabhakar

1617
01:28:17,660 --> 01:28:19,780
She will be alright
if taken rest for two days

1618
01:28:20,700 --> 01:28:22,580
Okay, doctor
I will take care of her

1619
01:28:23,660 --> 01:28:26,460
Is she regularly
taking the tablets I gave?

1620
01:28:26,540 --> 01:28:28,620
Yes, doctor
I'm giving her

1621
01:28:28,660 --> 01:28:30,260
Is it?
Very good

1622
01:28:30,740 --> 01:28:34,580
Congratulations, Prabhakar!
The pregnancy is confirmed

1623
01:28:36,460 --> 01:28:38,420
Eight weeks of growth

1624
01:28:38,540 --> 01:28:41,460
Give her whatever
she is fond of

1625
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:42,340
Okay, doctor

1626
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:44,580
- Ensure she is happy
- I'll take care, doctor

1627
01:29:03,380 --> 01:29:07,500

1628
01:29:07,540 --> 01:29:11,940

"A poem written in the language of god"

1633
01:29:24,180 --> 01:29:28,140
"It brought life to the soul"

1634
01:29:28,180 --> 01:29:30,460
"What's more you need?"

1635
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:32,540
"This birth is enough"

1636
01:29:32,580 --> 01:29:34,660
"Enough, this is enough"

1637
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:37,340
"My royal life will extend"

1638
01:29:39,020 --> 01:29:43,140

1655
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:09,140
"So I feel happy in my life"

1656
01:31:09,180 --> 01:31:13,380

1657
01:31:13,420 --> 01:31:17,700

01:31:34,300 --> 01:31:36,220
"What's more you need?"

1664
01:31:36,260 --> 01:31:38,340
"This birth is enough"

1665
01:31:38,380 --> 01:31:40,460
"Enough, this is enough"

1666
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:43,140

1671
01:31:57,300 --> 01:32:01,860
"Will feel astonishing till the root"

1672
01:32:12,820 --> 01:32:15,180
Collect details about
hydro carbon project

1673
01:32:15,220 --> 01:32:17,660
- Let's post a video, tomorrow
- Okay

1674
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:19,620
- Greetings, brother
- Greetings!

1675
01:32:19,660 --> 01:32:20,300
Tell me

1676
01:32:20,340 --> 01:32:23,660
Arumugam, the neighborhood
land owner had given his land

1677
01:32:23,700 --> 01:32:25,380
for lease to outsiders

1678
01:32:25,420 --> 01:32:27,620
He sucks the bore water
to containers and selling it

1679
01:32:27,660 --> 01:32:31,100
How can we do agriculture, then?

1680
01:32:31,140 --> 01:32:32,820
If it continues, won't the
ground water get dry?

1681
01:32:32,860 --> 01:32:34,660
You've to stop it

1682
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:42,780
Instead of doing farming,
do they both steal water?

1683
01:32:44,060 --> 01:32:47,020
Arumugam, despite knowing
the rules of our village,

1684
01:32:47,060 --> 01:32:48,580
you've given the land
to outsiders for lease

1685
01:32:48,620 --> 01:32:49,620
Nothing like that, brother

1686
01:32:49,660 --> 01:32:51,100
I can't live against
the principles of village

1687
01:32:51,140 --> 01:32:52,940
I'll obey the village rules

1688
01:32:52,980 --> 01:32:54,180
Being aware of the
water resources of our village,

1689
01:32:54,220 --> 01:32:55,820
They have targeted Arumugam

1690
01:33:03,380 --> 01:33:04,540
What's the problem here?

1691
01:33:04,580 --> 01:33:08,700
You've stopped my vehicles,
held my men and brought me here

1692
01:33:08,740 --> 01:33:11,340
Didn't your men tell you
what's the problem here?

1693
01:33:11,380 --> 01:33:14,380
They told me
Is it you who creates ruckus?

1694
01:33:14,420 --> 01:33:17,820
Hey, you talk out of the way in city

1695
01:33:17,860 --> 01:33:20,780
Talk respectfully, here
Else, I'll bang you

1696
01:33:22,340 --> 01:33:25,260
Dear, why are you talking to him?

1697
01:33:25,300 --> 01:33:28,060
We will solve the issue
with Arumugam brother

1698
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:30,500
I'm not bothered whether you talk
with Arumugam or with his father?

1699
01:33:30,540 --> 01:33:32,180
I've invested three lakhs
on the whole

1700
01:33:32,220 --> 01:33:34,540
Don't we know
about your calculations?

1701
01:33:34,580 --> 01:33:38,340
A water can costs Rs30
You earn Rs3000 for a tank

1702
01:33:38,420 --> 01:33:41,420
So far, you've taken
500 tanks of water

1703
01:33:41,460 --> 01:33:43,340
If we calculate all those,

1704
01:33:43,380 --> 01:33:45,580
you've to leave your vehicles
here and go

1705
01:33:45,660 --> 01:33:46,380
Go...go

1706
01:33:46,420 --> 01:33:47,940
What?
Should I go?

1707
01:33:47,980 --> 01:33:49,660
I'm an advocate
I'm not a goof

1708
01:33:49,740 --> 01:33:51,420
I've the lease document

1709
01:33:52,420 --> 01:33:54,740
For another six months,
We will do whatever we want

1710
01:33:54,780 --> 01:33:57,740
No one has the right to ask
I've the document

1711
01:33:57,780 --> 01:34:02,700
Hey, you can be law-abiding,
you might belong to any political party

1712
01:34:02,740 --> 01:34:04,660
This Panchayat will not suppress for you

1713
01:34:04,700 --> 01:34:08,620
This is not the city, eating pizza
and burger following the consumer culture

1714
01:34:08,660 --> 01:34:11,100
It's a village where people
live unitedly

1715
01:34:11,140 --> 01:34:13,020
It's the bad time for Arumugam

1716
01:34:13,060 --> 01:34:14,820
He leased out his land
for an outsider

1717
01:34:15,140 --> 01:34:16,820
The rule of this village is,

1718
01:34:16,900 --> 01:34:19,300
Nothing should be done
under three feet below

1719
01:34:19,340 --> 01:34:21,620
When that is the case,
you've digged down to thirty feet,

1720
01:34:21,660 --> 01:34:24,420
and have taken water
Who gave you this right?

1721
01:34:26,060 --> 01:34:29,060
Show this document
wherever you can

1722
01:34:29,100 --> 01:34:33,580
We will decide who should come
to this village and who shouldn't

1723
01:34:33,620 --> 01:34:36,540
We must protect our natural resources
and should pass the same

1724
01:34:36,580 --> 01:34:37,820
to our next generation

1725
01:34:37,860 --> 01:34:41,020
Despite this, if you try to exploit
these natural resources,

1726
01:34:41,060 --> 01:34:43,780
That will not happen
until I'm alive

1727
01:34:43,860 --> 01:34:48,180
Thrash him and his men
wherever you see them

1728
01:34:48,220 --> 01:34:50,100
Whatever happens,
I'll take care

1729
01:34:56,540 --> 01:35:00,580
After that water issue,
only this wastrel is aware of the rest

1730
01:35:04,340 --> 01:35:05,700
How did they enter the village?

1731
01:35:05,740 --> 01:35:07,940
How did they do
this register marriage?

1732
01:35:07,980 --> 01:35:10,580
How did they scattered my family?

1733
01:35:12,180 --> 01:35:16,380
He is so furious, If we let him,
he will kill you like your advocate

1734
01:35:16,420 --> 01:35:17,340
Got it?

1735
01:35:17,380 --> 01:35:19,140
Answer my question properly

1736
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:21,900
How do you know Lakshmi?
How did you do the registration?

1737
01:35:21,940 --> 01:35:23,580
Tell me the entire details about it

1738
01:35:24,020 --> 01:35:26,860
- Anbu! Record it
- Okay, sir

1739
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:30,180
I swear, I don't know
they will do murder

1740
01:35:30,260 --> 01:35:33,220
Karuna brother will call us often
for meeting

1741
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:35,260
We, the guys will go
for the meeting

1742
01:35:37,580 --> 01:35:38,740
Greetings, brother

1743
01:35:38,820 --> 01:35:43,060
Arumugam, you took three lakhs
from me and acted smart before your clan

1744
01:35:43,100 --> 01:35:44,020
Apologize me, brother

1745
01:35:44,060 --> 01:35:46,020
What can I do against
the Panchayat?

1746
01:35:46,060 --> 01:35:49,460
I can't live in this village
if I go against the rules and vathiyar

1747
01:35:49,660 --> 01:35:54,100
Karuna, how the vathiyar family
humiliated us before everyone?

1748
01:35:54,140 --> 01:35:57,140
- We must do something, Karuna
- Yes, brother

1749
01:35:57,180 --> 01:36:00,660
- Shall we kill him?
- That is not easy

1750
01:36:00,820 --> 01:36:03,460
Though we kill him,
Draupathi will trouble us

1751
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:04,900
Her husband too will trouble

1752
01:36:04,940 --> 01:36:07,700
Not only that,
a big community is behind her

1753
01:36:08,420 --> 01:36:11,500
Arumugam, a girl was standing
at Panchayat on that day

1754
01:36:11,540 --> 01:36:13,900
- Is she vathiyar's daughter?
- Yes, her name is Lakshmi

1755
01:36:13,940 --> 01:36:15,980
She is studying in a college
near Villupuram

1756
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:19,260
Karuna, this issue is like
tasting sweet for you, isn't it?

1757
01:36:19,420 --> 01:36:22,460
Karuna, if we have to step
in his land,

1758
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:25,300
We ought to touch his daughter

1759
01:36:25,420 --> 01:36:28,580
Likewise, it's enough if we
scatter the dignity of Vathiyar

1760
01:36:28,620 --> 01:36:29,980
He will hang his head down

1761
01:36:30,060 --> 01:36:31,020
Let's do it, brother

1762
01:36:31,060 --> 01:36:33,940
I've prepared hundred people
in a district

1763
01:36:33,980 --> 01:36:36,820
I'll make her daughter elope
with our guy within a month

1764
01:36:36,860 --> 01:36:39,220
Suddenly, Karuna brother called
me and told me to come to Villupuram

1765
01:36:39,260 --> 01:36:40,180
I too went

1766
01:36:40,220 --> 01:36:41,780
- Brother, he is our guy
- Greetings, brother

1767
01:36:41,820 --> 01:36:43,980
Hey, he looks handsome

1768
01:36:44,020 --> 01:36:44,860
Do one thing

1769
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:47,020
Buy him a bike and an iPhone

1770
01:36:47,060 --> 01:36:49,740
Buy him a chain and get him
a college ID as if he is studying

1771
01:36:49,780 --> 01:36:52,140
Then, ask any girl known
to us to introduce him to her

1772
01:36:52,180 --> 01:36:53,060
Okay, brother

1773
01:36:53,100 --> 01:36:56,060
- Will you do this job, perfectly?
- I'll do this perfectly

1774
01:36:56,100 --> 01:36:57,460
If you finish it properly,

1775
01:36:57,500 --> 01:36:59,740
I'll give you ten lakhs
from the commission I get

1776
01:36:59,780 --> 01:37:00,260
Is it okay?

1777
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:01,740
- Hey!
- I'll do it, brother

1778
01:37:04,020 --> 01:37:05,260
- Saravanan!
- Brother

1779
01:37:05,300 --> 01:37:08,420
That girl who looks beauteous
is vathiyar's daughter

1780
01:37:08,460 --> 01:37:12,220
Show her love and affection
that she couldn't live without you

1781
01:37:12,460 --> 01:37:14,020
Take this iPhone

1782
01:37:14,060 --> 01:37:16,700
Two of her classmates
will introduce you to her

1783
01:37:18,340 --> 01:37:20,940
Take this chain
Wear it

1784
01:37:21,100 --> 01:37:24,860
Finish her if possible
Show all your magic

1785
01:37:28,260 --> 01:37:30,780
Why are you late?
I'm waiting for a long time

1786
01:37:30,820 --> 01:37:34,580
Leave it, it's the routine time
He is my friend, Saravanan

1787
01:37:34,620 --> 01:37:35,740
He is from Chennai

1788
01:37:36,020 --> 01:37:38,940
He is doing MSW final year
at Loyola college

1789
01:37:38,980 --> 01:37:42,660
He is asking help regarding his project
Please, help him

1790
01:37:42,700 --> 01:37:46,180
You're the same batch of mine
What help can I do for him?

1791
01:37:46,220 --> 01:37:48,700
No, known that your father
is a big shot in your hometown

1792
01:37:48,740 --> 01:37:51,620
I want to submit a project
on Naxalites

1793
01:37:52,540 --> 01:37:53,620
Like...

1794
01:37:55,460 --> 01:37:57,980
will you get me details
of these militants?

1795
01:37:58,420 --> 01:37:59,660
Okay, come tomorrow
I'll ask him and tell you

1796
01:37:59,700 --> 01:38:00,740
Okay, thank you

1797
01:38:03,820 --> 01:38:05,940
- Did you ask your father?
- Yes, I inquired him

1798
01:38:05,980 --> 01:38:07,580
I'll give the details,
you go and talk

1799
01:38:07,620 --> 01:38:10,300
Oh, no! How can I go alone?
What to ask them?

1800
01:38:10,340 --> 01:38:11,780
It'll be good, if you also
come along with me

1801
01:38:11,820 --> 01:38:13,580
Help him,
Else he might get scoldings

1802
01:38:13,620 --> 01:38:15,380
- Come, let's go on bike
- No, I'll come by walk

1803
01:38:15,420 --> 01:38:16,900
- Come by bike
- No, it's okay

1804
01:38:16,940 --> 01:38:18,420
Damn it

1805
01:38:18,460 --> 01:38:20,260
- Hey, you go
- Bye

1806
01:39:06,060 --> 01:39:07,380
- Greetings, brother
- Welcome, Karuna

1807
01:39:07,420 --> 01:39:09,900
Valavan, stay out for some time
Be seated, Karuna

1808
01:39:10,220 --> 01:39:11,340
Greetings, brother

1809
01:39:11,500 --> 01:39:14,020
How about Vathiyar's daughter?
Is she getting along?

1810
01:39:14,060 --> 01:39:16,780
She is very strong
Nothing happened favourably to us

1811
01:39:17,180 --> 01:39:20,940
You could have caressed her
and impregnated, couldn't you?

1812
01:39:20,980 --> 01:39:25,180
She isn't allowing me to touch
Her sister had trained her well

1813
01:39:25,220 --> 01:39:26,660
Karuna, what shall we do?

1814
01:39:26,700 --> 01:39:28,780
The time given by the cola company
is getting lapsed

1815
01:39:28,820 --> 01:39:31,460
Better, we will prepare a document
and do the registration

1816
01:39:31,900 --> 01:39:33,740
The Registrar at Royapuram, Chennai
is our clan

1817
01:39:33,780 --> 01:39:35,260
Excellent, Karuna
Do that

1818
01:39:35,300 --> 01:39:36,260
Brother, do one thing

1819
01:39:36,340 --> 01:39:38,980
Somehow, make that girl to sit
with you in the theatre for three hours

1820
01:39:39,020 --> 01:39:41,140
We will spread rumour
with Arumugam

1821
01:39:41,180 --> 01:39:42,620
Then, everything will happen
on it's own

1822
01:39:42,660 --> 01:39:43,900
- Okay, sir
- Understand?

1823
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:47,700
Lakshmi, we aren't going
to college today

1824
01:39:47,740 --> 01:39:48,780
You too come with us
Let's go to the movie

1825
01:39:48,820 --> 01:39:50,660
I'm not coming
I've project work

1826
01:39:50,740 --> 01:39:52,900
If you don't come,
we will get caught

1827
01:39:52,940 --> 01:39:54,540
What?

1828
01:39:54,580 --> 01:39:56,740
Won't you do this for us?
Please

1829
01:39:56,780 --> 01:39:58,780
- Come, please
- Okay, come

1830
01:40:00,140 --> 01:40:01,460
- Hi!
- Hi

1831
01:40:02,940 --> 01:40:04,260
Switch off the phone

1832
01:40:04,300 --> 01:40:06,180
If someone calls from the house

1833
01:40:06,220 --> 01:40:07,500
Good, you said us

1834
01:40:08,340 --> 01:40:09,260
Let's go

1835
01:40:09,580 --> 01:40:10,300
Come

1836
01:40:11,740 --> 01:40:15,060
- Do you know to whistle?
- I'll do

1837
01:40:21,460 --> 01:40:25,980
Son-in-law, why are you panicked?
-Has your daughter left to college?

1838
01:40:26,300 --> 01:40:28,580
She left to college in the morning
What's the matter?

1839
01:40:28,620 --> 01:40:30,380
- Tell him
- You Tell him, brother

1840
01:40:31,780 --> 01:40:36,460
That is, your daughter got
register marriage

1841
01:40:36,660 --> 01:40:39,700
with some guy and eloped

1842
01:40:39,780 --> 01:40:41,420
Hey!
I didn't believe

1843
01:40:41,460 --> 01:40:43,860
But, I should tell you a word, isn't it?

1844
01:40:43,900 --> 01:40:45,940
My daughter is like pure gold

1845
01:40:45,980 --> 01:40:48,100
Draupathi didn't bring her up like that

1846
01:40:48,140 --> 01:40:49,700
Go and look after your job, dude

1847
01:40:50,540 --> 01:40:51,660
Show that

1848
01:40:51,740 --> 01:40:52,900
Give me

1849
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:56,060
Uncle, look at this

1850
01:40:56,820 --> 01:40:57,740
Look at this

1851
01:40:57,940 --> 01:40:59,700
- Who is this, dude?
- Look, it's him

1852
01:41:00,660 --> 01:41:04,220
It's said, she has eloped with him

1853
01:41:04,620 --> 01:41:06,220
Call your daughter, uncle

1854
01:41:06,500 --> 01:41:08,340
I don't understand anything

1855
01:41:14,900 --> 01:41:18,580
- Can't you reach her?
- Uncle, call Draupathi

1856
01:41:35,620 --> 01:41:38,780
What happened, uncle?
You called me urgently

1857
01:41:40,340 --> 01:41:42,140
Why are you panicked?

1858
01:41:43,100 --> 01:41:45,060
- Draupathi!
- Tell me, Uncle

1859
01:41:45,420 --> 01:41:46,900
- That is...
- Tell her, Uncle

1860
01:41:49,740 --> 01:41:51,780
Brother-in-law, at least you tell me
what happened

1861
01:41:51,820 --> 01:41:54,580
No
Look at this!

1862
01:41:58,540 --> 01:42:02,260
It's said, Lakshmi had
register marriage with someone,

1863
01:42:02,300 --> 01:42:03,980
and fleed the town

1864
01:42:06,100 --> 01:42:09,340
When called her,
the phone is switched off

1865
01:42:09,500 --> 01:42:14,860
Uncle, Lakshmi will switch off
her phone usually when in college

1866
01:42:16,580 --> 01:42:19,380
Uncle, that's nothing
It might be a photo taken just

1867
01:42:19,420 --> 01:42:22,140
I've seen Lakshmi going with
that guy on bike

1868
01:42:22,180 --> 01:42:23,980
You don't fear, uncle
Just wait

1869
01:42:24,020 --> 01:42:25,780
I'll make a call to the college
and inquire

1870
01:42:31,060 --> 01:42:34,100
Uncle, when Thilaga had a
issue with love,

1871
01:42:34,140 --> 01:42:36,580
Lakshmi conveyed me
and asked to solve it

1872
01:42:37,820 --> 01:42:41,900
Lakshmi wouldn't have done that
You don't worry about her

1873
01:42:41,940 --> 01:42:43,540
I know well about her

1874
01:42:43,820 --> 01:42:48,820
Draupathi, Lakshmi is not in the college
Even her friends didn't come

1875
01:42:48,860 --> 01:42:52,020
It might be some other issue
Wait, I'll call her friends and ask

1876
01:42:54,700 --> 01:42:58,300
- Uncle, first you sit without panic
- Uncle, sit down

1877
01:42:58,340 --> 01:43:00,260
- Sit down, Uncle
- Sit down

1878
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:03,180
From Kannadasan to Kalaignar

1879
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:05,460
We brought them here
and taught studies

1880
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:07,340
But you are bad in studies

1881
01:43:07,380 --> 01:43:08,580
Listen to me

1882
01:43:15,060 --> 01:43:17,100
The ring is going on
But, they aren't attending

1883
01:43:20,300 --> 01:43:21,620
Brother, it's true

1884
01:43:21,660 --> 01:43:24,060
The marriage registration document
has been sent

1885
01:43:24,100 --> 01:43:27,580
She cheated us and eloped, brother
Look at this, brother

1886
01:43:45,300 --> 01:43:46,580
It's all in your hands

1887
01:43:46,620 --> 01:43:49,260
Doesn't matter how I called you
I didn't like this post

1888
01:43:49,300 --> 01:43:52,260
He is the head honcho of this village
But, his daughter had humiliated him

1889
01:43:52,300 --> 01:43:55,900
Who will heed him, henceforth?
It's really sad

1890
01:43:58,100 --> 01:43:59,980
He lived with great honour

1891
01:44:00,020 --> 01:44:02,980
His daughter has ruined
everything in a day

1892
01:44:05,700 --> 01:44:07,700
Uncle, sit down

1893
01:44:08,780 --> 01:44:12,060
- Where are you going?
- I'll go to the farm

1894
01:44:12,380 --> 01:44:13,740
Okay, go along with him

1895
01:44:13,780 --> 01:44:14,980
- Dear!
- I'll take care

1896
01:44:48,300 --> 01:44:49,260
Uncle!

1897
01:44:50,700 --> 01:44:52,140
I am coming

1898
01:45:33,260 --> 01:45:36,140
Hey, hereafter don't bunk the college

1899
01:45:40,220 --> 01:45:43,020
Hey, send the guys to check
at Mayilam, Koot road

1900
01:45:45,780 --> 01:45:49,100
- Sister, Lakshmi has come
- Has Lakshmi arrived?

1901
01:45:50,380 --> 01:45:52,380
Where did you go,
switching off your phone?

1902
01:45:52,420 --> 01:45:53,820
I went for movie along
with my friends, sister

1903
01:45:53,860 --> 01:45:55,500
Okay, take her to uncle

1904
01:45:55,540 --> 01:45:57,260
Why, what happened, sister?

1905
01:45:57,500 --> 01:45:59,020
Okay, speak to your father first

1906
01:45:59,060 --> 01:46:01,540
Dad!
What happened?

1907
01:46:02,300 --> 01:46:05,140
Sorry, dad! I went for
movie with my friends

1908
01:46:05,180 --> 01:46:06,940
Dad! Speak to me

1909
01:46:07,020 --> 01:46:08,380
Dad, look at me

1910
01:46:08,420 --> 01:46:10,260
Uncle, sister has come

1911
01:46:11,340 --> 01:46:12,540
Dad!

1912
01:46:12,580 --> 01:46:13,820
- Oh, no!
- Dad!

1913
01:46:13,860 --> 01:46:16,420
What happened?

1914
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:19,100
Look here, dad!

1915
01:46:19,380 --> 01:46:22,660
- Lakshmi has come, uncle
- See her, Uncle

1916
01:46:22,900 --> 01:46:24,420
Uncle!

1917
01:46:24,620 --> 01:46:26,700
Get up, dad

1918
01:46:27,020 --> 01:46:29,580
Dad, get up

1919
01:46:31,140 --> 01:46:34,380
Look at me dad

1920
01:46:34,780 --> 01:46:38,300
Damn it
We took wrong decision

1921
01:46:38,380 --> 01:46:40,660
Dad!
What happened?

1922
01:46:40,700 --> 01:46:43,460
Dad!
Get up, dad

1923
01:46:45,100 --> 01:46:47,660
You did a murder
without knife and blood

1924
01:46:47,700 --> 01:46:49,380
You know it's a fake marriage

1925
01:46:49,420 --> 01:46:51,380
Then, how did they file a case
on you as 'honour killing'?

1926
01:46:51,420 --> 01:46:54,820
Myself and Draupathi have witnessed
him going with Lakshmi on bike

1927
01:46:54,860 --> 01:46:59,140
We don't know whether Lakshmi
is telling us about him the truth or not

1928
01:46:59,260 --> 01:47:01,980
We couldn't even ask her
about this in that situation

1929
01:47:02,020 --> 01:47:05,820
Only then, the locale Police Inspector
came home with them

1930
01:47:13,100 --> 01:47:14,460
Go and call Prabhakar

1931
01:47:16,700 --> 01:47:18,060
Tel me, sir

1932
01:47:18,260 --> 01:47:22,780
Two days ago, Damador's
daughter got married to other caste guy,

1933
01:47:22,860 --> 01:47:25,420
so, disheartened by that
he has committed suicide

1934
01:47:25,460 --> 01:47:28,260
We got a complaint that
you hid it and trying to get

1935
01:47:28,300 --> 01:47:32,220
his daughter married to
someone in hurry

1936
01:47:32,260 --> 01:47:33,700
Who lodged the complaint?

1937
01:47:33,740 --> 01:47:37,460
Saravanan, who married Lakshmi lodged
this complaint along with his advocate

1938
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:38,660
Look, Prabhakar

1939
01:47:38,700 --> 01:47:42,620
If you do her another marriage,
I'll arrest you

1940
01:47:42,660 --> 01:47:43,580
Be careful

1941
01:47:43,620 --> 01:47:46,140
Sir, this is a forgery marriage

1942
01:47:46,180 --> 01:47:48,380
They got the documents
of our girl and

1943
01:47:48,420 --> 01:47:49,980
have done this register marriage

1944
01:47:50,020 --> 01:47:53,380
You're threatening us
heeding to them

1945
01:47:53,420 --> 01:47:56,300
I'll lodge a complaint
First, take action on them

1946
01:47:56,340 --> 01:47:57,260
Is it?

1947
01:47:57,340 --> 01:47:59,860
Okay, I brought the complainant

1948
01:47:59,900 --> 01:48:00,860
I'll send them now

1949
01:48:00,900 --> 01:48:03,300
Talk with them and
try to compromise

1950
01:48:03,340 --> 01:48:04,580
Hope you can understand

1951
01:48:04,620 --> 01:48:06,700
Else, you said you'd lodge
a complaint

1952
01:48:06,780 --> 01:48:08,580
Give the complaint
I'll take action

1953
01:48:08,620 --> 01:48:09,700
What's this, dear?

1954
01:48:11,980 --> 01:48:12,900
Mam!

1955
01:48:12,940 --> 01:48:16,540
The inspector is not good
They all belong to the same clan

1956
01:48:16,580 --> 01:48:19,420
If you want justice,
it's right to approach the court

1957
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:21,020
Take care, mam
I'll leave

1958
01:48:25,580 --> 01:48:27,980
How are they related to this?
Why have they come here?

1959
01:48:28,060 --> 01:48:29,700
No need to get confused

1960
01:48:29,740 --> 01:48:33,580
The guy who married your girl
is under my protection, feared of you

1961
01:48:33,660 --> 01:48:35,820
He will listen to what I say

1962
01:48:35,860 --> 01:48:39,380
I'm enraged
I'll lynch everyone into pieces

1963
01:48:39,460 --> 01:48:40,380
Do it

1964
01:48:41,140 --> 01:48:43,580
Whatever you do
will turn favourable to us

1965
01:48:43,620 --> 01:48:45,140
Do that
Come on

1966
01:48:45,180 --> 01:48:47,260
Dear, be calm

1967
01:48:48,460 --> 01:48:50,340
I know what's in their mind

1968
01:48:50,420 --> 01:48:53,180
- What do you expect from us?
- Good, You understood

1969
01:48:53,220 --> 01:48:54,580
I'm happy

1970
01:48:54,860 --> 01:48:57,420
A foreigner is going to start
a soft drinks company here

1971
01:48:57,460 --> 01:48:59,660
So, you've to get me
the lands I show you

1972
01:48:59,700 --> 01:49:01,700
For that sake,
we have done all these

1973
01:49:01,740 --> 01:49:02,900
Tell me, if it's okay

1974
01:49:02,940 --> 01:49:04,540
I'll get signature from Saravanan
now itself

1975
01:49:04,580 --> 01:49:05,860
You rescue your sister's life

1976
01:49:05,900 --> 01:49:08,060
Who are you to decide my life?

1977
01:49:08,180 --> 01:49:12,420
To earn money, they made me
as a tool and killed our father

1978
01:49:12,460 --> 01:49:14,460
Saravanan also belongs to their clan

1979
01:49:14,500 --> 01:49:16,060
It's okay even if my life
gets spoiled

1980
01:49:16,100 --> 01:49:17,220
They shouldn't be spared

1981
01:49:17,260 --> 01:49:19,900
Listened to her?
Listen to me, now

1982
01:49:20,260 --> 01:49:22,500
Both the land and woman
are important for us

1983
01:49:22,540 --> 01:49:25,220
Whoever lays hand on them
will be lynched

1984
01:49:25,300 --> 01:49:26,860
What are you thinking about?

1985
01:49:26,900 --> 01:49:31,500
For scurrilous people like you
who use woman to earn money and land,

1986
01:49:31,540 --> 01:49:36,340
I'll use my sister's issue as a tool
and get you punishment in the court

1987
01:49:38,300 --> 01:49:40,620
I swear on the child
in my womb

1988
01:49:40,660 --> 01:49:42,780
Do whatever you can

1989
01:49:42,820 --> 01:49:44,980
Leave from here

1990
01:49:45,020 --> 01:49:46,780
Dear, ask them to leave

1991
01:49:46,820 --> 01:49:49,340
She said, isn't it?
Get lost

1992
01:49:49,820 --> 01:49:51,900
- You go inside
- Come

1993
01:49:54,620 --> 01:49:55,460
Call him

1994
01:49:55,540 --> 01:49:56,860
Ask him to come to bus stop

1995
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:00,820
Hello!
Who is this?

1996
01:50:00,860 --> 01:50:02,300
Brother, I'm Saravanan speaking

1997
01:50:02,420 --> 01:50:03,300
Saravanan?

1998
01:50:03,340 --> 01:50:06,300
It's me who married Lakshmi

1999
01:50:06,340 --> 01:50:07,220
Who's that?

2000
01:50:07,260 --> 01:50:08,100
What do you want?

2001
01:50:08,140 --> 01:50:09,740
Please rescue me, brother

2002
01:50:09,780 --> 01:50:14,300
Both of them are planning to kill me
and put the blame on you

2003
01:50:14,340 --> 01:50:15,780
Somehow, rescue me

2004
01:50:15,820 --> 01:50:18,380
I'll tell all the facts to the police
I'm sorry, brother

2005
01:50:18,500 --> 01:50:21,180
- Okay, where are you now?
- I'm at bus stop

2006
01:50:21,220 --> 01:50:22,020
Please, come soon

2007
01:50:22,060 --> 01:50:23,300
Okay, be there
I'll come

2008
01:50:23,580 --> 01:50:25,100
Come, brother

2009
01:50:25,140 --> 01:50:29,660
That guy Saravanan
They have decided to kill him also

2010
01:50:30,620 --> 01:50:32,700
Feared, he says he will turn
as an approver

2011
01:50:32,780 --> 01:50:35,540
I'll go to bus stop
Take care of Lakshmi

2012
01:50:35,580 --> 01:50:38,300
Dear, don't go
I feel something fishy

2013
01:50:38,380 --> 01:50:40,060
Whatever, we will see

2014
01:50:40,100 --> 01:50:41,860
Who is dare enough to touch me?

2015
01:50:41,900 --> 01:50:43,500
I'll take care
You be safe

2016
01:50:49,340 --> 01:50:51,700
Have a glass of milk and sleep

2017
01:50:51,740 --> 01:50:54,020
- Close the door
- Okay, come soon, dear

2018
01:51:17,780 --> 01:51:21,820
His phone is switched off
He told me to come to bus stop

2019
01:51:21,900 --> 01:51:25,420
He said there is some problem
But, he isn't seen here

2020
01:51:26,420 --> 01:51:29,380
Dear, don't go
I feel something fishy

2021
01:51:49,780 --> 01:51:50,820
Dear!

2022
01:51:51,180 --> 01:51:53,060
Oh, no!

2023
01:52:03,500 --> 01:52:06,780
Oh, dear!

2024
01:52:07,580 --> 01:52:14,300
You told me not to go
Oh, no!

2025
01:52:25,460 --> 01:52:29,180
That was when I last saw
Lakshmi and Draupathi

2026
01:52:29,900 --> 01:52:32,220
Both were lying in pool of blood

2027
01:52:35,980 --> 01:52:40,700
They did the murder, filed a fake case
on me as I did 'honour killing'

2028
01:52:40,740 --> 01:52:42,340
and sent me to prison

2029
01:52:48,220 --> 01:52:49,260
What happened next?

2030
01:52:49,300 --> 01:52:52,500
I heard the village people
had buried Lakshmi

2031
01:52:52,700 --> 01:52:57,700
And donated Draupathi's body
to the the medical college as she wished

2032
01:52:57,740 --> 01:52:59,500
It's very clear that
you did this murder

2033
01:52:59,540 --> 01:53:03,380
Tell me who killed
Draupathi and Lakshmi?

2034
01:53:04,180 --> 01:53:05,540
I'm just a scapegoat

2035
01:53:05,620 --> 01:53:09,580
They threatened me to call him
and tell him to come to the bus stop

2036
01:53:09,620 --> 01:53:12,100
I called him and made him
to come to bus stop

2037
01:53:12,700 --> 01:53:14,220
Please come, brother

2038
01:53:14,580 --> 01:53:16,820
Look, we both are going
to intrude into the house

2039
01:53:16,860 --> 01:53:18,140
He'd have gone to bus stop
in search of you

2040
01:53:18,180 --> 01:53:19,940
If he knows you aren't there,
definitely he will come back

2041
01:53:19,980 --> 01:53:21,420
Call us when he arrives

2042
01:53:21,460 --> 01:53:22,300
- Okay?
- Okay, brother

2043
01:53:22,340 --> 01:53:24,620
Hey, don't be in his vicinity
until he comes

2044
01:53:24,660 --> 01:53:26,220
- Switch off the phone
- Okay, brother

2045
01:53:26,260 --> 01:53:27,660
- Throw away the SIM card
- Okay

2046
01:53:39,700 --> 01:53:40,740
Who is that?

2047
01:53:42,700 --> 01:53:44,060
Brother, go inside
Go inside

2048
01:53:44,100 --> 01:53:45,660
Who's that at this time?

2049
01:53:50,660 --> 01:53:51,940
Who is that?

2050
01:53:53,340 --> 01:53:55,020
No one is seen

2051
01:53:58,580 --> 01:54:00,100
Who's that at this time?

2052
01:54:19,140 --> 01:54:20,220
Slowly

2053
01:54:20,260 --> 01:54:22,860
Don't raise your voice

2054
01:54:22,900 --> 01:54:24,180
Sister!

2055
01:54:26,060 --> 01:54:27,860
Slit her throat

2056
01:54:27,940 --> 01:54:30,340
Slit her throat

2057
01:54:30,380 --> 01:54:32,380
Do it, brother

2058
01:54:33,540 --> 01:54:35,300
It's over
Come, brother

2059
01:54:35,620 --> 01:54:36,980
Let her come

2060
01:55:05,740 --> 01:55:08,660
Lakshmi!

2061
01:55:09,860 --> 01:55:13,260
Lakshmi, what happened?

2062
01:55:14,780 --> 01:55:16,380
Hey!

2063
01:55:46,660 --> 01:55:48,900
Come, let's go

2064
01:56:03,540 --> 01:56:04,340
Dear!

2065
01:56:04,980 --> 01:56:06,940
Oh, no!

2066
01:56:28,100 --> 01:56:30,220
I did for the sake of money

2067
01:56:30,820 --> 01:56:34,500
If I don't do this, they said they will kill me
and throw me on the railway track

2068
01:56:34,540 --> 01:56:36,500
and put the blame on him

2069
01:56:36,540 --> 01:56:39,020
I don't know any other way
That's why, I did so

2070
01:56:42,220 --> 01:56:44,980
Sorry, Prabhakar
I troubled you more

2071
01:56:45,060 --> 01:56:47,060
There is nothing wrong to kill them

2072
01:56:47,300 --> 01:56:50,060
- Anbu
- Yes, tell me, sir

2073
01:56:50,220 --> 01:56:53,420
What you've recorded now,
copy it in a hard disk and give to me

2074
01:56:53,540 --> 01:56:56,060
Both of you hand him over
to the Villupuram court

2075
01:56:56,100 --> 01:56:57,100
Yes, sir

2076
01:56:57,700 --> 01:56:59,980
Prabhakar, let's go
to see your wife

2077
01:57:00,660 --> 01:57:03,900
Tell your friend to bring
the original certificates

2078
01:57:07,100 --> 01:57:09,740
I'm getting pressure from the Minister
That's why, I came in person

2079
01:57:09,820 --> 01:57:12,980
- Did you get the original certificates?
- Sir, the report will arrive in an hour

2080
01:57:13,020 --> 01:57:15,140
Will prepare the report as you said
and send to the court

2081
01:57:15,180 --> 01:57:17,420
Look here, when you get
the original marriage certificate,

2082
01:57:17,460 --> 01:57:18,540
Send it to my cabin

2083
01:57:18,580 --> 01:57:21,540
- I'll prepare a report and send it
- Because, this case won't withstand

2084
01:57:21,580 --> 01:57:24,420
If you send that certificate to the court,
there are chances of amending a new law

2085
01:57:24,460 --> 01:57:27,020
A big caste riots will occur
Just do what I say

2086
01:57:27,060 --> 01:57:29,340
Get the certificate to my office
as soon as you get it

2087
01:57:29,380 --> 01:57:30,340
Okay, sir

2088
01:58:37,420 --> 01:58:39,740
Dear!

2089
01:59:04,220 --> 01:59:07,140
- How it's possible, doctor?
- The child is in good health condition

2090
01:59:07,220 --> 01:59:10,260
I'll do surgery on day after tomorrow
and take the baby out

2091
01:59:10,300 --> 01:59:11,740
How it's possible for Draupathi?

2092
01:59:11,780 --> 01:59:13,700
No one has revealed anything
about Draupathi to me

2093
01:59:13,740 --> 01:59:16,100
You say, it's a brain dead case
Then, how did you save her?

2094
01:59:16,140 --> 01:59:20,060
- I've submitted the report as 'brain dead'
- Prabhakaran knows me well

2095
01:59:20,100 --> 01:59:22,260
I'm the Dean of
Villupuram Government hospital

2096
01:59:22,660 --> 01:59:24,780
What happened on that day

2097
01:59:25,260 --> 01:59:27,940
Doctor, they are a big network
that does blackmail

2098
01:59:27,980 --> 01:59:31,140
With women as a tool, they can do
whatever they want

2099
01:59:31,420 --> 01:59:34,380
The mob that ruined my sister's life,

2100
01:59:34,420 --> 01:59:37,780
I'll show them the end
before my child is born

2101
01:59:37,860 --> 01:59:41,060
- This is Draupathi's vow!
- You do it for sure

2102
01:59:41,100 --> 01:59:43,540
I'll also be with you
to win your vow

2103
01:59:43,580 --> 01:59:46,500
File the writ in
Chennai high court, tomorrow

2104
01:59:46,700 --> 01:59:49,340
Rania will be with you
and guide you in everything

2105
01:59:49,380 --> 01:59:51,780
- I'll inform her now itself
- Okay, doctor

2106
01:59:51,820 --> 01:59:53,180
Thank you very much, doctor

2107
01:59:55,300 --> 02:00:00,020
In an hour when she called me,
I got a call from the hospital

2108
02:00:00,060 --> 02:00:01,780
I can't believe that

2109
02:00:02,180 --> 02:00:06,780
Draupathi was admitted at
our hospital in coma stage

2110
02:00:07,260 --> 02:00:12,300
When I saw the FIR, it was revealed,
Prabhakar was the reason for her stance

2111
02:00:12,340 --> 02:00:14,460
But, I know that's not the fact

2112
02:00:14,500 --> 02:00:19,220
I understood well that someone else
had tried to kill her

2113
02:00:19,260 --> 02:00:22,060
She is not just one life
but two lives

2114
02:00:22,100 --> 02:00:25,220
So, I spoke to the
Government higher officials,

2115
02:00:25,260 --> 02:00:27,300
and made them to understand
the situation

2116
02:00:28,940 --> 02:00:31,860
On my own risk, I submitted
a report on her as 'brain dead'

2117
02:00:31,900 --> 02:00:33,500
And shifted her to Chennai

2118
02:00:33,540 --> 02:00:35,980
and taking care of her here,
not revealing to anyone

2119
02:00:37,980 --> 02:00:40,820
Myself and the Doctor
tried twice to meet you

2120
02:00:40,860 --> 02:00:43,940
But, you avoided us
not to meet in prison

2121
02:00:44,940 --> 02:00:46,820
When you come out of bail,

2122
02:00:46,860 --> 02:00:49,620
I told your advocate
to inform you to meet me

2123
02:00:50,860 --> 02:00:53,420
That's my fault
Forgive me, Doctor

2124
02:00:53,460 --> 02:00:56,140
Don't worry, Prabhakar
Everything will be good

2125
02:00:57,420 --> 02:00:59,420
Dude, after all these issues,

2126
02:00:59,460 --> 02:01:02,100
the reason still my sister is alive
is because of her good deeds

2127
02:01:03,500 --> 02:01:07,100
If my wife is still alive,
her intention was strong

2128
02:01:07,140 --> 02:01:09,100
This is the original certificate
you asked for

2129
02:01:09,580 --> 02:01:12,220
Her vow must win
and as well as this case

2130
02:01:12,260 --> 02:01:13,540
I'll do my best

2131
02:01:13,580 --> 02:01:16,380
You shouldn't go out of this hospital
Still, you're under arrest

2132
02:01:16,420 --> 02:01:18,460
- So, please co-operate
- Definitely

2133
02:01:18,940 --> 02:01:19,980
I'm leaving

2134
02:01:25,500 --> 02:01:28,900
Sir, this is the original certificate
of the fake marriage I got from Prabhakar

2135
02:01:28,940 --> 02:01:30,900
This is the video footage
of LIVE enquiry I did

2136
02:01:32,700 --> 02:01:35,900
If we submit both these to the court,
definitely it'll create an awareness nationwide

2137
02:01:35,940 --> 02:01:37,660
This case will definitely be dissolved

2138
02:01:37,700 --> 02:01:40,660
As per the instructions of top officials,
this case cannot be won

2139
02:01:40,700 --> 02:01:42,980
Until the 'caste politics' exists here,

2140
02:01:43,020 --> 02:01:46,660
Nothing good happens to people
and we can't do anything good

2141
02:01:46,700 --> 02:01:52,020
At Poonamalle, a tea-seller on the road
had raped and murdered a four year old girl

2142
02:01:52,060 --> 02:01:54,140
Now, he got bail and roaming freely

2143
02:01:54,180 --> 02:01:57,180
Kill him on encounter
and save Prabhakaran, Arun

2144
02:01:57,220 --> 02:01:58,700
Sir, what's this?
You're saying just like that

2145
02:01:58,740 --> 02:02:00,420
I've done a lot of ground work

2146
02:02:00,460 --> 02:02:02,300
Don't leave this fake marriage case
go easily

2147
02:02:02,340 --> 02:02:04,900
Many girls were affected because of this
Sir, please do something

2148
02:02:04,940 --> 02:02:06,420
The truth can never be hidden

2149
02:02:06,460 --> 02:02:09,300
Definitely, someone related to this case
will get trapped, someday

2150
02:02:09,340 --> 02:02:10,420
Let's see on that day

2151
02:02:10,460 --> 02:02:12,220
Now, you can relieve
from this case

2152
02:02:12,260 --> 02:02:14,860
If there is any other similar case,
I'll call you

2153
02:02:15,420 --> 02:02:16,300
Okay, sir

2154
02:02:18,540 --> 02:02:20,580
MrGurudev, have you read
the police report?

2155
02:02:20,620 --> 02:02:21,780
Yes, your honour

2156
02:02:21,980 --> 02:02:25,660
To express somebody's frustration
that happened in his life,

2157
02:02:25,820 --> 02:02:31,820
That no one should do register marriages,
he made the Sub-registrar to talk like this

2158
02:02:32,060 --> 02:02:35,900
It's said that nothing is
registered in the record

2159
02:02:35,940 --> 02:02:37,180
Do you've evidence?

2160
02:02:37,220 --> 02:02:41,180
My request is to call the Sub-registrar
and you inquire him in person

2161
02:02:41,220 --> 02:02:45,260
and take a good decision, my lord

2162
02:02:45,460 --> 02:02:47,140
Request is accepted

2163
02:02:47,580 --> 02:02:53,060
I order the Police department to
produce the Sub-registrar, Neela narayanan

2164
02:02:53,140 --> 02:02:55,420
tomorrow in the court

2165
02:02:55,460 --> 02:02:56,740
Thank you, my lordship

2166
02:03:02,860 --> 02:03:03,780
Come, sir

2167
02:03:03,860 --> 02:03:05,300
Why have you come here?

2168
02:03:05,460 --> 02:03:07,220
Nothing is there to get from me

2169
02:03:07,260 --> 02:03:10,220
No, Prabhakar
I can't do anything

2170
02:03:10,260 --> 02:03:13,020
I knew six months ago
that the Police couldn't do anything

2171
02:03:13,380 --> 02:03:16,420
But still I say,
my wife's vow will win

2172
02:03:16,460 --> 02:03:21,660
- No one can hinder that
- I trusted you more

2173
02:03:21,700 --> 02:03:24,180
Didn't you submit
the marriage certificate?

2174
02:03:24,220 --> 02:03:25,300
I've submitted it

2175
02:03:25,340 --> 02:03:27,900
But the Assistant commissioner
said he can't do anything

2176
02:03:27,940 --> 02:03:31,100
Problem with higher officials,
law and order, something he says

2177
02:03:32,380 --> 02:03:34,020
But, all your proofs
are with me, Prabhakar

2178
02:03:34,060 --> 02:03:36,500
If I get the marriage certificate,
I can save you, definitely

2179
02:03:37,060 --> 02:03:39,260
Even it's okay, if I lose the job
I'll face it

2180
02:03:42,060 --> 02:03:44,020
I asked advocate Gurudevan sir
to come

2181
02:03:44,060 --> 02:03:45,660
If he decides
he can change this case

2182
02:03:46,740 --> 02:03:49,540
Arun from CCP department?

2183
02:03:49,580 --> 02:03:51,340
Greetings, sir!
It's me, sir

2184
02:03:51,380 --> 02:03:52,220
Greetings!

2185
02:03:53,100 --> 02:03:55,100
What happened?
Why did you call me urgently?

2186
02:03:55,140 --> 02:03:56,220
Sir, that is

2187
02:03:56,260 --> 02:03:58,180
Whatever, tell me without hesitation

2188
02:03:58,220 --> 02:03:59,420
He is Mr.Prabhakaran

2189
02:03:59,460 --> 02:04:01,100
The murderer related to your case

2190
02:04:02,340 --> 02:04:03,580
- Is he?
- Yes, sir

2191
02:04:04,580 --> 02:04:06,580
Excellent, brother

2192
02:04:06,620 --> 02:04:09,260
People who are scurrilous
should be killed like this

2193
02:04:09,300 --> 02:04:10,580
You don't worry
about anything

2194
02:04:10,620 --> 02:04:12,220
I'll appear on your behalf

2195
02:04:12,260 --> 02:04:15,020
That gang is in fear now

2196
02:04:15,060 --> 02:04:18,620
Because of those clan,
even the good people are suffering

2197
02:04:18,660 --> 02:04:20,580
Sir, give me the original
marriage certificate

2198
02:04:20,620 --> 02:04:21,860
I'll handle the rest of the things
in the court

2199
02:04:21,900 --> 02:04:22,980
Don't worry, brother

2200
02:04:23,020 --> 02:04:26,180
Sir, the original marriage certificate
is not with us now

2201
02:04:26,220 --> 02:04:29,100
Before that, I need to tell you
an important matter about her

2202
02:04:29,140 --> 02:04:30,740
She is Draupathi

2203
02:04:46,260 --> 02:04:48,860
Sir, now you've to tell me
what should we do?

2204
02:04:58,460 --> 02:05:00,500
If this incident has happened
to someone,

2205
02:05:00,540 --> 02:05:02,580
they will look after their problems

2206
02:05:02,900 --> 02:05:06,500
But for the sake of all the girls,
you've taken this risk

2207
02:05:06,540 --> 02:05:08,500
Really, you're great

2208
02:05:09,620 --> 02:05:11,540
I want to eradicate these clans
from the grassroots

2209
02:05:11,580 --> 02:05:13,220
But the law is suppressed

2210
02:05:13,260 --> 02:05:15,300
The law is favourable to them.

2211
02:05:15,700 --> 02:05:20,340
If we want to win, we have to post
the atrocities happened to them

2212
02:05:20,380 --> 02:05:24,660
in the media and reveal
the world by tonight

2213
02:05:24,700 --> 02:05:26,620
Let's think how to implement it

2214
02:05:26,780 --> 02:05:29,620
We have taken a documentary
Shall we release it?

2215
02:05:29,660 --> 02:05:30,980
What documentary is it?
What is it about?

2216
02:05:31,020 --> 02:05:34,220
We have done a documentary on
how Draupathi and Lakshmi were affected,

2217
02:05:34,260 --> 02:05:35,900
by this fake marriage certificate

2218
02:05:35,940 --> 02:05:39,780
If it's released, there are chances
for a big revolution among the people

2219
02:05:39,820 --> 02:05:40,860
Excellent, mam

2220
02:05:40,900 --> 02:05:45,180
If a revolution is created by this
and if any of the victims of their parents,

2221
02:05:45,220 --> 02:05:47,500
approach the court,
then I'll take care of the rest

2222
02:05:47,540 --> 02:05:49,020
Release the documentary on prime time

2223
02:05:49,060 --> 02:05:51,860
We must get the judgement
by the time the child is born

2224
02:05:59,380 --> 02:06:00,740
Greetings to all!

2225
02:06:00,820 --> 02:06:02,660
Welcome to 'Urimai Kural'(Voice of rights)
programme

2226
02:06:02,700 --> 02:06:05,420
In this programme, the topic
we are going to discuss

2227
02:06:05,460 --> 02:06:08,020
is about a documentary

2228
02:06:08,060 --> 02:06:09,220
That too, it has been released on
social websites,

2229
02:06:09,260 --> 02:06:10,620
especially on You tube,

2230
02:06:10,660 --> 02:06:12,500
it has created controversies,

2231
02:06:12,540 --> 02:06:14,540
and debates equal to a big feature film

2232
02:06:14,580 --> 02:06:17,060
The title of that documentary is,
'Draupathi's vow'

2233
02:06:17,140 --> 02:06:18,420
Today, we are going to
discuss about it

2234
02:06:18,460 --> 02:06:21,500
'Draupathi'

2235
02:06:21,580 --> 02:06:25,660
The concept of the documentary which is adapted
from the real incident is very shocking

2236
02:06:25,700 --> 02:06:28,420
In Senthamangalam village,
Villupuram District,

2237
02:06:28,460 --> 02:06:32,100
A beverage company, in order to
establish their plant, visits that village

2238
02:06:32,140 --> 02:06:37,260
But, the village head is reprimanding them
and not allowing them to set the plant

2239
02:06:37,300 --> 02:06:39,540
But, they approach a 'movement'
after outsted from there

2240
02:06:39,580 --> 02:06:41,540
That 'movement' implements a plan

2241
02:06:41,580 --> 02:06:43,140
That was perceived as a shocking plan

2242
02:06:43,180 --> 02:06:48,620
They try to make the daughter
of the village head to fall in love

2243
02:06:48,660 --> 02:06:52,460
with the guy they had sent

2244
02:06:52,500 --> 02:06:55,020
When it's not happening,
as their next step

2245
02:06:55,060 --> 02:06:57,420
In the Sub-registrar office, Royapuram,

2246
02:06:57,460 --> 02:06:59,980
They conducted a fake marriage without
the presence of the girl

2247
02:07:00,020 --> 02:07:04,460
and give the marriage certificate
to the village head

2248
02:07:04,500 --> 02:07:06,660
The village head commits suicide
out of shock

2249
02:07:06,700 --> 02:07:08,780
This is the content of that film

2250
02:07:08,820 --> 02:07:10,300
An important matter of the film is,

2251
02:07:10,340 --> 02:07:12,620
the fake marriage
that happened without the girl

2252
02:07:12,660 --> 02:07:16,020
Lawyer Gurudevan, who is
bonded to controversies,

2253
02:07:16,060 --> 02:07:18,620
takes this as a public
case to the High court

2254
02:07:18,660 --> 02:07:20,380
The judgement of this case
will be given tomorrow

2255
02:07:20,420 --> 02:07:23,380
Before that, he had made two requests

2256
02:07:23,420 --> 02:07:24,780
Let's watch it now

2257
02:07:24,900 --> 02:07:29,460
If a clan is doing so many fake marriages
and sexual harassments very boldly means,

2258
02:07:29,500 --> 02:07:30,820
what would be the reason?

2259
02:07:30,860 --> 02:07:33,660
As an attempt
to prevent fake marriages,

2260
02:07:33,700 --> 02:07:37,660
You've taken a documentary,
'Draupathi's vow'

2261
02:07:37,700 --> 02:07:40,100
First, I congratulate you
and your team for that effort

2262
02:07:40,140 --> 02:07:41,100
Thank you, sir

2263
02:07:41,340 --> 02:07:46,220
According to me, many women,
either who have done register marriages

2264
02:07:46,260 --> 02:07:51,300
or sexual harassment cases,
if they need a permanent solution

2265
02:07:51,340 --> 02:07:55,060
they must come out
and speak boldly

2266
02:07:55,140 --> 02:07:57,060
Only then, we will get a solution
for these problems

2267
02:07:57,140 --> 02:07:59,020
Sir, what's the amendment that
you've requested

2268
02:07:59,060 --> 02:08:00,340
in your public interest writ?

2269
02:08:00,380 --> 02:08:04,580
The CCTV cameras must be fitted in
all the locations

2270
02:08:04,620 --> 02:08:06,580
where marriage registrations take place

2271
02:08:06,620 --> 02:08:08,180
The event should be recorded

2272
02:08:08,220 --> 02:08:11,420
That should be protected
by the Government archives

2273
02:08:11,620 --> 02:08:16,700
And this kind of marriages should happen
in the presence of parents

2274
02:08:16,740 --> 02:08:20,340
That too, when the girls are
below 21 years of age,

2275
02:08:20,380 --> 02:08:23,100
their marriage should happen
definitely in presence of her parents

2276
02:08:23,180 --> 02:08:24,780
I've put forward these two requests

2277
02:08:24,860 --> 02:08:27,620
There are many girls
who are affected like Lakshmi

2278
02:08:27,660 --> 02:08:36,020
Either the victims of their parents,
when they approach with proper evidence,

2279
02:08:36,060 --> 02:08:38,060
I believe definitely there will
be an amendment of law

2280
02:08:38,100 --> 02:08:41,260
The important message revealed by
this documentary is

2281
02:08:41,420 --> 02:08:43,540
Though we say there is no caste
or if we deny caste,

2282
02:08:43,580 --> 02:08:44,740
casteism will not be abolished

2283
02:08:44,780 --> 02:08:48,100
When said the caste exists,
we can travel in par

2284
02:08:48,140 --> 02:08:52,820
Only when we travel so, we can get rid of the
political businessmen from this society

2285
02:08:52,860 --> 02:08:55,580
It has been conveyed strongly by this film

2286
02:08:55,620 --> 02:08:58,980
The verdict to be given tomorrow
is creating an expectation

2287
02:08:59,020 --> 02:09:02,940
of the changes in the
Indian Hindu Marriage Act

2288
02:09:02,980 --> 02:09:05,380
We are anticipating like
you all for the verdict

2289
02:09:05,420 --> 02:09:07,380
Let's meet again in the next programme

2290
02:09:07,420 --> 02:09:08,420
Thank you, bye

2291
02:09:08,740 --> 02:09:10,900
Sir, he is Jackdoss

2292
02:09:10,940 --> 02:09:14,140
Hey, say in the court tomorrow
that you've done all these for Prabhakar

2293
02:09:14,180 --> 02:09:15,220
- Okay?
- Okay, sir

2294
02:09:15,260 --> 02:09:17,700
Dude, don't blabber that you've
done this for sake of money

2295
02:09:17,780 --> 02:09:18,660
Nothing like that, sir

2296
02:09:18,700 --> 02:09:20,540
- Take care
- I'm leaving, sir

2297
02:09:22,620 --> 02:09:25,500
Inquiry on public welfare petition
of fake registration marriage

2298
02:09:25,540 --> 02:09:26,740
Item No16

2299
02:09:26,780 --> 02:09:28,140
Petitioner Gurudevan

2300
02:09:29,340 --> 02:09:30,260
My Lordship!

2301
02:09:30,300 --> 02:09:32,500
The Sub-registrar involved in
this case has come here

2302
02:09:32,540 --> 02:09:36,300
I request you to inquire him
and take a good decision

2303
02:09:36,380 --> 02:09:39,500
Ask the Sub-registrar Neela narayanan
to appear

2304
02:09:39,740 --> 02:09:41,300
Registrar Mr Neela narayanan

2305
02:09:48,740 --> 02:09:50,980
I solemn, what I say is true

2306
02:09:51,180 --> 02:09:53,300
I swear, what I say is true

2307
02:09:53,380 --> 02:09:55,220
Why did you attempt suicide?

2308
02:09:55,260 --> 02:09:56,660
Two days ago,

2309
02:09:56,740 --> 02:10:02,460
I gave a fake marriage certificate
to a girl called Lakshmi, who was not alive

2310
02:10:02,660 --> 02:10:05,220
But six months ago,
for the same girl,

2311
02:10:05,260 --> 02:10:09,380
I had registered her marriage
with Saravanan and gave a fake certificate

2312
02:10:09,580 --> 02:10:12,540
Because of my fake signature
for sake of money,

2313
02:10:12,580 --> 02:10:18,420
Lakshmi's family was scattered,
unable to bear the shame

2314
02:10:19,060 --> 02:10:22,580
I felt agonised since I committed
a great sin

2315
02:10:22,660 --> 02:10:24,900
I pleaded god to take me
to his abode,

2316
02:10:24,980 --> 02:10:27,260
so decided to consume poison
and attempted suicide

2317
02:10:27,300 --> 02:10:30,180
Can we consider,
it's your speech in this video?

2318
02:10:30,220 --> 02:10:32,300
Yes, it's true
I said it

2319
02:10:32,340 --> 02:10:34,780
You've done the marriage registration
without the bride

2320
02:10:34,860 --> 02:10:38,980
Inspite of knowing, how it'll affect the girl
and her parents, you did this mistake

2321
02:10:39,020 --> 02:10:42,340
If I don't sign, the advocates involved
in that case will not spare me

2322
02:10:42,380 --> 02:10:45,940
Now I understand,
how great sin I've committed

2323
02:10:45,980 --> 02:10:49,420
Does the Public prosecutor
have any questions against this witness?

2324
02:10:49,940 --> 02:10:51,020
Yes, my lordship

2325
02:10:54,140 --> 02:10:56,820
Mr Neela narayanan
I saw your video

2326
02:10:56,860 --> 02:11:00,300
You said that you signed out of fear
And you said that you signed for money

2327
02:11:00,340 --> 02:11:05,460
But in that video, you ask someone
opposite to you, "should I drink it"?

2328
02:11:05,540 --> 02:11:06,660
To whom did you ask it?

2329
02:11:06,700 --> 02:11:09,300
Sir, that is
A mirror was on the opposite side

2330
02:11:09,380 --> 02:11:11,940
And to the image of my conscience,
I was talking

2331
02:11:12,020 --> 02:11:14,140
Good reply

2332
02:11:14,180 --> 02:11:16,620
You did the register marriage
for a girl in the morning

2333
02:11:16,660 --> 02:11:22,580
By evening, how do you know that girl
was not alive and died six months ago

2334
02:11:22,660 --> 02:11:24,140
That is

2335
02:11:24,220 --> 02:11:25,100
Tell me

2336
02:11:25,180 --> 02:11:27,900
Because of the fake
marriage of Lakshmi, her

2337
02:11:27,940 --> 02:11:31,900
brother-in-law Prabhakar
was convicted of murder

2338
02:11:31,980 --> 02:11:35,860
He was the one who recorded
this fake marriage and

2339
02:11:35,900 --> 02:11:39,060
tried to reveal this big
mistake to the world

2340
02:11:39,140 --> 02:11:41,900
Okay, to prove him as an innocent,
you say he told you to reveal so

2341
02:11:41,940 --> 02:11:43,620
You want to say that he
didn't threaten you,

2342
02:11:43,660 --> 02:11:45,620
made to confess or forced
you to commit suicide

2343
02:11:45,660 --> 02:11:47,500
Then, why did you speak LIVE on Facebook?

2344
02:11:47,540 --> 02:11:50,220
Just to reveal everyone

2345
02:11:50,260 --> 02:11:52,860
All of a sudden, you got wisdom, is it?

2346
02:11:52,900 --> 02:11:54,140
Yes, sir

2347
02:11:54,260 --> 02:11:58,700
The police department says as per your record,
such a register marriage didn't happen

2348
02:11:58,740 --> 02:12:00,420
If you don't have trust on me,

2349
02:12:00,460 --> 02:12:04,300
…you check the CCTV camera
in the register office

2350
02:12:04,380 --> 02:12:05,980
He is troubled mentally, my lordship

2351
02:12:06,020 --> 02:12:10,660
Ten days ago, he complained that
CCTV cameras in his office wasn't functioning

2352
02:12:10,700 --> 02:12:12,780
I've kept that complaint
for your perusal, my lord

2353
02:12:18,500 --> 02:12:19,180
No, sir

2354
02:12:19,260 --> 02:12:21,380
I didn't give any such complaint

2355
02:12:22,020 --> 02:12:24,420
You're troubled mentally, sir

2356
02:12:24,580 --> 02:12:26,860
The report given by
the police states, no

2357
02:12:26,900 --> 02:12:29,260
register marriage has
happened like you said

2358
02:12:29,300 --> 02:12:35,860
You said, a stranger who failed in love,
threatened you to talk and to commit suicide

2359
02:12:35,900 --> 02:12:38,260
How do you swift your stance
within a day?

2360
02:12:38,340 --> 02:12:40,860
I told so, in dizziness

2361
02:12:40,900 --> 02:12:43,780
Sir, he is perplexing me in someway

2362
02:12:43,820 --> 02:12:46,860
It's true, I've done mistake

2363
02:12:46,900 --> 02:12:49,860
I feel panic
I need to take rest

2364
02:12:50,140 --> 02:12:52,300
Mr Gurudev, shall we send him?

2365
02:12:52,380 --> 02:12:54,340
No questions, my lord
He can go

2366
02:12:54,500 --> 02:12:55,820
You can go to the hospital

2367
02:12:55,860 --> 02:12:58,060
If necessary, you'll be called again
for an inquiry

2368
02:12:58,100 --> 02:13:00,300
- Thank you, my lordship
- Thank you, sir

2369
02:13:03,900 --> 02:13:08,300
It's clear, the public prosecutor doesn't want
to render anything good to people

2370
02:13:08,340 --> 02:13:15,500
However, who recorded this fake marriage and
revealed this fraudulence to the world,

2371
02:13:15,540 --> 02:13:19,860
I present those witnesses before you

2372
02:13:21,180 --> 02:13:22,860
Jackdoss and Mary

2373
02:13:29,700 --> 02:13:30,540
Greetings, sir

2374
02:13:30,580 --> 02:13:33,740
I swear, what I say is true

2375
02:13:33,780 --> 02:13:36,100
Why did you accept this
fake marriage registration?

2376
02:13:36,140 --> 02:13:37,420
Prabhakar is my friend, sir

2377
02:13:37,500 --> 02:13:40,260
A similar fake marriage has happened
in his family and even the girl was murdered

2378
02:13:40,300 --> 02:13:41,940
He was blamed for it

2379
02:13:41,980 --> 02:13:44,740
To prove the fake marriage,
they asked me to do a favour, So, I did

2380
02:13:44,780 --> 02:13:46,140
Is this a favour?

2381
02:13:46,220 --> 02:13:49,540
Did you act as Lakshmi on that
day in the registrar office?

2382
02:13:49,580 --> 02:13:50,580
Yes, mam

2383
02:13:50,620 --> 02:13:52,820
Everytime they will call me to sign

2384
02:13:52,860 --> 02:13:57,460
I'll also sign for Rs5000
I've one year old child

2385
02:13:57,500 --> 02:13:59,500
I did by mistake
Please, forgive me sir

2386
02:13:59,540 --> 02:14:01,740
Public prosecutor, you can proceed

2387
02:14:02,180 --> 02:14:03,180
Yes, your lordship

2388
02:14:06,340 --> 02:14:09,540
Do you know, you will get punishment
for acting as a cheating bride?

2389
02:14:09,580 --> 02:14:11,700
Tell the truth and save yourself

2390
02:14:11,740 --> 02:14:14,140
It's true that I registered, sir
I wasn't clear till yesterday

2391
02:14:14,180 --> 02:14:15,180
Today, I'm clear

2392
02:14:15,220 --> 02:14:18,540
You give me any punishment, sir
It's true that I signed at the registrar office

2393
02:14:18,580 --> 02:14:20,940
You can't get married another time
Think well and say

2394
02:14:21,020 --> 02:14:22,300
I don't want to get married, sir

2395
02:14:22,340 --> 02:14:25,620
Already, I got married for sake of money
and suffered a lot

2396
02:14:25,660 --> 02:14:26,700
I'll stay single, sir

2397
02:14:26,740 --> 02:14:28,140
So, you got married
for sake of money, right?

2398
02:14:28,180 --> 02:14:30,100
Not as favour?
No...no

2399
02:14:30,140 --> 02:14:31,660
You don't talk anything

2400
02:14:31,700 --> 02:14:33,780
Note this point, my lordship

2401
02:14:33,820 --> 02:14:36,620
First, he said as favour
And now saying, it's for money

2402
02:14:37,460 --> 02:14:40,860
All these is a conspiracy by someone
to instigate caste riots in the country

2403
02:14:40,980 --> 02:14:44,380
and to oppose love and
inter-caste marriages

2404
02:14:44,420 --> 02:14:46,300
They are here as fake witnesses
for sake of money

2405
02:14:46,340 --> 02:14:49,620
It's true that such a
register marriage didn't happen

2406
02:14:49,860 --> 02:14:52,940
A fake marriage can't be done
so easily, my lordship

2407
02:14:52,980 --> 02:14:57,540
So, dismiss this petition and I request
you to clear the fear and distrust…

2408
02:14:57,580 --> 02:15:00,980
…the people have on register marriages
and on the registration department

2409
02:15:01,020 --> 02:15:02,300
That's all, lordship

2410
02:15:02,580 --> 02:15:06,340
- Is any of you inquiring them?
- No questions, lordship

2411
02:15:06,380 --> 02:15:09,980
- You can go
- Thank you, your lordship

2412
02:15:10,900 --> 02:15:16,580
I request you to inquire
the victim's father and

2413
02:15:16,660 --> 02:15:20,460
the victim as the last
witness, my lordship

2414
02:15:20,500 --> 02:15:24,180
- Ask Mr Ramaswamy to appear
- Mr Ramaswamy

2415
02:15:26,460 --> 02:15:27,620
Greetings, sir

2416
02:15:27,780 --> 02:15:31,820
I'm running a textile shop for 25 years
at old washermanpet

2417
02:15:32,020 --> 02:15:36,940
Divya, my daughter had completed
her college five years ago

2418
02:15:36,980 --> 02:15:39,020
I've to fulfill my duty, isn't it?

2419
02:15:39,100 --> 02:15:42,740
So, I made her engagement with a groom

2420
02:15:42,780 --> 02:15:45,900
On the fourth day of engagement,
seven advocates…

2421
02:15:46,100 --> 02:15:50,780
…came to my house with my
ex-employee, Dharma Raj

2422
02:15:50,820 --> 02:15:54,340
They said, already my daughter Divya
and that scoundrel Dharmaraj…

2423
02:15:54,380 --> 02:15:57,980
…had done register marriage,
two months ago

2424
02:15:58,020 --> 02:16:01,260
And they gave the registered
marriage document

2425
02:16:01,300 --> 02:16:07,420
My heart was scattered
when looking at it

2426
02:16:09,820 --> 02:16:14,060
I inquired my daughter before
them whether it was true

2427
02:16:14,100 --> 02:16:18,660
"Dad, I don't know who is he
and I'm not related to him in any way"

2428
02:16:18,700 --> 02:16:20,420
…she said, cried and busted to the core

2429
02:16:20,460 --> 02:16:24,100
If the bridegroom's family knows this,
it'll be a humiliation to us

2430
02:16:24,140 --> 02:16:28,340
So, I decided to consume poison
and die along with the family

2431
02:16:29,860 --> 02:16:36,180
When trying to find out who did all these,
it's known this is a big fraudulent mob

2432
02:16:36,220 --> 02:16:41,260
I knew, this is not the target for my
daughter but for the money I have

2433
02:16:41,300 --> 02:16:42,980
I asked them how much they need

2434
02:16:43,060 --> 02:16:44,660
They asked five crores, sir

2435
02:16:44,700 --> 02:16:48,900
Somehow, I managed to give two crores
and redeemed my daughter

2436
02:16:48,980 --> 02:16:51,900
Then, I got my daughter married
to the engaged groom

2437
02:16:52,020 --> 02:16:54,500
They lived happily for two years

2438
02:16:54,620 --> 02:16:58,900
Suddenly, Dharmaraj threatened
my daughter that he will

2439
02:16:58,940 --> 02:17:05,820
reveal his divorce with her
to her husband and relatives

2440
02:17:05,860 --> 02:17:12,060
He said, 'If I shouldn't reveal this,
you must sleep with me a night'

2441
02:17:17,020 --> 02:17:22,340
My daughter came to
my home panicking and

2442
02:17:22,380 --> 02:17:26,740
said she will not live
anymore and will die

2443
02:17:26,820 --> 02:17:34,540
Then, I had a compromise with them
and gave almost five crores until now

2444
02:17:34,780 --> 02:17:37,580
Is it my fault to give birth
to a daughter?

2445
02:17:37,620 --> 02:17:38,820
Tell me, sir

2446
02:17:38,900 --> 02:17:40,940
Is it my fault to give birth
to a daughter?

2447
02:17:44,220 --> 02:17:49,340
None of the family should suffer
like me and my daughter

2448
02:17:49,500 --> 02:17:54,220
Give a good judgement, sir

2449
02:18:03,580 --> 02:18:04,820
Thank you, my lordship

2450
02:18:04,980 --> 02:18:11,380
The fake marriage which
the public prosecutor denies,

2451
02:18:11,500 --> 02:18:15,620
Was recorded by
a secret pen camera

2452
02:18:16,540 --> 02:18:19,220
It's for your perusal

2453
02:18:20,500 --> 02:18:22,100
You too watch it, sir

2454
02:19:04,060 --> 02:19:07,260
Do you have any doubt
on this video evidence?

2455
02:19:08,220 --> 02:19:09,900
Truth alone triumphs, my lordship

2456
02:19:09,980 --> 02:19:12,900
Based on the evidence given by the
police department, I've argued on this case

2457
02:19:12,940 --> 02:19:15,340
I don't have any queries
against this video

2458
02:19:15,380 --> 02:19:17,660
I admit myself
Thank you, my lordship

2459
02:19:18,580 --> 02:19:19,980
Justice will prevail

2460
02:19:20,300 --> 02:19:24,420
At present, in the
Hindu Marriage Registration process,

2461
02:19:24,460 --> 02:19:28,900
…based on these incidents, it's clear
there are many loopholes

2462
02:19:29,820 --> 02:19:33,540
In Tamil Nadu, at the
Chief Secretary office, Chennai

2463
02:19:33,580 --> 02:19:40,300
Just at one Sub-Registrar office,
3500 fake marriages have been registered

2464
02:19:40,380 --> 02:19:45,860
So, on the whole at Municipalities,
Corporations and Panchayats…

2465
02:19:45,900 --> 02:19:51,060
…how many fake marriages like
these would've been done?

2466
02:19:53,660 --> 02:19:57,580
It's against the
Indian Constitution law, clause 21

2467
02:19:57,820 --> 02:20:03,940
The Constitution of India provides
security for the citizens and their lives

2468
02:20:03,980 --> 02:20:08,300
But, because of the fake marriages
by these anti-socials,

2469
02:20:08,340 --> 02:20:11,380
it poses biggest threat to the security

2470
02:20:11,740 --> 02:20:14,220
The Government should intervene
and stop this, immediately

2471
02:20:14,260 --> 02:20:19,300
The law should be amended
with new conditions

2472
02:20:19,340 --> 02:20:24,620
and I request to order,
to transfer this case to the CBI

2473
02:20:24,660 --> 02:20:27,100
As per the Hindu Marriage Act,
Section 5

2474
02:20:27,140 --> 02:20:30,100
this marriage must be annulled

2475
02:20:30,140 --> 02:20:34,980
Moreover, I plead to make
it as a paradigm case, my lordship

2476
02:20:35,260 --> 02:20:40,220
Prabhakaran, who tried to bring this
case to the High court

2477
02:20:40,260 --> 02:20:45,500
where the police has registered a
fake case on him and kept him under arrest

2478
02:20:45,540 --> 02:20:51,660
The case number 216, the twin murders
which happened at 2018,

2479
02:20:51,700 --> 02:20:56,540
was investigated thoroughly
and the confessions got from

2480
02:20:56,580 --> 02:21:02,460
the witnesses is in
this hard disk, your honour

2481
02:21:02,500 --> 02:21:04,660
It's for your perusal

2482
02:21:09,620 --> 02:21:16,220
Using such fake marriages as weapons,
no one should be affected, henceforth

2483
02:21:16,540 --> 02:21:19,660
And to ensure the whole community
lives in peace

2484
02:21:19,700 --> 02:21:25,580
I request you to give a
historical judgement, my lordship

2485
02:21:28,140 --> 02:21:32,940
The judgement of this case
will be announced after 30 minutes

2486
02:21:33,940 --> 02:21:35,940
Prabhakar, don't worry

2487
02:21:36,140 --> 02:21:37,980
We got best doctors with us

2488
02:21:38,140 --> 02:21:39,780
Everything will be good

2489
02:21:39,820 --> 02:21:40,580
Thank you, doctor

2490
02:21:40,620 --> 02:21:42,860
We have to take her to
surgical theatre in two minutes

2491
02:21:50,300 --> 02:21:54,100
I didn't believe when you said
Our thoughts are more powerful

2492
02:21:55,220 --> 02:21:59,700
We can make the whole world
to understand a thing from where we are

2493
02:21:59,820 --> 02:22:01,300
I can understand it now, dear

2494
02:22:02,780 --> 02:22:05,100
Do you know how many people
are crying for you?

2495
02:22:07,700 --> 02:22:09,540
I believe you can heed me

2496
02:22:11,940 --> 02:22:15,540
I believe you will call me again
fondly as, 'dear'

2497
02:22:16,700 --> 02:22:17,980
Go boldly, dear

2498
02:22:23,020 --> 02:22:27,460
Dude, don't worry
Our deity will take care of Draupathi

2499
02:22:36,940 --> 02:22:41,380
In order to eliminate the flaws
in the fake register marriages,

2500
02:22:41,420 --> 02:22:45,900
When hearing this petition,
it was a great shock to the High court

2501
02:22:45,940 --> 02:22:50,380
In India, we all are living around
the culture of marriage

2502
02:22:50,420 --> 02:22:55,820
It's clearly understood, there is a threat
to individual human rights and security

2503
02:22:55,860 --> 02:23:00,740
Since, it's obvious that the register
marriages are beneficial to many men

2504
02:23:00,780 --> 02:23:03,620
and adverse to many women,

2505
02:23:03,660 --> 02:23:06,900
So, as per the provisions in section 5,

2506
02:23:06,940 --> 02:23:10,380
The court condemns the Public prosecutor,
the Police department

2507
02:23:10,420 --> 02:23:14,740
and the Registrar office
who tried to hide it

2508
02:23:15,260 --> 02:23:19,780
As per article 21, it's the duty of the
Government to protect the rights of the people

2509
02:23:19,820 --> 02:23:22,140
In that, there is clearly
a transgression,

2510
02:23:22,180 --> 02:23:24,980
Since more than 3000 fake
marriages were registered,

2511
02:23:25,060 --> 02:23:28,220
We order to transfer
this case to CBI and to

2512
02:23:28,260 --> 02:23:32,820
submit the investigation
report in two months

2513
02:23:32,860 --> 02:23:35,980
Moreover, the Sub- Registrar,
Mr Neela Narayanan

2514
02:23:36,020 --> 02:23:38,340
who accepted his faults,
will be detained from his job,

2515
02:23:38,380 --> 02:23:41,540
And this High court directs to confiscate
his immovable properties

2516
02:23:41,580 --> 02:23:44,860
bought during his job tenure
and hand over to the 'Disaster relief fund'

2517
02:23:46,180 --> 02:23:51,740
In this case, Prabhakar is being accused falsely
and since another case has been linked,

2518
02:23:51,780 --> 02:23:55,980
we recommend that these documents
be sent to Villupuram court

2519
02:23:56,020 --> 02:23:58,180
where the case is being held

2520
02:23:59,060 --> 02:24:03,340
From today, according to
Tamil Nadu Marriage Act 2009,

2521
02:24:03,420 --> 02:24:08,140
All register marriages should happen
in the presence of CCTV cameras

2522
02:24:08,180 --> 02:24:14,140
where the face of male and
female registrars should be recorded

2523
02:24:14,180 --> 02:24:19,860
The CCTV record evidence should be
protected in the Government digital archive

2524
02:24:19,900 --> 02:24:24,900
In the event of confusion, it can be
probed as an evidence

2525
02:24:24,940 --> 02:24:29,180
Henceforth, without CCTV cameras,
the register marriages shouldn't take place

2526
02:24:29,220 --> 02:24:33,220
From today, the High court enacts it as a law

2527
02:24:34,660 --> 02:24:40,060
Another request of demanding that
the register marriage should happen

2528
02:24:40,100 --> 02:24:42,420
in the presence of parents is
the registrar's wish

2529
02:24:42,460 --> 02:24:44,260
and it cannot be made as law

2530
02:24:44,300 --> 02:24:46,860
In India, all are equal

2531
02:24:46,900 --> 02:24:50,540
Everyone has the right to
choose their married life

2532
02:24:50,580 --> 02:24:53,300
Therefore, the High court declares

2533
02:24:53,340 --> 02:24:57,700
the enacted law should be
implemented, immediately

2534
02:25:01,500 --> 02:25:02,900
Thank you, your lordship

2535
02:25:04,460 --> 02:25:06,220
Yes, we got the judgement

2536
02:25:06,260 --> 02:25:08,940
Henceforth, the register marriages will not
happen without CCTV cameras

2537
02:25:08,980 --> 02:25:12,140
Good, Prabhakaran
It happened as your wife's intention

2538
02:25:15,500 --> 02:25:16,780
Dude!

2539
02:25:30,140 --> 02:25:31,780
It's a baby girl, Prabhakar

2540
02:25:39,700 --> 02:25:41,100
She is like our goddess!

2541
02:25:41,140 --> 02:25:42,020
Yes, dude

2542
02:25:42,060 --> 02:25:43,860
"My little Draupath!"
