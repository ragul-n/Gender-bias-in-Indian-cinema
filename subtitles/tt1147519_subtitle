00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,170
Oh, it's dark

3
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,230
Be careful

4
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,420
Watch it

5
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,290
Oh my God!

6
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:14,920
Look what's that!

7
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,040
What!

8
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,510
Jack...

9
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:03,230
Ha?

10
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,380
Dad

11
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,690
Dad...

12
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,410
Nobita

13
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,990
We came to the library for our summer task, remember?

14
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,020
I know

15
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,410
Then, tell me what's the title of our task?

16
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,120
Err...what is it...

17
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,390
You...

18
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,180
Nobita-san, did you forget?

19
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,980
We already set ocean as our topic

20
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,010
Right

21
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:08,170
I'll look for seas plant

22
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,990
Then I'll find out about metamorphosis from sea life

23
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,460
I'll fing out what fishes are delicious

24
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,740
I think this book have lots about sea

25
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,570
The ship left the dock

26
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,330
Towards the open seas

27
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,590
During their adventure, storm came and pass

28
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,040
At last, the ship arrive at the island where
the treasure are hidden

29
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,850
And they got all the treasure

30
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,200
Wow, cool!

31
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,290
This should to be my way of life

32
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,000
Ouch!

33
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,310
Find it more seriously!

Doraemon~

44
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,550
What's the hurry?

45
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,150
You must be chased by Giant again

46
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,330
No, look here

47
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,400
Treasure Island

48
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,760
No! There's no such thing!

49
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,280
You're going to say that you want to go to a treasure island

50
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,390
Actually, there's no treasure island

51
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,100
It's just a novel, a fiction

52
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,820
I'm dissapointed...

53
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,070
Just forget fictions like that

54
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,450
Better if you finish your task with the others

55
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,260
Mmm...it's been a while~

[The next news]

57
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,680
[A treasure island has been found]

58
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,530
[the treasure has been located]

59
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,240
What? What?

60
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,430
[it may belong to the pirates]

61
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,220
[there're gold coins and jewellery]

62
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,460
Cool~

63
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,360
[total estimated amount would be..]

64
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:47,520
[around 100 thousand yen]

65
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,620
[Next on the news]

66
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,930
You said that it's just a bluff

67
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,510
There's no way

68
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:57,850
There really treasure island

69
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,280
If we find them just now, we might've found them

70
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,910
I understand

71
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,780
~Hidden Treasure's Map~

72
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,190
This map divide this world into 360 pictures

73
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,030
Then use this to find the hidden treasure

74
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,920
When point to place with hidden treasure,

75
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,030
it'll make sound

76
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,630
OK, let's try

77
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,710
It's going to be a waste of time

78
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:20,370
Even though 1mm off, it won't make a sound

79
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,310
From find the treasure from all this maps

80
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,530
you'll need God knows how many years

81
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,610
Better if you just study

82
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,410
No way!

83
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:32,710
This island

84
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,510
On your first try

85
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,430
Maybe I'm dreaming

86
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,840
~Dream's Checker~

87
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,330
It's hurt... Hurt... not a dream...

88
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,330
Let's go

89
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,730
We cannot let anyone else find it first

90
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,630
I know

91
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,150
This is... Carribean Sea

92
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,500
Let's use Door To Anywhere

93
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,420
Wait

94
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,670
Where's the fun if its that easy

95
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,580
I want to have some adventure

96
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,190
On the sea

97
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,480
Use my energy against the wave

98
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:06,850
Fight against pirates

99
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,480
Only then...

100
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,360
find the treasure

101
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,750
Anyway, we should take out Door To Anywhere

102
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,690
Wait

103
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,360
What else?

104
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,450
I want to ask Shizuka

105
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,440
Do it yourself

106
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,960
Treasure island?

107
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:29,630
Right

108
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:34,140
Nobita, what about our group task?

109
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:36,770
Er..well..

110
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,680
I want to go to the sea

111
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,500
Who knows if there're things to observe

112
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,040
Right

113
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:44,420
Well then, let's go

114
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,570
Doraemon

115
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:51,450
Sorry disturbing~

116
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,420
Welcome~

117
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,380
I've prepared our ship

118
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,990
Now, sail our way to the treasure island, let's go!

119
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,050
The sea is wonderful

120
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,900
So? Coming here is great, isn't it?

121
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:16,350
Yes

122
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,540
I always want this kind of adventure

123
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:33,240
Doraemon, is there any hat for me?

124
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,910
There's only one on this ship

125
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,930
Lend me, then

126
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,560
It's mine, it might be big

127
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,590
Wha..too big..

128
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,380
Your head's big

129
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,030
From birth

130
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,360
Then let me lead the ship

131
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,240
It's just for display

132
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,270
Rilex

133
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:56,190
The ship move automatically

134
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:57,770
Then that one?

135
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,620
Also for display

136
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,790
If we use this ship,

137
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:03,700
when will we be there?

138
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:06,760
That case, even I don't know

139
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,350
That's why i said use Door To Anywhere

140
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:14,330
Absolutely not! I want some adventure

141
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,230
If we just go there easily

142
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,750
That is boring

143
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,780
Are pirates going to show up?

144
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,600
There're no pirates nowadays

145
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,130
It has been hundreds of years past

146
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,290
Then, there might be storm

147
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,150
No way!

148
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,700
Not really, if you want some storm...

149
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,500
~Artificial Storm~

150
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,310
This gadget is to give more sensation during sailing

151
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:46,300
The black cloud only around above of our ship

152
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:50,680
It looks like going to be a storm

153
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,200
It looks scary

154
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,580
Looks like the winds getting stronger

155
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,470
Shizuka

156
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,520
Are you okay, Nobita?

157
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,580
Well? Very adventurous, right?

158
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,570
This is too much, stop it

159
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,280
Before the cloud disperse, there's no way stopping it

160
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,290
Don't worry

161
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,730
This is just artificial storm

162
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,920
It will not sink the ship

163
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,410
I know, but

164
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,290
I'm getting sea sick

165
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,790
Pirates! Pirate's ship!

166
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,700
Pirate ship

167
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,940
Impossible

168
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,680
I'm serious

169
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,710
We cannot be like this

170
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,790
There really is a pirate ship

171
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,920
You...

172
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,690
imagine too much

173
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,840
The pirate ship was there

174
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,870
You always think about pirate

175
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,710
That's why you always imagine things

176
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:33,670
Wait till storm stop before we continue our journey

177
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:51,780
Oh, why don't we ask Giant to be pirate?

178
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,280
Are they going to?

179
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,570
I have a great idea

180
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:56,740
What idea?

181
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,090
For seafood, I would say Sanma fish are the best

182
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,800
After that Kamaboko

183
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:07,010
Say, is Nobita doing his work seriously?

184
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,200
Oh yeah, if I

185
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,430
Find the subject with all my heart

186
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,170
Eh? What's this?

187
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:15,530
Said: Group of sea observer, this way

188
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,790
This must be Nobita

189
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,950
There's another one

190
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,720
South Sea Treasure Island?

191
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,070
There's another one

192
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,460
What's he up to?

193
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,030
We're asked to wear the hat

194
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,530
Is he playing with us?

195
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:33,610
Done

196
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:35,500
Look there

197
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,910
Door To Anywhere

198
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,860
What's he up to?

199
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,690
Wah...we're on a ship

200
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,180
Yay~ Giant the pirate

201
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,910
You came at last

202
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,120
Pirate?

203
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,760
Looks like we are being made the pirate

204
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,960
Let's race to the treasure island

205
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,690
Don't be joking!

206
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,950
We're busy

207
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,930
No time to play with you

208
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:09,570
Doraemon

209
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,950
No worry, that's just artificial cannon

210
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:13,890
It will not hit the target

211
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,410
Nobita, are you okay?

212
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,550
In the South Pacific Sea

213
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,340
A few unlikely weather happened

214
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,930
A few mirage appear

215
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,600
Weird

216
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,600
This incident affect ship's radar

217
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:31,310
It wouldn't affect our house, ey

218
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,450
Those who supposed to be worrying

219
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:35,790
are those who always moving

220
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,810
At this moment, better if just stay put in the house

221
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,650
What can be done? The Artificial Machine is broken

222
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:49,010
Well then, we'll join too finding the treasure

223
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,620
There really are treasure?

224
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,960
Really, I found them

225
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,010
On the Tomos Island in Carribean Sea

226
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,230
Tomos Island

227
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:59,950
First, we should repair our ship

228
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,140
Look, there's an island

229
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,340
Treasure island, ey?

230
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,210
No way. We're still long way to go

231
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:11,090
We'll stop by the island first to repair the ship.

232
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,560
As I imagined, its an island with no man

233
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,210
This's our island

234
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,190
Yay~

235
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,320
Since I want to repair the ship, then...

236
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,840
~Changing Clothes Camera~

237
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,760
Change to swim suit first

238
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,190
Yahoo~

239
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,370
The water's clean

240
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,500
Oh? Nobita can't swim?

241
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,700
You know already I don't

242
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,060
Nobita, come here hurry

243
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,800
Can't swim, ey?

244
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,210
~Changing Shape Loop~

245
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:53,150
Put the card, then you enter this loop

246
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,560
Then you'll change shape

247
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,000
Hurry, go swimming

248
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,170
But the time limit juz for 10 minutes

249
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,020
Understand, thanks

250
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,080
Enter fish's card

251
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,240
Then I'll be able to swim

252
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:11,360
That looks scary

253
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,210
Better if just half of the body

254
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,870
Trun into a merman

255
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,550
Okay, I'll give them a shock

256
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,500
I can swim

257
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,890
Wait for me, Suneo

258
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:49,440
See, I can stand

259
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,490
Really, cool!

260
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,880
I know, there must me a stone down there!

261
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,430
Busted!

262
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,690
Just bluffing

263
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,830
I'm just joking

264
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,780
What a perv, Suneo

265
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,000
There's someting

266
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,840
It's me, chase me if you can

267
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,270
Nobita, wait

268
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:22,340
So good~

269
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,880
Help me..I'm dro..

270
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,760
Pirate's ship

271
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,150
Nobita, are you okay?

272
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,490
Who asked you to play trick on us

273
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,360
Right

274
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,620
Actually what happened?

275
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:57,850
Pirate's ship...

276
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,020
Pirate's ship appear there...

277
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,120
There....There...

278
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,420
Nobita

279
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:03,950
Yay~

280
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:08,930
I'm telling truth, believe me

281
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:10,280
Behind those stones

282
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,510
There's nothing there

283
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,730
I saw it there

284
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,690
I'm serious

285
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:20,140
Nobita, look. Sunset, it's beautiful...

286
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,570
Right

287
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,380
Seeing sea,

288
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,530
my heart feel very calm

289
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,950
I guess that's because

290
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,120
All life

291
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:34,040
strat from the sea

292
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,970
Then, sea is the mother for all life oraganism

293
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:41,540
Then all kani and kai are my relatives?

294
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,500
If Nobita

295
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,460
His relative most probably kurage

296
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,570
I need to go home now

297
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,910
What if we just stay here for a while?

298
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,120
Leave it to me

299
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,200
We could use Door To Anywhere to set our time to go home

300
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,550
Oh, okay

301
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,070
Then for sure

302
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,530
Tonight, we camp here

303
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:03,440
Agree

304
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,140
It was seriously there

305
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,510
You are hard-headed

306
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,740
Seeing imaginary in a row

307
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,490
Look! Dolphins!

308
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:22,490
Right

309
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:36,240
Because this ship is beyond repair

310
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,930
We use this ship to go to the island

311
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,500
Everybody

312
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,800
to avoid boreness

313
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,590
Let's learn a few things about the sea

314
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,590
Okay

315
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,130
~Legendary Exist Machine~

316
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:54,500
We'll be able to see fairytale monsters and sea monsters

317
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,190
Okay, okay

318
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:57,200
Start

319
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:00,680
Now, look at the sea

320
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,480
Wah... mermaid

321
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:03,330
Right

322
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,060
There's a sea snake monster over here

323
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,690
Cool!

324
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,600
Doraemon

325
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,230
What?

326
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,580
Poseidon

327
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,610
Looks like he's looking at at

328
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,570
Doraemon, do something

329
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,280
He block this ship

330
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,380
He's going to destroy this ship

331
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,200
Doraemon

332
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,620
We past it

333
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,090
What really happen?

334
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:00,580
Sorry... Sorry...

335
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:03,200
These are just 4D picture. It won't affect us

336
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,620
So? Very amusing, right?

337
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,000
Doraemon

338
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,620
Don't suprise me like that

339
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:11,490
Giant Octopus

340
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,930
That's just another 4D picture, don't worry

341
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,170
What else now?

342
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:21,700
Green Sea Monster

343
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,260
Cute, ey

344
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,910
Just another 4D

345
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,420
What's this?

346
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,520
Doraemon!

347
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,090
Supposed there's no such monsters

348
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,460
What happen?

349
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,500
Is the machine broken?

350
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,390
I don't think so, but for precaution

351
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,380
I'll turn off the machine

352
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:59,240
Thank god the ship's okay

353
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,930
With this condition, will we make it to the island?

354
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,350
Don't worry

355
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:07,880
After being zoomed, it's much clearer

356
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,930
More resembles of a treasure map

357
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:12,760
More into the mood

358
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,670
Next, you can do anything on this ship

359
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:20,910
What's with you?

360
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,650
What happen? what happen?

361
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,300
Crap...

362
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,650
What happened?

363
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,520
I can't believe waters ooz out from the pocket

364
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,940
Are you okay?

365
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:40,700
I think 4D space in my pocket is acting weird

366
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:47,760
What now, Doraemon?

367
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,800
Its not mistaken, there's something wrong with 4D space

368
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,950
Pirate!

369
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,700
We're split

370
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,160
Nobita, give me your hand

371
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,620
Nobita, hold on

372
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,260
Don't release your hand

373
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,810
Nobita...

374
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:45,860
Nobita...

375
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:15,650
Everybody, we're safe

376
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,260
Where's this place?

377
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,750
Looks like a ship's cargo space

378
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,290
Someone was helping us, thank god

379
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,140
What?

380
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,380
What's happening?

381
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,030
War?

382
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:45,900
Impossible

383
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,800
Looks like they're shooting film

384
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,990
But the cannon looks real

385
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:02,160
Looks like pirate's real war

386
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:03,370
Cool

387
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:04,650
Danger!

388
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,650
Giant, Suneo

389
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,390
Doraemon

390
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,060
Are you okay?

391
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,040
Suneo is here too

392
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,330
What really happened?

393
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,890
I don't know

394
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:25,070
Damn it! We forgot about Shizuka!

395
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,130
I'll be going, Suneo, you stay here

396
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,020
Let me go!

397
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,480
Stay inside!

398
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,690
Thanks

399
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,160
Danger!

400
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,730
Do..Doraemon...

401
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,420
I have to do something

402
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:57,460
Eee?

403
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,940
My pocket's gone!

404
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,540
What to do? My, my, what to do?

405
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:12,660
Mouse, mouse...mouse..

406
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,360
What!

407
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,500
Dora-chan

408
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:47,870
Are you okay?

409
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,200
Hang in there

410
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,800
Thank you for everything..thanks...

411
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,590
Doraemon, this isn't a dream, is it?

412
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:02,390
Is this related to the 4D picture just now?

413
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:04,240
No, this looks real

414
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:08,930
Looks like we were sent to the 17th century

415
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:10,720
Really?

416
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:13,330
Let's go back to 20th century

417
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:15,670
We can't, my pocket and gadgets

418
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,760
all was swept by the current

419
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,270
Mama~

420
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,040
Stop crying!

421
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:23,660
What're you doing?

422
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,380
Don't be a baby

423
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:27,090
What do you mean?

424
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,460
We need to figure out a way to communicate

425
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:32,440
Let me try

426
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:36,190
I'm Doraemon

427
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:37,580
What's that?

428
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,810
I found it, around there

429
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:41,510
Really?

430
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:44,070
Hey, stop it!

431
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:48,880
Eyy~

432
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,000
Doraemon, what's with you?

433
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,660
Love...love....love...

434
00:27:55,850 --> 00:28:01,210
love....love...love...oh my love...

435
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:04,540
love...love...love...

436
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:05,850
What's this?

437
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,690
Ey? what happened to me?

438
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,250
You were hit with this

439
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,760
That's Love Arrow!

440
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,190
That's my stuff!

441
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:14,730
They found it

442
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,080
Is there the pocket also?

443
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:17,120
No

444
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:19,360
Thank god it's here

445
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:22,260
~Translation Konyaku~

446
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:25,250
Again, my name's Doraemon

447
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:28,780
You can speak our tounge?

448
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:29,610
Is that possible?

449
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,680
I'm Captain Kid

450
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,670
This is my sister's kid, Betty

451
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,770
Nice to know you

452
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,460
My name's Pancho

453
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,650
My name's Gonzales

454
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,680
Nice to meet you

455
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,090
We too

456
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:45,790
Actually, who are yo?

457
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:48,470
Actually, Nobita want some adven...

458
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:51,050
Nobita!

459
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,430
Other than us

460
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:55,340
Did you save another boy?

461
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,760
We just save 4 of you

462
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:58,930
Nobita

463
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,100
He was such a good kid...

464
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,130
Don't cry! who cry I'll...

465
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,440
Don't be harsh, Betty

466
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:08,980
This...

467
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,650
Betty, look at this

468
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,000
This...

469
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,080
Totally the same

470
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:16,710
How could they have the treasure map?

471
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:22,700
Nobita, where are you...

472
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,290
Only if I held him

473
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,580
Nobita...

474
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:41,280
This all because I lost my pocket

475
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:43,210
Based on Betty,

476
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:46,780
he might be stranded to amall island around here

477
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,190
But Nobita can't swim

478
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,900
Doraemon

479
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,610
Is there any gadget that can find Nobita?

480
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,340
There's only this 7 gadget left

481
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:57,030
And, not the useful one, I'd say

482
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,680
I wanna go home. Mama...

483
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,400
Before I could find Nobita...

484
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,850
I wouldn't go home

485
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:15,930
You were looking for your brother, ey?

486
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:20,060
Before I could find dad and Jack,

487
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:21,580
I won't go home

488
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,310
Nobita

489
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,250
Glasses...Glasses...

490
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,300
Here it is

491
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,410
Who are you? Are you from this island?

492
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,160
Our language is different, ey?

493
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:23,570
I'm safe

494
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:28,720
But where's this?

495
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,100
Doraemon

496
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:35,130
Next, what should I do?

497
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:39,990
Pink Iruka!

498
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,310
Dolphin

499
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,160
You call it dolphin, ey

500
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,350
Dolphin

501
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:02,670
I remember! This dolphin

502
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:04,080
He saved me back then

503
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:07,640
He's your friend

504
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:10,120
He help you find food?

505
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:11,750
Thank you, dolphin

506
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,350
Thanks, dolphin

507
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:26,710
There's no one else, huh? You're alone?

508
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:30,520
Oh, language problems

509
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:33,750
It would be good if there's Translation Konyaku

510
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:45,700
Cool! You did it yourself?

511
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:47,040
Don't move!

512
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:49,970
Wha...What? I'm not a bad person

513
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,740
What're you doin'?!

514
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,780
Don't think because you're small I will not hurt you

515
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,250
It's a poisonous spider

516
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,890
Thank you...thanks...you saved me

517
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:06,610
I'm Nobi Nobita

518
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,810
No...bi?

519
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,540
Nobita

520
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:13,600
Nobi?

521
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,490
Yes...Yes..

522
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,250
Jack

523
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,190
Jack

524
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:19,830
Yes, jack

525
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,020
Nobi

526
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:22,160
Jack

527
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:22,930
Nobi

528
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:23,740
Jack

529
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:24,920
Nobi

530
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:42,010
Jack, you're amazing

531
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,440
All this done by yourself

532
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:48,090
Jack, you're here with this little boat, ey?

533
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,520
Nobi, eat it

534
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:52,370
Thank you...thank you...

535
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,620
It's Oishii (Delicious)!

536
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,310
Oh! See!

537
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,350
No! No! OISHII! (Delicious)

538
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:03,520
Oh, I see...

539
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,930
Looks like this island's inhabited

540
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,260
Jack, wait

541
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:21,380
What if we get lost?

542
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,620
Mo..

543
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:26,030
On unhabited island, finding food would be hard

544
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,080
Nobi!

545
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:30,640
Jack, can't you walk slower?

546
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:34,940
Look!

547
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:37,620
It's beautiful

548
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,380
There's so many fruit

549
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,900
All this free, ey?

550
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,010
Watch out!

551
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,500
Hard to believe

552
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:53,090
What fruit is this? So good~

553
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:55,520
Nobi

554
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,130
Jack, danger!

555
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:11,070
Jack, run!

556
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,660
That's scary

557
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,670
Thanks, Nobi

558
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:33,200
Jack, cool

559
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:35,800
Very brave... but...

560
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,400
What's with this island?

561
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,490
All we can see is sea

562
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:58,230
When'll we reach the island?

563
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,500
This is just a small ship, what can we do...

564
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:03,160
Everyone, sorry for waiting

565
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,970
I was talking with Captain Kid for a while

566
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:08,140
Doraemon, your pocket was found?

567
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,620
This...

568
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:10,870
Let's find Nobita, hurry!

569
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:13,870
It's hurt...Giant, let me go...

570
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,720
This's just a picture

571
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,500
Because leaving it blank look too ugly

572
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,520
Don't do stupid thing

573
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:21,090
Sorry...

574
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,690
Hoi, there's an island

575
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,780
We can see the island

576
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,530
Judging by the water's current

577
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:37,840
The place most probably your friend float

578
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,660
would be this Tomos Island

579
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,270
Tomos Island

580
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,170
Right, although happen coincidently

581
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:45,860
That's the treasure island that searched by Nobita

582
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:48,170
Let's hit the land

583
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:50,810
Wait till morning before land

584
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:53,560
So many corals around the island

585
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:55,200
Trying to do it at night would be a suicide

586
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:56,870
Then I'll go...

587
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,190
This ship's captain is me!

588
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:00,950
I cannot let anyone do whatever he wishes!

589
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:05,940
And, you're not the only one who want to find their lost friends

590
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,720
Nobita, can swim, don't you think?

591
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,110
Of course

592
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:21,610
Because all life organism

593
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,020
came from the sea

594
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:26,140
Then, no organism in the world that can't swim

595
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,320
I can even swim in the air

596
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,540
I can do this style too

597
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,690
It's like a dream, ey

598
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:34,110
Shizuka?

599
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:35,340
A dream?

600
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,470
Very refreshing~

601
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:50,460
Are there really treasures?

602
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,000
What about our summer task?

603
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:54,650
This is not the moment for that

604
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:57,690
Are you okay? Don't let go

605
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,020
Nobita doesn't even know where the treasure

606
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:01,730
Right, isn't it?

607
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,320
Right..

608
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,440
Nobita

609
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:14,180
Very refreshing

610
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:34,820
Hello Jack

611
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:38,100
Doraemon, you came to save me at last

612
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,290
Who're you?

613
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,140
Jack, let's go home

614
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:42,900
Doraemon

615
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,040
Jack

616
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:45,160
Doraemon Doraemon

617
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,340
Let's go home

618
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:48,180
Okay

619
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,450
Doraemon

620
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:53,500
I cannot understand Japanese

621
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:55,110
Doraemon

622
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,540
Oh, it's a dream

623
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:58,850
Dad

624
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,930
Daddy, Betty

625
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,790
Jack, you're too like me

626
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:10,240
I have to be strong

627
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:38,980
Doraemon

628
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,590
What are you bringing?

629
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,570
Although might be useless,

630
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,240
but it's better if I keep the gadgets

631
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,570
We don't know if Nobita's there

632
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:48,560
He's there, for real

633
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,920
Dad, Jack

634
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:56,700
Betty is looking for someone too?

635
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:57,730
Yes, right

636
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:59,150
Her dad and little brother

637
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,220
They never return from this island

638
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,000
That's the case..

639
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:06,530
She very love her little brother

640
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,020
Jack

641
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,830
Dad

642
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,620
Okay

643
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:14,090
Let's find all over this island

644
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,130
Okay

645
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,620
Let's move!

646
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:25,120
Suneo, what're you doing?

647
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:30,030
To tell Nobita we're here, I left my clothes here

648
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:30,940
What do you think?

649
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:33,650
Great idea. I'll leave mine too

650
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:41,460
Nobita

651
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:46,680
Nobita

652
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:51,820
Nobita

653
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:57,120
Nobita

654
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:03,600
Nobita

655
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:07,060
I hear it

656
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:08,380
Doraemon's voice...

657
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,880
Nothing, maybe just my imagination

658
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:19,150
Sorry...

659
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:20,400
What's wrong?

660
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:22,940
Dissapointing...

661
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:24,090
Are you okay?

662
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:29,060
Nobi, look! ship! Ship!

663
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:31,590
Jack!

664
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,570
That's Captain Kid's ship

665
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:41,570
That ship

666
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:45,180
Nobi, let's go

667
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,670
Jack, that's a pirate ship

668
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,700
That's Giant and Suneo's clothes

669
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:53,650
They have been captured by pirates

670
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,840
Nobi, come on

671
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:58,130
Jack, you could be captured by them

672
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:02,180
I can't swim

673
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,050
Nobi

674
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:07,500
Nobi

675
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,470
Nobi

676
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,870
Saved by you again

677
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,420
Where do you wanna go actually?

678
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,630
Nobita

679
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:59,640
Nobita

680
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,730
Nobita might not be on this island

681
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,430
No, he must be here

682
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:06,310
How could you be so sure?

683
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,410
Based on my instinct

684
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:10,510
What?

685
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,020
What do you mean?

686
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:12,810
Guys!

687
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:13,790
Enough...enough...

688
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,500
Wait Gonzales

689
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:18,540
What is it, Pancho?

690
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:20,190
This watermelon look delicious

691
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:22,350
Try a bit, I'll have some...

692
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,180
Enough... enough...

693
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,430
Why?

694
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:27,210
What is it?

695
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:28,890
What happened?

696
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:32,960
It licking...

697
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:34,440
What's with this melon?

698
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:43,090
Just to scare little child

699
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:44,580
I'll chop you off

700
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,470
What's that?

701
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,100
Ghost!

702
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,120
What's this?

703
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:10,000
Potato Monster!

704
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:20,830
Pancho, what's that?

705
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:21,950
I never see it before

706
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,010
Looks like spider and bees

707
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:27,120
Spidery Bees?

708
00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:50,870
Pancho, are you okay?

709
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:52,350
Where's the other?

710
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:55,740
Looks like everybody are scattering

711
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:56,930
Kid

712
00:44:57,230 --> 00:44:59,030
Are you all okay?

713
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,380
What happen to this island? We need to check it out first

714
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:06,040
Captain, what should we do?

715
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:07,330
We move on

716
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,960
Doraemon, what about us?

717
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:12,100
Looks like in order to find Nobita,

718
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,380
we have to unravel this island's secret

719
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:17,770
We follow Captain Kid, then

720
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,520
Looks like a cave's entrance

721
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:48,510
Above this waterfall

722
00:45:57,070 --> 00:46:00,230
Where're we headed, actually?

723
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,200
Eh? The current suddenly stronger

724
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:06,640
Dolphin, we're not going to get caught in the current, ey?

725
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:12,910
We'll be suck at the waterfall

726
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:14,100
Dolphin

727
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:18,780
Danger

728
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:20,990
Come back, hurry

729
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:22,180
Dolphin

730
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:25,050
Dolphin, some back

731
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:39,980
Salty! This's sea water

732
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:41,320
Nobi, look!

733
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,430
That's the outside

734
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:46,940
Dolphin, let's head back

735
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:48,930
Where're you going? Dolphin

736
00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:00,970
Owch.. Nobita wouldn't come to this place

737
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:02,890
Noisy, just follow the way

738
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:04,840
We wouldn't know if we didn't try

739
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,560
Is there anything funny?

740
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:11,560
I think Takeshi is a really brave person

741
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:13,250
No... Not really...

742
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:15,980
I like a person like you

743
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:16,910
Liar

744
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:19,590
Takeshi, are you okay?

745
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:20,330
Nothing

746
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:45,090
What is it, Pancho?

747
00:47:45,110 --> 00:47:45,980
There's a light, up there

748
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,570
Hot~ hot~

749
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:04,980
Hot~ hot~

750
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:05,960
Suneo

751
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:07,450
Everybody run inside

752
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:12,320
Mama

753
00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:13,890
Suneo, are you okay?

754
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:17,430
There's no burn at all

755
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:19,030
True

756
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:20,860
It was hot just now

757
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:22,750
Seriously hot

758
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:24,970
As if my butt were on fire

759
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:31,480
Many more games awaiting

760
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:33,600
The game

761
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:34,730
is just starting

762
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:39,000
There's a treasure chest

763
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,300
Right

764
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:41,590
Let's open it

765
00:48:42,830 --> 00:48:44,680
Wonder what's inside it

766
00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:48,360
Wait, chest!

767
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:49,640
Don't chase it anymore, Pancho

768
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:53,210
How can we just let it go?

769
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:55,200
Open the chest, hurry

770
00:48:58,470 --> 00:48:59,490
Scary...

771
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:02,730
Welcome, humans

772
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,710
Road in the inside

773
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:09,080
Is the road to hell

774
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,390
This cave is a bit weird

775
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:19,880
What really happened?

776
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:22,290
It almost resembles a game in 22nd century

777
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:23,760
which now really famous

778
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,930
This stone bridge too

779
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:31,810
What monster'll come up this time?

780
00:49:32,090 --> 00:49:32,910
Let's get across

781
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:37,860
That...umm...

782
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,820
Ah, I remember!

783
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:40,790
what will happen?

784
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,780
This bridge'll collapse

785
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:44,960
Captain!

786
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:48,770
You supposed to inform before we get across

787
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:49,870
Right

788
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,220
Next, what'll happen?

789
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:53,390
We'll fall to the river

790
00:49:56,030 --> 00:49:56,660
Mama

791
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:01,580
Suneo

792
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,300
Doraemon, are you okay?

793
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:08,700
Looks like I'm okay

794
00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:10,110
Giant

795
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:11,340
Betty!

796
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:12,310
It's okay

797
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:15,330
Betty, don't let go

798
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:18,280
Takeshi

799
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:20,610
I won't let it slip

800
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:22,660
This time, I won't let it go

801
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:25,450
Giant, fight!

802
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,110
Takeshi, thanks

803
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:30,960
Everyone's safe

804
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:33,030
Giant's really amazing

805
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:35,580
This river

806
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:38,130
Looks like a man-made river

807
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,080
Being made with high technology

808
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:42,130
Someone's coming

809
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:48,330
Found it

810
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,600
Who're you?

811
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,430
Give your pistol and surrender

812
00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:54,050
I won't

813
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:58,750
Kid-san

814
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,330
Don't struggle

815
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:01,790
Watch out

816
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:03,850
Giant

817
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:05,700
Better if we don't struggle

818
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:14,600
Dolphin, this looks like a tunnel

819
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,660
the...the exit

820
00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:36,410
What's this?

821
00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:55,580
What's that?

822
00:51:55,630 --> 00:51:57,490
Looks like a secret base

823
00:51:57,790 --> 00:51:58,910
Someone's coming!

824
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:03,440
Dolphin

825
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:11,260
Where're they?

826
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:12,440
We lost them

827
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:13,500
They'll come up soon

828
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:29,310
Surrender

829
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:30,310
Dolphin

830
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:32,000
Dolphin

831
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:35,330
Dolphin

832
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:37,400
Bring them

833
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:41,980
Let us go! Let...

834
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:45,140
Doraemon, that creature looks like a fish

835
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:46,250
What's that creature?

836
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:49,110
They also carry a weapon I never see

837
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:52,190
I think they're from the future

838
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:53,220
People from future?

839
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:55,720
True, everything in this island

840
00:52:55,790 --> 00:52:58,460
are impossible made by people from this century

841
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:00,360
If they came from the future...

842
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:02,210
Time criminal!

843
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,730
Time criminal?

844
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,010
Enter!

845
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:07,080
What happen?

846
00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:08,920
Nobita..

847
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:13,100
Do...Doraemon

848
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:14,560
Nobita..

849
00:53:15,010 --> 00:53:16,410
My best friend

850
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:16,800
Nobita

851
00:53:16,810 --> 00:53:18,130
You're safe

852
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:19,020
Jack

853
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:20,510
Betty

854
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:22,650
Nobita

855
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,170
You're with Jack

856
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:25,770
Jack, where's dad?

857
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:29,150
After he went to search the treasure, he never return

858
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,650
That's why I was left alone

859
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:34,090
That's what happen, you did great Jack

860
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,200
You're truly Cptain Colt's kid

861
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:38,900
Doraemon, give me the Translation Konyaku, hurry

862
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,980
I can't understand them

863
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,680
Right

864
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:46,660
But my magic pocket is gone

865
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:48,880
I left a bit for Nobita

866
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:50,320
Ey? Thanks..

867
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:54,870
Mr Kasshu want to see all of you

868
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:55,650
Move out, hurry

869
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:58,520
Work faster, don't get lazy

870
00:53:58,850 --> 00:53:59,870
Hurry

871
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:26,260
Look, Betty

872
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:28,900
Those who force to work are our friends

873
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:31,430
I think my dad is also being caught

874
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:38,920
These creature

875
00:54:38,930 --> 00:54:40,370
Each one is weird

876
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,440
Don't tell me they were created by human?

877
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:46,230
You!

878
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:47,990
Up! Stand up!

879
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:49,390
???

880
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:51,340
Wait, wait for a while

881
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,900
Dad! Dad!

882
00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:53,900
Betty

883
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:55,770
Let him rest for a while

884
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:56,380
Papa

885
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,170
Jack, danger

886
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,660
Stand up, now!

887
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:01,300
Hang in there

888
00:55:02,290 --> 00:55:04,060
Captain, I'm sorry

889
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:05,560
Walk faster

890
00:55:17,350 --> 00:55:19,210
Welcome, to Tomos Island

891
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:21,170
Your active act just now

892
00:55:21,170 --> 00:55:23,620
Has been a pleasure for me to watch

893
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:25,830
My name's Kasshu

894
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:27,670
I welcome you all

895
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:29,920
Ah! That green monster back there..

896
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:31,190
seems familiar

897
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:35,000
Looks like you already know each other

898
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:37,520
Because this creature always loose itself,

899
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:41,810
looks like you accidentally involved in my experiment

900
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:43,090
Experiment?

901
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:43,920
Don't tell me the experiment is...

902
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:46,280
time space manipulation?

903
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:49,340
Master Kasshu, everything is ready

904
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,970
I have something to show you all

905
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,690
Okay, look!

906
00:56:26,510 --> 00:56:28,930
This is...This is a time machine's ship

907
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:30,490
Time machine's ship?

908
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:32,660
Actually, what did he transported

909
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:40,530
Big success, it work just fine!

910
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:41,820
I understand

911
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:43,900
We've being affected by this time machine

912
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:45,920
Until accidentally sent to the 17th century

913
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:46,900
True

914
00:56:47,130 --> 00:56:49,680
You truly a 22nd century robot

915
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,490
How did you know?

916
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:54,380
Because for a while, I'll keep you gadget.

917
00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:57,010
What about my friend, Dolphin?

918
00:56:57,070 --> 00:56:59,650
If you refer to the iruka (dolphin), no need to worry

919
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:02,080
I've sent it to Professor Krone

920
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:05,320
Don't tell me, all weird creature on this island...

921
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:08,800
True, they're all Professor Krone's masterpiece

922
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:10,230
I understand

923
00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:11,820
The time machine's ship

924
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:14,380
is used to transfer the weird creature

925
00:57:14,590 --> 00:57:15,610
What for?

926
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:17,120
Of course to be sell

927
00:57:17,290 --> 00:57:18,330
Sell?

928
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:21,160
Right, that's my business

929
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:24,600
Transforming a creature from any century,
the pays are truly worthy

930
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,500
Especially creature that being use for war

931
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:29,880
This is illegal!

932
00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:33,330
It's against the law to transform a creature

933
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:35,260
It is illegal in 22nd century,

934
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:37,310
but not in this century

935
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:40,620
Is that so, Captain Kid?

936
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:43,720
Let go of my friends

937
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:45,490
No, I can't

938
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:48,600
I use hidden treasure to lure you here

939
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:51,290
and use you all work like ants on the island

940
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:54,780
So, work like an ants

941
00:57:54,830 --> 00:57:55,730
No way

942
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,720
Time police will not approve this

943
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:59,440
Thank you for your concern

944
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:02,270
As a present, I'll show you something

945
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:06,560
On this island, I'd installed protection wall already

946
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:08,110
Not just communication,

947
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:10,180
even a time tunnel will not be able to enter

948
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:13,370
Very amusing, right, Mr Rakoon?

949
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,410
I'm not a rakoon!

950
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,850
Sooner or later, this place'll be known upon

951
00:58:18,130 --> 00:58:21,110
Even if the time police come

952
00:58:21,470 --> 00:58:22,940
Look this

953
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:26,690
That's my ship

954
00:58:28,230 --> 00:58:30,940
Let's see it slowly

955
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:40,610
What's that?

956
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:46,180
Look! That's the greatest war creature!

957
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:48,570
Leviathan!

958
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:03,960
How dare you destroyed my ship!

959
00:59:06,190 --> 00:59:07,150
Captain Kid

960
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,950
So? Very amusing, isn't it?

961
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,340
This is Professor Krone's greatest masterpiece

962
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,030
I will not forgive you

963
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:25,050
What are you going to do with us?

964
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:26,420
Don't worry

965
00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:27,740
Tomorrow

966
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:30,760
These creature'll be sent to the whole world

967
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:34,380
That day will be revolutionary day that supposed to be celebrated

968
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:38,090
Because I'll invite you to see

969
00:59:38,190 --> 00:59:39,100
Cis!

970
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:41,240
I will not let you do this

971
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:43,770
For time being, please stay in the cell

972
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:45,790
Let us go!

973
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:48,070
Have a rest tonight

974
00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:57,680
Annoying little kid

975
00:59:58,110 --> 01:00:00,430
Hey, what cell is this?

976
01:00:00,550 --> 01:00:01,370
Wait!

977
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,140
Giant

978
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:06,940
Are you okay?

979
01:00:07,310 --> 01:00:08,700
This area is guarded by electricity

980
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:12,770
Doraemon, what should we do?

981
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:15,650
Nobi, we have to save Dolphin

982
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:19,050
Jack, what about dad?

983
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:21,720
Better if we find a way to loose ourself

984
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:25,460
What if the creatures has been shipped to entire world?

985
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:26,810
True...

986
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:28,200
Don't worry

987
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:30,620
There's still time

988
01:00:31,390 --> 01:00:33,480
The least thing that we need is

989
01:00:33,510 --> 01:00:36,000
if our heart is not calm

990
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:39,040
Don't worry, wait till opportunity come

991
01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:44,600
A way out!

992
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:45,530
We're safe

993
01:00:45,770 --> 01:00:47,220
We found the exit

994
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:54,870
What's this?

995
01:01:07,990 --> 01:01:09,470
Accidentally...

996
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:15,750
You're stealing people's clothes, Gonzales

997
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:18,350
Not stealing, just changing

998
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:21,340
So? Looks good, ey?

999
01:01:22,110 --> 01:01:22,800
What're you doing?

1000
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:24,680
Er..this..

1001
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:27,760
Oh, another one appeared, huh

1002
01:01:27,890 --> 01:01:28,440
Yes

1003
01:01:28,670 --> 01:01:30,930
Keep in the cell first

1004
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:32,510
Cell?

1005
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:33,970
Okay

1006
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:36,970
Wait!

1007
01:01:36,990 --> 01:01:37,740
Yes?

1008
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:39,690
Waht is it?

1009
01:01:40,210 --> 01:01:41,960
The cell is there

1010
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:43,810
Oh there...

1011
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:44,760
Wait...wait...

1012
01:01:52,810 --> 01:01:54,410
Lock him in the 2nd cell

1013
01:01:55,590 --> 01:01:57,970
What happened actually?

1014
01:01:58,320 --> 01:01:59,130
Pancho

1015
01:02:00,990 --> 01:02:01,810
Captain

1016
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:03,110
I cannot believe that you're here

1017
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:04,490
Where's Gonzales?

1018
01:02:04,790 --> 01:02:08,030
Captain, are you guys okay?

1019
01:02:08,410 --> 01:02:09,120
Wait!

1020
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:11,020
Push the button over there

1021
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:14,060
Now it's okay

1022
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:15,110
Captain

1023
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:15,670
Everyone

1024
01:02:15,790 --> 01:02:17,450
Thank god

1025
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:21,480
There must be a way from here

1026
01:02:22,050 --> 01:02:23,880
A team go and save the Dolphin

1027
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:25,550
The others rescue our other friends

1028
01:02:25,870 --> 01:02:27,140
So, everyone is divided to 2 groups

1029
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:31,360
Jack, I'll save your dad for sure

1030
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:33,540
Nobita, I leave Jack to you

1031
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:35,570
Okay, trust me

1032
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:37,670
Nobita, are able to?

1033
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:39,890
Jack, I leave you Nobita

1034
01:02:40,330 --> 01:02:40,920
Okay

1035
01:02:41,270 --> 01:02:42,700
You look calm

1036
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:44,640
I'm no longer the old me

1037
01:02:46,450 --> 01:02:48,380
Okay, let's move

1038
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,220
We meet at the back of this island

1039
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:51,340
Okay

1040
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:53,940
Let's go

1041
01:02:58,710 --> 01:02:59,680
If you want to go down

1042
01:02:59,870 --> 01:03:01,520
Go through that door

1043
01:03:01,590 --> 01:03:02,700
Lift, ey?

1044
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:11,680
Don't know

1045
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:12,890
Thank god

1046
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:15,280
Its a monitor room

1047
01:03:15,490 --> 01:03:18,090
Who knows if we could see Professor Krone's room

1048
01:03:18,810 --> 01:03:20,240
Let's just try it first

1049
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:23,440
What's this ??? for?

1050
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:26,890
There's supposed to be a map

1051
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:33,280
Something's moving

1052
01:03:42,590 --> 01:03:43,370
Jack

1053
01:03:44,050 --> 01:03:44,940
Nobi

1054
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:45,840
Jack

1055
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:52,920
Nobi

1056
01:03:57,780 --> 01:03:59,760
You're great, Nobita

1057
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:00,940
Jack, hurry

1058
01:04:03,250 --> 01:04:06,200
Truly different from the old Nobita

1059
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:07,010
True, right?

1060
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:09,540
But it's scary...

1061
01:04:13,810 --> 01:04:16,990
Then we'll be able to know every corner of this place

1062
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:06,290
What is it?

1063
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:07,570
Change of shift

1064
01:05:07,710 --> 01:05:08,530
Change of shift?

1065
01:05:08,830 --> 01:05:09,850
I didn't know

1066
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:10,960
Oh, really?

1067
01:05:10,970 --> 01:05:11,700
You?

1068
01:05:15,150 --> 01:05:16,180
here's the keys

1069
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:20,360
Everyone, I come to save you all

1070
01:05:25,070 --> 01:05:26,300
Everyone, please stay calm

1071
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:28,590
It'll be a problem when they know

1072
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:29,620
Betty

1073
01:05:31,270 --> 01:05:33,380
Dad...dad...

1074
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:35,410
Betty

1075
01:05:35,420 --> 01:05:36,220
Dad....

1076
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:39,380
Sorry for making you feel worry

1077
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:41,750
Dad, Jack's safe too

1078
01:05:41,990 --> 01:05:43,660
You've met?

1079
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,180
Colt

1080
01:05:46,050 --> 01:05:48,230
Kid, thanks for everything

1081
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:51,880
Captain Kid, we've found the key for the chain

1082
01:05:54,510 --> 01:05:55,750
Here

1083
01:05:55,970 --> 01:05:58,070
Professor Krone's lab

1084
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:02,220
Doraemon, isn't this our start place?

1085
01:06:02,370 --> 01:06:05,650
True, I don't realize it

1086
01:06:10,690 --> 01:06:12,770
When I use dolphin's brain

1087
01:06:12,770 --> 01:06:14,350
I would've being able to create

1088
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:17,610
War creature better than Leviathan

1089
01:06:18,270 --> 01:06:20,740
Should be combined with what, ey?

1090
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:23,130
This or that one?

1091
01:06:24,390 --> 01:06:27,310
With dolphin's soft skin, then...

1092
01:06:29,030 --> 01:06:30,840
You really are smart

1093
01:06:30,890 --> 01:06:32,950
you know what I'm going to do ey

1094
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:35,940
Just hang in there

1095
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:42,700
This is my stuff

1096
01:06:42,890 --> 01:06:44,160
And Captain Kid's stuff too

1097
01:06:44,330 --> 01:06:46,470
It's being kept by Professor Krone

1098
01:06:46,580 --> 01:06:48,300
What about this one?

1099
01:06:49,190 --> 01:06:50,540
A crab-dolphin

1100
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:53,990
I will not let you do that, Professor Krone

1101
01:06:54,370 --> 01:06:55,680
Who're you?

1102
01:06:55,860 --> 01:06:56,990
Let Dolphin go!

1103
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,720
I will not let you transform it

1104
01:06:58,920 --> 01:06:59,900
What're you saying?

1105
01:06:59,910 --> 01:07:01,420
???

1106
01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:02,980
I will not let it go

1107
01:07:08,420 --> 01:07:10,750
What're you doing?

1108
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:12,070
Unforgiven

1109
01:07:12,380 --> 01:07:13,710
To use Earth organism,

1110
01:07:13,970 --> 01:07:16,530
and change it into human weapon,

1111
01:07:16,710 --> 01:07:18,010
I will not forgive you

1112
01:07:18,050 --> 01:07:19,710
What you're doing is wrong

1113
01:07:19,830 --> 01:07:21,450
Release Dolphin back to the sea

1114
01:07:21,630 --> 01:07:23,650
Release the dolphin

1115
01:07:24,430 --> 01:07:34,560
Abnormal energy spike detected

1116
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:36,700
Where's the place?

1117
01:07:36,870 --> 01:07:37,990
Transformation room

1118
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,890
Professor Krone's lab

1119
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:41,370
Lab?

1120
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,440
Professor Krone, what happen?

1121
01:07:44,550 --> 01:07:47,330
The dolphin has been stolen by the rakoon

1122
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:50,830
And they destroyes all my programs

1123
01:07:54,610 --> 01:07:55,430
Hurry

1124
01:07:56,990 --> 01:07:59,660
I found a water tunnel that lead to the back of the island

1125
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:03,350
Dolphin, are you okay?

1126
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:05,200
We need to put it in water, hurry

1127
01:08:05,410 --> 01:08:07,670
This lift's too slow

1128
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:10,790
Destroy the protection barrier

1129
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:12,750
So that the time police'll be able to enter

1130
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:15,340
I thought so too

1131
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:17,040
What is it?

1132
01:08:17,130 --> 01:08:18,840
Dolphin?

1133
01:08:20,940 --> 01:08:22,330
Mas...Master Kasshu...

1134
01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:24,460
All the pirates

1135
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:26,300
Everyone have run away

1136
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:27,830
What're you saying?

1137
01:08:28,290 --> 01:08:29,600
Shit!

1138
01:08:30,810 --> 01:08:32,620
I looked down on that rakoon

1139
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:35,560
Then I have to act faster

1140
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:50,030
Captain, the way out. We're on the seaside

1141
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:52,350
True

1142
01:09:09,470 --> 01:09:10,390
Papa

1143
01:09:11,830 --> 01:09:12,950
Jack

1144
01:09:14,430 --> 01:09:15,400
Papa

1145
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:17,170
You're safe

1146
01:09:17,530 --> 01:09:19,940
Papa, I'm not crying

1147
01:09:20,070 --> 01:09:21,650
I've heard it from Betty

1148
01:09:21,810 --> 01:09:23,460
You did great, Jack

1149
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:25,670
All of you have worked hard

1150
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:28,630
Papa, Nobita is so brave

1151
01:09:29,070 --> 01:09:30,770
Nobita, really?

1152
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:31,980
I've told you

1153
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:33,970
I'm not the same as before

1154
01:09:34,070 --> 01:09:36,860
Don't tell me you're pretending to be a brother just in front of Jack

1155
01:09:36,980 --> 01:09:38,450
No...

1156
01:09:38,670 --> 01:09:42,890
Okay, let's leave this creepy island

1157
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:46,550
We cannot go home just yet

1158
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:47,950
why?

1159
01:09:48,470 --> 01:09:50,630
We cannot leave it like that

1160
01:09:51,830 --> 01:09:54,750
Suneo, you want to let Master Kasshu's treachery?

1161
01:09:55,050 --> 01:09:56,620
The problem could be worsen

1162
01:09:58,210 --> 01:09:59,090
True

1163
01:09:59,130 --> 01:10:01,420
Doraemon, we're going to stay

1164
01:10:01,790 --> 01:10:04,060
Papa, I want to stay with Nobita

1165
01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:05,190
Me too

1166
01:10:05,670 --> 01:10:08,820
Of course we'll pay back their deed, ey Kid?

1167
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:12,310
And, if pirates going home empty handed
would be embarassing

1168
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:15,280
True, they did this to us

1169
01:10:15,310 --> 01:10:16,690
Unforgivable

1170
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:17,770
True

1171
01:10:17,930 --> 01:10:18,790
I understand

1172
01:10:18,990 --> 01:10:20,990
We have pirates' spirit too then

1173
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:22,750
Right, everyone?

1174
01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:24,740
Right

1175
01:10:26,790 --> 01:10:28,580
Thank you, everyone

1176
01:10:28,590 --> 01:10:30,220
Takeshi, don't cry

1177
01:10:30,230 --> 01:10:32,020
I'm not crying

1178
01:10:32,150 --> 01:10:34,280
My eyes are just sweating

1179
01:10:36,490 --> 01:10:38,410
Okay, let's move

1180
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:42,230
Nobita and I

1181
01:10:42,310 --> 01:10:44,290
are going to the mountain past the protection barrier

1182
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:49,230
I hope you can prevent them from loading the creature into the ship

1183
01:10:49,540 --> 01:10:50,550
Leave it to us

1184
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:53,810
Take this gadget, who knows if they're any use

1185
01:10:54,090 --> 01:10:55,820
Let's move

1186
01:10:55,830 --> 01:10:57,480
Yes

1187
01:11:03,370 --> 01:11:04,420
hurry up

1188
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:07,610
Load the creature into the ship, hurry

1189
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:08,870
Hurry

1190
01:11:24,730 --> 01:11:27,070
What is this? Why are you so slow?

1191
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:29,880
We're the only one working, a bit tired

1192
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:33,630
At this moment, the pirates..

1193
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,850
No...impossible

1194
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:46,770
Let's get the ship back

1195
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:49,640
Let them see how pirates deal with war

1196
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:51,980
Let's go

1197
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:09,870
You...

1198
01:12:15,410 --> 01:12:17,300
Everything is useless

1199
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:42,800
You'll see the power of transformation creature

1200
01:12:56,030 --> 01:12:57,620
Stop all this!

1201
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:09,660
What is that? Tiger?

1202
01:13:09,790 --> 01:13:11,200
No, an elephant

1203
01:13:11,290 --> 01:13:13,310
Tiger-elephant?

1204
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:19,830
Oh yes, Momotaro Snack

1205
01:13:20,410 --> 01:13:21,780
As long it eat it,

1206
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:23,850
it'll follow my instruction

1207
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:25,240
Leave it to me

1208
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:26,920
Tiger-elephant, wait!

1209
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:28,810
Let's fight

1210
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:30,700
Now!

1211
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:35,600
It worked!

1212
01:13:35,830 --> 01:13:37,960
Now, go back to your cage slowly

1213
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:40,330
What happened?

1214
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:47,330
This isn't Momotaro's, this is Butt's

1215
01:13:47,390 --> 01:13:48,710
What to do?

1216
01:13:49,110 --> 01:13:49,880
Run!

1217
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:51,000
Wait, Suneo

1218
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:53,880
Tiger-elephant look a bit weird

1219
01:13:59,370 --> 01:14:00,990
Looks like its stomach is hurt

1220
01:14:01,210 --> 01:14:05,070
Butt's Snack is actually a laxative

1221
01:14:10,250 --> 01:14:11,630
Its going to to the toilet

1222
01:14:13,540 --> 01:14:14,740
What about this one?

1223
01:14:19,940 --> 01:14:20,900
What's that?

1224
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:27,010
Combination of crocodile and hippo

1225
01:14:34,130 --> 01:14:35,340
Run!

1226
01:14:52,890 --> 01:14:54,040
Amazing...

1227
01:14:58,100 --> 01:14:59,630
So big

1228
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:01,450
Maybe it's fainted

1229
01:15:02,570 --> 01:15:03,640
Stupid animal

1230
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:08,370
~Unlive Hynoptic Megaphone~

1231
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:12,040
Rock, you're a giant rock monster

1232
01:15:15,670 --> 01:15:18,540
Rock monster, beat it!

1233
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:30,260
Fight, rock monster!

1234
01:15:30,270 --> 01:15:32,680
Fight!

1235
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:34,830
Fight, just a bit more

1236
01:15:36,130 --> 01:15:36,670
Yes

1237
01:15:36,270 --> 01:15:37,750
Fight, Nobita

1238
01:15:39,590 --> 01:15:41,110
We reach the top, at last

1239
01:15:41,590 --> 01:15:42,590
Not yet

1240
01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:44,340
Wha? Not yet?

1241
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:49,650
Then, let's use Jack's Bean

1242
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:51,160
Let's go

1243
01:15:51,190 --> 01:15:51,870
Yes

1244
01:16:11,010 --> 01:16:11,790
This is the place

1245
01:16:19,510 --> 01:16:22,080
Fight

1246
01:16:22,090 --> 01:16:26,570
Fight, rock monster, beat it

1247
01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:27,790
Good luck

1248
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:30,020
Okay, I'll give some spirit

1249
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:32,460
~Karaoke's Microphone~

1250
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:35,980
I want to sing, rock monster

1251
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:44,130
Giant

1252
01:16:44,970 --> 01:16:46,150
You beat it

1253
01:16:50,190 --> 01:16:51,950
Because of my singing?

1254
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:53,250
Looks like it

1255
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:55,760
The song from Takeshi, truly amazing

1256
01:16:56,270 --> 01:16:58,290
No...it's nothing...

1257
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:02,390
What else this time?

1258
01:17:11,230 --> 01:17:13,730
Bring the kids up the ship

1259
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:15,720
Fall the rope, hurry

1260
01:17:15,730 --> 01:17:16,480
Hurry

1261
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:28,430
Jack, Betty

1262
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:29,350
Are you okay?

1263
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:34,750
Leviathan?

1264
01:17:37,150 --> 01:17:38,530
It's heading this way

1265
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,140
Thanks, Dolphin

1266
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:56,180
I brought some friends to help

1267
01:17:56,210 --> 01:17:58,070
Dolphin, you can talk?

1268
01:17:58,300 --> 01:17:59,870
I'm using telepathy

1269
01:18:00,210 --> 01:18:02,020
Shizuka, hurry

1270
01:18:02,020 --> 01:18:03,080
Dolphin, hurry

1271
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:04,050
Hurry... Hurry...

1272
01:18:05,540 --> 01:18:06,210
Dolphin

1273
01:18:07,890 --> 01:18:10,650
Shizuka, hold tight

1274
01:18:17,530 --> 01:18:18,090
We're going up

1275
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:28,920
Dolphin

1276
01:18:29,290 --> 01:18:31,160
Shizuka, are you okay?

1277
01:18:31,470 --> 01:18:32,470
Okay...

1278
01:18:32,510 --> 01:18:33,970
I can hear Dolphin's voice

1279
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:35,290
Telepathy!

1280
01:18:35,660 --> 01:18:37,290
Let's get Dolphin to the sea

1281
01:18:37,490 --> 01:18:38,310
Wait!

1282
01:18:38,610 --> 01:18:39,490
Please bring me...

1283
01:18:39,740 --> 01:18:42,280
...into the cockpit

1284
01:18:42,390 --> 01:18:43,290
Dolphin

1285
01:18:43,450 --> 01:18:46,950
Is there anyone else know how to stop Leviathan?

1286
01:18:48,250 --> 01:18:49,000
Hurry!

1287
01:18:49,490 --> 01:18:51,120
Let's go, Nobita

1288
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:54,520
Doraemon

1289
01:18:55,830 --> 01:18:57,100
Hold tight

1290
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:08,270
We're safe

1291
01:19:08,550 --> 01:19:12,260
I don't expect Kasshu to be here

1292
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:15,620
Okay, we turn off the protection barrier, hurry

1293
01:19:15,780 --> 01:19:16,420
Em!

1294
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:19,880
On this ship, there're anaesthetic cannon

1295
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:22,400
point it towards Leviathan

1296
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:25,340
I don't understand

1297
01:19:25,620 --> 01:19:27,820
I never use use this controller

1298
01:19:27,890 --> 01:19:30,430
Just pretend that you're playing remote control game

1299
01:19:30,990 --> 01:19:32,620
This is totally different

1300
01:19:32,950 --> 01:19:34,800
Fight, Suneo

1301
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:36,610
Do as I say

1302
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:45,650
Okay

1303
01:19:45,860 --> 01:19:47,820
First, push the blue button

1304
01:19:49,310 --> 01:19:51,630
Then lower down the lever on the right

1305
01:19:56,150 --> 01:19:58,130
It's moving

1306
01:19:58,460 --> 01:19:59,580
You did it, Suneo

1307
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:00,700
Cool!

1308
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,610
Low down the left lever

1309
01:20:02,860 --> 01:20:03,760
Okay

1310
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:12,890
Suneo great... Great~

1311
01:20:13,050 --> 01:20:14,520
Next, just wait for it to appear

1312
01:20:14,540 --> 01:20:15,780
only then shoot it with the anaesthetic bullet

1313
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:16,970
Okay

1314
01:20:21,710 --> 01:20:23,790
Done, there supposed to be no more problem

1315
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:25,780
We did it, Doraemon

1316
01:20:25,820 --> 01:20:30,410
With this, time police'll be able to find this island

1317
01:20:33,420 --> 01:20:34,370
It appear

1318
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:40,010
Now!

1319
01:20:54,030 --> 01:20:55,500
We did it!

1320
01:20:55,110 --> 01:20:56,220
Strike!

1321
01:20:56,230 --> 01:20:57,330
Did it!

1322
01:20:57,340 --> 01:20:59,000
You're great, Suneo

1323
01:20:59,060 --> 01:21:00,740
I just beat it!

1324
01:21:01,110 --> 01:21:03,630
This is Dolphin, this is Dolphin

1325
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:09,300
17th century, Carribean Island, Tomos Island

1326
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:13,180
The protection barrier has been deactivated

1327
01:21:13,270 --> 01:21:15,320
Doraemon, let's tell the others, hurry

1328
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:16,290
Okay

1329
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:18,930
I will not let you do it

1330
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:21,840
Wait!

1331
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,350
Let me go! Let me go

1332
01:21:28,690 --> 01:21:30,710
How is this possible?

1333
01:21:42,250 --> 01:21:43,110
Let me go

1334
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:56,190
Nobi!

1335
01:22:03,610 --> 01:22:04,990
Doraemon!

1336
01:22:08,660 --> 01:22:11,390
This is inside of Leviathan's stomach

1337
01:22:12,730 --> 01:22:15,330
We'll be digested

1338
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:17,060
I don't have a problem

1339
01:22:17,410 --> 01:22:18,250
Why?

1340
01:22:18,850 --> 01:22:21,300
Because I'm a robot. I will not be digested

1341
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:24,070
I'll move out together with the feces

1342
01:22:24,210 --> 01:22:26,590
I'm begging you, I'll pay you as much as you please

1343
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:27,510
Please help me

1344
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:28,770
No way

1345
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:31,000
Before my dreams come true, I don't want to die

1346
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:34,780
Selling life creature isn't a dream!

1347
01:22:34,940 --> 01:22:35,790
It's a dream!

1348
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:36,950
Not a dream!

1349
01:22:37,090 --> 01:22:38,160
It's a dream!

1350
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:39,330
Not a dream!

1351
01:22:39,370 --> 01:22:40,700
Dream!

1352
01:22:40,710 --> 01:22:42,260
Not a dream!

1353
01:22:47,170 --> 01:22:48,730
Dream's Checker!

1354
01:22:54,940 --> 01:22:56,390
Wha...What's happening?

1355
01:22:56,530 --> 01:22:58,700
Oh, who knows if we tiggle its stomach

1356
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:00,170
we might be able to go out

1357
01:23:00,230 --> 01:23:00,820
Okay

1358
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:08,110
Doraemon

1359
01:23:08,170 --> 01:23:09,570
Nobita

1360
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:11,340
Help me

1361
01:23:11,930 --> 01:23:13,700
You asshole!

1362
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:16,880
What?

1363
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:27,970
It'll be a problem if it could break the wall

1364
01:23:30,310 --> 01:23:31,580
When the wall collapse,

1365
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:33,110
the sea water'll be flooded in here

1366
01:23:49,310 --> 01:23:50,900
We'll drown

1367
01:23:53,870 --> 01:23:55,220
Doraemon, what now?

1368
01:23:55,460 --> 01:23:56,920
Everyone, jump!

1369
01:23:57,110 --> 01:23:57,850
Dolphin

1370
01:23:58,640 --> 01:23:59,840
I've called all my friends

1371
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:01,240
Let's get out, hurry

1372
01:24:06,710 --> 01:24:07,530
Let's go

1373
01:24:11,950 --> 01:24:13,260
Nobi, hurry

1374
01:24:16,910 --> 01:24:18,990
Okay, take a deep breath

1375
01:24:19,750 --> 01:24:20,500
Let's move

1376
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:39,890
Everyone, okay?

1377
01:24:40,060 --> 01:24:42,230
If Nobita's okay, we'll be okay too

1378
01:24:42,470 --> 01:24:44,280
What a saying..

1379
01:24:45,220 --> 01:24:46,440
What esle this time?

1380
01:24:56,010 --> 01:24:58,010
Time police's team!

1381
01:25:06,530 --> 01:25:08,680
Betty, our ship!

1382
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:14,700
Thank you, this is all thanks to you

1383
01:25:15,230 --> 01:25:17,280
Because I didn't know this place's path

1384
01:25:17,290 --> 01:25:18,540
So, I spent so many time

1385
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:22,200
I cannot believe Dolphin is a time police

1386
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:23,900
Nothing can be done

1387
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:26,020
Hiding this from you guys, sorry

1388
01:25:26,550 --> 01:25:29,070
What'll happen to the transformation creature?

1389
01:25:29,140 --> 01:25:31,680
They'll be restored to its original form

1390
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:34,500
But one's missing

1391
01:25:34,570 --> 01:25:36,540
Leviathan?

1392
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,770
Don't worry

1393
01:25:37,910 --> 01:25:41,170
As long as its not being control,
it will not be a beast

1394
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:42,650
From now on

1395
01:25:42,810 --> 01:25:45,010
It might be live as a legend monster

1396
01:25:45,030 --> 01:25:46,120
Thank god

1397
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:48,790
Then, we should go back too

1398
01:25:48,820 --> 01:25:49,600
Em

1399
01:25:49,950 --> 01:25:51,770
Dolphin, sayonara

1400
01:25:52,210 --> 01:25:53,040
Sayonara

1401
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:54,380
Thanks for the help

1402
01:25:54,730 --> 01:25:56,450
Keep fighting, ey

1403
01:25:56,730 --> 01:25:57,730
Dolphin

1404
01:26:04,970 --> 01:26:07,980
Captain's not returning yet

1405
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:11,350
Papa! Dad...!

1406
01:26:14,630 --> 01:26:18,500
Hey, we got the treasures

1407
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:25,100
Sorry if we cause any trouble

1408
01:26:25,350 --> 01:26:27,050
It is time for us to be separated, Jack

1409
01:26:27,230 --> 01:26:28,250
Nobi

1410
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:29,880
Don't cry

1411
01:26:30,010 --> 01:26:31,960
If you cry, you can't be a great pirate

1412
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:33,790
I won't cry

1413
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:35,080
Nobi too

1414
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:37,080
I'm not crying...

1415
01:26:37,740 --> 01:26:40,690
My eyes are just sweating

1416
01:26:41,010 --> 01:26:44,150
Takeshi, stay here, we'll be pirates together

1417
01:26:44,260 --> 01:26:45,720
That's not possible

1418
01:26:45,730 --> 01:26:47,390
Mom'll be worried

1419
01:26:47,730 --> 01:26:50,050
But I really want to hear you singing...

1420
01:26:50,130 --> 01:26:52,840
Really? Then I'll stay here

1421
01:26:52,860 --> 01:26:54,370
Giant, mistaken, mistaken

1422
01:26:55,300 --> 01:26:57,660
If that happen

1423
01:26:57,670 --> 01:26:58,770
A real chaos could occur on the seas

1424
01:27:05,980 --> 01:27:08,440
Sayonara

1425
01:27:11,950 --> 01:27:13,660
Sayonara, Takeshi

1426
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:16,690
Sayonara Nobi, Dolphin

1427
01:27:16,820 --> 01:27:18,510
Sayonara

1428
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:22,450
Let's go! Release the sail!

1429
01:27:27,580 --> 01:27:33,070
Till we meet again, Captain Doraemon
