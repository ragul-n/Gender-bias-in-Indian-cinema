1
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:32,208
One, two...

2
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:36,666
-Another round, please!
-We missed this one!

3
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,833
Smile please.

4
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:39,458
Very good.

5
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,291
Very good.

6
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:44,958
Kaajal.

7
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:46,500
Dolly?

8
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:47,875
Where are you?

9
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:49,916
-Dolly!
-Kaajal!

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,833
-I found you!
-Where?

11
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:52,750
Here!

12
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:57,583
Pappu, hurry up!

13
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:58,958
Give that to me.

14
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:01,791
If you're too naughty, Mom will run away!

15
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:04,791
Come on. Amit, go pay!

16
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:08,708
Your sister Dolly is such a spendthrift!

17
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:11,750
You don't look like Empress Mumtaz!

18
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:13,541
And you never will.

19
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:16,083
Bharat, it's just a costume.
Leave him alone.

20
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:17,041
Come on.

21
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,583
Kaajal, join us.

22
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:26,166
-Come on, Aunt.
-Come.

23
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:29,333
We need the princess in the picture.

24
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:32,541
Ready?

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,458
One, two, three.

26
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:47,458
Kaajal!

27
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:53,041
I'm so glad you've come
to live with us in Noida.

28
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:56,166
Now whatever happens, I am there for you.

29
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:00,958
There is something, Dolly.

30
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:03,000
-Shall I tell you?
-Yeah.

31
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,000
Your husband--

32
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:11,791
Amit keeps hovering around me...

33
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:14,041
trying to touch me.

34
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:17,833
Kaajal, he's your brother-in-law.

35
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:19,250
He cares about you.

36
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:21,625
He wants to have sex with me.

37
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:27,291
-Did you hear me?
-What?

38
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:30,208
Your husband wants to have sex with me!

39
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,250
What? Have you lost your mind?

40
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:38,000
Your hormones are raging.

41
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:40,208
Perhaps, you're attracted to him.

42
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:42,208
Maybe you want to sleep with him.

43
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:43,500
-What?
-It's natural.

44
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,583
You're young.
That's why you're confused.

45
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:52,250
But try not to be confused.
Or you won't survive in this city.

46
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:54,208
Look!

47
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:56,875
Bubbles!

48
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,583
-Started?
-Whoa!

49
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:06,083
Come on. Let's get in fast.

50
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,166
Our house is up in the sky!

51
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,208
You'll be able to see right up to Delhi.

52
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,458
Please, come.

53
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:32,458
Papa, I can't see the cricket ground.

54
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:36,250
You can see everything from the roof.
Look, it's almost ready.

55
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,708
There will be a door here.

56
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,375
And see...

57
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:44,125
-the windows are almost done.
-Oh, they are!

58
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:46,833
Here's the balcony.
The air's so fresh!

59
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,000
So, yes.

60
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:59,083
You can't delay
your installment, Mr. Yadav.

61
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,500
It's been a year...

62
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:02,500
the building is far from ready.

63
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,083
The delay is costing me.

64
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,416
Don't worry.
It'll be ready soon.

65
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,666
I love this fancy tap!

66
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,125
It's the best quality!

67
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:16,291
Delays do happen, right?

68
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,666
-They do.
-Is this tap going to cost me extra?

69
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,375
Not at all, Mr. Yadav.

70
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,500
Don't worry, Mr. Suresh.

71
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,666
We'll pay the rest this month.

72
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,458
Sure, take your time.
But hurry up.

73
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:30,208
I'll take a loan.

74
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,416
There's a queue.

75
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,416
Who comes house-hunting
early in the morning?

76
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:01,416
Sorry.

77
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,708
Bloody witch!

78
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,375
Sorry.

79
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:18,875
-Is my room confirmed?
-Bed

80
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,625
-Bedroom?
-Not room, only bed.

81
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:31,166
Thank God, at least I'll have my own bed.

82
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,666
Pay an advance for two months,

83
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,125
or nothing's confirmed.

84
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,791
Stop daydreaming.

85
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:42,541
Taj Mahal!

86
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:44,958
Light.

87
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:48,250
-Thank you.
-We missed you a lot, Mrs. Yadav.

88
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,250
Yes, but I don't like it.

89
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,083
I've seen the Taj Mahal so many times.

90
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:54,000
It's boring.

91
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:56,916
We also visit often.

92
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,541
Taste these sweets.

93
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:02,166
From Agra's famous shop,
Panchi Petha.

94
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,166
Panchi Petha.

95
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,166
How was your weekend, Mrs. Yadav?

96
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,291
It was fantastic.

97
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,375
I went to the amusement park
with my family.

98
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:12,583
-Really?
-Yes.

99
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:14,041
It was fun.

100
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:22,416
-Mrs. Yadav.
-Yes?

101
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,083
-Tea.
-Oh, yes.

102
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:37,916
{\an8}Mr. Pandey.

103
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,041
I need a loan.
A small one.

104
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,916
You work for fun, right?

105
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,666
Why do you need a loan?

106
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,375
Just wanted a new car.

107
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:51,583
Mrs. Yadav,

108
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,958
you know
we don't give loans.

109
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:56,500
Tea?

110
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:13,291
Sir, I need an advance.

111
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,750
I need to pay for a bed space.

112
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,750
Get back to your work.

113
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,208
Forget about the advance.

114
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:48,541
You've to pay
for every defective piece.

115
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:49,458
Sorry, sir.

116
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:52,833
It was a mistake.
Won't happen again, sir.

117
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,541
Please don't cut my salary.
I need the money.

118
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:56,875
Be grateful...

119
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,208
you're working in a factory,
not milking cows.

120
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:21,916
-Mr. Gippi!
-What?

121
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,625
I am a factory worker, not your slave.

122
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:40,208
The food is still not here!

123
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:41,500
We're having guests over.

124
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,208
-Mom!
-I can't take Pappu along.

125
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,666
Mom!
I can't take Pappu along.

126
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,250
-I'm not going with him.
-What happened?

127
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:50,416
Oh, no! Go bring the antiseptic.

128
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,000
Mrs. Yadav?
Your order from Ippy.

129
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:58,583
-Two hours late! I'm so mad!
-I'm sorry.

130
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,208
It won't happen again.

131
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,583
I'm never ordering
from Ippy again.

132
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:05,083
-What's your name?
-Osman Ansari.

133
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,791
I'm going to complain against you.

134
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,333
Get the food.

135
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:11,750
The guests will be arriving in an hour.

136
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,500
-Keep it here.
-Sorry, madam.

137
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:14,583
It's leaking.

138
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:18,666
Please don't complain against me.
I'm a student. I need this job.

139
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,333
Delivery boys can't afford to be late.

140
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:23,541
Let me help you.

141
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,625
Bring the food inside.
The table's getting dirty.

142
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,666
Yes.

143
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:32,000
In my new house, I'll hire a cook.

144
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:33,833
Here.

145
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:36,083
We'll also get an AC there.

146
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:37,708
There's no space here.

147
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:40,291
Mom, you've ordered food?

148
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,916
Bharat, go take a shower
and do your homework.

149
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,916
Where's the cut?

150
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,791
It'll be fine.

151
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,208
Will you play with my new dolls?

152
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:00,875
Sure.

153
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:03,125
No...

154
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,750
You're done, right?

155
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:07,541
Thank you.

156
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:10,208
Sorry, I was late, ma'am.

157
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:13,375
When you rate me,

158
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,083
please give me five stars.

159
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,500
You're rather confident!

160
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:29,291
-Did you want water?
-No, ma'am.

161
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,041
Keep ordering from Ippy.

162
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:32,666
And...

163
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:34,291
five stars...

164
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,916
Where are your emerald earrings?

165
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:24,833
Safe in the bank.

166
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:27,708
Don't these look good?

167
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,625
Where did you get them?

168
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,125
Don't worry.

169
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,250
They're fake.

170
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,000
Listen...

171
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,958
Did your office approve the loan?

172
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,083
They will.

173
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:47,875
Lovely.

174
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:49,958
I'll go make a drink.

175
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:52,291
We'll get an AC in our new house.

176
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:54,458
There's no power backup here.

177
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,500
When are you moving?

178
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:59,250
Luxurious buildings take time.

179
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,333
It already has running water,

180
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,958
a modular kitchen, and fancy taps!

181
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:05,916
-Wow.
-Why don't you buy one?

182
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,333
We already own a home.
Paying for a new one is impossible.

183
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,916
Our home was given to you as a dowry.

184
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,833
Your father contributed.
It's not a dowry.

185
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:18,583
Dolly's father gifted us this furniture.
Can't call it a dowry.

186
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:21,083
Gift or dowry, it's the same.

187
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,833
We women love to protest!

188
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:27,375
Have some spring rolls, Mrs. Kumar.

189
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:30,125
-Text me the recipe.
-Sure--

190
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:32,291
But Mom ordered the food--

191
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:35,416
Bharat, go look after your friends.

192
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,750
-But, Mom--
-Bharat, go inside.

193
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,875
Meet Mr. & Mrs. Kumar.

194
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,250
And Mr. & Mrs. Chatterjee.
I work with them.

195
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,458
And this is Kaajal.

196
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,333
My cousin.

197
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:54,333
Kaajal, what are you doing in Noida?

198
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,125
She works at Pritam Shoes.
In business development.

199
00:13:57,208 --> 00:14:00,166
Looks like you're giving
your brother-in-law a hard time!

200
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:07,666
I'm not well, I'm going in.

201
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,208
-What happened?
-Yes, get some rest.

202
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,500
She could've stayed for a bit.

203
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,833
-Sehwag aced it in the cricket match.
-He was Man of the Match?

204
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:17,000
Yes, he was.

205
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:08,291
Stop pretending, Dolly.

206
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,708
I've figured you out.

207
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:11,958
Drink?

208
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:27,541
It was bloody hard to get you that job.

209
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,208
And you quit in a heartbeat.

210
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:30,916
I'm confused, Dolly.

211
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:32,625
That's why.

212
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:35,875
So now?

213
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:40,250
Cheers!

214
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,041
Nancy is cuddling with you in bed.

215
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,083
Are you having fun?

216
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,791
Nancy loves only you.

217
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:21,125
<i>Brajesh, your skin is so soft.</i>

218
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:24,833
<i>And my silky, golden, blond hair...</i>

219
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:29,083
<i>is caressing your soft skin.</i>

220
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:32,125
<i>-Touch me, Nancy.</i>
<i>-Oh, Brajesh!</i>

221
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,416
Keep it,

222
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,750
as a welcome gift.

223
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:47,166
Just focus on your star ratings
and gift sales.

224
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,666
That's it.

225
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,583
Hello.

226
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:20,625
I'm stuck in traffic.
Show me some love.

227
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,333
<i>What's taking you so long?</i>

228
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,416
Hello, this is Kitty.

229
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:36,625
Your new companion...
on the Red Rose Romance app.

230
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,416
Kitty, say "I love you"
and kiss me.

231
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:46,916
Sorry, it's my first time, so--

232
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,958
<i>Say, "I love you."</i>

233
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,750
<i>Come on, Kitty.</i>

234
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:53,166
<i>Say "I love you," dammit!</i>

235
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,083
I love you.

236
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,333
<i>Only night shifts, Mom.</i>

237
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,500
<i>A car will pick me up and drop me off.</i>

238
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,125
<i>The office is fully air-conditioned.</i>

239
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,208
<i>It's freezing.</i>

240
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:26,250
It's way better than the factory!

241
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:27,708
Totally high profile!

242
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:31,041
Thirty thousand a month and free food.

243
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:32,916
I'll send you some money right away.

244
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,458
I'm planning to get my own place.

245
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:45,208
No.

246
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,666
Dolly and Amit take good care of me.

247
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,291
But I don't want to be
a burden on them.

248
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:54,041
Yes, she's here.

249
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:57,625
Hello, Aunt.

250
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:00,250
Kaajal is everyone's darling.

251
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,375
She's my sister.

252
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,541
I don't want her to move out either.

253
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,208
But she's stubborn.

254
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:09,208
She called off her wedding
and came to live with me.

255
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,375
Okay, okay.

256
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,291
Alright, Aunt.
Give my regards to Uncle.

257
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,791
Okay.

258
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:18,125
-Here.
-You've served her so little.

259
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,958
Want her to starve to death?

260
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,166
She'll help herself, she's not a kid.

261
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,500
And why is Kaajal moving out?

262
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,416
We're her family,
she doesn't need to be alone.

263
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,000
She needs a room of her own!

264
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:32,666
Here, she's stuck with Bharat and Pappu.

265
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:36,791
She'll be back
if she doesn't like it there.

266
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,041
Right, Kaajal?

267
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,166
There's no salt in the eggs.

268
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,041
Mr. Pandey.

269
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,791
Can't we get an AC in the office?

270
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:58,208
I agree with Mrs. Yadav.

271
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,708
-It's very hot.
-We can get an AC.

272
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,333
But why suddenly...?

273
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:07,916
Call centers offer amazing facilities.
And you don't need a degree to work there!

274
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,500
I don't care.

275
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,333
And free food.
Continental, Chinese...

276
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:16,583
Also, air-conditioned cars
to ferry them.

277
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:18,291
Wow!

278
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:19,875
You've made lovely tea.

279
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,083
Mr. Pandey.

280
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,250
There's an AC
in the manager's office.

281
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,958
-So why don't we--
-Do you have one in your bedroom?

282
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:29,583
I've one in my bedroom, Mr. Pandey.

283
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:54,750
The bed's gone.
Someone paid an advance.

284
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:57,750
I'll let you know
once another bed is free.

285
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,916
But I need a bed right now, ma'am.

286
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,125
I have nowhere to go.

287
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:07,500
Please, auntie!

288
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:16,625
Stop here.

289
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:42,458
She lost 500 thousand
and her career.

290
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,958
Poor Strawberry.

291
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,333
So, do you plan to stay here?

292
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:57,916
Hopefully, if I get a bed.

293
00:21:58,666 --> 00:21:59,750
Married?

294
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:03,833
Surrogate?
Or here for an operation?

295
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:07,416
I just need a bed...
that's it.

296
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,083
To the left.

297
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:49,875
Over there?

298
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:51,916
Mind the curtain.

299
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,666
Thanks.

300
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,375
-Thanks for the help.
-It's okay.

301
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:02,875
I'll get going, Mrs. Yadav.

302
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:08,416
-I guess you have college.
-I can wait for the AC to be fixed.

303
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:10,958
-Yeah, the AC...
-Yeah...

304
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:19,541
No...

305
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:21,500
-No.
-Have some.

306
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:22,500
No.

307
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:25,083
Please.

308
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,833
Thank you.

309
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:42,958
The cooling's strong, isn't it?

310
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,875
The cooling's fantastic, isn't it?

311
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:00,416
You waste a lot of money, Dolly.

312
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:03,041
It's rented.

313
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:05,625
And the doctor says...

314
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:08,958
it's best to do it when it's cold.

315
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:11,125
Really? Shall we try?

316
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,708
Do you remember our first time?

317
00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:23,666
It was our honeymoon,
in Mussoorie.

318
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:24,625
I remember.

319
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:26,500
You didn't have a beard.

320
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:28,791
You look like a cleric.

321
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:30,708
I think I look like a hot cricketer!

322
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,583
Guess what?
The loan got approved.

323
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:37,750
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Never got the chance.

324
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:39,333
That's great news!

325
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:47,125
Since we have the AC in our room...

326
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:49,791
let's get the kids to sleep here.

327
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:54,750
Just for tonight.

328
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:19,625
<i>Kitty, my pussy cat.</i>

329
00:25:19,708 --> 00:25:21,666
You like cats?

330
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,166
<i>I love my cat.</i>

331
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:25,250
She's the one I see every day.

332
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:27,416
Don't you meet people?

333
00:25:27,708 --> 00:25:29,083
<i>Only when I have to.</i>

334
00:25:30,166 --> 00:25:32,958
<i>I guess you make good tea.</i>

335
00:25:35,583 --> 00:25:36,833
I guess.

336
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:38,583
I like it.

337
00:25:39,666 --> 00:25:42,750
Make a cup for me too.

338
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,041
<i>Kitty, make me happy.</i>

339
00:25:48,666 --> 00:25:49,541
Happy?

340
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:51,500
Bitch, say something romantic!

341
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:54,000
Hey, mind your language.

342
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:55,625
TALK ABOUT MOVIES

343
00:25:58,375 --> 00:26:00,166
Do you like films?

344
00:26:00,541 --> 00:26:02,541
I used to watch them with my wife.

345
00:26:03,666 --> 00:26:06,583
<i>Sridevi used to be my favorite actress.</i>

346
00:26:08,458 --> 00:26:10,000
<i>Please don't stop talking.</i>

347
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:11,083
<i>Mr. India?</i>

348
00:26:11,583 --> 00:26:13,583
Have you seen Sridevi's film Mr. India?

349
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,333
<i>Kitty, please keep talking.</i>

350
00:26:17,416 --> 00:26:21,875
What else do I say? How about... songs?
Shall I sing you a song?

351
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:26,166
<i>Each breath bursts forth</i>
<i>To share my heart</i>

352
00:26:26,708 --> 00:26:30,125
<i>Like a cloudburst</i>
<i>My pulsating heart</i>

353
00:26:30,416 --> 00:26:33,875
<i>So, here goes...</i>

354
00:26:35,833 --> 00:26:36,666
<i>I...</i>

355
00:26:40,291 --> 00:26:42,625
<i>I love you</i>

356
00:27:11,458 --> 00:27:13,833
Wow! You're a star.

357
00:27:14,708 --> 00:27:16,708
You handled that pervert beautifully.

358
00:27:16,791 --> 00:27:18,500
All the best for many more.

359
00:27:19,458 --> 00:27:20,625
Thank you, sir.

360
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:22,083
Keep it up!

361
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:23,875
Good job.

362
00:27:26,375 --> 00:27:28,375
Hello, this is Kitty...

363
00:27:28,833 --> 00:27:33,041
your new companion
on the Red Rose Romance app.

364
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:10,291
Some people work here
just for the free food.

365
00:28:12,166 --> 00:28:14,916
Eat all you want. In the beginning,
the variety is dazzling.

366
00:28:16,166 --> 00:28:18,250
The sweet and the spicy.

367
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:25,041
And some people have better metabolism.

368
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,625
Good joke.

369
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:28,875
But body shaming is so last century!

370
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:31,291
No, I didn't mean to--

371
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:34,875
Myself, Juhi. Hi.

372
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:38,541
-I am--
-Kaajal.

373
00:28:39,125 --> 00:28:39,958
I know.

374
00:28:40,958 --> 00:28:42,500
You're new in Noida?

375
00:28:43,416 --> 00:28:44,625
Let's party sometime.

376
00:28:46,583 --> 00:28:49,083
-Mom, that's our bus.
-That one? Okay.

377
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:02,916
Get up.

378
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:07,500
-Excuse me?
-This is the girls' bus. Go to your bus.

379
00:29:07,583 --> 00:29:10,458
-Aren't both buses going to the museum?
-What's going on?

380
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:13,000
Ma'am, they are in the girls' bus.

381
00:29:13,458 --> 00:29:15,666
-The boys' bus is the other one.
-Sorry, I...

382
00:29:15,916 --> 00:29:18,291
But we're in the right bus, ma'am.

383
00:29:18,375 --> 00:29:20,250
We're going to the doll museum.

384
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:22,791
-The boys are going to the rail museum.
-Why?

385
00:29:23,416 --> 00:29:24,250
Come on, Pappu.

386
00:29:24,333 --> 00:29:27,208
-No, I want to see the dolls.
-We'll go see the trains.

387
00:29:27,291 --> 00:29:32,416
-No, I want to see the dolls!
-Pappu! No, we'll see the trains!

388
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,458
We'll miss the bus.

389
00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:40,166
Pappu...

390
00:29:40,625 --> 00:29:41,916
the bus will leave!

391
00:29:42,166 --> 00:29:45,416
So what?
I want to go to the doll museum.

392
00:30:12,541 --> 00:30:13,416
What's happening?

393
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:17,583
-That's enough!
-Mom!

394
00:30:17,666 --> 00:30:19,833
-You're playing with dolls!
-Mom!

395
00:30:21,375 --> 00:30:22,500
Mom! But, that's mine!

396
00:30:22,958 --> 00:30:23,875
Mom.

397
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:27,750
<i>"Genetic studies answer many questions.</i>

398
00:30:28,541 --> 00:30:31,833
If the mother has bodily issues,

399
00:30:31,916 --> 00:30:35,458
it can affect
the mind and body of her child."

400
00:30:36,625 --> 00:30:38,083
-What?
-Don't look at me like that.

401
00:30:38,166 --> 00:30:41,083
I'm not saying it.
The health magazine says so.

402
00:30:41,416 --> 00:30:43,250
And the father has no role to play?

403
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:45,083
It's not mentioned here!

404
00:30:48,291 --> 00:30:51,041
Many diseases, one cure.

405
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:04,500

<i>I wanted to be happy.</i>

406

00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:09,375
<i>I couldn't do what mothers do</i>

408
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:12,625

413
00:31:50,791 --> 00:31:51,791
Awesome!

414
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,166
One night out!

415
00:32:01,291 --> 00:32:05,458
DJ Gujjar in the house!

416
00:32:05,541 --> 00:32:07,916
Hey, ladies and gentlemen.

417
00:32:12,708 --> 00:32:14,541
DJ Gujjar Number One!

418
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,416
My Juliet!

419

00:32:34,041 --> 00:32:36,083
<i>I'm the Queen.</i>

00:32:36,166 --> 00:32:37,708
<i>Right answer!</i>

423
00:32:37,791 --> 00:32:40,375

Mad fun, isn't it?

430
00:33:26,333 --> 00:33:29,208
Greater Noida is the new Shanghai!

431
00:33:29,291 --> 00:33:31,291
-I've grammar homework.
-Really?

432
00:33:50,291 --> 00:33:52,416
Still guarding your virginity?

433
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:56,791
Said "I love you" yet?

434
00:33:57,708 --> 00:34:01,166
-People often say it to get sex.
-But DJ has said it to you, right?

435
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:05,333
DJ wears his heart on his sleeve!

436
00:34:06,291 --> 00:34:07,625
Shazia!

437
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,833
I love you!

438
00:34:09,916 --> 00:34:11,625
I love you too, my DJ!

439
00:34:14,375 --> 00:34:15,500
I love you.

440
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:30,166
Five thousand rupees, per piece.

441
00:34:30,875 --> 00:34:34,166
But last time, you gave me 35,000.

442
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,625
The piece is hollow.

443
00:34:35,708 --> 00:34:37,625
If your husband finds out
you're selling your jewelry,

444
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:39,541
you'll be in trouble.

445
00:34:40,833 --> 00:34:41,791
Shut up, Pappu!

446
00:34:53,583 --> 00:34:56,708
If the mister doesn't know, keep selling!
Who cares?

447
00:35:11,875 --> 00:35:13,583
Pack all of it.

448
00:35:17,208 --> 00:35:18,250
Madam?

449
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,833
Osman.

450
00:35:20,625 --> 00:35:22,333
Can I drop you somewhere?

451
00:35:24,916 --> 00:35:27,333
-Your deliveries?
-I'll manage.

452
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:30,916
You always give me three and a half stars.
Maybe now you'll give me five.

453
00:35:31,708 --> 00:35:32,541
Well...

454
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:36,000
-Come on, Pappu.
-That a boy!

455
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:38,333
Need some help?

456
00:35:38,833 --> 00:35:40,041
No, thanks.

457
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,083
Lots of traffic!

458
00:35:47,166 --> 00:35:50,291
-Sorry, are you comfortable?
-I'm fine.

459
00:35:57,375 --> 00:35:58,208
Bye.

460
00:35:58,291 --> 00:35:59,291
Bharat's inside.

461
00:35:59,375 --> 00:36:01,250
I don't want to play.

462
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:21,750
For you.

463
00:36:22,708 --> 00:36:23,875
It's my favorite.

464
00:36:31,833 --> 00:36:33,666
We've taken the wrong road?

465
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:38,541
Depends on your perspective.
The road's different, not wrong.

466
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:40,958
Works for my delivery.

467
00:36:41,708 --> 00:36:42,541
Mrs. Yadav.

468
00:36:43,125 --> 00:36:45,375
-Yes.
-Is the AC cooling well?

469
00:36:46,541 --> 00:36:47,916
I'm used to it.

470
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:50,791
But sometimes, it's too cold.

471
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,666
Sorry, madam, sorry.

472
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:02,583
-Did you get hurt?
-No. But... I'll go.

473
00:37:02,666 --> 00:37:04,583
-Let me drop you.
-No, it's fine.

474
00:37:04,666 --> 00:37:05,916
Ma'am--
It's okay.

475
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,583
But we're right there...

476
00:37:10,958 --> 00:37:11,791
Thank you.

477
00:37:12,375 --> 00:37:14,291
Keep ordering from Ippy, ma'am.

478
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:17,000
I still won't give you five stars.

479
00:37:28,666 --> 00:37:29,875
How are you, brother?

480
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:32,666
Come here.

481
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,875
Who's that?

482
00:37:34,958 --> 00:37:35,833
Billa.

483
00:37:36,208 --> 00:37:37,041
DJ's brother.

484
00:37:37,583 --> 00:37:39,583
Get rid of that Muslim girl.

485
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,125
Right?

486
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,750
Get me a beer.

487
00:37:46,416 --> 00:37:47,875
How's your music thing going?

488
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,458
-I've made a cracking new track.
-When are we going to hear it?

489
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,708
I'll give it to you.

490
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:56,375
Feed your college buddies
for free, Ippy boy!

491
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,833
What's that?

492
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,375
The bill, Billa.

493
00:38:01,458 --> 00:38:03,625
Please pay up.
I've a lot of deliveries.

494
00:38:03,958 --> 00:38:04,791
Here.

495
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:08,416
-Gulp it down.
-I don't want it.

496
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,333
Please... pay the bill.
I've to do accounts

497
00:38:10,416 --> 00:38:12,416
-and my assignments--
-Working hard?

498
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,041
Think you'll be
the billionaire of Greater Noida?

499
00:38:15,208 --> 00:38:17,125
Bloody snipdick!

500
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,583
Tell me...

501
00:38:20,958 --> 00:38:24,166
does your snipped cock
give more pleasure or less?

502
00:38:25,875 --> 00:38:27,125
More or less?

503
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:30,666
Billa, please pay the bill.

504
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:33,291
The bill? Here's your payment!

505
00:38:34,625 --> 00:38:35,791
Let it go.

506
00:38:36,791 --> 00:38:39,375
The Ippy boy's a virgin.
Get out of here.

507
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:41,250
Bloody cocksucker!

508
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,416
Get some food for my brother.

509
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,666
Let's eat.

510
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,416
Let's listen to your new track.

511
00:38:47,541 --> 00:38:49,541
-I'll play it.
-Let's eat.

512
00:39:08,791 --> 00:39:10,875
-Mom?
-Yes.

513
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:14,791
I have a cultural event at work.

514
00:39:14,875 --> 00:39:16,625
Go do your homework.

515
00:39:28,416 --> 00:39:31,541
Dress rehearsal for your office event?

516
00:39:32,333 --> 00:39:33,708
No, just...

517
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:36,625
trying out a new style.

518
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:38,625
You don't like it?

519
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:41,666
It's great.

520
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,750
Shall we go for a drive?

521
00:39:58,041 --> 00:40:00,333
The lights...

522
00:40:00,958 --> 00:40:02,250
And the kids?

523
00:40:03,833 --> 00:40:05,791
Heard of "the midlife crisis"?

524
00:40:06,291 --> 00:40:08,125
You've all the symptoms.

525
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,833
Hello, this is Kitty,

526
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:21,250
your new companion
on the Red Rose Romance app.

527
00:40:21,875 --> 00:40:23,958
Hi, Pradeep?

528
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:25,875
<i>-Have you had dinner?</i>
-What?

529
00:40:26,166 --> 00:40:27,916
<i>What did you eat?</i>

530
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,291
Chinese.

531
00:40:29,916 --> 00:40:33,291
My office provides
a variety of food, all for free.

532
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:36,291
That's good. I won't have to
worry about you every day.

533
00:40:37,125 --> 00:40:38,875
Or I'd feel bad eating dinner

534
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:42,416
while my friend's hungry.

535
00:40:42,625 --> 00:40:43,791
You're quite caring.

536
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:45,333
And daring too!

537
00:40:47,625 --> 00:40:48,583
You are daring.

538
00:40:49,416 --> 00:40:52,041
Or you wouldn't call me your friend.

539
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:55,291
But you said you're my new companion.

540
00:40:56,375 --> 00:40:58,333
And you sound sweet.

541
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:00,458
So I took a chance.

542
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,875
But we've only been talking
for a few minutes.

543
00:41:02,958 --> 00:41:03,791
<i>So what?</i>

544
00:41:03,875 --> 00:41:06,208
You can fall in love
in just a few minutes.

545
00:41:06,416 --> 00:41:07,375
<i>Don't you agree?</i>

546
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:14,166
You sound rather romantic.

547
00:41:15,333 --> 00:41:16,791
Are you getting bored?

548
00:41:17,375 --> 00:41:19,750
-Actually, I am--
-Actually, what?

549
00:41:19,833 --> 00:41:20,958
<i>I'm having fun.</i>

550
00:41:21,041 --> 00:41:23,583
It feels like I'm using the app...

551
00:41:23,958 --> 00:41:25,958
so you can flirt with me.

552
00:41:26,041 --> 00:41:27,375
Flirt and me?

553
00:41:28,041 --> 00:41:28,875
No way.

554
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:31,416
I don't even know the "F" of flirting.

555
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,625
-Oh, really?
<i>-Honestly, I don't.</i>

556
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:35,333
Do you know the "L" of flirting?

557
00:41:35,416 --> 00:41:38,583
"L"?
I'll have to think.

558
00:41:39,125 --> 00:41:40,208
Tell me.

559
00:41:40,291 --> 00:41:42,833
"L" for Ludo.

560
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:45,958
"L" as in, Ludo.

561
00:41:46,708 --> 00:41:48,208
"L" for...

562
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,875
London.

563
00:41:49,958 --> 00:41:52,291
Oh, God. You're so...

564
00:41:52,375 --> 00:41:54,875
"L" as in London.
What were you thinking?

565
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:57,833
I thought, "L" as in Lucknow.

566
00:41:58,291 --> 00:41:59,458
Oh, Lucknow.

567
00:41:59,541 --> 00:42:02,000
Kitty baby's upset with me?

568
00:42:02,083 --> 00:42:07,125
Your combination of "caring"
and "daring" is... ultrahazardous.

569
00:42:07,208 --> 00:42:09,083
"Ultrahazardous"?

570
00:42:10,083 --> 00:42:12,333
Who uses such words? Where are you from?

571
00:42:13,125 --> 00:42:14,708
Are you making fun of me?

572
00:42:15,208 --> 00:42:17,500
Never!
Now, tell me...

573
00:42:20,958 --> 00:42:23,125
Asthua, Darbhanga District, Bihar.

574
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:26,291
Kitty from Darbhanga.

575
00:42:29,708 --> 00:42:31,250
Tell me your real name.

576
00:42:31,458 --> 00:42:32,291
Kaa--

577
00:42:33,041 --> 00:42:34,750
How does it matter?

578
00:42:34,833 --> 00:42:35,958
It's just a name.

579
00:42:36,041 --> 00:42:38,750
-Okay, tell me your age.
-I'm over 21.

580
00:42:39,916 --> 00:42:40,791
And you?

581
00:42:40,875 --> 00:42:42,291
Just a few years older.

582
00:42:44,125 --> 00:42:46,041
We'll be good together, right?

583
00:42:46,833 --> 00:42:49,125
Do you like chocolates?

584
00:42:49,625 --> 00:42:51,041
I'm thinking of sending you some.

585
00:42:51,125 --> 00:42:54,666
Only if you like me...
as a complimentary gift.

586
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:58,125
A foreign one.
And Fruit and Nut is my favorite.

587
00:42:58,875 --> 00:42:59,916
I'll think about it.

588
00:43:01,666 --> 00:43:02,833
Is anyone there?

589
00:43:03,208 --> 00:43:04,416
I need water.

590
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,583
Alright, Kitty baby.

591
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,041
Let's talk tomorrow.

592
00:43:10,041 --> 00:43:11,375
Good night, Pradeep.

593
00:43:11,458 --> 00:43:13,708
Please call me "baby."

594
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:15,916
Good night, Pradeep.

595
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,083
Please say "baby."

596
00:43:17,208 --> 00:43:18,291
Good night.

597
00:43:20,916 --> 00:43:22,625
Brilliant call, wasn't it?

598
00:43:22,708 --> 00:43:24,458
The chat was a bit too personal.

599
00:43:24,958 --> 00:43:26,291
But it was great!

600
00:43:36,416 --> 00:43:38,750
-Kaajal!
<i>-I'm busy, Dolly.</i>

601
00:43:39,041 --> 00:43:42,666
How busy are you?
It's easier to call the prime minister.

602
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:44,166
<i>Call you later.</i>

603
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:48,208
What happened?

604
00:43:48,291 --> 00:43:49,166
Nothing.

605
00:43:49,291 --> 00:43:53,333
Feels like a new era for women. Right?

606
00:43:54,083 --> 00:43:55,541
Definitely a new era for you.

607
00:44:11,583 --> 00:44:14,750
Bring it in. Yes, this way.
Watch your step.

608
00:44:14,833 --> 00:44:18,583
Keep it here and plug it in.
Carefully.

609
00:44:18,916 --> 00:44:20,458
Keep it on top.

610
00:44:20,541 --> 00:44:23,166
Excellent!

611
00:44:23,625 --> 00:44:25,541
Turn it towards me.

612
00:44:25,625 --> 00:44:28,000
Hold on. Let me sit.

613
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,750
I can't feel it on my face.

614
00:44:32,916 --> 00:44:34,916
Let me turn it towards me.

615
00:44:35,416 --> 00:44:36,916
Perfect!

616
00:44:45,791 --> 00:44:47,166
Wonderful.

617
00:44:49,875 --> 00:44:51,458
The rest of the installment.

618
00:44:53,333 --> 00:44:54,791
-Okay... Paying in cash?
-Yes.

619
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:57,208
The receipt?

620
00:44:57,291 --> 00:45:00,208
-Where's your husband?
-He's busy.

621
00:45:00,291 --> 00:45:01,791
Busy earning a living.

622
00:45:01,875 --> 00:45:03,291
-Some snacks?
-No, thanks.

623
00:45:03,375 --> 00:45:04,291
Okay.

624
00:45:04,958 --> 00:45:06,250
-Here you go.
-Yes.

625
00:45:07,541 --> 00:45:08,416
Thank you.

626
00:45:23,666 --> 00:45:25,750
Look at that hot piece of meat!

627
00:45:25,875 --> 00:45:30,958
The bus goes to Delhi!
Hop in!

628
00:45:31,041 --> 00:45:33,000
Come on, sweetie!

629
00:45:33,416 --> 00:45:34,541
Ride with us!

630
00:45:34,708 --> 00:45:38,125
Looking hot! Come party with us!

631
00:45:39,583 --> 00:45:40,541
Kaajal!

632
00:45:41,166 --> 00:45:42,000
Get in!

633
00:45:42,125 --> 00:45:43,416
-Hi.
-Hi.

634
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:51,583
Am I looking okay?

635
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:53,916
Looking fine.

636
00:45:55,875 --> 00:45:57,333
You're looking smashing.

637
00:46:08,541 --> 00:46:10,416
Fancy car. Is it yours?

638
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,041
Just enjoy it.

639
00:46:12,958 --> 00:46:13,791
Comfortable?

640
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:35,708
-Mr. Chaudhary.
-Come, my sweetheart.

641
00:46:35,791 --> 00:46:37,750
-How are you?
-Looking gorgeous as ever.

642
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:38,791
Thank you.

643
00:46:38,875 --> 00:46:40,458
-Love you.
-Love you, too.

644
00:46:40,541 --> 00:46:41,375
Ajay.

645
00:46:41,416 --> 00:46:42,250
Hello.

646
00:46:46,041 --> 00:46:46,875
Hello.

647
00:46:47,833 --> 00:46:49,375
-Hi.
-How're you doing?

648
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,125
The usual.

649
00:46:52,208 --> 00:46:53,458
Two whiskeys, please.

650
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:04,666
DJ Pyari, in the house!

651
00:47:17,791 --> 00:47:21,208
How's the new building going?

652
00:47:21,291 --> 00:47:25,625
I'm selling all
the flats in Star Heights.

653
00:47:25,708 --> 00:47:28,208
Superb plan!
Sell the fucking building,

654
00:47:28,291 --> 00:47:30,166
forget about the construction!

655
00:48:19,541 --> 00:48:20,375
What?

656
00:48:20,833 --> 00:48:22,500
Want to increase your rate?

657
00:48:24,583 --> 00:48:25,458
How much?

658
00:48:25,541 --> 00:48:27,500
-Bathroom!
-Bathroom?

659
00:48:27,791 --> 00:48:30,000
Wait, I'll join you.

660
00:48:37,666 --> 00:48:39,583
Greater Noida is a great city.

661
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:43,875
Foreigners, hospital, colleges, factories.

662
00:48:44,333 --> 00:48:47,833
Ten thousand new jobs...
A racetrack--

663
00:48:47,916 --> 00:48:51,500
-Can you play a hymn?
-Who listens to those?

664
00:48:53,458 --> 00:48:56,416
-The metro's coming up.
-Turn up the volume.

665
00:49:57,375 --> 00:50:00,791
Don't be a martyr.
We're all selling our bodies.

666
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:04,500
Your secret's safe with me.
Don't worry.

667
00:50:07,333 --> 00:50:08,708
Shazia, I love you!

668
00:50:08,833 --> 00:50:09,666
Yeah!

669
00:50:10,291 --> 00:50:11,458
I love you too.

670
00:50:20,333 --> 00:50:24,333
-Down with...
-Red Rose!

671
00:50:24,416 --> 00:50:27,250
-Down with...
-Red Rose!

672
00:50:27,333 --> 00:50:28,625
-Red Rose!
-Down!

673
00:50:28,708 --> 00:50:32,416
-No more...
-Vulgarity!

674
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,916
-Red Rose!
-Down, down!

675
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:38,666
<i>Is my baby in a bad mood?</i>

676
00:50:40,541 --> 00:50:43,583
What happened, Kitty?
Is everyone okay in your family?

677
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:45,708
-Yes.
<i>-So, what's wrong?</i>

678
00:50:46,833 --> 00:50:47,666
I don't know.

679
00:50:49,708 --> 00:50:52,958
Sometimes I wonder
if I should be doing this job at all.

680
00:50:54,125 --> 00:50:57,166
And then, I think
I should just go back home.

681
00:50:58,291 --> 00:50:59,958
And what would you do there?

682
00:51:05,875 --> 00:51:09,416
-Did you like the chocolates?
-They were okay.

683
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:13,833
May have tasted better,
if we'd eaten them together.

684
00:51:13,916 --> 00:51:16,583
-Should've called me at that time.
<i>-I was busy.</i>

685
00:51:18,041 --> 00:51:20,583
-You were busy at night?
<i>-Do you like the night?</i>

686
00:51:21,625 --> 00:51:23,166
More than the day.

687
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:25,541
-Not scared of the dark?
<i>-I am.</i>

688
00:51:28,333 --> 00:51:30,791
But the stars only twinkle in the dark.

689
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:31,916
<i>Kitty.</i>

690
00:51:32,916 --> 00:51:33,833
Pradeep...

691
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:37,666
do you think about me?

692
00:51:39,083 --> 00:51:41,333
I do, that's why I call you.

693
00:51:41,958 --> 00:51:43,583
I also think about you.

694
00:51:43,666 --> 00:51:44,500
<i>Really?</i>

695
00:51:44,583 --> 00:51:45,875
But you don't call me.

696
00:51:45,958 --> 00:51:47,958
You know I can't, Pradeep.

697
00:51:48,791 --> 00:51:50,250
Listen...

698
00:51:50,875 --> 00:51:52,041
I've to go.

699
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:55,208
So, good night, baby.

700
00:51:56,958 --> 00:51:57,791
Good night.

701
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,625
Why can't you just say "Goodnight, baby"?

702
00:52:02,791 --> 00:52:04,625
I'm not as daring as you.

703
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:06,000
At least try.

704
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:09,458
Good night, Pradeep.

705
00:52:10,875 --> 00:52:11,750
Baby.

706
00:52:17,916 --> 00:52:19,083
Okay, bye. Good night.

707
00:52:27,875 --> 00:52:31,666
Are apps like Red Rose
destroying Indian culture?

708
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:35,083
<i>Or is it just a unique strategy</i>
<i>to boost gift sales?</i>

709
00:52:35,166 --> 00:52:39,541
<i>We'll continue the debate.</i>
<i>Keep watching </i>Noida News Service.

710
00:52:39,625 --> 00:52:43,875
<i>With cameraman Ashok Singh,</i>
<i>I'm Raghav Malhotra from Greater Noida.</i>

711
00:52:43,958 --> 00:52:44,875
<i>Thank you.</i>

712
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:56,458
Kaajal? Come here.

713
00:53:00,916 --> 00:53:03,708
-You're all over the news.
-I was going to tell you everything--

714
00:53:03,791 --> 00:53:06,708
Girls from decent families
don't do such jobs, Kaajal.

715
00:53:07,791 --> 00:53:09,875
You should be proud of your sister.

716
00:53:10,416 --> 00:53:12,875
A backward caste girl from Bihar
is earning so well--

717
00:53:12,958 --> 00:53:14,416
Shut up!

718
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:17,625
Dolly, I'm just doing my job.

719
00:53:17,708 --> 00:53:19,916
And smoking, drinking, partying?

720
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,083
I know you're going wild.

721
00:53:22,166 --> 00:53:23,875
Even I know things.

722
00:53:24,583 --> 00:53:27,791
Your Star Heights flat...
is never getting completed.

723
00:53:28,833 --> 00:53:31,583
How do you know?
Did the builder tell you?

724
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,083
Yes.

725
00:53:36,041 --> 00:53:37,041
What?

726
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:39,583
Kaajal!

727
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:41,250
Kaajal.

728
00:53:41,583 --> 00:53:42,791
And Dolly,

729
00:53:42,875 --> 00:53:45,458
this purple top
with the nuptial chain

730
00:53:45,541 --> 00:53:47,291
makes you look like a freak!

731
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,750
The gold in your hair
doesn't suit you either!

732
00:54:08,875 --> 00:54:11,625
I'm doing everything I bloody can
to pay for this house!

733
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:15,166
Is the building ever going to be ready?

734
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:21,875
Hello.

735
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:25,125
<i>Dolly, please don't tell my parents</i>
<i>about my job.</i>

736
00:54:25,208 --> 00:54:26,458
<i>They'll bury me alive.</i>

737
00:54:26,541 --> 00:54:27,541
Please, Dolly.

738
00:54:29,875 --> 00:54:32,291
-Promise me?
-I'm not making any promises.

739
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:41,791
<i>Construction in various new buildings</i>
<i>in the city has stopped.</i>

740
00:54:41,875 --> 00:54:44,500
<i>Citizens who've invested</i>
<i>their life savings...</i>

741
00:54:44,583 --> 00:54:46,708
<i>-are burning with anger.</i>
-Bloody hell! Look at this.

742
00:54:46,791 --> 00:54:48,958
Thank God we've not paid in full.

743
00:54:49,041 --> 00:54:52,125
We'll pay the rest
when construction resumes.

744
00:54:52,208 --> 00:54:54,916
Now you don't need
to take the office loan.

745
00:54:56,625 --> 00:54:57,750
These bloody builders!

746
00:54:58,208 --> 00:55:00,625
Fucking corrupt!

747
00:55:00,708 --> 00:55:03,375
Don't stress. You'll pass your exams.

748
00:55:03,458 --> 00:55:06,333
What's your breast size?

749
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:09,375
They wouldn't fit in your hands.

750
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:17,083
Shall I gift you some toffees,
or plastic roses?

751
00:55:18,291 --> 00:55:20,041
Hi, handsome. June here.

752
00:55:20,541 --> 00:55:23,291
What happened, Pradeep?
Forgotten me?

753
00:55:23,875 --> 00:55:27,000
Liar. Keep my heart safe.

754
00:55:27,541 --> 00:55:30,791
Hold me tight in your strong arms.

755
00:55:31,458 --> 00:55:32,916
Just like that.

756
00:55:34,708 --> 00:55:37,041
What's my cutie doing with his hands?

757
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:47,000
June baby, let's talk tomorrow.

758
00:55:47,833 --> 00:55:50,041
Couldn't you bloody wait for me?

759
00:55:51,916 --> 00:55:53,166
You're jealous.

760
00:55:55,291 --> 00:55:56,166
Listen...

761
00:55:57,291 --> 00:56:00,625
-now tell me your name.
-Only when the time's right.

762
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,083
First, call Kitty.

763
00:56:08,791 --> 00:56:11,041
You got mad at me today
for no reason.

764
00:56:11,125 --> 00:56:13,000
Honestly, I was really calling you.

765
00:56:21,333 --> 00:56:23,583
It'll relax your muscles.

766
00:56:31,333 --> 00:56:32,375
How do you feel?

767
00:56:33,958 --> 00:56:35,333
I can't feel anything.

768
00:57:04,625 --> 00:57:07,500
Mrs. Yadav, this is a civilized school.

769
00:57:08,208 --> 00:57:09,666
With great values.

770
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:12,000
We cannot tolerate this violent behavior.

771
00:57:13,708 --> 00:57:15,208
Why did you go to the girls' bathroom?

772
00:57:15,291 --> 00:57:17,500
-I had to pee.
-But the girls' loo?

773
00:57:17,583 --> 00:57:20,041
Makes me feel like one of the girls.

774
00:57:20,125 --> 00:57:23,208
He showed me his pee-pee,
and his bra!

775
00:57:23,291 --> 00:57:25,458
Who wears their mother's bra?

776
00:57:25,541 --> 00:57:28,625
You wear a bra too.
I wore it inside my shirt.

777
00:57:28,708 --> 00:57:29,541
Pappu.

778
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:33,083
Apologize to everybody.

779
00:57:33,166 --> 00:57:34,875
What did I do?

780
00:57:34,958 --> 00:57:36,875
-Apologize!
-Sorry.

781
00:57:37,833 --> 00:57:40,250
Mrs. Yadav, an apology isn't enough.

782
00:57:40,333 --> 00:57:42,500
We have to take strict action.

783
00:57:42,583 --> 00:57:44,625
I apologize on his behalf.

784
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:46,833
I'll... fix him.

785
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:51,833
Want to be a girl?

786
00:57:53,166 --> 00:57:55,875
You'll kill him! Stop!

787
00:58:01,291 --> 00:58:05,458
Is there a connection
between my problem and Pappu's?

788
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:49,458
Dolly?

789
00:58:50,041 --> 00:58:50,875
Yes?

790
00:58:52,333 --> 00:58:53,666
You asked me to come.

791
00:58:54,875 --> 00:58:55,750
Ma?

792
00:58:55,833 --> 00:58:58,041
I've been waiting for you.

793
00:58:58,500 --> 00:58:59,833
It's been over an hour.

794
00:59:00,458 --> 00:59:02,250
You never fixed a date or time.

795
00:59:02,916 --> 00:59:05,041
You came here as soon as you got my text?

796
00:59:05,958 --> 00:59:07,250
Why don't we go in?

797
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:09,750
Get me a cold drink.

798
00:59:30,708 --> 00:59:32,083
Charming dollhouse.

799
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:40,208
-Are you happy?
-Yes, extremely.

800
00:59:40,875 --> 00:59:44,041
We're getting a fancier house.

801
00:59:45,625 --> 00:59:49,916
You were so intelligent and talented,
I thought you'd grow up

802
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,416
to be a high ranking government official.

803
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:56,625
Then you should've stayed
and raised me.

804
01:00:00,208 --> 01:00:01,750
Let's get to the point.

805
01:00:02,375 --> 01:00:04,875
I called you to answer some questions.

806
01:00:05,875 --> 01:00:07,583
I don't need any emotional drama.

807
01:00:09,375 --> 01:00:10,833
You think it's funny?

808
01:00:11,458 --> 01:00:12,291
Not at all.

809
01:00:13,208 --> 01:00:14,750
Sorry. Ask me.

810
01:00:20,291 --> 01:00:22,250
Did I ever want to be a boy?

811
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:27,333
You never played with dolls.

812
01:00:27,916 --> 01:00:30,458
Math was your favorite.

813
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:33,625
But it wasn't a "boy-girl" thing.

814
01:00:37,041 --> 01:00:38,291
How was your sex life?

815
01:00:38,833 --> 01:00:39,666
What?

816
01:00:39,958 --> 01:00:41,208
Answer my question.

817
01:00:46,541 --> 01:00:47,875
With your father...

818
01:00:48,541 --> 01:00:51,666
-it wasn't great--
-But with your lover, it was amazing?

819
01:00:52,291 --> 01:00:53,291
Right?

820
01:00:54,041 --> 01:00:55,208
Dolly, are you happy?

821
01:00:55,291 --> 01:00:58,000
I'm... happy and fulfilled

822
01:00:58,083 --> 01:01:00,375
with my life and my husband.

823
01:01:01,166 --> 01:01:03,500
Extremely happy.

824
01:01:06,541 --> 01:01:08,750
My sex life was deeply fulfilling too.

825
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:13,958
-But your lover abandoned you?
-But he helped me become free.

826
01:01:15,583 --> 01:01:17,291
Congratulations on your freedom.

827
01:01:17,833 --> 01:01:20,333
I want you to feel free--

828
01:01:20,416 --> 01:01:21,375
I'm already free!

829
01:01:23,666 --> 01:01:25,291
How did you support yourself?

830
01:01:27,333 --> 01:01:28,625
I did what I had to do.

831
01:01:28,708 --> 01:01:30,750
Why did you abandon me as a kid, bitch?

832
01:01:37,166 --> 01:01:39,333
I'm not here to justify
my decisions, Dolly.

833
01:01:39,958 --> 01:01:41,458
I made the choices I wanted.

834
01:01:41,541 --> 01:01:43,208
I wasn't happy with my life.

835
01:01:45,458 --> 01:01:46,416
So, I left...

836
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:48,750
that's all.

837
01:01:50,958 --> 01:01:52,500
And, honestly...

838
01:01:54,958 --> 01:01:57,541
I want to enjoy being a grandmother.

839
01:01:58,041 --> 01:02:00,333
My kids don't need a grandmother!

840
01:02:01,958 --> 01:02:03,958
I'm a good, dutiful mother.

841
01:02:04,041 --> 01:02:06,958
Not like you... a heartless mother
who abandoned her child!

842
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:14,083
Do you have...

843
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:19,750
-any more questions--
-No. Please... leave.

844
01:02:29,916 --> 01:02:30,750
I thought...

845
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,541
I'd stay a few days...

846
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:38,166
with you.

847
01:02:40,291 --> 01:02:41,750
We'd have long chats...

848
01:02:44,250 --> 01:02:45,125
Never mind.

849
01:02:46,958 --> 01:02:48,583
Maybe some other time.

850
01:02:49,083 --> 01:02:49,958
I'll get going.

851
01:03:50,958 --> 01:03:52,083
How's Kaajal?

852
01:03:52,708 --> 01:03:53,875
Why doesn't she visit?

853
01:03:54,375 --> 01:03:55,916
Tomorrow's Sunday, invite her.

854
01:03:58,791 --> 01:04:01,125
Call her now or you'll forget.

855
01:04:01,208 --> 01:04:02,083
I'll call.

856
01:04:02,333 --> 01:04:03,208
Call now.

857
01:04:13,958 --> 01:04:16,791
<i>The number you are trying to call</i>
<i>is currently not reachable.</i>

858
01:04:16,875 --> 01:04:17,916
Can't get through.

859
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,333
Are you senile? Try again.

860
01:04:37,583 --> 01:04:43,125
<i>Life was kind of simple</i>

861
01:04:43,208 --> 01:04:49,416
<i>I was a bird in a cage</i>

862
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:55,375
<i>Now the door is opening</i>
<i>Just a little crack</i>

863
01:04:55,458 --> 01:05:01,375
<i>The sky beckons</i>
<i>And I'm ready to fly a little</i>

864
01:05:02,166 --> 01:05:08,708
<i>It's time to take flight</i>

865
01:05:08,791 --> 01:05:15,791
<i>It's time to live the moment</i>

866
01:05:33,125 --> 01:05:34,041
I love you.

867
01:05:35,041 --> 01:05:38,125
I've come to see the Taj Mahal IRL.
Miss you, baby.

868
01:05:42,708 --> 01:05:45,083
First date in Agra then, baby. IRL.

869
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:54,208
-Baby...
-You're crazy.

870
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:56,708
I want an iPhone, DJ.
Come on, DJ...

871
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:17,708
-Pradeep?
-Kitty.

872
01:06:18,083 --> 01:06:18,916
Yeah.

873
01:06:20,041 --> 01:06:20,875
Hello.

874
01:06:22,291 --> 01:06:23,208
Please sit.

875
01:06:31,458 --> 01:06:32,958
-Water?
-Sure.

876
01:06:38,416 --> 01:06:39,416
That's enough.

877
01:06:39,916 --> 01:06:42,666
-Sorry, I spilled some.
-It's okay.

878
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:43,583
It happens.

879
01:06:46,958 --> 01:06:48,458
After all, you've--

880
01:06:48,708 --> 01:06:50,791
-You're being formal.
-I'll try not to be.

881
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:54,041
-Well, you made it.
-Yeah, I mean...

882
01:06:56,166 --> 01:06:57,250
I had to meet Kitty.

883
01:07:02,833 --> 01:07:03,750
Kaajal Kumari.

884
01:07:03,833 --> 01:07:05,583
You're quite devious.

885
01:07:06,125 --> 01:07:09,541
You gave me your number
but removed your display picture.

886
01:07:12,416 --> 01:07:14,041
What if you hadn't liked me?

887
01:07:17,125 --> 01:07:18,500
You're beautiful.

888
01:07:20,958 --> 01:07:21,875
In Real Life.

889
01:07:23,916 --> 01:07:25,916
You're also beautiful...

890
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:27,166
In Real Life.

891
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:36,416
<i>The night is young, the day beautiful</i>

892
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:43,458
<i>The moment eternal</i>

893
01:07:44,041 --> 01:07:50,500
<i>I've found my wings</i>
<i>I've let go of the fear</i>

894
01:07:50,583 --> 01:07:57,000
<i>My heart's in a tizzy</i>

895
01:08:00,458 --> 01:08:07,458
<i>Doing its own dance</i>

896
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:14,916
<i>Singing its own song</i>

897
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:21,666
<i>The stars are shining upon me</i>

898
01:08:21,750 --> 01:08:27,958
<i>The sunlight is enveloping my heart</i>

899
01:08:28,041 --> 01:08:34,041
<i>The clouds have disappeared</i>

900
01:08:35,458 --> 01:08:40,375
<i>It's time to take flight</i>

901
01:08:40,458 --> 01:08:45,625
<i>It's time to live the moment</i>

902
01:08:45,708 --> 01:08:46,750
-Kaajal.
-Yes.

903
01:08:46,833 --> 01:08:49,375
-I forgot to add it.
-It's okay.

904
01:08:58,250 --> 01:08:59,375
I need one too.

905
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,875
-What?
-A gum, for fresh breath.

906
01:09:02,833 --> 01:09:03,708
Okay.

907
01:09:08,333 --> 01:09:09,833
I want yours.

908
01:09:21,083 --> 01:09:21,958
Time to go.

909
01:09:23,541 --> 01:09:24,375
Bye.

910
01:09:28,541 --> 01:09:29,375
Bye.

911
01:09:31,291 --> 01:09:32,708
Take care. Okay?

912
01:09:46,625 --> 01:09:48,000
I'll stay with you tonight.

913
01:09:53,625 --> 01:09:56,500
-Have you done this before?
-You're the first.

914
01:10:00,625 --> 01:10:02,875
-And you?
-No.

915
01:10:10,458 --> 01:10:13,250
Do you have a condom?

916
01:10:13,708 --> 01:10:15,583
-A condom? Yeah.
-Please put it on.

917
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:31,541
Listen...

918
01:10:32,791 --> 01:10:34,958
can we please go slow?

919
01:10:35,041 --> 01:10:37,083
-It's all happening too fast.
-What do you mean?

920
01:10:45,583 --> 01:10:46,916
Let's just go to sleep.

921
01:11:22,125 --> 01:11:28,208
THE BEST DJ IN GREATER NOIDA

922
01:11:44,208 --> 01:11:45,041
Hey.

923
01:11:54,041 --> 01:11:55,958
Running around like a slut!

924
01:11:56,041 --> 01:11:57,708
Don't call your sister a slut!

925
01:11:57,791 --> 01:12:00,250
-Mind your own business.
-You mind your tongue!

926
01:12:00,333 --> 01:12:02,333
-Who the hell is she?
-Please go, Shazia!

927
01:12:04,083 --> 01:12:04,958
Come with me.

928
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:08,708
-How many have you slept with?
-Dolly.

929
01:12:08,833 --> 01:12:10,416
You came to this city to be a prostitute?

930
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:12,541
What if your parents find out?

931
01:12:13,416 --> 01:12:15,333
I went to see the Taj Mahal.

932
01:12:15,666 --> 01:12:16,833
I know how to have fun.

933
01:12:16,916 --> 01:12:18,208
Not like you!

934
01:12:18,666 --> 01:12:20,791
You've been in Noida for years.

935
01:12:20,875 --> 01:12:23,250
You never go out to Delhi,

936
01:12:23,333 --> 01:12:25,291
and you've never seen the Taj Mahal!

937
01:12:25,375 --> 01:12:27,000
You've done nothing in life!

938
01:12:27,375 --> 01:12:29,416
You're surviving, not living!

939
01:12:58,500 --> 01:12:59,750
Ready?

940
01:13:00,791 --> 01:13:01,875
Let's go.

941
01:13:03,041 --> 01:13:04,875
-I think I have a fever.
-What?

942
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:08,333
My head's been aching.

943
01:13:10,458 --> 01:13:12,708
You're not used to the AC.

944
01:13:12,791 --> 01:13:13,791
Shall we go?

945
01:13:14,791 --> 01:13:18,333
You all go ahead.
I'll apologize to Mrs. Chatterjee.

946
01:13:18,416 --> 01:13:19,250
Well...

947
01:13:20,333 --> 01:13:22,208
Alright.
Let's go, Pappu.

948
01:13:23,083 --> 01:13:24,125
-Let's go.
-Bye, Mommy,

949
01:13:24,208 --> 01:13:25,041
-Bye.
-Bye, Mom.

950
01:13:25,125 --> 01:13:27,250
-Take some medicine.
-Yeah.

951
01:13:27,833 --> 01:13:29,000
Don't drive.

952
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:30,875
-Why?
-You'll be drinking.

953
01:13:33,875 --> 01:13:36,708
Okay. Come on, kids.
Kids, let's enjoy a rickshaw ride.

954
01:13:52,416 --> 01:13:54,791
Sudden plan...?

955
01:13:57,625 --> 01:13:59,208
I just felt like going out.

956
01:14:01,041 --> 01:14:02,291
And you agreed, so...

957
01:14:13,833 --> 01:14:14,750
Want some?

958
01:14:14,833 --> 01:14:17,833
No, I don't drink.

959
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:20,833
You're a kid.

960
01:14:23,583 --> 01:14:24,416
It's not that.

961
01:14:25,250 --> 01:14:26,583
I just don't drink.

962
01:14:42,833 --> 01:14:44,041
What happened?

963
01:14:45,125 --> 01:14:46,083
Hey, be careful.

964
01:14:50,333 --> 01:14:51,500
Drive faster.

965
01:14:55,291 --> 01:14:57,916
Delhi, here I come!

966
01:15:35,833 --> 01:15:36,750
For you.

967
01:15:37,458 --> 01:15:38,416
Thank you.

968
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:40,375
My mother loves these flowers.

969
01:15:42,083 --> 01:15:43,708
You miss your mother?

970
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:46,750
Sometimes.

971
01:15:48,291 --> 01:15:49,875
-Do you miss yours?
-No.

972
01:15:50,583 --> 01:15:52,166
I mean, not really.

973
01:15:56,125 --> 01:15:57,541
Should I tie it?

974
01:15:57,833 --> 01:15:58,791
Yes.

975
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:01,125
Help me.

976
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:12,666
Do you like it here in Noida?

977
01:16:14,375 --> 01:16:16,791
You grab your chances
and you find happiness.

978
01:16:37,166 --> 01:16:38,416
We should go.

979
01:16:40,125 --> 01:16:41,375
It's late.

980
01:16:42,083 --> 01:16:43,833
Don't you have college tomorrow?

981
01:16:44,083 --> 01:16:44,916
I guess...

982
01:16:46,291 --> 01:16:47,125
Yes.

983
01:16:48,208 --> 01:16:49,250
Shall we?

984
01:17:04,375 --> 01:17:05,750
Feeling better, Dolly?

985
01:17:07,416 --> 01:17:08,666
Is the fever gone?

986
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:40,750
Shall I send you some chocolates?

987
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:43,500
<i>Sweet, Kitty?</i>

988
01:18:44,083 --> 01:18:47,125
A little sweet, a little spicy.
Chili chocolates.

989
01:18:47,458 --> 01:18:48,416
Shall I send some?

990
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:52,083
<i>Feed me with one hand...</i>
<i>and touch me with the other.</i>

991
01:18:58,083 --> 01:18:59,958
I can touch you with flowers,

992
01:19:00,333 --> 01:19:01,416
not my hands.

993
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:05,000
If flowers could please me,
I'd be senile by now.

994
01:19:09,166 --> 01:19:10,416
<i>What happened, Kitty?</i>

995
01:19:12,625 --> 01:19:13,833
You are funny.

996
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,250
What's with your voice?

997
01:19:18,083 --> 01:19:18,916
Nothing.

998
01:19:21,416 --> 01:19:23,375
My heart's beating fast.

999
01:19:25,416 --> 01:19:27,041
I want to hear your heartbeat.

1000
01:19:28,250 --> 01:19:30,250
<i>I want to hear you breathe.</i>

1001
01:19:34,375 --> 01:19:35,416
Louder.

1002
01:19:45,666 --> 01:19:46,833
Kitty...

1003
01:20:56,416 --> 01:20:57,791
We'll move to Canada.

1004
01:20:58,333 --> 01:20:59,166
That's the plan.

1005
01:20:59,750 --> 01:21:01,916
He has to finish
selling a building, then...

1006
01:21:04,458 --> 01:21:06,750
-And DJ?
-That was a fling.

1007
01:21:07,291 --> 01:21:08,291
Keep my phone.

1008
01:21:10,750 --> 01:21:11,625
Keep it.

1009
01:21:13,750 --> 01:21:16,333
-Naveen got me a fancier one.
-Show me!

1010
01:21:22,666 --> 01:21:23,541
It's so cool.

1011
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:29,333
Hello.

1012
01:21:31,708 --> 01:21:32,541
Pappu?

1013
01:21:34,125 --> 01:21:34,958
Where?

1014
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:37,333
Yes.

1015
01:21:37,458 --> 01:21:40,416
-What happened, Mrs. Yadav?
-I've to rush to Delhi.

1016
01:21:40,541 --> 01:21:43,333
Why suddenly?

1017
01:22:10,750 --> 01:22:13,083
Mom, don't I look pretty?

1018
01:22:13,875 --> 01:22:16,916
Are you crazy, Pappu?
What if something had happened to you?

1019
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:20,500
You can beat me at home.
Let me enjoy myself till then.

1020
01:23:21,375 --> 01:23:22,833
Do you have a condom?

1021
01:23:25,916 --> 01:23:27,583
-Sure?
-Yes, I'm ready.

1022
01:23:29,375 --> 01:23:30,833
Hang on. 

1023
01:23:30,916 --> 01:23:32,666
I'll get it.

1024
01:23:57,583 --> 01:23:58,458
I love you.

1025
01:23:59,750 --> 01:24:00,875
Kitty.

1026
01:24:01,541 --> 01:24:02,666
Kaajal.

1027
01:24:06,833 --> 01:24:08,750
I love you... Kaajal.

1028
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:10,458
I love you.

1029
01:24:18,666 --> 01:24:21,041
Hope you're not thinking
about another client.

1030
01:24:21,208 --> 01:24:22,041
Huh?

1031
01:24:28,208 --> 01:24:29,041
I'm kidding.

1032
01:24:31,833 --> 01:24:33,458
I'm the only one, right?

1033
01:25:44,875 --> 01:25:46,958
A graveyard can also be heaven.

1034
01:25:48,166 --> 01:25:49,708
You say strange things.

1035
01:25:50,458 --> 01:25:51,375
No.

1036
01:25:54,125 --> 01:25:55,333
Okay, tell me...

1037
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:59,666
what would you write on my tombstone?

1038
01:26:02,791 --> 01:26:04,958
"Osman Ansari.

1039
01:26:05,833 --> 01:26:07,333
Five twinkling stars."

1040
01:26:50,875 --> 01:26:53,375
On Rose Day,
you give roses to someone you love.

1041
01:26:54,416 --> 01:26:55,666
It's Rose Day?

1042
01:27:29,791 --> 01:27:31,416
I wasn't your first, right?

1043
01:27:37,916 --> 01:27:38,750
It's okay.

1044
01:27:39,750 --> 01:27:41,833
I'm glad you're my first.

1045
01:27:47,458 --> 01:27:49,083
I'm older than you, baby, so...

1046
01:27:53,708 --> 01:27:56,375
I'm not interested
in your past experiences.

1047
01:27:58,666 --> 01:28:00,375
You're not my first...

1048
01:28:01,625 --> 01:28:03,958
but I swear, you're my last.

1049
01:28:11,583 --> 01:28:14,750
So, can I claim you as my boyfriend?

1050
01:28:16,083 --> 01:28:17,625
Yeah, baby.

1051
01:28:19,791 --> 01:28:21,000
"Boyfriend" sounds good.

1052
01:28:22,416 --> 01:28:25,208
<i>Love will destroy you, love is painful</i>
<i>There's no hope in love</i>

1053
01:28:25,291 --> 01:28:28,333
<i>Only misery awaits</i>
<i>If you walk the path of love</i>

1054
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:31,333
<i>Love's a weapon, love's a dagger</i>
<i>Searing through your heart</i>

1055
01:28:31,416 --> 01:28:34,333
<i>Love's unjust, it will punish you</i>

1056
01:28:34,416 --> 01:28:37,291
<i>It will dig into your heart</i>
<i>And chop it into a million pieces</i>

1057
01:28:37,375 --> 01:28:40,333
<i>Pure love's a poison</i>
<i>It'll kill you with its deadly fangs</i>

1058
01:28:40,416 --> 01:28:43,083
<i>Shakespeare was a fraud</i>
<i>And so was his Juliet</i>

1059
01:28:43,166 --> 01:28:44,833
<i>Today's Romeo dies in vain</i>

1060
01:28:44,916 --> 01:28:46,583
<i>And Juliet thrives</i>

1061
01:29:11,208 --> 01:29:13,166
POLICE

1062
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:16,583
Sir.

1063
01:29:21,375 --> 01:29:22,250
Chhatra...

1064
01:29:22,875 --> 01:29:23,833
Chhatra what?

1065
01:29:24,833 --> 01:29:28,500
Chhatrasaar Singh.

1066
01:29:29,291 --> 01:29:30,166
Pradeep.

1067
01:29:30,250 --> 01:29:31,083
Address...

1068
01:29:34,291 --> 01:29:35,166
Sir.

1069
01:29:35,958 --> 01:29:38,000
Can we settle this?
If I pay...?

1070
01:29:38,916 --> 01:29:41,166
Won't happen again, sir. I promise.

1071
01:29:46,416 --> 01:29:47,833
Go.

1072
01:29:48,583 --> 01:29:49,416
Pradeep!

1073
01:30:03,250 --> 01:30:06,250
Your "lover boy" didn't help you get out.

1074
01:30:07,625 --> 01:30:08,458
He fled.

1075
01:30:10,625 --> 01:30:12,208
Call somebody from your family.

1076
01:30:14,666 --> 01:30:17,166
Screw the romance. Call!

1077
01:30:26,958 --> 01:30:28,708
Keep your sister on a leash.

1078
01:30:29,291 --> 01:30:30,166
Let's go.

1079
01:30:43,250 --> 01:30:44,458
Bloody slut.

1080
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,291
How much was he paying you?

1081
01:30:47,625 --> 01:30:49,250
Shame on you!

1082
01:31:17,416 --> 01:31:19,666
I'm not a bad person, Dolly.

1083
01:31:24,375 --> 01:31:26,458
You're the only one I have.

1084
01:31:28,625 --> 01:31:29,666
Please, Dolly...

1085
01:31:31,291 --> 01:31:33,750
Please don't be mad at me.

1086
01:31:41,041 --> 01:31:43,041
He is a client but...

1087
01:31:45,625 --> 01:31:47,291
I love him.

1088
01:31:50,333 --> 01:31:53,666
I didn't take a penny from him, I swear.

1089
01:31:56,208 --> 01:31:57,666
But he lied to me.

1090
01:31:58,208 --> 01:31:59,041
Kaajal...

1091
01:32:07,750 --> 01:32:09,916
You also love your husband.

1092
01:32:29,958 --> 01:32:32,833
I'm sorry I said those things about him.

1093
01:32:34,750 --> 01:32:36,333
But you told the truth.

1094
01:32:39,333 --> 01:32:40,583
Can I get a drink?

1095
01:32:43,166 --> 01:32:44,041
What?

1096
01:32:53,041 --> 01:32:54,666
This job you've picked up...

1097
01:32:55,666 --> 01:32:56,875
Do you like it?

1098
01:32:59,125 --> 01:33:01,291
The first time I said "I love you"

1099
01:33:02,666 --> 01:33:03,583
was to a client.

1100
01:33:05,750 --> 01:33:08,750
Every second client just wants phone sex.

1101
01:33:10,958 --> 01:33:12,791
Sometimes I hate myself.

1102
01:33:17,041 --> 01:33:18,083
Am I a whore?

1103
01:33:20,333 --> 01:33:22,375
And if I'm one, it's fine.

1104
01:33:23,416 --> 01:33:25,291
I'm just doing my job.

1105
01:33:26,083 --> 01:33:27,958
Was I forced to sell romance?

1106
01:33:29,541 --> 01:33:30,416
No.

1107
01:33:30,916 --> 01:33:31,875
I made that choice.

1108
01:33:33,041 --> 01:33:35,625
If I'd had other choices,
I may not have...

1109
01:33:36,416 --> 01:33:37,750
Sometimes, I feel

1110
01:33:37,833 --> 01:33:41,625
it'd be great to have
this service for women!

1111
01:33:46,291 --> 01:33:48,375
I lost my virginity today.

1112
01:33:49,333 --> 01:33:51,166
My first time and so disappointing!

1113
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,416
I didn't even climax.

1114
01:33:56,625 --> 01:33:57,708
I just bled.

1115
01:34:02,250 --> 01:34:03,500
It's been two years...

1116
01:34:04,666 --> 01:34:06,375
since I've had sex with Amit.

1117
01:34:08,125 --> 01:34:09,000
Why?

1118
01:34:11,333 --> 01:34:12,458
I'm "frozen."

1119
01:34:12,541 --> 01:34:13,541
What do you mean?

1120
01:34:15,333 --> 01:34:17,750
In English, it's called "frigid."

1121
01:34:19,833 --> 01:34:21,208
There is no sensation

1122
01:34:22,125 --> 01:34:25,166
and penetration is painful...

1123
01:34:26,958 --> 01:34:28,333
I'm never in the mood.

1124
01:34:29,625 --> 01:34:30,625
Why?

1125
01:34:34,166 --> 01:34:36,250
I had my hymen restitched
before marriage.

1126
01:34:36,916 --> 01:34:37,750
I don't know...

1127
01:34:39,333 --> 01:34:42,250
Maybe it's a side effect.

1128
01:34:43,750 --> 01:34:45,333
You had a boyfriend in college?

1129
01:34:50,833 --> 01:34:52,083
And this boy today?

1130
01:34:54,583 --> 01:34:55,708
He's a delivery boy.

1131
01:34:57,708 --> 01:34:59,916
I've seen him around. He's sweet...

1132
01:35:01,125 --> 01:35:02,208
and a little naive.

1133
01:35:04,291 --> 01:35:05,125
Dolly!

1134
01:35:09,916 --> 01:35:11,750
It's my new love...

1135
01:35:12,708 --> 01:35:13,833
whiskey.

1136
01:35:19,958 --> 01:35:20,833
Ditto.

1137
01:35:25,041 --> 01:35:25,875
Dolly...

1138
01:35:30,750 --> 01:35:32,458
Lean back.

1139
01:35:35,166 --> 01:35:37,375
-Drank too much.
-Let me.

1140
01:35:41,666 --> 01:35:44,458
-It's never happened before.
-Don't worry.

1141
01:36:36,333 --> 01:36:38,083
Please take the baby, she's crying.

1142
01:36:43,708 --> 01:36:46,208
Kitty!

1143
01:36:47,750 --> 01:36:49,416
Kitty, listen.

1144
01:36:49,875 --> 01:36:51,083
Are you crazy?

1145
01:36:51,166 --> 01:36:52,500
-Let go!
-Why are you here?

1146
01:36:52,583 --> 01:36:53,541
You're married!

1147
01:36:54,041 --> 01:36:56,041
You have a kid! You're scum!

1148
01:36:56,458 --> 01:36:58,750
-I was going to tell you.
-When?

1149
01:36:58,833 --> 01:37:00,791
-I was going to.
-When?

1150
01:37:00,875 --> 01:37:04,208
Calm down, baby.
We'll talk about this later. Please, baby.

1151
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,166
I'm not your "baby,"
Mr. Chhatrasaar Singh.

1152
01:39:06,916 --> 01:39:07,791
Sorry.

1153
01:39:08,333 --> 01:39:09,458
I'm a virgin.

1154
01:39:11,250 --> 01:39:12,291
I mean, I was.

1155
01:40:16,791 --> 01:40:18,166
Thank you, Mrs. Yadav.

1156
01:40:23,208 --> 01:40:25,250
I should be thanking you.

1157
01:40:43,833 --> 01:40:46,125
"To see a world in a grain of sand

1158
01:40:47,875 --> 01:40:49,833
And a heaven in a wild flower

1159
01:40:52,083 --> 01:40:54,958
To hold infinity in the palm of your hand

1160
01:40:56,750 --> 01:40:58,291
And eternity in an hour"

1161
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,041
According to William Blake,

1162
01:41:02,875 --> 01:41:06,125
we can live an eternity
in just an hour.

1163
01:41:08,250 --> 01:41:10,083
You don't even know my name.

1164
01:41:10,875 --> 01:41:12,166
You never told me.

1165
01:41:14,125 --> 01:41:16,750
Once I get a real job, marry me.

1166
01:41:18,958 --> 01:41:21,458
Get your business degree
and land a fancy job.

1167
01:41:21,708 --> 01:41:23,791
When you head a big company,

1168
01:41:23,875 --> 01:41:26,541
I'll see your picture in the paper
and feel happy.

1169
01:41:28,208 --> 01:41:30,041
I'd still want you to marry me.

1170
01:42:17,041 --> 01:42:18,458
What happened?

1171
01:42:18,958 --> 01:42:19,875
I'm not "frozen."

1172
01:42:21,500 --> 01:42:22,333
Really?

1173
01:42:23,291 --> 01:42:24,166
Good.

1174
01:42:25,291 --> 01:42:26,125
Good?

1175
01:42:26,458 --> 01:42:28,583
How can I take you seriously?

1176
01:42:29,125 --> 01:42:31,625
How do you know
your problem's solved?

1177
01:42:32,083 --> 01:42:34,166
Had sex with Ghanshyam Pandey?

1178
01:43:05,625 --> 01:43:06,458
Mrs. Yadav?

1179
01:43:07,333 --> 01:43:08,875
What's gotten into you?

1180
01:43:10,041 --> 01:43:10,875
Nothing.

1181
01:43:11,875 --> 01:43:13,500
I'm finally enjoying my tea.

1182
01:43:20,291 --> 01:43:21,166
Hello.

1183
01:43:23,041 --> 01:43:24,208
Kitty, this side.

1184
01:43:24,666 --> 01:43:27,000
<i>Kitty... Hold me tight.</i>

1185
01:43:27,833 --> 01:43:31,583
Holding you, darling.
How much tighter?

1186
01:43:31,666 --> 01:43:33,583
<i>Come home and hold me for real.</i>

1187
01:43:37,291 --> 01:43:39,708
-And your wife?
<i>-Wife?</i>

1188
01:43:39,791 --> 01:43:41,333
In the mood for a threesome?

1189
01:43:41,416 --> 01:43:45,166
Yes, Amit... your wife.
What about her?

1190
01:43:47,291 --> 01:43:48,416
<i>What nonsense!</i>

1191
01:43:49,333 --> 01:43:51,291
-I've paid you.
<i>-I'm serious.</i>

1192
01:43:51,375 --> 01:43:53,833
Does Dolly know you do this?

1193
01:43:54,833 --> 01:43:55,708
Dolly?

1194
01:43:55,791 --> 01:43:59,333
She's too innocent.
She can't see the real you.

1195
01:44:00,041 --> 01:44:02,416
I want to tell the whole family--

1196
01:44:13,708 --> 01:44:15,583
I guess this job is too much for you.

1197
01:44:30,416 --> 01:44:33,250
Need a lift, sweetie?
Come on, hop in!

1198
01:44:45,416 --> 01:44:47,500
You shouldn't have called
her parents here.

1199
01:44:47,583 --> 01:44:50,041
Why not? It's my duty.

1200
01:44:50,708 --> 01:44:52,291
Kaajal's our responsibility.

1201
01:44:52,375 --> 01:44:55,166
They should know what job
their daughter does.

1202
01:44:55,916 --> 01:44:57,458
And how do you know?

1203
01:45:02,208 --> 01:45:04,416
Don't embarrass us, please!

1204
01:45:05,291 --> 01:45:07,750
You've brought us enough shame already!

1205
01:45:07,875 --> 01:45:09,583
And now, this?

1206
01:45:10,291 --> 01:45:12,083
You're blaming me...

1207
01:45:13,333 --> 01:45:16,458
-but what about Amit using the app?
-Don't disrespect your brother-in-law.

1208
01:45:16,541 --> 01:45:18,000
Come back to Darbhanga.

1209
01:45:18,083 --> 01:45:20,458
We'll marry you off to a decent man.

1210
01:45:20,541 --> 01:45:23,083
You can live with dignity.
So, don't be an idiot!

1211
01:45:53,416 --> 01:45:54,375
Bharat.

1212
01:45:55,291 --> 01:45:56,666
Anything else, Pappu?

1213
01:45:58,375 --> 01:45:59,666
Which flavor? 

1214
01:46:00,291 --> 01:46:02,125
Two raspberry ice creams.

1215
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:06,166
I don't want it.

1216
01:46:06,791 --> 01:46:08,958
What? Are you not well?

1217
01:46:09,375 --> 01:46:11,000
I don't want it.

1218

Kaajal, I'll abandon everything.

My family, my job, everything!

1228
01:46:41,791 --> 01:46:43,833
-And then?
-Whatever you want!

1229
01:46:43,916 --> 01:46:45,958
You can't give me what I want.

01:48:50,291 --> 01:48:52,291
Is it a crime to think about my future--

1261
01:48:59,416 --> 01:49:00,875
-Osman?
-Dolly.

1262
01:49:00,958 --> 01:49:03,583
-Osman, wake up.
-Dolly!

1263
01:49:06,416 --> 01:49:07,333
Amit...

1264
01:49:08,583 --> 01:49:09,416
Move aside!

1265
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:40,833
{\an8}DIRTY TRADE

1266
01:51:09,166 --> 01:51:10,958
You did it in our bedroom?

1267
01:51:11,958 --> 01:51:13,125
On our bed?

1268
01:51:18,041 --> 01:51:19,916
I don't know who will bury him.

1269
01:51:22,333 --> 01:51:23,833
You've gone mad, Dolly!

1270
01:51:24,250 --> 01:51:26,708
Making that "child" your lover!

1271
01:51:27,541 --> 01:51:29,375
You're just like your mother.

1272
01:51:32,208 --> 01:51:33,041
What?

1273
01:51:33,458 --> 01:51:34,583
Where are you going?

1274
01:51:35,916 --> 01:51:38,041
What does he have that I don't?

1275
01:51:38,208 --> 01:51:39,750
Is it because he's young?

1276
01:51:40,250 --> 01:51:41,708
You think I'm senile?

1277
01:51:42,833 --> 01:51:43,708
Tell me!

1278
01:51:44,083 --> 01:51:44,916
What?

1279
01:51:45,375 --> 01:51:47,166
Don't I satisfy you?

1280
01:51:47,791 --> 01:51:48,708
Huh?

1281
01:51:49,833 --> 01:51:51,041
What about my needs?

1282
01:51:51,541 --> 01:51:53,125
Ever thought about me?

1283
01:51:54,583 --> 01:51:57,250
Will you keep sleeping
with young boys all your life?

1284
01:51:58,375 --> 01:51:59,791
Think you'll be young forever?

1285
01:51:59,916 --> 01:52:01,958
You tried to touch Kaajal!

1286
01:52:03,666 --> 01:52:04,708
That was wrong.

1287
01:52:05,208 --> 01:52:08,041
I only tried. But you?

1288
01:52:09,041 --> 01:52:11,625
That was consensual.
We didn't force each other.

1289
01:52:14,500 --> 01:52:15,333
Okay,

1290
01:52:15,625 --> 01:52:17,041
I admit I was wrong.

1291
01:52:17,583 --> 01:52:20,708
Don't know what I was thinking.
I was frustrated, Dolly.

1292
01:52:21,125 --> 01:52:23,083
We hadn't had sex for two years

1293
01:52:23,166 --> 01:52:26,208
-That's not Kaajal's fault.
-Listen to me.

1294
01:52:27,958 --> 01:52:29,333
I'll get treated.

1295
01:52:30,125 --> 01:52:31,791
Counseling, therapy, anything...

1296
01:52:31,875 --> 01:52:34,083
I'll find a better paying job.

1297
01:52:34,166 --> 01:52:35,625
You want more money, right?

1298
01:52:35,708 --> 01:52:37,875
Money? I arrange it all the time.

1299
01:52:38,583 --> 01:52:40,458
And you never ask me how.

1300
01:52:41,833 --> 01:52:43,833
I've never gotten a loan.

1301
01:52:44,708 --> 01:52:47,291
I pawn my jewelry,
steal from the office...

1302
01:52:47,750 --> 01:52:49,750
I ensure we make ends meet.

1303
01:52:51,583 --> 01:52:52,958
Don't look at me like that.

1304
01:52:53,541 --> 01:52:55,000
The truth hurts, doesn't it?

1305
01:52:55,666 --> 01:52:57,500
Forget all that, Dolly.

1306
01:52:58,416 --> 01:53:00,541
We'll get our new house,
our kids are young...

1307
01:53:01,666 --> 01:53:03,000
Anyway, he's dead.

1308
01:53:07,083 --> 01:53:08,958
Even during our honeymoon...

1309
01:53:10,833 --> 01:53:12,458
I hardly felt anything.

1310
01:53:13,875 --> 01:53:16,375
I thought things would
get better with time.

1311
01:53:18,708 --> 01:53:20,208
But they didn't.

1312
01:53:21,208 --> 01:53:24,000
I don't desire you, Amit.

1313
01:53:26,750 --> 01:53:29,125
This pretense
of being happy and smiling...

1314
01:53:32,916 --> 01:53:34,250
I can't do it anymore.

1315
01:53:45,416 --> 01:53:46,500
Where will you go?

1316
01:53:49,250 --> 01:53:50,083
I don't know.

1317
01:53:54,875 --> 01:53:56,416
Bharat, pack some clothes.

1318
01:54:02,083 --> 01:54:03,666
Come on, Bharat. We're leaving.

1319
01:54:07,875 --> 01:54:10,208
Pappu, wake up.

1320
01:54:14,375 --> 01:54:15,625
Hurry up, Pappu.

1321
01:54:31,125 --> 01:54:32,083
You were right.

1322
01:54:33,750 --> 01:54:35,250
I'm just like my mother.

1323
01:55:04,541 --> 01:55:07,333
OSMAN ANSARI - 5 STARS

1324
01:55:16,583 --> 01:55:17,416
Sir.

1325
01:55:18,375 --> 01:55:21,166
I was serious about what I offered.

1326
01:55:22,041 --> 01:55:24,875
All the other girls may quit,
but I'll stand by Red Rose.

1327
01:55:27,041 --> 01:55:28,750
My idea will be successful, sir.

1328
01:55:29,416 --> 01:55:30,833
I have full faith.

1329
01:55:32,958 --> 01:55:38,125
I'm proud to work as a voice operator
at the Red Rose Romance app.

1330
01:55:39,833 --> 01:55:42,166
As actors sell performances...

1331
01:55:42,666 --> 01:55:45,208
we sell romance through our voices.

1332
01:55:46,375 --> 01:55:47,958
As society modernizes,

1333
01:55:48,416 --> 01:55:50,416
people are more lonely than ever before.

1334
01:55:50,750 --> 01:55:52,750
And we try to fill that void.

1335
01:55:53,291 --> 01:55:57,500
And since women too, feel lonely...

1336
01:55:57,666 --> 01:55:58,625
we're going to...

1337
01:56:00,833 --> 01:56:04,291
launch the Ladies Special Red Rose app.

1338
01:56:07,250 --> 01:56:09,291
Greater Noida is the city of dreams...

1339
01:56:10,541 --> 01:56:12,291
and we girls, are its future.

1340
01:56:13,041 --> 01:56:13,875
Thank you.

1341
01:56:24,416 --> 01:56:26,125
-For me?
-Yes.

1342
01:56:50,666 --> 01:56:52,666
ROAD TO AGRA
