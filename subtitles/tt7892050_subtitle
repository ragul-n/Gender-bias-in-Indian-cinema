2
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,800
A town's look will change
every once in 10 years...

3
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,240
...just like how
a snake sheds its skin.

4
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,080
New settlements will emerge,
new buildings will come up,...

5
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,440
...bridges will get longer,
governments will change.

6
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,720
New criminals are born
and they indulge...

7
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,640
...in new unlawful activities.

8
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,760
The criminals we have now
are not mere shadows...

9
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,440
...that are only active
when it is dark.

10
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,280
The criminals we have now
come in many forms.

11
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,800
Entrepreneurs, father of
education, real estate king,...

12
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,600
...sand mafia and Senapathi.

13
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,640
Senapathi, a criminal
right from young.

14
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,360
For that, he spent a few years
in juvenile rehab centre.

15
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,920
Then he went on
to became a gangster.

16
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,680
At one point, he became
the gang leader.

17
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,960
Then he became an entrepreneur,
had political support too.

18
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,360
Then he reached heights
where no one could touch him.

19
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,560
The most powerful man
in the city.

20
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,960
You laughed and laughed
and you trapped me...

21
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,120
You blushed while
you read to me a story...

22
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,840
Is this how you sing
to all the women in your life?

23
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,440
40 years,...

24
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,840
...we've been through
highs and lows together.

25
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,040
There were others to accompany us,
knives, daggers and guns.

26
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,920
Other small fries,
not one or two but many.

27
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,880
We had our kids and others.

28
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,000
But in my eyes,
I only see you.

29
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,080
We are going to the temple.
We must not lie now.

30
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,400
What did you pray for?

31
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,320
"I forgot today is my anniversary.
My wife is angry.

32
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,120
I left my job and came
with her to please her.

33
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,680
Please help me appease her
and make her happy."

34
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,960
What did you ask for?

35
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,800
You lie a lot
and commit sins.

36
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,960
{\an1}I told God to forget
everything and protect you.

37
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,880
What did God say?
–He said He'll handle it.

38
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,160
He told me not to worry.

39
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,280
Vanakkam, sir.
It's sir.

40
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,160
Nagendran!

41
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,600
Go!

42
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,520
I made a mistake.

43
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,360
Do you mean no one makes
any mistake in this world?

44
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,480
I thought you're my man.
–That's true.

45
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,280
I'm eating because
of your father.

46
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,560
If you eat rice here, what do
you eat in Chinnappa's house?

47
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,320
Don't hit me.

48
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,920
I've admitted it.
–Wipe!

49
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,720
Chinnappa's men showed me
money and cheated me.

50
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,520
I have kids.
–How many kids do you have?

51
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,000
Two kids.

52
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,520
One is a good student.
Your father named them.

53
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,280
You could think
of your children.

54
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,360
I'm sorry, I made a mistake.
–There is a call for you.

55
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,680
My wife is calling.

56
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,160
How did she know your life
is in my hand?

57
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,800
Yes? What?
Mom too? Who?

58
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,800
Are they alive?
I'm asking if they are alive?!

59
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,520
Hello!

60
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,920
Yes, I am at the hospital.
–Tell him there were two men.

61
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,240
It seems two men came there.

62
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,120
What is it?
–The senior doctor just left.

63
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,120
It seems they are critical,
he asked to wait.

64
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,480
How could you let this happen?
–It wasn't in my hands.

65
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,640
He was supposed to go
to the lawyer's house.

66
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,720
It is their wedding anniversary.
He wanted to go to the temple.

67
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,400
He took Lakshmi along.
–Have you caught the person?

68
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,760
He is talking about it.
–I'm talking to the DCP.

69
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,240
They'll catch them.
–We pay them Rs20 lakhs a month.

70
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,560
Each station, each check post,
each officer,...

71
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,080
...they take our money.
Ask them why they let them go.

72
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,440
Arul, I'll talk to you later,
okay? Thank you.

73
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,320
Varadhan, the police did not do it.
They rented the vehicle...

74
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,080
...by saying
it was for a film shoot.

75
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,360
Must be Chinnappadasan.

76
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,600
Wait! Give me your hand.

77
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,600
How are they?
Are they badly hurt?

78
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,160
Why did you bring the kids here?
–Is mom hurt too?

79
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,160
Is there a carnival here?
–I can't lie and raise them.

80
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,760
Instead of finding out from others,
they should find out themselves.

81
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,640
Dad, keep.....
–Lakshmi has more injury than him.

82
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,360
Her face is badly hurt.
–Dad, keep an eye on them.

83
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,880
Come on.

84
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,920
I can't see them
in this condition.

85
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,720
Follow grandpa,
go and get something to eat.

86
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,760
Varadhan, your father is careful
when he has to decide...

87
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,360
...on matters
concerning Chinnappadasan.

88
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,720
Have you informed
Ethi and Thyagu?

89
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,920
It will be better
if you inform them.

90
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,720
It is a network from Kazakhstan
all the way to China,...

91
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:36,160
...for 1500 miles.
And we have excess to 7 blocks,...

92
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,600
...to 80% of the network.
–Excuse me, sir.

93
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,240
Your wife is here.

94
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,080
My wife is here.
Sorry, I'll be back.

95
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,040
God given boon,
I told you not to disturb me...

96
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,520
...when I'm drinking champagne.
I'm trying to strike a big deal.

97
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,640
Can you only do business with
those girls in skimpy clothes?

98
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,760
This is Dubai, Renu.
I can't make them go naked.

99
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,720
I can't laugh.
Can we just go back?

100
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,000
Land?
–Yes.

101
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,120
What was the emergency
to come out here on boat?

102
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,760
Okay, you won.
Tell me what it is.

103
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,240
Call your parents in Chennai
and ask them.

104
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,080
They'll tell you about the attack
that was launched against them.

105
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,000
Renu, what happened to them?

106
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,520
I have work.
–Renu!

107
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,680
Call Chennai and ask.

108
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,360
Renu!

109
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,800
Thief...

110
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:56,680
You will come...

111
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,640
Come and see me...

112
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:10,680
Win my life...

113
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,600
I am a thief...

114
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,080
I am a thief...

115
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,440
You will come...

116
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:47,680
Come and see me...

117
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:54,800
Win my life...

118
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,320
Handsome, Maara,
let me pass...

119
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,840
Handsome, Maara,
don't give in...

120
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,320
Handsome, Maara,
abide...

121
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,680
Handsome, Maara, forgive...

122
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,760
Your phone has been ringing
for a long time. Should I answer?

123
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,040
No.
–It's Varadha.

124
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,800
Okay, ask him what he wants.
–He wants to know what it is.

125
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,080
Where are you?
–What does he want now?

126
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,960
He wants to know what you want.
He's been calling for 8 hours.

127
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,400
What is the problem now?
–He wants to know...

128
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,480
...what the problem is.

129
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,880
Your parents are in the hospital.

130
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,160
Chinnappadasan's men
attacked them.

131
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,440
They are critical.

132
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,520
Should I come?

133
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,040
Varadhan!

134
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,480
Mother Lakshmi?
She's not in danger.

135
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,840
She is conscious.
But lots of injury on her face.

136
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,640
Want some water?

137
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,360
Driver? Nagendran?

138
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,280
I'll go and get the doctor.

139
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,400
I'll make it alive.

140
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,480
Until I come out,
I want you to take over.

141
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,120
PM is going up.
Our house new PM is here.

142
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,560
PM?

143
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,160
Jayanth is watching from behind.
–Let him watch.

144
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,040
He should know
how much we love each other.

145
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,200
I had to stay overnight
to look after them.

146
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,640
Your sister did not come.
No one was there.

147
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,240
You weren't there either.
Where did you do?

148
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,960
Jayanth would have understood
that love only lasts 7 seconds.

149
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,160
Get down and take
the car behind.

150
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,600
You want the PM's wife
to get down?

151
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,040
Shall I take an auto or Uber?

152
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,160
Call Rasool.

153
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,240
Ask him if he knows about
the two men who bombed the car.

154
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,400
I want to know
if the police found them.

155
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,960
Your friend is rejecting the call.
–Call him back again.

156
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,480
Fractured skull,...

157
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,120
...four broken ribs,...

158
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,680
...abdominal tear,...

159
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,040
...multiple fractures
on the right finger.

160
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,240
Yes, madam.
–Are you crazy?

161
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,080
Sir, he is not only
a college student.

162
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,160
He is a criminal,
scum and gangster.

163
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,720
Didn't you see his student ID?
–Sir, if you pay Rs150,...

164
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,720
...anyone can get a college ID.

165
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,320
Which student goes to class
with a gun in his pants?

166
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,680
Rasool, we are in public view.
Everyone is watching us,...

167
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,680
...from the media to politicians.
This has happened...

168
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,680
...when the PM
is visiting the city.

169
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,600
Sir, I asked him for the gun
very respectfully.

170
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,360
He spoke ill about my sister.
I told him not to speak...

171
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,480
...ill about my sister
as she was average looking.

172
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,600
He didn't laugh
at my joke at all.

173
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,080
Then he spoke about my mother.
I spoke to him in English.

174
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,560
I said, "Brother, don't speak
about my mother, she is old."

175
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,240
I even said she has knee pain.
He smiled lightly.

176
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,440
His friends laughed. Then he put
his hand on my shoulder,...

177
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,160
...he said I was his friend
and not a true police officer,...

178
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,280
...he laughed and said I joined
the department by mistake.

179
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,480
That's when I hit him.
–Why?

180
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,240
I wore a fresh uniform that day.
I collected it from laundry...

181
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,360
...only that morning.
His hands were stained,...

182
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,120
...he messed my uniform.
I got carried away.

183
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,240
So I smacked him.
–What should we do to him now?

184
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,120
He must be locked away.

185
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,000
We must nip people like
him in the bud.

186
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,080
How did you become a police
officer? Who recommended you?

187
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,680
Through merit, sir.
–Rubbish!

188
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,480
What's your father's name?
–AH Basheer,...

189
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,880
...retired chemistry professor.
–He's your uncle who adopted you.

190
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,160
Your father was Ebrahim, a criminal
who was shot dead by the police.

191
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,080
Am I right?
It's all in the records.

192
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,360
Yes.
–Your mother gave you up...

193
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,080
...and killed herself.
–That was an accident, sir.

194
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,920
Rasool, until the boy recovers,
you need not come to work.

195
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,160
The suspension order
will be sent to your house.

196
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,360
Madam, this is not fair.
–Do you have faith in God?

197
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,000
Madam, my mother's.....
–Call her aunty.

198
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,640
We can't run the family
with my aunt's income.

199
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,440
My uncle is going for dialysis.
–If the boy dies, that's it.

200
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,360
You can bury your uniform for good.
–This isn't fair at all.

201
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,680
Please reconsider.

202
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,160
I won't be able to run
my family if I get suspended.

203
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,880
You can go.

204
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,720
No one told me you're coming.
–I'm here. Where is Varadhan?

205
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,320
Tell him I'm here. Go on!
–Wait, sir.

206
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,920
{\an3}This is Narasu's Mill,
the squatters surrounding it.

207
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,880
{\an3}All signed and sealed.

208
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,840
{\an3}Your Astro City,
factory, lake...

209
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,240
{\an3}...and mall, all are getting
cleared one by one.

210
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,040
How much did you close
the deal for, Ranjith?

211
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,160
Market rate,
45 for each acre.

212
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,640
But I said Varadhan
could only offer 27.

213
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,200
I asked him if agreed.
Seth was dumbfounded.

214
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,800
He said he wouldn't be able
to afford it.

215
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,320
{\an3}My brother and I got into
our car. Then he agreed.

216
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,600
{\an3}He agreed at 27 because of you.
–How much did you quote?

217
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,160
17.
–17?

218
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,760
{\an3}But he's saying it is 27.

219
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,960
You're saying it is 17.
Doesn't add up.

220
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,040
{\an3}You wouldn't have done anything.
Did your brother do something?

221
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,800
Call him.

222
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,480
He is not reachable.
–Fool!

223
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,680
{\an3}When you smacked him,
did you destroy his phone?

224
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,440
Open and check.
Hang on.

225
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,200
Arun!

226
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,440
What have you done?
Do you have any sense?

227
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:58,400
Hey! It is too noisy.
Kill him fast.

228
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,880
What is this? I'm hearing things
I shouldn't be hearing.

229
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,840
I didn't hear anything.
–What? Come here!

230
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,200
Come closer.
Did you hear that?

231
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,000
Go! Go!

232
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,920
{\an3}Return the Rs10 for each acre
that you took to Jayanth.

233
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,520
Dude!

234
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,200
Varadhan! Hey, friend!
–Hey!

235
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,760
{\an3}Don't do anything when there
is a police officer around.

236
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,160
{\an3}You're no longer
a police officer.

237
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,800
{\an3}I heard that you're suspended.

238
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,280
Do you have eyes and ears
in the police department?

239
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,120
You get news at
the sound of speed.

240
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:52,000
Do you know
why I came to see you?

241
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,040
The Home Minister
is your friend, right?

242
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,880
Ask him to call the lady
commissioner and pressure her.

243
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,640
Dude, when I call you,
you won't answer.

244
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,600
{\an3}Why must I help you now?

245
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:06,000
{\an3}You are my buddy.
You must help when I ask you.

246
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,320
{\an3}We are best friends forever,
we studied and copied together,...

247
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,600
...you even rescued me
all the time.

248
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,440
If you ever want a kidney,
tell me, I'll give you mine.

249
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,280
Kidney? Are you drunk?

250
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,560
For a good man,
even booze is weapon for him.

251
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,680
Call the Home Minister.

252
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,120
Call the man!

253
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,720
I will talk to the minister.
But I need something from you.

254
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,200
{\an3}I know. You want to know
who planned to kill your father...

255
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,200
{\an3}...throwing the bomb at him.
Right? I'll work on it.

256
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,720
6 months suspension?
–Yes.

257
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,120
I'll handle it.
–Thanks, dude.

258
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,360
I'll handle it.

259
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,000
Come here!

260
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,120
Balla!
–Balla Thyagarajan.

261
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,920
Take it off.
–Look.

262
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,400
Come on!

263
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,080
Thyagu!

264
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,880
Brother!

265
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,800
Please come with me.

266
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,080
Please come with me, sir.
–Why? What happened?

267
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,600
Please come with me.
–For what?

268
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,880
Please wait here.

269
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,280
My passport.
–Wait here.

270
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,640
Okay, go on.

271
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,640
You got scared, right?
–Sheikh!

272
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,920
Hey!
–Hi, kids!

273
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,200
I thought so.
–Really?

274
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,280
How are you?
–When are you due?

275
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,800
Anytime.
–Ethirajan, you got scared?

276
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:21,440
Uncle, I got scared.
You are terrible.

277
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,240
Your 3 kids were sitting
here all along.

278
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,880
Did they see me like this?

279
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,840
Why did you bring them here?
–How can I stop them?

280
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,360
They have gone to see dad.
Here, drink up.

281
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,480
Did you come thinking you would
see your dad survive...

282
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,000
...or did you think
I wouldn't make it?

283
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,880
The gap was so close it seems.
You would have died.

284
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,960
Remove this tube.....
–Dad!

285
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,640
Remove it.
I hate the smell of medicine.

286
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,440
I feel like puking.
Varadhan!

287
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,080
Make arrangements for me
to get discharged.

288
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,080
They said you must stay here
for a week. You can't go home.

289
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,120
I raised you well.
Why are you going by the book?

290
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,120
Mr. Senapathi,
you may be a powerful man.

291
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,960
But they broke your ribs
and brought you to the hospital.

292
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,720
Will you listen to your father
or the doctor?

293
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,960
He will only listen to the sheikhs
in Dubai and no one else.

294
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,520
One more sip.

295
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:35,440
Do I look like a demon?
–A bit like that.

296
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,840
Come on, drink up.

297
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,160
You're a bigger demon than me.
–That's how you raised me.

298
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,680
Who did this?

299
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,720
They did it badly.
So I asked.

300
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,000
You guys inherited
the arrogance from your mother.

301
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,280
Hello!
–Hello, dude, will you come...

302
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,880
...to the Red Light Area
in Pondicherry?

303
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,400
Rasool, are you drunk?
–Yes, I drank water,...

304
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,960
...coffee and tea. You?
–Okay, I'll call you later.

305
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,680
Fine, you're not in the mood.
Both boys here are in the mood.

306
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:29,560
They are lucky. Forget it.
–Hello!

307
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,640
Are you married?
–Yes.

308
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,720
Regular customer?
–Only once.

309
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:39,440
Once every day?
–Hello, which two guys?

310
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:44,160
The guys who threw the bomb
into your parent's car.

311
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,880
They are having fun
at the brothel in Pondicherry.

312
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,640
Okay, I'm on my way.

313
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,400
Hey!
–Take your time.

314
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,240
These two guys
are planning to camp here.

315
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,760
They attacked in broad daylight?
How is that possible?

316
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,520
My boys were there.

317
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,280
How could you let
this happen to dad?

318
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,000
Did I do it?
–Were we careless then?

319
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,840
Go back to Dubai
and be a yes–man there.

320
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,600
We'll handle things here.
–Brother, relax!

321
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,240
I am relaxed.

322
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:19,280
Hello, how are your parents?
–They are safe for now.

323
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,080
They are still in the hospital.
How are you?

324
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,840
Do you miss me?
–Didn't you run with the money?

325
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,560
Your father has lots of it.
If I ever run, it'll be with him.

326
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,760
Good.
–Uncle, call Rasool.

327
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,840
Confirm delivery. Okay, bye.
–Okay, I love you.

328
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:42,760
Say 'I love you'.
–Me too. Yes!

329
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,760
Dad almost died. Why must you
romance over the phone?

330
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:52,240
So what? Why do you bother?
–If you want to fight like kids,...

331
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,960
...take the next car.
–Okay, brother.

332
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:59,000
He thinks he is like father,
no wonder he is showing off.

333
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:04,160
I was talking about work.
–What work? Smuggling monkeys?

334
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,400
I wonder why
he drives this way!

335
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,560
Uncle, do you have Internet

Bank of Serbia.
Show this African monkey.

338
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,080
Brother, there goes if our baby
brother goes into business.

339
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,440
Hello, it's a credit balance.
All in dollars.

340
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,360
Do you know the exchange rate?
–Good heavens!

341
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,160
Where are you getting
the money from?

342
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,200
Why do you care
where it is coming from?

343
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,800
Any money is good money, bro!
–What business are you doing?

344
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,840
It's lucrative.
–Serbian chicken feed.

345
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,760
You're putting everyone at
risk, including father.

346
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,560
 Uncle is asking what you're doi
Tell him what it is.

347
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,440
This is the business.
–Hey!

348
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,160
What is this? Ethi!
–This is the business.

349
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,640
Where is it made?
–This is the first time...

350
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,280
...I'm seeing fear
in Varadhan's eyes.

351
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,400
Hold this.
–No, put it down.

352
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,000
He is dangerous.
We must cut ties with him.

353
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,760
Guns, grenades,
explosives, missiles.

354
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,320
What do you want? Name it!
We can deliver anything.

355
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,360
Made in Russia, comrades! Uncle!
–You're going to send us...

356
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,040
...to our graves.

357
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,360
Rasool!
–No problem here?

358
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,680
Are you here?
–Where are they?

359
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,720
One, over here. One, over there.
–Saras!

360
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,160
Saras, where are they?
–How are you?

361
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,240
Up!
–Ethi!

362
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,600
Rasool! Where are they?

363
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,360
Go over there.
–Check that room.

364
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,280
Why disturb me now?
–Go in.

365
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,040
Is anyone in that room?

366
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,440
Catch him! Thyagu! Ethi!
Catch the man in the red shirt!

367
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:17,800
He is getting away!

368
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,920
Thyagu, he's up there.

369
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,520
I'm on duty, sorry.
I have no money.

370
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,840
Thyagu, catch him!

371
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,200
Don't come close!
–Don't do anything to her!

372
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:10,600
If you come close, I'll shoot her.
–Shoot him!

373
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,080
Go or I'll shoot.

374
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,400
What did you do, Rasool?
–What am I to do?

375
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,840
Who sent you?
Is it Chinnappadasan?

376
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,000
Tell me!

377
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,800
How is he going to talk?
He is gone.

378
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,400
Why did you let the other man go?
–Do you know what happened there?

379
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,960
I want to meet Chinnappadasan.
–Do whatever you want.

380
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,200
Make arrangements.
Can you hear me?

381
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,040
Okay.
–Make arrangements.

382
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,840
Did they attack Senapathi?
Are they Chinnappadasan's men?

383
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:16,080
Did your men shoot him?
What are you doing here?

384
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,080
You haven't answered me.

385
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:24,320
Give me an answer.
–I'll tell you.

386
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:28,200
When? Give me a time.
–Soon.

387
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,280
How is your father?
–Serious.

388
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,120
Pull the tube off.

389
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:17,360
If it was me, I'd do that.
How long does he want to drag on?

390
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,760
Poor thing,
how long will you wait.....

391
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,800
Chinnappan!
–Lord! Sir!

392
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,600
Senapathi's three boys
are waiting for you inside.

393
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,520
Come in.
–Who is your ruling party...

394
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,600
...and opposition?
–Whoever pays me a fee,...

395
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,880
...they are my people.
Please come in.

396
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,280
DCP! Ages since I saw you.
What's up?

397
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,680
You guys may have
to be quiet for some time.

398
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,800
I came to say that.
–What we should...

399
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:59,760
...and shouldn't do.....
Can I have this seat?

400
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:03,800
Say that first.
–The harbour deal, real estate,...

401
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,320
...rowdyism
and illegal arbitration.....

402
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:11,440
I'm on penance for the Lord.
Aiyappa, help me up!

403
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,840
Raise me up!

404
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:42,000
Lord! How is Senapathi?

405
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,560
When can I meet him
at the hospital?

406
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:50,800
It seems they have visiting hours
and I can only visit him then.

407
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,640
Is that true?
–He is in ICU. No one can see him.

408
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,080
Two of your men got caught
in Pondicherry yesterday.

409
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,560
One escaped.
–One died.

410
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:05,600
What are you saying? My men?
Do you know what you're saying?

411
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,120
Yes, I don't know.

412
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,400
There shouldn't be
any problem now.

413
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,440
That is why I called
for this meeting.

414
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,840
DCP, that's an old table.
Father bought it during his time.

415
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,480
Varadha, Senapathi and I have been
working together for years.

416
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,440
We've had many problems,
fights, attacks and murder.

417
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,400
We have been to every level.

418
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,960
But I don't use explosives.

419
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:41,360
I swear upon my father,
I did not order Senapathi's death.

420
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,040
That is why I called
both of you to talk.

421
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,280
There shouldn't be any
problem between both groups.

422
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,200
Who started it? Did I?
–We didn't do this.

423
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,400
That is what I keep saying.

424
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,160
How can we be sure those fake
police officers are not his men?

425
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,480
Chezhiyan, what are you saying?
–He's saying he did not do it.

426
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,160
Are you deaf?
–Did you do it then?

427
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:10,920
Calm down!
–What will happen?

428
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,120
Counsel, you brought me here
to talk to the DSP.

429
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,560
Did you bring me here
to talk to these brutes?

430
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,640
What am I saying and
what are you talking about?

431
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,680
The police department
won't keep quiet.

432
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,640
They will destroy
your whole group one day.

433
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,320
That won't be necessary.
I'll handle this group.

434
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:29,880
I bet! I want to see what you do.
I've been trying to be patient.

435
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,680
They keep stepping my tail.
–Just leave him to me.

436
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,400
What will you do?
–I'll kill you.

437
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,920
Just go.
–Saw him threatening us...

438
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,120
...right in front of you?

439
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,760
Listen to him.

440
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,960
Vanakkam, sir.

441
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,040
Get in! Wipe your tears!

442
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,720
She just arrived.

443
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,760
She is fresh.
She is a young girl.

444
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,640
Thanks, sir.

445
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,640
Hey!

446
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,640
What have you studied?
Tell me.

447
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:30,520
Hey, the heart has turned red...

448
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,360
Hey, the heart has turned red...

449
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,480
Hey, the heart has turned red...

450
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,680
Hey, the heart has turned red...

451
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,680
Hey, the heart has turned red...

452
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,040
You did wrong things...

453
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,720
You did them intentionally...

454
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,200
You did everything wrong...

455
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,960
Saravana!

456
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,520
I want answers for three people.

457
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,600
For my son–in–law
who just passed away,...

458
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,920
...my beloved daughter
who is a widow now,...

459
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:24,400
...my grandson
who lost his father.

460
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,880
Is it me...

461
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,800
Who said and who did it...

462
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,280
Is it me...

463
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,720
Both are different people...

464
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,560
Is it me...

465
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,880
It was me.
Who else could it be?

466
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,240
Your brothers? Uncle?
–Give me the camera.

467
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,280
Answer.
–My brothers and the rest...

468
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,880
...won't do anything without me.

469
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,320
Is it me...

470
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,800
Who said and who did it...

471
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,600
Is it me...

472
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,480
He has two faces.
He is loving and caring.

473
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,120
He also has another face.

474
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,560
After father,
you must take his place.

475
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,080
If you take his place, Ethi,
it'll be like working...

476
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,800
...with a friend.

477
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,560
I will only come back as the king.
If I come back as the king,...

478
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:27,120
...I'll have hundreds of friends.
–That's your father's chair.

479
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,240
Let me sit.
–If your brother sees this,...

480
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,720
...he'll be angry, jealous
and he will yell.

481
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,160
Don't tell him then.
–You have a beautiful wife,...

482
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,160
...you have kids.
Why do you need me?

483
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:46,000
My father is everything there.
I'm just one among the men.

484
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,920
But here, I am a king.

485
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:52,840
Evil enters our mind slowly
like a tortoise...

486
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,240
It'll kill common sense,
it's addictive...

487
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,000
All the violence...

488
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,000
Our strength is...

489
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,680
The policeman is here too.
–I think the inspector is drunk.

490
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,040
420, I was a drunkard
before I became a policeman.

491
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,960
That is not important. I'll tell
you something as a policeman.

492
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:17,040
4 men, 2 guns and a vehicle
are waiting for you.

493
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,600
What shall we do?

494
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,960
Charging with baton became
the sound of music...

495
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,280
...in social communities...

496
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,960
Scars in unknown places
of the body...

497
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,320
...has become the identity
of certain people...

498
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:33,320
They saw us. Two of them.
The policeman too.

499
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,680
Run into the house.

500
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,320
Hey!

501
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,600
Dad!

502
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,840
Go inside!
–They are coming!

503
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,160
Get out of here!

504
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,240
Get the kids!

505
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,160
Thyagu!
–Go inside!

506
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,440
Thyagu! Come to me!

507
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:17,440
Where is he?
–Hit them!

508
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,480
Okay. The big fish got caught.

509
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,800
Put them in the car
and send them away.

510
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,360
Do you know
what is happening at home?

511
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,240
What nonsense are you saying?
–They took a shot at Thyagu...

512
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,640
...at our lawn.
–Our lawn?!

513
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,400
Check on him!

514
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,800
The lion will be asked to sit
on a chair in every circus.

515
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:22,200
I've been reduced to that.
Come on!

516
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,080
Give this old lion a hand.
I'll walk from here.

517
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:32,880
Thyagu told me what happened.
–It was Chinnappadasan's men.

518
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,120
I'll handle it.
–No, don't do anything.

519
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,960
Chezhi, do you know who threw
the bomb into the car?

520
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,080
We'll somehow
catch the man who got away.

521
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,520
He looks like an outsider.

522
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,400
Did you send someone
from your country?

523
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,880
Do you think I did it?
If you were in my shoes,...

524
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,120
...would you have done this?
Come on!

525
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,440
I'm from your mold.

526
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,280
Whatever you would do,
we will.....

527
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:15,920
Not only me, all 3 of us will do.
Good and bad, both.

528
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,080
Chezhi, I was arrogant
at his age.

529
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,880
Look how he is talking now.

530
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,800
Tell Chinnappadasan
I want to meet him.

531
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,440
Tell him I'll handle the man.
–No!

532
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:34,120
Tell him I would have met him
if I wasn't hurt.

533
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,480
We are going to look
at the molecular formula.

534
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,960
Reached safely.
–Remember each formula....

535
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:47,280
Hi!
–Go! Get out!

536
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,000
The queen of the big house!

537
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,680
She is having breakfast
at a policeman's house.

538
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:04,120
Your aunt's upma.
I couldn't resist.

539
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:11,200
Is your father–in–law
out from the hospital?

540
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:16,240
I heard you've been
suspended 6 months.

541
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,640
You're making ends meet with
your aunt's tuition fees, right?

542
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,680
Or are you using
the professor's pension?

543
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,080
Good point.

544
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:28,960
Bribe?
–Rs50,000 monthly...

545
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,080
...until the police inquiry
is over.

546
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,160
There are many bad apples.

547
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:37,440
Why are you tempting
a good police officer?

548
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,080
Senapathi has slowed down.

549
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,800
Chinnappa is slowly getting
out of control.

550
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,320
I don't want yesterday's
incident to take place again.

551
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,440
Your husband
was very lucky yesterday.

552
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:59,320
If two wives are beneficial,
two cars are also beneficial.

553
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,920
I don't know where
he came from yesterday.

554
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:08,080
He was in his small car,
they took a shot at his big car.

555
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:11,680
You are a good woman.
You did lots of good deeds.

556
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:16,040
It helped to save your husband.

557
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:21,320
I didn't do lots of good deeds.
I can't save him all the time.

558
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,080
That is why I'm asking you
if you'll be with Varadha.

559
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,440
Long life!
–Thanks.

560
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,560
Monthly salary won't work for me.
I prefer contract basis.

561
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,120
From hand to mouth.

562
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,680
Varadha shouldn't be hasty,
he needs a good friend.

563
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:43,080
Nice big talk,
but very little money.

564
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,960
I've given another
Rs40,000 to your aunt.

565
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:48,080
Or you'll use it to booze.
–You are very clear.

566
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:51,960
Why aren't you married?
–You have no younger sister.

567
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:54,480
So I didn't get married.
–Even if I had a sister,...

568
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:57,920
...how can I get her married
to a suspended police officer?

569
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:01,520
I'll look for someone else.
–God, don't do that!

570
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:04,440
Let me live alone,
enjoy life and die.

571
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,280
Okay, fine. The naming ceremony
will be held at home tomorrow.

572
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:12,560
Bring your aunt too.
–Keep an eye on Varadhan.

573
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,120
That's your duty.

574
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:28,560
You must name my baby today.
Mom and dad are not here.

575
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:33,520
You must name him.
–Raja!

576
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:37,600
You must live like a king.

577
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,240
Who is this girl in Serbia?
–Who told you?

578
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:48,000
Your father has people all over.
Is she Tamil?

579
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:51,320
Why didn't you bring her?
–I'm the youngest and not wanted.

580
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,360
I don't know if dad likes me.
How can I to bring Chaaya here?

581
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:59,720
Is her name Chaaya?
Nice name.

582
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:04,160
Hey!
–Grandpa!

583
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,760
Hello, police officer!
How are you?

584
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:10,160
They locked me up,
but released you.

585
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:13,120
But you still look strong.

586
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:17,280
If I bow down before a policeman,
he'll take the upper hand...

587
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:21,720
...and knock my head.
I have to be strong to survive.

588
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:10,280
How are you, Sena?
–I'm still alive and kicking.

589
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,880
The doctors tried to keep me
in the hospital.

590
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,680
But I have work to do.

591
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,480
I need to know who left me
temporarily redundant.

592
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:25,080
I told Varadhan in person
that I did not do it.

593
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:28,960
I told him I'm not involved.
But he refused to believe me.

594
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:33,320
Is that why you sent
those gunmen the other day?

595
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,240
God! Your 3 boys are standing
like 3 pillars, Sena.

596
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,840
But my son–in–law
is in his grave.

597
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,640
How am I to pacify my daughter?
Tell me.

598
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,960
You shouldn't have started this.
–I'm telling you again.....

599
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:08,400
I know you didn't do it.

600
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:16,040
You have nothing to gain.
I know who did it.

601
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,880
I'll handle it.

602
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,880
A policeman's eyes are bad.
–Mom!

603
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,040
 I lost half my si
after I got suspended.

604
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,480
How are you?
–You can't recognise me, right?

605
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,600
You fed me many times
when I was in school.

606
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,800
It's still fresh in my mind.
And I'm a policeman too.

607
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,280
How can I ever forget you?
–No showing off as a policeman.

608
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,160
If you come here,
you are Varadhan's school friend.

609
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,080
That's it. Okay?
–Yes.

610
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,640
Where is your aunt?
–She has tuition.

611
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,960
Eat before you go.
–Senapathi, if something...

612
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:46,080
...happens to you,
whom should I speak to?

613
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:50,960
Whom should I deal with?
The oldest, second or third boy?

614
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,840
Whom will you handover
the power to?

615
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,000
Tell me that first.

616
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:03,880
I'm only expecting
one thing from you. Peace.

617
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:12,560
Lord, are You listening?

618
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:18,440
Senapathi, all will go well.
Don't worry.

619
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,040
What is happening
in Senapathi's house?

620
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,920
Why are you asking me?

621
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:23,800
One call and you'll get
all the information.

622
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,240
Do you know how much
of property Senapathi has?

623
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,760
I don't know.
–Any party that forms...

624
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:29,760
...the government, he is the
proxy for all the ministers.

625
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:34,320
Not only that, he has lots
of properties in overseas.

626
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:41,800
It is a small criminal network.
–I know, sir.

627
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,720
The three boys will fight
with each other to take control.

628
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:47,920
When it comes to money and power,
siblings too will fight.

629
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:50,800
Why are you telling me?
–You're following their path.

630
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:55,920
Your friend, Varadhan, is trying
to take over Senapathi's place.

631
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:02,280
Am I right? Tell me.
–I won't, sir.

632
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:07,360
Why is it I don't trust you?
–I don't know, sir.

633
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:10,080
I'm an honest police officer.

634
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:17,320
I'll be always watching you.
Be careful.

635
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,120
Yes, sir.
May I go now, sir?

636
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,640
Must we tell him
who will be in power next?

637
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:33,800
This is why I said don't talk
to him. Did you pay heed?

638
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:36,920
I'll be in power after my father.
Ask him to talk to me.

639
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:41,640
Not you, you'll get mad.
I'll handle Chinnappa.

640
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:46,120
What do you know about this?
–He knows as much as you.

641
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,040
Hey, keep quiet.
–Okay.

642
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:51,160
You do small jobs. You either
be peddler and smuggle monkeys.

643
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:52,960
When you were
in the African prison,...

644
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,880
...I went to Delhi to speak
to the minister for your released.

645
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,080
Remember?
–Brother, what if he reminds us...

646
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,040
...of our mistakes?
–It's okay, he's our brother.

647
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:02,840
Let him talk.
–You talk very well.

648
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:06,800
Or would you have allowed
this to happen to mom and dad?

649
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:11,240
You're a yes–man in Dubai.
I take risk here and work.

650
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,840
If I don't send you money
every month, you'll be...

651
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:16,000
...on the streets of Dubai.
–This isn't fair.

652
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:20,040
You're not sending your money.
You're doing what father says.

653
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,360
What did you say?
–Stop it!

654
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,360
Chinnappadasan
did this to instigate us.

655
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:30,360
Don't make his dream come true.
–Who tried to kill father, uncle?

656
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,640
Ethi!
–No, I'm just asking.

657
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,880
If Chinnappadasan isn't around,
who else could it be?

658
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,240
Ethi, enough.

659
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,720
I'm going about my work.

660
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,520
But this question keeps
bugging me.

661
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:50,080
Without father,
who would benefit the most?

662
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:55,280
Not outsiders, but in our house.
–Ethi, won't you listen?

663
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,400
Enough.

664
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:00,960
No, mom, I wonder how long uncle
has been mad with dad.

665
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,640
Everyone knows
what dad did to your father.

666
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,520
Your Tamil vocabulary is good.
No wonder you're beating...

667
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:10,520
...around the bush.
Why don't you be straightforward?

668
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,520
"Uncle, did you try
to kill my father?"

669
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:18,520
Okay, answer me then.
–Yes, I tried to kill him.

670
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,520
So what?

671
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:23,680
Everything will go to your
son–in–law after my father dies.

672
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,480
He will take over the seat.
–Hey!

673
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,480
Before that, I'll kill you
and your brother.

674
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:31,360
Do whatever you can.
–You need not answer him.

675
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:36,840
Uncle, you're smart.
Even if we shoot you...

676
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,640
...in your mouth,
the bullet will not come out.

677
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:42,480
Do you know why? Because you
will swallow the bullet.

678
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:46,000
So many things have happened in
my family because of your father.

679
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:49,280
My father experienced things
that shouldn't have happened.

680
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:53,760
But your father
still has respect for me.

681
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:56,120
He has loved me
more than my father.

682
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,680
I will never forget that.
–Why can't you say that?

683
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,960
Let me go. Go!
–Come on, uncle!

684
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:13,800
I've been away
in the hospital for 4 days...

685
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,280
...and you guys are
fighting for my seat.

686
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:20,080
We were talking about
Chinnappadasan's visit.

687
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,600
I'll handle it. I told
Chinnappadasan to talk to me...

688
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,360
...if there is anything.

689
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:29,400
As long as I'm alive,
I'll be responsible.

690
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,040
After you.

691
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,040
You will know when it happens.

692
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,960
Those who came
from overseas can leave.

693
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:55,520
Go and learn to make a living.

694
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,960
Come on.

695
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,040
Only surgery wounds.

696
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:09,520
They will soon disappear.

697
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,800
I know who it is.

698
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:37,200
I know who ordered the bomb
to be thrown into our car.

699
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:41,560
Who? The police?
Is it Chinnappa?

700
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:46,000
My brother?
–No, poor thing, he is loyal.

701
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:47,840
He isn't smart enough
to think to that extent.

702
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:50,720
So.....

703
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,040
One of your sons.

704
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:14,440
I don't believe you.
–Satan is not outside.

705
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:19,320
He lives with us in the house.
–You are gravely mistaken.

706
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:31,960
Do you know why
your daughter is sharp?

707
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,960
There is a knife behind it.

708
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:45,920
The person whom we love the most
will stab us at the back.

709
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:50,240
But you are not close to anyone.
You're kept everyone...

710
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,640
...at the right place.

711
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,080
Shall I tell you who it is?
–No.

712
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,280
What are you going to do?
Tell me.

713
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:12,280
That is what I am afraid of.

714
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:18,000
The man above
has showed me the way.

715
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,760
Don't worry, go to bed.

716
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,400
Which is first...

717
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:48,600
Which is last...

718
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:52,120
Will the endless sky
end at all...

719
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:54,280
It can't...

720
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:58,360
Like the human form,
will our soul die too...

721
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:03,160
The vessel called body
would break...

722
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:07,440
Oh wailing heart,
do not worry...

723
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:12,600
When leaves fall,
the tree won't perish...

724
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,200
Like a lower form of life...

725
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:17,240
Live life everyday...

726
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:22,120
The world...

727
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:28,440
Isn't permanent...

728
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,920
Here you are.

729
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,880
What happened?

730
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:06,360
Can't you sleep?

731
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:09,600
Honey!

732
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:15,680
Honey!

733
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:19,440
Varadhan! Chitra!
–What happened?

734
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:21,920
Go up and get them! Hurry!
–Sir!

735
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,040
Varadhan! Call the doctor!
–What happened?

736
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,440
It's dad.
–What happened to him?

737
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,960
I don't know.
–Dad! What happened, mom?

738
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:32,080
I don't know.
–Dad!

739
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:36,800
Call the doctor. Dad!
–Dad!

740
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:40,440
Honey!
–Call the doctor fast.

741
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:43,600
Call the doctor.
Call for an ambulance.

742
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:49,680
Mom, don't be afraid.

743
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:52,920
Dad!

744
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,760
In the sound
of human's warfare...

745
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:59,200
Where could
the koel's sound be heard...

746
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:03,240
Where could
the koel's sound be heard...

747
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,520
When a fish cries in sea...

748
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:11,640
Will it be heard
in the shore...

749
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:18,400
In the blue mountain valleys...

750
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:26,160
Where the gentle breeze
does it's weaving...

751
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:31,200
While the sky bends
and touches the land...

752
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:34,360
I was understanding love...

753
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:38,280
In the vast silence
where even music freezes...

754
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:41,440
I was gathering knowledge...

755
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:45,360
I had spread my heart
wide open...

756
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:48,520
I was engrossed
in nature...

757
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:53,720
A sparrow
with its friendly glare...

758
01:00:56,120 --> 01:01:01,360
Sitting on a round rock,
it asked me to join her...

759
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:04,920
Chirp chirp, she said...

760
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,720
Come closer, she said...

761
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:10,200
Without any words,
she asked if I liked her...

762
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:11,960
Chirp chirp, she said...

763
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:13,720
Come closer, she said...

764
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:17,360
Without any words,
she asked if I liked her...

765
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:22,840
In that small sparrow's drama...

766
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:26,560
I was a little engrossed...

767
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,880
Wrong number.

768
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,560
Where have you been?
I've been trying to reach you...

769
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,080
...for a long time.
–What is it, uncle?

770
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:42,600
Your father passed away.

771
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,800
Heart attack.

772
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,200
Your mom found him.

773
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:52,160
Please come immediately.
–Why all of a sudden?

774
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:56,520
He was recovering.
So many of you were there.

775
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,520
What were you doing.....
Couldn't you get a doctor?

776
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,840
Why didn't you rush him
to the hospital?

777
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:04,360
Both of you
must come immediately.

778
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:07,520
Uncle, tell him
I'll be there tomorrow.

779
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:17,320
Thyagu will arrive tomorrow.
He wants you to wait till then.

780
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,360
Why?

781
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:27,760
He has a meeting with the Arabs.
He can't come now.

782
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:31,200
Must we wait
till the meeting is over?

783
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:39,120
Meeting and contract are
not our responsibilities, right?

784
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:45,600
Don't send.

785
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:48,720
I don't what any money sent
to Thyagu without my knowledge.

786
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:07,960
Do you love your father that much?
–I don't love anyone.

787
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:09,920
If I love someone,
something happens to the person.

788
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:12,640
So I always keep a distance.

789
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:16,000
Can you take me to your house?

790
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,480
Not this time.
–Why not?

791
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:25,960
Will they think misfortune
fell upon the family...

792
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:28,440
...as soon as I walked
into the family?

793
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:34,880
Where are you going?
–Where am I going?

794
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:39,440
You are going home without me.
I'm only going to smoke.

795
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:46,040
Ethi, do you at least love me?
Or am I at arm's length too?

796
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
I love you.

797
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:01,600
Chaaya!

798
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:14,920
Chaaya! I love you, Chaaya!

799
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:07,400
Who sent you?

800
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:11,480
Tell me!

801
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:32,400
Is it Thyagu?
Is he coming? Hello!

802
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:35,120
Did you stop the money transfer?
–Your father's funeral...

803
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:37,520
...is going on here. Why are you
in a meeting with the sheikhs...

804
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:40,320
...in Dubai
instead of being here?

805
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:44,120
Didn't I say
I'll take the next fight out...

806
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:48,720
...after you transfer the money?
–I can't transfer now.

807
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:54,560
That is father's money.
He promised to send me the cash.

808
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,320
I'll give you 15 minutes.

809
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:00,120
Tell me you'll transfer
the cash by then.

810
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:02,520
I'm going to scatter
father's ashes in the sea.

811
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:05,920
Brother, you must
send me the money.

812
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:10,600
Or you're going to see
the end of you.

813
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,400
You should have
been here, Thyagu.

814
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:29,960
Okay, the money is here.

815
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:35,120
Thank you. It'll be here.
Need some time.

816
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:46,200
{\an3}One chapter is over, right?

817
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:49,400
That's what life is, right?

818
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:55,440
Did you hear about Ethiraj?
–Heard it was a sniper attack.

819
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:58,440
And she was a Tamil girl.

820
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:01,320
I'm thinking
about sending my uncle.

821
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:06,520
How did that happen?
Could it be your work?

822
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:10,760
{\an3}You have no siblings.
You won't know these things.

823
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:14,160
{\an3}Even if I'm suspended,
I'm still a police officer.

824
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:15,920
{\an3}My job is to
be suspicious of everyone.

825
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:17,680
{\an3}If you are in
Ethi's place,...

826
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,600
...you will have suspicions,
you will feel angry too.

827
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:21,400
Why would I want to be
in Ethi's place?

828
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:23,600
{\an3}He didn't even come
for his father's funeral.

829
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:28,600
Point.

830
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:30,920
{\an3}Thyagu didn't come either.
Why are both of them busy...

831
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:34,440
...at the same time?
Think this way.

832
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:36,800
The man who does the last
rites will be the heir.

833
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:39,640
If they come, I'll lose importance.
Could Chezhiyan have thought...

834
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:41,720
...this way and
could he have done it?

835
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:45,200
No?

836
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:53,640
Why did the sky fall
on the ground...

837
01:08:55,560 --> 01:09:00,920
Why did directions melt
in the rain...

838
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:07,880
I lost the direction
in which the sparrow flew...

839
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:15,080
I got separated from her,
carrying the burden of sorrow...

840
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:19,760
I parted with her...

841
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:22,400
My life drenched...

842
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:26,600
I parted with her...

843
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:29,840
My life drenched...

844
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:35,440
Will that little bird
wander around...

845
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:39,760
...strain itself and struggle...

846
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:51,800
Ethi, I heard about Chaaya.

847
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:57,600
It didn't even occur to you
to call me, right?

848
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:02,360
I didn't know how to pacify you.

849
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:07,720
I'm sorry, our family
is going through a rough patch.

850
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:12,200
Do you know Varadhan has taken
over the business back home?

851
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:16,360
Uncle is with him, right?

852
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:21,320
You must take dad's place.

853
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:26,240
But father
did not think that way.

854
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,640
Hey, go to bed.

855
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:38,200
Very good!

856
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:02,160
Who are you?
–Where is Thyagu?

857
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:06,920
Emergency. There are
4 armed men in my house.

858
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:11,360
Varadhan is not as smart
and brave as father was.

859
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,400
He only followed orders.

860
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:16,240
But you have a balance,
you are brave and...

861
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:23,160
...and have commanding power.
You have a distant vision.

862
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:29,040
Ethi, I've been praising
Arabs and Englishmen for years.

863
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,800
So, don't try
the same trick with me.

864
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:34,680
If you talk this way,
I'll have to ask myself...

865
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,480
...what you'll gain from it.

866
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:39,320
Saw that?

867
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,800
Varadhan doesn't have
this intelligence.

868
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:46,400
If he had told this, we would have
hugged him and felt happy.

869
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:48,840
Where is Thyagu?
–How would I know?

870
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:52,600
Do you tell your wife
before you go out?

871
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:55,800
Okay, guys, come fast! Let's go!
–Run! Go!

872
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:59,200
The cops are here! Go!
Run, you thieves!

873
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:02,080
Go! Run!

874
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:07,600
The guys who came just left.
–What's the problem?

875
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:09,400
I don't know.
4 guys came here.

876
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:11,240
They just left.
They are down there.

877
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,800
You can go and check.
–4 guys?

878
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,920
What's your name?
–My name is Renu Thyagarajan.

879
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:17,840
Excuse me! What are you doing?
My kids are upstairs!

880
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:21,080
Excuse me! What are you doing?
You can't go there!

881
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:25,600
Are you scared, Thyagu?
–I'm happy.

882
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:29,080
Renu, kids, my business.
I'm happy.

883
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:31,560
Can't you see?

884
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:34,040
You can go home.
You can fight all you want.

885
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:36,440
I won't get involved.

886
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:44,480
I was mistaken.

887
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:46,880
I thought you'll make us
global players.

888
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:51,840
Yes, you were wrong.

889
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:53,640
You've been
a yes–man to the Arabs,...

890
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,440
...your head is empty now.

891
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:58,680
Enough!
–Okay, enough!

892
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:02,200
Let Varadhan handle everything.

893
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:22,760
They have done it,
the guys who came in just now.

894
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:25,480
No, this is your bag.
–No, I don't know.

895
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:28,440
The guys who came must have.....
–No.

896
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:30,920
No, it is not mine.
Please understand this.

897
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:45,320
Okay, if I come with you,
this is my condition.

898
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:48,080
You must listen to me.

899
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:51,080
If we go together
and secure the seat.....

900
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:54,800
We will.
–If we do secure it,...

901
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:58,640
...it'll be my seat.
You have to listen to me.

902
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:02,400
Okay.

903
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:15,520
Renu!
–What happened?

904
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:19,560
Without any knowledge...

905
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:23,920
...of our destination...

906
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:29,840
The raindrops falling over...

907
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:34,360
One over the seed...

908
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:41,760
One over the dead...

909
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:47,880
It is destiny...

910
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:52,120
The search for fate
is indeed destiny...

911
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:57,120
Destiny...

912
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:00,920
It surrounds...

913
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:06,320
When its heartless,
blood surrounds...

914
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:11,320
Blood surrounds...

915
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,640
You are where
I am supposed to be.

916
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,960
I am where
you are supposed to be.

917
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:20,680
Renu!

918
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,080
Kids?

919
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:27,080
Your mother is
looking after them.

920
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:29,880
Send them to London
with my mom.

921
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:40,800
Varadhan is behind this.

922
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
I won't let him go.

923
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,800
Until then,
you'll be safe here.

924
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:51,160
Why don't you stay here too?

925
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:06,720
I've been slandered.

926
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:29,240
Jayanth, put the phone inside.
–Sure.

927
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:31,120
Come with me.

928
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:36,200
More salt.

929
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:40,680
Hey!

930
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:51,280
I'll handle it.

931
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:56,520
Coming!

932
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:07,320
I'm shivering as if the college
principal caught me.

933
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:16,680
Won't your parents
feel ashamed of you?

934
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:21,320
When I was 5, mom left us
and went with another man.

935
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:24,080
Take a seat.

936
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:27,560
When I was 18, I left my dad.

937
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:31,120
My sister is a doctor,
CMC Vellore.

938
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:32,720
Brother is in US, software.

939
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:36,760
I'm here alone.
Varadha, look who is here.

940
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:39,120
How much does he pay you
every month?

941
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:43,360
How much do you think he pays me?
Not even one paise.

942
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:48,520
I earned everything.
He gets everything free here.

943
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:52,760
But he cooks
fish curry very well.

944
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:57,120
Varadha, come and see who is here.

945
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:08,280
My nuptial chain
may last another 2–3 days.

946
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:12,720
 Rasool, I'll call you ba

947
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:16,560
Both your brothers are on their
way back. Do you know that?

948
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:21,200
Did uncle tell you?
–I bet you can't see.

949
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:23,400
You can't hear.

950
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:25,000
You're having fun
with a television girl...

951
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:28,680
...during the day. How will you
know what's happening around you?

952
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:32,880
Look, anyone can shoot you
through this window.

953
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:36,600
But you're here at this girl's
feet like a sacrificial lamb.

954
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:40,840
What are you going to do?
–I'll handle it.

955
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:44,000
How are you going
to manage your brothers?

956
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:46,880
What will you do?

957
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:51,360
I've made the arrangements.
They are trying to come...

958
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:53,000
...via Kathmandu
without our knowledge.

959
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:57,240
They won't reach here.
Rasool will handle it.

960
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:02,040
Yeah, Bay Three.

961
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:28,960
Passport please.

962
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,200
Please step aside.

963
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:35,800
Officer, I think
you're making a mistake.

964
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:37,800
Nepal police officer,
you're doing a big mistake.

965
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:39,840
Don't treat Indians badly.

966
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:43,360
Do you know who they are?
Ethiraj, from Serbia.

967
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:46,520
Thyagarajan, from Dubai.

968
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:48,280
They are gangsters.

969
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:51,240
No, take them.
–Take them.

970
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,800
Hey, don't touch me.
Officer, you're making a blunder.

971
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:15,560
Stand up.

972
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:22,600
Look there.

973
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:26,160
Look there.

974
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:41,720
Are you happy?
Where will this end?

975
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:44,120
You told me to be careful.

976
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:14,480
Can't you hear?

977
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:18,040
Darling!
Where are you, darling?

978
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:23,040
Come, lots of work in my town.

979
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:27,320
Khalid!

980
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:35,400
Brother! You started this!
Don't forget!

981
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:52,680
We are coming.

982
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:56,000
Take care!

983
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:17,880
What does the suspended
inspector want?

984
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,520
I heard the tea you serve is good.
I came to have a cup.

985
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:24,120
Get me a cup of tea.
It's as good as him saying it.

986
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:26,160
Get me a cup.

987
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:30,560
Are you still on the take
from Varadhan?

988
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:32,520
Varadhan is a miser.

989
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:34,440
He won't pay
until you do the job.

990
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:36,400
You know him.
–Sickening!

991
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:41,960
I know why you came to see me.
–Look, you've made my work easy.

992
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:45,480
Tea, it's for me.
Thanks.

993
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:49,320
Go and tell Varadhan
it won't happen.

994
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:52,880
You just gave me a cup
of tea lovingly.

995
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,600
Before I could finish it,
you're driving me away.

996
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:57,160
Is this fair?
Shall I ask what I want?

997
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:58,880
Varadhan's brothers are coming.

998
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,480
We don't know
who is going to die.

999
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:04,240
Varadhan wants my support?
–Perfect.

1000
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:09,320
Have you finished your tea?

1001
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:18,520
You and Senapathi
agreed on something.

1002
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:22,560
You can go now.
Don't come back here again.

1003
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:26,800
This is not a tea shop.
Go on.

1004
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:29,320
I'll come to this house,
drink tea, I'll meet you,...

1005
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:31,200
...talk 5 minutes to you,
then I'll leave.

1006
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:33,160
Do whatever you want to do.

1007
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:38,640
Bye!

1008
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:52,800
Thyagu, I didn't agree as you
came to my house and asked.

1009
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:55,320
I'm not such a kind man.

1010
01:24:57,880 --> 01:25:00,400
One day, we'll become business
partners in Dubai.

1011
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:04,160
We'll do very well.
That will happen.

1012
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:08,360
I want my accounts settled.
That's all.

1013
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:13,600
When the 3 of you fight,
the oldest must fall.

1014
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:16,680
That's your responsibility.

1015
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:26,560
Varadhan, DCP Aruldas.

1016
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:30,720
Vanakkam, DCP.
–Control your brothers.

1017
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,920
The police department
is not like before.

1018
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:35,800
My brothers?

1019
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:38,280
We received information
that you are gathering...

1020
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:40,200
...all the local rogues in town.

1021
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:42,720
We won't know
what the brothers are doing.

1022
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:45,360
I'm saying this
out of respect for your father.

1023
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:48,440
DCP, my brothers are educated.
They won't do anything wrong.

1024
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:52,240
I'll handle this.
–Don't say I did not warn you.

1025
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:57,000
That is why I am saying.
–You've said it. Forget it.

1026
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,880
How many men to send?
–Jayanth and his men stay here.

1027
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:04,000
Send the rest with Kurup.

1028
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:08,120
Before something happens,
we must crush them.

1029
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:09,880
What if Thyagu and Ethi
are with them?

1030
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:16,400
Make sure
nothing happens to them.

1031
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:21,520
Kurup, where are you?

1032
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:33,960
Who is that?

1033
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:47,040
Sir, there isn't anyone here.
But someone has locked us in.

1034
01:26:57,160 --> 01:27:00,000
Come on!

1035
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:07,160
Stop it!

1036
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:09,520
I said stop it!

1037
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:11,920
It's his brother.
Don't touch him!

1038
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:13,960
What did my brother say
when he sent you?

1039
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:16,640
To shoot us, right?

1040
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:18,680
Shoot!

1041
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:23,440
Hey, put that down.
–I'm from Dubai.

1042
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:26,160
Dubai was a desert.
Nothing will grow there.

1043
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:31,040
There was no water or oil,
there was nothing there.

1044
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:36,640
But now, the past 25 years,
look what it has reached.

1045
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:42,040
We are the same.

1046
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:45,200
You can stay here and continue
to fight Varadhan's battles.

1047
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:51,600
Or you can think, be smart...

1048
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:54,520
...and come up in life.

1049
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:59,080
I'm not going to lock you.
Here's the key.

1050
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:03,600
But if you want
to progress in life,...

1051
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:08,480
...show me right now, leave
Varadhan and stand behind me.

1052
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:22,040
Mom! Old woman!
I'm hungry!

1053
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:28,280
Old woman!
Where did all of you go?

1054
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:32,800
I'm going to eat so much today.

1055
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:36,240
Mom, I'm hungry.

1056
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:48,480
Professor, if I catch you,
you had it!

1057
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:52,120
Mom!

1058
01:28:53,680 --> 01:28:55,440
Okay, I'll eat out.

1059
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:06,040
Inspector!

1060
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:10,560
Have you joined my brother
and turned into a gangster?

1061
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:15,840
Whom did you ask coming in?
–I rang the bell.

1062
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:19,480
Your father opened the door.
I came in. Am I right, sir?

1063
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:21,040
Give that to me.
–What?

1064
01:29:21,160 --> 01:29:23,000
Trying to scare me?
–Wait!

1065
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:26,640
Shoot me.
Try shooting a policeman.

1066
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:28,800
You know
what will happen to you.

1067
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:31,680
He is a college professor.
This is my aunt.

1068
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:34,440
And you tied up an old woman.
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

1069
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:37,760
Will any policeman come into
your house without a warrant?

1070
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:39,760
Will he tie up the women
in your house this way?

1071
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,560
That's the difference
between you and me.

1072
01:29:41,680 --> 01:29:47,320
God, you sure can get angry!
–Are you fine?

1073
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:51,200
Careful.
–We are animals.

1074
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:55,840
We grew up loving blood.
Go inside.

1075
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:04,280
It was like watching
Sivaji Ganeson's movie.

1076
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:12,360
How is Varadhan?
–Are there bullets in that gun?

1077
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:15,080
Hell! Hey!

1078
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:18,240
It is loaded.
–It is an old building.

1079
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:21,800
And I am drunk too.
I'm hearing double.

1080
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:25,880
What do you want?
–Rasool!

1081
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:32,200
How much do you want
to expose Varadhan?

1082
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:34,880
I can't do that,
he's my friend.

1083
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:37,440
I have something else for you,
which is special.

1084
01:30:37,960 --> 01:30:42,400
Veluthambi.
–Veluthambi?

1085
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:45,600
Someone threw a bomb into your
parent's car dressed as cops.

1086
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:48,360
We found them in Pondicherry
Red Light Area, right?

1087
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:51,320
One man was shot dead.
The man who shot him is Veluthambi.

1088
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:55,960
I caught him.
–Where did you catch him?

1089
01:30:56,800 --> 01:31:02,200
If you want anything, ask me.
Don't create a scene for nothing.

1090
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:05,120
If you pay me double the amount
your brother is paying me,...

1091
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:07,240
...I'll expose him.

1092
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:24,160
Hey buffalo, come on!
–Coming!

1093
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:28,200
Who is it?
–I'll go and check.

1094
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:30,280
Don't know who it is.
–Who is he?

1095
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:43,680
Who is he?

1096
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:46,520
Go and check.

1097
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:48,800
They wanted to kill our boss.
–He is still alive.

1098
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:52,360
Don't just watch!
What are you doing? Give!

1099
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:55,480
Don't shoot, he's alive.
–Give!

1100
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:01,280
Here! Bring him down!

1101
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:06,240
The police are coming!
–Go inside.

1102
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:09,600
Police! Go inside!
–Varadhan!

1103
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:19,640
Bring him down.
–Welcome, sir.

1104
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:21,880
What is happening here?
There are women living here.

1105
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,400
They are hung a corpse
in front of the house.

1106
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:26,920
What are you doing?
I want an answer.

1107
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:28,560
Call the Commissioner.
Bring him down.

1108
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:30,200
Take him away.

1109
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:39,600
Hello, Nawab, good morning.
–Listen to me.

1110
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:41,640
Tell me you love me
and I'll listen to you.

1111
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:45,760
Nawab! Wait, I'm coming.
–Listen to me,...

1112
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:48,040
...where are you going?
–Can you be patient?

1113
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:52,600
Hello! Don't open the door!
–I'll open the door.

1114
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:56,480
Parvathy! Hello!
I said, don't open the door.

1115
01:32:57,720 --> 01:33:01,680
We haven't met before.
I am Ethiraj.

1116
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:03,920
I know. What's up, Ethiraj?

1117
01:33:05,160 --> 01:33:08,360
Is my brother on the line?
Give him my regards.

1118
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:10,600
Hey!

1119
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:30,520
Where is uncle?
–Gone to see the Commissioner.

1120
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:37,600
Get the kids. Get them.

1121
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:39,920
This shouldn't happen
in your city, madam.

1122
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:47,000
How would we know? They tied
the corpse to our gate at night.

1123
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:49,600
12 of your men
work at the station in my area.

1124
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:54,760
Everyone is saying
they did not see anything.

1125
01:33:56,360 --> 01:33:57,800
I'm coming to your house now.

1126
01:33:57,920 --> 01:33:59,960
Buffalo! We were supposed to go
to the Commissioner's house.

1127
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:01,960
Where are you going?
–Please forgive me, sir.

1128
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:05,400
I have kids.
–I'll call you back, Madam.

1129
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:08,080
What happened to you?

1130
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:16,120
Vinod!

1131
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:20,920
What are you doing here?

1132
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:23,440
Where did I ask you to go?

1133
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:39,880
Thyagu, what is this?

1134
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:44,760
What?

1135
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:55,000
This is for sending
my Renu to jail.

1136
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:02,520
Did you do it or not?
Tell me.

1137
01:35:02,640 --> 01:35:07,320
Sit. Put on your seatbelt.
Sit properly, belt up.

1138
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:10,720
Let me go.
–What is happening here?

1139
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:12,640
Take care.
–Can you tell me at least?

1140
01:35:12,760 --> 01:35:14,560
Be patient,
don't be like the kids.

1141
01:35:14,680 --> 01:35:16,520
Where is Babu and Alwar?

1142
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:19,520
The guards are gone.
–Belt up. Look after the child.

1143
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:23,680
Where is uncle?
–Look after the baby.

1144
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:25,640
Go!
–Be careful.

1145
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:36,760
Where are you sending everyone?
–For protection.

1146
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:39,040
Next 2–3 days will be bad.
–I don't understand anything.

1147
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:42,080
I said I'll handle it.

1148
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:05,600
Where is my father?

1149
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:10,400
Where is my father?

1150
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:14,800
Where is uncle?
Where is he?

1151
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:33,040
Dad!
–Chitra, don't.

1152
01:36:33,160 --> 01:36:36,000
Dad!
–Chitra!

1153
01:36:36,120 --> 01:36:40,120
Hey, who did this?

1154
01:36:40,240 --> 01:36:44,440
Remove this!
–Ethi or Thyagu?

1155
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:47,000
I'm asking you.
–This is Ethi.

1156
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:51,280
Will you be happy?

1157
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:54,560
Will you be happy?

1158
01:36:54,680 --> 01:37:00,120
Will you be happy?
–What did you do to your uncle?

1159
01:37:00,240 --> 01:37:02,640
We didn't do anything
that your husband didn't do.

1160
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:05,320
Useless!

1161
01:37:08,680 --> 01:37:12,640
Why did you do this to him?
He's your uncle.

1162
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:16,080
You're saying that.
You started this game.

1163
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:19,760
Where are you right now?
–As if you don't know.

1164
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:22,160
I'm in your girlfriend's house.
Wait, I'll turn on the video.

1165
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:27,040
Come on!

1166
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:37,400
Smile!

1167
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:41,040
Can you see us?
I'm waiting for you.

1168
01:37:41,160 --> 01:37:43,560
If you have the guts,
come on.

1169
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:49,640
Varadhan, where are you going?

1170
01:37:53,560 --> 01:37:58,240
Chitra, get down.
–If you go, things will get worse.

1171
01:37:58,360 --> 01:38:00,200
If you want to go,
I'll go with you.

1172
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:03,040
I'm asking you to get down.
–You'll kill each other.

1173
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:06,960
Enough! I've lost too much.

1174
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:11,880
Give me the gun.
I'll go and talk to him

1175
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:27,160
Don't take that.
–If you say that,...

1176
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:29,120
...the more I want it.
–It doesn't belong to you.

1177
01:38:29,240 --> 01:38:32,280
Pictures of Varadhan?
Your intimate moments together?

1178
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:35,040
Maybe. Must you watch it?
–Can't I watch?

1179
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:37,880
It belongs to your brother.
You can't take it.

1180
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:41,800
I had someone.
They took her away from me.

1181
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:45,800
So? Will you take whatever
that belongs to your brother?

1182
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:48,920
If the need arises, I will.

1183
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:56,560
Your secret lover is here.
Go on!

1184
01:38:59,160 --> 01:39:01,800
It's not Varadhan,
it's your mother.

1185
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:06,120
We were worried about you.
What are you doing here?

1186
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:09,240
Ethi is upstairs.

1187
01:39:21,480 --> 01:39:23,200
What is it, mom?

1188
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:42,080
Your elder son
has no guts to come here.

1189
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:45,960
Has he sent you as his messenger?
–Will you only talk to me...

1190
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:48,480
...in front of everyone?

1191
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:40,760
Mom, don't cry.

1192
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:43,440
I have never seen you cry.

1193
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:45,760
Don't make me see my own children
fight with each other.

1194
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,440
Have you come in support
of Varadhan?

1195
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:52,960
I'm talking for all 3 of you.

1196
01:40:53,320 --> 01:40:56,160
Then why did you come?
–To beg for alms.

1197
01:40:56,280 --> 01:40:59,200
What do I have?
I only have a cell phone...

1198
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:01,960
...and your eldest son's
secret lover. That's all I have.

1199
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:05,600
Come with me, that's all I want.
–You can't buy me over.

1200
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:07,600
I lost my father
in a cruel manner.

1201
01:41:07,720 --> 01:41:10,160
Then my husband.....
–I lost my Chaaya too.

1202
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,800
Did anyone come then?

1203
01:41:15,400 --> 01:41:17,360
Did anyone cry for me?

1204
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:23,840
In this house, everyone is selfish.
Dad raised us that way.

1205
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:28,720
You're a cruel man.
What should I do now?

1206
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:33,720
Give me back my mother.

1207
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:37,160
Don't take me away from here.

1208
01:41:38,280 --> 01:41:40,520
I want you, mom.

1209
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:42,880
You've never stayed
with me at all.

1210
01:41:46,360 --> 01:41:50,080
Stay with me.

1211
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:53,080
Just for a short while,
be my mother.

1212
01:41:54,240 --> 01:41:56,880
Only for me.

1213
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,840
Are you going to keep me here
as a captive?

1214
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:05,160
I'll keep my mother with me.

1215
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:10,240
With me, for my protection.

1216
01:42:18,840 --> 01:42:23,320
Brother!
I told you I'll come.

1217
01:42:24,520 --> 01:42:26,080
I'm here now.

1218
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:29,880
Where are you?

1219
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,240
Brother!

1220
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:37,280
Isn't anyone here to welcome me?

1221
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:39,480
Where is everyone?

1222
01:42:44,440 --> 01:42:46,120
Come on!

1223
01:42:54,480 --> 01:42:57,200
Okay, Varadha!

1224
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:08,800
No matter where you are,
we'll come looking for you.

1225
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:12,360
Bear that in mind.

1226
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:33,840
I shouldn't have sent mother.
I should have gone instead.

1227
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:40,560
I made a mistake.
–Don't make another mistake.

1228
01:43:40,680 --> 01:43:42,480
You have no more men,
no more muscle power.

1229
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:47,000
You are weak,
you'll get caught. Careful.

1230
01:43:47,480 --> 01:43:51,400
Let them come looking for you.
We'll plan something else.

1231
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:53,600
You took money from me,
now you're asking me to hide.

1232
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:56,320
Whom are you working for?

1233
01:43:58,160 --> 01:44:00,640
What do you want now?

1234
01:44:00,760 --> 01:44:03,280
Do you want me to save your
family...

1235
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:05,560
...or do you want me
to kill your brothers?

1236
01:44:05,680 --> 01:44:09,760
You have nothing to lose.
–Right, I have nothing to lose.

1237
01:44:09,880 --> 01:44:12,360
You are siblings,
you can do whatever you want.

1238
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:15,080
I'll sit back and watch.

1239
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:18,440
What did the poor ladies do?

1240
01:44:21,120 --> 01:44:23,000
Hi, Ethi.
–I'm outside your house, Rasool.

1241
01:44:23,120 --> 01:44:25,600
I see Varadhan's car here.
You could have hidden it.

1242
01:44:25,720 --> 01:44:28,280
How would I know you would come
with a ticket for his car?

1243
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:32,160
If you're outside, come in.
Where are you?

1244
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:35,000
I'm here.

1245
01:44:40,680 --> 01:44:43,160
Where is my brother?
–Which brother?

1246
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:46,720
I know one brother of yours who was
yelling from the roof of the house.

1247
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:51,160
The security called me.
–Where is my elder brother?

1248
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:54,560
Ethi, what did you say?
I couldn't hear you.

1249
01:44:54,680 --> 01:44:56,720
You couldn't hear?

1250
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:05,840
You've seen everywhere.
–I know that.

1251
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:14,560
Did they run away
after eating a few idlis?

1252
01:45:24,040 --> 01:45:28,280
The sound of Earth revolving...

1253
01:45:28,600 --> 01:45:31,400
The sound of ocean roaring...

1254
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:35,280
The sound of human's warfare...

1255
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:39,080
You would hear the koel chirp...

1256
01:45:39,400 --> 01:45:43,320
You would hear the koel chirp...

1257
01:45:43,720 --> 01:45:46,720
When a fish cries in sea...

1258
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:51,040
Will it be heard
at the shore...

1259
01:45:52,600 --> 01:45:54,840
Nellore route.
–Sure.

1260
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:23,760
Ethi, Rasool's information
is correct.

1261
01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:29,120
Near Renigunda.
It's our jeep alright.

1262
01:46:31,800 --> 01:46:34,360
Qualis.

1263
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:37,080
Front seat empty.
Backseat is empty too.

1264
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:39,280
Back is empty too.

1265
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:44,480
Innova, small boss.

1266
01:46:45,680 --> 01:46:49,920
One minute, boss.
Boss is in the truck.

1267
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:52,240
Sir!

1268
01:46:52,520 --> 01:46:54,880
Shall we open?

1269
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:56,920
Oh my God!

1270
01:46:57,720 --> 01:47:01,280
Sorry, boss, great escape.

1271
01:47:01,480 --> 01:47:04,760
You, silly heart...

1272
01:47:08,240 --> 01:47:10,440
You burnt cotton...

1273
01:47:19,720 --> 01:47:21,920
Ashes doesn't remain
in cotton...

1274
01:47:22,840 --> 01:47:25,480
I told you to go to Coimbatore
with the kids.

1275
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:28,960
Leaving you here alone?
–Only until Kadapa.

1276
01:47:29,240 --> 01:47:31,200
Then I'll manage.

1277
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:34,400
Malik Bhai men
from Hyderabad are on their way.

1278
01:47:35,320 --> 01:47:39,000
I am here with you.
I won't let anything happen to you.

1279
01:47:39,120 --> 01:47:40,520
Don't worry.

1280
01:47:40,640 --> 01:47:43,480
Tell the trust to the heart...

1281
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:45,720
It can hear you...

1282
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:47,920
Where are you...

1283
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:52,880
I'll be there too tomorrow...

1284
01:48:03,440 --> 01:48:07,720
Hey, give him. Don't be shy
just because I'm here.

1285
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:10,840
Eat properly.
–No, we are eating well.

1286
01:48:11,400 --> 01:48:14,120
Don't you like my cooking?
–Come on, sister. 

1287
01:48:14,240 --> 01:48:15,720
Is it that bad?

1288
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:19,440
Or we can ask him to cook.

1289
01:48:19,560 --> 01:48:21,400
It seems he makes
good fish curry.

1290
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:24,400
Someone told me.
–No, this is great.

1291
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:29,400
I'm worried I'll overeat.
We must be alert, we can't sleep.

1292
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:31,800
Careful.
–Abu!

1293
01:48:32,840 --> 01:48:35,600
Keep an eye on things out there.
Don't just think about eating.

1294
01:48:36,640 --> 01:48:40,040
Abu, don't worry.
I've kept some for you.

1295
01:48:40,160 --> 01:48:43,120
It's okay.

1296
01:48:49,480 --> 01:48:52,000
Turn off the light.

1297
01:49:45,800 --> 01:49:47,440
They must have left thinking
we won't take shelter...

1298
01:49:47,560 --> 01:49:49,520
...in a school on a rainy day.

1299
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:52,520
Eat.
–I was in 8th Grade three times.

1300
01:49:52,640 --> 01:49:54,480
I didn't sit for my 9th.
–Turn on the light.

1301
01:49:54,600 --> 01:49:57,000
No!

1302
01:49:57,120 --> 01:49:59,480
Give me the cloth.

1303
01:50:04,320 --> 01:50:08,120
Eat. They have left.

1304
01:50:08,600 --> 01:50:10,040
Get our weapons!

1305
01:50:14,400 --> 01:50:16,560
Come on!

1306
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:28,200
Go! Go!

1307
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:31,160
Hey, stop it!

1308
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:37,120
Hey Varadha, my brother!
If you're inside, come out!

1309
01:50:37,240 --> 01:50:40,080
I want to talk to you.

1310
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:51,480
I'm calling you only to talk.
Look how many are dying...

1311
01:50:51,600 --> 01:50:54,760
...because of you.
–What do you want?

1312
01:50:56,120 --> 01:50:58,440
Varadhan!

1313
01:51:12,760 --> 01:51:16,200
Madurai leaf...

1314
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:24,360
Beautiful fragrance...

1315
01:51:28,200 --> 01:51:31,800
Rose water from Sivagangai...

1316
01:51:33,480 --> 01:51:37,320
When they are combined...

1317
01:51:37,440 --> 01:51:41,440
When they combine...

1318
01:51:43,640 --> 01:51:46,760
One feels shy...

1319
01:51:47,640 --> 01:51:51,200
When the arrow hits...

1320
01:51:51,320 --> 01:51:54,640
A beloved heart...

1321
01:51:54,760 --> 01:51:58,640
The light goes off...

1322
01:52:01,680 --> 01:52:04,560
Heart feels shy...

1323
01:52:04,680 --> 01:52:07,920
When the arrow hits...

1324
01:52:08,040 --> 01:52:10,920
A beloved heart...

1325
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:14,480
The light goes off...

1326
01:52:24,240 --> 01:52:26,600
I thought I died.

1327
01:52:30,920 --> 01:52:32,720
Sorry.

1328
01:52:32,840 --> 01:52:37,840
Why are you apologising?
I insisted on following you.

1329
01:52:39,400 --> 01:52:45,200
I thought I was Kaali
with a weapon in hand,...

1330
01:52:46,640 --> 01:52:50,720
...I thought I could rescue you.

1331
01:52:54,640 --> 01:52:58,240
Leave before your brothers
come here, Varadhan.

1332
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:06,720
Listen to me.
Who will look after the kids?

1333
01:53:06,840 --> 01:53:10,040
No, Chitra.

1334
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:14,960
I don't want to see my husband
get hurt before me.

1335
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:20,440
Listen to me, go on.
–I won't run.

1336
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:22,680
It's a sin I did.

1337
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:28,160
No, your father's sin.

1338
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:35,240
Sin your brothers did.
–What I did is unforgivable.

1339
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:38,520
Do you mean getting
married to me?

1340
01:53:41,600 --> 01:53:44,840
He kept me with him
for 15 years as his henchman.

1341
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:50,600
I was like a useless son.
My brothers had freedom, but I...

1342
01:53:50,720 --> 01:53:53,880
...was serving a life term.

1343
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:57,520
He didn't allow me
to decide on anything.

1344
01:53:57,640 --> 01:54:00,800
I was like a slave all my life.

1345
01:54:00,920 --> 01:54:05,720
After a while,
I lost my patience.

1346
01:54:09,720 --> 01:54:13,880
I called Jayanth and arranged
for those 2 men.

1347
01:54:15,160 --> 01:54:19,800
My father, big boss.....

1348
01:54:26,160 --> 01:54:28,520
At that time,
I felt it was right.

1349
01:54:28,640 --> 01:54:33,240
Then I had blood on my hands.

1350
01:54:33,360 --> 01:54:36,840
I couldn't get it off.

1351
01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:41,560
The sin I did started
haunting me.

1352
01:54:47,080 --> 01:54:49,440
What am I supposed to do?
Tell me.

1353
01:54:49,560 --> 01:54:52,480
Chitra.

1354
01:54:55,120 --> 01:54:58,200
Chitra?

1355
01:55:06,920 --> 01:55:11,720
Don't leave me, Chitra.

1356
01:55:17,160 --> 01:55:20,040
I miss you...

1357
01:55:20,160 --> 01:55:23,760
Please look at me.

1358
01:55:24,440 --> 01:55:28,560
Don't go, Chitra.

1359
01:55:31,080 --> 01:55:34,720
I lost my sleep...

1360
01:55:36,440 --> 01:55:41,080
Without seeing the lady...

1361
01:55:48,280 --> 01:55:50,040
Hello?
–Rasool.

1362
01:55:50,160 --> 01:55:52,400
Yes?
–Help me, dude.

1363
01:55:52,520 --> 01:55:54,840
Where are you?
–In Kadapa.

1364
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:57,360
Which part of Kadapa?
–Bishop Hospital.

1365
01:55:57,480 --> 01:56:00,080
Sir, this is for.....

1366
01:56:00,200 --> 01:56:02,280
What happened?
–No, next to the hospital,...

1367
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:06,160
...at the sub–registrar's office.
–Who is with you?

1368
01:56:09,080 --> 01:56:12,400
Only Chitra and I.
–Okay, don't worry.

1369
01:56:12,520 --> 01:56:14,280
I'll leave now
and be there by morning.

1370
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:16,800
Okay? Be safe.
–Okay.

1371
01:56:19,160 --> 01:56:21,560
Thanks.

1372
01:56:23,600 --> 01:56:27,080
Thanks.

1373
01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:31,400
Hey, sit! Sit!

1374
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:33,280
You're hasty
just like your brother.

1375
01:56:33,400 --> 01:56:35,520
What happened?
–Don't know if he's lying or not.

1376
01:56:35,640 --> 01:56:40,680
It could be a trap for us.
Let's think and decide.

1377
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:43,200
This is not Bishop Hospital.
It is Venkateswara Hospital, sir.

1378
01:56:43,320 --> 01:56:45,680
The sub–registrar's office
is 3 km away from here.

1379
01:56:45,800 --> 01:56:48,920
I know.

1380
01:56:52,680 --> 01:56:56,040
Do you have any old friends?

1381
01:56:57,880 --> 01:57:01,160
Don't trust them.

1382
01:57:25,560 --> 01:57:27,960
Brother!

1383
01:57:29,360 --> 01:57:33,720
Sir!

1384
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:38,800
Your brothers want to see you.
Shall we go, sir?

1385
01:57:39,560 --> 01:57:43,880
Where are Ethi and Thyagu?
–They are on their way, sir.

1386
01:57:46,240 --> 01:57:50,160
Is Rasool there?
–No, where are you?

1387
01:57:54,400 --> 01:57:59,120
How many of you are here?
10 or 15?

1388
01:57:59,240 --> 01:58:00,920
Nothing of that sort.

1389
01:58:01,040 --> 01:58:04,800
Ethi told me to bring you
and Madam Chitra.

1390
01:58:05,440 --> 01:58:10,000
What do you want? My life?
–Nothing of that sort, sir.

1391
01:58:10,120 --> 01:58:12,800
Don't talk that way.

1392
01:58:12,920 --> 01:58:15,240
Life means nothing.

1393
01:58:15,360 --> 01:58:19,400
We can lose it
within a wink of an eye.

1394
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:24,120
It is just a show.

1395
01:58:26,040 --> 01:58:30,720
If you look,
you'll know the meaning.

1396
01:58:32,520 --> 01:58:36,320
A big zero.

1397
01:58:36,720 --> 01:58:42,680
You, me, your grandpa,
grandpa,...

1398
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:46,200
...those who are born,
everyone is a big zero.

1399
01:58:46,320 --> 01:58:50,160
Come one, zero.

1400
01:58:50,280 --> 01:58:52,480
Come!

1401
01:59:05,280 --> 01:59:07,960
Careful!

1402
01:59:10,640 --> 01:59:13,720
Smack him!

1403
01:59:44,680 --> 01:59:47,000
Smack him!

1404
01:59:47,800 --> 01:59:50,520
Smack him!

1405
01:59:50,640 --> 01:59:53,720
No, we must be
grateful to him.

1406
02:00:19,560 --> 02:00:22,600
Boss, you've left me
in a difficult position.

1407
02:00:22,720 --> 02:00:25,480
Move!

1408
02:00:29,800 --> 02:00:34,160
Boss! One minute, let's talk.

1409
02:00:47,040 --> 02:00:50,200
Without knowing our destiny..

1410
02:00:54,240 --> 02:00:57,600
Varadha! What happened?

1411
02:01:04,240 --> 02:01:08,800
Where is Chitra?
Why are you all bloody?

1412
02:01:11,240 --> 02:01:16,800
Varadha, listen to me!
Let's talk!

1413
02:01:16,920 --> 02:01:20,680
Varadha, wait!
Listen to me!

1414
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:23,320
We can talk!
Varadha, wait!

1415
02:01:23,440 --> 02:01:28,680
Listen to me! Okay!

1416
02:01:29,880 --> 02:01:32,080
Are you tensed?
–Betrayer!

1417
02:01:32,200 --> 02:01:35,120
What?
–Take me to my brothers!

1418
02:01:35,360 --> 02:01:36,880
Your brothers offered to pay me
twice the amount you paid.

1419
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:40,320
What am I to do?

1420
02:01:45,480 --> 02:01:47,360
I said we'll come, right?
–Drive, Rasool!

1421
02:01:47,480 --> 02:01:49,400
Drive!
–You wanted to see your brothers.

1422
02:01:49,520 --> 02:01:53,640
That is why I bought you here.
–Drive, Rasool!

1423
02:02:14,720 --> 02:02:16,880
Where is your wife?

1424
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:22,800
Where is your wife?
–Chitra is dead. That's it.

1425
02:02:23,600 --> 02:02:26,360
Rasool, drive without stopping.
Keep going till he says the truth.

1426
02:02:26,480 --> 02:02:28,000
What truth do you want to know?

1427
02:02:28,120 --> 02:02:30,280
I want to know
who tried to kill father.

1428
02:02:30,400 --> 02:02:33,000
Tell us!
–It was me.

1429
02:02:38,640 --> 02:02:41,440
It's Varadhan. Veluthambi gave
a statement before he died.

1430
02:02:41,560 --> 02:02:44,440
Didn't I admit it?
–We have reached the peak.

1431
02:02:44,560 --> 02:02:46,680
Don't stop.
Go in circles.

1432
02:02:46,800 --> 02:02:48,600
Uncle Chezhiyan
made all the arrangements.

1433
02:02:48,720 --> 02:02:51,600
Rs800,000. Rs100,000 advance.
They tried their best...

1434
02:02:51,720 --> 02:02:54,360
...to put the blame
on Chinnappadasan. Right, Varadha?

1435
02:02:54,480 --> 02:02:56,120
You sent someone to kill
your father, then you sent mom...

1436
02:02:56,240 --> 02:02:58,720
...to make peace with me.

1437
02:02:59,960 --> 02:03:01,880
How did we become like this?

1438
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,960
We are brothers.
We are like animals!

1439
02:03:05,400 --> 02:03:07,600
You started it, Varadha.
Bear that in mind.

1440
02:03:07,720 --> 02:03:10,840
What you started
will come back to you.

1441
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:12,520
Fine, what do you want now?

1442
02:03:13,600 --> 02:03:17,320
Money or power?
We'll split the business.

1443
02:03:17,600 --> 02:03:20,080
I'll handle Chennai.
You can take the rest.

1444
02:03:20,200 --> 02:03:21,720
No, it won't work out.
–Buzz off!

1445
02:03:21,840 --> 02:03:27,400
Okay, tell me, how do we split it?
–No!

1446
02:03:27,960 --> 02:03:30,760
What do you want?
–This is for sending Renu to jail!

1447
02:04:06,320 --> 02:04:08,520
This is enough!
–Varadha!

1448
02:04:08,640 --> 02:04:12,080
Varadha!

1449
02:04:12,200 --> 02:04:15,280
Open the door and push him out.
–Nothing doing.

1450
02:04:15,400 --> 02:04:18,040
He is our brother.
We can't push him out.

1451
02:04:18,160 --> 02:04:21,120
Rasool, drive.
Keep driving without stopping.

1452
02:04:28,240 --> 02:04:30,880
I'll stand up then.

1453
02:04:34,920 --> 02:04:37,280
Everything!

1454
02:04:41,720 --> 02:04:44,120
Ethi, we are at the peak!

1455
02:04:44,360 --> 02:04:46,720
There is only one way down
from the peak.

1456
02:04:46,840 --> 02:04:48,480
Ravine.

1457
02:04:50,280 --> 02:04:53,320
When I look down,
I can only see you.

1458
02:04:53,440 --> 02:04:57,280
What problem do I have?
–Only one problem.

1459
02:04:57,720 --> 02:05:03,360
I speak Thai very well.
–What do you mean?

1460
02:05:05,280 --> 02:05:10,920
A man from Thailand killed Chaaya.
I chased and managed to catch him.

1461
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:14,160
And when I questioned him,
he answered me in Thai language.

1462
02:05:14,280 --> 02:05:16,480
What did he say?

1463
02:05:16,600 --> 02:05:21,280
He didn't say anything.
But you're saying everything now.

1464
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:25,480
What rubbish are you saying?

1465
02:05:27,560 --> 02:05:29,600
You asked Varadhan
about your wife.

1466
02:05:29,720 --> 02:05:33,040
Did you ask him
why he killed Chaaya?

1467
02:05:33,440 --> 02:05:36,920
Hey, I.....

1468
02:05:39,280 --> 02:05:43,000
How will you ask?
Because you sent the man.

1469
02:05:43,120 --> 02:05:45,120
I didn't send anyone.

1470
02:05:45,240 --> 02:05:49,600
Don't pretend!

1471
02:05:49,720 --> 02:05:51,800
Look here.

1472
02:05:52,960 --> 02:05:54,960
If you throw
a gun which has no bullets,...

1473
02:05:55,080 --> 02:05:59,160
...does that make you an angel?
You are still pretending.

1474
02:05:59,800 --> 02:06:05,040
It was a mistake.
I didn't ask him to shoot anyone.

1475
02:06:05,160 --> 02:06:07,080
I only asked him
to start a spark.

1476
02:06:07,200 --> 02:06:11,040
You make us fight.
We'll kill each other,...

1477
02:06:11,160 --> 02:06:14,520
...you'll clap in joy!
Must I watch and keep quiet?

1478
02:06:17,640 --> 02:06:20,840
Don't sit, I'll shoot!

1479
02:06:23,440 --> 02:06:28,240
I made a mistake.
I didn't expect loss of life.

1480
02:06:28,360 --> 02:06:32,120
It's my bad.
You know I'm not a ruffian.

1481
02:06:32,240 --> 02:06:35,720
You know that.
If we join hands.....

1482
02:06:35,840 --> 02:06:38,400
No need to join hands!
There shall only be one king!

1483
02:07:38,680 --> 02:07:40,640
You have 2 choices.

1484
02:07:40,760 --> 02:07:42,760
One, you can die like them.

1485
02:07:42,880 --> 02:07:46,480
I'll decide how many
bullets you shall take.

1486
02:07:48,440 --> 02:07:51,440
Or you can join me.

1487
02:07:51,560 --> 02:07:56,560
It can be left or right,
you'll earn well. You decide.

1488
02:08:03,280 --> 02:08:06,600
Ethi! 2 minutes.

1489
02:08:09,720 --> 02:08:15,000
I was 7 at that time.
My mother took me to the airport.

1490
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,400
We went because my father
was coming back from Dubai.

1491
02:08:20,120 --> 02:08:22,280
I stood on a pole and started
looking out for my father.

1492
02:08:22,720 --> 02:08:26,320
My father was tall and strong.

1493
02:08:26,440 --> 02:08:30,080
He was surrounded by the police.

1494
02:08:30,200 --> 02:08:32,200
Suddenly someone fired a shot.

1495
02:08:32,320 --> 02:08:34,320
People started running everywhere.

1496
02:08:34,800 --> 02:08:37,400
My father was missing.

1497
02:08:37,520 --> 02:08:40,120
My mother started running too.

1498
02:08:40,240 --> 02:08:43,080
The car park was all bloody.

1499
02:08:43,200 --> 02:08:46,040
The ambulance left very quickly.

1500
02:08:47,400 --> 02:08:50,200
We went to every hospital.

1501
02:08:50,320 --> 02:08:52,720
Then finally,
one hospital said,...

1502
02:08:52,840 --> 02:08:55,640
..."A gangster who was
shot was brought here,...

1503
02:08:55,760 --> 02:08:59,320
...he died
as soon as he arrived."

1504
02:09:01,960 --> 02:09:06,040
They took my mother in
to identify him.

1505
02:09:07,240 --> 02:09:11,720
Only then I knew
my father was a gangster.

1506
02:09:13,480 --> 02:09:15,800
He wasn't like you guys.
Small scale,...

1507
02:09:15,920 --> 02:09:19,160
...he was a small–time gangster.

1508
02:09:22,920 --> 02:09:26,560
My mother didn't let me
see my father.

1509
02:09:26,680 --> 02:09:28,320
She was afraid I'd become
a gangster like my father too,...

1510
02:09:28,440 --> 02:09:32,120
...she gave me away to my aunt.
I begged her.

1511
02:09:32,240 --> 02:09:34,360
I told her not to give me up
as I won't become like my father.

1512
02:09:34,480 --> 02:09:37,120
I begged her.

1513
02:09:37,240 --> 02:09:39,920
My mother
didn't pay heed to me at all.

1514
02:09:45,200 --> 02:09:48,560
She put me on the train,
she killed herself.

1515
02:09:51,680 --> 02:09:54,360
Since then, I hated gangsters.

1516
02:09:54,600 --> 02:10:00,120
Gangsters, criminals, terrorists,
I hated them.

1517
02:10:00,240 --> 02:10:02,720
That is why
I joined the police force.

1518
02:10:03,080 --> 02:10:06,880
I'm still with the department.
I'm still an inspector.

1519
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:11,120
Inspector Rasool Ebrahim!

1520
02:10:41,320 --> 02:10:45,080
The sound of Earth revolving...

1521
02:10:45,840 --> 02:10:48,880
The sound of ocean...

1522
02:10:49,680 --> 02:10:52,760
The sound of warfare...

1523
02:10:55,200 --> 02:10:58,560
Hello, madam, good morning.
I've done the task given to me.

1524
02:10:58,680 --> 02:11:00,200
Yes, madam.

1525
02:11:01,120 --> 02:11:02,720
I write the report
and leave it on your table...

1526
02:11:02,840 --> 02:11:05,040
...in the morning.

1527
02:11:05,720 --> 02:11:07,480
Everything did not go
as planned.

1528
02:11:07,600 --> 02:11:11,920
Some backfired on me,
I thought I was going to fail.

1529
02:11:12,960 --> 02:11:15,320
Yes, 3 men.

1530
02:11:15,440 --> 02:11:16,920
DCP of Kadapa
is on his way here.

1531
02:11:17,040 --> 02:11:18,560
Yes, madam.

1532
02:11:18,680 --> 02:11:22,040
I'll report to work tomorrow.
Yes, madam. Thank you.

1533
02:11:22,160 --> 02:11:23,880
Good day.

1534
02:11:27,280 --> 02:11:29,640
My heart...

1535
02:11:34,520 --> 02:11:37,720
Will my heart endure it...

1536
02:11:37,840 --> 02:11:41,560
Will my heart endure it...

1537
02:11:41,680 --> 02:11:48,920
Will my heart endure it...

1538
02:11:53,880 --> 02:11:56,920
Will it endure it...

1539
02:11:57,640 --> 02:12:01,000
The sound of Earth revolving...

1540
02:12:01,880 --> 02:12:04,840
The sound of ocean...

1541
02:12:05,680 --> 02:12:08,720
The sound of warfare...

1542
02:12:09,640 --> 02:12:12,120
You won't hear the koel chirp...

1543
02:12:13,640 --> 02:12:15,200
The face of a town...

1544
02:12:15,320 --> 02:12:18,520
...changes 10 years once
like snake shedding its skin.

1545
02:12:22,320 --> 02:12:25,000
Rasool, you can go.

1546
02:12:38,360 --> 02:12:41,560
Dude, can you come to
Red Light Area in Pondicherry?

1547
02:13:03,400 --> 02:13:07,120
Evil enters our mind slowly
like a tortoise...

1548
02:13:08,040 --> 02:13:12,040
It'll kill common sense,
it's addictive...

1549
02:13:12,600 --> 02:13:15,080
All the violence...

1550
02:13:15,200 --> 02:13:17,440
Our strength is...

1551
02:13:17,680 --> 02:13:21,240
Receiving and giving...

1552
02:13:22,680 --> 02:13:24,760
Anger at its peak...

1553
02:13:25,160 --> 02:13:30,920
Gain on betrayal
only if killing is the policy...

1554
02:13:32,720 --> 02:13:37,640
Charging with baton is the sound
of music in social communities...

1555
02:13:37,760 --> 02:13:42,600
Scars in unknown places have
become the identity of people...

1556
02:13:42,720 --> 02:13:47,800
Charging with baton is the sound
of music in social communities...

1557
02:13:50,800 --> 02:13:52,680
We'll do it...

1558
02:13:52,800 --> 02:13:57,160
Hey, the heart has turned red...

1559
02:14:00,200 --> 02:14:02,680
The heart has turned red...

1560
02:14:02,800 --> 02:14:07,480
Hey, the heart has turned red...

1561
02:14:08,120 --> 02:14:10,160
Asked you to change your ways
and make a living...

1562
02:14:10,280 --> 02:14:12,760
You opted for weapons...

1563
02:14:13,120 --> 02:14:14,960
The heart has turned red...

1564
02:14:15,080 --> 02:14:17,640
You did wrong things...

1565
02:14:17,760 --> 02:14:19,680
You did them intentionally...

1566
02:14:20,240 --> 02:14:22,200
The heart has turned red...

1567
02:14:22,720 --> 02:14:27,320
Tell me...

1568
02:14:27,440 --> 02:14:30,160
Is it me...

1569
02:14:30,280 --> 02:14:32,720
Who said and who did it...

1570
02:14:32,840 --> 02:14:35,200
Is it me...

1571
02:14:35,320 --> 02:14:37,760
Both are different people...

1572
02:14:37,880 --> 02:14:39,760
Is it me...

1573
02:14:39,880 --> 02:14:42,880
Who said and who did it...

1574
02:14:43,360 --> 02:14:47,640
Tell me...

1575
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:51,040
Tell me...

1576
02:14:51,300 --> 02:15:20,800
