1
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,482
'This is Mr. Pratap
Singh Nimbalkar.'

2
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,776
'A well-known personality from
the west of Maharashtra.'

3
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:35,320
'His forefathefls goodwill
and his social work,'

4
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:40,290
'Has earned him immense respect
in this locality.'

5
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:44,898
'His wife Ms. Sumitra Devi,
is equally respected by all.'

6
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:48,199
'Today,
they are here to re-instate.. '

7
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:50,741
'..the temple of their family deity.'

8
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:13,229
Stop there..

9
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,791
A childless lady should not
enter the temple premises.

10
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:18,837
The temple's sanctity will be lost.

11
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,371
Mr.Keshav Bhatt!

12
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:27,508
Be within your limits.

13
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:30,738
How can you talk rubbish about
this respectable lady?

14
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,314
Mr. Jai Singh Rao.

15
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,882
My words are controlled by my Lord.

16
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,616
I follow my Lord's rule.

17
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:41,389
And we all have to follow
the rules set by him.

18
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:44,753
You can't compromise on
religious matters.

19
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:46,695
Jaisingh.

20
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:50,627
He has pointed out the
rules of our temple.

21
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:52,995
And I humbly accept his orders.

22
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:29,640
Have it dear.. just a sip, please.

23
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,434
Should I add some more sugar?

24
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,101
Ma'am, just let him go..

25
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,107
Hey Sakhya, go.. get going.

26
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,877
Ma'am..

27
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,346
“Will you please listen to me?

28
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:50,517
This year, please join me on a
foot pilgrimage to Pandharpur.

29
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:53,693
To Pandharpur?

30
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:54,765
What for?

31
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:56,528
To pray to Lord Vitthal.

32
00:05:56,823 --> 00:06:00,669
Tell him to bless you with
a child in your womb.

33
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,633
Do you think I have visited
any less temples?

34
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,873
I did fast,
and several religious activities"

35
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:08,776
"discreetly, I did all of it
against my husband's wish.

36
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:12,814
Even his Doctors couldn't
solve your problem..

37
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:15,915
Of course they helped.

38
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:18,053
At least, we got rightly diagnosed.

39
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:21,783
Nothing is wrong with either of us.

40
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,157
Perhaps, it's my fate to be..

41
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,023
...infertile in this lifetime.

42
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:29,599
Ma'am..

43
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,167
Ma'am.. just once..

44
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:34,633
..come with me on a
foot pilgrimage.

45
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,904
No. Please don't force me.

46
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:39,440
My husband will get angry.

47
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,536
He will not like it.

48
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:44,138
So make him understand
in his own words.

49
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,041
Tell him you are going
for a 'WALK'.

50
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:49,083
I will be with you.

51
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,014
On a walk?

52
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:52,947
Yeah.

00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,772

This is my first foot pilgrimage.

Without thinking about my comfort.

117
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:09,898
I came here all the way, walking.

118
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:11,976
You know my reasons
for coming here.

119
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,508
Despite being married for
so many years now..

120
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:19,246
I couldn't give my family
the happiness of a child.

121
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:25,947
My family suffers immense
pain and insult.

"When people call me 'infertile'.

husband.

But I have been the reason
for his insults.

125
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,095
I can't take it anymore, Vitthala.

126
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:44,238
I can't take it anymore.

127
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,437
Just once.

128
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:49,440
Just once..
let my womb bear a child.

129
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:53,512
Help me prove my womanhood
and motherhood.

130
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:58,021
Free me of this 'infertile' tag.

131
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:01,317
I will donate my first kid to you.

132
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:03,792
I will give away my kid to you.

133
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:08,429
But please bless me
to mother a child.

134
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:12,936
Please" I want to be a mother..

135
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,542
Oh.. I can't believe this.

136
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:26,416
'Morning sickness' after
so many years“.

137
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,987
Ma'am please offer
sugar to our God.

138
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:31,878
You need to take extra care now.

139
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:33,218
You have conceived.

140
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:35,121
Thank you..
-Thank you..

141
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,159
Thank you doctor.

142
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,429
Congratulations!

143
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:41,263
Congratulations!

144
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:42,898
Do you know Sumitra.

145
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:44,496
Today you have..

146
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:49,597
...given me the priceless
gift of my life..

147
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,475
Ma'am.

148
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,908
Your master has forgotten
the bitter past.

149
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,941
He is so jubilant.

150
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,249
Hope you have not forgotten.

151
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:03,580
What?

152
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,186
Your promise to Lord VitthaL.

153
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,923
..of donating your first child.

154
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,130
Hope you still remember..

155
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:16,964
ls our kid an offering?

156
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:19,064
You want to donate our
child to the God?

157
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:21,434
Are you in your senses?

158
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:24,965
God's are not responsible
for childbirth.

159
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,239
Our doctors had told us,
we will take time to conceive.

160
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:31,109
Don't you remember?

161
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:39,156
Having said that, It's my kid too.

162
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:44,458
How could you take such
a unilateral decision?

163
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:50,156
How can you treat our
kid as an offering?

164
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,604
This is ridiculous.

165
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:05,012
'Angry Pratap Singh,
moved to London.. '

166
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,881

for Sumitra Devi.. '

167
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:21,393
'Instead of being happy,
she was always depressed.'

168
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:25,531
'And finally, the day arrived.'

169
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,142
Ma'am..

170
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:41,207
Are you sure?

171
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:52,662
Fine.

172
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:03,573
Hello.

173
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,075
Sir, you have become a father.

174
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:07,643
We are blessed with a baby boy.

175
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,274
Oh is it so?

176
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:10,972
Please don't get upset.

177
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:12,740
I have realized my mistake.

178
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:15,177
I agree Lord Vitthal has blessed
me with a chi
d..

00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:17,948
That doesn't mean I can keep
you away from your kid..

180
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:20,149
..or make my son an orphan.

181
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:23,390
Sir, please come back to me.

182
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,324
I want us to be a happy family.

183
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:31,399
Sumitra..

184
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:35,172
Sumitra..
-Sir!

185
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:36,573
Where is he?

186
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:37,972
He is asleep"

187
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:39,405
Sir..

188
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:53,723
Sumitra, you have given
me such a royal child.

189
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:58,562
His dad Mr. Pratap Singh..
alias Veer Shri.

190
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,392
After Veer Shri,
a name that touches all hearts..

191
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:03,258
..is Abhay..

192
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:06,129
This little boy will be
known as Abhay Singh.

193
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:09,072
Sir, your word is final.

194
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,002
Now we need to find a pet
name for this royal kid.

195
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,069
And let's call him 'Prince'.

196
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:17,344
He will be the talk of the town.

197
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:20,409
He will look..

198
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,815
..and live like a 'Prince'.

199
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,539
"It's a brand new tune.
Ta ra ra ra ra.. "

200
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:48,111
"I don't need the old tune.
Ta ra ra ra ra.. "

201
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:50,542
"Those 7 music notes.
Ta ra ra ra ra.. "

202
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:53,207
"Can someone hum it for me once,
please?"

203
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:55,682
"This new melodious tune.
Ta ra ra ra ra.. "

204
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:58,221
"Crazy and sweet tune.
Ta ra ra ra ra.. "

205
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,618
"With an open mind,
Ta ra ra ra ra.. "

206
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:03,122
"Can someone please come
close to my heart?"

207
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,252
"Damn it.. "

208
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:08,821
"I took so much care and
safeguarded my heart."

209
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:14,203
"Kept myself single all along."

210
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:18,408
"Don't know which beautiful
heart will“ "

211
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:21,637
Connect with my lovely heart."

212
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,183
"Some are charming nymphs" "

213
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:30,581
"Some are hotty nymphs" "

214
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:33,622
"Those girls are hot and sour."

215
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:35,659
"Aye o“ ..

216
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:38,384
"Who is the pretty babe
to be my wife?"

217
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:40,725
"Willing to hit me straight."

218
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,366
"A rustic stunning chic."

219
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:46,260
"I am tired searching for my love.
Ta ra ra ra ra.. "

220
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:48,737
"Bored to death. Ta ra ra ra ra.. "

221
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:51,308
"I am crazy for her..
Ta ra ra ra ra.. "

222
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:53,775
"So bored,
in this life, all alone."

223
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:24,303
"Can I just sweep you away?"

224
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:29,273
"I need to know if you are
from Mumbai or Pune?"

225
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:34,175
"Give me your cell number
or your e-mail id."

226
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:38,952
"I will send you my birthdate
and horoscope."

227
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:40,622
"Come to me oh, dear.. "

228
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:42,784
"I am oh, so eager."

229
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:45,362
"Don't go away from me oh, dear."

230
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:47,431
"Come let's get to
know each other."

231
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:52,735
"Tell me.. Will you accept me?"

232
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,495
"Will you be mine?"

233
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:59,337
"Will you marry me please?"

234
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,702
"Aye oh.. "

235
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,245
"Some are hot urban babes."

236
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:06,644
"Some are slick retro girls."

237
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:09,649
"And I wanted something more."

238
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:11,779
"Aye oh.. "

239
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,414
"Who is the pretty babe
to be my wife,"

240
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:16,789
"Willing to hit me straight."

241
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:20,193
"A rustic stunning chic."

242
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:46,285
Bless me mom.
-May you live long..

243
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:54,426
You may have grown so tall..

244
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,358
..in height and status.

245
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:59,363
..but you will always
be my little Prince.

246
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,629
I may have travelled across
the seven seas..

247
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,537
..and stayed away from
our village"

248
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,042
But I always yearn
for your embrace.

249
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:16,486
May I know your name dear?

250
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:18,680
Yeah..
this is our little 'Rakhumai'..

251
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:21,287
It's Rukmini..

252
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,415
Oh yeah.. Rukmini.

253
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:29,895
I loved it.

254
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:32,765
This tiny Rukmini's tiny
traditional act.

255
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:33,970
Kaveri..
-Yes.

256
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:35,437
He must be very tired..

257
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:36,939
Kindly set the dining table.
-Okay.

258
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:39,635
I have prepared his favorite
dish today. -Mother..

259
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:40,676
Where is dad?

260
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,779
Today, is his 'Audience' day..

261
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:45,372
Perhaps, he forgot about your
home coming. -That's okay..

262
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,576
I will quickly meet
him and others"

263
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:49,380
What about your food?
-Later..

264
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:52,054
Deva..

265
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:54,683
Here take this money..

266
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:57,626
..and get your daughter
wed in great pomp.

267
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:01,824
Hey Narmada..

268
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:03,499
Why are you sulking?

269
00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:06,661
Or are you worried about your
newly born kids's wedding?

270
00:22:08,394 --> 00:22:09,532
Brother..

271
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:12,100
My daughter's wedding is way
too far in the future..

272
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:13,842
Now, my marriage is on the rocks.

273
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:14,968
Why so?

274
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:17,403
My husband says you have
delivered a baby girl.

275
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:20,474
So I want to divorce you.
I don't want either of you.

276
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:21,740
I said..

277
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:23,682
God has blessed us
with a girl child.

278
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:26,480
He says, then offer her
to God as a sacrifice.

279
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:28,115
Did he say that?

280
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:29,988
Make him understand"

281
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:32,460
...people pray to God for kids.

282
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:34,531
Nobody sacrifices their
kids to God.

283
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,701
He is God.. -He is not a devil
to take away your kid.

284
00:22:37,757 --> 00:22:39,737
And tell him to find out what..

285
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:42,635
"couples who fail to conceive,
go through. -Look at us..

286
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,368
"We waited for so long..

287
00:22:44,597 --> 00:22:47,544
"Finally were blessed with Prince.
-Sir, Prince is here..

288
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,578
Yeah that's what..

289
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,669
I mean.. Prince is here..

290
00:22:57,443 --> 00:22:58,478
Prince..

291
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:02,924
May you always be successfu
..

292
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:23,807
Brother Sangram..

293
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:26,614
Cut their thumbs off
and bury them..

294
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:28,816
Brother Sangram,
I got a call from our village"

295
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:30,453
Brother Prince is in town..

296
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,621
Brother?

297
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:46,765
I mean, Prince has come for good.

298
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:05,145
Just day before,
we met Mr. Pratap Singh.

299
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,147
So, what did he say?

300
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:10,723
He said, the farmers from whom
you acquire the land..

301
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:12,088
..in addition to money..

302
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:14,028
“Also give them some
sort of partnership.

303
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,729
He is thinking of some co-operative
type of arrangement.

304
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:20,063
He also urges us to build
homes for these farmers.

305
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,201
My brother thinks like great
leaders, such as"

306
00:24:23,262 --> 00:24:25,572
Vinoba Bhave, Mahatma Gandhi etc.

307
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:27,075
He is little extravagant.

308
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:30,640
But you don't have to worry.
I will manage him.

309
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:33,516
In that case,
this project is a done deal.

310
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:35,778
If you manage to keep
him out of the loop..

311
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:39,048
..then nothing like it. -I will
get the partnership deed and..

312
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:41,682
..cheque during our next meeting.
-Sure, no problem.

313
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:42,959
Thank you..

314
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:44,924
Thank you very much.

315
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:01,706
We have successfully acquired
5 lots of land.

316
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:06,109
Prince is back in town.

317
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:11,147
Soon, I have to organize the
father-son duo's funeral.

318
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:20,692
Keep your doors open..

319
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,693
I will be sending 2
more members soon"

320
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:30,768
Pratap Singh Nimbalkar and
Abhay Singh Nimba
kar..

321
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:33,937
The drinks are ready on the field..

322
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:36,570
...waiting for the players
to join in.

323
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:40,306
Hey"

324
00:25:41,607 --> 00:25:44,087
What nonsense is this?
-Look.. I have been asked to take..

325
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:46,817
..care of your food and drinks"
-I can't handle food.

326
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:48,653
And I can't handle drinks.

327
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:49,916
You can't?

328
00:25:50,783 --> 00:25:51,818
Can't you have some?

329
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:54,189
You lived abroad,
and how can you not drink..

330
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:56,599
You think everyone abroad boozes?

331
00:25:56,822 --> 00:25:58,096
Foreign countries are so cold.

332
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:01,761
I thought everyone out there
must be drinking a lot.

333
00:26:01,827 --> 00:26:04,171
Okay.. tell me something" -You
never visited any foreign country..

334
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,640
Still you drink.. why so?

335
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:07,276
Where do I drink?

336
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:09,939
At the max, I have one or two.

337
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:12,048
And I get knocked on the third.

338
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:15,346
Do you realize the trouble
I had to go through..

339
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:16,678
...while setting it all up?

340
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:20,246
I was skeptical about the right
procedure to serve drinks.

341
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:21,653
Okay.. go ahead, have it.

342
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,086
Please have it.

343
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:25,288
No.. it's okay..

344
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:28,195
lam offering"

345
00:26:28,287 --> 00:26:29,288
I insist.

346
00:26:29,355 --> 00:26:30,595
Why do you trouble?

347
00:26:30,656 --> 00:26:31,794
Please have..

348
00:26:32,024 --> 00:26:33,970
Okay.. I respect your words"
so I will have it.

349
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:46,749
It's an extremely bad vice.

350
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,781
But as they say“
'All for the best.'

351
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:51,888
I need to check if this
too is 'for the best'..

352
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:53,055
I understand"

353
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:56,985
Our dinner is ready.
It's my wife at the door.

354
00:26:57,216 --> 00:26:58,286
How do you know?

355
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:01,858
Her thunderous knock explains.

356
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:04,728
<i>HEW Why do you".</i>

357
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:44,374
I lived abroad so"

358
00:27:44,463 --> 00:27:46,841
..he thought I must be a boozard.

359
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:58,247
Good morning.. Rakhumai..

360
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:01,948

Okay.. I am sorry" Rukmini..
-Are you happy now?

362
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,924
Unc

where were you all these years?

363
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:09,260
I was abroad.
I was learning there..

364
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:13,425
We have schools here as well..
so why did you go abroad?

365
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:16,773
They have better schools there.
For higher studies.

366
00:28:16,962 --> 00:28:18,839
They are bigger schools.

367
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:24,071
Do I have to go abroad too, leaving
my parents all alone? -No dear..

368
00:28:24,136 --> 00:28:25,410
Now that I am back..

369
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:30,083
I will build a great school,
for you and your friends"

370
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:32,222
..and they will be bigger
than the schools abroad.

371
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:34,188
And I will build beautiful
houses too.

372
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,349
Really?

373
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:36,987
Promise"

374
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:40,863
Unc
e..

375
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:43,399
You please build houses
like these for all.

376
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:45,492
There should be such cupboards.

377
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:48,963
...several utensils, and food too.

378
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:50,296
Food? Wow..

379
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:52,170
You mentioned food,
And I am hungry now.

380
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:53,767
So what have you cooked today?

381
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:59,372
I have cooked some rice,
curry, Indian bread..

382
00:29:00,172 --> 00:29:01,173
And vegetable.

383
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:02,877
I've cooked, Ladyfinger..

384
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,076
That's my favorite.

385
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:05,517
Great.. come on serve it fast.

386
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:07,347
How is that possible?

387
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,748
We haven't offered it to our God,
as yet.

388
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:11,292
Why do you want to offer it to God?

389
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,327
Of course.

390
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:16,857
First we offer it to our God..
and then..

391
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:19,060
Then we eat..

392
00:29:19,191 --> 00:29:22,934
Vitthoba first, then the rest.

393
00:29:23,395 --> 00:29:24,533
What is this mom?

394
00:29:24,797 --> 00:29:27,209
Why do you want to make
her an old school?

395
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:31,074
Okay.. -You have your food now and
when are you off to Nashik?

396
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:33,548
Oh yeah.. Atu
's wedding.

397
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:41,556
Hey Nikhil.. -Sorry dude,
lam a little late. -Hi!

398
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,351
How was the wedding?
-And where is our newly wed couple?

399
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:47,963
What couple are you talking about?
-It's all a mess. -What mess?

400
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,226
They are on the verge of
calling off the wedding.

401
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:50,824
What happened exactly?

402
00:29:50,923 --> 00:29:52,925
Yesterday the bride
told Atul that..

403
00:29:53,025 --> 00:29:55,835
..after marriage, she doesn't want
to stay in a joint family.

404
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:59,237
There was a huge argument.
And it all ended in a mess.

405
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:01,272
How silly".

406
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:05,540
Now that I am here..
I will set them all straight.

407
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:41,376
lam glad you are here.

408
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,147
Just take these stuff downstairs.

409
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:44,551
Rest I will take care of.

410
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:45,587
You understood?

411
00:30:45,644 --> 00:30:48,022
Hello.. what is all this?

412
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,955
You have already packed
up all your stuff?

413
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:52,061
ls it all so simple?

414
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:53,395
What?

415
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:55,157
You are Mr.Ni
esh, right?

416
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,095
To hell with Nilesh or Paresh.

417
00:30:57,289 --> 00:30:59,235
ls wedding a trivial affair to you?

418
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:01,631
Why would you not stay
with your in-laws?

419
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:05,041
We are what we are,
because of our parents.

420
00:31:05,264 --> 00:31:06,902
But l..
-What?

421
00:31:07,933 --> 00:31:09,207
Why are you tight-lipped now?

422
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:12,144
You wanted to marry Atul,
didn't you?

423
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,409
Or did anyone force him on you?

424
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:17,011
You don't want a Joint family,
right?

425
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:19,280
They are so eager to
welcome you home.

426
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:22,086
And you want them out of their own
home, isn't it? -But when did l...?

427
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,922
-Then who else is responsible
for this mess?

428
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:40,136
Speak up now..

429
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,910
Mr. Shiner..

430
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:46,912
I have already sorted the issue.

431
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:50,448
Everything is under control.

432
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:51,954
Yeah..

433
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,990
And I have realized my mistake.

434
00:31:54,446 --> 00:31:56,323
lam ready for the wedding.

435
00:31:56,615 --> 00:31:57,593
Thanks.

436
00:31:57,649 --> 00:31:59,424
Excuse me, let me get ready.

437
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:07,530
Err.. I am sorry"

438
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,537
I didn't know you..

439
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:12,302
Err.. I thought you were her..

440
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:15,371
lam sorry for the confusion.
-Out. -But..

441
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:18,243
lam glad it happened.
-Since you still unmarried.

442
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:20,044
lam sure you won't
behave like her..

443
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:21,116
Will you?

444
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:42,092
What are your views on marriages?

445
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:45,324
I mean, their wedding..

446
00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:47,167
What's your name?

447
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:49,465
I wish you had mentioned your name.

448
00:33:49,628 --> 00:33:52,370
It would've been easier to print
our invitation cards.

449
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:09,490
I've been observing you,
why are you smiling so much?

450
00:34:10,115 --> 00:34:11,355
What smile?

451
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:12,751
Yes.. smile.

452
00:34:12,851 --> 00:34:14,387
A stupid smile.

453
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:16,496
As if you thinking
about something.

454
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:18,358
Thinking about what?

455
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:21,435
Okay.. so what's her name?

456
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,535
Damn it.. I don't know that.

457
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,167
Oh! Mom, you are too sharp.

458
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:28,068
You know to read my mind.

459
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,041
lam your mother.

460
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:34,339
No. You are the world's best mom.

461
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,275
One has to be very fortunate"

462
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:38,445
..to get a mother like you.

463
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:40,478
Hey, there you go..

464
00:34:40,712 --> 00:34:42,123
lam praising you..

465
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,352
..and you are shedding tears
hearing your praises.

466
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:51,498
May Lord Vitthal fulfill
all your wishes.

467
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,827
Not just love..

468
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:57,302
May he shower upon you,
all the happiness in the world..

469
00:34:57,863 --> 00:35:00,173
..and may nobody get
envious of you.

470
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,117
Hello..

471
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:44,346
Sangram, you are a dead man.

472
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:47,184
Sakha.. what's the matter?

473
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:49,254
Sangram, has created a havoc.

474
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:51,425
It's time to teach him
a lesson or two.

475
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:53,423
Just because we don't interfere..

476
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:55,461
"doesn't mean he can
do what he wants.

477
00:35:55,554 --> 00:35:56,828
lam not going to spare him.

478
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:59,198
Sakha, will you please explain?

479
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:03,567
Your dad allotted lands
to our village farmers.

480
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:05,503
They will be signing
the agreements too.

481
00:36:05,697 --> 00:36:07,870
Sangram is forcefully trying
to acquire their lands"

482
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:10,742
..at dirt rates by torturing
and killing them.

483
00:36:10,969 --> 00:36:14,507
He wants to sell the lands to a
corporate for his own benefit.

484
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:16,344
Today,
I will show him my true colors"

485
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:19,945
Sakha.. this way, you will just
add more fuel to the fire.

486
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:23,287
Be calm, now that I am back..

487
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,351
...let me handle it.

488
00:36:33,425 --> 00:36:34,403
Brother Sangram..

489
00:36:34,459 --> 00:36:36,439
..why are you hitting
these poor people?

490
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:39,369
What's their mistake?
-Will you please let me know?

491
00:36:39,431 --> 00:36:40,409
You?

492
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,539
I don't care to inform my father.

493
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,704
Who the hell are you?

494
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:46,710
And I suggest,
you don't interfere in my affairs.

495
00:36:46,972 --> 00:36:48,747
Else you will be..

496
00:36:53,278 --> 00:36:54,848
..charred to death.

497
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,516
Hey, how dare you?

498
00:36:56,615 --> 00:36:59,721
Sakha.. let me talk to him.

499
00:37:01,453 --> 00:37:02,488
You stay calm.

500
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:05,267
Brother Sangram..

501
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:08,768
Let our elders take care of land
disputes, agreements etc.

502
00:37:09,828 --> 00:37:11,637
We are too young to get into it.

503
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:15,534
Also, we are far too inexperienced
for all such matters.

504
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:16,845
Jai Singh..

505
00:37:16,935 --> 00:37:21,247
Do you think I don't get to
know about your activities?

506
00:37:22,374 --> 00:37:23,876
What's your problem?

507
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:25,988
You have achieved nothing in life.

508
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:28,585
And you are encouraging Sangram
to walk your path..

509
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:31,927
After our dad's death,
I did everything for you.

510
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:34,429
I financed your businesses.
-Supported your hobbies.

511
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,798
I spent money on you,
and I wasted our wealth on you.

512
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,630
I cleared your debts.

513
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,029
I sorted your fights.

514
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:43,868
I helped you build your home.

515
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,032
I gave you money to
run your household.

516
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,742
lam still supporting
your household.

517
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:48,876
Still, you don't want to
live a clean life..

518
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:53,545
Commissioner has been ignoring
your nefarious activities..

519
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:55,709
..just because he respects me.

520
00:37:55,807 --> 00:37:57,912
And I feel ashamed of this.

521
00:37:58,009 --> 00:37:59,852
Do you realize?

522
00:38:00,412 --> 00:38:01,982
And what's this new
land related issue?

523
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,883
What rights are you
trying to claim?

524
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:07,489
I have given you enough.

525
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:08,924
Get one thing straight.

526
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,460
..the land belongs to the
hardworking farmers.

527
00:38:13,558 --> 00:38:15,970
Don't interfere in their business.

528
00:38:16,428 --> 00:38:18,931
Brother, you are getting me wrong.

529
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,538
In fact, I was trying to safeguard
our land for Prince.

530
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:23,772
You don't have to worry about him.

531
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:28,441
I have made all necessary
arrangements for him.

532
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,481
You don't worry.

533
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:34,613
If you are not used to 'good
behavior, then forget it.

534
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:36,517
Tomorrow first thing..

535
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:39,357
I will get the land transferred
in the names of the farmers.

536
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:42,388
So there is no further confusion.

537
00:38:44,589 --> 00:38:46,796
Yeah Mr. Co

ector..
-As per your instructions.

538
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:48,098
I have organized everything.

539
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:49,667
Let me get my boss' approvals.

540
00:38:49,761 --> 00:38:52,037
..and I will then fix up
a meeting with you.

541
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:53,731
Sir..

542
00:38:54,566 --> 00:38:55,670
Sir..

543
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:38,110
The 'Father's Chapter' is over.

544
00:39:39,811 --> 00:39:42,883
If the son attempts to
create any trouble.

545
00:39:43,448 --> 00:39:45,951
I will not hesitate to
send him to his dad.

546
00:39:46,418 --> 00:39:48,455
What troubles can this
simpleton create?

547
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:53,567
He is too naive to understand
our legal technicalities.

548
00:39:55,627 --> 00:39:57,072
Sir, he is Mr. Parnis..

549
00:39:57,429 --> 00:39:59,909
Mr.Pratap had promised to build
homes for the poor..

550
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,543
..he heads that department.

551
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,901
Meet Mr. Deshmukh..

552
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:05,538
..he handles our Sugar factory
along with Mr. Desai.

553
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:06,809
Mr. Desai is on leave today.

554
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:08,817
Mr. Deshmukh will provide you with
all required information.

555
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:09,851
Mr. Naik..

556
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:12,681
He handles our Dairy industry.

557
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:13,981
That's Mr. Sarnobat..

558
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:16,715
He heads our construction business.

559
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:18,986
Mr. Shinde, just a minute please.

560
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:20,495
Excuse me.

561
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,928
Shinde, who are these guys?

562
00:40:24,022 --> 00:40:26,593
Sir, they are the staffs of
our various businesses..

563
00:40:26,691 --> 00:40:28,136
I know that..

564
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,599
...if I start communicating
with all of them..

565
00:40:30,695 --> 00:40:33,141
I will take minimum 5 years to
understand our businesses.

566
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:36,635
Can someone give me
a complete lowdown?

567
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:38,109
There is just one such person.

568
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:39,477
Nandini Ma'am.

569
00:40:39,571 --> 00:40:41,676
Okay, then send her to my cabin.

570
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,047
Sir, hold on.

571
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:51,625
Here, this is her resignation.

572
00:40:52,517 --> 00:40:53,723
May I know the reason?

573
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:55,122
Sir, I have no idea.

574
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,927
But she stopped coming
to work after"

575
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:58,466
..submitting her resignation.

576
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:24,857
You?

577
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:26,826
Please don't bombard
me with your words"

578
00:41:26,918 --> 00:41:29,023
..today, please hear me out.

579
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:32,758
Don't stand at the doorstep"

580
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:34,232
Please come on in.

581
00:41:38,763 --> 00:41:41,767
I thought you will summon
me to your office.

582
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:45,277
I didn't expect you here.

583
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:49,743
Since last one year..

584
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:52,117
...I was serving your dad as
his 'Personal Assistant'.

585
00:41:53,645 --> 00:41:55,625
I was up-to-date with
all activities.

586
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:56,987
...of the 'Nimbalkar Group'.

587
00:41:57,615 --> 00:42:00,528
Since, I had to update my
boss on all developments.

588
00:42:01,653 --> 00:42:03,599
Besides this official work..

589
00:42:03,755 --> 00:42:07,862
I took care of his medicines
and food timings.

590
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:11,073
He was like a child.

591
00:42:11,296 --> 00:42:14,175
I had to force him to have
his food and pills.

592
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:17,542
I prepared a schedule
for his insulin..

593
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:19,512
..and blood pressure pills.

594
00:42:19,804 --> 00:42:22,683
He was quite unwell in
the last few days.

595
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:25,151
I was very worried.

596
00:42:25,243 --> 00:42:30,056
And when I went on leave for
just a couple of days..

597
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:33,194
"his entire routine
had gone haywire.

598
00:42:33,685 --> 00:42:37,064
lam sure he must've ignored
his food and medicines"

599
00:42:37,255 --> 00:42:39,735
...resulting in this great loss.

600
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:47,570
Had I been around,
I could've saved him.

601
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,580
This guilt..

602
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:54,810
“Will I be bogged by this
guilt all my life?

603
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:06,190
Since I couldn't handle
my responsibility.

604
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:08,230
I decided to quit.

605
00:43:10,188 --> 00:43:12,099
That's all I have to say.

606
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:16,899
I respect your emotions.

607
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:21,937
I feel you are unnecessarily
blaming yourself.

608
00:43:23,134 --> 00:43:24,169
I know..

609
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:26,009
I lost my dad.

610
00:43:26,838 --> 00:43:28,681
He was unwell.

611
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,678
I agree with you..

612
00:43:32,143 --> 00:43:36,956
..he was very irresponsible about
his food and medicines.

613
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,721
But,
there is something called destiny.

614
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,991
He was ruled by his destiny"

615
00:43:45,256 --> 00:43:47,896
"similarly we will be ruled
by our own destinies.

616
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:50,639
I suggest,
you stop blaming yourself.

617
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:53,635
I am not accepting
your resignation.

618
00:43:55,867 --> 00:43:58,939
More than my dad..

619
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:00,876
"myself and the Nimbalkar group..

620
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:02,645
..need your support at this moment.

621
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:07,680
So, join immediately.

622
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,062
Good!

623
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:17,295
We have loads to do.

624
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:20,669
And I will ease your job..

625
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,402
"as I don't need insulin
or blood pressure pills.

626
00:44:54,392 --> 00:45:00,809
"I have lost my heart to someone."

627
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:08,207
"Oh!
I have lost my heart to someone."

628
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:10,146
"May I know why?"

629
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:12,912
"Can someone tell me.. "

630
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:18,288
"Why everything around me,
seems so beautiful?"

631
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:28,202
"Oh!
The time is ticking so slowly,"

632
00:45:32,797 --> 00:45:36,836
"Oh!
The time is ticking so slowly,"

633
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:41,747
"Moments with you make
me go crazy,"

634
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:46,377
"Everything around me
seems so beautiful."

635
00:46:10,468 --> 00:46:11,811
Sir, what's the matter?

636
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:18,216
During the wedding, when we met..

637
00:46:18,409 --> 00:46:22,858
..you knew who I was, didn't you?

638
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:26,394
Still you behaved so indifferent..

639
00:46:27,184 --> 00:46:29,755
You were the talk of the town.

640
00:46:30,188 --> 00:46:31,758
So recognizing you was very simple.

641
00:46:31,823 --> 00:46:32,801
Besides that..

642
00:46:32,924 --> 00:46:33,925
What?

643
00:46:34,425 --> 00:46:37,133
You were chasing me like
any regular guy.

644
00:46:37,395 --> 00:46:43,038
I liked it. You were so simple,
just like your dad.

645
00:46:43,834 --> 00:46:46,576
I felt like confessing
everything to you.

646
00:46:47,505 --> 00:46:54,423
But I realized,
I am just an employee.

647
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:58,820
I can't cross my limits"

648
00:47:00,518 --> 00:47:01,496
That explains.

649
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:05,500
"My heartbeat now has
a crazy rhythm."

650
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:08,029
"Your simple touch,
speak a 1000 words" "

651
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:10,935
"And your silence speak volumes."

652
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:15,300
"My heartbeat now has
a crazy rhythm."

653
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:18,175
"Your simple touch,
speak a 1000 words" "

654
00:47:18,269 --> 00:47:20,112
"And your silence speak volumes."

655
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:22,480
"Hope every emotion transforms
into words"

656
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:24,884
"And become a musical
for me to sing."

657
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:27,147
"Let me just get lost
in this moment."

658
00:47:27,245 --> 00:47:28,451
"Come to me oh dear.. "

659
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:35,463
"Oh!
The time is ticking so slowly,"

660
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:44,035
"Oh!
The time is ticking so slowly,"

661
00:47:44,462 --> 00:47:46,100
"May I know why?"

662
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:48,867
"Can someone tell me.. "

663
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:54,878
"Why everything around me,
seems so beautiful?"

664
00:48:28,139 --> 00:48:31,916
"I want you to know my true
feelings for you."

665
00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:34,680
"My eyes speak my heart out."

666
00:48:34,979 --> 00:48:36,981
"How do I control myself?"

667
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:39,322
"I want to get drenched
with you in this love."

668
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:41,693
"I want you to know my true
feelings for you“ "

669
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:44,159
"I want to embrace you oh dear,"

670
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:45,393
"Come to me please."

671
00:48:47,325 --> 00:48:52,001
"My heart blossomed, just for you."

672
00:48:55,666 --> 00:49:00,979
"Oh!
The time is ticking so slowly,"

673
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:05,516
"Moments with you make
me go crazy,"

674
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:11,082
"Why everything around,
seems so beautiful."

675
00:49:25,997 --> 00:49:28,238
Sakha, may I advise you something?

676
00:49:28,332 --> 00:49:29,436
I know it.

677
00:49:29,567 --> 00:49:31,171
You want me to quit drinking.

678
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:33,612
Yeah.. so why don't you quit?

679
00:49:34,005 --> 00:49:36,212
I do it temporarily.

680
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:39,717
I quit 24 hours before
blood donation.

681
00:49:41,746 --> 00:49:44,955
So what kind of donation,
will make you quit booze, for good?

682
00:49:46,417 --> 00:49:48,124
No donations required..

683
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,590
..just one shock is good enough.

684
00:49:51,355 --> 00:49:54,199
One strong blow in life
should be sufficient.

685
00:49:54,291 --> 00:49:56,032
..for me to quit this habit.

686
00:49:58,262 --> 00:50:01,732
I hope you get the shock of your
life, and you quit this vice.

687
00:50:04,735 --> 00:50:06,578
Sakha..
-Yeah, tell me.

688
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:17,252
Assume an industrialist,
with a female colleague.

689
00:50:17,415 --> 00:50:22,660
Such a cheap man should
be beaten blue.

690
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:25,427
Hear me out please.

691
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:27,594
Oh, you have more to say, is it
-Yes.

692
00:50:28,259 --> 00:50:30,261
Okay, go ahead.

693
00:50:33,297 --> 00:50:36,176
Okay.. how about a king..

694
00:50:37,101 --> 00:50:38,774
..who starts liking one
of his ministers..

695
00:50:38,836 --> 00:50:43,581
Oh, is it a period story?
The story will take long time..

696
00:50:43,641 --> 00:50:45,678
Okay, let me be direct.

697
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:50,483
My friend is in love
with his secretary.

698
00:50:51,749 --> 00:50:54,195
He is thinking of proposing to her.

699
00:50:56,087 --> 00:51:01,196
ls it right for a boss to
marry his secretary?

700
00:51:02,593 --> 00:51:04,504
Will it impact his business?

701
00:51:04,762 --> 00:51:08,801
Will his marriage be successful?

702
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:10,841
I don't know about your friend.

703
00:51:12,303 --> 00:51:14,783
But I suggest,
you pour your heart out to Nandini.

704
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:16,343
And propose to her.

705
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,442
Just go ahead and marry her.

706
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:27,688
ls it so?

707
00:51:31,789 --> 00:51:33,632
You simplified it for me..

708
00:51:38,195 --> 00:51:40,072
I will propose to her immediately.

709
00:52:16,434 --> 00:52:17,811
Brother..

710
00:52:19,437 --> 00:52:20,711
What's going on?

711
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:22,646
Prince dear..

712
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,710
Last night,
Sangram visited our colony.

713
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:28,186
Come on..
pick your stuff and get going.

714
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:31,623
Mr.Pratap Singh had
pampered you a lot.

715
00:52:31,816 --> 00:52:34,387
Now that he is gone.
It's time for you all to go.

716
00:52:34,685 --> 00:52:36,494
Brother Sangram,
please don't say such things.

717
00:52:36,754 --> 00:52:38,324
Where do we go?

718
00:52:38,522 --> 00:52:39,830
Go where he is..

719
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:41,500
..to the cemetery for all I care.

720
00:52:42,226 --> 00:52:44,570
But, Prince told us that..

721
00:52:44,762 --> 00:52:47,538
..we have equal rights
in this land.

722
00:52:52,436 --> 00:52:56,179
Hey, is your Prince's word final?

723
00:52:58,809 --> 00:53:00,618
Here.. see this" how your
dear Prince has"

724
00:53:01,578 --> 00:53:04,218
..crapped all over this document.

725
00:53:05,382 --> 00:53:06,622
He has signed"

726
00:53:06,784 --> 00:53:08,957
..and transfered the
entire plot to us.

727
00:53:10,454 --> 00:53:14,300
He has fooled you all
for his own benefit.

728
00:53:14,959 --> 00:53:15,937
Look at this"

729
00:53:15,993 --> 00:53:17,370
That's not true.

730
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:20,473
I haven't signed any agreements.

731
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:21,904
There is something amiss.

732
00:53:22,233 --> 00:53:25,703
Now I will set everything straight.

733
00:53:27,604 --> 00:53:29,641
Set everything on fire.

734
00:53:58,769 --> 00:53:59,804
Welcome“.

735
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:04,007
So have you come to see
our burnt bodies?

736
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:06,812
Enough of your big talks.

737
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:10,722
..and false promises of giving
us our lands and houses.

738
00:54:10,781 --> 00:54:12,260
What did we get for
trusting in you?

739
00:54:12,316 --> 00:54:14,592
This is what we got.
notices to vacate our lands.

740
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:16,963
Sangram was here..

741
00:54:17,054 --> 00:54:19,398
He told us that you have transfered
all rights to him.

742
00:54:19,556 --> 00:54:20,933
Just for your own benefits.

743
00:54:21,325 --> 00:54:22,668
You selfish guy.

744
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:24,538
Granny.

745
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:26,503
I belong to Mr. Pratap
Singh's bloodline.

746
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:28,842
Cheating is not my nature.

747
00:54:29,066 --> 00:54:31,376
My uncle and Sangram are
responsible for this mess.

748
00:54:32,903 --> 00:54:34,610
Trust me..

749
00:54:35,005 --> 00:54:37,542
Trust my dad's words.

750
00:54:38,042 --> 00:54:40,249
I will investigate this matter..

751
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:41,718
..and in less than 24 hours"

752
00:54:41,812 --> 00:54:43,416
I will restore your legal rights.

753
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:45,818
If I fail to deliver,
I will never use my family name.

754
00:54:51,889 --> 00:54:53,300
What's all this?

755
00:54:53,591 --> 00:54:55,002
Property papers"

756
00:54:55,392 --> 00:54:57,565
Why can't you read?

757
00:54:57,728 --> 00:54:59,833
I can, and that's why
lam questioning you.

758
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:03,978
You can fool the uneducated,
poor farmers"

759
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:05,571
..but not me.

760
00:55:05,669 --> 00:55:08,616
It was well decided to allot
the lands to them.

761
00:55:08,772 --> 00:55:10,513
Then how did these
documents crop up?

762
00:55:10,607 --> 00:55:12,712
Uncle, I am warning you..
Don't test my patience.

763
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:17,359
Keep your voice decibels low.
lam warning you.

764
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:21,325
I don't have any patience.

765
00:55:22,753 --> 00:55:24,664
Don't you recognize your signature?

766
00:55:25,356 --> 00:55:27,097
No it's not my signature.

767
00:55:27,524 --> 00:55:28,901
These are forged documents.

768
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:30,070
Oh is it?

769
00:55:30,527 --> 00:55:31,972
Then why don't you prove it.

770
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:34,737
First prove the forgery..
and then talk.

771
00:55:34,865 --> 00:55:36,538
Of course. I will prove it..

772
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,576
..and I will make sure you
both end up in prison.

773
00:55:41,939 --> 00:55:43,885
I will submit these documents
to the Co

ector..

774
00:55:43,974 --> 00:55:46,352
Let him do the needful.

775
00:59:43,947 --> 00:59:46,985
So you wanted to punish us,
didn't you?

776
00:59:47,618 --> 00:59:50,360
Now call your family
to pick your body.

777
01:00:15,345 --> 01:00:16,949
lam sorry ma'am..

778
01:00:17,114 --> 01:00:20,357
It's a complicated case.

779
01:00:21,118 --> 01:00:23,291
There are multiple fractures.

780
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:25,731
"also there are several
injuries in his head..

781
01:00:26,023 --> 01:00:29,027
..which has caused severe
internal bleeding.

782
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:31,635
We need to transfer this case to..

783
01:00:31,728 --> 01:00:33,298
..a neurosurgeon at the earliest.

784
01:00:33,864 --> 01:00:37,676
And unfortunately.. there aren't
any neurosurgeons available.

785
01:00:38,035 --> 01:00:40,276
All top rated surgeons
are attending"

786
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:42,043
..a conference in Singapore.

787
01:00:42,205 --> 01:00:45,778
I suggest we must take
him to Singapore.

788
01:00:47,344 --> 01:00:49,415
You please initiate
the formalities.

789
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:52,688
Sakha, you wait here..

790
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:57,329
I will organize the funds and
other required documents.

791
01:00:57,421 --> 01:00:58,923
Okay.

792
01:01:23,113 --> 01:01:24,649
Aunt Sumitra Devi..

793
01:01:25,382 --> 01:01:27,055
Why you stealing so much?

794
01:01:27,217 --> 01:01:28,821
And all in one go..

795
01:01:29,753 --> 01:01:31,699
Sangram..

796
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:34,691
..what nonsense are you talking?

797
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:36,395
Hope you are in your senses?

798
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:41,468
Dear Aunt, its time for you
to be in your senses.

799
01:01:42,866 --> 01:01:47,110
Shinde, please announce the
breaking news to my dear aunt.

800
01:01:50,474 --> 01:01:56,117
Ma'am, you have lost all rights
over your properties.

801
01:01:57,881 --> 01:02:01,829
The rights have been transfered
to Mr.Jai Singh and Mr.

802
01:02:01,918 --> 01:02:02,896
Sangram Singh.

803
01:02:04,354 --> 01:02:07,995
Prince has signed all the
necessary documents.

804
01:02:09,326 --> 01:02:11,033
Shinde,
what nonsense are you talking?

805
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:13,233
Do you realize?

806
01:02:13,897 --> 01:02:15,376
Why will Prince do
such a stupid act.

807
01:02:15,432 --> 01:02:17,070
I got it done, ma'am..

808
01:02:40,824 --> 01:02:42,997
I have heard of people
going blind in love..

809
01:02:43,226 --> 01:02:45,763
And your son helped
me experience it.

810
01:02:46,163 --> 01:02:48,200
While signing the documents.

811
01:02:48,498 --> 01:02:51,445
..your dear Prince used
to just ogle at me.

812
01:03:02,379 --> 01:03:03,790
You bitch.

813
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:06,187
How could you take such undue
advantage of his love.

814
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:08,054
Where will you wash away your sins?

815
01:03:08,118 --> 01:03:10,428
You can keep a tab on all
good and bad deeds.

816
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:13,198
That's all you will be left with.

817
01:03:13,423 --> 01:03:15,994
Hey,
throw everyone out of this place.

818
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:18,038
Rukmini..

819
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:19,773
Stop it.

820
01:03:19,996 --> 01:03:21,532
Leave her I say.

821
01:03:23,266 --> 01:03:25,212
Sangram, what's going on here?

822
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:27,949
Okay..
you keep everything for yourself.

823
01:03:28,205 --> 01:03:32,176
Let me take some money at least
for Prince's treatment.

824
01:03:32,409 --> 01:03:35,390
I don't know if it will
suffice his medication.

825
01:03:35,578 --> 01:03:37,216
Perhaps, his cremation..
-Sangram..

826
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,486
Don't scream you old hag.

827
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:40,552
Don't scream.

828
01:03:41,852 --> 01:03:44,389
You can beg and plead..

829
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:47,163
I know it won't suit you.

830
01:03:47,624 --> 01:03:49,467
Do some work.

831
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:57,175
Why don't you massage
Kaveri's feet?

832
01:03:58,602 --> 01:04:01,139
I will surely pay you the labour.

833
01:04:10,647 --> 01:04:12,217
No.

834
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:15,625
Ma'am please don't.

835
01:04:17,287 --> 01:04:21,429
I beg for my son.

836
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:24,270
No ma'am..
-Please don't stop me.

837
01:04:25,562 --> 01:04:29,408
My kid is battling for his life.

838
01:04:39,909 --> 01:04:41,547
Hey oldie..

839
01:04:55,658 --> 01:04:58,502
I don't want you to work for free.

840
01:05:15,111 --> 01:05:17,955
Dear aunt.. I forgot to tell you..

841
01:05:18,181 --> 01:05:21,025
Myself and Nandini,
together we retired your husband"

842
01:05:22,185 --> 01:05:24,529
And today Prince is struggling
so hard..

843
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:26,662
We take the credit
for that as well.

844
01:05:27,524 --> 01:05:31,267
So tell me now,
for whom do you want to live?

845
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:03,194
Lord Vitthal blessed
me with motherhood.

846
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:06,336
lam sure he will safeguard
my son too.

847
01:06:32,188 --> 01:06:33,599
Ma'am..

848
01:06:34,057 --> 01:06:35,764
Prince is no more.

849
01:07:41,291 --> 01:07:42,463
Sakha..

850
01:07:44,427 --> 01:07:47,203
Take me to Pandharpur..

851
01:07:59,342 --> 01:08:01,344
What are you punishing me for?

852
01:08:01,811 --> 01:08:04,155
Am I being punished for this
life or my past lives?

853
01:08:04,314 --> 01:08:05,657
You blessed me with everything"

854
01:08:05,715 --> 01:08:07,285
..and took it all away in no time.

855
01:08:07,350 --> 01:08:09,455
Vitthala,
I fail to understand your game.

856
01:08:09,786 --> 01:08:12,528
You took the form of a gardner to
help the saint, Savata Mali.

857
01:08:12,722 --> 01:08:15,225
You did everything for everyone.

858
01:08:15,492 --> 01:08:18,063
You waited at Saint Punda
ik's
doorsteps.

859
01:08:18,328 --> 01:08:19,363
Then..

860
01:08:19,696 --> 01:08:22,643
Why are you torturing me?

861
01:08:23,533 --> 01:08:25,410
Enough now..

862
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:27,645
..get over with your
arms akimbo pose"

863
01:08:27,871 --> 01:08:29,782
You gave me a son and took
him away from me.

864
01:08:29,872 --> 01:08:31,818
I want him back..

865
01:08:32,275 --> 01:08:35,085
Oh Vittha
a.. I want my son back.

866
01:08:35,779 --> 01:08:38,385
Else I will take a holy dip in
your Chandrabhaga river..

867
01:08:38,515 --> 01:08:41,587
..and will forget you..

868
01:08:41,885 --> 01:08:43,660
..and your Pandharpur forever.

869
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:49,392
What's going on there?

870
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:51,868
Let me check.

871
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:02,172
You are acting too smart, is it?

872
01:09:02,739 --> 01:09:04,309
Get up.

873
01:09:56,826 --> 01:09:58,703
And now its my turn..

874
01:10:02,966 --> 01:10:04,502
No bloody fights.

875
01:10:04,834 --> 01:10:06,507
Bloody, no fun.

876
01:11:41,097 --> 01:11:47,912
"Chants in the praise
of Lord Vitthal"

877
01:11:48,004 --> 01:11:54,785
"Chants in the praise
of Lord Vitthal"

878
01:11:54,877 --> 01:12:01,487
"Chants in the praise
of Lord Vitthal"

879
01:12:01,751 --> 01:12:07,463
"Chants in the praise
of Lord Vitthal"

880
01:12:07,523 --> 01:12:10,629
"Oh Mauli, our divine mother God."

881
01:12:10,727 --> 01:12:14,004
"Oh Mauli, our divine mother God."

882
01:12:14,097 --> 01:12:17,510
"Oh Mauli, our divine mother God."

883
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:20,877
"Oh Mauli, our divine mother God."

884
01:12:20,970 --> 01:12:24,383
"Oh Mauli, our divine mother God."

885
01:12:24,474 --> 01:12:29,355
"Oh Mauli, our divine mother God."

886
01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:36,758
This temple is my home.

887
01:12:36,986 --> 01:12:39,125
And these perverts have been
misbehaving in my home..

888
01:12:39,489 --> 01:12:42,333
They deserve to get bashed.

889
01:12:43,693 --> 01:12:46,674
My name is Mauli.

890
01:12:47,063 --> 01:12:49,805
Lord Vitthal is my mom and my dad.

891
01:12:51,634 --> 01:12:53,341
My punch is amazing..

892
01:12:53,569 --> 01:12:55,344
My kick is smashing"

893
01:12:55,538 --> 01:12:56,516
Bloody hell..

894
01:12:56,572 --> 01:12:58,449
"everything about me is
simply outstanding.

895
01:13:29,539 --> 01:13:33,112
Kavita,

Hey you can't go without
Getting coloured.

01:13:35,511 --> 01:13:37,013
Now we will colour you.

898
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:39,050
Hey hold on.. you rascals.

Today you should get Red with
colours, and not with anger.

Be it Gokul or Pandharpur..

907
01:14:01,004 --> 01:14:03,006
Only Krishna gets the first
chance to colour his girl.

930
01:16:08,664 --> 01:16:12,874

931
01:16:13,035 --> 01:16:16,744
"Trying to hit on me every season."

01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:33,225
"In this intoxicated state.. "

937
01:16:33,322 --> 01:16:35,063

"Your looks drive me crazy."

944
01:17:45,361 --> 01:17:49,002
"How can I let go of
this opportunity?"

945
01:17:49,098 --> 01:17:53,444
"Come,

"I know to keep everyone
in my control."

949
01:18:11,153 --> 01:18:12,962
"You kill me always,"

950
01:18:13,055 --> 01:18:14,796

"I am high on this colour of love..

"And in this amazing
festival of Ho

961
01:18:54,263 --> 01:18:58,939
"Let's all just dance.. "

962
01:19:00,870 --> 01:19:02,508
"It's all so super awesome."

963
01:19:23,926 --> 01:19:26,065
This damn intoxication is the
reason for your love..

964
01:19:26,328 --> 01:19:28,365
I thought you will come
over to my p
ace..

965
01:19:28,464 --> 01:19:30,444
..and talk to my mom
about our marriage.

966
01:19:30,866 --> 01:19:32,209
Marriage?

967
01:19:32,869 --> 01:19:34,143
With you?

968
01:19:35,905 --> 01:19:42,345
You and I together..

969
01:19:42,812 --> 01:19:47,852
..and we live happily ever after"

970
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:49,793
Forget it..

971
01:19:49,885 --> 01:19:52,456
I will be glad if you are with me,
till we reach home.

972
01:19:53,155 --> 01:19:54,759
Stop..

973
01:19:55,191 --> 01:19:59,264
From here on,
my father will guide me..

974
01:19:59,462 --> 01:20:00,497
You carry on..

975
01:20:01,096 --> 01:20:02,074
Good night.

976
01:20:02,398 --> 01:20:03,809
Are you sure?

977
01:20:04,133 --> 01:20:05,476
Of course"

978
01:20:06,102 --> 01:20:10,312
lam used to this route.

979
01:20:11,006 --> 01:20:12,212
You please go..

980
01:20:21,050 --> 01:20:23,257
Oh Vittha
a.. Mau
i..

981
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:27,130
You are my dad.. and my mother.

982
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:32,132
You are my sweet mother,
oh Vittha
a..

983
01:20:32,395 --> 01:20:35,103
I respect you, so when I am drunk..

984
01:20:35,197 --> 01:20:37,438
I don't enter your
temple premises.

985
01:20:38,567 --> 01:20:43,983
To stand on your feet,
in this drunken state.

986
01:20:45,107 --> 01:20:47,246
..is such a challenging task..

987
01:20:47,409 --> 01:20:50,015
You will never understand this,
Vitthoba..

988
01:20:50,346 --> 01:20:53,486
You, with your arms akimbo..

989
01:20:53,849 --> 01:20:56,352
..and looking over your kids..

990
01:20:56,652 --> 01:20:59,258
"Every dad on the earth
has copied your style..

991
01:20:59,622 --> 01:21:02,569
But you,
never changed your style. huh!

992
01:21:03,592 --> 01:21:06,004
It's pretty late now..

993
01:21:06,228 --> 01:21:08,435
Excuse me please"

994
01:21:10,533 --> 01:21:13,241
One minute..

995
01:21:17,173 --> 01:21:21,952
Do you know why I take this
route every night?

996
01:21:22,311 --> 01:21:29,229
Just to check if the brick you
standing upon is intact..

997
01:21:29,552 --> 01:21:31,998
I know how important that
brick is to you..

998
01:21:32,254 --> 01:21:34,393
..and to me..

999
01:21:35,024 --> 01:21:37,937
All your devotees are commoners"

1000
01:21:38,194 --> 01:21:43,041
..just you and I are brick lovers.

1001
01:21:44,466 --> 01:21:48,312
My dear dad Vitthal and
mother Rakhumai..

1002
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:52,643
Good night.

1003
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:19,940
Who are you?

1004
01:22:20,402 --> 01:22:23,508
How did you enter my home?

1005
01:22:24,073 --> 01:22:26,383
My door was shut..

1006
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:29,388
Or were you hiding in my home?

1007
01:22:31,547 --> 01:22:33,618
Hey.. what's going on here?

1008
01:22:34,183 --> 01:22:36,185
How can you barge into my house?

1009
01:22:36,285 --> 01:22:38,424
Hey.. who the hell are you?

1010
01:22:39,421 --> 01:22:41,025
If incase you want bricks.

1011
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:42,963
..come to the kiln after 11 am.

1012
01:22:43,359 --> 01:22:44,963
Don't waste my time now..

1013
01:22:45,261 --> 01:22:47,366
Come on.. get going..

1014
01:22:47,463 --> 01:22:48,601
I need to get ready..

1015
01:22:48,697 --> 01:22:50,301
Mau
i..

1016
01:22:50,466 --> 01:22:51,945
I want to tell you something.

1017
01:22:52,001 --> 01:22:53,207
Hello Ma'am..

1018
01:22:53,302 --> 01:22:54,303
Mau

1019

Pratap Singh Nimba

of the Nimbalkars..

1021
01:22:59,108 --> 01:23:01,247
Nope..

1022
01:23:01,510 --> 01:23:02,648
Come on.. leave now..

1023
01:23:03,011 --> 01:23:04,081
Justa minute..

Please be ca

1025
01:23:09,051 --> 01:23:10,758
Hear me out please"

1026
01:23:11,687 --> 01:23:14,998
I was married to Mr. Pratap
Singh Nimba
kar..

1027
01:23:15,190 --> 01:23:19,536
Even after 9 years of marriage,
I failed to conceive..

1028
01:23:20,095 --> 01:23:22,371
I was blessed with everything
in life..

1029
01:23:22,631 --> 01:23:24,736
..except a child.

1030
01:23:32,508 --> 01:23:35,250
'Ma'am.. just once..'

1031
01:23:35,411 --> 01:23:40,053
'Just this one time accompany
me on a foot pilgrimage.. '

1032
01:23:48,657 --> 01:23:51,137
'Help me prove my womanhood
and motherhood.'

1033
01:23:51,326 --> 01:23:53,806
'Free me of this 'infertile' tag.'

1034
01:23:54,129 --> 01:23:56,302
'I will donate my first
kid to you.'

1035
01:23:56,532 --> 01:23:58,375
'Oh.. I can't believe this.'

1036
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:00,773
'Morning sickness' after
so many years" '

1037
01:24:01,336 --> 01:24:03,407
'Congratulations. '

1038
01:24:03,705 --> 01:24:06,379
'Your promise to lord VitthaL. '

1039
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:09,044
'Of donating your first child.'

1040
01:24:09,244 --> 01:24:10,416
'ls our kid an offering?'

1041
01:24:10,479 --> 01:24:12,322
'What? You want to donate
our child to the God?'

1042
01:24:12,381 --> 01:24:15,260
Mr.Pratap Singh in a fit of
rage moved to London..

1043
01:24:16,518 --> 01:24:20,364
When I visited my doctor,
on the seventh month..

1044
01:24:20,522 --> 01:24:22,399
..'Congratulations..'

1045
01:24:22,725 --> 01:24:28,767
'After 9 long years,
God has blessed you with txmins.'

1046
01:24:34,269 --> 01:24:39,776
'Doctor, this information should
just be between us.'

1047
01:24:42,077 --> 01:24:46,583
'I forced my doctor to take
an oath and keep mum.. '

1048
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:49,255
'Ma'am just a few more minutes.. '

1049
01:24:49,618 --> 01:24:50,790
'Quic
y.'

1050
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:52,592
'Give me'

1051
01:25:08,771 --> 01:25:11,149
'Here take this child
to the other room.'

1052
01:25:11,507 --> 01:25:14,886
'Tell others that I have
delivered a baby boy.'

1053
01:25:19,448 --> 01:25:23,260
'The next day" I left for
Pandharpur with my infant.'

1054
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:12,570
Mauli!

1055
01:26:28,317 --> 01:26:30,729
This sounds like a movie script.

1056
01:26:31,820 --> 01:26:34,699
I started my story as an orphan..

1057
01:26:34,923 --> 01:26:38,166
And by interval,
my parents appear miraculously"

1058
01:26:38,961 --> 01:26:41,202
My parents didn't want me..
so they offered me..

1059
01:26:41,296 --> 01:26:42,570
..to the God..

1060
01:26:42,764 --> 01:26:44,903
They decided on their own..

1061
01:26:46,702 --> 01:26:49,342
At an age when I needed
my parents.

1062
01:26:49,571 --> 01:26:53,519
I was wandering aimlessly
in the temple.

1063
01:26:53,875 --> 01:26:55,582
I thought the priest was my dad..

1064
01:26:55,811 --> 01:26:59,190
But he cleared the air,
saying he is not my father..

1065
01:26:59,548 --> 01:27:01,528
So, who is my father?

1066
01:27:01,850 --> 01:27:03,955
At the age of 10, while I was
troubled by this question"

1067
01:27:04,019 --> 01:27:06,431
The priest went away
on a pilgrimage.

1068
01:27:09,691 --> 01:27:13,434
Devotees come to Vittha
's temple
to meet their mother God.

1069
01:27:13,829 --> 01:27:17,504
And there, I was living with
Vitthal, in his temple..

1070
01:27:17,699 --> 01:27:18,837
...like an orphan.

1071
01:27:19,267 --> 01:27:22,214
Still I saw my parents
in Vitthal-Rakhumai.

1072
01:27:22,938 --> 01:27:24,474
So what if they are stone idols?

1073
01:27:24,706 --> 01:27:26,481
At least they were always
there for me.

1074
01:27:26,709 --> 01:27:28,814
I was the orphan kid raised
by the priest"

1075
01:27:29,011 --> 01:27:31,457
So everyone here took
special care of me.

1076
01:27:31,747 --> 01:27:33,249
I could eat wherever..

1077
01:27:33,448 --> 01:27:35,291
I never had to pay
for my schooling.

1078
01:27:35,651 --> 01:27:37,927
People donated their clothes
and books to me..

1079
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:39,694
I had everything I wanted..

1080
01:27:39,922 --> 01:27:44,803
Yet the thought of being an
orphan troubled me always.

1081
01:27:45,694 --> 01:27:51,372
After my schooling,
I joined a kiln to earn my living.

1082
01:27:52,301 --> 01:27:55,612
Brick was an integral
part of my life.

1083
01:27:56,405 --> 01:28:00,581
The priest had introduced Lord
Vitthal to me, as my dad.

1084
01:28:01,043 --> 01:28:06,288
I wondered why Vitthal
stood on a brick..

1085
01:28:06,815 --> 01:28:08,852
Later, I figured out..

1086
01:28:09,051 --> 01:28:11,930
Vitthals‘ strength
lies in the brick.

1087
01:28:12,387 --> 01:28:15,891
Lord Vitthal blessed
you with two kids.

1088
01:28:16,358 --> 01:28:19,464
You gave shelter to one and
abandoned the other..

1089
01:28:19,828 --> 01:28:23,401
You showered parental love on
one; and tortured the other.

1090
01:28:23,799 --> 01:28:25,472
You gave the world to one..

1091
01:28:25,567 --> 01:28:27,808
...and gave away the other
to the world..

1092
01:28:34,443 --> 01:28:35,979
Nimbalkar ma'am..

1093
01:28:36,345 --> 01:28:39,519
"finally,
today you remembered this son..

1094
01:28:42,984 --> 01:28:46,989
I realize my mistakes.

1095
01:28:48,657 --> 01:28:51,103
I don't know how to make
you understand"

1096
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:55,837
At this hour,
I need you to be with me.

1097
01:28:56,465 --> 01:28:57,443
You need me?

1098
01:28:57,499 --> 01:28:58,477
May I know why?

1099
01:28:58,633 --> 01:29:00,943
ls my brother of no
use to you, now?

1100
01:29:01,637 --> 01:29:05,608
Or has he wasted your family
wealth on his vices?

1101
01:29:07,576 --> 01:29:09,749
He is no more..

1102
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:16,691
You have to come with me to
restore our family respect.

1103
01:29:17,019 --> 01:29:18,965
You are Mr.Pratap Singh's
bloodline..

1104
01:29:19,388 --> 01:29:20,526
Yeah.. Mau
i..

1105
01:29:21,923 --> 01:29:23,732
Ma'am is right.

1106
01:29:23,992 --> 01:29:26,404
You have to fill in your
brother's shoes.

1107
01:29:27,162 --> 01:29:29,733
Hey.. what do you mean?

1108
01:29:30,132 --> 01:29:32,635
You think I am a bloody laborer?

1109
01:29:33,368 --> 01:29:36,645
To dance at your whims
and fancies.

1110
01:29:37,406 --> 01:29:39,579
This lady, a mother.. -She has
been playing such dirty games.

1111
01:29:39,641 --> 01:29:41,678
And you are supporting her acts.

1112
01:29:42,044 --> 01:29:43,853
Had your mother discarded you..

1113
01:29:43,945 --> 01:29:47,085
"Would you have still
supported her?

1114
01:29:47,949 --> 01:29:49,758
You may be rich and famous"

1115
01:29:49,818 --> 01:29:51,593
..but today, you are equal
to the street beggars.

1116
01:29:51,653 --> 01:29:53,826
Come on.. leave now. But today,
you are just a tramp..

1117
01:30:16,011 --> 01:30:18,582
Don't try to trap me in your
emotional stories.

1118
01:30:18,981 --> 01:30:21,484
Vitthal-Rakhumai are my parents.

1119
01:30:21,984 --> 01:30:24,191
You can never replace my parents.

1120
01:30:47,643 --> 01:30:48,849
Ma'am..

1121
01:30:49,978 --> 01:30:54,757
We should accept God's
wish and move on..

1122
01:30:56,051 --> 01:30:57,155
Let's go..

1123
01:30:57,552 --> 01:30:58,997
Sakha..

1124
01:31:00,188 --> 01:31:03,829
Ma'am.. forget him.. I don't
think he will join us..

1125
01:31:06,561 --> 01:31:07,631
Let's go..

1126
01:31:09,665 --> 01:31:10,871
Mau
i..

1127
01:31:11,933 --> 01:31:13,173
..you should go with her.

1128
01:31:15,871 --> 01:31:18,943
You have been pining for your
parents all your life.

1129
01:31:19,174 --> 01:31:21,882
Today she is at your doorstep"

1130
01:31:23,512 --> 01:31:24,957
...apologizing for her mistakes.

1131
01:31:25,981 --> 01:31:27,585
She needs you..

1132
01:31:29,584 --> 01:31:32,258
Why don't you go and help her..?

1133
01:31:33,255 --> 01:31:35,599
Please go with her..

1134
01:31:37,793 --> 01:31:40,205
You are her savior"

1135
01:31:40,796 --> 01:31:42,002
I won't go with her..

1136
01:31:43,832 --> 01:31:46,108
That lady,
she is a stranger to me..

1137
01:31:46,902 --> 01:31:49,542
You don't try to change my mind.

1138
01:31:51,173 --> 01:31:52,208
To hell with her.

1139
01:32:12,027 --> 01:32:13,904
Give her some water.
-Sure.

1140
01:32:16,031 --> 01:32:17,032
Please have.

1141
01:32:21,803 --> 01:32:24,545
Sakha..

1142
01:32:24,873 --> 01:32:27,513
Hey, what's the matter?

1143
01:32:27,676 --> 01:32:28,711
Sakha..

1144
01:32:29,044 --> 01:32:30,182
Hey, what's the matter?

1145
01:32:30,312 --> 01:32:32,121
Sangram is here..

1146
01:33:43,685 --> 01:33:47,223
How many more times
will you kill him?

1147
01:33:49,357 --> 01:33:51,997
I beg of you“.

1148
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:55,898
Your uncle was a noble man..

1149
01:33:56,398 --> 01:33:59,072
At least now, please stop insulting
the dead person.

1150
01:34:04,439 --> 01:34:07,750
Fantastic and humble speech"

1151
01:34:08,877 --> 01:34:15,351
Once in my uncles' presence,
your charged on me.. didn't you?

1152
01:34:17,152 --> 01:34:19,063
Get out of my way now..

1153
01:34:21,389 --> 01:34:22,629
Aunt dear..

1154
01:34:34,769 --> 01:34:38,876
ls it an old-age hobby
to collect statues?

1155
01:34:40,275 --> 01:34:42,755
The other day you took away
Lord Vittha
's statue"

1156
01:34:42,811 --> 01:34:45,052
Today, you are giving away your
life for this man's statue"

1157
01:34:45,213 --> 01:34:47,750
Why are you wasting your time?

1158
01:34:48,917 --> 01:34:51,659
There is no one left to
erect your statue"

1159
01:34:52,454 --> 01:34:53,865
Hey.. bring it on..

1160
01:35:20,415 --> 01:35:27,094
.."Oh Mauli,
our divine mother God."

1161
01:35:27,255 --> 01:35:34,036
"Oh Mauli, our divine mother God."

1162
01:35:34,129 --> 01:35:37,440
"Vitthal chants"

1163
01:35:37,532 --> 01:35:40,945
"Vitthal chants"

1164
01:35:41,036 --> 01:35:44,313
"Vitthal chants"

1165
01:35:44,406 --> 01:35:47,819
"Vitthal chants"

1166
01:35:47,909 --> 01:35:51,220
"Vitthal chants"

1167
01:35:51,313 --> 01:35:54,760
"Vitthal chants"

1168
01:35:54,849 --> 01:35:58,058
"Vitthal chants"

1169
01:35:58,153 --> 01:36:01,396
"Vitthal chants"

1170
01:36:01,556 --> 01:36:04,969
"Vitthal chants"

1171
01:36:05,026 --> 01:36:08,269
"Vitthal chants"

1172
01:36:08,363 --> 01:36:12,072
"Vitthal chants"

1173
01:36:15,069 --> 01:36:16,104
Prince?

1174
01:36:18,473 --> 01:36:19,918
Mau
i..

1175
01:36:20,508 --> 01:36:22,044
Prince is my brother..

1176
01:36:52,874 --> 01:36:55,445
I have totaled up all
your activities.

1177
01:36:56,077 --> 01:36:58,580
I will settle your account soon.

1178
01:37:00,582 --> 01:37:03,426
Etch my face very clearly
in your head, Sangram.

1179
01:37:04,018 --> 01:37:07,363
This is not Prince's face..
I am Mau
i..

1180
01:37:08,156 --> 01:37:11,035
I promise you,
this face will haunt you..

1181
01:37:11,493 --> 01:37:13,336
If not, I will never call
myself Mauli again..

1182
01:37:24,439 --> 01:37:27,181
I gave away my first son
to lord VitthaL.

1183
01:37:27,542 --> 01:37:29,920
He has returned me my son.

1184
01:37:30,979 --> 01:37:33,357
My son is still alive..

1185
01:37:40,521 --> 01:37:44,025
How can she produce such a grown
up boy, in mere 10 days?

1186
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:47,572
And that too, a replica of Prince?
-Forget it..

1187
01:37:47,629 --> 01:37:51,941
..we have all original documents
with Prince's signature.

1188
01:37:52,867 --> 01:37:56,007
Now no Mauli can make
any difference.

1189
01:37:56,471 --> 01:37:58,246
Sangram, don't take it so lightly.

1190
01:37:58,473 --> 01:38:05,083
This new Prince can very well
instigate the poor villagers.

1191
01:38:10,085 --> 01:38:13,123
After so many years of separation.

1192
01:38:14,189 --> 01:38:16,465
He agreed to help his mom..

1193
01:38:17,892 --> 01:38:18,996
So?

1194
01:38:19,327 --> 01:38:20,567
We need to find out.

1195
01:38:21,362 --> 01:38:25,242
We should find out more
about their relation.

1196
01:38:31,706 --> 01:38:32,980
Mau
i..

1197
01:38:43,218 --> 01:38:45,494
You abandoned me long back.

1198
01:38:45,987 --> 01:38:48,228
Now don't try to come closer.

1199
01:38:49,390 --> 01:38:52,963
Lord Vitthal is my everything.

1200
01:38:54,729 --> 01:38:56,470
I came here on my Lord's command.

1201
01:38:57,232 --> 01:38:58,404
lam not here for you..

1202
01:39:00,535 --> 01:39:04,210
Yes..
Sumitra ma'am delivered twins.

1203
01:39:04,539 --> 01:39:07,452
Twin baby boys..

1204
01:39:07,976 --> 01:39:12,925
She made me promise,
to keep it all confidential.

1205
01:39:24,192 --> 01:39:25,500
What?
-You tell me..

1206
01:39:26,427 --> 01:39:28,634
What?
-What's the progress on the school?

1207
01:39:29,063 --> 01:39:31,009
Which school?
-My school..

1208
01:39:31,132 --> 01:39:32,475
What happened to your school?

1209
01:39:32,534 --> 01:39:35,606
You were to build a school,
bigger than all foreign schools.

1210
01:39:36,037 --> 01:39:37,038
Foreign schools?

1211
01:39:37,305 --> 01:39:38,613
Justa minute..

1212
01:39:39,474 --> 01:39:42,148
Hey.. what are you up to?

1213
01:39:42,410 --> 01:39:44,321
You are my uncle right?

1214
01:39:47,048 --> 01:39:49,153
Yes.
-So, what's my name?

1215
01:39:49,517 --> 01:39:51,087
Your name..

1216
01:39:51,485 --> 01:39:52,725
Name..

1217
01:39:53,788 --> 01:39:55,734
Save me O' Rakhumai..

1218
01:39:56,057 --> 01:39:58,298
lam not Rakhumai.. I am Rukmini..

1219
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:00,767
Oh yeah.. Rukmini..

1220
01:40:01,730 --> 01:40:04,176
Oh Vitthala..
I failed to visit you.

1221
01:40:04,232 --> 01:40:05,609
And you sent my mom to me.

1222
01:40:05,700 --> 01:40:07,680
So what happens to our promise?

1223
01:40:08,036 --> 01:40:09,606
Promise"

1224
01:40:11,339 --> 01:40:14,218
Hey.. you please go inside.

1225
01:40:14,476 --> 01:40:15,454
Okay.. here I go..

1226
01:40:15,510 --> 01:40:17,683
But I won't forget what
you promised"

1227
01:40:18,045 --> 01:40:20,218
Okay.. don't trouble your uncle.

1228
01:40:22,383 --> 01:40:23,987
What promise is she talking about?

1229
01:40:24,051 --> 01:40:26,361
To build schools for the kids..

1230
01:40:26,654 --> 01:40:28,292
"homes for the villagers.

1231
01:40:28,656 --> 01:40:31,068
..to beautify the village
and develop it further.

1232
01:40:31,526 --> 01:40:33,369
Prince wanted to do all of these"

1233
01:40:35,196 --> 01:40:38,268
But, Sangram and Jai Singh
were against his dreams.

1234
01:41:19,774 --> 01:41:22,186
Now I get a clear picture..

1235
01:41:24,612 --> 01:41:27,092
We should just wipe them off.

1236
01:41:30,184 --> 01:41:34,564
After seeing Sangram,
I figured out his dad's character.

1237
01:41:36,524 --> 01:41:42,497
I will take just 1O minutes
to finish them off.

1238
01:41:43,131 --> 01:41:44,371
By doing that..

1239
01:41:44,665 --> 01:41:46,076
..we will end up in prison"

1240
01:41:46,267 --> 01:41:48,543
..our mom and the villagers
will be homeless again.

1241
01:41:48,603 --> 01:41:51,209
They will end-up spending the rest
of their lives in this filth.

1242
01:41:51,473 --> 01:41:52,508
Mau
i..

1243
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:55,548
We should smartly avenge
our Prince's murder..

1244
01:41:55,910 --> 01:41:58,857
Sangram, Jai Singh and Nandini,
they all should be punished.

1245
01:41:59,113 --> 01:42:02,287
We should claim our rights.
And restore our family's respect.

1246
01:42:04,118 --> 01:42:05,791
What are their businesses?

1247
01:42:06,354 --> 01:42:09,164
What do these dogs do to
keep themselves busy?

1248
01:42:09,424 --> 01:42:11,734
Land agreement is still
under process.

1249
01:42:12,226 --> 01:42:14,536
They have a dance bar, close by.

1250
01:42:15,496 --> 01:42:16,804
Dance bar!

1251
01:42:24,605 --> 01:42:27,142
Hello! -Mauli has set the
bar on fire. -What?

1252
01:42:27,208 --> 01:42:28,312
Please come quickly.

1253
01:42:28,543 --> 01:42:29,817
Damn this Mau
i..

1254
01:42:30,611 --> 01:42:31,749
Hey“ let's leave..

1255
01:42:41,155 --> 01:42:42,566
You had the keys on you?

1256
01:42:42,657 --> 01:42:45,137
I brought a pin along,
for no reason.

1257
01:42:45,193 --> 01:42:47,639
Mauli,
I have grown up in this house.

1258
01:42:48,763 --> 01:42:51,835
Did you ever flick some
cash from here?

1259
01:42:53,467 --> 01:42:55,310
Err.. Okay..

1260
01:42:55,436 --> 01:42:56,642
You check the papers.

1261
01:42:59,273 --> 01:43:01,753
These are the farmer's land
related documents.

1262
01:43:02,243 --> 01:43:05,224
I can't find the property documents
signed by our Prince..

1263
01:43:05,313 --> 01:43:06,849
Okay“
Just take whatever is available“.

1264
01:43:06,914 --> 01:43:08,791
"let's move..

1265
01:43:15,523 --> 01:43:17,901
There is no fire..
so why did he call?

1266
01:43:18,659 --> 01:43:21,196
You wait here..
I will be back soon..

1267
01:43:22,530 --> 01:43:23,770
Brother..
-Rasca
.

1268
01:43:24,332 --> 01:43:25,811
Are you drunk?

1269
01:43:26,367 --> 01:43:28,369
Why did you play a prank on me?
-Me..

1270
01:43:28,903 --> 01:43:30,974
You said the bar is on fire..
Where is it?

1271
01:43:31,372 --> 01:43:32,350
Where is it?

1272
01:43:33,307 --> 01:43:36,311
Now you just wait and watch.

1273
01:43:36,644 --> 01:43:38,317
I swear,
I didn't play any prank on you.

1274
01:43:38,412 --> 01:43:40,483
I know who did it..

1275
01:43:40,982 --> 01:43:42,393
Idiot.

1276
01:43:43,318 --> 01:43:44,626
What's the matter?

1277
01:44:10,278 --> 01:44:11,655
ls this their additional business?

1278
01:44:11,779 --> 01:44:14,385
They earn a lot from this place.

1279
01:44:16,517 --> 01:44:18,224
Hey, do you have a lighter?
-Yes sir.

1280
01:44:18,419 --> 01:44:19,420
Yes.
-Pass it on.

1281
01:45:18,479 --> 01:45:20,083
Brother..
Mauli has set our bar on fire.

1282
01:45:20,315 --> 01:45:21,658
Bloody! Hang up!

1283
01:45:21,749 --> 01:45:24,662
Bar.. -Hang up now.. -I swear,
come right away.

1284
01:45:24,718 --> 01:45:27,028
Tomorrow, I will set you straight.
-I will char you to death..

1285
01:45:27,655 --> 01:45:28,861
Bloody hang up the phone.

1286
01:45:30,458 --> 01:45:33,769
Why do they drink so much
if they can't handle it?

1287
01:45:36,430 --> 01:45:38,103
I tried calling brother Sangram..

1288
01:45:38,365 --> 01:45:39,708
He was in no mood to hear me out.

1289
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:42,440
Later he stopped taking my calls.
-And then switched off his phone.

1290
01:45:42,503 --> 01:45:44,380
By that time our Bar was
completely charred.

1291
01:45:46,040 --> 01:45:47,815
Are you narrating a story here?

1292
01:45:48,042 --> 01:45:49,453
No that..

1293
01:45:56,384 --> 01:45:59,729
Wherever he is,
go get him right away.

1294
01:46:00,087 --> 01:46:02,397
It's time for some lessons.

1295
01:46:02,823 --> 01:46:05,963
He will never be able to light
even a match stick, ever.

1296
01:46:06,594 --> 01:46:08,574
It's okay..
No need for all of this.

1297
01:46:08,930 --> 01:46:10,409
Hey.. where is Mauli?

1298
01:46:10,732 --> 01:46:12,507
Has anyone seen Mauli around?

1299
01:46:14,969 --> 01:46:16,971
Dad, are you looking for Mauli?

1300
01:46:17,071 --> 01:46:18,948
Yeah
-He is having tea at our house.

1301
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:20,018
What?

1302
01:46:32,620 --> 01:46:34,793
I heard you were looking for me..

1303
01:46:35,022 --> 01:46:36,501
So I came over to meet you.

1304
01:46:36,758 --> 01:46:38,601
Sister-in-
aw..
you've made some amazing tea.

1305
01:46:38,659 --> 01:46:41,139
Your wife makes such awesome tea.
-You bloody".

1306
01:48:11,618 --> 01:48:13,723
Go tell your boss Sangram..

1307
01:48:14,121 --> 01:48:16,931
lam not a gentleman like Prince.

1308
01:48:17,291 --> 01:48:21,000
lam not destined to get killed
by these stray dogs.

1309
01:48:21,161 --> 01:48:22,868
I have a long way to go.

1310
01:48:34,108 --> 01:48:35,246
See..

1311
01:48:36,877 --> 01:48:38,550
..how the Rain God has blessed us..

1312
01:48:51,292 --> 01:48:53,636
Hey dear, what are you doing here..

1313
01:48:53,794 --> 01:48:55,296
He is refuses to come with me.

1314
01:48:55,563 --> 01:48:59,170
Out in this rain, won't he get
a fever and catch a cold?

1315
01:48:59,333 --> 01:49:01,836
Dear, even you will fall sick.

1316
01:49:02,069 --> 01:49:04,743
I won't go without him.

1317
01:49:04,939 --> 01:49:08,318
And what about the villagers
who are drenched in rain?

1318
01:49:08,776 --> 01:49:11,757
You promised to build
homes for all of us..

1319
01:49:11,912 --> 01:49:14,950
You changed your look and
forgot your promises.

1320
01:49:15,049 --> 01:49:17,120
I will complain to my God.

1321
01:49:17,218 --> 01:49:18,822
Only he can teach you
a good lesson.

1322
01:49:22,323 --> 01:49:25,793
Come let's go inside.

1323
01:49:32,300 --> 01:49:35,941
Sir,
he has cheated the poor farmers"

1324
01:49:36,303 --> 01:49:37,805
He snatched their shelters"

1325
01:49:37,905 --> 01:49:40,351
He tortured them to death..

1326
01:49:40,941 --> 01:49:43,080
Where will these poor people go?

1327
01:49:43,677 --> 01:49:46,180
He should be punished"

1328
01:49:46,914 --> 01:49:49,895
That's why we've got
these people here..

1329
01:49:49,984 --> 01:49:51,793
What nonsense is all this?

1330
01:49:53,253 --> 01:49:54,664
How dare you enter my house?

1331
01:49:54,789 --> 01:49:56,735
Sangram, you started it all..

1332
01:49:56,924 --> 01:49:58,198
..by burning down their homes.

1333
01:49:58,626 --> 01:50:00,799
These poor villagers need a shelter
during the monsoons..

1334
01:50:01,395 --> 01:50:05,707
They will stay here until
you build their houses.

1335
01:50:05,933 --> 01:50:07,913
I have nothing to do
with these men.

1336
01:50:08,869 --> 01:50:10,678
I have legally purchased the land..

1337
01:50:10,771 --> 01:50:12,944
..and I am free to pee on my
land or set it on fire..

1338
01:50:14,041 --> 01:50:15,714
Don't get so desperate to pee..

1339
01:50:15,943 --> 01:50:17,923
Just wait and watch the fun.

1340
01:50:22,116 --> 01:50:28,624
Show me your legal agreements.

1341
01:50:28,989 --> 01:50:30,866
But who the hell are
you to question me?

1342
01:50:31,025 --> 01:50:33,005
Mr. Collector, please make
a note of his behavior..

1343
01:50:33,060 --> 01:50:34,903
How can he be so rude
in your presence?

1344
01:50:35,896 --> 01:50:40,140
I hope you know these officials.
Don't you?

1345
01:50:41,001 --> 01:50:43,174
Sir, he doesn't have any
legal agreements.

1346
01:50:43,303 --> 01:50:45,305
Yet he forces poor people
out of their homes..

1347
01:50:45,673 --> 01:50:46,981
He sets their houses on fire.

1348
01:50:47,207 --> 01:50:50,711
Mr. Collector, I request you
to look into this matter.

1349
01:50:51,078 --> 01:50:52,318
Our documents are missing.

1350
01:50:52,379 --> 01:50:53,687
Someone has robbed us.

1351
01:50:54,915 --> 01:50:56,292
What, our documents got stolen?

1352
01:50:56,350 --> 01:50:57,693
Robbed you?

1353
01:50:58,452 --> 01:51:02,400
Nope.. the robber got robbed.

1354
01:51:03,291 --> 01:51:05,897
Now.. who are you going
to complain about this?

1355
01:51:06,961 --> 01:51:10,636
Mr. Collector,
please use their stolen wealth..

1356
01:51:11,064 --> 01:51:13,305
..and give the villagers
their homes.

1357
01:51:13,734 --> 01:51:19,150
Now you can pee in a hurry
without any worry..

1358
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:22,878
Hey guys" go feel comfortable
this is your new home.

1359
01:51:53,874 --> 01:51:55,080
Sangram..

1360
01:51:56,844 --> 01:51:57,914
No bloody fights.

1361
01:51:58,011 --> 01:51:59,046
Bloody, no fun.

1362
01:52:13,761 --> 01:52:14,762
Who are you?

1363
01:52:15,329 --> 01:52:16,307
Kavita..

1364
01:52:17,898 --> 01:52:18,876
My name is Kavita.

1365
01:52:19,032 --> 01:52:20,010
Please sit.

So I came here, to be with him.

1369
01:52:32,279 --> 01:52:33,314
<i>OK".</i>

1370
01:52:37,017 --> 01:52:39,520
Mother-in-law.. Please accept me.

1371
01:52:39,787 --> 01:52:42,097
Hey, please get up.
-No. I won't leave you.

1372
01:52:42,156 --> 01:52:46,127
You promise to accept me
as your daughter-in-law.

1373
01:52:46,460 --> 01:52:48,804
Why would I reject..
-Reject?

1374
01:52:49,096 --> 01:52:50,336
Oh! Please don't reject me.

1375
01:52:50,898 --> 01:52:53,378

01:52:53,934 --> 01:52:54,912
Shut up!
-l..

1377
01:52:55,169 --> 01:52:57,240
Just shut up, and let me speak.

1378
01:52:58,372 --> 01:52:59,407
Sure, go ahead.

1379
01:52:59,874 --> 01:53:02,514
Your Mauli is still
the same person.

1380
01:53:02,976 --> 01:53:06,753
Who am I to interfere
in your love affairs?

1381
01:53:07,014 --> 01:53:08,049
You..

1382
01:53:08,382 --> 01:53:09,360
Come..

1383
01:53:09,483 --> 01:53:10,757
I will be back.

1384
01:53:13,120 --> 01:53:14,963
You are too desperate to
get married, is it?

1385
01:53:15,022 --> 01:53:16,330
Who invited you here?

1386
01:53:16,423 --> 01:53:18,403
I don't need any invitation.

1387
01:53:18,825 --> 01:53:20,202
I do what I want.

1388
01:53:20,294 --> 01:53:22,035
Nonsense.

1389
01:53:22,429 --> 01:53:26,138
Why were you trying to
get close to her?

1390
01:53:26,267 --> 01:53:29,805
And listen, I have nothing
to do with that lady.

1391
01:53:30,104 --> 01:53:31,845
Hey, how can you say that?

1392
01:53:32,039 --> 01:53:34,849
She is your mother. -You came here
all the way just for her..

1393
01:53:34,909 --> 01:53:35,887
Mother?

1394
01:53:36,376 --> 01:53:38,822
Does she even know what the word,
'mother' means?

1395
01:53:39,146 --> 01:53:41,353
My parents are in Pandharpur.

1396
01:53:41,448 --> 01:53:43,257
I came here on their wish.

1397
01:53:43,350 --> 01:53:46,331
Whoa.. that's amazing..

1398
01:53:46,887 --> 01:53:48,332
Please do ask your God..

1399
01:53:48,889 --> 01:53:51,460
What if you were in
Prince's p
ace.. ?

1400
01:53:51,926 --> 01:53:53,405
Agreed,
your Lord Vitthal raised you.

1401
01:53:53,460 --> 01:53:55,269
But she is the one who
saved you from dying.

1402
01:53:55,562 --> 01:53:58,907
Understand,
your God rules everyone.

1403
01:53:59,200 --> 01:54:02,272
Please ask him for his plans
for you, then.. and now..

1404
01:54:04,238 --> 01:54:05,911
Nonsense.

1405
01:54:16,883 --> 01:54:20,490
It's so difficult to
handle these women..

1406
01:54:20,988 --> 01:54:23,093
How do you manage..

1407
01:54:23,190 --> 01:54:28,230
..your wife and that little girl?

1408
01:54:30,097 --> 01:54:31,633
By being silent.

1409
01:54:33,066 --> 01:54:36,445
Yeah.. because you don't drink.

1410
01:54:40,874 --> 01:54:43,946
A hard blow in life will
make you quit too.

1411
01:54:44,945 --> 01:54:47,619
Let's see..

1412
01:54:48,282 --> 01:54:50,159
I was very careless,
just like you..

1413
01:54:50,451 --> 01:54:51,987
I used to booze a lot.

1414
01:54:53,387 --> 01:54:54,388
Prince said"

1415
01:54:54,454 --> 01:54:56,627
..the day I get the blow of my
life, I will quit drinking.

1416
01:54:58,225 --> 01:55:00,171
He went away leaving us..
and I quit drinking.

1417
01:55:04,098 --> 01:55:07,272
I will avenge Prince's death..

1418
01:55:09,102 --> 01:55:11,275
I will settle the scores
with everyone.

1419
01:55:12,439 --> 01:55:13,611
You just wait and watch.

1420
01:55:14,608 --> 01:55:16,281
'May you get the blow
of your life..

1421
01:55:16,343 --> 01:55:18,118
..and may you quit drinking
one day.. '

1422
01:55:22,016 --> 01:55:25,225
You both are so similar"

1423
01:55:28,022 --> 01:55:30,059
Thank you so much Mau
i..

1424
01:55:30,557 --> 01:55:34,699
Your presence has lessened
my grief..

1425
01:55:35,028 --> 01:55:36,302
Of course"

1426
01:55:37,364 --> 01:55:39,037
Because, my kick is smashing"

1427
01:55:39,299 --> 01:55:41,245
..my punch is amazing..

1428
01:55:43,303 --> 01:55:44,941
Let's have one more.

1429
01:55:45,339 --> 01:55:48,286
Mauli, we are getting late.
Let's 
eave..

1430
01:55:48,742 --> 01:55:51,154
Who is getting late?

1431
01:55:51,411 --> 01:55:53,118
Hey“ please..
-You are getting late..

1432
01:55:53,447 --> 01:55:54,619
So you leave.

1433
01:55:54,715 --> 01:55:57,958
You are getting late right?
You leave, please..

1434
01:55:59,052 --> 01:56:02,090
I still have a long way to go..
my friend.

1435
01:56:13,300 --> 01:56:15,246
Hey.. who are you?

1436
01:56:15,335 --> 01:56:17,008
Who are you?

1437
01:56:21,308 --> 01:56:22,548
Brother, you?

1438
01:56:22,776 --> 01:56:24,278
Brother, you?

1439
01:56:24,378 --> 01:56:26,984
Brother, how are you?
-I'm fine brother.

1440
01:56:27,681 --> 01:56:30,184
So are you flying high?
-Yeah..

1441
01:56:30,250 --> 01:56:32,457
Even my spirits are pretty high.

1442
01:56:33,353 --> 01:56:34,627
Hey brother.
-Yes.

1443
01:56:34,721 --> 01:56:36,701
May I ask you a personal question?

1444
01:56:37,090 --> 01:56:38,228
Sure, go ahead..

1445
01:56:38,425 --> 01:56:42,498
Have you ever been in love?

1446
01:56:48,201 --> 01:56:50,647
Ask me,
when did I not fall in love?

1447
01:56:51,104 --> 01:56:53,311
Brother..
-Sorry brother, I got emotional.

1448
01:56:53,540 --> 01:56:57,647
My babe has pissed me off.

1449
01:56:58,011 --> 01:56:59,251
Pissed you off?
-Yes.

1450
01:56:59,413 --> 01:57:02,053
She shouts at me.
-She shouts at you?

1451
01:57:02,115 --> 01:57:04,356
What does she think of herself?

1452
01:57:04,518 --> 01:57:07,624
How can she lecture me?

1453
01:57:09,089 --> 01:57:12,593
She is a lady, so she reserves
the right to lecture you.

1454
01:57:13,127 --> 01:57:14,504
What do you mean?

1455
01:57:15,229 --> 01:57:16,537
Let me explain..

1456
01:57:17,364 --> 01:57:19,366
This is the most common
effect of love..

1457
01:57:20,433 --> 01:57:22,674
Let's assume you made a mistake.

1458
01:57:22,736 --> 01:57:24,647
So it's natural, she gets upset.

1459
01:57:25,305 --> 01:57:26,784
And you apologize to her,
by saying"

1460
01:57:26,840 --> 01:57:28,717
..."l am sorry"
-Yeah..

1461
01:57:28,809 --> 01:57:30,186
That's the right way.

1462
01:57:30,277 --> 01:57:32,279
If in case, she errs..

1463
01:57:33,280 --> 01:57:35,521
...still she is the one
to get upset. -Yeah..

1464
01:57:35,582 --> 01:57:37,255
And again you have to
apologize to her..

1465
01:57:37,718 --> 01:57:39,129
“By saying, 'lam sorry'.

1466
01:57:39,786 --> 01:57:40,764
Which means"

1467
01:57:40,821 --> 01:57:43,768
We get to say 'I love
you' just onc:e..

1468
01:57:44,191 --> 01:57:48,037
...and all our life,
we end-up saying, 'I am sorry'.

1469
01:57:48,128 --> 01:57:49,300
Yeah..

1470
01:57:49,763 --> 01:57:54,439
...our entire life..
We don't apologize to her.. -Then..

1471
01:57:54,501 --> 01:57:56,708
In fact,
we apologize to ourselves.

1472
01:57:56,870 --> 01:58:00,613
For confessing our love to
her in the first p
ace..

1473
01:58:00,774 --> 01:58:01,752
Correct..

1474
01:58:02,309 --> 01:58:06,121
Brother,
to hell with our love and apology.

1475
01:58:06,213 --> 01:58:07,248
IS it?

1476
01:58:07,347 --> 01:58:08,655
I will set her straight?
-Yes.

1477
01:58:08,748 --> 01:58:10,489
-What the hell she
thinks of herself?

1478
01:58:10,550 --> 01:58:12,427
Hey brother..

1479
01:58:12,619 --> 01:58:14,428
It doesn't work that way..

1480
01:58:14,655 --> 01:58:23,405
lam an experienced man
listen to what I say..

1481
01:58:26,266 --> 01:58:28,143
Brother..
-Brother?

1482
01:58:28,201 --> 01:58:29,373
Now do you understand?

1483
01:58:29,536 --> 01:58:31,174
Yeah..

1484
01:58:31,805 --> 01:58:34,376
Brother,
convey my regards to your babe.

1485
01:58:34,708 --> 01:58:36,619
Sure brother.

1486
01:58:36,710 --> 01:58:38,621
Hey brother..
-What?

1487
01:58:39,446 --> 01:58:41,687
You too please convey
my regards to her..

1488
01:58:41,782 --> 01:58:43,125
May I know who?

1489
01:58:43,383 --> 01:58:45,454
Your latest obsession..

1490
01:58:46,253 --> 01:58:47,288
Her?
-Yeah.

1491
01:58:47,387 --> 01:58:48,695
Oh sure"

1492
01:58:48,822 --> 01:58:50,301
You are amazing brother..

1493
01:58:50,390 --> 01:58:51,562
Yeah I am.. I know..

1494
01:58:51,758 --> 01:58:53,203
Okay will take your leave..

1495
01:58:53,260 --> 01:58:54,102
Okay brother..

1496
01:58:54,394 --> 01:58:56,874
Who the hell does she
think of herself?

1497
01:58:57,464 --> 01:58:59,466
I don't want such a girlfriend.

1498
01:58:59,633 --> 01:59:02,876
I hate being 
ectured..

1499
01:59:03,870 --> 01:59:05,713
How can she argue with me?

1500
01:59:06,173 --> 01:59:08,653
How dare she.. ?

1501
01:59:09,943 --> 01:59:12,423
Who is hiding there?

1502
01:59:12,512 --> 01:59:13,718
Hey come in front..

1503
01:59:29,529 --> 01:59:30,837
Kavita?

1504
01:59:37,237 --> 01:59:38,238
Sangram!

1505
01:59:38,505 --> 01:59:40,280
You burnt down my bar..

1506
01:59:40,807 --> 01:59:42,650
Now you have to pay up..

1507
01:59:43,310 --> 01:59:44,288
Of course I will“.

1508
01:59:44,745 --> 01:59:46,281
This is not ac:c:eptable..

1509
01:59:46,680 --> 01:59:48,887
Today you are sober and I am not..

1510
01:59:49,549 --> 01:59:50,527
That's not fair.

1511
01:59:50,617 --> 01:59:53,564
Let's meet tomorrow,
or you get drunk..

1512
01:59:53,753 --> 01:59:54,925
I will wait for you“.

1513
02:01:21,808 --> 02:01:24,482
Sakha.. did we bring him here to..

1514
02:01:24,578 --> 02:01:26,990
..get drunk and get into brawls?

1515
02:01:27,747 --> 02:01:29,749
He is of no use to us.

1516
02:01:30,517 --> 02:01:33,589
He just cannot be compared
to our Prince.

1517
02:01:34,387 --> 02:01:42,533
This illiterate and uncouth guy
will just bring shame to us.

1518
02:01:43,096 --> 02:01:44,074
Whoa!

1519
02:01:44,965 --> 02:01:47,343
Ms. Sumitra Devi..

1520
02:01:47,800 --> 02:01:52,772
Don't forget you are responsible
for my condition.

1521
02:01:53,974 --> 02:01:57,478
You should have thought about this,
before coming to me.

1522
02:01:58,611 --> 02:02:02,684
You showered your love and
affection on Prince..

1523
02:02:02,983 --> 02:02:04,394
..and abandoned me.

1524
02:02:05,118 --> 02:02:07,530
During those insomniac nights,
booze was my only companion.

1525
02:02:07,721 --> 02:02:09,598
Hey Sakha.. Please tell her.

1526
02:02:09,823 --> 02:02:12,997
She can go look for someone
else to help her..

1527
02:02:16,763 --> 02:02:17,935
Ms. Sumitra Devi..

1528
02:02:18,899 --> 02:02:22,972
I may be a street urchin..
still, I have my self-respect.

1529
02:03:10,050 --> 02:03:11,859
Vitthala, my father..

1530
02:03:13,453 --> 02:03:14,898
I am sorry"

1531
02:03:16,056 --> 02:03:20,095
In Pandharpur,
we spoke heartily, every night.

1532
02:03:21,861 --> 02:03:23,534
Here, we skipped that completely“.

1533
02:03:23,797 --> 02:03:25,538
I guess that's the reason
for this mess.

1534
02:03:27,834 --> 02:03:31,077
I was under the impression
you are my dad.

1535
02:03:31,638 --> 02:03:36,109
This lady says, she is my mom
and Pratap Singh is my dad.

1536
02:03:37,644 --> 02:03:43,720
Her story sounds exactly
like a movie script.

1537
02:03:45,718 --> 02:03:49,029
The point here is..

1538
02:03:49,923 --> 02:03:54,201
Though she claims to be my mother..

1539
02:03:55,829 --> 02:03:58,036
But not once she behaved
like my mother.

1540
02:03:59,165 --> 02:04:01,543
She discarded me when
I was just an infant.

1541
02:04:02,001 --> 02:04:04,003
Later when she met me
after so many years"

1542
02:04:04,604 --> 02:04:05,674
..forget a warm hug..

1543
02:04:05,738 --> 02:04:08,014
..she didn't even care for
a simple hand shake.

1544
02:04:08,675 --> 02:04:13,624
All she spoke about was her
family and their lineage.

1545
02:04:14,214 --> 02:04:16,216
Am I not her family?

1546
02:04:17,484 --> 02:04:23,093
All these years I pined
for her love.

1547
02:04:23,723 --> 02:04:28,229
And she didn't care to ask me,
how I spent my life all alone?

1548
02:04:29,863 --> 02:04:32,139
She came to me through
your reference.

1549
02:04:32,732 --> 02:04:35,872
And I entertained her
for this sole reason.

1550
02:04:36,536 --> 02:04:38,106
Why are you torturing me so much?

1551
02:04:39,172 --> 02:04:41,243
Please take me back to Pandharpur.

1552
02:04:45,712 --> 02:04:48,454
I don't want any of them.

1553
02:04:49,182 --> 02:04:50,991
I just want to go back
to Pandharpur.

1554
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:11,073
That stupid Sakha landed up
and spoilt my game plan.

1555
02:05:14,974 --> 02:05:16,920
Sakha..

1556
02:05:19,813 --> 02:05:21,588
He has a son or a daughter?

1557
02:06:54,240 --> 02:06:56,083
Mauli!

1558
02:06:58,711 --> 02:06:59,883
Hey Rukmini..

1559
02:07:00,380 --> 02:07:01,381
My little mother..

1560
02:07:01,814 --> 02:07:03,623
Stop crying dear..

1561
02:07:05,051 --> 02:07:10,262
..with your arms akimbo,
you look so stunning.

1562
02:07:13,193 --> 02:07:15,639
Cry baby Rakhumai..
Sat in a corner..

1563
02:07:15,729 --> 02:07:17,640
"let's go and console her..

1564
02:07:21,968 --> 02:07:23,038
Look here.

1565
02:07:23,837 --> 02:07:25,009
Do you remember this?

1566
02:07:33,379 --> 02:07:35,859
You made her a promise
to cheer her up..

1567
02:07:36,849 --> 02:07:39,056
Now, how are you going to
fulfill your promise?

1568
02:07:40,186 --> 02:07:43,099
I have a solution"

1569
02:07:43,723 --> 02:07:45,293
Enough of your nonsense"

1570
02:07:45,725 --> 02:07:47,398
I clearly see that you have
no interest in me.

1571
02:07:47,860 --> 02:07:50,033
Now that you have found your real
family, you don't need me.

1572
02:07:50,330 --> 02:07:53,004
I don't need you anymore.

1573
02:07:53,099 --> 02:07:55,136
Kavita, please hear me out.

1574
02:07:55,301 --> 02:07:58,145
Let's live with our people here.

1575
02:07:58,405 --> 02:07:59,975
I will be the way you
want me to be.

1576
02:08:00,073 --> 02:08:01,051
Just shut up..

1577
02:08:01,474 --> 02:08:03,715
Are these guys your family?

1578
02:08:03,977 --> 02:08:07,891
I helped you with my resources
during your struggling days.

1579
02:08:07,980 --> 02:08:09,960
And here you are getting
closer to these people.

1580
02:08:10,283 --> 02:08:13,355
You may look like Prince,
but you will never be 'Prince'.

1581
02:08:14,053 --> 02:08:15,828
You are like a stray dog.

1582
02:08:15,922 --> 02:08:17,424
Stop it I say..

1583
02:08:17,957 --> 02:08:21,302
Who the hell are you?

1584
02:08:21,728 --> 02:08:24,208
To hell with you and your love.

1585
02:08:24,731 --> 02:08:27,302
You are just not worth my love.

1586
02:08:28,234 --> 02:08:32,774
I swear, I will show you your
right place someday.

1587
02:08:33,105 --> 02:08:34,311
Kavita..

1588
02:08:34,741 --> 02:08:36,778
Mau
i's rejected ex-girlfriend.

1589
02:08:36,876 --> 02:08:39,755
Hey.. don't waste my time.

1590
02:08:40,179 --> 02:08:42,022
Just tell me why have
you got me here?

1591
02:08:42,114 --> 02:08:43,320
I will..
-Shut up!

1592
02:08:43,849 --> 02:08:45,123
Hey.. I warn you..

1593
02:08:47,086 --> 02:08:51,296
Dear, you need to be calm and
think clear to avenge.

1594
02:08:53,292 --> 02:08:58,105
You are bright,
just don't overreact.

1595
02:08:59,332 --> 02:09:01,869
I hope you still want to avenge
Mau
i.. Don't you?

1596
02:09:02,368 --> 02:09:04,143
Yeah..
What has that got to do with you?

1597
02:09:04,237 --> 02:09:06,308
Of course it concerns me.

1598
02:09:08,274 --> 02:09:10,379
I want you to bring Mauli to me..

1599
02:09:10,476 --> 02:09:12,922
..to a place of my choice,
and at my will.

1600
02:09:14,380 --> 02:09:17,190
What do I get in return?

1601
02:09:17,884 --> 02:09:19,830
Tell me how much money do you want?

1602
02:09:23,522 --> 02:09:25,729
I sold off a piece of
land to come here..

1603
02:09:26,793 --> 02:09:28,363
Can you give me my land.
-Done.

1604
02:09:30,329 --> 02:09:35,335
You can take possession of
as much land you want.

1605
02:09:36,903 --> 02:09:40,180
Sangram, what is this?

1606
02:09:41,374 --> 02:09:43,285
Hey, tick took.

1607
02:09:45,311 --> 02:09:48,224
You started feeling jealous seeing
our friendship, is it?

1608
02:09:54,053 --> 02:09:55,930
Will you not invite
me to your place?

1609
02:10:01,828 --> 02:10:02,932
Hello..

1610
02:10:04,797 --> 02:10:05,775
Mauli!

1611
02:10:33,559 --> 02:10:35,436
"I can feel the passion. "

1612
02:10:35,895 --> 02:10:37,897
"Stirring up in me.. "

1613
02:10:38,131 --> 02:10:41,044
"Making me go crazy for you.. "

1614
02:10:42,835 --> 02:10:49,912
"Let this fire burn and
scorch me completely."

1615
02:10:50,643 --> 02:10:54,523
"This chilly breeze is
driving me crazy.. "

1616
02:10:54,848 --> 02:10:59,558
"Can't control my emotions
anymore.. "

1617
02:10:59,953 --> 02:11:08,270
"Come and accept a passionate
kiss from me.. Oh dear."

1618
02:11:08,661 --> 02:11:13,132
"Come to me.. Oh my darling.. "

1619
02:11:13,366 --> 02:11:17,644
"Take me in your arms" "

1620
02:11:18,003 --> 02:11:22,076
"Come to me.. Oh my darling.. "

1621
02:11:22,341 --> 02:11:27,154
"
 want to feel your touch.. "

1622
02:11:27,346 --> 02:11:29,053
"I am all yours."

1623
02:11:37,656 --> 02:11:42,127
"I can feel the passion
stirring up in me."

1624
02:11:42,428 --> 02:11:45,034
"Driving me crazy for you.. "

1625
02:12:15,495 --> 02:12:19,671
"I am in trance, I am lost,"

1626
02:12:20,166 --> 02:12:24,581
"Please accept my love.. Oh dear."

1627
02:12:24,670 --> 02:12:29,050
"Oh I am craving for
your sweet embrace,"

1628
02:12:29,275 --> 02:12:33,621
"I want to get drenched
in your love."

1629
02:12:34,013 --> 02:12:38,189
"I am in trance, I am lost,"

1630
02:12:38,484 --> 02:12:42,990
"Please accept my love.. Oh dear."

1631
02:12:43,122 --> 02:12:47,332
"Oh I am craving for
your sweet embrace,"

1632
02:12:47,593 --> 02:12:51,666
"I want to get drenched
in your love."

1633
02:12:52,231 --> 02:13:00,981
"My love, I just want to spend
some lonely time with you."

1634
02:13:01,340 --> 02:13:05,186
"This chilly breeze is
making me go crazy.. "

1635
02:13:05,344 --> 02:13:09,690
"Can't control my emotions
anymore.. "

1636
02:13:09,982 --> 02:13:14,055
"Come to me oh my darling.. "

1637
02:13:14,754 --> 02:13:18,964
"Take me in your arms" "

1638
02:13:19,158 --> 02:13:23,197
"Come to me.. Oh my darling.. "

1639
02:13:23,596 --> 02:13:28,477
"
 want to feel your touch.. "

1640
02:13:28,734 --> 02:13:30,304
"I am all yours."

1641
02:13:31,137 --> 02:13:32,639
"I am all yours."

1642
02:13:33,405 --> 02:13:34,645
"I am all yours."

1643
02:13:53,393 --> 02:13:55,100
Kavita..

1644
02:13:55,461 --> 02:13:57,805
Looks like you are in a hurry..

1645
02:13:58,697 --> 02:14:00,574
Kindly verify the documents
before you leave..

1646
02:14:00,633 --> 02:14:03,204
Just see if I have I signed or
scrawled some swear words?

1647
02:14:11,277 --> 02:14:13,814
Oh.. you have mentioned
your filthy identity.

1648
02:14:15,648 --> 02:14:21,724
You think it's so easy to fool me?

1649
02:14:22,789 --> 02:14:25,326
You have no clue what kind
of a person I am.

1650
02:14:25,524 --> 02:14:28,095
I will never fall for
such silly tricks.

1651
02:14:29,562 --> 02:14:30,836
Perhaps, if you want..

1652
02:14:31,096 --> 02:14:33,098
Don't touch me.

1653
02:14:33,666 --> 02:14:35,236
If you attempt to touch me again..

1654
02:14:35,301 --> 02:14:36,746
I will burn you alive.

1655
02:14:37,270 --> 02:14:39,113
I will love it.

1656
02:14:39,372 --> 02:14:42,478
I want to get scorched in the
fire of your passion.

1657
02:14:44,544 --> 02:14:46,319
Sangram..

1658
02:14:47,213 --> 02:14:51,855
I have an exchange offer for you.

1659
02:14:52,851 --> 02:14:54,455
Return me my television set.

1660
02:14:54,687 --> 02:14:56,291
And take your mixer with you.

1661
02:14:58,591 --> 02:15:00,264
She is of no use to me Mauli.

1662
02:15:00,460 --> 02:15:03,134
You are wasting your time.

1663
02:15:03,529 --> 02:15:05,805
Let me end your offer.

1664
02:15:15,541 --> 02:15:17,350
Sangram..

1665
02:15:32,825 --> 02:15:34,600
Relax!

1666
02:15:35,361 --> 02:15:37,341
It's okay.

1667
02:15:37,663 --> 02:15:39,472
It's okay.

1668
02:15:48,608 --> 02:15:49,712
You?

1669
02:15:50,509 --> 02:15:51,613
Be more respectful“.

1670
02:15:52,311 --> 02:15:53,756
lam Sumitra Devi..

1671
02:15:54,146 --> 02:15:55,557
The rightful owner of this house.

1672
02:15:55,681 --> 02:15:56,751
Owner, huh?

1673
02:15:59,685 --> 02:16:01,790
Don't you remember,
the penny I threw upon you..

1674
02:16:01,954 --> 02:16:04,457
..and howl pushed you
out of this house?

1675
02:16:04,723 --> 02:16:06,225
I haven't forgotten anything.

1676
02:16:06,325 --> 02:16:07,326
Perhaps, you have.

1677
02:16:08,627 --> 02:16:13,940
You are out to erase our family
respect and lineage.

1678
02:16:14,767 --> 02:16:17,441
You and your father had
no status whatsoever.

1679
02:16:17,903 --> 02:16:20,406
You both,
would've ended up as laborers.

1680
02:16:20,606 --> 02:16:23,177
..had my husband not supported you.

1681
02:16:23,743 --> 02:16:26,314
You are struggling too hard
at this stage of your life.

1682
02:16:26,679 --> 02:16:28,420
I understand your emotions.

1683
02:16:28,714 --> 02:16:33,220
Uncle was lucky to have
a statue of himself"

1684
02:16:33,686 --> 02:16:35,791
Don't expect even a tombstone
for yourself.

1685
02:16:36,255 --> 02:16:38,326
You haven't changed a bit.

1686
02:16:39,558 --> 02:16:40,832
But remember..

1687
02:16:41,594 --> 02:16:43,631
lam Mrs. Pratap Singh..

1688
02:16:44,730 --> 02:16:46,539
If needed, we won't hesitate even..

1689
02:16:46,632 --> 02:16:48,373
...to chop off our enemies' heads.

1690
02:16:49,001 --> 02:16:51,572
But I will not taint
my husband's soul..

1691
02:16:51,670 --> 02:16:53,274
..with your impure blood.

1692
02:16:53,573 --> 02:16:58,318
I know who is instigating you.

1693
02:16:59,278 --> 02:17:01,952
Don't expect a mosquito like Mauli
get the taste of my blood.

1694
02:17:03,482 --> 02:17:06,986
Sangram, I don't have the animal
instinct to savour blood..

1695
02:17:08,387 --> 02:17:09,889
And, your blood is the filthiest.

1696
02:17:09,989 --> 02:17:11,627
..for even the dogs to come near.

1697
02:17:11,724 --> 02:17:13,761
Mr. Karna from Pandharpur..

1698
02:17:13,959 --> 02:17:15,996
Don't forget I ended your brother,
'Arjuna's story.

1699
02:17:16,229 --> 02:17:18,766
I will finish off this Mahabharata
along with you and your 'Kunti'.

1700
02:17:18,964 --> 02:17:20,443
You bloody scoundrel.

1701
02:17:20,800 --> 02:17:22,677
The Mahabharata is about to begin.

1702
02:17:22,835 --> 02:17:24,644
Get the taste of your own medicine.

1703
02:17:26,439 --> 02:17:27,611
Nandini..

1704
02:17:38,484 --> 02:17:39,622
Yeah.. Sangram..

1705
02:17:39,918 --> 02:17:41,556
Get ready. Your game is over.

1706
02:17:41,754 --> 02:17:44,030
You made a huge mistake
by firing at me.

1707
02:17:44,357 --> 02:17:48,567
Sangram, get ready.. It's time
to go to your rightful place.

1708
02:17:48,728 --> 02:17:51,641
Your time is up.

1709
02:18:01,440 --> 02:18:06,890
Sangram,
you were raised by our generosity.

1710
02:18:07,546 --> 02:18:10,891
Yet you forgot your past.

1711
02:18:12,084 --> 02:18:17,591
..and you tried to erase everything
we did for you.

1712
02:18:18,424 --> 02:18:23,066
Because of you,
my son, died an innocent death.

1713
02:18:24,696 --> 02:18:26,676
The day you get executed..

1714
02:18:28,834 --> 02:18:33,510
I want you to hold this
'Penny' in your fist.

1715
02:18:37,843 --> 02:18:40,346
Humans come into existence
with a clenched fist.

1716
02:18:41,814 --> 02:18:44,886
This should remind you of your
ugly past, when you die.

1717
02:19:02,101 --> 02:19:03,341
Hello..

1718
02:19:04,970 --> 02:19:06,040
What?

1719
02:19:09,341 --> 02:19:10,752
Are you going back?

1720
02:19:13,745 --> 02:19:15,622
Yeah.. we are even now.

1721
02:19:17,416 --> 02:19:19,760
You abandoned me 25 years ago.

1722
02:19:20,585 --> 02:19:22,428
Today I get to abandon you and go.

1723
02:19:23,756 --> 02:19:25,099
Pandharpur is my destination.

1724
02:19:25,424 --> 02:19:31,397
Mau
i..
A kid is everything for a mother.

1725
02:19:32,965 --> 02:19:35,536
Pandharpur is everything for me.

1726
02:19:38,070 --> 02:19:40,573
You wanted to avenge
your son's death.

1727
02:19:40,739 --> 02:19:42,343
Lord Vitthal ordered
me to help you.

1728
02:19:42,608 --> 02:19:44,349
I have accomplished your task.

1729
02:19:46,912 --> 02:19:49,051
I don't belong to this palace.

1730
02:19:49,815 --> 02:19:51,795
I was lucky to spend
a few days here.

1731
02:19:52,183 --> 02:19:53,662
I don't need it anymore.

1732
02:19:53,852 --> 02:19:55,889
Pandharpur is where my heart lies.

1733
02:22:13,926 --> 02:22:18,238
You said, you came here on Lord
Vittha
a's insistence.

1734
02:22:20,031 --> 02:22:22,875
He introduced you to your
mom and brother..

1735
02:22:23,168 --> 02:22:26,047
How can you abandon your
family and walk away?

1736
02:22:27,039 --> 02:22:29,041
And what do you have in Pandharpur?

1737
02:22:34,279 --> 02:22:35,519
It's my fate.

1738
02:22:39,284 --> 02:22:41,855
Don't blame your fate, Mauli.

1739
02:22:42,620 --> 02:22:44,793
You gave so much to your mom..

1740
02:22:45,124 --> 02:22:47,764
..why can't you be a doting son?

1741
02:22:48,360 --> 02:22:50,271
Just shut up please.

1742
02:22:51,063 --> 02:22:53,304
Looks like you more interested
in this newly found luxury.

1743
02:22:55,867 --> 02:22:58,211
Devotees throng to get
a glimpse of my Lord..

1744
02:22:58,937 --> 02:23:00,780
He looked after me all along..

1745
02:23:01,940 --> 02:23:03,180
..you want me to betray him?

1746
02:23:08,346 --> 02:23:09,347
Hello.

1747
02:23:47,786 --> 02:23:49,060
Sakha!

1748
02:24:13,745 --> 02:24:14,815
Sakha!

1749
02:24:20,719 --> 02:24:23,325
Sakha, are you okay?

1750
02:24:24,823 --> 02:24:26,063
