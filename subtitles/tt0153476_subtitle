1
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:26,004
Second World War had just begun

2
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,028
Mr Sanyal doesn't seem to be in a mood
to emerge from the boss' office

3
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:53,930
What's the matter, Latu ?
- Grave matter, serious,

4
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:56,898
very very serious.
- Meaning...?

5
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:05,307
Meaning, finance. Uncle Sen, is now in
the business of trading in scrap iron

6
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:09,119
But it'll take lots of money.
- So what, he owns this bank and...

7
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:12,389
for the rest, there are financiers.
- Financiers ?

8
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:17,560
The little gentlemen from the Pacific,
who flaunt the flag of the rising Sun,

9
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:19,387
the Japanese

10
00:03:58,471 --> 00:03:59,597
Mr Sanyal...
- Yes sir ?

11
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:02,434
This file goes into the office vault.
- Right, sir

12
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:18,850
What news Latu ?
- The money has reached London

13
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:23,222
Thank you

14
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,895
Operator, dial my residence

15
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,809
ls Rathin around ?
- No, he isn't at home

16
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:54,489
l see. lnform him that the money
has been deposited in London

17
00:04:55,928 --> 00:05:02,163
Ask him to be at home this evening.
l want to finalise his London trip

18
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:06,094
That's great Dad, l'll tell him

19
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:14,175
My brother is all set to go to London.
- Really ?

20
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:21,311
And congratulations on your Delhi trip.
- Thanks, but l'm not too enthusiastic

21
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:25,183
Why ?
- Out there, amongst strangers,

22
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:33,258
away from home and you people...
- You mean, me...? But why worry,

23
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:38,026
you're in Daddy's good books.
- You're talk is always oblique

24
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:42,202
lt's the age of obliqueness.
And l not beyond it's pale, Arun

25
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:44,872
Let's go shopping.
- Very well

26
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:18,240
Hello Sanat, welcome. What news ?

27
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:22,911
Still nursing the rheumatism ?
- Refuses to let go of me

28
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:25,173
Bless you

29
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:27,585
Come upstairs

30
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:31,589
Come and sit here

31
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,390
Please make yourselves comfortable

32
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:42,590
Why the summons ?
- For good reason

33
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:50,269
Have you considered my proposal ?
- About your iron smelter ?

34
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:56,604
Out of selling iron scrap
to the Japanese,

35
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:01,352
l'll enrich myself somewhat,
but it won't enrich the country

36
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:06,623
l believe, unless there is industry,
no nation can grow

37
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:15,031
l wish, you know, to lay the foundations
of another industrial family, alike Tata

38
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:18,971
Noble idea.
- To which end,

39
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:22,641
l'm taking on board,
Arati and Rathin

40
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:29,971
Since we're close, l'd like you and Latu
on my board too. What is your opinion ?

41
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:33,811
Where's the question of opinion, uncle ?
Whatever you wish, will be done

42
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:37,819
Oh hi folks

43
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:40,989
Hi Latu, when did you arrive ?
- A while ago

44
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,229
What about your trip to London ?
- He's leaving in ten days or so

45
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:47,996
Wonderful

46
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:05,811
Your ship leaves in ten days.
l'm sending you ahead of time,

47
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:10,284
so that you can be in London
at least a month ahead of the session

48
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:12,190
l'm all set, Dad

49
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:19,028
lt's only four years. But you must acquire
the specialisation in higher engineering

50
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:23,691
lt's going to be fun for my brother.
Four years of England-America

51
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:29,036
Why only me ? Dad will be travelling, to
look up steel plants. You can tag along

52
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:34,702
Yes, it's been on my mind. And by then,
you will have acquired the masters' degree

53
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:41,947
l'd like to take Arun along too,
provided you agree, of course

54
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:50,885
London bombed. Countless dead, injured
Several precincts reduced to rubble

55
00:08:54,901 --> 00:09:01,739
Dad, no letter from Rathin ?
- No. This news of London air raids...

56
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:08,747
is becoming a grave concern.
- Why do men make war ?

57
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:13,082
ln 4000 years of human history
only 1 70 years were free of war

58
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,918
Which problem of humanity was resolved
through war ?

59
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,929
Yet, war is inevitable

60
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:30,565
Against injustice, war must be raged.
Not going to war, would be a social crime

61
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:34,203
What crime ?
The victor is always absolved

62
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,442
That has always been the outcome, from
mythical battles to the First Great War

63
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:41,113
But what use this debate ?

64
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:50,245
lt's a tough question, nowhere in
the world has the answer been found

65
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:55,918
Excuse me, Dad.
- Where are you off to ?

66
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:59,359
l'm going to see Sudha.
- But you've hardly eaten

67
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:01,800
l don't feel like it.
- Strange

68
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:04,970
Now what about your college ?
- l'll go to see Sudha after college

69
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:07,603
But there are no classes at college today,
we have union elections

70
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:12,867
What for are you going to college then ?
Last year, you got into a fight...

71
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:19,482
didn't you ?
- That's over. l extracted an apology

72
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:23,618
No good going to these union meetings.
- l'm not going there to vote

73
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:27,883
l'm going to pick up a book.
- Make sure you're back afterwards

74
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,498
Good morning.
- Good morning, how are you ?

75
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:40,828
Fine, you're back after a long while.
- ls the principal in ?

76
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,232
Yes

77
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:53,351
Oh, is that you, the eternal Subroto.
- Your captain's uniform had me startled

78
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,177
Why ?
- l thought, police !

79
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,356
Any reason to be afraid of the police ?

80
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:00,859
So what are you doing here ?
- Supervising the college elections

81
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,459
Still at it,
so many years after quitting college ?

82
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:08,526
lt's become quite a habit,
now l can't do without it

83
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:11,528
And you...?
- l'm here to see the principal

84
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:13,201
See you.
- Bye

85
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:19,471
Who's he ?
- Probir Chatterjee. Two years my junior

86
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:25,612
Principal's favourite. Used to play
centre-half on the college football team

87
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:30,879
Listen, you hold fort here,
don't you let slip a single vote

88
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,882
Horidas Bagchi must poll
cent percent votes

89
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:35,685
Don't you worry about it.
- See you

90
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,001
Hey, take a look at that

91
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:47,906
Lady Dragon arrives

92
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,106
Wait, let's give her a try

93
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:56,413
Hello and good morning.
So you're voting for Horidas Bagchi ?

94
00:11:56,949 --> 00:12:00,908
No, l'm not voting for anyone,
certainly not for Horidas Bagchi,

95
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,353
after last year's riot using hired goons.
- You're right

96
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:08,518
We won't let outsiders interfere
in student politics

97
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:12,930
Let's vote him out.
- Vote for... Anish Sarkar

98
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,940
l hope this will suffice.
- Yes sir

99
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,945
You're joining the army,
no one in the family is objecting ?

100
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,551
ln the begining, my brother opposed.
Later, he conceded

101
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:40,759
You cissies, it isn't so easy
to pin down Lady Dragon

102
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:43,625
But l know how to do it

103
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:49,361
Listen...

104
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,630
Are you talking to me ?
- Yes, are you staying here for long ?

105
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:56,306
No, l'm only visiting the library.
- You ought not to stay here for long

106
00:12:56,809 --> 00:13:00,301
Why do you say that ?
- l think they're planning to insult you

107
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,647
Who's planning ?
- Do you know Subroto ?

108
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:04,983
Subroto... yes l remember,

109
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:08,585
the one who isn't a student here...
and last year, he turned things nasty

110
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:14,492
l'm ready for a face-off.
- He's a dangerous sort

111
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:17,327
Just tell me where to find him,
l'll go and see him myself

112
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:29,007
You were rusticated from this college
and that was years ago

113
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,673
Maybe that's why you don't know,
my name is Arati Sen

114
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:38,746
Everyday, l park myself
in the restaurant across the college,

115
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:45,684
just to observe you, your make-up,
your shampooed hair drives me crazy

116
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,755
Out of my way

117
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,826
Not to express your agitation.
- l shall scream

118
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:58,526
Before your screams attract attention,
l shall have professed my adoration,

119
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:01,039
then l'll be gone.
- Coward

120
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:06,536
Then l shall not be gone. Before all
onlookers, l shall say, l adore you

121
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,381
l am unafraid of violence

122
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,573
Listen...

123
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,724
He... is insulting me

124
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:26,155
Shame on you, Subroto.
You haven't given up on vulgarism ?

125
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:31,069
Probir, leave.
Between us, this is a personal affair

126
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:38,072
l knew beforehand what's in your
bag of tricks, so find me prepared

127
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:41,411
Do not try to use force,
my arms are very strong

128
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:46,078
When l was a child, a mad fox bit me.
l remember breaking it's jaws

129
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:53,414
l shall take you to the limits of pain
so that it takes long for you to recover

130
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:58,096
Please come with me

131
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:05,602
Now we have a score to settle, Probir

132
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,710
Will you object if l give you a lift ?
- No

133
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:41,537
Please step inside

134
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,708
lt's your home ?
- Yes

135
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:48,141
Also Rathin Sens's residence
and he's away in London ?

136
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:49,644
Yes, my brother

137
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:54,950
Do you know him ?
- Don't l know him, a year my senior

138
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:58,748
We went to the same college. Coincidence.
- Let's keep coincidences for later. Come

139
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,889
Shall l...?
- A friend of my brother's and...

140
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:07,164
l meet you in such dire circumstances,
oh won't you come ?

141
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:10,492
Shall we...

142
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:28,686
Weren't you scared about grabbing
the fox by the jaws ?

143
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:32,188
My sense of fear was always liminal.
- Did it leave you maimed ?

144
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:38,721
Paid my price for bravado, 18 injections
and arms bandaged for 3 months

145
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:42,200
The wounds healed,
but the scars remained

146
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:45,003
Come

147
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:50,735
Dad...

148
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:56,008
he just saved me from a grave insult.
- lnsult...?

149
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:58,741
Be seated... what happened ?

150
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,617
Nothing much

151
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:04,220
A wastrel took the opportunity of
the college elections to insult Ms Sen

152
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:07,957
And he taught him a fitting lesson.
- Was that so ?

153
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:15,499
ls that a military uniform ?
- University Technical Corps

154
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:18,897
Oh l see...
- l've just graduated as an engineer

155
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:21,637
Have you ?
- Yes. l went to the college...

156
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:25,237
to meet the principal, Dr Chowdhury.
l happen to be an ex-student

157
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:28,808
Dad, he also knows Rathin.
- Really ?

158
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:33,914
Yes, he was a year senior to us.
- What's your name ?

159
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:35,650
Probir Chatterjee

160
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,919
Where do you live ?

161
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,919
Once upon a time, we had a house
in Burdwan, nothing remains now

162
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:46,753
ls that so ?
- Both my father and grandfather...

163
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:49,263
were in service.
- What kind of service ?

164
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:51,603
My father was an officer
with the central government

165
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:57,264
About a year ago, he died.
- Oh... is your mother around ?

166
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:01,609
No, my mother preceded my father

167
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:05,348
But l have a brother. He is a
deputy secretary. Posted in Delhi

168
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:12,621
Then my theory is correct.
You know Probir, l have a theory

169
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:17,828
Unless parents are well-educated,
children don't get a good upbringing

170
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,629
Though l don't say,
there are no exceptions

171
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:26,703
So after graduation, will you do an
independent business, or is it a job ?

172
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:32,800
l've decided to join the military.
l have applied for commissioning

173
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:35,040
l think l will obtain a commission

174
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:41,717
Will military life suit you ?
You have a liking for it ?

175
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:47,849
To me, life in military is the ideal life,
a visit to the club after a day's work,

176
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:54,857
followed by sound sleep. Work in wartime
looking at death in the face,

177
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:59,327
amidst flying bullets, bursting shells,
air raids, what bigger a thrill ?

178
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:04,069
Building roads by the day,
building bridges by the week,

179
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:09,143
blasting up passes through mountains,
... l like it, l like it immensely

180
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:15,148
May all be well with you,
you possess the courage

181
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:18,019
l am sure, you'll go far in life

182
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:25,353
l should be on my way, now.
- Leaving ? But do come if you find time

183
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:29,367
Since you know Rothin,
you are like a son to me

184
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:35,362
Arati, do see him off

185
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:36,708
Come

186
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:53,890
Bye for now...?
- Do come again

187
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:56,526
l shall. Bye

188
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,626
Welcome stranger,
have you lost your way ?

189
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:11,199
Somewhat so. l was passing by,
thought l'd drop by,

190
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:13,471
to give you some news.
- News ?

191
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,907
Graduation results have been announced

192
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:21,478
And you have failed ?
- l expected to fail. By some mistake,

193
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,480
they gave me passing grades.
- Really ? l am so delighted

194
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:28,281
That's subject to proof.
- Meaning...?

195
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,215
Treat me to sweets or something

196
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:32,982
l am to give you a treat ?
- Am l to, instead ?

197
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:35,152
lndeed.
- Wonderful

198
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:38,094
l do all the hard work
and l am to give the treat ?

199
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,499
l relent. Now come upstairs
for your treat

200
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:57,176
Please be seated,
l'll be right back

201
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:54,141
Lady...

202
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,274
coffee is served.
- Thanks

203
00:26:58,850 --> 00:26:59,976
Come

204
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:28,312
What are you so engrossed in ?

205
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:30,344
ln you

206
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:36,048
ln me ? l'm nothing exotic

207
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:46,253
Beauty lies in all forms, waiting to be
discovered by the eyes of the beholder

208
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:51,198
Sweets

209
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:12,882
Japan declares war on Allied Forces.
Pearl Harbour attacked

210
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:18,892
Japanese air raids over Singapore.
Warships Prince of Wales and Repulse sunk

211
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:12,949
Please calm down

212
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:20,284
No one has any reason to worry,
each man's account be settled

213
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:26,462
You may proceed to the cash counters
and take your monies

214
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:32,960
lf need be, the bank will stay open
all night. Now calm down

215
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:38,701
Have you something to say ?

216
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,834
You've sold everything ?

217
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:49,046
Yes, everything.
l value a trust over money

218
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:55,049
l'll pay everyone back,
even if it takes my last cent

219
00:30:57,188 --> 00:31:02,717
l won't be called a cheat,
that l won't tolerate

220
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:05,129
At least you could've kept the house ?

221
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,056
No

222
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:16,602
For the time being, about a year,
l can live there. Afterwards...

223
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:21,407
afterwards,
if l still can't find the means,

224
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:26,684
then we've a property belonging
to Arati's mother in the suburbs

225
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:30,887
Some repairs might make it
habitable

226
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:45,898
Mr Chatterjee ! Oh what am l to do now ?

227
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:48,105
Why what happened ?
- l can't contact Dad

228
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:51,271
You know, there's a run on our bank.
- A run on your bank ? Why ?

229
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:54,602
Because of our business interests with
the Japanese. Japan has gone to war

230
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:58,777
People are scared, the government might
say it's enemy property and seal the bank

231
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:04,448
And knowing Dad, he won't rest until
he has repaid every cent he owes

232
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:09,556
Don't be worried, l'm going there.
l'll be with him until he returns

233
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:31,515
Dad...

234
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:35,853
Dad...

235
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:39,290
Nothing's left to think about

236
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:48,155
My life's work, all my dreams,
everything is shattered

237
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:54,504
Gone to waste,
so many years of hard work

238
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:03,510
Dad, let's not talk about all that.
Come, you should rest

239
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:26,863
l am very embarrassed. l have done
what Rathin would've done, if he was here

240
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:42,609
ln another lifetime,
we were surely related

241
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:49,785
l wouldn't know about other lifetimes,
but to me, you are like a relative

242
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:52,018
Arati...

243
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:54,291
Dad ! What happened, Dad ?

244
00:34:57,628 --> 00:34:59,755
Rathin is no more.
- He's no more ?

245
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:02,199
Died. ln London

246
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,105
What's this ? What happened ?

247
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:16,103
My brother is gone

248
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:19,316
We've no one now... no one !

249
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:22,648
Daddy ! Talk to me

250
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:37,662
Who... Mr Sen ?
l'm coming

251
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:03,351
How do you find him ?

252
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:06,362
Coronary thrombosis

253
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:10,697
Such a great shock
in a time of such mental distress

254
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:14,371
l can't say much before 12 hours

255
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:18,864
But, l don't seem to know you...?
- l am Probir Chatterjee

256
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:22,538
My brother's friend.
All of last night, he was by Dad's side

257
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:26,975
l'll see you in the evening

258
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:00,748
Ms Sen...

259
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:11,022
l cannot believe this...

260
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:17,428
this house is filled with
memories of my brother

261
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:24,434
l don't know what to do,
l'm at such a loss...

262
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:34,442
The act of balancing all accounts owed
to life was named death. Why grieve ?

263
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,286
How is he keeping ?
- A bit better, now

264
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:18,655
Thank God, l was so worried.
l picked a fight with my boss to get here

265
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,498
l've asked for a transfer.
l think it'll be given

266
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:24,230
l got to be back,
who else will look after you now ?

267
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:26,299
Let's look up your father

268
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:33,033
By the way, l don't think l know the
gentleman in the drawing room downstairs

269
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:34,977
He's Probir

270
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:50,853
Good day Mr Chatterjee,
l'm here to make an acquaintance

271
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:54,057
Good day.
- l've heard about you from Arati

272
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:57,125
ln this time of distress,
were it not for you...

273
00:38:57,368 --> 00:39:02,032
l only did what a gentleman would do
in a time like this

274
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:07,208
You are...?
- My name is Arun Bose

275
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:13,549
l'm close to this family in many ways,
in particular, as Arati's friend

276
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:18,088
Arati says, you've done
what even a closest relative would do

277
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:22,224
ln what words, do l speak my gratitude...
- Please don't speak about it

278
00:39:57,428 --> 00:40:02,593
Mr Chatterjee, if you don't mind,
how far away do you live ?

279
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:06,268
Quite far.
- Far ?

280
00:40:06,637 --> 00:40:08,935
Then you should be on your way
before nightfall

281
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:13,603
Black outs at night and thanks to
the tommies, there are just no taxis

282
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:19,614
But Ms Sen would...?
- l'll inform her, l'm staying

283
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:22,282
l'm not about to leave her,
in this time of distress

284
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:27,614
But problem is, Ms Sen seemed reassured
when l said, l'll stay for the night

285
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:30,026
So l thought, l'd rather ask...

286
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:58,054
What a fearsome noise...
- Yes, the tempest is rising

287
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:01,658
Could be a cyclone.
- Cyclone...?

288
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,729
This house is so old,
it might crumble...

289
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,997
Don't be afraid, Daddy,
l'm right beside you

290
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:13,666
Let me put you to sleep.
- Yes

291
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:25,343
He isn't coming...?

292
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:27,483
Who... Arun...?

293
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:34,185
No, that friend of Rathin's...?

294
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:37,693
Probir ?
- Yes, won't he come ?

295
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:40,696
How can he come, in this tempest ?

296
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:43,700
Yes, that's true

297
00:41:48,205 --> 00:41:51,038
lsn't that the telephone ringing ?
- l'll see

298
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,512
Hello Mr Arun, what news ?

299
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:02,718
Oh so you can't make it in this storm ?

300
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:05,312
That's fine

301
00:42:05,756 --> 00:42:07,519
Yes, l'll be careful

302
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:17,725
You managed to come ?
- So l have, how's daddy ?

303
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:20,402
Better.
- End of my worries

304
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:22,135
Take this

305
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,065
What's in it ?
- Recipe for tonight

306
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:27,009
What for ?
- Dinner

307
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:29,542
Dinner ?
- Goulash, tonight's for goulash

308
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,546
As if l wouldn't have given you goulash
if you hadn't brought these ?

309
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:36,746
The fishing, then the cooking
it's all the more fun

310
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:41,353
Shouldn't you get out of that outfit ?
- Yes, l'm drenched

311
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:47,753
Will my Dad's size fit you ?
- Might...

312
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,757
Try, come.
- Let's go

313
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:58,572
Some more ?
- You insist ? Well go on

314
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:02,310
l didn't know you're a bon vivant

315
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:07,774
All in good time, you know

316
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:13,120
Like this courage of ours,
the daring to face bullets...

317
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:17,785
who'd have imagined it
before August 1942 ?

318
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:29,404
You heard ? The front porch crashed ?
Now the rest of the house will crumble

319
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:33,470
No, you needn't be afraid,
that wasn't this house

320
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:39,339
You didn't hear that crash ?
- Must be a tin roof. You go to sleep

321
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:43,478
Are you sure ?
- l'm telling you, as an engineer

322
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:46,415
This kind of cyclone
cannot damage this house

323
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:48,051
l see...
- Go to sleep

324
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:50,160
All right.
- Lie down, Dad

325
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:53,830
God, won't this storm die down ?

326
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,841
You should eat your dinner
and take some rest

327
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:17,847
l'll stay here.
- But you've hardly eaten

328
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:20,849
Because l delight in food,
l am to eat it all ?

329
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:25,352
l've had my dinner. You go on.
- No, l'll stay here too

330
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:29,388
You need not. There's no point
in both of us staying awake

331
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,868
l'll awaken you at dawn

332
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:34,204
Go

333
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:58,481
Bye, l'll try to drop by in the evening.
- You're leaving us in great debt

334
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:03,949
Do you consider this to be a debt ?
l consider you to be close, l like you

335
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:07,761
ls that why you insist on being formal ?
- lsn't it mutual ?

336
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:10,625
Not at all. Today, l haven't
addressed you formally

337
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:13,970
ls that so ? You're one up on me ?

338
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:18,473
Or was l also getting at it ?
- l don't believe that

339
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:20,776
Trust me Arati,
it's what l came to tell you

340
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:25,971
Then why did you not say it ?
- Last night's storm, your dad's fears,

341
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:30,411
it all left me with mixed-up feelings.
- You ought to have spoken of it first

342
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:35,491
You are the giver, l am the taker.
- The taker is no less than the giver

343
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:40,657
ln receiving, the one who gives away,
ultimately triumphs over the giver

344
00:46:41,098 --> 00:46:43,066
Who can ever achieve that ?
- Seekers have been given

345
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:49,567
And they were given all of mankind,
like Buddha, like Christ

346
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,600
Grand denouement.
But l didn't want to hear this

347
00:47:00,384 --> 00:47:06,016
When the feeling of love is genuine,
the one who loves gives and takes,

348
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:09,882
but doesn't do the book-keeping.
What woman can take from man...

349
00:47:10,394 --> 00:47:14,160
and man can receive from woman,
is beyond measure

350
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:06,343
Coming

351
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,883
Letter for you

352
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:15,088
On His Majesty's Service ?

353
00:48:55,165 --> 00:48:57,133
When must you leave ?

354
00:48:58,235 --> 00:48:59,463
Tonight

355
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:08,945
When again do we meet ?

356
00:49:11,515 --> 00:49:16,748
Can't say for sure,
a soldier's life is uncertain

357
00:49:53,223 --> 00:49:58,855
Words of love are too inadequate
to explain my feelings

358
00:50:01,298 --> 00:50:08,761
So l won't put it to you in those words,
rather, l'll wait for you,

359
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:12,642
all my life

360
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,919
The siren sounded, he rushed out of bed
then he fell

361
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:14,703
No...

362
00:51:18,308 --> 00:51:20,276
this can never be

363
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,968
Chatterjee, why are you sitting alone ?

364
00:51:47,737 --> 00:51:48,965
What news ?

365
00:51:50,807 --> 00:51:54,470
l just got news,
during the Calcutta bombing...

366
00:51:54,678 --> 00:51:59,308
a relative of mine,
died of heart failure

367
00:51:59,749 --> 00:52:01,717
Was that so ?

368
00:52:03,353 --> 00:52:06,322
But what use grieving ?

369
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:09,659
Don't be sad, cheer up

370
00:52:16,366 --> 00:52:21,394
Arati, are you sitting here all alone ?

371
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:28,335
l'm not upto a conversation.
- Left to yourself, you'll be morose

372
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:38,353
l wish you'd cry your heart out.
Have you turned to stone ?

373
00:52:38,722 --> 00:52:42,556
Will you make her see reason,
none of us are to peace for her sake

374
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:47,561
Don't worry for me, l'm all right

375
00:52:49,399 --> 00:52:53,165
You've done so much for me,
in this time of my ordeals...

376
00:52:53,403 --> 00:52:56,930
what would l have done without you ?
- Not again. How could you imagine..

377
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:59,904
we wouldn't come to stand beside you
in your trying times ?

378
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:02,640
l've even taken
an extension of leave from work

379
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:11,084
Here's someone from the medical store,
he has a bill for 150 Rupees

380
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:17,118
Shall l ask him to come back later ?
- There's money in my drawer

381
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:19,388
l'll see

382
00:53:20,897 --> 00:53:23,388
Are we going home together ?
- Yes

383
00:53:35,145 --> 00:53:41,414
We'll be now. My father is sick,
he's suffering from arthritis

384
00:53:42,786 --> 00:53:44,811
Now please, don't be so morose

385
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:49,221
l told you, move in with us,
it won't be inconvenient at all

386
00:53:49,593 --> 00:53:52,960
But you keep refusing.
- l'm fine where l am

387
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:57,433
Fine. We'll leave now

388
00:53:58,134 --> 00:54:00,102
But don't you worry a bit

389
00:54:03,873 --> 00:54:05,431
Bye Arati

390
00:54:07,477 --> 00:54:09,502
The flowers you wanted

391
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:22,016
Probir, you've come !
Every moment l wished you'd be here

392
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:24,782
That's why l came to you

393
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:29,923
Excuse me...

394
00:55:31,561 --> 00:55:34,860
this letter arrived by yesterday's
evening post. l forgot to give it to you

395
00:55:48,378 --> 00:55:52,075
ln joyous anticipation,
l had opened your letter

396
00:55:52,816 --> 00:55:57,810
But news of your father's sudden demise
leaves me stunned, sad

397
00:55:58,888 --> 00:56:04,554
My heart urges me to fly to you,
but l am helpless, tied to martial law

398
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:11,128
My training done, now is my turn to be
on battlefields, l don't know where

399
00:56:13,002 --> 00:56:18,030
At 10:45am on Friday, be sure to come
to the enquiry counter at Howrah station

400
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:24,578
l'll seek out an opportunity
to meet you, come what may

401
00:56:26,616 --> 00:56:29,312
Before entering into the twilight zone
between life and death,

402
00:56:29,619 --> 00:56:31,587
l yearn to meet you, for once

403
00:56:32,322 --> 00:56:36,588
Make no mistake, 10.45am

404
00:56:38,027 --> 00:56:40,120
With love,
Probir

405
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:45,591
Let's go

406
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:48,063
Where ?
- Howrah station, where else ?

407
00:56:48,371 --> 00:56:50,601
You don't remember ?
My daddy didn't telephone ?

408
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:54,601
But...
- Come on, the car is waiting

409
00:56:55,011 --> 00:57:00,278
Will you tell him please, not to mind.
l got a very important appointment

410
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:04,347
But Daddy was hoping, he'd meet you.
- lf you may please reason with him...

411
00:57:04,654 --> 00:57:08,181
and tell him that l'll make sure
to come over for a holiday, very soon

412
00:57:08,658 --> 00:57:10,626
Very well, then...

413
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:17,031
Hi Arun, at this hour...?
- Yes, to see Arati

414
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:21,631
l see, so Arati is going out with you ?
Go, she's waiting upstairs for you

415
00:57:22,071 --> 00:57:24,631
Excuse me, l must go to Howrah station
- To Howrah station ?

416
00:57:24,908 --> 00:57:28,173
Yes, the doctor has advised my father
to take a change

417
00:57:28,678 --> 00:57:31,306
So l'm sending the whole family away
for a holiday

418
00:57:31,581 --> 00:57:33,048
See you.
- Bye

419
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:45,457
ls that Arun ? Come inside

420
00:57:51,701 --> 00:57:55,330
l tell you, today l am elated.
- For what reason ?

421
00:57:55,705 --> 00:57:58,674
Despite my repeated requests,
you steadfastly refused...

422
00:57:59,042 --> 00:58:01,670
to step outside these four walls.
What gives now, you're raring to go ?

423
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:05,345
l've an important appointment.
- Appointment ? When ?

424
00:58:05,715 --> 00:58:07,012
10.45am

425
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:11,119
Why are you leaving so soon ?
- l want to go shopping

426
00:58:11,721 --> 00:58:13,245
Very good ! Let's go

427
00:58:13,623 --> 00:58:16,683
You needn't take the trouble,
l can manage on my own

428
00:58:16,926 --> 00:58:19,258
No trouble at all, l got my car

429
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:22,359
l can even drop you wherever
your appointment is supposed to be

430
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:26,135
No thanks, you go on

431
00:58:26,736 --> 00:58:28,499
l'd rather not...

432
00:58:28,738 --> 00:58:30,035
Arati...

433
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:35,702
you disapprove spending even
the littlest moment in my company ?

434
00:58:38,648 --> 00:58:40,513
Very well, l'll leave

435
00:58:42,919 --> 00:58:44,216
Listen...

436
00:58:46,756 --> 00:58:52,319
lf it pleases you to go shopping with me
and dropping me for my appointment...

437
00:58:52,762 --> 00:58:56,163
then l'll take a lift in your car.
- Very well, come

438
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:06,539
You seem to be dressed
for some auspicious occassion

439
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:12,170
Auspicious, yes you may say so. A special
friend is to embark upon on a voyage

440
00:59:14,851 --> 00:59:16,751
The uncle is an excuse ?

441
00:59:32,135 --> 00:59:34,103
Why are you stopping here ?

442
00:59:34,804 --> 00:59:38,365
Let's take a break for tea.
- No time for tea, l'm getting late

443
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:01,529
l'm late, will you please drive fast ?
- Not to worry, l'll drop you on time

444
01:00:13,843 --> 01:00:16,539
Aren't you coming ?
- Yes, l'll join you

445
01:00:16,846 --> 01:00:18,814
Very little time left

446
01:00:32,862 --> 01:00:34,830
What happened ?
- l don't know,

447
01:00:35,031 --> 01:00:41,095
maybe engine trouble.
- What now... l've no time !

448
01:00:46,209 --> 01:00:47,904
Where are you going ?

449
01:00:50,913 --> 01:00:53,507
lf that isn't that you, Mr Chatterjee !
- Oh, is that you ?

450
01:00:53,883 --> 01:00:56,317
l came to see off my father.
- Has Arati come with you ?

451
01:00:56,552 --> 01:01:03,424
No. l went to her, but she was with Arun,
she said she can't come to the station

452
01:01:04,961 --> 01:01:06,861
She left with Mr Arun ?
- Yes

453
01:01:08,131 --> 01:01:10,395
She said she can't come to the station ?
- Right

454
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:16,531
Good day, Mr Chatterjee

455
01:02:43,659 --> 01:02:48,961
Arati, here's my final letter to you.
l wanted to see you at the station...

456
01:02:49,465 --> 01:02:53,128
notjust to bid you goodbye.
l had wished to tell you,

457
01:02:53,669 --> 01:02:55,637
before this farewell,
let's give each other,

458
01:02:56,005 --> 01:02:58,974
enough to last a lifetime. So that
even if we're lost to each other,

459
01:02:59,675 --> 01:03:03,634
we won't miss each other, ever.
But if l have failed,

460
01:03:04,514 --> 01:03:08,644
it's because you did not tell me
of your future commitment to Arun

461
01:03:09,485 --> 01:03:11,453
Why you chose not to tell me,
you know best

462
01:03:12,021 --> 01:03:16,424
ln hearing of it from your cousin,
all my pent-up enthusiasm has ebbed

463
01:03:18,094 --> 01:03:23,327
Now, it's all for the better.
l'm headed into war, fearless for life

464
01:03:53,229 --> 01:03:55,026
Why is it dark in here ?

465
01:03:56,065 --> 01:04:01,367
Arati, why are you so silent ?
Are you sick, do you have a headache ?

466
01:04:08,744 --> 01:04:12,043
What a shame Arati, you aren't a child,
don't be unreasonable

467
01:04:13,149 --> 01:04:15,845
What has happened, was inevitable,
it's all destiny

468
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:26,460
Sorrow invades every life,
then is erased. lsn't that natural ?

469
01:04:29,098 --> 01:04:34,058
For what crime of mine,
can l not be left alone even in my home ?

470
01:04:35,771 --> 01:04:39,571
Of course you may
and you may exclude everyone, except me

471
01:04:46,015 --> 01:04:47,073
Siren...

472
01:04:49,118 --> 01:04:51,086
Arati, the siren !
Come downstairs

473
01:04:51,988 --> 01:04:54,081
No.
- Don't be childish, come down

474
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:56,690
The bombing can begin anytime.
- l won't go

475
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:59,084
lf you're so afraid for your life,
you may leave

476
01:04:59,295 --> 01:05:01,422
No, l cannot and you know why l can't

477
01:05:02,765 --> 01:05:05,495
All right ! l'll sit here
and l don't care what happens

478
01:05:45,174 --> 01:05:49,133
ln pandering to your whims,
l'm also doing an injustice to myself

479
01:05:49,512 --> 01:05:52,140
We got to resolve this !
Now come downstairs

480
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:53,415
No !
- Yes !

481
01:05:53,582 --> 01:05:56,142
l'm not going !
- You must !

482
01:07:39,288 --> 01:07:42,257
We're about 25 miles
from enemy lines

483
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:49,254
Sir, the maintenance guy is here.
- l'm coming

484
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,503
Got the vehicle fixed ?

485
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:20,089
What's the trouble with it ?
- No trouble, sir, l've fixed it

486
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:23,296
Will to try it out, sir ?
- No, you drive it

487
01:08:24,867 --> 01:08:28,894
Name ?
- Ratneshwar Bhattacharji. Corporal, sir

488
01:08:35,344 --> 01:08:36,311
Move

489
01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:20,355
Who are you ?
- Corporal, sir

490
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:27,091
What is your name ?
- Ratneshwar Bhattacharji, mechanic

491
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:32,789
ls Captain Chatterjee your brother ?
- No

492
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:01,496
The Major has called you

493
01:10:48,477 --> 01:10:50,445
Corporal, you may leave

494
01:11:41,530 --> 01:11:44,499
l thought l'd like to know you better.
- Who, me sir ?

495
01:11:46,435 --> 01:11:52,067
You are a Bengali, l'm also a Bengali
and we look alike

496
01:11:54,543 --> 01:11:57,842
Poeple are saying, we're relatives.
- May l venture a remark, sir ?

497
01:11:58,647 --> 01:12:01,514
Yes, speak.
- You're a Brahmin, l'm a Brahmin too

498
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:04,386
Who knows, we may have common ancestors

499
01:12:08,357 --> 01:12:10,518
You were saying your prayers ?
- l'm from a family of priests

500
01:12:10,893 --> 01:12:17,264
At least once a day, l feel guilty
unless l've chanted a few lines a day

501
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:21,531
You know sir, my grandpa was a mystic.
He was said to have been enlightened

502
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:28,136
Once upon a time, our family was revered
but now, it's all gone. l went to school,

503
01:12:28,577 --> 01:12:32,604
but l couldn't pass school ;
l'm a motor mechanic for a livelihood

504
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:41,546
When l get the chance, l say a prayer to
the gods, and also to great souls...

505
01:12:41,924 --> 01:12:47,021
like, Ramakrishna Paramahansa,
Lord Chaitanya, Mahatma Gandhi, etc

506
01:12:50,599 --> 01:12:57,903
l can't say whether god exists, but
do put in a word for me when you pray,

507
01:12:59,608 --> 01:13:04,568
for l am forsaken by gods and mortals.
- What are you saying,

508
01:13:05,013 --> 01:13:11,179
man can forsake man, but God never
forsakes us. Who have you at home ?

509
01:13:13,622 --> 01:13:17,581
No one who matters much.
My parents died long ago

510
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:20,929
Are you married...
please don't mind that

511
01:13:22,631 --> 01:13:25,259
l won't, l haven't married

512
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:30,402
Very well done sir,
married men mustn't go to fight

513
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:33,598
Sometimes l worry,
should something happen to me...

514
01:13:34,009 --> 01:13:35,977
You're married ?

515
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:43,609
So what ?
Not everyone in a war ends up dead

516
01:13:44,653 --> 01:13:47,019
lf l am to die, my mother will go mad

517
01:13:48,157 --> 01:13:52,093
My mother can't see properly
and l'm her only son

518
01:13:53,662 --> 01:13:57,621
She just wouldn't let me enlist.
So finally, l said,

519
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,630
Ma, l'm going with your blessings,
l'll be back home without a scratch

520
01:14:03,672 --> 01:14:11,044
Then she said, all right, l swear
l'll perform penance till you return

521
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:18,415
And she chants the name of our goddess
3000 times a day

522
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:28,990
That's why l pray that
god saves my mother

523
01:14:36,705 --> 01:14:39,230
So Ratan,

524
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:43,877
in whose care have you left your Ma ?

525
01:14:45,647 --> 01:14:51,677
ln my wife's care. She's a good girl,
she hails from a good family. She said,

526
01:14:51,987 --> 01:14:54,683
don't worry for your Ma, just go on,
l'll take care of your mother

527
01:14:56,458 --> 01:15:01,225
You know what sir... no let it be

528
01:15:01,663 --> 01:15:03,961
No why let it be ? Go on, tell me

529
01:15:05,901 --> 01:15:14,707
l wish my wife had married someone rich.
With me, she lives in abject poverty

530
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:17,278
That's why l came to this war.
- What for ?

531
01:15:17,479 --> 01:15:20,380
To make it rich, so l can give
to my wife a queen's life

532
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:22,309
Look at her

533
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:27,155
This is my wife's photo

534
01:15:27,756 --> 01:15:30,725
Tell me sir, can so simple a dress
do justice to her beauty ?

535
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:42,727
But sir, when is this devastating war
going to end ?

536
01:15:43,772 --> 01:15:45,740
Ask your god

537
01:16:28,717 --> 01:16:31,117
l shall give my blood, my life

538
01:16:31,887 --> 01:16:35,789
You give me freedom,
give me the right to live in dignity

539
01:16:54,843 --> 01:17:01,806
How can you live in a house like this,
stacked to the rooftop with furniture ?

540
01:17:03,352 --> 01:17:07,812
Forget these olden ideas, this sentiment
about the ancestral homestead is dated

541
01:17:08,857 --> 01:17:11,985
Coem home to live with us,
your uncles aren't strangers to you

542
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:19,165
This house belonged to my mother

543
01:17:30,979 --> 01:17:32,640
What are you looking for ?

544
01:17:32,881 --> 01:17:34,576
l'll be back

545
01:18:06,915 --> 01:18:11,545
Silly girl, if there's a letter
addressed to you, it'll be delivered

546
01:18:13,488 --> 01:18:20,326
Don't lose hope, your wait won't go
unrewarded. Some day, he will return

547
01:19:23,658 --> 01:19:25,956
Get in, sir.
lnfantry attack under way

548
01:20:44,072 --> 01:20:48,031
Where did you pick up the major ?
- He's a braveheart,

549
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:53,309
got knocked out at the sound of bombs.
He was lying on the road. l picked him up

550
01:20:54,082 --> 01:20:57,051
After all, god made us all
and why waste a life after all ?

551
01:20:57,519 --> 01:20:59,487
Where are we headed ?

552
01:21:02,257 --> 01:21:06,591
l can't say for sure,
but yes, we're deserting

553
01:21:07,996 --> 01:21:13,730
What with the enemy surrounding us...
- The ones you call enemy...

554
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:18,563
are lNA soldiers,
they're coming to liberate us

555
01:21:21,243 --> 01:21:24,337
Goodness !
- What happened ?

556
01:21:31,052 --> 01:21:33,885
What's up ?
- Breakdown, Brakes not working

557
01:22:00,148 --> 01:22:04,107
Give me life, give me fame,

558
01:22:05,086 --> 01:22:06,849
give me fortune, give me sons,

559
01:22:07,155 --> 01:22:09,123
deign to grant all my desires

560
01:22:10,158 --> 01:22:12,126
O'goddess of life and death,

561
01:22:12,494 --> 01:22:14,462
in Thee l seek absolution,

562
01:22:14,763 --> 01:22:18,028
give unto me, the righteous life

563
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:18,183
America drops atom bombs on Japan.
Hiroshima, Nagasaki cities obliterated

564
01:23:20,562 --> 01:23:23,861
Second World War
comes to an end

565
01:23:25,567 --> 01:23:32,200
Congress leaders freed from prison.
Freedom struggle renewed

566
01:23:39,247 --> 01:23:41,545
Ratan, see me when you're done

567
01:24:17,685 --> 01:24:22,247
Jinnah demands Pakistan,
calls for Direct Action Day

568
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:31,262
August 16, 1946

569
01:24:37,305 --> 01:24:42,265
Ratan'da, l just got news.
There's a riot in the suburbs

570
01:24:42,677 --> 01:24:44,645
The rioters have attacked a house.
- Whose house ?

571
01:24:44,879 --> 01:24:46,938
The Sens at 5, Kapalitola Lane

572
01:24:48,316 --> 01:24:50,614
Hey, don't go there alone

573
01:25:20,281 --> 01:25:22,476
Where did the girl vanish ?
- Did she jump off the roof ?

574
01:25:22,684 --> 01:25:24,652
Forget her. Let's go

575
01:27:11,459 --> 01:27:13,427
Get a stretcher, quickly

576
01:27:40,822 --> 01:27:42,790
Straight to the doctor

577
01:27:45,159 --> 01:27:47,127
Where to now ?
- The slums

578
01:27:47,495 --> 01:27:49,861
lt's bad out there.
Don't go, l'm warning you

579
01:27:53,968 --> 01:27:59,031
Never saw this kind of daring.
- Soldier, doesn't care for his life

580
01:28:04,512 --> 01:28:07,481
Not what you feared. She wasn't raped

581
01:28:11,986 --> 01:28:13,954
l hope you're feeling better ?

582
01:28:21,462 --> 01:28:22,292
Yes

583
01:28:22,530 --> 01:28:26,830
That was a big mistake. You ought to
have left the house well in advance

584
01:28:29,771 --> 01:28:35,505
l never expected such a thing to happen.
- Thank god for your escape

585
01:28:36,544 --> 01:28:39,638
Do you have any relatives around ?

586
01:28:41,549 --> 01:28:43,517
Meaning, someone you may live with

587
01:28:45,486 --> 01:28:48,853
My uncle, in Ballygunge.
Can l find an escort ?

588
01:28:49,057 --> 01:28:52,515
Sure. Tomorrow morning,
Ratan will drop you

589
01:28:58,499 --> 01:29:01,195
Why the dark glasses ?

590
01:29:01,569 --> 01:29:05,335
Got ashes in my eyes last night.
My eyes are red from the exposure

591
01:29:06,674 --> 01:29:10,940
You got to drop last night's lady.
l needn't warn you, but mind your way

592
01:29:12,914 --> 01:29:14,211
Get in

593
01:29:15,917 --> 01:29:18,283
Don't be afraid,
he'll drop you safely

594
01:29:21,589 --> 01:29:23,284
Go on, get in

595
01:29:36,604 --> 01:29:39,573
Get the address right.
205/13, Ballygunge Circular Road

596
01:29:39,941 --> 01:29:42,375
205/13...?
- Right

597
01:30:18,546 --> 01:30:20,013
This house ?

598
01:30:20,648 --> 01:30:22,616
Now get off, l've more to do

599
01:30:38,733 --> 01:30:39,961
Who...?

600
01:30:41,669 --> 01:30:44,297
Arati, it's you... you've come !

601
01:30:44,672 --> 01:30:46,435
Thank god you're alive

602
01:30:47,008 --> 01:30:50,637
The last few days,
we've been so anxious... come in

603
01:30:51,012 --> 01:30:53,640
Listen, Arati has come

604
01:31:03,024 --> 01:31:06,653
Ms Arati, is that you...? Welcome
and sit down. Are you all right ?

605
01:31:07,695 --> 01:31:09,993
l'll disturb you a bit.
- What is the matter ?

606
01:31:12,700 --> 01:31:17,660
That Ratan, l mean the one...
- Yes, you wish to give him something ?

607
01:31:19,774 --> 01:31:21,435
lf only he will accept

608
01:31:21,642 --> 01:31:25,203
All your life,
you ought to be grateful to him

609
01:31:26,647 --> 01:31:30,014
l'm endlessly indebted.
- Let me find out

610
01:31:30,451 --> 01:31:33,215
Madhab...

611
01:31:35,756 --> 01:31:39,692
Madhab, where can Ratan be found ?
- Ratan'da ? Hard to say...

612
01:31:39,961 --> 01:31:43,021
he hasn't come around today.
But his wife might know

613
01:31:43,297 --> 01:31:45,094
Wife...?
- Yes,

614
01:31:45,366 --> 01:31:47,334
he has a wife and a blind mother at home

615
01:31:47,735 --> 01:31:49,703
Wife and blind mother...?

616
01:31:51,772 --> 01:31:55,299
What's the address ?
- Number 7, Baburam Lane

617
01:31:55,676 --> 01:31:59,703
Number 7, Baburam Lane ?
- l can escort you there, if you wish

618
01:32:00,748 --> 01:32:03,717
That won't be needed.
l'll find it myself

619
01:32:19,901 --> 01:32:21,869
Who are you looking for ?

620
01:32:23,804 --> 01:32:28,400
One Ratan... Mr Ratan lives here ?

621
01:32:28,776 --> 01:32:29,743
Yes

622
01:32:30,111 --> 01:32:34,741
ls he at home ?
- l'm not sure, but there was a tragedy

623
01:32:35,216 --> 01:32:42,281
Last night, his mother died. They may
have returned after cremating her. Wait,

624
01:32:42,590 --> 01:32:47,755
let me see... Ratan's wife...
O'Ratan's wife... is Ratan at home ?

625
01:33:03,811 --> 01:33:10,114
Don't grieve, she was lucky,
her son gave her the last rites

626
01:33:11,152 --> 01:33:14,588
Now look outside,
there's a lady looking for Ratan

627
01:33:50,257 --> 01:33:54,990
Please come inside and wait,
he should be coming anytime

628
01:33:57,965 --> 01:34:01,833
Where will you sit...
well, sit on the bed

629
01:34:03,871 --> 01:34:07,500
This must be your husband's photo ?
- You recognise him ?

630
01:34:14,882 --> 01:34:16,850
Your favourite flowers ?
- Yes

631
01:34:18,219 --> 01:34:22,178
Why worship the portrait of the living ?
- l also worship him that way

632
01:34:23,891 --> 01:34:25,859
l also do it with flowers

633
01:34:27,895 --> 01:34:29,863
Makes you smile ?

634
01:34:30,898 --> 01:34:36,268
l'm not a modern lady, but anyway, you
won't understand how it is between us

635
01:34:37,905 --> 01:34:45,141
Oh yes, l know, the husband is god.
- Knowing is not the same as believing

636
01:34:45,946 --> 01:34:49,780
Even amongst men, once in many ages
comes a man who is god-like

637
01:34:51,018 --> 01:34:55,978
When l was a child, l made a wish
for a ''god-like'' husband

638
01:34:57,024 --> 01:35:01,290
My father explained what ''god-like'' is...
- l'd like to hear that

639
01:35:02,863 --> 01:35:08,699
lt's a wish for men who are exceptional

640
01:35:10,538 --> 01:35:13,507
But not every woman is lucky
to find such exceptions

641
01:35:13,941 --> 01:35:21,905
And only exceptional women
can find those exceptional men

642
01:35:24,952 --> 01:35:27,921
For the rest of us,
it'll only remain an unfulfilled wish

643
01:35:29,056 --> 01:35:37,361
So, in the men who come into our lives,
we seek those exceptional qualities

644
01:35:38,966 --> 01:35:43,369
We wish to be exceptional,
but it's not easy to become it

645
01:35:45,306 --> 01:35:49,470
As for flowers and this worship
of gods and heroes...

646
01:35:50,311 --> 01:35:53,940
what's wrong if l worship my husband ?
- Nothing wrong at all

647
01:35:54,482 --> 01:35:56,609
But in our times, such devotion is rare

648
01:35:56,984 --> 01:36:00,545
Also rare in this age, is such love ;
maybe that's why you don't know...

649
01:36:00,988 --> 01:36:05,448
devotion, love are eternal themes,

650
01:36:06,327 --> 01:36:10,229
alive in my heart,
in yours, waiting to be found

651
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:16,560
l worship with flowers,
some worship in tears

652
01:36:18,005 --> 01:36:19,973
Your words are strange

653
01:36:20,341 --> 01:36:22,309
l am a strange sort

654
01:36:29,483 --> 01:36:31,314
What's your name ?

655
01:36:31,619 --> 01:36:32,779
Name ?

656
01:36:33,487 --> 01:36:35,455
Are you shy of telling your name ?

657
01:36:36,924 --> 01:36:43,989
He came home after the war
and he gave me a new name. Rati

658
01:36:48,469 --> 01:36:50,437
What happened, sister ?

659
01:36:54,041 --> 01:36:55,008
Nothing

660
01:36:57,311 --> 01:37:01,008
Excuse me, l should be leaving.
- Do visit us again

661
01:37:21,468 --> 01:37:24,096
Oh, so it's you...

662
01:37:27,074 --> 01:37:28,200
come

663
01:37:36,150 --> 01:37:37,515
Listen...

664
01:37:55,502 --> 01:37:57,470
What's happened, Rati ?

665
01:37:59,039 --> 01:38:00,063
Nothing

666
01:38:21,028 --> 01:38:22,427
Let's go

667
01:39:10,611 --> 01:39:11,942
Please sit

668
01:39:14,581 --> 01:39:17,141
You can be informal,
just say, sit

669
01:39:21,655 --> 01:39:25,147
Better to maintain the formality

670
01:39:30,264 --> 01:39:33,233
The choice is yours

671
01:39:35,469 --> 01:39:40,168
But why did you refuse to recognise me,
fear that your affair would be exposed ?

672
01:39:42,142 --> 01:39:45,168
Affair...?
- Not affair, grand affair

673
01:39:47,214 --> 01:39:50,183
On one hand, that sharing,
that give-and-take in life,

674
01:39:53,253 --> 01:39:55,687
and on the other...
l still possess your letter

675
01:40:01,328 --> 01:40:05,196
You had forgotten me,
now forget me completely

676
01:40:06,700 --> 01:40:11,603
Probir is dead.
- No, beyond death...

677
01:40:12,306 --> 01:40:16,208
you have returned, a ghost.
- Say what you wish, l won't mind

678
01:40:17,244 --> 01:40:22,204
Forget me, but what about them ?
Why did you deceive them ?

679
01:40:22,583 --> 01:40:26,542
And that girl, she's so devout,
why have you ruined her like this ?

680
01:40:26,820 --> 01:40:28,617
Out of lust

681
01:40:34,261 --> 01:40:36,229
You may imagine so

682
01:40:39,266 --> 01:40:42,895
And when her husband returns ?
- Her husband is never to return

683
01:40:44,271 --> 01:40:45,966
l saw him die

684
01:40:46,173 --> 01:40:52,635
You are so lowly, you're scum !
l'm going to expose you

685
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:57,915
You're tormenting yourself needlessly.
Sati knows everything

686
01:40:58,419 --> 01:41:04,688
She knows...? That means...
oh what have you done !

687
01:41:05,692 --> 01:41:07,990
You've forsaken everything,
even depraved yourself...

688
01:41:08,228 --> 01:41:11,254
for the sake of a pretty form ?
- The form, nonetheless, Ms Sen...

689
01:41:12,299 --> 01:41:17,794
is the embodiment of the divine.
- Don't mention my name, you're unworthy

690
01:41:18,305 --> 01:41:23,834
You're damned in perpetual sin !
- Unacceptable. Only God is my judge

691
01:41:26,713 --> 01:41:30,274
Never mind all that.
But would it seem so sinful if...

692
01:41:30,751 --> 01:41:35,950
Sati were to enter viduage first and
thereafter, if l were to marry her...?

693
01:41:36,323 --> 01:41:38,291
Which is what you did not !
- Which is because,

694
01:41:38,492 --> 01:41:41,290
we share no physical relationship.
- You expect me to believe that ?

695
01:41:41,528 --> 01:41:46,295
You have seen where we live,
how we live and there, have you seen...

696
01:41:46,533 --> 01:41:53,302
any scope or sign of debauchery ?
You may have seen the lone bed ?

697
01:41:54,341 --> 01:41:59,301
Ms Sen, l know our times and l have
witnessed the limits of our modernism,

698
01:42:00,247 --> 01:42:02,977
in clubs, hotels, l have seen
the most loyal, modern couples...

699
01:42:03,350 --> 01:42:06,979
and l have seen their divorces ;
in comparison, we are saintly,

700
01:42:07,354 --> 01:42:10,323
we're happier, more at peace,
more reconciled to life

701
01:42:11,291 --> 01:42:14,988
l see in Sati a goddess,
she too is devoted to me

702
01:42:15,362 --> 01:42:17,330
Wait, l'm not finished

703
01:42:18,365 --> 01:42:22,324
ln battle, l come across Ratan,
a motor mechanic attached to my unit,

704
01:42:22,903 --> 01:42:28,341
and we're look-alikes.
Then we're retreating, hiding in jungles

705
01:42:28,709 --> 01:42:32,076
And Ratan is wounded, it's a bad wound

706
01:43:11,018 --> 01:43:12,645
Have no fear,

707
01:43:12,886 --> 01:43:15,787
nothing to fear,
the shrapnel has pierced your arm

708
01:44:06,473 --> 01:44:10,239
O'mother... mother

709
01:44:41,508 --> 01:44:42,736
Sir...

710
01:44:43,744 --> 01:44:44,711
Yes ?

711
01:44:44,845 --> 01:44:52,809
How will we find our way back, sir ?
Here we are, in unknown jungles...

712
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:55,015
Be firm

713
01:44:55,522 --> 01:44:57,490
Don't break down

714
01:45:04,231 --> 01:45:08,497
Unbearable pain,
l think my body is becoming septic

715
01:45:10,570 --> 01:45:12,936
l don't think...

716
01:45:14,541 --> 01:45:16,509
l don't think l'll survive

717
01:45:17,544 --> 01:45:19,512
l know sir, l won't live

718
01:45:21,615 --> 01:45:24,516
Ratan ! What's going on ?
Why are you acting like this ?

719
01:45:24,918 --> 01:45:27,910
l can't bear it, sir... l can't

720
01:45:28,355 --> 01:45:30,186
Oh, what pain

721
01:45:38,498 --> 01:45:40,329
My mother said,

722
01:45:40,567 --> 01:45:45,527
''Ratan, don't go. You'll suffer.
Greed leads to sin, sin leads to...''

723
01:45:47,007 --> 01:45:49,532
''l've borne the loss of
your father's death, but if you die...''

724
01:45:56,650 --> 01:45:59,084
Before our wedding, her name was Sita

725
01:46:00,587 --> 01:46:04,353
lt's said that if girls are named Sita,
they suffer all their lives. So...

726
01:46:04,591 --> 01:46:06,559
l changed her name to Sati

727
01:46:07,894 --> 01:46:10,886
Sir, you go ahead

728
01:46:12,399 --> 01:46:15,562
lf you can go to them, at least
they will get some news

729
01:46:17,671 --> 01:46:21,004
l won't survive.
- Stop worrying like this

730
01:46:23,710 --> 01:46:31,583
They're the ones who'll be left to worry,
if l die, they will become destitutes

731
01:46:31,852 --> 01:46:33,581
Ratan please,

732
01:46:33,954 --> 01:46:35,922
be quiet

733
01:46:39,659 --> 01:46:44,119
Give me a promise, please.
After l'm dead...

734
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:51,127
you'll inform my mother and wife
... yes sir ?

735
01:46:53,974 --> 01:46:55,942
Give me your word, sir

736
01:46:57,978 --> 01:46:59,605
Say it

737
01:47:07,687 --> 01:47:13,057
Ratan, you have my word,
if l'm the one to be left alive,

738
01:47:14,161 --> 01:47:16,629
l'll make sure to inform
your mother and sister

739
01:47:17,764 --> 01:47:24,226
And l'll also see to it
that they do not suffer in any way

740
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:35,748
May God bless you

741
01:47:38,084 --> 01:47:40,052
May God preserve you, sir

742
01:48:09,749 --> 01:48:12,115
Water... water...

743
01:48:18,725 --> 01:48:20,693
Ratan, take a drink

744
01:50:10,837 --> 01:50:13,328
Over here... this is the house

745
01:50:14,841 --> 01:50:17,401
Ratan's mother and wife
left for Kolkata long ago

746
01:50:19,846 --> 01:50:21,609
They left for Kolkata ?
- Yes

747
01:50:21,915 --> 01:50:25,351
Can you give me the Kolkata address ?
- l haven't any address

748
01:50:29,856 --> 01:50:35,158
When is the next return train ?
- Return train ? Tomorrow morning

749
01:50:36,796 --> 01:50:38,229
Goodbye

750
01:50:48,208 --> 01:50:50,176
Put my luggage down

751
01:50:50,877 --> 01:50:58,841
Ratan died, then l was discharged from
the army. lt was a long return journey,

752
01:51:00,954 --> 01:51:05,186
and l was in two minds. Till today
l can't forget Ratan's last words,

753
01:51:06,359 --> 01:51:13,856
''My mother, my wife''
Finding them was my prime duty

754
01:51:15,335 --> 01:51:22,537
And here l was, in an obscure village
far from Kolkata, only to be told...

755
01:51:22,909 --> 01:51:31,317
driven by want, Ratan's mother and
his wife had migrated to the city

756
01:51:32,919 --> 01:51:40,416
No way, l could've returned that night,
so l took shelter in Ratan's house

757
01:51:50,937 --> 01:51:55,237
Give me a promise, please.
After l'm dead...

758
01:51:56,943 --> 01:51:58,911
you'll inform my mother and wife

759
01:52:01,948 --> 01:52:03,415
Say it

760
01:52:05,285 --> 01:52:07,253
Give me your word, sir

761
01:52:32,078 --> 01:52:36,037
l had no option but to accept
my misfortune

762
01:52:42,989 --> 01:52:47,949
l returned to Kolkata,
but l didn't visit you, for good reason

763
01:52:48,995 --> 01:52:56,959
ln my awareness about your relationship
with Arun, my conscience was forbidding,

764
01:52:58,004 --> 01:53:05,570
neither you nor l had anything to cherish,
so in that state of indecision,

765
01:53:06,012 --> 01:53:12,645
l went about looking for Ratan's mother.
Tired and defeated, one afternoon,

766
01:53:13,019 --> 01:53:17,979
l ambled along the riviera, pausing,
in idle curiosity, to watch a crowd

767
01:53:20,026 --> 01:53:21,493
And suddenly...

768
01:53:38,144 --> 01:53:41,011
Where are you gone, my child ?

769
01:53:43,049 --> 01:53:44,812
Come with me !
- Have you bought the flowers ?

770
01:53:45,051 --> 01:53:47,679
First, the fruit.
- What are you saying ?

771
01:53:48,054 --> 01:53:50,682
Come... here's your son.
- Son...?

772
01:53:51,057 --> 01:53:53,617
And here's your Ma.
- My son... Ratan !

773
01:53:54,060 --> 01:54:02,365
My Ratan ! God, for one look at my son,
give me back my sight !

774
01:54:03,403 --> 01:54:06,702
Eight years it has been and there was
no news and everyone said, you were dead

775
01:54:07,140 --> 01:54:09,438
But l knew, you'd return !
- But l'm not...

776
01:54:09,742 --> 01:54:14,645
What son are you, can't you once,
utter the word Ma. She's blind,

777
01:54:15,081 --> 01:54:18,710
just a word will soothe her heart,
after so many years...

778
01:54:18,952 --> 01:54:26,051
Yes, he'd return ! l knew he'd return,
look at him, l said, my Ratan would come

779
01:54:26,459 --> 01:54:32,056
Now l will hear him call me mother,
Ratan, oh my Ratan

780
01:54:35,134 --> 01:54:37,602
Go on, call her Ma

781
01:54:42,141 --> 01:54:44,405
Ma, l am...

782
01:54:44,644 --> 01:54:50,082
There ! God be praised !
- God be praised !

783
01:54:52,118 --> 01:54:58,853
Thank you God,
but l have nothing to offer You

784
01:55:05,531 --> 01:55:10,696
My poor dear, oh how you must've
suffered... but l've lost my eyes

785
01:55:11,004 --> 01:55:14,701
Oh how l wish l could see you...
- Your son has become stern ?

786
01:55:15,141 --> 01:55:22,638
Let him be, at least he's back home.
- ln hope that one day, you'd return,

787
01:55:23,182 --> 01:55:28,586
l've clung on to life, now l all wish
is to leave your wife in your care

788
01:56:36,222 --> 01:56:39,623
Who... who are you ?
You aren't him

789
01:56:45,264 --> 01:56:47,892
Forgive me, l've wronged you no end

790
01:56:49,235 --> 01:56:52,534
Believe me, l never had a chance

791
01:56:58,244 --> 01:57:03,739
Yes, we never gave you a chance.
l'd never know without a close look,

792
01:57:05,318 --> 01:57:10,950
the similarity is so striking.
- Your husband said that too,

793
01:57:12,658 --> 01:57:19,222
we must've had a common ancestor,
after all, we belong to the same caste

794
01:57:20,199 --> 01:57:21,962
Then you are...?

795
01:57:22,268 --> 01:57:25,965
Probir Chatterjee.
- He wrote about you, in a letter

796
01:57:32,278 --> 01:57:33,506
l...

797
01:57:38,284 --> 01:57:40,582
l was bringing to you,
news of your husband

798
01:57:41,287 --> 01:57:43,255
Then l know what news it is

799
01:57:45,224 --> 01:57:49,490
But now, l'm cast into a life of lies

800
01:58:38,811 --> 01:58:42,178
l think l should leave.
Any longer and...

801
01:58:51,257 --> 01:58:53,316
ls that you, Ratan ? Ratan...?

802
01:58:53,793 --> 01:58:57,854
Sati, see who's leaving.
- Your son

803
01:58:58,364 --> 01:59:01,925
Ratan, that's you Ratan ?
Where are you going, so late at night ?

804
01:59:02,502 --> 01:59:07,769
He came out to see if you've slept.
- Ratan's Ma, are you gone senile ?

805
01:59:08,374 --> 01:59:12,003
How can your son's wife go to bed
when the mother-in-law is sitting out ?

806
01:59:12,311 --> 01:59:16,680
Come, you can sleep in my room.
- Oh how true, how could l miss it ?

807
01:59:17,049 --> 01:59:22,351
All right, l'll sleep in your room.
- Don't worry for her, Sati

808
01:59:43,476 --> 01:59:45,376
You may not leave

809
01:59:46,412 --> 01:59:49,904
Why...?
- Tomorrow when it's made public,

810
01:59:51,417 --> 01:59:57,822
that the man l brought home tonight
wasn't my husband, what shall l say ?

811
01:59:59,892 --> 02:00:05,728
Then l won't have another chance.
- You can go away tomorrow

812
02:00:08,668 --> 02:00:16,939
And l'll drown myself in the river
to absolve myself of suicide's sin

813
02:00:19,545 --> 02:00:23,072
And to abet it, let's stage
a screaming match. Then...

814
02:00:23,449 --> 02:00:30,753
no questions will arise,
out of your leaving or my suicide

815
02:00:34,360 --> 02:00:37,158
But this old woman...?
Oh God...

816
02:00:40,900 --> 02:00:45,428
You tell me Lord,
what am l to do now ?

817
02:01:58,811 --> 02:02:00,005
Who...?

818
02:02:01,881 --> 02:02:03,178
Ratan...?

819
02:02:06,552 --> 02:02:12,787
No, this cannot be,
this can never be

820
02:02:14,960 --> 02:02:16,188
lmpossible

821
02:02:22,001 --> 02:02:24,868
Open the door

822
02:02:25,705 --> 02:02:28,538
Open up, please

823
02:03:22,661 --> 02:03:27,598
Swollen eyes ? Did you hide your face
in his bosom and weep all night ?

824
02:03:29,368 --> 02:03:32,030
Even odes to sorrow
sung in joyous turns, sound sweet

825
02:03:34,573 --> 02:03:37,599
Ma, l'm taking your son
for a bath in holy Ganges

826
02:03:38,377 --> 02:03:42,871
Then we'll go to the temple.
- Yes, you must go together

827
02:03:43,449 --> 02:03:48,182
l'd be a bother, so you go along,
the two of you, together

828
02:04:06,772 --> 02:04:08,171
Let's go

829
02:04:12,678 --> 02:04:13,804
Come

830
02:04:14,680 --> 02:04:17,979
Any later and there'll be
a crowd of bathers, come

831
02:04:38,737 --> 02:04:42,002
No, l can't let this happen...

832
02:04:43,709 --> 02:04:44,676
What ?

833
02:04:46,712 --> 02:04:49,010
l can't be responsible
for your death

834
02:04:50,716 --> 02:04:54,675
Have no fear,
l'm not about to die right now

835
02:04:56,121 --> 02:04:58,282
First, l must hear everything
from you

836
02:04:59,892 --> 02:05:03,692
Can't do that at home,
the old woman is waiting to hear

837
02:05:04,730 --> 02:05:09,167
Let's sit by the Ganges, come

838
02:09:10,976 --> 02:09:12,944
So now you've heard,

839
02:09:13,378 --> 02:09:16,438
about our lives,
Ratan's and mine

840
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:23,751
Let's go now

841
02:09:39,004 --> 02:09:40,471
What happened ?

842
02:09:55,120 --> 02:09:56,985
What's on your mind ?

843
02:09:58,090 --> 02:10:05,997
At this moment, l could drown myself,
but the old woman is my responsibility

844
02:10:09,268 --> 02:10:14,001
And how can l ask you to take
the burden that's mine...?

845
02:10:15,374 --> 02:10:17,672
But you know, l must leave.
- No !

846
02:10:19,044 --> 02:10:24,505
ln your wake, she will go mad.
Last night, you saw how it is

847
02:10:27,052 --> 02:10:30,818
And to tell you the truth,
l can't bear this any longer

848
02:10:31,056 --> 02:10:33,024
But what can l do ?

849
02:10:36,128 --> 02:10:41,691
For a few days, just stay on...
- You are making a mistake

850
02:10:42,067 --> 02:10:46,367
With me around, you must behave like,
dress like, live like a married woman

851
02:10:49,174 --> 02:10:50,539
l know

852
02:10:54,213 --> 02:10:58,047
lf l put up this facade,
it will be no sin

853
02:10:59,885 --> 02:11:02,376
Even in my husband's death,
l cannot become a widow

854
02:11:03,889 --> 02:11:06,483
What do you mean ?
- lt's was a secret

855
02:11:08,093 --> 02:11:14,794
My horoscope showed early widowhood.
So my father wedded me to an idol,

856
02:11:16,435 --> 02:11:20,633
and he said, l can't give you away
to any mortal. So l give you to...

857
02:11:20,839 --> 02:11:25,071
the One who is Eternal. Never
in your life, you'll become a widow

858
02:11:27,112 --> 02:11:33,415
And in the man you will
some day marry, seek Him

859
02:11:35,120 --> 02:11:39,079
Only He can save you. Else...

860
02:11:46,465 --> 02:11:51,869
Why don't you just live with us ?
- Pretending to be Ratan ?

861
02:11:52,204 --> 02:11:58,632
Yes, only as long as the old woman lives,
let's only bide our time, like last night

862
02:12:02,147 --> 02:12:06,379
Oh, you look so familiar to me,

863
02:12:08,153 --> 02:12:12,180
it must be a bond beyond lifetimes

864
02:12:15,594 --> 02:12:18,791
To me he was God

865
02:12:20,165 --> 02:12:22,133
You are His reflection

866
02:12:28,173 --> 02:12:31,574
l have heard it said how sometimes,
to please the ardent devotee...

867
02:12:32,177 --> 02:12:40,016
God appears, in human likeness ;
He smiles, converses, even teases,

868
02:12:41,086 --> 02:12:46,683
but touch Him, you may not.
Come unto us in that likeness,

869
02:12:47,659 --> 02:12:52,824
to become one amongst us, save us
and we shall also belong to you,

870
02:12:55,334 --> 02:13:00,829
in all except the physical self,
we shall relate to each other

871
02:13:04,276 --> 02:13:08,178
You who has come unto our world,
now becomes our God, to this one,

872
02:13:09,581 --> 02:13:14,177
who has no son, become as son,
and be husband to one who has none

873
02:13:15,220 --> 02:13:19,623
Once human, now arise, become God,
can you not...?

874
02:13:21,093 --> 02:13:24,187
But are you aware of your youth ?
- l'm here only to behold

875
02:13:25,130 --> 02:13:29,191
But l am of flesh, human.
What if l fail to pretend ?

876
02:13:29,601 --> 02:13:34,197
You are aware, as l am,
how Arati stands between us

877
02:13:34,406 --> 02:13:38,934
Despite...?
- No, you will succeed. l shall help you

878
02:13:41,146 --> 02:13:43,740
You trust me so far ?
- l trust you more

879
02:13:44,516 --> 02:13:46,484
Come, let's bathe in the sacred waters

880
02:13:53,258 --> 02:14:01,563
So be it, unto the Ganges l shall
yield my self, my belief, my custom

881
02:14:02,901 --> 02:14:06,564
Then let me see,
if l can become Ratan

882
02:14:19,951 --> 02:14:26,254
ln those first hours, l failed to
denounce her, to speak of her fallacies

883
02:14:28,560 --> 02:14:32,758
And in inseparable ties of trust,
love and affection, l entwined myself

884
02:14:35,300 --> 02:14:37,268
To her entreaties, l submitted

885
02:14:43,842 --> 02:14:48,745
Now where is my wrongdoing,
my crime my sin, my deception ?

886
02:14:51,316 --> 02:14:52,681
Forgive me

887
02:14:53,785 --> 02:14:58,279
Please forgive me Probir,
l've gotten you wrong

888
02:14:59,925 --> 02:15:03,622
But for once, say,
what am l to do now ?

889
02:15:05,397 --> 02:15:12,303
lf only you knew how l bided my time,
my father, brother, all gone...

890
02:15:13,839 --> 02:15:16,307
oh how l pined to find you near me

891
02:16:28,079 --> 02:16:31,913
Have you finished the conversation ?
l waited and waited and then l came

892
02:16:33,418 --> 02:16:37,548
Listen, a man has come to see you,
he has a letter for you

893
02:16:38,290 --> 02:16:41,384
He said, it's urgent,
l told him to wait for you

894
02:16:43,762 --> 02:16:45,730
l should go

895
02:16:47,866 --> 02:16:49,834
Go on, l'll give her company

896
02:17:03,315 --> 02:17:05,408
l know all about you, Arati

897
02:17:07,385 --> 02:17:09,410
And now you've heard it all

898
02:17:10,255 --> 02:17:13,850
l knew, he'd conceal nothing

899
02:17:15,560 --> 02:17:18,825
l hope you realise
that l am not in your place

900
02:17:20,465 --> 02:17:22,433
l am only me

901
02:17:29,474 --> 02:17:36,004
l dangled between luck and love,
then l lucked out,

902
02:17:37,816 --> 02:17:40,182
your lot is love

903
02:17:42,654 --> 02:17:47,614
To him, l am a catastrophe,
you are his solace

904
02:17:56,501 --> 02:17:58,799
Can you not take Probir down...

905
02:18:03,508 --> 02:18:06,136
from the pedestal
where you've put him ?

906
02:18:06,444 --> 02:18:13,043
l can. After my bath,
l'll take him down from the altar

907
02:18:15,520 --> 02:18:19,479
l should be going, it's time...

908
02:18:55,560 --> 02:19:00,520
You are the reflection of my God
and l have been greatly blessed

909
02:19:01,566 --> 02:19:06,526
No blemish, no blame, no fault
is yours

910
02:19:07,572 --> 02:19:12,737
Not of your own wish,
you were sent to me by the god of love

911
02:19:14,279 --> 02:19:20,548
Life's trials even gods must suffer if
they are cursed to live in mortal realm

912
02:19:21,319 --> 02:19:25,278
And joyless they live, until they have
bided their time, then to return...

913
02:19:25,590 --> 02:19:30,550
to their heavens. For the sake of
those heavens, you performed penance,

914
02:19:31,596 --> 02:19:35,555
in being son to a bereaved mother,
being husband to a destitute widow...

915
02:19:36,401 --> 02:19:41,964
you have succeeded in this extreme
of tests. But my time has come...

916
02:19:42,607 --> 02:19:50,742
to leave your protection.
ln no more entreaties, l can bind you

917
02:19:52,150 --> 02:19:57,747
Unless l give up my physical being,
Arati's penance will not bear fruit

918
02:19:58,957 --> 02:20:04,020
Now make good for her
the long tearful wait that was hers

919
02:20:04,729 --> 02:20:10,964
l shall survive within
the woman you love most

920
02:21:17,368 --> 02:21:19,666
Where did Sati go ?
- l didn't understand,

921
02:21:20,138 --> 02:21:22,470
she was speaking strange words,
then she walked away

922
02:21:22,774 --> 02:21:24,674
Which way...?
- That way

923
02:21:26,044 --> 02:21:27,341
What happened ?

924
02:21:27,812 --> 02:21:29,109
Read it
