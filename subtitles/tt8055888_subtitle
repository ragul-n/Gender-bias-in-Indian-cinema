1
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:33,750
<i>Behind every mind-blowing story...</i>

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,125
<i>...are some pretty bad decisions.</i>

3
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:40,417
<i>I must have heard grandpa say this.</i>

4
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,833
<i>He keeps saying these things.</i>

5
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:46,000
<i>I guess this is how it looks from there.</i>

6
00:00:48,292 --> 00:00:49,625
<i>And from here...</i>

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,167
<i>Look at all of them charging towards me.</i>

8
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:57,658
<i>If I turn around and start
running in the same direction...</i>

9
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:01,292
<i>they would not even realize
that they were charging towards me.</i>

10
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,417
<i>I don't understand why the hurry.</i>

11
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:07,417
<i>I am right here.</i>

12
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:12,025
<i>What if someone trips and fall?</i>

13
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,958
<i>This was bound to happen</i>

14
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:18,042
<i>Let's begin.</i>

15
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:23,333
<i>Break it...</i>

16
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:26,958
<i>Break it...</i>

17
00:01:27,042 --> 00:01:29,583
<i>Break a leg, an arm, a jaw Break a head</i>

18
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:30,792
<i>Break it</i>

19
00:01:31,167 --> 00:01:33,000
<i>I feel no pain</i>

20
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:35,125
<i>Haven't I told you this?</i>

21
00:01:35,792 --> 00:01:37,417
<i>I feel no pain</i>

22
00:01:45,667 --> 00:01:47,167
<i>Break it...</i>

23
00:01:48,042 --> 00:01:49,458
<i>Shatter it...</i>

24
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:51,625
<i>Break it...</i>

25
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:54,250
<i>Shatter it...</i>

26
00:01:58,667 --> 00:01:59,917
<i>Surya...</i>

27
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,417
<i>you should keep drinking water.</i>

28
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:04,082
<i>Otherwise...</i>

29
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:05,500
<i>I may get dehydrated.</i>

30
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:08,333
<i>And if you get dehydrated?</i>

31
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:10,750
<i>Easy, Surya. Easy.</i>

32
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:15,292
<i>Break it...</i>

33
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:20,167
<i>Break it...</i>

34
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,750
<i>Haven't I told you this?</i>

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,083
<i>I feel no pain</i>

36
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,458
<i>I wanted a normal child.</i>

37
00:02:34,542 --> 00:02:36,042
<i>Why did you come back?</i>

38
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:38,333
<i>You must train very hard.</i>

39
00:02:38,417 --> 00:02:40,792
<i>One day you'll become the Karate Man.</i>

40
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,333
<i>The Destroyer of Evil!</i>

41
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:44,208
<i>Life recap.</i>

42
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:47,125
<i>Oh shit! I am dying.</i>

43
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,542
<i>I am dying of dehydration.</i>

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,833
<i>I shouldn't have stopped drinking water.</i>

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,708
<i>But why is my brain
replaying incidents of my life...</i>

46
00:02:59,167 --> 00:03:01,583
<i>like some crappy 90's music video.</i>

47
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,167
<i>They can do better.</i>

48
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:06,208
<i>And from the very beginning.</i>

49
00:03:09,167 --> 00:03:12,250
I FEEL NO PAIN

50
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,458
<i>It's a challenge</i>

51
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:21,417
<i>It's a challenge</i>

52
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,583
<i>What place is this?</i>

53
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:25,917
<i>I've never been here.</i>

54
00:03:26,792 --> 00:03:28,417
<i>This boy isn't me.</i>

55
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,250
<i>Mom!</i>

56
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,125
<i>Dad!</i>

57
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,292
<i>Grandpa!</i>

58
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:40,292
<i>And me? Oh! I am not born yet.</i>

59
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:42,917
- Want to go to the hospital?
- Samosa.

60
00:03:43,167 --> 00:03:44,375
Samosa.

61
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,700
- Shall I get it during the intermission?
- Right now.

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,333
Since you're going, get me egg patties.

63
00:03:52,042 --> 00:03:53,500
Should I miss the movie?

64
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,375
I'll tell you the story later.

65
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,500
- And Sosyo.
- Sosyo?

66
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,208
For me too.

67
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,000
Before the movie started, I'd asked
you people if you want something.

68
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,942
- Why didn't you speak up then?
- Shut up, man!

69
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:07,083
Sorry. Sorry.

70
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,048
Sorry for the inconvenience. Sorry.

71
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:12,792
Hey... Get lost...

72
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:13,917
You shut up.

73
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,333
<i>I am not going to spare anyone</i>

74
00:04:16,417 --> 00:04:20,208
<i>I will break everyone's pride</i>

75
00:04:20,292 --> 00:04:22,583
- Hey...
- It's alright, she will handle it.

76
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:24,167
<i>I am not going to spare anyone</i>

77
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,208
<i>It's a challenge</i>

78
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,000
<i>It's a challenge</i>

79
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,583
<i>I think that was too dramatic.</i>

80
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,033
<i>That's not how it happened.</i>

81
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,500
<i>Fine, no cheating in the flashback.</i>

82
00:04:43,542 --> 00:04:46,833
<i>I will break everyone's pride</i>

83
00:04:46,917 --> 00:04:47,870
<i>It's a challenge</i>

84
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:50,125
- Hey...
- It's alright, she will handle it.

85
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,625
<i>It's a challenge</i>

86
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,917
<i>How dare you abuse my mother?</i>

87
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,583
<i>Stay there, here I come!</i>

88
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,583
- Sosyo?
- Hospital!

89
00:05:07,667 --> 00:05:09,208
Turn on the lights!

90
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:16,667
<i>A Terminator was sent
from the future to kill me.</i>

91
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,361
<i>Because in the future
when the machines take over...</i>

92
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:22,917
<i>I am the one who saves the world.</i>

93
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,250
<i>Well, my mom terminated the Terminator.</i>

94
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:35,700
<i>It should've been like this.
Sorry, this never happened either.</i>

95
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:46,000
<i>I'm going to sing my song</i>

96
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:50,042
<i>Make the whole world listen</i>

97
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:54,083
<i>I am going to cast my spell</i>

98
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,833
<i>Make everyone dance to my tunes</i>

99
00:05:58,417 --> 00:06:01,750
<i>Wherever I go...</i>

100
00:06:02,292 --> 00:06:06,083
<i>I spread my zest everywhere</i>

101
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:10,042
<i>Wherever I go...</i>

102
00:06:10,542 --> 00:06:14,125
<i>I spread my zest everywhere</i>

103
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:18,292
<i>Whoever dares to challenge me</i>

104
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:21,042
<i>Won't live to the day</i>

105
00:06:21,167 --> 00:06:23,125
<i>And then we all lived happily ever after</i>

106
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,375
<i>It's a challenge</i>

107
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,125
Leave it. Let go.

108
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,417
Hey...

109
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,292
- Leave it.
- What are you doing?

110
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:33,583
Leave it.

111
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,458
- Leave it.
- Hurry up, Jimmy.

112
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,500
- Let go.
- Hurry up.

113
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,333
- Father!
- Father!

114
00:06:40,417 --> 00:06:41,625
Pull it Jimmy, quickly.

115
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:48,708
- Hurry up. Hurry up.
- Leave it. Let go.

116
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,375
<i>I wish I could say this never happened.</i>

117
00:07:33,167 --> 00:07:34,708
<i>But this is how it happened.</i>

118
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:38,792
<i>In the next few years, the city
witnessed riots and bomb blasts.</i>

119
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,250
<i>And everyone forgot about
those petty chain-snatchers.</i>

120
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,250
No, sir. I am not sleeping.
My son is sleeping.

121
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,167
That's why I am talking slowly. Okay.

122
00:07:46,292 --> 00:07:48,125
I'll be there on time. Okay, bye.

123
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:15,333
<i>Hands and legs tied up,
and goggles on my face.</i>

124
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:17,333
<i>Why?</i>

125
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,167
<i>Well, I can explain, why?</i>

126
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:23,125
<i>But it does sound better
when a doctor explains it.</i>

127
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:28,625
See, most kids don't
even survive post four years

128
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,875
with Congenital Insensitivity to Pain.

129
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:32,625
It's a medical miracle.

130
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:33,917
He's alive.

131
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,167
<i>It's a rare medical condition.
You can Google it later.</i>

132
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,083
You people should be looking happy.

133
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,167
Grandpa!

134
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:53,292
Doctor, I wanted a normal child.

135
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,625
But I got this Mowgli instead?

136
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,000
Leave that alone.

137
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,708
Does he call you Bagheera?

138
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:00,625
Then why do you call him Mowgli?

139
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:03,000
See doctor.

140
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,042
My father-in-law.

141
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,917
He's spoiling my kid by
getting him addicted to movies.

142
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,458
It's important to explain it to
him, the meaning of pain.

143
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:26,375
But instead you give him orders like sit
down, don't get up, close your eyes

144
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,250
don't move your legs,
don't move your hands.

145
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,750
Is he a robot?

146
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,875
You don't have to control him.

147
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,750
You've to care for him. Tell him.

148
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:38,333
In fact, this condition is
being studied in the US as well.

149
00:09:38,417 --> 00:09:40,333
But there's been no breakthrough.

150
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:58,417
ARREST

151
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,542
Look Surya, when you get hurt like this

152
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,167
you must react by saying 'Ouch'!

153
00:10:15,292 --> 00:10:16,292
- What?
- Ouch.

154
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,708
- Ouch!
- Ouch!

155
00:10:17,792 --> 00:10:19,167
- Take that.
- Ouch!

156
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,667
Ouch!

157
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:25,542
<i>Like they say, 'Men don't feel pain!'</i>

158
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,625
<i>They don't know.</i>

159
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:29,750
<i>But insensitivity to
pain is not a superpower.</i>

160
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,125
<i>In fact, it's a medical condition.</i>

161
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:32,667
One ouch.

162
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,958
Two ouch.

163
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,167
Three ouch.

164
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:36,583
Yes.

165
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,208
<i>If I end up with a broken leg,
head, eye, nose, or ear.</i>

166
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,208
<i>Whatever breaks, I'll never know.</i>

167
00:10:43,917 --> 00:10:47,167
<i>In fact, not even low BP,
high BP or even a heart attack.</i>

168
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,292
<i>I feel nothing.</i>

169
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:58,500
<i>Grandpa made sure that I was never
ruffled because of my condition.</i>

170
00:10:59,167 --> 00:11:01,292
<i>And he trained me in such a way</i>

171
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:05,708
<i>so I would know every bone,
muscle and nerve in my body.</i>

172
00:11:06,042 --> 00:11:08,500
<i>And could fix anything that's broken.</i>

173
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:11,542
<i>Find a solution to any situation.</i>

174
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:23,042
<i>At an age when kids were
trying to deal with puberty</i>

175
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,833
<i>I was trying to understand
the concept of 'Ouch'.</i>

176
00:11:25,917 --> 00:11:30,708
Surya is a loser. Surya is a loser.

177
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,333
I've heard that you don't feel pain.

178
00:11:34,417 --> 00:11:38,542
<i>Children are pure at heart.
The apple of everyone's eye.</i>

179
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:42,625
<i>Anyone who believed this,
I am sure, had never been to school.</i>

180
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:45,958
Hit him. Hit him. Catch him.

181
00:11:46,042 --> 00:11:46,875
Catch him.

182
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,500
- Ouch!
- You're done for today.

183
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:55,208
<i>I am not scared of tigers</i>

184
00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:57,208
<i>But everyone's scared of cockroaches</i>

185
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:02,125
<i>You're not Mr. India</i>

186
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,708
- Supri is here.
- Supri!

187
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,042
<i>My best friend.</i>

188
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,375
<i>If I am Fire!</i>

189
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:13,625
<i>She's a Tornado!</i>

190
00:12:15,292 --> 00:12:16,792
Why are you crying?

191
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:18,875
You saved my life.

192
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,183
Ouch!

193
00:12:28,917 --> 00:12:31,208
Don't hit anyone with a bat the next time.

194
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,708
Use your hands instead.

195
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:36,042
<i>Supri was actually a very timid kid.</i>

196
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:39,542
<i>But if anyone tried to mess with
me... She would turn into the Hulk!</i>

197
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,125
<i>Here we go...</i>

198
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,458
<i>Rappan Rapi Rap</i>

199
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:48,750
<i>In dark allies and deserted streets</i>

200
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,625
<i>Rappan Rapi Rap</i>

201
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:53,583
<i>You be ready with your laser</i>

202
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,417
Look at this drunkard!

203
00:12:57,542 --> 00:12:59,458
He's drunk. <i>Rappan Rapi Rap</i>

204
00:12:59,542 --> 00:13:01,167
<i>With dragons stashed Away under your bed</i>

205
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,917
<i>We were thrown out of school</i>

206
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,667
<i>but they still wouldn't leave us alone.</i>

207
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,792
- Supri, jump.
- <i>It was us against the world.</i>

208
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:09,875
Watch me.

209
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,083
Surya!

210
00:13:16,042 --> 00:13:19,375
Supri, you don't know your own strength.

211
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:21,792
You're 100 times stronger than me.

212
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:22,750
Jump!

213
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:34,708
<i>Supri felt pain.</i>

214
00:13:36,042 --> 00:13:37,375
<i>But she never said Ouch.</i>

215
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,750
- Supri's drunk father is here.
- Let's run away.

216
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,000
You need to be wacked.

217
00:13:43,667 --> 00:13:45,708
- Move.
- Papa.

218
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:46,958
- <i>My Supri...</i>
- Let's go.

219
00:13:47,042 --> 00:13:48,375
- Surya..
- <i>She always stood up for others...</i>

220
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:49,500
Hey...

221
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,625
- <i>but never for herself.</i>
- Surya.

222
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:54,333
- <i>And I never understood why.</i>
- Supri...

223
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,667
Shoot Lasers from your
eyes and blow him up!

224
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,292
Good evening.

225
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:34,583
Young Master.

226
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:38,667
We'll have to fix this now.
Get this out first.

227
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,083
Here. Now wear this.

228
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:43,667
What is this?

229
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,375
This...

230
00:14:45,917 --> 00:14:46,792
It's magic.

231
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,875
Like Drunken Master's wine.

232
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,250
Samurai's Sword.

233
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,292
Jedi's Lightsaber.

234
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,458
Bruce Lee's Nunchaku.

235
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:00,000
This is your Water-Backpack.

236
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:03,125
Surya...

237
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,042
You must keep drinking water.

238
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,750
If not?

239
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,458
I will get dehydrated.

240
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,708
And if you get dehydrated?

241
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,083
Then what should you do?

242
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:18,708
Bravo.

243
00:15:20,292 --> 00:15:23,333
Surya, did you complete
the homework your father gave you?

244
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:27,625
First I must save Supri
from her evil father.

245
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:30,000
Look, your studies are
more important than Supri.

246
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:30,917
No!

247
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,208
When you're not around.
And, father's not around.

248
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,125
Supri protects me

249
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:36,667
from the whole world.

250
00:15:39,792 --> 00:15:41,167
Just like your mother.

251
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,500
Was mother just like me?

252
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,125
Did she train in Kung Fu too?

253
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,042
Then who killed her?

254
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,125
Surya...

255
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:05,208
if you want to
defeat Supri's father,

256
00:16:05,292 --> 00:16:07,292
then you must train harder.

257
00:16:08,042 --> 00:16:09,667
You're not ready yet.

258
00:16:10,417 --> 00:16:13,042
First, finish your homework,
and then I'll teach you.

259
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,917
I know what to do.

260
00:16:18,417 --> 00:16:20,958
Give me all the action movies you have.

261
00:16:21,042 --> 00:16:24,292
Yes, of course. Take all the VHS away.

262
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:25,833
And anyway, it's a time for DVDs.

263
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,958
<i>I thought I'll train by
watching all the action movies.</i>

264
00:16:32,042 --> 00:16:34,375
<i>It will help me defeat
Supri's evil father.</i>

265
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:45,958
ARREST

266
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,000
Surya, I am going to get angry now.

267
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,125
Enough.

268
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,458
Grandpa, this is the last one.
Mother promise.

269
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,958
Hundred-Man fight?

270
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:12,208
<i>Fight!</i>

271
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,542
What's a 100-Man Fight?

272
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:22,625
<i>Fight!</i>

273
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:35,708
<i>That one-legged karate man
was knocking out every fighter.</i>

274
00:17:35,792 --> 00:17:37,958
<i>Bam! Wham! Pow!</i>

275
00:17:38,042 --> 00:17:40,500
<i>I had seen every action movie there was.</i>

276
00:17:41,417 --> 00:17:42,750
<i>But had never seen anything like this.</i>

277
00:17:43,792 --> 00:17:47,583
<i>Every time he punched, I am sure
there would have been a loud ouch!</i>

278
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:51,375
Hey... Stop!

279
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,208
Okay.

280
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,417
Ready. Go!

281
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,042
Grandpa!

282
00:19:09,417 --> 00:19:10,417
What happened?

283
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,042
What happened?

284
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:14,167
I want to be the 100-Man Fighter.

285
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:18,167
Now, I'm going to save Supri.

286
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,042
Behind every mind-blowing story...

287
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,083
are some pretty bad decisions.

288
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,958
Supri!

289
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,208
Supri!

290
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,875
Supri!

291
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:45,375
What are you doing there?

292
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,417
I thought the door is closed.

293
00:19:48,042 --> 00:19:49,625
Yes, but what are you doing here?

294
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,333
My mom's in danger.

295
00:19:51,417 --> 00:19:54,458
My dad stole her gold chain.

296
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,458
Don't worry, now I can fight 100 men.

297
00:20:03,542 --> 00:20:04,917
Dad said that

298
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,292
if she doesn't give him
the gold chain, he will kill her

299
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,083
just like those chain-snatchers
killed Surya's mom.

300
00:20:21,542 --> 00:20:24,125
<i>Supri's father was no
longer just an evil father.</i>

301
00:20:24,417 --> 00:20:25,833
<i>He was a chain-snatcher.</i>

302
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:29,125
<i>And because my mother was killed
by a chain-snatcher</i>

303
00:20:29,417 --> 00:20:31,000
<i>Supri and I swore</i>

304
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:36,833
<i>to rid the city of chain-snatchers
un, dos, tres, Kaboom!</i>

305
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:44,917
Supri, wear it.

306
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,500
Hey chain-snatcher!

307
00:20:56,917 --> 00:20:58,000
Uncle... Uncle...

308
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,750
Hey chain-snatcher!

309
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:08,417
Should we jump,
or should we wait for that thief?

310
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,500
I don't want to jump.

311
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:13,250
Hey, I am coming. Stay there.

312
00:21:13,667 --> 00:21:16,083
He called me a thief.

313
00:21:16,167 --> 00:21:18,042
- He called me a thief.
- Get lost.

314
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,333
What is it?

315
00:21:19,417 --> 00:21:21,750
He is such a slowpoke.

316
00:21:24,167 --> 00:21:25,583
Surya.

317
00:21:26,417 --> 00:21:28,458
Come down. Come down.

318
00:21:29,042 --> 00:21:30,542
'I am the Destroyer of Evil.'

319
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:31,542
'Flames of Justice.'

320
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,375
'Arrest him.'

321
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,042
Surya!

322
00:22:42,167 --> 00:22:44,375
Apologize. Apologize now.

323
00:22:44,917 --> 00:22:47,875
This is an attempt to murder.
Someone call the police.

324
00:22:48,042 --> 00:22:49,833
<i>According to our neighbors...</i>

325
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:54,500
<i>I was a beast, a killer, a terrorist.</i>

326
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:56,292
<i>Danger to everyone.</i>

327
00:22:56,917 --> 00:23:01,292
<i>They said if we don't leave
they will call the Police.</i>

328
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,542
<i>I would have to do time in jail.</i>

329
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:08,292
<i>But there was a bit of confusion here,
I was the hero in this situation...</i>

330
00:23:09,417 --> 00:23:10,917
<i>so how did I become a villain?</i>

331
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,833
Are you trying to be a hero?
Want to be jailed?

332
00:23:23,292 --> 00:23:25,083
Not a hero, Karate Man.

333
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:27,958
Karate...

334
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:30,167
Ouch!

335
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:33,583
Why don't you feel anything?

336
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:37,625
Do you understand?
Do you understand murder?

337
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,708
Someone could've died today.

338
00:23:39,792 --> 00:23:42,208
Why did you let mother's killers escape!

339
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,125
Hey...

340
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:01,042
No.

341
00:24:53,917 --> 00:24:55,917
Am I wrong about everything, Grandpa?

342
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,875
I even broke the promise I made to Supri.

343
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:02,000
What about Supri now?

344
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:05,500
She must be waiting for me.

345
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:10,042
Look, Surya, you must fulfill
your father's wishes first...

346
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:12,333
and then your promise.

347
00:25:13,458 --> 00:25:14,667
Your father's not wrong.

348
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,708
If anything happens to you

349
00:25:18,292 --> 00:25:20,000
then you won't be able
to keep your promise anyway.

350
00:25:20,625 --> 00:25:22,125
So am I wrong?

351
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:26,875
At your age, there is no right or wrong.

352
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:32,042
When I was your age,
I wanted to fight the British.

353
00:25:32,417 --> 00:25:34,875
I was obsessed about
meeting Netaji, my Leader.

354
00:25:34,958 --> 00:25:37,333
Joining the Indian National Army.
Defeating the British.

355
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:39,250
I ran away from home.

356
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,750
But in spite of all my efforts,
I couldn't find Netaji.

357
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,458
One day I found out
that Netaji was in Japan.

358
00:25:47,125 --> 00:25:48,708
So I went to Japan.

359
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:51,458
Then he went to Germany.
And I followed him to Germany.

360
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:55,250
- Ouch!
- On foot, or by bus.

361
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:57,167
Or by sneaking in cargo ships.

362
00:25:58,208 --> 00:25:59,250
I made it there.

363
00:26:02,458 --> 00:26:04,667
Finally, when I met Netaji.

364
00:26:04,917 --> 00:26:08,292
He looked at me, I looked at him.

365
00:26:10,375 --> 00:26:12,333
He embraced me, heard my story.

366
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:13,417
And said.

367
00:26:14,417 --> 00:26:17,333
Give this idiot some food or he will die.

368
00:26:20,292 --> 00:26:22,167
I looked at myself.

369
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:25,208
I had reduced to a bag of bones.

370
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:32,625
I had spent all my energy
trying to find Netaji.

371
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:33,667
Completely wasted.

372
00:26:38,917 --> 00:26:42,042
Grandpa, I thought I'll
become the 100-Man fighter.

373
00:26:43,875 --> 00:26:45,708
But I couldn't even beat four.

374
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,375
It takes 15-20 years
to learn martial arts.

375
00:26:57,458 --> 00:26:59,208
A couple of weeks is not good enough.

376
00:27:00,792 --> 00:27:03,125
Today you lost to a couple of guys.

377
00:27:03,917 --> 00:27:05,000
But don't worry.

378
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:08,667
You must train. You must train hard.

379
00:27:09,292 --> 00:27:11,500
One day you'll become the Karate Man.

380
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:15,417
And you will catch the chain-snatcher.

381
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:19,625
Does the chain-snatcher's
gang have more than 100 people?

382
00:27:20,208 --> 00:27:23,917
How does it matter? Be it 100 or 200.

383
00:27:24,458 --> 00:27:25,542
You must train.

384
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:28,083
But you must train in secrecy.

385
00:27:28,792 --> 00:27:30,708
No one must know.

386
00:27:31,708 --> 00:27:34,500
Code word; Stealth Ninja Cat.

387
00:27:35,083 --> 00:27:38,250
- Stealth Ninja Cat?
- Yes. Code word.

388
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,583
Stealth Ninja Cat.

389
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:42,917
Here you go.

390
00:27:46,125 --> 00:27:47,125
Surya!

391
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,208
- Surya!
- Yes.

392
00:27:49,708 --> 00:27:50,667
He's sleeping. He's sleeping.

393
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,542
- Why did you let him go out?
- He's resting.

394
00:27:52,667 --> 00:27:53,500
Where were you?

395
00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:55,000
- How did he go out?
- I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

396
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:56,625
- But...
- Come with me.

397
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:57,917
- Surya...
- Come on. Come with me.

398
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,875
- How did he go out?
- Let me explain.

399
00:28:00,958 --> 00:28:02,750
- How could you let him go out?
- Slowly... Slowly...

400
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:05,333
He's scared.

401
00:28:05,833 --> 00:28:06,750
Scared?

402
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:13,250
I had told you to stop
your hippie and pop philosophies.

403
00:28:13,667 --> 00:28:15,833
- Let him settle down.
- Settle.

404
00:28:17,292 --> 00:28:20,250
You know what...
Just leave us. You leave us.

405
00:28:20,917 --> 00:28:22,125
- Leave?
- Yes.

406
00:28:22,375 --> 00:28:23,667
But this is my house.

407
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:29,792
See.

408
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:34,583
You raised your daughter
on your philosophies.

409
00:28:35,958 --> 00:28:37,833
Even I liked her the way she was.

410
00:28:38,625 --> 00:28:41,750
But it's not possible
to live like that practically.

411
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:45,375
Which is why...

412
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,917
she is no longer with us.

413
00:28:51,417 --> 00:28:55,792
I have lost her, and now
I don't want to lose Surya.

414
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:59,500
A person can't live the way he thinks

415
00:28:59,583 --> 00:29:01,375
certain rules and laws
have to be followed.

416
00:29:01,458 --> 00:29:03,542
One has to live within these boundaries.

417
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:08,083
And Surya must follow them too,
or else my son will die.

418
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:10,458
He will die.

419
00:29:14,417 --> 00:29:16,708
Surya, did you cut your nails?

420
00:29:19,042 --> 00:29:19,917
Very good.

421
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,542
Surya, breakfast?

422
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:23,958
Good.

423
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:27,542
Surya, geometry test in 15 minutes.

424
00:29:28,708 --> 00:29:29,583
Surya.

425
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:38,500
Very good.

426
00:29:38,583 --> 00:29:40,792
No maintenance for this month.

427
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:43,458
Surya, sleep.

428
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:47,292
Get up!

429
00:30:12,125 --> 00:30:13,458
<i>Grandpa once said.</i>

430
00:30:14,042 --> 00:30:17,417
<i>Bruce Lee neither knew how
to swim nor drive a car properly.</i>

431
00:30:18,042 --> 00:30:19,875
<i>He even had poor eyesight.</i>

432
00:30:20,292 --> 00:30:23,458
<i>In fact, he used to get
epileptic seizures as a kid.</i>

433
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,667
<i>But he became what he was destined to be.</i>

434
00:30:26,292 --> 00:30:28,917
<i>Karate Man had only one leg.</i>

435
00:30:29,375 --> 00:30:30,875
<i>But still, he knocked out 100 men.</i>

436
00:30:31,583 --> 00:30:33,917
<i>Most people have trouble starting out.</i>

437
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:35,917
<i>Some have to start
from a complete breakdown.</i>

438
00:30:36,917 --> 00:30:38,125
<i>But that's just the beginning.</i>

439
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,708
<i>You've to write your own story after that.</i>

440
00:30:41,958 --> 00:30:44,917
<i>And I am already writing mine,
and it's absolutely mind-blowing.</i>

441
00:30:45,125 --> 00:30:46,917
<i>But I am doing it like a Ninja Cat.</i>

442
00:31:27,208 --> 00:31:29,750
<i>Away we go...</i>

443
00:31:30,458 --> 00:31:31,417
<i>Shaolin sky...</i>

444
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,875
<i>Away we go...</i>

445
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,417
<i>Shaolin sky...</i>

446
00:31:35,542 --> 00:31:37,500
<i>Away we go...</i>

447
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,375
<i>Shaolin sky...</i>

448
00:31:39,458 --> 00:31:41,417
<i>Away we go...</i>

449
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,625
<i>Away we go...</i>

450
00:32:02,417 --> 00:32:05,333
<i>Shaolin sky
Away we go</i>

451
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:07,292
<i>Shaolin sky...</i>

452
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:09,333
<i>Away we go...</i>

453
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:11,250
<i>Shaolin sky...</i>

454
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:13,542
<i>Away we go...</i>

455
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:23,667
<i>Shaolin sky...</i>

456
00:32:29,917 --> 00:32:34,083
Surya, in this stage of life,
you should be interested in a filly.

457
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:36,042
Filly.

458
00:32:36,667 --> 00:32:37,875
Not Bruce Lee.

459
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:39,708
Wait a minute.

460
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,083
I want this.

461
00:32:45,083 --> 00:32:46,375
- Cheap.
- Look.

462
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:47,708
Shut up.

463
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:49,458
Grandpa, please.

464
00:32:49,542 --> 00:32:50,583
Gra...

465
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:55,208
<i>Shaolin sky...</i>

466
00:32:55,292 --> 00:32:58,417
<i>Nice and slow...</i>

467
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,417
<i>Shaolin sky...</i>

468
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,333
<i>Nice and slow...</i>

469
00:33:01,417 --> 00:33:02,542
<i>Nice and slow...</i>

470
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:05,125
<i>Nice and slow...</i>

471
00:33:05,208 --> 00:33:06,333
<i>Nice and slow...</i>

472
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:07,417
<i>Shaolin sky...</i>

473
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,208
<i>Nice and slow...</i>

474
00:33:09,292 --> 00:33:11,083
<i>Nice and slow
Shaolin sky</i>

475
00:33:11,167 --> 00:33:13,375
<i>Nice and slow...</i>

476
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:14,417
<i>Nice and slow...</i>

477
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,542
<i>Shaolin sky
Nice and slow</i>

478
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,625
<i>Shaolin sky...</i>

479
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:31,792
<i>Shaolin sky...</i>

480
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,792
For how long will you keep
beating around the bush?

481
00:33:41,417 --> 00:33:43,417
You're a grownup now. Time to wake up.

482
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,708
Eww, Grandpa.

483
00:33:46,792 --> 00:33:47,875
What 'eww'?

484
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:51,333
Guys who say 'eww' end up
having 15 kids in a row.

485
00:33:51,833 --> 00:33:52,958
Right!

486
00:33:57,250 --> 00:34:00,542
You have a one-track mind.

487
00:34:00,875 --> 00:34:02,458
- Where to?
- I can't...

488
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:04,458
Taking your car for a spin, huh!

489
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,167
Listen.

490
00:34:17,125 --> 00:34:19,917
Your son goes to the toilet
10 times every day.

491
00:34:21,583 --> 00:34:23,333
His car is running at full throttle

492
00:34:24,667 --> 00:34:27,625
He's matured.

493
00:34:28,458 --> 00:34:30,083
You should let him see the world.

494
00:34:35,958 --> 00:34:36,875
So...

495
00:34:39,333 --> 00:34:42,125
I wanted to talk to you.

496
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:44,583
Your car's running full throttle too

497
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:45,958
Schumacher.

498
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:50,333
You know that.

499
00:34:52,208 --> 00:34:53,292
Nice.

500
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:56,292
She wants to meet Surya.

501
00:34:56,792 --> 00:34:58,250
She's been chewing my brains.

502
00:34:59,083 --> 00:35:00,208
So let them meet.

503
00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:02,500
Won't he feel awkward?

504
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:05,083
I kept him locked up in
here for so long, while I was...

505
00:35:07,458 --> 00:35:08,875
Don't you think he will be...

506
00:35:10,458 --> 00:35:13,000
No, no... Just tell him,
he will understand.

507
00:35:13,333 --> 00:35:14,875
But how do I explain it to him?

508
00:35:17,208 --> 00:35:19,250
Surya, he wants to have
a chat about your step-mother.

509
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:21,792
What...

510
00:35:21,917 --> 00:35:22,875
Why?

511
00:35:22,958 --> 00:35:25,958
- Why are you doing this?
- It's pretty simple.

512
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:29,208
When man and woman have agreed,
who is Surya to poke his nose?

513
00:35:29,458 --> 00:35:30,458
Okay.

514
00:35:31,042 --> 00:35:37,333
Do you think Surya will tell
her that he has had a very good life?

515
00:35:37,417 --> 00:35:38,375
Yes. Yes.

516
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:42,083
Be honest with me. Am I a bad person?

517
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,833
No, no.

518
00:35:45,458 --> 00:35:46,375
Then...

519
00:35:46,917 --> 00:35:51,042
- You knew about the circumstances.
- Yes.

520
00:35:51,333 --> 00:35:53,958
You don't get tense. Chill. Chill.

521
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,125
You know, I am not able to perform.

522
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:08,833
No problem. You're fine. No problem.

523
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:15,000
Father... Are we
going to the market tomorrow?

524
00:36:18,917 --> 00:36:20,458
Here, keep this.

525
00:36:21,458 --> 00:36:27,708
Buy whatever you like,
clothes, shoes, anything.

526
00:36:29,292 --> 00:36:30,583
When you go meet her tomorrow.

527
00:36:32,708 --> 00:36:35,125
Choose some nice words.

528
00:36:36,417 --> 00:36:37,792
Like 'mother like mother'.

529
00:36:39,542 --> 00:36:41,125
'Companion for your father'.

530
00:36:41,958 --> 00:36:46,708
Don't use words like
'Romance' or 'Affair'.

531
00:36:46,875 --> 00:36:50,833
It can have a negative
influence on the child.

532
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:52,917
I know. I know.

533
00:36:53,625 --> 00:36:56,833
I'll tell him your father needs sex!

534
00:36:56,917 --> 00:36:59,833
<i>One-two, 2-2, 3-2.</i>

535
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:01,875
<i>Four-two.</i>

536
00:37:01,958 --> 00:37:02,875
<i>Five-two.</i>

537
00:37:02,958 --> 00:37:03,958
<i>Six-two.</i>

538
00:37:04,042 --> 00:37:05,833
<i>Seven-two.
Eight-two.</i>

539
00:37:05,917 --> 00:37:08,042
<i>One-two...</i>

540
00:37:13,542 --> 00:37:17,958
I don't want her to feel
that I am a paranoid man.

541
00:37:27,792 --> 00:37:30,917
<i>I guess I was waiting
to be free for so long...</i>

542
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:33,292
<i>that I completely forgot
that I've been waiting for this day.</i>

543
00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:35,708
<i>But now that I have this
freedom, what do I do?</i>

544
00:37:35,792 --> 00:37:36,625
<i>Dance?</i>

545
00:37:36,917 --> 00:37:40,125
<i>What did India do with
70 years of Independence?</i>

546
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:43,083
What are you thinking about?

547
00:37:43,833 --> 00:37:46,667
Grandpa, what did India achieve
in 70 years since Independence?

548
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:48,708
What did it achieve?

549
00:37:48,958 --> 00:37:52,500
Sir, what did India achieve in 70 years?

550
00:37:52,833 --> 00:37:54,333
I shouldn't say this probably

551
00:37:54,417 --> 00:37:57,750
because I am just a cabby with
an opinion but what I want to...

552
00:37:57,833 --> 00:37:59,292
No, don't say it.

553
00:37:59,375 --> 00:38:01,083
I don't like opinions, don't tell me.

554
00:38:01,708 --> 00:38:03,083
Will you stay quiet for a minute?

555
00:38:03,167 --> 00:38:05,667
- Okay.
- I want to make an urgent call.

556
00:38:07,792 --> 00:38:12,000
Hello, I can't take Surya to meet Nandini.

557
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:12,917
<i>Why?</i>

558
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,083
Because he's not ready.

559
00:38:16,167 --> 00:38:18,625
<i>But you told me.</i>

560
00:38:18,708 --> 00:38:19,792
Then listen...

561
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:22,875
Stop calling me after every five minutes.

562
00:38:22,958 --> 00:38:24,292
Where have I reached?
Where have I reached?

563
00:38:24,375 --> 00:38:25,917
<i>Please after two hours then.</i>

564
00:38:26,833 --> 00:38:29,458
Okay, okay, after two hours.

565
00:38:29,542 --> 00:38:32,292
- Okay.
<i>- Please, after two hours.</i>

566
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,583
What happened?

567
00:38:36,792 --> 00:38:39,958
Come, let's return to innocence.

568
00:39:00,542 --> 00:39:01,667
Grandpa.

569
00:39:02,292 --> 00:39:04,667
Are they going to raze this building?

570
00:39:05,083 --> 00:39:06,708
It's an old building.
They will build a new one.

571
00:39:07,875 --> 00:39:10,917
It's called Redevelopment.

572
00:39:11,125 --> 00:39:12,125
Come, sit.

573
00:39:14,208 --> 00:39:15,333
Just a minute.

574
00:39:17,583 --> 00:39:19,583
Even humans should undergo
periodic redevelopment.

575
00:39:19,917 --> 00:39:20,958
It's a good thing.

576
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,083
Listen, we must go
meet Nandini after this.

577
00:39:26,667 --> 00:39:27,667
Nandini...

578
00:39:29,125 --> 00:39:31,417
She's the one father
keeps chatting with all night.

579
00:39:32,667 --> 00:39:33,500
Isn't she?

580
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:34,625
You know.

581
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:39,708
Your father is planning to marry her.

582
00:39:40,667 --> 00:39:41,542
Okay.

583
00:39:44,708 --> 00:39:45,958
Your father is a nice man.

584
00:39:47,208 --> 00:39:48,708
Are you angry?

585
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:51,875
Should I be?

586
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:54,833
I don't know.

587
00:39:57,333 --> 00:39:58,292
He...

588
00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:00,792
Where are you going?

589
00:40:02,417 --> 00:40:03,333
Hey...

590
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,833
I brought you here so
that you can vent your anger.

591
00:40:07,333 --> 00:40:08,375
Listen...

592
00:40:10,833 --> 00:40:14,083
Listen...
Just say whatever is on your mind.

593
00:40:14,833 --> 00:40:15,750
Yeah...

594
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:17,500
Free your mind.

595
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Where are you?

596
00:40:29,333 --> 00:40:30,583
Whatever you want to say.

597
00:40:31,208 --> 00:40:32,500
Say it from there.

598
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,333
Say it aloud.

599
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,542
Whatever is on your mind.

600
00:40:36,042 --> 00:40:37,583
<i>Hey chain-snatcher!</i>

601
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:39,583
<i>I don't want to jump.</i>

602
00:40:40,167 --> 00:40:42,167
<i>'I am the Destroyer of Evil.'</i>

603
00:40:42,458 --> 00:40:43,750
<i>'Flames of Justice.'</i>

604
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:45,958
'Arrest him.'

605
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:58,417
Catch those junkies!

606
00:40:59,625 --> 00:41:00,875
You scum.

607
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:08,750
Get in old man.
You'll get your fix in prison.

608
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,333
Where do you think you're going?
Go back upstairs.

609
00:41:24,417 --> 00:41:25,500
To the terrace.

610
00:41:25,958 --> 00:41:26,917
Cops never climb stairs.

611
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,167
Who are you? You look new around here.

612
00:41:43,208 --> 00:41:46,875
<i>I now know which police
station they took grandpa to.</i>

613
00:41:48,417 --> 00:41:52,792
<i>I might have to fight a few
corrupt police officers to free him.</i>

614
00:41:53,875 --> 00:41:55,167
<i>But I was prepared.</i>

615
00:42:02,625 --> 00:42:03,458
<i>Shit.</i>

616
00:42:03,542 --> 00:42:05,958
<i>They might even be torturing grandpa.</i>

617
00:42:07,833 --> 00:42:10,625
They call me Johnny.

618
00:42:12,125 --> 00:42:13,917
<i>If they lay a finger on him...</i>

619
00:42:14,167 --> 00:42:17,750
<i>I'll just go un, dos,
tres, Kaboom! And break their bones.</i>

620
00:42:28,292 --> 00:42:29,333
Ouch.

621
00:43:02,667 --> 00:43:04,417
<i>I think this is just
too insanely contrived.</i>

622
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:05,708
<i>But still...</i>

623
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:09,125
<i>To check whether is this the real life?</i>

624
00:43:09,208 --> 00:43:11,208
<i>I can pinch myself, or even bite...</i>

625
00:43:11,917 --> 00:43:13,500
<i>but that won't make any difference to me.</i>

626
00:43:14,292 --> 00:43:16,125
<i>I think I should let gravity decide.</i>

627
00:43:25,208 --> 00:43:27,333
<i>This is the real life! Not a fantasy.</i>

628
00:43:28,667 --> 00:43:29,542
Ouch!

629
00:43:34,208 --> 00:43:35,042
Hello.

630
00:43:35,125 --> 00:43:36,083
Yes, Atul.

631
00:43:36,875 --> 00:43:40,000
I came to get the leaving
certificate, like I said.

632
00:43:40,875 --> 00:43:41,875
Sorry.

633
00:43:42,375 --> 00:43:44,375
No, no.
I'll come home early.

634
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:47,083
Okay, bye.

635
00:43:50,208 --> 00:43:51,083
Excuse me ma'am.

636
00:43:51,708 --> 00:43:54,792
I am not a black belt,
but I want to participate.

637
00:43:54,875 --> 00:43:56,083
I...

638
00:43:59,792 --> 00:44:00,958
Don't let anyone see.

639
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,458
No need to worry.
She's our friend.

640
00:44:17,167 --> 00:44:19,167
She's wasted,
we're taking her to the hospital.

641
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:20,375
What's her name?

642
00:44:21,958 --> 00:44:23,250
Sh... Shivangi.

643
00:44:23,333 --> 00:44:24,375
Her name is Shivangi.

644
00:44:25,542 --> 00:44:26,583
Any problem?

645
00:44:30,875 --> 00:44:31,917
Let's take her to the hospital, come on.

646
00:44:36,042 --> 00:44:37,625
Shift a little, make space for me.

647
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:39,250
I cannot shift anymore, you shift.

648
00:44:39,333 --> 00:44:40,667
Listen, this is not a 7-seater.

649
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:42,750
Get a cab.

650
00:44:43,542 --> 00:44:44,958
Why should I always get a cab?

651
00:44:45,542 --> 00:44:46,875
See you later.
You're such a dog.

652
00:44:46,958 --> 00:44:47,917
Where are the keys?

653
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,250
He probably hid it.

654
00:44:50,042 --> 00:44:50,958
I don't know.

655
00:45:00,167 --> 00:45:01,250
Move out, guys.

656
00:45:06,958 --> 00:45:07,917
Keys?

657
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:10,792
Check her.

658
00:45:16,708 --> 00:45:17,875
We're looking for the key.

659
00:45:18,958 --> 00:45:19,958
Not lipstick.

660
00:45:25,792 --> 00:45:26,958
Keys...

661
00:45:33,333 --> 00:45:34,875
<i>O mercurial one...</i>

662
00:45:35,542 --> 00:45:36,500
Wow.

663
00:45:37,625 --> 00:45:38,750
<i>O mercurial one...</i>

664
00:45:41,833 --> 00:45:43,083
<i>O mercurial one...</i>

665
00:45:43,167 --> 00:45:47,708
<i>They all look so naïve...</i>

666
00:45:50,542 --> 00:45:52,375
<i>Mysterious beauties</i>

667
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:54,375
<i>Trying to work their charm on me</i>

668
00:45:55,083 --> 00:45:57,250
<i>Mysterious beauties</i>

669
00:45:57,333 --> 00:45:58,917
<i>Trying to work their charm on me</i>

670
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,750
<i>An enchantress at heart</i>

671
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,542
<i>She was something else</i>

672
00:46:05,625 --> 00:46:08,667
<i>Who cast a spell on me</i>

673
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:09,917
Oh!

674
00:46:12,333 --> 00:46:13,167
Give me the keys.

675
00:46:37,708 --> 00:46:39,083
<i>O steely one...</i>

676
00:46:40,083 --> 00:46:41,292
<i>Quicksilver...</i>

677
00:46:42,042 --> 00:46:45,750
<i>At least tell me Where I can find you</i>

678
00:46:45,833 --> 00:46:47,750
<i>O stormy one...</i>

679
00:46:48,625 --> 00:46:50,042
<i>O beautiful...</i>

680
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:52,292
<i>My restlessness...</i>

681
00:46:53,042 --> 00:46:56,625
<i>Keeps soaring, At least smile for me</i>

682
00:46:56,792 --> 00:46:59,042
<i>O steely one...</i>

683
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:01,583
<i>She was something else</i>

684
00:47:01,667 --> 00:47:05,417
<i>Who cast a spell on me with her eyes</i>

685
00:47:06,083 --> 00:47:08,167
<i>She was something else</i>

686
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:11,750
<i>Who cast a spell on me with her eyes</i>

687
00:47:33,125 --> 00:47:35,000
<i>O steely one...</i>

688
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:37,125
<i>Quicksilver...</i>

689
00:47:37,333 --> 00:47:40,958
<i>At least tell me Where I can find you</i>

690
00:47:41,042 --> 00:47:43,542
<i>O stormy one...</i>

691
00:47:43,625 --> 00:47:45,792
<i>O beautiful...</i>

692
00:47:45,958 --> 00:47:48,000
<i>My restlessness...</i>

693
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:52,000
<i>Keeps soaring, at least smile for me</i>

694
00:47:52,083 --> 00:47:54,542
<i>O steely one...</i>

695
00:47:54,625 --> 00:47:57,042
<i>She was something else</i>

696
00:47:57,125 --> 00:48:00,458
<i>Who cast a spell on me with her eyes</i>

697
00:48:01,625 --> 00:48:03,833
- <i>She was something else...</i>
- Give me the keys.

698
00:48:03,917 --> 00:48:07,250
<i>Who cast a spell on me with her eyes</i>

699
00:48:12,458 --> 00:48:13,542
Shit.

700
00:48:37,708 --> 00:48:38,667
Oh!

701
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:39,958
Grandpa.

702
00:48:44,042 --> 00:48:45,083
Hey...

703
00:48:48,417 --> 00:48:50,042
- There you are.
- What are you doing?

704
00:48:50,625 --> 00:48:52,417
They even sent a vehicle for you.

705
00:48:53,583 --> 00:48:56,208
He's my grandson. Surya.

706
00:48:56,792 --> 00:48:58,042
New to the city.

707
00:48:58,125 --> 00:48:59,125
Come.

708
00:48:59,208 --> 00:49:00,917
- Are you fine?
- Mind-blowing.

709
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,167
It was just a misunderstanding. Come, sit.

710
00:49:04,083 --> 00:49:05,333
Sit.

711
00:49:12,125 --> 00:49:14,917
<i>O mercurial one...</i>

712
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:24,583
<i>If I've to choose between Night and day</i>

713
00:49:24,667 --> 00:49:27,042
<i>I'll say it's night for me</i>

714
00:49:27,125 --> 00:49:31,625
<i>The sound in the dark Has always guided me</i>

715
00:49:32,042 --> 00:49:36,417
<i>My wounds are sound asleep</i>

716
00:49:36,833 --> 00:49:41,542
<i>But are ready for an awakening now</i>

717
00:49:41,625 --> 00:49:45,917
<i>So many similar feelings
Have sprung up suddenly</i>

718
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:50,833
<i>Even you must feel what
I felt when you lit up</i>

719
00:49:50,917 --> 00:49:52,667
<i>O mercurial one...</i>

720
00:49:55,583 --> 00:49:58,125
<i>O mercurial one...</i>

721
00:50:00,167 --> 00:50:02,458
<i>O mercurial one...</i>

722
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:07,667
<i>O mercurial one...</i>

723
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,542
Sorry, we're late.

724
00:50:23,625 --> 00:50:25,125
I am leaving, Ma'am.

725
00:50:39,458 --> 00:50:40,417
Grandpa.

726
00:50:40,958 --> 00:50:41,958
Surya.

727
00:50:59,625 --> 00:51:01,000
Here comes Alibaba.

728
00:51:03,125 --> 00:51:04,875
Are you okay?

729
00:51:05,542 --> 00:51:08,125
The first time we met...

730
00:51:08,208 --> 00:51:09,500
I'm not interested.

731
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,958
She's nice.

732
00:51:21,292 --> 00:51:24,375
Jatin told me about your condition.

733
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:27,125
But, it's so hard to believe.

734
00:51:30,042 --> 00:51:30,917
Are you okay?

735
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,458
<i>The things you do to me</i>

736
00:51:33,542 --> 00:51:35,625
<i>Even when my eyes are closed</i>

737
00:51:35,708 --> 00:51:40,292
<i>At least let me differentiate
Between dreams and reality</i>

738
00:51:40,875 --> 00:51:45,083
<i>My wounds sing a weird tune secretly</i>

739
00:51:45,167 --> 00:51:47,958
<i>I am tired of hearing it</i>

740
00:51:48,042 --> 00:51:50,708
<i>But thank God now you're here for me</i>

741
00:51:50,792 --> 00:51:55,583
<i>No need to save your prayers for me</i>

742
00:51:55,667 --> 00:51:57,792
<i>This party isn't going to stop</i>

743
00:51:57,875 --> 00:51:59,500
<i>You can come over if you please</i>

744
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:01,333
<i>O mercurial one...</i>

745
00:52:04,417 --> 00:52:07,000
<i>O mercurial one...</i>

746
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:11,167
<i>O mercurial one...</i>

747
00:52:14,042 --> 00:52:17,125
<i>O mercurial one...</i>

748
00:52:20,167 --> 00:52:22,000
<i>If a broken star's Lying on the ground</i>

749
00:52:22,083 --> 00:52:23,833
<i>No one makes a wish</i>

750
00:52:24,792 --> 00:52:27,000
<i>If the ocean's water is still</i>

751
00:52:27,125 --> 00:52:29,000
<i>Everyone hurls a stone at it</i>

752
00:52:29,583 --> 00:52:34,000
<i>It's hard to find new words
To tell the same old story</i>

753
00:52:34,333 --> 00:52:38,375
<i>The part of me that's been lost
Forever, can never be found again</i>

754
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:47,542
<i>O mercurial one...</i>

755
00:53:10,458 --> 00:53:13,208
Please handle father if he asks.

756
00:53:13,708 --> 00:53:14,625
I am going.

757
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,250
Stealth Ninja Cat.

758
00:53:44,958 --> 00:53:47,000
<i>Ideally I should have said
this as soon as I see him...</i>

759
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:48,917
<i>Master. Sensei.</i>

760
00:53:49,375 --> 00:53:50,250
<i>Karate Man.</i>

761
00:53:50,417 --> 00:53:51,583
<i>I've always been your fan.</i>

762
00:53:53,417 --> 00:53:56,458
<i>But I wonder why I only wanted to ask...</i>

763
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,500
<i>Master, where's the girl
who was putting up the posters?</i>

764
00:54:56,125 --> 00:54:57,958
Jimmy... return my locket.

765
00:55:11,958 --> 00:55:13,500
<i>O mercurial one...</i>

766
00:55:16,583 --> 00:55:18,792
<i>O mercurial one...</i>

767
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:23,500
<i>O mercurial one...</i>

768
00:55:26,208 --> 00:55:28,917
<i>O mercurial one...</i>

769
00:55:34,208 --> 00:55:36,042
Ouch.

770
00:56:13,958 --> 00:56:16,083
- Careful...
- Jimmy.

771
00:56:17,625 --> 00:56:20,125
Jimmy... Jimmy is back.

772
00:56:20,208 --> 00:56:21,333
What are you doing? Pick him up.

773
00:56:23,708 --> 00:56:25,292
- What happened?
- Where were you?

774
00:56:25,375 --> 00:56:27,000
- I went to get some tea.
- Didn't you hear...

775
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:28,125
- Mani.
- Jimmy is back.

776
00:56:29,917 --> 00:56:31,917
I can only smell paint. Where's the blood?

777
00:56:34,875 --> 00:56:35,917
Who is staying back?

778
00:56:36,958 --> 00:56:38,583
- Pablo.
- Hey...

779
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:40,000
What?

780
00:56:40,083 --> 00:56:42,958
I can't stand hospitals. Makes me dizzy.

781
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:44,667
Dizzy! Seriously!

782
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:46,542
Please Supri, let me go.

783
00:56:47,125 --> 00:56:48,500
Will you stay?

784
00:56:53,542 --> 00:56:55,500
Listen, please stay back.

785
00:56:58,417 --> 00:56:59,792
Okay! I'll stay.

786
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:01,583
Stay for who?

787
00:57:02,625 --> 00:57:03,917
- Stay for what?
- What happened?

788
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,792
Why doesn't she stay
back if she's so concerned?

789
00:57:06,875 --> 00:57:08,917
She will wink at you, look
at someone else over your shoulder

790
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,375
and fly away with someone else.

791
00:57:10,625 --> 00:57:12,333
I know this since I was this.

792
00:57:12,417 --> 00:57:13,833
- Okay. Bye.
- What?

793
00:57:18,875 --> 00:57:21,042
What are you doing?

794
00:57:21,125 --> 00:57:23,042
You know how he is. Please leave him.

795
00:57:23,625 --> 00:57:24,750
No fighting in here.

796
00:57:24,958 --> 00:57:26,833
- Get out of here.
- You know how he is.

797
00:57:26,917 --> 00:57:28,958
That's how is. Please leave him.

798
00:57:30,625 --> 00:57:33,458
I don't want to get involved
with these warring brothers...

799
00:57:33,542 --> 00:57:35,083
Why are we inviting trouble for ourselves?

800
00:57:36,542 --> 00:57:37,958
- Come.
- Listen.

801
00:57:46,833 --> 00:57:47,708
I am right here.

802
00:57:48,083 --> 00:57:49,167
I am not going anywhere.

803
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:52,000
Mother promise.

804
00:58:08,958 --> 00:58:09,958
Hello.

805
00:58:10,042 --> 00:58:11,167
<i>Where are you, Supri?</i>

806
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:14,792
Actually, I was with my college friends.

807
00:58:14,875 --> 00:58:15,958
My farewell dinner.

808
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:17,917
That's why I am late.

809
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:39,333
Do you know what these are?

810
00:58:39,958 --> 00:58:42,458
Your mother's medicines,
your father's medicines.

811
00:58:43,458 --> 00:58:45,042
It costs me a bomb every month,
you know that.

812
00:58:46,292 --> 00:58:49,917
Sorry Atul, I had to come over
because it was an emergency.

813
00:58:50,042 --> 00:58:52,833
- You know I have left everything.
- Supri, please stop lying.

814
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,208
I just don't like it.

815
00:58:57,083 --> 00:58:58,083
Sorry.

816
00:58:58,917 --> 00:58:59,875
- Enough of this.
- Atul.

817
00:58:59,958 --> 00:59:01,000
- Where's your bindi?
- Just one second..

818
00:59:01,083 --> 00:59:02,000
Just listen to me, I...

819
00:59:02,667 --> 00:59:09,500
<i>As I took a step towards you</i>

820
00:59:09,583 --> 00:59:15,125
<i>You took a step back from me</i>

821
00:59:15,208 --> 00:59:17,250
Shoot lasers from your
eyes and blow him up!

822
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:21,458
<i>I took a step back</i>

823
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,333
<i>When I saw you smile</i>

824
00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:32,000
<i>I wove a hundred excuses to myself</i>

825
00:59:34,458 --> 00:59:36,958
<i>The world you knew is no more</i>

826
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:40,917
<i>It's just smoke all around</i>

827
00:59:41,375 --> 00:59:45,208
<i>Even I haven't found</i>

828
00:59:45,292 --> 00:59:48,542
<i>My blue sky as yet</i>

829
01:00:06,625 --> 01:00:08,250
Want to use the washroom?

830
01:00:08,792 --> 01:00:10,917
Can you walk on your own?

831
01:00:11,833 --> 01:00:13,625
Wait. I'll send someone over.

832
01:00:41,083 --> 01:00:42,083
Hey...

833
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:47,875
Wait a second.

834
01:01:01,458 --> 01:01:02,958
Hello, sir.

835
01:01:03,583 --> 01:01:04,542
One second.

836
01:01:04,917 --> 01:01:05,958
Where are you going?

837
01:01:08,583 --> 01:01:10,583
Just a second, listen to me.

838
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:13,458
I don't have any money.
Someone must have brought me here.

839
01:01:13,542 --> 01:01:14,625
Go ask him.

840
01:01:14,958 --> 01:01:16,292
You guys will keep me
here for a couple of weeks

841
01:01:16,417 --> 01:01:18,000
and then say I need to go for a scan.

842
01:01:18,083 --> 01:01:20,292
Then you'll say I have
a block here, liver failure.

843
01:01:20,583 --> 01:01:22,250
And overwhelm me with
all that stupid stuff.

844
01:01:22,625 --> 01:01:23,542
I...

845
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:25,792
I am absolutely fine. Let me go.

846
01:01:27,667 --> 01:01:31,000
Enough, I am absolutely fine. Let me go.

847
01:01:31,375 --> 01:01:33,583
You need vitamin C.

848
01:01:35,833 --> 01:01:37,500
Master... No!

849
01:01:38,167 --> 01:01:39,750
Sensei. Shifu...

850
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:41,250
Karate Man.

851
01:01:42,625 --> 01:01:45,792
It would be an honor to
be a part of your 100-Man Kumite.

852
01:01:46,292 --> 01:01:47,417
There he is, catch him.

853
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,917
Let it be. Let him go. Please

854
01:01:58,708 --> 01:01:59,917
Where do you think you're going?

855
01:02:02,042 --> 01:02:03,000
You, get lost.

856
01:02:03,208 --> 01:02:04,417
And what have you knocked
over from the hospital?

857
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:05,875
Nothing at all.

858
01:02:05,958 --> 01:02:08,958
Are you all going to gang
up on me for this cheap bandage?

859
01:02:09,042 --> 01:02:10,125
Catch him.

860
01:03:05,458 --> 01:03:06,833
Watch out!

861
01:03:09,917 --> 01:03:11,083
Let's go.

862
01:03:11,667 --> 01:03:13,208
Come on, let's get out of here.

863
01:03:17,125 --> 01:03:19,542
<i>Before Karate Man knows who I am...</i>

864
01:03:20,167 --> 01:03:23,833
<i>I think it's more important
to know who Karate Man is.</i>

865
01:03:23,917 --> 01:03:26,750
<i>Show me the Mani</i>

866
01:03:30,083 --> 01:03:32,833
<i>Give me the Jimmy</i>

867
01:03:39,708 --> 01:03:41,500
<i>Hello, mic testing... Hello</i>

868
01:03:41,917 --> 01:03:43,917
<i>Three... Two... One</i>

869
01:03:44,167 --> 01:03:45,917
<i>The story starts now</i>

870
01:03:48,625 --> 01:03:50,417
<i>Once upon a time...</i>

871
01:03:50,917 --> 01:03:54,208
<i>One fellow Mani,
And his twin brother Jimmy</i>

872
01:03:54,292 --> 01:03:55,917
<i>And then what happened</i>

873
01:03:56,542 --> 01:03:57,667
<i>Check it out</i>

874
01:03:57,750 --> 01:04:00,792
<i>Who gets a fair chance in life</i>

875
01:04:00,875 --> 01:04:03,792
<i>One takes whatever life throws at him</i>

876
01:04:03,875 --> 01:04:06,833
<i>Mani got Karate but Jimmy got swag too</i>

877
01:04:06,917 --> 01:04:09,542
<i>One loves Bruce Lee The other Scarface</i>

878
01:04:09,708 --> 01:04:12,875
<i>Good gets Limp Bizkit
And Bad gets to be Brat Pitt</i>

879
01:04:12,958 --> 01:04:15,583
<i>Who gets a fair chance in life</i>

880
01:04:33,583 --> 01:04:36,417
<i>Head or tails It's the same coin Brody</i>

881
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:40,042
<i>But Michael you keep calling Heads</i>

882
01:04:40,125 --> 01:04:41,375
<i>Since Nintendo 64...
Why has Michael been...</i>

883
01:04:41,458 --> 01:04:45,583
<i>Giving only Mani rides on Jimmy's cycle?</i>

884
01:04:45,667 --> 01:04:47,167
<i>The world wants to know</i>

885
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:48,792
<i>But the answer's same old</i>

886
01:04:48,875 --> 01:04:51,542
<i>Who gets a fair chance in life</i>

887
01:04:55,583 --> 01:04:56,833
MANI BEATS A HUNDRED MEN

888
01:05:05,333 --> 01:05:07,958
<i>One incident tipped The triple beam</i>

889
01:05:08,458 --> 01:05:10,917
<i>What happened to St. Mani?</i>

890
01:05:11,208 --> 01:05:14,125
<i>With Jimmy's girlfriend in bed
Mani made a Boo-Boo</i>

891
01:05:14,208 --> 01:05:16,833
<i>One Boo-Boo turned
The entire game on its head</i>

892
01:05:16,917 --> 01:05:20,292
<i>Jimmy's vengeance against Mani...</i>

893
01:05:20,375 --> 01:05:22,917
<i>Who gets a fair chance in life?</i>

894
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:41,292
<i>Karate Mani's guilt turned him
into a cliché drunk karate master.</i>

895
01:05:43,125 --> 01:05:45,083
<i>Jimmy's rage turned him into...</i>

896
01:05:45,333 --> 01:05:47,375
<i>a cliché psychotic villain.</i>

897
01:05:48,875 --> 01:05:53,083
<i>After that, whenever Jimmy met Mani,
he took something from him.</i>

898
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:55,708
<i>The least he did was to insult him.</i>

899
01:05:58,750 --> 01:05:59,625
<i>End Of Story</i>

900
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:32,125
Ever since I quit smoking

901
01:06:32,208 --> 01:06:34,875
I've put on weight because of overeating.

902
01:06:34,958 --> 01:06:37,167
Look what drinking soda has done to me.

903
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:43,042
You put up huge posters
for the 100-Man Fight.

904
01:06:44,708 --> 01:06:47,667
You posted it on Facebook too.
It got 22 likes. I liked it too.

905
01:06:48,667 --> 01:06:51,583
If you hold a small
demonstration here, I destroy it.

906
01:06:51,667 --> 01:06:53,792
How could you think of
organizing such a big event?

907
01:06:53,917 --> 01:06:56,000
If dad was alive,
he would've turned 80 today.

908
01:06:56,208 --> 01:06:59,250
I planned this to celebrate his birthday.
Let me do it.

909
01:06:59,583 --> 01:07:01,417
There's a saying in Mumbai...

910
01:07:02,083 --> 01:07:03,833
"Eyes off the Hood... Nuts off the sack."

911
01:07:04,667 --> 01:07:06,417
I shifted my attention from you

912
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:08,875
and you came up with such a huge plan.

913
01:07:08,958 --> 01:07:11,417
It's not for myself, I'm doing it for dad.

914
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:15,000
In fact I was planning to
ask you for some financial help.

915
01:07:15,083 --> 01:07:16,125
Damn!

916
01:07:16,958 --> 01:07:17,917
Worthless fellow.

917
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,167
Have some ego.

918
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,250
Where is she?

919
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:23,125
Hit Girl?

920
01:07:24,333 --> 01:07:26,792
She's the only real fighter here
the rest are...

921
01:07:27,375 --> 01:07:28,375
No, she isn't here.

922
01:07:28,625 --> 01:07:30,708
I told her not to come here anymore.

923
01:07:30,833 --> 01:07:32,750
Forget her. Don't harm her.

924
01:07:32,833 --> 01:07:33,750
Hey, Coach Carter.

925
01:07:34,708 --> 01:07:39,250
I don't need your permission
to kill or spare anyone.

926
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:44,875
Did you seek my permission
to dirty dance with my girlfriend?

927
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,417
Wait. Please.

928
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,833
Listen, they are here
on a month's free trial.

929
01:07:56,917 --> 01:07:59,042
If you beat them up,
they won't come next month.

930
01:07:59,167 --> 01:08:00,958
Why don't you just beat me up?

931
01:08:05,958 --> 01:08:09,833
Oh God!

932
01:08:09,917 --> 01:08:11,500
It's frustrating.

933
01:08:12,917 --> 01:08:14,167
Give me a cigarette.

934
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:37,667
Boss, you'd ordered...

935
01:08:37,792 --> 01:08:40,458
that if you ask for a cigarette
more than thrice a day...

936
01:08:40,792 --> 01:08:42,042
I should slap you.

937
01:08:46,208 --> 01:08:47,708
Once outside the airport.

938
01:08:48,333 --> 01:08:49,917
The second was after lunch.

939
01:08:50,167 --> 01:08:51,167
And now.

940
01:08:52,208 --> 01:08:54,667
I'd asked for chewing gum
outside the airport.

941
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:06,708
He's irritating me! Throw him out.

942
01:09:17,125 --> 01:09:19,625
<i>Show me the Mani</i>

943
01:09:22,958 --> 01:09:25,750
<i>Give me the Jimmy</i>

944
01:09:25,833 --> 01:09:26,708
Hey...

945
01:09:26,792 --> 01:09:28,792
Attack! Attack!

946
01:09:29,333 --> 01:09:30,250
Papa... Papa...

947
01:09:32,958 --> 01:09:34,333
Leave my brother.

948
01:09:36,583 --> 01:09:39,583
Jimmy! Return my locket.

949
01:09:42,667 --> 01:09:43,542
Jimmy.

950
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:47,917
Jimmy!

951
01:09:54,875 --> 01:09:58,792
I don't want to die like this.

952
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,542
I want to die a legend.

953
01:10:01,792 --> 01:10:03,875
After the 100-Man Fight.

954
01:10:03,958 --> 01:10:04,833
Sorry boss.

955
01:10:04,917 --> 01:10:07,417
You know 100-Man Kumite?

956
01:10:07,792 --> 01:10:09,375
I've seen your 100-Man Fight.

957
01:10:10,625 --> 01:10:12,667
I mean... On a video cassette.

958
01:10:13,167 --> 01:10:14,292
Video recording?

959
01:10:15,167 --> 01:10:19,125
Please give me that cassette.

960
01:10:19,208 --> 01:10:21,000
Jimmy broke my copy.

961
01:10:21,542 --> 01:10:22,542
Will you?

962
01:10:22,875 --> 01:10:25,500
Actually, it's completely fazed out now.

963
01:10:26,625 --> 01:10:28,083
Like me.

964
01:10:29,792 --> 01:10:31,333
But you're The Karate Man.

965
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
You can defeat 100 men

966
01:10:34,083 --> 01:10:36,333
so why do you let Jimmy beat you up?

967
01:10:37,542 --> 01:10:43,125
When my daughter was younger,
she used to call me Karate Man.

968
01:10:43,208 --> 01:10:44,708
She is you daughter!

969
01:10:45,375 --> 01:10:47,792
I found her on the street.

970
01:10:47,875 --> 01:10:50,250
You found your daughter on the street.

971
01:10:59,625 --> 01:11:02,250
Supri, you knew it was me, didn't you?

972
01:11:03,375 --> 01:11:04,417
Maybe.

973
01:11:04,542 --> 01:11:06,917
- Then why didn't you say it?
- Because I didn't want to meet you.

974
01:11:11,292 --> 01:11:12,417
But why not?

975
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:14,458
You don't get to decide
when it's time to disappear

976
01:11:14,542 --> 01:11:15,875
or when to show up again.

977
01:11:17,333 --> 01:11:19,583
Do you have any idea
how I spent all these years?

978
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,000
I was only thinking about you.

979
01:11:21,083 --> 01:11:23,208
You know what,
you can still keep thinking about me.

980
01:11:23,375 --> 01:11:25,333
- But now I have found you.
- I am leaving.

981
01:11:25,458 --> 01:11:27,083
- What do you mean you're leaving?
- Get lost.

982
01:11:27,167 --> 01:11:29,208
- Why should I?
- Just stay mute for a moment at least.

983
01:11:29,708 --> 01:11:31,000
Why did Master run away from the hospital?

984
01:11:31,792 --> 01:11:33,500
Are you asking me to leave
or are you leaving yourself?

985
01:11:33,583 --> 01:11:35,042
- You have me confused...
- Surya, will you keep quiet?

986
01:11:35,125 --> 01:11:36,250
Don't irritate me.

987
01:11:52,375 --> 01:11:53,875
Inspector Kumar.

988
01:11:58,625 --> 01:12:01,167
un, dos, tres, Kaboom!

989
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,750
Supri, I mean...

990
01:12:07,125 --> 01:12:11,500
You're getting personally
trained by Karate Man himself.

991
01:12:11,583 --> 01:12:14,792
He's not Karate Man.
He's just Master Mani.

992
01:12:15,542 --> 01:12:18,292
He's a nice man.

993
01:12:18,375 --> 01:12:21,458
He's the Karate Man. The real deal.

994
01:12:22,292 --> 01:12:23,667
What are you saying?

995
01:12:23,958 --> 01:12:25,792
How can you behave so casually?

996
01:12:27,542 --> 01:12:30,917
I've so many questions for you, I mean...

997
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,500
I don't have any answers.

998
01:12:33,625 --> 01:12:35,125
Let me ask them at least.

999
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:37,458
Your father.

1000
01:12:39,667 --> 01:12:40,708
Alive.

1001
01:12:42,667 --> 01:12:43,542
Mother?

1002
01:12:48,125 --> 01:12:49,250
And that guy?

1003
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:51,625
Surya, I am leaving.

1004
01:12:51,708 --> 01:12:52,542
Where?

1005
01:12:53,167 --> 01:12:54,000
Canada.

1006
01:12:54,917 --> 01:12:56,375
With that All Time Unhappy Lad.

1007
01:12:56,458 --> 01:12:57,417
Huh!

1008
01:12:58,583 --> 01:13:02,458
A-T-U-L

1009
01:13:05,625 --> 01:13:08,083
I don't have the bandwidth
to update the last 12 years.

1010
01:13:11,792 --> 01:13:14,625
The way I saw him drag you
it made me so angry...

1011
01:13:14,708 --> 01:13:18,417
I wanted to turn him
to ashes with my laser beams.

1012
01:13:19,833 --> 01:13:22,083
You still talk like that?

1013
01:13:23,667 --> 01:13:25,333
Surya, grow up.

1014
01:13:25,875 --> 01:13:28,042
- What?
- Grow up?

1015
01:13:29,208 --> 01:13:30,250
What grow up?

1016
01:13:31,083 --> 01:13:33,792
You can beat me up twice...

1017
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:36,833
but it's okay for him
to treat you like that.

1018
01:13:39,625 --> 01:13:40,458
Supri.

1019
01:13:42,375 --> 01:13:43,667
Nothing has changed.

1020
01:13:44,042 --> 01:13:47,625
Someone's dragging you away,
and you're doing nothing.

1021
01:13:49,083 --> 01:13:50,292
Why did you come back?

1022
01:13:54,792 --> 01:13:56,792
You know why I came back, Supri...

1023
01:14:01,833 --> 01:14:05,000
Supri, don't make me cry.

1024
01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:09,583
If I cry, I'll get dehydrated.

1025
01:14:11,542 --> 01:14:13,208
And one should always keep drinking water.

1026
01:14:13,292 --> 01:14:17,875
Look Surya, please don't think your
words will make me discover the real me.

1027
01:14:18,167 --> 01:14:21,042
I am leaving and we're not
going to have an airport scene.

1028
01:14:21,208 --> 01:14:22,375
Get that straight.

1029
01:14:22,667 --> 01:14:24,667
Then why didn't you tell Karate Man?

1030
01:14:25,250 --> 01:14:28,250
He knows... He has clearly
said I shouldn't come here anymore.

1031
01:14:28,333 --> 01:14:29,833
He'll scream at me when he gets up.

1032
01:14:29,917 --> 01:14:32,125
Why? Because he's scared of Jimmy.

1033
01:14:32,708 --> 01:14:34,000
And you are too?

1034
01:14:34,792 --> 01:14:36,792
Then why were you sticking those posters?

1035
01:14:43,833 --> 01:14:45,750
Supri...

1036
01:14:47,625 --> 01:14:50,333
Someone snatched Karate Man's locket,
doesn't that mean anything?

1037
01:14:51,542 --> 01:14:54,250
His dream of a 100-Man Fight was
shattered, doesn't that mean anything?

1038
01:14:54,958 --> 01:14:57,500
Remember we set out
to nab the chain-snatchers.

1039
01:14:57,708 --> 01:14:59,583
- And this chain-snatcher...
- Are you crazy, Surya?

1040
01:14:59,667 --> 01:15:00,792
Do you know what you're saying?

1041
01:15:00,875 --> 01:15:02,917
- Why did you fight for that girl?
- That was different.

1042
01:15:03,875 --> 01:15:05,958
How is it different? You're a coward.

1043
01:15:06,625 --> 01:15:08,958
We're not in school anymore
to play the "you are a coward" game.

1044
01:15:09,125 --> 01:15:10,625
This is how it is. This is life.

1045
01:15:10,708 --> 01:15:13,000
And I don't have an explanation,
or any answers for you.

1046
01:15:13,083 --> 01:15:14,167
I am sorry.

1047
01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:15,917
I can't let another chain-snatcher
escape my clutches

1048
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,125
just so that I can be normal.

1049
01:15:20,167 --> 01:15:23,667
<i>For me, you're still...</i>

1050
01:15:24,083 --> 01:15:27,958
<i>That story I used to hear as a kid</i>

1051
01:15:28,042 --> 01:15:34,667
<i>I've kept those stories safe... Forever</i>

1052
01:15:35,292 --> 01:15:36,625
Hey... Tender Marlon Brando.

1053
01:15:37,083 --> 01:15:38,500
She said she's leaving.

1054
01:15:38,708 --> 01:15:40,667
Let her go. Get lost from here.

1055
01:15:41,958 --> 01:15:43,542
Very soon you'll read in the news

1056
01:15:43,625 --> 01:15:48,292
that a masked Ninja has
cleansed this city of all evil...

1057
01:15:48,875 --> 01:15:50,833
Hey Indie Avenger, don't make me angry.

1058
01:15:50,917 --> 01:15:52,083
Stop irritating me,

1059
01:15:52,250 --> 01:15:53,833
I'll curse you.

1060
01:15:53,917 --> 01:15:57,708
<i>Forever seems like too much to ask for</i>

1061
01:15:57,875 --> 01:16:01,500
<i>I am sorry, I don't dream at all now</i>

1062
01:16:01,708 --> 01:16:05,750
<i>Yet your eyes somehow find a way</i>

1063
01:16:05,833 --> 01:16:09,167
<i>To peek into mine</i>

1064
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:19,750
<i>Gradually...</i>

1065
01:16:19,833 --> 01:16:24,833
<i>My world's entered a void</i>

1066
01:16:25,083 --> 01:16:29,292
<i>And my voyage</i>

1067
01:16:29,375 --> 01:16:32,750
<i>Has asked for a time-out</i>

1068
01:16:44,583 --> 01:16:47,042
As per Canadian child benefit program...

1069
01:16:47,375 --> 01:16:50,417
families with children
under the age group of six...

1070
01:16:50,708 --> 01:16:56,250
will receive as much as
6400 dollars per child, per year.

1071
01:16:56,667 --> 01:16:57,625
And listen...

1072
01:16:58,333 --> 01:17:02,083
For kids between six... And seventeen.

1073
01:17:02,667 --> 01:17:04,708
- Where are you going?
- There's been an accident.

1074
01:17:04,792 --> 01:17:07,250
- They might need some help.
- Have your food first.

1075
01:17:09,792 --> 01:17:10,792
Have your food.

1076
01:17:12,958 --> 01:17:14,958
Why are you the only one to see all this?

1077
01:17:18,125 --> 01:17:19,958
Supri, why do you trouble everyone?

1078
01:17:20,708 --> 01:17:23,333
Atul, if you feel like, you can slap her.

1079
01:17:24,167 --> 01:17:25,958
That's how I fixed her when she was a kid.

1080
01:17:27,125 --> 01:17:28,208
Finish your food.

1081
01:17:34,708 --> 01:17:35,667
Supri.

1082
01:17:37,042 --> 01:17:38,542
Why are you doing all this?

1083
01:17:39,833 --> 01:17:40,833
Shut up.

1084
01:17:41,333 --> 01:17:43,125
You can ask me to shut up.

1085
01:17:47,292 --> 01:17:49,875
Did you ever tell your husband to shut up?

1086
01:17:52,333 --> 01:17:54,667
When he was fine, he abused you.

1087
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:58,667
When he was sick,
you nursed him back to health.

1088
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,583
Made him fit enough to stand again.

1089
01:18:01,167 --> 01:18:02,042
Why?

1090
01:18:04,792 --> 01:18:07,042
You can't be the only one
to make sacrifices.

1091
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:10,792
That was a different time.
That time has passed.

1092
01:18:10,875 --> 01:18:14,542
But you can be a little selfish,
dear. Honestly.

1093
01:18:15,208 --> 01:18:16,542
You run away.

1094
01:18:18,125 --> 01:18:21,083
Later, you would never
know where to stop or say no.

1095
01:18:23,083 --> 01:18:26,125
- Come on, two more rounds to go...
- No, I don't want to go anywhere.

1096
01:18:26,208 --> 01:18:27,625
What? Let's go.

1097
01:18:33,708 --> 01:18:36,125
Mom, I don't earn a penny.

1098
01:18:37,292 --> 01:18:38,875
And I don't know what to do with my life.

1099
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,667
Well, that's still in the future.

1100
01:18:40,917 --> 01:18:42,667
But we need the money right now.

1101
01:18:43,917 --> 01:18:46,042
Do we need it or not?

1102
01:18:52,333 --> 01:18:55,667
You know, guys my age are so smart.

1103
01:18:56,208 --> 01:18:58,708
Everybody knows what they
want to do with their lives and...

1104
01:18:59,750 --> 01:19:01,542
I have no idea.

1105
01:19:03,042 --> 01:19:03,917
I...

1106
01:19:05,625 --> 01:19:07,875
And it's not like I
didn't give it a thought.

1107
01:19:08,708 --> 01:19:11,500
But I don't have any clue. I am blank.

1108
01:19:12,167 --> 01:19:13,042
Everybody knows.

1109
01:19:13,125 --> 01:19:14,875
Someone's studying to be a doctor,
or going to the US

1110
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,542
or building an App, but...

1111
01:19:18,917 --> 01:19:22,375
Or maybe I am just dumb. I don't know.

1112
01:19:26,583 --> 01:19:27,583
Mom.

1113
01:19:28,667 --> 01:19:29,542
I am nobody.

1114
01:19:29,625 --> 01:19:31,625
You sound like a grandma.

1115
01:19:31,708 --> 01:19:33,417
You're just 21,
you've your whole life ahead of you.

1116
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:34,417
Let's go.

1117
01:19:37,708 --> 01:19:39,958
You know people become
millionaires at the age of 21.

1118
01:19:40,042 --> 01:19:40,917
So what?

1119
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,792
That too from scratch, okay. From scratch.

1120
01:19:44,542 --> 01:19:46,667
I mean people my age...

1121
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,458
have 20 million followers on Twitter.

1122
01:19:48,542 --> 01:19:49,375
Eww...

1123
01:19:52,417 --> 01:19:54,125
Did you notice my look?

1124
01:19:54,333 --> 01:19:56,292
It's the Iron Man look. Her choice.

1125
01:19:56,375 --> 01:19:58,167
The goggles, and everything.
Even the beard.

1126
01:19:58,250 --> 01:20:01,500
I was thinking about Johnny Depp,
like Jack Sparrow.

1127
01:20:01,583 --> 01:20:02,667
Surya...

1128
01:20:02,750 --> 01:20:05,500
Are you really going
to wander out donning a mask?

1129
01:20:05,875 --> 01:20:09,250
I don't like bad jokes.

1130
01:20:15,792 --> 01:20:18,167
What happened? Aren't you excited?

1131
01:20:20,667 --> 01:20:23,208
- Are you scared?
- Why will I be scared?

1132
01:20:23,875 --> 01:20:27,625
When the doctors said you won't
survive for more than four years...

1133
01:20:27,708 --> 01:20:30,875
- I wasn't scared then.
- Where's that Sampat and that foreigner?

1134
01:20:31,042 --> 01:20:32,875
It's our turn. We're next.

1135
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,250
Surya, come.

1136
01:20:34,375 --> 01:20:35,375
We're next.

1137
01:20:42,625 --> 01:20:45,167
Listen...

1138
01:20:49,417 --> 01:20:53,875
The Karate man's brother stole his locket.

1139
01:20:54,333 --> 01:20:56,833
So those two should settle
it between themselves.

1140
01:20:57,958 --> 01:21:00,583
Why are you so excited?

1141
01:21:00,667 --> 01:21:01,792
Let them handle it.

1142
01:21:01,875 --> 01:21:02,792
Meaning?

1143
01:21:03,708 --> 01:21:06,000
Weren't you going to fight
for the country with Netaji?

1144
01:21:07,208 --> 01:21:12,167
That's between Netaji and me.

1145
01:21:12,458 --> 01:21:13,583
This is different.

1146
01:21:13,708 --> 01:21:15,667
That's different, this is different.

1147
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
- Different?
- Yes.

1148
01:21:18,708 --> 01:21:21,292
Is that why you let
mom's chain-snatcher go?

1149
01:21:22,083 --> 01:21:23,125
Different.

1150
01:21:23,792 --> 01:21:25,042
That's different, this is different.

1151
01:21:25,333 --> 01:21:28,583
Surya, Father.
What are you two doing there?

1152
01:21:28,792 --> 01:21:30,000
Come on, it's our turn now.

1153
01:21:42,708 --> 01:21:48,583
I, Jatin Sampat,
take Bridget Von Hammersmark

1154
01:21:48,667 --> 01:21:52,958
Nandini as my lawfully wedded wife.

1155
01:21:53,708 --> 01:21:59,500
I, Bridget Von Hammersmark, take Jatin
Y Sampat as my lawfully wedded husband.

1156
01:22:04,083 --> 01:22:06,250
Ma'am. One selfie.

1157
01:22:06,833 --> 01:22:09,708
Brother, take one with me.

1158
01:22:10,167 --> 01:22:11,250
I'm a foreigner too.

1159
01:22:11,333 --> 01:22:13,208
I am Jatin Stark! Come on.

1160
01:22:14,083 --> 01:22:15,417
What is your focus in life?

1161
01:22:16,083 --> 01:22:16,917
What is your focus?

1162
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,208
You want to be like Karate Man,
then go ahead.

1163
01:22:18,292 --> 01:22:19,125
Become a Karate Master.

1164
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:21,375
Grand Master Surya.

1165
01:22:21,583 --> 01:22:24,208
Surya, you make your documentary.

1166
01:22:24,375 --> 01:22:25,292
Take it to film festivals.

1167
01:22:25,667 --> 01:22:27,000
Be adventurous. Adventurous.

1168
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:28,667
Go to Germany, go to Japan.

1169
01:22:31,375 --> 01:22:34,958
Grandpa, you were born in 1941.

1170
01:22:35,792 --> 01:22:37,875
Netaji died in 1945.

1171
01:22:38,583 --> 01:22:39,833
At least officially.

1172
01:22:41,333 --> 01:22:45,625
So at the age of four, you traveled
to Japan, Germany, etcetera.

1173
01:22:46,917 --> 01:22:47,833
You didn't, did you?

1174
01:22:51,125 --> 01:22:52,375
I am not dumb.

1175
01:22:54,333 --> 01:22:56,042
They might be some stories for you...

1176
01:22:57,167 --> 01:22:58,875
but those were facts for me.

1177
01:22:59,583 --> 01:23:01,167
Like you always said...

1178
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:04,625
Behind every mind-blowing story
are some pretty bad decision.

1179
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:07,250
When did I ever say that?

1180
01:23:07,333 --> 01:23:08,625
You must have said it.

1181
01:23:09,208 --> 01:23:11,250
I speak too much.

1182
01:23:12,083 --> 01:23:13,000
You are right.

1183
01:23:19,542 --> 01:23:22,583
I told you that I don't
want to see Supri around.

1184
01:23:22,708 --> 01:23:24,250
Then how did she come here?

1185
01:23:24,708 --> 01:23:27,833
Who told her that I am
organizing a 100-Man Fight?

1186
01:23:27,917 --> 01:23:30,458
She keeps a tab on you. She knows.

1187
01:23:30,542 --> 01:23:31,417
Stupid Girl.

1188
01:23:34,333 --> 01:23:36,167
The important point is...

1189
01:23:36,667 --> 01:23:40,042
in the first four years
we don't have to show...

1190
01:23:40,292 --> 01:23:42,500
that we're earning
more than 25,000 dollars.

1191
01:23:44,333 --> 01:23:45,708
We'll have to observe a little restraint.

1192
01:23:47,708 --> 01:23:48,708
Did you break it?

1193
01:23:48,792 --> 01:23:50,208
Who are you waiting for, Mani?

1194
01:23:52,083 --> 01:23:57,583
If at least 20 people show up,
we can organize a small event.

1195
01:23:58,417 --> 01:23:59,417
Twenty people?

1196
01:24:00,958 --> 01:24:01,917
They will come.

1197
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:04,625
Hello, where's your bindi?

1198
01:24:05,208 --> 01:24:07,083
And, take your shades off.
We're inside now.

1199
01:24:07,625 --> 01:24:08,625
Sorry.

1200
01:24:14,625 --> 01:24:15,583
Better.

1201
01:24:15,708 --> 01:24:17,208
- Excuse me ma'am.
- Go, go, they are calling you.

1202
01:24:17,333 --> 01:24:18,625
- Come forward.
- Go, go.

1203
01:24:22,792 --> 01:24:24,833
Will you stick around when they bury me?

1204
01:24:25,417 --> 01:24:27,875
Of course. I'll perform your final rites.

1205
01:24:28,042 --> 01:24:33,208
Okay... Please request
Jimmy and get my locket back.

1206
01:24:33,333 --> 01:24:36,250
And tie it around my neck
when they put me in the coffin.

1207
01:24:36,333 --> 01:24:38,708
When I meet father in heaven...

1208
01:24:39,458 --> 01:24:42,250
I'll have this feeling
that I saved one of his legacies.

1209
01:24:42,375 --> 01:24:43,833
Is it really that expensive?

1210
01:24:44,583 --> 01:24:46,292
We'll get a duplicate made.

1211
01:24:49,042 --> 01:24:50,333
It will look exactly like the original.

1212
01:24:50,708 --> 01:24:51,625
Father will be happy too.

1213
01:24:56,250 --> 01:24:57,625
Someone's here.

1214
01:24:58,250 --> 01:24:59,917
Use the back door.

1215
01:25:03,792 --> 01:25:05,500
After all someone did come.

1216
01:25:28,167 --> 01:25:29,833
I've seen you somewhere.

1217
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,500
Indie Avenger!

1218
01:25:35,458 --> 01:25:36,500
Let's go.

1219
01:25:40,958 --> 01:25:42,750
Let's go and get your locket back.

1220
01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:46,833
You can come if you feel like,
or stay here.

1221
01:25:47,875 --> 01:25:49,292
Give me Jimmy's address.

1222
01:25:50,750 --> 01:25:51,833
Give it.

1223
01:25:53,250 --> 01:25:56,000
Fine, I'll find it myself.

1224
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,083
Hey...

1225
01:26:00,208 --> 01:26:01,250
Hey...

1226
01:26:06,375 --> 01:26:08,042
- Where's my shoe?
- There.

1227
01:26:21,708 --> 01:26:23,292
<i>I am tired</i>

1228
01:26:28,667 --> 01:26:29,833
<i>Ground floor.</i>

1229
01:26:34,167 --> 01:26:37,417
<i>Hello, Friends.
Jimmy from Jimmy Security Services.</i>

1230
01:26:38,292 --> 01:26:41,458
<i>Our Security firm has handpicked
fighters from Vietnam.</i>

1231
01:26:41,875 --> 01:26:43,542
<i>We've boxers from Rome.</i>

1232
01:26:44,042 --> 01:26:45,833
<i>All 100 percent genuine fighters.</i>

1233
01:26:45,917 --> 01:26:47,125
<i>All very flexible.</i>

1234
01:26:47,542 --> 01:26:49,792
<i>My fighter, they move like a cat.</i>

1235
01:26:50,083 --> 01:26:52,583
<i>They listen like a dog,
they pull like a bull.</i>

1236
01:26:52,667 --> 01:26:55,875
<i>Think like a fox and
they attack like a tiger.</i>

1237
01:26:55,958 --> 01:26:58,875
<i>We've really deadly fighters
from North Korea, Georgia.</i>

1238
01:26:59,083 --> 01:27:02,083
Did you hurt your head
when you were a kid...

1239
01:27:04,333 --> 01:27:06,083
or maybe you have
some other medical issue?

1240
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:09,167
You have some kind of problem.

1241
01:27:11,458 --> 01:27:14,917
We are at Jimmy's
to get Master's chain back.

1242
01:27:15,833 --> 01:27:16,833
Supri...

1243
01:27:18,583 --> 01:27:19,750
Run away!

1244
01:27:21,083 --> 01:27:22,000
Okay.

1245
01:27:22,083 --> 01:27:23,375
Seriously!

1246
01:27:24,750 --> 01:27:27,375
Look, you're worried because...

1247
01:27:27,458 --> 01:27:29,958
if you're not around
Atul won't pay for my treatment.

1248
01:27:30,333 --> 01:27:31,333
Isn't it?

1249
01:27:31,750 --> 01:27:32,917
- What?
- Yes.

1250
01:27:33,333 --> 01:27:34,625
I am not going anywhere, please.

1251
01:27:34,708 --> 01:27:36,625
Supri, this is your best chance to escape.

1252
01:27:36,833 --> 01:27:39,125
Look, soon they will announce boarding...

1253
01:27:39,542 --> 01:27:41,458
we'll all go in and you can escape.

1254
01:27:41,708 --> 01:27:43,583
What are you saying, Mom?

1255
01:27:43,667 --> 01:27:44,875
Shut up and listen to me.

1256
01:27:45,083 --> 01:27:46,208
We will all go inside.

1257
01:27:46,583 --> 01:27:51,042
If anyone asks me, where's Supri,
I'll say she's in the toilet.

1258
01:27:51,125 --> 01:27:51,958
Toilet.

1259
01:27:52,042 --> 01:27:53,750
Soon the plane will take off
and we'll be in Canada.

1260
01:27:53,833 --> 01:27:55,250
Canada... How...

1261
01:27:55,333 --> 01:27:57,000
- What are you saying...
- Listen to me.

1262
01:27:57,583 --> 01:28:00,708
Once we land,
I'll take a big dose of Insulin.

1263
01:28:00,792 --> 01:28:01,792
Insulin?

1264
01:28:01,875 --> 01:28:04,625
I am carrying insulin. Listen to me.

1265
01:28:05,458 --> 01:28:08,917
Once I take insulin,
my sugar level will drop drastically.

1266
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:11,167
And we'll have to go
straight to the hospital.

1267
01:28:11,833 --> 01:28:13,833
Once we're at the hospital,
they'll have to get me treated.

1268
01:28:13,917 --> 01:28:16,792
I have figured it out, don't worry, Supri.

1269
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:19,208
- What are you saying?
- Supri!

1270
01:28:23,125 --> 01:28:27,458
You keep asking me why I take
care of that man who always abused me.

1271
01:28:28,833 --> 01:28:30,500
I don't know why I am like this.

1272
01:28:31,875 --> 01:28:35,000
I don't believe in this whole
'my husband's my god' concept.

1273
01:28:35,292 --> 01:28:37,208
But it's etched in our minds...

1274
01:28:37,708 --> 01:28:39,958
And I am not trying to make
a sacrifice. This is how I am.

1275
01:28:41,708 --> 01:28:43,042
Now do you understand?

1276
01:28:43,583 --> 01:28:46,250
Mom, Insulin, big dose...
what are you talking about...

1277
01:28:46,833 --> 01:28:47,792
Hold on.

1278
01:28:48,167 --> 01:28:49,750
Careful.

1279
01:28:53,042 --> 01:28:54,458
Sir I am almost there.

1280
01:28:56,958 --> 01:28:57,875
Listen up.

1281
01:28:58,208 --> 01:29:00,875
<i>I have a spot free for a night-watchman.
You can take it up if you like.</i>

1282
01:29:01,375 --> 01:29:02,542
Return my locket.

1283
01:29:04,792 --> 01:29:06,000
Who is that next to you?

1284
01:29:08,708 --> 01:29:09,750
Surya!

1285
01:29:10,292 --> 01:29:14,042
I don't talk to people with monkey
caps and sweaters in the Mumbai heat.

1286
01:29:14,750 --> 01:29:16,167
This is not a monkey cap.

1287
01:29:16,667 --> 01:29:17,583
Please tell him...

1288
01:29:17,667 --> 01:29:21,083
Why are you toying with my feelings?

1289
01:29:21,792 --> 01:29:24,083
Father's locket...
Father gave that locket to me.

1290
01:29:24,167 --> 01:29:26,458
You're a Tom Hank's fan,
that's why you are always crying.

1291
01:29:26,542 --> 01:29:28,167
With this beard and all.
You should've been a Vin Diesel fan.

1292
01:29:28,250 --> 01:29:30,417
Father didn't give it to you,
he gave it to me.

1293
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:32,833
Why are you humiliating me?

1294
01:29:44,125 --> 01:29:45,917
Supri, don't think too hard.

1295
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,583
If you think too hard, you'll
start seeing the logic in the plan.

1296
01:29:56,833 --> 01:29:58,542
Supri. Give me your phone.

1297
01:29:58,833 --> 01:30:00,000
Give me your phone.

1298
01:30:00,083 --> 01:30:02,458
- I'm so sorry... Sorry.
- What are you doing?

1299
01:30:02,542 --> 01:30:04,417
- I'll go get some tissues.
- It's fine.

1300
01:30:04,625 --> 01:30:05,500
Get it quickly.

1301
01:30:05,583 --> 01:30:06,750
- That must be hot.
- No, no, I am fine.

1302
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:44,250
<i>Twelfth floor.</i>

1303
01:31:00,458 --> 01:31:01,958
Where's the spelling mistake? Show me.

1304
01:31:02,042 --> 01:31:03,958
Conveyance starts with a C.

1305
01:31:04,042 --> 01:31:06,042
You tell me the spelling of 'Conveyance'.

1306
01:31:06,125 --> 01:31:07,000
Tell me.

1307
01:31:47,833 --> 01:31:48,750
Five times...

1308
01:31:48,833 --> 01:31:51,042
Five times I had to fill
the conveyance invoice form.

1309
01:31:51,125 --> 01:31:52,542
Now you tell me the
spelling of 'Conveyance'.

1310
01:31:52,625 --> 01:31:54,042
It wasn't me.

1311
01:31:56,333 --> 01:31:57,708
Tell me the spelling of 'Conveyance'.

1312
01:31:59,917 --> 01:32:02,375
It wasn't me, it was them.

1313
01:32:02,958 --> 01:32:04,750
What is all this nonsense!

1314
01:32:04,833 --> 01:32:05,667
Get out.

1315
01:32:06,708 --> 01:32:09,625
Are they really going
to start a fight inside?

1316
01:32:16,417 --> 01:32:17,375
Cheap furniture.

1317
01:32:17,875 --> 01:32:19,333
Don't buy from there again.

1318
01:32:19,417 --> 01:32:20,333
I had warned them.

1319
01:32:22,542 --> 01:32:23,417
Blood Ouch!

1320
01:32:26,542 --> 01:32:28,500
Hey...

1321
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:32,875
Useless fellow.

1322
01:33:07,042 --> 01:33:08,167
<i>Twelfth floor.</i>

1323
01:33:08,667 --> 01:33:10,625
- What the hell is happening?
- Come on, hurry up.

1324
01:33:13,417 --> 01:33:14,583
What are you doing here?

1325
01:33:14,750 --> 01:33:16,375
You're the security guy. Go and fight.

1326
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:17,875
I have diabetes.

1327
01:34:04,792 --> 01:34:06,875
- Give me the gun.
- No.

1328
01:34:06,958 --> 01:34:08,500
- Give it.
- Do you have an approval?

1329
01:34:08,583 --> 01:34:09,458
Give me the gun.

1330
01:34:09,542 --> 01:34:10,875
- Do you have authorization?
- Please give me the gun.

1331
01:34:10,958 --> 01:34:11,833
No.

1332
01:34:14,833 --> 01:34:16,875
Let's go. I admit you're a good fighter.

1333
01:34:16,958 --> 01:34:17,958
Let's go.

1334
01:34:23,792 --> 01:34:25,625
Sir, please come down quickly.

1335
01:34:25,708 --> 01:34:27,583
A mob is creating a ruckus here.

1336
01:34:27,667 --> 01:34:30,000
I beat up the rest, only two remain.

1337
01:34:30,083 --> 01:34:31,250
But they are very dangerous.

1338
01:34:48,792 --> 01:34:49,708
What's going on?

1339
01:35:17,917 --> 01:35:19,083
Here comes the shooter.

1340
01:35:22,042 --> 01:35:23,750
See, Old Man is not giving the gun.

1341
01:35:24,708 --> 01:35:27,000
If there was a mob attack here,
why didn't you give them the gun?

1342
01:35:27,083 --> 01:35:28,375
Only two.

1343
01:35:28,958 --> 01:35:31,625
One-legged Mani, and a kid.

1344
01:35:38,750 --> 01:35:40,042
Colonel, give me the gun.

1345
01:35:40,542 --> 01:35:44,875
Vendor Registration,
and an Advance Cheque.

1346
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Madam sign here please.

1347
01:35:49,250 --> 01:35:51,667
Madam... Madam...

1348
01:35:56,792 --> 01:35:59,708
Colonel, give me the gun, please.

1349
01:36:00,292 --> 01:36:02,125
Fill out the form and take it.

1350
01:36:12,833 --> 01:36:17,250
Page 33, article THX 1138 4EB.

1351
01:36:18,125 --> 01:36:19,167
Give me the gun.

1352
01:36:19,917 --> 01:36:21,625
Okay, you're right.

1353
01:36:22,292 --> 01:36:25,833
<i>Who labeled you a superstar</i>

1354
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:29,375
<i>Who labeled you a superstar</i>

1355
01:36:31,917 --> 01:36:33,833
<i>Do you know who my father is</i>

1356
01:36:34,417 --> 01:36:35,958
<i>Neither long coat, nor a big car</i>

1357
01:36:36,042 --> 01:36:38,458
<i>The commotion is always on
The opposite side of where you are</i>

1358
01:36:38,542 --> 01:36:40,708
<i>Even the hits are Tired of being missed</i>

1359
01:36:40,792 --> 01:36:43,292
<i>Who labeled you a superstar</i>

1360
01:36:44,542 --> 01:36:46,958
<i>Who labeled you a superstar</i>

1361
01:36:49,917 --> 01:36:51,750
I would have never missed.

1362
01:36:58,708 --> 01:36:59,833
Do we have insurance?

1363
01:36:59,917 --> 01:37:01,458
- Yes.
- <i>Who labeled you a superstar</i>

1364
01:37:04,792 --> 01:37:07,542
<i>Who labeled you a superstar</i>

1365
01:37:42,917 --> 01:37:44,375
<i>Do you know who my father is</i>

1366
01:37:44,458 --> 01:37:46,083
Yes.

1367
01:37:50,958 --> 01:37:52,000
The other lift.

1368
01:38:17,125 --> 01:38:19,542
Sir, the lift's shut.

1369
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,208
The fire exit's that way.

1370
01:38:55,208 --> 01:39:02,208
<i>I took a step towards you...</i>

1371
01:39:02,583 --> 01:39:04,458
<i>Whether you come to me or not</i>

1372
01:39:04,667 --> 01:39:10,875
<i>But my arms are open for you, forever</i>

1373
01:39:13,250 --> 01:39:15,083
Hey, you two run away.

1374
01:39:15,292 --> 01:39:16,292
Get out. Run.

1375
01:41:24,167 --> 01:41:25,958
- Are you okay?
- I am okay.

1376
01:41:26,042 --> 01:41:28,542
- Are you hurt here?
- I am okay!

1377
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:06,500
<i>Before I get dehydrated
and fall like a log...</i>

1378
01:42:06,625 --> 01:42:08,500
<i>I thought I'll drink some water first.</i>

1379
01:42:09,500 --> 01:42:10,708
<i>Supri was shocked.</i>

1380
01:42:11,708 --> 01:42:12,667
<i>But this man took</i>

1381
01:42:12,750 --> 01:42:14,708
<i>a mind-blowing
advantage of the water break.</i>

1382
01:42:14,958 --> 01:42:17,583
<i>Who labeled you a superstar</i>

1383
01:42:18,792 --> 01:42:21,292
<i>Who labeled you a superstar</i>

1384
01:43:13,750 --> 01:43:15,500
<i>Then we rented a sports car.</i>

1385
01:43:16,417 --> 01:43:18,250
<i>And went to the nearest hill station.</i>

1386
01:43:19,042 --> 01:43:22,333
<i>But nothing like that happened either.
We had to crawl down.</i>

1387
01:43:23,542 --> 01:43:26,125
<i>Got on a truck and escaped.</i>

1388
01:43:31,958 --> 01:43:34,000
Hey... Shooter!

1389
01:43:34,292 --> 01:43:36,292
Will Jimmy and the police be after us?

1390
01:43:36,375 --> 01:43:38,042
Jimmy won't go to the police.

1391
01:43:38,542 --> 01:43:39,958
He will come after us.

1392
01:43:40,042 --> 01:43:41,458
Why won't we go to the police?

1393
01:43:41,542 --> 01:43:43,542
And what will we tell them?

1394
01:43:43,625 --> 01:43:45,250
That we burnt down that office.

1395
01:43:45,833 --> 01:43:47,125
But why are we running?

1396
01:43:49,208 --> 01:43:50,750
He still has the locket.

1397
01:43:51,333 --> 01:43:52,167
Let's go get him.

1398
01:43:52,250 --> 01:43:53,708
Hey Mumblecore Justice League.

1399
01:43:53,792 --> 01:43:54,750
'Let's go get him!'

1400
01:43:55,250 --> 01:43:58,167
I want to see my entire staff here,
tomorrow.

1401
01:43:59,292 --> 01:44:02,250
Anyone who doesn't show up
will never be seen again, anywhere.

1402
01:44:03,333 --> 01:44:04,458
I hope you won't miss that.

1403
01:44:06,500 --> 01:44:07,625
- Jimmy.
- Run!

1404
01:44:07,708 --> 01:44:08,708
Good Lord!

1405
01:44:17,958 --> 01:44:21,833
I can't believe my brother did this.

1406
01:44:22,917 --> 01:44:24,833
Now we can kill him. I'll kill him.

1407
01:44:25,292 --> 01:44:27,292
You don't interfere. I will kill him.

1408
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:30,458
I won't... I am hanging up.

1409
01:44:30,542 --> 01:44:32,667
Stop crying. I am switching it off.

1410
01:44:32,750 --> 01:44:33,625
Bye.

1411
01:44:35,667 --> 01:44:38,833
Pablo is crying over
the phone because he left us.

1412
01:44:45,125 --> 01:44:46,042
Why did you text me?

1413
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:50,208
It was sent automatically.

1414
01:44:50,833 --> 01:44:52,125
Did your comic fantasy come true?

1415
01:44:53,375 --> 01:44:54,375
Was it amazing?

1416
01:44:54,917 --> 01:44:55,917
When you were a kid...

1417
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:59,833
you kicked a man off our building's
terrace, because of this Karate Man.

1418
01:45:00,542 --> 01:45:01,833
This time you burned
down an entire building.

1419
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:04,667
Look, man... Sorry. Sorry.

1420
01:45:06,958 --> 01:45:10,625
You've had quite an impact
on our lives even before he met you.

1421
01:45:10,708 --> 01:45:13,083
Leave it, Grandpa... You're just...

1422
01:45:13,625 --> 01:45:14,750
Grandpa, what did you tell father?

1423
01:45:14,833 --> 01:45:16,083
What will I tell him?
I told him jack squat.

1424
01:45:16,167 --> 01:45:18,125
Look... Your father.

1425
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:21,583
He's playing karate with Nandini.

1426
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,042
Drink it.

1427
01:45:29,375 --> 01:45:31,667
Stop it, stop hamming it up now.

1428
01:45:32,875 --> 01:45:36,708
And you finally learned
to shoot laser beams.

1429
01:45:37,542 --> 01:45:40,833
How else do you think
Jimmy's office burned down?

1430
01:45:42,500 --> 01:45:43,750
Supri, where are you going?

1431
01:45:44,333 --> 01:45:45,958
Grandpa asked us to sleep upstairs.

1432
01:45:46,542 --> 01:45:48,208
But there's a lot of room downstairs.

1433
01:45:48,333 --> 01:45:49,375
Come on.

1434
01:45:51,167 --> 01:45:52,125
Supri...

1435
01:45:53,917 --> 01:45:55,500
how did you meet Karate Man?

1436
01:45:56,042 --> 01:45:57,625
On the street.

1437
01:45:59,375 --> 01:46:02,667
- And that Atul?
- In a mall.

1438
01:46:03,292 --> 01:46:06,750
They were having a singing contest,
and he sang for me.

1439
01:46:09,750 --> 01:46:11,042
Fine judge me...

1440
01:46:12,708 --> 01:46:13,625
So what?

1441
01:46:14,208 --> 01:46:15,250
What did he sing?

1442
01:46:15,833 --> 01:46:18,542
<i>I try not to fall in love with you</i>

1443
01:46:19,292 --> 01:46:21,750
He didn't just sing a song,
he bulldozed us over.

1444
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:24,125
He came home, met my parents.

1445
01:46:24,500 --> 01:46:25,958
Gradually he paid for our expenses.

1446
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,750
He became the son,
and me, the daughter-in-law.

1447
01:46:30,458 --> 01:46:31,292
In my own home.

1448
01:46:33,583 --> 01:46:34,750
And anyway, mom is...

1449
01:46:37,292 --> 01:46:39,083
Forget it.

1450
01:46:43,250 --> 01:46:44,083
What now?

1451
01:46:45,292 --> 01:46:46,292
Now...

1452
01:46:47,083 --> 01:46:48,458
Now my life is...

1453
01:46:51,042 --> 01:46:52,750
So this is all my fault?

1454
01:46:54,042 --> 01:46:56,625
No sir, this isn't your fault.
This is my fault.

1455
01:46:57,042 --> 01:46:59,000
Like you said, I've superpowers.

1456
01:46:59,083 --> 01:47:00,667
Hundred times more than you.

1457
01:47:00,958 --> 01:47:03,417
You said "Supri jump",
and Supri jumped, and...

1458
01:47:04,292 --> 01:47:05,708
You're the same old Supri.

1459
01:47:09,333 --> 01:47:13,417
I swear Surya if we survive this time...

1460
01:47:14,875 --> 01:47:17,958
then your plan to catch
all the chain-snatchers.

1461
01:47:18,292 --> 01:47:19,542
I swear we'll do just that.

1462
01:47:20,333 --> 01:47:22,125
- Promise.
- Mother promise.

1463
01:47:28,458 --> 01:47:29,292
Come here.

1464
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:32,417
Shift.

1465
01:47:34,167 --> 01:47:36,375
So now the scene is...

1466
01:47:37,625 --> 01:47:39,125
life's all messed up like
it's been bitten by Itch mites.

1467
01:47:40,083 --> 01:47:43,708
I mean the itch feels strangely nice,
but it's also painful.

1468
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:46,833
But I don't feel itchy, ever.

1469
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,417
You have no idea what you're missing?

1470
01:47:51,542 --> 01:47:57,125
I mean when it happens, you feel restless.

1471
01:47:57,542 --> 01:48:01,667
And when you find the right spot,
it's like...

1472
01:48:02,125 --> 01:48:03,458
Just scratch me once.

1473
01:48:03,958 --> 01:48:05,375
- How?
- Like this.

1474
01:48:06,375 --> 01:48:07,833
Do it... Just a little.

1475
01:48:09,417 --> 01:48:10,417
Little to the left...

1476
01:48:10,875 --> 01:48:11,917
Left-left-left.

1477
01:48:12,167 --> 01:48:14,625
Down... A little further.

1478
01:48:18,083 --> 01:48:19,125
Stop.

1479
01:48:26,333 --> 01:48:27,750
What did you do those 12 years?

1480
01:48:29,542 --> 01:48:30,750
I used to wonder...

1481
01:48:33,458 --> 01:48:36,750
we had wings when we were kids.

1482
01:48:38,333 --> 01:48:40,583
So, why do we crawl when we grow up?

1483
01:48:41,458 --> 01:48:44,667
Please. Don't go all 'Rumi' on me now.

1484
01:48:45,042 --> 01:48:46,125
I am not in the mood.

1485
01:48:46,625 --> 01:48:47,583
Who is Rumi?

1486
01:48:49,833 --> 01:48:52,000
Thank God you don't know who Rumi is.

1487
01:48:52,292 --> 01:48:55,458
I mean, if people even sneeze today,
they are like...

1488
01:48:55,917 --> 01:48:58,708
- By Rumi.
- Who are they?

1489
01:48:58,917 --> 01:48:59,833
Everyone.

1490
01:49:02,167 --> 01:49:03,750
What does he say?

1491
01:49:06,625 --> 01:49:10,750
He said Surya...

1492
01:49:12,750 --> 01:49:16,083
from this moment you're
no longer just a man...

1493
01:49:16,458 --> 01:49:18,500
...you're going to be a legend.

1494
01:49:18,708 --> 01:49:19,667
What...

1495
01:49:20,833 --> 01:49:23,750
<i>In a very silent way</i>

1496
01:49:24,042 --> 01:49:27,500
<i>Through the games we lovers play</i>

1497
01:49:28,042 --> 01:49:31,333
<i>You have found a way to reach out</i>

1498
01:49:31,458 --> 01:49:34,083
<i>With your soul</i>

1499
01:49:35,333 --> 01:49:38,625
<i>Drown me in a shade of blue</i>

1500
01:49:38,792 --> 01:49:42,167
<i>For I can't imagine you</i>

1501
01:49:42,750 --> 01:49:44,167
I do get orgasms.

1502
01:49:47,250 --> 01:49:48,500
I mean I don't feel the pain...

1503
01:49:50,042 --> 01:49:51,167
I feel everything else.

1504
01:50:06,042 --> 01:50:07,333
S***

1505
01:50:08,917 --> 01:50:11,708
<i>Drown me in a shade of blue</i>

1506
01:50:12,583 --> 01:50:15,750
<i>For I can't imagine you
Floating in between the believe so...</i>

1507
01:50:15,875 --> 01:50:18,875
<i>Flying through the clouds</i>

1508
01:50:20,458 --> 01:50:26,792
<i>Dream time Fill the world with dream time</i>

1509
01:50:27,375 --> 01:50:31,167
<i>As we dance below the images</i>

1510
01:50:31,250 --> 01:50:35,042
<i>Of all we wish to do</i>

1511
01:50:35,625 --> 01:50:41,750
<i>Star light...
Fill the world with star light</i>

1512
01:50:42,333 --> 01:50:45,958
<i>As we float across the moonlit sea</i>

1513
01:50:46,208 --> 01:50:49,250
<i>On waves of dejavu</i>

1514
01:50:56,583 --> 01:50:58,292
I-pill and water.

1515
01:51:02,375 --> 01:51:03,375
Thank you.

1516
01:51:05,333 --> 01:51:11,250
<i>Dream time Fill the world with dream time</i>

1517
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:19,167
<i>In a very silent way</i>

1518
01:51:19,542 --> 01:51:22,667
<i>Through the games we lovers play</i>

1519
01:51:23,458 --> 01:51:27,083
<i>You have found a way to reach out</i>

1520
01:51:27,167 --> 01:51:29,917
<i>With your soul</i>

1521
01:51:42,250 --> 01:51:44,542
You're a real hero. You didn't run.

1522
01:51:45,167 --> 01:51:47,417
They tried to warn you,
but you didn't leave...

1523
01:51:47,583 --> 01:51:48,542
Impressive.

1524
01:51:49,542 --> 01:51:51,458
But now I've to repeat the rules and

1525
01:51:51,542 --> 01:51:53,292
regulations of the tournament
all over again.

1526
01:51:53,375 --> 01:51:54,667
Because you came in late.

1527
01:51:56,708 --> 01:52:00,125
So the tournament is 'All Against One'.

1528
01:52:00,583 --> 01:52:03,417
And the first contender is "Karate Mani".

1529
01:52:03,583 --> 01:52:05,042
Since you're my brother.

1530
01:52:05,458 --> 01:52:08,167
Go and fulfill your dream
of celebrating father's birthday.

1531
01:52:08,333 --> 01:52:11,125
I don't have 100 but
you'll have to settle with 20.

1532
01:52:13,750 --> 01:52:15,542
Who taped his leg?

1533
01:52:15,625 --> 01:52:17,583
Who taped that one leg?
Who is this genius?

1534
01:52:20,958 --> 01:52:22,833
If he falls, you'll go next. No. 2.

1535
01:52:23,333 --> 01:52:24,750
If she falls, you'll go after her. No. 3.

1536
01:52:24,833 --> 01:52:27,625
If you fall,
then our senior citizen. No. 4.

1537
01:52:27,917 --> 01:52:29,583
Uncle, you can fight, can you?

1538
01:52:30,125 --> 01:52:31,583
If my staff wins...

1539
01:52:32,333 --> 01:52:34,917
they won't get their jobs back,
but I will spare their lives.

1540
01:52:35,583 --> 01:52:36,417
That's the deal.

1541
01:52:36,917 --> 01:52:38,500
And I am the referee.

1542
01:52:38,708 --> 01:52:41,167
Referee's decision is final, okay.

1543
01:52:41,667 --> 01:52:42,917
Okay.

1544
01:52:44,375 --> 01:52:45,417
Okay, ready, start.

1545
01:52:47,750 --> 01:52:48,708
Quiet.

1546
01:52:48,792 --> 01:52:51,583
Why are you all screaming?
This is a residential area.

1547
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:53,042
We can be a bit subtle.

1548
01:52:53,333 --> 01:52:55,167
First untie his hands and legs.

1549
01:52:55,875 --> 01:52:56,958
And make him stand in the middle.

1550
01:52:57,042 --> 01:52:59,500
Make it look like a tournament.

1551
01:52:59,583 --> 01:53:00,792
Go.

1552
01:53:01,833 --> 01:53:03,917
<i>And thus started the
Vidya Bhavan Royal Rumble.</i>

1553
01:53:04,500 --> 01:53:08,333
<i>Like Jimmy said, Round 1 Karate Man.</i>

1554
01:53:08,917 --> 01:53:11,417
<i>And when the Karate Man
is knocked out, Round 2</i>

1555
01:53:11,667 --> 01:53:12,667
<i>Supri.</i>

1556
01:53:12,750 --> 01:53:14,542
<i>Because I was in Round 3.</i>

1557
01:53:14,958 --> 01:53:17,833
<i>So I was sitting on the bench for
a long time chewing on my kerchief.</i>

1558
01:53:23,500 --> 01:53:26,625
<i>I had this desire to get in the game
and break everyone's bones.</i>

1559
01:53:26,708 --> 01:53:28,000
<i>And then came a statutory warning.</i>

1560
01:53:28,500 --> 01:53:31,083
People always get caught farting
when everything else goes silent.

1561
01:53:31,708 --> 01:53:34,000
No matter how hard you try
to cover it with ambient noise.

1562
01:53:34,083 --> 01:53:36,333
At that precise moment the entire
universe becomes silent.

1563
01:53:36,708 --> 01:53:38,417
I don't know how, but it's like a law.

1564
01:53:39,667 --> 01:53:42,292
Don't try anything stupid, okay.

1565
01:53:42,792 --> 01:53:43,958
I'll catch you.

1566
01:53:49,417 --> 01:53:52,083
Don't step outside the tournament line.

1567
01:53:52,667 --> 01:53:55,417
If you do,
this senior citizen will be no more.

1568
01:53:55,500 --> 01:53:56,583
No more meaning...

1569
01:53:57,333 --> 01:53:58,333
What?

1570
01:53:59,167 --> 01:54:02,417
Be quiet, I cannot concentrate here.

1571
01:54:15,583 --> 01:54:16,708
<i>Out of nowhere...</i>

1572
01:54:17,167 --> 01:54:18,542
<i>steps in this guy.</i>

1573
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:20,792
<i>Do you know why? How would I know?</i>

1574
01:54:27,125 --> 01:54:28,625
<i>Jimmy got a little irritated.</i>

1575
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:33,917
<i>And after a couple of knocks...</i>

1576
01:54:36,708 --> 01:54:38,500
<i>he decided to run.</i>

1577
01:54:42,708 --> 01:54:45,542
<i>Jimmy told his shooter, kill him.</i>

1578
01:54:45,750 --> 01:54:47,083
<i>The Shooter told Jimmy...</i>

1579
01:54:47,292 --> 01:54:48,625
Boss, he's just a peon.

1580
01:54:48,708 --> 01:54:50,667
He's not security. Let him go.

1581
01:54:50,750 --> 01:54:52,208
<i>Jimmy's feelings were hurt.</i>

1582
01:54:52,792 --> 01:54:54,417
<i>So he stabbed the shooter too.</i>

1583
01:55:02,375 --> 01:55:06,000
<i>After all Jimmy was
a cliché psychotic villain.</i>

1584
01:56:20,500 --> 01:56:21,417
Hey Bill and Ted.

1585
01:56:52,667 --> 01:56:54,500
<i>If father hadn't found Nandini...</i>

1586
01:56:55,208 --> 01:56:56,875
<i>and if I hadn't stepped out of the house.</i>

1587
01:56:58,792 --> 01:57:00,708
<i>Then Supri might have been in Canada.</i>

1588
01:57:01,417 --> 01:57:02,542
<i>And Karate Man...</i>

1589
01:57:02,833 --> 01:57:04,875
<i>might be drinking with Pablo.</i>

1590
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,500
But behind every mind blowing story...

1591
01:57:13,708 --> 01:57:16,000
<i>there are some pretty bad decisions.</i>

1592
01:57:17,333 --> 01:57:19,292
<i>Grandpa said that someday.</i>

1593
01:57:19,875 --> 01:57:20,792
Skinny Boy.

1594
01:57:21,042 --> 01:57:24,667
Boss, he doesn't feel any pain.

1595
01:57:25,542 --> 01:57:27,125
Do we have to go one by one?

1596
01:57:27,458 --> 01:57:28,917
Why don't we just all kill him together?

1597
01:57:55,750 --> 01:57:58,417
<i>Oh, it ended so soon.</i>

1598
01:57:58,875 --> 01:58:01,000
<i>I thought I was fighting forever.</i>

1599
01:58:08,167 --> 01:58:13,583
<i>If I had died at 27, then I could've
attained legitimate legend status.</i>

1600
01:58:17,833 --> 01:58:22,000
<i>Then on, grandpa kept begging for
some water like a thespian.</i>

1601
01:58:22,708 --> 01:58:24,750
<i>Jimmy and his men just watched.</i>

1602
01:58:35,125 --> 01:58:39,292
<i>Then I died and Jimmy killed Grandpa.</i>

1603
01:58:40,333 --> 01:58:41,917
<i>It could have happened...</i>

1604
01:58:42,292 --> 01:58:44,250
<i>but my mother didn't let it happen.</i>

1605
02:00:19,750 --> 02:00:21,792
Go finish them.

1606
02:00:23,167 --> 02:00:24,875
Go kill them.

1607
02:00:30,750 --> 02:00:32,417
Fair fighting, huh.

1608
02:00:34,750 --> 02:00:37,583
Mr. Samurai, best of luck.

1609
02:01:07,917 --> 02:01:10,958
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.

1610
02:01:11,042 --> 02:01:13,250
Stop. Just a minute.
I am the referee, just listen to me.

1611
02:01:13,333 --> 02:01:14,750
This tournament is no fun.

1612
02:01:14,958 --> 02:01:15,792
Right?

1613
02:01:15,875 --> 02:01:17,750
Let's make the rules
and regulations clearer.

1614
02:01:18,458 --> 02:01:20,708
Ten points, if you score first.

1615
02:01:21,292 --> 02:01:22,625
Then you can leave with these three.

1616
02:01:22,708 --> 02:01:26,083
And Samurai, if you don't justify
your salary now.

1617
02:01:26,750 --> 02:01:30,167
Go commit Hara-kiri. Okay.

1618
02:01:30,375 --> 02:01:32,625
Absolutely simple. No complication.

1619
02:01:32,875 --> 02:01:34,708
No points for blocking,
Points only for a hit.

1620
02:01:35,208 --> 02:01:37,917
Wait. Wait man.

1621
02:01:38,833 --> 02:01:40,958
Very simple, like Hollywood.

1622
02:01:41,333 --> 02:01:43,625
Okay, ready?

1623
02:01:44,833 --> 02:01:45,750
Ready?

1624
02:01:47,625 --> 02:01:48,583
Start.

1625
02:01:49,833 --> 02:01:51,708
One point, Samurai.

1626
02:01:54,542 --> 02:01:56,500
Maroon suit 0, Samurai 2.

1627
02:01:58,250 --> 02:02:00,000
Good shot, Samurai 3.

1628
02:02:03,500 --> 02:02:05,958
Four!

1629
02:02:07,500 --> 02:02:09,000
Five!

1630
02:02:36,792 --> 02:02:39,167
Maroon suit 0, Samurai 6.

1631
02:02:49,333 --> 02:02:51,708
No need to get up. Just watch lying down.

1632
02:02:53,208 --> 02:02:54,167
Enjoy.

1633
02:02:57,625 --> 02:02:59,125
Did you hit him very hard on the Liver?

1634
02:03:00,500 --> 02:03:01,917
Cheap Liquor Connoisseur.

1635
02:03:03,667 --> 02:03:04,750
He's gone!

1636
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:08,458
Lie down. Lie down. Rest.

1637
02:03:08,958 --> 02:03:11,417
<i>If grandpa had sung some motivational
song when I was a kid...</i>

1638
02:03:12,417 --> 02:03:13,417
<i>then I could've hummed it now.</i>

1639
02:03:14,625 --> 02:03:15,667
<i>But he was out of tune.</i>

1640
02:03:16,583 --> 02:03:17,500
<i>Doesn't matter.</i>

1641
02:03:18,667 --> 02:03:19,792
<i>Come on, Surya. Come on.</i>

1642
02:03:20,875 --> 02:03:22,000
<i>Come on, Surya. Come on.</i>

1643
02:03:22,875 --> 02:03:24,708
<i>- I'll have to do with this.</i>
- Ready? Ready?

1644
02:03:27,667 --> 02:03:28,792
Fight.

1645
02:03:30,333 --> 02:03:32,750
<i>Surya! Surya!</i>

1646
02:03:33,708 --> 02:03:35,792
<i>Surya! Surya!</i>

1647
02:03:36,708 --> 02:03:38,667
<i>Surya! Surya!</i>

1648
02:03:39,625 --> 02:03:40,708
<i>Surya!</i>

1649
02:03:50,167 --> 02:03:51,500
Okay, okay.

1650
02:04:03,375 --> 02:04:05,875
Okay, okay. Maroon suit 5, Samurai 7.

1651
02:04:23,333 --> 02:04:24,333
Is it broken?

1652
02:04:24,417 --> 02:04:27,292
Mind-blowing.
You did the right thing, but.

1653
02:04:27,375 --> 02:04:28,375
I counted it.

1654
02:04:28,625 --> 02:04:30,458
7 blocks. So you get 0 points.

1655
02:04:30,542 --> 02:04:32,292
He broke your leg, so he gets one point.

1656
02:04:32,500 --> 02:04:34,125
Maroon suit 5, Samurai 8.

1657
02:04:34,708 --> 02:04:36,208
Fair fighting. Everything fair.

1658
02:04:38,250 --> 02:04:40,792
The Samurai really gave you
a good beating.

1659
02:04:42,417 --> 02:04:44,042
He's out. Out...
Two points, take it.

1660
02:04:44,833 --> 02:04:46,250
Hurry up, I am getting bored.

1661
02:04:46,333 --> 02:04:47,333
Finish this quickly.

1662
02:04:48,625 --> 02:04:49,625
Finish. Finish.

1663
02:05:01,333 --> 02:05:02,833
<i>Easy Surya easy.</i>

1664
02:05:06,583 --> 02:05:09,375
<i>Don't put pressure on the foot, just limp.</i>

1665
02:05:10,208 --> 02:05:13,000
<i>Remember, no pressure on the leg</i>

1666
02:05:13,083 --> 02:05:14,917
<i>or the bones will never join.</i>

1667
02:05:15,625 --> 02:05:17,083
Come on, only two more points to go.

1668
02:05:17,167 --> 02:05:18,833
<i>Watching Bruce Lee taught me...</i>

1669
02:05:19,458 --> 02:05:21,500
<i>Mid fight, when the opponent's
kicking your ass...</i>

1670
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:23,792
<i>Take your shirt off.</i>

1671
02:05:24,167 --> 02:05:25,125
<i>Its good distraction!</i>

1672
02:05:29,958 --> 02:05:32,375
<i>And, one should keep drinking water.</i>

1673
02:05:51,917 --> 02:05:55,042
Come on, fulfill your master's dream.

1674
02:05:55,667 --> 02:05:57,333
Come on, come on.

1675
02:05:58,000 --> 02:05:59,458
Sentimental boy.

1676
02:06:05,333 --> 02:06:07,875
<i>Un, dos, tres, Kaboom!</i>

1677
02:06:08,708 --> 02:06:10,500
<i>I shall avenge grandpa, Supri...</i>

1678
02:06:10,708 --> 02:06:13,042
<i>Karate Man's pride...
I take a solemn oath...</i>

1679
02:06:13,125 --> 02:06:15,917
Hey, wait I have not
finished monologue. Hey!

1680
02:06:17,125 --> 02:06:18,292
Point. Point.

1681
02:06:18,417 --> 02:06:19,833
Nine - Five!

1682
02:06:24,125 --> 02:06:26,417
<i>Sorry Samurai, but this
is about me saving my childhood.</i>

1683
02:06:26,917 --> 02:06:28,708
<i>I'll have to break some rules.</i>

1684
02:06:29,625 --> 02:06:31,083
<i>It's time to be awesome.</i>

1685
02:07:01,583 --> 02:07:02,500
Chain.

1686
02:07:03,125 --> 02:07:04,000
You...

1687
02:07:04,458 --> 02:07:05,583
Are you crazy?

1688
02:07:05,833 --> 02:07:07,583
Get lost. Don't irritate me.

1689
02:07:08,167 --> 02:07:09,667
Hey...

1690
02:07:10,292 --> 02:07:12,042
Hey you...
Why are you so stubborn?

1691
02:07:12,167 --> 02:07:13,000
Why are you so stressed about the chain?

1692
02:07:13,083 --> 02:07:14,833
Is that Mani your God?

1693
02:07:16,250 --> 02:07:17,583
Hey you...

1694
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:19,333
Hey...

1695
02:07:20,042 --> 02:07:21,417
I will shoot you... Shoot...

1696
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,458
- Surya.
- Get up. Get up and hit him.

1697
02:07:24,583 --> 02:07:25,958
I will shoot.

1698
02:07:26,083 --> 02:07:27,417
Move, move.

1699
02:07:27,500 --> 02:07:28,375
I will shoot.

1700
02:07:28,458 --> 02:07:30,458
This is a residential area.
Don't force me to shoot you.

1701
02:07:30,542 --> 02:07:31,792
I will shoot... Shoot.

1702
02:07:36,083 --> 02:07:37,208
Surya.

1703
02:07:59,917 --> 02:08:00,917
Ouch!

1704
02:09:23,500 --> 02:09:26,875
<i>No one will be seen saluting
the National Flag.</i>

1705
02:09:28,542 --> 02:09:31,208
<i>Nor will anyone hear
the national anthem being played.</i>

1706
02:09:32,792 --> 02:09:36,458
<i>Nor will anyone shed tears of joy
to celebrate my fight.</i>

1707
02:09:38,292 --> 02:09:40,792
<i>For that you'll have to shift
to the next screen.</i>

1708
02:09:41,708 --> 02:09:43,083
<i>To hell with those endings</i>

1709
02:09:44,125 --> 02:09:45,750
<i>I feel like Rocky Balboa.</i>

1710
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:50,125
<i>Life recap.</i>

1711
02:09:51,083 --> 02:09:53,167
<i>This time I am definitely going to die.</i>

1712
02:09:54,458 --> 02:09:56,125
Grandpa.

1713
02:09:58,208 --> 02:09:59,875
Hey Surya... You're up.

1714
02:10:01,042 --> 02:10:03,083
Even I am alive, I am alive too.

1715
02:10:03,167 --> 02:10:04,083
Don't worry.

1716
02:10:06,042 --> 02:10:08,458
Don't move, Grandpa. Lie down and shut up.

1717
02:10:08,792 --> 02:10:10,833
You guys have grown up
to become criminals.

1718
02:10:10,917 --> 02:10:12,208
Bullets. Fractures.

1719
02:10:12,292 --> 02:10:14,583
From next time don't
expect me to treat you

1720
02:10:14,667 --> 02:10:16,042
nor expect to survive?

1721
02:10:16,125 --> 02:10:17,500
Supri, stay away from this family.

1722
02:10:17,583 --> 02:10:18,875
You guys will send me to jail as well.

1723
02:10:18,958 --> 02:10:20,000
Yeah, okay, okay.

1724
02:10:20,083 --> 02:10:20,958
Stupid door.

1725
02:10:22,083 --> 02:10:23,500
Bring my bottle of whiskey.

1726
02:10:25,958 --> 02:10:26,833
Karate Man...

1727
02:10:26,917 --> 02:10:28,625
Sit down, relax.

1728
02:10:34,667 --> 02:10:36,042
- Grandpa.
- Yes.

1729
02:10:37,417 --> 02:10:38,792
We vanquished evil.

1730
02:10:38,875 --> 02:10:42,958
Don't tell you father that
he'll fall very ill.

1731
02:10:43,042 --> 02:10:44,792
Are you out of your mind?

1732
02:10:45,083 --> 02:10:46,542
Do you even know what happened?

1733
02:10:46,625 --> 02:10:48,542
Vanquished evil nonsense!

1734
02:10:53,083 --> 02:10:54,667
Supri, from now on...

1735
02:10:55,083 --> 02:10:56,500
don't use a gun.

1736
02:10:57,083 --> 02:10:58,292
Only use your hands.

1737
02:11:05,667 --> 02:11:07,833
<i>Karate Man took the entire
blame on himself.</i>

1738
02:11:08,833 --> 02:11:10,125
<i>And became a legend.</i>

1739
02:11:12,292 --> 02:11:14,000
<i>When father returned from his honeymoon...</i>

1740
02:11:16,375 --> 02:11:18,292
<i>his blood pressure dropped.</i>

1741
02:11:18,750 --> 02:11:20,125
<i>But it's all under control now.</i>

1742
02:11:22,292 --> 02:11:24,667
<i>Supri's mother's master plan worked too.</i>

1743
02:11:24,958 --> 02:11:26,958
<i>There was only one pill in it</i>

1744
02:11:29,125 --> 02:11:31,917
<i>And I fulfilled my destiny
according to my father.</i>

1745
02:11:32,708 --> 02:11:34,542
<i>I became an accountant.</i>

1746
02:11:35,292 --> 02:11:38,083
<i>You're not Mr. India</i>

1747
02:11:38,375 --> 02:11:39,667
<i>Even Supri mended her way.</i>

1748
02:11:40,625 --> 02:11:42,000
<i>Like the rest of the crowd.</i>

1749
02:11:42,083 --> 02:11:43,542
<i>She went looking for a job.</i>

1750
02:11:43,625 --> 02:11:45,500
<i>Hop on my spaceship</i>

1751
02:11:45,667 --> 02:11:47,583
<i>Let's fly away...</i>

1752
02:11:47,667 --> 02:11:49,167
<i>Back to the future</i>

1753
02:11:49,292 --> 02:11:50,583
<i>And this...</i>

1754
02:11:50,667 --> 02:11:51,792
<i>What is this?</i>

1755
02:11:52,750 --> 02:11:54,792
<i>This is a story for some other time.</i>

1756
02:11:54,917 --> 02:11:55,917
<i>Rappan Rapi Rap</i>

1757
02:11:56,042 --> 02:11:57,917
<i>In dark alleys, In the dead of night</i>

1758
02:11:58,000 --> 02:11:59,917
<i>Rappan Rapi Rap</i>

1759
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,083
<i>You be ready with your laser</i>

1760
02:12:02,167 --> 02:12:03,917
<i>Rappan Rapi Rap</i>

1761
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,125
<i>With dragons stashed away</i>

1762
02:12:06,208 --> 02:12:08,083
<i>Rappan Rapi Rap</i>

1763
02:12:08,167 --> 02:12:10,792
<i>This is a bond forged in love</i>

1764
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:28,958
<i>I'll raze evil to the ground</i>

1765
02:12:29,125 --> 02:12:31,042
<i>Feed 30 till it turns 60</i>

1766
02:12:31,208 --> 02:12:33,125
<i>Well, 30 can never turn to 60</i>

1767
02:12:33,208 --> 02:12:35,250
<i>It goes 30... 40... 50... 60</i>

1768
02:12:37,417 --> 02:12:39,417
<i>Big trouble, little China, Karate chop</i>

1769
