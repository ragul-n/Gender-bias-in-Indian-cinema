1
00:00:38,448 --> 00:00:42,646
Dharma...
Your wife has just delivered.

2
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,785
What?
- A bonny baby boy.

3
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:47,650
Just hold this.

4
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,356
The little master has arrived.

5
00:01:08,078 --> 00:01:09,409
Myy respects...
what did l say?

6
00:01:09,646 --> 00:01:11,045
Always be victorious.

7
00:01:11,748 --> 00:01:18,950
God will bless your wife and
the child with a long life.

8
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:27,052
You should thank your wife for
gifting you with a baby-boy.

9
00:01:27,297 --> 00:01:29,026
Sure. l'll thank her right now.

10
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,428
Where're you going, brother?
- To the room.

11
00:01:34,071 --> 00:01:37,529
What for?
- l forgot my overcoat.

12
00:01:37,774 --> 00:01:39,833
lt's lying outside.

13
00:01:40,644 --> 00:01:42,271
l've to take some cattle feed.

14
00:01:42,813 --> 00:01:45,839
The cattle feed is kept inside
or outside the room?

15
00:01:46,817 --> 00:01:50,309
Why don't you say that you
want to see my nephew.

16
00:01:50,687 --> 00:01:52,450
lf you know that, then why
don't you let me in?

17
00:01:52,722 --> 00:01:57,887
l will. But you'll have to
give me a silver coin.

18
00:02:03,467 --> 00:02:05,992
Take this.
- But this is only 50 paise.

19
00:02:06,336 --> 00:02:08,099
Right now, l've only this much.

20
00:02:08,338 --> 00:02:12,672
l'll present you an ear-ring
and 1 1 rupees. How much?

21
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:14,237
Eleven rupees.
- Yes.

22
00:02:14,611 --> 00:02:18,377
Greetings lady.
- Only greetings will not do.

23
00:02:19,216 --> 00:02:23,312
l want 5 coconuts, half a kilo
jaggery and eleven rupees.

24
00:02:23,787 --> 00:02:25,311
Then only will
l allow you inside.

25
00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:26,956
l've arranged for everything.

26
00:02:27,657 --> 00:02:31,252
20 coconuts, jaggery and
21 rupees. How much?

27
00:02:31,328 --> 00:02:32,761
Twenty one rupees.
- Yes.

28
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,696
Go and take from the uncle
sitting outside on the cot.

29
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:54,880
What are you doing?

30
00:02:55,152 --> 00:03:00,283
Uncle told me that a boy has been born
in this family after a long time...

31
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,118
and he also asked me to thank you
for this. So l'm thanking you.

32
00:03:04,127 --> 00:03:05,526
Show me his face.

33
00:03:10,567 --> 00:03:16,528
He's as good-looking as his father.

34
00:03:18,275 --> 00:03:20,743
Salutations, little master.
How are you?

35
00:03:21,111 --> 00:03:24,842
Didn't you recognize me?
l'm your father.

36
00:03:26,449 --> 00:03:27,711
Why is he not answering?

37
00:03:28,418 --> 00:03:31,319
Stupid. How can he speak?

38
00:03:31,688 --> 00:03:33,713
Why not? But will he speak in
three or four days?

39
00:03:34,124 --> 00:03:38,117
No. lt'll take six months.
...How many months?

40
00:03:38,528 --> 00:03:39,358
Six.

41
00:03:39,596 --> 00:03:42,156
No, in six months, l'll make
him plough the fields.

42
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:45,500
Did you plough the
fields in six months?

43
00:03:47,437 --> 00:03:50,338
Forget ploughing.
l started romancing with you.

44
00:03:53,243 --> 00:03:56,576
Don't lie.
Didn't l fall for you?

45
00:04:00,817 --> 00:04:01,476
Who's there?

46
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:04,619
Brother, come out.
The midwife is looking for you.

47
00:04:04,854 --> 00:04:05,843
Yes. l'm coming.

48
00:04:06,623 --> 00:04:10,389
Didn't you give anything to her?
- No.

49
00:04:11,361 --> 00:04:13,295
l had fifty paise which
l gave Laxmi.

50
00:04:14,097 --> 00:04:16,827
Don't you worry. l'll arrange
for everything right now.

51
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:22,397
l'm worried for you.
We're not two but one.

52
00:04:22,772 --> 00:04:24,706
Being the eldest, all the
responsibility is on your shoulders.

53
00:04:25,108 --> 00:04:28,134
l also know that you're worried
about Laxmi's marriage.

54
00:04:29,246 --> 00:04:31,305
There's no guarantee
of the crops.

55
00:04:31,815 --> 00:04:34,045
And now, we have a new-born.

56
00:04:34,584 --> 00:04:37,712
From where will you get one or two
hundred rupees for the functions?

57
00:04:38,255 --> 00:04:41,884
Why are you worried?
You shouldn't worry.

58
00:04:42,592 --> 00:04:47,029
One should be sincere and hardworking.
Everything will be all right.

59
00:04:47,964 --> 00:04:51,832
l'll fulfill all the responsibilities
of my little master.

60
00:04:52,402 --> 00:04:58,671
l just want you to be lost in my love.
l'll take care of everything else.

61
00:04:59,309 --> 00:05:00,742
What did l say?
- Care.

62
00:05:01,478 --> 00:05:04,072
l'll arrange for some money
and will be back soon.

63
00:05:05,248 --> 00:05:06,442
Don't you worry.

64
00:05:19,062 --> 00:05:20,552
Hariya, give me two hundred rupees.

65
00:05:21,131 --> 00:05:22,496
Two hundred rupees? What for?

66
00:05:22,932 --> 00:05:27,699
Don't you know what has happened?
- What?

67
00:05:28,004 --> 00:05:30,837
l've been blessed with a baby boy.
- A boy?

68
00:05:31,941 --> 00:05:35,707
l need money for
the celebrations.

69
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:41,442
l'll pay you back as soon
as l harvest the crops.

70
00:05:42,052 --> 00:05:45,886
Don't say no.
Or else...

71
00:05:46,122 --> 00:05:47,487
l'll be humiliated in
front of the villagers.

72
00:05:47,691 --> 00:05:50,057
And you know l would leave
the village if l'm humiliated.

73
00:05:51,261 --> 00:05:56,062
l'll pay you. But if you wish, you
can earn this money in two days.

74
00:05:56,933 --> 00:05:58,491
ln two days! How?

75
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:01,594
Some people have come from the
city on a hunting expedition.

76
00:06:02,472 --> 00:06:06,772
You know the jungle very well.
And nobody else dares go there.

77
00:06:07,777 --> 00:06:12,339
Go with them and make some money.
You will be saved from this debt.

78
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,015
You are right. Where are they?
Take me there.

79
00:06:20,423 --> 00:06:21,447
Come along.

80
00:06:26,129 --> 00:06:30,828
So Heer and Veer said
they wanted to kill a tiger.

81
00:06:31,067 --> 00:06:32,728
And l thought,
why not me too?

82
00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:35,729
They killed a tiger and...

83
00:06:35,972 --> 00:06:37,530
l did more!

84
00:06:38,274 --> 00:06:41,004
Where are they...?

85
00:06:41,411 --> 00:06:43,641
Come along.
Don't be scared.

86
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,812
Who's scared?

87
00:07:28,525 --> 00:07:30,789
Look, l've killed the tiger.

88
00:07:39,702 --> 00:07:42,671
Dharma take this.
- What letter is this, sir?

89
00:07:42,972 --> 00:07:44,530
lt's not a letter.

90
00:07:44,874 --> 00:07:47,399
lt contains 300 rupees, which
is your hard earned money.

91
00:07:48,111 --> 00:07:50,944
And another 500 rupees
for saving my life.

92
00:07:51,815 --> 00:07:56,377
300 rupees is fine.
l've worked hard for it.

93
00:07:57,153 --> 00:07:59,883
Why're you paying me for saving
your life? lt was my duty.

94
00:08:00,256 --> 00:08:01,655
You'll have to take it,
for my sake.

95
00:08:03,526 --> 00:08:05,357
lf you insist,
l'll keep it.

96
00:08:05,762 --> 00:08:07,627
Dharma, why don't you
come to the city?

97
00:08:08,064 --> 00:08:10,191
What will l do there?

98
00:08:10,934 --> 00:08:14,768
l was born here and
will die here one day.

99
00:08:15,104 --> 00:08:16,662
What will l do there?
Tell me.

100
00:08:17,073 --> 00:08:20,406
We need an honest and
courageous man like you.

101
00:08:21,244 --> 00:08:23,804
l'd suggest that you come to the
city and start working for us.

102
00:08:24,414 --> 00:08:26,848
What can this illiterate
do in the city?

103
00:08:28,952 --> 00:08:31,614
What do you take me for?
Well?

104
00:08:35,024 --> 00:08:37,788
''Do not take me for an idiot...''

105
00:08:38,094 --> 00:08:39,561
''l'm a very useful man''

106
00:08:39,896 --> 00:08:42,023
''Do not take me for an idiot...''

107
00:08:42,332 --> 00:08:43,924
''l'm a very useful man''

108
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,931
''l can very well make out...''

109
00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:56,878
''who's a good man and
who's evil''

110
00:08:57,247 --> 00:08:59,306
''Do not take me for an idiot...''

111
00:08:59,482 --> 00:09:01,416
''l'm a very useful man, sir''

112
00:09:01,551 --> 00:09:04,247
''A very useful man''

113
00:09:14,531 --> 00:09:18,490
''l once went into the forests...''

114
00:09:21,738 --> 00:09:24,298
''and ran into the bandits''

115
00:09:26,943 --> 00:09:29,241
''One held a rifle...''

116
00:09:29,445 --> 00:09:31,709
''another held a knife''

117
00:09:34,484 --> 00:09:36,076
''And l asked...''

118
00:09:36,719 --> 00:09:39,552
''how many are you?''

119
00:09:39,756 --> 00:09:41,189
''They said, '10' ''

120
00:09:41,391 --> 00:09:43,188
And l said,
''ls that all?''

121
00:09:45,662 --> 00:09:49,598
''l worked on them and
they were soon buried''

122
00:09:51,568 --> 00:09:53,866
''Do not take me to be
just another guy...''

123
00:09:54,037 --> 00:09:55,834
''l'm a very useful man''

124
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:03,274
''A very useful man''

125
00:10:13,489 --> 00:10:18,119
''Once, in my village...''

126
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:25,397
''there came this lady
from the city''

127
00:10:25,768 --> 00:10:30,330
''She was happy to see
a youth like me''

128
00:10:30,807 --> 00:10:32,934
''She was happy indeed''

129
00:10:33,543 --> 00:10:36,671
''Lovingly then...''

130
00:10:36,913 --> 00:10:40,110
''she gave me a rose''

131
00:10:41,484 --> 00:10:43,384
''l said, you're giving
me a rose?''

132
00:10:43,753 --> 00:10:46,381
''She apologized to me and
said she had made a mistake''

133
00:10:51,194 --> 00:10:53,594
''Do not think l'm a fool...''

134
00:10:53,796 --> 00:10:56,162
''l'm a very useful man''

135
00:11:00,837 --> 00:11:03,328
''A very useful man''

136
00:11:04,173 --> 00:11:12,740
''l can very well say who's
a good man and who's evil''

137
00:11:13,216 --> 00:11:15,241
''Do not take me to be
just another guy...''

138
00:11:15,451 --> 00:11:17,681
''l'm a very useful man...''

139
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:23,383
''A very useful man indeed''

140
00:12:21,284 --> 00:12:23,479
Have you eaten?

141
00:12:25,321 --> 00:12:28,518
Here... eat this.
Go on.

142
00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:43,102
Dharma, where have you
been since this morning?

143
00:12:43,973 --> 00:12:48,740
What can l say? l'm upset.
- Why?

144
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:55,674
l went to the market place and
sold all the crops for 300 rupees.

145
00:12:56,452 --> 00:12:59,785
Only 300 rupees?!
- Yes.

146
00:13:01,357 --> 00:13:05,293
Myy land is not fertile.

147
00:13:05,928 --> 00:13:09,295
l can only run the kitchen out of
the crop it produces.

148
00:13:10,133 --> 00:13:11,964
Now tell me what l am to do?

149
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:15,034
l've the responsibility of the
marriage of my sister, Laxmi.

150
00:13:15,538 --> 00:13:19,941
Myy parents are no more.
How long can l take this burden?

151
00:13:21,511 --> 00:13:25,413
Why don't you go to the city
and work for those people?

152
00:13:26,182 --> 00:13:29,379
They had asked you to go to them
whenever you needed a job.

153
00:13:29,786 --> 00:13:32,414
You might get a job there.

154
00:13:34,924 --> 00:13:37,358
Yes, l've received
a letter from them.

155
00:13:38,795 --> 00:13:43,926
l have an uncle in the city.
l can stay at his place.

156
00:13:46,102 --> 00:13:49,868
l'll try that out. See you.

157
00:14:01,984 --> 00:14:04,976
Anybody in? Uncle...?

158
00:14:05,755 --> 00:14:07,780
Greetings Uncle!
- Dharma, is that you?

159
00:14:08,758 --> 00:14:11,318
This is Radha, Laxmi and
my little master.

160
00:14:16,165 --> 00:14:18,156
Greetings aunt.
- Look who is here.

161
00:14:18,634 --> 00:14:20,192
Didn't you recognize me?
l'm Dharma.

162
00:14:21,003 --> 00:14:24,063
Dharma?
- l seek your blessings aunt.

163
00:14:24,674 --> 00:14:28,235
God bless you all. How did
you all come suddenly?

164
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:31,243
Let them rest and have
something to drink.

165
00:14:31,547 --> 00:14:33,105
l'll get some right now.

166
00:14:34,784 --> 00:14:36,979
What was l saying...?
What brings you here?

167
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:41,522
There were these rich men who came
to our village. Who was it?

168
00:14:41,724 --> 00:14:42,554
The rich men.

169
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:44,953
And they've given me
a job in the city.

170
00:14:45,728 --> 00:14:49,858
Good! What's left in
village anyway?

171
00:14:51,334 --> 00:14:53,461
Since you're already here
in the city...

172
00:14:53,669 --> 00:14:54,966
we thought we could stay here
till we found alternate...

173
00:14:55,204 --> 00:14:58,799
Of course, you can stay here.
lt's such a big house.

174
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,206
Big house, my foot!

175
00:15:02,178 --> 00:15:03,873
l've been complaining that it's
so small and you must make...

176
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,775
two more rooms for the guests.

177
00:15:06,315 --> 00:15:08,943
You always say that but..
- But what?

178
00:15:09,285 --> 00:15:12,948
We've five rooms. One for him, one
for our son, one for the puppy...

179
00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:18,252
Puppy? Who is Puppy?

180
00:15:22,131 --> 00:15:24,793
They have a room for their dog.

181
00:15:26,402 --> 00:15:27,960
We'll accommodate them
in the guest room.

182
00:15:28,137 --> 00:15:30,799
We'll manage there.
- Yes, aunt.

183
00:15:33,876 --> 00:15:36,504
That room has a carpet
worth 5000 rupees.

184
00:15:37,113 --> 00:15:39,013
Who will pay for it,
if you damage it?

185
00:15:42,251 --> 00:15:47,086
This is a city. We even recruit
servants who are educated.

186
00:15:47,423 --> 00:15:48,981
And you're not literate.

187
00:15:51,227 --> 00:15:54,788
Do you want to hear anything more?
Let's leave.

188
00:15:57,233 --> 00:15:58,723
See you, aunt.

189
00:16:00,069 --> 00:16:03,402
Do come sometime.
This is your own house.

190
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,741
Tea! Hot, steaming tea!

191
00:16:11,347 --> 00:16:14,942
Come here.
- Do you want some tea?

192
00:16:16,252 --> 00:16:18,220
Sit here.
- Do you want tea sir?

193
00:16:18,688 --> 00:16:23,182
Yes. Give me a cup of tea.
- Full or half.

194
00:16:23,693 --> 00:16:26,821
What's that?
- Do you want full or half?

195
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:30,093
What's full or half?
- Tea, sir.

196
00:16:30,566 --> 00:16:32,363
Give me some tea.
l don't follow you.

197
00:16:32,735 --> 00:16:35,363
You seem to be new in Bombay.

198
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:41,902
We've just come from Bhind Myorena.
Myy forefathers are from Allahabad.

199
00:16:42,511 --> 00:16:44,069
l own land in Bhind Myorena.

200
00:16:45,348 --> 00:16:47,407
Are you a native of
Bandit Myansingh's village?

201
00:16:48,184 --> 00:16:51,483
Do you think all those people coming
from that village are bandits?

202
00:16:51,821 --> 00:16:53,652
No. l was just asking.

203
00:16:54,156 --> 00:16:58,252
There are dangerous bandits in
Bombay, compared to your village.

204
00:16:58,694 --> 00:17:01,219
The bandits from the villages are
caught when they come out in the open.

205
00:17:01,864 --> 00:17:05,664
But here, you neither see them
nor are they ever caught.

206
00:17:06,202 --> 00:17:08,466
Tell me something, mister...
- Yes?

207
00:17:12,441 --> 00:17:16,502
Where is this street? What is
it called... Myohammed Ali Road?

208
00:17:17,413 --> 00:17:21,440
Do you want a bus?
Take the straight route from here.

209
00:17:22,551 --> 00:17:23,950
Whom do you want to see?

210
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:29,485
Excuse me, sir...
Do the three gentlemen work here?

211
00:17:29,692 --> 00:17:30,852
Three gentlemen?

212
00:17:31,861 --> 00:17:34,227
What are their names l forgot?
Myr. Ajit, Myr. Sujit...

213
00:17:36,632 --> 00:17:38,793
Sureshbabu! l've found him!

214
00:17:40,202 --> 00:17:42,500
How are you, sir?
- l'm fine.

215
00:17:43,139 --> 00:17:48,372
This is my wife, sister and my son.
Say hello to him.

216
00:17:49,645 --> 00:17:52,136
lt's good that you've come.
Myr. Ajit has been remembering you.

217
00:17:52,481 --> 00:17:55,314
Where is Myr. Ajit?
- He's in his cabin.

218
00:17:55,718 --> 00:17:56,810
You may sit here.

219
00:17:57,453 --> 00:18:00,251
You sit here and take
care of the luggage.

220
00:18:06,262 --> 00:18:09,663
See that? They are better
than our relatives.

221
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,628
Greetings Myr. Ajit.
Greetings Myr. Sujit!

222
00:18:15,738 --> 00:18:18,605
Didn't you recognize him?
He's the same man who saved my life.

223
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,868
Dharma, when did you arrive?
- Yesterday.

224
00:18:22,745 --> 00:18:25,077
l was so very harassed...
l'm glad l've met you.

225
00:18:25,481 --> 00:18:26,880
Why? What happened?

226
00:18:27,116 --> 00:18:29,311
What do l tell you. People are
so rude in this city.

227
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:35,318
Not all. Look at us.
We wanted you, so we called you.

228
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:40,561
You're angels for me.
You called me, and l came over.

229
00:18:41,263 --> 00:18:44,721
Please arrange for our stay.
We've been sleeping on the streets.

230
00:18:45,134 --> 00:18:47,329
Myy wife and sister are sitting
outside. Should l call them in?

231
00:18:47,703 --> 00:18:49,227
No. That's not necessary.

232
00:18:49,772 --> 00:18:51,763
Myangat...
- Yes, sir?

233
00:18:52,241 --> 00:18:54,709
Has the room where Ramu used
to stay, been vacated?

234
00:18:54,944 --> 00:18:57,071
Yes.
- Give that room to Dharma.

235
00:18:59,148 --> 00:19:00,706
And here's what you
will do, Dharma.

236
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:03,951
Just take rest today and
come to work from tomorrow.

237
00:19:04,386 --> 00:19:07,651
As my mother used to say, sir...
As who used to say...?

238
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:08,979
Your mother.

239
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:13,827
She used to say, what you must
do tomorrow, do today.

240
00:19:14,096 --> 00:19:15,085
And what you will do today,...

241
00:19:15,297 --> 00:19:16,321
l understand!

242
00:19:16,565 --> 00:19:18,795
Suresh, take Dharma
to the stores.

243
00:19:19,668 --> 00:19:21,192
Very well, sir.
l'm leaving.

244
00:19:21,937 --> 00:19:23,029
Good-bye, sir.

245
00:19:26,809 --> 00:19:29,869
Why employ a village bumpkin
in the concern...?

246
00:19:30,112 --> 00:19:33,275
D'you know why l called him over?
- Why?

247
00:19:33,649 --> 00:19:35,776
We can trust him with millions.

248
00:19:40,689 --> 00:19:44,147
He will even lay down his life,
but he will never betray us.

249
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:06,244
Dharma...
- Coming, sir.

250
00:20:08,284 --> 00:20:09,911
Let me introduce you to
people over here.

251
00:20:10,286 --> 00:20:11,844
This is Bhalla and this is Rajan.

252
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:15,754
Rajan is in-charge here.
You'll have to work under him.

253
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:19,594
l hope you will win them over
with your sincerity and hard work.

254
00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:21,928
And will not give him a chance
to complain about you.

255
00:20:22,131 --> 00:20:25,225
l won't. l'm new to this city.

256
00:20:25,801 --> 00:20:29,601
lf l make a mistake,
please forgive me.

257
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:33,400
l'm a chatterbox, l know.
But l'm good at heart.

258
00:20:33,776 --> 00:20:35,300
What am l?
- Good at heart.

259
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:39,410
l remember my mother telling me...

260
00:20:41,917 --> 00:20:42,815
Bhalla, take him away.

261
00:20:43,152 --> 00:20:44,881
Can't l finish my story?
- Not now.

262
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,920
Rajan, keep a watch on him.

263
00:20:58,033 --> 00:21:02,094
Can you tell me where
this place is?

264
00:21:07,576 --> 00:21:08,907
This is my house...

265
00:21:12,214 --> 00:21:14,375
No. This is not my house.

266
00:21:14,917 --> 00:21:16,009
Brother...

267
00:21:17,786 --> 00:21:20,755
Where are you going?
- Laxmi! What're you doing here?

268
00:21:21,423 --> 00:21:23,823
What are you looking at?
This is our house.

269
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,028
Our house...?
Then who are these people.

270
00:21:27,763 --> 00:21:31,631
We are your nabbers. This house
has been locked for a long time...

271
00:21:32,234 --> 00:21:35,260
so we thought, why not help
them in cleaning it up?

272
00:21:35,871 --> 00:21:38,965
l'm thankful to you.

273
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:41,404
But why did you take the trouble?
Radha and Laxmi were here.

274
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:45,305
That's what l told them.
But they wouldn't listen.

275
00:21:45,781 --> 00:21:48,978
We were idle while they
cleaned up this place.

276
00:21:51,654 --> 00:21:52,313
Who are you?

277
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:53,749
Devidas!

278
00:21:54,657 --> 00:21:58,252
Old goat! D'you think you'll escape
after having me arrested?

279
00:22:00,062 --> 00:22:01,461
What's happening?

280
00:22:02,131 --> 00:22:04,065
Please save my father!
Else, they will kill him.

281
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,967
Why will he kill him?
- Chandu's the local bully.

282
00:22:08,203 --> 00:22:10,569
He used to tease Aarti
every day...

283
00:22:10,773 --> 00:22:13,241
and so her father
complained to the police.

284
00:22:13,409 --> 00:22:15,809
Now that he has been released,
he won't spare Devidas.

285
00:22:16,545 --> 00:22:19,013
He teases the girls and you
don't do anything about it?

286
00:22:19,848 --> 00:22:20,542
Bash him up!

287
00:22:21,483 --> 00:22:23,246
l'll take your daughter
away in your presence.

288
00:22:23,585 --> 00:22:26,349
The name is Chandu!
- And l'm Dharma...

289
00:22:26,989 --> 00:22:28,820
and l'm your father.

290
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:30,449
Who's the father now?

291
00:22:56,952 --> 00:22:59,250
l'll show them who
the real father is.

292
00:23:32,354 --> 00:23:33,946
Listen to me carefully.

293
00:23:34,857 --> 00:23:38,691
lf you ever tease girls again,
l'll smash your face.

294
00:23:41,897 --> 00:23:45,697
Take them away.
They've spoiled my dress.

295
00:23:48,137 --> 00:23:50,731
Potent stuff, all right.
- Yes.

296
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:55,137
You have done something
no one has dared to do.

297
00:23:57,246 --> 00:23:59,544
Your daughter is like
my own sister.

298
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:02,549
And if anyone dares
to ogle at my sister...

299
00:24:02,718 --> 00:24:03,878
l will pluck out his eyes.

300
00:24:04,086 --> 00:24:05,314
What will l pluck out?
- His eyes.

301
00:24:06,822 --> 00:24:07,254
Myay you live long, son.

302
00:24:07,823 --> 00:24:09,085
Do you see the kind of
people staying here?

303
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:10,254
Listen...
- What is it?

304
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,027
Couldn't you be a bit mild
with those thugs?

305
00:24:14,463 --> 00:24:15,930
l was very mild
with the rascals.

306
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:20,127
Rubbish! You wouldn't stop,
once you started beating him up.

307
00:24:20,869 --> 00:24:22,996
Should someone die,
what will happen of us?

308
00:24:23,605 --> 00:24:26,335
Okay. l'll remember that.
But l have a condition.

309
00:24:26,775 --> 00:24:29,767
What?
- l'm hungry. Give me some food.

310
00:24:31,747 --> 00:24:33,908
Laxmi, come on inside.

311
00:24:41,223 --> 00:24:45,751
45, 48, 49,...

312
00:24:46,662 --> 00:24:50,325
and this is the fiftieth.
There are fifty boxes.

313
00:24:51,567 --> 00:24:53,432
But here it is...

314
00:24:56,572 --> 00:24:58,005
What's happened?

315
00:24:59,475 --> 00:25:01,272
Rajanbabu!

316
00:25:01,743 --> 00:25:05,042
l have a problem!
- What's the problem?

317
00:25:05,481 --> 00:25:06,470
Look at this...

318
00:25:07,683 --> 00:25:12,279
They write 25 boxes and
they load 50. How much?

319
00:25:12,688 --> 00:25:15,384
l know. Just sign here
and let the truck go.

320
00:25:16,091 --> 00:25:17,217
How can l?

321
00:25:17,693 --> 00:25:19,718
lf this delivery challan says 25,
then only 25 boxes will leave.

322
00:25:19,995 --> 00:25:21,292
Not less and no more.

323
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:22,762
What are you shouting for?

324
00:25:23,832 --> 00:25:26,733
You want a share, don't you?
...Keep this.

325
00:25:28,003 --> 00:25:29,800
What is this?
- Your share.

326
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:37,006
Share? What kind of share?
- For the extra 25 boxes.

327
00:25:37,913 --> 00:25:41,246
Are you trying to bribe me?

328
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:44,283
You're a senior,
so l keep quiet.

329
00:25:45,621 --> 00:25:47,885
l'd have bashed up
anyone else in your place.

330
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:51,453
Stop that nonsense! You talk as if
you've never stolen in your life.

331
00:25:52,394 --> 00:25:55,124
Bloody thief!
- You called me a thief!

332
00:25:55,464 --> 00:25:56,795
Leave me alone...!

333
00:25:57,165 --> 00:25:59,224
This bastard called me a thief!
l won't spare him!

334
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,440
He's a demon, Myr. Suresh.

335
00:26:15,651 --> 00:26:17,619
He would've killed me,
had you not come on time.

336
00:26:17,986 --> 00:26:20,284
You called me a thief.

337
00:26:20,923 --> 00:26:22,823
l'll kill you and if
necessary, your father too!

338
00:26:23,191 --> 00:26:27,787
Stop it, Dharma...
Stop it, l say!

339
00:26:29,898 --> 00:26:30,830
lt's not his fault.

340
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,730
Myr. Ajit had asked us
to test your loyalty.

341
00:26:34,469 --> 00:26:36,232
A test?

342
00:26:37,005 --> 00:26:41,271
Yes, and we're happy that you've
lived up to our expectations.

343
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:45,678
Myr. Ajit has promoted you as
in-charge of this godown.

344
00:26:46,448 --> 00:26:49,110
And your salary has been hiked
from rupees 400 to 600.

345
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:52,384
600 Rupees?!
- Congrats, Dharma.

346
00:26:53,388 --> 00:26:55,322
Myr. Rajan.
Please forgive me.

347
00:26:56,525 --> 00:26:59,392
l made a mistake by
raising my hands on you.

348
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:03,460
One has to sometimes get beaten up
to be a loyal man, Dharma.

349
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,462
You're a loyal man Myr. Rajan.

350
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,495
From today, our friendship
becomes stronger.

351
00:27:10,939 --> 00:27:12,099
What did l say?
- Friendship.

352
00:27:14,176 --> 00:27:15,871
Sir, what is this?

353
00:27:17,746 --> 00:27:22,410
You were so far
a temporary worker.

354
00:27:22,918 --> 00:27:26,183
Once you sign this document,
your job will become permanent.

355
00:27:28,523 --> 00:27:30,218
Where should l sign?
- Here.

356
00:27:31,026 --> 00:27:38,057
Thakur Dharamchand...

357
00:27:39,167 --> 00:27:44,002
Radha! Laxmi!
Here l am!

358
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:45,836
What happened?

359
00:27:46,174 --> 00:27:49,735
These toys are for
my little master.

360
00:27:50,545 --> 00:27:54,276
And here are the toffees...
distribute it among the children.

361
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:55,850
But what's all this about?

362
00:27:56,852 --> 00:27:59,184
This is a baba-suit
for my little master.

363
00:27:59,655 --> 00:28:00,849
Don't just stare at me.

364
00:28:01,023 --> 00:28:04,550
And this is a sari for you.

365
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,152
Wear it and let me see
how you look.

366
00:28:07,596 --> 00:28:09,325
Laxmi, what're you doing there?
Come here.

367
00:28:11,133 --> 00:28:15,229
l've brought a sari for you.
- Where did you get all this from?

368
00:28:15,604 --> 00:28:17,834
l've bought all these things.

369
00:28:18,373 --> 00:28:19,340
Do you know what happened
at the godown today?

370
00:28:20,942 --> 00:28:23,877
Myy boss was pleased with my honesty
and with the blessings of God...

371
00:28:24,713 --> 00:28:26,203
increased my salary
to 600 rupees.

372
00:28:27,549 --> 00:28:29,107
600 rupees?
- Yes.

373
00:28:29,351 --> 00:28:30,613
Really?
- Of course!

374
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:32,245
Just see what l do now.

375
00:28:32,688 --> 00:28:35,953
To begin with, l'll find
myself a white-skinned girl.

376
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:38,021
What?
- A white-skinned girl.

377
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:44,688
l'll learn English from her and
then talk to the aunt in English.

378
00:28:50,872 --> 00:28:53,238
Why're you laughing?
l've bought a sari for you too.

379
00:28:53,709 --> 00:28:55,574
For me?
- l don't wear saris, do l?

380
00:28:56,011 --> 00:28:58,002
You're more concerned
about Aarti than me.

381
00:28:58,447 --> 00:28:59,812
What are you talking uncle?

382
00:29:00,248 --> 00:29:01,806
Won't a brother be concerned
about his sister?

383
00:29:02,684 --> 00:29:05,847
Should l say something?
Fix her marriage now.

384
00:29:06,321 --> 00:29:07,583
Look, they are shy.

385
00:29:08,123 --> 00:29:11,820
lt's a sin for a girl to be
born in a poor family.

386
00:29:12,227 --> 00:29:13,023
Why?

387
00:29:14,429 --> 00:29:17,694
What do l say? She was
engaged two years ago.

388
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:23,337
l could not marry her off because
l didn't have money for the dowry.

389
00:29:23,505 --> 00:29:29,000
Don't you worry! Just finalize the
date, l'll get both the girls married.

390
00:29:30,378 --> 00:29:32,846
lf there is any honest boy
for Laxmi, then let me know.

391
00:29:33,281 --> 00:29:34,407
There is a suitor.

392
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:37,176
He's honest and comes
from a good family.

393
00:29:37,419 --> 00:29:38,317
What else do l need?

394
00:29:38,487 --> 00:29:39,977
Let's go and fix up
the date for the engagement.

395
00:29:40,388 --> 00:29:41,480
Radha, what do you say?

396
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:44,585
lf the boy is honest,
what else do we need?

397
00:29:45,293 --> 00:29:46,624
Go and seal the alliance.

398
00:29:46,962 --> 00:29:50,125
l will. But l've a condition too.

399
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:51,766
Come here...

400
00:29:53,502 --> 00:29:57,996
God has given me everything.
He gave me a little son too.

401
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,737
He brought me to this
city from the village...

402
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:01,440
and increased my salary, too.

403
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:05,409
All l want from you now
is a baby girl.

404
00:30:06,114 --> 00:30:07,172
l'll always be
indebted to you.

405
00:30:14,222 --> 00:30:19,888
lt will be our privilege if Laxmi
comes to our house as daughter-in-law.

406
00:30:21,096 --> 00:30:23,860
Dharma is a man of principles
and we revere that.

407
00:30:24,499 --> 00:30:26,057
That's like a real Thakur!

408
00:30:26,668 --> 00:30:29,193
ln the name of God then,
fix the date of engagement?

409
00:30:29,604 --> 00:30:31,663
Fix what...?
- The date of engagement.

410
00:30:59,267 --> 00:31:00,734
''Oh, sister...''

411
00:31:00,936 --> 00:31:02,995
''l will do up your palanquin''

412
00:31:06,107 --> 00:31:07,870
''Oh sister...''

413
00:31:08,109 --> 00:31:10,669
''l will do up your palanquin''

414
00:31:12,247 --> 00:31:14,772
''When the bridal entourage
leaves with you...''

415
00:31:15,016 --> 00:31:16,984
''my eyes will be misty...''

416
00:31:17,452 --> 00:31:22,048
''but l will hide my sadness
behind a smile''

417
00:31:22,924 --> 00:31:27,588
''Oh sister...
l will do up your palanquin''

418
00:31:49,117 --> 00:31:54,111
''Myy little sister
who's like a doll...''

419
00:31:56,892 --> 00:32:01,386
''Myy little sister
who's like a doll...''

420
00:32:02,197 --> 00:32:06,657
''you are the pride
of this household''

421
00:32:07,302 --> 00:32:11,500
''Once you are married...''

422
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:16,204
''you will be the
virtuous lady''

423
00:32:17,012 --> 00:32:21,574
''Oh sister...
l will do up your palanquin''

424
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:29,220
''Oh sister...
l will do up your palanquin''

425
00:32:50,979 --> 00:32:56,474
''Myay you get every joy in life''

426
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:03,357
''Myay you get every joy in life''

427
00:33:03,925 --> 00:33:08,919
''Myay you always be happy
with your husband''

428
00:33:09,364 --> 00:33:13,164
''ln that life of happiness...''

429
00:33:16,471 --> 00:33:20,805
''ln that life of happiness...''

430
00:33:21,676 --> 00:33:25,942
''do not forget us,
my dear sister''

431
00:33:26,414 --> 00:33:32,375
''Oh sister...
l will do up your palanquin''

432
00:33:42,464 --> 00:33:45,922
Brother! lf this is your
state during my engagement...

433
00:33:46,334 --> 00:33:47,961
what will happen
when l go away?

434
00:33:48,903 --> 00:33:50,063
Don't ask him.

435
00:33:50,572 --> 00:33:54,008
During our marriage, it was he
who cried more than l did!

436
00:33:54,609 --> 00:33:56,304
What were you doing?
- Shut up.

437
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:03,551
Some men go there, some there..
and the rest will come with me.

438
00:34:07,889 --> 00:34:09,083
See that nobody escapes.

439
00:34:09,758 --> 00:34:13,353
Wait, lnspector...
What's the problem?

440
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:16,329
What's in the boxes?
- Myedicines.

441
00:34:17,165 --> 00:34:18,632
Myedicines? Constable, open it up.

442
00:34:19,067 --> 00:34:21,900
Stop. l won't allow you to open
these boxes till l speak to my boss.

443
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:24,101
Don't be adamant.
Let us do our duty.

444
00:34:24,939 --> 00:34:26,634
We've information that these
boxes contain smuggled goods.

445
00:34:27,709 --> 00:34:30,872
What are you saying, lnspector?
Myy boss is a very pious man.

446
00:34:31,346 --> 00:34:33,678
These medicines are meant for
the hospitals for the poor.

447
00:34:34,049 --> 00:34:35,516
And if you open the boxes,
the medicines will get spoiled.

448
00:34:35,784 --> 00:34:37,183
Only if the medicines get spoiled?

449
00:34:37,352 --> 00:34:39,479
lf you don't trust me, you can
talk to him over the phone.

450
00:34:40,088 --> 00:34:42,852
His number is 293031 .
...what is it?

451
00:34:43,291 --> 00:34:45,418
We'll look into the matter.
Constable, do your duty.

452
00:34:46,027 --> 00:34:48,427
Please hand it carefully.

453
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:55,563
Come here.
ls this smuggled stuff?

454
00:34:56,905 --> 00:35:02,707
What do l tell my boss? Who will
pay for the damages? You or him?

455
00:35:03,411 --> 00:35:06,039
Sir, there's gold!
- Sir, there's cocaine too!

456
00:35:16,257 --> 00:35:17,224
No, sir!

457
00:35:20,495 --> 00:35:26,456
He's lying! The godown and the
seized smuggled goods belong to him.

458
00:35:27,402 --> 00:35:29,131
Listen to him talk, sir...

459
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:32,601
Will l agree if you shout
at me like this?

460
00:35:33,341 --> 00:35:37,471
Why are you telling lies? After all,
you have to face God one day.

461
00:35:38,313 --> 00:35:41,146
Dharamchand, mind your manners.
This is a court, not your home.

462
00:35:41,549 --> 00:35:43,744
l've been talking with respect
in the court and in my house.

463
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:46,917
Listen to me, sir... l don't know
what he's talking about.

464
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:50,250
l'll explain it to you, sir.

465
00:35:51,059 --> 00:35:54,995
Ajit came to our village with two of
his friends on a hunting expedition.

466
00:35:55,697 --> 00:35:58,495
And l became a guide for them.

467
00:36:00,368 --> 00:36:06,500
When the tiger attacked him,
both his friends ran away.

468
00:36:07,442 --> 00:36:13,074
lt was l who killed the tiger
and saved Myr. Ajit's life.

469
00:36:13,915 --> 00:36:19,148
He was pleased with me and
promised me a job in the city.

470
00:36:20,155 --> 00:36:22,646
l came down here from the village
with my wife and kid.

471
00:36:23,791 --> 00:36:25,986
He recruited me in this godown and
gave me a salary of 400 rupees.

472
00:36:26,394 --> 00:36:27,622
How much did l say?

473
00:36:27,896 --> 00:36:28,658
400 rupees.
- Right.

474
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:32,322
After that, he was pleased with me
and raised my salary to Rs.600.

475
00:36:32,934 --> 00:36:33,923
How much did he increase it by?

476
00:36:37,172 --> 00:36:39,003
Summon Myr. Ajit Singh
to the court.

477
00:36:51,186 --> 00:36:54,849
Greetings sir.
l said greetings, Myr. Ajit.

478
00:36:57,892 --> 00:37:02,454
l'm glad you've come.
This lawyer has gone crazy.

479
00:37:03,531 --> 00:37:09,128
He says that the godown belongs
to me and all the goods are mine.

480
00:37:10,138 --> 00:37:11,469
Tell him, sir, how is it possible?

481
00:37:12,173 --> 00:37:14,801
Now that he's here,
you've had it.

482
00:37:19,347 --> 00:37:20,314
Go ahead, boss.

483
00:37:21,216 --> 00:37:26,518
l shall speak the truth
and nothing but the truth.

484
00:37:27,322 --> 00:37:28,311
That's it.

485
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:33,587
Myr. Ajit, do you know this man?
- Yes.

486
00:37:35,296 --> 00:37:38,527
l once went to his village
on a hunting expedition.

487
00:37:38,866 --> 00:37:42,495
He saved my life from a tiger.
- Didn't l say that, sir?

488
00:37:43,137 --> 00:37:45,401
Don't speak when you're
not asked to.

489
00:37:45,673 --> 00:37:49,575
Sorry, sir... l'm not used to it.
Listen to Myr. Ajit.

490
00:37:50,178 --> 00:37:54,171
You invited him to city
because he was courageous.

491
00:37:55,917 --> 00:37:56,975
No.

492
00:37:59,621 --> 00:38:04,354
What would l do with him?
Admitted, he's a good hunter...

493
00:38:04,959 --> 00:38:07,553
but what animals would
he hunt in the city?

494
00:38:09,264 --> 00:38:10,822
He came looking for me.

495
00:38:12,133 --> 00:38:15,398
What are you saying, boss?
You brought me here from the village.

496
00:38:16,337 --> 00:38:22,333
Didn't you say l was loyal and
trustworthy. Have you forgotten that?

497
00:38:23,544 --> 00:38:27,071
Nobody has the right
to talk in between.

498
00:38:27,548 --> 00:38:29,743
l know that, sir...
l was trying to refresh his memory.

499
00:38:30,218 --> 00:38:30,843
And then?

500
00:38:32,086 --> 00:38:36,182
One day he came to me and said
he was frustrated with the village.

501
00:38:36,991 --> 00:38:39,050
He pleaded with me
to give him some work.

502
00:38:40,395 --> 00:38:41,885
For having saved my life,...

503
00:38:42,597 --> 00:38:48,968
l rented out to him a godown l had at
Chembur, without taking a single penny.

504
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:52,498
Hey! You've sworn to
speak the truth.

505
00:38:58,112 --> 00:39:02,139
What he used the godown for, once
l gave it to him, l do not know.

506
00:39:02,617 --> 00:39:05,142
He's lying, sir!
- Keep quiet, Dharma.

507
00:39:05,653 --> 00:39:10,056
How can l? He's trying to trap me.
l do not own the godown!

508
00:39:13,461 --> 00:39:17,124
This is the stamped paper he signed
while taking the godown.

509
00:39:17,799 --> 00:39:21,326
What will you show to the court,
you rascal? l'll see you myself.

510
00:39:23,771 --> 00:39:26,831
Why're you trying to implicate
me in this, you bastard?

511
00:39:27,141 --> 00:39:28,904
l won't spare you Ajit!

512
00:39:43,558 --> 00:39:49,053
Having heard all the witnesses and
considering the evidence against you...

513
00:39:50,465 --> 00:39:53,832
the court sentences Dharma to one and
a half years of rigorous imprisonment.

514
00:39:54,569 --> 00:39:59,563
For contempt of court, he is awarded
another six months imprisonment.

515
00:40:00,508 --> 00:40:02,738
No, your honor!

516
00:40:03,644 --> 00:40:06,579
This is injustice!
Myy husband is innocent.

517
00:40:07,415 --> 00:40:09,713
He hasn't done anything
wrong in his life.

518
00:40:10,385 --> 00:40:14,754
These people have implicated him.
lt's they who ought to be punished.

519
00:40:21,996 --> 00:40:29,630
Brother, where're you leaving us
and going? Say something...

520
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:36,904
Brother, what kind of court is this?
And what justice is this?

521
00:40:37,245 --> 00:40:41,978
Myy husband is innocent. l swear
on my child. Please let him go.

522
00:40:42,984 --> 00:40:45,578
l beg of you.
- No.

523
00:40:46,421 --> 00:40:51,723
l'm helpless. After the court's
verdict, l can't do anything.

524
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,550
Let's go Dharma.

525
00:41:02,236 --> 00:41:06,434
You can't fight destiny.
But you must be patient.

526
00:41:06,808 --> 00:41:07,968
God will set everything right.

527
00:41:12,146 --> 00:41:13,636
Will you please go out?

528
00:41:25,526 --> 00:41:32,398
lt's better to tell truth early
so you don't feel bad later.

529
00:41:33,601 --> 00:41:39,301
l didn't impose any conditions to
accept Laxmi as my daughter-in-law.

530
00:41:39,774 --> 00:41:43,175
l didn't bother about wealth,
caste or creed.

531
00:41:43,644 --> 00:41:48,138
Yes, the only thing l considered
was respect and honesty.

532
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:51,245
But Dharma's true identity
is now revealed.

533
00:41:51,953 --> 00:41:55,389
For wealth, he has murdered
his principles and ideals.

534
00:41:56,090 --> 00:42:02,393
Forgive me, dear, from our side,
this alliance is off.

535
00:42:03,231 --> 00:42:06,291
This marriage cannot take place.

536
00:42:38,766 --> 00:42:41,564
Dharma's silence has made
everyone uncomfortable.

537
00:42:42,904 --> 00:42:48,001
His silence is a sign
of the impending storm.

538
00:42:49,677 --> 00:42:52,407
We've got to make him speak.
But l don't know how to do it.

539
00:42:53,047 --> 00:42:57,143
What do you think, Myr. Khan?
ls Dharma really a criminal?

540
00:42:58,853 --> 00:43:03,813
Jailer, we don't have the right
to air our opinions.

541
00:43:06,427 --> 00:43:08,452
The law wants evidence and all the
evidence is loaded against Dharma.

542
00:43:09,764 --> 00:43:14,292
Anyway l've come here to tell you that
l've applied to the court to reduce...

543
00:43:14,702 --> 00:43:15,669
Dharma's imprisonment.

544
00:43:16,871 --> 00:43:20,034
lf you could help me, the court
could reduce his sentence.

545
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,284
What is it?
- Greetings.

546
00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:43,954
l came here to inquire
about your well-being.

547
00:43:45,066 --> 00:43:46,795
You've come to inquire about us
after burning our home?

548
00:43:47,568 --> 00:43:48,626
Forget what has happened.

549
00:43:49,403 --> 00:43:53,396
You sent my husband to prison,
and ask me to forget it?

550
00:43:55,409 --> 00:43:58,810
His sister's marriage got canceled
and you want me to forget that?

551
00:43:59,413 --> 00:44:02,507
ln our line of business,
going to prison is routine.

552
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:04,742
And we take all his
responsibilities.

553
00:44:05,686 --> 00:44:08,484
Two years will fly away and
you won't even know about it.

554
00:44:09,323 --> 00:44:10,483
Take this.

555
00:44:13,394 --> 00:44:16,852
God has given us the strength to
live under these conditions.

556
00:44:17,732 --> 00:44:21,031
Get out of here. And don't
ever dare come back.

557
00:44:30,678 --> 00:44:37,709
Right now you're angry. But in
poverty, money often becomes God.

558
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:42,749
Whenever you need it just remember me.
l stay at Warden Road.

559
00:44:43,457 --> 00:44:45,982
You can ask anyone there for me.
Good-bye.

560
00:44:50,698 --> 00:44:55,533
Myother...
- What happened?

561
00:44:56,570 --> 00:45:00,472
The teacher has thrown me out of
school for not paying my fees.

562
00:45:01,375 --> 00:45:03,639
Why don't you pay
the fees, mother?

563
00:45:16,257 --> 00:45:17,849
Eat this son.

564
00:45:24,498 --> 00:45:28,332
Are my clothes ready?
- Yes, aunt.

565
00:45:37,978 --> 00:45:41,937
Haven't you finished as yet?
Here's some more.

566
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:45,115
lf you can't cope with the work,
just leave this place.

567
00:46:20,521 --> 00:46:24,423
ls his wife serious?
l'll send Dharma right now.

568
00:46:29,196 --> 00:46:32,165
l don't know when the cops
will bring her husband...

569
00:46:32,566 --> 00:46:33,396
and when l will operate on her.

570
00:46:33,934 --> 00:46:36,198
Go and get these medicines
for the time being.

571
00:46:37,071 --> 00:46:39,096
How much will it cost, doctor?

572
00:46:40,074 --> 00:46:43,441
lt should cost 200 rupees.

573
00:46:43,811 --> 00:46:44,778
But since the prices have risen,
l can't say precisely.

574
00:46:49,383 --> 00:46:52,716
Look after Raju, Aarti.
l'll make some arrangements.

575
00:46:56,657 --> 00:46:58,386
Sir, this girl is here to meet you.

576
00:46:59,693 --> 00:47:02,423
Laxmi, you? Come on in.

577
00:47:06,367 --> 00:47:10,098
Myy sister-in-law is unconscious. The
doctor has asked for some medicines.

578
00:47:10,571 --> 00:47:13,404
But l don't have any money.
- Don't you worry about it.

579
00:47:14,241 --> 00:47:17,176
l came to your house
with the money.

580
00:47:17,778 --> 00:47:19,109
But your sister-in-law
wouldn't accept it.

581
00:47:19,747 --> 00:47:23,308
l know how difficult it is
to live without any money.

582
00:47:23,951 --> 00:47:26,511
Had she accepted the money, you
wouldn't have had to see this day.

583
00:47:26,954 --> 00:47:28,888
Now come on... consider this
to be your own house.

584
00:47:29,523 --> 00:47:35,655
This is all yours. Take as much
as you want. Go ahead...

585
00:47:35,996 --> 00:47:37,395
Take this.

586
00:47:38,999 --> 00:47:42,332
l don't want so much of money.
All l need is 300 rupees.

587
00:47:43,404 --> 00:47:45,804
Don't say no to the money you get.

588
00:47:46,907 --> 00:47:47,635
Take this.

589
00:47:53,447 --> 00:47:55,278
Leave me alone.

590
00:47:55,883 --> 00:47:56,747
Didn't l say you shouldn't
say no to money?

591
00:47:56,951 --> 00:47:57,815
l will shout.
- What for?

592
00:47:58,285 --> 00:47:59,411
What's there to shout about?

593
00:48:05,059 --> 00:48:09,393
Where were you for so many days, dad?
What's happened to mother?

594
00:48:09,830 --> 00:48:11,525
Take me to my mother.

595
00:48:25,145 --> 00:48:26,942
Brother...

596
00:48:33,487 --> 00:48:34,977
Brother...

597
00:48:38,192 --> 00:48:41,423
Let me be...
save sister-in-law.

598
00:48:43,264 --> 00:48:45,061
These are the medicines.

599
00:48:51,372 --> 00:48:54,500
l'm going away, brother.

600
00:48:56,977 --> 00:49:03,849
l can't be saved.
l've swallowed poison.

601
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:15,324
Yes, brother. l had gone to get some
money for sister-in-law's medicines.

602
00:49:16,463 --> 00:49:28,773
For the money he gave me...
he raped me.

603
00:49:29,076 --> 00:49:29,940
Who was it?

604
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:35,173
Who?
- Sujit.

605
00:50:01,642 --> 00:50:04,941
How did this happen?
How did she die?

606
00:50:06,814 --> 00:50:09,374
What did she say to you?
Why don't you speak?

607
00:50:15,589 --> 00:50:20,288
The operation was successful.
Your wife has been saved.

608
00:50:20,894 --> 00:50:23,260
But we're sorry, we
couldn't save the child.

609
00:50:29,269 --> 00:50:33,968
And she can never
conceive again in future.

610
00:50:39,179 --> 00:50:43,741
Doctor, was it a girl?
- Yes.

611
00:50:49,957 --> 00:50:52,357
lf you wish, you can
meet your wife.

612
00:51:52,486 --> 00:51:57,947
Because of your good behavior, you
have been released six months earlier.

613
00:52:00,928 --> 00:52:03,692
We can't return to you the
days you have spent in jail.

614
00:52:04,198 --> 00:52:06,598
But we can definitely try to see
that you have a good future.

615
00:52:07,768 --> 00:52:12,068
Come to my office at 1 1 . l've spoken
to someone for a job for you.

616
00:52:33,827 --> 00:52:38,890
Dharma, forget the past. We're
ashamed for what has happened.

617
00:52:39,566 --> 00:52:41,466
From now on, we'll do as you say.

618
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:45,965
Return my sister and
my daughter to me.

619
00:52:53,847 --> 00:52:58,011
He could be dangerous for us.
- You're right.

620
00:53:26,013 --> 00:53:27,071
So you have returned, son?

621
00:54:27,474 --> 00:54:28,338
No!

622
00:54:57,704 --> 00:55:00,605
Why didn't you come
to the office?

623
00:55:12,119 --> 00:55:13,552
Will you come tomorrow?

624
00:55:15,989 --> 00:55:17,183
Why not?

625
00:55:17,924 --> 00:55:22,224
l've spent a year and half in jail.
l'm tired.

626
00:55:24,331 --> 00:55:25,696
l need some rest.

627
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:31,829
Wait.

628
00:56:35,202 --> 00:56:38,103
Where are you going
so late in the night?

629
00:56:40,207 --> 00:56:44,075
You don't answer me
since you have returned.

630
00:56:45,112 --> 00:56:49,446
What's the matter?
And where are you going?

631
00:56:52,853 --> 00:56:54,445
Where l am going...

632
00:56:55,622 --> 00:56:57,089
What l am doing...

633
00:56:57,824 --> 00:56:59,189
And why am l doing it...

634
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:03,258
don't ever ask me that, Radha.

635
00:57:05,832 --> 00:57:08,665
Because l won't be able
to lie to you.

636
00:59:31,077 --> 00:59:33,045
Dharma! You?

637
00:59:35,048 --> 00:59:37,209
How did you come here?

638
00:59:39,319 --> 00:59:44,689
Dharma, l know that whatever
happened to you was not good.

639
00:59:46,192 --> 00:59:47,386
l apologize for that.

640
00:59:51,264 --> 00:59:53,755
l'll give you whatever you ask for.

641
00:59:54,868 --> 00:59:57,359
Any amount of money,...
l'm ready to pay you.

642
00:59:57,871 --> 00:59:59,702
Please forgive me!
- How much?

643
01:00:00,473 --> 01:00:04,466
Whatever you ask for. The safe
is full of it. Come with me.

644
01:00:06,179 --> 01:00:09,148
Look, it's full.

645
01:00:12,185 --> 01:00:12,810
Take it.

646
01:00:14,254 --> 01:00:16,984
No. l was simply taking it out...
Take as much as you want to.

647
01:00:17,290 --> 01:00:20,453
l'll take that later on.
First write a letter for me.

648
01:00:21,261 --> 01:00:22,694
Letter? What for?

649
01:00:24,297 --> 01:00:26,765
Because if you blame
me for burglary...

650
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:29,359
then l can show the
letter to the cops.

651
01:00:38,845 --> 01:00:40,107
Now write...

652
01:00:40,714 --> 01:00:43,410
that you were the one
who raped my sister.

653
01:00:45,452 --> 01:00:47,579
And write...

654
01:00:52,058 --> 01:00:54,993
that the godown for which l spent one
and a half years behind bars...

655
01:00:55,629 --> 01:00:57,620
actually belongs to you.

656
01:01:00,133 --> 01:01:02,761
lt belongs to me.

657
01:01:03,603 --> 01:01:07,801
Now put your signature
on the letter.

658
01:01:15,649 --> 01:01:17,310
Myr. Ajit.
- What is it?

659
01:01:17,517 --> 01:01:18,484
Sujit has committed suicide!

660
01:01:19,486 --> 01:01:20,453
What nonsense are you talking?

661
01:01:21,187 --> 01:01:24,088
This is rubbish! A lie!
A bloody drama!

662
01:01:24,858 --> 01:01:27,725
This is not suicide.
This is murder.

663
01:01:30,697 --> 01:01:35,691
l can't say how was he murdered.
But l can tell you the killer's name.

664
01:01:36,469 --> 01:01:40,132
Who did it?
- Dharma is the murderer.

665
01:01:43,309 --> 01:01:47,746
Where were you last night?
- Here, at home.

666
01:01:49,716 --> 01:01:53,208
Do you have any proof which can prove
that you were at home last night?

667
01:01:55,121 --> 01:01:58,557
Do you have any proof to suggest
l was not at home?

668
01:01:59,125 --> 01:02:00,456
Sujit has been murdered.

669
01:02:01,394 --> 01:02:03,259
His time must have been over.

670
01:02:05,131 --> 01:02:06,894
The time didn't end,
it was cut short.

671
01:02:09,502 --> 01:02:14,439
Let's say that it was his destiny.

672
01:02:15,308 --> 01:02:16,570
lt was his destiny.

673
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:22,040
No, somebody who wanted to change
his own destiny, murdered him.

674
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:25,879
Who is he?

675
01:02:30,924 --> 01:02:32,983
That's just what l will find out.

676
01:02:43,503 --> 01:02:50,671
Lala, the marriage of Aarti
should take place now.

677
01:02:52,412 --> 01:02:54,209
Myake arrangements for the
marriage immediately.

678
01:02:54,581 --> 01:02:59,814
Sure. But you need money
for a marriage.

679
01:03:00,153 --> 01:03:03,645
And the money comes
from the bride's side.

680
01:03:04,224 --> 01:03:07,057
l'll fix the marriage as soon as
the money is raised.

681
01:03:07,794 --> 01:03:10,319
How much money do you need?
- 10000 rupees.

682
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:14,158
l've spent that much to
make my son a doctor...

683
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:20,195
Who are you?
- Dharma.

684
01:03:46,266 --> 01:03:47,563
The deal is finalized.

685
01:03:48,334 --> 01:03:54,739
500 rupees a month?
And this is 150,000 as royalty.

686
01:03:56,276 --> 01:03:57,971
The monthly rent of
500 rupees is fine.

687
01:03:59,012 --> 01:04:00,707
But instead of 150,000 in cash,...

688
01:04:01,548 --> 01:04:06,952
if you could pay me 100,000 by check,
you will save 50000 rupees.

689
01:04:09,189 --> 01:04:12,818
Yes. But who will pay the tax
on that money? You or me?

690
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:15,152
lt's you who is going to pay.

691
01:04:15,628 --> 01:04:18,893
Where do l sign?
- Here.

692
01:04:23,102 --> 01:04:24,330
For how much did Dharma buy
the hotel from you?

693
01:04:25,438 --> 01:04:27,872
He didn't buy it. l have given it
to him for a rent of 500 rupees.

694
01:04:29,042 --> 01:04:31,670
Nobody gives a stall for 500 rupees
and you've given him a big hotel.

695
01:04:32,812 --> 01:04:34,871
lf you wish, you may check
the agreement papers.

696
01:04:35,782 --> 01:04:37,773
Do you want me to believe it
if you write even 50 rupees?

697
01:04:38,518 --> 01:04:40,543
You've taken a royalty from him.
- Not at all.

698
01:04:40,854 --> 01:04:43,118
lf he wished, he could've bought your
hotel. But he is very smart.

699
01:04:43,890 --> 01:04:45,414
He knew that he would have
been questioned...

700
01:04:45,625 --> 01:04:46,922
by the law for buying the
hotel with black money.

701
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:48,950
Both of you have made
a fake agreement.

702
01:04:49,529 --> 01:04:51,292
That's absolutely wrong.
- How much money did he pay you?

703
01:04:51,798 --> 01:04:54,562
l'm telling you the truth.
l can swear, if you want me to.

704
01:04:54,868 --> 01:04:56,961
l didn't take any money. l'm unwell
and cannot manage the hotel.

705
01:04:59,272 --> 01:04:59,966
What disease do you have?

706
01:05:00,573 --> 01:05:01,972
l've blood pressure
and heart problems.

707
01:05:02,408 --> 01:05:03,568
You can go through my medical reports.

708
01:05:06,045 --> 01:05:12,211
Myoney can buy such reports.
l wanted to make you see reason.

709
01:05:13,219 --> 01:05:15,312
You may do whatever you want to.
You may leave now.

710
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,552
The day Dharma was released....

711
01:05:23,062 --> 01:05:26,395
l could tell from his eyes that
he would have his revenge some day.

712
01:05:27,734 --> 01:05:29,565
You didn't believe me.
And see what has happened.

713
01:05:31,170 --> 01:05:35,436
He has murdered Sujit, taken away
his money and bought this hotel.

714
01:05:36,509 --> 01:05:37,498
lf that is the case...

715
01:05:37,877 --> 01:05:41,074
then l think the inspector is
also hand in glove with him.

716
01:05:42,248 --> 01:05:51,179
Let's tackle Dharma first.
We'll fix the lnspector later.

717
01:06:21,387 --> 01:06:25,448
Why're you crying?
l'm not going to die so easily.

718
01:06:27,226 --> 01:06:29,786
l've many more things to do.

719
01:06:31,197 --> 01:06:34,633
What is all this? Why have people
become your enemies?

720
01:06:35,535 --> 01:06:39,995
What wrong have you done?
Let's return to the village.

721
01:06:41,774 --> 01:06:48,407
No, Radha. lf l go back, they
will call me a coward.

722
01:06:50,917 --> 01:06:54,318
Do you want to be known
as a coward's wife.

723
01:06:55,421 --> 01:07:00,290
Everything will be all right.
Just take care of Myunna.

724
01:07:00,994 --> 01:07:03,792
You may all leave now.
He must take rest.

725
01:07:05,331 --> 01:07:07,162
Now look, brother.

726
01:07:09,435 --> 01:07:13,394
You have saved my life.
l will never forget this debt.

727
01:07:15,008 --> 01:07:18,705
Take care of them
till l am bed ridden.

728
01:07:19,445 --> 01:07:23,006
Of course, Dharma.
- Go on, Myunna.

729
01:07:25,251 --> 01:07:27,776
You may also leave, Radha.

730
01:07:28,187 --> 01:07:32,783
l won't leave you in this condition.
What if something happens to you?

731
01:07:33,860 --> 01:07:36,886
Nothing is going to happen to me.
Don't be adamant. Go home.

732
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:39,364
But why? There has to be a reason.

733
01:07:39,766 --> 01:07:42,530
There is no reason.
l told you to leave. So go away!

734
01:07:45,104 --> 01:07:46,469
And take care of Myunna.

735
01:07:51,744 --> 01:07:54,508
You're mistaken, lnspector.

736
01:07:56,416 --> 01:08:00,284
You say that we hurled a bomb at
Dharma's residence to avenge the...

737
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:01,917
murder of our friend, Sujit.

738
01:08:02,221 --> 01:08:06,021
You know very well that we are
honest businessmen.

739
01:08:06,793 --> 01:08:10,524
Myoreover we don't have
any police records.

740
01:08:15,168 --> 01:08:20,572
All right. You're honest and don't
figure in any police record.

741
01:08:22,175 --> 01:08:24,405
Myake sure you try to be like
this in future too.

742
01:08:30,249 --> 01:08:33,650
lnspector, thanks for
that courteous threat.

743
01:08:45,298 --> 01:08:48,392
This is Suresh's house.
Keep an eye on it.

744
01:08:49,469 --> 01:08:50,663
Dharma may try to come here.

745
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:16,628
Recognize me?

746
01:09:21,767 --> 01:09:25,430
Why have you come here?
- Why are you scared?

747
01:09:26,539 --> 01:09:27,369
Because you're a murderer.

748
01:09:28,474 --> 01:09:30,465
You murdered Sujit.
- No.

749
01:09:31,611 --> 01:09:34,739
The police say he committed suicide.
- This is a lie.

750
01:09:35,648 --> 01:09:37,946
Then what is the truth?
- l don't know.

751
01:09:39,152 --> 01:09:40,585
But what do you want from me?

752
01:09:41,554 --> 01:09:46,082
l want the price for the
time l spent in jail.

753
01:09:47,727 --> 01:09:50,423
What does that mean?
- You know that.

754
01:09:51,731 --> 01:09:53,221
How much money do you want?

755
01:09:54,167 --> 01:09:55,930
All that is stashed away
in the safe.

756
01:09:57,103 --> 01:10:00,436
Yes. But you must remain here.

757
01:10:12,618 --> 01:10:14,916
l said all that stashed
away in the safe.

758
01:10:22,195 --> 01:10:26,723
Take this. Now go away.
- No way.

759
01:10:27,867 --> 01:10:29,459
Why not?

760
01:10:33,573 --> 01:10:34,938
Sit down.

761
01:10:38,444 --> 01:10:41,413
l want to do business with
you with this money.

762
01:10:42,882 --> 01:10:43,746
Why?

763
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:49,380
l'll tell you.
Won't you offer me some whiskey?

764
01:11:14,513 --> 01:11:15,980
Go ahead.

765
01:11:20,486 --> 01:11:24,980
l want to invest this money in
the business with you because...

766
01:11:26,626 --> 01:11:28,355
you're an honest man.

767
01:11:34,333 --> 01:11:38,929
You don't believe me?
- No. lt's not that.

768
01:11:40,473 --> 01:11:45,809
You're the most honest man
among the three of you.

769
01:11:47,913 --> 01:11:52,441
Now you will tell me how you
manage your business?

770
01:12:02,128 --> 01:12:05,495
Once our goods arrive,...

771
01:12:06,732 --> 01:12:10,896
we invest our money and sell it
later at double the price.

772
01:12:11,637 --> 01:12:15,801
When the goods are seized then it's
the problem of the carrier.

773
01:12:18,644 --> 01:12:21,010
So that's the problem of carrier.

774
01:12:21,981 --> 01:12:25,007
But when the stuff is
seized in the godowns...

775
01:12:25,918 --> 01:12:28,682
you implicate innocent people
like myself.

776
01:12:29,989 --> 01:12:33,516
This is business and
everything goes.

777
01:12:34,694 --> 01:12:37,026
But we do compensate
for the damage done.

778
01:12:37,463 --> 01:12:42,196
Didn't we send money to your house
when you were behind bars?

779
01:12:43,869 --> 01:12:46,804
Forget the past Myr. Suresh.

780
01:12:48,374 --> 01:12:52,333
Tell me when we start work.
- Whenever you wish.

781
01:12:54,046 --> 01:13:01,953
l want to start right now.

782
01:13:39,392 --> 01:13:42,725
He had fallen before l came.
l think he drank one too many.

783
01:13:44,130 --> 01:13:47,065
We've got to inform the police.
Let's call the lnspector General.

784
01:13:51,971 --> 01:13:54,269
lnspector, Suresh has fallen
from the stairs and died.

785
01:13:55,107 --> 01:13:56,472
He was drunk and fell down.

786
01:13:57,843 --> 01:13:59,242
He died because he fell
after being drunk?

787
01:13:59,712 --> 01:14:00,576
Stay put, l'm coming over.

788
01:14:45,191 --> 01:14:46,488
Constable!

789
01:14:47,275 --> 01:14:48,207
Are you on duty?

790
01:14:48,743 --> 01:14:50,074
ls this how you do your duty?

791
01:14:50,912 --> 01:14:53,039
Did you see Dharma going out?
- Not as yet.

792
01:15:21,810 --> 01:15:23,641
How did the blood start flowing?

793
01:15:24,346 --> 01:15:29,443
l've got a wound on my back.
lt's but natural that l bleed.

794
01:15:30,619 --> 01:15:31,984
Suresh has been killed.

795
01:15:32,387 --> 01:15:37,017
Good riddance. Another sinner
leaves the earth.

796
01:15:38,026 --> 01:15:41,325
This time, too, people
suspect you for the crime.

797
01:15:43,765 --> 01:15:46,165
How about you?

798
01:15:46,768 --> 01:15:51,137
Myere suspicion isn't enough
for the law. We need evidence.

799
01:15:51,773 --> 01:15:53,035
Have you got any?

800
01:15:53,441 --> 01:15:56,740
lf l had the proof, by this time
l would have handcuffed you.

801
01:15:57,946 --> 01:16:03,077
So go and get the proof first.
Talk to me later.

802
01:16:04,052 --> 01:16:07,021
This time around,
you need real evidence.

803
01:16:07,656 --> 01:16:09,988
Not trumped up charges
like the last time.

804
01:16:10,225 --> 01:16:12,489
l know you're not interested
in what l am telling you.

805
01:16:12,727 --> 01:16:15,423
But you will repent when you
recall my words in the future.

806
01:16:15,630 --> 01:16:19,623
You will want to run away from life,
but circumstances won't allow you to.

807
01:16:27,509 --> 01:16:32,640
The police say he died after slipping
from the stairs in a drunken state.

808
01:16:34,182 --> 01:16:35,149
No!

809
01:16:44,192 --> 01:16:48,151
lf l get a chance to go to London,
l'll become a famous surgeon.

810
01:16:49,998 --> 01:16:55,834
l'll make the necessary arrangements.
l'll bear your expenses, too.

811
01:16:57,005 --> 01:16:58,632
But you will have to
do something for me.

812
01:16:58,974 --> 01:17:00,271
What is it, brother?

813
01:17:00,842 --> 01:17:03,572
Raju will also go with you.
He'll study there, too.

814
01:17:04,946 --> 01:17:09,007
That's a good idea.
We'll treat him like our own child.

815
01:17:10,018 --> 01:17:13,112
Very well. Myake arrangements
for your departure.

816
01:17:13,989 --> 01:17:15,980
No. l won't allow Raju to go!

817
01:17:16,591 --> 01:17:21,028
Please do not snatch my child
from me. l plead with you!

818
01:17:21,696 --> 01:17:24,221
Look Radha...
- That's why you brought me here.

819
01:17:24,599 --> 01:17:26,294
Everything has been ruined.

820
01:17:27,535 --> 01:17:30,800
l had a miscarriage and lost
a daughter like Laxmi.

821
01:17:31,439 --> 01:17:36,467
And now you're snatching Raju from me.
Don't be so cruel. l beg of you!

822
01:17:36,878 --> 01:17:40,814
What are you doing, Radha?
Raju's life is in danger here.

823
01:17:41,516 --> 01:17:45,145
What if something happens to him?
- No. Nothing should happen to him.

824
01:17:45,653 --> 01:17:50,488
l'll keep him close to my heart.
l won't let anyone harm him.

825
01:17:52,727 --> 01:17:54,524
Why don't you understand?

826
01:17:55,663 --> 01:17:57,790
Raju's presence here
will tie my hands.

827
01:17:58,133 --> 01:17:59,657
l'd never be able
to take them on.

828
01:18:00,535 --> 01:18:01,695
And what if l lose my life...

829
01:18:01,970 --> 01:18:07,408
Please don't say such things.
- Then let Raju go.

830
01:18:09,444 --> 01:18:11,639
l can't live without Raju.

831
01:18:20,889 --> 01:18:25,383
Tell Myr. Rajan that l'm going
out for a few months.

832
01:18:27,195 --> 01:18:28,787
And tell him that
before l come back...

833
01:18:28,963 --> 01:18:30,988
he must eliminate Dharma.

834
01:18:43,878 --> 01:18:45,539
Myr. Ajit.

835
01:18:47,982 --> 01:18:51,008
Dharma, how did you get here?

836
01:18:52,821 --> 01:18:56,450
Now look; l am not responsible
for whatever has happened to you.

837
01:18:57,125 --> 01:18:58,490
lt was Suresh and Sujit!

838
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:00,957
You did a great thing
by killing them!

839
01:19:01,262 --> 01:19:05,722
Had l known that Sujit
had raped your sister...

840
01:19:06,067 --> 01:19:08,058
l would've killed him
before you did.

841
01:19:09,737 --> 01:19:12,001
Don't you trust me?

842
01:19:15,507 --> 01:19:17,160
Then take me to any court.

843
01:19:17,108 --> 01:19:22,034
l'll confess to the injustice
meted out to you.

844
01:19:22,519 --> 01:19:26,132
Are you ready to go to the court?
- Yes.

845
01:19:27,301 --> 01:19:30,566
That court will only pronounce you
a criminal.

846
01:19:32,339 --> 01:19:38,407
But Dharma's court gives a verdict
of a death sentence for you.

847
01:19:38,712 --> 01:19:41,508
No, Dharma!

848
01:19:59,433 --> 01:20:03,130
Stop! l want peace!

849
01:20:03,437 --> 01:20:04,699
l'm a friend...
not an enemy.

850
01:20:09,228 --> 01:20:10,661
l've heard about you.

851
01:20:12,097 --> 01:20:14,429
You have single-handedly
eliminated the three of them.

852
01:20:14,933 --> 01:20:17,663
You are a courageous man and
l respect you for that.

853
01:20:18,937 --> 01:20:22,464
The three of them worked for me.
Will you work for me, too?

854
01:20:23,408 --> 01:20:24,739
l'll make you the boss here.

855
01:20:27,779 --> 01:20:31,044
Don't you worry. l won't betray
you like they did.

856
01:20:31,950 --> 01:20:32,882
Will you work for me?

857
01:20:36,021 --> 01:20:37,283
Come on.

858
01:21:01,313 --> 01:21:03,144
The consignment is
still in the sea.

859
01:21:04,616 --> 01:21:06,516
lt's been lying in the sea
for the last one week.

860
01:21:07,586 --> 01:21:08,917
l think we must take it out now.

861
01:21:10,255 --> 01:21:13,349
Or else, it'll either get spoilt
or someone else will steal it.

862
01:21:15,794 --> 01:21:17,728
What's the consignment worth?
- 2 million.

863
01:21:19,564 --> 01:21:21,293
Let it remain there.
- What?

864
01:21:23,335 --> 01:21:26,532
Let the consignment remain there till
MylSA is withdrawn in the country.

865
01:21:26,805 --> 01:21:28,932
lf you permit, the consignment
can be taken out.

866
01:21:30,809 --> 01:21:35,576
Narang is an expert at it.
- Yes... it's very easy.

867
01:21:37,582 --> 01:21:40,574
And what if we're caught?
- That will never happen.

868
01:21:41,153 --> 01:21:44,953
Even if it does, the police will never
get to know who owns the consignment.

869
01:21:57,903 --> 01:22:01,100
You know that l run this
business under your name.

870
01:22:03,642 --> 01:22:07,339
There're many cases pending
against you in the court.

871
01:22:08,814 --> 01:22:12,944
l don't want the police to
arrest you under MylSA.

872
01:22:14,953 --> 01:22:19,083
So stop the business
for the time being.

873
01:22:30,335 --> 01:22:32,394
Myy daughter has grown up.

874
01:22:34,406 --> 01:22:38,137
Yes, Rajan. l haven't
forgotten my word.

875
01:22:39,678 --> 01:22:42,579
Your daughter will come to my
house as my daughter-in-law.

876
01:22:49,988 --> 01:22:51,819
Good night, sister-in-law.

877
01:23:03,568 --> 01:23:06,594
Don't work till late in the night.
After all health is wealth.

878
01:23:07,172 --> 01:23:09,538
l always pray
for your good health.

879
01:23:10,142 --> 01:23:13,373
And why not? You've given us
shelter in your house.

880
01:23:14,713 --> 01:23:17,273
Had Birbal's father been alive today,
he would've been very happy.

881
01:23:17,849 --> 01:23:20,682
Don't take on so much responsibility
of work. What are the servants for?

882
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:25,456
You know how he is. He believes
in doing everything on his own.

883
01:23:26,191 --> 01:23:28,421
That's right. lf you don't work,
your servants will swindle you.

884
01:23:28,860 --> 01:23:32,057
You're right Myom. There
was this case in court...

885
01:23:33,231 --> 01:23:34,391
Come on. Let them take rest.

886
01:23:35,033 --> 01:23:39,663
l wish you'd complete your
studies in law and help Dharma.

887
01:23:39,738 --> 01:23:41,205
He's such a kind-soul.
God bless him...

888
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:56,948
Listen.

889
01:23:58,290 --> 01:24:00,918
The house is so silent.

890
01:24:02,093 --> 01:24:05,358
l've been bearing it for
the last 20 years.

891
01:24:06,097 --> 01:24:07,257
l can't bear it anymore.

892
01:24:07,899 --> 01:24:12,529
Why don't you call Raju back?
- Never.

893
01:24:13,538 --> 01:24:14,266
Why not?

894
01:24:15,474 --> 01:24:18,272
You go away to London to spend
two months with him every year.

895
01:24:18,477 --> 01:24:23,210
And you miss him for
the rest of the 10 months.

896
01:24:24,983 --> 01:24:29,181
But should he come here,
you won't look after me.

897
01:24:31,056 --> 01:24:32,887
You won't know how a mother feels.

898
01:24:34,759 --> 01:24:37,557
Sure. As if a father
has no feelings.

899
01:24:38,930 --> 01:24:40,420
Here you are...

900
01:24:42,667 --> 01:24:45,295
ls Raju really coming tomorrow?!

901
01:25:33,685 --> 01:25:35,619
Who is that girl?
Do you know her?

902
01:25:37,856 --> 01:25:39,517
No.

903
01:25:56,141 --> 01:25:59,838
The boy's smart. But will he able
to manage his father's business?

904
01:26:01,079 --> 01:26:04,537
l've thought it over before
choosing him for my daughter.

905
01:26:50,762 --> 01:26:52,423
The consignment has been seized.

906
01:26:52,797 --> 01:26:54,958
A warrant has been
issued in Amrit's name.

907
01:26:56,935 --> 01:27:03,033
l had sent Deepak as Amrit to Delhi
by the morning flight.

908
01:27:03,842 --> 01:27:05,776
He should be back
by the evening flight.

909
01:27:06,711 --> 01:27:10,374
The police will have to believe
that Amrit was in Delhi for the day.

910
01:27:38,209 --> 01:27:39,676
Why get upset?

911
01:27:40,845 --> 01:27:43,006
After all, he belongs to you.
- But aunt...

912
01:27:43,348 --> 01:27:48,843
Today he is dancing with her.
After marriage you can make him dance.

913
01:28:02,901 --> 01:28:05,802
How are you?
- l'm fine.

914
01:28:06,271 --> 01:28:07,033
Come on.

915
01:28:07,639 --> 01:28:09,869
After years, l've been
transferred back to this city.

916
01:28:10,942 --> 01:28:13,433
l came uninvited when l got
to know about the party.

917
01:28:13,578 --> 01:28:14,909
l knew you would
never invite me.

918
01:28:18,783 --> 01:28:20,011
When did you come?

919
01:28:20,852 --> 01:28:22,786
Yesterday. l was transferred
from Nagpur to Bombay.

920
01:28:23,555 --> 01:28:25,580
ls everyone okay at home?
- Yes. With your blessings.

921
01:28:26,691 --> 01:28:28,784
Congratulations on your son's return.
- Thank you.

922
01:28:29,694 --> 01:28:31,889
Please sit down.
l'll get something for you.

923
01:28:41,673 --> 01:28:43,937
You son looks just like you.

924
01:28:45,410 --> 01:28:48,106
But see that he doesn't follow
in your footsteps.

925
01:28:52,217 --> 01:28:53,377
Soda or water?

926
01:28:58,723 --> 01:28:59,917
Water.

927
01:29:08,933 --> 01:29:10,025
Didn't you go to sleep?

928
01:29:10,869 --> 01:29:13,099
Who was that girl whom you
went to see off?

929
01:29:13,872 --> 01:29:15,863
l went to see off?
Whom did l go to see off?

930
01:29:16,741 --> 01:29:19,938
Don't try to fool me.
The girl you went out with.

931
01:29:20,578 --> 01:29:26,016
Oh... that was a girl.

932
01:29:32,891 --> 01:29:38,761
l know. But how did you
meet her? When and how?

933
01:29:40,031 --> 01:29:44,127
Even the cops in London don't
ask questions like you.

934
01:29:45,103 --> 01:29:46,161
Won't you tell me?

935
01:29:46,604 --> 01:29:49,801
l met her in London.
She was my classmate.

936
01:29:51,543 --> 01:29:53,272
And?
- And what?

937
01:29:53,578 --> 01:29:57,309
Nothing more? You're not lying?
- No.

938
01:30:00,118 --> 01:30:03,679
You looked at her as if...
- As if...?

939
01:30:05,190 --> 01:30:06,157
Well...

940
01:30:07,559 --> 01:30:10,323
You don't think we're
going steady, do you?

941
01:30:10,829 --> 01:30:12,524
You're so old fashioned, mom!

942
01:30:13,031 --> 01:30:14,328
ln London, all this is very normal.

943
01:30:14,532 --> 01:30:17,296
Boy meets girl. Girl meets boy. Girl
comes to the boy's house for a party.

944
01:30:17,702 --> 01:30:22,196
After that, boy goes to see her off
and boy's mother questions him.

945
01:30:24,542 --> 01:30:27,136
Myother, l'm sleepy.

946
01:30:29,247 --> 01:30:30,578
Look carefully at this.

947
01:30:30,815 --> 01:30:32,305
Was it the same man who asked you
to take the consignment?

948
01:30:33,218 --> 01:30:34,685
Yes, lnspector.

949
01:30:35,553 --> 01:30:39,182
You're lying. He was in
Delhi the day we seized...

950
01:30:39,858 --> 01:30:40,688
the consignment from your truck.

951
01:30:40,959 --> 01:30:42,017
Tell me. Whose consignment was it?

952
01:30:42,327 --> 01:30:43,760
lt was his, lnspector.

953
01:30:44,729 --> 01:30:48,096
Answer us properly or
you'll land in prison!

954
01:30:49,267 --> 01:30:50,427
lf l go behind bars,...

955
01:30:51,269 --> 01:30:54,329
l will kill this man!

956
01:31:02,180 --> 01:31:05,513
l have a suggestion.
Let this man out on bail.

957
01:31:05,884 --> 01:31:08,648
But sir...
- lt'll be my responsibility.

958
01:31:13,458 --> 01:31:17,656
Go on. You wanted to
say something to me.

959
01:31:18,529 --> 01:31:24,024
Gopal has been granted bail and
he has threatened to kill Narang.

960
01:31:25,637 --> 01:31:27,867
This man can prove to
be dangerous for us.

961
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:30,671
We'll have to do
something about him.

962
01:31:38,583 --> 01:31:41,916
We're sorry that Narang didn't
inform you about the goods.

963
01:31:43,454 --> 01:31:51,589
We'll take care of your parents and
family. They won't face any problem.

964
01:31:52,764 --> 01:31:55,426
Just take this blame on yourself.

965
01:31:56,734 --> 01:32:01,933
When you return, we'll give you enough
money to start your own business.

966
01:32:04,676 --> 01:32:07,611
Did you understand...?
Why are you quiet?

967
01:32:19,023 --> 01:32:22,515
Tell Narang to accept the blame.

968
01:32:24,629 --> 01:32:26,722
And leave this man alone.

969
01:32:27,098 --> 01:32:29,032
But why do you have a
soft-corner for this man?

970
01:32:30,268 --> 01:32:33,396
lf you try to make a criminal
out of an innocent man...

971
01:32:34,539 --> 01:32:37,736
it will lead to the
birth of another Dharma.

972
01:32:46,284 --> 01:32:47,546
What's your name?

973
01:32:49,253 --> 01:32:54,247
Look Gopal, never take a wrong
step in your life.

974
01:32:55,893 --> 01:33:02,856
Should you need anything, come to me.
Myy name is Dharamchand.

975
01:33:03,167 --> 01:33:06,364
lt's the truth!
The consignment belongs to me!

976
01:33:07,472 --> 01:33:11,875
You have a family, Myr. Narang.

977
01:33:12,377 --> 01:33:13,776
You must care for them and
not get involved in this.

978
01:33:14,078 --> 01:33:15,136
Tell me whose consignment it was.

979
01:33:15,380 --> 01:33:17,974
l've told so many times
that it belongs to me.

980
01:33:18,316 --> 01:33:20,341
You're lying!
lt belongs to Dharamchand!

981
01:33:20,718 --> 01:33:21,946
Dharamchand who?

982
01:33:23,654 --> 01:33:26,487
So you don't know
who Dharamchand is?

983
01:33:27,825 --> 01:33:32,125
The same man who has trapped fools
like you and evaded the law.

984
01:33:32,663 --> 01:33:36,121
l'm asking you for the last time.
Whose consignment is it?

985
01:33:37,101 --> 01:33:39,934
l've told so many times
that it belongs to me.

986
01:33:41,472 --> 01:33:42,530
So you won't relent.

987
01:33:43,107 --> 01:33:44,506
Constable, take him away.

988
01:33:46,778 --> 01:33:48,769
l don't understand this.

989
01:33:49,180 --> 01:33:52,274
He sympathized with an ordinary
truck driver and let him go...

990
01:33:52,683 --> 01:33:55,243
and had Narang thrown in a cell.

991
01:33:55,987 --> 01:33:57,978
ls Dharma trying to
eliminate us...

992
01:33:58,356 --> 01:34:02,725
and lead a normal life after
the return of his son...?

993
01:34:02,927 --> 01:34:05,225
No, Myr. Singh.
That will never happen.

994
01:34:06,064 --> 01:34:09,932
l'm giving you a warning
of what is to happen.

995
01:34:10,835 --> 01:34:14,896
And when the time comes,
l'll remind you again.

996
01:34:21,345 --> 01:34:23,813
We're thankful to Dharamchand...

997
01:34:24,182 --> 01:34:28,710
for building this charitable
hospital for the poor.

998
01:34:29,787 --> 01:34:33,621
Should there be some more
philanthropists like him in the city,

999
01:34:34,459 --> 01:34:41,023
all the needs of the poor
would be fulfilled.

1000
01:34:42,066 --> 01:34:44,762
We thank him and pray...

1001
01:34:45,169 --> 01:34:51,039
that the departed soul
of his sister rests in peace...

1002
01:34:51,342 --> 01:34:54,402
in whose memory this hospital
has been inaugurated.

1003
01:35:18,703 --> 01:35:23,333
You've been following me
for the last two days.

1004
01:35:23,741 --> 01:35:25,140
The problem is...
- Who are you?

1005
01:35:27,979 --> 01:35:32,177
l'll explain, son. You're new to
the city. They're only your friends...

1006
01:35:32,583 --> 01:35:37,213
l don't need them.
Ask them not to follow me.

1007
01:36:11,088 --> 01:36:16,185
What's your problem? l told you
l don't need any bodyguards.

1008
01:36:16,961 --> 01:36:23,594
You're new to this place...
- No, l don't need you.

1009
01:37:04,008 --> 01:37:07,444
''Having stayed away
from you...''

1010
01:37:10,181 --> 01:37:13,309
''Having stayed away
from you...''

1011
01:37:13,784 --> 01:37:19,484
''l have come to realize
what love is''

1012
01:37:20,324 --> 01:37:26,194
''l have come to realize
what a beloved is''

1013
01:37:29,634 --> 01:37:33,593
''Having stayed away
from you...''

1014
01:37:35,506 --> 01:37:39,173
''Having stayed away
from you...''

1015
01:37:39,410 --> 01:37:45,076
''l have come to know
what love is''

1016
01:37:45,816 --> 01:37:50,981
''l have realized
what a beloved is''

1017
01:37:53,291 --> 01:37:58,820
''Having stayed away from you...''

1018
01:38:27,391 --> 01:38:31,851
''Why should there be
any distances...''

1019
01:38:32,163 --> 01:38:34,290
''now that we meet?''

1020
01:38:34,532 --> 01:38:40,027
''Let our desires be
fulfilled, my love''

1021
01:38:40,304 --> 01:38:46,334
''Let our desires
be fulfilled, my love''

1022
01:38:47,278 --> 01:38:53,046
''These distances will be no more,
when the time comes''

1023
01:38:53,384 --> 01:38:59,152
''We will face no more
obstacles from society''

1024
01:38:59,924 --> 01:39:06,796
''When we face no more
helplessness''

1025
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:13,596
''Having been away from you...''

1026
01:39:19,343 --> 01:39:25,009
''l have come to know
what love is''

1027
01:39:25,950 --> 01:39:31,616
''l have realized
what a beloved is''

1028
01:39:33,157 --> 01:39:38,754
''Having been away
from you...''

1029
01:39:39,463 --> 01:39:45,060
''Having been away from you...''

1030
01:39:58,849 --> 01:40:02,785
This is terrible, Raju.
They're following us around like cops.

1031
01:40:03,854 --> 01:40:06,755
You're right.
l'll have do something.

1032
01:40:12,630 --> 01:40:15,064
Did you speak to your father
about our marriage?

1033
01:40:15,266 --> 01:40:16,961
Daddy? Do you want me killed?
- Why?

1034
01:40:17,635 --> 01:40:20,331
l'm scared of my dad. Why don't
you speak to your father?

1035
01:40:21,238 --> 01:40:23,536
As if girls discuss their
wedding with their parents!

1036
01:40:24,508 --> 01:40:26,442
Right. They don't.

1037
01:40:27,077 --> 01:40:28,271
Come on.
- Where to?

1038
01:40:28,479 --> 01:40:29,503
To my mother.

1039
01:40:29,680 --> 01:40:31,910
You will tell her that
you love me...

1040
01:40:32,116 --> 01:40:35,984
and that you can't live without me.
''Please get us married''

1041
01:40:36,220 --> 01:40:38,552
Somebody has rightly said, a
tall man has his brains in his heels.

1042
01:40:38,823 --> 01:40:42,315
Great! lf the head rolls,
one can use the heel to think!

1043
01:40:42,893 --> 01:40:44,793
Come on!
- You've gone mad.

1044
01:40:45,229 --> 01:40:47,663
ldiot! lt's parents who
discuss marriage.

1045
01:40:48,532 --> 01:40:53,026
Myy father will meet your father
when he returns from Srinagar.

1046
01:40:53,571 --> 01:40:55,766
Do you understand?
- Yes.

1047
01:40:56,407 --> 01:40:58,705
This is my first marriage, you see.
l won't repeat this mistake again.

1048
01:41:09,720 --> 01:41:12,621
What's the matter, son?
- Nothing.

1049
01:41:13,224 --> 01:41:17,024
Tell me, what's the matter?
- l've been thinking.

1050
01:41:17,628 --> 01:41:18,492
What were you thinking about?

1051
01:41:19,730 --> 01:41:23,131
You've been staying all alone
in this mansion.

1052
01:41:23,834 --> 01:41:25,199
You must be getting bored.

1053
01:41:26,437 --> 01:41:29,304
Not at all.
There are so many servants here.

1054
01:41:30,007 --> 01:41:34,944
What will the servants do?
Now you need someone of your own.

1055
01:41:36,413 --> 01:41:40,850
Someone who can help you
and talk to you.

1056
01:41:41,652 --> 01:41:43,813
You're back now.

1057
01:41:44,154 --> 01:41:47,248
What will l do? l can't be with
you round the clock, can l?

1058
01:41:48,025 --> 01:41:52,894
Yes. l was thinking of calling
my aunt from the village.

1059
01:41:54,131 --> 01:42:00,263
Why must you want those old folks?
...why don't you understand?

1060
01:42:00,971 --> 01:42:06,238
Sure, l do understand. Why don't you
say that you want to get married.

1061
01:42:06,577 --> 01:42:09,774
No, mother. l don't want to
get married. l'm in no hurry.

1062
01:42:11,315 --> 01:42:14,113
lt's you l am really
worried about.

1063
01:42:14,585 --> 01:42:17,577
Okay. l'll tell your father to
make arrangements for your marriage...

1064
01:42:17,821 --> 01:42:19,482
with Rajan's daughter, Pinky.

1065
01:42:21,892 --> 01:42:24,360
Pinky?
- Rajan's daughter.

1066
01:42:25,696 --> 01:42:29,655
l don't know any Pinky.
l was talking about Geeta.

1067
01:42:31,168 --> 01:42:32,465
The girl who came to the party.

1068
01:42:33,337 --> 01:42:35,965
We don't even know her.
- But l do.

1069
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:37,937
And l'm the one who's
going to get married.

1070
01:42:38,108 --> 01:42:39,905
Please talk to father
about Geeta.

1071
01:42:41,345 --> 01:42:42,243
What if he doesn't agree?

1072
01:42:42,846 --> 01:42:46,907
You ask him to and he won't agree?
How can that ever happen?

1073
01:42:48,319 --> 01:42:50,981
l'll try.

1074
01:42:56,193 --> 01:42:58,252
No. This is impossible.

1075
01:43:00,464 --> 01:43:02,898
Raju will marry
Rajan's daughter.

1076
01:43:03,467 --> 01:43:06,129
They've known each other
for a long time.

1077
01:43:06,470 --> 01:43:10,065
They've been studying together
and they're in love.

1078
01:43:10,374 --> 01:43:12,274
But l've given my word to Rajan.

1079
01:43:12,543 --> 01:43:15,171
And everyone knows that
l never break my promise.

1080
01:43:21,485 --> 01:43:25,353
Raju hasn't come for
dinner even today.

1081
01:43:26,924 --> 01:43:28,482
He hasn't eaten for two days.

1082
01:43:28,759 --> 01:43:31,284
Neither does he talk to anyone
nor does he go out.

1083
01:43:33,130 --> 01:43:36,691
Why be adamant over things
that are not possible?

1084
01:43:40,270 --> 01:43:42,864
He's going back to
London tomorrow.

1085
01:43:43,140 --> 01:43:46,473
What will we do if he
marries Geeta there?

1086
01:43:47,845 --> 01:43:50,780
She's right. And Raju is right, too.

1087
01:43:51,148 --> 01:43:53,480
How can he marry Pinky when
he doesn't even know her?

1088
01:43:54,785 --> 01:44:00,087
l've promised Rajan that
Pinky will marry Raju.

1089
01:44:00,457 --> 01:44:04,188
That was in days when children
listened to their parents.

1090
01:44:04,461 --> 01:44:08,295
Today if we don't listen to them,
they might commit suicide.

1091
01:44:08,666 --> 01:44:10,600
Aunt!

1092
01:44:41,065 --> 01:44:42,555
''He's leaving for London tomorrow''

1093
01:44:43,634 --> 01:44:47,297
''What will we do if he
marries Geeta there?''

1094
01:44:48,205 --> 01:44:51,072
''How can he marry Pinky when
he doesn't even know her?''

1095
01:44:51,909 --> 01:44:55,538
''That was in days when children
listened to their parents''

1096
01:44:56,346 --> 01:45:00,180
''Today we don't listen to them,
they might even commit suicide''

1097
01:45:06,457 --> 01:45:13,454
Tell Raju that l would like
to meet Geeta's father.

1098
01:45:15,432 --> 01:45:19,698
What does that mean?
You're ready for the alliance?

1099
01:45:28,145 --> 01:45:29,908
What happened, mother?
You called me.

1100
01:45:30,647 --> 01:45:32,478
Did you speak to father?
What did he say?

1101
01:45:36,153 --> 01:45:38,587
Looks like you didn't put
up my case properly.

1102
01:45:38,956 --> 01:45:41,254
l did. But he wouldn't agree.

1103
01:45:41,492 --> 01:45:43,426
Why didn't you say that
you like her and...

1104
01:45:43,660 --> 01:45:45,093
she is worthy of becoming
your daughter-in-law?

1105
01:45:45,496 --> 01:45:49,227
l tried everything.
- Did you tell that even l like her?

1106
01:45:50,033 --> 01:45:52,228
l did. But he didn't agree.

1107
01:45:53,670 --> 01:45:55,729
So why didn't you say that
if Raju is not married to Geeta...

1108
01:45:55,973 --> 01:45:57,600
then he wouldn't marry
any other girl.

1109
01:45:58,308 --> 01:46:02,244
l said that too.
He said that's all right.

1110
01:46:02,613 --> 01:46:06,014
Go and tell him that Raju
will swallow poison and...

1111
01:46:06,316 --> 01:46:10,184
Shut up. Don't talk like that.
Poisoned be your enemies!

1112
01:46:11,421 --> 01:46:13,912
He said...
- What?

1113
01:46:15,492 --> 01:46:16,857
''Yes''

1114
01:46:17,861 --> 01:46:20,625
Myom! You've done it!

1115
01:46:40,350 --> 01:46:41,612
Any luck?

1116
01:46:47,891 --> 01:46:48,983
Has your father agreed?

1117
01:46:50,460 --> 01:46:51,688
You mustn't have done your best.

1118
01:46:51,929 --> 01:46:55,695
l did. So much so that
l was shaken, but not him.

1119
01:46:59,703 --> 01:47:01,671
You should've sought
your mother's help?

1120
01:47:01,872 --> 01:47:02,896
l did.
- Then?

1121
01:47:03,073 --> 01:47:05,303
He didn't listen to her either.

1122
01:47:06,243 --> 01:47:09,007
You should've told him
that we love each other.

1123
01:47:09,479 --> 01:47:11,709
l did. But he came after
me with a stick.

1124
01:47:12,282 --> 01:47:14,147
He said people bring Brit girls
from London...

1125
01:47:14,518 --> 01:47:16,110
and l've returned
with native stuff.

1126
01:47:16,620 --> 01:47:18,212
You mustn't have asked
what l lack!

1127
01:47:18,622 --> 01:47:21,591
l did. He said he could tell if there
were a couple of wrong things.

1128
01:47:21,725 --> 01:47:23,590
He said your entire
geography is bad.

1129
01:47:24,094 --> 01:47:26,756
Short and black-skinned,
squint-eyed,...

1130
01:47:26,930 --> 01:47:28,830
and that rotten buck-tooth!

1131
01:47:29,366 --> 01:47:32,392
As if the whole furniture were
kept outside the showroom.

1132
01:47:33,604 --> 01:47:35,162
Am l dark-skinned?
- That's what dad says.

1133
01:47:35,939 --> 01:47:38,464
Am l squint-eyed?
- Dad doesn't like that.

1134
01:47:47,117 --> 01:47:50,917
Now look here....
There's nothing to cry about.

1135
01:47:54,558 --> 01:47:57,425
l was only joking.
Dad has agreed!

1136
01:47:58,095 --> 01:47:59,460
You're lying.
- No, l'm not.

1137
01:47:59,763 --> 01:48:01,060
Swear it then.
- l swear by you.

1138
01:48:07,204 --> 01:48:12,506
lt was you who said all those
nasty things about me... didn't you?

1139
01:48:13,110 --> 01:48:16,876
ls the furniture really out?
- Not much. A little!

1140
01:48:22,352 --> 01:48:24,013
Why put the blame on your son.

1141
01:48:24,688 --> 01:48:27,782
Why don't you say that you don't
want a smuggler's daughter...

1142
01:48:28,425 --> 01:48:30,985
as daughter-in-law but want a girl
from a decent family instead.

1143
01:48:31,428 --> 01:48:34,226
You thought that you've
made a lot of money and...

1144
01:48:34,464 --> 01:48:36,591
by doing this you too
will become a decent man.

1145
01:48:39,503 --> 01:48:43,166
Nobody has ever dared to
speak to me like that.

1146
01:48:45,809 --> 01:48:49,540
l've never cheated anyone
nor have l tolerated it.

1147
01:48:49,746 --> 01:48:52,874
And you're calling me a cheat.

1148
01:48:56,386 --> 01:48:58,854
You know what consequences
you may face.

1149
01:49:00,724 --> 01:49:06,026
l got carried away. lt had to do
with my daughter's life.

1150
01:49:07,397 --> 01:49:08,523
l couldn't hold my tongue.

1151
01:49:16,440 --> 01:49:19,807
l had called you a friend once.

1152
01:49:21,545 --> 01:49:23,672
Which is why l'm forgiving you.

1153
01:49:24,648 --> 01:49:29,244
Anybody else in your place...
- l know. l'm ashamed of myself.

1154
01:49:35,058 --> 01:49:40,394
This is for the first time that
l couldn't fulfill my promise.

1155
01:49:44,101 --> 01:49:46,501
l wanted to have Pinky
as my daughter-in-law.

1156
01:49:48,739 --> 01:49:53,369
But l didn't know that my son
is in love with someone else.

1157
01:49:56,613 --> 01:50:01,073
Myy son is my weakness.

1158
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:08,880
l can't play with my son's life for
the sake of my business and promise.

1159
01:50:10,894 --> 01:50:12,191
No matter what happens.

1160
01:50:19,970 --> 01:50:22,336
How long will you wait?
Cut the cake fast.

1161
01:50:48,498 --> 01:50:51,990
What took you so long?
- l was held up somewhere.

1162
01:51:05,148 --> 01:51:10,484
''ln this youth that lasts
but for a few days...''

1163
01:51:12,189 --> 01:51:15,181
''ln this youth that lasts
but for a few days...''

1164
01:51:15,425 --> 01:51:18,155
''if you don't enjoy it...''

1165
01:51:20,597 --> 01:51:23,725
''what have you achieved in life?''

1166
01:51:24,134 --> 01:51:26,398
''What will you
have achieved?''

1167
01:51:27,104 --> 01:51:30,232
''What will you
have achieved?''

1168
01:51:43,753 --> 01:51:46,551
Color your life
with her tresses''

1169
01:51:46,923 --> 01:51:49,983
''Color your life...''

1170
01:51:53,797 --> 01:51:57,494
''Come into my arms...
l'm so passionate''

1171
01:51:57,767 --> 01:52:00,395
''Do come into my arms''

1172
01:52:03,607 --> 01:52:06,508
''What is life otherwise...''

1173
01:52:13,316 --> 01:52:16,717
''if you don't live it up''

1174
01:52:19,156 --> 01:52:21,886
''What will you
have achieved''

1175
01:52:54,658 --> 01:52:57,718
''What will you
have to show for''

1176
01:52:58,161 --> 01:52:59,287
''Life everybody leads...''

1177
01:52:59,462 --> 01:53:00,861
''but most kill their desires''

1178
01:53:01,698 --> 01:53:03,689
''Myost kill their desires''

1179
01:53:04,501 --> 01:53:07,402
''They were those who
could never fall in love...''

1180
01:53:07,637 --> 01:53:10,538
''for fear of the world''

1181
01:53:14,344 --> 01:53:19,008
''Why mustn't the world
let love be...''

1182
01:53:20,951 --> 01:53:26,514
''hasn't anyone ever
fallen in love earlier?''

1183
01:53:27,524 --> 01:53:29,048
''So what have they done?''

1184
01:53:32,729 --> 01:53:35,323
''What have they ever done''

1185
01:53:46,977 --> 01:53:48,410
You're always late.

1186
01:53:49,346 --> 01:53:51,314
This is Raju.
l told you about him.

1187
01:53:51,715 --> 01:53:54,240
How are you?
- Fine.

1188
01:53:55,552 --> 01:53:57,679
Your face bears a resemblance
to Dharamchand's.

1189
01:53:58,288 --> 01:53:59,346
Are you related to him?

1190
01:53:59,789 --> 01:54:01,120
Yes. l'm his son.

1191
01:54:03,760 --> 01:54:04,158
What happened?

1192
01:54:13,637 --> 01:54:14,296
You're my guest. l don't want to say
anything. But please go away from here.

1193
01:54:14,904 --> 01:54:17,429
What are you saying?
- l am saying the right thing.

1194
01:54:17,674 --> 01:54:22,373
What's matter?
- You won't be able to bear it.

1195
01:54:22,979 --> 01:54:26,540
You had better leave.
- l won't leave without knowing.

1196
01:54:27,183 --> 01:54:32,280
You're the son of a rich man.
But he has no respect.

1197
01:54:33,990 --> 01:54:35,014
ln the family you belong to...

1198
01:54:35,692 --> 01:54:40,493
daughters of smugglers
and traitors are married.

1199
01:54:41,398 --> 01:54:42,626
Not girls from respected families.

1200
01:54:44,734 --> 01:54:46,861
l would've killed you if you
were not Geeta's father.

1201
01:54:47,637 --> 01:54:49,605
What else can a
murderer's son do?

1202
01:54:49,973 --> 01:54:51,270
Who says that my father
is a murderer?

1203
01:54:51,508 --> 01:54:56,207
Ask anybody. Go and check the police
records. His name tops the list.

1204
01:54:56,646 --> 01:55:00,138
Ask your father as to how an illiterate
villager amassed so much of wealth.

1205
01:55:02,485 --> 01:55:09,323
l will. lf it's true then
l'll never come here.

1206
01:55:11,027 --> 01:55:17,262
And if it's not true then
l'll avenge this humiliation.

1207
01:55:21,438 --> 01:55:24,464
You should apologize to Raju.

1208
01:55:27,210 --> 01:55:29,144
You will never meet him again.

1209
01:55:39,289 --> 01:55:42,554
l want to ask you something.

1210
01:55:43,860 --> 01:55:44,724
Go on.

1211
01:55:45,662 --> 01:55:48,256
What is your business?

1212
01:55:58,842 --> 01:56:05,111
What makes you suddenly
ask me this question?

1213
01:56:06,383 --> 01:56:11,218
People say that you're
a smuggler and a murderer.

1214
01:56:11,554 --> 01:56:13,419
Your name tops the police list.

1215
01:56:15,258 --> 01:56:16,725
Who told you this?

1216
01:56:17,026 --> 01:56:18,857
Who told me is not important.

1217
01:56:19,295 --> 01:56:22,093
l want to know whether
this is right or wrong.

1218
01:56:24,367 --> 01:56:27,097
What do you think?
- Absolutely wrong.

1219
01:56:27,804 --> 01:56:33,299
Myy father cannot do such a thing.
But l want to hear it from you.

1220
01:56:34,310 --> 01:56:37,438
Just once. Swear by me and
say that this is wrong.

1221
01:56:38,114 --> 01:56:42,915
Swear by you? You're an educated man;
don't talk like an illiterate.

1222
01:56:43,453 --> 01:56:45,887
l know that it's worse than
being an illiterate...

1223
01:56:46,289 --> 01:56:48,757
but l know you
do love your son.

1224
01:56:49,993 --> 01:56:52,757
You'd never be able to take
a false oath on my head.

1225
01:56:53,763 --> 01:56:55,628
Place your hand
on my head.

1226
01:56:55,965 --> 01:56:58,798
After that, even if God tells me
that you're wrong, l won't believe Him.

1227
01:57:00,136 --> 01:57:01,603
Go ahead, dad.

1228
01:57:13,416 --> 01:57:15,680
l've asked you a question...

1229
01:57:21,458 --> 01:57:26,088
l have your answer, dad.
l know who you are.

1230
01:57:26,329 --> 01:57:32,427
l also know from where you have
got all this wealth. l understand.

1231
01:57:47,817 --> 01:57:50,183
What're you doing?
- l'm going away.

1232
01:57:50,687 --> 01:57:52,848
Where to?
- Anywhere.

1233
01:57:54,123 --> 01:57:55,715
But l'm leaving this house.

1234
01:57:56,493 --> 01:58:01,260
We pined for you for 20 years,
and waited for you all this time.

1235
01:58:02,232 --> 01:58:04,097
And you're leaving
as soon you come?

1236
01:58:05,034 --> 01:58:07,332
This is what you give
your parents for their love?

1237
01:58:07,804 --> 01:58:10,898
For a mother's love, certainly.
lt's priceless.

1238
01:58:11,841 --> 01:58:16,073
As far as father is concerned, he
loves his wealth more than you or me.

1239
01:58:18,348 --> 01:58:20,543
You've stayed out all your life.

1240
01:58:21,150 --> 01:58:24,119
ls this is what you conclude about your
father in the matter of a few days?

1241
01:58:25,154 --> 01:58:28,282
How would you know what he
has gone through in life.

1242
01:58:28,691 --> 01:58:34,789
l've spent my life with him. l've
been a witness to all his sufferings.

1243
01:58:38,301 --> 01:58:40,735
You speak about honesty
and self-respect.

1244
01:58:41,771 --> 01:58:46,799
There was a time when people used
to praise him for his honesty.

1245
01:58:47,577 --> 01:58:49,977
But later, they mocked
him for his honesty...

1246
01:58:50,346 --> 01:58:54,407
and called him an idiot
for being honest.

1247
01:58:54,617 --> 01:58:57,017
They blamed him and sent
him behind bars.

1248
01:58:57,320 --> 01:58:59,015
They sent him to prison...
so okay!

1249
01:58:59,188 --> 01:59:03,022
Does that mean he kills every
value that man must stand for?

1250
01:59:03,393 --> 01:59:04,758
Does that give him justification
to turn a smuggler and a criminal?

1251
01:59:05,028 --> 01:59:07,155
lt wasn't out of choice.
He was forced into it.

1252
01:59:07,830 --> 01:59:09,923
You wouldn't know.
You were a child then.

1253
01:59:10,433 --> 01:59:13,129
l used to do menial chores
to feed you.

1254
01:59:13,636 --> 01:59:15,797
l washed the utensils,
washed clothes for people.

1255
01:59:16,906 --> 01:59:21,741
l once fell down and your sister
died even before she could be born.

1256
01:59:23,212 --> 01:59:24,873
l lost my womb.

1257
01:59:25,582 --> 01:59:29,780
For a little amount of money,
someone raped his sister!

1258
01:59:31,120 --> 01:59:33,111
Having gone through
the trauma...

1259
01:59:33,256 --> 01:59:37,989
a man either kills himself or
decides to take revenge.

1260
01:59:41,598 --> 01:59:45,967
He would perhaps have committed
suicide if it wasn't for you and me.

1261
01:59:46,603 --> 01:59:50,437
But for our sake,
he lived like a corpse.

1262
01:59:51,641 --> 01:59:55,077
And if you still want to leave,
then go away.

1263
01:59:56,112 --> 01:59:59,081
l will understand that this is
what l am destined for.

1264
01:59:59,916 --> 02:00:05,081
The daughter, the sister and our
son too has left the house.

1265
02:00:05,822 --> 02:00:11,021
Myother, l...
l've made a mistake.

1266
02:00:13,596 --> 02:00:14,528
Please forgive me.

1267
02:00:25,008 --> 02:00:27,169
l've been waiting
for you for a long time.

1268
02:00:27,710 --> 02:00:29,041
Why have you called me?

1269
02:00:29,579 --> 02:00:31,479
What makes you think of the cops?

1270
02:00:32,281 --> 02:00:37,378
l come to meet you a friend;
not a police inspector.

1271
02:00:38,621 --> 02:00:40,987
Go ahead.

1272
02:00:48,598 --> 02:00:58,735
l've lost the battle l had waged
against life 20 years ago.

1273
02:01:00,843 --> 02:01:04,939
Varma has refused to marry
his daughter to my son.

1274
02:01:05,481 --> 02:01:06,914
This was bound to happen.

1275
02:01:07,817 --> 02:01:10,513
l've been trying to make
you see reason as a friend.

1276
02:01:11,387 --> 02:01:12,979
But you never listened to me.

1277
02:01:13,690 --> 02:01:15,954
You went on winning
and l went on losing.

1278
02:01:16,559 --> 02:01:19,653
The law wanted proof and you never
gave us the chance to get hold of it.

1279
02:01:20,196 --> 02:01:26,965
What else could l do? You know
l was an ordinary villager.

1280
02:01:28,438 --> 02:01:30,770
l came here to make
an honest living.

1281
02:01:32,208 --> 02:01:36,645
But those scoundrels took advantage
of naivete and ruined my life.

1282
02:01:37,380 --> 02:01:39,644
And you went on an avenging
spree after that.

1283
02:01:40,149 --> 02:01:41,810
You didn't wait for
the verdict of the law.

1284
02:01:42,185 --> 02:01:43,379
What else could l have done?

1285
02:01:44,854 --> 02:01:48,881
Let's suppose for a moment
that the law would punish them.

1286
02:01:49,025 --> 02:01:52,222
They would've hanged.
But what would l get?

1287
02:01:52,562 --> 02:01:54,553
Could that return my sister
and my daughter to me?

1288
02:01:55,131 --> 02:01:58,897
Did you get back your sister and
your daughter after what you did?

1289
02:02:00,503 --> 02:02:03,165
lf you want to live in this society,
you must learn to respect its laws.

1290
02:02:03,539 --> 02:02:05,837
You can't make your own set
of rules and live apart!

1291
02:02:06,909 --> 02:02:10,140
You signed those blank papers.
lt was your mistake.

1292
02:02:10,546 --> 02:02:12,480
lnstead of accepting your fault,
you blamed the law for it.

1293
02:02:12,849 --> 02:02:15,682
You revolted against it.
This is the result of your deeds.

1294
02:02:16,452 --> 02:02:19,979
What you sowed 20 years ago,
is what you are reaping now.

1295
02:02:25,428 --> 02:02:28,591
Do you know you have done to
yourself? You've ruined yourself.

1296
02:02:32,268 --> 02:02:35,135
Remember the Dharma who had come
from the village? He was so happy.

1297
02:02:35,505 --> 02:02:37,530
He used to make others laugh.

1298
02:02:38,574 --> 02:02:40,166
And look at this Dharma.

1299
02:02:40,610 --> 02:02:43,477
Whose happiness is buried
under a pile of wealth.

1300
02:02:43,980 --> 02:02:45,174
You're scared to speak.

1301
02:02:45,515 --> 02:02:47,983
Not you, not your wife and
not even your son is happy.

1302
02:02:49,152 --> 02:02:52,053
Dharma, l have tried to make you
understand this all my life.

1303
02:02:55,024 --> 02:02:59,427
You didn't understand anything
but people misunderstood me.

1304
02:03:00,029 --> 02:03:03,328
They thought l'm your stooge
and that l'm on your pay-roll.

1305
02:03:03,566 --> 02:03:05,966
They claimed it was the reason
why l had no evidence against you.

1306
02:03:06,469 --> 02:03:09,768
As a result, l stood
where l was.

1307
02:03:10,106 --> 02:03:12,700
All my junior officers
reached higher positions.

1308
02:03:13,543 --> 02:03:16,842
l remained where l was.

1309
02:03:21,217 --> 02:03:25,278
l'm indebted to you, Khan.

1310
02:03:27,256 --> 02:03:33,525
l'm indebted to my son, the law,
to society and to everyone.

1311
02:03:35,698 --> 02:03:40,965
When the time comes,
l'll repay your debt first.

1312
02:03:43,005 --> 02:03:45,997
But l need some time.

1313
02:03:47,109 --> 02:03:50,510
Let me marry off of my son.

1314
02:03:51,948 --> 02:03:57,887
Then l'll come to you personally
and surrender myself.

1315
02:04:02,024 --> 02:04:07,121
But remember one thing. lt took you
20 years to reach this decision.

1316
02:04:08,631 --> 02:04:12,533
lt would take another 20 years to
spend on the path of law.

1317
02:04:14,804 --> 02:04:16,669
l know that.

1318
02:04:17,340 --> 02:04:19,535
l don't like the way
this man is behaving.

1319
02:04:23,045 --> 02:04:26,208
Dharma runs the
business in your name.

1320
02:04:27,617 --> 02:04:29,551
You can land behind the bars.

1321
02:04:30,686 --> 02:04:33,382
There is still time.

1322
02:04:34,857 --> 02:04:38,623
But Myr. Singh, what can l do?

1323
02:04:44,200 --> 02:04:46,191
Myurder.

1324
02:04:47,103 --> 02:04:49,594
We don't have anyone who can...

1325
02:04:50,706 --> 02:04:55,473
Not here. But we do have someone
in Hong Kong. Call the boss.

1326
02:05:00,116 --> 02:05:05,611
Tell him that Dharamchand has
grown old. That he be given leave.

1327
02:05:10,626 --> 02:05:12,355
This is Geeta speaking.

1328
02:05:13,796 --> 02:05:14,728
What is it?

1329
02:05:15,364 --> 02:05:18,492
l've left the house.

1330
02:05:19,035 --> 02:05:22,766
What have you done?
Where're you calling from?

1331
02:05:24,206 --> 02:05:26,504
l'm coming.

1332
02:05:32,815 --> 02:05:36,080
Take me away from here.
Anywhere.

1333
02:05:37,219 --> 02:05:38,481
But where?

1334
02:05:41,724 --> 02:05:44,488
That's not possible.
- Why not?

1335
02:05:45,995 --> 02:05:48,555
Are you fed up of me
after coming here?

1336
02:05:48,764 --> 02:05:50,698
That's not the reason.

1337
02:05:59,442 --> 02:06:02,605
lf we elope, there will
be a lot of mud slinging.

1338
02:06:02,845 --> 02:06:05,473
Our parents won't be able
to face anyone.

1339
02:06:06,449 --> 02:06:07,916
And one more thing.

1340
02:06:08,784 --> 02:06:11,252
Myy mother has toiled
for me all her life.

1341
02:06:12,421 --> 02:06:14,651
She has done everything
to keep me happy.

1342
02:06:15,324 --> 02:06:17,019
l can't betray her.

1343
02:06:17,426 --> 02:06:21,658
What about me? l've left everything
and come for you. What about that?

1344
02:06:22,431 --> 02:06:24,922
That's a very big mistake
you've made, dear.

1345
02:06:25,768 --> 02:06:28,134
Raju, go away from here.

1346
02:06:33,576 --> 02:06:36,909
Do you know what mistake
you have committed, dear?

1347
02:06:37,947 --> 02:06:39,676
You've insulted womanhood.

1348
02:06:41,050 --> 02:06:43,280
Girls leave their home
only twice in a lifetime.

1349
02:06:44,220 --> 02:06:50,318
Once when she is married, and then
on the last journey to heaven.

1350
02:06:51,327 --> 02:06:53,386
That's the life of a woman.

1351
02:06:54,597 --> 02:06:57,395
She has no right to take
such decisions on her own.

1352
02:06:57,967 --> 02:07:01,562
That our parents are
adamant is okay, l suppose?

1353
02:07:01,804 --> 02:07:03,795
For their misplaced pride, they can
even ruin their children's lives!

1354
02:07:04,040 --> 02:07:05,735
Myust we bear all this silently?

1355
02:07:05,941 --> 02:07:07,636
Suffering in silence
is a woman's lot.

1356
02:07:12,715 --> 02:07:15,707
What has Raju got to do with
what his father has done?

1357
02:07:16,919 --> 02:07:20,719
What's his fault? Why should a son
pay for his father's crimes.

1358
02:07:21,957 --> 02:07:25,723
lt happens, dear.
lt happens sometimes.

1359
02:07:26,629 --> 02:07:28,893
Someone sometime commits a crime...

1360
02:07:29,165 --> 02:07:30,928
and someone else
has to pay for it.

1361
02:07:32,268 --> 02:07:34,361
l've spent an entire lifetime.

1362
02:07:35,404 --> 02:07:39,636
l didn't even get to realize
when l grew up and grew old.

1363
02:07:40,843 --> 02:07:43,209
Everything is ruined.

1364
02:07:45,981 --> 02:07:49,473
Forgive me, dear.
l went down memory lane.

1365
02:07:50,186 --> 02:07:54,088
Look dear. Never take any
wrong step in life.

1366
02:07:54,423 --> 02:07:56,721
Because you'll have to
repent it all your life.

1367
02:07:56,959 --> 02:07:58,017
What are you saying?

1368
02:07:58,627 --> 02:08:01,460
She wants to marry Raju in a court
and want to run away to London?

1369
02:08:02,064 --> 02:08:06,228
Yes. But l've made her see
reason. This is lndia, not London.

1370
02:08:06,969 --> 02:08:09,369
Out here, until and unless the
parents bless the couple...

1371
02:08:09,905 --> 02:08:11,873
the alliance is not considered
to be a real marriage.

1372
02:08:12,908 --> 02:08:16,275
She has accepted her mistake.
Now you too must forgive her.

1373
02:08:17,146 --> 02:08:21,708
l'm surprised to hear such
good words from Dharma's wife.

1374
02:08:23,119 --> 02:08:26,987
You'll be surprised to hear that
it has all been taught by him.

1375
02:08:30,693 --> 02:08:33,253
Let's not talk about that.

1376
02:09:19,074 --> 02:09:19,870
Yes?

1377
02:09:22,444 --> 02:09:28,383
l want to talk to you.

1378
02:09:32,154 --> 02:09:34,213
This way, please.

1379
02:09:38,127 --> 02:09:39,424
Yes?

1380
02:09:42,331 --> 02:09:47,030
l had been to your house and got
to know that you're here. So..

1381
02:09:50,839 --> 02:09:55,276
You may snatch away my son from me.

1382
02:09:58,214 --> 02:10:00,375
But please don't snatch
his happiness from him.

1383
02:10:00,583 --> 02:10:02,949
That's enough.
Please don't say anything more.

1384
02:10:03,586 --> 02:10:04,883
l've got to know of everything.

1385
02:10:06,121 --> 02:10:08,783
l am ashamed of myself.

1386
02:10:12,328 --> 02:10:16,560
l don't drink.
- Just a sip maybe?

1387
02:10:17,333 --> 02:10:20,928
l've drunk much in life, Myr. Varma.
But it was never alcohol.

1388
02:11:25,934 --> 02:11:30,394
Yesterday at Alibaug, a boat
arrived without any consignment.

1389
02:11:30,739 --> 02:11:32,798
But a man has arrived
on that boat.

1390
02:11:33,876 --> 02:11:35,707
Find out who the man is.

1391
02:11:38,147 --> 02:11:42,914
You didn't hide anything from me.
Who is this man who calls you?

1392
02:11:44,853 --> 02:11:47,378
l'll tell you before l die.

1393
02:11:58,100 --> 02:12:01,695
This is Ajit calling, Rajan.
l've come from Hong Kong.

1394
02:12:04,340 --> 02:12:07,503
You've lived off Dharma and in
the bargain forgotten me.

1395
02:12:08,344 --> 02:12:10,107
You're alive?

1396
02:12:10,946 --> 02:12:12,345
Yes. Abdullah saved me.

1397
02:12:13,282 --> 02:12:16,445
l'm putting up at the Taj.
Room No. 309.

1398
02:12:17,286 --> 02:12:18,981
Come and meet me immediately.

1399
02:12:19,188 --> 02:12:20,621
No. l can't meet you there.
- Why not?

1400
02:12:21,323 --> 02:12:25,419
Let's not speak over the phone.
l'll meet you at the Zoo at 4.

1401
02:13:02,431 --> 02:13:07,266
Did you find out about the man
who alighted at Alibaug beach?

1402
02:13:07,836 --> 02:13:11,135
l've told our men. But as of
now, there is no news.

1403
02:13:12,775 --> 02:13:15,073
He stayed at the Taj hotel.

1404
02:13:16,912 --> 02:13:20,143
Room No. 309.

1405
02:13:27,556 --> 02:13:32,050
What's up?
Why do you look so scared.

1406
02:13:34,730 --> 02:13:39,724
l think that man is
smarter than our men.

1407
02:13:43,005 --> 02:13:47,942
ln our business, people who are
not smart enough...

1408
02:13:50,112 --> 02:13:54,071
are likely to be caught any time.

1409
02:13:57,186 --> 02:13:58,915
Take care.

1410
02:13:59,755 --> 02:14:01,916
Sure. l'll leave now.

1411
02:14:21,577 --> 02:14:24,137
Why did you call me here?

1412
02:14:24,613 --> 02:14:28,606
Because Dharma has come to know
that you were staying at the Taj.

1413
02:14:33,422 --> 02:14:35,481
Have you chalked out a plan?

1414
02:14:36,258 --> 02:14:38,522
lt's not so easy
to finish Dharma.

1415
02:14:39,695 --> 02:14:41,822
He's always surrounded by his men.

1416
02:14:42,130 --> 02:14:45,099
You mean, he's never alone?

1417
02:14:47,903 --> 02:14:50,838
He is.
- When? Where?

1418
02:14:53,475 --> 02:14:59,607
ln the mornings. He takes a walk
all alone on the balcony.

1419
02:15:36,018 --> 02:15:38,009
Get the ambulance
and call Dr. Pereira.

1420
02:15:47,729 --> 02:15:50,163
l can't be saved now.

1421
02:15:55,003 --> 02:15:56,698
Nothing will happen to you!

1422
02:15:57,272 --> 02:15:59,900
lt's l who has committed those crimes.
How can you be punished for it?

1423
02:16:00,876 --> 02:16:02,002
You can't!

1424
02:16:03,145 --> 02:16:05,079
This isn't punishment.

1425
02:16:05,447 --> 02:16:09,645
lt's my good fortune...

1426
02:16:10,919 --> 02:16:15,822
that l breathe my last
in your arms.

1427
02:16:16,625 --> 02:16:20,356
Myother, what...
- Nothing's happened, son.

1428
02:16:22,064 --> 02:16:24,362
Surround the building.
That man was wearing a black jacket.

1429
02:16:27,603 --> 02:16:35,032
l leave Raju under your care.

1430
02:16:38,480 --> 02:16:39,970
No, Radha.
- Myother!

1431
02:16:40,182 --> 02:16:41,581
No, Radha...!

1432
02:16:43,352 --> 02:16:51,691
Don't leave me, Radha!
Please don't leave me!

1433
02:17:37,973 --> 02:17:39,133
Call Rajan.

1434
02:17:48,383 --> 02:17:50,317
lf You do exist...

1435
02:17:50,619 --> 02:17:54,214
You must prevent my son
from committing a murder.

1436
02:17:58,760 --> 02:18:01,024
l heard that sister-in-law...
- Nothing has happened.

1437
02:18:01,496 --> 02:18:02,861
Come with me.

1438
02:21:10,518 --> 02:21:13,248
Why did you stop here? We were
going to look for the killer.

1439
02:21:17,792 --> 02:21:19,487
The killer is right here.

1440
02:21:20,161 --> 02:21:21,492
ln front of me.

1441
02:21:26,234 --> 02:21:28,702
You didn't fire the bullet.

1442
02:21:29,905 --> 02:21:32,066
But behind the plan of her murder...

1443
02:21:34,776 --> 02:21:37,370
you too were involved.

1444
02:21:52,827 --> 02:21:54,260
No, son! Don't!

1445
02:21:57,565 --> 02:22:01,864
Stop, my son! l started this war
and l will end it.

1446
02:22:02,037 --> 02:22:05,529
No. This war has claimed
my mother's life!

1447
02:22:28,029 --> 02:22:30,896
Stop, Dharma. l said stop!
He can't escape!

1448
02:22:42,711 --> 02:22:44,144
No!

1449
02:22:46,481 --> 02:22:48,779
Don't touch me.

1450
02:22:49,050 --> 02:22:53,953
Don't come anywhere near me.
...l'm a sinner!

1451
02:22:56,291 --> 02:22:59,522
Keep away from even my shadow.

1452
02:22:59,728 --> 02:23:08,329
lt's full of fire.
lt could char your life.

1453
02:23:12,907 --> 02:23:20,336
l don't have much time, lnspector.

1454
02:23:22,183 --> 02:23:26,244
l want to repay your debt.

1455
02:23:26,488 --> 02:23:30,322
lf the burden is lesser,
my journey will be easier.

1456
02:23:31,659 --> 02:23:35,925
l can die in peace.

1457
02:23:36,464 --> 02:23:37,829
Myy son...

1458
02:23:38,033 --> 02:23:42,697
weather every sorrow
in your life, my son...

1459
02:23:43,004 --> 02:23:47,771
but that road to crime...
... never take it.

1460
02:23:48,009 --> 02:23:59,887
Sin is a spark that burns your
soul within. lt leaves you hollow.

1461
02:24:01,289 --> 02:24:04,486
Just as it has done to my soul.

1462
02:24:06,728 --> 02:24:14,294
l died a long time ago, son.
Long, long ago.

1463
02:24:15,770 --> 02:24:17,533
You don't know it...

1464
02:24:17,705 --> 02:24:19,502
the lnspector does.

1465
02:24:20,775 --> 02:24:31,913
lt's only my remains
that leave now.

1466
02:24:34,122 --> 02:24:38,354
lt's time...

1467
02:24:38,726 --> 02:24:40,717
lt's time, son.

1468
02:24:42,263 --> 02:24:43,230
Look...

1469
02:24:43,698 --> 02:24:47,031
Look, Radha has come for me!

1470
02:24:47,335 --> 02:24:48,461
Myy son...

1471
02:24:49,471 --> 02:24:51,029
Radha is here!

1472
02:24:51,539 --> 02:24:52,836
Radha is here!

1473
02:24:53,608 --> 02:24:56,270
Radha!
