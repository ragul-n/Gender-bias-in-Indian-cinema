1
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,210
"Oh, blue lotus (Neelathamara)."

2
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:20,625
"You have worn flowers."
"In my mind."

3
00:01:46,456 --> 00:01:49,323
"Oh, blue lotus."

4
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:58,628
"You have worn flowers."
"In my mind."

5
00:01:58,935 --> 00:02:01,904
"Oh, blue lotus."

6
00:02:02,105 --> 00:02:10,979
"You made waves..."
"...in the river."

7
00:02:11,481 --> 00:02:14,473
"You have worn the bunch
of peacock feathers..."

8
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:17,185
"...which I wished
to see that day."

9
00:02:17,654 --> 00:02:23,615
"One day, I became
wet in your tears."

10
00:02:23,827 --> 00:02:29,857
"Sun is far away from here.
Oh, beauty, wake up slowly."

11
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:38,633
"My eyes are twinkling to see you."

12
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:42,376
"Oh, blue lotus."

13
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:52,111
"You have worn flowers."
"In my mind."

14
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,278
"When I write a preface on you..."

15
00:03:20,483 --> 00:03:29,915
"I feel your beauty
when the wind arrives."

16
00:03:42,238 --> 00:03:54,116
"Your story made
my mind wet."

17
00:03:54,317 --> 00:04:00,313
"Sun is far away from here.
Oh, beauty, wake up slowly."

18
00:04:00,523 --> 00:04:09,625
"My eyes are
twinkling to see you."

19
00:04:25,214 --> 00:04:26,112
Okay.

20
00:04:27,784 --> 00:04:28,751
Very good.

21
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:30,408
Take this.
- Okay.

22
00:04:31,287 --> 00:04:31,878
Next.

23
00:04:31,988 --> 00:04:33,512
We also heard that.

24
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:37,288
Nowadays, no one keeps money
and so no flower blossoms.

25
00:04:37,493 --> 00:04:40,690
Actually, that is not lotus.
That is something else.

26
00:04:40,897 --> 00:04:44,094
The stem and root is still there now.
Sometimes flower would blossom.

27
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,868
That is not a big wonder.
- Cut it.

28
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,833
Most of the people believed in that.

29
00:04:49,072 --> 00:04:53,372
At first, your father also teased
by calling it a superstition.

30
00:04:53,576 --> 00:04:55,942
After that,
he too started believing.

31
00:04:56,512 --> 00:05:00,573
If some wonders occur in our area,
no one will believe it.

32
00:05:00,783 --> 00:05:05,083
An outsider should come and tell.
That is people's mentality.

33
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:09,420
Why didn't you tell me early that
I can be seen like this in the laptop?

34
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:16,155
Then I would have dressed well.

35
00:05:16,366 --> 00:05:18,926
Grandmother, you are looking
beautiful in this dress too.

36
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,568
How are you?

37
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,805
Getting well.
Now, I can walk a little.

38
00:05:33,016 --> 00:05:34,984
We were going to hospital
to see you.

39
00:05:35,184 --> 00:05:37,049
Then we came to know that
you are at home now.

40
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:40,984
Going to see patients in hospital
is one of the customs here.

41
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:44,557
But if it is at the house,
they won't come.

42
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:52,167
Like going to temple, they will go
to see patients in hospital.

43
00:05:53,202 --> 00:05:54,362
I will come tomorrow.

44
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:57,300
Now, the bridge is completed and
the car will come till the yard.

45
00:05:57,507 --> 00:06:00,169
Then why are you staying in TB?

46
00:06:00,376 --> 00:06:01,809
Other people are there too.

47
00:06:03,579 --> 00:06:04,341
You know her?
- No.

48
00:06:04,547 --> 00:06:06,071
Daughter of Haridasan.

49
00:06:06,315 --> 00:06:08,374
She is working in television.

50
00:06:08,584 --> 00:06:12,884
I would watch all the serials.
But I didn't see you ever.

51
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:14,918
That may not be seen here.

52
00:06:15,158 --> 00:06:16,147
Are you coming tomorrow?

53
00:06:18,661 --> 00:06:21,425
My fiancee wants to see you,
Grandmother.

54
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:22,995
Yours?

55
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:24,591
Yes.

56
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:26,492
Come here.

57
00:06:30,273 --> 00:06:32,104
Does he know Malayalam?

58
00:06:32,341 --> 00:06:33,831
First, you see him, Maluty Amma.

59
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:42,607
"Squirrel, come and
make friendship with me."

60
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:48,621
"Squirrel, come and
make friendship with me."

61
00:07:03,806 --> 00:07:05,899
I heard you have come
to this place.

62
00:07:06,876 --> 00:07:09,401
My unit too is with me.
We are staying in a guest-house.

63
00:07:09,612 --> 00:07:12,945
The old lady Kaali's daughter
Paru is there for mother's help.

64
00:07:13,149 --> 00:07:16,949
She wants to go. Just now,
I arranged one home nurse.

65
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:24,089
Anyway, I see you two together now.
So, I want to tell you something. - What?

66
00:07:24,894 --> 00:07:28,591
My two sons are working abroad.
Not bad.

67
00:07:28,831 --> 00:07:31,459
The existing house was renovated
and a new house was built.

68
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:33,601
I heard all that, Achuthan Nair.

69
00:07:33,936 --> 00:07:34,994
You wait for a second.

70
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:37,069
You too have to hear that.

71
00:07:37,607 --> 00:07:39,438
I have been here since
my childhood.

72
00:07:39,642 --> 00:07:42,338
Your Maluty Amma didn't
see me like a caretaker.

73
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:43,508
I know.

74
00:07:43,846 --> 00:07:47,213
Lots of people have an eye on
this house and the property.

75
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:49,941
Now, everybody who is in
this village have money.

76
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,781
Don't sell it to an outsider.

77
00:07:53,756 --> 00:07:56,953
My children are ready to buy this.

78
00:07:57,293 --> 00:07:59,227
That is only after mother's death.

79
00:07:59,428 --> 00:08:02,261
After that, she has the right
to that and not me.

80
00:08:02,465 --> 00:08:05,730
Oh. He got married again.

81
00:08:05,935 --> 00:08:08,233
Yes. There's a rule.
- That's new for me.

82
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:12,405
No one shows rush for that.
Grandmother will live long.

83
00:08:12,608 --> 00:08:13,973
Now, she is only 80.

84
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,317
After you leave, I'm thinking
that who will be here.

85
00:08:28,624 --> 00:08:30,319
Kunjukutty would be there
in the kitchen.

86
00:08:30,526 --> 00:08:31,891
I have to go.

87
00:08:32,161 --> 00:08:35,221
Daughter's delivery date is near.
She is alone there.

88
00:08:35,665 --> 00:08:39,601
Till she delivers a child,
you will have to be there. - Yes.

89
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,200
You don't worry about me.

90
00:08:42,872 --> 00:08:45,136
Ratnam, what all are
your programmes?

91
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,141
Children are alone in Bangalore.

92
00:08:48,811 --> 00:08:51,041
My husband has gone for
a course to Shimla.

93
00:08:51,714 --> 00:08:53,579
Why didn't you bring your children?

94
00:08:54,517 --> 00:08:57,953
You are not a stranger to me.

95
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:03,017
When will that nurse come?

96
00:09:06,162 --> 00:09:07,857
God is calling back the
youngsters early.

97
00:09:08,097 --> 00:09:15,594
Those who are burden to others are still here.
These all are God's plays.

98
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,633
Did you recognise me?

99
00:09:49,605 --> 00:09:51,903
Kunjimalu is still looking young.

100
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,836
If I say, anyone would believe.

101
00:09:55,611 --> 00:09:58,079
Yesterday too, I dreamt of her.

102
00:10:03,319 --> 00:10:04,752
I also had doubt.

103
00:10:05,221 --> 00:10:06,654
I am seeing you after a long time.

104
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,483
I recognise you.

105
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:15,258
Hello.

106
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:17,324
If needed, I will call you.

107
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,002
No. Not anymore.

108
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,670
Okay.

109
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:28,935
My daughter told me that you came
from hospital slightly cured.

110
00:10:29,145 --> 00:10:30,510
Now, she called me.

111
00:10:31,647 --> 00:10:34,775
She came two times along
with Dr. Kurien.

112
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,946
That slim girl with spectacles.

113
00:10:37,186 --> 00:10:39,950
Yes. Is that your daughter?

114
00:10:40,956 --> 00:10:43,117
She cared for me specially.

115
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:48,628
Then why didn't she tell me
she is Kunjimalu's daughter?

116
00:10:48,831 --> 00:10:51,129
She is a lady doctor.
I didn't know that.

117
00:10:51,334 --> 00:10:54,462
She knows.
About my stay here.

118
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,160
Her behavior is good.

119
00:10:56,972 --> 00:10:59,270
Whenever she takes injection
she will tell me to close...

120
00:10:59,475 --> 00:11:03,969
...the eyes and there would
be just a little pain.

121
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:06,805
Kunjimalu's daughter.

122
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:11,850
I would enquire about you.
I heard that you have two daughters.

123
00:11:12,054 --> 00:11:12,952
What does the younger one do?

124
00:11:13,155 --> 00:11:16,852
She has completed her B. Ed. Now,
she is a teacher. Near to our house.

125
00:11:17,059 --> 00:11:21,826
It is happy to hear that
everybody is keeping well.

126
00:11:22,832 --> 00:11:26,063
What about Appukuttan?
His name is Appukuttan, right?

127
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:29,829
You didn't forget, right?
Doing business. It is going well.

128
00:11:31,407 --> 00:11:32,669
I will call you later.

129
00:11:40,983 --> 00:11:44,077
Do you remember that Master
who sat under this banyan tree?

130
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,148
Don't remember well.

131
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,227
Raghavan?

132
00:12:04,173 --> 00:12:06,073
Are you going inside to pray?
- No.

133
00:12:06,275 --> 00:12:07,606
Kunjimalu, you go and come.

134
00:12:22,525 --> 00:12:24,459
Kalyani, I am going.

135
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,130
I didn't recognise you.

136
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,333
I am from Kizhakkampattu.

137
00:12:34,537 --> 00:12:36,232
Malukutty Amma's daughter-in-law.

138
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:39,306
Daughter of Balan Menon, right?
- Yes.

139
00:12:39,608 --> 00:12:43,738
After Dasan's death,
you got married again, right?

140
00:12:43,946 --> 00:12:45,072
I heard that.

141
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:48,414
In that marriage,
how many children you have? - Two.

142
00:12:48,784 --> 00:12:50,251
What is he doing?

143
00:12:51,954 --> 00:12:52,750
Let's go.

144
00:12:53,789 --> 00:12:54,483
Okay.

145
00:12:57,126 --> 00:12:58,559
What all does he want to know?

146
00:12:58,794 --> 00:13:00,455
He is Pandit master of
Sharath house.

147
00:13:00,996 --> 00:13:03,260
Did you remember
Ammini of Sharath house?

148
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:06,931
Most of the things, I don't remember.
I was here only for short time.

149
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:10,200
"You go see Devi and
come back."

150
00:13:10,406 --> 00:13:13,170
"I will go and kill Ravanan."

151
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:17,937
"Nothing will happen to you."

152
00:13:18,147 --> 00:13:26,782
"Let auspicious things happen."

153
00:13:28,023 --> 00:13:32,153
Eyes are okay.
But I can't read more now.

154
00:13:37,967 --> 00:13:40,299
There is no difficulty for
the first phase of sleep.

155
00:13:41,337 --> 00:13:46,365
Once I am awake, I have to be
in bed sleepless till morning.

156
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:47,701
Oh. My God.

157
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,971
You sleep on the top.
- Yes.

158
00:13:52,181 --> 00:13:55,582
You also sleep.
You have to go in the morning, know?

159
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,190
Oh, Lord Krishna.

160
00:14:26,248 --> 00:14:27,738
All these are done by Beena.

161
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,781
After searching, she kept it like this.

162
00:14:30,686 --> 00:14:33,280
Her father wrote stories and poems.

163
00:14:33,489 --> 00:14:34,717
She may search for that.

164
00:14:34,924 --> 00:14:35,982
Has she got anything?

165
00:14:36,191 --> 00:14:38,284
Where has she got time
for speaking?

166
00:14:38,494 --> 00:14:41,122
She doesn't call.
And doesn't send reply to my letter.

167
00:14:43,866 --> 00:14:45,265
I heard he had died.

168
00:14:45,734 --> 00:14:46,996
What was his sickness?

169
00:14:47,202 --> 00:14:49,568
He always mentioned
he had headache.

170
00:14:50,072 --> 00:14:53,439
When diagnosed, it was brain tumor.
It didn't cure with treatment.

171
00:14:54,076 --> 00:14:55,168
Now, you...

172
00:14:55,744 --> 00:14:58,838
Its good luck that
a nice man came again.

173
00:14:59,381 --> 00:15:03,283
Most of the people think about
my re-marriage as an offence.

174
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:04,611
Beena too.

175
00:15:06,555 --> 00:15:09,956
This mother never has
any complaint on that.

176
00:15:45,728 --> 00:15:47,320
He took my photo.

177
00:15:47,563 --> 00:15:49,497
But I didn't see.

178
00:15:49,898 --> 00:15:50,990
Keep this.

179
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,760
Your children can see how
you were in your youth.

180
00:15:54,303 --> 00:15:56,464
Should I keep?
- Keep it.

181
00:15:57,139 --> 00:16:01,599
Old memories are the best
asset to be kept in old age.

182
00:16:19,762 --> 00:16:24,290
You may curse me a lot for
grabbing your dreams.

183
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:30,630
I cursed myself.
For my foolishness.

184
00:16:34,343 --> 00:16:36,208
I am sleeping in the next room.
You sleep here.

185
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,107
No. I will sleep down.

186
00:16:38,313 --> 00:16:40,247
No. I am sleeping there.

187
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,894
It will be slightly cold
in the morning.

188
00:18:01,463 --> 00:18:05,763
Those days at night, the singer had sung,
now, also someone is singing.

189
00:18:05,968 --> 00:18:07,367
Now, who is there to sing?

190
00:18:13,142 --> 00:18:14,336
Not sleeping?

191
00:18:14,643 --> 00:18:15,405
After sometime.

192
00:18:15,944 --> 00:18:17,377
I forgot to tell you something.

193
00:18:17,946 --> 00:18:20,141
There is one letter in my cupboard.

194
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:22,176
My ex-husband had written
it for you.

195
00:18:23,051 --> 00:18:25,246
Four days before death.

196
00:18:26,054 --> 00:18:28,545
He put that letter in envelope
and wrote the address.

197
00:18:28,757 --> 00:18:34,218
Then said, "Don't send."
He told me to tear it off.

198
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,293
I didn't tear it.

199
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,129
I never knew that
I will meet you here.

200
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,131
I will send that letter to you.

201
00:18:41,336 --> 00:18:43,930
No.
- He wrote that letter for you.

202
00:18:44,606 --> 00:18:45,698
I didn't read that.

203
00:18:46,575 --> 00:18:47,940
I didn't feel like.

204
00:18:50,913 --> 00:18:53,746
I don't want it.
I don't want to read it.

205
00:18:58,453 --> 00:19:01,013
He remembered me once
and wrote something.

206
00:19:03,192 --> 00:19:06,127
I am happy to hear that.

207
00:19:23,011 --> 00:19:26,139
"What is life?"

208
00:19:26,348 --> 00:19:29,579
"What is happiness?"

209
00:19:29,785 --> 00:19:33,312
"What is life?"

210
00:19:33,522 --> 00:19:36,355
"What is happiness?"

211
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:43,293
"Only God knows."

212
00:19:43,498 --> 00:19:47,093
"What is life?"

213
00:19:47,302 --> 00:19:50,465
"What is happiness?"

214
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:27,441
Where are you going?
- Going to Kizhakkumpattu.

215
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:29,671
Come.

216
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,111
This is why I told not to come.

217
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:39,783
Be careful.

218
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,981
It is going to rain.
Please come on the porch.

219
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:18,157
I am not well. I can't walk.

220
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:25,833
Please sit.

221
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:28,832
Maithan told us one girl is
needed here. - Yes.

222
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:31,335
The caretaker of here has
told Maithan about that.

223
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,940
No one is there to help me in
the kitchen since the last few days.

224
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,435
You know to cook?
- A little bit.

225
00:21:36,645 --> 00:21:39,739
We are Vellapillai.
This is my granddaughter.

226
00:21:39,948 --> 00:21:41,939
She has four young siblings.

227
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:45,179
After her mother's death,
our situation has been worse.

228
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:49,353
Who is he?
- My grandson.

229
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:53,190
He ran away from the house five years
back and has returned now.

230
00:21:53,528 --> 00:21:56,361
He doesn't help me in my work.
He knows making bread.

231
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:57,691
He will go for that work.

232
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,863
Now, who wants us to
wash their clothes?

233
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,867
Soap and iron box are
there in all houses.

234
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,800
Then also some houses
are still available.

235
00:22:05,173 --> 00:22:07,198
If we do that work,
what will we get?

236
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,373
Only two drums of rice during
Onam and Vishu (festivals).

237
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,205
They don't give us money.
- Appukuttan.

238
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,715
I am alone here.

239
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,811
I will do most of the cooking myself.
There is somebody for outside work.

240
00:22:19,021 --> 00:22:21,114
I need a person to help me.

241
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:23,717
Give me some water.

242
00:22:27,162 --> 00:22:29,392
How much did Maithan
tell you as salary?

243
00:22:29,865 --> 00:22:34,234
This is a reputed family.
They will do as per what's necessary.

244
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:37,731
This house. Oh! Sweeping
itself would be a big job.

245
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:41,075
This old woman told you and you came.
You should tolerate everything.

246
00:22:42,844 --> 00:22:45,574
That would be at least for
my medicine and oil.

247
00:22:53,655 --> 00:22:54,587
This is buttermilk.

248
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:59,023
Whenever my son comes in the evening
I make some snacks.

249
00:22:59,227 --> 00:23:06,099
He is studying in Ernakulam.
You stay here and go tomorrow.

250
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:09,202
No. I will come later.

251
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,701
She doesn't have any experience.
- No problem.

252
00:23:16,244 --> 00:23:19,941
Caretaker will come and give
her every month's salary.

253
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:22,283
You can come here occasionally.

254
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,619
You know what I told you.

255
00:23:29,257 --> 00:23:31,054
Appukuttan, let's go.
- Yes.

256
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,127
Buttermilk.

257
00:23:52,247 --> 00:23:54,306
What is your name?
- Kunjimalu.

258
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:56,411
Same name of mine.

259
00:23:56,618 --> 00:23:59,644
In my childhood,
everybody called me Maluty.

260
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,825
I haven't received the full
amount for the coconuts.

261
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:08,155
Last month's balance is also there.
- He will give. He is a miser.

262
00:24:08,897 --> 00:24:11,661
What about the estate?
- I already told three people.

263
00:24:14,002 --> 00:24:15,993
The Arecanut's money is
also pending.

264
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:18,331
I know. I have already told him.

265
00:24:19,975 --> 00:24:22,500
I need Rs.15

266
00:24:23,145 --> 00:24:25,170
Why didn't you take from this?

267
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,905
I want the accounts to
always be proper.

268
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:40,356
Holy lamp. Holy lamp.
Holy lamp. Holy lamp.

269
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:58,637
Maithan has sent her.

270
00:24:58,847 --> 00:25:00,371
She is a Vellapillai girl from
the other side of the river.

271
00:25:00,715 --> 00:25:01,807
Small girl.

272
00:25:02,317 --> 00:25:04,808
Why didn't you keep someone
who is little aged?

273
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,954
She said she knows
household work a little bit.

274
00:25:07,355 --> 00:25:09,220
I also need someone
in my house.

275
00:25:09,491 --> 00:25:11,118
Narayani is not well.

276
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:13,884
She is not able to do any work.

277
00:25:14,696 --> 00:25:16,493
May I go.
- Yes.

278
00:25:37,219 --> 00:25:39,084
There is one more bed underneath.
- Yes.

279
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,845
You sleep on the floor.
- Yes.

280
00:25:48,363 --> 00:25:51,594
Are your younger siblings studying?
- Yes. Two of them.

281
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,926
One in the second standard
and the other in fifth.

282
00:25:53,235 --> 00:25:55,760
Your father won't give you anything?
- That time, he had given.

283
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,269
After his second marriage,
he didn't give anything.

284
00:25:58,473 --> 00:25:59,940
He has two children from that too.

285
00:26:00,909 --> 00:26:04,345
If it is man or woman,
fate should be good.

286
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:36,109
"Hey, Lord Krishna."

287
00:26:36,244 --> 00:26:40,078
This singer always sings like this
if he suffers from a lot of pain.

288
00:26:40,282 --> 00:26:42,807
He has been lying due to
paralysis since two years.

289
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:43,814
Poor man.

290
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:46,144
But now too,
his voice is still strong.

291
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:50,986
Kunjimalu, would you get
up in the morning? - Yes.

292
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:27,194
I didn't see you before.
- I'm from Kizhakkampattu.

293
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:29,693
Yes. I heard that someone
had come there to stay.

294
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,126
I am Ammini of Sharath House.

295
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:39,798
Oh! Today, the flower
has blossomed.

296
00:27:40,141 --> 00:27:41,540
Yes. Someone has kept
money yesterday.

297
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:45,042
Priest Vaidyamadom came yesterday.
He may have kept money on the steps.

298
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,214
Have you heard about this
flower's specialty? - No.

299
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:53,046
This flower is needed for some
veneration in the temple.

300
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:55,381
People will come from
a lot of places.

301
00:27:55,957 --> 00:27:58,221
They will keep money
to fulfill their wishes.

302
00:27:59,527 --> 00:28:01,688
If we keep money for testing,
then flower won't blossom.

303
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,725
Who are we to test God?

304
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,400
Ammini, did your sister-in-law come?
- No. She will come this week.

305
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,326
Has Haridasan come?
- Who?

306
00:28:08,536 --> 00:28:10,731
Maluty Amma's son.
- No.

307
00:28:22,984 --> 00:28:24,747
Take bath fast,
otherwise it will be crowded.

308
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,095
Master, did you have tea.

309
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:36,354
I not only had tea,
but breakfast too.

310
00:28:36,564 --> 00:28:39,431
Restaurant owner Nanu
gave it free to me.

311
00:28:40,535 --> 00:28:44,665
Master, you started smoking?
- Everything is just a smoke.

312
00:28:45,073 --> 00:28:47,598
Smoke and screen
is smokescreen.

313
00:28:47,876 --> 00:28:50,606
This is the gift of Velu.

314
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:54,440
Ammini, donors are
increasing day by day.

315
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:56,944
This is master who always
sits under the banyan tree.

316
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,780
He studied music from
Thanjavoor and Kumbhakonam.

317
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:02,286
But he is little mad.
- Doesn't he have a family?

318
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,957
No. He is alone...

319
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,387
Stop. Stop.

320
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:12,129
Is this girl from Kizhakkumpattu?
- Yes.

321
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,467
Good.

322
00:29:14,035 --> 00:29:18,404
Here, someone's mind is to
be washed and cleaned.

323
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:22,302
For that, some more
soda powder is needed.

324
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:32,416
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

325
00:29:32,787 --> 00:29:33,981
I forgot to ask you.

326
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,157
Did you bring sufficient dresses?
- Yes.

327
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,325
What do you want as breakfast?

328
00:29:41,763 --> 00:29:43,822
Semolina is there.
I will make upma (food item).

329
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:48,833
No. We both are here.
You make lunch early.

330
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,672
When Haridasan comes,
he needs breakfast in the morning.

331
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,505
He needs something to eat
in the evening too.

332
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,245
Flower has blossomed
in the temple pond.

333
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:05,508
Someone may have prayed.
Outsiders believe in that a lot.

334
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:07,847
What curry is to be made?

335
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:12,853
Pluck banana from the estate.
Okra and peas are near the well.

336
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,460
Pluck some from there.
Make dry dish with banana and peas.

337
00:30:14,662 --> 00:30:16,857
With okra, you make curry.
That's enough.

338
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:30,377
Kaali. Kaali.

339
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,881
What happened?
- I was calling to give her food.

340
00:30:34,182 --> 00:30:37,049
Look, after he comes,
don't make any noise.

341
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:41,047
He doesn't like that.
He got his father's character.

342
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:43,617
But nothing inside.

343
00:30:44,225 --> 00:30:46,887
His exams are over.
When is he coming?

344
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,556
Oh! You came?

345
00:30:53,868 --> 00:30:56,496
Come. Come. Come.

346
00:31:07,515 --> 00:31:09,005
Slowly.

347
00:31:10,018 --> 00:31:15,183
Someone is coming here.
Then don't make noise.

348
00:31:21,896 --> 00:31:23,090
Stand properly.

349
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,334
It is you.

350
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,886
Stars of the day.

351
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:35,892
C.P. Haridasan.

352
00:33:37,699 --> 00:33:39,223
C.P. Haridasan.

353
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:45,997
Be careful. Are you on the way?
- Yes.

354
00:34:00,855 --> 00:34:03,016
Your studies over?
- Yes.

355
00:34:15,903 --> 00:34:18,929
I heard that the work on the bridge
at Vellankallil would start soon.

356
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,370
Is it?
- Then we can make road till our house.

357
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:23,375
All the fields belong to us.

358
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:27,342
If the boat is not there,
what would Beeran do?

359
00:34:27,915 --> 00:34:32,784
They said about the bridge during election.
Chances of coming are less.

360
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:45,297
I thought you came after going
to uncle Balan's house.

361
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,968
I wrote a letter to him.
I will go afterwards. - Okay.

362
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,541
Kunjimalu.
- Yes?

363
00:34:57,111 --> 00:34:59,636
I will tell you what to make.
- Yes.

364
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:01,314
Is Meenakshi Amma not
there in kitchen?

365
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:04,144
I send her back.
Sometimes she would steal something.

366
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:05,979
How many times
should I forgive her?

367
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:11,817
Put your clothes under the staircase.
She will wash. - Okay.

368
00:35:18,633 --> 00:35:20,157
Make curry with lentils and
leaves of drum-stick.

369
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:23,166
Using banana, make a dry dish.
Make dry chilly fry too.

370
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,998
He doesn't want a lot of dishes.

371
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:28,671
Do you know how to make fish curry?
- Yes.

372
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,609
Not for today.

373
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:35,073
Kunjan may bring river fish for him.

374
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:39,182
After you finish your work,
wash his clothes.

375
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,014
Achuthan will take and
get it ironed from the market.

376
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:44,680
If iron box is here, then I'll do.
- He doesn't like that.

377
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:47,687
I am going.

378
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:50,523
Why are you in such a hurry?
He is here. Go after lunch.

379
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:54,861
I'll come later. I'm having some
work with the document writer. - Okay.

380
00:36:11,319 --> 00:36:14,550
Kunjimalu, what are today's dishes?
Special for the advocate.

381
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,552
Pumpkin and other vegetables
are there in the garden.

382
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,054
He doesn't like that.

383
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:20,556
This is from the temple.
My sister's offering.

384
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,558
She came?
- Yes.

385
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:26,563
Problem has started.
Both children are naughty.

386
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:29,736
If they break the house, then also
brother-in-law won't say anything.

387
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:33,069
Sister-in-law will always find a fault
in whatever we make and give.

388
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,298
That is the problem.

389
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:39,906
My brother got three months leave.
My brother eats everything.

390
00:36:43,217 --> 00:36:45,515
In the morning, there was veneration
in the temple by my sister-in-law.

391
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,418
One day, you go and bring one
pudding (Kheer) from the temple.

392
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,647
Dasan likes that very much.

393
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:53,916
Till your sister-in-law and children leave...
...you have lot of work at home, right?

394
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,928
Now, you are 22, right, Ammini?
- Yes

395
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:00,862
I always thought of asking your
mother about your marriage?

396
00:37:01,068 --> 00:37:03,263
Has any proposal come?

397
00:37:04,071 --> 00:37:06,437
Whatever uncle likes,
that horoscope won't match.

398
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,871
Uncle won't like the proposal
which matches horoscope.

399
00:37:09,911 --> 00:37:16,544
There is Mangal (planet)
in my horoscope.

400
00:37:16,851 --> 00:37:18,785
What can I do, Maluty Amma?

401
00:37:22,924 --> 00:37:25,290
What does your uncle say
about your job?

402
00:37:25,726 --> 00:37:29,787
Uncle Balan already has eight-nine juniors.
He is planning to take me too.

403
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:32,966
So what? Your uncle is
a reputed advocate.

404
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,465
I told uncle that I don't want
the job of advocate.

405
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:39,806
First, result should come.
- You are tensed after your exams.

406
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:42,635
This time around, I am scared.
I didn't write one exam well.

407
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,411
Not only me, but everybody.

408
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:18,336
"Praising the Lord."
"Praising the Lord."

409
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,605
You smoke a lot these days.
- No. No.

410
00:38:20,982 --> 00:38:22,677
Only once in a while.
- Okay.

411
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:28,685
After the singer was paralysed, the people
here had taken interest in music, right?

412
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:32,424
Sometimes he is silent and
sometimes he sings.

413
00:38:32,626 --> 00:38:41,466
I will tell all my friends about master & singer.
Veladuyan Master is not there, right?

414
00:38:41,669 --> 00:38:42,863
You father always said...

415
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:46,198
...that the glory of this temple won't
be anywhere in the world.

416
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,132
God here is very good.

417
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:52,436
The story is that he comes in the morning
after going to meet three women.

418
00:38:52,646 --> 00:38:54,978
Don't say nonsense.
Go and sleep.

419
00:38:55,649 --> 00:38:57,048
You came after travelling.

420
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,215
That girl didn't keep water
for drinking.

421
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:03,215
Kunjimalu. Keep one tumbler
full of warm water...

422
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:06,484
...and in a clay pot,
take normal water too.

423
00:39:40,661 --> 00:39:41,923
Give me a glass of water.

424
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,784
Don't run. Stop.

425
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:11,781
Don't show naughtiness.
- I didn't see you in the temple pond.

426
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:12,856
I am menstruating.

427
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:16,023
Haridasan is not there?
- Yes.

428
00:40:16,564 --> 00:40:18,623
He is always reading in his room.

429
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:21,297
Hi!

430
00:40:22,103 --> 00:40:25,072
It is rolled gold.
But looks like gold. - Yes.

431
00:40:25,272 --> 00:40:27,638
My brother brought it from Coimbatore.
- Is it?

432
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,644
We want to see the lamps
in the Cherangara temple.

433
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:33,973
Children want to see that.
Brother told me to come.

434
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:36,308
Are you coming?
- No.

435
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,815
I will take permission from Maluty Amma.
- No. no.

436
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,648
I want to give milk
At Emranthiri's house. Thrice a day.

437
00:40:45,793 --> 00:40:46,657
Look here.

438
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:48,992
Like that.

439
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,998
Okay. Now, look here.

440
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:55,665
Smile.

441
00:41:13,654 --> 00:41:14,848
Please stand there.

442
00:41:15,322 --> 00:41:16,346
Catch that pot.

443
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:20,193
Like that.

444
00:41:20,494 --> 00:41:21,461
Keep the other hand.

445
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:24,125
Smile.

446
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:29,031
Very good.
Catch that branch.

447
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:31,701
Like that.

448
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:34,370
Smile.

449
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:36,368
Smile nicely.

450
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,137
Stand there.

451
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,048
Stand a bit closer.

452
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,052
Look here.

453
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:00,396
Did anything happen?

454
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:03,835
Nothing happened to the camera.

455
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:42,036
Don't want it too hot.

456
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:57,958
Too hot.

457
00:43:07,735 --> 00:43:09,293
Your hand also got hurt, right?

458
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:10,568
No problem.

459
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:16,237
Enough.

460
00:43:17,111 --> 00:43:19,306
Camphor powder is there
in the bathroom.

461
00:43:19,613 --> 00:43:23,640
While bathing, put that also.
Take bath in hot water.

462
00:43:23,884 --> 00:43:26,910
If needed, I will keep hot water
in the bathroom upstairs.

463
00:43:27,121 --> 00:43:33,492
There is nothing to worry about it.
Go do your work.

464
00:43:43,337 --> 00:44:01,052
"The song you pine for..."
"I have found that song for you."

465
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:03,519
Is it paining?
Swelling is not there.

466
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:07,023
I want this to go slowly.
I like your hot massage.

467
00:44:08,162 --> 00:44:09,129
Have you done your studies?

468
00:44:09,663 --> 00:44:11,528
I studied only up to eighth grade.

469
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:14,962
Do you have jacket and half sari?

470
00:44:15,336 --> 00:44:16,530
Yes. I got one pair.

471
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,873
I can take better photos.
Film is there.

472
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:23,539
Look here.

473
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:26,045
If mother has slept,
then come upstairs.

474
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:28,711
You don't worry.
I want to ask something to you.

475
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:29,382
Come up.

476
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:32,878
Hey!
- Yes!

477
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,550
Look! Be careful while
climbing the staircase.

478
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:37,314
The third step will make some sound.

479
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:55,500
"Always live happily."
"Always live happily."

480
00:45:55,669 --> 00:46:18,014
"Oh, God, give us happiness."
"Always live happily."

481
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:24,254
Good morning.

482
00:46:26,266 --> 00:46:27,494
I thought you will come.

483
00:46:39,947 --> 00:46:42,006
I don't have time even to bathe.

484
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,343
Early morning itself children
need breakfast.

485
00:46:45,953 --> 00:46:49,116
If I have Rs.1, then I would
keep on the step and pray.

486
00:46:49,623 --> 00:46:52,251
What is special to know about?
- Something is there.

487
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,019
Don't test God.

488
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:56,191
This is not for testing God.

489
00:46:56,396 --> 00:47:00,799
I want to know something urgently.
- Is it a secret?

490
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:03,430
It is not like that.

491
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:08,201
If we don't know something right or
wrong, then who will tell us?

492
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:10,308
God, right?
- Is it?

493
00:47:22,189 --> 00:47:24,157
What happened?
You have some doubt?

494
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:25,448
No. Nothing.

495
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:28,319
Yes. Your face is saying that.

496
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:32,955
Would the flower blossom if
somebody who doesn't have...

497
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,565
...money with him goes to pray?

498
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:38,970
That depends on the person
who needs it.

499
00:47:40,374 --> 00:47:42,103
What purpose does God need money?

500
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:45,503
For someone, reply would be
in lotus pond, for some others...

501
00:47:45,879 --> 00:47:49,007
...it would be on the branch
of the banyan tree...

502
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:54,083
...and sometimes in sky,
stars, clouds, etcetera.

503
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:57,912
Everybody is asking
including me.

504
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:01,761
But I am not getting
a satisfying answer.

505
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:39,629
"Four people who are having the blaze
of sun came and sat there slowly."

506
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:46,568
"Princess has lost the curse which
she got from the animal."

507
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:54,144
"Lord Rama had slowly
caught the hand of Sita."

508
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:01,643
I went to the post office. I booked
a phone and sat for long time.

509
00:49:02,456 --> 00:49:03,423
But I didn't get it.

510
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:19,839
Here.

511
00:49:22,809 --> 00:49:24,003
I will eat later.

512
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:28,848
Come at night.

513
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:30,683
Kunjimalu.

514
00:50:25,338 --> 00:50:30,640
"He has become a lover."
"More than that he is infatuated."

515
00:50:30,844 --> 00:50:35,975
"Is the moon standing
at the step in hurry?"

516
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:41,585
"He has become a lover."
"More than that he is infatuated."

517
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:46,816
"Is the moon standing
at the step in hurry?"

518
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:52,493
"The flower which hasn't
blossomed has been moving..."

519
00:50:52,699 --> 00:50:57,659
"...today without its knowledge."

520
00:50:57,871 --> 00:51:03,173
"New shining..."
"Has slight sleep."

521
00:51:03,543 --> 00:51:08,845
"He has become a lover."
"More than that he is infatuated."

522
00:51:09,049 --> 00:51:14,351
"Is the moon standing
at the step in hurry?"

523
00:51:14,554 --> 00:51:19,856
"Is in hurry to come down."

524
00:51:56,830 --> 00:52:08,901
"Fun and smile fills the mind."
"Water floats due to chill."

525
00:52:09,109 --> 00:52:18,916
"Sun and shadow comes in the yard."
"Eyes are moving with lust."

526
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:21,587
"Is it due to the fear in mind..."

527
00:52:21,788 --> 00:52:24,256
"Is it due to see more?"

528
00:52:24,457 --> 00:52:30,418
"Just come and sit with me
on the steps."

529
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:33,258
"Waiting is sorrowful."

530
00:52:33,466 --> 00:52:41,532
"Watching in silence."
- "Silence."

531
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:47,107
"He has become a lover."
"More than that he is infatuated."

532
00:52:47,314 --> 00:52:52,547
"Is the moon standing
at the step in hurry?"

533
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:57,951
"Is in hurry to come down."

534
00:53:28,255 --> 00:53:39,154
"River and rain touches the head."
"That creates a good feeling."

535
00:53:39,366 --> 00:53:49,002
"Blue flower forgets
to blossom in the mind."

536
00:53:49,209 --> 00:53:51,677
"Sometimes I feel shy and
sometimes not."

537
00:53:51,878 --> 00:53:54,346
"Listens music to live."

538
00:53:54,547 --> 00:54:00,508
"Days left alone."

539
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,188
"With the smell of night..."

540
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:11,195
"With the beauty of night light..."
- "...will join again."

541
00:54:11,932 --> 00:54:17,199
"He has become a lover."
"More than that he is infatuated."

542
00:54:17,404 --> 00:54:22,706
"Is the moon standing
at the step in hurry?"

543
00:54:22,909 --> 00:54:28,313
"Is in hurry to come down."

544
00:55:20,033 --> 00:55:22,331
This time nobody has prayed by
keeping money on the steps.

545
00:55:22,535 --> 00:55:23,763
Praying by keeping money
is not important.

546
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:26,768
That is only one custom.
Someone may have prayed devotionally.

547
00:55:26,973 --> 00:55:28,531
It had happened early too.

548
00:55:36,883 --> 00:55:38,510
You got the hand itself.

549
00:55:39,019 --> 00:55:39,644
Not this.

550
00:55:39,853 --> 00:55:40,581
Don't be in hurry.

551
00:55:40,787 --> 00:55:41,617
This one!

552
00:55:42,956 --> 00:55:43,820
Look, what is that?

553
00:55:44,024 --> 00:55:45,548
I too got one.

554
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:47,818
Now, I want to see you playing.

555
00:55:51,331 --> 00:55:52,559
You put the card.

556
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:08,671
"What is life?"

557
00:57:08,875 --> 00:57:12,106
"What is happiness?"

558
00:57:12,312 --> 00:57:15,440
"What is life?"

559
00:57:15,648 --> 00:57:19,015
"What is happiness?"

560
00:57:19,219 --> 00:57:22,552
"What is life?"

561
00:57:22,755 --> 00:57:25,588
"What is happiness?"

562
00:57:25,792 --> 00:57:32,664
"Only God knows that."

563
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:36,393
"What is life?"

564
00:57:36,603 --> 00:57:39,731
"What is happiness?"

565
00:57:39,973 --> 00:57:47,311
"Only God knows that."

566
00:57:47,514 --> 00:57:50,642
"What is life?"

567
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:56,049
"What is happiness?"

568
00:57:59,592 --> 00:58:07,328
"Do not be stubborn.
Stop that for now."

569
00:58:07,534 --> 00:58:13,234
"This night will not return."

570
00:58:13,506 --> 00:58:18,739
"Do not be stubborn.
Stop that for now."

571
00:58:18,945 --> 00:58:24,144
"This night will not return."

572
00:58:24,350 --> 00:58:29,447
"You may not agree,
yet it is my declaration..."

573
00:58:29,656 --> 00:58:34,753
"Realisation of the truth
will come to you."

574
00:58:34,961 --> 00:58:40,160
"So do not stop."

575
00:58:40,366 --> 00:58:45,599
"This night will not return."

576
00:59:17,704 --> 00:59:23,165
"Should I pray?
Should I offer obeisance?"

577
00:59:23,376 --> 00:59:28,211
"You only say what I should do."

578
00:59:28,414 --> 00:59:33,750
"Should I pray?
Should I offer obeisance?"

579
00:59:33,953 --> 00:59:38,754
"You only say what I should do."

580
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:44,055
"I feel your gaze on me..."

581
00:59:44,264 --> 00:59:49,395
"...Making me have faith in you."

582
00:59:49,602 --> 00:59:54,767
"Do not be stubborn."
"Halt that for now."

583
00:59:54,974 --> 01:00:00,105
"This night will not return."

584
01:00:00,313 --> 01:00:05,216
"You may not agree,
yet it is my declaration..."

585
01:00:05,418 --> 01:00:10,685
"Realisation of the truth
will come to you."

586
01:00:47,493 --> 01:00:57,869
"Pause amidst desire."
"The body is on fire."

587
01:00:58,071 --> 01:01:08,311
"Every moment is..."
"...full of completeness."

588
01:01:08,514 --> 01:01:18,719
"All that occurred in our past life..."
"...is bound to return tonight."

589
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:24,022
"Do not be stubborn.
Stop that for now."

590
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:29,167
"This night will not return."

591
01:01:32,672 --> 01:01:33,604
Here. Here.

592
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:36,871
My sister has given birth.
It's a baby girl again.

593
01:01:37,143 --> 01:01:39,907
I went there for buying poppadum.

594
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:42,308
Dasan likes poppadums very much.

595
01:01:43,583 --> 01:01:44,572
You want to see the baby.

596
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:47,048
She has got good colour
and lot of hair.

597
01:01:47,253 --> 01:01:48,345
I will come later.

598
01:01:50,323 --> 01:01:52,621
Ammini, do you know English?

599
01:01:52,892 --> 01:01:55,861
What happened?
I know a little bit.

600
01:01:56,429 --> 01:02:01,958
Sister's husband sometimes
teaches me little bit.

601
01:02:03,903 --> 01:02:10,467
What is the meaning of safe?
- I think it means cupboard.

602
01:02:12,445 --> 01:02:13,070
Then what is the meaning of sweet?

603
01:02:13,279 --> 01:02:14,940
Sweet means everything
which is delicious.

604
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:17,116
The dishes like laddu (round sweets)
etcetera are called sweets.

605
01:02:17,683 --> 01:02:19,583
Who is there to give you
lecture in English?

606
01:02:19,786 --> 01:02:21,811
No one. I just asked.
That's all.

607
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:23,087
Be careful.

608
01:02:23,289 --> 01:02:25,086
If English is started,
then be careful.

609
01:02:25,291 --> 01:02:27,919
Someone else has started
speaking English to me.

610
01:02:28,895 --> 01:02:32,729
Has advocate started teaching
you English? - You are mad.

611
01:02:42,909 --> 01:02:45,935
I am going to post office.

612
01:02:46,145 --> 01:02:48,670
If I get the professor under control then
I could know the result early.

613
01:02:48,881 --> 01:02:50,439
Are you scared
about your exams?

614
01:02:50,650 --> 01:02:51,412
I can't say anything about that.

615
01:02:51,617 --> 01:02:53,517
You don't worry.
Nothing will happen.

616
01:02:53,719 --> 01:02:55,448
I will make everything proper.

617
01:02:56,489 --> 01:02:59,185
I am not joking.
There is one solution for all that.

618
01:02:59,392 --> 01:03:00,984
Are you one among
the Board of Examiners?

619
01:03:01,427 --> 01:03:02,223
What?
What did you say?

620
01:03:02,428 --> 01:03:06,421
You are not putting the marks.
- Don't tease me.

621
01:03:06,632 --> 01:03:08,190
There is a person
who knows everything.

622
01:03:13,105 --> 01:03:16,370
It is for you.
Don't be in hurry. Drink.

623
01:03:20,847 --> 01:03:22,439
I want one rupee.

624
01:03:22,648 --> 01:03:24,206
Has someone come
from your house?

625
01:03:24,417 --> 01:03:26,214
This is for an offering in
the temple.

626
01:03:26,419 --> 01:03:30,116
One rupee note is there in
the coin box. Take from that.

627
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:40,461
She is from a Vellalapillai family.
Her behaviour is good.

628
01:03:40,666 --> 01:03:42,793
She is also a believer in God.
Very nice girl.

629
01:03:43,002 --> 01:03:47,166
Meenakshi had given me rice and
curry in an unmannered way.

630
01:03:47,373 --> 01:03:49,273
She is not like that.

631
01:04:22,308 --> 01:04:23,673
Didn't you tell me that?

632
01:04:24,076 --> 01:04:27,045
I will not tell you about that.
- Then it won't be a small matter.

633
01:04:27,246 --> 01:04:28,804
You kept Re.1 and prayed.

634
01:04:29,982 --> 01:04:31,643
May I tell you?
- Yes.

635
01:04:32,184 --> 01:04:34,379
One proposal has come
for Kunjimalu.

636
01:04:34,587 --> 01:04:39,081
You want to know if
it would happen or not. - No...

637
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:42,693
I will tell you later.
Please don't ask me anything now.

638
01:05:01,614 --> 01:05:03,275
Where is my mother?
- She is in the kitchen.

639
01:05:06,953 --> 01:05:08,750
Now, don't worry about the exam.

640
01:05:08,955 --> 01:05:10,855
Whatever you have expected,
all that will be fulfilled soon.

641
01:05:11,057 --> 01:05:11,853
Look.

642
01:05:16,996 --> 01:05:18,088
This is temple's offering.

643
01:05:18,297 --> 01:05:20,857
For my offering, whatever you
expected all that will be fulfilled.

644
01:05:25,037 --> 01:05:26,504
Yes.
- A telegram for you.

645
01:05:27,873 --> 01:05:28,931
I have opened it.

646
01:05:29,642 --> 01:05:30,973
This is uncle Balan's telegram.

647
01:05:33,045 --> 01:05:36,105
I passed the exam with distinction.
- That means?

648
01:05:36,315 --> 01:05:37,782
I got marks more than first class.

649
01:05:37,984 --> 01:05:39,417
I am going to tell your mother.

650
01:05:41,654 --> 01:05:42,552
Oh! My God!

651
01:05:59,238 --> 01:06:01,706
Postman is not appointed.
Only delivery agent is there.

652
01:06:01,907 --> 01:06:04,137
He will give the letter
at the nearby restaurant.

653
01:06:12,952 --> 01:06:14,283
I kept tea for you.

654
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:17,252
Bring here.
- Snack is also there.

655
01:06:19,025 --> 01:06:21,323
I made your favourite snack.

656
01:06:21,527 --> 01:06:24,462
Mother will say something based
on what I liked in my childhood.

657
01:06:26,932 --> 01:06:28,331
He came from my house.

658
01:06:30,036 --> 01:06:30,866
Please sit.

659
01:06:33,105 --> 01:06:35,096
I have come to Palathara market.

660
01:06:35,741 --> 01:06:37,800
So, I thought to meet you.

661
01:06:39,512 --> 01:06:41,605
Is he the advocate?

662
01:06:43,182 --> 01:06:44,342
His studies are over.

663
01:06:44,550 --> 01:06:45,642
But he's not become
an advocate yet.

664
01:06:47,219 --> 01:06:49,016
I have sent this month's salary
in the hands of Achuthan Nair.

665
01:06:49,221 --> 01:06:52,657
I didn't come to collect that.
That is a relief for grandmother.

666
01:06:52,958 --> 01:06:56,758
With that also her burden won't end.

667
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:03,599
I have to inform the bakery shop.
This is a new company.

668
01:07:03,803 --> 01:07:05,327
They will give me
reasonable salary too.

669
01:07:05,938 --> 01:07:09,806
Everybody is saying not to go.
Do something here.

670
01:07:10,009 --> 01:07:11,101
What is your opinion?

671
01:07:11,677 --> 01:07:15,477
I am not to decide that.
- You should also think.

672
01:07:15,681 --> 01:07:16,545
What you are thinking?

673
01:07:16,749 --> 01:07:18,478
Are you thinking of working
in someone's house always?

674
01:07:18,684 --> 01:07:20,049
Who is this? Appukuttan!

675
01:07:20,252 --> 01:07:22,584
Kunjimalu, give him one cup of tea.
- No.

676
01:07:22,788 --> 01:07:25,052
I came to this palace.
So, I just came to meet her.

677
01:07:25,257 --> 01:07:29,591
She is having no problem here.
I am looking her like my own child.

678
01:07:37,269 --> 01:07:40,067
He wants to marry you, right?

679
01:07:41,107 --> 01:07:41,766
Who told you?

680
01:07:41,974 --> 01:07:45,910
I understood that
by reading his face.

681
01:07:46,112 --> 01:07:47,704
What is wrong in that?

682
01:08:00,993 --> 01:08:02,790
Kunjimalu, where is the packet
containing Kondattam?

683
01:08:02,995 --> 01:08:05,054
It is there.
- Have it.

684
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,464
I have wrapped it with clothes.
It won't float.

685
01:08:10,669 --> 01:08:12,637
If you want anything else
then write a letter to me.

686
01:08:12,838 --> 01:08:13,770
Achuthan will bring that to you.
- Yes.

687
01:08:13,973 --> 01:08:15,600
Mother, I am not going
to a far place.

688
01:08:15,808 --> 01:08:17,298
I will come here on
every Saturday and Sunday.

689
01:08:31,957 --> 01:08:34,187
You come inside.
Dasan is going.

690
01:08:37,163 --> 01:08:40,564
Vellalapillai girls are not good
for premonition. - Yes.

691
01:08:44,336 --> 01:08:46,861
I will send you letter.
- Okay.

692
01:08:47,907 --> 01:08:49,875
Soon after he completed his studies,
he got a job too.

693
01:08:50,075 --> 01:08:51,337
Everything is God's blessings.

694
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:54,104
Oh! Vellalapillai girls are
not good for premonition!

695
01:08:54,513 --> 01:08:56,981
She is saying because of
her prayer only he got a job.

696
01:08:57,183 --> 01:08:58,241
Anyone knows the truth.

697
01:10:14,994 --> 01:10:17,053
Take sugar separately.
- Okay.

698
01:10:17,263 --> 01:10:19,493
I don't know whether
he is using sugar or not.

699
01:10:19,698 --> 01:10:22,496
If they are also for lunch then
I have to make one more curry.

700
01:10:22,701 --> 01:10:26,865
No. The clerk told me that
they are going soon.

701
01:10:27,539 --> 01:10:30,099
They have one more
house in Ottapalam.

702
01:10:31,277 --> 01:10:34,075
Keep all this on the table.
I will make tea.

703
01:10:46,625 --> 01:10:49,651
No snacks are there to give you.

704
01:10:50,429 --> 01:10:53,694
Go after lunch.
Lunch is ready.

705
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:55,694
Two people are standing outside.

706
01:10:55,901 --> 01:10:57,766
Kunjimalu, give these to them too.
- Okay.

707
01:10:59,238 --> 01:11:01,900
His job is nice.
Quarters are also good.

708
01:11:02,408 --> 01:11:04,376
Earlier, that was the bungalow
of a foreigner.

709
01:11:05,077 --> 01:11:06,339
Ratnam also liked everything.

710
01:11:06,545 --> 01:11:09,571
She needs space for making garden.
There is a big yard.

711
01:11:10,316 --> 01:11:12,750
I am planning to conduct
the marriage before July.

712
01:11:13,085 --> 01:11:14,347
We are not outsiders.

713
01:11:14,553 --> 01:11:17,215
So, there is no need to waste time
for seeing girl engagement, etcetera.

714
01:11:17,656 --> 01:11:20,716
But Haridas is saying he wants
to get married after sometime.

715
01:11:20,926 --> 01:11:22,393
His job will also be
permanent by that time.

716
01:11:22,594 --> 01:11:23,686
There is no such problem
with his job.

717
01:11:24,096 --> 01:11:25,961
I am handling most of
the cases of the company.

718
01:11:26,165 --> 01:11:29,657
They took him because
of my recommendation.

719
01:11:29,868 --> 01:11:32,894
Do you know that?
- He knows all that. Even then...

720
01:11:33,138 --> 01:11:36,904
Do you know Ratnam's age?
She is 24 now.

721
01:11:37,109 --> 01:11:39,976
Lot of proposals came for her.
She didn't like.

722
01:11:40,179 --> 01:11:41,703
She wants to marry only Dasan.

723
01:11:42,614 --> 01:11:46,914
He also knows that.
He stayed there for four years.

724
01:11:47,553 --> 01:11:50,750
It is very difficult to get a
good marriage hall at Guruvayoor.

725
01:11:51,857 --> 01:11:57,853
Our progenitors said to
slap him and then send him.

726
01:11:58,063 --> 01:11:58,859
That is enough, right?

727
01:12:06,138 --> 01:12:07,696
When coming here,
you arrange tea party for...

728
01:12:07,873 --> 01:12:10,273
...distant relatives and
lunch for our close relatives.

729
01:12:10,476 --> 01:12:11,966
Whoever wants to,
let them come to Guruvayoor.

730
01:12:12,177 --> 01:12:15,271
I will arrange food for 500 people there.
No need to have luxury.

731
01:12:15,481 --> 01:12:17,108
If his friends come a day
before marriage, then I will...

732
01:12:17,316 --> 01:12:19,682
...book two floors
in Dwaraka on rent.

733
01:12:19,885 --> 01:12:22,046
Now, I am not getting his letter.
No news about him.

734
01:12:22,254 --> 01:12:27,123
I will inform after he comes.
I told him to come tomorrow.

735
01:12:38,070 --> 01:12:40,538
Don't make anything more.
They are not waiting to have lunch.

736
01:12:41,006 --> 01:12:46,034
When they took him for studies,
I expected that. - So what?

737
01:12:46,245 --> 01:12:49,078
Balan will get a boy better
than my son for his daughter.

738
01:12:49,281 --> 01:12:51,044
It is a big thing that they
have come for this alliance.

739
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:52,683
Malukuty!
- Yes.

740
01:13:25,184 --> 01:13:26,913
Someone is there in
front of the house.

741
01:13:27,519 --> 01:13:30,579
Why did you walk so much?

742
01:13:31,323 --> 01:13:33,450
Appukuttan is not
giving me any relief.

743
01:13:35,961 --> 01:13:38,486
He is asking me
when you will come.

744
01:13:40,132 --> 01:13:42,862
How can I come just like that?

745
01:13:44,236 --> 01:13:45,328
Give me one piece of tobacco.

746
01:13:45,537 --> 01:13:48,062
Kunjimalu.
- Yes. I will come.

747
01:13:58,350 --> 01:14:00,580
Your grandmother came again, right?

748
01:14:02,554 --> 01:14:04,784
After marriage, you go back.

749
01:14:09,294 --> 01:14:11,956
Appukuttan is also a nice fellow.

750
01:14:12,164 --> 01:14:14,758
He will get a job outside and
you can help your family too.

751
01:14:17,202 --> 01:14:22,162
In our age, we will dream that
a prince will come and marry us.

752
01:14:22,574 --> 01:14:23,905
Nothing will happen.

753
01:14:24,343 --> 01:14:25,367
That is my experience.

754
01:14:28,614 --> 01:14:30,309
Malukuty Amma!
- Yes!

755
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:36,111
I have seen Das coming.
This is fresh fish.

756
01:14:36,321 --> 01:14:37,811
You give that fish
at Achuthan's house.

757
01:14:38,023 --> 01:14:39,684
We are alone here.

758
01:14:40,792 --> 01:14:42,987
I told him to go in the morning.

759
01:14:43,462 --> 01:14:47,523
He panicked.
Balan did everything fast.

760
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:51,601
After all, for his marriage,
he too has some opinion.

761
01:14:52,404 --> 01:14:53,701
Then, I am going.

762
01:15:54,933 --> 01:15:57,128
Not to that side.
This side is east.

763
01:15:57,369 --> 01:16:00,429
I told him to buy
a new bed and coat.

764
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:02,630
They are not going to stay here.

765
01:16:02,841 --> 01:16:05,173
Then too.
They need one bedroom here.

766
01:16:05,777 --> 01:16:11,807
Keep some fruits
on that round table.

767
01:16:12,017 --> 01:16:13,484
Why didn't you go for marriage?

768
01:16:13,685 --> 01:16:17,587
Mother doesn't go for son's marriage.
That is an old custom.

769
01:16:17,789 --> 01:16:19,222
Now, all that might be changed.

770
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:26,795
Now, lunch may start after marriage.
Achuthan will come early.

771
01:16:26,999 --> 01:16:32,335
He will arrange everything for
the workers. You too help them.

772
01:16:34,139 --> 01:16:37,165
Usually, this is done
by sister or aunt.

773
01:16:37,376 --> 01:16:40,504
No one is there for him.
You got that luck.

774
01:16:56,662 --> 01:16:58,289
What happened?
Are you not well?

775
01:17:11,510 --> 01:17:19,144
Singer had fainted yesterday.
He lost his sound.

776
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:29,857
Now, I remain.

777
01:17:34,566 --> 01:17:38,525
The singer's sound loss
is equivalent to his death.

778
01:17:43,942 --> 01:17:45,136
Next is me.

779
01:17:45,977 --> 01:17:47,774
For me, it would be
a mental disease.

780
01:17:49,114 --> 01:17:50,581
Severe mental disease.

781
01:17:56,988 --> 01:18:00,890
Oh, God! Call me back before that.

782
01:18:50,308 --> 01:18:51,798
Ratnam, you didn't sleep yet?

783
01:18:54,212 --> 01:18:57,147
I don't know. I didn't feel sleepy.

784
01:19:02,287 --> 01:19:04,551
Sometimes, I feel he is
there on the top floor.

785
01:19:05,190 --> 01:19:10,218
I feel his tread.
I feel he had put on the music.

786
01:20:07,652 --> 01:20:09,620
First, both of you
should pray in the temple.

787
01:20:28,940 --> 01:20:30,407
Go inside and pray.

788
01:20:43,555 --> 01:20:44,522
Take the offering.

789
01:20:49,194 --> 01:20:49,990
God bless you.

790
01:21:01,606 --> 01:21:03,870
Look. One special flower
will blossom there.

791
01:21:04,442 --> 01:21:05,966
Keep money and pray.

792
01:21:06,177 --> 01:21:07,872
If the flower is blossomed on the next day,
then that wish will be fulfilled.

793
01:21:08,647 --> 01:21:09,875
Did you hear about this?
- No.

794
01:21:10,081 --> 01:21:11,946
The people here believe it.

795
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:16,413
Dasan, have you ever tested?
- Me...

796
01:21:17,556 --> 01:21:20,047
No.
That's all madness.

797
01:22:44,142 --> 01:22:46,076
Have you given something to
eat for outside workers? - Yes.

798
01:22:47,178 --> 01:22:49,408
How long you are working here?
- Four-five months.

799
01:22:50,482 --> 01:22:52,677
If it is for top stairs,
take normal water.

800
01:22:52,884 --> 01:22:54,317
He won't drink cumin water.

801
01:23:04,562 --> 01:23:06,826
Now also people are
there in the frontage.

802
01:23:08,199 --> 01:23:11,657
While sleeping, close the
window at the south side.

803
01:23:11,870 --> 01:23:14,395
Cat will come through that side.

804
01:23:14,706 --> 01:23:16,537
Kunjimalu, are you taking
bath in the temple pond?

805
01:23:17,075 --> 01:23:18,770
If we keep money then
the flower will blossom.

806
01:23:18,977 --> 01:23:21,138
If the flower has blossomed
then our wish will be fulfilled. Is it true?

807
01:23:23,948 --> 01:23:25,643
People are saying like that.

808
01:23:25,850 --> 01:23:27,477
Kunjimalu, have you ever tested that?

809
01:23:32,390 --> 01:23:34,551
Kunjimalu, in the morning,
we need more milk.

810
01:23:34,759 --> 01:23:36,249
I forgot to tell Achuthan.

811
01:23:36,461 --> 01:23:40,261
I informed Embranthiri.
- Oh! You remembered that!

812
01:23:40,999 --> 01:23:42,660
Be careful while stepping
the staircase.

813
01:23:42,867 --> 01:23:44,994
The third step is broken.

814
01:23:47,806 --> 01:23:49,103
She will do everything.

815
01:23:49,307 --> 01:23:51,867
Her grandmother told me to
send her back after marriage.

816
01:23:52,077 --> 01:23:53,237
I have agreed that half-minded.

817
01:23:53,445 --> 01:23:55,572
Why she is going back?
- She is not hurry.

818
01:23:55,780 --> 01:23:59,648
Her uncle's son is in hurry.
He wants to marry her soon.

819
01:24:08,359 --> 01:24:35,915
"Lord Ram, Lord Ram..."

820
01:24:36,087 --> 01:24:37,076
Did you sleep?

821
01:24:38,123 --> 01:24:39,920
No. What happened?

822
01:24:40,125 --> 01:24:42,685
Singer is not able to sing now.

823
01:24:44,062 --> 01:24:46,553
Then who is singing now?

824
01:24:52,137 --> 01:24:55,231
I am not hearing anything.
You may felt that.

825
01:25:51,896 --> 01:26:00,031
"The small lotus in the path
of the disappeared daylight..."

826
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:09,146
"Who you are searching for..."
"With the mind full of pain..."

827
01:26:10,014 --> 01:26:18,183
"Like a pale blue..."
"You will be alone now."

828
01:26:18,389 --> 01:26:25,227
"Remain as pain in the
gloomy pond."

829
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:33,496
"The small lotus in the path
of the disappeared daylight."

830
01:26:33,705 --> 01:26:42,670
"Who you are searching for?"
"With the mind full of pain..."

831
01:27:23,187 --> 01:27:31,424
"In the morning..."
"Daylight will kiss."

832
01:27:31,629 --> 01:27:39,764
"Spring will come with
a little provocation."

833
01:27:39,971 --> 01:27:41,905
"When you are alone..."

834
01:27:42,106 --> 01:27:48,477
"When you come to the yard..."
"You heart will twitch."

835
01:27:55,720 --> 01:28:03,923
"There would be some broken song..."
"...on your dry lips."

836
01:28:04,128 --> 01:28:12,297
"You turn to see someone coming."

837
01:28:12,503 --> 01:28:20,433
"One spine pierced into your mind..."
"Your mind is burning..."

838
01:28:20,645 --> 01:28:29,781
"The small lotus in the path
of the disappeared daylight."

839
01:29:01,719 --> 01:29:09,888
"Well-being is burning..."
"Like fire in your mind."

840
01:29:10,094 --> 01:29:18,263
"Voice is soaking like pain..."
"In the petal."

841
01:29:18,469 --> 01:29:27,002
"Even then you cuddle the eyes."

842
01:29:34,218 --> 01:29:38,177
"Your dreams are burnt
during when you blossomed..."

843
01:29:38,389 --> 01:29:50,699
"You are blossomed
only for crying."

844
01:29:50,902 --> 01:29:58,866
"Earlier and now,
your dreams are the same."

845
01:29:59,077 --> 01:30:07,246
"The small lotus in the path
of the disappeared daylight."

846
01:30:07,452 --> 01:30:17,054
"Whom you are searching for?"
"With the mind full of pain."

847
01:30:52,430 --> 01:30:53,294
Ammini.

848
01:30:56,067 --> 01:30:57,762
Nowadays, you are not seeing out.

849
01:30:57,969 --> 01:31:00,733
Your sister and children already left.
Then why are you busy?

850
01:31:01,105 --> 01:31:02,595
I am not well.

851
01:31:04,709 --> 01:31:06,176
I am also busy there.

852
01:31:09,780 --> 01:31:11,680
Meet you tomorrow morning.
- See you tomorrow.

853
01:31:11,916 --> 01:31:12,507
I am also coming.

854
01:31:12,717 --> 01:31:16,676
I kept money on the step
and prayed.

855
01:31:16,988 --> 01:31:18,751
Don't try to test God.

856
01:31:21,159 --> 01:31:22,854
I don't know cooking.

857
01:31:23,060 --> 01:31:25,654
Mother told me you know to
make food which Dasan likes.

858
01:31:27,431 --> 01:31:29,899
Are you coming with us
to Ernakulam?

859
01:31:33,471 --> 01:31:35,166
Mother will get someone else.

860
01:31:36,374 --> 01:31:37,602
Let mother decide.

861
01:31:39,644 --> 01:31:40,633
What about your marriage?

862
01:31:40,845 --> 01:31:42,278
Do you like him?

863
01:31:43,881 --> 01:31:46,042
I don't have any love
or hatred toward him.

864
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:47,376
Let mother decide.

865
01:31:47,585 --> 01:31:50,486
Don't you make your own decision?

866
01:31:50,688 --> 01:31:54,124
What is use of my decision?

867
01:32:10,041 --> 01:32:12,305
I am going to give my old saris
to that girl.

868
01:32:12,510 --> 01:32:14,273
Who?
- Kunjimalu.

869
01:32:14,745 --> 01:32:17,009
I am taking her out by wearing sari.

870
01:32:17,215 --> 01:32:18,079
For a walk.

871
01:32:18,282 --> 01:32:20,807
Buy a new sari for her
as a marriage gift.

872
01:32:21,252 --> 01:32:23,686
This is not too old.
This will suit her nicely.

873
01:32:23,888 --> 01:32:27,619
If she wears a sari, she looks like a girl
belonging to a reputed family.

874
01:32:38,202 --> 01:32:39,499
Mother, where is Kunjimalu?

875
01:32:39,704 --> 01:32:41,069
Not in the kitchen?
- No.

876
01:32:41,272 --> 01:32:44,036
Then she may have gone to
the garden to tie the cow.

877
01:34:43,928 --> 01:34:46,829
The company will provide security
and the gardener.

878
01:34:47,031 --> 01:34:50,091
Shall we take Kunjimalu
there to cook?

879
01:34:50,301 --> 01:34:51,632
Then who is there with mother?

880
01:34:51,836 --> 01:34:53,167
She will stay here till
her marriage.

881
01:34:53,371 --> 01:34:54,963
When she leaves,
we will give her some money.

882
01:34:55,239 --> 01:34:56,831
For all her help,
what will we give?

883
01:34:57,041 --> 01:34:58,508
Only some of my old saris and...

884
01:34:58,709 --> 01:35:00,267
...give some money as
your contribution.

885
01:35:00,611 --> 01:35:03,341
How much are you planning to give?
25 or 30?

886
01:35:03,581 --> 01:35:05,071
Ratnam, what else to give?

887
01:35:05,282 --> 01:35:06,647
That much is enough.

888
01:35:07,551 --> 01:35:11,783
Seeing them afterwards would
create uneasiness, right?

889
01:35:11,989 --> 01:35:13,013
Then avoid them soon.

890
01:35:13,224 --> 01:35:14,418
Till marriage, she can stay
here with mother.

891
01:35:14,625 --> 01:35:15,683
Why should I avoid her?

892
01:35:15,893 --> 01:35:17,417
When you come here inquiring
about mother, that...

893
01:35:17,628 --> 01:35:19,152
...time you want another
person here.

894
01:35:19,730 --> 01:35:20,697
I didn't get you.

895
01:35:20,898 --> 01:35:22,456
Dasan, you are an expert.

896
01:35:22,666 --> 01:35:23,189
Clever!

897
01:35:23,401 --> 01:35:24,800
No danger had happened.

898
01:35:25,002 --> 01:35:26,731
No rumour, no threat,
no non-violent protest.

899
01:35:26,937 --> 01:35:27,596
Nothing... happened.

900
01:35:27,805 --> 01:35:28,271
Clever!

901
01:35:28,472 --> 01:35:29,530
You are very clever.

902
01:35:29,740 --> 01:35:31,469
Ratnam! Don't talk nonsense.

903
01:35:35,746 --> 01:35:37,611
Sometimes I think about men.

904
01:35:37,815 --> 01:35:39,112
May I say something for controversy?

905
01:35:39,316 --> 01:35:41,682
The logic you studied in B.A.
has to be kept in its place.

906
01:35:41,919 --> 01:35:43,978
Sometimes I should be taken.
Otherwise I will forget everything.

907
01:35:44,188 --> 01:35:48,090
Suppose, I had an affair before marriage
and you came to know that.

908
01:35:48,292 --> 01:35:49,884
Then what would be your reaction?

909
01:35:52,630 --> 01:35:53,654
She is the servant.

910
01:35:53,864 --> 01:35:56,162
At any situation, there may be
somebody to marry her.

911
01:35:56,367 --> 01:35:57,698
Now, you are feeling relieved, right?

912
01:35:57,902 --> 01:35:59,494
Oh! Now itself you started
eating my brain.

913
01:35:59,804 --> 01:36:03,331
You terrible hypocrite.
You have seen only humble servants.

914
01:36:03,541 --> 01:36:04,064
No.

915
01:36:04,275 --> 01:36:08,075
I saw college girls from good family who
sleep with men if they get an opportunity.

916
01:36:08,813 --> 01:36:11,145
Money for studying!
Job in foreign company!

917
01:36:11,348 --> 01:36:12,975
My father has given you all this.

918
01:36:21,792 --> 01:36:22,622
What?

919
01:36:22,827 --> 01:36:24,351
Dasan!

920
01:36:25,496 --> 01:36:27,487
What? What happened?

921
01:36:28,966 --> 01:36:31,730
If you fight like this,
then what would be your future?

922
01:36:51,922 --> 01:36:53,287
I am informing at your house.

923
01:36:53,491 --> 01:36:54,355
You go from here.

924
01:36:54,592 --> 01:36:55,889
I am appointing another
servant here.

925
01:36:58,028 --> 01:37:00,929
For caring about that person,
I am here.

926
01:37:01,165 --> 01:37:02,029
Understood?

927
01:37:02,833 --> 01:37:03,800
Mother didn't tell anything.

928
01:37:04,001 --> 01:37:04,968
I am saying.

929
01:37:05,169 --> 01:37:06,898
Today onwards,
I am deciding everything here.

930
01:37:10,341 --> 01:37:11,137
I heard.

931
01:37:11,342 --> 01:37:13,537
I will give the set of keys
to you now itself.

932
01:37:13,978 --> 01:37:15,969
You keep it. And start ruling.

933
01:39:04,054 --> 01:39:05,021
Kunjimalu!

934
01:39:07,291 --> 01:39:08,258
Kunjimalu!

935
01:39:20,104 --> 01:39:21,036
Has she left?

936
01:39:22,306 --> 01:39:23,500
She won't go without informing me.

937
01:39:23,707 --> 01:39:28,474
There is one girl's dead body
in the temple pond.

938
01:39:30,314 --> 01:39:31,281
Oh, my God!

939
01:39:32,983 --> 01:39:35,315
People are running towards
temple pond.

940
01:39:39,490 --> 01:39:42,584
I thought educated people would
know about all safety measures.

941
01:39:51,502 --> 01:39:53,060
Where are you all running?

942
01:39:54,238 --> 01:39:56,297
Come fast!

943
01:39:56,507 --> 01:39:59,032
Who is that?

944
01:39:59,243 --> 01:40:01,473
Do you know who that is?
- No.

945
01:40:02,212 --> 01:40:03,509
She may jump into the
pond at night.

946
01:40:03,681 --> 01:40:04,841
Otherwise, it won't come up now.
- Is it?

947
01:40:05,015 --> 01:40:06,983
Who is that?
- Who?

948
01:40:17,394 --> 01:40:19,328
Move! Move!

949
01:40:34,945 --> 01:40:37,072
Sharady and
Sharasyar are still unconscious.

950
01:40:37,281 --> 01:40:39,408
She was so cruel.

951
01:40:39,883 --> 01:40:41,214
Who? Who had died?

952
01:40:41,452 --> 01:40:42,646
Ammini of Sharath house.

953
01:41:34,438 --> 01:41:36,565
"Life and death."

954
01:41:36,774 --> 01:41:42,178
"Life and death."

955
01:41:42,379 --> 01:41:43,073
Wait!

956
01:41:45,349 --> 01:41:47,317
Your friend had gone, right?

957
01:41:49,887 --> 01:41:53,220
"Those who enjoyed together,
by saying stories..."

958
01:41:54,091 --> 01:41:58,323
"Due to rain,
sunlight and darkness..."

959
01:41:59,229 --> 01:42:05,759
"They have left to different ways."

960
01:42:07,070 --> 01:42:09,903
"All are God's plays."

961
01:42:11,208 --> 01:42:14,541
"Those who enjoyed together,
by saying stories..."

962
01:42:15,679 --> 01:42:19,877
"Due to rain,
sunlight and darkness..."

963
01:42:32,229 --> 01:42:32,820
I am going.

964
01:42:33,030 --> 01:42:34,122
Who came from your house?

965
01:42:34,331 --> 01:42:35,298
Appukuttan.

966
01:42:35,732 --> 01:42:37,996
Has he not gone to make
bread till now?

967
01:42:38,702 --> 01:42:40,226
Grandmother didn't allow him.

968
01:42:40,871 --> 01:42:41,963
What grandmother says
is also right.

969
01:42:42,172 --> 01:42:45,107
Someone is needed to wash
people's clothes, right?

970
01:43:11,201 --> 01:43:12,998
How is your grandmother?

971
01:43:22,145 --> 01:43:24,079
I am going.
- Okay.

972
01:43:24,715 --> 01:43:25,511
Give me.

973
01:44:09,626 --> 01:44:11,924
Nice place, friend.
- Come.

974
01:44:12,129 --> 01:44:12,788
Yes.

975
01:44:21,571 --> 01:44:23,129
Your mother left early.

976
01:44:23,473 --> 01:44:24,906
That is because she knew
that I was coming.

977
01:44:28,779 --> 01:44:31,111
This is Prasad. He is an Engineer.
- Hi.

978
01:44:31,548 --> 01:44:35,848
Engineer means he designs
big hotels, buildings etc.

979
01:44:36,053 --> 01:44:37,486
What to say for that?

980
01:44:37,988 --> 01:44:39,649
Architect. Am I correct?

981
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:45,260
Prasad is saying we can modify
this house into a...

982
01:44:45,462 --> 01:44:48,590
...hotel...
a heritage hotel.

983
01:44:48,932 --> 01:44:50,263
We will get government's help too.

984
01:44:50,467 --> 01:44:55,700
Mother, the foreign tourists
like bungalows of this type.

985
01:44:55,939 --> 01:44:57,372
I don't have any problem in that.

986
01:44:57,574 --> 01:45:01,135
I need only one room to stay.
- Not now.

987
01:45:01,345 --> 01:45:03,245
I mean after grandmother's death.

988
01:45:03,647 --> 01:45:06,946
For that, a grave disease
has to strike.

989
01:45:07,150 --> 01:45:10,119
Grandmother, you have to
live some more time.

990
01:45:14,558 --> 01:45:17,254
Beneath that coconut there
are parrots.

991
01:45:18,261 --> 01:45:21,662
Two mongooses usually come
through this fence.

992
01:45:22,099 --> 01:45:23,964
It has three young ones.

993
01:45:26,436 --> 01:45:29,462
Waterfowl and its young ones
come in the yard everyday.

994
01:45:43,220 --> 01:45:45,051
Lots of birds are there.

995
01:45:45,255 --> 01:45:48,349
Everyday morning,
I wake up hearing their sounds.

996
01:45:50,060 --> 01:45:54,690
Don't cut trees.
Do you like the voice of birds?

997
01:45:55,165 --> 01:45:56,154
Nothing will happen.

998
01:45:56,366 --> 01:45:58,891
Prasad got some idea when
he saw this house.

999
01:46:07,244 --> 01:46:08,142
You went and prayed in
the temple, right?

1000
01:46:08,412 --> 01:46:09,879
Yes. I got a flower.

1001
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:11,445
That was blossomed yesterday.

1002
01:46:12,449 --> 01:46:14,144
I don't know whose prayer it is.

1003
01:46:14,351 --> 01:46:15,750
No one came to claim.

1004
01:46:15,952 --> 01:46:17,442
So, priest had given that
flower to me.

1005
01:46:21,825 --> 01:46:23,122
This is for you.

1006
01:46:23,493 --> 01:46:25,586
The flower has blossomed
when you came here.

1007
01:46:27,164 --> 01:46:29,155
I am having an old prayer.

1008
01:46:30,100 --> 01:46:33,467
I felt sad when you left here.

1009
01:46:34,337 --> 01:46:36,271
I prayed for your good life.

1010
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:39,873
That time I could do that only.

1011
01:46:43,180 --> 01:46:44,204
Paru has left.

1012
01:46:44,548 --> 01:46:46,072
That small girl is there.

1013
01:46:46,283 --> 01:46:48,046
No information about the home nurse.

1014
01:46:48,251 --> 01:46:50,481
Let them come as per
their convenience.

1015
01:46:50,754 --> 01:46:52,153
I will stay here with you.

1016
01:46:52,355 --> 01:46:53,822
I am not in hurry.

1017
01:46:54,324 --> 01:46:56,815
I have already informed
my husband, Appukuttan.

1018
01:47:05,602 --> 01:47:06,899
If you are feeling tired,
come and sleep for sometime.

1019
01:47:07,104 --> 01:47:07,729
Okay.

1020
01:47:13,743 --> 01:47:16,735
"Oh, blue lotus!"

1021
01:47:16,947 --> 01:47:20,280
"You have worn flowers..."

1022
01:47:20,484 --> 01:47:26,013
"In my mind."

1023
01:47:26,223 --> 01:47:29,158
"Oh, blue lotus!"

1024
01:47:29,359 --> 01:47:32,920
"You made waves..."

1025
01:47:33,130 --> 01:47:38,591
"...in river."

1026
01:47:38,802 --> 01:47:41,930
"You have worn the bunch
of peacock feathers.

1027
01:47:42,139 --> 01:47:44,767
"...which I wished
to see that day."

1028
01:47:44,975 --> 01:47:50,845
"One day, I became
wet in your tears."

1029
01:47:51,281 --> 01:47:57,447
"Sun is far away from here.
Oh, beauty, wake up slowly."

1030
01:47:57,654 --> 01:48:04,958
"My eyes are twinkling to see you."

1031
01:48:06,863 --> 01:48:09,457
"Oh, blue lotus."

1032
