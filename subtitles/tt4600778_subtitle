1
00:01:46,449 --> 00:01:48,479
- Roll no. 1.
- Present Miss.

2
00:01:48,612 --> 00:01:50,608
- Roll no. 2.
- Yes Miss.

3
00:01:50,797 --> 00:01:52,441
- 3.
- Yes Miss.

4
00:01:59,571 --> 00:02:01,524
A traveller whose name was Ramoji...

5
00:02:01,794 --> 00:02:04,015
was passing through Lalpur village.

6
00:02:04,202 --> 00:02:08,310
When Guru and Govind (God)...
are standing before you...

7
00:02:08,868 --> 00:02:10,254
who should you
pay respect to first?

8
00:03:16,426 --> 00:03:17,277
Okay.

9
00:03:18,772 --> 00:03:19,673
Come on.

10
00:03:20,027 --> 00:03:20,814
Now you come.

11
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:23,598
Here comes Hitler.

12
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,324
Now she’ll show-off her dictatorship.

13
00:03:28,753 --> 00:03:29,953
Horrible color.

14
00:03:30,254 --> 00:03:32,405
Mix it with some other color,
Manjeet.

15
00:03:32,557 --> 00:03:33,878
- Yes.
- Bad choice.

16
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,933
We’ll conquer the entire state.

17
00:03:37,013 --> 00:03:38,555
We’ll conquer.

18
00:03:38,792 --> 00:03:39,982
We’ll...

19
00:03:40,062 --> 00:03:41,139
Hello, ma’am.

20
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:43,303
If you do everything
what will the kids do?

21
00:03:44,404 --> 00:03:46,148
- Do it properly. Pull them up.
- Yes.

22
00:03:46,228 --> 00:03:47,138
Remember one thing.

23
00:03:47,218 --> 00:03:49,894
You should always be
able to see your parents.

24
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:52,041
Meaning... they should
be able to see you.

25
00:03:52,296 --> 00:03:54,046
If you stand behind each other...

26
00:03:54,126 --> 00:03:56,332
- then you will not be seen.
- Jyoti, can I see some rehearsals?

27
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:58,855
If you’ve finished
giving instructions?

28
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:00,804
Okay.

29
00:04:00,884 --> 00:04:02,879
Okay, children.
From the beginning.

30
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,895
Nusrat, music.

31
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:08,093
One, two, three, four...

32
00:04:08,387 --> 00:04:10,584
One, two, three, four!

33
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:13,197
One, two, three, four!

34
00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:15,821
One, two, three, four!

35
00:04:16,087 --> 00:04:16,891
Okay, that’s it.

36
00:04:18,513 --> 00:04:19,941
Not good enough.

37
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,619
Change their steps.

38
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:24,579
Make it better.

39
00:04:24,905 --> 00:04:26,455
Call the teachers, please.

40
00:04:26,997 --> 00:04:27,777
Okay...

41
00:04:27,857 --> 00:04:29,626
All teachers come here!

42
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,774
All teachers come here!

43
00:04:39,336 --> 00:04:41,860
This is the entire schedule
for tomorrow’s annual day...

44
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,703
along with your duty-charts.

45
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,829
Follow it exactly the way it is.

46
00:04:46,272 --> 00:04:47,775
Don’t make any mistakes.

47
00:04:48,058 --> 00:04:50,761
You’ve to report
at exactly 8am tomorrow.

48
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,146
Why 8am?

49
00:04:52,347 --> 00:04:54,097
The program starts at 12.

50
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,733
- Then why should we...
- No arguments, please.

51
00:04:57,295 --> 00:04:58,433
Principal’s orders.

52
00:04:59,502 --> 00:05:00,284
Leave.

53
00:05:08,255 --> 00:05:09,627
May I come in, ma’am?

54
00:05:10,094 --> 00:05:12,474
- Please come in, Ms. Gupta.
- Thank you.

55
00:05:14,377 --> 00:05:16,946
Our Directors will
arrive by 12pm tomorrow.

56
00:05:17,131 --> 00:05:20,044
Trustee Mansukh bhai and
his son Anmol’s coming too.

57
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,268
Anmol has done MBA from London.

58
00:05:22,618 --> 00:05:24,145
Have we finished
making all preparations?

59
00:05:24,398 --> 00:05:27,710
Yes, I am personally
supervising all the programs.

60
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,482
Here are the duty lists.

61
00:05:33,631 --> 00:05:34,454
Good.

62
00:05:35,814 --> 00:05:36,969
Very good.

63
00:05:39,498 --> 00:05:42,675
Change the teacher’s reporting
time to 10am instead of 8.

64
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:44,599
8 o’clock is too early.

65
00:05:45,547 --> 00:05:46,795
Rest all is fine.

66
00:05:46,963 --> 00:05:47,915
Sure.

67
00:05:50,106 --> 00:05:52,413
I thought,
tomorrow for the Annual Day...

68
00:05:52,493 --> 00:05:53,804
I won’t have to rush to school.

69
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,961
But that Hitler...
She won’t let anyone live in peace.

70
00:05:57,141 --> 00:06:00,105
I am sure it’s her conspiracy to
call everyone at 8 am in the morning.

71
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,927
She’s only using
Principal madam’s name.

72
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:05,916
Keeps bossing the teachers around.

73
00:06:06,071 --> 00:06:09,694
If only I could have it
my way, I would...

74
00:06:09,897 --> 00:06:10,898
Manjeet!

75
00:06:12,825 --> 00:06:14,122
Aren’t you ashamed...

76
00:06:15,554 --> 00:06:17,493
of humiliating your Supervisor?

77
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:19,495
What do you think?

78
00:06:19,943 --> 00:06:22,604
Don’t we know what’s
happening around the school?

79
00:06:22,755 --> 00:06:24,797
She sounds exactly like Gupta.

80
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:27,510
I’ve spies all around.

81
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:29,338
Am I right, Rupa?

82
00:06:31,938 --> 00:06:34,208
Yes, Madam.
You can never be wrong.

83
00:06:35,308 --> 00:06:36,340
Jyoti.

84
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:40,472
And you were smearing
lipstick on your face.

85
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:41,721
Oh, God!

86
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,429
Stop it.

87
00:06:45,444 --> 00:06:46,330
Very good.

88
00:06:47,554 --> 00:06:48,490
Quiet!

89
00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:52,126
Jyoti madam.
Please tell me one thing.

90
00:06:52,552 --> 00:06:54,949
You’re such a good actor.

91
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:57,771
You’re even a good dancer.

92
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,510
And I’ve even heard that...

93
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:02,189
you were a state-level
badminton player.

94
00:07:02,812 --> 00:07:06,211
- So, what I mean is...
- Wait a minute.

95
00:07:06,357 --> 00:07:08,045
Wait a minute, Mr. Chaturvedi.

96
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,190
Even in the staff room...

97
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,957
you sound like Tulsidas
is tutoring his pupils.

98
00:07:13,691 --> 00:07:15,490
Can’t you simply say...

99
00:07:15,652 --> 00:07:17,506
“Jyoti, since you’re so talented...”

100
00:07:17,644 --> 00:07:19,654
“...why don’t you take
up some better profession?”

101
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:23,677
“Why did you choose to be an ordinary science teacher in Kanta Ben school?”

102
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:27,060
Come on, Manjeet.
Ordinary teacher?

103
00:07:27,292 --> 00:07:31,305
We should be proud that
we’re in this noble profession.

104
00:07:31,853 --> 00:07:34,537
Can you imagine...
what this world would’ve been...

105
00:07:34,617 --> 00:07:35,895
without a teacher.

106
00:07:41,841 --> 00:07:45,031
<i>“The fear of Algebra is none”</i>

107
00:07:45,272 --> 00:07:48,670
<i>“When you learn it...
it’s full of fun”</i>

108
00:07:50,122 --> 00:07:52,882

109
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:56,411
<i>“When you learn it...
it’s full of fun”</i>

110
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:01,170
<i>“Once you know the values of X and Y”</i>

111
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,422
<i>“I promise you’ll score very high”</i>

112
00:08:10,893 --> 00:08:12,186
<i>“So children...”</i>

113
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,913
<i>“Today we will solve this equation...”</i>

114
00:08:14,993 --> 00:08:16,062
<i>“with the rule of...”</i>

115
00:08:16,142 --> 00:08:17,083
<i>“B...”</i>

116
00:08:17,688 --> 00:08:18,532
<i>“O...”</i>

117
00:08:19,322 --> 00:08:20,152

00:08:22,506 --> 00:08:23,376
<i>“A...”</i>

120
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:25,231
<i>“S...”</i>

121
00:08:25,678 --> 00:08:26,953
<i>“BODMAS...!”</i>

122
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:35,983
<i>“Solve the brackets first”</i>

123
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:36,805
<i>“BODMAS...!”</i>

124
00:08:36,885 --> 00:08:38,905
<i>“Orders come after that”</i>

125
00:08:39,238 --> 00:08:39,972
<i>“BODMAS...!”</i>

126
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:42,447
<i>“Divide and multiply”</i>

127
00:08:42,527 --> 00:08:43,235
<i>“BODMAS...!”</i>

128
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:45,980
<i>“Then you add then subtract”</i>

129
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,838
<i>“BODMAS...!”</i>

130
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:49,180
<i>“BODMAS...!”</i>

131
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:54,287
<i>“So children... now you
all tell me what is the answer”</i>

132
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,968
<i>“46”</i>

133
00:08:56,107 --> 00:08:57,518
<i>“Correct...”</i>

134
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,102
<i>“BODMAS...!”</i>

135
00:08:59,491 --> 00:09:00,708

00:09:00,901 --> 00:09:02,534
<i>“BODMAS...!”</i>

137
00:09:02,721 --> 00:09:03,931
<i>“BODMAS...!”</i>

138
00:09:04,067 --> 00:09:06,790
<i>“BODMAS...!”</i>

139
00:09:07,267 --> 00:09:09,454
<i>“BODMAS...!”</i>

140
00:09:09,736 --> 00:09:12,366
Iqbal, what do you
get if you give me a hug?

141
00:09:12,676 --> 00:09:13,868
Chocolate!

142
00:09:14,247 --> 00:09:15,243
Yes.

143
00:09:15,323 --> 00:09:19,134
Today... two students
in my class had birthdays.

144
00:09:19,215 --> 00:09:20,640
Say thank you.

145
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:22,284
Thank you, madam.

146
00:09:24,885 --> 00:09:26,899
Jyoti, how are your rehearsals going?

147
00:09:27,073 --> 00:09:28,661
Rocking, sis.

148
00:09:31,127 --> 00:09:32,482
Good. Shall we?

149
00:09:33,686 --> 00:09:35,856
Your medicine.

150
00:09:36,931 --> 00:09:38,105
What’s this?

151
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,142
The other day you were saying...

152
00:09:40,222 --> 00:09:42,014
your knees have been paining?

153
00:09:42,213 --> 00:09:43,648
You remembered?

154
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,091
And this miraculous medicine...

155
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:48,034
is prepared by a
physician in our Jaipur.

156
00:09:48,114 --> 00:09:49,346
Just apply it day and night...

157
00:09:49,426 --> 00:09:51,289
and the pain will disappear.

158
00:09:51,931 --> 00:09:55,966
- Try it...
- But how much for this medicine?

159
00:09:56,686 --> 00:10:02,133
O Pushpa, I’ll tell you...
once you get some relief.

160
00:10:02,387 --> 00:10:03,241
And let’s go.

161
00:10:03,321 --> 00:10:06,453
Or else you’ll miss your 3:30 Local.

162
00:10:06,533 --> 00:10:07,343
Let’s go.

163
00:10:08,352 --> 00:10:09,140
So tell me.

164
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,478
- Bye, ma’am.
- Bye.

165
00:10:10,719 --> 00:10:13,022
- Do you imitate me as well?
- You?

166
00:10:13,171 --> 00:10:13,798
Never!

167
00:10:13,878 --> 00:10:15,291
- Never.
- Don’t lie.

168
00:10:15,424 --> 00:10:16,221
- No.
- Show me.

169
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,540
- No, no..
- Show me.

170
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,405
- Will you hit me?
- No.

171
00:10:20,485 --> 00:10:21,441
Promise?

172
00:10:22,592 --> 00:10:23,494
Bye.

173
00:10:24,141 --> 00:10:27,557
So children,
I’ll teach you Algebra today.

174
00:10:27,873 --> 00:10:33,160
- (x+y)2 = x2+y2+...
- Come on.

175
00:10:57,259 --> 00:10:58,093
Here you go.

176
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,131
Here.

177
00:11:06,702 --> 00:11:07,610
- Stop.
- Sorry, papa.

178
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,510
- Sorry, papa. Sorry.
- Stop running. Stop.

179
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,363
- Papa, sorry.
- Why are you hitting him?

180
00:11:11,443 --> 00:11:13,362
He’s failed his exams. I’ll...

181
00:11:13,872 --> 00:11:15,564
Will he pass if you hit him?

182
00:11:15,644 --> 00:11:17,609
Son, why don’t you study?

183
00:11:17,689 --> 00:11:18,769
I do, aunty.

184
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:20,403
I passed all subjects.

185
00:11:20,544 --> 00:11:23,285
But maths seems a bit difficult.

186
00:11:23,437 --> 00:11:25,238
And papa doesn’t send
me to extra classes.

187
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:27,169
I drive a taxi all day...

188
00:11:27,249 --> 00:11:28,907
and only then can I pay your fee.

189
00:11:29,053 --> 00:11:30,771
He’s been studying
in an English school...

190
00:11:30,851 --> 00:11:32,268
so that he can
be someone successful.

191
00:11:32,348 --> 00:11:33,875
And not drive a taxi like his father.

192
00:11:33,955 --> 00:11:35,439
- And he wants extra...
- Stop.

193
00:11:35,603 --> 00:11:36,913
I will tutor him.

194
00:11:37,955 --> 00:11:40,275
- Who are you?
- I am a teacher.

195
00:11:40,664 --> 00:11:42,626
I stay in that Sai Sadan building.

196
00:11:42,706 --> 00:11:43,927
Room. 203.

197
00:11:44,251 --> 00:11:46,687
Send him to me at 7pm.

198
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,295
Will you tutor him for free?

199
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,610
You’ll take fee as well.

200
00:11:51,262 --> 00:11:52,622
My fee will be...

201
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,119
that you’ll never
hit your kids again.

202
00:11:55,199 --> 00:11:56,336
Understand.

203
00:11:58,458 --> 00:11:59,990
- All fine, Swati.
- Yes.

204
00:12:01,266 --> 00:12:03,466
- Hello, sir.
- You’re back.

205
00:12:04,213 --> 00:12:06,228
I’ve thought of really great moves...

206
00:12:06,378 --> 00:12:08,277
This time you will surely lose.

207
00:12:08,357 --> 00:12:09,644
Is that so?

208
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,497
So then you reset the game...

209
00:12:11,577 --> 00:12:13,642
- and I’ll freshen up.
- Of course.

210
00:12:53,567 --> 00:12:54,544
Father.

211
00:12:56,411 --> 00:12:58,649
This year’s CA result is only 7%.

212
00:12:58,729 --> 00:13:01,051
And two years later
are my exams as well.

213
00:13:01,298 --> 00:13:03,539
- Now?
- I am not worried.

214
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,291
Two years later,
there will be a board...

215
00:13:06,371 --> 00:13:08,623
hanging outside
my daughter’s office.

216
00:13:08,917 --> 00:13:11,892
‘Shilpa Manohar Sawant.
Chartered Accountant.’

217
00:13:12,093 --> 00:13:13,206
Is that so?

218
00:13:13,442 --> 00:13:14,210
Done.

219
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:17,343
On that note,
how about another round of tea?

220
00:13:17,611 --> 00:13:18,737
Of course.

221
00:13:19,081 --> 00:13:20,532
I’ll make it right away.

222
00:13:20,703 --> 00:13:23,619
But... careful, papa.

223
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,955
Mom’s going to capture
your queen again.

224
00:13:26,035 --> 00:13:27,300
I’ll smack you.

225
00:13:29,145 --> 00:13:30,278
Thank you.

226
00:13:31,347 --> 00:13:33,307
Here, give this to
your class students.

227
00:13:33,477 --> 00:13:34,652
Them too.

228
00:13:36,601 --> 00:13:39,001
Akhilesh. Come here, son.

229
00:13:46,466 --> 00:13:51,527
Look, this question from
the Quadratic Equations...

230
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:53,987
The sum of 2 numbers is 125...

231
00:14:18,661 --> 00:14:19,573
Sunil.

232
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:23,775
Thakurji... get up.

233
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:25,755
Come on... Get up.

234
00:14:34,178 --> 00:14:34,964
Jyoti!

235
00:14:36,674 --> 00:14:37,617
Jyoti!

236
00:14:41,363 --> 00:14:43,486
I am up, alright.

237
00:14:45,045 --> 00:14:46,756
- Sunil.
- Sorry. Sorry.

238
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:48,480
Always with the laptop.

239
00:14:48,619 --> 00:14:51,721
Listen, you’ll have to
drop Rahul at playschool today.

240
00:14:51,961 --> 00:14:53,755
I’ve to get ready
and leave early today.

241
00:14:53,835 --> 00:14:56,420
It’s our school’s Annual Day
and I’ve to pickup Vidya as well.

242
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:49,362
Good morning, ma’am.

243
00:15:52,643 --> 00:15:54,198
What is this, Ms. Gupta?

244
00:15:54,558 --> 00:15:57,132
I changed the teacher’s
reporting time to 10am.

245
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,544
And yet they all arrived at 8? Why?

246
00:16:00,203 --> 00:16:01,717
I want an explanation.

247
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,774
Didn’t you inform them.

248
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,389
I am asking you something?

249
00:16:10,447 --> 00:16:11,463
I forgot.

250
00:16:12,876 --> 00:16:14,686
- Forgot...
- Good morning, ma’am.

251
00:16:17,611 --> 00:16:18,665
What about her?

252
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:21,272
You didn’t forget to inform her.

253
00:16:22,488 --> 00:16:23,595
Look, Ms. Gupta.

254
00:16:24,444 --> 00:16:28,567
Don’t ever try to
ignore any of my orders.

255
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:31,086
Consider it as a last warning.

256
00:16:31,577 --> 00:16:32,512
Yes, ma’am.

257
00:16:39,263 --> 00:16:40,193
Yes, ma’am!

258
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:23,570

259
00:17:25,568 --> 00:17:27,868

287
00:20:16,694 --> 00:20:18,261
Now, moving forward...

288
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,922
we would request
our guest of honour...

289
00:20:21,002 --> 00:20:23,739
Mr. Anmol Parekh
to come on the stage...

290
00:20:23,894 --> 00:20:25,530
and say a few words.

291
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:27,976
Are you serious?

292
00:20:39,025 --> 00:20:39,802
Thank you.

293
00:20:40,182 --> 00:20:42,844
Respected Principal and Trustees.

294
00:20:43,044 --> 00:20:43,719
Thank you.

295
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:45,009
Thank you for this honour.

296
00:20:45,089 --> 00:20:46,188
I am humbled.

297
00:20:48,474 --> 00:20:50,841
Everyone’s performance
was really nice.

298
00:20:51,175 --> 00:20:54,248
I am really happy to see and know...

299
00:20:54,328 --> 00:20:58,483
that the students of our school...

300
00:20:59,001 --> 00:21:01,742
are so bright and so much talented.

301
00:21:01,938 --> 00:21:03,896
And the best program
of the day was the dance show.

302
00:21:03,976 --> 00:21:06,556
Brilliant concept
and superb composition.

303
00:21:06,686 --> 00:21:10,012
And now I would like
to congratulate the teacher...

304
00:21:10,306 --> 00:21:14,384
who worked so hard
to prepare this show.

305
00:21:14,639 --> 00:21:16,782
Ms. Kamini Gupta.

306
00:21:52,888 --> 00:21:54,085
Good morning, ma’am.

307
00:21:58,670 --> 00:21:59,494
Sir...

308
00:21:59,978 --> 00:22:01,185
Principal ma’am is here to see you.

309
00:22:03,135 --> 00:22:05,253
Hi. May I come in?

310
00:22:05,749 --> 00:22:06,818
Oh yes, please.

311
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:10,725
Please, Please, Please...
Welcome by all means.

312
00:22:10,805 --> 00:22:14,264
Welcome, Welcome...
it’s a great pleasure...

313
00:22:14,424 --> 00:22:17,969
to welcome the new
principal of Kanta Ben.

314
00:22:18,474 --> 00:22:19,464
Thank you, Anmol.

315
00:22:19,721 --> 00:22:20,532
This is the limit.

316
00:22:20,612 --> 00:22:22,732
They fired such a
wonderful Principal...

317
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:24,644
and appointed
that Gupta in her place.

318
00:22:24,963 --> 00:22:26,965
And no one objected it.

319
00:22:27,175 --> 00:22:28,969
Some people took objection...

320
00:22:29,508 --> 00:22:32,211
favouring Mrs. Shashtri.

321
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:36,493
But finally... the entire
Management had to agree.

322
00:22:39,033 --> 00:22:41,420
But how did Gupta manage
to pull this trick?

323
00:22:42,523 --> 00:22:44,060
It’s really simple, Vidya ma’am.

324
00:22:44,184 --> 00:22:46,137
Through Anmol Parekh.

325
00:22:46,263 --> 00:22:48,853
But how did she get
the upper hand on him.

326
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:51,762
What did Gupta have to offer?

327
00:22:53,694 --> 00:22:55,101
This is Naresh Patel.

328
00:22:55,622 --> 00:22:57,208
Chairman of DGM School.

329
00:22:58,342 --> 00:23:01,615
His school is just one
kilometre away from Kanta Ben.

330
00:23:02,226 --> 00:23:05,613
But only celebrities and
VIP’s children study in his school.

331
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,745
And their drivers and servants
kids study in our school.

332
00:23:10,241 --> 00:23:11,560
Do you know why?

333
00:23:12,135 --> 00:23:15,753
Because Mrs. Shashtri grants
admission to just anyone.

334
00:23:17,185 --> 00:23:18,892
But I am going to change all that.

335
00:23:19,622 --> 00:23:21,414
I am going to make sure that...

336
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:23,377
Kanta Ben becomes the
school for the rich and famous.

337
00:23:23,457 --> 00:23:24,586
And No.1.

338
00:23:25,697 --> 00:23:29,116
I want my school
to be No.1 in this area.

339
00:23:30,138 --> 00:23:31,445
I promised you that.

340
00:23:31,949 --> 00:23:33,902
And for that
I’ll make few changes.

341
00:23:34,537 --> 00:23:35,553
To begin with...

342
00:23:36,647 --> 00:23:38,915
from this session,
I’ll be hiking the school fee.

343
00:23:39,756 --> 00:23:42,513
- What? Tea money?
- Yes.

344
00:23:42,762 --> 00:23:44,600
Sir said get money for the tea.

345
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,638
- Seven rupees for a cup of tea.
- Have you lost your mind?

346
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:50,003
New Principal, New Rules!

347
00:23:50,892 --> 00:23:53,935
Earlier our tea was complimentary
on behalf of the school.

348
00:23:54,222 --> 00:23:57,269
Now the new Principal
must have refused to pay.

349
00:23:57,472 --> 00:24:01,028
So that canteen guy
won’t pay from his pocket.

350
00:24:01,966 --> 00:24:03,879
We must improve the
teaching standards.

351
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,677
We need upmarket teachers.

352
00:24:05,809 --> 00:24:06,832
Okay.

353
00:24:06,964 --> 00:24:08,235
Tell me more.

354
00:24:08,674 --> 00:24:10,695
There are some teachers
in our school...

355
00:24:10,775 --> 00:24:13,146
who are over-aged and over-paid.

356
00:24:14,315 --> 00:24:16,475
Without them,
we can afford three teachers...

357
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:17,724
in their salary.

358
00:24:17,927 --> 00:24:20,367
Young, pretty, smart.

359
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:22,733
And our school will
get an international look.

360
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,018
Then fire them.

361
00:24:24,098 --> 00:24:28,034
All these old teachers,
throw them out of my school.

362
00:24:28,189 --> 00:24:29,439
Throw them out.

363
00:24:30,596 --> 00:24:32,111
We won’t fire them, Anmol.

364
00:24:32,324 --> 00:24:33,865
They’ve been working
here for a pretty long time.

365
00:24:34,004 --> 00:24:35,365
It will raise many issues.

366
00:24:38,814 --> 00:24:40,684
What if they quit themselves?

367
00:24:44,225 --> 00:24:46,513
Fine. You can do as you want.

368
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:48,072
I won’t interfere.

369
00:24:48,288 --> 00:24:50,332
Just make my school No.1.

370
00:24:50,598 --> 00:24:51,266
And...

371
00:24:53,042 --> 00:24:55,686
I’ll make you one
of the Directors here.

372
00:25:02,455 --> 00:25:04,633
Come, Sis... I’ll drop you home today.

373
00:25:04,814 --> 00:25:06,648
- Thank you.
- You will all have to wait.

374
00:25:06,728 --> 00:25:08,831
Because Gupta madam’s
called for a meeting.

375
00:25:10,154 --> 00:25:11,009
Meeting?

376
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:13,108
At this hour?

377
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:48,937
Here...

378
00:25:49,164 --> 00:25:52,919
Drink this hot cup of tea
and calm your mind.

379
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:58,179
Thakurayin, how does it matter?

380
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:00,229
Whether the management appoints
Hitler as the Principal...

381
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:01,496
or Saddam Hussain.

382
00:26:01,576 --> 00:26:02,718
What do we care?

383
00:26:02,954 --> 00:26:05,422
Look, our life is really simple.

384
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:07,949
Just like a computer CPU.

385
00:26:08,171 --> 00:26:10,265
I am the Hard Disk,
you’re the Mother Board...

386
00:26:10,398 --> 00:26:12,378
and our Rahul is the Processor.

387
00:26:12,639 --> 00:26:15,076
And your job’s like a RAM.

388
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,979
As long as it’s working, it’s okay.

389
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:19,392
When it goes bad, we’ll change it.

390
00:26:19,596 --> 00:26:23,537
So... switch on the Refresh
button of your mind.

391
00:26:23,908 --> 00:26:25,823
Finish your tea... and we’ll go out.

392
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,093
Right, Thakurayin.

393
00:26:27,573 --> 00:26:30,236
That’s more like it.
Come on.

394
00:27:02,646 --> 00:27:05,266
<i>“O Life...”</i>

395
00:27:06,589 --> 00:27:11,960
<i>“Our friendship is pretty old”</i>

396
00:27:12,429 --> 00:27:17,897
<i>“Your story is like
the sun and shade”</i>

397
00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:26,980
<i>“Your eyes... filled
with hopes and expectations”</i>

398
00:27:28,344 --> 00:27:30,154
<i>“Sometimes it’s empty and...”</i>

399
00:27:30,234 --> 00:27:32,927
<i>“sometimes filled to the brink”</i>

400
00:27:34,605 --> 00:27:38,285
<i>“Sometimes it becomes a stranger”</i>

401
00:27:38,511 --> 00:27:42,149
<i>“Sometimes it gets upset
and becomes friends again”</i>

402
00:27:42,315 --> 00:27:45,681
<i>“This life...”</i>

403
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:48,911
<i>“O Life...”</i>

404
00:27:50,267 --> 00:27:54,820
<i>“Our friendship is pretty old”</i>

405
00:27:55,957 --> 00:28:00,091
<i>“Your story is like
the sun and shade”</i>

406
00:28:23,888 --> 00:28:27,759
<i>“Some images from my dreams”</i>

407
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:31,744
<i>“Some unseen shackles holding me”</i>

408
00:28:31,973 --> 00:28:36,894
<i>“Some incomplete conversations”</i>

409
00:28:37,797 --> 00:28:41,788
<i>“Some pretty and happy memories”</i>

410
00:28:41,999 --> 00:28:45,656
<i>“Some silent... prayers”</i>

411
00:28:45,897 --> 00:28:50,064
<i>“Some... sweet days and faded nights”</i>

412
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:55,301
<i>“All the past and the future moments”</i>

413
00:28:55,481 --> 00:28:59,175
<i>“Walk with you holding your hands”</i>

414
00:28:59,334 --> 00:29:01,784
<i>“This life...”</i>

415
00:29:03,643 --> 00:29:05,502
<i>“O Life...”</i>

416
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:24,936
Naresh bhai, I spoke to you about...

417
00:29:25,016 --> 00:29:27,969
TV actor Jai Kapoor
son’s admission in DGM school.

418
00:29:28,049 --> 00:29:29,347
Oh yeah...

419
00:29:31,783 --> 00:29:33,914
Introduce him to Principal Rao.

420
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,824
Okay.

421
00:29:34,904 --> 00:29:36,989
- And the boy better be good, huh!
- Of course.

422
00:29:37,069 --> 00:29:39,431
- You know merit works in our school.
- Yeah.

423
00:29:40,461 --> 00:29:42,591
- Are you planning for dramatics?
- Yeah, I am trying.

424
00:29:42,671 --> 00:29:43,644
- Mr. Naresh.
- Let’s see.

425
00:29:43,821 --> 00:29:44,883
Hi, Dhiren.

426
00:29:45,032 --> 00:29:47,154
- I am good, how are you?
- Just fine.

427
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:48,459
Mansukh’s son.

428
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:50,893
- Hello, sir.
- Hi, how are you?

429
00:29:51,023 --> 00:29:52,454
- Very good, sir.
- Nice to see you.

430
00:29:52,534 --> 00:29:55,102
- He did his MBA from London.
- Fantastic!

431
00:29:55,182 --> 00:29:56,812
Now what’s the business plan in India?

432
00:29:56,892 --> 00:29:57,946
Education, sir.

433
00:29:58,417 --> 00:30:00,070
You know it’s the best
business in this country.

434
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:03,244
And by the way, sir,
even we have a school.

435
00:30:03,397 --> 00:30:05,235
Obviously, not as big as yours.

436
00:30:05,549 --> 00:30:08,719
Your DGM school is no.1 in this area.

437
00:30:09,379 --> 00:30:12,044
I... I feel really jealous.

438
00:30:12,748 --> 00:30:13,873
Mr. Anmol.

439
00:30:14,054 --> 00:30:15,403
Not just in this area...

440
00:30:15,635 --> 00:30:18,490
his DGM schools are
best in the entire state.

441
00:30:18,648 --> 00:30:20,313
Yeah, of course. I do agree.

442
00:30:20,692 --> 00:30:24,002
Sir, I am striving
to make my school...

443
00:30:24,174 --> 00:30:26,133
much more famous than yours.

444
00:30:26,213 --> 00:30:28,103
- I like your confidence.
- Of course, sir.

445
00:30:28,276 --> 00:30:29,183
I will do it.

446
00:30:29,655 --> 00:30:31,281
And you will see I will do it, sir.

447
00:30:31,853 --> 00:30:36,015
Good. All the best.
But keep education as education.

448
00:30:36,348 --> 00:30:38,442
- Not as business.
- Yeah, sir.

449
00:30:38,734 --> 00:30:40,160
- All the best.
- Thank you.

450
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:44,072
Good morning, sir.

451
00:30:44,152 --> 00:30:46,273
Good morning, children.
Settle down fast.

452
00:30:46,441 --> 00:30:47,999
Thank you, madam.

453
00:30:48,428 --> 00:30:50,903
Good morning, madam.

454
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:53,011
Good morning.

455
00:30:53,446 --> 00:30:55,168
Thank you, madam.

456
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:06,943
Madam...

457
00:31:07,023 --> 00:31:08,952
- Shankar. Shankar. - Our chairs
are missing from the classroom.

458
00:31:09,032 --> 00:31:10,345
No chairs in our class either.

459
00:31:10,425 --> 00:31:11,524
Mine either.

460
00:31:11,604 --> 00:31:12,791
- No chair in the classroom.
- Santosh.

461
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:13,970
What’s going on?

462
00:31:16,655 --> 00:31:18,608
What’s going on?
What’s this meeting about?

463
00:31:18,728 --> 00:31:20,206
Go back to your classes.

464
00:31:20,286 --> 00:31:22,046
There are no chairs in the classroom.

465
00:31:22,185 --> 00:31:23,872
Principal ma’am had them taken out.

466
00:31:24,018 --> 00:31:26,706
She says, if you tutor
the children while standing...

467
00:31:26,825 --> 00:31:28,189
it creates discipline.

468
00:31:28,269 --> 00:31:29,881
And the children stay alert.

469
00:31:30,095 --> 00:31:31,621
But we do teach on our while standing.

470
00:31:31,701 --> 00:31:33,074
Then why do you need chairs?

471
00:31:33,154 --> 00:31:34,632
But ma’am,
we need to take attendance...

472
00:31:34,779 --> 00:31:37,307
No arguments.
Go to your classes.

473
00:31:37,948 --> 00:31:40,363
- But...
- I said go to your classes.

474
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:41,850
Surprising!

475
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:50,690
- Roll no.1.
- Present Miss.

476
00:31:51,008 --> 00:31:52,701
- Roll no.2.
- Present Miss.

477
00:31:53,436 --> 00:31:55,526
- Roll no.3.
- Present Miss.

478
00:31:58,481 --> 00:32:02,259
New infrastructure,
air-conditioned classes...

479
00:32:02,605 --> 00:32:06,424
with smart-board and cameras,
international board...

480
00:32:07,033 --> 00:32:12,220
new library, new laboratories,
swimming pool.

481
00:32:15,158 --> 00:32:16,428
Tennis court...

482
00:32:17,732 --> 00:32:19,700
And many more projects.

483
00:32:21,927 --> 00:32:25,243
Respected members of the
parents-teachers association.

484
00:32:27,274 --> 00:32:30,518
This is how Kanta Ben school
will look in the coming years.

485
00:32:31,426 --> 00:32:33,097
And you’ll be glad to know...

486
00:32:33,507 --> 00:32:35,965
that the Management
has already given their approval.

487
00:32:37,105 --> 00:32:40,033
But... there are some issues...

488
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:45,406
...where I’ll need your help.

489
00:32:46,275 --> 00:32:48,041
And then our school will be no. 1.

490
00:32:48,262 --> 00:32:50,616
Madam, anything you say.

491
00:33:04,055 --> 00:33:08,193
Orographic rains.

492
00:33:21,273 --> 00:33:23,530
Pinto ma’am. You’ve a proxy.

493
00:33:24,153 --> 00:33:25,638
Proxy? Whose?

494
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:27,030
Rupa madam.

495
00:33:27,223 --> 00:33:28,841
Please take up class in 8B.

496
00:33:29,013 --> 00:33:31,920
Because Rupa madam is busy with
the Principal in a urgent meeting.

497
00:33:32,894 --> 00:33:34,469
Look, ma’am.

498
00:33:35,336 --> 00:33:36,235
Next.

499
00:33:36,388 --> 00:33:38,325
And look at this.
The embroidery...

500
00:33:40,999 --> 00:33:42,186
And look at this.

501
00:33:42,266 --> 00:33:43,860
- How’s this?
- Nice.

502
00:33:43,993 --> 00:33:45,613
- Show me something else.
- Yes.

503
00:33:45,751 --> 00:33:49,781
The Equator is a line
running through the earth...

504
00:34:05,374 --> 00:34:07,172
Write properly.

505
00:34:11,451 --> 00:34:12,579
Here you go.

506
00:34:17,754 --> 00:34:18,870
Nusrat madam.

507
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:21,775
Mr. Sharma from Accounts
has sent this for you.

508
00:34:43,736 --> 00:34:44,463
Madam...

509
00:34:45,622 --> 00:34:48,088
I just received a notice.

510
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:53,244
It states that I haven’t paid
my son Iqbal’s fee.

511
00:34:53,747 --> 00:34:57,113
But... his fee was exempted...

512
00:34:57,665 --> 00:34:59,569
because I teach here.

513
00:34:59,763 --> 00:35:01,723
And teachers get an exemption.

514
00:35:01,888 --> 00:35:04,896
They did... but you’ll have
to pay the fee from this year.

515
00:35:05,795 --> 00:35:09,428
But madam... how can I do it?

516
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:12,836
The school has even hiked the fee.

517
00:35:13,877 --> 00:35:18,056
And you know...
that Iqbal’s father is dead.

518
00:35:21,128 --> 00:35:24,062
Then... how can I alone...

519
00:35:24,918 --> 00:35:27,679
So... what’s the big deal?

520
00:35:29,621 --> 00:35:30,910
I am single too.

521
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,415
You see Nusrat.

522
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:37,201
This Single status...
only looks nice on Matrimonial sites.

523
00:35:37,887 --> 00:35:39,692
Not in management decisions.

524
00:35:41,176 --> 00:35:42,261
Not applicable.

525
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,916
You may go now.

526
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:45,667
But, ma’am.

527
00:35:45,794 --> 00:35:47,011
Leave now.

528
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,886
Loser!

529
00:36:02,038 --> 00:36:04,269
Page 22... chapter 5.

530
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:10,010
Class... open your books.

531
00:37:41,689 --> 00:37:42,671
Oh, God!

532
00:37:46,643 --> 00:37:47,803
Laxmi.

533
00:37:48,644 --> 00:37:50,061
Laxmi, muster.

534
00:37:50,241 --> 00:37:52,125
Shankar just took it to Rupa madam.

535
00:37:52,205 --> 00:37:53,378
Shankar.

536
00:38:02,643 --> 00:38:03,689
Shankar.

537
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:06,473
Shankar.

538
00:38:07,066 --> 00:38:09,026
Madam, here you go.

539
00:38:13,053 --> 00:38:15,486
Sorry. There was a
traffic jam on the road.

540
00:38:15,566 --> 00:38:16,885
I am 4 minutes late.

541
00:38:18,041 --> 00:38:20,737
You should’ve started 4
minutes early from home, Manjeet.

542
00:38:21,208 --> 00:38:23,223
I left home at right time, Rupa.

543
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:24,507
- But...
- Hey...

544
00:38:25,034 --> 00:38:25,938
Madam.

545
00:38:26,606 --> 00:38:28,147
Call me madam.

546
00:38:30,924 --> 00:38:33,302
Madam, please.

547
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:38,298
No, Manjeet.
You’ll definitely get a red mark.

548
00:38:38,869 --> 00:38:41,155
You should learn to be disciplined.

549
00:38:51,003 --> 00:38:52,948
You’ll teach me discipline!

550
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:56,415
You’ll teach me discipline!

551
00:38:56,551 --> 00:38:58,690
First learn some manners from me.

552
00:38:58,848 --> 00:39:02,037
“No Manjeet... you’ll definitely
get a red mark.” Huh!

553
00:39:02,244 --> 00:39:06,470
Now I’ll slap you until
your cheeks turn red.

554
00:39:06,774 --> 00:39:08,253
2nd Red mark.

555
00:39:08,574 --> 00:39:09,876
3rd Red mark.

556
00:39:10,009 --> 00:39:11,824
4th Red mark.

557
00:39:12,622 --> 00:39:14,887
- Call me madam.
- Sorry.

558
00:39:15,042 --> 00:39:16,719
Bloody madam...

559
00:39:17,012 --> 00:39:20,367
You look like a toad.

560
00:39:20,654 --> 00:39:22,497
Call me madam.

561
00:39:22,669 --> 00:39:26,484
I’ll make you a madam.

562
00:39:27,138 --> 00:39:28,625
I’ll make you madam.

563
00:39:28,705 --> 00:39:29,776
Madam.

564
00:39:33,667 --> 00:39:35,040
Madam!

565
00:39:37,695 --> 00:39:39,258
How was it, madam?

566
00:39:39,562 --> 00:39:41,195
You did the right thing?

567
00:39:42,081 --> 00:39:43,315
Madam!

568
00:39:48,378 --> 00:39:49,424
Manjeet.

569
00:39:50,033 --> 00:39:51,007
Manjeet.

570
00:39:51,267 --> 00:39:52,513
Manjeet!

571
00:39:54,557 --> 00:39:56,028
Why are you laughing?

572
00:39:57,585 --> 00:40:00,193
I was only practising
to call you madam.

573
00:40:00,604 --> 00:40:01,783
Madam.

574
00:40:03,915 --> 00:40:06,073
- It’s okay.
- Thank you...

575
00:40:06,733 --> 00:40:07,679
Madam.

576
00:40:13,592 --> 00:40:15,350
I haven’t seen Nusrat today.

577
00:40:15,566 --> 00:40:18,937
She’s getting Iqbal admitted
in a different school.

578
00:40:19,678 --> 00:40:21,355
It is so unfair.

579
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:25,313
We tutor others kids as our own.

580
00:40:25,728 --> 00:40:28,952
And our kids have to
study in a different school.

581
00:40:31,409 --> 00:40:33,176
Have you seen the new time-table?

582
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,132
My subjects have been increased.

583
00:40:35,212 --> 00:40:36,829
They gave me Hindi as well.

584
00:40:36,961 --> 00:40:38,126
How’s that?

585
00:40:38,414 --> 00:40:40,041
You’re an Arts and Crafts teacher.

586
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:41,601
If you teach Hindi...

587
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,815
what will Mr. Chaturvedi teach?

588
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:49,518
What nonsense.

589
00:40:49,848 --> 00:40:51,662
A highly qualified Hindi teacher...

590
00:40:51,844 --> 00:40:53,500
turned into a PT instructor.

591
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,152
Why is Gupta doing this?

592
00:40:55,232 --> 00:40:56,847
I think this is the preparation...

593
00:40:56,927 --> 00:40:58,450
for Mr. Chaturvedi’s farewell.

594
00:40:58,618 --> 00:41:00,536
Farewell? Where’s he going?

595
00:41:00,663 --> 00:41:02,555
He isn’t, he’s being fired.

596
00:41:02,635 --> 00:41:04,996
Mr. Chaturvedi is
Gupta’s first target.

597
00:41:05,151 --> 00:41:06,487
Meaning?

598
00:41:06,691 --> 00:41:08,750
It means... he’s been given
‘Physical Training'...

599
00:41:08,898 --> 00:41:11,027
and he isn’t physically fit for it.

600
00:41:11,318 --> 00:41:12,696
Poor Mr. Chaturvedi...

601
00:41:12,776 --> 00:41:16,549
will soon grow tired,
give up and quit his job.

602
00:41:16,814 --> 00:41:18,607
Or fired as surplus.

603
00:42:54,147 --> 00:42:56,742
- Shilpa.
- Coming, mom.

604
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:10,360
Water. Drink some water.

605
00:43:13,922 --> 00:43:15,347
Are you not well.

606
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:24,425
Mom, why are your feet swollen?

607
00:43:24,606 --> 00:43:27,263
I’ll get some hot water.

608
00:43:27,478 --> 00:43:28,467
I’ll be right back.

609
00:43:33,525 --> 00:43:34,957
Is it too hot?

610
00:43:40,937 --> 00:43:44,043
Stop it, mom.
How much more are you going to work?

611
00:43:44,389 --> 00:43:46,437
You’ve done enough.
Take some rest now.

612
00:43:46,618 --> 00:43:48,246
Only until you finish your CA.

613
00:43:48,326 --> 00:43:49,425
Just two more years.

614
00:43:50,188 --> 00:43:53,144
Then you can earn, and we’ll rest.

615
00:43:54,125 --> 00:43:56,250
She’s never going to rest.

616
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,752
She’ll always be doing social service.

617
00:43:59,739 --> 00:44:01,263
Even if she quits her job...

618
00:44:01,386 --> 00:44:03,977
she’ll still keep
tutoring her needy students.

619
00:44:04,057 --> 00:44:04,946
- That's all.
-  Yes.

620
00:44:05,026 --> 00:44:06,277
But not today, mom.

621
00:44:06,457 --> 00:44:08,020
I’ll send the kids back today.

622
00:44:08,148 --> 00:44:10,251
No, Shilpa.
Their exams are close-by.

623
00:44:10,412 --> 00:44:11,399
Only for a little while.

624
00:44:11,479 --> 00:44:13,346
They will pass with goods marks, dear.

625
00:44:13,462 --> 00:44:16,309
And what if they do
pass with flying colours?

626
00:44:17,283 --> 00:44:19,511
Then... I’ll get the same happiness...

627
00:44:19,591 --> 00:44:21,898
that Ramakant Acharekar did when...

628
00:44:21,978 --> 00:44:24,494
Sachin Tendulkar
would hit a century.

629
00:44:25,158 --> 00:44:26,137
See.

630
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:08,892
It's 99, mom.

631
00:45:09,349 --> 00:45:12,086
Take a leave from
school and rest at home.

632
00:45:12,306 --> 00:45:14,326
Otherwise your fever will get worse.

633
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:16,699
No... 99 not out.

634
00:45:17,027 --> 00:45:19,308
I would’ve taken
a leave if it was 100.

635
00:45:19,954 --> 00:45:22,952
Just give me a pill for the fever.

636
00:45:23,314 --> 00:45:25,533
- And watch me bat again.
- Mom!

637
00:45:25,713 --> 00:45:28,889
See... Litmus paper turns... blue!

638
00:45:29,122 --> 00:45:31,590
- This means the solution is a...
- Base.

639
00:45:31,779 --> 00:45:34,209
If it was acidic, then the
colour would turn too...

640
00:45:34,289 --> 00:45:34,974
Red.

641
00:45:35,054 --> 00:45:35,709
Very good.

642
00:45:35,789 --> 00:45:40,142
I’ll give you the easiest
formula... to learn Trigonometry.

643
00:45:40,681 --> 00:45:47,116
“Pandit Badri Prasad
Hari Hari Bol... Sona Chandi Tol”

644
00:45:47,284 --> 00:45:48,312
Okay.

645
00:45:48,542 --> 00:45:49,737
So that’s...

646
00:45:50,367 --> 00:45:54,591
“Pandit Badri Prasad...”

647
00:45:55,568 --> 00:45:59,665
"Hari Hari Bol..."

648
00:45:59,871 --> 00:46:02,444
"Sona Chandi Tol.”

649
00:46:02,864 --> 00:46:05,217
P for... Perpendicular.

650
00:46:05,423 --> 00:46:08,598
- B for Badri... B for...
- Base.

651
00:46:08,863 --> 00:46:12,002
- H for Hari... H for...
- Hypotenuse.

652
00:46:12,143 --> 00:46:13,121
That’s right.

653
00:46:13,302 --> 00:46:15,684
“Sona Chandi Tol.”

654
00:46:16,046 --> 00:46:18,183
Sine Cos Tan.

655
00:46:19,387 --> 00:46:21,317
P/B.

656
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:24,616
Now copy all this in your notebook.

657
00:46:24,784 --> 00:46:25,603
Okay.

658
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,677
Okay.

659
00:46:59,295 --> 00:47:01,946
Good morning madam.

660
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:03,675
Sit down.

661
00:47:03,903 --> 00:47:05,972
Thank you, madam.

662
00:47:07,113 --> 00:47:08,449
Vidya ma’am.

663
00:47:13,895 --> 00:47:15,403
You should be ashamed.

664
00:47:16,182 --> 00:47:18,073
You were sleeping
on the children’s seat.

665
00:47:18,211 --> 00:47:19,938
I wasn’t sleeping, Rupa.

666
00:47:20,072 --> 00:47:21,285
I wrote down the notes...

667
00:47:21,365 --> 00:47:22,684
and the children were copying them.

668
00:47:22,764 --> 00:47:25,685
I see... did you check
whether they’re copying or not?

669
00:47:25,765 --> 00:47:27,059
Or you didn’t think it was necessary.

670
00:47:27,139 --> 00:47:28,215
I do check.

671
00:47:28,295 --> 00:47:30,548
You weren’t checking,
you were sleeping.

672
00:47:30,793 --> 00:47:33,457
I wasn’t sleeping,
why are you creating a scene.

673
00:47:33,586 --> 00:47:35,216
I am creating a scene?

674
00:47:35,725 --> 00:47:37,487
This is the way you
talk to your supervisor?

675
00:47:37,567 --> 00:47:39,613
- But you can’t just go on...
- What’s going on?

676
00:47:39,831 --> 00:47:41,115
See, ma’am.

677
00:47:41,451 --> 00:47:43,116
She was sleeping
on the children’s seat.

678
00:47:43,294 --> 00:47:44,568
When I asked for an explanation...

679
00:47:44,648 --> 00:47:46,060
she is arguing with me.

680
00:47:46,221 --> 00:47:49,115
- I wasn’t arguing, I was just...
- Now you’re arguing with me.

681
00:47:49,235 --> 00:47:52,078
I am not arguing,
I was only telling her what happened.

682
00:47:52,653 --> 00:47:54,385
Actually... I am not well.

683
00:47:54,576 --> 00:47:56,077
I have fever and I
couldn’t stand properly...

684
00:47:56,157 --> 00:47:57,883
If you’ve fever please sit at home.

685
00:47:58,450 --> 00:48:00,544
Why take the trouble
of coming to school?

686
00:48:01,191 --> 00:48:02,975
You simply wrote some
questions on the blackboard.

687
00:48:03,178 --> 00:48:04,505
But not a clue whether the
children are noting it down...

688
00:48:04,585 --> 00:48:06,188
or drawing cartoons in their books.

689
00:48:06,366 --> 00:48:08,598
Excuse me... in my class...

690
00:48:08,678 --> 00:48:10,839
children only
study during study time.

691
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:12,707
They don’t draw cartoons.

692
00:48:13,792 --> 00:48:14,859
Excuse me!

693
00:48:17,918 --> 00:48:20,419
Good morning, madam.

694
00:48:21,005 --> 00:48:23,781
- Good morning.
- Thank you, madam.

695
00:48:40,979 --> 00:48:43,038
Let’s have a surprise test.

696
00:48:43,979 --> 00:48:46,315
How many of you know
about Trigonometry?

697
00:48:46,979 --> 00:48:49,116
But this is the first lesson...

698
00:48:49,769 --> 00:48:50,970
Only three hands?

699
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:55,105
You? What’s your name?

700
00:48:58,183 --> 00:48:59,683
Ma’am... Rohan.

701
00:48:59,843 --> 00:49:01,155
Rohan, come here.

702
00:49:04,991 --> 00:49:06,408
Explain Trigonometry.

703
00:49:09,908 --> 00:49:10,736
Come on.

704
00:49:40,338 --> 00:49:44,407
'Pandit Badri Prasad
Hari Hari Bol...'

705
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:46,975
'Sona Chandi Tol.'

706
00:50:08,141 --> 00:50:12,860
'Pandit Badri...'

707
00:50:13,227 --> 00:50:15,379
'Prasad...'

708
00:50:15,974 --> 00:50:20,658
'Hari Hari Bol...'

709
00:50:21,862 --> 00:50:25,383
'Sona Chandi Tol.'

710
00:50:37,364 --> 00:50:38,000
Rupa.

711
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:39,149
Yes, ma’am.

712
00:50:41,879 --> 00:50:42,991
Please come outside.

713
00:50:48,265 --> 00:50:49,492
Unbelievable.

714
00:50:49,657 --> 00:50:51,896
Are you teaching
them maths or Sanskrit?

715
00:50:52,155 --> 00:50:54,993
I’m trying to take this
school to international standards.

716
00:50:55,228 --> 00:50:56,386
And you’re teaching...

717
00:50:56,466 --> 00:50:58,462
“ Pandit Badri Prasad
Hari Hari Bol” in maths class.

718
00:50:58,542 --> 00:51:00,069
- But that’s the simplest formula...
- That’s the most...

719
00:51:00,149 --> 00:51:01,872
outdated formula, ma’am!

720
00:51:02,064 --> 00:51:03,355
Can I make a suggestion?

721
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:05,493
Why don’t you take
voluntary retirement?

722
00:51:05,624 --> 00:51:07,446
Isn’t that what you want?

723
00:51:07,648 --> 00:51:09,432
We all get fed up and quit school.

724
00:51:09,606 --> 00:51:11,904
So you can appoint new
teachers as per your will...

725
00:51:11,984 --> 00:51:13,139
and they can be your sycophants!

726
00:51:13,219 --> 00:51:14,118
How dare you?

727
00:51:14,198 --> 00:51:17,391
- Do you know who you’re talking to?
- Yes, I know and now you listen to me.

728
00:51:17,728 --> 00:51:20,849
It’s our bad luck that you’ve
been appointed as our senior.

729
00:51:20,996 --> 00:51:22,619
Forget about doing
a single good thing.

730
00:51:22,699 --> 00:51:24,075
You only like to assert your power...

731
00:51:24,155 --> 00:51:27,670
because you’re a sadist
and you enjoy torturing teachers.

732
00:51:27,821 --> 00:51:29,871
I haven’t started enjoying yet,
Vidya Sawant.

733
00:51:30,043 --> 00:51:32,067
I’ll really enjoy when
I chuck you out of this school.

734
00:51:32,147 --> 00:51:33,539
I see... is it that easy?

735
00:51:33,677 --> 00:51:34,878
On what grounds?

736
00:51:36,217 --> 00:51:37,832
I don’t give explanations.

737
00:51:37,996 --> 00:51:39,412
I just take actions.

738
00:51:49,579 --> 00:51:50,520
Vidya!

739
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:51,842
Ma’am.

740
00:51:55,355 --> 00:51:56,338
Ma’am.

741
00:52:00,149 --> 00:52:01,332
Have some water, ma’am.

742
00:52:22,449 --> 00:52:24,213
Vidya, are you okay?

743
00:52:32,069 --> 00:52:33,752
Are you okay, sister?

744
00:52:35,053 --> 00:52:36,050
Sister?

745
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:08,052
What happened?

746
00:53:12,142 --> 00:53:13,836
Termination Letter.

747
00:53:15,966 --> 00:53:18,796
Parents complaints
against Vidya ma’am.

748
00:53:20,177 --> 00:53:24,837
Outdated... incapable...
incompetent teacher.

749
00:53:25,231 --> 00:53:27,505
Parent’s complaints.

750
00:53:28,551 --> 00:53:30,355
In writing... against me.

751
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:34,314
Am I incompetent?

752
00:53:34,394 --> 00:53:36,028
No, ma’am.

753
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:38,579
I don’t know how to teach.

754
00:53:38,744 --> 00:53:39,885
This is wrong.

755
00:53:40,024 --> 00:53:41,445
Don’t think like that.

756
00:53:41,586 --> 00:53:42,724
Sister.

757
00:53:42,804 --> 00:53:45,041
Ma’am...
Ma’am...

758
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,445
Sister.

759
00:53:48,253 --> 00:53:49,127
Ma’am...

760
00:53:55,617 --> 00:53:57,855
- See the reaction here...
- Jyoti miss, come quickly.

761
00:53:57,935 --> 00:53:59,477
Something’s wrong with Vidya ma’am.

762
00:54:09,255 --> 00:54:10,207
Sister...

763
00:54:10,287 --> 00:54:11,318
Sister...

764
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:12,607
Sister...

765
00:54:17,017 --> 00:54:19,577
Sister, please...
don’t close your eyes.

766
00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:22,591
Sister.

767
00:54:22,956 --> 00:54:23,532
Sister.

768
00:54:23,612 --> 00:54:25,768
Raghu, hurry up.

769
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:30,616
How much longer.
Drive faster.

770
00:55:00,099 --> 00:55:01,024
Hello, Shilpa.

771
00:56:08,853 --> 00:56:10,155
It was a heart-attack.

772
00:56:12,059 --> 00:56:13,732
We’ve thrombolysed her.

773
00:56:14,821 --> 00:56:16,036
First we’ll conduct an angiography...

774
00:56:16,116 --> 00:56:19,424
and then decide whether
we should do an angioplasty...

775
00:56:19,585 --> 00:56:20,913
or a open-heart surgery.

776
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:25,286
Please deposit 50,000 at
the reception and make a file.

777
00:56:25,873 --> 00:56:27,041
Excuse me.

778
00:56:48,896 --> 00:56:49,934
I care.

779
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:52,457
I care for my students.

780
00:56:52,537 --> 00:56:54,339
And I care for my teachers.

781
00:56:54,543 --> 00:56:56,436
And I always reward the winners.

782
00:56:56,674 --> 00:56:59,790
Mr. Rao, the All India Quiz winners...

783
00:57:00,338 --> 00:57:03,615
must be rewarded
by our Management as well.

784
00:57:04,296 --> 00:57:05,778
Where’s our picnic going?
To Manali?

785
00:57:05,858 --> 00:57:06,484
Yes, sir.

786
00:57:06,564 --> 00:57:09,509
See to it that the teachers
and the students... get free passes.

787
00:57:09,628 --> 00:57:10,766
- Please.
- Definitely sir.

788
00:57:10,846 --> 00:57:12,121
Let’s have a picture.

789
00:57:15,693 --> 00:57:17,114
By the way, Mr. Rao.

790
00:57:18,083 --> 00:57:20,997
What was Kanta Ben school’s
position in this quiz competition?

791
00:57:21,304 --> 00:57:23,122
Sir, they didn’t participate at all.

792
00:57:23,202 --> 00:57:23,994
Oh, really.

793
00:57:24,074 --> 00:57:27,274
And that idiot Anmol Parekh
wanted to compete with us.

794
00:57:27,761 --> 00:57:30,834
Sir, I’ve heard that
their principal...

795
00:57:30,914 --> 00:57:32,702
insulted one of
their senior teachers.

796
00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:34,591
And also terminated her.

797
00:57:35,142 --> 00:57:37,386
Poor teacher, she got a heart-attack.

798
00:57:37,576 --> 00:57:38,735
Oh, that’s bad.

799
00:57:38,932 --> 00:57:40,676
Why didn’t you tell me this before?

800
00:57:40,828 --> 00:57:42,702
I thought that it’s their...

801
00:57:43,766 --> 00:57:48,077
I should know everything
about Kanta Ben school.

802
00:57:48,345 --> 00:57:50,296
And not just me,
everyone must know.

803
00:57:50,878 --> 00:57:53,269
Anmol Parekh wants
to make his school famous.

804
00:57:53,457 --> 00:57:54,605
I’ll help him.

805
00:57:59,677 --> 00:58:02,824
Can I speak to
Ms. Bhairavi Thakkar please?

806
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:03,447
'A well-known institute
like Kanta Ben High School...'

807
00:59:03,593 --> 00:59:07,117
'fired their senior teacher,
Vidya Sawant from her job...'

808
00:59:07,197 --> 00:59:09,395
'stating that she
doesn’t know how to teach.'

809
00:59:09,783 --> 00:59:12,040
'Vidya Sawant,
who’s been teaching there...'

810
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:14,090
'for the last 28 years,
was so shocked...'

811
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:15,703
'that she suffered a heart-attack.'

812
00:59:15,841 --> 00:59:17,677
'Right now she’s in the hospital...'

813
00:59:17,757 --> 00:59:20,187
'and her condition seems critical.'

814
00:59:20,863 --> 00:59:22,475
'As you can see...'

815
00:59:22,670 --> 00:59:26,259
'there’s no one present here on behalf
of the school or the management.'

816
00:59:26,586 --> 00:59:30,054
'So is Vidya Sawant actually
incapable of teaching?'

817
00:59:30,226 --> 00:59:33,826
'Or is there some kind
of ruse behind her termination.'

818
00:59:36,679 --> 00:59:37,638
Yes.

819
00:59:39,154 --> 00:59:40,478
Principal,
what’s happening in my school?

820
00:59:40,558 --> 00:59:42,234
I am surprised myself, Anmol.

821
00:59:42,434 --> 00:59:43,669
It was a very small matter.

822
00:59:43,749 --> 00:59:45,265
It was a small school matter.

823
00:59:45,389 --> 00:59:48,001
No idea how it turned so big.
Utter nonsense.

824
00:59:49,452 --> 00:59:50,605
Wait a minute.

825
00:59:51,479 --> 00:59:54,011
I do see some sense in this nonsense.

826
00:59:54,787 --> 00:59:56,116
We’re getting free publicity...

827
00:59:56,244 --> 00:59:59,263
that we don’t even
spare our senior teachers...

828
00:59:59,447 --> 01:00:01,867
when it comes to our student’s
education and discipline.

829
01:00:02,137 --> 01:00:05,559
And you know...
any publicity is good publicity.

830
01:00:05,949 --> 01:00:06,875
Fine.

831
01:00:20,606 --> 01:00:22,047
Let’s come straight to the point.

832
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:25,871
The media’s inquiring
about Vidya’s case.

833
01:00:26,434 --> 01:00:29,124
If they question anyone...

834
01:00:29,716 --> 01:00:34,230
I would like you to say
that “Vidya hasn’t been keeping well”.

835
01:00:34,642 --> 01:00:36,574
“Vidya was an incapable teacher.”

836
01:00:36,909 --> 01:00:39,418
“Vidya couldn’t understand
the new syllabus.”

837
01:00:40,027 --> 01:00:42,909
And “Parents would
complain against Vidya”.

838
01:00:44,499 --> 01:00:45,778
Hope I am clear.

839
01:00:53,224 --> 01:00:54,864
Vidya has been fired.

840
01:00:56,010 --> 01:00:57,373
And you know why?

841
01:00:57,977 --> 01:01:01,007
Because she was a question mark
on the reputation of this school.

842
01:01:02,264 --> 01:01:03,978
And I hate question marks.

843
01:01:05,693 --> 01:01:07,205
I like full stops.

844
01:01:07,593 --> 01:01:10,197
And I would like to put
a full stop in this school...

845
01:01:10,934 --> 01:01:13,313
on Vidya Sawant’s case.

846
01:01:15,569 --> 01:01:17,870
Alright then, leave.

847
01:01:26,252 --> 01:01:29,485
Madam... none of them
will say anything.

848
01:01:30,022 --> 01:01:31,086
They’re not the problem.

849
01:01:31,214 --> 01:01:33,269
But what about that Jyoti?

850
01:01:52,535 --> 01:01:54,009
So fine, Mr. Sunil.

851
01:01:54,219 --> 01:01:57,617
Send us quotation for
30 computers and 10 laptops.

852
01:01:57,784 --> 01:02:00,780
And I promise you,
we won’t ask you for a discount.

853
01:02:01,059 --> 01:02:02,056
I’ll approve it.

854
01:02:02,570 --> 01:02:03,474
Thank you.

855
01:02:03,827 --> 01:02:05,105
Thank you so much.

856
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:08,756
Oh yeah...

857
01:02:09,381 --> 01:02:13,439
Tell Jyoti that I’ve promoted
her to Supervisor’s post.

858
01:02:13,655 --> 01:02:15,901
Tell her to join school... immediately.

859
01:02:16,794 --> 01:02:17,649
Thank you.

860
01:02:29,628 --> 01:02:32,015
Here you go, Thakurayin.
Your orange juice.

861
01:02:34,894 --> 01:02:38,312
Look, according to
me it’s not a bad proposal.

862
01:02:39,395 --> 01:02:40,861
You’re getting promoted...

863
01:02:41,166 --> 01:02:42,621
increment in salary.

864
01:02:42,761 --> 01:02:45,823
We’ll pay the car’s
EMI with the extra money.

865
01:02:46,050 --> 01:02:47,553
Don’t think too much.

866
01:02:50,597 --> 01:02:51,411
Sunil.

867
01:02:51,804 --> 01:02:55,434
What happens if someone
can’t pay the car loans EMI?

868
01:02:55,565 --> 01:02:56,320
What else?

869
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,908
The bank officials will
take the car back, what else?

870
01:02:59,686 --> 01:03:01,653
And why are you thinking
about this nonsense?

871
01:03:02,281 --> 01:03:05,026
Look... how long are
you going to stay here?

872
01:03:05,478 --> 01:03:07,368
Vidya will take time to recover.

873
01:03:07,668 --> 01:03:09,605
How long will you keep
taking leave from school?

874
01:03:09,793 --> 01:03:11,365
Don’t you want to do your job?

875
01:03:12,616 --> 01:03:14,436
- You can take a half-day as well.
- Hello.

876
01:03:14,602 --> 01:03:16,236
State Bank of Patiyala.

877
01:03:16,427 --> 01:03:18,211
Can I talk to Mrs. Mhatre?

878
01:03:18,455 --> 01:03:21,577
Ma’am, this is Jyoti Thakur.
Kanta Ben school’s teacher.

879
01:03:22,125 --> 01:03:24,361
Yes, I’ve a salaried
account in your bank.

880
01:03:24,524 --> 01:03:28,496
I took a car loan from
your bank and gave PDCs too.

881
01:03:29,325 --> 01:03:31,658
Ma’am, I want to
discontinue this car loan.

882
01:03:32,911 --> 01:03:34,735
Please take the car back.

883
01:03:35,221 --> 01:03:36,356
Yes, thank you ma’am.

884
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:38,746
What did you do?

885
01:03:39,207 --> 01:03:40,367
Have you lost your mind?

886
01:03:40,505 --> 01:03:43,352
I haven’t lost my mind,
you’ve become selfish.

887
01:03:44,477 --> 01:03:45,991
Did you ever think...

888
01:03:46,128 --> 01:03:50,898
why Gupta called only
you for the computer deal?

889
01:03:51,814 --> 01:03:55,069
Because... she wants to
buy my silence through you.

890
01:03:55,188 --> 01:03:56,245
You don’t have to say it out loud.

891
01:03:56,325 --> 01:03:58,396
She wants to make me the supervisor...

892
01:03:58,476 --> 01:04:00,676
so that I keep my mouth shut.

893
01:04:00,992 --> 01:04:03,099
And you... listened to her...

894
01:04:03,308 --> 01:04:05,176
and were trying to convince me.

895
01:04:05,686 --> 01:04:08,218
You’re supporting her instead of us.

896
01:04:08,352 --> 01:04:10,844
- I thought...
- No! You should be ashamed, Sunil.

897
01:04:11,056 --> 01:04:12,412
And now you please...

898
01:04:12,549 --> 01:04:14,768
go and sell your
computers to Gupta.

899
01:04:14,886 --> 01:04:16,228
And don’t ever talk to me.

900
01:04:17,017 --> 01:04:18,040
Jyoti.

901
01:04:20,457 --> 01:04:22,942
All teachers and staff,
attention please.

902
01:04:23,335 --> 01:04:25,384
Come down to the assembly hall.

903
01:04:26,088 --> 01:04:28,500
All teachers and staff,
attention please.

904
01:04:28,941 --> 01:04:31,772
Please come down to the
assembly hall right away.

905
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:33,948
I repeat...

906
01:04:34,761 --> 01:04:36,953
Please come down to the assembly hall.

907
01:04:54,519 --> 01:04:56,498
I called you all here.

908
01:04:57,338 --> 01:05:01,259
To tell you that you’re scared
of this Gupta for no reason.

909
01:05:02,103 --> 01:05:03,760
No need to be scared of her...

910
01:05:03,915 --> 01:05:05,695
because she’s scared
out of her wits herself.

911
01:05:05,775 --> 01:05:07,701
Jyoti, behave yourself.

912
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:10,724
Hey sycophant... you behave yourself.

913
01:05:11,196 --> 01:05:12,718
And call me madam.

914
01:05:12,890 --> 01:05:15,907
Jyoti madam.
The would-be Supervisor.

915
01:05:16,117 --> 01:05:18,580
All I need to do is say yes.

916
01:05:19,161 --> 01:05:20,263
Ask her.

917
01:05:21,098 --> 01:05:23,102
Am I right Kamini Gupta?

918
01:05:24,552 --> 01:05:26,102
You don’t get it, do you?

919
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:27,502
Allow me to explain.

920
01:05:28,073 --> 01:05:31,948
The Principal madam had this
conversation with my husband Sunil.

921
01:05:32,901 --> 01:05:35,172
She offered me the supervisor’s post.

922
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:38,334
Showed him the greed of
a contract for new computers.

923
01:05:38,507 --> 01:05:39,587
Do you know why?

924
01:05:39,991 --> 01:05:41,729
So that I don’t expose her.

925
01:05:42,477 --> 01:05:46,119
About how she takes undue
advantage of our need for this job.

926
01:05:46,595 --> 01:05:48,338
Exploits the teachers.

927
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:53,209
And this is why...
Vidya’s in the hospital today.

928
01:05:53,801 --> 01:05:56,148
Nusrat, am I right?

929
01:06:01,019 --> 01:06:02,046
Pinto ma’am?

930
01:06:07,495 --> 01:06:08,552
Manjeet?

931
01:06:10,572 --> 01:06:11,546
Say it.

932
01:06:14,767 --> 01:06:16,095
Did you get your answer?

933
01:06:18,673 --> 01:06:20,484
Prepare her termination letter.

934
01:06:23,139 --> 01:06:24,075
Stop.

935
01:06:25,607 --> 01:06:27,823
I’ve already brought
my resignation letter.

936
01:06:28,106 --> 01:06:30,126
With reason to resign.

937
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:32,584
And that is you.

938
01:06:33,904 --> 01:06:35,567
But I won’t give it to only you.

939
01:06:35,768 --> 01:06:37,579
I’ll send three more copies.

940
01:06:37,803 --> 01:06:39,939
First... to the Education Inspector.

941
01:06:40,188 --> 01:06:42,113
Second... Teacher’s Union.

942
01:06:42,193 --> 01:06:44,167
And Third... The management.

943
01:06:44,632 --> 01:06:47,356
Everyone should know
what’s going on in the school.

944
01:06:48,621 --> 01:06:49,480
Good idea.

945
01:06:50,985 --> 01:06:53,429
In fact... there’s a
Xerox machine in our office.

946
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:56,152
Why don’t you make 100-200 copies?

947
01:06:57,316 --> 01:06:58,985
You can give it to anyone you want.

948
01:06:59,485 --> 01:07:01,048
You can even send it to Delhi.

949
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:05,509
In fact, do let me
know if you need my help.

950
01:07:06,793 --> 01:07:10,280
Oh yeah... let me clear
your misunderstanding.

951
01:07:11,172 --> 01:07:14,101
They didn’t come
here because you called.

952
01:07:15,517 --> 01:07:17,327
They came here hearing my voice.

953
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:25,154
And even you came hearing
that voice... Kamini Gupta.

954
01:07:26,916 --> 01:07:28,637
And as far as support’s concerned.

955
01:07:29,251 --> 01:07:32,789
A person’s real support
is his own karma.

956
01:07:33,121 --> 01:07:36,236
His honesty... his self-respect...

957
01:07:36,827 --> 01:07:38,314
which you challenged.

958
01:07:38,518 --> 01:07:40,183
And now I’ll give you an answer.

959
01:07:41,082 --> 01:07:43,739
You like moving chairs, don’t you?

960
01:07:44,615 --> 01:07:46,236
Now another chair’s going to move.

961
01:07:54,101 --> 01:07:55,070
Yours!

962
01:08:29,456 --> 01:08:31,220
Thakurayin, where are you going?

963
01:08:36,162 --> 01:08:37,070
Sorry.

964
01:08:38,221 --> 01:08:40,014
You know my mind.

965
01:08:40,289 --> 01:08:42,463
Sometimes the hard
disk gets corrupted.

966
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:43,955
But it’s better now.

967
01:08:44,278 --> 01:08:45,739
Please, say yes.

968
01:08:48,932 --> 01:08:53,053
<i>"You've made me realise"</i>

969
01:08:53,324 --> 01:08:57,078
<i>"Hard times are temporary"</i>

970
01:08:57,285 --> 01:09:02,760
<i>"Step up to overcome the darkness"</i>

971
01:09:03,170 --> 01:09:07,017
<i>"Choose to stay
in the light of truth"</i>

972
01:09:07,224 --> 01:09:11,030
<i>"Weave out a new sun"</i>

973
01:09:11,306 --> 01:09:16,565
"Spread the light and brightness
among all"

974
01:09:17,007 --> 01:09:20,702
<i>"All the past and the future moments"</i>

975
01:09:20,782 --> 01:09:24,238
<i>“Walk with you holding your hands”</i>

976
01:09:24,501 --> 01:09:27,586
<i>"O life..."</i>

977
01:09:41,694 --> 01:09:42,738
'Hello.'

978
01:09:42,818 --> 01:09:44,739
'This is Bhairavi Thakkar,
welcoming you...'

979
01:09:44,819 --> 01:09:47,184
'to India News special
presentation, Abhiyaan.'

980
01:09:47,355 --> 01:09:49,564
'Today we’re going
to talk about Teachers.'

981
01:09:49,730 --> 01:09:51,463
'Teachers...meaning Guru.'

982
01:09:51,755 --> 01:09:53,316
'Gurus who have been given...'

983
01:09:53,396 --> 01:09:55,829
'a higher place than
God in our scriptures.'

984
01:09:56,001 --> 01:09:57,794
'Parents give birth...'

985
01:09:57,874 --> 01:09:58,979
'while teachers impart knowledge.'

986
01:09:59,132 --> 01:10:01,850
'One such teacher
is present here with us.'

987
01:10:01,930 --> 01:10:04,745
'Kanta Ben High School’s
Msc B.ED teacher...'

988
01:10:04,825 --> 01:10:07,031
- 'Jyoti Thakur.'
- 'Hello.'

989
01:10:07,623 --> 01:10:11,121
Please tell us, how did you
get into teaching profession?

990
01:10:12,612 --> 01:10:14,790
I once heard it is a noble profession.

991
01:10:15,534 --> 01:10:17,104
And you just said that...

992
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:20,535
these things have been
written for Gurus in our scriptures.

993
01:10:20,825 --> 01:10:23,861
But I believe that it
remained in the scriptures.

994
01:10:24,054 --> 01:10:25,018
No one implied it in real life.

995
01:10:25,167 --> 01:10:27,730
That’s Jyoti ma’am, my school teacher.

996
01:10:28,139 --> 01:10:31,258
If it was true... then Vidya
ma’am wouldn’t be in hospital today.

997
01:10:31,515 --> 01:10:34,311
Let me tell the viewers, that
Vidya Sawant is the same teacher...

998
01:10:34,391 --> 01:10:37,878
whom Kanta Ben school humiliated
and fired her from her job.

999
01:10:37,958 --> 01:10:41,235
Sorry Bhairavi,
the school didn’t terminate her.

1000
01:10:41,816 --> 01:10:44,550
- The current system did.
- System?

1001
01:10:44,816 --> 01:10:45,940
How’s that?

1002
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:50,052
Our system.
Especially the education system.

1003
01:10:50,683 --> 01:10:51,945
For example...

1004
01:10:52,025 --> 01:10:53,666
- Come on, it’ll be fun.
- Those who are in Defence.

1005
01:10:53,746 --> 01:10:56,041
get a lot of respect... and amenities.

1006
01:10:56,323 --> 01:10:58,706
Like... a home for staying.
Travelling allowance.

1007
01:10:58,786 --> 01:11:01,769
Medical facilities.
Canteen... etcetera.

1008
01:11:01,963 --> 01:11:03,317
And they should get all this.

1009
01:11:03,454 --> 01:11:05,937
Because they protect our country.

1010
01:11:06,368 --> 01:11:09,136
And what about those... who
educate the country?

1011
01:11:09,346 --> 01:11:12,872
Don’t they have a right
to any respect or amenities?

1012
01:11:13,198 --> 01:11:14,383
- Sahil.
- Huh?

1013
01:11:14,559 --> 01:11:15,976
Take Multinational
Companies for example.

1014
01:11:16,056 --> 01:11:16,850
That’s my teacher.

1015
01:11:16,930 --> 01:11:20,075
They do everything possible
for the comfort of their workers.

1016
01:11:20,591 --> 01:11:22,495
Even if you start at a Call-centre...

1017
01:11:22,672 --> 01:11:26,375
their starting salary is just
as much as Vidya madam’s salary...

1018
01:11:26,455 --> 01:11:28,401
after 28 years of service.

1019
01:11:29,015 --> 01:11:30,343
And I challenge you...

1020
01:11:30,423 --> 01:11:33,930
none of them is
as educated as Vidya ma’am.

1021
01:11:34,346 --> 01:11:36,748
The only difference is the profession.

1022
01:11:37,937 --> 01:11:40,916
The company car picks
them up and drops them home.

1023
01:11:41,331 --> 01:11:43,899
We teachers...
don’t even get concessions...

1024
01:11:44,082 --> 01:11:45,537
in trains or busses.

1025
01:11:45,676 --> 01:11:47,724
But teachers get respect.

1026
01:11:49,374 --> 01:11:50,381
Respect?

1027
01:11:50,881 --> 01:11:53,485
In our country,
only those people get respect...

1028
01:11:53,613 --> 01:11:56,973
whose got a
high-paying salary. Power.

1029
01:11:57,776 --> 01:12:02,503
Politicians get respect,
film-stars, cricketers.

1030
01:12:02,763 --> 01:12:04,656
They are made chief guests...

1031
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,310
invited to cut ribbons.

1032
01:12:06,974 --> 01:12:10,379
Have you ever heard of
a teacher being a celebrity...

1033
01:12:10,536 --> 01:12:12,938
and she was invited
to inaugurate something?

1034
01:12:13,131 --> 01:12:14,736
Have you ever seen any teacher...

1035
01:12:14,816 --> 01:12:17,504
arriving in a BMW or a AUDI?

1036
01:12:17,995 --> 01:12:19,029
Wearing loin-cloth and kurta...

1037
01:12:19,109 --> 01:12:22,128
walking on foot, wearing
slippers and holding umbrella in hand.

1038
01:12:22,443 --> 01:12:24,033
That’s the image of a teacher.

1039
01:12:24,564 --> 01:12:25,706
And it’s true.

1040
01:12:26,326 --> 01:12:28,186
Compared to a teacher’s salary...

1041
01:12:28,634 --> 01:12:30,711
they barely manage
to make ends meet.

1042
01:12:30,914 --> 01:12:32,151
Don’t teachers get...

1043
01:12:32,231 --> 01:12:34,695
some kind of allowance
or subsidy from the government?

1044
01:12:35,565 --> 01:12:37,151
We do get allowance.

1045
01:12:38,342 --> 01:12:40,431
Teachers get an allowance...

1046
01:12:40,511 --> 01:12:44,575
for standing 3 hours
during SSC exams and supervise.

1047
01:12:44,982 --> 01:12:45,889
Do you know how much?

1048
01:12:46,461 --> 01:12:47,455
25 rupees.

1049
01:12:47,612 --> 01:12:49,016
Only 25 rupees?

1050
01:12:49,504 --> 01:12:53,639
And 4.25 rupees for
checking one answer sheet.

1051
01:12:53,778 --> 01:12:54,672
How much?

1052
01:12:54,841 --> 01:12:56,027
4.25 rupees.

1053
01:12:56,247 --> 01:12:58,551
25 paise which has stopped...

1054
01:12:58,759 --> 01:13:00,566
still implies on us teachers.

1055
01:13:01,356 --> 01:13:05,329
And this money comes from
the government, and not the school.

1056
01:13:06,065 --> 01:13:08,600
Bhairavi, even after working so hard...

1057
01:13:09,050 --> 01:13:10,886
teachers have no job security.

1058
01:13:11,550 --> 01:13:15,254
They can be fired from
their job at any time.

1059
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:16,505
Is that so?

1060
01:13:16,585 --> 01:13:17,833
Sometimes as surplus...

1061
01:13:17,913 --> 01:13:19,301
or sometimes by
calling us incapable.

1062
01:13:19,455 --> 01:13:22,023
Just like Kanta Ben fired Vidya ma’am.

1063
01:13:22,252 --> 01:13:25,306
No one cares about how qualified
a particular teacher is...

1064
01:13:25,386 --> 01:13:27,011
or about her experience.

1065
01:13:27,310 --> 01:13:29,502
All they care is they
have to pay less money.

1066
01:13:29,993 --> 01:13:34,943
And untrained, unqualified
people are appointed in their place.

1067
01:13:36,299 --> 01:13:37,744
That’s very sad.

1068
01:13:38,551 --> 01:13:41,136
Jyoti, what would you
like to say in the end?

1069
01:13:44,801 --> 01:13:46,517
I don’t want to say anything.

1070
01:13:47,419 --> 01:13:49,190
I just want to ask...

1071
01:13:50,037 --> 01:13:52,716
How can anyone forget their teachers?

1072
01:13:54,570 --> 01:13:58,810
Do the progressive people
of our progressive country...

1073
01:13:59,018 --> 01:14:01,550
remember the name
of their teacher...

1074
01:14:01,863 --> 01:14:04,334
who taught them ABC?

1075
01:14:04,864 --> 01:14:07,615
Or... taught them the tables.

1076
01:14:08,483 --> 01:14:11,194
From KG to SSC and then college.

1077
01:14:11,554 --> 01:14:14,942
Many teachers bathed you
in the pool of their knowledge.

1078
01:14:15,562 --> 01:14:17,765
But what did you give them in return?

1079
01:14:18,612 --> 01:14:23,626
Did anyone think about wishing
their teacher good morning...

1080
01:14:23,869 --> 01:14:28,652
or how are you ma’am, or
Happy Diwali or even Happy New Year.

1081
01:14:29,530 --> 01:14:31,019
Just like the students need...

1082
01:14:31,099 --> 01:14:32,938
their teacher’s knowledge,
similarly...

1083
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:36,877
the teachers need their
students love and respect.

1084
01:14:37,726 --> 01:14:39,159
Everyone in our country...

1085
01:14:39,428 --> 01:14:42,646
talks about the bond
between Dronacharya and Arjun.

1086
01:14:43,732 --> 01:14:45,684
Right now Dronacharya is sick.

1087
01:14:46,562 --> 01:14:48,091
She’s in the hospital...

1088
01:14:48,776 --> 01:14:50,382
and she’s in need.

1089
01:14:51,136 --> 01:14:54,415
I want to know...
where are her Arjun.

1090
01:14:55,543 --> 01:14:56,962
Where are they?

1091
01:14:57,862 --> 01:14:58,927
Answer me.

1092
01:14:59,992 --> 01:15:01,525
Not even one of them...

1093
01:15:01,965 --> 01:15:04,724
come up to ask about
her teacher’s condition.

1094
01:15:12,512 --> 01:15:14,007
Thank you, Jyoti.

1095
01:15:15,308 --> 01:15:17,909
So this is the current
condition of teachers.

1096
01:15:18,386 --> 01:15:22,058
There should be a new beginning
in the lives of the teachers.

1097
01:15:22,279 --> 01:15:24,598
A change is required in the society.

1098
01:15:25,063 --> 01:15:27,947
And so India News will continue this.

1099
01:15:28,083 --> 01:15:28,915
Good night.

1100
01:15:44,532 --> 01:15:46,462
Did you see Jyoti madam’s
interview yesterday?

1101
01:15:46,669 --> 01:15:48,078
No. what was it in it?

1102
01:15:48,158 --> 01:15:49,454
Baby, you missed it.

1103
01:15:50,859 --> 01:15:53,528
First download the video,
and show it to your friends.

1104
01:15:53,608 --> 01:15:55,798
I want every student
to watch this interview.

1105
01:16:05,538 --> 01:16:07,002
Honestly, she’s right.

1106
01:16:07,082 --> 01:16:08,495
We’ve actually forgotten
our teachers.

1107
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:09,545
Yes.

1108
01:16:10,374 --> 01:16:14,257
You know guys, I found
the numbers of all my teachers...

1109
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:15,937
and sent them
a good morning message.

1110
01:16:16,017 --> 01:16:16,953
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

1111
01:16:17,033 --> 01:16:17,887
Good morning.

1112
01:16:18,503 --> 01:16:20,110
- Let’s meet after class.
- Yes, of course.

1113
01:16:20,190 --> 01:16:22,013
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning.

1114
01:16:22,694 --> 01:16:24,535
- Good morning, sir.
- Good. Morning.

1115
01:16:25,763 --> 01:16:28,802
Vijay sir, are they all feeling okay?

1116
01:16:29,302 --> 01:16:32,167
I guess they saw Bhairavi’s
program yesterday.

1117
01:16:32,954 --> 01:16:34,327
- Look, sir.
- Hi, guys.

1118
01:16:35,788 --> 01:16:38,578
Even I sent my teacher
good morning message.

1119
01:16:39,605 --> 01:16:41,399
- Nice.
- Yes, sir.

1120
01:16:42,717 --> 01:16:43,573
Bhairavi.

1121
01:16:43,653 --> 01:16:46,619
Kanta Ben school’s MD Mr.
Parekh’s on the line.

1122
01:16:47,504 --> 01:16:49,264
Put him on hold for a while.

1123
01:16:49,443 --> 01:16:50,910
Tell him I am busy.

1124
01:16:53,245 --> 01:16:54,219
What’s wrong, son?

1125
01:16:54,299 --> 01:16:55,313
- What...
- The...

1126
01:16:55,845 --> 01:16:58,568
- She put me on hold.
- Okay, cool.

1127
01:16:58,851 --> 01:16:59,620
No problem.

1128
01:17:06,551 --> 01:17:07,538
Bhairavi here.

1129
01:17:08,158 --> 01:17:09,402
- Okay?
- How dare you?

1130
01:17:10,234 --> 01:17:11,436
How dare you?

1131
01:17:11,742 --> 01:17:13,987
You humiliated my
school over the media.

1132
01:17:14,386 --> 01:17:16,334
I’ll sue you in the court
of law for this, do you get that?

1133
01:17:16,414 --> 01:17:19,939
Then call your lawyer,
stop wasting my time.

1134
01:17:20,019 --> 01:17:21,661
- Hey you...
- Anmol.

1135
01:17:21,812 --> 01:17:24,141
Anmol. Anmol. Anmol.

1136
01:17:30,157 --> 01:17:34,651
Bhairavi, we should be
helping each other.

1137
01:17:35,037 --> 01:17:38,416
- You’re a Gujarati, and so...
- Talk in Hindi.

1138
01:17:38,832 --> 01:17:40,271
Our national language.

1139
01:17:40,426 --> 01:17:42,139
Even my interview was in Hindi.

1140
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:45,890
And I work for a national
news channel. Get that?

1141
01:17:46,028 --> 01:17:47,674
You’re such a rude girl.

1142
01:17:48,428 --> 01:17:52,015
You’re a Gujarati, I am a Gujarati
so I am trying to explain you...

1143
01:17:52,498 --> 01:17:53,919
I am like a father to you.

1144
01:17:54,109 --> 01:17:57,000
Excuse me, you’re not my daddy.

1145
01:17:57,441 --> 01:17:59,601
And my papa is a very nice man.

1146
01:17:59,751 --> 01:18:01,513
He never filches anyone’s rights.

1147
01:18:01,660 --> 01:18:04,214
And stop ranting
about “I am Gujarati”.

1148
01:18:04,498 --> 01:18:07,018
What’s so special about
you being a Gujarati?

1149
01:18:07,383 --> 01:18:11,601
Our Gujarat is known by Sardar Patel,
Mahatma Gandhi.

1150
01:18:11,734 --> 01:18:13,169
Not by people like you.

1151
01:18:13,311 --> 01:18:14,181
Understand.

1152
01:18:14,485 --> 01:18:16,447
Well, since even our Prime
Minister is a Gujarati now...

1153
01:18:16,527 --> 01:18:18,037
I’ll explain you in Gujarati.

1154
01:18:18,394 --> 01:18:21,660
Give your school teachers
their due rights...

1155
01:18:21,887 --> 01:18:23,958
or else I will ruin you.

1156
01:18:24,181 --> 01:18:25,481
Glory to Goddess.

1157
01:18:30,484 --> 01:18:31,548
'Everyone in our country...'

1158
01:18:32,328 --> 01:18:35,285
'talks about the bond
between Dronacharya and Arjun.'

1159
01:18:35,807 --> 01:18:37,786
'Right now Dronacharya is sick.'

1160
01:18:38,411 --> 01:18:39,758
'She’s in the hospital...'

1161
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:41,974
'and she’s in need.'

1162
01:18:42,542 --> 01:18:45,934
'I want to know...where
are her Arjun.'

1163
01:18:46,978 --> 01:18:48,191
'Where are they?'

1164
01:18:49,192 --> 01:18:51,351
Just watch, I am going to win.

1165
01:18:52,258 --> 01:18:53,614
Hello, brother.

1166
01:18:54,445 --> 01:18:55,817
We’re Vidya madam’s Arjun!

1167
01:18:55,948 --> 01:18:57,743
We’re starting a rally in her support.

1168
01:18:57,823 --> 01:18:58,611
Will you join us?

1169
01:18:58,729 --> 01:19:00,213
But we never studied in her school.

1170
01:19:00,293 --> 01:19:02,615
Yes. She’s not our teacher.

1171
01:19:02,742 --> 01:19:05,415
But brother,
she is a teacher after all.

1172
01:19:05,852 --> 01:19:07,563
Fine, if you’re not Arjun...

1173
01:19:07,643 --> 01:19:09,394
you can definitely be her Eklavya.

1174
01:19:09,638 --> 01:19:10,612
Yes, brother.

1175
01:19:10,692 --> 01:19:12,034
Eklavya Singh.

1176
01:19:15,245 --> 01:19:16,700
Is that so?
Let’s go.

1177
01:19:16,883 --> 01:19:21,105
- Blessed is the person...
- who says 'God is Truth'!

1178
01:19:49,402 --> 01:19:51,685
The LED artery is 100 percent blocked.

1179
01:20:02,034 --> 01:20:04,745
Stint is deployed.
Angioplasty is successful.

1180
01:20:36,589 --> 01:20:38,416
Ms. Gupta, please come.

1181
01:20:38,586 --> 01:20:40,196
- Hello, Ms. Kamini.
- Hello.

1182
01:20:40,362 --> 01:20:41,663
- Hello.
- Have a seat.

1183
01:20:42,039 --> 01:20:43,041
After you.

1184
01:20:48,233 --> 01:20:49,447
Ms. Gupta.

1185
01:20:50,044 --> 01:20:53,397
This is the chief editor
of 3S News Channel.

1186
01:20:53,477 --> 01:20:54,896
Mr. Avinash Kumar.

1187
01:20:56,396 --> 01:20:59,859
Well, Mr. Avinash, ma’am... sirs...

1188
01:21:00,506 --> 01:21:03,900
all I would like to say is,
with big powers...

1189
01:21:04,181 --> 01:21:06,084
come big responsibility.

1190
01:21:06,311 --> 01:21:07,387
I am the principal...

1191
01:21:07,467 --> 01:21:09,622
of a prestigious
school like Kanta Ben.

1192
01:21:10,032 --> 01:21:12,454
I mean... the school’s
been named after...

1193
01:21:12,573 --> 01:21:13,960
sir’s great grandmother.

1194
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:17,170
I can’t give you any
reasons to let you down, sir.

1195
01:21:17,801 --> 01:21:19,888
Our school’s showing
such considerable progress...

1196
01:21:19,968 --> 01:21:22,586
and many rich families
are applying for admission...

1197
01:21:22,666 --> 01:21:24,367
during this session.

1198
01:21:24,977 --> 01:21:26,584
So, in order to match
their standards...

1199
01:21:26,664 --> 01:21:29,248
we’ll have to bring up
our teaching standards too, sir.

1200
01:21:30,757 --> 01:21:33,255
I don’t want incompetent
teachers, and...

1201
01:21:33,836 --> 01:21:35,489
it’s such a big issue.

1202
01:21:36,577 --> 01:21:37,727
Excuse me.

1203
01:21:39,589 --> 01:21:41,167
Can I have a glass of water, please?

1204
01:21:41,948 --> 01:21:43,830
- Ours is a private school.
- Thank you.

1205
01:21:44,113 --> 01:21:46,382
We can keep or fire whoever we want.

1206
01:21:46,642 --> 01:21:47,704
It’s our decision.

1207
01:21:47,904 --> 01:21:48,969
Who are these people?

1208
01:21:49,509 --> 01:21:51,626
We’re not sitting
here to do social work.

1209
01:21:52,165 --> 01:21:53,474
- Mr. Avinash.
- Yes.

1210
01:21:54,553 --> 01:21:55,819
What must we do?

1211
01:21:56,434 --> 01:21:59,174
I suggest Mansukh,
that we apologise and end this matter.

1212
01:21:59,254 --> 01:22:03,256
What? We will apologies to
those worthless and useless teachers?

1213
01:22:04,601 --> 01:22:07,057
I am Anmol Parekh,
I never apologised to anyone.

1214
01:22:07,137 --> 01:22:08,701
What crap is this, dad?

1215
01:22:08,948 --> 01:22:11,259
You see sir... once we apologise...

1216
01:22:11,339 --> 01:22:13,514
then they will blame
the management for every mistake.

1217
01:22:13,638 --> 01:22:14,333
Correct.

1218
01:22:14,413 --> 01:22:15,473
Today it’s just two people
raising their voices...

1219
01:22:15,553 --> 01:22:16,575
tomorrow it can be ten.

1220
01:22:17,010 --> 01:22:18,511
Will we apologise to everyone?

1221
01:22:19,383 --> 01:22:20,614
Right, Mr. Avinash.

1222
01:22:21,741 --> 01:22:24,276
I also feel whatever
she’s saying is right.

1223
01:22:25,321 --> 01:22:28,103
According to me,
you should all stick to your stand...

1224
01:22:28,183 --> 01:22:30,925
that Vidya and Jyoti
are incapable of teaching.

1225
01:22:31,094 --> 01:22:33,240
And there’s no way
for these teachers...

1226
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:35,086
to prove their capability.

1227
01:22:36,183 --> 01:22:37,140
And I will...

1228
01:22:37,844 --> 01:22:38,867
handle the rest.

1229
01:22:39,757 --> 01:22:40,820
Thanks for your support.

1230
01:22:45,884 --> 01:22:48,159
'One of Mumbai’s reputed school,
Kanta Ben...'

1231
01:22:48,451 --> 01:22:52,282
'dismissed two of its teachers,
Vidya Sawant and Jyoti Thakur.'

1232
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:53,970
'But why?'

1233
01:22:54,989 --> 01:22:56,450
'There must be some reason behind it.'

1234
01:22:57,062 --> 01:22:59,816
'We’ll bring you the
truth on 3S news network.'

1235
01:23:00,322 --> 01:23:05,438
'Come, let’s talk to Kanta Ben’s
principal Kamini Gupta...'

1236
01:23:05,576 --> 01:23:07,466
'It’s a competitive era.'

1237
01:23:07,546 --> 01:23:10,982
'We need new syllabus,
and people with new ideas.'

1238
01:23:11,151 --> 01:23:12,616
'We require updated teachers...'

1239
01:23:12,696 --> 01:23:14,615
'with pretty high IQ levels.'

1240
01:23:14,776 --> 01:23:16,685
'We can’t allow such
incompetent teachers...'

1241
01:23:16,765 --> 01:23:18,923
'and play with the
future of our children.'

1242
01:23:19,061 --> 01:23:20,107
'Yes.'

1243
01:23:20,336 --> 01:23:23,385
'Look... Vidya’s method
of teaching maths...'

1244
01:23:23,465 --> 01:23:25,349
'is very old and very outdated.'

1245
01:23:25,581 --> 01:23:28,077
'And Jyoti’s more interested...'

1246
01:23:28,157 --> 01:23:31,031
'in mimicry, dance
rather than teaching science.'

1247
01:23:31,589 --> 01:23:33,474
'I need good teachers for my school...'

1248
01:23:33,706 --> 01:23:34,533
'Not jokers!'

1249
01:23:34,708 --> 01:23:35,941
'Thank you, Ms. Kamini.'

1250
01:23:36,503 --> 01:23:38,184
'And now they have only one motive...'

1251
01:23:38,264 --> 01:23:41,055
'behind telling their
fake sob story to the media.'

1252
01:23:41,485 --> 01:23:44,615
'To make you emotional
and gain your sympathy.'

1253
01:23:44,798 --> 01:23:49,354
'Please don’t hand the
future of your children...'

1254
01:23:49,823 --> 01:23:51,250
'who are not good teachers.'

1255
01:23:51,643 --> 01:23:52,921
'They are fake.'

1256
01:23:53,398 --> 01:23:57,308
'And as far as her
heart-attack’s concerned...'

1257
01:23:57,611 --> 01:24:01,265
'let’s talk to famous
cardiologist Dr. IP Singh...'

1258
01:24:01,345 --> 01:24:02,818
'who’s present
with us in our studio.'

1259
01:24:02,954 --> 01:24:06,129
- 'Doctor, it’s been said that...'
- Hey.

1260
01:24:06,339 --> 01:24:07,677
What’s up, Bhairavi? How are you?

1261
01:24:07,757 --> 01:24:13,353
Manish, I want to clobber
that guy with my shoe.

1262
01:24:13,534 --> 01:24:15,529
I am sure the management’s bribed him.

1263
01:24:15,704 --> 01:24:17,334
After watching his show
people will be confused...

1264
01:24:17,414 --> 01:24:19,048
about who they should believe.

1265
01:24:19,236 --> 01:24:21,315
We received some mails
on the India News ID.

1266
01:24:21,395 --> 01:24:23,360
They might be useful to you.
It might help you.

1267
01:24:25,447 --> 01:24:26,619
Thank you.

1268

Mom.

1271

Mom... you’re awake.

1272
01:24:51,238 --> 01:24:54,050
Wait. I’ll go inform the doctor.

1273
01:24:55,623 --> 01:24:57,588
How is your father?

1274
01:24:58,232 --> 01:24:59,184
Mom.

1275
01:25:04,468 --> 01:25:07,575
Here you go... talk to father yourself.

1276
01:25:08,138 --> 01:25:09,469
I’ll be right back.

1277
01:25:17,705 --> 01:25:19,775
Hello, Shilpa. Is everything okay?

1278
01:25:21,308 --> 01:25:22,985
Hello, sir.

1279
01:25:24,474 --> 01:25:26,069
How are you?

1280
01:25:31,958 --> 01:25:33,657
You’re in the hospital...

1281
01:25:34,023 --> 01:25:36,141
and you’re asking
about my condition?

1282
01:25:36,957 --> 01:25:39,129
There are people
here to look after me.

1283
01:25:40,586 --> 01:25:42,276
But you’re all alone.

1284
01:25:42,430 --> 01:25:44,517
No, I am not alone either.

1285
01:25:44,730 --> 01:25:49,459
All your students come here,
everyday... to study.

1286
01:25:49,598 --> 01:25:52,576
And they also take care of my food.

1287
01:25:53,909 --> 01:25:56,705
Look... Vinita made tea for me.

1288
01:25:58,059 --> 01:26:02,501
I am reaping the rewards
of my wife’s good deeds.

1289
01:26:05,584 --> 01:26:10,150
Look after yourself, we’ll meet soon.

1290
01:26:13,211 --> 01:26:17,490
Vidya... I’ve thought
about some new chess moves.

1291
01:26:18,082 --> 01:26:20,129
This time I will
definitely defeat you.

1292
01:26:20,555 --> 01:26:22,005
I see.

1293
01:26:22,686 --> 01:26:24,502
You reset the game.

1294
01:26:25,354 --> 01:26:27,292
See you soon.

1295
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:32,124
And we’re all waiting
for our Vidya ma’am.

1296
01:26:32,467 --> 01:26:33,358
Isn’t it?

1297
01:26:33,485 --> 01:26:36,424
- Isn’t it?

Let’s go give this
to her today evening.

1307
01:27:21,204 --> 01:27:22,723
She will need it.

You’re looking so fresh, so nice.

1312
01:27:50,111 --> 01:27:51,921
Should I call your students?

1313
01:27:52,109 --> 01:27:53,199
I’ll hit you.

1314
01:27:53,411 --> 01:27:55,712
Sister, I say you
should hit her some day.

1315
01:27:55,896 --> 01:27:58,219
It’s not my cup of tea.
Only you can do it.

1316
01:27:58,573 --> 01:27:59,538
Quiet.

1317
01:27:59,671 --> 01:28:00,891
See...

Hi, Bhairavi.

Yeah. Okay.

No, sister...

1401
01:31:41,585 --> 01:31:47,235
It’s the reward of
what you did all your life.

1992 batch.

1415
01:32:23,926 --> 01:32:26,739
Everyone used to call me JD.

1416
01:32:27,124 --> 01:32:28,085
But not you.

1417
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:32,287
You used to say “JD sounds
like the name of a smuggler”.

1418
01:32:33,210 --> 01:32:36,154
You used to call me Javed.

1419
01:32:37,911 --> 01:32:39,625
Javed Durani?

1420
01:32:41,526 --> 01:32:43,222
Sorry, I didn’t recognise you.

1421
01:32:43,652 --> 01:32:45,450
You’ve changed so drastically.

1422
01:32:48,793 --> 01:32:50,565
But you haven’t changed at all.

1423
01:32:53,562 --> 01:32:57,021
You’re still my Vidya ma’am.

1424
01:32:58,695 --> 01:32:59,559
Ting!

1425
01:33:00,909 --> 01:33:02,933
Isn’t that what I used to do in class?

1426
01:33:03,083 --> 01:33:04,305
I am sorry, ma’am.

1427
01:33:05,421 --> 01:33:06,807
Actually, I was in London...

1428
01:33:07,011 --> 01:33:09,332
that’s why I found
out really late about you.

1429
01:33:09,580 --> 01:33:11,059
But now I am here.

1430
01:33:17,603 --> 01:33:20,778
BP is normal, sugar is in check.

1431
01:33:21,079 --> 01:33:22,541
Everything is okay.

1432
01:33:23,224 --> 01:33:25,575
Doctor, I want somebody with her 24/7.

1433
01:33:25,773 --> 01:33:28,921
And keep informing me directly
about her health updates.

1434
01:33:29,001 --> 01:33:30,454
- Okay?
- Sure, sir.

1435
01:33:31,323 --> 01:33:32,543
And you, ma’am.

1436
01:33:32,712 --> 01:33:35,129
You’ll just rest. Only rest.

1437
01:33:35,426 --> 01:33:36,972
Otherwise for the first time...

1438
01:33:37,191 --> 01:33:40,266
a student will have
to scold his teacher.

1439
01:33:44,418 --> 01:33:45,384
Take care.

1440
01:33:51,069 --> 01:33:52,972
How can she rest?

1441
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:55,636
We’ll have to arrange
for the hospital bill.

1442
01:33:57,492 --> 01:34:01,029
Vidya ma’am, your ex-student,
Dr. Javed...

1443
01:34:01,212 --> 01:34:03,886
is a leading
heart-surgeon of our country.

1444
01:34:04,081 --> 01:34:06,272
And also the director
of this hospital.

1445
01:34:06,631 --> 01:34:09,449
All your bills have been waived off.

1446
01:34:09,999 --> 01:34:11,659
And sir has given orders...

1447
01:34:11,910 --> 01:34:17,235
to shift you to VIP ward,
because you’re her favourite teacher.

1448
01:34:17,599 --> 01:34:18,883
How sweet.

1449
01:34:34,863 --> 01:34:35,660
Come.

1450
01:34:36,137 --> 01:34:37,183
Welcome, sir.

1451
01:34:38,246 --> 01:34:41,833
We ministers have high expectations
with officers like you.

1452
01:34:42,391 --> 01:34:44,871
Get the teacher’s case sorted out.

1453
01:34:45,053 --> 01:34:46,951
It’s created a lot of stir.

1454
01:34:47,131 --> 01:34:50,563
Sir, when to capable teachers are
insulted and fired from the school...

1455
01:34:50,762 --> 01:34:51,904
it’s bound to create a stir.

1456
01:34:52,029 --> 01:34:52,776
Right.

1457
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:53,757
Right.

1458
01:34:54,158 --> 01:34:58,440
But you know,
I’ll get them a better job...

1459
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:00,765
with better salary.

1460
01:35:01,285 --> 01:35:05,867
Plus, I’ll tell Mr.
Parekh to pay them one million each.

1461
01:35:06,043 --> 01:35:07,713
But sir, why a different school?

1462
01:35:07,793 --> 01:35:08,554
Why?

1463
01:35:08,678 --> 01:35:10,484
Why don’t these people
admit their mistake?

1464
01:35:10,564 --> 01:35:11,946
Rich people.

1465
01:35:12,503 --> 01:35:13,655
Big people...

1466
01:35:14,031 --> 01:35:15,603
Big people are never wrong.

1467
01:35:15,821 --> 01:35:17,751
You see,
they’ll shake up the system...

1468
01:35:17,831 --> 01:35:19,726
but never budge from their stand.

1469
01:35:20,006 --> 01:35:20,932
Right?

1470
01:35:21,564 --> 01:35:24,899
Look, sir.
Since it’s a private school...

1471
01:35:25,042 --> 01:35:27,104
officially we cannot do anything.

1472
01:35:27,304 --> 01:35:28,371
S***

1473
01:35:31,244 --> 01:35:34,645
But yes... on a personal level.

1474
01:35:36,638 --> 01:35:39,494
Sir, I want a meeting
with both the parties.

1475
01:35:39,618 --> 01:35:40,615
Consider it done.

1476
01:35:40,734 --> 01:35:41,403
- Done.
- Yeah.

1477
01:35:41,483 --> 01:35:42,470
Done. Done.

1478
01:35:43,258 --> 01:35:44,334
Good, sir.

1479
01:36:11,740 --> 01:36:12,698
Are you sure?

1480
01:36:13,673 --> 01:36:16,049
- Will this solve the problem?
- Definitely, sir.

1481
01:36:16,216 --> 01:36:18,535
Live... in front of everyone.

1482
01:36:18,792 --> 01:36:21,134
Right now they have
the public’s sympathy.

1483
01:36:21,338 --> 01:36:22,994
So let the public only decide.

1484
01:36:23,074 --> 01:36:25,974
But... isn’t the amount a bit too high.

1485
01:36:26,408 --> 01:36:29,561
Only if we let them win.

1486
01:36:32,234 --> 01:36:35,823
Mr. Rajiv,
this will work only on one condition.

1487
01:36:37,067 --> 01:36:38,774
It’ll be our questions.

1488
01:36:39,948 --> 01:36:41,754
And I will make the questions?

1489
01:36:49,461 --> 01:36:50,588
Okay, done.

1490
01:36:51,143 --> 01:36:53,627
I’ll put your name
in Selector’s panel.

1491
01:36:58,471 --> 01:36:59,997
What if we lose?

1492
01:37:01,327 --> 01:37:04,017
Mom, I think we should
take sir’s advice.

1493
01:37:04,253 --> 01:37:05,776
Let’s take the one million...

1494
01:37:06,074 --> 01:37:08,377
and you can get
a job in Virar itself.

1495
01:37:09,238 --> 01:37:10,491
No, Shilpa.

1496
01:37:11,223 --> 01:37:13,849
This will prove the school right,
and us wrong.

1497
01:37:15,486 --> 01:37:17,319
We’ll have to give this trial.

1498
01:37:18,426 --> 01:37:19,325
Right, sister?

1499
01:37:20,322 --> 01:37:23,909
Sister, I suggest there’s
no need to do all this.

1500
01:37:24,569 --> 01:37:26,783
Everyone knows what the truth is.

1501
01:37:27,163 --> 01:37:31,759
Everyone also knew
that Sita was chaste...

1502
01:37:32,180 --> 01:37:34,916
yet she had to give a trial.

1503
01:37:35,779 --> 01:37:38,095
When it can happen in Ram’s reign...

1504
01:37:38,604 --> 01:37:40,441
then this is the Modern era.

1505
01:37:43,369 --> 01:37:44,799
We’re ready.

1506
01:37:51,779 --> 01:37:54,347
I knew that would be your answer.

1507
01:37:56,300 --> 01:37:58,099
I’ll make the preparations.

1508
01:38:02,489 --> 01:38:04,873
Mom. Teacher aunt’s back.

1509
01:38:05,549 --> 01:38:06,757
Careful, mom.

1510
01:38:14,810 --> 01:38:16,149
How are you?

1511
01:38:30,695 --> 01:38:31,775
Come.

1512
01:38:45,383 --> 01:38:46,172
Come on.

1513
01:38:47,227 --> 01:38:48,311
Yes, yes.

1514
01:38:48,561 --> 01:38:49,871
Yes, Mr. Deepak.

1515
01:38:49,981 --> 01:38:50,906
Yes.

1516
01:38:51,225 --> 01:38:53,352
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

1517
01:38:54,494 --> 01:38:55,760
Okay, done.

1518
01:38:56,679 --> 01:38:57,676
Thank you.

1519
01:38:57,756 --> 01:38:58,922
Congratulations.

1520
01:38:59,002 --> 01:39:00,191
Thank you very much.

1521
01:41:44,883 --> 01:41:47,469
Hello, good evening.

1522
01:41:47,908 --> 01:41:49,481
I am Rishi Kapoor...

1523
01:41:49,691 --> 01:41:54,422
welcoming all of you
to India News’ special program.

1524
01:41:55,408 --> 01:41:56,748
As you all know...

1525
01:41:57,269 --> 01:42:00,222
Kanta Ben school dismissed
two of their teachers...

1526
01:42:00,427 --> 01:42:03,313
Mrs. Vidya Sawant
and Mrs. Jyoti Thakur...

1527
01:42:03,511 --> 01:42:07,423
calling them
outdated and incapable.

1528
01:42:07,795 --> 01:42:10,046
And this quiz contest
has been organized...

1529
01:42:10,126 --> 01:42:11,821
to test their capability.

1530
01:42:12,048 --> 01:42:14,425
And you’re watching
it being telecast live.

1531
01:42:14,567 --> 01:42:16,344
Papa, mom’s on television.

1532
01:42:16,517 --> 01:42:18,582
They will be asked 10 questions...

1533
01:42:18,755 --> 01:42:21,223
which has been set by
the Principal Kamini Gupta...

1534
01:42:21,423 --> 01:42:23,121
and a neutral panel.

1535
01:42:23,697 --> 01:42:26,121
The question can be on any topic...

1536
01:42:26,495 --> 01:42:28,905
and the prize money is huge.

1537
01:42:29,463 --> 01:42:31,531
50 million rupees.

1538
01:42:31,835 --> 01:42:33,438
50 million.

1539
01:42:33,877 --> 01:42:35,538
50 million.

1540
01:42:36,202 --> 01:42:38,106
50 million.

1541
01:42:38,803 --> 01:42:43,375
Yes... if they answer
all 10 questions correctly...

1542
01:42:43,679 --> 01:42:47,169
then you will
give them 50 million...

1543
01:42:47,638 --> 01:42:50,438
re-instate them
in your school, and...

1544
01:42:50,655 --> 01:42:53,057
publicly apologise to them.

1545
01:42:53,568 --> 01:42:55,202
Do you two accept?

1546
01:42:57,550 --> 01:42:58,893
Yes, I know.

1547
01:42:59,124 --> 01:43:00,263
Agreement, please.

1548
01:43:06,406 --> 01:43:08,728
Mansukh bhai, what is this loot?

1549
01:43:09,212 --> 01:43:11,135
This is no loot, Prem bhai.

1550
01:43:11,813 --> 01:43:13,378
The prize money is just a bait...

1551
01:43:13,612 --> 01:43:15,575
which these fishes have taken.

1552
01:43:16,842 --> 01:43:21,692
Vidya and Jyoti,
if you lose this contest...

1553
01:43:22,121 --> 01:43:24,675
then your teaching
career will be over forever.

1554
01:43:24,944 --> 01:43:27,035
And do you agree, that if you lose...

1555
01:43:27,634 --> 01:43:29,223
then you will never teach again?

1556
01:43:29,529 --> 01:43:30,610
Do you accept?

1557
01:43:39,634 --> 01:43:40,520
Yes.

1558
01:43:40,737 --> 01:43:43,512
Every question in this
contest has a winning amount.

1559
01:43:43,666 --> 01:43:45,509
The more right answers
they will give...

1560
01:43:45,589 --> 01:43:46,947
the amount will keep increasing.

1561
01:43:47,086 --> 01:43:49,230
If at any stage,
they don’t know the answer...

1562
01:43:49,374 --> 01:43:51,894
they can collect the
amount they won and quit the game.

1563
01:43:52,049 --> 01:43:55,923
But... but that will mean you lost.

1564
01:43:56,767 --> 01:43:59,477
Because you’ve to score
hundred percent result.

1565
01:43:59,752 --> 01:44:02,043
All 10 right answers.

1566
01:44:02,724 --> 01:44:04,100
You do accept?

1567
01:44:05,247 --> 01:44:05,730
Yes.

1568
01:44:05,810 --> 01:44:07,623
Good. Agreement, please.

1569
01:44:11,758 --> 01:44:13,564
What’s this?

1570
01:44:13,769 --> 01:44:16,733
I was giving them one million each.

1571
01:44:16,986 --> 01:44:18,791
Sir, your method wasn’t straight.

1572
01:44:25,230 --> 01:44:28,072
Whatever they win today,
will be on their own merit.

1573
01:44:28,599 --> 01:44:29,470
Yeah...

1574
01:44:29,625 --> 01:44:30,773
So let’s begin.

1575
01:44:31,065 --> 01:44:34,261
You’ll get one minute
to answer every question.

1576
01:44:34,523 --> 01:44:36,183
You also have a lifeline...

1577
01:44:36,322 --> 01:44:39,065
and I’ll tell you
about it when you need it.

1578
01:44:39,247 --> 01:44:40,235
So let’s start...

1579
01:44:40,315 --> 01:44:43,195
First question for 10,000 rupees.

1580
01:44:45,687 --> 01:44:49,225
When was our National
Anthem “Jana Gana Mana”...

1581
01:44:49,378 --> 01:44:51,700
sung for the first time?

1582
01:44:52,363 --> 01:44:53,180
Options are...

1583
01:44:53,260 --> 01:44:55,723
A.)	1915.

1584
01:44:56,100 --> 01:44:58,104
B.)	1911.

1585
01:44:58,396 --> 01:45:00,332
C.)	1942.

1586
01:45:00,554 --> 01:45:02,695
D.) 1947.

1587
01:45:03,714 --> 01:45:05,841
And your time starts now.

1588
01:45:06,700 --> 01:45:08,544
B.) 1911.

1589
01:45:08,690 --> 01:45:10,976
It was sung for the
first time in 1911...

1590
01:45:11,137 --> 01:45:14,763
during the Indian National
Congress’ Kolkata session.

1591
01:45:14,942 --> 01:45:16,785
Original, in Bengali.

1592
01:45:17,530 --> 01:45:22,013
And it was officially adopted
in the Constituent assembly...

1593
01:45:22,436 --> 01:45:25,275
on 24th of January, 1950.

1594
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:27,546
As our National Anthem!

1595
01:45:28,794 --> 01:45:30,084
Yes, you’re right!

1596
01:45:30,164 --> 01:45:31,359
1911!

1597
01:45:39,613 --> 01:45:41,841
Second question for 20,000.

1598
01:45:44,017 --> 01:45:47,119
In the Sikh religion,
the names of the boys...

1599
01:45:47,335 --> 01:45:48,443
are associated with Singh.

1600
01:45:48,590 --> 01:45:51,038
Like Navjot Singh... Surjeet Singh.

1601
01:45:51,454 --> 01:45:53,792
And the girl’s names are
always associated with Kaur.

1602
01:45:53,947 --> 01:45:55,966
Like Navjot Kaur, Sujit Kaur.

1603
01:45:56,300 --> 01:45:58,796
The literary meaning
of Singh is ‘Sher’ (Lion).

1604
01:45:59,476 --> 01:46:01,519
What is the literary
meaning of ‘Kaur’?

1605
01:46:01,796 --> 01:46:03,944
A.) Sherni (Lioness)

1606
01:46:04,265 --> 01:46:06,274
B.) Student.

1607
01:46:06,474 --> 01:46:08,898
C.) Daughter. Or...

1608
01:46:08,978 --> 01:46:11,046
D.) Princess.

1609
01:46:11,837 --> 01:46:14,256
And your time begins now.

1610
01:46:14,771 --> 01:46:16,879
I think its Student.

1611
01:46:17,501 --> 01:46:18,957
Disciples.

1612
01:46:19,250 --> 01:46:21,448
Sikh disciples of Gurunanakji.

1613
01:46:21,636 --> 01:46:23,009
It should be Student.

1614
01:46:23,148 --> 01:46:26,399
Look, the meaning of Sikh is disciple,
but not Kaur.

1615
01:46:26,636 --> 01:46:28,324
We had a Sikh family friend...

1616
01:46:28,404 --> 01:46:30,616
and his daughter’s
name was Jeet Kaur.

1617
01:46:30,744 --> 01:46:33,644
He always called her
‘Princess of Victory’.

1618
01:46:33,771 --> 01:46:35,050
Victory means Jeet.

1619
01:46:35,642 --> 01:46:37,829
So Kaur would mean Princess.

1620
01:46:38,893 --> 01:46:40,644
- But...
- Just trust me.

1621
01:46:40,724 --> 01:46:42,021
Trust me.

1622
01:46:43,136 --> 01:46:46,477
Sir, it is D. Princess.

1623
01:46:56,742 --> 01:47:00,867
Jyoti... if you had said Student...

1624
01:47:01,405 --> 01:47:02,624
It would’ve been wrong.

1625
01:47:02,704 --> 01:47:03,486
She’s right.

1626
01:47:03,566 --> 01:47:05,905
It’s the right answer.
Princess.

1627
01:47:10,178 --> 01:47:12,880
Third question for 50,000 rupees.

1628
01:47:13,376 --> 01:47:14,390
The question is...

1629
01:47:14,810 --> 01:47:17,832
Only one personnel
in the Indian Air Force...

1630
01:47:18,049 --> 01:47:20,346
has been felicitated
with the Param Veer Chakra.

1631
01:47:20,495 --> 01:47:21,791
Tell us his name.

1632
01:47:22,207 --> 01:47:23,496
Your options are.

1633
01:47:23,629 --> 01:47:26,092
A.) Wing Commander MS Bawa.

1634
01:47:26,172 --> 01:47:29,214
B.) Flying officer
Nirmal Jeet Singh Seikho.

1635
01:47:29,414 --> 01:47:31,795
C.) Group Captain Arjun Singh.

1636
01:47:31,922 --> 01:47:35,199
D.) Squadron Leader RK Sharma.

1637
01:47:35,337 --> 01:47:36,942
And your time begins now.

1638
01:47:37,022 --> 01:47:38,337
1971 war.

1639
01:47:38,417 --> 01:47:39,920
Nirmal Jeet Singh Seikho.

1640
01:47:40,390 --> 01:47:43,717
He shot down three planes
and then attained martyrdom.

1641
01:47:43,878 --> 01:47:45,062
I am pretty sure.

1642
01:47:45,142 --> 01:47:46,242
- Should I?
- Okay.

1643
01:47:47,587 --> 01:47:51,777
Option B. Flying officer
Nirmal Jeet Singh Seikho.

1644
01:47:58,672 --> 01:48:00,300
You’re absolutely right.

1645
01:48:00,803 --> 01:48:05,475
The correct answer B.
Flying officer Nirmal Jeet Singh Seikho.

1646
01:48:06,487 --> 01:48:09,082
And let me tell you, our government...

1647
01:48:09,162 --> 01:48:12,465
even issued a postal
stamp in his honour.

1648
01:48:16,505 --> 01:48:17,747
Let’s move ahead.

1649
01:48:18,718 --> 01:48:21,238
Now you won’t get any
options to your questions.

1650
01:48:21,407 --> 01:48:22,394
- Okay.
- Yes.

1651
01:48:22,474 --> 01:48:23,185
Good.

1652
01:48:24,002 --> 01:48:27,603
Fourth question for 100,000 rupees.

1653
01:48:28,919 --> 01:48:30,756
Describe this picture.

1654
01:48:36,117 --> 01:48:38,092
This is India’s first rocket.

1655
01:48:38,233 --> 01:48:39,617
Nike Apache.

1656
01:48:39,918 --> 01:48:43,914
ISRO launched it in 1963, in Kerala.

1657
01:48:44,257 --> 01:48:47,063
From the Thumba
equatorial Launch station.

1658
01:48:47,257 --> 01:48:50,695
And interestingly...
our first rocket...

1659
01:48:50,924 --> 01:48:52,444
was carried on a cycle.

1660
01:48:52,627 --> 01:48:54,730
Because there was only
one launch-pad in the station...

1661
01:48:54,864 --> 01:48:58,611
and the road was
through dense coconut trees.

1662
01:48:59,181 --> 01:49:00,753
And they are right.

1663
01:49:04,792 --> 01:49:05,926
Sir, one more thing.

1664
01:49:06,764 --> 01:49:09,042
The people who worked
on this rocket...

1665
01:49:09,177 --> 01:49:13,959
also included our former
President Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam.

1666
01:49:14,787 --> 01:49:18,989
Surprising...
this fact isn’t mentioned here.

1667
01:49:19,109 --> 01:49:20,840
And their general knowledge...

1668
01:49:20,920 --> 01:49:23,235
is better than those
who set the questions.

1669
01:49:23,369 --> 01:49:24,494
Right, sir.

1670
01:49:24,627 --> 01:49:25,791
Let’s move ahead.

1671
01:49:26,208 --> 01:49:29,719
Fifth question... for 500,000.

1672
01:49:31,980 --> 01:49:34,656
Dalai Lama, we all know.

1673
01:49:35,173 --> 01:49:40,113
But what does the words
‘Dalai’ and ‘Lama’ mean?

1674
01:49:40,495 --> 01:49:42,847
And your time starts now...

1675
01:49:44,165 --> 01:49:46,506
‘Dalai’ is a Mongolian word...

1676
01:49:46,758 --> 01:49:50,385
and it means vast, like the ocean.

1677
01:49:50,547 --> 01:49:53,040
And in the Tibetan language...

1678
01:49:53,271 --> 01:49:56,023
the spiritual leaders
were called ‘Lama’.

1679
01:49:56,148 --> 01:49:58,610
So those who are on this post...

1680
01:49:58,805 --> 01:50:05,433
are believed to be
the ‘Ocean of Compassion’.

1681
01:50:16,584 --> 01:50:19,768
Right now you two look like
the ocean of knowledge to me...

1682
01:50:19,848 --> 01:50:22,930
because this is the
absolutely right answer.

1683
01:50:23,408 --> 01:50:24,459
Yes!

1684
01:50:24,896 --> 01:50:27,705
The Kanta Ben High School teachers...

1685
01:50:27,898 --> 01:50:30,749
are performing amazingly.

1686
01:50:32,438 --> 01:50:34,377
Congratulations, good going.

1687
01:50:34,721 --> 01:50:36,111
Wow!

1688
01:50:38,111 --> 01:50:41,807
Sixth question,
for the prize money one million.

1689
01:50:43,385 --> 01:50:44,652
Watch this video.

1690
01:50:49,129 --> 01:50:52,097
That mister wearing the glasses,
who’s dancing...

1691
01:50:52,235 --> 01:50:53,084
who is he?

1692
01:50:53,164 --> 01:50:54,496
Identify him.

1693
01:50:54,851 --> 01:50:57,428
And your time starts now.

1694
01:50:58,948 --> 01:51:01,702
I’ve heard that Jyoti
is a good dancer.

1695
01:51:01,992 --> 01:51:03,774
And you put in a question about dance.

1696
01:51:04,220 --> 01:51:04,899
Relax.

1697
01:51:04,979 --> 01:51:06,559
This is some foreign film.

1698
01:51:06,639 --> 01:51:07,392
I...

1699
01:51:08,362 --> 01:51:10,031
I’ve seen this.

1700
01:51:16,879 --> 01:51:17,560
Yeah...

1701
01:51:17,687 --> 01:51:19,325
Sir, this is Bruce Lee.

1702
01:51:19,498 --> 01:51:20,908
- Bruce Lee...
- Yes.

1703
01:51:21,478 --> 01:51:23,113
Bruce Lee... you mean the fighter...

1704
01:51:23,193 --> 01:51:25,202
from Fist of Fury,
Enter the Dragon?

1705
01:51:25,282 --> 01:51:26,259
Yes, sir.

1706
01:51:26,408 --> 01:51:27,577
He’s this dancer?

1707
01:51:27,657 --> 01:51:29,685
No... I don’t believe it.

1708
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:31,311
I know...

1709
01:51:31,514 --> 01:51:33,507
Sir, this is Bruce Lee.

1710
01:51:33,780 --> 01:51:36,886
My husband is a die-hard
fan of Bruce Lee...

1711
01:51:36,966 --> 01:51:38,414
and I am a fan of dance.

1712
01:51:38,815 --> 01:51:42,665
And very few people that
the King of Martial Arts...

1713
01:51:42,745 --> 01:51:45,097
Bruce Lee was a trained dancer.

1714
01:51:45,294 --> 01:51:48,573
Before he became a star,
he used to teach ‘Cha-Cha-Cha’.

1715
01:51:48,829 --> 01:51:50,199
‘Cha-Cha-Cha’?

1716
01:51:50,388 --> 01:51:51,354
I don’t believe it.

1717
01:51:51,434 --> 01:51:53,997
But since you’re so confident,
then let’s see.

1718
01:51:54,319 --> 01:51:55,792
What's written?

1719
01:51:56,668 --> 01:51:58,721
Oh my, God. You’re absolutely right.

1720
01:51:59,168 --> 01:52:02,149
You’ve won one million rupees.

1721
01:52:04,484 --> 01:52:06,854
She recognised Bruce Lee too.

1722
01:52:07,874 --> 01:52:09,276
Not me.

1723
01:52:10,183 --> 01:52:11,822
Wait for the next question.

1724
01:52:12,048 --> 01:52:14,441
Seventh question, 5 million.

1725
01:52:14,649 --> 01:52:16,122
For 5 million rupees.

1726
01:52:16,202 --> 01:52:17,130
And that is...

1727
01:52:18,714 --> 01:52:22,527
Yahoo... the web portal.

1728
01:52:22,994 --> 01:52:26,600
Yahoo... What’s its full form?

1729
01:52:27,518 --> 01:52:29,085
Yahoo has a full form?

1730
01:52:30,441 --> 01:52:31,886
That’s a good question.

1731
01:52:33,157 --> 01:52:34,310
Well, obviously.

1732
01:52:34,390 --> 01:52:36,026
What’s the full form of Yahoo?

1733
01:52:36,189 --> 01:52:38,279
- And your time starts now.
- Should I?

1734
01:52:39,683 --> 01:52:41,172
Well, audience...

1735
01:52:41,410 --> 01:52:44,631
Y A H O O.

1736
01:52:44,775 --> 01:52:45,810
So...

1737
01:52:46,030 --> 01:52:49,525
Officious Oracle...

1738
01:52:51,590 --> 01:52:52,769
H...

1739
01:52:54,210 --> 01:52:55,541
Hierarchical...

1740
01:52:56,076 --> 01:52:59,706
Hierarchical...

1741
01:53:03,611 --> 01:53:08,094
Yet Another Hierarchical
Officious Oracle.

1742
01:53:13,304 --> 01:53:14,519
Oh, God!

1743
01:53:16,686 --> 01:53:18,044
She’s right!

1744
01:53:19,939 --> 01:53:21,293
They’ve done it.

1745
01:53:22,684 --> 01:53:25,142
Wonderful! Wonderful!

1746
01:53:25,788 --> 01:53:28,518
By the way,
I didn’t know Yahoo had a full form.

1747
01:53:28,694 --> 01:53:30,305
Does Google have a full form too?

1748
01:53:30,451 --> 01:53:32,093
Yes, sir. They do.

1749
01:53:32,173 --> 01:53:33,162
Really?

1750
01:53:33,242 --> 01:53:34,518
GOOGLE

1751
01:53:35,892 --> 01:53:41,780
Global Organization Of
Oriented Group Language of Earth.

1752
01:53:43,085 --> 01:53:46,146
Oh my God, this is incredible.

1753
01:53:46,510 --> 01:53:48,258
These teachers aren’t outdated...

1754
01:53:48,338 --> 01:53:49,710
In fact, they’re outstanding.

1755
01:53:49,790 --> 01:53:51,092
Outstanding!

1756
01:53:57,245 --> 01:54:01,369
Now the eight question
for ten million.

1757
01:54:02,598 --> 01:54:06,384
Teachers. Ready for ten million.

1758
01:54:11,326 --> 01:54:12,577
The question...

1759
01:54:13,635 --> 01:54:16,286
Who designed the first petrol car?

1760
01:54:17,747 --> 01:54:21,963
Who designed the first petrol car?

1761
01:54:22,372 --> 01:54:25,247
Who designed the first
petrol car and when?

1762
01:54:25,374 --> 01:54:26,376
When?

1763
01:54:27,153 --> 01:54:29,217
Your time starts now.

1764
01:55:17,460 --> 01:55:19,416
Karl Benz, 1886.

1765
01:55:21,863 --> 01:55:24,562
Karl Benz, 1886!

1766
01:55:30,777 --> 01:55:31,768
Absolutely correct.

1767
01:55:31,892 --> 01:55:33,130
Absolutely correct.

1768
01:55:34,381 --> 01:55:35,842
Yes!

1769
01:55:37,311 --> 01:55:38,477
Oh, God!

1770
01:55:38,615 --> 01:55:39,534
Wow!

1771
01:55:40,024 --> 01:55:40,970
Wow!

1772
01:55:46,922 --> 01:55:50,044
You’ve won 10 million rupees.

1773
01:55:55,654 --> 01:55:57,823
Seems like the excitement
amongst the people is growing...

1774
01:55:57,903 --> 01:55:59,603
along with my heart beat.

1775
01:56:01,684 --> 01:56:04,423
Because this is my first show.

1776
01:56:04,630 --> 01:56:07,343
Next question for 20 million.

1777
01:56:07,642 --> 01:56:08,867
20 million.

1778
01:56:09,593 --> 01:56:10,638
Teachers.

1779
01:56:10,795 --> 01:56:13,677
When Christopher Columbus
and Vasco Da Gama...

1780
01:56:14,276 --> 01:56:19,525
set out to explore the world,
they followed certain maps.

1781
01:56:20,933 --> 01:56:23,081
Who made those maps?

1782
01:56:25,056 --> 01:56:27,288
Your time starts now.

1783
01:57:09,956 --> 01:57:12,296
- We need a helpline.
- Stop the clock.

1784
01:57:14,914 --> 01:57:16,259
They’re done for.

1785
01:57:17,299 --> 01:57:18,838
Your helpline is...

1786
01:57:19,308 --> 01:57:24,527
you can take the help
of any one teacher sitting here.

1787
01:57:25,085 --> 01:57:29,237
If her answer is right,
you will win 20 million.

1788
01:57:29,525 --> 01:57:30,932
And the game will continue.

1789
01:57:31,126 --> 01:57:35,890
But if their answer is wrong,
then it’ll be game over.

1790
01:57:36,156 --> 01:57:39,266
And you will also lose
all the money that you won.

1791
01:57:40,325 --> 01:57:43,149
So would you like
to use the helpline...

1792
01:57:43,418 --> 01:57:46,864
or take the 10 million
and quit this game?

1793
01:57:48,209 --> 01:57:50,944
It's 10 million... take it.

1794
01:57:51,132 --> 01:57:51,788
Right?

1795
01:57:51,868 --> 01:57:53,135
Not again, sir.

1796
01:57:53,357 --> 01:57:55,223
What about their self-respect then?

1797
01:57:55,361 --> 01:57:56,876
Forget about self-respect.

1798
01:57:56,956 --> 01:57:59,037
10 million... they’re
getting the money.

1799
01:57:59,192 --> 01:58:03,465
I swear... sir would’ve
definitely taken it, right sir?

1800
01:58:05,976 --> 01:58:08,468
They are not politicians,
they are teachers.

1801
01:58:08,701 --> 01:58:09,841
They will play ahead.

1802
01:58:09,996 --> 01:58:11,054
Quiet.

1803
01:58:14,972 --> 01:58:17,380
- We’ll play, sir.
- Good show.

1804
01:58:17,552 --> 01:58:20,373
So... which teacher’s
help would you like to take...

1805
01:58:20,453 --> 01:58:22,508
from the teacher’s section?

1806
01:58:33,541 --> 01:58:35,250
Mrs. Indu Shashtri.

1807
01:58:35,996 --> 01:58:39,668
Our contestants have chosen
Mrs. Indu Shashtri...

1808
01:58:39,882 --> 01:58:41,291
to give the answer.

1809
01:58:41,693 --> 01:58:43,436
Mrs. Indu Shashtri Please.

1810
01:58:47,454 --> 01:58:49,599
Mrs. Indu Shashtri Please.

1811
01:58:50,961 --> 01:58:52,146
Aah, there.

1812
01:58:59,588 --> 01:59:01,414
I’ll repeat the question for you.

1813
01:59:01,851 --> 01:59:04,276
When Christopher Columbus
and Vasco Da Gama...

1814
01:59:04,503 --> 01:59:09,312
set out to explore the world,
they followed certain maps.

1815
01:59:09,566 --> 01:59:11,754
Who made those maps?

1816
01:59:13,853 --> 01:59:19,592
These maps were made by
Arab Scholar... Mohammad Al Idrisi.

1817
01:59:20,130 --> 01:59:21,605
There was one thing special about him.

1818
01:59:21,793 --> 01:59:24,193
He used to make all
his maps upside down.

1819
01:59:24,273 --> 01:59:27,936
Meaning, North below...
and South above.

1820
01:59:28,573 --> 01:59:31,793
And people used to
read his maps upside down.

1821
01:59:38,630 --> 01:59:42,345
Were you fired from
Kanta Ben school as well?

1822
01:59:46,297 --> 01:59:47,962
You’re a great assessor.

1823
01:59:48,144 --> 01:59:49,182
Thank you.

1824
01:59:49,574 --> 01:59:50,863
Very intelligent.

1825
01:59:51,113 --> 01:59:53,051
You two are simply wonderful.

1826
01:59:53,471 --> 01:59:56,475
Because what she’s
saying is absolutely right.

1827
01:59:56,640 --> 01:59:58,252
You’re absolutely right.

1828
01:59:58,394 --> 02:00:00,427
You’ve won 20 million rupees.

1829
02:00:06,056 --> 02:00:09,048
Thank you, Mrs. Shashtri.
Thank you very much.

1830
02:00:22,811 --> 02:00:24,737
Ladies and Gentlemen...

1831
02:00:25,069 --> 02:00:28,331
the last question of this contest.

1832
02:00:30,953 --> 02:00:32,447
The defining question.

1833
02:00:32,640 --> 02:00:34,174
Pass or fail.

1834
02:00:34,428 --> 02:00:35,386
Are you ready?

1835
02:00:37,350 --> 02:00:41,652
Prize money for 50 million!

1836
02:00:44,270 --> 02:00:48,405
This is your question...
for 50 million.

1837
02:00:50,186 --> 02:00:52,213
In the Sri Hanuman Chalisa...

1838
02:00:53,015 --> 02:00:57,156
Tulsidas has revealed
a secret of the universe.

1839
02:00:57,404 --> 02:00:58,998
A secret.

1840
02:00:59,078 --> 02:01:00,228
What is that?

1841
02:01:00,580 --> 02:01:02,117
This is the last
question of the evening.

1842
02:01:02,197 --> 02:01:04,020
So... there’s no time limit...

1843
02:01:04,100 --> 02:01:05,499
You can take your own time.

1844
02:01:05,579 --> 02:01:07,076
Let me repeat.

1845
02:01:07,558 --> 02:01:09,400
In the Sri Hanuman Chalisa...

1846
02:01:09,480 --> 02:01:13,593
Tulsidas has revealed
a secret of the universe.

1847
02:01:14,141 --> 02:01:16,327
You’ve to tell us what that secret is.

1848
02:01:49,720 --> 02:01:52,782
"Yug shehastra yojan par bhanu"

1849
02:01:53,318 --> 02:01:56,328
"Lilyo taahir madhur fal jaanu"

1850
02:01:57,729 --> 02:02:00,488
"Yug shehastra yojan par bhanu"

1851
02:02:01,128 --> 02:02:04,225
"Lilyo taahir madhur fal jaanu"

1852
02:02:12,676 --> 02:02:16,849
One ‘Yug’ means 12000 years.

1853
02:02:17,728 --> 02:02:21,263
One ‘Shehestra’ means 1000 years.

1854
02:02:21,837 --> 02:02:24,895
One ‘Yojan’ means 8 miles.

1855
02:02:25,502 --> 02:02:27,407
Let’s multiply the three.

1856
02:02:27,941 --> 02:02:37,196
12000*1000*8 = 9,60,00,000 miles.

1857
02:02:37,722 --> 02:02:40,379
1 mile = 1.6 kilometre.

1858
02:02:41,079 --> 02:02:43,431
So when we multiply them...

1859
02:02:45,438 --> 02:02:50,912
We get... 15,36,00,000 kilometres.

1860
02:02:51,742 --> 02:02:53,749
And ‘Bhanu’ means the sun.

1861
02:02:56,059 --> 02:02:57,824
The distance between
the earth and the sun...

1862
02:02:58,052 --> 02:03:01,701
which the world scientist
calculated in the 18th century...

1863
02:03:02,033 --> 02:03:05,331
Tulsidas had already denoted
that in the 16th century...

1864
02:03:05,507 --> 02:03:07,356
in the Sri Hanuman Chalisa.

1865
02:03:30,188 --> 02:03:31,764
You win 50 million.

1866
02:03:34,189 --> 02:03:36,788
You’re the winners.

1867
02:03:36,953 --> 02:03:38,025
Yeah!

1868
02:03:39,157 --> 02:03:40,256
Bravo!

1869
02:03:45,799 --> 02:03:48,676
Incredible India! Incredible teachers!

1870
02:03:49,007 --> 02:03:50,547
Please clap for them.

1871
02:03:51,172 --> 02:03:52,129
Brilliant.

1872
02:03:52,453 --> 02:03:54,476
Vidya, Jyoti... please come here.

1873
02:03:54,636 --> 02:03:55,937
End of judgement.

1874
02:03:56,124 --> 02:04:01,619
It is Vidya Sawant and
Mrs. Jyoti Thakur, the winners.

1875
02:04:04,276 --> 02:04:06,741
Ladies and Gentlemen, the winners...

1876
02:04:06,886 --> 02:04:08,981
of India News’
special quiz program..

1877
02:04:09,121 --> 02:04:13,032
Mrs. Vidya Sawant and
Mrs. Jyoti Thakur.

1878
02:04:14,595 --> 02:04:15,460
See, sir.

1879
02:04:16,131 --> 02:04:19,521
Today these two teachers
shook up your Nagrik Shashtra.

1880
02:04:19,978 --> 02:04:20,960
Yes...

1881
02:04:22,629 --> 02:04:23,694
It’s alright.

1882
02:04:24,330 --> 02:04:26,379
Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant!

1883
02:04:26,627 --> 02:04:28,028
I salute.

1884
02:04:28,433 --> 02:04:30,369
I salute these teachers.

1885
02:04:36,560 --> 02:04:38,882
Wonderful. Brilliant.

1886
02:04:41,622 --> 02:04:45,642
Mr. Anmol Parekh,
did you bring your cheque book along?

1887
02:04:46,012 --> 02:04:48,988
Or were you too over confident
that you are going to win?

1888
02:04:50,647 --> 02:04:52,656
Listen, you can have
this discussion later.

1889
02:04:52,736 --> 02:04:56,399
I’ll be really grateful if
you write that cheque for 50 million.

1890
02:04:56,609 --> 02:04:57,910
Clap please.

1891
02:04:59,929 --> 02:05:01,389
Thank you. Yes.

1892
02:05:07,861 --> 02:05:09,937
Congratulations, Mr. Parekh.

1893
02:05:11,428 --> 02:05:14,217
Your school has actually
become really famous today.

1894
02:05:14,853 --> 02:05:15,755
Thank you.

1895
02:05:17,239 --> 02:05:22,121
And you remember that you’ve
reinstate these two in your school.

1896
02:05:22,398 --> 02:05:24,075
- Remember?
- Yes.

1897
02:05:24,390 --> 02:05:26,435
Good show. Good show.

1898
02:05:27,504 --> 02:05:29,998
This is for you two, the prize money.

1899
02:05:30,676 --> 02:05:32,335
Wonderful. Well deserved.

1900
02:05:40,809 --> 02:05:41,887
Excuse me.

1901
02:05:43,528 --> 02:05:44,718
Madam.

1902
02:05:45,864 --> 02:05:47,972
I think you’re forgetting something.

1903
02:05:48,304 --> 02:05:51,579
You had to apologise
to them in front of everyone.

1904
02:05:51,751 --> 02:05:52,744
Please.

1905
02:05:54,519 --> 02:05:55,438
No, I thing you didn’t hear that.

1906
02:05:55,518 --> 02:05:56,531
Hello.

1907
02:05:56,730 --> 02:06:00,265
You have to apologise to them.

1908
02:06:00,636 --> 02:06:02,549
Can you hear me at the back?

1909
02:06:02,629 --> 02:06:03,742
Hello. Hello.

1910
02:06:03,875 --> 02:06:06,288
You have to apologise to them.

1911
02:06:06,414 --> 02:06:08,298
Apologise. Sorry.

1912
02:06:09,526 --> 02:06:10,988
I am sorry.

1913
02:06:15,305 --> 02:06:16,329
Clap.

1914
02:06:25,835 --> 02:06:29,215
Today’s special program
on India News has created history.

1915
02:06:29,656 --> 02:06:30,708
Two teachers...

1916
02:06:31,172 --> 02:06:35,205
On the basis of their knowledge
won 50 million rupees.

1917
02:06:35,285 --> 02:06:36,817
Bravo.
Very good.

1918
02:06:40,892 --> 02:06:44,445
So Vidya, Jyoti... you’ve
won such a huge amount.

1919
02:06:44,850 --> 02:06:46,769
You can now live comfortably.

1920
02:06:47,959 --> 02:06:50,650
There’s no rest.
Our real work begins now.

1921
02:06:51,630 --> 02:06:53,475
We still have to build that school...

1922
02:06:53,660 --> 02:06:56,431
which Dr. Radha Krishnan
always dreamed about.

1923
02:06:56,942 --> 02:06:59,822
Where... education isn’t business.

1924
02:07:00,118 --> 02:07:02,481
The parents don’t
have to worry about...

1925
02:07:02,561 --> 02:07:04,081
the inappropriate huge school fee.

1926
02:07:04,824 --> 02:07:07,875
And no Nusrat’s Iqbal...

1927
02:07:08,216 --> 02:07:10,157
is ever dismissed from school.

1928
02:07:11,434 --> 02:07:14,325
And where no Chaturvedi,
Manjeet or Pinto...

1929
02:07:14,405 --> 02:07:15,935
have tears in their eyes.

1930
02:07:19,316 --> 02:07:23,595
And now we’ll build that
school... with this money.

1931
02:07:24,872 --> 02:07:28,052
I see... so you’ll build a school.

1932
02:07:28,639 --> 02:07:31,290
- Not us...
- Our Shashtri ma’am.

1933
02:07:32,407 --> 02:07:33,813
Shashtri ma’am.

1934
02:07:35,129 --> 02:07:36,441
And you two?

1935
02:07:37,802 --> 02:07:38,702
The same old...

1936
02:07:38,961 --> 02:07:40,645
Chalk and Duster.

1937
02:07:54,746 --> 02:07:59,834
‘The Chalk and Duster
team salute all teachers...’

1938
02:07:59,914 --> 02:08:01,616
‘and thank them.’

1939
02:08:01,884 --> 02:08:07,238
<i>“We’re the lamps of education”</i>

1940
02:08:07,678 --> 02:08:10,825
<i>"We will shine..."</i>

1941
02:08:11,549 --> 02:08:15,906
<i>“We’ll shine in the world”</i>

1942
02:08:21,330 --> 02:08:25,412
<i>“All the darkness around...”</i>

1943
02:08:27,315 --> 02:08:30,636
