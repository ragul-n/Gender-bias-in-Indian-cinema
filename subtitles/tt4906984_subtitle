1
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:44,434
Oh..Hi, Ivlanoj.

2
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:51,465
Ivlanoj, are you sure
you want to do this?

3
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:53,403
Think again!

4
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,103
This can even go against you.
- So?

5
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:57,815
What difference does that make?

6
00:03:58,472 --> 00:03:59,678
Come on, clip it on.

7
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:05,449
One has to get in the filth,
in order to clean it.

8
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:08,056
Your clothes
are bound to get dirty.

9
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:10,424
People have a right to knovv..

10
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:13,359
..about everything that happens
in India in the name of Cricket.

11
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:14,290
Understand?

12
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:15,162
Sit.

13
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:19,531
Don't vvorry.

14
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:22,264
Once you switch this camera on..

15
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,297
..consider it the
end of his..innings.

16
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:29,005
So we're back live, and
Azhar is playing his 99th Test match!

17
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,681
Azhar! Azhar! Azhar!

18
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:34,677
‘I am Azhar.‘

19
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,550
‘Famous for three things.‘

20
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,348
‘First, I believe in God.‘

21
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:39,685
‘Married twice..'

22
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:43,626
Land scored three centuries
in my first three matches.‘

23
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:46,562
Azhar is just 1 run away
from scoring his century.

24
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,227
Can Allen stop Azhar
from completing his century?

25
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:51,358
Or not?

26
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:59,635
‘Crowd Cheering 'Azhar'."

27
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:03,604
What a wonderful
use of the wrist.

28
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,378
..as the ball races to
the boundary for a four.

29
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,177
So here Azhar completes his century..

30
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:12,018
..and Tony this is
what I call a comeback

31
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:14,991
The entire stadium is
giving Azhar a standing ovation

32
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:24,999
Move aside, move aside, clear the way.

33
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:29,135
Azhar sir, one autograph sir.

34
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:31,640
‘Everything was going perfect.‘

35
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,678
‘There was a time when I
was the Captain of India.‘

36
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,713
‘Or shall we say,
the son-in-law of India.‘

37
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,581
Azhar sir..!

38
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:45,049
‘Life was first class.

39
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,460
Brother Azhar, you are all alone?

40
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:50,620
Where's your wife Sangeeta?

41
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:51,719
She's shooting.

42
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:55,358
Wow, you're wearing
that nice expensive watch.

43
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,061
It shows the right time. - Really.

44
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:59,433
Also tells whether
your time's right or not!

45
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,233
I saw the same vvatch..ditto.

46
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,571
But it was beyond my budget, pal.

47
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:07,612
This was gifted by some fan.

48
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:10,038
We don't get such fans.

49
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,174
I became a commentaton.

50
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:14,279
..but you're still going strong.

51
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:17,513
You've already played 99 tests.

52
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,246
Soon you will play your 100!

53
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:20,347
And then?

54
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:22,616
When you're playing
for ‘Indian Team'..

55
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:24,189
..it's never enough.

56
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:27,127
Thank you.

57
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:28,723
Hello. - Hi Azhar.

58
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:30,533
Ajju, you are looking handsome.

59
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:34,231
Azhar sir, Nisha from Hindustan Times.

60
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:35,398
First I would like to
congratulate you for the century..

61
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:36,463
..you scored in your previous match.

62
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:37,098
Thank you.

63
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:40,576
Do you think you will be
appointed as the captain again.

64
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:43,012
..after your 99th match?

65
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:45,712
I don't perform out
there to become the captain.

66
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:47,546
I do it only to make India win.

67
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:51,086
Sir..sir..sir..
Excuse me sir.

68
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,454
Do you think it's
better to retire now?

69
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,524
I am still too young. Don't
start thinking about retirement yet.

70
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,061
My grandpa once said that
I'll play at least 100 test matches.

71
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,634
I must respect his feelings.

72
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:08,268
Azhar..the chairman's
called you immediately.

73
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,465
Let's go.

74
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,970
Well guys/the bosses are calling.

75
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,400
It's a long series.

76
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:16,139
We will continue this ne><t time.
- Sir..sir..

77
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:17,512
Come in.

78
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:20,047
Azhar, I have some bad news for you.

79
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:22,446
I don't know hovv to say this.

80
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:24,111
What's wrong, sir?

81
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,321
I thought you will
congratulate me for my century.

82
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:28,219
But things seem different here.

83
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,986
You've been accused
of match-fixing.

84
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,329
Azhar, Hansie has
given his statement.

85
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:35,991
..and he's clearly
said in his statement.

86
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:39,663
..that you introduced
him to IVIK Sharma, who is a bookie.

87
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:41,764
And..this is a serious allegation.

88
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:44,008
The Association cannot ignore it.

89
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:45,542
Read this.

90
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:48,307
This news is going
to spread like wildfire.

91
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:50,439
We will have to order an inquiry.

92
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:51,673
Sir, this is wrong.

93
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,716
I don't know any IVIK Sharma.

94
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:55,543
Come on, Azhar.
That's not the point.

95
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,281
150 players, 11 teams.

96
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,787
But he named you! Why?

97
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:00,581
Sir, I meet thousands
of people in the party!

98
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,957
They hug me,
shake hands..even take pictures.

99
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:04,427
Hovv would I know
if one of them is a bookie?

100
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:06,362
There's no point talking to him.

101
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,022
We must take action against him.

102
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:12,002
Azhar, I have a lot of
respect for you as a player.

103
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,728
So take my advice.

104
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:15,505
Hire a good lawyer.

105
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:18,042
Because this is going
to take a while to settle.

106
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,973
And until this
inquiry isn't over..

107
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:23,205
..the Association cannot
allow you to play cricket.

108
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:25,715
Sir..you've known
me for all these years.

109
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,076
Can I ever do a thing like this?

110
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:27,481
Tell me?

111
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,146
Azhar, I am sorry, there's
nothing more we can do for you.

112
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,154
But, sir..

113
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,084
Let's go.

114
00:08:57,671 --> 00:08:59,548
You are a strange guy.

115
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:02,678
You came to me saying
they offered 2.5 million.

116
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:03,477
Isn't it?

117
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:06,022
Who, sir? Azhar, right?

118
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:08,616
You told me this.
Hovv can you forget?

119
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:11,059
Cricketer ivianoj carries
out a sting operation.

120
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:13,563
The biggest e><pose in
the history of Indian Cricket.

121
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,497
There's a huge uproar
in the world of cricket.

122
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,034
But this Azhar..

123
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,732
It's hard to
lay hands on him.

124
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,298
We must fi>< him.

125
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,132
Tell me hovv do we do it?

126
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:25,504
He's a fraud.

127
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:30,274
Angry cricket fans burnt
effigies outside Azhar's home.

128
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,710
He had a locker, in Royal Hotel.

129
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:34,042
You mean Azhar?

130
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:36,417
I personally kept money
in it number of times.

131
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,250
Azhar paid 500,000 in cash.

132
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:39,619
..and bought a watch from Pappu.

133
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,454
I mean..who carries
that kind of cash?

134
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:44,086
On 15th June, Hansie said..

135
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,687
..that Azhar was one of the
guys who introduced him to a bookie.

136
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:48,192
The investigation
against Azhar..

137
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:50,029
..was ordered
after this statement.

138
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:52,569
Azhar was accused
of fi><ing three matches.

139
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:57,605
Number one, India Vs South Africa,
played in 1996, Jubilee Cup at Rajkot.

140
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:01,242
Second, India Vs Sri Lanka,
1998.

141
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:07,010
And third, the 1999 India
Vs Pakistan match played in Jaipur.

142
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:13,149

\/Ir. Azhar, we have orders
to search your house.

143
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:13,714
Here's the warrant.

144
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,199
The Chandrachur Committee.

145
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:32,504
..appointed to
investigate Azhar's ro
e..

146
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:36,637
..have stated in paragraph
no.153, of their 330 page report.

147
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:41,109
Azhar had close relations
with IVIK Sharma and other bookies.

148
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:43,345
And he was
involved in match-fixing.

149
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:44,353
I am in absolute shock!

150
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:46,546
I refuse to believe
Azhar could do this.

151
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,651
I've known him for many years,
this just seem impossible.

152
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,132
Azhar is a traitor.

153
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,770
He sold the country!

154
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:12,310
Azhar is a traitor.

155
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,678
‘My name..is Azhar.‘

156
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:20,715
‘I've been accused
of selling out my country.‘

157
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:47,444
‘Fans can make noise..and
make you sweat too.‘

158
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:48,815
It will be a bad
influence on the kids.

159
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:52,053
Everybody is complaining about me
to their Gods.

160
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,714
‘People would
turn around before also.‘

161
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,249
‘It's the same eyes.‘

162
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:56,760
‘But their view has changed.‘

163
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,295
Oh, that's Azhar.

164
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:01,696
But the person I have come to meet
willl never change.

165
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,528
Born and brought up in London,
but at heart is an Indian.

166
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:06,659
Hello, brother.

167
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:08,169
Rama.

168
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:13,671
Will definately look at me and say,
did we have to meet here?

169
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:16,378
Did we have to meet here?

170
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:19,149
My horoscope said "Be careful".

171
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:21,480
"
'

 have an
argument with someone."

172
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,043
You still read horoscopes?

173
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,180
You have changed, not me.

174
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:29,454
I get horoscopes at my home too,
but I don't read them.

175
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:31,627
I know what will
be written in them.

176
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,489
"Times are bad."

177
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:36,564
"Not all your
well-wishers will support you."

178
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,534
And today's color is "Black".

179
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:42,069
Black?

180
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:44,141
Brother, I need your black coat.

181
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:46,334
My black coat? Why?

182
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,179
I've decided..vve must
defend this. - We?

183
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:54,382
If I take up this case, people
will point fingers at me as well.

184
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,780
Please, don't involve me in this.

185
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:58,113
Even you think I am guilty.
- 
..

186
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:00,056
I don't know.

187
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,719
And I am not some
big-shot lawyer either.

188
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:08,299
Maybe..but you're an old friend.

189
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,368
Look, Azhar.
Go appoint some big lawyer.

190
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:15,167
You're rich, you can afford them.

191
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:18,602
Those who don't have many friends,
are not rich.

192
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:22,274
And what's the point
of finding the truth..

193
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:24,639
..when those few friends
are only against me.

194
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:25,705
So what's the point of fighting?

195
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:28,181
VVeIL.

196
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,747
Good bye.

197
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:44,534
Azhar!

198
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:47,295
Hovv many
times have I told you?

199
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,703
But you don't listen.

200
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:51,799
Every time it's the same thing.

201
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:54,067
Raja sir, you? Here?

202
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:57,248
Reddy, hovv are you? - Fine.

203
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:00,508
I came here to meet a
c
ient..but I met Azhar instead.

204
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:03,184
Strange man. Very strange man.

205
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:04,186
Vvhy?
What happened?

206
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:08,282
I said..
'


defend your case. - Yes.

207
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:09,654
I will get him acquitted.

208
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,719
But he questioned me instead.

209
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,457
"Are you sure I am not guilty?"

210
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:16,461
I told him, I don't care.

211
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:18,030
Whether you are or you're not.

212
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:23,537
But look at him, he tells me
he doesn't wants to fight this case.

213
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,102
There goes my free publicity

214
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:31,011
Even I cou
d've featured
on page 3 for a while.

215
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:33,046
We

..
'm getting late for a meeting.

216
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:34,146
Come on.

217
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:37,711
Azhar.

218
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:39,019
Azhar.

219
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:41,016
Where are you going
without your keys?

220
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:42,789
Here.

221
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,028
And why did you refuse Raja?

222
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,061
He's the top
lawyer in the country.

223
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:50,392
I don't want to win this case.

224
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,031
Won't make a difference if I lose.

225
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,264
What kind of a man are you?

226
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:56,637
Fevv minutes ago you wanted
me to defend your case.

227
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,373
What else do you want
to do other than win this case?

228
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:01,378
I want a clean image
more than a clean chit, Reddy.

229
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:03,976
I want to win their hearts again.

230
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:06,482
I want my country, my community back.

231
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:12,251
Because..
 cannot tolerate
the way people look at me.

232
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:16,026
Do 100 good deeds,
and no one remembers.

233
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,086
One wrong accusation
and they just disovvned me.

234
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:27,033
If you watch a movie
from the middle.

235
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,232
..it's hard to understand a thing.

236
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:32,475
Do one thing..revvind.

237
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,270
Tell me from the beginning.

238
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:37,438
You mean..you'

 take up my case?

239
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:43,020
It's tough!
Chances of winning are impossible!

240
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,419
But you see..
 watched
all your innings..

241
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:48,419
“so, I get to play one too.

242
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:52,161
Tell me from the beginning.

243
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,358
‘Prayer Call.‘

244
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:58,698
8th February, 1963. Hyderabad.

245
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:01,501
Congratulations. - Thank you.

246
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:03,404
Congratulations. - Thank you.

247
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:06,510
Congratulations. - Thank you.

248
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:07,610
Greetings.

249
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,660
His face glows with grace.

250
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,062
Suggest a name, father.

251
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:28,156
Azhar!

252
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:31,694
A child with such grace.

253
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:40,675
..wi

 shine a light on
our entire community, our country.

254
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:45,176
‘Grandparentscan usually
predict the future. '

255
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:48,642
‘When he said it
the first time, I didn't get it. '

256
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:51,084
‘When I held the bat
for the first time.‘

257
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,521
I didn't have a single clue.‘

258
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:53,522
‘But grandpa had faith.‘

259
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,616
He'll make our entire
community proud.

260
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,786
He'll play 100 test-matches.

261
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,062
Won't you, son?

262
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:02,164
Come..come on.

263
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:09,164
Hovv are you going to do it
in the last over, Azhar?

264
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,674
Partner, now that I've said it,
we'll do it.

265
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:17,104
Look Salim, Goliath is
trying to sound like the Giant!

266
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:21,312
No!

267
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:27,324
You must let your
game answer for you.

268
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:31,154
If you yell and scream,
only few people will listen.

269
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:37,494
But when your bat does the talking,
the whole world will have to listen.

270
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:42,138
You will play
100 matches for India.

271
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:43,433
Understood.

272
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,675
This bat will be your voice.

273
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,574
Now p
ay..come on.

274
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:48,634
Bravo.

275
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,446
‘And since then I let
my bat do the talking.‘

276
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:59,179
‘Grandpa's dreams were to
see my name become an e><amp
e.'

277
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:02,322
‘Since that day, this game
became a part of me.‘

278
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:05,589
‘I decided..this
is what I had to do.‘

279
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,625
‘One day I must play for India.‘

280
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,158
‘Play for grandpa.‘

281
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,125
‘But I took too long to grow up.

282
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:16,130
What are you doing here?

283
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:20,268
You must go to Ivlumbai.

284
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,273
The selectors are coming,
remember.

285
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:25,346
I can't leave you.

286
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:26,709
Your health.

287
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:28,611
Leave me..

288
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:33,423
Are you a doctor or a nurse?

289
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:35,692
Do what you can.

290
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:38,391
Don't rack your brains.

291
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:42,132
Leave now..or do I need
to give you a whack. - Dad.

292
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,196
I won't be able to play.

293
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:47,637
Fine don't play.

294
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,464
Someone else
will play in your place.

295
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:53,310
Someone e
se's grandpa will be happy.

296
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:56,778
..that he played 100 test-matches.

297
00:18:58,504 --> 00:18:59,209
No..

298
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:02,649
Opportunities
don't wait for anyone.

299
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:06,623
One needs to seize
it at the right time.

300
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:10,390
So what, if you don't go.

301
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:12,587
No!

302
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:18,367
Then do one thing,
tear up your ticket..and go inside.

303
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,631
And go get my medicines.

304
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:25,666
Who cares if someone
else gets selected in the team!

305
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:28,100
Grandpa.

306
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:49,398
Take it.

307
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:11,621
I may not be with you,
but I'll be close to you.

308
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:17,522
I'm going to bat for two days.

309
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:23,531
What's wrong?
Why did everyone shut up?

310
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,043
Ravi, is everything okay?

311
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:56,257
I'm sorry Azhar.

312
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:18,482
Ajju, if you want to go home,
go home.

313
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,559
No Ravi..no.

314
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:26,729
If I don't play today.

315
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,459
..
'

 never
be able to play again.

316
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,071
I want to play 100 test-matches.

317
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:43,575
Grandpa said..if I don't
play 100 test-matches.

318
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,615
..he will whack me with my bat.

319
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:47,807
He will.

320
00:21:50,376 --> 00:21:52,617
I won't play anything
less than 100 test-matches.

321
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:54,516
I won't.

322
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:57,091
Today I will play for my grandpa.

323
00:22:18,471 --> 00:22:19,609
What's wrong, Azhar?

324
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,117
Can't connect
your bat with the ball?

325
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,412
Hovv about I let
the kids teach you?

326
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,383
How's that!

327
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,493
I had heard a lot about him.

328
00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:34,392
But.

329
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:37,400
Guess we'll have to select
someone else from the south-zone.

330
00:22:38,057 --> 00:22:40,094
Bowl a little more to the off-side.

331
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,802
Well I think you guys don't knovv..

332
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:48,105
..that his
grandfather passed away.

333
00:22:48,434 --> 00:22:50,038
He meant everything to him.

334
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:52,742
And it's a big thing that
he's still playing out there.

335
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,541
And that is what you ca

..
Dedication.

336
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:59,182
Ajju..is the ball too fast?

337
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:00,415
Hovv about I bowl
under-arm for you?

338
00:23:02,014 --> 00:23:04,358
He was always speech
ess..

339
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:07,387
..and now,
even his bat has lost his tongue.

340
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:13,561
You must let your game
answer for you.

341
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:18,506
If you yell and scream..on
y
a few will listen.‘

342
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:25,012
‘If your bat does the talking,
everyone will have to listen.‘

343
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:28,676
‘This bat will be your voice.‘

344
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:31,278
‘Now p
ay..come on.‘

345
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:36,693
"To win again."

346
00:23:39,318 --> 00:23:42,492
"To win again."

347
00:23:43,222 --> 00:23:44,758
‘My wrists started
flicking automatically.‘

348
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,498
‘Whether it was my talent
or grandpa's blessings.‘

349
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,265
‘But after that India found Azhar.‘

350
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:51,463
‘And Azhar. .found India.‘

351
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:55,239
A young player from Hyderabad,
debuting against England.

352
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:59,513
He is hitting the ball
all across the ground.

353
00:23:59,572 --> 00:24:02,451
Azhar completes his century
in his first test match.

354
00:24:02,575 --> 00:24:06,182
"To win again."

355
00:24:06,512 --> 00:24:08,287
India is in a difficult
position again.

356
00:24:08,347 --> 00:24:10,623
..and here comes in-form batsman Azhar
on the field.

357
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:14,553
And he hits a four again.

358
00:24:14,587 --> 00:24:18,000
And Azhar has done it again.
Back to back centuries.

359
00:24:18,357 --> 00:24:20,564
Everyone's expectations
are from Azhar.

360
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:25,766
And another flick shot. With
every ball he is breaking boundaries.

361
00:24:26,732 --> 00:24:29,611
This young player from
Hyderabad has created history.

362
00:24:29,735 --> 00:24:31,772
..with a hattrick of centuries.

363
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:37,010
‘That was my past..and
this is my present.‘

364
00:24:37,343 --> 00:24:39,118
Yesterday they pointed fingers..

365
00:24:39,178 --> 00:24:40,521
..today they hurled stones.

366
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:43,691
Tomorrow someone will shoot me.

367
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,596
I am not afraid to die.

368
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:52,296
I am scared of grandpa.

369
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:55,500
..he won't let me in heaven.

370
00:24:56,629 --> 00:25:01,374
Even God couldn't
prove the truth easily.

371
00:25:02,468 --> 00:25:04,072
You are still human.

372
00:25:05,137 --> 00:25:08,141
Don't worry,
we'll think of something.

373
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:10,186
Yes.

374
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:12,486
What?

375
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:14,490
Sure?

376
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,460
Ganesha! Ganesha!
- What happened?

377
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:19,484
More bad luck for you.

378
00:25:19,485 --> 00:25:21,487
Do you know who's defending
the case against you?

379
00:25:21,754 --> 00:25:22,528
Who?

380
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,689
Ivleera!

381
00:25:23,756 --> 00:25:26,259
She was my junior
in London University.

382
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,664
One Ivleera would sing
religious discourses.

383
00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:30,263
..but this one's a real tormentor.

384
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,440
She's a very cunning
and stubborn lawyer.

385
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:35,635
Once she was arguing with
the defendant in a high voice.

386
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:37,078
The judge said order-order.

387
00:25:37,136 --> 00:25:38,410
Do you know what
she said to the judge?

388
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,574
Shut up!

389
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:46,647
What happened?
- First let me say what I was saying..

390
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:48,452
..and then you can speak.

391
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:52,285
You know the Azhar case,
I am fighting it.

392
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:54,029
Wow, that's great.

393
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:56,498
But. - But what?

394
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:59,326
I fought with so many people!

395
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:02,028
I defended him saying
Azhar cannot do such a thing.

396
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,366
I was his biggest fan.

397
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:08,644
He really broke my heart.

398
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:15,008
He is guilty,
and now I've to prove that in court.

399
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:19,017
Did you finish preparing
for the case? - Yup.

400
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:22,519
I am going to India tomorrow.

401
00:26:22,648 --> 00:26:24,559
To meet Azhar's wife, Naureen.

402
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,662
She's a woman wronged.

403
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:31,626
Who else can be a
better witness than her.

404
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:40,773
Does he play cricket as well?

405
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,445
That's not why you're here.

406
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:46,739
No!

407
00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:54,117
Naureen, I want you to
be my witness in this case.

408
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:58,455
Would you like tea..or coffee?

409
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:01,656
Just your support.

410
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:05,525
I've to fetch my son
from the coaching class.

411
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:07,402
Asad must be waiting for me.

412
00:27:07,526 --> 00:27:08,436
I am getting late.

413
00:27:08,594 --> 00:27:13,976
Naureen, the Cricket Association
was shocked, they spoke out.

414
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:17,075
The cricketing fans were outraged,
they refused to stay quiet.

415
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:19,577
You're his wife.. I mean, you were.

416
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:23,143
Didn't you feel bad?

417
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:27,750
Would you like tea..or coffee?

418
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:31,490
You didn't answer my question.
- Neither did you.

419
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:33,630
Tea or coffee?

420
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:37,667
So you won't help me out.

421
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:43,596
Anyway, at least I had
the pleasure of meeting you.

422
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:48,507
Thank you Naureen.
Sorry to have troubled you.

423
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:51,304
Ivleera. - Yes.

424
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:55,107
Do you have children?

425
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:57,315
No, lam still unmarried.

426
00:27:58,077 --> 00:27:59,112
Then you won't understand.

427
00:28:00,446 --> 00:28:03,222
Relationships don't
end even if people seperate.

428
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:07,960
Thank you.

429
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:16,728
What did you say? - Marriage.

430
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:22,639
Mom, I got hit by a ba

..
I can't hear you properly.

431
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,339
I said..your marriage.

432
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:29,344
You must get married. - Do what?

433
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,683
Fine..don't talk to me.

434
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:38,628
Mom. - I don't want to talk to you.

435
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:39,753
Mom..

436
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:43,222
lvlom..listen to me.

437
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:46,632
I was only joking.

438
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,636
Sit down. Come on.

439
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:52,039
What is it?

440
00:28:52,631 --> 00:28:54,338
She's a nice girl, Ajju.

441
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:56,776
I'll be spending the
rest of my life in a helmet.

442
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:58,139
..and she, under a burkha.

443
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,376
Don't get us into this mess.

444
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:01,543
Fine, then you go say no to her.

445
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:13,553
I am..delighted to be here.

446
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:18,525
I am..delighted to be here.

447
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:21,229
Perfect conditions!

448
00:29:22,628 --> 00:29:25,074
We..wi

 give our best.

449
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:29,101
Brother..this isn't a match,
it's a match-making.

450
00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:31,508
This won't do? - Not at all.

451
00:29:33,572 --> 00:29:34,642
Then what should I do?

452
00:29:35,307 --> 00:29:39,619
Say something nice..praise
her all you can.

453
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:43,683
"What beautiful hair you
havemvonderful earrings."

454
00:29:45,184 --> 00:29:48,358
That's nice.. Nice.

455
00:29:48,754 --> 00:29:50,392
"What beautiful hair."

456
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:56,498
"What beautiful
hair..wonderful earrings."

457
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:59,037
"What beautiful
hair..wonderful earrings."

458
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:01,166
And what's this.

459
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,610
Huh..what is this?

460
00:30:04,236 --> 00:30:05,442
Don't blink your eyes.

461
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:10,145
Your eyes may get tired,
but don't look down.

462
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,180
Understand.

463
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:14,382
Look into her eye while speaking.
Like this.

464
00:30:14,513 --> 00:30:15,389
Please come along.

465
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:20,055
Azhar, in this situation,
I can give you my good wishes.

466
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:22,759
But you must pray yourself.

467
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:25,696
Just don't blink.

468
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:29,494
Yes..right.

469
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:39,641
Hey..go inside.

470
00:30:56,288 --> 00:30:58,165
ls there something in your eye?

471
00:30:58,323 --> 00:30:59,768
No, no, no..

472
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:11,704
What beautiful hair you have.

473
00:31:14,106 --> 00:31:15,176
“wonderful earrings.

474
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:22,087
No..
 mean, if you're wearing one..

475
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:23,759
What beautiful hair..

476
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,725
I am delighted to be here.

477
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:38,606
Perfect conditions.
We'll give our best.

478
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:52,182
I thought my daughter's the shy one.

479
00:31:52,544 --> 00:31:54,785
But, it's the same
with your son too.

480
00:31:57,049 --> 00:32:00,155
They will start talking
after they meet a few times.

481
00:32:01,053 --> 00:32:02,361
This is Azhar.

482
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:08,534
Kids!

483
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:11,171
What?

484
00:32:11,563 --> 00:32:13,406
They are seeing you
for the first time.

485
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:15,734
In person, and not on the TV.

486
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:21,745
Come on children, go out.

487
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:23,279
Leave them alone.

488
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:30,621
I didn't do it intentionally.

489
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,471
You can..keep it.

490
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:13,031
Do you accept?

491
00:33:13,058 --> 00:33:14,059
<i>
</i> do!

492
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:15,102
Do you accept?

493
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,002
<i>
</i> do!

494
00:33:16,061 --> 00:33:17,665
Congratulation. Congratulation.

495
00:33:18,063 --> 00:33:19,565
Congratulation. Congratulation.

496
00:33:31,076 --> 00:33:33,784
"
 walked up at your
threshold and stopped."

497
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:37,026
"My eyes have turned believer."

498
00:33:37,149 --> 00:33:38,594
"Together we.."

499
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:42,220
Ajju, can't you hear my voice?

500
00:33:43,088 --> 00:33:44,465
Yes, father. Coming.

501
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:49,095
"Me and you.."

502
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:52,307
"We've bonded together in 
ove."

503
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:55,341
"And become a single soul."

504
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:58,344
"We were incomplete till now."

505
00:33:58,637 --> 00:34:01,049
"But we complete each other now."

506
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:06,454
"Me and you.."

507
00:34:06,645 --> 00:34:12,152
"
'

 say this clearly to you."

508
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:15,254
"It's really simple."

509
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,460
"
 am in love with you."

510
00:34:19,124 --> 00:34:24,540
"That's the reason
I am crazy about you."

511
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:27,610
"It's really simple."

512
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:31,079
"
 am in love with you."

513
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:37,012
"
'

 say this clearly to you."

514
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:40,022
"It's really simple."

515
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:43,218
"
 am in love with you."

516
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:52,628
"
 am in 
ove..with you."

517
00:35:09,174 --> 00:35:11,711
"Just you..and me.."

518
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:15,258
"There's nothing else
I want to wish for."

519
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:18,226
"Should I give my heartor my 
ife.."

520
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:21,454
"Tell me what should I do?"

521
00:35:21,553 --> 00:35:27,629
"Our bond..is more
delicate than the air we breathe."

522
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:33,370
"There's no one like
us..nor there will be."

523
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:36,742
"Like two hearts beating
in a single body.."

524
00:35:37,035 --> 00:35:39,140
"Like you and me.."

525
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:42,615
"Our lives are entwined together."

526
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,382
"Like you and me.."

527
00:35:46,178 --> 00:35:52,356
"
 loved you..more than myself,

"

532
00:36:10,068 --> 00:36:15,313
"That's the reason
I am crazy about you."

533
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:18,454
"It's really simple."

534
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:20,648
"

535
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,490

00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:41,301
"
 am in love with you."

541
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:48,743
Come here.

542
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,050
Don't forget to pack
extra underwear, Ajju.

543
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:53,355
Okay, father.

544
00:37:00,352 --> 00:37:02,491
And count them every night.

545
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:04,628
9K8)’-

546
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:08,634
I'm sure they tear
a lot while playing.

547
00:37:10,495 --> 00:37:11,565
Yes, father.

548
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:17,709
Or someone else will
be playing wearing your underwear.

549
00:37:19,004 --> 00:37:20,347
Yes, father.

550
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:25,215
Ajju.

551
00:37:26,111 --> 00:37:26,987
Yes, father.

552
00:37:27,379 --> 00:37:30,189
Write your name on them as well.

553
00:37:33,018 --> 00:37:33,689
Yes, I'll do that.

554
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:36,522
Son, wear that yellow shirt.

555
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:38,463
You look really handsome in it.

556
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:40,159
Don't forget to pack anything.

557
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:42,637
I've packed everything,
from socks to shirts.

558
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:45,265
But don't forget to recheck.

559
00:37:45,664 --> 00:37:46,665
And underwear?

560
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,635
Alju!

561
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:51,378
Alju!

562
00:37:52,404 --> 00:37:54,179
Why aren't you answering?

563
00:37:54,706 --> 00:37:57,084
l'll wear them over my pant,
like Superman.

564
00:37:57,309 --> 00:37:58,379
You can watch it on TV.

565
00:38:11,056 --> 00:38:11,693
Hello.

566
00:38:14,726 --> 00:38:15,534
Hello.

567
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,240
Who was it?

568
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:32,977
It was her..because I can
even recognize her silence.

569
00:38:35,714 --> 00:38:39,252
I gave you a list of witnesses.

570
00:38:41,553 --> 00:38:42,691
Yes. I saw it.

571
00:38:44,389 --> 00:38:47,097
I struck out two names. - Which ones?

572
00:38:48,393 --> 00:38:49,565
Both my wives.

573
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,104
I don't want them to
face trial because of me.

574
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,572
And I can't say whether the
rest of them will turn-up or not.

575
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:57,504
Don't know?

576
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:03,152
Great. Reddy.

577
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:05,211
What a case!

578
00:39:06,044 --> 00:39:07,318
You won't call your family.

579
00:39:07,612 --> 00:39:08,955
You can't count on your friends.

580
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,291
Let's do one thing.

581
00:39:10,582 --> 00:39:11,993
Why don't we take a deck of cards.

582
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:13,427
..and we'll play rummy in the court.

583
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:18,227
Brother..you spent half
your life amongst these people.

584
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:20,527
There must be someone
who can stand with you?

585
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:26,632
There's one man.
who can do something.

586
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:28,041
Who?

587
00:39:31,336 --> 00:39:32,610
We're on time.

588
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:36,117
If he supports you in the court,
then we may have a chance.

589
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:37,609
Don't worry, Reddy.

590
00:39:38,343 --> 00:39:41,290
He helps people when
Every else is against them.

591
00:39:42,647 --> 00:39:43,352
Come on.

592
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:53,599
President sir's called me..a
one.

593
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:57,106
You worry too much.

594
00:39:57,729 --> 00:40:00,107
- Everything will be fine.
- What fine?

595
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,139
We just lost a match with Pakistan.

596
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,110
And that new boy Sachin,
everyone is cheering for him.

597
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,009
He's in middle-order as well.

598
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:11,447
There's no one who can play like you.

599
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:14,318
What if they fire me?

600
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,686
Hovv can they just fire you?

601
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:18,591
Forget that..hovv much money
do we have in the bank?

602
00:40:19,184 --> 00:40:20,492
We've to pay for our
children's education as well.

603
00:40:20,552 --> 00:40:21,656
Around 5000-6000 rupees.

604
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:23,323
5000-6000 rupees. .that's it.

605
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:28,595
Why do all problems come together?

606
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:31,797
We'll handle it.
Don't vvorry.

607
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:33,809
Just play well.

608
00:40:34,466 --> 00:40:39,347
Keep your head up.
Don't look down.

609
00:40:40,238 --> 00:40:42,218
Fine. I am hanging up.

610
00:40:42,674 --> 00:40:43,778
We'll talk later.

611
00:40:56,421 --> 00:40:57,161
Sir..

612
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:01,326
Would you like to be the captain?

613
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:05,740
But sir..

614
00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:09,078
Anyone else would've jumped with joy.

615
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,405
Sir..the senior
players will get angry.

616
00:41:13,438 --> 00:41:15,748
Hovv can I become the
captain instead of them?

617
00:41:16,007 --> 00:41:20,251
Senior players.
have few more years left.

618
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,352
And after that?

619
00:41:23,748 --> 00:41:25,489
I am looking at the future team.

620
00:41:28,086 --> 00:41:30,692
Speak up..wou
d you
like to be the captain?

621
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:35,399
Yes, I would.

622
00:41:37,362 --> 00:41:39,137
You speak so lovv.

623
00:41:40,198 --> 00:41:42,405
Hovv will the senior
players listen to you?

624
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,416
What if Ravi
is bowling badly.

625
00:41:47,472 --> 00:41:49,281
..or Navjot is misfielding.

626
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:51,521
Ivlanoj makes a mistake. Then?

627
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:55,090
Hovv will you handle it?

628
00:41:58,316 --> 00:41:59,795
Ivlanoj is standing at long-off.

629
00:42:00,385 --> 00:42:01,455
Call him.

630
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,262
Mano]!

631
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:15,372
I couldn't hear it, hovv will he?

632
00:42:25,643 --> 00:42:27,316
Whenever there's
a match played in India.

633
00:42:27,412 --> 00:42:28,652
..the commotion is louder than this.

634
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:32,687
Now call him.

635
00:42:38,356 --> 00:42:39,130
Mano]!

636
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:42,467
Why did you have to play
that out-of-the-line ball?

637
00:42:43,161 --> 00:42:44,299
You got out on the first ball!

638
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:46,436
The entire team was under pressure.

639
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:52,576
The runs aren't too much.

640
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:55,183
But if we keep the
bowling and fielding tight.

641
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,348
..then, we can win this match.

642
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:03,089
What's wrong?
Why is everyone slumping?

643
00:43:03,448 --> 00:43:05,394
Show some energy boys,
we need to win the match.

644
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:09,330
Oh man..you were just recently
appointed captain.

645
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:14,260
Stop lecturing us.

646
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,460
He's right.

647
00:43:17,729 --> 00:43:19,436
I am more experienced than you.

648
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:22,737
Along with the captaincy,
you also found your tongue.

649
00:43:23,401 --> 00:43:24,778
I thought you will be happy.

650
00:43:25,236 --> 00:43:26,544
Your friend became the captain.

651
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,606
I was happy for you my friend..

652
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:31,243
..but not for this
boss that you've become.

653
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:33,148
I'm only doing my duty.

654
00:43:33,177 --> 00:43:35,350
You're taking undue advantage everyone
in the name of duty.

655
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:39,121
"Your fielding's bad..your position
isn't right..you don't make runs."

656
00:43:39,183 --> 00:43:40,594
Great..captain.

657
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,222
If you feel so offended
by my advice.

658
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:43,163
..then quit the team.

659
00:43:43,221 --> 00:43:44,291
What are you saying?

660
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:45,698
Forget it.

661
00:43:45,757 --> 00:43:47,031
What's going, guys?

662
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:48,263
Kapil sir..

663
00:43:51,029 --> 00:43:53,475
Don't get so hot-headed.

664
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:55,574
Show your energy
when we're on the field.

665
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:56,771
Come on.

666
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:59,708
Come on. Come on.

667
00:44:07,245 --> 00:44:09,521
These things will keep happening.

668
00:44:10,181 --> 00:44:12,354
But remember,
one can become captain.

669
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:14,123
..because of his
performance and capability.

670
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:15,730
And you're the captain of India.

671
00:44:16,087 --> 00:44:18,328
Don't feel bad about
such trivial things.

672
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:19,766
Concentrate on your captaincy.

673
00:44:20,024 --> 00:44:23,164
Remember/the naughtiest
boys in the class.

674
00:44:23,194 --> 00:44:25,333
..are the ones who trouble
the monitor the most.

675
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:27,771
Hovv can I be the captain
when my team's against me?

676
00:44:28,066 --> 00:44:31,240
You're not just the
captain of these 11 players.

677
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:33,680
You're the captain
of1 billion Indians.

678
00:44:33,738 --> 00:44:34,739
Understand that.

679
00:44:35,072 --> 00:44:37,177
And once you're on the ground,
you must decide..

680
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:41,053
..whether to win this match and let
those 1 million Indians sleep in peace.

681
00:44:41,112 --> 00:44:43,524
..or lose the match,
and make them weep in their pillows.

682
00:44:44,749 --> 00:44:46,660
Come on, let's go defeat Pakistan.

683
00:44:49,554 --> 00:44:50,362
One thing..

684
00:44:50,588 --> 00:44:54,229
If you ever feel you're alone in life,
let me know.

685
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:57,466
I will stand besides you.

686
00:44:58,596 --> 00:44:59,336
Okay?

687
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:01,465
Come on, freshen up your mood.

688
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,512
Or I'll abuse you in Punjabi now.

689
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:07,110
‘Three types
of vvar are world famous.‘

690
00:45:07,605 --> 00:45:09,516
‘The one between
the husband and wife.‘

691
00:45:09,674 --> 00:45:11,551
‘Between vvater and petrol.‘

692
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:15,081
‘And the India and
Pakistan cricket match.‘

693
00:45:15,146 --> 00:45:16,648
Hello, welcome once again.

694
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:19,354
This match is being played
between India and Pakistan.

695
00:45:19,417 --> 00:45:22,296
..this is a crucial match for the
Indian team's young captain Azhar.

696
00:45:22,353 --> 00:45:24,060
And like every India-Pakistan match.

697
00:45:24,122 --> 00:45:25,032
Mano]!

698
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:28,127
..everyone has high
expectations with this match.

699
00:45:33,631 --> 00:45:35,110
If we lose to Pakistan.

700
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,173
..the people won't let
us out of the stadium.

701
00:45:38,536 --> 00:45:40,277
..and our family won't
let us in the house.

702
00:45:41,172 --> 00:45:42,150
I am trying my best.

703
00:45:43,341 --> 00:45:45,184
They've already smashed
two of your overs.

704
00:45:45,543 --> 00:45:46,681
Now look at this pitch.

705
00:45:47,445 --> 00:45:48,788
You own it.

706
00:45:49,714 --> 00:45:51,716
Bowl at a good length.

707
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,092
Come on.

708
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:57,297
Javed has scored a lot of runs
in Ivlanofs last few overs.

709
00:45:57,455 --> 00:46:01,301
But India's new captain Azhar
has complete faith in his bowler.

710
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:05,665
Boy..no matter who bowls today.

711
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:07,641
..
 am going to smash
them all over the ground.

712
00:46:08,499 --> 00:46:09,671
What's wrong, Javed?

713
00:46:10,535 --> 00:46:12,208
Did you take an
extra-dose of ovaltine?

714
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:15,211
It's Friday? - So?

715
00:46:15,673 --> 00:46:17,175
Allah's with us!

716
00:46:19,444 --> 00:46:21,185
You're forgetting, brother.

717
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:22,680
Mohammed's in my name.

718
00:46:30,221 --> 00:46:32,497
He's making his delivery.

719
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:34,025
Come on.

720
00:46:36,494 --> 00:46:40,237
And that's excellent drive from Javed on
the backfoot, and hits that for a four

721
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:43,575
And the Pakistani supporters
are ce
ebrating..

722
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:46,342
Javecfs looking at Azhar.

723
00:46:47,071 --> 00:46:49,608
They had a bit of
a tiff before this ball.

724
00:46:49,674 --> 00:46:52,655
And Javecfs given a fitting reply.

725
00:46:53,444 --> 00:46:56,721
Cricket lovers are
enjoying great batting.

726
00:46:57,181 --> 00:46:59,593
Ivlanoj on his way for
his second delivery.

727
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:08,093
He tried to drive that.
..And Azhar's caught it..

728
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:11,739
And we can see the happiness
in the Indian cricket team camp.

729
00:47:12,063 --> 00:47:15,601
It's very imported wicket for india.

730
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:25,711
You.

731
00:47:25,743 --> 00:47:26,619
Azhar..

732
00:47:28,479 --> 00:47:30,652
Kapil sir has apologized.

733
00:47:31,082 --> 00:47:32,527
Why? What's wrong?

734
00:47:32,717 --> 00:47:36,426
He said he can't meet today,
because he's busy.

735
00:47:39,457 --> 00:47:40,993
But we've come a really long way.

736
00:47:41,092 --> 00:47:42,298
He knew we were coming.

737
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,771
Hovv can we go back?

738
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:49,000
Sir, I told you what he told me.

739
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,074
Sorry, sir..

740
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:51,438
But.

741
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:52,570
Listen..

742
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,077
Everyone's refusing to help us.

743
00:48:00,011 --> 00:48:02,617
And who knows what
lvleera's got her hands on.

744
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:11,191
I am so happy to be back home.

745
00:48:13,457 --> 00:48:15,403
I really miss London.

746
00:48:16,427 --> 00:48:20,341
But you know,
once you get busy with vvork..

747
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,168
..then you can bid adieu
to your private life.

748
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:23,507
That's true.

749
00:48:24,168 --> 00:48:26,671
But remember hovv
we would bunk classes.

750
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:28,375
..to go watch the match.

751
00:48:28,973 --> 00:48:30,145
Like crazy people.

752
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:34,288
And you chase after Azhar.

753
00:48:36,714 --> 00:48:39,718
I still am..but my
reasons have changed.

754
00:48:42,153 --> 00:48:45,532
And that reason is..
\/IK Sharma. Right?

755
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:47,227
Yeah, that's right, Sanam.

756
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:50,338
You and your newspaper really
did a great job in finding him.

757
00:48:51,095 --> 00:48:53,336
He's really important for this case.

758
00:48:53,497 --> 00:48:56,740
It's not a problem at all,
don't vvorry.

759
00:48:57,201 --> 00:49:01,206
You know, everyone in UK
is just as shocked, as in India.

760
00:49:02,006 --> 00:49:06,148
Here. . MK's address.

761
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:08,680
He's living here under a false name.

762
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,182
May I help you?

763
00:49:13,984 --> 00:49:16,089
What do they call you here?

764
00:49:17,188 --> 00:49:18,667
IVIK Sharma, or..

765
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:21,694
Don't worry, I am not the police.

766
00:49:22,493 --> 00:49:24,473
But I know everything about you.

767
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:32,045
You've complete information about me?
What do you want?

768
00:49:32,403 --> 00:49:33,279
Azhar!

769
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:36,443
Please, sit down.

770
00:49:37,241 --> 00:49:38,982
Nothing's going to happen. Please.

771
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:51,022
The police coerced everything
out of me in the torture room.

772
00:49:51,622 --> 00:49:54,034
Even made me sign the papers.

773
00:49:55,092 --> 00:49:56,366
I don't have any more information.

774
00:49:56,393 --> 00:50:00,466
I am after what the police
couldn't coerce out of you.

775
00:50:01,032 --> 00:50:02,636
I don't have any information.
I don't know anything.

776
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,407
And why should I tell you?

777
00:50:04,535 --> 00:50:07,675
The truth is..

don't want to be dead.

778
00:50:07,738 --> 00:50:09,217
Hovv long can you run?

779
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:12,252
I will try to save you.

780
00:50:12,543 --> 00:50:14,022
Just tell me..

781
00:50:15,312 --> 00:50:18,782
You gave Azhar 1O million
during the Jubilee Cup, didn't you?

782
00:50:26,323 --> 00:50:27,393
Spare me.

783
00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:30,129
I don't want to die
by answering your questions.

784
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,231
Look, this will all be confidential.

785
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:35,409
Your name won't be mentioned anywhere.
That's my guarantee.

786
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:39,407
Come on, hovv long are
you going to hide here?

787
00:50:39,804 --> 00:50:41,545
Azhar's roaming free.

788
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,078
This is your chance to get back.

789
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:47,184
Help me get him arrested.

790
00:50:47,311 --> 00:50:48,153
Come on.

791
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:57,257
I used to make a decent
living from betting.

792
00:50:58,389 --> 00:51:03,065
But..no one gives up an
opportunity to do something big.

793
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:07,200
So..
 took the leap as well.

794
00:51:09,266 --> 00:51:10,267
Hello, Marshall.

795
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:13,446
‘I made a plan and
approached Marshall.‘

796
00:51:13,504 --> 00:51:15,279
I can fi>< the entire series.

797
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:18,148
With Marshall's supportl
set out to fi>< the whole game.

798
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:25,587
I was in search of a 12th man.

799
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,252
One who could get me in the
Indian team's dressing room!

800
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:30,324
And I found him.

801
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:32,261
Hovv much did you lose?

802
00:51:33,691 --> 00:51:35,170
500, OOO!

803
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:43,440
‘I paid his loss,
and in return I got..information.'

804
00:51:44,335 --> 00:51:46,315
‘Every detail about the players.‘

805
00:51:46,637 --> 00:51:48,742
'..their taste, their choice..'

806
00:51:49,273 --> 00:51:51,583
‘Even their family issues.‘

807
00:51:51,742 --> 00:51:52,720
We can get him.

808
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,278
I don't want to waste my money.

809
00:51:54,812 --> 00:51:58,589
‘Millions of sentiments are
connected with these 11 players.‘

810
00:51:59,183 --> 00:52:02,653
‘We had to knovv..who was
willing to sell out his God.‘

811
00:52:03,154 --> 00:52:08,729
Azhar! Azhar! Azhar!

812
00:52:09,093 --> 00:52:10,766
Now he can come in handy.

813
00:52:12,096 --> 00:52:14,076
Get him over,
and we can get rolling.

814
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:17,768
Expensive habits..e><pensive
gir
friends..

815
00:52:18,169 --> 00:52:19,705
Their girlfriends habits.

816
00:52:21,372 --> 00:52:22,407
What happened then?

817
00:52:23,274 --> 00:52:24,344
Did Azhar say yes?

818
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:26,385
Has anyone ever said no to money?

819
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:28,616
I gave him 1O mi

ion..in cash.

820
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:32,322
Testify against him in the court.

821
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:34,321
You'll be safe.

822
00:52:34,418 --> 00:52:36,523
Forget about me,
think about yourself.

823
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:41,726
RemembenAzhar cares for no one.

824
00:52:44,395 --> 00:52:47,706
"
ndian Captain Sourav
is just one match short.."

825
00:52:47,765 --> 00:52:50,041
"..of breaking Azhar's
captaincy record.."

826
00:52:50,234 --> 00:52:51,440
"
n other cricket news.."

827
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:54,142
"India's former captain Azhar.."

828
00:52:54,205 --> 00:52:57,084
"..has decided to challenge
the life-ban imposed on him."

829
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:58,744
"Today is the first hearing
of the case."

830
00:53:05,416 --> 00:53:08,158

\/Ir. Azhar. 
\/Ir. Azhar.

831
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:12,060

\/Ir. Azhar,
would you like to say something.

832
00:53:12,156 --> 00:53:14,227
..about the match-fi><ing
charges against you?

833
00:53:14,258 --> 00:53:15,566
Anything?

834
00:53:16,093 --> 00:53:18,266

\/Ir. Azhar, why aren't your
team members supporting you?

835
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:19,203
Answer me.

836
00:53:19,263 --> 00:53:21,368
Azhar, why did you take the bribes?

837
00:53:21,432 --> 00:53:23,503
ls it something you did..
or maybe some love-affair.

838
00:53:26,103 --> 00:53:28,640
People give-up their
life for love, they don't take bribe.

839
00:53:30,074 --> 00:53:32,748
It's not like what you think.

840
00:53:37,247 --> 00:53:41,093
As you can see..Azhar is
still answering in his unique style.

841
00:53:41,151 --> 00:53:42,721
But we'll get the right answers.

842
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:45,022
..when the verdict
on this case is announced.

843
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:47,368
Hello, Azhar.

844
00:53:47,424 --> 00:53:48,596
Here comes the traitor.

845
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:02,448
All rise.

846
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:15,052
Plaintiff, please present
your appeal to the court.

847
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:19,762
Yes, your honor..

848
00:54:22,226 --> 00:54:26,299
We appeal that the
ban imposed on Azhar..

849
00:54:26,397 --> 00:54:31,073
..by the Cricket
Association is baseless.

850
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:35,515
It's illegal, and should be
dismissed immediately.

851
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:46,719
Defendant, your plea.

852
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:52,157
Your honor,
the ban is imposed on the grounds..

853
00:54:52,356 --> 00:54:54,666
..that Azhar fi><ed three matches.

854
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:56,772
He took money in order to lose.

855
00:54:57,094 --> 00:55:00,974
India Vs South Africa,
Jubilee Cup, 1996. Rajkot.

856
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:03,307
India Vs Sri Lanka, 1998.

857
00:55:03,567 --> 00:55:06,707
And India Vs Pakistan,
Jaipur. 1999.

858
00:55:07,071 --> 00:55:08,482
He's guilty of fi><ing matches.

859
00:55:08,539 --> 00:55:10,610
..and letting down hundreds
of cricketing fans.

860
00:55:10,674 --> 00:55:12,347
..a
ong with the entire nation.

861
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:17,622
Your honor,
the court believes in the truth.

862
00:55:18,182 --> 00:55:21,755
And the truth shall be revealed soon.

863
00:55:22,352 --> 00:55:24,354
Sir..

864
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:28,198
Azhar's made his identity
through his game.

865
00:55:28,258 --> 00:55:30,363
..and he has a right
to defend that name.

866
00:55:30,561 --> 00:55:32,438
Ms. Ivleera, your witness.

867
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:35,477
Your honor, I would like
to call Azhar to the witness bo><.

868
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,278
Proceed.

869
00:55:49,413 --> 00:55:51,359
Please repeat after me and swear.

870
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:53,793
‘I Will tell the truth,
and nothing but the truth.‘

871
00:55:54,051 --> 00:55:57,521
If I am honest,
then my God will save me!

872
00:55:59,256 --> 00:56:02,669
I will tell the truth,
and nothing but the truth.

873
00:56:05,662 --> 00:56:10,133
Your honor, there's no
surprise if people change.

874
00:56:11,135 --> 00:56:14,082
People even change their faith when
their prayers aren't answered.

875
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:18,353
When Azhar realized that
his playing days are numbered.

876
00:56:18,475 --> 00:56:21,388
..he started
taking money for his game.

877
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:22,651
Objection your honor.

878
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:25,392
Ms. Ivleera,
please stick to the case.

879
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:26,456
Yes, your honor.

880
00:56:26,517 --> 00:56:28,394
May l, your honor.
- Proceed.

881
00:56:37,461 --> 00:56:38,496
Thank you.

882
00:56:42,499 --> 00:56:43,705
Your honor, Jubilee Cup.

883
00:56:43,767 --> 00:56:46,077
India Vs South Africa, Rajkot.

884
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:48,514
What is your score?

885
00:56:49,206 --> 00:56:50,583
Just 9 runs.

886
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:54,085
Another match in the Jubilee Cup,
your honor.

887
00:56:54,144 --> 00:56:55,384
India Vs Australia.

888
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:59,250
Azhar's score, just 1 run your honor.

889
00:57:00,984 --> 00:57:03,464
Your score's telling your truth.

890
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,529
Objection, your honor.

891
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:09,527
Ms. Ivleera is altering the
evidence to her convenience.

892
00:57:10,027 --> 00:57:12,234
What is your point, 
\/Ir. Reddy.

893
00:57:12,496 --> 00:57:15,443
Ms. lvleera's concealing
the real facts.

894
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:17,306
What do you mean?

895
00:57:18,969 --> 00:57:20,471
My client didn't have
a different agenda.

896
00:57:20,537 --> 00:57:22,448
..your honor it was
just sheer bad luck.

897
00:57:22,506 --> 00:57:24,042
May I. - Sure.

898
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:31,517
Your honor, in cricket.

899
00:57:31,582 --> 00:57:33,687
..the batsmen often get out
due to wrong decisions.

900
00:57:33,751 --> 00:57:35,560
And this was one such decision.

901
00:57:39,022 --> 00:57:41,059
So now you're blaming the umpire..

902
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,364
..in order to save your client.

903
00:57:42,426 --> 00:57:45,270
I am accused of intentionally
throwing away my wicket.

904
00:57:45,529 --> 00:57:47,008
Take look at this footage.

905
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:49,438
Did I play some easy
shot and give my wicket?

906
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:51,571
I was given out
due to wrong decision.

907
00:57:51,735 --> 00:57:53,442
You can all see.

908
00:57:53,604 --> 00:57:55,049
The entire stadium was yelling.

909
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:00,477
"Everyone please calm down,
or the match will have to be stopped."

910
00:58:00,677 --> 00:58:02,020
It was a clear inside edge.

911
00:58:05,115 --> 00:58:08,289
Your honor, if Ms.
lvleera's telling the truth..

912
00:58:08,352 --> 00:58:13,665
..and my client took money
to under-perform, then what is this?

913
00:58:15,292 --> 00:58:17,568
India Vs Australia, Jubilee Cup.

914
00:58:18,195 --> 00:58:20,698
If India had lost this match,
they would've been out of the series.

915
00:58:21,031 --> 00:58:24,569
But I am sure Ms.
Ivleera can see Azhar's score clearly.

916
00:58:24,634 --> 00:58:26,545
94 runs.. Man of the Match.

917
00:58:26,603 --> 00:58:28,480
That's his game-plan.

918
00:58:28,639 --> 00:58:30,118
Under-perform for some matches.

919
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:31,550
..and do better in others.

920
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:33,051
So that he makes money..

921
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:34,589
..as well as secure
his place in the team.

922
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:36,555
He's a true all-rounder.

923
00:58:36,613 --> 00:58:38,684
Clearly you're a better
all-rounder than I am.

924
00:58:39,116 --> 00:58:41,096
You're the judge and jury.

925
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:45,595

\/Ir. Azhar, hovv long have
you known IVIK Sharma aka Shawn?

926
00:58:45,722 --> 00:58:47,224
I don't know him. - That's a lie.

927
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,604
We've these CBI reports,
your honor.

928
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:55,041
And according to these reports.

929
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:57,442
..you have met 
\/Ir.
IVIK Sharma before.

930
00:58:57,668 --> 00:59:01,616
I've even met you, Ms. Ivleera.
But I didn't know you.

931
00:59:02,072 --> 00:59:04,643
Please tell the court where
you met him for the first time.

932
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:12,050
'95 or '96.. with Jay.

933
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:14,393
Royal Hotel, London.

934
00:59:15,018 --> 00:59:16,019
I don't remember the day.

935
00:59:16,086 --> 00:59:18,259
But I do know it was morning.

936
00:59:18,322 --> 00:59:20,427
And there was a lot
happening in my life.

937
00:59:20,657 --> 00:59:22,603
That's when I met
IVIK for the first time.

938
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:24,138
Greetings.

939
00:59:25,495 --> 00:59:26,303
Greetings.

940
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:27,973
What brings you here?

941
00:59:27,998 --> 00:59:32,003
Well, this is Shawn,
and he's a big diamond trader.

942
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:33,173
And a good friend.

943
00:59:33,337 --> 00:59:35,044
Hello. - Hello.

944
00:59:35,172 --> 00:59:38,449
He has a proposal for you.

945
00:59:38,642 --> 00:59:41,088
Since he was in London,
and so were you..

946
00:59:41,144 --> 00:59:43,454
..
 thought I
would introduce you two.

947
00:59:44,514 --> 00:59:46,585
I am big fan of yours.

948
00:59:49,152 --> 00:59:51,632
If this is about an ad,
then I can't do it now.

949
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:54,235
The Jubilee Cup is coming up.

950
00:59:54,291 --> 00:59:56,032
So it's difficult
to spare any time.

951
00:59:57,027 --> 00:59:58,404
Fine..it's alright.

952
00:59:58,762 --> 01:00:04,576
But since we're already here,
if you could spare five minutes.

953
01:00:05,535 --> 01:00:07,640
You can see hovv
busy I am right now.

954
01:00:08,004 --> 01:00:09,415
You're right.

955
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:12,679
We'll meet some other day
and talk when you're comfortable.

956
01:00:12,743 --> 01:00:13,687
See you.

957
01:00:14,344 --> 01:00:17,120
Your name? - Shawn.

958
01:00:17,347 --> 01:00:18,690
Shawn. - Shawn.

959
01:00:19,249 --> 01:00:20,193
Shawn.

960
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:23,627
Please tell the court everything
that happened in that meeting.

961
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:26,631
They praised me..and my batting.

962
01:00:26,757 --> 01:00:31,137
A bookie..meets with
a team captain.

963
01:00:31,194 --> 01:00:32,798
..and he just
shook hands with you and left?

964
01:00:33,063 --> 01:00:34,770
I didn't know he was a bookie.

965
01:00:35,499 --> 01:00:37,479
He said he was a fan.

966
01:00:37,601 --> 01:00:38,773
The truth is, 
\/Ir. Azhar that.

967
01:00:39,036 --> 01:00:42,711
..you took 1O million rupees
from IVIK Sharma to underplay.

968
01:00:43,073 --> 01:00:47,488
We have Hansie's statement,
which he gave to his Association.

969
01:00:49,346 --> 01:00:53,158
Your honor, truth can
be suppressed but not hidden.

970
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,420
And the truth is..

971
01:00:54,484 --> 01:01:00,594
..Azhar has betrayed his team. His
country, his fans and his community

972
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:03,164
Ms. Ivleera, the real traitors
are not easy to apprehend.

973
01:01:03,226 --> 01:01:04,637
Whereas I've come
to your court myself.

974
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:07,134
Your honor, this is a personal attack.
- Yes, it's personal.

975
01:01:07,197 --> 01:01:09,108
I might be the one talking, but It's
the voice of those 1 billion people.

976
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:10,236
And Azhar came here..

977
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:12,109
..so he can tell the truth
to those 1 billion people.

978
01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:15,150
Ivleeramoney is not
above honor and love.

979
01:01:15,205 --> 01:01:17,116
Order. Order.

980
01:01:17,407 --> 01:01:20,251
This is a lawsuit,
not some street fight.

981
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:21,452
Yes, your honor.

982
01:01:21,645 --> 01:01:24,182
Both of you be careful
and show some civility.

983
01:01:24,748 --> 01:01:25,556
Yes, your honor.

984
01:01:25,649 --> 01:01:27,219
Court is adjourned
till the ne><t date.

985
01:01:29,386 --> 01:01:32,424
During the first hearing on Azhar's
case, it's been proven that.

986
01:01:32,489 --> 01:01:34,230
..he did meet IVIK Sharma.

987
01:01:34,291 --> 01:01:36,601
But did he take money from IVIK Sharma?

988
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:41,498
‘Everyone wants to know
whether I met IVIK Sharma or not.‘

989
01:01:47,404 --> 01:01:51,648
Sometimes money is more
useful than people.

990
01:01:52,376 --> 01:01:53,514
Think about it.

991
01:01:54,311 --> 01:01:56,757
The Association
does as it pleases.

992
01:01:58,048 --> 01:01:59,493
Your bat does the talking.

993
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,320
..but they give the orders.

994
01:02:01,485 --> 01:02:04,762
Because they can fire anyone
they like, or make anyone captain.

995
01:02:04,988 --> 01:02:06,592
Everyone's looking
out for themselves.

996
01:02:07,023 --> 01:02:08,161
You should too.

997
01:02:09,259 --> 01:02:12,172
When you step out
of this dressing room..

998
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:14,235
..there will be nothing left.

999
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,233
That's when you will regret.

1000
01:02:16,633 --> 01:02:17,771
What will you do then?

1001
01:02:18,368 --> 01:02:19,711
Hovv will you make ends meet?

1002
01:02:21,338 --> 01:02:22,339
So what should I do?

1003
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:25,076
Sell out my country
for a little money.

1004
01:02:25,642 --> 01:02:27,019
Little money?

1005
01:02:31,281 --> 01:02:32,760
1O million!

1006
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:35,630
There's 1O million in this bag.

1007
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:37,754
You won't make this
kind of money in 1O years.

1008
01:02:40,624 --> 01:02:43,127
What if we're caught?
- Hovv can they catch you?

1009
01:02:43,293 --> 01:02:46,433
What can they do if you get
out in a match ear
y..

1010
01:02:46,663 --> 01:02:48,199
..ca

 the police?

1011
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:52,770
There's also a phone in this bag,
untraceable.

1012
01:02:53,136 --> 01:02:55,412
If you ever want to talk to me,
give me a miss call.

1013
01:02:55,539 --> 01:02:56,449
I'll know.

1014
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:59,177
And..
 know you are smart.

1015
01:03:04,014 --> 01:03:05,516
Aren't you scared?

1016
01:03:07,751 --> 01:03:10,288
If I yell out loud,
a huge crowd will gather around.

1017
01:03:11,087 --> 01:03:16,127
And they will beat you to a pulp.

1018
01:03:19,062 --> 01:03:22,043
That's why there's
more money in the bag.

1019
01:03:23,733 --> 01:03:28,273
When money
talks..everyone listens.

1020
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:30,743
Think about it.

1021
01:03:31,675 --> 01:03:35,384
If you don't take this
opportunity, someone else will.

1022
01:03:38,548 --> 01:03:39,526
1O million.

1023
01:03:41,117 --> 01:03:43,188
There's 1O million in this bag.

1024
01:03:44,721 --> 01:03:47,361
And you need to do just one job.

1025
01:03:48,091 --> 01:03:49,229
‘Do-nothing!‘

1026
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:05,275
You are right.

1027
01:04:06,976 --> 01:04:08,319
Everyone wants
money after all.‘

1028
01:04:46,783 --> 01:04:48,387
Ivlahendra finishes off in style.

1029
01:04:48,451 --> 01:04:50,522
India wins the 2011 World Cup.

1030
01:04:50,587 --> 01:04:53,796
And it's a Indian captain who
has been absolutely magnificient.

1031
01:04:54,357 --> 01:04:57,065
‘Another captain..another
World Cup.‘

1032
01:04:57,494 --> 01:05:01,442
‘It's been 8 years..but there's
been no progress in my case.‘

1033
01:05:06,369 --> 01:05:08,508
Since you got what you
vvanted..you decided to keep quiet.

1034
01:05:12,075 --> 01:05:13,577
You see Ms.
Ivleera, I can't e><act
y..

1035
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:16,589
..pry open my chest
like Hanuman and prove..

1036
01:05:16,646 --> 01:05:18,592
..
've nothing to hide.

1037
01:05:19,149 --> 01:05:20,457
Everything's right before you.

1038
01:05:20,517 --> 01:05:21,655
I already said what I had to.

1039
01:05:21,718 --> 01:05:23,220
There's nothing more
I want to say now.

1040
01:05:23,486 --> 01:05:24,658
There's still one match
no one's spoken about.

1041
01:05:25,088 --> 01:05:28,001
31 st October, 1996
India Vs West Indies,

1042
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:32,006
What happened in that match?

1043
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:36,232
Did you try getting
a job with the Crime Branch?

1044
01:05:36,399 --> 01:05:38,140
No..you would've gotten the job.

1045
01:05:38,368 --> 01:05:42,111
What made you become a lawyer?

1046
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:48,017
Tell me..what do you
know about that match?

1047
01:05:48,044 --> 01:05:49,717
The vvhole world knows
about that match.

1048
01:05:51,648 --> 01:05:54,151
We had few balls,
and needed more runs.

1049
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:56,421
It was time to attack,
and not play defense.

1050
01:05:57,087 --> 01:05:59,260
I can understand
tension in a game.

1051
01:05:59,556 --> 01:06:00,557
I held my ground..alone.

1052
01:06:00,724 --> 01:06:03,000
Everyone e
se..came and left.

1053
01:06:03,527 --> 01:06:05,973
Ivlanoj was only playing
to score his century.

1054
01:06:06,129 --> 01:06:08,006
‘Azhar, he's only
playing for himself.‘

1055
01:06:08,198 --> 01:06:08,972
‘Be careful out there.‘

1056
01:06:12,569 --> 01:06:14,640
You know what, Tony.
It hurts.

1057
01:06:16,339 --> 01:06:18,341
Feeling really sad
for Ivlanoj right now.

1058
01:06:20,110 --> 01:06:23,421
Anyone else would've
retired hurt, and back to pavilion.

1059
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:24,991
But he stood his ground.

1060
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:27,321
He sent all his team-mates
back to the pavilion.

1061
01:06:27,417 --> 01:06:28,418
..but stood his ground.

1062
01:06:28,618 --> 01:06:30,495
All he cared about was
raising his bat in the air..

1063
01:06:30,687 --> 01:06:31,688
..after completing his century.

1064
01:06:32,088 --> 01:06:33,590
Even if it meant
shaming the entire team.

1065
01:06:33,757 --> 01:06:35,430
He's playing so selfishly.

1066
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:38,537
I wasn't making the
century for myself.

1067
01:06:39,028 --> 01:06:40,132
I was doing it for the team.

1068
01:06:40,196 --> 01:06:41,698
I admit I was playing s
ow..

1069
01:06:41,764 --> 01:06:43,607
“but, we had already lost the game.

1070
01:06:44,133 --> 01:06:47,137
In fact,
I saved my team's honor that day.

1071
01:06:47,537 --> 01:06:49,380
I thought I'll get
a pat on the back, but.

1072
01:06:49,572 --> 01:06:50,778
‘You made us lose a winning game.‘

1073
01:06:51,174 --> 01:06:52,778
‘Leave my collar.‘

1074
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:56,012
‘I had instructions to play slow.‘

1075
01:06:56,479 --> 01:06:57,753
‘I did as I was told.‘

1076
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:01,125
No sane captain will ever say..

1077
01:07:01,417 --> 01:07:04,023
"Forget the team,
and complete your century first."

1078
01:07:08,725 --> 01:07:12,298
Are you sure..you were given
instructions not to save the match.

1079
01:07:12,362 --> 01:07:13,170
Of course.

1080
01:07:13,330 --> 01:07:16,106
That day I realizectsomething
was definately wrong.

1081
01:07:16,299 --> 01:07:19,041
They were playing a game
other than cricket.

1082
01:07:19,235 --> 01:07:21,146
But everyone came after me.

1083
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:22,575
They blamed me for everything.

1084
01:07:22,639 --> 01:07:24,312
Not only did he play badly.

1085
01:07:24,507 --> 01:07:27,044
..but he blamed the coach and me..

1086
01:07:27,076 --> 01:07:28,578
..c
aiming that we
told him to play slowly.

1087
01:07:33,283 --> 01:07:38,164
Tortoisesnonly win in stories,
not in real life.

1088
01:07:39,088 --> 01:07:40,533
We dropped him
from the ne><t match.

1089
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:44,037
And it's a lovely drive
through covers for a four.

1090
01:07:44,627 --> 01:07:46,538
India placed a huge total.

1091
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:49,073
Let's see if West
indies can chase this.

1092
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:52,770
You know, Ravi, West Indies
have some pretty good hookers.

1093
01:07:56,272 --> 01:07:56,773
Yeah?

1094
01:07:57,373 --> 01:08:01,480
Brian slashes at the ball,
and what an amazing catch by Azhar.

1095
01:08:01,544 --> 01:08:04,252
This man can field in any position.

1096
01:08:04,614 --> 01:08:06,184
India are the champions.

1097
01:08:07,283 --> 01:08:10,230
And the Ivlan of the Match is
none other than the captain Azhar.

1098
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:13,261
Can you tell me little
bit about the strategy?

1099
01:08:13,423 --> 01:08:16,734
We batted vvell,
bowled well and..fielded well.

1100
01:08:18,962 --> 01:08:22,034
He dropped me out of the
team..didn't let me play the match.

1101
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:23,406
But, that wasn't enough for them.

1102
01:08:26,970 --> 01:08:28,381
Quiet!

1103
01:08:29,239 --> 01:08:30,741
I thought of you as my brothers.

1104
01:08:31,007 --> 01:08:32,680
They fired a rocket at me.

1105
01:08:32,742 --> 01:08:37,657
I made up my mind..
to expose this entire racket.

1106
01:08:38,047 --> 01:08:39,253
I see you're doing that already.

1107
01:08:39,482 --> 01:08:41,428
Anyway, thank you Ivlanoj.

1108
01:08:41,618 --> 01:08:43,120
This has been really helpful.

1109
01:08:44,521 --> 01:08:47,127
Don't you think/this
case is taking too 
ong..

1110
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:49,996
..
ike Ramayan or Ivlahabharat?

1111
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:53,505
No..
 mean, hovv much longer?

1112
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:56,167
Soon. I am trying my best.

1113
01:08:56,499 --> 01:08:59,002
Are you going to put up
an exhibition of the evidence?

1114
01:09:00,236 --> 01:09:02,273
I performed the sting
operation 11 years ago.

1115
01:09:02,338 --> 01:09:04,375
..so that everyone who's guilty,
gets punished.

1116
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:05,612
And I get the credit.

1117
01:09:05,708 --> 01:09:07,244
..as the guy who exposed everyone.

1118
01:09:07,377 --> 01:09:08,617
But what happened?

1119
01:09:08,678 --> 01:09:11,124
Neither did they get punished,
nor did I get any credit.

1120
01:09:11,347 --> 01:09:12,621
You will.
- But.

1121
01:09:14,617 --> 01:09:18,258
Even I have a 
ife..
- What do you think?

1122
01:09:18,488 --> 01:09:20,195
Are you the only
one who wasted his life?

1123
01:09:20,256 --> 01:09:22,395
I've spent 8 years
of my life on this case.

1124
01:09:22,458 --> 01:09:23,732
Been married for 3 years.

1125
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:25,370
And have been telling my husband
for the past 2 years.

1126
01:09:25,428 --> 01:09:27,271
..that once the case ends
we'll finally go for our honeymoon.

1127
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:29,003
Look..
- You made the allegations.

1128
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:30,371
But we're the ones who
have to prove them.

1129
01:09:31,434 --> 01:09:34,381
And yes..you must
have a lot of buddies.

1130
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:36,278
But I am not one of them.

1131
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:38,741
A~**

1132
01:09:40,243 --> 01:09:43,690
We now clearly know who the
brain behind all this is.

1133
01:09:45,114 --> 01:09:46,752
But I can't defend this case.

1134
01:09:49,052 --> 01:09:50,463
What's wrong with you suddenly?

1135
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,500
I don't want to waste
ours or the court's time.

1136
01:09:52,555 --> 01:09:56,162
..by defending this hopeless case.

1137
01:09:58,528 --> 01:10:03,375
Our strongest witness
is your biggest weakness.

1138
01:10:03,433 --> 01:10:07,745
I've told you 100 times,
I can't bring Sangeeta to the court.

1139
01:10:08,004 --> 01:10:09,540
Why? Why not?

1140
01:10:10,106 --> 01:10:12,347
She's the reason you're
in this situation.

1141
01:10:12,408 --> 01:10:13,785
You're crossing your limits.

1142
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:16,455
Not me, the pub
ic's saying this.

1143
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:18,116
The country's saying this.

1144
01:10:18,314 --> 01:10:22,387
An innocent Hyderabad boy
sold himself out for a heroine.

1145
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:26,257
Imported cars,
designer c
othes..hi-fi lifestyle.

1146
01:10:26,356 --> 01:10:28,029
I've worked hard for all of it.

1147
01:10:28,191 --> 01:10:30,569
I represent India,
so what's wrong in looking good.

1148
01:10:30,793 --> 01:10:33,137
You used to represent India.

1149
01:10:34,631 --> 01:10:35,575
Used to.

1150
01:10:36,599 --> 01:10:38,601
And the reason
behind that is Sangeeta!

1151
01:10:39,302 --> 01:10:40,781
She set you on this path.

1152
01:10:41,037 --> 01:10:43,449
Sangeeta has nothing
to do with this case.

1153
01:10:43,707 --> 01:10:45,414
She's suffered more than I have.

1154
01:10:54,217 --> 01:10:56,163
Everything was
going good between us.

1155
01:10:58,721 --> 01:11:01,167
But, whether it's cricket or 
ove..

1156
01:11:02,459 --> 01:11:06,407
..if the timings not right,
nothings right.

1157
01:11:10,667 --> 01:11:13,170
What gorgeous girls.

1158
01:11:14,604 --> 01:11:18,211
If you get in this mess it
will ruin your game and concentration.

1159
01:11:19,109 --> 01:11:20,213
Ajju, it's nothing like that.

1160
01:11:20,410 --> 01:11:22,481
Do you know the kind
of willpower it takes.

1161
01:11:22,612 --> 01:11:24,717
..to not look at a beautiful girl?

1162
01:11:26,082 --> 01:11:29,086
Hovv about we..blindfold ourselves?

1163
01:11:29,419 --> 01:11:32,229
Do it. At least then
you might score a century.

1164
01:11:33,089 --> 01:11:35,569
Go ahead, mock me all you want.

1165
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:37,627
Ravi isn't in form right now.

1166
01:11:37,794 --> 01:11:41,332
But Ravi is into some
other kind of form right now.

1167
01:11:41,731 --> 01:11:44,575
Fine..then let's go
for our physio-therapy.

1168
01:11:45,034 --> 01:11:47,139
Where are you going? It's my booking.
- I'll tell you.

1169
01:11:51,074 --> 01:11:55,648
Today's physio-therapy..is
going to be 70mm wide.

1170
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:58,150
A Bollywood heroine's here.

1171
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,300
You'll get a whacking in 3D

1172
01:12:06,456 --> 01:12:08,458
Don't forget,
your wife's here too.

1173
01:12:09,025 --> 01:12:15,635
My innocent friend, according to my
wife I am with you in physio-therapy.

1174
01:12:15,698 --> 01:12:17,200
I won't lie for you.

1175
01:12:17,266 --> 01:12:21,237
You have to do these
things for friends sometimes.

1176
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:33,689
She looks hotter in real life.

1177
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:38,563
You guys can't even tell the
difference between real and fake.

1178
01:12:39,255 --> 01:12:40,256
See that, ne><t to her.

1179
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:41,467
That's real beauty.

1180
01:12:41,591 --> 01:12:43,400
You're absolutely right, Ajju.

1181
01:12:43,459 --> 01:12:44,767
The real beauty is in a sari.

1182
01:12:45,128 --> 01:12:46,106
Not like her.

1183
01:12:48,631 --> 01:12:52,204
Now bend your knee a little more.
Keep doing it, good..

1184
01:12:52,469 --> 01:12:53,709
Ravi.

1185
01:12:55,538 --> 01:12:56,346
Ravi isn't here?

1186
01:12:57,173 --> 01:12:58,777
Ravi. - Sister-in-law.

1187
01:13:01,244 --> 01:13:03,315
Ravi's right here,
he's getting a massage.

1188
01:13:03,413 --> 01:13:05,086
Fine, but why isn't he answering?

1189
01:13:05,148 --> 01:13:07,492
Tell me the truth,
or else I am coming in. - No, no.

1190
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:10,224
Don't come in,
ladies aren't allowed in here.

1191
01:13:10,286 --> 01:13:11,458
And we aren't wearing anything.

1192
01:13:11,554 --> 01:13:12,726
But why isn't he answering?

1193
01:13:13,122 --> 01:13:14,499
Sister-in-law,
he's lying on his stomach.

1194
01:13:14,757 --> 01:13:17,203
With his face in the pillow.
He can't talk.

1195
01:13:18,061 --> 01:13:20,302
Any message.
- Look. I am coming inside.

1196
01:13:20,363 --> 01:13:22,309
He can tell me in gestures
hovv long he's going to take.

1197
01:13:22,365 --> 01:13:23,742
Yeah..yeah..
just a second.

1198
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,775
Ravi, sister-in-law
is asking something.

1199
01:13:26,536 --> 01:13:29,039
Sister-in-law,
he's showing 5 fingers..3 times.

1200
01:13:29,539 --> 01:13:32,611
15 minutes. In the lobby.

1201
01:13:33,243 --> 01:13:34,381
Please tell him, Azhar.

1202
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:36,515
If he doesn't show
up in 15 minutes.

1203
01:13:36,546 --> 01:13:38,355
..then I won't care for anyone,
even you.

1204
01:13:38,448 --> 01:13:41,054
No more knocking, I'll barge
right in. - Yes, sister-in-lavv.

1205
01:13:41,117 --> 01:13:42,790
He'll get me killed someday.

1206
01:13:43,052 --> 01:13:45,259
Wipe the oi
..your
shirt will get ruined.

1207
01:13:45,521 --> 01:13:46,693
I can wash the shirt.

1208
01:13:46,756 --> 01:13:48,736
But if we get caught,
we're sure to get a whacking.

1209
01:13:50,626 --> 01:13:53,197
Sangeeta's room.
- Sir, room no. 723.

1210
01:13:53,396 --> 01:13:54,568
Open the door, Ravi!

1211
01:13:55,131 --> 01:13:55,734
Ravi!

1212
01:13:58,401 --> 01:14:00,472
What? I didn't order anything.

1213
01:14:01,371 --> 01:14:04,318
You're just as bad
as you're beautiful.

1214
01:14:04,374 --> 01:14:06,081
You should also try
doing some bad things..

1215
01:14:06,175 --> 01:14:08,018
..might make your
face better to look at.

1216
01:14:08,077 --> 01:14:10,489
My players are my responsibility.

1217
01:14:10,747 --> 01:14:13,125
I won't let you work
your charms on them.

1218
01:14:13,316 --> 01:14:16,627
We

..at least you admit
that I am charming.

1219
01:14:17,353 --> 01:14:19,128
Will you send Ravi
out or should I come in?

1220
01:14:20,023 --> 01:14:21,434
Ravi! Ravi!

1221
01:14:21,524 --> 01:14:24,266
That's a very unique e><cuse
for entering my room.

1222
01:14:24,393 --> 01:14:26,031
Stop acting in front of me.

1223
01:14:26,095 --> 01:14:27,267
Ravi's marriage will be at stake.

1224
01:14:27,530 --> 01:14:29,476
Look, go away now.

1225
01:14:29,532 --> 01:14:31,637
If someone sees you here
in this condition.

1226
01:14:32,034 --> 01:14:33,741
..then you and I will
become tomorrow's news.

1227
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:36,275
I won't leave without Ravi!

1228
01:14:38,574 --> 01:14:40,576
Ravi, are you coming out..or
should I call your wife?

1229
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:42,251
Ravi!

1230
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:44,318
Coming, Ajju.

1231
01:14:44,614 --> 01:14:46,252
Why call my wife?

1232
01:14:47,416 --> 01:14:48,360
on, m.

1233
01:14:49,385 --> 01:14:50,625
You're looking gorgeous.

1234
01:14:52,255 --> 01:14:53,791
Brother's choice is really good.

1235
01:15:01,230 --> 01:15:03,335
You should know
one thing about me.

1236
01:15:03,432 --> 01:15:07,972
I can never think about
two kind of guys in my life.

1237
01:15:08,137 --> 01:15:11,380
First, cricketers..and second,
married men.

1238
01:15:13,009 --> 01:15:14,317
‘I did make a mistake.‘

1239
01:15:14,444 --> 01:15:16,219
'..but I wasn't in the
mood to make another one..'

1240
01:15:16,279 --> 01:15:17,417
'..by admitting it.‘

1241
01:15:17,447 --> 01:15:20,724
‘All I knew vvas..
 didn't
vvant to see that face ever again.‘

1242
01:15:24,987 --> 01:15:26,227
I love you.

1243
01:15:28,992 --> 01:15:29,766
Cut it!

1244
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:32,098
Ma'am! Ma'am! Ma'am!

1245
01:15:32,995 --> 01:15:35,100
We must see the chemistry
between you two.

1246
01:15:35,164 --> 01:15:36,700
The love in your eyes.

1247
01:15:36,766 --> 01:15:39,372
Some faces only invoke anger.

1248
01:15:39,602 --> 01:15:40,774
Hovv can you see the love?

1249
01:15:41,304 --> 01:15:44,251
I never got so angry,
even when I got out on a duck.

1250
01:15:44,407 --> 01:15:46,284
Sir, do you know who he is?

1251
01:15:46,442 --> 01:15:47,477
Everyone knows him.

1252
01:15:47,610 --> 01:15:49,317
My son is a big fan his.

1253
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:50,652
He's a star batsman.

1254
01:15:50,780 --> 01:15:53,124
Not just a batsman,
but do you knovv..

1255
01:15:53,282 --> 01:15:55,455
..he's done a PhD on girls.

1256
01:15:55,518 --> 01:15:57,156
Crazy woman, blabbering nonsense.
- Sir..Sir..

1257
01:15:57,219 --> 01:16:00,325
Ma'am, let's just finish
this shoot properly.

1258
01:16:00,456 --> 01:16:03,027
Please cooperate. - Okay, sir.

1259
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:04,260
Only for you.

1260
01:16:04,594 --> 01:16:05,971
I am a professional.

1261
01:16:06,028 --> 01:16:06,665
Thank you.

1262
01:16:07,096 --> 01:16:08,040
Makeup.

1263
01:16:08,164 --> 01:16:10,474
Doesn't know a thing about
acting..alvvays dabbing makeup.

1264
01:16:11,067 --> 01:16:11,499
Action.

1265
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:13,502
The entire world is our fan..

1266
01:16:14,003 --> 01:16:16,074
But we are fans of Prayag.

1267
01:16:16,305 --> 01:16:19,548
Prayagfrouching lives every day.

1268
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:23,113
Smile. - What?

1269
01:16:23,279 --> 01:16:24,383
Smile.

1270
01:16:25,982 --> 01:16:27,017
Mood!

1271
01:16:28,985 --> 01:16:29,656
Cut it.

1272
01:16:30,653 --> 01:16:32,997
Even the villains in
my films have not been this bad.

1273
01:16:33,656 --> 01:16:35,533
I got stuck doing this ad with you.

1274
01:16:36,292 --> 01:16:37,327
What will the people say?

1275
01:16:37,660 --> 01:16:38,661
What kind of an actress is she?

1276
01:16:38,728 --> 01:16:40,298
No one thinks you're an actress.

1277
01:16:40,496 --> 01:16:43,477
We

..at least you'll get
some importance because of me.

1278
01:16:43,532 --> 01:16:45,375
Ma'am..please. . interview.

1279
01:16:45,435 --> 01:16:47,312
Please..one question.

1280
01:16:47,370 --> 01:16:48,508
No personal questions.

1281
01:16:48,537 --> 01:16:51,780
Ma'am, we've heard there's a
different heroine in your love-story.

1282
01:16:52,041 --> 01:16:55,579
Your relationship failed,
will it affect your career?

1283
01:16:55,678 --> 01:16:57,715
Ma'am, what do you have to say
about your relationship?

1284
01:16:58,481 --> 01:17:01,690
Ma'am, look here

1285
01:17:03,352 --> 01:17:04,228
Samar.

01:17:05,955 --> 01:17:07,593
ls the crew ready? - Yes.

1287
01:17:08,257 --> 01:17:10,294
Shall we take the shot again?
- Excellent.

1288
01:17:10,426 --> 01:17:12,463
Come on, guys!
We're going for another take.

1289
01:17:12,662 --> 01:17:14,573
Clear the field!
Clear it.

1290
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:18,305
I am from Zine magazine,
it's for our cover page, ma'am.

1291
01:17:18,367 --> 01:17:19,710
Excuse me..
Excuse me, ma'am..

1292
01:17:19,969 --> 01:17:24,349
If we have your permission..
then can we shoot?

1293
01:17:25,241 --> 01:17:27,380
Excuse me! Excuse us!

1294
01:17:27,543 --> 01:17:30,387
Compose yourself, we've to
take the shot again. - What now.

1295
01:17:30,446 --> 01:17:31,982
Just do as I say.

1296
01:17:33,349 --> 01:17:34,726
Action! - Come on.

1297
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:39,496
Sir, where are you going?

1298
01:17:45,461 --> 01:17:46,439
Over here.

1299
01:18:11,554 --> 01:18:13,033
I'm sorry.

1300
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:21,041
All these peop
e..
they just.

1301
01:18:31,107 --> 01:18:34,247
Don't let people's negativity
bring you down.

1302
01:18:48,090 --> 01:18:49,467
You've a wife, right?

1303
01:18:51,527 --> 01:18:52,528
Yeah.

1304
01:18:54,363 --> 01:18:56,570
You've given her your name.

1305
01:18:57,733 --> 01:19:00,145
Don't ever let her down.

1306
01:19:06,309 --> 01:19:09,950
‘I came back home,
Naureen was with me. Near me.‘

1307
01:19:10,246 --> 01:19:13,090
‘But there was still a restlessness
that kept increasing.‘

1308
01:19:13,315 --> 01:19:14,589
You can't sleep?

1309
01:19:15,518 --> 01:19:20,058
Feels 
ike..we're close,
but not together.

1310
01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:24,570
I am right here.

1311
01:19:28,164 --> 01:19:29,370
Now go to sleep.

1312
01:19:31,233 --> 01:19:32,541
I feel scared.

1313
01:19:33,703 --> 01:19:35,080
Of what?

1314
01:19:36,539 --> 01:19:38,018
My dreams.

1315
01:19:40,576 --> 01:19:45,116
I am scared to dream of things
I shouldn't dream of.

1316
01:19:55,357 --> 01:19:57,030
‘You've given her your name.‘

1317
01:19:58,594 --> 01:20:00,471
‘Don't ever let her down.‘

1318
01:20:07,770 --> 01:20:10,717
Are you going out? - Not me, we are.

1319
01:20:11,307 --> 01:20:13,719
Get ready. We'll go watch a film.

1320
01:20:14,376 --> 01:20:16,356
I see..which one.

1321
01:20:17,413 --> 01:20:19,723
Something that makes you happy.

1322
01:20:20,249 --> 01:20:21,660
And I'll be happy
seeing you haPPY-

1323
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:49,280
She's so beautiful.

1324
01:20:50,146 --> 01:20:52,558
And look at her eyes..so pretty.

1325
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:56,527
"Time has given the signal."

1326
01:20:56,652 --> 01:20:58,063
What?

1327
01:21:01,123 --> 01:21:04,070
Why should I look at her eyes?

1328
01:21:06,095 --> 01:21:07,369
Did I come here to see her eyes?

1329
01:21:07,496 --> 01:21:11,308
"The hunter will become the hunted."

1330
01:21:11,534 --> 01:21:13,138
I'm watching the film.

1331
01:21:15,104 --> 01:21:18,449
"This scene will change completely."

1332
01:21:18,507 --> 01:21:22,250
"Time has given the signal."

1333
01:21:43,332 --> 01:21:45,175
Dear, please come here.

1334
01:21:45,234 --> 01:21:46,713
I'll be right back.

1335
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:56,719
‘And now on Bollywood Ivlasala,
this week's number 1 song..'

1336
01:21:57,813 --> 01:22:00,123
"Destiny always plays games with you."

1337
01:22:00,449 --> 01:22:02,122
"It never gives
you what you want."

1338
01:22:02,985 --> 01:22:04,521
"And the one
You keep running from.."

1339
01:22:04,553 --> 01:22:06,692
"..is always just around the corner."

1340
01:22:25,207 --> 01:22:28,381
The captain's getting quite
popular amongst the women.

1341
01:22:28,577 --> 01:22:30,716
He recently did
an ad with Sangeeta.

1342
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:32,354
It's all thanks to that.

1343
01:22:33,215 --> 01:22:36,355
Remember what a stir
his '
\/Iacho' ad created.

1344
01:22:52,301 --> 01:22:55,248
Azhar, my son wants to meet you.

1345
01:22:55,304 --> 01:22:58,148
He says he'll grow up
to be a batsman like you.

1346
01:22:58,807 --> 01:22:59,785
I'll be right back.

1347
01:23:03,179 --> 01:23:05,489
Sangeeta,
someone's here to see you.

1348
01:23:09,752 --> 01:23:10,526
You?

1349
01:23:13,022 --> 01:23:13,727
Here?

1350
01:23:14,390 --> 01:23:15,425
You can't be here.

1351
01:23:16,058 --> 01:23:17,162
Hovv did you come here?

1352
01:23:17,693 --> 01:23:19,764
I just found out.

1353
01:23:20,029 --> 01:23:21,269
This is my friend's home.

1354
01:23:21,463 --> 01:23:23,067
So please, don't embarrass me.

1355
01:23:23,332 --> 01:23:25,369
I want to talk to you..
- If you don't leave now..

1356
01:23:26,068 --> 01:23:28,446
I'll call your wife. Please.

1357
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:30,005
Tell her.

1358
01:23:30,272 --> 01:23:32,411
If you don't, then I will.
- Hovv can you say this?

1359
01:23:32,541 --> 01:23:33,576
You're married.

1360
01:23:33,642 --> 01:23:35,679
Sangeeta, since I've met you..

1361
01:23:36,078 --> 01:23:37,489
..
 see just one face everywhere.

1362
01:23:37,546 --> 01:23:40,083
Only one name that I hear.
- This is wrong.

1363
01:23:40,182 --> 01:23:41,286
This is all wrong.

1364
01:23:41,483 --> 01:23:42,791
Go away, please.

1365
01:23:43,185 --> 01:23:45,028
I wouldn't have come here,
if I could help it.

1366
01:23:45,621 --> 01:23:48,124
Please, you're
complicating the situation.

1367
01:23:48,357 --> 01:23:49,631
Now please just go.
Please go

1368
01:23:49,758 --> 01:23:51,203
Just go now.

1369
01:23:52,728 --> 01:23:53,468
Sangeeta!

1370
01:24:09,078 --> 01:24:11,581
No Azhar, I can't!

1371
01:24:22,457 --> 01:24:25,495
"Don't love me so much.."

1372
01:24:25,561 --> 01:24:26,665
I told you to leave, didn't l?

1373
01:24:27,563 --> 01:24:32,342
"..that I might drown in it."

1374
01:24:32,401 --> 01:24:36,042
No, no, this is wrong.

1375
01:24:36,338 --> 01:24:43,779
"And forget..how to get
back to the shore again."

1376
01:24:44,113 --> 01:24:49,358
"Since I saw your face."

1377
01:24:49,585 --> 01:24:55,035
"..
 haven't slept for weeks."

1378
01:24:58,093 --> 01:25:00,630
"Say it, please."

1379
01:25:00,696 --> 01:25:03,336
"..vvhatever's in your heart."

1380
01:25:03,465 --> 01:25:08,710
"
 won't tell anyone, I promise."

1381
01:25:09,138 --> 01:25:11,675
"Say it, please."

1382
01:25:12,007 --> 01:25:14,487
"..vvhatever's in your heart."

1383
01:25:14,543 --> 01:25:19,720
"
 won't tell anyone, I promise."

1384
01:25:20,249 --> 01:25:26,165
"
 won't tell anyone, I promise."

1385
01:25:51,146 --> 01:25:56,596
"
 can't sleep alone."

1386
01:25:56,785 --> 01:26:01,393
"Come in my dreams."

1387
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:07,607
"
 can't walk without you.."

1388
01:26:07,696 --> 01:26:12,611
"..be my SUPPOW"

1389
01:26:12,668 --> 01:26:17,668
"Other than loving
you..there's nothing I can do."

1390
01:26:26,582 --> 01:26:29,324
"Say it, please."

1391
01:26:29,451 --> 01:26:32,227
"..vvhatever's in your heart."

1392
01:26:32,287 --> 01:26:37,532
"
 won't tell anyone, I promise."

1393
01:26:37,726 --> 01:26:40,434
"Say it, please."

1394
01:26:40,562 --> 01:26:43,304
"..vvhatever's in your heart."

1395
01:26:43,365 --> 01:26:48,678
"
 won't tell anyone, I promise."

1396
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:54,652
"
 won't tell anyone, I promise."

1397
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:22,010
"Say it, please."

1398
01:27:22,137 --> 01:27:24,640
"..vvhatever's in your heart."

1399
01:27:24,706 --> 01:27:30,122
"
 won't tell anyone, I promise."

1400
01:27:30,245 --> 01:27:33,055
"Say it, please."

1401
01:27:33,115 --> 01:27:35,618
"..vvhatever's in your heart."

1402
01:27:35,684 --> 01:27:41,259
"
 won't tell anyone, I promise."

1403
01:27:41,356 --> 01:27:46,567
"
 won't tell anyone, I promise."

1404
01:28:00,042 --> 01:28:01,316
Nice house.

1405
01:28:01,643 --> 01:28:03,122
A house like this, in London.

1406
01:28:03,378 --> 01:28:04,254
Not bad.

1407
01:28:04,313 --> 01:28:05,348
Don't you just love it?

1408
01:28:05,581 --> 01:28:07,151
It belongs to my friend.

1409
01:28:07,649 --> 01:28:09,390
I am so bored of hotels.

1410
01:28:09,985 --> 01:28:11,965
You don't get
such privacy in hotels.

1411
01:28:12,321 --> 01:28:14,198
Away from prying eyes..

1412
01:28:14,389 --> 01:28:15,629
Perfect hideaway.

1413
01:28:17,493 --> 01:28:20,030
Hovv is he? - Who?

1414
01:28:20,128 --> 01:28:23,598
Come on, the whole world
is talking about the two of you.

1415
01:28:24,032 --> 01:28:25,238
Why are you hiding it from me?

1416
01:28:25,334 --> 01:28:27,280
You know I don't like
discussing personal stuff.

1417
01:28:27,369 --> 01:28:28,609
Darling.

1418
01:28:29,505 --> 01:28:31,644
He's the captain of the
Indian Cricket Team.

1419
01:28:32,107 --> 01:28:34,280
And you're such a big actress.

1420
01:28:35,177 --> 01:28:36,713
It's not personal anymore.

1421
01:28:38,647 --> 01:28:40,991
Anyway. I am only
giving you a heads-up.

1422
01:28:41,683 --> 01:28:43,458
You two will be featured
as the cover story.

1423
01:28:43,518 --> 01:28:45,429
..in my magazine's ne><t issue..

1424
01:28:45,621 --> 01:28:46,691
Be careful.

1425
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:51,429
People will talk..point fingers.

1426
01:28:51,593 --> 01:28:53,630
If pointing fingers was a crime..

1427
01:28:54,029 --> 01:28:55,565
..then half the world
would be in jail.

1428
01:28:55,997 --> 01:29:00,412
If breaking a heart was a crime,
then too!

1429
01:29:09,544 --> 01:29:14,357
Necklace..bag..vvatch..the best.

1430
01:29:15,450 --> 01:29:18,693
Send everything to madam's
house in an hour. - Yes.

1431
01:29:20,622 --> 01:29:23,034
Hello, Azhar.

1432
01:29:24,159 --> 01:29:25,160
Hello.

1433
01:29:25,327 --> 01:29:26,431
What brings you here?

1434
01:29:27,029 --> 01:29:29,703
Well, this is Shawn.

1435
01:29:30,065 --> 01:29:31,066
..and he's a big diamond trader.

1436
01:29:31,133 --> 01:29:32,407
And a good friend.

1437
01:29:32,567 --> 01:29:33,511
Hello. - Hello.

1438
01:29:33,669 --> 01:29:36,707
He has a proposal for you.

1439
01:29:38,140 --> 01:29:40,017
Since he was in London,
and so were you I thought I

1440
01:29:40,075 --> 01:29:41,452
..wou
d introduce the two of you.

1441
01:29:43,345 --> 01:29:45,291
I am a big fan of yours.

1442
01:29:47,749 --> 01:29:50,286
If this is about an ad,
then I can't do it now.

1443
01:29:50,986 --> 01:29:52,260
The Jubilee Cup is coming up.

1444
01:29:52,321 --> 01:29:54,358
So it's difficult
to spare any time.

1445
01:29:55,590 --> 01:29:58,469
Fine..it's alright.

1446
01:29:58,660 --> 01:30:02,005
But since we're already here..

1447
01:30:02,064 --> 01:30:05,273
..if you can spare five minutes.

1448
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:08,381
You can see hovv
busy I am right now.

1449
01:30:09,204 --> 01:30:10,512
No, you're right.

1450
01:30:10,605 --> 01:30:14,018
We'll meet some other day
and talk when you're comfortable.

1451
01:30:14,076 --> 01:30:15,555
l'll explain everything in detail.

1452
01:30:16,211 --> 01:30:18,657
See you. - See you.

1453
01:30:33,695 --> 01:30:35,697
I've been trying to talk
to you for so many days.

1454
01:30:36,431 --> 01:30:37,739
Even called you so many times.

1455
01:30:40,135 --> 01:30:41,045
I love you.

1456
01:30:56,618 --> 01:31:00,156
Azhanrelations like ours,
don't get much respect.

1457
01:31:01,056 --> 01:31:02,501
Think about it once.

1458
01:31:02,991 --> 01:31:04,368
Love never gives you time to think.

1459
01:31:04,593 --> 01:31:06,038
This will end lot of things.

1460
01:31:06,094 --> 01:31:07,198
But I will have you.

1461
01:31:07,262 --> 01:31:10,732
With this decision you could
lose a lot more than you would gain.

1462
01:31:11,533 --> 01:31:13,206
Go back home.

1463
01:31:15,270 --> 01:31:16,271
Please.

1464
01:31:19,141 --> 01:31:20,313
Just go.

1465
01:31:30,118 --> 01:31:32,223
‘She didn't want to break my family.‘

1466
01:31:32,387 --> 01:31:34,389
‘And I didn't want to go back home.‘

1467
01:31:35,057 --> 01:31:36,263
'But..
 had to!‘

1468
01:31:57,279 --> 01:31:58,587
How's the Biryani.

1469
01:32:00,315 --> 01:32:01,453
It's nice.

1470
01:32:05,053 --> 01:32:05,724
What's nice?

1471
01:32:06,388 --> 01:32:08,561
The mutton..spices. . rice?

1472
01:32:11,426 --> 01:32:13,372
We

..every thing's nice.

1473
01:32:17,666 --> 01:32:20,374
Naureen,
why don't we ever talk much?

1474
01:32:21,303 --> 01:32:23,078
There's so much to talk about.

1475
01:32:23,638 --> 01:32:26,744
I've come back after so long.
There must be something.

1476
01:32:27,475 --> 01:32:29,614
You can scold me if nothing else?

1477
01:32:36,251 --> 01:32:37,389
Your co

ar..

1478
01:32:39,020 --> 01:32:41,466
Lower it ..doesn't
look nice this way.

1479
01:33:02,043 --> 01:33:03,181
Azhar's here.

1480
01:33:03,712 --> 01:33:04,486
Greetings. - Greetings.

1481
01:33:04,513 --> 01:33:06,254
Take a seat, son.

1482
01:33:06,514 --> 01:33:07,652
Greetings. - Greetings.

1483
01:33:09,417 --> 01:33:11,419
I've something
important to say to you.

1484
01:33:12,454 --> 01:33:14,195
Not now, I am busy.

1485
01:33:15,757 --> 01:33:17,031
Forget your work.

1486
01:33:17,492 --> 01:33:19,267
I've been trying to
talk to you for four days.

1487
01:33:19,561 --> 01:33:21,097
..but you don't have time.

1488
01:33:23,098 --> 01:33:23,735
I'll be right back.

1489
01:33:24,065 --> 01:33:25,237
You stay here.

1490
01:33:26,167 --> 01:33:27,612
Why are you behaving like a child?

1491
01:33:30,572 --> 01:33:32,677
There are so many
guests in the house.

1492
01:33:33,074 --> 01:33:35,748
Why don't you talk to them?
I am not going anywhere.

1493
01:33:36,011 --> 01:33:37,081
Greetings. - Greetings.

1494
01:33:40,182 --> 01:33:41,661
But I am leaving soon.

1495
01:33:42,117 --> 01:33:43,528
My new series
is about to begin.

1496
01:33:43,752 --> 01:33:45,789
Are you worried about packing?
- Naureen, 
..

1497
01:33:46,054 --> 01:33:47,533
Don't vvorry.

1498
01:33:48,256 --> 01:33:50,099
Just go inside and rest.

1499
01:33:50,358 --> 01:33:53,168
Nothing's more important
than your new series.

1500
01:33:53,228 --> 01:33:54,434
Naureen, can you come here please?

1501
01:33:54,596 --> 01:33:55,597
Coming.

1502
01:34:05,607 --> 01:34:09,020
‘I left for the series without
saying anything to Naureen .'

1503
01:34:09,577 --> 01:34:10,988
‘But it felt wrong.‘

1504
01:34:12,514 --> 01:34:19,022
‘And notjust Naureen..
 had
to tell the whole world.‘

1505
01:34:24,125 --> 01:34:26,503
And Azhar make a another century.

1506
01:34:26,528 --> 01:34:29,008
Very well deserve hundred by Azhar.

1507
01:34:29,064 --> 01:34:30,668
He has made the country proud.

1508
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:34,376
Presenting the indian captain Azhar.

1509
01:34:39,341 --> 01:34:40,752
What would you like to say
about your innings?

1510
01:34:41,443 --> 01:34:44,686
When the entire
country's supporting you..

1511
01:34:44,746 --> 01:34:46,783
..you get the
courage to play well.

1512
01:34:47,048 --> 01:34:51,690
You've to be honest to your fans,
and to your game.

1513
01:34:53,221 --> 01:34:58,193
And today..my fans are right here,
and so is this game.

1514
01:35:00,228 --> 01:35:03,539
If I don't say it in front of
them, then who else will I say it to?

1515
01:35:05,567 --> 01:35:09,481
I want to dedicate this
award to somebody very special.

1516
01:35:11,005 --> 01:35:14,043
Sangeetafrhis one's for you!

1517
01:35:22,250 --> 01:35:28,257
"The tears brimming in my eyes,
run deeper than the ocean."

1518
01:35:28,323 --> 01:35:34,501
"Even God knovvs..why it's so."

1519
01:35:34,663 --> 01:35:39,612
"You don't think about me.."

1520
01:35:39,701 --> 01:35:46,084
"Every leaf knows my condition."

1521
01:35:46,141 --> 01:35:51,648
"You don't know
what I'm going through."

1522
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:58,188
Today for the first time..
 only
thought about myself.

1523
01:35:58,453 --> 01:36:00,592
You didn't think
about your family.

1524
01:36:02,123 --> 01:36:03,295
You shou
d've thought once..

1525
01:36:03,358 --> 01:36:05,133
..before dedicating
the match to her, that.

1526
01:36:05,627 --> 01:36:08,233
..your name is attached to mine.

1527
01:36:09,731 --> 01:36:11,711
You just announced
it to the world.

1528
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:16,247
It would've taken longer
to say it in person.

1529
01:36:18,606 --> 01:36:20,051
It felt like the right time.

1530
01:36:22,711 --> 01:36:24,281
And the truth was out.

1531
01:36:24,445 --> 01:36:26,391
When you won your first
‘Man of the Match‘ trophy..

1532
01:36:26,414 --> 01:36:27,688
..was she with you, or was it me?

1533
01:36:27,982 --> 01:36:30,258
All night, when you would toss
and turn because of your bad form..

1534
01:36:30,318 --> 01:36:31,592
..was she with you, or was it me?

1535
01:36:31,986 --> 01:36:34,330
I prayed for your success!

1536
01:36:35,590 --> 01:36:39,402
And today..you have left me behind.

1537
01:36:48,770 --> 01:36:50,511
I'll do whatever you say.

1538
01:36:51,539 --> 01:36:54,713
I won't go anywhere if you tell me not to.
- Then don't go, Azhar.

1539
01:36:55,043 --> 01:36:56,420
Stay right here, at home.

1540
01:36:56,578 --> 01:36:58,353
In front of me.

1541
01:37:05,453 --> 01:37:07,160
But what I actually want.

1542
01:37:08,390 --> 01:37:11,599
..is for you to live happily,
while you're with me.

1543
01:37:13,394 --> 01:37:15,431
And not due
to some helplessness.

1544
01:37:16,731 --> 01:37:22,647
"Every leaf knows."

1545
01:37:24,739 --> 01:37:27,652
‘I left her..but
I couldn't leave her.‘

1546
01:37:28,710 --> 01:37:30,519
‘She's like some bad habit.‘

1547
01:37:31,512 --> 01:37:34,049
I didn't marry her
to break her heart.

1548
01:37:34,683 --> 01:37:37,095
What I did to Naureen wasn't right.

1549
01:37:37,652 --> 01:37:39,427
Maybe that's why
I am in this condition today.

1550
01:37:39,587 --> 01:37:43,729
Look, those ‘set in stone‘
days are over.

1551
01:37:44,092 --> 01:37:46,072
Change is the reality of life.

1552
01:37:46,127 --> 01:37:48,232
Reddy, I won't change my decision!

1553
01:37:48,363 --> 01:37:50,274
Sangeeta won't come to the court,
do you get that?

1554
01:37:50,331 --> 01:37:52,368
You can try your best
to conceal her name.

1555
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:54,411
But lvleera's definitely
going to use it.

1556
01:38:01,376 --> 01:38:04,255
Your honor,
if someone falls down on the road..

1557
01:38:05,113 --> 01:38:08,492
..then at least a few passer-bys
step-up to help him.

1558
01:38:09,484 --> 01:38:12,294
This case has been
going on for 8 years.

1559
01:38:13,388 --> 01:38:15,595
But no one has shown up yet.

1560
01:38:16,424 --> 01:38:18,062
Not even his wife.

1561
01:38:19,094 --> 01:38:24,442
Neither Sangeeta,
nor Naureen..or his family.

1562
01:38:25,033 --> 01:38:28,105
No fans..or friends.

1563
01:38:28,636 --> 01:38:32,083
Right, 
\/Ir. Reddy?
Did anyone show up?

1564
01:38:32,307 --> 01:38:33,513
Actually.

1565
01:38:33,575 --> 01:38:37,648
He played cricket for so
many years..earned so much fame.

1566
01:38:38,413 --> 01:38:42,020
..but couldn't make a single friend
who would stand by him.

1567
01:38:42,984 --> 01:38:44,520
What could be the reason?

1568
01:38:47,321 --> 01:38:50,097
Actually.
- The reason is clear, your honor.

1569
01:38:50,391 --> 01:38:54,134
Because everyone believes
that Azhar is guilty.

1570
01:38:54,729 --> 01:38:56,606
And that Azhar is behind it all.

1571
01:38:57,132 --> 01:38:59,408
And so they have
refused to support him.

1572
01:39:02,537 --> 01:39:03,607
You're quiet, 
\/Ir. Reddy.

1573
01:39:05,607 --> 01:39:10,454
This means you agree with.
- Actually.

1574
01:39:10,945 --> 01:39:12,219
Your honor..

1575
01:39:12,347 --> 01:39:14,657
..it's not enough to ban such a man.

1576
01:39:15,216 --> 01:39:16,593
In fact, he should be jailed.

1577
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:21,630
So that it serves as a warning
to all the other players.

1578
01:39:22,156 --> 01:39:24,534
And they never resort
to match-fixing.

1579
01:39:25,393 --> 01:39:26,428
That's all, your honor.

1580
01:39:31,065 --> 01:39:33,238

\/Ir. Reddy, do you have any witness?

1581
01:39:35,303 --> 01:39:36,373

\/Ir. Reddy.

1582
01:39:38,006 --> 01:39:39,041
Sorry, your honor.

1583
01:39:40,709 --> 01:39:43,519
Your honor,
this case is still in our hands.

1584
01:39:43,578 --> 01:39:45,990
..because you haven't
given your verdict yet.

1585
01:39:46,648 --> 01:39:49,561
I would request you
give to give another date.

1586
01:39:49,984 --> 01:39:53,431
..and then you can give
your verdict. Please?

1587
01:39:54,121 --> 01:39:58,035
Okay, there has been way too many
hearings already regarding this case.

1588
01:39:58,493 --> 01:40:00,063
8th November.

1589
01:40:00,628 --> 01:40:02,608
After that I'll be giving my verdict.

1590
01:40:03,030 --> 01:40:04,703
No more dates.
- Thank you, your honor.

1591
01:40:05,066 --> 01:40:06,636
The court is adjourned
till the ne><t date.

1592
01:40:09,437 --> 01:40:11,075
The countdown has begun.

1593
01:40:11,138 --> 01:40:14,119
Finally you will be charged
guilty for all the accusations.

1594
01:40:14,476 --> 01:40:17,423
Ivleera, why do I feel
that you're my biggest fan?

1595
01:40:17,745 --> 01:40:20,123
I was. - Doesn't take time
for the winds to change.

1596
01:40:20,381 --> 01:40:21,485
You will be my fan again.

1597
01:40:21,649 --> 01:40:24,186
You can't fi>< anything here.

1598
01:40:25,153 --> 01:40:26,291
I don't understand one thing.

1599
01:40:27,021 --> 01:40:30,559
I gave you some money
before the case started.

1600
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:34,706
You kept the money and you're
still fighting against me.

1601
01:40:35,397 --> 01:40:36,467
What nonsense is this?

1602
01:40:36,698 --> 01:40:38,200
You're being absurd.

1603
01:40:38,366 --> 01:40:41,677
There's a similar
rage filled inside me.

1604
01:40:42,303 --> 01:40:46,615
False accusations are made
every day in your courtrooms.

1605
01:40:47,275 --> 01:40:49,186
And the honest ones
have to save thier heads.

1606
01:40:56,284 --> 01:41:00,130
Look Azhar, if this had
just been about ball-tampering.

1607
01:41:00,455 --> 01:41:02,128
..
 would've stood right beside you.

1608
01:41:03,657 --> 01:41:05,534
If this had been about s
edging..

1609
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:08,001
..then I would've fought for you,
I swear.

1610
01:41:08,462 --> 01:41:13,172
But I don't want to get involved
in the mess you're in.

1611
01:41:13,401 --> 01:41:14,379
Please try to understand.

1612
01:41:14,435 --> 01:41:16,005
okay, bye-

1613
01:41:22,043 --> 01:41:23,579
The accusations are
quite serious, Ajju.

1614
01:41:24,145 --> 01:41:27,092
Those who will stand with you,
will be accused as well.

1615
01:41:27,281 --> 01:41:29,693
I am getting married,
I've to make a living.

1616
01:41:30,118 --> 01:41:32,120
Your son wanted to be like me.

1617
01:41:32,187 --> 01:41:34,497
Since the day I read your news
I put him in acting school.

1618
01:41:34,589 --> 01:41:36,591
Now he'll become an actor.
- Best of luck.

1619
01:41:36,657 --> 01:41:37,635
Here's a peice of advice for you.

1620
01:41:38,259 --> 01:41:41,069
I've a friend.
He's opening a gym.

1621
01:41:41,129 --> 01:41:44,110
He needs a celebrity
for his gym's inauguration.

1622
01:41:44,365 --> 01:41:46,470
I can speak to him for you.

1623
01:41:51,138 --> 01:41:51,707
VVhat..vvhat happened?

1624
01:41:51,773 --> 01:41:52,683
Azhar..

1625
01:41:52,741 --> 01:41:54,414
It's hard to kill time here..

1626
01:41:54,542 --> 01:41:56,385
..and he wants me to cut ribbons.

1627
01:41:56,444 --> 01:41:57,548
Ribbon?

1628
01:41:57,712 --> 01:41:59,282
Not bad idea.

1629
01:42:00,047 --> 01:42:01,549
You want me to cut
ribbons in this condition.

1630
01:42:01,616 --> 01:42:04,187
Azhar, we'll have
to do everything we can.

1631
01:42:04,619 --> 01:42:08,499
Such publicity can be
good for our case. - How?

1632
01:42:08,990 --> 01:42:11,630
Look, if you're seen
amongst public again..

1633
01:42:11,692 --> 01:42:15,572
..they they might start thinking
about you the way they used to.

1634
01:42:16,497 --> 01:42:21,105
Maybe this ribbon cutting can mark
the beginning of your good innings.

1635
01:42:23,638 --> 01:42:25,140
Please, brother.

1636
01:42:28,275 --> 01:42:29,618
‘This is what was missing.‘

1637
01:42:30,211 --> 01:42:31,417
‘This is my reality.‘

1638
01:42:31,579 --> 01:42:34,560
‘The crovvd..people
cheering my name.‘

1639
01:42:34,616 --> 01:42:36,027
'..their madness.‘

1640
01:42:36,083 --> 01:42:37,323
‘This is what I was.‘

1641
01:42:39,187 --> 01:42:41,599
lvlust be experiencing all this
after really long, isn't it?

1642
01:42:41,789 --> 01:42:43,700
Reminded you of your good old days,
haven't l?

1643
01:42:44,025 --> 01:42:45,231
Hovv are you feeling?

1644
01:42:45,393 --> 01:42:48,533
I am what I am because of my fans.

1645
01:42:48,663 --> 01:42:50,665
Then hovv about you shake a leg.

1646
01:42:51,032 --> 01:42:52,272
And let people see
that side of you too.

1647
01:42:54,368 --> 01:42:55,676
Let's save the dance
for your first anniversary.

1648
01:42:56,204 --> 01:42:58,206
And settle for autographs for now.

1649
01:43:01,742 --> 01:43:04,018
You're the first one to enter the gym.

1650
01:43:04,245 --> 01:43:05,690
So you're supposed
to wear this gym jacket.

1651
01:43:06,313 --> 01:43:08,122
No, the b
azer's fine.

1652
01:43:08,416 --> 01:43:09,520
I am not asking.

1653
01:43:10,084 --> 01:43:11,586
You should be seen
wearing the gym's name.

1654
01:43:11,653 --> 01:43:13,724
..whi
e cutting the ribbon.

1655
01:43:14,289 --> 01:43:16,667
And it's always the
client's preference, right?

1656
01:43:17,191 --> 01:43:18,499
Come on, wear it.

1657
01:43:19,593 --> 01:43:21,436
Everyone wants it.
Come on, wear it.

1658
01:43:24,132 --> 01:43:25,042
Great.

1659
01:43:28,669 --> 01:43:29,670
Here you go.

1660
01:43:35,042 --> 01:43:36,077
Good!

1661
01:43:36,444 --> 01:43:37,616
Come on, start!

1662
01:43:44,285 --> 01:43:46,162
Let us show you.

1663
01:43:46,220 --> 01:43:49,633
Batting! Batting!

1664
01:43:50,158 --> 01:43:52,604
We

..how about you show
us some of your flick-shots.

1665
01:43:54,062 --> 01:43:56,235
This isn't the place to bat.

1666
01:43:56,598 --> 01:43:59,204
You're Azhar. You can bat anywhere.

1667
01:44:00,268 --> 01:44:01,645
Yes..your batting.

1668
01:44:03,004 --> 01:44:05,575
I mean..if you don't
show us your shots.

1669
01:44:06,040 --> 01:44:08,145
..then what's the point
of calling you here?

1670
01:44:08,676 --> 01:44:12,419
Come on, show us some
of your goods shots.

1671
01:44:12,747 --> 01:44:13,589
I can't do it.

1672
01:44:14,248 --> 01:44:15,659
Stop showing attitude
and hold the bat.

1673
01:44:34,502 --> 01:44:37,244
Come on..vvhat are you doing?

1674
01:44:37,638 --> 01:44:40,482

game speak for you.‘

‘If you yell and scream,
only a few will listen..'

1677
01:44:53,421 --> 01:44:54,798
I can't do it!

1678
01:44:57,158 --> 01:44:59,263
Anyone will come up
and ask me to hold the bat.

1679
01:45:00,194 --> 01:45:01,730
I am a sportsman, not a monkey.

1680
01:45:02,296 --> 01:45:03,468
I can't do tricks.

1681
01:45:05,633 --> 01:45:06,509
Get lost.

1682
01:45:06,700 --> 01:45:09,010
It's wrong to take
pity on people like you.

1683

"Even the sky gets defeated.
Spends time on the ground."

"Dreaming to achieve
those heights again."

1685
01:45:24,352 --> 01:45:27,561
"When life shatters.
All hopes are lost."

1686
01:45:27,688 --> 01:45:29,224
‘Today I've nothing left.‘

1687
01:45:29,757 --> 01:45:32,260
‘But I am happy..nothing
makes a difference to me.‘

1688
01:45:32,627 --> 01:45:37,337
‘And there comes a change in life
when nothing matters anymore.‘

1689
01:45:38,533 --> 01:45:45,712
"My heart will soar again.
in the sky."

1690
01:45:45,773 --> 01:45:52,520
"The heartvvill battle with
the two worlds again."

1691
01:45:53,648 --> 01:45:57,289
"To win again."

‘A coin has two
sidesheads and tails.‘

1693
01:46:02,222 --> 01:46:06,432
‘But destiny favors
those who make a comeback.‘

1694
01:46:08,529 --> 01:46:11,703
"To win again."

1695
01:46:25,213 --> 01:46:29,320
"To win again."

1696
01:46:39,093 --> 01:46:45,374
Ivleera, you were my junior in London.
And you still are.

1697
01:46:45,566 --> 01:46:48,308
Yes, 
\/Ir. Reddy.

Witness..

1700
01:46:56,777 --> 01:47:01,487
Your honor, I would like
to call upon a witness.

1701
01:47:02,116 --> 01:47:04,596
..who is Azhar's biggest fan.
- Objection.

1702
01:47:05,085 --> 01:47:07,122
His biggest fan will
only speak in his favor.

1703
01:47:07,187 --> 01:47:08,257
This will be misleading, your honor.

1704
01:47:08,322 --> 01:47:10,996
Your honor, at least give me the
opportunity to call my witness.

1705
01:47:11,058 --> 01:47:14,733
If you feel thier statement is
misleading, you can dismiss it.

1706
01:47:14,995 --> 01:47:17,066
But Your honour, such a witness.
- Overruled.

1707
01:47:17,464 --> 01:47:21,708

\/Ir. Reddy, you can call your witness.
- Thank you, your honor.

1708
01:47:22,136 --> 01:47:24,582
By the way,
I don't need to call her..

1709
01:47:24,638 --> 01:47:26,982
..just request her.

1710
01:47:29,176 --> 01:47:33,181
The witness‘ name is..
Ms. Ivleera Verma.

1711
01:47:33,647 --> 01:47:34,557

1712
01:47:38,752 --> 01:47:40,629
The defense lawyer as a witness.

1713
01:47:40,721 --> 01:47:44,669
This has never happened before.
- It has, your honor.

1988..Carlson Vs Loraz
Disposal Services Ltd.

1715
01:47:56,403 --> 01:47:59,111
This example is from
a lawsuit in Canada.

1716
01:47:59,239 --> 01:48:02,448
Your honor, the court's
duty is to serve justice.

1717
01:48:02,944 --> 01:48:05,049
Whether it's India or Canada,
justice is justice.

1718
01:48:05,112 --> 01:48:11,085
And you must admit that my
witness..won't mislead the court.

1719
01:48:14,254 --> 01:48:15,665
I will allow it.

1720
01:48:15,990 --> 01:48:18,971
Ms. Ivleera, will you please step into
the witness stand?

1721
01:48:19,026 --> 01:48:20,096
Yes, your honor.

1722
01:48:24,565 --> 01:48:28,377
So Ms. Ivleera, hovv does it feel
when you have to answer questions.

1723
01:48:28,435 --> 01:48:29,505
..instead of asking them?

1724
01:48:29,670 --> 01:48:31,547
Just do yourjob, 
\/Ir. Reddy.

1725
01:48:34,274 --> 01:48:37,255
I'll speak the truth,
and nothing but the truth.

1726
01:48:37,478 --> 01:48:42,552
Meera..you're a big
fan of Azhar. - Was!

1727
01:48:42,616 --> 01:48:44,425
Sorry, you were.

1728
01:48:46,153 --> 01:48:49,532
So you knovv..vvinning and losing
is a part of the game.

1729
01:48:49,623 --> 01:48:52,604
Yes..one team wins
and the other team loses.

1730
01:48:53,060 --> 01:48:56,667
So all the cricket matches that
the Indian team has lost till date.

1731
01:48:57,231 --> 01:48:58,676
..must been fixed.

1732
01:48:58,732 --> 01:49:00,268
I didn't say that.

1733
01:49:01,001 --> 01:49:05,108
So, the three matches which
my client's been accused of fi><ing..

1734
01:49:05,306 --> 01:49:08,480
..cou
d've been natural defeats.

1735
01:49:08,576 --> 01:49:12,023
But we have CBI reports
of all three matches.

1736
01:49:12,513 --> 01:49:14,083
CBI reports?

1737
01:49:14,481 --> 01:49:16,427
Hovv did CBI prepare these reports?

1738
01:49:16,583 --> 01:49:18,324
On the basis of the sting operation.

1739
01:49:18,385 --> 01:49:19,728
Sting operation.

1740
01:49:20,221 --> 01:49:22,030
Your honor, please take note.

1741
01:49:22,156 --> 01:49:23,567
Please take note..

1742
01:49:24,058 --> 01:49:26,629
Ms. Ivleera, there's one
detail that's bothering me.

1743
01:49:27,027 --> 01:49:32,670
Before the proceedings, you
were forcing Azhar..to take an oath.

1744
01:49:32,733 --> 01:49:33,507
Absolutely.

1745
01:49:33,534 --> 01:49:36,310
"
'

 speak the truth,
and nothing but the truth."

1746
01:49:36,403 --> 01:49:37,143
What was the reason for this?

1747
01:49:37,204 --> 01:49:39,115
Because this is a court proceeding.

1748
01:49:39,373 --> 01:49:41,410
And the holy oath is taken.

1749
01:49:41,509 --> 01:49:43,420
..so that the testifier does not lie.

1750
01:49:43,477 --> 01:49:46,617
And the truth is revealed.
- Correct.

1751
01:49:46,680 --> 01:49:49,320
So if the same man
gives two statements.

1752
01:49:49,383 --> 01:49:51,556
..one under oath,
and the other one without.

1753
01:49:51,652 --> 01:49:54,064
..vvhich statement
will be considered true?

1754
01:49:54,121 --> 01:49:55,293
Obviously, the one given under oath.

1755
01:49:56,323 --> 01:49:57,358
The oath.

1756
01:49:57,558 --> 01:50:00,198
I am taking note, please continue.

1757
01:50:00,461 --> 01:50:01,735
Sorry, your honor.

1758
01:50:02,029 --> 01:50:05,533
What is your point, 
\/Ir. Reddy?
- Point?

1759
01:50:05,733 --> 01:50:09,078
My point is..that during
the sting operation.

1760
01:50:09,303 --> 01:50:14,776
..the people who were comfortably
sitting on their sofas and chatting.

1761
01:50:15,142 --> 01:50:19,557
..vvent quiet in front of
the Chandrachur Committee.

1762
01:50:20,014 --> 01:50:23,223
Why? What could be the reason,
Ms. Ivleera?

1763
01:50:23,384 --> 01:50:25,364
It's your point,
why don't you clear it?

1764
01:50:25,553 --> 01:50:27,226
The reason is clear, your honor.

1765
01:50:27,388 --> 01:50:31,632
When these people had to say
the same things under oath.

1766
01:50:32,026 --> 01:50:35,633
“meaning, they had to tell
the truth, they clearly refused.

1767
01:50:36,029 --> 01:50:37,269
No one stepped forward.

1768
01:50:37,364 --> 01:50:41,779
They didn't take the oath,
no one told the truth.

1769
01:50:42,703 --> 01:50:49,484
So, these sting tapes, which are
the foundation of this entire case.

1770
01:50:49,577 --> 01:50:51,648
..how can we believe them to be true?

1771
01:50:52,713 --> 01:50:56,251
Everyone..everyone
was talking in the air.

1772
01:50:57,451 --> 01:50:59,453
Everyone does it.. Gossip.

1773
01:50:59,820 --> 01:51:03,199
And they took everyone's
name, e><cept for their ovvn.

1774
01:51:03,490 --> 01:51:06,130
Ravi..Jay..Kapil..

1775
01:51:06,193 --> 01:51:08,571
So, if we believe
these tapes are rea
..

1776
01:51:08,763 --> 01:51:10,538
..then we should ban everyone.

1777
01:51:11,098 --> 01:51:12,702
In fact, we should ban
the entire Indian Cricket team.

1778
01:51:19,507 --> 01:51:21,043
You're quiet.

1779
01:51:23,010 --> 01:51:24,648
That means you agree.

1780
01:51:26,146 --> 01:51:27,489
Can I go now?

1781
01:51:28,282 --> 01:51:30,262
Ms. Ivleera,
I know you're not used to..

1782
01:51:30,317 --> 01:51:32,695
..standing on the other
side of the witness bo><.

1783
01:51:32,720 --> 01:51:35,701
But please clear one point for me.

1784
01:51:36,090 --> 01:51:37,160
Your honor, please take note..

1785
01:51:37,224 --> 01:51:41,104

\/Ir. Reddy, I am not sitting
here to just say ‘order-order‘.

1786
01:51:41,195 --> 01:51:42,606
I am taking note.

1787
01:51:42,663 --> 01:51:45,803
Please don't keep reminding me.
- Yes.

1788
01:51:47,601 --> 01:51:51,640
Who imposed this ban on my client?

1789
01:51:51,739 --> 01:51:52,774
The Cricket Association.

1790
01:51:53,240 --> 01:51:54,116
The Cricket Association.

1791
01:51:54,208 --> 01:51:56,586
And who carried out the investigation?

1792
01:51:56,677 --> 01:51:59,248

\/Ir. Ivladhavan the Cricket
Association's head.

1793
01:51:59,813 --> 01:52:01,986
The Cricket Association's head.

1794
01:52:02,483 --> 01:52:07,489
And who paid the salary to 
\/Ir.

\/Iadhavan's panel?

1795
01:52:11,592 --> 01:52:12,593
The Cricket Association.

1796
01:52:12,659 --> 01:52:15,196
The Cricket Association!
That's my point.

1797
01:52:15,562 --> 01:52:17,735
The Association imposed the ban!

1798
01:52:18,399 --> 01:52:20,401
The Association decided the panel!

1799
01:52:20,534 --> 01:52:23,242
The Association paid
this panel's salary!

1800
01:52:23,504 --> 01:52:26,542
So hovv can this panel
do their job neutrally?

1801
01:52:26,774 --> 01:52:31,348
Tomorrow,
if the government fires you..

1802
01:52:31,411 --> 01:52:34,551
..pays me,
and asks for my advice.

1803
01:52:34,715 --> 01:52:36,695
Then who will I favor?

1804
01:52:37,184 --> 01:52:39,095
The government. - Exactly.

1805
01:52:40,221 --> 01:52:45,569
We believe that the
Association violated rule no.8..

1806
01:52:45,626 --> 01:52:47,606
..by appointing 
\/Ir. Ivladhavan.

1807
01:52:47,661 --> 01:52:49,800
The association's initial
inquiry is faulty.

1808
01:52:50,163 --> 01:52:52,541
This ban is a conspiracy.
Completely illegal!

1809
01:52:54,268 --> 01:53:00,048
Your honor, we request the
court to take note of these points..

1810
01:53:01,208 --> 01:53:04,382
I mean..consider these points.

1811
01:53:05,212 --> 01:53:08,056
..and give justice to India's
most successful captain.

1812
01:53:09,583 --> 01:53:14,054
He dedicated his entire
life to cricket and this country.

1813
01:53:16,690 --> 01:53:18,101
Thank you, Ms. Ivleera. I am done.

1814
01:53:19,726 --> 01:53:20,636
Thank you, your honor.

1815
01:53:20,694 --> 01:53:23,140
Ms. Ivleera, you may take your seat.

1816
01:53:23,364 --> 01:53:24,570
Thank you, your honor.

1817
01:53:39,180 --> 01:53:43,754
"To win again."

1818
01:53:46,486 --> 01:53:53,802
"To win again."

1819
01:53:54,028 --> 01:53:58,670
"To win again."

1820
01:54:03,537 --> 01:54:04,709
Order. Order.

1821
01:54:07,574 --> 01:54:09,747
The court is adjourned for lunch.

1822
01:54:10,678 --> 01:54:12,988
The judgment will
be announced at 3pm.

1823
01:54:17,451 --> 01:54:18,691
Azhar, come fast.

1824
01:54:19,987 --> 01:54:23,161
Azhar, come see what
they are saying about you on the news.

1825
01:54:23,623 --> 01:54:24,294
Come on.

1826
01:54:24,391 --> 01:54:27,065
Before going on a break we said..

1827
01:54:27,361 --> 01:54:30,570
..we'

 tell you what
Kapil thinks about Azhar.

1828
01:54:30,697 --> 01:54:33,007
Because during this
sensational moment.

1829
01:54:33,033 --> 01:54:34,205
..the country trusts only Aaj Tak.

1830
01:54:34,434 --> 01:54:37,005
So we've invited Kapil on Aaj Tak.

1831
01:54:37,037 --> 01:54:38,539
Yes, 
\/Ir. Kapil.

1832
01:54:38,638 --> 01:54:41,312
Hovv true are the accusations
he's been charged with?

1833
01:54:42,643 --> 01:54:44,384
100 percent.

1834
01:54:47,047 --> 01:54:54,022
You can't be 100 percent
sure of what you see..

1835
01:54:54,054 --> 01:54:56,694
..and these are just rumors.

1836
01:54:57,357 --> 01:55:04,502
In my view..Azhar was a good player,
a very good captain.

1837
01:55:05,699 --> 01:55:10,978
..and as far as I
think..he should be innocent.

1838
01:55:12,305 --> 01:55:15,184
You stayed quiet for so many years,
so why support him now?

1839
01:55:16,677 --> 01:55:20,215
I would like to say..vve
all made mistakes.

1840
01:55:20,280 --> 01:55:23,420
We didn't support our teammate.

1841
01:55:24,518 --> 01:55:28,330
We didn't support him
when he needed us the most.

1842
01:55:28,689 --> 01:55:31,329
And he kept fighting alone.

1843
01:55:31,558 --> 01:55:35,370
But..Azhar is a fighter.

1844
01:55:36,997 --> 01:55:40,376
As far as I know him,
he'll never give up.

1845
01:55:43,570 --> 01:55:45,777
We are live at the finals
of the Jubilee Cup.

1846
01:55:46,039 --> 01:55:47,780
..between India and Sri Lanka.

1847
01:55:51,778 --> 01:55:54,691
India wins the toss and puts
Sri Lanka into bat.

1848
01:55:58,585 --> 01:56:00,496
Sanath and Romesh are in form batsmen.

1849
01:56:00,553 --> 01:56:02,555
Let's see hovv the Indian bowlers fair.

1850
01:56:02,956 --> 01:56:04,196
And a beautiful leg drive..

1851
01:56:04,258 --> 01:56:05,737
..that's a misfield,

1852
01:56:09,430 --> 01:56:10,738
He's grabbed on to so much cash.

1853
01:56:10,998 --> 01:56:12,375
..that there's no room
to grab the ball anymore.

1854
01:56:12,632 --> 01:56:13,508
This match is ours.

1855
01:56:14,034 --> 01:56:18,176
That is strange, very rarely
we see Azhar leave a ball.

1856
01:56:27,614 --> 01:56:30,026
Ani
's bowling
brilliantly from one end.

1857
01:56:30,050 --> 01:56:32,360
He's asking Azhar for the ne><t over.

1858
01:56:33,486 --> 01:56:36,763
But what's this, Azhar has tossed
the ball to Ajay for the ne><t over.

1859
01:56:38,625 --> 01:56:41,469
Ajay's ready to bowl his first over.

1860
01:56:41,495 --> 01:56:44,203
I thought jumbo's coming up ne><t,
but it's the joker instead.

1861
01:56:44,698 --> 01:56:47,611
Ajay must take care
of the line and length.

1862
01:56:47,667 --> 01:56:48,645
What's wrong with Azhar?

1863
01:56:50,237 --> 01:56:52,444
Azhar has taken a
very strange decision.

1864
01:56:52,539 --> 01:56:54,610
India will either get a wicket.

1865
01:56:54,675 --> 01:56:56,086
..or this match will slip away.

1866
01:56:56,109 --> 01:56:57,281
What do you have to say about it, Bob?

1867
01:56:57,344 --> 01:56:59,085
It's exactly what I thought.

1868
01:56:59,112 --> 01:57:02,355
The first ball itself Sanath has
hit over the covers for a boundary.

1869
01:57:02,549 --> 01:57:04,256
2.5 million..lndia will lose.

1870
01:57:06,253 --> 01:57:08,529
A great shot. Four runs!

1871
01:57:11,692 --> 01:57:15,071
Listen..make that
5 mi

ion..on India's loss.

1872
01:57:19,032 --> 01:57:23,139
Oh my God, that's a biggie
all the way to the stands.

1873
01:57:24,337 --> 01:57:28,308
The Sri Lankan crowds are thoroughly
enjoying this batting spectacle.

1874
01:57:30,043 --> 01:57:33,183
Anil bovvling..and that's a wicket!

1875
01:57:33,346 --> 01:57:37,055
The Indian crowd is finally starting
to enjoy the game.

1876
01:57:37,184 --> 01:57:39,027
Finally this partnership's
come to an end..

1877
01:57:39,086 --> 01:57:41,589
..and Romesh is heading
back to dressing room.

1878
01:57:41,655 --> 01:57:44,636
But danger man Sanath
is still at the crease.

1879
01:57:44,725 --> 01:57:47,171
Captaincy is not
everyone's cup of tea.

1880
01:57:47,327 --> 01:57:50,274
It's like handing over the
prey to the lion. Go on, have a blast.

1881
01:57:51,264 --> 01:57:55,178
Ajay back in the bowling attack,
and the result is the same.

1882
01:57:55,202 --> 01:57:58,046
And the ball is just
flying all over the park.

1883
01:57:58,205 --> 01:58:03,245
That's a massive inside-out shot for
si><. All the way in to the stands.

1884
01:58:07,614 --> 01:58:10,060
Sanath has hit it high in the air.

1885
01:58:10,584 --> 01:58:13,463
And he's got,
a tough catch taken by Sachin.

1886
01:58:17,691 --> 01:58:18,533
He did good.

1887
01:58:19,126 --> 01:58:21,367
‘The game will get
over in 4O overs..'

1888
01:58:22,329 --> 01:58:23,433
Land the profit will be double.‘

1889
01:58:24,130 --> 01:58:27,407
The Sri Lankans have put a good total
for this pitch.

1890
01:58:27,567 --> 01:58:31,105
India need 280 in 5O overs
to win the Jubilee Cup.

1891
01:58:31,471 --> 01:58:35,510
India's opening pair, Sachin
and Sourav walking down the field.

1892
01:58:40,514 --> 01:58:42,323
So what's the price on India's loss?

1893
01:58:42,449 --> 01:58:45,362
Leave the calculations to us.

1894
01:58:45,686 --> 01:58:47,097
Just get this straight.

1895
01:58:47,153 --> 01:58:49,531
..from this day onwards you
won't have to play another match.

1896
01:58:53,260 --> 01:58:56,537
Chaminda will bowl on behalf
of the Sri Lankan team.

1897
01:58:58,264 --> 01:59:01,074
And Sachin's played
a beautiful straight drive.

1898
01:59:01,301 --> 01:59:02,575
Excellent shot.

1899
01:59:02,669 --> 01:59:06,048
Sachin's already unsettled Chaminda.

1900
01:59:11,244 --> 01:59:12,314
And that's out.

1901
01:59:12,579 --> 01:59:15,185
Sachin's wicket down, and
the Indian fans are disappointed.

1902
01:59:22,222 --> 01:59:24,725
We were afraid of the little guy.

1903
01:59:25,058 --> 01:59:26,469
But you convinced him too.

1904
01:59:26,660 --> 01:59:27,968
You're amazing.

1905
01:59:30,397 --> 01:59:31,535
He got out himself.

1906
01:59:32,232 --> 01:59:33,575
It happens in cricket.

1907
01:59:39,372 --> 01:59:41,545
There goes Dada after the little guy.

1908
01:59:41,975 --> 01:59:43,750
You turned out to be an ace-player.

1909
01:59:45,512 --> 01:59:46,718
It's a big loss for India.

1910
01:59:46,980 --> 01:59:48,755
They have just lost Sourav's wicket.

1911
01:59:49,149 --> 01:59:53,188
The crowd is getting restless, and
there's still no sign of Azhar.

1912
01:59:54,454 --> 01:59:55,330
Azhar.

1913
02:00:01,161 --> 02:00:01,764
Azhar.

1914
02:00:02,095 --> 02:00:03,438
The judge called you twice.

1915
02:00:03,596 --> 02:00:04,540
Come quickly.

1916
02:00:08,135 --> 02:00:11,082
This case wasn't easy.

1917
02:00:11,337 --> 02:00:14,079
The public outrage
and the media pressure.

1918
02:00:14,141 --> 02:00:15,620
The truth was right in front of us.

1919
02:00:15,675 --> 02:00:18,656
..but it takes time to get to it.

1920
02:00:19,579 --> 02:00:26,155
Azhar! Azhar! Azhar! Azhar! Azhar!

1921
02:00:26,553 --> 02:00:27,258
Here comes our player.

1922
02:00:27,287 --> 02:00:30,234
Azhar will have to
play a captain's inning.

1923
02:00:30,323 --> 02:00:31,495
What do you have to say, Tony?

1924
02:00:31,558 --> 02:00:34,437
You're right, Azhar will have
to play a captain's knock today.

1925
02:00:34,494 --> 02:00:36,440
..or else India won't make it.

1926
02:00:36,630 --> 02:00:40,772
They have always relied on Sachin
and Azhar so today, that leaves Azhar.

1927
02:00:41,435 --> 02:00:45,076
Azhar! Azhar! Azhar! Azhar! Azhar!

1928
02:00:45,138 --> 02:00:49,450
Azhar! Azhar! Azhar! Azhar! Azhar!

1929
02:00:49,742 --> 02:00:57,251
Azhar! Azhar! Azhar! Azhar! Azhar!

1930
02:00:57,450 --> 02:01:03,401
Azhar! Azhar! Azhar! Azhar! Azhar!

1931
02:01:18,338 --> 02:01:20,409
‘And once you're in the middle
of the ground, you must decide..'

1932
02:01:20,540 --> 02:01:21,518
'..when you win the match.

1933
02:01:21,575 --> 02:01:24,351
..you let those 1 billion
Indians sleep in peace.‘

1934
02:01:24,678 --> 02:01:26,419
'..or lose the match,
and make them weep in their pillows.‘

1935
02:01:27,581 --> 02:01:29,561
‘This bat will become your voice,
get that?‘

1936
02:01:29,649 --> 02:01:30,753
‘Come on..p
ay.'

1937
02:01:45,765 --> 02:01:50,737
Azhar! Azhar! Azhar!

1938
02:01:52,339 --> 02:01:55,809
Azhar! Azhar! Azhar!

1939
02:02:06,619 --> 02:02:08,565
What a swift square cut for four.

1940
02:02:16,129 --> 02:02:18,302
Ms. Ivleera Verma.
- Yes, your honor.

1941
02:02:18,365 --> 02:02:20,743
The way you fought this case.

1942
02:02:21,068 --> 02:02:23,548
..is just like Azhar
used to bat back in the day.

1943
02:02:23,770 --> 02:02:25,010
On the front foot.

1944
02:02:26,540 --> 02:02:31,580
And Azhar's gone berserk.
He's only dealing in fours and si><es.

1945
02:02:32,145 --> 02:02:33,590
He's going to play some shots.

1946
02:02:33,780 --> 02:02:37,193
If they lose easily,
people will get suspicious.

1947
02:02:39,653 --> 02:02:43,260
And that's what the doctors
ordered for the Indians.

1948
02:02:44,024 --> 02:02:46,026
And it's
working well for Azhar.

1949
02:02:46,326 --> 02:02:47,498
I am watching the match as well.

1950
02:02:47,561 --> 02:02:49,336
Hang up! Hang UP!

1951
02:02:51,331 --> 02:02:55,279
The court knows that
today's judgment.

1952
02:02:55,335 --> 02:02:59,579
..wi

 affect the entire Indian team,
and not just Azhar alone.

1953
02:03:00,106 --> 02:03:03,747
India needs 4 runs in
3 balls for win this match.

1954
02:03:04,544 --> 02:03:08,424
If India wins today/then
you are a dead man.

1955
02:03:09,249 --> 02:03:14,358
Azhar! Azhar! Azhar!

1956
02:03:15,388 --> 02:03:16,332
Azhar..

1957
02:03:18,391 --> 02:03:20,564
Many people were at fault.

1958
02:03:22,062 --> 02:03:27,410
CBPs fau
t..no charge-sheet
was prepared against the bookies.

1959
02:03:27,534 --> 02:03:30,447
We didn't receive any voice
memos of Hansie's statement.

1960
02:03:30,670 --> 02:03:32,411
But only one person was blamed.

1961
02:03:32,672 --> 02:03:39,089
Azhar! Azhar! Azhar!

1962
02:03:55,328 --> 02:03:58,798
And lnclia has won a brilliant
finals against Sri Lanka.

1963
02:03:59,065 --> 02:04:01,636
What a brilliant captain's innings
for lnclia to lift the Jubilee Cup.

1964
02:04:02,068 --> 02:04:07,347
The court dismisses the life ban
imposed on Azhar by the Association.

1965
02:04:07,607 --> 02:04:10,679
..and gives order
to revoke it immediately.

1966
02:04:11,344 --> 02:04:16,521
This case is unsustainable against
Azhar due to sheer lack of evidence.

1967
02:04:17,050 --> 02:04:20,623
The court lifts the cricket
association's ban on Azhar.

1968
02:04:21,154 --> 02:04:23,191
This case is closed.

1969
02:04:59,625 --> 02:05:03,971
Azhar! Azhar!

1970
02:05:04,064 --> 02:05:08,012
Azhar! Azhar!

1971
02:05:08,167 --> 02:05:13,241
Azhar! Azhar!

1972
02:05:28,755 --> 02:05:31,292
Madam. This letter is for you.

1973
02:05:46,272 --> 02:05:48,183
Sir.. Sir..

1974
02:05:48,341 --> 02:05:49,684
Calm down. Calm down.

1975
02:05:50,376 --> 02:05:52,378
Let Azhar speak..let him speak.

1976
02:05:52,512 --> 02:05:53,786
Please. Please.

1977
02:05:54,047 --> 02:05:57,392
My grandpa had said that
I will play 100 test matches.

1978
02:05:57,550 --> 02:05:59,552
But sir, you only played 99.

1979
02:06:01,021 --> 02:06:04,332
This court case was nothing
less than a test-match.

1980
02:06:06,225 --> 02:06:10,173
This was the biggest
test match of my life.

1981
02:06:10,730 --> 02:06:12,300
It's not my fault.

1982
02:06:12,365 --> 02:06:15,073
He took money.
He even shook hands.

1983
02:06:15,168 --> 02:06:17,512
And clearly said he'll
play according to us.

1984
02:06:18,038 --> 02:06:20,040
He went back on his words..

1985
02:06:26,513 --> 02:06:30,188
Azhar, you made
the biggest mistake of your life.

1986
02:06:30,550 --> 02:06:34,054
This game is my life,
I won't let anyone play with it.

1987
02:06:34,153 --> 02:06:35,461
You took money..

1988
02:06:35,655 --> 02:06:37,601
That was my game.

1989
02:06:38,191 --> 02:06:40,193
So that you don't
approach anyone else.

1990
02:06:40,493 --> 02:06:42,302
You bet on India's loss.

1991
02:06:42,528 --> 02:06:44,201
But you're the one who actually lost.

1992
02:06:44,497 --> 02:06:46,374
You clearly went back on your word..

1993
02:06:46,566 --> 02:06:51,208
..but if you open your mouth, then
we won't spare anyone in your family.

1994
02:06:51,371 --> 02:06:52,509
Don't worry about me.

1995
02:06:53,373 --> 02:06:55,512
Allah will look after His Mohammad.

1996
02:06:56,042 --> 02:06:57,544
I've returned your money.

1997
02:07:04,384 --> 02:07:08,298
‘Sometimes I think about that day.‘
‘What if I had got out?‘

1998
02:07:19,966 --> 02:07:22,412
‘This is the story
of my entire innings.‘

1999
02:07:24,137 --> 02:07:29,644
‘Whether anyone believes it or not,
I'll let you, the people decide.‘

2000
02:07:30,977 --> 02:07:34,186
‘I fought this case.
because I know.‘

2001
02:07:35,315 --> 02:07:37,317
‘Records are made
when you score 100..'

2002
02:07:37,984 --> 02:07:39,622
'..no one cheers
when you get out on 99.‘

2003
02:07:53,466 --> 02:08:00,406
"To win again."

2004
02:08:00,573 --> 02:08:07,957
"To win again."

2005
02:08:08,114 --> 02:08:12,221
"To win again."

2006
02:08:28,434 --> 02:08:35,648
"
 know that I am broken,
but not shattered."

2007
02:08:35,675 --> 02:08:42,456
"
 am not a peice of ice
that melts away in the heat."

2008
02:08:42,515 --> 02:08:49,729
"My heart won't be
scared of these storms."

2009
02:08:49,989 --> 02:08:56,133
"My heart will fight
against both the worlds."

2010
02:08:56,229 --> 02:08:59,699
"To win again."

2011
02:09:03,436 --> 02:09:08,715
"To win again."

2012
02:09:10,710 --> 02:09:14,453
"To win again."

2013
02:09:53,419 --> 02:10:00,701
"The darkness fades away,
and the dawn's finally here."

2014
02:10:00,726 --> 02:10:07,473
"
 can see the light
from the cracks in the darkness."

2015
02:10:07,533 --> 02:10:14,781
"My heart won't be
scared of these storms."

2016
02:10:15,041 --> 02:10:21,219
"My heart will fight
against both the worlds."

2017
02:10:21,347 --> 02:10:25,625
"To win again."

2018
02:10:28,521 --> 02:10:32,196
"To win again."

2019
02:10:35,795 --> 02:10:40,335
"To win again."

2020
02:10:50,676 --> 02:10:58,151
"The darkness fades away,
and the dawn's finally here."

2021
02:10:58,251 --> 02:11:04,759
"
 can see the light
from the cracks in the darkness."

2022
02:11:04,991 --> 02:11:12,273
"My heart won't be
scared of these storms."

2023
02:11:12,332 --> 02:11:18,408
"My heart will fight
against both the worlds."

2024
02:11:18,471 --> 02:11:23,420
"To win again."
