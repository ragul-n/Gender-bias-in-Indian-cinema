1
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:53,114
India is great!

2
00:01:55,782 --> 00:02:00,629
People belonging to different religions
are living together peacefully here.

3
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,289
That's why, India is great!

4
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,467
Enemy states, terrorists, mafia
tried in many ways to break our unity,

5
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,131
they're still trying,

6
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:14,801
one such attempt is 1993 Mumbai blasts,

7
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:19,314
1998 Coimbatore bomb blasts,
2002 Akshardam attacks,

8
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:22,146
2007, 2013 Hyderabad blasts,

9
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:25,812
they tried to break us apart
with many such heinous acts,

10
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,653
but they couldn't even
pluck a hair strand,

11
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,726
that's the spirit of India,

12
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,838
After Mumbai blasts,
many gangsters ran away from India,

13
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,169
one among them is Sadhu Thai,

14
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,335
after conquering Singapore,
Hong Kong, Malaysia, Philippines,

15
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:51,175
he became Godfather to
South East Asian mafia,

16
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,510
joining forces with terrorist outfits,

17
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,176
creating chaos with death
and bomb blasts,

18
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:59,186
Sadhu Thai who had become
a big problem to Indian Government,

19
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,848
no one could dare stop him
for 20 years,

20
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:07,192
the first man to challenge Sadhu Thai
is Badshah!-A place in Hong Kong...

21
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:16,201
Anyone who enters mafia for livelihood
or to terrorise others,

22
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:16,863
but Badshah has entered
mafia world for his father,

23
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:28,546
Badshah, you've shaken the
world of mafia.

24
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,378
But committed many mistakes.

25
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,218
You've dared to taken on
Sadhu Thai, Godfather of mafia,

26
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,884
you killed my brother,

27
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,726
I'm mad about films,
I watch two films every day,

28
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,061
Every time I watched I used
to get a doubt,

29
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:48,570
if a man's caught instead of killing him,
why do they lecture to him?

30
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,564
Now I'm clear.

31
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,574
I've experienced the kick in it.
I got it.

32
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,245
I'm not killing you immediately.

33
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,247
I've to give you more pain.
How?

34
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,578
Father!

35
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,915
I'll kill your father
right before your eyes.

36
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,483
Get Baadshah's father!

37
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,972
If tiger is inside the cell,
even kids can play with it.

38
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,142
When it comes out into the arena,
it begins to hunt!

39
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,878
Impossible to stop it.

40
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,819
Not just the police of Hong Kong,
Indian police is also searching for you.

41
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,820
Take good care of my father,

42
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,819
there's a solution to every problem,

43
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,723
I'll find that solution
wherever it may be.

44
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:09,661
Few days later...
Milan, Italy...

45
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,515
One who wants his security
rears a dog,

46
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:31,018
one who wants society to
be secure grows trees!

47
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:40,858
Now I've earned the right
to have breakfast.

48
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,357
Come for breakfast.
- You know what to tell her, right?

49
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,198
Today morning I cleaned
the toilet, sister.

50
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,034
I did the dusting, sister.
- I know you both didn't do anything.

51
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:50,867
Have breakfast first.

52
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,534
You bore us saying got to do some good
to earn the right to have breakfast,

53
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,202
how come you're offering breakfast
without any lecture, sister?

54
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,713
Nothing, I've finished
my interior designing course here,

55
00:08:58,871 --> 00:08:59,872
I'm going back to India,

56
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:03,885
so I want these last 10 days
memorable and enjoy it to the hilt.

57
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:07,718
Where are you taking us, sister?
- There's no kick if I tell you.

58
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,398
This is too much, sister.
We're here since our childhood,

59
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,559
even neighbours don't know our names,

60
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,399
but you've become a celebrity
in just a year.

61
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:29,241
Like Sonia left Italy to settle in India,
sister will leave India to settle here.

62
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:34,412
Are you confused about
so many greeting her?

63
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,747
It's hello in Italian language.

64
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:40,083
To know about her followers,
you need to follow her for some time.

65
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,248
Why did you bring us to hospital
promising to enjoy, sister?

66
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,450
Why are you getting anxious?

67
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,762
Did you offer us breakfast
to donate blood?

68
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:49,592
We'll not donate.

69
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,759
Selfishness is like slush!
Get into it gives you scabies!

70
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,428
Help is like ball,
playing with it gives you happiness.

71
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,767
We don't want any happiness.

72
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,114
Why did you call me here urgently?
Everyone is fine, right?

73
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,618
We're fine, you'll lose blood now.
- Blood donation again?

74
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,780
You know how difficult it is
to co-ordinate for film shoots.

75
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,118
Balaiah is on location!

76
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,124
Uncle, your earn money
coordinating film shoots,

77
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,785
blood donation would add
good deeds to your life.

78
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:22,125
That's if we do once in 6 months,
every month would give me weakness.

79
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,460
They'll give you apple to eat.

80
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,966
You don't worry, uncle.
We'll stay here only.

81
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,474
They took a liter blood
and gave this apple.

82
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,637
They sucked B positive only.

83
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,646
Uncle, good deed is like
a ball hit on the wall,

84
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,148
you do good,
you get good in return.

85
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,479
Trusting your ball,

86
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,987
last month, I accepted credit
for a producer,

87
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,818
he's not answering my phone calls,

88
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,824
now a day's goodness isn't
a ball hit on the wall,

89
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,485
it's whitewash of the wall,

90
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,495
if you scratch,
it'll hurt your nails!

91
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,823
Uncle is hurt!

92
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,497
Is it?
Thank you!

93
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,502
What happened, uncle?

94
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,163
It seems that producer has
paid the money.

95
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,003
What do you say now?
- Your ball has won.

96
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,508
Learn from your father.

97
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,669
You shared his blood but
not his goodness.

98
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:13,339
Their blood group is different, right?
They don't have a big heart like me.- Uncle!

99
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,507
It's danger to us
what ever we may say!

100
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,675
She'll remember something.

101
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,843
Heart makes me remember
today is World Heart Day!

102
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,353
I must immediately go to
child heart care.

103
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,686
Sorry dear, stingy God gave me
only one heart.

104
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,559
Uncle?

105
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,862
We can't do it anymore, sister.

106
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,872
We're doing bachelor's degree and
begging like beggars, what's this?

107
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:42,205
If you help someone and
look into their eyes...

108
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,370
They'll suspect you're ogling at them!

109
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:48,212
I can't reform you!
Count the collection.

110
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,547
Is it donation box of Tirupathi
to count leisurely?

111
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,714
It could be just 5 Euros.
Let's go.

112
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,384
My target is 10000 Euros,
I won't move till I achieve it.

113
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,893
10000 Euros?

114
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,223
We've to rob a bank.

115
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,889
No need, people with social conscience...

116
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,057
What's that?
Social conscience...?

117
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:08,068
We need dictionary to
understand your language.

118
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:11,071
Michael Jackson must come here
to achieve your target.

119
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:59,348
I don't remember it was June or July,
I fell in love with her...

120
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:06,962
I'm a Romeo, a lonely lover,
my love isn't with me now...

121
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:13,960
I'm spread an unlimited love
within my limited heart...

122
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,800
You're my heart,
soul and life...

123
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:22,143
I'm frantically searching for you Saira,
you're my only happiness in life...

124
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:23,033
Heat waves in winter is
because of you...

125
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:27,041
What am I without you?

126
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,545
I've to rivers of fire
to reach you...

127
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:35,208
I've a brave heart,
why is it so mellowed?

128
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:39,819
I'll come wherever you are
in which ever direction...

129
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:19,323
Hello!- Why are you behaving like
a fool, Saira?

130
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,981
Do you know I'm dancing on
streets like a mad man for you?

131
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,991
But still you didn't turn up,
why are you playing ball with my life?

132
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:40,170
You did everything for that girl,
when she came to thank you,

133
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,174
why did you avoid her?

134
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,335
Relationship would get cut
here with thanks,

135
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,506
now that I avoided her,
she would think about me tonight!

136
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,183
He helped and vanished!

137
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,344
Please ensure I see him again...
- I'll never be seen again!

138
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,354
You too wish that, right Saira?

139
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,015
You'd be happy without me, right?

140
00:16:56,181 --> 00:17:00,186
That's why, not just from your life,
I'm leaving this world for good.

141
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,592
Hey boy, you!

142
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,201
I'm coming, stay there!

143
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,203
Don't move, you may die!

144
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,363
Why do you want to die so young?
- Don't come, do you also want to die?

145
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,374
Come...come I say!

146
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,204
Why are you stopping me?

147
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,711
You helped a lot without your
knowledge to raise funds for charity.

148
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,042
Then, help me by pushing me down.

149
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,707
What's that nonsense?
Spend a day with me.

150
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,717
I'm not that type.

151
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,378
I'm not that cheap.
- Costly?

152
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,047
I'm not that type at all!

153
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,214
But you asked me to spend
a day with you, right?

154
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:32,726
Spend a day with me I'll give
hundred reasons to live,

155
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,228
and prove that
life is beautiful.

156
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,565
Please listen to me once.

157
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:43,737
Your frustration to stop me is more
dangerous than my frustration to die.

158
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,239
Thanks, you got it.

159
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,899
Generally, a dying person asks
for last wish,

160
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,409
but you're asking for a dying man.

161
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,069
So I'm giving you a day!

162
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:51,912
What's that?

163
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:55,575
If I don't get any hope on life,
you must drop me here tomorrow.

164
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,085
Because I don't have money
for taxi also.

165
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,757
On hearing this name Peter Ganesh,
it has a long flashback story.

166
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,425
Do we need patience to hear it?

167
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,767
You stopped me from dying and
why trouble me with Peter Ganesh?

168
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,102
Don't get frustrated Rama Rao,
I'm coming to the point.

169
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,266
Peter too tried to
commit suicide like you.

170
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,270
I could save him
because I was there.

171
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:28,111
I took him to home and asked,
what's your problem, Peter?

172
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,115
He told me.

173
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,618
He went bankrupt doing
different kinds of business.

174
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,279
May have prospered doing one business.

175
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:37,791
His partners cheated him.
- You mean like my Saira Banu.

176
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:42,622
I told him you've courage to die,
why not try living with it?

177
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,131
He fell into line with
just one sitting.

178
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,132
I observed that food is
very tasty in his home,

179
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,134
I suggested opening a restaurant
and presented him idol of Lord Ganesh.

180
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:51,137
Actually I gave him faith not an idol.

181
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:55,134
Business succeeded with faith
and his problem weakened.

182
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,643
He realised that.
What did you understand from this?

183
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:03,981
Never throw away ball got as alms,
don't ruin life for difficulties.

184
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:08,481
Like mending ball to make it work,
patch up life and carry on.

185
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:13,323
Mine isn't financial problem like
Peter to make it work with patches.

186
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,156
I got it.

187
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,321
Everyone won't get convinced
with one sitting like Peter.

188
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,161
You need more sittings.

189
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,667
What should I learn from this statue?
- Patience!

190
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,504
James was a notorious pick-pocket.

191
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:29,668
What was the talent you observed in him?

192
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:34,181
He can wait for hours like ajackal
to pick someone's pocket.

193
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:37,513
I got it, you wanted him to
cash it like this.

194
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:42,686
James used to pick pockets earlier but
people are giving money voluntarily now.

195
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,350
Hi sister!
- Got him?

196
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:47,690
Got him? Had I not reached on time,
he would've gone forever.

197
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,697
His name is Rama Rao.
- Is their father donkey?

198
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,864
Don't feel bad, he's frustrated,
his lover cheated him.

199
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,528
He appears like a cheat.

200
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,698
See, any man who got cheated by
a woman is cheap to everyone.

201
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,707
I came to a foreign country
for Saira Banu,

202
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:01,867
not a penny in my pocket,

203
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,707
whenever I think about her cheating,

204
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,212
I wish someone hugs me tightly,

205
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,544
and say Rama Rao, don't worry
I'm there for you,

206
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,210
but who is here for me?
None! Leave me, I'll go away.

207
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,219
Rama Rao, stop!
- Leave me, I'll die.

208
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,881
Don't worry, I'm there for you.

209
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,225
He made her hug him.

210
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,795
Why is Saira Banu playing
football with my life?

211
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,555
Football brings to my memory,

212
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,560
life is like a football game,

213
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,234
would we stop playing game
if we miss the ball?

214
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:28,564
We buy a new ball.

215
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,735
If you miss Saira Banu,
you may get Udaya Banu.

216
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,400
What's your problem anyway?

217
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,068
It's just the size of cricket ball.

218
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,739
I must tell you about a warrior who
fought with basket ball sized problems.

219
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,249
Who dumped him?
- God dumped him!

220
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,415
He lost his mother at 3,
lost his father at 13.

221
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,419
Next wicket at 23?

222
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:50,082
Not so long gap, he lost aunt and
uncle who raised him the next year.

223
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,093
Oh my God! Is he still alive
after killing so many people?

224
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,492
Who is this man eater?

225
00:20:56,755 --> 00:21:00,100
I went to the tip of mountain
to throw away beer bottle,

226
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,604
that silly girl thought I was committing
suicide and took me to her home.

227
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:09,109
I don't mind losing my job!
But life is very happy!

228
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,442
You'll not get this life second time!

229
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,110
I'll call you later.

230
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,297
With your inspiration,

231
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,807
wish to die has turned
into hope to live, madam.

232
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:44,140
I've developed the attitude
of helping others like you.

233
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:45,812
What have you done for that?

234
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,315
I went to a church and donated
pasta to poor children, madam.

235
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,144
Donated pasta?

236
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,653
It is donating rice in India
and here it is donating pasta.

237
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,182
Next?
- I held next door aunty, madam.

238
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,158
I didn't mean that held,
I held her while she was falling down.

239
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,819
My foot!

240
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,488
She slipped walking on a banana peel
and I held her.

241
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,158
Started the second chapter in
your autobiography, madam,

242
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,999
just now started the world of ball,
it's coming out very nicely!

243
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,005
I don't like this!
Anyway as you wish.

244
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,007
What's this world of ball
like animal world?

245
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,339
Don't you know about madam's
ball philosophy?

246
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:17,343
Who is he, madam?

247
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,004
He's Rama Rao.
- Why is he here?

248
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,845
He wanted to kill himself.
His lover dumped him.

249
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,351
What happened?
- I remembered Saira Banu.

250
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:28,184
I'll go...leave me...
- Stop...stop...listen to me.

251
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,682
This is common.
- I feel like dying.

252
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:31,350
I wish to put my under
a running train.

253
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,860
What's that nonsense?
I'm there for you.

254
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,363
Leave him, let him die.
What bothers us?

255
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,029
If I had thought like that,
would you be here now?

256
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,861
He'll stay here tonight.
Be careful.

257
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,598
Would he do anything to me?
- See that he doesn't harm himself.

258
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,541
Tell the boy about my philosophy
and quotations,

259
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,701
and give him a hope in life.
Got it?

260
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,370
If I really tell him,
he'll die for sure.

261
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:52,879
Look Rama Rao,

262
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,882
we write with pencils in school,
do you know why?

263
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,385
If we write it wrong, we can rub
and write it correctly,

264
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,216
but when we grow up,
we get pens to write,

265
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,949
there's no chance of correcting it.

266
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:06,226
I'll incorporate this pencil
philosophy in your biography.

267
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,888
Dasu, you know I don't like
all this, right?

268
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,055
Anyway, as you wish.

269
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,961
Think over tonight what I said!
- About pencil, right?

270
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,064
Let's meet tomorrow morning.

271
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,570
What if I remember Saira Banu
in the mean time?

272
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,402
You take care of him, Dasu.
Bye.

273
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,408
Which place are you from?
Were you committing suicide?

274
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,412
Come on do it now, let me see!

275
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,414
Are you fooling her because
she too innocent?

276
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:29,745
I'll rip out your skin!

277
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,416
Where's the vodka?
- Vodka?

278
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:36,582
Smell! can you tell the brand with smell?

279
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,591
I can tell character by looking at eyes.

280
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,921
Is your family dead?
- Nobody is dead. Nothing!

281
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:45,591
You're here for livelihood
and I'm here for Janaki.

282
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,770
From now onwards...
- I'm at your service!

283
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,938
Look Rama Rao, one side there's death
and life is on the other side.

284
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,276
Decision is in your hands.

285
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,113
Quotation is marvelous!
I'll add it in your biography.

286
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:06,779
Shut up! You know I hate all this!
Anyway do as you wish!

287
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,782
Look, problem is like a ball,

288
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,451
if you look at it close to your eyes,
it'll appear big,

289
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,619
if you throw
it away, it appears very small.

290
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,959
We can throw a ball away but
how can I throw Saira Banu?

291
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,295
She's huge like a bullock!
- I got you.

292
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,631
What you've on Saira Banu
isn't love but hatred!

293
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,295
Once the hatred is out,
your problem is solved.

294
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,464
How can I remove hatred
like removing air from a ball?

295
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,803
There's a solution for that too.
Dasu, come here.

296
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,803
Think he's Saira Banu,
throw up whatever is in your heart.

297
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:33,313
He had a heavy breakfast,
are you asking him to throw up on me?

298
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,151
Close your eyes and take a deep breath!

299
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:43,324
Did you take? Remember all the atrocities
Saira Banu committed on you!

300
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:44,483
That is...that's it...

301
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,153
open up now!

302
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,161
Hey you, Saira Banu!

303
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,994
How you tortured me?

304
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,664
Will you use me like a servant
without considering me as yours?

305
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:02,668
If you change hostel every 6 months,
should I carry you baggage and luggage?

306
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,678
If your uncle has an eye operation,
should I bring him food?

307
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,340
Did you stick to me only
after doing so much?

308
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:12,683
How many boyfriends do you've
like radio brothers?

309
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,346
Will you fall for every man you meet?

310
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,186
Will you please give her phone number?

311
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,017
Give me your phone.

312
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:23,531
Aren't you ashamed to maintain friends
with cell phone I bought for you?

313
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:29,365
What's this, madam? It's wonderful!

314
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,530
Anger is off my system!
- My phone too is gone.

315
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,198
Let it go, bloody phone!

316
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,038
Rama Rao's anger has gone,
that's important.

317
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,544
I lost the thought of dying
in just one day,

318
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:40,706
if you give me 10 days,
I'll find a way to live.

319
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,874
Sister isn't free,
she's going back to India.

320
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:46,045
Rama Rao will stay with us
till I go back to India.- Sister?

321
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:49,715
You want a ball to play and
he wants a ball to live.

322
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:53,385
You're catching all the balls
perfectly like a wicket keeper.

323
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,400
How far your job has reached, Badshah?

324
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,233
I've met Janaki, I'll accomplish
the job in near future.

325
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,739
There's information that Sadhu Bhai's
men are in Italy for you.

326
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,574
Take care of dad.

327
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,913
Why did you react so violently?

328
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,923
My reaction would be violent
if anyone touches from behind?

329
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:39,435
Welcome to meet the star program!

330
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,942

00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,273
'Football with Skull'
'I'll Kill by Cutting Throat'

334
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,442
the man who created such
gruesome and terror films,

335
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,782
a face to face program with
'Revenge' Nageshwara Rao.

336
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,855
Greetings.

337
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,625
Puri Jagannadh goes to Pattaya
for story sittings,

338
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:01,127
Rajamouli goes to Rajasthan,
where do you go?

339
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,629
Cherlapalli jail!

340
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:06,458
My story sittings are with criminals.

341
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,469
Directors sit with story writers,
why criminals?

342
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,131
I don't sync well with writers,
criminals sync perfectly with me.

343
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:15,801
It seems you run affairs with every
heroine of your film, is it true?

344
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,138
If the chemistry between us
off the screen works out well,

345
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,147
only then chemistry between hero and
heroine on screen will work out well.

346
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:24,150
They say director is the captain
of the ship, what do you say?

347
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,151
I say its trash!

348
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,484
In my opinion director isn't
captain of ship or driver of the taxi,

349
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,991
or pirate of the plane
or owner of the wine shop?

350
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,822
Then?
- Thief!- Thief?

351
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:37,831
A thief who will steal hearts of people
and money with box office collections.

352
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,332
New idea!

353
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:44,167
They say villain in your film 'Knife-Blood'
is based on real life Don 'Crazy' Robert.

354
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,171
Is it true?

355
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:46,498
Look at that!

356
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,339
Whatever you had shown in
the film about him...

357
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,344
'Crazy' Robert is a
fearful Don to you all,

358
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:54,848
but result of my research says
he's a funny fellow.

359
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:58,180
A broker, a joker,
a loafer, a duffer,

360
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,552
he started his career as
a masseur for old women,

361
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,687
when bad time took
the toll of his boss,

362
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:07,352
luckily his time turned good and
he ended up as a Don.

363
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,692
Didn't you get any
threatening calls from him?

364
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:12,858
Once when he called and asked
Rs.4 crores, I said I'll kick him.

365
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:16,199
I told him to call
Ramgopal Verma if he wants.

366
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,533
He got scared and hang up the phone.

367
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:18,697
What's your next film, sir?

368
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,700
Part one flopped, right sir?
- That's why I'm making part two.

369
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:24,039
If this too flops?
- I'll make part three.

370
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,875
So you want to take revenge
on audience, right?

371
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:28,210
That's 'Revenge' Nageshwara Rao for you!

372
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,383
Suman was shocked with my answers.

373
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,723
He's using my phone to make calls.
- Give the phone to your director.

374
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:37,723
Okay sir.

375
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,719
It's you who would get shocked
not Suman.

376
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,558
"Crazy' Robert's phone,
shall I tell you're not here?

377
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,394
What's it, Robert boy?

378
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:48,231
Why are you blabbering nonsense?
I'll pump bullets into your mouth.

379
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,737
I'm going to Italy in 2 days,

380
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:53,569
if you've guts,
if your gun has bullets,

381
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,406
if you've ticket for the flight,
come there, let's settle it.

382
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,078
What's this sir? You're going
overboard as you get old.

383
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,409
Why are you taking on mafia
at this age?

384
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,576
Mafia mean underworld,
it means they live underground,

385
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,085
I'm not scared of people
living underground,

386
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,415
I don't respect who live up above,

387
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,921
I don't care about people next to me,

388
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,581
rhyming is perfect,
make a note of it.

389
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,418
What's it uncle?

390
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,088
'Revenge' Nageshwara Rao,
a film director has come from India,

391
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:20,259
I must show him locations,
but Karan Johar is here.

392
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,769
No problem, uncle. I'll manage
with my disciples.- Thanks dear.

393
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,096
Dasu, we're getting late.
Madam has called us, we've to go out.

394
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,105
I'm coming.

395
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:29,268
Whatever you may do, it is very
difficult to trap Janaki madam.

396
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,778
There's thrill in achieving
the impossible.

397
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:34,940
We must do some social work,
why should we bother about films?

398
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,450
This job has selfish motive too.

399
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:38,952
Selfishness and you?
I don't believe it.

400
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,454
Not my own selfishness but
selfishness for the society.

401
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,115
It sounds new,
what's the meaning of it?

402
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:46,626
I've seen this director's
tweets on Twitter,

403
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,789
he seems very radical in nature,
he doesn't respect ladies,

404
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:52,298
he has no love for children,
he has no responsibility of the society,

405
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:55,631
sex, violence, killing, plundering,
hurting, sickening thoughts!

406
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:59,469
If we change his perception and
get him to do a film on ball philosophy,

407
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,474
the message will spread around
the world easily.

408
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,977
Because cinema is a powerful media!

409
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,979
Many learnt dance after watching
the film 'Saagara Sangamam',

410
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,310
learnt music after watching
the film 'Shankarabharanam'.

411
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,474
Picked up chains watching
the film 'Shiva'.

412
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,645
Shut up! Always makes bad comparisons.

413
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:13,983
Director is here!

414
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:17,323
Tell coordinator Gopi that
my comforts are very important.

415
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,651
Gopi sent us.
- Where is he?

416
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:20,989
Is he dead?

417
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,995
He has other work, so couldn't come.
So he sent us.

418
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:26,328
He too has assistants?
- Let's sit and talk coolly!

419
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,504
What's the talk about
Sundaram Babu's film?- Disaster sir.

420
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,836
It seems all the distributors
have bought pesticides too.

421
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,171
It seems they're abusing wildly
the director and the hero.

422
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,679
I'm 'Revenge' Nageshwara Rao
from Italy.

423
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,181
What's the talk about my film?

424
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:44,343
What would people say about your film?
They call it as block buster.

425
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,684
It seems buyers and distributors have
replaced God's photos with yours.

426
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:49,689
Is it?

427
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,193
Biggest hit in industry,
enjoy the success.

428
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,854
I'll come with a story
to beat that record.

429
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,024
He's real director.
Not a bit of jealousy.

430
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,363
I'm doing my next film
with him, fixed.

431
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,700
Why did you praise a film
that has bombed?

432
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,865
It'll be 3 months before
he comes to know it's a flop.

433
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,533
By then our dates would
be confirmed.

434
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,873
Timing is more important
than talent in this industry.

435
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,207
It looks good, post it on Twitter.

436
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,374
If you tell your story,
I'll show you locations for it.

437
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,042
My requirement is story.

438
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,552
Are you here for locations
without a story?

439
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,213
I'll hit upon something
while on location hunting, right?

440
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,052
Then, you've hit on something
without even moving out, sir.

441
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,887
Madam has a readymade script.

442
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,552
If you make a film on it,
it'll create new records.

443
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,221
First tell me the story.

444
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:37,066
Once upon a time in Kottipalli,
there lived a billionaire.

445
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,731
Is his name Koteshwara Rao?
- No., Venkateshwara Rao.

446
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:45,246
Along with billions he had
a strong wish to live among billions.

447
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,905
So he spent all his wealth to build,

448
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:53,078
hospitals, orphanages, toilets,
temples, schools, roads, ponds,

449
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:59,593
and was left penniless and
shifted to a poor hut in tatters.

450
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,424
This is not a story but sorrow.

451
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,260
Not only that I've a great title
too for this story.

452
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,093
What's that?

453
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,258
'Effort can make men as saints'

454
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,426
What would they do by becoming saints?

455
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,095
They'll beg like them.

456
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,935
If I make a film on it, he'll not beg,
but I'll surely beg.

457
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:17,436
I got an idea for a block buster story
while hearing this lousy story.

458
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:18,603
Record it.

459
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,614
This story has one hero
and 5 heroines.

460
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:22,774
In the first scene,

461
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:26,821
first heroine Mona is killed by hero
by banging her head on wall.

462
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:31,291
If we tilt up the camera from
the beautiful dead body,

463
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,292
a deadly song!
- What's the song here, sir?

464
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,294
Thaman will take care of it,
you record it, man.

465
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,296
Cut it, it's second heroine Rani,

466
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:43,133
hero picks up a big boulder and
smashes the head of Rani to kill her,

467
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,638
cut it, comedy scene follows!
- Comedy scene here?

468
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,801
Two corpses were making
satires on each other. Record it!

469
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,969
Now the third heroine Mamatha,

470
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,808
he pulls her to the bathtub,

471
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,645
pushes her into it and
stamps on her neck,

472
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:56,979
kills her dastardly.

473
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:57,983
Cut it, fight scene.
- Who would he fight with?

474
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,480
With the girl's boy friends.

475
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,819
Is the girl such a bad character?
- Very bad.

476
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,825
If not why would the hero
kill the girls then?

477
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:06,655
What happened then, sir?

478
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,822
Got the story till then only,
2 pegs at night will finish it.

479
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,832
I want apt locations for this story.

480
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,494
Is this location okay to you
for the story?

481
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,004
Any location is too much
for his story.

482
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,503
Record it.

483
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:24,010
Fix the frame and ten goons are
coming at you like mad dogs.

484
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:34,186
Why am I seeing the visuals in real?

485
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,518
Still in hangover,
they're real goons.

486
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:40,192
The ball hit on wall will
always bounce back.

487
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:43,025
I got a gang caught by police
for cheating tourists.

488
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,599
They would've sent them
to take revenge on me.

489
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,200
No, they're here for me.

490
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:51,203
They're coming crazily,
it means they're 'crazy' Robert's men.

491
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,706
No, they're coming for me.
- No, for me.

492
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,869
I said for me, right?
- I too said for me, right?

493
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:57,706
Stop your argument.

494
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,871
If we get caught,
they'll lynch us.

495
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:12,051
Stop! Why should we run
when they've done the wrong thing?

496
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,217
We're dead if we're caught.

497
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:16,058
You took on death,
can't you take on them?

498
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,563
No...
- What no?

499
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,565
You wanted to jump to your death
from a mountain.

500
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:20,896
Why don't you jump on them instead?

501
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,060
How can I take on them?

502
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:25,400
Think them as Saira Banu's
boyfriends not goons.

503
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,734
Remember how she cheated you.

504
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,939
Transfer all your energy to fist.

505
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:41,254
Each of your punch must send them
like a ball into the boundary. Go!

506
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,088
Robert has network in Italy too.

507
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,423
What do you think then?
Mafia is no joke.

508
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:03,768
That's a good shot!

509
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,131
Look, how he's beating them!

510
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,803
Look how he's beating them, madam!

511
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:14,680
What a power you've madam!

512
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,341
You beat them and
say it's her power.

513
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,848
I never raised hand on Saira
who cheated me.

514
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,012
How can I handle so many men?

515
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,681
It's madam's inspiration.

516
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,691
Madam's words motivated me.
Madam's power provoked me.

517
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:26,521
Great innovation is praise.

518
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:30,860
I've gut feeling you can turn
country bomb into atom bomb.

519
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,361
You can turn coal into gold.

520
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,025
You can create Tsunami
in a swimming pool.

521
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,535
You can produce a cyclone
with a sneeze.

522
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:36,694
You can make Kung-Fu champion
of a lame.

523
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,534
You can make a dumb to do mimicry.

524
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:41,199
I've gut feeling you can turn
country bomb into atom bomb.

525
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:42,366
You can turn coal into gold.

526
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:45,207
You don't eat without doing
a good deed, sister.

527
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,542
Why are you eating madly?

528
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:51,050
I've earned myself a right to eat
for life without doing a good deed.

529
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,882
What's that life time achievement?

530
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:53,715
Not just one or two,

531
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,222
I've made a businessman
of dying Peter,

532
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,553
I've made pick-pocket James
famous all over Milan,

533
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:02,061
I've made a beggar like Dasu
a famous writer.

534
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:08,227
A boy like Rama Rao beat up
big hulk like goons.

535
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:14,400
I feel if I've so much power in me,
why should I limit myself?

536
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,408
That's why I've come to a decision.
- What's that?

537
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,740
I want to create a movement
like Anna Hazare.

538
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,406
I must stop the power cuts.
Reduce petrol price.

539
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,916
Bring prohibition.
What will you prohibit?

540
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,919
If people go blind with power,
you're blind with your innocence.

541
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,581
First ensure prohibition upstairs.
- What are you talking??

542
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:33,923
Dasu and Rama Rao are fooling you.
They're drinking upstairs.

543
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,758
My disciples will never do that.
Come, let's check.

544
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:40,926
We're still alive because of our
ancestors' good deeds and your Kung Fu.

545
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,766
If not we would've been sacrificed
to this mad madam's innocence.

546
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,601
They came for me not for her.

547
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,936
Are they from Saira Banu?
- Who is she?

548
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:52,274
You repeat her name like a kid
asking for chocolate.

549
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,780
Girls like to console a crying man.

550
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,941
That's why I created that
characterless character.

551
00:37:57,108 --> 00:38:00,282
Along with a dancer and fighter,
there's a writer too in you.

552
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,452
Dasu, you said drinking can
make me forget Saira Banu.

553
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:08,460
Why am I still remembering her?

554
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,292
That's the purpose of drinks.
- Why did the purpose fail then?

555
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,797
I think you're hurt too deeply.

556
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:16,803
Not just me, entire country's boys are
suffering because of cheats like Saira.

557
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:20,135
If I hadn't met her in 'Bommarillu' and
separated on 50 days of 'Love Failure'

558
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,299
my entire life would've
been 'Happy Days'!

559
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,467
Then, Siddarth hand is also
there in your love story.

560
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:24,806
Not just in my love story,

561
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,313
Siddarth's hand is there very
deep in everyone's love story.

562
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,644
He made girls to visit Coffee days.

563
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,809
He pampers girl friends in his films,

564
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:35,150
watching that girls ask me
to behave like that,

565
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,816
would Coffee days match
with my mass face? You're right.

566
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,154
And this 'Dil' Raju,

567
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,491
on one side he makes youth love stories
saying life without love is waste,

568
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,826
another side he makes films
saying family elders are right,

569
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,332
and confuses us,

570
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,993
already we're dying with them
and recently social networks,

571
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,332
did you see, there's a net
in the word itself?

572
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,337
It means trapping boys with a net.

573
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:55,500
Girls never read books
but are always on face-book.

574
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,339
Are they genuine at least there?

575
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,503
No! Name is Kanishka but
photo is Anushka,

576
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,513
name is Sangeetha,
photo is Samantha,

577
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,345
actually the real thing that's
destroying this country isn't,

578
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:07,353
elections, corruption, 2G or 3G,
but single G!

579
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:08,683
G for girls!

580
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:11,690
Pubs, clubs, restaurants,
resorts, malls, multiplexes,

581
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,192
for whom all these are built?

582
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:16,195
After birth their fathers,
after growing up, their boyfriends,

583
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:19,528
after marriage, their husbands,
to destroy and ruin them non-stop.

584
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,534
Tell them to ban all these for one day!

585
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,536
If India doesn't overtake
America in 30 minutes,

586
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:27,039
I'll shave my moustache,
rub my nose on ground!

587
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:33,045
Why are you getting so excited?
You mean all women are like that?

588
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,539
Except one!
- Who is it?

589
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,719
Isn't our madam a lady?
Boy?

590
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,220
Is she lady boy?

591
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,052
Yuck! She's an angel!

592
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,552
Did you ever observe Janaki madam?

593
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:50,392
I've seen her goodness only
never saw her properly.

594
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,395
She's like Goddess Mahalakshmi
in modern dress.

595
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:56,731
If she wears a sari,
she's Goddess Kanakamahalakshmi!

596
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:01,240
How can we drink as her disciples?

597
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,571
What if madam comes to know this?

598
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,576
How her sensitive heart would weaken!

599
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:08,907
Yes, if madam is angel,
Inky and Pinky are side angels.

600
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,416
They both may die in shock!

601
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,420
First time in my life
I drank listening to you.

602
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,251
I've decided this is the last!

603
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,088
Look at them!

604
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,097
Relax, they're gone.

605
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:29,102
Why didn't you praise madam directly,
why did you deride all girls first?

606
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,104
If I deride all others and praise her
only, she'll feel one of the kind.

607
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,765
Impact will be great, got it?

608
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:34,602
Pick the bottle, let's have a drink.

609
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:35,937
No bottle, you broke it, right?

610
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,104
Mad Dasu, I broke water bottle
and full bottle is there only.

611
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,277
You're frightening me, Rao!

612
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,787
Won' the ball be still bouncing
for the shot we gave last night?

613
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,947
Whatever it may be it'll not
fall in your basket.- Why not?

614
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,116
Janaki madam would wish to
become Mother Teresa,

615
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,126
she'll never wish to
become Mrs. Rama Rao.

616
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,972
Am I like Kanakamahalakshmi?

617
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,476
How could madam guess
what's in my heart?- I don't get it.

618
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:13,808
I've reformed you,
can't I get judge this?

619
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:18,651
I know you hate praise, madam,
but please don't stop me today.

620
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,811
Why are you struggling?
Come out, Rama Rao!

621
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,980
Nothing, I wanted to be
little detail, that's all.

622
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,491
Any man would go crazy for that hair!

623
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,495
Neck...neck..

624
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:33,165
Neck is necklace road.

625
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,164
Navel!

626
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:39,671
Don't speak indecently.
Waist is national highway.

627
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:43,509
May have worked for R _B,
they can't see anything else.

628
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,838
A poet has the right to compare
with anything in this world.

629
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,181
There's a good poet in you.

630
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,514
The girl who marries you is
really very lucky.

631
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:55,346
Visited a temple just now,
take offering.

632
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,015
Everything will be fine.

633
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:07,025
Rao, you're not an ordinary batsman,

634
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,364
any shot from you,
the ball will go for a six!

635
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,377
Without you...

636
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,548
Without you...darling

637
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:35,720
Waiting for you all day and night...

638
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:58,076
You're my heart and soul...

639
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:01,587
You're my moonbeam...
you're my light...

640
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:05,249
You're my destination...

641
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:09,762
I fell flat for you...
Got into lovely action...

642
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,922
I followed you...

643
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:15,093
I fell into the lock-up of love...

644
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:16,761
Fell into an unknown trans...

645
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:19,430
What a magical girl...

646
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:26,612
A danger to my life is born
like an angel...

647
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:35,185
I'm dying...I'm living on the
ventilator of your beauty...

648
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,024
Attraction...attraction...

649
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,863
Deliberation...deliberation...

650
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:58,529
May I wipe it with your sight?
I'm getting enchanted by you...

651
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,198
Anyone in this world is after you...

652
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:03,868
May I talk to you?
May I fondle you?

653
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:07,538
You're a jasmine twig...

654
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:10,879
Your blue eyes are mesmerizing...

655
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:16,041
Your smile is a flowery missile...
Take my life, my love...

656
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:09,604
DIG Balaram, a sincere officer
who made the department proud,

657
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,769
it's really unfortunate he fell
to the bullets of mafia,

658
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:14,438
young officer Adhi who worked
in his team...

659
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,790
He's an inspiration to many
young officers like me.

660
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:32,126
My life's aim is to catch badshah
who killed such a great officer.

661
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:36,795
I'm ready to sacrifice my life
to achieve it.

662
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:40,802
If silent a school master,
if flexible a dance master,

663
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:43,808
if fit a drill master,
they took on mistaking me for them!

664
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:46,136
The hunt has begun now!

665
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:49,648
The new forest officer too
can't stop me!

666
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,317
What?
- Show him the clip.

667
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:56,314
If silent a school master,
if flexible a dance master,

668
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,984
if fit a drill master,
they took on mistaking me for them!

669
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:02,494
The hunt has begun now!

670
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:06,999
The new forest officer too
can't stop me!

671
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:41,525
What is your producer saying?

672
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,865
He said your making is longer
than actual film.

673
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:47,702
Silly man! Tell him to send it to
TV channels without cutting a frame.

674
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:50,709
How do you feel about it?
- It's extra-ordinary!

675
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:52,536
Isn't it, Rama Rao?

676
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:56,540
If artistes do 10% of what director did,
every film would be a silver jubilee hit.

677
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:57,708
Isn't it, Dasu?
- Yes boss.

678
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,377
Director has shown us 10 incarnations!

679
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:01,045
You wanted to talk to me?

680
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:02,884
You're going back to
India tomorrow, right?

681
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,389
Would you like to give me company?

682
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:07,222
No, Rama Rao is a good dancer.

683
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:10,558
If you use him properly,
he would become another NTR!

684
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,223
I know your potential, Rama Rao!

685
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:13,390
Will you please stop it?

686
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,059
You're praising him
and he's feeling shy,

687
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:19,067
is entering cinema field
as easy as entering a theater?

688
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:20,572
How many great people worked here!

689
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:26,741
With such great directors here,

690
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:29,248
every idiot wants to
barge into the field!

691
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:34,253
What Surya?
Bloody idiot!

692
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,584
Who is idiot?
You're an idiot.

693
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:37,919
Your films are foolish!

694
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:40,755
Are you comparing yourself
to K V Reddy?

695
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:43,421
Tell me one film made by K V Reddy?

696
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:44,588
'Mosagaallaku Mosagaadu'

697
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:48,931
It was made by action king K S R Dass!

698
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:52,096
You calm down, I'll talk to him, madam!
Don't get emotional.

699
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:55,266
I left her because she's a girl.

700
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:59,107
I'll cut you into two!
Didn't you see my making video?

701
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:00,274
Bash him!

702
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:05,443
She asked K V Reddy's film and
you told K S R Dass's film.

703
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:06,781
'Mosagaallaku Mosagaadu'

704
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:08,445
Just now she said that.

705
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:09,613
So, tell me another film.

706
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,282
Another film...'Pandanti Kapuram'.

707
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:12,449
'Pandanti Kapuram'?

708
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,461
It was directed by Lakshmi Deepak.

709
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,293
Do you've such a good knowledge
about films?

710
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:19,627
I know much more.
- More?

711
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:24,466
Who is the first recipient of
Dada Saheb Phalke award for Telugu films?

712
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:28,302
Will you beat if I tell
correct answer?

713
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,308
I beat you for telling wrong answer.

714
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:32,140
Nageshwara Rao got it in 1990,

715
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:35,476
Bommireddy Narasimha Reddy
got it in 1974,-Who is he?

716
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:37,474
B N Reddy!

717
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:41,316
I know about B N Reddy a builder,
I didn't know there was film director.

718
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:46,155
Don't you know about B N Reddy?

719
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:48,318
Don't get tensed and spoil
your health, please come out.

720
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:49,657
You ruined her mood.

721
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:54,996
They beat me like my school
teacher Kripanandham master.

722
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:56,159
Shall I record this too?

723
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:59,004
You're so cool always,
how could you get so emotional?

724
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:00,835
How dare he abused you!

725
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,841
He's basically a bad man.
Not just me, he'll abuse anyone.

726
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,673
It's different if he abuses you
and others.- Why?

727
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,508
I said different, right?
- I'm asking why?

728
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,343
Rama Rao, you're irritating me!

729
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:11,008
I said you're different
from others, that's all.

730
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:13,681
I'm very near in achieving my goal.

731
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,204
Nobody can stop badshah
till he achieves his aim!

732
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:20,078
badshah who created a sensation
in the underworld,

733
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:22,746
to know why he's silent now,

734
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:25,587
you must know about
Royal Casino in Macau,

735
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:29,253
Baadshah's father Dhanraj used
to run Royal Casino,

736
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:33,265
Sadhu Bhai's 50% of income used
to come from Royal Casino,

737
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:36,097
Sadhu Bhai who conquered
entire South East Asia,

738
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:38,762
he couldn't dare enter Hong Kong.

739
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:44,268
Reason for it is Violent Victor
and his son Ruthless Johnny.

740
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:51,113
With Hong Kong as base, Victor who ran
drug mafia and human trafficking in India,

741
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:53,777
he laid his eyes first time
on Dhanraj's casino,

742
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:59,124
Hong Kong is Victor's area.
Deposit the money safely in bank.

743
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:35,489
Got trapped, you Dhanraj's mongrels.

744
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:37,654
What's the code number of the locker?

745
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:40,658
Tell me, if not I'll cut you.

746
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,003
Whose birthday is that?

747
00:52:54,671 --> 00:53:00,019
You got information about date,
van route, and locker code also.

748
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:04,853
But didn't know about Dhanraj's son lion
who has entered the field recently.

749
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,858
That's your biggest mistake.

750
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:09,361
That lion's name is badshah!

751
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:47,391
If you dare touch badshah,
the sound will be solid!

752
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:51,229
This is Hong Kong,
this is my dad Victor's area.

753
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:53,396
Though the pitch is yours,
the match is mine.

754
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:51,129
Tell your dad that
badshah has arrived!

755
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:54,792
If badshah decides,
war will become one sided.

756
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,642
Victor got the stick!

757
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:09,477
Jonny almost wetted his pants.

758
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:12,313
badshah, my son!

759
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:16,321
Now I've understood my son is grown up
and they've understood he's a man!

760
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:19,824
First time you've made Victor
bite dust in Hong Kong.

761
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:24,658
Why are you tensed?

762
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:26,323
Tomorrow is sister-in-law's birthday,

763
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:30,835
like every year, I've arranged for
special prayers on her name in temple,

764
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,837
but the temple is in Victor's area.

765
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:35,340
It's not right to enter the area now.

766
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:39,173
Uncle, never back off from promise given,
fixed date, it's not manliness.

767
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:40,838
No badshah...

768
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:44,675
One who fears is slave,
one who frightens is badshah!

769
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:15,380
Bhai, the man who beat Johnny
has entered our area.

770
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:22,216
Go fast!

771
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:26,390
Go fast!

772
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:30,224
I wanted to celebrate your mother's
birthday grandly when she was alive.

773
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:34,733
But I couldn't.
Now I can but she's not alive.

774
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,902
Go...go...go fast!

775
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,241
Where's badshah?
- He left, Bhai.

776
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:52,250
Why did you let him go?

777
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:53,752
Got scared on seeing him, Bhai.

778
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:00,250
Tell me, Vikram.

779
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,086
Okay.

780
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,924
Sadhu Bhai has called
a sudden meeting after 2 years.

781
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,593
He wants me to come with you.
- Where's the meeting?

782
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:12,933
Sadhu Bhai won't reveal the
spot till last minute.

783
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:22,333
Sadhu Thai, my son badshah!
- Of which country?

784
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:29,173
He was born when my father won
the title 'Baadshah' in wrestling.

785
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:33,014
Ever since then we call him as
badshah instead of his real name.

786
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:37,352
Dhanraj, you've been working
for 20 years with me,

787
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:39,357
it means I trust you!

788
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:44,020
If that was true, we won't get frisked.

789
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:47,357
Fear!

790
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:52,366
I liked your guts when you
hit Johnny inside Victor's area.

791
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:54,702
Now I like your attitude.

792
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:56,866
That's why I'm giving you
an opportunity.

793
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:59,035
It's not an opportunity
if you give it for your necessity.

794
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:02,372
What's the job?

795
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:06,544
Antony, a man who came from Kenya
to deliver a container,

796
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:10,054
Victor's men kidnapped him,
you must recover him,

797
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:13,217
because the container is
of very high value.- How much?

798
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,127
Give Macau to me.

799
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:21,896
How dare you put conditions
to my boss!

800
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:37,081
Leave him!

801
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:46,754
If you recover Antony,
Macau is all yours.

802
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:02,436
These children are flood victims.
Flood victims.

803
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,601
There's no one to inquire about them.

804
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:08,613
They don't know we're doing
business with their organs.

805
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:10,273
Shift them safely to lab.

806
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,963
Hand over the children to Indian Embassy.

807
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:00,161
Where's Antony, Johnny?
- Antony?

808
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:05,837
I don't know anything.
- I know you don't know.

809
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:09,169
Because Antony was kidnapped
by my men.

810
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:14,512
Why did you kill him, badshah?

811
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:28,359
I promised to hand over
Antony by 4 pm.

812
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:33,527
badshah will never back track
his promise, commitment.

813
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,694
The game which we're playing without
your father's knowledge with Sadhu,

814
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:38,532
we've reached the final stage.

815
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:40,197
We've to be very careful from here.

816
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:44,709
Till we achieve our aim,
think about only purpose, uncle.

817
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:46,540
Not about lurking dangers.

818
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:52,050
You've handed over Antony
as you promised.

819
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:53,543
Take it.

820
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:56,554
badshah will never take anything,
he'll conquer it.

821
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:35,759
Think of him, you're finished...

822
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:37,761
Bow your head and salute him...

823
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,264
He's Alexander in the arena...
He's badshah!

824
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:46,263
Sharp like the blade of Samurai sword
which can cut nerves of any enemy...

825
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:50,434
His walk is swift n adventurous...
Runs shivers down the spines of his enemies...

826
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:58,610
He won't rest till he reaches
the top to rule over all...

827
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:17,191
Won't stop till the victory is complete...

828
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:21,028
The world falls at your feet
if you take chances...

829
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:25,263
Unparalleled energy and
unlimited enthusiasm is his forte...

830
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:29,092
We've information that Sadhu Thai is
sending a container load of RDX from Hong Kong.

831
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:32,432
I've already talked to
the Commissioner there.

832
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:35,098
Go with your team and stop the
consignment in Hong Kong itself.

833
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:37,608
Why should we go there sir?
Can't we alert all the ports here?

834
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:40,771
They'll use the coastline for
such consignments not ports.

835
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:43,611
India has a coastline
of over 6000 kms.

836
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:45,446
They can unload it anywhere!

837
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:48,782
Till now every bit of RDX
reached India like that only.

838
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:51,118
I'll leave immediately
with my team, sir.

839
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:55,118
Keep it confidential till
the operation is completed.

840
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:57,457
Don't give any details
to your team also.

841
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:08,132
Sadhu Thai, you tried many years
to conquer Hong Kong but failed,

842
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:10,800
now I'm surrendering
Hong Kong to you,

843
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:12,977
my son is no more,

844
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:15,137
I'm not interested in anything,

845
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:19,810
the only one interest I've in
my life is Baadshah's death!

846
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:21,148
I need your help to achieve it.

847
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:22,653
He's my man.

848
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:25,486
If he was, he wouldn't have
taken Macau from you.

849
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:32,327
badshah played a drama to
take Macau by kidnapping Antony.

850
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:41,334
You remember, right?
Today is David's son's marriage.

851
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:44,175
You attend the marriage with uncle.

852
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:47,837
David uncle is very close to us.

853
01:06:48,337 --> 01:06:51,011
Everyone is getting married,
when is he going to marry?

854
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:55,512
Why marry him off now?
- Is he a little kid?

855
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:57,521
Had sister-in-law been alive,
he would've got married long back.

856
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:01,025
Uncle, forget about my marriage,
let's attend that marriage.

857
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:06,898
Bhai, badshah has left to St.Paul's church
to attend David's son's marriage.

858
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:32,720
Macau Mayor is coming to our casino,
I think your presence would be better.

859
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:34,384
I'll attend the marriage
with your uncle.

860
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:50,237
My brother dedicated his life for me.

861
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:53,744
He lived till the last moment for me.
He died for me.

862
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:55,246
We mustn't spare Victor.

863
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:58,749
Victor is not alone,
Sadhu Thai is also behind this attack.

864
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:00,914
Why would Sadhu Thai try to kill me?

865
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:03,079
He wanted to kill me not you.

866
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:23,106
I must hear the news of
Baadshah's death!

867
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:27,274
I worked 20 years loyally for Sadhu,

868
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:28,779
I got separated from my wife,

869
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:31,942
how dare he conspires to kill my son!

870
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:33,610
Did I work all these years
for such a man?

871
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:38,122
We must order,
we mustn't take orders from Sadhu.

872
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:40,453
Our courage must put an end to him.

873
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:47,625
Victor, Sadhu Thai, everyone behind
your uncle's death must die.

874
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:51,294
There must be only
one badshah for mafia.

875
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:53,133
And it must be you!

876
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:00,974
He killed my son,
he took away Macau from Sadhu Bhai,

877
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:02,138
he won't stop with that,

878
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:05,979
Singapore, Malaysia,
Hong Kong, Philippines.

879
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:09,817
His ambition is to rule over
entire South Asia!

880
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:13,654
No need of so many men, Thai.

881
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:16,490
I'll kill badshah,
his father and all others,

882
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:19,326
I'll put an end to the problem.

883
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:41,685
No use of having just intent
to kill enemy,

884
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:42,686
you must have content.

885
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:46,349
Today you'll die here.

886
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:49,860
My grandfather didn't name me
to use it as my epitaph.

887
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:51,862
To be written in history!

888
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:21,675
If you want to live be
under badshah,

889
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:24,181
if you want to die,
stand before badshah!

890
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:38,195
Victor's game is over!
The field is clear!

891
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:40,523
You're the only one left.

892
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:43,530
It isn't so easy to touch me.

893
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:47,868
Koreans, Malaysians, Indonesians,
I've killed everyone who opposed me,

894
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:49,532
and created this empire!

895
01:12:49,698 --> 01:12:52,042
badshah is here to conquer
that empire.

896
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:55,212
From today Baadshah's rule begins!

897
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:58,045
Within no time Sadhu bhai's
chapter in mafia will be over.

898
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:00,209
You don't have that capacity.

899
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:02,879
Boundaries blow up for
Baadshah's stamina!

900
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:06,219
Gang war with Sadhu Thai isn't
as easy as finishing Victor's gang.

901
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:09,226
If badshah decides
war will become one sided.

902
01:13:10,052 --> 01:13:12,225
I began the war for you.

903
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:13,731
I'll end it with you.

904
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:29,076
Victor's residence
Kowlan, Hong Kong

905
01:13:36,745 --> 01:13:39,658
You all are feeling little restless.

906
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:49,430
Bro, I committed many small mistakes
since childhood without telling you,

907
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:51,935
I wanted to come clean
about it someday,

908
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:56,600
but you died,
what should I do now?

909
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:02,275
You can confess to me.

910
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:10,951
When I was in tenth class I felt like
kissing brother's girl friend Catherine.

911
01:14:13,615 --> 01:14:16,960
It's quite common to have
such feeling in that age.

912
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:21,965
But Catherine didn't agree.

913
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:25,298
I got angry,
I raped and killed Catherine.

914
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:30,967
Not only that my brother's son Johnny,

915
01:14:31,133 --> 01:14:35,309
I got him addicted to drugs and girls
and turned him into 'Ruthless' Johnny.

916
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:39,650
My sister-in-law came
to know about this.

917
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:41,310
Left with no choice,

918
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:44,151
I doused my sister-in-law Mary
with petrol and burnt her alive,

919
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:45,986
and created it like a fire accident.

920
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:49,489
So, I went to church and
confessed about my crime to God,

921
01:14:49,651 --> 01:14:52,325
Father who was there before
you came heard everything,

922
01:14:52,821 --> 01:14:57,327
I got angry, I held him by hair
and pulled him out,

923
01:14:57,493 --> 01:14:59,734
I stamped on his neck and
strangled him to death.

924
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:04,175
I've decided no one who knows
the truth must be alive.

925
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:09,176
I had done all this scared
of my brother Victor.

926
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:17,685
There's only one man I love
and fear in this world!

927
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:23,190
badshah killed him and
left me as an orphan.

928
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:25,855
I don't have anyone now,
whom should I live for?

929
01:15:26,021 --> 01:15:28,023
I must live to kill badshah.

930
01:15:39,701 --> 01:15:42,705
Your brother died without fulfilling
his wish of killing badshah.

931
01:15:42,871 --> 01:15:45,545
Hereafter our common target
is badshah.

932
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:52,552
Shift the container immediately
to India.

933
01:15:52,714 --> 01:15:56,719
Port of Hong Kong

934
01:16:40,929 --> 01:16:43,933
You gave a shock by not revealing
about this operation till last minute.

935
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:45,100
I don't have any other choice.

936
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:48,271
Are you working for Sadhu Bhai?

937
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:55,785
Adhi, you saved the container
and did a great favour to me.

938
01:16:56,945 --> 01:17:02,952
Make your department believe that badshah
killed the police and took the container.

939
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:20,513
Bhai, not just framing badshah,
we've a chance to finish him.

940
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,814
What's this, son?
You didn't call me for 2 days.

941
01:17:27,976 --> 01:17:29,148
I'm little busy.

942
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:31,814
What busy, son?
I'm missing you very much.

943
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:33,323
When are you coming back, son?

944
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:36,827
I'm almost done here, mother.
Very soon I'll be back there.

945
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:48,501
Love you too, dear.
Be careful.

946
01:17:53,835 --> 01:17:56,509
Your papa is with me, son!

947
01:17:57,005 --> 01:17:58,006
Come!

948
01:18:13,188 --> 01:18:17,694
Are you confused to know howl
kidnapped your dad from your place?

949
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:21,538
Friend!

950
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:30,706
Why?

951
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:51,894
I'll kill your father
right before your eyes.

952
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:54,404
Get Baadshah's father!

953
01:18:59,067 --> 01:19:01,911
If tiger is inside the cell,
even kids can play with it.

954
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:05,574
When it comes out into the arena,
it begins to hunt!

955
01:19:34,936 --> 01:19:38,110
Not just Hong Kong police,
Indian police is also after you.

956
01:19:38,273 --> 01:19:42,949
You take care P my dad,
there's a solution to every problem,

957
01:19:43,111 --> 01:19:44,954
I'll find the solution!

958
01:19:58,126 --> 01:20:01,972
Was ACP Adhi the mole in department
who worked for Sadhu Bhai?

959
01:20:03,131 --> 01:20:07,637
The lie he told about badshah killing
police is evidence against him.

960
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:13,142
I've erased a number of gangsters
in the list on your instructions.

961
01:20:13,308 --> 01:20:15,481
Before I reached my final
target Sadhu Bhai,

962
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:18,488
I've become a criminal
because of Adhi's betrayal.

963
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:21,651
I can believe you but how can you
make the department believe it?

964
01:20:21,817 --> 01:20:24,821
Moreover Adhi is going
to marry my niece,

965
01:20:24,986 --> 01:20:26,488
engagement is also over,

966
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:29,491
my brother-in-law is
Commissioner of Hyderabad,

967
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:31,331
we've a family feud,

968
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:34,167
I can't tell about Adhi
and make him believe it,

969
01:20:34,329 --> 01:20:35,330
but we mustn't spare him,

970
01:20:35,497 --> 01:20:39,707
he betrayed my department,
he's out to ruin my niece's life.

971
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:46,509
We've only one source Adhi
to catch Sadhu Bhai.

972
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:51,021
He used Adhi to get us,
we must use Adhi to get him.

973
01:20:51,179 --> 01:20:54,683
And save your niece also from Adhi.
But how?

974
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:56,193
I've a plan, sir.

975
01:20:56,351 --> 01:21:00,527
Though you're not a police man,
you're taking great risk for an aim,

976
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:02,691
I'm sure you will succeed.

977
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:05,027
Where's your niece now?

978
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:12,535
badshah who came to Italy
with a purpose,

979
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:14,738
unexpectedly fell in love
with Janaki.

980
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:17,539
Daddy, sister's wedding invitations
are very good.

981
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:21,051
Your uncle has planned a grand wedding.

982
01:21:21,209 --> 01:21:24,383
Mummy called, she wanted you
to get something, right?

983
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:27,220
She will tell, she went to
the marriage 3 months earlier.

984
01:21:27,382 --> 01:21:29,055
I'm doing the shopping
like a woman here.

985
01:21:29,217 --> 01:21:33,063
Janaki, that brings to my memory,
finish your shopping in 2 days,

986
01:21:33,221 --> 01:21:34,564
we're leaving to India in 2 days.

987
01:21:34,723 --> 01:21:38,227
We're so excited about your marriage,
why are you so dull, sister?

988
01:21:38,393 --> 01:21:43,900
Any girl would feel sad as marriage
nears for leaving the loved ones.

989
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:52,582
What's the hurry?
- Hurry? The house is on fire!

990
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:54,243
Janaki's marriage is fixed,
you know that?

991
01:21:54,409 --> 01:21:58,915
As a side kick if I feel so much,
as hero how much would you feel?

992
01:21:59,080 --> 01:21:59,922
But what can we do?

993
01:22:01,249 --> 01:22:02,922
Did he go to suicide point again?

994
01:22:30,278 --> 01:22:31,951
Rama can never go away from Janaki!

995
01:22:50,131 --> 01:22:55,137
Whether you scold, beat or marry me,
you're the one I love...

996
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:13,326
Flowery Janaki...
How bashful you are...

997
01:23:13,488 --> 01:23:17,561
Come with me to your In-law's house...

998
01:23:33,508 --> 01:23:36,682
Betel leaf, nuts and calcium
is to make mouth red...

999
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:41,187
I've beauty and youth
to make you happy...

1000
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:47,531
I'll squeeze out you beauty
like honey from a comb...

1001
01:24:33,068 --> 01:24:37,574
Like cool water under the mat...
You came near me to pinch my cheek...

1002
01:24:37,739 --> 01:24:39,741
You pricked gently like
a fish bone...

1003
01:24:39,908 --> 01:24:42,081
Won't my 25 year old heart
go berserk?

1004
01:24:42,243 --> 01:24:44,245
Your mischievous eyes have
rung the bell in my heart...

1005
01:24:44,412 --> 01:24:46,756
You've made my shyness
to vanish...

1006
01:24:46,915 --> 01:24:48,758
You're a dagger to cut the night...

1007
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:51,261
You pounce on me
with all the force...

1008
01:24:51,419 --> 01:24:56,334
Fold up your dhoti and take me
along with you to world of bliss...

1009
01:24:58,093 --> 01:25:00,937
I'll swarm you like floods
breaking the dam...

1010
01:25:02,764 --> 01:25:07,770
Like a magical landmine that blew up
all the secrets on seeing you...

1011
01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:06,661
Why are you rushing, boy?

1012
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:08,830
You've taken over my beauty...

1013
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:11,170
Toast of the party...

1014
01:26:11,332 --> 01:26:13,505
Can I use as side dish
if I'm hungry?

1015
01:26:13,668 --> 01:26:18,174
I've not seen anyone like you,
I swear...

1016
01:26:18,339 --> 01:26:22,515
Well chiseled...
perfectly built...Come on, hug me...

1017
01:26:22,677 --> 01:26:27,854
Rip me,
Kiss me, my dear...

1018
01:26:29,517 --> 01:26:32,361
Don't lit fire of passion
with desire filled eyes...

1019
01:26:34,189 --> 01:26:36,362
Hit like a speeding heavy lorry...

1020
01:26:36,524 --> 01:26:39,198
I'll appreciate if you
hug me tightly...

1021
01:26:58,546 --> 01:27:02,084
ls my brother temple priest to fix
marriage if you say you love her?

1022
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:03,893
He'll kill you in encounter.

1023
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:05,395
If he kills me for loving his daughter,

1024
01:27:05,553 --> 01:27:07,396
You've been cheating him for 15 years
claiming as police officer.

1025
01:27:07,555 --> 01:27:08,226
What would he do with you?

1026
01:27:08,389 --> 01:27:10,391
He'll douse you with petrol
and burn you alive.

1027
01:27:10,558 --> 01:27:12,401
Instead of someone
who would request humbly,

1028
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,233
why did you love a man who threatens?

1029
01:27:14,395 --> 01:27:16,898
Convincing my brother isn't
as easy as blackmailing me.

1030
01:27:17,065 --> 01:27:19,739
All the men in house
are police officers.

1031
01:27:19,901 --> 01:27:24,748
Even milk man, servant or to ring
door bell, he must be a police man.

1032
01:27:24,906 --> 01:27:28,752
I've won Janaki's love, it's not
difficult to win over your brother.

1033
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:30,082
Trust me.
- Yes uncle.

1034
01:27:30,245 --> 01:27:31,747
If Rama Rao hits,
it's a goal, confirmed!

1035
01:27:31,913 --> 01:27:35,087
Flight tickets are also confirmed.
- All are together in it.

1036
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:37,127
What's there to do here?
Let's go to India!

1037
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:43,766
Our container with 2000 kgs
of RDX has reached India.

1038
01:27:43,925 --> 01:27:47,930
Hyderabad is hosting a world summit
on 20th of this month.

1039
01:27:48,096 --> 01:27:50,940
Blasts must rock Hyderabad
on the same day.

1040
01:27:51,099 --> 01:27:57,106
Bombs must go off in all major cities.

1041
01:27:57,272 --> 01:28:01,448
India would become a terrorist
country in the eyes of the world,

1042
01:28:01,609 --> 01:28:04,283
investments coming to India would stop,

1043
01:28:04,445 --> 01:28:06,118
rupee value will fall,

1044
01:28:06,281 --> 01:28:08,784
economy would fall into
unrecoverable condition.

1045
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:13,456
What's in it for us?
- Thousands of crores.

1046
01:28:13,621 --> 01:28:16,795
Alert all the gangs working
for us in India.

1047
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:21,304
You too shift to India.
ACP Adhi will help you.

1048
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:33,551
Gym bell is ringing! Get up!

1049
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:38,151
Gym bell is ringing! Get up!
- Gym bell is ringing! Get up!

1050
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:41,658
This is not Italy, if you get late
brother-in-law would kill you. Get up!

1051
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:45,491
This isn't like a family home but
a private branch of Police academy.

1052
01:28:45,820 --> 01:28:47,663
I ran away to Italy unable
to bear this torture.

1053
01:28:47,822 --> 01:28:49,995
Get ready quickly, must go before
brother comes there.

1054
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:53,503
Even TV soap operas have weekend gaps,
but no gaps for your brother's discipline.

1055
01:28:53,661 --> 01:28:55,663
Get ready quickly, if you get late,
dad will kill you.

1056
01:28:55,830 --> 01:28:57,832
When priest said life will
be on run if I marry you,

1057
01:28:57,999 --> 01:28:58,670
I was very happy-

1058
01:28:58,833 --> 01:29:00,335
but I didn't expect the run
to be like this.

1059
01:29:01,002 --> 01:29:02,504
Get up quickly.

1060
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:05,014
If you come late,
brother will kill you.

1061
01:29:06,007 --> 01:29:07,008
Your fate!

1062
01:29:46,714 --> 01:29:48,887
Good morning brother,
reached late night.

1063
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:50,222
That's why I didn't disturb you.

1064
01:29:50,385 --> 01:29:52,558
It's routine to work out
despite late night arrivals.

1065
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:54,722
What's this bulging belly?
- No shootings- Shooting?

1066
01:29:54,889 --> 01:29:57,233
I mean not much of shoot outs
to kill criminals, daddy.

1067
01:29:57,392 --> 01:29:58,894
Am I right, uncle?
- Yes dear.

1068
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:01,904
Italian mafia is sitting in home
fearing Pilli's pressure.

1069
01:30:03,064 --> 01:30:05,635
You've proved that a Pilli man
is tiger where ever he is!

1070
01:30:07,068 --> 01:30:10,641
How do the Italian police function?
- They're always in some functions.

1071
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:12,912
If I don't manage,
I may be in trouble.

1072
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:15,918
I too want to share my experience
with all of you,

1073
01:30:16,077 --> 01:30:18,284
but brother-in-law hasn't come yet.
- Not yet.

1074
01:30:28,256 --> 01:30:29,257
Good morning, brother-in-law.

1075
01:30:29,424 --> 01:30:31,267
What were you doing without
coming to gym?

1076
01:30:31,426 --> 01:30:35,272
Oxygen level has come down in house,
so jogged 3 rounds in KBR park.

1077
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:39,606
What rounds?
- What else? Jogging rounds.

1078
01:30:39,767 --> 01:30:42,941
Strange, I met Akkineni Nageshwara Rao
in the first round,

1079
01:30:43,104 --> 01:30:44,947
second round,
I met King Nagarjuna,

1080
01:30:45,106 --> 01:30:46,949
third round,
Chaitanya shook hands with me.

1081
01:30:47,108 --> 01:30:50,783
So, you're a 4th generation kid
to cover 3 generations.

1082
01:30:51,112 --> 01:30:52,455
My foot!

1083
01:30:52,613 --> 01:30:54,786
Nageshwara Rao is in America
for Tana Conference,

1084
01:30:55,116 --> 01:30:57,460
Nagarjuna is in Europe
for film shoot as usual.

1085
01:30:57,785 --> 01:30:59,287
Naga Chaitanya is in Pollachi.

1086
01:30:59,454 --> 01:31:02,628
How can Telugu industry do well
if everyone shoots out of the state?

1087
01:31:02,790 --> 01:31:05,634
You must reform not Telugu industry.
What's your weight?

1088
01:31:06,294 --> 01:31:09,468
Not what your weight should be,
uncle's asking what's your weight?

1089
01:31:10,131 --> 01:31:12,634
What's the level of your cholesterol?
- As much as he wants!

1090
01:31:14,302 --> 01:31:17,044
Can you read the name on your
pant zip without bending?

1091
01:31:27,815 --> 01:31:29,158
Very difficult, brother-in-law.
I can't see it.

1092
01:31:29,317 --> 01:31:31,820
How long?
- Since 10 years.

1093
01:31:32,487 --> 01:31:34,831
My future son-in-law is
talking bad about you.

1094
01:31:34,989 --> 01:31:37,333
He's feeling bad for having a
useless officer like you in his team.

1095
01:31:37,492 --> 01:31:39,665
Aren't you feeling bad for
getting criticized by everyone?

1096
01:31:39,827 --> 01:31:40,999
Don't you've any feelings?

1097
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:43,840
Hunger too is a feeling, right?

1098
01:31:43,998 --> 01:31:47,002
Don't always eat like a pig.
How a police officer should be!

1099
01:31:47,168 --> 01:31:48,511
He must be like a loaded gun.

1100
01:31:48,669 --> 01:31:50,012
How are you?
- Like a loaded lorry.

1101
01:31:50,171 --> 01:31:51,514
Shut up!

1102
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:54,183
Moreover you get angry too!

1103
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:01,182
Mother!
- Brother!

1104
01:32:01,349 --> 01:32:04,853
What brother?
How could you love this lousy man?

1105
01:32:05,019 --> 01:32:09,525
He doesn't deserve to be watchman here
but I'm tolerating him for you.

1106
01:32:09,690 --> 01:32:15,197
He couldn't even run 10 metres but I
used influence to make him Inspector for you.

1107
01:32:15,363 --> 01:32:16,865
Look at his face!

1108
01:32:17,031 --> 01:32:18,704
Like a shaven old monkey!

1109
01:32:18,866 --> 01:32:24,214
He's an epitome of lies, laziness,
disaster, cheating, foul!

1110
01:32:24,372 --> 01:32:26,045
It's unnecessary to talk about him.

1111
01:32:26,207 --> 01:32:28,209
Generally people die of disease
but he may die for discipline.

1112
01:32:29,877 --> 01:32:35,054
Go 4 rounds non-stop around the
compound carrying Bunty for lying.

1113
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:36,555
Watch him!

1114
01:32:38,386 --> 01:32:42,892
4 rounds non-stop!
Am I Vijayawada-Kodada bus?

1115
01:32:43,057 --> 01:32:46,061
Was it my mistake to marry her
and become in-house son-in-law?

1116
01:32:46,227 --> 01:32:46,728
Right, brother-in-law.

1117
01:32:46,894 --> 01:32:50,068
If you hadn't come to this house, forget
about belly, you would be starving.

1118
01:32:50,731 --> 01:32:53,075
Instead of looking like that,
why don't you sync with family system?

1119
01:32:53,234 --> 01:32:55,578
Is yours great royal family to sync
with your family tradition?

1120
01:32:55,736 --> 01:32:56,407
What's your surname?

1121
01:32:56,571 --> 01:32:59,074
Since it's weak cat,
if you add 'Simha' (lion) to your name,

1122
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:01,083
can you really become lions?

1123
01:33:01,242 --> 01:33:03,415
Why should he bother about
my height and weight?

1124
01:33:03,578 --> 01:33:05,751
Is he carrying me?
Bloody dirty mouth!

1125
01:33:05,913 --> 01:33:07,756
Why are you abusing my brother?

1126
01:33:07,915 --> 01:33:09,917
Getting angry if I abuse your brother,
but when he abused me?

1127
01:33:10,084 --> 01:33:11,085
I did stop him, right?

1128
01:33:11,252 --> 01:33:15,598
Almost when he's done with, he says
mother and you say brother in chorus.

1129
01:33:15,756 --> 01:33:17,758
He goes berserk like a bull in china.

1130
01:33:17,925 --> 01:33:21,930
I'm not foolish enough to know whether
you're stopping him or provoking him.

1131
01:33:22,096 --> 01:33:22,938
Who is it?

1132
01:33:23,097 --> 01:33:23,768
Brother-in-law!

1133
01:33:23,931 --> 01:33:25,604
What's the discussion without
doing the punishment rounds?

1134
01:33:25,766 --> 01:33:28,940
I'm teaching them how a
police officer shouldn't be!

1135
01:33:29,103 --> 01:33:32,277
No need of lectures for it,
simply showing you is enough.

1136
01:33:37,612 --> 01:33:41,287
If there are so many mistakes in invitations
to invite VIP's in the department,

1137
01:33:41,449 --> 01:33:44,487
how many more mistakes would you
commit in such a grand marriage?

1138
01:33:46,621 --> 01:33:47,793
Why is everyone silent?

1139
01:33:47,955 --> 01:33:50,299
About wedding invitations...
- Didn't he like it?

1140
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:53,132
He liked it, he wants to know
who got it printed.

1141
01:33:53,294 --> 01:33:54,967
Didn't you tell him?
You won't tell him such things.

1142
01:33:55,129 --> 01:33:57,131
I got it printed, brother-in-law.

1143
01:33:58,799 --> 01:34:00,472
So, it was your creation, right?

1144
01:34:00,635 --> 01:34:04,310
Yes, color, words, additions and
deletions, everything is my work.

1145
01:34:04,472 --> 01:34:06,645
Where's the title doctor
before my name?

1146
01:34:06,807 --> 01:34:09,981
Where are my degrees?
- I told them to remove it.

1147
01:34:14,482 --> 01:34:15,324
It looks like some sex specialist.

1148
01:34:15,483 --> 01:34:21,161
It looks homely.
That's why I removed all that trash.

1149
01:34:21,822 --> 01:34:23,324
Who are you to remove that?

1150
01:34:23,491 --> 01:34:25,334
My father Pilli Appa Rao toiled
for 25 long years,

1151
01:34:25,493 --> 01:34:27,166
he bicycled my way to education,

1152
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:28,500
those are the degrees I earned
with my hard work,

1153
01:34:28,663 --> 01:34:31,507
how would you know the value of it?

1154
01:34:31,832 --> 01:34:37,009
You're good for nothing.
Useless, pathetic, rogue!

1155
01:34:37,171 --> 01:34:38,844
Mother!
- Brother!

1156
01:34:39,006 --> 01:34:40,007
What brother?

1157
01:34:40,174 --> 01:34:43,348
I'd accepted him though he
failed intermediate for you.

1158
01:34:43,511 --> 01:34:47,687
I got him police job for you
though he can't spell degree.

1159
01:34:55,189 --> 01:34:55,860
Come.

1160
01:34:56,023 --> 01:35:01,029
He reacted like this for missing
degrees in the invitation card.

1161
01:35:01,195 --> 01:35:04,199
You want to change the groom.
Is it possible?

1162
01:35:04,365 --> 01:35:07,710
It will surely happen, uncle.
I trust Rama Rao!

1163
01:35:08,369 --> 01:35:10,713
I'm the new head of cultural division.

1164
01:35:10,871 --> 01:35:14,876
We've been celebrating annual day in
Lahari resorts for the past 3 years.

1165
01:35:15,042 --> 01:35:18,888
We've decided to celebrate in
Pragathi resorts this year for a change.

1166
01:35:19,046 --> 01:35:20,889
For a change we too decided the same.

1167
01:35:21,048 --> 01:35:22,550
Won't you bother about our
feelings if you decide?

1168
01:35:22,717 --> 01:35:24,219
Won't you give value to the
feelings of our employees?

1169
01:35:24,385 --> 01:35:25,887
You must do it in Pragathi resorts only!

1170
01:35:26,053 --> 01:35:28,055
What's this? We said we've
booked there only.

1171
01:35:28,222 --> 01:35:29,394
If you had, then cancel it.

1172
01:35:29,557 --> 01:35:31,730
Are you worried about losing
your commission?

1173
01:35:31,892 --> 01:35:33,394
Have you gone made after
losing money in business?

1174
01:35:33,561 --> 01:35:35,234
Why do you overact even
after we agreed?

1175
01:35:35,396 --> 01:35:38,741
This is good, I wouldn't strain myself
if you'd accepted it earlier, right?

1176
01:35:38,899 --> 01:35:41,903
Uncle, he's little hard to hear.
- Got it?

1177
01:35:42,069 --> 01:35:43,912
Stop discussion and
give payment details.

1178
01:35:44,071 --> 01:35:46,073
Last year it was Rs.4 lakhs,
now prices have gone up,

1179
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:47,913
madam says the price is Rs.5 lakhs.

1180
01:35:48,075 --> 01:35:50,749
Rs.10 lakhs? It's too much.
Rs.8 lakhs is okay to me.

1181
01:35:52,079 --> 01:35:54,423
I think his defect
is benefit to us.

1182
01:35:54,582 --> 01:35:57,085
Why are you discussing among
yourselves? Tell me your price.

1183
01:35:57,251 --> 01:35:59,253
If Rs.8 lakhs is okay to you,
then it's okay to us also.

1184
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:00,763
What okay?
- Greetings madam.

1185
01:36:00,921 --> 01:36:04,266
Our payment is Rs.5 lakhs!

1186
01:36:04,425 --> 01:36:08,271
I'm impressed with your honesty to
give discount after deal is finalized.

1187
01:36:08,429 --> 01:36:09,772
I'll send the advance by evening.

1188
01:36:09,930 --> 01:36:11,432
Bye madam.
- Bye.

1189
01:36:11,599 --> 01:36:15,103
You'll never change, people try
to squeeze maximum from customers.

1190
01:36:15,269 --> 01:36:16,441
And you try to reduce the price.

1191
01:36:16,604 --> 01:36:18,277
Never cheat those
who trust you, brother.

1192
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:19,611
Well said, mother.

1193
01:36:21,442 --> 01:36:23,115
What's this surprise visit?

1194
01:36:23,277 --> 01:36:24,278
I'm here to give you
a surprise, mom.

1195
01:36:24,445 --> 01:36:26,288
How are you doing?
- Fine.

1196
01:36:26,447 --> 01:36:28,950
Who is he?
- My friend, he'll stay with us.

1197
01:36:29,116 --> 01:36:31,118
Freshen up, let's have lunch.

1198
01:36:31,285 --> 01:36:33,629
New business? What's that?

1199
01:36:34,789 --> 01:36:36,462
We don't have experience in it.

1200
01:36:36,624 --> 01:36:38,797
What's event management that
you're doing now?

1201
01:36:38,959 --> 01:36:42,133
Decorate according to the occasion,
dinners according to their tastes,

1202
01:36:42,296 --> 01:36:43,798
cultural programs for entertainment.

1203
01:36:43,964 --> 01:36:46,467
If you combine everything and do it
for one occasion, that's wedding.

1204
01:36:46,634 --> 01:36:48,636
They don't spend pittance for parties
but for marriage they'll spend crores.

1205
01:36:48,803 --> 01:36:52,307
But who would trust and
give us marriage contract?

1206
01:36:52,473 --> 01:36:53,645
If we gain their trust,
they'll give.

1207
01:36:53,808 --> 01:36:58,154
Commissioner, you traditionally buy
jewelery from here for all your functions.

1208
01:36:58,312 --> 01:37:02,158
With that confidence I'm telling you
this wedding planner is the right choice.

1209
01:37:02,316 --> 01:37:05,820
Since you recommend him,
I'll test him in my style.

1210
01:37:05,986 --> 01:37:06,828
Where's the boy?

1211
01:37:14,328 --> 01:37:14,999
Here he comes.

1212
01:37:15,162 --> 01:37:16,163
Greetings Seth!
- Please sit down.

1213
01:37:16,330 --> 01:37:17,673
Why did you call me?
- I'll tell you,

1214
01:37:17,832 --> 01:37:20,335
my name is Subrahmanyam.
Section officer in Commissioner's office.

1215
01:37:20,501 --> 01:37:21,343
Is it?

1216
01:37:21,502 --> 01:37:24,005
Commissioner has planned his
daughter's marriage very grandly.

1217
01:37:24,171 --> 01:37:25,844
He has given me that responsibility.

1218
01:37:27,508 --> 01:37:30,182
Seth told me about you,
if we come to an understanding,

1219
01:37:30,344 --> 01:37:32,517
it'll be beneficial to you
and me too.- How is that?

1220
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:34,023
If marriage hall rent is Rs.10 lakhs,

1221
01:37:34,181 --> 01:37:37,526
we'll quote as Rs.20 lakhs,
let's share the profit 50-50!

1222
01:37:37,685 --> 01:37:40,188
If food is Rs.1000 per plate,
we'll quote it as Rs.2000 per plate.

1223
01:37:40,354 --> 01:37:42,027
Let's share it 50-50!

1224
01:37:42,189 --> 01:37:44,692
If flower decoration is Rs.5 lakhs,
let's quote it as Rs.10 lakhs,

1225
01:37:44,859 --> 01:37:46,861
Let's share 50-50!

1226
01:37:47,027 --> 01:37:49,029
Let's arrange Mumaith Khan's dance
in sangeeth program,

1227
01:37:49,196 --> 01:37:50,698
we'll pay her Rs.10 lakhs
and claim Rs.25 lakhs.

1228
01:37:50,865 --> 01:37:53,539
Let's share 50-50!
What do you say?

1229
01:37:53,701 --> 01:37:55,203
I'll beat you with slippers!

1230
01:37:55,703 --> 01:37:56,875
Get up man!

1231
01:37:57,037 --> 01:37:59,745
Will you take commissioner from
Commissioner himself, bloody criminal.

1232
01:38:00,374 --> 01:38:02,547
Do you know what marriage is?

1233
01:38:02,710 --> 01:38:05,714
Entire celebration must be
recorded in heart not on CD!

1234
01:38:06,380 --> 01:38:08,553
Marriage canopy is
sacred like temple!

1235
01:38:08,716 --> 01:38:10,718
Do you know why marriage feast
is always excellent?

1236
01:38:10,885 --> 01:38:13,388
To ensure guests eat well
and bless with heart!

1237
01:38:13,554 --> 01:38:15,556
Will you take commission from it?
Bloody crook!

1238
01:38:16,223 --> 01:38:17,725
I'm scolding you and
are you laughing?

1239
01:38:17,892 --> 01:38:20,065
Will you arrange Mumaith Khan's
dance in sangeeth?

1240
01:38:20,227 --> 01:38:22,070
Is it marriage or recording dance?

1241
01:38:22,229 --> 01:38:25,073
Seth, call Commissioner,
let's fix him.

1242
01:38:25,232 --> 01:38:27,735
No need, he's Commissioner.

1243
01:38:30,738 --> 01:38:32,240
Is he Commissioner...

1244
01:38:33,073 --> 01:38:35,747
I made a mistake sir.
- You haven't done anything wrong.

1245
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:36,581
That's your character,
I like it.

1246
01:38:36,744 --> 01:38:38,917
Seth, you've suggested a good boy.

1247
01:38:39,747 --> 01:38:41,249
I'm giving the marriage
contract to him.

1248
01:38:41,916 --> 01:38:44,089
Don't get nervous because
I'm Commissioner,

1249
01:38:44,251 --> 01:38:46,754
serve well and earn good name.
- Okay sir.

1250
01:38:46,921 --> 01:38:48,764
Seth will discuss other details.

1251
01:38:49,423 --> 01:38:51,266
Bye.
- Okay sir.

1252
01:38:51,425 --> 01:38:52,426
Thank you very much, uncle.

1253
01:38:52,593 --> 01:38:56,769
I've taken this risk because of the
trust I've on you and your mother.

1254
01:38:56,931 --> 01:38:59,605
No let ups in marriage please.
- This marriage will never happen.

1255
01:39:00,601 --> 01:39:01,944
I mean this marriage will
not happen ordinarily.

1256
01:39:02,102 --> 01:39:03,945
It'll be the craziest!

1257
01:39:07,107 --> 01:39:09,280
Welcome brother!
- Welcome brother-in-law.

1258
01:39:09,443 --> 01:39:13,289
Already your home is shining
with marriage glow!

1259
01:39:13,447 --> 01:39:15,791
Someone has blown up a bomb!
Who is it?

1260
01:39:26,460 --> 01:39:29,304
He's the wedding planner.
His name is Rama Rao.

1261
01:39:29,463 --> 01:39:30,464
Greetings uncle.

1262
01:39:30,631 --> 01:39:32,975
Marriage is 10 days away,
why have you started the celebrations?

1263
01:39:33,133 --> 01:39:35,977
Marriage in Commissioner's house
must be mind blowing!

1264
01:39:36,136 --> 01:39:36,978
You haven't yet seen the best, uncle.

1265
01:39:37,137 --> 01:39:38,480
There's much more in store!

1266
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:41,483
Is he the groom?
He's very handsome!

1267
01:39:41,976 --> 01:39:46,482
Uncle, he has hidden his six pack inside,
don't know what else he'his hiding inside?

1268
01:39:46,647 --> 01:39:48,649
Don't get angry, buddy!
Just for fun.

1269
01:39:48,816 --> 01:39:50,989
Marriage is fun!
What do you say?

1270
01:39:52,152 --> 01:39:53,654
Please come in, let's sit inside
and discuss, brother-in-law.

1271
01:39:53,821 --> 01:39:55,494
This sudden meeting has
been called to discuss,

1272
01:39:55,656 --> 01:40:01,504
our Guru Sampurnandha Swamiji has
found a defect in groom's horoscope.

1273
01:40:01,662 --> 01:40:04,666
Defect in body has medicine,
what's the remedy for horoscope?

1274
01:40:04,832 --> 01:40:05,833
Solution is water!

1275
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,843
Fool! It's not general or
mineral, it's eternal!

1276
01:40:09,003 --> 01:40:14,681
This pot which contains holy water
collected from all holy rivers,

1277
01:40:14,842 --> 01:40:18,346
bride must stand in north direction and
give it to groom's southern hands.

1278
01:40:18,512 --> 01:40:21,015
Should we go east and
sprinkle it all the way?

1279
01:40:21,181 --> 01:40:25,027
No, consecrate holy Basil plant
with this holy water.

1280
01:40:25,185 --> 01:40:27,358
We don't have basil or
jasmine plants in home.

1281
01:40:27,521 --> 01:40:29,865
If you don't have,
it's available in market,

1282
01:40:30,024 --> 01:40:32,197
we can buy one and consecrate
it in home. What do you say, Swami?

1283
01:40:32,359 --> 01:40:34,600
Time is elapsing, call the bride.

1284
01:40:39,033 --> 01:40:40,876
Take it, give it to the groom.

1285
01:40:41,035 --> 01:40:44,539
Don't give it to anyone or
let it fall down till you reach home.

1286
01:40:44,705 --> 01:40:47,709
If it falls?
- Your son will be finished.

1287
01:40:47,875 --> 01:40:50,048
Shut up, priest!
You're too superstitious.

1288
01:40:50,210 --> 01:40:51,883
Is he kid to throw it down?

1289
01:40:52,046 --> 01:40:55,391
When senior priest fixes the
marriage, nothing can stop it.

1290
01:41:03,223 --> 01:41:05,066
Uncle is half dead for
what he has done,

1291
01:41:05,225 --> 01:41:07,728
if you see angrily
he may really die.

1292
01:41:07,895 --> 01:41:08,396
Did uncle do it wantonly?

1293
01:41:08,562 --> 01:41:11,406
You're right,
I did like this in haste...

1294
01:41:20,074 --> 01:41:23,419
This marriage is not just
a contract for us,

1295
01:41:23,577 --> 01:41:25,579
we consider it as a function
in our home.

1296
01:41:25,746 --> 01:41:28,750
Leave everything to my boys
and enjoy!

1297
01:41:28,916 --> 01:41:33,592
Thank you so much, we've arranged
out house for their stay.

1298
01:41:33,754 --> 01:41:37,429
She's my daughter Janaki, the bride.
Ram's mother.

1299
01:41:37,591 --> 01:41:39,264
Greetings aunty.
- Greetings dear.

1300
01:41:39,426 --> 01:41:40,769
You're very beautiful.

1301
01:41:41,595 --> 01:41:44,269
When are you bringing home
a girl like her, Ram?

1302
01:41:44,431 --> 01:41:47,105
If you really like her,
let's take her to our home, mother.

1303
01:41:50,270 --> 01:41:53,945
I said it for fun,
marriage means fun!

1304
01:41:56,610 --> 01:41:59,113
Watching your game plan,
I feel we'll surely win.

1305
01:41:59,279 --> 01:42:01,452
But the ball isn't your
hands to start it.

1306
01:42:01,615 --> 01:42:04,459
If we get everyone to ground,
ball will come to my hand.

1307
01:42:05,452 --> 01:42:07,125
I've full faith in you.

1308
01:42:09,456 --> 01:42:10,628
What are you doing?

1309
01:42:10,791 --> 01:42:13,635
You're with bride...
- Don't panic.

1310
01:42:13,794 --> 01:42:15,967
We're not here to conduct marriage
but to stop it.

1311
01:42:16,130 --> 01:42:17,632
What are you saying?
- Yes, uncle.

1312
01:42:17,798 --> 01:42:20,142
Let's stop this marriage and take
Janaki to our home as daughter-in-law.

1313
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:21,973
What will you take with you?

1314
01:42:22,136 --> 01:42:26,482
I mean we're discussing about what and
how to take things from here?

1315
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:29,143
Isn't it?
- Stop overacting, can't tolerate it.

1316
01:42:29,476 --> 01:42:31,820
You said you'd come to India
and reached home too.

1317
01:42:31,979 --> 01:42:33,151
My brother who never trusts anyone,

1318
01:42:33,313 --> 01:42:35,987
he has given entire responsibility
of conducting marriage on you.

1319
01:42:36,150 --> 01:42:38,994
Does he know your matter?
- He knows, he's also our party.

1320
01:42:39,153 --> 01:42:40,996
What party?
<i>'</i> sangeeth party.

1321
01:42:41,155 --> 01:42:43,829
We're discussing about sangeeth party.
You too can participate.

1322
01:42:43,991 --> 01:42:45,664
Don't strain too much for
a marriage that won't happen.

1323
01:42:45,826 --> 01:42:47,499
How are you planning to
stop this marriage?

1324
01:42:47,661 --> 01:42:49,334
You mean she too...
- She knows everything.

1325
01:42:49,496 --> 01:42:50,736
She too is our party.

1326
01:42:51,331 --> 01:42:53,004
What are you doing here?

1327
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:57,505
You too are aware of everything,
we're discussing about his plan,

1328
01:42:57,671 --> 01:43:00,515
tell her how we're going
to take away their daughter?

1329
01:43:00,841 --> 01:43:02,843
Take away my daughter?

1330
01:43:03,010 --> 01:43:07,356
We're discussing about how to
take the bride to marriage hall.

1331
01:43:07,514 --> 01:43:08,857
Doesn't she know?

1332
01:43:09,349 --> 01:43:12,353
What?
- He says don't you know this also?

1333
01:43:12,519 --> 01:43:15,363
Uncle, it's part of our daily duty,
how would she know it?

1334
01:43:15,522 --> 01:43:17,365
She would get excited
if it's sari selections!

1335
01:43:17,524 --> 01:43:18,525
Well said.

1336
01:43:18,692 --> 01:43:21,195
Saris have come from Kanchi,
come and select.

1337
01:43:21,361 --> 01:43:23,068
You too come.
- Go...go...

1338
01:43:23,864 --> 01:43:26,367
Uncle, you'd have ruined entire
plan with your foolishness.

1339
01:43:26,533 --> 01:43:27,204
What to do?

1340
01:43:27,367 --> 01:43:29,870
I'm confused like state politics
don't know who belongs to which party!

1341
01:43:30,037 --> 01:43:31,209
You give me a list,
I'll by heart it.

1342
01:43:31,371 --> 01:43:32,873
What's our next move?

1343
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:36,385
We need a scapegoat for our next move.
- Scapegoat?

1344
01:43:36,543 --> 01:43:39,046
Yes sir, I've entered the home
as per the plan.

1345
01:43:39,213 --> 01:43:42,217
I need a scapegoat to stop
this marriage and trap Adhi.

1346
01:43:42,382 --> 01:43:43,725
I got it, but who is that scapegoat?

1347
01:43:43,884 --> 01:43:45,557
Are you human or beast?

1348
01:43:45,719 --> 01:43:48,723
I told you to arrest Punjagutta Pandu,
why did you arrest his son?

1349
01:43:48,889 --> 01:43:51,392
He's underground and
I got his son in school ground.

1350
01:43:51,558 --> 01:43:53,060
I thought if I arrest him,
he would come out.

1351
01:43:53,227 --> 01:43:56,572
For that will you charge
a class 2 kid with rape?

1352
01:43:56,730 --> 01:43:58,232
Class 2 kid?

1353
01:43:59,733 --> 01:44:01,576
Mother!
- Brother!

1354
01:44:01,902 --> 01:44:02,573
What brother?

1355
01:44:02,736 --> 01:44:05,910
He eats six times like a wild boar.
can't he use his brain?

1356
01:44:06,073 --> 01:44:08,417
It's better to die than
live like this.

1357
01:44:08,575 --> 01:44:11,249
Is your life worth living?
How could you love such a man?

1358
01:44:11,411 --> 01:44:13,914
Useless, stupid, wastrel, idiot...

1359
01:44:18,085 --> 01:44:20,087
Nephew, he may really kill himself.

1360
01:44:35,602 --> 01:44:37,104
You bloody fool!

1361
01:44:39,273 --> 01:44:41,617
I'm a human,
that's why I'm drinking.

1362
01:44:41,775 --> 01:44:44,278
You're a demon, that's why
you drink my blood every day.

1363
01:44:44,444 --> 01:44:46,617
You're frying deeply and eating me.

1364
01:44:47,281 --> 01:44:49,955
If God is there,
I'll also get a day!

1365
01:44:50,117 --> 01:44:55,465
I'll lynch you like a bedbug.
That's my wish...my aim...

1366
01:44:55,622 --> 01:45:00,469
Uncle, let's take over this
scapegoat's dream project. Come.

1367
01:45:08,135 --> 01:45:09,307
He got up!

1368
01:45:21,481 --> 01:45:23,825
Did I tell you not to bring it
here till marriage is over?

1369
01:45:23,984 --> 01:45:25,156
Why did you bring it here?
- No..

1370
01:45:25,319 --> 01:45:27,663
What no?
How danger it is if someone sees it?

1371
01:45:29,489 --> 01:45:31,491
What are you doing here?
Doing voodoo?

1372
01:45:31,658 --> 01:45:33,001
What's this lighting?
What's this chair?

1373
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:34,161
I beg you, uncle,
please don't shout.

1374
01:45:34,328 --> 01:45:35,830
This is dream machine not a chair.

1375
01:45:35,996 --> 01:45:38,340
I know washing machine, time machine,
what's this dream machine?

1376
01:45:38,498 --> 01:45:43,572
Dream machine is that which
makes our dream come true.

1377
01:45:44,504 --> 01:45:47,178
Uncle, every man has
a villain in his life.

1378
01:45:47,341 --> 01:45:49,844
He would be torturing us.
We can't harm him in anyway.

1379
01:45:50,010 --> 01:45:52,513
The suppression will lead us
into depression.

1380
01:45:53,347 --> 01:45:56,191
That creates tension
and we get irritated,

1381
01:45:56,350 --> 01:45:57,522
it generates vibrations in our body,

1382
01:45:57,684 --> 01:45:59,186
heart will get blocked
and mind will get struck,

1383
01:45:59,353 --> 01:46:01,026
brain will get the stroke!
- What next?

1384
01:46:01,188 --> 01:46:04,362
What next? Burial, right boys?
- Yes.

1385
01:46:04,524 --> 01:46:09,030
Americans thought advance about many
dying like this and found this machine,

1386
01:46:09,196 --> 01:46:12,040
they made a film in English
'inception' to promote this, uncle!

1387
01:46:12,199 --> 01:46:13,701
It was dubbed in Telugu too?
What was the name? - 'Arambam' (Inception)

1388
01:46:13,867 --> 01:46:18,373
Right, Chinese copied this idea
and made this duplicate.

1389
01:46:18,538 --> 01:46:21,712
Happy with our marriage plans
and he presented us with this.

1390
01:46:21,875 --> 01:46:27,382
We can dominate people who
torture us in dream and be happy.

1391
01:46:27,547 --> 01:46:29,390
Body will be fit and
our life would get saved.

1392
01:46:29,549 --> 01:46:30,220
Got it, uncle?

1393
01:46:30,384 --> 01:46:33,888
Got it, I want to sit on this
machine and enter dream world.

1394
01:46:34,054 --> 01:46:35,226
Why do you want to go, uncle?

1395
01:46:35,389 --> 01:46:36,891
Everyone one has his own
tales of sorrow.

1396
01:46:37,057 --> 01:46:39,560
I my get that brain stroke for
the torture of my brother-in-law.

1397
01:46:39,726 --> 01:46:41,399
What a difficulty you're facing!

1398
01:46:41,561 --> 01:46:44,235
So, let me join your club.

1399
01:46:44,398 --> 01:46:46,901
Okay but there are few conditions.
- What are they?

1400
01:46:47,067 --> 01:46:49,911
When you enter dream,
real life characters too come,

1401
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:51,413
you mustn't tell them
that you're in dream!

1402
01:46:51,571 --> 01:46:53,573
What if I tell?
- You'd die in dream.

1403
01:46:53,907 --> 01:46:56,251
So, whatever you want to share
about your dream,

1404
01:46:56,410 --> 01:46:58,083
it must with club members only.

1405
01:46:58,245 --> 01:46:59,588
One more important thing, uncle.

1406
01:46:59,746 --> 01:47:02,920
10 minutes in dream is equal
to 10 days in real life.

1407
01:47:03,083 --> 01:47:04,426
If I want to come out of the dream?

1408
01:47:04,584 --> 01:47:11,934
Just sing this soon,
get up...get up...my King...

1409
01:47:12,092 --> 01:47:14,595
Now I got you.
Please take me to dream quickly.

1410
01:47:14,761 --> 01:47:17,435
Okay uncle, you must be the
hero of your dream.

1411
01:47:43,123 --> 01:47:45,034
Gym bell has rung, get up quickly.

1412
01:47:45,459 --> 01:47:48,338
Drinks all the night and
gets chided by my brother.

1413
01:47:48,795 --> 01:47:50,638
Shameless man! Don't know
when would he get sense?

1414
01:47:52,132 --> 01:47:54,305
She's going to gym,
bell is ringing there.

1415
01:47:54,468 --> 01:47:57,813
Everything is routine.
But Rama Rao said its dream.

1416
01:48:34,674 --> 01:48:37,348
Welcome...welcome!

1417
01:48:45,185 --> 01:48:46,027
You are...?

1418
01:48:49,189 --> 01:48:52,363
Is it you Rama?
You act just like NTR!

1419
01:48:54,027 --> 01:48:58,533
You haven't seen much, uncle!
How great can I act!

1420
01:48:59,032 --> 01:49:02,878
You can see it in future
and beyond that!

1421
01:49:03,703 --> 01:49:06,707
That's okay! What's all this?

1422
01:49:08,708 --> 01:49:10,551
Dream! Uncle, you're in dream now.

1423
01:49:10,710 --> 01:49:14,214
We've entered your dream.

1424
01:49:15,048 --> 01:49:19,224
You say dream but my brother-in-law
is shouting like a Doberman.

1425
01:49:20,887 --> 01:49:23,390
Mad uncle! Why did you enter dream?

1426
01:49:23,557 --> 01:49:26,231
To take revenge on people
in real life.

1427
01:49:26,393 --> 01:49:28,896
Who is the villain?
- His brother-in-law Jaikrishna Simha!

1428
01:49:29,062 --> 01:49:31,406
He's calling you,
what should you do, uncle?

1429
01:49:31,565 --> 01:49:35,741
I got it, I must take revenge.
That's my wish, aim...

1430
01:49:36,903 --> 01:49:40,248
What are you waiting for?
May victory be yours!

1431
01:49:40,407 --> 01:49:41,750
I'm coming!

1432
01:49:43,910 --> 01:49:45,753
He and his bloody discipline!

1433
01:49:51,251 --> 01:49:53,424
You should've come running,
why are you coming like a hero?

1434
01:49:53,587 --> 01:49:55,589
What's the time now?
- Who knows? it you want check yourself.

1435
01:49:55,755 --> 01:49:56,426
Why are you asking me?

1436
01:50:04,097 --> 01:50:05,770
What's this language
and body language?

1437
01:50:05,932 --> 01:50:07,775
Changed...everything is changed.

1438
01:50:07,934 --> 01:50:11,279
Days I looked at kitchen when hungry
or bar when I was thirsty is over,

1439
01:50:12,606 --> 01:50:14,950
For years I cried for food
and drinks in this house.

1440
01:50:15,108 --> 01:50:16,951
I cried for good peaceful sleep.

1441
01:50:17,110 --> 01:50:20,489
Now my eyes are burning,
if anyone dares stop me...

1442
01:50:20,947 --> 01:50:22,949
They would get reduced to ashes!

1443
01:50:24,117 --> 01:50:25,790
Whether you come for fight or war,

1444
01:50:25,952 --> 01:50:27,625
whether you come with
hooligans or goons,

1445
01:50:27,787 --> 01:50:29,630
whether you come alone
or with entire family,

1446
01:50:29,789 --> 01:50:32,633
if you dare taken on me,
I'll crush you like chutney!

1447
01:50:32,792 --> 01:50:35,136
What's that arrogance?
You want to get beaten up?

1448
01:50:37,130 --> 01:50:37,801
How dare you beat my sister!

1449
01:50:37,964 --> 01:50:41,639
I'll beat you also!
- Will you beat me?

1450
01:50:43,970 --> 01:50:45,813
Leave me, I'll bite you to pieces.

1451
01:50:45,972 --> 01:50:47,974
I'll gun you down.

1452
01:50:53,146 --> 01:50:54,648
Leave me...leave me...

1453
01:50:54,814 --> 01:50:56,157
What's this fight in
dream also, uncle?

1454
01:50:56,316 --> 01:50:57,818
I entered dream to take
revenge on him, right?

1455
01:50:57,984 --> 01:50:59,986
What's the kick if you go
to climax directly?

1456
01:51:00,153 --> 01:51:01,996
You gave him a stroke, right?
Go and have a drink.

1457
01:51:02,155 --> 01:51:03,327
It won't be fine to drink
in day time.

1458
01:51:03,490 --> 01:51:05,663
Dream has no day or night.
- You say like that!

1459
01:51:11,331 --> 01:51:13,834
Leave me...leave me...

1460
01:51:15,168 --> 01:51:16,670
What happened to him?
Why is he behaving like a mad dog?

1461
01:51:16,836 --> 01:51:19,680
I'm also scared, brother.
- There's nothing to fear.

1462
01:51:19,839 --> 01:51:22,012
He has terrorized us,
you say nothing to fear.

1463
01:51:22,175 --> 01:51:25,019
I've handled a similar patient,
so I know it.

1464
01:51:25,178 --> 01:51:26,521
It's a psychological disorder.

1465
01:51:27,514 --> 01:51:32,020
It's a revolution created by
depression due to suppression!

1466
01:51:32,185 --> 01:51:34,688
If we leave them for a week
without bothering about them,

1467
01:51:34,854 --> 01:51:36,197
they'll become normal.
- What if we don't?

1468
01:51:36,356 --> 01:51:37,198
They'll not spare anyone.

1469
01:51:37,357 --> 01:51:39,268
They'll go mad and
may bite necks of people.

1470
01:51:40,527 --> 01:51:42,370
How could he catch such
a dangerous disease?

1471
01:51:42,529 --> 01:51:45,533
It's the problem created
by over domination.

1472
01:51:45,699 --> 01:51:48,043
Yes brother, I too got affected
by suppression by your domination.

1473
01:51:48,201 --> 01:51:50,875
Yes, I too fell into depression.

1474
01:51:51,037 --> 01:51:53,210
Yes brother, I too got lost
in commotion.

1475
01:51:53,373 --> 01:51:55,546
I too got those revolution thoughts.

1476
01:51:55,709 --> 01:51:58,212
Yes daddy, man will lose balance like
ball if there's too much pressure.

1477
01:51:58,378 --> 01:52:00,051
Wait dear.
You and your damn ball theory.

1478
01:52:00,213 --> 01:52:03,387
I've understood that you consider
my discipline as my domination.

1479
01:52:03,550 --> 01:52:07,555
So, be as you like till
Janaki's marriage.

1480
01:52:07,721 --> 01:52:11,294
Let's have a meeting after marriage
and make new easier rules.

1481
01:52:14,060 --> 01:52:17,303
Everyone would've got affected with
that disease if I had delayed further.

1482
01:52:17,731 --> 01:52:20,905
Keep my brother-in-law under control
till this marriage is over.

1483
01:52:21,067 --> 01:52:23,570
Leave him to me,
take care of other things.

1484
01:52:26,072 --> 01:52:27,415
What a dialogue delivery, uncle!

1485
01:52:27,574 --> 01:52:31,078
Trust me, your brother-in-law
wetted his pants!- Yes, uncle.

1486
01:52:31,411 --> 01:52:34,415
My brother-in-law won't remember
this after waking up, right?

1487
01:52:34,581 --> 01:52:35,423
He may gun me down.

1488
01:52:35,582 --> 01:52:37,755
What are you saying, uncle?
Are you mad?

1489
01:52:37,917 --> 01:52:39,260
How can he remember your dream?

1490
01:52:39,419 --> 01:52:41,262
He's new, may have got confused.

1491
01:52:42,422 --> 01:52:44,265
My personal life is very happy
now because of you.

1492
01:52:44,424 --> 01:52:45,425
What happened to your
professional life, uncle?

1493
01:52:45,592 --> 01:52:47,435
It's a total disaster!

1494
01:52:47,594 --> 01:52:50,438
Brother-in-law dominates in home
and Adhi dominates me in office.

1495
01:52:50,597 --> 01:52:52,099
Adhi brings to my memory,

1496
01:52:52,265 --> 01:52:54,609
your brother-in-law has invited Adhi's
family for breakfast tomorrow.

1497
01:52:54,768 --> 01:52:56,770
How can he take decisions
in my dream?

1498
01:52:56,936 --> 01:52:57,778
This is my dream, right?

1499
01:52:57,937 --> 01:53:00,110
They're taking the decisions.
- Then?

1500
01:53:00,273 --> 01:53:01,946
Sleeping Padmanabha Simha!

1501
01:53:02,108 --> 01:53:04,452
All these characters and
scenes are from his thoughts.

1502
01:53:04,611 --> 01:53:05,954
I got it.

1503
01:53:06,112 --> 01:53:11,118
He created this scene to take on Adhi
like I did with my brother-in-law.

1504
01:53:11,284 --> 01:53:12,285
You got it right, uncle.

1505
01:53:12,452 --> 01:53:19,301
So, you must be number one in
personal and professional life too!

1506
01:53:19,459 --> 01:53:21,132
You must be the Emperor of
your dream world.

1507
01:53:21,294 --> 01:53:22,967
That's what sleeping elderly man wishes!

1508
01:53:23,129 --> 01:53:26,303
I'm badshah! Once I decide
war becomes one sided!

1509
01:53:27,967 --> 01:53:31,312
This isn't like breakfast
but buffet in star hotel.

1510
01:53:31,471 --> 01:53:33,678
If he eats like this,
my son would become like me.

1511
01:53:53,993 --> 01:53:55,836
What?...

1512
01:53:56,830 --> 01:53:58,832
He has started it early morning!

1513
01:53:58,998 --> 01:54:03,003
He wanted to freak out till marriage,
I permitted him to.

1514
01:54:03,169 --> 01:54:06,013
Who are you to give me permissions?
My foot, damn it!

1515
01:54:10,176 --> 01:54:11,849
Firs time, he got drunk.

1516
01:54:12,011 --> 01:54:15,185
First time? I've been drinking
day and night of 20 years,

1517
01:54:15,348 --> 01:54:16,850
you know my foot!

1518
01:54:17,350 --> 01:54:18,351
Why are you staring at me?

1519
01:54:18,518 --> 01:54:20,429
Do you want to drink?
If you want, have it.

1520
01:54:20,854 --> 01:54:23,027
No need to fear any fool!

1521
01:54:23,523 --> 01:54:25,696
What?

1522
01:54:26,192 --> 01:54:29,196
He listens to you, please manage him.
- I'll take care of him.

1523
01:54:30,530 --> 01:54:32,532
Guru, he's feeling bad,
please come.

1524
01:54:32,699 --> 01:54:35,111
Should I go if he feels?
- For my sake.

1525
01:54:38,872 --> 01:54:41,216
I'm leaving because my soul mate wants it.
- Sorry, brother-in-law.

1526
01:54:41,708 --> 01:54:44,882
Got info that Sadhu bhai's men
have entered the city.

1527
01:54:45,044 --> 01:54:47,388
Intelligence reports say
they're planning something here.

1528
01:54:47,547 --> 01:54:49,720
Whatever they may do,
badshah will be behind them!

1529
01:54:49,883 --> 01:54:52,056
badshah is right before you now!

1530
01:54:55,889 --> 01:54:58,233
badshah is right before your eyes.

1531
01:54:58,391 --> 01:54:59,734
He's badshah!

1532
01:55:00,393 --> 01:55:01,565
I'm badshah!

1533
01:55:02,395 --> 01:55:04,397
If badshah decides
war will become one sided.

1534
01:55:04,564 --> 01:55:06,237
You'll vanish without a trace.

1535
01:55:06,399 --> 01:55:11,747
Don't take him seriously.
Focus on Sadhu's men.

1536
01:55:11,905 --> 01:55:13,248
Hereafter I and my team will be on it.

1537
01:55:13,406 --> 01:55:14,908
You're a Dhoni and
you've a team too!

1538
01:55:16,075 --> 01:55:20,080
Sadhu's men are not in city
for more than 30 minutes.

1539
01:55:20,246 --> 01:55:23,250
Already police know about it.
Tell them to be on high alert.

1540
01:55:23,416 --> 01:55:24,759
I've inquired after you told me,

1541
01:55:24,918 --> 01:55:28,923
Sadhu's men Crazy Robert and Rocky Rasool
are in Dog House on city outskirts.

1542
01:55:34,260 --> 01:55:35,261
Why are you dull, dad?

1543
01:55:36,596 --> 01:55:39,941
I remember your mother
on seeing Hyderabad.

1544
01:55:40,099 --> 01:55:42,943
I used to live in a small house
with you and your mother.

1545
01:55:43,102 --> 01:55:45,776
I thought money is everything to life.

1546
01:55:45,939 --> 01:55:48,442
Mother gave importance to
relationships than money.

1547
01:55:48,608 --> 01:55:50,610
I couldn't understand it then.

1548
01:55:53,947 --> 01:55:57,292
I'm sorry father for not telling
you that mother is alive.

1549
01:55:57,450 --> 01:56:01,125
I'll achieve my aim in near future
and unite you with mother.

1550
01:56:01,788 --> 01:56:03,290
Press meet? Why?

1551
01:56:03,456 --> 01:56:06,130
Asking me why? Shouldn't
people know about your talent?

1552
01:56:06,292 --> 01:56:08,465
Only then sleeping Padmanabha Simha
would get satisfied, right?

1553
01:56:08,628 --> 01:56:09,629
Yes, uncle.

1554
01:56:13,132 --> 01:56:15,476
Breaking news to you,
shocking news to department,

1555
01:56:15,635 --> 01:56:16,807
shaking news to mafia!

1556
01:56:16,970 --> 01:56:19,814
I'll catch Sadhu's men who
entered the city in one day!

1557
01:56:19,973 --> 01:56:23,819
If they listen to me, I'll arrest
them if not I'll gun them down!

1558
01:56:30,650 --> 01:56:33,859
I tolerated him till now
for my sister.

1559
01:56:35,154 --> 01:56:36,997
I must suspend him immediately.

1560
01:56:37,490 --> 01:56:41,666
Police have the information,
we mustn't delay any further.

1561
01:56:41,828 --> 01:56:43,830
Material must be dispatched tonight.

1562
01:56:43,997 --> 01:56:48,173
Any delay in this
Sadhu won't take it easy.

1563
01:56:48,334 --> 01:56:54,012
Serial bombs must rock Delhi, Mumbai,
Kolkata along with Hyderabad.

1564
01:56:54,173 --> 01:56:59,020
This must be the breaking news all
over India by tomorrow at this time.

1565
01:57:04,350 --> 01:57:05,852
Who are you?

1566
01:57:12,025 --> 01:57:18,032
Kondaveeti Simha who made many
criminals to wet pants in Kondaveedu.

1567
01:57:19,866 --> 01:57:25,714
Bobbili Simha who punished
plunderer Pasupathy in public.

1568
01:57:26,205 --> 01:57:31,883
Samarasimha who saved Rayalaseema
from the clutches of Veeraraghava's faction.

1569
01:57:33,546 --> 01:57:38,052
Lakshminarasimha who created
fear psychosis in villain Dharmabhiksham.

1570
01:57:39,886 --> 01:57:43,891
Simha who saved people of
Vijayanagar from Veerakesava.

1571
01:57:44,057 --> 01:57:50,736
Padmanabha Simha is a mix of
all the Simhas put together.

1572
01:57:50,897 --> 01:57:53,741
With that pot belly you look
like a pig in uniform.

1573
01:57:53,900 --> 01:57:55,402
What the hell can you do man?

1574
01:57:57,570 --> 01:57:59,914
Why are you wearing mask?
Dust allergy?

1575
01:58:00,073 --> 01:58:02,417
No uncle if I'm in focus,
you'll not get fame.

1576
01:58:02,575 --> 01:58:06,079
You sit in the car. I'll finish them
and credit it to your account.

1577
01:58:12,085 --> 01:58:15,259
Many innocents would die
if these bombs go off.

1578
01:58:15,421 --> 01:58:16,923
You must stop it at any cost.

1579
01:58:17,757 --> 01:58:18,963
Kill him!

1580
01:59:35,835 --> 01:59:36,677
Tell me, Ram!

1581
01:59:36,836 --> 01:59:39,339
I've recovered the RDX.

1582
01:59:39,505 --> 01:59:43,681
Since their plan has failed,
Sadhu Thai will come to Hyderabad.

1583
01:59:44,510 --> 01:59:46,353
We're nearing the target.

1584
01:59:48,181 --> 01:59:51,526
DCP Padmanabha Simha has lost balance
because of professional failures.

1585
01:59:51,684 --> 01:59:55,188
So he made statements of catching
unknown Sadhu bhai's men.

1586
01:59:55,354 --> 01:59:57,356
We apologise on his behalf.

1587
01:59:57,523 --> 02:00:00,868
We've decided to suspend
him from today...

1588
02:00:19,712 --> 02:00:22,556
That dead body is Rocky Rasool!
Sadhu bhai's man!

1589
02:00:22,715 --> 02:00:27,095
Boy, only donkeys wait for orders,
lion waits for situation.

1590
02:00:28,221 --> 02:00:30,223
I'm a police of deeds not just words.

1591
02:00:30,389 --> 02:00:32,562
I'll do what I say and
I'll say what I do.

1592
02:00:40,733 --> 02:00:43,407
Sadhu Bhai! Cancer and
AIDS may have cure.

1593
02:00:43,569 --> 02:00:45,742
But if you take on me...

1594
02:00:53,579 --> 02:00:55,581
You were sensational, uncle!

1595
02:00:55,748 --> 02:00:59,252
Your performance shattered your
brother-in-aw and Adhi got astonished.

1596
02:00:59,418 --> 02:01:03,264
I need a girl urgently now.
- What's this dirty wish, uncle?

1597
02:01:03,422 --> 02:01:04,264
What's so dirty in it?

1598
02:01:04,423 --> 02:01:06,926
Heroes have an
item song after a fight scene in films.

1599
02:01:07,093 --> 02:01:09,095
I want an item girl.
- Item girl?

1600
02:01:09,262 --> 02:01:11,936
I don't want any item girl,
either Anushka or Tamanna,

1601
02:01:12,098 --> 02:01:13,270
I don't mind both also.

1602
02:01:13,432 --> 02:01:15,776
It's not possible, uncle.
- Why not?

1603
02:01:15,935 --> 02:01:18,279
Why restrictions in dream?
Is it dream or not?

1604
02:01:18,437 --> 02:01:21,441
This is dream, we're not the deciders.
- Then, who decides?

1605
02:01:21,607 --> 02:01:23,280
Sleeping Padmanabha Simha!

1606
02:01:23,442 --> 02:01:26,616
Any girl he imagines would
entertain you.

1607
02:01:26,779 --> 02:01:28,452
Isn't it?
- Yes, uncle.

1608
02:01:28,614 --> 02:01:30,287
Who is his choice?

1609
02:02:06,819 --> 02:02:09,663
My sari is green signal to you...

1610
02:02:09,822 --> 02:02:12,666
I've brought you the sweet...

1611
02:02:24,003 --> 02:02:26,847
You're sultry hot Sun...

1612
02:02:27,006 --> 02:02:29,680
I'm a pot of chilled water...

1613
02:02:29,842 --> 02:02:32,516
Oh my God!

1614
02:02:32,678 --> 02:02:35,522
Show me, where's her house?

1615
02:02:35,681 --> 02:02:38,184
May her shyness go to hell...

1616
02:02:38,351 --> 02:02:41,025
She broke my heart into pieces...

1617
02:02:41,187 --> 02:02:43,861
Tell me what do you want?
Higher up or valley down...

1618
02:02:44,023 --> 02:02:47,232
Welcome, my name is Kanakam...

1619
02:02:49,862 --> 02:02:53,207
Come into my dreams
but nobody can get us...

1620
02:02:55,534 --> 02:02:58,208
It's normal for young
to have wet dreams...

1621
02:02:58,371 --> 02:03:01,716
If it is not satiated,
it's hell all the night...

1622
02:03:26,899 --> 02:03:29,903
All night I did that...

1623
02:03:30,903 --> 02:03:32,746
You look very cute to me...

1624
02:03:47,253 --> 02:03:52,760
If you want what you desire,
you've to spend a lot for it...

1625
02:03:52,925 --> 02:03:58,603
There's a short cut to have it
without spending a penny...

1626
02:03:58,764 --> 02:04:03,941
Get under the covers...
close your eyes...

1627
02:04:04,103 --> 02:04:09,610
Jump the bandwagon of dreams...
have a blast there...

1628
02:04:09,775 --> 02:04:12,949
Well said, my dear man...

1629
02:05:01,660 --> 02:05:07,008
Chase every day, try to impress...
why do you want to rip it?

1630
02:05:07,166 --> 02:05:12,673
Won't your time get wasted?
Won't you end with high BP?

1631
02:05:12,838 --> 02:05:18,186
I'm a queen of your cell...
let it be anyone...

1632
02:05:18,344 --> 02:05:23,851
Get into the dreams
with the snap of a finger...

1633
02:05:24,016 --> 02:05:27,190
It's bliss of heaven in
the streets of desire...

1634
02:05:57,550 --> 02:06:03,557
He's the police informer who made
months of plan to fail miserably.

1635
02:06:13,232 --> 02:06:18,580
A tip before you die,
I'll do what I planned to do.

1636
02:06:18,737 --> 02:06:21,240
There's no one to stop me.

1637
02:06:21,407 --> 02:06:23,080
There's one man!

1638
02:06:23,909 --> 02:06:25,081
Who is he?

1639
02:06:29,081 --> 02:06:34,258
I got it on seeing fear in your
eyes at the mention of Baadshah's name,

1640
02:06:34,420 --> 02:06:38,163
you'd surely die in the
hands of badshah.

1641
02:06:38,591 --> 02:06:43,097
A shocking information
before you die.

1642
02:06:43,262 --> 02:06:48,268
badshah too works for
the same officer I work for.

1643
02:06:56,275 --> 02:06:57,481
Who is that officer?

1644
02:06:59,945 --> 02:07:01,618
Who is that officer?

1645
02:07:08,954 --> 02:07:11,127
badshah is working for police.

1646
02:07:11,290 --> 02:07:15,636
Bhai, I understood it now
by the way he hit me.

1647
02:07:15,794 --> 02:07:17,467
The masked man was badshah!

1648
02:07:17,630 --> 02:07:20,634
Yes, Padmanabha Simha is a buffoon.

1649
02:07:20,799 --> 02:07:22,801
He didn't even catch
a pick-pocket till date.

1650
02:07:22,968 --> 02:07:28,646
I want both badshah behind him and
the police officer behind badshah!

1651
02:07:28,807 --> 02:07:32,653
As marriage time approaches,
I feel like a tennis ball coming at me!

1652
02:07:32,811 --> 02:07:35,655
Don't worry, let it be any problem,
I'll play football with it.

1653
02:07:35,814 --> 02:07:37,816
Please co-operate calmly!

1654
02:07:45,658 --> 02:07:48,662
You're just a wedding planner,
how dare you touch the bride!

1655
02:07:48,827 --> 02:07:50,170
What's your range and this change?

1656
02:07:50,329 --> 02:07:52,002
We don't know your caste or past!

1657
02:07:52,164 --> 02:07:53,165
What's this nasty things?

1658
02:07:53,332 --> 02:07:55,005
Why are you asking me that?
- Who should I ask then?

1659
02:07:55,167 --> 02:07:56,840
Sleeping Padmanabha Simha!

1660
02:07:57,002 --> 02:08:00,176
I've told you many times all these
characters and scenes are his dreams.

1661
02:08:00,339 --> 02:08:01,682
Why do you always ask me
the same question?

1662
02:08:01,840 --> 02:08:04,684
I got it, first time, right?
I got confused.

1663
02:08:04,843 --> 02:08:06,845
Why is he getting such lousy thoughts?

1664
02:08:07,012 --> 02:08:08,514
Don't know what he is
planning with this!

1665
02:08:08,681 --> 02:08:11,355
That's okay, Janaki won't
remember all this, right?

1666
02:08:11,517 --> 02:08:13,690
How can she remember your dream?
You speak like a mad man.

1667
02:08:13,852 --> 02:08:17,197
Don't get angry,
Padma's schemes are too confusing!

1668
02:08:17,356 --> 02:08:20,530
They've killed our informer Kesava.

1669
02:08:21,360 --> 02:08:23,704
I'm sure Sadhu Bhai is in city.

1670
02:08:24,863 --> 02:08:26,706
You be careful.

1671
02:08:26,865 --> 02:08:30,870
Nobody must know you're badshah
till the mission is accomplished.

1672
02:08:31,036 --> 02:08:33,209
My mother too doesn't know
I'm badshah!

1673
02:08:44,216 --> 02:08:45,718
Are you badshah?

1674
02:08:46,051 --> 02:08:49,555
Are the criminal entire
police department is after?

1675
02:08:49,722 --> 02:08:51,395
No, please listen to me, mother.
- What no?

1676
02:08:52,725 --> 02:08:58,300
My fears have come true!
You too just like your father...

1677
02:08:59,565 --> 02:09:02,910
Never again show your face
to me in life.

1678
02:09:03,068 --> 02:09:05,070
Mother, the reason I became
badshah is Siddhu!

1679
02:09:12,578 --> 02:09:14,580
Why hasn't he come yet, mother?
- He'll come.

1680
02:09:18,083 --> 02:09:19,926
You know I'm going to US today,

1681
02:09:20,085 --> 02:09:22,087
wished to have breakfast together,
why did you come so late?

1682
02:09:22,254 --> 02:09:24,256
If he comes late,
there will be a reason.

1683
02:09:24,423 --> 02:09:25,925
You say whatever he does is right.

1684
02:09:27,926 --> 02:09:29,769
It took time to get this printed.

1685
02:09:32,097 --> 02:09:34,441
Every day when you've coffee,
you must remember mom and me.

1686
02:09:34,600 --> 02:09:36,773
Likewise we too should think
about you while having coffee.

1687
02:09:36,935 --> 02:09:37,777
Did you see?

1688
02:09:38,771 --> 02:09:40,614
Silly!
Give me your hand!

1689
02:09:44,109 --> 02:09:47,113
He'll remember me every second now.
How is it?

1690
02:09:48,947 --> 02:09:50,449
You both should always be like this.

1691
02:09:50,616 --> 02:09:53,961
I will but I doubt him.
- Doubting me?

1692
02:09:54,119 --> 02:09:57,623
You passed civils, why are you going to
US instead of attending interview?

1693
02:09:57,790 --> 02:10:02,296
I can more there what IAS and
IPS officers earn here.

1694
02:10:02,461 --> 02:10:05,965
People think like this, that's why top
goes there and scrap remains here.

1695
02:10:06,131 --> 02:10:08,475
Where's Bombay?
Isn't it in India?

1696
02:10:08,634 --> 02:10:10,978
You got a good job offer there,
why didn't you go?

1697
02:10:11,136 --> 02:10:12,308
You could've gone there, son.

1698
02:10:12,471 --> 02:10:15,816
Mother, he was with you since birth.
I joined you much later.

1699
02:10:20,646 --> 02:10:23,820
You found me on streets and
raised me affectionately than him,

1700
02:10:23,982 --> 02:10:24,983
how can I forget that, mother?

1701
02:10:25,150 --> 02:10:27,323
If you talk about it again,
I'll kill you.

1702
02:10:27,486 --> 02:10:29,488
Look mom, he's distancing
himself from me.

1703
02:10:29,655 --> 02:10:32,329
Sorry, I'll never say that again.
- No...

1704
02:10:32,491 --> 02:10:33,663
I said sorry, right?

1705
02:10:35,327 --> 02:10:37,329
He's short tempered, mother.
- Then what?

1706
02:10:51,844 --> 02:10:54,188
I forgot my bag,
I'll get it, mother.

1707
02:10:54,346 --> 02:10:55,848
Be careful, son.
- Okay, mother.

1708
02:11:07,860 --> 02:11:09,032
Getting late, come fast!

1709
02:12:29,942 --> 02:12:33,788
No...no...I'm scared...
I'll just watch- Light it!

1710
02:12:41,954 --> 02:12:45,299
Our investigations prove Sadhu Bhai
is behind the Gulshan Chat blasts.

1711
02:12:45,457 --> 02:12:46,800
We've alerted the teams,

1712
02:12:46,959 --> 02:12:49,963
we're taking all precautions to
avoid such incidents from happening.

1713
02:12:50,128 --> 02:12:54,975
I'll ensure Govt. compensates to
the families of victims in the blast.

1714
02:12:55,133 --> 02:12:56,305
Did you see this news?

1715
02:12:56,468 --> 02:12:59,813
Bomb blast in Bombay local train.
Many innocent people died.

1716
02:12:59,972 --> 02:13:01,815
It's common in India.

1717
02:13:02,474 --> 02:13:04,545
Would you react like this
if I had died in the blast?

1718
02:13:05,143 --> 02:13:07,646
Power or poverty isn't the
biggest threat,

1719
02:13:07,813 --> 02:13:10,157
terrorists and mafia are
the biggest threat to us.

1720
02:13:10,315 --> 02:13:14,821
They must be shot ruthlessly.

1721
02:13:20,993 --> 02:13:24,497
I don't want to be a police officer
to make money or for power,

1722
02:13:24,663 --> 02:13:25,835
for the sake of my country,

1723
02:13:26,832 --> 02:13:31,838
to clean up Sadhu Thai and his gang
for killing many innocent Indians,

1724
02:13:32,004 --> 02:13:34,678
I scored 90% in Civils
with that aim,

1725
02:13:34,840 --> 02:13:36,342
I've cleared mains with 95%,

1726
02:13:36,508 --> 02:13:39,011
I got selected with high grades in
every event of the training period,

1727
02:13:39,177 --> 02:13:40,884
why did you reject me then?

1728
02:13:44,016 --> 02:13:46,189
Your father Dhanraj is the
reason for your rejection.

1729
02:13:46,351 --> 02:13:48,695
How can my father be the
reason who died 20 years ago?

1730
02:13:48,854 --> 02:13:50,356
Your father is still alive.

1731
02:13:51,690 --> 02:13:53,692
You want to kill Sadhu Bhai,

1732
02:13:53,859 --> 02:13:56,863
your father runs a casino in Macau
working under the same Sadhu Bhai.

1733
02:13:58,530 --> 02:14:01,033
We mustn't recruit candidates
criminal family history.

1734
02:14:03,201 --> 02:14:06,614
I've been trying to catch
Sadhu Bhai for 20 years,

1735
02:14:07,205 --> 02:14:09,048
your father Dhanraj is
a financial expert,

1736
02:14:09,207 --> 02:14:11,380
getting frustrated for not
getting recognition for his talent,

1737
02:14:11,543 --> 02:14:13,887
he joined Sadhu as his
financial adviser.

1738
02:14:14,046 --> 02:14:18,392
When Sadhu left India, your father
tied to take you and mother with him.

1739
02:14:18,550 --> 02:14:19,893
Your mother didn't agree.

1740
02:14:20,052 --> 02:14:25,058
She made him believe that you
and she had died in an accident.

1741
02:14:25,223 --> 02:14:27,897
Likewise she lied to you that
your father is dead.

1742
02:14:28,560 --> 02:14:33,566
I saw hope seeing fire in your
eyes and honesty in your words.

1743
02:14:33,732 --> 02:14:37,737
Infiltrate the gang with
your father's help,

1744
02:14:38,070 --> 02:14:41,745
Intelligence reports say Sadhu is
planning major blasts in India,

1745
02:14:41,907 --> 02:14:43,079
we must stop him at any cost,

1746
02:14:43,241 --> 02:14:47,246
if you do as I say, I'll drop
all the charges against your father.

1747
02:14:48,914 --> 02:14:52,953
Sadhu Thai is my target from now.

1748
02:14:54,086 --> 02:14:55,929
Operation badshah began like that.

1749
02:14:56,088 --> 02:15:01,265
He erased many gangsters joining
the gang with the help of his uncle.

1750
02:15:01,426 --> 02:15:06,603
He stopped Sadhu Thai and
saved us from a big disaster.

1751
02:15:07,265 --> 02:15:11,771
He reformed his father and
weaned him away from mafia.

1752
02:15:15,774 --> 02:15:19,119
Sorry son, I misunderstood you.

1753
02:15:20,278 --> 02:15:21,951
Father always talks about you!

1754
02:15:22,114 --> 02:15:23,286
Where's your father?

1755
02:15:51,143 --> 02:15:54,317
If children do mistakes,
parents correct them,

1756
02:15:54,479 --> 02:15:57,653
but I committed the mistake
and you corrected me.

1757
02:15:58,150 --> 02:16:01,495
I'm proud of giving birth
to such a good son!

1758
02:16:02,821 --> 02:16:05,995
I feel shame for
what had happened in Italy.

1759
02:16:06,158 --> 02:16:08,502
Without knowing about you,
I bored you with my ball philosophy.

1760
02:16:08,660 --> 02:16:12,164
You ran the show like Lord Krishna but
I called you as disciple and heir.

1761
02:16:12,330 --> 02:16:14,003
No problem, finally you called
me as lover, right?

1762
02:16:14,166 --> 02:16:16,168
Next you'd say husband!
- It isn't that easy.

1763
02:16:16,334 --> 02:16:17,836
My father must know
Adhi is a traitor.

1764
02:16:18,003 --> 02:16:20,506
He must get convinced and cancel
the marriage. How can you do it?

1765
02:16:20,672 --> 02:16:24,176
I've arranged the song, dance and
movements for tomorrow's sangeeth.

1766
02:16:24,342 --> 02:16:26,185
Sangeeth of Pilli family!

1767
02:16:27,512 --> 02:16:30,186
Sangeeth of Pilli family
must be talk of town,

1768
02:16:30,348 --> 02:16:32,692
everything is perfect, right?
- Planning is perfect sir.

1769
02:16:32,851 --> 02:16:35,855
If you don't want any spoilers,
keep Padmanabha Simha away from drinks,

1770
02:16:36,021 --> 02:16:37,523
you request him personally.

1771
02:16:38,023 --> 02:16:39,366
Go...go...

1772
02:16:39,524 --> 02:16:42,027
Brother-in-law, you're famous
with children too.

1773
02:16:42,194 --> 02:16:43,696
Fame depends on the work you do.

1774
02:16:43,862 --> 02:16:44,704
You're right, brother-in-law.

1775
02:16:44,863 --> 02:16:46,865
I've a small request.
- What's that?

1776
02:16:47,032 --> 02:16:49,535
I don't want Pilli family to become
laughing stock of the town.

1777
02:16:49,701 --> 02:16:51,203
So, please don't drink today.

1778
02:16:51,369 --> 02:16:53,212
Should I not drink for
your silly family?

1779
02:16:53,371 --> 02:16:56,545
Uncle, elderly man is requesting,
please give up for just a day.

1780
02:16:57,042 --> 02:16:59,044
I agree because of
my soul mate's request.

1781
02:17:00,212 --> 02:17:01,088
Brother!

1782
02:17:07,552 --> 02:17:09,225
Why is your brother here?

1783
02:17:09,387 --> 02:17:10,889
That is...
- Who invited him?

1784
02:17:11,056 --> 02:17:12,228
I invited him, sir.
- You?

1785
02:17:12,390 --> 02:17:14,734
He's not a relative, he's an enemy.
Do you know that?

1786
02:17:14,893 --> 02:17:16,736
Don't get angry, sir?
I know about your fight.

1787
02:17:16,895 --> 02:17:18,738
Punishment for such guys
isn't keeping them away.

1788
02:17:18,897 --> 02:17:22,242
Then?-
We must show him what he's missing!

1789
02:17:22,400 --> 02:17:25,745
He must see Pilli family's
grandeur and burn with jealous!

1790
02:17:25,904 --> 02:17:28,077
You're right!
I didn't get this idea.

1791
02:17:28,740 --> 02:17:29,912
Are you fine brother?
- Fine, dear.

1792
02:17:30,075 --> 02:17:31,076
Are you fine, sister-in-law?
- I'm fine.

1793
02:17:31,243 --> 02:17:33,245
You belittled my family
rejected my son,

1794
02:17:33,411 --> 02:17:36,255
and got your daughter
married to her lover.

1795
02:17:36,414 --> 02:17:38,416
That's why you stayed away
from us for 2 years.

1796
02:17:38,583 --> 02:17:40,585
Watch the grandeur of
Pilli family's wedding.

1797
02:17:41,253 --> 02:17:43,426
Brother!
- Please make him sit in the first row.

1798
02:17:43,588 --> 02:17:44,589
Please come, brother-in-law.

1799
02:17:45,590 --> 02:17:49,094
Thanks son! I could meet
my brother after years.

1800
02:17:49,261 --> 02:17:53,107
Thank Janaki not me,
she told me everything.

1801
02:17:54,933 --> 02:17:56,606
Welcome, brother-in-law!

1802
02:17:56,768 --> 02:17:59,271
Sangeeth is grand like marriage!
- Don't you want marriage then?

1803
02:18:00,272 --> 02:18:03,845
Just for fun!
I said marriage is fun!

1804
02:18:05,277 --> 02:18:10,283
Find badshah who is behind Padmanabha
before marriage is over.

1805
02:18:11,950 --> 02:18:13,623
I need to talk to you personally.

1806
02:18:14,286 --> 02:18:18,291
There's a marked difference in
Padmanabha's behaviour for few days.

1807
02:18:18,456 --> 02:18:19,799
I observed him.

1808
02:18:19,958 --> 02:18:22,302
<i>Some guy Bead...
- Baadshah'.!</i>

1809
02:18:22,460 --> 02:18:26,306
He's talking to him on phone.
He's in regular touch with him.

1810
02:18:26,464 --> 02:18:29,308
He meets him under the cover of darkness.
- Did you see badshah?

1811
02:18:29,467 --> 02:18:32,141
I did try but couldn't see
his face clearly in dark.

1812
02:18:32,304 --> 02:18:35,478
But one thing is sure,
he's too dangerous man.

1813
02:18:35,640 --> 02:18:37,642
You'd be shocked for this.
- What?

1814
02:18:37,809 --> 02:18:39,311
It seems he'll kill you also.

1815
02:18:39,477 --> 02:18:42,981
Some guy Siddhu...
- Sadhu Bhai!

1816
02:18:43,148 --> 02:18:45,822
That's the guy! It seems you work
with him, right?

1817
02:18:45,984 --> 02:18:47,486
Why are you telling this to us?

1818
02:18:47,652 --> 02:18:50,997
What do we get in the marriage?
I expect something from you, sir.

1819
02:18:51,156 --> 02:18:53,329
Don't tell about this to anyone.

1820
02:18:54,492 --> 02:18:57,166
Can I advice you along
with information? This is free.

1821
02:18:57,495 --> 02:18:58,166
Tell me.

1822
02:18:58,330 --> 02:19:01,334
If you get the short man a drink,
he'll cough up about badshah!

1823
02:19:01,499 --> 02:19:03,911
Drinks here...?
- This is also free.

1824
02:19:07,505 --> 02:19:09,348
What?
- A special bottle for you.

1825
02:19:09,507 --> 02:19:12,181
I've promised my soul mate
not to drink today.

1826
02:19:12,344 --> 02:19:14,688
Right but groom wants you to drink.

1827
02:19:14,846 --> 02:19:16,689
Have some juice.
- Juice is okay to me.

1828
02:19:21,519 --> 02:19:23,362
Why has he changed route
and calling me uncle?

1829
02:19:23,521 --> 02:19:25,865
Don't know what's the plan of
sleeping Padmanabha Simha?

1830
02:19:26,024 --> 02:19:26,866
You're right!

1831
02:19:31,529 --> 02:19:32,872
Uncle, juice.

1832
02:19:33,198 --> 02:19:35,610
Why two glasses?
- If you like it, you can have it.

1833
02:19:39,537 --> 02:19:42,211
Liked it, uncle?- Fantastic!
- Have that one too.

1834
02:19:45,710 --> 02:19:47,883
Can I get two more?
- Get it.

1835
02:19:48,380 --> 02:19:49,723
Did you see, Rama?

1836
02:19:54,886 --> 02:19:56,058
Juice is missing.

1837
02:19:57,389 --> 02:19:59,391
Who drank it?

1838
02:20:05,730 --> 02:20:07,573
Guests have arrived,
start the program.- Okay sir.

1839
02:20:07,732 --> 02:20:10,406
Women in the family practiced dance
for 2 days, let's start with them.

1840
02:20:10,568 --> 02:20:12,912
Dance? They can't even cook properly.

1841
02:20:13,071 --> 02:20:16,575
Would they dance too?
Guests may throw up.

1842
02:20:17,575 --> 02:20:20,920
Any function in my family
would start with my act!

1843
02:20:36,594 --> 02:20:41,594
Hail Lord Shiva and Parvathi!

1844
02:21:14,632 --> 02:21:19,479
Dance and rhythm in tune is bliss...

1845
02:21:19,637 --> 02:21:24,313
Acting and ovation is heavenly...

1846
02:21:24,476 --> 02:21:29,152
In action...in pose...

1847
02:21:31,316 --> 02:21:32,818
What's that dance?
- Bharathanatyam!

1848
02:21:32,984 --> 02:21:35,157
No, it's silly dance!

1849
02:21:35,820 --> 02:21:37,822
What's that movement like
walking in slush?

1850
02:21:37,989 --> 02:21:40,367
What's that lousy expression on face?

1851
02:21:41,493 --> 02:21:43,166
You stop it!

1852
02:21:43,495 --> 02:21:46,499
Kamalahasan cried for
banning 'Vishwaroopam',

1853
02:21:46,664 --> 02:21:49,008
if he sees this dance,
he'll die in shock.

1854
02:21:49,334 --> 02:21:52,338
Will our dances make you throw up?

1855
02:21:53,004 --> 02:21:54,677
So they had the liquor mixed juice.

1856
02:21:54,839 --> 02:21:56,341
We're fans of senior NTR!

1857
02:21:56,508 --> 02:21:58,852
You wanna watch the show!

1858
02:22:05,683 --> 02:22:07,754
Parents' threw me out of home...

1859
02:22:09,354 --> 02:22:11,698
Husband too dumped me...

1860
02:22:17,195 --> 02:22:22,195
I'm all of just sixteen,
if you marry, it's just 3 knots...

1861
02:22:38,550 --> 02:22:40,894
I went to Gudiwada...

1862
02:22:42,554 --> 02:22:45,228
I went to Guntur...

1863
02:22:50,728 --> 02:22:54,574
Eluru...Nellore...
I went to many places...

1864
02:22:54,732 --> 02:22:58,737
Wherever I gomwhatever I do...
they ask for more...

1865
02:22:58,903 --> 02:23:06,583
Bloody rogues who come
to watch the show...

1866
02:23:17,755 --> 02:23:21,760
May your home turn into gold...

1867
02:23:23,094 --> 02:23:26,769
May my body turn beautiful...

1868
02:23:28,099 --> 02:23:33,276
You're on high,
would you like to join me?

1869
02:23:33,438 --> 02:23:38,945
Will you take on the passion head on?

1870
02:23:51,122 --> 02:23:53,796
There's a hut...

1871
02:23:55,793 --> 02:23:57,966
There's a cot...

1872
02:24:04,636 --> 02:24:11,645
Hut and cot both are empty
without a man...

1873
02:24:22,987 --> 02:24:29,996
The girl is on high and
the cool night says okay...

1874
02:24:32,664 --> 02:24:40,674
My youth is for you...

1875
02:24:40,838 --> 02:24:44,513
It's going all out for you...

1876
02:24:44,676 --> 02:24:47,247
To quench desires...

1877
02:24:58,523 --> 02:25:00,525
Aren't you ashamed to get
drunk and dance?

1878
02:25:00,692 --> 02:25:02,865
You ruined Pilli family honour.
Why did you also join them?

1879
02:25:03,027 --> 02:25:04,199
They wanted me to join...
- Will you join if they ask?

1880
02:25:04,362 --> 02:25:06,205
They're senseless...
- It's not their mistake sir.

1881
02:25:06,364 --> 02:25:09,038
Who are you to tell me that?
- Your son-in-law added liquor to juice.

1882
02:25:09,200 --> 02:25:10,577
Watch this video, sir.

1883
02:25:17,875 --> 02:25:20,378
Did that short man tell
about badshah?

1884
02:25:20,545 --> 02:25:22,718
What will he say?
He's killing me for that juice.

1885
02:25:22,880 --> 02:25:26,225
No use like this,
if we kidnap Padmanabha from here,

1886
02:25:26,384 --> 02:25:27,954
our problem would get solved.

1887
02:25:29,387 --> 02:25:32,561
How dare! Will you try to kidnap me?
- Don't shout!

1888
02:25:32,724 --> 02:25:35,728
With professional jealousy of
becoming more famous than you,

1889
02:25:35,893 --> 02:25:37,236
would you stoop down to
so low level?

1890
02:25:37,395 --> 02:25:38,567
Don't shout, I'll strangle your neck.

1891
02:25:38,730 --> 02:25:42,075
Will you kill me? Kill me!

1892
02:25:44,736 --> 02:25:47,239
I've understood you and
your character.

1893
02:25:48,072 --> 02:25:51,576
You added liquor to juice and
now beat my brother-in-law.

1894
02:25:51,743 --> 02:25:53,086
Are you human or beast?

1895
02:25:53,411 --> 02:25:56,585
Why are you shouting at son-in-law?
Take it easy as fun and forget it.

1896
02:25:56,748 --> 02:25:59,422
It's not fun,
he beat my brother-in-law!

1897
02:25:59,584 --> 02:26:00,585
Son-in-law of this family!

1898
02:26:00,752 --> 02:26:03,596
How much my brother-in-law is feeling
for me? I hope this dream is true!

1899
02:26:03,755 --> 02:26:06,599
Fall at his feet and
seek his forgiveness.

1900
02:26:07,258 --> 02:26:10,102
What are you thinking?
Fall, if not marriage may get canceled.

1901
02:26:10,261 --> 02:26:11,262
Why should he?

1902
02:26:11,429 --> 02:26:14,933
Commissioner must fall at
his feet for abusing him.

1903
02:26:15,099 --> 02:26:16,942
We too have family honour.

1904
02:26:17,101 --> 02:26:18,944
Honour? Your son made a mistake,

1905
02:26:19,103 --> 02:26:20,776
instead of chiding him,
you're supporting him.

1906
02:26:20,938 --> 02:26:24,442
No use is growing like a bull,
grow your brain.

1907
02:26:26,778 --> 02:26:28,621
How dare you point finger at me!

1908
02:26:28,780 --> 02:26:31,283
If you stay here,
I'll have you thrown out.

1909
02:26:31,449 --> 02:26:33,793
We're not women to wait
till thrown out.

1910
02:26:33,951 --> 02:26:35,453
We'll smash your faces!

1911
02:26:35,953 --> 02:26:38,957
What's this nasty?
cancel marriage, that's the end.

1912
02:26:39,123 --> 02:26:40,966
If you fight,
it'll create bad image for you.

1913
02:26:41,125 --> 02:26:42,968
This marriage is cancelled!

1914
02:26:43,127 --> 02:26:45,129
Who are you to say that?
I'm telling now!

1915
02:26:45,296 --> 02:26:46,297
This marriage is cancelled.

1916
02:26:46,464 --> 02:26:48,808
Get out!
- Let's go, son. Bloody proposal!

1917
02:26:48,966 --> 02:26:52,140
Bloody? You're a bloody family.

1918
02:26:52,804 --> 02:26:55,148
Shut your gob!
- Calm down sir.

1919
02:26:56,140 --> 02:27:00,646
Your family honour isn't lost by
the cancellation of marriage.

1920
02:27:00,812 --> 02:27:03,156
It's destined that a better
son-in-law would join the family.

1921
02:27:03,314 --> 02:27:05,658
That's why this happened,
what do you say?- Yes sir.

1922
02:27:05,817 --> 02:27:08,491
That guy wasn't fitting into
the frame with Janaki madam.

1923
02:27:08,653 --> 02:27:11,497
Groom must change for colorful frame!

1924
02:27:23,668 --> 02:27:26,342
Colours...myriad of colours...

1925
02:27:26,504 --> 02:27:29,678
I want to see the colours on
cheeks of the beauty...

1926
02:27:40,184 --> 02:27:42,687
Must wear a silk sari...

1927
02:27:42,854 --> 02:27:45,357
Apply a dot...

1928
02:27:45,523 --> 02:27:48,026
Marriage band must play on...
Tie the knot with her...

1929
02:27:48,192 --> 02:27:53,699
Make her my life partner
under the canopy...

1930
02:27:53,865 --> 02:27:56,368
Tiger...tiger...
come, Tiger...

1931
02:27:56,534 --> 02:27:59,208
My beauty is sacrificed
on your altar...

1932
02:27:59,370 --> 02:28:01,873
My beautiful bud...

1933
02:28:02,039 --> 02:28:05,213
It's a rain of jasmine
in heart...

1934
02:28:54,425 --> 02:28:56,598
Get me the exotic mangoes
of Chittoor...

1935
02:28:56,761 --> 02:28:59,605
Show me the taste of
morning sickness..

1936
02:28:59,764 --> 02:29:04,941
May I share lovely hugs...
May I charm you...

1937
02:29:05,102 --> 02:29:07,104
In highs and lows,
blow up brain with my magic...

1938
02:29:07,271 --> 02:29:10,616
Would I object if you
do anything with me?

1939
02:29:10,775 --> 02:29:13,278
It may be morning sickness or anything,
my beauty and heart is yours...

1940
02:29:13,444 --> 02:29:15,947
May spread the
bed of happiness...

1941
02:30:04,328 --> 02:30:06,501
Kesava sacrificed his life
for the department,

1942
02:30:06,664 --> 02:30:08,337
it's our duty to stand by his family.

1943
02:30:08,499 --> 02:30:09,671
Take it, dear.

1944
02:30:10,835 --> 02:30:12,837
We must thank your father.

1945
02:30:13,004 --> 02:30:15,348
If you need any help, please call me.

1946
02:30:23,014 --> 02:30:27,360
I played with police of 12 countries,
you played with me,

1947
02:30:27,685 --> 02:30:31,030
I know Adhi didn't hand over RDX
to the department,

1948
02:30:31,188 --> 02:30:33,691
I know badshah is behind you,

1949
02:30:34,025 --> 02:30:36,198
tell me, where's badshah?

1950
02:30:36,360 --> 02:30:38,033
If not you will die.

1951
02:30:38,195 --> 02:30:43,042
Traitors like him betray for money,

1952
02:30:43,200 --> 02:30:46,374
but many police officers would
sacrifice life for duty.

1953
02:30:47,204 --> 02:30:49,377
Should I launch your film?

1954
02:30:49,540 --> 02:30:52,885
I saw your heroism on TV and
thought it would help my film.

1955
02:30:53,044 --> 02:30:54,045
Who would see me?

1956
02:30:54,211 --> 02:30:57,215
Crazy Robert, he would wet the
bed if he sees you with me.

1957
02:30:57,381 --> 02:30:59,054
If not?
- He would kill me.

1958
02:30:59,717 --> 02:31:02,220
What's your connection with him?
- Enmity!

1959
02:31:02,386 --> 02:31:04,059
He asked money and I said go to hell.

1960
02:31:04,221 --> 02:31:05,723
He got hurt and I got booked.

1961
02:31:05,890 --> 02:31:07,233
He made an attempt on me in Italy.

1962
02:31:07,391 --> 02:31:09,064
Why did you go to Italy
with this idly face?

1963
02:31:09,226 --> 02:31:12,571
To see locations.
But coordinator Gopi cheated me.

1964
02:31:12,730 --> 02:31:13,731
Okay, bye-

1965
02:31:15,399 --> 02:31:16,571
Why are you seeing there?
Tell me.

1966
02:31:16,734 --> 02:31:19,408
He didn't come and sent his niece.

1967
02:31:22,740 --> 02:31:24,413
Why are you seeing there again?
Tell me.

1968
02:31:24,575 --> 02:31:26,418
She came with two tails.

1969
02:31:29,747 --> 02:31:31,090
What are these breaks like power cuts?

1970
02:31:31,248 --> 02:31:32,921
That's the problem with
creators like me,

1971
02:31:33,084 --> 02:31:35,086
when we narrate anything,
characters come alive before us,

1972
02:31:35,252 --> 02:31:36,424
can't understand
if it's dream or real.

1973
02:31:36,587 --> 02:31:37,930
No doubt! It's a dream!

1974
02:31:38,089 --> 02:31:42,094
I think this is his plan to
link me up with some heroine.

1975
02:31:42,259 --> 02:31:44,102
Who is the heroine?

1976
02:31:45,763 --> 02:31:47,765
My hero is power star!
- I'm rising star!

1977
02:31:47,932 --> 02:31:50,435
Together it's multi star!
Where's the location?

1978
02:31:51,769 --> 02:31:54,113
Tell me sir.- Has Sunny Leone put on
some weight or not?

1979
02:31:54,271 --> 02:31:56,444
Why ask about taste before eating?
You going to meet her, right?

1980
02:31:58,609 --> 02:32:01,283
He Sunny Leone and
I don't see any skirt here.

1981
02:32:01,445 --> 02:32:05,621
Adhi, his father, Crazy Robert...
why are they here?

1982
02:32:05,783 --> 02:32:07,626
I got it, this is climax
to the dream.

1983
02:32:07,785 --> 02:32:11,961
He has created this scene
to play with all of them.

1984
02:32:12,123 --> 02:32:14,626
We got into this mess
because of your loud mouth.

1985
02:32:14,792 --> 02:32:16,794
Hand over the short man
to them and get us freed.

1986
02:32:16,961 --> 02:32:18,463
We've announced the release
date of my film.

1987
02:32:18,629 --> 02:32:21,633
Hand me over to them?
I'm here to finish them.

1988
02:32:21,799 --> 02:32:24,973
Aren't you ashamed to join
villains with that bull?

1989
02:32:25,136 --> 02:32:26,638
Stop shouting, where's badshah?

1990
02:32:26,804 --> 02:32:28,306
I'm before you,
and still asking where's badshah?

1991
02:32:28,472 --> 02:32:31,646
I'm badshah! If badshah decides,
war will turn one sided.

1992
02:32:41,485 --> 02:32:42,987
Ask them, let's go.

1993
02:32:43,154 --> 02:32:44,155
We must see the mood and ask
if not we'll get rapped.

1994
02:32:44,488 --> 02:32:46,331
Isn't it, Surya?
- Get lost!

1995
02:32:46,490 --> 02:32:49,164
How dare you beat me!
How dare you dominate me in my world!

1996
02:32:50,327 --> 02:32:51,670
Your world?

1997
02:32:52,830 --> 02:32:53,831
This is my man's creation.

1998
02:32:53,998 --> 02:32:56,501
What's that nonsense?
Did you drink early in the morning?

1999
02:32:56,667 --> 02:32:58,010
Am I talking nonsense?

2000
02:32:59,170 --> 02:33:00,843
All of you are my man's creations.

2001
02:33:01,005 --> 02:33:05,351
My man wishes and is determined
to make me succeed he's sleeping.

2002
02:33:05,509 --> 02:33:07,511
Where's he sleeping?

2003
02:33:08,012 --> 02:33:10,014
You mustn't tell them you're in dream.
- What if I tell?

2004
02:33:10,181 --> 02:33:11,524
You'll die in dream.

2005
02:33:12,516 --> 02:33:13,688
I'll not tell you.

2006
02:33:16,520 --> 02:33:18,363
Stop! I can't tell you!

2007
02:33:18,522 --> 02:33:20,365
I mustn't tell you,
if I tell I'll die.

2008
02:33:20,524 --> 02:33:22,868
If you don't tell
you'll surely die. Tell me.

2009
02:33:29,867 --> 02:33:33,371
Why are you rolling like a pig?
Why don't you answer us?

2010
02:33:34,038 --> 02:33:36,541
I didn't expect even in dream
I would get hurt in dream.

2011
02:33:36,707 --> 02:33:38,880
Why did he create such a situation?

2012
02:33:39,043 --> 02:33:41,216
Useless man! I don't want
any of this trash dream.

2013
02:33:41,378 --> 02:33:43,380
I must come out of this immediately.
But how?

2014
02:33:43,547 --> 02:33:50,396
Just close your eyes and sing
Get up...get up...my king...

2015
02:33:50,554 --> 02:33:52,056
What are you thinking?

2016
02:33:52,389 --> 02:33:56,394
Give me 5 minutes,
I'll tell you everything.

2017
02:34:04,902 --> 02:34:13,083
Get up...get up...my king...

2018
02:34:13,244 --> 02:34:17,420
Don't you want to get up?
Shall I wake you up?

2019
02:34:32,263 --> 02:34:35,267
How long will you sleep?
Is it lodge to sleep like log?

2020
02:34:35,432 --> 02:34:37,275
Moreover damn snores too.
Get up!

2021
02:34:37,601 --> 02:34:40,445
Get up!
- Got up!

2022
02:34:41,939 --> 02:34:44,613
Why am I still in dream?
It means China machine has failed.

2023
02:34:44,775 --> 02:34:46,277
So, never use duplicate Chinese machines.

2024
02:34:46,443 --> 02:34:48,286
What are you looking at? Get up!

2025
02:34:48,445 --> 02:34:52,450
Did Rama Rao booked me like this?
Who is Rama Rao?

2026
02:34:52,616 --> 02:34:55,119
I'll show him to you, sir.
I'm going through hell.

2027
02:34:55,452 --> 02:34:56,294
That's him!

2028
02:34:59,790 --> 02:35:01,292
He's wedding planner!

2029
02:35:01,625 --> 02:35:03,127
He's Badshah!

2030
02:35:03,794 --> 02:35:04,465
He's Badshah!

2031
02:35:04,628 --> 02:35:06,630
If he's Badshah, why did he act
like wedding planner?

2032
02:35:06,797 --> 02:35:10,142
You can never understand his moves,

2033
02:35:10,301 --> 02:35:13,305
because this is a plan
by master mind Badshah!

2034
02:35:14,305 --> 02:35:16,148
He came near Adhi with Janaki's help,

2035
02:35:16,307 --> 02:35:18,480
he used Padmanabha Simha
with dream machine,

2036
02:35:18,642 --> 02:35:20,644
he provoked and
brought you to India.

2037
02:35:20,978 --> 02:35:22,480
Like using a bait to hunt tiger,

2038
02:35:22,646 --> 02:35:25,991
Badshah used this scapegoat
as a bait.

2039
02:35:29,486 --> 02:35:34,162
This dream machine will make
our dreams come true in dream.

2040
02:35:34,325 --> 02:35:36,828
You're now in dream, uncle.
- How can he decide my dream?

2041
02:35:36,994 --> 02:35:39,497
We're not the deciders.
Sleeping Padmanabha Simha!

2042
02:35:39,663 --> 02:35:41,506
You must be the emperor of your dream.

2043
02:35:43,334 --> 02:35:46,679
So, this is not a dream.
- This is not dream but real.

2044
02:35:47,171 --> 02:35:49,515
Why did he choose me though
there are so many in home?

2045
02:35:49,673 --> 02:35:53,018
You look like tissue paper,
use and throw away!

2046
02:35:53,177 --> 02:35:55,020
It's not safe to be here.

2047
02:35:55,179 --> 02:35:58,524
Call Wilson and arrange for
a chopper in Hakimpet airbase.

2048
02:37:00,911 --> 02:37:05,758
I recruited him the day you
recovered RDX sent to India!

2049
02:37:09,753 --> 02:37:11,596
So many variations in one character.

2050
02:37:31,442 --> 02:37:34,286
He brought entire mafia to
kneels without uniform.

2051
02:37:34,445 --> 02:37:35,947
Now he's an officer with uniform.

2052
02:37:36,113 --> 02:37:39,117
If you've guts,
try to escape from him.

2053
02:37:39,283 --> 02:37:44,130
No police officer could make me
come to India for 20 years,

2054
02:37:44,288 --> 02:37:45,631
you made me come here,

2055
02:37:46,623 --> 02:37:49,797
I'll offer you whatever you ask
and do whatever you ask!

2056
02:37:49,960 --> 02:37:51,132
Leave me!

2057
02:37:53,297 --> 02:37:57,643
Loafers like him may fall
for your offers!

2058
02:37:57,801 --> 02:38:00,145
But I've an address for this dress.

2059
02:38:05,642 --> 02:38:07,986
There's a history to that name!

2060
02:38:08,479 --> 02:38:13,986
There wasn't anyone to buy NTR and
there won't be anyone in future.

2061
02:38:21,158 --> 02:38:23,661
One step forward and IG will die!

2062
02:38:50,354 --> 02:38:53,358
Did you see Scorpios blew up
with one step?

2063
02:38:53,524 --> 02:38:55,526
Your one step makes films to flop.

2064
02:40:49,473 --> 02:40:54,650
Many innocents died in
the bombs planted by you.

2065
02:40:54,811 --> 02:40:58,315
One among them is Siddhu
I love so much.

2066
02:40:58,482 --> 02:41:02,658
I had decided that day to kill you.

2067
02:41:33,183 --> 02:41:36,187
I told you
I would finish it with you!

2068
02:41:45,696 --> 02:41:48,540
All are gone!
Only I'm left.

2069
02:41:48,699 --> 02:41:50,201
You got caught!

2070
02:42:13,056 --> 02:42:16,230
Without polluting Pilli family,
I've a police officer as son-in-law.

2071
02:42:16,393 --> 02:42:18,395
It's Pilli Appa Rao's blessings.

2072
02:42:18,729 --> 02:42:19,400
When I see you happy,

2073
02:42:19,563 --> 02:42:22,908
I feel it's like
a coach seeing his student hit a six!

2074
02:42:23,066 --> 02:42:25,410
Though it's routine example,
it's new!

2075
02:42:27,237 --> 02:42:29,239
Isn't it like a dream to you, uncle?

2076
02:42:29,406 --> 02:42:30,407
Dream again?

2077
02:42:30,432 --> 02:42:32,432
<font color="#800080"><i>Thank you for watching</i>
