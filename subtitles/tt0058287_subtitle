1
00:00:32,713 --> 00:00:35,773
Obeisance to the motherland.

2
00:00:37,584 --> 00:00:40,178
Obeisance to the motherland.

3
00:00:42,522 --> 00:00:49,189
The one overflowing with nurturing
waters, food and pleasing breeze.

4
00:00:49,363 --> 00:00:53,356
The mother land, which is all
encompassing and compassionate.

5
00:00:55,535 --> 00:00:58,197
Obeisance to the motherland.

6
00:01:00,207 --> 00:01:04,303
With bright dawn and
cheerful nights.

7
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:11,144
The motherland which blossoms
with colourful flowers.

8
00:01:12,552 --> 00:01:19,151
The motherland which
is loving and nurturing.

9
00:01:20,494 --> 00:01:24,157
The one which bestows its
blessings on all her offspring

10
00:01:25,665 --> 00:01:28,327
Obeisance to the motherland.

11
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,162
Obeisance to the motherland.

12
00:02:44,778 --> 00:02:49,340
Election is a way
of living together.

13
00:02:50,584 --> 00:02:55,351
We can either rule over each
other by use of power.

14
00:02:57,257 --> 00:03:00,192
Or select one of our own,
and make a government..

15
00:03:04,531 --> 00:03:08,661
To live your life properly you
need a proper government.

16
00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:13,127
And for a proper government
you need proper people.

17
00:03:14,474 --> 00:03:18,205
Our government will be our future.

18
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:22,141
That's why consider
your precious votes..

19
00:03:22,215 --> 00:03:24,206
..to be your valuable future.

20
00:03:24,317 --> 00:03:29,311
All hail to uncle Acharya.

21
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:34,654
Mr. Acharya is great leader.
All the people support him.

22
00:03:35,495 --> 00:03:37,486
But he doesn't have
the power of money.

23
00:03:38,498 --> 00:03:40,489
And money is God.

24
00:03:41,434 --> 00:03:45,165
These days' people praise money,
not great thoughts.

25
00:03:45,338 --> 00:03:47,169
Then too it's very
difficult for me..

26
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,502
..to win the election against him.

27
00:03:48,675 --> 00:03:50,165
lt is impossible.

28
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,341
We don't want to win the elections.

29
00:03:52,779 --> 00:03:54,508
We will buy out the elections.

30
00:03:55,682 --> 00:03:57,513
We will give money in
exchange of votes.

31
00:03:58,518 --> 00:04:03,114
And we want you to destroy Mr.
Acharya's socialism.

32
00:04:03,523 --> 00:04:06,117
Politics has become a business too.

33
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,121
lt's matter of crores of rupees.

34
00:04:10,397 --> 00:04:13,127
The factories and the mills..

35
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:15,133
..which our ancestors
have left for us..

36
00:04:15,201 --> 00:04:18,295
..are being charged by tax,
super tax and penalties.

37
00:04:19,673 --> 00:04:22,301
Our official consulates
are being inquired.

38
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:26,311
Our licences for import and
export are being cancelled.

39
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:27,673
And that Acharya is behind all this.

40
00:04:27,747 --> 00:04:29,612
And l want to get rid of Acharya.

41
00:04:29,683 --> 00:04:32,550
Absolutely! We should have the
government in our hands.

42
00:04:32,619 --> 00:04:34,484
Yes! Other wise we won't be
able to run our businesses.

43
00:04:34,554 --> 00:04:37,648
Dagha!
- Yes sir.

44
00:04:38,491 --> 00:04:40,425
Today we have a meeting with
Acharya in the evening.

45
00:04:40,493 --> 00:04:42,154
Are you ready?
- Absolutely!

46
00:04:42,495 --> 00:04:45,157
Three bombs are ready.
lt must be enough.

47
00:04:45,432 --> 00:04:47,559
You will explode a bomb
in the meeting?!

48
00:04:47,701 --> 00:04:50,329
You do a business in leadership.

49
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,333
And l do business in blowing things.

50
00:04:55,508 --> 00:04:57,339
How come this list
in this document?

51
00:04:58,178 --> 00:05:03,275
Editor Vijay Khanna
of Yong Leader warns..

52
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:07,616
..that very soon a
bomb of nutheaded rebels..

53
00:05:07,754 --> 00:05:09,722
..is going to blast
on Acharya's patriotism.

54
00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:11,188
What nonsense is this?

55
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:13,282
From where this you
got this piece of crap?

56
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,461
Look at this.

57
00:05:20,634 --> 00:05:22,625
News of the entire
nation on the front page.

58
00:05:22,702 --> 00:05:26,138
And photographs of nude
girls on the back page.

59
00:05:26,206 --> 00:05:28,140
Who is this Vijay Khanna?

60
00:05:28,308 --> 00:05:30,139
Who is afraid of him?

61
00:05:33,613 --> 00:05:36,480
Sister! lt's a trunk
call from father.

62
00:05:36,549 --> 00:05:38,141
No complaints, please.

63
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,479
l have to complaint.
- No, sister, please.

64
00:05:40,553 --> 00:05:41,611
Sister, please!

65
00:05:41,688 --> 00:05:43,155
Okay then, hold your ears.
- Here.

66
00:05:43,323 --> 00:05:45,484
Now ten sit ups. Till ten!

67
00:05:46,326 --> 00:05:47,486
No, sister, please.

68
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,619
Will you go late to the school?
- No!

69
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,491
Third rated editor of an
even more downrated newspaper.

70
00:05:52,565 --> 00:05:54,226
..you have become a student
of that bloody Vijay Khanna.

71
00:05:54,567 --> 00:05:56,501
Yes! That l understood, sister.
But that phone..

72
00:05:58,171 --> 00:06:00,162
The trunk call has been connected.

73
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:03,768
Your highness, the trunk call
has been connected. - Give.

74
00:06:04,511 --> 00:06:05,569
Hello.

75
00:06:05,645 --> 00:06:09,103
The reason behind sending
you two to Bombay..

76
00:06:09,182 --> 00:06:13,118
..and getting educated
there so that..

77
00:06:13,186 --> 00:06:16,622
..you can learn how live
like an ordinary person.

78
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,121
Yes, father. l have
understood properly..

79
00:06:19,192 --> 00:06:21,183
..your aim and the
value of your time.

80
00:06:21,461 --> 00:06:23,622
Only understanding is not enough.

81
00:06:23,797 --> 00:06:25,526
You should also put it to practice.

82
00:06:25,665 --> 00:06:28,463
l also practice it, father.
- Bravo!

83
00:06:29,469 --> 00:06:32,632
Hello. Even give my regards
too, your highness.

84
00:06:34,407 --> 00:06:36,534
Dear, Gen. Mahipat wants
to talk to you.

85
00:06:41,548 --> 00:06:45,314
Hello, Sunita. l'm Gen.
Mahipat speaking.

86
00:06:45,552 --> 00:06:47,144
Hello, Gen.

87
00:06:50,757 --> 00:06:52,486
Hello.
- Hello.

88
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:54,490
Did you call for me?
- Yes.

89
00:07:02,502 --> 00:07:04,493
Hey, what's this?

90
00:07:05,271 --> 00:07:07,364
Sunita, you are a girl.

91
00:07:07,507 --> 00:07:09,600
You are also the princess
of a kingdom.

92
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,442
lt doesn't looks nice that a
two bits worth newspaper..

93
00:07:12,512 --> 00:07:14,275
..should ruin your name like this.

94
00:07:14,514 --> 00:07:17,108
But l'm telling you the truth,
it's not my picture.

95
00:07:18,451 --> 00:07:21,284
They have glued my face
on someone else's body.

96
00:07:22,388 --> 00:07:24,288
l know who must have done this.

97
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,449
Before creating any situation
you should consider..

98
00:07:26,526 --> 00:07:29,120
..that your father has sent
you so far from your castle..

99
00:07:29,195 --> 00:07:31,129
..to the city so that
you can understand..

100
00:07:31,197 --> 00:07:34,132
..how to live peacefully
among people.

101
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,131
You can learn from it.

102
00:07:36,202 --> 00:07:38,670
You shouldn't do anything who
will instigates against you.

103
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:41,198
l'm only obeying his orders,
Mr. Acharya.

104
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:44,135
No one even knows who am l.

105
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,403
So, how can this be related
to my kingdom?

106
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,538
The relations are between humans.

107
00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:51,208
People shouldn't be discriminated
by status.

108
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:55,480
lf you get the time then join me
in the meeting in the evening.

109
00:07:55,622 --> 00:07:58,147
The path which we are about choose..

110
00:07:58,224 --> 00:08:01,250
..is the path of that new life..

111
00:08:01,327 --> 00:08:04,262
..on which every man
of this country..

112
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:07,265
..will get food to eat,
water to drink..

113
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:11,827
..and love to share which
they have a right on it.

114
00:08:13,306 --> 00:08:17,265
To achieve this right we
don't need those people..

115
00:08:17,343 --> 00:08:22,713
..who chant the talks of truth
but are actually filthy liars.

116
00:08:23,516 --> 00:08:27,282
lt is read in history that
such low people have done..

117
00:08:27,353 --> 00:08:31,289
..acts of deceit and talking
fraud has ruined our country.

118
00:08:32,392 --> 00:08:35,122
Some rich and selfish men
want to get rid of me..

119
00:08:35,195 --> 00:08:38,460
..with the power of their money.

120
00:08:39,465 --> 00:08:42,127
lt is possible that can
succeed in their aim.

121
00:08:42,535 --> 00:08:46,301
But those people, whom
l address as traitors..

122
00:08:46,372 --> 00:08:51,810
..can never destroy socialism
created by Jawaharlal Nehru.

123
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,314
lt is read in history that
such low people have done..

124
00:08:58,384 --> 00:09:02,150
..acts of deceit and talking
fraud has ruined our country.

125
00:09:05,258 --> 00:09:07,089
You should also know that..

126
00:09:07,493 --> 00:09:10,428
..this will be decided
only by your votes.

127
00:09:11,097 --> 00:09:15,761
And your dedication and hard
work will give rise to it.

128
00:09:16,369 --> 00:09:19,270
Then socialism will spread like..

129
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:23,275
..the rays of sun beneath
this blue sky.

130
00:09:44,297 --> 00:09:46,288
Listen! You all please sit down.

131
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:48,129
There is nothing to be afraid of.

132
00:09:48,301 --> 00:09:50,394
No! Please, sit down!

133
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:53,462
Please, sit down! People, calm down.

134
00:09:54,307 --> 00:09:55,467
Run!

135
00:09:55,742 --> 00:09:57,471
Run! Run!

136
00:09:57,644 --> 00:10:00,306
But till where will you run to?

137
00:10:00,413 --> 00:10:03,314
On the peak of Himalayas
our enemies..

138
00:10:03,383 --> 00:10:06,819
..and your own fear has surrounded
you in your home.

139
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,154
Till where will you run to?

140
00:10:09,322 --> 00:10:11,153
Why did you stop? Run!

141
00:10:11,324 --> 00:10:13,155
Who is that man?
- l don't know.

142
00:10:13,226 --> 00:10:15,160
l have never seen him before.

143
00:10:15,228 --> 00:10:17,492
Remember, this fear of yours..

144
00:10:17,563 --> 00:10:20,555
..have made this country
a slave for many years.

145
00:10:21,434 --> 00:10:24,164
Remember, the one who runs
away from sinking ship..

146
00:10:24,237 --> 00:10:27,229
..is not brave enough
to face the waves.

147
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,500
Remember!

148
00:10:29,442 --> 00:10:31,501
You all are sons of that father..

149
00:10:31,577 --> 00:10:34,341
..whose determination
was steady as rock.

150
00:10:35,515 --> 00:10:39,576
You have taken bullets on your
chest without any fear.

151
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,511
Along with Bhagat Singh
you sang the song..

152
00:10:42,588 --> 00:10:44,453
..of freedom and faced death.

153
00:10:45,358 --> 00:10:47,519
And along with Jawaharlal
Nehru you have taken..

154
00:10:47,593 --> 00:10:49,356
..the oath of walking
along with each other.

155
00:10:50,363 --> 00:10:52,593
But why have this fear now?

156
00:10:53,466 --> 00:10:57,596
How can these coward faces
call themselves as lndians?

157
00:10:58,738 --> 00:11:01,138
Dear ones of mother lndia..

158
00:11:01,207 --> 00:11:03,141
..come and stand on the battlefield.

159
00:11:03,343 --> 00:11:06,676
Come and trample all
evil like a storm.

160
00:11:07,413 --> 00:11:11,315
Come and challenge
your enemies that..

161
00:11:11,384 --> 00:11:16,321
..we would rather die
than bow our heads.

162
00:11:39,712 --> 00:11:44,775
We can never loose our freedom.

163
00:11:45,451 --> 00:11:50,514
We can never loose our freedom.

164
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:56,194
We would rather die
than bow our heads.

165
00:11:56,529 --> 00:11:59,191
We won't bow our heads.

166
00:12:02,402 --> 00:12:07,465
We have achieved freedom
after decades of struggle.

167
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,300
We have achieved freedom.

168
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:16,139
We have achieved this wealth
after giving many sacrifices.

169
00:12:16,315 --> 00:12:18,545
We have achieved this wealth.

170
00:12:19,152 --> 00:12:27,321
We have taken bullets
on our chest smilingly.

171
00:12:27,493 --> 00:12:32,487
After going though many ruins
we have achieved this heaven.

172
00:12:32,698 --> 00:12:38,159
We can't destroy our
own reputation.

173
00:12:38,504 --> 00:12:43,339
We can never loose our freedom.

174
00:12:55,521 --> 00:13:00,288
Evil cannot stand against
our firm determination.

175
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,122
Against our firm determination.

176
00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:08,460
No wind can blow this fire away.

177
00:13:08,634 --> 00:13:11,296
Blow this fire away.

178
00:13:11,471 --> 00:13:16,670
May our enemies bring huge
armies against us.

179
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:22,313
May our enemies bring huge
armies against us.

180
00:13:22,682 --> 00:13:27,676
They cannot stand
against our unity.

181
00:13:28,321 --> 00:13:33,315
We are the stone which
the enemy cannot budge.

182
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:38,553
We can never loose our freedom.

183
00:13:39,365 --> 00:13:44,234
We would rather die
than bow our heads.

184
00:13:44,504 --> 00:13:46,836
We won't bow our heads.

185
00:13:58,718 --> 00:14:03,451
We will walk along with time.

186
00:14:03,656 --> 00:14:06,284
Walk along with time.

187
00:14:06,526 --> 00:14:11,463
We will change our own
paths in our lives.

188
00:14:12,131 --> 00:14:14,463
We will change our own paths.

189
00:14:14,734 --> 00:14:20,138
lf we find any traitor
in our dear country..

190
00:14:20,306 --> 00:14:22,740
ln our dear country.

191
00:14:23,142 --> 00:14:28,307
Then we will trample
him with our might.

192
00:14:28,648 --> 00:14:31,139
We have been betrayed once.

193
00:14:31,217 --> 00:14:33,549
We won't be betrayed again.

194
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,223
We can never loose our freedom.

195
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,152
Obeisance to the motherland!

196
00:14:42,762 --> 00:14:44,559
Obeisance to the motherland!

197
00:14:45,565 --> 00:14:47,430
Obeisance to the motherland!

198
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,765
We are the youth of the country.

199
00:14:52,905 --> 00:14:55,567
Those who will fight against us..

200
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:58,336
Those who will fight against us!

201
00:14:58,578 --> 00:15:03,447
He will be completely destroyed
by our strength.

202
00:15:03,716 --> 00:15:06,276
Destroyed by our strength.

203
00:15:06,652 --> 00:15:11,521
All evils will be washed
away in storms of time.

204
00:15:11,724 --> 00:15:17,185
This tricolour will fly
high in the sky forever.

205
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:19,623
ln the sky forever.

206
00:15:20,132 --> 00:15:25,195
We cannot forget the oath
we have taken for you.

207
00:15:25,471 --> 00:15:30,306
We would rather die
than bow our heads.

208
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:35,744
We would rather die
than bow our heads.

209
00:16:00,172 --> 00:16:01,264
Hello, Shallu!

210
00:16:01,507 --> 00:16:04,101
Shallu is not here. l'm his
sister Sunita speaking.

211
00:16:04,176 --> 00:16:05,268
Who is this?

212
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:08,308
l'm editor Vijay Khanna of
the 'Young Day' newspaper.

213
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,108
Greetings, madam! By the way your
younger brothers Shallu..

214
00:16:10,182 --> 00:16:12,116
..works for my party.

215
00:16:12,718 --> 00:16:14,447
To hell with you and your party.

216
00:16:15,454 --> 00:16:17,115
Why you have printed such an
embarrassing picture of mine..

217
00:16:17,189 --> 00:16:18,451
..in your two bits worth newspaper?

218
00:16:18,524 --> 00:16:20,116
What right do you have?

219
00:16:20,192 --> 00:16:22,285
l thought you were a
modern girl, madam.

220
00:16:23,462 --> 00:16:25,293
But it seems that you
are very orthodox.

221
00:16:25,398 --> 00:16:27,127
And when you came to the meeting..

222
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,292
..then it was just terrific.

223
00:16:30,136 --> 00:16:33,128
ln the talks of votes, people
go crazy looking at you.

224
00:16:33,806 --> 00:16:35,467
You call yourself a journalist?

225
00:16:36,409 --> 00:16:37,671
You don't have the manners
to talks to a decent girl.

226
00:16:37,743 --> 00:16:40,143
And you dream to be a leader.

227
00:16:40,346 --> 00:16:42,473
You must know that everyone
is after leaders these days.

228
00:16:42,548 --> 00:16:44,140
That everyone is after everyone.

229
00:16:44,216 --> 00:16:46,150
That means there is someone
behind your success too.

230
00:16:46,218 --> 00:16:48,209
That's why l have chosen
you, Ms. Sunita.

231
00:16:48,421 --> 00:16:51,151
You can dig for grass for your
entire life, Mr. Khanna.

232
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:53,549
Will you dig with
me too, Ms. Sunita?

233
00:16:54,427 --> 00:16:56,622
Bloody idiot! Don't you
dare take my name.

234
00:16:56,696 --> 00:16:58,220
l hate you very much.

235
00:16:58,331 --> 00:17:00,265
Thank you, Ms. Sunita.

236
00:17:00,499 --> 00:17:02,490
This hatred is the
first sign of love.

237
00:17:02,568 --> 00:17:04,263
And you have taken the
first step in love.

238
00:17:04,337 --> 00:17:06,430
Now you just a watch,
l'll be behind you.

239
00:17:06,505 --> 00:17:08,097
You will be in front of me.

240
00:17:08,274 --> 00:17:10,504
From Bombay to Agra.

241
00:17:10,576 --> 00:17:13,443
Then definitely visit
the asylum there.

242
00:17:14,447 --> 00:17:18,281
lf you know that there is also
a Taj Mahal made for lovers.

243
00:17:19,285 --> 00:17:20,650
What we'll do is fight
the election of love..

244
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,278
..in a exotic night, over there.

245
00:17:22,355 --> 00:17:24,516
l will vote for you
and you vote for me.

246
00:17:25,124 --> 00:17:26,455
l will vote for you?

247
00:17:26,592 --> 00:17:28,116
Conceded idiot!

248
00:17:32,398 --> 00:17:35,299
We hold hands in the exotic
night together.

249
00:17:35,401 --> 00:17:39,132
You are his professor.
He is from your class.

250
00:17:39,205 --> 00:17:41,298
He is your student. He is your son.

251
00:17:41,407 --> 00:17:43,534
l'm looking for him since five days.

252
00:17:43,642 --> 00:17:45,132
But l couldn't find him.

253
00:17:45,311 --> 00:17:48,144
And in the class, sometimes he
is there and sometimes not.

254
00:17:48,214 --> 00:17:50,307
And in the house, your
mother and your wife..

255
00:17:50,383 --> 00:17:52,317
..both have joined his team.

256
00:17:53,419 --> 00:17:56,149
lf the thief is the dear
one of the family..

257
00:17:56,222 --> 00:17:58,554
..then who can catch him?
- l will catch him.

258
00:17:58,691 --> 00:18:01,159
l will drag him here in
front of you right now.

259
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,354
Either you explain him or l
will spank him up for good.

260
00:18:05,264 --> 00:18:06,356
Call him.

261
00:18:06,432 --> 00:18:08,093
Vijay!

262
00:18:08,267 --> 00:18:10,497
Vijay, father is calling you.
Come down, right now.

263
00:18:10,636 --> 00:18:12,103

264
00:18:15,641 --> 00:18:17,108
Coming!

265
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,109
Hello!

266
00:18:19,178 --> 00:18:20,270
Hello, yes.

267
00:18:20,346 --> 00:18:22,109
Yes, Trombay fire station.

268
00:18:22,448 --> 00:18:25,281
What? There is a fire
in Thadda company?

269
00:18:25,451 --> 00:18:26,577
There is a fire in Thadda
company, brother!

270
00:18:26,652 --> 00:18:28,119
There is a fire in Thadda company?

271
00:18:28,187 --> 00:18:30,121
Yes! Yes, Mr. Fernandez.

272
00:18:30,189 --> 00:18:32,282
Mr. Fernandez is calling you,
brother. lmmediately!

273
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:33,652
Yes, Mr. Fernandez, l have told him.

274
00:18:33,726 --> 00:18:35,523
What? Lal Baugh No.3.

275
00:18:35,628 --> 00:18:37,721
Lal Baugh No.3!
- Yes, Mr. Fernandez.

276
00:18:37,797 --> 00:18:40,288
Yes, he is coming. He is gone!

277
00:18:42,401 --> 00:18:44,596
He is gone, Mr. Fernandez.

278
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:51,134
Brother, your helmet!

279
00:18:52,411 --> 00:18:54,140
Brother, your helmet!

280
00:18:55,314 --> 00:18:56,747
What kind of job is this?

281
00:18:56,816 --> 00:18:58,681
You don't care about food or water.

282
00:18:58,751 --> 00:19:00,343
Just blow out fires
all day and night.

283
00:19:00,486 --> 00:19:02,147
lt was not a fight but it was trick.

284
00:19:02,621 --> 00:19:04,612
And it was played by your son Vijay.

285
00:19:05,591 --> 00:19:07,491
You are after him day and night..

286
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,089
..as if he is not your son.

287
00:19:10,162 --> 00:19:12,426
No! After a great thought
l have concluded..

288
00:19:12,498 --> 00:19:14,489
..that he is not my son.

289
00:19:15,701 --> 00:19:17,100
He is my father!

290
00:19:19,171 --> 00:19:21,264
l'm late for college.
- Wear you coat. - Give it.

291
00:19:24,376 --> 00:19:26,105
Give me my glasses.

292
00:19:26,178 --> 00:19:28,112
What is this?

293
00:19:29,448 --> 00:19:31,109
What a professor!

294
00:19:35,521 --> 00:19:38,285
An eye for an eye! lt's
not just an old saying.

295
00:19:39,325 --> 00:19:41,623
But it's the oldest principle
that a human being follows.

296
00:19:42,595 --> 00:19:49,728
Section 299 and 302 are kept
one the basis of lPC.

297
00:19:50,469 --> 00:19:53,131
That's why murder committed
in complete senses..

298
00:19:53,205 --> 00:19:55,469
..is capitalized by death sentence.

299
00:19:56,141 --> 00:19:58,132
Sir!
- What is it?

300
00:19:58,744 --> 00:20:01,144
Sir, the philosophers of
the 20th century say..

301
00:20:01,213 --> 00:20:03,477
..that the saying eye for an eye..

302
00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:05,483
..is not the principle
of a human but animals.

303
00:20:06,151 --> 00:20:10,212
Sir, they say that it's a
black spot on the society.

304
00:20:10,556 --> 00:20:13,684
Vijay Khanna, first clear your
stains of your newspaper.

305
00:20:13,826 --> 00:20:15,623
Then you can complaint
against the law.

306
00:20:15,694 --> 00:20:17,161
Sir, you know the law properly.

307
00:20:17,229 --> 00:20:19,561
lf you turn it this way
then it turns this way.

308
00:20:19,665 --> 00:20:21,565
lf you turn it that way
then it turns that way.

309
00:20:22,334 --> 00:20:25,167
So you consider law to be the
brinjal kept on a plate.

310
00:20:25,337 --> 00:20:28,170
Sir, brinjal is for eating. Even
l had brinjal at breakfast.

311
00:20:28,774 --> 00:20:30,332
Shut up!
- l'm sorry, sir.

312
00:20:30,509 --> 00:20:32,500
Sit down.
- Thank you, sir.

313
00:20:36,582 --> 00:20:40,245
Get up!
- Yes, sir.

314
00:20:40,586 --> 00:20:42,679
Get out!
- Yes, sir.

315
00:20:49,728 --> 00:20:52,526
Just listen, you call us
whenever you need us.

316
00:20:52,598 --> 00:20:53,860
And for us you are
being so stubborn.

317
00:20:53,933 --> 00:20:55,662
And bother, Vijay,
don't forget that..

318
00:20:55,734 --> 00:20:57,668
..we all have chosen you our leader.

319
00:20:57,736 --> 00:21:00,796
And our hands are scarred clapping
for you in the election.

320
00:21:00,873 --> 00:21:03,137
And our throats have gone
dry chanting your name.

321
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:05,642
And when you did this we have
always chanted with you.

322
00:21:05,711 --> 00:21:07,645
And when you did this we
have applauded for you.

323
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,144
That is all fine, boys. But..

324
00:21:10,316 --> 00:21:11,544
We don't care about ifs and buts.

325
00:21:11,617 --> 00:21:12,743
You have to be the referee!

326
00:21:12,818 --> 00:21:15,218
Yes, you will have to be!
- Yes, you will have to be!

327
00:21:16,422 --> 00:21:18,151
Fine, l'll be.

328
00:21:25,331 --> 00:21:28,630
This referee is a cheat!

329
00:21:29,568 --> 00:21:31,160
He is playing himself.

330
00:21:33,505 --> 00:21:35,166
Foul!

331
00:21:37,843 --> 00:21:40,175
He is with the guest team.

332
00:21:40,245 --> 00:21:42,179
Throw him out.

333
00:21:48,354 --> 00:21:50,254
Throw him out!

334
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,349
Don't any dare touch me.

335
00:21:54,526 --> 00:21:55,788
This hooliganism cannot work.

336
00:21:55,861 --> 00:21:57,192
You are a cheat!

337
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,789
You dare to hit the
referee with a shoe?

338
00:22:00,199 --> 00:22:02,463
You now that l'm the commander
of this ground.

339
00:22:02,635 --> 00:22:05,468
My position is here like that
of the judge in a court.

340
00:22:05,537 --> 00:22:06,663
My decision cannot be changed.

341
00:22:06,739 --> 00:22:08,138
You all are out.

342
00:22:11,744 --> 00:22:14,406
Have patience! Calm down,
brothers. Relax!

343
00:22:14,713 --> 00:22:17,147
Look, in a country of non-violence..

344
00:22:17,216 --> 00:22:20,151
..if you us the act of violence
with shoes and beating then..

345
00:22:20,219 --> 00:22:22,551
..the position f this country
will completely deteriorate.

346
00:22:22,688 --> 00:22:25,156
lt will be worth 2 bits!
People will spit on us.

347
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:29,550
Look, l'm like a leader for you.

348
00:22:29,695 --> 00:22:32,425
l'm the commander of this ground.
l'm your leader.

349
00:22:32,498 --> 00:22:35,695
You can cover up my little
frauds. Forget it!

350
00:22:35,768 --> 00:22:37,167
Be merciful.

351
00:22:55,788 --> 00:22:57,346
lt's 1 2 o'clock.

352
00:22:57,523 --> 00:22:59,184
But your prince has not arrived yet.

353
00:22:59,725 --> 00:23:01,659
His cycle must have got puncture.

354
00:23:02,528 --> 00:23:04,291
He will be here. Forget it.

355
00:23:04,463 --> 00:23:06,397
You keep quiet!
- You are right, father.

356
00:23:06,465 --> 00:23:09,298
Today you should give
some firm decision.

357
00:23:09,535 --> 00:23:11,400
Tomorrow he will be engaged.

358
00:23:11,537 --> 00:23:14,131
Anyways, l have fixed the
date of the marriage too.

359
00:23:15,307 --> 00:23:17,138
Come in, sir.

360
00:23:19,311 --> 00:23:22,144
He is Mr. Kesari Das.

361
00:23:22,414 --> 00:23:25,144
He is a retired officer
from the forest department.

362
00:23:25,417 --> 00:23:27,146
He is my son's father-in-law.

363
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:29,310
Pleased to meet you.
- Me too. - Have a seat.

364
00:23:33,325 --> 00:23:35,156
Where's the groom?

365
00:23:47,573 --> 00:23:49,768
Meet him. He is Mr. Kesari Das.

366
00:23:50,242 --> 00:23:52,176
Your, future father-in-law.

367
00:23:52,711 --> 00:23:54,178
Bow to him.

368
00:23:54,513 --> 00:23:56,174
Son, bow to him!

369
00:23:56,248 --> 00:23:58,443
lt doesn't matter. You
are like my father.

370
00:23:59,351 --> 00:24:01,114
Greetings!
- Greetings!

371
00:24:01,186 --> 00:24:03,120
Come, sit.

372
00:24:04,523 --> 00:24:06,115
Your son is very shy.
- Shy?

373
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:09,590
He is sharp man. He
is a great actor.

374
00:24:09,661 --> 00:24:11,185
He is great public speaker.

375
00:24:11,263 --> 00:24:12,594
So priest, why are taking so long?

376
00:24:12,664 --> 00:24:14,461
Where is the necklace?
- Where is the ring?

377
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,292
lf you don't mind then l have to
say something in this matter.

378
00:24:18,403 --> 00:24:21,133
There is nothing to say. This
is not the moment for a speech.

379
00:24:21,206 --> 00:24:23,401
Not a speech! Just a small
misunderstanding.

380
00:24:23,542 --> 00:24:26,136
lt's not that serious. lt's
a matter of marriage.

381
00:24:26,211 --> 00:24:28,145
lt's not easy as having
a cup of tea.

382
00:24:28,313 --> 00:24:29,610
Or have some snacks.

383
00:24:29,681 --> 00:24:32,206
Sir, you should carefully
see the boy in this matter.

384
00:24:32,551 --> 00:24:35,315
How deep are his emotions!
How high are his aims!

385
00:24:35,387 --> 00:24:38,550
His habits, his bad doings.
What is he?

386
00:24:38,624 --> 00:24:43,152
You should carefully check
his mental level.

387
00:24:43,328 --> 00:24:45,228
Do you know the condition
of our country?

388
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:47,161
A baby is born every second here.

389
00:24:47,332 --> 00:24:49,163
The population is ever increasing.

390
00:24:49,334 --> 00:24:51,234
And you can't get
anything cheap now.

391
00:24:51,336 --> 00:24:55,500
And the prices of all necessary
things are rising high.

392
00:24:55,574 --> 00:24:57,337
And what is happening in
this country these days.

393
00:24:57,509 --> 00:25:00,171
Only strikes!

394
00:25:00,445 --> 00:25:02,640
You are just looking at
the one face of the coin.

395
00:25:02,714 --> 00:25:06,115
Uncle Faqruddin, look at the
other face of the coin too.

396
00:25:06,185 --> 00:25:08,119
You should look at both
sides carefully.

397
00:25:08,287 --> 00:25:10,278
lt means this a free country.

398
00:25:10,455 --> 00:25:13,288
And every man has the right
to speak for himself.

399
00:25:13,458 --> 00:25:16,723
What is this happening?
Sister-in-law!

400
00:25:16,795 --> 00:25:18,592
Look, everyone listen
to me carefully.

401
00:25:18,664 --> 00:25:20,325
l'm not getting married.

402
00:25:21,466 --> 00:25:24,299
l will disguise myself as a
sage and from this office..

403
00:25:24,369 --> 00:25:28,135
..l will leave to wander
in a jungle or forest..

404
00:25:28,207 --> 00:25:31,301
..or wander in the entire lndia.
This is all wrong!

405
00:25:31,476 --> 00:25:35,139
The state of our country
is getting worse.

406
00:25:35,214 --> 00:25:38,308
People are getting married
and making babies..

407
00:25:38,383 --> 00:25:39,680
You are right!

408
00:25:39,751 --> 00:25:41,616
Even we won't marry!
- Correct!

409
00:25:41,687 --> 00:25:43,552
We will go along with you too!

410
00:25:44,489 --> 00:25:46,684
Absolutely! The calf goes
where the cow goes.

411
00:25:46,758 --> 00:25:50,319
You bloody calves! Am l your mother?

412
00:25:50,495 --> 00:25:51,621
We don't care if you
are mother or aunty.

413
00:25:51,697 --> 00:25:53,164
We will go along with you.

414
00:25:53,432 --> 00:25:57,562
You will get yourself killed
and get me killed too.

415
00:25:57,669 --> 00:26:00,570
All of your parents
will come after me.

416
00:26:00,639 --> 00:26:03,267
They lodge a report against
me and l will be arrested.

417
00:26:03,342 --> 00:26:05,105
And you will all live comfortably
at your home.

418
00:26:05,277 --> 00:26:08,110
No! We will come too!

419
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,273
We will come too!

420
00:26:14,653 --> 00:26:18,282
Hello. Yes! Vijay Khanna
took your son?

421
00:26:18,457 --> 00:26:21,119
l just got the news that
the editor Vijay Khanna..

422
00:26:21,193 --> 00:26:24,128
lnspector sir, my son has left home.

423
00:26:24,296 --> 00:26:27,129
l have lost my sleep and my
appetite too. Search him out.

424
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:31,531
lnspector sir, l have heard that

425
00:26:32,304 --> 00:26:36,297
Hello! Yes! That Vijay Khanna
has kidnapped my son.

426
00:26:36,475 --> 00:26:38,409
His husband's heart has failed.

427
00:26:52,491 --> 00:26:54,152
Police?

428
00:26:56,762 --> 00:26:59,697
Greetings, inspector sir!
- Greetings!

429
00:27:00,699 --> 00:27:04,157
Listen.. can you hear me?

430
00:27:04,369 --> 00:27:06,098
Yes, l can hear you.

431
00:27:06,305 --> 00:27:08,637
Who are you waiting for?

432
00:27:09,274 --> 00:27:12,437
l'm waiting for you only.
Please come.

433
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,440
lnspector sir!

434
00:27:17,449 --> 00:27:21,442
We have some difficulties!
Difficulty!

435
00:27:23,288 --> 00:27:26,121
We will take care of that.
Just come here.

436
00:27:29,728 --> 00:27:33,129
lnspector sir! lf we
don't come there..

437
00:27:33,198 --> 00:27:37,464
..then what will happen?

438
00:27:37,636 --> 00:27:39,661
lf you don't come then
it will be very bad.

439
00:27:39,738 --> 00:27:42,536
You will be arrested!
- Then?

440
00:27:43,675 --> 00:27:47,304
You will be imprisoned! Then you
will have to grind the flour.

441
00:27:47,546 --> 00:27:49,138
Flour!

442
00:27:51,316 --> 00:27:52,749
They will not obey this way.

443
00:27:52,818 --> 00:27:54,217
C'mon, catch them!

444
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,149
Run!

445
00:28:06,698 --> 00:28:09,428
We have been informed by our
district police that..

446
00:28:09,501 --> 00:28:12,766
..they have been seen near
this police station.

447
00:28:12,838 --> 00:28:14,499
Did they catch them?

448
00:28:14,606 --> 00:28:17,097
No! They jumped into
the river Narmada.

449
00:28:17,309 --> 00:28:19,777
What? River Narmada?
- River Narmada?

450
00:28:19,845 --> 00:28:22,109
Yes! But what was astonishing that..

451
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:25,115
..when the police reached
at the shore of the river..

452
00:28:25,183 --> 00:28:26,445
..then the boys were not there.
- Oh God!

453
00:28:26,518 --> 00:28:29,282
Did you hear that? The boys
jumped in the river.

454
00:28:29,454 --> 00:28:31,388
But didn't cross it.
- Oh no!

455
00:28:31,523 --> 00:28:33,650
Oh God! Please protect
these children.

456
00:28:33,725 --> 00:28:35,454
You keep praying here to God.

457
00:28:36,395 --> 00:28:38,124
And l will search for
my brother myself.

458
00:28:38,196 --> 00:28:40,130
Good bye, DSP sir.

459
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,459
She is right. She is
absolutely right.

460
00:28:43,535 --> 00:28:45,127
Let's go.
- Just wait..

461
00:28:47,873 --> 00:28:52,139
All hail the revolution!

462
00:28:56,314 --> 00:28:57,406
Brother, we are busted.

463
00:28:57,482 --> 00:29:00,246
Don't be scared. Come with me.

464
00:29:01,253 --> 00:29:03,084
All hail the revolution!

465
00:29:03,155 --> 00:29:05,248
All hail the revolution!

466
00:29:30,282 --> 00:29:32,773
l agree that our country has
been separated in to states.

467
00:29:33,185 --> 00:29:37,121
But l'm asking is why didn't
we get our share of our land.

468
00:29:37,656 --> 00:29:40,284
And did you see, how the
neighbouring state..

469
00:29:40,358 --> 00:29:43,122
..took the Jagdamba mountain and..

470
00:29:43,195 --> 00:29:46,631
..the Dharmaputra river
in it's boundaries.

471
00:29:46,698 --> 00:29:50,293
And our great leader Mr.
Acharya said..

472
00:29:50,368 --> 00:29:54,134
..that this is not treachery
but a great thing.

473
00:29:54,206 --> 00:29:56,333
Down with Mr. Acharya!

474
00:29:56,541 --> 00:29:59,135
Down with Mr. Acharya!

475
00:29:59,478 --> 00:30:02,140
Long live Mr. Anupam!

476
00:30:02,214 --> 00:30:04,148
Long live Mr. Anupam!

477
00:30:04,616 --> 00:30:06,675
And that's why l'm
telling you that..

478
00:30:06,751 --> 00:30:09,413
..vote for our party for
the coming elections.

479
00:30:09,554 --> 00:30:12,148
Because..
- He is right! - He is right!

480
00:30:13,325 --> 00:30:15,316
Because..
- He is right!

481
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,162
Because our party
has taken an oath..

482
00:30:24,236 --> 00:30:26,170
..that after winning the elections..

483
00:30:26,238 --> 00:30:28,331
..we will capture both Jagdamba
and Dharmaputra.

484
00:30:28,573 --> 00:30:30,507
Bravo!
- Bravo!

485
00:30:39,351 --> 00:30:41,182
lf a Punjabi can fight for Punjab..

486
00:30:41,253 --> 00:30:43,187
..a Bengali can fight for Bengal..

487
00:30:43,255 --> 00:30:45,189
..and Madrasi can fight for Madras..

488
00:30:45,257 --> 00:30:48,590
..then even we can sacrifice our
lives for out state. - Great!

489
00:30:50,362 --> 00:30:53,195
Let us in.
- You can't go.

490
00:30:53,265 --> 00:30:55,597
We have to go in!
- You can't go.

491
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,537
All hail the revolution!

492
00:31:03,642 --> 00:31:05,473
All hail the revolution!

493
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:07,407
All hail the revolution!

494
00:31:11,316 --> 00:31:13,682
Dharmaputra river..
- ls ours!

495
00:31:14,219 --> 00:31:16,483
Jagdamba mountain..
- ls ours!

496
00:31:16,688 --> 00:31:18,155
Wait!

497
00:31:20,492 --> 00:31:22,153
Brothers and..

498
00:31:23,361 --> 00:31:25,488
Brothers and sisters!

499
00:31:26,498 --> 00:31:28,557
This is a very unusual opportunity.

500
00:31:29,501 --> 00:31:32,334
And before we take any
action in haste..

501
00:31:32,404 --> 00:31:35,339
..we should think over our paths..

502
00:31:35,407 --> 00:31:39,173
..the turns in our paths,
the passing time..

503
00:31:39,244 --> 00:31:44,238
..and the admirable
hopes and thoughts.

504
00:31:44,316 --> 00:31:49,185
Yes, you are right!

505
00:31:49,354 --> 00:31:53,188
First of all, brothers,
we have to silent those..

506
00:31:53,258 --> 00:31:57,354
..who are interrupting
our meeting there.

507
00:31:57,529 --> 00:31:59,656
Let me in, or else l'll
call the police.

508
00:31:59,731 --> 00:32:03,531
Silence! Now we should have
this meeting peacefully.

509
00:32:03,668 --> 00:32:06,728
Where current times are taking us.

510
00:32:08,473 --> 00:32:12,307
A country like China
is slowly stealing..

511
00:32:12,377 --> 00:32:17,144
..all the fame and fortune
from our country.

512
00:32:18,483 --> 00:32:23,147
And we are still debating here
for the river Dharmaputra.

513
00:32:24,155 --> 00:32:26,487
Rockets of Russia and
America are revolting..

514
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:28,685
..around the moon and the sun.

515
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,489
Around the moon and the sun!

516
00:32:30,562 --> 00:32:32,496
And here we are still
fighting over..

517
00:32:32,564 --> 00:32:34,691
..the rights of the
mountain Jagdamba.

518
00:32:37,335 --> 00:32:39,496
There they are making
genius inventions.

519
00:32:39,704 --> 00:32:44,641
And here we are banging our
heads on temples and mosques.

520
00:32:45,343 --> 00:32:47,504
Tell me is this right?

521
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,169
Absolutely not!

522
00:32:49,581 --> 00:32:52,846
Then should we listen to
such trash politicians?

523
00:32:53,351 --> 00:32:55,182
Never!

524
00:32:55,253 --> 00:32:57,244
Will they help in the progress
of our country?

525
00:32:57,455 --> 00:32:59,184
Never!

526
00:32:59,357 --> 00:33:01,257
Will they help in the progress
of our country?

527
00:33:01,326 --> 00:33:03,294
Never!

528
00:33:03,662 --> 00:33:05,129
Are they our friends?

529
00:33:05,196 --> 00:33:07,289
They are our enemies!

530
00:33:07,365 --> 00:33:09,128
Look at them!

531
00:33:11,202 --> 00:33:13,397
Hit them!

532
00:33:13,471 --> 00:33:14,529
Please everyone sit down!

533
00:33:14,606 --> 00:33:16,301
Please calm down..
- Hit them!

534
00:33:22,747 --> 00:33:25,307
Please listen..
- Hit them!

535
00:33:47,706 --> 00:33:51,164
Who are you?
- Forgive me.

536
00:33:51,576 --> 00:33:53,567
Forgive me for sitting in your
car without permission.

537
00:33:53,645 --> 00:33:55,169
l apologize for it.
- You?

538
00:33:55,513 --> 00:33:57,344
l have seen you somewhere before.

539
00:33:57,515 --> 00:33:59,244
Your face seems so familiar.

540
00:34:00,452 --> 00:34:02,113
Weren't you giving the lecture
in this meeting?

541
00:34:02,187 --> 00:34:04,519
Yes, it was me! l was
that unfortunate one.

542
00:34:04,622 --> 00:34:07,113
But did you see the result
of speaking the truth?

543
00:34:07,325 --> 00:34:09,293
The planets are not in their
proper constellations.

544
00:34:09,394 --> 00:34:11,123
And they are causing such bad luck..

545
00:34:11,196 --> 00:34:13,460
..as a result this country
is in complete chaos.

546
00:34:13,531 --> 00:34:16,466
And if you tell someone the
truth then he will bite you.

547
00:34:17,669 --> 00:34:19,330
Did you buy this car?

548
00:34:20,472 --> 00:34:21,530
What did you say?

549
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:24,472
Are you saying that l'm deaf?
- l never said that.

550
00:34:24,743 --> 00:34:26,802
Then you could have narrated
your story from behind.

551
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:28,539
Why did you come in the front?

552
00:34:29,414 --> 00:34:31,473
Look, madam, do you think
l am some kind of..

553
00:34:31,549 --> 00:34:34,313
..a low level, good for nothing,
worthless, loafer?

554
00:34:34,486 --> 00:34:36,545
Or else are you a father
of some church?

555
00:34:36,654 --> 00:34:38,212
Look, l'm warning you.

556
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,754
You are insulting a respected
and well known man.

557
00:34:41,426 --> 00:34:43,155
And you very well know that
l hid in your car..

558
00:34:43,228 --> 00:34:45,162
..just to save myself.

559
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,164
And l also apologized for it.

560
00:34:47,332 --> 00:34:49,163
But it's not your fault.

561
00:34:49,434 --> 00:34:53,564
lf revolution is written in
your faith then it happens.

562
00:34:53,638 --> 00:34:55,162
To hell with whatever happens?

563
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,332
Get out of my car!

564
00:34:56,574 --> 00:34:58,166
What did you say?
- Out!

565
00:34:58,443 --> 00:35:02,106
l'm going! But remember you may
search for your entire life.

566
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,114
But you won't find him.

567
00:35:05,116 --> 00:35:06,447
Whom will l not find?

568
00:35:06,518 --> 00:35:08,110
The one whom you are searching for..

569
00:35:08,186 --> 00:35:10,586
..in every jungle and city.
You will not find him.

570
00:35:10,722 --> 00:35:12,519
Listen! Listen!

571
00:35:13,391 --> 00:35:15,450
Listen!
- Yes? - How did you now?

572
00:35:15,627 --> 00:35:17,458
l have been an astrological
student for 1 1 years for..

573
00:35:17,529 --> 00:35:20,123
..the great astrologer Swami
Venkatram from Trivandrum.

574
00:35:20,298 --> 00:35:22,391
lf my prediction is wrong
then l'll behead myself.

575
00:35:24,669 --> 00:35:26,193
You are absolutely right.

576
00:35:26,404 --> 00:35:28,304
l was searching for my
younger brother Shallu.

577
00:35:28,473 --> 00:35:31,306
One hooligan provoked
him and took him along.

578
00:35:31,543 --> 00:35:34,205
And today l even saw
him in the meeting.

579
00:35:34,412 --> 00:35:37,142
And everything went
wrong in the meeting.

580
00:35:37,315 --> 00:35:39,283
Forgive me, l misjudged you.

581
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:40,681
No! You judged me correctly.

582
00:35:40,752 --> 00:35:42,549
l'm a father of some church.

583
00:35:43,688 --> 00:35:45,155
Goodbye!

584
00:35:46,558 --> 00:35:49,550
Listen! l'm feeling ashamed.
Please, forgive me.

585
00:35:49,694 --> 00:35:51,491
And tell me where l can find him.

586
00:35:51,563 --> 00:35:54,760
Tell me, please..
- Move this right hand. Move it.

587
00:35:54,833 --> 00:35:56,164
Show me your left hand.

588
00:36:05,109 --> 00:36:07,373
Name of the kid?
- Kumar Shailender.

589
00:36:07,512 --> 00:36:09,309
What?
- Kumar Shailender.

590
00:36:09,447 --> 00:36:11,312
With love we call him Shallu.

591
00:36:11,449 --> 00:36:14,111
With love?
- Yes, with love.

592
00:36:17,655 --> 00:36:20,647
He must be about 9-10 years old.
- Yes.

593
00:36:21,392 --> 00:36:23,587
And he must be fair in
colour like you. - Yes.

594
00:36:23,661 --> 00:36:25,128
He is fair.
- Very fair.

595
00:36:25,196 --> 00:36:27,596
And beneath his left eye
there is a beauty spot.

596
00:36:27,665 --> 00:36:29,292
No, under his right eye.

597
00:36:29,534 --> 00:36:31,126
On that side?
- Yes.

598
00:36:33,538 --> 00:36:35,130
There are only 15 minutes
left before the planets..

599
00:36:35,206 --> 00:36:37,140
..change their positions.
Maybe we'll find him.

600
00:36:37,542 --> 00:36:39,134
Come with me.

601
00:36:40,311 --> 00:36:42,302
My car is there!
- Yes, let's go.

602
00:36:45,483 --> 00:36:47,144
Waiter!

603
00:36:50,688 --> 00:36:52,155
Keys!

604
00:36:56,694 --> 00:37:00,630
They all seem to be victims
of that Vijay Khanna.

605
00:37:01,366 --> 00:37:04,096
Yes. Look, that imbecile has
troubled everyone so much.

606
00:37:04,269 --> 00:37:07,102
Rascal! Worthless! Hooligan!

607
00:37:08,273 --> 00:37:11,106
He is such a bastard and a con too.

608
00:37:13,444 --> 00:37:15,105
Listen..

609
00:37:16,648 --> 00:37:18,115
He wants to tell you something.

610
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:22,442
Ms. Sunita, just a minute.

611
00:37:23,388 --> 00:37:25,117
He is the same person
who was giving..

612
00:37:25,189 --> 00:37:27,123
..that great speech in the morning.

613
00:37:27,725 --> 00:37:30,319
Yes! He is also great astrologer.

614
00:37:30,662 --> 00:37:33,130
He told everything about
the boys to me.

615
00:37:33,331 --> 00:37:37,597
Even Shallu's hair colour,
his height, his age..

616
00:37:37,669 --> 00:37:39,136
Bless him!

617
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:41,461
But what does he predict
for the future?

618
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:44,665
Please tell us, sir. We
are in deep trouble.

619
00:37:48,413 --> 00:37:50,472
You should wipe your face
from those worries..

620
00:37:50,548 --> 00:37:52,812
..and be happy.

621
00:37:54,752 --> 00:37:56,151
Be happy.

622
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:03,753
Right now the planets are coming
in the right positions.

623
00:38:04,762 --> 00:38:09,495
Now they are watching
each other carefully.

624
00:38:10,435 --> 00:38:13,768
They are watching each
other carefully.

625
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:17,105
That's why on the seventh of
this month when the sunsets..

626
00:38:17,175 --> 00:38:21,111
..that means in the evening, in
the Water palace of Udaypur..

627
00:38:21,179 --> 00:38:24,273
..in the Water palace of Udaypur..

628
00:38:24,349 --> 00:38:27,648
..you will find your dear children.

629
00:38:30,388 --> 00:38:33,289
Remember that this is
the same Water palace..

630
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:36,293
..where 225 years ago
Emperor Shahjahan..

631
00:38:36,361 --> 00:38:39,296
..ordered to fill the lake
with saffron and scent..

632
00:38:39,364 --> 00:38:42,458
..and bathed with her queen.

633
00:38:43,401 --> 00:38:45,460
And it's written in history
that the Queen..

634
00:38:45,536 --> 00:38:47,401
..was wearing a pink
gown at that moment.

635
00:38:47,538 --> 00:38:53,477
And water was dripping from
her beautiful wet hair.

636
00:38:53,745 --> 00:38:57,476
And even the moon was feeling
shy of her gloom.

637
00:38:58,549 --> 00:39:01,347
The queen had complete faith
in Shahjahan's love.

638
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,081
But she was silent.

639
00:39:04,622 --> 00:39:09,252
Then both of them were
holding hands..

640
00:39:09,327 --> 00:39:14,697
..and they started walking
on the banks of the river.

641
00:39:15,566 --> 00:39:18,501
And seeing them walk the
stars started to glimmer.

642
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:21,500
Even the moon hid behind the clouds.

643
00:39:22,373 --> 00:39:24,273
And the queen was smiling
just like this.

644
00:39:24,442 --> 00:39:26,637
And smiling like this
she bowed her head.

645
00:39:27,111 --> 00:39:32,174
And looking at this Shahjahan
slowly closed his eyes.

646
00:39:32,517 --> 00:39:35,645
He kept hands on the
queen's shoulder.

647
00:39:36,287 --> 00:39:40,121
And slowly.. slowly.. slowly..

648
00:39:40,191 --> 00:39:44,651
..he was lost in her dreams.

649
00:39:45,663 --> 00:39:47,460
Wonderful!

650
00:39:47,632 --> 00:39:50,533
Sir, you have given a great show.

651
00:39:50,668 --> 00:39:53,660
ln the name of astrology
you showed us poetry.

652
00:39:54,305 --> 00:39:56,136
Great!
- Bravo!

653
00:39:56,307 --> 00:39:58,138
Excellent!
- Wonderful!

654
00:39:58,209 --> 00:40:00,143
Enough! l told you that
l will meet you in..

655
00:40:00,211 --> 00:40:02,406
..the lnternational hotel. Now
you should leave from here.

656
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,640
We will meet.

657
00:40:03,715 --> 00:40:05,307
Brother Vijay, you should
meet us in Taj Mahal.

658
00:40:05,483 --> 00:40:07,474
l have told you a hundred times..

659
00:40:07,552 --> 00:40:09,315
..l will meet you at
Taj Mahal. Now go.

660
00:40:09,487 --> 00:40:11,352
C'mon, let's go.
- Let's go.

661
00:40:12,423 --> 00:40:14,823
Definitely come there.

662
00:40:16,327 --> 00:40:18,693
We will wait for you there.
- Do come.

663
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:28,170
Hello! Who is this?

664
00:40:28,439 --> 00:40:30,566
l'm single like you, Ms. Sunita.

665
00:40:30,708 --> 00:40:33,438
l'm roaming around but no
one is ready to accept me

666
00:40:33,511 --> 00:40:35,342
What do you mean? Rascal!

667
00:40:35,446 --> 00:40:37,175
lf you have the guts then
just tell me your name.

668
00:40:37,248 --> 00:40:38,340
Then you will see what happens.

669
00:40:38,516 --> 00:40:40,507
My name is Vijay Khanna.

670
00:40:41,452 --> 00:40:43,716
You are that monster! Bastard!

671
00:40:44,355 --> 00:40:46,186
Tell me where Shallu is.

672
00:40:47,525 --> 00:40:49,459
That brat is always
worried about you.

673
00:40:50,528 --> 00:40:52,189
He repeats again and again..

674
00:40:52,263 --> 00:40:53,662
..friends, my sister has grown up.

675
00:40:53,731 --> 00:40:55,255
Let me know of some marriage
proposal for her.

676
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,464
What else could l do? l
offered myself to him.

677
00:40:59,537 --> 00:41:01,129
Shut up! You fool!

678
00:41:01,539 --> 00:41:03,530
lf you say then l'll
disconnect the call.

679
00:41:03,674 --> 00:41:05,539
What will you do? l'll
disconnect it myself.

680
00:41:05,643 --> 00:41:09,135
Ruffian! Hooligan! Dog!
Third class person!

681
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,141
Who was it, Ms. Sunita?

682
00:41:11,215 --> 00:41:13,308
That same man.. Vijay Khanna. ldiot!

683
00:41:15,686 --> 00:41:17,153
Hello! Hello!

684
00:41:18,489 --> 00:41:20,616
He is still there.
What are you doing?

685
00:41:20,691 --> 00:41:22,625
Keep this fraud busy on the line.

686
00:41:22,693 --> 00:41:24,490
l will call the police right away.

687
00:41:24,562 --> 00:41:25,620
Go fast!
- l'll go now!

688
00:41:25,696 --> 00:41:27,163
Good idea!

689
00:41:28,332 --> 00:41:30,163
Hello!
- Hello!

690
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:35,505
Forgive me, Mr. Vijay Khanna.

691
00:41:36,574 --> 00:41:38,166
How are you?

692
00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:43,342
What a sweet voice!

693
00:41:43,781 --> 00:41:46,181
l swear even a beggar
will turn into a king..

694
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:48,343
..after hearing your voice.

695
00:41:51,722 --> 00:41:53,189
Are you the uncle of
the great poet Galib?

696
00:41:53,524 --> 00:41:55,185

00:58:39,396 --> 00:58:42,126
Now you should concentrate
on her marriage.

874
00:58:49,306 --> 00:58:51,297
Sunita, what has happened
to you so suddenly?

875
00:58:54,878 --> 00:58:56,140
You don't know.

876
00:58:58,682 --> 00:59:01,344
You have no idea of my situation
and my responsibilities.

877
00:59:03,486 --> 00:59:06,080
l fell like going far away from you.

878
00:59:06,423 --> 00:59:08,755
Go far away from me?
- Yes.

879
00:59:09,626 --> 00:59:12,094
And until l don't think
it over calmly..

880
00:59:12,162 --> 00:59:14,153
..l won't return to you.

881
00:59:16,499 --> 00:59:18,262
l will go away myself, Sunita.

882
00:59:20,704 --> 00:59:23,264
But you should think
it over clearly..

883
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:26,275
..that with your situation
and your responsibilities..

884
00:59:26,343 --> 00:59:29,278
..if you have just little space
for my love in your heart..

885
00:59:29,346 --> 00:59:32,110
..then at fortnight
you should meet me..

886
00:59:32,182 --> 00:59:34,116
.. by the monument of love..

887
00:59:34,184 --> 00:59:37,176
..which people refer
to as Taj Mahal.

888
00:59:39,522 --> 00:59:42,650
l would see if the dream of
my love is true or not.

889
00:59:43,526 --> 00:59:46,723
l would see if you
would come or not.

890
01:00:07,484 --> 01:00:10,146
You are going far away just
because you are a princess.

891
01:00:12,155 --> 01:00:13,679
Even Queen Mumtaz had asked..

892
01:00:13,757 --> 01:00:15,156
..the same question to a man.

893
01:00:16,159 --> 01:00:19,151
And his answer was Taj Mahal.

894
01:00:19,696 --> 01:00:21,323
You are a royal princess.

895
01:00:22,432 --> 01:00:25,333
The royalty is gone. Now
l'm just a princess..

896
01:00:25,402 --> 01:00:27,336
..in search of a prince.

897
01:00:29,506 --> 01:00:31,337
His memories will haunt you, Sunita.

898
01:00:31,508 --> 01:00:33,669
Just stop, Sunita!
- No!

899
01:00:33,843 --> 01:00:35,572
Go back, Sunita!
- No!

900
01:00:35,645 --> 01:00:37,510
Go back, Sunita! Stop!

901
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:38,638
No!

902
01:00:38,715 --> 01:00:41,240
Go back, Sunita!
- No!

903
01:02:18,214 --> 01:02:25,814
An emperor got the beautiful
Taj Mahal constructed.

904
01:02:27,424 --> 01:02:34,762
He gave the entire world
a monument of love.

905
01:02:36,332 --> 01:02:44,330
Love will always bloom
in its shadows.

906
01:02:44,707 --> 01:02:52,705
lt has given a never ending tale.

907
01:02:53,716 --> 01:03:01,646
An emperor got the beautiful
Taj Mahal constructed.

908
01:03:14,404 --> 01:03:22,311
This monument is so sacred
that lovers swear on it.

909
01:03:23,413 --> 01:03:31,479
And this monument fulfils
the wishes of lovers.

910
01:03:32,489 --> 01:03:40,419
l swear by the dreams
hidden in this marvel.

911
01:03:41,498 --> 01:03:49,428
The paths to love are easy
and difficult too.

912
01:03:50,507 --> 01:03:58,346
lt has given the heart a
reason to beat for love.

913
01:03:59,682 --> 01:04:07,282
An emperor got the beautiful
Taj Mahal constructed.

914
01:04:19,602 --> 01:04:27,475
This monument is a living
inspiration of a poet.

915
01:04:28,611 --> 01:04:36,541
And its stories are
fact not fiction.

916
01:04:37,554 --> 01:04:45,427
After coming here it
can be clearly seen.

917
01:04:46,563 --> 01:04:54,334
Life is meaningless without love.

918
01:04:55,638 --> 01:05:03,272
This monument has given
a new meaning to love.

919
01:05:04,514 --> 01:05:12,285
An emperor got the beautiful
Taj Mahal constructed.

920
01:05:24,467 --> 01:05:32,465
This beautiful night and
this exotic atmosphere.

921
01:05:33,476 --> 01:05:41,315
May this moment pause here,
my heart admits it desires.

922
01:05:42,418 --> 01:05:50,154
Love makes a human
love other humans.

923
01:05:51,227 --> 01:05:58,690
No one dares to deny love.

924
01:05:59,769 --> 01:06:07,505
Today destiny has given
us this beautiful night.

925
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:15,280
An emperor got the beautiful
Taj Mahal constructed.

926
01:06:17,453 --> 01:06:24,859
He gave the entire world
a monument of love.

927
01:06:26,396 --> 01:06:33,734
An emperor got the beautiful
Taj Mahal constructed.

928
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:10,103
l won't ask.
- Nothing? - No!

929
01:07:14,377 --> 01:07:16,106
Listen..

930
01:07:22,285 --> 01:07:24,719
Get a Taj Mahal constructed just
like this for me. - Like this?

931
01:07:26,189 --> 01:07:28,453
High, white, built completely
of marble.

932
01:07:29,292 --> 01:07:31,453
This Taj Mahal was made
by an emperor..

933
01:07:31,527 --> 01:07:33,119
..with the help of
his wealth, Sunita.

934
01:07:33,396 --> 01:07:35,455
l will give my life for you..

935
01:07:35,531 --> 01:07:37,658
..and make a Taj Mahal
from my blood.

936
01:07:38,301 --> 01:07:40,394
Why are saying such omen things
early in the morning?

937
01:07:40,536 --> 01:07:43,300
lf you have something else
in mind then ask for that.

938
01:07:43,406 --> 01:07:44,668
No!
- Ask me!

939
01:07:44,741 --> 01:07:47,141
No!
- Ask me! - No!

940
01:07:53,316 --> 01:07:55,147
What happened?
- My heart is thumping.

941
01:07:55,418 --> 01:07:56,476
What's wrong?

942
01:07:56,552 --> 01:07:58,315
Trouble is headed our way.

943
01:07:58,488 --> 01:08:00,422
Worry about our children.

944
01:08:00,623 --> 01:08:02,523
Where the heck did that
astrologer go to?

945
01:08:04,427 --> 01:08:05,621
Come..
- Why are you going there?

946
01:08:05,695 --> 01:08:07,492
There he is!
- Catch him.

947
01:08:11,501 --> 01:08:12,695
Come here, inspector sir.

948
01:08:12,769 --> 01:08:15,260
He is that bloody Vijay Khanna.

949
01:08:15,438 --> 01:08:17,269
Arrest this rascal!
- Absolutely!

950
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:19,374
He is right! He is absolutely right!

951
01:08:19,509 --> 01:08:21,170
Maybe you are having
a misconception.

952
01:08:21,310 --> 01:08:23,505
Absolutely not! He is Vijay Khanna.

953
01:08:23,613 --> 01:08:25,274
He is fraud!
- Yes!

954
01:08:25,448 --> 01:08:28,110
Madam, why are you roaming
around with him?

955
01:08:28,284 --> 01:08:30,184
He is definitely flirting with you.

956
01:08:30,286 --> 01:08:32,117
Take this ruffian away.

957
01:08:32,388 --> 01:08:33,582
Why are you silent?

958
01:08:33,656 --> 01:08:35,283
Why don't you tell them
it's all false?

959
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:42,193
lt's all true, Sunita. Forgive me.

960
01:08:42,665 --> 01:08:45,133
Sir, only the judge
can forgive you now..

961
01:08:45,201 --> 01:08:47,135
..in the court.
- You..

962
01:08:47,203 --> 01:08:48,465
What are you staring at him?

963
01:08:48,538 --> 01:08:50,130
Put handcuffs on him and arrest him.

964
01:08:54,544 --> 01:08:58,310
Guilty Vijay Khanna, who will
fight your case for you?

965
01:08:58,648 --> 01:09:01,139
Your honour, l study law.

966
01:09:01,617 --> 01:09:03,608
l will fight my own case.

967
01:09:04,353 --> 01:09:07,618
The court will allow it.
Let the hearing begin.

968
01:09:07,690 --> 01:09:10,250
Professor Khanna, is
the guilty your son.

969
01:09:11,694 --> 01:09:13,252
Yes! He is definitely my son.

970
01:09:13,429 --> 01:09:16,626
But he has been doing criminal
activities since childhood.

971
01:09:17,266 --> 01:09:19,564
l tried to stop him.
Mother tried it too.

972
01:09:19,635 --> 01:09:21,626
Brother explained him. But
he didn't listen to anyone.

973
01:09:21,771 --> 01:09:24,262
Your honour, l testify
that he just didn't..

974
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:27,104
..provoked those boys
to go with him..

975
01:09:27,176 --> 01:09:30,509
..but he left home
without my orders.

976
01:09:30,646 --> 01:09:33,274
Judge sir, don't listen
to my husband.

977
01:09:33,449 --> 01:09:34,711
He has lot his mind in his old age.

978
01:09:34,784 --> 01:09:36,274
Madam, please sit down.

979
01:09:36,385 --> 01:09:38,444
This is the court, not your kitchen.

980
01:09:39,522 --> 01:09:42,286
Professor Khanna, is it true that..

981
01:09:42,358 --> 01:09:46,294
..the guilty Vijay Khanna
is very intelligent.

982
01:09:46,395 --> 01:09:49,660
..and has been topping his
class from past five years.

983
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:53,131
What is the big deal about that?

984
01:09:53,302 --> 01:09:54,633
After all he is my son.

985
01:09:54,737 --> 01:09:58,138
And is it rue that you
have forcibly tried..

986
01:09:58,207 --> 01:10:02,303
..to lock up this intelligent
student.

987
01:10:03,412 --> 01:10:05,607
You fixed his marriage
without his will.

988
01:10:05,681 --> 01:10:07,148
And he was forced to
run away from home..

989
01:10:07,216 --> 01:10:09,150
..on the night of marriage.

990
01:10:09,485 --> 01:10:11,680
l'm his father. l have the
complete right over it.

991
01:10:12,221 --> 01:10:15,315
Was your son getting married
or you, professor Khanna?

992
01:10:15,424 --> 01:10:18,154
l'll slap you now! Rascal!

993
01:10:20,429 --> 01:10:25,162
Your honour, no further questions.

994
01:10:25,501 --> 01:10:27,162
Next witness!

995
01:10:29,772 --> 01:10:32,332
Do you agree that the guilty..

996
01:10:32,408 --> 01:10:34,706
..was pretending to be
an astrologer? - Yes.

997
01:10:34,777 --> 01:10:37,337
And he had planned the entire
run away scam of the boys..

998
01:10:37,413 --> 01:10:40,905
..and kept deceiving you all?
- Yes.

999
01:10:41,183 --> 01:10:43,344
That means he was cheating you all!
- Yes!

1000
01:10:43,653 --> 01:10:46,178
Definitely! Absolutely!
- Your honour!

1001
01:10:49,358 --> 01:10:51,189
Ms. Sunita!

1002
01:10:51,594 --> 01:10:55,189
Ms. Sunita!
- What is it?

1003
01:10:56,799 --> 01:11:00,633
Have you ever fallen in love
with someone? - Never!

1004
01:11:02,672 --> 01:11:04,663
Then on the night of 13th November..

1005
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:08,301
..why were you sleeping on the
shoulders of the guilty..

1006
01:11:08,377 --> 01:11:10,868
..in an unknown forest?

1007
01:11:11,213 --> 01:11:13,545
l didn't do it purposely.
l was feeling sleepy.

1008
01:11:13,649 --> 01:11:15,549
You were feeling sleepy?
- Yes, l was feeling sleepy.

1009
01:11:15,718 --> 01:11:18,312
And on the night of 19th November..

1010
01:11:18,387 --> 01:11:21,322
..when you were looking
at the Taj Mahal from..

1011
01:11:21,390 --> 01:11:23,483
..the banks of river Jamuna
then you will remember..

1012
01:11:23,559 --> 01:11:25,493
..that in a very poetic
way and romantic way..

1013
01:11:25,561 --> 01:11:27,324
..you had demanded something
from the guilty.

1014
01:11:27,563 --> 01:11:32,330
You had said, that can you built
a Taj Mahal for me too?

1015
01:11:33,336 --> 01:11:35,429
Were you sleeping at that
moment too, Ms. Sunita?

1016
01:11:35,571 --> 01:11:37,368
Did you made the Taj Mahal for me?

1017
01:11:38,574 --> 01:11:41,338
Your honour, the witness's
only regret is that..

1018
01:11:41,410 --> 01:11:44,174
..why wasn't her demands fulfilled.

1019
01:11:44,347 --> 01:11:46,178
Why wasn't a Taj Mahal made for her?

1020
01:11:46,349 --> 01:11:48,681
Your honour, you must know
about the high prices.

1021
01:11:49,251 --> 01:11:51,185
And if you break your head..

1022
01:11:51,253 --> 01:11:52,515
..then too you won't get
a piece of marble.

1023
01:11:52,722 --> 01:11:56,351
And look at her demands.
This is so unreasonable.

1024
01:11:57,793 --> 01:12:00,387
Ms. Sunita, what were
you thinking? Tell me.

1025
01:12:00,463 --> 01:12:02,124
Did you think that the guilty had..

1026
01:12:02,198 --> 01:12:04,132
..some machine to print money?

1027
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:06,725
Or does he have some farm that
yields gold and silver?

1028
01:12:07,303 --> 01:12:09,464
Aren't you ashamed of your self?
- What did you say?

1029
01:12:09,538 --> 01:12:11,130
Aren't you ashamed of your self?

1030
01:12:11,474 --> 01:12:14,307
Did l say all that you should
count them in front..

1031
01:12:14,377 --> 01:12:17,813
..of the court and embarrass
me in front of everyone?

1032
01:12:18,314 --> 01:12:20,475
l will never forgive you.

1033
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:23,150
l think you are an awful man.

1034
01:12:23,686 --> 01:12:27,144
Your honour, no further questions.

1035
01:12:31,494 --> 01:12:34,156
The court states that the
accusations charged..

1036
01:12:34,230 --> 01:12:36,630
..on the guilty are false.

1037
01:12:36,699 --> 01:12:39,167
The court states that the
irresponsible behaviour..

1038
01:12:39,235 --> 01:12:42,170
..of these boys is due
to the parents..

1039
01:12:42,238 --> 01:12:44,570
..not allowing them to roam around.

1040
01:12:45,441 --> 01:12:47,636
The court has found the
accused not guilty.

1041
01:12:47,710 --> 01:12:49,644
And orders to free him respectfully.

1042
01:12:49,712 --> 01:12:51,339
Hurray!

1043
01:12:55,518 --> 01:12:57,782
Just give me one for chance.
Just one last chance.

1044
01:12:57,853 --> 01:13:00,287
Please, Forgive me, Sunita.
l'm not that bad.

1045
01:13:00,656 --> 01:13:02,521
You are a much respected man.

1046
01:13:02,658 --> 01:13:04,785
After meeting you l have
received many things.

1047
01:13:05,327 --> 01:13:07,454
For making me so famous
in front of the judge..

1048
01:13:07,530 --> 01:13:09,327
..l thank you very much for that.

1049
01:13:10,466 --> 01:13:12,127
ldiot!

1050
01:13:14,303 --> 01:13:17,136
A girl from the royal family
was standing in court.

1051
01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:21,306
You know, everyone is
talking about this.

1052
01:13:23,479 --> 01:13:26,471
These middle class are boys
are like this only.

1053
01:13:26,682 --> 01:13:28,309
You are absolutely right,
your highness.

1054
01:13:28,551 --> 01:13:32,146
Really! lf you once
talk to them nicely..

1055
01:13:32,221 --> 01:13:35,657
..then they narrate it as a
romantic tale to everyone.

1056
01:13:37,693 --> 01:13:42,824
Sunita, just think what must be
Gen. Mahipat feeling about it?

1057
01:13:44,366 --> 01:13:46,163
What does Gen. Mahipat
have to do with this?

1058
01:13:46,569 --> 01:13:49,333
My royal blood is boiling
in fury, Ms. Sunita.

1059
01:13:49,839 --> 01:13:52,569
You blood boils in fury
on everything. So what?

1060
01:13:53,442 --> 01:13:56,240
Whatever it is. l cannot ignore
this matter anymore.

1061
01:13:56,645 --> 01:14:00,274
We are being defamed. After all
one day you will have to..

1062
01:14:02,518 --> 01:14:05,282
Mr. Mahindranath. When
did you arrive?

1063
01:14:05,454 --> 01:14:07,183
l have been waiting for you
since so long, you highness.

1064
01:14:08,290 --> 01:14:10,121
Hello, Sunita.

1065
01:14:10,659 --> 01:14:14,288
General, weren't you supposed
to go for boating?

1066
01:14:14,463 --> 01:14:17,523
Yes! We are going.

1067
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:20,131
Let's go, Sunita.

1068
01:14:21,403 --> 01:14:24,133
Okay, father. Goodbye. -Goodbye.

1069
01:14:26,542 --> 01:14:30,876
Your highness, l feel that Sunita
doesn't like Mahipat.

1070
01:14:31,313 --> 01:14:33,144
That's the whole problem.

1071
01:14:33,549 --> 01:14:35,483
These days it's very difficult
to find eligible boys..

1072
01:14:35,551 --> 01:14:38,213
..for a girl from the royal family.

1073
01:14:39,321 --> 01:14:40,481
The boy is very much
there, your highness.

1074
01:14:40,656 --> 01:14:42,556
lf you like him then
you can talk to him.

1075
01:14:42,658 --> 01:14:44,558
Who is it?
- He is your own servant.

1076
01:14:45,761 --> 01:14:47,558
Dhiru!
- Dhiru?

1077
01:14:49,565 --> 01:14:51,499
My son.
- Very good.

1078
01:14:52,434 --> 01:14:54,231
Tomorrow l'm going to Shyamgad.

1079
01:14:54,570 --> 01:14:56,333
We'll talk there itself.

1080
01:14:56,438 --> 01:14:58,167
Shameless! ldiot!

1081
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:01,273
Fraud men like you should
drown and die.

1082
01:15:01,443 --> 01:15:02,535
Not in a river or a lake.

1083
01:15:02,611 --> 01:15:04,511
ln just a drop of water.
You got that?

1084
01:15:04,580 --> 01:15:06,275
ln just a drop of water!

1085
01:15:07,449 --> 01:15:09,110
You are 100°%o right.

1086
01:15:09,518 --> 01:15:11,179
l'm 100°%o right.

1087
01:15:12,388 --> 01:15:14,447
This acting won't work in
front of me. Understood?

1088
01:15:14,623 --> 01:15:17,114
No, Sunita..
- l know all your ways.

1089
01:15:17,526 --> 01:15:19,585
You cheat! You fraud!

1090
01:15:20,396 --> 01:15:23,126
Sunita, you know my mother..

1091
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:27,460
My mother likes you very much.

1092
01:15:28,537 --> 01:15:30,334
She is very furious on me.

1093
01:15:30,539 --> 01:15:33,667
She was saying, you worthless fool!

1094
01:15:34,143 --> 01:15:36,475
How dare you get such a beautiful
and elegant girl..

1095
01:15:36,545 --> 01:15:38,479
..who has nice facial features..

1096
01:15:38,547 --> 01:15:40,310
..you made her stand in court?

1097
01:15:41,417 --> 01:15:43,146
And then she scolded me,
go right now..

1098
01:15:43,219 --> 01:15:45,744
..and bring my daughter-in-law home.

1099
01:15:47,423 --> 01:15:49,823
Bring daughter-in-law!
- Yes, bring daughter-in-law

1100
01:15:51,694 --> 01:15:54,322
Did she say that?
- Yes, she said it. Really!

1101
01:15:55,497 --> 01:15:56,555
Really?

1102
01:16:09,712 --> 01:16:12,579
Liar! Cheat! Fraud!
- l swear!

1103
01:16:12,648 --> 01:16:14,115
Shut up! Don't you feel ashamed..

1104
01:16:14,183 --> 01:16:16,117
..to use your mother's name
for your own greedily use?

1105
01:16:16,285 --> 01:16:17,582
C'mon, move aside.

1106
01:16:17,653 --> 01:16:19,450
Gen. Mahipat is waiting
for me there.

1107
01:16:22,658 --> 01:16:24,125
Hello!

1108
01:16:24,727 --> 01:16:26,126
Hello, Sunita!

1109
01:16:27,296 --> 01:16:29,526
What do you care for this
fatso with big moustaches?

1110
01:16:30,132 --> 01:16:31,724
He likes me from childhood.

1111
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:33,734
And don't you dare come
in front of him.

1112
01:16:33,802 --> 01:16:35,463
He will break you into pieces.

1113
01:16:37,406 --> 01:16:40,136
Listen, if you go with him then
l'll become blood thirsty.

1114
01:16:40,209 --> 01:16:42,143
You got that?
- l will do whatever l like.

1115
01:16:42,211 --> 01:16:44,145
Who are you to order me?

1116
01:16:45,681 --> 01:16:48,548
Sunita! The consequences
will be unimaginable.

1117
01:16:49,318 --> 01:16:52,617
l'm warning you for the last time.

1118
01:16:54,323 --> 01:16:56,154

Did you see that?
- May l help you?

1122
01:17:09,505 --> 01:17:11,632
Oh yes! Certainly you may.

1123
01:17:12,641 --> 01:17:15,109
lt's so kind of you indeed.

1124
01:17:27,389 --> 01:17:29,118
Excuse me!

1125
01:17:31,393 --> 01:17:33,122

Beautiful hands.

1133
01:17:57,219 --> 01:17:59,687
English girl, Europe girl,
white girl.. beautiful!

1134
01:18:00,255 --> 01:18:02,246
lndian girl.. no good.

1135

Fat ugly man!

1143
01:18:42,664 --> 01:18:47,124
When you smile, then it feels
that a flower is blooming.

1144
01:18:50,406 --> 01:18:52,670
Traitor! Do you know what she says?

1145

Getting beaten up by a woman.

1170
01:20:54,363 --> 01:20:56,194
Getting beaten up by a woman.

01:21:07,142 --> 01:21:09,133
Sunita, wait please. Stop, Sunita!

Come closer, you fraud!

1182
01:21:24,326 --> 01:21:26,487
Where did you leave your
white madam? - No!

1183
01:21:27,329 --> 01:21:29,160
Take this. Take more!

1184
01:21:29,498 --> 01:21:31,159
What is this lunacy?

1185
01:21:31,567 --> 01:21:34,331
Take this flower.
- How dare you?

1186
01:21:34,436 --> 01:21:35,494
Look, it was just a flower.

1187
01:21:35,571 --> 01:21:36,697
Listen to me, Sunita!

And you were praying
to that Goddess?

Yes, l was praying.
- No, l was not praying.

1197

Don't hit me!

1198

My bones will be broken.
- Leave it.

1199
01:22:02,664 --> 01:22:04,291
l'm saying l'll hit you.

1200
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:08,130
Now tell me. Should l hit you?

Should l hit more?
- Vijay, l'm warning you.

1204

lt hurts, Vijay.

1205
01:22:26,488 --> 01:22:30,424
You love me and you fight with me.

1206
01:22:35,497 --> 01:22:39,331
Oh, you have killed me!

1207
01:22:44,506 --> 01:22:48,567
You don't understand it now.
Don't lift the dagger.

1208
01:22:53,448 --> 01:22:57,350
See that your wrist isn't hurt.

1209
01:23:13,535 --> 01:23:17,528
You are acting so rude
with me today.

1210
01:23:17,739 --> 01:23:22,142
You seem so beautiful.

1211
01:23:24,546 --> 01:23:29,142
This heart wishes that l
should sacrifice my life.

1212
01:23:33,488 --> 01:23:37,549
Nothing bad should happen
to you in love.

1213
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:55,572
l accept every attitude of beauty.

1214
01:23:55,777 --> 01:24:00,180
Even the anger of maidens
seems so good.

1215
01:24:02,517 --> 01:24:06,453
You used the arrow
of eyes on my heart.

1216
01:24:11,526 --> 01:24:15,292
Here, l took the wound
even when l knew it.

1217
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:35,314
Don't murder my heart like this.

1218
01:24:35,650 --> 01:24:39,643
Just one attack of
your eyes is enough.

1219
01:24:42,557 --> 01:24:46,493
This is the age of
trying our love.

1220
01:24:51,166 --> 01:24:55,159
Be disloyal to me like this.

1221
01:25:29,304 --> 01:25:30,464
Of course not.

1222
01:25:32,674 --> 01:25:34,301
The girl has come to meet you.

1223
01:25:34,476 --> 01:25:36,535
She will never come in this house.

1224
01:25:36,645 --> 01:25:38,135
She will never step into this house.

1225
01:25:38,213 --> 01:25:40,147
She is speaking to mother.

1226
01:25:41,750 --> 01:25:43,149
Suneeta..

1227
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:46,480
Mother..

1228
01:25:46,555 --> 01:25:48,147
l am coming.

1229
01:25:54,329 --> 01:25:57,162
Bless you. Bless you.

1230
01:26:01,269 --> 01:26:02,429
Daughter..

1231
01:26:02,504 --> 01:26:04,096
ls this possible?

1232
01:26:04,272 --> 01:26:06,604
The man whose skin should be
flayed and made into shoes.

1233
01:26:06,708 --> 01:26:09,108
Can you ever forgive such a man?

1234
01:26:09,644 --> 01:26:13,102
Tell us, daughter. You forgave
our son, isn't it?

1235
01:26:15,450 --> 01:26:17,281
l forgave him.
- Did you hear that?

1236
01:26:18,386 --> 01:26:20,115
What is this that l am hearing?

1237
01:26:20,522 --> 01:26:23,286
The stupid fool who
rejected your love..

1238
01:26:23,358 --> 01:26:26,725
..the one who made you
cry, you like him?

1239
01:26:30,465 --> 01:26:32,660
And you want to marry
this fool too? Tell me!

1240
01:26:36,738 --> 01:26:39,138
lmpossible! What is happening
to this world?

1241
01:26:39,541 --> 01:26:41,304
Did you listen to what is happening?

1242
01:26:41,409 --> 01:26:43,206
Whatever is happening
is for the good.

1243
01:26:43,345 --> 01:26:45,142
A beautiful daughter-in-law
has come into the house..

1244
01:26:45,213 --> 01:26:47,147
..and you are just going on arguing.

1245
01:26:47,215 --> 01:26:50,412
See, daughter. don't tell
me anything after this.

1246
01:26:50,552 --> 01:26:52,349
l won't be responsible for anything.

1247
01:26:52,420 --> 01:26:54,547
This marriage will take place
tomorrow, in this house.

1248
01:26:54,823 --> 01:26:56,484
Why are you just staring at me?

1249
01:26:56,658 --> 01:26:58,319
Go and get my sherwani.

1250
01:26:58,493 --> 01:27:01,087
You are wearing it. But
where are you going?

1251
01:27:01,263 --> 01:27:04,255
l am going to fix the proposal
with the girl's father.

1252
01:27:05,367 --> 01:27:06,425
Come on, Naren.

1253
01:27:07,369 --> 01:27:10,429
Father.. this is the matter
of marriage and all that.

1254
01:27:10,505 --> 01:27:12,268
So the girl's parents
should come first.

1255
01:27:12,374 --> 01:27:15,104
Why do you need to go?
- He is right, daddy.

1256
01:27:15,510 --> 01:27:17,102
Even l had make Lala Kesarichand..

1257
01:27:17,178 --> 01:27:18,509
..take thirty six
rounds of my house.

1258
01:27:18,580 --> 01:27:20,104
And only then did l let
him touch my shoulder.

1259
01:27:20,282 --> 01:27:22,512
Correct. We will go and
bring him right away.

1260
01:27:22,584 --> 01:27:24,108
Come on. Come.

1261
01:27:25,287 --> 01:27:26,379
Come from here.

1262
01:27:26,454 --> 01:27:28,445
Okay, bye father. Bye mother,
bye brother.

1263
01:27:32,627 --> 01:27:37,189
The girl is so beautiful.
Please smile.

1264
01:27:37,532 --> 01:27:40,467
Be happy at least some time.
You are always so glum.

1265
01:27:41,469 --> 01:27:43,130
One problem has gone and
the other has come up.

1266
01:27:43,204 --> 01:27:46,537
What is the problem in this? You
father is a human after all.

1267
01:27:46,641 --> 01:27:48,734
We will beg and convince
him somehow.

1268
01:27:50,412 --> 01:27:52,607
He will shoot you. You
don't know who he is.

1269
01:27:52,681 --> 01:27:55,309
Who is he? ls he a dictator?
He is a king or something?

1270
01:27:55,750 --> 01:27:57,615
lf not him, we will
bring someone else.

1271
01:27:57,686 --> 01:27:59,313
Don't you have any
uncle or anything?

1272
01:27:59,387 --> 01:28:02,083
No.. No.. No..
- That Jailer is there.

1273
01:28:02,157 --> 01:28:04,091
Should we put a beard
on him and bring him?

1274
01:28:05,260 --> 01:28:07,091
No?

1275
01:28:09,264 --> 01:28:10,356
There is one.

1276
01:28:10,498 --> 01:28:13,160
Tell the priest whatever
you have in your heart.

1277
01:28:14,369 --> 01:28:17,634
l will be waiting for you.
l will pray for you.

1278
01:28:20,508 --> 01:28:24,103
Go. - l will go. l will go.

1279
01:28:31,653 --> 01:28:34,713
Mother. Please make
my love successful.

1280
01:28:35,724 --> 01:28:38,284
l don't want anything except
Vijay in my life.

1281
01:28:39,294 --> 01:28:41,125
l don't want anything else, mother.

1282
01:28:42,413 --> 01:28:43,812
Can you keep your hand on
your heart and tell that..

1283
01:28:43,881 --> 01:28:46,315
..you are worthy of getting
married to her?

1284
01:28:47,485 --> 01:28:48,816
Yes.

1285
01:28:49,220 --> 01:28:50,812
l keep my hand on my
heart and say that..

1286
01:28:50,888 --> 01:28:52,412
..my love for Sunita is true.

1287
01:28:52,890 --> 01:28:55,825
lf your love is true then
why did you betray Sunita..

1288
01:28:55,893 --> 01:28:57,884
..about yourself from
so many days?

1289
01:28:58,162 --> 01:29:00,153
Actually Mr. Acharya,
the situation only..

1290
01:29:00,231 --> 01:29:01,425
..had become complicated.

1291
01:29:02,033 --> 01:29:05,161
Actually, my parents wanted
to get me married forcefully.

1292
01:29:05,436 --> 01:29:07,165
And l was running
away from marriage.

1293
01:29:07,238 --> 01:29:08,830
And when l ran away
then the boys also..

1294
01:29:08,906 --> 01:29:11,033
..started running behind me.

1295
01:29:11,109 --> 01:29:12,167
When the boys ran
behind me then..

1296
01:29:12,243 --> 01:29:13,835
..the police also
came behind me.

1297
01:29:13,911 --> 01:29:15,173
Tell me, what could l do?

1298
01:29:15,246 --> 01:29:16,372
l said some wrong things.

1299
01:29:16,447 --> 01:29:19,382
You print such insensible
things in your newspaper also.

1300
01:29:19,450 --> 01:29:20,849
lt is not my fault.

1301
01:29:20,918 --> 01:29:22,180
The public demands for it.

1302
01:29:22,253 --> 01:29:24,312
They want sensationalism.

1303
01:29:24,389 --> 01:29:26,254
Somebody has killed someone.

1304
01:29:26,324 --> 01:29:28,383
Somebody's wife has
eloped with someone.

1305
01:29:28,459 --> 01:29:29,858
Some minister has taken
bribe from someone.

1306
01:29:29,927 --> 01:29:31,861
There was a bomb explosion
in the parliament house.

1307
01:29:31,929 --> 01:29:33,191
Until and unless you don't
flatter about the news..

1308
01:29:33,264 --> 01:29:34,458
..it doesn't becomes
interesting.

1309
01:29:34,932 --> 01:29:37,196
But l guarantee you about
one thing, Mr. Acharya.

1310
01:29:37,268 --> 01:29:38,394
Guarantee?
- Yes.

1311
01:29:38,469 --> 01:29:39,868
Let anything happen.

1312
01:29:39,937 --> 01:29:40,995
Let the world change
its direction.

1313
01:29:41,072 --> 01:29:42,198
Or let us have to bring
the stars from the sky..

1314
01:29:42,273 --> 01:29:43,399
..but l will keep Sunita
in a lot of peace.

1315
01:29:43,474 --> 01:29:44,805
Just like a flower.

1316
01:29:45,476 --> 01:29:46,807
Please.

1317
01:29:47,879 --> 01:29:50,143
l feel very sad after hearing
your talks, Vijay.

1318
01:29:52,884 --> 01:29:54,818
These lies of coward young
people like you..

1319
01:29:54,886 --> 01:29:56,353
..will ruin our country one day.

1320
01:29:56,421 --> 01:29:57,820
But where is the question
of truth and lies..

1321
01:29:57,889 --> 01:29:59,413
..over here, Mr. Acharya?

1322
01:29:59,891 --> 01:30:01,825
You are such a big leader
yourself that you know..

1323
01:30:01,893 --> 01:30:03,827
..that in these elections
which are going on..

1324
01:30:03,895 --> 01:30:06,420
..your enemies are preaching
about the truth in front of us.

1325
01:30:06,898 --> 01:30:08,832
And all the bribing and
fraud is going on..

1326
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:10,424
..secretly among themselves.

1327
01:30:10,902 --> 01:30:13,837
The good things about truth
which we had learned..

1328
01:30:13,905 --> 01:30:15,839
..in the books in our childhood
and which we had..

1329
01:30:15,907 --> 01:30:17,841
..made our principles, all
those teachings are stored..

1330
01:30:17,909 --> 01:30:20,343
..in the safe of the rich
people, Mr. Acharya.

1331
01:30:20,912 --> 01:30:22,846
Now wherever or on whichever
side, you will see that..

1332
01:30:22,914 --> 01:30:24,848
..the soul of a human being
is dancing to the tunes..

1333
01:30:24,916 --> 01:30:27,180
..of money and wealth.

1334
01:30:27,251 --> 01:30:28,377
lt is dancing.

1335
01:30:28,453 --> 01:30:30,444
All this is just the
imagination of your mind, Vijay.

1336
01:30:30,922 --> 01:30:32,446
You cannot see anything
except for all this.

1337
01:30:32,523 --> 01:30:33,854
lf there will be something then
only l will be able to see.

1338
01:30:33,925 --> 01:30:35,119
lf there will be something
then only l will..

1339
01:30:35,193 --> 01:30:36,319
..be able to see, Mr. Acharya.

1340
01:30:36,394 --> 01:30:37,861
Even l was every interested.

1341
01:30:37,929 --> 01:30:39,055
Even l had the determination
that..

1342
01:30:39,130 --> 01:30:40,256
..even l will definitely
become something.

1343
01:30:40,331 --> 01:30:41,798
l will definitely do something.
l will serve the nation.

1344
01:30:42,333 --> 01:30:43,800
But when we see around us then..

1345
01:30:43,868 --> 01:30:45,130
..there is fraud and betrayal
on all the sides.

1346
01:30:45,203 --> 01:30:46,329
lf you will drink the
water of the tap then..

1347
01:30:46,404 --> 01:30:47,803
..there is a mixture
of medicines in it.

1348
01:30:47,872 --> 01:30:48,998
lf you will breath then
there is the mixture..

1349
01:30:49,073 --> 01:30:50,267
..of the polluted
air from the mills.

1350
01:30:50,341 --> 01:30:51,808
lf you will eat food then
there is a mixture..

1351
01:30:51,876 --> 01:30:53,002
..of mud in the flour.

1352
01:30:53,077 --> 01:30:54,408
There are lies on all the sides.

1353
01:30:54,479 --> 01:30:56,811
ln prayers, in salutations, in
love, in enmity, in anger..

1354
01:30:56,881 --> 01:30:58,405
..everywhere there are lies.

1355
01:30:58,883 --> 01:31:00,817
Vijay, the love of your
mother with which..

1356
01:31:00,885 --> 01:31:04,480
..you have been born and
brought up, was it false?

1357
01:31:08,159 --> 01:31:09,820
No. lt wasn't false.

1358
01:31:09,894 --> 01:31:11,828
The feeling of love
which you have..

1359
01:31:11,896 --> 01:31:13,887
..in your heart for Sunita,
is that also a lie?

1360
01:31:15,166 --> 01:31:16,326
No.

1361
01:31:18,169 --> 01:31:22,162
The sunlight, the moonlight,
the clouds, the rain..

1362
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:23,832
..the river water, the crops
that grow in the fields.

1363
01:31:23,908 --> 01:31:25,239
Are all these things also false?

1364
01:31:25,309 --> 01:31:27,004
ls there a fraud and illegal
mixing in all these things also?

1365
01:31:27,912 --> 01:31:29,379
No. All this is fine.

1366
01:31:29,447 --> 01:31:31,176
lt is not fine. l want
to ask you whether..

1367
01:31:31,249 --> 01:31:32,841
..all these things
are true or false?

1368
01:31:32,917 --> 01:31:35,852
Your love, your heart beat, the
blood that is running in your..

1369
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:38,912
..veins, your hands, legs, are
all these things true or false?

1370
01:31:38,990 --> 01:31:40,958
All this is true, Mr. Acharya.

1371
01:31:41,025 --> 01:31:42,959
But you have a look
at the world.

1372
01:31:43,027 --> 01:31:44,358
The world has changed so much.

1373
01:31:44,428 --> 01:31:46,293
The helplessness of young
and coward people..

1374
01:31:46,364 --> 01:31:48,127
..like you have not
changed this world.

1375
01:31:48,199 --> 01:31:49,791
The people who are responsible
for changing..

1376
01:31:49,867 --> 01:31:51,129
..this world are they who
are as strong as rocks..

1377
01:31:51,202 --> 01:31:53,329
..and who have not bothered
about day and night.

1378
01:31:53,404 --> 01:31:55,463
They have not bothered about
the gains and losses.

1379
01:31:55,873 --> 01:31:57,807
This wonderful era of human
beings is the result..

1380
01:31:57,875 --> 01:31:59,001
..of the struggle
of those people..

1381
01:31:59,076 --> 01:32:00,202
..who have discovered
the methods..

1382
01:32:00,278 --> 01:32:01,802
..to generate electricity
from running water.

1383
01:32:01,879 --> 01:32:03,005
They have been able
to remove the coal..

1384
01:32:03,080 --> 01:32:04,206
..from the midst of
the earth's crust.

1385
01:32:04,282 --> 01:32:06,147
And they have used it
to fuel the machines.

1386
01:32:06,217 --> 01:32:07,809
They have been able to obstruct
the winds of the sky.

1387
01:32:07,885 --> 01:32:09,011
They have been able to fly.

1388
01:32:09,086 --> 01:32:11,418
And now they want to step over
it and touch the stars.

1389
01:32:11,889 --> 01:32:14,289
They are the ones who have changed
this world. lt's their strength.

1390
01:32:14,358 --> 01:32:16,826
lt is not that unwillingness
with which you want food..

1391
01:32:16,894 --> 01:32:19,488
..to fill your stomach
and a shelter to sleep.

1392
01:32:22,166 --> 01:32:24,828
l don't have any reply
to give you, Mr. Acharya.

1393
01:32:24,902 --> 01:32:26,164
This is not my thinking.

1394
01:32:26,237 --> 01:32:27,829
This is the call of
the time, Vijay.

1395
01:32:27,905 --> 01:32:29,839
lt is the call of those crores
of young and innocent kids..

1396
01:32:29,907 --> 01:32:32,432
..who are going to
play in your laps.

1397
01:32:32,910 --> 01:32:34,844
Don't give them a chance
to say that..

1398
01:32:34,912 --> 01:32:36,846
..the people who have given
birth to them has left..

1399
01:32:36,914 --> 01:32:39,439
..this deserted monument
of principles for them.

1400
01:32:41,118 --> 01:32:42,779
When the mud in our body
will mix with the mud..

1401
01:32:42,853 --> 01:32:44,787
..of this nation then they
should not say that..

1402
01:32:44,855 --> 01:32:46,789
..our ancestors have given
us such an unholy mud..

1403
01:32:46,857 --> 01:32:48,848
..as a part of their property.

1404
01:32:49,860 --> 01:32:51,794
l pray to God that you should
be blessed with..

1405
01:32:51,862 --> 01:32:54,126
..the lives of thousands of
people like me, Mr. Acharya.

1406
01:32:54,465 --> 01:32:56,456
What is the guarantee
of life, son?

1407
01:32:57,134 --> 01:33:00,399
Who knows from where
does death enters?

1408
01:33:01,272 --> 01:33:02,796
When the process of
this breathing stops?

1409
01:33:04,875 --> 01:33:07,810
Yes. l have one prayer to God.

1410
01:33:07,878 --> 01:33:10,813
That we should be able to
understand the truth..

1411
01:33:10,881 --> 01:33:13,145
..speak the truth and walk
on the path of truth..

1412
01:33:13,217 --> 01:33:14,809
..till the end of our lives.

1413
01:33:18,889 --> 01:33:20,823
Stop! Get hold of him!

1414
01:33:25,162 --> 01:33:26,823
Save! Save! Save!

1415
01:33:29,433 --> 01:33:30,832
Catch him! Catch him!

1416
01:33:37,908 --> 01:33:39,000
Murderer!

1417
01:33:44,849 --> 01:33:47,784
No! l have not killed him. No.

1418
01:33:47,852 --> 01:33:50,946
Catch him.
- No! No!

1419
01:34:03,334 --> 01:34:04,801
What did you say?

1420
01:34:04,869 --> 01:34:06,131
Has Mr. Acharya been killed?

1421
01:34:06,203 --> 01:34:07,329
Mr. Acharya has been killed.

1422
01:34:07,405 --> 01:34:08,804
Go to the hermitage immediately.

1423
01:34:44,842 --> 01:34:47,106
This is the price for your work.

1424
01:34:48,379 --> 01:34:49,778
Count it.

1425
01:34:52,850 --> 01:34:55,114
You people are merchants,
Mr. Diwan.

1426
01:34:59,123 --> 01:35:01,387
l have faith on you all.

1427
01:35:01,859 --> 01:35:02,985
lf you all wouldn't have
killed him then..

1428
01:35:03,060 --> 01:35:04,186
..he would have killed you all.

1429
01:35:04,261 --> 01:35:05,785
You are absolutely right.

1430
01:35:06,397 --> 01:35:09,798
Now your election is
certain Mr. Ghatak.

1431
01:35:10,401 --> 01:35:11,800
Congratulations!

1432
01:35:11,869 --> 01:35:13,336
Congratulations! - Thank you!
- Congratulations! - Thank you.

1433
01:35:13,404 --> 01:35:15,201
Thank you! Thank you!

1434
01:35:15,272 --> 01:35:16,796
But this is too much, Mr. Diwan.

1435
01:35:16,874 --> 01:35:18,273
l am not ready for this thing.

1436
01:35:18,342 --> 01:35:19,400
For which thing?

1437
01:35:19,477 --> 01:35:20,967
This is a murder. This is murder.

1438
01:35:21,045 --> 01:35:22,979
And Mr. Acharya was
a very nice man. l mean..

1439
01:35:23,147 --> 01:35:25,138
People used to worship him.

1440
01:35:25,416 --> 01:35:28,146
His heart was full of pain and
well being of the public.

1441
01:35:28,219 --> 01:35:29,413
l understand this.

1442
01:35:29,487 --> 01:35:33,150
And l also know that he
was insisting to ruin us.

1443
01:35:33,891 --> 01:35:35,825
And even you know it very
well that if he..

1444
01:35:35,893 --> 01:35:37,827
..would have been alive then
instead of our bribe..

1445
01:35:37,895 --> 01:35:41,228
..not even 5 votes would
have been in your favour.

1446
01:35:41,365 --> 01:35:44,095
This happens in politics.

1447
01:35:44,168 --> 01:35:45,760
This also happens in politics..

1448
01:35:45,836 --> 01:35:47,827
..that in order to
fulfil our greed..

1449
01:35:47,905 --> 01:35:50,100
..people use their community
and their nation as an excuse.

1450
01:35:50,374 --> 01:35:52,308
They don't kill one
but lakhs of people.

1451
01:35:52,376 --> 01:35:53,775
Am l wrong?

1452
01:35:53,844 --> 01:35:54,970
This is right but..

1453
01:35:55,045 --> 01:35:56,774
And this is also right
Mr. Ghatak that..

1454
01:35:56,847 --> 01:35:59,441
..we are ready to spend lakhs
of rupees for your election.

1455
01:36:00,284 --> 01:36:01,774
And this is your deal with
us that as soon as..

1456
01:36:01,852 --> 01:36:03,786
..you are elected, the first
thing that you will do is..

1457
01:36:03,854 --> 01:36:06,789
..to give the authority to me
to take the decision about..

1458
01:36:06,857 --> 01:36:09,849
..the inquiries taking
place about my company.

1459
01:36:09,927 --> 01:36:12,452
And the ban on my factory
will be lifted.

1460
01:36:12,997 --> 01:36:14,794
And the accusation of earning
lakhs of rupees..

1461
01:36:14,865 --> 01:36:18,460
..by betraying the public will
be withdrawn by the government.

1462
01:36:18,869 --> 01:36:20,803
When have l disagreed?

1463
01:36:20,871 --> 01:36:22,805
But it really upsets
me very much.

1464
01:36:22,873 --> 01:36:25,341
You all have taken up
a very big danger.

1465
01:36:25,409 --> 01:36:26,808
And we all have promised to
hold on to each other..

1466
01:36:26,877 --> 01:36:28,276
..in this danger.

1467
01:36:28,345 --> 01:36:29,812
But someday or the other,
the police will..

1468
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:32,280
..definitely arrest
this boy Vijay.

1469
01:36:32,349 --> 01:36:35,216
So will he accept that he has
himself killed Mr. Acharya?

1470
01:36:35,286 --> 01:36:37,811
We all know that Vijay's arrest
can create a danger..

1471
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:40,220
..for all of us.

1472
01:36:41,225 --> 01:36:46,162
But Mr. Ghatak, Vijay
will not be arrested.

1473
01:36:46,363 --> 01:36:48,228
How will he not be arrested,
Mr. Diwan?

1474
01:36:48,299 --> 01:36:49,766
What do you consider
the police as?

1475
01:36:49,834 --> 01:36:52,166
He will not be arrested
Mr. Ghatak because..

1476
01:36:52,236 --> 01:36:56,172
..he will be hidden from the
reach of the police forever.

1477
01:36:57,241 --> 01:37:00,904
The problem will be uprooted
from its base.

1478
01:37:01,178 --> 01:37:02,270
You?

1479
01:37:02,346 --> 01:37:03,779
Will you commit one
more murder, Garga?

1480
01:37:29,874 --> 01:37:31,808
There he is. Get hold of him.

1481
01:37:31,876 --> 01:37:33,138
Don't let him run away.

1482
01:38:51,889 --> 01:38:55,154
Lord, you know that l have
not committed any murder.

1483
01:38:55,893 --> 01:38:58,225
You know it God that
l am innocent.

1484
01:38:58,896 --> 01:39:01,160
Please save me. Please
save me, God.

1485
01:39:01,231 --> 01:39:02,823
Please save me.

1486
01:39:12,042 --> 01:39:13,339
Come son, come.

1487
01:39:18,449 --> 01:39:19,848
Come.

1488
01:39:24,922 --> 01:39:26,184
Priest.

1489
01:39:27,257 --> 01:39:28,849
Priest please let me go inside.

1490
01:39:28,926 --> 01:39:30,052
l want to meet him.

1491
01:39:30,127 --> 01:39:31,321
But whom do you want
to meet, child?

1492
01:39:31,395 --> 01:39:32,862
There is no one inside.

1493
01:39:32,930 --> 01:39:34,192
Don't doubt me, priest.

1494
01:39:34,264 --> 01:39:36,198
l will not lie in
this house of God.

1495
01:39:36,266 --> 01:39:37,392
Please let me go inside.

1496
01:39:37,468 --> 01:39:38,867
He needs me very
badly right now.

1497
01:39:44,408 --> 01:39:46,467
Vijay! Vijay!

1498
01:39:48,345 --> 01:39:50,472
Vijay! Vijay!

1499
01:39:51,348 --> 01:39:52,815
Where are you, Vijay?

1500
01:39:53,884 --> 01:39:55,818
Vijay, where are you?

1501
01:39:58,422 --> 01:40:00,481
Vijay! Vijay!

1502
01:40:01,325 --> 01:40:02,815
What has happened to you, Vijay?

1503
01:40:02,893 --> 01:40:04,019
What has happened to you?

1504
01:40:04,094 --> 01:40:06,358
Sunita, l have not
killed anyone.

1505
01:40:06,430 --> 01:40:07,829
l am telling the truth.

1506
01:40:07,898 --> 01:40:09,024
l know.

1507
01:40:09,233 --> 01:40:10,359
What happened?

1508
01:40:10,434 --> 01:40:12,163
What happened, Vijay?
- lts my wound, Sunita.

1509
01:40:12,236 --> 01:40:13,362
Vijay!

1510
01:40:13,437 --> 01:40:14,836
Don't worry, Vijay.

1511
01:40:14,905 --> 01:40:16,896
Everything will be all right.

1512
01:40:18,042 --> 01:40:19,373
lt's good that you
have come, Sunita.

1513
01:40:19,443 --> 01:40:22,173
lt's good that you have come.
lt's good that you have come.

1514
01:40:22,913 --> 01:40:26,178
Vijay! Vijay!

1515
01:40:27,384 --> 01:40:29,909
Vijay! Vijay!
- Yes.

1516
01:40:30,921 --> 01:40:32,013
Vijay!

1517
01:41:02,886 --> 01:41:04,820
What type of a mother are you?

1518
01:41:04,888 --> 01:41:06,321
ls this your motherly love?

1519
01:41:07,157 --> 01:41:08,818
l had come to take
your blessings?

1520
01:41:08,892 --> 01:41:10,291
But what have you done?

1521
01:41:10,894 --> 01:41:12,361
My lover cannot be
a murderer, mother.

1522
01:41:12,429 --> 01:41:14,488
My lover cannot be a murderer.

1523
01:42:09,887 --> 01:42:12,412
'O queen of this beautiful
heaven!'

1524
01:42:12,890 --> 01:42:15,154
'Please give me my beloved.'

1525
01:42:15,893 --> 01:42:18,418
'You have the sake
of your attitude.'

1526
01:42:18,896 --> 01:42:20,955
'Please give back my love.'

1527
01:42:21,298 --> 01:42:24,165
'Do you know that l am beauty?'

1528
01:42:24,234 --> 01:42:26,498
'And beauty rules over here.'

1529
01:42:27,171 --> 01:42:28,331
'Don't take the name
of love over here.'

1530
01:42:28,405 --> 01:42:29,565
'l hate people who are in love.'

1531
01:42:29,907 --> 01:42:32,341
'The garden where l belong to..

1532
01:42:32,910 --> 01:42:38,177
..the hearts of flower
buds beat over there.'

1533
01:42:38,448 --> 01:42:40,848
'Love and pleasure has
an important status..

1534
01:42:43,387 --> 01:42:49,951
'Look, love is nothing other
than just a stone in my party.'

1535
01:42:50,194 --> 01:42:52,458
'Give life to it through
your pleasures.'

1536
01:42:52,863 --> 01:42:55,263
'Or else ruin your own
life also over here.'

1537
01:43:06,476 --> 01:43:10,003
The decision of our love is
being taken today, O beloved!

1538
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:13,413
Today my destiny
will be changed.

1539
01:43:13,817 --> 01:43:17,150
The decision of our love is
being taken today, O beloved!

1540
01:43:17,221 --> 01:43:20,418
Today my destiny
will be changed.

1541
01:43:20,490 --> 01:43:23,948
lf you are soft hearted
than l don't mind.

1542
01:43:24,027 --> 01:43:27,360
The stone will melt
with my pleasures.

1543
01:43:27,431 --> 01:43:30,491
The decision of our love is
being taken today, O beloved!

1544
01:43:30,901 --> 01:43:34,234
Today my destiny
will be changed.

1545
01:43:41,311 --> 01:43:44,838
Look, l am very wounded.

1546
01:43:46,383 --> 01:43:49,784
l am bowing at your feet
with my head bent low.

1547
01:43:49,853 --> 01:43:53,983
Come and take me in your
arms otherwise then..

1548
01:43:55,125 --> 01:43:58,390
Come and take me in your
arms otherwise then..

1549
01:43:58,862 --> 01:44:00,261
The matter will
remain pending.

1550
01:44:00,330 --> 01:44:02,127
The time will pass away.

1551
01:44:02,199 --> 01:44:05,293
Today my destiny
will be changed.

1552
01:44:15,979 --> 01:44:19,972
My heart wants its sweetheart.

1553
01:44:21,151 --> 01:44:24,416

Today my destiny

lf you are soft hearted

1559
01:44:43,307 --> 01:44:46,299
The stone will melt
with my pleasures.

1560
01:44:46,376 --> 01:44:49,777
The decision of our love is
being taken today, O beloved!

O my life! O my darling!

01:47:34,411 --> 01:47:45,288
Love can never be separated
from beauty.

01:47:51,294 --> 01:48:00,930
lf a heart is indeed a heart
then it cannot be helpless.

1572
01:48:10,447 --> 01:48:13,439
Sunita! Sunita!

1573
01:48:15,986 --> 01:48:19,945
Sunita! Sunita!

1574
01:48:24,127 --> 01:48:25,389

Daughter.

1579
01:48:35,872 --> 01:48:38,466
Daughter, there is nobody

1581
01:48:41,478 --> 01:48:42,809
Please be quick.

1582
01:48:44,147 --> 01:48:46,138
Are you fine, Vijay?
- Yes.

1583
01:48:48,485 --> 01:48:49,816
Was there any message
from the control room?

1584
01:48:49,886 --> 01:48:51,148
Nothing sir.

1585
01:48:51,354 --> 01:48:53,481
And from Bombay Central
or VT station? - No sir.

1586
01:48:54,891 --> 01:48:56,358
He must not escape.

1587
01:49:44,007 --> 01:49:46,475
Vijay! Vijay, let's go behind.

1588
01:49:46,876 --> 01:49:48,207
They are coming.
- No. No.

1589
01:49:48,278 --> 01:49:51,145
No. Come on. You will
have to come. Come.

1590
01:50:02,425 --> 01:50:03,824
The car is empty, Garga.

1591
01:50:06,429 --> 01:50:07,828
They must have gone
down over there.

1592
01:50:07,897 --> 01:50:09,228
This is the only way. Let's go.

1593
01:51:05,488 --> 01:51:06,819
Vijay!

1594
01:51:11,361 --> 01:51:13,989
Somebody has fallen over here.

1595
01:51:14,898 --> 01:51:16,160
Please come.

1596
01:51:24,174 --> 01:51:25,505
All this is your deed.

1597
01:51:25,909 --> 01:51:27,843
You always used to call my
son a hooligan, a ruffian..

1598
01:51:27,911 --> 01:51:29,845
..and today there is
a case of murder..

1599
01:51:29,913 --> 01:51:32,177
..filed against that poor boy.

1600
01:51:32,248 --> 01:51:35,445
l know that this accusation of
murder is absolutely false.

1601
01:51:36,186 --> 01:51:37,847
There is lakhs of bad
habits in our Vijay.

1602
01:51:37,921 --> 01:51:39,320
But he cannot do anything
like this.

1603
01:51:39,389 --> 01:51:41,323
l don't want to listen
to your lectures.

1604
01:51:41,391 --> 01:51:45,122
Go right now and by any mean
just bring back my son to me.

1605
01:51:46,329 --> 01:51:48,456
Look, you don't worry.

1606
01:51:48,865 --> 01:51:52,392
l am not only a
professor of law.

1607
01:51:52,869 --> 01:51:56,396
But l know how to find the real
criminal from his secret place.

1608
01:51:56,873 --> 01:51:59,467
Daughter-in-law, pack
my bags for the trip.

1609
01:52:07,016 --> 01:52:09,814
Look Vijay, there are lamps
of Diwali everywhere..

1610
01:52:09,886 --> 01:52:11,877
..in this dark night.

1611
01:52:13,156 --> 01:52:17,149
lt gives rise to a light of
hope in the saddest heart also.

1612
01:52:19,362 --> 01:52:21,353
Then why are you so upset?

1613
01:52:22,298 --> 01:52:24,493
l don't have any light of
hope in my heart, Sunita.

1614
01:52:26,903 --> 01:52:28,837
Because of my own
silly mistakes..

1615
01:52:28,905 --> 01:52:30,839
..l am in the condition
of a scared animal..

1616
01:52:30,907 --> 01:52:32,841
..who is hiding behind the
trees of the forest..

1617
01:52:32,909 --> 01:52:34,171
..to save himself from
the hunter dogs.

1618
01:52:34,244 --> 01:52:36,508
No ..to save himself
from the hunter dogs.

1619
01:52:37,180 --> 01:52:38,340
No Vijay!

1620
01:52:38,415 --> 01:52:39,848
l am right, Sunita.

1621
01:52:40,383 --> 01:52:42,783
Listen. You should
not say like this.

1622
01:52:43,386 --> 01:52:44,785
The whole day, Sunita..

1623
01:52:44,854 --> 01:52:47,379
The whole day l am sacred
about the killers.

1624
01:52:48,858 --> 01:52:52,123
And in the night, l keep seeing
dreams of my hanging.

1625
01:52:53,396 --> 01:52:54,795
Come near me.

1626
01:52:57,467 --> 01:52:58,798
Come more near to me.

1627
01:53:02,872 --> 01:53:05,807
Do you know, Diwali
is a festival..

1628
01:53:05,875 --> 01:53:08,139
..of the triumph of lights
on the darkness?

1629
01:53:09,012 --> 01:53:11,003
lt is the festival of
the success of truth.

1630
01:53:12,148 --> 01:53:14,139
And your own name is Vijay.

1631
01:53:15,485 --> 01:53:18,010
lsn't it?
- Yes, it is.

1632
01:53:18,888 --> 01:53:20,879
Why? Why did you smile now?

1633
01:53:21,224 --> 01:53:22,816
l loved your talks.

1634
01:53:30,433 --> 01:53:31,832
Did you see?

1635
01:53:31,901 --> 01:53:33,835
You took the name of
love and the bugle..

1636
01:53:33,903 --> 01:53:35,894
..is being played far away.
- Yes.

1637
01:53:51,120 --> 01:53:52,781
These poor fishermen
also endanger..

1638
01:53:52,856 --> 01:53:54,118
..their lives day and night.

1639
01:53:54,390 --> 01:53:56,381
They fight against the storms.

1640
01:53:57,861 --> 01:54:00,125
But then too, they are
celebrating tonight.

1641
01:54:01,865 --> 01:54:04,197
Come. Even we will participate
in their celebrations.

1642
01:54:42,839 --> 01:54:45,307

How do l come to meet

We followed him till the
village of Sangli.

But then he disguised himself

Fool! ldiot!

territory also.

How come you are here?

1727
02:05:03,859 --> 02:05:06,327
Yes. You were right.

1728
02:05:06,862 --> 02:05:07,988
Where is Shallu?

1729
02:05:08,063 --> 02:05:09,189
He is in Bombay, father.

1730
02:05:09,265 --> 02:05:10,391
He will come back after
the examinations.

1731
02:05:10,466 --> 02:05:11,797
Greetings, General!

1732
02:05:11,867 --> 02:05:12,993
Greetings!

1733
02:05:13,335 --> 02:05:15,394
You have not answered even one
letter also out of 1 1 letters.

1734
02:05:15,471 --> 02:05:17,462
ls it so? But l did
not get any letter.

1735
02:05:17,873 --> 02:05:20,341
Maybe you must have not pasted
the tickets on the envelope.

1736
02:05:21,343 --> 02:05:23,334
Sunita, who is he?

1737
02:05:24,213 --> 02:05:26,408
Father, actually he is..

1738
02:05:26,482 --> 02:05:27,813
Yes. He is..

1739
02:05:27,883 --> 02:05:29,145
Didn't you recognise him?

1740
02:05:29,418 --> 02:05:30,817
You had seen me
in the childhood.

1741
02:05:30,886 --> 02:05:32,012
How will you remember it now?

1742
02:05:32,087 --> 02:05:33,213
Wait. Wait.

1743
02:05:33,889 --> 02:05:36,483
This piper plane is of Diwan
Mahendranath, isn't it?

1744
02:05:36,892 --> 02:05:37,984
Wow! Wow!

1745
02:05:38,060 --> 02:05:39,357
Did you see? Did you
see? Did you see?

1746
02:05:39,428 --> 02:05:42,420
So you are Dhiru, the son
of Diwan Mahendranath.

1747
02:05:42,831 --> 02:05:43,957
Dhiru?

1748
02:05:44,033 --> 02:05:46,433
Dhiru? Dhiru? Yes, Dhiru.
Yes, he is Dhiru.

1749
02:05:46,835 --> 02:05:48,427
l did not tell him. Father
has himself recognised you.

1750
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:53,364
Hello, operator.

1751
02:05:53,842 --> 02:05:55,776
l want to book a trunk call.

1752
02:05:55,844 --> 02:05:57,106
To Shyamgad.

1753
02:05:57,179 --> 02:05:59,773
ln the happiness of the
arrival of our princess..

1754
02:05:59,848 --> 02:06:04,114
..there is a very royal dinner
in the night. lt is fine.

1755
02:06:05,254 --> 02:06:06,778
But who are you two?

1756
02:06:06,855 --> 02:06:08,254
My name is Balaram.

1757
02:06:08,324 --> 02:06:09,791
And he is Masood.

1758
02:06:09,992 --> 02:06:11,789
We both are waiters.
- New waiters.

1759
02:06:12,261 --> 02:06:13,785
Who has hired them as waiters?

1760
02:06:14,863 --> 02:06:16,330
They seem to be very
strange to me.

1761
02:06:16,398 --> 02:06:17,797
Go away from here.

1762
02:06:17,866 --> 02:06:19,128
Go away?

1763
02:06:19,868 --> 02:06:21,199
Give here. Give it back to me.

1764
02:06:21,270 --> 02:06:23,261
Give it back? What do you want?

1765
02:06:23,339 --> 02:06:24,806
Why don't you speak?

1766
02:06:27,876 --> 02:06:29,002
lt is fine.

1767
02:06:29,078 --> 02:06:30,340
Now work carefully.

1768
02:06:30,412 --> 02:06:31,811
You can go.
- Yes.

1769
02:06:32,881 --> 02:06:34,007
Do you have something else?

1770
02:06:34,083 --> 02:06:35,209
Later on.

1771
02:06:37,886 --> 02:06:40,480
The General's boat went and
sank in the middle of the sea.

1772
02:06:40,823 --> 02:06:44,350
l felt like killing him
after l saw that rascal.

1773
02:06:44,827 --> 02:06:48,354
And that rascal is becoming
eager to kill you right now.

1774
02:06:48,430 --> 02:06:49,761
General, you?

1775
02:06:49,832 --> 02:06:51,766
Where are you going with
two swords in your hand?

1776
02:06:51,834 --> 02:06:53,096
Are you going to
sell it, General?

1777
02:06:53,168 --> 02:06:55,432
No. This sword belongs
to our family.

1778
02:06:55,838 --> 02:06:57,772
That means it belongs to
your after, isn't it?

1779
02:06:57,840 --> 02:06:59,432
General, what is your intention?

1780
02:06:59,842 --> 02:07:02,310
This shameless has attacked
our prestige. - What?

1781
02:07:02,378 --> 02:07:03,777
Be ready for the revenge,
Mister.

1782
02:07:03,846 --> 02:07:05,245
Let it be. Let it be.

1783
02:07:05,314 --> 02:07:07,111
He had just lost his temper.
- Yes.

1784
02:07:07,182 --> 02:07:08,308
Yes. lt was just a light
of matchstick.

1785
02:07:08,384 --> 02:07:09,783
lt burned immediately and
it vanished away easily.

1786
02:07:09,852 --> 02:07:11,183
Stop this nonsense.

1787
02:07:11,253 --> 02:07:12,379
Take this sword and
come in front of me.

1788
02:07:12,454 --> 02:07:14,786
Why are you both behaving
like ruffians?

1789
02:07:14,857 --> 02:07:16,324
Look General, it is
the matter among us.

1790
02:07:16,392 --> 02:07:17,791
We will sit in one corner
and discuss it..

1791
02:07:17,860 --> 02:07:19,794
..with a cool mind
among ourselves.

1792
02:07:19,862 --> 02:07:21,796
We will remove some political
or social solution to it.

1793
02:07:21,864 --> 02:07:23,263
You apologise to me.

1794
02:07:23,332 --> 02:07:24,799
And l will apologise to you.
- Yes. And it will be all over.

1795
02:07:24,867 --> 02:07:25,959
And the matter will be over.

1796
02:07:26,035 --> 02:07:27,195
But first you will
have to fall down..

1797
02:07:27,269 --> 02:07:28,395
..on my feet and apologise.

1798
02:07:28,470 --> 02:07:30,131
l will spare you
only after that.

1799
02:07:31,140 --> 02:07:32,334
Sir, if you will be happy
with this then..

1800
02:07:32,408 --> 02:07:33,807
..look l will fall
down on his feet..

1801
02:07:33,876 --> 02:07:35,810
..and apologise in front
of you. ls it fine?

1802
02:07:35,878 --> 02:07:37,004
No!
- What happened?

1803
02:07:37,079 --> 02:07:38,341
Don't you have any shame?

1804
02:07:38,414 --> 02:07:40,473
Don't you have any self-respect?
- l have a lot of self-respect.

1805
02:07:40,816 --> 02:07:42,750
Self-respect is not lacking.
l have a lot of self-respect.

1806
02:07:42,818 --> 02:07:46,345
But can we remove some
diplomatic solution to this?

1807
02:07:46,822 --> 02:07:48,756
Being a man, are you hiding
behind a woman? - Who?

1808
02:07:48,824 --> 02:07:50,086
Come in front of me?
- Who?

1809
02:07:50,159 --> 02:07:51,285
Who should come in front of you?

1810
02:07:51,360 --> 02:07:52,759
l order you to come in front
of me. - You traitor!

1811
02:07:52,828 --> 02:07:55,228
Leave me. Go ahead and face him.

1812
02:07:55,297 --> 02:07:57,094
Are you scared of him?
- l am not scared of him.

1813
02:07:57,166 --> 02:07:58,758
l am making him feel scared.

1814
02:07:59,301 --> 02:08:00,768
Not over here. Over there.

1815
02:08:03,839 --> 02:08:04,965
Wait. Wait.

1816
02:08:05,174 --> 02:08:08,109
Are you ready?
- Ready. Ready.

1817
02:08:08,977 --> 02:08:10,774
Begin the fight.

1818
02:08:13,849 --> 02:08:14,975
You scoundrel!

1819
02:08:15,050 --> 02:08:16,176
He is a champion.

1820
02:08:18,854 --> 02:08:19,980
Well done, Vijay!

1821
02:08:20,055 --> 02:08:21,181
Well done!

1822
02:08:23,859 --> 02:08:25,793
The lady will be hurt.
The lady will be hurt.

1823
02:08:25,861 --> 02:08:26,987
The lady will be hurt.

1824
02:08:27,062 --> 02:08:28,188

Attack.
- Attack. - Ouch!

1830

Are you fighting with
him or with me?

1831
02:08:39,875 --> 02:08:41,809
Even l cannot understand that
with whom l am fighting?

1832
02:08:41,877 --> 02:08:43,276
He is banging the swords
so quickly. - Yes.

1833
02:08:43,345 --> 02:08:44,812
General.
- Yes. - He is immature.

1834
02:08:44,880 --> 02:08:46,814
Fight slowly with him. Slowly.

1835
02:08:46,882 --> 02:08:49,407
ls it necessary to fight
or is it enough?

1836
02:08:49,485 --> 02:08:51,214
Absolutely! lt is the question
of our respect.

1837
02:08:51,286 --> 02:08:52,412
ls it the question of
our respect? - Yes.

1838
02:08:52,488 --> 02:08:53,819
lf it is the question of our
self-respect then shall we fight..

1839
02:08:53,889 --> 02:08:56,153
..immediately after eating
something in the breakfast?

1840
02:08:56,225 --> 02:08:58,489
No. General.
- Yes. - Attack.

1841
02:08:59,161 --> 02:09:00,822
General, slowly. Slowly.

1842

Did you see?
- Wow! Wow!

1843
02:09:14,510 --> 02:09:15,841
You scoundrel!

Stop coming behind me.

Look over there.

1846
02:09:20,916 --> 02:09:22,440
Very good, Vijay!

1847
02:09:22,518 --> 02:09:23,849
lt is not at all good.

1848
02:09:23,919 --> 02:09:25,181
There that scoundrel is
after my life and..

1849
02:09:25,254 --> 02:09:26,846
..you are sitting peacefully
over here and eating apples.

1850
02:09:28,524 --> 02:09:30,515
You come near a girl
and eat apple.

1851
02:09:30,926 --> 02:09:32,257
You are a coward.

1852
02:09:32,327 --> 02:09:34,386
To gain some strength, General.
To gain some strength.

1853
02:09:35,931 --> 02:09:37,865
Wait over there. l will remove
all your strengths.

1854
02:09:37,933 --> 02:09:39,366
Leave me. Come on.

1855

Take this at least.
- You coward!

1856
02:09:43,872 --> 02:09:44,998
Take care, Vijay!

1857
02:09:47,342 --> 02:09:48,809
O bravo, Vijay! Bravo!

1858
02:09:48,877 --> 02:09:50,003
Bravo!

1859
02:09:50,879 --> 02:09:53,404
You scoundrel! Take this.

You stupid man!

02:09:58,020 --> 02:10:01,353
Keep going ahead,
brave people.

1862
02:10:01,423 --> 02:10:02,822
Go ahead, brave man.

1863
02:10:03,892 --> 02:10:05,018
Stop. Stop.

1864
02:10:05,093 --> 02:10:06,355
You are too tired.
Have some water.

02:10:06,428 --> 02:10:07,827
No water.

1866
02:10:10,899 --> 02:10:12,423
You bloody fool!

1867
02:10:16,905 --> 02:10:18,304
No Vijay. No.

1868
02:10:18,373 --> 02:10:21,831
Not fair. Not fair. Hey!

1869
02:10:22,911 --> 02:10:24,037
Your sleeve is tore.

1870
02:10:24,446 --> 02:10:26,175
Your shirt is also tore.
- No.

1871
02:10:26,448 --> 02:10:28,177
Your pant has also torn.
- No.

1872
02:10:31,920 --> 02:10:33,854
The enemy is running
away, princess.

1873
02:10:33,922 --> 02:10:35,446
The enemy is running away.

1874
02:10:35,924 --> 02:10:38,324
General.
- Yes.

1875
02:10:38,393 --> 02:10:39,860
Don't forget about the party.

1876
02:10:39,928 --> 02:10:43,955
Ok. Ok. Ok.

1877
02:10:45,868 --> 02:10:47,392

Wow! Wow! Very good!

1880
02:10:52,207 --> 02:10:53,333
You have proved to be
a master in swords.

1881
02:10:53,408 --> 02:10:54,807
Where have l proven
to be a master?

1882
02:10:54,877 --> 02:10:57,277
Even you had thrown me away
to face that wild buffalo.

1883
02:10:57,346 --> 02:10:58,813
l was telling no. No. No.

1884
02:10:58,881 --> 02:11:01,213
But attack. Attack. Keep

02:11:05,888 --> 02:11:07,014
So l have tested it.

So have l passed or failed?

Really?
- Yes.

1894
02:11:21,904 --> 02:11:23,895
There is no need to
become so romantic.

1895
02:11:24,506 --> 02:11:25,837
What did you say?

1896
02:11:25,908 --> 02:11:28,308
There is no need to
become so romantic.

1897
02:11:28,911 --> 02:11:30,845
Shall we leave?
- Let's go. Let's go.

1898
02:11:47,329 --> 02:11:48,796
What had l told you donkey?
Keep an eye on him.

1899
02:11:48,864 --> 02:11:49,990
Where is he?

1900
02:11:50,198 --> 02:11:51,790
He is romancing along with the
princess in the garden..

1901
02:11:51,867 --> 02:11:54,131
..and bringing fame to
the name of our family.

1902
02:11:54,202 --> 02:11:55,328
Go and have a look.

1903
02:11:55,404 --> 02:11:57,338
Why didn't you pull his
ears and slap him?

1904
02:11:57,406 --> 02:11:59,465
Shall l go and slap him? Shall
l give him a tight slap?

1905
02:11:59,875 --> 02:12:01,137
Will you slap on your head?

1906
02:12:01,410 --> 02:12:02,809
He is coming here.

1907
02:12:03,412 --> 02:12:04,811
We have taken so much time.

1908
02:12:04,880 --> 02:12:07,212
What will we tell father?
- We will make any silly excuse.

1909
02:12:07,416 --> 02:12:08,815
He is coming.
- Who?

1910
02:12:08,884 --> 02:12:11,478
Hello, your Highness!
- Hello Dhiru!

1911
02:12:11,887 --> 02:12:13,354
Where were you both
from so long?

1912
02:12:13,422 --> 02:12:15,822
Your Highness, we had
gone over there..

1913
02:12:15,891 --> 02:12:17,153
What is its name?

1914
02:12:17,225 --> 02:12:19,352
Mushy park. Mushy park.
- Mushy park. Mushy park.

1915
02:12:19,428 --> 02:12:20,827
So many English men
had gone inside it..

1916
02:12:20,896 --> 02:12:22,227
..during the partition.

1917
02:12:22,297 --> 02:12:23,821
But none of them came outside.

1918
02:12:23,899 --> 02:12:25,890
Even one man came out,
your Highness.

1919
02:12:26,168 --> 02:12:28,159
Then it is good that
we both came back.

1920
02:12:28,236 --> 02:12:29,828
Otherwise my poor father
would have said that..

1921
02:12:29,905 --> 02:12:31,839
..my alone child Dhiru,
where has he gone?

1922
02:12:31,907 --> 02:12:33,169
Where did he vanish?

1923
02:12:33,442 --> 02:12:34,841
He wouldn't have told
you anything.

1924
02:12:34,910 --> 02:12:36,434
lt would have threatened
my life.

1925
02:12:36,912 --> 02:12:38,174
Go and meet him.

1926
02:12:38,246 --> 02:12:39,838
He is somewhere over here only.
- Who?

1927
02:12:41,383 --> 02:12:42,782
Diwan Mahendranath.

1928
02:12:43,852 --> 02:12:47,447
Diwan.. No. Your Highness,
you are joking.

1929
02:12:47,856 --> 02:12:52,452
He has gone away to Delhi to
see the cricket test match.

1930
02:12:52,861 --> 02:12:54,852
What are you telling? Delhi?

1931
02:12:55,130 --> 02:12:56,324
Look over there.

1932
02:12:56,398 --> 02:12:57,797
ln the front. He is
looking at you only.

1933
02:12:57,866 --> 02:13:00,391
How can he come over here?

1934
02:13:01,136 --> 02:13:02,330
Look over there. lt is he only.

1935
02:13:02,404 --> 02:13:05,134

Daddy. Daddy, greetings!

You are very smart!

Excuse me, daddy. l made a
mistake in a hurry, daddy.

Please leave.

1946
02:13:30,499 --> 02:13:31,830
Daddy, please forgive me.

1947
02:13:31,900 --> 02:13:33,834
l did not take your permission.

1948
02:13:33,902 --> 02:13:35,028
Excuse me, please.

1949
02:13:35,103 --> 02:13:36,297
What fault have you done?

1950
02:13:36,371 --> 02:13:39,340
Child Dhiru, shake hands.

1951
02:13:40,442 --> 02:13:42,433
Hello! Hello daddy!

1952
02:13:42,844 --> 02:13:44,243
Where is mummy? Where is mummy?

1953

Mummy is waiting for
you at home. - Drink?

1954
02:13:47,849 --> 02:13:50,317
Sir, l have told you that
please let me talk to my daddy.

1955
02:13:50,385 --> 02:13:53,445
Why are you interfering again
and again by offering drinks?

1956
02:13:53,855 --> 02:13:55,117
l am sorry.

1957
02:13:56,858 --> 02:14:00,316
Fine then l will go and meet
my mummy and come back.

1958
02:14:00,395 --> 02:14:01,794
Daddy, bye-bye.

1959
02:14:01,863 --> 02:14:03,797
Wait. Don't spoil the party.

1960
02:14:03,865 --> 02:14:04,991
Come with me.

1961
02:14:05,067 --> 02:14:06,796
Waiter, scotch.

Cheers!

1963
02:14:09,471 --> 02:14:11,462
Daddy, l have stopped
it from three years.

1964
02:14:11,873 --> 02:14:13,135
There is a prohibition
in Bombay, isn't it?

1965
02:14:13,208 --> 02:14:15,403
There is a prohibition.
- This is not Bombay.

1966
02:14:15,477 --> 02:14:17,809
This isn't Bombay? So daddy,
l will do one work.

1967
02:14:17,879 --> 02:14:19,346
l will drink the red and
sour tomato juice.

1968
02:14:19,414 --> 02:14:20,813
The red and sour one.

1969
02:14:20,882 --> 02:14:22,816
My son doesn't drinks
tomato juice.

1970
02:14:22,884 --> 02:14:25,148
He drinks scotch and he
drinks it in front of me.

1971
02:14:25,420 --> 02:14:26,819
ls your son so disobedient?

1972
02:14:26,888 --> 02:14:28,321
He is very disobedient.

Can't you see?

1976
02:14:37,365 --> 02:14:39,492
You would have spoiled the
entire suit of my daddy now?

1977
02:14:39,901 --> 02:14:41,766
You keep such big beard and
moustache and you see but..

1978
02:14:41,837 --> 02:14:43,771
..then too you don't have any
sense. - What did you say?

1979
02:14:43,839 --> 02:14:45,773
Yes. What? Are you scaring me?

1980
02:14:45,841 --> 02:14:47,365
l will tell the king.
l will tell him.

1981
02:14:47,442 --> 02:14:48,773
Where is that king gone?

1982
02:14:49,111 --> 02:14:50,271
Where is that king?

1983
02:14:50,345 --> 02:14:52,438
Excuse me! Sorry. Sorry.
- lts all right.

1984
02:14:52,981 --> 02:14:54,312
Take this. Cheers!

1985
02:14:55,851 --> 02:14:57,785
Daddy, l will lose control
after drinking.

1986
02:14:57,853 --> 02:15:00,117
And l will say something
wrong, daddy.

1987
02:15:00,455 --> 02:15:03,117
And if l will say something
wrong then?

1988
02:15:03,291 --> 02:15:04,781
Daddy, please.

1989
02:15:05,193 --> 02:15:06,785
Look, if we will drink
alcohol then..

1990
02:15:06,862 --> 02:15:08,329
..mummy will get angry with us.

1991
02:15:08,396 --> 02:15:11,160
Your mummy also drinks
alcohol, darling.

1992
02:15:11,233 --> 02:15:12,325
Drink it.

1993
02:15:12,400 --> 02:15:14,459
Does my mummy drink alcohol?
- Yes.

1994
02:15:14,870 --> 02:15:17,304
Cheers!

1995
02:15:18,206 --> 02:15:20,333

Cheers!

For mummy. For daddy.

1998
02:15:26,882 --> 02:15:28,213
Cheers!

1999
02:15:32,420 --> 02:15:33,819
Cheers!

2000
02:15:36,358 --> 02:15:38,349
Now l understand something
about Diwan.

2001
02:15:39,895 --> 02:15:42,420
Daddy.
- Not daddy. Call me Balaram.

2002
02:15:44,299 --> 02:15:45,766
Daddy.
- Yes.

2003
02:15:45,834 --> 02:15:47,768
Daddy, you are great!

2004
02:15:47,836 --> 02:15:49,827
You are great, daddy!
You are great!

2005
02:15:51,306 --> 02:15:53,774
You must not praise
a human being but..

2006
02:15:53,842 --> 02:15:56,106
..you must praise the Lord, son.

2007
02:15:56,378 --> 02:15:58,175
There is lord up
above over there.

2008
02:15:58,246 --> 02:16:00,237
And a generous man is over here.

2009
02:16:00,315 --> 02:16:03,113
Today you have saved me daddy.

2010
02:16:03,185 --> 02:16:06,120
Otherwise the king would
have thrown me out.

2011
02:16:06,288 --> 02:16:08,279
He would have told
me that scoundrel..

2012
02:16:08,857 --> 02:16:10,984
Stop this nonsense.
- Daddy. Daddy.

2013
02:16:11,059 --> 02:16:13,391
Otherwise you will be handed
over to the police.

2014
02:16:13,461 --> 02:16:15,986
Daddy, are you angry with me?

2015
02:16:16,064 --> 02:16:18,123
Daddy, are you angry with me?

2016
02:16:19,134 --> 02:16:21,466
This is not anger.
This is friendship.

2017
02:16:21,870 --> 02:16:24,395
You have become my friend.
You have become my friend.

2018
02:16:24,873 --> 02:16:26,204
Take, drink this.

2019
02:16:26,875 --> 02:16:28,809
You make me drink it
with your own hands.

2020
02:16:46,828 --> 02:16:50,286
Daddy. Daddy.

2021
02:16:50,365 --> 02:16:51,764
What happened?

2022
02:16:51,833 --> 02:16:54,097
Daddy, look over there.

2023
02:16:54,302 --> 02:16:56,429
Look, everybody is
waiting over there.

2024
02:16:56,838 --> 02:16:58,100
Where are they?

2025
02:16:58,840 --> 02:17:01,274
Those killers over there.

2026
02:17:03,111 --> 02:17:04,305
Sir, look over there.

2027
02:17:04,379 --> 02:17:05,778
The one who is standing
over there.

2028
02:17:07,849 --> 02:17:09,783
They are murderer people who
are behind me to kill me.

2029
02:17:09,851 --> 02:17:13,309
He wants to kill me.
- All this is a misconception?

2030
02:17:23,398 --> 02:17:24,797
Daddy..

2031
02:17:24,866 --> 02:17:26,299
See.. see..
- Garga..

2032
02:17:28,136 --> 02:17:31,469
You have drunk a lot. lt is
time for you to sleep now.

2033
02:17:31,873 --> 02:17:36,207
Daddy.. daddy.. daddy..

2034

02:18:03,838 --> 02:18:05,772
What is this? You have drunk.

2036
02:18:06,841 --> 02:18:09,366
You are stinking.

2037
02:18:31,399 --> 02:18:32,798
Has he drunk a lot?

2038
02:18:35,870 --> 02:18:37,132
What does it mean?

2039
02:18:37,205 --> 02:18:38,331
Bearer..

2040
02:18:40,875 --> 02:18:42,001
Yes?

2041
02:18:42,344 --> 02:18:44,403
Take him away. Take him away.

2042
02:19:37,932 --> 02:19:46,135
Oh people.. don't think
me to be a drunkard.

2043
02:19:47,008 --> 02:19:54,414
l haven't drunk, l have
been made to drink.

2044
02:19:54,983 --> 02:20:01,286
Wherever the feet
wander in love..

2045
02:20:01,356 --> 02:20:07,989
l have been shown that path.

2046
02:20:21,242 --> 02:20:27,340
l am intoxicated,
but l now it..

2047
02:20:27,916 --> 02:20:33,855
Everyone is drinking
in this world.

2048
02:20:34,255 --> 02:20:40,387
Someone has got
dripping pegs..

2049
02:20:40,862 --> 02:20:46,801
Someone has been made to
drink with the eyes.

2050
02:20:47,202 --> 02:20:53,402
O people of the world,
don't regard me a drunkard.

2051
02:20:53,875 --> 02:21:01,145
l really don't drink;
but l've been made to drink.

2052
02:21:13,895 --> 02:21:19,492
Someone has the intoxication
of happiness in this world.

2053
02:21:20,301 --> 02:21:26,433
Someone is intoxicated in
the sorrow of this world.

2054
02:21:26,908 --> 02:21:33,313
Someone is drinking
the blood of humans.

2055
02:21:33,381 --> 02:21:39,445
There is excitement
in everyone's heart.

2056
02:21:39,921 --> 02:21:46,121
O people of the world,
don't regard me a drunkard.

2057
02:21:46,261 --> 02:21:52,791
l really don't drink; but
l've been made to drink.

2058
02:22:09,150 --> 02:22:15,419
The world.. my friends..
has different ways.

2059
02:22:15,890 --> 02:22:22,022
The bodies shine here,
but the minds are black.

2060
02:22:22,230 --> 02:22:28,829
This is the world.

2061
02:22:28,903 --> 02:22:35,433
The black hearts have been
hidden in glorious bodies.

2062
02:22:35,910 --> 02:22:42,179
O people of the world,
don't regard me a drunkard.

2063
02:22:42,250 --> 02:22:48,382
l really don't drink;
but l've been made to drink.

2064
02:22:48,856 --> 02:22:55,125
Wherein my movements strayed.

2065
02:22:55,863 --> 02:23:01,392
l was indeed shown the same way.

2066
02:23:32,900 --> 02:23:35,164
Daddy, please listen to
me. He is not wrong.

2067
02:23:36,037 --> 02:23:37,834
You don't understand, Sunita.

2068
02:23:38,172 --> 02:23:39,833
These things are
not to be hidden.

2069
02:23:40,174 --> 02:23:43,268
We will have to telephone

2070
02:23:44,112 --> 02:23:45,773
There isn't any time to
think about it, Garga.

2071
02:23:47,115 --> 02:23:49,106
He is dead drunk
and unconscious.

Sir.. l was against blood

man? What proof..

l was searching for the real
killers of the Acharya.

2101

Are you crazy? Who
is a killer here?

lt is you.

2103
02:26:17,865 --> 02:26:18,991
What proof do you have?

Gafoor..
- Yes, sir. Tell me.

Did you listen to that,

Stop your nonsense.
What drama is this?

2115

We have made this drama
to unveil your truth.

2116

You wanted to commit a
murder and trap my son?

02:26:59,841 --> 02:27:01,775
Did you think that
Vijay is an orphan?

What did you think?
He has nobody?

2120
02:27:04,846 --> 02:27:07,110
Not Walaram. Mr. Khanna.

Hands up..

Don't give it to him. Don't
give him that recorder.

2124
02:28:07,441 --> 02:28:08,772
Give it, Vijay.

2125
02:28:08,843 --> 02:28:10,105
Here you are dad.

2126
02:28:11,379 --> 02:28:12,778
Give me the recorder.

02:28:53,087 --> 02:28:55,419
They are after me. Hide this
tape recorder somewhere.

2134
02:28:55,489 --> 02:28:56,820
What is there in this?

Give me this tape recorder.

l won't give it yto you.

2139
02:29:49,877 --> 02:29:51,811
Sunita..
- Father..

2140

Sunita.

02:30:14,502 --> 02:30:15,833
Where is it?

2142
02:30:16,170 --> 02:30:17,831
Where is the recorded tape?

2143
02:30:19,373 --> 02:30:21,432
l ask you.. where is
the recorded tape?

2144

l will never tell you.

2145
02:30:22,910 --> 02:30:24,844
l won't tell you even
if you kill me.

2146
02:30:24,912 --> 02:30:26,243
Get away from our path,
you illiterate.

2147
02:30:26,313 --> 02:30:27,439
Tell me where the tape is.

2148
02:30:27,515 --> 02:30:28,846
l won't betray my Vijay.

2149
02:30:28,916 --> 02:30:30,850
l will die but l won't tell
you where the tape is.

2150
02:30:30,918 --> 02:30:34,183
Tell me..
- No. l won't tell you.

2151
02:30:36,190 --> 02:30:38,454
This is lies, l didn't
commit any murder.

2152
02:30:38,526 --> 02:30:39,857
l am innocent.

2153
02:30:39,927 --> 02:30:41,792
lf you are innocent, why were
you running from the police?

2154
02:30:41,862 --> 02:30:43,261
Why did you enter the city
under a false name?

2155
02:30:43,330 --> 02:30:45,264
You rogue. You will have
to accept your crime.

2156
02:30:45,332 --> 02:30:47,129
l didn't commit any crime, sir.

2157
02:30:47,201 --> 02:30:48,395
You had this pistol
in your hand.

2158
02:30:48,469 --> 02:30:49,800
You were standing
by his dead body.

2159
02:30:49,870 --> 02:30:51,269
But l didn't kill him.

2160
02:30:51,338 --> 02:30:53,135
lf you didn't kill him, who did?

2161
02:30:53,207 --> 02:30:56,142
Diwan Mahendranath and his
friends have killed him.

2162
02:30:56,210 --> 02:30:59,202
Garga had shot him. l have
seen it.. - This is lies.

2163
02:30:59,280 --> 02:31:00,406
This is the truth.

2164
02:31:00,481 --> 02:31:02,472
The princess Sunita
has it's proof.

2165
02:31:02,883 --> 02:31:06,011
Where is the princess?
- The princess is in the palace.

2166
02:31:06,087 --> 02:31:07,281
The princess is not
in the palace.

2167
02:31:07,354 --> 02:31:09,481
Nobody knows her whereabouts.
- You have made her disappear.

2168
02:31:09,890 --> 02:31:12,154
Why are you being an enemy
of your own life?

2169
02:31:12,893 --> 02:31:16,158
You are a princess. He
is a worthless man.

2170
02:31:17,031 --> 02:31:22,162
A thousand men like this are
trampled like worms in a day.

2171
02:31:22,236 --> 02:31:23,362
Sir. Look at this.

2172
02:31:23,437 --> 02:31:25,371
He has printed our names
in the newspapers too.

2173
02:31:25,439 --> 02:31:27,304
Who will ask about us
in the elections?

2174
02:31:27,374 --> 02:31:28,841
Sunita, l tell you once again.

2175
02:31:29,176 --> 02:31:31,508
Take your hands away
from our collar.

2176
02:31:31,912 --> 02:31:34,176
Otherwise, we will
cut this hand.

2177
02:31:35,182 --> 02:31:36,342
Garga..

2178
02:31:43,390 --> 02:31:45,449
No.. no..

2179
02:31:47,862 --> 02:31:49,796
Tell me where the tape is.

2180
02:31:50,331 --> 02:31:51,457
Garga..

2181
02:31:55,870 --> 02:31:58,134
Sunita is in our hands.

2182
02:31:58,873 --> 02:32:02,138
lf you open your mouth in
the court against us.

2183
02:32:02,476 --> 02:32:05,309
Her death will be in your name.

2184
02:32:06,147 --> 02:32:10,140
You wretch. Go away from
here, you wretch.

2185
02:32:16,891 --> 02:32:19,416
The court asks you
for the last time.

2186
02:32:19,493 --> 02:32:22,155
Do you accept your crime?

2187
02:32:29,436 --> 02:32:32,428
lf you open your mouth in
the court against us.

2188
02:32:33,307 --> 02:32:35,502
Her death will be in your name.

2189
02:32:38,445 --> 02:32:41,437
Vijay Khanna. What is the
meaning of your silence?

2190
02:32:41,849 --> 02:32:44,113
The silence of the
accused gives..

2191
02:32:44,185 --> 02:32:47,120
..proof that the accused
has killed the Acharya.

2192
02:32:47,321 --> 02:32:49,186
l request you.

2193
02:32:49,256 --> 02:32:51,781
Under the lndian
Penal Code 302..

2194
02:32:51,859 --> 02:32:56,125
..this coward murderer should
be sentenced to death.

2195
02:32:56,197 --> 02:32:59,394
This is lies. These
accusations are lies.

2196
02:32:59,867 --> 02:33:01,801
My son is innocent.

2197
02:33:02,136 --> 02:33:03,797
Acharya's killers..

2198
02:33:03,871 --> 02:33:06,271
..are the Diwan Mahendranath
and his allies.

2199
02:33:06,340 --> 02:33:09,400
Son, why don't you say
that you are innocent?

2200
02:33:09,877 --> 02:33:11,811
Tell it, son. Please tell it.

2201
02:33:12,146 --> 02:33:13,306
Take him out.

2202
02:33:13,380 --> 02:33:16,474
No.. no.. my son is innocent.

2203
02:33:16,884 --> 02:33:19,478
You people don't have a right
to kill a innocent man.

2204
02:33:19,887 --> 02:33:21,821
This is not justice.
lt is injustice.

2205
02:33:21,889 --> 02:33:26,292
My son is innocent. My
son is innocent, sir.

2206
02:33:27,494 --> 02:33:28,825
Vijay..

2207
02:33:28,896 --> 02:33:31,160
Don't bow your head
to these killers.

2208
02:33:32,900 --> 02:33:35,425
l have bowed my head, father.

2209
02:33:36,503 --> 02:33:38,494
To save my life..

2210
02:33:39,240 --> 02:33:41,231
l cannot sacrifice
Sunita's life.

2211
02:33:41,308 --> 02:33:44,106
You think that they will
spare Sunita after you?

2212
02:33:44,445 --> 02:33:46,436
Sunita is our daughter-in-law.

2213
02:33:46,847 --> 02:33:49,441
The two of us wish to
see your love fruitful.

2214
02:33:49,984 --> 02:33:51,110
Yes, son.

2215
02:33:51,185 --> 02:33:53,449
Can't you give us even
so much happiness?

2216
02:33:53,854 --> 02:33:55,321
Please don't talk to
me like this, mother.

2217
02:33:55,389 --> 02:33:58,290
l cannot give you anything.
Nothing..

2218
02:33:58,993 --> 02:34:01,461
Why cannot you give it to us?
Am l not your mother?

2219
02:34:01,862 --> 02:34:05,389
Have l not given birth to you?
Did l not look after you?

2220
02:34:05,466 --> 02:34:10,335
Vijay. Pay me for my
love and service.

2221
02:34:10,404 --> 02:34:11,803
Give me my daughter-in-law.

2222
02:34:11,872 --> 02:34:13,339
Have her released from
those murderers.

2223
02:34:13,407 --> 02:34:17,343
Or else, l won't forgive even a
drop of my milk to you. Vijay..

2224
02:34:17,411 --> 02:34:20,403
Mother.. mother..
what should l do?

2225
02:34:23,417 --> 02:34:26,147
What should l do?
- My son..

2226
02:34:27,221 --> 02:34:28,415
l'm unable to understand anything.

2227
02:34:30,891 --> 02:34:32,825
Don't cry. Don't cry, son.

2228
02:34:34,895 --> 02:34:38,353
Vijay. Keep this Gita with you.

2229
02:34:39,166 --> 02:34:41,430
lt will take you on
the path of truth.

2230
02:34:42,836 --> 02:34:43,962
Come on, Vijay's mother.

2231
02:34:44,038 --> 02:34:45,300
Come on, mother.

2232
02:34:45,839 --> 02:34:46,965
Come on.

No..

2237
02:36:10,391 --> 02:36:12,120
Garga..
- Who is it?

2238
02:36:12,259 --> 02:36:13,317
Who is it?

2239
02:36:13,394 --> 02:36:15,794
Vijay Khanna is here.

2240
02:36:16,864 --> 02:36:18,126
Vijay Khanna.

2241
02:36:18,866 --> 02:36:20,857
Give me the tape. Give it to me.

2242
02:36:21,402 --> 02:36:23,461
First you send these people
out and close the door.

2243
02:36:24,138 --> 02:36:25,298
Go.

2244
02:36:29,476 --> 02:36:31,273
No. Vijay. No.

2245
02:36:31,345 --> 02:36:32,403
Give it. Give the tape.

2246
02:36:32,479 --> 02:36:34,140
No.. no..

2247
02:36:50,097 --> 02:36:51,359
No.. no..

2248
02:37:13,120 --> 02:37:17,284
Sunita.. Sunita.. no.. no..

2249
02:37:37,878 --> 02:37:40,403
Fie on Vijay Khanna.

2250
02:37:47,821 --> 02:37:49,083
The enemy of the country.

2251
02:37:49,156 --> 02:37:50,748
Fie on Vijay Khanna.

2252
02:37:50,824 --> 02:37:52,086
We promise the country..

2253
02:37:52,159 --> 02:37:57,256
That we will trample all
Ravanas like Vijay Khanna.

2254
02:38:03,837 --> 02:38:09,298
Your vote is the call of
death for these sinners.

2255
02:38:10,844 --> 02:38:12,778
Your vote is the
message of life..

2256
02:38:12,846 --> 02:38:16,942
..for the high concepts
of Janata Sevak Sangh.

2257
02:38:21,455 --> 02:38:22,786
Hail..

2258
02:38:24,324 --> 02:38:26,121
Hail revolution.

2259
02:38:33,467 --> 02:38:38,131
What is this? Lights.. lights..
electrician..

2260
02:38:38,472 --> 02:38:43,136
Don't worry, Ghatak. This is
the darkness of your sins.

2261
02:38:43,277 --> 02:38:44,403
No..

2262
02:38:44,878 --> 02:38:46,402
What is this going on?

2263
02:38:46,880 --> 02:38:48,814
You betrayers cannot
put the tradition..

2264
02:38:48,882 --> 02:38:52,409
..of this country in the
pockets of these rich people.

2265
02:38:52,886 --> 02:38:55,286
Who is this rogue?
Whose voice is it?

2266
02:38:55,489 --> 02:38:57,423
Electrician, put the lights on.

2267
02:38:57,491 --> 02:38:59,823
Diwan, this is the voice
of that innocent man..

2268
02:38:59,893 --> 02:39:03,420
..whose clothes you wished to
blot with your accusations.

2269
02:39:04,331 --> 02:39:06,356
This is the voice
of Vijay Khanna.

2270
02:39:06,900 --> 02:39:09,494
Whom the world thinks to be
the killer of the Acharya.

2271
02:39:13,507 --> 02:39:15,839
Killer.. killer.. killer..

2272
02:39:28,255 --> 02:39:29,381
Vijay Khanna.

2273
02:39:29,456 --> 02:39:32,516
The police bullets have
surrounded you from four sides.

2274
02:39:32,926 --> 02:39:36,020
lt is impossible for
you to come out.

2275
02:39:36,263 --> 02:39:39,198
Give yourself up to the
police straight away.

2276
02:39:39,399 --> 02:39:42,334
Pump all your bullets
into my chest.

2277
02:39:42,402 --> 02:39:46,463
Give my dead body to the feet
of my thousands of brothers.

2278
02:39:46,873 --> 02:39:49,808
But l will snatch the
mask of honesty..

2279
02:39:49,876 --> 02:39:54,210
..from the faces
of these sinners.

2280
02:39:54,348 --> 02:39:55,815
And l prove to all my brothers..

2281
02:39:55,882 --> 02:39:57,816
..to take the rule
in their hands..

2282
02:39:57,884 --> 02:39:59,818
..and to win this election..

2283
02:39:59,886 --> 02:40:04,289
..these people have
killed the Acharya.

2284
02:40:04,358 --> 02:40:06,826
Lies.. killer..

2285
02:40:11,431 --> 02:40:12,830
The police will have to
take the dead bodies..

2286
02:40:12,899 --> 02:40:15,163
..of these killers with me.

2287
02:40:15,369 --> 02:40:16,836
Your vulgar antics
prove that you..

2288
02:40:16,903 --> 02:40:21,306
..don't have any qualms
before killing anyone.

2289
02:40:21,441 --> 02:40:24,171
This proves that you have
killed the Acharya.

2290
02:40:24,244 --> 02:40:27,509
And you must surely have killed
the princess Sunita too.

2291
02:40:27,914 --> 02:40:29,848
Don't accuse me of
the murder of..

2292
02:40:29,916 --> 02:40:32,976
..the Acharya. Accuse your
betrayer friends of it.

2293
02:40:33,053 --> 02:40:35,180
What proof do you have
of this accusation?

2294
02:40:35,255 --> 02:40:36,449
What proof do you have?

2295
02:40:36,523 --> 02:40:38,184
l am the proof.

2296
02:40:38,925 --> 02:40:42,258
The people who are folding
hands and asking votes from you..

2297
02:40:42,329 --> 02:40:44,456
They are fooling the
whole country.

2298
02:40:44,865 --> 02:40:49,268
l had the proof of their hand
in the Acharya's death.

2299
02:40:49,336 --> 02:40:53,272
But these killers took me away
from the palace forcibly.

2300
02:40:54,341 --> 02:40:55,808
The threatened to kill
me and forced..

2301
02:40:55,876 --> 02:41:00,336
..Vijay Khanna to keep
silent in court.

2302
02:41:01,882 --> 02:41:05,409
ls their wretchedness strong,
or the justice of the people?

2303
02:41:06,887 --> 02:41:08,354
You have to decide it.

2304
02:41:08,422 --> 02:41:09,821
Princess.

2305
02:41:09,890 --> 02:41:11,824
For the ambitions
of your heart..

2306
02:41:11,892 --> 02:41:15,487
..for your lust and ambitions
you can kill humanity.

2307
02:41:16,029 --> 02:41:18,497
But you cannot see the dead
face of your lover.

2308
02:41:18,899 --> 02:41:21,493
What do you think?
The court is blind?

2309
02:41:21,902 --> 02:41:24,302
Or is the public blind?

2310
02:41:24,371 --> 02:41:28,171
Neither the people nor the
law of the land are blind.

2311
02:41:28,375 --> 02:41:30,366
These slaves to selfishness
are blind.

2312
02:41:30,911 --> 02:41:32,845
They think that they
can put the..

2313
02:41:32,913 --> 02:41:35,313
..principles of this country
in their pockets.

2314
02:41:35,515 --> 02:41:37,847
They think that they can buy
the dignity of this country and..

2315
02:41:37,918 --> 02:41:41,285
..the respect of the crores of
countrymen with their wealth.

2316
02:41:41,855 --> 02:41:43,447
But they will not win.

2317
02:41:44,124 --> 02:41:45,785
The public will win.

2318
02:41:45,992 --> 02:41:49,120
These lies won't win.
Truth will win.

2319
02:41:49,463 --> 02:41:50,794
These murderers will not win.

2320
02:41:50,864 --> 02:41:53,332
The blood of these
innocents will win.

2321
02:41:53,400 --> 02:41:54,799
The lightning of revolution..

2322
02:41:54,868 --> 02:41:59,134
..will wipe away these
selfish people.

2323
02:41:59,406 --> 02:42:02,807
The mountains of gold
and silver will break..

2324
02:42:02,876 --> 02:42:05,344
..and they won't be
seen till afar.

2325
02:42:05,412 --> 02:42:08,404
What will be seen is the smiles
of our coming generations.

2326
02:42:08,882 --> 02:42:11,476
Their marching ahead footsteps.

2327
02:42:11,885 --> 02:42:14,479
What will be seen is
this tricolored flag.

2328
02:42:17,891 --> 02:42:18,983
Undoubtedly..

2329
02:42:19,059 --> 02:42:23,155
Undoubtedly you brothers
will not believe me.

2330
02:42:23,230 --> 02:42:24,356
Undoubtedly, you won't believe..

2331
02:42:24,431 --> 02:42:26,422
..in the love filled heart
of princess Sunita too.

2332
02:42:26,500 --> 02:42:30,834
But these fake gods of justice
and integrity.. For once..

2333
02:42:30,904 --> 02:42:34,431
Just once listen to their
voice with your own ears.

2334
02:42:35,175 --> 02:42:37,837
l leave the decision
of my justice to you.

2335
02:42:37,911 --> 02:42:39,845
Whatever punishment
you decide for me..

2336
02:42:39,913 --> 02:42:41,244
That will be acceptable to me.

2337
02:42:41,314 --> 02:42:43,441
This wretched sinner's
farce is over now.

2338
02:42:44,384 --> 02:42:47,114
This rogue cannot fool
the public any longer.

2339
02:42:48,855 --> 02:42:50,789
Anupam Rao Khatak.

2340
02:42:52,859 --> 02:42:54,793
Janta Sevak Sangh..

2341
02:42:56,329 --> 02:42:57,796
Anupan Rao Khatak.

2342
02:42:59,466 --> 02:43:00,797
Janata Sevak Sangh.

2343
02:43:03,336 --> 02:43:05,463
This is not a meeting.
This is a joke.

2344
02:43:05,872 --> 02:43:07,134
Come, Mr. Khatak.

2345
02:43:07,874 --> 02:43:09,933
Please wait for a little
while more, Mr. Diwan.

2346
02:43:10,010 --> 02:43:11,204
Friends..

2347
02:43:11,878 --> 02:43:13,812
The recorded tape of
the conversation..

2348
02:43:13,880 --> 02:43:15,814
..of the famous personality
of the city..

2349
02:43:15,882 --> 02:43:17,816
..Mr. Mahendranath Diwan,
is placed..

2350
02:43:17,884 --> 02:43:21,149
..in the court of
the public by us.

2351
02:43:21,354 --> 02:43:25,814
Please listen to this and
decide who the criminal is.

2352
02:43:27,894 --> 02:43:29,828
What proof does
the police have..

2353
02:43:29,896 --> 02:43:32,160
..that Garga is our
man? What proof..

2354
02:43:32,232 --> 02:43:34,826
..do they have that
l had given money..

2355
02:43:34,901 --> 02:43:37,836
..to have Acharya killed?

2356
02:43:37,904 --> 02:43:39,496
You be rest assured.

2357
02:43:39,906 --> 02:43:41,771
l will tolerate everything.

2358
02:43:41,842 --> 02:43:43,275
The enemies of the country..

2359
02:43:43,343 --> 02:43:44,776
Fie on them..

2360
02:43:44,845 --> 02:43:46,107
The enemies of the country..

2361
02:43:46,179 --> 02:43:51,776
Fie on them..

2362
02:43:54,955 --> 02:43:56,946
Let me go. l am innocent.

2363
02:43:57,023 --> 02:43:59,048
The Diwan killed the Acharya.

2364
02:44:00,393 --> 02:44:01,792
Give me this gun.

2365
02:44:02,462 --> 02:44:04,123
Don't you dare.

2366
02:44:04,865 --> 02:44:07,129
lf anyone comes to me,
l will shoot him.

2367
02:44:07,300 --> 02:44:08,790
Get away.

2368
02:44:14,407 --> 02:44:17,308
All the bullets of the pistol
were fake, Mr. Diwan.

2369
02:44:18,879 --> 02:44:20,813
Hit him! Hit him!

2370
02:45:04,257 --> 02:45:08,193
Accept your crime. Or we will
make pieces out of you.

2371
02:45:08,261 --> 02:45:13,460
You cannot hurt me. l didn't
commit any crime.

2372
02:45:14,134 --> 02:45:16,125
And l won't accept any crime.

2373
02:45:16,336 --> 02:45:18,804
He won't accept it like
this. Burn him.

2374
02:45:19,139 --> 02:45:20,800
You cannot hurt me.

2375
02:45:20,874 --> 02:45:22,341
Burn him with the Ravana.

2376
02:45:22,409 --> 02:45:24,468
You cannot take the
law in your hands.

2377
02:45:26,880 --> 02:45:28,814
Stop him.. Stop him..

2378
02:45:30,417 --> 02:45:32,885
Don't let him set afire.
l tell you. Stop him.

2379
02:45:37,891 --> 02:45:39,825
Help me.. help me..

2380
02:45:39,893 --> 02:45:41,758
l had the Acharya killed.

2381
02:45:41,828 --> 02:45:44,092
Vijay Khanna is innocent.

2382
02:45:44,164 --> 02:45:47,759
Burn him!

2383
02:46:02,315 --> 02:46:04,783
We are the youth
of the country..

2384
02:46:04,851 --> 02:46:07,786
'The one who clashes with us.

2385
02:46:07,854 --> 02:46:10,379
The one who clashes with us.

2386
02:46:10,457 --> 02:46:15,793
He will be kicked in the
dust due to our kicks.

2387
02:46:15,862 --> 02:46:18,456
And, will get buried in the ground.

2388
02:46:18,865 --> 02:46:24,394
The injustice will drown
in the sea of time.

2389
02:46:24,471 --> 02:46:29,807
This tricolour will fly
in the sky for ever.

2390
02:46:29,876 --> 02:46:32,401
lt will sway for a lifetime.

2391
02:46:32,479 --> 02:46:37,815
lf you teach them, they
cannot forget it.

2392
02:46:37,884 --> 02:46:43,288
They can have themselves
beheaded, but won't bow their heads.

2393
02:46:43,356 --> 02:46:48,817
They can have themselves
beheaded, but won't bow their heads.

2394
02:46:52,232 --> 02:46:54,291
Hail the motherland.

2395
02:46:54,834 --> 02:46:56,768
Hail the motherland.

2396
02:46:57,370 --> 02:46:59,838
Hail the motherland.
