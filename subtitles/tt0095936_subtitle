But Madhu they are not going to
Iisten to me at aII

72
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:23,155
Even after knowing, that I am
carrying your baby

73
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:27,060
I agree that I have put you
in a great fix

74
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,334
But there was no other way
except this

75
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:30,627
There is onIy one way

76
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:34,430
I consume poison & die so that
you can get married peacefuIIy

77
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:37,141
No, madhu, no, I have thought
of a way out

78
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:37,909
What?

79
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:40,906
I have heard that your sister
& uncIe have come from DeIhi

80
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:43,081
Yes -You to go DeIhi
with them

81
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,849
I have a good friend
there -

82
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:46,847
He wiII take you to
a good doctor

83
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,944
you don't have to
worry at aII

84
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:51,019
Go in the morning and return
in the evening

85
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,952
He wiII do the
abortion

86
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:57,455
And here is some money
for your expenses

87
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:04,335
I know you are a
coward -

88
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:08,336
But you are so mean, I have come
to know onIy today

89
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:26,520
Keep quiet, keep quiet,
Don't cry

90
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:33,799
Don't do anything
rash-

91
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:35,796
So that situation doesn't
worsen further

92
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:38,297
Brother,What's Ieft
there to worsen

93
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:40,633
After destroying the Iife of
our Madhu

94
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,937
That rascaI is going to
get married

95
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:45,143
I wiII stop this
marriage

96
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:52,478
Listen, I wiII go and meet
Ratan's father,Thakur Raghuvir Singh

97
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:57,587
I am very sure that when he comes
to know the facts-

98
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:00,816
He wiII force Ratan
to fuIfiI his promise

99
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:02,189
Answer Ratan

100
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:05,155
The accusation that Thakur
Jaswant Singh has put on you

101
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,033
Is it true? Or
is it a Iie?

102
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:10,026
Father, aII are Iies

103
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:17,471
Look, Ratan

104
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:22,738
I have come here neither to
quarreI nor to scoId you

105
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:27,411
Human beings make mistakes,
You have aIso committed etc

106
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:31,385
But now it is your duty that you
accept your mistake

107
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:33,751
And keep the promise you
made to Madhumathi...

108
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:35,460
What's the mistake &
What's the promise?

109
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:40,930
By concocting these stories
you want to defame me

110
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:42,861
Concocting stories!?

111
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,963
Then, is it not true that Madhumathi
is pregnant?

112
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:47,428
She might be

113
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:50,198
She might be but I am not
responsibIe for it

114
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:51,704
You are a Iiar, you are
a crook.

115
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:54,304
And you are mean & wretched
person of the highest order

116
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:54,979
Dhanraj

117
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:56,272
Thakur Jaswant Singh

118
00:06:56,816 --> 00:07:00,183
Ask Dhanraj to shut up otherwise
there wiII be bIoodshed here

119
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:02,617
There wiII be bIoodshed
Randhir Singh

120
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:05,289
My sister's honour is ruined
& I remain a siIent spectator -

121
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,550
I wiII exterminate whoIe
of your cIan

122
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:10,763
Dhanraj keep quiet
Let me taIk

123
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:12,658
Then you taIk

124
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,259
There is no use striking your
head against a stone

125
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:27,303
Mr.Randhir Singh

126
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,777
Knowing weII, its a question of the
prestige of our famiIy -

127
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:36,646
I Ieave the decision
to you

128
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:41,992
Thakur Jaswant Singh, I fuIIy
sympathise with you-

129
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,458
More than that I cannot
say anything

130
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:53,661
Remember Thakur

131
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:58,473
The end resuIt of this wiII
not be good

132
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:23,327
ShaII I say something?

133
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:24,226
Go ahead

134
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,269
Whatever Thakur Jaswant Singh
had said

135
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:30,738
It's aII true

136
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:31,602
What is true?

137
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,770
This evening Madhumathi had come to
meet Ratan here-

138
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:39,542
Hiding behind the window I
heard their entire conversation-

139
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:44,047
They used to meet steaIthy,
and she-

140
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,884
Is going to be the mother of
Ratan's chiId

141
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:51,554
PIease Iisten to me. For god's
sake stop this marriage

142
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:55,265
And make Ratan to agree to
marry Madhumathi

143
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,060
Keep quiet,absoIuteIy
keep quiet-

144
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:01,636
Before marriage the girI who has
Iost her honour

145
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:04,542
She is not worthy of becoming the
daughter-in-Iaw of this famiIy

146
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:07,708
And Iisten very
carefuIIy-

147
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:10,141
You have mentioned
this today-

148
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:14,746
But here after if anybody taIks
even a word about it-

149
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:16,284
I wiII be very harsh
on him

150
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:26,064
Randhir, Son you make your
father see to reason

151
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,843
Dhanraj, Nothing wiII go
out of confrontation

152
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:42,075
There wiII be a
big scandaI

153
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,940
We'II Ioose our prestige in the
entire viIIage-

154
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:48,779
Then by keeping quiet wiII this
thing Iie dormant-

155
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:52,948
From tomorrow itseIf this news
wiII spread Iike wiId fire

156
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:56,153
That we wiII be constrained even
to step out of this house

157
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:01,193
That's why I have decided to
Ieave this viIIage

158
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:08,135
We wiII seII our house, SeII
the entire property -

159
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:09,068
And go to DeIhi

160
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:11,338
And what shaII we
do there?

161
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:15,044
Whatever we do,
We may even starve

162
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:17,275
But we won't be ridicuIed
by peopIe

163
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:23,184
A respectabIe person can bear aII
the hardships of the worId-

164
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:25,855
But cannot Iive
shameIessIy

165
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,874
Dhanraj whatever I am
going to do-

166
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:50,109
I am very sad about it

167
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,473
I am sure

168
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:56,352
That kishan wiII give us a good
price for our house & fieIds

169
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,020
Okay, I'II return
by the evening

170
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:09,695
Brother

171
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:13,533
Parvati, What happened?

172
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:38,255
Ratan Singh

173
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:59,310
Ratan singh this is the corpse of my
sister Madhumathi

174
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:01,810
According to your promises -

175
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,419
She shouId have become your
bride today-

176
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,820
But today her dead body wiII
be carried-

177
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:15,323
Dead body wiII be carried
Ratan Singh,but not one

178
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:17,727
Stop -

179
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:18,560
But two

180
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:20,429
Wait Dhanraj

181
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:53,659
Court awarded Iife imprisonment
to Thakur Dhanraj Singh for murder

182
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:56,064
Surrounded by the high waIIs
of the jaiI

183
00:13:56,335 --> 00:14:01,204
A narrow ceII became the abode
of Dhanraj Singh

184
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:05,976
Jaswant Singh soId his house &
the entire property-

185
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:10,239
Left the viIIage Dhanakpur for good
& went away to DeIhi

186
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,313
And in the house
of Bhagwandas-

187
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:17,579
He started a new Iife with
his entire famiIy-

188
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,553
In partnership with Bhagwandas
he started cIoth business-

189
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:26,331
And became a very successfuI trader
in no time

190
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:28,724
He had onIy one aim
in his Iife-

191
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,699
To give good education to
the son of Dhanraj

192
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:34,064
And Iike this the
time passed

193
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,808
Days became months & months
became years

194
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:38,202
And then that day came

195
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:52,822
For your good conducts, Govt. has
decided to reIease you 6 months earIy

196
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:59,463
My dear father, You wiII be
pIeased to know

197
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:01,325
That now our exams
are over

198
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,735
On 10th ApriI, in our coIIege
there is a fareweII party

199
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,973
In this party, aIong with my
friends I am -

200
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,732
Presenting a musicaI
programme

201
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:14,438
UncIe amd others in the famiIy
are not interested in music

202
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:16,003
Had you been here

203
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,772
I wouId have definiteIy
invited

204
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:21,285
But its my bad Iuck that you
are so far away

205
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:24,618
But that day is not far
when you'II be amongst us-

206
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:27,615
And I am impatientIy waiting
for that day

207
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:29,790
Your son, Raj

208
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:37,619
Friends, first I want to thank
the 2nd year students

209
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:40,254
Who, for the finaI
year students,

210
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,524
Have given this grand
party today

211
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:50,538
For us this is our Iast day
in the coIIege

212
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:52,008
And I know

213
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:55,479
That for the forthcoming Iife
everyone has thought of something

214
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:59,212
But I haven't thought of
anything for me

215
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:01,851
And today

216
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:05,348
Today I am thinking of onIy one
thing repeatedIy

217
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:06,782
What?

218
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:41,688
Today the programme was
very enjoyabIe

219
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:44,528
What's the programme
in the hoIidays

220
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,532
We are stuck up badIy
- Why

221
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,067
UncIe has put us
in the office

222
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,205
Very unfortunate

223
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:50,339
Why don't you come for hunting
with us

224
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:51,405
What Shyam?
ShaII we go?

225
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:52,234

00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:04,339
Dhanraj brother
When you were in jaiI...-

00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:08,747
Bhagwandas!
I have a request-

243
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:13,085
JaiI and whatever this famiIy
has gone through-

244
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:15,816
ShouId never be mentioned

245
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,862
Brother teII me

246
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,931
How is our business

247
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:27,164
By the grace of god,
its very good

248
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:29,201
Now you have come

249
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:32,474
Raj and Shyam

250
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,405
We wiII improve it

251
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,313
It's definiteIy the mischief
of that rascaI Randhir Singh

I'II go to Dhanakpur

253
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:23,851
Brother, neither you nor brother
Jaswant need go to Dhanakpur

254
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:26,061
Raj & Shyam can go and
do this job

255
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:28,298
And aIso nobody recognizes
them there

256
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:29,591
Yes that shouId be aIright

257
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:31,895

260
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,575

There meet Iawyer BihariIaI and

262
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:43,506
Okay

263
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:44,214

Don't roam there
unnecessariIy

266

But teII Thakur

00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:03,967
That the case won't
be decided soon

271
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:05,702
Won't be decided soon?
- No

272
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,931
AppIication is against
Randhir Singh

273
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:09,537
He wiII aIso act soon

274
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:12,341
What wiII he do soon?

275
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:14,571
It's difficuIt to teII
you immediateIy

276
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:18,913
Listen. LegaI matters are not
resoIved immediateIy

277
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,879
As the proceeding proceeds,-

278
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:24,384
I wiII inform Mr.Jaswant Singh
immediateIy about them

279
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,619
ImmediateIy - definiteIy

280
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,222
Listen, Randhir Singh is a very
dangerous person

281
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:34,755
The news of your arrivaI can
reach him immediateIy - yes

282
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,729
That's why it
wiII be better-

283
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:38,763
That both of you go away
immediateIy

284
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:42,001
Okay, We'II go away
immediateIy

285
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:45,274
I want to go to a pIace...
immediateIy

286
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:53,582
What a strange man? Come Iet's
go from here

287
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:55,080
ShaII we go?

288
00:25:57,422 --> 00:26:00,482
In my youth I was sitting
on a horse-

289
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,556
And the horse is running

290
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:08,793
Horse feII down. I am down and
the horse is above me

291
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:10,058
What happened? Why did you
stop the bike

292
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:13,600
This is probabIy the mansion of
Thakur Raghuvir Singh isn't it ?

293
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:15,697
May be

294
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:19,337
Come Iet's ask that person
come

295
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:21,941
And then...

296
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,011
UncIe greetings

297
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:24,840
Greetings

298
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,516
Whose mansion is this?

299
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:32,515
This is Thakur Raghuvir Singh's
mansion in the name of god

300
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,452
But he is no more aIive

301
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,788
His son's are there.
Thakur Randhir Singh

302
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:41,155
Brother, the entire famiIy has
shifted to DeIhi

303
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:44,425
He comes once in a year to settIe
the accounts of farming-

304
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:48,298
In the name of god

305
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:03,285
She is Rashmi, daughter of
Thakur Randhir Singh

306
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:07,784
The great activity that you are
seeing in the mansion today-

307
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:10,017
Is because its her
birthday today

308

00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,510
One shouId not read the paIm

311
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,183
But one thing is
certain

312
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,253
Very soon, someone is going
to enter your Iife

313
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,889
ProbabIy tonight

314
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:48,759
From Haripur, Ietter has come that
Kunwar Pratap Singh wiII not be coming -

315
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:50,766

00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,669
Even I had seen him
when he was this much

319
00:27:57,942 --> 00:27:59,068
Now, he must be
a young man

320
00:27:59,344 --> 00:27:59,935
Brother!

321
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:03,880
We cannot have a better match
for Rashmi than this

322
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:06,015

00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:31,734
Why?

348
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:36,230
We Thakurs, have a arrow
sharp vision-

349
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:40,077
That can recognize the friends
and aIso the foes

350
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:42,677
Isn't it? - What?

351
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:46,683
Confused isn't it?
- Yes

352
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:50,676
I had seen you when you
were this big

353
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:53,617
But, I recognized you
as soon as I saw you -

354
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:58,620
That you are definiteIy Roop Singh
son of Kunwar Pratap Singh

355
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:00,360
Ask me...how?

356
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:01,289
How?

357
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:04,297
After seeing the 'R' symboI
on your coat

358
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:06,698
'R' means Roop Singh!

359
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:10,600
Come with me

360
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:12,271
No, you proceed...I...

361
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,474
Come with me...Come on...

362
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:18,815
Brother! Here is your
Roop Singh

363
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:20,475
He was standing in
that corner

364
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:23,813
Recognized me?

365
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:25,884
Yes, greetings!

366
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:30,016
OnIy greetings wiII not do
you have to hug me

367
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:36,563
Mr.Man Singh, Come here

368
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:39,103
He is Roop Singh, Son of
Kunwar Pratap Singh

369
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:39,969
Greetings!

370
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:44,873
Is he Roop Singh?!

371
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,809
Yes, he is Roop Singh

372
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:52,012
I don't know whether
to beIieve my eyes or not?

373
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,481
But I feeI something strange
about your appearance

374
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:55,815
Appearance

375
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:56,950
Yes

376
00:30:57,956 --> 00:31:02,359
Last year, When I met you in Haripur
You had a great moustache

377
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:03,960
Moustache?!

378
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:05,424
Yes, Where has it gone?

379
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,097
That, I have shaved it

380
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:07,961
Why?

381
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:08,890
Just Iike that!

382
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,364
No, No,... Why?

383
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:12,067
Just Iike that ..

384
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:13,960
Why?...Why?

385
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:15,229
Mr.Mansingh!

386
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:18,668
It's empty!

387
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:24,538
Your father couIdn't come
I regret very much

388
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:25,078
Yes!

389
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:25,874
What happened to him?

390
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:28,408
He...actuaIIy...that...

391
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,417
Again the same Asthma attack?

392
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:31,748
Yes sir, Asthma!

393
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,422
Yes, my son, Asthma is a very
dangerous disease

394
00:31:37,695 --> 00:31:39,560
Then, ShaII I Ieave?

395
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:40,753

396
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,792
How wiII I aIIow you to go
without attending the feast -

397
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:45,566
And today, its my
daughter's birthday

398
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:46,898
Don't you want to
meet her?

399
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:48,137
Don't you want to
greet her?

400
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:50,873
You wait here, I'II come with

00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,473
WonderfuI...WonderfuI, How gracefuI

402
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:58,344
Roop Singh! TeII me one thing
Why did you shave off your moustache?

403
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:00,080
Just Iike that!?!...Why?

404
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:02,943
But, Why?...Why?

405
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:05,485
Oh! I have shaved my moustache
How does it concern you?

406
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:06,086
Leave my hand

407
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:10,026
Okay, granted it was your moustache
but why did you shave it off?

408
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:11,684
Hey, GentIeman, How many times

00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:12,487

410
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:15,294
Are you reaIIy Roop Singh?

411
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:15,966
Yes sir

412
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:18,467
Son of Kunwar Pratap Singh?

413
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:19,668
Yes...Yes

414
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:28,274
Come I'II introduce you to
one more Roop Singh

415
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:40,479
ChiId, You wait here, I'II
come just now

416
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:44,752
DharampaI! What's
happening here?

417
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:47,094
He feII, I feII on him -

418
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:48,961
Then aII the Thakurs
feII on me

419
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:49,959
But, Who is he?

420
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:51,529
How many times, do I have
to teII you that I am Roop Singh

421
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:52,235
What are you bIabbering?

422
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:53,829
Catch them...Catch them..
atch them...

423
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:14,219
Rashmi, and then,
What happened

424
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:18,821
Then, everyone feII
caIIing each other

425
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,425
There was a great
uproar

426
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:23,559
And that boy, who came
impersonating Roop Singh

427
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:25,568
I never saw him

428
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,435
In the meIee, he
ran away

429
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:31,498
Randhir Singh, my son!

430
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:33,005
Yes mother!

431
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:35,872
Did you find out anything about
that imposter?

432
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:37,943
Now onIy Mr.CIerk, informed
me that -

433
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:41,080
To fiIe an appIication against
us in the court -

434
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:43,583
Dhanraj's son had come

435
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:47,891
And that too, on a red
motor cycIe

436
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:53,620
If onIy, I knew it before
he ran away

437
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,835
In front of aII my cIan I wouId
have Iashed him so much that -

438
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,635
OnIy his corpse wouId have
gone out from here

439
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:03,372
WonderfuI!...WonderfuI!

440
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:04,734
Come on, Iisten...
Listen...Listen

441
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:08,042
Received a Ietter from Pandit
Shivnarain of Mt.Abu-

442
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:12,011
He has invited aII of us to
his son's bethrothaI

443
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:14,847
I think, We didn't have a
hoIiday for quite a Iong time

444
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:16,678
So why not take advantage of this
and go to Mt.Abu

445
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:19,412
Brother, there is a Amba TempIe
near by -

446
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:23,759
I had taken a vow that if he comes back
I wiII offer fIowers

447
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:25,155
Yes, Yes definiteIy
go there

448
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:26,823
AIright, teII me this, Are you coming
to Sitanagar Camp?

449
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,894
It wiII be difficuIt for
me to come

450
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:34,202
Father is sending me to Mt.Abu
with mother and Aunty

451
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,003
Mt.Abu and Sitanagar
are very near

452
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:38,841
It's just 3 hours journey
by bus

453
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,470
You just teII your father that you want to
go to Sitanagar and not Mt.Abu

454
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:45,146
But, I can't open my mouth
infront of my father

455
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:46,815
Then, take me with you
to him

456
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:49,213
I wiII open my mouth weII
in front of him

457
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:51,413
UncIe! I was saying that

458
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:54,289
Mt.Abu is Mt.Abu and
Sitanagar is Sitanagar

459
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:55,421
Have you ever visited it?

460
00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:57,761
No

461
00:34:58,563 --> 00:34:59,086
UncIe, you shouId visit -

462
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:03,292
If Mt.Abu is earth, then
Sitanagar is the sky!

463
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:05,695
Kavitha, how coId the weather
wiII be?

464
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:08,804
There's so much coId that
You'II aIways be...

465
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:11,539
Oh god! Then, we wiII
stay in Mt.Abu onIy

466
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:13,208
Even then, I am very scared
of coId

467
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:14,673
Hey, are we going there
to enjoy or...

468
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:16,676
Come on Aunty! It is not
Iike that ...actuaIIy

469
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:19,877
One minute, One minute
I wiII decide now

470
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:20,880
Rashmi!

471
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:26,151
Where do you want to go? Sitanagar? Or Mt.Abu?

472
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:30,086
Come on, say it?

473
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:31,691
Mt.Abu!

474
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:33,222
It's decided

475
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:35,421
KamaIa, I am going to
the office

476
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:40,668
I had toId you, That I'II stagger
infront of my father

477
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:44,135
Don't worry, Come to Mt.Abu

480
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:28,750
Then, What time has the priest
fixed for the engagement?

481
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:32,518
Evening 6'o cIock! Yes sir, wiII reach

You stay here, I'II come

485

BadIy stuck!

486
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:01,268
Is it broke?

487
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:03,180
No

488
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:10,153
I have taken your photograph
aIong with sun

489
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:11,816
You are not offended,

490
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:16,258
No, if the photos wiII be good then,
I wiII not be offended at aII

491
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:19,760
I don't know much about
photography?

492
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:21,763
Just trying the Iuck

493
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:22,689
Yes

494
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:26,464
For every new thing, its absoIuteIy
necessary to try the Iuck

495

Yes

496

00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:41,084
Its a very good pIace to

619
00:47:48,632 --> 00:47:55,094
Oh! Mr.Raj,if you are uncomfortabIe

620
00:47:57,741 --> 00:47:59,675
Raj you are very
secretive

621
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:06,740
Where are you going

622
00:48:08,151 --> 00:48:10,346

But, She is Randhir Singh's

629
00:48:29,673 --> 00:48:29,934
Think over it

630
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:01,800
Come on friends

631
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:04,336

646
00:51:47,404 --> 00:51:51,204

647
00:51:54,077 --> 00:51:55,203

Don't know, how I am
Iooking?

658
00:55:36,232 --> 00:55:37,358
But, how did aII
this happen?

659
00:55:38,802 --> 00:55:41,771
I was going to Sitanagar and
my bus broke down

660
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:45,630
I was taking photographs
of the jungIe

661
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:49,608
I never knew from where this boy
and his friends came

662
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,414
They started misbehaving
with me

663
00:55:53,483 --> 00:55:56,281
I aIso gave him such a kick
that he'II never forget

664
00:55:57,821 --> 00:55:58,549
Any other hurts?

665
00:56:00,423 --> 00:56:03,187
No,nothing that need
dettoI

666
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:10,356
There are some sandwiches in this
Have some

667
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:37,956
What are you doing?

668
00:56:38,428 --> 00:56:39,292
Don't you want to sIeep?

669
00:56:40,697 --> 00:56:42,494
No, No, I'II not
sIeep here

670
00:56:43,833 --> 00:56:47,735
Look, take me to the road there
I am sure of getting a bus

671
00:56:48,138 --> 00:56:49,469
I have forgotten the way
to the road myseIf

672
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:53,604
I had come on a hunting trip
with friends

673
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:57,142
They went on hunting and I got
separated from them

674
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:58,611
Are you teIIing the
truth?

675
00:57:00,216 --> 00:57:03,151
Then, What in this dangerous forest am I
spending this night for fun?

676
00:57:10,693 --> 00:57:11,751
Are you going to
sIeep?

677
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:14,854
Won't you have a smaII
chat?

678
00:57:15,632 --> 00:57:17,293
Didn't get tired after wandering
in the forest the whoIe day?

679
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:22,002
I was tired, but after meeting you
I have become fresh

680
00:57:22,405 --> 00:57:24,771

00:57:39,722 --> 00:57:42,020
That if I get scared,
I cannot hoId your hand

685
00:57:45,094 --> 00:57:46,152
Scared? Being a Rajput

686
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:48,761
How do you know that I am
a Rajput?

687
00:57:49,766 --> 00:57:50,824
Your modesty and spIendour
are Iike Rajput?

00:57:51,534 --> 00:57:51,829
Thank you

689
00:57:52,602 --> 00:57:54,900

Can I come to you?

692
00:59:54,891 --> 00:59:57,155
May be, You want to know
something about me

693
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:58,356
What?

694
00:59:58,828 --> 01:00:00,090
Why don't you ask me
straight away?

695
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:01,161
Ask what?

696
01:00:01,631 --> 01:00:04,156
Okay, don't ask, I wiII teII
myseIf

697
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:07,627
That, I am from DeIhi,
Where do you come from?

698
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:14,470
I am a Rajput and my
name is Rashmi

699
01:00:15,078 --> 01:00:15,669
What is your name?

700
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:16,477
Raj!

701
01:00:18,414 --> 01:00:24,353
I think its better to teII you that I
have passed my first year exams

702
01:00:25,421 --> 01:00:29,152
I am 18 years oId and I have
not married yet

703
01:00:30,827 --> 01:00:33,819
Look, there is nothing
to hide

704
01:00:38,868 --> 01:00:43,271
Now, that fate has put us together
in this way -

705
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:46,474
We don't know for how Iong we
wiII be wandering Iike this -

706
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:50,208
It'II be better if we know something
about each other

707
01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:54,939
It wiII be better,
isn't it?

708
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:59,883
Then, I have toId you
everything cIearIy

709
01:01:02,291 --> 01:01:04,486
You have impressed
me a Iot

710
01:01:05,294 --> 01:01:08,286
I think this reIationship
shouId deveIop -

711
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:12,833
If you ask me my address
I wiII not refuse

712
01:01:13,302 --> 01:01:14,360
Look, We'II have this taIk
Iater on

713
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:16,032
First Iet me find the
way to the road

714
01:01:16,406 --> 01:01:17,031
Then, Why don't you
move on? -

715
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:21,401
Why are you wasting the time
standing here and taIking nonsense?

716
01:01:21,611 --> 01:01:22,737
Was I taIking nonsense?

717
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:24,070
Then, was I taIking
nonsense?

718
01:01:28,418 --> 01:01:29,612
Look, its not a
matter to Iaugh

719
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:32,354
If we don't find the way by
this evening, then -

720
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:36,288
For the entire Iife, we wiII be
going round this pIace

721
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,418
Can this happen?

722
01:01:40,963 --> 01:01:41,895
No

723
01:06:17,406 --> 01:06:20,842
The road is so near and in the night
it seemed so far away, isn't it?

724
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:28,075
The road, which we were madIy trying
in finding out tiII yesterday

725
01:06:28,751 --> 01:06:30,742
Today, I feeI Iike crying
after seeing it

726
01:06:31,754 --> 01:06:34,086
You'II go some where
I'II go some where

727
01:06:36,292 --> 01:06:37,884
WiII you meet me
in DeIhi?

728
01:06:39,028 --> 01:06:41,758
Even if you don't want to meet, atIeast
say yes,to make me happy

729
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:44,561
AtIeast I wiII wait
for you

730
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:47,033
Rashmi, Why are you taIking
Iike this?

731
01:06:50,473 --> 01:06:55,740
When I came to Mt.Abu, I never thought
I was going to meet someone suddenIy -

732
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:58,078
Who'II take my feet off
the ground

733
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:02,081
But, this has happened

734
01:07:03,085 --> 01:07:05,815
Ever since I have met you, I don't know
what has happened to me?

735
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:13,423
TeIIing you aII this, doesn't mean that
I am asking something in return -

736
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:18,288
If I had gone mad after someone
it is not necessary that-

737
01:07:18,901 --> 01:07:20,368
That someone eIse shouId aIso be
mad after me

738
01:08:11,687 --> 01:08:12,210
Look, the girI is
the same one

739
01:08:13,222 --> 01:08:14,314
But who is with her?

740
01:08:29,004 --> 01:08:31,199
Raj, they are the
same rogues

741
01:08:31,807 --> 01:08:34,332
Look there, the camera in his
hand is mine

742
01:08:35,144 --> 01:08:35,667
Raj Iets go

743
01:08:48,057 --> 01:08:49,581
What? Where did you spend
the whoIe night?

744
01:08:49,892 --> 01:08:51,291
With this cock

745
01:08:58,667 --> 01:08:59,656
We were staying together
in the hoteI

746
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:03,469
We share everything in eating
drinking and aII other things

747
01:09:04,006 --> 01:09:05,098
Etc...Etc...Etc...

748
01:09:08,277 --> 01:09:09,403
PIease return back
the camera

749
01:09:09,678 --> 01:09:11,407
No, Raj I don't want
the camera

750
01:09:12,281 --> 01:09:13,805
She doesn't want
the camera

751
01:09:15,017 --> 01:09:15,381
What do you want?

752
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:20,980
Come on babe, say it into
the ears of baba

753
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:24,422
Come on, I'II never reveaI it
to anyone

754
01:09:25,227 --> 01:09:26,091
I swear by him

755
01:09:26,896 --> 01:09:29,387
Look, Mister there is a Iimit
for everything -

756
01:09:30,432 --> 01:09:32,423
Its better for you, not to
cross the Iimit

757
01:09:33,202 --> 01:09:36,638
Otherwise, What wiII
you do?

758
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:40,607
What wiII you do?

759
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:43,376
Me! What can I do...

760
01:09:44,146 --> 01:09:47,013
At the most I can kick
you between the Iegs.

761
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:43,227
Stop!

762
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:00,748
Look there, Raj!

763
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:27,366
Look, didn't I teII you that
I'II come

764
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:29,599
That too in styIe!

765
01:12:29,878 --> 01:12:30,867
Oh Yes!

766
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:45,960
Do you know that yesterday,
he saved my Iife

767
01:12:46,628 --> 01:12:50,758
Yesterday my bus had a fIat tyre and
4-6 rowdies surrounded me...

768
01:12:50,966 --> 01:12:52,160
Enough...Enough..
enough..

769
01:12:53,001 --> 01:12:55,231
It seems to be Iong winding taIe
it may need a Iot of time to hear

770
01:12:55,871 --> 01:12:56,929
Anyway are these peopIe going
to stay here onIy?

771
01:12:57,539 --> 01:12:59,973
No, No, We are in the hoteI
on The Rock...

772
01:13:00,142 --> 01:13:01,473
Take out their Iuggage!

773
01:13:23,999 --> 01:13:28,299
Raj, two days have passed aIready
are we going back to HoteI or not?

774
01:13:28,771 --> 01:13:29,601
We'II go friend, tomorrow
we'II go

775
01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:33,537
Does Rashmi know
who you are?

776
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:38,539
No

777
01:13:39,615 --> 01:13:41,139
Keeping someone, ignorant of the facts
is not good

778
01:14:23,492 --> 01:14:24,356
I want to teII
you something

779
01:14:26,361 --> 01:14:29,489
EarIier aIso I wanted to say
but couIdn't say -

780
01:14:32,668 --> 01:14:33,692
But now, I have to
say it

781
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:39,336
Do you know, Who am I?

782
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:53,819
AtIeast get up, now!
It's 10 '0' cIock

783
01:14:55,424 --> 01:14:56,083
Where is Rashmi?

784
01:14:56,592 --> 01:14:58,219
She has gone to hoteI on the Rock
with Shyam

785
01:14:58,861 --> 01:14:59,088
Why?

786
01:14:59,695 --> 01:15:01,094
She wanted to teIephone her
mother at Mt.Abu

787
01:15:02,097 --> 01:15:03,029
Connect a caII to DeIhi

788
01:15:03,298 --> 01:15:04,424
The number is...

789
01:15:08,937 --> 01:15:09,869
But madam, it wiII take a
IittIe time

790
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:12,773
Don't bother, We'II wait
come Shyam

791
01:15:15,944 --> 01:15:17,809
Rashmi, I'II come,
just now

792
01:15:24,953 --> 01:15:25,885
We have a reservation here!

793
01:15:27,664 --> 01:15:29,131
Is Mr.Raj,staying here?

794
01:15:38,742 --> 01:15:44,044
Hubby, Iisten to me, isn't she the same girI
We had seen in Mt.Abu

795
01:15:45,715 --> 01:15:46,306
Oh yes!

796
01:15:52,322 --> 01:15:53,254
Okay, you are forgiven!

797
01:15:53,723 --> 01:15:55,452
But I wiII certainIy
ask your name

798
01:15:56,926 --> 01:15:57,585
Very beautifuI name!

799
01:15:58,261 --> 01:15:59,455
She is my wife,Saroj

800
01:15:59,863 --> 01:16:00,192
Greetings

801
01:16:01,531 --> 01:16:03,999
Do you know, we had seen you
in Mt.Abu's hoteI

802
01:16:04,401 --> 01:16:05,265
I had aIso seen you

803
01:16:06,069 --> 01:16:06,933
You are Raj's parents

804
01:16:07,737 --> 01:16:08,260
Yes, Yes

805
01:16:08,905 --> 01:16:10,270
Do you know Raj?

806
01:16:10,907 --> 01:16:15,037
Yes...I know Raj? No...

807
01:16:15,845 --> 01:16:19,440
Then, how did you know that
We are his parents

808
01:16:23,052 --> 01:16:26,783
That... Oh Shyam, Why don't
you come here?

809
01:16:29,325 --> 01:16:30,917
Hey, Shyam, What are you
doing there? Come here

810
01:16:34,397 --> 01:16:34,863
UncIe greetings!

811
01:16:35,865 --> 01:16:36,194
Greetings

812
01:16:36,666 --> 01:16:38,065
Shyam, Why are you Iooking
so scared?

813
01:16:38,468 --> 01:16:39,457
Scared? No...I am not...

814
01:16:41,237 --> 01:16:43,398
Rashmi, are you staying
in this hoteI?

815
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:44,529
No sir

816
01:16:45,241 --> 01:16:48,108
We have come here on a camp with
Iots of girIs and boys

817
01:16:49,379 --> 01:16:52,371
Perhaps, then Raj and Shyam are
aIso staying there

818
01:16:54,651 --> 01:16:55,049
Yes sir

819
01:16:55,385 --> 01:16:57,250
Shyam, go and caII Raj!

820
01:16:57,720 --> 01:16:58,379
CaII Raj?!

821
01:16:58,655 --> 01:17:00,384
Yes, Yes...Raj! Do you have a
car with you?

822
01:17:01,124 --> 01:17:02,250
Yes.. I have with me
Hamid Khan's jeep

823
01:17:02,459 --> 01:17:03,323
go and
get him

824
01:17:06,796 --> 01:17:09,924
And we'II go to the coffee shop
for a chat.come on Rashmi

825
01:17:18,508 --> 01:17:18,997
What happened?

826
01:17:19,909 --> 01:17:21,774
Father has come to the hoteI, bIunders
are being committed there

827
01:17:23,179 --> 01:17:24,578
Rashmi is with them,
taIking to them,you come

828
01:17:27,183 --> 01:17:28,514
On the way my bus
broke down

829
01:17:29,252 --> 01:17:31,516
I was taking few photographs
in the nearby forest

830
01:17:32,322 --> 01:17:34,790
SuddenIy, I don't know from where
4 boys had come there-

831
01:17:36,526 --> 01:17:38,016
And started misbehaving
with me

832
01:17:38,461 --> 01:17:43,592
Raj, if uncIe comes to know about Rashmi,
then we wiII be scoIded severeIy

833
01:17:44,667 --> 01:17:45,326
We may get thrashing
aIso!

834
01:17:46,069 --> 01:17:46,592
No

835
01:17:47,971 --> 01:17:48,596
Rashmi, wiII not say
anything!

836
01:17:49,639 --> 01:17:52,802
It was suprising that the
pIace where I was Iost

837
01:17:53,443 --> 01:17:54,239
Raj was aIso there!

838
01:17:55,645 --> 01:17:57,374
Otherwise, I aIone in that forest
I wouId have died

839
01:18:00,783 --> 01:18:02,910
And then Hamidkhan and Shahid Khan
came there

840
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:06,978
Then, aII the three hit them so much
that I couIdn't watch it

841
01:18:09,125 --> 01:18:10,717
It was good that atIeast
those peopIe Iearnt a Iesson

842
01:18:11,861 --> 01:18:13,055
Look, Raj has come!

843
01:18:14,664 --> 01:18:17,326
No phone, No news about your
whereabouts for the past 3 days -

844
01:18:17,667 --> 01:18:20,067
We were very worried about you.
That's why we are here

845
01:18:20,570 --> 01:18:24,438
You have heard the fuII story
Where did they have time to caII you?

846
01:18:25,241 --> 01:18:28,039
I heard that rogue hit
you with a bottIe

847
01:18:28,378 --> 01:18:29,174
Did you bIeed?

848
01:18:30,113 --> 01:18:31,910
Shedding bIood is a gIory
for the Rajputs

849
01:18:32,982 --> 01:18:33,243
Isn't it Rashmi?

850
01:18:33,650 --> 01:18:34,446
Yes absoIuteIy!

851
01:18:34,984 --> 01:18:36,451
My chiId, are you
a Rajput?

852
01:18:36,653 --> 01:18:37,381
Yes

853
01:18:38,054 --> 01:18:42,457
Hadn't I toId you that this girI
comes from a Rajput famiIy

854
01:18:43,326 --> 01:18:45,385
ChiId, What is your
father's name?

855
01:18:46,129 --> 01:18:48,063
Father, have you reserved
your room?

856
01:18:48,865 --> 01:18:51,129
Someone was saying that it is very
difficuIt to get a room in this hoteI

857
01:18:51,534 --> 01:18:52,466
We aIready have a room

858
01:18:54,771 --> 01:18:55,738
Enough ...Enough

859
01:18:56,973 --> 01:18:57,940
Your DeIhi caII has
come through

860
01:18:58,374 --> 01:18:59,636
Your father Mr.Randhir Singh
is on the Iine

861
01:19:06,449 --> 01:19:08,383
What was that name?
Randhir Singh?!

862
01:19:10,587 --> 01:19:11,315
I didn't hear
it properIy

863
01:19:14,924 --> 01:19:16,915
Do you know anything about
Rashmi's famiIy background?

864
01:19:20,530 --> 01:19:21,792
Raj, give me the
jeep keys!

865
01:19:22,599 --> 01:19:24,999
Saroj, take Raj and Shyam to their room,
I'II come just now

866
01:19:31,274 --> 01:19:33,401
Yes father, I'II go back in
2 or 4 days

867
01:19:34,978 --> 01:19:36,912
Yes, Okay...Yes Okay

868
01:19:41,718 --> 01:19:41,979
Finished taIking?

869
01:19:44,053 --> 01:19:47,386
Raj and Shyam have gone up with Saroj
come I'II drop you

870
01:19:50,460 --> 01:19:53,327
Why are you taking this troubIe?
I'II go by a taxi

871
01:19:53,596 --> 01:19:55,257
Why a taxi? When Hamid Khan's
jeep is here

872
01:19:55,865 --> 01:19:57,389
Come, Come, I'II
drop you

873
01:20:07,844 --> 01:20:10,108
So you are from DeIhi

874
01:20:10,780 --> 01:20:11,178
Yes

875
01:20:12,382 --> 01:20:14,009
What is your father's
name?

876
01:20:14,617 --> 01:20:15,879
Thakur Randhir Singh

877
01:20:18,788 --> 01:20:23,225
Your father has no reIation with
Dhanakpur viIIage,Isn't it

878
01:20:23,459 --> 01:20:26,053
Yes of course, actuaIIy we haiI from
that pIace onIy -

879
01:20:26,462 --> 01:20:29,056
StiII we have our mansion, and
certain Iands over there

880
01:21:20,516 --> 01:21:23,280
Rashmi, I want to ask
you something -

881
01:21:25,021 --> 01:21:26,784
Regarding you
and Raj

882
01:21:29,192 --> 01:21:30,784
The meeting of your's
and Raj's -

883
01:21:31,027 --> 01:21:33,461
Is onIy tiII knowing
each other or -

884
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:35,288
Has it gone beyond
it

885
01:21:37,700 --> 01:21:38,792
Rashmi, Give me
an answer

886
01:21:40,369 --> 01:21:42,337
I Iike Raj a Iot

887
01:21:42,572 --> 01:21:43,129
And Raj

888
01:21:43,406 --> 01:21:44,464
Even he

889
01:21:45,241 --> 01:21:48,176
Has Raj never asked you about
your famiIy members?

890
01:21:49,912 --> 01:21:50,344
No

891
01:21:50,580 --> 01:21:52,514
And even you didn't ask him,
Who he is?

892
01:21:52,915 --> 01:21:55,941
Rashmi, You have done a
big mistake

893
01:21:56,352 --> 01:21:58,616
Had you known, that who
Raj was? -

894
01:21:58,855 --> 01:22:00,447
Then, instead of Ioving -

895
01:22:00,690 --> 01:22:02,453
You wouId have
hated him

896
01:22:02,859 --> 01:22:03,791
This is not true -

897
01:22:04,026 --> 01:22:06,119
I can never have a hatred
for Raj

898
01:22:06,362 --> 01:22:08,296
Even after knowing -

899
01:22:08,531 --> 01:22:12,467
That he is the son of that same person
who kiIIed your uncIe Ratan Singh

900
01:22:12,702 --> 01:22:14,966
You...

901
01:22:15,238 --> 01:22:19,641
Yes... My name is onIy
Dhanraj Singh -

902
01:22:19,909 --> 01:22:22,173
And I onIy kiIIed
Ratan Singh

903
01:22:27,917 --> 01:22:35,688
Rashmi, Having any kind of reIation's with
your famiIy is next to impossibIe

904
01:22:36,092 --> 01:22:38,185
Even, if we are dying
out of water -

905
01:22:38,427 --> 01:22:42,022
StiII, having 2 drops of water from
your house is out of question

906
01:22:43,666 --> 01:22:46,100
And tiII Raj is
concerned -

907
01:22:46,302 --> 01:22:47,394
Then remember one
thing

908
01:22:47,804 --> 01:22:53,208
That Raj wiII not go against his famiIy,
for the sake of your Iove

909
01:22:53,509 --> 01:22:55,875
And if at aII this
happens -

910
01:22:56,012 --> 01:22:58,606
Then, I give you
an assurance -

911
01:22:58,881 --> 01:23:01,975
That I'II cut Raj into pieces with
these same hands

912
01:23:02,518 --> 01:23:05,954
But, I'II not Iet any reIations happen
with your famiIy

913
01:23:41,657 --> 01:23:44,592
Today, I bought this
for you -

914
01:23:45,494 --> 01:23:46,586
It was in the
hoteI's shop -

915
01:23:46,829 --> 01:23:48,592
I Iiked it

916
01:23:54,871 --> 01:23:56,736
I have a very strange
destiny -

917
01:23:56,973 --> 01:24:01,535
I onIy found you in the entire worId
for me to Iove

918
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:08,746
You must have feIt very bad after
Iearning that who I am

919
01:24:09,318 --> 01:24:12,412
Who you are, I knew it very
weII before

920
01:24:14,156 --> 01:24:17,421
I tried to fight a Iot
with myseIf -

921
01:24:19,495 --> 01:24:21,429
But what is destined,
definiteIy happens

922
01:24:22,498 --> 01:24:23,760
And further...

923
01:24:25,501 --> 01:24:27,594
Further, onIy that wiII happen,
What you want

924
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:33,474
But your father has given
me a threat -

925
01:24:33,709 --> 01:24:38,305
That if you go against the famiIy,
he'II kiII you to death

926
01:24:39,215 --> 01:24:44,152
If your father comes to know, probabIy
even he'II teII something Iike this

927
01:24:44,387 --> 01:24:47,481
WiII you stop Ioving me, after getting
scared to such threats?

928
01:24:47,723 --> 01:24:50,487
Raj, I wiII not be abIe to Iive
without you

929
01:24:53,729 --> 01:24:59,429
Rashmi, The authority of making a decision
regarding mine and your Iife -

930
01:24:59,669 --> 01:25:01,933
Is neither with your father,
nor with my father -

931
01:25:02,538 --> 01:25:04,096
We are definiteIy
their chiIdren -

932
01:25:04,373 --> 01:25:05,431
But not their
property

933
01:25:05,708 --> 01:25:07,642
But, they think Iike
that

934
01:25:09,211 --> 01:25:15,480
When I am abIe to afford for two squares of
meaIs and a sheIter of my own money

935
01:25:16,052 --> 01:25:17,815
Then, this reIation wiII
be broken

936
01:25:25,895 --> 01:25:29,490
Rashmi, Right now, I can't stay
for Iong -

937
01:25:29,732 --> 01:25:31,666
Tomorrow, I am going
to DeIhi -

938
01:25:32,068 --> 01:25:35,037
ProbabIy, we'II not be abIe to meet with
each other after reaching DeIhi -

939
01:25:35,938 --> 01:25:37,496
But, Remember this
much -

940
01:25:37,773 --> 01:25:39,536
That I'II aIways be
with you

941
01:25:41,410 --> 01:25:44,174
Whenever you see the
setting sun -

942
01:25:46,615 --> 01:25:47,877
Do you remember -

943
01:25:48,117 --> 01:25:50,210
This setting sun made us to meet for
the first time

944
01:25:51,287 --> 01:25:52,219
You watch -

945
01:25:52,455 --> 01:25:55,481
This setting sun wiII one day make
us meet forever

946
01:26:25,621 --> 01:26:27,714
Raj, UncIe is caIIing
you down

947
01:26:27,957 --> 01:26:28,548
Why?

948
01:26:28,791 --> 01:26:31,555
Don't know, but everybody is gathered
in the haII

949
01:26:32,461 --> 01:26:34,554
Come

950
01:26:34,797 --> 01:26:36,230
I'II come

951
01:26:46,842 --> 01:26:50,437
Dhanraj, taIk to him
a IittIe poIiteIy

952
01:26:56,619 --> 01:27:05,220
Whatever happened in Mount Abu. We aII
are definiteIy feeIing hurt about it

953
01:27:08,130 --> 01:27:13,727
I had never even thought, that my
own bIood, my own son

954
01:27:14,470 --> 01:27:18,065
With the daughter of this house's biggest
enemy Randhir Singh -

955
01:27:18,340 --> 01:27:21,275
WiII try to have any
sort of reIation -

956
01:27:22,344 --> 01:27:23,936
TeII me, How did aII this
happen?

957
01:27:29,185 --> 01:27:31,619
Did you know, that to which famiIy
did she beIong to?

958
01:27:33,856 --> 01:27:35,448
Raj, I am asking you
something?

959
01:27:36,025 --> 01:27:38,789
If this meeting was made
unknowingIy -

960
01:27:39,995 --> 01:27:41,360
Then I can forgive this mistake
of yours

961
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:46,564
But, I think you knew to
which famiIy did she...

962
01:27:46,869 --> 01:27:48,837
Dhanraj, What are
you taIking -

963
01:27:49,071 --> 01:27:50,629
Try to understand

964
01:27:50,906 --> 01:27:53,340
Had he knew, that she beIonged to which
mean and stained famiIy -

965
01:27:53,576 --> 01:27:54,008
So wouId he...

966
01:27:54,243 --> 01:27:54,675
Brother

967
01:27:54,910 --> 01:27:56,935
If Raj has somehow committed
this mistake -

968
01:27:57,179 --> 01:28:00,615
But stiII, I have fuII faith, that
he'II not repeat it again

969
01:28:00,850 --> 01:28:06,447
Saroj, I'd Iike to Iisten the
same from Raj

970
01:28:07,123 --> 01:28:13,289
Raj, I need your promise infront of
the entire famiIy -

971
01:28:13,696 --> 01:28:17,792
That, from now you'II have no reIation
with that girI

972
01:28:28,577 --> 01:28:32,343
AIright, if this your
answer -

973
01:28:33,749 --> 01:28:38,186
Then, it wouId be better if I teII everything
to Randhir Singh about this

974
01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:40,684
Father, PIease don't caII up
over there

975
01:28:40,923 --> 01:28:41,685
Why?

976
01:28:42,091 --> 01:28:44,184
What's the use of making it a
big wrangIe?

977
01:28:44,426 --> 01:28:46,018
I am not scared in making
it a wrangIe

978
01:28:49,598 --> 01:28:50,860
AIright

979
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:53,192
I'II never meet
Rashmi

980
01:28:54,770 --> 01:28:56,294
Are you promising

981
01:28:57,406 --> 01:28:58,839
Yes

982
01:29:00,910 --> 01:29:06,507
AIright, but don't think that the
matter has got over

983
01:29:06,916 --> 01:29:09,350
Don't give me even an eIement
of doubt

984
01:29:10,419 --> 01:29:11,681
Remember, this much -

985
01:29:11,921 --> 01:29:16,017
That from today, I'II keep a cIose
watch on you

986
01:29:19,061 --> 01:29:20,289
You can go

987
01:29:33,809 --> 01:29:35,071
Yes, everything
is fine

988
01:29:37,813 --> 01:29:38,745
And, you teII me

989
01:29:40,983 --> 01:29:42,416
It's Iike...

990
01:29:45,654 --> 01:29:48,589
I'II just check

991
01:29:51,493 --> 01:29:52,926
Yes we have received
the order

992
01:29:53,329 --> 01:29:54,091
Yes, Yes

993
01:30:28,731 --> 01:30:30,164
Rashmi, Are you fine?

994
01:30:30,566 --> 01:30:32,158
Raj, I am fine

995
01:30:32,401 --> 01:30:33,333
How are you?

996
01:30:33,569 --> 01:30:34,001
Yes...

997
01:30:34,403 --> 01:30:35,995
What happened after
Sitanagar?

998
01:30:36,272 --> 01:30:38,331
Did your father say anything
to you?

999
01:30:38,774 --> 01:30:41,834
My famiIy member's want me
to forget you -

1000
01:30:42,111 --> 01:30:46,013
And,as of now, they are under the
impression that I have forgotten you

1001
01:30:46,782 --> 01:30:48,716
Father, even gave me
a threat -

1002
01:30:48,951 --> 01:30:53,388
That if I don't agree, then he'II teII
everything to your father

1003
01:30:58,227 --> 01:31:00,491
Did your father have any
kind of doubt?

1004
01:31:00,729 --> 01:31:01,821
No

1005
01:31:05,901 --> 01:31:09,166
Do you know, that I came here to
buy something for you -

1006
01:31:09,438 --> 01:31:11,167
For your Birthday -

1007
01:31:13,275 --> 01:31:16,039
But I did not understand,
What to buy

1008
01:31:17,279 --> 01:31:20,214
Raj, I just need
one thing

1009
01:31:22,618 --> 01:31:23,710
Your togetherness -

1010
01:31:26,455 --> 01:31:29,049
And for this, I am prepared to wait
for my entire Iife -

1011
01:31:31,126 --> 01:31:32,218
Not for the entire Iife

1012
01:31:32,795 --> 01:31:36,390
OnIy tiII the 22nd of October

1013

01:31:46,842 --> 01:31:48,400
Have you taken what you
wanted to buy?

1017
01:31:48,844 --> 01:31:49,606
Yes

1018
01:31:49,845 --> 01:31:51,437
Come, Iet's go home

1019
01:37:15,937 --> 01:37:17,495
Keep it there

1020
01:37:17,773 --> 01:37:20,708
Read the Ietter by taking
God's name

1021
01:37:20,942 --> 01:37:24,036
Aunty, aII these neckIaces, jeweIs,
What's aII these?

1022
01:37:25,614 --> 01:37:26,706
Dharam, I have understood the
purpose of it -

1023
01:37:26,948 --> 01:37:28,381
And its a very good news
for us -

1024
01:37:28,617 --> 01:37:31,211
But atIeast read and Iet us know, as to
What has Pratap Singh written?

1025
01:37:33,288 --> 01:37:35,381
My dear friend Mr.
Randhir Singh -

1026
01:37:35,957 --> 01:37:40,053
The reIation of Iove and respect which is
between ours and your famiIy -

1027
01:37:40,295 --> 01:37:43,890
To strengthen it more, I have a
request to you -

1028
01:37:44,132 --> 01:37:49,900
That accept my son Roop Singh's marriage
with your Ioving daughter Rashmi

1029
01:37:52,174 --> 01:37:53,607

Rashmi, There's nothing to
worry about -

01:38:26,174 --> 01:38:27,232
We'II definiteIy find

Mother, aII the friends of mine

Don't Iisten to him

One minute, One minute

1045
01:38:34,850 --> 01:38:37,444
Mother, you decide on whom

Look, my son, according to me caII a few
cIose reIatives and some of your friends

1047
01:38:44,025 --> 01:38:45,694
That's it, It's not right to gather
a big crowd

1048
01:38:45,694 --> 01:38:46,456
That wiII be okay

1049
01:38:46,695 --> 01:38:48,629
Yes, I'II write down

1050
01:38:50,532 --> 01:38:51,464
Mother, you teII

That name of the aunty
from Ajmer

1052
01:39:05,847 --> 01:39:07,109
Why don't you peopIe make the
phone set right?

1053
01:39:07,349 --> 01:39:08,941
There's one ring, and
it gets cut

1054
01:39:09,184 --> 01:39:11,277
Rashmi, What's the matter, Why are you
so much prepIexed?

1055
01:39:13,188 --> 01:39:14,621
Raj, I am in a great
difficuIty -

1056
01:39:14,856 --> 01:39:16,448
There's a very big probIem
arosen

1057
01:39:16,691 --> 01:39:17,623
What probIem?

1058
01:39:18,026 --> 01:39:19,118
I can't teII it to you over
the phone -

1059
01:39:19,361 --> 01:39:20,623
That wiII be okay

1060
01:39:20,862 --> 01:39:21,624
I want to meet you

1061
01:39:21,863 --> 01:39:22,625
But where?

1062
01:39:22,864 --> 01:39:26,459
Near our coIIege Iibrary, I'II reach there
in another haIf an hour

1063
01:39:40,582 --> 01:39:44,348
I am going to the Iibrary, I have
to return the books

1064
01:39:45,921 --> 01:39:46,353
AIright

1065
01:40:27,996 --> 01:40:29,759
My famiIy members have fixed
my marriage

1066
01:40:29,998 --> 01:40:30,589
What?

1067
01:40:32,667 --> 01:40:34,100
The engagement is on the
next wednesday

1068
01:40:42,544 --> 01:40:43,602
Everything wiII get
aIright

1069
01:41:45,273 --> 01:41:49,175
I swear upon, that Rashmi has never met
this boy in Mount Abu -

1070
01:41:49,444 --> 01:41:50,706
I was aII the time
with her

1071
01:41:50,946 --> 01:41:51,878
If she has not
met -

1072
01:41:52,113 --> 01:41:53,705
Then how did these
photographs get cIicked?

1073
01:41:53,949 --> 01:41:55,473
If this is not Mount Abu, then
what eIse is it?

1074
01:41:55,717 --> 01:41:57,810
I am teIIing the truth,
I know nothing

1075
01:41:58,053 --> 01:41:59,145
But, Who is this
boy?

1076
01:41:59,387 --> 01:42:03,153
He is the same boy, Who on the night of
Rashmi's birthday in Dhanakpur viIIage -

1077
01:42:03,391 --> 01:42:05,154
Entered into our mansion by
becoming Roop Singh -

1078
01:42:05,393 --> 01:42:07,827
He is the son of
that Bastard

1079
01:42:08,563 --> 01:42:10,827
Is he Dhanraj's
son?

1080
01:42:11,066 --> 01:42:11,657
Yes

1081
01:42:12,567 --> 01:42:16,503
Brother, May be Rashmi doesn't know
who this boy is? -

1082
01:42:16,771 --> 01:42:20,537
When she comes to know, that this boy's
father had kiIIed our Ratan -

1083
01:42:20,942 --> 01:42:22,500
Then, she herseIf wiII start
hating him

1084
01:42:22,777 --> 01:42:25,211
That's right, Brother you
don't worry -

1085
01:42:25,447 --> 01:42:29,042
Today, as soon as Rashmi comes, We'II
teII her the truth

1086
01:42:29,284 --> 01:42:32,879
No, Nothing wouId be toId
to her -

1087
01:42:33,121 --> 01:42:35,885
Keep aII the photographs back
to its pIace -

1088
01:42:36,124 --> 01:42:39,059
She shouIdn't come to know, that we
know everything

1089
01:42:39,294 --> 01:42:43,230
We'II do her engagement on this wednesday,
and the marriage in the next month

1090
01:42:50,171 --> 01:42:52,401
Sister-in-Iaw, You are making tea
for me, Isn't it

1091
01:42:54,175 --> 01:42:55,039
You'II not eat
biscuits -

1092
01:42:55,276 --> 01:42:55,708
No

1093
01:42:55,944 --> 01:42:59,209
Great, I think hot tea is
being made

1094
01:42:59,447 --> 01:43:00,539
Come brother, come

1095
01:43:04,285 --> 01:43:05,547
Dhanraj has not
come

1096
01:43:05,787 --> 01:43:07,220
He has gone out
with him

1097
01:43:07,455 --> 01:43:08,046
I see

1098
01:43:08,289 --> 01:43:10,223
Brother, WiII you have
hot cutIets?

1099
01:43:10,458 --> 01:43:12,722
DefiniteIy

1100
01:43:12,961 --> 01:43:13,723
I'II just get them

1101
01:43:15,296 --> 01:43:17,264
Brother, somebody has
come

1102
01:43:24,672 --> 01:43:26,731
I have come to meet
Dhanraj

1103
01:43:27,008 --> 01:43:29,272
Whatever you want to say,
teII it to me

1104
01:43:29,511 --> 01:43:30,569
Then Iisten

1105
01:43:31,179 --> 01:43:35,115
Today Dhanraj's son, had a narrow
escape from my car -

1106
01:43:36,384 --> 01:43:41,651
His hurt must be ordinary, but the path
on which he is upto -

1107
01:43:42,190 --> 01:43:44,124
Its end resuIt is
not good

1108
01:43:44,359 --> 01:43:45,951
Where is Raj?

1109
01:43:46,194 --> 01:43:48,788
If he has not yet come,
he'II come

1110
01:43:49,030 --> 01:43:51,294
But, Today I have come to teII you
another news -

1111
01:43:51,533 --> 01:43:52,795
What news?

1112
01:43:53,034 --> 01:43:56,731
The Takur of Haripur,
his son Roop Singh's -

1113
01:43:57,005 --> 01:43:59,735
Engagement is being made with my daughter
Rashmi, on the next wednesday -

1114
01:44:00,008 --> 01:44:02,067
And marriage in the
next month

1115
01:44:03,344 --> 01:44:06,745
Dhanraj's son is trying to break
this reIation

1116
01:44:07,015 --> 01:44:07,947
This is not true

1117
01:44:08,183 --> 01:44:10,947
Today, he caIIed up my
daughter Rashmi -

1118
01:44:11,186 --> 01:44:12,619
And caIIed her to meet
outside

1119
01:44:12,854 --> 01:44:15,118
I saw both of them meeting
with my own eyes

1120
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:21,794
I'II make Rashmi
understand...

1121
01:44:22,363 --> 01:44:25,457
But, its your work to make
Raj understand

1122
01:44:27,035 --> 01:44:31,972
But, this is 100*/* true, that after today
if he tries to meet Rashmi -

1123
01:44:32,574 --> 01:44:35,338
Then, I'II not Ieave
him aIive

1124
01:44:57,031 --> 01:45:01,627
Don't mention anything about this
to Dhanraj -

1125
01:45:03,071 --> 01:45:04,299
Do you Iisten to what
I said?

1126
01:45:25,260 --> 01:45:26,693
But, how did this accident
take pIace ?

1127
01:45:26,928 --> 01:45:28,520
Don't know -

1128
01:45:28,930 --> 01:45:30,022
I was going on
my way -

1129
01:45:31,099 --> 01:45:33,693
SuddenIy a car came near me and
dashed against me and went off

1130
01:45:34,102 --> 01:45:35,194
IntentionaIIy

1131
01:45:36,304 --> 01:45:37,236
I thought it Iike
that

1132
01:45:38,473 --> 01:45:39,701
But, Who was this
person ?

1133
01:45:43,311 --> 01:45:45,245
Yes, Randhir Singh

1134
01:45:49,150 --> 01:45:51,243
Today, You caIIed
up Rashmi -

1135
01:45:53,321 --> 01:45:54,583
And, you aIso went to
meet her

1136
01:45:55,423 --> 01:45:57,015
How do you know
aII these?

1137
01:45:57,425 --> 01:45:59,689
Randhir Singh came here a
IittIe whiIe ago

1138
01:45:59,928 --> 01:46:01,520
Here, to our house

1139
01:46:01,763 --> 01:46:02,354
Yes

1140
01:46:03,097 --> 01:46:05,861
And, he has given a threat of kiIIing
you to death

1141
01:46:09,804 --> 01:46:10,862
Was Father aIso present
there?

1142
01:46:12,473 --> 01:46:12,905
No

1143
01:46:14,075 --> 01:46:15,770
UncIe, don't teII him anything
about this

1144
01:46:17,579 --> 01:46:18,011
Why?

1145
01:46:18,246 --> 01:46:20,544
He'II take everything
negative

1146
01:46:21,983 --> 01:46:24,975
And what's the
truth?

1147
01:46:28,156 --> 01:46:30,181
I never met Rashmi after
Sitanagar -

1148
01:46:31,492 --> 01:46:33,460
But it was important for me to
meet her atIeast once -

1149
01:46:33,995 --> 01:46:37,055
To make her understand that there's
nothing Ieft between us

1150
01:46:37,999 --> 01:46:40,433
Has everything got
over?

1151
01:46:41,502 --> 01:46:42,093
Yes

1152
01:46:45,473 --> 01:46:48,874
AIright, I'II not teII anything
to Dhanraj -

1153
01:46:50,278 --> 01:46:55,147
Just because, I have trust on
your words

1154
01:47:00,755 --> 01:47:01,585
Come inside

1155
01:47:12,934 --> 01:47:14,094
BaIwant, take care
of this

1156
01:47:14,335 --> 01:47:16,200
Mr.Dharam, tiII when wiII these peopIe
finish their work -

1157
01:47:16,471 --> 01:47:16,835
Tomorrow evening is
the engagement

1158
01:47:17,538 --> 01:47:19,335
Sister KamIa, you don't
worry -

1159
01:47:19,607 --> 01:47:21,438
By tomorrow afternoon, the entire
work wiII get over

1160
01:47:21,676 --> 01:47:22,665
Arey, Brother DharampaI

1161
01:47:27,282 --> 01:47:28,306
Here, this is the
finaI Iist

1162
01:47:28,549 --> 01:47:29,379
What Iist?

1163
01:47:29,617 --> 01:47:31,448
Arey, Don't we have to give presents to
the peopIe from the groom's side?

1164
01:47:31,686 --> 01:47:33,381
By evening, Everything shouId
be ready

1165
01:47:33,621 --> 01:47:34,053
AIright

1166
01:47:35,223 --> 01:47:36,315
And, Where are you
going?

1167
01:47:39,494 --> 01:47:42,657
Rashmi Iook,for few days forget
on going to the coIIege

1168
01:47:43,831 --> 01:47:46,823
After the engagement, Whether
you'II continue your studies or not -

1169
01:47:47,402 --> 01:47:49,768
This decision wiII be taken
by your wouId be

1170
01:47:50,038 --> 01:47:53,303
The decision about my Iife, wiII be taken by
that person, whom I don't even know

1171
01:47:53,541 --> 01:47:55,304
This is the practice of
our famiIies -

1172
01:47:55,977 --> 01:47:59,378
That after marriage the wife does
what her husband desires

1173
01:48:01,883 --> 01:48:03,544
Now, you go up to
your room

1174
01:48:30,712 --> 01:48:31,144
Grandma...

1175
01:48:33,114 --> 01:48:34,604
You are Rashmi's grandma,
Isn't it

1176
01:48:37,385 --> 01:48:38,283
My name is Raj

1177
01:48:41,956 --> 01:48:44,823
you peopIe have come to know
regarding mine and Rashmi's reIationship

1178
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:45,992
But...

1179
01:48:47,228 --> 01:48:50,061
Grandma, PIease teII me
this much -

1180
01:48:50,465 --> 01:48:51,830
That,has any kind of injustice been
done on Rashmi?

1181
01:48:52,066 --> 01:48:52,327
No

1182
01:48:53,301 --> 01:48:53,995
Is she aIright?

1183
01:48:54,635 --> 01:48:55,329
She is aIright -

1184
01:48:55,636 --> 01:48:58,730
And if you want to see her happy,
then stop foIIowing her

1185
01:49:00,408 --> 01:49:04,139
Because what ever you are doing, you'II
fetch nothing out of it

1186
01:49:04,846 --> 01:49:07,314
But, that innocent wiII have to undergo
severaI kinds of hardships

1187
01:49:08,950 --> 01:49:11,544
Tomorrow, its her engagement, and
very soon, the marriage -

1188
01:49:12,186 --> 01:49:14,177
Why are you bent upon in destroying
her Iife?

1189
01:49:15,623 --> 01:49:17,215
Who is destroying
who's Iife -

1190
01:49:17,959 --> 01:49:20,519
This is neither understandabIe by my
famiIy nor by yours -

1191
01:49:21,462 --> 01:49:24,795
And when you get the understanding, it
wiII be too Iate

1192
01:49:32,707 --> 01:49:36,643
Even after knowing, the chiId
that I am carrying,you are its father

1193
01:49:36,911 --> 01:49:39,778
Vibha, the girI who has aIready
bIemished her respect -

1194
01:49:40,014 --> 01:49:42,608
She is not fit to become the
daughter-in-Iaw of this famiIy

1195
01:49:42,850 --> 01:49:45,114

If he hasn't toId,

Your son repeatedIy caIIs up

He is trying to misguide my

And today, When my daughters engagement

Iast chance -

Thank you so much, for teIIing everything

Now everything wiII be done
in open

And, Iet me aIso
teII you -

1275
01:56:12,907 --> 01:56:16,741
That Rashmi and I are not prepared to
become the heirs of the hatred between you both

1276
01:56:19,079 --> 01:56:21,013
You and father do whatever you
feeI Iike -

1277
01:56:22,249 --> 01:56:25,776
But you peopIe, can never separate
me and Rashmi

1278
01:56:27,254 --> 01:56:27,845
Never

1279
01:56:28,088 --> 01:56:28,679
Never

1280
01:56:31,592 --> 01:56:32,183

Now, wiII you take his Iife out

DharampaI, Take this bastard and

1288
01:56:51,078 --> 01:56:53,410
And teII the gate keeper, if this bastard
is seen again -

1289
01:56:53,647 --> 01:56:55,740
Then break the head of this bastard,
Take him away

1290
01:56:55,983 --> 01:56:57,473
The son of a dog

1291
01:57:00,621 --> 01:57:02,020
Come on, take him
away

1292
01:57:03,591 --> 01:57:05,582
Kavita, Now why is
the deIay?

1293
01:57:08,696 --> 01:57:10,027
Ay, Go out
decentIy

1294
01:57:10,264 --> 01:57:11,253
Ay go out, go

1295
01:57:11,732 --> 01:57:12,164
Come on go out

1296
01:57:15,102 --> 01:57:17,536
Shut up, come inside, nobody shouId
come to know

1297
01:57:22,977 --> 01:57:27,175
Dhanraj, At this time, you are in a
very angry mood -

1298
01:57:28,682 --> 01:57:30,240
It's not sane for you
to speak to him

1299
01:57:31,819 --> 01:57:35,755
You go to your room, When he comes,
I'II speak to him

1300
01:57:36,156 --> 01:57:37,487
PreviousIy aIso, You onIy spoke
to him -

1301
01:57:38,826 --> 01:57:39,986
He spoke a Iie, in a very
fashioned manner -

1302
01:57:40,494 --> 01:57:41,756
And even you trusted
his words

1303
01:57:42,997 --> 01:57:43,929
I'II not caII that
a Iie

1304
01:57:45,499 --> 01:57:49,162
But, I'II caII it the regard for eIders, and the
respect for the same

1305
01:57:49,703 --> 01:57:52,171
If the regard and respect for eIders
wouId have been there -

1306
01:57:52,439 --> 01:57:54,430
Then, he wouIdn't have even taken her
name, after knowing the reaIity

1307
01:57:54,875 --> 01:57:59,005
But, It makes no difference on what his
famiIy underwent, what his father underwent

1308
01:57:59,246 --> 01:58:00,645
Dhanraj, this is
not true

1309
01:58:01,148 --> 01:58:02,513
Brother, This is onIy
the truth

1310
01:58:02,917 --> 01:58:05,078
How dare that bastard
Randhir Singh -

1311
01:58:05,319 --> 01:58:06,980
Give us threat, coming
to our house? -

1312
01:58:07,821 --> 01:58:11,348
TeIIing me over the teIephone, that
my son is on his mercy

1313
01:58:11,992 --> 01:58:12,981
What is this
insuIt for?

1314
01:58:14,261 --> 01:58:16,593
Just because my own son has
become so cheap -

1315
01:58:16,830 --> 01:58:20,596
That he is standing there with foIded
hands and begging for his Iove

1316
01:58:22,603 --> 01:58:25,094
Raj is going through a very
bad patch

1317
01:58:26,273 --> 01:58:28,434
CaII it Iove or
madness -

1318
01:58:28,976 --> 01:58:30,637
In this youthfuI age such stupidities
take pIace

1319
01:58:31,812 --> 01:58:35,145
At this time we shouIdn't be harsh but
make him understand with sympathy

1320
01:58:35,382 --> 01:58:35,973
Sympathy

1321
01:58:37,217 --> 01:58:40,152
Let him come, I'II bIoody teach
him a Iesson

1322
01:58:41,055 --> 01:58:42,317
So, what do you intend
doing?

1323
01:58:42,556 --> 01:58:43,818
Whatever I do, but you'II not
come in between

1324
01:58:44,058 --> 01:58:45,821
What wiII you do,
wiII you hit him?

1325
01:58:46,060 --> 01:58:46,651
Yes, I'II hit him

1326
01:58:47,895 --> 01:58:51,490
I'II beat him to puIp, so that he
even forgets that girI's name -

1327
01:58:51,899 --> 01:58:53,491
And you have no rights to
interfere in between

1328
01:59:02,543 --> 01:59:05,808
AIright, hit him

1329
01:59:08,215 --> 01:59:10,308
You are his father,
Isn't it

1330
01:59:12,553 --> 01:59:14,145
He means nothing
to me

1331
01:59:15,389 --> 01:59:18,825
What rights I have to speak
about him?

1332
01:59:20,561 --> 01:59:25,498
OnIy you did everything, you
brought him up -

1333
01:59:26,066 --> 01:59:30,503
Educated him and made him a
young man, What did I do?

1334
01:59:31,772 --> 01:59:33,000
Nothing

1335
01:59:37,111 --> 01:59:38,544
When he used to
feeI sick -

1336
01:59:39,780 --> 01:59:42,374
And when his body used to burn
with fever

1337
01:59:44,284 --> 01:59:50,052
Then, through out the night onIy you
used be awake by embracing him

1338
01:59:52,126 --> 01:59:56,392
By going to the tempIes, by undergoing
physicaI hardships -

1339
01:59:57,297 --> 01:59:59,561
OnIy you used to beg for
his Iife

1340
02:00:00,634 --> 02:00:02,727
What did I do,
nothing

1341
02:00:06,340 --> 02:00:10,106
Here, take this hit him, hit him to
your fuIIest satisfaction -

1342
02:00:10,677 --> 02:00:11,735
There shouIdn't be any room
for mercy Ieft

1343
02:00:12,346 --> 02:00:15,611
Hit him properIy, you made him a
young man onIy for this day,Isn't it

1344
02:00:36,537 --> 02:00:36,969

02:03:28,709 --> 02:03:28,936
Yes, I have given

02:03:29,209 --> 02:03:30,141
Sir, Thank you so much

1364
02:03:30,377 --> 02:03:31,935
May god show your daughters

02:03:33,380 --> 02:03:34,312

1367
02:03:34,548 --> 02:03:36,812
Yes, that I'II definiteIy become,

1368
02:03:40,721 --> 02:03:41,653
Bye Bye my chiId

1369
02:03:47,561 --> 02:03:49,654
Now if you wish, you can come and
sit near me

1370
02:03:52,232 --> 02:03:53,324
There is no danger

1371
02:03:59,039 --> 02:04:00,597
Now, Where wiII we go
to your house?

1372
02:04:01,708 --> 02:04:02,640
Stupid, to Raj's
house

1373
02:04:05,712 --> 02:04:06,474
How much?

1374
02:04:07,214 --> 02:04:08,476
You wait, I'II
come

1375
02:04:14,554 --> 02:04:15,486
What are you doing
over here?

1376
02:04:15,722 --> 02:04:16,654
I have brought Rashmi
aIong with me

1377
02:04:17,391 --> 02:04:18,483
She has ran away from
the house

1378
02:04:20,727 --> 02:04:21,489
CaII Raj

1379
02:04:22,229 --> 02:04:22,991
Go fast

1380
02:04:24,898 --> 02:04:28,163
Raj, Rashmi is outside, Kavita has
brought her

1381
02:04:30,604 --> 02:04:33,664
Raj, pack your Iuggage, you'II have to
run away from the house

1382
02:04:54,294 --> 02:04:55,488
Raj, keep this
money

1383
02:04:57,230 --> 02:04:57,992
You'II need them

1384
02:05:10,777 --> 02:05:11,835
DharampaI, did you come to know
anything?

1385
02:05:12,279 --> 02:05:13,371
They both are not
over there

1386
02:05:15,615 --> 02:05:17,378
Dhanraj, didn't even speak
to me -

1387
02:05:18,285 --> 02:05:19,547
But Jaswant was
teIIing -

1388
02:05:20,620 --> 02:05:23,885
That by mid-night, Raj went somewhere
out on his motor cycIe -

1389
02:05:24,624 --> 02:05:27,718
He has no idea as to whether he went
aIone or aIong with Rashmi

1390
02:05:27,961 --> 02:05:29,553
That bastard is speaking
a Iie

1391
02:05:30,464 --> 02:05:33,729
Entire famiIy is responsibIe in misguiding
and making Rashmi run away

1392
02:05:34,301 --> 02:05:37,395
But why don't you intimate the poIice
to arrest them aII

1393
02:05:37,671 --> 02:05:40,105
No, don't even take the name
of poIice -

1394
02:05:41,174 --> 02:05:44,575
The stupidity that Rashmi has done,
We'II have to keep it a secret -

1395
02:05:45,512 --> 02:05:47,446
And she must have not gone very far
She must be in DeIhi onIy -

1396
02:05:47,681 --> 02:05:48,613
We'II definiteIy search
her -

1397
02:05:49,516 --> 02:05:52,781
And we'II get her married with
Roop Singh in the next month

1398
02:05:54,020 --> 02:05:56,386
UncIe, I have brought the fuII
information -

1399
02:05:56,623 --> 02:05:58,557
They both have Ieft on the motor cycIe
towards the Agra road -

1400
02:05:58,792 --> 02:06:02,558
And yesterday night, they fiIIed the fueI
on the DeIhi border fueI station -

1401
02:06:02,796 --> 02:06:04,058
And they aIso asked for the way
to Indore

1402
02:06:22,849 --> 02:06:23,281
What happened?

1403
02:06:26,019 --> 02:06:26,951
The gear box has got
bursted

1404
02:06:27,687 --> 02:06:28,119
What?

1405
02:06:29,356 --> 02:06:30,448
Can't it get
aIright?

1406
02:06:40,534 --> 02:06:42,126
Look, you stop that
truck

1407
02:06:42,369 --> 02:06:42,960
No...

1408
02:06:43,236 --> 02:06:44,669
Listen to me, It can't get
repaired

1409
02:06:45,572 --> 02:06:48,632
I'II hide this, you go and
stop the truck, go -

1410
02:06:48,909 --> 02:06:51,969
And Iisten, he shouIdn't have the
sIighest of doubts, that we have eIoped

1411
02:07:00,687 --> 02:07:01,619
What's the matter?

1412
02:07:01,855 --> 02:07:02,947
I need a Iift

1413
02:07:03,190 --> 02:07:04,452
Oh, yes, yes, yes,
come, come, come

1414
02:07:04,691 --> 02:07:07,125
I'II drop you, Arey Pandu, just make
the chiId get up

1415
02:07:10,197 --> 02:07:10,788
Who is he?

1416
02:07:11,698 --> 02:07:12,790
He is with me

1417
02:07:14,701 --> 02:07:16,134
AIright, We'II even
drop him

1418
02:07:16,703 --> 02:07:17,635
You come, come

1419
02:07:29,082 --> 02:07:30,014
What is the next
viIIage?

1420
02:07:37,924 --> 02:07:38,515
How far is it?

1421
02:07:39,092 --> 02:07:39,683
20 miIes

1422
02:07:56,743 --> 02:07:57,175
What happened?

1423
02:07:58,245 --> 02:07:58,802
I'II check up

1424
02:08:04,751 --> 02:08:06,514
The Iiquor smeII is coming from
his mouth

1425
02:08:08,255 --> 02:08:09,187
What to do?

1426
02:08:14,928 --> 02:08:16,361
We have to take the bone out
from the chicken

1427
02:08:16,596 --> 02:08:17,028
But how?

1428
02:08:17,764 --> 02:08:20,358
We'II make him get down, in the guise
of pushing the truck

1429
02:08:20,600 --> 02:08:20,861
AIright

1430
02:08:22,102 --> 02:08:24,195
The truck has to be
given a push

1431
02:08:24,638 --> 02:08:25,195
Yes, Yes

1432
02:08:25,972 --> 02:08:26,529
Ay sir

1433
02:08:36,650 --> 02:08:37,241
Arey, Where have they
gone?

1434
02:08:40,320 --> 02:08:40,752
ShouId I search?

1435
02:08:40,987 --> 02:08:41,578
Ay, shut-up and
come

1436
02:09:07,647 --> 02:09:08,739
Raj, Now what
to do?

1437
02:09:25,665 --> 02:09:26,256
Come, Iet's go
and see

1438
02:09:44,050 --> 02:09:47,645
Rashmi, There cannot be any other better
pIace than this

1439
02:09:48,221 --> 02:09:50,485
Are you aIso thinking the same,
what I am thinking?

1440
02:09:52,058 --> 02:09:53,992
And...this is our drawing
room

1441
02:09:54,561 --> 02:09:55,152
And...

1442
02:09:55,562 --> 02:09:56,494
That is our bedroom

1443
02:09:59,232 --> 02:10:01,666
And this, this is our
kitchen

1444
02:10:01,901 --> 02:10:02,993
There is just a
roIIer missing

1445
02:10:03,737 --> 02:10:05,705
Come, Iet's go and see how our
rose garden is?

1446
02:10:11,778 --> 02:10:12,836
This is a reaI
heaven

1447
02:10:13,780 --> 02:10:15,543
Look, even the dweIIing area is not
very far

1448
02:10:16,783 --> 02:10:18,876
If, you Iike the pIace, then
shouId we give the rent

1449
02:10:19,786 --> 02:10:20,218
Rent?

1450
02:10:20,453 --> 02:10:21,215
Yes, come

1451
02:11:06,633 --> 02:11:07,725
Son, did you come to
know anything?

1452
02:11:08,635 --> 02:11:12,901
You reaIIy don't know or you are scared
that I come to know

1453
02:11:16,176 --> 02:11:19,270
Don't worry, I'II definiteIy
find him

1454
02:11:25,351 --> 02:11:28,787
Look, the girIs name is not given onIy
to save her from the dis-respect -

1455
02:11:29,856 --> 02:11:32,290
And a reward of Rs.1 ,00,000 to
reach tiII Raj

1456
02:11:35,695 --> 02:11:38,289
I don't want to say, but Raj's Iife
is in danger

1457
02:11:46,573 --> 02:11:49,838
Randhir Singh, I am
Dhanraj -

1458
02:11:51,745 --> 02:11:54,179
You have given my son's photo
in the news paper -

1459
02:11:55,682 --> 02:11:57,274
But, remember one
thing -

1460
02:11:58,518 --> 02:12:00,611
Even if a scratch comes on
my son Raj -

1461
02:12:02,021 --> 02:12:04,114
Then, even today I am the
same Dhanraj -

1462
02:12:05,358 --> 02:12:07,451
What I was
14 years ago

1463
02:12:09,028 --> 02:12:09,619
Who was it?

1464
02:12:10,363 --> 02:12:10,795
Nobody

1465
02:12:12,699 --> 02:12:13,131
Give me

1466
02:12:14,200 --> 02:12:14,632
How much?

1467
02:12:14,868 --> 02:12:15,300
46 Rupees

1468
02:12:15,869 --> 02:12:16,801
And, give me those
eggs

1469
02:12:17,070 --> 02:12:17,468
How many?

1470
02:12:17,871 --> 02:12:18,303
Six

1471
02:12:34,754 --> 02:12:37,018
Arey, What's aII this that you
have bought?

1472
02:12:38,091 --> 02:12:38,682
Look at this

1473
02:12:43,930 --> 02:12:46,023
kept at the
grocer's shop -

1474
02:12:46,933 --> 02:12:47,865
I steaIthiIy brought
it

1475
02:12:48,935 --> 02:12:50,027
Did anyone see?

1476
02:12:50,637 --> 02:12:51,069
No

1477
02:12:57,577 --> 02:13:02,514
From today, whatever has to be bought
from the viIIage, I'II go and get it

1478
02:13:04,083 --> 02:13:05,345
It is not required for another
few days -

1479
02:13:05,919 --> 02:13:07,181
Because, I have brought the ration for
the entire 8 days

1480
02:13:08,421 --> 02:13:09,012
Ration ...

1481
02:13:09,422 --> 02:13:12,016
Yes, these bags contain
Rice, Spices etc

1482
02:13:12,425 --> 02:13:13,858
In this bag there are a few
vegetabIes -

1483
02:13:14,093 --> 02:13:16,186
And, in that bag, the vesseIs for
cooking

1484
02:13:17,096 --> 02:13:18,358
Oh god, feeIing very
hungry

1485
02:13:18,765 --> 02:13:20,858
Do one thing, make hot
Roti's

1486
02:13:21,601 --> 02:13:22,033
Roti's

1487
02:13:22,268 --> 02:13:24,862
And...,BrinjaI curry

1488
02:13:26,639 --> 02:13:27,367
BrinjaI curry

1489
02:13:27,640 --> 02:13:29,574
Yes, I'II go and get some bamboo's
for the roof

1490
02:14:17,323 --> 02:14:19,086
It Iooks as if, its going to rain
tonight -

1491
02:14:19,826 --> 02:14:20,758
I'II have to make the
roof fast

1492
02:14:23,997 --> 02:14:25,760
Arey, what happened?

1493
02:14:27,667 --> 02:14:32,104
Oh, Oh, These roti's have got
roasted a IittIe more -

1494
02:14:34,540 --> 02:14:36,474
Arey, no probIem, We'II prepare
something eIse

1495
02:14:37,877 --> 02:14:40,471
Raj, I don't know anything
to cook -

1496
02:14:41,714 --> 02:14:43,978
I have never Iearnt anything in the
whoIe of my Iife -

1497
02:14:44,217 --> 02:14:45,479
Oh, my god, its my
mistake -

1498
02:14:46,219 --> 02:14:49,154
I shouId have atIeast asked you, Whether
you know cooking or not?

1499
02:14:49,389 --> 02:14:49,821
Isn't it?

1500
02:14:51,057 --> 02:14:52,991
Raj, I know
nothing

1501
02:14:54,727 --> 02:14:58,424
In the due course, you'II get to know
aII my weaknesses -

1502
02:14:59,499 --> 02:15:01,933
And,one day you'II repent to have
Ioved me

1503
02:15:02,502 --> 02:15:05,096
Rashmi, even I have a Iot of
weaknesses -

1504
02:15:05,705 --> 02:15:07,639
So, wiII you stop Ioving me,
because of these

1505
02:15:08,541 --> 02:15:08,973
TeII me

1506
02:15:14,881 --> 02:15:16,314
Then, how can I get annoyed
of you

1507
02:15:20,386 --> 02:15:21,978
Rashmi, I Iove you
a Iot -

1508
02:15:23,389 --> 02:15:26,324
I am prepared to face aII the
hurdIes of the worId -

1509
02:15:27,393 --> 02:15:28,485
I just need, you to stand

1510
02:15:29,896 --> 02:15:30,157

1511
02:20:10,209 --> 02:20:14,475
Mr.Pratap Singh, You don't worry, We'II

02:20:19,885 --> 02:20:20,647

DharampaI, How Iong wiII I

1515
02:20:24,390 --> 02:20:25,982
UncIe, I have known Rashmi's
whereabouts?

1516
02:20:26,225 --> 02:20:26,657
Where is she?

1517
02:20:26,892 --> 02:20:27,324
Look at this -

1518
02:20:29,395 --> 02:20:32,489
On the Indore road, further to Nandipur,
near the hiIIock of Hanuman -

1519
02:20:32,732 --> 02:20:34,996
There is a broken tempIe, both of them
stay over there

1520
02:20:36,402 --> 02:20:40,498
Near the Nandipur viIIage, in the hiIIock
of Hanuman

1521
02:20:40,773 --> 02:20:41,205
Yes

1522
02:20:42,942 --> 02:20:44,000
Is there any popuIated area
near by?

1523
02:20:44,277 --> 02:20:46,211
No, there is no popuIation tiII
atIeast 2 miIes

1524
02:20:47,446 --> 02:20:48,037
AIright

1525
02:21:04,397 --> 02:21:06,331
I am sorry for coming here without
the permission

1526
02:21:07,066 --> 02:21:08,158
I was heIpIess

1527
02:21:10,736 --> 02:21:13,204
I am Randhir Singh's
mother

1528
02:21:16,275 --> 02:21:20,177
I have come here to beg for Rashmi's
and Raj's Iife

1529
02:21:23,115 --> 02:21:25,379
Randhir, has come to know, as to where
they both are?

1530
02:21:26,118 --> 02:21:28,712
I am scared, that Raj's Iife
is in danger

1531
02:21:28,954 --> 02:21:30,216
Mother, What are you
teIIing? -

1532
02:21:30,456 --> 02:21:31,548
Where is my son?

1533
02:21:34,627 --> 02:21:35,719
How do you know
aII these?

1534
02:21:36,295 --> 02:21:37,728
I couIdn't Iisten to
everything -

1535
02:21:38,297 --> 02:21:40,891
But he has now got the
whereabouts of those two

1536
02:21:41,634 --> 02:21:44,068
He is going there tomorrow morning
without anybody's notification

1537
02:21:44,637 --> 02:21:46,104
So, you have come here to
take us there

1538
02:21:46,339 --> 02:21:48,773
Yes my son, I don't want that
Raj and Rashmi...

1539
02:21:49,008 --> 02:21:49,940
I am thankfuI
to you -

1540
02:21:52,178 --> 02:21:53,770
But if your fear, turns out
to be true -

1541
02:21:55,781 --> 02:21:56,873
Then, there wiII be a
big disaster

1542
02:22:34,854 --> 02:22:36,116
Here, take this
60,000 Rs -

1543
02:22:37,857 --> 02:22:39,449
And Rs.60,000 after the work
gets accompIished

1544
02:22:41,527 --> 02:22:42,289
Your name

1545
02:22:43,028 --> 02:22:44,461
There is no need
for it

1546
02:22:45,464 --> 02:22:47,830
We were toId, that money was your
onIy concern

1547
02:22:50,202 --> 02:22:50,964
Who is the
target?

1548
02:22:51,404 --> 02:22:55,101
Even he has no name, We'II take
you to him

1549
02:22:55,841 --> 02:22:57,604
He stays aIone in a
deserted pIace

1550
02:22:58,511 --> 02:22:59,569
There is no one eIse to
watch

1551
02:23:02,348 --> 02:23:03,508
What if there is someone,
then

1552
02:23:04,517 --> 02:23:05,711
KiII that person aIso

1553
02:23:06,519 --> 02:23:10,114
The price for every murder wiII be
Rs.1 ,00,000

1554
02:23:10,790 --> 02:23:12,052
AIright

1555
02:23:13,325 --> 02:23:15,987
But remember, there shouId not be any
witness Ieft -

1556
02:23:17,263 --> 02:23:19,197
And, even the whereabouts of the dead body
shouId not be known -

1557
02:23:20,132 --> 02:23:22,396
AIright, get the baIance amount,

02:23:50,796 --> 02:23:52,855
Its going to be evening, and I have to
go to the forest for cutting wood -

1560
02:23:53,466 --> 02:23:56,526
Go, tomorrow in the morning,
don't go now

1561
02:23:57,336 --> 02:23:58,268
There is no
wood at aII -

1562
02:23:58,971 --> 02:24:01,599
Neither, the dinner wiII get cooked,
nor wiII the morning tea be made

1563
02:24:07,713 --> 02:24:08,304
Listen

1564
02:24:09,782 --> 02:24:13,115
It's very easy to make french fries,
that I'II definiteIy make -

1565
02:24:13,853 --> 02:24:15,320
And you'II aIso
Iike it

1566
02:24:18,858 --> 02:24:22,988
Today instead of Roti's, I'II make hot
sandwiches, reaIIy hot ones

1567
02:24:30,336 --> 02:24:32,395
How Iong wiII
it take?

1568
02:24:33,639 --> 02:24:34,401
Just one hour

1569
02:24:37,710 --> 02:24:38,039
Listen

1570
02:24:39,912 --> 02:24:40,344

Now you go, Now 1 hour wiII easiIy

1572
02:24:58,764 --> 02:24:59,059
What's this for?

1573
02:24:59,665 --> 02:25:00,859
It can even take
2 hours

1574
02:25:16,715 --> 02:25:17,374
There he is

1575
02:25:26,659 --> 02:25:27,057
What happened?

1576
02:25:27,860 --> 02:25:28,451
Is he the one?

1577
02:25:36,802 --> 02:25:38,326
But, we need the proof of
his death

1578
02:25:39,171 --> 02:25:41,264
Both his cut
hands -

1579
02:25:43,909 --> 02:25:44,238
WiII that be
enough?

1580
02:25:59,124 --> 02:25:59,783
What happened?

1581
02:26:00,125 --> 02:26:01,057
They have gone back
of Raj

1582
02:26:02,127 --> 02:26:04,595
Are you sure, that the men you have
brought wiII they accompIish their work?

1583
02:26:05,064 --> 02:26:05,860
DefiniteIy

1584
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:11,197
If anybody comes here,
