1
00:03:38,353 --> 00:03:39,554
Balaraman,

2
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:40,649
yes

3
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:42,919
a vehicle has come

4
00:03:43,213 --> 00:03:44,223
is it?

5
00:03:52,702 --> 00:03:55,131
what a high fever!

6
00:03:55,604 --> 00:03:56,641
He has also vomited

7
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,838
some blood tests have been done

8
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:01,819
don't know the details

9
00:04:02,066 --> 00:04:02,988
how is he now?

10
00:04:03,075 --> 00:04:05,592
the difficulties have subsided a little bit

11
00:04:05,771 --> 00:04:07,789
can we see uncle now?

12
00:04:07,962 --> 00:04:11,026
not allowed to see him even in
daytime, then how is it possible at night?

13
00:04:11,232 --> 00:04:13,358
one cannot go past that accountant Menon
who is guarding him.

14
00:04:13,546 --> 00:04:16,751
on receiving the telegram l
thought it is serious why simply

15
00:04:16,776 --> 00:04:19,874
troubling us Menon, when he
catches just a fever and cold?

16
00:04:19,996 --> 00:04:24,206
no, now a days we must be
careful even if it is a sneeze

17
00:04:24,717 --> 00:04:27,750
there should not be space for complaints if
anything happens

18
00:04:28,109 --> 00:04:31,352
that Menon did not inform us

19
00:04:31,378 --> 00:04:33,065
is sister, children and all here?

20
00:04:33,161 --> 00:04:34,001
where else will they go?

21
00:04:34,281 --> 00:04:38,002
everybody is here even
the His Highness old

22
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:42,508
Mathilakam uncle has reached
with grandson Balaraman

23
00:04:43,991 --> 00:04:46,517
ha ha ha ha.

24
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:53,215
so Subhadra Varma from Madras
too has arrived, ha ha ha ha

25
00:04:53,535 --> 00:04:56,525
Does anybody remain?

26
00:04:56,876 --> 00:04:59,090
Janaki had a son

27
00:04:59,622 --> 00:05:04,397
one black Varma in
Bombay what about him?

28
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:08,813
it seems he hasn't come; because such a
man was not seen in the mess hall

29
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,412
no, there is no question of him not coming

30
00:05:11,507 --> 00:05:17,184
grandpa,yes, don't we have to present our
case before uncle His Highness dies?

31
00:05:17,378 --> 00:05:18,944
Yes we have to,

32
00:05:19,854 --> 00:05:23,159
but wait, but wait

33
00:05:25,681 --> 00:05:28,161
one vehicle has come, it seems

34
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:31,583
yes, its an auto rickshaw

35
00:05:31,929 --> 00:05:33,354
it must be him

36
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:34,353
who?

37
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:35,664
Janaki's son

38
00:05:40,002 --> 00:05:41,543
do you know how long l
have been waiting for

39
00:05:41,568 --> 00:05:43,074
you? you said you will
come at noon, isn't?

40
00:05:43,489 --> 00:05:45,517
yes, the flight scheduled
to land at Kochi, landed

41
00:05:45,542 --> 00:05:47,489
at Thiruvananthapuram from
there l came in a bus

42
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:50,473
train was preferable now how
much money you must have lost?

43
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:51,664
leave it. How is uncle?

44
00:05:51,857 --> 00:05:55,139
they say he is better, how
can we know the truth?

45
00:05:55,403 --> 00:05:57,092
hope mom and dad were with uncle only

46
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,158
how is it possible? We were
allowed to see him only once

47
00:06:00,374 --> 00:06:00,825
why?

48
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,259
His Highness is getting more short-tempered
and stubborn as be grows older

49
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:11,037
now he doesn't like us that secretary Raman
Menon is more powerful than His Highness.

50
00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:16,814
it should have been nice if our Guptan gets
some money or land before brother dies

51
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:20,722
that accountant Menon told that His
Highness has fixed everybody's

52
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:24,049
share in his will, but will
get it only after his death.

53
00:06:24,234 --> 00:06:25,464
whom else to give?

54
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:30,349
No children. And Her Highness needs no
money or property

55
00:06:30,518 --> 00:06:32,867
l am sure that share of sustenance has
been allocated

56
00:06:33,062 --> 00:06:33,982
are you sure?

57
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:38,176
yes, we will be given a bit more
than what he gives to others

58
00:06:38,502 --> 00:06:43,071
Because brother Highness is one who
respects art and artists. another thing

59
00:06:43,096 --> 00:06:47,362
is that l am the only Brahmin who had
married a woman from this family

60
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:51,504
even now, l will be given a
gift if l perform Kathakali

61
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:55,458
when he is in a good mood,
see, you remember this ring?

62
00:06:55,797 --> 00:06:58,723
that was his present in recognition
of my enactment of Roudra Bhima

63
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:02,457
you are in fool's paradise oh lord,
My brother

64
00:07:02,482 --> 00:07:05,936
had selected such a foolish
Namboodiri for me.

65
00:07:06,278 --> 00:07:09,797
though you are born in a Royal
family, it is you who is a fool

66
00:07:10,568 --> 00:07:13,852
brother Highness knows very
well for what you, your

67
00:07:13,877 --> 00:07:16,844
sisters, and their husbands
are roaming around

68
00:07:17,127 --> 00:07:19,713
brother will like us if
we remain cool without

69
00:07:19,738 --> 00:07:22,574
showing greed for money and property.
also his soft

70
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:25,240
corner for me as an artist
l am sure that if he

71
00:07:25,265 --> 00:07:27,905
gives anything with
pleasure, it will be to us.

72
00:07:37,895 --> 00:07:38,948
Mom, you feel cold?

73
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,837
please dry mom's hair once again
Saraswati, let me take that saffron box

74
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:48,173
l will take the saffron
box Her Highness will get

75
00:07:48,198 --> 00:07:50,387
annoyed in the morning
itself if l dry her hair

76
00:07:57,565 --> 00:08:00,063
enough, lt's time
for Unni's arrival

77
00:08:00,097 --> 00:08:03,183
His face will turn dark if l won't
wait in the balcony when he comes

78
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:07,806
have you seen Unni, my girl?

79
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,233
no

80
00:08:35,814 --> 00:08:38,028
Unni is fooling all of us

81
00:08:38,803 --> 00:08:40,611
he is mischievous

82
00:08:42,302 --> 00:08:44,821
how many days have l
been waiting like this?

83
00:08:49,878 --> 00:08:52,577
here comes Unni.

84
00:08:57,145 --> 00:08:57,877
good morning

85
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:02,115
that's prince guptan

86
00:09:02,631 --> 00:09:03,318
What?

87
00:09:03,452 --> 00:09:05,523
son of princess Madhavi

88
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,429
tell him to go away

89
00:09:13,825 --> 00:09:15,643
Unni won't come today also, is it?

90
00:09:16,162 --> 00:09:18,276
But he will come one day

91
00:09:24,194 --> 00:09:27,902
His Highness has woke up you
are called, the manager said

92
00:09:30,351 --> 00:09:33,277
yes, its Raman Menon, secretary
of Udayanapuram Palace

93
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,960
no

94
00:09:35,623 --> 00:09:36,933
he is in bed rest

95
00:09:37,401 --> 00:09:38,129
no

96
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:39,349
Yes

97
00:09:39,823 --> 00:09:41,398
sorry, it's not possible

98
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:42,781
l will tell him

99
00:09:43,642 --> 00:09:44,312
oh, what a problem!

100
00:09:44,749 --> 00:09:45,921
see Menon,

101
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:47,732
we are all his relatives, no?

102
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:49,779
why this hostility?

103
00:09:49,939 --> 00:09:52,966
nothing, no use feeling bad about me

104
00:09:53,272 --> 00:09:55,509
l can only obey what he orders

105
00:09:55,922 --> 00:09:58,488
His order is not to let anybody upstairs

106
00:09:58,543 --> 00:09:59,886
but the collector visited him yesterday

107
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:00,523
that's right

108
00:10:00,622 --> 00:10:04,154
but his sisters and nephews don't have that
privilege

109
00:10:04,199 --> 00:10:06,526
what wrong did we do to deserve this?

110
00:10:06,605 --> 00:10:08,258
sister, you are staying here

111
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:12,813
but we started instantly the moment we got
the telegram informing about his sickness

112
00:10:12,838 --> 00:10:16,834
that too in car Menon, do you know how
much it costs to reach here from Madras?

113
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,191
whatever it be, l will arrange the
amount if you give the voucher

114
00:10:23,179 --> 00:10:27,679
we are not so cheap, we came rushing
not for His Highness's property

115
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,597
if it was so, we would have stayed in this
palace

116
00:10:31,238 --> 00:10:36,011
some others have reached here
after we are not like them

117
00:10:36,288 --> 00:10:39,285
Kesavapillai should not say that

118
00:10:39,646 --> 00:10:42,646
we are called by His Highness to stay here

119
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:45,891
only we are there to think
about and sympathise with him

120
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:48,479
you are all enjoying
life at far away places

121
00:10:48,813 --> 00:10:50,602
from now none of you
need trouble yourselves,

122
00:10:50,881 --> 00:10:52,505
l will look after my brother's matters

123
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,472
Look, l am not going back to Madras

124
00:10:55,942 --> 00:11:00,100
l use to say this since long back, there
will not be anybody to look after uncle's

125
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:03,881
matters if we are not here, so l am
also leaving this palace for anywhere.

126
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:05,154
Then what about your studies?

127
00:11:05,341 --> 00:11:07,990
Studies come only after this
His Highness is my first preference

128
00:11:08,392 --> 00:11:10,465
l was really shocked
hearing about his illness

129
00:11:10,861 --> 00:11:13,503
ha ha ha.

130
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:17,962
Menon, squeeze some onion into
his eyes let him cry lavishly

131
00:11:18,324 --> 00:11:22,028
don't tease, He is the successor
of His Highness Knowing that

132
00:11:22,053 --> 00:11:25,994
very well, my dear brother His
Highness named him Raja Raja Varma

133
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:34,044
who will become the Highness after
Udaya Varma? Subhadra's son? Ha ha ha

134
00:11:34,047 --> 00:11:36,196
l am the eldest among the nephews

135
00:11:36,444 --> 00:11:40,105
Not only that, he is not
born to a low-caste father

136
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:43,790
His father is an original
Varma of Attingal palace.

137
00:11:44,081 --> 00:11:47,229
though my husband is
low-caste, He is well-educated

138
00:11:47,254 --> 00:11:50,521
and dignified unlike your
husband who is not well off

139
00:11:50,638 --> 00:11:51,729
please stop it.

140
00:11:52,464 --> 00:11:55,077
this is why he is not allowing to see him

141
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,019
See, l'll tell His Highness if
you are again going to quarrel

142
00:11:59,448 --> 00:12:02,877
and that will be the end of your
entry to this palace, l warn

143
00:12:04,548 --> 00:12:05,572
Where were you my girl?

144
00:12:05,757 --> 00:12:07,003
l was with mom

145
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,120
His Highness has been asking about
you for some time,Go to him

146
00:12:12,343 --> 00:12:17,078
that low-cast girl has all the
freedom, calling the King dad,

147
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:21,915
calling the queen mom, we born
of the same blood ignored. hmm.

148
00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:24,418
You said you are out

149
00:12:25,685 --> 00:12:28,851
you will be out forever without delay

150
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:33,988
this is for everyone's
information, Oh My Lord.

151
00:12:45,082 --> 00:12:46,213
has he awaken?

152
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,092
yes, then again fell asleep

153
00:12:49,361 --> 00:12:50,623
didn't give the medicine?

154
00:12:50,677 --> 00:12:54,873
No, didn't disturb as he was sleeping, l
thought will wake him up after you come

155
00:12:57,055 --> 00:13:00,511
Dad, Dad

156
00:13:06,824 --> 00:13:08,042
Fever is gone

157
00:13:09,565 --> 00:13:10,712
Where were you my girl?

158
00:13:10,967 --> 00:13:12,467
l was with mom

159
00:13:14,465 --> 00:13:15,712
is her waiting over?

160
00:13:15,981 --> 00:13:17,844
l left after taking her to bed

161
00:13:18,143 --> 00:13:19,534
cried a little today

162
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:23,948
couldn't sleep yesterday

163
00:13:24,439 --> 00:13:26,999
So many vehicles came

164
00:13:27,326 --> 00:13:28,885
there was loud noise below

165
00:13:29,678 --> 00:13:30,966
everybody has come

166
00:13:31,087 --> 00:13:32,713
it was l who informed people
at Madras and Kottakal

167
00:13:32,969 --> 00:13:35,753
who told you to gave
such a wide publicity?.

168
00:13:36,102 --> 00:13:38,746
won't you give me some peace of mind
even when l am bedridden?

169
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:43,211
excuse me, Highness l was worried
when you vomited and fainted

170
00:13:43,508 --> 00:13:46,450
you thought l am finished?

171
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:49,828
don't feel annoyed, l
haven't even dreamt of such

172
00:13:49,853 --> 00:13:52,605
a thing. only your sisters
are informed the news

173
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,249
then how the news appeared
in the newspaper?

174
00:13:54,448 --> 00:13:56,003
that too was a fault on my side

175
00:13:56,404 --> 00:14:01,036
why make it a news even if l sneeze?
the phone bell is ringing, that Raman

176
00:14:01,061 --> 00:14:05,444
Menon is fed up of answering calls.
the ministers and MLAs are calling

177
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:06,861
won't repeat it

178
00:14:06,907 --> 00:14:09,415

179
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:12,711
you have to follow our orders,
you got my point?

180
00:14:13,484 --> 00:14:15,105
Kunjikrishnan, Yes my lord

181
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:17,099

182
00:14:17,316 --> 00:14:18,196
as you wish.

183
00:14:20,938 --> 00:14:25,055
sisters and children have
come, they insist to see you

184
00:14:25,204 --> 00:14:26,003
for what?

185
00:14:26,387 --> 00:14:30,874
aren't they satisfied with what
they have seen? an abnormal

186
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:34,863
lady is living here, nobody
wants to see or hear her

187
00:14:35,719 --> 00:14:39,237
how can we say no to people
who have come from afar?

188
00:14:39,674 --> 00:14:41,272
let them come when l die

189
00:14:41,917 --> 00:14:44,699
tell them everybody's share is allocated

190
00:14:45,233 --> 00:14:46,086
what a disturbance!

191
00:14:46,648 --> 00:14:49,793
in the end Bhagirathi
will become orphan

192
00:14:53,486 --> 00:14:58,067
don't forget her even after my
death though not your mother,

193
00:14:58,092 --> 00:15:02,371
you are used to call her so
consider her as your mother.

194
00:15:04,644 --> 00:15:06,559
l know you will

195
00:15:07,252 --> 00:15:10,799
l too have seen you as daughter,
not as adopted daughter

196
00:15:13,137 --> 00:15:16,339
Menon, shall l take a bath?

197
00:15:17,151 --> 00:15:20,152
you can, but you want
it today itself?

198
00:15:20,222 --> 00:15:23,858
yes l want, the present uneasiness
is because l am not taking bath

199
00:15:24,053 --> 00:15:25,978
l will take medicine and
breakfast only after that

200
00:15:28,554 --> 00:15:30,730
you pluck flower just like
Kalamandalam, Appukutty

201
00:15:30,755 --> 00:15:33,187
Aasan's Damayanthi doing it,
in Nalacharitham Kathakali.

202
00:15:33,653 --> 00:15:35,523
hey, your face is blushed

203
00:15:35,795 --> 00:15:37,412
why troubling me like this?

204
00:15:37,426 --> 00:15:41,559
troubling? why Radha says like this?
l am saying so out of love

205
00:15:41,724 --> 00:15:43,813
you need not like me, please go

206
00:15:44,119 --> 00:15:46,927
Princess Madhavi will
scold me if she sees this

207
00:15:46,953 --> 00:15:52,658
l am the love beetle roaming around
the beautiful flower called Radha,

208
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:54,536
A beetle, beetle

209
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:55,507
Hello beetle,

210
00:15:56,326 --> 00:15:58,811
what's this? Courting
panchali or Naladamayanti?

211
00:15:59,013 --> 00:16:00,260
in which drama are you acting?

212
00:16:05,061 --> 00:16:06,530
where are you going? Stay there!

213
00:16:07,838 --> 00:16:10,137
don't try to dance and flirt
in front of the lords,

214
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:13,692
no use crying if anything happens

215
00:16:14,065 --> 00:16:15,483
l didn't say anything

216
00:16:15,627 --> 00:16:16,165
it was he

217
00:16:16,454 --> 00:16:17,673
no explanation

218
00:16:18,076 --> 00:16:23,424
A few more boys have come here
innocent boys don't try to seduce them

219
00:16:23,687 --> 00:16:26,975
don't scold her Madhavi,
let that poor girl go

220
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,790
hmm, poor girl?

221
00:16:29,037 --> 00:16:30,818
take her with you if she is poor

222
00:16:31,531 --> 00:16:33,808
no need to cry for sympathy
crocodile tears

223
00:16:34,066 --> 00:16:34,845
what there sister?

224
00:16:35,104 --> 00:16:37,016
she has started showing
her mom's character

225
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,750
and l was telling her not
to try it on our children

226
00:16:39,428 --> 00:16:44,484
in the past when her mom conceived a
bastard the princes had to take the blame.

227
00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:49,381
at last when she was questioned in detail,
that milkman Nair was found responsible

228
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,076
let me go princess

229
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,791
hmm, you may go

230
00:16:53,185 --> 00:16:56,578
and tell all that we said and
not said to His Highness

231
00:16:56,624 --> 00:16:58,855
the princess of Udayanapuram palace!

232
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:04,054
what a pitiable plight for us!
the girl who was delivered

233
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,701
by a sweeper is now in a
higher position above us

234
00:17:08,086 --> 00:17:11,880
why blaming others? blame it
on our brother His Highness

235
00:17:12,127 --> 00:17:16,935
he knows everything,
we have two daughters who are grown-up

236
00:17:17,533 --> 00:17:20,546
can't he give his nephews the position
that a low-caste girl is given?

237
00:17:21,735 --> 00:17:24,094
its high time my children got married

238
00:17:24,414 --> 00:17:25,573
that's also right

239
00:17:26,472 --> 00:17:30,249
wont l manage the Nilagiri estate
better if l am given the charge?

240
00:17:30,887 --> 00:17:32,663
that Raman Menon, who
was an employee in the

241
00:17:32,688 --> 00:17:34,937
secretariat,what bullshit does
he know about tea garden?

242
00:17:35,227 --> 00:17:37,368
uncle is considering us all as enemies.

243
00:17:37,831 --> 00:17:40,379
is there any need for my
son to toil in Bombay?

244
00:17:40,841 --> 00:17:43,403
so uncle must please recommend
to His Highness, that

245
00:17:43,428 --> 00:17:45,990
give us anything if he plans
to as early as possible

246
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,092
how will l say?

247
00:17:48,411 --> 00:17:49,701
why don't you say?

248
00:17:49,826 --> 00:17:51,137
you are in the position of his dad no?

249
00:17:51,447 --> 00:17:52,885
no, not that

250
00:17:53,555 --> 00:17:57,653
l was planning to ask some
4-5 acres of land for

251
00:17:57,678 --> 00:18:02,362
Balaraman as bequeathal, how
can l ask this in between.

252
00:18:03,118 --> 00:18:04,189
oh l see,

253
00:18:04,423 --> 00:18:06,746
so there's some intention in coming here
with grandson

254
00:18:06,884 --> 00:18:11,067
we are all asking for what is due
how come grandpa deserve bequeathal?

255
00:18:11,538 --> 00:18:15,001
in fact none of us has any right

256
00:18:15,269 --> 00:18:18,051
everybody's share has been given

257
00:18:18,763 --> 00:18:25,285
Udaya Varma earned all these properties by
hard work, so if you are going to ask for

258
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:31,754
one's due. nobody will get anything l will
see that nobody gets even a bit of soil.

259
00:18:31,832 --> 00:18:33,552
grown so old, and still
no death for crookedness.

260
00:18:33,783 --> 00:18:38,904
Ravi, what's this? lnsulting elders? uncle,
please pardon; he is talking nonsense.

261
00:18:38,954 --> 00:18:44,010
no, he is talking with sense not good,
yourtongue will cost you your life

262
00:18:48,395 --> 00:18:49,693
somebody has come

263
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,961
there was 4-5 days respite
for this disturbance.

264
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:52,890
who's that?

265
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,802

00:26:15,228 --> 00:26:16,863
He came from Bombay by
flight, immediately

00:26:16,888 --> 00:26:18,637
after he got information,
about your illness.

343
00:26:18,863 --> 00:26:20,980

346
00:26:26,164 --> 00:26:27,722
Why? You thought l am dead?

347
00:26:27,849 --> 00:26:28,518
uncle!

348
00:26:28,883 --> 00:26:31,791
don't say such hard
words; l can't bear it

349
00:26:32,171 --> 00:26:35,110
l was just kidding man. Ha ha ha.

350
00:26:36,532 --> 00:26:38,298
why Namboodiri lagged behind?

351
00:26:38,644 --> 00:26:40,468
l always stays in back row

352
00:26:41,459 --> 00:26:43,781
our plan is to admit
Guptan in Kalamandalam

353
00:26:43,881 --> 00:26:45,481
before that we want
to know your opinion

354
00:26:45,915 --> 00:26:48,657
at least l should follow
uncle's line isn't it?

355
00:26:48,845 --> 00:26:53,019
all the other nephews are useless
guys, without any sense of art. so,

356
00:26:53,409 --> 00:26:54,132
l am happy

357
00:26:54,484 --> 00:26:58,158
l was worried if this art
and literature will perish,

358
00:26:58,183 --> 00:27:01,244
anyway its good that
such a man has emerged.

359
00:27:03,477 --> 00:27:06,723
did uncle really mean it,
or was it a dig at me?

360
00:27:06,946 --> 00:27:08,169
He really mean it.

361
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:15,442
Menon, why you wanted to see me
urgently?

362
00:27:15,655 --> 00:27:16,639
there is news

363
00:27:17,585 --> 00:27:20,336
l came across one thing while
searching a file in the shelf

364
00:27:20,524 --> 00:27:21,959
what? ls it any gem?

365
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:23,339
yes, something like that

366
00:27:23,766 --> 00:27:25,941
certain documents of property agreements

367
00:27:26,109 --> 00:27:27,987
so all the hearsay is true

368
00:27:28,228 --> 00:27:29,847
what is our share?

369
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,549
couldn't read in detail

370
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,557
that accountant Menon was with me

371
00:27:34,065 --> 00:27:36,308
still l did a rough scan within the limited
time

372
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:39,649
the palace and agricultural lands
are, allocated in the names

373
00:27:39,674 --> 00:27:42,442
of Princess Janaki, Princess
Subhadra, and Princess Mathu.

374
00:27:42,873 --> 00:27:45,321
Dad, we must somehow manage to,
include the Nilgiri estate to

375
00:27:45,346 --> 00:27:47,832
our part, for that can't we
exchange other agricultural lands?

376
00:27:48,098 --> 00:27:50,216
No, there is a separate
document for estate

377
00:27:50,686 --> 00:27:53,605
that is in the name of Radhika
and Her Highness Bhagirathi

378
00:27:53,894 --> 00:27:57,446
the vacant palace in Nilambur is also in
their names

379
00:27:57,933 --> 00:28:01,029
all these will turn out to be Radhika's
asset after the death of Her Highness

380
00:28:01,306 --> 00:28:02,361
to that low-cast girl?

381
00:28:02,739 --> 00:28:04,771
how can that girl, born
as a bastard to sweeper

382
00:28:04,796 --> 00:28:06,743
Nair woman, have right
over royal properties?

383
00:28:06,903 --> 00:28:07,676
that l don't know

384
00:28:07,807 --> 00:28:09,572
what a contemptible act has this uncle did!

385
00:28:09,786 --> 00:28:11,523
ask such things to His Highness directly

386
00:28:11,654 --> 00:28:12,908
l will ask, that's another thing

387
00:28:13,171 --> 00:28:16,678
deserving nephews other than me
also here.l will make them join me.

388
00:28:16,849 --> 00:28:19,942
look Pillai, l am doing such
favors, considering our maternal

389
00:28:19,967 --> 00:28:22,709
relation. this is my bread and butter.
Don't spoil it.

390
00:28:22,716 --> 00:28:24,771
you don't worry. l will take care of you.

391
00:28:25,148 --> 00:28:27,405
my concern is in losing the estate

392
00:28:28,016 --> 00:28:30,225
you won't lose it

393
00:28:30,789 --> 00:28:32,955
l have calculated some plans for it

394
00:28:33,642 --> 00:28:37,179
in a sense it is good that the estate
is written in the name of Radha

395
00:28:37,593 --> 00:28:39,354
so it will not have to
be divided into three.

396
00:28:41,364 --> 00:28:42,738
l didn't understand anything

397
00:28:43,165 --> 00:28:45,033
you won't understand anything

398
00:28:45,369 --> 00:28:48,418
Once Radha becomes a member
of our family, the estate

399
00:28:48,443 --> 00:28:51,434
will automatically become
part of ourfamily property

400
00:28:52,403 --> 00:28:55,828
My Goddess, What a brain

401
00:28:55,915 --> 00:28:59,167
lt's not my idea, this
is the brain behind it

402
00:29:06,909 --> 00:29:10,378
l am not getting a chance to talk to you in
privacy.

403
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:12,085
Where are you hiding?

404
00:29:12,822 --> 00:29:15,196
Any custom that you cannot come in front
of human beings?

405
00:29:15,509 --> 00:29:16,045
no.

406
00:29:18,386 --> 00:29:18,978
please stay there.

407
00:29:20,639 --> 00:29:23,580
l was thinking of telling certain things.

408
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,991
Wont your mind become stunted?
by staying here continuously?

409
00:29:29,555 --> 00:29:30,813
We all have only one life.

410
00:29:31,838 --> 00:29:35,448
all these worldly pleasures must be
experienced in our life time.

411
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:36,744
don't you want?

412
00:29:37,201 --> 00:29:38,743
l am comfortable here.

413
00:29:39,296 --> 00:29:40,128
what comfort?

414
00:29:41,021 --> 00:29:43,338
cooking and serving to the King
and the Queen thrice daily?

415
00:29:44,714 --> 00:29:47,636
l will take you to Bombay one day.

416
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:50,228
dad is calling.

417
00:29:50,827 --> 00:29:51,549
don't go.

418
00:29:53,232 --> 00:29:57,374
Radha, do you think you can manage
the estate in Nilagiri alone?

419
00:29:57,753 --> 00:29:58,327
estate?

420
00:29:58,351 --> 00:29:58,952
yes.

421
00:29:59,472 --> 00:30:00,935
why should l manage it all?

422
00:30:01,413 --> 00:30:03,702
then who else will look after the
estate in the name of Radha?

423
00:30:05,392 --> 00:30:09,600
l am even ready to settle down in Nilagiri
after constructing a bungalow there.

424
00:30:10,498 --> 00:30:12,118
the climate is very nice there.

425
00:30:12,534 --> 00:30:14,634
Oh, God! l don't understand anything.

426
00:30:15,636 --> 00:30:18,231
Oh, l see! You might have followed her.

427
00:30:18,293 --> 00:30:18,813
yes.

428
00:30:19,138 --> 00:30:22,892
l will tell aunt,
that you are indulging in dirty things.

429
00:30:22,912 --> 00:30:27,337
l don't mind. you better not
indulge in dirty things.

430
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,639
how dare you advise me?

431
00:30:30,851 --> 00:30:31,461
you may go.

432
00:30:36,312 --> 00:30:40,718
there is a rumor, that there is some
settlements, regarding properties.

433
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:47,243
l would like to know the truth.

434
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:48,600
whatever you heard is right.

435
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,896
the will is registered.

436
00:30:51,372 --> 00:30:55,752
all the assets except the estate, are
in the name of 3 sisters and others.

437
00:30:56,277 --> 00:30:59,524
estate is in the name of Radhika,
Her Highness, and Malathi.

438
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:06,953
and some unaccounted gold and money.
that will be divided equally.

439
00:31:09,216 --> 00:31:11,379
but you will get only
after the King's death.

440
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:14,958
you are getting the alimony regularly.

441
00:31:16,303 --> 00:31:19,195
so we will get it only after his death.

442
00:31:19,624 --> 00:31:20,131
Know?

443
00:31:22,499 --> 00:31:24,818
the astrological calculation
shows that, there

444
00:31:24,843 --> 00:31:27,112
is a chance for him, to
die at the age of 84.

445
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:32,625
after that even the lord of death,
cannot touch him until the age of 96.

446
00:31:33,026 --> 00:31:36,025
so we better take 96.

447
00:31:36,258 --> 00:31:38,733
so we will have to wait for 1 0-36 years.

448
00:31:39,594 --> 00:31:41,880
by that time all of us will be dead.

449
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:45,026
we are all going to live, at the
most for another 1 0 years.

450
00:31:45,231 --> 00:31:46,796
now itself there are signs of weakness.

451
00:31:47,068 --> 00:31:48,969
Guptan, no use in staying awake.
Go to sleep.

452
00:31:49,516 --> 00:31:51,561
don't desire the King's property.

453
00:31:51,684 --> 00:31:53,281
dad, please sit. Don't go.

454
00:31:53,684 --> 00:31:55,978
we shall meet uncle and present our case.

455
00:31:56,321 --> 00:31:59,029
ask for immediate disbursal of the due.

456
00:31:59,391 --> 00:32:01,677
yes. You ask for share, and
he will give it instantly.

457
00:32:01,849 --> 00:32:04,484
what a fool you are, my Guptan!

458
00:32:04,847 --> 00:32:06,800
don't you know uncle after all these years?

459
00:32:07,006 --> 00:32:09,116
that old man is a ghost,
who guards his treasure.

460
00:32:09,707 --> 00:32:11,445
think about anything practical.

461
00:32:11,734 --> 00:32:12,679
why not file a case?

462
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:15,573
we have to prove that old
man is insane like his

463
00:32:15,598 --> 00:32:17,856
wife, then the written
will become invalid.

464
00:32:18,265 --> 00:32:21,786
dad, if we proceed with the case,
we will lose whtever is due to us.

465
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,638
don't think of foolish plans.

466
00:32:23,895 --> 00:32:25,230
then what will we do?

467
00:32:25,698 --> 00:32:29,354
no, nothing doing. live comfortably with
regular food, and sleep. That's all.

468
00:32:31,695 --> 00:32:39,034
if you give one share to me, and
Balaraman, l will tell you an idea.

469
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:40,327
will you give me?

470
00:32:42,124 --> 00:32:42,693
will give, definitely.

471
00:32:42,953 --> 00:32:43,796
will give, definitely.

472
00:32:46,234 --> 00:32:51,275
war is the duty of a warrior.
we must fight a war. there's

473
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:56,597
nothing wrong in killing someone
during a war. its an honour.

474
00:32:57,511 --> 00:32:59,910
what? kiling? that
too your own uncle?

475
00:33:01,972 --> 00:33:06,687
haven't you heard of the story of,
Krishnan annihilating his uncle Kamsan?

476
00:33:07,732 --> 00:33:11,639
haven't you heard of
Arjunan shooting the holy

477
00:33:11,664 --> 00:33:15,237
arrow on, the chest of
his brother Karnan?

478
00:33:16,387 --> 00:33:18,675
that was not unrighteousness.

479
00:33:19,408 --> 00:33:26,479
there is no discretion at war whether
it is your father, son, uncle or nephew

480
00:33:26,812 --> 00:33:30,394
there is only your enemy.
the enemy.

481
00:33:51,231 --> 00:33:52,149
what's that?

482
00:33:52,977 --> 00:33:53,921
why at this odd-hour?

483
00:33:56,654 --> 00:33:57,974
you look really horrified.

484
00:33:58,574 --> 00:34:00,238
what happened? Tell me.

485
00:34:01,362 --> 00:34:03,659
l saw a dream.

486
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,162
Oh, that's all?

487
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:15,438
dad, you should be careful.

488
00:34:16,446 --> 00:34:18,244
there are enemies around you.

489
00:34:18,908 --> 00:34:19,525
shame

490
00:34:20,195 --> 00:34:24,545
what's this? Why worrying like
this, just after seeing a dream

491
00:34:25,428 --> 00:34:27,408
Nothing will happen.

492
00:34:28,237 --> 00:34:31,686
l know that all the faces,
laughing around are insincere.

493
00:34:32,307 --> 00:34:34,269
all are interested in property.

494
00:34:35,419 --> 00:34:37,588
not because l don't like to give.
am l going to

495
00:34:37,613 --> 00:34:39,690
take all these properties
along with my life?

496
00:34:40,891 --> 00:34:41,891
but when seeing their greed

497
00:34:47,561 --> 00:34:53,047
once you are married to a responsible
person, l don't worry in dying.

498
00:34:56,063 --> 00:34:57,723
go and sleep.

499
00:35:03,061 --> 00:35:04,418
who did the last move?

500
00:35:07,848 --> 00:35:10,786
if you don't feel sleepy,
l shall sit with you

501
00:35:11,272 --> 00:35:12,198
No.

502
00:35:12,647 --> 00:35:14,633
then go and sleep. this is my routine.

503
00:35:29,244 --> 00:35:32,131
you said you have 2 month's leave,
and why leaving so suddenly?

504
00:35:32,573 --> 00:35:34,699
l have an urgent matter.
Will return after 3-4 days.

505
00:35:35,071 --> 00:35:37,252
but why don't you tell a word to uncle?

506
00:35:37,356 --> 00:35:38,744
don't waste time for that. Come.

507
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:40,720
if he asks about me, you may tell him.

508
00:35:40,733 --> 00:35:43,069
oh, he has no time to care about you.
Leave fast without wasting time.

509
00:35:43,958 --> 00:35:47,252
no. you need not come.
3 people starting together is a bad omen.

510
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:52,231
Ravi has come.

511
00:35:53,468 --> 00:35:55,831
Praise the lord!

512
00:35:56,496 --> 00:35:58,763
do you remember what l said?

513
00:35:58,988 --> 00:35:59,415
Yes,

514
00:35:59,887 --> 00:36:03,321
don't think that Udayavarma,
is just an old man.

515
00:36:04,132 --> 00:36:07,430
though he don't have the power,
and glamour, he still is a king.

516
00:36:08,013 --> 00:36:09,164
he has that position.

517
00:36:09,716 --> 00:36:13,465
not only that, he is honored
in government level.

518
00:36:14,258 --> 00:36:18,555
A small mistake,
and you are all will be in jail.

519
00:36:19,316 --> 00:36:21,443
this poor blind man will be spared.

520
00:36:23,476 --> 00:36:26,575
His death should be executed,
in such a way that it

521
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,056
should be, either related to
senility, or by an accident.

522
00:36:30,665 --> 00:36:34,117
not even a trace of murder,
should be left behind.

523
00:36:34,398 --> 00:36:35,293
will it be possible?

524
00:36:35,368 --> 00:36:36,152
it must be possible.

525
00:36:37,152 --> 00:36:40,038
anyone can kill anybody.

526
00:36:40,373 --> 00:36:41,103
Even you can do that.

527
00:36:41,542 --> 00:36:43,686
the one who is assigned for the task...

528
00:36:44,384 --> 00:36:46,557
must be a professional. he
must be wise and skilled.

529
00:36:47,157 --> 00:36:51,439
no one should doubt him.
by his personality and behavior

530
00:36:52,242 --> 00:36:55,329
Forget this plan.
if you don't get such an ideal candidate.

531
00:36:55,739 --> 00:36:57,219
lt wont be difficult in Bombay.

532
00:36:57,443 --> 00:37:00,194
Bombay is the land of underworld kings.
Do you know that, grandpa?

533
00:37:00,797 --> 00:37:02,328
what do this blind man know?

534
00:37:02,675 --> 00:37:06,833
l am reminding you one thing again.
Unity is strength.

535
00:37:07,412 --> 00:37:09,955
it's better for all of
us if we stay together.

536
00:37:10,352 --> 00:37:13,839
don't reveal anything to the women at all.

537
00:37:14,048 --> 00:37:17,377
l won't tell Madhavi even if my head is
gone.

538
00:37:19,178 --> 00:37:20,327
so, shall l go, grandpa?

539
00:37:22,138 --> 00:37:23,242
wish you all the best

540
00:37:23,696 --> 00:37:24,785
wish you all the best

541
00:38:22,326 --> 00:38:23,107
lt's good

542
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:32,832
l don't want

543
00:38:33,814 --> 00:38:34,918
lt's good

544
00:38:34,975 --> 00:38:35,421
don't want

545
00:38:36,597 --> 00:38:37,555
lt's made in Japan

546
00:38:37,866 --> 00:38:38,631
how much?

547
00:38:38,998 --> 00:38:40,774
400, 500 and 600

548
00:38:40,881 --> 00:38:41,848
very costly!

549
00:38:42,206 --> 00:38:44,853
hey, please come man.

550
00:38:46,354 --> 00:38:49,469
What a bad omen l had today!

551
00:38:54,147 --> 00:38:54,850
Highness?

552
00:38:57,814 --> 00:38:58,558
Highness,

553
00:38:59,833 --> 00:39:03,317
where were you? you want anything?
New Japanese items are here.

554
00:39:03,645 --> 00:39:04,441
nothing now.

555
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:06,504
l have come in search of another man.

556
00:39:07,152 --> 00:39:09,474
Mamachan? You like duplicates?

557
00:39:09,786 --> 00:39:10,344
not that

558
00:39:10,708 --> 00:39:12,789
l want to see that Kabeer dada.

559
00:39:12,884 --> 00:39:13,874
An urgent matter

560
00:39:13,961 --> 00:39:17,698
Kabeer dada. you didn't know the news?
what? he's jailed

561
00:39:18,463 --> 00:39:19,300
is it?

562
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:23,248
the whole gang is in jail for murdering a
Marwadi

563
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:29,460
why decent royal people
are in dada's company?

564
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,600
that's, for another reason

565
00:39:31,864 --> 00:39:35,110
say openly, what ever be
you need l will arrange.

566
00:39:35,437 --> 00:39:37,904
you insist on Kabeer?

567
00:39:38,489 --> 00:39:39,409
No not like that

568
00:39:39,427 --> 00:39:42,495
Say clearly
You will get enough goondaas in Bombay.

569
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:44,946
tell me

570
00:39:55,026 --> 00:39:59,497
isn't this a matter you yourself
can handle? ls it necessary

571
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:03,698
to hire a goonda, from Bombay
to kill a 60-year old man?

572
00:40:05,105 --> 00:40:07,364
Things are not as simple as you think

573
00:40:07,651 --> 00:40:08,784
Uncle is a King,

574
00:40:09,389 --> 00:40:11,319
having high status in society

575
00:40:12,642 --> 00:40:16,353
everybody will be arrested,
if anybody sense doubt in our moves

576
00:40:16,641 --> 00:40:20,319
So the plan should be executed very
carefully

577
00:40:21,238 --> 00:40:23,763
in short,
u mean it should be a silent death,

578
00:40:23,973 --> 00:40:24,478
is it?

579
00:40:24,991 --> 00:40:26,453
OK, let's see

580
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:33,120
Choudhary Saahib, are you fine?

581
00:40:33,422 --> 00:40:33,868
fine

582
00:40:36,374 --> 00:40:37,004
Look him

583
00:40:38,426 --> 00:40:38,942
waiter

584
00:40:43,382 --> 00:40:45,418
give us some water
first, sure sir

585
00:40:47,944 --> 00:40:50,367
that man is suitable-Choudhary Saahib.

586
00:40:50,917 --> 00:40:51,827
How is he?

587
00:40:52,189 --> 00:40:56,115
Or else, the man sitting next to him,
Sunder Singh. Both are good.

588
00:40:58,064 --> 00:40:58,594
How is he?

589
00:40:58,888 --> 00:41:01,322
if you want, the deal can be finalized
and the advance paid now itself.

590
00:41:14,904 --> 00:41:18,167
No, no. l don't want him.
he is having an outlook of a goonda

591
00:41:18,602 --> 00:41:21,151
do you think goondas
will have Prem Nazir's

592
00:41:21,176 --> 00:41:24,072
looks? Coudhary has the
better looks, than others

593
00:41:24,452 --> 00:41:28,891
but to stay in the palace, one
requires a decent personality.

594
00:41:29,568 --> 00:41:34,128
if you insist on the perfect
person, l will have to come

595
00:41:36,329 --> 00:41:37,403
Oh, what a charm,

596
00:41:38,631 --> 00:41:40,733
Stop joking. Tell me if
you can arrange or not.

597
00:41:41,356 --> 00:41:42,993
Or else l have to look
for other alternatives.

598
00:41:44,245 --> 00:41:46,048
so you didn't like none of these guys?

599
00:41:47,875 --> 00:41:51,546
there's a man.
But we must convince him.

600
00:41:52,278 --> 00:41:52,926
who is it?

601
00:41:53,418 --> 00:41:54,460
a demon.

602
00:41:55,447 --> 00:41:58,450
But if we get him
convinced, done.

603
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:01,197
He will kill the man smoothly

604
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:09,116
it's not like butchering chicken and goats
He knows how to do it systematically

605
00:42:10,162 --> 00:42:13,180
and he is not the type
of killing directly.

606
00:42:13,205 --> 00:42:16,702
will kill only if all the
conditions are suitable.

607
00:42:18,421 --> 00:42:19,349
how does he look?

608
00:42:19,628 --> 00:42:21,074
He looks exactly like you.

609
00:42:21,446 --> 00:42:21,985
Oh!

610
00:42:22,497 --> 00:42:25,260
Yes, and he is well built.

611
00:42:25,747 --> 00:42:29,114
His color is golden, not black like you.

612
00:42:29,982 --> 00:42:33,768
His face is round, not like your's

613
00:42:35,008 --> 00:42:36,032
then why did you say he looks like me?

614
00:42:36,332 --> 00:42:39,373
l was just giving a rough idea.

615
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,614
now where is he?

How can i kill a human atleast

My god, l can't
even think of it.

666
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,490
haven't you told me that you
want to, regain your ancestral

667
00:46:54,515 --> 00:46:56,914
home after making, some money
by finishing off someone?

668
00:46:57,267 --> 00:46:59,370
that was just my wish dear Jamaal.

669
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:00,265
Just a wish?

670
00:47:00,531 --> 00:47:02,287
See, a word should be a word.

671
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:05,702
Do you know that most
of the millionaires, in

672
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:08,962
Bombay have amassed money,
by killing and stealing!

673
00:47:09,347 --> 00:47:13,403
l'm still doing this meager business,
because l don't have the guts to do so.

674
00:47:13,758 --> 00:47:17,527
Believe, it's the God who gave this chance.

675
00:47:17,927 --> 00:47:19,489
and not because there are no goondaas...
in Bombay.

676
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,348
we don't have the right,
to annihilate God's creations.

677
00:47:22,685 --> 00:47:26,268
if so, do we have the right, to relinquish
the 2 lakh rupees, that God gives to us?

678
00:47:26,604 --> 00:47:29,556
Abdulla, lf you are saying philosophy,
l too have certain things to say.

679
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:32,397
The Koran says: Your name is written...
on every single

680
00:47:32,422 --> 00:47:34,924
grain that you eat. Do you
know what is meant by that?

681
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:37,516
you are destined to get this 2 lakh rupees.

682
00:47:38,092 --> 00:47:41,890
if you give a share of it to me,
l also will get the benefit.

683
00:47:42,087 --> 00:47:43,105
Please agree this deal.

684
00:47:47,588 --> 00:47:50,435
anyway, don't reject this offer.

685
00:47:54,733 --> 00:47:56,656
l will tell you the rest. Come.

686
00:47:57,292 --> 00:47:58,884
Don't worry, come.

687
00:48:01,226 --> 00:48:02,006
please come.

688
00:48:04,076 --> 00:48:07,268
Highness, you are really a lucky man.

689
00:48:07,842 --> 00:48:11,335
How ever i made him agree

690
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:17,396
now it's your turn to explain to him...
the details of your plans.

691
00:48:17,827 --> 00:48:20,549
l also will reach there,
at then right moment, if needed.

692
00:48:20,682 --> 00:48:21,477

693
00:49:09,318 --> 00:49:11,073
adjust your cloth properly

694
00:49:19,993 --> 00:49:20,606
Unni

695
00:49:22,728 --> 00:49:24,148
Wows,

696
00:49:26,394 --> 00:49:27,081
isn't it Unni?

697
00:49:27,386 --> 00:49:27,991
no

698
00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:29,042
then who?

699
00:49:29,272 --> 00:49:30,038
Don't know

700
00:49:31,341 --> 00:49:34,584
Yes, its Unni,
Unni

701
00:49:36,647 --> 00:49:37,971

00:50:07,339 --> 00:50:09,057

she is not normal and she's
behaving, not knowing who are you

751
00:51:39,264 --> 00:51:40,112
what are you upto?

752
00:51:40,433 --> 00:51:42,175

757
00:52:04,864 --> 00:52:06,225
this entrance was grand!

758
00:52:07,283 --> 00:52:11,553
lt was like the story of Urvasi's
curse, turning good to Arjunan.

759
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:16,999
it is a bless in disguise if not
could he manage to get in the harm?

760
00:52:18,195 --> 00:52:22,296
luck is on our side,
what is his name?

761
00:52:22,756 --> 00:52:24,609
Ananthan Namboodiri, plakkurissi illam

762
00:52:25,782 --> 00:52:28,466
does he know how to
behave, like a Brahmin?

763
00:52:28,577 --> 00:52:31,387
yes, he knows a little bit
of Sanskrit, and literature

764
00:52:31,428 --> 00:52:33,195
he has some taste in music too

765
00:52:33,493 --> 00:52:36,834
he has an Eranadan accent.

766
00:52:37,644 --> 00:52:39,953
keep an eye on him always

767
00:52:40,713 --> 00:52:42,102
we should not be fools

768
00:52:42,263 --> 00:52:43,062
you understand

769
00:52:43,302 --> 00:52:43,918
yes

770
00:53:01,056 --> 00:53:01,656
Princess

771
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:06,135
think she is asleep

772
00:53:07,041 --> 00:53:08,894
any problem if l take my hand?

773
00:53:09,079 --> 00:53:11,268
no, the medicine is strong

774
00:53:12,603 --> 00:53:15,135
she will get up only after at least 4 hours

775
00:53:21,564 --> 00:53:22,217
princess

776
00:53:22,398 --> 00:53:23,670
how can l get out of here?

777
00:53:24,317 --> 00:53:25,126
hey, what did you call me?

778
00:53:25,774 --> 00:53:26,599
Princess?

779
00:53:27,156 --> 00:53:29,170
then what should l call?

780
00:53:30,386 --> 00:53:36,457
l am seeing a palace a king, a queen,
and a princess for the first time.

781
00:53:37,183 --> 00:53:40,407
so l don't have an idea how to behave.

782
00:53:40,931 --> 00:53:44,079
see l am not a princess

783
00:53:45,284 --> 00:53:47,071
then who are you?

784
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:51,310
me, me,

785
00:53:52,342 --> 00:53:56,292
l am a woman living in everybody's mercy

786
00:53:56,568 --> 00:53:57,230
oh, l see

787
00:53:59,888 --> 00:54:01,258
so what should l call you now?

788
00:54:03,092 --> 00:54:03,700
Radha

789
00:54:04,221 --> 00:54:06,126
hi, Radha?

790
00:54:06,835 --> 00:54:11,479
ha.ha.ha, it's Fine. so
where are lady companions?

791
00:54:17,142 --> 00:54:19,532
you didn't tell me the way out.

792
00:54:19,852 --> 00:54:21,911
go this way,
and you'll find a ladder

793
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:27,614
get down to a corridor that
lands to a small dining hall

794
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:29,554
turn left;

795
00:54:29,902 --> 00:54:31,611
there you'll see the
verandah, of the Bungalow.

796
00:54:32,318 --> 00:54:33,490
on the right side is a well

797
00:54:33,973 --> 00:54:38,657
l'll tell you the way. asking for the
way, inside the queen's bedroom?

798
00:54:40,761 --> 00:54:42,357
you seem to be a jovial type.

799
00:54:42,644 --> 00:54:43,850
nothing of the sort.

800
00:54:44,177 --> 00:54:45,763
still there is a little bit.

801
00:54:46,095 --> 00:54:47,582
if so you better stop it

802
00:54:48,468 --> 00:54:49,649
you have been ordered to see him.

803
00:54:49,872 --> 00:54:50,369
whom?

804
00:54:50,639 --> 00:54:53,752
who else to order here,
other than His Highness?

805
00:54:53,906 --> 00:54:55,612
the real King Udayavarma.

806
00:54:55,846 --> 00:54:59,552
don't you know,
that l don't like strangers?

807
00:55:00,058 --> 00:55:01,672
Reverence to uncle,

808
00:55:02,061 --> 00:55:07,331
and the zest to become closer to you.
that's why l brought him here

809
00:55:08,397 --> 00:55:09,966
Ok, it is not because of that.

810
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:16,626
still, isn't it improper to allow,
strangers to live inside this home?

811
00:55:17,183 --> 00:55:21,960
but look, Uncle, you are an
admirer of arts, he is an

812
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:27,292
artist. so there is propriety
of artistic meeting? besides,

813
00:55:27,478 --> 00:55:32,659
he is interested in various
subjects, such as the architectural

814
00:55:32,684 --> 00:55:37,055
aspects and the historical
background, of our palace.

815
00:55:37,291 --> 00:55:39,755
for that where else can he go?

816
00:55:44,567 --> 00:55:47,398
what is your relation
with Plakkurissi illam?

817
00:55:48,175 --> 00:55:50,130
at Plakkurissi illam

818
00:55:52,058 --> 00:55:56,642
my name is Ananthan Namboodiri, Nambhoodiri

819
00:55:56,710 --> 00:55:57,502
not that

820
00:55:57,811 --> 00:55:59,779
l asked, how you are related to,
Krishnan Namboodiri.

821
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:05,114
Vamadevan Namboodiri has
married,Krishnan Namboodiri's daughter.

822
00:56:05,936 --> 00:56:08,324
And he is related to this man,

823
00:56:10,486 --> 00:56:11,641
How are you grandpa?

824
00:56:13,655 --> 00:56:15,792
grandpa, grandpa,

825
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:17,011
he is no more.

826
00:56:17,081 --> 00:56:19,304
died? don't say bull shit.

827
00:56:19,756 --> 00:56:21,677
l had seen him at Guruvayoor last month.

828
00:56:21,892 --> 00:56:27,581
No. he is not dead. The one
who died was another uncle.

829
00:56:29,363 --> 00:56:31,756
Krishnsn Namboodiri's music
concert, is fantastic.

830
00:56:31,908 --> 00:56:33,276
l had attended a few of them.

831
00:56:33,942 --> 00:56:35,900
ok, is the partition at your family over?

832
00:56:36,164 --> 00:56:37,836
partition

833
00:56:38,619 --> 00:56:42,169
so shall l arrange for his
stay, at that vacant building?

834
00:56:42,643 --> 00:56:43,841
for staying?

835
00:56:45,512 --> 00:56:46,412
what do you say Menon?

836
00:56:47,083 --> 00:56:49,241
Let him go after staying here
for one or two days.

837
00:56:49,771 --> 00:56:50,519
as you wish.

838
00:56:50,944 --> 00:56:52,920
are you hygienic kind of a person?

839
00:56:53,014 --> 00:56:54,827
extremely hygienic.

840
00:56:55,649 --> 00:56:58,122
the youngsters need not be so.

841
00:57:27,367 --> 00:57:28,765
why are you staring at me like this?

842
00:57:29,105 --> 00:57:29,902
no, nothing.

843
00:57:30,222 --> 00:57:32,798
lt is midnight. l came to see what
you are doing, staying awake.

844
00:57:33,877 --> 00:57:36,415
nothing, l couldn't sleep.

845
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:39,080
you seem to be restless.

846
00:57:39,696 --> 00:57:40,177
me?

847
00:57:40,703 --> 00:57:42,252
no, nothing of the sort.

848
00:57:42,732 --> 00:57:44,168
then switch off the light and go to sleep.

849
00:58:27,529 --> 00:58:28,123
Hands up

850
00:58:31,201 --> 00:58:31,729
was it you?

851
00:58:32,691 --> 00:58:35,936
all of you would have been died now.

852
00:58:36,882 --> 00:58:40,044
be careful while handling this.

853
00:58:40,336 --> 00:58:41,481
lt's dangerous.

854
00:58:44,272 --> 00:58:48,373
Does that Raman Menon have any doubt?

855
00:58:48,732 --> 00:58:49,737
l didn't feel so.

856
00:58:50,003 --> 00:58:53,938
Beware of the dwarfs!
They are very cunning.

857
00:58:54,568 --> 00:58:56,699
don't leave us to risk.

858
00:58:57,891 --> 00:59:03,341
don't worry. On a good morning you will
know, that the king Udaya Varma is dead.

859
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:09,654
Remember, l must get the reward without
dues, the moment his burial starts.

860
00:59:11,038 --> 00:59:13,697
Or else all of you will be
in danger, as you said.

861
00:59:13,904 --> 00:59:16,437
No, we will not deceive you. You will be
paid, more than what you are offered.

862
00:59:16,627 --> 00:59:20,639
if so, you go to sleep.

863
00:59:21,486 --> 00:59:22,610
Let me plan things.

864
00:59:28,050 --> 00:59:29,049
come

865
00:59:49,276 --> 00:59:50,470
this is the routine.

866
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:55,047
l will reach only half the way,
when all the others finish.

867
00:59:56,048 --> 00:59:57,803
You too are eating well.

868
01:00:01,904 --> 01:00:03,392
have some more butter milk.

869
01:00:04,268 --> 01:00:05,673
give him some butter milk.

870
01:00:12,893 --> 01:00:15,097
did you like the curries?

871
01:00:16,285 --> 01:00:17,005
really fine;

872
01:00:17,801 --> 01:00:18,698
especially the curd curry.

873
01:00:19,481 --> 01:00:21,583
Why paayasam today?
Any special occasion?

874
01:00:21,773 --> 01:00:23,832
paayasam is a regular item in the menu.

875
01:00:24,088 --> 01:00:25,885
is it? So l'm lucky.

876
01:00:27,584 --> 01:00:32,290
Today's preparation was, under
Saudamini's supervision.

877
01:00:32,388 --> 01:00:33,289
who is Saudamini?

878
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:34,080
Me.

879
01:00:37,994 --> 01:00:38,782
really nice.

880
01:00:40,411 --> 01:00:43,300
Delicious like her.

881
01:00:46,995 --> 01:00:48,705
Saudamini is satisfied.

882
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:51,397
You are praised by a Namboodiri,
from a renowned family.

883
01:00:52,544 --> 01:00:54,310
what a charistmatic face,

884
01:00:54,616 --> 01:00:57,037
lt's full of elegance of a Brahmin.

885
01:00:57,490 --> 01:00:59,507
Ravi said he is a scholarly person.

886
01:01:00,103 --> 01:01:02,572
The only son of a renowned family.

887
01:01:04,039 --> 01:01:04,639
who?

888
01:01:05,007 --> 01:01:06,089
Ananthan Namboodiri.

889
01:01:06,616 --> 01:01:08,666
hmm he is famous.

890
01:01:09,036 --> 01:01:10,908
But not sure in which field.

891
01:01:11,241 --> 01:01:15,979
careful. Your calculations
may go wrong.

892
01:01:19,490 --> 01:01:21,880
its right that one namboodiri doesn't
like... another of the same caste.

893
01:01:23,322 --> 01:01:26,788
sister, if you think that they
are matching, why not proceed?

894
01:01:30,425 --> 01:01:31,389
did you call me, uncle?

895
01:01:32,196 --> 01:01:33,980
yes. called.

896
01:01:34,630 --> 01:01:36,917
Did your friend leave?

897
01:01:37,164 --> 01:01:38,243
no

898
01:01:38,244 --> 01:01:38,875
why?

899
01:01:40,304 --> 01:01:42,586
he doesn't feel like leaving.

900
01:01:42,855 --> 01:01:43,586
that's not right.

901
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:46,945
l don't like a grown
up man roaming, around

902
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:49,922
like this in a place.
where young women live.

903
01:01:50,144 --> 01:01:50,870
Tell him to leave.

904
01:01:51,127 --> 01:01:52,705
no, uncle. He is not a problem man.

905
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,388
He is very decent

906
01:01:54,624 --> 01:01:55,634
no more explanation

907
01:01:56,108 --> 01:02:00,254
l allowed him to stay here for two days.
Now what?

908
01:02:00,534 --> 01:02:01,655
nothing, he,

909
01:02:01,791 --> 01:02:04,193
Menon will tell him if
you find it difficult.

910
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:05,022
What say?

911
01:02:05,318 --> 01:02:06,811
just give me the permission,

912
01:02:06,975 --> 01:02:08,731
and l will throw him out.

913
01:02:09,109 --> 01:02:10,312
No, l will tell him.

914
01:02:17,327 --> 01:02:18,947
what's your plan man?

915
01:02:20,262 --> 01:02:25,289
l should be blamed for bringing,
a donkey like you here.

916
01:02:25,411 --> 01:02:27,707
look, don't say this to me.

917
01:02:28,036 --> 01:02:31,719
l acted like Ananthan
Nampoothiri, behaved

918
01:02:31,744 --> 01:02:35,939
decently, and did whatever,
me to do, What next?

919
01:02:36,026 --> 01:02:38,171
you should have gone closer to
him by realizing his weaknesses.

920
01:02:38,544 --> 01:02:40,975
but you wasted time, looking here
and there. you should have glued

921
01:02:41,051 --> 01:02:42,407
Am l fevicol to glue?

922
01:02:42,739 --> 01:02:43,843
Yes, you should have like Fevicol

923
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:44,457
l'll keep in mind.

924
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:49,183
it's too late. you better leave
before you are thrown out.

925
01:02:51,639 --> 01:02:57,061
Look, shall l try a small trick.

926
01:02:57,079 --> 01:02:57,910
what trick?

927
01:04:02,488 --> 01:04:07,076
The harem garden,

928
01:04:07,557 --> 01:04:12,110
is filled with the spring of music again.

929
01:04:13,972 --> 01:04:18,883
The harem garden

930
01:04:19,878 --> 01:04:23,938
is filled with the
spring of music again.

931
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:30,247
like an auspicious evening.

932
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:36,036
like an auspicious evening.

933
01:04:36,450 --> 01:04:41,834
when the bright light in the palm.
Shines over somber shadow.

934
01:04:42,434 --> 01:04:46,228
The harem garden

935
01:04:47,763 --> 01:04:52,484
is filled with the spring of music again.

936
01:05:36,778 --> 01:05:40,956
in a forgotten story,

937
01:05:42,838 --> 01:05:47,368
l became the warm teardrop,
in the Sarayu river.

938
01:05:48,618 --> 01:05:56,368
l became the warm teardrop,
in the Sarayu river.

939
01:06:00,091 --> 01:06:07,028
as the poet wear a new golden crown
when intoxicated by the nectar of music

940
01:06:07,988 --> 01:06:10,691
here today

941
01:06:11,028 --> 01:06:15,474
the harem garden

942
01:06:17,397 --> 01:06:22,065
is filled with the spring of music again.

943
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:59,504
in a forgotten story,

944
01:07:01,495 --> 01:07:05,429
l was flotting like wild
flower, in the river Yamuna.

945
01:07:06,967 --> 01:07:11,952
in a forgotten story,

946
01:07:12,824 --> 01:07:17,192
l was flotting like wild
flower, in the river Yamuna.

947
01:07:18,761 --> 01:07:22,246
When the flute that is
caressed by the sweet winds

948
01:07:22,271 --> 01:07:25,414
of Krishna, produces a
sound of merging ages.

949
01:07:26,523 --> 01:07:28,986
here today.

950
01:07:30,755 --> 01:07:34,338
the harem garden,

951
01:07:35,450 --> 01:07:40,618
is filled with the spring of music again.

952
01:07:42,296 --> 01:07:45,739
the harem garden,

953
01:07:47,566 --> 01:07:52,809
is filled with the spring of music again.

954
01:07:54,075 --> 01:07:58,814
like an auspicious evening.

955
01:07:59,739 --> 01:08:04,235
like an auspicious evening.

956
01:08:05,408 --> 01:08:11,132
when the bright light in the
palm, Shines over somber shadow

957
01:08:11,229 --> 01:08:15,075
the harem garden,

958
01:08:16,149 --> 01:08:21,292
is filled with the spring of music again.

959
01:08:32,406 --> 01:08:33,088
sorry

960
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:35,249
l'm ready to leave

961
01:08:36,915 --> 01:08:39,516
it was my wish to sing before you

962
01:08:41,314 --> 01:08:43,132
realized that l wouldn't get a chance

963
01:08:43,701 --> 01:08:46,554
so please excuse me

964
01:08:47,319 --> 01:08:48,201
who is your master?

965
01:08:48,986 --> 01:08:50,421
nobody to name.

966
01:08:51,286 --> 01:08:53,021
But in the deep of my heart, l
consider my father as the master.

967
01:08:53,688 --> 01:08:54,413
what's his name?

968
01:08:56,893 --> 01:08:57,583
tell me

969
01:08:58,523 --> 01:09:00,643
your style of singing,
reminds me of an old one

970
01:09:02,489 --> 01:09:05,441
Vamadevan Namboodiri of
Plakkurissi, illam, is my father.

971
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:08,435
lt was he who taught me the basics.

972
01:09:09,514 --> 01:09:12,237
l had the privilege for that, only
till the age of 5 when he died.

973
01:09:12,829 --> 01:09:14,894
wish you all the best.

974
01:09:15,437 --> 01:09:19,216
Clarity, purity and momentum,
are all blended well.

975
01:09:20,833 --> 01:09:23,374
take this

976
01:09:23,813 --> 01:09:24,836
a small gift

977
01:09:27,263 --> 01:09:29,042
l will leave tomorrow morning.

978
01:09:29,347 --> 01:09:29,987
wait,

979
01:09:30,770 --> 01:09:33,445
l never thought he is so smart.

980
01:09:34,007 --> 01:09:36,199
Your departure will be decided tomorrow.

981
01:09:36,259 --> 01:09:37,143
what say? as you wish

982
01:09:40,091 --> 01:09:41,057
How was the song?

983
01:09:41,243 --> 01:09:42,010
did you like the song?

984
01:09:43,101 --> 01:09:46,133
who ever sings, this girl
will find some fault in it.

985
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:48,493
Like no serenity of voice,
it was gimmicking etc etc.

986
01:09:49,004 --> 01:09:51,162
Tell if this one has any
minus points directly.

987
01:10:07,771 --> 01:10:09,136
How was that, man

988
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:12,464
Good job, Well done,

989
01:10:17,065 --> 01:10:20,783
now you are not only the
friend of him,mine too.

990
01:10:26,536 --> 01:10:30,090
what a wonder is that
Krishnan Namboodiri has not

991
01:10:30,115 --> 01:10:33,526
mentioned a single word,
about such a grandson.

992
01:10:34,803 --> 01:10:41,081
he didn't like my voice at all. He used
to say that, it was like an oiled voice.

993
01:10:41,637 --> 01:10:43,609
then should the voice be
like, beating on the rocks?

994
01:10:43,828 --> 01:10:45,817
Music should be melodious for hearing.

995
01:10:46,434 --> 01:10:48,917
there is a saying,
nobody values the jasmine in his garden.

996
01:10:49,366 --> 01:10:53,226
oh,
Do you have a sense of humor to say so?

997
01:10:53,898 --> 01:10:56,366
anyway some improvement is there

998
01:10:56,507 --> 01:10:58,239
even the stone will gain
beauty as a result of

999
01:10:58,264 --> 01:10:59,995
close contact with the
pollen grain of jasmine

1000
01:11:00,238 --> 01:11:01,899
not beauty, its fragrance.

1001
01:11:02,222 --> 01:11:03,113
this is right

1002
01:11:03,484 --> 01:11:04,823
don't you have nothing to say?

1003
01:11:05,121 --> 01:11:08,053
l don't have the guts to say,
such things in front of uncle

1004
01:11:08,377 --> 01:11:10,705
oh, the Malayalam language is saved,

1005
01:11:12,529 --> 01:11:15,774
look, don't you have to inform people,
at home that you will be late by few days?

1006
01:11:16,094 --> 01:11:16,992
no need of it.

1007
01:11:17,405 --> 01:11:20,544
After my studies, my
main hobby is traveling.

1008
01:11:21,039 --> 01:11:25,225
each round takes 2-3 months,
to return home.

1009
01:11:26,116 --> 01:11:27,570
then what about your marriage?

1010
01:11:27,917 --> 01:11:29,290
marriage,

1011
01:11:30,103 --> 01:11:31,518
not yet over.

1012
01:11:31,955 --> 01:11:33,303
what do you mean?

1013
01:11:34,514 --> 01:11:36,203
that means didn't get a chance.

1014
01:11:38,150 --> 01:11:40,130
ok, do you have any other
talent, other than music?

1015
01:11:40,379 --> 01:11:44,002
yes, he knows many things,
Sanskrit, literature, poetry

1016
01:11:44,194 --> 01:11:45,050
oh, you know poetry too?

1017
01:11:45,815 --> 01:11:46,891
if so, let me see.

1018
01:11:51,599 --> 01:11:54,540
musk bindi,

1019
01:11:55,084 --> 01:11:55,732
Unni,

1020
01:11:55,918 --> 01:11:57,049
where is my Unni?

1021
01:11:57,848 --> 01:11:59,348
Radha, call my Unni.

1022
01:12:01,447 --> 01:12:02,214
Unni,

1023
01:12:02,667 --> 01:12:03,666
Unni,

1024
01:12:05,694 --> 01:12:07,202
what is this mom?

1025
01:12:07,572 --> 01:12:09,994
she threw away everything and pushed me

1026
01:12:10,266 --> 01:12:12,672
for saying that man is not Unni.

1027
01:12:13,271 --> 01:12:15,231
didn't my Unni come Radha?

1028
01:12:15,496 --> 01:12:16,251
yes he came.

1029
01:12:16,398 --> 01:12:19,565
Saraswathi was telling lie.
l saw him just now.

1030
01:12:19,832 --> 01:12:22,176
then what did he say? Will he come now?
will come.

1031
01:12:22,282 --> 01:12:23,945
Mom, get up and sit on the coat.

1032
01:12:36,770 --> 01:12:38,287
Saraswati, bring milk

1033
01:12:45,297 --> 01:12:46,618
l have to tell you something

1034
01:12:48,003 --> 01:12:53,438
oh, who is this? Radha! how do
you manage to stay unnoticed?

1035
01:12:54,465 --> 01:12:55,492
This is a real talent

1036
01:12:57,081 --> 01:12:58,573
l have learned this in my childhood.

1037
01:12:59,078 --> 01:13:03,421
lf l happen to come across the Princesses,
they will scold me

1038
01:13:04,314 --> 01:13:12,109
l got names such as, low
caste girl, bad omen, etc

1039
01:13:13,348 --> 01:13:16,766
Addressed 'Radha' and 'mol' only recently

1040
01:13:17,281 --> 01:13:19,531
now can't you enjoy that privilege?

1041
01:13:20,451 --> 01:13:21,150
why should l?

1042
01:13:21,923 --> 01:13:27,922
l know that, they are
all showing hypocrisy.

1043
01:13:28,050 --> 01:13:31,357
hey, what's this?
Are you crying?

1044
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:33,855
l feel bad seeing girls crying,

1045
01:13:34,552 --> 01:13:35,324
especially Radha.

1046
01:13:36,324 --> 01:13:38,448
l like pleasant face always.

1047
01:13:40,669 --> 01:13:42,034
smile, let me see.

1048
01:13:44,229 --> 01:13:45,242
please, smile.

1049
01:13:47,214 --> 01:13:49,408
wow! How beautiful

1050
01:13:50,753 --> 01:13:53,321
come on, tell me.
What you wanted to say?

1051
01:13:54,385 --> 01:13:55,858
will you come near my mom?

1052
01:13:56,535 --> 01:13:57,585
will it be foolish?

1053
01:13:58,041 --> 01:14:00,649
she thought that you are Unni.

1054
01:14:01,665 --> 01:14:02,908
l, am fed up of saying lies.

1055
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:07,012
l soothe her by saying,
your son will come

1056
01:14:07,037 --> 01:14:10,132
tomorrow, day after
tomorrow &amp; things like that

1057
01:14:10,496 --> 01:14:12,180
poor mom.

1058
01:14:12,967 --> 01:14:14,835
How long can l give her hope?

1059
01:14:15,434 --> 01:14:17,141
Do you mind to coming?

1060
01:14:19,471 --> 01:14:20,286
l will come

1061
01:14:22,019 --> 01:14:23,629
how did this Unni dies?

1062
01:14:25,191 --> 01:14:28,848
he went for excursion from the school.
7 students

1063
01:14:28,873 --> 01:14:32,822
died when the bus overturned.
Unni was one among them

1064
01:14:33,898 --> 01:14:35,596
he was just 1 0 years old.

1065
01:14:36,665 --> 01:14:42,013
Couldn't bring the dead body.
Not much of the body was regained.

1066
01:14:43,715 --> 01:14:45,230
mom is not informed of his death.

1067
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:46,727
We said investigating, he
will come today tomorrow,

1068
01:14:46,752 --> 01:14:47,510
and many more excuses.She
is told that he is missing.

1069
01:14:48,161 --> 01:14:55,313
at last she became abnormal.

1070
01:14:56,886 --> 01:15:03,253
she was violent in the beginning.
but spared only me

1071
01:15:07,595 --> 01:15:08,509
your mom?

1072
01:15:08,969 --> 01:15:11,212
l don't remember the
woman, who delivered me.

1073
01:15:12,218 --> 01:15:15,359
she abandoned me when l was 1 year old.

1074
01:15:16,321 --> 01:15:20,494
from then onwards,
this abnormal woman is my mother.

1075
01:15:21,390 --> 01:15:25,727
Saraswathi will say, Her
Highness looked after

1076
01:15:25,752 --> 01:15:29,628
me, when l was child,
as normal women do.

1077
01:15:30,698 --> 01:15:32,428
my mom likes me so much.

1078
01:15:33,798 --> 01:15:34,457
father

1079
01:15:39,060 --> 01:15:41,608
why do you make my child cry?

1080
01:15:41,932 --> 01:15:44,701
no, nothing, l was
asking about Unni

1081
01:15:47,745 --> 01:15:51,064
why is that girl narrating
the story to all?

1082
01:15:52,418 --> 01:15:53,522
l was asking,

1083
01:15:55,525 --> 01:16:00,045
Menon,
l cannot go any where.

1084
01:16:00,655 --> 01:16:02,218
tell them, l am not well.

1085
01:16:06,887 --> 01:16:09,445
did l do anything wrong?

1086
01:16:09,445 --> 01:16:11,673
none of us did any wrong.
lt was destiny.

1087
01:16:12,723 --> 01:16:15,824
l had agreed to go to, the collector's
bungalow don't know what will happen

1088
01:16:18,979 --> 01:16:20,058
mom

1089
01:16:50,373 --> 01:16:51,117
Unni

1090
01:16:51,718 --> 01:16:52,635

1091
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:55,106

1092
01:16:59,631 --> 01:17:02,329

1093
01:17:08,588 --> 01:17:09,936
where were you?

1094
01:17:10,213 --> 01:17:11,410
Didn't you see Unni coming?

1095
01:17:12,982 --> 01:17:15,076
l won't allow Unni to leave me.

1096
01:17:15,952 --> 01:17:17,021
please don't leave me

1097
01:17:18,231 --> 01:17:18,832
will you go?

1098
01:17:19,011 --> 01:17:19,548
no

1099
01:17:20,445 --> 01:17:21,988
Unni has lots of works to do.

1100
01:17:22,416 --> 01:17:24,927
He will come and sit besides
you, when he will free.

1101
01:17:25,378 --> 01:17:25,810
right?

1102
01:17:25,872 --> 01:17:26,332
yes

1103
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:31,270
there are enemies all around us.

1104
01:17:31,784 --> 01:17:35,332
The news is that uncle will
command, the army from Mathilakam.

1105
01:17:36,075 --> 01:17:40,423
Spies are prowling in the palace.
Beware

1106
01:17:42,076 --> 01:17:43,654
shall l unlock this chain?

1107
01:17:44,742 --> 01:17:45,796
unlock it Radha.

1108
01:17:47,614 --> 01:17:48,708
do you fear, Unni?

1109
01:17:49,210 --> 01:17:50,598
why should he mom?

1110
01:17:54,892 --> 01:17:56,726

1111
01:17:57,728 --> 01:17:58,673

Please come. l'll show you a scene.

look at Her Highness, will she
look like an abnormal women?

1116
01:18:45,634 --> 01:18:47,819
locking her inside a room is foolishness,

1117
01:18:48,273 --> 01:18:49,114
Look how better she feels.

1118
01:19:25,337 --> 01:19:27,400
Ananthan Namboodiri have you, started
prostrating prayers in public?

1119
01:19:28,222 --> 01:19:32,208
l have to do it 5 times daily.
lt all turned irregular after l came here.

1120
01:19:32,603 --> 01:19:36,812
you can prostrate as you like in Bombay if
you finished the task, as early

1121
01:19:38,136 --> 01:19:41,403
by the way,
how did you plan the murder?

1122
01:19:41,673 --> 01:19:43,598
Everybody is waiting anxiously.

1123
01:19:43,669 --> 01:19:44,370
everybody?

1124
01:19:44,676 --> 01:19:46,470
So there are a lot of satans behind this?

1125
01:19:46,770 --> 01:19:49,475
then how we paying you,
such a big amount?

1126
01:19:49,496 --> 01:19:51,293
Look, you should finish off,
that old man soon as possible.

1127
01:19:51,584 --> 01:19:53,557
they are all waiting for you, come fast.

1128
01:19:53,865 --> 01:19:54,930
you may go. We will follow.

1129
01:19:56,134 --> 01:19:57,900
who are the others waiting?

1130
01:19:57,918 --> 01:19:59,332
those who spend the money.
Come, let's go.

1131
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:00,673
wait, for a minute.

1132
01:20:12,275 --> 01:20:13,275
Ok, let's go.

1133
01:20:13,438 --> 01:20:15,514
why are you taking lethal weapons now?
Keep it there.

1134
01:20:16,249 --> 01:20:18,732
a killer should always be well prepared.

1135
01:20:19,208 --> 01:20:22,475
Can't predict from where the attack comes.

1136
01:20:23,227 --> 01:20:23,786
Come.

1137
01:20:31,164 --> 01:20:31,844
sit down

1138
01:20:31,908 --> 01:20:32,297
no

1139
01:20:33,770 --> 01:20:34,838
he has knife with him

1140
01:20:35,445 --> 01:20:38,142
so you have came with weapons?

1141
01:20:38,478 --> 01:20:38,926
yes

1142
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:41,685
is it time to take weapons?

1143
01:20:42,626 --> 01:20:44,258
you must succeed with your wisdom.

1144
01:20:44,537 --> 01:20:47,109
You keep it all safe.

1145
01:20:47,494 --> 01:20:49,635
they all want to kill him fast.

1146
01:20:49,849 --> 01:20:52,229
don't listen to foolishness.

1147
01:20:52,612 --> 01:20:54,934
The first stage is clean.

1148
01:20:55,332 --> 01:20:57,471
now you need intelligence,
and shrewdness.

1149
01:20:57,788 --> 01:21:00,579
you should get more close to Udayavarma.

1150
01:21:00,891 --> 01:21:06,005
your relation should grow till you get,
the freedom to enter his bedroom.

1151
01:21:06,286 --> 01:21:07,213
then its easy.

1152
01:21:07,420 --> 01:21:08,145
l know that

1153
01:21:08,436 --> 01:21:12,099
and you should consult me before killing.

1154
01:21:12,219 --> 01:21:13,150
it's not possible

1155
01:21:13,445 --> 01:21:14,105
why?

1156
01:21:14,328 --> 01:21:17,712
l don't like the credit of my
success, being shared by any others.

1157
01:21:18,946 --> 01:21:21,894
don't waste my valuable time
by calling, me for such

1158
01:21:21,919 --> 01:21:24,588
discussions in future.
Understand these people.

1159
01:21:26,801 --> 01:21:28,149
he's gone

1160
01:21:28,596 --> 01:21:30,921
looks like hess superb.

1161
01:21:31,735 --> 01:21:35,718
my dear Janaki tell the thing
plainly without any formality.

1162
01:21:36,270 --> 01:21:39,754
we have found a boy for Soudamini.

1163
01:21:40,091 --> 01:21:41,273
Brother must talk to him.

1164
01:21:41,661 --> 01:21:42,260
who is the boy?

1165
01:21:42,571 --> 01:21:44,651
Ananthan Namboodiri

1166
01:21:47,861 --> 01:21:50,121
looks like he likes her

1167
01:21:52,394 --> 01:21:55,635
once he had appreciated her.

1168
01:21:56,112 --> 01:21:58,963
does it means that he likes her?

1169
01:21:59,329 --> 01:22:01,386
maybe if you talk to him

1170
01:22:05,004 --> 01:22:05,908
Janaki, you may go.

1171
01:22:13,203 --> 01:22:18,278
Krishna is in search of,
new springs of cow-herdesses.

knowing the real meaning of the lines.

1176
01:22:34,773 --> 01:22:36,667
oh! don't you know the teacher?

1177
01:22:36,974 --> 01:22:38,394
She is academy award winner.

1178
01:22:38,705 --> 01:22:40,161
is it a license to sing as she wish?

1179
01:22:40,730 --> 01:22:43,516
did radha will get its melody accurately?

1180
01:22:43,583 --> 01:22:46,982
sir, this is not music concert.
This is Mohiniyattam

1181
01:22:47,231 --> 01:22:50,670

the rhythm will be in disorder.

1182
01:22:50,765 --> 01:22:53,082

1183

1232
01:29:08,065 --> 01:29:09,603
Dressed up to show-off. ldiot.

1233
01:29:10,605 --> 01:29:12,226
hey, what a senseless talk is this?

1234
01:29:12,293 --> 01:29:13,065
you are senseless.

1235
01:29:13,415 --> 01:29:14,297
Get out,

1236
01:29:14,956 --> 01:29:18,741
l will break your legs,
if you step inside this mansion.

1237
01:29:19,334 --> 01:29:20,987
are you insulting
after inviting?

1238
01:29:20,995 --> 01:29:22,423
no, l won't bear this.

1239
01:29:22,726 --> 01:29:23,649
This is really bad.

1240
01:29:25,996 --> 01:29:31,316
what a good alliance, You spoiled it.
l made brother say ok too.

1241
01:29:31,978 --> 01:29:33,036
good alliance?

1242
01:29:33,426 --> 01:29:38,019
My god, how can l explain this?

1243
01:29:38,648 --> 01:29:40,947
he is the one and only
son, of a great family.

1244
01:29:41,059 --> 01:29:43,299
What a glorious Namboodiri.

1245
01:29:43,898 --> 01:29:46,376
what qualification do you
have, to deserve such a man?

1246
01:29:46,632 --> 01:29:49,469
l will done this marriage with the help,
of brother in spite of your opposition.

1247
01:29:50,103 --> 01:29:54,260
my dear janu, he is neither a
namboodiri nor a nair. then?

1248
01:29:54,346 --> 01:29:57,389
then, you better not know
that for the time being

1249
01:29:57,482 --> 01:29:59,907
no, l must know who is he

1250
01:30:01,121 --> 01:30:03,892
oh! l am in a dilemma. My goddess,

1251
01:30:11,186 --> 01:30:13,955
what a trial, my god!

1252
01:30:13,955 --> 01:30:16,292
don't make it an issue by giving publicity.

1253
01:30:16,372 --> 01:30:19,137
why you reveal it, Uncle?
Everybody used to say my

1254
01:30:19,162 --> 01:30:21,763
father is a fool. But the
bigger fool is uncle.

1255
01:30:22,109 --> 01:30:25,635
then do you say that l must, marry my
daughter to a man, of another caste?

1256
01:30:28,596 --> 01:30:33,965
enough of crying and
complaints,so stop now

1257
01:30:34,645 --> 01:30:38,793
what is revealed
should not be passed on to anybody.

1258
01:30:39,716 --> 01:30:42,275
are you sure, the children
have no idea about this?

1259
01:30:42,975 --> 01:30:45,751
they don't know, my
Soudamini and Mohini will

1260
01:30:45,776 --> 01:30:48,430
die broken, if they
come to know about this

1261
01:30:48,802 --> 01:30:51,891
they are so fond of their uncle

1262
01:30:52,581 --> 01:30:53,605
then what about my Ambika?

1263
01:30:54,119 --> 01:30:56,446
God! What will l do?

1264
01:30:57,519 --> 01:31:00,844
uncle, please try, not to
afflict him a painful death.

1265
01:31:02,124 --> 01:31:03,801
what is destined will take place.

1266
01:31:04,664 --> 01:31:07,197
act as if you know nothing about this.

1267
01:31:08,671 --> 01:31:12,718
don't forget that if you do
foolery, your own children

1268
01:31:12,743 --> 01:31:16,275
and your husbands, will
be put behind the bars.

1269
01:31:16,972 --> 01:31:19,651
how can we bear this uncle?

1270
01:31:19,977 --> 01:31:21,117
you have to

1271
01:31:21,598 --> 01:31:24,321
didn't Gandhari held
on, even when her 1 01

1272
01:31:24,346 --> 01:31:27,192
children died, in the
war of the Kurukshetra?

1273
01:31:27,538 --> 01:31:29,189
this is nothing!

1274
01:31:31,455 --> 01:31:38,841
does anybody want to lose property..
worth around 50 lakh rupees?

1275
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:43,576
if so, stop this plan at this stage.

1276
01:31:43,974 --> 01:31:44,547
Tell frankly.

1277
01:31:45,094 --> 01:31:46,101
think no one want it so.

1278
01:31:51,355 --> 01:31:53,234
no right?

1279
01:31:54,103 --> 01:31:59,527
Ravi, tell him the third
phase,may be begun.

1280
01:32:18,150 --> 01:32:18,764
check

1281
01:32:22,540 --> 01:32:23,549
trapped. ls it?

1282
01:32:24,106 --> 01:32:24,637
yes

1283
01:32:29,866 --> 01:32:30,604
horse

1284
01:32:32,533 --> 01:32:33,650
castle

1285
01:32:39,075 --> 01:32:41,067
no way out for the king?

1286
01:32:41,869 --> 01:32:42,556
no

1287
01:32:44,833 --> 01:32:45,693
l accept defeat

1288
01:32:46,557 --> 01:32:50,208
the king fell to a pawn.

1289
01:32:51,967 --> 01:32:52,951
l accept defeat.

1290
01:32:54,721 --> 01:32:57,432
see, since you won,
shall l ask you, one thing?

1291
01:32:58,286 --> 01:33:01,456
do you have any idea in your
mind, to save the king?

1292
01:33:04,602 --> 01:33:06,984
just to know

1293
01:33:08,063 --> 01:33:09,115
no

1294
01:33:09,804 --> 01:33:13,838
l am not playing wisely.
All the moves were flop.

1295
01:33:16,587 --> 01:33:18,023
today l don't have the mood.

1296
01:33:18,655 --> 01:33:20,780
Something is troubling me.

1297
01:33:21,633 --> 01:33:22,634
what's wrong?

1298
01:33:23,696 --> 01:33:25,054
don't know

1299
01:33:26,746 --> 01:33:27,569
l feel mood-off

1300
01:33:30,861 --> 01:33:35,073
in a sense, its all problems.

1301
01:33:35,475 --> 01:33:39,099
so it's better not to think.

1302
01:33:47,588 --> 01:33:52,167
do you want to go there, or stay with me?

1303
01:33:53,148 --> 01:33:53,724
that is,

1304
01:33:53,944 --> 01:33:57,103
then you stay here. l won't sleep.

1305
01:33:57,801 --> 01:33:59,926
So we will spend the night telling stories.

1306
01:34:00,567 --> 01:34:01,783
as you wish

1307
01:34:15,364 --> 01:34:17,136
what's this? l was really frightened.

1308
01:34:17,709 --> 01:34:19,542
l was hiding as Radha was coming

1309
01:34:20,222 --> 01:34:22,563
now you are trying to evade me.

1310
01:34:22,755 --> 01:34:24,473
You know how painful it is?

1311
01:34:24,884 --> 01:34:25,802
What is lacking in me?

1312
01:34:26,586 --> 01:34:27,802
l didn't say so.

1313
01:34:28,280 --> 01:34:29,104
you need not say.

1314
01:34:29,356 --> 01:34:31,532
Guptan has the sense to understand that.

1315
01:34:31,973 --> 01:34:36,262
look, all love Radha with an eye on money.
But l am not like

1316
01:34:36,287 --> 01:34:40,716
that. you yourself should introduce,
our relationship to uncle

1317
01:34:40,774 --> 01:34:41,293
l am going.

1318
01:34:42,125 --> 01:34:43,396
Radha, please listen.

1319
01:34:43,810 --> 01:34:46,271
Don't you give me the
consideration, of an artist?

1320
01:34:46,472 --> 01:34:51,505
l can sing and dance. l am the only nephew
having interest, in poetry and literature.

1321
01:34:51,773 --> 01:34:54,829
if so prove it by singing.
Let me hear.

1322
01:34:55,137 --> 01:34:56,462
who invited you now to this scene?

1323
01:34:56,798 --> 01:34:59,982
what? You only invited
me, to this place no?

1324
01:35:00,183 --> 01:35:04,286
get lost. What a disturbance.
Radha, Radha,

1325
01:35:04,813 --> 01:35:09,057
look, if she doesn't like you,
then why are you following her?

1326
01:35:09,116 --> 01:35:12,304
don't talk to me. You are the
main reason behind Radha's

1327
01:35:12,329 --> 01:35:15,604
dislike to me. you have the
egoistic feeling. that you are

1328
01:35:15,629 --> 01:35:18,592
an artist. A man with good voice.
need not be a good

1329
01:35:18,617 --> 01:35:21,915
singer. There is a limit for patience.
Mind it you monkey.

1330
01:35:22,778 --> 01:35:24,723
you only look like a monkey.

1331
01:35:28,618 --> 01:35:32,368
our knowledge is that there is no
musician, as great as you in South lndia.

1332
01:35:32,685 --> 01:35:34,799
it was recognized by the Government
and the people also.

1333
01:35:35,159 --> 01:35:38,524
Without that you won't get all
these, awards and Padmasree.

1334
01:35:38,773 --> 01:35:40,930
but that Ananathan
Namboodiri says that, all

1335
01:35:40,955 --> 01:35:43,062
these were arranged by,
the power of money.

1336
01:35:43,361 --> 01:35:44,132
oh, l see

1337
01:35:44,427 --> 01:35:48,681
you must come to the palace one day.
we can't bear the

1338
01:35:48,706 --> 01:35:53,191
haughtiness, of that monkey.
That's why l came in person.

1339
01:35:53,664 --> 01:35:54,840
then l want to see him.

1340
01:35:55,089 --> 01:35:57,443
Kochurama, lets go to the palace.

1341
01:35:57,885 --> 01:35:58,616
ok, we will go.

1342
01:36:18,514 --> 01:36:23,158
fine
but the lack of practice is very evident.

1343
01:36:23,325 --> 01:36:24,926
it's long since l read

1344
01:36:25,190 --> 01:36:30,252
you should practice daily. Don't
waste the God-given talents.

1345
01:36:31,434 --> 01:36:33,081
dad,

1346
01:36:35,152 --> 01:36:37,427
look who is this, Come, come

1347
01:36:41,835 --> 01:36:42,420
please sit

1348
01:36:43,241 --> 01:36:44,123
don't you know,

1349
01:36:44,330 --> 01:36:47,626
Ramanattukara Ananthan Namboodiri?
He had won 'padmasree' recently.

1350
01:36:48,374 --> 01:36:48,990
no

1351
01:36:49,895 --> 01:36:53,094
but see, he is very close to,

1352
01:36:53,245 --> 01:36:55,618
l know he must be Ananthan
Namboothiripad, isn't it?

1353
01:36:55,634 --> 01:36:56,077
yes.

1354
01:36:56,761 --> 01:36:58,221
l have heard a lot about you.

1355
01:36:58,444 --> 01:37:01,265
what have you heard? The snob
who bought Padmasree, by paying

1356
01:37:01,290 --> 01:37:04,064
money, the ignorant who is,
gimmicking with voice. lsn't it?

1357
01:37:04,874 --> 01:37:06,976
why are you talking like this?

1358
01:37:07,109 --> 01:37:11,226
he knows. See man, confidence is good.
But you should not be proud.

1359
01:37:11,491 --> 01:37:13,520
l don't understand what you say.

1360
01:37:13,879 --> 01:37:14,698
l will make you understand.

1361
01:37:15,035 --> 01:37:17,034
l would like to sing with you.

1362
01:37:17,808 --> 01:37:19,162
Kochurama, yes

1363
01:37:22,372 --> 01:37:24,408
l am not for a competition.

1364
01:37:25,222 --> 01:37:27,763
l have heard that music is an ocean.

1365
01:37:28,034 --> 01:37:30,846
l am a boy standing amused,
on the banks of it.

1366
01:37:31,564 --> 01:37:33,669
And you are one who swims in it.

1367
01:37:34,167 --> 01:37:36,412
l am unworthy to even sit in front of you.

1368
01:37:36,748 --> 01:37:38,395
l don't need your concession of praises.

1369
01:37:38,792 --> 01:37:39,511
Start the music.

1370
01:38:55,325 --> 01:38:59,538

01:44:26,135 --> 01:44:34,099
the voice-water drops that falls gently and
flaws like currents in the river Ganga

1402
01:44:56,620 --> 01:45:00,464
Collection of high pitched, low
pitched and medium pitched sound.

1403
01:45:00,489 --> 01:45:04,624
Frantic, resounding, splendid blend,
of the mystic spell 'Om' - music.

1404
01:45:32,882 --> 01:45:37,535
joy..the eternal joy, universal joy-music.
joy..the eternal joy, universal joy-music.

1405
01:45:37,560 --> 01:45:42,213
joy..the eternal joy, universal joy-music.
joy..the eternal joy, universal joy-music.

1406
01:46:00,193 --> 01:46:04,779
joy..the eternal joy, universal joy-music.
joy..the eternal joy, universal joy-music.

1407
01:46:04,804 --> 01:46:09,389
joy..the eternal joy, universal joy-music.
joy..the eternal joy, universal joy-music.

1408
01:46:10,610 --> 01:46:14,747
music

1409
01:46:15,810 --> 01:46:17,629
music

1410
01:46:46,691 --> 01:46:51,048
please allow me to touch your feet

1411
01:47:01,859 --> 01:47:03,870
never bow your head in front of anybody

1412
01:47:07,194 --> 01:47:10,587
how come you were born in my family,
you wicked.

1413
01:47:10,715 --> 01:47:12,184
l did a mistake uncle, l won't repeat.

1414
01:47:12,415 --> 01:47:15,323
this is not fault.
This is a cunning trick.

1415
01:47:16,031 --> 01:47:17,821
what do you gain by calumniating like this?

1416
01:47:18,693 --> 01:47:20,486
do you know what did that Ananthamurthy,
told about you?

1417
01:47:20,507 --> 01:47:21,045
no

1418
01:47:21,276 --> 01:47:21,867
no

1419
01:47:22,327 --> 01:47:26,000
he was wondering how a thistle did
grow, up in such a beautiful garden.

1420
01:47:27,803 --> 01:47:29,698
severe beating is the apt
medicine, for such behavior.

1421
01:47:30,048 --> 01:47:32,168
please don't scold him.

1422
01:47:32,650 --> 01:47:34,353
He might have done it for a joke.

1423
01:47:34,617 --> 01:47:37,765
what pastime?
ls misleading decent people a joke?

1424
01:47:39,414 --> 01:47:43,063
as that Moorthy said, l
will cut down this thistle

1425
01:47:43,088 --> 01:47:46,235
if l happen, to hear
such things about you.

1426
01:47:46,534 --> 01:47:46,921
understand?

1427
01:47:47,159 --> 01:47:47,648
yes

1428
01:47:47,648 --> 01:47:48,196
what yes?

1429
01:47:48,487 --> 01:47:49,761
donkey,

1430
01:47:51,119 --> 01:47:55,250
see mister, today we will have dinner
together. You must come there.

1431
01:47:55,316 --> 01:47:57,254
ok, l will come.

1432
01:48:03,089 --> 01:48:07,021
now l understand the snake will
bite, if pushed to the extreme.

1433
01:48:07,738 --> 01:48:08,737
hello thistle

1434
01:48:08,832 --> 01:48:10,653
thistle is your, monkey

1435
01:48:14,281 --> 01:48:14,971
hey, listen.

1436
01:48:16,774 --> 01:48:19,173
are you dining with His Highness tonight

1437
01:48:19,455 --> 01:48:20,015
yes

1438
01:48:20,545 --> 01:48:21,374
this is the ideal chance.

1439
01:48:22,054 --> 01:48:22,701
Don't be late.

1440
01:48:23,562 --> 01:48:29,000
l want to see that old man's corpse,
in this palace tomorrow morning;

1441
01:48:29,279 --> 01:48:29,860
you understand?

1442
01:48:44,471 --> 01:48:49,411
outsiders think what
a lucky man am l.

1443
01:48:49,794 --> 01:48:52,087
owner
of large amount of property.

1444
01:48:52,536 --> 01:48:53,241
positions,

1445
01:48:54,227 --> 01:48:57,395
epicurean immersed in dance and music.

1446
01:48:59,370 --> 01:49:01,696
but who knows the truth?

1447
01:49:02,201 --> 01:49:04,968
it's like a train.

1448
01:49:05,977 --> 01:49:09,938
lt's dashing and whistling with ecstacy.

1449
01:49:10,786 --> 01:49:13,577
but burning inside

1450
01:49:24,773 --> 01:49:27,450
your today's song was superb

1451
01:49:27,953 --> 01:49:33,108
no, it's more than that
l felt like my last wish is fulfilled.

1452
01:49:33,154 --> 01:49:34,148
Really satisfied.

1453
01:49:36,430 --> 01:49:40,357
there was a musician, called
Amirkhan Sahib in Malabar.

1454
01:49:41,951 --> 01:49:45,235
you sing in his style.

1455
01:49:46,380 --> 01:49:50,953
he had sang a lot here during,
my grand uncle's days.

1456
01:49:51,553 --> 01:49:54,565
we had slept in the same bedroom.

1457
01:49:56,663 --> 01:49:59,202
he might be no more now.

1458
01:50:02,964 --> 01:50:03,791
died

1459
01:50:04,703 --> 01:50:05,240
is it?

1460
01:50:12,380 --> 01:50:13,476
do you feel hungry?

1461
01:50:15,763 --> 01:50:17,311
shall we go out?

1462
01:50:18,142 --> 01:50:20,008
then don't you want food?

1463
01:50:20,210 --> 01:50:20,835
we will have it after that.

1464
01:50:22,814 --> 01:50:24,069
there's bright moonlight today.

1465
01:50:25,185 --> 01:50:30,185
isn't it nice to talk in the open space?

1466
01:50:31,250 --> 01:50:36,667
me and Raman Menon use to go
out, like this once in a while.

1467
01:50:37,686 --> 01:50:42,287
and simply walk here and there till dawn.

1468
01:50:45,468 --> 01:50:46,459
so, shall we go?

1469
01:50:47,202 --> 01:50:49,430
just a minute.

1470
01:51:35,311 --> 01:51:39,444
blood relation. do you feel
that there is such a relation?

1471
01:51:41,631 --> 01:51:46,239
relationship is in one's heart.
Your relative may be your enemy.

1472
01:51:47,359 --> 01:51:49,181
l don't trust anybody

1473
01:51:49,985 --> 01:51:50,511
me too?

1474
01:51:51,782 --> 01:51:56,288
you?
l have faith in you.

1475
01:51:56,924 --> 01:51:59,337
you are a good man man
with a heart .

1476
01:52:01,838 --> 01:52:02,965
do you know?

1477
01:52:03,843 --> 01:52:07,981
my Radha, she is
my greatest asset.

1478
01:52:08,673 --> 01:52:11,326
it was she who made up, for
the absence of my Unni,

1479
01:52:12,142 --> 01:52:16,041
she, she is daughter.
my own daughter

1480
01:52:17,774 --> 01:52:18,686
are you shocked?

1481
01:52:19,711 --> 01:52:23,934
you thought she is born in my relationship,
with that servant

1482
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:24,591
no

1483
01:52:25,670 --> 01:52:32,475
she might not be my own daughter not born
in my blood, but she was born in my mind.

1484
01:52:33,155 --> 01:52:38,167
Accepted as my real daughter
she is equal to a thousand sons.

1485
01:52:40,192 --> 01:52:43,154
l want some one to take care of her,
even after my death.

1486
01:52:44,222 --> 01:52:52,579
she is not at all ambitious but
l know she likes you very much.

1487
01:52:52,913 --> 01:52:57,587
my lord, l am not the person as you think.

1488
01:52:57,830 --> 01:52:59,581
l am happy.

1489
01:53:00,994 --> 01:53:04,332
you are like my Unni now.

1490
01:53:05,669 --> 01:53:06,319
careful

1491
01:53:11,090 --> 01:53:18,791
my Unni would have been your age, if
he was alive today. and your color. as

1492
01:53:18,816 --> 01:53:27,124
innocent face like this. you held my hand
when l wavered. this is my Unni's hand.

1493
01:53:27,803 --> 01:53:31,855
this is my Unni's hand.

1494
01:53:34,564 --> 01:53:35,329
isn't it so?

1495
01:53:36,041 --> 01:53:38,233
you are drunken too much

1496
01:53:51,330 --> 01:53:54,365
bull shit.
what a foolishness did you do?

1497
01:53:56,278 --> 01:53:58,897
it was a desolate palce.
midnight you could

1498
01:53:58,922 --> 01:54:01,779
have finished him of, by
just pushing him down.

1499
01:54:02,138 --> 01:54:03,559
You wont get another golden chance.

1500
01:54:04,077 --> 01:54:05,132
Are you a killer?

1501
01:54:05,342 --> 01:54:07,292
don't question the merit of a killer?

1502
01:54:07,684 --> 01:54:10,859
This is not as easy killing a hen. l have
to kill a human being. Don't forget it.

1503
01:54:10,866 --> 01:54:11,949
you set out knowing this no?

1504
01:54:12,047 --> 01:54:12,367
yes

1505
01:54:13,122 --> 01:54:15,583
Just killing a man is simple.

1506
01:54:15,750 --> 01:54:16,413
anyone can do

1507
01:54:16,701 --> 01:54:17,973
You want me to kill you now?

1508
01:54:18,234 --> 01:54:19,813
l will do it without
anyone else noticing it.

1509
01:54:20,121 --> 01:54:21,663
what are you upto? l was just saying

1510
01:54:23,120 --> 01:54:23,994
what?

1511
01:54:24,149 --> 01:54:25,231
there must be a change.

1512
01:54:26,403 --> 01:54:31,769
be it music or murder,
l always want to do things in a novel way.

1513
01:54:32,032 --> 01:54:33,320
l could have killed him yesterday

1514
01:54:34,078 --> 01:54:37,009
but what use in resorting to old,
conventional ways?

1515
01:54:37,892 --> 01:54:39,832
a killer always want to have,
mental satisfaction.

1516
01:54:39,903 --> 01:54:40,589
bull shit.

1517
01:54:41,130 --> 01:54:44,524
We spend money not for a killer's mental
satisfaction. for our plans materialize.

1518
01:54:44,814 --> 01:54:46,232
don't worry.

1519
01:54:46,833 --> 01:54:48,391
you need to own the property, isn't it?

1520
01:54:48,917 --> 01:54:53,588
let me talk to His Highness. As he is in
terms with me now, he will agree to it.

1521
01:54:53,981 --> 01:54:55,489
Can't we avoid bloodshed?

1522
01:54:55,762 --> 01:54:56,850
good idea.

1523
01:54:56,926 --> 01:54:59,832
You better be a parish
priest or a preacher.

1524
01:55:00,169 --> 01:55:01,260
shall l tell a truth, dear friend?

1525
01:55:01,535 --> 01:55:02,761
l also feel like becoming one.

1526
01:55:03,863 --> 01:55:05,063
l will tell a truth.

1527
01:55:05,376 --> 01:55:09,887
you may be thinking that, we
members of the royal family

1528
01:55:09,912 --> 01:55:14,081
are simple. warriors' blood
flows through our veins.

1529
01:55:14,106 --> 01:55:18,458
We don't mind killing and being killed.
We won't spare

1530
01:55:18,483 --> 01:55:22,517
you if you try to fool us.
Understand? You donkey!

1531
01:55:22,568 --> 01:55:23,177
hey, highness

1532
01:55:23,554 --> 01:55:24,451
hey, what

1533
01:55:27,796 --> 01:55:29,011
oh! This is like holding a tiger's tail.

1534
01:55:29,565 --> 01:55:32,101
l'm trapped here my god.

1535
01:55:36,304 --> 01:55:38,188
you prefer to have a compromise, is it?

1536
01:55:45,999 --> 01:55:51,906
no, l was just kidding to, Ravivarma
Thampuran. you took it serious?

1537
01:55:53,625 --> 01:55:58,885
l'm working out a new strategy. a
plan that even God will not know

1538
01:55:58,978 --> 01:55:59,725
what's it?

1539
01:56:00,208 --> 01:56:01,302
come on, tell

1540
01:56:03,118 --> 01:56:07,374
l do not disclose my plans.

1541
01:56:08,026 --> 01:56:10,068
l only prove it by executing.

1542
01:56:10,279 --> 01:56:13,411
l know that you are cunning.

1543
01:56:14,213 --> 01:56:18,601
but you have started showing
your, true color to me too.

1544
01:56:19,190 --> 01:56:20,333
that's not fair.

1545
01:56:20,928 --> 01:56:24,215
l too know bigger tricks.

1546
01:56:24,529 --> 01:56:30,855
Arjunan killed Bhishma by placing eunuch
as a cover. Do you know that story?

1547
01:56:31,147 --> 01:56:31,965
l have heard it

1548
01:56:32,234 --> 01:56:34,391
remember that always.

1549
01:56:34,668 --> 01:56:41,650
l had fought a war. Know strategies too.
So don't be a eunuch.

1550
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:46,493
This is 20th century, Last of the 4 ages,
Did you understand.

1551
01:56:47,312 --> 01:56:48,881
no l didn't.

1552
01:56:49,785 --> 01:56:53,698
you will come to know, about
it at the right time.

1553
01:56:54,456 --> 01:56:56,934
Balaraman

1554
01:57:07,951 --> 01:57:09,192
don't be a eunuch.

1555
01:57:09,502 --> 01:57:11,451
This is 20th century.

1556
01:57:20,724 --> 01:57:21,798
Oh, you are here,

1557
01:57:22,110 --> 01:57:24,567
how long l have been searching for you,

1558
01:57:26,772 --> 01:57:29,799
why didn't you come to see mom?

1559
01:57:30,157 --> 01:57:30,837
no nothing

1560
01:57:32,126 --> 01:57:34,292
why there is a change today?

1561
01:57:34,475 --> 01:57:35,001
what change?

1562
01:57:35,732 --> 01:57:37,536
you used to be in joking mood.

1563
01:57:38,187 --> 01:57:42,015
you may go Radha. We will meet later.

1564
01:57:42,456 --> 01:57:43,864
am l a disturbance?

1565
01:57:44,143 --> 01:57:44,811
no.

1566
01:57:45,717 --> 01:57:48,898
you should tell me if you feel so.

1567
01:57:51,263 --> 01:57:56,773
l donit have any idea about how to behave
and what to say to great people.

1568
01:57:59,929 --> 01:58:01,772
what's your birthday star?

1569
01:58:02,224 --> 01:58:02,842
birthday star?

1570
01:58:03,499 --> 01:58:06,347
lts... Aswati

1571
01:58:07,548 --> 01:58:08,305
why you want to know that?

1572
01:58:08,399 --> 01:58:10,123
l shall offer flowers to the Goddess.

1573
01:58:10,566 --> 01:58:16,269
And l shall pray to find a solution
to, the matter troubling you.

1574
01:58:39,883 --> 01:58:40,737
Jamal

1575
01:58:47,367 --> 01:58:49,960
disclose your identity.
Then only you can go in.

1576
01:58:50,196 --> 01:58:53,332
oh, God! This security is tighter than,
that in the parliament.

1577
01:58:53,690 --> 01:58:55,824
We will meet when we come back.

1578
01:58:56,109 --> 01:58:57,325
that won't do.

1579
01:58:57,443 --> 01:58:58,949
What's the name of the person
whom, you are going to meet?

1580
01:58:59,026 --> 01:59:00,366
yes, he has a name. Abdulla.

1581
01:59:00,425 --> 01:59:01,464
Abdullah? Who is that?

1582
01:59:01,720 --> 01:59:04,848
lsn't it? His name is something like that.

1583
01:59:06,193 --> 01:59:07,266
look, he is the one.

1584
01:59:07,992 --> 01:59:10,240
but he is not Abdulla.

1585
01:59:10,505 --> 01:59:12,222
l am so forgetful.

1586
01:59:12,456 --> 01:59:15,744
what is this, Sankunni Nair?
This man always forget my name.

1587
01:59:16,548 --> 01:59:17,296
Sankunni Nair? Who is that?

1588
01:59:17,341 --> 01:59:18,178
l'll tell you. Please come.

1589
01:59:22,279 --> 01:59:24,608
oh, my Jamal! Don't you have sense?
l had told you

1590
01:59:24,633 --> 01:59:26,824
a hundred times that, l
am Ananthan Namboodiri,

1591
01:59:27,116 --> 01:59:28,906
you have improved a lot.

1592
01:59:29,042 --> 01:59:30,368
but this is not going to last long.

1593
01:59:31,090 --> 01:59:33,404
what happened?
things are all messed up.

1594
01:59:33,658 --> 01:59:36,459
We will talk in detail.
First you hire a room outside.

1595
01:59:36,742 --> 01:59:37,712
why? Can't l stay in this palace?

1596
01:59:37,912 --> 01:59:39,986
you cannot survive here,
with this type of language.

1597
01:59:40,293 --> 01:59:42,845
don't worry. Everything will be okay.

1598
01:59:43,056 --> 01:59:45,433
no one will understand
if you say like this. no

1599
01:59:45,439 --> 01:59:48,043
then you come. not in that direction.
come, walk.

1600
01:59:52,699 --> 01:59:55,088
this is like holding a tiger's tail,
my Abdu.

1601
01:59:55,454 --> 01:59:58,318
people in this royal family are
not as, harmless as we think.

1602
01:59:59,044 --> 02:00:03,450
there is an elderly person. Sakuni.
he is a blind man with a 1 000 eyes.

1603
02:00:03,710 --> 02:00:06,454
that grand old man is pulling the,
ropes from behind.

1604
02:00:07,038 --> 02:00:10,804
he told me a simile the other day.

1605
02:00:11,026 --> 02:00:14,818
l didn't get the meaning at that time.
Later l got it's meaning

1606
02:00:15,069 --> 02:00:15,669
what was that?

1607
02:00:16,459 --> 02:00:20,153
Arjunan assassinated Bhishman..
placing eunuch as a

1608
02:00:20,178 --> 02:00:23,800
cover. So don't be a eunuch.
This is 20th century.

1609
02:00:23,876 --> 02:00:25,440
Oho! When did such an event take place?

1610
02:00:25,722 --> 02:00:27,191
hey, that's a legend.

1611
02:00:27,486 --> 02:00:29,515
oh, l see! Old story?

1612
02:00:29,772 --> 02:00:34,621
this is the use of reading good books

1613
02:00:34,988 --> 02:00:38,095
look, what is the big meaning..
in this mythology?

1614
02:00:38,124 --> 02:00:39,047
meaning?

1615
02:00:39,350 --> 02:00:41,552
they may be planning to
kill His Highness, with the

1616
02:00:41,577 --> 02:00:43,779
help of someone else, and
project me as the killer.

1617
02:00:44,072 --> 02:00:45,576
if all the others together
give evidence, against

1618
02:00:45,601 --> 02:00:46,953
me that l am the killer,
won't l be trapped?

1619
02:00:47,219 --> 02:00:49,811
when l am questioned, what can l say,
if they ask for what did l come?

1620
02:00:49,941 --> 02:00:52,028
When they come to know that l have
disguised in a pseudo name

1621
02:00:53,040 --> 02:00:59,263
No doubt, you will be caught. Now a days
the food in jail is good. Our Kabir dada

1622
02:00:59,288 --> 02:01:05,813
told me when he came, out in parole that he
was served, biriyani twice a day in jail.

1623
02:01:06,070 --> 02:01:09,328
you trapped me into this ditch and still.

1624
02:01:09,555 --> 02:01:13,748
l did so with a good intension,
dear Abdulla. Now no question

1625
02:01:13,773 --> 02:01:17,492
of looking back. Let's escape
before anything happens.

1626
02:01:18,052 --> 02:01:19,448
l thought of that option too.

1627
02:01:20,076 --> 02:01:24,651
they will kill His Highness the moment,
they come to know that we have escaped.

1628
02:01:26,208 --> 02:01:28,408
and what will we do if they say that we,
are absconding after the assassination?

1629
02:01:29,361 --> 02:01:30,904
everybody will believe it.

1630
02:01:31,087 --> 02:01:34,378
this is like some old saying, my
namboodiri. lf l don't tell the

1631
02:01:34,403 --> 02:01:37,996
truth, dad will eat dog meat. lf l
tell the truth, mom will be beaten.

1632
02:01:38,251 --> 02:01:39,172
tell me what should l do.

1633
02:01:42,928 --> 02:01:50,619
my dear son, anyway we are trapped in
tis game. Why not we change sides?

1634
02:01:52,710 --> 02:01:54,766
you are not bold enough to kill,

1635
02:01:55,028 --> 02:01:57,358
His Highness. forget it.
We are not killing him.

1636
02:01:57,623 --> 02:01:58,739
then they will kill..

1637
02:01:58,987 --> 02:02:00,292
and we will be indicted.

1638
02:02:00,564 --> 02:02:01,913
we won't let them do it.

1639
02:02:02,125 --> 02:02:02,530
that means?

1640
02:02:02,737 --> 02:02:06,300
do you have the guts to block them?

1641
02:02:09,291 --> 02:02:12,129
yes, l have.

1642
02:02:12,849 --> 02:02:15,484
Menon,

1643
02:02:15,659 --> 02:02:19,554
what's your opinion about our,
Ananthan Namboodiri?

1644
02:02:20,052 --> 02:02:21,882
fine body.

1645
02:02:21,960 --> 02:02:22,759
not that.

1646
02:02:23,220 --> 02:02:25,220
Will he accept an
employment, in this palace?

1647
02:02:26,363 --> 02:02:27,192
l don't think so.

1648
02:02:28,031 --> 02:02:32,977
lts difficult for artists to work,
based in a responsible post.

1649
02:02:33,558 --> 02:02:35,165
Still, we will have a try.

1650
02:02:35,787 --> 02:02:38,357
he is trustworthy.

1651
02:02:38,620 --> 02:02:43,384
not only that.
l have certain other ideas also in my mind.

1652
02:02:43,668 --> 02:02:44,572
l know, l know.

1653
02:02:44,810 --> 02:02:45,695
how do you know that?

1654
02:02:46,058 --> 02:02:47,235
it's about Radhika, isn't it?

1655
02:02:47,477 --> 02:02:49,330
you

1656
02:02:49,987 --> 02:02:51,948
you are really a wise man.

1657
02:02:53,495 --> 02:02:56,782
our Ananthan Namboodiri
is waiting to see you.

1658
02:02:57,072 --> 02:02:58,682
waiting to see me?

1659
02:02:58,923 --> 02:03:00,766
Does he need permission to enter?

1660
02:03:00,847 --> 02:03:01,394
Tell him to come in.

1661
02:03:01,642 --> 02:03:02,022
yes majesty.

1662
02:03:02,288 --> 02:03:03,494
There is another man also with him.

1663
02:03:04,192 --> 02:03:05,911
just a minute, Menon.

1664
02:03:10,407 --> 02:03:11,162
he is coming.

1665
02:03:16,590 --> 02:03:18,151
who is the new guy?

1666
02:03:18,432 --> 02:03:21,057
Sankunni Nair, is one of
the managers in my house.

1667
02:03:21,808 --> 02:03:23,490
where are you from?

1668
02:03:23,787 --> 02:03:24,837
he is from near my house.

1669
02:03:25,800 --> 02:03:28,478
did you come to take him away?

1670
02:03:29,135 --> 02:03:30,731
l won't allow him to go back home.

1671
02:03:30,942 --> 02:03:31,682
no need.

1672
02:03:36,431 --> 02:03:39,846
he wanted to discuss, a few
family matters with me.

1673
02:03:41,249 --> 02:03:45,358
do you mind if he stays,
with me for some time?

1674
02:03:45,655 --> 02:03:48,628
no, no.l have no problem. if
you want you may bring all at,

1675
02:03:48,653 --> 02:03:51,674
your home to this place and stay with you.
lt's my pleasure.

1676
02:03:51,979 --> 02:03:54,132
so you may proceed.

1677
02:03:54,537 --> 02:04:00,746
l was going through some accounts.
Thought of calling you. Anyway, not now.

1678
02:04:01,367 --> 02:04:02,446
we will see in the night. okay

1679
02:04:06,054 --> 02:04:06,876
What did you say? eh..
come here

1680
02:04:10,508 --> 02:04:16,716
my namboodiri, you are really smart. a
king is dealing with you like a friend.

1681
02:04:17,005 --> 02:04:18,068
what a nice man!

1682
02:04:18,648 --> 02:04:20,420
Did you notice the glory on his face?

1683
02:04:20,521 --> 02:04:25,590
now l understand that you said is
right even if any killer elephant

1684
02:04:25,615 --> 02:04:30,086
tries, or offer gold one cannot
feel like hurting this man.

1685
02:04:30,364 --> 02:04:32,231
don't we have to go to the other satan?

1686
02:04:32,520 --> 02:04:33,471
we will go at night.

1687
02:04:33,526 --> 02:04:34,307
not now?

1688
02:04:34,602 --> 02:04:35,396
then come.

1689
02:04:35,955 --> 02:04:37,541
who is this new guy?

1690
02:04:37,854 --> 02:04:40,520
he is my friend and aide.

1691
02:04:40,889 --> 02:04:44,353
what is your new plan?

1692
02:04:45,138 --> 02:04:46,216
we will plan together

1693
02:04:46,234 --> 02:04:47,808
there's nothing of the sort.

1694
02:04:48,083 --> 02:04:49,852
He says he can't carry
out the assassination.

1695
02:04:49,864 --> 02:04:50,280
what?

1696
02:04:50,370 --> 02:04:54,333
yes that's the truth. l cannot
kill anybody. l am not a killer

1697
02:04:54,573 --> 02:04:56,836
then for what did you come to this place,
accepting the advance amount? To shave?

1698
02:04:57,044 --> 02:05:00,088
Ravi varma..
let him say what he has to say.

1699
02:05:00,359 --> 02:05:03,565
nothing in detail. We have defected.

1700
02:05:03,784 --> 02:05:05,586
not you, let him say.

1701
02:05:05,853 --> 02:05:11,314
l have no experience killing any body. l
tried my best to do that, but my limbs

1702
02:05:11,339 --> 02:05:16,366
are shivering. l am a poor singer. l
agreed to take up this task because,

1703
02:05:16,391 --> 02:05:21,237
l was badly in need of money. l have
spent only 1 000 rupees from, the

1704
02:05:21,262 --> 02:05:26,585
advance. l will give back the rest. shall
we settle things in a peaceful way?

1705
02:05:26,753 --> 02:05:28,938
l will kill and bury both of you dogs!

1706
02:05:29,107 --> 02:05:29,677
Kesavapillai,

1707
02:05:30,540 --> 02:05:34,057
it is wise to keep mum sword
should be fought with a sword

1708
02:05:34,082 --> 02:05:37,300
and, an arrow should be
tackled with , another arrow.

1709
02:05:37,561 --> 02:05:38,895
let the boys go.

1710
02:05:39,614 --> 02:05:45,135
don't show off citing similes. l
have seen a lot of dadas in Bombay.

1711
02:05:45,212 --> 02:05:46,096
me too

1712
02:05:46,355 --> 02:05:49,695
yes, so we are not going
to withdraw in fear.

1713
02:05:49,955 --> 02:05:54,699
l became a bit closer to His Highness.
not only that, since we have decided to

1714
02:05:54,724 --> 02:05:59,886
retreat, isn't it fair to reveal
the intention behind our visit

1715
02:05:59,980 --> 02:06:02,122
we should keep manners every where.

1716
02:06:02,611 --> 02:06:07,809
You may go only after enjoying life..
with Udayavarma for a few more days.

1717
02:06:08,056 --> 02:06:08,839
so shall we go?

1718
02:06:09,048 --> 02:06:12,045
you may go my dear boys

1719
02:06:16,649 --> 02:06:20,351
didn't l warn you that sweetness, is
increasing? now see what has happened

1720
02:06:21,052 --> 02:06:22,613
will they be dangerous uncle?

1721
02:06:23,003 --> 02:06:25,316
the control is still at our hands

1722
02:06:25,855 --> 02:06:27,412
don't be late

1723
02:06:28,614 --> 02:06:32,097
l run out of ideas, my lord
l had told them itself that

1724
02:06:32,122 --> 02:06:35,728
this, ill be a foolishness.
But nobody gave a heed to it.

1725
02:06:35,949 --> 02:06:39,797
now we will be losing whatever
we were, about to get, my

1726
02:06:39,822 --> 02:06:43,737
Madhavi its better escape from
here, as early as possible

1727
02:06:43,995 --> 02:06:45,170
where will we go?

1728
02:06:45,674 --> 02:06:47,343
Do you have a house of your own?

1729
02:06:48,880 --> 02:06:51,370
will that Muslim boy tell
all the stories to brother?

1730
02:06:51,602 --> 02:06:54,536
who knows?
Let's hope that won't.

1731
02:06:54,801 --> 02:06:56,992
And if he say it will
be harmful to him also.

1732
02:06:57,645 --> 02:06:58,502
hey, it's me.

1733
02:06:59,499 --> 02:07:01,567
oh, you frightened me

1734
02:07:01,626 --> 02:07:04,383
oh, you frightened me Subadra aunty and
uncle started, packing everything.

1735
02:07:04,408 --> 02:07:07,200
We will have to escape at any moment.
We also must get ready, isn't it dad?

1736
02:07:07,449 --> 02:07:10,759
after getting ready,
where will we go?

1737
02:07:56,843 --> 02:07:58,344

please have the patience
to listen, to what l say.

1747
02:08:35,388 --> 02:08:37,048
what you said is right.

1748
02:08:38,140 --> 02:08:39,230
l was cheating you

1749
02:08:39,795 --> 02:08:44,670
l was cheating you by disguising.

1750
02:08:46,629 --> 02:08:47,585
l am Abdulla.

1751
02:08:49,053 --> 02:08:52,002
Abdulla disguised as Ananthan..
with a bad intention

1752
02:08:52,498 --> 02:08:54,377
to kill you

1753
02:08:59,920 --> 02:09:00,498
but

1754
02:09:01,055 --> 02:09:02,558
l cannot do that

1755
02:09:07,048 --> 02:09:07,983
couldn't you kill me?

1756
02:09:09,173 --> 02:09:11,186
you had better killed
me than fooling me.

1757
02:09:14,176 --> 02:09:17,066
when l held your hand
considering you as my son.

1758
02:09:17,091 --> 02:09:20,098
when l slept with you
couldn't you have killed me?

1759
02:09:20,891 --> 02:09:22,591
please, believe me.

1760
02:09:24,459 --> 02:09:27,730
now l am staying
here , to save you.

1761
02:09:27,818 --> 02:09:29,509
you want me to trust you again?
yes,

1762
02:09:30,004 --> 02:09:32,274
you must.
You are in danger.

1763
02:09:32,848 --> 02:09:34,147
your relatives will kill you.

1764
02:09:35,067 --> 02:09:36,201
you must escape somehow.

1765
02:09:36,447 --> 02:09:38,252
l am ready to die for you.

1766
02:09:38,327 --> 02:09:39,467
l don't want to escape.

1767
02:09:39,722 --> 02:09:42,103
Let anybody kill me.

1768
02:09:42,443 --> 02:09:45,163
Still you need not save me.
l won't believe you.

1769
02:09:45,492 --> 02:09:46,765
believe me.

1770
02:09:47,279 --> 02:09:49,733
you must believe me.

1771
02:09:50,333 --> 02:09:54,458
l am requesting you like your son.
please forgive me.

1772
02:09:54,769 --> 02:09:56,558

1773
02:09:56,829 --> 02:09:57,424
stop it.

1774
02:09:58,050 --> 02:09:59,185
You are acting brilliantly.

1775
02:09:59,866 --> 02:10:04,805
Leave here at once. Or
else, l will kill you.

1776
02:10:14,080 --> 02:10:17,159
how can we trust people.

1777
02:10:18,454 --> 02:10:20,088
brother Jamal,

1778
02:10:20,555 --> 02:10:27,114
we are not going to leave this
palace, until the destiny is clear.

1779
02:10:36,890 --> 02:10:38,207
any idea where has His Highness gone?

1780
02:10:38,430 --> 02:10:40,233
isn't he in the bed room? no

1781
02:10:40,493 --> 02:10:42,356
he may be in deep sleep.

1782
02:10:42,614 --> 02:10:45,558
Radha searched for him everywhere.
Has he left for Nilagiri?

1783
02:10:45,822 --> 02:10:49,244
in that case he would have told me.
ls the car there in the shed? yes

1784
02:10:51,100 --> 02:10:54,637
did he say anything about going,
afar to see Kathakali? no

1785
02:10:56,140 --> 02:10:56,884
then where did he go?

1786
02:10:59,078 --> 02:11:02,741
tell frankly, Mr.Pillai
why should we hide it from each other?

1787
02:11:02,978 --> 02:11:05,449
Menon, l swear, l don't know anything

1788
02:11:05,497 --> 02:11:06,903
heard that some others have come?

1789
02:11:07,537 --> 02:11:10,579
l don't know anything. Uncle and
Ravivarma are planning, and

1790
02:11:10,604 --> 02:11:13,644
deciding everything. l will go
to Madras if l get the ticket

1791
02:11:14,728 --> 02:11:19,337
need not murmur to me.
l am not for any trouble.

1792
02:11:19,858 --> 02:11:20,849
that's good.

1793
02:11:21,127 --> 02:11:22,095
Then why should l bother?

1794
02:11:22,841 --> 02:11:25,384
Those who give girls to these guys,
from this palace must be beaten.

1795
02:11:27,052 --> 02:11:30,609
certain secrets will be come out,
if some people are given nice.

1796
02:11:30,784 --> 02:11:31,610
what is the matter?

1797
02:11:31,856 --> 02:11:35,473
now what to do? Shall we
inform the police, Mr. Menon?

1798
02:11:35,878 --> 02:11:39,067
l also thought so. Let's wait
for one more day.yes, yes

1799
02:11:49,767 --> 02:11:52,813
what is this, dear girl.
Are you crying when your

1800
02:11:52,838 --> 02:11:55,799
, marriage is fixed?
Saraswati, how much jasmine

1801
02:11:55,824 --> 02:11:58,443
flowers are stocked?
Please tell the young

1802
02:11:58,468 --> 02:12:01,330
princess to meet me when
she comes from Venad.

1803
02:12:02,536 --> 02:12:05,195
don't cry in front
of mom, dear girl.

1804
02:12:06,241 --> 02:12:07,846
dad will come back before tonight.

1805
02:12:08,442 --> 02:12:10,431
don't think of unnecessary things.

1806
02:12:14,880 --> 02:12:16,634
Abdulla, Abdulla

1807
02:12:17,305 --> 02:12:20,119
some important people have come.
who is that? come that way.

1808
02:12:23,594 --> 02:12:27,395
that fair guy is
Kabirdada.He is a Gujarathi.

1809
02:12:27,560 --> 02:12:31,967
He is a good man. the man next to him
is his right hand. Chandran nair.

1810
02:12:32,089 --> 02:12:34,913
He is a Malayali. He too is a good man.
l don't the

1811
02:12:34,938 --> 02:12:37,870
name of the man next to him.
But he is a real rascal.

1812
02:12:38,124 --> 02:12:40,015
Rascal means booldy rascal.

1813
02:12:40,328 --> 02:12:43,926
l had a fight with him once.
haven't you seen them before? no

1814
02:12:44,713 --> 02:12:49,093
ha, these are the people to meet. They are
good people. They will fight with hand.

1815
02:12:49,369 --> 02:12:50,711
They learned stunt from Japan.

1816
02:12:57,777 --> 02:12:59,217
they may spare Jamal

1817
02:12:59,513 --> 02:13:00,546
don't mind it.

1818
02:13:00,550 --> 02:13:02,711
lf they
have targeted you, they

1819
02:13:02,736 --> 02:13:04,688
will finish off you.
Business is business.

1820
02:13:04,713 --> 02:13:08,482
relation and friendship is another thing.
l was wondering when they reached here.

1821
02:13:08,537 --> 02:13:12,082
they might have reached 2-3 days back.

1822
02:13:12,355 --> 02:13:15,266
Kabir won't come without getting,
a clear idea about the place.

1823
02:13:15,808 --> 02:13:16,653
what should we do now?

1824
02:13:17,032 --> 02:13:19,095
what is the use of asking
what to do now, when you

1825
02:13:19,120 --> 02:13:21,263
are swallowed almost full
into, the tiger's stomach.

1826
02:13:25,565 --> 02:13:26,082
my god,

1827
02:13:27,001 --> 02:13:28,944
Abdulla, he too gone?

1828
02:13:29,563 --> 02:13:31,019
Abdulla

1829
02:13:32,146 --> 02:13:32,768
Abdulla

1830
02:13:41,493 --> 02:13:43,413
tell me where is His Highness

1831
02:13:43,532 --> 02:13:45,376
l don't know where he is.

1832
02:13:45,723 --> 02:13:47,008
leave me Kabir bhai.

1833
02:13:47,258 --> 02:13:50,378
l am not Kabir bhai to you now.
l am an executioner.

1834
02:13:50,401 --> 02:13:51,087
Why not saying?

1835
02:13:51,106 --> 02:13:51,794
leave me.

1836
02:13:52,032 --> 02:13:54,678

02:14:21,488 --> 02:14:22,435
tell me where is His Highness

1838
02:14:23,654 --> 02:14:24,547

02:14:25,629 --> 02:14:27,597
am asking, tell me
where is His Highness

1840
02:14:27,771 --> 02:14:29,087

1841
02:14:33,498 --> 02:14:34,575
Tell me

1842
02:14:42,909 --> 02:14:43,489

where are you Balarama?

1847
02:15:07,885 --> 02:15:08,748

Madhavi, madhavi

Balarama,

1858
02:17:57,744 --> 02:17:58,481
Balarama

1859
02:18:17,353 --> 02:18:18,096
Balarama

1860
02:18:19,147 --> 02:18:19,915
Balarama

1861
02:18:20,192 --> 02:18:21,467
Balarama where did he go?

1862
02:18:43,825 --> 02:18:46,443
come on, tell me where is Thampuran?

1863
02:18:46,520 --> 02:18:47,631
Mother, tell me.

1864
02:18:48,981 --> 02:18:50,548
leave me, leave me

1865
02:21:12,153 --> 02:21:13,043
don't torment me,

1866
02:21:13,470 --> 02:21:14,109
leave me alone,

1867
02:21:14,972 --> 02:21:17,362
l am going, l am going

1868
02:21:40,275 --> 02:21:41,378
oh my god.

1869
02:21:42,683 --> 02:21:43,266
Abdulla

1870
02:21:48,816 --> 02:21:51,449
Adbulla, god is with us.

1871
02:21:56,097 --> 02:21:56,810
Mister

1872
02:22:00,858 --> 02:22:02,528
Mister, what's this?

1873
02:22:03,190 --> 02:22:04,687
did you kill His Highness

1874
02:22:09,004 --> 02:22:11,553
this is the key of underground cell.
Go and open it.

1875
02:22:33,124 --> 02:22:33,920
my lord.

1876
02:22:35,315 --> 02:22:37,367
ho! God saved us.

1877
02:22:40,425 --> 02:22:42,080
what happened above?

1878
02:22:42,947 --> 02:22:47,486
it was a fight. uncle and sons
in-law and gundas, on the one side.

1879
02:22:47,511 --> 02:22:52,025
Ananthan Namboodiri and Sankunni
nair, on the other side. lt was a

1880
02:22:52,050 --> 02:22:56,588
furious fight. don't know who all
are fallen down hurt. No idea if

1881
02:22:56,613 --> 02:23:01,286
there is any casualty. frankly
speaking, l thought you are finished.

1882
02:23:02,045 --> 02:23:07,080
when l was overpowered and put here,
l thought he was going to kill me.

1883
02:23:07,514 --> 02:23:10,744
now l realize that it was to save me.

1884
02:23:11,110 --> 02:23:12,434
who might have done this?

1885
02:23:12,558 --> 02:23:15,291
Ananthan. No, Abdulla

1886
02:23:15,591 --> 02:23:16,379
what? Abdulla?

1887
02:23:16,682 --> 02:23:19,357
yes. Both are the same person.

1888
02:23:36,054 --> 02:23:38,321
l don't feel like leaving
without, meeting you.

1889
02:23:40,373 --> 02:23:43,087
l know that l have done unpardonable sins.

1890
02:23:43,814 --> 02:23:46,990
l don't know how to expiate for this.

1891
02:23:49,413 --> 02:23:55,875
this palace,
harem and above all your great mind were

1892
02:23:56,466 --> 02:23:58,541
disgraced by this unworthy man

1893
02:24:04,162 --> 02:24:04,898
you can curse me

1894
02:24:06,158 --> 02:24:10,456
l jumped into this adventure because,
l was badly in need of money.

1895
02:24:13,927 --> 02:24:20,707
l own only the address of my dad,
who died when l was a small kid.

1896
02:24:22,055 --> 02:24:26,361
it was my dad's house, his
musical instruments, my

1897
02:24:26,386 --> 02:24:30,521
mom's never ending tears
that, made me a singer.

1898
02:24:31,739 --> 02:24:34,664
but,
l didn't reach anywhere.

1899
02:24:36,882 --> 02:24:42,823
even when we were drowning, in huge
debts, My mom told me not to give up,

1900
02:24:42,848 --> 02:24:48,523
this house, Dad used to sing here.
these walls know dad's voice. Dad's

1901
02:24:48,548 --> 02:24:54,247
fingers ran through the strings, of
this sitar and veena. but poor mom

1902
02:24:54,272 --> 02:24:59,971
my mother could not die in the floor,
of the house where father lived.

1903
02:25:02,503 --> 02:25:07,204
l was ready to do anything to regain
my, house by repaying the debts.

1904
02:25:08,518 --> 02:25:14,493
even Amirkhan sahib had the, privilege
to sleep in king Udayavarma's bedroom,

1905
02:25:14,518 --> 02:25:20,351
he left behind only debts. now it is clear
that such a man's, son cannot harm you.

1906
02:25:21,476 --> 02:25:25,241
if l could do so, that father's
son couldn't have faced,

1907
02:25:25,266 --> 02:25:28,568
the plight to sing in the,
red streets of Bombay.

1908
02:25:31,210 --> 02:25:36,505
my lord, please pardon me
for all the mistakes l have

1909
02:25:36,530 --> 02:25:42,021
committed, considering me as
the son of your old friend

1910
02:26:07,148 --> 02:26:08,011
Anantha

1911
02:26:18,902 --> 02:26:22,895
l have pardoned to the son of,
Amirkhan Sahib

1912
02:26:23,553 --> 02:26:29,349
but in whose name will you beg for pardon..
to an abnormal mother?

1913
02:26:30,498 --> 02:26:32,678
what justification do
you have to say, to my

1914
02:26:32,703 --> 02:26:34,883
daughter who don't even,
know to cry loudly.

1915
02:26:35,885 --> 02:26:38,301
Unni, Unni,

1916
02:26:39,030 --> 02:26:40,241
where is Unni?

1917
02:26:40,667 --> 02:26:41,931
where is my Unni?

1918
02:26:42,636 --> 02:26:44,279
Radha, call Unni?

1919
02:26:45,073 --> 02:26:48,726
Unni come Unni,

1920
02:26:56,219 --> 02:27:00,219
like the story of Krishna,
who forgot bereaved

1921
02:27:00,244 --> 02:27:04,157
Radha when leaving, for
Mathura from Gokulam.

1922
02:27:09,627 --> 02:27:10,553
my lord,

1923
02:27:11,836 --> 02:27:15,089
if l was not a vulgar and poor Abdulla

1924
02:27:15,333 --> 02:27:21,338
hmm. now all the vulgar people are out.
just wearing a sacred

1925
02:27:21,363 --> 02:27:26,883
thread, is nothing. Brahman
means the one who knows God.

1926
02:27:27,333 --> 02:27:28,570
Music is God

1927
02:27:29,518 --> 02:27:31,730
you are a man who knows music.

1928
02:27:41,134 --> 02:27:47,831
l am giving this palace and all my,
properties in the name of Radha.

1929
02:27:49,915 --> 02:27:52,807
if you are still ready
to respond to, being

1930
02:27:52,832 --> 02:27:56,051
addressed Unni, can't you
please don't leave us?

1931
02:28:02,762 --> 02:28:07,049
joy. the eternal joy,
Universal joy, that is music.

1932
02:28:24,967 --> 02:28:29,158
joy. the eternal joy,
Universal joy, that is music.

1933
02:28:29,484 --> 02:28:33,667
joy. the eternal joy,
Universal joy, that is music.

1934
02:28:35,366 --> 02:28:38,943
music

1935
02:28:39,950 --> 02:28:45,418
