1
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,600
Greetings Mr.Minister.

2
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,080
Greetings Mr.Jaswant.

3
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:58,400
I've completed the research on finding
the Plutonium Mines in India.

4
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,280
Very Good!

5
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,360
No one else to get their
hands on this information.

6
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,360
So this has to be handed
to the President directly.

7
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,320
Definitely!

8
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,800
There's a small party at home.

9
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,360
Once it's over, I'll come and see
you with details on a hard disk.

10
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,760
You're always welcome.

11
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,880
Thank you.

12
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,440
Sir, Minister is on the line...

13
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,680
This is Kishore

14
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,280
Mr.Kishore, how are you?

15
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,520
I'm doing good.

16
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,240
That Jaswant Malhotra...

17
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,840
...have completed the research.

18
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,040
I'm aware of it.

19
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,080
That fool...

20
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,440
...is stubborn on handing
it only to high command.

21
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,920
Doesn't really matter

22
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,640
we'll send him too up above.

23
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,720
Then let's take
the hard disk from him.

24
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,880
My man is on his way there.

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,160
Hey, call him now.

26
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,600
Hello Mr.Kishore.

27
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,800
Where are you?

28
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,040
I'm on my way to Scientist
Jaswant Malhotra's party.

29
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,000
Once it's done, I'll
call you myself.

30
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,280
Check him.

31
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,680
Check him.

32
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,440
Stop, Stop, Stop, Stop...

33
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,680
That's Amar Bondoro.

34
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,280
7 YEARS LATER...
CHENNAI

35
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,200
BOSS!

36
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,680
Hello!

37
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,760
Hello!

38
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,440
Boss, this is Rocky speaking.

39
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,360
Tell me.

40
00:04:54,546 --> 00:04:55,360
Excuse me!

41
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,760
You shouldn't make calls here.

42
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,840
I didn't make a call.

43
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,560
I got a call...

44
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,280
...even if you get a call,
you're not suppose to talk here.

45
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,920
- I shouldn't speak?
- That's right.

46
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,920
- Then you speak up.
- Ahhh.

47
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,280
It's an urgent Matt...

48
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,800
Boss, it's urgent matter.

49
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,800
Velayudham, who sold
his land to us,

50
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,400
is not ready to vacate that land and
is holding a court order with him.

51
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,160
Hey, I'm at the school.

52
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,880
Boss, why have you joined
a school at your age?

53
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,240
Hey, I'm at my son's school.

54
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,800
Oh, your son.

55
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,680
Oh no, wondering what to do now?

56
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,080
He's another...

57
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,520
Then get them here,
I'll whack them.

58
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,560
Boss, will someone come knowing
that they're going to get whacked?

59
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,480
That's right, will a goat volunteer
to get chopped by a butcher.

60
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,560
Then do one thing...

61
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,280
You did say he's got
a court order with him.

62
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,440
Snatch that and
come running here,

63
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,800
they'll come chasing behind you.

64
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,560
I'll take care of them.

65
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,360
Awesome!

66
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,040
Stop, what do you want?

67
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,800
Sir, ask them to show that court order.
I want to have a look.

68
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,480
Show that to him.

69
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,880
I did earlier.

70
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,080
They've already seen it.

71
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,040
Sir we did, but I didn't
have my glasses on.

72
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,320
So couldn't read.

73
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,520
Then what now?

74
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,600
I don't have my undies on.

75
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,160
What!?

76
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,080
I still don't have my glasses on,
that's why I need to cross check.

77
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,360
He's right, show that to him.

78
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,680
Hey, hey catch him.

79
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,560
He's getting away, catch him.

80
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,080
Catch him
Don't let go of him

81
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,040
What's with them shouting
"Haa- Hoo" all the time?

82
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,720
Are you teaching them to
fight or how to scream?

83
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,920
Even in their sleep,
they're "Haa- Hoo"...

84
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,920
Here after, it's not "Haa- Hoo"
they should be learning,

85
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,200
it should be the real fight.

86
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,960
Then why don't you teach them?

87
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,640
Me!?

88
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,600
BOSS!

89
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,040
BOSS!

90
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,240
BOSS!

91
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,720
BOSS!

92
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,560
I've got them here,
just like you've asked.

93
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,800
Now start your thing.

94
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,400
Boss Jr. greetings.

95
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,560
I'm going to...

96
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,840
Boys and Girls, shall
we start the lesson?

97
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,120
Hey come on!

98
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,000
If someone charges
towards you to hit,

99
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,960
the first blow should
be from our side.

100
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,280
The first blow...

101
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,960
...should be from our side.

102
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,240
Shall we whack
the hell out of them?

103
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,600
Yes, we are ready

104
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,960
Beautiful!

105
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,640
Kick!

106
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,080
How's that possible?

107
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,880
So that's what happening.

108
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,960
Beautiful

109
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,120
Kick him

110
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,200
Who's this Hero?

111
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,640
Hero!?

112
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,680
That's my Dad.

113
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,000
Really!

114
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,160
Awesome.

115
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,400
You will be dead- meat

116
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,960
Knife!

117
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,200
- What?
- Don't hit

118
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,920
How is it?

119
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,080
Give me your hand.

120
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,120
Take this.

121
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,120
Let go of me

122
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,560
Make a fist and punch
him like this.

123
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,120
Shouldn't fly and
kick like this...

124
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,000
Shouldn't put him down
and twist his leg...

125
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,240
"Baskar...he is the rascal"

126
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,400
"Baskar...he is the rascal"

127
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,240
Shouldn't pull...

128
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,880
...and throw him in the air

129
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,440
Thank you...Thank you!

130
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,880
Dad, why did you get
them here to fight?

131
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,320
Hey, how do you expect me to
finish them without a fight.

132
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,920
Atrocious, doing Yoga
in a Karate class.

133
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,440
- Give me that dear.
- What's happening here?

134
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,040
All students get
to your classes.

135
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,920
Akash!

136
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,760
Don't leave after your practice.

137
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,280
Introduce me to your dad, ok?

138
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,720
Now this!

139
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,600
Akash.

140
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,280
Ask your dad to wait outside.

141
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,520
I'm scared quite
myself looking at him.

142
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,720
Come on Dad, let's go home.

143
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,600
Home!?

144
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,920
Go to you Karate classes.

145
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,560
Should I learn Karate from
the master or from you?

146
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,240
Doesn't matter who
you learn from.

147
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,320
You're my son.

148
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,880
You should learn everything right
from Karate till sword fight.

149
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,640
If so then don't come
in to my class anymore.

150
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,640
Just wait outside.

151
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,160
I'll get bored out here.

152
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,720
Can't even use the phone.

153
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,960
It's a crime if you
make or receive a call.

154
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,680
Then take this

155
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,080
keep playing this game.

156
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,240
Hold this.

157
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,040
What type of game is this?
It's all zig- zag.

158
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,680
You have to put these three
balls in the center pit.

159
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,880
If I do, do I win?

160
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,120
You won't be able to,
by then I'll be back.

161
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,920
Where do you have such patience.

162
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,640
Shivani, your Mom is calling.

163
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,760
- Hello.
- Hi, Shivani.

164
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,880
Are you done with training?

165
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,440
Not yet, will be done soon.

166
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,200
Ok, I'll be in the waiting area,
get there once you're done.

167
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,760
- Ok Mom.
- Ok.

168
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,280
Come, Come, Come.

169
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,440
Stop!

170
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,480
Stop!

171
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,280
I said stop there

172
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,840
Sorry.

173
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,720
Game!

174
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,680
Don't move away...

175
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,400
Don't move away...

176
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,760
Excuse me!

177
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,160
Oh!

178
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,360
Hey I'm at the school
I'll call you later, bye.

179
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,520
Game it seems...

180
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,920
...does it matter
if the balls are in or out?

181
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,920
It's urgent.

182
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,320
Just one call, please.

183
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,840
I'm going to squeeze
the life out of you.

184
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,160
We're used to attend
calls with knife.

185
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,840
Arnold!

186
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,680
Tell me boss.

187
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,560
Where are you?

188
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,680
I'm making juice.

189
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,640
Juice uh!?

190
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,360
Boss...

191
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,920
...shall I kidnap his kidney
or make liquid his liver?

192
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,400
Hey, he might die.

193
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,280
I've just broken
his arms and legs.

194
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,760
Then how will he sign it?

195
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,440
Don't worry, I broke
his left hand.

196
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,280
We still have his right
hand for signature.

197
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,960
Oh, Ok...Ok.

198
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,040
- Don't call yourself a lawyer.
- Sir!?

199
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,120
Don't you know to get a stay
order before someone does?

200
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,840
A lawyer should know
either the law or a judge.

201
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,200
You don't know either.

202
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,680
Then how come this mess?

203
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,280
- Sir, please listen...
- You're useless.

204
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,080
You send all
the case files home.

205
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,160
Hello!

206
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:09,880
Hello.

207
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,920
You said just one call, but
now it's the third one.

208
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,000
Three calls, but it's
about the same issue.

209
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,360
Regardless of the issue,
enough of calling.

210
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,920
It's vacation right!?

211
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,160
One guy got a stay order,
and Arnold beat him up.

212
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,040
He's in hospital, it's
a serious matter.

213
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,600
Hello.

214
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,520
I don't care about all
this, give me the phone.

215
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,840
- Boss...
- Arnold!

216
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,840
Arnold is on the line
Just a minute.

217
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,840
Hello Arnold, that advocate
will send the files home...

218
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,840
...excuse me!

219
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,120
Give that phone
to me right away,

220
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,600
don't you have any manners?

221
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,840
Are you going to give
that phone or not?

222
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,000
What's your problem?

223
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,880
You want this phone?

224
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,800
Yes!

225
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,880
Take it!

226
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,080
Why did you break it?

227
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,760
Do you know how
expensive is this?

228
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,960
Why do you care how
expensive it is?

229
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,120
Your concern is manners right?

230
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,080
Now pick up your
manners and leave.

231
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,400
Rascal!

232
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,800
"Baskar...he is the rascal"

233
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,640
"Baskar...he is the rascal"

234
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,560
"Baskar...he is the rascal"

235
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,760
"Baskar...he is the rascal"

236
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,480
What happened Mom?

237
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,320
A rascal broke my phone.

238
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,080
Did you just let him go?

239
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,120
You should've broken his teeth.

240
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,360
I'm going to...

241
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,560
Hey, Shivani...

242
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,800
Mom!

243
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,520
Isn't this your phone?

244
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,560
Yes.

245
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,960
Then, this must be his phone.

246
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,160
Oh no, what's wrong
with your mom?

247
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,640
They keep nagging you in this
school, if you're on the phone.

248
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,760
That's him.

249
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,320
Oh him!

250
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,120
He's my friend Akash's dad.

251
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,000
He's a big hero, mom.

252
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,720
Hello.

253
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,640
Hey Akash, why did you leave?

254
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,880
Didn't ask you to
introduce your dad to me?

255
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,120
You get your dad and
come to the food court.

256
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,840
I'll come there with my mom too.

257
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,000
Dad!?

258
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,680
Why?

259
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,640
Who's that?

260
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,760
Just a minute.

261
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,120
Dad...

262
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,760
...when someone is on the phone
you shouldn't ask about the details.

263
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,480
That's not a good manners.

264
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,880
Shivani...

265
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,560
...my dad is in a bad mood.

266
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,400
I'll call you later, bye.

267
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,080
He's a big hero...

268
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,160
...and you've spoiled his mood.

269
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,720
Sorry.

270
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,720
Don't apologize to me,

271
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,040
instead get a new phone, then
go and apologize to him.

272
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,080
Ok.

273
00:15:55,232 --> 00:16:00,192
"Why were you born my son...
why were you born"

274
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:06,240
"Why were you born my son...
why were you born"

275
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,680
Dad...

276
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,120
...are you angry?

277
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,520
Nope.

278
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,040
I know you're angry.

279
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,200
But it's ok.

280
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,320
If I don't say this now...

281
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,600
...you'll repeat
the same another time.

282
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,400
Then what would
they think of you?

283
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,600
What will they think?

284
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,520
Will think of you
as a manner less person.

285
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,720
- Manners uh?
- That's right.

286
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,040
Even when I had to
switch off this song,

287
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,120
first I did ask your
permission for that.

288
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,520
That's what manners is.

289
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,600
I thought manners was only
pertaining to phones.

290
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,360
Now even Radio demands manners.

291
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,600
Manners is being
splurged everywhere.

292
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,400
Do you have any issues
with me playing a song?

293
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,400
"I'm a Fool"

294
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,680
"I'm a Fool"

295
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,040
"It was mentioned by four
well educated persons."

296
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,480
They don't what to play
on radio these days.

297
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,360
First they should be
taught about manners.

298
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,400
Hello.

299
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,400
Boss, Velayudham have
signed the documents.

300
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,640
Shall I break his
other hand too?

301
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,000
Let it go, he has signed it.

302
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,480
Boss, what if he does the same
with our opponent too?

303
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,640
That's the reason thinking of
breaking the other hand too.

304
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,000
'Cause it's said, not to
come home empty handed.

305
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,040
Ok...Ok, then break it.

306
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,040
Hey, I'm a little
busy will talk later.

307
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,120
What kind of busy?

308
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,840
You're breaking someone's
hand, 'cause he didn't sign.

309
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,200
And here I'm signing
until my hand falls off.

310
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,160
I've told you
a thousand times...

311
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,000
...why don't you take
over these companies...

312
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,520
...and sign these cheques.

313
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,840
The bank keeps rejecting the cheques as
my signature doesn't match.

314
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,720
This is not my cup of tea.

315
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,440
- Hey!
- Boss are you busy?

316
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,960
Didn't I say? That
will call you back.

317
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,240
Who's on the phone?

318
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,320
Boss...

319
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,720
- Wait,
- Ok.

320
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,320
- Dad!
- Hmmm.

321
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,120
When someone is on the phone,
shouldn't ask details about it.

322
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,960
Don't you have any manners?

323
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,920
What's the use of you
studying in London.

324
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,240
Looking at fathers,
the sons learn too.

325
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,720
It was said by
a great personality.

326
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,320
Hey tell me.

327
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,400
Great Personality!?

328
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,400
It wasn't a Great Personality,grandpa

329
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,960
it was his son, I said that.

330
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,240
No wonder.

331
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,120
I was a little happy thinking,
my son became wiser.

332
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,760
I was talking to Shivani
over the phone,

333
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,400
that's when he asked who it was?

334
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,440
The lecture I gave him on
that, rebounded on you.

335
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,000
Very Good dear.

336
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,880
Good that you started
teaching you father.

337
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,560
That's why...

338
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,400
...I asked him to let go of work and
be with you the entire vacation.

339
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,840
Only then you both will...

340
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,080
...have an understanding!?

341
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,800
Why did you do that grandpa?
You don't like seeing me happy.

342
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,040
Why dear?

343
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,840
Why did you have
a child like this?

344
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,800
What's wrong with my son?

345
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,040
He's a King!

346
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,240
Do you know, what your King did
in front of our Principal?

347
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,480
What did he do?

348
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,560
Because of your Son, our
school has got a great name.

349
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:16,040
He's been selected
as the 'Best Student' at National Level.

350
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,560
The award ceremony will
be held at Pondicherry.

351
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,880
Akash, I'm very proud of you.

352
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,160
Thank you Sir.

353
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,400
That's fine...

354
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,400
For Vacation classes,

355
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,720
what have you chosen?

356
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,960
- Music.
- Karate.

357
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,720
- Music.
- Karate.

358
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,480
I'm not interested in Karate,
just the music class, Dad.

359
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,200
No issues, join
both the classes.

360
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,680
You can sing and fight,
and fight singing.

361
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,080
- What do you say sir?
- Yes.

362
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,800
What's the fee for
both the classes?

363
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,560
- It's Rs.60,000/- only, Sir.
- That's it.

364
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Pay up.

365
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,160
Oh God...no!

366
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,000
He just embarrassed me.

367
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,520
Did everyone at the school
got a peek of his underwear?

368
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,240
- He didn't stop there.
- Ahhh!

369
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,960
All the guys at the school,

370
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,200
were asking if I wear
the same kind of underwear?

371
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,320
They pull down my
pants to see it.

372
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,120
Oh dear God, he
embarrassed you too.

373
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,680
Do you know what
happened at the Bakery?

374
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,880
What happened there?

375
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,880
Get me a packet of mixture.

376
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,000
- Didn't grandpa come with you?
- No he didn't.

377
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,920
Who's this? Is he
your new driver?

378
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,360
Sir, Sir don't beat me up.

379
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,760
How can you not make
out who the father is?

380
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,920
Sir, Sir stop it.

381
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,760
You don't look
like a shopkeeper.

382
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,880
You look like a thief,
did I mention anything?

383
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,680
Hey let go of him

384
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,920
why are you hitting us?

385
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,240
You don't realize who
you're messing with.

386
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,560
Driver it seems...

387
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,200
No wonder...

388
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,400
...there were bills for
repair of an auto and a shop.

389
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,200
It wasn't the bills,

390
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,040
it were your dad's doings.

391
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,720
Correct, that's his job.

392
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,920
Exactly the other day, Rocky
uncle got rowdies to the school,

393
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,120
dad joined too,

394
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,280
in fighting and bashing...

395
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,320
Hey, he's coming...

396
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,440
I can't come there.

397
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,040
My son is getting an award, and I
have to be in Pondicherry for that.

398
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,280
Grandpa.

399
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,080
Why is dad coming
to Pondicherry?

400
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,560
Oh no, the ruckus he'll
create in Pondicherry,

401
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,200
will even dissolve
the parliament.

402
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,600
Dear, that Chief
Minister is my friend.

403
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,640
- Oh no.
- Grandpa.

404
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,960
I feel embarrassed
to go with him.

405
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,120
He'll come and embarrass
me out there too.

406
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,320
I won't go with him.

407
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,640
Pondicherry is right here,

408
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,200
I've asked driver
Devdas to come.

409
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,040
He'll take him safely
for the ceremony.

410
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,080
My son is going to get an award.

411
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,120
I should be the one
present there.

412
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,840
Not a driver or a gardener.

413
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,960
You did say,

414
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,880
to be with Akash
throughout the vacation.

415
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,000
Only then he'll have
affection towards me.

416
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,600
How do you expect
the affection to happen?

417
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,720
How will it happen?

418
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,080
I asked you to do
what he desires.

419
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,160
But you...

420
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,240
...are forcing things
you like on him.

421
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,480
Didn't he want to
join the music class?

422
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,800
Why did you push him
into Karate classes?

423
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,880
Do you want him to be
a menace like you?

424
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,320
I'll tell you something
don't take me wrong.

425
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,640
Akash is embarrassed to
even call you his father.

426
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,400
Stop it, right there.

427
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,840
Ssshhh!

428
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,120
From which tyre the air is leaking?

429
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,400
Is the tire flat?

430
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,520
Ssshhh!

431
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,440
What's with Ssshhh!?

432
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,640
Why are you late?

433
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,280
You're late, haven't
you left for home yet?

434
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,440
How do you expect me to go?

435
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,840
You said will come at 10pm
and have arrived now.

436
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,840
It's not yet 10,
It's just 3:30 now.

437
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,760
Hey you said at
10pm in the night.

438
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,440
Now it's 3am, early
in the morning.

439
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,120
- Hey Rakkapa!
- Yes Boss.

440
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,240
Why there's so much noise?

441
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:15,920
It's you...

442
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,000
No I meant, Devdas is here Boss.

443
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,000
Hey what's that in your hand?

444
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,000
That's...

445
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,240
...my sister Kalyani.

446
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,000
Boss had asked to get it.

447
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,200
- 'cause he was sad.
- Ok, that's fine...

448
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,920
- Boss!?
- Pay up the auto.

449
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,200
- Devdas!
- Yes.

450
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,400
Wash the vehicle.

451
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,360
Ok Boss.

452
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,320
Thank God he left...

453
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,960
Hey, why should I
wash his vehicle?

454
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,880
You drunkard.

455
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,400
Boss asked to clean
the car not the auto.

456
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,880
They're leaving to
Pondicherry in the morning.

457
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,880
Pondicherry!?

458
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,560
I just got back from there,

459
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,000
if I'd knew would've
stayed back.

460
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,600
I can't make him understand.

461
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,920
Take this.

462
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,240
Hundred Rupees!?

463
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:50,760
Show me...

464
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,720
...that's right it's
hundred rupees.

465
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,280
- What about the rest?
- Keep the change.

466
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,960
You have to pay the rest,
the fare is six thousand rupees.

467
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,480
What!? Six Thousand!?

468
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,680
Did you happen to
buy off his auto?

469
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,880
Hey, no one will buy his auto,
even for free. Why would I?

470
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,280
Why are you charging so much
from bus stand to here?

471
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,640
He didn't hire
the auto from bus stand

472
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,560
but he hired the auto
from Pondicherry.

473
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,560
What Pond...

474
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,400
...would someone come all
the way from Pondy in auto?

475
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,400
I did.

476
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,400
Just 'cause your name is Devdas

477
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,640
you'll be drunk 24/7?

478
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,720
Hey, it's only wrong if your
name is Gandhi and you're drunk.

479
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,840
It's a sin, if you don't drink
with a name like Devdas.

480
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,360
If you keep at it,
you'll die soon.

481
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,600
Hey, let me get to you now.

482
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,960
Ok, even if you had come all the way
why is it six thousand rupees?

483
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,720
It's only Three Thousand to come
from Pondicherry till here,

484
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,360
but the auto has
to return right!?

485
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,200
For that another three thousand.

486
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,720
Ok, it's six thousand right?

487
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,760
Here take it.

488
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,600
I'll come with you
to Pondicherry too.

489
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,360
Why are you going
to Pondicherry?

490
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,800
Hey, the auto is
returning empty.

491
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,200
I don't want to
waste boss's money.

492
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,600
I'll come with you too, move.

493
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,440
- Hey!
- Boss...

494
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,920
What's taking you so long?

495
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,640
I'll be right here boss.

496
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,720
- Hey security.
- Tell me sir.

497
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,440
You go with him and get
down at Pondicherry.

498
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,400
Why so?

499
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,160
- Auto is returning empty.
- Yeah!

500
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,000
I won't let anyone
waste boss's money.

501
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,280
- I will never...
- Ok, Ok.

502
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,120
You go with him.

503
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,320
Then what about my return?

504
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,360
Take the same auto and get back.

505
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,640
Fill up soon, they might
hike the fuel prices.

506
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,720
- How much did they hike today?
- shouldn't ask.

507
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,320
Hello!

508
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,720
Akash have you left?

509
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,880
Yeah, I've left.

510
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,840
Devdas uncle is
filling up diesel.

511
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,360
Didn't you go with your dad?

512
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,440
Didn't I ask you to
go with your dad?

513
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,280
I'm going with dad.

514
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:29,320
In spite of you hurting him,
he agreed to come with you.

515
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,040
He's really great.

516
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,320
Who's so great?

517
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,400
Who broke his phone
'cause of you.

518
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,200
I did buy him a new phone,

519
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,320
will give it to him.

520
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,560
- Hello.
- Eat...

521
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,600
Ok, I'll call you later.

522
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,600
Boss, give me the keys
I'll drive.

523
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,440
Hey, you're stinking
of booze, move away.

524
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,800
That's nothing boss...

525
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,000
...I put pepper in brandy
'cause I had fever.

526
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,360
Brandy for fever?

527
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,280
That's right boss.

528
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,800
If you have fever, put
pepper in brandy.

529
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,800
Move away and sit

530
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,600
Tell me Rocky.

531
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,600
Boss, that Mudichur Selvam

532
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,880
had promised to sell his
land, and refusing to now.

533
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,880
When asked, said that his
brothers are not agreeing to it.

534
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,880
How's that brothers drop in
when the land is up for sale?

535
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,520
That we'll have to
check with his father.

536
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,920
Crackhead!

537
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,040
Boss!

538
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:15,960
I don't care,

539
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,280
if you come down for 10
minutes it'll be solved.

540
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,720
Dad!

541
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,880
- You idiot!
- Did you call me boss?

542
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,560
Didn't I tell you that I'm
heading to Pondy with Akash.

543
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,160
Boss, if you don't make it,
then we'll lose the advance.

544
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,400
Just drop in for 5
minutes, it's on the way.

545
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,000
Boss!

546
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,640
Why don't you go to the spot,

547
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,360
I'll drive Akash to Mumbai.

548
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,320
Mumbai!?

549
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,960
It's Pondicherry you idiot it!

550
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,880
Now I'm clear about it.

551
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,040
Hello.

552
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,880
Akash, have you guys reached?

553
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,920
Nope, we haven't
crossed Chennai yet.

554
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,640
Why!?

555
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,040
Dad had to tend
to a small business deal.

556
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,800
What kind of business
deal happens on the way?

557
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,720
What else do you think? Fights!

558
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,360
That's his core business.

559
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,200
He said will be
back in 5 minutes,

560
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,000
but it's two hours now.

561
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,080
The business has started now,

562
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,226
he'll be done in 5 minutes.

563
00:27:12,264 --> 00:27:13,608
"They will be sent to the coffin"

564
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,880
"Here is the Baskar"

565
00:27:14,927 --> 00:27:17,807
"The crackers will blast up
Rascal is here now"

566
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,520
"He will make them
swing on the air, for sure"

567
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,080
Brother, he's the reason
behind all this.

568
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,960
I wasn't aware of
my father's illegal child.

569
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,520
He just dropped out of nowhere and
is not letting me sell this land.

570
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,200
Hey, who are you calling
an illegal child?

571
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,160
My mother and your father
were in serious relationship.

572
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,280
It was your mother who
dragged him away.

573
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,840
- Hey!
- Hey!

574
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,560
I don't care who was lurking...

575
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,080
...sign on that paper.

576
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,360
"Baskar...he is the Rascal"

577
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,560
"Baskar...he is the Rascal"

578
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,040
Hey Das!

579
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,760
Oh, we've reached Pondicherry.

580
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,320
You're really fast boss.

581
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,440
Dad, you don't have to change.

582
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,640
We're two hours behind.

583
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,360
Hey, don't worry
we'll be on time.

584
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,480
If that's the case, we'll
have to fly in helicopter.

585
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,040
- Hey Rocky!
- Yes boss.

586
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,720
- Did you call me?
- Make arrangements for a Helicopter.

587
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,840
Is it for spraying medicine?

588
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,760
Hey, it's for Boss Jr.
to play with.

589
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,000
There must be a toy
store somewhere,

590
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,480
get a small one
and play with it.

591
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,920
- Buffalo
- I'm going to...

592
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,920
Idiots!

593
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,760
Find an empty ground for
the chopper to land,

594
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,360
have to get to
Pondicherry sooner.

595
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,800
Oh so we're not in
Pondicherry then?

596
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,160
Nope it's Velachery.

597
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,360
Move!

598
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:29,840
Boss,

599
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,320
why don't buy a helicopter.

600
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,960
I'll be the driver for that too.

601
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,120
It's Pilot Das uncle not driver.

602
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,040
Hello.

603
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,920
Has the event started?

604
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,280
I would only know, If I'm there.

605
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,800
We haven't crossed even ECR yet.

606
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,200
You're already late.

607
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,280
You'll have to fly
to make it on time.

608
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,360
We're going to fly.

609
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,760
That's why Dad has asked
for a Helicopter.

610
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,440
Helicopter uh?

611
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,880
Really!?

612
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,600
Boss, the helicopter is here.

613
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,360
Yeah, Arnold uncle is
here with the Helicopter.

614
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,960
I'll call you later.

615
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:10,600
Mom, Akash's dad is taking
him on a helicopter.

616
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,440
Such a lucky boy, right?

617
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,720
Such a lucky boy, right?
[Mocks Shivani]

618
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,480
Who knows, his dad might
even take him on a rocket.

619
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,000
Hey Arnold!

620
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,560
Boss and I are
waiting down here.

621
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,800
Can you see us?

622
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,920
Arnold uncle.

623
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,560
Who's calling and troubling now.

624
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,440
Boss, it's Arnold who's calling.

625
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,960
- Hello.
- Tell me Das.

626
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,280
- Hey Arnold, Arnold!
- Yeah tell me...

627
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,240
Land the helicopter here.

628
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,000
- Hey Arnold land it here.
- I'm coming wait...

629
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:35,800
Oh God!

630
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,760
Switch off that fan
on top and speak.

631
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,720
You have to land here.

632
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,680
Where are you going?

633
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,520
Left us behind, and is heading
to Pondicherry all by himself.

634
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,480
- Hey
- Hey Arnold.

635
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,520
- Come this side...
- I'm coming there...

636
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:49,240
No you're headed
elsewhere, come this side.

637
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,360
Hey Arnold!

638
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,520
- Oh god!
- Hey...Hey!

639
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,400
- You're going elsewhere
- Hey move.

640
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,680
Hey why did you
get this vehicle?

641
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,000
Even that's a good idea.

642
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:03,720
You're right boss.

643
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,760
Boss, he got a mortuary van
instead of an helicopter.

644
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,120
Hey this is a mortuary van,

645
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,680
I should've got
a tri- cycle for you.

646
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,160
This is an apt vehicle, which
will work in this emergency.

647
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,880
There will be no issues with traffic,
nor one way, nor the police.

648
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,480
Just get in and stop talking.

649
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,720
- Ok boss.
- Come on, Das.

650
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,960
Dad I'll ride in the back.

651
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,200
- Ok go.
- Hmmm.

652
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,680
Hello.

653
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,080
Did you get on to
the helicopter?

654
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,520
Yeah right, we all
are flying high.

655
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,760
Who all?

656
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,600
Me

657
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,960
Arnold a.k.a Angusami.

658
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,640
Das a.k.a Devdas.

659
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,440
Ok, there will be no network
on helicopter right?

660
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,600
If so, are you still on ground?

661
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,400
We're still on the ground, but
someone has gone underground.

662
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,400
Ok Shivani, I'll call you later.

663
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,000
Ma'am.

664
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,040
It's seen...

665
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,040
Doesn't seem like she
just lost her husband.

666
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,960
I was talking about
him, cover his face.

667
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,000
Ok, how did he die?

668
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,880
He swallowed a Sim Card.

669
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,200
Then?

670
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,200
Following that he also swallowed
the Adhaar Card fearing the Govt.

671
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,480
That's correct.

672
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,280
Why did he swallow
the Adhaar Card?

673
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,400
Hey, now it's mandatory to
link Adhaar everywhere.

674
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,720
Who is she trying to call, doesn't
seem like lost her husband.

675
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,280
Who are you trying to call?

676
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,320
The mobile network company.

677
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,480
Why so?

678
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,960
He swallowed the sim card right?

679
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,720
Have to cancel that.

680
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,520
If not will receive
a bill every month.

681
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,560
She's right.

682
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,240
You idiot, what
did you marry into?

683
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,920
Hey, who's that?

684
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:01,960
Hi!

685
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,920
Welcome Miss Kalyani.

686
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,400
Oh thank you.

687
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,360
Who's that?

688
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,720
Priyanka Chopra!

689
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,320
No, I meant Priyanka Chopra.

690
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,640
She's not Priyanka Chopra.

691
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,400
I meant she's also
a Bollywood actress like her.

692
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,720
Boss, actress it seems let's
get in the front and look.

693
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,560
- Yes let's go.
- Come on.

694
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,640
Move aside boss, don't cover me.

695
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,880
- Ma'am one question.
- Ma'am just a minute.

696
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,920
Miss Kalyani, is the viral news
true about your love affair?

697
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,200
That's true, I'm in
love with someone.

698
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,120
Is he from the Film
Industry as well?

699
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,240
No, he's a businessman.

700
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,040
A widower and has got a child.

701
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,800
Move aside
Come this side

702
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,320
Hey, don't crush the child.

703
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,960
Guys give way please, give way.

704
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,280
Don't crush him.

705
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,040
Should climb up and get a peek.

706
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,320
We can't get through.

707
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,560
- Let's go through the car.
- Dad, it's their car.

708
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,560
That's fine, let's go.

709
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,600
It's a good idea.

710
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,360
Will you continue
acting after marriage?

711
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,320
Will your fiance agree to it?

712
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,800
He'll always have my back.

713
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,320
Just like she said,
he's right behind her.

714
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,920
Isn't he Baskar, the son of
business magnet M.A.M Rangasami?

715
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,800
Ma'am!

716
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,200
We'll get in together
once Sir is here.

717
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,680
Yeah ok.
Sir, Sir!

718
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,880
Sir, one minute.

719
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,320
Is it true that you and Kalyani
are in a relationship?

720
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,200
Kalyani!?

721
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,840
- They're talking about Kalyani beer.
- How do they know?

722
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,640
It's known to everyone,
don't be scared.

723
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,120
- I'm not scared.
- Then speak up.

724
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,240
It's true about the relationship.

725
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,600
How long is this going on?

726
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,720
I was asking, how long
has this been going on?

727
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,760
It's been long.

728
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,440
When did this all started?

729
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,320
That...

730
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,880
...it started when
my wife passed away.

731
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:45,240
When boss is sad, he'll come
to me asking for Kalyani.

732
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,440
No matter how late it is,

733
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,280
I'll make sure he gets it.

734
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,200
When is the marriage?

735
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,360
They're married already, why
do you keep stressing on that?

736
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,400
Leave, get lost from here.

737
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,440
Let's leave boss.

738
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,200
He's saying they're
already married.

739
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,080
Might be secret marriage

740
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,080
VIP Call, Sound!

741
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,600
Dad, stop.

742
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,560
Dad!

743
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,360
We shouldn't be on the stage,
have to sit down here.

744
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,120
No, No, you both have to be
seated next Ma'am on the stage.

745
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,120
Huh! Come on!

746
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,440
- Greetings, please...
- Thank you.

747
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,880
Hello, Hi!

748
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,360
Hi.

749
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,880
- What's your name?
- Akash.

750
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,760
Good Evening!

751
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,400
Greetings to one and all

752
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,040
To start this programme
we welcome...

753
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,200
- Can I take a selfie?
- Yes of course.

754
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:45,200
Ms.Kalyani is here, and we
extend a warm welcome to her.

755
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:50,400
Now the Inaugural address by
our chief guest Ms.Kalyani.

756
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,040
Good Evening everybody.

757
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,760
First thing I like to say,

758
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,520
it's a huge, huge, huge
pleasure for me to be here.

759
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:13,200
And distribute the prizes for
all the winning students...

760
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,000
-...this evening.
- Hello!

761
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,840
Hey, they're showing
you on the TV.

762
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,400
Really!?

763
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,600
I'm right now, next
to actress Kalyani.

764
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,560
I also took selfie with them.

765
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,080
Who is going to marry
actress Kalyani?

766
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,800
That question has
been answered now.

767
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,640
That is okay

768
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,480
The news states that your dad is
going to marry actress Kalyani.

769
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,720
Who told you this?

770
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,280
It's on the TV.

771
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,960
First take out your phone
and check the news.

772
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,800
Look,

773
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,480
your hero caught
hold of an heroine.

774
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,280
I pity that heroine.

775
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,720
Miss Kalyani, is the viral news
true about your love affair?

776
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,120
That's true, I'm in
love with someone.

777
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,680
Is it true that you and Kalyani
are in a relationship?

778
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,560
It's true about the relationship.

779
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,560
When did this all started?

780
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,680
When did you take
a video of this?

781
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,520
It's not a video, it's
the news from TV.

782
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,320
The one who is going to
marry actress Kalyani is,

783
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,040
...none other than Popular businessman
M.A.M Rangasami's son Baskar.

784
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,720
Actress Kalyani and Baskar
have confirmed on it.

785
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,720
Actress Kalyani and M.A.M
Rangasami's son Baskar

786
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,880
got secretly married and
Baskar confirmed on it.

787
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,280
It's so embarrassing.

788
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,520
Rangasami's Son, Rangasami's
son...Son of Rangasami!

789
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,120
My name is attached with it.

790
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,920
Shall we release a counter
news in the papers?

791
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,720
Saying what?

792
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,480
That businessman Baskar
is not Rangasami's son.

793
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,920
Hey, to do such a lewd thing,

794
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,480
you went with all these
monkeys to Pondicherry.

795
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,800
Pick the call.

796
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,120
Hello!

797
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,920
Hello, is Baskar sir there?

798
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,240
I'm actress Kalyani's
manager speaking.

799
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,040
Ma'am wants to speak
to Baskar sir.

800
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,280
Can't talk to him now.

801
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,880
Boss is busy in
getting an earful.

802
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,200
It's your matter
which is going on...

803
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,280
Who's on the phone?

804
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,920
Look here Boss,

805
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,000
you shouldn't ask about the details,
when someone is on the phone.

806
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,400
If you do, then it's
not a mannerism.

807
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,320
That's what Boss Jr. stated.

808
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:19,960
Hello.

809
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,240
Hello this is actress
Kalyani speaking.

810
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,200
Why did you spread
such a big lie?

811
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,160
And have earned me
a very bad name.

812
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,000
I'm not Baskar, It's
his father Rangasami.

813
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,960
That was...

814
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,160
...one

815
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,880
small misunderstanding.

816
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,800
There's a beer in your name.

817
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,960
My son did actually
speak about that.

818
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,640
But the media and
others have mistook it.

819
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,600
There's no use in
saying anything now.

820
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,800
My fiance...

821
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,440
...have mistook me.

822
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,320
And have called
off the marriage.

823
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,640
Don't worry dear...

824
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,840
Your marriage won't be called
off due to this issue.

825
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,720
It's my responsibility to
get you both married, fine?

826
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,520
Ok thank you sir.

827
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,520
That's how you make
a strong decision, boss.

828
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,400
Big Boss, is a genius.

829
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,920
Kalyani's family is
not a normal one.

830
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,360
Mom is a Muslim, Father is Punjabi
and the brother is Christian.

831
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,000
But Kalyani is pure Hindu.

832
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,600
The entire family is
an example of nationality.

833
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,280
A girl like that should be
the daughter-in-law for this house.

834
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,440
Hey, I'll smash
your face to pulp.

835
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,520
Beating them up can wait.

836
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,880
First meet the guy she was
supposed to get married,

837
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,040
beg of him,

838
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,120
and explain what exactly happened
and get them back together.

839
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,080
No matter where her lover
is, let's nab him...

840
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,000
First you break his bones
and then you go alone.

841
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,880
Baskar Sir, can we know the reason
for the sudden visit to Siddharth?

842
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,080
Baskar Sir, the love
between you and Kalyani,

843
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,760
is being disrupted by
her Ex-Love Siddharth,

844
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,960
you've come alone to see him, is
it to compromise or to threaten?

845
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,640
Siddharth and I will come
back and reply to this.

846
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,480
Baskar is meeting Siddharth in order
for him to let go off Kalyani.

847
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,920
Will Siddharth let go
off Kalyani or not?

848
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,840
Is Kalyani for Siddharth
or for Baskar?

849
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,680
We'll get an answer
on that quite soon.

850
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,080
- Excuse me Sir.
- Yeah.

851
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,520
Sir, there's someone called
Baskar has come to meet you.

852
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,320
- Tell him can't meet now.
- Ok, Sir.

853
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,440
Mr.Stephen.

854
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,960
Your performance has to be
contributed along with Alan's...

855
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,320
-...both of you have.
- Sorry.

856
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,520
- My name is Baskar.
- Hey you!

857
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,720
I didn't come for
myself, I came for you.

858
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,880
The beer I drink and
your lovers name...

859
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,200
-...they got mixed up.
- You don't have to say anything, get lost.

860
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,200
Siddharth Sir.

861
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,560
I said you get out.

862
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,960
Rascal!

863
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,000
Greetings!

864
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,000
Important News!

865
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,000
A new twist in actress
Kalyani's love affair.

866
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,560
He has solved it.

867
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,640
Her new lover Baskar, beat
him up at his own office.

868
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,520
Oh God no!

869
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,920
- Sir, Sir.
- Hey move aside...

870
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,680
If you lay hands on
me, will kill you.

871
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,520
I'll break that, will
break your camera.

872
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,800
Move that camera.

873
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,400
Siddharth is done for life.

874
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:54,480
Let's hear what our reporter Sriram
has to say from Siddharth's office.

875
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,640
Sriram, can you explain in
detail, what's happening there?

876
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,240
What's all this?

877
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,200
Just like how you
see in a cinema,

878
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,720
a fight is happening live here.

879
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,840
Siddharth who refused
to let go off Kalyani,

880
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:07,920
is being beaten up by
current lover Baskar....

881
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,280
For Kasif TV with
cameraman Ravanan

882
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,000
it's your Sriram.

883
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,480
I'm the only one, who haven't
got beaten up by him.

884
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,920
There must be a reason, if your
dad had beaten someone up.

885
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,480
You and your grandpa have
mistaken about your dad.

886
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,560
Hey Akash, is this your mom?

887
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,160
When is the wedding of your
father and your new mother?

888
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,800
If you really wish to know,
go and ask Akash's dad.

889
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,320
Akash, you leave.

890
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,400
Do you think you're Mary Kom?

891
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,760
- Hey where are you going?
- Hey let me go.

892
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,280
Take your hands off me.

893
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,440
What if I don't?

894
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,080
I will make you take them off.

895
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,680
How dare you lay
your hands on me?

896
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,040
- Let go off me Akash.
- Don't beat him up.

897
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,800
Come in Baskar.

898
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,600
We've been waiting for
you and Shivani's mom.

899
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,720
Why? What happened?

900
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,520
What happened!?

901
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,200
Look here, how brutally my
son has been beaten up.

902
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,880
Why did you beat him?

903
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,800
Arrogance! doesn't
behave like a girl.

904
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,640
I'm going to...

905
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,720
Please Ma'am.

906
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,640
You tell me,

907
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,720
why did she beat you?

908
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,280
My son didn't do anything,

909
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,520
she was the one who started it.

910
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,440
Will someone beat
up, for no reason?

911
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,560
Did you do anything wrong?

912
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,800
She's the guilty one, and
you're inquiring him?

913
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,400
- Ma'am.
- Uncle.

914
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:16,240
It was him, who gathered
us all to tease Akash.

915
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,800
What is that he was
teasing you with?

916
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,960
He was asking when will you
and Kalyani get married?

917
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,480
When I stopped him,
he twisted my arm.

918
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,000
Only then I beat him up.

919
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,160
So, does that give you
the right to beat up a boy?

920
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,000
You were brought up without
a dad, that's how you'll be.

921
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,360
- I'm going to...
- Hey!

922
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,320
Very good.

923
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:40,920
Should be like this.

924
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,560
If someone raises hand on
a woman, you should beat them.

925
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,080
That's what she did.

926
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,040
It's not important, if there's
a father or a mother.

927
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,160
What we teach our kids
is very important.

928
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,560
You didn't teach him well.

929
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,080
That's why he twisted her arm.

930
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,640
Correct, what Baskar
sir said is right.

931
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,560
Shivani didn't do
anything wrong.

932
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,240
Problem solved, everyone
get to the classroom.

933
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,400
Okay!

934
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,920
Beautiful.

935
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,000
Dad!

936
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,160
Dad!

937
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,480
- Dad!
- What's it dear?

938
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,480
Dad!

939
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,920
Thank you Dad!

940
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,960
I wish had a daughter like you.

941
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,000
Look here,

942
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,680
Even if Akash does
anything wrong,

943
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,240
you have to do exactly the same.

944
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,320
Ok Dad.

945
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,960
Thank God, Mom didn't come.

946
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,520
If at all she'd come,
would've changed my school.

947
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:25,480
Don't worry.

948
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,680
I'll speak to your mom.

949
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,240
Ok!?

950
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:30,360
If so, then I'll come with
mom to Skywalk tomorrow,

951
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,680
will you come there too?

952
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,160
- Wokay!
- Promise!?

953
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,280
Promise.

954
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,760
Who's that idiot, which
broke this expensive phone?

955
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,760
What does it matter to you?

956
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,080
Yeah that's true,

957
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,840
it doesn't matter who broke it.

958
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,640
The kid's tongue is quite sharp.

959
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,800
Shivani, go there and wait.

960
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,200
Do you want exactly
the same one?

961
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,840
We have many other options.

962
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:56,720
Look here,

963
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,200
it's enough if given
what is been asked of.

964
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,920
Ok, hold this for a moment.

965
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,000
Shivani, come

966
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,320
Sorry.

967
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,760
Sorry, Sorry, Sorry Ma'am.

968
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,480
Idiot, scoundrel, bally goose.

969
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,920
Don't you have any sense?

970
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,680
- Scoundrel!
- Shivani!

971
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:33,720
What are you doing?

972
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,520
What's wrong with girl?
Has she gone mad?

973
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,960
I'm not mad.

974
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Your mom is the mad
one, let go off me Mom.

975
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,360
- Let go off me.
- Shivani.

976
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,640
Hey! Your mom seemed to
have enjoyed my touch.

977
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,080
Why are you shouting?

978
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:52,880
Shivani.

979
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,760
You idiot.

980
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,360
Hello everyone!

981
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,640
Today we're here to
speak about Benelli.

982
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,680
Benelli is an international
automobile brand,

983
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,480
which was developed in 1911,

984
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,360
by 6 Benelli
brothers from Italy.

985
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,080
Ma'am.

986
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:16,320
In India, Benelli was
distributed by DSK Motor Wheels.

987
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:19,240
A part of DSK groups in 2012.

988
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,920
Power super bikes were
officially announced,

989
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,440
as a dealer in Chennai.

990
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,600
What's it now? You're angry
'cause I didn't fight with them.

991
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,480
Ok, you were using foul words,

992
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,040
where did you learn all of that?

993
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,760
You're more concerned about
me using foul language,

994
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,680
him touching is not
a concern to you.

995
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,120
What's the use of concern?

996
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,480
You did see right.

997
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,560
There were many
around us looking,

998
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,520
did even one soul
come forward to help?

999
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,440
That's our society.

1000
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:49,200
Have this.

1001
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:55,200
Just like that rowdy mentioned,

1002
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,320
do you think, even I
enjoyed his touch?

1003
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,600
Ok, don't cry now. I'll have it.

1004
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:36,800
What are you looking at?

1005
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,800
You must be wondering,
was it unintentional.

1006
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,840
It was very much intentional.

1007
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,200
Do you think I threw
it by accident?

1008
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,680
Nope I threw it
intentionally, scoundrel.

1009
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:51,760
Mummy!

1010
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,240
Baskar Sir, what happened?

1011
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,640
Hey, question the guys
who got beaten up.

1012
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,240
Sir, you guys tell
us what happened?

1013
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,120
What did you say!?

1014
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,360
Sorry, ask him the questions.

1015
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,320
Excuse me, excuse me. Ask me
everything I'll tell you.

1016
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,680
Parthasarathy from Triplicane,
hope you're doing good.

1017
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:39,720
These rowdies, were teasing that
lady and her daughter a lot.

1018
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,920
and this gentleman came
and bashed these guys.

1019
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,840
That's the problem of our
country no safety for woman.

1020
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:47,480
They left already.

1021
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,680
Ma'am, was he
fighting for you...?

1022
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:56,320
Look now,

1023
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,920
he blew everything
out of proportion.

1024
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,280
Fighting in public might be
something normal for him.

1025
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,160
Why does he have to get
us involved in it?

1026
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:07,400
Even now, you're scolding
at Akash's father.

1027
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,840
You're not angry at the scoundrels
who harassed us.

1028
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,600
You're the reason for all this.

1029
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:15,000
Why did you throw
milkshake on them?

1030
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,120
Why wouldn't I? Why are you
so scared looking at them?

1031
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,040
I'm not scared of them.

1032
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,200
I'm scared thinking of you.

1033
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:34,720
I was just like you.

1034
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,040
Was very short tempered.

1035
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:42,280
And that anger was the reason
I lost your father.

1036
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,080
In Kolkatta...a shopping
mall of similar kind,

1037
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:48,040
is where I and your father...

1038
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,360
What did you do?
Why did you touch me?

1039
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,760
- Anu!?
- Why did you touch me?

1040
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:54,600
What happened Anu?

1041
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,200
Anu listen to me, let go.
He was touching me.

1042
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,520
- Touching you...
- Come out...

1043
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,680
Come out

1044
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,160
How dare you touch me

1045
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,640
Scoundrel, why did you touch me?

1046
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,280
- Tell me...
- Relax Anu.

1047
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:05,400
Sanjay let go off me.

1048
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,800
Anu don't blow this
out of proportion.

1049
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,280
Everyone is looking at
us, it's embarrassing.

1050
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,760
No, only if we they get locked up by
Police, they'll come to their senses.

1051
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:11,920
Hey, no...no...no...no.

1052
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:12,560
Let him go.

1053
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,400
Anu let him go, listen to me.

1054
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,000
Let go Anu, trust me...trust
me let's go, please come.

1055
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,920
Sanjay you think of
this as a small issue?

1056
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,600
He touched me while you
were with me in the lift.

1057
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,480
- How dare he could...?
- Anu, I...

1058
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,200
When I was fighting,

1059
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,800
you didn't ask him anything,
instead asked me to let go.

1060
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:33,200
A girls confidence
is her partner.

1061
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,560
I feel really sorry
to say this Sanjay.

1062
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,160
I lost the confidence
I had on you.

1063
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,080
Sanjay!

1064
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,080
Brother, is the taxi available?

1065
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:07,640
Follow that car.

1066
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,800
Let's go.

1067
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:17,080
Sanjay!

1068
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,800
Sanjay, what happened to you?

1069
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,840
Why are you doing like this?
I said it when I was angry

1070
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:33,760
- Why are you...?
- Get in the car

1071
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:34,960
Quick

1072
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,760
Sanjay!

1073
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,360
Sanjay!

1074
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,280
Sanjay!

1075
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,840
The mistake I committed that day,

1076
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,200
you're repeating the same.

1077
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,800
I don't have the energy
to lose someone again.

1078
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,280
That's why I keep
asking you to be calm.

1079
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,280
I love you Mummy

1080
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,160
Love you so much

1081
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:57,720
I love you too

1082
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:02,720
"Oh Mother, Oh Mother..."

1083
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:05,920
"...You're the creation of love"

1084
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:10,400
"In this world,
a relation like yours..."

1085
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:13,360
"...is irreplaceable."

1086
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,160
"Mother I love you"

1087
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,080
"Mummy I love you"

1088
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,040
"Mummy I love you"

1089
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:21,960
"Mother I love you"

1090
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:41,400
"You're that beauty who
showers me with love"

1091
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:45,240
"Shall I wear you off
in loving me?"

1092
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:52,240
"Shall I turn you into my child
when you're in my arms"

1093
00:55:53,040 --> 00:56:00,880
"It's 'cause of your birth,
I was born as a mother"

1094
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:08,000
"My heart longs for you, just like
the swing in which you're swaying"

1095
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:09,960
"Mother I love you"

1096
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,880
"Mummy I love you"

1097
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,800
"Mummy I love you"

1098
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:15,960
"Mother I love you"

1099
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,840
"Come on mummy,
read me a fairy tale"

1100
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:53,560
"Let's go on a walk
with the rainbow"

1101
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:59,320
"There's no limit to the fun
we have together"

1102
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:05,600
"Honey dear, you keep
talking my dear"

1103
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:08,960
"Are you ok my dear?"

1104
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:13,280
"The smile which appears
after scoldings..."

1105
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:17,320
"Leaves a strong impact on me"

1106
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:21,160
"You're that beauty
who showers me with love"

1107
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:25,400
"Shall I wear you off
in loving me?"

1108
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:31,720
"Shall I turn you in to my
child when you're in my arms"

1109
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:40,760
"It's 'cause of your birth,
I was born as a mother"

1110
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:47,800
"My heart longs for you, just like
the swing in which you're swaying"

1111
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,760
"Mother I love you"

1112
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,640
"Mummy I love you"

1113
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,600
"Mummy I love you"

1114
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,800
"Mother I love you"

1115
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,640
- So this is your dad?
- Yes.

1116
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:10,640
Do you miss your dad?

1117
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:13,280
He passed away even
before I was born.

1118
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,360
Then how would I miss him?

1119
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,800
No matter what it is,
everyone likes their dad.

1120
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,840
But you don't like your dad.

1121
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,440
It's not like that.

1122
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,200
I like my Dad.

1123
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:27,600
But I don't like that he fights.

1124
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,080
If you don't like him, then
give your father to me.

1125
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:34,960
I'm serious about it.

1126
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,760
If so, will you give
me your mother?

1127
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:38,920
OK!

1128
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:42,120
Then let us all happily
live in the same house.

1129
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,040
That means,

1130
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,920
you want my dad to get
married to your mom?

1131
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:46,800
Yes!

1132
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:48,960
Instead you can push
your mom in to a well.

1133
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,400
Hey listen to me.

1134
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:51,920
You'll get a mother.

1135
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,360
I'll get a father.

1136
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,040
Imagine how happy we can be.

1137
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:56,040
Shivani.

1138
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:57,920
Oh no, mom is coming up.

1139
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:58,840
Ok, Ok.

1140
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,120
Juice!

1141
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:05,880
Thank you mummy.

1142
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,040
Akash.

1143
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,480
You're so mellow.

1144
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:11,240
Why is that not rubbing on
to Shivani's character?

1145
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:13,200
Why? What's wrong
with my character?

1146
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:15,120
Akash is aware of it.

1147
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:16,240
Don't you Akash?

1148
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:20,120
Shivani said you like
white chocolate.

1149
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,000
Try them.

1150
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,040
Thank you mummy.

1151
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:23,360
You're welcome.

1152
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:28,640
How can you even imagine, getting
married such a person to my dad?

1153
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:31,800
A courageous father,

1154
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,600
a soft spoken mother.

1155
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:36,760
You and me, everyone
in the same house,

1156
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:39,080
imagine how happy we could be.

1157
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,760
With that, your mom will
lose all her happiness too.

1158
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:45,520
Do you think, my
mom is happy now?

1159
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:49,680
My mom has a constant fear
that there's no one for us.

1160
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,440
I'm not kidding...

1161
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:54,360
...I'm serious about it.

1162
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,440
Even I'm serious about it.

1163
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,880
Your mom and my dad are
not a match at all.

1164
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,480
See, exactly he's here honking.

1165
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:06,400
Delete whatever we've
spoken till now.

1166
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:09,080
Mummy!

1167
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:12,120
Come here, Akash's dad is here.

1168
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,120
For what?

1169
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,080
So that he can fight
and appear on TV.

1170
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:16,320
I won't come.

1171
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:19,280
Get lost!

1172
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:20,680
Bye mummy!

1173
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:22,560
See you Akash, bye.

1174
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:30,960
Dad.

1175
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:33,680
You've come for the first
time, come inside.

1176
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:34,680
Wokay!

1177
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:35,880
Beautiful.

1178
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,640
Dad, we don't have
time for that.

1179
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:39,680
We've to go out.

1180
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,240
- Where?
- For shopping.

1181
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:42,320
Shopping!?

1182
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:45,600
You had planned it, and have forgotten.
Get inside the car.

1183
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:50,080
I'll come another day.

1184
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:51,240
Ok, Dad.

1185
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,000
Hey...

1186
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:00,320
...you keep ranting
about manners.

1187
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:03,320
When your friend invited,
should've gone right?

1188
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:04,840
It was Shivani who invited?

1189
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,240
Not her mother.

1190
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:09,440
It's not good manners going,
without her mother inviting you.

1191
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:12,840
That isn't good manners right?

1192
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:15,760
That didn't strike me.

1193
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,800
I would've gone in like a fool.

1194
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,560
Keep me reminded
of these things.

1195
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:31,320
Hey, what are you
doing with my phone?

1196
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:33,040
I'm looking at
the pictures, mummy.

1197
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:35,080
You're so cute, mummy.

1198
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,440
I know baby.

1199
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,440
Enough of looking at
them, go to sleep.

1200
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:40,760
Mummy one second.

1201
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:42,920
Get lost!

1202
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,200
Hello, tell me Shivani.

1203
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:11,920
I've sent a picture from Mom's
phone to your Dad's phone.

1204
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:14,160
Oh no, what have you done?

1205
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:17,240
First go and check how does
your father react to it?

1206
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,440
What reaction?

1207
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:20,800
I'm going to delete it
before dad sees it.

1208
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:24,440
I'm responsible only until
the good are delivered.

1209
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:25,440
It's been delivered right?

1210
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:26,720
Now it's your responsibility.

1211
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:49,000
Where are you going?
The accounts aren't done yet.

1212
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:51,520
Stomach is upset.

1213
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,760
You were fine all this while,
what happened to you suddenly?

1214
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:56,280
Stomach upset is uncertain.

1215
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:57,680
Will it give a warning?

1216
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:59,640
Is your stomach up there?

1217
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:05,880
Did I question you, when you're
stomach was upset last week?

1218
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:08,240
I don't even have rights
to a stomach upset.

1219
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:09,840
No, I was just...

1220
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:13,040
Oh God!

1221
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:57,000
Shivani!

1222
01:03:57,880 --> 01:03:59,000
I'm done.

1223
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:01,960
What's it mummy?

1224
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:06,480
Look, that man has sent me
a message, saying I'm good.

1225
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:08,480
What does it matter to me, how he is.

1226
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:12,240
Wow! Dad looks so
handsome in this.

1227
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:13,040
Dad uh!?

1228
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:14,400
When did he become your father?

1229
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:16,280
Then why does Akash
calls you mummy?

1230
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:18,920
Akash doesn't have a mother,
so he calls me Mummy.

1231
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:21,440
Even I don't have a father,
so I call him Dad.

1232
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:23,800
He's not like him,
he's a good boy.

1233
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:26,200
This man, sends pictures
to girls in the night,

1234
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,880
and asks what are you doing
and what are you wearing?

1235
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:33,040
Oh God, dad would've sent this by
mistake instead of someone else.

1236
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:35,480
If we delete it, will be gone.

1237
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:36,280
Take this.

1238
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:41,040
If at all I get this again,
I'll complaint to cyber cell.

1239
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:44,360
Shivani!

1240
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,520
My dad has sent
a stylish selfie.

1241
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:48,400
Delete that before
your mom sees that.

1242
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:50,240
My mother has seen it already,

1243
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:52,120
also have created
a scene due to that.

1244
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:53,400
My dad is a poor thing.

1245
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:54,680
As it is he's got a bad name,

1246
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:55,680
on top of that, this too.

1247
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:59,600
No matter how much you try,
your mom will not like my dad.

1248
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,960
My mom likes you.

1249
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,600
Just like that, she'll
start liking your dad too.

1250
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:09,480
From tomorrow, you
live with my mother,

1251
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:11,680
and I'll live with your dad.

1252
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:18,080
Hi Mummy.

1253
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:19,160
Hi Akash.

1254
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,280
Have you joined dance classes?

1255
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,760
I had given a book to Shivani

1256
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:26,600
I came to get that, but then she
left for music class looking for me.

1257
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:27,400
Oh is it.

1258
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:29,680
Ok, then come with me, I'll
drop you at the music class.

1259
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:31,560
And will pick up
Shivani from there.

1260
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:32,800
Mummy, Shivani isn't there.

1261
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:34,640
Dad would have got
there to pick me,

1262
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:35,920
so she went with him.

1263
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,280
And asked me to come with you.

1264
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:39,280
Oh I see,

1265
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:41,040
It'll take longer
for me to get home.

1266
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:42,360
I have a lot of shopping to do.

1267
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:44,120
No issues mummy, I'll wait.

1268
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:45,000
Fine then.

1269
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:47,520
I got it.

1270
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:52,520
This is our plan.

1271
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:53,400
What?

1272
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:56,400
I wish to be with father.

1273
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:59,240
And Akash wishes
to be with mother.

1274
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,880
Both of our dreams
have come true.

1275
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:05,240
Dad!

1276
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:07,400
Remember you said
the other day...

1277
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:11,040
...that it would've been great
if you had a daughter like me.

1278
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:12,760
You were just kidding right?

1279
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:14,720
No dear, I meant it.

1280
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:17,200
Regardless if it's
a boy or a girl,

1281
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,480
should be courageous.

1282
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:20,400
Shouldn't come crying
when they get hit,

1283
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:21,360
should fight back.

1284
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:22,960
That's what I like.

1285
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:28,760
Yayy!

1286
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:31,760
"Not sure if I'm a good person"

1287
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:34,680
"Nor sure if I'm a bad person"

1288
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:37,520
"No idea if I'm a good boy"

1289
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:40,480
"Baskar is a Rascal"

1290
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:43,680
"Baskar is a Rascal"

1291
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:51,840
"I'm built like a beast"

1292
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:54,720
"But love is making
a deal with heart"

1293
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:57,520
"It's a deal
I'll never understand"

1294
01:06:57,655 --> 01:07:00,855
"I've mixed feelings"

1295
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:10,840
"Baskar is a Rascal"

1296
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:13,600
"Baskar is a Rascal"

1297
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:16,160
"Can you please
introduce me to myself"

1298
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:19,440
"My personality has changed"

1299
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:22,440
"Baskar is a Rascal"

1300
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,960
"Baskar is a Rascal"

1301
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:28,160
"This is a weird feeling"

1302
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:31,080
"A deal which confuses you"

1303
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:34,320
"Don't cry buddy,
Don't cry buddy"

1304
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,840
"This is a strange
kind of feeling"

1305
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:39,880
"Baskar is a Rascal"

1306
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:42,560
"Baskar is a Rascal"

1307
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:45,360
"Can you please
introduce me to myself"

1308
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:48,760
"My personality has changed"

1309
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:11,760
"2*2 = 4"

1310
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:14,640
"Life will get as
cool as a Kulfi"

1311
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:17,520
"Knives and swords
will disappear"

1312
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:20,040
"Life will take a new turn"

1313
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:22,920
"Heart has started to long..."

1314
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,160
"And is provoking to love..."

1315
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:29,400
"You don't need this Boss"

1316
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:32,080
"Seems like you'll
lose your sanity"

1317
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:34,960
"Baskar is a Rascal"

1318
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:37,680
"Baskar is a Rascal"

1319
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:40,240
"Can you please
introduce me to myself"

1320
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:43,360
"My personality has changed"

1321
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:15,560
"Ego will gradually subside"

1322
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:18,280
"I was somewhere
close to that state"

1323
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:21,280
"Right or Wrong are
two qualities"

1324
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:23,960
"But I was somewhere in between"

1325
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,800
"Wondering if you'll change"

1326
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:29,520
"Are you worried about that?"

1327
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,240
Do you call this driving?
Can't you see people coming?

1328
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:33,160
It's not a runway.

1329
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:34,280
What if I had got hurt?

1330
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:37,680
Don't you have any sense? First
wear your helmet and ride.

1331
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:39,840
First teach your dad to drive.

1332
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:42,960
"My personality has changed"

1333
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:45,920
"Baskar is a Rascal"

1334
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,440
"Baskar is a Rascal"

1335
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:51,720
"This is a weird feeling"

1336
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:54,600
"A deal which confuses you"

1337
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:57,680
"Don't cry buddy,
Don't cry buddy"

1338
01:09:57,720 --> 01:10:00,480
"This is a weird feeling"

1339
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:03,200
"Baskar is a Rascal"

1340
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:06,000
"Baskar is a Rascal"

1341
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:08,760
"Can you please
introduce me to myself"

1342
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:12,200
"My personality has changed"

1343
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:15,200
Mom.

1344
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:16,800
Akash's dad is here.

1345
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:17,640
Yeah I saw.

1346
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:19,280
Why didn't you invite him in?

1347
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:20,560
He's sleeping.

1348
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:24,680
I did say that mom
won't invite him in.

1349
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:27,560
Get lost!

1350
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:30,200
Dad!

1351
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:32,360
Let's go.

1352
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:33,360
Oh no!

1353
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,440
- Did Akash leave?
- Yes he did.

1354
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,160
I forgot to give him
these chocolates.

1355
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:37,640
Will you go and
give this to him?

1356
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:40,000
If that's the case,
shall I invite dad in?

1357
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:42,240
Ummmm, Ok!

1358
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:43,600
Hey Akash!

1359
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:46,360
Take this, mom gave these
chocolates to you.

1360
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:47,360
Thank you.

1361
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:50,760
Dad, mom had asked for
you, please come in.

1362
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:54,280
Not today, may be
some other day.

1363
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:56,720
- Ok!?
- Ok, Dad.

1364
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:00,640
- Bye.
- Bye.

1365
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:05,000
What's in that?

1366
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:06,440
White Chocolates.

1367
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,200
Do you like white chocolates?

1368
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,800
Mom is aware that I
like white chocolates.

1369
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:11,960
It's you, who is not aware.

1370
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,120
Shivani must've told her.

1371
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:15,160
Shivani is a very good girl.

1372
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,440
But her mother...

1373
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:19,800
She could've invited me in?

1374
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:20,680
Arrogant!

1375
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,160
Don't mistake her.

1376
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:23,560
Mom is a good person.

1377
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:24,960
She likes me a lot.

1378
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:27,360
Hey, who wouldn't like you?

1379
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:29,200
You're decent.

1380
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:30,920
You're well mannered.

1381
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,360
Even I like Mom a lot.

1382
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:38,960
You like everyone except me.

1383
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:41,400
Mom has a very soft nature.

1384
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:43,760
She caring and loving.

1385
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,320
Shivani's mom is really sweet.

1386
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:50,920
Dad.

1387
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:55,720
Even my mother would've
been the same right?

1388
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:20,760
Oh, Dad!

1389
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:23,200
Shivani's mom was talking
about you a lot yesterday.

1390
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,000
what would've she said?

1391
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:26,560
That I'm a Rascal,

1392
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:27,840
fighter cock,

1393
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:29,160
hot head,

1394
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:30,840
That would've been his words.

1395
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,360
Nothing of that sort, Dad.

1396
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:33,880
That's how it is.

1397
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:35,160
I'm sure about it.

1398
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:52,200
If someone gives you
chocolates with love,

1399
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:53,360
you got to eat them.

1400
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:54,320
Shouldn't waste them.

1401
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:56,560
I didn't waste it, just kept
them inside the fridge.

1402
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:58,040
You should have them
while they're hot.

1403
01:12:58,120 --> 01:12:59,520
Shouldn't freeze them
inside the fridge.

1404
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:00,200
Take this.

1405
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,600
Why are you with school
books during vacations?

1406
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:07,960
This is not a school book,
It's called "Chicken Soup".

1407
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:08,800
A Cook Book!

1408
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:11,680
Ask Murugan, he'll make
anything you wish for.

1409
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:13,480
This is not a Cook Book.

1410
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:14,560
It's a novel.

1411
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:16,000
Inspirational Stories,

1412
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:18,280
Compiled by Jack Canfield
and Mark Hansen.

1413
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:20,280
Oh that book!

1414
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:21,840
Keep reading.

1415
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:27,840
How's it?

1416
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,280
Interesting stories.

1417
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:32,200
Hey, I was asking
about the chocolates.

1418
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:34,440
Mom gave them, obviously
they'll be good.

1419
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:40,600
While driving back, you mentioned
her speaking good things about me,

1420
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:45,120
yeah right!? what did she say?

1421
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:48,600
Hey, she told you and
you're asking me.

1422
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:50,400
She did mention something,

1423
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:52,040
sorry I forgot.

1424
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,000
Wokay!

1425
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:01,320
- Do tell me once you remember...
- Hmmm.

1426
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Akash!

1427
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:18,880
AaaKash!

1428
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:21,320
How come you turned in early?

1429
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,480
Dad,it's 10 'O' Clock already.

1430
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,720
It's only 9:55pm now.

1431
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:27,560
Do you remember now?

1432
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:29,160
What?

1433
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:31,440
About what Shivani's
mom spoke about me...

1434
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:33,400
I can't remember anything now,

1435
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:36,000
I'm really sleepy,
get to bed Dad.

1436
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:40,320
You can remember junk about people
who make mutton and chicken soup.

1437
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:43,120
But you forget something
good spoken about me.

1438
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:46,080
Good Night.

1439
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:54,120
Shivani!

1440
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:56,840
I pity my Dad, he's
having sleepless nights.

1441
01:14:56,920 --> 01:15:02,600
He was restless all night awake and
didn't let me sleep in peace too.

1442
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:05,520
Why don't we just drop
the plan of getting them together.

1443
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:08,920
First we have to
get them to meet.

1444
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:09,880
How?

1445
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:12,360
That's why I have my
B'day as trump card.

1446
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:25,120
What are you doing sitting
here half asleep?

1447
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:29,680
I know.

1448
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:32,040
You want a dress for your B'day.

1449
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:33,280
Am I right?

1450
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:36,280
I don't want B'day
neither a dress.

1451
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:37,320
Why?

1452
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:40,720
Just the two of us
go for shopping,

1453
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:42,760
just the two of us buy a cake,

1454
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:45,080
and just the two
of us celebrate.

1455
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:46,840
I don't find any joy in this.

1456
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:48,360
It's so boring.

1457
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:49,400
Ok.

1458
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:51,960
Why are you beating
around the bushes?

1459
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:54,080
You want to invite
Akash and his dad...

1460
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:55,000
...isn't it?

1461
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:56,240
Shall we invite them?

1462
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:58,240
If we do, it will be awesome.

1463
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:00,760
Invite them.

1464
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:02,600
They won't come
if I invite them.

1465
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:04,200
You should invite them.

1466
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:07,280
OK!

1467
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:10,160
Thank you, Mummy.

1468
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:28,280
Hey Akash!

1469
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:30,160
Haven't you left
for the party yet?

1470
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:31,040
Not yet...

1471
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:33,000
He said will get
ready and got in...

1472
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:34,360
...it's been two hours,

1473
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:35,240
he's yet to come out.

1474
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:38,280
Why is it taking so long for him
to wear shirt and a veshti?

1475
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:39,800
Baskar!

1476
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:42,240
Did your dad doze off inside?

1477
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:43,960
- Baskar!
- I'll be out...

1478
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:45,440
He's awake.

1479
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:47,040
Have a nice party.

1480
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:57,160
"Look! How Mr Baskar dressed up"

1481
01:16:57,240 --> 01:17:00,760
"With coat and suit
looks like a big-shot"

1482
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,040
How do I look?

1483
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:03,120
Really!?

1484
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:04,800
What's wrong with you Dad?

1485
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:05,760
Why?

1486
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:07,520
Is it bad?

1487
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:09,720
Do you think we're going to
a fancy dress competition?

1488
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:12,200
Hey, don't we have to look
suave, heading to a B'day party.

1489
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:14,360
This party has just
the four of us.

1490
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:17,080
You, me, mother and Shivani.

1491
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:19,240
Hey, a party is a party!

1492
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:21,200
Ok, come on.

1493
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:22,520
Wait, Wait, Wait.

1494
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:26,200
How does this look?

1495
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:28,640
Is it bad?

1496
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:32,240
"Look at the new style of Baskar"

1497
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:35,520
Wait.

1498
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:37,760
This one is the best.

1499
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,240
The dress itself a tad too much.

1500
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:43,400
On top of that sunglasses.

1501
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:44,840
Keep that in your pocket.

1502
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:50,400
Why don't I hang it here?

1503
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:51,880
It'll look cheap.

1504
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:54,520
Hey, it's awesome
if Salman Khan does,

1505
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:55,920
but if I do it's cheap.

1506
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:58,520
It'll look cheap if you wear it,
regardless it being expensive.

1507
01:17:58,560 --> 01:17:59,800
I didn't say anything.

1508
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:09,120
Mummy, Akash and
his dad are here.

1509
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:10,800
Go, and invite them in.

1510
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:12,600
Mom, you go and invite them in.

1511
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:14,640
Me!? I won't go.

1512
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:15,440
You should go.

1513
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:16,760
You go and invite them,

1514
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:19,040
If I do they won't come in.

1515
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:22,040
Oh god, please go
and invite them in.

1516
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:27,760
- Hi Mummy.
- Hi Akash, come in.

1517
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:29,560
Dad's here too.

1518
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:35,640
Come on mom, invite him in.

1519
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:40,440
Excuse me!

1520
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:47,120
Dad!

1521
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:49,520
Mom is calling you.

1522
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:55,720
Hi!

1523
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:57,000
Come in.

1524
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:08,560
Come.

1525
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:11,600
Awesome!

1526
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:12,680
Thank you.

1527
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:16,640
Mummy, isn't Dad looking
dashing in this dress?

1528
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:18,880
Yeah, let's get in.

1529
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:20,160
- Yeah!
- Dad!

1530
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:23,160
You continue to
dress up like this.

1531
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:25,680
Veshti and Shirts are boring.

1532
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:26,680
Okay.

1533
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:27,920
Beautiful.

1534
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:29,480
Happy Birthday Shivani.

1535
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:30,920
Thank you.

1536
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:33,440
- Many Many Happy Birthday.
- Thank you Dad.

1537
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:35,560
Sit down.

1538
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:38,520
Dad, how do you find our house?

1539
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:40,080
It looks really good.

1540
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:42,520
Mom has maintained
the house really well.

1541
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:44,800
Shivani, come inside.

1542
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:47,400
You sit here.

1543
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:49,360
- Shivani!
- I'm coming Mom!

1544
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:01,360
"Look carefully head to toe"

1545
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:04,280
"Of Baskar's new style, dear"

1546
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:09,880
Take this and give it to them.

1547
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:11,520
You go and give it to them.

1548
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:12,400
Why so?

1549
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:13,800
Is he here to find a match?

1550
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:14,840
Go and give it to them.

1551
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:15,920
Mom, you go and give them.

1552
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:16,800
I won't go.

1553
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,640
Just go and give it to them.

1554
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:21,200
- Dad.
- Yeah.

1555
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:23,000
How's the dress?

1556
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:25,120
The black dress is really good.

1557
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:27,920
Oh God, Dad...

1558
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:29,440
...I was talking about my dress.

1559
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:30,920
Oh it's awesome.

1560
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:32,760
- Mom.
- Huh!?

1561
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:36,880
Weren't you trying out dresses
to wear while Dad is here,

1562
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:39,560
now Dad himself have said it.
That this one is good.

1563
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:42,560
Oh god, it's embarrassing.

1564
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:44,920
No dear, the juice tastes good.

1565
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:46,360
Mom has prepared it well.

1566
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:49,560
Dad, it's a packaged juice.

1567
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:53,760
So what? You need a talent
to select that too.

1568
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:57,240
Akash and Shivani come
on, let's cut the cake.

1569
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:58,480
- Hmmm.
- Yeah.

1570
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:19,640
"Happy Birthday to you"

1571
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:22,640
"Happy Birthday to you"

1572
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:26,480
"Happy Birthday Shivani..."

1573
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:29,240
Hey, did you invite others?

1574
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:30,280
I didn't.

1575
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:32,320
- Then who is it?
- I'll go and check.

1576
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:16,080
Hi Anu, how are you?

1577
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:26,880
Who's that?

1578
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:29,480
Sorry, I'm Sanjay.

1579
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:31,040
Anu's husband.

1580
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,080
Shivani is my daughter.

1581
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:41,280
It's the first time
I'm seeing Shivani.

1582
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:46,600
Happy Birthday Shivani.

1583
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:49,680
Love you!

1584
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:05,320
The day when that
gangster shot me,

1585
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:06,880
I never thought I'll live.

1586
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:08,760
More than me being alive,

1587
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:11,880
finding you and the child
marked my rebirth.

1588
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:15,160
Even my parents said,
I can't find you.

1589
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:19,240
I came to life, after seeing
you in the news on TV.

1590
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:23,320
I'm so happy now.

1591
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:27,120
Just like you wanted,
as soon as possible...

1592
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:28,840
...we'll get legally married.

1593
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:39,200
Shivani.

1594
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:42,600
This is a very
special day for you.

1595
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:44,240
Because,

1596
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:46,160
your Dad is back.

1597
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:48,720
Enjoy the day.

1598
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:53,360
See you later.

1599
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:02,880
Sanjay.

1600
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:04,080
Sanjay.

1601
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:08,160
Quick.

1602
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:15,320
Anu.

1603
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:16,680
Anu!

1604
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:17,760
What happened?

1605
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,440
I don't know what to do?

1606
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:20,840
Sanjay was shot by someone.

1607
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:22,200
- Oh no!
- Move aside.

1608
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:25,160
It's an emergency,
please make way.

1609
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:26,080
Excuse me!

1610
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:26,920
What are you doing?

1611
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:27,560
Where are you taking him?

1612
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:29,320
It's because, there's
no facility here...

1613
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:31,960
...so we're taking him
to CIMAR medical center.

1614
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:36,560
Hey, this is an ICU ambulance.

1615
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:38,680
- No one is allowed inside this.
- Let's follow them.

1616
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:49,400
Excuse me!

1617
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:51,160
A patient was brought
from Sanjeevan hospital...

1618
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:52,400
...do you know where's
the operation theatre?

1619
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:53,400
Patient's name?

1620
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:54,760
Sanjay...Sanjay Sharma!

1621
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:55,600
One moment Ma'am.

1622
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:00,760
Sorry Ma'am, there are no
patients under this name.

1623
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:03,240
No, he was brought from
Sanjeevan hospital.

1624
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:04,440
In your ambulance.

1625
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:06,760
No ma'am, we didn't send
any ambulance from here.

1626
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:07,680
Are you sure?

1627
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:10,040
Yes Ma'am, why don't check
with other hospitals?

1628
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:12,680
Didn't they say it was
CIMAR Medical Center?

1629
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:14,080
Where else would've
have they gone?

1630
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:15,280
Ok, you come.

1631
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:32,840
Who's Anu here?

1632
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:34,440
- Yes.
- Sir's calling you.

1633
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:39,720
Please be seated.

1634
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:44,200
How long have you
known Sanjay Sharma?

1635
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:45,320
Since one year.

1636
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:48,720
While I was doing my
PG in Calcutta...

1637
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:49,840
...I met Sanjay.

1638
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:51,520
So you've been
together for a year?

1639
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:53,520
Without getting married?

1640
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:54,760
Ah...yes Sir!

1641
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:56,080
We're living in together.

1642
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:57,440
Where are your parents?

1643
01:25:57,480 --> 01:25:58,560
They're in Canada.

1644
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,880
Have you ever met
Sanjay's parents?

1645
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:02,400
I've never met them.

1646
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:04,280
They're in Bangalore.

1647
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:07,000
In fact, we were
going to meet them,

1648
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:08,920
and were suppose to get married.

1649
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,920
Meanwhile this
happened to Sanjay.

1650
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:13,280
Are your parents aware that
you're getting married?

1651
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:14,720
No sir.

1652
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:16,800
Without your parents
knowledge...

1653
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:18,920
...why were you
in a hurry to get married?

1654
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:21,720
That's 'cause...

1655
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:26,600
You're pregnant.

1656
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:31,160
Right!?

1657
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:35,280
Yes Sir.

1658
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:38,480
Aren't you Jaswant
Malhotra's daughter?

1659
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:39,280
Yes Sir.

1660
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:41,520
Can you please wait outside?

1661
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:42,560
Ok.

1662
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:53,080
Wasn't it you and Sanjay who
murdered that girl's father?

1663
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:57,560
But you're still pretending
to be her friend.

1664
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:58,640
Why is that?

1665
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:00,040
Sir!?

1666
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:03,400
I don't understand what
are you trying to say?

1667
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:04,560
Shut up!

1668
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:11,080
You know everything.

1669
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:13,440
Who shot Sanjay?

1670
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:17,120
Where's Sanjay now?

1671
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:21,080
You're aware of everything.

1672
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:24,120
Don't play with us.

1673
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,600
I don't know anything Sir.

1674
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:32,160
Believe me.

1675
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:34,640
I swear, I don't know anything.

1676
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:38,680
I know that you don't
know anything.

1677
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:44,320
Sanjay is not an ordinary
person like you think.

1678
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:45,680
He's a professional killer.

1679
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:48,760
And a sharp shooter.

1680
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:53,120
Your friend's father,
Jaswant Malhotra...

1681
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:55,480
...is a very popular Indian
Geological Scientist.

1682
01:27:55,720 --> 01:27:58,840
He found where the Plutonium
Mines were in India.

1683
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:02,240
He wanted India to reap its
benefits, so he had kept it safe.

1684
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:05,200
Few people from other nations
who knew about this,

1685
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:07,800
tried their best to get them
with help of criminals in India.

1686
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:10,200
Sanjay...

1687
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:12,120
...is one among those criminals.

1688
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:16,560
It was hard to get through
Scientist Jaswant's security.

1689
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:18,760
As you are friends with
scientist's daughter...

1690
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:21,240
...he used you to
get in his house.

1691
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:24,320
In order to kill him, he came
along with you to that party.

1692
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:25,960
Hey stop, stop, stop...

1693
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,040
They're my friends,

1694
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:28,720
- you don't have to check them.
- Ok

1695
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:30,680
Hi Anu, how have you been?

1696
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:32,800
- This is Sanjay.
- Hi, how are you Sanjay?

1697
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,640
The course will be
done this year.

1698
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:01,040
DADDY!

1699
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:07,960
Daddy!

1700
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:14,360
We've been tailing
him since that day.

1701
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:16,800
In order to see who's
pulling the strings,

1702
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:18,040
we kept him loose.

1703
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:22,720
Now Sanjay getting shot and being
kidnapped, could be that gang.

1704
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:25,320
But from our investigation,

1705
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:27,440
we found you innocent.

1706
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:30,240
Anu!

1707
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:32,440
Listen to what I got to say.

1708
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:34,520
You just leave Kolkatta

1709
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:36,600
About you leaving...

1710
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:39,120
...even your friend
shouldn't know.

1711
01:29:39,160 --> 01:29:40,040
That's better...

1712
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:42,640
...for you and your
child to be born.

1713
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:46,040
As you're from my place,

1714
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:48,520
I'm doing this favour.

1715
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:49,760
Just...

1716
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:51,360
Just get lost from here.

1717
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:54,920
Go...Go away.

1718
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:02,840
You don't scare of the criminal
who made you both left alone

1719
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:06,480
Until you and Shivani are being alone
will bring problems to you

1720
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:09,600
Don't take this as I'm
doing a favour to you.

1721
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:13,040
It's my heartfelt desire to see
you as my daughter in law.

1722
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:14,000
Sit down uncle.

1723
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:17,560
More than my son
getting a good wife,

1724
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:19,800
I want a good mother
for my grandson.

1725
01:30:20,360 --> 01:30:21,280
No uncle,

1726
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:23,920
about another marriage...

1727
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:25,840
...I can't even think about it.

1728
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:31,400
As of now I'm only concerned
about Shivani and her future.

1729
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:34,120
That's exactly why
I'm insisting.

1730
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:36,080
To provide a bright
future to your daughter,

1731
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:37,800
you guys should get married.

1732
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:40,360
Shivani is Baskar's life.

1733
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:42,480
I know that uncle.

1734
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:43,480
But still...

1735
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:46,040
...this won't work out.

1736
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:52,120
I'm sorry.

1737
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:54,000
Oh no, uncle.

1738
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:56,520
My intentions weren't
to hurt your feelings.

1739
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:58,840
I don't want another
marriage in my life.

1740
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:00,640
Sorry uncle.

1741
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:02,040
No no, it's ok.

1742
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:03,080
I...

1743
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:05,200
...don't want to force
you more than this.

1744
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:29,200
It was me who compelled
grandpa to come here.

1745
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:31,920
I like you very much.

1746
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,560
That's why I did this.

1747
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:37,640
If at all I knew, that
would've hurt you so much...

1748
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:39,240
...I would've never done it.

1749
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:41,440
I'm sorry mummy.

1750
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:43,480
I'm really sorry.

1751
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:58,040
Hey Akash!

1752
01:31:58,120 --> 01:32:00,760
Mom agreed to get married.

1753
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:02,960
She wants to talk to Dad.

1754
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:06,920
Tomorrow I and mom are going
to meet Dad at the shop.

1755
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:07,560
Awesome!

1756
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:09,520
Come let's go and tell
grandpa about it.

1757
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:11,280
- Good Morning Sir.
- Good Morning.

1758
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:14,720
Hello!

1759
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:18,120
Dad, Mom wants to speak to
you, we're coming to the shop.

1760
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:19,480
Yeah ok, beautiful.

1761
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:20,720
I'll wait in my room.

1762
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:21,720
- Hey!
- Yes boss.

1763
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:23,600
Important guests are arriving.
Make sure no one gets in.

1764
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:24,560
Ok Boss.

1765
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:25,840
Hey pull down the shutters.

1766
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:27,200
Pull down the shutter!

1767
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:28,640
Hey, why are you pulling
down the shutter?

1768
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:30,000
You did ask, not
to let anyone in.

1769
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:31,600
I meant the office
room, not the shop.

1770
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:32,480
Ask them to roll up the shutter.

1771
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:33,680
Open the shutters.

1772
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:34,880
Ask them to close the office.

1773
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:36,040
Then how will I get in?

1774
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:37,800
That's right, how will you get in.

1775
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:39,560
- Then open the office.
- What about the shutter?

1776
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:41,480
You'll get slippered,
do as he says.

1777
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:42,840
Good Morning Boss.

1778
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:45,080
Morning, sit down why
are you getting up?

1779
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:45,960
You're wiser than me.

1780
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:46,640
That's right.

1781
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:49,920
Aren't you ashamed removing
saree at this age?

1782
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:52,520
- It's a mannequin.
- You're fierce with it.

1783
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:55,400
Excuse me.

1784
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:57,240
- Yes!?
- Isn't that Mr. Baskar?

1785
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:58,440
That's right.

1786
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:00,040
How come he's here?

1787
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:02,320
He's the owner of this shop.

1788
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:04,480
Oh, Oh!

1789
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:07,520
Hello!

1790
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:08,480
Boss...

1791
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:10,680
...there's a lady
here to meet you.

1792
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:13,280
I'm waiting for
her, send her up.

1793
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:15,840
Guest has arrived,
don't let anyone in.

1794
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:18,200
Now that you've said,
I won't let anyone in.

1795
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:24,080
Is this what he meant, when he
was ranting about mannerism.

1796
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:25,000
Excuse me!

1797
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:27,000
Yes come in, Oh you're here...

1798
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:27,800
Please come.

1799
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:28,600
Mr.Baskar!?

1800
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:32,640
Baskar Sir, is sitting
inside and waiting for you.

1801
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:34,040
- Ok I'll go.
- Please get in.

1802
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:36,960
- Hello!
- Yes!

1803
01:33:38,440 --> 01:33:39,400
Baskar!

1804
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:41,920
Ah...how come you're here?

1805
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:43,400
I came for shopping.

1806
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:45,680
And came to know
you own this shop.

1807
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:48,800
So came down to thank you.

1808
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:51,120
Thank uh!
For what?

1809
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:53,160
Siddharth and I are
getting married.

1810
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:54,520
It's all 'cause of you.

1811
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,520
Thanks a lot.

1812
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:58,640
Boss was really strict on
not letting anyone in.

1813
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:00,160
He even asked to pull
down the shutters,

1814
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:01,600
I said will take care
of it not to worry.

1815
01:34:01,640 --> 01:34:02,800
A secret meeting, right!?

1816
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:04,600
- Very kind of you.
- Ok, Ok.

1817
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:05,680
Thank you Baskar.

1818
01:34:06,280 --> 01:34:07,480
Thank you so much.

1819
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:16,480
Wait...

1820
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:17,960
- I...
- Come Shivani.

1821
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:20,200
- Oh no...
- Shivani come.

1822
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:21,760
How did this happen?

1823
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:22,760
When did they get in?

1824
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:24,840
Wasn't she the expected guest?

1825
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:26,560
When did she get in?

1826
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:29,440
Kalyani! No...no...Anu, Anu!

1827
01:34:30,200 --> 01:34:33,120
Why did you call them
at the same time?

1828
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:35,800
Why did she come looking
for you and gave a hug?

1829
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:36,440
Huh?

1830
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:39,080
It's very common for
people from Mumbai.

1831
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:40,280
You don't even know that.

1832
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:42,800
I'm aware,
but the person who saw isn't.

1833
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:45,960
She got angry without knowing
what exactly happened.

1834
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,040
What can I do in that?

1835
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:48,040
Dear Son.

1836
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:52,240
If a girl is jealous 'cause
another girl gave you a hug,

1837
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:54,120
that means, she is
in love with you.

1838
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:56,520
Then shall I call her?

1839
01:34:57,600 --> 01:34:58,840
No need to call.

1840
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:00,880
You first go and speak
to her in person.

1841
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:03,280
Until that my son,
control yourself.

1842
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:04,120
Boss!

1843
01:35:04,160 --> 01:35:06,600
Big Boss is asking you to
speak to Shvani's mother.

1844
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:08,760
But before that, you got to
apologize to actress Kalyani.

1845
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:10,240
Why should I apologize
to Kalyani?

1846
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:12,320
'Cause when she hugged you...

1847
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:14,480
...you were silent and
were happy about it.

1848
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:20,720
The reason I was in
hiding all these days,

1849
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:22,200
he's right here now.

1850
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:25,920
Sanjay might've reformed...

1851
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,880
...but that doesn't
matter to me.

1852
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:30,840
The betrayal from before
is more than enough.

1853
01:35:31,720 --> 01:35:35,760
My only worry is, how to
save Shivani from him.

1854
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:40,480
Shivani calls you Dad,

1855
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:41,960
Akash calls me Mom,

1856
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:47,880
For this to come true even
your father wants this to happen.

1857
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:51,040
So is it just the kids
and my father!?

1858
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:25,920
"Why did love have
captured my entire heart"

1859
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:33,920
"Why did love have
captured my entire heart"

1860
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,960
"Flowers were forgotten"

1861
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,280
"Youth was lost"

1862
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:41,720
"Poetry is blossoming"

1863
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:43,600
"Is it a dream"

1864
01:36:43,640 --> 01:36:45,720
"Or reality"

1865
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:47,240
"Is it a dream"

1866
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:51,600
"Is it a dream"

1867
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:53,760
"Or reality"

1868
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:55,520
"Is it a dream"

1869
01:37:14,680 --> 01:37:20,560
"Bridges....our children
were a bridge to our love"

1870
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:22,600
"Just for us"

1871
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:30,160
"Will this beautiful
dream last..."

1872
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:32,200
"Holding our hands together.."

1873
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:34,200
"Looking into each other's eyes"

1874
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:38,600
"Is this the new found
love bloomed in our heart"

1875
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:40,840
"Wonder how we would
overcome this..."

1876
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:46,760
"Wonder what they're,
wonder what they're"

1877
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:55,120
"Why did love have
captured my entire heart"

1878
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:24,680
"I'm drowning in love..."

1879
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:28,800
"...as you get closer to me"

1880
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:36,280
"You're killing me with
your looks, Oh dear"

1881
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:40,680
"Hormones which were lost have
started to ravish me again"

1882
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:44,560
"It's not fair to kiss me"

1883
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:48,240
"I discovered myself once again"

1884
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:52,880
"Wonder how I did,
Wonder how I did"

1885
01:38:52,920 --> 01:39:00,400
"Why did love have
captured my entire heart"

1886
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:02,800
"Is it a dream"

1887
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:04,880
"Or Reality"

1888
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:06,560
"Is it a dream"

1889
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:13,760
Even the runaway couples are
on time for the wedding.

1890
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:16,720
But our Boss and Shivani's
mom are not on time.

1891
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:17,640
That's fine,

1892
01:39:17,680 --> 01:39:20,840
Boss and Shivani's mom are
getting married today.

1893
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:22,440
When is the Honey Bee?

1894
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:23,600
Honey Bee!?

1895
01:39:23,680 --> 01:39:26,200
The vacation tradition
of newly-weds.

1896
01:39:26,240 --> 01:39:27,560
That's not Honey Bee.

1897
01:39:27,640 --> 01:39:28,600
It's Guneymoon.

1898
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:29,360
That's better.

1899
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:31,560
Don't they go on Honeymoon
to start a family?

1900
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:33,280
But they have a family
already, why are they going?

1901
01:39:33,320 --> 01:39:35,880
Boss has a son, and
Ma'am has got daughter.

1902
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:38,560
But they don't have one together,
that's why they're going.

1903
01:39:40,120 --> 01:39:41,120
Mom!

1904
01:39:41,480 --> 01:39:43,160
- Mom.
- Yeah!?

1905
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:46,760
Mom, get ready soon.

1906
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:48,480
Everyone is on the way.

1907
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:49,680
I'm almost done.

1908
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:51,640
We're leaving grandpa.

1909
01:40:02,640 --> 01:40:03,440
Shivani!

1910
01:40:06,280 --> 01:40:07,400
Shivani!

1911
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:10,840
Shivani!

1912
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:20,320
Shivani!

1913
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:23,400
Shivani!

1914
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:24,400
Mummy!

1915
01:40:26,680 --> 01:40:28,400
Mummy!

1916
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:29,760
Mummy.

1917
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:31,400
- Shivani!
- Mummy.

1918
01:40:32,120 --> 01:40:33,080
Shivani!

1919
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:35,600
Shivani!

1920
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:38,120
Shivani!

1921
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:42,040
Sanjay,

1922
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:43,440
let my child go.

1923
01:40:43,480 --> 01:40:44,440
Your child!?

1924
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:45,800
Say it's our child.

1925
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:47,120
You're going to get
married right?

1926
01:40:47,160 --> 01:40:47,760
Leave.

1927
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:51,920
By the time you're done with
wedding, we'll be in Calcutta.

1928
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:52,960
You...

1929
01:40:57,760 --> 01:40:59,240
Hey. Let go!

1930
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:00,400
Let go!

1931
01:41:02,280 --> 01:41:04,880
Doesn't matter who you marry.
It's your will.

1932
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:06,200
I won't stop you.

1933
01:41:07,400 --> 01:41:10,560
But to meet my child, why should
I get a permission for someone?

1934
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:12,080
It's not possible.

1935
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:17,720
Hey the groom is here.

1936
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:19,000
Hey guys run to him.

1937
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:21,880
Boss, don't be in a hurry,
the bride isn't here yet.

1938
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:22,440
Not yet?

1939
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:25,240
- I just the bride walk in.
- That's not her idiot.

1940
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:27,440
Boss, don't be in a hurry,
the bride isn't here yet.

1941
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:28,720
Am I not saying the same thing?

1942
01:41:28,760 --> 01:41:30,840
Boss, don't be in a hurry,
the bride isn't here yet.

1943
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:32,000
Then what about that bride?

1944
01:41:32,040 --> 01:41:33,240
- Hey
- Hey!

1945
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:34,640
You guys don't stop do you?

1946
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,600
Grandpa, mom is calling.

1947
01:41:37,640 --> 01:41:38,320
Oh!

1948
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:40,880
Tell me dear.

1949
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:41,600
Uncle.

1950
01:41:42,240 --> 01:41:44,320
I won't be able to make
it for the wedding.

1951
01:41:44,360 --> 01:41:45,160
Sorry.

1952
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:48,240
What are you saying?

1953
01:41:48,280 --> 01:41:51,760
You're not a guest to
apologize for making it.

1954
01:41:51,960 --> 01:41:52,760
You're the Bride.

1955
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:55,760
I'm in a situation,
where I can't make it.

1956
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:57,240
Call off the wedding.

1957
01:41:58,160 --> 01:41:59,040
Hello!

1958
01:41:59,080 --> 01:41:59,880
Hello!

1959
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:07,280
What's it Dad?

1960
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:11,920
She's saying that can't
make it to the wedding.

1961
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,360
Some issue it seems.

1962
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:17,600
Issues are bound to
arise after marriage.

1963
01:42:17,640 --> 01:42:18,920
It was like that for me.

1964
01:42:19,880 --> 01:42:21,000
Don't really know when to...

1965
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:24,200
Hey Baskar, hearing
on what she said,

1966
01:42:24,240 --> 01:42:26,240
she's in a situation, where
she can't make it here now.

1967
01:42:26,280 --> 01:42:28,400
So what if she can't come
here, let's go there.

1968
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:29,160
Hey Arnold!

1969
01:42:29,200 --> 01:42:30,640
Understood Boss, let's
nab everything.

1970
01:42:30,680 --> 01:42:32,840
This guy never ceases
to show his biceps.

1971
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:34,520
He looks like a mongoose.

1972
01:42:34,920 --> 01:42:36,960
Sir, we're transforming
you from this job...

1973
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:37,560
Huh!?

1974
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:38,640
Doesn't understand
English I think.

1975
01:42:38,680 --> 01:42:40,000
We're going to take
you away from here.

1976
01:42:40,040 --> 01:42:41,720
That won't be possible.

1977
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:43,720
Then you pick him up.

1978
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:44,440
Look here.

1979
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:47,040
I'm a law abiding citizen.

1980
01:42:47,080 --> 01:42:52,880
That's why no one could take me
off this chair for past 25 years.

1981
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:54,600
So they can't take you
off the chair right?

1982
01:42:54,640 --> 01:42:55,800
Then pick him up along
with the chair.

1983
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:00,520
- He's so heavy.
- Bit to your left...

1984
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:01,880
- He seems comfy...
- Go to your left.

1985
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:02,960
Keep going.

1986
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:04,360
Put him down there.

1987
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:08,080
Hey, we're at a different house.
Wrong number, Wrong Number.

1988
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:10,760
Hey are you drunk, why are
blabbering like this?

1989
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:12,760
- We're at the wrong house.
- Sorry Sir.

1990
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:13,840
We're at the wrong house.

1991
01:43:13,880 --> 01:43:15,760
Oh no, we're at the wrong house
Sorry sir.

1992
01:43:15,800 --> 01:43:16,880
- Lift him up.
- Sorry again.

1993
01:43:16,920 --> 01:43:18,080
Keep going.

1994
01:43:18,120 --> 01:43:19,080
Hey wait.

1995
01:43:19,120 --> 01:43:20,040
This is the house.

1996
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:21,600
Look there's a picture of that kid.

1997
01:43:21,640 --> 01:43:22,880
That's her not a picture.

1998
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:24,400
- Get back to the position.
- Is that so?

1999
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:26,560
- Then move backwards.
- Put him down here.

2000
01:43:26,600 --> 01:43:27,680
Hey who are you guys?

2001
01:43:27,720 --> 01:43:29,040
We're from the Groom's side.

2002
01:43:29,080 --> 01:43:30,120
He's "Regi- bis- ter".

2003
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:31,000
An officer.

2004
01:43:31,040 --> 01:43:32,120
Name is Alagu Sundaram.

2005
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:34,400
Just the name, he's isn't.

2006
01:43:34,440 --> 01:43:35,800
That's fine, who are you?

2007
01:43:35,880 --> 01:43:38,400
Hey, he's from the Bride's side.

2008
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:39,720
Then it's fine.

2009
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:41,840
Why are you guys making noise?

2010
01:43:41,880 --> 01:43:43,920
Nothing Boss, register
office is ready,

2011
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:44,760
registrar is ready,

2012
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:47,760
- If the bride and groom are here,
- Then marriage will be ready too.

2013
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:49,480
Hey call Baskar.

2014
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:50,160
Come on.

2015
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:53,480
Boss!

2016
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:55,400
Come out soon, the auspicious
time is about to get over.

2017
01:43:55,480 --> 01:43:56,680
Why are screaming like an Iyer?

2018
01:43:56,720 --> 01:43:58,760
Your good time will start
once you're married.

2019
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:01,960
Fine, get to the house and check on other
things, I'll get back after wedding.

2020
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:02,960
You're...

2021
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:04,960
I'm M.A.M Rangasami.

2022
01:44:05,080 --> 01:44:07,280
I'm getting my son
married to Anu.

2023
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:08,640
You're...

2024
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,920
Why don't you ask Any who I am?

2025
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:18,560
He's...Shivani's father.

2026
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:44,560
You refused to get
married fearing him?

2027
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:48,080
We'll get married right
in front of you.

2028
01:44:48,120 --> 01:44:49,800
I'm going to get
married legally.

2029
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:52,640
- Registrar take out that book,
- It's ready...

2030
01:44:52,680 --> 01:44:55,400
But I need to ask few
question as per the rules...

2031
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:57,120
I was speaking generally,

2032
01:44:57,160 --> 01:44:59,600
There's no legality
when it comes to you.

2033
01:45:03,480 --> 01:45:06,720
Baskar I don't
want this marriage.

2034
01:45:11,240 --> 01:45:11,920
What!?

2035
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:14,520
You don't want this marriage?

2036
01:45:14,840 --> 01:45:16,760
Now she's rejecting you.

2037
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:18,160
Why don't you get out then?

2038
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:21,640
Baskar, don't
create any problems.

2039
01:45:21,720 --> 01:45:23,760
Please Baskar, listen to me...

2040
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:25,080
Uncle please tell him.

2041
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:29,160
Let him go, Let him go!

2042
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:31,680
It's not a matter to be
settled with a fight.

2043
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:33,360
It's marriage.

2044
01:45:34,680 --> 01:45:35,840
Hey Baskar

2045
01:45:36,040 --> 01:45:36,840
Get out.

2046
01:45:37,480 --> 01:45:38,240
Get out!

2047
01:45:47,120 --> 01:45:47,760
Dear...

2048
01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:50,000
...sorry dear.

2049
01:45:50,640 --> 01:45:51,360
Son...

2050
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:57,840
- First take him home.
- Ok boss.

2051
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:02,920
I thought he's on Bride's
side, but he's the husband.

2052
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:08,520
Listen carefully.

2053
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:11,840
The minute Bride and Groom
get out of the car,

2054
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:12,600
don't get to eat.

2055
01:46:12,640 --> 01:46:14,320
- Arnold!
- Rocky!

2056
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:17,080
Once they're out,
the crackers should start.

2057
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:19,560
Why do we need a Bihari
to burst crackers?

2058
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:20,760
What about the band then?

2059
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:21,800
Nah, he's not from Bihar.

2060
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:23,400
He's a Nepali.

2061
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:25,400
- Nepali!?
- What do you expect?

2062
01:46:25,480 --> 01:46:29,360
Right from laying roads till star
hotels, have employed northerners.

2063
01:46:29,440 --> 01:46:31,160
So you've decided not
to employ the locals.

2064
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:32,480
Even if we do, you don't work.

2065
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:34,120
Instead make your
employer work for you.

2066
01:46:34,160 --> 01:46:35,280
I'll come to you.

2067
01:46:35,400 --> 01:46:36,760
Listen closely.

2068
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:38,000
Crackers should go...

2069
01:46:39,400 --> 01:46:40,080
Stop!

2070
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:41,840
Then the Band will go...

2071
01:46:41,880 --> 01:46:42,560
Start!

2072
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:44,920
If at all you miss the timing,

2073
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:47,000
- There's no money.
- You don't have money?

2074
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:47,920
No money.

2075
01:46:47,960 --> 01:46:49,720
There's no money, let's leave.

2076
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:50,880
Why are they leaving?

2077
01:46:50,920 --> 01:46:52,280
Hey stop right there.

2078
01:46:52,360 --> 01:46:54,480
There's money not to worry.

2079
01:46:54,520 --> 01:46:55,160
There's money.

2080
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:57,000
Hey Rocky, how do we
make them understand?

2081
01:46:57,040 --> 01:46:59,000
Hey Japanese, listen
to this one last time.

2082
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:01,080
Once the crackers start to
burst, should stop the band.

2083
01:47:01,120 --> 01:47:03,720
Once the band is on,
crackers should stop.

2084
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:04,600
It's like this...

2085
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:08,200
What are you trying to say?

2086
01:47:08,240 --> 01:47:09,120
He's speaking in Tamil.

2087
01:47:09,160 --> 01:47:11,160
We'll stop the crackers,
and will play the band.

2088
01:47:11,200 --> 01:47:13,400
Once the band stops,
we'll burst crackers.

2089
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:14,080
Is that enough?

2090
01:47:14,160 --> 01:47:15,680
And you're complicating it.

2091
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:31,120
Which lunatic is
bursting crackers here?

2092
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:33,720
Aren't we suppose to burst crackers
when the newly-weds arrive?

2093
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:34,920
The wedding was called off.

2094
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:36,280
The wedding was called off?

2095
01:47:36,360 --> 01:47:37,840
Hey stop that.

2096
01:47:37,880 --> 01:47:38,840
Hey you stop that.

2097
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:41,520
We can call off a wedding,
but not the crackers.

2098
01:47:41,560 --> 01:47:42,320
Pour water on it.

2099
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:43,960
They did start with that.

2100
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,040
Stop that, Stop that.

2101
01:47:45,160 --> 01:47:47,080
Hey Bihari, come
here with the water.

2102
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:48,720
Run fast and get water.

2103
01:47:48,760 --> 01:47:49,800
Stop that, stop that.

2104
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:51,520
Give me that, come on.

2105
01:47:51,960 --> 01:47:53,880
You moron, giving me
crackers instead of water.

2106
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:54,920
I'll kill you.

2107
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:56,520
You threw crackers
into it again.

2108
01:47:56,560 --> 01:47:57,640
Oh no!

2109
01:47:58,400 --> 01:48:00,000
Crackers, Crackers, Crackers!

2110
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:01,200
Come on pour water on it.

2111
01:48:01,240 --> 01:48:02,400
Pour...

2112
01:48:02,440 --> 01:48:05,560
What are you doing?
Are you sprinkling it?

2113
01:48:05,640 --> 01:48:07,240
Pour it like this, idiot.

2114
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:09,120
Sprinkling it seems, pour it.

2115
01:48:10,680 --> 01:48:12,760
Phew! thank god.

2116
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,360
Now they've started.

2117
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:19,880
Once the crackers stopped,
they've started the band.

2118
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:22,200
- Boss...
- What's all this?

2119
01:48:22,240 --> 01:48:23,200
It's my hero's song.

2120
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:25,520
How's my dance boss?

2121
01:48:25,560 --> 01:48:26,240
Stop it!

2122
01:48:26,320 --> 01:48:27,160
Hey stop playing.

2123
01:48:27,200 --> 01:48:29,480
- Did you call me boss?
- Ask them to stop.

2124
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:30,720
Brainless Arnold!

2125
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:33,240
What hell are you doing dancing?
stop it.

2126
01:48:33,320 --> 01:48:34,400
Stop it.

2127
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:36,240
Stop it, Stop it.

2128
01:48:36,600 --> 01:48:37,920
- Stop it.
- Give me that.

2129
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:39,280
As if he's a musical genius.

2130
01:48:39,320 --> 01:48:40,560
Won't stop at once.

2131
01:48:41,960 --> 01:48:42,880
Stop it!

2132
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:44,120
Was the timing right?

2133
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:45,720
Hey shorty, don't sass us.

2134
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:46,640
You're timing was off.

2135
01:48:46,680 --> 01:48:47,680
- Hey.
- Yes boss.

2136
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:49,480
- Ask them to leave.
- As you command.

2137
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:51,800
Everyone leave from here.

2138
01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:53,520
Boss!

2139
01:48:53,560 --> 01:48:54,120
Fatty run.

2140
01:48:54,200 --> 01:48:56,040
Boss, please forgive us.

2141
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:58,080
This is the first time,
you're getting married twice.

2142
01:48:58,160 --> 01:49:00,240
So we wanted it to be
a memorable one, that's why.

2143
01:49:00,280 --> 01:49:01,520
The timing was little off.

2144
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:02,760
Please forgive us boss.

2145
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:04,040
Please tell us that
you've forgiven us.

2146
01:49:04,120 --> 01:49:05,520
Hey, he left long time back.

2147
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:07,120
He left uh!?

2148
01:49:08,200 --> 01:49:09,720
- Who's that?
- Whose vehicle is this?

2149
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:11,320
Is it the caterers?

2150
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:16,800
Why did you bring him here?

2151
01:49:16,840 --> 01:49:18,800
Boss did ask him to get home.

2152
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:20,840
Why did he ask this
Mongoose to get here?

2153
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:23,680
That's what I've been
asking since morning.

2154
01:49:23,720 --> 01:49:27,280
This drunkard is not
giving me an answer.

2155
01:49:29,360 --> 01:49:30,960
Hey, Rocky!

2156
01:49:31,040 --> 01:49:34,480
- Boss!
- Just 5 seconds, I'll be back.

2157
01:49:34,760 --> 01:49:36,200
Did you call me boss?

2158
01:49:36,240 --> 01:49:37,560
Who did this?

2159
01:49:37,600 --> 01:49:39,600
- It was him.
- Ask this drunkard.

2160
01:49:39,680 --> 01:49:41,480
Hey, Hey remove everything
and throw it away.

2161
01:49:41,560 --> 01:49:42,440
Ok Boss.

2162
01:49:44,440 --> 01:49:45,800
This happened itself.

2163
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:47,400
Which didn't burst
then is lit now.

2164
01:49:47,480 --> 01:49:49,960
Don't worry boss, this won't
be added to the list.

2165
01:49:50,040 --> 01:49:51,360
Oh no!

2166
01:49:52,280 --> 01:49:53,440
Is this playing itself too?

2167
01:49:53,480 --> 01:49:55,440
Not itself, it was
him who asked to.

2168
01:49:55,520 --> 01:49:57,120
It's been paid for,
didn't want it go waste.

2169
01:49:57,160 --> 01:49:58,080
Let them play...

2170
01:49:58,160 --> 01:49:59,320
Hey, first ask them to stop.

2171
01:49:59,360 --> 01:50:01,040
- Ok boss.
- Leave you guys.

2172
01:50:01,400 --> 01:50:02,640
Hey stop it.

2173
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:03,560
Stop it!

2174
01:50:03,600 --> 01:50:04,560
Stop it!

2175
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:06,120
Was the timing right?

2176
01:50:06,160 --> 01:50:07,560
Oh God!

2177
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:09,000
You happy!?

2178
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:12,120
We're very happy, please leave.

2179
01:50:17,080 --> 01:50:17,920
Sir!

2180
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,720
When will you let me go?

2181
01:50:20,760 --> 01:50:22,640
I'm a government officer.

2182
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:24,120
During the Bribe break...

2183
01:50:24,160 --> 01:50:28,080
I won't put even one
signature during lunch break.

2184
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:32,480
Why did you bring him here?

2185
01:50:32,520 --> 01:50:34,000
You did ask him to get home.

2186
01:50:34,040 --> 01:50:36,560
I asked to take
him to his house.

2187
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:37,680
You should've been
clear about it.

2188
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:39,920
I've been telling
this since morning.

2189
01:50:39,960 --> 01:50:42,960
He's drunk and have been
doing everything wrong.

2190
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:44,240
Just go and drop him.

2191
01:50:47,320 --> 01:50:48,560
It still working?

2192
01:50:48,640 --> 01:50:51,120
The crackers have
stopped, start the music.

2193
01:50:55,960 --> 01:50:58,480
- They started once again...
- That's right...

2194
01:50:58,520 --> 01:51:00,480
These guys...
Don't leave them...

2195
01:51:00,600 --> 01:51:03,200
Just 'cause they've been
paid, don't seem to stop.

2196
01:51:03,240 --> 01:51:06,560
Where's that cane?
Just wait and see.

2197
01:51:28,200 --> 01:51:29,120
Akash.

2198
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:34,840
Stop there.

2199
01:51:36,520 --> 01:51:37,800
Did I go behind her?

2200
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:40,560
She wanted to be your mother.

2201
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:43,160
Didn't she say?

2202
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:47,000
Then why did she
insult everyone?

2203
01:51:55,920 --> 01:51:56,840
Come here.

2204
01:52:02,120 --> 01:52:04,640
You're embarrassed to
call me your dad, right?

2205
01:52:09,680 --> 01:52:10,800
You don't like me.

2206
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:15,920
But I like you.

2207
01:52:18,200 --> 01:52:19,720
You're my...

2208
01:52:21,240 --> 01:52:22,000
...life!

2209
01:52:25,960 --> 01:52:29,160
You did ask the other day,
if she is like your mother?

2210
01:52:32,040 --> 01:52:34,080
No one can be like your mother.

2211
01:52:37,240 --> 01:52:41,120
The truth about she would die after
delivery, she hid that from all us.

2212
01:52:42,800 --> 01:52:45,120
She gave birth to
you, just for me.

2213
01:52:49,200 --> 01:52:51,800
She was in love with you,
even before you were born.

2214
01:52:56,160 --> 01:52:58,600
No one can be like your mother.

2215
01:53:06,480 --> 01:53:07,600
I'm a hot head.

2216
01:53:08,960 --> 01:53:10,240
Uneducated Rascal.

2217
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,160
But will never fail to
keep my word unlike her.

2218
01:53:17,320 --> 01:53:18,160
Here on...

2219
01:53:18,200 --> 01:53:20,400
...if you come with
someone calling Mom,

2220
01:53:20,440 --> 01:53:21,600
then I'll be pissed.

2221
01:53:22,600 --> 01:53:23,640
Goodnight.

2222
01:53:35,480 --> 01:53:39,200
Hence we can't make my dad
and your mother join together

2223
01:53:57,640 --> 01:53:59,480
Why do you guys
have a long face?

2224
01:53:59,920 --> 01:54:01,480
We've come to a decision.

2225
01:54:02,520 --> 01:54:04,320
You and mom will be
going to Canada.

2226
01:54:06,360 --> 01:54:07,440
You'll be going.

2227
01:54:10,600 --> 01:54:12,960
Let your grandparents
know about everything.

2228
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:14,640
Once you guys are back...

2229
01:54:14,680 --> 01:54:16,720
...we all will live together.

2230
01:54:17,920 --> 01:54:19,840
- Thank you Dad.
- Thank you Mom.

2231
01:54:34,600 --> 01:54:38,000
"A 'To-let' board
at Thookanangoodu"

2232
01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:41,400
"Check if it's still hanging,
if then live there for a day"

2233
01:54:41,680 --> 01:54:45,520
"Granny's earrings are
dancing to a tune"

2234
01:54:45,560 --> 01:54:48,640
"Sing an awesome song,
pleasing the ears."

2235
01:54:48,720 --> 01:54:52,920
"Our paths are getting
separated..."

2236
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:56,920
"Will they cross each
other tomorrow?"

2237
01:55:33,040 --> 01:55:36,360
"Eyes been painting
a graffiti of love"

2238
01:55:36,440 --> 01:55:40,440
"But the time is painting
a different graffiti"

2239
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:44,080
"My heart is always
longing for it"

2240
01:55:44,120 --> 01:55:48,040
"It's been playing
hide and seek"

2241
01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:51,680
"The climate here is changing"

2242
01:55:51,720 --> 01:55:55,280
"The clouds of
happiness are leaving"

2243
01:55:55,360 --> 01:55:58,920
"They are leaving..."

2244
01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:00,920
"At dawn you'll be in
a different country,"

2245
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:03,400
"and we'll be strangers"

2246
01:56:04,840 --> 01:56:08,280
"A 'To-let' board

2247
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:12,160
"Check if it's still hanging,
if then live there for a day"

2248
01:56:48,440 --> 01:56:52,160
"Like the birds who fly
from one place to another"

2249
01:56:52,200 --> 01:56:56,240
"Just like the relationships
which come looking for you."

2250
01:56:56,280 --> 01:56:59,920
"Small and beautiful
flowers are dancing"

2251
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:03,640
"But the blue sky
is covering them"

2252
01:57:03,680 --> 01:57:07,120
"Is it a garden of moons"

2253
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:11,200
"Why there's a change
in heart, why is that?"

2254
01:57:11,280 --> 01:57:13,680
"Why is that?"

2255
01:57:14,640 --> 01:57:19,040
"There's nothing which
can cut through air"

"Check if it's still hanging,

2258
01:57:51,920 --> 01:57:52,800
Look...

2259
01:57:53,320 --> 01:57:55,160
...the kids look so happy.

2260
01:57:57,880 --> 01:58:00,040
But, I don't know once
I reach Canada...

2261
01:58:00,080 --> 01:58:02,080
...how to handle her.

2262
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:06,680
Thanks a lot for acting
this out for me.

2263
01:58:10,920 --> 01:58:13,440
It's easy to lie and act
in front of the adults.

2264
01:58:14,520 --> 01:58:16,480
It's hard to act in
front of the kids.

2265
01:58:26,960 --> 01:58:27,800
Hi!

2266
01:58:31,720 --> 01:58:33,360
Wait!

2267
01:58:33,400 --> 01:58:34,520
Wait Rabbit.

2268
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:36,400
Rabbit...wait!

2269
01:58:50,360 --> 01:58:51,360
Akash!

2270
01:58:51,400 --> 01:58:52,640
Where's Shivani?

2271
01:58:54,400 --> 01:58:55,360
She was right here.

2272
01:58:55,440 --> 01:58:57,800
You were playing along,
can't you look after her.

2273
01:58:59,120 --> 01:59:00,160
Shivani!

2274
01:59:00,240 --> 01:59:01,280
Shivani!

2275
01:59:01,320 --> 01:59:02,520
- Shivani!
- Shivani!

2276
01:59:03,800 --> 01:59:04,880
Shivani!

2277
01:59:18,640 --> 01:59:20,320
Sanjay, where's Shivani?

2278
01:59:20,360 --> 01:59:22,120
Shivani!? Why are you asking me?

2279
01:59:22,160 --> 01:59:23,160
I just got here.

2280
01:59:23,200 --> 01:59:24,240
Sanjay don't lie.

2281
01:59:24,280 --> 01:59:25,280
You must've done something.

2282
01:59:25,320 --> 01:59:26,680
I swear, I don't know.

2283
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:28,120
She must be somewhere here.

2284
01:59:28,160 --> 01:59:29,600
Come on, Shivani.

2285
01:59:31,680 --> 01:59:32,840
Shivani!

2286
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:34,200
Shivani!

2287
01:59:36,280 --> 01:59:37,160
Shivani!

2288
01:59:37,880 --> 01:59:38,800
Where's she?

2289
01:59:56,480 --> 01:59:59,080
Come on dear Anu, come in.

2290
02:00:00,200 --> 02:00:02,040
Did you come looking
for the child?

2291
02:00:02,200 --> 02:00:04,200
She came looking for a rabbit.

2292
02:00:04,720 --> 02:00:07,440
You both have come
to the right place.

2293
02:00:08,520 --> 02:00:09,480
Shivani!

2294
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:10,400
Huh!?

2295
02:00:11,600 --> 02:00:14,400
The name is as beautiful as her.

2296
02:00:28,440 --> 02:00:30,480
What are you looking at?

2297
02:00:30,520 --> 02:00:32,640
Tell Anu who I am.

2298
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:35,920
Won't you tell her?

2299
02:00:35,960 --> 02:00:37,120
Ok.

2300
02:00:37,240 --> 02:00:38,480
I'll tell her myself.

2301
02:00:40,080 --> 02:00:41,200
Anu...

2302
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:46,160
...I'm that unlucky
father of this criminal.

2303
02:00:46,600 --> 02:00:48,240
She is his mother.

2304
02:00:49,280 --> 02:00:52,960
We got here, once we came
to know you guys are here.

2305
02:00:59,120 --> 02:01:00,200
Dear...

2306
02:01:01,240 --> 02:01:03,280
For the mistake
committed by my son...

2307
02:01:03,360 --> 02:01:07,880
...we apologize to you
and our granddaughter.

2308
02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:09,400
Shivani, come.

2309
02:01:09,440 --> 02:01:11,720
Hey, she's my granddaughter.

2310
02:01:12,520 --> 02:01:14,640
You got her here
like a kidnapper.

2311
02:01:14,720 --> 02:01:17,040
Do you know how long we've
been looking for her.

2312
02:01:17,120 --> 02:01:18,760
Hey, I'm her grandfather.

2313
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:20,640
You can take all
that and dump it.

2314
02:01:21,680 --> 02:01:22,840
Anu come.

2315
02:01:23,520 --> 02:01:24,440
Come!

2316
02:01:29,360 --> 02:01:30,640
Who's he?

2317
02:01:30,680 --> 02:01:32,600
Are you trying to
cheat me again?

2318
02:01:33,480 --> 02:01:34,360
Kishore.

2319
02:01:34,440 --> 02:01:35,720
Why should I cheat you?

2320
02:01:36,440 --> 02:01:37,400
He's trouble.

2321
02:01:37,960 --> 02:01:40,560
Until he's there
I can't do anything.

2322
02:01:44,640 --> 02:01:49,400
So he's the problem, then
he would no longer be.

2323
02:02:40,320 --> 02:02:44,200
"Baskar...he is the Rascal"

2324
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,400
"Baskar...he is the Rascal"

2325
02:03:24,040 --> 02:03:25,320
You're sending men to hit me.

2326
02:03:25,360 --> 02:03:26,960
How dare you lay hands
on me on my turf.

2327
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:30,680
What's your relationship
with this house?

2328
02:03:30,720 --> 02:03:32,360
Why are you creating
problems here?

2329
02:03:32,400 --> 02:03:33,880
Who is creating problems?

2330
02:03:33,960 --> 02:03:36,320
It's you and your son, who
have been creating problems.

2331
02:03:36,360 --> 02:03:37,720
Sending the weakest...

2332
02:03:37,760 --> 02:03:39,720
If you want to hit me,
send stronger men.

2333
02:03:39,760 --> 02:03:41,160
If not, I'll come
over to your place.

2334
02:03:41,200 --> 02:03:43,720
Oh, you must be
a big gangster then?

2335
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:46,560
This is our family's issue.

2336
02:03:46,640 --> 02:03:50,080
We came down to take
our granddaughter and daughter-in-law.

2337
02:03:50,160 --> 02:03:51,080
Dad!

2338
02:03:53,360 --> 02:03:54,560
- Shivani!
- Hey.

2339
02:03:55,320 --> 02:03:58,080
Don't lay your hands on the kid, if
not will make you guys disappear.

2340
02:03:58,160 --> 02:04:00,720
Who the hell are
you to say that?

2341
02:04:00,760 --> 02:04:02,920
I'm your Rascal...

2342
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:05,000
- Baskar.
- Baskar.

2343
02:04:05,560 --> 02:04:06,800
Salim stop.

2344
02:04:08,400 --> 02:04:09,840
I'm sorry Baskar.

2345
02:04:09,880 --> 02:04:11,200
Dad got a bit emotional.

2346
02:04:12,880 --> 02:04:14,560
I've already told you...

2347
02:04:14,600 --> 02:04:16,360
...let my wife and kid go.

2348
02:04:16,440 --> 02:04:17,640
Who's you wife?

2349
02:04:18,080 --> 02:04:19,400
Did you marry her?

2350
02:04:20,520 --> 02:04:24,040
Betraying a girl and getting her
pregnant isn't being a husband.

2351
02:04:24,080 --> 02:04:24,960
Rascal!

2352
02:04:27,080 --> 02:04:27,960
Sanjay!

2353
02:04:28,840 --> 02:04:29,880
Stop it!

2354
02:04:31,240 --> 02:04:33,200
For god sake, can
everyone leave from here.

2355
02:04:33,240 --> 02:04:34,880
Let me be in peace for a while.

2356
02:04:35,760 --> 02:04:36,520
Shivani come.

2357
02:04:37,320 --> 02:04:39,520
Why is everyone
torturing me like this?

2358
02:04:40,680 --> 02:04:42,080
Didn't I ask you to come up?

2359
02:04:42,200 --> 02:04:43,000
Go.

2360
02:04:47,440 --> 02:04:51,720
From the day she called Dad,
since then she's my daughter.

2361
02:04:58,640 --> 02:05:01,520
Dad, mom didn't ask us
to leave but to them.

2362
02:05:01,640 --> 02:05:03,000
She's a poor thing.

2363
02:05:03,040 --> 02:05:05,000
She screamed at us,
out of frustration.

2364
02:05:05,520 --> 02:05:06,840
- Don't take it wrong.
- No dear...

2365
02:05:06,920 --> 02:05:08,360
She asked us to leave too.

2366
02:05:08,400 --> 02:05:09,160
No Dad.

2367
02:05:09,200 --> 02:05:12,080
Just wait and watch, Mom will
come to the balcony and see us.

2368
02:05:18,360 --> 02:05:19,200
Akash.

2369
02:05:20,320 --> 02:05:21,800
Get inside the car.

2370
02:06:06,160 --> 02:06:07,880
Boy are not suppose to cry.

2371
02:06:12,720 --> 02:06:13,600
Look here.

2372
02:06:13,680 --> 02:06:16,520
Let's not give up on Mom
and Shivani for anyone.

2373
02:06:17,440 --> 02:06:19,680
Hey, I spoke out of
anger the other day.

2374
02:06:19,720 --> 02:06:21,040
Don't take that to your heart.

2375
02:06:21,120 --> 02:06:22,480
I'm here right.

2376
02:06:22,520 --> 02:06:24,080
Shivani's mom is yours too.

2377
02:06:24,920 --> 02:06:25,880
Don't cry.

2378
02:06:26,520 --> 02:06:28,440
I wasn't crying thinking of Mom.

2379
02:06:29,360 --> 02:06:31,040
I was crying thinking of you.

2380
02:06:31,440 --> 02:06:32,320
Why?

2381
02:06:32,600 --> 02:06:34,640
You're going through a lot
and getting insulted,

2382
02:06:34,680 --> 02:06:36,840
just 'cause I wished
to be with mom.

2383
02:06:37,360 --> 02:06:39,240
But mom doesn't like you.

2384
02:06:39,640 --> 02:06:42,800
Here on, I don't want the Mom
who doesn't like you.

2385
02:06:43,960 --> 02:06:45,520
I love you, Dad!

2386
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:49,960
If you don't want
it, then I do too.

2387
02:06:50,480 --> 02:06:52,560
We're there for each other.

2388
02:06:52,640 --> 02:06:53,760
That's enough.

2389
02:06:55,880 --> 02:06:57,400
Boys don't cry.

2390
02:07:00,560 --> 02:07:03,240
I've to get settled in
Canada with my parents.

2391
02:07:03,320 --> 02:07:04,240
How's that possible?

2392
02:07:04,280 --> 02:07:06,240
You and my kid should
be here with me.

2393
02:07:06,320 --> 02:07:08,000
That will never happen.

2394
02:07:08,040 --> 02:07:08,680
Anu!

2395
02:07:09,880 --> 02:07:10,920
Sanjay!

2396
02:07:15,200 --> 02:07:18,200
Isn't it enough you've
tortured all these years?

2397
02:07:19,440 --> 02:07:20,360
Sorry dear.

2398
02:07:20,440 --> 02:07:21,240
Sorry.

2399
02:07:22,040 --> 02:07:24,040
Let them go to Canada.

2400
02:07:24,080 --> 02:07:27,440
Eventually she might have
a change of heart and return.

2401
02:07:28,440 --> 02:07:29,480
You leave.

2402
02:07:30,200 --> 02:07:34,680
But before you leave,
just once visit Calcutta.

2403
02:07:35,440 --> 02:07:37,120
I did say that's not possible.

2404
02:07:37,160 --> 02:07:38,160
Anu.

2405
02:07:38,600 --> 02:07:40,160
Don't say such things.

2406
02:07:40,200 --> 02:07:42,480
Our lives are in your hand now.

2407
02:07:44,880 --> 02:07:46,120
That one thing he did...

2408
02:07:47,120 --> 02:07:47,880
Salim.

2409
02:07:47,920 --> 02:07:48,480
Sir!

2410
02:07:57,760 --> 02:07:59,880
That one mistake done by him,

2411
02:07:59,920 --> 02:08:03,400
has put everyone's
life in danger.

2412
02:08:05,280 --> 02:08:06,280
Now...

2413
02:08:06,360 --> 02:08:08,640
If you don't help us now,

2414
02:08:08,680 --> 02:08:12,320
those criminals will
definitely kill us.

2415
02:08:13,080 --> 02:08:14,920
I beg of you dear.

2416
02:08:15,560 --> 02:08:17,800
For god sake, come to Calcutta.

2417
02:08:20,560 --> 02:08:27,280
Seven years back, in Calcutta
he gave something to you...

2418
02:08:27,320 --> 02:08:29,760
...and have asked to keep
it inside a bank locker.

2419
02:08:31,080 --> 02:08:32,280
Is that true?

2420
02:08:33,120 --> 02:08:34,000
Huh!?

2421
02:08:48,600 --> 02:08:49,800
I'm sorry Anu.

2422
02:08:49,840 --> 02:08:52,600
When I had given that to
be kept in the locker...

2423
02:08:52,640 --> 02:08:54,120
...the importance of it,

2424
02:08:54,280 --> 02:08:56,880
Neither I mentioned it,
nor you asked for it.

2425
02:08:58,040 --> 02:08:59,760
Where's that now?

2426
02:09:00,040 --> 02:09:01,000
That...

2427
02:09:03,440 --> 02:09:05,200
...must be inside that locker.

2428
02:09:05,240 --> 02:09:08,520
That's the reason,
those guys shot him.

2429
02:09:08,560 --> 02:09:10,920
Then, the Police
and that gang...

2430
02:09:10,960 --> 02:09:14,160
...were torturing
them asking for it.

2431
02:09:17,920 --> 02:09:18,760
Anu.

2432
02:09:19,200 --> 02:09:20,040
Now...

2433
02:09:20,080 --> 02:09:23,440
That gang knows where you live.

2434
02:09:23,480 --> 02:09:25,880
They were the ones, who
attacked you guys today.

2435
02:09:26,440 --> 02:09:31,400
Before they cause danger
to you and your daughter.

2436
02:09:31,440 --> 02:09:34,200
Let's go there take that
and give it to them.

2437
02:09:34,680 --> 02:09:35,640
Understood!?

2438
02:09:44,440 --> 02:09:45,520
Shivani.

2439
02:09:48,280 --> 02:09:49,440
I'm leaving uncle.

2440
02:09:49,480 --> 02:09:50,360
Go safe.

2441
02:09:51,920 --> 02:09:52,840
Akash!

2442
02:09:55,840 --> 02:09:56,720
Take care.

2443
02:10:36,360 --> 02:10:38,200
- Shivani!
- Sanjay.

2444
02:10:39,400 --> 02:10:40,640
Shivani!

2445
02:10:40,720 --> 02:10:42,040
What are you doing?

2446
02:10:42,080 --> 02:10:43,240
Get inside the car.

2447
02:10:43,280 --> 02:10:44,120
I won't,

2448
02:10:44,160 --> 02:10:46,920
I will come, only if Akash
and Dad come along too.

2449
02:10:49,920 --> 02:10:50,800
Why do you need us?

2450
02:10:50,840 --> 02:10:52,880
You and Mom will be back
in two days from Canada.

2451
02:10:52,920 --> 02:10:54,720
No, we won't come back.

2452
02:10:54,760 --> 02:10:56,480
Mom is lying.

2453
02:11:01,080 --> 02:11:03,360
Shivani, are you
coming with us or not?

2454
02:11:04,360 --> 02:11:07,040
If you force me in to it,

2455
02:11:07,080 --> 02:11:09,040
then I'll runaway
from the airport.

2456
02:11:12,920 --> 02:11:14,400
Why are you troubling Mom?

2457
02:11:14,440 --> 02:11:15,280
Come.

2458
02:11:15,720 --> 02:11:19,200
Can't you and Akash, come
along with us until Calcutta?

2459
02:11:19,240 --> 02:11:21,720
At least I will get
two days with you.

2460
02:11:21,760 --> 02:11:24,000
Please Dad, please.

2461
02:11:24,040 --> 02:11:25,000
Shivani, please.

2462
02:11:25,520 --> 02:11:26,440
Let it go dear.

2463
02:11:26,960 --> 02:11:28,280
What are you thinking about?

2464
02:11:28,320 --> 02:11:30,120
It's just two days,
go and come back.

2465
02:11:30,720 --> 02:11:31,840
No Dad, I can't...

2466
02:11:31,880 --> 02:11:33,640
Hey, the kids want this.

2467
02:11:33,840 --> 02:11:34,560
Huh!?

2468
02:11:38,800 --> 02:11:39,480
Ok.

2469
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:43,280
Thank you Dad,
thank you so much.

2470
02:11:46,520 --> 02:11:47,600
Come.

2471
02:11:48,840 --> 02:11:50,160
Akash go.

2472
02:11:50,200 --> 02:11:52,200
- Ok grandpa.
- Akash come here.

2473
02:11:55,560 --> 02:11:56,680
Hey Akash.

2474
02:11:56,720 --> 02:11:58,840
Do you know why I made
you guys come along?

2475
02:11:58,880 --> 02:12:03,080
'Cause this is the last chance
to bring Mom and Dad together.

2476
02:12:03,160 --> 02:12:04,200
How's my plan?

2477
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:06,840
You plan really well.

2478
02:12:06,880 --> 02:12:08,800
But it's me and Dad who
get tangled in it.

2479
02:12:08,840 --> 02:12:10,040
Shut your mouth.

2480
02:12:10,080 --> 02:12:10,920
Dumbo!

2481
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,480
'Kolkata'

2482
02:12:28,120 --> 02:12:28,800
Stop.

2483
02:12:29,280 --> 02:12:32,080
Anu just the you go
inside and we'll wait here.

2484
02:12:41,080 --> 02:12:43,280
Hey, let's leave.

2485
02:12:49,960 --> 02:12:53,560
They'll miss the flight,
by the time they find us.

2486
02:12:53,600 --> 02:12:55,120
This is my plan.

2487
02:13:04,520 --> 02:13:05,480
Baskar.

2488
02:13:05,560 --> 02:13:06,760
Where are the kids?

2489
02:13:06,800 --> 02:13:07,720
They were here.

2490
02:13:09,040 --> 02:13:10,040
Shivani.

2491
02:13:10,080 --> 02:13:11,000
Akash.

2492
02:13:19,160 --> 02:13:20,000
Sanjay!?

2493
02:13:20,080 --> 02:13:20,680
Box!

2494
02:13:20,720 --> 02:13:21,600
What about the kids?

2495
02:13:21,680 --> 02:13:22,960
I don't care about the kids.

2496
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:23,840
Give me the box.

2497
02:13:23,880 --> 02:13:25,680
I won't give this
without the kids.

2498
02:13:26,640 --> 02:13:27,480
Let go!

2499
02:13:34,640 --> 02:13:35,200
Hello.

2500
02:13:35,240 --> 02:13:37,200
Sanjay don't be over smart.

2501
02:13:37,640 --> 02:13:39,000
The kids are with me.

2502
02:13:39,600 --> 02:13:41,800
You get the hard
disk and come here.

2503
02:13:41,840 --> 02:13:42,520
Come on.

2504
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:54,080
Give me the box dear.

2505
02:13:54,160 --> 02:13:55,120
Where are the kids?

2506
02:13:57,040 --> 02:13:58,000
Mummy!

2507
02:13:59,600 --> 02:14:00,480
Mummy!

2508
02:14:01,920 --> 02:14:03,320

2509
02:14:04,520 --> 02:14:05,880

2510
02:14:13,560 --> 02:14:15,600

2511
02:14:15,680 --> 02:14:16,960
Mummy!

2512
02:14:18,720 --> 02:14:19,920
Shivani

2513
02:14:20,280 --> 02:14:21,760

2514
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:25,920

2516
02:14:27,960 --> 02:14:29,120
Mummy!

2517
02:14:29,200 --> 02:14:30,240
Mummy!

2518
02:14:31,800 --> 02:14:32,920
Mummy!

2519
02:14:34,160 --> 02:14:35,480
Mummy!

2520
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:37,440
- Shivani!

2521
02:14:45,720 --> 02:14:47,520
You're fine, you're fine.

2522
02:16:49,200 --> 02:16:50,160
Mom!

2523
02:17:14,640 --> 02:17:15,680

02:17:30,040 --> 02:17:31,320
Dad!

2525
02:17:31,680 --> 02:17:32,800
Akash!

2526
02:17:32,840 --> 02:17:34,200
Sanjay let's not fight.

2527
02:17:34,960 --> 02:17:36,440
- Take care of him first.
- Fifty-Fifty!?

2528
02:17:36,520 --> 02:17:37,560
Done!

2529
02:17:39,200 --> 02:17:39,880

2530
02:17:39,960 --> 02:17:40,920

2531
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:42,040

2532
02:17:42,120 --> 02:17:43,160
Wake up mummy.

2533
02:17:43,200 --> 02:17:44,080
Dad.

2534
02:17:45,560 --> 02:17:46,840

2537
02:18:24,520 --> 02:18:25,840
Dad!

2538
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:34,640
DAD!

2539
02:18:54,280 --> 02:18:56,160
Shivani, Shivani...

2540
02:19:19,560 --> 02:19:20,680
No

2541
02:19:49,360 --> 02:19:51,960
"He is here to make ashes these demons"

2542
02:19:52,240 --> 02:19:54,920
"Though he is illiterate among the goons"

2543
02:19:55,040 --> 02:19:59,000
"Kick or bash them off
And send them to hell at once"

2544
02:20:59,280 --> 02:21:00,520
Sorry!

2545
02:21:13,880 --> 02:21:14,720
Boss!

2546
02:21:14,760 --> 02:21:16,320
- Please save us,
- Boss save us...

2547
02:21:16,440 --> 02:21:18,120
Boss, please save us.

2548
02:21:18,360 --> 02:21:19,120
Oh God!

2549
02:21:19,160 --> 02:21:21,360
You've forgotten about us,
since you're a family man.

2550
02:21:21,520 --> 02:21:22,560
Boss, please save us.

2551
02:21:22,600 --> 02:21:23,880
What's it? What happened?

2552
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,480
This moron Arnold, went and
picked a fight with few goons,

2553
02:21:26,520 --> 02:21:29,240
stating why they're
built up like pigs.

2554
02:21:29,280 --> 02:21:30,840
- Now they're looking to beat us up.
- Where did they go?

2555
02:21:30,880 --> 02:21:32,160
We've to break their bones.

2556
02:21:32,240 --> 02:21:33,800
I did that, as
you're there for us.

2557
02:21:33,880 --> 02:21:35,960
Didn't I say no to fights,
as we've become good now.

2558
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,320
Boss Jr. had asked to pick
a fight and get them to school.

2559
02:21:38,360 --> 02:21:39,160
Why are you pushing me?

2560
02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:41,200
He's right, I want
my old Dad back.

2561
02:21:41,280 --> 02:21:43,280
I don't want this
goody-goody Dad.

2562
02:21:47,160 --> 02:21:48,040
Correct!

2563
02:21:48,080 --> 02:21:51,840
If someone is heading to
beat you, the first punch...

2564
02:21:51,920 --> 02:21:53,080
They're there.

2565
02:21:53,120 --> 02:21:54,120
...should be ours.

2566
02:21:54,160 --> 02:21:57,200
"Hit, kick or slap vigorously"

2567
02:21:57,240 --> 02:22:00,200
"Don't play your tricks to me"

2568
02:22:05,200 --> 02:22:06,360
Come sweety.

2569
02:22:06,960 --> 02:22:08,040
Hey Baby!

2570
02:22:09,720 --> 02:22:10,760
Baskar!

2571
02:22:10,800 --> 02:22:12,480
Hey it's Boss Baskar.

2572
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:14,520
- I don't want to meet him.
- Why?

2573
02:22:14,560 --> 02:22:16,360
Now that you know, run.

2574
02:22:17,320 --> 02:22:18,640
No, let's not.

2575
02:22:18,680 --> 02:22:20,280
Ok, then I'll go and see him.

2576
02:22:20,920 --> 02:22:22,520
Hello Baskar.

2577
02:22:25,120 --> 02:22:26,200
Oh my God!

2578
02:22:26,240 --> 02:22:27,360
Hi Baskar.

2579
02:22:27,400 --> 02:22:28,400
We are married now.

2580
02:22:28,480 --> 02:22:29,680
It's all 'cause of you.

2581
02:22:29,720 --> 02:22:30,840
Thanks a lot.

2582
02:22:32,160 --> 02:22:33,720
Thank you so much, Baskar.

2583
02:22:33,760 --> 02:22:34,840
It's hot now.

2584
02:22:34,960 --> 02:22:36,400
- Boss
- Very nice meeting you.

2585
02:22:36,440 --> 02:22:40,040
When things are going smooth
her entry spoil the scenario again

2586
02:22:40,800 --> 02:22:42,240
Push her in to the water.

2587
02:22:42,320 --> 02:22:44,320
Boss always calls both of
them at the same time.

2588
02:22:44,360 --> 02:22:45,840
- Hey
- Give him a tight slap.

2589
02:22:45,880 --> 02:22:46,880
Hey Anu.

2590
02:22:47,480 --> 02:22:48,480
Anu!

2591
02:22:51,760 --> 02:22:52,880
Anu.

2592
02:22:52,960 --> 02:22:56,080
"Not sure if I'm a good person"

2593
02:22:56,120 --> 02:22:58,960
"Nor sure if I'm a bad person"

2594
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,920
"No idea if I'm a good boy"

2595
02:23:01,960 --> 02:23:04,600
"Baskar is a Rascal"

2596
02:23:04,640 --> 02:23:07,680
"Baskar is a Rascal"

2597
02:23:13,280 --> 02:23:16,000
"I'm built like a beast"

2598
02:23:16,040 --> 02:23:18,920
"But love is making
a deal with heart"

2599
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,880
"It's a deal
I'll never understand"

2600
02:23:21,920 --> 02:23:24,920
"I've mixed feelings"

2601
02:23:32,400 --> 02:23:35,160
"Baskar is a Rascal"

2602
02:23:35,200 --> 02:23:37,960
"Baskar is a Rascal"

2603
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,640
"Can you please
introduce me to myself"

2604

"Baskar is a Rascal"

2606
02:23:46,880 --> 02:23:49,400
"Baskar is a Rascal"

2607
02:23:49,440 --> 02:23:52,600
"This is a weird feeling"

2608
02:23:52,640 --> 02:23:55,160
"A deal which confuses you"

2609
02:23:55,520 --> 02:23:58,720
"Don't cry buddy,
Don't cry buddy"

2610
02:23:58,800 --> 02:24:01,080
"This is a strange
kind of feeling"

2611
02:24:01,120 --> 02:24:04,200
"Baskar is a Rascal"

2612
02:24:04,240 --> 02:24:06,760

"My personality has changed"

2615
02:24:33,160 --> 02:24:36,120
"2*2 = 4"

2616
02:24:36,200 --> 02:24:38,960
"Life will get
as cool as a Kulfi"

2617
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,880
"Knives and swords
will disappear"

2618
02:24:41,960 --> 02:24:44,440
"Life will take a new turn"

2619
02:24:44,480 --> 02:24:47,280
"Heart has started to long..."

2620
02:24:47,360 --> 02:24:50,440
"And is provoking to love..."

2621
02:24:50,520 --> 02:24:53,720
"You don't need this Boss"

2622
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:56,400
"Seems like you'll
lose your sanity"

2623
02:24:56,440 --> 02:24:59,240
"Baskar is a Rascal"

2624
02:24:59,320 --> 02:25:01,960
"Baskar is a Rascal"

2625
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,720
