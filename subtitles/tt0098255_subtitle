2
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:53,681
Glory to the Suttee!
Hail Suttee Hail!

3
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:32,323
She's got courage!
Hasn't made a sound

4
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:34,753
It's the opium.
She's drugged.

5
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:38,092
Gangacharafls niece had a
lucky escape!

6
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:40,667
She was about to marry
our corpse!

7
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,634
But how many of them
burn nowadays?

8
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:46,797
We're having a
Suttee after ages!

9
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:49,169
And that's only because
Major Sleeman wasn't around..

10
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:52,677
...when they went
for permission

11
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,406
They say that British
will ban it soon

12
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,012
Don't speak like atheist!

13
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,676
When has law ever ruled
Religion?

14
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,811
If a pious woman
wants to become a Suttee"

15
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:02,911
...there is no force
that can stop her!

16
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:06,048
Chant with me
Hail Suttee Hail!

17
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,826
O ye faithful
widows!

18
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:52,296
Ascend without tears
the pyre

19
00:03:52,398 --> 00:04:00,398
For she who joins
her lord in death

20
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:10,175
Earns the same
right to heaven

21
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:19,784
As the Holiest
of elibates

22
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:34,966
And earns the same
number of years in Heaven

23
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:48,584
As there are hairs
upon the human body

24
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,983
And like a
snake charmer

25
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,058
Draws her lord out
from the pits of Hell!

26
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,977
SUTTEE

27
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,578

Umi!
Just see if...

43
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,752
The stove has
only just been lit

44
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:47,693
When will the
cow be milked?

45
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:50,353
Are the children to have
some breakfast...

46
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:51,658
...or should they
just starve?

47
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:57,360
Talk of married bliss!

48
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:02,636
Came here as bride at nine. Have
I had a moment's peace since?

49
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,735
To top it all
there is this girl

50
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:09,543
She could not
get a groom in time

51
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:18,082
You'll die
an old maid!

52
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:40,712
Umi,
Umi?

53
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:48,620
Want to play
marbles today?

54
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:54,760
You stole auntie's bangles.
I saw you

55
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,734
If you play,
I won't tell Grandma

56
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:12,234
Just look at her
brandishing that broom!

57
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:15,610
Want to sweep
me out too?

58
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:26,387
I say this for your own good.
Get up early...

59
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:27,857
and finish
the chores

60
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,462
If you eat
<i>so</i> late everyday...

61
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:36,126
...you will fall sick,
Who will look after you then?

62
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:09,600
Hello Nabin.
Come and sit down

63
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:12,633
You have come
after a long time

64
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,266
He's too good for
the likes of us!

65
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,709
Will you write a
letter home for me?

66
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:20,677
I will

67
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:29,818
Isn't that Nabin?
I knew from his voice

68
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:34,382
How have you been?
Very well

69
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:41,732
We were <i>so</i> anxious.
You live all by yourself

70
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:44,769
Wondered if you were ill.
Time you brought your wife here

71
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:49,865
How long will you keep
her at her father's place?

72
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:54,577
You think, she will leave
her rich father and come here?

73
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:02,680
Well. She's an only child
and a city girl too

74
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,954
Ah! Here is Hari!

75
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:11,496
Hello Nabin!
Any news?

76
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:17,431
News" well, I met
the matchmaker yesterday

77
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:27,947
So? What did he say? Did the
groom's family like Shashi?

78
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:32,482
Well.. Yes"

79
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,791
What are you doing here?
Go inside at once!

80
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:47,294
But...

81
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:53,295
Until Umi marries...
We have tried enough!

82
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:55,669
Tell me,
who will marry a mute?

83
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:59,905
And with a horoscope
like hers!

84
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:04,347
Indicates widowhood

85
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:15,426
How much do they want
for Shashi?

86
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:20,756
That's the hitch
Now that Uma's marriage is off..

87
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:22,834
"The groom's family
have a lot to say...

88
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:26,997
"She is too old already"
"The village will boycott us"

89
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:29,734
And <i>so</i> on..
The usual excuses

90
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:31,776
in other words"

91
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:38,579
More money! Even that
could have been arranged

92
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,716
Just this morning
Mitter was talking...

93
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:46,918
"about a medium caste
Brahmin girl down town

94
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:49,393
Her father will pay well
for a high-caste groom

95
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:55,760
Kali has always been <i>so</i>
involved with his music

96
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:57,859
He's had no time
for marriage!

97
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:02,503
If he could only be persuaded
to marry soon...

98
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:04,975
...it might help the
family finances

99
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:14,715
Collections are not so good
from my in-laws anymore

100
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:19,690
Well.. the problem is Uma again
Not marrying in time!

101
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:24,628
Naturally! Family honour is
important to those who've money

102
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:29,028
What is family honour
in the face of love?

103
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:32,798
I have tossed it aside to
keep my tryst with Krishna

104
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:37,536
Can this wooden gate
hold me back?

105
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:44,515
I have crossed
an ocean of pride..

106
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:47,643
...to keep my tryst
with my beloved

107
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:50,415
Can this streamlet
put me out of my depths?

108
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:56,419
Stop"
Stop it Kali!

109
00:14:56,528 --> 00:15:01,022
I fear anything
could happen at his age!

110
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:02,760
He is too trail to go
collecting dues from in-laws!

111
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:06,463
Now our two sons
are our only hope

112
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,542
Please, Mother!
Don't include me..

113
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:12,043
Look to your older son!
He should marry again"

114
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:18,015
How about it, brother?
You're an old hand at it!

115
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:21,883
Be quiet,
you impudent boy!

116
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:26,584
Show me another
high-caste boy...

117
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,217
...sitting unmarried
like you!

118
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:32,829
You will die
bemoaning your fate

119
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,799
O, Radha!
Calling in vain upon Krishna

120
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:39,735
What shall we do Nabin?
What can we do?

121
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:44,036
She was born
unlucky!

122
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:45,008
Her mother died just
after her birth!

123
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,080
The groom died at the
mention of marriage

124
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,711
Just a few more days!
The old fool could have

125
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:57,813
...taken her to the
pyre with him

126
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:04,022
The lovely young bride!

127
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:07,622
How piously she burned with
him!

128
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:13,867
And you?

129
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:18,570
You could've a glorious death

130
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:22,511
To think we could have had a
suttee in the family

131
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:27,142
The honour of it would have
got a good groom for Shashi

132
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:29,947
Just our luck!

133
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:16,964
The lustre of your
beauty will soon fade

134
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:25,069
Your life will be
at stake

135
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:29,111
O Radha you will
perish soon a fear

136
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:33,208
Calling out in vain
upon Lord Krishna

137
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:37,312
O Radha you will
perish soon in grief.."

138
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:40,649
Who's there?

139
00:17:57,843 --> 00:18:01,939
Is this Gangacharan -
Chattopadhyefs house?

140
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:05,208
Yes!

141
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,283
Why?

142
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:18,762
Yesterday his wife Nistarini Devi
of Kailashpur died

143
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:21,390
Who is it?

144
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,209
What do you want?

145
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:44,619
Sir.. my mother
died yesterday

146
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:47,056
Who was your mother?

147
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,860
Nistarini Devi of Kailashpur, Sir..

148
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:55,800
Wait!

149
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:41,369
Kailashpun. here it is-

150
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,916
Phanibhushan Mukhopadhyefs
youngest daughter...

151
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,815
Nistarini Dev


152
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:51,422
Date of wedding -
16th February, 1808...

153
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,858
Are you Patal then?

154
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:22,317
Why, don't sit there!

155
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:26,480
Come, my dear
have a wash first

156
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:32,330
Umi, bring some water

157
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,968
Poor child

158
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:40,903
What a distance to walk!

159
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,337
You look quite exhausted

160
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:49,848
Have you eaten?

161
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:54,442
Can't eat after sunset during
evening! Have some fruits--

162
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:58,215
Tomorrow I will arrange
your ritual meal

163
00:20:58,323 --> 00:20:59,552
Can you cook yourself?

164
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,372
What happened to Mother?

165
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:23,037
Cholera

166
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:21,938
<i>Um“!</i>

167
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,303
I've got your guavas!

168
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:31,408
I've taken your mangoes
I won't give you

169
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:39,981
You witch!
Wait till I tell Grandma!

170
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,019
She'll teach you to eat fruits!
You beast!

171
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:14,544
Goodness!
Just see what she's done!

172
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:17,748
Drawn blood
with her teeth!

173
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:22,358
Poor boy!
His hand is quite blue!

174
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:27,592
Wait till she gets home!
We'll see the end of this!

175
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:29,633
Serves you right for
fighting with your aunt!

176
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:31,964
You be quiet

177
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,038
There's a limit to
patience!

178
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:38,372
It's just my kindness
that I keep forgiving her

179
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,206
Anyone else would have
thrown her out by now

180
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:46,046
Poor child! Does it hurt?
Let me massage it for you-

181
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:57,659
There she is!

182
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:06,137
You little beast!

183
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:08,434
I'll break your
bones today

184
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,304
How dare you bite
your little nephew!

185
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:13,105
His hand is
still blue!

186
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:17,148
If only you knew
what else she's done!

187
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:20,446
What else?
Tell me!

188
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:27,083
She stole Aunty's bangles.
I saw her!

189
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,591
What?

190
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:31,559
Did you hear that?

191
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:34,564
What shall I do with
this thief?

192
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:41,197
She's been trouble
ever since she was born!

193
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:47,572
I'll teach you to steal,
you little thief!

194
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:55,679
Where are those guavas?
Have you hidden them?

195
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:59,187
Here Gopal! Take them

196
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:04,092
Greedy pig!
I'll show you!

197
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:08,826
Get out!
No food for you today!

198
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,067
Mother
Don't interfere

199
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:12,637
Will you go?
Or shall I throw you out?

200
00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:16,736
Good bye.

201
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:49,369
I'm leaving

202
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,760
Our Arithmetic teacher
Haridhanbabu...

203
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:29,926
"suggested a way out

204
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:33,870
A Way out?

205
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:34,666
Yes, Sir

206
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:36,772
He suggested"

207
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:39,742
...a ritual marriage with
a tree for now...

208
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:42,074
...just to get rid of
her unmarried status

209
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:43,746
Shashi's marriage is
stuck just for this

210
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:47,649
After that is over
-No. No!

211
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:52,918
When Laxmi died, she left
her daughter in my care...

212
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:58,929
"She has no one
in the world"

213
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:02,000
Laxmi had said"

214
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,693
"look after her"

215
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,827
Look after her!

216
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:08,065
You mean just talk!

217
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:15,109
Your sister died
leaving a <i>3</i> month's baby

218
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:18,975
It was I who fed
and clothed her...

219
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:19,606
"and cleaned up
her mess!

220
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:21,913
But can I help it
if she's mute?

221
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,786
It's a waste of money
paying her dowry!

222
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:33,057
And every year, the groom
will keep coming for his dues

223
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,928
Do you think any family
will take her home?

224
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:40,096
Any time of day
she's playing by the river!

225
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:47,141
Or roaming about
stealing fruits!

226
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:51,406
Tell me, does a housewife
behave like that?

227
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:55,919
Or do you think Umi
can be tamed into one?

228
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,751
No, this is a
blessing in disguise

229
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,518
This way at least
she will be free.

230
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:02,889
As she has always been

231
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:07,598
That is true

232
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,997
And it's no trouble

233
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:18,101
Doesn't Umi spend hours
by a tree near the river?

234
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,175
That could be the groom

235
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:31,188
What do you say, Father?

236
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:35,051
Shall we consult
Bachaspati?

237
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:35,887
And see what he
has to say?

238
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,699
Madhav Bachaspati?

239
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:50,765
If you wish...

240
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:54,834
I don't approve...

241
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,444
After all...

242
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:03,953
...a human being
wedded to a tree?

243
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:09,115
What do you say, Nabin?

244
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:21,200
Don't start again!
link that half witted child...

245
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:23,236
Can you tell the difference?

246
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:32,207
Anarchy

247
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:37,654
Anarchy is everywhere!

248
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:41,890
In Calcutta that
atheist Ram Mohan...

249
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:46,191
"is ruining our society
with his new fangled ideas!

250
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:50,564
They say the British
will abolish Suttee soon?

251
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:52,932
It's all
Ram “Johan's work!

252
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:57,134
And who will protect the
widows after that?

253
00:32:58,109 --> 00:32:59,042
Ram Mohan,
I suppose?

254
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:06,677
What is the definition
of Suttee?

255
00:33:24,702 --> 00:33:25,066
Meaning

256
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,735
"A wife who grieves in
her husband's sorrow"

257
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,740
"rejoices in his
hour of joy...

258
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:34,073
"is pale and sickly
in his absence

259
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:37,773
And joins him
gladly at death

260
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:39,213
Such a wife
is a Suttee

261
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:41,117
But...

262
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:46,248
...in the hands of foreigners
this holy land...

263
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:49,190
...is being reduced
whore house!

264
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:59,025
A dark future
for Hindus!

265
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,532
I predict a
dark, gloomy future!

266
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:08,071
A moment has arrived
for all Hindus to arise...

267
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,204
...and save our religion
from ruin!

268
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:13,178
Holy Scriptures
say...

269
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:16,083
...that keeping a daughter
unmarried after puberty"

270
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:18,178
...is a grevious sin!

271
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:22,055
You are sinning
gravely Gangacharan!

272
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:42,605
Her horoscope clearly
indicates widowhood..

273
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:47,910
Hmm! .. Mars is
in the eighth...

274
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:52,179
In such a case.

275
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:56,087
Marriage to a tree
is called for

276
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:02,861
Do not hesitate,
Gangacharan

277
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:10,033
This is just a ritual
If widowhood is indicated...

278
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:11,336
...marriage with a tree
will nullify that

279
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:15,072
She may then remarry
if a groom can be found

280
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:18,812
No harm
in that

281
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:24,252
Exactly what Pandit Haridhan
said to our schoolmaster here.

282
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:27,655
Go and inform
Gangacharan...

283
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:31,752
Not to ruin his own
daughter's marriage prospects

284
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:36,323
Marry her to
a tree for the time being

285
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:40,967
If she is lucky
she may get a man later

286
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:43,700
Don't be <i>so</i> upset
Gangacharan

287
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:50,213
Marriage to a tree is an
accepted social custom

288
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:53,380
Trees like Banyan
or Aswatha

289
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:57,150
Are after all symbols
of Lord Narayana!

290
00:35:58,022 --> 00:36:01,287
Therefore society cannot
accuse you of neglecting...

291
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:06,296
...your orphan niece...

292
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:11,225
<i>The kurchi flower
blossoms too soon</i>

293
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:16,398
Our daughter must leave
for her husband's home

294
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:24,278
Our hearts are heavy
with weeping

295
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:30,110
Her father weeps on his
way to the market

296
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:34,249
Her mother weeps on the
way to the shore

297
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:44,892
All he hears is the noise
of our dear ones weeping

298
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:50,372
For they shall
see her no more

299
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:54,240
Her father has
a mansion

300
00:36:54,345 --> 00:37:01,843
The groom has a
hut in the <i>woods</i>

301
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:06,322
What did her father
see in this groom?

302
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:09,223
Alas, what did her
father see?

303
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:15,925
Your destiny is
black, my child

304
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:21,465
Your destiny is bad

305
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:27,210
Your father has sealed your
fate with your groom

306
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:30,508
Your fate has been
sealed with your groom

307
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:29,231
Repeat after me...

308
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:42,277
Now the vermillion paste...

309
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,939
...must be smeared
on the tree

310
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:15,104
It's .. very rough

311
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:22,384
You can smear it now

312
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,658
Bring the
bride...

313
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:16,671
Gurudev?

314
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:26,049
Will you permit me
to ask one question?

315
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:28,481
Askl!

316
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:32,022
You are a
great scholar.

317
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:37,989
...yet you decided
according to custom...

318
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:40,223
Do the scriptures
mention...

319
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:43,323
"marriage between
a tree and a human?

320
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:54,163
That pumpkin there

321
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:54,863
How much?

322
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:57,631
Take it sire!
It is very fresh!

323
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,539
The biggest
of my crop!

324
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:02,340
I'll make it
cheap for you..

325
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:03,242
Only ten cowries

326
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:06,282
What! Ten cowries for
one pumpkin?

327
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:07,646
It is plain
robbery!

328
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:10,721
Sir, if you people
start complaining...

329
00:43:10,821 --> 00:43:11,686
how can we survive?

330
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:12,756
There's the matchmaker!

331
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:31,605
But you left it
too late!

332
00:43:31,709 --> 00:43:33,370
Brides fathers are always
in a hurry

333
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:36,913
I fixed this one up..

334
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:40,549
"With Mukherjee's son
in Harinarayanpur

335
00:43:42,386 --> 00:43:44,286
What shall we do?

336
00:43:44,388 --> 00:43:45,321
You've put me
in a spot!

337
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:48,323
Rich medium-caste
brides are rare...

338
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:50,257
But yes

339
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:52,489
If a high-caste
girl will do...

340
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:54,291
...I can get you one
immediately!

341
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:57,459
Medium-caste families
pay more...

342
00:43:57,568 --> 00:43:59,400
...and this is Kali's
first marriage...

343
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:04,932
Oh? He has not taken
the plunge yet?

344
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:07,371
Keep him aside!

345
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,276
He's a prize catch!

346
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:13,283
I'll find him a
rich bride!

347
00:44:13,784 --> 00:44:13,909
But...

348
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:17,882
What about the boy
for my sister?

349
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:20,722
I've held on to him

350
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:23,350
Just arrange for the
dowry money

351
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:27,496
That's the hitch!

352
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:30,431
Try to find us
a bride...

353
00:44:30,534 --> 00:44:33,367
"who will bring some dowry
at least".

354
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:36,565
Either Kali or his brother
must marry to...

355
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,665
Got it!

356
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:44,345
This is March -
I'll arrange it by May!

357
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:47,383
Well, Haricharan?

358
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:50,249
Want to tie
the knot again?

359
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:09,431
Umi

360
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:14,940
Come here

361
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:29,351
Open that box

362
00:46:02,893 --> 00:46:07,524
You will find a
small box inside

363
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:24,072
Found it?

364
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:42,424
Bring it here
Wait! Sit down

365
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:24,408
These belonged to
your mother

366
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:31,608
I had kept them
for your trousser

367
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,818
But now...

368
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:41,749
Here..keep them.

369
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:54,934
Come on!

370
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:56,563
What is the matter?

371
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:09,189
Certainly
Of course...

372
00:51:15,372 --> 00:51:15,838
Look out!

373
00:51:29,786 --> 00:51:30,082
Father"?

374
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:35,688
Father"?

375
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:39,722
Father"?

376
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,702
It's over.
You can come in

377
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:29,334
<i>A QM again'.!</i>

378
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:08,081
Where are you going my son?

379
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:09,744
To fetch you a slave,
mother

380
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:12,788
You have my blessings

381
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:16,689
May the new bride bring
prosperity and male children

382
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:18,124
We should start now
Yes, my sons

383
00:53:24,401 --> 00:53:25,994
God be with you

384
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:56,764
So they have left.
Haricharan and Kalicharan?

385
00:53:58,268 --> 00:53:58,894
Yes

386
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:34,767
Trying to make trouble
with that knight!

387
00:54:34,871 --> 00:54:39,900
Fancying yourself
a Grand Master, eh?

388
00:54:48,184 --> 00:54:52,951
There! Check!

389
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:03,562
I believe Haricharan is
bringing his bride home?

390
00:55:06,269 --> 00:55:08,966
What's up, schoolmaster?

391
00:55:10,206 --> 00:55:11,970
A high caste Brahmin
and poor too

392
00:55:13,343 --> 00:55:17,940
One is alive, suddenly
another wife?

393
00:55:18,048 --> 00:55:20,073
It's not a permanent
arrangement

394
00:55:20,884 --> 00:55:22,875
This one will go back
after three months

395
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:24,888
They won't bring her again
- Really?

396
00:55:26,089 --> 00:55:28,456
That was the agreement

397
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:29,582
Her father's rich

398
00:55:29,859 --> 00:55:32,021
paid well for her too

399
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:34,388
...but on one condition...

400
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:37,990
...no one should say "She's never
seen her husband's home!

401
00:55:41,137 --> 00:55:42,195
I see

402
00:55:45,575 --> 00:55:48,545
Well?
Will you take all night?

403
00:55:49,446 --> 00:55:50,311
Move

404
00:55:54,617 --> 00:55:56,016
There!
Now try and save your rook!

405
00:58:09,752 --> 00:58:11,413
Mother, a female!

406
00:59:27,788 --> 00:59:29,119
Aunty
Umi...

407
00:59:30,791 --> 00:59:32,816
Oh, she's delivered!

408
00:59:33,828 --> 00:59:35,091
When did it happen?

409
00:59:36,864 --> 00:59:37,729
Au nty!

410
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:47,330
What's all this?

411
00:59:48,409 --> 00:59:49,535
Who's that? Nabin?

412
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:52,640
It was born this morning

413
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:56,878
A female!
God has been kind at last

414
01:00:00,187 --> 01:00:03,088
Why, what have you brought?

415
01:00:05,593 --> 01:00:07,357
So, you had been
to the market?

416
01:00:08,496 --> 01:00:10,225
You do <i>so</i> much for us!

417
01:00:11,132 --> 01:00:11,564
That's alright

418
01:00:11,932 --> 01:00:13,195
You, how can I refuse?

419
01:00:14,135 --> 01:00:15,466
Both the boys are away.
You take their place...

420
01:00:15,569 --> 01:00:16,866
...just like another son!

421
01:00:20,574 --> 01:00:24,101
You were going
to fetch your wife

422
01:00:24,211 --> 01:00:25,110
When are you leaving?

423
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:28,280
I will, once your sons are back

424
01:00:32,653 --> 01:00:35,145
Oh dear!
It looks like a storm!

425
01:00:36,157 --> 01:00:38,216
Any moment now!
I'd better go...

426
01:00:39,226 --> 01:00:40,591
I'll drop in after
<i>school</i> tomorrow

427
01:00:40,695 --> 01:00:43,824
There!
It's started!

428
01:00:47,368 --> 01:00:49,302
Quick! Get the
clothes off the line!

429
01:00:49,704 --> 01:00:51,934
There go my pickles!
Soaked though

430
01:00:52,206 --> 01:00:52,695
Nabin! You're getting wet
Come up here

431
01:00:56,177 --> 01:00:58,578
No. no. I must be off now

432
01:00:59,313 --> 01:01:03,682
Wait! Umi!
Get the umbrella! Quick!

433
01:01:04,418 --> 01:01:05,408
Oh dear me!

434
01:01:47,461 --> 01:01:49,327
Damn! Can't see a thing!

435
01:01:51,565 --> 01:01:53,863
Umi! Get a lamp
from the kitchen

436
01:01:56,237 --> 01:01:57,398
You'll find it
on the shelf

437
01:02:21,896 --> 01:02:23,295
Shut the door!
The flame will go out!

438
01:02:25,332 --> 01:02:26,356
Keep it on that shelf,

439
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:42,482
Why are you standing
there like a statue?

440
01:02:45,586 --> 01:02:48,283
Oh dear! You're soaked through
like a scarecrow!

441
01:02:49,356 --> 01:02:53,452
Wait, dry yourself
Before you go

442
01:02:53,594 --> 01:02:54,618
Here!
Take this

443
01:03:02,403 --> 01:03:04,462
Still staring?
Dry yourself quickly!

444
01:03:37,071 --> 01:03:41,440
Can't manage by yourself?

445
01:03:41,675 --> 01:03:43,006
Shall I do it for you?

446
01:03:48,949 --> 01:03:52,681
Come, I'll do it

447
01:03:58,726 --> 01:04:00,023
Don't be frightened!

448
01:04:29,757 --> 01:04:30,656
Come

449
01:04:56,550 --> 01:04:59,076
Feeling cold?

450
01:05:01,522 --> 01:05:03,957
Come and sit on the bed

451
01:05:22,476 --> 01:05:23,807
Lie down

452
01:05:33,053 --> 01:05:38,651
Don't say a word to anyone!

453
01:05:40,127 --> 01:05:46,999
How can you?
God preferred them silent!

454
01:06:04,718 --> 01:06:06,243
Hey schoolmaster!
Are you home?

455
01:06:21,602 --> 01:06:27,632
Have a about our round of
chess?

456
01:06:31,745 --> 01:06:32,906
It's Mr. Dutta!
Let go of me!

457
01:06:33,647 --> 01:06:36,082
Wait a minute, Mr. Dutta

458
01:06:36,550 --> 01:06:38,040
Let go of me

459
01:06:38,152 --> 01:06:46,152
There's no one about
<i>Go</i> through the back door!

460
01:06:59,573 --> 01:07:00,563
Coming Mr. Dutta!

461
01:07:01,642 --> 01:07:02,234
Hurry up!

462
01:07:08,715 --> 01:07:09,739
Went asleep, Did you?

463
01:07:11,085 --> 01:07:12,314
Just dozed of a bit

464
01:07:13,187 --> 01:07:14,712
Come in

465
01:07:43,717 --> 01:07:46,652
When the rain started,
allow schoolmaster...

466
01:07:46,753 --> 01:07:50,849
...I said to myself
There goes our game!

467
01:07:52,192 --> 01:07:55,287
Then, when it let up
a bit..

468
01:07:55,395 --> 01:08:03,395
...I thought, today
I must beat Nabini

469
01:08:06,406 --> 01:08:09,899
Chess is really
intoxicating, you know

470
01:08:12,779 --> 01:08:16,079
Obviously" since you
braved such foul weather!

471
01:08:16,416 --> 01:08:17,110
Start

472
01:09:48,175 --> 01:09:48,971
Here

473
01:10:59,513 --> 01:11:01,311
Aunty! We've come to
see the new bride

474
01:11:03,850 --> 01:11:05,909
Why have you
fallen behind...

475
01:11:06,019 --> 01:11:07,180
"with the torch?

476
01:11:07,954 --> 01:11:08,853
It's <i>so</i> dark here!

477
01:11:21,535 --> 01:11:24,800
Umi!
Got the firewood?

478
01:11:26,039 --> 01:11:28,406
Ah! You've come!

479
01:11:30,077 --> 01:11:31,101
Why this delay?

480
01:11:31,511 --> 01:11:32,569
What a journey!

481
01:11:32,979 --> 01:11:34,276
When did you arrive?

482
01:11:35,048 --> 01:11:38,848
This afternoon.
I had such a back ache...

483
01:11:38,952 --> 01:11:42,320
...after that tiresome boat trip!
I had to stretch a little

484
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:45,024
Just hold this for me

485
01:11:45,125 --> 01:11:48,151
God bless you, my dear.
May you be outlived...

486
01:11:48,261 --> 01:11:50,889
...by your husband

487
01:11:52,933 --> 01:11:55,095
Why all this, dear?

488
01:11:55,202 --> 01:11:57,227
It's nothing, Aunty

489
01:11:58,171 --> 01:12:00,333
I thought, they don't get
anything decent...

490
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:04,377
...in that awful hole.
Let me take some"

491
01:12:04,478 --> 01:12:09,575
...fancy sweets from Calcutta.
Where's the new bride?

492
01:12:10,617 --> 01:12:14,485
In there, come. -Wasn't that the
elder one's room

493
01:12:14,588 --> 01:12:16,522
...She had to give it to the
newly weds

494
01:12:16,623 --> 01:12:23,996
Sabitri and the children
have moved in with me

495
01:12:24,931 --> 01:12:30,097
What to do? Such shortage of
space and <i>so</i> many people!

496
01:12:31,538 --> 01:12:34,564
Sabitri-
Take this post of sweets-

497
01:12:42,682 --> 01:12:44,446
Ah! Here's our sister!

498
01:12:45,919 --> 01:12:48,854
Goodness!
How awful you look!

499
01:12:48,955 --> 01:12:53,893
Circles under your eyes! So pale
and sickly! Have you been ill?

500
01:12:53,994 --> 01:12:58,454
We'll come and chat later.
Let me just meet the new bride

501
01:12:59,599 --> 01:13:02,330
Hmm.. the bracelets are not
<i>so</i> bad

502
01:13:03,603 --> 01:13:10,339
But taking of bangles, not better
with my friends wedding pair

503
01:13:11,311 --> 01:13:14,042
A double cable! So attractive!

504
01:13:14,147 --> 01:13:15,581
I've borrowed the pattern
from her

505
01:13:15,682 --> 01:13:18,652
Other has promised to have eight
pairs made for me!

506
01:13:19,419 --> 01:13:24,186
Of course, I have these already.
But I am tired of them

507
01:13:27,594 --> 01:13:33,260
Is that the new baby?
"Poor Sabitri!"

508
01:13:33,366 --> 01:13:36,427
I said to my mother
as soon as I heard-

509
01:13:36,536 --> 01:13:40,439
"A daughter again this year!
What a shame!"

510
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:46,673
And they're not <i>so</i> well off
either

511
01:13:46,947 --> 01:13:50,679
Getting each one married is
such a drain on the family!

512
01:13:50,951 --> 01:13:56,014
Are you going to live here from
now on.- Me? Are you crazy?

513
01:13:56,122 --> 01:14:00,491
No servants! No proper house!

514
01:14:00,594 --> 01:14:03,655
I am going back next week!

515
01:14:04,631 --> 01:14:08,727
Besides, my Aunt is coming from
Benaras to visit us in Calcutta

516
01:14:09,636 --> 01:14:11,730
We'll all go by palanquins
to bathe in the Ganges

517
01:14:12,706 --> 01:14:17,200
Have you ever seen the Ganges,
Ashpa,the big Ganges in Calcutta

518
01:14:21,281 --> 01:14:24,945
The East India Company's huge
ships, how grand they look!

519
01:14:25,051 --> 01:14:29,613
With those pipe like things on
top and black smoke coming out!

520
01:14:30,490 --> 01:14:34,358
We watch everyday from our
terrace, you see! What fun it is!

521
01:14:35,362 --> 01:14:37,296
You know where the cemented
strand by the Ganges?

522
01:14:37,397 --> 01:14:39,627
Every evening we see Memsahibs
there in their gowns...

523
01:14:39,733 --> 01:14:44,762
Strolling with their parasols and
logs arm-in-arm with the Sahibs

524
01:14:45,038 --> 01:14:48,975
And here? There's nothing!
I hadn't wanted to come...

525
01:14:49,075 --> 01:14:53,034
...but father said it wouldn't
ok nice and people would talk.

526
01:14:54,281 --> 01:14:55,771
<i>Um“ The firewood'.!</i>

527
01:14:56,716 --> 01:14:59,242
Made him promise before coming.
"I won't stay more than a week"

528
01:14:59,352 --> 01:15:01,320
"You must not insist then!"

529
01:15:02,522 --> 01:15:03,751
Doesn't your husband get angry?

530
01:15:06,259 --> 01:15:08,227
He should be glad I came at all!

531
01:15:09,296 --> 01:15:11,128
Now promise that you won't
tell anyone

532
01:15:11,765 --> 01:15:14,132
Today my back and my feet
ached <i>so</i> much

533
01:15:14,234 --> 01:15:19,400
...after that boat ride. I made
him massage them for me

534
01:15:21,741 --> 01:15:23,072
Feet too!

535
01:15:25,745 --> 01:15:30,444
<i>Um“ Um“ Here she is'.!</i>

536
01:15:30,684 --> 01:15:32,652
Avesdropping here instead of
finishing your work!

537
01:15:33,687 --> 01:15:34,677
Didn't I ask you to
get me some firewood?

538
01:15:34,788 --> 01:15:38,053
So busy listening.
she's lost all sense of time!

539
01:15:41,494 --> 01:15:42,552
It will take hours to light
the stove again!

540
01:15:42,662 --> 01:15:45,529
And I had <i>so</i> hoped to make
be rich pudding for Nabin's wife!

541
01:15:45,632 --> 01:15:47,464
Managed to ruin my plans,
haven't you?

542
01:15:47,834 --> 01:15:53,432
Must you always pry, and nose
sound? Pick up the wood at once

543
01:15:57,410 --> 01:15:59,469
Goodness! Look how
she's defying me!

544
01:16:01,314 --> 01:16:04,079
What! Hitting back!

545
01:16:04,784 --> 01:16:06,081
The cheek of it!

546
01:16:15,195 --> 01:16:18,495
Good gracious!
What will she do next?

547
01:16:35,882 --> 01:16:38,078
Isn't that your deaf-mute
cousin?

548
01:16:39,152 --> 01:16:41,849
Just mute,
She can hear alright!

549
01:18:59,259 --> 01:19:00,727
You've come?

550
01:19:02,762 --> 01:19:03,024
Come in

551
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:30,982
Sister!

552
01:19:41,434 --> 01:19:42,458
Oh, no!

553
01:20:24,010 --> 01:20:27,105
It happens all the time
in the high caste families

554
01:20:27,981 --> 01:20:30,075
Did you find out
who the man is?

555
01:20:32,986 --> 01:20:38,322
No.. She can't speak..so..

556
01:20:38,424 --> 01:20:43,089
It's just as well

557
01:20:52,872 --> 01:20:55,842
Go digging for a worm and
you'll rake up a snake

558
01:20:57,143 --> 01:20:59,339
Might never know who
the culprit may be...eh?

559
01:21:06,486 --> 01:21:07,715
What's the point in
knowing, anyway?

560
01:21:08,755 --> 01:21:12,783
Does any bastard have the guts
to own up?

561
01:21:15,094 --> 01:21:18,394
Hmp! Show me one real man
in this entire village"

562
01:21:18,498 --> 01:21:19,897
...and I'll thank you for it!

563
01:21:30,977 --> 01:21:32,672
Here see this root?

564
01:21:35,715 --> 01:21:39,549
Grind it and mix it
with this medicine paste

565
01:21:39,652 --> 01:21:40,642
Then, in the dead of night,
with your hair loose...

566
01:21:40,753 --> 01:21:42,551
Take Peerbabefs name
and give it to her

567
01:21:42,655 --> 01:21:43,884
At the most

568
01:21:43,990 --> 01:21:48,393
...it will take two days

569
01:21:49,162 --> 01:21:49,628
Here take it

570
01:21:55,635 --> 01:22:02,405
What is the matter?
You're not afraid?

571
01:22:03,476 --> 01:22:10,212
Good Lord, I've handled <i>so</i> many
cases! In such big families too!

572
01:22:11,150 --> 01:22:12,709
This is not the first time!

573
01:22:14,921 --> 01:22:16,616
Not a soul will know!

574
01:22:17,223 --> 01:22:18,019
Come

575
01:22:20,893 --> 01:22:23,419
Do you have a choice now.
my ladies...

576
01:22:23,529 --> 01:22:25,998
"that you stop to consider?

577
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:32,063
Did you think twice when
marrying that woman to a tree?

578
01:22:32,939 --> 01:22:35,840
It it had been a man,
you could have found excuses...

579
01:22:35,942 --> 01:22:43,474
...saying her husband visited her
late at night..or something like

580
01:22:45,018 --> 01:22:47,043
Now it's too late...

581
01:22:47,153 --> 01:22:49,520
...to start worrying!

582
01:22:50,223 --> 01:22:53,193
Hurry up! I have a long
way to go.

583
01:22:59,632 --> 01:23:02,499
Keep her under close watch

584
01:23:03,669 --> 01:23:06,229
Don't let the children go
near her.

585
01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:09,804
And keep her away from
the kitchen

586
01:23:10,710 --> 01:23:14,010
Once the medicine acts,
everything will be soiled

587
01:23:15,648 --> 01:23:16,080
Well, goodbye now

588
01:23:22,121 --> 01:23:24,146
Remember, once it's all over

589
01:23:24,257 --> 01:23:27,784
...you must make me a
silver armlet!

590
01:24:09,702 --> 01:24:12,535
Here, eat this up

591
01:24:18,010 --> 01:24:19,535
Go on!

592
01:25:19,438 --> 01:25:22,203
Take your bedding and
sleep in the cowshed

593
01:25:50,469 --> 01:25:53,632
What are you waiting for?
Go!

594
01:28:44,076 --> 01:28:46,602
Keep it there!

595
01:29:53,179 --> 01:29:56,171
See here!
Want some?

596
01:29:58,184 --> 01:30:00,243
What's the matter?
Are you ill?

597
01:30:00,352 --> 01:30:04,289
Gopal, I warned you
not to go near her

598
01:32:03,309 --> 01:32:05,607
Where on earth is everyone?

599
01:32:06,545 --> 01:32:08,707
Sabitri!

600
01:32:11,083 --> 01:32:12,551
No one has lit the stove!

601
01:32:13,686 --> 01:32:16,178
The cow is bleating herself
hoarse!

602
01:32:17,256 --> 01:32:20,487
I have to see to everything
in my old age!

603
01:32:27,466 --> 01:32:30,094
<i>Um“!</i>

604
01:32:32,838 --> 01:32:36,399
Come! Oh. come on!

605
01:32:45,851 --> 01:32:46,841
Umi...

606
01:33:36,635 --> 01:33:39,661
Hurry! Hurry!
Take everything indoors!

607
01:33:53,786 --> 01:33:56,346
Shut the doors, Pushpa!

608
01:39:13,772 --> 01:39:14,830
Good Lord!

609
01:39:17,876 --> 01:39:21,176
The cowshed has collapsed in
just one night's storm!

610
01:39:37,195 --> 01:39:38,754
The jack-fruit tree
has fallen too...

611
01:39:38,864 --> 01:39:42,732
And we slept through it all!

612
01:39:42,834 --> 01:39:44,632
Who untied the <i>cows?</i>

613
01:39:47,005 --> 01:39:50,532
Umi? Where is Umi?

614
01:39:52,878 --> 01:39:53,868
May be she's gone to
fetch water...

615
01:39:54,846 --> 01:39:56,610
See if her pitcher is
in the kitchen

616
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:18,503
It's here only

617
01:40:23,008 --> 01:40:24,134
Her bed clothes are here too..

618
01:40:24,242 --> 01:40:29,908
Oh! See! When the cowshed
collapsed, she must have"

619
01:40:30,015 --> 01:40:33,713
...slipped into the kitchen <i>&</i> run
off to the river in the morning...

620
01:40:33,819 --> 01:40:36,686
...forgetting her pitcher!

621
01:40:36,788 --> 01:40:38,813
That child will never change!

622
01:40:38,924 --> 01:40:42,053
Let Gopal go and fetch her.
Go, Gopal

623
01:40:55,273 --> 01:40:55,865
What happened?

624
01:40:59,778 --> 01:41:01,576
The witch-doctor's medicine
hasn't worked yet"?

625
01:41:03,148 --> 01:41:04,309
I don't understand it myself.

626
01:41:06,151 --> 01:41:08,779
She had said.
two days at the most.
