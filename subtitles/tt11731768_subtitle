26
00:04:53,477 --> 00:04:55,453
It's been long since he has called.

27
00:04:56,767 --> 00:04:58,062
Granny, how's the water supply?

28
00:04:58,192 --> 00:05:00,132
The supply is really scarce.
Go and get it sooner.

29
00:05:03,016 --> 00:05:05,978
Dear, you were fast asleep.
I didn't want to disturb, so I came earlier.

30
00:05:06,366 --> 00:05:09,124
Leave the cart behind.
I'll get home once they're filled.

31
00:05:09,204 --> 00:05:11,047
I'm yet to do Maayi's laundry.

32
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,322
She'll be heading to college
tomorrow, right.

33
00:05:13,523 --> 00:05:15,109
I'll buy detergent on my way home.

34
00:05:15,218 --> 00:05:17,044
You fill it up
and leave them behind...

35
00:05:17,194 --> 00:05:17,866
I'll bring back the cart.

36
00:05:18,015 --> 00:05:20,148
Why do you have to
take all the responsibility?

37
00:05:20,359 --> 00:05:22,671
Moreover, you've been
spoiling her too much.

38
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,661
She's old enough.

39
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,731
Instead of doing her own laundry,
she's being playful.

40
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:29,317
Mother-in-law, I asked her
not to do the laundry.

41
00:05:29,615 --> 00:05:30,818
Get off her back.

42
00:05:30,982 --> 00:05:35,177
She can't keep up these antics
when she gets married.

43
00:05:35,552 --> 00:05:37,957
Or do you have plans of going there
with your husband and share her chores?

44
00:05:38,209 --> 00:05:40,951
Just wait and watch mother-in-law.
Not just in our house...

45
00:05:41,395 --> 00:05:44,029
but even at her in-law's
she'll be treated like a Queen.

46
00:05:44,381 --> 00:05:45,405
-Selvi, sister!
-Yeah.

47
00:05:45,574 --> 00:05:47,450
Once mother-in-law is done
with filling it up, give me a call.

48
00:05:47,502 --> 00:05:48,705
I'll pick up the cart.

49
00:05:50,388 --> 00:05:53,403
You're very lucky, dear.
Your daughter-in-law is an angel.

50
00:05:53,592 --> 00:05:55,731
But my daughter-in-law is a witch.

51
00:05:56,146 --> 00:05:58,037
There's no water to even wipe our asses.

52
00:05:58,372 --> 00:06:01,294
But she doesn't fail to dive into make-up.

53
00:06:01,585 --> 00:06:02,857
What's it called,
Tak-tak or Tok-Tok?

54
00:06:03,179 --> 00:06:08,137
She's hooked on to it,
dancing her ass off.

55
00:06:08,537 --> 00:06:10,278
Disgusting,
she's a curse to the family.

56
00:06:10,715 --> 00:06:11,862
Shut up, already!

57
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,997
Not enough, there are problems at home,
we have to endure it here too.

58
00:06:15,171 --> 00:06:16,960
We're not here
to listen to your problems.

59
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:19,982
Fill up your pots and leave sooner,
instead of yapping about your problems.

60
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:27,381
Ariyanachi!

61
00:06:28,628 --> 00:06:29,303
Ariyanachi!

62
00:06:31,052 --> 00:06:33,612
Why are you sleeping out here?
Please get inside and sleep.

63
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,856
It was raining. I lost track of time
and dozed off.

64
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,317
Damn, I even forgot
to do the laundry.

65
00:06:37,369 --> 00:06:38,583
In Ramanathapuram...

66
00:06:38,878 --> 00:06:40,237
-it never rains though,
-Come on, dear.

67
00:06:40,947 --> 00:06:43,387
it just drizzles all the time.

68
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:46,739
No one ever out here
has got drenched in the rain.

69
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:48,972
But surely they're drenched in
the sweat of hard-work and loss.

70
00:06:49,053 --> 00:06:50,700
Father-in-law, please have lunch.

71
00:06:50,841 --> 00:06:51,849
I'll have lunch later.

72
00:06:52,301 --> 00:06:55,981
The electricity company
has fired 5 men from our village.

73
00:06:56,722 --> 00:07:00,097
They used them to build the company.

74
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,051
Now that works is done.
They fired them.

75
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,924
Really?

76
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:05,653
All the neighboring villages have come together
and formed a council.

77
00:07:05,737 --> 00:07:07,535
I'll go and attend the meeting
and see what comes of it.

78
00:07:08,135 --> 00:07:10,455
Thank god,
my husband's working abroad.

79
00:07:10,876 --> 00:07:12,506
If only he was here...

80
00:07:13,087 --> 00:07:16,626
I doubt he would've suffered
'cause of the company,

81
00:07:16,704 --> 00:07:18,699
but I'm sure the company
would've been doomed 'cause of him.

82
00:07:19,624 --> 00:07:20,601
-Father-in-law!
-Yeah.

83
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:25,510
In regards to ear-piercing ceremony,
ask my father to speak to the seer.

84
00:07:26,402 --> 00:07:27,199
Sure, I'll inform him.

85
00:07:27,465 --> 00:07:29,471
Your father will be there too.
I'll discuss with him.

86
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:31,416
If my son calls...

87
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:34,715
ask him to inform the folks
about the maternal uncle's rituals.

88
00:07:34,814 --> 00:07:35,923
Sure, I'll make sure to remind him.

89
00:07:36,034 --> 00:07:38,597
I've already spoken to them.
But it'll be great if he does too.

90
00:07:38,656 --> 00:07:40,286
-Okay.
-Sure, I'll ask him to speak to them.

91
00:07:40,542 --> 00:07:41,277
Okay, dear.

92
00:07:45,489 --> 00:07:48,512
Hey, Azhagi. Don't put up your price.
At least say bye.

93
00:07:48,575 --> 00:07:50,357
Sister-in-law is right outside.

94
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:51,576
-Go!
-I don't care.

95
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,060
I said leave. Go!

96
00:07:53,131 --> 00:07:54,521
She's like a sister to me too.
I'll handle her.

97
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:57,154
-Go!
-Stop being a drama queen.

98
00:07:57,316 --> 00:07:58,911
Fine, I'm leaving now.
I'll come again tomorrow.

99
00:08:02,224 --> 00:08:03,881
Wow, did brother send goodies?

100
00:08:04,921 --> 00:08:08,576
Maayi, dear.
All your stuff is in the small bag.

101
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:17,551
Sister-in-law, getting all dolled up...

102
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:20,245
for the video call with my brother is it?

103
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:24,675
Sweetie, shall we see what gifts
has dad sent for us?

104
00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:40,941
Sister-in-law, I can't find
what I had asked for?

105
00:08:41,553 --> 00:08:43,761
-What did you ask for?
-I had asked for a cellphone.

106
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:46,112
Brother had promised to
buy me a cellphone.

107
00:08:46,556 --> 00:08:47,745
Maayi, there's no cellphone.

108
00:08:49,437 --> 00:08:52,340
Keeping our current situation in mind,
cellphone is an unnecessary expense.

109
00:08:53,564 --> 00:08:55,017
Isn't this TV an necessary expense?

110
00:08:55,442 --> 00:08:56,832
Or this saree was a fruitful purchase?

111
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:02,686
Maayi, elders in this house
know what's best for everyone.

112
00:09:02,837 --> 00:09:04,017
Your job is to just get good grades.

113
00:09:05,697 --> 00:09:08,120
I've always scored well
without anyone's help.

114
00:09:11,101 --> 00:09:13,313
I'm well aware of my responsibilities.

115
00:09:17,092 --> 00:09:18,631
She has no other job,
but to lecture me all the time.

116
00:09:18,742 --> 00:09:19,742
Mind your words!

117
00:09:20,195 --> 00:09:21,483
Don't show your arrogance to her.

118
00:09:21,716 --> 00:09:25,022
She's been like a sister to you.
But you're being mean to her.

119
00:09:25,383 --> 00:09:27,643
I don't want anyone to show empathy.

120
00:09:28,397 --> 00:09:30,249
I have the right to ask
for gifts from my brother.

121
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,819
Who is she to come between us?

122
00:09:32,264 --> 00:09:35,361
I'll whack you with the broom.
If you don't mind your words...

123
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,232
I'll rip your mouth apart.

124
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,925
Women in general
always influence their husbands...

125
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:44,401
not to be of support to their families.

126
00:09:45,449 --> 00:09:49,074
But this angel,
is slogging herself for this family.

127
00:09:49,268 --> 00:09:50,115
You're demeaning her.

128
00:09:50,572 --> 00:09:53,037
Let your brother come down.
I'll ask him to straighten you up.

129
00:09:53,245 --> 00:09:56,061
Mother-in-law,
please stop fighting with her.

130
00:09:56,275 --> 00:09:58,253
Does this mean,
I don't matter to this family?

131
00:09:58,408 --> 00:09:59,775
Does she make the rules in this house?

132
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,729
If I don't matter to you people,
it's better that you kill me.

133
00:10:02,838 --> 00:10:04,775
-Or I'll commit suicide.
-Please do!

134
00:10:05,008 --> 00:10:05,791
Die, damn it!

135
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,034
You're of no use.

136
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,229
Mother-in-law, please calm down.

137
00:10:09,549 --> 00:10:11,627
She's being silly and you're not
helping in making it better.

138
00:10:14,564 --> 00:10:18,137
Maayi, come on, let's go shopping
for baby's earrings for the ceremony.

139
00:10:19,595 --> 00:10:20,330
Let's go, dear.

140
00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:23,909
I'm not going anywhere.
Anyways, no one likes me though.

141
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,588
Don't be silly, dear.

142
00:10:27,111 --> 00:10:29,041
You're everyone's favorite in this family.

143
00:10:29,434 --> 00:10:29,942
Come on.

144
00:10:43,849 --> 00:10:47,672
Dear, Maayi Azhagi
is not to be seen anywhere.

145
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:49,232
She must be around. Check again.

146
00:10:49,687 --> 00:10:51,522
-Please check.
-I've checked everywhere. She's missing.

147
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,612
You continue looking for her.
I'll join you soon.

148
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,068
Where are you heading?
Everyone has arrived.

149
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:46,685
Maayi Azhagi,
it's getting late for the ceremony.

150
00:11:46,911 --> 00:11:48,560
She's turning a deaf ear to me.

151
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:50,459
Hey, where are you headed?

152
00:11:50,678 --> 00:11:51,538
I'm going to get my mother.

153
00:11:51,593 --> 00:11:53,787
-Bring Maayi along on your way back.
-Sure, I will.

154
00:12:01,825 --> 00:12:02,410
Look...

155
00:12:02,584 --> 00:12:04,138
-I'm going to shove it in
-His mouth...

156
00:12:04,335 --> 00:12:06,709
Hey, he doesn't have teeth,
but he's here to eat meat.

157
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,943
The ceremony is about to start...

158
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,866
you're the aunt
but you don't seem to care.

159
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:13,949
I came here to be alone. Get lost.

160
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,857
-As if it makes any difference.
-I totally understand.

161
00:12:17,485 --> 00:12:19,601
I came to offer my company,
'cause you're alone.

162
00:12:19,626 --> 00:12:21,013
I'm not in a mood
to entertain your company.

163
00:12:21,101 --> 00:12:21,629
Please leave.

164
00:12:23,905 --> 00:12:26,646
Fine, I'm leaving. Looks like
she only learnt the word "go".

165
00:12:35,782 --> 00:12:39,107
The gifts look fancier
than you expected.

166
00:12:41,307 --> 00:12:42,081
Give it a rest folks!

167
00:12:43,147 --> 00:12:44,753
-My dear, Ariyanachi.
-Yes, father.

168
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:47,771
Auspicious time is running out.
Let's finish the ear-piercing ritual.

169
00:12:49,868 --> 00:12:50,724
Are we at the right place?

170
00:12:50,794 --> 00:12:53,240
-Look, his name is on the banner.
-You're right.

171
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:57,503
Let's ask her.

172
00:12:59,240 --> 00:12:59,739
Girl!

173
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,028
I'm here to meet Ranasingam's family.

174
00:13:02,809 --> 00:13:04,763
I'm his sister.
Tell me what's it regarding?

175
00:13:05,254 --> 00:13:08,137
That's it, dear.
We're almost done piercing.

176
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,510
Don't cry my sweetheart,
please don't cry.

177
00:13:11,878 --> 00:13:13,565
Mother!

178
00:13:14,407 --> 00:13:15,299
Sister-in-law!

179
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,920
Sister-in-law!

180
00:13:24,068 --> 00:13:24,818
Maayi!

181
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,117
-Kasi, what happened to her?
-Maayi!

182
00:13:28,355 --> 00:13:29,433
Didn't I ask you to bring her
with you?

183
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,089
-Go and get her.
-Maayi!

184
00:13:31,363 --> 00:13:32,104
Maayi!

185
00:13:32,246 --> 00:13:33,448
Maayi, what happened?

186
00:13:35,205 --> 00:13:37,060
-What happened, Maayi?
-What happened, dear?

187
00:13:38,136 --> 00:13:39,863
What happened?
Come on, please tell us.

188
00:13:39,935 --> 00:13:41,580
Come on, please tell us what happened?

189
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,378
-Maayi, what happened?
-What happened, dear?

190
00:13:43,888 --> 00:13:44,787
Did someone say anything to you?

191
00:13:44,841 --> 00:13:45,818
What happened, Maayi?

192
00:13:46,505 --> 00:13:48,748
Ariyanachi, I think she's possessed.

193
00:13:49,873 --> 00:13:51,349
Why are you
throwing away deity’s offering?

194
00:13:51,426 --> 00:13:52,513
Come on, tell me.

195
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:54,225
It's about brother...

196
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,504
What about your brother?

197
00:13:56,888 --> 00:13:57,755
Come on, speak up, damn it.

198
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:02,182
Brother...

199
00:14:03,054 --> 00:14:05,441
Brother is no more, mother.

200
00:14:06,518 --> 00:14:07,853
-Are you serious?
-What are you saying?

201
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:09,459
Are you serious?

202
00:14:10,886 --> 00:14:14,026
Our family's lucky charm is no more.

203
00:14:15,246 --> 00:14:16,160
-Oh, no!
-What is she even saying?

204
00:14:16,402 --> 00:14:17,979
I don't understand what she's saying.
Please explain.

205
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:19,730
Sir, please inform them.

206
00:14:20,066 --> 00:14:21,566
Folks, please brace yourself.

207
00:14:22,145 --> 00:14:23,698
And listen to what I have to say.

208
00:14:24,298 --> 00:14:26,142
It's about Ranasingam's job in Dubai...

209
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:28,938
he protested against
the Government of Dubai.

210
00:14:29,392 --> 00:14:31,783
There was a clash between
the Police and the protestors.

211
00:14:32,174 --> 00:14:37,478
Including Ranasingam,
14 others were killed in that riot.

212
00:14:38,454 --> 00:14:39,834
Oh, my god!

213
00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:41,981
My dear, Ranasingam!

214
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:44,057
Their Government will be
sending a fax to us.

215
00:14:44,727 --> 00:14:46,399
Constable, please give them the letter.

216
00:14:48,016 --> 00:14:50,860
Councilor, this is the FIR copy
sent by them.

217
00:14:51,471 --> 00:14:54,392
The other details of the case
will be sent to our Police station shortly.

218
00:14:54,713 --> 00:14:56,432
Once we receive it,
I'll bring them to you myself.

219
00:14:56,713 --> 00:15:00,509
Contact Ranasingam's travel agent
and prepare to claim his dead body.

220
00:15:11,727 --> 00:15:13,032
Has everything come to an end?

221
00:15:14,174 --> 00:15:15,025
I'm not sure about it.

222
00:15:16,478 --> 00:15:18,876
Neither the folks around me
are aware of it.

223
00:15:19,564 --> 00:15:22,314
I wish whatever I heard
shouldn't be true.

224
00:15:23,282 --> 00:15:27,376
Ranasingam,
never takes false pride in things.

225
00:15:27,767 --> 00:15:29,618
Neither being less fortunate
has stopped him.

226
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,094
Only when we sacrifice what we
love the most...

227
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:35,415
people tend to like us.

228
00:15:36,283 --> 00:15:39,267
But my husband Ranasingam was loved
by the people.

229
00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:47,892
A Politician always takes the credit
after the issue is resolved.

230
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,516
My buddy will get it resolved.

231
00:15:49,619 --> 00:15:51,298
And I'll take credit. Just shut up!

232
00:15:52,507 --> 00:15:53,673
I got here first.

233
00:16:07,853 --> 00:16:08,595
Everyone remain calm.

234
00:16:09,224 --> 00:16:11,031
-Everyone, please stay calm.
-Hold on folks!

235
00:16:11,336 --> 00:16:13,219
Please stay calm.
I said, stay calm!

236
00:16:13,603 --> 00:16:14,532
He's not a leader!

237
00:16:14,804 --> 00:16:17,468
But people always pay heed to his word.

238
00:16:17,961 --> 00:16:20,469
That's how I met my husband Ranasingam
for the first time.

239
00:16:21,134 --> 00:16:23,056
There's no water in the
entire district of Ramanathapuram.

240
00:16:23,611 --> 00:16:27,189
The water pipe laid by the government
runs through your village.

241
00:16:27,424 --> 00:16:29,169
If you break the pipe midway...

242
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,165
how do our people or 8 villages beyond it
will get water?

243
00:16:31,377 --> 00:16:33,924
If we don't come to terms
with sharing the water...

244
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:35,706
then how do we
expect the same from other?

245
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:39,014
As you know a lot, why don't you
contest in elections and become MLA...

246
00:16:39,092 --> 00:16:41,706
then build individual pipelines
for each village.

247
00:16:41,854 --> 00:16:43,471
-Which grade did you pass out?
-I passed out 5th grade.

248
00:16:43,619 --> 00:16:44,673
No wonder politics piques
your interest.

249
00:16:44,814 --> 00:16:49,768
It's not possible for us to reign in power
in order to take care of our problems.

250
00:16:49,979 --> 00:16:51,174
Instead we'll question the people
in power.

251
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,096
Your regard sounds good though.

252
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,869
There's no one here
to stand up against the government.

253
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:58,565
The ones present are indulged
in violence and useless activities.

254
00:16:58,682 --> 00:17:03,564
The rest of the bunch is glued
to cellphone with social media and tik-tok.

255
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,978
Folks who couldn't find a job
have gone to abroad.

256
00:17:07,049 --> 00:17:08,299
Stop finding faults in others.

257
00:17:08,433 --> 00:17:10,253
Why don't we get together
and question the government?

258
00:17:10,393 --> 00:17:12,479
If we hesitate to question our rights...

259
00:17:12,713 --> 00:17:14,900
then when the time comes for the real deal,

260
00:17:15,002 --> 00:17:16,791
most of us would be dead
longing for water supply.

261
00:17:16,863 --> 00:17:19,735
If that has to happen,
all the villages has to come together.

262
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,462
People who don't turn up for the protest
shouldn't be given water.

263
00:17:21,513 --> 00:17:23,618
-Sounds great. Shall we do it?
-We shall!

264
00:17:23,782 --> 00:17:26,837
Now let's drop the fight
and share the water supply.

265
00:17:27,057 --> 00:17:28,525
First let her take her share.
She has to go to the school.

266
00:17:28,556 --> 00:17:30,134
-Okay, Ranasingam.
-Maayi, let's go.

267
00:17:30,665 --> 00:17:33,077
My husband, in order to gain
people's trust...

268
00:17:33,174 --> 00:17:34,767
can talk for hours,

269
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,467
also can step down in silence.

270
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,499
He was a sweetheart of the people.

271
00:17:38,976 --> 00:17:41,157
And similarly, he became my sweetheart too.

272
00:17:44,826 --> 00:17:45,649
They're here.

273
00:17:45,704 --> 00:17:46,149
Buddy, over there.

274
00:17:46,214 --> 00:17:49,084
Dad, are they really accurate about
finding these streams?

275
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:50,100
Yes, dear.

276
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,342
Back in the day,
we didn't have Engineers or machines.

277
00:17:52,748 --> 00:17:54,669
Even the scholars were not accurate.

278
00:17:54,811 --> 00:17:57,642
But he has always been very accurate
about finding the source of water.

279
00:17:57,667 --> 00:17:58,198
Oh!

280
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:00,101
Welcome, Mr.Dubai return.

281
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:01,973
-Vanakkam!
-For this, he came down from Dubai?

282
00:18:02,121 --> 00:18:04,238
No, it's his uncle who's from Dubai.

283
00:18:04,428 --> 00:18:04,852
Welcome, son.

284
00:18:04,903 --> 00:18:07,298
Oh, so he's a dummy Dubai return.

285
00:18:08,861 --> 00:18:10,048
You're right,
I'm a dummy Dubai return.

286
00:18:10,104 --> 00:18:12,079
But the shades are originally
from Dubai.

287
00:18:12,518 --> 00:18:15,048
Did you see that?
It's to protect us from the dessert heat.

288
00:18:16,892 --> 00:18:18,711
Sorry for the delay. I was not able
to find the copper wire.

289
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:19,565
Don't worry about it.

290
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,220
As there are no rains...

291
00:18:21,712 --> 00:18:25,415
folks from the surrounding villages
have moved out looking for job.

292
00:18:25,556 --> 00:18:30,423
But I've decided to stay right here
as far as I am alive.

293
00:18:32,072 --> 00:18:34,165
Sir, tears remain the same
for everyone.

294
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:37,062
We have to decide,
if it's for happiness or sorrow.

295
00:18:38,174 --> 00:18:40,174
Just like your generous heart
this land will become fertile.

296
00:18:40,408 --> 00:18:41,243
Glad to hear that.

297
00:18:58,066 --> 00:19:01,691
Dear Lord,
hope we find the source sooner.

298
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,155
Guide us well.

299
00:19:09,455 --> 00:19:10,197
Dear lord!

300
00:19:12,163 --> 00:19:13,524
-Shall we begin?
-Sure, go ahead.

301
00:19:14,011 --> 00:19:14,823
-Let's go.
-Sure.

302
00:19:15,713 --> 00:19:16,970
Water please coming.

303
00:19:18,103 --> 00:19:18,642
Please!

304
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:20,908
Where are you?

305
00:19:23,593 --> 00:19:24,924
Buddy is the water coming?

306
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,162
-Is it this way?
-Yes, go ahead.

307
00:19:27,282 --> 00:19:27,814
Let's go.

308
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,814
Dear Lord, please bless us with water.

309
00:19:33,704 --> 00:19:36,165
That's the wind direction,
it's just going to be air.

310
00:19:37,456 --> 00:19:39,370
-Phew!
-Fine, we'll head this way.

311
00:19:39,642 --> 00:19:40,678
Sure, let's go.

312
00:19:48,756 --> 00:19:50,514
-Give me the chain.
-Sure, hold on.

313
00:19:50,702 --> 00:19:52,646
-The one on your neck.
-Sorry buddy.

314
00:19:52,851 --> 00:19:54,577
-Here you go.
-Remove the stupid shades.

315
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:56,303
-I'm used to it.
-Since when?

316
00:19:56,373 --> 00:19:57,740
Ten minutes, since you gave them to me.

317
00:20:00,586 --> 00:20:02,593
Without shades
eyes are going to burn out.

318
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,358
The heat is unbearable.

319
00:20:04,584 --> 00:20:05,953
It doesn't look like a agricultural land.

320
00:20:06,029 --> 00:20:07,475
-More of a desert--
-This side is not lucky.

321
00:20:08,287 --> 00:20:10,361
Our luck is strong,
we're going to find a river.

322
00:20:10,424 --> 00:20:11,495
Have faith!

323
00:20:14,551 --> 00:20:15,317
We're going to find it.

324
00:20:18,624 --> 00:20:19,436
What's it buddy?

325
00:20:20,046 --> 00:20:20,562
Let's go.

326
00:20:20,927 --> 00:20:23,286
Are you looking for the water source
or inching the land?

327
00:20:23,905 --> 00:20:26,022
Come on, tell me.
Where are you taking me?

328
00:20:27,616 --> 00:20:29,604
Why are you moving zig-zag
like a snake?

329
00:20:31,567 --> 00:20:32,722
Check if that girl is looking
over here?

330
00:20:35,966 --> 00:20:37,580
You're right
she's looking over here.

331
00:20:37,757 --> 00:20:39,026
That's why we couldn't find the source.

332
00:20:39,195 --> 00:20:40,819
Listen girl, please turn around.

333
00:20:42,312 --> 00:20:42,921
What is it?

334
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:46,076
Do we have to stick to this place
or we can check elsewhere too?

335
00:20:46,373 --> 00:20:48,063
You're only to look at our place.

336
00:20:48,233 --> 00:20:50,279
That's why we have hired you people.

337
00:20:50,781 --> 00:20:53,069
She's speaking as if
she offered us a government job.

338
00:20:53,812 --> 00:20:54,850
Tell her we'll find the water.

339
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:56,400
We're going to find the water.

340
00:20:56,545 --> 00:20:58,569
Brother, we've been waiting.

341
00:21:01,895 --> 00:21:03,536
Buddy, don't get distracted.

342
00:21:08,546 --> 00:21:09,210
Buddy!

343
00:21:13,024 --> 00:21:14,595
-Buddy.
-Why is he dancing?

344
00:21:14,661 --> 00:21:15,857
He must've found the water source.

345
00:21:16,061 --> 00:21:17,158
-Oh!
-This place!

346
00:21:18,692 --> 00:21:20,173
Thank goodness,
lord has blessed us with water.

347
00:21:20,537 --> 00:21:21,858
-Pray to the god.
-Thank you lord!

348
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,273
Why is he drawing a huge circle?

349
00:21:28,592 --> 00:21:29,877
-Sir!
-Tell me.

350
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:31,935
If we dig for 150ft. we'll find water.

351
00:21:32,608 --> 00:21:34,751
The water bed is good
and suitable for farming.

352
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:36,506
I'm very happy
and I appreciate the work.

353
00:21:36,841 --> 00:21:38,867
If only we don't the water source...

354
00:21:39,255 --> 00:21:41,904
then you'll have to deliver water
to our farms.

355
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:42,459
Understood?

356
00:21:42,631 --> 00:21:45,928
He's an expert in finding the water source
in this entire district.

357
00:21:46,123 --> 00:21:48,773
If you don't trust us,
then let a cow enter the field.

358
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:51,498
It'll graze around
and finally land into this circle.

359
00:21:51,623 --> 00:21:53,958
It's 'cause the water flow
is right beneath it.

360
00:21:54,281 --> 00:21:54,749
Oh!

361
00:21:55,311 --> 00:21:57,005
So, even the cows
are aware of the source?

362
00:21:57,139 --> 00:21:57,709
Sarcasm!

363
00:21:57,803 --> 00:22:00,920
Then why do we require a
Dubai return for this job?

364
00:22:01,092 --> 00:22:02,115
-It's nothing but--
-Listen...

365
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:03,965
it's not a hobby to play around.

366
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:05,409
I didn't lie,
you'll definitely find the water source.

367
00:22:05,785 --> 00:22:08,222
If you find the source, then you'll
have to bring water to our house.

368
00:22:08,653 --> 00:22:09,754
That's awesome buddy.

369
00:22:09,848 --> 00:22:12,449
-If you do it daily--
-What is Ariyanachi saying?

370
00:22:12,505 --> 00:22:13,614
Oh, Ariyanachi is it?

371
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,880
-It's about the water--
-What?

372
00:22:14,927 --> 00:22:17,426
Nothing much dad,
I told him this is a very good job...

373
00:22:17,614 --> 00:22:19,772
then why is he working abroad in Dubai

374
00:22:20,013 --> 00:22:21,037
rather stay back
and continue doing this.

375
00:22:21,395 --> 00:22:25,084
-This is how you respect a guest?
-She didn't mean to disrespect.

376
00:22:25,936 --> 00:22:29,864
There's enough opportunity out here.
There's no need to move to abroad.

377
00:22:30,068 --> 00:22:31,975
She definitely made a point.
Am I right, Ariyanachi?

378
00:22:33,008 --> 00:22:34,649
You speak wisely, my son.

379
00:22:35,048 --> 00:22:36,989
I've seen him speak well
at the gatherings.

380
00:22:37,372 --> 00:22:38,684
We need people like you.

381
00:22:39,117 --> 00:22:41,882
Once I'm done constructing the well,
we'll meet in person.

382
00:22:42,123 --> 00:22:44,351
Oh, no! Don't take me wrong.

383
00:22:44,734 --> 00:22:47,523
Dad made the deal.
It's better you pay him.

384
00:22:47,716 --> 00:22:49,936
I'll surely meet him person.
But you take this money.

385
00:22:50,233 --> 00:22:52,397
Dad must've done it as a favor too.

386
00:22:52,554 --> 00:22:54,327
It's better you discuss with him
and sort it.

387
00:22:55,054 --> 00:22:56,287
I'll take a leave. Thank you.

388
00:22:56,379 --> 00:22:57,920
-Okay, son.
-Ariyanachi, bye.

389
00:23:01,108 --> 00:23:03,749
Buddy, at least should've taken 100 bucks.
We could've had tea.

390
00:23:04,602 --> 00:23:05,599
What if your dad asks for
the money?

391
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:07,205
This job is free for Ariyanachi!

392
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,154
Let's wait and watch,
if we can find the water source.

393
00:23:13,936 --> 00:23:16,162
Ranasingam,
why don't you explain to us?

394
00:23:16,546 --> 00:23:17,475
Greetings to one and all.

395
00:23:18,426 --> 00:23:21,357
I just returned after discussing
with the folks of Punavaasal.

396
00:23:21,451 --> 00:23:23,577
If that's done,
there's nothing new to discuss.

397
00:23:23,725 --> 00:23:26,935
Just 'cause their village
falls first on the pipeline...

398
00:23:27,334 --> 00:23:29,295
they're very rude to
the other villages.

399
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:32,799
If we stop the transport to their village,
they'll be on track.

400
00:23:33,085 --> 00:23:36,543
I'm not supporting either of the party.
I'm a neutral negotiator.

401
00:23:36,933 --> 00:23:40,659
Let me put it in simple terms.
Instead of saving scarce rain water...

402
00:23:40,901 --> 00:23:42,842
along with the overflowing water
from Cauvery,

403
00:23:43,035 --> 00:23:46,470
according to the land degradation
and river restoration scheme

404
00:23:46,713 --> 00:23:50,553
we'll appeal to set scheme in motion.

405
00:23:50,728 --> 00:23:53,688
Also, we've protested
many times in regard to this.

406
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:59,088
Moreover, our lands are
sucked dry and turned into desert...

407
00:23:59,282 --> 00:24:02,001
we have to destroy
the mesquites plants infecting our lands.

408
00:24:02,142 --> 00:24:05,585
As it's a common problem.
We'll have to stand united and protest.

409
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:06,861
That's the purpose of this meeting.

410
00:24:07,031 --> 00:24:08,108
-Understood?
-Are you serious?

411
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:10,359
Our only hope for survival are
those mesquites plants.

412
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:12,295
If not for it, we won't be able to
afford our daily meals.

413
00:24:12,601 --> 00:24:15,990
If we destroy them, then everyone
has to beg at the bus stand for food.

414
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:18,672
Fifty years ago
there were no mesquites plants.

415
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:20,171
It's an international breed
and it's poisonous.

416
00:24:20,408 --> 00:24:22,774
It doesn't matter
if it's poisonous or not...

417
00:24:22,932 --> 00:24:24,937
we care less about it, Ranasingam.

418
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:26,610
That's our staple now.

419
00:24:26,869 --> 00:24:30,298
Find a better way to tackle this issue
than destroying those plants.

420
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:33,517
You're just concerned
about the current survival.

421
00:24:33,814 --> 00:24:38,049
But the soil should remain fertile
for our future generations too.

422
00:24:38,383 --> 00:24:41,023
Even if there's water supply,
no one's ready to take up agriculture.

423
00:24:41,329 --> 00:24:43,546
Even graduates like me are
struggling to find a job.

424
00:24:43,728 --> 00:24:45,656
The electricity company is
offering us jobs.

425
00:24:45,781 --> 00:24:46,919
Why should we protest?

426
00:24:47,135 --> 00:24:54,343
There are more than 2.5 lac graduates
unemployed in this district.

427
00:24:54,829 --> 00:24:56,251
-Do you folks agree?
-Agreed!

428
00:24:56,493 --> 00:24:59,673
How many jobs do you think
the electricity company can offer?

429
00:25:00,306 --> 00:25:02,444
May be 3000 or maximum 5000 jobs.

430
00:25:02,642 --> 00:25:04,709
Or let's just take it,
10,000 jobs. What next?

431
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:08,812
Later, when our people demand a hike,
they'll fire us.

432
00:25:09,076 --> 00:25:10,974
They'll employ their own people,
leave us in despair.

433
00:25:11,163 --> 00:25:12,295
He's absolutely right.

434
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:15,732
It's our people who are suffering
for an ounce of water.

435
00:25:16,053 --> 00:25:18,560
Do you think my generation
hasn't seen fertile lands?

436
00:25:19,302 --> 00:25:22,689
We were a little lethargic
and let the ground level water run dry.

437
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:24,562
-Ranasingam.
-Yes, sir.

438
00:25:25,162 --> 00:25:27,271
As you've come in person to invite us...

439
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:30,834
Mezhathoval folks will join you
in the protest.

440
00:25:31,075 --> 00:25:33,451
-Do you folks agree?
-Yes, we'll join the protest.

441
00:25:33,819 --> 00:25:34,398
Definitely!

442
00:26:04,726 --> 00:26:06,561
Hey-- Hey, dummy Dubai!

443
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:07,483
Hey!

444
00:26:10,432 --> 00:26:12,205
Mr.Stream, please stop.

445
00:26:12,345 --> 00:26:13,600
I said, stop. Damn it!

446
00:26:17,378 --> 00:26:19,189
Hey, you saw a lady standing alone...

447
00:26:19,253 --> 00:26:22,010
but you don't have the
courtesy to check what's wrong?

448
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:24,031
-Tell me
-You were standing alone.

449
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,634
I thought you were waiting for someone,
so I kept minding my business.

450
00:26:27,345 --> 00:26:29,118
How would I know
you were dying to meet me?

451
00:26:29,775 --> 00:26:30,532
Don't flatter yourself.

452
00:26:30,804 --> 00:26:33,039
As if you're
an irresistible Casanova.

453
00:26:33,336 --> 00:26:35,822
And all the Queens in the world
are in line to meet you.

454
00:26:36,812 --> 00:26:39,898
Weren't you restless and impatient
to meet this Casanova?

455
00:26:40,623 --> 00:26:42,790
Who told you that
I was restless and impatient?

456
00:26:43,663 --> 00:26:46,491
You conned my dad
with the water source and took his money.

457
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:48,073
I'm here take back that money.

458
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:48,852
Give me my money back.

459
00:26:48,953 --> 00:26:50,835
Did you just say I conned your father?

460
00:26:51,212 --> 00:26:55,252
Yes. I'm not a fool like my father
to believe in your antics.

461
00:26:55,451 --> 00:26:59,103
Look mister, it'll be better
if you actually prove your theory.

462
00:26:59,375 --> 00:27:01,804
If you fail to do so,
then return the money.

463
00:27:03,298 --> 00:27:03,994
Fair enough!

464
00:27:04,977 --> 00:27:08,135
To check the existence of stream,
I'll need some equipments.

465
00:27:08,477 --> 00:27:11,144
I'll first get them
and then inform your father about it.

466
00:27:11,446 --> 00:27:13,211
After which you continue to wait for me
standing alone out here.

467
00:27:13,461 --> 00:27:17,750
I knew you'll give me lame excuses.

468
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:20,780
Aren't these the pieces of equipment
you need to check the stream?

469
00:27:20,976 --> 00:27:21,374
Hold them.

470
00:27:22,024 --> 00:27:22,453
Here you go.

471
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,454
Here is the pot...

472
00:27:25,047 --> 00:27:25,799
coconut,

473
00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:28,258
and then your main equipment.

474
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:29,414
Finally, water.

475
00:27:29,828 --> 00:27:32,234
Now go and find that water stream for me.

476
00:27:35,867 --> 00:27:36,758
There's no water in this area.

477
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:38,164
It's possible only if it rains.

478
00:27:38,851 --> 00:27:41,406
Fraud-- You're a fraud.
Give me back my money.

479
00:27:41,448 --> 00:27:42,315
I never took the money.

480
00:27:42,353 --> 00:27:44,736
You dad must've taken money
from my father. Return that money.

481
00:27:49,289 --> 00:27:49,727
What is it?

482
00:27:50,116 --> 00:27:51,960
-You want to see the water, right?
-Yes!

483
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,190
I'll show it to you.
Hold this bottle.

484
00:27:59,728 --> 00:28:01,963
My lord, please let this fool be
my future wife.

485
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,486
Hey, hey, hey... hold on.
What are you holding? Show me that.

486
00:28:08,735 --> 00:28:09,641
Come on, show it to me.

487
00:28:09,884 --> 00:28:11,329
Not this, open your fist.

488
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:12,579
I said, open it.

489
00:28:12,642 --> 00:28:13,563
Come on, open your fist.

490
00:28:15,858 --> 00:28:16,538
Thought as much.

491
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:22,446
Hey, be careful with coconut.

492
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,337
Hold your horses.
Let me tie my veshti.

493
00:28:34,282 --> 00:28:37,033
Hey, how come the coconut
didn't stop but you did?

494
00:28:39,156 --> 00:28:40,031
What the hell are you doing?

495
00:28:40,283 --> 00:28:41,220
Didn't you see coconut going up?

496
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:42,337
That infers that water is up in the sky.

497
00:28:42,634 --> 00:28:44,907
Fraudster, you're caught red-handed now.

498
00:28:45,088 --> 00:28:47,470
My father was naive to believe
a fraud like you...

499
00:28:47,533 --> 00:28:51,655
and sold all my jewels saved up
for my wedding and now digging a well.

500
00:28:51,795 --> 00:28:53,107
I'm going to take care of him later.

501
00:28:53,321 --> 00:28:54,008
I'm going to--

502
00:28:55,273 --> 00:28:55,680
Hold on!

503
00:28:56,539 --> 00:28:56,923
Give me that.

504
00:28:57,007 --> 00:28:58,125
-Fraud!
-Listen, girl...

505
00:28:58,375 --> 00:29:00,617
if your father finds the water stream
inside the well he's digging at the moment.

506
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:03,844
I'll return the jewels
and a wedding chain. Will you marry me?

507
00:29:04,141 --> 00:29:05,282
Why not? I'll marry you.

508
00:29:05,392 --> 00:29:08,146
I'll complaint to the Police
and get you handcuffed.

509
00:29:08,386 --> 00:29:09,394
He's getting too cheeky.

510
00:29:09,774 --> 00:29:10,617
Conman!

511
00:29:16,445 --> 00:29:17,624
My dear, Ariyanachi.

512
00:29:17,836 --> 00:29:18,854
It's going to rain now.

513
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:20,572
You can file a complaint
once the rain stops.

514
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,687
Now come and stand beside me.

515
00:29:21,835 --> 00:29:22,624
Did you say, rain?

516
00:29:22,749 --> 00:29:24,407
Hey, you never change, do you?

517
00:29:24,716 --> 00:29:27,442
It's scorching hot
and you're expecting it to rain.

518
00:29:27,843 --> 00:29:31,218
If I come stand beside, are you going to
push the rain with your hands?

519
00:29:31,619 --> 00:29:32,443
Get lost!

520
00:29:32,526 --> 00:29:34,607
How do you expect me to push the rain,
if it won't fall on me?

521
00:29:34,947 --> 00:29:35,736
You're kidding me, right?

522
00:29:36,165 --> 00:29:38,783
You're saying that
on your side it won't rain...

523
00:29:38,971 --> 00:29:41,751
but it will rain 10ft. opposite
to your side.

524
00:29:42,088 --> 00:29:44,900
Hey, if even it drizzles a drop...

525
00:29:45,066 --> 00:29:46,401
I'll get married to you.

526
00:29:46,706 --> 00:29:48,380
If at all it doesn't rain...

527
00:29:48,642 --> 00:29:50,142
then you should stop
finding streams for people.

528
00:29:50,408 --> 00:29:50,860
Agreed?

529
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:53,874
-I swear I won't find streams if I lose.
-Let's see.

530
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:12,651
You're caught red-handed!

He's not able to bend or move.

546
00:31:20,213 --> 00:31:21,385
He's suffering a lot.

547
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,169
Mr.Ranasingam,
I thought you were getting a wedding chain.

548
00:31:25,253 --> 00:31:27,010
You look curled up like a prawn.

549
00:31:27,121 --> 00:31:28,780
Are you planning
to tie the wedding chain on my leg?

550
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:31,912
My dear, I'm in dire pain.

551
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,702
For god sake,
please relieve me off this pain.

552
00:31:36,143 --> 00:31:39,286
Sure, I'm going to relieve you.
I am definitely here for that.

553
00:31:39,534 --> 00:31:40,619
But I have one condition.

554
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:44,833
Hey... where are you looking at?

555
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:45,797
I'm looking at your hand.

556
00:31:48,034 --> 00:31:49,073
Thought as much.

557
00:31:50,727 --> 00:31:53,174
Hey, can you see my face now?

558
00:31:55,353 --> 00:31:56,486
Look at my face and talk.

559
00:31:57,486 --> 00:32:01,275
How are you able to find the water stream
ruining under the earth?

560
00:32:01,869 --> 00:32:04,259
And how did you know
it was going to rain the other day?

561
00:32:04,565 --> 00:32:06,541
If you tell me the truth
without spinning stories...

562
00:32:06,784 --> 00:32:07,935
I'll relieve you off your pain.

563
00:32:10,282 --> 00:32:11,399
In order to find the water stream...

564
00:32:12,736 --> 00:32:14,532
a current wave from my body
is passed on to the earth.

565
00:32:15,565 --> 00:32:17,643
Similarly a current wave
from earth will enter my body.

566
00:32:18,987 --> 00:32:23,452
It's hereditary and was passed on to me.

567
00:32:24,168 --> 00:32:24,928
That's about it.

568
00:32:25,767 --> 00:32:29,024
Oh, so you mean to say
there's current inside your body?

569
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:29,906
Oh, no!

570
00:32:31,212 --> 00:32:33,204
Will I get a shock if I touch you?

571
00:32:33,295 --> 00:32:35,209
Will I get a shock
If I touch here or here?

572
00:32:35,288 --> 00:32:36,811
Mister, I didn't get a shock though?

573
00:32:37,138 --> 00:32:39,004
Why are you screaming
when there's no current inside your body?

574
00:32:39,085 --> 00:32:39,951
Why are you screaming?

575
00:33:08,583 --> 00:33:13,209
♪ As far as I can see,
there’s not a single patch of green ♪

576
00:33:13,597 --> 00:33:18,268
♪ Meadows are dry on this barren land,

581
00:33:37,652 --> 00:33:39,670
Oh, Lord, help me fix him.

582
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:50,396
That's it. It's fixed.

583
00:33:55,021 --> 00:34:00,311
Hey, hereafter instead of being
arrogant be a modest person.

584
00:34:00,592 --> 00:34:04,553
Hey! What did madam just say?

585
00:34:05,991 --> 00:34:08,647
I'm not sure if you were
waiting for me the other day.

586
00:34:09,411 --> 00:34:13,770
But today you came
all the way on your bike...

587
00:34:14,317 --> 00:34:15,165
just to see me, right?

588
00:34:15,295 --> 00:34:17,459
It's like men like you never change?

589
00:34:17,564 --> 00:34:19,042
I was not raised well.
There was no one to discipline me.

590
00:34:19,117 --> 00:34:20,799
Why don't we get married
and you can discipline me?

591
00:34:20,861 --> 00:34:21,760
Please discipline me.

592
00:34:21,829 --> 00:34:23,753
I shouldn't have
listened to those old hags.

593
00:34:23,877 --> 00:34:24,743
I regret it now.

594
00:34:26,438 --> 00:34:27,758
I thought you loved me?

595
00:34:28,547 --> 00:34:30,117
The measurement for the
wedding chain is done.

596
00:34:30,329 --> 00:34:32,898
Today I got the measurement for
the toe ring too.

597
00:34:33,388 --> 00:34:34,813
All left is to book a wedding hall.

598
00:34:34,845 --> 00:34:35,904
Shall we get it done,
Ariyanachi?

599
00:34:35,954 --> 00:34:38,009
Hey, let us know the wedding date.

600
00:34:38,463 --> 00:34:39,582
Hey, Ariyanachi.

601
00:34:40,132 --> 00:34:44,203
♪ no matter how much you boil aloe,
from within, water won’t leave ♪

602
00:34:45,587 --> 00:34:47,452
-Vanakkam, brother.
-Welcome, son. Please come.

603
00:34:48,337 --> 00:34:51,230
Seer, it was him who found
the water stream under our land.

604
00:34:51,475 --> 00:34:52,701
His name is, Ranasingam.

605
00:34:53,296 --> 00:34:53,710
Vanakkam!

606
00:34:54,587 --> 00:34:55,759
I'm well aware of everything.

607
00:34:56,289 --> 00:34:57,423
Take good care of our daughter.

608
00:34:58,711 --> 00:34:59,944
It's an order from the god.

609
00:35:00,366 --> 00:35:02,420
It'll be wrong not to follow the order.

610
00:35:07,112 --> 00:35:10,015
If it's god's will
we can't say no to it.

611
00:35:10,091 --> 00:35:10,937
Make it happen.

612
00:35:12,059 --> 00:35:14,191
Sir, why did you summon me?

613
00:35:14,384 --> 00:35:17,456
Nothing much,
you found us the water stream, right...

614
00:35:17,649 --> 00:35:20,002
we found water after digging a well.

615
00:35:20,143 --> 00:35:22,307
We wanted to respect your services
with the first pot of water from that well.

616
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,994
-Congratulations!
-Don't mention it.

617
00:35:28,088 --> 00:35:28,665
Go ahead.

618
00:35:29,837 --> 00:35:32,350
Dear Ariyanachi,
please give that water to Ranasingam.

619
00:35:33,432 --> 00:35:34,276
Go ahead, dear.

620
00:35:39,495 --> 00:35:42,253
-Praise to the Lord!
-Be careful, dear.

621
00:35:42,634 --> 00:35:45,081
Thanks a ton for making it happen.

622
00:35:51,463 --> 00:35:54,137
Listen, pour that water
into the temple's well.

623
00:35:54,555 --> 00:35:56,048
Dear, you accompany him.

624
00:35:57,116 --> 00:35:58,148
Dad, I don't want to go.

625
00:35:58,244 --> 00:36:00,119
It's God's will.
Please go ahead.

626
00:36:00,274 --> 00:36:01,791
You should never disobey god's will.
Please let's go.

627
00:36:02,248 --> 00:36:03,330
If not, god will punish you.

628
00:36:05,866 --> 00:36:09,714
It would've been great
if we were wearing garlands as a couple.

629
00:36:09,956 --> 00:36:11,150
Why didn't your dad think of it?

630
00:36:12,819 --> 00:36:13,672
Stop dreaming.

631
00:36:15,515 --> 00:36:16,636
So, when shall we get married?

632
00:36:16,996 --> 00:36:18,302
You can get married at your will.

633
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,556
Why are you asking
for my permission?

634
00:36:19,985 --> 00:36:21,311
Obviously,
I'm asking my to-be bride.

635
00:36:26,148 --> 00:36:27,276
Ariyanachi, please stop.

636
00:36:28,709 --> 00:36:29,662
You left me behind.

637
00:36:30,113 --> 00:36:33,339
I thought you have beauty queens
waiting in line for you.

638
00:36:33,707 --> 00:36:35,940
Is no one ready
to get married to you?

639
00:36:36,298 --> 00:36:38,619
They're just a crush nothing serious.

640
00:36:39,216 --> 00:36:41,280
But we need someone
to settle down seriously in life.

641
00:36:41,815 --> 00:36:43,890
Even the old hags have refused
to marry you.

642
00:36:44,365 --> 00:36:46,954
But you expect me to keep smiling
and get married to you.

643
00:36:47,506 --> 00:36:48,616
I'm not the one for you.

644
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:54,024
There'll be a day when you'll come
running to me to get married.

645
00:36:54,695 --> 00:36:56,644
-Challenge?
-Challenge accepted!

646
00:36:57,699 --> 00:36:59,878
Listen, instead of day dreaming...

647
00:36:59,949 --> 00:37:02,889
pour that water into the well
and get home safe.

648
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:03,697
Okay?

649
00:37:04,857 --> 00:37:06,397
You're concern for husband
before marriage is flattering.

650
00:37:07,031 --> 00:37:09,564
Don't worry Ariyanachi.
I'll get home safe.

651
00:37:09,825 --> 00:37:11,175
I really don't care
what happens to you.

652
00:37:11,619 --> 00:37:12,920
Ariyanachi Ranasingam!

653
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:15,915
Hey, Ka.Pae. Ranasingam!

654
00:37:31,086 --> 00:37:33,898
We'll protest until
we get the water supply.

655
00:37:34,006 --> 00:37:36,360
Buddy, the Police is here,
shall I deal with it or you'll take care of it?

656
00:37:36,774 --> 00:37:38,476
Ranasingam, we need to talk.

657
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:41,273
We'll protest until
we get the water supply.

658
00:37:41,991 --> 00:37:44,257
Everyone calm down
and listen to your councilor.

659
00:37:45,157 --> 00:37:46,255
-Tell me.
-Ranasingam!

660
00:37:46,718 --> 00:37:48,977
It's better you end the protest.
If not we'll have to step in.

661
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,172
Sir, our folks are protesting
for the sake of our village's problem.

662
00:37:52,397 --> 00:37:53,401
I don't see a problem.

663
00:37:53,764 --> 00:37:56,140
It's a law & order problem.
Public gathering is not allowed.

664
00:37:56,234 --> 00:37:58,117
Law does state
for the public to stay united.

665
00:37:58,231 --> 00:38:00,191
But you're saying otherwise.
I really don't understand.

666
00:38:00,962 --> 00:38:01,615
Please understand.

667
00:38:01,789 --> 00:38:02,877
Sir, why don't you understand.

668
00:38:03,033 --> 00:38:04,556
You're asking to end the protest
for water supply.

669
00:38:04,695 --> 00:38:07,060
If only the Collector comes down to meet,
the entire protest will come to an end.

670
00:38:07,233 --> 00:38:08,304
Why don't you
explain the same to him?

671
00:38:08,796 --> 00:38:09,796
For god sake end the protest.

672
00:38:09,929 --> 00:38:12,757
We'll protest until
we get the water supply.

673
00:38:13,171 --> 00:38:14,945
Ranasingam, we'll have to take action.

674
00:38:15,086 --> 00:38:16,703
-We'll protest until we--
-Please end the protest.

675
00:38:17,165 --> 00:38:19,258
We'll protest until
we get the water supply.

676
00:38:19,499 --> 00:38:20,726
What the hell is happening?

677
00:38:21,024 --> 00:38:23,200
Your village folks
don't seem to listen to us.

678
00:38:23,539 --> 00:38:25,277
They're protesting
blocking the town road.

679
00:38:25,357 --> 00:38:27,820
Aren't you the VO of that village?
Why don't you handle it?

680
00:38:27,945 --> 00:38:30,353
As if they're not aware of it.

681
00:38:30,567 --> 00:38:32,458
If not for just signing
their certificates...

682
00:38:32,585 --> 00:38:33,706
no one will care to respect me.

683
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:35,073
So, respect is all that
matters to you?

684
00:38:35,178 --> 00:38:37,242
Obviously, respect plays a vital role.

685
00:38:37,336 --> 00:38:39,133
Aren't you the Inspector
of that village?

686
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,577
What were doing when such a huge crowd
was gathering for a protest?

687
00:38:41,718 --> 00:38:43,626
Sir, we never knew about the protest.

688
00:38:44,148 --> 00:38:45,656
Do you really think it's possible
to gather a huge overnight?

689
00:38:45,773 --> 00:38:46,911
We'll protest until
we get the water supply.

690
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:50,536
We'll protest until
we get the water supply.

691
00:38:51,455 --> 00:38:53,005
I don't believe that
she's here for the protest.

692
00:38:53,044 --> 00:38:54,028
Watch, she'll come and sit next to me.

693
00:38:54,114 --> 00:38:56,130
We'll protest until
we get the water supply.

694
00:38:56,263 --> 00:38:59,219
We'll protest until
we get the water supply.

695
00:38:59,481 --> 00:39:02,601
We'll protest until
we get the water supply.

696
00:39:02,822 --> 00:39:05,373
We'll protest until
we get the water supply.

697
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,699
We'll protest!

698
00:39:06,795 --> 00:39:08,044
We'll protest until
we get the water supply.

699
00:39:08,318 --> 00:39:09,719
I'm a little busy with personal protest.

700
00:39:09,772 --> 00:39:10,930
Please ignore whatever you see.

701
00:39:11,008 --> 00:39:12,070
We'll protest until
we get the water supply.

702
00:39:12,367 --> 00:39:14,337
Now I get it why you were saving
this space.

703
00:39:14,834 --> 00:39:15,516
Carry on.

704
00:39:15,618 --> 00:39:16,800
We'll protest!

705
00:39:17,072 --> 00:39:18,946
We'll protest until
we get the water supply.

706
00:39:19,158 --> 00:39:21,788
We'll protest until
we get the water supply.

707
00:39:21,853 --> 00:39:24,711
We'll protest until
we get the water supply.

708
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:27,727
We'll protest until
we get the water supply.

709
00:39:28,044 --> 00:39:30,443
Don't be sarcastic and arrogant to them...

710
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:32,311
then you'll end up in prison.

711
00:39:32,818 --> 00:39:36,529
In spite of so many people around
you care for me is flattering.

712
00:39:36,939 --> 00:39:39,316
Even If I get arrested,
won't you bail me out?

713
00:39:56,257 --> 00:39:58,982
Vanakkam, Sir. I tried reasoning
they don't seem to understand.

714
00:39:59,365 --> 00:40:00,670
They're very stubborn!

715
00:40:01,044 --> 00:40:04,348
We'll protest until
we get the water supply.

716
00:40:05,326 --> 00:40:05,827
Vanakkam, sir.

717
00:40:06,568 --> 00:40:07,165
Tell me.

718
00:40:07,479 --> 00:40:08,757
I was told you wanted to
meet me in person.

719
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:11,668
It's 'cause we believe the petitions
we file in your office doesn't reach you.

720
00:40:12,024 --> 00:40:13,621
That's the reason we staged a protest
to lure you out.

721
00:40:13,893 --> 00:40:14,530
We apologize for the inconvenience.

722
00:40:15,505 --> 00:40:17,145
-What's your name?
-Ka. Ranasingam.

723
00:40:17,728 --> 00:40:19,982
Ranasingam, I don't mind coming down
to meet in person.

724
00:40:20,548 --> 00:40:21,703
Of course, it's my duty.

725
00:40:21,876 --> 00:40:25,207
To understand your needs and woes
and convey it to the government.

726
00:40:25,629 --> 00:40:28,012
But instead of considering me
as one of your own...

727
00:40:28,185 --> 00:40:29,273
you see me as
a government official.

728
00:40:29,606 --> 00:40:30,353
That's the issue at hand.

729
00:40:30,633 --> 00:40:32,731
Of course, problem is everywhere
around the world.

730
00:40:32,894 --> 00:40:33,725
Let us come to the point.

731
00:40:34,147 --> 00:40:36,918
What should I do
to end the current protest?

732
00:40:38,023 --> 00:40:38,687
We want water supply.

733
00:40:40,123 --> 00:40:43,077
Ranasingam, making it rain
and agricultural harvesting...

734
00:40:43,267 --> 00:40:44,631
is controlled by mother nature.

735
00:40:45,065 --> 00:40:48,286
How's it going to help
by filing a petition to the government?

736
00:40:49,563 --> 00:40:50,645
Pardon me, collector, sir.

737
00:40:51,697 --> 00:40:53,508
If you clean the lakes and the rivers...

738
00:40:53,781 --> 00:40:55,593
and impose land degradation
and water restoration schemes,

739
00:40:56,557 --> 00:40:59,079
which will help the plants and trees
grow in large numbers.

740
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,685
We believe if that happens,
we're bound to get rain.

741
00:41:01,722 --> 00:41:02,536
What's your qualification?

742
00:41:02,822 --> 00:41:05,919
I'm qualified enough
to take care of my village and our folks.

743
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,183
Good.

744
00:41:08,317 --> 00:41:10,822
One last time trust my word
and end this protest.

745
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:14,333
In two months,
I'll try my best to fulfill your demands.

746
00:41:15,325 --> 00:41:18,271
I'll do everything what you would,
if you're in my shoes.

747
00:41:18,666 --> 00:41:19,659
Thank you, sir. Thanks a lot.

748
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:22,903
-Shall we end the protest?
-Sure, we'll end it.

749
00:41:24,769 --> 00:41:28,948
The Collector has agreed to
fulfill or demands in two months.

750
00:41:29,615 --> 00:41:31,800
So, temporarily our protest
has been victorious.

751
00:41:35,648 --> 00:41:41,020
If by chance, the demands
are not fulfilled in two months...

752
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:43,154
shall we gather
once again to protest?

753
00:41:43,329 --> 00:41:44,704
We shall! We shall!

754
00:41:44,841 --> 00:41:46,402
-We will gather, sir.
-Thank you, you can end it now.

755
00:41:46,552 --> 00:41:47,734
-Keep moving.
-Don't you fear?

756
00:41:48,291 --> 00:41:48,752
Huh?

757
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,072
I asked, don't you fear?

758
00:41:50,626 --> 00:41:52,830
When we know our rights,
fear loses its purpose.

759
00:41:53,234 --> 00:41:56,013
When the authorities learn that
public is aware, then they'll fear us.

760
00:41:56,278 --> 00:41:57,903
Then we can take them by surprise.

761
00:41:58,279 --> 00:41:58,825
What?

762
00:41:59,474 --> 00:42:01,318
-Hey, Ariyanachi!
-My dad's calling...

763
00:42:01,419 --> 00:42:02,838
Looks like your dad
doesn't have manners.

764
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,190
Why don't you ask him yourself?

765
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,078
About manners
or your hand in marriage?

766
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:08,079
-That's up to you.
-Keep moving folks.

767
00:42:08,162 --> 00:42:09,232
Dear, please come over here.

768
00:42:09,369 --> 00:42:11,494
Was the protest for water
or the girl?

769
00:42:11,843 --> 00:42:14,357
-I don't hear you?
-Both are good. It's a victory.

770
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:34,582
How did you know
that my favorite color is red?

771
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,567
You're wardrobe is
mostly filled with red color.

772
00:42:37,693 --> 00:42:38,469
It was obvious.

773
00:42:40,844 --> 00:42:41,781
Fair enough!

774
00:42:42,155 --> 00:42:44,895
What else do you know about me?

775
00:42:46,253 --> 00:42:48,586
-Your bathing soap is, Hamam.
-Damn you!

776
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:50,435
How do you know that?

777
00:42:51,684 --> 00:42:53,118
I noticed when you went to
buy the soap.

778
00:42:55,683 --> 00:42:56,295
What else?

779
00:42:58,421 --> 00:42:59,726
You like to wear glass bangles.

780
00:43:00,607 --> 00:43:01,713
Pond's talcum powder is your favorite.

781
00:43:02,631 --> 00:43:03,558
You're very fond of food.

782
00:43:04,364 --> 00:43:05,388
You like sweets a lot.

783
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:09,133
What else...
You have five baby goats.

784
00:43:10,714 --> 00:43:13,822
Then... you love cricket!

785
00:43:16,187 --> 00:43:16,678
What else?

786
00:43:18,849 --> 00:43:19,733
Obviously you like me!

787
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:20,999
Did I ever tell you?

788
00:43:21,871 --> 00:43:25,336
I just assumed
as everything happened so fast.

789
00:43:33,423 --> 00:43:36,301
Okay, tell me how did you
impress my father?

790
00:43:39,841 --> 00:43:40,594
It is like...

791
00:43:41,107 --> 00:43:44,833
whenever you fall in love with a girl
her father never agrees to it.

792
00:43:45,898 --> 00:43:48,215
So, I pursued you both
at the same time.

793
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:50,419
He was easy to impress.

794
00:43:51,044 --> 00:43:52,134
But you were acting pricey.

795
00:43:54,244 --> 00:43:56,252
You're truly a magician.

796
00:43:56,714 --> 00:43:58,951
I should be careful
while raising a family with you.

797
00:44:02,754 --> 00:44:04,942
You don't have to be cautious.
You can trust me.

798
00:44:05,531 --> 00:44:07,115
What will I get in return
for trusting you?

799
00:44:13,731 --> 00:44:18,809
We can make babies until
you're tired of it.

800
00:44:40,814 --> 00:44:43,048
Hey, brother...
what the hell are you doing?

801
00:44:44,675 --> 00:44:46,461
I thought you wanted
to just speak to her in private.

802
00:44:48,082 --> 00:44:48,814
Yeah, but...

803
00:44:50,607 --> 00:44:51,259
I was tell her a secret.

804
00:44:51,318 --> 00:44:53,466
Why would you do that in private?

805
00:44:54,129 --> 00:44:55,469
Sister-in-law, come on, let's go.

806
00:45:03,928 --> 00:45:04,920
You're my sweetheart.

807
00:45:06,994 --> 00:45:08,958
Son-in-law hope your conversation
went well.

808
00:45:09,067 --> 00:45:10,185
If you give me ten more minutes,
I'll be done.

809
00:45:10,286 --> 00:45:11,646
-Come on, let's go.
-Don't you dare!

810
00:45:11,804 --> 00:45:14,527
Hope the maternal uncles of both
to-be bride and groom agreed to it?

811
00:45:14,613 --> 00:45:15,584
-We do.
-We do!

812
00:45:15,703 --> 00:45:16,467
Sangili what about you?

813
00:45:16,889 --> 00:45:17,443
I agree.

814
00:45:18,197 --> 00:45:20,033
It's an auspicious Vilambi year...

815
00:45:20,087 --> 00:45:21,806
on 5th of January

816
00:45:21,889 --> 00:45:23,222
in the district of Ramanathapuram

817
00:45:23,395 --> 00:45:24,662
Mudugalathur Taluk

818
00:45:24,766 --> 00:45:26,406
residing in the Keezhathoval village

819
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:31,295
Kayamabu Udayammai's son,
Ka. Ranasingam is...

820
00:45:31,416 --> 00:45:34,287
From the district and taluk of Mearpadi...

821
00:45:34,511 --> 00:45:36,335
residing in Mezhathoval village.

822
00:45:36,481 --> 00:45:41,020
Thirukannan Selvarani's daughter,
Ti. Ariyanachi

823
00:45:41,105 --> 00:45:44,182
Between the 9:20-11:00 am

824
00:45:44,397 --> 00:45:49,212
is the auspicious time fixed for the
wedding as per Kumbha-Lagna.

825
00:46:04,676 --> 00:46:06,524
She has become a chatter box.

826
00:46:07,985 --> 00:46:11,033
It's a sin if you don't drink
on auspicious occasions.

827
00:46:11,088 --> 00:46:11,720
That's why I'm buying drinks.

828
00:46:11,752 --> 00:46:13,087
-The bride has arrived.
-She is here.

829
00:46:13,141 --> 00:46:14,798
My daughter-in-law is very beautiful.

830
00:46:28,841 --> 00:46:30,908
Son, don't bend down
to wear the garland.

831
00:46:31,084 --> 00:46:32,540
If you do then you'll be enslaved
to your wife.

832
00:46:32,924 --> 00:46:34,966
As if it's different
if you wear it standing straight.

833
00:46:40,876 --> 00:46:42,134
That's awesome, son-in-law.

834
00:46:42,439 --> 00:46:44,308
You guys never learn from the experienced.

835
00:47:23,118 --> 00:47:26,985
I have no clue about
whom to meet or what to do.

836
00:47:28,234 --> 00:47:32,108
I've lost my dearest son-in-law
who was like a son to me.

837
00:47:32,859 --> 00:47:36,286
To bring back Ranasingam's body...

838
00:47:37,768 --> 00:47:42,467
we need to get a certificate from VO
and Thasildar confirming his residence,

839
00:47:42,647 --> 00:47:45,897
also we need to attach
ID and address proof along with it,

840
00:47:46,081 --> 00:47:47,225
and file a petition with the Collector.

841
00:47:47,453 --> 00:47:49,521
After collector verifies the documents...

842
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:50,537
he'll forward it to,

843
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:57,598
Commissionate of Rehabilitation and
Welfare of Non-Resident Tamils in Chennai.

844
00:47:57,758 --> 00:47:59,226
They will forward it to...

845
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:02,882
Ministry of Indian Overseas affairs
in Delhi.

846
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:06,995
They'll examine the documents
and forward it to the company in Dubai.

847
00:48:07,936 --> 00:48:08,745
After that...

848
00:48:09,735 --> 00:48:12,949
if there are no legal complaints
lodged on Ranasingam,

849
00:48:13,719 --> 00:48:16,788
we can-- we can manage to bring back
his body in a month's time.

850
00:48:17,143 --> 00:48:18,091
It will take one month?

851
00:48:22,368 --> 00:48:26,516
I'm not even blessed to perform
the last rites to my son.

852
00:48:27,524 --> 00:48:30,107
Please somehow bring back my son.

853
00:48:30,705 --> 00:48:32,906
Please bring back my son to me.

854
00:48:35,734 --> 00:48:37,882
Bhai, please do the needful.

855
00:48:38,056 --> 00:48:41,123
There's nothing which
I can do in this matter.

856
00:48:41,768 --> 00:48:43,307
You'll have to execute the entire process.

857
00:48:48,165 --> 00:48:51,133
If you want to bring back
Ranasingam's body...

858
00:48:51,532 --> 00:48:53,792
there'll be a sponsor
traveling along with the deceased.

859
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,521
We'll have to bear
the cost of his flight ticket.

860
00:48:56,596 --> 00:48:58,275
If we calculate the expenses involved...

861
00:48:58,732 --> 00:49:01,676
it will cost you around 3 Lac rupees.

862
00:49:01,801 --> 00:49:02,804
Three lacs?

863
00:49:03,752 --> 00:49:04,523
That's right.

864
00:49:05,444 --> 00:49:07,625
It's not an easy process
to bring back a dead body from abroad.

865
00:49:08,461 --> 00:49:11,076
This is the regular procedure followed.

866
00:49:15,745 --> 00:49:18,892
If you're finding it hard
to arrange for money...

867
00:49:19,684 --> 00:49:20,990
I have another option.

868
00:49:21,194 --> 00:49:23,099
You shouldn't take it in the wrong sense.

869
00:49:23,423 --> 00:49:26,686
That'll cost you 50,000 rupees.

870
00:49:26,923 --> 00:49:30,201
If we inform our men
working out there...

871
00:49:30,364 --> 00:49:31,977
they'll collect the body
from the government out there.

872
00:49:32,772 --> 00:49:34,875
After which there's just one thing
left to do.

873
00:49:35,482 --> 00:49:38,774
We should hire a lawyer
and get an affidavit...

874
00:49:39,001 --> 00:49:41,361
you should sign a NOC (No Objection
Certificate) on 20 rupees stamp paper.

875
00:49:41,542 --> 00:49:44,759
We can send the certificate
and the money to them.

876
00:49:45,184 --> 00:49:48,638
Our men out there
will perform the last rites.

877
00:49:50,814 --> 00:49:55,506
They'll either bury the body
or cremate it.

878
00:49:55,851 --> 00:49:57,851
Who are you?
Who the hell are you to decide?

879
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:00,826
I don't care about the money...

880
00:50:00,904 --> 00:50:02,927
I want to bring back
my husband's body.

881
00:50:04,112 --> 00:50:06,259
My guardian angel should return.

882
00:50:07,931 --> 00:50:10,207
Do you understand?
My guardian angel should return.

883
00:50:10,907 --> 00:50:12,357
-Ariyanachi!
-Dad...

884
00:50:12,516 --> 00:50:17,513
...dad, please don't give up
on my husband.

885
00:50:18,118 --> 00:50:19,525
Dad, please don't give up.

886
00:50:23,131 --> 00:50:24,795
Dad, please do something.

887
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:30,611
Whatever it takes,
I'll bring back my son-in-law.

888
00:50:31,912 --> 00:50:35,154
No matter what it takes
I want to see him again.

889
00:50:35,264 --> 00:50:37,311
Please do something, father-in-law.

890
00:50:40,492 --> 00:50:43,177
Dad, please do something.

891
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,826
Hey, I heard,
Ranasingam's body won't arrive today.

892
00:50:46,163 --> 00:50:47,701
They say it'll take a month
for it to arrive.

893
00:50:47,793 --> 00:50:49,700
It was the same case with
Papanoor's Murugesan.

894
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,264
Bloody sinners, sent over his body
after six month.

895
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:11,241
The living room will be here.
They're about to finish it.

896
00:51:11,445 --> 00:51:13,202
The kitchen will be over there.

897
00:51:13,811 --> 00:51:15,093
Dad is out here,
please speak to him.

898
00:51:15,295 --> 00:51:16,436
Here you go, speak to him.

899
00:51:16,748 --> 00:51:19,278
-Father-in-law.
-How are you? Did you eat?

900
00:51:36,477 --> 00:51:38,986
My husband has done some good deed
or the other for the people...

901
00:51:39,282 --> 00:51:41,197
to remain as a memory to them.

902
00:51:43,853 --> 00:51:45,906
Only a selfless person can...

903
00:51:46,345 --> 00:51:47,719
can make everyone happy.

904
00:51:49,782 --> 00:51:50,914
It's the right thing to
give back her son.

905
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:51,860
It's impossible!

906
00:51:52,014 --> 00:51:54,600
She has no rights over this child.

907
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:55,397
What will you do?

908
00:51:55,752 --> 00:51:58,235
Partner, it's better you remain
a good relative.

909
00:51:58,321 --> 00:52:00,797
Don't indulge in family matters,
it's better you leave.

910
00:52:00,908 --> 00:52:02,485
Hey, don't you get it? Get lost!

911
00:52:03,298 --> 00:52:05,064
-Let's go, son.
-Hey, take your hands off him.

912
00:52:17,555 --> 00:52:18,663
Deepan, come over here.

913
00:52:21,554 --> 00:52:22,217
Hey!

914
00:52:31,195 --> 00:52:32,906
Let go of me, mother. Let me go.

915
00:52:33,186 --> 00:52:34,533
How dare you beat us up?

916
00:52:41,447 --> 00:52:43,945
How dare you beat up our men
in our own village?

917
00:52:44,757 --> 00:52:45,491
Bloody!

918
00:52:50,046 --> 00:52:50,788
Let go!

919
00:52:52,726 --> 00:52:53,351
Let go!

920
00:53:00,215 --> 00:53:02,069
Stop it. Stop it, damn it.

921
00:53:02,342 --> 00:53:02,952
Let go of him.

922
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:03,881
Hey!

923
00:53:56,663 --> 00:53:57,460
Hey!

924
00:54:01,851 --> 00:54:04,763
Partner, don't humiliate us
in front of my people.

925
00:54:06,687 --> 00:54:07,859
Hey, it's hurting.

926
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:10,834
Hey, step aside.

927
00:54:11,771 --> 00:54:15,146
Hey, how dare you beat up my son
and humiliate him?

928
00:54:15,437 --> 00:54:16,201
I won't spare you, damn it!

929
00:54:22,939 --> 00:54:24,140
Sir, they're lying through their teeth.

930
00:54:24,547 --> 00:54:28,007
Not even a year is up
since my husband's demise...

931
00:54:28,171 --> 00:54:32,530
but they've been torturing me
to give up the insurance money.

932
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:35,679
They even claimed that
he was not my husband.

933
00:54:35,817 --> 00:54:38,679
Also they took away
my son from me.

934
00:54:38,836 --> 00:54:44,213
I asked Ranasingam
to help him in this matter.

935
00:54:44,777 --> 00:54:46,009
Sir, she's lying.

936
00:54:46,281 --> 00:54:47,921
She's been longing for a
male companion.

937
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:49,679
If we question her,
she's threatening us with a henchman.

938
00:54:49,871 --> 00:54:51,830
-Who are you?
-Deceased is my brother.

939
00:54:51,994 --> 00:54:53,650
She didn't care
for the people in the house.

940
00:54:53,752 --> 00:54:54,872
And indulged in the shameless act.

941
00:54:54,990 --> 00:54:55,685
Atrocious!

942
00:54:55,719 --> 00:54:56,934
Hey, stop it!

943
00:54:57,693 --> 00:54:59,611
Stop quarreling!

944
00:54:59,819 --> 00:55:01,749
My daughter is telling the truth.

945
00:55:01,894 --> 00:55:04,298
She betrayed my deceased son.

946
00:55:04,687 --> 00:55:06,271
How can some one betray
the dead?

947
00:55:06,491 --> 00:55:07,863
Anyways, that's your problem.

948
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:12,259
Only the wife has the right
to claim the Insurance money.

949
00:55:12,379 --> 00:55:13,820
It's up to her to share the money.

950
00:55:13,944 --> 00:55:14,831
How's that fair to us?

951
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,707
We took loans on interest
to send our brother abroad.

952
00:55:19,364 --> 00:55:20,959
She enjoys strangers company.

953
00:55:21,058 --> 00:55:22,184
They'll lead a merry life.

954
00:55:22,791 --> 00:55:24,463
But we should suffer with
loan repayments.

955
00:55:24,761 --> 00:55:28,129
Hey, keep you concern limited to money.

956
00:55:29,035 --> 00:55:29,957
Don't you dare talk about sister.

957
00:55:30,012 --> 00:55:32,409
What the hell will you do?
I will hack you down to death!

958
00:55:34,528 --> 00:55:35,783
I will hack you down to death.

959
00:55:37,173 --> 00:55:38,988
Hey, calm down people.

960
00:55:39,077 --> 00:55:41,682
Don't forget that you're
fighting in front of a Police officer.

961
00:55:45,604 --> 00:55:50,539
Their brother went abroad
for his studies and her marriage.

962
00:55:51,147 --> 00:55:52,643
He never worried about
his wife or son.

963
00:55:54,077 --> 00:55:56,638
Do you think he knew
about the money before his death?

964
00:55:57,523 --> 00:56:00,709
If they'd knew about it.
They would've killed him earlier.

965
00:56:01,936 --> 00:56:04,713
Listen, at the end of the day,
it's their family affair.

966
00:56:05,159 --> 00:56:06,414
You're a third person don't interfere.

967
00:56:07,508 --> 00:56:08,113
Sir...

968
00:56:09,894 --> 00:56:12,161
ask them hand over the money
which belongs to my sister and her son,

969
00:56:12,747 --> 00:56:15,034
and let them take the rest
and do whatever they want.

970
00:56:16,233 --> 00:56:19,368
Talking ill about my sister
and taking away her son...

971
00:56:19,855 --> 00:56:21,261
if they do such things,
I will not stay silent.

972
00:56:21,323 --> 00:56:22,641
Hey, what the hell will you do?

973
00:56:22,841 --> 00:56:24,723
Hey, don't you understand?

974
00:56:24,973 --> 00:56:26,504
Go. Everyone get out from here.

975
00:56:26,715 --> 00:56:27,535
Everyone get out!

976
00:56:27,559 --> 00:56:30,649
-Mom, let's' go.
-If you think you can getaway...

977
00:56:30,908 --> 00:56:31,806
I won't spare you.

978
00:56:31,923 --> 00:56:33,892
I don't mind dragging this matter
to the court.

979
00:56:34,042 --> 00:56:37,490
I'll make sure to bring you
on the streets like a beggar.

980
00:56:37,856 --> 00:56:38,833
I'm challenging you.

981
00:56:38,993 --> 00:56:39,799
Let's see...

982
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:42,240
She's still screaming, send her outside.

983
00:56:42,391 --> 00:56:43,852
I've encountered worse.

984
00:56:44,018 --> 00:56:46,488
Hey, sign the papers
and return to your village.

985
00:56:47,082 --> 00:56:48,955
If you try and indulge in something else...

986
00:56:49,049 --> 00:56:50,340
I'll skin you alive.

987
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:51,228
Get lost!

988
00:56:56,110 --> 00:57:00,000
Listen, your family won't agree
to Police station's oral verdict.

989
00:57:00,118 --> 00:57:02,908
They'll definitely create problems
to take the money away from you.

990
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:04,886
It's better to
take this matter to the court.

991
00:57:05,444 --> 00:57:06,068
Understood?

992
00:57:07,127 --> 00:57:10,296
Ranasingam, if you start solving
all the issues...

993
00:57:10,687 --> 00:57:12,294
then what are we here for?

994
00:57:13,963 --> 00:57:14,443
Go!

995
00:57:15,196 --> 00:57:16,747
If you continue this arrogance...

996
00:57:17,084 --> 00:57:18,323
one day I'll find a way to break it.

997
00:57:18,598 --> 00:57:19,038
Get lost!

998
00:57:21,337 --> 00:57:23,291
Ranasingam, please go.

999
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:24,994
-Constable?
-Yes, sir.

1000
00:57:25,327 --> 00:57:26,872
Has he finished passport verification?

1001
00:57:27,135 --> 00:57:28,446
He's not interested in going abroad...

1002
00:57:28,556 --> 00:57:30,565
he's adamant on doing agriculture.

1003
00:57:30,768 --> 00:57:32,124
He has never applied for a passport.

1004
00:57:32,571 --> 00:57:34,934
Brother how much is, 33 multiplied 28?

1005
00:57:36,055 --> 00:57:36,649
How much?

1006
00:57:37,916 --> 00:57:38,947
It's 924.

1007
00:57:39,525 --> 00:57:40,837
It's 927.

1008
00:57:41,549 --> 00:57:42,806
924 is the correct answer.

1009
00:57:43,101 --> 00:57:46,588
Buddy, I'm returning from
MLA's office.

1010
00:57:46,805 --> 00:57:50,266
I heard they're going to impose
144 rule in our village.

1011
00:57:50,516 --> 00:57:51,838
-144?
-Yes.

1012
00:57:52,208 --> 00:57:53,208
Why the hell are they imposing it?

1013
00:57:53,446 --> 00:57:57,430
Obviously, 'cause they're going to
announce there will be no sharing of water.

1014
00:57:57,547 --> 00:57:58,788
What will people do
if they hear about it?

1015
00:57:58,930 --> 00:57:59,611
They'll be outraged.

1016
00:57:59,838 --> 00:58:01,838
So, this 144 is a
preemptive strike on us.

1017
00:58:02,002 --> 00:58:04,506
Who are they to decide
what's good or bad for our village?

1018
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,757
The person who passes this bill...

1019
00:58:08,062 --> 00:58:10,062
should bring his wife
and live out here.

1020
00:58:10,554 --> 00:58:14,679
Then he'll realize the pain of our women
who push water-carts for miles.

1021
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:16,658
It's unfair to impose
curfew for demanding water.

1022
00:58:16,864 --> 00:58:18,533
Let them impose curfew,
we'll show them what we're capable of.

1023
00:58:18,688 --> 00:58:19,955
She's right about the matter.

1024
00:58:20,084 --> 00:58:22,204
They can't enter our village
asking for votes after doing such a thing.

1025
00:58:22,283 --> 00:58:23,640
If they do we'll kick the away.

1026
00:58:23,687 --> 00:58:26,574
You're right.
How long do we stay oppressed?

1027
00:58:26,758 --> 00:58:28,643
We'll challenge the Police's gun.

1028
00:58:28,753 --> 00:58:32,319
This haste and rage
is the reason for the oppression.

1029
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:35,023
Government introduces schemes
for the bosses...

1030
00:58:35,565 --> 00:58:36,585
and we'll protest against it.

1031
00:58:37,206 --> 00:58:38,807
Then we drag the case
to the court.

1032
00:58:39,484 --> 00:58:41,484
We await hoping
that the court will serve justice.

1033
00:58:41,892 --> 00:58:44,252
They keep dragging the case at the court.

1034
00:58:44,715 --> 00:58:45,970
We'll eventually grow old.

1035
00:58:46,303 --> 00:58:48,730
The schemes which we rejected...

1036
00:58:48,997 --> 00:58:51,078
landed on our children
without our knowledge.

1037
00:58:51,869 --> 00:58:52,572
Am I right or not?

1038
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:55,557
You think you can even touch them?

1039
00:58:56,273 --> 00:58:58,778
You'll still end up voting for them,
'cause he's from your caste.

1040
00:58:59,267 --> 00:59:00,092
Am I right?

1041
00:59:01,328 --> 00:59:01,921
Then?

1042
00:59:03,451 --> 00:59:06,741
In the name caste and religion
they'll write us off.

1043
00:59:07,729 --> 00:59:10,084
Like how they're keen on
defeating our purpose.

1044
00:59:10,768 --> 00:59:13,069
We should be well aware of
our needs.

1045
00:59:24,181 --> 00:59:26,291
-Tell me.
-I knew this would happen.

1046
00:59:27,768 --> 00:59:30,470
What happened?
You're cheerful all the time.

1047
00:59:30,684 --> 00:59:31,459
Why are you sulking now?

1048
00:59:32,565 --> 00:59:33,652
-They've ruined it.

1049
00:59:33,691 --> 00:59:34,345
Now, what about the wedding?

1050
00:59:34,387 --> 00:59:36,478
Doesn't matter, you just come home.

1051
00:59:36,777 --> 00:59:38,311
You're already my wife.
We don't need someone to officiate.

1052
00:59:38,403 --> 00:59:39,993
See, even you don't have any hope.

1053
00:59:40,198 --> 00:59:41,494
That was not my intention.

1054
00:59:41,790 --> 00:59:42,845
Give the phone to your father.
Don't cry.

1055
00:59:45,343 --> 00:59:46,705
-Father-in-law.
-Tell me, son-in-law.

1056
00:59:46,852 --> 00:59:47,795
Do exactly as I say.

1057
01:00:01,009 --> 01:00:02,009
Ladies, stop right there.

1058
01:00:02,169 --> 01:00:03,665
Why are you out so late
in the night?

1059
01:00:03,853 --> 01:00:05,580
Do you think we're lurking around?

1060
01:00:05,816 --> 01:00:07,728
We need water.
May be you can fetch it for us.

1061
01:00:07,970 --> 01:00:08,713
We'll return home.

1062
01:00:08,806 --> 01:00:10,189
Always ready with excuses!

1063
01:00:10,244 --> 01:00:11,378
-Go!
-We know that.

1064
01:01:45,483 --> 01:01:48,295
Did the collector
really asked you to meet him?

1065
01:01:48,474 --> 01:01:50,466
Yes. I had invited him
for my wedding...

1066
01:01:50,786 --> 01:01:52,169
he felt bad for not have attended
the wedding.

1067
01:01:52,274 --> 01:01:54,678
He wanted to meet us in person.
That's why I and my wife are here.

1068
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:55,802
Sir has arrived.

1069
01:01:57,263 --> 01:01:59,742
Honey, is collector really your friend?

1070
01:02:00,394 --> 01:02:02,855
When the Police can be our friends,
why not collector too?

1071
01:02:05,484 --> 01:02:07,252
Don't you think collector
looks like Rajinikanth?

1072
01:02:08,427 --> 01:02:09,138
Good morning, sir.

1073
01:02:11,838 --> 01:02:12,513
Ranasingam?

1074
01:02:13,177 --> 01:02:13,544
Yes, sir.

1075
01:02:13,887 --> 01:02:15,864
-Got married?
-We got married last night.

1076
01:02:16,155 --> 01:02:18,515
-Why during the night?
-'Cause you imposed 144!

1077
01:02:18,612 --> 01:02:19,660
Curfew was in full swing.

1078
01:02:19,726 --> 01:02:21,299
So, wedding during the day
was impossible.

1079
01:02:21,454 --> 01:02:23,763
So we had to get married
in hiding.

1080
01:02:24,142 --> 01:02:25,604
It's a different case,
if I were a Govt. employee...

1081
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:26,990
I can choose
to defer my promises.

1082
01:02:27,196 --> 01:02:28,523
-Hello, mister!
-For me, my word is important

1083
01:02:28,577 --> 01:02:29,054
Hold on!

1084
01:02:30,668 --> 01:02:32,951
144 was imposed for a different reason.

1085
01:02:33,151 --> 01:02:34,551
It was not meant to stall your wedding.

1086
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:38,821
According to me,
promises should not be broken.

1087
01:02:39,491 --> 01:02:41,204
Doesn't matter
if it was said in private...

1088
01:02:41,636 --> 01:02:43,293
or it was said during a public meeting.

1089
01:02:44,357 --> 01:02:46,399
Ranasingam, there's no room
for excuses in this matter.

1090
01:02:46,978 --> 01:02:49,023
And everyone in the country...

1091
01:02:49,134 --> 01:02:53,510
are not as honest as you
when it comes to protest.

1092
01:02:53,869 --> 01:02:55,075
But the reality is different.

1093
01:02:55,598 --> 01:02:58,688
By the way, the time given
by the people is not over yet.

1094
01:02:59,106 --> 01:03:00,974
You will have your demands fulfilled.

1095
01:03:01,355 --> 01:03:05,306
I respect the notion
of fighting for your people.

1096
01:03:05,578 --> 01:03:06,625
-Congratulations on the marriage.
-Thank you.

1097
01:03:06,931 --> 01:03:08,189
All the best for your new beginning.

1098
01:03:08,351 --> 01:03:09,492
-I'll take care of this problem.
-Thank you, sir.

1099
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:10,527
What's your name?

1100
01:03:10,812 --> 01:03:11,528
Ariyanachi!

1101
01:03:12,186 --> 01:03:12,866
Shake hands.

1102
01:03:13,947 --> 01:03:15,310
-Ariyanachi Ranasingam.
-Delighted!

1103
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:32,731
What are you thinking about
Ariyanachi?

1104
01:03:34,061 --> 01:03:37,356
Looking at your concern
in regards to people of this village...

1105
01:03:37,521 --> 01:03:39,755
I thought you took
equal care of your own family too,

1106
01:03:40,068 --> 01:03:41,505
and have been jobless.

1107
01:03:42,598 --> 01:03:43,231
I don't understand.

1108
01:03:43,324 --> 01:03:46,410
Hey, before indulging social service...

1109
01:03:46,832 --> 01:03:51,552
you should make sure your friends,
family and relatives are safe and sound.

1110
01:03:52,069 --> 01:03:54,108
If they're not happy...
Look here...

1111
01:03:54,482 --> 01:03:56,997
then make sure to tend
to their needs as priority.

1112
01:03:57,145 --> 01:04:00,090
You shouldn't let them starve
at the cost of people's welfare.

1113
01:04:02,554 --> 01:04:03,849
Who's been starving at this house?

1114
01:04:04,443 --> 01:04:05,443
Didn't you eat? Are you hungry?

1115
01:04:07,052 --> 01:04:08,358
Where's mom, dad and sister?

1116
01:04:09,723 --> 01:04:12,678
Mom and sister are staying at
aunt's place.

1117
01:04:13,778 --> 01:04:15,309
Dad's sleeping on the porch.

1118
01:04:16,371 --> 01:04:19,410
You and I are settled here
for an important matter...

1119
01:04:19,974 --> 01:04:20,833
So, we're the reason behind it.

1120
01:04:21,091 --> 01:04:23,903
Hey, before marriage
I used to sleep on the porch.

1121
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:25,677
You can afford to sleep
wherever you feel like.

1122
01:04:25,872 --> 01:04:28,803
It doesn't look good,
if a young girl has to sleep elsewhere.

1123
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,106
What is your problem?

1124
01:04:32,739 --> 01:04:36,075
Build a house which can accommodate
our entire family.

1125
01:04:44,661 --> 01:04:45,115
Okay.

1126
01:04:47,138 --> 01:04:48,082
We'll start the construction tomorrow.

1127
01:04:48,631 --> 01:04:49,216
Okay?

1128
01:04:49,529 --> 01:04:52,067
Hey, stop kidding.
I'm very serious about it.

1129
01:04:52,191 --> 01:04:53,737
I'm serious about it too.

1130
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:55,376
Because...

1131
01:04:56,542 --> 01:05:01,771
I feel really proud of my wife, who cares
about the family on the wedding night.

1132
01:05:06,401 --> 01:05:08,377
Now, what I am about to say...

1133
01:05:08,776 --> 01:05:12,401
you might think I'm desperate
for the wedding night.

1134
01:05:13,081 --> 01:05:13,605
Okay?

1135
01:05:14,699 --> 01:05:16,996
No one in my family
has ever thought about it...

1136
01:05:17,151 --> 01:05:18,761
nor have questioned me
about responsibilities.

1137
01:05:19,386 --> 01:05:20,885
This is the first time someone has
questioned me.

1138
01:05:21,019 --> 01:05:22,858
Now sit back and watch
things will set in motion.

1139
01:05:23,894 --> 01:05:25,956
Things which are supposed to happen...

1140
01:05:26,066 --> 01:05:28,253
should happen right away,
if not it'll be considered as a sin.

1141
01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:30,121
-What do you mean?
-Wedding night!

1142
01:05:30,990 --> 01:05:32,513
Isn't that supposed to happen
right now?

1143
01:05:33,270 --> 01:05:34,082
I think you didn't understand.

1144
01:05:34,934 --> 01:05:36,058
I understood it well.

1145
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:38,347
But you don't seem to get my point.

1146
01:05:38,692 --> 01:05:39,450
Hold on a minute.

1147
01:05:40,013 --> 01:05:42,599
There's camera everywhere.
So, we gotta be careful.

1148
01:05:42,887 --> 01:05:44,582
You still haven't understood
my point.

1149
01:05:44,848 --> 01:05:49,256
People will talk. They'll accuse me
of chasing away the family.

1150
01:05:49,802 --> 01:05:50,325
Really?

1151
01:05:50,551 --> 01:05:52,370
-Who said it? Who dared to speak?
-Calm down.

1152
01:05:52,566 --> 01:05:54,582
Who the hell was it? Come forward.

1153
01:05:54,706 --> 01:05:56,628
Let me find out
who's talking behind my back.

1154
01:05:56,746 --> 01:05:59,050
When I don't let the problems
of the people slide...

1155
01:05:59,136 --> 01:06:00,388
I won't sit idle,
'cause it's my family matter.

1156
01:06:00,590 --> 01:06:01,878
That too it's a huge issue.

1157
01:06:02,004 --> 01:06:04,918
This has never happened in my family
during the wedding night.

1158
01:06:05,418 --> 01:06:07,066
I can't let this slide.
Let's find out who's the culprit.

1159
01:06:07,193 --> 01:06:10,513
Don't worry, sit down.
We'll discuss the matter in detail.

1160
01:06:14,265 --> 01:06:15,186
What happened Ariyanachi?

1161
01:06:15,897 --> 01:06:16,764
Sit down. Let's discuss.

1162
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:19,879
Ariyanachi come on let's discuss.

1163
01:06:20,005 --> 01:06:21,895
-Hey let it go.
-Please, let's talk.

1164
01:06:22,139 --> 01:06:24,311
I said, let it go.
Let it go, damn it.

1165
01:06:32,430 --> 01:06:33,375
Ariyanachi!

1166
01:06:35,094 --> 01:06:35,928
Is that all?

1167
01:06:48,313 --> 01:06:49,272
Why are you standing up?

1168
01:06:50,272 --> 01:06:51,384
It's 'cause I'm all riled up.

1169
01:06:52,343 --> 01:06:53,202
Doesn't matter anymore.

1170
01:08:27,577 --> 01:08:30,663
Listen, if I come to know
that you guys were being a nuisance...

1171
01:08:30,804 --> 01:08:31,601
I'll skin you guys alive.

1172
01:08:31,795 --> 01:08:33,154
Finish all the rites and disperse.

1173
01:08:33,342 --> 01:08:33,878
Okay, sir.

1174
01:08:38,209 --> 01:08:38,850
Let's go.

1175
01:08:42,770 --> 01:08:46,228
If Ellaisamy was present
this wouldn't be the case.

1176
01:08:46,959 --> 01:08:49,225
He would've never let it happen.

1177
01:08:49,593 --> 01:08:55,331
[Death Folk song]

1178
01:09:12,881 --> 01:09:14,284
Doesn't matter if the person
is good or bad...

1179
01:09:15,765 --> 01:09:17,687
their last breath should be
at their native.

1180
01:09:18,895 --> 01:09:22,624
No matter how much we earn,
we can't take it to our grave.

1181
01:09:48,944 --> 01:09:50,402
Doesn't matter if the person
is good or bad...

1182
01:09:51,098 --> 01:09:52,934
their last breath should be
at their native.

1183
01:09:54,177 --> 01:09:57,660
No matter how much we earn,
we can't take it to our grave.

1184
01:10:00,672 --> 01:10:01,913
Dad, open your mouth.

1185
01:10:03,061 --> 01:10:05,053
-Son, what is this?
-You've fed me all these years.

1186
01:10:05,334 --> 01:10:07,122
I feel like it, 'cause I'll be away.
Just this once.

1187
01:10:11,294 --> 01:10:11,801
Come on, mom.

1188
01:10:17,232 --> 01:10:18,825
Maayi, open your mouth.

1189
01:10:22,826 --> 01:10:23,732
You're such a cutie.

1190
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:25,554
Open your mouth.

1191
01:10:27,654 --> 01:10:28,654
I thought as much.

1192
01:10:28,976 --> 01:10:31,483
Hey, if you wanted to feed your wife,
so be it.

1193
01:10:31,765 --> 01:10:33,959
Don't use us as an excuse.

1194
01:10:34,060 --> 01:10:35,747
-Dad, look what he's doing.
-He's going away, dear.

1195
01:10:35,937 --> 01:10:37,194
So, he's expressing his love
by feeding us.

1196
01:10:37,310 --> 01:10:38,560
You really believe him?

1197
01:10:39,537 --> 01:10:40,272
Mother-in-law, open your mouth.

1198
01:10:40,685 --> 01:10:42,467
-Hey, stop this nonsense.
-Why?

1199
01:10:42,694 --> 01:10:44,678
He's being silly
and you're encouraging him.

1200
01:10:44,913 --> 01:10:47,014
-Give me that.
-Hold on, my mom made it.

1201
01:10:51,363 --> 01:10:51,848
Take it.

1202
01:10:52,859 --> 01:10:53,570
Here you go, mother-in-law.

1203
01:10:55,264 --> 01:10:57,537
-Send me a package to Dubai.
-Sure, I will send it across.

1204
01:10:57,929 --> 01:10:58,592
Wipe your hands.

1205
01:11:01,910 --> 01:11:02,981
Before I head to Dubai...

1206
01:11:03,546 --> 01:11:06,428
as your elder brother
I'm giving you an advice.

1207
01:11:06,654 --> 01:11:07,427
What is it?

1208
01:11:08,039 --> 01:11:11,484
If you're bored during your classes...

1209
01:11:11,929 --> 01:11:15,322
bunk college and watch a movie
at the theater.

1210
01:11:15,601 --> 01:11:16,780
That's a worst advice coming from
a brother.

1211
01:11:17,593 --> 01:11:18,805
Sister-in-law, look what he's saying.

1212
01:11:19,088 --> 01:11:21,999
-Are you crazy?
-She's going to do that anyways.

1213
01:11:22,179 --> 01:11:22,978
So, there's nothing wrong in it.

1214
01:11:23,024 --> 01:11:24,522
Dad, he's troubling me again.

1215
01:11:24,577 --> 01:11:25,460
Please take care of my sister.

1216
01:11:25,803 --> 01:11:28,889
We took good care of ourselves
even before your wife arrived.

1217
01:11:29,451 --> 01:11:30,436
Don't over do it.

1218
01:11:30,733 --> 01:11:31,678
He's irritating me, dad.

1219
01:11:32,164 --> 01:11:33,828
Let it go.
After all he's your brother.

1220
01:11:34,264 --> 01:11:35,609
Look, keep up this annoying face.

1221
01:11:35,898 --> 01:11:38,374
I don't want you
to start crying once I leave.

1222
01:11:40,288 --> 01:11:40,936
Look, you started already.

1223
01:11:41,816 --> 01:11:42,654
Why should I cry?

1224
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:44,694
-I can see the tears rolling.
-I'm not crying.

1225
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:46,771
-I won't cry 'cause you're leaving.
-Cry baby.

1226
01:11:46,873 --> 01:11:47,835
Sister-in-law, I'm going to beat him.

1227
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:49,310
I swear,
I'm going to beat him up.

1228
01:11:49,603 --> 01:11:50,385
Calm down, dear.

1229
01:11:50,708 --> 01:11:54,013
-Kinsmen... please come over here.
-Dad, he's making me cry.

1230
01:11:54,098 --> 01:11:54,949
Let's go.

1231
01:11:55,261 --> 01:11:57,207
Nachi dear, go ahead...

1232
01:11:57,338 --> 01:11:58,444
go ahead and speak with son-in-law.

1233
01:11:59,067 --> 01:11:59,918
Go ahead, son-in-law.

1234
01:12:03,424 --> 01:12:04,503
Honey, why are you crying?

1235
01:12:05,463 --> 01:12:07,533
It'll take two years for me...

1236
01:12:08,682 --> 01:12:09,675
to see my child.

1237
01:12:10,636 --> 01:12:12,338
How can I just leave saying goodbye.

1238
01:12:16,575 --> 01:12:19,169
So, what else my dear, wife?

1239
01:12:21,378 --> 01:12:25,383
Listen, don't forget to have
your meals on time.

1240
01:12:25,672 --> 01:12:26,344
Okay.

1241
01:12:26,717 --> 01:12:28,397
People say it's really hot out there...

1242
01:12:29,121 --> 01:12:30,700
please regularly take oil bath.

1243
01:12:32,740 --> 01:12:36,765
You're worried as if
I was living in a cold region.

1244
01:12:37,295 --> 01:12:38,919
Our village has been rated for being
the hottest region.

1245
01:12:39,123 --> 01:12:41,185
That's why electricity companies are here
to extract power.

1246
01:12:42,309 --> 01:12:43,287
Thought as much.

1247
01:12:43,913 --> 01:12:47,676
If Ranasingam doesn't counters
the responses...

1248
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:51,449
the entire district of Ramanathapuram
will be depraved of him.

1249
01:12:52,972 --> 01:12:55,858
Didn't you say that you loved the way
I speak?

1250
01:12:56,419 --> 01:12:57,379
I did say.

1251
01:12:57,839 --> 01:13:00,049
Instead being beside during my pregnancy...

1252
01:13:00,128 --> 01:13:01,892
you're abandoning a pregnant women.

1253
01:13:02,292 --> 01:13:05,026
What should I say, when your kid asks
"Where's my dad?"

1254
01:13:05,253 --> 01:13:06,909
Do you not want me to go
abroad now?

1255
01:13:08,487 --> 01:13:12,194
As if, that's going to stop you from going.

1256
01:13:24,130 --> 01:13:26,145
Sir, where's the 6th booth?

1257
01:13:26,554 --> 01:13:27,193
Over there.

1258
01:13:34,513 --> 01:13:36,685
Madam, where should we submit
the petition for death certificate?

1259
01:13:36,929 --> 01:13:37,761
It's over there.

1260
01:13:46,561 --> 01:13:48,476
-What is it?
-We have to file a petition.

1261
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:50,921
Please, sit down.

1262
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:02,537
Who's Ariyanachi?

1263
01:14:03,241 --> 01:14:04,003
That's me.

1264
01:14:13,959 --> 01:14:15,451
I can't find any important documents.

1265
01:14:15,497 --> 01:14:17,896
Sir, we've attached all the documents.

1266
01:14:19,178 --> 01:14:22,249
There are no documents
which confirms she's deceased's wife.

1267
01:14:22,966 --> 01:14:26,288
Sir, it has photocopies
of Aadhar card and ration card.

1268
01:14:28,848 --> 01:14:31,678
Ration card won't even hold validity
beyond the state.

1269
01:14:33,364 --> 01:14:36,247
Validity of Aadhar card
is unknown to the court...

1270
01:14:36,623 --> 01:14:37,615
neither we're aware of it.

1271
01:14:38,418 --> 01:14:40,987
Even on passport it doesn't prove
that she's deceased's wife.

1272
01:14:41,191 --> 01:14:43,335
Her name was not added under
the spouse section.

1273
01:14:44,514 --> 01:14:47,200
If the documents provided
by you people leaves the country...

1274
01:14:47,561 --> 01:14:49,512
all of it will be invalid and discarded.

1275
01:14:49,576 --> 01:14:52,841
Sir, we didn't even take
a photograph on the day of the wedding.

1276
01:14:53,457 --> 01:14:55,779
As there were protests,
a curfew was imposed.

1277
01:14:56,808 --> 01:14:58,826
Even the wedding took place
during the night.

1278
01:15:01,482 --> 01:15:03,848
People abroad
won't agree with your stories.

1279
01:15:04,726 --> 01:15:07,113
In our country we have something called,
marriage certificate.

1280
01:15:07,468 --> 01:15:08,452
That's the only valid document.

1281
01:15:08,618 --> 01:15:10,491
If you have that,
please get it. If not please leave.

1282
01:15:10,555 --> 01:15:12,641
Sir, the deceased is my brother.

1283
01:15:13,875 --> 01:15:16,053
I'm his sister, you can take my word.

1284
01:15:16,172 --> 01:15:17,523
She's my sister-in-law.

1285
01:15:17,663 --> 01:15:20,273
Fine, then why don't you claim the body?

1286
01:15:21,109 --> 01:15:22,913
Bring me the proof which confirms
you're deceased's sister.

1287
01:15:23,788 --> 01:15:24,491
I'll issue the certificate.

1288
01:15:26,453 --> 01:15:30,234
Sir, we have no clue in how to proceed
with this matter.

1289
01:15:30,678 --> 01:15:32,054
Please help us.

1290
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:35,491
Listen, I'm here to do my duty.

1291
01:15:35,806 --> 01:15:38,938
I'm not person
who fancies social work.

1292
01:15:40,219 --> 01:15:42,851
They get married illegally
and then trouble us with problems.

1293
01:15:45,546 --> 01:15:46,100
Sir...

1294
01:15:47,686 --> 01:15:48,819
what exactly do you need?

1295
01:15:49,922 --> 01:15:50,922
Don't get angry.

1296
01:15:51,609 --> 01:15:54,023
If I agree to your claim
and relieve the dead body...

1297
01:15:54,616 --> 01:15:55,616
what if another lady comes forward?

1298
01:15:56,515 --> 01:15:58,858
And is she claims to be
the deceased's wife...

1299
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:00,289
I'll be in trouble.

1300
01:16:02,756 --> 01:16:05,515
I can't be investigating
who's deceased's wife.

1301
01:16:06,509 --> 01:16:07,610
I'm not an undertaker.

1302
01:16:08,186 --> 01:16:10,327
It's annoying and has become
a routine every month...

1303
01:16:10,461 --> 01:16:11,695
claiming for dead bodies.

1304
01:16:12,703 --> 01:16:14,218
Is this collector's office
or a mortuary?

1305
01:16:14,703 --> 01:16:15,382
Okay, sir.

1306
01:16:17,849 --> 01:16:19,342
I'll return with necessary documents.

1307
01:16:21,069 --> 01:16:22,237
Come on, let's go.

1308
01:16:34,177 --> 01:16:35,667
-Vanakkam, sir.
-Welcome.

1309
01:16:39,635 --> 01:16:41,034
Ariyanachi's husband...

1310
01:16:41,143 --> 01:16:43,775
I've already issued a certificate
that he's related to you.

1311
01:16:44,206 --> 01:16:45,206
What else do you want?

1312
01:16:46,128 --> 01:16:50,964
Sir, the collector's office
demanded for a marriage certificate.

1313
01:16:52,807 --> 01:16:56,964
I need a certificate to send Dubai
confirming I'm Ranasingam's wife.

1314
01:16:57,373 --> 01:16:59,613
Who advised you to approach
VO's office for this matter?

1315
01:17:01,448 --> 01:17:02,737
Bring me the person who advised you.

1316
01:17:03,183 --> 01:17:05,441
It's become a habit of them
pushing their work on to us.

1317
01:17:05,980 --> 01:17:09,112
Officials out there
has no clue about their jobs.

1318
01:17:09,706 --> 01:17:12,549
Listen, I have no authority
on this matter.

1319
01:17:12,824 --> 01:17:14,120
Even if I issue a certificate
it will be invalid.

1320
01:17:14,401 --> 01:17:16,745
Marriage has to be registered
at the Registrar office.

1321
01:17:17,121 --> 01:17:19,807
Or at least you should get
an affidavit notarized.

1322
01:17:19,892 --> 01:17:20,759
Only those documents are valid.

1323
01:17:21,026 --> 01:17:22,869
Please go and check back with
Collector office.

1324
01:17:23,667 --> 01:17:24,972
Tell me, madam. How can I help?

1325
01:17:25,056 --> 01:17:27,947
I'm here to get the marriage certificate
for my sister-in-law.

1326
01:17:28,268 --> 01:17:29,557
Do you have all the required
documents?

1327
01:17:30,058 --> 01:17:33,314
Sir, four years ago
the wedding happened in a hurry.

1328
01:17:33,557 --> 01:17:35,072
So, we don't have any proof.

1329
01:17:35,269 --> 01:17:37,978
Oh, love marriage is it?
Did you guys elope and get married?

1330
01:17:38,086 --> 01:17:41,198
Not an issue.
Do you have the wedding invitation?

1331
01:17:42,142 --> 01:17:42,844
No.

1332
01:17:45,190 --> 01:17:46,767
Do you have a receipt of the
wedding hall?

1333
01:17:48,095 --> 01:17:48,602
No.

1334
01:17:51,964 --> 01:17:54,776
Is there a photograph from that night?

1335
01:17:54,947 --> 01:17:55,901
Or you don't have that either?

1336
01:17:57,416 --> 01:18:00,190
How do you expect me to issue
a marriage certificate without any proof?

1337
01:18:00,931 --> 01:18:03,860
It's better you bring your husband
over here tomorrow morning.

1338
01:18:04,228 --> 01:18:08,096
I'll make it look that you got married
over here and will register it online.

1339
01:18:08,581 --> 01:18:09,768
You'll get your certificate in 15 days.

1340
01:18:09,908 --> 01:18:10,839
-Get me two fritters.
-Okay, sir.

1341
01:18:12,174 --> 01:18:14,151
Please make sure to bring 3000 rupees,
when you're here tomorrow.

1342
01:18:14,862 --> 01:18:15,588
I'll sort it out.

1343
01:18:16,868 --> 01:18:20,822
Sir, brother was working abroad...

1344
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:22,585
and he died over there.

1345
01:18:24,673 --> 01:18:25,329
What?

1346
01:18:25,909 --> 01:18:27,987
In order to bring back my brother's body...

1347
01:18:28,479 --> 01:18:29,808
we had visited collector's office.

1348
01:18:29,932 --> 01:18:31,815
But they've asked to submit
the marriage certificate.

1349
01:18:32,235 --> 01:18:33,462
So, your brother is deceased?

1350
01:18:37,555 --> 01:18:40,823
No proof of marriage neither the person is alive.
How can I issue a certificate?

1351
01:18:42,105 --> 01:18:43,542
As per the law, this is illegal.

1352
01:18:44,439 --> 01:18:45,017
Sir...

1353
01:18:46,964 --> 01:18:50,324
the wedding took place
and I have a child from that marriage.

1354
01:18:50,659 --> 01:18:52,831
Sir, for god sake
please issue a certificate.

1355
01:18:53,495 --> 01:18:54,181
Please, sir.

1356
01:18:54,690 --> 01:18:55,369
I understand.

1357
01:18:55,753 --> 01:18:58,972
Legally issued marriage certificates
for the people who are alive...

1358
01:18:59,019 --> 01:19:00,480
itself has attracted lot of issues.

1359
01:19:01,159 --> 01:19:03,338
How can I issue an illegal certificate?

1360
01:19:04,799 --> 01:19:06,892
It won't work out. Please, leave.

1361
01:19:11,526 --> 01:19:13,737
Sir, we don't mind spending
more money...

1362
01:19:14,196 --> 01:19:15,735
but we need the marriage certificate.

1363
01:19:16,369 --> 01:19:17,845
Are you trying to bribe me?

1364
01:19:18,276 --> 01:19:20,244
-Shall I call the police?
-Sir, that was not my intention.

1365
01:19:20,463 --> 01:19:22,596
I was being courteous
because of your situation.

1366
01:19:22,761 --> 01:19:24,471
But you're bribing me. Get out!

1367
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:30,160
Phew!

1368
01:19:31,096 --> 01:19:34,252
Listen, there are lawyers
who are experts in these matters...

1369
01:19:34,391 --> 01:19:36,484
they can help you with your problem.
Go and meet them.

1370
01:20:25,021 --> 01:20:28,399
Uncle, Ranasingam's body
has been dispatched from Dubai.

1371
01:20:30,054 --> 01:20:32,546
Hello, I'm Vinoth from Ramanathapuram...

1372
01:20:32,697 --> 01:20:33,804
when was the body dispatched?

1373
01:20:35,126 --> 01:20:36,625
Do you have any idea
when it will arrive?

1374
01:20:37,383 --> 01:20:39,781
-Vinoth, is this news confirmed?
-Yes.

1375
01:20:41,391 --> 01:20:43,461
I know people out there.
Let me check with them.

1376
01:20:43,601 --> 01:20:45,023
Do you remember, Chandran?

1377
01:20:45,569 --> 01:20:46,569
Ranasingam's colleague.

1378
01:20:47,085 --> 01:20:47,922
He gave me the information.

1379
01:20:59,849 --> 01:21:02,317
Vinoth, who spoke from Dubai?

1380
01:21:02,935 --> 01:21:04,302
It was Chandran who informed me.

1381
01:21:04,810 --> 01:21:06,173
But, now he's not picking up the phone.

1382
01:21:06,787 --> 01:21:08,114
Now, who do we contact?

1383
01:21:11,156 --> 01:21:13,235
Once they're closer to the village,
we'll inform everyone.

1384
01:21:13,376 --> 01:21:15,110
-No idea, dad.
-Last time it was a chaos.

1385
01:21:18,888 --> 01:21:21,053
This girl's fate is cursed.

1386
01:21:21,647 --> 01:21:25,078
They've been torturing her soul
by delaying the process.

1387
01:21:26,122 --> 01:21:28,365
I wonder when this torture
is going to end.

1388
01:21:34,372 --> 01:21:35,043
Gopal...

1389
01:21:36,404 --> 01:21:37,304
call me if you need anything.

1390
01:21:38,464 --> 01:21:39,388
I'll be at home.

1391
01:21:39,966 --> 01:21:43,907
Uncle, if I hear from Dubai,
will inform you right away.

1392
01:22:02,372 --> 01:22:03,114
Give me that file.

1393
01:22:04,747 --> 01:22:06,419
I've already discussed with
Sub-Registrar office.

1394
01:22:06,725 --> 01:22:10,185
If you had paid me a day before,
we would've got the marriage certificate.

1395
01:22:10,295 --> 01:22:12,052
It took sometime to arrange the money.

1396
01:22:12,194 --> 01:22:14,942
Not an issue. Don't worry about it.

1397
01:22:15,427 --> 01:22:16,677
I'll sort it out in a week.

1398
01:22:17,092 --> 01:22:21,411
Let me know if you face any issues
in bringing back you husband's body...

1399
01:22:21,763 --> 01:22:22,755
I'll make the arrangements.

1400
01:22:23,170 --> 01:22:24,146
We can discuss
about the fees later.

1401
01:22:24,224 --> 01:22:27,786
Collector's office said marriage certificate
will speed up the process.

1402
01:22:27,904 --> 01:22:30,302
Collector's office
will always give you a hard time.

1403
01:22:30,733 --> 01:22:33,279
People who go abroad
to work from Ramanathapuram...

1404
01:22:33,582 --> 01:22:36,730
in the last decade
22,000 workers have died.

1405
01:22:36,959 --> 01:22:37,459
Sir?

1406
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:39,560
How many bodies do you think
they've claimed till date?

1407
01:22:39,834 --> 01:22:41,037
Sir, you're scaring me now.

1408
01:22:41,474 --> 01:22:42,997
Don't think I'm trying to scare you.

1409
01:22:43,271 --> 01:22:44,083
I'm telling you the truth.

1410
01:22:44,538 --> 01:22:47,436
But I don't think there's any issue.

1411
01:22:47,998 --> 01:22:49,193
As far as there are no issues,
I'm okay.

1412
01:22:49,310 --> 01:22:50,957
If there's anything else,
let me know.

1413
01:22:51,325 --> 01:22:52,129
I'll help you with it.

1414
01:22:52,946 --> 01:22:54,184
Sir, get this sorted as soon as possible.

1415
01:22:54,310 --> 01:22:56,391
It'll be done. Don't worry.

1416
01:23:22,471 --> 01:23:25,815
Sir, this is not Ranasingam.
This is not my friend, Ranasingam.

1417
01:23:25,947 --> 01:23:27,651
That's not him.

1418
01:23:49,554 --> 01:23:50,639
This is Mani from Dubai.

1419
01:23:50,688 --> 01:23:51,570
Tell me, Mani.

1420
01:23:51,781 --> 01:23:54,437
Ariyanachi, they won't dispatch
Ranasingam's body.

1421
01:23:54,648 --> 01:23:55,736
What are you saying?

1422
01:23:57,905 --> 01:24:01,385
Indian and Dubai officers took us
to the hospital.

1423
01:24:01,735 --> 01:24:03,016
They should someone else's corpse...

1424
01:24:03,081 --> 01:24:05,251
forced us to identify as Ranasingam's body.

1425
01:24:05,413 --> 01:24:06,687
-Accident?
-That's right.

1426
01:24:07,056 --> 01:24:09,758
But the company said he died in a riot.

1427
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:12,923
Riots! It's a lie.
There were no riots.

1428
01:24:13,275 --> 01:24:14,823
A huge accident occurred at
the oil plant.

1429
01:24:15,384 --> 01:24:19,964
In that accident 15 of Bangladeshis,
Pakistanis and Sri Lankans died.

1430
01:24:20,147 --> 01:24:23,032
Don't believe in lies told to you
by the company or the Govt.

1431
01:24:23,319 --> 01:24:25,038
They won't even look for your
husband's body.

1432
01:24:25,396 --> 01:24:26,409
Don't let them getaway with it.

1433
01:24:27,336 --> 01:24:30,203
Don't tell anyone that I gave you
this information.

1434
01:24:30,326 --> 01:24:31,703
They'll fire me from the job.

1435
01:24:32,201 --> 01:24:33,389
Hello! Hello!

1436
01:24:33,538 --> 01:24:35,874
I've informed her everything.
Don't let them getaway with it.

1437
01:24:36,224 --> 01:24:38,232
Don't believe anything the company
tells you.

1438
01:24:38,311 --> 01:24:39,873
Hello, hello, hello!

1439
01:24:42,185 --> 01:24:43,007
What happened, dear?

1440
01:24:45,178 --> 01:24:46,045
What happened?

1441
01:24:46,429 --> 01:24:46,960
What happened?

1442
01:24:49,147 --> 01:24:49,810
Brother...

1443
01:24:50,883 --> 01:24:53,690
He died in a factory accident...

1444
01:24:54,107 --> 01:24:58,628
but they lied to us saying,
he died during riots.

1445
01:24:59,656 --> 01:25:03,370
Buddy, you protested to bring change...

1446
01:25:03,975 --> 01:25:07,026
but now it's just reduced
to a wall without a voice.

1447
01:25:10,729 --> 01:25:13,721
Who informed that your brother
died in an accident at the Oil company?

1448
01:25:13,814 --> 01:25:16,759
He's my brother's friend who worked
with him at the plant.

1449
01:25:17,378 --> 01:25:18,542
Did he witness the accident?

1450
01:25:19,564 --> 01:25:20,243
Yes, sir.

1451
01:25:20,870 --> 01:25:21,721
That's what he said.

1452
01:25:21,900 --> 01:25:23,626
Is it possible to
talk to him over the phone?

1453
01:25:23,705 --> 01:25:24,704
If we confirm with him...

1454
01:25:24,823 --> 01:25:28,199
I'll check with our embassy in Dubai
and initiate an investigation.

1455
01:25:28,277 --> 01:25:30,738
Sir, he did mention one thing
when he spoke to us.

1456
01:25:30,862 --> 01:25:33,229
Not to bring up his name,
'cause he'll lose his job.

1457
01:25:33,386 --> 01:25:34,979
-For god sake, don't drag him--
-Listen...

1458
01:25:35,231 --> 01:25:39,463
in order for me to take an action,
I need a solid proof.

1459
01:25:39,598 --> 01:25:41,003
How do I get a proof...

1460
01:25:42,299 --> 01:25:43,673
Anything could've happened.

1461
01:25:44,688 --> 01:25:46,175
I'm not here to seek justice.

1462
01:25:46,471 --> 01:25:47,768
I'm here for my husband.

1463
01:25:48,284 --> 01:25:49,729
Sir, please for god sake,
help us in this matter.

1464
01:25:49,916 --> 01:25:51,963
We're here to help the public.

1465
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:53,260
Please be patient.

1466
01:25:53,361 --> 01:25:55,291
Sir, we're being pushed around
for past 5 months.

1467
01:25:55,667 --> 01:26:01,018
They say, just like how you ignored
the fishermen issue...

1468
01:26:01,266 --> 01:26:04,214
you'd do the same
with my brother's matter too.

1469
01:26:05,885 --> 01:26:07,072
Who's been spreading this nonsense?

1470
01:26:07,635 --> 01:26:09,979
I agree, there might've been
rare instances of that sort.

1471
01:26:10,386 --> 01:26:12,307
The hardship of fishermen...

1472
01:26:12,448 --> 01:26:13,745
or their issues with the boats,

1473
01:26:13,884 --> 01:26:15,401
people are oblivious in how they overcome
these issues.

1474
01:26:15,876 --> 01:26:17,899
How'd they know about
government's involvement in it?

1475
01:26:18,838 --> 01:26:19,814
Don't confuse yourself.

1476
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:23,252
Soon I'll come bearing good news.

1477
01:26:50,415 --> 01:26:51,064
Hello?

1478
01:26:52,056 --> 01:26:53,414
-Hello?
-Who's at the door?

1479
01:26:54,235 --> 01:26:56,392
I'm here to meet Agent Ameer bhai.

1480
01:26:56,728 --> 01:26:58,095
No one lives here by that name.

1481
01:27:14,442 --> 01:27:15,809
-Hey, woman...
-Stop right there.

1482
01:27:15,857 --> 01:27:17,669
-Who are you?
-Why are you here?

1483
01:27:17,731 --> 01:27:20,176
-I'm looking for Ameer bhai...
-Don't make excuses.

1484
01:27:20,301 --> 01:27:22,161
Were you trying to break in and steal?

1485
01:27:22,213 --> 01:27:24,581
No, I'm not. My husband
recently passed away.

1486
01:27:24,714 --> 01:27:26,049
So, you're using your
husband's death as an excuse...

1487
01:27:26,152 --> 01:27:27,590
to beg on the streets with our child.

1488
01:27:27,932 --> 01:27:30,106
If you have to beg,
then go to public places.

1489
01:27:30,169 --> 01:27:31,661
Beg-- I'm not here to beg

1490
01:27:31,686 --> 01:27:33,656
Shut up. If you don't leave,
I'll arrest you.

1491
01:27:33,854 --> 01:27:36,481
This is a residential area.
People like you shouldn't be here.

1492
01:27:36,661 --> 01:27:37,098
Get lost!

1493
01:27:37,314 --> 01:27:39,096
Already there are too many
complaints registered under your name.

1494
01:27:39,338 --> 01:27:39,908
Let's go!

1495
01:27:51,111 --> 01:27:51,909
I'll meet you later tonight.

1496
01:27:52,276 --> 01:27:53,291
Okay, brother.

1497
01:27:57,127 --> 01:27:58,298
Why are you sitting over here?

1498
01:27:58,393 --> 01:27:59,471
Are you waiting for someone?

1499
01:27:59,838 --> 01:28:01,173
I came looking for you, brother.

1500
01:28:01,464 --> 01:28:03,869
I called you,
but you never returned my calls.

1501
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:06,588
When I went to your office,
they said you never came to work.

1502
01:28:06,722 --> 01:28:08,261
That's why I'm here looking for you.

1503
01:28:08,512 --> 01:28:09,746
Mayapaandi, informed me.

1504
01:28:09,933 --> 01:28:12,683
I was caught up with work,
that's why I couldn't return calls.

1505
01:28:12,947 --> 01:28:16,704
Brother, my husband's colleague say
it was an accident.

1506
01:28:16,945 --> 01:28:19,382
Whereas, the Govt. offices are stating
another reason.

1507
01:28:19,829 --> 01:28:21,211
What exactly is the truth?

1508
01:28:22,124 --> 01:28:24,810
It is said, "A giving devil is better than
a non-giving God."

1509
01:28:25,196 --> 01:28:27,172
I have to speak to the officials
of that company.

1510
01:28:27,391 --> 01:28:28,945
That's why I came looking for you.

1511
01:28:29,211 --> 01:28:30,844
For god sake,
please tell me the truth.

1512
01:28:34,969 --> 01:28:36,281
I just finished my prayers.

1513
01:28:38,618 --> 01:28:41,688
If I lie, Allah won't spare me.

1514
01:28:42,048 --> 01:28:44,517
Please come, don't stand with a kid
under this scorching sun.

1515
01:28:47,016 --> 01:28:47,648
Please come.

1516
01:28:57,146 --> 01:28:57,903
God willing.

1517
01:29:01,115 --> 01:29:02,677
Your husband didn't die in a protest.

1518
01:29:03,552 --> 01:29:04,966
He indeed died in an accident.

1519
01:29:07,684 --> 01:29:10,966
But no one seemed to tell the truth.

1520
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:16,370
I entrusted you before sending him abroad.

1521
01:29:16,811 --> 01:29:18,646
Where else do you expect me
to seek the truth?

1522
01:29:18,944 --> 01:29:22,623
I have to answer to bosses above me.

1523
01:29:22,974 --> 01:29:25,182
It's easy to crack the way of politicians.

1524
01:29:25,678 --> 01:29:28,200
But it's hard to crack the businessmen.

1525
01:29:28,514 --> 01:29:29,724
They'll make sure you don't.

1526
01:29:30,193 --> 01:29:33,819
They may be in Dubai,
but they surely pull my strings over here.

1527
01:29:34,764 --> 01:29:36,115
That's the power of corporate.

1528
01:29:36,889 --> 01:29:40,897
I'm just an employee.
Don't expect more from me.

1529
01:29:41,850 --> 01:29:44,959
If I have to continue doing my job...

1530
01:29:45,616 --> 01:29:46,639
I can't seek truth.

1531
01:29:47,631 --> 01:29:48,506
I'll advise the same to you.

1532
01:29:48,967 --> 01:29:51,826
Let's try to bring back Ranasingam's body.

1533
01:29:52,460 --> 01:29:53,717
The almighty will take care of the rest.

1534
01:29:54,514 --> 01:29:55,240
But one thing...

1535
01:29:56,070 --> 01:29:59,062
only you have the strength
to bring him back.

1536
01:30:16,902 --> 01:30:18,000
Honey, don't you have any sense?

1537
01:30:18,653 --> 01:30:21,598
I've told you a million times,
that I can't be without you.

1538
01:30:23,614 --> 01:30:24,832
You left your family behind...

1539
01:30:25,428 --> 01:30:29,281
did you ever think or
cared about your wife?

1540
01:30:31,522 --> 01:30:32,139
What do you want?

1541
01:30:33,085 --> 01:30:34,983
She's been cooped up since morning.

1542
01:30:35,368 --> 01:30:37,055
She's been starving since morning.

1543
01:30:37,414 --> 01:30:39,038
I want to serve her food.
Let me give it to her.

1544
01:30:39,172 --> 01:30:41,367
She's fast asleep.
You please leave from here.

1545
01:30:41,850 --> 01:30:43,006
Let me just check on her.

1546
01:30:43,256 --> 01:30:44,186
I said, please leave.

1547
01:30:44,492 --> 01:30:45,889
I'll take care of her.
You please leave.

1548
01:30:51,608 --> 01:30:54,600
-Listen, Ariyanachi...
-Honey, don't talk to me.

1549
01:30:55,210 --> 01:30:56,139
So, shall I leave?

1550
01:30:57,015 --> 01:30:58,460
Come on, tell me. Shall I leave?

1551
01:31:00,883 --> 01:31:01,391
Honey...

1552
01:31:03,454 --> 01:31:04,344
don't leave.

1553
01:31:05,123 --> 01:31:07,953
Please hear me out.
Don't leave me.

1554
01:31:09,116 --> 01:31:09,773
Stay right here.

1555
01:31:12,362 --> 01:31:13,758
Hurry up, it seems he's heading
for a meeting.

1556
01:31:13,883 --> 01:31:14,399
Okay Brother.

1557
01:31:15,189 --> 01:31:16,946
Tell me, Mr.Councilor.

1558
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:20,415
Usually you don't turn up,
but how come you're here today?

1559
01:31:20,656 --> 01:31:22,282
Seems like you're aspiring to become MLA.

1560
01:31:22,706 --> 01:31:24,182
I heard you paid a visit to the minister.

1561
01:31:24,308 --> 01:31:25,526
Brother, you've misunderstood.

1562
01:31:25,761 --> 01:31:27,721
You're a political wizard.

1563
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:28,526
How can I contest against you.

1564
01:31:28,635 --> 01:31:31,064
You'll be the permanent MLA
of this constituency.

1565
01:31:31,276 --> 01:31:33,393
People are trying to pit us
against each other.

1566
01:31:34,353 --> 01:31:37,838
Don't try to sass me with your antics.

1567
01:31:38,424 --> 01:31:39,868
There's nothing permanent.

1568
01:31:40,050 --> 01:31:41,299
And he's talking about permanent MLA.

1569
01:31:42,884 --> 01:31:43,656
Get to the point.

1570
01:31:44,072 --> 01:31:46,025
Brother, I spoke about it last week.

1571
01:31:46,830 --> 01:31:48,103
She's my sister, Ariyanachi.

1572
01:31:48,331 --> 01:31:50,992
She's my nephew Ranasingam's wife.

1573
01:31:51,134 --> 01:31:53,783
-Oh, the Dubai matter.
-Yes.

1574
01:31:54,329 --> 01:31:55,954
Ranasingam is family...

1575
01:31:56,111 --> 01:31:58,197
he always stands up for the people.

1576
01:31:58,394 --> 01:32:00,391
If not for Ranasingam,
he couldn't have become councilor.

1577
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:04,556
He's boasting as if he was
rightfully elected by the people.

1578
01:32:04,690 --> 01:32:07,284
-Don't you agree?
-You're absolutely right.

1579
01:32:07,635 --> 01:32:08,837
You don't worry.

1580
01:32:08,956 --> 01:32:10,252
I'll be going to Madras
in couple of days...

1581
01:32:10,432 --> 01:32:11,556
I'll speak to the minister.

1582
01:32:11,720 --> 01:32:13,846
If possible,
I'll meet the Chief Minister too.

1583
01:32:13,970 --> 01:32:14,610
Sounds great.

1584
01:32:14,995 --> 01:32:16,151
Thanks a lot, brother.

1585
01:32:16,456 --> 01:32:17,041
Come on, let's leave.

1586
01:32:17,268 --> 01:32:18,081
-Sure, bye.
-Thank you.

1587
01:32:18,370 --> 01:32:19,455
-Hey, Councilor!
-Tell me, brother.

1588
01:32:20,487 --> 01:32:22,680
-Ariyanachi, please wait outside.
-Okay, brother.

1589
01:32:22,752 --> 01:32:23,127
Go!

1590
01:32:23,759 --> 01:32:25,447
Tomorrow, we're protesting
at Mudilathoor for water...

1591
01:32:25,752 --> 01:32:26,595
bring her along.

1592
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:29,525
Brother, she's still mourning
her husband's death.

1593
01:32:30,072 --> 01:32:33,955
She's been struggling to bring back
her husband's dead body from Dubai.

1594
01:32:34,259 --> 01:32:35,727
Attending a protest will be difficult.

1595
01:32:35,877 --> 01:32:37,502
I know what I am doing.

1596
01:32:38,062 --> 01:32:40,751
If people see her with the kid
at the protest...

1597
01:32:40,938 --> 01:32:43,446
the news will go viral on social media.

1598
01:32:43,774 --> 01:32:45,181
That's how we can solve this matter.

1599
01:32:45,415 --> 01:32:47,118
Don't you think I care about my people?

1600
01:32:47,462 --> 01:32:48,898
Just do as I said.

1601
01:32:49,485 --> 01:32:50,134
Okay, brother.

1602
01:32:58,298 --> 01:32:59,539
Ariyanachi Ranasingam.

1603
01:33:01,104 --> 01:33:02,338
Hey, Ka.Pae.Ranasingam.

1604
01:33:03,791 --> 01:33:05,564
I'm feel lost with you, dear.

1605
01:33:08,010 --> 01:33:09,291
I'm not strong as before.

1606
01:33:13,065 --> 01:33:16,888
Agreed that you're alone and scared...

1607
01:33:17,653 --> 01:33:19,282
courage was your forte.

1608
01:33:19,888 --> 01:33:21,662
The word fear meant nothing to you.

1609
01:33:22,621 --> 01:33:23,769
You expect me to believe,
that you're scared?

1610
01:33:24,918 --> 01:33:25,911
I'm well aware of my wife's traits...

1611
01:33:27,615 --> 01:33:30,783
she's an embodiment of powerful goddesses.

1612
01:33:32,888 --> 01:33:34,353
Her name is Ariyanachi.

1613
01:33:35,599 --> 01:33:40,138
My love for Ariyanachi is unconditional.

1614
01:33:41,647 --> 01:33:44,467
I'm the lucky one
who get to spend my life with her.

1615
01:33:48,069 --> 01:33:49,768
If you don't believe me...

1616
01:33:51,630 --> 01:33:54,412
then take a look at yourself
in the mirror.

1617
01:33:55,762 --> 01:33:58,470
Today, you shouldn't leave midway
during our conversation.

1618
01:33:59,416 --> 01:34:00,025
Sister-in-law.

1619
01:34:02,805 --> 01:34:05,765
You must think I've gone crazy,
talking to myself.

1620
01:34:05,846 --> 01:34:07,127
No, I didn't mean to.

1621
01:34:07,284 --> 01:34:08,361
You don't have to pretend.

1622
01:34:09,363 --> 01:34:12,006
I knew, you were at my door
last night.

1623
01:34:12,994 --> 01:34:15,049
And you lied about me
to mother-in-law.

1624
01:34:15,620 --> 01:34:16,752
I know everything.

1625
01:34:17,470 --> 01:34:19,259
People may think I've gone crazy.

1626
01:34:20,439 --> 01:34:23,869
But, speaking to my dead husband...

1627
01:34:24,869 --> 01:34:25,618
gives me peace.

1628
01:34:28,869 --> 01:34:31,923
Mayi, bring me your brother's shirt.

1629
01:34:34,545 --> 01:34:35,714
That's not happening.

1630
01:34:36,283 --> 01:34:38,431
Don't underestimate the power of a MLA.

1631
01:34:38,603 --> 01:34:42,173
I've spent 400 rupees per vote.

1632
01:34:42,362 --> 01:34:45,127
You guys favor
Chief Minister and Central Minister.

1633
01:34:45,282 --> 01:34:46,908
But you turn a deaf ear to me.

1634
01:34:47,901 --> 01:34:51,047
I'm the Chief minister of this village.

1635
01:34:51,148 --> 01:34:53,443
I'll make sure you can't
generate electricity from this village.

1636
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:54,483
-Sir, hear me out...
-Hang up, damn it.

1637
01:34:55,829 --> 01:34:59,297
My beloved patrons of the village.

1638
01:34:59,665 --> 01:35:04,071
I welcome you all to this protest.

1639
01:35:04,859 --> 01:35:07,968
This protest will go down the history.

1640
01:35:08,102 --> 01:35:09,540
That's awesome!

1641
01:35:10,540 --> 01:35:12,712
When your came down
with the Electricity company proposition...

1642
01:35:13,031 --> 01:35:14,991
you promised to provide jobs
for the village folks.

1643
01:35:15,290 --> 01:35:17,242
Initially you pretended to employ them...

1644
01:35:17,493 --> 01:35:20,211
now you've fired them
and have employed North Indians.

1645
01:35:20,484 --> 01:35:22,829
I'm not going to sit idle
bear this atrocity.

1646
01:35:23,249 --> 01:35:24,054
I won't let this matter slide.

1647
01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:26,810
Hail, Chief!

1648
01:35:27,109 --> 01:35:28,430
This goes to the Central Government too.

1649
01:35:28,579 --> 01:35:29,805
Agree that you're
incapable of providing water.

1650
01:35:29,851 --> 01:35:32,312
I'll provide water to my people
from Ganga river at my expense.

1651
01:35:33,460 --> 01:35:34,962
You're incapable of providing water.

1652
01:35:35,580 --> 01:35:38,267
This woman has been widowed recently...

1653
01:35:38,382 --> 01:35:40,156
are you capable of resolving her issues?

1654
01:35:40,391 --> 01:35:41,171
Come on, tell me.

1655
01:35:41,759 --> 01:35:43,016
It's injustice.

1656
01:35:43,102 --> 01:35:44,977
Who should I hold responsible for her loss?

1657
01:35:45,304 --> 01:35:47,257
Central Government has deceived
the Tamizh people.

1658
01:35:50,813 --> 01:35:53,623
The food I've arranged
for the women folk is ready.

1659
01:35:54,013 --> 01:35:55,476
They'll return after their meal.

1660
01:35:55,563 --> 01:35:57,257
Ariyanachi. Listen, Ariyanachi.

1661
01:35:58,038 --> 01:35:59,170
Why are you leaving?

1662
01:35:59,632 --> 01:36:01,865
Brother, he's using me as a prop
for his greed.

1663
01:36:01,969 --> 01:36:03,625
Do you expect me
to pose for the pictures?

1664
01:36:03,796 --> 01:36:06,522
He's capable of convincing the minister--

1665
01:36:06,633 --> 01:36:11,407
I've seen Ranasingam protest
and I have been a part of it too.

1666
01:36:11,516 --> 01:36:13,141
Half the crowd followed once you left.

1667
01:36:13,727 --> 01:36:15,828
Brother, this crowd is not meant for me.

1668
01:36:16,212 --> 01:36:17,633
They came in to support Ranasingam.

1669
01:36:17,931 --> 01:36:19,345
I came, just 'cause you asked me to.

1670
01:36:19,694 --> 01:36:21,584
I never expected him to resolve my issue.

1671
01:36:27,031 --> 01:36:29,820
Dear. Ariyanachi, what happened?

1672
01:36:32,608 --> 01:36:33,302
Oh, god!

1673
01:37:09,196 --> 01:37:09,852
Honey!

1674
01:37:11,875 --> 01:37:13,742
-Honey...
-What's it, dear?

1675
01:37:14,586 --> 01:37:15,750
My sweetheart.

1676
01:37:17,187 --> 01:37:18,976
Remember what your brother
mentioned earlier?

1677
01:37:19,219 --> 01:37:19,672
What?

1678
01:37:22,321 --> 01:37:23,555
First, hear me out.

1679
01:37:23,990 --> 01:37:27,093
I can't focus,
when a pretty woman is beside me.

1680
01:37:27,171 --> 01:37:27,866
Tell me.

1681
01:37:28,250 --> 01:37:29,914
It's been two months
since we got married.

1682
01:37:31,061 --> 01:37:33,687
Two months?
Isn't three months the right time?

1683
01:37:33,929 --> 01:37:34,820
Nothing happened between us
before the marriage.

1684
01:37:34,849 --> 01:37:37,045
-How's it possible--
-Ranasingam, shut up.

1685
01:37:37,749 --> 01:37:39,290
All you do is talk...

1686
01:37:39,438 --> 01:37:41,563
can't you hear me out?

1687
01:37:47,054 --> 01:37:48,835
You're totally oblivious to
what's happening in the family.

1688
01:37:49,298 --> 01:37:50,368
Has anyone spoke to you?

1689
01:37:52,024 --> 01:37:52,782
Thought as much.

1690
01:37:53,469 --> 01:37:56,336
Your parents are proud,
'cause you stand up for the people.

1691
01:37:56,899 --> 01:38:00,978
You've impressed your family
just as the people of this village.

1692
01:38:02,782 --> 01:38:03,844
Hey, speak up, damn it.

1693
01:38:05,107 --> 01:38:07,311
When I speak you shut me off,
and when I don't you want me to speak.

1694
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:08,813
What do you want from me?

1695
01:38:09,231 --> 01:38:11,293
Why are you beating around the bush?

1696
01:38:11,763 --> 01:38:12,872
Get to the point.

1697
01:38:14,957 --> 01:38:18,376
Look, you hold a diploma
in Chemical Engineering.

1698
01:38:18,654 --> 01:38:20,208
That too you passed out
with distinction.

1699
01:38:20,693 --> 01:38:21,693
You can put that to use...

1700
01:38:22,410 --> 01:38:24,583
and apply for a job
at the Electricity company.

1701
01:38:26,622 --> 01:38:27,872
If that doesn't work for you...

1702
01:38:28,441 --> 01:38:32,258
like your brother suggested,
try seeking a job abroad.

1703
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:39,192
What is it now?

1704
01:38:40,451 --> 01:38:41,501
I'm thinking hard.

1705
01:38:47,915 --> 01:38:49,887
-We'll discuss later.
-Let go of me.

1706
01:38:51,102 --> 01:38:53,376
In this scorching heat...

1707
01:38:54,075 --> 01:38:55,322
ninety eight men are waiting in the line.

1708
01:38:56,763 --> 01:38:57,970
He's not going to listen to me.

1709
01:39:00,322 --> 01:39:03,556
Buddy, unlike you
I'm not cut out for hard work.

1710
01:39:03,681 --> 01:39:04,791
It won't suit me.

1711
01:39:05,236 --> 01:39:05,736
Why?

1712
01:39:05,907 --> 01:39:09,970
It's 'cause standing in long queues...

1713
01:39:10,072 --> 01:39:12,236
is the job of common people.

1714
01:39:12,478 --> 01:39:15,556
Politicians like me should
contest in elections and win.

1715
01:39:15,642 --> 01:39:17,806
Later, people will queue up to meet me.

1716
01:39:17,875 --> 01:39:18,845
What kind of logic is this?

1717
01:39:19,655 --> 01:39:22,192
Hardworking class like you
won't understand.

1718
01:39:22,436 --> 01:39:23,436
Shall I take a leave.

1719
01:39:25,367 --> 01:39:28,101
Folks, vote for me and make me
a councilor, soon.

1720
01:39:28,437 --> 01:39:29,790
Please stand in a straight line.

1721
01:39:51,219 --> 01:39:52,874
Hey, what is it? What happened?

1722
01:39:54,725 --> 01:39:55,780
You stay right there. Don't move.

1723
01:40:00,029 --> 01:40:01,525
Ranasingam, what are you doing?

1724
01:40:10,039 --> 01:40:10,835
Move aside. Come on, move.

1725
01:40:10,998 --> 01:40:11,881
Hey, move!

1726
01:40:11,978 --> 01:40:12,869
Hey, move aside!

1727
01:40:13,390 --> 01:40:15,702
-What the hell are you doing?
-Please move aside.

1728
01:40:16,367 --> 01:40:17,593
Damn it, can't you hear me?

1729
01:40:22,438 --> 01:40:23,437
What are you doing?

1730
01:40:24,235 --> 01:40:26,101
Sir, there's water stream running under.

1731
01:40:26,431 --> 01:40:27,454
Are you an astrologer?

1732
01:40:27,517 --> 01:40:28,954
We're a family of stream finders.

1733
01:40:29,024 --> 01:40:30,102
Then go and mind that business.

1734
01:40:30,203 --> 01:40:31,500
Sir, this is an exclusion land.
How did you get it registered?

1735
01:40:31,571 --> 01:40:32,743
Hey, mind your business.

1736
01:40:33,509 --> 01:40:34,829
Where's your superior officer?

1737
01:40:34,890 --> 01:40:36,306
Hey, can't you hear me?
Get lost from here.

1738
01:40:36,367 --> 01:40:37,126
Sir, sir, sir...

1739
01:40:37,212 --> 01:40:38,126
-Hey, get lost.
-Get lost!

1740
01:40:39,022 --> 01:40:40,437
-Sir... Sir...
-Hey, who are you man?

1741
01:40:40,650 --> 01:40:41,829
-I'm here for a job.
-Do you work here?

1742
01:40:42,106 --> 01:40:43,375
I'm here to apply for a job.

1743
01:40:43,665 --> 01:40:44,430
I was standing in the line.

1744
01:40:44,798 --> 01:40:47,071
I realized that the stream
is running strong under this land.

1745
01:40:47,165 --> 01:40:48,563
-Oh, really?
-The force is strong.

1746
01:40:48,611 --> 01:40:49,586
-There are many villages around.
-Hey...

1747
01:40:49,649 --> 01:40:51,118
stop staring and throw him out.

1748
01:40:51,235 --> 01:40:52,243
-Sir.
-Get lost!

1749
01:40:52,461 --> 01:40:53,360
-Sir!
-Get lost!

1750
01:40:53,493 --> 01:40:54,048
Sir, please hear me out.

1751
01:40:54,073 --> 01:40:55,608
It's a matter of many villages...

1752
01:40:55,633 --> 01:40:56,637
please hear me out.

1753
01:40:56,837 --> 01:40:58,633
It's not fair, sir. Please hear me out.

1754
01:40:58,790 --> 01:40:59,947
-Sir! Sir!
-Kick him out of here.

1755
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:17,540
Hey!

1756
01:42:28,673 --> 01:42:29,930
It was a huge issue.

1757
01:42:30,016 --> 01:42:32,610
But no one came forward to inquire
what happened to you.

1758
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:35,195
It's really hard to make him understand.

1759
01:42:35,609 --> 01:42:36,509
Please calm down.

1760
01:42:36,977 --> 01:42:38,781
Do I sound bitter to you?

1761
01:42:39,048 --> 01:42:40,626
Tell you what,
it's sweet, keep talking.

1762
01:42:40,789 --> 01:42:42,657
-It will help me heal, keep talking.
-Ranasingam!

1763
01:42:42,891 --> 01:42:44,796
Stop arguing with her.

1764
01:42:45,179 --> 01:42:47,819
First thing in the morning,
we'll make sure everyone knows about it.

1765
01:42:47,938 --> 01:42:50,273
What do you suggest?
Our people were vulnerable...

1766
01:42:50,352 --> 01:42:53,172
that company used it to their advantage
and bought the lands.

1767
01:42:53,335 --> 01:42:55,187
We're not alone to suffer
without the water...

1768
01:42:55,429 --> 01:42:56,859
everyone are sailing in the same boat.

1769
01:42:57,139 --> 01:43:02,123
Uncle, if we sit ducks,
we're the bigger fools.

1770
01:43:02,586 --> 01:43:04,453
Their kids will face the wrath one day too.

1771
01:43:05,161 --> 01:43:07,998
No one gives a damn, but you.

1772
01:43:08,536 --> 01:43:09,812
Why shouldn't I give a damn?

1773
01:43:10,632 --> 01:43:11,863
Our roots are right over here.

1774
01:43:12,380 --> 01:43:14,437
Dad, we've been living here
for generations, right?

1775
01:43:14,949 --> 01:43:15,992
This place is our haven.

1776
01:43:18,959 --> 01:43:23,062
They assumed these lands are parched
and sold it for pennies.

1777
01:43:23,592 --> 01:43:24,716
But now there's water.

1778
01:43:25,014 --> 01:43:26,014
Not just a midge.

1779
01:43:26,364 --> 01:43:30,234
That electricity company is using one lac
liters/day of water just to wash plates.

1780
01:43:30,778 --> 01:43:32,090
How do you expect me sit idle?

1781
01:43:32,605 --> 01:43:36,766
Weren't you worried about
our family's future?

1782
01:43:36,872 --> 01:43:39,020
Do you think your children's future
lies in America?

1783
01:43:39,505 --> 01:43:41,624
They'll shoot you at sight,
'cause of your skin tone.

1784
01:43:41,857 --> 01:43:42,789
You have no idea.

1785
01:43:44,322 --> 01:43:46,304
Son, I totally agree with you...

1786
01:43:46,408 --> 01:43:49,235
it's really scary to venture
into agriculture at the moment.

1787
01:43:49,423 --> 01:43:51,555
I'm getting older by the day.

1788
01:43:51,774 --> 01:43:53,476
I just have one daughter.

1789
01:43:53,656 --> 01:43:56,031
If I get her married,
I'm done with responsibilities.

1790
01:43:56,227 --> 01:43:58,868
Beyond this,
I have no use for agriculture.

1791
01:44:00,235 --> 01:44:01,967
Hunger is the deadliest disease
in the world.

1792
01:44:02,275 --> 01:44:04,040
Politics take full advantage of it.

1793
01:44:05,032 --> 01:44:07,358
No one desires to work abroad.

1794
01:44:08,148 --> 01:44:10,880
Everyone wishes to stay next to their family
and live a peaceful life.

1795
01:44:12,170 --> 01:44:14,327
It's not wrong to protest
or fight for the people.

1796
01:44:15,477 --> 01:44:17,067
But that'll starve my family.

1797
01:44:18,250 --> 01:44:20,937
This power plant did bring
some peace in our lives.

1798
01:44:21,024 --> 01:44:22,273
And there's a little hope.

1799
01:44:23,173 --> 01:44:26,844
Indulging in protests and
going against the government...

1800
01:44:28,023 --> 01:44:29,531
I'll lose the only job
I have at the moment.

1801
01:44:31,125 --> 01:44:31,828
Protest?

1802
01:44:32,157 --> 01:44:34,063
Who is it against?
What is the purpose?

1803
01:44:34,907 --> 01:44:38,476
It's people's rule. And people are
at peace under our governance.

1804
01:44:38,578 --> 01:44:40,484
-Aren't you aware of it?
-I'm well aware.

1805
01:44:40,595 --> 01:44:42,086
What Ranasingam has to say is...

1806
01:44:42,250 --> 01:44:45,139
that two acres land
was an unauthorized land.

1807
01:44:45,288 --> 01:44:46,210
It is indeed.

1808
01:44:46,399 --> 01:44:48,901
Government can't create
job opportunities using it.

1809
01:44:49,095 --> 01:44:51,970
I'm sure you're aware how many
are unemployed in our village.

1810
01:44:52,281 --> 01:44:53,429
This scheme is introduced for them.

1811
01:44:53,632 --> 01:44:54,530
Think hard.

1812
01:44:54,813 --> 01:44:56,195
Do you think,
either you or me can employ 2000 people?

1813
01:44:56,326 --> 01:44:57,329
That's highly impossible.

1814
01:44:57,868 --> 01:45:00,805
Sir, your logic doesn't make any sense.

1815
01:45:02,944 --> 01:45:04,455
Employing 2000 people...

1816
01:45:04,540 --> 01:45:07,035
and leaving 50,000 farmers
stranded without resources is not viable.

1817
01:45:08,170 --> 01:45:10,369
Look, I get your point.

1818
01:45:11,683 --> 01:45:13,039
I'm the MLA of this village.

1819
01:45:13,453 --> 01:45:15,968
I'm well aware.
This is not just my decision.

1820
01:45:16,188 --> 01:45:21,646
There are many ministers and MP's
above me who makes this decision.

1821
01:45:21,827 --> 01:45:25,070
They're surrounded with
well-educated Civil service officers.

1822
01:45:25,226 --> 01:45:27,819
I believe we're not wiser than them.

1823
01:45:28,437 --> 01:45:31,369
Sir, doesn't matter who it is,
only water can quench the thirst.

1824
01:45:31,758 --> 01:45:33,027
If not, they'll die of hiccups.

1825
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:36,173
Until the hunger exists
as a disease in this world...

1826
01:45:36,555 --> 01:45:38,816
agriculture will be
the highest form of business.

1827
01:45:39,346 --> 01:45:39,859
That's why, sir--

1828
01:45:42,886 --> 01:45:44,803
Awesome! It sounds great.

1829
01:45:44,937 --> 01:45:46,901
-It sounds great.
-Yes, he's good with words.

1830
01:45:47,117 --> 01:45:48,515
I'll discuss about this.

1831
01:45:50,343 --> 01:45:51,999
Protesting won't fetch us water right away.

1832
01:45:52,102 --> 01:45:53,500
Nor it will solve our problems.

1833
01:45:53,569 --> 01:45:56,630
-Stop with your nonsense.
-Shut up, sister.

1834
01:45:56,803 --> 01:45:58,631
-Mind your own business.
-Get lost!

1835
01:45:58,804 --> 01:45:59,733
She's incorrigible.

1836
01:46:00,233 --> 01:46:03,436
Ranasingam, you've been helping
the people to save this land...

1837
01:46:03,609 --> 01:46:04,936
but that has got you nowhere.

1838
01:46:05,139 --> 01:46:08,399
But the middle men in the process
made tons of money.

1839
01:46:08,749 --> 01:46:10,217
You were left high and dry, my dear.

1840
01:46:10,482 --> 01:46:12,544
You're married now.

1841
01:46:12,716 --> 01:46:15,118
Take good care of her
and lead a happy life.

1842
01:46:24,100 --> 01:46:25,077
He's over there.

1843
01:46:28,881 --> 01:46:31,193
Ranasingam, we've been looking for you
everywhere.

1844
01:46:31,342 --> 01:46:33,709
-Why are you sitting alone over here?
-What happened, honey?

1845
01:46:34,633 --> 01:46:35,242
Nothing!

1846
01:46:36,749 --> 01:46:39,593
You beat up ten men of their company.

1847
01:46:40,037 --> 01:46:42,679
They'll retaliate with hundred men
to hurt you.

1848
01:46:43,031 --> 01:46:45,835
If not, they'll take legal action
and the police will arrest you.

1849
01:46:46,350 --> 01:46:48,616
Listen, earlier,
when you used to stage a protest...

1850
01:46:48,812 --> 01:46:52,368
the FIR used to be filed under
huge group of people, including your name.

1851
01:46:52,700 --> 01:46:56,161
But this time,
only your name is filed in FIR.

1852
01:46:57,147 --> 01:47:00,397
The company you're up against
has power and money.

1853
01:47:00,749 --> 01:47:03,712
Sadly, the people who used to support
are not with you anymore.

1854
01:47:03,952 --> 01:47:05,952
So, tell me,
what is the purpose of your protest?

1855
01:47:06,395 --> 01:47:08,227
Ranasingam, I have more experience.

1856
01:47:08,382 --> 01:47:09,796
I'm advising you as a brother.

1857
01:47:09,992 --> 01:47:12,671
No matter what,
only our family will be there for us.

1858
01:47:13,154 --> 01:47:14,616
Look at your poor wife.

1859
01:47:15,257 --> 01:47:16,921
She was sick worried looking for you.

1860
01:47:18,990 --> 01:47:21,935
Dear, please make him understand
and take him home.

1861
01:47:23,318 --> 01:47:24,787
-I'll take a leave.
-Go safe!

1862
01:47:28,428 --> 01:47:30,951
-Honey, let's go home.
-You carry on. I'll come later.

1863
01:47:34,537 --> 01:47:35,646
You carry on. I'll come later.

1864
01:47:36,311 --> 01:47:37,709
What are you going to do,
alone out here?

1865
01:47:38,476 --> 01:47:40,718
Why are you so angry with your family?

1866
01:47:46,989 --> 01:47:48,324
I'm angry on myself.

1867
01:47:50,901 --> 01:47:52,714
Whenever I've asked people
to join a protest...

1868
01:47:53,556 --> 01:47:54,690
they always followed me.

1869
01:47:58,306 --> 01:47:59,769
Not sure what happened this time.

1870
01:48:03,308 --> 01:48:05,152
May be they didn't understand
the purpose.

1871
01:48:06,244 --> 01:48:08,344
I should've explained it better.

1872
01:48:12,192 --> 01:48:13,138
Look here, honey.

1873
01:48:14,497 --> 01:48:17,801
Since morning you met a lot of people.

1874
01:48:18,442 --> 01:48:19,512
But no one came forward.

1875
01:48:20,723 --> 01:48:23,551
I'm sure they won't even remember
you paid a visit.

1876
01:48:24,746 --> 01:48:26,824
Even the ocean might recede at times.

1877
01:48:27,629 --> 01:48:29,778
But the problem with this village
will never end.

1878
01:48:30,817 --> 01:48:32,309
They keep piling up.

1879
01:48:34,013 --> 01:48:37,019
You slogged, protested and
brought canal and ponds to this village.

1880
01:48:37,950 --> 01:48:42,363
For ages to come,
your name will go down in history.

1881
01:48:43,434 --> 01:48:44,911
I believe that's a pride to preserve.

1882
01:48:46,230 --> 01:48:47,566
Just like uncle stated...

1883
01:48:48,428 --> 01:48:49,966
doesn't matter if it's one or two years,

1884
01:48:50,606 --> 01:48:52,324
go to abroad and make money.

1885
01:48:53,443 --> 01:48:56,786
Just for a few years.
Then you can do things at your will.

1886
01:48:57,247 --> 01:48:58,668
I always want you beside me.

1887
01:48:59,668 --> 01:49:00,574
Okay, dear?

1888
01:49:19,947 --> 01:49:22,572
The coverage accident plan agreed by us...

1889
01:49:22,931 --> 01:49:24,733
it comes around two hundred crores.

1890
01:49:24,938 --> 01:49:26,898
You're aware. How can you fix this?

1891
01:49:28,555 --> 01:49:32,274
Even if you agree on a lesser amount,
we're not going to accept it.

1892
01:49:32,634 --> 01:49:35,281
First thing, we've failed the
safety accountability.

1893
01:49:35,478 --> 01:49:37,227
It's going to cost us ten times
the insurance amount.

1894
01:49:37,305 --> 01:49:38,499
It's not a big deal.

1895
01:49:38,724 --> 01:49:40,505
If all the agents get abroad...

1896
01:49:40,624 --> 01:49:43,413
it will totally destroy our reputation.

1897
01:49:43,546 --> 01:49:45,514
They won't arrange cheap labor anymore.

1898
01:49:45,742 --> 01:49:46,929
Especially India.

1899
01:49:47,163 --> 01:49:50,037
Bangaladesh, Srilanka, Africa, Afghanistan

1900
01:49:50,334 --> 01:49:52,772
It will become more difficult to
get cheap labor.

1901
01:49:52,937 --> 01:49:54,006
Hold on. Hold on.

1902
01:49:54,711 --> 01:49:56,298
If you people keep discussing about
your issues.

1903
01:49:56,974 --> 01:49:59,235
What do I say to External Affairs
and my Government?

1904
01:49:59,948 --> 01:50:01,888
I've been asked by the Dubai Govt. to
discuss with you...

1905
01:50:01,913 --> 01:50:02,899
and arrive at a decision.

1906
01:50:03,233 --> 01:50:05,250
You should decide and help us.

1907
01:50:05,717 --> 01:50:07,381
Otherwise, it will be a big problem.

1908
01:50:07,750 --> 01:50:10,257
Because it involves two countries
international laws...

1909
01:50:10,687 --> 01:50:12,991
I directly forward it to you.

1910
01:50:13,498 --> 01:50:16,654
And that's too late. We have to present
someone at the court.

1911
01:50:16,827 --> 01:50:19,389
The case has been filed by the company...

1912
01:50:19,499 --> 01:50:23,532
and it states that the accident happened
outside the company's campus.

1913
01:50:27,868 --> 01:50:29,774
There are five lakh Indians
in the Middle-East.

1914
01:50:30,024 --> 01:50:33,165
If you force our hand,
then we'll have to pressure the Dubai Govt.

1915
01:50:33,939 --> 01:50:36,040
Then five lakh people will have to return
to their countries.

1916
01:50:36,702 --> 01:50:39,295
If our people leave your country,
who will work you, then?

1917
01:50:40,662 --> 01:50:43,584
You think you'll hire Americans?
Do you think, they'll work you.

1918
01:50:43,685 --> 01:50:46,430
It's not a big deal to make a settlement,

1919
01:50:46,622 --> 01:50:48,809
reputation or to pay a penalty.

1920
01:50:49,076 --> 01:50:50,076
-But--
-Wait!

1921
01:50:50,952 --> 01:50:52,561
If your American company is shut down...

1922
01:50:52,842 --> 01:50:56,225
Russia, China, and Israel are ready to
take over the oil wells.

1923
01:50:57,530 --> 01:50:59,147
It's enough they know about the accident.

1924
01:50:59,425 --> 01:51:00,160
They'll take over.

1925
01:51:01,608 --> 01:51:03,249
Many people from my country have
lost their lives here.

1926
01:51:03,592 --> 01:51:04,927
We're not digging out all the graves.

1927
01:51:05,593 --> 01:51:06,796
Job opportunities are less in our country.

1928
01:51:07,249 --> 01:51:09,647
You're providing job opportunity.
That's why this adjustment.

1929
01:51:09,974 --> 01:51:11,593
We can solve all the problems.

1930
01:51:11,901 --> 01:51:12,938
We need sometime.

1931
01:51:13,151 --> 01:51:15,384
Time? Time for what?

1932
01:51:15,518 --> 01:51:19,736
It'll be helpful, if you agree for the
final cremation to happen here.

1933
01:51:20,220 --> 01:51:20,633
Oh!

1934
01:51:21,550 --> 01:51:22,081
Okay.

1935
01:51:23,228 --> 01:51:23,978
Is that all?

1936
01:51:25,072 --> 01:51:26,385
You could've mentioned this earlier.

1937
01:51:26,979 --> 01:51:28,948
Only one women is creating problem
at the moment.

1938
01:51:30,195 --> 01:51:31,471
It's easy to shut her down.

1939
01:51:32,276 --> 01:51:34,681
Contact your Indian agent and ask him
to speak to her.

1940
01:51:35,088 --> 01:51:36,088
Make an offer.

1941
01:51:36,854 --> 01:51:39,713
That won't amount to even 25% of your
insurance payout.

1942
01:51:53,871 --> 01:51:54,347
Listen...

1943
01:51:55,392 --> 01:51:57,306
why don't you sit down,
if you're not able to take it.

1944
01:51:59,909 --> 01:52:00,744
Your husband...

1945
01:52:01,635 --> 01:52:03,221
is going abroad for the sake of the family,
right?

1946
01:52:06,291 --> 01:52:08,291
That person is not my husband.

1947
01:52:08,526 --> 01:52:11,072
For the sake of Insurance money
from my husband's demise...

1948
01:52:11,705 --> 01:52:15,790
my mother-in-law forced and got me
married to his brother.

1949
01:52:15,890 --> 01:52:19,180
Sister-in-law, Bhai wants to speak to you.

1950
01:52:20,695 --> 01:52:23,985
I've been trying to reach you for two days,
but couldn't get hold of you.

1951
01:52:24,273 --> 01:52:26,321
I heard that you wore down that
Dubai company.

1952
01:52:26,967 --> 01:52:31,102
If not, they would've dragged it long enough
with legalities.

1953
01:52:31,290 --> 01:52:34,844
Thank goodness. Now even the
Dubai Govt. is scared of you.

1954
01:52:37,202 --> 01:52:41,970
Usually insurance coverage happens
instantly for employees in Dubai.

1955
01:52:43,148 --> 01:52:46,406
If an employees dies on duty,
insurance money will be paid right away.

1956
01:52:47,069 --> 01:52:48,555
We never let them getaway with it.

1957
01:52:49,796 --> 01:52:51,210
Most of the companies tend to cheat.

1958
01:52:52,015 --> 01:52:55,009
But my company doesn't,
'cause it's an American company.

1959
01:52:55,485 --> 01:52:56,616
They'll be prompt with payout.

1960
01:52:56,820 --> 01:53:00,203
Your husband has put your name
as the nominee on the insurance.

1961
01:53:00,311 --> 01:53:02,780
Only your name is mentioned on all the
legal documents.

1962
01:53:02,992 --> 01:53:04,383
From the Ten Million insurance payout...

1963
01:53:04,645 --> 01:53:07,597
they're ready to issue five million
right away.

1964
01:53:07,698 --> 01:53:09,347
If we complete the paper formalities...

1965
01:53:09,632 --> 01:53:10,866
we can send the courier today.

1966
01:53:10,921 --> 01:53:12,218
You'll get your money in next fifteen days.

1967
01:53:12,265 --> 01:53:15,163
Do you want me to take that money
and get re-married?

1968
01:53:15,272 --> 01:53:17,741
-I didn't mean to--
-Bhai, get that payment sorted for me.

1969
01:53:18,141 --> 01:53:18,890
Come on, let's go.

1970
01:53:19,851 --> 01:53:20,526
Come on, get up.

1971
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,515
-Can't you hear mom calling you?
-Don't be stubborn, drag her down.

1972
01:53:23,632 --> 01:53:25,069
Bloody woman, get up, let's go.

1973
01:53:25,272 --> 01:53:26,827
-Hey, for the sake of money...
-What the hell is she doing?

1974
01:53:26,997 --> 01:53:28,294
Just for the sake of money.

1975
01:53:28,477 --> 01:53:29,992
How dare you lay your hands
on a pregnant woman?

1976
01:53:30,234 --> 01:53:32,427
-Get lost!
-Don't do it. Let him go.

1977
01:53:32,764 --> 01:53:34,201
Hey, what do you think of yourself?

1978
01:53:35,228 --> 01:53:36,744
[Woman] Who the hell is she?

1979
01:53:36,941 --> 01:53:38,758
Listen, doesn't matter if you're
getting re-married...

1980
01:53:38,884 --> 01:53:41,138
or you plan live your life as a widow.
It's your choice.

1981
01:53:41,566 --> 01:53:43,566
Do it only if it feels right to you.

1982
01:53:43,919 --> 01:53:46,530
If you face any problem,
Ranasingam's house is always open for you.

1983
01:53:46,555 --> 01:53:48,440
You come over anytime,
I'll take care of you for life.

1984
01:53:49,441 --> 01:53:49,996
Understood?

1985
01:53:53,238 --> 01:53:54,191
Be brave!

1986
01:53:56,474 --> 01:53:56,982
Bhai!

1987
01:53:58,340 --> 01:54:00,191
Inform the company that called you.

1988
01:54:00,331 --> 01:54:02,510
I don't want their money,
I only want my husband Ranasingam.

1989
01:54:02,887 --> 01:54:03,535
Understood?

1990
01:54:07,324 --> 01:54:09,886
I did warn you about them.

1991
01:54:10,607 --> 01:54:13,747
What does the government gain
by deceiving the people?

1992
01:54:14,404 --> 01:54:16,685
I totally believed whatever lies
they fed me all this while.

1993
01:54:16,887 --> 01:54:18,302
You're very naive.

1994
01:54:18,991 --> 01:54:20,928
If you believe that government
always speaks the truth...

1995
01:54:21,044 --> 01:54:23,975
then why there are thousands of pending cases
against them in the court?

1996
01:54:25,021 --> 01:54:29,004
Look, government doesn't have the time
to worry about the common man.

1997
01:54:29,717 --> 01:54:31,248
Fine, it's not too late.

1998
01:54:31,569 --> 01:54:33,623
To win, if we have to go supreme court,
we'll do it.

1999
01:54:33,738 --> 01:54:34,230
-Take this.
-Sir...

2000
01:54:34,754 --> 01:54:36,624
the court is my last hope.

2001
01:54:36,739 --> 01:54:39,443
Don't spare any expenses,
even if we had to go to the international court...

2002
01:54:39,639 --> 01:54:41,319
-we'll win the case.
-Okay, sir.

2003
01:54:41,749 --> 01:54:43,482
Tomorrow, I'll file the case at the court.

2004
01:54:43,904 --> 01:54:46,560
In another 10-15 days,
all these officers--

2005
01:54:46,677 --> 01:54:48,443
Sir, why would it take so long?

2006
01:54:48,631 --> 01:54:50,631
Ten to fifteen days is not that long.

2007
01:54:50,724 --> 01:54:53,239
There are people who have spent
all their lives fighting at the court.

2008
01:54:53,598 --> 01:54:55,809
Don't worry.
We'll wrap up your case, sooner.

2009
01:54:56,353 --> 01:54:57,946
Not to worry. You can go now.

2010
01:54:58,442 --> 01:55:02,300
Swaminathan, when were you planning
to get me those documents?

2011
01:55:02,694 --> 01:55:03,861
We have to answer to the court.

2012
01:55:04,106 --> 01:55:06,448
Sir, I'm working on it.
The Embassy is asking for more time.

2013
01:55:07,779 --> 01:55:09,935
How long do they need?
They're dragging this out.

2014
01:55:10,639 --> 01:55:13,963
At least, if you had made that women
understand the problem...

2015
01:55:14,370 --> 01:55:15,464
we could've prevented the hassle
of going to the court.

2016
01:55:15,572 --> 01:55:16,972
Call the Dubai Embassy,
I'll speak to them.

2017
01:55:17,183 --> 01:55:18,402
Just for the sake of one women?

2018
01:55:18,511 --> 01:55:19,776
Whether it's an individual or a village...

2019
01:55:20,760 --> 01:55:22,064
our duty is to resolve their issues.

2020
01:55:22,920 --> 01:55:24,548
Our salaries come out of their tax money.

2021
01:55:25,229 --> 01:55:25,916
Get them online.

2022
01:55:26,207 --> 01:55:26,558
Sir!

2023
01:55:29,659 --> 01:55:31,089
-Please, come.
-What's the issue?

2024
01:55:31,149 --> 01:55:32,479
A person has captured our land.

2025
01:55:32,690 --> 01:55:34,330
It's been a year,
since I filed a petition.

2026
01:55:34,455 --> 01:55:35,439
No action has been taken.

2027
01:55:35,563 --> 01:55:36,613
-What action was taken, Radhakrishnan?
-Sir...

2028
01:55:36,892 --> 01:55:38,386
the VAO is following up on this issue.

2029
01:55:38,720 --> 01:55:39,947
You guys are great at making excuses.

2030
01:55:40,251 --> 01:55:41,206
Sir, we'll get this resolved.

2031
01:55:42,688 --> 01:55:43,712
Check on this matter, right away.

2032
01:55:44,182 --> 01:55:45,391
-You carry on, I'll handle it.
-Thank you, sir.

2033
01:55:46,023 --> 01:55:46,672
Good evening, sir.

2034
01:55:46,884 --> 01:55:47,401
Tell me.

2035
01:55:47,477 --> 01:55:49,767
-This is Ramnad's Collector from Tamilnadu.
-Is it about the dead body?

2036
01:55:49,908 --> 01:55:51,001
-Yes, sir.
-Please, go ahead.

2037
01:55:52,041 --> 01:55:53,807
-Hey, come over here.
-It's about Ranasingam's case.

2038
01:55:54,267 --> 01:55:56,743
It's been eight months.
Now a case is filed in the court.

2039
01:55:57,344 --> 01:55:59,032
We've mailed all the documents to you.

2040
01:55:59,743 --> 01:56:01,050
-We've sent a fax too.
-We received it.

2041
01:56:02,369 --> 01:56:05,056
Let me know, if the family is
asking for more money.

2042
01:56:05,947 --> 01:56:08,571
I'll discuss with the company
and get them a payout.

2043
01:56:08,877 --> 01:56:11,112
No, no, no.
She's not demanding money.

2044
01:56:11,470 --> 01:56:12,000
Okay.

2045
01:56:12,930 --> 01:56:14,837
I'll talk to the local authorities
and get back to you.

2046
01:56:15,170 --> 01:56:16,787
Please get this sorted sooner.

2047
01:56:16,885 --> 01:56:18,620
-I'll try to speed up the process.
-Thank you.

2048
01:56:51,105 --> 01:56:54,449
You're sick.
Why are you toiling yourself?

2049
01:56:56,395 --> 01:56:58,028
My granddaughter, Chenkudi...

2050
01:56:58,988 --> 01:57:00,558
asked me for a candy,

2051
01:57:00,895 --> 01:57:04,118
It's embarrassing that
I couldn't even afford a candy.

2052
01:57:05,406 --> 01:57:09,312
The women of the house
are working hard day and night.

2053
01:57:09,600 --> 01:57:12,303
It's not fair that I sit ducks
and do nothing about it.

2054
01:57:32,546 --> 01:57:33,881
Please hold on. Have some patience.

2055
01:57:36,427 --> 01:57:38,107
Even though they're our relatives...

2056
01:57:40,959 --> 01:57:43,053
you can't let them starve.

2057
01:57:45,123 --> 01:57:48,096
That doesn't mean we can feed them
all the time.

2058
01:57:50,384 --> 01:57:53,682
Indirectly, aunt made a point
about our family.

2059
01:57:55,337 --> 01:57:56,954
They kept us fed all this while.

2060
01:58:00,649 --> 01:58:03,297
Maayi, come on,
go and light the stove.

2061
01:58:03,782 --> 01:58:05,689
-Light the firewood.
-Sister-in-law...

2062
01:58:06,133 --> 01:58:07,838
Whoever invented this ritual...

2063
01:58:08,236 --> 01:58:10,735
died without realizing
the hardship behind it.

2064
01:58:11,479 --> 01:58:12,635
It's not imperative for us to follow.

2065
01:58:13,813 --> 01:58:16,993
Sister-in-law, I don't think,
it's a good omen...

2066
01:58:17,431 --> 01:58:22,259
Do you really know,
who imposed all these restrictions?

2067
01:58:24,409 --> 01:58:26,135
I swear on god,
I have no clue about it.

2068
01:58:27,098 --> 01:58:29,503
And I'm damn sure,
even the god is not aware of these rituals.

2069
01:58:29,666 --> 01:58:31,805
Go. Start preparing lunch.

2070
01:58:35,758 --> 01:58:36,328
Woman...

2071
01:58:37,159 --> 01:58:38,690
you filed a case and have been
lurking around.

2072
01:58:38,792 --> 01:58:40,174
Do you expect us to seek you out?

2073
01:58:40,331 --> 01:58:42,151
If you want your husband,
go to Dubai.

2074
01:58:42,269 --> 01:58:44,104
Instead making our lives a living hell.

2075
01:58:44,634 --> 01:58:46,048
You went to the court right?

2076
01:58:46,830 --> 01:58:47,962
You'll come there again, right?

2077
01:58:48,945 --> 01:58:49,704
We'll see.

2078
01:59:00,464 --> 01:59:02,167
You're wearing a wedding chain.

2079
01:59:02,588 --> 01:59:04,252
So, I tattooed by hand with your name.

2080
01:59:04,430 --> 01:59:07,378
When I shake hands with people,
they ask me about it.

2081
01:59:09,758 --> 01:59:10,456
I tell them it's my wife.

2082
01:59:21,432 --> 01:59:22,110
Give me that.

2083
01:59:25,323 --> 01:59:28,363
Sir, can you add my granddaughter's
name too?

2084
01:59:28,464 --> 01:59:30,418
-What's here name?
-Sengudi.

2085
01:59:30,845 --> 01:59:32,369
-Age?
-She's 2 years old.

2086
01:59:32,682 --> 01:59:34,393
Get me her birth certificate
and Aadhar card.

2087
01:59:36,344 --> 01:59:37,499
What's your annual income?

2088
01:59:39,766 --> 01:59:42,211
I asked.
What's your annual income?

2089
01:59:43,142 --> 01:59:45,218
Sir, we're daily wage workers.

2090
01:59:45,408 --> 01:59:46,932
You can mention what ever
you feel is right.

2091
01:59:47,235 --> 01:59:48,516
Are you kidding me?

2092
01:59:48,596 --> 01:59:50,330
Does no one go to a job in this house?

2093
01:59:51,790 --> 01:59:53,516
Your lies are not convincing enough.

2094
01:59:54,048 --> 01:59:56,282
In fact, my brother...

2095
01:59:57,542 --> 01:59:58,534
used to work in Dubai.

2096
01:59:59,049 --> 02:00:00,557
Oh, he used to work abroad.

2097
02:00:01,259 --> 02:00:04,719
You people are hiding that fact
and reaping poor people's benefits.

2098
02:00:04,984 --> 02:00:06,798
Rightfully, you should hold the white card.

2099
02:00:07,025 --> 02:00:09,236
But you're holding a green card
and exploiting its benefits.

2100
02:00:10,017 --> 02:00:11,236
What will you do,
if I cancel the card?

2101
02:00:12,253 --> 02:00:14,003
Sir, we didn't mean to--

2102
02:00:14,042 --> 02:00:16,503
Shut up. You're aware on how to add
the child's name to the card.

2103
02:00:16,790 --> 02:00:18,118
But you can't mention that your brother
works abroad.

2104
02:00:18,283 --> 02:00:20,253
The next house belongs to you, right?

2105
02:00:20,530 --> 02:00:21,562
You can afford to build a new house.

2106
02:00:21,850 --> 02:00:23,151
Aren't you ashamed
to cheat the government--

2107
02:00:23,176 --> 02:00:24,175
Hey, shut the hell up!

2108
02:00:24,604 --> 02:00:25,619
You're going overboard.

2109
02:00:25,678 --> 02:00:27,498
Which awful government
are you talking about?

2110
02:00:27,811 --> 02:00:30,038
You seriously think that my family depends
on the free groceries offered by the Govt.?

2111
02:00:30,209 --> 02:00:31,993
Or do you think we live off your charity?

2112
02:00:32,061 --> 02:00:34,175
How dare you accuse us of fraud?

2113
02:00:34,274 --> 02:00:37,601
As if the government cares
if the people get their rightful share.

2114
02:00:37,743 --> 02:00:39,928
You people steal our share
and sell them for money.

2115
02:00:41,023 --> 02:00:43,287
If you think I'm at your mercy...

2116
02:00:43,327 --> 02:00:44,878
I'd rather die, than living off it.

2117
02:00:45,013 --> 02:00:46,760
You're going to strike
our names off this list?

2118
02:00:46,823 --> 02:00:48,881
-They're Govt. documents.
-I care a damn, take it away.

2119
02:00:48,906 --> 02:00:51,245
You can write at your will.
Mention that we're not Indian Citizens.

2120
02:00:51,478 --> 02:00:53,048
We're already in a dire state.

2121
02:00:53,157 --> 02:00:55,054
How dare you threaten a Govt. officer?

2122
02:00:55,948 --> 02:00:57,864
I'll make sure that you
and your family are behind the bars.

2123
02:00:57,889 --> 02:01:01,034
Another word,
I'll kill you and surrender myself.

2124
02:01:01,077 --> 02:01:02,421
I'll show you the power of government.

2125
02:01:02,555 --> 02:01:03,893
-You're going to regret.
-Get lost!

2126
02:01:04,688 --> 02:01:06,176
-Morons!
-Dear, don't mess with them.

2127
02:01:06,286 --> 02:01:07,755
-Mother-in-law, you please go inside.
-Sister, what's wrong with you?

2128
02:01:22,303 --> 02:01:24,490
Look at her, she's got too many pots
to fill water.

2129
02:01:24,584 --> 02:01:27,045
How is she going to manage
and take them all.

2130
02:01:27,263 --> 02:01:30,232
She'll turn into Hanuman
and fly these pots to her house.

2131
02:01:30,350 --> 02:01:32,006
-You wouldn't know.
-Is that so?

2132
02:01:32,152 --> 02:01:33,363
Yeah, right!

2133
02:01:38,733 --> 02:01:41,818
Ariyanachi, is there any update
about Ranasingam?

2134
02:01:46,123 --> 02:01:47,850
Sister, let me go first...

2135
02:01:47,921 --> 02:01:48,748
I have pending chores at home.

2136
02:01:48,819 --> 02:01:50,905
We too have a lot of chores
to tend to.

2137
02:01:51,022 --> 02:01:53,459
We all know what you're rushing for.

2138
02:01:53,662 --> 02:01:55,896
I'm married with two kids,
I can feel you, sister.

2139
02:01:56,067 --> 02:01:58,614
Everyone out here are facing
the same issue.

2140
02:01:59,170 --> 02:02:01,522
I know all about your chores, woman.

2141
02:02:01,710 --> 02:02:04,358
-She's a new bride.
-Is that so?

2142
02:02:04,640 --> 02:02:06,960
It's not like,
she's the only one married here.

2143
02:02:07,889 --> 02:02:10,904
I don't wanna mess with you guys.
I'll wait for my turn.

2144
02:02:53,502 --> 02:02:56,775
I had asked all the Govt. officers
involved to appear today.

2145
02:02:57,095 --> 02:02:57,994
Yes, your honor!

2146
02:02:58,229 --> 02:03:00,182
-What about defense?
-Yes, your honor.

2147
02:03:09,204 --> 02:03:09,705
Greetings!

2148
02:03:10,158 --> 02:03:12,845
What is the reason for this
inordinate delay, collector?

2149
02:03:13,211 --> 02:03:14,734
Even if he's a criminal...

2150
02:03:15,064 --> 02:03:18,647
it's not right to hold off the final rites.

2151
02:03:19,111 --> 02:03:23,451
It's not our intention to stop people
from exercising their rights.

2152
02:03:24,104 --> 02:03:26,546
As the investigation
is in the initial stage...

2153
02:03:26,678 --> 02:03:29,345
the Dubai government
has asked for more time.

2154
02:03:29,735 --> 02:03:31,047
That doesn't mean we're sitting ducks.

2155
02:03:31,307 --> 02:03:32,306
We're putting pressure on them.

2156
02:03:32,815 --> 02:03:34,932
For how long? It's been ten months.

2157
02:03:35,064 --> 02:03:36,314
What action has been taken?

2158
02:03:36,381 --> 02:03:40,234
Your honor, all details
pertaining to the case is in this file.

2159
02:03:53,804 --> 02:03:55,931
I'm not able to agree
to what you're saying.

2160
02:03:56,153 --> 02:04:00,522
Only after a case was filed
to recover her husband's body...

2161
02:04:01,218 --> 02:04:04,234
you have mentioned about
six pending cases on Ranasingam.

2162
02:04:05,357 --> 02:04:07,614
Why there was no action taken?

2163
02:04:07,750 --> 02:04:09,022
They staged a protest
demanding water supply.

2164
02:04:10,210 --> 02:04:13,658
After the protest ended, neither the
VO nor Thasildar registered a complaint.

2165
02:04:13,998 --> 02:04:16,627
That's why we didn't proceed further,
hence the case is pending.

2166
02:04:16,880 --> 02:04:19,627
Are you responsible
for Ranasingam working abroad?

2167
02:04:19,865 --> 02:04:23,357
Sir, it's usual for people to protest.

2168
02:04:23,942 --> 02:04:26,951
We can't state someone as a criminal,
just 'cause they led the protest.

2169
02:04:27,460 --> 02:04:29,476
Not every protestor is anti-social.

2170
02:04:29,960 --> 02:04:34,897
Moreover, as a Collector, I didn't want a
citizen to stop from going abroad to work.

2171
02:04:36,153 --> 02:04:39,273
You were ignorant of the fact
and let him go abroad...

2172
02:04:39,741 --> 02:04:41,303
And he staged a protest
out there as well.

2173
02:04:42,428 --> 02:04:44,404
He got killed in the riots.

2174
02:04:45,501 --> 02:04:48,488
Now his wife has filed a case
to recover his body.

2175
02:04:48,662 --> 02:04:50,975
If someone of his stature goes abroad...

2176
02:04:51,171 --> 02:04:53,670
isn't it vital to keep an eye
on that person.

2177
02:04:54,624 --> 02:04:57,123
If he ends up committing a crime,
who'll take the responsibility?

2178
02:04:57,569 --> 02:04:58,428
They'll blame our country.

2179
02:04:58,969 --> 02:04:59,750
Fine, ignore that.

2180
02:05:00,352 --> 02:05:02,602
Now what do we tell her?

2181
02:05:02,967 --> 02:05:05,866
My lord, the body can't be dispatched
until the case is closed...

2182
02:05:06,115 --> 02:05:08,072
Dubai Ministry of External Affairs
has mentioned it in their letter.

2183
02:05:08,189 --> 02:05:09,740
We've already submitted that letter.

2184
02:05:09,967 --> 02:05:12,380
She claims her husband didn't die
in a protest...

2185
02:05:12,913 --> 02:05:14,412
but he died in an industrial accident.

2186
02:05:14,882 --> 02:05:18,170
The Oil company is trying to cover up
the accident.

2187
02:05:18,554 --> 02:05:21,678
Did the Indian Embassy
investigate on this matter?

2188
02:05:21,975 --> 02:05:23,615
Has there been any reports filed
pertaining to it?

2189
02:05:24,233 --> 02:05:25,842
Is the spokesperson of that oil company
present here?

2190
02:05:26,083 --> 02:05:28,724
No, your honor.
It's an international company.

2191
02:05:28,921 --> 02:05:29,529
So...

2192
02:05:29,577 --> 02:05:32,444
International companies
are not above the Indian law and order.

2193
02:05:33,240 --> 02:05:34,935
They're legally bound to appear
in the court.

2194
02:05:35,029 --> 02:05:37,349
The reason why we didn't summon them...

2195
02:05:37,640 --> 02:05:40,834
is because no accident occurred
on the date she claims,

2196
02:05:41,105 --> 02:05:44,519
Dubai Police, Indian Commissionaire,
Labor welfare department,

2197
02:05:44,700 --> 02:05:46,068
has verified the same.

2198
02:05:46,195 --> 02:05:47,913
If they've verified. Where's the report?

2199
02:05:47,957 --> 02:05:49,261
Please produce them in the court.

2200
02:05:49,582 --> 02:05:52,348
Ma'am, once the case is closed and
the body has been dispatched to India

2201
02:05:52,608 --> 02:05:54,715
-we'll have all the required documents--
-Your Honor!

2202
02:05:55,523 --> 02:05:56,171
Your Honor!

2203
02:05:56,833 --> 02:05:59,973
It's hard to believe that he died
'cause of riots during a protest.

2204
02:06:00,137 --> 02:06:01,214
Do they have evidence to support?

2205
02:06:01,562 --> 02:06:02,952
Do they have a video proof?

2206
02:06:03,419 --> 02:06:05,552
Why is it taking ten months
to identify the body?

2207
02:06:05,802 --> 02:06:09,757
Mr.Mayilehri, do you think he wouldn't have
protested out there?

2208
02:06:11,287 --> 02:06:14,795
In any case, for two countries
to conspire his death...

2209
02:06:14,965 --> 02:06:16,441
the accused is not
such an important person.

2210
02:06:17,904 --> 02:06:19,530
My point is not about
which country is to benefit.

2211
02:06:19,653 --> 02:06:21,812
But the Oil company is surely
benefiting from this.

2212
02:06:21,899 --> 02:06:24,617
If we wish to know the truth,
you can check the company's website,

2213
02:06:24,695 --> 02:06:27,992
has full details on their company's
insurance policy.

2214
02:06:38,254 --> 02:06:39,214
Okay, forget about that.

2215
02:06:40,199 --> 02:06:44,533
There's an FIR filed on Ranasingam
interfering into a woman's family matter.

2216
02:06:44,743 --> 02:06:46,595
What do you call that? Social service?

2217
02:06:46,997 --> 02:06:48,568
That's a fabricated case, your honor.

2218
02:06:48,708 --> 02:06:50,364
The people related to that case are here.

2219
02:06:50,572 --> 02:06:52,228
If you allow me,
I'll investigate them--

2220
02:06:52,253 --> 02:06:53,697
There's no need to investigate them.

2221
02:06:53,814 --> 02:06:56,064
They have nothing to do with this case.

2222
02:06:56,896 --> 02:07:01,548
Do you have evidence apart from this
to prove they're a fraud?

2223
02:07:01,630 --> 02:07:04,622
If you give us a weeks' time,
I can provide you the evidence.

2224
02:07:07,670 --> 02:07:13,205
Mr.Myilehri, don't project
an accused criminal as a hero.

2225
02:07:13,635 --> 02:07:15,384
Sir, I believed in the system.

2226
02:07:15,480 --> 02:07:17,441
I don't care if the court
does right by me.

2227
02:07:17,535 --> 02:07:21,579
But please don't call my husband
a criminal based on their lies.

2228
02:07:21,740 --> 02:07:22,908
You can live according to the system.

2229
02:07:23,053 --> 02:07:24,490
Is it possible to die
according to the system?

2230
02:07:24,605 --> 02:07:25,219
Silence!

2231
02:07:25,384 --> 02:07:27,118
-Police please take you hands off her.
-Silence.

2232
02:07:28,959 --> 02:07:29,560
Please proceed.

2233
02:07:30,386 --> 02:07:30,948
Sir...

2234
02:07:32,002 --> 02:07:35,064
It's been ten months since I reported
my husband's death.

2235
02:07:36,252 --> 02:07:37,853
Everyone kept making excuses...

2236
02:07:38,087 --> 02:07:40,540
and kept stalling without any resolution.

2237
02:07:41,190 --> 02:07:44,900
I was not looking for
any kind of compensation.

2238
02:07:46,642 --> 02:07:48,662
Please just bring my husband back.

2239
02:07:49,509 --> 02:07:50,486
I'm not asking for anything else.

2240
02:08:04,233 --> 02:08:05,640
Judgment reserved!

2241
02:08:08,546 --> 02:08:11,530
Based on the case filed by
Ms.Ariyanachi...

2242
02:08:11,757 --> 02:08:14,218
the court has reserved judgment
based on the investigation.

2243
02:08:14,476 --> 02:08:18,491
Also keeping in mind the arguments
from the Government and the Police.

2244
02:08:18,959 --> 02:08:20,521
After taking a closer look at everything.

2245
02:08:20,725 --> 02:08:25,725
Mr.Ranasingam,
failed to be a regular Indian citizen...

2246
02:08:26,278 --> 02:08:27,653
didn't respect the law and order,

2247
02:08:27,833 --> 02:08:31,027
and indulged in anti-social activities.

2248
02:08:31,224 --> 02:08:32,989
Now we have a clear picture about it.

2249
02:08:33,593 --> 02:08:36,756
A person of this stature,
after visiting abroad...

2250
02:08:37,038 --> 02:08:41,788
according to the evidence provided
by the government on his behaviour

2251
02:08:42,085 --> 02:08:43,248
we can concur with them.

2252
02:08:43,789 --> 02:08:46,072
Moreover, based on the
petitioner's claim...

2253
02:08:46,445 --> 02:08:49,484
about the conspiracy
spun by the oil company

2254
02:08:49,796 --> 02:08:52,240
has not been proved by the defense.

2255
02:08:58,354 --> 02:09:02,924
The case about bringing Ranasingam's body
back to India...

2256
02:09:03,281 --> 02:09:07,701
taking district collector's
evidence into account

2257
02:09:08,390 --> 02:09:12,900
As two countries are involved
in this matter...

2258
02:09:13,116 --> 02:09:15,240
in order to proceed further

2259
02:09:15,475 --> 02:09:21,771
the court requests the petitioner to
contact the appropriate representatives.

2260
02:09:22,334 --> 02:09:26,208
Due to unavoidable reasons,
the petitioner's claim is rejected...

2261
02:09:26,536 --> 02:09:28,818
and the court has dismissed the case.

2262
02:09:56,202 --> 02:09:59,133
Sir, you're not going to resolve
my problem.

2263
02:09:59,240 --> 02:10:02,927
Until you do so,
every forest will burn to ashes.

2264
02:10:03,598 --> 02:10:05,887
No one witnessed Kannagi
burning down Madurai.

2265
02:10:06,582 --> 02:10:10,222
The entire world is going to witness
Ariyanachi burning down Ramanathapuram.

2266
02:10:10,756 --> 02:10:11,435
Your point?

2267
02:10:12,935 --> 02:10:14,379
The world might be amused by it.

2268
02:10:14,981 --> 02:10:19,387
But if you encounter even a
small problem...

2269
02:10:19,944 --> 02:10:22,162
either me or the government
should come forward.

2270
02:10:22,358 --> 02:10:23,404
You weren't a help at all.

2271
02:10:23,912 --> 02:10:27,524
Instead you insulted my dead husband
in the court.

2272
02:10:28,185 --> 02:10:30,934
Don't think the Collector has the power
to solve all the problems.

2273
02:10:31,981 --> 02:10:34,043
My authority is limited to India.

2274
02:10:34,403 --> 02:10:36,922
If it was within our country,
I would've interfered in the matter.

2275
02:10:37,599 --> 02:10:38,899
But it's pertaining to another country.

2276
02:10:39,958 --> 02:10:41,810
There are specific structures
to handle these matters.

2277
02:10:42,646 --> 02:10:43,833
We can only go through them.

2278
02:10:43,935 --> 02:10:46,547
Does it take ten months to achieve that?

2279
02:10:47,533 --> 02:10:49,493
Yes, I agree.

2280
02:10:50,045 --> 02:10:50,891
It was delayed.

2281
02:10:51,756 --> 02:10:53,200
But we progressed.

2282
02:10:53,786 --> 02:10:57,930
Now that you've explained yourself to me,
are you going to inform the press too?

2283
02:10:58,083 --> 02:10:59,474
Why should I be worried about them?

2284
02:10:59,973 --> 02:11:02,618
Before I'm done explaining,
they'll be handed another breaking news.

2285
02:11:03,309 --> 02:11:06,004
I'm just worried about your situation.

2286
02:11:06,528 --> 02:11:09,177
Are you worried or scared?

2287
02:11:09,904 --> 02:11:10,810
I'm not scared.

2288
02:11:11,743 --> 02:11:13,613
Call the Police and arrest me.

2289
02:11:13,897 --> 02:11:15,193
Why should I arrest you?

2290
02:11:15,474 --> 02:11:16,993
It's enough I rat you out to the villagers.

2291
02:11:17,202 --> 02:11:21,139
This babul forest is of no use
to me neither to the nation.

2292
02:11:21,266 --> 02:11:22,289
It's the same for the people too.

2293
02:11:22,875 --> 02:11:25,696
You did this out of spite,
but you did a favor to this nation.

2294
02:11:26,492 --> 02:11:31,149
So, I'm not going to tell anyone
about this matter.

2295
02:11:36,522 --> 02:11:38,991
[News] Babul trees at Thalanoor
were burned to ashes.

2296
02:11:39,463 --> 02:11:40,212
Ariyanachi.

2297
02:11:41,048 --> 02:11:41,743
Ariyanachi!

2298
02:11:42,758 --> 02:11:47,290
The Collector helped me get my share
of Insurance money from my in-laws.

2299
02:11:48,389 --> 02:11:51,351
Ranasingam would've done the same,
if he was alive.

2300
02:11:52,330 --> 02:11:55,571
I believe he came in the form of the Collector
and helped me out.

2301
02:11:57,794 --> 02:12:02,000
I didn't want to be around them,
so I rented a house in town.

2302
02:12:02,897 --> 02:12:04,905
I'm working at a petrol bunk
near my house.

2303
02:12:07,678 --> 02:12:10,518
When you're in town,
please visit us.

2304
02:12:11,475 --> 02:12:12,142
Okay, sister.

2305
02:12:15,251 --> 02:12:16,453
[News] Breaking News!

2306
02:12:16,791 --> 02:12:19,446
Popular Indian actress Sirdevi
passed away in Dubai.

2307
02:12:19,583 --> 02:12:21,096
She died at the age of fifty four.

2308
02:12:21,244 --> 02:12:23,614
She made her debut in Tamil cinema
as a child artist.

2309
02:12:23,718 --> 02:12:28,836
Not only in South India,
she carved a niche space in Bollywood too.

2310
02:12:28,943 --> 02:12:33,594
Indian Prime Minister extended his condolences
as a loss to Indian Cinema.

2311
02:12:40,247 --> 02:12:42,194
Mom, why are you sulking now?

2312
02:12:44,998 --> 02:12:45,474
Dad!

2313
02:12:47,444 --> 02:12:48,209
I'm going to Chennai.

2314
02:12:49,297 --> 02:12:51,802
You keep checking on my in-laws.

2315
02:12:52,872 --> 02:12:54,090
You can't go all by yourself.

2316
02:12:54,655 --> 02:12:56,045
Please take your father along.

2317
02:12:56,561 --> 02:12:58,431
I can't always be dependent on others.

2318
02:12:59,608 --> 02:13:01,750
At one juncture,
everyone has to lookout for themselves.

2319
02:13:04,537 --> 02:13:05,247
I'm going.

2320
02:13:09,102 --> 02:13:11,110
Mother-in-law, I've reached.

2321
02:13:12,001 --> 02:13:13,008
Stop crying!

2322
02:13:13,485 --> 02:13:16,476
I'll handle it.
You don't have to worry.

2323
02:13:17,173 --> 02:13:19,110
-I'll talk to you later.
-Okay, dear.

2324
02:13:29,082 --> 02:13:29,653
Oh, no!

2325
02:13:36,708 --> 02:13:37,617
Stay right here.

2326
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:02,461
Oh, no!

2327
02:14:02,523 --> 02:14:04,460
How can you leave your kid unattended
on the road?

2328
02:14:04,538 --> 02:14:05,999
I saw that the water was
going to waste.

2329
02:14:06,115 --> 02:14:08,178
That doesn't mean you can leave your child
on the road.

2330
02:14:08,426 --> 02:14:11,181
I know the value of water,
'cause our lands parched.

2331
02:14:11,251 --> 02:14:13,244
Your social service would've cost the life
of your child.

2332
02:14:13,344 --> 02:14:14,525
For god sake, please forgive me.

2333
02:14:14,655 --> 02:14:15,740
Damn with your apology.

2334
02:14:15,952 --> 02:14:18,107
Brother, she's apologizing right?

2335
02:14:18,333 --> 02:14:19,676
Hello, who the hell are you?

2336
02:14:19,880 --> 02:14:20,997
Do you even know what happened
out here?

2337
02:14:21,022 --> 02:14:23,154
Damn you,
she apologized for her mistake.

2338
02:14:23,187 --> 02:14:23,968
You don't have to hit me
for that.

2339
02:14:24,023 --> 02:14:25,296
Get lost, damn it.

2340
02:14:26,185 --> 02:14:27,294
Get lost. Go!

2341
02:14:29,061 --> 02:14:29,874
Thank you very much.

2342
02:14:30,874 --> 02:14:32,162
You haven't changed a bit, Nachi.

2343
02:14:33,491 --> 02:14:35,990
I'm Guna Sekar. Your schoolmate.

2344
02:14:37,005 --> 02:14:39,762
Sekar. You look totally different now.

2345
02:14:40,270 --> 02:14:42,943
I'm happy that,
this city just changed my appearance.

2346
02:14:44,675 --> 02:14:46,357
How come you're here?
Are you here alone?

2347
02:14:46,475 --> 02:14:47,330
Where's your husband?

2348
02:14:50,318 --> 02:14:51,497
Are you here to meet someone?

2349
02:15:00,279 --> 02:15:02,694
Nachi, I work nearby.

2350
02:15:03,185 --> 02:15:04,370
My wife runs a flower shop.

2351
02:15:04,919 --> 02:15:06,450
We'll meet her and then I'll take you
to my place.

2352
02:15:06,577 --> 02:15:08,194
Nachi, how's your dad doing?

2353
02:15:09,623 --> 02:15:11,568
Nachi, I asked, how's your dad?

2354
02:15:12,569 --> 02:15:13,295
He's doing well.

2355
02:15:15,436 --> 02:15:16,428
-Meena!
-Yeah.

2356
02:15:16,764 --> 02:15:19,076
This is Ariyanachi. She's my relative.

2357
02:15:19,303 --> 02:15:20,905
-She's come from Ramanathapuram.
-Oh, is it?

2358
02:15:21,038 --> 02:15:22,194
This is my wife, Meena.

2359
02:15:22,396 --> 02:15:25,287
Please buy some flowers.
Everything is fresh.

2360
02:15:25,444 --> 02:15:27,202
How much do you need?

2361
02:15:29,163 --> 02:15:31,210
I didn't bring her to buy flowers.

2362
02:15:31,429 --> 02:15:33,772
-Then?
-She's my schoolmate.

2363
02:15:34,117 --> 02:15:35,577
Since she arrived,
she looks kind of upset.

2364
02:15:35,851 --> 02:15:37,405
Not sure what happened.
You take her home.

2365
02:15:37,538 --> 02:15:38,412
We'll discuss later.

2366
02:15:38,490 --> 02:15:40,248
If I go home,
who's going to sell these flowers.

2367
02:15:40,421 --> 02:15:41,655
You please leave.
I'll take care of the business.

2368
02:15:41,828 --> 02:15:43,202
-Come on, let's leave.
-What happened, Nachi?

2369
02:15:43,827 --> 02:15:45,757
Sekar, I have an important work
to tend to.

2370
02:15:46,131 --> 02:15:48,904
The office will open at 10 am,
I'll finish my work and leave.

2371
02:15:49,007 --> 02:15:49,663
Oh, is it.

2372
02:15:50,546 --> 02:15:52,014
Then go home and freshen up.

2373
02:15:52,265 --> 02:15:53,293
I'll take you wherever you have to go.

2374
02:15:55,160 --> 02:15:56,160
Don't cry, dear.

2375
02:15:56,599 --> 02:15:58,029
Listen, Nachi...

2376
02:15:58,434 --> 02:16:00,738
do you have our school group picture?

2377
02:16:00,801 --> 02:16:02,637
When you're leaving home,
I'll give it to you.

2378
02:16:08,489 --> 02:16:11,067
-What is it?
-I'm here to meet External Affairs officer.

2379
02:16:11,588 --> 02:16:13,948
You'll find a queue on the left.
Wait over there.

2380
02:16:14,020 --> 02:16:14,410
Okay.

2381
02:16:15,730 --> 02:16:16,730
Okay, okay, okay.

2382
02:16:16,964 --> 02:16:18,526
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

2383
02:16:18,816 --> 02:16:19,964
That's about it.

2384
02:16:20,534 --> 02:16:21,378
Look over there.

2385
02:16:22,050 --> 02:16:23,346
Laughing, is it?

2386
02:16:24,144 --> 02:16:25,239
-What's your name?
-Balaraman.

2387
02:16:25,288 --> 02:16:26,451
-Where are you from?
-Tambram.

2388
02:16:29,455 --> 02:16:30,986
Head to the last cabin
for Immigrant department.

2389
02:16:31,074 --> 02:16:31,730
Okay.

2390
02:16:42,317 --> 02:16:43,154
Tell me. What is it?

2391
02:16:44,599 --> 02:16:47,435
Sir, I'm coming from Ramanathapuram.

2392
02:16:47,630 --> 02:16:50,935
My husband died in an accident
while he was on job abroad.

2393
02:16:51,138 --> 02:16:51,786
Which country?

2394
02:16:52,989 --> 02:16:53,794
Dubai.

2395
02:16:54,002 --> 02:16:57,045
Arab Emirates? Let me check the details.
Please wait.

2396
02:16:57,753 --> 02:17:01,732
The information to your District Collector
was sent by our office.

2397
02:17:01,904 --> 02:17:03,841
Now, why are you here?

2398
02:17:04,239 --> 02:17:05,513
Why did you go to the court?

2399
02:17:05,630 --> 02:17:07,544
One of my husband's colleague informed...

2400
02:17:07,569 --> 02:17:09,897
that he died in an accident on job, abroad.

2401
02:17:10,108 --> 02:17:13,492
But that company and their Government
are denying it.

2402
02:17:14,484 --> 02:17:16,998
I filed a case hoping they'll agree
to the truth.

2403
02:17:17,570 --> 02:17:19,499
But they lied through their teeth
in the court.

2404
02:17:20,413 --> 02:17:24,959
I have no clue or an idea
to whom to ask for help.

2405
02:17:25,848 --> 02:17:30,185
Sir, if you could call abroad
and help me get this sorted.

2406
02:17:30,561 --> 02:17:34,131
I need a weeks' time to check
on the complaint filed.

2407
02:17:34,482 --> 02:17:35,130
Come back later.

2408
02:17:35,320 --> 02:17:37,435
Nachi, what exactly happened?

2409
02:17:38,852 --> 02:17:42,328
I was not lucky enough to spend my life
with my husband.

2410
02:17:42,705 --> 02:17:45,817
Shall I ask the councilor
from my area for a favor?

2411
02:17:46,602 --> 02:17:49,495
Shekar, even the MLA from our district
couldn't do anything.

2412
02:17:53,848 --> 02:17:55,230
Excuse me, madam.

2413
02:17:56,198 --> 02:17:58,276
Did your husband die while in abroad?

2414
02:17:59,763 --> 02:18:02,084
At the Marina beach opposite to
MGR's tomb...

2415
02:18:02,153 --> 02:18:03,443
there's a place called Ezhilaga.

2416
02:18:03,584 --> 02:18:05,732
There you'll find WNRT office.

2417
02:18:05,857 --> 02:18:10,099
At that office they help people bring
their dead relatives from abroad.

2418
02:18:10,402 --> 02:18:10,935
Sir.

2419
02:18:12,037 --> 02:18:12,528
Sir.

2420
02:18:14,753 --> 02:18:17,565
Sir, I came down from Ramanathapuram.

2421
02:18:17,878 --> 02:18:20,112
-Tell me.
-Sir, we'd gone to ME's office.

2422
02:18:20,520 --> 02:18:21,754
But we were asked to visit
this office.

2423
02:18:21,855 --> 02:18:24,417
-Is it the matter of death in abroad?
-Yes, sir.

2424
02:18:25,480 --> 02:18:28,034
We don't deal with those cases.
They're responsible for it.

2425
02:18:28,207 --> 02:18:30,003
I wonder why they would send you
over here.

2426
02:18:30,316 --> 02:18:31,761
It's better you contact them.

2427
02:18:32,285 --> 02:18:33,566
Sir, we just came from there.

2428
02:18:33,715 --> 02:18:35,621
They're known for making excuses.

2429
02:18:36,277 --> 02:18:38,998
Fine, you guys do one thing.
Look for a Punjabi wearing a turban...

2430
02:18:39,223 --> 02:18:39,949
you go and meet them.

2431
02:18:41,402 --> 02:18:42,847
Sir, we just met him at the other office.

2432
02:18:42,972 --> 02:18:44,534
There are more than 10-15 Punjabi's
out there.

2433
02:18:44,769 --> 02:18:47,167
I was talking about Rajendran Singh, IAS.

2434
02:18:47,644 --> 02:18:48,394
Go and meet him.

2435
02:18:53,035 --> 02:18:53,781
Let's leave.

2436
02:19:01,156 --> 02:19:03,851
Are you serious? How did it happen?

2437
02:19:04,046 --> 02:19:06,046
Did you inquire in which country
it happened?

2438
02:19:06,422 --> 02:19:07,515
She never said anything.

2439
02:19:08,648 --> 02:19:11,930
I knew, only when she was mentioning this
to the officer.

2440
02:19:13,734 --> 02:19:14,726
I didn't wanna bother her.

2441
02:19:15,914 --> 02:19:17,030
I was feeling awkward.

2442
02:19:17,219 --> 02:19:19,820
You were with her, right?
What did those crooks say?

2443
02:19:20,323 --> 02:19:22,409
What else do you think?
The usual excuses.

2444
02:19:22,882 --> 02:19:23,983
They kept pushing us around.

2445
02:19:24,155 --> 02:19:26,858
They made us hop from desk to desk,
only to be given excuses.

2446
02:19:27,444 --> 02:19:29,756
There was this guy who replied
playing games on his phone.

2447
02:19:31,516 --> 02:19:35,734
Pah! Can't believe that people
have forgotten to empathize.

2448
02:19:37,805 --> 02:19:39,902
There are many departments
in the government...

2449
02:19:40,554 --> 02:19:43,534
they're are not available
to help people like us,

2450
02:19:44,148 --> 02:19:47,819
They're only fit to trouble
hapless people like us.

2451
02:20:06,787 --> 02:20:07,364
Wait.

2452
02:20:08,701 --> 02:20:09,233
Open your bag

2453
02:20:12,835 --> 02:20:14,268
Hey, what's that noise?

2454
02:20:14,380 --> 02:20:15,707
-Hey, what is this?
-Sir, it's a Talisman.

2455
02:20:15,795 --> 02:20:17,994
-Are you sure it's just Talisman?
-Yes, I'm sure.

2456
02:20:18,397 --> 02:20:20,107
Fine, keep it moving.

2457
02:20:23,787 --> 02:20:27,061
We're here to solve our issues.
Not to harm anyone.

2458
02:20:28,499 --> 02:20:30,866
It's been six months,
I haven't got senior citizen pension yet.

2459
02:20:31,109 --> 02:20:32,449
Please get this sorted sooner.

2460
02:20:32,538 --> 02:20:34,537
-I'll be grateful.
-Okay, ma'am. Please leave.

2461
02:20:35,015 --> 02:20:35,796
Where's your petition?

2462
02:20:35,945 --> 02:20:38,397
Sir, I wish to meet the Chief Minister
in person and give him my petition.

2463
02:20:38,468 --> 02:20:39,858
Then why did you hog the queue?

2464
02:20:39,906 --> 02:20:41,155
Sir, my husband died in an accident
in Dubai--

2465
02:20:41,225 --> 02:20:43,296
I don't care where your husband died.

2466
02:20:43,397 --> 02:20:44,741
Please write it down as a petition
and submit it.

2467
02:20:44,780 --> 02:20:47,288
Please stop bothering me in the morning.
Get lost.

2468
02:20:47,393 --> 02:20:48,648
-Ma'am please leave.
-Sir, please hear me out.

2469
02:20:48,781 --> 02:20:51,327
Sir, her husband,
died in Dubai while on the job.

2470
02:20:51,390 --> 02:20:52,663
Hello, didn't you hear what he said?

2471
02:20:52,703 --> 02:20:54,061
You've submitted the petition, right?
Move from here.

2472
02:20:54,163 --> 02:20:55,553
Sir, I've submitted enough petitions.

2473
02:20:55,648 --> 02:20:57,546
I've submitted petitions
at every possible department.

2474
02:20:57,772 --> 02:20:59,905
Meeting Chief Minister in person,
will resolve my issue.

2475
02:20:59,993 --> 02:21:00,523
Please leave from here.

2476
02:21:00,608 --> 02:21:02,998
Sir, sir, sir... please hear me out
and help me on this matter.

2477
02:21:03,554 --> 02:21:04,882
-Please, sir.
-I said, leave from here.

2478
02:21:05,015 --> 02:21:07,887
Sekar, any petition given out here
will be thrown in garbage.

2479
02:21:08,058 --> 02:21:10,058
I won't move until I meet
the Chief Minister.

2480
02:21:10,232 --> 02:21:11,770
I want to bring back
my husband's body.

2481
02:21:12,130 --> 02:21:13,325
Let go. Let go of me.

2482
02:21:13,395 --> 02:21:15,441
Please, sir.
Do something about it.

2483
02:21:15,534 --> 02:21:17,049
-I'll take her away.
-Get out from here.

2484
02:21:17,137 --> 02:21:18,620
Please, sir, do something about it.

2485
02:21:19,165 --> 02:21:21,585
Sekar, you saw how they're ill treating us.

2486
02:21:21,760 --> 02:21:23,487
Sekar, I want to bring my husband back.

2487
02:21:23,550 --> 02:21:24,682
I don't how to bring him back.

2488
02:21:24,753 --> 02:21:26,667
Sekar, I have to meet the Chief Minister.

2489
02:21:26,794 --> 02:21:28,458
Sekar, you can see how unjust
these people are.

2490
02:21:28,583 --> 02:21:30,427
Sekar, do something.
They're pushing me away.

2491
02:21:30,482 --> 02:21:31,645
Sekar, please do something.

2492
02:21:31,693 --> 02:21:33,651
Sekar, we have to do something
and bring my husband back.

2493
02:21:33,793 --> 02:21:36,397
-Sekar, make the meeting happen.
-I'll try. First, let's go from here.

2494
02:21:36,690 --> 02:21:38,098
Sekar, please do something.

2495
02:21:38,622 --> 02:21:39,622
Nachi, Nachi, Nachi...

2496
02:21:40,027 --> 02:21:42,577
My husband-- My husband!

2497
02:21:43,839 --> 02:21:45,811
-My husband...
-Nachi, go from here.

2498
02:21:48,596 --> 02:21:49,817
Sir, please take her away from here.

2499
02:21:49,927 --> 02:21:51,685
Please, let her go.
I'll take care of her.

2500
02:21:51,732 --> 02:21:53,083
-Go!
-I'll handle her.

2501
02:21:53,613 --> 02:21:56,382
Somehow, I have to bring back
my husband.

2502
02:21:58,496 --> 02:22:00,874
I have to bring him back.

2503
02:22:01,941 --> 02:22:04,000
Somehow, I have to bring back
my husband.

2504
02:22:16,985 --> 02:22:19,842
Nachi, something to drink for the child?

2505
02:22:38,371 --> 02:22:39,315
Hey, get back!

2506
02:22:39,815 --> 02:22:41,416
-Sorry.
-Why is it hard for you to understand?

2507
02:22:41,784 --> 02:22:43,729
It's not a convoy of a local minister...

2508
02:22:44,056 --> 02:22:45,033
it's the Central Minister.

2509
02:22:45,286 --> 02:22:47,392
If I screw up,
I'll be presented with memos all my life.

2510
02:22:47,479 --> 02:22:47,975
I'm really sorry.

2511
02:22:48,088 --> 02:22:49,757
Please understand and step back.

[Praised Sloganeering]

2513
02:23:04,273 --> 02:23:05,155
Hey, woman...

2514
02:23:05,981 --> 02:23:07,332
where are you going?
Stop right there.

2515
02:23:08,082 --> 02:23:09,292
You shouldn't be here.

2516
02:23:09,512 --> 02:23:11,522
Please listen, don't go out there.

2517
02:23:12,387 --> 02:23:13,137
Stop right there.

2518
02:23:14,434 --> 02:23:14,947
Hey!

2519
02:24:03,469 --> 02:24:05,717
I won't leave without meeting the minister.

2520
02:24:06,283 --> 02:24:07,048
Let go of me.

2521
02:24:18,573 --> 02:24:20,378
Let her go. Don't rough her up.

2522
02:24:20,480 --> 02:24:21,599
Come on, step back.

2523
02:24:21,917 --> 02:24:24,263
Leave her. I said, let go of her.

2524
02:24:24,904 --> 02:24:26,404
What happened?
What seems to be the problem?

2525
02:24:26,567 --> 02:24:29,941
What is so trivial that you had to jump
in front of my car?

2526
02:24:30,176 --> 02:24:31,879
Where are you from?
And which group you belong to?

2527
02:24:32,200 --> 02:24:34,200
Does this have something to do
with any protest?

2528
02:24:36,099 --> 02:24:38,412
Please write down your woes
and file a petition.

2529
02:24:38,685 --> 02:24:40,825
I'll do what ever I could
to sort the issue.

2530
02:24:42,480 --> 02:24:43,621
What is your demand?

2531
02:24:44,136 --> 02:24:45,457
I want my husband back.

2532
02:24:45,919 --> 02:24:46,832
I didn't get you.

2533
02:24:47,302 --> 02:24:48,786
I don't understand.

2534
02:24:49,161 --> 02:24:51,473
Since four years her husband has been
working in Dubai.

2535
02:24:51,653 --> 02:24:54,402
Unfortunately ten months ago,
he died in an accident on the job.

2536
02:24:54,771 --> 02:24:57,371
We tried everything to bring
his body back.

2537
02:24:57,474 --> 02:25:00,185
Ariyanachi has filed petitions
in every possible office.

2538
02:25:00,513 --> 02:25:02,864
When we tried meeting
the Chief Minister in person...

2539
02:25:02,975 --> 02:25:05,576
we tried our best. But we couldn't...

2540
02:25:05,725 --> 02:25:06,928
that's why she had to take this step.

2541
02:25:08,193 --> 02:25:09,021
I'm so sorry.

2542
02:25:10,037 --> 02:25:10,732
One second.

2543
02:25:11,286 --> 02:25:13,052
Officers, send everybody back.

2544
02:25:13,241 --> 02:25:14,170
Everyone fall back.

2545
02:25:14,413 --> 02:25:15,342
Send everybody back.

2546
02:25:15,404 --> 02:25:17,576
Ask everyone to fall back. Go back.

2547
02:25:17,779 --> 02:25:19,037
I want to speak to them in private.

2548
02:25:19,162 --> 02:25:20,162
-Go back!
-Everyone move.

2549
02:25:20,295 --> 02:25:21,467
-Come on, leave.
-Don't crowd over here.

2550
02:25:21,663 --> 02:25:22,631
Ask them to move to the other side.

2551
02:25:22,818 --> 02:25:24,551
I respect your emotions.

2552
02:25:24,685 --> 02:25:26,544
But, I'm a Defense Minister.

2553
02:25:26,654 --> 02:25:28,380
Deputy Defense Minister.

2554
02:25:28,896 --> 02:25:30,537
Your grievance falls under
different ministry.

2555
02:25:32,200 --> 02:25:38,154
So, you want me to find who's that and jump
in front of their car instead of yours?

2556
02:25:38,287 --> 02:25:40,380
Nachi, don't be so rude.

2557
02:25:40,639 --> 02:25:41,498
Sir, it's fine.

2558
02:25:43,037 --> 02:25:44,888
Poor thing, she has gone through a lot.

2559
02:25:46,247 --> 02:25:51,114
Even if I come forward to help,
the concerned department...

2560
02:25:51,302 --> 02:25:54,123
will obey only if the minister
of their department approves it.

2561
02:25:54,874 --> 02:25:57,427
Anyways I'll try to solve your problem.

2562
02:25:58,326 --> 02:25:59,622
In whichever way I could.

2563
02:25:59,968 --> 02:26:00,507
Okay?

2564
02:26:02,268 --> 02:26:03,451
-Officer!
-Madam.

2565
02:26:03,513 --> 02:26:05,293
No action should be taken against her.

2566
02:26:05,615 --> 02:26:07,528
No inquires. No follow ups.

2567
02:26:07,842 --> 02:26:09,443
-Did you understand?
-Madam, but she...

2568
02:26:09,654 --> 02:26:10,224
Please!

2569
02:26:10,935 --> 02:26:15,027
She's gone through hell and has come down
to bring back her husband.

2570
02:26:15,552 --> 02:26:18,271
I don't have the right solution
to her problem.

2571
02:26:18,645 --> 02:26:20,199
But I believe in conscience.

2572
02:26:20,990 --> 02:26:24,490
Don't enforce your power
on the common people.

2573
02:26:24,739 --> 02:26:25,317
Go!

2574
02:26:26,006 --> 02:26:26,481
Okay, madam.

2575
02:26:26,505 --> 02:26:27,502
-Joseph!
-Yes, madam.

2576
02:26:27,621 --> 02:26:28,091
Phone!

2577
02:26:29,404 --> 02:26:32,482
-Give her your number and note down hers.
-Okay, ma'am.

2578
02:26:33,192 --> 02:26:33,645
Come closer.

2579
02:26:39,390 --> 02:26:40,733
What is your husband's name?

2580
02:26:41,748 --> 02:26:43,131
Ma'am, it's Ranasingam.

2581
02:26:43,725 --> 02:26:45,295
Okay. Ranasingam.

2582
02:26:46,694 --> 02:26:51,193
I'm going to address this issue by
tagging the concern minister in the tweet.

2583
02:26:51,795 --> 02:26:53,802
Definitely, it's going to be viral.

2584
02:26:57,233 --> 02:26:58,443
Swami, switch on the projector.

2585
02:27:00,699 --> 02:27:02,597
[News] A woman from
Ramanathapuram district...

2586
02:27:02,771 --> 02:27:04,716
Sir, these people never change.

2587
02:27:05,217 --> 02:27:08,122
When she created a ruckus,
we should've got her arrested.

2588
02:27:08,482 --> 02:27:10,607
Or at least we should've
got her convicted in the court.

2589
02:27:11,499 --> 02:27:15,061
Nowadays, us collectors and ministers
have become a joke to them.

2590
02:27:15,592 --> 02:27:17,654
Swami, I never asked for your opinion.

2591
02:27:18,090 --> 02:27:22,223
The Collectors, Officers and Ministers
are humans too.

2592
02:27:22,887 --> 02:27:23,574
They're not gods.

2593
02:27:23,667 --> 02:27:24,848
In your purview...

2594
02:27:24,925 --> 02:27:28,888
you expect us to go personally
and bring back her husband's body.

2595
02:27:29,015 --> 02:27:30,792
Swami, can you stop with
ridiculous comments.

2596
02:27:31,879 --> 02:27:32,480
Sorry, sir.

2597
02:27:32,800 --> 02:27:36,974
Unofficially we could've pointed her
in the right direction.

2598
02:27:39,217 --> 02:27:40,442
That's not our duty.

2599
02:27:40,644 --> 02:27:42,776
Defense Minister's tweet on the girl...

2600
02:27:43,028 --> 02:27:44,074
it's not her duty as well.

2601
02:27:47,175 --> 02:27:48,223
Sir, what shall we do now?

2602
02:27:51,239 --> 02:27:53,255
[News] A woman from Ramanathapuram...

2603
02:27:53,310 --> 02:27:56,036
tried committing suicide by jumping
in front of Central Minister's car

2604
02:27:56,207 --> 02:27:59,097
Here's the conversation that happened
between them.

2605
02:27:59,317 --> 02:28:02,722
Today, when the Central Defense Minster
came to Chennai...

2606
02:28:02,911 --> 02:28:07,402
a woman jumped in front of the
security vehicle that created a chaos.

2607
02:28:07,581 --> 02:28:11,807
We learn that, she was looking to
bring back her dead husband from Dubai.

2608
02:28:12,044 --> 02:28:15,512
The Central Minister took a picture
with her shared it on twitter.

2609
02:28:15,731 --> 02:28:17,731
That picture has gone viral
on the social media.

2610
02:28:20,597 --> 02:28:22,658
[NEWS] Recently deceased Sridevi's body...

2611
02:28:22,853 --> 02:28:25,735
arrived at Mumbai after 72 hours
from Dubai.

2612
02:28:25,911 --> 02:28:29,619
We'll check more details pertaining to it
from our reporter, Padmapriya.

2613
02:28:29,728 --> 02:28:30,728
Tell us, Padmapriya.

2614
02:28:30,869 --> 02:28:35,478
Any idea where have they planned
to keep the body for tonight?

2615
02:28:35,737 --> 02:28:37,978
VIP's, Politicians of major parties

2616
02:28:38,125 --> 02:28:40,789
and film celebrities,
who all are going to attend the funeral?

2617
02:28:40,861 --> 02:28:43,111
What arrangements are made for safety?

2618
02:28:43,292 --> 02:28:45,447
Can you please enlighten us
with more information on this matter?

2619
02:28:47,485 --> 02:28:49,929
Nachi, why are you getting drenched
in the rain?

2620
02:28:54,222 --> 02:28:55,088
Did you watch the news?

2621
02:29:02,556 --> 02:29:03,532
What do we do now?

2622
02:29:06,081 --> 02:29:07,901
I'm going to meet that Minister in person.

2623
02:29:08,291 --> 02:29:09,599
Are you talking about the
Foreign Minister?

2624
02:29:11,359 --> 02:29:12,325
Are you going to Delhi?

2625
02:29:12,899 --> 02:29:14,437
What makes you think
he'll be in Delhi?

2626
02:29:15,079 --> 02:29:16,509
They keep traveling the world.

2627
02:29:16,667 --> 02:29:18,596
It's not advisable to go there alone
with a child.

2628
02:29:19,487 --> 02:29:22,143
Please listen to what I have to say.
We'll ask your father to come down.

2629
02:29:22,486 --> 02:29:24,244
We'll take a decision after discussing
it with him.

2630
02:29:25,510 --> 02:29:26,252
Please be patient.

2631
02:29:27,095 --> 02:29:30,291
It's been ten months,
since I saw my husband Ranasingam's face.

2632
02:29:30,901 --> 02:29:31,831
I understand your concern.

2633
02:29:32,618 --> 02:29:35,203
But decisions taken in haste
will have consequences.

2634
02:29:36,776 --> 02:29:37,588
Please understand.

2635
02:29:38,398 --> 02:29:41,318
Moreover, you traveling alone to Delhi...

2636
02:29:45,240 --> 02:29:50,998
The consequences will remain the same
regardless of the company.

2637
02:29:54,715 --> 02:29:57,058
People who are at the pinnacle
of authority...

2638
02:29:57,801 --> 02:30:02,269
should realize our undiluted pain
and hardship, Sekar.

2639
02:30:41,817 --> 02:30:43,238
Sir, I'm here to file a petition.

2640
02:30:43,911 --> 02:30:46,746
Sir, I'm here just to meet the Prime Minister
and hand over my petition.

2641
02:31:20,520 --> 02:31:21,325
Just one minute.

2642
02:31:24,723 --> 02:31:25,543
Ariyanachi?

2643
02:31:29,074 --> 02:31:30,278
What are you doing over here?

2644
02:31:30,349 --> 02:31:32,106
I'm here to meet the Foreign Minister.

2645
02:31:32,511 --> 02:31:33,574
He's not available at the moment.

2646
02:31:33,758 --> 02:31:34,995
He's visiting his home-state
at the moment.

2647
02:31:35,151 --> 02:31:39,079
Did Defense Minister's tweet
helped you in anyway?

2648
02:31:40,700 --> 02:31:41,957
Do you know anyone from the Parliament?

2649
02:31:44,589 --> 02:31:45,201
What about Delhi?

2650
02:31:48,881 --> 02:31:54,107
Actually, International Tourist Day
is being held at Qutub Minar, tomorrow.

2651
02:31:54,631 --> 02:31:56,716
Central Minister is definitely attending
that event.

2652
02:31:57,418 --> 02:32:01,428
I'll try my best and make sure
that you meet the Central Minister.

2653
02:32:01,636 --> 02:32:04,355
It's fine, please don't bother yourself
with it.

2654
02:32:05,052 --> 02:32:05,832
I'll handle it myself.

2655
02:32:05,980 --> 02:32:08,309
Ariyanachi, I have no qualms
in helping you.

2656
02:32:08,677 --> 02:32:11,098
Do you see this Ministry building?

2657
02:32:11,355 --> 02:32:12,901
The huge gates erected in front of it...

2658
02:32:13,176 --> 02:32:15,402
are only to intimidate the people.

2659
02:32:15,754 --> 02:32:17,254
Honesty can't get through these gates.

2660
02:32:17,519 --> 02:32:20,737
Trust me, you can't meet
any member of the Parliament.

2661
02:32:21,034 --> 02:32:23,425
If you want to meet the minister
and get your work done...

2662
02:32:23,738 --> 02:32:24,964
there's another option to it.

2663
02:32:25,682 --> 02:32:26,730
Come on, let's go.

2664
02:32:33,989 --> 02:32:35,129
Sorry, Ariyanachi.

2665
02:32:36,270 --> 02:32:37,944
Due to Delhi Pollution issue...

2666
02:32:38,155 --> 02:32:42,710
Minister’s plan to visit International Tourist day
has been canceled.

2667
02:33:09,841 --> 02:33:13,231
Despite voicing out the truth,
it gets lost in the crowd.

2668
02:33:13,559 --> 02:33:16,199
If you think truth was lost,
I wouldn't have noticed you.

2669
02:33:17,537 --> 02:33:18,458
Just like you mentioned...

2670
02:33:19,208 --> 02:33:22,309
someone will have the tendency
to notice the truth.

2671
02:33:22,675 --> 02:33:23,832
And they'll come forward
and support us.

2672
02:33:25,091 --> 02:33:27,020
Your voice will be heard.

2673
02:33:27,794 --> 02:33:28,661
Trust me on this.

2674

2675
02:34:04,763 --> 02:34:07,358

2676

-Hey woman!
-Sir, don't come closer.

2677
02:34:10,615 --> 02:34:11,960
-Listen...
-She'll jump off the bridge.

2678
02:34:12,045 --> 02:34:12,857
you don't have the permission--

2679
02:34:12,882 --> 02:34:13,826
She's not bluffing, she'll jump.

2680
02:34:13,898 --> 02:34:16,101
I'm telling the truth.
She'll definitely jump.

2681
02:34:16,289 --> 02:34:18,125
The news is going live.

2682
02:34:18,288 --> 02:34:19,119

Ladies, you're not supposed to
go over there.

2858
02:48:15,471 --> 02:48:17,251
Ariyanachi, please stop.

2859
02:48:17,276 --> 02:48:18,361
You shouldn't go beyond this point.

2860
02:48:18,525 --> 02:48:19,415
Please, don't go.

2861
02:48:20,212 --> 02:48:21,869
Please hear me out.

2862
02:48:22,025 --> 02:48:22,970
You're not supposed to go out there.

2863
02:48:23,104 --> 02:48:24,533
Ladies, please don't go over there.

2864
02:48:53,479 --> 02:48:55,518
The body was preserved in chemicals
for ten months.

2865
02:48:55,635 --> 02:48:56,783
Please cover your faces.

2866
02:48:58,266 --> 02:49:01,079
-Hey, get me a crowbar.
-Oh, god, no!

2867
02:49:01,454 --> 02:49:02,697
My mighty lion is no more!

2868
02:49:23,033 --> 02:49:24,884
My dear son!

2869
02:49:30,831 --> 02:49:32,120
Be careful.

2870
02:49:32,480 --> 02:49:34,065
He was boxed in for months.

2871
02:49:50,112 --> 02:49:51,846
Bloody sinners!

2872
02:49:52,730 --> 02:49:54,207
He returned as a corpse.

2873
02:50:07,512 --> 02:50:09,213
My dear son.

2874
02:50:20,330 --> 02:50:23,189
He went to make money,
but returned a corpse.

2875
02:50:24,734 --> 02:50:27,899
My daughter's life is ruined!

2876
02:50:29,512 --> 02:50:31,722
Keep this coin on Ranasingam's hand.

2877
02:50:32,353 --> 02:50:33,985
Then ask Ariyanachi to take it from him.

2878
02:50:34,393 --> 02:50:36,744
Come on, dear. Come on, please do it.

2879
02:50:36,839 --> 02:50:38,470
Let's get this over with.

2880
02:50:38,810 --> 02:50:41,248
Ranasingam, your wife has come to meet you.

2881
02:50:41,394 --> 02:50:43,105
Dear, please take the coin from him.

2882
02:50:43,573 --> 02:50:44,605
Please take it from him.

2883
02:50:46,071 --> 02:50:47,501
I'm not able to do it.

2884
02:50:47,589 --> 02:50:48,878
Dear, please take it.

2885
02:51:44,891 --> 02:51:47,500
They're asking for the wedding chain, dear.

2886
02:51:49,969 --> 02:51:53,398
Please give it to them.

2887
02:52:13,370 --> 02:52:14,839
My dearest, son.

2888
02:52:17,971 --> 02:52:19,690
Rightfully, you should be performing
my last rites.

2889
02:52:20,902 --> 02:52:22,878
Sadly, I'm performing your last rites.

2890
02:52:31,291 --> 02:52:34,322
As a brother,
I tried everything I could.

2891
02:52:35,159 --> 02:52:36,682
But as a Collector,
this is the best I could do.

2892
02:52:38,290 --> 02:52:40,366
If you need anything,
please don't hesitate to ask.

2893
02:52:52,882 --> 02:52:55,265
Please don't cremate my son.

2894
02:54:02,234 --> 02:54:04,328
You gave a stranger's dead body...

2895
02:54:05,220 --> 02:54:09,672
and got rid of your duty,
you fucking bastards.

2896
02:54:47,077 --> 02:54:49,358
Please forgive me, honey!

2897
02:55:55,139 --> 02:56:00,144
This is what we found out.
We had no other evidence.

2898
02:56:00,450 --> 02:56:02,308
I have nothing else to say
to these sinners!

2899
02:56:15,317 --> 02:56:19,127
[News] An order has been passed to bring
the body back immediately.

2900
02:56:19,231 --> 02:56:24,207
I literally begged them to speak to
my son for one last time.
