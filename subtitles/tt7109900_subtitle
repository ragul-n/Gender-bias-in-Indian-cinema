00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,710
Hello...

2
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,080
Is your father home?

3
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,120
Yes, he is.

4
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,040
Dad....

5
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,290
Dad....

6
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,870
What's it my dear?

7
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,710
Inspector Muthanna speaking

8
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:37,460
Sir, a murder has been reported at
the Archaeology department

9
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,330
How does your day usually begin?

10
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:35,080
Since I'm a cop, my lifestyle is very disciplined.

11
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,160
I wake up by 6 AM.

12
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,250
By 6.30, I finish my jogging and workout,

13
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,830
at 7:30 I have my breakfast.

14
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,460
By 8.30, I am at the station.

15
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,580
As an inspector, you will have a gun right?

16
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,750
No. The traffic police are not given guns.

17
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,080
Why?

18
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,210
What a question?!

19
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,210
Can we shoot somebody cause
they don't have a license.

20
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:58,290
-Why do we need a gun?
-Not having a driving license is ok.

21
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:01,580
These idiots who ride on the footpath,
do wheelies and stunts,

22
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,830
They need their asses whipped!

23
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,410
Isn't that why god created piles?

24
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,460
-Is that a joke??
-No. I'm serious.

25
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,580
So you've never had a girlfriend?

26
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:12,830
No

27
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:13,960
Nice

28
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,910
How long have you been a police officer?

29
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,910
Three years.

30
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,460
So what if it's been three years?

31
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,750
Sir, last year you'd promised to transfer
me to the crime department.

32
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,290
Sir please....

33
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,160
Sir, I'm ok with a posting
in any corner of the state.

34
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:34,000
I've been working very sincerely until now.

35
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,710
I've set records for cases solved.

36
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,830
-Shyam, I can't do anything now.
-Sir, but...

37
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,330
Don't waste your time complaining.

38
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,160
It'll become more difficult for you.

39
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:43,710
What's the score?

40
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,460
I won.

41
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,960
You have to treat me now.

42
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,660
Ok, I will treat you to ice-cream.

43
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,290
Ok

44
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,500
Do you have any hobbies...?

45
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,660
I'm fond of playing chess.

46
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,870
And the camel eats your pawn.

47
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,580
I lose track of time when I come here.

48
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,830
-I hope the kids didn't trouble you
-Not at all.

49
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:08,460
Please use this money to buy books
and other things for the kids

50
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,290
Bye.

51
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,370
Bye.

52
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,410
-It was nice to see you.
-Yeah.

53
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,080
-All the best.
-Thanks.

54
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:22,710
Tell me mom...

55
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,330
How did it go? Did you like her?

56
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,620
The same old story.

57
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,000
She's not comfortable marrying a police man.

58
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,330
Oh god! Forget her.

59
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,370
Whatever happens, happens for good.

60
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,750
Don't worry.

61
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:39,120
Tell him that it takes time to find a good match.

62
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:43,790
I've told you to go offer prayers
at the Hanuman temple regularly.

63
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:44,870
All will be well...

64
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,330
-...You'll find a nice girl.
-Ma, I've to get to work.

65
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,910
Play right here, Don't wander off.

66
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,330
Crossroads

67
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:47,000
Give me a pen

68
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,000
Madam....

69
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:16,410
Tell those media people to
move towards the corner.

70
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,160
You both stay here until the
forensic samples are collected.

71
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:34,500
All details are sent.
We cant have issues like last time.

72
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,160
And that's our responsibility.

73
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:42,580
Deploy the STF to sensitive polling booths.

74
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,330
Tell me.

75
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:47,120
Sir, there's a metro construction at NBT Junction right?

76
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,370
They've founds bones there.

77
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,040
So?

78
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,080
The forensic team is here.

79
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:54,540
So what??

80
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,500
Sir, can I please join the investigation?

81
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,710
Stop wasting my time!

82
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:01,830
Go do your job.

83
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,620
Send those people away.

84
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,540
We've found three sets of bones.

85
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,120
Its too early to say if a crime has been committed here.

86
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,750
I'll update you if we get more details.

87
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,960
Mind your step.

88
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,210
Sir.

89
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,540
You asked for me?

90
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,370
What are you doing here?

91
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,290
-They found bones here..
-So what?

92
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,540
Its no big deal that
some bones have been found.

93
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,500
There's a lot of traffic. Take care of it.

94
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,620
Yes sir.

95
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,660
We've found three sets of bones.

96
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,290
Its too early to say if a crime has been committed here.

97
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:50,040
Its no big deal that
some bones have been found.

98
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,790
There's a lot of traffic. Take care of it.

99
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,330
I'll call you back.

100
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,290
Hey you! Who is that?

101
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:22,660
Hey mister! Hello! Yes, you...

102
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,080
What are you doing there?

103
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:25,960
Who are you?

104
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,620
Who am I??

105
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,250
If i kick your ass and throw you in jail...

106
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,870
You'll know who I am.

107
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,710
Press. I'm a reporter.

108
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,660
Come up now!

109
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,000
Give me your hand, sir.

110
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:43,160
Do you have any sense?
What are you doing at a crime scene?

111
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,000
Which press? Give me your ID card.

112
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,830
Lock Up News.

113
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,460
Give me your ID...

114
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:51,750
...Else I'll make news of you being locked up.

115
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,250
Lock Up News editor, Kumar.

116
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,620
What are you doing here?

117
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,750
Apparently they found some bones here..

118
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,870
I'd come to check if it can be a good story.

119
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,040
At this time?

120
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,620
We reporters are always on duty.

121
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,000
-We work 24 hours.
-You poor thing.

122
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,000
You're mocking me?

123
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,460
Give back my card.

124
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,790
I will. I will.

125
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:18,710
Come to the station tomorrow morning.

126
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,120
-Please give back.
-Collect it tomorrow.

127
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:22,460
Please return my card, sir.

128
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:23,160
Sir!

129
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,540
Sir, please wait a second.

130
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,000
I looked all over for you in the other station.

131
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,290
The way you spoke last night,

132
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:30,790
I thought you were a new cop
with the Crime Branch.

133
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,160
Had I known you're a Traffic cop....

134
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,160
Why?

135
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,290
Traffic cops are not part of the police?

136
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,750
They are! But they are different.

137
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:47,330
Your uniform isn't khaki, so...
Never mind, give back my card.

138
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,370
No, I wont.

139
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,870
Fine. Keep it.

140
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,290
Don't forget to read the news tomorrow.

141
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:07,960
TRAFFIC COPS TO INVESTIGATE CRIME??

142
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:17,710
Summon that Shyam
from Yeshwantpur station.

143
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,460
Sir!

144
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:27,710
Sit down.

145
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,580
Look at that newspaper.

146
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,830
It's election season.

147
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,250
You're lucky...

148
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,120
That its a rubbish newspaper that nobody reads.

149
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:51,830
If this was any other paper,
the outcome would be different.

150
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,660
-What did I tell you over the phone?
-He wrote this just to....

151
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,750
Why did you go there?

152
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,540
Didn't I warn you already?

153
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,330
Idiot!

154
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,250
I'm sorry sir. But...

155
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,160
This is a dead-end case.

156
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,120
These bones are not important.

157
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,040
The city has enough problems.

158
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:12,960
This is your last warning

159
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:14,370
Go back to your job.

160
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:16,660
Ok sir.

161
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,330
Sir, please listen to me..

162
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,660
Sir no Sir..please...

163
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,040
F****, You said you'll return the money last month.

164
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,040
B******! Are you trying to fool us?

165
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:57,410
Sir, give me one more week,
I'll definitely return it.

166
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,330
Boss, he said the same thing last week also.

167
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,330
No sir, I will. I swear on God.

168
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,120
This time I've broken your fingers.

169
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:15,960
Next time, I wont spare you.
You have 10 days.

170
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,460
Let's go.

171
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,910
Who were the guys that beat you?

172
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,870
Local boys from my neighborhood sir.

173
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,040
I have made a lot of bad loans.

174
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:50,580
There are no readers for my newspaper.

175
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,960
As I cover only uncomfortable and bitter news.

176
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,040
My paper should've attained great heights. But...

177
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,790
(mutters to himself).

178
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,460
There was this B*****D sir.

179
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,460
I got caught in his web.

180
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,620
He betrayed me.

181
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,460
Since then my life has been miserable.

182
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:25,830
When I think of about my life,
I feel like going and jumping into that pit!

183
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,080
What a pathetic life!

184
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,250
I heard they're closing the case involving those bones.

185
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,540
How did you find out?

186
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:47,040
I've been seeing your department from
close quarters for many years now.

187
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:52,660
Your boss, Siddalingaiah
hasn't risen in ranks owing to his devotion.

188
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,870
You know whose sister he has married?

189
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,250
That's all!

190
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,040
He is a tiger outside home but a mouse at home!

191
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,500
The wife decides everything.

192
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:08,660
Sir, sorry but can you fix my drink?

193
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,080
That's enough sir.

194
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:16,620
Sir, stop for a minute.

195
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,870
Yes right here.

196
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,370
Careful. Slowly.

197
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:28,160
What is it? What are you staring at?

198
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,250
I know you have become a big man now.

199
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,080
To hell with you!!

200
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,750
You are going to cleanse our society, huh?

201
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:49,000
You filthy pig! You can use all the make up in the world
A pig will always be a pig.

202
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:53,040
Dont forget, I'm know who you are.

203
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,370
Even if you forget, I won't.

204
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,160
-I'll teach you a lesson
-Kumar.

205
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,960
-Leave me sir. I'll show them.
-Kumar, lets go.

206
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,620
-Come Kumar
-You don't know these guys sir.

207
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:08,540
-These guys were on the footpath sir.
-Ok, ok. I'll drop you home. Come.

208
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,370
I'm coming. Wait.

209
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,460
-This is the case file? The forensic reports?
-Yes. It's all there.

210
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:25,460
According to the carbon dating reports,

211
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,710
these are the remains of a man
aged between 30 to 32 years of age.

212
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,960
These are of a woman aged between 28 to 29 years.

213
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:39,250
This is of a girl aged between 8 to 10 years.

214
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:42,910
Since the girl was very young
her bones have disintegrated.

215
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:49,000
Initially, we were unable to decipher
if this was a regular death or a murder.

216
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:53,290
But the way the bones are broken,
Its rather unusual.

217
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:58,910
There are chances for the bones
to break this way during burials.

218
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,620
But looking at the other samples we collected,
I don't think this is a natural death

219
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,410
Look, here are the samples collected by them.

220
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:17,960
If they've been buried, then why would we find these?

221
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:20,870
(mutters to himself).

222
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:30,040
How long back were these bodies buried?

223
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:35,500
As per my tests, they were buried about 40 years ago.

224
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,460
What will happen to the bones now?

225
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,710
The government buries them.

226
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:46,330
You've buried all three skeletons in one grave?

227
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,120
Government allots money for only one grave, sir.

228
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,750
My work's done sir.

229
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:56,290
-Do you have their names for the gravestone?
-No

230
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:57,870
Ok, I'll leave sir.

231
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:08,120
Do you have their names for the gravestone?

232
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:10,000
Sir...

233
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:11,960
Sir...

234
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,290
What are you thinking?

235
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:14,790
Those bones, Rangappa.

236
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,790
Something is not right about it.

237
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,330
That isn't surprising sir.

238
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:22,040
Long back, there used to be a lake here.
Many corpses have been dumped there.

239
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,750
This isn't the first.
They've found bones earlier, too.

240
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,960
-How many years ago was that?
-Sir...

241
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:32,160
People offer special prayers to god
hoping to get a posting in traffic...

242
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:34,080
Rangappa, how many years ago was that!!

243
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,710
Around 1975-80 sir.

244
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,790
The city developed rapidly after that.

245
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,620
Where will I find those old case files?

246
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,290
I'm letting you in because of Rangappa.

247
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:58,330
All the unsolved missing and absconding cases
of the time period you mentioned are here.

248
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,830
-Take a look.
-Thanks, Manju.

249
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:35,830
Am I on a mysterious journey...

250
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:42,080
...Into a story buried by time.

251
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:58,160
Am I on a mysterious journey...

252
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:05,040
with a hazy beginning and a hazy end?

253
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:11,120
The bruised half truths
and half lies in these stories...

254
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,450
...Have left behind deep scars.

255
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,580
Scars that bear those deep clues.

256
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:24,410
Is the truth hiding in plain sight?
or is it an illusion waiting to fall apart?

257
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:28,330
Who claims responsibility for this??

258
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,540
To solve each chapter...

259
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,200
...Shadows turn into witnesses...

260
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:38,290
Riddled by thoughts,
my instincts are melting away.

261
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:41,410
Hidden somewhere between the beginning and the end...

262
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:44,620
...Is a lie, masquerading as the light..

263
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:49,700
...Leading me in this journey...

264
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:58,700
Am I on a mysterious journey...

265
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:05,000
...Into a story buried by time.

266
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:07,500
Sir!

267
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:08,540
Sir!

268
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:09,750
Sir!

269
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,120
-Tea for you.
-Ok.

270
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,580
Have I lost my way here?

271
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:55,830
Is my shadow playing tricks on me?

272
00:23:55,950 --> 00:24:01,580
The river of doubts merges into a
sea of speculations...

273
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:05,040
Have I lost my way here?

274
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:08,120
Is my shadow playing tricks on me?

275
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:14,790
The river of doubts merges into a
sea of speculations...

276
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:23,330
It was a dark moment in India's history.

277
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:27,450
The emergency sparked the entry of....

278
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:31,450
Criminals and Goons into politics...

279
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,120
This is Gurudas Naidu.

280
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:39,790
Bangalore Division head of the
Indian Archaeological department.

281
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,830
This is his wife Vijayalakshmi Naidu

282
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,500
This is Vaidehi Naidu aged 10 years.

283
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,330
Investigating officer for this case was Muthanna.

284
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,000
Who is this Muthanna?

285
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,620
By when will Kumar return?

286
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,080
Any minute now.

287
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:11,750
What work do you have with him?

288
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,200
How much has he borrowed from you? I'll pay you back.

289
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:24,250
No No. I had some work with him, Relax.

290
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:25,950
What does he think of himself?

291
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:29,370
Priya, don't buy anything
at Venkatesh's shop from today.

292
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:31,950
Why? What happened to the money
that I'd given you.

293
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,080
What do you mean? It got spent elsewhere!

294
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,700
Oh hello sir!

295
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,540
When did you come? Give me a cup of coffee...

296
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,160
What's the matter?

297
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:48,790
There was an inspector called
Muthanna at the Cubbon Park station.

298
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,040
Do you have any information about him?

299
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,410
This is related to those bones in the pit, right?

300
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,910
What do you know about Muthanna?

301
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,410
You know my situation.

302
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,910
Only if you tell me about the case...

303
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,290
...I'll find out whatever you want about Muthanna.

304
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:10,790
Never mind. I'll leave.

305
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:16,200
I dont know who this Muthanna is...

306
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:23,120
But his investigation could reveal how
Naidu and his family ended up dead in the ground

307
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,370
The morning of February 25,

308
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:35,000
a complaint about the murder and robbery was
lodged at the Archaeological Department.

309
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,830
Murder victim: Suresh. Age: 32.

310
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:46,830
The first step of the investigation was
to find out what was stolen.

311
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,040
Hello.

312
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:55,700
Yes, my name is K Ganapathy.

313
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,870
Excavation officer. Naidu's higher officer.

314
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,950
He works at the Hyderabad office.

315
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,040
During an excavation at Hampi
treasures from the Vijayanagar empire were found.

316
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:12,750
On testing, we found jewelry
worth around 80-90 lakhs Rupees.

317
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,290
Ten days back...

318
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:17,200
I had ordered Naidu to move the treasure to Hyderabad.

319
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:22,000
He said the political situation is unstable,
and will be do it once time is right.

320
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:26,580
The body of Suresh was first discovered
by office peon Sebastian.

321
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,750
I’ve been working for Naidu Sir,
for 10 years now.

322
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,910
I'm at office by 8 AM. That day was no different.

323
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:47,120
A dead body! Dead body! Dead body!

324
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,500
I couldn't bear to look at it.

325
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,040
That blood. It still gives me nightmares sir.

326
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:59,080
A sharp weapon was used to murder Suresh.

327
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,580
A knife was missing from the same office.

328
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,200
Why was only Suresh targeted?

329
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:08,040
My name is Surendra Nayak.

330
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:13,040
I've been working in the Archaeological Department
for the past 15 years.

331
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:16,580
Only Suresh had access to the keys of the treasury.

332
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:24,120
Suresh was responsible for the goods
after the testing process.

333
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:31,000
A car was found near Rayagudda railway station,
45 km from Bengaluru.

334
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:44,160
We found that it belonged to
Gurudas Naidu of the Archaeology Department.

335
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:47,120
But there was no trace of Gurudas Naidu.

336
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:52,540
This car was an important evidence
in this investigation.

337
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:58,080
The murder weapon thst was missing
from the office was found in the burnt car.

338
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,750
Since Naidu was nowhere to be found,
We questioned his servants.

339
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:07,790
Chikamma, the cook who worked for Naidu's family.

340
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,950
I have been working for Naidu since 5 years.

341
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:16,450
I used to serve coffee to Mr. Naidu every morning at 6 AM.

342
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,950
Sir, your coffee.

343
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:28,410
An hour later, I saw that the room door was still closed.

344
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,290
The coffee remained untouched.

345
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:34,120
I thought I'd check with Bablu
if he knew where Mr Naidu was.

346
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,290
My name is Bablu.

347
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:41,000
Chikkamma got me a job at Naidu's house four years ago.

348
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:49,620
Sir! Kumar here.

349
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,290
Yes Kumar, tell me.

350
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:53,750
I'm also investigating this case sir...

351
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:56,330
I'll share all the information with you...

352
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,330
Sharing the story is up to you...

353
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,870
But I’ll help you find Muthanna.

354
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,040
Thanks.

355
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,870
-Bablu!
-Coming!

356
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,040
Bablu!

357
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,950
The door was locked from outside.

358
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,750
Yes, the door was locked from outside.

359
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:20,910
What is it?

360
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:22,790
Isn't Mr Naidu at home?

361
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:27,250
We had to open the door to
Naidu's room as there was no response from inside...

362
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:29,830
There were no clothes in the cupboard.

363
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,700
We thought they left due to an emergency
and got back to our jobs.

364
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,950
Madam had called me the previous night.

365
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,120
-Babloo!
-Coming.

366
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:44,450
Sir will be late today. You go sleep.

367
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:48,250
Also get the suitcase here, I’ve got pack a few things.

368
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:49,910
Okay.

369
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:57,080
Was the timing of Naidu's family leaving the city
right after the crime....

370
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,040
...A coincidence or was that their actual plan?

371
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:07,660
Investigation was done to find the reason for Naidu's travel.

372
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,950
My Name is Chalapathy,

373
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,160
Naidu and family were my neighbours.

374
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:18,000
Ten days ago, Naidu withdrew all his money
from our bank and closed his account

375
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:22,330
Eerappa, the gardener at Naidu's home.

376
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,950
What were you doing the previous night?

377
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,790
The previous night Sebastian came to Naidu’s house.

378
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,250
But I left at 9 PM that day.

379
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:42,410
Yes, He left by 9 PM that day.

380
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:46,540
After that I got very drunk.

381
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:49,700
The door was locked from outside.

382
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:53,120
Sir, I forgot to tell one thing.

383
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:55,910
That evening Mr Naidu summoned me to his chamber.

384
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,250
-Sebastian!
-Sir.

385
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:01,660
Section 144 has been announced.
Get back home immediately.

386
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:06,410
Mr Naidu sent all of us home early that day...

387
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:13,250
...I thought it was because of the big strike
being carried out by the mill workers union near by.

388
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,620
My name is Fernandes.

389
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,250
I’ve been Mr Naidu's driver for 5 years now.

390
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,660
But I didn’t drive the car that day...

391
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:26,040
I think everybody except Mr Naidu and Suresh had left.

392
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,620
Mr Naidu called me.

393
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,750
-Fernandes!
-Coming sir!

394
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:32,200
It’ll take sometime today. You leave.

395
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,040
It’s okay Sir, I’ll wait.

396
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:37,330
-No! Leave. I’ll come later.
-Okay Sir!

397
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:41,080
The riots were getting bad so I went home

398
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:45,700
Security guard at Naidu’s house - Mohan Swamy.

399
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,000
That night Mr Naidu's car arrived.

400
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:53,500
Yes, Mr Naidu was driving instead of Fernandes.

401
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,410
As the car passed by me, I noticed...

402
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,750
...Mr Naidu's coat had blood stains.

403
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:13,870
I went to check if all was ok
but Mr Naidu went in and shut the door.

404
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,250
I didn’t want to interfere.
So I went back to work.

405
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,120
It was all quiet inside.

406
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:26,620
One hour later, the porch light flickered on and off.

407
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,830
Then there was only darkness.

408
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:31,500
I went to check...

409
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:35,330
Sir! Sir!

410
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:43,410
I don’t know who hit me sir.
This is all I remember...

411
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:47,200
I think Mr Naidu had a partner...

412
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:52,290
This person along with Mr and Mrs Naidu
planned this whole crime.

413
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:55,200
Based on the evidence collected...

414
00:33:55,450 --> 00:34:02,330
...Mohan Swami's statement and the blood-stained note
that was found in Naidu's house during examination...

415
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:07,620
It is clear that Mr and Mrs Naidu were involved.

416
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:13,040
But it remains to be investigated if they had
a partner in crime.

417
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:22,750
I thought their's was a sweet and innocent family...

418
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:25,750
But they turned out to be killers
who were greedy for gold.

419
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:37,000
If their bones have been found now,
there's definitely someone else involved...

420
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:40,120
...Who betrayed them in the end.

421
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,080
And amidst all this greed...

422
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,040
...That poor kid...

423
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:04,040
27th May, 1985.

424
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:06,660
A new evidence has emerged.

425
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:11,910
I request to transfer this case from C report to A report.

426
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,330
signed Investigative Officer Muthanna.

427
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:30,080
Mr and Mrs Naidu's greed led to the death of Suresh
and their own daughter, Vaidehi.

428
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,950
Surely, Naidu's partner was someone close to him.

429
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,830
Who in this list has lied?

430
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,500
Who could have been greedier than Naidu?

431
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:16,830
On Old Madras road, 50 Kms from Sajjapur Circle
there's a Hanuman temple...

432
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,660
Information is accurate sir.

433
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:23,870
-Please let me know what you find from Muthanna sir.
- Ok Ok.

434
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,450
Hello!

435
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:38,620
Is anybody there?

436
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:42,120
Hello!

437
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,080
Who the hell are you??

438
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:55,750
Are you mad? I could have lost my life.

439
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:00,160
You can still lose it.

440
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,870
What were you doing out there?

441
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:10,790
Sir, I'm Shyam...

442
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:14,370
Just answer my question.
I don't need any other details!

443
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:21,450
Sir in 1977, a man called Naidu robbed
the Archaeological department...

444
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:25,870
...murdered his colleague Suresh,
and then absconded with his family.

445
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:31,000
I found that you were the investigating officer on that case.

446
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:35,540
We have found that family sir.

447
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:38,450
Yes sir.

448
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:43,830
Their bones were found during a road widening project.

449
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,250
Sir...

450
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,500
...eight years after the case was closed,

451
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:59,750
On May 27, you filed a request to reopen
the case due to new evidence.

452
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:02,160
What happened on May 27, sir?

453
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,040
Sir?

454
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,500
Sir?

455
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:07,950
Sir?

456
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,040
Get out.

457
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,580
Get out.

458
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:14,700
Sir...

459
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,500
I said get out!!

460
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,700
Sir! Please calm down!

461
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:24,000
Sir, please don't shoot me.
Hear me out. One second, please.

462
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:28,500
Just give me one clue about
who Naidu's partner was, please.

463
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,160
Sir please sir.

464
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:33,080
Sir, nobody cares about this case.

465
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:38,870
I'm just a traffic inspector.
But I'm investigating this case round the clock.

466
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,620
Only you know this case. Please help me, sir.

467
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:45,290
Sir, you're a cop as well.
You know the situation I'm in.

468
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:46,910
Sir, please calm down.

469
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:52,370
The forensic details and the location of the bones are in this file sir.
Take a look.

470
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,290
I'll leave sir.

471
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:56,450
Please calm down! Sir.

472
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:52,830
I've got the carton.

473
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:54,870
I've called the barber.

474
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:56,910
The car mechanic is also coming.

475
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:59,450
My yesterday, today and tomorrow

476
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:03,200
Is like the emptiness of a blank page.

477
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:10,250
Life drags on slowly...

478
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:17,830
...Burdened by the weight of memories.

479
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:23,540
My destination is a far away place...

480
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:24,580
Mom....

481
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:27,700
But I'm stuck here without escape

482
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:29,200
Dad's come home early today.

483
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:32,450
Engulfed by incompleteness....

484
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,660
Really? Show me....

485
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:42,080
My yesterday, today and tomorrow...

486
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:47,250
...Is like an empty sheet of paper..

487
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:18,910
The mind is riddled with thoughts of a distant pain

488
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:27,160
These thoughts are an addiction
turning my life upside down...

489
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:34,580
...The unanswered questions mock me...

490
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:40,450
...Making me question myself.

491
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:44,700
When you set out on a journey into the unknown...

492
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:49,200
...It's like playing games with shadows.

493
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:54,040
Even if you find a way...

494
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:58,250
...The barbed fence looms over you..

495
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:06,830
...Finding its weakness is the only way through.

496
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:40,790
My yesterday, today and tomorrow

497
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:46,120
Is like the emptiness of a blank page.

498
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:51,200
Why don't you break away from your sorrow?

499
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:55,620
...Isn't there something to live for?

500
00:43:55,910 --> 00:44:00,250
Why don't you let go of past mistakes?...

501
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:04,450
...And seek the path to redemption.

502
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:12,330
A hundred stories lie hidden in your tears

503
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,540
They too are looking for redemption.

504
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:18,750
O God, why are you playing these games with me?

505
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:27,950
Stop!

506
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:36,410
If you set foot here again,
I will aim to kill you.

507
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:54,000
Shoot!

508
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,910
Aren't you ashamed to live like this?

509
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:08,790
Many cops spoke very highly off your bravery...

510
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,830
But that person cant be you.

511
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:14,910
You're just a coward resigned to his bottle.

512
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:18,290
A ten year old girl lost her life in this case.
Forget it.

513
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:21,160
I will not waste my time coming back here.

514
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:22,870
Enjoy your drink!

515
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:43,580
For a change, you've spent a joyous day with us.

516
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:46,790
Now all of a sudden,
why are you talking about death?

517
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:50,500
Death always comes unannounced...

518
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:52,540
Especially in my line of work.

519
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:55,500
Promise me, you'll do what I've said.

520
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,200
Geetha...?

521
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Ok!

522
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:15,620
You have to promise me something too,

523
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,580
In case if something happens to me,

524
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:25,410
No matter how hard it may be,
you have to live a good life.

525
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:33,160
Foolish girl! What can happen to you?

526
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:37,200
Doesnt death come unannounced?

527
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:39,120
Promise me.

528
00:46:59,290 --> 00:46:59,750
Sir!

529
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:00,700
Sir!

530
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:14,200
Sir!

531
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:28,950
As a policeman, when some cases are closed,

532
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:31,200
We get a good night's sleep.

533
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:36,620
While certain cases haunt us
and keep us up all night.

534
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:38,330
Like this one.

535
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:42,000
Those were the days of emergency.

536
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:45,120
The entire nation was immersed in darkness.

537
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,290
I don't think you were even born then!

538
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,000
No sir

539
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:55,040
Back then,
I was in the same spot where you are today.

540
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:58,410
I couldn't get this case out of my head.

541
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:03,160
I searched for Naidu and his family everywhere.

542
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:06,660
What made you think of reopening this case?

543
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:11,290
While investigating, once we see someone as a suspect...

544
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:13,410
We only see the wrongs in him.

545
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:15,620
I made the same mistake, too.

546
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:19,790
-You mean to say Naidu didn't commit the crime?
-No.

547
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:21,620
Naidu is innocent.

548
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:27,330
We were deceived into thinking Naidu killed Suresh.

549
00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:31,160
But the person who killed Suresh killed Naidu as well.

550
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:34,540
Poor Naidu wasn't escaping that night,

551
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,370
He was being buried here with his family.

552
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:44,540
So somebody else escaped that night.

553
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:48,250
Sir, then what was that new evidence?

554
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:50,410
There was no new evidence.

555
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,750
Sometimes during an investigation, to see the truth...

556
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:58,200
We have to become blind to all the lies.

557
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,200
While searching Naidu's home,

558
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:04,910
We found a blood-stained letter.

559
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:09,540
You'd tried to figure out whose handwriting it was...

560
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:13,000
I read about it in the case diary.

561
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,160
Eight years after Naidu went missing...

562
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,580
While investigating another case,

563
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,830
I saw the same handwriting again in a medical report.

564
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:29,080
That night, forget killing someone,
Naidu saved a man's life.

565
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:48,790
Sir!!!

566
00:49:54,410 --> 00:49:55,200
Doctor!

567
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:02,120
-Please bring these medicines.
-Ok!

568
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:05,120
Good girl!

569
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:22,370
Vaidehi!

570
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:25,870
Vaidehi!

571
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,000
Who do you think did it sir?

572
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:11,580
Shyam, it's almost 40 years now.

573
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:17,250
Its hard to say if the murderer
made it big with that loot.

574
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,790
Even if he made it,
we don't know if he is still alive?

575
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,950
Sir, how do you think we should investigate this now?

576
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:30,830
After so many years, you have
once again stoked the policeman in me.

577
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:34,410
But I don't want to be a policeman anymore.

578
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,870
I'm confident that you will find your own path soon.

579
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:38,660
Good luck.

580
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:41,790
Sir!

581
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,870
Let me drive you back. Give the me keys.

582
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:48,250
Why?

583
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:50,910
You're not allowed to drink and drive.

584
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:59,540
Sir, did you stop investigating the case
because of your family?

585
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:10,250
I'm very sorry if I asked you a personal question.

586
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:12,580
Please don't mind.

587
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:35,540
Sir...

588
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:40,790
Geetha.

589
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,080
My daughter Divya.

590
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:50,750
Every time I looked at my daughter,
I wanted to make the world a better place for her.

591
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:55,040
I worked sincerely towards making that happen.

592
00:52:57,370 --> 00:52:58,950
Then came the Emergency.

593
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:03,370
And the forces responsible for the emergency...

594
00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:11,700
Made it possible for rowdies
and goons to get into politics.

595
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:16,160
But I continued working sincerely.

596
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:22,830
One day I asked Geetha to bring
Divya to a nearby theater...

597
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:26,200
The plan was to watch a movie and go out for dinner.

598
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,790
Just as I was about to leave work to see them,
I found the doctor's handwriting.

599
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:37,660
I went to meet the doctor instead of going to the theatre.

600
00:53:38,330 --> 00:53:39,250
It got late.

601
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:44,620
Since I missed the film,
they thought I wouldnt make it for dinner also.

602
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,160
So they returned home.

603
00:53:47,330 --> 00:53:51,660
On the way, they met with an accident.
And I lost both of them.

604
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:56,200
The day it happened was...

605
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:57,950
May 27.

606
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:00,160
Damn!

607
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,790
After I lost them,
the world didn't matter to me anymore.

608
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,750
Like you said the other day,

609
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:10,450
I'm a coward resigned to his bottle...

610
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:13,000
-Sir, please forgive me...
-...Leading a pathetic life.

611
00:54:13,910 --> 00:54:15,120
I didn't mean that.

612
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:20,120
I didn't lose them because of the Naidu case.

613
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:24,910
I lost them because of my obsession to solve the case.

614
00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:28,040
I lost them to my obsession.

615
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,000
Sir!

616
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:36,580
Once Naidu was found to be innocent
What if they decided to target you and ended up....

617
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:42,000
Had that been the case,

618
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:46,200
You think I'd have spared them?

619
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:03,500
Its me Kumar, I've found an important clue
regarding our case, can we meet?

620
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:08,250
Super sir, I'll come by today evening.Thanks

621
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,410
Kumar!

622
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,080
Excuse me!

623
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:31,000
Where's your father?

624
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:33,580
I've been trying to call him.
His phone is off.

625
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:35,540
I don't know.

626
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:38,450
He left for work yesterday
and hasn't returned since.

627
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:40,160
Why? What happened?

628
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:45,830
He never listens to me.

629
00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:48,410
When was the last time you spoke to him?

630
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:53,330
To avoid calls from loan sharks,
he switches off his phone.

631
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:58,660
Was there any change in his behavior in the recent past?

632
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:01,790
After you visited,

633
00:56:01,870 --> 00:56:05,540
He was saying that you have given
him a story that will change our life.

634
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:10,410
He was looking at old film magazines and newspapers
He wanted to do a story on actress Madhuri.

635
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:15,790
He was very excited about interviewing her.

636
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:17,580
Thank you.

637
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:20,790
If you get to speak to him, call me immediately.

638
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,950
Don't worry, take care.

639
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:57,500
That ring is haunting...

640
00:56:57,910 --> 00:57:04,700
Your reasons are invisible to my gaze...

641
00:57:05,370 --> 00:57:11,790
The sadness in my heart is strange...

642
00:57:12,290 --> 00:57:19,000
Even the ice cool breeze burns me...

643
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:37,580
Cut! Cut! Cut! Who is that extra smiling in the shot?

644
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:39,370
-Throw him out now!
-You, get out!

645
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:40,660
-Sorry, sorry.
-Leave!!

646
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:42,290
What's happening? Oh God!
- Sorry Ma'am.

647
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:45,370
Come in.

648
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:52,790
-Shivu, in my bag...
-Excuse me.

649
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:55,290
-Hi ma'am.
-What are you doing here?

650
00:57:55,950 --> 00:57:58,250
-Shivu!
-Ma'am, one minute!

651
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:02,330
Listen, please go outside. I'll talk to you there.

652
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:07,000
I'm very sorry.
I came in because you asked me to do so.

653
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:10,000
And this uniform is not on rent.

654
00:58:10,910 --> 00:58:13,000
I need to question you about a case.

655
00:58:13,910 --> 00:58:14,950
I'll be waiting outside.

656
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:16,500
Ok?

657
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:36,500
Sir, Madam asked for you.

658
00:58:37,370 --> 00:58:38,370
-Thank you.
-Ok sir.

659
00:58:39,290 --> 00:58:45,540
Our world is a make believe one.
We are detached from reality.

660
00:58:46,830 --> 00:58:52,620
In our world, police officers dance
and shoot with plastic guns.

661
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,870
Your gun must be real, isn't it?

662
00:58:59,330 --> 00:59:02,330
I suppose you make everyone dance
to your tunes with it...

663
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:06,500
Tell me what can I do for you?

664
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:07,830
Lock-up news.

665
00:59:09,290 --> 00:59:10,160
Come in!

666
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:13,200
Madam, shot ready.

667
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:19,120
I'll come back and dance to your tunes.

668
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:25,620
Its an unquenchable desire...

669
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:32,410
There’s no trace of where this longing stems from..

670
00:59:33,330 --> 00:59:39,080
You and I pine to be bound by love and desire.

671
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:48,290
Had Kumar, the editor and owner
of Lock-up News contacted you?

672
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:52,750
Is there a punishment for smoking
in front of an officer?

673
00:59:53,330 --> 00:59:53,950
Look....

674
00:59:55,410 --> 00:59:56,910
Ok! Ok! Ok!

675
00:59:58,160 --> 00:59:59,620
He called me two days ago.

676
01:00:01,830 --> 01:00:02,750
And what did he say?

677
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:06,540
-Some interview...
-Did you meet him?

678
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:11,370
I don't meet everyone who asks me for an interview.

679
01:00:13,450 --> 01:00:14,330
Come in!

680
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,370
-Shot ready madam!
-Coming!

681
01:00:16,410 --> 01:00:18,000
Sorry, I'm wasting your time.

682
01:00:18,830 --> 01:00:21,080
Moreover, you've said I'll be punished!

683
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,200
But I have to go.

684
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:26,750
Yeah

685
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:31,700
Sir, madam will be late today.
She has asked for your number.

686
01:00:41,410 --> 01:00:42,370
Thank you

687
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:49,250
I have no clue when he comes and goes.

688
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:51,750
This actress... What did you say her name was?

689
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:53,790
Sir, Madhuri

690
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:55,410
Madhuri?

691
01:00:57,250 --> 01:00:59,950
Her name never came up in my investigation.

692
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:04,450
How do you know she is connected
to the Naidu case?

693
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:08,040
Sir, Kumar's investigation into this case
led to her name.

694
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:14,370
Sir, if you have any notes
from your independent investigation...

695
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:16,500
Could I take a lo ok at it?

696
01:01:19,830 --> 01:01:21,040
Thank you.

697
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:34,700
8 o clock!

698
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:36,160
So punctual!

699
01:01:37,450 --> 01:01:39,950
Or you couldn't wait to see me again?

700
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:44,410
You act only for the camera or off it too?

701
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:47,330
Ha! Come in.

702
01:01:53,790 --> 01:01:55,790
I was hoping to see you in the uniform.

703
01:01:58,290 --> 01:02:00,290
Have you ever heard of the name Gurudas Naidu?

704
01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:03,290
The night is still young Shyam.

705
01:02:04,290 --> 01:02:05,410
I'll get you a drink.

706
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:15,540
Make yourself comfortable.

707
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:28,160
Is there a Mrs Shyam?

708
01:02:29,870 --> 01:02:30,450
No.

709
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:36,080
Girlfriend?

710
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,660
Actually I don't care.

711
01:02:41,370 --> 01:02:43,040
Your drink.

712
01:02:48,410 --> 01:02:49,250
Thank you.

713
01:02:58,290 --> 01:02:58,950
Cheers!

714
01:03:00,830 --> 01:03:01,580
Cheers!

715
01:03:08,830 --> 01:03:10,750
Do you know anything about Gurudas Naidu?

716
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:14,700
He used to work in the Archaeological Department.

717
01:03:15,870 --> 01:03:16,290
He...

718
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:22,080
In 1977, his entire family...

719
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:26,160
Much better!

720
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:29,040
In 1977, His family and...

721
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:33,000
What were you saying?

722
01:03:35,290 --> 01:03:37,370
Want some more ice?

723
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:16,200
Hey, he's heading towards you.

724
01:04:26,910 --> 01:04:28,700
The questions might seem a harsh...

725
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:30,450
-But don't stop, ok?
-Sure.

726
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:31,620
One second.

727
01:04:32,580 --> 01:04:35,330
What he means is keep
coming back to the same point?

728
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:39,040
How many times to call you?
Why can't you answer?

729
01:04:39,410 --> 01:04:41,370
Aren't you ashamed to call me?

730
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:42,750
Hang up!

731
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:45,410
Please don't hang up.

732
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:48,080
Listen, I have a major story for you.

733
01:04:48,620 --> 01:04:51,580
If you break it, the results will be
decided even before the elections.

734
01:04:51,950 --> 01:04:52,450
Oh yeah?

735
01:04:52,910 --> 01:04:54,500
You said the same thing last time.

736
01:04:54,830 --> 01:04:56,910
I was jobless for 2 years
because of you.

737
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,790
No thanks. You break your own story.

738
01:05:00,330 --> 01:05:03,830
Listen, I made a mistake last time.
I hid many details from you.

739
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:08,040
You just meet me once.
I'll tell you the entire story.

740
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,700
You can decide after that.

741
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:11,500
Ok...

742
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:13,120
Ok...

743
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:20,290
Hey A******,You are done!

744
01:05:22,370 --> 01:05:24,370
Trying to escape my eye, huh?

745
01:05:35,910 --> 01:05:36,750
Hello

746
01:05:38,620 --> 01:05:40,790
The doctor said its still uncertain.

747
01:05:40,830 --> 01:05:42,450
He is under observation.

748
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:45,450
Once the scan reports come back...
excuse me...

749
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,700
He never listens to me.

750
01:05:53,910 --> 01:05:56,120
I've told him we can lead a good life
with what we make.

751
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,160
He wont shut down that wretched press.

752
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:05,750
Sometimes I feel like setting that place on fire.

753
01:06:05,910 --> 01:06:07,500
Hey, stop.

754
01:06:08,450 --> 01:06:10,790
You'll only inspire him to start a new press.

755
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,370
Don't worry.

756
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:18,200
Let's see what the doctor says.

757
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:24,660
Do you know who might have done this?

758
01:06:27,410 --> 01:06:29,790
Despite my protests,
he's taken so many loans.

759
01:06:29,950 --> 01:06:32,080
I assume you know how he writes...

760
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:36,500
Keep me posted...

761
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:39,540
Sorry...guess I wasted your time

762
01:06:39,950 --> 01:06:42,450
Nothing of that sort. I'll leave now.

763
01:06:46,370 --> 01:06:49,830
-The final round of voting has just concluded.
-Ajay, call for a break.

764
01:06:49,830 --> 01:06:51,160
Santhosh,
-Yes sir

765
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,370
Get a 30-second clip with the
latest photos and videos of actress Madhuri.

766
01:06:56,830 --> 01:06:57,330
Go!

767
01:06:57,660 --> 01:06:58,200
Deepak!

768
01:06:58,290 --> 01:07:01,200
-Abhi, push the election news to the scrolling tab.
-Ok sir.

769
01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:04,370
And you, write down what I tell you...

770
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:08,330
Popular film actress...

771
01:07:08,450 --> 01:07:11,370
Evergreen heroine Madhuri has been found murdered.

772
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:17,200
Having ruled the roost in the past,
her popularity remained unfazed even today.

773
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,250
Here are the first images of the scene.
The police have begun investigations.

774
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:24,250
Here's what the police are saying...

775
01:07:24,370 --> 01:07:27,200
We don't know right now.
Investigations is on-going.

776
01:07:27,330 --> 01:07:28,620
So, no comments right now.

777
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:30,870
Further information is awaited.

778
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:35,580
We will update you with a blow-by-blow
account of the same.

779
01:07:37,290 --> 01:07:40,500
That's ok Shyam but what were
you doing in her house?

780
01:07:45,870 --> 01:07:48,580
So inspector... you...

781
01:07:48,790 --> 01:07:50,000
Did you call me?

782
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:53,540
Stop toying with me.

783
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:02,330
This is a murder investigation.

784
01:08:03,410 --> 01:08:04,700
Not a joke.

785
01:08:09,290 --> 01:08:12,160
One of the murder victims was a
10-year-old child.

786
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:17,450
You're not my type.

787
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:20,370
I'm sorry.

788
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:25,830
I've volunteered this information
without hiding anything.

789
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:28,250
You can investigate and verify the same.

790
01:08:29,370 --> 01:08:31,500
I'm also from the police dept. I won't run away.

791
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:33,120
Ok. I'll call you.

792
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:18,410
Muthanna sir!

793
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:20,700
Sir!

794
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:24,950
Muthanna sir!

795
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:27,580
Sir!

796
01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:28,250
Shyam?

797
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:29,080
Sir!

798
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:34,580
The Naidu case, Madhuri and Kumar
share a strong connection!

799
01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:38,040
-What do you mean?
-Sir...

800
01:09:40,290 --> 01:09:43,410
At Madhuri's house.
I saw a photo of her wearing this necklace.

801
01:09:43,410 --> 01:09:44,120
Oh my god!

802
01:09:44,830 --> 01:09:46,370
-I'll change and come.
-Ok sir.

803
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:52,830
Come in sir.

804
01:09:57,580 --> 01:10:00,410
The Naidu case and Madhuri is definitely connected...

805
01:10:00,410 --> 01:10:01,290
...that necklace...

806
01:10:01,790 --> 01:10:03,330
This is the photo I spoke about.

807
01:10:05,790 --> 01:10:06,660
Come sir, let's go up.

808
01:10:23,580 --> 01:10:24,830
Sir, careful...

809
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:27,750
Nothing here Shyam...

810
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:29,830
Hey!

811
01:10:37,290 --> 01:10:38,120
S**t!

812
01:10:56,660 --> 01:10:57,750
Hey, wake up!

813
01:10:57,950 --> 01:10:59,120
Follow them!

814
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:16,250
Don't think its an old car Shyam...

815
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:42,080
Damn!!

816
01:11:54,660 --> 01:11:55,500
Shyam...

817
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:58,450
If we stop to explain to the cops,
he will escape. Lose them.

818
01:12:30,790 --> 01:12:31,500
Control Room...

819
01:12:31,830 --> 01:12:34,120
Suspect vehicle with an unclear number plate..

820
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:36,540
A blue fiat...Report if you spot it. Over.

821
01:12:38,370 --> 01:12:39,160
Control...

822
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:42,040
A blue fiat is headed towards Lalbagh. Watch out.

823
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:47,200
Spotted near Lalbagh. Over.

824
01:12:47,250 --> 01:12:47,910
Go that way.

825
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:51,160
Yes!

826
01:12:53,330 --> 01:12:54,620
Control, it's PSI speaking...

827
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:57,080
Suspect Vehicle,
a black I20 going towards Hebbal.

828
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:58,450
If you spot it, let me know.

829
01:13:05,370 --> 01:13:06,330
Charlie speaking...

830
01:13:06,330 --> 01:13:08,200
Suspect vehicle, a black I20 has been spotted...

831
01:13:08,370 --> 01:13:09,580
below the Hebbal flyover...

832
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:10,000
Over

833
01:13:23,450 --> 01:13:25,160
Not bad, Shyam.

834
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:26,950
Thanks, sir.

835
01:13:44,870 --> 01:13:46,160
-Let's go sir.
-No! Don't...

836
01:13:48,370 --> 01:13:49,870
He's just a pretty criminal.

837
01:13:50,410 --> 01:13:51,120
Look at him.

838
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:53,410
If you catch him ...

839
01:13:53,790 --> 01:13:56,580
We won't be able to track who controls him.

840
01:14:09,410 --> 01:14:12,750
You must've waited this way many times before, no?

841
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:14,410
Didn't you get bored?

842
01:14:15,950 --> 01:14:16,910
In the beginning...

843
01:14:17,950 --> 01:14:21,200
... It was very tough to sit in one place and wait.

844
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:24,660
Just like how you are feeling now.

845
01:14:26,410 --> 01:14:32,370
But in the end, the satisfaction of
putting a criminal behind bars…

846
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:34,580
...is worth the wait.

847
01:14:35,750 --> 01:14:37,500
Waiting becomes a habit.

848
01:14:43,950 --> 01:14:45,580
It's like hunting, isn't it sir?

849
01:14:54,660 --> 01:14:55,790
Sir...

850
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:59,410
When you were investigating this case independently...

851
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:02,040
... didn't the department have a problem?

852
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,160
Like I told you before...

853
01:15:03,830 --> 01:15:07,370
...It was a period when goons and rowdies got into politics.

854
01:15:08,790 --> 01:15:10,500
They didn't care about cops...

855
01:15:11,370 --> 01:15:16,410
So when I was investigating independently,
I never used my real name anywhere.

856
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:18,080
Really?

857
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:20,700
I called myself Inspector Shenoy.

858
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:24,830
Which is why nobody was able to trace
anything back to you!

859
01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:28,160
But now you know!

860
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:33,200
-You continue the hunt...
-Ok sir!

861
01:15:33,290 --> 01:15:34,620
I'll take a nap in the back.

862
01:15:34,870 --> 01:15:35,580
Ok sir!

863
01:15:53,910 --> 01:15:55,830
I think he's a mechanic sir.

864
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:01,410
Why don't you get some rest?

865
01:16:01,450 --> 01:16:03,580
Let me keep an eye on him.

866
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:41,250
Sir, what are you doing?

867
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:45,950
I'm helping this fly attain nirvana.

868
01:17:15,580 --> 01:17:16,500
I'll be back in a bit.

869
01:17:16,540 --> 01:17:17,080
Yes sir.

870
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:20,370
If he moves, call me.
I'll come wherever you are.

871
01:17:20,870 --> 01:17:21,700
Yes, sure sir.

872
01:17:23,540 --> 01:17:24,910
Where does this road go?

873
01:17:24,950 --> 01:17:25,750
To Kunigal sir.

874
01:17:25,870 --> 01:17:27,700
These are newly-developed areas.

875
01:17:33,540 --> 01:17:35,120
Is this a new layout?

876
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:37,870
No sir. It came up about 15 years ago.

877
01:17:38,410 --> 01:17:41,410
What is he doing here?
He's definitely not here to fix a car.

878
01:17:41,660 --> 01:17:43,910
It's the small fish that leads us to the whale.

879
01:18:07,950 --> 01:18:08,830
Sir!

880
01:18:09,450 --> 01:18:10,250
Please come.

881
01:19:13,870 --> 01:19:14,580
Muthanna sir!!

882
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:17,040
Come fast sir!
We'll lose him otherwise.

883
01:19:18,370 --> 01:19:19,330
I'll go after him.

884
01:19:20,250 --> 01:19:22,080
I've been here before...

885
01:19:23,660 --> 01:19:28,160
I found Naidu's burning car
and the murder weapon right here!

886
01:19:38,290 --> 01:19:39,500
Oh my god!

887
01:19:41,410 --> 01:19:45,790
...Gopi Nayak has alleged that your party
is using black money for campaigning...

888
01:19:45,870 --> 01:19:47,580
What do you have to say to this sir?

889
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:50,500
Listen...

890
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:55,120
...Don't take Gopi Nayak's words seriously...

891
01:19:55,660 --> 01:20:00,000
The man who controls this mechanic
could also be the one who is set to rule us sir.

892
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:07,160
...The people still remember who appealed for votes
by luring women with saris and the men with liquor!..

893
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:13,540
...Thankfully, we didn’t rise to power by
resorting to such illicit means...

894
01:20:15,250 --> 01:20:17,080
The killer is in this room itself.

895
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:20,580
...Our party workers have been
extremely sincere in their work...

896
01:20:20,910 --> 01:20:22,160
I have a question.

897
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:26,910
Our channel had aired a special report on the EVM scam.
What does your party have to say?

898
01:20:26,950 --> 01:20:30,540
...For those questioning the popular choice,
watch the election results...

899
01:20:30,830 --> 01:20:33,330
...The exit poll outcome is very positive towards us...

900
01:20:33,410 --> 01:20:37,950
Madhuri’s murder, Naidu case and this place,
Its all connected, sir.

901
01:20:39,910 --> 01:20:41,370
This is not a coincidence.

902
01:20:41,450 --> 01:20:46,410
...You can be sure we will fulfill all the promises
made in the manifesto on the oath-taking day...

903
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:50,750
...This is my word and that of our party's.
We believe in keeping our word....

904
01:20:58,790 --> 01:20:59,370
Dad!

905
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:02,790
When did you wake up dad ?...

906
01:21:02,830 --> 01:21:03,660
Dad?

907
01:21:03,790 --> 01:21:04,950
Is your head hurting?

908
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,500
Wait, let me fetch the doctor.

909
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:07,370
Wait my dear...

910
01:21:07,370 --> 01:21:08,870
Come here... Come..

911
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:09,910
Come ...

912
01:21:11,370 --> 01:21:11,830
Sit down.

913
01:21:11,910 --> 01:21:13,330
One second let me call the...

914
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:17,620
Listen... Please don't worry...
I'll be fine. Ok?

915
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:20,500
And I'll repay all the loans. Fine?

916
01:21:21,290 --> 01:21:23,200
Don't worry.

917
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:29,160
Don't cry my dear...

918
01:21:29,660 --> 01:21:30,950
Wait a minute, I'll be back.

919
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:32,450
Let me call the doctor.

920
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:37,200
Take a deep breath.

921
01:21:38,580 --> 01:21:39,870
Now exhale...

922
01:21:40,410 --> 01:21:41,790
Yes, yes.

923
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:42,790
Relax

924
01:21:42,910 --> 01:21:43,870
Inhale.

925
01:21:45,250 --> 01:21:46,250
Exhale.

926
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:52,910
Dad!

927
01:21:54,250 --> 01:21:55,330
Dad, what happened?

928
01:21:55,870 --> 01:21:57,080
Dad? Why are you crying?

929
01:21:57,540 --> 01:21:59,000
Dad? What happened?

930
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,200
What happened?

931
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:02,660
Doctor? Is he in pain? Doctor?

932
01:22:03,870 --> 01:22:04,370
Hello...

933
01:22:04,450 --> 01:22:05,450
Cut to Camera 5...

934
01:22:05,580 --> 01:22:07,450
Cut to the reactions from Camera 4 ...

935
01:22:07,790 --> 01:22:10,080
Sir, we've got confirmations from 3 sources.

936
01:22:10,410 --> 01:22:13,580
Let's wait. I want confirmation
from a proper source. Ok?

937
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:14,950
-...The elections...
-Cut to Close up.

938
01:22:14,950 --> 01:22:20,330
We will reveal which popular leader
is set to become the chief minister ...

939
01:22:20,450 --> 01:22:21,200
Cut to a wide.

940
01:22:23,370 --> 01:22:25,250
These money lenders are so stupid.

941
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:29,040
If they beat us up like this,
we end up spending even more.

942
01:22:30,450 --> 01:22:31,040
Of course!

943
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,450
You're the only wise one here...

944
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:36,580
In spite of knowing this, you borrow from them.
There's no point talking to you!

945
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:37,700
...Priya...

946
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:39,330
Relax... Relax....

947
01:22:40,370 --> 01:22:41,750
Camera 4. Stand-by.

948
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:43,830
Camera 2.

949
01:22:50,660 --> 01:22:51,700
Excuse me?

950
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:52,120
Yes sir...

951
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:53,250
Who owns this place?

952
01:22:53,290 --> 01:22:53,950
No clue sir.

953
01:23:23,790 --> 01:23:24,330
Why sir?!!

954
01:23:24,330 --> 01:23:25,790
Shut up! Rascal!

955
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:27,700
How dare you back answer!

956
01:23:27,950 --> 01:23:29,540
I'll break your bones!

957
01:23:29,620 --> 01:23:31,410
Don't you know who I am??

958
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:33,660
But you slapped me!
Why are you complaining?!

959
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:37,200
Your generation has no respect for senior citizens.

960
01:23:37,450 --> 01:23:39,080
I'm from the media.

961
01:23:39,250 --> 01:23:41,290
Go and call your owner!

962
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:42,580
Call him now!

963
01:23:42,580 --> 01:23:43,370
Ok, wait sir.

964
01:23:46,450 --> 01:23:48,500
-Sir, your comments?
- Camera 2. Keep zooming on him.

965
01:23:48,620 --> 01:23:52,450
How many times will you ask me the same question!
It's all in the news, take a look ...

966
01:23:52,580 --> 01:23:53,790
Cut to a close up.

967
01:23:54,330 --> 01:23:57,580
How did you know the connection
between Naidu and Madhuri?

968
01:23:58,580 --> 01:24:00,620
That jewelry...

969
01:24:01,290 --> 01:24:03,000
You don't know about Madhuri...

970
01:24:03,870 --> 01:24:06,040
When she entered the film industry ...

971
01:24:06,290 --> 01:24:08,330
... the biggest names were behind her.

972
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:11,540
I had a friend called Deshpande.

973
01:24:11,870 --> 01:24:14,120
He used to write for Samyukta Karnataka.

974
01:24:14,410 --> 01:24:18,160
Anyway, he died young.

975
01:24:18,250 --> 01:24:18,620
Ok...

976
01:24:18,660 --> 01:24:21,330
He had once told me a story about some rowdies.

977
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:24,410
Apparently, some guy was after Madhuri.

978
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:28,040
No, no. Our leader will show you
what our party is made of!

979
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:28,790
Cut to Close up.

980
01:24:28,870 --> 01:24:30,580
I'll shut this place down!

981
01:24:30,660 --> 01:24:31,910
Sir...He slapped me sir!

982
01:24:31,950 --> 01:24:33,580
What else did you expect?

983
01:24:33,910 --> 01:24:35,200
I'll smash your teeth!

984
01:24:35,410 --> 01:24:36,500
Do you even know who I am?

985
01:24:36,870 --> 01:24:39,540
You keep bringing this up again and again...

986
01:24:39,790 --> 01:24:41,410
Do you know who owns this resort?

987
01:24:41,540 --> 01:24:42,120
Who?

988
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:43,290
Camera 5 ...

989
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:47,700
He had apparently gifted her jewellery
dating back to the Hampi dynasty.

990
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,450
He had also funded a few of her films.

991
01:24:51,660 --> 01:24:57,620
Around the time Deshpande had told me the story
do you know who used to fund her films?

992
01:24:57,620 --> 01:24:58,330
Who?

993
01:24:58,660 --> 01:24:59,500
Who Kumar?

994
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:02,330
Do you know who he is?

995
01:25:02,580 --> 01:25:05,910
Here's an exclusive interview with the
newly elected chief minister...

996
01:25:05,910 --> 01:25:07,120
Mailur Srinivas...

997
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:08,000
Wait...

998
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:10,200
Wait.

999
01:25:11,250 --> 01:25:12,580
Cut to his speech.

1000
01:25:16,330 --> 01:25:17,500
Greetings to all.

1001
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:21,370
First of all ...

1002
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:26,250
You have shown great faith
in me and my party.

1003
01:25:27,290 --> 01:25:29,160
I thank you.

1004
01:25:29,370 --> 01:25:32,750
Though we investigated separately,
we both hit upon the same name...

1005
01:25:33,250 --> 01:25:39,160
Yes...I am certain that Mailur Srinivas
is involved in the Naidu case.

1006
01:25:39,540 --> 01:25:41,290
But I'm not able to figure out how...

1007
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:43,660
Who is this Mailur Srinivas?

1008
01:25:44,540 --> 01:25:46,000
Sir, I'll head to Mailur's right away.

1009
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:50,370
It is natural for the lion to smell your
presence when you enter his lair...

1010
01:25:50,910 --> 01:25:51,790
Take care, Shyam

1011
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:52,790
All right sir.

1012
01:26:16,290 --> 01:26:20,080
The man set to rule the state
used to live in this tiny house

1013
01:26:20,290 --> 01:26:26,120
Krishnappa, since Seenanna is arriving today,
this inspector has to carry out an inspection.

1014
01:26:26,580 --> 01:26:29,120
Sir, our village is small.

1015
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:32,250
But Seenanna has made our village world famous.

1016
01:26:32,330 --> 01:26:33,580
How long have you lived here?

1017
01:26:33,750 --> 01:26:35,040
25 years.

1018
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:37,910
Yes, he's been here since 25 years.
Isn't it Krishnappa?

1019
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:40,620
Our village is very safe, sir.

1020
01:26:41,870 --> 01:26:43,290
How much do you blabber?

1021
01:26:43,450 --> 01:26:44,250
Go out and wait.

1022
01:26:44,410 --> 01:26:45,000
Out!

1023
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:46,040
Ok sir

1024
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:49,910
-Can I check inside?
-Yes. OK.

1025
01:27:17,870 --> 01:27:18,750
Tell me Shyam...

1026
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:22,080
Sir... I searched the house Mailur Srinivas used to stay in.

1027
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:25,250
I found a few items related to Christianity in the loft.

1028
01:27:26,540 --> 01:27:29,790
But the tenants living there now are Hindus.

1029
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:33,580
In the Naidu case, there were 2 Christians,
peon Sebastian and driver Fernandes.

1030
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:36,700
Between the two of them,
who do you think is Mailur Srinivas?

1031
01:27:38,370 --> 01:27:40,330
I'll call you back.
Give me some time.

1032
01:27:51,910 --> 01:27:52,410
Uncle...

1033
01:27:52,620 --> 01:27:55,160
Do you need all this drama at your age uncle?

1034
01:27:57,330 --> 01:28:00,080
I was reading your paper while waiting for you.

1035
01:28:01,620 --> 01:28:02,870
You write really well.

1036
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:04,290
Do one thing.

1037
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:08,290
Why don't you retire?

1038
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:09,660
You get the idea uncle?

1039
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:12,450
See you soon uncle.

1040
01:28:19,370 --> 01:28:23,450
I've told you everything.
Please finish the work as soon as possible.

1041
01:28:24,620 --> 01:28:30,750
Boss, a man who runs a paper called Lock-Up News
apparently created trouble at the resort.

1042
01:28:31,910 --> 01:28:33,580
He's still there.

1043
01:28:35,330 --> 01:28:36,950
That journalist just left.

1044
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:38,450
I didn't see the cop around.

1045
01:28:38,540 --> 01:28:39,370
Who are these people sir?

1046
01:28:40,950 --> 01:28:42,700
Don't ask questions...

1047
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:46,000
-Take care of them.
-Ok sir.

1048
01:28:46,410 --> 01:28:48,040
Be discreet!

1049
01:30:33,620 --> 01:30:35,500
Fernandes!

1050
01:30:48,410 --> 01:30:51,120
Fernandes!!

1051
01:32:29,450 --> 01:32:30,910
Are both the jobs completed?

1052
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:32,910
Not yet.

1053
01:32:33,620 --> 01:32:34,950
Pradeepa also just arrived.

1054
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:37,700
I'm in front of that journalist's house.

1055
01:32:38,580 --> 01:32:40,120
The cop is nowhere to be seen.

1056
01:32:40,540 --> 01:32:42,950
What? Stop the car.

1057
01:32:45,540 --> 01:32:46,500
Wait outside.

1058
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:56,750
At the party headquarters,
you followed the cop...

1059
01:32:57,330 --> 01:32:58,750
No, that was the journalist.

1060
01:32:59,450 --> 01:33:00,450
Idiot!

1061
01:33:01,410 --> 01:33:04,290
He's not a journalist. He's a cop!

1062
01:33:05,700 --> 01:33:08,200
But boss... the cop isn't very old.

1063
01:33:08,950 --> 01:33:10,250
You A***********!

1064
01:33:11,700 --> 01:33:13,950
Both the men who were after you, are cops!

1065
01:33:15,910 --> 01:33:18,290
Find out the identity of the other guy and kill him.

1066
01:33:18,410 --> 01:33:20,870
Finish that journalist, too. Finish them all!

1067
01:33:21,700 --> 01:33:22,910
Ok.

1068
01:33:25,330 --> 01:33:26,950
-Come in the other car.
-Ok sir

1069
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:06,080
Yes sir...

1070
01:34:06,660 --> 01:34:09,000
Fernandes is Mailur Srinivas.

1071
01:34:10,830 --> 01:34:11,540
Really?

1072
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,040
How did you find out?

1073
01:34:13,410 --> 01:34:14,540
Sir? Where are you now?

1074
01:34:14,540 --> 01:34:16,000
Everything makes sense now.

1075
01:34:16,750 --> 01:34:19,450
I leave the responsibilty of this case to you now.

1076
01:34:19,660 --> 01:34:20,330
Sir but....

1077
01:34:20,700 --> 01:34:21,370
Sorry.

1078
01:34:21,750 --> 01:34:25,660
One more thing...
That journalist friend of yours is in danger.

1079
01:34:25,910 --> 01:34:26,830
Protect him.

1080
01:34:27,700 --> 01:34:30,950
Ok sir, I'll get Kumar to safety and then call you.

1081
01:35:59,540 --> 01:35:59,700
Get down! Get down!

1082
01:35:59,700 --> 01:36:01,040
Get down! Get down!
Get down! Get down!

1083
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:01,200
Get down! Get down!

1084
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:29,500
Wait, wait.

1085
01:36:31,290 --> 01:36:32,700
Single barrel uncle...

1086
01:36:32,950 --> 01:36:34,200
You get one hit!

1087
01:36:34,660 --> 01:36:38,790
Do you want to shoot me or him?

1088
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:11,870
You're finished uncle!

1089
01:37:16,750 --> 01:37:18,660
I'm not at all surprised...

1090
01:37:18,750 --> 01:37:21,160
He has a hand in all kinds of illegal activities.

1091
01:37:21,330 --> 01:37:26,250
Once you enter politics and don white,
your dirty work stays hidden in plain sight.

1092
01:37:27,200 --> 01:37:30,540
You're not safe here.
I'll ask them to discharge you immediately.

1093
01:37:32,950 --> 01:37:34,370
See you uncle.

1094
01:37:37,660 --> 01:37:40,450
-We've locked him up in his farm house only.
-Ask Pradeep to stay.

1095
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:42,450
-Finish off that journalist today!
-Ok sir

1096
01:37:42,580 --> 01:37:43,660
I'll come there.

1097
01:37:59,330 --> 01:38:01,370
Hello? Do you know where I can find Kumar?

1098
01:38:01,450 --> 01:38:03,790
He's been admitted to the Govt. hospital ...

1099
01:38:03,830 --> 01:38:04,540
Ok

1100
01:38:26,700 --> 01:38:29,290
-Close the door and wait outside.
-Ok, boss.

1101
01:38:31,540 --> 01:38:36,580
It felt really good to hear you utter
my name after so many years...

1102
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:39,910
Really, Fernandes?

1103
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:43,250
Then why did you change your name 'Fernandes'?

1104
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:50,910
Instead of celebrating your great victory,
why are you here talking to me?

1105
01:38:52,750 --> 01:38:54,370
Because you are scared.

1106
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:00,540
Nobody should find out your past as Fernandes.
Isn't that so?

1107
01:39:04,830 --> 01:39:08,250
Nostalgia is beautiful, no?

1108
01:39:08,410 --> 01:39:13,870
After murdering Suresh and robbing the treasury,
I could've escaped the same night.

1109
01:39:14,790 --> 01:39:21,040
But that would mean I'd have to keep looking
over my shoulder for the rest of my life...

1110
01:39:22,290 --> 01:39:28,160
I would have remained a driver all my life.

1111
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:31,330
Which is why...

1112
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:36,580
... I wiped out the Naidu family

1113
01:39:36,910 --> 01:39:38,620
Naidu's wife...

1114
01:39:45,330 --> 01:39:46,660
...10...

1115
01:39:47,250 --> 01:39:48,500
...9...

1116
01:39:49,330 --> 01:39:50,660
...8...

1117
01:39:51,700 --> 01:39:52,790
...7...

1118
01:39:52,870 --> 01:39:53,790
...6...

1119
01:39:54,040 --> 01:39:54,950
...5...

1120
01:39:55,160 --> 01:39:56,290
...4...

1121
01:39:56,540 --> 01:39:57,620
...3...

1122
01:39:57,790 --> 01:39:59,290
...2...

1123
01:39:59,370 --> 01:40:00,660
...1...

1124
01:40:10,250 --> 01:40:11,250
What are you doing here?

1125
01:40:11,290 --> 01:40:12,080
Sir!

1126
01:40:12,790 --> 01:40:15,290
I wanted to tell you something important, sir

1127
01:40:15,500 --> 01:40:17,450
At this hour?

1128
01:40:17,750 --> 01:40:19,950
You can tell me tomorrow...

1129
01:40:20,870 --> 01:40:22,250
Tomorrow?

1130
01:40:31,120 --> 01:40:33,410
I might have the time tomorrow...

1131
01:40:34,370 --> 01:40:36,330
...but I'm not so sure about you.

1132
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:41,790
Do you understand what I'm saying?

1133
01:40:43,580 --> 01:40:44,620
What's this?

1134
01:40:45,450 --> 01:40:48,870
Your wife and child reacted way better than you!

1135
01:40:56,200 --> 01:41:01,250
I haven't even begun counting and look at you...

1136
01:41:21,290 --> 01:41:23,160
It broke my heart.

1137
01:41:25,830 --> 01:41:27,450
Not because I killed them...

1138
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:30,500
...but because I had to set the car on fire.

1139
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:38,500
Poverty is wretched...

1140
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:40,370
I was naive.

1141
01:41:40,830 --> 01:41:42,580
Maybe I was still asleep.

1142
01:41:42,790 --> 01:41:47,160
I tried to work hard as a driver to make an earnest living.

1143
01:41:47,620 --> 01:41:49,250
-Suresh?...
-Yes sir...

1144
01:41:49,410 --> 01:41:51,120
Nayak had called.

1145
01:41:51,290 --> 01:41:55,160
The jewellery has been valued at Rs 85 lakh.
Our safe will do, right?

1146
01:41:55,410 --> 01:41:58,450
After overhearing their talk...

1147
01:41:59,500 --> 01:42:04,870
... the idea of owning such a loot
kept replaying in my head over and over...

1148
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:10,080
Until, the reflection in the mirror was no longer Fernandes.

1149
01:42:10,580 --> 01:42:11,410
Listen...

1150
01:42:11,950 --> 01:42:15,200
...don't get caught up with what's right and wrong.

1151
01:42:18,160 --> 01:42:21,580
Once you get out of that loop of
what's right and wrong...

1152
01:42:21,700 --> 01:42:26,410
...guiding others who are still stuck in that
loop is another kind of joy.

1153
01:42:26,660 --> 01:42:28,080
Don't you think?

1154
01:42:30,040 --> 01:42:31,500
He's a monster sir...

1155
01:42:32,790 --> 01:42:35,000
He didn't even spare the small girl.

1156
01:42:36,290 --> 01:42:40,660
Curse my luck.
I seem to be a magnet for the bad times.

1157
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,950
If my newspaper wasn't going through a loss...

1158
01:42:45,620 --> 01:42:49,120
...I'd have shown the whole world
the real face of Mailur Srinivas.

1159
01:42:49,700 --> 01:42:52,040
He's not scared of anyone sir.

1160
01:42:52,620 --> 01:42:54,410
He has changed his religion also.

1161
01:42:54,660 --> 01:42:58,660
If he's not afraid of God himself,
you think he'll fear the law?

1162
01:43:02,660 --> 01:43:04,410
We should just shoot him!

1163
01:43:06,540 --> 01:43:08,620
After all he's a driver.

1164
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:13,200
He alone is responsible for this!
We should kill him.

1165
01:43:23,580 --> 01:43:27,330
There was a boy in Naidu's house, called Babloo...

1166
01:43:27,910 --> 01:43:29,500
Do you remember him?

1167
01:43:31,410 --> 01:43:32,790
Nice boy.

1168
01:43:33,370 --> 01:43:35,410
He was very fond of Naidu's daughter.

1169
01:43:35,540 --> 01:43:39,750
He wanted to go to college and
become a big man like his boss.

1170
01:43:40,700 --> 01:43:45,870
It's very easy to mislead people
who have such big dreams.

1171
01:43:47,080 --> 01:43:49,830
Even I dream of buying a car!

1172
01:43:50,830 --> 01:43:59,250
But how can poor people like us have such big dreams?
We'll be poor all our life.

1173
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:07,830
The shortest path needs to be presented
to the most difficult dream. That's it.

1174
01:44:08,660 --> 01:44:12,830
I gave him sleeping pills to mix into their dinner.

1175
01:44:14,750 --> 01:44:16,540
Don't be scared.

1176
01:44:16,700 --> 01:44:19,700
Our lives will change for the better soon.

1177
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:24,790
But I didn't tell him that it was poison.

1178
01:44:26,620 --> 01:44:30,000
Where is this Naidu?
He should have been here...

1179
01:44:35,540 --> 01:44:37,500
You've killed her!

1180
01:44:37,910 --> 01:44:39,330
Don't forget that.

1181
01:44:41,080 --> 01:44:42,750
Stop crying.

1182
01:44:43,450 --> 01:44:44,660
Keep quiet.

1183
01:44:58,790 --> 01:45:04,660
Since Naidu came home late...
I was worried my plans wouldn't work out.

1184
01:45:05,410 --> 01:45:07,620
But lady luck was with me.

1185
01:45:09,370 --> 01:45:11,540
Hey, switch off the lights!

1186
01:45:31,620 --> 01:45:35,620
According to my plan, even Babloo
should've met his end that day.

1187
01:45:40,250 --> 01:45:44,620
But there was a lot of work to be done before daybreak.

1188
01:45:46,870 --> 01:45:50,410
Hey, don't forget what I told you...

1189
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:54,620
I put my faith in Babloo's big dreams and...

1190
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:58,660
...ensuring he wouldn't blab to the cops,
I left to get rid off the bodies.

1191
01:45:58,910 --> 01:46:01,750
-Where are you taking them?
-None of your business.

1192
01:46:01,870 --> 01:46:02,910
Just do what you're told.

1193
01:46:03,620 --> 01:46:07,000
Babloo's dreams also
died a natural death the same day.

1194
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:15,040
Although his dreams were larger than life,
he wasn't able to fulfill them...

1195
01:46:15,450 --> 01:46:21,080
Now he's lost everything and is
running some paper called Lock-Up News.

1196
01:46:21,540 --> 01:46:23,950
That's the difference between him and me.

1197
01:46:24,160 --> 01:46:26,870
I didn't dream about becoming rich alone.

1198
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:28,870
I was interested in politics too.

1199
01:46:29,330 --> 01:46:32,500
I grew to such an extent that
nobody could touch me.

1200
01:46:35,580 --> 01:46:37,620
B****d is now the Chief Minister!

1201
01:46:37,830 --> 01:46:42,200
He's worked very hard to unravel
my real identity to the world! He's failed each time.

1202
01:46:45,620 --> 01:46:49,830
But where will he summon the courage to
unravel the complete truth about me, huh?

1203
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:53,000
Laxman, my friend, is the editor of TV7 ...

1204
01:46:53,450 --> 01:46:55,160
I had set up a meeting with him...

1205
01:46:55,370 --> 01:46:57,120
And then this incident happened.

1206
01:46:57,620 --> 01:46:59,450
Those bloody goons attacked me.

1207
01:47:00,200 --> 01:47:02,200
Sir, let's do one thing.

1208
01:47:02,830 --> 01:47:05,040
Let's expose Mailur's truth!

1209
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:09,750
Yes sir.

1210
01:47:09,830 --> 01:47:10,660
Dad!

1211
01:47:12,410 --> 01:47:13,660
What are you doing here?

1212
01:47:13,870 --> 01:47:16,160
But he's not brave enough to expose the truth...

1213
01:47:16,330 --> 01:47:17,450
Come let's go...

1214
01:47:17,580 --> 01:47:19,660
He's a murderer too, isn't he?

1215
01:47:19,660 --> 01:47:22,500
I'm glad those bones were found.

1216
01:47:24,620 --> 01:47:27,410
All of you will die shortly...

1217
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:32,540
It was wonderful to go down memory lane.

1218
01:47:32,790 --> 01:47:36,660
I can see another face in the mirror.

1219
01:47:37,250 --> 01:47:41,200
Prime Minister Srinivas.

1220
01:47:44,830 --> 01:47:46,870
Sounds wonderful, right?

1221
01:47:49,450 --> 01:47:54,660
But a small stone is enough to break the mirror!

1222
01:48:08,250 --> 01:48:09,950
And who will break it?

1223
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:26,120
Boss

1224
01:48:27,620 --> 01:48:31,290
Find out the name of the other cop and finish him.

1225
01:48:31,830 --> 01:48:32,790
Ok boss.

1226
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:39,910
Madam? Is there a patient called
Kumar admitted here?

1227
01:48:40,120 --> 01:48:41,410
He's been discharged.

1228
01:48:41,580 --> 01:48:42,450
Really?

1229
01:48:44,830 --> 01:48:47,080
Dad! I keep asking you ...

1230
01:48:47,290 --> 01:48:48,700
Why can't we go home?

1231
01:48:49,370 --> 01:48:50,830
What new trouble are you in now?

1232
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:54,120
Tell me. I'll handle it.

1233
01:48:57,500 --> 01:48:58,580
I'm talking to you!

1234
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:02,120
It's nothing.

1235
01:49:04,370 --> 01:49:05,830
Look at how they beat him up!

1236
01:49:06,910 --> 01:49:10,330
Do you know what a big rowdy his landlord is?

1237
01:49:11,540 --> 01:49:12,830
Why is he lying about us?

1238
01:49:13,160 --> 01:49:14,120
Tell me now!

1239
01:49:14,250 --> 01:49:18,200

Now I'll do the same!

1241
01:49:24,700 --> 01:49:28,290
Listen I've told her about your situation.
Ask aunty if you need anything.

1242
01:49:28,620 --> 01:49:29,950
One more thing...

1243
01:49:30,370 --> 01:49:33,830
Don't reveal where you are
to anyone under any circumstance.

1244
01:49:34,290 --> 01:49:35,000

1250
01:50:02,200 --> 01:50:04,040
Why all this secrecy. At least I can...

1252
01:50:06,410 --> 01:50:08,580
I'll tell you everything when the time is right.

1253
01:50:09,830 --> 01:50:10,500
Ok?

1254
01:50:12,500 --> 01:50:14,830
Don't worry, Kumar hasn't caused any trouble.

1255
01:50:15,370 --> 01:50:16,500
He's done no wrong.

1256
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:19,330
I had asked for his help with this case.

1257
01:50:19,830 --> 01:50:22,910
It's my duty to ensure he's not in any harm.

1258
01:50:24,160 --> 01:50:25,750

1259
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:27,120

1264
01:50:42,480 --> 01:50:43,940
What is his name?

1265
01:50:44,150 --> 01:50:46,270
What is the other cop's name?

1266
01:51:24,730 --> 01:51:27,900

1278

You keep driving.

Sir, there's an ambulance behind you.
Please make way!

1283
01:54:26,520 --> 01:54:28,230

I'm very sorry.
It's really very unfortunate what has happened ...

1292
01:55:07,400 --> 01:55:10,230
If you got here sooner,
we could have saved him.

1293
01:55:38,310 --> 01:55:42,190
If they were sincere, you think this nation
would've seen so much corruption?

1294
01:55:42,350 --> 01:55:43,980
They've looted the country.

1295
01:56:06,770 --> 01:56:09,850
He had chosen to live in solitude ...

1296
01:56:10,770 --> 01:56:13,980
And I dragged him out of it and got him killed.

1297
01:56:16,230 --> 01:56:19,310
There's no space for even
an ambulance in our country...

1298

what is the use of social service or doing good work?

01:56:54,480 --> 01:56:57,020
I'm unnecessarily ranting...

1305
01:57:01,650 --> 01:57:04,100
I got a text the other day.

1306
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:10,270
Apparently, in Japan,
they mend broken objects with gold.

1307
01:57:10,940 --> 01:57:13,850
They believe that beauty lies in imperfection.

1308
01:57:22,480 --> 01:57:24,650
Is everything ok around here?

1309
01:57:25,060 --> 01:57:26,520

1315
01:57:36,480 --> 01:57:38,270

1316
01:57:38,350 --> 01:57:39,940

Through Deshpande...
His name was Vadiraj Deshpande

1322
01:57:59,560 --> 01:58:01,020
He used to write for Samyuktha Karnataka.

1323
01:58:01,650 --> 01:58:03,520
He passed away at a young age.

1324

has ever worked for this paper.

How did you nab these guys?

1348
01:59:20,350 --> 01:59:22,480
Madhuri's cell phone was switched off all these days.

1349
01:59:22,850 --> 01:59:24,940
Two days ago, it was switched on in Hosur.

1350
01:59:25,350 --> 01:59:27,600
The day after Madhuri died, the phone was on.

1351
01:59:27,900 --> 01:59:29,440
And then abruptly, it went OFF.

1352

02:05:31,350 --> 02:05:33,350
I know where Kumar is...

1411
02:05:35,720 --> 02:05:37,100
I'll kill him!

1412
02:05:38,180 --> 02:05:39,300
What do you want?

1413
02:05:39,430 --> 02:05:44,510
Please welcome our dearest leader Mailur Srinivas!

1414
02:06:02,260 --> 02:06:02,930
Sir...

1415
02:06:04,430 --> 02:06:06,300
I'll just inform my daughter...

1416
02:06:28,510 --> 02:06:31,470
Sir, what if your plan fails?

1417
02:06:33,850 --> 02:06:34,970
I'll shoot him.

1418
02:06:35,100 --> 02:06:39,350
Sir, instead of that,
let's go and talk to Laxman.

1419
02:06:43,220 --> 02:06:44,180
Sir? What happened?

1420
02:06:47,140 --> 02:06:47,800
Sir?

1421
02:06:50,680 --> 02:06:52,180
Why did you stop here?

1422
02:06:53,220 --> 02:06:55,100
What will you tell Laxman?

1423
02:06:59,550 --> 02:07:01,470
About who Mailur really is...

1424
02:07:03,140 --> 02:07:04,680
Will you also tell him who you really are?

1425
02:07:09,300 --> 02:07:10,850
Will you also reveal how Madhuri died?

1426
02:07:20,100 --> 02:07:24,680
I have tried to get my revenge on Mailur
many many times, but I have failed.

1427
02:07:25,140 --> 02:07:27,510
Have you ever tried confessing the truth, Kumar?

1428
02:07:32,930 --> 02:07:33,550
Ok.

1429
02:07:34,140 --> 02:07:34,640
Correct.

1430
02:07:36,600 --> 02:07:37,430
I'll confess now.

1431
02:07:39,140 --> 02:07:41,390
I went to Madhuri's house the other day sir.

1432
02:07:41,510 --> 02:07:42,350
Who are you?

1433
02:07:42,350 --> 02:07:44,300
Lock-up News. Kumar...I'd called you.

1434
02:07:44,300 --> 02:07:45,800
Please leave.
Don't disturb me at home.

1435
02:07:45,800 --> 02:07:48,010
-Madam, one sec...
-Hello! What are you doing?

1436
02:07:48,140 --> 02:07:49,890
You can't barge in like this!

1437
02:07:50,100 --> 02:07:51,550
I don't care....just leave!

1438
02:07:51,640 --> 02:07:52,970
-Two minutes...
-Please get out!

1439
02:07:53,180 --> 02:07:54,850
-I won't take long.
-I'm calling the cops.

1440
02:07:55,050 --> 02:07:56,260
This is too much!

1441
02:07:56,760 --> 02:08:00,100
Mailur Srinivas! He'd given you the
jewellery from Vijaynagar empire.

1442
02:08:00,100 --> 02:08:01,890
You please speak to the cops.

1443
02:08:01,890 --> 02:08:03,180
Madam, please listen to me...

1444
02:08:03,260 --> 02:08:05,430
-A small interview Madam
-Hey! What are you doing?!

1445
02:08:05,430 --> 02:08:07,260
-Listen to me Madam...
-Just get out of here ...

1446
02:08:09,550 --> 02:08:10,550
... Sorry Madam...

1447
02:08:11,680 --> 02:08:13,850
I had no intention of killing her.

1448
02:08:14,390 --> 02:08:14,970
Madam?

1449
02:08:15,430 --> 02:08:15,890
Madam?

1450
02:08:16,140 --> 02:08:17,600
I did not know what to do next ...

1451
02:08:17,720 --> 02:08:19,600
So I just took everything from her bag.

1452
02:08:20,100 --> 02:08:23,220
When I was young,
Fernandes had lured me to the dark side...

1453
02:08:24,010 --> 02:08:27,220
Even after all these years,
I keep trying to escape it...

1454
02:08:27,760 --> 02:08:31,850
But no matter how hard I try,
I just keep slipping and falling back in.

1455
02:08:32,720 --> 02:08:34,050
This is my story.

1456
02:08:34,600 --> 02:08:36,010
I've told you everything.

1457
02:08:38,800 --> 02:08:39,720
Shoot me sir.

1458
02:08:44,680 --> 02:08:46,100
Sir... sir!

1459
02:08:47,550 --> 02:08:48,640
What I did was wrong...

1460
02:08:48,760 --> 02:08:50,390
But please pardon me sir.

1461
02:08:50,680 --> 02:08:52,720
I lost Muthanna trying to save you...

1462
02:09:34,050 --> 02:09:37,850
This white uniform is perfect for you!

1463
02:09:47,680 --> 02:09:48,470
Why sir?

1464
02:09:49,350 --> 02:09:51,800
Are you saying that I'm not fit for the crime branch?

1465
02:09:56,300 --> 02:09:57,010
It's done.

1466
02:10:08,050 --> 02:10:09,350
Not at all!

1467
02:10:09,970 --> 02:10:12,220
You're perfect for the crime department.

1468
02:10:12,390 --> 02:10:13,680
In fact, tailor-made for it!

1469
02:10:17,890 --> 02:10:19,640
You will get used to falling at my feet.

1470
02:10:19,760 --> 02:10:21,550
Don't worry!

1471
02:10:30,640 --> 02:10:32,140
Keep an eye on him.

1472
02:10:32,300 --> 02:10:34,510
If he acts too smart, finish him!

1473
02:10:47,680 --> 02:10:50,350
Why did you say that the white
uniform is perfect for me sir?

1474
02:10:51,390 --> 02:10:53,720
When the police force was established...

1475
02:10:54,050 --> 02:10:56,300
The police uniform was white.

1476
02:10:58,720 --> 02:11:00,680
Whatever colour the uniform may be Shyam...

1477
02:11:01,390 --> 02:11:03,640
...white, blue, green...

1478
02:11:04,220 --> 02:11:05,720
The uniform is a symbol.

1479
02:11:06,510 --> 02:11:10,140
It stands for courage, selflessness and respect.

1480
02:11:10,680 --> 02:11:15,220
But the cops had a problem with wearing white...

1481
02:11:15,600 --> 02:11:20,390
...because of the pollution and dust in our country.

1482
02:11:20,720 --> 02:11:24,800
Frequently washing to wear a clean
white uniform became an issue.

1483
02:11:31,260 --> 02:11:34,430
That's when they found a solution.

1484
02:11:38,930 --> 02:11:42,430
They started mixing in a colour to the white uniform

1485
02:11:48,550 --> 02:11:49,300
Khaki.

1486
02:11:49,970 --> 02:11:50,890
Khak.

1487
02:11:51,640 --> 02:11:53,100
Do you know what Khak is?

1488
02:11:53,930 --> 02:11:55,550
Khak means dirt.

1489
02:11:57,890 --> 02:12:02,640
In a way, all these criminals represent the dirt in our society.

1490
02:12:11,430 --> 02:12:17,720
In order to eliminate the dirt,
we have to camouflage ourselves with it.

1491
02:12:29,510 --> 02:12:31,680
But that's just an act.

1492
02:12:40,140 --> 02:12:42,220
What lies beneath all that dirt is...

1493
02:12:42,850 --> 02:12:44,390
...is complete purity.

1494
02:12:45,680 --> 02:12:47,720
We should never forget that.

1495
02:12:49,550 --> 02:12:50,970
Should we ever forget that...

1496
02:12:50,970 --> 02:12:53,430
...then we are no different to them.

1497
02:13:24,470 --> 02:13:26,600
I won't let you die that easily.

1498
02:13:49,100 --> 02:13:51,430
With the blessings of Mailuramma, ...

1499
02:13:53,850 --> 02:14:01,300
...today I'm all set to become the
Chief minister of the state.

1500
02:15:03,890 --> 02:15:04,970
10

1501
02:15:05,600 --> 02:15:06,600
9

1502
02:15:07,180 --> 02:15:07,930
8

1503
02:15:08,550 --> 02:15:09,640
7

1504
02:15:10,180 --> 02:15:11,220
6

1505
02:15:11,600 --> 02:15:13,050
5

1506
02:15:13,600 --> 02:15:14,800
4

1507
02:15:16,010 --> 02:15:17,100
3

1508
02:15:18,640 --> 02:15:19,600
2

1509
02:15:20,600 --> 02:15:22,050
1

1510
02:15:51,140 --> 02:15:53,930
I don't think I can escape the darkness ...

1511
02:15:55,640 --> 02:15:58,010
Stop! Stop the car!

1512
02:16:08,300 --> 02:16:08,800
Kumar!

1513
02:16:10,260 --> 02:16:11,260
Kumar!

1514
02:16:11,680 --> 02:16:13,100
What happened Kumar??

1515
02:16:13,260 --> 02:16:15,180
How do I face my daughter, sir?

1516
02:16:15,300 --> 02:16:17,640
So I took the poison as well.

1517
02:16:25,140 --> 02:16:26,850
Naidu used to say....

1518
02:16:28,970 --> 02:16:30,050
Look Babloo...

1519
02:16:30,550 --> 02:16:33,890
As time passes, learn to only carry the good with you.

1520
02:16:34,050 --> 02:16:36,350
Let go of the bad.

1521
02:16:48,350 --> 02:16:50,100
My daughter sir....

1522
02:17:29,050 --> 02:17:30,300
Kumar!

1523
02:17:56,470 --> 02:17:58,350
Let's make sweets for the kids today?

1524
02:17:58,510 --> 02:17:59,550
Yes, let's...

1525
02:18:15,890 --> 02:18:18,680
I promised to tell you everything
when the time was right.

1526
02:18:25,220 --> 02:18:27,260
I haven't hidden anything from you.

1527
02:18:33,850 --> 02:18:36,140
I'm really sorry.

1528
02:18:36,970 --> 02:18:38,300
-Hello sir. KS Shyam.
-Hello.

1529
02:18:39,010 --> 02:18:41,640
The video with Kumar's confession ends abruptly...

1530
02:18:42,640 --> 02:18:43,640
Is that how it ends?

1531
02:18:44,100 --> 02:18:44,720
Yes sir.

1532
02:18:45,010 --> 02:18:47,260
It is my responsibility to expose the truth.

1533
02:18:48,510 --> 02:18:49,390
Thank you sir.

1534
02:19:19,720 --> 02:19:21,890
He's out of danger. He'll make it.

1535
02:19:27,390 --> 02:19:27,970
Here...

1536
02:19:30,890 --> 02:19:32,180
Sir, why so much?

1537
02:19:41,850 --> 02:19:42,390
Hello Ma...

1538
02:19:42,760 --> 02:19:44,350
-How are you?
-Good.

1539
02:19:44,510 --> 02:19:45,680
How are you?

1540
02:19:45,760 --> 02:19:48,140
I sent you a picture of another girl.
Did you take a look?

1541
02:19:48,430 --> 02:19:50,720
Mom, please stop looking for a girl.

1542
02:19:51,390 --> 02:19:52,220
Why?

1543
02:19:52,390 --> 02:19:53,180
How's dad?

1544
02:19:53,720 --> 02:19:54,720
He's fine.

1545
02:19:55,010 --> 02:19:55,850
Here,

1546
02:19:58,140 --> 02:19:59,390
Shyam is on line

1547
02:20:04,050 --> 02:20:04,680
Hello ...

1548
02:20:04,850 --> 02:20:07,220
Hello dad...how are you?

1549
02:20:07,680 --> 02:20:08,600
I'm good.

1550
02:20:19,680 --> 02:20:21,470
You haven't come home in a while.

1551
02:20:23,220 --> 02:20:26,760
At least come during the festival
careful with your work

1552
02:20:27,180 --> 02:20:28,640
Take care of yourself.

1553
02:20:30,600 --> 02:20:31,260
Ok.

1554
02:20:43,890 --> 02:20:44,600
Priya?...
