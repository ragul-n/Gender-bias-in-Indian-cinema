1
00:02:03,703 --> 00:02:06,604
My mother is very sick, Doctor.

2
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,231
Bring her here.
I'll examine her.

3
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:14,009
No, she can't come here.
She's unconscious.

4
00:02:14,681 --> 00:02:18,412
She doesn't speak anything.
Please come, Doctor.

5
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:21,544
All right, my boy.
I'll come rightaway.

6
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,411
Doctor, what's happened
to my mother?

7
00:02:50,617 --> 00:02:53,313
You don't have to worry.

8
00:02:53,453 --> 00:02:55,546
Come to the dispensary in the morning
and take the medication from me.

9
00:02:55,589 --> 00:02:56,920
All right.

10
00:02:58,758 --> 00:03:01,226
Doctor, I hope the poor
woman will recover.

11
00:03:01,461 --> 00:03:04,362
Nothing can be said for certain
since she's not ailing from anything.

12
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:06,724
In fact, she has suffered
some great setback.

13
00:03:06,967 --> 00:03:10,368
You are right. May the Lord not
let anybody suffer such a setback.

14
00:03:10,537 --> 00:03:14,906
Also remember that it's important
for her to have enough of food.

15
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:18,374
If she doesn't eat enough,
medicines won't be effective.

16
00:03:54,014 --> 00:03:56,448
Mother... mother!

17
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:01,947
Drink the medicine, Mother.

18
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:23,172
Eat it, Mother.

19
00:04:25,512 --> 00:04:31,109
I know that you always eat
after you have fed me.

20
00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:38,055
But I have already eaten.
I'm telling you the truth.

21
00:04:42,796 --> 00:04:44,787
Please eat it...

22
00:04:59,546 --> 00:05:02,606
Don't cry, Mother.
Why are you weeping?

23
00:05:02,782 --> 00:05:07,515
The one who has made us weep
will have to shed tears.

24
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:51,948
Mother!

25
00:06:53,927 --> 00:06:55,986
Look what's happened to
the little girl!

26
00:07:17,417 --> 00:07:20,511
Hey! Aren't you ready yet?

27
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,714
Come on, get ready quickly.
I will serve breakfast.

28
00:07:23,923 --> 00:07:27,290
You see, till you don't eat,
your mother won't eat either.

29
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,451
I'll come rightaway, Aunty.

30
00:07:46,045 --> 00:07:47,842
Where's Ajay?

31
00:07:56,022 --> 00:07:59,719
Mother looks so pretty today.

32
00:08:03,763 --> 00:08:05,788
Come on, Mother.
Let's have breakfast now.

33
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:09,932
Aha! It's a sweet dish!

34
00:08:12,472 --> 00:08:15,930
Open your mouth, Mother.

35
00:08:22,549 --> 00:08:25,484
Now feed me with your own hands.

36
00:08:32,492 --> 00:08:35,017
Did you feed milk
to the little girl?

37
00:08:35,628 --> 00:08:38,256
Yes, Mother. The little girl
has drank the milk.

38
00:08:38,464 --> 00:08:40,295
And father has gone out
to fetch the medicines.

39
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,831
As soon as he returns
with the medicines...

40
00:08:42,068 --> 00:08:43,626
...we will give the medicine
to the little girl.

41
00:08:45,038 --> 00:08:48,997
Do you know... the little girl
has become very naughty!

42
00:08:49,676 --> 00:08:53,373
She doesn't obey anyone.

43
00:08:58,651 --> 00:09:00,175
Let's go.

44
00:09:01,821 --> 00:09:04,483
I should be leaving now, Mother.

45
00:09:21,608 --> 00:09:22,939
No, Ajay.

46
00:09:25,445 --> 00:09:29,142
You are a son who would
make every mother proud.

47
00:09:29,682 --> 00:09:31,980
You have done so much
for your Mother.

48
00:09:32,218 --> 00:09:36,348
You should be happy that your
Mother has begun talking.

49
00:09:36,956 --> 00:09:39,254
Your efforts have borne fruit.

50
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,758
You too care for her so much.

51
00:09:42,929 --> 00:09:46,626
You have done so much for us
despite being a neighbour.

52
00:09:46,699 --> 00:09:49,600
Not even one's own relatives
don't take so much trouble.

53
00:09:49,836 --> 00:09:52,566
That's enough. You appear to have
become very wise, is it?

54
00:09:52,705 --> 00:09:54,468
I should be leaving.

55
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,615
Stop please... stop!

56
00:11:08,181 --> 00:11:10,945
It's you?
Yes. Where are you going?

57
00:11:11,117 --> 00:11:13,551
I was on my way to Bombay.
But I missed the bus.

58
00:11:13,619 --> 00:11:16,588
Is it? I am also heading
towards Bombay. Come in.

59
00:11:25,765 --> 00:11:27,858
We are meeting after many years.
How are you?

60
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:30,135
I am fine. How's your mother?

61
00:11:31,504 --> 00:11:34,371
Mother is absolutely fine.
How about you?

62
00:11:34,941 --> 00:11:38,138
I went to Pune several times.
But I couldn't meet you.

63
00:11:38,277 --> 00:11:39,938
I am living in Bombay now.

64
00:11:40,179 --> 00:11:44,115
In fact, I travel a lot
between Bombay and Pune.

65
00:11:45,051 --> 00:11:47,246
Ever since my parents have died...

66
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:50,548
...I've had to take on the
business responsibility.

67
00:11:51,257 --> 00:11:52,952
Your parents passed away?

68
00:11:53,126 --> 00:11:56,186
In the plane-crash two years ago
at the Bangalore airport...

69
00:11:56,329 --> 00:12:00,823
...all the passengers were killed.
My parents were two of them.

70
00:12:06,105 --> 00:12:08,665
Tell me, why are you
going to Bombay?

71
00:12:10,109 --> 00:12:12,634
In search of someone.
Searching for whom?

72
00:12:16,549 --> 00:12:18,176
In search of success.

73
00:12:35,601 --> 00:12:39,037
Wait, fatso. I will
pick up the phone.

74
00:12:39,972 --> 00:12:42,873
I am the head servant of
this house. Understand?

75
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:44,976
Why do you answer the phone?

76
00:12:45,144 --> 00:12:48,341
You are unable to remember anything.
You speak however you like.

77
00:12:48,581 --> 00:12:51,345
And then I have to bear with
the abuses of Mr. Chopra.

78
00:12:51,918 --> 00:12:54,887
Go away from here. Go and wash
the utensils in the kitchen.

79
00:12:56,022 --> 00:12:58,820
I don't remember anything?
How can he say that?

80
00:13:17,944 --> 00:13:20,572
I am Mr. Bajodia speaking
from Ahmedabad...

81
00:13:20,813 --> 00:13:23,646
...who deals in boxes, buckets
and tumblers. Who are you?

82
00:13:23,883 --> 00:13:26,374
I am Babulal, the head servant
of this household.

83
00:13:31,591 --> 00:13:36,392
You see, I've to come to Bombay to
discuss about my son's marriage.

84
00:13:36,729 --> 00:13:39,197
You hand over the phone
to Mr. Chopra.

85
00:13:39,565 --> 00:13:40,827
Just a minute.

86
00:13:41,467 --> 00:13:44,197
Fatso, who's Mr. Chopra here?

87
00:13:44,871 --> 00:13:47,396
Mr. Chopra is our employer.

88
00:13:52,145 --> 00:13:55,171
Just hold on. I will
go and find him.

89
00:14:07,393 --> 00:14:09,462
If daddy telephones,
tell him that...

90
00:14:09,462 --> 00:14:11,225
...I will go straight to the
health club from the college.

91
00:14:11,264 --> 00:14:13,255
All right?
Yes.

92
00:14:19,238 --> 00:14:21,968
There's nobody around, and the phone
has been kept off the instrument.

93
00:14:22,241 --> 00:14:25,608
If I am not around for a day,
what would happen of this house?

94
00:14:27,713 --> 00:14:30,807
How are you, Sir?
I am fine.

95
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:35,448
I telephoned to ask you when I should
come to see the girl.

96
00:14:35,888 --> 00:14:37,583
You may come whenever you like.

97
00:14:38,124 --> 00:14:41,560
Tell me, how's your business doing?

98
00:14:41,727 --> 00:14:47,222
Potatoes and onions have
become just too expensive.

99
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,894
Even the tomatoes, chillies
and ginger too!

100
00:14:51,237 --> 00:14:55,833
Who's this speaking?
I am Babulal, the headservant.

101
00:14:56,909 --> 00:14:59,309
What's wrong with you?
You should've told me so.

102
00:14:59,612 --> 00:15:01,477
You're giving me a hard time.

103
00:15:01,714 --> 00:15:04,342
I want to speak to Mr. Chopra.
Give me the telephone.

104
00:15:05,251 --> 00:15:07,776
Mr. Chopra has left
for the college.

105
00:15:08,054 --> 00:15:12,923
Mr. Chopra still studies
in the college?

106
00:15:15,728 --> 00:15:18,822
She's arrived! Here I go.

107
00:15:19,599 --> 00:15:23,194
O Lord Hanuman! If she looks in
my direction lovingly...

108
00:15:23,436 --> 00:15:26,200
...I would make an offering of half
a coconut at your temple.

109
00:15:26,672 --> 00:15:27,866
Move away.

110
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,719
Have you brought my history notes?
Yes.

111
00:15:39,719 --> 00:15:41,914
And I have brought your love story
which was kept inside it.

112
00:15:42,021 --> 00:15:44,216
Love story?
Come over here.

113
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,984
What's going on?
I don't understand.

114
00:15:49,161 --> 00:15:51,391
I'll show you. Look!

115
00:15:52,732 --> 00:15:56,190
I can understand that it's your heart
that has been targetted.

116
00:15:56,469 --> 00:15:59,495
But whose arrow is it which
has wounded your heart?

117
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,308
Not now. I will tell
you at the right time.

118
00:16:02,308 --> 00:16:03,138
All right.

119
00:16:03,776 --> 00:16:06,904
Let's go to the canteen.
You'll miss the pyscho lectures?

120
00:16:07,113 --> 00:16:10,383
I won't attend any class today.
I will tell Ravi when he comes.

121
00:16:10,383 --> 00:16:11,941
He will take down the notes.

122
00:16:14,854 --> 00:16:17,982
Did you see? You remembered him
and he came over to you.

123
00:16:19,191 --> 00:16:22,649
Is that all? I will copy
all the notes of psychology...

124
00:16:22,695 --> 00:16:26,062
...and hand it over to you.
You need not attend the lecture.

125
00:16:26,432 --> 00:16:30,994
I knew that you are the only one in
college whom I could depend upon.

126
00:16:32,171 --> 00:16:34,435
All right, then.
I am leaving.

127
00:16:59,665 --> 00:17:01,223
Where did it go?

128
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,899
What kind of a lover are you?
You've returned after so many days.

129
00:17:04,937 --> 00:17:08,202
Today, you should have been waiting
anxiously for your darling to arrive!

130
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,676
Whereas you've your eyes
fixed on this book!

131
00:17:13,245 --> 00:17:16,237
That's because books are
better than darlings.

132
00:17:17,216 --> 00:17:19,684
At least they don't
make you wait!

133
00:17:21,821 --> 00:17:25,450
Are you angry?
Yes. I am very angry.

134
00:17:27,893 --> 00:17:32,057
Do you know that you've been late
by six-and-a-half minutes?

135
00:17:32,531 --> 00:17:36,399
Please forgive me.
No! No forgiveness.

136
00:17:39,672 --> 00:17:42,266
All right, then.
Punish me.

137
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,310
Your punishment is that till
I continue to read the book...

138
00:17:50,349 --> 00:17:52,180
...you should continue to
kiss me ceaselessly.

139
00:17:52,251 --> 00:17:53,946
I mean... sit quietly till then.

140
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:01,047
I don't like to meet secretly.
I too don't like it too.

141
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:04,485
But what can be done?
We are helpless.

142
00:24:04,823 --> 00:24:09,055
You see, at this stage, nobody should
know what's going on between us.

143
00:24:09,328 --> 00:24:11,489
If your daddy gets even an
inkling that...

144
00:24:11,597 --> 00:24:15,033
...you love an unemployed
and ordinary boy like me...

145
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,431
...he would never forgive you,
nor would he ever accept me.

146
00:24:18,604 --> 00:24:22,267
Don't feel sad. Trust me.

147
00:24:22,574 --> 00:24:27,273
The day is not far when you
will become mine for ever.

148
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,274
And then...

149
00:24:31,517 --> 00:24:34,509
But there's one thing... I don't like
your habit of coming late.

150
00:24:34,586 --> 00:24:38,181
Let me see your watch.

151
00:24:39,725 --> 00:24:41,886
My sister was to have come
today from Simla.

152
00:24:42,027 --> 00:24:43,585
I had to go to the airport too.

153
00:24:43,829 --> 00:24:46,559
It's too late now. She must've
even reached home by now.

154
00:25:02,381 --> 00:25:04,815
How many of you
are there, Babulal?

155
00:25:06,518 --> 00:25:08,486
I am only one, Sister Gabbar.

156
00:25:08,821 --> 00:25:11,221
I mean how many servants are
there in this house?

157
00:25:11,423 --> 00:25:12,754
I will tell you rightaway.

158
00:25:15,394 --> 00:25:16,520
Three.
And you?

159
00:25:17,462 --> 00:25:20,056
I am a man.
You mean you are not a servant?

160
00:25:22,234 --> 00:25:24,259
Boss is always so concerned
about me that...

161
00:25:24,303 --> 00:25:26,362
...I forgot that I am a servant.

162
00:25:26,705 --> 00:25:29,173
You even forgot that the car
had to be sent to the airport?

163
00:25:29,441 --> 00:25:31,136
Why does one have to send
a car to the airport?

164
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:33,435
There are airplanes at the
airport, aren't there?

165
00:25:35,881 --> 00:25:37,178
Did you hear?

166
00:25:40,052 --> 00:25:42,919
Where's Daddy?
He's passed away.

167
00:25:43,689 --> 00:25:44,883
What?

168
00:25:45,924 --> 00:25:50,418
He was travelling in a helicopter.
He was feeling chilly.

169
00:25:51,897 --> 00:25:55,162
So he switched off the fan
in the helicopter...

170
00:25:55,434 --> 00:25:57,732
...and then he vanished
from this world.

171
00:25:58,337 --> 00:26:01,204
Whom are you talking about?
About my father.

172
00:26:13,385 --> 00:26:14,909
How are you?
How are you?!

173
00:26:15,254 --> 00:26:17,916
I am fine. But I am
very angry at you.

174
00:26:18,123 --> 00:26:20,182
Why didn't you come to
receive me at the airport?

175
00:26:20,525 --> 00:26:21,924
I had extra classes today.

176
00:26:22,194 --> 00:26:24,685
All right. But at least
daddy could have come!

177
00:26:24,997 --> 00:26:27,966
You know how daddy is.
He is fond ofjust two things.

178
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,996
One is to expand his business.
And second is to race cars.

179
00:26:31,036 --> 00:26:33,231
He must be busy in one
of these two activities.

180
00:26:33,372 --> 00:26:34,896
I don't want to hear anything.

181
00:26:34,973 --> 00:26:37,271
Our company's production should
increase at all costs.

182
00:26:37,309 --> 00:26:38,173
Yes, Sir.

183
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,375
Speak on, Mr. Mehta.
The workers have appealed...

184
00:26:40,412 --> 00:26:43,142
...to the management that they
should be alloted houses to live.

185
00:26:43,348 --> 00:26:46,681
The company gives them employment
for which they receive salaries.

186
00:26:46,952 --> 00:26:50,752
Besides this, they won't get anything
else. You may leave now.

187
00:26:51,757 --> 00:26:53,782
Mr. Girdharilal's factory is
in our control now.

188
00:26:54,026 --> 00:26:55,323
Go and take charge.

189
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:59,121
Henceforth, this company will be
known as Seema Garments.

190
00:26:59,965 --> 00:27:03,025
A lot of telephone calls have been
received from your residence.

191
00:27:03,335 --> 00:27:05,667
Miss Priya has returned from Simla.

192
00:27:07,806 --> 00:27:09,273
How is my daughter?

193
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:13,102
How are you?
I am fine.

194
00:27:13,345 --> 00:27:15,609
But I am in a foul mood.
Why is your mood foul?

195
00:27:16,114 --> 00:27:18,412
Why did you take so long?
Because of urgent work at office.

196
00:27:18,717 --> 00:27:21,880
I have bought a new garment
factory for Seema.

197
00:27:22,087 --> 00:27:26,251
Now Seema Garments' name will become
a rage in the whole of Europe.

198
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:28,187
And what about me?

199
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,890
You? What do you want?

200
00:27:33,131 --> 00:27:35,497
That's all! A sports car?
All right, you will get it.

201
00:27:49,881 --> 00:27:52,008
What is this?
It's a soup.

202
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:54,610
This is a soup?
It's a finger bowl.

203
00:27:54,987 --> 00:27:57,080
One washes one's hands in it
after eating the meals.

204
00:27:57,289 --> 00:27:59,223
What have you done?

205
00:27:59,791 --> 00:28:02,817
You've placed here something which
is used after meals are over.

206
00:28:03,362 --> 00:28:06,064
What if the boss had gulped it
down thinking it to be a soup?

207
00:28:06,064 --> 00:28:09,261
Quiet! Go and bring soup now!
You may also go!

208
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:18,207
You won't go anywhere tomorrow.
You will stay with us.

209
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:21,902
No! Instead, both of you will
come with me to Madras.

210
00:28:22,214 --> 00:28:24,910
I'm going to participate in
the car race for the final time.

211
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:28,048
But how can I come?
Why?

212
00:28:28,286 --> 00:28:30,516
I've my practical exams tomorrow.
Oh yes!

213
00:28:31,123 --> 00:28:32,522
Your exams are important. But...

214
00:28:32,824 --> 00:28:35,452
It would've been great fun
if you had come too.

215
00:28:35,694 --> 00:28:39,653
Why do you think so? Take it from me.
Think of me to be close to you.

216
00:28:39,965 --> 00:28:43,298
Just see, father. Like always,
you'll win the race this time too.

217
00:28:50,842 --> 00:28:52,778
I hear this is the last time
you're participating in this race?

218
00:28:52,778 --> 00:28:56,544
Yes. Till I continue to participate,
nobody else will be able to win.

219
00:28:56,848 --> 00:28:59,180
Till the number one doesn't make way,
how will number two get the chance?

220
00:28:59,551 --> 00:29:00,786
That's fine. But it
might happen that...

221
00:29:00,786 --> 00:29:03,220
...number two gets the chance
this time itself!

222
00:29:03,989 --> 00:29:06,583
There's a new boy named
Vicky Malhotra.

223
00:29:06,992 --> 00:29:09,654
I've seen him practicing.
His timing is amazing.

224
00:29:09,928 --> 00:29:12,624
He's the one with whom you'll
have a stiff competition.

225
00:29:12,998 --> 00:29:15,626
Where's he?
There he is!

226
00:29:17,836 --> 00:29:20,134
Whether it's a car race or
a race in real-life...

227
00:29:20,172 --> 00:29:22,299
...I don't lose ever.
Yes!

228
00:29:22,841 --> 00:29:25,742
Whether it's a Icky,
Micky, Licky or Chicky...

229
00:29:25,844 --> 00:29:28,369
...they are all pale in
comparison to my dad.

230
00:29:28,447 --> 00:29:29,573
What say, Dad?

231
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:59,037
Mr. Madan Chopra is participating
in the race for the last time.

232
00:30:10,622 --> 00:30:13,557
On one hand is Madan Chopra's
experience...

233
00:30:13,792 --> 00:30:16,317
...and on the other hand
is Vicky Malhotra's confidence.

234
00:30:35,547 --> 00:30:40,075
Madan Chopra... his car is
nearly close to him...

235
00:31:25,897 --> 00:31:28,695
Now Madan Chopra is attempting
to overtake him...

236
00:31:28,934 --> 00:31:34,065
Vicky Malhotra's
self-confidence is...

237
00:31:51,223 --> 00:31:54,488
Vicky Malhotra has suddenly
increased his speed...

238
00:31:54,793 --> 00:31:57,261
With full control over
his vehicle...

239
00:31:57,562 --> 00:32:00,156
...Vicky Malhotra has
overtaken Madan Chopra.

240
00:32:02,133 --> 00:32:05,466
Both, Vicky Malhotra and Madan Chopra
take the leads alternately.

241
00:32:08,974 --> 00:32:13,604
Looks like Vicky Malhotra will
set a new record...

242
00:32:13,878 --> 00:32:16,813
...and Madan Chopra will have
to concede defeat.

243
00:32:59,991 --> 00:33:01,822
I had nearly lost my breath!

244
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,487
It was only when you raced ahead
at the last minute that...

245
00:33:03,528 --> 00:33:06,326
...number 32 was left wondering
about who he is dealing with.

246
00:33:08,233 --> 00:33:11,691
I want to meet the driver
of car number 32.

247
00:33:34,259 --> 00:33:36,955
Was there some technical
problem in your car?

248
00:33:36,995 --> 00:33:40,192
No, Sir.
Then how did you lose?

249
00:33:40,865 --> 00:33:44,767
I've been your fan since years.
I look upon you as my guru.

250
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:48,340
I didn't want you to lose
the last race of your life.

251
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,808
It means you lost deliberately?

252
00:33:51,042 --> 00:33:53,533
One has to lose something
to win something.

253
00:33:55,513 --> 00:33:57,276
What do you want to win?

254
00:33:58,083 --> 00:33:59,607
Your blessings.

255
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:04,777
I like your style. By the way,
where you do hail from?

256
00:34:04,956 --> 00:34:08,448
From Bombay. Car racing
is my hobby.

257
00:34:08,593 --> 00:34:11,084
And it's my profession
to deal in racing cars.

258
00:34:11,763 --> 00:34:14,357
I've been on the look-out for a
sports car for my daughter.

259
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:16,733
Let me know if there's
some nice car.

260
00:34:17,102 --> 00:34:18,660
I am reaching Bombay
day-after-tomorrow.

261
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:21,404
I will show her a car
the moment I reach there.

262
00:34:22,574 --> 00:34:24,439
I want to click your picture
next to your car.

263
00:34:24,476 --> 00:34:25,943
Just a minute. I'll join you.

264
00:34:30,315 --> 00:34:32,215
I'll be in the club-house, daughter.

265
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:35,317
Excuse me...

266
00:34:40,024 --> 00:34:41,821
My name is...
Priya Chopra.

267
00:34:43,161 --> 00:34:46,392
And you want to know why
I lost the race!

268
00:34:48,466 --> 00:34:50,161
For your sake.

269
00:34:51,703 --> 00:34:56,072
Didn't you say that all these Icky,
Micky, Licky or Chicky...

270
00:34:56,508 --> 00:34:58,408
...will prove to be pale in
comparison to your dad?

271
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:02,771
And if this Icky, Micky, Licky
or Chicky were to win the race...

272
00:35:03,415 --> 00:35:05,349
...you would have
been heartbroken.

273
00:35:06,384 --> 00:35:09,444
And how could I break the heart
of a beautiful girl like you?

274
00:35:10,555 --> 00:35:16,357
That's why I said that to win
sometimes, one has to lose too.

275
00:35:17,562 --> 00:35:21,999
And one who wins after losing is
known as 'Baazigar'(a juggler).

276
00:35:27,672 --> 00:35:30,800
What is such a person known as?
A 'Baazigar'.

277
00:36:45,672 --> 00:36:46,136
I

278
00:36:46,136 --> 00:36:46,600
It

279
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,064
It'

280
00:36:47,064 --> 00:36:47,528
It's

281
00:36:47,528 --> 00:36:47,992
It's a

282
00:36:47,992 --> 00:36:48,456
It's a R

283
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:48,920
It's a Ro

284
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,384
It's a Roh

285
00:36:49,384 --> 00:36:49,848
It's a Rohi

286
00:36:49,848 --> 00:36:50,312
It's a Rohit

287
00:36:50,312 --> 00:36:50,776
It's a Rohit R

288
00:36:50,776 --> 00:36:51,240
It's a Rohit Re

289
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:51,704
It's a Rohit Rel

290
00:36:51,704 --> 00:36:52,168
It's a Rohit Rele

291
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:52,632
It's a Rohit Relea

292
00:36:52,632 --> 00:36:53,096
It's a Rohit Releas

293
00:36:53,096 --> 00:36:53,560
It's a Rohit Release

313
00:43:55,146 --> 00:43:56,875
Look! Your dress has
become so wet!

314
00:43:56,981 --> 00:43:58,282
You're talking of my dress.
But I've become so restless.

315
00:43:58,282 --> 00:44:01,342
Why? What's happened to you?

316
00:44:01,852 --> 00:44:05,447
Don't ask me anything. You may assume
that I've lost for the first time.

317
00:44:06,057 --> 00:44:09,117
It was daddy who took part in the
race. Then who defeated you?

318
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:12,788
The one who was defeated by daddy.
Whom did daddy defeat?

319
00:44:13,097 --> 00:44:16,032
The one who won me over.
And who won you over?

320
00:44:16,167 --> 00:44:19,102
The one who lost with daddy though
he was on the verge of winning.

321
00:44:19,437 --> 00:44:22,201
Gosh! Did daddy win the
race or lose the race?

322
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,408
Daddy won the race though he was
on the verge of losing.

323
00:44:24,608 --> 00:44:26,007
But I lost.

324
00:44:26,777 --> 00:44:29,940
You're talking in such
a confused manner.

325
00:44:30,214 --> 00:44:32,478
Why don't you tell me clearly
what exactly happened?

326
00:44:32,683 --> 00:44:34,275
It was a scintillating
competition.

327
00:44:34,385 --> 00:44:37,218
His gaze was like an arrow
which straight hit my heart...

328
00:44:37,421 --> 00:44:40,982
...and I was wounded.

329
00:44:41,859 --> 00:44:44,195
Whom are you talking about?
What's happened to you?

330
00:44:44,195 --> 00:44:46,857
I've fallen in love.

331
00:44:48,432 --> 00:44:50,559
Gosh! You've fallen in love?
Yes.

332
00:44:50,935 --> 00:44:53,460
And if you look at him, you will
fall from the 20th floor.

333
00:44:53,804 --> 00:44:55,533
I'm prepared to jump
from the 20th floor.

334
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:58,275
But let me have a glimpse of him.
Notjust a glimplse...

335
00:44:58,275 --> 00:44:59,572
I will even introduce you to him.

336
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:01,271
He's coming tomorrow to
show me a sports car.

337
00:45:01,312 --> 00:45:04,907
I will bring him to your college.
All right. But bring him early.

338
00:45:05,316 --> 00:45:07,784
Tomorrow, I've to attend a
friend's birthday party too.

339
00:45:12,156 --> 00:45:14,351
Daddy will become mad when
he sees this car.

340
00:45:15,292 --> 00:45:16,316
I have also turned mad.

341
00:45:16,594 --> 00:45:19,791
If you like this car so much,
why're you giving it to daddy?

342
00:45:19,997 --> 00:45:23,194
Who's talking of the car?
Is this the age to love cars?

343
00:45:23,634 --> 00:45:27,570
This age is meant to fall in
love with beautiful girls.

344
00:45:36,614 --> 00:45:38,605
Seema will be glad to meet you today.

345
00:45:38,649 --> 00:45:40,184
We have to meet her at college
at one o'clock.

346
00:45:40,184 --> 00:45:42,620
I've praised about you
to her so much that...

347
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:43,951
...she just went berserk.
I've told her that...

348
00:45:43,988 --> 00:45:48,618
...you're very handsome and that
you love in a unique style.

349
00:45:50,161 --> 00:45:52,797
How many cylinders does
this car have?

350
00:45:52,797 --> 00:45:53,695
Eight.

351
00:45:54,031 --> 00:45:55,933
It must be great fun
to drive it, isn't it?

352
00:45:55,933 --> 00:45:57,901
Yes, it is.
Shall I drive it?

353
00:45:57,935 --> 00:45:59,869
No, you can never drive it.

354
00:46:02,706 --> 00:46:06,198
Stop the car.
What happened?

355
00:46:09,246 --> 00:46:10,975
What happened?

356
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:15,778
So much noise for an ice-cream?
Please fetch me one.

357
00:46:16,087 --> 00:46:19,113
Ice-cream is not available here.
In that case, I want coconut-water.

358
00:46:19,857 --> 00:46:23,588
All right. I will fetch
it for you rightaway.

359
00:46:25,196 --> 00:46:27,790
Please give me one ice-cream.
I mean... coconut-water. Hurry up.

360
00:46:28,532 --> 00:46:31,126
I am going on a long drive.
Yes, I am bringing it.

361
00:46:44,181 --> 00:46:49,016
There's a girl behind!
Don't let her overtake.

362
00:47:15,713 --> 00:47:19,342
Why did you block my way?
Come on! Move aside.

363
00:47:20,217 --> 00:47:22,242
You were driving the car
so excitedly, weren't you?

364
00:47:22,486 --> 00:47:24,647
Does the road belong
to your ancestors?

365
00:47:24,989 --> 00:47:29,722
Her speech is very spicy.
Let's see how she tastes.

366
00:47:36,767 --> 00:47:38,792
Where are you running away?
Let's catch her!

367
00:48:08,199 --> 00:48:09,530
How did you fall down?

368
00:48:09,833 --> 00:48:11,926
What happened? Did
the girl hit you?

369
00:48:12,369 --> 00:48:14,462
Not the girl... that boy
in the jacket hit me!

370
00:48:14,738 --> 00:48:16,763
What're we waiting for?
Let's get him.

371
00:48:25,149 --> 00:48:27,947
The water is finished.
Is it? What do you want now?

372
00:48:28,252 --> 00:48:29,685
The cream.

373
00:48:30,521 --> 00:48:32,216
As you wish!

374
00:48:40,431 --> 00:48:42,524
The cream!
Yes.

375
00:48:52,676 --> 00:48:53,904
There they are!

376
00:48:54,979 --> 00:48:55,946
Come on!

377
00:49:05,322 --> 00:49:09,656
How come you're in this condition?
Why don't you take something?

378
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:14,793
Sometimes you jump from there,
or from here, or from up above...

379
00:49:16,367 --> 00:49:18,460
Looks like you've
come from some circus.

380
00:49:19,436 --> 00:49:21,961
Look... this is a
place for love.

381
00:49:22,339 --> 00:49:25,240
You've come to love. And we have
come to take out your procession.

382
00:49:25,476 --> 00:49:27,637
I see... so you play
musical instruments!

383
00:49:27,778 --> 00:49:29,803
Yes... no, of course, not!
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

384
00:49:30,047 --> 00:49:33,539
Darling... these people
enjoy playing music.

385
00:49:33,751 --> 00:49:35,685
Why don't you sit
here for a while...

386
00:49:35,953 --> 00:49:39,013
...and let me take
care of them?

387
00:50:01,478 --> 00:50:02,809
Where did he go?

388
00:50:04,548 --> 00:50:06,709
Why don't you come too?

389
00:51:32,002 --> 00:51:33,435
Take this file to the court.

390
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:35,301
Can I make a phone call
to Commissioner Uncle?

391
00:51:35,339 --> 00:51:37,102
Are you the Commissioner's niece?

392
00:51:37,141 --> 00:51:42,078
Let me make a phone call first.
Then you will get to know.

393
00:51:42,146 --> 00:51:45,172
You've made the Commissioner
your Uncle to impress a constable?

394
00:51:48,118 --> 00:51:49,949
It's you, Karan!

395
00:51:53,457 --> 00:51:55,084
You look smart in the uniform!

396
00:51:56,393 --> 00:51:59,487
This is Karan. We studied
together in Simla.

397
00:52:03,434 --> 00:52:07,302
I was going and these crooks...
I've understood.

398
00:52:08,172 --> 00:52:10,037
They must've surely
teased you.

399
00:52:10,808 --> 00:52:13,402
I'll deal with them later.
Please come in.

400
00:52:13,677 --> 00:52:15,907
Some other time. As it is,
we've been delayed.

401
00:52:16,613 --> 00:52:19,844
You'd better hurry up. Seema must be
waiting for us in the college.

402
00:52:20,184 --> 00:52:23,017
It's 3 o'clock already. She was to
have to gone to her friend's party.

403
00:52:23,253 --> 00:52:24,652
She must've gone by now.

404
00:52:42,306 --> 00:52:44,706
Come on... open your mouth.
A little bigger.

405
00:52:45,409 --> 00:52:46,967
Just a little more...

406
00:53:57,748 --> 00:53:59,113
I cannot come.

407
00:54:08,892 --> 00:54:10,757
I cannot leave them
and come to you.

408
00:54:10,861 --> 00:54:12,419
Why don't you call him inside?

409
00:54:12,563 --> 00:54:15,999
Whom should I call in?
The one whom you are signalling to.

410
00:54:19,403 --> 00:54:22,566
I was only calling Charlie
to dance with me.

411
00:54:25,409 --> 00:54:27,809
He got the connection
with great difficulty.

412
00:54:31,615 --> 00:54:33,378
I am coming over.

413
00:55:04,815 --> 00:55:07,978
Tell me something. Why didn't
you come inside the party?

414
00:55:08,218 --> 00:55:14,418
You know that I don't like to mix
with your affluent friends.

415
00:55:14,791 --> 00:55:18,659
I came upto the door
only to inform you that...

416
00:55:18,895 --> 00:55:20,419
...I'm going home
for a few days.

417
00:55:20,697 --> 00:55:22,392
What? What will I do all
the while you are away?

418
00:55:22,633 --> 00:55:23,759
Oh yes!

419
00:55:24,234 --> 00:55:27,067
Yes! You make do with
that Charlie!

420
00:55:28,405 --> 00:55:30,202
Why're you angry?
I was only joking.

421
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,504
Come on... let's go and treat
ourselves to some delicacies.

422
00:55:32,776 --> 00:55:34,211
I'm warning you strictly.

423
00:55:34,211 --> 00:55:37,977
The boy who was supposed to have
come to see Miss Seema...

424
00:55:38,248 --> 00:55:39,681
...he has already arrived.

425
00:55:40,217 --> 00:55:44,313
But you lowly people shouldn't
come in his presence.

426
00:55:44,855 --> 00:55:49,349
Besides the Chopra house, even my
image will be ruined. Understand?

427
00:55:50,694 --> 00:55:53,185
And today, I will be making
a special tea.

428
00:55:53,597 --> 00:55:55,565
Special tea for special occasions.

429
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:59,467
After drinking it, the boy will give
his consent for marriage immediately.

430
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:06,406
And it will be me who
will make that tea.

431
00:56:07,177 --> 00:56:10,146
Has your father ever
made tea?

432
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:13,474
Don't mention my father.
He used to make coffee.

433
00:56:15,018 --> 00:56:16,576
Get me the hat.

434
00:56:20,757 --> 00:56:23,317
Today, I will make tea
flavoured with saffron.

435
00:56:24,327 --> 00:56:25,954
It's not saffron.
It is turmeric.

436
00:56:26,496 --> 00:56:28,123
You are in a great hurry.
Shut up, fatso!

437
00:56:36,239 --> 00:56:38,673
He's making a mess of things here.

438
00:56:38,975 --> 00:56:41,375
Over there, the guests are waiting
for the tea to be served.

439
00:56:43,346 --> 00:56:45,439
You see... I've only one son.

440
00:56:46,049 --> 00:56:47,949
Whatever I have belongs to him.

441
00:56:50,187 --> 00:56:53,714
I've three factories. I make all
kinds of plastic items.

442
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:56,959
If you ever need buckets, mugs
or tumblers for bathing...

443
00:56:56,993 --> 00:56:59,655
...let me know immediately.

444
00:57:01,164 --> 00:57:02,961
Wait, Babulal.
Shut up!

445
00:57:04,067 --> 00:57:06,433
And none of you should
come outside. Understand?

446
00:57:07,671 --> 00:57:11,732
He has taken boiled water
to be served.

447
00:57:12,175 --> 00:57:14,905
He didn't even mix tea leaves.
Instead, he has mixed salt.

448
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,677
He's my son.
He's my only son.

449
00:57:20,183 --> 00:57:22,174
Mr. Singhania has telephoned.

450
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:26,280
Please drink tea. I'll be back.
Please go. Business comes first.

451
00:57:26,723 --> 00:57:30,260
If Mr. Singhania needs
buckets or tumblers...

452
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:31,852
...do suggest my name to him.

453
00:57:31,928 --> 00:57:33,623
Make tea quickly.

454
00:57:35,198 --> 00:57:37,666
My son has studied in
the United States.

455
00:57:38,168 --> 00:57:41,968
If you wish, you may speak to him
in English and assure yourself.

456
00:57:44,541 --> 00:57:47,669
My son!

457
00:57:49,846 --> 00:57:51,677
My son!

458
00:57:51,715 --> 00:57:54,013
What is it?
There are no tea leaves in it.

459
00:57:54,651 --> 00:57:58,712
Affluent people make such tea.
Drink it quickly.

460
00:58:07,564 --> 00:58:09,191
Tea leaves!

461
00:58:10,267 --> 00:58:11,461
Tea leaves!

462
00:59:19,736 --> 00:59:20,725
Please come.

463
00:59:21,571 --> 00:59:22,731
Did you drink tea or not?

464
00:59:23,273 --> 00:59:27,642
The tea of your home is like
nectar. What say, Son?

465
00:59:32,482 --> 00:59:33,813
Seema has come!

466
00:59:34,284 --> 00:59:35,751
Come, let me give you a surprise.

467
00:59:36,152 --> 00:59:37,676
What surprise?
Come along first.

468
00:59:41,558 --> 00:59:42,547
Come, Seema.

469
00:59:42,826 --> 00:59:46,125
She's Seema, my daughter. And he's
Mr. Bajoria, and this is his son.

470
00:59:46,863 --> 00:59:48,330
Hello, daughter.

471
00:59:49,532 --> 00:59:57,064
Both of them make a good pair.
Now just give your nod for marriage.

472
00:59:57,707 --> 01:00:01,199
All right. Let's hold the engagement
ceremony sometime next week.

473
01:00:04,748 --> 01:00:08,013
Try to understand my problem.

474
01:00:08,818 --> 01:00:12,549
You know, don't you, that I don't
have any status or position...

475
01:00:12,923 --> 01:00:15,949
...that I can come over to your dad
and speak about marriage with him.

476
01:00:16,326 --> 01:00:20,695
I don't know anything. If you
can't, I will speak with him.

477
01:00:21,064 --> 01:00:24,192
I will tell him everything about
you and convince him.

478
01:00:24,467 --> 01:00:27,300
But...
We have just one week left.

479
01:00:27,437 --> 01:00:30,031
Daddy has fixed my engagement
for next week.

480
01:00:33,443 --> 01:00:38,312
All right. Meet me tomorrow.
I will find some way out.

481
01:01:06,443 --> 01:01:11,073
You may marry wherever
your Daddy wants you to.

482
01:01:14,351 --> 01:01:15,943
What are you saying?

483
01:01:17,487 --> 01:01:19,751
I've given it a lot of thought.

484
01:01:20,523 --> 01:01:23,151
We've no other way.

485
01:01:24,294 --> 01:01:26,819
I don't want any way.
I want the destination.

486
01:01:27,497 --> 01:01:30,057
And you are my destination.

487
01:01:31,434 --> 01:01:33,698
I cannot live without you.

488
01:01:34,838 --> 01:01:37,500
In that case, we have
just one choice left...

489
01:01:38,241 --> 01:01:40,971
...which can unite us forever.

490
01:01:41,678 --> 01:01:43,009
What's that?

491
01:01:47,650 --> 01:01:50,312
Suicide.
Suicide?

492
01:01:52,288 --> 01:01:53,778
Are you willing?

493
01:01:58,495 --> 01:02:00,986
If death is the destination
of our love...

494
01:02:01,865 --> 01:02:04,527
...then I am prepared
to die gladly.

495
01:02:05,602 --> 01:02:09,368
I, Ajay Sharma, am writing
this in full consciousness...

496
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:13,334
I, Seema Chopra, am writing
this in full consciousness...

497
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:17,573
...that without any coercion,
having been fed up of life...

498
01:02:17,947 --> 01:02:21,940
...that without any coercion,
having been fed up of life...

499
01:02:22,218 --> 01:02:23,981
...I am committing suicide.

500
01:02:24,254 --> 01:02:26,484
...I am committing suicide.

501
01:02:26,756 --> 01:02:29,953
Nobody is to be blamed for this.
Nobody is to be blamed for this.

502
01:02:30,927 --> 01:02:32,519
Sign it now.

503
01:02:44,941 --> 01:02:46,932
What happened? Why
are you laughing?

504
01:02:47,544 --> 01:02:50,911
Because you've passed.

505
01:02:53,817 --> 01:02:56,684
Yes! I was only testing you!

506
01:02:57,353 --> 01:03:00,151
I was testing your love,
your faith.

507
01:03:01,091 --> 01:03:03,150
What about this suicide note?

508
01:03:05,295 --> 01:03:06,990
Only cowards commit suicide.

509
01:03:08,164 --> 01:03:12,726
And I am not a coward so as
to give up so easily.

510
01:03:14,037 --> 01:03:16,164
We will get married in the
court tomorrow itself.

511
01:03:16,639 --> 01:03:19,301
You reach at the Registrar's
Office at 1 o'clock sharp.

512
01:03:19,476 --> 01:03:21,637
I will wait for you there.

513
01:03:22,779 --> 01:03:24,440
Are you happy now?

514
01:09:18,067 --> 01:09:19,466
Closed between 1 and 2 p.m.

515
01:09:19,669 --> 01:09:22,695
See? You were delayed and
it is lunch time now.

516
01:09:22,738 --> 01:09:24,262
How would I have known that...

517
01:09:24,307 --> 01:09:26,673
...everybody in this office
feels hungry between 1 and 2 p. M?

518
01:09:27,710 --> 01:09:31,703
What should we do for half an hour
now? What if somebody sees us here?

519
01:09:31,814 --> 01:09:36,649
What can we do? Let them eat food.
We will go for a walk somewhere.

520
01:09:42,892 --> 01:09:48,023
Gosh! People appear like
tiny ants from up here!

521
01:09:55,671 --> 01:09:57,935
Our marriage is so strange!

522
01:09:59,175 --> 01:10:02,838
Neither is there any procession,
nor any celebrations.

523
01:10:05,314 --> 01:10:07,578
Listen... tell me something.

524
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:11,779
What is the gift that
a husband gives...

525
01:10:11,854 --> 01:10:14,254
...to his wife the first
thing after the wedding?

526
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:18,654
What is that?

527
01:10:18,694 --> 01:10:22,027
I knew that you would forget.
That's why I've brought it.

528
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:26,166
Look what's inside it.

529
01:10:32,642 --> 01:10:36,312
It's very beautiful. Just like you.

530
01:10:36,312 --> 01:10:38,803
Is it?
Do you know, Seema?

531
01:10:39,348 --> 01:10:42,249
I feel like placing you on
the top of the skies.

532
01:10:42,785 --> 01:10:44,275
Like this!

533
01:10:44,921 --> 01:10:46,989
Hey! What are you doing?
I suffer from vertigo.

534
01:10:46,989 --> 01:10:48,320
I feel dizzy to look
down from heights.

535
01:10:48,391 --> 01:10:50,484
Please take me down.
I am feeling scared.

536
01:10:52,128 --> 01:10:55,097
Now that you've held my hand,
why do you have to feel scared?

537
01:10:57,500 --> 01:11:00,162
I'm mad that I am taking
you away from your world.

538
01:11:01,170 --> 01:11:06,107
Every girl has to start a new life
after leaving her own world.

539
01:11:11,213 --> 01:11:13,443
And the girl walks on these
beautiful feet...

540
01:11:13,683 --> 01:11:19,417
...and liberates herself
from her old ties for ever.

541
01:11:22,058 --> 01:11:24,549
I am freeing you.

542
01:11:27,029 --> 01:11:28,291
Please forgive me.

543
01:12:35,831 --> 01:12:37,924
Leave me. Leave me.

544
01:12:43,906 --> 01:12:45,339
Please leave me.

545
01:12:47,677 --> 01:12:49,304
Leave me.

546
01:13:33,122 --> 01:13:35,590
I am sorry about Seema's death.

547
01:13:36,125 --> 01:13:39,117
Can you spare some time
in private?

548
01:13:39,662 --> 01:13:41,357
Yes, please come.

549
01:13:48,671 --> 01:13:53,472
Till now we believed that Seema
fell from that building...

550
01:13:53,909 --> 01:13:56,469
...or she was pushed down.
But the truth is that...

551
01:13:56,746 --> 01:13:58,805
...she committed suicide.

552
01:14:02,952 --> 01:14:04,579
Seema committed suicide?

553
01:14:07,056 --> 01:14:08,421
How can it be?

554
01:14:15,865 --> 01:14:18,060
Do you recognise
this handwriting?

555
01:14:21,003 --> 01:14:23,369
This is written by Seema.

556
01:14:23,572 --> 01:14:25,767
But how can it be?

557
01:14:26,976 --> 01:14:29,877
On that day,
she was so happy!

558
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:35,283
And if she had any grief,
she would've surely told me.

559
01:14:35,651 --> 01:14:39,781
I am her sister. I know her well.
Seema cannot do this.

560
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:44,459
Seema can never commit suicide.

561
01:14:44,794 --> 01:14:47,627
Seema cannot do like this.

562
01:14:48,197 --> 01:14:51,064
Seema cannot do it.

563
01:15:05,147 --> 01:15:08,548
I think there's no
scope for any doubt.

564
01:15:09,418 --> 01:15:13,149
If you wish, we will
continue the enquiry.

565
01:15:14,089 --> 01:15:16,523
Otherwise, we will
close the case.

566
01:15:17,159 --> 01:15:19,252
You may do as you please.

567
01:15:19,428 --> 01:15:22,556
I've already lost my daughter.

568
01:16:01,103 --> 01:16:04,470
Why doesn't it enter inside?
Keep on trying. It will go.

569
01:16:13,883 --> 01:16:18,616
This nail doesn't belong to this
wall. It belongs on that wall.

570
01:17:14,810 --> 01:17:15,970
What is it?

571
01:17:16,879 --> 01:17:20,076
Is there someone at home?
What a question!

572
01:17:20,282 --> 01:17:24,116
You blind man! Just put this on!
Who am I here?

573
01:17:24,186 --> 01:17:27,314
Who are you?
I am Prem Nath.

574
01:17:27,723 --> 01:17:29,782
So shall I start dancing then?

575
01:17:31,327 --> 01:17:35,627
We've stopped giving charity.
Get lost from here.

576
01:17:36,765 --> 01:17:40,292
I wonder where from
these people come from.

577
01:17:41,070 --> 01:17:43,903
Why're you screaming?
What happened?

578
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:46,537
I wonder where from they come
to ask for charity.

579
01:17:46,742 --> 01:17:50,075
I threw him out of the house.
You did a wise thing.

580
01:18:03,726 --> 01:18:07,218
Greetings. I've come from
Bhimchand Jewellers.

581
01:18:08,097 --> 01:18:09,564
Is Miss Seema here?

582
01:18:12,167 --> 01:18:15,728
Tell me, what is it?
I am her sister.

583
01:18:15,904 --> 01:18:17,769
She had come to our shop
a few days ago.

584
01:18:17,906 --> 01:18:20,966
She has to pay for some bills.
What for?

585
01:18:21,510 --> 01:18:24,343
She had bought
a mangalsutra necklace.

586
01:18:26,015 --> 01:18:27,209
A Mangalsutra?
Yes.

587
01:18:30,052 --> 01:18:32,020
Looks like you're mistaken.

588
01:18:32,054 --> 01:18:34,648
But she had given the
address of this place.

589
01:18:34,890 --> 01:18:37,256
Look, this is the bill.

590
01:18:46,935 --> 01:18:48,835
What?
I was telling you...

591
01:18:49,104 --> 01:18:50,833
...before itself that Seema
didn't commit suicide.

592
01:18:51,006 --> 01:18:54,237
Looks like the boy she wanted
to marry has murdered her.

593
01:18:54,877 --> 01:18:57,641
Please request the Commissioner
and start the enquiry again.

594
01:19:10,192 --> 01:19:13,684
No... there's no need
for an enquiry.

595
01:19:14,963 --> 01:19:16,521
If Seema has been murdered...

596
01:19:16,632 --> 01:19:19,328
...would you let go the killer
without him being punished?

597
01:19:19,835 --> 01:19:21,564
The killer would be
punished much later.

598
01:19:21,737 --> 01:19:24,228
Have you ever considered what
punishment we would go through?

599
01:19:24,706 --> 01:19:29,200
It's such a shameful thing
that Madan Chopra's daughter...

600
01:19:29,478 --> 01:19:32,003
...used to love someone secretly...

601
01:19:32,448 --> 01:19:34,916
...that she was planning to
marry someone secretly.

602
01:19:35,551 --> 01:19:37,951
If this story is published
in the press...

603
01:19:38,187 --> 01:19:40,747
...if everybody talks about
it in a juicy manner...

604
01:19:41,023 --> 01:19:43,592
...I would lose my face.

605
01:19:43,592 --> 01:19:46,390
Who would marry you?
Have you ever given it a thought?

606
01:19:46,995 --> 01:19:49,361
No... Seema is dead.

607
01:19:50,132 --> 01:19:53,067
Let the pain of Seema's death
remain in your heart.

608
01:19:53,302 --> 01:19:56,738
We cannot let it spoil
our reputation.

609
01:20:24,333 --> 01:20:26,927
No, I won't come up.
I feel scared.

610
01:20:27,202 --> 01:20:30,069
What's there to be scared of?
It's just six feet high.

611
01:20:31,340 --> 01:20:34,468
No. I feel dizzy when
I look down from heights.

612
01:20:56,498 --> 01:20:59,126
What's the matter? Why
did you call me here?

613
01:20:59,535 --> 01:21:02,402
Seema didn't commit suicide.

614
01:21:02,437 --> 01:21:04,098
How can you be so sure...

615
01:21:04,273 --> 01:21:06,901
...though you've seen her handwritten
suicide note yourself?

616
01:21:07,142 --> 01:21:09,508
Because she had purchased a
mangalsutra necklace.

617
01:21:10,145 --> 01:21:14,275
Yes. And a day later,
Seema fell down from here.

618
01:21:14,550 --> 01:21:16,848
And there's a marriage bureau
in this building.

619
01:21:17,085 --> 01:21:19,849
It's possible that she must've
come here to marry some boy...

620
01:21:20,055 --> 01:21:24,014
...and that boy proved to be
a cheat and he pushed her.

621
01:21:25,827 --> 01:21:28,193
Let's assume that the
boy pushed Seema.

622
01:21:28,630 --> 01:21:32,566
But the question is... why did
Seema want to marry him secretly?

623
01:21:34,203 --> 01:21:35,295
Secondly...

624
01:21:36,004 --> 01:21:38,802
One needs to apply one month in
advance for a registered marriage.

625
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:40,432
I've already checked the register.

626
01:21:40,709 --> 01:21:44,167
There's no application in the name of
Seema Chopra at the marriage bureau.

627
01:21:44,813 --> 01:21:48,874
And thirdly, we didn't find any
mangalsutra in Seema's purse.

628
01:21:49,117 --> 01:21:53,486
Now you tell me, did she come here
to marry, or to commit suicide?

629
01:21:53,689 --> 01:21:57,181
If she wanted to commit suicide,
she could've shot herself...

630
01:21:57,326 --> 01:22:01,888
...or consumed poison. But she could
never have jumped from a height.

631
01:22:03,198 --> 01:22:05,598
Because Seema was scared of heights.

632
01:22:06,401 --> 01:22:09,199
She used to feel dizzy
when she saw from a height.

633
01:22:09,338 --> 01:22:14,776
She couldn't even jump from a height
of six feet in a swimming pool.

634
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:22,248
The enquiry is over. I cannot
help you in any way now.

635
01:22:22,517 --> 01:22:26,044
Help me to track down
Seema's killer.

636
01:22:26,822 --> 01:22:29,620
Nobody is helping me
at this point of time.

637
01:22:33,428 --> 01:22:37,023
All right. I cannot do
anything officially.

638
01:22:37,699 --> 01:22:40,566
But I am prepared to help
you in my personal capacity.

639
01:22:41,169 --> 01:22:43,467
Now do as I say.

640
01:22:44,172 --> 01:22:48,268
You'll have to first ascertain
who all Seema met.

641
01:22:48,377 --> 01:22:52,074
I had even asked Seema about the
boy who she was in love with.

642
01:22:52,281 --> 01:22:54,579
But she put off the
question saying...

643
01:22:54,716 --> 01:22:56,183
...that she would tell me
at the right time.

644
01:22:56,385 --> 01:22:59,154
But there is surely someone
who she was in love with...

645
01:22:59,154 --> 01:23:01,281
...whom she wanted to marry.

646
01:23:01,657 --> 01:23:04,922
Do you suspect any one who
could have been her boyfriend?

647
01:23:06,028 --> 01:23:07,655
I don't know about outside
the college.

648
01:23:07,829 --> 01:23:10,389
But within the college,
she was friendly with Ravi.

649
01:23:11,533 --> 01:23:13,296
Who's Ravi?
He's our classmate.

650
01:23:14,703 --> 01:23:16,694
Can you tell me where
I can find Ravi?

651
01:23:17,673 --> 01:23:20,107
You will find him at the
library in the evening.

652
01:23:36,792 --> 01:23:38,726
You are suspecting me needlessly.

653
01:23:38,860 --> 01:23:43,820
I did love Seema. And I also
believed that she loved me too.

654
01:23:44,032 --> 01:23:46,500
But my misunderstanding was
cleared the day when I saw her...

655
01:23:46,668 --> 01:23:49,432
...in some other boy's
company in the garden.

656
01:23:49,571 --> 01:23:50,936
Other boy?

657
01:23:52,607 --> 01:23:54,871
Who was he?
I don't know him.

658
01:23:55,811 --> 01:23:59,611
Yes, I had clicked some photographs
on Anjali's birthday party.

659
01:23:59,781 --> 01:24:02,113
He is there in one
of the pictures.

660
01:24:02,851 --> 01:24:04,786
Where is that photo?
In my hostel.

661
01:24:04,786 --> 01:24:09,746
I will get it for you tomorrow.
No! I want that photograph now.

662
01:24:22,104 --> 01:24:24,538
You stay here. I will go upstairs
and get the photographs.

663
01:24:24,573 --> 01:24:26,131
I will come too.
No!

664
01:24:26,341 --> 01:24:29,276
This is a boy's hostel.
So you can't come upstairs.

665
01:26:38,273 --> 01:26:40,138
Come on. Sign it.

666
01:26:41,009 --> 01:26:42,408
Sign it.

667
01:26:42,844 --> 01:26:45,574
Hold it. Sign it.

668
01:26:46,348 --> 01:26:49,044
Come on! Put your signature!

669
01:26:55,991 --> 01:26:57,720
Excuse me.

670
01:26:58,193 --> 01:27:00,093
Which is Ravi Shukla's room?

671
01:27:39,868 --> 01:27:43,463
Ravi had come to show me
the picture of Seema's lover.

672
01:27:44,105 --> 01:27:46,903
Then why did he commit suicide?
He had lied.

673
01:27:47,475 --> 01:27:49,602
He didn't have any
such picture.

674
01:27:49,778 --> 01:27:52,212
Ravi has confessed in his
suicide note that...

675
01:27:52,414 --> 01:27:55,315
...he was Seema's lover,
and his killer too.

676
01:27:55,817 --> 01:27:59,719
And when you came here with him,
he got scared of being caught.

677
01:28:00,155 --> 01:28:02,817
And thus he committed suicide.

678
01:28:02,991 --> 01:28:06,518
Your suspicion proved right.

679
01:28:06,728 --> 01:28:10,129
Seema's lover was,
in fact, her killer.

680
01:29:21,436 --> 01:29:23,267
Forgive me, Seema.

681
01:29:23,471 --> 01:29:28,909
Alongwith your life, today I've
even wiped out every evidence...

682
01:29:29,110 --> 01:29:31,670
...connected with your death.

683
01:29:32,547 --> 01:29:35,744
Because I'd no other alternative.

684
01:29:37,285 --> 01:29:44,157
I betrayed your love because I wanted
to win your father's confidence.

685
01:29:45,694 --> 01:29:49,790
And the goal of my life
is to destroy him.

686
01:29:51,299 --> 01:29:57,966
And to achieve my goal,
alongwith your death...

687
01:29:59,774 --> 01:30:03,369
...Ajay too will
have to die today.

688
01:30:06,181 --> 01:30:08,206
Please forgive me.

689
01:31:05,874 --> 01:31:11,710
Yes, Madan Chopra! My double
life ends from today.

690
01:31:12,147 --> 01:31:15,548
I couldn't win your trust
as Ajay Sharma...

691
01:31:15,650 --> 01:31:19,677
...but I won that trust by
posing as Vicky Malhotra...

692
01:31:19,721 --> 01:31:23,487
...in the race track in a
matter of one meeting.

693
01:31:25,059 --> 01:31:30,588
Now get ready. It's
time for your downfall.

694
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:40,868
Fatso! It has been six months
since Miss Seema passed away.

695
01:31:41,104 --> 01:31:44,733
But Babulal's spying is
on the increase.

696
01:31:45,342 --> 01:31:50,279
Notjust us, but he has been
suspecting Mr. Chopra too.

697
01:31:52,182 --> 01:31:55,083
One doesn't come across
good people like Babulal.

698
01:32:25,148 --> 01:32:26,809
What's this? What is it?

699
01:32:29,352 --> 01:32:30,910
You drink liquor?

700
01:32:31,188 --> 01:32:34,282
You gave it to me at night
after you'd drunk some of it.

701
01:32:34,424 --> 01:32:36,119
Keep it away.

702
01:32:40,030 --> 01:32:42,430
Where are we going?
To the office.

703
01:32:42,899 --> 01:32:45,265
Daddy wants to discuss
something important with you.

704
01:32:45,569 --> 01:32:50,165
What is so urgent?
How would I know?

705
01:32:51,041 --> 01:32:53,532
We would know only
when we reach there.

706
01:32:54,911 --> 01:32:58,176
All right... yes,
I will get it done.

707
01:32:59,382 --> 01:33:00,644
Come in.

708
01:33:01,318 --> 01:33:03,718
All right. Let me think over.

709
01:33:10,961 --> 01:33:13,327
I want to discuss something
personal with you.

710
01:33:13,597 --> 01:33:14,757
Yes?

711
01:33:15,966 --> 01:33:20,460
Your association with me began
on the race course.

712
01:33:23,206 --> 01:33:27,302
On that day, you lost the race for
my sake though you could've won.

713
01:33:29,212 --> 01:33:33,376
I didn't make you my disciple.
But you considered me your guru.

714
01:33:35,752 --> 01:33:40,621
Thereafter Seema died.

715
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:45,419
I managed to somehow bear it.

716
01:33:45,962 --> 01:33:49,329
But you helped Priya in losing
the grief of losing her sister.

717
01:33:50,767 --> 01:33:52,826
You became more friendly
with Priya...

718
01:33:53,670 --> 01:33:57,731
...and forced her to become
restless waiting for you.

719
01:33:58,308 --> 01:34:03,610
Gradually, you overwhelmed
our lives.

720
01:34:05,015 --> 01:34:08,451
I've understood your every move.

721
01:34:14,557 --> 01:34:17,617
I've got to know why
you did all this.

722
01:34:19,896 --> 01:34:23,161
Because you and Priya
love each other.

723
01:34:24,067 --> 01:34:27,559
And I don't want to become
an obstacle in your relationship.

724
01:34:29,372 --> 01:34:31,897
So call your parents
immediately so that...

725
01:34:32,108 --> 01:34:36,135
...I can get both of you
engaged with great fanfare.

726
01:34:41,618 --> 01:34:44,553
In the plane-crash two years ago
at the Bangalore airport...

727
01:34:44,754 --> 01:34:49,191
...all the passengers were killed.
My parents were two of them.

728
01:34:55,732 --> 01:34:59,532
But my parents are no more alive.

729
01:35:02,405 --> 01:35:03,702
What?

730
01:35:06,009 --> 01:35:09,968
In the plane-crash three years ago
at the Bangalore airport...

731
01:35:10,146 --> 01:35:16,107
...all the passengers were killed.
My parents were two of them.

732
01:35:19,622 --> 01:35:24,719
Henceforth, I won't let you feel
the absence of your parents.

733
01:35:25,662 --> 01:35:27,061
Come on, Son.

734
01:35:29,032 --> 01:35:30,897
Sit on this chair...

735
01:35:31,101 --> 01:35:35,765
...and become my equal partner in
handling the Chopra Empire.

736
01:35:40,010 --> 01:35:42,410
Go and celebrate now.
No, Sir.

737
01:35:43,613 --> 01:35:48,448
Today is an important day for me.
I want to start work today itself.

738
01:35:50,020 --> 01:35:51,419
Bravo!

739
01:35:53,256 --> 01:35:55,781
Let's go.
Come home early in the evening.

740
01:36:34,130 --> 01:36:35,358
Sir...

741
01:36:39,602 --> 01:36:45,438
Sir, please forgive me. I've been
punished for my misdeeds.

742
01:36:45,909 --> 01:36:48,673
Three years behind bars
have ruined my family.

743
01:36:48,878 --> 01:36:52,473
My wife died. The children have
been deprived of their mother.

744
01:36:52,515 --> 01:36:55,211
I've been ruined.

745
01:36:56,119 --> 01:37:00,215
Have mercy on me. Let
me live at your feet.

746
01:37:00,990 --> 01:37:04,118
Where will I go with my kids?

747
01:37:04,894 --> 01:37:07,362
Where will I roam about?

748
01:37:07,831 --> 01:37:09,856
That's your lookout, not mine.

749
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:13,501
I had always desired
your well-being.

750
01:37:14,237 --> 01:37:17,900
I never treated you like a stranger.
I treated you like my own brother.

751
01:37:18,641 --> 01:37:21,041
And what did I get
in return? Deceit?

752
01:37:21,377 --> 01:37:24,210
Excuse me... what is he doing here?

753
01:37:24,681 --> 01:37:30,517
Please forgive me. I am
ashamed of my mistakes.

754
01:37:31,154 --> 01:37:32,951
Please have mercy on me.

755
01:37:33,490 --> 01:37:36,482
I take an oath in the name
of my elder daughter Seema...

756
01:37:36,793 --> 01:37:41,628
I will never make any such mistake
again. Please forgive me.

757
01:37:44,267 --> 01:37:49,967
Please forgive him.
To err is human, after all.

758
01:37:50,073 --> 01:37:52,200
But...
You see...

759
01:37:52,775 --> 01:37:55,710
Nobody would take false oaths in the
name of his own progeny.

760
01:37:56,412 --> 01:38:01,577
Moreover, his tears indicate that
he has reformed. I believe him.

761
01:38:02,051 --> 01:38:05,646
All right. I will agree
if you say so.

762
01:38:05,688 --> 01:38:08,213
Madam...
Why do you have to do this?

763
01:38:16,032 --> 01:38:19,991
Send those consignments
to UGC Chemicals...

764
01:38:23,139 --> 01:38:25,266
He's Mr. Madan, our old employee.

765
01:38:25,642 --> 01:38:27,803
From today, he will
work with you.

766
01:38:28,278 --> 01:38:29,472
Come, Madan.

767
01:38:35,051 --> 01:38:36,848
Be seated, Madan.
Yes.

768
01:38:37,554 --> 01:38:40,022
Not there. Sit on the chair.

769
01:38:46,963 --> 01:38:48,294
Yes...

770
01:38:50,533 --> 01:38:53,161
But the government doesn't
approve of such projects.

771
01:38:53,403 --> 01:38:55,564
It's my lookout to make
the impossible possible.

772
01:38:55,905 --> 01:38:57,133
Do as I say.

773
01:38:58,841 --> 01:39:01,469
And get Mr. Sharma's signatures
on this form.

774
01:39:16,559 --> 01:39:18,993
You've indeed made a
very good plan.

775
01:39:19,596 --> 01:39:22,292
Our company will stand to gain
crores of rupees.

776
01:39:22,632 --> 01:39:25,863
I've always admired your
hard work and intelligence.

777
01:39:26,469 --> 01:39:30,462
That's why I have decided that...

778
01:39:30,740 --> 01:39:34,437
...henceforth you are a five
per cent partner in this company.

779
01:39:36,045 --> 01:39:37,307
Five per cent!

780
01:39:37,480 --> 01:39:40,074
The Company directors are waiting
for you in the conference room.

781
01:39:52,161 --> 01:39:53,651
Five per cent!

782
01:39:54,797 --> 01:39:55,729
Fool!

783
01:39:56,899 --> 01:40:01,893
I've come here to become a hundred
per cent owner and kick you out.

784
01:40:02,372 --> 01:40:05,432
Keep this suitcase in the car
and come back soon.

785
01:40:06,109 --> 01:40:09,806
Yes, I am going to Assam. I've
bought a tea garden there.

786
01:40:10,813 --> 01:40:12,872
It might take me many
months to return.

787
01:40:13,549 --> 01:40:16,347
The plantations might
need a lot of time.

788
01:40:16,619 --> 01:40:18,086
What about the business over here?

789
01:40:18,321 --> 01:40:21,813
Don't worry about it.
Madan will take care.

790
01:40:28,131 --> 01:40:31,726
I have checked the files
of the orders.

791
01:40:32,235 --> 01:40:35,568
Take good care of our
permanent dealers.

792
01:40:35,838 --> 01:40:37,573
Don't let them have any
reason for complaint.

793
01:40:37,573 --> 01:40:38,540
Yes, Sir.

794
01:40:38,608 --> 01:40:43,443
This is a power of attorney
in your name.

795
01:40:44,614 --> 01:40:45,706
In my name?
Yes.

796
01:40:46,149 --> 01:40:48,913
This will enable you to operate
the company with ease.

797
01:40:49,052 --> 01:40:52,453
Come on, Father. It's getting late.
Yes, let's go.

798
01:41:01,364 --> 01:41:06,165
You've given me notjust a
power attorney...

799
01:41:07,470 --> 01:41:14,501
...but the land on which the wheels
of Madan Chopra's chair'll rest now.

800
01:41:32,495 --> 01:41:37,398
Chopra Industries takes legal control
over Sharma Group Of Companies.

801
01:41:48,945 --> 01:41:54,349
You thankless person! You cheated
me despite being under my shelter?

802
01:41:55,685 --> 01:41:58,552
I offered you support out of
pity for your children...

803
01:41:58,988 --> 01:42:00,888
...and you ruined me?

804
01:42:01,290 --> 01:42:04,555
You forgot my obligations
and my sympathies?

805
01:42:06,963 --> 01:42:08,863
Which sympathy are you
talking about?

806
01:42:09,932 --> 01:42:11,234
Three years ago...

807
01:42:11,234 --> 01:42:15,034
...I had misappropriated just
five lakh rupees from your company.

808
01:42:15,772 --> 01:42:17,262
Just five lakhs...

809
01:42:18,141 --> 01:42:20,302
If you wished, you could
have pardoned me.

810
01:42:24,113 --> 01:42:26,946
But you had me sent to jail.

811
01:42:27,049 --> 01:42:32,043
At that very moment, I had pledged
that I would destroy you.

812
01:42:32,088 --> 01:42:34,215
That I would snatch away
everything from you.

813
01:42:34,524 --> 01:42:39,257
You were fortunate that you gave
me the power of attorney by yourself.

814
01:42:39,729 --> 01:42:44,689
Otherwise, for this wealth,
I could've murdered you too.

815
01:42:47,370 --> 01:42:51,568
Go away from here. And
never dare to return here.

816
01:42:54,610 --> 01:42:56,373
After we finish with our
activity...

817
01:42:56,579 --> 01:42:58,444
...please appoint policemen
at this bungalow...

818
01:42:58,614 --> 01:43:01,777
...so that nobody touches anything
till the auction is over.

819
01:43:05,955 --> 01:43:07,286
What's the matter, Son?

820
01:43:07,523 --> 01:43:10,185
They've thrown us out
of our house.

821
01:43:13,329 --> 01:43:16,423
What's all this happening?

822
01:43:17,433 --> 01:43:22,132
To recover the loan that you'd taken
from the bank, we've been ordered...

823
01:43:22,305 --> 01:43:27,504
...to seal all your properties and
bank accounts in Bombay and Assam.

824
01:43:28,911 --> 01:43:32,403
But I never took any loan!
The bank documents in our...

825
01:43:32,548 --> 01:43:35,449
...possession clearly state that
through Mr. Madan Chopra...

826
01:43:35,485 --> 01:43:38,283
...you have borrowed 5 crore
rupees on interest.

827
01:43:39,956 --> 01:43:42,982
The court had sent a notice to your
home 15 days ago.

828
01:43:43,326 --> 01:43:46,159
Since there was no action
from your end...

829
01:43:46,229 --> 01:43:48,356
...the court had to
take this step.

830
01:43:49,031 --> 01:43:52,228
But my wife and children
will become homeless!

831
01:43:52,768 --> 01:43:54,235
I cannot do anything.

832
01:43:55,104 --> 01:43:58,267
If Mr. Chopra wants,
he can help you.

833
01:44:03,079 --> 01:44:06,981
Hey! What's this?
You are weeping?

834
01:44:07,750 --> 01:44:11,151
No, no! Tears will make the
colour of your cheeks lifeless.

835
01:44:11,888 --> 01:44:14,220
You want a house, don't you?
I will give you one.

836
01:44:14,323 --> 01:44:18,054
The royal nawabs and emperors
have made mansions for their keeps.

837
01:44:18,227 --> 01:44:21,060
Can I not give you
at least a flat?

838
01:44:21,397 --> 01:44:26,232
I can realise how difficult it would
be for a beautiful woman like you...

839
01:44:26,769 --> 01:44:29,499
...to sleep on the roads. And
where would you take your bath...

840
01:44:32,275 --> 01:44:34,505
How could you dare to touch me?

841
01:44:35,511 --> 01:44:37,206
I am not a whore
from a brothel.

842
01:44:37,914 --> 01:44:39,609
I am the wife of Vishwanath Sharma.

843
01:44:40,783 --> 01:44:44,742
Ravana and Dushashana too were
ruined because of their misdeeds.

844
01:44:44,787 --> 01:44:47,415
What are you in comparison to them?
What's your status?

845
01:44:48,257 --> 01:44:53,092
Just remember... you can never
become happy in your lifetime.

846
01:44:54,030 --> 01:44:58,057
The curses of my children will
deprive you of your peace of mind.

847
01:44:58,801 --> 01:45:00,860
You will be ruined.
You will be ruined.

848
01:45:01,837 --> 01:45:04,567
It's the curse of a mother.

849
01:45:05,074 --> 01:45:08,840
Your curse cannot harm me
in any way now.

850
01:45:09,946 --> 01:45:16,510
Now everything belongs to me.
And I own everything now.

851
01:46:13,809 --> 01:46:15,436
Please pack this one too.

852
01:46:17,947 --> 01:46:20,108
How are you?
I am fine. But where were you?

853
01:46:20,449 --> 01:46:23,077
I had been to your hostel, but I
learnt that you don't stay there.

854
01:46:23,285 --> 01:46:26,311
I've received a receptionist's
job at Hotel Hilltop.

855
01:46:26,355 --> 01:46:28,619
I live there. Why? Is
there anything special?

856
01:46:28,924 --> 01:46:31,256
I wanted to invite you
for my engagement.

857
01:46:31,560 --> 01:46:33,084
When is it?
This evening.

858
01:46:33,129 --> 01:46:35,495
And you should come.
It's difficult today.

859
01:46:35,665 --> 01:46:38,190
It's my night duty today. If I had
known earlier, I would've taken leave.

860
01:46:38,701 --> 01:46:40,032
Shall we leave?

861
01:46:40,603 --> 01:46:45,370
This is Seema's best friend. And
he's my fiance, Mr. Vicky Malhotra.

862
01:46:48,778 --> 01:46:51,508
Seems like I've seen
you earlier.

863
01:46:52,915 --> 01:46:55,315
You must've surely seen me.
It's a small world, after all.

864
01:46:56,285 --> 01:46:58,776
Let's go, Priya. You've to
reach the beauty parlour.

865
01:46:59,455 --> 01:47:01,923
Congratulations to both
of you in advance.

866
01:47:57,847 --> 01:48:00,441
Seems like I've seen you earlier.

867
01:48:02,518 --> 01:48:04,986
You must've surely seen me.
It's a small world, after all.

868
01:48:13,429 --> 01:48:14,919
Please come in.

869
01:48:17,099 --> 01:48:18,964
A sweet drink for you, Madam.

870
01:48:19,902 --> 01:48:23,065
Fatso! Look over there! Babulal has
forgotten to pour the sweet drink...

871
01:48:23,105 --> 01:48:27,508
...in the glasses, and he's moving
around with empty glasses.

872
01:48:31,147 --> 01:48:34,241
Mr. Batra!
My name is Wadhawa!

873
01:48:35,184 --> 01:48:37,152
Please have some sweet drink.
It's really delicious.

874
01:48:40,289 --> 01:48:42,450
No?
No!

875
01:48:48,063 --> 01:48:48,998
Greetings.

876
01:48:48,998 --> 01:48:51,466
Have all of your friends arrived,
or are there still some more left?

877
01:48:52,902 --> 01:48:54,369
Many congratulations to you.

878
01:48:58,707 --> 01:49:05,579
Friends, Mr. Chopra's daughter, Priya,
is being engaged to Vicky Malhotra.

879
01:49:06,482 --> 01:49:07,847
And on this joyous occasion...

880
01:49:07,983 --> 01:49:13,250
...India's renowned singer, Vinod
Rathod will render a beautiful song.

881
01:53:42,224 --> 01:53:45,159
Is this Chopra's house?
Then is it a telephone exchange?

882
01:53:45,928 --> 01:53:48,522
Please call Priya on the line.
I want to speak to her urgently.

883
01:53:49,064 --> 01:53:53,296
For a girl, nothing is more
important than her engagement.

884
01:53:53,469 --> 01:53:55,334
She's very busy. She can't come.

885
01:53:55,437 --> 01:53:58,964
I've got the connection with
great difficulty.

886
01:53:59,108 --> 01:54:01,235
I want to tell her
something about Seema.

887
01:54:01,777 --> 01:54:03,745
You want to tell about Seema?
Yes.

888
01:54:03,946 --> 01:54:06,107
Tell Priya that Anjali has
telephoned and she wants...

889
01:54:06,181 --> 01:54:08,672
...to say something
important about Seema.

890
01:54:09,017 --> 01:54:10,917
Just a minute. I will forget.

891
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:14,717
It's Anjali's phone, and she wants to
say something important about Seema.

892
01:54:15,057 --> 01:54:19,118
Anjali is on the line. She wants to
say something important about Seema.

893
01:54:19,495 --> 01:54:21,690
Anjali is on the line. She wants to
say something important about Seema.

894
01:54:21,997 --> 01:54:23,487
Anjali is on the line. She wants to
say something important about Seema.

895
01:54:45,487 --> 01:54:48,456
What are you saying?
Anjali is on the line.

896
01:54:48,490 --> 01:54:50,720
She wants to say something
important about Seema.

897
01:54:50,759 --> 01:54:53,159
It's all right. Bring
ice-cream for me. Come on.

898
01:54:53,195 --> 01:54:55,789
I will forget the message.

899
01:54:55,964 --> 01:54:58,194
Didn't I tell you
to fetch ice-cream?

900
01:55:01,370 --> 01:55:04,305
It's Anjali's phone. I won't
bring any ice-cream.

901
01:55:06,141 --> 01:55:09,235
Just a minute. Madam,
there's a telephone call.

902
01:55:13,048 --> 01:55:18,452
Anarkali had telephoned. It's
important to eat ice-cream.

903
01:55:19,221 --> 01:55:21,416
What?
Anarkali had telephoned.

904
01:55:21,790 --> 01:55:23,382
It's important to eat ice-cream.

905
01:55:25,427 --> 01:55:27,292
Anarkali's phone...

906
01:55:32,801 --> 01:55:35,099
What's the matter?
Anarkali had telephoned.

907
01:55:35,404 --> 01:55:38,373
It's important to eat ice-cream.
What? What nonsense?

908
01:55:38,540 --> 01:55:40,531
Have you consumed liquor?

909
01:55:43,212 --> 01:55:45,077
Go away from here.

910
01:55:48,584 --> 01:55:51,644
This old man never lets me
do any important work.

911
01:55:51,787 --> 01:55:53,482
Surely there's something wrong.

912
01:55:53,689 --> 01:55:56,453
Sometimes I even suspect him.

913
01:56:08,971 --> 01:56:10,165
Who are you speaking?

914
01:56:11,373 --> 01:56:14,831
I am Chopra speaking.
Priya's daddy.

915
01:56:15,711 --> 01:56:18,805
Greetings, Uncle. I am Seema's
friend, Anjali, speaking.

916
01:56:19,014 --> 01:56:21,141
Yes, tell me, daughter.

917
01:56:21,883 --> 01:56:24,374
I had met Priya at the
shopping center today.

918
01:56:24,686 --> 01:56:26,586
She introduced me to
Vicky there.

919
01:56:26,855 --> 01:56:32,088
Vicky's face resembles that of
the boy who was Seema's friend.

920
01:56:35,097 --> 01:56:37,258
How can you be so sure?

921
01:56:37,432 --> 01:56:40,595
I've his picture.
A picture?

922
01:56:40,869 --> 01:56:45,203
Yes. He is there in the pictures
clicked in my birthday party.

923
01:56:47,643 --> 01:56:49,440
Have you spoken about this
to anybody else?

924
01:56:49,578 --> 01:56:52,672
No. I thought it necessary
to inform Priya first.

925
01:56:53,649 --> 01:56:56,209
You did a very wise thing.

926
01:56:57,786 --> 01:57:01,916
Daughter, don't you mention
about this to anybody.

927
01:57:02,557 --> 01:57:07,051
It's a matter of our family's honour.
I hope you understand what I mean.

928
01:57:09,264 --> 01:57:12,358
By the way, where are
you speaking from?

929
01:57:17,205 --> 01:57:23,075
All right. Stay there.
I will come along with Priya.

930
01:57:34,690 --> 01:57:37,022
Can I use your telephone?

931
02:02:01,356 --> 02:02:03,654
It's you?
I've come to trouble you a bit.

932
02:02:03,858 --> 02:02:05,120
Please be seated.

933
02:02:09,598 --> 02:02:11,361
Have you seen her before?

934
02:02:13,969 --> 02:02:16,961
She is Anjali, Seema's friend.
I met her two days ago.

935
02:02:17,872 --> 02:02:22,002
Did you speak to Anjali on the
night of your engagement?

936
02:02:22,143 --> 02:02:26,637
No. But what's the matter?
Anjali is missing since that day.

937
02:02:26,815 --> 02:02:29,375
Missing?
Upon enquiring at the hotel...

938
02:02:29,551 --> 02:02:33,214
...I learned that she had telephoned
here at around 10.30 p.m.

939
02:02:33,955 --> 02:02:35,718
I was busy in the party.

940
02:02:35,991 --> 02:02:38,255
On the night of the
engagement party...

941
02:02:38,393 --> 02:02:41,089
...did any girl called
Anjali telephone?

942
02:03:00,649 --> 02:03:02,640
Tell me something.

943
02:03:04,986 --> 02:03:06,886
Whose engagement was it?

944
02:03:08,923 --> 02:03:13,121
It was my engagement!
Ah yes! It was great fun!

945
02:03:13,962 --> 02:03:19,025
Remember carefully and tell me.
Did a girl called Anjali telephone?

946
02:04:04,312 --> 02:04:08,009
If you get to know anything,
do telephone me. I am leaving.

947
02:04:09,984 --> 02:04:13,249
What brings you here?
He's come to enquire about Anjali.

948
02:04:14,155 --> 02:04:15,816
Anjali who?
Seema's friend...

949
02:04:15,890 --> 02:04:18,518
...whom we met at the
jeweller's shop that day!

950
02:04:20,428 --> 02:04:21,895
Seema's friend?!

951
02:04:23,498 --> 02:04:26,160
I remembered! I remembered!

952
02:04:30,038 --> 02:04:33,303
I had received Anjali's telephone.

953
02:04:33,608 --> 02:04:36,509
She had asked me to call Priya.

954
02:04:36,778 --> 02:04:39,611
She wanted to tell you
something about Seema.

955
02:04:40,148 --> 02:04:41,445
About Seema?

956
02:04:44,586 --> 02:04:47,316
Then why didn't you call me?
I was on my way to call you.

957
02:04:47,555 --> 02:04:50,615
But somebody stopped me.
Who stopped you?

958
02:05:11,146 --> 02:05:15,549
Give me two days time.
I will remember and tell you.

959
02:05:17,519 --> 02:05:20,044
How can you be taken in by a
forgetful person like him?

960
02:05:20,622 --> 02:05:22,613
It's foolish to believe him.

961
02:05:23,124 --> 02:05:25,752
Come on... go away from here.

962
02:05:31,699 --> 02:05:35,795
Sometimes I even suspect this Vicky.

963
02:05:38,339 --> 02:05:40,068
I am leaving.

964
02:05:43,778 --> 02:05:46,076
How many times should
I call your name?

965
02:05:47,682 --> 02:05:50,242
When I had come in the drawing room
on the night of the engagement...

966
02:05:50,418 --> 02:05:52,648
...you were speaking to
someone over the telephone.

967
02:05:54,355 --> 02:05:56,016
What do you mean to say?

968
02:05:56,658 --> 02:06:00,458
On that day, it was Mr. Madan
Chopra's daughter who was engaged.

969
02:06:01,129 --> 02:06:05,293
Not some Tom, Dick and Harry.

970
02:06:06,334 --> 02:06:08,564
There had been several
congratulatory calls.

971
02:06:08,837 --> 02:06:11,863
I didn't know that you
will be enquiring.

972
02:06:12,240 --> 02:06:14,834
Otherwise, I would've made a
list of all the calls.

973
02:06:17,045 --> 02:06:19,809
I was just making
a normal enquiry.

974
02:06:20,048 --> 02:06:22,346
But I am sorry for
the inconvenience.

975
02:06:38,499 --> 02:06:40,068
It's possible that...

976
02:06:40,068 --> 02:06:42,935
...Anjali must've wanted to reveal
something about Seema's death!

977
02:06:43,671 --> 02:06:45,798
It has been one year
since Seema's death.

978
02:06:46,140 --> 02:06:48,802
Even her killer has
committed suicide.

979
02:06:49,177 --> 02:06:51,111
But it's possible that...
Nothing is possible.

980
02:06:51,546 --> 02:06:53,514
You don't know these policemen.

981
02:06:53,815 --> 02:06:57,216
For their livelihood, these
people dig old graves.

982
02:07:04,259 --> 02:07:05,749
I was so happy that...

983
02:07:06,261 --> 02:07:09,788
...our love wiped away the grief of
Seema's death from your heart.

984
02:07:11,499 --> 02:07:16,732
But this scoundrel has revived
your wounds once again.

985
02:07:40,461 --> 02:07:42,861
I want to discuss something
important with you.

986
02:07:43,031 --> 02:07:44,259
Come over to my office immediately.

987
02:07:44,432 --> 02:07:47,663
Come soon. I've to leave for the
airport within 5 minutes.

988
02:07:48,202 --> 02:07:49,669
Yes. I will come rightaway.

989
02:08:23,037 --> 02:08:26,404
One gives such power of attorneys
to people whom you can trust fully.

990
02:08:26,674 --> 02:08:28,335
What's the question of trust?

991
02:08:28,509 --> 02:08:31,205
Moreover, Vicky is not an outsider.
He's my future son-in-law.

992
02:08:32,013 --> 02:08:34,709
All right, then.
I should be leaving.

993
02:08:37,785 --> 02:08:39,878
It's time for your flight.

994
02:08:40,421 --> 02:08:43,151
Ah yes! Why hasn't
Vicky come in yet?

995
02:09:17,658 --> 02:09:19,125
Where did Vicky go?

996
02:09:38,312 --> 02:09:40,746
You are here? I've been
searching you since so long!

997
02:09:40,915 --> 02:09:43,315
I didn't hear your voice.

998
02:09:43,484 --> 02:09:45,145
Come along.

999
02:09:47,588 --> 02:09:51,649
After a conference in London,
I'll have to go to Germany.

1000
02:09:51,893 --> 02:09:53,690
It will take me a lot of time.

1001
02:09:53,761 --> 02:09:56,559
So I've made this power of
attorney in your name.

1002
02:09:57,098 --> 02:10:01,228
With this, you can take any decision
on behalf of the company.

1003
02:10:10,111 --> 02:10:12,341
It's time for you to leave.

1004
02:10:13,648 --> 02:10:14,512
Ah yes!

1005
02:10:18,619 --> 02:10:19,813
Let's go.

1006
02:10:28,362 --> 02:10:31,160
I was waiting for this very day.

1007
02:10:32,767 --> 02:10:35,099
You've given me notjust
the power of attorney...

1008
02:10:35,303 --> 02:10:38,739
...but the blank paper
of your destiny...

1009
02:10:38,906 --> 02:10:44,867
...on which I can write the history
of your downfall as and when I like.

1010
02:10:46,080 --> 02:10:48,173
You are misusing the
power of attorney.

1011
02:10:48,683 --> 02:10:52,244
You had better restrict yourself
to your duties.

1012
02:10:52,787 --> 02:10:55,847
I know better what is
right and what is wrong.

1013
02:10:56,357 --> 02:10:57,415
But sir...

1014
02:11:35,029 --> 02:11:37,964
About the growing incidence
of violence...

1015
02:11:38,232 --> 02:11:41,292
...the Police Commissioner of
Bombay told reporters that...

1016
02:11:41,569 --> 02:11:45,027
...the police patrol has been
increased in affected areas...

1017
02:11:45,173 --> 02:11:48,768
...and the constables are being
equipped with rifles.

1018
02:11:49,477 --> 02:11:51,843
In one more incident, according
to the police reports...

1019
02:11:52,046 --> 02:11:55,413
...the corpse that was found in a
huge suitcase at Chowpatty...

1020
02:11:55,650 --> 02:11:59,416
...was that of a female
employee of Hilltop Hotel.

1021
02:11:59,921 --> 02:12:04,449
It's believed that the girl
was aged about 20 years...

1022
02:12:04,592 --> 02:12:07,356
...and her name was
Anjali Sinha.

1023
02:12:19,807 --> 02:12:20,967
I am Priya speaking.

1024
02:12:21,409 --> 02:12:24,537
I just saw on TV that Anjali's corpse
has been found on the beach!

1025
02:12:24,879 --> 02:12:28,508
I know about it. And I was coming to
your home to discuss this matter.

1026
02:12:29,183 --> 02:12:34,177
No, don't come here. I don't want
Vicky or father to know about it.

1027
02:12:34,222 --> 02:12:35,416
Then where should we meet?

1028
02:12:35,723 --> 02:12:40,285
Meet me at the coffee shop
at Hotel Sun-N-Sand rightaway.

1029
02:12:46,167 --> 02:12:49,762
What's the matter? You appear
to be very perturbed.

1030
02:12:51,239 --> 02:12:52,604
Whose phone was it?

1031
02:12:53,641 --> 02:12:56,872
It was one of my girlfriend's phone.
I am going to her home to meet her.

1032
02:12:58,813 --> 02:13:01,281
Come, I will drop you there.
It doesn't matter.

1033
02:13:01,582 --> 02:13:04,983
I will go on my own.
I will go and change.

1034
02:13:22,770 --> 02:13:25,364
Till now, we believed that
Ravi was Seema's killer.

1035
02:13:25,606 --> 02:13:29,736
But after Anjali's death, it seems
the killer is somebody else...

1036
02:13:30,378 --> 02:13:32,573
...and he killed both
Ravi and Anjali.

1037
02:13:32,947 --> 02:13:35,848
But Ravi had himself written in
his suicide note that...

1038
02:13:36,017 --> 02:13:37,951
...he himself is the lover
as well as the killer.

1039
02:13:38,085 --> 02:13:39,814
The killer is very clever.

1040
02:13:40,054 --> 02:13:44,718
He used the same weapon to
kill both Ravi and Anjali.

1041
02:13:46,727 --> 02:13:49,890
Whoever tried to give information
about Seema got killed.

1042
02:13:50,698 --> 02:13:53,633
Ravi wanted to show you the
picture of Seema's killer.

1043
02:13:53,734 --> 02:13:58,228
And according to Babulal, Anjali too
wanted to say something about Seema.

1044
02:13:58,406 --> 02:14:01,273
But then, who could the killer be?
Whoever he is...

1045
02:14:01,642 --> 02:14:04,668
...he indeed keeps track
of every detail about you.

1046
02:14:06,047 --> 02:14:11,781
Anyhow, no matter how clever he is,
he will be caught some day.

1047
02:14:16,290 --> 02:14:19,953
Where did you go? I have been waiting
for you since quite some time.

1048
02:14:20,061 --> 02:14:21,585
Didn't I tell you that I went
to meet my friend?

1049
02:14:22,563 --> 02:14:24,463
What's the name of your friend?

1050
02:14:29,236 --> 02:14:32,171
What's wrong even if I had
gone to meet Karan?

1051
02:14:33,174 --> 02:14:37,873
There's nothing wrong
in meeting him.

1052
02:14:39,380 --> 02:14:41,780
The wrong lies in meeting
him secretly.

1053
02:14:42,650 --> 02:14:46,017
What's the matter? Why do you
go to meet him repeatedly?

1054
02:14:47,121 --> 02:14:49,419
Sometimes at the police station,
sometimes at the coffee shop...

1055
02:14:50,091 --> 02:14:51,319
...sometimes at his home.

1056
02:14:52,059 --> 02:14:55,222
If you're so fond of meeting him, why
don't you meet him in my presence?

1057
02:14:56,097 --> 02:14:57,724
You suspect me?

1058
02:14:58,599 --> 02:15:03,195
You want to know why I meet
Karan secretly?

1059
02:15:03,838 --> 02:15:05,863
It's because of you and Daddy.

1060
02:15:06,340 --> 02:15:08,900
Whenever I tried to discuss
about Seema's killer...

1061
02:15:08,976 --> 02:15:11,501
...you never lent me any support.
And neither did Daddy did!

1062
02:15:11,679 --> 02:15:14,147
Left with no alternative, I had
to ask Karan for help.

1063
02:15:14,648 --> 02:15:16,309
And it is because of him
I've learnt that...

1064
02:15:16,450 --> 02:15:18,611
...my sister's killer
is still alive.

1065
02:15:23,224 --> 02:15:27,024
How could you think of such a cheap
thing about Karan and me?

1066
02:15:28,162 --> 02:15:33,156
You should be ashamed of yourself!
I could've never imagined it.

1067
02:16:20,414 --> 02:16:25,113
The cause of my fury, my envy
and my suspicion is my love.

1068
02:16:26,320 --> 02:16:29,881
I love you intensely.

1069
02:16:30,825 --> 02:16:35,489
So much so that even if someone holds
his gaze at you, I feel enraged.

1070
02:16:38,632 --> 02:16:44,127
And today, for a moment,
I got scared of having to lose you.

1071
02:16:46,674 --> 02:16:51,873
That's why I don't know
what all I told you!

1072
02:16:55,549 --> 02:16:59,815
You are not only my love,
but my obsession too.

1073
02:17:06,594 --> 02:17:08,721
I cannot live without you.

1074
02:17:11,065 --> 02:17:17,197
Never doubt your love again.
I am yours. Only yours.

1075
02:17:20,741 --> 02:17:26,441
Then come... let's dedicate this
evening in the name of our love.

1076
02:22:26,213 --> 02:22:28,113
Hey! That's my friend Ajay!

1077
02:24:23,130 --> 02:24:24,927
Thank God at least you smiled!

1078
02:24:32,506 --> 02:24:33,837
I will be back.

1079
02:24:41,715 --> 02:24:44,912
Let's go somewhere else.
Let's eat dinner at least.

1080
02:24:45,118 --> 02:24:46,551
No, we will eat dinner elsewhere.

1081
02:24:48,588 --> 02:24:50,453
It was great fun!
You danced so well!

1082
02:24:52,626 --> 02:24:55,424
Perhaps you've boozed a lot!
My name is not Ajay!

1083
02:24:56,163 --> 02:25:01,362
Why're you joking? I'm not so drunk
so as to forget my childhood friend.

1084
02:25:01,668 --> 02:25:05,468
You're a strange person. Didn't I
tell you that my name is not Ajay?

1085
02:25:05,872 --> 02:25:08,602
Nor am I your friend.
Let's go, Priya.

1086
02:25:08,809 --> 02:25:11,607
You're behaving haughtily because
you've a girl with you?

1087
02:25:15,649 --> 02:25:20,916
You're mistaken. His name is not
Ajay. His name is Vicky Malhotra.

1088
02:25:21,121 --> 02:25:25,080
Vicky Malhotra is my name,
not his. He is lying.

1089
02:25:25,525 --> 02:25:28,392
What's this drama?
Why're you using my name?

1090
02:25:34,368 --> 02:25:37,394
Hey! What're you doing?
Leave him!

1091
02:25:42,409 --> 02:25:44,809
How can you raise your
hand on your friend?

1092
02:25:44,978 --> 02:25:46,570
What do you think of yourself?

1093
02:25:46,747 --> 02:25:49,181
How would you know what
friendship is all about?

1094
02:25:49,216 --> 02:25:51,707
What do you think of yourself?

1095
02:25:52,019 --> 02:25:54,647
You use my name to
trap a girl?

1096
02:25:57,290 --> 02:25:59,622
I am Vicky Malhotra!

1097
02:26:00,394 --> 02:26:04,990
He's my childhood friend. I've
obliged him so many times!

1098
02:26:05,065 --> 02:26:06,999
He has forgotten all about it.

1099
02:26:07,901 --> 02:26:09,732
I don't want your friendship.

1100
02:26:10,904 --> 02:26:12,599
How can he pretend
to be a friend?

1101
02:26:21,148 --> 02:26:23,616
My parents are no more alive.

1102
02:26:24,217 --> 02:26:27,050
In the plane-crash three years ago
at the Bangalore airport...

1103
02:26:27,354 --> 02:26:31,791
...all the passengers were killed.
My parents were two of them.

1104
02:26:35,529 --> 02:26:39,488
Vicky Malhotra is my name,
not his. He is lying.

1105
02:26:53,113 --> 02:26:57,573
This is not the time to think,
but to take a decision.

1106
02:26:58,118 --> 02:27:03,351
You had come here to
destroy Chopra's family.

1107
02:27:04,257 --> 02:27:06,885
Priya's love was merely
a coincidence.

1108
02:27:07,961 --> 02:27:11,260
Whenever you attempted to
attain your goal...

1109
02:27:11,498 --> 02:27:14,228
...your love for Priya
prevented you from doing so.

1110
02:27:14,367 --> 02:27:19,771
But the day she will know
the truth, she will hate you.

1111
02:27:21,675 --> 02:27:27,113
Your goal is only to
destroy Chopra.

1112
02:27:46,933 --> 02:27:48,867
What's all this?

1113
02:27:49,035 --> 02:27:51,872
Mr. Vicky has taken possesion
of all the Companies.

1114
02:27:51,872 --> 02:27:53,464
What?

1115
02:28:03,517 --> 02:28:05,144
Thankless person! Cheat!

1116
02:28:05,685 --> 02:28:07,846
You usurped my earnings
of a lifetime.

1117
02:28:08,021 --> 02:28:11,457
Who's this Sharma to whom
you sold my empire?

1118
02:28:11,525 --> 02:28:13,152
You've thrown me out
on the streets!

1119
02:28:13,226 --> 02:28:15,387
But you don't know who
you've betrayed.

1120
02:28:15,862 --> 02:28:18,922
My name is Madan Chopra.

1121
02:28:27,274 --> 02:28:32,234
Birds talk about flying. Feathers
which have been cut off don't!

1122
02:28:33,346 --> 02:28:34,574
Don't scream!

1123
02:28:36,550 --> 02:28:39,849
Remember that race course!

1124
02:28:41,454 --> 02:28:43,319
You didn't consider me
your disciple.

1125
02:28:44,191 --> 02:28:48,560
But I considered you my guru
and let you win that round.

1126
02:28:50,530 --> 02:28:56,901
Because that race trophy was not my
goal. This was my goal. This chair.

1127
02:28:59,773 --> 02:29:05,712
Time has come to a standstill
at the same point.

1128
02:29:07,247 --> 02:29:12,742
Everything that happened 15 years
ago is repeating itself.

1129
02:29:14,721 --> 02:29:19,624
Remember that noble person
who embraced you...

1130
02:29:20,293 --> 02:29:23,729
...and whom you betrayed
by stabbing him in the back.

1131
02:29:26,900 --> 02:29:33,135
I am Ajay Sharma, the son of
the same Vishwanath Sharma.

1132
02:29:42,082 --> 02:29:43,743
Do you remember...

1133
02:29:44,417 --> 02:29:46,044
That day you were seated here...

1134
02:29:46,653 --> 02:29:51,181
...and my mother was standing there
and begging for her own wealth.

1135
02:29:52,359 --> 02:29:54,953
This is the same chair...

1136
02:29:56,062 --> 02:29:57,927
After sitting on this chair...

1137
02:29:58,231 --> 02:30:02,292
...you caused the death of
my father and sister...

1138
02:30:02,869 --> 02:30:05,064
...and a state of shock
for my mother...

1139
02:30:05,538 --> 02:30:09,133
...and a life full of
struggle for me.

1140
02:30:11,478 --> 02:30:18,509
But today, I've stamped each of your
belongings with my father's name.

1141
02:30:19,586 --> 02:30:23,113
And though you want to,
you can cause me no harm.

1142
02:30:23,423 --> 02:30:25,448
Because this time around...

1143
02:30:25,692 --> 02:30:28,126
...your condition is like the
handicapped person...

1144
02:30:28,695 --> 02:30:35,430
...who needs a crutch to walk, but
he has no hands to hold it.

1145
02:30:41,408 --> 02:30:44,969
And yes... henceforth...

1146
02:30:45,078 --> 02:30:49,412
...don't dare to come to my
office without appointment.

1147
02:30:58,558 --> 02:31:00,822
In the Bangalore air-crash
three years ago...

1148
02:31:01,027 --> 02:31:03,393
...there were one Mr. And
Mrs. K. L. Malhotra.

1149
02:31:03,530 --> 02:31:05,964
Can I get their address?
Just a minute.

1150
02:31:13,873 --> 02:31:15,465
Their address is...

1151
02:31:39,966 --> 02:31:41,433
Please come.

1152
02:31:41,901 --> 02:31:46,133
I know you've come here to know
who the real Vicky Malhotra is.

1153
02:31:47,874 --> 02:31:50,104
I am the real Vicky Malhotra.

1154
02:31:51,678 --> 02:31:55,079
And the one who was with you,
his name is Ajay.

1155
02:31:55,382 --> 02:31:58,715
The same Ajay who used to study with
me at school during childhood.

1156
02:31:58,918 --> 02:32:01,443
I helped him in
all his problems.

1157
02:32:01,654 --> 02:32:05,920
The same Ajay insulted me
in the presence of others.

1158
02:32:07,193 --> 02:32:09,753
I'm not bothered that he refused
to recognise me.

1159
02:32:10,130 --> 02:32:14,430
But I do feel hurt that he
hit me... he hit his friend.

1160
02:32:15,268 --> 02:32:17,395
This is how he repaid
my obligations to him.

1161
02:32:18,405 --> 02:32:22,205
I don't understand why he is
calling himself Vicky Malhotra.

1162
02:32:25,812 --> 02:32:27,677
How do you know him?

1163
02:32:30,016 --> 02:32:32,246
He's my fiance.
He's a liar.

1164
02:32:33,753 --> 02:32:37,086
And if you still don't believe me,
go and ask his mother...

1165
02:32:37,891 --> 02:32:40,883
...who still lives at
Panvel in Sector 12.

1166
02:33:51,331 --> 02:33:55,791
Chopra Industries takes legal control
over Sharma Group Of Companies.

1167
02:35:45,378 --> 02:35:51,078
What should I call you?
Vicky Malhotra or Ajay Sharma?

1168
02:35:53,286 --> 02:35:55,584
By changing your name and
committing the crime...

1169
02:35:55,855 --> 02:35:58,949
...perhaps you forgot that
changing one's name...

1170
02:35:59,158 --> 02:36:02,491
...doesn't change the person's
face and his crime.

1171
02:36:04,130 --> 02:36:07,497
You threw my sister from the
rooftop so mercilessly...

1172
02:36:07,900 --> 02:36:12,803
...one doesn't even throw
one's toy so mercilessly.

1173
02:36:15,441 --> 02:36:19,434
Notjust this... you
feigned love for me.

1174
02:36:20,113 --> 02:36:23,378
Why? What harm did
we cause to you?

1175
02:36:24,050 --> 02:36:26,484
My father did so much for you.

1176
02:36:26,919 --> 02:36:29,820
He shared all his
happiness with you.

1177
02:36:30,156 --> 02:36:34,991
And this is how
you repaid us?

1178
02:36:35,728 --> 02:36:39,027
If it was wealth that you wanted,
you could've asked my father.

1179
02:36:39,132 --> 02:36:40,861
He would've given it
to you as alms.

1180
02:36:40,900 --> 02:36:44,893
Alms? Which wealth are you
talking about?

1181
02:36:45,571 --> 02:36:47,562
The wealth on the
strength of which...

1182
02:36:47,807 --> 02:36:50,275
...your father was ruling
over Chopra empire...

1183
02:36:50,510 --> 02:36:55,243
...it belonged to my father.
It belongs to me.

1184
02:36:57,517 --> 02:37:02,284
Your respectable father who
considers his daughter's death...

1185
02:37:02,722 --> 02:37:04,713
...as a blot on
his reputation...

1186
02:37:04,891 --> 02:37:07,416
...I know where he has
come up from.

1187
02:37:08,127 --> 02:37:10,095
What did he possess?

1188
02:37:10,930 --> 02:37:13,956
It was he who had come to
our doorstep as a beggar.

1189
02:37:14,367 --> 02:37:16,665
And my parents had
given him support.

1190
02:37:17,070 --> 02:37:21,234
In exchange, he robbed us
of everything.

1191
02:37:22,308 --> 02:37:25,072
He forced us onto the street.

1192
02:37:26,779 --> 02:37:30,078
Imagine what that innocent
child must've experienced...

1193
02:37:30,183 --> 02:37:35,712
...when your rascal father
attempted to molest his mother?

1194
02:37:41,561 --> 02:37:43,256
You don't know...

1195
02:37:43,963 --> 02:37:46,830
...the number of atrocities
afflicted by your father on us.

1196
02:37:49,502 --> 02:37:52,994
You've only seen the crown
of affluence on his forehead.

1197
02:37:54,273 --> 02:37:57,106
Try to pry into his sleeves.

1198
02:37:57,643 --> 02:38:02,080
You will find the blood of my
innocent father and sister.

1199
02:38:04,417 --> 02:38:08,376
Even today I remember the night...

1200
02:38:09,589 --> 02:38:14,925
...when my family suffered the final
blow of your father's atrocities.

1201
02:38:19,732 --> 02:38:22,394
Mother... I hope sister will recover.

1202
02:38:22,969 --> 02:38:27,065
Yes. Go and fetch cold water.
All right, Mother.

1203
02:38:34,113 --> 02:38:38,447
Has her fever come down?
No, it's rising continously.

1204
02:38:40,653 --> 02:38:44,749
All right. I will go
and fetch medicines.

1205
02:38:45,124 --> 02:38:48,651
Where are you going? Hasn't the
doctor asked you to take rest?

1206
02:38:50,530 --> 02:38:53,226
A person who is afflicted
with so many problems...

1207
02:38:53,566 --> 02:38:57,024
...for him, even rest
is an affliction.

1208
02:39:03,409 --> 02:39:04,706
Listen...

1209
02:39:06,412 --> 02:39:07,743
Look after her.

1210
02:39:21,260 --> 02:39:22,989
Take this.

1211
02:39:25,765 --> 02:39:29,633
If it were me who was sick
instead of our daughter...

1212
02:39:30,870 --> 02:39:33,839
...I would've never removed
it from my neck.

1213
02:40:04,704 --> 02:40:06,535
No! No!

1214
02:40:09,475 --> 02:40:10,840
Mother!

1215
02:40:18,751 --> 02:40:20,241
Mother!

1216
02:40:27,293 --> 02:40:30,091
Listen... what happened?

1217
02:40:30,696 --> 02:40:32,755
Get up... get up.

1218
02:40:33,933 --> 02:40:34,991
Look...

1219
02:40:59,258 --> 02:41:02,227
Get up... get up.

1220
02:41:04,196 --> 02:41:05,663
Just see...

1221
02:41:09,468 --> 02:41:11,732
No! No!

1222
02:41:17,376 --> 02:41:21,403
Mother! Mother! Look
what's happened to sister!

1223
02:42:43,429 --> 02:42:46,455
Even today, in my eyes...

1224
02:42:46,532 --> 02:42:50,935
...there's the funeral pyre of my
father and my sister's grave...

1225
02:42:51,170 --> 02:42:56,301
...which are still wet
with my tears.

1226
02:43:00,046 --> 02:43:02,571
You've only been
pricked with a thorn.

1227
02:43:03,049 --> 02:43:05,916
A whole trident had been
pierced into my heart!

1228
02:43:06,685 --> 02:43:09,483
I was afflicted with
three wounds.

1229
02:43:10,289 --> 02:43:11,984
And they were such wounds that...

1230
02:43:12,558 --> 02:43:15,584
...I couldn't heal them till date.

1231
02:43:16,529 --> 02:43:20,021
Do you want to see
for yourself?

1232
02:43:21,534 --> 02:43:23,627
Come... come with me.

1233
02:43:35,981 --> 02:43:37,778
It has been 15 years...

1234
02:43:39,485 --> 02:43:45,321
But her eyes still
continue to shed tears.

1235
02:43:51,464 --> 02:43:56,834
My entire childhood has passed
devoid of love from her.

1236
02:43:59,338 --> 02:44:03,434
She's my mother. I haven't
forgotten it.

1237
02:44:05,411 --> 02:44:13,716
But she remembers only at times
that I am her son.

1238
02:44:27,733 --> 02:44:29,428
I will be back.

1239
02:44:48,988 --> 02:44:50,080
Move aside, Priya.

1240
02:44:51,090 --> 02:44:53,251
He has ruined us.
He's a cheat!

1241
02:44:53,492 --> 02:44:58,054
You are lying. I've got to
know who's the cheat!

1242
02:44:58,931 --> 02:45:00,455
It's you who's the cheat, not him.

1243
02:45:02,067 --> 02:45:04,160
Take her away from here.
Leave me!

1244
02:45:18,584 --> 02:45:19,608
Beat him!

1245
02:45:56,155 --> 02:46:00,091
Do you think that you will be
able to take my wealth easily?

1246
02:46:00,392 --> 02:46:03,361
My name is Madan Chopra!

1247
02:46:07,199 --> 02:46:09,531
Continue to beat him!

1248
02:46:12,771 --> 02:46:15,365
I can realise how difficult it would
be for a beautiful woman like you...

1249
02:46:15,541 --> 02:46:19,170
...to sleep on the roads. And
where would you take your bath...

1250
02:46:22,414 --> 02:46:24,211
Eliminate this rascal!

1251
02:46:28,921 --> 02:46:30,650
Beat this scoundrel!

1252
02:46:34,159 --> 02:46:36,127
Beat him severely!

1253
02:46:41,533 --> 02:46:44,058
Leave him! Leave him!

1254
02:46:44,637 --> 02:46:45,968
Let go my son!

1255
02:46:46,372 --> 02:46:47,964
Leave him!

1256
02:46:50,442 --> 02:46:55,607
How could you dare to
touch my son?

1257
02:46:56,882 --> 02:46:58,941
I've only shot at his arm
as of now.

1258
02:46:59,418 --> 02:47:01,682
But if he doesn't return me
my property papers...

1259
02:47:01,954 --> 02:47:04,946
...I will make so many pieces
of his body...

1260
02:47:05,190 --> 02:47:07,454
...that you will die
picking it up.

1261
02:47:11,230 --> 02:47:15,633
A mother picks the future and
good wishes for his son...

1262
02:47:16,235 --> 02:47:18,635
...not the pieces of his body.

1263
02:47:19,772 --> 02:47:26,473
If anything happens to my son,
I'll make pieces of your body.

1264
02:47:30,249 --> 02:47:31,216
Mother!

1265
02:47:33,919 --> 02:47:36,046
Mother!

1266
02:47:40,259 --> 02:47:42,727
How could this happen?

1267
02:47:43,829 --> 02:47:45,228
No... mother!

1268
02:47:50,402 --> 02:47:51,391
Mother!

1269
02:47:51,704 --> 02:47:52,932
Mother!

1270
02:47:56,775 --> 02:47:58,106
Mother!

1271
02:48:24,203 --> 02:48:26,728
Since 15 years, the blood...

1272
02:48:27,639 --> 02:48:30,608
...which had been flowing through my
mother's eyes in the form of tears...

1273
02:48:31,243 --> 02:48:33,734
...you've broke upon
its floodgates.

1274
02:48:34,480 --> 02:48:38,280
There will be a flood now.

1275
02:51:53,178 --> 02:51:55,806
You had hit my mother with
this very hand, didn't you?

1276
02:51:56,582 --> 02:52:00,018
Didn't you raise
the same hand?

1277
02:53:11,023 --> 02:53:12,251
Where's Ajay?

1278
02:53:26,138 --> 02:53:27,628
Come out.

1279
02:54:15,153 --> 02:54:17,815
Stop, Ajay!

1280
02:54:26,364 --> 02:54:29,595
In the name of your
mother... stop!

1281
02:55:36,264 --> 02:55:36,909
I

1282
02:55:36,909 --> 02:55:37,554
It

1283
02:55:37,554 --> 02:55:38,199
It'

1284
02:55:38,199 --> 02:55:38,844
It's

1285
02:55:38,844 --> 02:55:39,489
It's a

1286
02:55:39,489 --> 02:55:40,134
It's a R

1287
02:55:40,134 --> 02:55:40,779
It's a Ro

1288
02:55:40,779 --> 02:55:41,424
It's a Roh

1289
02:55:41,424 --> 02:55:42,069
It's a Rohi

1290
02:55:42,069 --> 02:55:42,714
It's a Rohit

1291
02:55:42,714 --> 02:55:43,359
It's a Rohit R

1292
02:55:43,359 --> 02:55:44,004
It's a Rohit Re

1293
02:55:44,004 --> 02:55:44,649
It's a Rohit Rel

1317
02:56:26,585 --> 02:56:28,610
Mother! Mother!

1318
02:56:30,622 --> 02:56:31,680
Mother!

1319
02:56:40,365 --> 02:56:42,026
Mother!

1320
02:56:44,035 --> 02:56:45,730
Mother!

1321
02:56:57,349 --> 02:57:00,841
What happened, Son?

1322
02:57:02,787 --> 02:57:09,386
Mother... I've acquired
what was my right.

1323
02:57:11,496 --> 02:57:14,829
I wiped out the storm...

1324
02:57:16,968 --> 02:57:19,596
...which had made us helpless.

1325
02:57:20,605 --> 02:57:29,411
You will have no trouble now.

1326
02:57:29,748 --> 02:57:34,549
What can be more troublesome
for a mother...

1327
02:57:35,687 --> 02:57:42,650
...in whose lap his son is lying
wounded and she can't do a thing?

1328
02:57:44,696 --> 02:57:47,187
Perhaps this was my destiny!

1329
02:57:48,099 --> 02:57:49,498
Mother...

1330
02:57:51,036 --> 02:57:54,699
Today... after many years...

1331
02:57:56,341 --> 02:58:00,107
I am finding it very soothing
in your lap.

1332
02:58:00,745 --> 02:58:05,307
Mother... envelop me
in your arms.

1333
02:58:06,217 --> 02:58:08,583
Hide me in your embrace.

1334
02:58:09,287 --> 02:58:16,216
Mother, I've been yearning
for your love since childhood.

1335
02:58:17,495 --> 02:58:22,558
I want to sleep peacefully now.

1336
02:58:24,369 --> 02:58:27,668
I want to sleep peacefully...

1337
02:58:29,074 --> 02:58:31,440
Yes, sleep...

1338
02:58:32,110 --> 02:58:35,102
