I can manage to put only 10 paise into this box.

I've put the papads out to dry in the sun.

Who is it? Is it Kempi?

14
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,715
Yes.

15
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,565
Since yesterday night, I'm burning up.

16
00:01:33,031 --> 00:01:34,086
Cold.

17
00:01:34,245 --> 00:01:35,745
You're always in the water.

18
00:01:35,912 --> 00:01:37,301
How did you get the cold?

19
00:01:37,326 --> 00:01:38,821
Poor like us,

20
00:01:38,924 --> 00:01:40,154
get only cold.

21
00:01:40,385 --> 00:01:44,171
Put any amount of water in this milk, one wouldn't know.

22
00:01:44,412 --> 00:01:48,745
But put a little water on the head and it leaks out of nose.

23
00:01:48,917 --> 00:01:49,798
But tell me...

24
00:01:49,837 --> 00:01:52,226
Why did you come to deliver the milk in this state?

25
00:01:52,251 --> 00:01:53,062
Madam,

26
00:01:53,207 --> 00:01:54,596
...without missing a day,

27
00:01:54,718 --> 00:01:56,781
...if I deliver milk,

28
00:01:56,892 --> 00:02:01,202
...I hope I would one day be able to bear a child.

29
00:02:01,716 --> 00:02:02,597
Don't worry.

30
00:02:03,147 --> 00:02:05,171
Udupi Krishna will definitely bless you one day.

31
00:02:05,331 --> 00:02:07,291
When will he?

32
00:02:10,591 --> 00:02:14,194
I get all kinds of aches in my body.

33
00:02:14,506 --> 00:02:18,815
Except for that ache in the waist.

34
00:02:19,655 --> 00:02:21,337
Kempi, here's your money.

35
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,125
Count them.

36
00:02:23,256 --> 00:02:24,891
It'll be right.

37
00:02:25,091 --> 00:02:28,417
Quarter of a litre a day for 30 days is 7.5 litres.

38
00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:30,108
How much more would you even buy?

39
00:02:30,326 --> 00:02:30,905
Kempi.

40
00:02:31,421 --> 00:02:33,431
One must stretch the legs only as much as the bed allows.

41
00:02:33,456 --> 00:02:34,354
Even this milk...

42
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,235
...is bought only for my husband.

43
00:03:10,026 --> 00:03:11,050

44
00:03:11,075 --> 00:03:12,677

45
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:17,108

So, I'll just choose whatever I please.

I'll get hold of his hair and get my prize this time.

64

I've written it so beautifully, you know?

65
00:04:07,977 --> 00:04:11,262
You won't get it just because you wrote.

66
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,060
Do one thing.

67
00:04:13,436 --> 00:04:17,825

69

You idiot.

70
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,024
I've already tried these offerings and box money tricks a thousand times.

71
00:04:25,135 --> 00:04:27,214
And I've blown them away just like that.

72
00:04:27,799 --> 00:04:30,760
God doesn't pay attention to guys like us.

73
00:04:30,866 --> 00:04:31,851
Know it all!

74
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:36,049
Just because you didn't get what you prayed for,
won't anybody in the world get anything?

75
00:04:36,547 --> 00:04:38,063
Did you read yesterday's newspaper?

76
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,930
Some rich man...

77
00:04:41,184 --> 00:04:43,978
put 50,000 rupees into Tirupati temple donation box.

78
00:04:44,802 --> 00:04:46,175
Without getting what he wanted...

79
00:04:46,373 --> 00:04:49,627
...is he a fool to put so much money into the box?

80
00:04:49,894 --> 00:04:51,767
Listen to me, oh gullible idiot!

81
00:04:52,263 --> 00:04:56,572
Imagine you would get one rupee for doing a man's job.

82
00:04:56,775 --> 00:05:01,084
And imagine you'd get 10 rupees for doing the same job for another.

83
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:03,272
Whose job would you do?

84
00:05:03,297 --> 00:05:06,172
Who would let go of the more profitable one?

85
00:05:06,508 --> 00:05:08,532
I'll do the 10 rupee job.

86
00:05:08,557 --> 00:05:09,986
Your god is also like that.

87
00:05:10,417 --> 00:05:12,750
If god granted what the rich man wished,

88
00:05:12,838 --> 00:05:14,608
god gets 50,000 rupees in the box.

89
00:05:14,991 --> 00:05:17,690
If he grants what this poor Maadhuraya prayed for,

90
00:05:17,868 --> 00:05:19,479
he would only get 5 rupees.

91
00:05:19,893 --> 00:05:20,965
Your Paramathma,

92
00:05:21,031 --> 00:05:24,047
would he choose 5 rupees or 50,000 rupees?

93
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:25,462
Listen Giri.

94
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,653
Don't think I'm an atheist.

95
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,498
To me my conscience is god.

96
00:05:29,777 --> 00:05:31,841
I've contested putting my faith on my conscience.

97
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:34,462
I'll definitely win this time.

Can't you see?

105
00:06:15,755 --> 00:06:16,936
Can't you see?

106
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:18,248
Let it go.

107
00:06:19,211 --> 00:06:20,330
Why?

108
00:06:20,355 --> 00:06:22,061
You dare put your hand on the girl?

109
00:06:22,713 --> 00:06:26,681
In my restaurant, boys and girls are treated the same.

110
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:30,646
You had to exercise on me to digest your food?

111
00:06:45,463 --> 00:06:47,011
Your time is bad.

112
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:49,758
I can see that.

113
00:06:52,862 --> 00:06:55,260
Your time is bad too.

114
00:07:27,557 --> 00:07:30,874
Oh, my money is gone.

115
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,578
Your time is very good.

116
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:35,843
And mine?

117
00:07:35,868 --> 00:07:37,993
Yours? Not good at all.

118
00:07:39,308 --> 00:07:40,252
It's gone.

119
00:07:40,483 --> 00:07:41,633
My business is ruined.

120
00:07:41,826 --> 00:07:43,564
The cash from the register is gone.

121
00:07:44,273 --> 00:07:45,440
Sir.

122
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:48,170
Did you see how I taught those delinquents a lesson?

123
00:07:48,366 --> 00:07:50,581
Yes, yes. You taught them.

124
00:07:50,747 --> 00:07:53,136
No one would dare to pick fights here in future.

125
00:07:53,295 --> 00:07:53,724
Yes.

126
00:07:53,997 --> 00:07:56,410
Nobody would come to our restaurant any more.

127
00:07:56,682 --> 00:08:00,587
What good have you done, Muddukrishna?

128
00:08:00,909 --> 00:08:02,313
People ran away without paying.

129
00:08:02,467 --> 00:08:04,094
That's 25 rupees.

130
00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:06,929
People who would've come, didn't come.

131
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,274
That's another 100 rupees loss.

132
00:08:09,299 --> 00:08:14,860
All the food that's prepared and the broken furniture costs about 300 rupees.

133
00:08:14,885 --> 00:08:19,735
Even if I forget them, some 360 rupees cash from the register is gone.

134
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:24,318
If I add them all up, it totals about 785 rupees.

135
00:08:24,351 --> 00:08:27,039
I don't want to know anything.

136
00:08:27,064 --> 00:08:32,707
You'll pay me back this money by working for 2 years, 4 months and 1 week.

137
00:08:32,732 --> 00:08:38,769
Now go to the accountant and sign a voucher saying you've borrowed 785 rupees from me.

138
00:08:38,794 --> 00:08:39,777
Do you understand?

139
00:08:39,802 --> 00:08:40,650
Sir.

140
00:08:40,675 --> 00:08:43,674
I did all this to help you and your daughter.

141
00:08:43,699 --> 00:08:45,438
Who asked you to?

142
00:08:45,601 --> 00:08:48,275
There's law and police. You must have informed them.

143
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,255
Why did you take the law into your hands?

144
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,414
Go now.

145
00:08:52,903 --> 00:08:54,292
I said go.

146
00:08:54,317 --> 00:08:55,522
You keep quiet.

147
00:08:56,705 --> 00:09:00,769
Why did you come here with your friends during your classes?

148
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,301
What is this Ambuja?

149
00:09:11,707 --> 00:09:13,652
Your Krishna is coming today?

150
00:09:14,131 --> 00:09:16,012
What's the arrival time?

151
00:09:16,418 --> 00:09:17,791
Is it 6 P.M?

152
00:09:18,326 --> 00:09:20,699
Would he come in a car or an auto-rickshaw?

153
00:09:21,138 --> 00:09:24,781
Or would he come on a bicycle because the petrol is costly?

154
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:26,667
He would come on Garuda blowing his conch.

155
00:09:26,787 --> 00:09:29,128
Stand aside. I have to draw Krishna's feet.

156
00:09:29,153 --> 00:09:31,592
Why do you struggle so much to draw the feet?

157
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:33,466
Bring a bucketful of batter.

158
00:09:33,491 --> 00:09:36,442
I'll stick my feet in it and walk all over.

159
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:40,922
Whose feet do you think I'm drawing? Krishna's or Kamsa's?

160
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,133
How does it matter?

161
00:09:42,158 --> 00:09:47,109
Ambuja, even if you book a trunk call to Vaikunta, he won't come.

162
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:48,664
Why won't he come?

163
00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:51,872
If we call him with true devotion,

164
00:09:52,732 --> 00:09:55,034
...he'll come to this poor man's house too.

165
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:56,838
Oh? He would come.

166
00:09:57,072 --> 00:09:59,191
Didn't I have true devotion before?

167
00:09:59,509 --> 00:10:00,763
What did he do for me?

168
00:10:01,862 --> 00:10:03,354
My son Muddukrishna...

169
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,521
To make him an educated man, we worked hard.

170
00:10:08,795 --> 00:10:10,382
Did he[God] show even a bit of compassion towards us?

171
00:10:10,415 --> 00:10:13,797
Krishna, Protector, Saviour of the orphaned, they call him.

172
00:10:14,477 --> 00:10:16,144
He isn't worth a cent for the needy.

173
00:10:16,169 --> 00:10:18,066
But he has thousands.

174
00:10:18,308 --> 00:10:20,038
Krishna has only two wives.

175
00:10:20,214 --> 00:10:22,651
You say that he has thousands of them.

176
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:24,796
I didn't talk about the women.

177
00:10:24,941 --> 00:10:27,147
I said he has thousands of names.

178
00:10:27,172 --> 00:10:28,960
I'm talking about the Sahasranama.

179
00:10:29,168 --> 00:10:30,088
Look here.

180
00:10:30,408 --> 00:10:36,670
I never pray to him for jewels or clothes or anything.

181
00:10:37,446 --> 00:10:43,581
This mangalasutra must remain intact is what I pray to him.

182
00:10:44,486 --> 00:10:49,383
In this matter, Krishna has truly blessed me.

183
00:10:49,408 --> 00:10:51,024
Let it go, Ambuja.

184
00:10:51,383 --> 00:10:54,525
Have you prepared dirt with butter for your Krishna?

185
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,195
Why dirt?

186
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,506
Don't you know?

187
00:10:56,594 --> 00:10:58,071
When your Krishna comes...

188
00:10:58,127 --> 00:10:59,611
Put some dirt in his mouth.

189
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:01,478
Hear me out.

190
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,576
You can see the whole universe in his mouth then.

191
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:06,261
He's like an old model television.

192
00:11:06,286 --> 00:11:07,239
Krishna, Krishna.

193
00:11:07,456 --> 00:11:08,805
Keep making fun.

194
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:13,138
To him, naughty people like you and devoted people like me are the same.

195
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:16,729
You keep offering him sweets and I will keep making fun of him.

196
00:11:16,754 --> 00:11:19,208
I too will see what he will do.

197
00:11:19,634 --> 00:11:20,452
I'll be back.

198
00:11:20,563 --> 00:11:21,682
Going for the sweets?

199
00:11:21,874 --> 00:11:23,358
I'll bring some.

200
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:34,520
She has drawn only Krishna's feet entering.

201
00:11:34,745 --> 00:11:36,340
I'll draw his feet leaving.

202
00:11:49,118 --> 00:11:52,054
Krishna you leave quickly.[A joke on song 'Krishna nee begane baro']

203
00:11:52,318 --> 00:11:54,762
What is this father? You're drawing Krishna's feet?

204
00:11:54,787 --> 00:11:56,046
What's the big deal in it?

205
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,617
Just write an eight and draw 5 small zeroes above it. That's all.

206
00:12:00,122 --> 00:12:01,503
That's alright.

207
00:12:01,528 --> 00:12:05,346
But every year Krishna's feet remains the same. Won't they grow?

208
00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:06,985
Won't he grow?

209
00:12:07,107 --> 00:12:11,202
Muddukrishna, great men remain the same all the time.

210
00:12:11,432 --> 00:12:13,353
Our God Krishna is also like that.

211
00:12:13,438 --> 00:12:15,461
Forget your Paramathma.

212
00:12:15,653 --> 00:12:18,089
Let's ask our son what he's up to.

213
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:22,252
What happened to that railway canteen job?

214
00:12:22,344 --> 00:12:23,653
Did you go meet them?

215
00:12:23,678 --> 00:12:25,241
I came straight home from there.

216
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:26,617
What all did they ask?

217
00:12:26,642 --> 00:12:29,007
They asked me some things about railways.

218
00:12:29,201 --> 00:12:31,185
They asked me what is fish plate.

219
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,646
I told them it's a plate of fish.

220
00:12:32,671 --> 00:12:33,433
Krishna.

221
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:35,427
Question itself is dizzying.

222
00:12:35,452 --> 00:12:37,880
They asked me what is a signal.

223
00:12:37,905 --> 00:12:40,098
I told them it's a toothpaste.

224
00:12:40,123 --> 00:12:41,147
Very good.

225
00:12:41,172 --> 00:12:44,275
They asked me what does red light indicate?

226
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:47,661
I told them that it's an area in Bombay where a particular sort of girls live.

227
00:12:47,974 --> 00:12:49,244
Smart brain.

228
00:12:49,332 --> 00:12:52,221
How did you get to know things even I don't know?

229
00:12:52,246 --> 00:12:53,312
He knows everything.

230
00:12:53,908 --> 00:12:57,416
Poor child has gone to great lengths to learn all that he can.

231
00:12:57,873 --> 00:13:00,675
If you don't know something, ask him and learn.

232
00:13:00,955 --> 00:13:01,773
Then...

233
00:13:01,813 --> 00:13:02,479
Then?

234
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,132
They asked me where does the Bangalore mail run?

235
00:13:05,372 --> 00:13:07,197
I said I don't know where it's running now.

236
00:13:07,222 --> 00:13:12,055
But five years ago it ran in Menaka, Bharat and Gopal theatres.

237
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,520
My dearest.

238
00:13:13,954 --> 00:13:16,771
You were scolding him for watching too many films.

239
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:19,758
Now you see where it helped him?

240
00:13:19,783 --> 00:13:20,205
Amma...

241
00:13:20,555 --> 00:13:22,777
They asked me what is departure.

242
00:13:22,961 --> 00:13:24,128
I said leaving.

243
00:13:24,465 --> 00:13:26,147
They said I could leave.

244
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:27,346
And I came.

245
00:13:27,778 --> 00:13:30,651
Did you ask them when should you visit them again?

246
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:32,178
Why should he ask?

247
00:13:32,401 --> 00:13:36,735
He has answered them like 'that'.

248
00:13:37,074 --> 00:13:39,161
Appointment order will come here.

249
00:13:39,742 --> 00:13:40,734
You come dear.

250
00:13:41,434 --> 00:13:44,077
You too come. We shall offer some to God and then eat.

251
00:13:46,931 --> 00:13:47,804
What is this?

252
00:13:48,034 --> 00:13:50,534
She seems to be ordering me around.

253
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,450
Isn't mother your superior?

254
00:13:52,953 --> 00:13:54,040
Yes.

255
00:13:54,381 --> 00:13:57,342
Women are superior in all households now.

256
00:13:57,393 --> 00:13:58,504
-Appa.
-Huh?

257
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,910
Madam's husband.

258
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,449
The name sticks to me.

259
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,106
Sorry.

260
00:14:11,471 --> 00:14:13,003
I must apologise to you.

261
00:14:13,209 --> 00:14:15,368
You are masters.

262
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,302
Coming on wrong side is your right.

263
00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:19,857
To tolerate that is our duty, right?

264
00:14:21,648 --> 00:14:23,346
Please don't tell this to my father.

265
00:14:23,501 --> 00:14:24,041
My god.

266
00:14:24,273 --> 00:14:27,789
I'd be lucky if you don't tell your father that I dashed into you.

267
00:14:28,344 --> 00:14:29,035
I'm...

268
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,781
...your hotel server.

269
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:37,980
What? What are you searching?

270
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:41,740
All the papads in my container fell into the drain.

271
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,299
I was looking at that.

272
00:14:43,378 --> 00:14:45,537
Le it go. You can buy some more.

273
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:49,366
If we were so wealthy, why would we have to sell them
door to door?

274
00:14:50,394 --> 00:14:51,814
To make those papads,

275
00:14:52,394 --> 00:14:54,219
...my mother would've worked very hard, you know?

276
00:14:56,677 --> 00:14:57,565
One moment.

277
00:14:58,324 --> 00:15:00,562
Take this money. You must not suffer the loss.

278
00:15:00,587 --> 00:15:01,461
Many thanks.

279
00:15:02,287 --> 00:15:04,724
We are not cheap like you seem to think.

280
00:15:05,109 --> 00:15:06,244
A request to you.

281
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:07,077
What?

282
00:15:07,395 --> 00:15:10,831
Ride your cycle to anywhere you like.

283
00:15:11,406 --> 00:15:11,859
But...

284
00:15:12,171 --> 00:15:13,996
Don't ride it on poor people's lives.

285
00:15:14,361 --> 00:15:14,948
That's all.

286
00:15:27,061 --> 00:15:28,966
Madam, madam.

287
00:15:28,991 --> 00:15:30,236
Come dear.

288
00:15:30,942 --> 00:15:31,704
Who is it?

289
00:15:31,729 --> 00:15:32,907
Whom do you want?

290
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:33,845
You...

291
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,171
No, no. Papads...

292
00:15:35,196 --> 00:15:36,036
No, no.

293
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:37,483
I was told that you sell papads.

294
00:15:37,508 --> 00:15:38,872
Did you want to buy some?

295
00:15:39,033 --> 00:15:43,267
Oh but this morning, I sent all that I had to doctor's and lawyer's house.

296
00:15:43,292 --> 00:15:44,657
They fell into the drain.

297
00:15:44,682 --> 00:15:45,754
Fell into the drain?

298
00:15:46,439 --> 00:15:47,502
He didn't drop them.

299
00:15:47,574 --> 00:15:50,463
Our cycles clashed and it all fell down.

300
00:15:50,488 --> 00:15:51,456
Krishna, Krishna.

301
00:15:51,683 --> 00:15:52,468
Then...

302
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:57,136
He felt sad about losing the papads his mother worked
hard to make.

303
00:15:57,401 --> 00:16:00,282
I tried to give him 10 rupees since I caused it.

304
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,000
He refused to take it and left.

305
00:16:02,819 --> 00:16:04,621
You please take it madam.

306
00:16:04,837 --> 00:16:05,639
Please take it.

307
00:16:06,203 --> 00:16:07,512
No, dear. No.

308
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,969
I'm glad people can still understand others' pain.

309
00:16:11,591 --> 00:16:12,805
You understood.

310
00:16:12,988 --> 00:16:14,400
That satisfaction is enough.

311
00:16:15,728 --> 00:16:16,728
What is your name?

312
00:16:17,192 --> 00:16:18,446
-Radha.
-Radha?

313
00:16:18,471 --> 00:16:19,248
Madam?

314
00:16:19,343 --> 00:16:20,557
Come in Kempi.

315
00:16:20,582 --> 00:16:21,605
I'll leave.

316
00:16:25,469 --> 00:16:26,913
She went just like she came.

317
00:16:27,003 --> 00:16:28,034
Kempi...

318
00:16:28,233 --> 00:16:32,423
...today's girls can't stop moving.

319
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:35,086
Yes, but why did she come here?

320
00:16:35,218 --> 00:16:36,441
-Kempi?
-Madam?

321
00:16:36,536 --> 00:16:38,290
Do you know this girl?

322
00:16:38,315 --> 00:16:39,957
Why do you ask so?

323
00:16:40,071 --> 00:16:43,579
She's the daughter of the owner of the hotel your husband works in.

324
00:16:43,823 --> 00:16:45,236
Is it?

325
00:16:45,347 --> 00:16:47,045
She looks like an Ivory doll.

326
00:16:47,231 --> 00:16:50,485
I guessed that she might be the daughter of someone important.

327
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,090
Then why wait?

328
00:16:52,181 --> 00:16:55,125
Why don't you ask her hand for your son?

329
00:16:55,192 --> 00:16:56,985
You are joking, right?

330
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,390
Why? What's wrong?

331
00:16:58,526 --> 00:17:02,764
Can there be any relationship between a palace and a dump?

332
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:04,638
We both are different. Forget about it.

333
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,492
Tell me. why have you come at this hour?

334
00:17:08,616 --> 00:17:09,290
What happened?

335
00:17:09,483 --> 00:17:11,753
Where else would I go?

336
00:17:12,048 --> 00:17:14,413
I've decided to come stay here.

337
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:17,052
I'll help you with all the odd chores.

338
00:17:17,308 --> 00:17:20,245
Eating any leftovers you give me,

339
00:17:20,422 --> 00:17:22,303
...I'll pass my time.

340
00:17:22,328 --> 00:17:25,146
Why are you talking like this, Kempi?

341
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:28,310
Have you fought with your husband again?

342
00:17:28,534 --> 00:17:31,757
I have no strength left to even quarrel with him any more.

343
00:17:31,782 --> 00:17:33,236
That's why I came here.

344
00:17:33,309 --> 00:17:34,936
Why do you say so?

345
00:17:34,961 --> 00:17:36,199
Yes...

346
00:17:36,439 --> 00:17:40,732
He would drink till he couldn't and come home late and fall sleep.

347
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,792
Now he can't even do that.

348
00:17:44,137 --> 00:17:48,630
I told him, again and again, not to drink and spoil his health.

349
00:17:48,898 --> 00:17:51,041
But he wouldn't listen. Madam...

350
00:17:51,193 --> 00:17:54,494
...so I decided not to stay where I'm not respected.

351
00:17:55,499 --> 00:17:57,182
Kempi, Kempi...

352
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,611
The ogre has come calling...

353
00:17:58,749 --> 00:18:00,169
Kempi is not here, go.

354
00:18:01,353 --> 00:18:04,171
What? What now? Why have you come calling Kempi now?

355
00:18:05,757 --> 00:18:06,915
Kempi's here. What now?

356
00:18:07,091 --> 00:18:08,758
You've come to Ayya's house?

357
00:18:08,783 --> 00:18:09,908
What else should I have done?

358
00:18:09,933 --> 00:18:11,821
What's all this Gangappa?

359
00:18:11,846 --> 00:18:13,743
-Move aside.
-You keep quiet.

360
00:18:13,976 --> 00:18:17,286
Listen. Shouldn't you look after your wife?

361
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:21,869
He would prefer a bottle of liquor to his wife.

362
00:18:22,725 --> 00:18:27,178
All wives pray to God that they die before their husbands.

363
00:18:27,317 --> 00:18:30,721
I... pray that I die after him.

364
00:18:31,035 --> 00:18:32,131
You know why madam?

365
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:35,172
There's no one to look after him after I die.

366
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:38,881
To add to our woes, there's not even a worm born to us.

367
00:18:39,124 --> 00:18:42,679
Did you hear? You must be very lucky to have such a wife.

368
00:18:42,969 --> 00:18:45,739
You must give up drinking at least after hearing this.

369
00:18:45,764 --> 00:18:47,559
No, he won't. No. he won't.

370
00:18:48,355 --> 00:18:51,196
Madam, I came here to tell her that I've given up drinking.

371
00:18:52,072 --> 00:18:54,167
I've given up drinking. Come let's go.

372
00:18:54,321 --> 00:18:55,575
You swear on me?

373
00:18:56,206 --> 00:18:59,214
Their god? You swear on Udupi Krishna?

374
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:00,454
I swear on their god too.

375
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:03,114
Swear on you, on me. I've given up drinking.

376
00:19:03,181 --> 00:19:03,744
What?

377
00:19:03,816 --> 00:19:04,522
Drinking.

378
00:19:04,565 --> 00:19:07,628
Oh my dear Ogre.

379
00:19:07,653 --> 00:19:09,883
What a nice thing you've done.

380
00:19:09,908 --> 00:19:11,053
My little parrot.

381
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,205
Krishna, it's all your blessings.

382
00:19:15,385 --> 00:19:17,710
Kempi, go happily now.

383
00:19:17,967 --> 00:19:20,642
Beware! You've sworn on god.

384
00:19:21,469 --> 00:19:22,445
I'll leave madam.

385
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:24,661
Come.

386
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,880
Call me by my name, Kempi. I'll come.

387
00:19:28,832 --> 00:19:29,721
Kempi...

388
00:19:30,364 --> 00:19:30,935
Come.

389
00:19:31,647 --> 00:19:32,781
I'll leave madam.

390
00:19:34,238 --> 00:19:35,524
Amma.

391
00:19:35,601 --> 00:19:36,974
Come, Muddukrishna.

392
00:19:36,999 --> 00:19:39,134
Half of all papads to lawyer's house and the other half to doctor's...

393
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:40,286
You delivered?

394
00:19:40,311 --> 00:19:40,995
Did they pay you?

395
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,154
Money?

396
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:44,212
And then...

397
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:47,420
Tell me... All the papads fell into the drain.

398
00:19:47,445 --> 00:19:49,295
Didn't they notice it when you delivered?

399
00:19:49,586 --> 00:19:50,713
-Amma...
-Huh?

400
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,491
Amma.

401
00:19:52,038 --> 00:19:52,999
That girl...

402
00:19:53,024 --> 00:19:54,382
Tell me. Why do you hesitate?

403
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,837
She came here too?

404
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,321
Nanjunda...

405
00:19:57,435 --> 00:20:00,141
There's only two words left.

406
00:20:00,215 --> 00:20:02,468
If we fill them properly...

407
00:20:02,598 --> 00:20:08,574
This time, Rs.2000, first prize in the Chakrabandha competition is guaranteed.

408
00:20:09,236 --> 00:20:10,260
Read the question.

409
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,297
It's not very difficult.

410
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:14,482
It's difficult to control this.

411
00:20:14,792 --> 00:20:16,038
Woman or eyes?

412
00:20:16,646 --> 00:20:19,487
You can't trust your eyes. It goes everywhere.

413
00:20:20,942 --> 00:20:23,347
Even woman doesn't listen to you.

414
00:20:23,372 --> 00:20:25,675
She does as she wishes.

415
00:20:25,773 --> 00:20:28,892
Because our eyes don't obey our wishes that we have to obey a woman.

416
00:20:28,917 --> 00:20:30,396
Therefore eyes are right.

417
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:33,716
If we close our eyes, it's like it's obeying us, right?

418
00:20:33,741 --> 00:20:35,154
So, woman is right.

419
00:20:35,243 --> 00:20:37,116
Ok. What's the other one?

420
00:20:38,255 --> 00:20:40,255
Most ruin themselves because of this.

421
00:20:40,361 --> 00:20:41,504
Pleasure or gambling.

422
00:20:41,926 --> 00:20:44,744
Pleasure is something everybody enjoys.

423
00:20:44,928 --> 00:20:46,682
So, gambling is right.

424
00:20:47,796 --> 00:20:49,209
Gambling is...

425
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,463
...only about losing money.

426
00:20:51,594 --> 00:20:54,491
But pleasure is not like that. It has more than that.

427
00:20:54,534 --> 00:20:55,994
So, pleasure is right.

428
00:20:56,139 --> 00:20:57,115
You're right.

429
00:20:57,346 --> 00:20:58,815
Pleasure or gambling?

430
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,388
Nanjunda...

431
00:21:00,794 --> 00:21:04,572
What if you're right and gambling is the right answer?

432
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,178
Srinivasa, you do one thing.

433
00:21:07,531 --> 00:21:09,611
Touch one of these two fingers.

434
00:21:09,654 --> 00:21:10,225
Touch.

435
00:21:13,618 --> 00:21:14,404
Pleasure is right.

436
00:21:14,619 --> 00:21:15,643
How's that?

437
00:21:15,818 --> 00:21:16,747
This is gambling.

438
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:18,185
This is pleasure.

439
00:21:18,576 --> 00:21:19,695
You left gambling...

440
00:21:19,822 --> 00:21:20,703
...and picked pleasure.

441
00:21:20,728 --> 00:21:21,838
So, pleasure is right.

442
00:21:22,271 --> 00:21:23,501
Let it go.

443
00:21:23,556 --> 00:21:25,739
Anyway the problem is solved now.

444
00:21:26,337 --> 00:21:27,979
-Sir?
-What?

445
00:21:28,355 --> 00:21:29,919
I'm feeling...

446
00:21:30,016 --> 00:21:32,412
...feverish and want to go home?

447
00:21:32,694 --> 00:21:33,924
I feel upset too.

448
00:21:34,139 --> 00:21:36,171
Go to hell.

449
00:21:36,308 --> 00:21:38,332
But before going...

450
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:40,930
...put this into the post box.

451
00:21:41,076 --> 00:21:44,029
Today is the last day for Chakrabandha competition.

452
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:47,515
Don't throw it away instead of putting it in the post box.

453
00:21:47,694 --> 00:21:48,781
How can I?

454
00:21:48,972 --> 00:21:51,060
I'm sending my entry too.

455
00:21:51,085 --> 00:21:51,998
You?

456
00:21:53,741 --> 00:21:57,177
What have you written? Woman or eyes?

457
00:21:57,202 --> 00:21:57,861
Eyes!

458
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,530
We've chosen woman.

459
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:01,460
Come here.

460
00:22:01,485 --> 00:22:02,748
Pleasure or gambling?

461
00:22:02,956 --> 00:22:03,599
Gambling.

462
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:04,933
And we, pleasure...

463
00:22:05,117 --> 00:22:06,180
What is this?

464
00:22:06,229 --> 00:22:08,681
He has chosen all the other ones.

465
00:22:08,706 --> 00:22:09,842
Oh, let it go.

466
00:22:09,969 --> 00:22:11,184
We're sure to get the prize.

467
00:22:11,361 --> 00:22:12,552
Maadhuraya...

468
00:22:12,656 --> 00:22:16,291
One has to fight in this competition with his wits.

469
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:22,295
One must have intelligence and memory power for that.

470
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,642
You have neither. So why would you participate?

471
00:22:24,733 --> 00:22:26,479
So that you may get the prize.

472
00:22:27,815 --> 00:22:30,323
Yes, they'll me the prize only because you told them so.

473
00:22:30,407 --> 00:22:33,113
We're idiots to talk with you. Go now.

474
00:22:33,138 --> 00:22:34,503
Go, go.

475
00:22:34,633 --> 00:22:35,832
Why do you get angry?

476
00:22:36,205 --> 00:22:37,260
Go!

477
00:22:41,806 --> 00:22:42,886
Sir.

478
00:22:42,997 --> 00:22:45,417
There's no stamp on this cover.

479
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:48,430
We've forgotten about it in this hullabaloo.

480
00:22:48,455 --> 00:22:50,708
Is this a sample of your memory power?

481
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:52,055
Go!

482
00:22:53,834 --> 00:22:54,985
Come.

483
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,821
Paste the stamp to it.

484
00:23:06,697 --> 00:23:07,618
Take this.

485
00:23:15,246 --> 00:23:16,238
Why do you hesitate?

486
00:23:16,494 --> 00:23:18,057
Is it a snake or a scorpion?

487
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:18,963
Spit.

488
00:23:23,065 --> 00:23:24,954
His time is not good.

489
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:28,693
This man. Seems to be born of time.

490
00:23:32,336 --> 00:23:35,415
Oh, evening prayers are on?

491
00:23:36,387 --> 00:23:38,061
Don't you know about my prayers?

492
00:23:38,311 --> 00:23:41,311
All it needs is a bit of jaggery candy for offering.

493
00:23:41,884 --> 00:23:44,329
But why are you back home so early today?

494
00:23:44,354 --> 00:23:47,427
Both my body and mind didn't feel well. So, informed my boss and came home.

495
00:23:47,587 --> 00:23:48,714
Don't feel well in the mind?

496
00:23:48,858 --> 00:23:50,731
Look. I'll tell you something...

497
00:23:50,756 --> 00:23:53,933
Those who are rich may not feel as happy as us.

498
00:23:53,959 --> 00:23:58,285
This mind, if you let it, will burn down the whole city.

499
00:23:59,761 --> 00:24:04,086
Looks like my wife is becoming the great poetess Sanchi Honnamma.

500
00:24:04,111 --> 00:24:04,886
Krishna, Krishna!

501
00:24:04,926 --> 00:24:06,553
Don't compare a molehill to a mountain.

502
00:24:06,657 --> 00:24:08,859
She came from a village
and I too come from a village.

503
00:24:08,883 --> 00:24:11,188
This is the extent of
the similarity between us.

504
00:24:12,106 --> 00:24:14,780
What if you are from the village?

505
00:24:14,805 --> 00:24:16,443
You are no less than anyone.

506
00:24:16,626 --> 00:24:18,944
You came as an innocent girl after our marriage.

507
00:24:19,033 --> 00:24:21,136
'Why do you sleep alone on the roof?', you asked.

508
00:24:21,161 --> 00:24:23,938
And then told me to come inside.

509
00:24:24,806 --> 00:24:26,956
Then in no time, mesmerised me with your sweet talk.

510
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:32,200
When I remember all that, I too feel young again.

511
00:24:33,393 --> 00:24:34,060
Hands off.

512
00:24:34,895 --> 00:24:36,260
Go wash your hands...

513
00:24:37,994 --> 00:24:40,066
Well I'm there for just that...

514
00:25:03,656 --> 00:25:05,323
Are you done with your singing?

515
00:25:18,084 --> 00:25:19,282
Ambu...

516
00:25:19,895 --> 00:25:21,038
Rice on this leaf...

517
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,794
With curd on it...

518
00:25:23,217 --> 00:25:24,391
Mango pickle...

519
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:25,471
Hands off...

520
00:25:25,695 --> 00:25:27,909
And such a wife in front of me...

521
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:30,007
To experience all this...

522
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:33,356
A man must have earned enough karma in his previous lives.

523
00:25:33,381 --> 00:25:35,744
Well you seem to have earned it.

524
00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:39,237
This contentment is what makes life here a paradise.

525
00:25:39,688 --> 00:25:42,354
If one is wise enough to see this, he enjoys. Otherwise nothing.

526
00:25:43,063 --> 00:25:43,992
Ambu...

527
00:25:44,492 --> 00:25:45,841
Believe me.

528
00:25:46,448 --> 00:25:49,218
Though this Maadhuraya is poor in wealth...

529
00:25:49,243 --> 00:25:52,075
...he is a millionaire when it comes to family.

530
00:25:55,861 --> 00:25:56,663
Ambu...

531
00:25:57,411 --> 00:25:58,133
You...

532
00:25:58,237 --> 00:26:00,182
-You have.
-Yes, I will.

533
00:26:10,205 --> 00:26:11,617
You will be at home, right?

534
00:26:12,689 --> 00:26:15,213
I'll go to Hanuman's temple be right back.

535
00:26:15,357 --> 00:26:18,096
Close the main door and then sleep. Don't just fall asleep.

536
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,030
What?

537
00:26:19,538 --> 00:26:20,617
You go now.

538
00:26:41,373 --> 00:26:43,436
Let the world scream...[singing]

539
00:26:44,063 --> 00:26:45,944
...or fight.

540
00:26:46,289 --> 00:26:48,853
Nothing compares to you, O sleep...

541
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:51,704
Maadhu, there's none to disturb you...

542
00:26:51,867 --> 00:26:53,915
Be it sun or rain...

543
00:26:53,994 --> 00:26:55,915
...you keep on moving.

544
00:26:57,237 --> 00:26:58,737
Sir, you're at home.

545
00:26:58,762 --> 00:26:59,785
What is it Kempamma?

546
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:00,915
Why are you so tensed?

547
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,790
I was just thinking about you.

548
00:27:02,815 --> 00:27:05,529
-The money you gave...
-I came to collect that, sir.

549
00:27:05,873 --> 00:27:08,508
My husband is suffering
from stomach ache.

550
00:27:08,532 --> 00:27:11,167
He's writhing like a fish removed from water.

551
00:27:11,222 --> 00:27:15,356
Doctor asked me to bring some medicines right now to save him.

552
00:27:15,415 --> 00:27:19,026
Please give me my money. His life is in your hands now.

553
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,027
50 rupees.

554
00:27:24,902 --> 00:27:25,449
Right now?

555
00:27:25,474 --> 00:27:27,505
I beg you, do something.

556
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:30,500
-I won't live if he dies.
-Kempamma...

557
00:27:30,551 --> 00:27:31,773
You go now...

558
00:27:31,829 --> 00:27:34,575
I'll bring the money to your home in half an hour's time.

559
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,482
Please do that sir. May god bless you with good life.

560
00:27:51,557 --> 00:27:53,137
I don't have a cent in hand.

561
00:27:53,803 --> 00:27:55,827
50 rupees? My god!

562
00:28:02,257 --> 00:28:04,900
Why did this Kempi give her money to me?

563
00:28:12,545 --> 00:28:17,252
I lost the money on these useless Chakrabandha competitions.

564
00:28:23,916 --> 00:28:26,536
What shall I do now? Whom shall I ask?

565
00:28:26,968 --> 00:28:27,841
Where shall I go?

566
00:28:28,047 --> 00:28:32,111
[Doctor asked me to bring some medicines right now to save him.]

567
00:28:32,481 --> 00:28:37,505
[He's writhing like a fish removed from water.]

568
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:40,058
[His life is in your hands now.]

569
00:28:40,235 --> 00:28:42,529
[I won't live if he dies.]

570
00:28:50,453 --> 00:28:51,429
What shall I do now?

571
00:28:52,048 --> 00:28:52,905
Whom shall I ask?

572
00:28:53,541 --> 00:28:54,351
Where shall I go?

573
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:58,252
Where's the house lock?

574
00:29:08,136 --> 00:29:09,882
Udupi Shri Krishna's money box.

575
00:29:13,725 --> 00:29:15,614
I have God's money.

576
00:29:24,238 --> 00:29:25,960
What if I take the money?

577
00:29:29,441 --> 00:29:31,719
Yes, as if I let you take it. It's God's money.

578
00:29:31,744 --> 00:29:34,055
I was just looking.

579
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,970
Why do I need it? What for?

580
00:29:35,995 --> 00:29:37,560
Is it? Then it's fine.

581
00:29:43,981 --> 00:29:45,584
I thought she had come.

582
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,230
That's alright.

583
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:49,420
But what will I tell her when she asks?

584
00:29:50,361 --> 00:29:51,099
That's Ok.

585
00:29:51,377 --> 00:29:53,758
What's wrong in taking the money in emergencies?

586
00:30:16,238 --> 00:30:17,190
25...

587
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,376
30...

588
00:30:23,189 --> 00:30:24,181
40...

589
00:30:25,336 --> 00:30:26,368
45...

590
00:30:27,783 --> 00:30:28,735
50...

591
00:30:29,838 --> 00:30:30,703
51...

592
00:30:32,184 --> 00:30:34,970
It's exactly 51.

593
00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:39,809
Why is body shaking like this?

594
00:30:40,042 --> 00:30:41,978
Is it a robbery or fraud?

595
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,369
This is all some kind of weakness...

596
00:30:46,619 --> 00:30:47,659
Yes...

597
00:30:47,906 --> 00:30:49,065
I too feel the same way.

598
00:30:49,154 --> 00:30:50,868
I went till the corner of the road.

599
00:30:50,924 --> 00:30:52,717
But couldn't go farther for some reason.

600
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:54,285
Tomorrow is Saturday.

601
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:57,438
I thought tomorrow is more auspicious to visit his temple and came back.

602
00:30:58,052 --> 00:30:58,703
That's fine...

603
00:30:58,909 --> 00:31:01,195
Why are you standing with hands folded like this?

604
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:03,906
Just like that.

605
00:31:04,146 --> 00:31:07,281
Wanted to pose like Swami Vivekananda. And I did.

606
00:31:07,434 --> 00:31:08,537
What's wrong?

607
00:31:08,897 --> 00:31:09,516
Do you see?

608
00:31:09,947 --> 00:31:13,106
After committing something wrong, see how hands tie themselves together.

609
00:31:13,488 --> 00:31:16,107
Wrong? Who? When? Where?

610
00:31:16,317 --> 00:31:16,936
There.

611
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,296
Here?

612
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:22,854
Ok. Now that you know, why make a fuss?

613
00:31:23,078 --> 00:31:23,912
Not making a fuss.

614
00:31:24,397 --> 00:31:25,589
I'll tell you what I know.

615
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:28,352
Because you know what you've done is wrong...

616
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,448
...you stand so fearfully in front of your wife.

617
00:31:30,783 --> 00:31:32,402
Why should I fear?

618
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:33,912
What have I done?

619
00:31:34,505 --> 00:31:35,688
I took money from the box.

620
00:31:35,792 --> 00:31:37,183
Where did the money in the box come from?

621
00:31:37,208 --> 00:31:38,033
You put it in there.

622
00:31:38,058 --> 00:31:40,073
Where did you get it? I gave it to you.

623
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:42,252
Who gave it to you? Shri Krishna gave it to you.

624
00:31:42,325 --> 00:31:43,635
Yes, believe what you want.

625
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:46,246
Your Krishna gave it. So, I took it for the second time.

626
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:49,163
Is it wrong?

627
00:31:49,452 --> 00:31:51,166
Wonderful...

628
00:31:51,318 --> 00:31:52,318
Tell me...

629
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:54,074
If...

630
00:31:54,321 --> 00:31:55,400
...your boss...

631
00:31:55,672 --> 00:31:59,085
...sent your salary with a servant,

632
00:31:59,597 --> 00:32:04,510
and you tip a rupee to that servant...

633
00:32:04,691 --> 00:32:07,024
Say you needed a rupee some other time...

634
00:32:07,112 --> 00:32:08,636
and you meet him exactly at that time.

635
00:32:08,867 --> 00:32:12,883
To ask back the rupee you tipped that servant...

636
00:32:13,115 --> 00:32:13,972
...is it right?

637
00:32:14,678 --> 00:32:16,075
This is also like that.

638
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:17,877
The money that you've taken now...

639
00:32:18,005 --> 00:32:23,005
...God will get it back from you with interest.

640
00:32:23,479 --> 00:32:24,995
How will he get it back?

641
00:32:25,776 --> 00:32:27,910
Did he leave it behind for me?

642
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:32,017
What if I don't give him? Will he send a warrant from his Udupi temple?

643
00:32:32,553 --> 00:32:33,736
Go away, naive woman.

644
00:32:33,816 --> 00:32:36,411
He has many cases against him.

645
00:32:36,556 --> 00:32:39,342
You make such fuss for one money box.

646
00:32:39,425 --> 00:32:42,148
You know how many curd pitchers he has broken?

647
00:32:45,613 --> 00:32:46,827
Poor Kempamma's husband...

648
00:32:47,027 --> 00:32:48,479
...is sick and dying.

649
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:52,253
At this hour, what is wrong in giving her money back?

650
00:32:52,956 --> 00:32:54,011
Look here, Ambu...

651
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:56,236
...if your Krishna really has any guts,

652
00:32:56,531 --> 00:32:59,198
...ask him to come to me to get his money back.

653
00:32:59,789 --> 00:33:00,313
I'll be back.

654
00:33:02,028 --> 00:33:03,139
Go, go.

655
00:33:04,062 --> 00:33:06,451
You'll clear Kempi's debt.

656
00:33:06,756 --> 00:33:07,541
But...

657
00:33:07,978 --> 00:33:10,176
...now you're in Krishna's debt.

658
00:33:10,201 --> 00:33:11,379
It won't...

659
00:33:12,308 --> 00:33:13,816
Krishna...Krishna...

660
00:33:15,401 --> 00:33:24,639
[singing film song - Amara Madura Prema]

661
00:33:38,424 --> 00:33:40,829
This full moon night is so beautiful.

662
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:45,180
I can sleep peacefully.

663
00:34:21,819 --> 00:34:23,938
Who is it?

664
00:34:39,297 --> 00:34:40,471
Is it Krishna?

665
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,791
Yes Maadhu.

666
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,871
It's me, Krishna.

667
00:34:47,408 --> 00:34:48,464
Krishna?

668
00:34:49,801 --> 00:34:51,872
Are you coming from Gokula [Lord's Krishna's abode]...

669
00:34:51,939 --> 00:34:53,828
or from a cinema shooting?

670
00:34:53,965 --> 00:34:55,417
From Gokula...

671
00:34:56,243 --> 00:34:57,592
Krishnaswamy...

672
00:34:57,761 --> 00:35:03,301
...you usually do not make time out of your group dance with Gopikas, do you?

673
00:35:03,326 --> 00:35:04,639
But now I've come.

674
00:35:04,714 --> 00:35:05,817
Oh, Okay.

675
00:35:05,953 --> 00:35:09,738
When a shetti comes a-calling, there must be something worth his time...

676
00:35:09,763 --> 00:35:10,776
Yes, yes...

677
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:13,529
The money you've taken from my box...

678
00:35:13,696 --> 00:35:15,656
...I've come to collect it.

679
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,462
The money from the box?

680
00:35:18,696 --> 00:35:20,109
Krishnaswamy...

681
00:35:20,245 --> 00:35:22,634
Have you run into such
bad times that you've to

682
00:35:22,658 --> 00:35:25,047
go collecting loose
change from collection boxes?

683
00:35:25,072 --> 00:35:26,281
-Maadhu...
-Huh?

684
00:35:26,537 --> 00:35:28,847
This arrangement of god's money box...

685
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:31,071
...is for your own benefit...

686
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,566
...and not for me.

687
00:35:32,615 --> 00:35:34,091
That's right.

688
00:35:34,149 --> 00:35:36,554
I had some problem and I took from it.

689
00:35:36,579 --> 00:35:37,936
So, what's wrong now?

690
00:35:38,019 --> 00:35:39,527
There's nothing wrong in taking.

691
00:35:39,877 --> 00:35:42,726
But that attitude of saying 'so what's wrong?'...

692
00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:43,776
...that's wrong.

693
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,549
What is this?

694
00:35:45,701 --> 00:35:49,241
You make such fuss over me taking money from my own box.

695
00:35:49,363 --> 00:35:52,307
Had I taken money from you signing a document or something...

696
00:35:52,423 --> 00:35:55,010
...you would've tortured me.

697
00:35:55,783 --> 00:35:58,077
Signing a document over taking money from the box?

698
00:35:58,351 --> 00:36:01,129
How would you know of money problems?

699
00:36:01,455 --> 00:36:03,773
The only money(mani) you know is Rukmani(Krishna's wife).

700
00:36:04,038 --> 00:36:05,916
When you're married
to Rukmani, how would

701
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:08,149
you know of the troubles
we poor people face?

702
00:36:08,174 --> 00:36:08,978
Maadhu.

703
00:36:09,566 --> 00:36:11,105
The responsibilities I have...

704
00:36:11,417 --> 00:36:12,949
...how would you know of them?

705
00:36:12,974 --> 00:36:15,587
Oh, some big responsibilities you have.

706
00:36:15,932 --> 00:36:18,353
Middle class have no dignity left.

707
00:36:18,861 --> 00:36:20,908
What about you? You have two families to enjoy.

708
00:36:21,032 --> 00:36:23,890
For your Rukmani's or Satyabhama's families...

709
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:26,241
...have you ever bought groceries?

710
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:29,934
Have you ever wandered from school to school for a seat for your child?

711
00:36:30,487 --> 00:36:31,503
Let it go.

712
00:36:31,646 --> 00:36:34,273
Now when cloth prices are through the roof,

713
00:36:34,298 --> 00:36:37,814
...if there was Draupadi Vastraapaharana...

714
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,810
...you would've remained silent.

715
00:36:39,918 --> 00:36:43,037
And couldn't have supplied even a metre of cloth.

716
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:45,231
Times are bad.

717
00:36:45,342 --> 00:36:48,755
I have to listen to all this for asking 50 rupees back?

718
00:36:49,314 --> 00:36:50,378
Maadhu.

719
00:36:50,737 --> 00:36:53,372
All the troubles faced by all lives in this world...

720
00:36:54,033 --> 00:36:55,494
...are the same troubles I face.

721
00:36:55,521 --> 00:36:58,068
You've already mentioned all of this in your Bhagawadgeeta.

722
00:36:58,324 --> 00:36:59,634
Krishnaswamy.

723
00:36:59,707 --> 00:37:02,786
Preaching is easy, but to follow what you preach is difficult.

724
00:37:02,949 --> 00:37:05,203
To stand as a stone in a temple is easy.

725
00:37:05,316 --> 00:37:08,118
But to stand in a queue for cooking oil is difficult.

726
00:37:08,367 --> 00:37:10,455
To roam around with your Chakra is easy...

727
00:37:10,605 --> 00:37:12,867
But to wander around for Sakkare[sugar] is difficult.

728
00:37:13,062 --> 00:37:14,721
I know everyone's troubles.

729
00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:17,629
This world is my family.

730
00:37:18,281 --> 00:37:22,028
I know very well, how is everybody, Maadhu.

731
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:24,137
What do you know?

732
00:37:25,351 --> 00:37:27,709
You say this whole world is your family.

733
00:37:27,862 --> 00:37:31,489
Why have you made some people rich and others poor?

734
00:37:31,845 --> 00:37:33,107
Maadhu.

735
00:37:33,631 --> 00:37:36,043
I don't make anyone rich...

736
00:37:36,539 --> 00:37:38,404
...or poor.

737
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:40,797
Whoever saves money...

738
00:37:41,107 --> 00:37:42,988
...in their bank of future,

739
00:37:43,473 --> 00:37:46,116
...will encash that and live happily.

740
00:37:47,407 --> 00:37:49,740
And those who don't, suffer.

741
00:37:50,021 --> 00:37:51,394
Krishnaswamy.

742
00:37:51,546 --> 00:37:52,864
Forget about others.

743
00:37:52,947 --> 00:37:57,137
Have I accrued any merits from my previous life?

744
00:37:57,291 --> 00:37:58,339
How can I tell that?

745
00:37:58,507 --> 00:38:01,428
How can you not know that? Are you even God?

746
00:38:01,638 --> 00:38:05,677
You think one can have all the happiness if one just has the money?

747
00:38:05,702 --> 00:38:10,214
If one has money, he can have 8 storey house, AC car...

748
00:38:10,487 --> 00:38:12,273
...a servant here, a servant there.

749
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:15,443
One can buy farm, house and everything in between.

750
00:38:16,278 --> 00:38:17,771
If one has even more money,

751
00:38:17,902 --> 00:38:21,235
...leaving father and mother, one can buy everything.

752
00:38:21,588 --> 00:38:23,159
Krishnaswamy.

753
00:38:23,184 --> 00:38:24,937
One can buy even you.

754
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,124
Fine.

755
00:38:26,553 --> 00:38:28,839
What if you are poor?

756
00:38:28,912 --> 00:38:30,293
Krishnaswamy.

757
00:38:30,645 --> 00:38:33,287
Because you have Mahalakshmi[Goddess of Wealth] residing in your heart,

758
00:38:33,312 --> 00:38:34,891
..you're a multi-millionaire.

759
00:38:35,133 --> 00:38:37,085
If not for that, you'll be a pauper.

760
00:38:37,117 --> 00:38:38,228
Maadhu...

761
00:38:38,466 --> 00:38:40,847
The world may be like you say...

762
00:38:41,324 --> 00:38:42,951
...but I'm not like that.

763
00:38:43,617 --> 00:38:46,823
I do not discriminate between my devotees.

764
00:38:46,848 --> 00:38:48,278
Oh, stop it.

765
00:38:48,407 --> 00:38:50,589
You have discrimination within you. You know?

766
00:38:50,726 --> 00:38:52,925
You are offered butter in Udupi temple.

767
00:38:53,087 --> 00:38:55,184
But not even oil is offered to you in Halebidu temple.

768
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:57,819
Arasikere Ganesha is grand.

769
00:38:57,963 --> 00:39:00,463
The Ganesha under the Peepal tree is meek.

770
00:39:00,626 --> 00:39:02,261
And you speak of discrimination.

771
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:03,144
Fine, then.

772
00:39:03,622 --> 00:39:06,289
I thought of opening your eyes myself.

773
00:39:06,982 --> 00:39:10,418
But if I have to make you open them yourself,

774
00:39:11,017 --> 00:39:12,208
...what can one do?

775
00:39:13,163 --> 00:39:14,250
Maadhu...

776
00:39:14,576 --> 00:39:15,766
Tomorrow...

777
00:39:16,197 --> 00:39:17,737
...you will get 2000 rupees.

778
00:39:22,387 --> 00:39:23,935
2000 rupees?

779
00:39:24,453 --> 00:39:26,556
Where will it come from, Krishnaswamy?

780
00:39:26,606 --> 00:39:28,789
From the account of your Karma.

781
00:39:29,647 --> 00:39:32,132
Save all your Karma and Dharma for Arjuna.

782
00:39:32,438 --> 00:39:34,699
When you get 2000 rupees tomorrow,

783
00:39:35,186 --> 00:39:36,447
...what will you give me?

784
00:39:39,215 --> 00:39:41,858
You too have started taking bribes now?

785
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:43,519
Right, right.

786
00:39:44,228 --> 00:39:45,752
I'll give you 500 rupees.

787
00:39:46,778 --> 00:39:48,016
Think again and answer.

788
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:53,830
I'll give you 551 rupees.

789
00:39:53,855 --> 00:39:55,193
Including the money from the box.

790
00:39:55,241 --> 00:39:55,876
Very good.

791
00:39:56,304 --> 00:39:57,050
Then,

792
00:39:57,370 --> 00:40:00,155
...all the money problems you have will go away from tomorrow.

793
00:40:00,601 --> 00:40:02,220
You'll be happy.

794
00:40:02,476 --> 00:40:03,182
Won't you?

795
00:40:03,391 --> 00:40:07,137
Come and see for yourself how I'll be living happily.

796
00:40:10,804 --> 00:40:12,145
I'm getting sleepy.

797
00:40:12,187 --> 00:40:15,234
I have to get up at 4AM and go grind the batter.

798
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:18,950
You go get inside the temple before it opens.

799
00:40:19,614 --> 00:40:25,272
Otherwise, we'll read in papers that someone has stolen your idol and sold it off in America.

800
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:26,423
Go, go.

801
00:40:29,459 --> 00:40:32,634
I'm a manual labourer. I'll get sleep as soon as I close my eyes.

802
00:40:32,748 --> 00:40:37,486
But yours isn't that easy. It'll be sunrise before you take off all those jewels and crown.

803
00:40:37,561 --> 00:40:40,934
Go, go. Goodnight, Krishnaswamy, goodnight.

804
00:40:47,017 --> 00:40:47,811
Maadhu.

805
00:40:49,123 --> 00:40:51,305
Tonight's sleep is your last comfortable sleep.

806
00:40:52,776 --> 00:40:55,007
How will you be happy from tomorrow?

807
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:00,926

860
00:42:25,005 --> 00:42:26,109
In this life,

861
00:42:26,339 --> 00:42:29,220
...I never thought we'd see so much money.

862
00:42:30,028 --> 00:42:30,885
Tell me,

863
00:42:31,544 --> 00:42:33,774
...how did they give you this prize?

864
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:36,587
What will he give?

865
00:42:37,027 --> 00:42:39,980
It came from my karmic account of merits,

866
00:42:40,092 --> 00:42:42,037
...said your Krishna.

867
00:42:42,062 --> 00:42:44,031
You keep saying 'Krishna said'.

868
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:46,001
Did you really see Lord Krishna?

869
00:42:46,116 --> 00:42:48,648
Or did you just see him in a dream?

870
00:42:49,269 --> 00:42:51,245
I'm deluded?

871
00:42:51,582 --> 00:42:53,106
I really saw Krishna.

872
00:42:53,276 --> 00:42:55,173
With my own two eyes...

873
00:42:55,268 --> 00:42:57,427
...saw Va.De Krishna.

874
00:42:57,452 --> 00:42:59,222
-Va.De Krishna?
-Yes.

875
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,781
Va. De Krishna means...

876
00:43:00,852 --> 00:43:04,011
Vasudeva and Devaki's son Krishna. I saw him.

877
00:43:04,036 --> 00:43:05,547
Krishna, Krishna.

878
00:43:05,572 --> 00:43:06,827
You're a blessed being.

879
00:43:06,852 --> 00:43:07,892
Turn this way.

880
00:43:08,273 --> 00:43:09,424
Stand like that.

881
00:43:11,283 --> 00:43:12,410
Stand properly.

882
00:43:13,756 --> 00:43:15,335
May you live long with your husband.

883
00:43:17,451 --> 00:43:19,197
Do you need any other boon?

884
00:43:21,463 --> 00:43:23,987
Big devotees like Purandharadasa and Kanakadasa...

885
00:43:24,717 --> 00:43:26,320
...singing thousands of songs of him...

886
00:43:26,738 --> 00:43:27,785
...pleased Krishna.

887
00:43:28,492 --> 00:43:31,843
Even they had to go through many
difficulties to before they saw Krishna.

888
00:43:32,752 --> 00:43:34,610
But he appeared to you so easily.

889
00:43:36,771 --> 00:43:38,326
To make him appear,

890
00:43:38,423 --> 00:43:39,828
...did you sing any song?

891
00:43:40,539 --> 00:43:41,443
Which song?

892
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,164
"He stole the sarees of women..."[A film song]

893
00:43:45,225 --> 00:43:46,923
"He won the heart of Radha"

894
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:50,450
"Thief of thieves, Krishna comes..."

895
00:43:51,901 --> 00:43:53,385
Isn't the song good?

896
00:43:54,363 --> 00:43:56,252
He won't come for any songs.

897
00:43:56,302 --> 00:43:59,452
If there's any money to be collected,
he'll come running.

898
00:43:59,584 --> 00:44:00,290
See...

899
00:44:00,425 --> 00:44:03,703
I had taken money from your God's box, right?

900
00:44:03,897 --> 00:44:06,675
That's why he came and woke me up from sleep.

901
00:44:06,869 --> 00:44:08,258
Now you see?

902
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:12,195
Didn't I tell you that he won't rest until he recovered his money?

903
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:14,413
'Didn't I tell you?' You fool!

904
00:44:15,005 --> 00:44:16,037
When did he collect?

905
00:44:16,751 --> 00:44:17,695
When did I give?

906
00:44:17,975 --> 00:44:20,705
He got an earful from me before he went.

907
00:44:21,362 --> 00:44:23,743
Anyhow, that Krishna...

908
00:44:24,681 --> 00:44:27,022
...blessed us with 2000 rupees.

909
00:44:27,549 --> 00:44:29,302
What did your Krishna do?

910
00:44:29,481 --> 00:44:32,496
I won it using my intellect.

911
00:44:32,521 --> 00:44:34,595
This is where you fail.

912
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:36,541
When man is poor,

913
00:44:36,868 --> 00:44:38,356
...his heart is rich and generous.

914
00:44:38,521 --> 00:44:40,013
But when he gets rich,

915
00:44:40,118 --> 00:44:41,555
his heart becomes poor.

916
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:43,016
It's not like that.

917
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,709
Do you know what I'll do with that money?

918
00:44:45,927 --> 00:44:48,855
The sweetmeat stall opposite Krishna Cafe,

919
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:49,706
...I'll buy it.

920
00:44:49,731 --> 00:44:51,074
You mean you'll quit your job?

921
00:44:51,099 --> 00:44:52,376
I quit already.

922
00:44:52,401 --> 00:44:56,384
Our Muddukrishna too would have said Ta-Ta to Srinivasa and be on his way home by now.

923
00:44:56,409 --> 00:45:00,207
How can you let go of a permanent job for a temporary joy?

924
00:45:00,232 --> 00:45:02,226
What if this joy becomes permanent?

925
00:45:02,251 --> 00:45:04,577
You don't know anything. Look...

926
00:45:04,714 --> 00:45:06,000
...next Thursday...

927
00:45:06,025 --> 00:45:08,929
...there is opening ceremony of Madhava sweetmeat stall.

928
00:45:10,133 --> 00:45:11,062
Is meals ready?

929
00:45:11,649 --> 00:45:14,395
Your favourite curd rice and pickle is ready.

930
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:17,874
The same old curd rice and pickle even when we've money?

931
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:22,300
I knew you'd say that. I've cooked something else for you.

932
00:45:22,382 --> 00:45:24,247
Then the curd rice and pickle?

933
00:45:24,272 --> 00:45:24,868
I'll eat.

934
00:45:25,753 --> 00:45:26,674
Look.

935
00:45:27,048 --> 00:45:27,977
Not just 2000,

936
00:45:28,398 --> 00:45:32,263
...even if get 20 million, I'll still be the same.

937
00:45:33,252 --> 00:45:34,514
I won't change.

938
00:45:38,059 --> 00:45:39,829
Madhava Sweetmeat stall.

939
00:45:39,879 --> 00:45:41,141
[Maadhu Sweet Stall]

940
00:45:43,354 --> 00:45:44,877
-Muddukrishna.
-What is it father?

941
00:45:45,164 --> 00:45:46,552
Did you pay the chit fund money?

942
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:47,402
Yes.

943
00:46:24,913 --> 00:46:26,143
Maadhu.

944
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:27,746
Are you well?

945
00:46:28,566 --> 00:46:30,931
Oh, Krishnaswamy.

946
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:33,750
Welcome, welcome.

947
00:46:34,579 --> 00:46:37,864
We met on the roof last time.

948
00:46:38,108 --> 00:46:38,822
Yes, yes.

949
00:46:39,965 --> 00:46:41,052
Have this sweet.

950
00:46:41,214 --> 00:46:42,833
Why give me sweet?

951
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:43,708
Why?

952
00:46:44,209 --> 00:46:46,558
You have Diabetes?

953
00:46:46,957 --> 00:46:48,426
Nothing like that.

954
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:50,070
Why do you say no?

955
00:46:50,954 --> 00:46:51,668
Never mind.

956
00:46:51,893 --> 00:46:52,948
Krishnaswamy.

957
00:46:53,337 --> 00:46:54,575
How are you?

958
00:46:55,294 --> 00:46:57,984
I'll always be the same.

959
00:46:58,502 --> 00:46:59,621
I won't change.

960
00:46:59,941 --> 00:47:03,203
You mean I've changed?

961
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:07,969
The way you sting with your words is
stronger than scorpion's.

962
00:47:08,869 --> 00:47:11,925
You get upset when I am just joking.

963
00:47:12,731 --> 00:47:13,572
Never mind.

964
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:16,876
I think I came at the wrong time.

965
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:19,095
I'll come again.

966
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:20,707
Wait, Krishnaswamy.

967
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:23,788
Take these two sweets.

968
00:47:24,053 --> 00:47:26,632
One is for Rukmini and another for Satyabhama.

969
00:47:28,683 --> 00:47:30,414
So that it doesn't cause any problems at home.

970
00:47:31,011 --> 00:47:32,035
Hold your hand out.

971
00:47:34,761 --> 00:47:35,976
This is Avalakki.

972
00:47:36,384 --> 00:47:38,185
Not like the ones Sudhama gave you.

973
00:47:38,330 --> 00:47:39,957
Not those ordinary Avalakki.

974
00:47:40,435 --> 00:47:44,253
I personally fried them in ghee with coconut and cashews added.

975
00:47:46,059 --> 00:47:47,456
How is it?

976
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:54,346
He's gone.

977
00:47:55,952 --> 00:47:59,413
I think he had come to collect his 551 rupees.

978
00:47:59,701 --> 00:48:02,892
Seeing the sweet and savouries, poor fellow forgot to ask.

979
00:48:02,917 --> 00:48:04,418
What did you forget?

980
00:48:04,443 --> 00:48:08,072
We had to pay 551 rupees to the ghee vendor.

981
00:48:08,097 --> 00:48:09,173
How much have we made till now?

982
00:48:09,198 --> 00:48:10,379
316 rupees.

983
00:48:10,404 --> 00:48:14,540
Ok. Pay him this evening and get another 4 tins of ghee.

984
00:48:14,565 --> 00:48:15,995
Ok, father.

985
00:48:16,141 --> 00:48:17,594
Please sit down.

986
00:48:20,797 --> 00:48:28,106
I heard you have made big name catering to 4-5 parties. So, I came to you.

987
00:48:28,153 --> 00:48:33,233
4-5 parties? Make it 400-500 parties. Have this coffee.

988
00:48:33,258 --> 00:48:33,959
It'll get cold.

989
00:48:34,532 --> 00:48:38,770
I cater to at least 100 parties a year.

990
00:48:40,424 --> 00:48:41,686
How is the coffee?

991
00:48:42,445 --> 00:48:44,945
Coffee is very thick.

992
00:48:44,970 --> 00:48:47,415
If you make it so thick,

993
00:48:47,959 --> 00:48:49,412
...will you make money?

994
00:48:49,446 --> 00:48:52,272
Can we make it the same way for everyone?

995
00:48:52,297 --> 00:48:54,108
It depends on the person.

996
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:57,911
It's only for important folks like you.

997
00:48:57,936 --> 00:48:59,755
Is it? Then...

998
00:49:00,115 --> 00:49:00,854
...for others?

999
00:49:00,879 --> 00:49:03,347
How can we supply the same for others?

1000
00:49:03,372 --> 00:49:06,658
For them, a quarter of coffee powder with 3 quarters of Tamarind seed powder.

1001
00:49:06,683 --> 00:49:07,464
Yes.

1002
00:49:07,615 --> 00:49:09,576
You know we make Badam Halwa.

1003
00:49:09,674 --> 00:49:11,706
It has only 4-5 almonds.

1004
00:49:11,826 --> 00:49:14,865
Rest is covered by peanuts.

1005
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:16,996
Milk is made with dairy whitener.

1006
00:49:17,284 --> 00:49:18,935
Oil, adulterated.

1007
00:49:19,105 --> 00:49:20,716
Yes.

1008
00:49:21,177 --> 00:49:23,439
You saw today's Ambode, right?

1009
00:49:23,606 --> 00:49:25,558
It was Pakora yesterday.

1010
00:49:25,657 --> 00:49:29,895
You mean yesterday's Pakoras have become today's Vada.

1011
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:30,867
Yes, become Vada.

1012
00:49:30,892 --> 00:49:33,972
Yes, bring them, grind and deep fry in oil and it goes on.

1013
00:49:33,997 --> 00:49:37,562
If not for that, it's very difficult to run the hotel.

1014
00:49:37,685 --> 00:49:39,376
I've to lock it down.

1015
00:49:40,903 --> 00:49:41,760
Look.

1016
00:49:41,919 --> 00:49:47,331
If you want me to 'look after' you separately, I'm up for that too.

1017
00:49:47,837 --> 00:49:48,773
You mean...

1018
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:51,109
...there's something for me.

1019
00:49:52,421 --> 00:49:54,254
It's not that big a deal.

1020
00:49:54,279 --> 00:49:55,132
This is nothing.

1021
00:49:55,259 --> 00:49:56,410
Last time,

1022
00:49:56,468 --> 00:49:59,420
...a party similar to this worth 3000 rupees...

1023
00:49:59,445 --> 00:50:02,761
...a lizard fell into the sambhar. What can I do?

1024
00:50:02,861 --> 00:50:04,631
I picked it up and threw it away.

1025
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:07,260
But the organisation's secretary somehow
came to know of it.

1026
00:50:07,285 --> 00:50:09,517
He created troubles in approving my bills.

1027
00:50:09,632 --> 00:50:10,703
Would I let it go?

1028
00:50:10,776 --> 00:50:12,729
Took him aside and greased his hands.

1029
00:50:12,944 --> 00:50:14,587
And the bill instantly passed.

1030
00:50:14,612 --> 00:50:16,487
This is all very common.

1031
00:50:16,512 --> 00:50:20,092
But I feel scared.

1032
00:50:20,824 --> 00:50:22,483
Why are you afraid?

1033
00:50:22,654 --> 00:50:24,527
I'm here to give you courage.

1034
00:50:24,583 --> 00:50:26,369
You're after all the secretary.

1035
00:50:26,394 --> 00:50:29,236
You just pass my bills like that.

1036
00:50:29,325 --> 00:50:30,127
I...

1037
00:50:30,828 --> 00:50:32,067
...will pass it you like this

1038
00:50:33,449 --> 00:50:34,909
Are you married?

1039
00:50:35,189 --> 00:50:37,039
Three wives and one child.

1040
00:50:37,064 --> 00:50:38,088
Oh?

1041
00:50:38,803 --> 00:50:41,034
One wife and three children.

1042
00:50:41,059 --> 00:50:44,799
You haven't learnt anything even after having three kids.

1043
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,547
Look, sir.

1044
00:50:46,726 --> 00:50:49,647
I'll give you 100 rupees as an advance.

1045
00:50:49,997 --> 00:50:51,386
We'll build on that.

1046
00:50:51,476 --> 00:50:54,142
And in 6 months you'll make more money than me.

1047
00:50:56,147 --> 00:50:57,155
Then...

1048
00:50:57,908 --> 00:50:58,678
Tomorrow...

1049
00:50:59,372 --> 00:51:00,326
I'll bring the advance.

1050
00:51:00,359 --> 00:51:02,319
Please don't forget.

1051
00:51:03,192 --> 00:51:05,541
Anyway, you please give me your address.

1052
00:51:05,737 --> 00:51:08,864
If you couldn't come tomorrow or were late...

1053
00:51:08,889 --> 00:51:10,660
...I'll come by your house.

1054
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:14,985
I'll leave.

1055
00:51:15,041 --> 00:51:17,112
-Good, Namaskara.
-Namaskara.

1056
00:51:19,617 --> 00:51:22,149
Hey Maadhuraya...

1057
00:51:22,311 --> 00:51:24,541
...you dare compete against me?

1058
00:51:24,615 --> 00:51:28,369
Look how I've caught myself a big customer
early in the day.

1059
00:51:31,884 --> 00:51:33,304
Arogyaswamy.

1060
00:51:33,329 --> 00:51:35,126
Health Inspector?

1061
00:51:35,269 --> 00:51:37,451
This fiend!

1062
00:51:37,476 --> 00:51:39,152
Had to come here of all the places?

1063
00:51:39,376 --> 00:51:44,304
And I spilled all the secrets of
my hotel before him.

1064
00:51:47,315 --> 00:51:49,521
-Little master.
-Kempamma.

1065
00:51:49,546 --> 00:51:50,442
Come, come.

1066
00:51:50,467 --> 00:51:51,381
How are you?

1067
00:51:51,406 --> 00:51:52,167
I'm like always.

1068
00:51:52,246 --> 00:51:54,000
May God bless you.

1069
00:51:55,490 --> 00:51:58,267
Little master, what are you doing?

1070
00:51:58,292 --> 00:51:59,101
Exercise.

1071
00:51:59,126 --> 00:52:00,612
What's the matter?

1072
00:52:00,637 --> 00:52:02,304
Please stop it.

1073
00:52:02,505 --> 00:52:03,664
Isn't master home?

1074
00:52:03,689 --> 00:52:04,657
He's taking a bath.

1075
00:52:04,753 --> 00:52:06,507
Oh, won't you stop?

1076
00:52:06,532 --> 00:52:07,859
How's your milk business?

1077
00:52:07,884 --> 00:52:10,955
Milk business has come down to a quarter
of what it used to be.

1078
00:52:11,131 --> 00:52:11,742
Why?

1079
00:52:11,767 --> 00:52:12,608
Why?

1080
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:15,372
In our business, hotels are our biggest customers.

1081
00:52:15,397 --> 00:52:17,802
I used to supply most of my milk to Krishna Cafe.

1082
00:52:17,827 --> 00:52:20,505
But it closed down.

1083
00:52:20,539 --> 00:52:21,539
I didn't know that.

1084
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:23,509
I wanted to ask your husband.

1085
00:52:23,542 --> 00:52:25,360
Why have they closed their cafe from two days?

1086
00:52:25,385 --> 00:52:28,734
They didn't close. Corporation! Corporation!

1087
00:52:28,848 --> 00:52:30,403
Health officer came...

1088
00:52:31,566 --> 00:52:32,217
...and locked.

1089
00:52:32,362 --> 00:52:33,624
How sad.

1090
00:52:33,649 --> 00:52:35,045
What's sad in that?

1091
00:52:35,197 --> 00:52:36,213
Little master.

1092
00:52:36,238 --> 00:52:37,730
-You know what happened?
-What?

1093
00:52:37,796 --> 00:52:40,415
Without knowing that the guest was the health officer,

1094
00:52:40,537 --> 00:52:42,259
...he told them, how they make Pakoras...

1095
00:52:42,490 --> 00:52:44,357
...how they make coffee with Tamarind seeds.

1096
00:52:44,382 --> 00:52:46,159
That everything is adulterated there,

1097
00:52:46,184 --> 00:52:48,170
...he told him everything without holding back.

1098
00:52:48,195 --> 00:52:48,932
And got caught.

1099
00:52:48,967 --> 00:52:51,483
Their business was down even before that.

1100
00:52:51,508 --> 00:52:52,936
That was also because of you.

1101
00:52:52,992 --> 00:52:57,087
You started selling good sweets and savouries
in your shop.

1102
00:52:57,209 --> 00:53:00,519
Customers started flocking your shop like flies.

1103
00:53:01,175 --> 00:53:03,215
Is it wrong to compete in business?

1104
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,669
It's not wrong.

1105
00:53:04,726 --> 00:53:07,234
God's blessing is on you.

1106
00:53:07,259 --> 00:53:10,791
That's why health officer shut their shop.

1107
00:53:10,816 --> 00:53:11,233
Kempi.

1108
00:53:11,336 --> 00:53:12,519
Madam.

1109
00:53:12,544 --> 00:53:14,138
What brings you here?

1110
00:53:14,163 --> 00:53:17,689
Nothing, I came to see the senior master.

1111
00:53:17,762 --> 00:53:18,826
What's the matter?

1112
00:53:18,851 --> 00:53:19,343
Nothing.

1113
00:53:19,368 --> 00:53:20,224
Can't you tell me?

1114
00:53:20,249 --> 00:53:21,536
I can...

1115
00:53:21,561 --> 00:53:22,655
Then tell me...

1116
00:53:22,873 --> 00:53:25,428
Krishna cafe is for sale.

1117
00:53:25,453 --> 00:53:28,398
I came to put it in his ears.

1118
00:53:28,423 --> 00:53:29,320
Kempamma.

1119
00:53:29,966 --> 00:53:32,927
How would one put such a big thing in one's ear?

1120
00:53:32,952 --> 00:53:33,510
How?

1121
00:53:33,867 --> 00:53:35,669
Little master!

1122
00:53:35,694 --> 00:53:36,623
Look at him madam.

1123
00:53:36,648 --> 00:53:37,718
Keep quiet son.

1124
00:53:38,127 --> 00:53:39,754
You mean we should buy it?

1125
00:53:39,779 --> 00:53:40,444
Yes.

1126
00:53:40,531 --> 00:53:41,476
Yeah, right.

1127
00:53:41,573 --> 00:53:43,168
What will the neighbours think?

1128
00:53:43,321 --> 00:53:44,543
What will they think?

1129
00:53:44,912 --> 00:53:46,870
If we don't buy, someone else
will and put a military

1130
00:53:46,894 --> 00:53:48,642
hotel(non- vegetarian restaurant) there.

1131
00:53:48,667 --> 00:53:49,724
Yes mother.

1132
00:53:49,749 --> 00:53:52,693
They'll butcher chickens and sheep in front of our shop.

1133
00:53:52,718 --> 00:53:54,261
Blood will flow like water in gutters.

1134
00:53:54,286 --> 00:53:56,762
And foul smell too. Please say yes.

1135
00:53:56,787 --> 00:53:57,288
Krishna!

1136
00:53:57,313 --> 00:53:58,304
Sir,

1137
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,313
...please think it over.

1138
00:54:00,434 --> 00:54:05,021
Srinivasayya himself has sent me as a mediator to you.

1139
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:07,163
What do you say Ambu?

1140
00:54:07,298 --> 00:54:10,544
Under your Krishna's mediatorship, Kurukshetra war began.

1141
00:54:10,666 --> 00:54:14,174
Under Kempamma's mediatorship, our hotel business begins.

1142
00:54:14,199 --> 00:54:17,028
Sir, you arrange 10000 rupees.

1143
00:54:17,053 --> 00:54:18,418
We'll complete the transaction.

1144
00:54:18,556 --> 00:54:21,905
What about the 10000 rupees chit funds?

1145
00:54:22,052 --> 00:54:23,608
When can we take the funds out?

1146
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:26,910
If you're ready to let go of 2500 rupees, we can withdraw tomorrow.

1147
00:54:27,121 --> 00:54:27,486
Alright.

1148
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:28,820
Kempamma.

1149
00:54:28,891 --> 00:54:30,868
Go and tell your master that we've agreed.

1150
00:54:31,458 --> 00:54:34,109
I'll have collected all my monies.

1151
00:54:34,134 --> 00:54:35,454
We shall finish this business tomorrow itself.

1152
00:54:35,479 --> 00:54:36,765
Sir, I'll leave.

1153
00:54:36,790 --> 00:54:37,551
I'll leave madam.

1154
00:54:37,576 --> 00:54:41,489
Little master, I'll supply the milk to the hotel.

1155
00:54:42,469 --> 00:54:44,033
-Muddukrishna.
-Appa?

1156
00:54:44,058 --> 00:54:46,798
Go now and look into the chit fund matter.

1157
00:54:46,888 --> 00:54:48,309
-Yes.
-Go!

1158
00:54:50,597 --> 00:54:52,200
What do you say, Ambu?

1159
00:54:52,306 --> 00:54:54,996
The hotel in which your husband used to grind...

1160
00:54:55,021 --> 00:54:58,004
...he is the owner of the same hotel.

1161
00:54:58,797 --> 00:55:00,829
[Shri Krishna Cafe]

1162
00:55:06,123 --> 00:55:08,480
Hotel seems to be newly bought?

1163
00:55:08,887 --> 00:55:10,784
It may be new to you.

1164
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:12,339
It is very old to me.

1165
00:55:12,364 --> 00:55:13,198
Oh?

1166
00:55:14,051 --> 00:55:17,638
So...you do remember old things, huh?

1167
00:55:17,769 --> 00:55:19,015
Krishnaswamy!

1168
00:55:19,221 --> 00:55:22,737
Are you jealous that a grinder bought the hotel he worked in?

1169
00:55:22,762 --> 00:55:23,670
No.

1170
00:55:24,133 --> 00:55:25,999
You becoming the hotel owner...

1171
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:27,572
...is happy news to me.

1172
00:55:27,701 --> 00:55:29,256
Oh, don't I know?

1173
00:55:29,281 --> 00:55:32,376
Your stomach is boiling with envy.

1174
00:55:32,541 --> 00:55:36,604
Let it be. Why have you come at closing hours?

1175
00:55:37,847 --> 00:55:42,204
I wanted to see the night life in Bengaluru.

1176
00:55:42,638 --> 00:55:45,091
Before that, I wanted to see you...

1177
00:55:45,116 --> 00:55:48,345
Very nice. Server! one special coffee for brother...

1178
00:55:48,817 --> 00:55:49,659
...for Krishna!

1179
00:55:49,756 --> 00:55:50,613
Maadhu.

[Shows 'no supply' sign]

1181
00:55:52,075 --> 00:55:53,851
It's special service for you.

1182
00:55:53,876 --> 00:55:54,610
No need.

1183
00:55:54,752 --> 00:55:55,578
Why?

1184
00:55:56,087 --> 00:55:58,126
You have blood pressure?

1185
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:59,066
Nothing like that.

1186
00:55:59,099 --> 00:56:02,036
Who offers you coffee anyway?

1187
00:56:02,141 --> 00:56:05,014
Why don't you drink this free coffee?

1188
00:56:05,423 --> 00:56:06,756
Who is this coffee for?

1189
00:56:06,781 --> 00:56:08,018
For Krishnaswamy...

1190
00:56:11,851 --> 00:56:12,787
There's nobody here.

1191
00:56:17,148 --> 00:56:18,799
It's ok. Keep it there and go.

1192
00:56:22,179 --> 00:56:23,845
Please take it, Krishnaswamy.

1193
00:56:30,187 --> 00:56:31,869
Tell me how it is.

1194
00:56:32,102 --> 00:56:33,157
Because...

1195
00:56:33,326 --> 00:56:38,001
...in tomorrow's paper, I can put an ad saying...

1196
00:56:38,026 --> 00:56:40,655
...Lord Krishna himself had this coffee and approved.

1197
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:43,555
I can print your photo in the advertisement.

1198
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:44,463
Maadhu.

1199
00:56:45,283 --> 00:56:47,814
How did you become the owner of this hotel?

1200
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:50,293
Oh, you changed the subject?

1201
00:56:50,543 --> 00:56:52,217
Don't you know?

1202
00:56:52,306 --> 00:56:54,822
Tiller gets the land, worker becomes the owner.

1203
00:56:54,847 --> 00:56:57,508
Why couldn't you have written all these in your Gita?

1204
00:56:57,868 --> 00:57:00,178
Listen to me Krishnaswamy.

1205
00:57:00,385 --> 00:57:05,569
Adding all these points, release a new version of the Gita with newly added chapters.

1206
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:08,947
Thousands of copies will sell like set dosas.

1207
00:57:09,156 --> 00:57:10,331
Never mind that.

1208
00:57:10,786 --> 00:57:13,333
Tell me how is your family.

1209
00:57:14,059 --> 00:57:15,916
Is everyone happy?

1210

There is no dearth of happiness.

1211
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:22,215
Everyone's excited about the future. The heaven itself has landed in our home.

1212

By the way, how's your Udupi life?

1213
00:57:25,755 --> 00:57:27,945
Are Kumbaabhishekha being done?

1214
00:57:28,114 --> 00:57:29,725
Are Tulabhaaras being done?

1215
00:57:29,854 --> 00:57:31,552
Is money getting collected in your collection boxes?

1216
00:57:31,983 --> 00:57:33,379
If the collections are weak...

1217
00:57:33,477 --> 00:57:36,168
...call for some Yagnas and collect some more.

1218
00:57:36,193 --> 00:57:39,005
What need is there for all that?

1219
00:57:39,404 --> 00:57:41,785
You don't know how to live Krishnaswamy.

1220
00:57:41,899 --> 00:57:46,994
People are making money by printing the same Gita you told, you know?

1221
00:57:47,087 --> 00:57:52,508
They are earning both money and merits. That was my intention after all.

1222
00:57:52,568 --> 00:57:54,688
You just talk smartly.

1223
00:57:54,816 --> 00:57:55,753
But...

1224
00:57:55,945 --> 00:58:00,985
Like instant dosas and idlis, you barge in at any hour.
Don't you have anybody of your own?

You poor animal.

1226
00:58:03,389 --> 00:58:06,905
I have no beginning and end.

1227
00:58:07,423 --> 00:58:09,582
No father, no mother.

1228
00:58:10,126 --> 00:58:11,030
An orphan.

1229
00:58:11,326 --> 00:58:12,803
A wanderer without address.

1230
00:58:13,369 --> 00:58:15,067
What Krishnaswamy?

1231
00:58:15,394 --> 00:58:18,172
I know very well why you've come here today?

1232
00:58:18,197 --> 00:58:19,056
Why?

1233
00:58:19,081 --> 00:58:21,175
To collect that 551 rupees.

1234
00:58:21,343 --> 00:58:22,271
Am I right?

1235
00:58:22,384 --> 00:58:25,496
You thought of cutting into my today's collection.

1236
00:58:25,786 --> 00:58:27,230
But that's not possible.

1237
00:58:27,908 --> 00:58:30,503
The money I have is not enough to pay the instalments.

1238
00:58:30,633 --> 00:58:33,133
How will I pay your 551 rupees?

1239
00:58:34,223 --> 00:58:35,794
I don't need that money.

1240
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:36,988
Maadhu.

1241
00:58:37,601 --> 00:58:42,619
I know very well how and when to take that money from you.

1242
00:58:43,685 --> 00:58:47,463
I too know very well how and when to settle the dues.

1243
00:58:47,793 --> 00:58:48,674
Right.

1244
00:58:48,794 --> 00:58:51,802
I have to close the shop, you may please leave.

1245
00:58:56,176 --> 00:58:58,263
This man doesn't trouble you.

1246
00:58:58,813 --> 00:59:00,146
He listens to you.

1247
00:59:01,203 --> 00:59:03,656
Please come Srinivasayya.

1248
00:59:05,049 --> 00:59:06,121
Please sit down.

1249
00:59:06,242 --> 00:59:07,464
It's ok.

1250
00:59:07,489 --> 00:59:08,384
Please sit down.

1251
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:12,629
Are you well?

1252
00:59:12,971 --> 00:59:14,042
How is Radha?

1253
00:59:14,084 --> 00:59:15,989
She's alright.

1254
00:59:16,244 --> 00:59:20,260
You might know about our situation already, right?

1255
00:59:20,479 --> 00:59:22,582
My husband buying your hotel...

1256
00:59:22,915 --> 00:59:24,923
...I don't feel alright about it.

1257
00:59:24,948 --> 00:59:28,238
I'm not at all sad about it.

1258
00:59:28,263 --> 00:59:29,010
But...

1259
00:59:29,035 --> 00:59:32,304
...If Maadhu hadn't bought my hotel at that time...

1260
00:59:32,468 --> 00:59:34,801
...I would've suffered worse.

1261
00:59:34,955 --> 00:59:35,733
Let it go.

1262
00:59:36,058 --> 00:59:38,772
You seem to have overcome this somehow.

1263
00:59:38,797 --> 00:59:39,426
I'll bring coffee.

1264
00:59:39,451 --> 00:59:41,378
I don't drink coffee.

1265
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:42,692
Madam.

1266
00:59:45,387 --> 00:59:49,815
I feel very hesitant to ask something from Maadhuraya.

1267
00:59:50,454 --> 00:59:53,446
I thought of asking it through you.

1268
00:59:54,270 --> 00:59:56,794
If you can help me in this...

1269
00:59:56,866 --> 00:59:58,358
Please tell me...

1270
00:59:59,774 --> 01:00:01,655
We are what we are because of you.

1271
01:00:02,618 --> 01:00:03,260
Somehow...

1272
01:00:03,555 --> 01:00:05,325
...fate has kept us above and...

1273
01:00:05,883 --> 01:00:06,819
...you below.

1274
01:00:06,844 --> 01:00:08,560
Let it go.

1275
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:11,950
Tell me, Maadhu comes home for lunch, right?

1276
01:00:12,439 --> 01:00:13,328
Yes, he does.

1277
01:00:13,537 --> 01:00:16,910
I'll look after the hotel during those hours.

1278
01:00:16,944 --> 01:00:19,039
Madam, just one meal..

1279
01:00:19,079 --> 01:00:23,134
...just one meal and some 60-70 rupees salary would be  sufficient for me.

1280
01:00:23,324 --> 01:00:25,776
I'll somehow manage to live on.

1281
01:00:27,262 --> 01:00:29,072
You lived like a king.

1282
01:00:29,529 --> 01:00:31,449
How can you talk like this?

1283
01:00:31,858 --> 01:00:36,120
I have no other way if I have to lead an honourable life.

1284
01:00:36,384 --> 01:00:37,726
Otherwise...

1285
01:00:37,805 --> 01:00:40,250
I have to make Ambode, Nippattu and Chaklis...

1286
01:00:40,746 --> 01:00:43,556
...and sell them in Lalbagh park.

1287
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:45,313
Please don't say that.

1288
01:00:46,237 --> 01:00:47,412
Life has...

1289
01:00:47,824 --> 01:00:49,729
...both sun and shade.

1290
01:00:50,153 --> 01:00:51,716
Don't take this to heart.

1291
01:00:52,251 --> 01:00:56,125
Or else I'll have to send Radha to work.

1292
01:00:56,288 --> 01:00:57,788
Did Radha get her degree?

1293
01:00:58,058 --> 01:00:58,963
No.

1294
01:00:59,274 --> 01:01:00,854
My hands were tied.

1295
01:01:01,028 --> 01:01:03,306
And she had to drop out of college.

1296
01:01:03,524 --> 01:01:04,350
No problem.

1297
01:01:04,810 --> 01:01:07,302
We can look for an able groom and get her married.

1298
01:01:08,006 --> 01:01:11,260
I should've done all that when I had the chance.

1299
01:01:11,414 --> 01:01:15,144
I can't even think of her marriage with these empty hands.

1300
01:01:15,169 --> 01:01:18,076
Please don't worry about this.

1301
01:01:18,206 --> 01:01:21,976
I'll tell my husband and get this sorted.

1302
01:01:22,074 --> 01:01:26,328
I'll leave everything to you madam. Do whatever you think is right.

1303
01:01:26,494 --> 01:01:27,454
I'll take leave.

1304
01:01:27,693 --> 01:01:29,185
Tell her I asked about her.

1305
01:01:29,264 --> 01:01:29,931
Yes.

1306
01:01:42,477 --> 01:01:44,350
Looks like somebody had come.

1307
01:01:45,194 --> 01:01:48,107
Our Krishna Cafe former owner Srinivasayya had come.

1308
01:01:49,302 --> 01:01:51,722
Must have cried and told sob stories.

1309
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:53,091
What else can he do?

1310
01:01:53,569 --> 01:01:56,323
Self respect on one side and hunger on the other side.

1311
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:58,279
Muddukrishna.

1312
01:01:58,304 --> 01:02:00,297
Have you seen his daughter Radha?

1313
01:02:00,377 --> 01:02:01,274
No.

1314
01:02:02,379 --> 01:02:03,625
Haven't seen her properly.

1315
01:02:03,969 --> 01:02:06,953
If you want me to, I'll see her properly.

1316
01:02:07,116 --> 01:02:09,639
Not just you, I too have to come along with you.

1317
01:02:10,151 --> 01:02:12,048
Most importantly, time must come.

1318
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:14,328
Amma, what's your intention?

1319
01:02:14,735 --> 01:02:15,735
My wish...

1320
01:02:16,332 --> 01:02:20,038
Radha must become my daughter-in-law and like goddess Lakshmi...

1321
01:02:20,112 --> 01:02:21,810
...should fill this home with happiness.

1322
01:02:22,696 --> 01:02:24,132
I have to see.

1323
01:02:24,482 --> 01:02:25,775
You too have to see.

1324
01:02:26,237 --> 01:02:27,388
Mahalakshmi.

1325
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:28,413
Daughter-in-law.

1326
01:02:28,725 --> 01:02:29,526
What's all this?

1327
01:06:51,725 --> 01:06:54,177
All these letters have to be typed and posted today.

1328
01:06:54,202 --> 01:06:54,832
Understand?

1329
01:06:54,857 --> 01:06:55,729
Yes sir.

1330
01:06:56,668 --> 01:06:57,438
Hello.

1331
01:06:57,805 --> 01:06:59,876
What? Trunk call from Mangalore?

1332
01:06:59,901 --> 01:07:00,932
You want Maadhuraya?

1333
01:07:00,957 --> 01:07:03,133
It's Maadhuraya's secretary speaking.

1334
01:07:03,508 --> 01:07:05,611
Wait a minute. I'll give it to him.

1335
01:07:05,636 --> 01:07:06,614
Sir.

1336
01:07:07,696 --> 01:07:09,387
Take it easy, take it easy.

1337
01:07:09,626 --> 01:07:10,443
What's the matter?

1338
01:07:10,468 --> 01:07:11,864
Sorry sir.

1339
01:07:11,985 --> 01:07:13,977
Madhukar Shenoy has called from Mangalore.

1340
01:07:14,114 --> 01:07:14,781
Take this.

1341
01:07:15,528 --> 01:07:16,830
Hello, Mr. Shenoy.

1342
01:07:17,006 --> 01:07:17,721
How are you?

1343
01:07:19,310 --> 01:07:19,977
Fine.

1344
01:07:21,781 --> 01:07:23,947
Jackson won the jackpot? Very good.

1345
01:07:24,037 --> 01:07:25,196
What else?

1346
01:07:26,848 --> 01:07:27,499
Thank you.

1347
01:07:32,626 --> 01:07:33,459
Hello.

1348
01:07:33,706 --> 01:07:35,746
Proprietor of five star hotel speaking.

1349
01:07:36,097 --> 01:07:37,827
Sorry, his secretary speaking.

1350
01:07:38,195 --> 01:07:38,980
Whom do you want?

1351
01:07:39,418 --> 01:07:40,164
You want Maadhuraya?

1352
01:07:40,465 --> 01:07:41,632
You call yesterday.

1353
01:07:41,657 --> 01:07:44,189
Sorry, call him tomorrow. You'll get him.

1354
01:07:47,064 --> 01:07:47,850
Hello.

1355
01:07:48,921 --> 01:07:50,302
It's the secretary speaking.

1356
01:07:51,046 --> 01:07:53,157
What? You want to speak to him? Call tomorrow.

1357
01:07:57,822 --> 01:07:59,330
I visited Krishna temple.

1358
01:07:59,425 --> 01:08:00,251
Take this prasada.

1359
01:08:00,276 --> 01:08:00,983
Good.

1360
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:06,138
Thank you.

1361
01:08:06,601 --> 01:08:07,537
What's special?

1362
01:08:07,562 --> 01:08:09,635
Today is Krishna Jayanthi.
Don't you know that?

1363
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:10,430
Oh, I see.

1364
01:08:10,455 --> 01:08:11,162
Listen.

1365
01:08:11,273 --> 01:08:13,091
Come home for dinner.

1366
01:08:13,386 --> 01:08:14,243
Sir, apple juice.

1367
01:08:14,459 --> 01:08:16,142
I deliberately left it there.

1368
01:08:16,167 --> 01:08:17,359
How can you do that?

1369
01:08:17,709 --> 01:08:19,113
Have this. It's good for you.

1370
01:08:19,282 --> 01:08:22,759
Doctor has told that it increases fat in the body.

1371
01:08:22,784 --> 01:08:23,738
Nothing will happen.

1372
01:08:23,763 --> 01:08:26,530
The picture can hang only when the wall is strong.
Keep on drinking.

1373
01:08:28,262 --> 01:08:30,254
Then the wall drinks half...

1374
01:08:30,615 --> 01:08:31,766
...and the picture drinks half.

1375
01:08:32,734 --> 01:08:34,290
What do you see next to you?

1376
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:36,539
You're right.

1377
01:08:44,050 --> 01:08:46,630
So Ambuja, you say today is Krishna Jayanthi.

1378
01:08:46,655 --> 01:08:49,347
Then you'll fill the entire house with his footprints.

1379
01:08:49,406 --> 01:08:51,970
Yes. Why? Do you object it?

1380
01:08:51,995 --> 01:08:53,678
Yes, this is costly flooring.

1381
01:08:53,703 --> 01:08:55,044
That marble is from Japan.

1382
01:08:55,690 --> 01:08:56,468
Japan?

1383
01:08:56,501 --> 01:09:00,612
In this world, there's nothing more valuable than
Krishna's feet.

1384
01:09:00,637 --> 01:09:02,108
You mean our old house is better.

1385
01:09:02,133 --> 01:09:02,727
Yes.

1386
01:09:02,974 --> 01:09:04,910
We got here from there, right?

1387
01:09:05,302 --> 01:09:07,786
I've bought that house only for you.

1388
01:09:07,811 --> 01:09:09,778
And you can go there light a lamp everyday.

1389
01:09:09,803 --> 01:09:12,781
Where is your dearest son, Muddukrishna?

1390
01:09:12,806 --> 01:09:16,213
He went to the club with his wife Radha.

1391
01:09:16,543 --> 01:09:18,979
They're little ones. Let them fly like birds...

1392
01:09:19,004 --> 01:09:21,290
...and return to their nest whenever they like.

1393
01:09:21,315 --> 01:09:23,365
Yes, yes. Let them take time.

1394
01:09:23,916 --> 01:09:25,860
I understand what you mean.

1395
01:09:25,885 --> 01:09:28,545
Take your hand off! You act like you were married yesterday.

1396
01:09:28,570 --> 01:09:31,421
We were poor when we got married.

1397
01:09:31,645 --> 01:09:33,883
Even then, your cheeks were smooth like this.

1398
01:09:34,013 --> 01:09:35,457
Now, you have a daughter-in-law.

1399
01:09:35,531 --> 01:09:38,285
And even now, your cheeks are the same.

1400
01:09:38,310 --> 01:09:39,367
Don't play games. Let me go.

1401
01:09:39,392 --> 01:09:42,852
Back then, hunger didn't let me play any game.

1402
01:09:42,877 --> 01:09:45,181
Now, even if I have such wealth and prosperity...

1403
01:09:45,206 --> 01:09:46,397
There's still one thing missing.

1404
01:09:46,422 --> 01:09:47,073
What is it?

1405
01:09:47,098 --> 01:09:50,351
-It's been four years since our Muddukrishna's marriage.
-Yes.

1406
01:09:50,376 --> 01:09:51,578
There's no news of a baby.

1407
01:09:51,603 --> 01:09:52,991
-No.
-What do you mean, no?

1408
01:09:53,016 --> 01:09:54,795
Isn't there your Krishnaswamy?

1409
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:56,121
Give him an application.

1410
01:09:56,187 --> 01:09:57,766
Yes. You just keep seeing.

1411
01:09:57,791 --> 01:10:01,697
That same Krishna will be born here and play in a cradle.

1412
01:10:01,722 --> 01:10:03,781
Alright. I have no objection.

1413
01:10:03,806 --> 01:10:09,085
But our Krishna must not tease Gopikas' like this.

1414
01:10:09,296 --> 01:10:12,661
It's ok if the baby does it. But when you do it...

1415
01:10:12,686 --> 01:10:13,609
...it's not right.

1416
01:10:17,067 --> 01:10:19,750
Her words are sweet but packs a punch.

1417
01:10:20,634 --> 01:10:22,491
How are you Maadhuraya?

1418
01:10:22,516 --> 01:10:24,763
Oh, Paramatma Krishna. Please come.

1419
01:10:24,877 --> 01:10:25,893
What is this?

1420
01:10:26,219 --> 01:10:28,426
This new honour of Paramatma?

1421
01:10:28,450 --> 01:10:31,141
You called me Maadhuraya instead of Maadhu.

1422
01:10:31,201 --> 01:10:32,749
Give respect and take respect.

1423
01:10:32,774 --> 01:10:33,813
Because...

1424
01:10:34,123 --> 01:10:36,186
...you're a rich man you see.

1425
01:10:37,047 --> 01:10:38,602
Hey! Get up!

1426
01:10:41,298 --> 01:10:43,203
When you're meeting someone big...

1427
01:10:43,371 --> 01:10:46,308
...you must stand until they ask you to sit.

1428
01:10:46,757 --> 01:10:48,146
You don't have any manners.

1429
01:10:48,521 --> 01:10:50,568
What kind of a God are you if you don't have manners?

1430
01:10:50,983 --> 01:10:52,102
Now you sit.

1431
01:10:52,444 --> 01:10:54,159
Sit down, sit down.

1432
01:10:54,184 --> 01:10:55,130
Forgive me.

1433
01:10:55,481 --> 01:10:58,640
I just sat down thinking of something else.

1434
01:10:58,665 --> 01:11:01,539
Oh, what's so important that engages your thought?

1435
01:11:01,621 --> 01:11:05,058
I know. It's the 551 rupees.

1436
01:11:05,364 --> 01:11:07,998
I'm sorry. I don't have even a penny now.

1437
01:11:08,081 --> 01:11:10,788
I put all my money into buying this big Bungalow.

1438
01:11:11,831 --> 01:11:13,014
Beautiful Bungalow.

1439
01:11:13,643 --> 01:11:15,976
Don't think that I got this from your blessings.

1440
01:11:16,177 --> 01:11:17,066
I...

1441
01:11:17,091 --> 01:11:19,201
I worked hard and earned it.

1442
01:11:19,719 --> 01:11:21,830
My work and your work...

1443
01:11:22,072 --> 01:11:23,834
...don't you know they're the same?

1444
01:11:23,859 --> 01:11:24,860
Impossible.

1445
01:11:24,885 --> 01:11:25,790
How's it?

1446
01:11:26,790 --> 01:11:28,123
You too could've heard.

1447
01:11:28,587 --> 01:11:30,976
People who achieved great things...

1448
01:11:31,184 --> 01:11:33,152
...say it's all done with Krishna's help.

1449
01:11:33,362 --> 01:11:34,481
Is it so?

1450
01:11:35,793 --> 01:11:40,070
Only those who think that Krishna and they are different...

1451
01:11:40,274 --> 01:11:42,567
...think that they achieved everything.

1452
01:11:42,743 --> 01:11:44,227
Krishnaswamy!

1453
01:11:44,779 --> 01:11:49,065
A man thinks he and Krishna are same and commits a murder.

1454
01:11:49,369 --> 01:11:50,885
He gets caught by the police.

1455
01:11:51,103 --> 01:11:52,888
Goes to court and jail.

1456
01:11:53,264 --> 01:11:55,177
Only you escape.

1457
01:11:55,202 --> 01:11:58,139
Then, you and him are different, aren't you?

1458
01:11:58,277 --> 01:11:59,102
Not like that.

1459
01:11:59,930 --> 01:12:03,319
Shadows follow you only when it's bright.

1460
01:12:03,955 --> 01:12:06,638
Where will they be when it's dark?

1461
01:12:12,848 --> 01:12:13,570
Maadhu.

1462
01:12:14,047 --> 01:12:18,039
A washerman washes only your clothes, not you.

1463
01:12:18,282 --> 01:12:22,131
But you still say that they're your clothes.

1464
01:12:22,409 --> 01:12:23,330
Likewise...

1465
01:12:23,573 --> 01:12:27,010
Your body is like clothes to your Atma.

1466
01:12:27,451 --> 01:12:30,205
Sin is dirt on body.

1467
01:12:30,706 --> 01:12:32,254
While removing it,

1468
01:12:32,470 --> 01:12:34,494
...only body gets punished,

1469
01:12:34,670 --> 01:12:35,686
...and not Atma.

1470
01:12:35,711 --> 01:12:37,212
Nonsense!

1471
01:12:38,118 --> 01:12:39,824
I don't want your Vedanta.

1472
01:12:40,001 --> 01:12:43,040
You come and see my five star hotel.

1473
01:12:43,347 --> 01:12:45,514
I thought of taking you there when I first saw you.

1474
01:12:46,055 --> 01:12:48,246
You, a brahmin, came alone.

1475
01:12:48,493 --> 01:12:50,295
I thought it was a bad omen.

1476
01:12:50,472 --> 01:12:52,385
But I'm not a brahmin, Maadhu.

1477
01:12:52,690 --> 01:12:53,539
A cowherd.

1478
01:12:53,667 --> 01:12:54,802
I see!

1479
01:12:54,867 --> 01:12:57,066
So, you too have these communal beliefs.

1480
01:12:57,091 --> 01:12:57,876
No.

1481
01:12:58,053 --> 01:12:59,267
A belief of Karma(work).

1482
01:12:59,770 --> 01:13:02,111
A cowherd's work is to look after cows.

1483
01:13:02,366 --> 01:13:05,271
Meaning, looking after all domestic animals.

1484
01:13:06,156 --> 01:13:07,076
Maadhu.

1485
01:13:07,475 --> 01:13:08,872
Creation is Brahma's job.

1486
01:13:09,364 --> 01:13:10,562
Preserving is my job.

1487
01:13:10,851 --> 01:13:12,193
Destruction is Shiva's...

1488
01:13:13,004 --> 01:13:15,520
Your lecture is boring.

1489
01:13:15,545 --> 01:13:17,809
Come to my hotel. I'll show you cabaret.

1490
01:13:17,834 --> 01:13:19,375
I can't come now.

1491
01:13:20,148 --> 01:13:21,735
May be some other time.

1492
01:13:22,127 --> 01:13:23,071
By the way...

1493
01:13:23,460 --> 01:13:25,468
...when is your hotel open?

1494
01:13:25,493 --> 01:13:26,907
and when is it closed?

1495
01:13:26,932 --> 01:13:27,972
I don't know.

1496
01:13:27,997 --> 01:13:29,790
It's not closed at any time.

1497
01:13:30,048 --> 01:13:31,326
Krishnaswamy.

1498
01:13:31,588 --> 01:13:33,675
Mine is a five star hotel.

1499
01:13:33,963 --> 01:13:35,677
24 hour service.

1500
01:13:37,459 --> 01:13:39,110
He just vanished.

1501
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:42,993
He comes and goes whenever he likes.

1502
01:13:43,482 --> 01:13:44,783
That's alright.

1503
01:13:51,968 --> 01:13:53,547
Who is this?

1504
01:13:53,572 --> 01:13:54,968
Someone new. She has come to swim.

1505
01:13:54,993 --> 01:13:57,694
Japanese doll.

1506
01:13:57,719 --> 01:14:00,481
She touched me. My life is fulfilled now.

1507
01:14:03,933 --> 01:14:05,282
Sir, what is this?

1508
01:14:06,062 --> 01:14:07,481
Will you please come out of water?

1509
01:14:07,506 --> 01:14:08,157
Why?

1510
01:14:08,381 --> 01:14:10,786
There are many bathrooms in our hotel to take an oil bath.

1511
01:14:10,979 --> 01:14:11,860
Please come.

1512
01:14:11,981 --> 01:14:14,108
Who are you to tell me that? Go mind your business.

1513
01:14:14,412 --> 01:14:17,055
If you won't come now, I'll have to report to boss.

1514
01:14:17,866 --> 01:14:21,041
You think I'm a servant?

1515
01:14:21,298 --> 01:14:22,457
Go mind your business.

1516
01:14:23,221 --> 01:14:24,690
Boys, drag him out.

1517
01:14:29,744 --> 01:14:31,712
Welcome, Acharya.

1518
01:14:33,613 --> 01:14:35,232
May God grant all your wishes.

1519
01:14:35,981 --> 01:14:36,640
Take this.

1520
01:14:37,205 --> 01:14:38,673
-Please sit down.
-That's OK.

1521
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:41,128
We are happy that you visited the monastery this time.

1522
01:14:41,153 --> 01:14:43,098
Don't say so. I'm the fortunate.

1523
01:14:43,123 --> 01:14:47,220
Many monasteries have benefitted from you.

1524
01:14:47,803 --> 01:14:50,295
It's all Krishna's blessings.
What is my contribution in that?

1525
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:51,600
This Friday...

1526
01:14:51,642 --> 01:14:53,483
Senior Swamy is visiting the monastery.

1527
01:14:53,508 --> 01:14:56,120
You must come with your family.

1528
01:14:56,145 --> 01:14:57,448
You don't have to mention it.

1529
01:14:57,640 --> 01:14:59,791
We'll be present there in his service.

1530
01:15:00,064 --> 01:15:01,111
Radha.

1531
01:15:01,223 --> 01:15:02,747
-What is it mother?
-Come here.

1532
01:15:04,535 --> 01:15:06,250
My Daughter-in-law. Radha...

1533
01:15:06,275 --> 01:15:07,847
Acharya from the monastery. Greet him.

1534
01:15:07,872 --> 01:15:08,842
Hello, how do you do?

1535
01:15:08,867 --> 01:15:09,804
Krishna...

1536
01:15:10,519 --> 01:15:11,725
Bless her.

1537
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:13,487
Alright.

1538
01:15:13,712 --> 01:15:15,473
Take this.

1539
01:15:15,498 --> 01:15:16,221
Take it.

1540
01:15:16,786 --> 01:15:18,279
May God bless you with a son.

1541
01:15:19,059 --> 01:15:20,789
He wasn't feeling well from yesterday.

1542
01:15:20,878 --> 01:15:22,679
I didn't know what to do.

1543
01:15:22,713 --> 01:15:24,205
May he get well with this Prasada.

1544
01:15:25,128 --> 01:15:27,350
Radha, put this kumkum on.

1545
01:15:27,886 --> 01:15:29,013
Yes mother.

1546
01:15:29,618 --> 01:15:30,483
Bye.

1547
01:15:32,081 --> 01:15:34,946
You please don't mind her. She is like that.

1548
01:15:35,203 --> 01:15:36,536
That's alright.

1549
01:15:36,561 --> 01:15:39,752
At least she believes that the dog might get cured.
That's enough.

1550
01:15:39,859 --> 01:15:41,414
-I'll leave.
-Alright.

1551
01:15:42,457 --> 01:15:43,941
Krishna.

1552
01:15:51,688 --> 01:15:52,950
I finally tied it.

1553
01:15:53,212 --> 01:15:54,188
Radha.

1554
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:56,263
How is it?

1555
01:15:57,123 --> 01:15:58,401
I'll tie it.

1556
01:15:59,386 --> 01:16:00,854
You don't know how to tie a tie.

1557
01:16:00,879 --> 01:16:03,533
I know how to tightly embarrass(embrace).

1558
01:16:03,558 --> 01:16:05,639
Don't say anything.

1559
01:16:09,364 --> 01:16:10,205
How is it?

1560
01:16:10,979 --> 01:16:12,440
Eskalent!(Excellent!)

1561
01:16:12,465 --> 01:16:14,251
I'll listen to your every word from now on.

1562
01:16:14,443 --> 01:16:16,618
Be it tying the tie or my hands.

1563
01:16:16,986 --> 01:16:18,455
You are ever ready for this.

1564
01:16:18,528 --> 01:16:20,631
When will let go of this inferiority complex.

1565
01:16:20,656 --> 01:16:22,530
What is it that you're saying?

1566
01:16:22,555 --> 01:16:23,595
My god!

1567
01:16:24,581 --> 01:16:26,478
My god means....my god.

1568
01:16:26,503 --> 01:16:27,352
You!

1569
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:29,085
And I'm your god.

1570
01:16:29,562 --> 01:16:30,110
Is it right?

1571
01:16:30,246 --> 01:16:30,936
Nonsense.

1572
01:16:31,239 --> 01:16:34,327
I don't know if you'll understand it even I said it in Kannada.

1573
01:16:34,656 --> 01:16:36,473
Inferiority complex means...

1574
01:16:36,608 --> 01:16:38,314
...slave mentality.

1575
01:16:38,516 --> 01:16:40,166
It means being like you.

1576
01:16:40,191 --> 01:16:41,439
How is it a problem for you?

1577
01:16:41,464 --> 01:16:42,829
-It is a problem.
-What?

1578
01:16:42,854 --> 01:16:44,235
I have to explain everything to you.

1579
01:16:44,386 --> 01:16:46,243
I have to suffer you.

1580
01:16:46,418 --> 01:16:47,902
Wherever we go...

1581
01:16:47,942 --> 01:16:50,878
...my friends speak English really well.

1582
01:16:50,972 --> 01:16:53,242
But you keep gawking at everyone.

1583
01:16:53,595 --> 01:16:57,491
I will lose my life saving you from that disgrace.

1584
01:16:58,020 --> 01:16:59,234
Radha...

1585
01:16:59,576 --> 01:17:01,806
Wise men don't speak much.

1586
01:17:02,014 --> 01:17:03,093
I'm like that.

1587
01:17:03,229 --> 01:17:05,277
Same fridge and volume.

1588
01:17:05,302 --> 01:17:07,344
It's not volume, it's value.

1589
01:17:07,474 --> 01:17:10,252
Why do you speak of something you don't know?

1590
01:17:10,277 --> 01:17:13,097
I married you to learn all that, right?

1591
01:17:13,122 --> 01:17:16,162
You should've learnt first and then married.

1592
01:17:16,187 --> 01:17:20,272
Radha, no matter how much a woman learns,
she's still a fool in front of her husband.

1593
01:17:20,297 --> 01:17:22,354
...It is my mother's opinion.

1594
01:17:22,379 --> 01:17:25,896
That may be her opinion with respect to your father.

1595
01:17:25,921 --> 01:17:26,948
It's different with me.

1596
01:17:27,006 --> 01:17:29,062
Look, don't talk about my mother like that.

1597
01:17:29,087 --> 01:17:29,939
Why not?

1598
01:17:30,042 --> 01:17:32,582
She always meddles in my affairs.

1599
01:17:32,777 --> 01:17:34,356
We have to go to a party today.

1600
01:17:34,571 --> 01:17:35,921
She wouldn't let us go.

1601
01:17:35,946 --> 01:17:36,692
Why?

1602
01:17:36,941 --> 01:17:38,957
Some renowned swamiji is visiting, I'm told.

1603
01:17:39,053 --> 01:17:41,442
And I'm to wear the traditional Kacche Saree.

1604
01:17:42,811 --> 01:17:45,097
If I wrap that 9 yard saree around me...

1605
01:17:45,258 --> 01:17:47,465
...I'll look like a village fool.

1606
01:17:47,490 --> 01:17:48,069
Radha...

1607
01:17:49,930 --> 01:17:53,041
You can wear a saree or a lungi.

1608
01:17:53,258 --> 01:17:55,711
Put snow on your cheeks or lipstick on your lips.

1609
01:17:56,397 --> 01:17:57,850
Braid your hair tightly...

1610
01:17:58,010 --> 01:17:59,544
...or quarrel with your mother-in-law.

1611
01:17:59,751 --> 01:18:00,600
But...

1612
01:18:00,808 --> 01:18:03,427
...don't forget that you are the daughter-in-law of this home.

1613
01:18:03,469 --> 01:18:04,905
Mother!

1614
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:05,683
That...

1615
01:18:05,747 --> 01:18:06,636
Look...

1616
01:18:07,049 --> 01:18:09,310
Wear all the golden necklaces you want.

1617
01:18:09,580 --> 01:18:10,374
But...

1618
01:18:11,077 --> 01:18:14,378
...nothing will equal this mangalsutra, you see.

1619
01:18:15,025 --> 01:18:17,589
A woman must not think the whole world as her home.

1620
01:18:17,796 --> 01:18:19,629
But think her home as her world.

1621
01:18:19,654 --> 01:18:23,316
What is this mother? Whatever did I say now?

1622
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:25,400
Mother, she's still young.

1623
01:18:25,425 --> 01:18:26,695
She'll learn eventually.

1624
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:28,616
Let her be for a few days.

1625
01:18:28,641 --> 01:18:30,474
'You must let it go a bit before you pull it back'

1626
01:18:30,499 --> 01:18:33,479
Muddukrishna, you mustn't let it go too far.

1627
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:35,656
If you do, then it'll be difficult to catch it again.

1628
01:18:36,999 --> 01:18:38,555
Can't catch it again, she says.

1629
01:18:39,289 --> 01:18:41,757
Do you see how tightly I hold you?

1630
01:18:41,782 --> 01:18:43,417
Yeah, very powerful.

1631
01:18:47,622 --> 01:18:48,980
Maadhu...

1632
01:18:49,259 --> 01:18:50,703
What's the hot news?

1633
01:18:50,728 --> 01:18:52,792
Oh, come, come.

1634
01:18:53,192 --> 01:18:53,795
Sit down.

1635
01:18:55,607 --> 01:18:57,480
You'll live hundred years...

1636
01:18:57,895 --> 01:18:59,530
I was just remembering you.

1637
01:18:59,755 --> 01:19:01,819
Do you remember me?

1638
01:19:02,004 --> 01:19:05,100
When such a blunder has been committed, won't I remember you?

1639
01:19:05,277 --> 01:19:06,935
What is that blunder?

1640
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:08,676
It has come in the paper.

1641
01:19:09,099 --> 01:19:11,773
A bus which was bringing your devotees...

1642
01:19:11,990 --> 01:19:12,919
...fell into a gorge...

1643
01:19:13,109 --> 01:19:16,101
..10 died and 30 have been injured.

1644
01:19:16,583 --> 01:19:17,662
What is this?

1645
01:19:17,830 --> 01:19:20,108
Do you need anything more dreadful?

1646
01:19:20,357 --> 01:19:21,801
Krishnaswamy...

1647
01:19:21,976 --> 01:19:24,309
Is this how you protect your devotees?

1648
01:19:24,383 --> 01:19:25,487
Don't make haste...

1649
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:26,537
Read further...

1650
01:19:26,632 --> 01:19:28,068
What else is there? Nonsense!

1651
01:19:28,348 --> 01:19:30,832
"When enquired, it was found that the driver was drunk"

1652
01:19:30,857 --> 01:19:31,803
There in lies the secret.

1653
01:19:32,392 --> 01:19:34,590
Am I responsible for that accident?

1654
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:36,809
Just because one driver was drunk...

1655
01:19:36,929 --> 01:19:38,747
...why punish all the devotees?

1656
01:19:38,812 --> 01:19:40,733
That... is their fate.

1657
01:19:41,513 --> 01:19:42,640
Fate he says.

1658
01:19:42,761 --> 01:19:45,467
They were coming to see you and seek your blessings.

1659
01:19:45,739 --> 01:19:48,175
You brought such calamity down on them. Is this fair?

1660
01:19:48,402 --> 01:19:49,204
Look Maadhu...

1661
01:19:49,593 --> 01:19:50,458
A doctor...

1662
01:19:51,237 --> 01:19:52,769
...very popular...

1663
01:19:52,794 --> 01:19:54,930
...a very talented one too...

1664
01:19:55,584 --> 01:19:58,052
A patient with a disease progressed too far...

1665
01:19:58,405 --> 01:19:59,747
...comes visiting this doctor...

1666
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,723
...and dies at his door.

1667
01:20:02,003 --> 01:20:05,551
Now would you call that doctor incompetent?

1668
01:20:05,809 --> 01:20:08,388
You give the answers just like that.

1669
01:20:08,431 --> 01:20:10,018
Forget about my smartness.

1670
01:20:10,391 --> 01:20:12,026
How is your family?

1671
01:20:12,475 --> 01:20:13,665
Is everyone well?

1672
01:20:13,731 --> 01:20:15,588
Oh, everyone is happy.

1673
01:20:15,723 --> 01:20:18,651
Just yesterday, we bought a posh bungalow at Palace Orchards.

1674
01:20:18,767 --> 01:20:19,807
For our Muddukrishna.

1675
01:20:20,142 --> 01:20:21,761
There is nothing to worry.

1676
01:20:22,025 --> 01:20:22,898
But...

1677
01:20:23,225 --> 01:20:25,598
This income tax keeps...

1678
01:20:25,623 --> 01:20:26,901
Yes...yes...

1679
01:20:27,109 --> 01:20:28,823
As the earnings grow...

1680
01:20:29,167 --> 01:20:30,580
...so would the sufferings.

1681
01:20:31,074 --> 01:20:32,130
Look Maadhu...

1682
01:20:32,695 --> 01:20:33,719
Instead of evading tax...

1683
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:35,228
fudging accounts...

1684
01:20:35,309 --> 01:20:36,936
...and hiding,

1685
01:20:37,269 --> 01:20:38,746
...if you are sincere and honest...

1686
01:20:39,223 --> 01:20:41,644
...you would have peace and health.

1687
01:20:41,797 --> 01:20:43,092
Government will also appreciate that.

1688
01:20:43,259 --> 01:20:44,378
Nothing like that.

1689
01:20:44,434 --> 01:20:47,759
If we report less earnings and adjust it somewhere else...

1690
01:20:47,784 --> 01:20:49,015
...everything will be alright.

1691
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:50,526
Krishnaswamy...

1692
01:20:50,551 --> 01:20:53,131
We can do anything if we have money.

1693
01:20:53,156 --> 01:20:56,379
So, you still believe money can do anything.

1694
01:20:56,550 --> 01:20:59,034
Why do you worry about what I think?

1695
01:20:59,411 --> 01:21:02,260
Why?...You are talking to yourself?

1696
01:21:02,285 --> 01:21:04,714
Look Ambuja! Look who's here.

1697
01:21:04,828 --> 01:21:06,559
Your beloved Krishna.

1698
01:21:06,718 --> 01:21:08,133
Take the measurements of his feet.

1699
01:21:08,379 --> 01:21:09,331
Because...

1700
01:21:09,508 --> 01:21:12,396
...on Gokulashtami, you can print his feet as much as you like.

1701
01:21:12,421 --> 01:21:14,510
Why? Why are you talking nonsense?

1702
01:21:15,410 --> 01:21:16,513
Talking nonsense?

1703
01:21:16,887 --> 01:21:18,721
Look at Krishna sitting on the chair.

1704
01:21:19,511 --> 01:21:21,051
He isn't on the chair or the teapoy.

1705
01:21:21,432 --> 01:21:22,821
You've gone crazy.

1706
01:21:22,966 --> 01:21:24,355
You're talking nonsense.

1707
01:21:24,626 --> 01:21:25,697
Krishnaswamy!

1708
01:21:26,112 --> 01:21:27,566
Open your mouth and speak something!

1709
01:21:29,068 --> 01:21:31,425
It's hot outside. Let's go inside.

1710
01:21:32,134 --> 01:21:34,387
Looking at you talking to yourself...

1711
01:21:34,780 --> 01:21:37,320
...it seems like there's something wrong with your brain.

1712
01:21:37,672 --> 01:21:40,243
Come inside. I'll put some holy mantrakshata on your head.

1713
01:21:40,595 --> 01:21:41,286
What?

1714
01:21:41,630 --> 01:21:43,558
You'll put holy mantrakshata on me?

1715
01:21:44,092 --> 01:21:45,433
Krishnaswamy.

1716
01:21:45,729 --> 01:21:47,316
Look what you've done to me.

1717
01:21:49,185 --> 01:21:50,701
He vanished just like that.

1718
01:21:51,385 --> 01:21:53,552
I'll take care of you someday.

1719
01:21:53,792 --> 01:21:55,101
I'm scared.

1720
01:21:55,595 --> 01:21:56,865
Why are you acting like this?

1721
01:21:57,241 --> 01:21:58,987
You are scaring me.

1722
01:21:59,227 --> 01:22:00,196
Ambuja.

1723
01:22:00,473 --> 01:22:02,965
Your Krishna is truly a magician.

1724
01:22:02,990 --> 01:22:04,595
Ah? Let him be.

1725
01:22:08,544 --> 01:22:09,607
Let's go inside.

1726
01:22:12,405 --> 01:22:12,969
Come.

1727
01:22:21,311 --> 01:22:22,121
Hello.

1728
01:22:23,764 --> 01:22:24,224
What?

1729
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:27,599
Is it Gabbunata, oh sorry, Ganganath stores?

1730
01:22:27,624 --> 01:22:28,982
Mr. Ganappayya...

1731
01:22:30,397 --> 01:22:32,849
Send the items over as per the list.

1732
01:22:33,107 --> 01:22:35,298
Invoice it like I have instructed you.

1733
01:22:35,587 --> 01:22:38,206
I'll come and collect the rest of the money later.

1734
01:22:39,931 --> 01:22:40,487
Sir.

1735
01:22:41,150 --> 01:22:44,301
Didn't I tell you not to buy provision from Ganganath stores?

1736
01:22:45,726 --> 01:22:47,774
Who are you to tell me that?

1737
01:22:48,180 --> 01:22:49,037
Who am I?

1738
01:22:50,016 --> 01:22:52,563
I'm the manager of this Madhu Continental.

1739
01:22:54,171 --> 01:22:55,520
I'm the supervisor.

1740
01:22:55,734 --> 01:22:56,909
I'm above you.

1741
01:22:57,181 --> 01:22:58,340
Go see your work.

1742
01:22:58,691 --> 01:23:00,112
I know Mr. Srinivasayya.

1743
01:23:00,310 --> 01:23:01,017
I know that.

1744
01:23:01,406 --> 01:23:03,018
I have to do my job, right?

1745
01:23:03,557 --> 01:23:06,216
You took 3000 rupees that day.

1746
01:23:06,339 --> 01:23:07,823
Where is the voucher for that?

1747
01:23:07,970 --> 01:23:08,629
Account?

1748
01:23:09,121 --> 01:23:09,724
Voucher?

1749
01:23:11,354 --> 01:23:14,846
Who do you think you are asking all this?

1750
01:23:15,890 --> 01:23:17,652
You know who I am?

1751
01:23:18,155 --> 01:23:19,671
I'm Maadhuraya's relative.

1752
01:23:19,742 --> 01:23:20,306
I know.

1753
01:23:20,744 --> 01:23:21,808
If he trusts you...

1754
01:23:22,141 --> 01:23:23,435
...Maadhuraya's business...

1755
01:23:23,762 --> 01:23:24,549
...will surely lock out.

1756
01:23:25,163 --> 01:23:26,036
Let it be.

1757
01:23:26,171 --> 01:23:27,568
Give me the account and voucher.

1758
01:23:28,081 --> 01:23:28,969
Don't!

1759
01:23:29,295 --> 01:23:30,835
Don't poke your nose in my business!

1760
01:23:30,995 --> 01:23:32,019
Michael!

1761
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:33,614
Your time isn't good.

1762
01:23:33,648 --> 01:23:36,568
That day, you stopped me from taking a bath in the
swimming pool.

1763
01:23:36,593 --> 01:23:39,277
Today, you are asking me for account and voucher!

1764
01:23:39,393 --> 01:23:40,242
Why?

1765
01:23:40,425 --> 01:23:43,306
You act so arrogantly because employees listen to you?

1766
01:23:43,460 --> 01:23:46,317
Your tough act doesn't work with me.

1767
01:23:46,599 --> 01:23:47,853
You think whatever you like.

1768
01:23:48,148 --> 01:23:51,044
I have to inform the boss regarding these 3000 rupees.

1769
01:23:51,151 --> 01:23:52,302
I have to fulfil my responsibility.

1770
01:23:52,327 --> 01:23:54,675
What kind of boss is he? A tramp!

1771
01:23:54,899 --> 01:23:57,240
I was the boss of your boss.

1772
01:23:57,265 --> 01:23:58,187
Will you shut up!

1773
01:23:58,903 --> 01:23:59,569
You shut up!

1774
01:24:00,303 --> 01:24:01,398
Mr. Srinivasayya!

1775
01:24:01,837 --> 01:24:03,869
I'll also see who's the boss.

1776
01:24:04,293 --> 01:24:05,983
Get lost!

1777
01:24:07,533 --> 01:24:09,454
Oh Kalayya! What's the matter?

1778
01:24:10,029 --> 01:24:12,862
I wanted some money for my boy's exam fees.

1779
01:24:13,515 --> 01:24:15,967
-Your son is in SSLC, right?
-Yes.
-Very good!

1780
01:24:16,543 --> 01:24:18,710
Don't let your son become a cleaner like you.

1781
01:24:18,926 --> 01:24:19,854
Educate him well.

1782
01:24:20,013 --> 01:24:22,029
I've told Balu. Go and collect the money.

1783
01:24:22,596 --> 01:24:24,009
May you live peacefully sir.

1784
01:24:27,205 --> 01:24:28,665
Vaasu, Narayana, Krishna!

1785
01:24:29,279 --> 01:24:30,437
Isn't anybody there?

1786
01:24:31,447 --> 01:24:33,400
There isn't anyone when I need one.

1787
01:24:33,553 --> 01:24:35,212
Vaasu, Narayana, Krishna!

1788
01:24:35,237 --> 01:24:36,156
Maadhu.

1789
01:24:36,626 --> 01:24:37,571
Did you call me?

1790
01:24:38,154 --> 01:24:39,804
Oh, Krishnaswamy.

1791
01:24:40,712 --> 01:24:43,577
Don't you know when to play games with me?

1792
01:24:43,602 --> 01:24:45,427
I called my driver Krishna.

1793
01:24:45,452 --> 01:24:46,970
You are Udupi Krishna, right?

1794
01:24:46,995 --> 01:24:49,089
Udupi, Mathura or Dwarka...whatever it might be.

1795
01:24:49,482 --> 01:24:52,466
I come to whoever is calling me.

1796
01:24:52,491 --> 01:24:55,088
Yes, you'll come. You roam around all the branches.

1797
01:24:55,545 --> 01:24:56,966
Forgetting the head office.

1798
01:24:57,055 --> 01:24:58,785
Because it is a jail, right?

1799
01:24:58,834 --> 01:25:00,477
If called, I'm ready to come there too.

1800
01:25:00,502 --> 01:25:01,265
Yes, you'll come.

1801
01:25:01,796 --> 01:25:03,328
What help can I get from you?

1802
01:25:03,672 --> 01:25:06,188
I need to go to the Vidhanasoudha urgently.
I need a driver.

1803
01:25:06,346 --> 01:25:07,593
-You need a driver?
-Yes.

1804
01:25:07,842 --> 01:25:08,810
I'll drive.

1805
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:10,662
Krishnaswamy.

1806
01:25:11,108 --> 01:25:13,831
This is not Kurukshetra's Arjuna's chariot.

1807
01:25:14,031 --> 01:25:15,428
It's Impala car.

1808
01:25:15,721 --> 01:25:16,864
Let it be Maadhu.

1809
01:25:17,182 --> 01:25:18,039
Come let's see.

1810
01:25:31,091 --> 01:25:32,908
You too must have a car.

1811
01:25:33,131 --> 01:25:34,353
Krishnaswamy.

1812
01:25:34,448 --> 01:25:36,297
Do you have driver's license?

1813
01:25:36,437 --> 01:25:38,548
Because police might catch on the way.

1814
01:25:38,606 --> 01:25:42,455
Maadhu, haven't I told you that I'm not visible to others?

1815
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:44,181
Yes, I had forgotten.

1816
01:25:44,343 --> 01:25:46,248
However, you drive safely.

1817
01:25:46,470 --> 01:25:49,470
Because, there are a lot of children in our country.

1818
01:25:49,541 --> 01:25:50,747
They might run in front of the car suddenly.

1819
01:25:54,414 --> 01:25:56,462
You are Kaliyuga's Krishna.

1820
01:26:28,659 --> 01:26:30,009
Krishnaswamy.

1821
01:26:30,034 --> 01:26:33,048
Don't turn the car towards Rukmini's or Satyabhama's house.

1822
01:26:33,116 --> 01:26:35,124
Go straight towards Vidhanasoudha.

1823
01:26:47,566 --> 01:26:49,003
Krishnaswamy.

1824
01:26:49,028 --> 01:26:51,308
Do you know all the traffic signals?

1825
01:26:51,333 --> 01:26:54,151
If you get caught by the police,

1826
01:26:54,176 --> 01:26:55,566
...I won't bail you out.

1827
01:26:55,591 --> 01:26:57,106
Be careful!

1828
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:37,349
Krishnaswamy.

1829
01:27:37,629 --> 01:27:39,590
I have some urgent business.

1830
01:27:39,756 --> 01:27:42,502
Lock the car and give the keys to my driver.

1831
01:27:49,013 --> 01:27:51,036
Thank you Krishnaswamy, tata!

1832
01:27:53,716 --> 01:27:55,622
Whether you chide me or my father,
doesn't matter!

1833
01:27:55,647 --> 01:27:57,852
You have to dismiss Michael right now!

1834
01:27:57,877 --> 01:28:00,109
What wrong did Michael say?

1835
01:28:00,317 --> 01:28:03,460
He just repeated my father's words that
one must be honest and just.

1836
01:28:03,513 --> 01:28:08,489
Oh! Did your father earn all this money honestly then?

1837
01:28:08,514 --> 01:28:10,414
Don't say that!

1838
01:28:10,694 --> 01:28:12,686
He might not believe in God,

1839
01:28:12,741 --> 01:28:14,768
...but he has never strayed from the path of honesty.

1840
01:28:14,944 --> 01:28:16,102
You mean?

1841
01:28:16,205 --> 01:28:19,205
I am dishonest, right? All-right!

1842
01:28:19,230 --> 01:28:20,044
I'll leave!

1843
01:28:20,069 --> 01:28:20,917
Wait father.

1844
01:28:20,942 --> 01:28:23,307
Please dismiss Michael.

1845
01:28:23,643 --> 01:28:24,206
All right.

1846
01:28:24,669 --> 01:28:26,082
I'll dismiss him tomorrow.

1847
01:28:27,163 --> 01:28:32,988
Oh! Today I learnt that a woman's soothing words have so much power!

1848
01:28:33,122 --> 01:28:37,440
Son-in-law, I'm not bothered about what Michael said about me.

1849
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:40,770
Just that he insulted your father-in-law, I couldn't bear it.

1850
01:28:40,795 --> 01:28:42,940
And that is why I had to raise such hue and cry.

1851
01:28:43,045 --> 01:28:44,505
Are you satisfied now?

1852
01:28:47,105 --> 01:28:49,081
Yes, Maadhurao here.

1853
01:28:49,799 --> 01:28:51,459
Are they calling me to auditor's office?

1854
01:28:51,656 --> 01:28:53,918
I'll send the manager.

1855
01:28:56,962 --> 01:28:57,859
Hello!

1856
01:28:58,069 --> 01:28:59,109
Rao here.

1857
01:28:59,363 --> 01:29:00,498
From lawyer's office?

1858
01:29:00,801 --> 01:29:01,809
Contact them.

1859
01:29:03,015 --> 01:29:03,523
Thank you.

1860
01:29:04,599 --> 01:29:05,734
-Balu.
-Yes sir.

1861
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:10,342
-Take it easy, take it easy.

1862
01:29:10,430 --> 01:29:11,565
-Sorry sir.
-What's this?

1863
01:29:11,766 --> 01:29:13,742
All the calls are coming to me.

1864
01:29:13,767 --> 01:29:14,887
What do I have you people for?

1865
01:29:14,912 --> 01:29:15,672
To eat...

1866
01:29:16,041 --> 01:29:18,748
Sir, that property tax case that's been going on...

1867
01:29:18,811 --> 01:29:22,144
...the way it's going, it seems we may lose it.

1868
01:29:22,389 --> 01:29:25,597
-I wanted to bring to your attention...
-Don't bring anything to me. You handle them.

1869
01:29:26,988 --> 01:29:27,837
Then...

1870
01:29:28,195 --> 01:29:29,718
What's happened with our hotel strike?

1871
01:29:29,776 --> 01:29:31,689
Will the workers take back the notice or not?

1872
01:29:31,714 --> 01:29:33,373
Till the time Michael is hired back...

1873
01:29:33,557 --> 01:29:35,089
...this problem won't be solved.

1874
01:29:35,114 --> 01:29:37,761
If I take Michael back, my relative will go out!

1875
01:29:37,882 --> 01:29:39,692
I can't say anything to anyone in this house!

1876
01:29:39,772 --> 01:29:41,605
Everyone acts like they're the royals!

1877
01:29:41,853 --> 01:29:42,353
Sir.

1878
01:29:42,814 --> 01:29:43,956
Another thing.

1879
01:29:44,047 --> 01:29:45,865
That estate we bought in Madikeri...

1880
01:29:45,976 --> 01:29:48,103
...there's a small dispute there.

1881
01:29:48,813 --> 01:29:49,670
What is this?

1882
01:29:49,901 --> 01:29:51,814
You're letting out one bogeyman after another.

1883
01:29:51,839 --> 01:29:53,014
It's not me.

1884
01:29:53,199 --> 01:29:54,199
It's coming on its own.

1885
01:29:54,288 --> 01:29:56,756
Claiming that he is the owner of that estate...

1886
01:29:56,924 --> 01:29:58,408
...somebody has served us a notice.

1887
01:29:58,433 --> 01:30:00,338
Idiot! What was the lawyer doing?

1888
01:30:00,611 --> 01:30:02,230
Didn't he take his fees in bundles?

1889
01:30:02,788 --> 01:30:05,443
Why didn't he check the papers properly before it was registered?

1890
01:30:07,539 --> 01:30:08,975
My head is bursting!

1891
01:30:09,094 --> 01:30:10,190
I'm fed up.

1892
01:30:13,498 --> 01:30:14,807
Do you have the tablets?

1893
01:30:16,542 --> 01:30:17,883
-It's inside.
-Get it!

1894
01:30:24,576 --> 01:30:27,536
What if I have so much wealth? I don't have any peace.

1895
01:30:28,134 --> 01:30:29,737
What is it Maadhu?

1896
01:30:30,247 --> 01:30:31,834
Oh, you've come.

1897
01:30:31,892 --> 01:30:35,273
Looks like you heard what I said and you came.

1898
01:30:35,467 --> 01:30:38,324
I said that just like that. Come sit down.

1899
01:30:39,281 --> 01:30:40,027
Maadhu...

1900
01:30:41,854 --> 01:30:43,076
Sir...

1901
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:44,116
Tablets.

1902
01:30:55,457 --> 01:30:56,291
-Balu.
-Yes sir.

1903
01:30:56,529 --> 01:30:57,656
You go see your job.

1904
01:30:57,768 --> 01:30:59,371
We want to talk freely.

1905
01:31:01,461 --> 01:31:02,747
There's no one here!

1906
01:31:02,772 --> 01:31:04,193
You mean we two?

1907
01:31:04,218 --> 01:31:07,139
Be it two or more. That's none of your business. Get out!

1908
01:31:14,539 --> 01:31:16,364
What is it Maadhu?

1909
01:31:16,452 --> 01:31:17,737
You seem to be having a headache.

1910
01:31:17,762 --> 01:31:19,074
Nothing to worry.

1911
01:31:19,465 --> 01:31:21,251
I've just taken the tablets.

1912
01:31:21,442 --> 01:31:22,244
It'll be gone.

1913
01:31:22,984 --> 01:31:24,230
Krishnaswamy!

1914
01:31:24,565 --> 01:31:26,240
I don't want your lecture today.

1915
01:31:26,741 --> 01:31:28,241
Let's listen to the radio music.

1916
01:31:51,434 --> 01:31:54,108
This seems to be T R Mahalingam's flute.

1917
01:31:55,135 --> 01:31:58,881
You too have the flute. For what? Just to swat flies.

1918
01:31:59,719 --> 01:32:02,147
Can you play like Mahalingam?

1919
01:32:02,172 --> 01:32:05,669
He's playing because I asked him to.

1920
01:32:05,752 --> 01:32:07,689
This is what I don't like.

1921
01:32:07,714 --> 01:32:09,571
You mean to say he was your disciple?

1922
01:32:09,780 --> 01:32:11,693
People are always like this.

1923
01:32:11,718 --> 01:32:16,012
When someone makes a name for himself, people are quick to claim to be his patron.

1924
01:32:16,037 --> 01:32:17,992
And say that they trained him.

1925
01:32:18,295 --> 01:32:20,105
You too are like those people.

1926
01:32:20,885 --> 01:32:22,242
What's the need for me?

1927
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:25,991
My flute playing is famous all over the world.

1928
01:32:27,296 --> 01:32:32,376
"Krishna's flute's calling..."[a song] you mean this?

1929
01:32:32,670 --> 01:32:35,043
Seems like no one can play it in Gokula?

1930
01:32:35,226 --> 01:32:42,956
And since you're the only one there, they felicitate you as the master every year.

1931
01:32:43,982 --> 01:32:45,641
I'll stop the radio now.

1932
01:32:45,929 --> 01:32:48,596
Just play a bit of what Mahalingam played.

1933
01:32:49,511 --> 01:32:54,423
If I play the flute, cows from the street would come into your house.

1934
01:32:54,558 --> 01:32:56,081
Is it alright?

1935
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:57,732
Krishnaswamy.

1936
01:32:58,013 --> 01:33:00,981
The cows won't come because of your flute.

1937
01:33:01,181 --> 01:33:04,332
They come only when they see grass, bran or cinema poster.

1938
01:33:04,486 --> 01:33:05,899
You play it without any worries.

1939
01:33:07,437 --> 01:33:11,159
"The stove got lit after the cooking was done...
One learnt his lesson after everything was lost..."

1940
01:33:11,341 --> 01:33:11,945
...is the proverb.

1941
01:33:12,187 --> 01:33:13,647
You're going beyond the limits.

1942
01:33:14,139 --> 01:33:14,687
All right.

1943
01:33:15,436 --> 01:33:16,285
Your wish.

1944
01:34:02,908 --> 01:34:04,995
Krishnaswamy! Stop it!

1945
01:34:05,124 --> 01:34:06,831
Cows will come inside.

1946
01:34:07,372 --> 01:34:08,785
I told you before.

1947
01:34:09,285 --> 01:34:09,920
Did you listen?

1948
01:34:25,105 --> 01:34:26,867
I won't believe this.

1949
01:34:26,970 --> 01:34:28,240
This is not a flute.

1950
01:34:28,265 --> 01:34:29,227
Some magic wand.

1951
01:34:29,428 --> 01:34:32,587
Surely, you've got it from some sorcerer.

1952
01:34:32,676 --> 01:34:35,390
This is certainly a magic wand, Maadhu.

1953
01:34:36,124 --> 01:34:37,846
The melody that comes out of this...

1954
01:34:38,619 --> 01:34:40,453
...is holy Vedas to the wise men,

1955
01:34:41,328 --> 01:34:44,058
...and to wicked men, an enticing tune.

1956
01:34:45,333 --> 01:34:47,547
Yeah, you say it like it's a cinema song.

1957
01:34:47,724 --> 01:34:50,835
Let it be. It seems your work here is done. You may go.

1958
01:34:51,458 --> 01:34:53,450
Why do you think I came here?

1959
01:34:53,556 --> 01:34:58,628
I just said, by mistake, that I have no peace even with so much wealth.

1960
01:34:58,776 --> 01:35:00,935
And you came thinking I surrendered to you.

1961
01:35:01,167 --> 01:35:02,397
That's impossible.

1962
01:35:02,653 --> 01:35:03,708
Krishnaswamy.

1963
01:35:04,028 --> 01:35:05,949
There's always a challenge.

1964
01:35:06,083 --> 01:35:08,425
Let's meet again. Bye.

1965
01:35:15,222 --> 01:35:16,277
Krishna...

1966
01:35:16,889 --> 01:35:20,389
...forgot his 551 rupees today also.

1967
01:35:34,971 --> 01:35:35,963
Mr. Madhavrao.

1968
01:35:36,328 --> 01:35:38,209
You have high pressure.

1969
01:35:38,362 --> 01:35:39,536
Which pressure?

1970
01:35:39,561 --> 01:35:40,393
Blood pressure.

1971
01:35:40,627 --> 01:35:43,349
He's always had it.

1972
01:35:43,438 --> 01:35:44,533
Why do you worry?

1973
01:35:44,639 --> 01:35:46,289
There are new medicines now.

1974
01:35:46,345 --> 01:35:48,543
If you take them regularly, it can be controlled.

1975
01:35:49,087 --> 01:35:51,238
How did I get it?

1976
01:35:51,263 --> 01:35:55,590
Is it some birthday present to be gifted by someone?

1977
01:35:56,294 --> 01:35:59,746
It's all because of your bad habits.
What can anyone do about it?

1978
01:36:00,069 --> 01:36:04,370
Doctor, he used to grind batter in my hotel.

1979
01:36:04,676 --> 01:36:06,367
He didn't have it then.

1980
01:36:06,392 --> 01:36:09,090
He left that and caught the pressure.

1981
01:36:10,477 --> 01:36:12,938
Doctor has come to cure my disease.

1982
01:36:13,320 --> 01:36:15,384
Not to hear my life story.

1983
01:36:15,497 --> 01:36:17,172
-Do you understand?
-Yes, I understand.

1984
01:36:18,001 --> 01:36:20,564
Doctor, what all can he not eat?

1985
01:36:21,886 --> 01:36:23,909
Rice, salt, spicy food and ghee.

1986
01:36:24,117 --> 01:36:25,045
He can't eat these.

1987
01:36:25,452 --> 01:36:27,087
You said it right.

1988
01:36:27,217 --> 01:36:30,138
He has enormous fat. It has to be thinned down.

1989
01:36:30,288 --> 01:36:31,304
We shall thin it down.

1990
01:36:31,376 --> 01:36:33,257
But he should cooperate too.

1991
01:36:33,467 --> 01:36:35,701
Srinivasaraya!

1992
01:36:35,876 --> 01:36:39,177
He caught all these diseases acting like this.

1993
01:36:39,332 --> 01:36:43,698
Tell me doctor, after making me the supervisor of his 5 star hotel,

1994
01:36:43,756 --> 01:36:46,057
..why should he meddle with it any more?

1995
01:36:46,299 --> 01:36:48,989
He did it anyway and now suffers for it.

1996
01:36:49,765 --> 01:36:51,495
They all came with you.

1997
01:36:51,909 --> 01:36:54,759
Would you keep quiet until finish talking with the doctor?

1998
01:36:54,825 --> 01:36:57,158
I may keep quiet...

1999
01:36:57,375 --> 01:37:00,113
...but your pressure won't let you be.

2000
01:37:00,403 --> 01:37:05,197
Look at him! He always keeps shushing like this.

2001
01:37:05,312 --> 01:37:06,447
I'm quiet.

2002
01:37:06,582 --> 01:37:10,177
One minute. Keep quiet for just one minute.

2003
01:37:10,202 --> 01:37:11,849
Why should I?

2004
01:37:11,874 --> 01:37:13,699
Because I want to talk to the doctor.

2005
01:37:14,202 --> 01:37:17,568
Whatever are you going to talk with your loudmouth?

2006
01:37:17,991 --> 01:37:20,698
Can't you put a cork in his throat?

2007
01:37:20,875 --> 01:37:21,875
Sir...

2008
01:37:24,814 --> 01:37:25,878
Sorry sir.

2009
01:37:26,348 --> 01:37:27,300
Stop!

2010
01:37:28,876 --> 01:37:29,614
Doctor...

2011
01:37:30,233 --> 01:37:32,249
How does one get this disease?

2012
01:37:32,307 --> 01:37:33,450
There're only two reasons.

2013
01:37:33,881 --> 01:37:34,913
One is money worries.

2014
01:37:35,144 --> 01:37:36,088
Another is mental worries.

2015
01:37:36,366 --> 01:37:37,731
I have neither.

2016
01:37:37,813 --> 01:37:43,599
He babbles anything because of his pressure. Don't believe him doctor.

2017
01:37:43,915 --> 01:37:44,645
Yes sir.

2018
01:37:44,907 --> 01:37:50,543
Is there a schedule for one to know when the worries come and go?

2019
01:37:50,568 --> 01:37:53,279
Is there a secretary to let us know its arrival? No.

2020
01:37:53,418 --> 01:37:56,203
This mental worry is like a country's budget.

2021
01:37:56,293 --> 01:37:59,301
No one knows what's in it until it has come out.

2022
01:37:59,828 --> 01:38:00,559
Doctor.

2023
01:38:01,092 --> 01:38:05,569
Finance minister would know when the budget would come out, right?

2024
01:38:05,684 --> 01:38:07,240
That God is the finance minister.

2025
01:38:07,511 --> 01:38:12,876
You mean one needs to go to him to know about this disease, huh?

2026
01:38:14,130 --> 01:38:15,757
Shall I book you a ticket?

2027
01:38:25,014 --> 01:38:27,466
All the products made in our hotel,

2028
01:38:27,881 --> 01:38:32,055
...must be clean and tasty is our boss's order.

2029
01:38:32,704 --> 01:38:34,276
But Mr. Srinivasarao...

2030
01:38:34,643 --> 01:38:36,875
...asks me to use milk powder to increase the quantity.

2031
01:38:36,987 --> 01:38:38,653
I said it's impossible.

2032
01:38:39,442 --> 01:38:43,569
One day, he took an oil bath in our hotel's swimming pool.

2033
01:38:43,659 --> 01:38:44,580
Krishna!

2034
01:38:44,670 --> 01:38:46,432
When I told him not to do such things...

2035
01:38:46,543 --> 01:38:50,963
...he abused me, called me a fool, an idiot in English.

2036
01:38:51,813 --> 01:38:52,988
Even after all this...

2037
01:38:53,504 --> 01:38:54,844
...one who got suspended is...

2038
01:38:55,123 --> 01:38:55,654
...me.

2039
01:38:55,729 --> 01:38:58,293
Look, I trust you.

2040
01:38:58,318 --> 01:38:59,086
Thank you madam.

2041
01:38:59,733 --> 01:39:01,169
One day, my husband...

2042
01:39:01,426 --> 01:39:02,926
...forgot to bring...

2043
01:39:03,092 --> 01:39:05,354
...his 50 thousand rupees and you returned it safely.

2044
01:39:05,379 --> 01:39:06,960
I knew it then that I can trust you.

2045
01:39:07,821 --> 01:39:09,892
I don't think you're guilty.

2046
01:39:10,441 --> 01:39:12,071
I'll send for you again. Now you can leave.

2047
01:39:12,096 --> 01:39:12,777
Thank you madam.

2048
01:39:17,234 --> 01:39:20,560
So, it's decided that I'm the guilty one.

2049
01:39:20,677 --> 01:39:22,621
It looks so to me.

2050
01:39:22,853 --> 01:39:25,417
You told to add powder to milk?

2051
01:39:25,442 --> 01:39:27,221
Yes , I did.

2052
01:39:27,246 --> 01:39:29,277
So what was he losing in it?

2053
01:39:29,685 --> 01:39:32,653
He was going to use pure milk. I couldn't bear to see it.

2054
01:39:32,678 --> 01:39:35,634
Shouldn't we safeguard our money from being wasted?

2055
01:39:35,749 --> 01:39:37,788
If we use milk like he said...

2056
01:39:37,813 --> 01:39:41,272
...we'd have to shut our hotel business down.

2057
01:39:41,300 --> 01:39:43,054
That if we aren't honest,

2058
01:39:43,245 --> 01:39:46,165
...we'd have to shut our hotel down,

2059
01:39:46,848 --> 01:39:48,483
...is something you already know.

2060
01:39:48,546 --> 01:39:52,990
You have pleasure in reminding me of that, haven't you?

2061
01:39:54,067 --> 01:39:55,877
If I had pleasure in doing so...

2062
01:39:56,165 --> 01:39:59,831
...wouldn't I have done that when you came to our home asking for help?

2063
01:40:00,414 --> 01:40:01,351
Look Brother...

2064
01:40:01,763 --> 01:40:03,962
I don't want to meddle in this matter.

2065
01:40:04,777 --> 01:40:06,848
My husband's already unwell.

2066
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:10,946
Since I didn't want him to worry, I called Michael to enquire.

2067
01:40:11,401 --> 01:40:13,846
Is this some court to conduct inquiry?

2068
01:40:13,984 --> 01:40:15,095
Look Radha...

2069
01:40:15,510 --> 01:40:19,050
Even our president had to come to the court for an inquiry.

2070
01:40:19,380 --> 01:40:19,936
Do you know?

2071
01:40:20,039 --> 01:40:24,443
The same president was declared innocent. You know that too, right?

2072
01:40:24,468 --> 01:40:26,653
The judgement may differ in your matter.

2073
01:40:26,801 --> 01:40:29,364
So, do we not conduct any inquiry at all?

2074
01:40:29,389 --> 01:40:32,286
What is this mother?
Do we subject our own to an inquiry?

2075
01:40:32,407 --> 01:40:33,938
Can relatives and employees be equal?

2076
01:40:34,356 --> 01:40:37,873
He may be wrong. But how can we let our own take the fall?

2077
01:40:37,898 --> 01:40:40,559
Look, how does it matter if it's our own or others?

2078
01:40:40,664 --> 01:40:42,180
Is justice different for everyone?

2079
01:40:42,229 --> 01:40:43,403
Son...

2080
01:40:43,659 --> 01:40:46,175
Your mother has a great devotion for Krishna.

2081
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:48,638
We have to hear the Gita.

2082
01:40:48,918 --> 01:40:52,441
Is it written anywhere that we have to listen to all this?

2083
01:40:52,629 --> 01:40:55,235
We'll stay or leave as we like. Nonsense.

2084
01:40:56,062 --> 01:40:59,229
When the time comes, everybody has to leave.

2085
01:40:59,860 --> 01:41:02,312
Not even an ant or a mosquito accompanies one.

2086
01:41:02,337 --> 01:41:06,473
Oh, forget it. When we leave, elephants will come with us.

2087
01:41:06,580 --> 01:41:10,366
But why should we go the place which you're talking about?

2088
01:41:10,391 --> 01:41:13,585
Do we have blood pressure, diabetes or piles?

2089
01:41:13,889 --> 01:41:16,389
Or are we crazy to talk to sofa and walls?

2090
01:41:16,465 --> 01:41:18,187
Those who are, are still breathing...

2091
01:41:18,212 --> 01:41:18,901
Radha!

2092
01:41:34,633 --> 01:41:36,895
When your were unmarried,

2093
01:41:37,562 --> 01:41:41,664
...I arranged for your marriage.

2094
01:41:42,965 --> 01:41:44,393
In return,

2095
01:41:45,929 --> 01:41:53,053
...you now wish for my husband's death.

2096
01:41:53,684 --> 01:41:56,041
So be it.

2097
01:41:56,742 --> 01:41:58,154
If your wish is...

2098
01:41:59,504 --> 01:42:01,591
...the God's wish,

2099
01:42:03,170 --> 01:42:06,027
...so be it.

2100
01:42:07,143 --> 01:42:09,231
Well said, Ambuja.

2101
01:42:09,590 --> 01:42:10,963
Well said.

2102
01:42:12,227 --> 01:42:13,862
Looking at what's going on here,

2103
01:42:14,481 --> 01:42:16,798
...I don't know if it's a house or a fish market.

2104
01:42:17,503 --> 01:42:18,146
Look...

2105
01:42:19,139 --> 01:42:21,195
Aren't families like this?

2106
01:42:21,220 --> 01:42:23,467
Arguments come and go.

2107
01:42:23,492 --> 01:42:26,683
With the problems you have, why do you worry about these things?

2108
01:42:26,855 --> 01:42:29,744
But our family wasn't like this before, Ambuja.

2109
01:42:30,986 --> 01:42:34,525
Only after it sings that you know if it's a crow or a cuckoo.

2110
01:42:34,550 --> 01:42:36,188
What's this Muddukrishna?

2111
01:42:36,833 --> 01:42:39,191
What did you say to hurt your mother?

2112
01:42:39,305 --> 01:42:42,852
No, father...

2113
01:42:42,877 --> 01:42:43,846
Radha, you tell him.

2114
01:42:43,871 --> 01:42:45,372
I didn't say anything.

2115
01:42:45,515 --> 01:42:46,364
You tell him father.

2116
01:42:46,954 --> 01:42:49,573
It's nothing.

2117
01:42:49,598 --> 01:42:55,251
Your wife seems to think that I'm guilty in Michael's matter.

2118
01:42:55,276 --> 01:42:56,250
Srinivasrao.

2119
01:42:56,600 --> 01:42:59,282
I made you a supervisor only in name.

2120
01:43:00,039 --> 01:43:05,000
Couldn't you have just sat and enjoyed ordering people around?

2121
01:43:05,433 --> 01:43:08,171
Forget it. You scolded Michael and sent him out.

2122
01:43:08,621 --> 01:43:11,375
Can you manage a five star hotel?

2123
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:13,417
Do you think this is Krishna Cafe?

2124
01:43:15,094 --> 01:43:18,142
Krishna Cafe may seem to you lowly now.

2125
01:43:18,836 --> 01:43:22,351
But don't forget that you used to grind batter there.

2126
01:43:22,556 --> 01:43:27,080
One should also not forget that the owner came to the same grinder asking for a job.

2127
01:43:27,105 --> 01:43:31,051
Maadhu, all this wealth has gotten into your head.

2128
01:43:31,256 --> 01:43:33,748
And that is making you act crazy.

2129
01:43:33,821 --> 01:43:36,536
This ego has caused you all your sickness.

2130
01:43:36,561 --> 01:43:39,651
Your heart is filled with deceit and fraudulence.

2131
01:43:39,676 --> 01:43:41,359
You are a charlatan!

2132
01:43:41,384 --> 01:43:42,797
Srinivasrao!

2133
01:43:45,206 --> 01:43:46,738
Hold your tongue!

2134
01:43:47,335 --> 01:43:48,430
Hold your tongue!

2135
01:43:51,664 --> 01:43:53,331
You call me charlatan?

2136
01:43:53,398 --> 01:43:56,913
You call me a thousand names. I'll hear.

2137
01:43:56,938 --> 01:43:58,346
Don't call me a charlatan.

2138
01:43:58,990 --> 01:44:03,165
See Ambuja, he calls me a charlatan. Am I one?

2139
01:44:03,190 --> 01:44:06,932
You call me a charlatan? You are a charlatan.

2140
01:44:06,957 --> 01:44:09,498
You're father and his father are charlatans.

2141
01:44:09,523 --> 01:44:11,582
Let him call you whatever he likes. Don't bother.

2142
01:44:11,607 --> 01:44:14,304
He knows very well who is and isn't.

2143
01:44:14,329 --> 01:44:18,000
-You come.
-He calls me a charlatan?
-Let him call, you come.

2144
01:44:20,313 --> 01:44:22,218
Go, go!

2145
01:44:22,243 --> 01:44:27,444
He keeps talking to walls and furniture and he advises me.

2146
01:44:27,624 --> 01:44:29,886
I too have god.

2147
01:44:30,031 --> 01:44:33,253
In a framed photo. Get lost!

2148
01:44:34,521 --> 01:44:38,331
Ambuja! Don't be angry for what I say.

2149
01:44:39,603 --> 01:44:42,190
I may be older than you by some 5-6 years.

2150
01:44:43,393 --> 01:44:45,956
And it has been 5-6 years since we got this wealth.

2151
01:44:46,564 --> 01:44:49,000
And within that time, I got 5-6 diseases.

2152
01:44:49,623 --> 01:44:53,527
Though you have the diseases, let me have the pain.

2153
01:44:54,699 --> 01:44:58,794
When one eye gets dust in it, wouldn't the other also fill with tears?

2154
01:44:59,681 --> 01:45:01,364
We two are like that.

2155
01:45:01,755 --> 01:45:05,327
Ambuja, you are healthy and fit.

2156
01:45:05,352 --> 01:45:06,877
You know why?

2157
01:45:07,364 --> 01:45:08,594
To save me.

2158
01:45:10,200 --> 01:45:12,739
Who else is there for me in this world?

2159
01:45:13,283 --> 01:45:16,942
Your care is more effective than the medicines.

2160
01:45:17,311 --> 01:45:18,858
Ambuja...

2161
01:45:19,933 --> 01:45:20,822
Ambuja...

2162
01:45:20,974 --> 01:45:21,982
I...

2163
01:45:22,141 --> 01:45:24,482
I will get better, won't I?

2164
01:45:24,507 --> 01:45:27,637
Difficulties come to men and not trees.

2165
01:45:27,710 --> 01:45:30,250
These things affect everyone.

2166
01:45:30,380 --> 01:45:32,523
Don't worry.

2167
01:45:33,517 --> 01:45:34,120
OK.

2168
01:45:34,735 --> 01:45:36,632
-Go have your meal.
-Yes I will.

2169
01:45:36,910 --> 01:45:38,029
Take your tonic.

2170
01:45:39,159 --> 01:45:39,882
Take it.

2171
01:46:13,351 --> 01:46:14,335
Maadhu.

2172
01:46:15,816 --> 01:46:17,062
Krishnaswamy.

2173
01:46:17,383 --> 01:46:21,422
One of my devotees gave me this sweet pudding.

2174
01:46:21,934 --> 01:46:24,680
I remembered you and I came running.

2175
01:46:24,705 --> 01:46:25,430
Drink.

2176
01:46:30,119 --> 01:46:32,063
It'll have too much sugar.

2177
01:46:32,088 --> 01:46:33,255
I can't drink.

2178
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:35,414
Why? You have diabetes?

2179
01:46:35,439 --> 01:46:36,353
Yes.

2180
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:38,783
-Can't drink coffee too.
-Why?

2181
01:46:39,207 --> 01:46:40,214
Blood pressure?

2182
01:46:40,326 --> 01:46:41,587
Yes.

2183
01:46:41,612 --> 01:46:44,917
Then you can't eat anything but rice.

2184
01:46:44,942 --> 01:46:47,458
No, I can't even go near rice.

2185
01:46:47,621 --> 01:46:49,549
Just wheat porridge.

2186
01:46:49,574 --> 01:46:51,178
Wheat porridge to satiate hunger.

2187
01:46:52,094 --> 01:46:53,801
And ice water for thirst.

2188
01:46:54,191 --> 01:46:56,905
I can't touch ice water.

2189
01:46:57,036 --> 01:46:58,338
Eosinophilia.

2190
01:46:59,379 --> 01:47:01,410
Why do you talk standing?

2191
01:47:01,565 --> 01:47:02,287
Sit down.

2192
01:47:02,519 --> 01:47:04,320
I can't sit.

2193
01:47:04,615 --> 01:47:06,361
You please sit down.

2194
01:47:06,768 --> 01:47:09,022
Until the head of the family sits down...

2195
01:47:09,387 --> 01:47:13,006
...the guest can't sit down. It's not good manners.

2196
01:47:13,377 --> 01:47:13,916
Is it not?

2197
01:47:14,029 --> 01:47:15,283
Oh just sit down.

2198
01:47:16,460 --> 01:47:18,857
Why do you torture me?

2199
01:47:19,259 --> 01:47:22,704
But why are you not sitting down?

2200
01:47:22,856 --> 01:47:25,769
Piles!

2201
01:47:25,852 --> 01:47:28,614
You're the base of this world and I'm of diseased base.

2202
01:47:33,304 --> 01:47:35,345
Ayyo Paapa ['Poor fellow'- Paapa also means sin]

2203
01:47:35,615 --> 01:47:37,123
What's paapa?

2204
01:47:37,148 --> 01:47:38,007
I mean...

2205
01:47:38,946 --> 01:47:41,025
Usually the diseased people,

2206
01:47:41,614 --> 01:47:44,368
...say they're paying for their sins.

2207
01:47:44,656 --> 01:47:45,648
That's why I said that.

2208
01:47:45,675 --> 01:47:49,064
I don't think these are 'my' sins.

2209
01:47:49,828 --> 01:47:51,384
Look Krishnaswamy.

2210
01:47:52,150 --> 01:47:55,777
I who used to only walk, now, travel only by car.

2211
01:47:56,186 --> 01:47:57,654
Weight increased.

2212
01:47:58,036 --> 01:47:58,988
Pressure.

2213
01:47:59,666 --> 01:48:03,769
I got even the bathroom air conditioned and drank ice water everyday.

2214
01:48:04,274 --> 01:48:05,568
Eosinophilia.

2215
01:48:06,006 --> 01:48:08,902
I ate Almond sweets whenever I liked.

2216
01:48:09,119 --> 01:48:09,937
Diabetes.

2217
01:48:10,288 --> 01:48:12,026
Owner of a five star hotel.

2218
01:48:12,280 --> 01:48:14,034
Has friends among big people.

2219
01:48:14,108 --> 01:48:16,243
Started drinking with them too.

2220
01:48:17,144 --> 01:48:20,136
I ate chilli fritters without care.

2221
01:48:20,386 --> 01:48:21,187
Piles.

2222
01:48:21,872 --> 01:48:23,333
Krishnaswamy.

2223
01:48:25,771 --> 01:48:28,184
I did these to myself.

2224
01:48:28,459 --> 01:48:30,515
What is sin or merit in it?

2225
01:48:30,540 --> 01:48:31,674
Then...

2226
01:48:32,002 --> 01:48:33,748
You won't say that it's your sin?

2227
01:48:33,979 --> 01:48:35,392
Definitely not.

2228
01:48:35,534 --> 01:48:35,907
Fine.

2229
01:48:36,761 --> 01:48:37,999
-Maadhu.
-Huh?

2230
01:48:38,143 --> 01:48:39,627
What are these medicines?

2231
01:48:40,018 --> 01:48:43,891
These tablets are there to prevent me from making the final trip just yet.

2232
01:48:44,331 --> 01:48:46,863
Could you say the names of these medicines?

2233
01:48:48,344 --> 01:48:52,082
Why? Oh it's for you to use them when you're old.

2234
01:48:52,863 --> 01:48:53,887
OK.

2235
01:49:00,116 --> 01:49:01,878
Erythromycin.

2236
01:49:02,519 --> 01:49:04,153
Ledermycin.

2237
01:49:04,910 --> 01:49:06,616
Terramycin.

2238
01:49:07,181 --> 01:49:09,189
Streptomycin.

2239
01:49:09,454 --> 01:49:10,493
Achromycin.

2240
01:49:10,812 --> 01:49:11,757
Maadhu.

2241
01:49:12,314 --> 01:49:15,140
You said you won't say 'It's my sin'.

2242
01:49:15,572 --> 01:49:20,175
But you said 'my sin' five times.

2243
01:49:21,146 --> 01:49:23,226
Just in English.

2244
01:49:23,251 --> 01:49:25,029
When did I say it in Kannada?

2245
01:49:25,072 --> 01:49:27,001
What a devotion to Kannada.

2246
01:49:27,456 --> 01:49:28,996
Doesn't matter which language,

2247
01:49:29,267 --> 01:49:31,219
...you said and that's enough.

2248
01:49:32,056 --> 01:49:37,509
You just want to see me suffer and want to brag that you won.

2249
01:49:38,078 --> 01:49:41,078
That's not so easy Krishnaswamy.

2250
01:49:41,424 --> 01:49:42,361
Maadhu.

2251
01:49:43,069 --> 01:49:44,838
I don't have to win you.

2252
01:49:45,657 --> 01:49:47,975
You have to win yourself.

2253
01:49:49,059 --> 01:49:51,877
You have something in your mind.

2254
01:49:52,300 --> 01:49:53,888
Krishnaswamy.

2255
01:49:54,231 --> 01:49:54,930
A word.

2256
01:49:55,511 --> 01:50:00,534
Why don't you grant the wishes of everybody and let them go?

2257
01:50:01,024 --> 01:50:03,540
What will you lose?

2258
01:50:04,146 --> 01:50:06,352
I'm always ready to grant wishes.

2259
01:50:06,761 --> 01:50:07,522
But...

2260
01:50:07,754 --> 01:50:09,135
...those who got their boon,

2261
01:50:09,366 --> 01:50:11,310
...misuse it and...

2262
01:50:11,613 --> 01:50:13,565
...turn it into a curse.

2263
01:50:13,688 --> 01:50:14,973
That's my worry.

2264
01:50:15,284 --> 01:50:16,134
How's that?

2265
01:50:16,792 --> 01:50:18,252
You know the ant?

2266
01:50:18,501 --> 01:50:20,874
It sat on a meditation.

2267
01:50:21,050 --> 01:50:24,367
When I appeared and asked what he wanted,

2268
01:50:24,855 --> 01:50:28,221
...it answered, "Whenever I bite someone, death shall occur immediately".

2269
01:50:28,956 --> 01:50:31,329
I granted that.

2270
01:50:32,427 --> 01:50:33,038
What happened?

2271
01:50:33,858 --> 01:50:35,279
An ant bit me.

2272
01:50:35,804 --> 01:50:36,598
I killed it.

2273
01:50:36,749 --> 01:50:37,384
Now you see?

2274
01:50:37,663 --> 01:50:40,560
The boon it got turned into a curse.

2275
01:50:40,793 --> 01:50:46,587
Oh! Because it asked "death shall occur when I bite", it died.

2276
01:50:47,063 --> 01:50:49,618
You are very shrewd.

2277
01:50:49,643 --> 01:50:55,295
Now if those who got their boon, turn it into a curse, what can I do?

2278
01:50:55,320 --> 01:50:56,635
You mean?

2279
01:51:00,274 --> 01:51:01,282
Hello.

2280
01:51:01,736 --> 01:51:03,213
Is it from Bombay?

2281
01:51:05,096 --> 01:51:06,604
Tell them I'm home.

2282
01:51:07,847 --> 01:51:08,681
Maadhu.

2283
01:51:09,626 --> 01:51:12,134
You can call directly from Bombay?

2284
01:51:12,159 --> 01:51:15,105
If one has money, one can make a call to even America.

2285
01:51:15,346 --> 01:51:16,687
Krishnaswamy.

2286
01:51:17,174 --> 01:51:19,809
Make a call to Dwarka and talk to your Rukmini.

2287
01:51:20,114 --> 01:51:22,336
Tell me the number and I'll dial it for you.

2288
01:51:22,949 --> 01:51:25,894
No one should know my home's number but me.

2289
01:51:29,981 --> 01:51:31,052
Hello?

2290
01:51:36,377 --> 01:51:37,575
Right.

2291
01:51:39,752 --> 01:51:40,982
Krishnaswamy.

2292
01:51:42,421 --> 01:51:44,619
You dialled just zero and started talking?

2293
01:51:45,482 --> 01:51:52,617
The solar system, the orbits all are in the shape of zero, aren't they?

2294
01:51:54,086 --> 01:51:55,228
Hello.

2295
01:51:57,224 --> 01:51:58,661
Hang up.

2296
01:52:02,166 --> 01:52:03,650
Is everything alright?

2297
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:05,580
What is your family doing?

2298
01:52:05,901 --> 01:52:07,631
Making Butter masala dosa.

2299
01:52:09,355 --> 01:52:12,141
Then you have phone connection even in the kitchen?

2300
01:52:12,166 --> 01:52:13,048
Good, good.

2301
01:52:13,073 --> 01:52:15,526
Alright, then. You're not well.

2302
01:52:15,797 --> 01:52:18,083
You take rest. I'll leave.

2303
01:52:18,174 --> 01:52:19,571
Krishnaswamy.

2304
01:52:19,964 --> 01:52:23,646
You're not forgetting to take back the silver tumbler you brought.

2305
01:52:23,799 --> 01:52:26,823
Who will pay for the trunk call you made to Dwarka?

2306
01:52:26,848 --> 01:52:30,532
Deduct it from the 551 rupees you have to pay me.

2307
01:52:34,629 --> 01:52:40,915
Whatever he talks, he always ends up mentioning the 551 rupees.

2308
01:52:46,037 --> 01:52:47,014
From Dwarka?

2309
01:52:47,222 --> 01:52:48,960
Krishnaswamy has left.

2310
01:52:49,097 --> 01:52:51,311
Oh, I'm sorry. Is it from Bombay?

2311
01:52:53,880 --> 01:53:03,364
[Reciting Bhagavadgeeta- Chapter 6, Shloka 34]

2312
01:53:03,827 --> 01:53:04,780
Krishna,

2313
01:53:05,327 --> 01:53:07,232
...mind is volatile.

2314
01:53:08,013 --> 01:53:09,711
It is difficult to control it.

2315
01:53:09,983 --> 01:53:13,261
It always follows its foolish paths.

2316
01:53:13,286 --> 01:53:14,033
Mother.

2317
01:53:15,569 --> 01:53:17,966
What? Where are you two going?

2318
01:53:19,399 --> 01:53:21,137
Mother.

2319
01:53:21,337 --> 01:53:25,860
Father would be comfortable if we put him in a nursing home, right?

2320
01:53:26,065 --> 01:53:26,589
Why?

2321
01:53:27,700 --> 01:53:29,612
How has he troubled you?

2322
01:53:30,219 --> 01:53:33,433
What is so wrong with him that he should be put in a nursing home?

2323
01:53:33,993 --> 01:53:39,470
Oh, he wants to show his love for his father by doing this.

2324
01:53:39,529 --> 01:53:43,290
Go, go now. You and your smartness.

2325
01:53:45,502 --> 01:53:46,836
To suppress that...

2326
01:53:47,638 --> 01:53:49,312
...is like stamping air.

2327
01:53:49,337 --> 01:53:50,068
Mother.

2328
01:53:50,579 --> 01:53:51,912
It's an impossible task.

2329
01:53:52,007 --> 01:53:52,817
Mother.

2330
01:53:53,329 --> 01:53:53,813
What?

2331
01:53:54,671 --> 01:53:57,179
There's a bungalow lying empty in Palace Orchard.

2332
01:53:57,371 --> 01:53:59,078
How would it be if we lived there?

2333
01:53:59,118 --> 01:54:00,864
There is nothing wrong in it.

2334
01:54:01,463 --> 01:54:05,503
But I have to know what's so inconvenient here for you.

2335
01:54:06,358 --> 01:54:07,239
Nothing, mother.

2336
01:54:07,628 --> 01:54:09,437
The disease father has...

2337
01:54:10,027 --> 01:54:11,575
They're saying it's contagious.

2338
01:54:11,600 --> 01:54:12,474
What did you say?

2339
01:54:13,064 --> 01:54:15,976
You say his disease is contagious?

2340
01:54:16,001 --> 01:54:17,932
I didn't say it. Radha told me.

2341
01:54:17,957 --> 01:54:20,101
Not me. It's my father.

2342
01:54:20,389 --> 01:54:22,294
Muddukrishna.

2343
01:54:23,050 --> 01:54:24,915
Who are you saying this about?

2344
01:54:26,235 --> 01:54:28,052
It's not wrong if Radha says so.

2345
01:54:29,374 --> 01:54:33,366
She might just be concerned for her husband's health.

2346
01:54:34,284 --> 01:54:36,197
But don't you have any sense?

2347
01:54:37,359 --> 01:54:42,113
You're calling your father, contagious, for nothing.

2348
01:54:44,977 --> 01:54:46,366
Krishna.

2349
01:54:46,796 --> 01:54:48,256
You were young...

2350
01:54:49,236 --> 01:54:50,506
Then...

2351
01:54:50,609 --> 01:54:52,688
You had jaundice.

2352
01:54:53,573 --> 01:54:55,581
You were very critical.

2353
01:54:56,640 --> 01:55:00,441
Even when doctor advised him not to touch you...

2354
01:55:01,050 --> 01:55:03,217
...your father...

2355
01:55:03,750 --> 01:55:08,679
...held you in his arms day and night without sleep.

2356
01:55:10,155 --> 01:55:11,655
Such a person...

2357
01:55:12,444 --> 01:55:15,206
You abandon him now as a contagious person.

2358
01:55:15,851 --> 01:55:20,486
Now you're 20, you act like this. Wait till you're 60 and you won't be like this.

2359
01:55:21,024 --> 01:55:25,627
Because then there'll be another 20 year old to mock you.

2360
01:55:26,363 --> 01:55:28,022
Go, go away.

2361
01:55:28,047 --> 01:55:30,134
Set up a new family and go.

2362
01:55:30,811 --> 01:55:33,914
Look, I'm your mother.

2363
01:55:34,450 --> 01:55:37,966
When I die and you're called to light the funeral pyre...

2364
01:55:38,963 --> 01:55:43,050
...don't stay away from me.

2365
01:55:47,629 --> 01:55:52,002
Couldn't you find another way to tell her that we wanted to move to the Palace Orchard house?

2366
01:55:52,093 --> 01:55:54,093
I just said what you told me.

2367
01:55:54,118 --> 01:55:56,651
You don't know how to talk. Just do as I say.

2368
01:55:56,876 --> 01:55:58,034
Tell me.

2369
01:55:58,124 --> 01:56:00,092
From now on, don't open your mouth.

2370
01:56:00,117 --> 01:56:01,151
Good riddance!

2371
01:56:12,806 --> 01:56:13,711
Mother.

2372
01:56:13,853 --> 01:56:15,155
Give me that tumbler.

2373
01:56:16,183 --> 01:56:17,255
Why?

2374
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:18,803
It's been offered to God, has it not?

2375
01:56:18,828 --> 01:56:20,756
Then I want it. Give it to me.

2376
01:56:25,351 --> 01:56:26,463
Bland porridge!

2377
01:56:26,656 --> 01:56:28,513
What is this mother? Tell me the truth.

2378
01:56:28,873 --> 01:56:31,436
You have been eating this for past four-five months, have you not?

2379
01:56:31,461 --> 01:56:32,754
What's all this enquiry?

2380
01:56:33,616 --> 01:56:36,069
All the members of this family, sitting on the dining table,

2381
01:56:36,094 --> 01:56:38,616
... are devouring anything they like.

2382
01:56:38,691 --> 01:56:40,826
And when I call you to sit with us for dinner,

2383
01:56:41,033 --> 01:56:43,899
...you give this excuse of making an offering to God.

2384
01:56:44,586 --> 01:56:48,245
You are doing all this so that we won't know. Am I right?

2385
01:56:52,126 --> 01:56:53,864
If you come to know,

2386
01:56:54,072 --> 01:56:56,683
...you will feel bad about it.

2387
01:56:56,758 --> 01:56:59,353
Won't feel bad but I feel proud.

2388
01:56:59,530 --> 01:57:01,356
What is there to feel proud in this?

2389
01:57:01,559 --> 01:57:05,829
I feel proud for having the world's greatest mother.

2390
01:57:06,005 --> 01:57:07,878
What else can I feel proud about?

2391
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:08,635
Krishna.

2392
01:57:09,756 --> 01:57:11,756
The day I married your father,

2393
01:57:12,313 --> 01:57:14,631
...my life became wonderful.

2394
01:57:15,636 --> 01:57:18,961
When he cannot eat what he likes,

2395
01:57:19,191 --> 01:57:20,504
...why would I need this luxury?

2396
01:57:21,250 --> 01:57:23,163
Whatever things he is forbidden to eat,

2397
01:57:23,395 --> 01:57:25,101
...I too have stopped eating those.

2398
01:57:25,773 --> 01:57:26,670
Because...

2399
01:57:27,646 --> 01:57:29,456
I am living in his shadow.

2400
01:57:29,746 --> 01:57:30,174
Mother.

2401
01:57:31,309 --> 01:57:33,794
Who, in this age, would thank the tree that gives the shade?

2402
01:57:34,216 --> 01:57:36,026
They only see if it yields any fruit.

2403
01:57:36,855 --> 01:57:37,974
Even if that tree gives shade,

2404
01:57:38,230 --> 01:57:39,563
...or dry up and expose you to sun,

2405
01:57:39,977 --> 01:57:41,477
...you're still standing with it.

2406
01:57:42,901 --> 01:57:44,575
Who else cares like that?

2407
01:57:45,435 --> 01:57:46,419
Fool!

2408
01:57:47,447 --> 01:57:49,328
When her husband couldn't see,

2409
01:57:49,845 --> 01:57:52,662
...Gandhari tied a band around her eyes all through her life.

2410
01:57:53,126 --> 01:57:54,491
What is greater than that?

2411
01:57:54,516 --> 01:57:55,000
Mother.

2412
01:57:56,011 --> 01:57:59,511
Making everybody call my father a mad man and playing with his life,

2413
01:57:59,846 --> 01:58:01,251
...That God!

2414
01:58:01,420 --> 01:58:04,547
If I meet him, you know what I'll do?

2415
01:58:04,820 --> 01:58:09,756
You'll ask for your father to be rid of all these problems, won't you?

2416
01:58:10,039 --> 01:58:11,539
You're there to ask that.

2417
01:58:11,787 --> 01:58:12,581
That's enough.

2418
01:58:13,496 --> 01:58:15,345
No matter how many lives I am born in,

2419
01:58:16,093 --> 01:58:20,665
...I ask that you be my mother always.

2420
01:58:22,137 --> 01:58:23,772
I ask this from God.

2421
01:58:26,564 --> 01:58:27,302
Krishna.

2422
01:58:27,484 --> 01:58:28,675
Yes, mother.

2423
01:58:29,303 --> 01:58:34,652
This one word of yours is enough for me as a mother.

2424
01:58:35,159 --> 01:58:35,818
Mother.

2425
01:58:35,843 --> 01:58:38,310
This one word is enough...

2426
01:58:51,033 --> 01:58:52,550
At the age of eating and enjoying,

2427
01:58:53,217 --> 01:58:54,844
...poverty didn't let me.

2428
01:58:55,847 --> 01:58:57,316
When I got rich,

2429
01:58:57,498 --> 01:58:58,578
...health got upset,

2430
01:58:58,898 --> 01:59:00,548
...and the tasty foods are even further.

2431
01:59:00,781 --> 01:59:01,987
Maadhu.

2432
01:59:02,370 --> 01:59:04,148
You are talking to yourself?

2433
01:59:04,253 --> 01:59:05,166
You came?

2434
01:59:05,286 --> 01:59:06,104
Come, come.

2435
01:59:06,470 --> 01:59:07,820
I was just remembering you.

2436
01:59:08,266 --> 01:59:09,234
Please take this.

2437
01:59:20,612 --> 01:59:21,533
What is this?

2438
01:59:21,995 --> 01:59:25,273
You drank this porridge as if it was orange juice?

2439
01:59:25,348 --> 01:59:26,896
When given with love,

2440
01:59:27,429 --> 01:59:29,509
...even porridge is like elixir to me, Maadhu.

2441
01:59:29,876 --> 01:59:31,725
I didn't give it with love.

2442
01:59:32,324 --> 01:59:34,792
I thought you'd say no.

2443
01:59:35,754 --> 01:59:36,937
Krishnaswamy.

2444
01:59:37,343 --> 01:59:38,629
In temples,

2445
01:59:38,907 --> 01:59:41,621
...people offer all kinds of tasty foods.

2446
01:59:41,905 --> 01:59:43,666
If you partake of offerings made even once,

2447
01:59:43,938 --> 01:59:46,485
...no one will offer you anything from the very next day.

2448
01:59:46,894 --> 01:59:47,561
Maadhu.

2449
01:59:48,682 --> 01:59:50,793
When a mother feeds her child...

2450
01:59:51,271 --> 01:59:51,962
The child says,

2451
01:59:52,456 --> 01:59:55,511
'I will eat only if you eat'.

2452
01:59:56,206 --> 01:59:57,277
Then the mother,

2453
01:59:57,748 --> 02:00:01,375
...acts as if she took a bite and feeds the child.

2454
02:00:02,538 --> 02:00:03,364
I am...

2455
02:00:03,721 --> 02:00:04,729
...like that mother.

2456
02:00:06,700 --> 02:00:07,994
Ready-made reply!

2457
02:00:08,194 --> 02:00:09,361
Comes without any delay.

2458
02:00:10,205 --> 02:00:11,300
Krishnaswamy.

2459
02:00:11,532 --> 02:00:14,365
I want to speak with you privately.

2460
02:00:14,415 --> 02:00:16,185
What is so private?

2461
02:00:16,370 --> 02:00:17,640
Nothing serious...

2462
02:00:17,832 --> 02:00:19,681
Looking at me talking with you...

2463
02:00:20,110 --> 02:00:22,308
...everyone thinks I've gone crazy.

2464
02:00:23,575 --> 02:00:24,583
My son,

2465
02:00:24,704 --> 02:00:28,418
...says that I should keep an ice pack to cool my head.

2466
02:00:28,763 --> 02:00:29,802
My relative,

2467
02:00:29,909 --> 02:00:33,798
...says that I should massage my head with lemon and take a head bath.

2468
02:00:34,182 --> 02:00:38,900
My daughter-in-law says that I'm possessed and I should go to Kollegala to be rid of the ghost.

2469
02:00:38,932 --> 02:00:41,035
Hearing all these,

2470
02:00:41,452 --> 02:00:42,729
...I get angry on one side,

2471
02:00:43,676 --> 02:00:45,017
... and sad on the other.

2472
02:00:45,042 --> 02:00:45,653
Father.

2473
02:00:45,933 --> 02:00:47,242
I got your tablets.

2474
02:00:53,477 --> 02:00:54,819
Why did I spin like that?

2475
02:00:57,030 --> 02:00:58,030
Take your tablets.

2476
02:01:00,907 --> 02:01:01,979
Did you see?

2477
02:01:02,077 --> 02:01:04,005
I don't know when he will get crazy.

2478
02:01:04,658 --> 02:01:05,872
Krishnaswamy.

2479
02:01:06,272 --> 02:01:08,375
Why can't you appear to him too?

2480
02:01:08,775 --> 02:01:12,386
Then he would stop spinning and giving me advice.

2481
02:01:12,872 --> 02:01:13,531
Maadhu.

2482
02:01:13,969 --> 02:01:19,239
When, where, how and whom to appear to,

2483
02:01:19,431 --> 02:01:21,876
...is for me to decide.

2484
02:01:22,002 --> 02:01:23,145
Krishnaswamy.

2485
02:01:23,616 --> 02:01:27,568
Your flatterers say that even for a leaf to shake, it must be willed by you.

2486
02:01:27,929 --> 02:01:28,850
Then,

2487
02:01:29,017 --> 02:01:31,683
...you're responsible for all the merits and demerits of everyone.

2488
02:01:32,022 --> 02:01:34,236
You're happy that you put me in a spot, right?

2489
02:01:34,858 --> 02:01:35,691
Maadhu.

2490
02:01:36,216 --> 02:01:37,740
Under a street light,

2491
02:01:38,004 --> 02:01:39,821
...one man writes a beautiful poem.

2492
02:01:40,148 --> 02:01:42,600
Another, schemes for a robbery.

2493
02:01:43,104 --> 02:01:45,183
The merits or demerits in these,

2494
02:01:45,692 --> 02:01:48,121
...goes to the respective person.

2495
02:01:48,473 --> 02:01:50,640
And not to that Government established street light.

2496
02:01:51,017 --> 02:01:51,977
Likewise,

2497
02:01:52,519 --> 02:01:54,456
..I'm like light everywhere.

2498
02:01:54,759 --> 02:01:55,299
That's all.

2499
02:01:56,793 --> 02:01:58,864
When you're everywhere like light,

2500
02:01:59,122 --> 02:02:01,376
...why is there a temple for you on every street?

2501
02:02:01,521 --> 02:02:04,044
When there's water underground everywhere,

2502
02:02:04,364 --> 02:02:07,046
...why are there taps in the kitchen and in the dining room?

2503
02:02:07,527 --> 02:02:09,106
Because, when one needs water,

2504
02:02:09,131 --> 02:02:11,028
...one doesn't have to go in search of it.

2505
02:02:11,053 --> 02:02:11,624
Is it not?

2506
02:02:11,649 --> 02:02:12,292
Very good!

2507
02:02:12,794 --> 02:02:14,294
An answer to every question!

2508
02:02:14,669 --> 02:02:15,748
Krishnaswamy.

2509
02:02:16,242 --> 02:02:19,385
I too have pestered you with many questions.

2510
02:02:19,753 --> 02:02:21,896
And have made you come to me quite a number of times.

2511
02:02:21,921 --> 02:02:22,937
I'm sorry.

2512
02:02:23,949 --> 02:02:28,417
I've decided to settle your 551 rupees today.

2513
02:02:28,874 --> 02:02:29,802
Come on, sit down.

2514
02:02:33,991 --> 02:02:34,657
Maadhu.

2515
02:02:35,673 --> 02:02:38,697
I've decided to stop coming here.

2516
02:02:39,002 --> 02:02:39,732
Why?

2517
02:02:40,220 --> 02:02:43,395
-I haven't settled your dues yet.
-No, Maadhu.

2518
02:02:44,072 --> 02:02:47,652
I got the money you owed me.

2519
02:02:47,766 --> 02:02:50,631
You got? When? How? Where?

2520
02:02:51,096 --> 02:02:54,612
You had a cleaner named Kalayya.

2521
02:02:54,933 --> 02:02:55,624
Do you remember?

2522
02:02:56,140 --> 02:02:58,505
How do you remember all this?

2523
02:02:58,770 --> 02:03:00,809
Yes, there was someone called Kalayya.

2524
02:03:01,519 --> 02:03:03,757
Poor man, he died.

2525
02:03:03,782 --> 02:03:06,822
Had you ever helped him?

2526
02:03:08,946 --> 02:03:09,573
Yes.

2527
02:03:10,122 --> 02:03:12,536
I had given some money for his son's clothes and education.

2528
02:03:12,665 --> 02:03:14,467
I gave money for his examination too.

2529
02:03:14,970 --> 02:03:16,145
Because,

2530
02:03:16,576 --> 02:03:18,718
...I didn't have money when my son was studying.

2531
02:03:19,181 --> 02:03:22,332
And by the time I got rich, he was all grown up and ready for marriage.

2532
02:03:22,867 --> 02:03:25,146
I thought at least Kalayya's son can benefit from my money...

2533
02:03:26,674 --> 02:03:30,460
Do you know how sweet it is to hear this sort of news?

2534
02:03:31,211 --> 02:03:34,790
There's no charity greater than giving education.

2535
02:03:35,579 --> 02:03:36,841
Do the math.

2536
02:03:37,319 --> 02:03:39,653
The amount you gave to Kalayya's son...

2537
02:03:40,101 --> 02:03:42,522
...is exactly 551 rupees.

2538
02:03:43,048 --> 02:03:45,365
From today, you're free of debt.

2539
02:03:45,758 --> 02:03:50,718
What is the relation between the money I gave him and the money I owe you?

2540
02:03:50,826 --> 02:03:52,239
There is a relation.

2541
02:03:52,748 --> 02:03:56,383
All the transactions of this world happens through me.

2542
02:03:56,952 --> 02:03:58,825
I'm the embodiment of Dharma.

2543
02:03:59,469 --> 02:04:02,104
Building a hundred temples,

2544
02:04:02,471 --> 02:04:05,193
...feeding a lakh people...

2545
02:04:05,610 --> 02:04:08,808
...and educating one man are all equal.

2546
02:04:09,124 --> 02:04:14,156
Somehow, you got your money back at last.

2547
02:04:14,271 --> 02:04:15,104
It's not like that Maadhu.

2548
02:04:15,790 --> 02:04:17,441
I'm the bank manager.

2549
02:04:18,069 --> 02:04:21,180
This 551 rupees that is deposited in your account now,

2550
02:04:21,723 --> 02:04:24,525
...can be spent happily in your next life.

2551
02:04:25,093 --> 02:04:25,997
Alright.

2552
02:04:27,411 --> 02:04:28,816
Now you can leave, right?

2553
02:04:28,928 --> 02:04:29,817
Why Maadhu?

2554
02:04:30,415 --> 02:04:31,502
Are you tired?

2555
02:04:31,583 --> 02:04:32,678
Then what else?

2556
02:04:33,609 --> 02:04:35,847
Asking stupid questions,

2557
02:04:36,175 --> 02:04:38,501
...drinking bland porridge,

2558
02:04:38,876 --> 02:04:40,535
...this naalige[tongue] has died.

2559
02:04:41,093 --> 02:04:42,260
What did you say, Maadhu?

2560
02:04:42,285 --> 02:04:44,595
I said this naalige[tongue] died.

2561
02:04:44,908 --> 02:04:46,971
This naalige[tongue] died.

2562
02:04:46,996 --> 02:04:48,013
Say that again.

2563
02:04:48,277 --> 02:04:51,221
This naa..li..ge died.

2564
02:04:51,246 --> 02:04:52,190
Meaning...

2565
02:04:52,486 --> 02:04:53,327
Naa [I]...

2566
02:04:53,541 --> 02:04:54,351
Illige [today]...

2567
02:04:54,440 --> 02:04:55,305
died.

2568
02:04:55,806 --> 02:04:57,290
You survived Maadhu.

2569
02:04:57,673 --> 02:04:58,523
I'll leave.

2570
02:05:02,768 --> 02:05:03,482
I won't come.

2571
02:05:03,649 --> 02:05:06,958
I'm not your better half, bitter half.

2572
02:05:07,050 --> 02:05:10,232
It's ok if you use English when you're scolding me.

2573
02:05:10,257 --> 02:05:12,331
You use English to curse yourself too?

2574
02:05:13,691 --> 02:05:15,437
You cracked a big joke.

2575
02:05:15,583 --> 02:05:17,162
You laugh at yourself. I'll leave.

2576
02:05:17,187 --> 02:05:17,726
Wait!

2577
02:05:19,206 --> 02:05:20,603
You dirty woman!

2578
02:05:21,136 --> 02:05:22,462
What arrogance!

2579
02:05:22,535 --> 02:05:23,885
What indecency!

2580
02:05:24,408 --> 02:05:26,534
You don't know how to behave or have learnt the manners.

2581
02:05:26,567 --> 02:05:28,107
You're an incarnation of indiscipline.

2582
02:05:29,740 --> 02:05:31,629
Go. Get the hell out here.

2583
02:05:31,654 --> 02:05:33,449
Don't show your face and never come back!

2584
02:05:33,926 --> 02:05:35,498
Radha.

2585
02:05:35,682 --> 02:05:39,126
You know why I tolerated your behaviour?

2586
02:05:39,407 --> 02:05:43,146
God would make the truth win at the end but waits.

2587
02:05:43,412 --> 02:05:45,635
God sees the truth but waits.

2588
02:05:46,107 --> 02:05:48,480
Tolstoy said this, you know?

2589
02:05:48,894 --> 02:05:49,608
Radha.

2590
02:05:49,746 --> 02:05:52,301
You insulted me because I didn't knew English?

2591
02:05:53,170 --> 02:05:55,583
I didn't learn just the Guitar from the manager, Michael.

2592
02:05:56,252 --> 02:05:59,530
I learnt English too to break your arrogance.

2593
02:06:00,249 --> 02:06:03,582
My dear better half, oh sorry...

2594
02:06:03,607 --> 02:06:05,910
...my dear bitter half.

2595
02:06:05,935 --> 02:06:07,564
Go to hell with your ego.

2596
02:06:07,589 --> 02:06:09,369
Don't come back.

2597
02:06:09,496 --> 02:06:12,393
Please forgive me.

2598
02:06:12,746 --> 02:06:15,135
I know English language only and...

2599
02:06:15,549 --> 02:06:16,970
...knew no music.

2600
02:06:17,576 --> 02:06:21,481
I know today that you know them both.

2601
02:06:22,413 --> 02:06:24,937
Please tell me that you've forgiven me.

2602
02:06:25,092 --> 02:06:25,853
Please.

2603
02:06:26,744 --> 02:06:27,823
Radha.

2604
02:06:27,936 --> 02:06:28,897
Mother.

2605
02:06:29,208 --> 02:06:30,200
Take this.

2606
02:06:30,782 --> 02:06:32,036
That bungalow's key.

2607
02:06:32,729 --> 02:06:35,546
You both can happily move into a new house.

2608
02:06:35,993 --> 02:06:38,644
I see that ability in you now.

2609
02:06:38,669 --> 02:06:41,084
Mother, Radha is not like before.

2610
02:06:41,109 --> 02:06:42,157
She's gotten wise.

2611
02:06:42,627 --> 02:06:45,183
She won't bring this up again.

2612
02:06:45,638 --> 02:06:46,741
From today,

2613
02:06:47,338 --> 02:06:48,949
...she's your true daughter.

2614
02:06:49,594 --> 02:06:50,999
Mother.

2615
02:06:51,024 --> 02:06:53,375
Because I studied in college,

2616
02:06:53,479 --> 02:06:55,678
...I thought I knew everything.

2617
02:06:56,363 --> 02:06:58,228
I know that that is wrong.

2618
02:06:59,359 --> 02:07:02,328
How a wife should follow her husband...

2619
02:07:03,458 --> 02:07:05,498
...I can learn that from you.

2620
02:07:06,191 --> 02:07:08,961
Please forgive my mistakes, mother.

2621
02:07:08,986 --> 02:07:11,225
Get up, get up, dear.

2622
02:07:11,250 --> 02:07:12,141
Why do you cry?

2623
02:07:12,222 --> 02:07:14,056
What has happened now?

2624
02:07:14,184 --> 02:07:16,406
Don't send us to another home.

2625
02:07:16,431 --> 02:07:18,496
Alright, I won't.

2626
02:07:18,975 --> 02:07:21,356
From today, you are the woman of the house.

2627
02:07:21,550 --> 02:07:24,256
I will just be with my husband.

2628
02:07:24,749 --> 02:07:26,305
Muddukrishna.

2629
02:07:26,912 --> 02:07:29,063
One should love one's wife.

2630
02:07:29,421 --> 02:07:32,747
But that doesn't mean he should tail her and dance on her commands.

2631
02:07:33,593 --> 02:07:34,362
Radha.

2632
02:07:34,650 --> 02:07:37,824
It's true that wife should go out and enjoy with her husband.

2633
02:07:37,986 --> 02:07:41,526
But she must not stick to him always.

2634
02:07:41,688 --> 02:07:45,783
If the tracks started running with train, it'll be disastrous.

2635
02:07:47,385 --> 02:07:50,512
You've become wise now. Go.

2636
02:07:53,120 --> 02:07:54,239
Muddukrishna.

2637
02:07:55,339 --> 02:07:58,260
I just now told you about not tailing your wife.

2638
02:07:58,811 --> 02:08:00,104
Yes, you did.

2639
02:08:00,129 --> 02:08:01,668
I'm supposed to go this way.

2640
02:08:15,358 --> 02:08:16,969
-Balu.
-Yes, sir.

2641
02:08:20,373 --> 02:08:21,778
-Take it easy.
-Yes sir.

2642
02:08:22,366 --> 02:08:23,279
Look.

2643
02:08:23,598 --> 02:08:25,646
I'm tired today.

2644
02:08:26,037 --> 02:08:27,989
-I'll look at these tomorrow.
-Yes sir.

2645
02:08:29,176 --> 02:08:29,803
Sir.

2646
02:08:30,424 --> 02:08:34,075
Madam has asked me to take the jeep and bring fruits and flowers.

2647
02:08:34,100 --> 02:08:35,171
Can I go?

2648
02:08:35,565 --> 02:08:37,247
A jeep to bring all these?

2649
02:08:37,614 --> 02:08:38,947
What's so special?

2650
02:08:38,972 --> 02:08:40,116
Today's Krishna Jayanti.

2651
02:08:40,141 --> 02:08:42,030
Kodubale, Chakkali, Nippattu...

2652
02:08:42,055 --> 02:08:43,650
Karigadubu, Kajjaya, Rave Unde...

2653
02:08:43,675 --> 02:08:46,334
We'll offer these to God but eat them ourselves.

2654
02:08:46,465 --> 02:08:47,552
May I go?

2655
02:08:48,436 --> 02:08:49,214
Go.

2656
02:08:59,603 --> 02:09:00,698
Krishna Jayanti.

2657
02:09:01,511 --> 02:09:04,932
All of you eat all the sweets and savouries.

2658
02:09:05,651 --> 02:09:08,881
But drown me in that bland porridge.

2659
02:09:08,906 --> 02:09:09,787
Krishna, Krishna.

2660
02:09:10,068 --> 02:09:11,409
Today's Krishna Jayanti.

2661
02:09:11,522 --> 02:09:13,022
Why do you talk of such things?

2662
02:09:13,812 --> 02:09:16,986
Once you get a little better, you too can eat them.

2663
02:09:17,011 --> 02:09:17,971
Tell me what of today.

2664
02:09:18,189 --> 02:09:19,911
Tell me what am I to do today.

2665
02:09:20,103 --> 02:09:20,905
Look.

2666
02:09:21,088 --> 02:09:25,421
I prayed to Kote Anjaneya and offered him a garland of Karigadubu for you.

2667
02:09:25,625 --> 02:09:27,854
And had Mandalotsava arranged for Goddess Annamma.

2668
02:09:27,879 --> 02:09:30,151
And sent money for Tirupati Brahmotsava.

2669
02:09:30,400 --> 02:09:33,360
And in Krishna's temple, today's decoration is offered by us.

2670
02:09:34,046 --> 02:09:34,975
Ambuja.

2671
02:09:36,153 --> 02:09:37,756
Hearing you,

2672
02:09:38,010 --> 02:09:41,875
...it's like an innocent child showering kisses on me.

2673
02:09:41,912 --> 02:09:43,325
Ambuja.

2674
02:09:43,350 --> 02:09:49,199
Just today, give me a bit of curd rice and a slice of mango pickle.

2675
02:09:49,387 --> 02:09:53,213
If you want, you can even wash the mango first.

2676
02:09:54,567 --> 02:09:55,868
Don't even think about it.

2677
02:10:01,042 --> 02:10:02,288
What sort of disease is this?

2678
02:10:02,369 --> 02:10:03,822
What kind of a body is this?

2679
02:10:08,829 --> 02:10:13,273
How heavenly will that curd rice be with a bit of mango pickle.

2680
02:10:13,518 --> 02:10:14,494
Then...

2681
02:10:14,884 --> 02:10:19,471
...a strong coffee with sugar added.

2682
02:10:19,496 --> 02:10:22,691
We've won our estate case.

2683
02:10:22,765 --> 02:10:24,153
Lawyer has telegrammed.

2684
02:10:24,201 --> 02:10:25,352
Didn't I tell you,

2685
02:10:25,377 --> 02:10:28,609
...that if we spend our money like water, we'll definitely win?

2686
02:10:28,859 --> 02:10:30,986
We spent and we won.

2687
02:10:32,497 --> 02:10:35,577
We spent and we won.

2688
02:10:35,602 --> 02:10:37,332
I say you get out.

2689
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:48,572
I too was one among the men who think money can buy anything.

2690
02:10:49,927 --> 02:10:52,507
What's the use if one has bundles of money?

2691
02:10:55,521 --> 02:10:57,807
Can one eat them?

2692
02:10:59,359 --> 02:11:02,192
When one is not lucky enough to eat what he likes,

2693
02:11:02,487 --> 02:11:08,630
...it's better to be a beggar than have all these riches.

2694
02:11:13,023 --> 02:11:15,095
When I used to grind dosa batter,

2695
02:11:15,120 --> 02:11:17,295
...I used to eat curd rice.

2696
02:11:18,291 --> 02:11:20,418
When I became a rich man,

2697
02:11:20,983 --> 02:11:23,380
...I lost the fortune of even touching it.

2698
02:11:24,074 --> 02:11:25,574
Looking at this,

2699
02:11:25,948 --> 02:11:29,432
...it feels that it is better to live in a cottage.

2700
02:11:33,036 --> 02:11:33,973
Krishna!

2701
02:11:39,853 --> 02:11:41,814
I surrender to you now.

2702
02:11:43,348 --> 02:11:46,880
You said you'd open my eyes through me.

2703
02:11:50,222 --> 02:11:53,341
My eyes opened through me.

2704
02:11:53,366 --> 02:11:56,272
Krishna, they were opened through me.

2705
02:11:58,579 --> 02:12:01,031
That day, I challenged you.

2706
02:12:02,694 --> 02:12:05,051
Today, I've lost.

2707
02:12:07,454 --> 02:12:08,637
Have lost it.

2708
02:12:09,623 --> 02:12:13,250
You're there in every being and everything.

2709
02:12:14,906 --> 02:12:19,113
I'm a worm in front of you.

2710
02:12:21,922 --> 02:12:24,295
What an arrogant man I am!

2711
02:12:26,204 --> 02:12:28,584
And how compassionate you are!

2712
02:12:28,873 --> 02:12:31,071
Krishna, Krishna!

2713
02:12:31,480 --> 02:12:34,702
You won! You won, Krishna!

2714
02:12:35,023 --> 02:12:38,420
You won, Krishna. You have won.

2715
02:17:40,288 --> 02:17:43,375
Why these tears?

2716
02:17:43,967 --> 02:17:45,125
Yes, Ambuja.

2717
02:17:45,429 --> 02:17:46,262
Tears.

2718
02:17:46,963 --> 02:17:47,883
But this...

2719
02:17:48,637 --> 02:17:51,169
...is the water that washed all the dirt off my heart.

2720
02:17:56,877 --> 02:17:57,631
Ambuja.

2721
02:17:58,918 --> 02:17:59,743
Ambuja.

2722
02:18:00,176 --> 02:18:06,128
I want to eat curd rice and mango pickle today.

2723
02:18:06,153 --> 02:18:07,393
Please bring some.

2724
02:18:07,418 --> 02:18:09,491
No. I beg you, please don't.

2725
02:18:09,516 --> 02:18:10,517
Ambuja.

2726
02:18:10,542 --> 02:18:14,367
If you are truly my wife,

2727
02:18:14,999 --> 02:18:16,665
...you've to bring it. Go.

2728
02:18:17,042 --> 02:18:18,757
Krishna, Paramatma.

2729
02:18:18,782 --> 02:18:20,496
What test is this?

2730
02:18:20,521 --> 02:18:23,284
I fall at your feet, please don't.

2731
02:18:23,309 --> 02:18:24,262
Would you bring or not?

2732
02:18:24,287 --> 02:18:25,511
Please listen to me.

2733
02:18:25,536 --> 02:18:26,258
Go.

2734
02:19:16,197 --> 02:19:17,491
Bring some ice water.

2735
02:19:19,098 --> 02:19:20,686
It's for me. Go bring it.

2736
02:19:20,711 --> 02:19:22,308
No. I feel scared.

2737
02:19:22,333 --> 02:19:23,293
Will you bring it or not?

2738
02:19:23,318 --> 02:19:24,255
-I will.
-Go.

2739
02:19:38,071 --> 02:19:40,174
That's enough.

2740
02:19:41,168 --> 02:19:42,660
-Give it.
-No.

2741
02:19:42,685 --> 02:19:43,987
I have to wash my hands. Give it.

2742
02:19:45,023 --> 02:19:45,943
Oh God!

2743
02:19:54,834 --> 02:19:55,509
Ambuja.

2744
02:19:56,258 --> 02:19:59,091
Bring me a hot coffee with sugar added.

2745
02:19:59,116 --> 02:20:00,380
You mustn't have sugar.

2746
02:20:00,405 --> 02:20:01,493
Just do as I say.

2747
02:20:01,518 --> 02:20:03,366
-Why won't you listen to me?
-Go.

2748
02:20:06,452 --> 02:20:07,436
I must listen to her.

2749
02:20:07,508 --> 02:20:09,190
Shouldn't she listen to me too?

2750
02:20:27,782 --> 02:20:29,377
Why are you acting like this?

2751
02:20:29,411 --> 02:20:31,927
You are doing everything the doctor has asked you not to.

2752
02:20:32,676 --> 02:20:34,557
Don't know what will happen.

2753
02:20:34,727 --> 02:20:38,775
That Krishna must save my husband now.

2754
02:20:44,229 --> 02:20:46,046
I offer everything to Krishna!

2755
02:20:46,629 --> 02:20:47,645
What?

2756
02:20:47,963 --> 02:20:50,201
Yes, that Krishna will take care.

2757
02:20:50,378 --> 02:20:52,735
You are saying this?

2758
02:20:52,865 --> 02:20:53,801
Yes.

2759
02:20:54,041 --> 02:20:56,501
What I'm saying now seems new to you.

2760
02:20:57,648 --> 02:21:00,029
Srinivasa Nayaka who was known as Navakoti Narayana,

2761
02:21:00,577 --> 02:21:02,029
...didn't he become Purandharadasa?

2762
02:21:02,405 --> 02:21:05,984
Didn't Meera drink poison with great faith in Krishna?

2763
02:21:06,393 --> 02:21:07,552
Draupadi...

2764
02:21:07,848 --> 02:21:11,332
When she called for help to save her honour, Krishna didn't appear...

2765
02:21:11,550 --> 02:21:16,542
...but when she said, her honour or shame,
all belonged to Lord Krishna,
didn't he appear and save her?

2766
02:21:17,429 --> 02:21:18,326
Ambuja.

2767
02:21:19,137 --> 02:21:21,478
Whoever understands oneself,

2768
02:21:21,656 --> 02:21:25,640
...Krishna has said, will have God appear to him effortlessly.

2769
02:21:26,240 --> 02:21:28,962
That Udupi Krishna himself has saved us.

2770
02:21:28,987 --> 02:21:30,710
He is so full of love.

2771
02:21:30,735 --> 02:21:32,602
How lucky am I.

2772
02:21:32,627 --> 02:21:35,580
I'm lucky too to have you as my husband.

2773
02:21:36,203 --> 02:21:38,115
Muddukrishna, Radha.

2774
02:21:38,563 --> 02:21:40,793
You two live here happily.

2775
02:21:41,201 --> 02:21:44,629
From today, all my properties belongs to you.

2776
02:21:44,798 --> 02:21:46,758
We always wish you well.

2777
02:21:46,793 --> 02:21:49,031
This house will not be the same if you leave.

2778
02:21:49,056 --> 02:21:52,453
Father, please forgive our mistakes.

2779
02:21:52,478 --> 02:21:54,061
Please don't leave us.

2780
02:21:54,095 --> 02:21:55,865
We're not leaving you.

2781
02:21:55,890 --> 02:21:57,921
We're just going back to our old house.

2782
02:21:58,631 --> 02:22:00,036
That is when I'll feel peaceful.

2783
02:22:00,433 --> 02:22:01,394
Am I right, Ambuja?

2784
02:22:01,984 --> 02:22:08,548
I knew that, some day, you'll decide to return to that house.

2785
02:22:09,569 --> 02:22:11,093
That's not old house.

2786
02:22:11,232 --> 02:22:13,010
It's my old school.

2787
02:22:13,273 --> 02:22:15,662
I'm the student of that old school.

2788
02:22:15,814 --> 02:22:16,632
Sir.

2789
02:22:19,136 --> 02:22:20,564
Take it easy.

2790
02:22:20,589 --> 02:22:22,122
My job?

2791
02:22:22,147 --> 02:22:24,171
Continue your service to Muddukrishna.

2792
02:22:24,315 --> 02:22:25,538
Thank you sir.

2793
02:22:27,502 --> 02:22:29,684
Take it easy.
