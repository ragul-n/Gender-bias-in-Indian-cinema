00:02:08,987 --> 00:02:10,244
They may be having some reason.

13
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:12,198
Why should I bother?

14
00:02:19,156 --> 00:02:20,237
Ask them.

Who are Marudu and Mari here?

What is the other person's name?

Yes...Murugesan. 
Where are they?

Sir! Why are you asking?

22
00:02:39,132 --> 00:02:42,349
Will you tell only if I say the reason? 
Where are those three? Tell.

23
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,430
They are rogues. 
And you have come in search of them.

24
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,283
Have they committed some serious crime?

25
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:53,045
Yes. They helped a girl and a boy to 
elope from this place yesterday night.

26
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:56,516
Girl's relatives complained 
to Police and are behind us.

27
00:02:56,808 --> 00:02:59,837
So we want to enquire them. 
Tell me where they are.

28
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:02,432
I guessed they must have done like this.

29
00:03:04,632 --> 00:03:06,046
They were here.

00:03:06,126 --> 00:03:10,554
They were drinking tea and 
murmuring something to the tea vendor.

Yes Sir. It is true. 
Do you know something?

32
00:03:15,402 --> 00:03:18,136
The tea vendor and 
those boys have some link.

33
00:03:18,216 --> 00:03:22,595
Ask him in a proper 
way and he will answer.

Why are they pointing at me?

35
00:03:25,718 --> 00:03:28,483
They may be talking about my tea!

-Yes Sir.

He is not answering us 
and is busy with his work.

43
00:03:48,697 --> 00:03:53,205
We know that you have 
links with those boys.

44

Otherwise you will be beaten to death.

and not answering me? Are you kidding?

48

Sir! You were speaking to them just now.

49
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,401
You allowed them to 
escape and are pestering me.

What?!

51
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:26,270
Yes Sir. They are the 
3 boys you were searching for.

52
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,882
Go and catch them.

53
00:04:28,044 --> 00:04:31,014
They do not allow me 
to run my shop in peace!

the right persons to you?

He belongs to our village. 
He will surely pinpoint us.

He is Maari. And he is Murugesan.

-Come. 
-Stop! I am asking you to stop.

-Come. 
-My leg is sprained.

You cannot run the shop 
peacefully so long as we are here.

-Who are they?

Two rowdies are chasing 
us since morning. Please save us.

00:05:59,054 --> 00:06:00,881
Why are the rowdies chasing you?

80
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:03,340
Don't know. We are students.

81
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,136
You should only help us.

82
00:06:05,216 --> 00:06:06,725
Okay. Go and sit there. 
I will take care.

83

Stop it!

84
00:06:09,595 --> 00:06:11,921
I said I will handle it. 
Why are you still crying?

85
00:06:12,001 --> 00:06:13,864
We are scared.

86
00:06:14,227 --> 00:06:15,661
Promise that you will save us.

87
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:16,854
Will hit you.

88
00:06:17,004 --> 00:06:18,548
How dare you ask a 
Policeman to promise you?

89
00:06:21,863 --> 00:06:23,822
Stop it! 
You want me to promise. Right?

90
00:06:23,997 --> 00:06:25,878
If anyone comes to beat you,

91
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:28,069
I promise on Goddess Kali

92
00:06:28,149 --> 00:06:32,551
that I will thrash him 
and put him behind bars.

93
00:06:32,631 --> 00:06:34,223
Are you satisfied now? Go and sit.

Wait. Wait.

You went in the morning to catch 
3 boys but have returned only now.

00:06:56,766 --> 00:06:58,324
They are here.

102
00:06:58,404 --> 00:07:00,553
-What are you saying? 
-Yes Sir.

103
00:07:00,748 --> 00:07:03,205
You said two persons are chasing 
you since morning. Who are they?

104
00:07:03,285 --> 00:07:04,494
It is them.

105
00:07:05,103 --> 00:07:06,862
You said something about 'rowdy'. 
What about that?

106
00:07:06,942 --> 00:07:08,403
They are these two persons.

107
00:07:08,687 --> 00:07:14,144
How dare you complain about 
Police and also accuse them?

108
00:07:14,224 --> 00:07:15,521
You should be put behind bars.

109
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:17,642
-Constable! Put them behind bars. 
-Yes. Lock them up. [laugh]

Sir! Please do not take hasty decision.

111
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,097
You are talking sarcastically.

112
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:22,674
You promised on Goddess Kali.

113
00:07:22,754 --> 00:07:24,844
Now if you go back on that, 
you will lose your eyesight.

114
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,895
Lose my sight! What are you saying?

115
00:07:28,087 --> 00:07:29,779
Goddess Kali is very ferocious.

116
00:07:32,384 --> 00:07:33,955
Why are you hesitating?

117
00:07:34,035 --> 00:07:38,101
Hand them over to me. 
I will handle them.

118
00:07:38,181 --> 00:07:39,884
Will you please shut up?

119
00:07:41,344 --> 00:07:43,928

me to find out his daughter!

Is she with me?!

00:07:47,171 --> 00:07:51,246
Sir! Honor is very important to us. 
Hand these boys over to us.

122
00:07:51,326 --> 00:07:52,786
We will thrash them in such a way that

123
00:07:52,866 --> 00:07:54,427
they will blurt out 
the location of the girl.

What shall I do now?

125
00:08:01,177 --> 00:08:02,789
Yes...

00:08:03,893 --> 00:08:08,839
They are right. I cannot beat them. 
I have promised them.

127
00:08:11,546 --> 00:08:13,350
Give a written statement 
and then take them.

128

-What is happening here? 
-Be quiet.

-Come. Let us go.

188
00:12:19,584 --> 00:12:22,854
Do not laugh loud. People here 
will thrash us if they come to know.

189
00:12:23,003 --> 00:12:25,993
As if they can! 
Even the Police were helpless.

190
00:12:26,073 --> 00:12:27,641
What will these people do to us?

191
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:31,596
Okay... But the bride and 
groom have still not come.

192
00:12:32,066 --> 00:12:35,479
Marudu has gone to bring. 
He will surely bring them.

193

Keep quiet.

Hop on.

196
00:12:42,281 --> 00:12:46,051
Problem will ease after some time. 
Come back after one year.

197
00:12:46,336 --> 00:12:47,982
It is getting late. Go.

198
00:12:48,062 --> 00:12:49,093
Okay.

199
00:12:49,385 --> 00:12:50,471
Who is that?

200
00:12:50,551 --> 00:12:51,963

-I will take care. You go.

Why are you taking her?

Where are you taking her? 
They are going to get married.

205
00:13:00,211 --> 00:13:03,677
Why are you shouting instead 
of blessing them? Go away.

206
00:13:03,757 --> 00:13:06,018
You are Chellathayi's son. Right?

207
00:13:06,437 --> 00:13:08,480
I know you. I know you.

208
00:13:08,626 --> 00:13:12,032
I have heard about your 
atrocities when I was in Dubai.

209

-Now that I have come back,

-Do whatever you want.

I will break your leg if 
you come near the dried fish.

216
00:13:40,531 --> 00:13:45,331
I saved money with great difficulty, 
bought fish and dried them to sell.

217
00:13:45,778 --> 00:13:47,434
But everyone wants to grab it.

218
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:52,577
You are drying fish here.

219
00:13:52,657 --> 00:13:56,268
But your son has been blamed 
for sending Murugesan's daughter

220
00:13:56,348 --> 00:13:59,979
and Kathiresan's 
son out of this village.

221
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:02,030
He is now standing as 
accused in Village Court.

222
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,243
Are you not going there?

223
00:14:04,323 --> 00:14:06,360
Whenever anyone elopes with a girl,

224
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,447
my son is blamed for that and 
produced before the Village Court.

225
00:14:10,527 --> 00:14:12,781
Wait. I will put an end to this today.

226
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,652
Why are you always 
appearing before the Court?

227
00:14:15,846 --> 00:14:17,354
You never listen to us.

228
00:14:18,003 --> 00:14:20,776
Tell us where you have 
sent the girl and the boy.

229
00:14:20,856 --> 00:14:23,678
Tell me if you are prepared to ask 
for pardon in this Court. Otherwise...

230
00:14:23,758 --> 00:14:25,689
Do you think they 
are going to tell the fact?

231
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:27,720
To hell with your Enquiry!

232
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,747
These boys have no other work. 
This happens every month...

233
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:32,464
And there is a crowd to watch it. Move.

234
00:14:33,355 --> 00:14:35,230
Why is she coming here?

235
00:14:38,058 --> 00:14:40,997
-Move! 
-Why is she dashing against us?

236
00:14:41,077 --> 00:14:42,346
Greetings!

237
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,900
What is happening here?

238
00:14:51,113 --> 00:14:53,647
Why have you assembled here 
and why have you accused my son?

239
00:14:55,684 --> 00:14:58,653
Look! Your son's 
behavior is not alright.

240
00:14:58,733 --> 00:15:01,609
Neither you are warning 
him nor do you allow us.

241
00:15:01,689 --> 00:15:05,280
You tell some excuse 
every time and take them away.

242
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,372
We will not release them this time.

243
00:15:07,452 --> 00:15:11,353
We have an eye witness this time 
and so we have called him for enquiry.

244
00:15:11,969 --> 00:15:14,880
Eye witness! Who is that?

245
00:15:17,976 --> 00:15:19,452
Please do not stare at me.

246
00:15:19,532 --> 00:15:22,980
Will I blame your son? It is 
the work of The Dubai-returned fellow.

247
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:28,866
How dare you speak against my son 
because you have earned some fast bucks?

248
00:15:28,946 --> 00:15:32,475
I saw your son sending them.

249
00:15:32,827 --> 00:15:34,834
Did you see my son sending them?

250
00:15:34,914 --> 00:15:36,333
With your eyes?!

251
00:15:36,578 --> 00:15:41,686
Okay. Tell correctly where your 
wife is standing amidst this crowd.

252
00:15:41,766 --> 00:15:45,111
Speak with respect to my husband. 
Otherwise I will cut your tongue.

253
00:15:45,191 --> 00:15:47,614
Of course I will speak 
in the same manner, You whore.

254
00:15:47,694 --> 00:15:50,929
You will be shamed 
if I disclose your activities

255
00:15:51,009 --> 00:15:54,000
while your husband was away in Dubai.

256
00:15:54,384 --> 00:15:58,418
We have lots of problems in our house. 
Why are you wasting time here?

257
00:15:58,498 --> 00:15:59,655
Come home.

258
00:15:59,735 --> 00:16:01,742
Such persons come 
to speak about Justice!

259
00:16:01,924 --> 00:16:05,167
She cannot bring up her son properly. 
But speaks about Justice!

260
00:16:05,247 --> 00:16:08,501
Who is that lady 
murmuring in this crowd?

261
00:16:08,806 --> 00:16:12,687
Oh! Is it you? 
Don't I know about your son?

262
00:16:12,767 --> 00:16:17,329
You were boasting that 
your son works in City.

263
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:20,825
But he brought a girl along 
with him when he came back.

264
00:16:20,905 --> 00:16:22,983
All of you listen to this.

265
00:16:23,063 --> 00:16:25,385
She is another man's wife.

Do not speak wrongly 
about my daughter-in-law.

268
00:16:29,413 --> 00:16:31,174
I will kill you.

269
00:16:31,961 --> 00:16:34,620
Can you kill me? 
Try to do.

270
00:16:34,977 --> 00:16:37,724

Did you hear her?

[indistinct crowd chatter]

272
00:16:47,281 --> 00:16:51,376
She is disclosing 
everyone's private matters.

273
00:16:51,456 --> 00:16:53,656
-Now she has started talking about you. 
-About me?!

274
00:16:53,736 --> 00:16:57,305
Yes. Before she shames you, 
better close the enquiry.

275
00:16:58,238 --> 00:16:59,626
Stop it!

276
00:16:59,706 --> 00:17:02,150
I said, 'Stop it'.

277
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:05,252
Henceforth if anyone comes to 
my house complaining about these boys

278
00:17:05,332 --> 00:17:06,559
I will break their limbs.

279
00:17:06,802 --> 00:17:11,211
-You may leave the place. 
-Go away.

280
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:14,050
We will handle you in the next enquiry. 
Go away.

-Come back home soon. 
-What she is saying?

282
00:17:17,443 --> 00:17:18,689

It is not good for you.

00:17:42,867 --> 00:17:45,722
Go. Wash your face and come to eat.

286
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:49,320
You and your daughter do 
not know anything other than food.

288

Why don't you understand?

289
00:17:53,068 --> 00:17:56,190
How can I tell your 
father to send you to study?

290
00:17:56,443 --> 00:17:57,893
It is difficult.

291
00:17:58,116 --> 00:17:59,950

But nobody in our house 
is allowing me to study.

299

You please explain to them.

Are you crying for this reason?

joined College elope with some guy?

Such things do happen. But we 
should not misjudge our own daughter.

O lightning like girl"

00:21:56,595 --> 00:22:00,285
"You are a real beauty"

352
00:22:00,365 --> 00:22:04,125
"I will lean on your 
bosom and live my life"

353
00:22:04,205 --> 00:22:08,777
You are a rogue. 
Why are you sitting here and smoking?

354
00:22:09,323 --> 00:22:12,546
Get up and move to that side.

355
00:22:12,626 --> 00:22:16,669
"I have fallen in love with you"

356
00:22:16,749 --> 00:22:20,532
"Come to me, My dear"

357
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:24,695
I am telling you. Don't you realize?

358
00:22:26,114 --> 00:22:28,364
Get up and move aside.

359
00:22:28,444 --> 00:22:33,360
"I love you, my dear"

360
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:38,052
"We are made for each other"

361
00:22:38,132 --> 00:22:41,863
"Cannot live without you"

362
00:22:42,055 --> 00:22:46,028
"O My love"

363
00:22:46,108 --> 00:22:50,294
"Shall I give my life for you? 
My love!"

364
00:22:52,117 --> 00:22:53,486
What are you doing?

365
00:22:53,658 --> 00:22:56,760
We will get whatever we 
ask for if we pray to this God.

366
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,102
I could join college 
because I prayed to this God.

367
00:23:00,552 --> 00:23:04,744
"I will change into a mirror"

368

only your figure in that"

[panting]

373
00:24:35,787 --> 00:24:37,064
You have betrayed me.

374
00:24:40,909 --> 00:24:42,057
Shit![bump]

375
00:24:47,324 --> 00:24:50,655
What are you thinking?

376
00:24:50,735 --> 00:24:54,063
You said the girl you saw 
in the bus was very beautiful.

377
00:24:54,143 --> 00:24:56,838
I am thinking which 
place she belongs to.

378
00:24:56,918 --> 00:25:02,920
She not only looks beautiful. 
She also speaks beautifully.

379
00:25:03,225 --> 00:25:04,985
'You are a rogue!'

380
00:25:06,468 --> 00:25:09,825
She attracted me with just one word.

381
00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:14,665
I don't mind to which place 
she belongs to or whose daughter she is.

382
00:25:14,906 --> 00:25:18,745
I will search her and 
express my love to her.

383
00:25:19,498 --> 00:25:22,062
Buddy! Is it love at first sight?

384
00:25:22,142 --> 00:25:25,083
It is called Love only 
if happens in first sight.

385
00:25:25,163 --> 00:25:26,977
What about others?

386
00:25:29,602 --> 00:25:31,062
Shut up.

387
00:25:32,248 --> 00:25:36,789
College is reopening tomorrow. 
Let us go home and sleep.

"I yearn for your look"

00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:18,199
He is acting as if this 
is the 1st day to his College.

"The heart filled with 
love flies like a paper in wind"

394
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:23,815
Stop dressing up.

00:26:23,895 --> 00:26:26,214
9o clock bus will come anytime now. 
Start fast.

396

-Bye. 
-Hey!

[water splashes]

400
00:26:44,623 --> 00:26:47,776
You are still a student. 
But you act like a rogue.

401
00:26:52,042 --> 00:26:53,054
Bend down.

402
00:26:56,206 --> 00:27:00,818
O Goddess Kali! May your son study 
well without indulging in any fight!

403
00:27:03,336 --> 00:27:04,497
Wait.

404
00:27:07,351 --> 00:27:08,908
Keep this money for your expense.

405
00:27:08,988 --> 00:27:12,683
You love me so much. Still 
why you are always scolding your son?

406
00:27:14,849 --> 00:27:16,043
Crazy boy!

[no audio]

408
00:27:48,564 --> 00:27:51,726
Look there! He is staring at you.

409
00:27:52,071 --> 00:27:54,311
I know it. Keep quiet.

410
00:27:54,585 --> 00:27:57,514
I have scolded him before. 
Now he is following me in bus.

411
00:27:57,788 --> 00:27:59,156
I am very scared.

412
00:28:21,715 --> 00:28:25,148
"You are looking at me"

413
00:28:25,681 --> 00:28:29,266
"For the first time."

"For the first time."

416
00:29:02,256 --> 00:29:04,300
What happened to him?!

417
00:29:04,672 --> 00:29:07,186
Keep quiet. Even I do not know.

418
00:29:07,266 --> 00:29:10,153
Get down. This is not your private bus.

419
00:29:10,233 --> 00:29:11,742
He is just not listening to us.

420
00:29:11,994 --> 00:29:13,591
Hey! I am telling you...

421
00:29:13,753 --> 00:29:15,382
It is getting late. 
We have to go for the next trip.

422
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:16,647
Tell him to get down.

423
00:29:17,361 --> 00:29:19,558
Buddy! Buddy!

424
00:29:25,696 --> 00:29:28,502
-Where is that girl? 
-Which girl?

425
00:29:28,688 --> 00:29:31,582
The girl whom I followed the other day.

426
00:29:31,662 --> 00:29:33,593
Did that girl travel in this bus?

427
00:29:33,673 --> 00:29:35,677
-Yes. 
-But I did not see her.

428
00:29:35,856 --> 00:29:38,969
All the girls from this 
bus have gone inside the College.

429
00:29:39,139 --> 00:29:40,428
That girl must have also gone there.

430
00:29:40,508 --> 00:29:41,810
Come with us. We will find out.[whistles]

My name is Poorani. 
And my native place is Solangarai.

I studied till 12th Std 
in Pattukottai Girls High School.

434
00:31:01,537 --> 00:31:02,949
You have a wonderful name!

435
00:31:03,662 --> 00:31:06,133
What are you doing here? 
Go to your class.

[yawning]

437
00:31:45,525 --> 00:31:46,789
Hey Marudu! Get up.

438
00:31:50,998 --> 00:31:53,009
What are you doing there 
without being attentive in class?

439
00:31:54,092 --> 00:31:55,909
Tell me. What did I teach now?

440
00:31:57,349 --> 00:31:59,100
Do not laugh. Tell what I taught now.

441
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,388
Sir! Am I handsome?

442
00:32:08,655 --> 00:32:10,309
He tortured me for 2 
years by asking this question.

443
00:32:10,471 --> 00:32:12,313
And now he is repeating 
the same question in the 3rd year.

444
00:32:47,406 --> 00:32:51,987
What do you want? 
Why are you following me?

445
00:32:53,285 --> 00:32:55,697
Hello! I am asking you...

446
00:32:57,105 --> 00:32:59,002
Why are you smiling at me?

447
00:33:00,785 --> 00:33:01,876
Insane!

448
00:33:03,095 --> 00:33:08,624
Hello! 
Just like me, you are beautiful too.

449
00:33:30,617 --> 00:33:33,819
Election date is announced to elect 
Committee for the Irrigation Department.

450
00:33:33,899 --> 00:33:37,062
Maniyar has been the 
Committee head since 5 years.

451
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:41,279
All of you know that 
because of his good deeds

452
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:45,243
agriculture is being carried 
out for all the 3 seasons.

453
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:49,881
I feel we can elect Maniyar 
as Committee Head for this term also.

454
00:33:50,205 --> 00:33:51,534
What do you feel?

here before the crowd.

459
00:34:10,254 --> 00:34:13,994
Tell me how much money he 
paid you for becoming the Head.

460
00:34:14,187 --> 00:34:15,638
I will pay more.

461
00:34:15,718 --> 00:34:17,511
You have a grown up daughter 
who is yet to be married.

462
00:34:17,591 --> 00:34:19,863
Shut up! Don't you have 
any respect for his age?

463
00:34:19,943 --> 00:34:22,839
Do not blabber. 
Have you come here to create problem?

464
00:34:23,803 --> 00:34:26,187
Do not interfere when we are talking.

465
00:34:26,901 --> 00:34:31,725
Why do you act as if he is the 
only MAN here to Head the Committee?

466
00:34:31,984 --> 00:34:35,041
Why are you always going behind him?

467
00:34:36,922 --> 00:34:41,479
Even I am a MAN. I am also like him. 
I am not going around naked.

468
00:34:42,623 --> 00:34:46,269
If he makes money in everything 
that is happening here,

469
00:34:46,349 --> 00:34:47,885
when will we get opportunity?

470
00:34:48,777 --> 00:34:52,223
Listen to me. It is my final decision. 
I am contesting this election.

471
00:34:52,775 --> 00:34:56,716
Let anyone oppose me. 
Then you will know who the real MAN is.

"My heart breaks like the pulse here"

473
00:35:07,246 --> 00:35:09,835

Where is Oomaiyan?

475
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:13,256
He is inside. Go and see.

476
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:17,142
"We were very close to each other"

477
00:35:20,204 --> 00:35:22,474
College is good. It is not about that.

478
00:35:23,064 --> 00:35:24,939
I told you the other day 
that I scolded someone. Remember?

479
00:35:25,555 --> 00:35:27,721
He is studying in the same 
College where I have joined.

480
00:35:29,666 --> 00:35:31,171
He did not create any problem.

481
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,253
But he is following me wherever 
I go and is laughing at me.

482
00:35:34,629 --> 00:35:36,426
Do you know what he did today?

483
00:35:36,822 --> 00:35:39,384
'Like me You are also beautiful.'

484
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:43,641
You have just returned from College.

485
00:35:43,721 --> 00:35:44,840
What are you telling him?

486
00:35:45,074 --> 00:35:46,262
Wash hands and come to eat.

487
00:35:46,342 --> 00:35:47,533
I will tell later.

488
00:35:48,852 --> 00:35:53,679
Is it proper to be discourteous 
to a respectable person in public?

489
00:35:54,315 --> 00:35:55,502
Who is Maniyar?

490
00:35:56,144 --> 00:35:59,037
He is related to you. It is 
not right to fight between yourselves.

491
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,315
I feel sad.

492
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:04,162
You are my mother's brother. 
So I was respecting you.

493
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:06,569
You eat food in our house.

494
00:36:06,913 --> 00:36:08,878
Is it not wrong to 
speak on behalf of Maniyar?

495
00:36:09,339 --> 00:36:10,655
Get up!

496
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:12,614
I said, 'Get up'.

497
00:36:12,991 --> 00:36:14,526
You will realize only when you 
suffer the consequence of your action.

498
00:36:14,606 --> 00:36:16,357
You will never reform. Get lost.

499
00:36:16,928 --> 00:36:18,511
Do not come back to eat.

[motorbike approaching]

501
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,151
You questioned my Uncle's masculinity.

502
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,848
Now I suspect whether you are a MAN.

503
00:36:40,997 --> 00:36:42,223
Take off your clothes.

504
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:45,433
-Remove it. 
-Hey!

505
00:36:45,513 --> 00:36:46,724
I said, 'Take your clothes off'.

506
00:36:47,893 --> 00:36:48,894
Go away.

507
00:36:48,974 --> 00:36:49,999
Hey!

508
00:36:50,175 --> 00:36:51,213
Go away.

509
00:37:34,653 --> 00:37:36,651
No! Please don't do it!

510
00:37:37,102 --> 00:37:38,176
No!

511
00:37:39,951 --> 00:37:42,484
Did you show off your valor 
to my Uncle when I was absent?

512
00:37:43,126 --> 00:37:44,480
Show me!

513
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,587

you beat him for my sake.

I feel very happy.

What do you think?

518
00:38:22,465 --> 00:38:24,386
Will I keep quiet if you are affected?

519
00:38:24,912 --> 00:38:27,654
Uncle! If you had a son and 
if someone had insulted you

520
00:38:27,734 --> 00:38:29,380
would he have kept quiet?

521
00:38:30,053 --> 00:38:31,821

slapped when he insulted you in public.

00:38:56,504 --> 00:38:57,925
You came back without reacting to it.

526
00:38:58,074 --> 00:39:01,888
Those who have daughters should 
not show off their courage in public.

527
00:39:02,283 --> 00:39:04,982
If we act hastily, we will be shamed.

528
00:39:05,313 --> 00:39:08,005
No one can harm my uncle 
so long as I am alive.

529
00:39:08,445 --> 00:39:11,734
You live like a King. 
I will support you. [pat]

530
00:39:13,263 --> 00:39:14,893
Have you not finished yet?

531
00:39:15,606 --> 00:39:17,301
It is getting late. 
Come and have dinner.

532
00:39:17,381 --> 00:39:18,946
Has my daughter eaten and fallen asleep?

533
00:39:19,238 --> 00:39:21,828
She took food and slept long back. 
You come down.

534
00:39:21,908 --> 00:39:23,328
You go. I will come.

535
00:39:31,291 --> 00:39:33,673
Bus has not yet come.

536
00:39:34,832 --> 00:39:36,545
It should have come by now.

537
00:39:38,288 --> 00:39:41,369
You were always late for the bus.

538
00:39:41,714 --> 00:39:45,261
But nowadays you come 
early and wait for the bus.

539
00:39:45,525 --> 00:39:48,190
You are a lucky guy. Enjoy.

540
00:39:48,504 --> 00:39:51,555
We are final year students.

541
00:39:51,635 --> 00:39:54,078
Should we not be a 
role model to our juniors?

542
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:57,261
That is why I am maintaining the time.

543
00:39:57,341 --> 00:39:59,430
We! As role model?!

544
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:01,416
They will not come up in life.

545
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:28,127
Bus will not come today. 
It has fallen into the Pond.

546
00:40:28,207 --> 00:40:30,509
All of you go back home.

547
00:40:30,589 --> 00:40:32,596
-Really?! 
-Yes.

548
00:40:35,375 --> 00:40:36,627
Nobody else is there in the bus.

549
00:40:36,707 --> 00:40:38,663
Everyone has been brought to the Bank. 
Hope none of them have any problem.

550
00:40:38,743 --> 00:40:41,213
No. They have fainted. 
That's all. Called for Ambulance.

551
00:40:55,655 --> 00:40:56,962
[splash]

552
00:42:05,873 --> 00:42:08,032
[motorbike approaching]

553
00:42:12,401 --> 00:42:14,631
[no audio]

554
00:42:24,399 --> 00:42:27,709
[panting]

555
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:34,417
[engine reviving]

556
00:42:42,425 --> 00:42:43,729
Hey!

557
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:01,031
What happened after that?

558
00:43:03,756 --> 00:43:05,994
He has told about it to everyone 
in this College since morning.

559
00:43:06,179 --> 00:43:07,655
He is the only person left out.

560
00:43:07,842 --> 00:43:10,201
Now he is explaining to him also.

561
00:43:11,142 --> 00:43:13,333
I jumped into the water, searched 
everywhere but could not find her.

562
00:43:13,413 --> 00:43:15,221
I stood on the Bank and saw...

563
00:43:16,623 --> 00:43:17,693
[clears throat]

564
00:43:17,932 --> 00:43:19,580
Sister! Do you want tea?

565
00:43:20,767 --> 00:43:21,837
He is caught.

566
00:43:22,732 --> 00:43:25,340
Have you finished today's homework?

567
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:27,455
I have not eaten anything since morning.

568
00:43:32,383 --> 00:43:35,089
He was asking me about the incident.

569
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:38,180
So I was telling our story...

570
00:44:05,275 --> 00:44:06,770
[pat]

571
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:11,370
"I saw your dark cloud like eyes"

572
00:44:11,552 --> 00:44:15,779
"But my thirst is still not quenched"

573
00:44:15,859 --> 00:44:19,114
"When you come in my dream"

574
00:44:19,389 --> 00:44:23,800
"I do not wish to open my eyes."

575
00:44:24,013 --> 00:44:28,132
"I stood still like 
a Sculpture because of you"

576
00:44:28,381 --> 00:44:32,633
"Will become a statue 
if you do not touch me"

577
00:44:32,713 --> 00:44:36,938
"Only you are there in my heart"

578
00:44:37,151 --> 00:44:41,296
"I am nobody without you."

579
00:44:45,469 --> 00:44:49,890
"I will live within 
you like the fish in water"

580
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:54,142
"You are like the moon"

581
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:58,572
"You stare at me when I look at you"

582
00:44:58,652 --> 00:45:03,188
"In that moment when you see me"

583
00:45:03,268 --> 00:45:07,502
"My heart beats for you."

584
00:45:07,582 --> 00:45:11,675
"I yearn for you"

585
00:45:11,951 --> 00:45:16,123
"You live inside me. 
I freeze in life"

586
00:45:16,203 --> 00:45:21,171
"It is not me but you!"

587
00:45:21,349 --> 00:45:25,543
"If I do not unite 
with you in real life,"

588
00:45:25,623 --> 00:45:29,828
"Even my shadow will not be mine."

589
00:45:30,038 --> 00:45:33,400
"I will give up my life"

590
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:38,072
"If I do not see you."

591
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:42,334
"I turned into a 
child because of you,"

592
00:45:42,414 --> 00:45:46,761
"And I will listen to 
you like a dancing doll."

593
00:45:46,841 --> 00:45:50,934
"I am unable to stand on the ground"

594
00:45:51,267 --> 00:45:55,439
"My earth rotates 
around you every day."

595
00:46:03,939 --> 00:46:08,289
"You blow like a gentle 
breeze when I look at you,"

596
00:46:08,478 --> 00:46:12,639
"And blossom like 
a flower with honey."

597
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:17,211
"My heart yearns to sing for you"

598
00:46:17,291 --> 00:46:21,396
"Will invite you 
to lean on my shoulder."

599
00:46:21,476 --> 00:46:26,752
"I will live for you"

600
00:46:26,832 --> 00:46:30,473
"The only boon which 
I ask is to see you."

601
00:46:30,553 --> 00:46:35,233
"I have no life without you."

602
00:46:35,444 --> 00:46:39,783
"My life is yours."

603
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:44,018
"Even if I lose my relatives,"

604
00:46:44,222 --> 00:46:48,428
"I will keep thinking about you."

605
00:46:48,508 --> 00:46:52,067
"I do not have the courage 
to die without uniting with you"

606
00:46:52,147 --> 00:46:56,634
"I want to marry you."

607
00:46:56,714 --> 00:47:01,031
"I became a Hero because of you"

608
00:47:01,111 --> 00:47:05,289
"I will come riding 
a chariot to kidnap you"

609
00:47:05,369 --> 00:47:09,805
"Lost my sleep because of you"

610
00:47:09,885 --> 00:47:13,592
"You are my queen."

611
00:47:13,947 --> 00:47:18,315
"You are my Lady"

612
00:47:18,395 --> 00:47:22,744
"I will ask for your 
hand from your father."

613
00:47:22,824 --> 00:47:27,072
"Will marry you and fall on your lap"

614
00:47:27,152 --> 00:47:31,213
"Will love you even after my death."

615
00:47:34,593 --> 00:47:36,687
Dry fish for sale!

616
00:47:37,811 --> 00:47:39,170
Dry fish for sale!

617
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:41,209
Hey! Come here.

618
00:47:42,541 --> 00:47:43,942
Coming.

619
00:47:44,624 --> 00:47:46,009
[footsteps running]

620
00:47:46,089 --> 00:47:47,209
What type of fish do you have?

621
00:47:47,514 --> 00:47:49,027
Which one do you want?

622
00:47:52,251 --> 00:47:56,257
I have dried Anchovies, milkfish etc.

623
00:47:56,868 --> 00:47:58,750
Which one do you want? Tell me.

624
00:47:59,034 --> 00:48:00,199
Give me dried milkfish.

625
00:48:02,541 --> 00:48:06,298
Weather is extremely hot. I am thirsty.

626
00:48:06,378 --> 00:48:07,897
Can you get me some water to drink?

627
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:09,140
Poorni!

628
00:48:09,623 --> 00:48:11,178
Bring some water to drink.

629
00:48:19,355 --> 00:48:22,451
Put some more. Why are you so mean?

630
00:48:23,311 --> 00:48:28,084
If I put extra for every buyer, 
my business will end up in loss.

631
00:48:32,424 --> 00:48:33,470
Take.

632
00:48:34,093 --> 00:48:36,850
[chink]

633
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,080
Who is she? Your daughter?

634
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,608
-Yes. She is my daughter. 
-What is she doing?

635
00:48:41,850 --> 00:48:43,128
Studying in College.

636
00:48:44,038 --> 00:48:45,665
Wait. I will bring money.

637
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:52,760
In which College are you studying?

638
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:54,337
Ennaji Rajappa College.

639
00:48:54,926 --> 00:48:57,469
My son is also studying there. 
His name is Marudu.

640
00:48:57,549 --> 00:48:59,841
-Do you know him? 
-Is he your son?!

641
00:48:59,921 --> 00:49:01,637
Yes. Do you know him?

642
00:49:04,599 --> 00:49:07,731
Does he attend college properly? 
Does he study well?

643
00:49:07,944 --> 00:49:13,533
Or Is he creating problems 
there just as he is doing here?

644
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:16,772
No. Marudu is a very good boy.

645
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:19,813
He studies well. Do not worry.

646
00:49:22,946 --> 00:49:25,794
As per his father's wish, 
I want to give him good education.

647
00:49:26,176 --> 00:49:29,329
So I am selling dry fish 
and leading a frugal life.

648
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:35,950
I feel happy when I 
hear good things about him.

649
00:49:41,482 --> 00:49:42,519
Take money.

650
00:49:50,327 --> 00:49:51,442
See you.

651
00:49:54,567 --> 00:49:56,470
Dry fish for sale!

652
00:49:58,907 --> 00:50:00,746
Dry fish for sale!

653
00:50:03,855 --> 00:50:07,069
"You stood with me"

654
00:50:07,149 --> 00:50:09,271
He has done something for 
which he was called for enquiry.

655
00:50:09,484 --> 00:50:11,571
Now what is he doing inside?

656
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:12,841
Marudu!

657
00:50:16,562 --> 00:50:21,023
"You are the essence of my life"

658
00:50:21,103 --> 00:50:22,273
Has he slept?

659
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:26,107
-"I will die without you." 
-Radio is still playing.

660
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:29,756
Hey! Did you eat?

661
00:50:29,915 --> 00:50:31,824
I have eaten. You eat and sleep.

662
00:50:31,904 --> 00:50:33,360
I wonder what he ate!

663
00:50:34,283 --> 00:50:37,373
I have brought some sweet for you. 
Eat it and then sleep.

664
00:50:37,453 --> 00:50:38,802
[puff]

665
00:50:38,947 --> 00:50:41,282
I will eat in the morning. 
Do not nag me.

666
00:50:41,362 --> 00:50:44,132
I bought because you like it. 
Never mind.

667
00:50:48,057 --> 00:50:51,113
I went to sell dry 
fish in the next village.

668
00:50:51,308 --> 00:50:53,643
I saw a girl there who 
said she studies with you.

669
00:50:53,821 --> 00:50:58,807
Her name sounded something 
like 'Parni' or Poorni'.

670
00:51:00,211 --> 00:51:03,803
I was shouting at you 
before but you did not get up.

671
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:06,689
Now that I mentioned a girl's name, 
you are right in front of me!

672
00:51:06,835 --> 00:51:08,149
I did not come for that reason.

673
00:51:08,514 --> 00:51:10,711
I came for the sweet 
which you bought for me. Give.

674
00:51:12,795 --> 00:51:14,870
Take.

675
00:51:18,438 --> 00:51:20,481
What did she say?

676
00:51:20,854 --> 00:51:24,357
I have understood your intention.

677
00:51:24,437 --> 00:51:26,562
I have no such feelings.

678
00:51:27,008 --> 00:51:28,365
It is only because 
you should not believe it

679
00:51:28,445 --> 00:51:29,652
if someone complains about your son.

680
00:51:29,732 --> 00:51:30,957
That is why I asked.

681
00:51:31,103 --> 00:51:32,984
I would have believed if she 
had told spoken wrongly about you.

682
00:51:33,064 --> 00:51:34,176
[tongue twisting]

683
00:51:34,557 --> 00:51:36,957
Why are you staring at me? 
That is the truth.

684
00:51:37,104 --> 00:51:38,896
Rascal!

685
00:51:39,253 --> 00:51:45,198
I could not believe when she said 
that you are a good boy and study well.

686
00:51:45,405 --> 00:51:46,582
You may go.

687
00:51:50,208 --> 00:51:53,353
"You stood along with me"

688
00:51:53,433 --> 00:51:56,653
"And our hearts unite."

689
00:52:08,279 --> 00:52:09,301
Poorni!

690
00:52:09,447 --> 00:52:10,501
Marudu.

691
00:52:11,157 --> 00:52:12,536
What are you doing here?

692
00:52:12,909 --> 00:52:14,555
Are you waiting for someone?

693
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:16,638
Waiting for you.

694
00:52:16,718 --> 00:52:18,065
-For me?! 
-Yes.

695
00:52:18,145 --> 00:52:19,289
Why?

696
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:24,721
College people are gossiping that we 
love each other after seeing us together.

697
00:52:24,941 --> 00:52:26,108
But you do not worry.

698
00:52:27,017 --> 00:52:31,257
You should not mistake me 
when you come to know about it.

699
00:52:31,337 --> 00:52:32,895
That is why I came to tell you.

700
00:52:32,975 --> 00:52:36,495
Both of us have no such feelings. 
Let people gossip.

701
00:52:36,575 --> 00:52:39,551
I will neither feel 
about it nor mistake it.

702
00:52:39,972 --> 00:52:41,262
Hope you did not mistake me.

703
00:52:41,342 --> 00:52:43,070
No. I have not mistaken you.

704
00:52:43,929 --> 00:52:46,021
Really you did not mistake me?

705
00:52:46,272 --> 00:52:47,781
Really I did not mistake it.

706
00:52:49,012 --> 00:52:50,302
Then...

707
00:52:53,691 --> 00:52:55,224
I love you.

708
00:52:56,545 --> 00:52:58,978
I started loving you the day I saw you.

709
00:52:59,058 --> 00:53:01,791
I did not tell it then because 
I did not want you to reject me.

710
00:53:01,954 --> 00:53:04,167
I waited till you start liking me.

711
00:53:08,481 --> 00:53:11,011
What happened? Why are you crying?

712
00:53:11,635 --> 00:53:14,497
I told my feelings. 
Forget it if you do not like it.

713
00:53:29,566 --> 00:53:32,745
You came... 
Spoke... And now you are going away.

714
00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:34,666
Drop me in the bus.

715
00:53:35,841 --> 00:53:37,163
Did you hold my hand for this reason?

716
00:53:48,366 --> 00:53:51,077
Tell the truth. Do you like me?

717
00:53:52,141 --> 00:53:53,931
Yes. I like you.

718
00:53:54,366 --> 00:53:56,280
I like to speak and mingle with you.

719
00:53:56,877 --> 00:53:59,569
But let us not fall in love.

720
00:53:59,649 --> 00:54:00,957
[bus honking]

721
00:54:11,106 --> 00:54:13,265
[clatter]

722
00:54:14,938 --> 00:54:20,321
Many young boys here have chosen 
their life partner and are married.

723
00:54:20,401 --> 00:54:22,900
I want you to get married.

724
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:25,721
But I think it will 
not happen when I am alive.

725
00:54:26,078 --> 00:54:27,197
Stop nagging me.

726
00:54:27,626 --> 00:54:30,699
Whatever I speak is nagging for you.

727
00:54:31,024 --> 00:54:35,516
Only a Mother will know 
the gossip going around here.

728
00:54:36,935 --> 00:54:38,216
You want me to get married. Right?

729
00:54:38,296 --> 00:54:39,521
Search a girl for me. I will marry her.

730
00:54:39,601 --> 00:54:42,732
As if people stand in queue 
to give their daughter to you!

731
00:54:43,299 --> 00:54:49,248
Nobody is willing to give 
their daughter to you for marriage.

732
00:54:49,648 --> 00:54:51,407
They are right.

733
00:54:51,554 --> 00:54:53,176
You are not a good man.

734
00:54:53,549 --> 00:54:56,784
You associate with your Uncle 
and are involved in thrashing people.

735
00:54:56,954 --> 00:54:59,240
Who will give his daughter to you?

736
00:55:00,514 --> 00:55:03,887
Your mother has no sense. 
You also don't have?

737
00:55:05,136 --> 00:55:07,868
Will anyone search for a girl outside when 
there is a suitable match in relation?

738
00:55:07,948 --> 00:55:11,360
-What are you saying? 
-Marry your uncle's daughter Poorni.

739
00:55:12,774 --> 00:55:13,876
It is disgusting.

740
00:55:14,375 --> 00:55:16,140
I brought her up since she was a child.

741
00:55:16,542 --> 00:55:17,601
How can I marry her?

742
00:55:17,787 --> 00:55:18,862
[spit]

743
00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:22,289
He is not telling some unusual thing.

744
00:55:22,634 --> 00:55:24,697
A girl is brought 
up to get married to her.

745
00:55:24,885 --> 00:55:25,975
Why don't you understand?

746
00:55:26,345 --> 00:55:28,323
Buddy! Who is Poorni?

747
00:55:29,231 --> 00:55:30,418
She is your uncle's daughter.

748
00:55:30,956 --> 00:55:32,785
You have helped your uncle a lot.

749
00:55:33,285 --> 00:55:34,854
Will he not give his 
daughter in marriage to you?

750
00:55:35,107 --> 00:55:36,580
Go and ask.[lighting]

751
00:55:41,919 --> 00:55:43,794
You can wait for certain things.

752
00:55:43,874 --> 00:55:45,110
But this matter is not like that.

753
00:55:45,441 --> 00:55:47,497
Take care. Come.

754
00:56:18,815 --> 00:56:22,298
As if people stand in queue 
to give their daughter to you!

755
00:56:22,441 --> 00:56:28,408
Nobody is willing to give 
their daughter to you for marriage.

756
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:36,424

[door opens]

759
00:57:06,739 --> 00:57:08,721
What is the matter? 
Why have you come at this hour?

760
00:57:09,657 --> 00:57:11,559
I want to speak to you.

761
00:57:11,639 --> 00:57:12,770
Come in. We can speak.

762
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:16,348
No. Let us speak and then go inside.

763
00:57:16,586 --> 00:57:17,885
Okay. What is the matter? Tell me.

764
00:57:19,779 --> 00:57:22,496
You often call me 'son-in-law'.

765
00:57:23,107 --> 00:57:24,660
Didn't you think of getting me married?

766
00:57:25,177 --> 00:57:26,199
That's all?

767
00:57:26,788 --> 00:57:28,446
-I will find a girl for you immediately. 
-Why?

768
00:57:28,629 --> 00:57:30,040
Will you not get your daughter 
married to me?

769
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:32,175
Your tone is changing.

770
00:57:32,255 --> 00:57:35,329
Nobody is ready to get his daughter

771
00:57:36,509 --> 00:57:37,912
married to me.

772
00:57:37,992 --> 00:57:39,116
Because I am a rogue.

773
00:57:39,996 --> 00:57:42,472
They say that I fight with everyone.

774
00:57:43,018 --> 00:57:45,526
Of course I beat them.

775
00:57:46,069 --> 00:57:47,407
But I do it for your sake.

776
00:57:48,409 --> 00:57:50,292
So it is not wrong 
to I marry your daughter.

777
00:57:51,226 --> 00:57:53,647
Why are you speaking like this?

778
00:57:53,727 --> 00:57:55,958
You are drunk. 
Go home and come tomorrow.

779
00:57:56,304 --> 00:57:59,275
Am I drunk? Am I a drunkard?

780
00:57:59,956 --> 00:58:01,246
This is my final question.

781
00:58:01,326 --> 00:58:02,992
Will you get your daughter 
married to me or not?

782
00:58:03,538 --> 00:58:04,816
If I refuse...

783
00:58:05,736 --> 00:58:06,785
I will kidnap her.

784
00:58:06,865 --> 00:58:08,252
-What did you say? 
-Stop!

785
00:58:08,898 --> 00:58:09,900
Take off your hand.

786
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:11,053
[sighs]

787
00:58:11,538 --> 00:58:15,041
I would have given you my property

788
00:58:15,121 --> 00:58:16,826
if you had asked for it.

789
00:58:18,234 --> 00:58:21,973
But my daughter is my life.

790
00:58:23,135 --> 00:58:24,538
Are you telling me

791
00:58:24,853 --> 00:58:27,424
that you will kidnap my daughter?

792
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:28,523
You...

793
00:58:29,691 --> 00:58:31,616
-No! Listen to me. 
-Father, stop...

794
00:58:31,696 --> 00:58:32,750
-Listen to me. 
-Father...

795
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:33,884
-Leave me. 
-All are watching us.

796
00:58:33,964 --> 00:58:37,226
Come inside...

797
00:58:37,306 --> 00:58:40,135
Get out. Come on, get out.

798
00:58:40,361 --> 00:58:41,371
Come in.

799
00:58:41,451 --> 00:58:44,999
You and your uncle were 
dominating everyone in this place.

800
00:58:46,274 --> 00:58:47,955
I expected this to happen.

801
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,129
[anklets clinking]

802
00:59:00,514 --> 00:59:01,753
Why did you call me here?

803
00:59:01,833 --> 00:59:04,549
Poorni, you said that you like 
to speak and mingle with me

804
00:59:04,629 --> 00:59:06,671
but will not love me.

805
00:59:07,143 --> 00:59:09,372
I was thinking about it 
and did not get sleep at night.

806
00:59:09,701 --> 00:59:12,357
[tongue twisting]  
Why are you not in love with me?

807
00:59:12,626 --> 00:59:13,760
Am I not handsome?

808
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:15,524
Have you gone mad?

809
00:59:15,824 --> 00:59:17,480
Does love happen because of beauty?

810
00:59:17,921 --> 00:59:18,989
Listen!

811
00:59:19,476 --> 00:59:22,309
Forget about love and study properly.

812
00:59:23,306 --> 00:59:24,953
Did you think of your mother?

813
00:59:25,807 --> 00:59:27,451
She is suffering so much 
by going to different places

814
00:59:27,531 --> 00:59:29,002
to sell dry fish.

815
00:59:30,002 --> 00:59:31,931
Am I more important to you than her?

816
00:59:32,908 --> 00:59:36,444
Does it mean that a boy from 
poor family should not fall in love?

817
00:59:36,524 --> 00:59:39,128
I did not mean that. 
I do not want to fall in love.

818
00:59:39,718 --> 00:59:40,823
Understand?

819
00:59:41,085 --> 00:59:42,165
Why?

820
00:59:42,395 --> 00:59:43,867
Because my father will never agree.

821
00:59:44,102 --> 00:59:45,567
He doesn't like such things.

822
00:59:46,006 --> 00:59:47,010
It is foolish to love someone

823
00:59:47,090 --> 00:59:49,509
when I know that my love 
will never be accepted by him.

824
00:59:50,076 --> 00:59:51,164
I do not wish to do that.

825
00:59:51,407 --> 00:59:54,949
I love you. Not your father.

826
00:59:55,084 --> 00:59:56,575
[chuckles]  
Can I leave you

827
00:59:56,655 --> 00:59:57,782
because he doesn't like it?

828
00:59:58,025 --> 00:59:59,306
I cannot reform you.

829
01:00:00,966 --> 01:00:02,040
Poorni!

830
01:00:03,090 --> 01:00:04,169
Like me

831
01:00:04,826 --> 01:00:07,633
you are beautiful 
even when you are angry.

832
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:21,626
[pouring]

833
01:00:24,683 --> 01:00:26,203
-Poorni! 
-What?

834
01:00:26,283 --> 01:00:28,831
He said you were talking to a boy, 
standing on the bridge.

835
01:00:28,911 --> 01:00:29,949
Who is he?

836
01:00:30,029 --> 01:00:31,143
He is my classmate.

837
01:00:31,223 --> 01:00:32,293
Classmate?

838
01:00:32,373 --> 01:00:33,688
You can speak to him in college.

839
01:00:33,768 --> 01:00:35,290
Why should you speak to him 
outside the premises?

840
01:00:35,370 --> 01:00:37,273
Don't do this again. Understand?

841
01:00:38,036 --> 01:00:39,075
Okay.

842
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:43,063
Our daughter has no such feelings.

843
01:00:43,716 --> 01:00:45,624
But if that boy has...

844
01:00:50,506 --> 01:00:51,539
[vehicle receding]

845
01:00:53,501 --> 01:00:55,468
[footfalls]

846
01:00:58,350 --> 01:01:00,003
-Give one cup of tea. 
-Okay.

847
01:01:04,814 --> 01:01:07,495
Has the girls returned 
from the Computer class?

848
01:01:08,381 --> 01:01:09,509
Will I do my business

849
01:01:09,589 --> 01:01:11,835
or look for the girls 
coming from Computer class?

850
01:01:11,915 --> 01:01:13,688
I feel you may change my job.

851
01:01:13,768 --> 01:01:15,438
Not enough 
if you just work in your shop.

852
01:01:15,518 --> 01:01:17,633
You should know 
what is happening around you.

853
01:01:17,713 --> 01:01:19,030
Only then you can answer 
to boys like me

854
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:20,893
and your business will also pick up.

855
01:01:21,652 --> 01:01:23,684
I am not interested in such things.

856
01:01:28,169 --> 01:01:29,311
Which is your native place?

857
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:32,637
-Are you asking me? 
-Yes.

858
01:01:32,717 --> 01:01:34,608
Kilamangalam. Why are you asking?

859
01:01:34,688 --> 01:01:36,166
A boy from your village

860
01:01:36,246 --> 01:01:38,370
is creating problem 
to a girl from our place.

861
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:39,937
We have come to see that person.

862
01:01:40,372 --> 01:01:42,122
Who? Which place?

863
01:01:42,202 --> 01:01:44,940
In Solangarai. 
Maniyar's daughter Poorni.

864
01:01:55,393 --> 01:01:58,510
You are asking the right person.

865
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:00,026
Why don't you ask directly?

866
01:02:00,106 --> 01:02:01,833
Why are you beating around the bush?

867
01:02:01,913 --> 01:02:03,021
You have understood rightly.

868
01:02:03,101 --> 01:02:05,105
If we again see you 
roaming with that girl

869
01:02:05,185 --> 01:02:07,044
we will break your limbs. 
Be careful.

870
01:02:07,124 --> 01:02:08,530
What right do you have to say that?

871
01:02:08,610 --> 01:02:11,544
I love that girl. She also loves me.

872
01:02:11,624 --> 01:02:12,981
I cannot leave her.

873
01:02:13,061 --> 01:02:17,744
That girl doesn't love you. 
Concentrate on your studies.

874
01:02:18,424 --> 01:02:21,197
Did she tell you 
that she doesn't love me?

875
01:02:21,277 --> 01:02:22,305
She didn't say. Right?

876
01:02:22,809 --> 01:02:24,708
You may go now.

877
01:02:31,751 --> 01:02:33,953
Are you being sarcastic? 
Will you not listen to us?

878
01:02:34,033 --> 01:02:35,710
I love that girl.

879
01:02:35,992 --> 01:02:37,400
Please go from here.

882
01:02:52,249 --> 01:02:53,296
Poorni!

883
01:02:53,376 --> 01:02:55,203
-Poorni... 
-See there!

[coughs] 
[beating]

885
01:03:00,665 --> 01:03:01,994
Marudu!

886
01:03:02,074 --> 01:03:03,779
-Please do not harm him. 
-You go from here.

887
01:03:03,859 --> 01:03:05,293
-You go home. 
-Tell them.

888
01:03:05,373 --> 01:03:07,383
-Poorni! Tell them. 
-Let him go.

889
01:03:07,463 --> 01:03:08,608
Poorni! Tell them.

890
01:03:08,688 --> 01:03:11,197
-Poorni! Say that you love me. 
-Go home. I said, 'Go home.'

891
01:03:11,277 --> 01:03:13,757
Are you crazy? 
Can't you understand things?

892
01:03:13,837 --> 01:03:14,982
Can't you understand?

893
01:03:15,062 --> 01:03:16,906
-Brother... 
-I said, 'Go home'.

894
01:03:16,986 --> 01:03:19,398
-Go. Take her home. 
-Brother, please do not beat him.

895
01:03:19,478 --> 01:03:20,921
-Let us go away from here. 
-Brother...

896
01:03:21,001 --> 01:03:23,234
-Come. 
-Please don't beat him.

897
01:03:23,314 --> 01:03:25,232
[groaning] 
[crying]

898
01:03:26,345 --> 01:03:28,101
Come. Let us go away from here.

899
01:03:28,181 --> 01:03:29,584
Car!

900
01:03:29,664 --> 01:03:33,059
Poorni! Tell them that you love me.

901
01:03:33,951 --> 01:03:35,474
-Spare him. 
-Come on.

902
01:03:35,643 --> 01:03:36,661
Brother...

903
01:03:36,831 --> 01:03:37,920
No...

904
01:03:39,572 --> 01:03:41,069
Let us go away from here.

905
01:03:41,273 --> 01:03:42,576
Poorni!

906
01:03:42,813 --> 01:03:45,175
Hey, Poorni. Come. Let us go.

907
01:03:45,666 --> 01:03:48,306
-Poorni! Come. Let us go. 
-Leave me. Marudu...

908
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:51,656
[crying]

909
01:03:51,770 --> 01:03:53,414
Poorni!

910
01:03:55,467 --> 01:03:56,600
Poorni!

911
01:03:57,052 --> 01:03:59,051
-Tell them that you love me. 
-Come. Let us go.

912
01:03:59,131 --> 01:04:00,581
-You understand... 
-He doesn't understand.

913
01:04:00,661 --> 01:04:01,796
-Please, understand... 
-You love me. Right?

914
01:04:01,876 --> 01:04:03,729
-Do you love me? Tell, Poorni. 
-Come.

915
01:04:03,809 --> 01:04:05,256
-Marudu! 
-Do you love me?

916
01:04:05,336 --> 01:04:07,808
-Do you love me? 
-Yes, I love you.

917
01:04:07,950 --> 01:04:09,073
Are you satisfied now?

918
01:05:45,997 --> 01:05:47,831
Brother! What happened?

919
01:05:47,911 --> 01:05:49,392
Who beat you like this? Tell.

920
01:05:49,974 --> 01:05:54,374
Poorni said that she loves me.

921
01:05:54,454 --> 01:05:56,931
He is hurt badly.

922
01:05:57,011 --> 01:05:58,989
Come. Let us go to hospital. Come.

923
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:01,949
Lift him.

924
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:04,302
Wait.[footfalls]

925
01:06:04,664 --> 01:06:09,214
Poorni said that she loves me.

926
01:06:09,294 --> 01:06:10,525
I am stupid.

927
01:06:11,439 --> 01:06:14,161
-I told him in haste. 
-Listen. Do not cry.

928
01:06:22,391 --> 01:06:23,477
[vehicle approaching]

929
01:06:28,037 --> 01:06:29,064
What is your name?

930
01:06:29,585 --> 01:06:30,591
Mari.

931
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:33,015
-Yours? 
-Murugesan.

932
01:06:33,095 --> 01:06:35,050
Who are you? 
Why are you enquiring about us?

933
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:37,379
-Who is Marudu? 
-Why are you asking?

934
01:06:38,586 --> 01:06:39,695
[groaning]

935
01:06:39,775 --> 01:06:40,923
Sir!

936
01:06:41,003 --> 01:06:42,551
-Marudu is a common name here. 
-Yes.

937
01:06:42,631 --> 01:06:44,543
We do not want to tell you 
the wrong person.

938
01:06:44,623 --> 01:06:45,930
That is why...

939
01:06:46,278 --> 01:06:48,337
A boy named Marudu 
is after a girl named Poorni

940
01:06:48,417 --> 01:06:50,382
who comes from Solangarai 
to attend college here.

941
01:06:50,462 --> 01:06:52,175
I want to meet him.[laughs]

942
01:06:52,255 --> 01:06:55,023
He is referring to Sister Poorni.

943
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,305
Even we study in the same college.

944
01:06:57,385 --> 01:06:58,874
Sir! Who are you?

945
01:06:59,170 --> 01:07:00,403
Poorni's uncle.

946
01:07:02,593 --> 01:07:03,671
[cow mooing] 
[footfalls]

947
01:07:03,751 --> 01:07:04,760
Sir!

948
01:07:05,079 --> 01:07:06,842
Your brother-in-law is beating a boy

949
01:07:06,922 --> 01:07:09,411
who was troubling 
your daughter in college.

950
01:07:09,491 --> 01:07:11,027
I came to inform that.

951
01:07:11,107 --> 01:07:12,107
Okay. You may go.

952
01:07:18,092 --> 01:07:19,493
Go and tell your brother

953
01:07:19,818 --> 01:07:21,296
not to turn the matter 
into a serious one.

954
01:07:21,376 --> 01:07:23,517
He doesn't listen to me.

955
01:07:23,597 --> 01:07:25,660
Either you should tell him 
or our daughter...

956
01:07:26,811 --> 01:07:28,092
What shall I say?

957
01:07:28,318 --> 01:07:30,053
My words have no value here.

958
01:07:30,133 --> 01:07:31,316
-Poorni! 
-Yes, father.

959
01:07:33,804 --> 01:07:36,884
Tell your uncle to release that boy.

960
01:07:36,964 --> 01:07:38,183
[hen clucking]  
Okay, father.

961
01:07:46,513 --> 01:07:48,126
-Go with her. 
-Okay.

962
01:07:52,953 --> 01:07:54,214
Why are you staring at me?

963
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:56,625
You do not understand your brother.

964
01:07:57,030 --> 01:07:58,865
But I understand him fully.

965
01:07:58,945 --> 01:08:00,275
He is a very good person.

966
01:08:01,179 --> 01:08:03,977
He might have spoken wrongly on that day 
because he was drunk.

967
01:08:04,057 --> 01:08:05,522
But his mind is pure.

968
01:08:07,649 --> 01:08:11,613
You thrashed me 
and asked about a girl named Poorni.

969
01:08:12,309 --> 01:08:14,821
But I have never seen such a girl.

970
01:08:15,163 --> 01:08:18,254
Oh, God! Oh, God!

971
01:08:18,432 --> 01:08:19,963
Useless fellow!

972
01:08:20,144 --> 01:08:22,595
You are ugly looking. 
Were you after my granddaughter?

973
01:08:24,016 --> 01:08:26,201
I will break you limbs.

974
01:08:26,281 --> 01:08:28,432
I am going to be thrashed 
by this old lady also.

975
01:08:28,798 --> 01:08:29,891
Alas!

976
01:08:30,091 --> 01:08:31,832
-Oh, mother... 
-Hey!

977
01:08:32,356 --> 01:08:33,363
What is it?

978
01:08:33,443 --> 01:08:35,822
You ogle even at my grandmother.

979
01:08:35,902 --> 01:08:37,517
I can imagine how you 
would have gazed at my sister!

980
01:08:38,413 --> 01:08:39,859
I will teach you a lesson.

981
01:08:40,623 --> 01:08:43,989
Oh no... No, no...

982
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:51,261
Even a small boy 
from this village is beating me.

983
01:08:52,443 --> 01:08:53,724
Oh, God!

984
01:08:56,497 --> 01:08:57,926
He is eating so fast

985
01:08:58,006 --> 01:09:00,247
that I think he will beat me again 
after gaining strength!

986
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:03,277
Alas!

987
01:09:04,633 --> 01:09:07,080
Oh, God! Oh, God!

988
01:09:07,674 --> 01:09:08,710
Oh, no...

989
01:09:09,881 --> 01:09:10,961
What is the matter?

990
01:09:11,713 --> 01:09:12,726
Why have you come?

991
01:09:12,806 --> 01:09:15,304
Do not beat him. Please release him.

992
01:09:15,589 --> 01:09:17,282
He is already hurt.

993
01:09:17,454 --> 01:09:19,063
You also do not beat him.

994
01:09:19,281 --> 01:09:23,080
See there! He is hanging 
like a crow from electric pole.

995
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:25,102
Who is he? Where is Marudu?

996
01:09:26,211 --> 01:09:28,978
What are you saying? 
Is he not the person who was after you?

997
01:09:29,058 --> 01:09:30,692
I do not know him at all.

998
01:09:30,772 --> 01:09:31,853
I see.

999
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:36,479
Hey! Bring him.

1000
01:09:39,336 --> 01:09:40,622
Oh, God!

1001
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:44,068
I wonder in which tree he 
is going to tie me up and beat!

1002
01:09:44,292 --> 01:09:45,750
Oh, God!

1003
01:09:46,172 --> 01:09:47,187
What is your name?

1004
01:09:49,285 --> 01:09:51,875
Did you thrash me 
all the while to ask this?

1005
01:09:54,330 --> 01:09:55,461
Ayanar.

1006
01:09:58,490 --> 01:10:00,127
I mistook you for Marudu and beat you.

1007
01:10:00,207 --> 01:10:01,214
You may go.

1008
01:10:07,095 --> 01:10:08,410
Oh, mother...

1009
01:10:09,896 --> 01:10:11,130
Sir! Be careful.

1010
01:10:11,534 --> 01:10:13,617
-Who are you? 
-I am Poorni.

1011
01:10:16,418 --> 01:10:18,564
Is she that girl?

1012
01:10:18,644 --> 01:10:21,921
Oh, mother! 
Wish she could have come bit earlier.

1013
01:10:22,001 --> 01:10:23,697
Stop this matter here.

1014
01:10:24,222 --> 01:10:28,011
I feel bad that others 
are affected because of me.

1015
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:32,113
Including you...

1016
01:10:33,764 --> 01:10:35,023
See you, uncle.

1017
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:36,776
Let us go.

1018
01:10:44,266 --> 01:10:49,382
Instead of attending 
the college peacefully

1019
01:10:50,170 --> 01:10:54,113
he is always involved in some fight.

1020
01:10:54,617 --> 01:10:56,657
My husband is dead.

1021
01:10:56,737 --> 01:10:58,586
I should have also died with him.

1022
01:10:58,666 --> 01:11:00,502
Then I need not worry about such things.

1023
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:04,317
He doesn't listen to me at all.

1024
01:11:04,397 --> 01:11:08,554
How can I bear it if he 
something untoward had happened?

1025
01:11:11,613 --> 01:11:13,540
Why are you crying now?

1026
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:17,254
Nowadays boys chase girls.

1027
01:11:17,334 --> 01:11:18,654
But Marudu is not like that.

1028
01:11:18,734 --> 01:11:22,018
It is usual thing to 
indulge in fight in College.

1029
01:11:22,098 --> 01:11:24,573
But how can I allow 
him to continue like this?

1030
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:26,969
When is he going to reform?

1031
01:11:27,230 --> 01:11:29,089
Pray Goddess Kali to show a path.

1032
01:11:29,169 --> 01:11:31,871
Hey! Are you in romance mood?

1033
01:11:31,951 --> 01:11:34,082
Why are you looking 
at the ceiling and smiling?

1034
01:11:34,634 --> 01:11:36,693
Are you not able to 
hear your mother's cry?

1035
01:11:37,373 --> 01:11:40,951
If your mother knows the real fact, 
she will make a big fuss over it.

1036
01:11:41,031 --> 01:11:42,232
Keep quiet.

1037
01:11:42,312 --> 01:11:45,346
Brother, Poorni said that she loves me.

1038
01:11:45,426 --> 01:11:47,184
-Is it? 
-Yes.

1039
01:11:47,821 --> 01:11:49,501
We sacrificed a person 
for the sake of his love.

1040
01:11:49,581 --> 01:11:51,115
Now we do not know his whereabouts.

1041
01:11:51,650 --> 01:11:52,799
But look at him.

1042
01:11:53,097 --> 01:11:55,861
He is not worried about anything 
and is still in his romantic mood.

1043
01:11:56,748 --> 01:11:59,694
Brother, did they really beat you?

1044
01:12:00,266 --> 01:12:01,706
They threw me in the 
air and stamped on me.

1045
01:12:01,990 --> 01:12:03,237
-Is it? 
-Yes.

1046
01:12:08,990 --> 01:12:10,608
[birds chirping]

1047
01:12:28,311 --> 01:12:29,847
I was beaten because of you.

1048
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:31,785
And now are you playing music 
and enjoying it?

1049
01:12:32,243 --> 01:12:34,182
Go...

1050
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:37,243
Oh, God! Oh, mother...

1051
01:12:37,709 --> 01:12:39,109
Oh, God!

1052
01:12:39,697 --> 01:12:40,834
Oh, mother...

1053
01:12:57,189 --> 01:12:58,190
[whistles]

1054
01:13:10,849 --> 01:13:12,245
Poorni!

1055
01:13:20,598 --> 01:13:21,646
Poorni!

1056
01:13:38,616 --> 01:13:40,576
Reached college. All of you get down.

[vehicle halts]

1058
01:13:50,087 --> 01:13:51,109

1060
01:14:02,181 --> 01:14:03,324

[footfalls]

1062
01:14:12,184 --> 01:14:13,204
Poorni!

1063
01:14:13,728 --> 01:14:14,826
Poorni!

1064
01:14:16,928 --> 01:14:18,581
Is this a college or some other place?

1065
01:14:23,641 --> 01:14:24,935
Sir! Am I looking handsome?

1066
01:14:26,755 --> 01:14:27,830
Of course, this is a college.

1067
01:14:29,294 --> 01:14:30,323
[sighs]

1068
01:14:35,097 --> 01:14:38,735
You are neither eating 
food nor coming out of the room.

1069
01:14:38,815 --> 01:14:40,452
What is the matter?

1070
01:14:40,646 --> 01:14:42,177
Your behavior is not alright.

1071
01:14:42,338 --> 01:14:45,424
Let your father come back. 
Then you will be fine.

1072
01:14:54,147 --> 01:14:55,279
I don't want. You may go.

1073
01:14:57,397 --> 01:14:58,863
I said, I don't want.

1074
01:15:00,303 --> 01:15:02,387
Listen to me. 
I don't want to eat. You go.

1075
01:15:06,981 --> 01:15:10,803
I said I love him because 
I did not want him to get beaten.

1076
01:15:11,726 --> 01:15:16,031
But he has taken it to heart 
and is after me.

1077
01:15:17,105 --> 01:15:20,248
I also ignore him.

1078
01:15:22,112 --> 01:15:25,715
But I fear he may harm himself 
because of that.

1079
01:16:35,187 --> 01:16:38,451
Yes, I love him.

1080
01:16:40,202 --> 01:16:41,453

1082
01:17:48,263 --> 01:17:49,308
Marudu!

1083
01:17:49,869 --> 01:17:51,694
Are you going to say

1084
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:53,872
'They were thrashing you so much.'

1085
01:17:53,984 --> 01:17:58,465
If you ask whether I love 
you at that time, what can I do?

1086
01:17:58,545 --> 01:18:02,011
That is why I said that I love you.'

1087
01:18:02,539 --> 01:18:04,260
No, Marudu!

1088
01:18:04,883 --> 01:18:07,500
Then are you going to say, 'Your mother 
is educating you with great difficulty.'

1089
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:09,193
Am I more important to you than her?

1090
01:18:10,083 --> 01:18:11,189
No.

1091
01:18:13,232 --> 01:18:14,643
I do not know whether you 
said it because you liked me or not.

1092
01:18:14,723 --> 01:18:16,741
But you said it. 
It is still in my heart.

1093
01:18:17,037 --> 01:18:18,196
Let it remain so.

1094
01:18:18,642 --> 01:18:22,227
Don't advice me to study 
or take care of my mother.

1095
01:18:22,458 --> 01:18:23,491
I can handle it.

1096
01:18:23,927 --> 01:18:24,971
Marudu!

1097
01:18:26,267 --> 01:18:28,389
I will not come after you from now. 
Are you happy?

1098
01:18:39,208 --> 01:18:40,471
Like me

1099
01:18:41,167 --> 01:18:44,507
you also look beautiful 
when you are angry.

1100
01:18:58,957 --> 01:19:00,023

01:19:29,426 --> 01:19:32,529
"whether this feeling is real"

1106
01:19:32,609 --> 01:19:35,623
"My heart is taunting at me"

01:19:35,703 --> 01:19:38,306
"My face looks new to me"

1108
01:19:38,386 --> 01:19:43,850
"I do not feel like speaking"

1109
01:19:43,930 --> 01:19:49,113
"I am trying to laugh"

1110
01:19:49,193 --> 01:19:54,378
"without being seen by anyone."

"The earth is not new to sky"

1112
01:20:00,047 --> 01:20:05,525
"How can earth survive 
without being touched by rain?"

1113
01:20:05,605 --> 01:20:11,247
"There is some glitch in my feeling"

1114
01:20:11,327 --> 01:20:17,235
"I have to cross over it."

1115
01:20:17,315 --> 01:20:22,733
"Our eyes speak when they meet"

1116
01:20:22,813 --> 01:20:28,625
"Our mouth speaks in other times."

"Flower blossoms on the place 
touched by feet"

"even when eyes are closed."

Marudu.

01:21:56,027 --> 01:22:01,472
"Why are you feeling shy?"

01:22:01,552 --> 01:22:06,906
"Can we live forever?"

"I can never forget it 
in my lifetime"

all this time"

"Imagine how Earth will look 
without any living being"

1129
01:22:35,234 --> 01:22:41,150
"Tell the reason for which 
living beings were created."

we are the perfect couple"

Do not worry. We will take care.

It is getting late. 
Let us perform the rituals.

-Buddy! 
-Yes.

1151
01:24:19,688 --> 01:24:20,688
Hold this.

Why are you sitting here?

-Mother! 
-Nothing...

1157

-Why are you crying? 
-Not feeling good.

1158
01:24:35,122 --> 01:24:38,568
Oh! Are you reminded of your husband?

1159
01:24:39,590 --> 01:24:43,975
Your father came in my dream yesterday.

1160
01:24:44,055 --> 01:24:47,439
It is a happy thing. 
Why are you crying for that?

1161
01:24:47,681 --> 01:24:50,717
Okay. Did he ask about me?

1162
01:24:50,797 --> 01:24:52,622
Or did he fondle only you and left?

1163
01:24:52,702 --> 01:24:53,761
Why are you speaking like this?

1164
01:24:54,675 --> 01:24:59,704
He said, 'Do not lose our son 
like you lost me.'

1165
01:24:59,784 --> 01:25:01,517
I am not feeling good since then.

1166
01:25:01,928 --> 01:25:03,066
Hey!

1167
01:25:03,673 --> 01:25:06,558
Will you listen to your mother 
and behave properly from now?

1168
01:25:07,525 --> 01:25:10,358
Mother, he has told rightly.

1169
01:25:10,438 --> 01:25:12,508
You always scold me.

1170
01:25:13,089 --> 01:25:14,896
Suppose I get angry and run away...

1171
01:25:14,976 --> 01:25:16,500
That is why he told like that.

1172
01:25:16,689 --> 01:25:18,486
I will not leave you and go away.

1173
01:25:18,665 --> 01:25:19,788
Okay. Come. Let us go.

1174
01:25:19,868 --> 01:25:22,053
-Where? 
-Let us go out.

1175
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:31,259
Where are we going?

1176
01:25:32,348 --> 01:25:34,357
Will you come with me 
only if I tell the place?

1177
01:25:34,677 --> 01:25:36,105
No.

1178
01:25:36,185 --> 01:25:39,605
I have not gone out like this 
without informing in house.

1179
01:25:40,323 --> 01:25:41,908
If anyone sees us...

1180
01:25:42,597 --> 01:25:44,085
That is why I am scared.

1181
01:25:44,361 --> 01:25:46,291
We will come back fast. 
Do not be scared.

1182
01:25:46,770 --> 01:25:47,872
Okay.

1183
01:25:49,125 --> 01:25:50,559
-My dear wife! 
-Yes?

1184
01:25:50,908 --> 01:25:52,336
You are coming with your husband.

1185

There are many people around us...

I am scared.

1191
01:26:43,414 --> 01:26:44,466
Okay.

1192
01:26:49,308 --> 01:26:50,504
Are you angry?

[zipping]

1194
01:26:58,623 --> 01:27:01,210
I have prepared food today.

1195
01:27:01,492 --> 01:27:02,519
Will you eat?

1196
01:27:03,016 --> 01:27:04,489
Can any human eat it?

1197
01:27:04,784 --> 01:27:05,805
I will eat.

1199
01:27:14,166 --> 01:27:16,867
[birds chirping]  
It is very tasty.

1200
01:27:21,896 --> 01:27:24,452
I said I do not want 
to eat just casually.

1201
01:27:24,724 --> 01:27:26,579
-How can you eat without giving me? 
-Who are you to me?

1202
01:27:26,659 --> 01:27:27,966
Why are you addressing me 
without respect?

1203
01:27:28,359 --> 01:27:31,223
How dare you ask me this?

1204
01:27:31,303 --> 01:27:33,510
Look! Do not call me without respect.

1205
01:27:33,619 --> 01:27:35,400
What will you do if I call?

1206
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:36,693
I will complain to my husband.

1207
01:27:59,770 --> 01:28:02,880
I want to live happily 
with you till death.

1208
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:08,279
What happened? 
Are you getting emotional?

1209
01:28:11,602 --> 01:28:15,531
Even if you tell me, 
I will not leave you till death.

-Yes, father.

Why are you so late?

1214
01:29:08,524 --> 01:29:09,977
That...

1215
01:29:10,356 --> 01:29:12,942
In College...

1216
01:29:13,022 --> 01:29:17,122
She might have had some special class.

1217
01:29:17,202 --> 01:29:18,282
Why are you asking her?

1218
01:29:18,362 --> 01:29:20,519
-You go and eat. 
-Okay, uncle.

1219
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:22,396

[anklets clinking]

1221
01:29:42,608 --> 01:29:45,446
You know her uncle's nature.

1222
01:29:46,259 --> 01:29:48,362
He saw you both 
when you were going together.

1223
01:29:48,872 --> 01:29:50,742
I am scared about his reaction.

1224
01:29:51,073 --> 01:29:53,222
Will everything be alright 
if we worry about that?

1225
01:29:53,302 --> 01:29:54,873
This matter has to 
come to light some day.

1226
01:29:54,953 --> 01:29:56,203
Let us think that today is that day.

Marudu!

There is a person named 
Kadiresan in Thanjavur.

1232
01:30:20,314 --> 01:30:21,603
He did business with me.

1233
01:30:21,683 --> 01:30:23,495
His son is the groom.

1234
01:30:23,971 --> 01:30:25,779
We met yesterday and were talking.

1235
01:30:26,154 --> 01:30:28,535
Suddenly he asked our 
daughter's hand for his son.

1236
01:30:28,615 --> 01:30:30,882
Theirs is also a traditional family.

1237
01:30:31,697 --> 01:30:33,076
Boy is working in Singapore.

1238
01:30:33,156 --> 01:30:34,961
He is coming home on 6 months leave.

1239
01:30:35,953 --> 01:30:38,692
So he said that we can perform 
their marriage during that time.

1240
01:30:38,772 --> 01:30:40,407
Even I agreed.

1241
01:30:45,403 --> 01:30:46,573
What is the hurry?

1242
01:30:46,653 --> 01:30:47,956
We can find some other groom for her.

1243
01:30:48,363 --> 01:30:51,234
Why should we get her married 
while she is studying?

1244
01:30:52,454 --> 01:30:53,919
It is a good alliance.

1245
01:30:54,686 --> 01:30:58,623
So I thought we can perform 
the marriage as early as possible.

1246
01:30:58,993 --> 01:31:00,873
What do you say?

1247
01:31:00,953 --> 01:31:05,177
Why should we refuse 
if the alliance is good.

1248
01:31:07,201 --> 01:31:09,054
Do you agree?

1249
01:31:09,709 --> 01:31:10,829
Okay, father.

1250
01:31:12,002 --> 01:31:14,375
We will send her to college 
after the engagement.

1251
01:31:14,455 --> 01:31:15,645
Okay.

1252
01:31:43,578 --> 01:31:45,688

Hey! I am Marudu.

1256
01:32:15,507 --> 01:32:16,590
I am Marudu.

1257
01:32:21,568 --> 01:32:23,306
I want to meet Poorni.

1261
01:32:42,870 --> 01:32:43,871
No.

1262
01:32:44,273 --> 01:32:45,679
Father's decision will not become true.

1263
01:32:45,759 --> 01:32:46,772
Go and sleep.

1264
01:32:48,849 --> 01:32:50,530
I will definitely marry Marudu.

1265
01:32:51,222 --> 01:32:52,362
I am hopeful.

1266
01:32:52,987 --> 01:32:54,725
You do not worry.[pat]

1267
01:33:04,209 --> 01:33:05,502
Has Marudu come?

1268
01:33:09,178 --> 01:33:14,886
"O Girl! Come."

1269
01:33:25,670 --> 01:33:29,381
"O Girl! Come."

1270
01:33:35,504 --> 01:33:40,808
-Oh, God! Marudu. Leave me. 
"-O Girl! Come."

1271
01:33:46,944 --> 01:33:48,720
Sir need not know.

1272
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:50,626
Hand him over to Police 
by saying that he came to rob.

1273
01:33:51,967 --> 01:33:52,970
-Sir! Please do not beat me. 
-Tell me.

1274
01:33:53,050 --> 01:33:54,326
I did not rob. Oh, God![slap]

-Sir! I did not.

1276

-Speak out. 
-Sir...

1277
01:33:57,796 --> 01:33:59,241
Are you robbing at this age?

1278
01:33:59,321 --> 01:34:00,861
-Please tell them not to beat him. 
-Are you lying?

1279
01:34:00,941 --> 01:34:03,545
-Tell. 
-Are you lying?

1280
01:34:03,625 --> 01:34:05,907
-Tell. 
-Don't beat him.

1281
01:34:05,987 --> 01:34:08,136
-Who are you? 
-Please do not beat him.

1282
01:34:08,216 --> 01:34:10,034
-Take her out. 
-Please do not beat him.

1283
01:34:10,114 --> 01:34:12,807
Oh, God! Don't beat him.

1284
01:34:12,887 --> 01:34:14,896
Sir, I beg of you.

1285
01:34:14,976 --> 01:34:17,436
Please do not beat my son.

1286
01:34:17,516 --> 01:34:19,487
Do not hit my son.[crying]

1287
01:34:19,567 --> 01:34:21,692
Please do not beat my son.

1288
01:34:21,772 --> 01:34:24,639
Please do not beat my son.

1289

-Mother...

1290

-I feel pain. 
-Sir...

1291
01:34:32,062 --> 01:34:34,636
-Please leave my son. 
-He is not a thief.

1292
01:34:34,943 --> 01:34:37,688
He loves the girl staying in that house.

1293
01:34:39,024 --> 01:34:41,305
He went to see that girl.

1294
01:34:41,648 --> 01:34:43,524
Please release him.

1295
01:34:46,125 --> 01:34:49,770
Oh, God! Alas!

1296
01:34:53,833 --> 01:34:55,490
Oh, God!

1297
01:34:55,570 --> 01:34:58,242
What is happening? Oh, God!

1298
01:34:58,322 --> 01:35:00,837
Why?

1299
01:35:00,917 --> 01:35:05,362
-Why should you suffer like this? 
-Oh, God!

1300
01:35:05,442 --> 01:35:07,167
Lift him.

1301
01:35:07,928 --> 01:35:08,949
Get up and go.

1302
01:35:09,029 --> 01:35:12,528
-Get up. 
-Come. Come.

1303
01:35:12,608 --> 01:35:13,909
-Get up. 
-Come fast.

1304
01:35:14,916 --> 01:35:16,324
Be careful.

1305
01:35:16,404 --> 01:35:17,450
Come. Come.

1306
01:35:20,364 --> 01:35:22,239
-Come fast. 
-Go.

1307
01:35:24,597 --> 01:35:27,686
It is not wrong to love someone.

1308
01:35:28,130 --> 01:35:29,944
But it is wrong to love 
someone who is of higher status.

1309
01:35:30,330 --> 01:35:31,334
Now who is suffering?

1310
01:35:32,582 --> 01:35:33,849
It is your mother who is suffering.

1311
01:35:35,293 --> 01:35:37,701
Try to understand and behave properly.

1312
01:35:38,628 --> 01:35:39,665
You may go.

1313
01:35:41,974 --> 01:35:43,064
Hey!

1314
01:35:45,485 --> 01:35:47,370
She is alone. Take care.

1315
01:35:47,588 --> 01:35:49,517
We are going to Thanjavur. 
Come.

1316
01:36:09,968 --> 01:36:15,046
"O Girl! Come."

1317
01:36:16,797 --> 01:36:22,407
"Who sowed the seed 
in an infertile land?"

1318
01:36:22,487 --> 01:36:28,013
"I have turned into a corpse."

01:36:28,093 --> 01:36:33,575
"He came and conquered my heart"

1320
01:36:33,655 --> 01:36:39,024
"He is called 'Thief' because of me."

1321
01:36:50,972 --> 01:36:53,939
"I pour you in my tongue"

1322
01:36:54,019 --> 01:36:56,509
"And take you to my heart"

1323
01:36:56,589 --> 01:36:58,877
"I love you a lot"

1324
01:36:58,957 --> 01:37:02,114
"My love is eternal"

1325
01:37:02,194 --> 01:37:05,019
"It is because of fate"

1326
01:37:05,099 --> 01:37:07,321
"That our love has 
become a barren land."

1327
01:37:07,401 --> 01:37:12,384
"I came here like the rain."

1328
01:37:12,464 --> 01:37:18,110
"Will our directions change?"

1329
01:37:18,190 --> 01:37:23,865
"Will we become single?"

1330
01:37:23,945 --> 01:37:29,391
"My fate will not change"

1331
01:37:29,471 --> 01:37:32,429
"Even if I pray"

1332
01:37:32,509 --> 01:37:36,165

I do not understand 
what is happening to me.

You will surely get Marudu.

from police station.

We will go and see him.

Poorni.

1358
01:39:08,993 --> 01:39:11,090
Do you love her a lot?

01:39:12,497 --> 01:39:13,534
Yes.

Please do not beat him again.

I request you. Please spare him.

1363
01:39:41,508 --> 01:39:43,426
Why are you pleading with him?

1364
01:39:43,506 --> 01:39:45,763
Can he go away unharmed 
from here after beating Marudu?

1365
01:39:45,843 --> 01:39:47,120
I have not come here to create problem.

1366

I have come to speak to Marudu.

1367

01:39:59,703 --> 01:40:00,935
I am fine.

Unpleasant things have happened.

1371
01:40:05,825 --> 01:40:07,129
Please do not keep it in mind.

1372
01:40:08,885 --> 01:40:12,164
What was my mistake? 
I came to see Poorni.

1373
01:40:12,510 --> 01:40:13,613
Of course, it was wrong.

1374
01:40:13,979 --> 01:40:15,778
But you handed me over to police

1375
01:40:15,858 --> 01:40:18,198
and made my mother fall at their feet.

1376
01:40:20,427 --> 01:40:22,558
I can understand. 
Do not feel sad about it.

My uncle is old fashioned.

He is bothered about his prestige.

He is also not wrong.

01:40:27,763 --> 01:40:29,143
He has only one daughter

1381

married in a decent family.

But I will be happy to get Poorni 
married to a person of her choice.

I will speak to my 
uncle and unite you both.

Now? No.

1410
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:34,863
Alas!

1411
01:44:34,943 --> 01:44:37,102
Alas...

1412
01:44:37,537 --> 01:44:40,197
-Oh, God! 
-Poorni...

1413
01:44:42,359 --> 01:44:45,402
Poorni...[crying]

1414
01:45:37,736 --> 01:45:40,251
You killed our girl

1415
01:45:40,331 --> 01:45:42,996
because I made your mother 
fall at the Policeman's feet.

1416
01:46:01,337 --> 01:46:03,801
We brought her up with lot of affection.

1417
01:46:07,431 --> 01:46:10,970
Alas! But she is dead now.

1418
01:46:12,626 --> 01:46:16,105
Alas! I cannot bear it.

1419
01:46:21,215 --> 01:46:24,220
-My dear! 
-My dear!

1420
01:46:24,874 --> 01:46:28,417
She is dead! She has left us.

1421
01:46:30,540 --> 01:46:33,595
What shall I do now?

1422
01:46:35,407 --> 01:46:38,312
My daughter is dead.

1423
01:46:40,847 --> 01:46:41,891
You hit me with slippers

1424
01:46:41,971 --> 01:46:44,033
when I asked for your daughter's hand.

1425
01:46:44,113 --> 01:46:45,153
Cry.

1426
01:46:45,233 --> 01:46:47,056
Cry now.

1427
01:47:25,552 --> 01:47:27,623
Why have you brought me here?

1428
01:47:28,249 --> 01:47:29,677
Let us talk.

1429
01:47:35,720 --> 01:47:37,712
Marudu is waiting for me there.

1430
01:47:38,077 --> 01:47:39,422
Come. Let us go.

1431
01:47:40,828 --> 01:47:42,109
Come. Let us go there.

1432
01:47:42,189 --> 01:47:44,447
I can still hear the sound 
of the beating I got with slippers.

1433
01:47:46,852 --> 01:47:49,107
I am unable to digest that pain.[sighs]

1434
01:47:51,518 --> 01:47:53,219
If I return back that 
pain to your father?

1435
01:47:56,380 --> 01:47:59,937
Why are you speaking like this? 
I am scared.

1436
01:48:00,358 --> 01:48:03,749
Marudu is waiting there. I will go.

1437
01:48:04,546 --> 01:48:05,732
Do not cry.

1438
01:48:07,323 --> 01:48:08,708
Do not cry.

1439
01:48:09,780 --> 01:48:11,199
I cannot bear it.

1440
01:48:14,163 --> 01:48:16,083
But your father should cry.

1441
01:48:41,185 --> 01:48:42,861
Uncle!

1442
01:49:01,338 --> 01:49:03,105
I will go and inform them.

1443
01:49:10,978 --> 01:49:14,083
My dear daughter!

1444
01:49:17,247 --> 01:49:23,013
"My heart refuses to pardon"

1445
01:49:26,546 --> 01:49:32,412
"Such inhuman people."

1446
01:49:36,106 --> 01:49:41,741
"My heart is not paining"

1447
01:49:44,616 --> 01:49:50,334
"He has turned into a living doll."

1448
01:49:54,002 --> 01:49:56,625
[screaming]

1449
01:50:20,873 --> 01:50:22,233
[motorbike approaching]

1450
01:50:33,649 --> 01:50:35,739
MARUDU 
POORNI

1451
01:50:40,953 --> 01:50:42,859
[tyres screech] 
[loud bang]

1452
01:50:45,168 --> 01:50:47,783
[engine reviving]

1453
01:50:53,041 --> 01:50:54,072
[hiccup]

1454
01:50:59,648 --> 01:51:02,942
[vehicle approaching]

1455
01:51:12,383 --> 01:51:13,664
[hiccup]

1456
01:51:31,736 --> 01:51:33,379
I will go and inform about this.
