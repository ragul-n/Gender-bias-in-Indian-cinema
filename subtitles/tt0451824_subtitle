1
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:21,375
It's done.

2
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:25,846
Send this first thing
in the morning.

3
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:26,981
Yes, sir.

4
00:02:47,468 --> 00:02:51,872
Thanks. You have learnt
this from me, have you?

5
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,042
Just four or five per day.

6
00:02:56,944 --> 00:02:58,078
What would people think?

7
00:02:59,213 --> 00:03:01,549
That you are learning less of
work and more of bad habits from me.

8
00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:03,551
Let them think.

9
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:05,219
Tomorrow morning 10 o clock.

10
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:51,532
What's the matter Mr. Ravi?
You are late again!

11
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:53,934
Just got tied up with the work.

12
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:56,270
It is nice and breezy
on the terrace.

13
00:03:56,337 --> 00:03:58,472
How about a cigarette each? I
was getting bored all alone.

14
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,343
Some other time Mr. Tapan.
I am a little tired today.

15
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,945
In our government service
we are done by 5 o clock..

16
00:04:05,012 --> 00:04:07,615
.. but there is no telling
about your timings.

17
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:52,993
Why didn't you take my call?

18
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:57,131
I was busy.
- Busy with what? - With work.

19
00:04:57,198 --> 00:04:58,999
I know about your work.

20
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:01,535
You must have been with
your assistant, Reena.

21
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:06,273
Have you finished talking?
- No. Today I want to know clearly.

22
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,009
What is it between
you and that Reena?

23
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:13,180
At least clean your mouth. Please.

24
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:20,020
Don't pretend to be sleeping just
because it is about Reena.

25
00:05:20,087 --> 00:05:21,188
Do you get me?

26
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:24,625
Sheila, I've to be up early tomorrow
morning and.. - And go to Reena?

27
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:27,161
There you go again!

28
00:05:27,228 --> 00:05:28,362
I am sure you are not
ashamed about it!

29
00:05:28,429 --> 00:05:31,031
We have two kids. What will they
feel when they find out about it?

30
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:33,033
Why would you be bothered?

31
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,703
Just enjoy and go around
with that girl!

32
00:05:37,371 --> 00:05:38,506
You are out of your mind!

33
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:40,040
If I were out of my mind
then I would not..

34
00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:41,375
.. have been able to understand
this affair of yours.

35
00:05:41,442 --> 00:05:43,043
That girl is out of her mind.

36
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,045
That's why she is having an
affair with a married man.

37
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:48,382
Be glad that I didn't tell my
mummy and daddy anything.

38
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,051
What is there to tell about?

39
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:53,053
Sheila, Reena is only my assistant.

40
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,188
I know everything!

41
00:05:54,255 --> 00:05:56,390
I know what she is to you and what
you are to her. I know everything!

42
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:07,067
Papa, there is a new issue of
Superman in the comic store.

43
00:06:07,535 --> 00:06:08,736
We can go and pick it
up on Sunday. Ok?

44
00:06:08,803 --> 00:06:10,070
There is no need for that!

45
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:11,272
If you are really keen
on reading you..

46
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:12,540
.. could read your schoolbooks.

47
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:14,608
And you? I spend my days
and nights teaching them.

48
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:16,677
You are spoiling the children by
encouraging their unwanted habits.

49
00:06:16,744 --> 00:06:18,679
You are not at all bothered
about their studies.

50
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:21,749
You are so busy with your
important work, aren't you?

51
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:27,087
I am going for my bath.

52
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:29,089
Don't leave the soap in
the water. Make it fast!

53
00:06:29,757 --> 00:06:33,427
Coffee? - No. How many
times will you ask me?

54
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:38,766
You have asked me this ten
times since morning. Sorry.

55
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:43,270
You look tired. So I thought..

56
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:47,108
I couldn't sleep well last night.

57
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:50,111
Come on. Let us go and have coffee.

58
00:06:58,786 --> 00:07:03,124
How is Raj's work coming through?
- He is settling.

59
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:06,460
Did you speak to your Dad?

60
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:10,131
Dad is in Tokyo. For a month.

61
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:13,134
I'll talk to him when he gets back
after he finishes his work.

62
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,136
Your Dad is never going to be free.

63
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:17,138
You will have be the one
to take the initiative.

64
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:20,307
I know. I'm just a little nervous.

65
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:24,812
Don't know how dad will react
when he hears about Raj and me.

66
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,749
Firstly I came to Bombay from
London against his wish.

67
00:07:28,816 --> 00:07:30,818
And now he will say that I have
chosen a guy for myself too.

68
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:34,822
Either now or later you will
have to talk about it.

69
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:39,160
As long as you are happy I don't
think your dad will object to it

70
00:07:39,627 --> 00:07:40,694
I hope so.

71
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:47,334
Didn't you bring your car?
- Raj is coming to pick me.

72
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:56,177
Hi Sweetie!
- Hello Dear.

73
00:07:56,644 --> 00:07:58,179
How was the day?
- Good.

74
00:07:58,913 --> 00:08:01,182
Hi Raj.
- Hi. How are you?

75
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:04,185
Good. - I am in a bit of a rush.
See you later. - Bye.

76
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:05,519
Ok, Sir. Take care.

77
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:07,321
Shall we go?
- Yes.

78
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:13,194
Your boss seemed to
be in a great hurry?

79
00:08:14,261 --> 00:08:16,730
He doesn't waste time
with useless people.

80
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:19,533
He is a Prime Minister, isn't he?

81
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:23,737
He is for me. Ok?

82
00:08:31,946 --> 00:08:33,214
Greetings, Sir.
- Greetings.

83
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,749
Hey maid! Come on time tomorrow.
Do you get me?

84
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:37,818
I don't like this fuss everyday.

85
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,578
Papa, had called.

86
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:06,781
He was suggesting that we could
all go to Shirdi together.

87
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:09,850
Sheila, if you want to go,
then no problem.

88
00:09:10,518 --> 00:09:13,854
But I have a lot of work and
I can't leave my work and go.

89
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:16,257
Please. - Or is it that you don't
want to leave Reena and go?

90
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:20,261
Sheila, don't talk such
things now. Please.

91
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:22,663
Why? Just because it is about Reena
you want to let it be, is it?

92
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,265
I am not in a mood to
listen to anything.

93
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:25,933
Now you don't even like
to hear my voice, do you?

94
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,535
Why? Is my voice so bad?

95
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:29,270
It doesn't matter whether
the voice is good or bad.

96
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:31,539
What is the point in talking
rubbish about somebody?

97
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:33,274
And you don't even know
anything about Reena! - Okay!

98
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,276
So now you can't bear to listen
to anything about Reena!

99
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:37,945
As if she weren't your assistant
but some great thing!

100
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:40,414
You may let your imaginations
run amuck.

101
00:09:40,481 --> 00:09:42,283
Only when the effect of the spell
that Reena has cast on you..

102
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:44,285
.. fades will anything sensible
to enter your brain!

103
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:46,287
I don't know what she
keeps doing to you!

104
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:47,421
Sheila!

105
00:09:47,488 --> 00:09:50,458
So you will hit me,
will you? Hit me!

106
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:53,294
Hit me! Why did you stop!?

107
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:06,307
The machine has hung, Sir.

108
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:11,912
Call the engineer.

109
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:27,328
Is there any problem?

110
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:40,674
Then today..

111
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:46,881
Sheila thinks there is an
affair between you and me.

112
00:10:47,515 --> 00:10:48,682
What?!

113
00:10:50,618 --> 00:10:52,353
She keeps parroting the
same thing day and night.

114
00:10:54,422 --> 00:10:57,858
I don't know how this
thing entered her mind.

115
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:02,696
Shall I try talking to her?

116
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:06,967
If you speak to her she will
be instigated further.

117
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:12,039
I know her inside out.

118
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,777
She just finds excuses
to pick up a fight.

119
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:22,383
Our marriage has not worked.

120
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:28,389
If I wasn't bothered
about the kids then..

121
00:11:28,456 --> 00:11:32,726
.. maybe I would have
divorced her by now.

122
00:11:44,939 --> 00:11:46,407
How long will it take?

123
00:11:46,474 --> 00:11:47,741
It will take a long time.

124
00:12:06,494 --> 00:12:09,830
Ravi Sir's wife thinks there is
something between sir and me?

125
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:12,900
What?
- Stupid!

126
00:12:13,768 --> 00:12:16,837
Boss's wife thinks that there is
an affair between boss and me.

127
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:19,774
She fights with him everyday.

128
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:23,778
Is this something to laugh about?

129
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:26,914
At least there is something
hot about Ravi.

130
00:12:26,981 --> 00:12:28,115
So what if it is just a rumor?

131
00:12:28,182 --> 00:12:30,184
It is not a nice thing to
poke fun at a nice man.

132
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:31,786
Nice man! My foot!

133
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:34,455
Girls like men who remain
frightened of their wives.

134
00:12:34,522 --> 00:12:37,992
As if you are not scared of me?

135
00:12:38,626 --> 00:12:41,128
Scared!
- Aren't you scared of me?

136
00:12:42,797 --> 00:12:44,465
You have many wrong notions
about yourself.

137
00:12:44,532 --> 00:12:48,469
Hey! If you took my words lightly
then you will repent!

138
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:51,472
Really! How?

139
00:12:54,542 --> 00:12:56,477
Hey! Hey! Hey!

140
00:13:03,084 --> 00:13:05,486
If your dad wishes he could buy
you four studios like this one.

141
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,488
Why don't you quit?

142
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:11,492
Raj, I am upset for Ravi Sir.
Not with the job.

143
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,496
I am learning so much from him.
He is such a great guy.

144
00:13:16,564 --> 00:13:18,833
Not like you. Do you understand?

145
00:13:37,251 --> 00:13:40,521
You had a lot of work to do!
You were very busy!

146
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:43,124
The machine got spoilt.

147
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,525
Or is it that Reena
didn't come today.

148
00:13:44,592 --> 00:13:46,527
When Papa, asked you
to go to Shirdi you..

149
00:13:46,594 --> 00:13:48,062
.. made up an excuse about your work.

150
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:49,530
Sheila, be normal at least
at some time, will you?

151
00:13:49,597 --> 00:13:51,198
Ravi, you too must speak the
truth at least at sometime.

152
00:13:51,265 --> 00:13:54,535
Lies and more lies! There is
a limit to shamelessness.

153
00:13:54,602 --> 00:13:56,070
Enough! That's too much
of your nonsense!

154
00:13:56,137 --> 00:13:57,538
Am I talking nonsense?

155
00:13:57,605 --> 00:13:59,540
Why don't you just say
that you don't..

156
00:13:59,607 --> 00:14:01,075
.. feel like working because
she didn't come?

157
00:14:01,142 --> 00:14:02,543
You are irritated and
are venting the..

158
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:03,878
.. frustration by getting
angry with me.

159
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:05,079
Sheila, stop it!

160
00:14:05,146 --> 00:14:07,081
Don't try to show all this
anger in the house! Get it?

161
00:14:07,148 --> 00:14:08,549
If you are missing her so much why..

162
00:14:08,616 --> 00:14:11,152
.. don't you go and remain
with that whore! - Shut up!

163
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:14,288
If really wish to hit me so much
then why don't you go ahead?

164
00:14:14,355 --> 00:14:15,956
Why do you stop again and again?

165
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:18,559
I will really hit you if you
don't stop this nonsense.

166
00:14:18,626 --> 00:14:21,162
And you think I will keep quiet
after you hit me, don't you?

167
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:25,032
You just don't know to keep quiet.
That is your problem!

168
00:14:25,099 --> 00:14:27,568
Don't shout! Or else
I too will hit you!

169
00:14:29,637 --> 00:14:34,074
You hit me! - Now you
keep your mouth shut.

170
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:46,587
Just because I don't say anything
you are going too far!

171
00:14:46,654 --> 00:14:48,255
Just too far!

172
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:57,865
Get up Sheila! I am sorry. Get up.

173
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,604
Sheila. Sheila.

174
00:15:24,692 --> 00:15:25,793
Sheila.

175
00:16:20,281 --> 00:16:24,852
Sheila, Sheila. Sheila.

176
00:17:30,484 --> 00:17:34,755
Accident?
- Yes. - Do you think I am crazy?

177
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:38,259
I hit her hard by mistake.

178
00:17:39,827 --> 00:17:42,763
Her head hit the cot.

179
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:16,797
Sir, the door was open and I kept
ringing the bell like a fool.

180
00:20:23,591 --> 00:20:27,261
Sir, it is the day of my salary.
Please tell madam about it.

181
00:20:28,596 --> 00:20:30,598
She has gone out. Take it later.

182
00:20:30,664 --> 00:20:32,933
No, sir. I need to go to the doctor.

183
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,335
What if you gave me the money?

184
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:37,204
Didn't I tell you Sheila would come
and settle your dues? Go now.

185
00:20:40,107 --> 00:20:42,109
Why couldn't she have gone
after giving me my pay?

186
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,612
No one bothers about the poor.

187
00:21:51,746 --> 00:21:56,016
Where is mummy? Has she gone to
the aunty on the second floor?

188
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,018
No. She has gone out.
- Out?

189
00:21:58,419 --> 00:22:01,021
General store? I too wanted
to buy color pencils.

190
00:22:01,088 --> 00:22:04,024
She has gone to Shirdi.
- Shirdi?

191
00:22:04,091 --> 00:22:05,226
With your grandparents.

192
00:22:05,292 --> 00:22:08,562
Without us? - Mummy said that
she would take us too.

193
00:22:08,629 --> 00:22:10,498
Mummy will come back
after a day or two.

194
00:22:10,564 --> 00:22:12,566
But mummy had said.. - Didn't
I say that she would come back?

195
00:22:12,633 --> 00:22:14,368
Come on now. Both of
you go to your room.

196
00:22:14,635 --> 00:22:15,770
Change your clothes.

197
00:22:20,207 --> 00:22:21,575
Papa, I am hungry.

198
00:22:21,642 --> 00:22:24,044
First change your clothes
I'll serve the food.

199
00:22:47,134 --> 00:22:48,669
Papa, my bat is inside.

200
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,741
No it isn't.

201
00:22:53,808 --> 00:22:56,477
It is. Near the bed. If forgot
it there last night.

202
00:22:56,677 --> 00:23:02,583
It's not here. - You will not find
it. Open. Open the door Papa.

203
00:23:05,152 --> 00:23:06,420
I am changing my clothes.

204
00:23:08,155 --> 00:23:09,290
Make it fast.

205
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:11,092
Karan, behave yourself.

206
00:23:22,636 --> 00:23:24,638
You said that you were changing,
weren't you?

207
00:23:25,172 --> 00:23:26,574
I could only if you allowed
me to do so in peace.

208
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,109
Now come in soon and take your bat.

209
00:23:38,185 --> 00:23:40,121
Mummy must have kept
it in the cupboard.

210
00:24:06,213 --> 00:24:07,481
Got it?
- Yes, Papa.

211
00:24:08,649 --> 00:24:10,151
Don't misplace it hereafter.
- Ok.

212
00:24:13,954 --> 00:24:15,156
What are you doing, Raj?

213
00:24:15,689 --> 00:24:17,558
I have been interested
in wildlife..

214
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:19,160
.. photography since
childhood. - Really?

215
00:24:20,828 --> 00:24:23,164
And photographs of
wet cats are rare.

216
00:24:23,664 --> 00:24:26,167
Wet cat? Cats also use their claws.

217
00:24:27,435 --> 00:24:29,503
I like cats that use their
claws very much.

218
00:24:32,573 --> 00:24:33,674
Get it.

219
00:24:39,447 --> 00:24:40,581
Yes, Ravi sir?

220
00:24:40,648 --> 00:24:42,183
Reena, I need your car.

221
00:24:42,516 --> 00:24:44,652
I have to pick up some relatives
from the station.

222
00:24:44,718 --> 00:24:47,188
Of course. - I'll come
and collect the keys.

223
00:24:48,589 --> 00:24:49,690
Thanks.

224
00:25:06,373 --> 00:25:12,213
Car? Why? Is the editor going on
a picnic with his wife and kids?

225
00:25:12,747 --> 00:25:14,749
No. How would he go on a picnic?

226
00:25:14,815 --> 00:25:18,486
Didn't I tell you that there is
some tension in his married life?

227
00:25:18,819 --> 00:25:21,288
If he is under tension why
is he ruining our program?

228
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:25,226
What is so great about our programs?

229
00:25:25,292 --> 00:25:27,228
Last time you called
me for a movie..

230
00:25:27,294 --> 00:25:29,230
.. and forgot to come yourself.
Remember?

231
00:25:29,296 --> 00:25:30,631
Don't defend.

232
00:25:30,698 --> 00:25:34,235
Come one Raj. I'm just trying
to be a bit helpful.

233
00:25:37,705 --> 00:25:38,773
Ok.

234
00:25:52,853 --> 00:25:56,857
I'll just be back. Don't
be up to any mischief.

235
00:25:58,325 --> 00:26:00,261
Stay in your room. Ok?

236
00:27:00,387 --> 00:27:01,989
Hi.
- Hi.

237
00:27:04,792 --> 00:27:06,327
Hi, Sir.
- Hi.

238
00:27:06,393 --> 00:27:08,329
The..
- Car keys? I'll just get them.

239
00:27:08,395 --> 00:27:10,731
Come in sir.

240
00:27:13,334 --> 00:27:14,468
Please sit down.

241
00:27:14,535 --> 00:27:17,004
Reena, I am in a bit of a hurry.
- Just a minute.

242
00:27:18,939 --> 00:27:20,674
Cigarette?
- No. Thanks.

243
00:27:25,413 --> 00:27:27,848
How is your wife?

244
00:27:31,018 --> 00:27:32,686
She is fine.
- Here you are, Sir.

245
00:27:33,521 --> 00:27:35,356
Thanks. - You are welcome.

246
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,362
Are you in your right senses?

247
00:27:41,862 --> 00:27:42,963
Now what have I done?

248
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:45,032
I told you that the boss is having
some tensions with his wife.

249
00:27:45,099 --> 00:27:47,368
Then why did you have
to ask him questions?

250
00:27:47,635 --> 00:27:49,370
Don't make a mountain
out of a molehill.

251
00:27:49,437 --> 00:27:51,372
You can be so insensitive
sometimes, Raj.

252
00:27:51,439 --> 00:27:52,640
Just trying to socialize.

253
00:30:18,252 --> 00:30:21,522
Mr. Ravi, you didn't
come for the wedding.

254
00:30:21,589 --> 00:30:22,656
I was a little..

255
00:30:22,723 --> 00:30:24,725
Why do you do this alone?
Let me help you.

256
00:30:24,792 --> 00:30:28,028
No. There is no need for that.
- What are neighbors for?

257
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:31,132
My God! It is very heavy.
What's in it?

258
00:30:32,066 --> 00:30:35,536
Some tapes of my studio
and some books.

259
00:30:35,603 --> 00:30:36,670
Ok. Ok.

260
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,562
Enough. Thanks. I'll
take it from here.

261
00:31:01,629 --> 00:31:02,830
I am here to help you.

262
00:31:02,897 --> 00:31:04,565
No thanks. Why do you worry?

263
00:31:04,632 --> 00:31:07,735
That is all right.
- I forgot to lock my door.

264
00:31:08,636 --> 00:31:10,037
Shelia madam is there, isn't she?

265
00:31:10,104 --> 00:31:12,239
She has gone to Shirdi.
- Shirdi?

266
00:31:12,907 --> 00:31:14,575
Please go and check
the door, will you?

267
00:33:36,117 --> 00:33:37,718
Sir, your carton is about to fall.

268
00:36:11,038 --> 00:36:18,946
Mummy! Mummy! Mummy! Mummy!

269
00:36:21,615 --> 00:36:26,053
Mummy! Mummy!

270
00:36:35,963 --> 00:36:37,231
What's the matter, child?

271
00:36:37,298 --> 00:36:38,899
I got scared.

272
00:37:28,482 --> 00:37:31,018
'Or you don't want to
leave Reena and go?'

273
00:37:31,085 --> 00:37:33,287
'Why? Is my voice so bad?'

274
00:37:34,622 --> 00:37:36,290
'There is a limit to shamelessness. '

275
00:37:39,026 --> 00:37:42,630
'Don't shout! Or else
I too will hit you!'

276
00:38:01,148 --> 00:38:07,188
Nimi! Karan! Wake up! Nimi!

277
00:38:28,075 --> 00:38:30,010
I'm so sorry I'm late.

278
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:33,547
Its ok.

279
00:38:38,085 --> 00:38:41,088
I hope you didn't have any
problem without the car.

280
00:38:41,155 --> 00:38:44,358
No.
- Thanks. - Your welcome.

281
00:38:44,425 --> 00:38:46,193
Take out tape 4 and 5.

282
00:38:56,203 --> 00:38:59,273
How is it now?
- The color is not right.

283
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:01,675
Not that. Your wife.

284
00:39:05,379 --> 00:39:06,647
She is fine.

285
00:39:06,714 --> 00:39:08,716
I am sorry if I am getting too..

286
00:39:08,783 --> 00:39:12,453
No. Its ok. Sheila has gone
to Shirdi. - Shirdi?

287
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,389
With her parents. Change the tape.

288
00:39:22,463 --> 00:39:29,236
Hello! Yes. He is here. One minute.

289
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:31,472
Sheila's father.

290
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,607
Sir.

291
00:39:47,254 --> 00:39:48,689
Hello!
- Hello.

292
00:39:48,756 --> 00:39:51,826
Son Ravi, where are you?

293
00:39:51,892 --> 00:39:54,161
I am unable to reach
you on your mobile.

294
00:39:54,695 --> 00:39:56,497
I am at the studio.

295
00:39:56,564 --> 00:40:00,267
May be the mobile is unable
to catch the signal.

296
00:40:00,334 --> 00:40:03,270
I tried your number at home. No
one is picking up the phone.

297
00:40:03,337 --> 00:40:09,276
Where is Shelia? Ravi.. Hello.

298
00:40:09,343 --> 00:40:10,444
What do you mean?

299
00:40:11,178 --> 00:40:15,116
Sheila went to your house
to go to Shirdi.

300
00:40:15,182 --> 00:40:19,286
Sheila! But son, we cancelled
our program.

301
00:40:19,353 --> 00:40:22,289
But she left last afternoon.
- What?

302
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:29,130
Last afternoon. But
she never got here.

303
00:40:29,196 --> 00:40:32,299
What? How could that be?

304
00:40:32,366 --> 00:40:38,205
But where could she have gone.
No phone call. No information.

305
00:40:38,272 --> 00:40:39,640
Do you think..

306
00:40:39,707 --> 00:40:43,210
Don't worry, Papa. I'll come there.

307
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:46,814
May be she has gone to
some friend's house.

308
00:40:48,215 --> 00:40:50,217
Yes, Son. Come soon.

309
00:40:50,284 --> 00:40:51,652
Ok, Papa.

310
00:40:57,224 --> 00:40:59,493
Sheila, didn't reach her
parents house last night.

311
00:41:15,676 --> 00:41:18,245
Ravi! Ravi, did you
find out anything?

312
00:41:18,312 --> 00:41:19,714
No, mother.

313
00:41:20,247 --> 00:41:21,849
Ravi, he has been making phone
calls since morning.

314
00:41:21,916 --> 00:41:23,184
He couldn't find out anything.

315
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:25,586
Didn't she say anything before
leaving? Where did she go?

316
00:41:25,653 --> 00:41:27,354
She is not at Pinky aunty's house.

317
00:41:27,421 --> 00:41:29,256
Did you ask Archana?
- Yes. She is not there either.

318
00:41:29,323 --> 00:41:32,359
I have made calls to Archana,
Uncle, Kumar and everyone.

319
00:41:32,426 --> 00:41:35,196
You both weren't fighting, were you?

320
00:41:35,262 --> 00:41:37,198
Mummy, that is the usual thing.

321
00:41:37,264 --> 00:41:39,266
Wonder when this girl will change?

322
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:41,402
She quarrels at the
smallest of things.

323
00:41:41,469 --> 00:41:43,704
Has she gone away somewhere
in a fit of rage?

324
00:41:43,771 --> 00:41:45,873
She has put all of us
through so much worry.

325
00:41:47,274 --> 00:41:49,844
Or has she done something
to herself?

326
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:51,545
Mummy, don't bring such
things to your mind.

327
00:41:51,612 --> 00:41:55,282
Ravi! Ravi, I am very scared!
- Sit down. Come here.

328
00:41:55,383 --> 00:41:56,784
She has been the aggressive
kind from her childhood.

329
00:41:56,851 --> 00:41:58,419
But she has never
run away from home.

330
00:41:58,486 --> 00:42:01,555
Hello! One minute! Look, now
don't start crying. Please.

331
00:42:01,622 --> 00:42:03,290
Where could she be?

332
00:42:03,357 --> 00:42:05,226
Hello! Hello!

333
00:42:14,301 --> 00:42:20,241
Listen! Listen! Just complain
to the police. Please.

334
00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:23,744
Drink this water.

335
00:42:25,312 --> 00:42:27,248
Do something.

336
00:42:41,328 --> 00:42:45,599
Sir, for information about
missing people..

337
00:42:45,666 --> 00:42:47,268
Go and sit there.

338
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:33,948
Hello! What is it? No.
I'll call you back.

339
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:38,486
What is yours?

340
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:41,922
My Mrs.
- Do you have her photo?

341
00:43:49,997 --> 00:43:55,503
Who is this? - Wife.
- My daughter.

342
00:43:56,404 --> 00:43:58,739
Tell me her name?
- Sheila Patwardhan.

343
00:43:58,806 --> 00:44:01,509
What did you say?
- Sheila Patwardhan. Patwardhan.

344
00:44:01,575 --> 00:44:04,011
Sheila Patwardhan. Tell
me the address.

345
00:44:11,419 --> 00:44:16,424
Hello? - Hello, Ravi Sir. I
hope everything is all right?

346
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:20,361
She is missing. I have reported
it to the police.

347
00:44:20,428 --> 00:44:24,432
Oh God! Don't worry sir. Everything
will be all right.

348
00:44:24,498 --> 00:44:27,368
Thanks Reena. Bye.

349
00:44:31,439 --> 00:44:35,443
Karan, have your food. Look
Nimi is eating too.

350
00:44:40,715 --> 00:44:43,451
Mummy will be back.
Nothing will happen.

351
00:44:43,718 --> 00:44:48,055
Come on be a good boy. Have
your food. Have a little bit.

352
00:44:51,459 --> 00:44:53,394
Nimi, eat.

353
00:45:48,783 --> 00:45:49,984
Hello!

354
00:45:50,051 --> 00:45:52,520
Son Ravi.
- Yes, Papa.

355
00:45:52,586 --> 00:45:54,889
Inspector Deshpande had called.

356
00:45:57,625 --> 00:45:59,894
They found a body last night.

357
00:46:01,529 --> 00:46:06,667
It can't be Sheila. But Son,
we must have a look.

358
00:46:07,535 --> 00:46:09,003
Where did they find the body?

359
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:14,875
In the forest ahead of Pawai.
In the water.

360
00:46:15,209 --> 00:46:19,647
Son, the inspector has asked us
to come to St. Johns hospital.

361
00:47:18,606 --> 00:47:23,711
Ravi! What has happened?

362
00:47:33,054 --> 00:47:39,093
Mr. Ravi Patwardhan? Inspector
Tejpal Randhawa.

363
00:47:46,901 --> 00:47:50,237
I am sorry I have to talk
about this at such a time.

364
00:47:50,905 --> 00:47:55,743
But it is my duty is such. Only
such things are talked about.

365
00:47:56,911 --> 00:48:00,981
It is a different thing if people
stop doing untoward things.

366
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:08,789
But until that happens only
such talks will take place.

367
00:48:12,927 --> 00:48:14,929
So tell me how did your wife die?

368
00:48:14,995 --> 00:48:20,267
What do you mean? You will
find that out, won't you?

369
00:48:20,334 --> 00:48:22,770
I am asking you so that
I can find out.

370
00:48:25,339 --> 00:48:27,675
I thought that in all this time
you would have recollected..

371
00:48:27,742 --> 00:48:29,610
.. something else that you might
have forgotten to mention..

372
00:48:29,677 --> 00:48:31,779
.. at the time of placing
the police complaint.

373
00:48:33,114 --> 00:48:35,616
We also understand that sometimes..

374
00:48:35,683 --> 00:48:37,785
.. one is unable to say everything.

375
00:48:37,852 --> 00:48:39,620
One forgets.

376
00:48:40,688 --> 00:48:42,790
To remind is our duty.

377
00:48:45,025 --> 00:48:48,796
So do you recollect something that
you forgot to tell us that day?

378
00:48:51,699 --> 00:48:55,636
No.
- Do you suspect anyone?

379
00:48:55,703 --> 00:48:58,973
Or was there any animosity
with someone? - No.

380
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:03,811
So do you think that Sheila
might have committed suicide?

381
00:49:04,712 --> 00:49:06,647
When did I say that?

382
00:49:06,981 --> 00:49:10,985
No. You didn't say that. But
if you don't suspect anyone.

383
00:49:11,052 --> 00:49:13,654
And if you don't have any
enemies then I assumed..

384
00:49:13,721 --> 00:49:16,824
.. that you are thinking that
Sheila committed suicide.

385
00:49:17,992 --> 00:49:21,996
Did she have a reason to
commit suicide? - No.

386
00:49:27,735 --> 00:49:29,670
In that case if I recollect
something..

387
00:49:29,737 --> 00:49:31,172
.. then I shall call for you again.

388
00:49:36,277 --> 00:49:38,012
I'll just meet uncle. Bye, Ravi.

389
00:49:56,864 --> 00:49:59,100
What was that inspector telling you?

390
00:50:01,035 --> 00:50:02,770
You know, don't you?

391
00:50:03,371 --> 00:50:06,307
In such cases the first
suspect is the husband.

392
00:50:16,951 --> 00:50:18,185
It's so difficult
to prepare Biryani.

393
00:50:30,331 --> 00:50:31,799
It's not easy.

394
00:50:33,968 --> 00:50:35,970
Whoever has prepared it,
he's a great chef.

395
00:50:41,208 --> 00:50:43,144
Mansukh brother.
- Yes, sir.

396
00:50:44,078 --> 00:50:45,212
Give me a handkerchief.

397
00:50:52,286 --> 00:50:56,824
Whoever is behind this.. that
person is very intelligent.

398
00:50:58,092 --> 00:51:00,828
You mean to say that Ravi very
cunningly killed Sheila..

399
00:51:01,896 --> 00:51:03,831
How did this Ravi come
into the picture?

400
00:51:04,231 --> 00:51:05,833
Then who else could that person be?

401
00:51:07,101 --> 00:51:08,169
What are you talking about?

402
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:10,237
About Sheila's case.

403
00:51:12,306 --> 00:51:13,841
This is the limit, my friend.

404
00:51:14,241 --> 00:51:16,510
I'm praising the person who
has made this Biryani.

405
00:51:16,577 --> 00:51:17,845
And you are not even
listening to me.

406
00:51:20,014 --> 00:51:21,182
You're great.

407
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:26,520
What did his father-in-law say?

408
00:51:28,122 --> 00:51:29,857
Whose? Ustar's?

409
00:51:32,326 --> 00:51:34,361
Eat your food. Why are
you eating my brains?

410
00:51:37,398 --> 00:51:38,866
Mansukh brother.

411
00:51:41,035 --> 00:51:42,203
Are the children asleep?

412
00:51:44,338 --> 00:51:47,041
Yes. Just now they fell asleep.

413
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:53,047
But, son, it's difficult
to manage Karan.

414
00:51:55,216 --> 00:51:59,286
Nimita is just a kid. She doesn't
understand all this.

415
00:52:27,381 --> 00:52:29,917
Sir, Sheila Patwardhan's
post mortem report.

416
00:52:31,252 --> 00:52:32,520
Sir, shall I get something
for you to eat?

417
00:52:32,586 --> 00:52:33,921
Later.

418
00:53:30,578 --> 00:53:34,448
Sheila's body was cramped in
a way like how a kid sleeps.

419
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:38,319
She must have been reclining..

420
00:53:38,386 --> 00:53:39,987
.. in some kind of a thing
for quite a long time.

421
00:53:40,254 --> 00:53:41,322
But who?

422
00:53:43,324 --> 00:53:45,326
This is the question that's
troubling my mind.

423
00:53:47,395 --> 00:53:48,996
We found the body floating
in the water.

424
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:50,998
There was nothing nearby.

425
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:57,004
Suitcase, sleeping bag,
luggage.. nothing.

426
00:53:57,405 --> 00:53:59,006
But why would someone pack?

427
00:54:00,274 --> 00:54:01,475
That person could have
killed her there only..

428
00:54:01,542 --> 00:54:02,610
.. and dropped her body in the water.

429
00:54:03,477 --> 00:54:05,613
What if she wasn't killed
in the jungle?

430
00:54:08,182 --> 00:54:10,017
Good point, Wagle.

431
00:54:10,351 --> 00:54:11,552
Only that person will gift wrap it..

432
00:54:11,619 --> 00:54:13,487
.. who has murdered her
at some other place..

433
00:54:13,554 --> 00:54:15,022
.. and dumped the body in the jungle.

434
00:54:16,357 --> 00:54:18,025
Because neither rape
has been attempted..

435
00:54:18,092 --> 00:54:19,293
.. nor robbery.

436
00:54:22,430 --> 00:54:25,700
There are no signs of
struggle on the body.

437
00:54:27,568 --> 00:54:29,036
Suicide.

438
00:54:30,438 --> 00:54:32,039
Sheila has committed suicide.

439
00:54:33,441 --> 00:54:36,510
She packed herself.
Came to the jungle.

440
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:40,114
She unpacked herself and
jumped in the water.

441
00:54:54,328 --> 00:54:57,231
Don't you think you're
smoking too much?

442
00:55:02,403 --> 00:55:04,071
Call up Tiwari and tell him that..

443
00:55:04,138 --> 00:55:06,073
.. the work won't be completed
till 2 o'clock.

444
00:55:07,341 --> 00:55:11,245
Tell him to come till
tomorrow morning.

445
00:55:24,358 --> 00:55:27,094
I'll tell! I'll tell!
I'll tell! Papa! Papa!

446
00:55:27,261 --> 00:55:29,263
Today Tejpal uncle had come.

447
00:55:32,433 --> 00:55:33,501
When did he come?

448
00:55:33,567 --> 00:55:35,102
When we returned from the school..

449
00:55:35,169 --> 00:55:37,438
.. he was in Banerjee uncle's house.

450
00:55:37,505 --> 00:55:39,573
Banerjee uncle brought him here.

451
00:55:40,708 --> 00:55:42,176
Did he ask anything from you?

452
00:55:42,376 --> 00:55:44,111
When had mummy gone to Shirdi?

453
00:55:44,178 --> 00:55:46,113
What was papa doing at that time?

454
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:48,115
Where does papa works?

455
00:55:51,285 --> 00:55:52,453
Anything else?

456
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:53,621
Nothing else.

457
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:02,129
Mini, did he ask anything from you?

458
00:56:02,196 --> 00:56:03,264
All this only.

459
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:07,301
And I told Tejpal uncle
that day I was sleeping.

460
00:56:07,401 --> 00:56:09,136
And I was afraid.

461
00:56:09,470 --> 00:56:10,604
Then?

462
00:56:10,671 --> 00:56:12,139
Then he went away.

463
00:56:13,474 --> 00:56:16,310
You didn't told him.. that
night I came late, did you?

464
00:56:16,477 --> 00:56:18,412
O no! I forgot.

465
00:56:35,428 --> 00:56:36,496
Hello.

466
00:56:36,563 --> 00:56:40,667
Hello, Ravi-ji. I'm Tejpal
speaking. Inspector Tejpal.

467
00:56:41,334 --> 00:56:44,637
Yes? - Just like that. Can
I meet you tomorrow?

468
00:56:45,505 --> 00:56:46,573
Why?

469
00:56:46,639 --> 00:56:47,707
Nothing special.

470
00:56:48,341 --> 00:56:51,177
Do one thing. Tomorrow
morning at 11 o'clock..

471
00:56:51,244 --> 00:56:53,179
.. no.. come at 10 o'clock.

472
00:56:53,446 --> 00:56:55,181
We'll have breakfast together.

473
00:56:56,349 --> 00:56:57,784
We'll talk about everything
then only.

474
00:56:57,851 --> 00:57:02,188
I.. - Tomorrow morning,
10 o'clock, breakfast.

475
00:57:08,728 --> 00:57:10,196
Fight?

476
00:57:10,363 --> 00:57:14,200
Between you and Sheila-ji. That's
your personal matter.

477
00:57:16,269 --> 00:57:18,605
Don't feel bad. I'm just
asking for the record.

478
00:57:19,472 --> 00:57:21,207
That's a common thing between
husband and wife.

479
00:57:23,476 --> 00:57:27,881
Yes. It's the story of each house.

480
00:57:28,381 --> 00:57:31,217
But your story has leaked
out of the house..

481
00:57:31,284 --> 00:57:33,219
.. and become very popular
amongst the neighbours.

482
00:57:35,488 --> 00:57:36,556
Don't mind.

483
00:57:41,494 --> 00:57:43,229
By the way, about what
things you both fought?

484
00:57:44,631 --> 00:57:47,233
About household things, about kids.

485
00:57:51,705 --> 00:57:53,640
Did you both beat each
other for kids?

486
00:57:55,508 --> 00:57:56,576
Don't hid anything.

487
00:57:57,510 --> 00:57:58,645
I'm not hiding anything.

488
00:58:02,649 --> 00:58:04,250
Your watchman was saying that..

489
00:58:04,317 --> 00:58:06,519
.. he didn't see Sheila going out.

490
00:58:08,655 --> 00:58:10,423
Maybe by chance he didn't see her.

491
00:58:19,432 --> 00:58:20,800
What was in the carton?

492
00:58:23,603 --> 00:58:24,671
Carton?

493
00:58:28,675 --> 00:58:30,276
On the day Sheila disappeared.

494
00:58:31,878 --> 00:58:34,280
My tapes, books..

495
00:58:34,547 --> 00:58:35,615
Which?

496
00:58:36,449 --> 00:58:37,550
About my studio.

497
00:58:38,618 --> 00:58:39,753
In such a big carton?

498
00:58:39,819 --> 00:58:41,287
There were plenty.

499
00:58:42,455 --> 00:58:43,790
Now where is the carton?

500
00:58:44,624 --> 00:58:45,759
In my studio.

501
00:58:45,825 --> 00:58:47,627
How did you carry the carton from
your house to the studio?

502
00:58:50,363 --> 00:58:51,498
In your bike?

503
00:58:52,465 --> 00:58:53,566
In the taxi.

504
00:58:53,633 --> 00:58:55,301
Taxi.. in taxi.

505
00:59:05,645 --> 00:59:07,313
You didn't even eat anything.

506
00:59:36,876 --> 00:59:41,347
Hello? Ravi sir. Hello?

507
00:59:42,415 --> 00:59:43,550
Hello.

508
00:59:43,817 --> 00:59:46,619
Hello, sir, when are you
coming to the studio?

509
00:59:46,686 --> 00:59:48,888
Reena, Reena I'm sorry, I forgot.

510
00:59:49,889 --> 00:59:52,759
I'm not too well.
I have a head ache.

511
00:59:52,859 --> 00:59:54,361
I'm sorry, sir.

512
00:59:55,528 --> 00:59:56,696
I'll call you later.

513
00:59:56,830 --> 00:59:58,631
Okay, sir. Take care.

514
01:00:06,639 --> 01:00:10,377
Hey, hi sexy. 8:30, Regent.
You do remember, don't you?

515
01:00:10,443 --> 01:00:12,912
Raj, there is loads of work
here. You go alone.

516
01:00:13,446 --> 01:00:15,382
Great! So now I'll call
Pooja and Ajay..

517
01:00:15,448 --> 01:00:17,984
.. and tell them that we're
not coming for dinner.

518
01:00:18,051 --> 01:00:20,387
Come on, my friend. We have been
planning this for 4 days.

519
01:00:20,553 --> 01:00:23,390
Seriously, Raj. Even Ravi sir
has not come today and..

520
01:00:23,456 --> 01:00:26,593
But..
- Raj, try to understand, please.

521
01:00:26,659 --> 01:00:28,395
Okay! Okay!

522
01:00:44,878 --> 01:00:45,945
Enough.

523
01:00:58,591 --> 01:01:00,427
You've already finished.
- It's delicious.

524
01:01:00,493 --> 01:01:01,695
Then have some more.

525
01:01:01,761 --> 01:01:02,829
No.

526
01:01:02,896 --> 01:01:04,898
Did you again eat some
junk food from outside?

527
01:01:05,832 --> 01:01:07,634
I only eat the food cooked by you.

528
01:01:07,834 --> 01:01:09,769
I don't like eating outside food.

529
01:01:09,903 --> 01:01:11,438
Then have some more.

530
01:01:12,605 --> 01:01:13,707
I'm full.

531
01:01:14,607 --> 01:01:15,975
Don't give me excuses.

532
01:01:16,609 --> 01:01:17,877
I'm not making any excuses.

533
01:01:19,779 --> 01:01:21,915
The food was good, I'm full.

534
01:01:22,849 --> 01:01:25,785
If you liked the food, then why
aren't you having some more?

535
01:01:25,852 --> 01:01:28,788
It is a human's stomach.
I'm not an animal.

536
01:01:28,955 --> 01:01:32,859
You mean to say that my food
is fit for an animal.

537
01:01:34,627 --> 01:01:35,795
Talking to you..

538
01:01:35,862 --> 01:01:37,464
Then why do you talk to me?

539
01:01:38,798 --> 01:01:40,800
It was my father who promoted you.

540
01:01:41,735 --> 01:01:43,470
Otherwise you would
still have been..

541
01:01:43,536 --> 01:01:45,472
.. in Agripada as a sub inspector.

542
01:01:47,741 --> 01:01:49,476
Don't remind me about your
father's authority..

543
01:01:49,542 --> 01:01:51,478
.. in each and everything.
- I will do it.

544
01:02:01,821 --> 01:02:04,157
Hello. Yes, Wagle, tell me.

545
01:02:05,658 --> 01:02:06,960
What is there to disturb me about?

546
01:02:07,994 --> 01:02:10,663
I was having dinner.. with
my wife peacefully.

547
01:02:13,033 --> 01:02:14,100
When?

548
01:02:25,678 --> 01:02:27,580
If you had work, then you
should have told me before.

549
01:02:27,681 --> 01:02:28,848
I wouldn't have promised my friends.

550
01:02:29,849 --> 01:02:34,521
Raj, because of Sheila's death,
Ravi sir is disturbed.

551
01:02:35,121 --> 01:02:38,525
That's why I have to handle
all the studio work.

552
01:02:39,793 --> 01:02:42,862
He must be happy. Now there
is no one to doubt him.

553
01:02:43,797 --> 01:02:44,931
What?

554
01:02:44,998 --> 01:02:47,000
Nothing.
- What did you say?

555
01:02:47,067 --> 01:02:48,535
What you heard.

556
01:02:48,702 --> 01:02:51,938
Don't be an idiot, Raj. Try to
understand other's problems.

557
01:03:02,949 --> 01:03:04,017
Hello.

558
01:03:04,084 --> 01:03:05,885
Mr. Patwardhan.
- Yes.

559
01:03:06,052 --> 01:03:08,555
There is good news, regarding
your wife's case.

560
01:03:10,890 --> 01:03:13,560
You people think that we
policemen don't work.

561
01:03:13,727 --> 01:03:15,562
But, look, so soon we've found out..

562
01:03:15,628 --> 01:03:17,163
.. who was involved in the murder.

563
01:03:17,831 --> 01:03:18,898
I don't understand.

564
01:03:19,966 --> 01:03:23,236
I'll make you understand. Let
me tell you the whole thing.

565
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:25,972
Tell me the whole thing.

566
01:03:26,906 --> 01:03:28,575
I'll tell you. Why are you
getting so restless?

567
01:03:29,976 --> 01:03:32,579
I'm not restless.

568
01:03:32,746 --> 01:03:34,581
It means you're not eager to know..

569
01:03:34,647 --> 01:03:36,049
.. about your wife's murderer?

570
01:03:36,116 --> 01:03:38,084
Look, I'm busy..

571
01:03:38,151 --> 01:03:41,588
Blue Tata Indigo, number
MH-04-C-9636..

572
01:03:41,654 --> 01:03:44,924
.. was spotted in the jungle.

573
01:03:45,992 --> 01:03:48,862
Now very soon we'll found out
who is your wife's murderer.

574
01:04:04,144 --> 01:04:05,612
Good news, sir.

575
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:07,614
Tiwari has finally sent the cheque.

576
01:04:07,781 --> 01:04:09,616
And the footage of the
next talk show too.

577
01:04:17,023 --> 01:04:18,892
Reena, I want to talk
to you about something.

578
01:04:22,896 --> 01:04:23,963
What happened?

579
01:04:26,032 --> 01:04:30,637
If I say that I don't want
any harm to come to you..

580
01:04:30,704 --> 01:04:35,241
.. because of me, then
will you believe me?

581
01:04:35,809 --> 01:04:36,976
Of course, sir.

582
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:41,648
You know that.. but.. why are
talking about all these things?

583
01:04:42,048 --> 01:04:43,650
Because something has happened..

584
01:04:43,717 --> 01:04:45,985
.. due to which you might
get into trouble.

585
01:04:47,821 --> 01:04:48,988
What's the matter?

586
01:04:49,255 --> 01:04:53,660
Sheila.. was never missing.

587
01:04:55,862 --> 01:04:56,996
We had a fight and..

588
01:05:38,038 --> 01:05:40,206
I got frightened thinking
about Mini and Karan.

589
01:05:41,875 --> 01:05:43,877
That if I get imprisoned then
who will take care of them.

590
01:05:45,045 --> 01:05:46,713
When I asked for your car..

591
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:49,983
.. I thought that no one
would come to know.

592
01:05:51,051 --> 01:05:53,920
But police has traced
your car's number.

593
01:05:54,988 --> 01:05:56,723
You tell them the truth, Reena.

594
01:05:57,323 --> 01:05:59,192
So that no harm comes to you.

595
01:06:00,126 --> 01:06:02,896
I'm sorry, Reena. Please..

596
01:06:38,231 --> 01:06:40,934
I had to record some
sound of the jungle.

597
01:06:41,167 --> 01:06:44,037
The trees, winds.. owls.

598
01:06:45,171 --> 01:06:46,773
This place is closest from here.

599
01:06:47,107 --> 01:06:48,775
So I went there.

600
01:06:52,178 --> 01:06:53,780
So late at night?

601
01:06:54,948 --> 01:06:57,784
Weren't you afraid, in the
jungle that too alone?

602
01:06:58,118 --> 01:07:00,120
Now when I have to work then what
is there to be afraid of?

603
01:07:00,787 --> 01:07:02,055
Can we see your car?

604
01:07:02,188 --> 01:07:04,791
Sure. But it has gone for servicing.

605
01:07:06,793 --> 01:07:10,797
Police has found a dead body.
In that jungle, in the water.

606
01:07:13,199 --> 01:07:15,201
Did you see anything?
Or hear anything?

607
01:07:16,269 --> 01:07:17,337
No.

608
01:07:18,304 --> 01:07:20,407
Your husband is not here?

609
01:07:21,307 --> 01:07:23,410
No, we're not married.

610
01:07:24,310 --> 01:07:25,812
Where does he stay?

611
01:07:26,279 --> 01:07:27,347
Here.

612
01:07:31,418 --> 01:07:33,353
So now what's left
to get married for?

613
01:07:38,491 --> 01:07:40,827
No, I thought you both
are staying together.

614
01:07:40,894 --> 01:07:42,896
Posing in the photographs with
big smile on your face.

615
01:07:43,029 --> 01:07:47,834
You both are happy. Marriage is
just a formality, isn't it so?

616
01:07:51,004 --> 01:07:52,238
Let's make a move.

617
01:08:09,189 --> 01:08:10,857
Can you come to the studio?

618
01:08:12,125 --> 01:08:13,860
Okay. See you.

619
01:08:14,027 --> 01:08:15,195
What happened?

620
01:08:16,363 --> 01:08:17,464
Nothing.

621
01:08:18,131 --> 01:08:20,066
What were the policemen doing here?

622
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:21,868
Yes.. that..

623
01:08:21,935 --> 01:08:25,872
.. there was an accident case
of some Blue Indigo car.

624
01:08:25,939 --> 01:08:27,874
They were investigating about that.

625
01:08:29,142 --> 01:08:31,411
They don't have the number.

626
01:08:31,478 --> 01:08:33,546
That's why they are checking
everyone's Indigo car.

627
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:35,882
All Blue Indigos?

628
01:08:36,049 --> 01:08:38,885
Yes. You have a seat. I'm going
out for some work. Okay.

629
01:08:38,952 --> 01:08:40,153
Where?
- Studio.

630
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:41,287
Now?

631
01:08:41,354 --> 01:08:42,489
Yes, I have some urgent work.

632
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:08,181
Hi.

633
01:09:11,184 --> 01:09:13,920
I'd told you that police have
found out about a car.

634
01:09:15,255 --> 01:09:16,923
It's some Reena Wadva's car.

635
01:09:18,191 --> 01:09:19,259
Who had gone that night..

636
01:09:19,325 --> 01:09:20,927
.. to the jungle to
record some sounds.

637
01:09:23,196 --> 01:09:24,264
Let it be.

638
01:09:27,333 --> 01:09:29,936
What carton was that? Can I come in?

639
01:09:37,277 --> 01:09:38,478
What carton was that in which..

640
01:09:38,545 --> 01:09:39,946
.. you had brought the
tapes and books?

641
01:09:40,547 --> 01:09:42,415
I wanted to see whether it matches..

642
01:09:42,482 --> 01:09:44,150
.. with what your neighbour had said.

643
01:09:49,356 --> 01:09:52,559
It's not that I don't have
faith in you. Duty.

644
01:10:04,371 --> 01:10:05,972
Nice place. Very nice.

645
01:10:10,377 --> 01:10:11,478
What is editing?

646
01:10:16,449 --> 01:10:18,985
Joining the different parts
of the movie correctly.

647
01:10:19,052 --> 01:10:21,988
And removing those parts
that are not required.

648
01:10:26,393 --> 01:10:28,995
That means you keep what
you want to show and..

649
01:10:29,062 --> 01:10:32,999
.. what you don't want to show,
you cut and throw it away.

650
01:10:34,334 --> 01:10:37,003
That's very interesting. Very nice.

651
01:10:49,482 --> 01:10:50,550
Move it ahead.

652
01:11:02,529 --> 01:11:05,632
Ravi-ji, good night.
Don't work so hard.

653
01:11:23,383 --> 01:11:24,551
Why did you lie to the police?

654
01:11:25,318 --> 01:11:27,253
That you had taken the car
that night to the jungle.

655
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:29,556
I did what I thought was right.

656
01:11:31,558 --> 01:11:33,059
That's a murder case.

657
01:11:33,226 --> 01:11:34,394
Excuse me, would you like
to place the order?

658
01:11:34,461 --> 01:11:35,562
Just give us a minute, please.

659
01:11:38,732 --> 01:11:40,066
I know, sir.

660
01:11:40,467 --> 01:11:41,601
But you could have been imprisoned..

661
01:11:41,668 --> 01:11:43,236
.. if I'd told them the truth.

662
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:45,271
That too because of a mistake.

663
01:11:45,338 --> 01:11:48,074
Reena, police might make
out some wrong meaning..

664
01:11:48,141 --> 01:11:50,343
.. of your car being there.

665
01:11:51,411 --> 01:11:53,079
You should have told them the truth.

666
01:11:53,613 --> 01:11:55,682
It shouldn't be that because of me..

667
01:11:55,749 --> 01:11:59,085
You can be worried for me. But
I can't be worried for you?

668
01:12:00,687 --> 01:12:05,258
I believe you, sir. I
know there is a risk.

669
01:12:05,558 --> 01:12:08,094
But should I have done nothing?

670
01:12:08,428 --> 01:12:10,263
When I know the truth.

671
01:12:14,267 --> 01:12:16,102
I couldn't do that, sir.

672
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:29,282
I've given the car for servicing.

673
01:12:30,517 --> 01:12:32,652
In case there are some marks,
fingerprints.

674
01:12:33,653 --> 01:12:35,588
Whatever there is, it
will get washed away.

675
01:12:39,526 --> 01:12:40,660
Excuse me.

676
01:12:48,468 --> 01:12:50,136
Reena, what you did for me today..

677
01:12:50,203 --> 01:12:52,138
.. maybe even I wouldn't have been..

678
01:12:52,205 --> 01:12:54,341
.. able to do that for anyone.

679
01:12:54,407 --> 01:12:56,142
Even you would have
done the same thing.

680
01:13:13,693 --> 01:13:15,161
You've not gone to sleep.

681
01:13:16,229 --> 01:13:17,430
I was waiting for you.

682
01:13:17,497 --> 01:13:19,766
Here? In the darkness.
You frightened me.

683
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:22,335
From when did you started
getting afraid?

684
01:13:23,336 --> 01:13:24,437
What?

685
01:13:25,505 --> 01:13:26,573
Nothing.

686
01:13:29,642 --> 01:13:31,177
Your studio work got over?

687
01:13:31,444 --> 01:13:34,647
Yes. I had to go to
collect some tapes.

688
01:13:38,651 --> 01:13:41,321
It's quite a hard work, isn't it so?

689
01:13:42,355 --> 01:13:43,523
Yes.

690
01:14:22,562 --> 01:14:23,630
Just look at this.

691
01:14:23,697 --> 01:14:26,733
I have to disturb you for
asking small things.

692
01:14:27,767 --> 01:14:28,835
It's okay.

693
01:14:30,503 --> 01:14:31,638
Where do you work?

694
01:14:37,644 --> 01:14:40,714
I'm a free lancer. I don't work
with any particular person.

695
01:14:45,652 --> 01:14:49,255
How long will this go on,
Reena. One day they..

696
01:14:49,322 --> 01:14:51,424
They will come to know
the truth. Isn't it so?

697
01:14:51,591 --> 01:14:53,526
So why don't you agree
to what I'm saying.

698
01:14:54,728 --> 01:14:55,862
This can't happen.

699
01:14:55,929 --> 01:14:58,264
Please, for once think coolly.

700
01:14:58,331 --> 01:15:00,266
What do I think? Don't
talk childish things.

701
01:15:00,433 --> 01:15:02,736
If police comes to know that
we both work together.

702
01:15:02,802 --> 01:15:05,472
Or if someone tells them,
then it's a dead end.

703
01:15:05,672 --> 01:15:07,273
They'll surely be able
to reach to us.

704
01:15:09,743 --> 01:15:11,277
I should surrender myself.

705
01:15:11,745 --> 01:15:12,879
Because of me, even you're..

706
01:15:12,946 --> 01:15:14,614
.. getting trapped in
this marshy stuff.

707
01:15:15,682 --> 01:15:17,283
You want to save me, don't you?

708
01:15:17,450 --> 01:15:20,286
Then first save yourself. Please,
just get away from here.

709
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:23,823
At least I'll get some time.
I'll talk to daddy.

710
01:15:23,890 --> 01:15:26,292
He has lots of contacts. I'm
sure he can do something.

711
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:29,496
You just get away from here. Today.

712
01:15:29,763 --> 01:15:32,465
Where to go? What to do? We'll
think about that later.

713
01:15:37,704 --> 01:15:39,305
Where will I go running
away from here?

714
01:15:50,483 --> 01:15:52,318
No one saw the body in the carton?

715
01:15:55,588 --> 01:15:56,723
Getting wrapped.

716
01:15:58,925 --> 01:16:00,660
Even Sheila's parents
are siding with Ravi.

717
01:16:01,494 --> 01:16:02,662
Make it spicier.

718
01:16:04,664 --> 01:16:06,333
We know that we don't
have the proof.

719
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:08,735
But the one who has done the
murder doesn't know this.

720
01:16:10,737 --> 01:16:12,505
That person will definitely
make a mistake out of fear.

721
01:16:59,552 --> 01:17:00,720
Reena.

722
01:17:03,857 --> 01:17:05,392
Can I ask you one thing?

723
01:17:08,795 --> 01:17:10,997
If you want to break this
relationship, then tell me.

724
01:17:12,866 --> 01:17:13,933
Come on, Raj.

725
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,869
No, if you like some other person.

726
01:17:15,935 --> 01:17:18,938
Or whatever the reason
might be. Just tell me.

727
01:17:19,806 --> 01:17:20,940
This is not so, Raj.

728
01:17:21,007 --> 01:17:22,809
Just tell me once. I'll
go away from here.

729
01:17:22,909 --> 01:17:24,411
This is not so, Raj.

730
01:17:24,477 --> 01:17:26,680
Then why don't you tell me
what has happened to you?

731
01:17:30,583 --> 01:17:34,621
I'm sorry. You know
I love you, baby.

732
01:17:34,921 --> 01:17:37,424
I love you so God damn much.

733
01:17:38,591 --> 01:17:39,693
I love you too, Raj.

734
01:17:39,759 --> 01:17:41,428
No, you don't!

735
01:17:47,901 --> 01:17:57,043
Raj.. promise me. You won't
say anyone about this thing.

736
01:18:01,848 --> 01:18:04,451
Ravi sir is in big trouble.

737
01:18:08,621 --> 01:18:09,956
Papa, why are we going?

738
01:18:10,957 --> 01:18:14,661
I've got some work. It will
take quite a few days.

739
01:18:14,728 --> 01:18:16,796
That's why I'm taking
you both along with me.

740
01:18:17,063 --> 01:18:18,932
Papa, when will we come back?

741
01:18:21,801 --> 01:18:23,470
In a few days, dear.

742
01:18:31,011 --> 01:18:32,979
How did you make such
a big foolish mistake?

743
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:36,082
I just wanted to help Ravi sir, Raj.

744
01:18:36,750 --> 01:18:38,952
He has committed a murder.
Do you understand?

745
01:18:39,085 --> 01:18:40,754
Not murder, accident.

746
01:18:40,887 --> 01:18:41,955
And I know how much guilty..

747
01:18:42,022 --> 01:18:43,690
.. Ravi sir is feeling
because of this.

748
01:18:44,491 --> 01:18:46,826
He's using you. To save himself.

749
01:18:46,893 --> 01:18:50,063
Raj, I lied to the police
on my own will.

750
01:18:50,130 --> 01:18:51,498
Ravi didn't tell me to do it.

751
01:18:51,564 --> 01:18:53,533
In fact Ravi had told
me to speak the truth.

752
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:55,168
He knows!

753
01:18:55,669 --> 01:18:57,003
The more sympathy he gets by lying..

754
01:18:57,070 --> 01:18:58,505
.. that much more you'll help him.

755
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:02,842
It's dangerous. That rascal..

756
01:19:02,909 --> 01:19:04,844
Raj!

757
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:08,815
You're involved in a murder case.

758
01:19:08,882 --> 01:19:10,517
Don't keep saying murder, murder.

759
01:19:10,583 --> 01:19:11,751
It was an accident, Raj.

760
01:19:14,754 --> 01:19:16,022
You call up the police.

761
01:19:16,089 --> 01:19:17,924
Let them decide whether it was
a murder or an accident.

762
01:19:17,991 --> 01:19:20,026
Raj, why don't you
try to understand?

763
01:19:20,860 --> 01:19:22,696
If this had been an accident,
then he wouldn't have..

764
01:19:22,762 --> 01:19:25,198
.. dumped Sheila's
body in the jungle.

765
01:19:25,265 --> 01:19:27,934
I can't explain the same
thing ten times to you.

766
01:19:28,001 --> 01:19:29,869
When the police will come,
after he runs away..

767
01:19:29,936 --> 01:19:31,538
.. this is what you'll say to them.
That you can't explain.

768
01:19:31,604 --> 01:19:33,139
Raj, I've had enough of this, okay!

769
01:19:33,873 --> 01:19:36,209
Please let me handle my
problems by myself.

770
01:19:36,276 --> 01:19:37,711
It's the matter of only few hours.

771
01:19:37,777 --> 01:19:39,546
Once Ravi sir gets away from here..

772
01:19:39,612 --> 01:19:41,548
.. then I'll think about myself.

773
01:19:44,718 --> 01:19:46,553
You've gone mad!

774
01:20:34,668 --> 01:20:36,603
Don't sleep with the
pillow on your face.

775
01:20:36,670 --> 01:20:38,104
How many times I've told you.

776
01:20:38,171 --> 01:20:40,206
Don't give residential number
for official work.

777
01:20:40,607 --> 01:20:44,010
What happened?
- Go, there's some Raj on the line.

778
01:20:44,077 --> 01:20:46,946
Raj? Who Raj?

779
01:21:08,134 --> 01:21:09,636
Of course Reena told me, sir.

780
01:21:09,703 --> 01:21:10,970
Sir, if you waste your time
on the phone only..

781
01:21:11,037 --> 01:21:12,639
.. then Ravi will run away.

782
01:21:12,706 --> 01:21:14,641
You come and convince Reena.

783
01:21:14,708 --> 01:21:16,142
She'll give you the statement.

784
01:21:16,209 --> 01:21:17,677
Mr. Tejpal..

785
01:21:19,646 --> 01:21:20,980
You... I trusted you!

786
01:21:21,047 --> 01:21:22,315
That's why I'm trying to help you.

787
01:21:22,382 --> 01:21:24,651
Help! To hell with
you and your help.

788
01:21:24,718 --> 01:21:26,820
If you have some brains,
then try to understand.

789
01:21:26,886 --> 01:21:29,923
With so much difficulties..
you spoiled everything.

790
01:21:29,990 --> 01:21:32,993
I spoilt it! I spoilt
it or you did it!

791
01:21:33,059 --> 01:21:35,161
Idiot! You lied to the police!

792
01:21:35,228 --> 01:21:38,131
If you don't have any common sense,
then listen to others.

793
01:21:38,198 --> 01:21:41,001
I don't want to listen to your
nonsense a second longer.

794
01:21:41,668 --> 01:21:42,836
That same Raj whose photo..

795
01:21:42,902 --> 01:21:44,337
.. we had seen in Reena's
house that day.

796
01:21:44,404 --> 01:21:46,272
The call got disconnected.

797
01:21:47,841 --> 01:21:49,342
Wagle, you go to Reena's place.

798
01:21:49,843 --> 01:21:52,012
I'll go to Ravi's house.

799
01:21:53,013 --> 01:21:55,682
It's none of your business.
- Where are you going?

800
01:21:55,749 --> 01:21:57,183
I gave some work.

801
01:21:57,250 --> 01:21:59,352
I know your work. You're
going to tell Ravi.

802
01:22:00,854 --> 01:22:02,022
Raj, let me go!

803
01:22:02,088 --> 01:22:03,356
You're not going anywhere.

804
01:22:03,423 --> 01:22:04,691
Otherwise, again you'll
go to help Ravi..

805
01:22:04,758 --> 01:22:07,193
.. and the police will blame you.

806
01:22:10,030 --> 01:22:13,867
Reena.. Reena..

807
01:22:16,703 --> 01:22:18,038
Are you listening
to what I'm saying?

808
01:22:22,042 --> 01:22:23,710
You're not going anywhere.
- Leave my hand.

809
01:22:23,777 --> 01:22:25,311
Sit here quietly! Understood!

810
01:22:27,881 --> 01:22:29,215
You!

811
01:22:31,885 --> 01:22:33,053
You hit me!

812
01:24:07,814 --> 01:24:11,818
Ravi sir didn't do anything.
I'm saying the truth.

813
01:24:11,885 --> 01:24:14,321
That day Sheila's leg slipped..

814
01:24:14,387 --> 01:24:17,490
.. and her head banged with the bed.

815
01:24:17,991 --> 01:24:19,426
And you both thought that..

816
01:24:19,492 --> 01:24:22,495
.. police will consider
it as a murder.

817
01:24:23,997 --> 01:24:25,498
Not accident.

818
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:35,508
This is not so, Reena.

819
01:24:36,009 --> 01:24:38,345
Ravi is a nice man.

820
01:24:38,511 --> 01:24:41,514
Even Sheila's parents like
Ravi more than Sheila.

821
01:24:45,352 --> 01:24:47,520
You both made a very big mistake.

822
01:24:49,356 --> 01:24:52,859
Running away is like
committing suicide.

823
01:24:56,529 --> 01:24:58,098
Where did he go, Reena?

824
01:24:59,032 --> 01:25:00,533
I don't know, sir.

825
01:25:01,868 --> 01:25:04,037
Reena, I've got seniors above me.

826
01:25:05,138 --> 01:25:08,208
They can put all the police
force behind Ravi.

827
01:25:09,042 --> 01:25:11,544
If police from other
states got involved..

828
01:25:11,611 --> 01:25:13,046
.. then even after knowing
everything..

829
01:25:13,113 --> 01:25:15,048
.. I won't be able to help him.

830
01:25:18,118 --> 01:25:22,389
Ravi sir was saying that he
has a cousin in Mangalore.

831
01:25:23,390 --> 01:25:25,225
Who can help him out.

832
01:25:43,243 --> 01:25:46,246
What do you think? That
police eats grass.

833
01:25:48,081 --> 01:25:49,916
You both together murdered Sheila.

834
01:25:49,983 --> 01:25:51,484
And helped Ravi to run away.

835
01:25:51,551 --> 01:25:53,153
And the condition of poor Raj..

836
01:25:53,219 --> 01:25:55,255
.. that's an attempt to murder case.

837
01:25:55,322 --> 01:25:56,923
Come on, Wagle.
Thanks for the information.

838
01:26:18,111 --> 01:26:19,579
Where are we going, papa?

839
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:22,282
Mangalore.

840
01:26:23,950 --> 01:26:25,285
Come on, Karan.

841
01:26:28,121 --> 01:26:30,323
Sorry.
- It's okay.

842
01:26:39,132 --> 01:26:43,203
Look, come here. Is there any
decent thing to eat today?

843
01:26:43,269 --> 01:26:45,972
Potato peas, spicy chicken
and fenugreeks' vegetable.

844
01:26:46,039 --> 01:26:47,407
The same old stuff.

845
01:26:47,474 --> 01:26:49,976
Do one thing. Get an
omelette of two eggs.

846
01:26:50,043 --> 01:26:52,645
Put some onion on the top.
And make it spicy.

847
01:26:52,712 --> 01:26:54,314
Okay, sir.
- Go.

848
01:27:38,191 --> 01:27:40,026
Sheikh sir, you! Just now
you'd finished your duty.

849
01:27:40,093 --> 01:27:42,028
Now what has happened?
- Is inspector sir here?

850
01:27:42,095 --> 01:27:43,363
No, he has already left.

851
01:27:46,032 --> 01:27:49,202
Where's the fax that had come
in the morning from Mumbai?

852
01:27:49,269 --> 01:27:50,637
It was lying somewhere
here only, sir.

853
01:28:22,068 --> 01:28:23,403
What happened, sir?

854
01:28:29,242 --> 01:28:30,410
What happened?

855
01:28:32,078 --> 01:28:33,580
This man.. he was in this
bus only, wasn't he?

856
01:28:33,647 --> 01:28:35,415
He got down.
- When?

857
01:28:35,482 --> 01:28:38,418
Some half an hour back. His
daughter wasn't feeling well.

858
01:28:59,272 --> 01:29:02,275
Karan, now Mini is fine.

859
01:29:02,342 --> 01:29:04,110
I miss mummy.

860
01:29:13,453 --> 01:29:15,288
Do you want water?

861
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:22,729
I'll get something to eat.

862
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:42,649
Chandresh, get milk for sir.

863
01:29:43,316 --> 01:29:45,151
What happened to the child?

864
01:29:45,218 --> 01:29:48,321
Food poisoning. Suddenly
her stomach got upset.

865
01:29:51,491 --> 01:29:53,593
What will I take for so little milk?

866
01:29:53,660 --> 01:29:55,328
Thank you.

867
01:29:55,395 --> 01:29:57,497
Sir, someone has come to meet you.

868
01:29:57,564 --> 01:29:59,165
Now who has come?

869
01:30:55,221 --> 01:30:56,556
Where are we going, papa?

870
01:32:04,624 --> 01:32:07,794
Papa, where are we going in
the hotel's owner's car?

871
01:32:09,462 --> 01:32:11,798
We're taking Mini to the doctor.

872
01:32:12,465 --> 01:32:15,468
But papa, uncle's all
the cans are with us.

873
01:32:16,469 --> 01:32:18,972
I know, Karan. You just sit quietly.

874
01:33:10,523 --> 01:33:12,359
One minute, one minute.

875
01:33:12,425 --> 01:33:14,694
One minute.. did you get hurt?

876
01:33:17,530 --> 01:33:21,034
Karan.. Karan! Come..
come on. Come.

877
01:33:26,539 --> 01:33:32,712
Come on. Run, come on, run.

878
01:33:38,718 --> 01:33:41,388
Run, come on, run.

879
01:34:25,432 --> 01:34:29,936
Papa.. papa.. why are we running?

880
01:35:06,473 --> 01:35:07,807
Karan.

881
01:35:07,874 --> 01:35:11,978
I won't come with you. You're
a liar. I won't come with you.

882
01:35:12,812 --> 01:35:15,649
What happened? Let's go from here.

883
01:35:15,815 --> 01:35:17,517
You're lying.

884
01:35:17,584 --> 01:35:19,719
You're not going to the doctor.

885
01:35:19,786 --> 01:35:21,821
And you're also not
going to Mangalore.

886
01:35:21,888 --> 01:35:23,890
I'll tell you everything
later. Come on now.

887
01:35:23,957 --> 01:35:25,558
Leave me, leave me.
- Come on, Karan.

888
01:35:25,625 --> 01:35:26,993
I said leave me.

889
01:35:27,060 --> 01:35:28,828
Karan, come. Otherwise
I'll slap you.

890
01:35:28,895 --> 01:35:30,830
Leave me.

891
01:35:36,836 --> 01:35:38,838
I won't come with you, leave me.

892
01:35:42,676 --> 01:35:44,678
Karan.. Karan..

893
01:35:46,846 --> 01:35:48,848
O God! Karan..

894
01:36:24,718 --> 01:36:26,553
Papa, please let's go home.

895
01:36:42,902 --> 01:36:45,739
Hey! Can't you see!

896
01:36:45,805 --> 01:36:47,574
These are only kids!

897
01:36:47,641 --> 01:36:49,242
Go and nab him.

898
01:36:55,749 --> 01:36:57,584
Papa.. papa..

899
01:36:57,651 --> 01:36:59,586
Leave me.

900
01:36:59,653 --> 01:37:01,087
Papa..

901
01:37:01,154 --> 01:37:03,089
One minute, leave me.
- Take him away.

902
01:37:03,156 --> 01:37:04,257
Papa.. papa..

903
01:37:04,324 --> 01:37:05,792
One minute, leave me.

904
01:37:05,859 --> 01:37:07,594
Papa.. papa..

905
01:37:07,661 --> 01:37:09,696
Sir, sir, let me speak to my kids.

906
01:37:09,763 --> 01:37:11,264
Please, papa..
- Please, sir.

907
01:37:11,331 --> 01:37:12,599
Papa.. papa..

908
01:37:12,666 --> 01:37:14,601
Whatever you want to say, say
it in the police station.

909
01:37:14,668 --> 01:37:17,270
Papa.. papa..
- Sir, sir.. please.

910
01:37:17,337 --> 01:37:18,605
Papa.. papa.. papa..
- Please, sir.

911
01:37:18,672 --> 01:37:21,274
Papa.. papa.. papa..

912
01:37:21,341 --> 01:37:22,609
Sir, sir.. please.

913
01:37:22,676 --> 01:37:24,944
Sir.. sir.. please.

914
01:37:25,011 --> 01:37:26,613
Sir.. please, sir.

915
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:28,648
Papa.. papa.. papa..

916
01:37:28,715 --> 01:37:32,185
I had lied to both of you that
mummy had gone to Shirdi!

917
01:37:33,620 --> 01:37:34,954
Papa..

918
01:37:35,021 --> 01:37:39,125
We had a fight. I slapped
her and she died.

919
01:37:40,794 --> 01:37:44,964
I didn't purposely kill her. I
want to stay with both of you!

920
01:37:45,031 --> 01:37:48,301
Believe me, believe me!

921
01:37:48,368 --> 01:37:52,305
I don't want to go to jail. I
want to stay with both of you.

922
01:37:52,973 --> 01:37:55,642
It was an accident!

923
01:37:56,810 --> 01:38:01,281
I don't want to go to jail. I
want to stay with both of you.

924
01:38:01,348 --> 01:38:05,151
Believe me. It was an accident.

925
01:38:10,991 --> 01:38:20,133
Karan, Mini. I'm Tejpal uncle.
Want to come with me?

926
01:38:23,837 --> 01:38:25,338
Come on.

927
01:38:47,694 --> 01:38:49,195
A letter for you.

928
01:39:52,926 --> 01:39:55,762
'With further investigation,
I and Wagle..

929
01:39:55,829 --> 01:39:59,099
.. got assured that Ravi did not
intentionally kill Sheila. '

930
01:39:59,933 --> 01:40:02,769
'We said the same thing
in front of the judge. '

931
01:40:02,836 --> 01:40:04,771
'And Ravi got the bail. '

932
01:40:06,106 --> 01:40:08,108
'Now he is with Mini and Karan. '

933
01:40:09,009 --> 01:40:10,777
'Let's see what happens further. '

934
01:40:11,111 --> 01:40:12,779
'I'm hopeful that Ravi will be..

935
01:40:12,846 --> 01:40:14,447
.. imprisoned only for a few years. '

936
01:40:14,514 --> 01:40:16,282
'I've come to know that
Raj and Reena..

937
01:40:16,349 --> 01:40:18,785
.. have got back together
once again. '

938
01:40:19,119 --> 01:40:22,789
'Even we understand that
sometimes a person..

939
01:40:22,856 --> 01:40:25,792
.. makes one mistake and
he repeatedly keeps on..

940
01:40:25,859 --> 01:40:28,461
.. making mistakes to hide
that one mistake. '
