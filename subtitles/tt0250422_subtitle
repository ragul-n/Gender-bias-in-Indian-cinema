1
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,020
Mister foreman,
have you arrived at a verdict?

2
00:02:07,278 --> 00:02:08,358
We have, your honour.

3
00:02:08,571 --> 00:02:12,320
We find the defendant
guilty of all charges.

4
00:02:22,377 --> 00:02:24,749
- He has no priors-
- That's misleading.

5
00:02:24,963 --> 00:02:26,078
He has no convictions.

6
00:02:26,298 --> 00:02:29,252
- Is he dangerous?
- No, but he's a slippery little shit.

7
00:02:29,468 --> 00:02:31,591
Your honour,
request bail be continued-

8
00:02:31,804 --> 00:02:35,469
He's already wasted the jury's time,
not to mention yours.

9
00:02:35,683 --> 00:02:38,933
- He has no priors, your honour.
- Judge, lock him in now.

10
00:02:39,144 --> 00:02:41,718
No, your honour.
He's a very decent family man.

11
00:02:41,981 --> 00:02:44,269
But he has no priors.
He has no convictions.

12
00:02:44,525 --> 00:02:46,814
I don't care about the pri-
Misleading?

13
00:02:47,027 --> 00:02:49,519
- Is he violent?
- He wouldn't hurt a flea.

14
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:52,230
- I mean, a fly.
- You're very naive.

15
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:53,860
I'm not naive!

16
00:02:54,076 --> 00:02:55,535
That's enough of this.

17
00:02:55,786 --> 00:02:58,408
All right, I'm going with you.

18
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:01,952
I got your bail continued.

19
00:03:02,168 --> 00:03:04,077
I don't want my bail continued.

20
00:03:04,295 --> 00:03:06,537
Mr. LaPlante, they found you guilty.

21
00:03:06,798 --> 00:03:08,209
Guilty? What do you mean?

22
00:03:08,424 --> 00:03:10,500
The jury found you guilty.

23
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,753
I'm innocent, for chrissake!

24
00:03:12,971 --> 00:03:17,597
Mr. LaPlante, I've been persuaded,
in view of your continued employment...

25
00:03:17,809 --> 00:03:19,517
...and your lack of priors...

26
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:23,055
...to continue your bail
under the same conditions...

27
00:03:23,315 --> 00:03:26,434
...pending sentencing six days from now.

28
00:03:26,651 --> 00:03:30,151
In the meantime, make an appointment
with a probation officer...

29
00:03:30,405 --> 00:03:33,774
...who will make a recommendation to me
regarding your sentence.

30
00:03:34,576 --> 00:03:35,987
I urge you...

31
00:03:36,244 --> 00:03:40,990
...to use those six days to get
your personal affairs in order...

32
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,334
...in anticipation of incarceration.

33
00:03:47,047 --> 00:03:51,425
In anticipation of incarceration.

34
00:03:51,927 --> 00:03:53,920
" In anticipation of incarceration. "

35
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,971
He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.

36
00:03:56,182 --> 00:03:59,764
I know what he means. I'm not
a prison kind of guy, Miss O'Day.

37
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:04,313
You're not doing your job. Last time
my lawyer got the charges dismissed.

38
00:04:04,565 --> 00:04:07,650
That's why the district attorney
is so hard-nosed this time.

39
00:04:07,902 --> 00:04:09,941
- An appeal?
- We don't have the grounds.

40
00:04:10,196 --> 00:04:13,897
What we have to do is focus
on the probation officer's report.

41
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:16,234
He gives a good report and I walk?

42
00:04:16,452 --> 00:04:19,952
I think a suspended sentence
is unlikely. Now...

43
00:04:20,665 --> 00:04:23,073
You still have your job, right?

44
00:04:23,293 --> 00:04:25,166
I've been calling in sick.

45
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,496
And a son by your ex-wife, Joseph?

46
00:04:27,756 --> 00:04:29,665
A son? Yeah.
What about him? Joey.

47
00:04:29,924 --> 00:04:31,834
Are you involved in his upbringing?

48
00:04:32,052 --> 00:04:34,887
Involved?
She attached my paycheck, child support.

49
00:04:35,138 --> 00:04:38,721
Why do you think I got a court-appointed
lawyer instead of an experienced one?

50
00:04:38,975 --> 00:04:41,846
I understand.
How often do you see your son?

51
00:04:42,062 --> 00:04:43,936
The kid? I don't know.

52
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:46,645
On his birthday. When was that?
May, I think.

53
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,687
She don't like for me to see him.
Thinks I'm a bad influence.

54
00:04:49,903 --> 00:04:52,228
I think you should see your son.

55
00:04:52,906 --> 00:04:56,904
Try to get your boss to write a note
about your performance on the job.

56
00:04:57,161 --> 00:05:01,455
Create the impression of a decent
citizen with familial responsibilities...

57
00:05:01,707 --> 00:05:04,874
...who happened to slip up once.

58
00:05:05,127 --> 00:05:09,836
And I know that you're having
financial difficulties, Mr. LaPlante...

59
00:05:10,091 --> 00:05:14,587
...but I was wondering if the money
that I loaned you last week...

60
00:05:18,724 --> 00:05:20,219
Some of it.

61
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:24,390
I'll get you the rest as soon as I can.

62
00:05:24,605 --> 00:05:28,817
If you're a little short, it's okay.
I don't want to take your last dime.

63
00:05:29,068 --> 00:05:31,476
I'd better keep some of it,
if I'll see the kid.

64
00:05:31,696 --> 00:05:33,570
For gas and stuff.

65
00:05:40,205 --> 00:05:43,538
Look at that one.
If you were in there, he'd kill you.

66
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,030
Wouldn't he, Dad?

67
00:05:48,672 --> 00:05:51,079
Yeah, yeah. Something like that.

68
00:05:54,719 --> 00:05:57,389
You know this friend
that your mother's seeing?

69
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:59,217
What is he, a fireman?

70
00:05:59,433 --> 00:06:03,513
Did he ever, you know, just kind of
spend the night? What's his name?

71
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,728
Sometimes. His name is Elliott.

72
00:06:05,981 --> 00:06:08,306
He saved a guy's life
one time in a fire.

73
00:06:08,567 --> 00:06:09,812
A hero?

74
00:06:11,612 --> 00:06:14,364
Was he ever in the Nam,
this guy Elliott?

75
00:06:14,615 --> 00:06:16,323
The " Nam"? What's that?

76
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:19,031
It was this war, Vietnam.

77
00:06:19,411 --> 00:06:20,906
Doesn't matter.

78
00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:23,828
Were you in it? In the war?

79
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,372
- You didn't see that picture?
- What picture?

80
00:06:26,585 --> 00:06:30,286
Me in my uniform.
Used to be over the fireplace.

81
00:06:32,675 --> 00:06:35,842
In public restrooms,
you're always standing in piss.

82
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:37,839
It don't matter to you.
You got sneakers.

83
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:40,767
But I'm standing in piss
in very expensive shoes.

84
00:06:41,017 --> 00:06:43,425
I don't want piss on them.
I want to protect them.

85
00:06:43,645 --> 00:06:45,933
It's a breakdown in custodial services.

86
00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:48,228
Look, somebody lost their wallet.

87
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:49,686
What?

88
00:06:57,575 --> 00:07:00,327
- Wait a minute.
- To give it to the manager.

89
00:07:00,579 --> 00:07:02,867
He pockets the dough,
throws the wallet away.

90
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:07,874
We'll go out back. Most people who work
in supervisory positions are crooks.

91
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:09,077
You didn't pay.

92
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:11,538
The waiter knows me.
I got an account here.

93
00:07:12,049 --> 00:07:14,421
Tomorrow, when I get to the office...

94
00:07:14,676 --> 00:07:18,425
...my secretary will phone this guy up
from the name on his license.

95
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,090
Let the guy come and get his wallet.
Make sure you get a reward.

96
00:07:22,351 --> 00:07:24,094
You deserve a reward.

97
00:07:24,353 --> 00:07:25,764
Spare some change, sir?

98
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,688
No way, fella. Not a chance.

99
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,396
Resist the urge to be nice
to those people.

100
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:33,522
They're con artists.
Take advantage of the soft heart.

101
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:36,235
A lot of them are better off
than the rest of us.

102
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,946
Look out for number one.
It sounds harsh...

103
00:07:39,201 --> 00:07:42,037
...but it's a goddamn jungle out there.

104
00:07:42,246 --> 00:07:44,073
You got to keep a low profile.

105
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,321
Right?

106
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,873
A low profile.

107
00:07:59,222 --> 00:08:01,428
Hey, Bernie. Where you been, pal?

108
00:08:01,683 --> 00:08:03,925
Some guys been looking for me, Chick?

109
00:08:04,811 --> 00:08:07,100
Spanish kind of guys?

110
00:08:07,313 --> 00:08:10,398
Business thing.
Give me a seven and seven, will you?

111
00:08:14,154 --> 00:08:15,945
Five days now, I don't see you?

112
00:08:16,198 --> 00:08:20,943
It's because I'm up to my ass in shit.
I'm broke because I got legal problems.

113
00:08:21,203 --> 00:08:23,076
Nobody was asking for me, huh?

114
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:25,284
Nope.

115
00:08:25,624 --> 00:08:27,284
Legal problems?

116
00:08:27,543 --> 00:08:29,500
You gotta have a good attorney.

117
00:08:31,547 --> 00:08:36,256
She's just out of law school. A couple
years older than my kid, for chrissake.

118
00:08:36,552 --> 00:08:37,548
You got a kid?

119
00:08:38,262 --> 00:08:39,377
How old's your kid?

120
00:08:39,638 --> 00:08:42,010
Nine, I think. Maybe 10.

121
00:08:42,266 --> 00:08:44,508
Yeah, 10. Nice kid.

122
00:08:44,852 --> 00:08:47,177
You got a 10-year-old attorney, Bernie?

123
00:08:48,814 --> 00:08:50,558
I can't afford no better.

124
00:08:50,816 --> 00:08:54,399
My ex, she attached my paycheck
for child support payments.

125
00:08:56,489 --> 00:08:58,980
You looking for Bernie LaPlante
by any chance?

126
00:08:59,283 --> 00:09:00,279
You have a kid?

127
00:09:00,535 --> 00:09:03,405
Kids are so young.
They don't know nothing yet.

128
00:09:03,663 --> 00:09:06,699
When you're a kid, you think
you'll grow up to be wonderful...

129
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:09,449
...instead of an asshole,
like everybody else.

130
00:09:10,211 --> 00:09:11,587
We're all assholes?

131
00:09:11,963 --> 00:09:16,625
When I was a kid, I thought I was gonna
be this fantastic, heroic human being.

132
00:09:16,885 --> 00:09:18,794
Are you Bernie LaPlanta?

133
00:09:20,472 --> 00:09:22,963
LaPlante. Bernie LaPlante.

134
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,676
You the guys that Bunny called?

135
00:09:36,196 --> 00:09:38,652
Three hours is old, man. Very old.

136
00:09:38,907 --> 00:09:42,822
He might not have reported them
at all yet. He might not know.

137
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:45,154
What did you do? Pick his pocket?

138
00:09:45,998 --> 00:09:46,863
More or less.

139
00:09:47,124 --> 00:09:49,449
Trust me. These are very, very fresh.

140
00:09:51,795 --> 00:09:55,959
<i>To be honest with you, it doesn't
make sense to me either, Miss Gayley.</i>

141
00:09:56,217 --> 00:09:58,126
<i>Things seem to be on the upswing.</i>

142
00:09:58,385 --> 00:10:02,051
<i>Our difficulties with the SEC
have been favourably resolved.</i>

143
00:10:02,473 --> 00:10:05,723
In a business sense,
I think we've turned the corner.

144
00:10:06,143 --> 00:10:09,180
Your wife and children are
on the way here. Don't you-

145
00:10:09,438 --> 00:10:13,021
Thank you for coming out here
and letting me talk to you.

146
00:10:13,651 --> 00:10:15,940
Oh, my God! Chucky, tilt down!

147
00:10:19,574 --> 00:10:20,854
Did you get it?

148
00:10:21,117 --> 00:10:23,573
Jesus! Did I say that?

149
00:10:25,205 --> 00:10:26,996
Yeah, I got it!

150
00:10:28,249 --> 00:10:30,954
Sports training.
Learn to follow the ball!

151
00:10:31,378 --> 00:10:34,332
Listen, how about you do
your wrap-up from up here?

152
00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:39,714
I'll pull back from that skyscraper,
find you here, then reveal the drop.

153
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,136
Suicide number 137 of this year,
in this city...

154
00:10:44,391 --> 00:10:46,929
...was neither a destitute,
nor a lonely man...

155
00:10:47,185 --> 00:10:50,139
...but a successful executive
with a loving family...

156
00:10:50,355 --> 00:10:52,728
...and 40 million dollars in the bank.

157
00:10:53,025 --> 00:10:55,563
<i>If there's nameless despair
in executive offices...</i>

158
00:10:55,819 --> 00:10:59,734
<i>...what can there be 60 stories below,
where the hungry and the homeless...</i>

159
00:10:59,948 --> 00:11:03,816
<i>...the brutalized and the addicted,
fight their daily battle for survival?</i>

160
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:06,403
<i>From a ledge 60 stories
above the street...</i>

161
00:11:06,622 --> 00:11:09,243
<i>...I'm Gale Gayley for Channel 4 News.</i>

162
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:12,702
What'd you think of the fall shot?

163
00:11:12,962 --> 00:11:16,247
The guy drops 20 stories
in perfect focus, centre frame...

164
00:11:16,465 --> 00:11:18,707
...while I smoothly go
from F16 to F56.

165
00:11:18,968 --> 00:11:22,171
Hell of a shot, Chucky.
It's beautiful. Parker!

166
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:25,099
Run this to Frazier.
Open with it at 6, 11 and 7 a. m.

167
00:11:25,349 --> 00:11:29,394
Bet she pushed him just
for the great shot. Blind ambition.

168
00:11:29,646 --> 00:11:32,516
Pushed him? Oh, my God.
Not really?

169
00:11:32,774 --> 00:11:35,858
Conklin's jealous
because it wasn't his story.

170
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,518
It tore her up because
we couldn't save the guy.

171
00:11:38,738 --> 00:11:40,565
She wanted to reach out.

172
00:11:40,782 --> 00:11:41,695
Like the suicide?

173
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,527
- Never reach out.
- Mr. Wallace.

174
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,775
It's unprofessional.

175
00:11:45,036 --> 00:11:46,863
You could get pulled over.

176
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,832
- What are we talking about?
- How we didn't save him.

177
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:53,873
Saving people is not our job.
It's wrong to step in and save someone.

178
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:55,208
You wouldn't push him?

179
00:11:55,422 --> 00:11:57,082
I didn't say we should've saved him.

180
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:00,544
I said I wish it had occurred to me
to consider saving him.

181
00:12:00,802 --> 00:12:03,376
- What good would that do?
- It'd make me feel human.

182
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:06,302
It's not a bad story.
" Newswoman Saves Suicide. "

183
00:12:06,558 --> 00:12:09,346
- It's unprofessional.
- You can't bear good news.

184
00:12:09,561 --> 00:12:12,977
- You're sitting on your ticket.
- Ticket? What's going on?

185
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,646
She's flying to N.Y.
for a Silver Mike Award.

186
00:12:15,859 --> 00:12:18,979
Silver Mike?
You are covering us in glory.

187
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,278
Well, I haven't won yet.

188
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:25,358
You have me scheduled on a flight back
an hour after the ceremony.

189
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:29,748
For heaven's sake, let's give her
a night in N.Y.C. Listen.

190
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,499
We'll put her boyfriend-

191
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,618
She broke up with her boyfriend.

192
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,537
We need you back
to follow up on that jumper.

193
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:41,881
The human interest in the unending woe
pouring from the wounded metropolis.

194
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,259
- The dirt, you mean?
- That too.

195
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,631
Would you put me up
in a really good hotel?

196
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:47,805
Absolutely.

197
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:49,637
So long, babe.

198
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,436
Okay, the hell with it.

199
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,228
Party on. Is that what they say?

200
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:59,444
I'll figure something out.

201
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:02,819
She's pretending to be a person.
She's a reporter.

202
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:05,197
$50 says she'll be back
on the first flight.

203
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:22,714
I don't understand what you mean
by "technicality," Mr. LaPlante.

204
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,971
You were found guilty
by a jury of your peers.

205
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:30,802
The cops didn't follow
the correct procedure with the evidence.

206
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:34,021
That should have been
established by your attorney.

207
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:38,775
I'm broke. I got this court-appointed
lawyer. She don't know nothing.

208
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:40,362
Mr. LaPlante...

209
00:13:40,613 --> 00:13:45,489
...my job is to make a recommendation
for sentencing, based on this interview.

210
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:47,611
I'm not a criminal.

211
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:50,444
Buying stolen goods?
It's a little technical thing.

212
00:13:50,707 --> 00:13:53,494
Do I rob anybody? Do I hit anybody?

213
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:55,993
Don't clutter up prisons
with guys like me.

214
00:13:56,254 --> 00:13:57,914
Prisons are for tough guys.

215
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:02,008
Prisons are for guys who like
to beat each other up.

216
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:09,008
I can't do that kind of time. I don't
belong in that kind of environment.

217
00:14:09,267 --> 00:14:10,548
Give me a break.

218
00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:12,014
Look.

219
00:14:13,563 --> 00:14:15,971
I got this kid, 9, 10 years old.

220
00:14:16,191 --> 00:14:18,812
I'm taking him to the movies
tonight after work.

221
00:14:19,069 --> 00:14:20,611
He worships me.

222
00:14:20,862 --> 00:14:24,314
If I go to the slammer,
what's this going to do to the kid?

223
00:14:24,825 --> 00:14:27,861
I'm his goddamn role model,
for chrissake.

224
00:14:28,287 --> 00:14:32,450
I don't have to explain how much my
cameraman, editor, assignment editor...

225
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:37,079
...and news director, to name a few,
did to get me this award.

226
00:14:42,009 --> 00:14:43,717
This is an onion.

227
00:14:44,595 --> 00:14:46,967
It's a metaphor for a news story.

228
00:14:47,223 --> 00:14:51,221
A few hours ago, I was standing on
a ledge 60 stories above the street...

229
00:14:51,435 --> 00:14:55,385
...interviewing a man who subsequently
jumped to his death.

230
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:59,984
Forty million dollars in the bank,
happily married, good health.

231
00:15:00,236 --> 00:15:01,861
Great story.

232
00:15:03,573 --> 00:15:07,191
But there's got to be more.
I mean, we're pros, right?

233
00:15:07,452 --> 00:15:11,615
Some kind of extramarital
hanky-panky, maybe?

234
00:15:11,873 --> 00:15:13,153
Another great story.

235
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,002
Maybe the guy's been accused
of child molesting.

236
00:15:17,253 --> 00:15:18,961
A terrific story.

237
00:15:19,172 --> 00:15:21,924
What? It turns out
the accusations were false?

238
00:15:22,175 --> 00:15:24,382
Wonderful. More story.

239
00:15:24,886 --> 00:15:28,966
Maybe the alleged mistress was lying.
Setting the guy up, huh?

240
00:15:29,182 --> 00:15:31,258
Sensational story.

241
00:15:31,476 --> 00:15:33,599
So we keep going.

242
00:15:33,854 --> 00:15:35,478
Excuse me. Keep digging.

243
00:15:35,814 --> 00:15:37,095
Keep investigating.

244
00:15:37,316 --> 00:15:39,522
We expose the guy's whole life.
His family.

245
00:15:39,776 --> 00:15:41,520
Why? Because we're pros.

246
00:15:41,737 --> 00:15:43,979
Because we're looking for the truth.

247
00:15:44,573 --> 00:15:47,325
But what if it turns out,
after all our digging...

248
00:15:47,576 --> 00:15:50,577
...after all our
painstaking investigation...

249
00:15:50,829 --> 00:15:53,617
What if it turns out
there wasn't any truth?

250
00:15:53,874 --> 00:15:55,285
Just stories.

251
00:15:55,543 --> 00:15:58,413
One story after another,
until there's nothing left.

252
00:15:58,671 --> 00:16:01,423
And do we have any obligation
to stop at any point?

253
00:16:01,674 --> 00:16:06,502
Or do we just keep going, digging,
peeling until we've peeled it all away?

254
00:16:06,762 --> 00:16:10,262
Until we've destroyed what
we investigated in the first place.

255
00:16:16,272 --> 00:16:20,400
I'll bet all of you, like me...

256
00:16:20,652 --> 00:16:22,609
...yearn for just one story...

257
00:16:22,862 --> 00:16:26,611
...that isn't about unveiling
layer after layer of human weakness.

258
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:30,404
A story that reveals,
with each layer of investigation...

259
00:16:30,662 --> 00:16:34,446
...something finer and nobler.

260
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:39,461
Something even inspirational.

261
00:16:51,934 --> 00:16:54,685
No, it's very nice, actually.

262
00:16:57,398 --> 00:17:00,731
" For Excellence
in the Pursuit of Truth. "

263
00:17:02,861 --> 00:17:06,990
Listen, I got a seat back
on the early flight after all. So...

264
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,030
What? What do you mean
you gave it to Conklin?

265
00:17:12,288 --> 00:17:15,158
He wasn't the one
the guy wanted to talk to!

266
00:17:15,374 --> 00:17:17,450
You were gonna do the town, remember?

267
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:21,577
Fancy suite at the station's expense,
see a show, maybe get laid.

268
00:17:21,797 --> 00:17:24,205
<i>- What was I supposed to do?
- Cut the shit!</i>

269
00:17:24,467 --> 00:17:28,928
<i>I'm not gonna hang around N. Y. while
you give away my stories to Conklin!</i>

270
00:17:29,138 --> 00:17:32,638
You get back tonight, doll.
I'll take Conklin off your suicide.

271
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:35,970
Fly carefully.
Congratulations on the award.

272
00:17:37,897 --> 00:17:40,982
What did I tell you?
They're all alike, the good ones.

273
00:17:41,609 --> 00:17:44,776
They're junkies for the story.
Can't let go.

274
00:17:45,155 --> 00:17:49,022
<i>First rule out here on the streets is,
watch out for number one.</i>

275
00:17:49,284 --> 00:17:54,160
<i>If you go down, you break a bone,
you're gone. Nobody'll pick you up.</i>

276
00:17:54,372 --> 00:17:55,831
Shitty colour.

277
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,915
Look at the skin tones.

278
00:17:58,126 --> 00:18:01,910
Chrissake. Homeless people are
supposed to have shitty skin tones.

279
00:18:10,013 --> 00:18:12,386
There you go. Skin tones.

280
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:16,467
I wouldn't even do this
if I didn't have legal problems.

281
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:20,264
Ninety-five dollars, that's it.
I got to get out of here.

282
00:18:23,277 --> 00:18:25,483
I gotta take my kid to the movies.

283
00:18:25,863 --> 00:18:28,021
- I'm late. My kid's waiting.
- Fifty.

284
00:18:28,616 --> 00:18:31,237
How about a watch? Wanna buy a watch?

285
00:18:31,452 --> 00:18:33,077
Same kind I got, huh?

286
00:18:34,163 --> 00:18:37,117
Tell you what. Give me $85
for the machine, the watch.

287
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:42,120
I'll throw in a couple of wheel covers,
a case of insect repellent. Here.

288
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,788
You need an air filter?

289
00:18:50,054 --> 00:18:52,094
I could've predicted this.

290
00:18:52,348 --> 00:18:55,053
It's raining because
my wipers are all fucked up.

291
00:18:55,310 --> 00:19:00,221
If my wipers were okay, the fucking sun
would be shining at night.

292
00:19:10,742 --> 00:19:11,987
Damn it!

293
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,035
Damn it!

294
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:24,540
<i>We're experiencing a high reading
on one of our indicators.</i>

295
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:27,918
<i>Probably a malfunction in the gauge,
but as a precaution...</i>

296
00:19:28,385 --> 00:19:33,380
<i>...fasten your seat belts while we
run you through some safety procedures.</i>

297
00:19:33,641 --> 00:19:37,769
First, make sure that your seat belts
are fastened securely.

298
00:19:39,105 --> 00:19:41,975
When the captain gives the signal,
brace your arms...

299
00:19:42,191 --> 00:19:45,276
...against the seat in front
of you like this.

300
00:19:46,487 --> 00:19:48,859
You may use pillows and blankets...

301
00:19:49,073 --> 00:19:50,865
...to protect your face...

302
00:19:51,075 --> 00:19:53,862
...from flying glass and debris.

303
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:58,367
Before you do, remove
your eyeglasses and your shoes...

304
00:20:15,016 --> 00:20:20,011
Remember, our biggest asset
in an emergency is calm, clear thinking.

305
00:20:20,564 --> 00:20:25,440
All of us on the crew have been
carefully trained for emergencies...

306
00:20:29,072 --> 00:20:30,483
Come on! Come on!

307
00:20:30,908 --> 00:20:33,659
I'm late already. Don't quit on me now.

308
00:20:37,414 --> 00:20:39,074
Come on! Come on!

309
00:21:28,049 --> 00:21:29,212
Now what?

310
00:21:48,404 --> 00:21:49,779
Somebody!

311
00:21:49,989 --> 00:21:52,277
Is anybody out there?

312
00:21:57,788 --> 00:21:59,911
Is anybody there?

313
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:02,372
What's the problem, pal?

314
00:22:12,678 --> 00:22:15,134
Just stay calm everyone!
Everyone, please!

315
00:22:15,348 --> 00:22:17,839
Stay calm! Please don't push!

316
00:22:18,101 --> 00:22:19,096
Everyone, please!

317
00:22:19,352 --> 00:22:22,306
Everything will be all right
if we just stay calm!

318
00:22:31,698 --> 00:22:33,157
I can't move.

319
00:22:34,784 --> 00:22:37,157
- I'm trapped.
- Get me out of here!

320
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:39,363
Mommy! Mommy!

321
00:22:40,707 --> 00:22:42,367
Help! We're stuck!

322
00:22:42,626 --> 00:22:45,164
Hold it. Hold it. Just a minute.

323
00:22:52,052 --> 00:22:53,083
Please, Daddy!

324
00:22:53,345 --> 00:22:55,088
Wake up, Daddy!

325
00:22:55,305 --> 00:22:56,965
Please wake up.

326
00:22:57,182 --> 00:22:59,009
Somebody's coming.

327
00:22:59,476 --> 00:23:02,513
Hey, mister. Mister?
Can you give us a hand?

328
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:04,853
Hold on, buddy!

329
00:23:05,232 --> 00:23:08,186
We're talking $100 shoes here.

330
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:32,589
Shit!

331
00:23:33,928 --> 00:23:35,304
Shit!

332
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:39,260
Help us! Please!

333
00:23:39,726 --> 00:23:41,600
The handle's jammed!

334
00:23:41,811 --> 00:23:44,302
You've gotta push on the door!

335
00:23:45,398 --> 00:23:48,898
- You've gotta push hard!
- What do you think I'm doing?

336
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:52,195
Harder! Again! Come on.

337
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:54,571
- Push!
- I'm pushing it.

338
00:23:54,825 --> 00:23:57,779
- Harder!
- I'm pushing it, asshole!

339
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:14,543
Come on! One at a time!

340
00:24:14,762 --> 00:24:16,838
Don't push!

341
00:24:27,942 --> 00:24:31,393
When you get out, move as far away
from the plane as possible.

342
00:24:31,654 --> 00:24:34,323
Please, one at a time.
One at a time, please.

343
00:24:34,532 --> 00:24:37,403
Please, miss. My father can't move.
He can't move!

344
00:24:37,618 --> 00:24:39,362
We'll try to help him.
Wait outside.

345
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:42,871
Move as far away from
the plane as you can.

346
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:46,002
One at a time. Let's go! Let's go!

347
00:24:46,211 --> 00:24:48,618
There's a woman back there.
She's trapped!

348
00:24:49,339 --> 00:24:52,293
You get as far away
from the plane as you can.

349
00:24:56,096 --> 00:24:58,135
Daddy!

350
00:25:00,892 --> 00:25:02,684
Where's my shoes?

351
00:25:03,603 --> 00:25:05,596
Where are my shoes?

352
00:25:05,814 --> 00:25:08,103
Daddy, please!

353
00:25:10,902 --> 00:25:12,313
Sir, please!

354
00:25:12,571 --> 00:25:14,148
My dad can't move!

355
00:25:14,364 --> 00:25:15,645
Where? Where is he?

356
00:25:15,908 --> 00:25:17,532
In there. He's hurt!

357
00:25:17,785 --> 00:25:22,114
The cops are coming and the firemen.
They got equipment and stuff.

358
00:25:22,373 --> 00:25:25,208
They're experts.
Where are my shoes?

359
00:25:26,418 --> 00:25:29,585
Please, sir. Please.

360
00:25:30,089 --> 00:25:33,540
It's on fire. He can't move.

361
00:25:38,014 --> 00:25:39,591
Oh, for chrissake.

362
00:25:42,935 --> 00:25:44,429
What's his name?

363
00:25:44,645 --> 00:25:47,730
- Fletcher! Where are you?
- You can't come back in.

364
00:25:49,984 --> 00:25:52,107
Where are you, fella?

365
00:25:56,991 --> 00:25:58,569
Are you Fletcher?

366
00:26:01,371 --> 00:26:02,402
Who are you?

367
00:26:07,377 --> 00:26:08,752
Come on.

368
00:26:09,296 --> 00:26:11,834
Hey! Somebody grab him, will you?

369
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:13,715
Help this guy, will you?

370
00:26:13,967 --> 00:26:14,916
- Help him!
- Get him!

371
00:26:15,177 --> 00:26:17,549
Get him away from the plane!

372
00:26:18,054 --> 00:26:20,462
Get as far away from
the plane as you can!

373
00:26:20,724 --> 00:26:23,595
Where are you? Hey, buddy.
Goddamn it!

374
00:26:24,811 --> 00:26:26,804
Fletcher, speak up.
Don't be an asshole.

375
00:26:32,277 --> 00:26:33,440
Oh, shit.

376
00:26:39,493 --> 00:26:40,987
My leg is caught.

377
00:26:41,579 --> 00:26:44,034
My leg is caught.

378
00:26:47,668 --> 00:26:49,043
Can you get me out of here?

379
00:26:49,253 --> 00:26:52,171
Oh, sure. Yeah, I think.

380
00:26:53,382 --> 00:26:54,925
Let me help you there.

381
00:27:03,142 --> 00:27:06,346
Give me a hand, lady.
I'm not a goddamn bodybuilder.

382
00:27:08,064 --> 00:27:11,563
Get away from the plane quickly.
It may explode!

383
00:27:32,673 --> 00:27:35,757
Give me a hand here, will you, honey?

384
00:27:51,901 --> 00:27:54,107
Move this piece of shit
out of here now.

385
00:27:54,361 --> 00:27:55,772
Come on!

386
00:27:56,197 --> 00:27:57,857
Dad!

387
00:28:00,951 --> 00:28:02,280
- Dad!
- Son.

388
00:28:02,536 --> 00:28:04,328
Thank God!

389
00:28:07,124 --> 00:28:08,784
Look out! It's ready to go!

390
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:12,667
- Put her on your shoulder.
- You better get out of here!

391
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,375
- You too, miss.
- Fletcher!

392
00:28:14,632 --> 00:28:16,210
I've lost count.

393
00:28:16,467 --> 00:28:19,967
- Right away!
- I think everybody's out.

394
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,762
Where are you?

395
00:28:31,691 --> 00:28:33,648
Here! I'm over here. Help me.

396
00:28:33,902 --> 00:28:35,230
- Where are you?
- Here.

397
00:28:35,487 --> 00:28:38,523
- Where?
- My leg is broken. I need help.

398
00:28:39,407 --> 00:28:41,863
- Fletcher, right?
- Smith.

399
00:28:42,285 --> 00:28:44,611
- You're not Fletcher?
- I'm Smith. Please help me.

400
00:28:44,871 --> 00:28:47,623
Fuck this!
I'm looking for Fletcher.

401
00:28:47,874 --> 00:28:51,244
No, don't leave me!
Please don't leave me.

402
00:28:52,588 --> 00:28:54,165
Oh, all right.

403
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:56,253
Come here.

404
00:28:56,842 --> 00:28:58,965
- Hold on. Come on.
- Oh, thank God.

405
00:28:59,178 --> 00:29:02,048
Don't count your chickens, Smith.
I can't see shit!

406
00:29:02,348 --> 00:29:03,806
Come out!
It's ready to blow!

407
00:29:04,058 --> 00:29:06,928
- There's another guy in there!
- Right goddamn now!

408
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:11,351
- Hey, you!
- Get out of there!

409
00:29:11,565 --> 00:29:14,401
Hey, you! Give me a hand here.
Come here!

410
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:16,276
- I'll help him.
- I got this guy.

411
00:29:16,487 --> 00:29:18,480
I'll help him. You run for it.

412
00:29:19,615 --> 00:29:22,735
- There's a guy in there!
- She's gonna explode!

413
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:25,911
There's a guy-
You're supposed to be a fireman!

414
00:29:26,122 --> 00:29:27,497
She's gonna go!

415
00:29:27,707 --> 00:29:29,166
Come on!

416
00:29:29,626 --> 00:29:32,330
Get back! It's gonna go!

417
00:29:32,545 --> 00:29:34,087
Come on, you stupid shit!

418
00:29:34,297 --> 00:29:36,503
I lost my other shoe.

419
00:29:40,387 --> 00:29:41,929
Get back!

420
00:29:43,139 --> 00:29:46,923
<i>- I need a medic here!
- Yes. Yes. Angle on fireman.</i>

421
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:48,383
<i>Jonesy!</i>

422
00:29:48,603 --> 00:29:50,014
Heroic. Backlit.

423
00:29:52,274 --> 00:29:54,646
Blazing inferno! Look at that.
Awesome!

424
00:29:54,901 --> 00:29:56,146
Major awards.

425
00:29:56,403 --> 00:29:59,653
He stands his ground,
capturing images of raging flames...

426
00:29:59,906 --> 00:30:02,777
...with no regard for
his own personal safety.

427
00:30:03,452 --> 00:30:04,863
Go, Chucky.

428
00:30:05,078 --> 00:30:06,952
Go, baby.

429
00:30:09,416 --> 00:30:11,124
Sorry, Fletcher.

430
00:30:15,756 --> 00:30:17,796
What a way to go, pal.

431
00:30:18,217 --> 00:30:19,047
<i>I'm okay.</i>

432
00:30:19,301 --> 00:30:20,926
- You're not okay.
- I'm a reporter.

433
00:30:21,137 --> 00:30:24,091
- She's got a broken arm.
- It's my leg. My leg hurts.

434
00:30:24,348 --> 00:30:26,590
Chucky! Chucky!

435
00:30:26,851 --> 00:30:29,223
Holy shit! It's Gayley. Gayley!

436
00:30:29,437 --> 00:30:30,979
- Hold up.
- You were on the plane?

437
00:30:31,188 --> 00:30:33,477
It's my story, Conk.
I did the research.

438
00:30:33,733 --> 00:30:35,560
Get the attendant
who manned the door.

439
00:30:35,818 --> 00:30:38,488
Also, some passenger pulled me out.
Talk to him!

440
00:30:38,696 --> 00:30:41,270
- Then get to the hospital.
- She's a piece of work.

441
00:30:41,532 --> 00:30:45,115
Unbelievable. " It's my story.
I did the research"?

442
00:30:45,328 --> 00:30:48,246
You wouldn't believe the shot I got.
Major award.

443
00:30:48,456 --> 00:30:51,208
I start in this fireman's face.
Fantastic!

444
00:30:51,459 --> 00:30:53,084
You know, sad but excited.

445
00:31:04,181 --> 00:31:06,387
Where's my car?

446
00:31:08,977 --> 00:31:10,222
My car was right here.

447
00:31:10,437 --> 00:31:12,643
- Where's my-?
- Where are you hurt?

448
00:31:12,898 --> 00:31:17,227
Where are you hurt?
Why don't we go over to the ambulance?

449
00:31:17,444 --> 00:31:21,822
I don't need an ambulance. I'm looking
for my car. It must've burnt up.

450
00:31:22,032 --> 00:31:25,152
You weren't in your car.
You've been in a plane crash.

451
00:31:25,411 --> 00:31:28,910
Please! My daughter needs
medical attention.

452
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,672
- He waited for hours.
- You won't believe it.

453
00:32:26,932 --> 00:32:29,637
- I'm tired of your bullshit!
- It's not my fault.

454
00:32:29,893 --> 00:32:32,349
It's never your fault! Never, ever!

455
00:32:32,604 --> 00:32:34,846
You screwed up my life
and now your son's.

456
00:32:35,107 --> 00:32:38,191
And you'll never accept
responsibility for anything!

457
00:32:38,444 --> 00:32:40,152
Is your friend, the fireman, here?

458
00:32:40,404 --> 00:32:43,654
He had an emergency call.
A real emergency!

459
00:32:43,866 --> 00:32:47,946
Why don't you let me in, instead of
waking up the whole neighbourhood?

460
00:32:48,621 --> 00:32:50,993
If you let me talk,
I'll tell you what happened.

461
00:32:51,207 --> 00:32:54,208
What happened is the same thing
that always happens.

462
00:32:54,418 --> 00:32:58,997
You blew it. Only this time, you broke
your son's heart instead of mine.

463
00:32:59,215 --> 00:33:02,964
He was looking forward to
going to the movies with his father.

464
00:33:03,177 --> 00:33:06,262
And you let him down
like you let everyone down, always.

465
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:08,765
Did you take a mud bath?

466
00:33:10,977 --> 00:33:12,388
That's what I'm trying to-

467
00:33:12,604 --> 00:33:14,098
Shut up, Bernie!

468
00:33:16,775 --> 00:33:19,147
Forget it. Let me talk to Joey
to apologize.

469
00:33:19,402 --> 00:33:24,029
He's in bed. And you won't wake him up
and make him crazy. Understand?

470
00:33:24,282 --> 00:33:28,612
He comes home and wants to know
if Elliott's a war hero, like you.

471
00:33:28,829 --> 00:33:32,992
- He wants to know how many you killed.
- Elliott? Elliott, the fireman.

472
00:33:33,208 --> 00:33:35,829
I had to explain your tendency
to exaggerate.

473
00:33:36,086 --> 00:33:40,713
How you killed as many people as
the other supply clerks in your outfit.

474
00:33:40,966 --> 00:33:45,545
- I didn't say I killed anyone.
- Whatever! You let him believe it!

475
00:33:45,804 --> 00:33:48,342
Then I had to explain
about the homeless.

476
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:51,683
How not all of them own
apartment complexes.

477
00:33:51,936 --> 00:33:53,845
How not all of them
play the stock market.

478
00:33:54,104 --> 00:33:56,975
How not all of them rent babies
when panhandling.

479
00:33:57,191 --> 00:33:59,314
He's a young boy, Bernie.

480
00:33:59,568 --> 00:34:01,608
Impressionable!

481
00:34:02,905 --> 00:34:04,814
Listen, Ev, it's important.

482
00:34:05,074 --> 00:34:07,031
- I gotta see him.
- Use the phone.

483
00:34:07,243 --> 00:34:10,114
- I've got important reasons.
- He'd love to hear from you.

484
00:34:10,371 --> 00:34:11,996
What happened to your shoe?

485
00:34:12,248 --> 00:34:15,498
No, I don't wanna know.
Some fantastic adventure, right?

486
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,418
Something really crazy?

487
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:20,126
All I was doing was
giving him advice.

488
00:34:20,381 --> 00:34:21,792
Preparing him for life.

489
00:34:22,008 --> 00:34:25,958
You don't want him to grow up soft,
do you? It's tough out there.

490
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:27,638
It's a goddamn jungle.

491
00:34:30,141 --> 00:34:32,051
Well, back to the jungle, Bernie.

492
00:35:36,459 --> 00:35:39,662
Sorry, Ev, to bother you again.
This is for Joey.

493
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:41,880
A reward...

494
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:44,083
...for this wallet he found.

495
00:35:44,426 --> 00:35:48,969
When I returned it, I told the guy
that he had to give my kid something...

496
00:35:49,222 --> 00:35:50,633
...for finding it.

497
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:55,558
You know, for the honesty.
So the kid would learn how honesty pays.

498
00:35:58,231 --> 00:36:01,316
Do you want to give it to him,
or should I?

499
00:36:27,011 --> 00:36:28,256
Moron.

500
00:36:33,059 --> 00:36:36,143
<i>You actually went into
a burning aeroplane?</i>

501
00:36:36,395 --> 00:36:39,557
Into it? I was practically
living in the goddamn thing.

502
00:36:39,816 --> 00:36:42,354
Every time I turned,
someone wants me to save them.

503
00:36:42,568 --> 00:36:45,688
I couldn't see a foot in front of me.
Then suddenly...

504
00:36:45,905 --> 00:36:48,231
...boom! It explodes.
I could be dead.

505
00:36:48,491 --> 00:36:51,492
But you pulled people out.
You're a hero.

506
00:36:51,703 --> 00:36:54,787
No, I fucked it up.
I was trying to impress this kid.

507
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,867
I was gonna rescue his old man but I
couldn't find him. He must've blew up.

508
00:37:01,505 --> 00:37:05,004
I got out of there.
I didn't have the nerve to face the kid.

509
00:37:05,926 --> 00:37:08,927
A lot of people wouldn't have tried.
It was a brave thing.

510
00:37:09,179 --> 00:37:10,887
Yeah, try stupid.

511
00:37:16,812 --> 00:37:19,054
Just toss them in the back, please.

512
00:37:21,066 --> 00:37:24,103
A lot of people would say
that's what heroism is...

513
00:37:24,361 --> 00:37:25,939
...stupidity.

514
00:37:27,406 --> 00:37:29,197
Doing something that,
if you thought about it...

515
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:32,202
...you wouldn't do it.
It's not in your interest.

516
00:37:34,163 --> 00:37:35,538
One more.

517
00:37:39,168 --> 00:37:41,161
All right. Is everything all right?

518
00:37:42,421 --> 00:37:44,544
I guess you kind of got
a drinking problem.

519
00:37:45,007 --> 00:37:49,136
I sell them at the recycling centre.
It gives me a bit for gas and food.

520
00:37:49,345 --> 00:37:51,172
Looks like you live in here.

521
00:37:51,431 --> 00:37:52,711
I do in bad weather.

522
00:37:53,516 --> 00:37:55,841
But mostly, I like
camping in the woods.

523
00:37:57,061 --> 00:37:59,137
I thought you were
down on your luck too.

524
00:37:59,355 --> 00:38:03,270
" Down on my luck"? I told you.
A goddamn plane fell on me...

525
00:38:03,526 --> 00:38:06,693
...from out of the sky, in America,
for chrissake.

526
00:38:07,072 --> 00:38:10,772
See these shoes? $100 pair
of shoes. One shoe.

527
00:38:12,285 --> 00:38:17,078
- Give it to someone with one leg.
- One leg? Let me off. I'll take a bus.

528
00:38:17,332 --> 00:38:20,417
I know a man who sells stuff
at the recycling centre.

529
00:38:20,669 --> 00:38:23,919
He only has one leg.
I think it's the right foot.

530
00:38:24,172 --> 00:38:27,873
Sell it to him. You get a couple bucks.
It pays for the gas.

531
00:38:28,135 --> 00:38:30,174
He doesn't have any money.

532
00:38:32,723 --> 00:38:34,265
It's very kind of you.

533
00:38:34,475 --> 00:38:35,589
" Down on my luck. "

534
00:38:35,976 --> 00:38:39,226
I got some mud on me is all.
I got a nice apartment, stereo.

535
00:38:39,438 --> 00:38:41,478
We could listen to you on the news.

536
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:43,730
Are you worried about
the stock market?

537
00:38:43,943 --> 00:38:46,398
No, the plane crash.
Didn't they interview you?

538
00:38:47,446 --> 00:38:50,020
I don't give no interviews.

539
00:38:50,282 --> 00:38:52,690
That's a lot of shit.

540
00:38:53,703 --> 00:38:55,612
Keep a low profile.

541
00:38:55,955 --> 00:38:57,330
That's my motto.

542
00:38:59,041 --> 00:39:03,335
I got legal problems. My attorneys
don't like me talking to the media.

543
00:39:03,546 --> 00:39:07,129
Step on it. I'm supposed to be
in my office five minutes ago.

544
00:39:07,383 --> 00:39:09,839
My secretary...

545
00:39:10,053 --> 00:39:13,338
...has got appointments
booked for me, you know, all day.

546
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,470
I'm very late.

547
00:39:14,682 --> 00:39:18,976
One word. One word, LaPlante,
and you're fired. You got that?

548
00:39:19,229 --> 00:39:20,640
- Bill-
- Don't say " BilI"!

549
00:39:20,855 --> 00:39:23,347
Didn't I say,
"One word and you're fired"?

550
00:39:23,608 --> 00:39:28,603
Know why? Because it'll be an excuse.
" Bernie LaPlante, excuse number 4, 106."

551
00:39:28,864 --> 00:39:32,233
No, 4, 112. That's how many
excuses you've given me.

552
00:39:32,492 --> 00:39:34,865
I keep track of them electronically.

553
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,955
- I got legal problems.
- You talked! You're fired!

554
00:39:38,165 --> 00:39:40,204
Out of here! Out of here!

555
00:39:40,417 --> 00:39:41,698
Jesus Christ!

556
00:39:41,919 --> 00:39:44,754
I got people waiting.
I got orders coming in.

557
00:39:45,005 --> 00:39:47,164
And you, you're gonna
go out like that?

558
00:39:47,424 --> 00:39:49,666
Meet the public in
stocking fucking feet?

559
00:39:49,927 --> 00:39:50,876
I have problems.

560
00:39:51,095 --> 00:39:53,633
I don't care about your problems.
I care about mine...

561
00:39:53,889 --> 00:39:56,096
...and you're one of my problems.
Now get out!

562
00:39:56,308 --> 00:39:57,803
I was driving my car-

563
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,969
I don't want to hear anymore.

564
00:40:00,229 --> 00:40:03,265
- A plane fell on my head.
- Yeah, I'll be on your head.

565
00:40:03,566 --> 00:40:06,139
I don't understand.
You can't find him?

566
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,776
There's a lot of confusion
around what took place, Gale.

567
00:40:10,031 --> 00:40:12,901
But you said all the passengers
were accounted for.

568
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:15,152
The guy who pulled you out
wasn't a passenger.

569
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:17,777
A fireman, a paramedic?
He didn't have a uniform.

570
00:40:17,997 --> 00:40:20,915
From what we could get,
there's a kind of...

571
00:40:21,543 --> 00:40:24,460
...sort of, a mystery guy involved.

572
00:40:24,963 --> 00:40:26,920
We're piecing together
different accounts.

573
00:40:27,257 --> 00:40:28,834
A mystery guy.

574
00:40:29,676 --> 00:40:32,214
Not a passenger. Who?

575
00:40:32,637 --> 00:40:34,464
We don't know who he is. He...

576
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:35,968
He disappeared.

577
00:40:36,349 --> 00:40:40,098
A non-passenger, non-rescue worker...

578
00:40:40,353 --> 00:40:42,180
...went into a burning plane...

579
00:40:42,439 --> 00:40:45,440
...and pulled me out and disappeared?

580
00:40:45,692 --> 00:40:48,777
This guy's the one who
opened the emergency exit...

581
00:40:48,987 --> 00:40:50,529
...from the outside.

582
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:54,232
Saved everyone on the plane.
Because of him, no fatalities.

583
00:40:54,451 --> 00:40:57,238
I don't think you should be
moving around like that.

584
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:58,990
Chucky, where's your camera?

585
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:00,707
Get this thing.

586
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,458
- Bring that.
- Easy.

587
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:03,783
All of a sudden...

588
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:07,164
...this civilian
rushes into the plane.

589
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:09,382
What did he look like?

590
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:12,676
It was just this face, all dirty.

591
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:14,173
It just appeared.

592
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:16,132
He was asking for Mr. Fletcher.

593
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:19,303
My son and I got separated in...

594
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,849
...the confusion and smoke.

595
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:25,889
The very courageous stewardess
told me my boy had gotten out.

596
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,858
So I got out too.

597
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:29,729
But my son had already
told this man...

598
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:32,238
<i>...that I was still in there.</i>

599
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:37,324
<i>I thought my dad was still...</i>

600
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:41,618
...still in there. So I asked
the man to save my father.

601
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:44,290
What did the man say, Richie?

602
00:41:46,046 --> 00:41:47,837
He said...

603
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:51,422
He said:

604
00:41:51,635 --> 00:41:54,126
" I'll save him. " He said,
" I'll save your father. "

605
00:41:55,681 --> 00:41:56,511
Thanks.

606
00:42:30,675 --> 00:42:32,714
<i>I need a medic here!</i>

607
00:42:32,969 --> 00:42:34,546
<i>I need a medic!</i>

608
00:42:34,762 --> 00:42:36,838
<i>Jonesy!</i>

609
00:42:38,307 --> 00:42:41,262
<i>- Shit!
- Now freeze. Go back, you missed it.</i>

610
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,267
Keep going, keep going.

611
00:42:49,736 --> 00:42:50,566
Back.

612
00:42:53,365 --> 00:42:56,235
Now, go forward again.
Missed it again.

613
00:43:07,504 --> 00:43:08,749
There.

614
00:43:09,881 --> 00:43:11,673
Right there.

615
00:43:14,469 --> 00:43:15,383
That's him?

616
00:43:16,138 --> 00:43:18,546
Who else? We've accounted
for everybody else.

617
00:43:18,974 --> 00:43:21,050
- That's our hero.
- I didn't even notice him.

618
00:43:21,268 --> 00:43:25,017
I was into the foreground drama.
Heroic fireman, looming in the frame.

619
00:43:25,272 --> 00:43:27,644
Can we do some kind of
electronic enhancement?

620
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:30,272
Get a clear picture?
Identify him?

621
00:43:34,698 --> 00:43:36,905
Far out.

622
00:43:37,618 --> 00:43:39,278
Never saw him.

623
00:43:40,663 --> 00:43:43,913
It's the camera.
It has a life of its own.

624
00:43:44,167 --> 00:43:47,785
At times I feel as if we were one,
capturing little moments...

625
00:43:48,045 --> 00:43:50,168
...of history in a kaleidoscope...

626
00:43:50,423 --> 00:43:52,546
...of colours and drama.

627
00:44:03,686 --> 00:44:04,682
There's no face.

628
00:44:04,938 --> 00:44:06,729
There's nothing to work with.

629
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:09,645
Big dots. That's all
you're gonna get.

630
00:44:09,901 --> 00:44:10,897
Look at that guy.

631
00:44:11,695 --> 00:44:13,771
He just saved 54 people.

632
00:44:14,322 --> 00:44:16,944
And now he's gonna disappear.

633
00:44:18,452 --> 00:44:19,447
Who is he?

634
00:44:28,086 --> 00:44:30,922
<i>"I'll save him."
He said, "I'll save your father."</i>

635
00:44:31,173 --> 00:44:34,459
<i>All of a sudden, this civilian...</i>

636
00:44:35,344 --> 00:44:37,004
<i>...he rushed into the plane.</i>

637
00:44:37,262 --> 00:44:41,806
<i>Leslie, the other flight attendant,
told me the guy dragged me...</i>

638
00:44:42,059 --> 00:44:43,055
<i>...to the exit.</i>

639
00:44:43,269 --> 00:44:46,139
<i>"Here, give this guy
a hand," he said.</i>

640
00:44:46,939 --> 00:44:48,647
<i>And the next thing I knew...</i>

641
00:44:49,066 --> 00:44:51,392
<i>...he was going back in there.</i>

642
00:44:51,652 --> 00:44:53,230
<i>Into all that smoke.</i>

643
00:44:53,946 --> 00:44:56,153
<i>Out of the darkness.
Out of the smoke...</i>

644
00:44:56,407 --> 00:44:59,907
<i>...and the fear,
came a man with no name.</i>

645
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:01,578
<i>No uniform...</i>

646
00:45:01,788 --> 00:45:03,911
<i>...but an abundance of courage.</i>

647
00:45:04,165 --> 00:45:07,748
<i>A man who was thinking not about
himself, but about others.</i>

648
00:45:08,002 --> 00:45:10,540
<i>Risking his own life for ours.</i>

649
00:45:11,256 --> 00:45:13,877
<i>He's out there now, somewhere...</i>

650
00:45:14,968 --> 00:45:16,711
<i>...and whoever you are...</i>

651
00:45:16,928 --> 00:45:19,965
<i>...I and the other survivors
of Flight 104 say...</i>

652
00:45:20,223 --> 00:45:23,888
<i>...thank you. God bless you.</i>

653
00:45:39,409 --> 00:45:43,703
If you're gonna wear a cast, feature
it more. It's part of the story.

654
00:45:43,997 --> 00:45:46,405
Network wants to feed off our 6:00...

655
00:45:46,667 --> 00:45:48,743
...whether we find the guy or not.

656
00:45:48,961 --> 00:45:51,878
It's a wonderful piece.
Emotional. I love it.

657
00:45:52,131 --> 00:45:53,411
We'll feature Gale's cast.

658
00:45:53,674 --> 00:45:56,426
My cast is only interesting until
the hero shows up.

659
00:45:56,635 --> 00:45:58,011
Then whoever has him, has the story.

660
00:45:58,262 --> 00:45:59,590
Good reason for you
to find him.

661
00:45:59,847 --> 00:46:01,222
You should be out digging.

662
00:46:01,432 --> 00:46:04,184
We could help her out.
How about offering a reward?

663
00:46:04,435 --> 00:46:06,060
In return for
an exclusive interview.

664
00:46:06,312 --> 00:46:08,435
Money and news. Dangerous waters.

665
00:46:08,689 --> 00:46:11,097
He's right. We don't even
know what he looks like.

666
00:46:11,317 --> 00:46:14,816
Of course you know what he looks like.
He saved you, right?

667
00:46:15,071 --> 00:46:16,150
They found what?

668
00:46:16,406 --> 00:46:18,979
<i>A phone check with survivors has
confirmed that the shoe...</i>

669
00:46:19,242 --> 00:46:23,370
<i>...does not belong to any of
the passengers or crew of Flight 104.</i>

670
00:46:23,621 --> 00:46:26,539
<i>However, several witnesses recall
the mysterious man...</i>

671
00:46:26,791 --> 00:46:30,326
<i>...who saved 54 people, referring
to his missing shoe.</i>

672
00:46:30,587 --> 00:46:31,915
<i>The conclusion is...</i>

673
00:46:32,172 --> 00:46:36,501
<i>...the unknown hero, known to many
as the Angel of Flight 104...</i>

674
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,752
<i>- ... wears a size 1 OB.
- Joey!</i>

675
00:46:39,012 --> 00:46:41,681
Dinner, now!
Turn that thing off!

676
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:43,556
Mom! Mom!

677
00:46:43,809 --> 00:46:46,679
He lost his shoe!
He lost his shoe!

678
00:46:47,604 --> 00:46:49,396
- He lost his shoe.
- Who did?

679
00:46:49,606 --> 00:46:50,472
The unknown hero.

680
00:46:50,732 --> 00:46:52,357
Wash your hands.

681
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:54,935
They found his shoe right beside
the plane crash.

682
00:46:55,195 --> 00:46:58,196
Superman, you mean? Lost his shoe?
What next?

683
00:46:58,449 --> 00:47:01,485
Elliott, the man saved
hundreds of people.

684
00:47:01,702 --> 00:47:02,865
Fifty-four.

685
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,243
I was there, remember?

686
00:47:05,456 --> 00:47:08,492
You know why none of us
rushed in that plane?

687
00:47:08,751 --> 00:47:10,874
Because we're trained firemen,
that's why.

688
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:13,584
Part of a team, a disciplined team.

689
00:47:13,798 --> 00:47:16,205
We take chances all the time,
save people's lives.

690
00:47:16,467 --> 00:47:18,175
But we don't do crazy things.

691
00:47:18,427 --> 00:47:21,927
This guy does something
really dumb and he lucks out.

692
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:25,259
So the media go crazy over
his shoe, for God's sakes!

693
00:47:25,476 --> 00:47:27,765
What message are they
giving to the youth?

694
00:47:27,979 --> 00:47:30,055
What message are you
giving to the youth?

695
00:47:30,315 --> 00:47:33,434
Sneering at someone
for sticking his neck out.

696
00:47:33,693 --> 00:47:36,564
You sound like my ex,
for heaven's sake. Mr. Cynicism.

697
00:47:36,821 --> 00:47:37,817
So what can I say?

698
00:47:38,031 --> 00:47:42,278
Give your ex credit for being smart
enough not to do something stupid.

699
00:47:42,535 --> 00:47:44,243
Maybe the guy's not all bad.

700
00:47:44,496 --> 00:47:48,624
I'm gonna watch TV and hope it's not
all this "Superman" stuff.

701
00:47:55,674 --> 00:47:58,212
My father only had one shoe on...

702
00:47:58,468 --> 00:47:59,666
...when he came here.

703
00:47:59,886 --> 00:48:03,220
You were in bed, weren't you?

704
00:48:03,724 --> 00:48:06,131
I saw him out the window.

705
00:48:08,228 --> 00:48:10,387
You think he would do
something like that?

706
00:48:10,606 --> 00:48:12,598
Rescue people?

707
00:48:13,943 --> 00:48:16,647
Your father is Bernie LaPlante.

708
00:48:16,946 --> 00:48:21,608
It's against his religion
to stick his neck out.

709
00:48:25,204 --> 00:48:27,078
Sit down.

710
00:48:27,331 --> 00:48:30,535
<i>The warden of a Montana prison
insists the unknown hero...</i>

711
00:48:30,793 --> 00:48:35,123
<i>...is a child molester who escaped
from the institution in April.</i>

712
00:48:35,381 --> 00:48:38,916
<i>In Scotland, the leader of
a religious sect claims...</i>

713
00:48:39,177 --> 00:48:44,088
<i>...the mysterious hero is, in fact,
an angel anticipated in scripture.</i>

714
00:48:44,349 --> 00:48:45,759
Hey, Bernie!

715
00:48:47,018 --> 00:48:48,892
- How's it going?
- You don't wanna know.

716
00:48:49,104 --> 00:48:50,977
You don't wanna know.

717
00:48:52,857 --> 00:48:55,064
Those guys been in yet?

718
00:48:55,318 --> 00:48:57,607
You in business with
them guys or what?

719
00:48:57,821 --> 00:48:59,529
I wouldn't want a
problem for the bar.

720
00:48:59,781 --> 00:49:01,406
You couldn't have a problem...

721
00:49:01,616 --> 00:49:05,828
...because I personally have got
them all. I cornered the whole market.

722
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:08,202
You wouldn't believe what
I've been through.

723
00:49:08,457 --> 00:49:11,411
You know, I was taking my car
to get my kid-

724
00:49:14,796 --> 00:49:15,710
How you doing?

725
00:49:15,964 --> 00:49:18,918
- Brought some friends, okay?
- Yeah, sure.

726
00:49:19,635 --> 00:49:21,212
Excuse me, Chick.

727
00:49:22,137 --> 00:49:25,222
<i>In addition, we bring you
a special announcement from...</i>

728
00:49:25,474 --> 00:49:26,885
<i>...Channel 4, station manager...</i>

729
00:49:27,142 --> 00:49:28,934
<i>...James Wallace.</i>

730
00:49:29,854 --> 00:49:31,348
<i>Good evening.</i>

731
00:49:31,605 --> 00:49:33,313
<i>We at Channel 4, like you,
have been...</i>

732
00:49:33,524 --> 00:49:35,647
<i>...stirred by the courage
and the humanity...</i>

733
00:49:35,901 --> 00:49:38,143
<i>Mi amigo. What do you got?
More plastic?</i>

734
00:49:38,404 --> 00:49:40,029
Yeah, plastic.

735
00:49:40,281 --> 00:49:41,905
Premium stuff here. High limits.

736
00:49:42,158 --> 00:49:44,067
Not reported.

737
00:49:44,327 --> 00:49:45,821
How do you know?

738
00:49:46,078 --> 00:49:47,905
Because I know. Trust me on this.

739
00:49:48,122 --> 00:49:50,827
<i>Hombre, he don't trust
his mother. Why you?</i>

740
00:49:51,084 --> 00:49:53,325
Because I'm not his mother.

741
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:56,626
<i>Por aqui?</i>

742
00:49:56,839 --> 00:49:58,962
<i>But then again, like you...</i>

743
00:49:59,175 --> 00:50:01,713
<i>...we want to see what is best in us.</i>

744
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:03,630
<i>We want to examine it.</i>

745
00:50:03,888 --> 00:50:06,510
<i>For that reason, we at
Channel 4 will offer...</i>

746
00:50:06,725 --> 00:50:10,509
<i>...this unknown hero
a reward of $1 million.</i>

747
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:12,977
How many of these you got?
Eight? Ten?

748
00:50:13,231 --> 00:50:15,271
They're gonna give that
guy $1 million.

749
00:50:15,525 --> 00:50:16,936
- Who?
- That plane crash guy.

750
00:50:17,194 --> 00:50:18,604
- A million bucks?
- That's right.

751
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:21,490
- Is this all of them, 8?
- What plane crash guy?

752
00:50:21,698 --> 00:50:24,236
The one-shoe dude.
The guy that saved those people.

753
00:50:24,493 --> 00:50:27,066
Channel 4's gonna give
this guy $1 million...

754
00:50:27,329 --> 00:50:28,907
...just for an interview!

755
00:50:29,706 --> 00:50:31,699
A million bucks!

756
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:39,001
<i>Hombre! We're trying to
do some business here.</i>

757
00:50:39,258 --> 00:50:42,129
- You got more of these?
- A million dollars?

758
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:45,047
I'm the guy.

759
00:50:45,723 --> 00:50:47,182
I got an appointment.
I gotta-

760
00:50:51,771 --> 00:50:52,601
Bullshit!

761
00:50:52,855 --> 00:50:54,266
LaPlante, you're under arrest!

762
00:50:54,523 --> 00:50:55,354
You have the right-

763
00:50:55,566 --> 00:50:58,022
Don't you know who I am?
Where I got the plastic?

764
00:50:58,236 --> 00:51:00,905
I got a million bucks
from the jet!

765
00:51:01,823 --> 00:51:03,899
Bullshit! I got a million bucks!

766
00:51:12,834 --> 00:51:15,372
One million dollars
to anonymous hero!

767
00:51:15,628 --> 00:51:19,875
One million bucks to angel
who saved 50 people takes off!

768
00:51:20,133 --> 00:51:24,925
Now, please! If your foot isn't a
size 1 OB, don't remain in line!

769
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:27,932
We're only looking for size 1 OB heroes!

770
00:51:28,183 --> 00:51:29,381
Me, a liar?
I'll kick your ass!

771
00:51:29,643 --> 00:51:31,552
It ain't just me saying you
ain't the hero!

772
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:34,095
Everybody in line
knows you're not the hero!

773
00:51:34,356 --> 00:51:35,980
That's a racist perspective.

774
00:51:36,233 --> 00:51:39,898
Assuming because something heroic
was done, a white man done it.

775
00:51:40,154 --> 00:51:43,155
A man with mud on his face
could be a man of any colour.

776
00:51:43,407 --> 00:51:45,779
Most likely was, which is true
in this case...

777
00:51:46,035 --> 00:51:47,410
...because it was me!

778
00:51:47,619 --> 00:51:49,327
With mud all over me!

779
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:50,778
Can you believe this?

780
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,910
There must be a thousand
phonies here after my reward!

781
00:51:54,168 --> 00:51:56,837
Miss Gayley! It's me!
The guy who saved your life!

782
00:51:57,088 --> 00:51:57,953
It's me, remember?

783
00:51:58,214 --> 00:52:01,665
<i>I'm only an 81 I2, but I wear
a 10 for comfort, I swear!</i>

784
00:52:01,884 --> 00:52:04,209
A cop's here
for you from robbery detail.

785
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:06,012
Inspector Dayton.
He wants you to call.

786
00:52:06,222 --> 00:52:07,467
- What about?
- I didn't ask.

787
00:52:07,723 --> 00:52:10,559
Call back and find out, okay?
I'm really busy!

788
00:52:18,526 --> 00:52:21,646
Bail in this matter will
remain at $5,000.

789
00:52:21,863 --> 00:52:22,894
Next!

790
00:52:23,114 --> 00:52:25,403
The Angel of Flight 104?
You're the angel-

791
00:52:25,658 --> 00:52:27,568
Angel? I didn't say angel.

792
00:52:27,827 --> 00:52:30,615
I gotta get over to the TV station
and get my million.

793
00:52:30,872 --> 00:52:33,363
- Mr. LaPlante-
- The People vs. LaPlante.

794
00:52:33,625 --> 00:52:35,368
That's me! I'm Mr. LaPlante!

795
00:52:35,585 --> 00:52:38,539
The D.A. is asking that
your bail be set...

796
00:52:38,797 --> 00:52:41,169
...at $25,000.
$25,000!

797
00:52:41,425 --> 00:52:43,334
Because you were arrested again.

798
00:52:43,593 --> 00:52:47,045
Twenty-five grand is peanuts! You
just gotta get me out to collect-

799
00:52:47,306 --> 00:52:50,840
Your honour! The prosecutor
wants $25,000 for bail.

800
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:53,806
You will be silent until
the court recognizes you.

801
00:52:54,062 --> 00:52:56,055
Fine by me.
I got no problem with that.

802
00:52:56,315 --> 00:52:58,770
In fact, your honour, I'd be
proud to double it.

803
00:52:59,026 --> 00:53:01,861
Fifty grand. For The People.
Like a tip.

804
00:53:02,863 --> 00:53:04,405
- Mr. LaPlante-
- What do you say?

805
00:53:04,657 --> 00:53:09,402
If you don't stop chattering
immediately, I will ask the bailiff-

806
00:53:18,212 --> 00:53:21,297
I said I want...

807
00:53:22,216 --> 00:53:23,711
...order!!

808
00:53:24,385 --> 00:53:26,508
- Sorry, sir.
- We got carried away.

809
00:53:26,763 --> 00:53:28,636
- They found him!
- Found who?

810
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:30,966
The Angel of Flight 104.

811
00:53:33,186 --> 00:53:35,594
It was on the news, sir.
Just now.

812
00:53:35,855 --> 00:53:38,773
He's gonna be on Channel 4 at noon.

813
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,194
We'll sustain the bail at $25,000.

814
00:53:44,447 --> 00:53:46,072
That ought to keep you
out of trouble.

815
00:53:46,283 --> 00:53:49,734
- Your honour, my client is-
- Your client is a pain in the ass!

816
00:53:49,995 --> 00:53:52,402
Twelve noon, huh? Channel 4.

817
00:54:05,135 --> 00:54:07,128
I was out in the woods...

818
00:54:10,724 --> 00:54:13,180
...and I heard a huge crash.

819
00:54:15,479 --> 00:54:17,602
And I saw...

820
00:54:17,815 --> 00:54:19,274
...flames.

821
00:54:19,525 --> 00:54:22,146
And I went over there
to take a look.

822
00:54:28,242 --> 00:54:30,864
And everything there was...

823
00:54:31,078 --> 00:54:32,786
...like a blur.

824
00:54:33,414 --> 00:54:35,739
There was a lot of smoke...

825
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,408
...and screaming.

826
00:54:42,882 --> 00:54:47,378
I was relieved that it was just
a plane crash, and I could help.

827
00:54:53,101 --> 00:54:56,968
But I don't have a detailed
memory of it. It was too scary.

828
00:54:57,564 --> 00:54:59,391
Tell us why you disappeared, John.

829
00:55:01,193 --> 00:55:02,817
<i>Well, that's-</i>

830
00:55:06,156 --> 00:55:09,490
<i>At first, I didn't know
I was the hero. I thought...</i>

831
00:55:10,327 --> 00:55:12,118
<i>...the boy's father hadn't survived...</i>

832
00:55:12,371 --> 00:55:15,537
<i>...and I had failed him
and I couldn't...</i>

833
00:55:15,749 --> 00:55:18,454
<i>I couldn't face the boy.
And then...</i>

834
00:55:22,589 --> 00:55:24,499
<i>...after that...</i>

835
00:55:24,758 --> 00:55:27,131
<i>...well, I've been...</i>

836
00:55:27,386 --> 00:55:30,340
<i>I've been down on my luck lately.</i>

837
00:55:31,557 --> 00:55:35,424
<i>I just didn't really feel
too presentable.</i>

838
00:55:35,686 --> 00:55:37,478
<i>But finally, you did come forward.</i>

839
00:55:38,439 --> 00:55:39,933
<i>Why?</i>

840
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:43,067
<i>The money.</i>

841
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:50,157
<i>I wouldn't have come forward
if it wasn't for...</i>

842
00:55:50,827 --> 00:55:53,069
<i>- ... if it wasn't for the money.
- Go back.</i>

843
00:55:56,624 --> 00:55:57,454
Cut!

844
00:55:57,709 --> 00:55:59,167
Right there.

845
00:55:59,419 --> 00:56:00,996
Right on that look.

846
00:56:01,421 --> 00:56:02,915
You didn't tell me he
was so cute.

847
00:56:07,344 --> 00:56:08,886
He saved my life.

848
00:56:11,514 --> 00:56:15,429
<i>The survivors were shocked to learn
that the hero who appeared...</i>

849
00:56:15,685 --> 00:56:17,512
<i>...and pulled them to safety
was indigent...</i>

850
00:56:17,771 --> 00:56:20,938
<i>...and hadn't slept in a bed
in more than three years.</i>

851
00:56:21,191 --> 00:56:24,560
<i>John Bubber was living in his car
at the time of the crash.</i>

852
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:27,655
<i>Eking out a meagre existence
by collecting cans...</i>

853
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:30,650
- He's a fake.
- You know him?

854
00:56:30,909 --> 00:56:33,116
He's a goddamn fake.
He's a bum.

855
00:56:33,328 --> 00:56:36,199
He's a goddamn homeless bum!

856
00:56:36,415 --> 00:56:39,369
He ain't no hero.
You can trust me on that.

857
00:56:39,627 --> 00:56:40,907
Trust you!

858
00:56:41,587 --> 00:56:43,745
What do you mean,
cutting down the homeless?

859
00:56:44,006 --> 00:56:46,628
What do you know about the homeless?

860
00:56:50,888 --> 00:56:55,218
You know, I thought they'd all go,
" It's him!" and wanna hug the guy.

861
00:56:55,810 --> 00:56:58,383
Relax. He had the shoe,
and the shoe checked out.

862
00:56:58,646 --> 00:57:01,730
I can stop worrying?
Where are we putting him up?

863
00:57:01,983 --> 00:57:04,438
Drake Hotel.
And never stop worrying.

864
00:57:04,694 --> 00:57:07,980
We'll do a sidebar on going from
sleeping in your car...

865
00:57:08,239 --> 00:57:10,148
...to sleeping in a posh suite.

866
00:57:10,408 --> 00:57:13,362
Also, Gale's checking into
his background.

867
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:16,075
What's it gonna be?
Dirt or more poetry?

868
00:57:16,331 --> 00:57:18,158
We know which one you'd prefer.

869
00:57:18,416 --> 00:57:21,086
Inspector Dayton recovered
your credit cards-

870
00:57:21,336 --> 00:57:24,254
- Who?
- Inspector Dayton, from robbery detail.

871
00:57:24,464 --> 00:57:27,251
They caught the guy
who stole your credit cards-

872
00:57:27,509 --> 00:57:29,632
Nobody stole them.
They were burned up.

873
00:57:29,886 --> 00:57:32,556
You got my money?
What about the reservations?

874
00:57:32,764 --> 00:57:35,469
Two at 8, at the Barcelona.

875
00:57:35,726 --> 00:57:40,055
- Four hundred dollars for dinner?
- She's taking Mr. Bubber to dinner.

876
00:57:40,314 --> 00:57:41,559
Bubber? To dinner?

877
00:57:41,815 --> 00:57:43,642
That's a great idea! Chucky!

878
00:57:43,901 --> 00:57:46,570
- Come in here.
- This is private and personal.

879
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:48,647
He's a news story, for Pete's sake.

880
00:57:48,906 --> 00:57:50,697
He saved my life.

881
00:59:47,527 --> 00:59:48,725
Thank you.

882
00:59:52,783 --> 00:59:55,784
- They're all looking at us.
- Not " us," John.

883
00:59:55,994 --> 00:59:57,536
They're used to celebrities.

884
00:59:57,746 --> 01:00:00,118
- Listen, Miss Gayley. I really-
- Gale.

885
01:00:02,793 --> 01:00:04,168
Gale...

886
01:00:05,295 --> 01:00:07,087
...I didn't mean to...

887
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:11,543
It's not what I wanted, that reward.
I didn't think-

888
01:00:11,927 --> 01:00:13,125
Thank you.

889
01:00:13,971 --> 01:00:16,509
All I wanted was a square meal,
maybe a bath...

890
01:00:16,765 --> 01:00:19,303
...clean sheets.
I wasn't after $1 million.

891
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:22,312
Twenty would've been fine.
Maybe fifty, but-

892
01:00:24,231 --> 01:00:27,102
What's a guy like me gonna do
with $1 million?

893
01:00:27,318 --> 01:00:29,192
Look at these prices
and say that.

894
01:00:32,615 --> 01:00:34,655
I'll cut your heart out and eat it!

895
01:00:34,867 --> 01:00:36,492
- Sit down, man!
- Get off of me!

896
01:00:36,702 --> 01:00:38,660
Oh, you're such a brute.

897
01:00:38,913 --> 01:00:42,163
Come on! You got some shit
to say to me? Come on!

898
01:00:42,417 --> 01:00:43,827
You're dead shit, mother-

899
01:00:44,085 --> 01:00:45,164
Very good, sir.

900
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:47,745
It's a special privilege to serve you.

901
01:00:48,006 --> 01:00:50,675
Oh, thank you. And you.

902
01:00:51,593 --> 01:00:53,632
You were saying you don't want
$1 million?

903
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:56,425
I'm not entitled to $1 million, Gale.

904
01:00:56,681 --> 01:00:58,425
I didn't expect-

905
01:00:58,683 --> 01:01:00,925
The adulation?
Makes you feel like a fake.

906
01:01:01,144 --> 01:01:03,053
I should've never come forward-

907
01:01:03,313 --> 01:01:05,685
You're a credit to
the goddamn human race.

908
01:01:05,941 --> 01:01:07,103
I wouldn't put it-

909
01:01:07,317 --> 01:01:09,689
It could've been me on that plane.

910
01:01:09,945 --> 01:01:11,522
Or my family.

911
01:01:12,573 --> 01:01:15,906
You're a celebrity now.
People are gonna want to please you...

912
01:01:16,118 --> 01:01:17,992
...or use you, or both.

913
01:01:24,710 --> 01:01:26,750
Mr. Bubber, can we get a statement?

914
01:01:30,591 --> 01:01:32,382
John, I think you're the greatest!

915
01:01:48,359 --> 01:01:49,522
Mr. Bubber?

916
01:01:51,029 --> 01:01:52,653
Do you think you could...

917
01:01:52,989 --> 01:01:54,483
...you could...?

918
01:01:55,783 --> 01:01:57,610
You want me to sign this?

919
01:01:59,287 --> 01:02:00,746
What's your name?

920
01:02:00,955 --> 01:02:03,446
- Sylvia.
- Sylvia?

921
01:02:04,959 --> 01:02:08,245
Sylvia, if I sign this for you,
will you do me a favour?

922
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:12,548
What I'd like is, and maybe...

923
01:02:13,552 --> 01:02:16,256
...some of the rest of you
could help Sylvia.

924
01:02:16,805 --> 01:02:19,296
I'd like you to scrounge up
some blankets...

925
01:02:20,225 --> 01:02:22,633
...old ones, maybe 50.

926
01:02:24,146 --> 01:02:27,230
Take them down to the corner
of Fifth and Grand.

927
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:29,229
Pass them out.

928
01:02:29,735 --> 01:02:31,359
- Fifth and Grand?
- Yes.

929
01:02:32,237 --> 01:02:33,435
He means the homeless.

930
01:02:34,114 --> 01:02:35,063
The bums.

931
01:02:35,366 --> 01:02:36,445
It's cold out there.

932
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:40,568
You'll feel warmer for every person
you give a blanket to.
