1
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,555
Before learning how to write
I was reciting poems.

2
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,800
Poetry gives meaning to my life.

3
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,589
I wouldn't change a verse
for anything in the world.

4
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,435
Entering a minefield forms
part of my artistic job.

5
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,636
It is a deep entrance into the trauma.

6
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,036
I think it is an issue of an extreme
feeling of guilt...

7
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,509
because I survived the war.

8
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,795
Although I'm in love with cinema,

9
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,668
for me it is mainly a medium.

10
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,230
I love my job and can't imagine
my life without it.

11
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,213
I'm convinced that risks have
to be taken to change things.

12
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,591
I believe that we, as women,

13
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,315
through the anti-military
and feminist struggle...

14
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,358
will save the world and
make men change.

15
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,638
Being a feminist requires opposition
to militarism...

16
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,998
because it is the last resort
of the patriarchy.

17
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:55,756
When we oppose repressive relationships
between women and men,

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,120
we also opposes militarism,

19
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,392
racism, capitalism...

20
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,996
The role of cinema and all arts
in a country like ours...

21
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,395
is totally different from the
role in developed countries.

22
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,870
We must use all the media...

23
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,876
to inform, to educate...

24
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,512
and expose all the issues
they prefer to keep silent.

25
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,628
I believe that all works of art
originate in a traumatic experience...

26
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,548
and end up in another one.

27
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,838
I'm only trying to find the way out.

28
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,753
I love reading my own poetry
and other people's.

29
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:16,671
For me poetry is like worshipping God

30
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,350
I would give my life
for a poem.

31
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,355
Walking and pinpointing minefields
around Sarajevo,

32
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,375
looking for a place where we could
continue our lives...

33
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,958
we found an old Muslim cemetery...

34
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,032
from the XVI century,
marked as a minefield,

35
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,150
which some children had turned
into a football pitch.

36
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,750
This released my deepest trauma...

37
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:40,410
as I realized that life is energy
which flows like water.

38
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,350
When you enter a minefield

39
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,672
and risk your life for others...

40
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,629
there are a lot of moments
which remain in your mind.

41
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,356
You enter a space where you
are completely conscious...

42
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,149
and where one minute seems like a year.

43
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,593
In my opinion a minefield
is an example of something...

44
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,192
created by man...

45
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,431
without being aware that...

46
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,831
in the end it would turn against him.

47
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,669
As when explosives, the Atomic Bomb,
and other things were created...

48
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,913
which turned against him.

49
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,830
It is incredible how far
we can go with our creations.

50
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,354
Everyone coming into Sarajevo
used to see us as victims,

51
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,158
and they still do.

52
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,878
I told myself: I'm not a victim,
I don't want to be a victim,

53
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,118
I want to do something for myself.

54
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,217
After the war I started to think about
what I could do for my country.

55
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,236
I started clearing minefields.

56
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,198
And by doing this
I felt I had the right to speak.

57
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,155
Then I gathered some of the earth
that I had cleared...

58
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,677
and took it with me wherever I went.

59
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,511
She is selling the earth
from the minefields...

60
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,830
to collect funds in order
to continue de-mining.

61
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,795
WARSAW

62
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,517
ROME

63
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,116
VALENCIA

64
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:55,796
To Warsaw, Valencia,
Rome, Slavonski Brod,

65
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,072
to all the exhibitions
I was invited to...

66
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,068
and where my work was needed.

67
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,631
When someone wants to be an artist
because they cannot let...

68
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,714
what's going on around
them stay the same...

69
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,076
achieving fame in the world of...

70
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:25,950
art becomes unimportant.

71
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,031
While selling the earth
I wanted to ask people...

72
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,549
if when they bought a work of art...

73
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,477
they were sure
of what they were buying.

74
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,354
If they were able to pay millions
for a Picasso...

75
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:48,111
and afterwards delete his signature
and put their own in.

76
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,689
How can they think of buying
a minefield or a work of art?

77
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,589
How do they think they can buy
this feeling?

78
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:11,512
I wanted to create
a bigger space for mankind...

79
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,719
turning something negative
into something positive,

80
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,315
so that we can live without daily
limitations imposed by this space...

81
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,316
and we can express ourselves freely.

82
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,595
What have you written Alma?

83
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,713
One song.

84
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,759
It is in a medieval language.

85
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,030
They're talking about one girl...

86
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,437
she was a soldier...

87
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,435
Pushed by the love she had
for her brother...

88
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,751
she left her small village
and followed him to war.

89
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,912
The battlefield filled
her with horror...

90
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,560
but when the war ended...

91
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,108
she stayed to cultivate the land.

92
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,754
Since I was a child I had this image
of being at a shop window.

93
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,152
And I still like this idea,
maybe this is why I like cinema so much.

94
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,109
I had recurring dreams of a glass table.

95
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,069
And like in the shop window,
I could see everybody.

96
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,158
This dream continued every night.

97
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,213
I could see all the people
I loved from above...

98
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,518
and observe what was happening
in their lives.

99
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,812
Now I understand the significance of
this dream whereas before I didn't.

100
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,373
This is the point of view I follow in my
cinema: Look, observe and discover.

101
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,915
No, he wasn't that good looking.

102
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,118
Have you given me the right
telephone number?

103
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,430
How do you say "administration"
in English?

104
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,670
The line was cut off!

105
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,236
"Beautiful" and rich, very rich.

106
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,355
Now I'm gonna say "hello" to everyone.

107
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,197
Film this!

108
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,879
This is like a scene from "Under the
Skin of the city" Isn't it, Rakhshan?

109
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,557
- Do you remember?
- Yes, yes...

110
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,191
Shooting!

111
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,712
Fix your scarf, cover your hair!

112
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,593
Actually, there isn't a written law.

113
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,993
Sometimes instructions are given...

114
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:48,951
with concrete prohibitions.

115
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,193
But there are things we already know,

116
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:01,473
such as the prohibition of physical
contact in public...

117
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:06,793
or a woman without a headscarf.

118
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,832
- Is Ali at home?
- He left and I didn't notice.

119
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,913
- Come to bed.
- I'll sleep in my own bed.

120
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,629
I always try to find
a way to say what I want...

121
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,637
and instead of skirting the limits
I fly over them.

122
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,273
A girl has just got into the car. She
wants to film but we don't know what.

123
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,155
Hush, girls, the police.

124
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,796
Be quiet, there's a Mr. Basiji.

125
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,677
Shut up!

126
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,352
Follow that one!

127
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,396
Basiji has got on a motorbike.

128
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,948
Girls, I swear by the holy book
that he's going to create a problem.

129
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,070
No, we'll say that a foreigner's riding
with us and she wants to shoot a film.

130
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,350
"Good boy"

131
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,795
When they detain us you'll understand.

132
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,350
The majority of the laws we have...

133
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,574
have no relation to the thoughts
nor the needs of the Iranian youth.

134
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:27,392
That's why they have become a
reactive generation.

135
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,751
Living in a society of men,

136
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,878
between tradition and modemity
is difficult for everyone,

137
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,629
but for the young it's a lot harder.

138
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:53,031
We thought that the revolution
would allow...

139
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,271
many of the claims we...

140
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:01,394
shared with people of different
ideologies to come true.

141
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:07,672
You can't deny that a lot
of things changed...

142
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,569
and this was natural after such
a huge transformation.

143
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,919
But I think that the changes which
occurred after the revolution...

144
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,910
didn't meet the expectations we had.

145
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:30,113
Justice, liberty. Iran for
all the Iranians

146
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,878
"Shut up"

147
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,513
Be Quiet, the policeman
Basiji is following us.

148
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,511
Yes, Yes it's true,
he got on a motorbike.

149
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,232
Marjan, Marjan, he's coming.

150
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,075
We were only laughing among ourselves.

151
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,471
Go a little slower.

152
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:21,278
The female characters in my films
are based on people around me,

153
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,749
but none of them exist
in the real world.

154
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,349
There is a connection between the women
I met during the process of research...

155
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:53,572
and what you see in my films is
the image of their distinct situations.

156
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:01,119
That's why a lot of people...

157
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:05,239
from different social extractions...

158
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:09,196
feel identified in my films.

159
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,474
- Where is my picture?
- It's here

160
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,633
- how ugly I am!
- No, you're pretty

161
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,390
Wow, how ugly he is!

162
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,914
Every time I think about the past,

163
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,278
it is not only my family that
comes into mind...

164
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,132
but also all the characters in my films.

165
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,189
The conflicts that I've had with
them are always with me.

166
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,959
Unfortunately, my hands are too small...

167
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,873
to take the world into my arms.

168
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,992
We have a problem in Turkey:

169
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:31,234
The military repress Muslims
because of their religion.

170
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,035
I'm as much against de-veiling
a woman by force...

171
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,758
as veiling her by force.

172
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,717
That's why I'm supporting the
demonstrations of the women in veil.

173
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,354
And I'm for legalizing the use
of the veil at the university.

174
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:47,311
What worries me is the military
control on people's beliefs.

175
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:53,316
In Turkey, politics are polarized...

176
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,592
and we're made to believe
there is no other choice.

177
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,592
The military say: "if we leave,
Islamists will replace us",

178
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,558
And the Islamists say the opposite.

179
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,757
I have been interested in politics
since my childhood,

180
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:21,709
In my high school years I was
part of the leftist movement.

181
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,917
But I realised that there
was no great difference...

182
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,438
between the dominant ideology
and the alternative groups.

183
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,917
After graduating, I found the
human rights Defence organization.

184
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,514
I observed them for two years and
in 1989 I started to work with them.

185
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,399
In this institution, hierarchical
questions between women and men...

186
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,552
are at a minimum,

187
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:57,695
though I can't say that
they don't exist.

188
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,074
As defenders of human rights...

189
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,350
we find this TV programme
to be very harmful.

190
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,474
It presents violence against women
as something trivial.

191
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:17,240
They show these aggressions as
something normal.

192
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,837
I've been a lawyer for 20 years.

193
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,912
I've always defended
political and torture cases.

194
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,935
But when in 1995 I was jailed in a cell
with my clients,

195
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,953
I found out that they faced
a form of torture...

196
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,878
that nobody had ever
told me about before.

197
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:42,512
All of them had faced sexual
harassment and some had been raped.

198
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,512
Then, I started to think
what we could do about it.

199
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,593
We got together and
organized our office.

200
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:56,756
Our aim is to encourage women
to seek their own solutions.

201
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,390
It is very hard for them
to talk about it.

202
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,532
Always the same answer to the question
of why they don't denounce this:

203
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,553
Because I don't want
to upset my father"

204
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,154
But then again I've never met a woman...

205
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,389
worried about upsetting her mother.

206
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:21,753
Both the penal and civil code of
the Turkish constitution...

207
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,389
are very patriarchal.

208
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:29,669
The articles on violence against women
are grouped together in the chapter...

209
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,873
crimes against Public
Morality and Family".

210
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,475
The law has changed, but in practice
it remains the same.

211
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,394
Women are still considered to
be a part of a man's honour.

212
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,076
Why do you sacrifice
animals at Bayram?

213
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,515
Because Muslims sacrifice
animals on this day.

214
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,273
Tell us the story...

215
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,753
- Explain it?
- Yes.

216
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,838
- You want to hear the story?
- Yes, tell it to us.

217
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:05,250
In the time of our Prophet...

218
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,110
The Prophet was about to sacrifice
his son, but God sent a lamb instead.

219
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:21,151
His knife wouldn't cut, so God
sent a lamb for him to sacrifice.

220
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,833
The Prophet consecrated his son,
but God sent him a lamb.

221
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,154
Stop, calm down.

222
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,029
Do you accept me as your butcher?
Do you? Do you?

223
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:40,238
"God is great. "

224
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,797
"God is great.

225
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,189
And he is full of mercy. "

226
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:58,993
I think not only Islam but all
other religions are patriarchal...

227
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,878
and try to control women.

228
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:40,795
This is all down to the roles that
have been assigned to us;

229
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,469
They're well served; everything
they want is done by women.

230
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,918
Of course, they don't want a woman
who says: "no, I won't serve you!"

231
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:56,392
It's a socially sexist point of view.

232
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:02,237
They learned it from their fathers, and
practice it without questioning it.

233
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:20,229
Since 1991, the Turkish revenge Group...

234
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,356
has been threatening me...

235
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,292
as well as a lot of other people
who work in human rights.

236
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:33,353
Just after the threats started,
14 members were killed.

237
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,590
I was held at gunpoint in
Diyarbakir in 1994...

238
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,915
but it was only to frighten me.

239
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,352
Now, I know that I might be killed.
But I'm used to it.

240
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:50,718
My greatest fear is to lose
the ones I love.

241
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,951
This affects me every day.

242
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,729
Besides this, I'm threatened
and naturally feel scared.

243
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,233
I try not to get home late,
I don't walk alone at night,

244
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,517
I check all the locks...

245
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:12,396
Sometimes at night they ring my bell
constantly to frighten me.

246
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:17,236
They call me by phone and say they're
close to my home and coming.

247
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:22,157
It's like death is always by my side.

248
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,550
When somebody gets
out of jail and hugs me,

249
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,236
or when a torture victim...

250
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,676
says they are no longer
scared because I'm with them,

251
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,912
I feel something that not
many people can feel.

252
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,231
These feelings give me strength.

253
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,550
That's why I've never regretted
my choice of line of work.

254
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:14,649
From what I've read in the news about
you, I think that you're very brave.

255
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,949
Are you really that brave?

256
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,112
I don't know if I'm that brave...

257
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,875
but it's a fact that we run more
risks than a lot of other people.

258
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,190
I don't want to speak just
for myself because...

259
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,835
as a human rights defender,
I'm not alone.

260
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:38,193
When you believe in what you do,
you accept living in fear.

261
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:01,033
"We're her workmates and
we want her to sing a song. "

262
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,873
"We insist". They have written that.

263
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,633
I knew they would do this to me.

264
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,348
You went to the conservatory,
so you know how to sing.

265
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,230
I wonder which song they
want me to sing.

266
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,950
They didn't ask for any specific song...

267
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:35,159
but we would prefer "My brave, my lion".

268
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,916
I love this song,

269
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:44,712
it's always sung in honour of the
murdered journalist Ugur Mumcu.

270
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,850
"The tiny home town roads

271
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:03,275
"he cannot use his hands because of pain

272
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,675
"These tiny roads of my birthplace

273
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,872
"he cannot use his hands due to pain

274
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,970
"he was convicted and not a soul
heard about it.

275
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,213
"My brave, my lion rests in peace.

276
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,657
"He was convicted and not a
soul heard about it.

277
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,259
"My brave, my lion rests in peace"

278
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:12,911
In the name of God, I am Moshgan
and I live in Herat next to a river.

279
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,438
I have eight sisters.
Three of them are married...

280
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,193
and are teachers.

281
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:27,470
Another makes documentaries,
and another one makes movies.

282
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:31,633
My sister Omeira paints
beautiful paintings,

283
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:36,271
and I have another sister
who loves music.

284
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,873
"What a strange land my country is!

285
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:48,717
"Can you believe that when you
sow a seed you collect bullets?

286
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,031
"How late we dream about another birth.

287
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:56,655
"Do you remember those days when
we could conquer hearts with a smile?

288
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,592
"Do you remember those days
when my white...

289
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,070
"ribbons adorned my mother's prayers?

290
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,955
"Oh, oh... me and my land.

291
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:19,230
"We have both lost our reflexes.

292
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:25,550
I have always lived in Afghanistan.

293
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:29,490
Since childhood I've been
surrounded by war.

294
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:36,916
I don't have any good memories,
not even of school,

295
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:44,234
because school was forbidden
and we had to go in secret.

296
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,579
Everything was forbidden
during the Taliban period.

297
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:06,351
Women were not allowed to walk on
the streets without a man.

298
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:10,556
As we don't have a brother,
one of us had to dress as a boy,

299
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:18,352
so she could go to the bazaar
and do the shopping.

300
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:21,429
I wore boys' clothes because that way...

301
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:29,920
I could go out to get what we needed...

302
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,635
and help my father outside the house.

303
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,313
Once, at the bazaar,

304
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:45,508
prayer time arrived.

305
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,211
We had to go to the mosque,

306
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,711
The guards used to hit and
force people to pray.

307
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:05,030
In the mosque I saw that everyone was
staring at me with accusing eyes.

308
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,237
When I came out, I told my father...

309
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:14,356
and I realized that it was due
to the way I held my hands:

310
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,149
I was praying like a woman.

311
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,234
That was the most
horrible experience in my life.

312
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:48,635
"Instead of hiding behind the veil
looking for riddles...

313
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,873
"look for the path that takes you
to the hidden treasures. "

314
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:58,478
"Instead of hiding behind the veil
looking for riddles...

315
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:02,917
"look for the path that takes you
to the hidden treasures. "

316
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,668
Women and girls who
live in Afghanistan...

317
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,275
have very few opportunities
to make use of their talent.

318
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:21,592
Most of them get married.

319
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,638
I don't have anything against marriage.

320
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,188
The problem is that many women...

321
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,238
cannot continue studying afterwards.

322
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,600
The husband's family or even the husband
himself won't let them.

323
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:40,390
The women surrender without a fight.

324
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,553
What I'm saying is that women
must see if, after marriage,

325
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,679
they will have the opportunity
to study and improve.

326
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:21,999
"The legends are ash,

327
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:27,189
"the valleys narrow until
they become ravines,

328
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:31,353
"we have sung to the mirror,
in these claustrophobic times

329
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,958
"oh, the faces have turned into stones!"

330
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:43,760
We must work to be more useful...

331
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:52,118
and we have to do our best to build
our country and become self sufficient.

332
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:57,433
Those who are educated have
to work even harder.

333
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:01,399
It is important to live this way.

334
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:06,918
If our work becomes
a routine over time,

335
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:10,689
we have to do everything possible
to get over this feeling...

336
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,951
and continue being useful
to our community.

337
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,791
If we live with this goal...

338
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,495
we will make the best of
every moment...

339
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,878
"If I stop walking, call me stone.

340
