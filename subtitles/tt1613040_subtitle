00:04:25,995 --> 00:04:26,962
Who is responsible?

27
00:04:27,063 --> 00:04:28,553
We're suspecting naxals..

28
00:04:28,664 --> 00:04:29,562
Crude bombs were used..

29
00:04:29,665 --> 00:04:32,156
Nobody has claimed responsibility
till now lnvestigation is going on..

30
00:04:32,735 --> 00:04:33,702
Any other casualties?

00:04:34,403 --> 00:04:36,098
Five Security personnel..

32
00:04:41,043 --> 00:04:42,271

00:04:42,378 --> 00:04:43,208
They're downstairs..

By the way, where is Arjun?

43
00:05:18,347 --> 00:05:20,247
Sir.. what about the government now?

00:05:21,016 --> 00:05:22,847
ls this the time to ask that?
Move..

45
00:05:25,654 --> 00:05:27,884
While on his way back from Srisailam..

46
00:05:28,591 --> 00:05:30,752
What's the Home minister upto?
Meetings.. making statements..

47
00:05:30,993 --> 00:05:32,620
We should snub him..

48
00:05:33,796 --> 00:05:35,093
Where are our supporters?

49
00:05:35,331 --> 00:05:38,698
l can hardly see 1000 of them..
l don't know how you do it

50
00:05:38,868 --> 00:05:40,495
ln another hour.. l want to

00:05:46,075 --> 00:05:49,374
l mean.. Two times ''long live CM''
Three times my name

54
00:05:49,745 --> 00:05:51,303
-Will be done..
-Tell!

55
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,504
All the newspapers
should carry the headlines as..

56
00:05:52,748 --> 00:05:55,979
CM Bomblast..
Next CM Dhanunjay..

57
00:05:56,318 --> 00:05:57,114
-Okay?
-Okay..

58
00:05:57,219 --> 00:06:01,588
Long live CM..

59
00:06:04,226 --> 00:06:05,921
CM's wife is Rajeshwari..

60
00:06:06,095 --> 00:06:10,327
His only son Arjun Prasad stays
in S.S.A, away from politics

61
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,592
Long live CM..

62
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:18,137
Long live CM's son..

63
00:06:33,155 --> 00:06:35,715
Long live CM..

64
00:06:36,158 --> 00:06:37,125
Mom..

65
00:06:48,838 --> 00:06:51,602
Mom.. it's okay.. okay..
you sit down..

66
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,872
you sit down..

67
00:06:57,947 --> 00:07:00,507
-Arjun.. don't know what's going on..
-He'll be fine..

68
00:07:00,683 --> 00:07:01,581
Something is wrong..

69
00:07:02,618 --> 00:07:03,778
They're saying he's critical..

70
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,312
but, not giving any details..

71
00:07:05,488 --> 00:07:08,855
Apart from CM's critical condition..

72
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,392
The other issue which is being strongly
debated in the political circles is..

73
00:07:11,494 --> 00:07:12,927
Who will be the next CM?

74
00:07:13,028 --> 00:07:14,723
let's ask our bureau chief's
opinion on this..

75
00:07:16,832 --> 00:07:18,732
Home Minister and Deputy CM are together..

76
00:07:19,368 --> 00:07:20,733
They are planning a meeting..

77
00:07:21,036 --> 00:07:22,264
You talk to Peddaina..

78
00:07:22,371 --> 00:07:26,205
ask him to declare you as
the lnterim CHlEF MlNlSTER..

79
00:07:32,448 --> 00:07:34,814
Dhanu is hardly 30 years..
How can he be a CM?

80
00:07:35,184 --> 00:07:37,015
And for how long that
family will be ruling the state?

81
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,680
You should talk to him..

82
00:07:41,257 --> 00:07:42,781
ln the current situation..

83
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:46,325
Only Dhanunjay seems to have
the best chance of becoming a CM..

84
00:07:46,428 --> 00:07:48,862
He's a usless fellow..
How can Dhanu be a CM?

85
00:07:49,031 --> 00:07:50,726
Who will support him?

86
00:07:51,767 --> 00:07:53,132
-We'll support him..
-What?

87
00:07:53,569 --> 00:07:55,127
Provided you guys are made ministers..

88
00:07:56,505 --> 00:07:58,336
Having an usless CM is good for us..

89
00:07:58,507 --> 00:08:02,068
we can get more cabinet berths..
and we can get our work done..

90
00:08:02,645 --> 00:08:04,408
-Hello Peddaina..
-Tell me

91
00:08:04,914 --> 00:08:07,212
Home Minister and Deputy CM
are scheming something..

92
00:08:07,383 --> 00:08:09,681
That's common in politics..

93
00:08:10,185 --> 00:08:12,278
They'll definitely try to
exploit the situation..

94
00:08:12,922 --> 00:08:13,752
You're as well doing the same..

95
00:08:13,923 --> 00:08:15,220
You'll have to take care of them..

96
00:08:15,391 --> 00:08:16,881
Yes.. l am on my way..

97
00:08:17,059 --> 00:08:18,083
Come fast.. See you..

98
00:08:30,506 --> 00:08:32,303
The worsening health
condition of the CM,..

99
00:08:32,408 --> 00:08:34,774
..has pushed the state
into political uncertainty..

100
00:08:35,044 --> 00:08:38,138
And political analysts believe that,
the arrival of ''PEOPLES' PARTY''..

101
00:08:38,247 --> 00:08:40,340
..President MAHADEVAYYA,
will put an end to it..

102
00:08:40,482 --> 00:08:44,009
lt is believed that, he'll either persuade
or intimidate Munuswamy,..

103
00:08:44,119 --> 00:08:47,555
..Home Minister and
Deputy CM to keep them in check..

104
00:08:47,656 --> 00:08:49,283
Sir.. What about our portfolios?

105
00:08:51,327 --> 00:08:52,555
l'll take care of them.. okay

106
00:08:56,065 --> 00:08:58,090
Now go and handle the media..

107
00:08:58,267 --> 00:09:02,033
Say that investigation is on and
we'll get hold of the people involved..

108
00:09:02,137 --> 00:09:03,627
Come on move..

109
00:09:04,206 --> 00:09:07,232
-What's with you?
-Me as interm CM?

110
00:09:09,745 --> 00:09:10,769
Where is Arjun?

111
00:09:18,921 --> 00:09:20,013
Don't worry..

112
00:09:20,923 --> 00:09:22,891
These things are common in politics..

113
00:09:23,859 --> 00:09:24,757
Rajamma..

114
00:09:26,328 --> 00:09:27,352
Sit down..

115
00:09:29,531 --> 00:09:33,126
Be strong and take care of yourself..

116
00:09:33,602 --> 00:09:35,900
You don't seem to have eaten anything..

117
00:09:36,772 --> 00:09:38,069
Get something for her to eat

118
00:09:38,273 --> 00:09:40,241
-Sncle..
-Get some breakfast..

119
00:09:41,143 --> 00:09:45,102
Be strong and take care of mom..

120
00:09:45,481 --> 00:09:47,642
Doctor.. What's his condition?

121
00:09:49,151 --> 00:09:50,778
He is still in coma sir.

122
00:09:50,953 --> 00:09:52,318
We've stopped the bleeding..

123
00:09:52,421 --> 00:09:54,321
But, we're still removing
the metal pieces..

124
00:09:54,957 --> 00:09:56,857
Snless he gets out of coma,
We can't say anything sir..

125
00:09:58,827 --> 00:10:00,158
Haven't you heard it?

126
00:10:00,262 --> 00:10:01,559
-Press conference is going on..
-Ok..!

127
00:10:01,664 --> 00:10:03,097
-Go and give this information to them..
-Okay..

128
00:10:03,265 --> 00:10:04,232
Sit down

129
00:10:06,268 --> 00:10:08,759
-Before Peddaina leaves.. Tell him,
we have an all party meeting.. -Ok..

130
00:10:08,871 --> 00:10:09,838
Are you blind?

131
00:10:10,606 --> 00:10:13,370
Rajamma..
You don't worry..

132
00:10:13,676 --> 00:10:14,643
lt's the PM's call..

133
00:10:15,411 --> 00:10:16,435
Greetings sir!

134
00:10:26,422 --> 00:10:27,514
Mom.. do you want to eat anything?

135
00:10:37,232 --> 00:10:38,859
Mr.Sanjeevaiah is a great leader..

136
00:10:39,768 --> 00:10:42,862
He's loved and adored
by all the people of our state..

137
00:10:43,172 --> 00:10:45,504
How can anyone think of assassinating him?

138
00:10:45,607 --> 00:10:48,701
lt's not important, whether it's
terrorists or naxals behind this..

139
00:10:48,811 --> 00:10:50,244
What's important is..

140
00:10:50,345 --> 00:10:51,642
Why have they done this?

141
00:10:51,747 --> 00:10:54,648
He's a great leader, who's been
working for us and for the country..

142
00:10:56,885 --> 00:10:59,046
-Sir..
-Why did they attack him?

143
00:10:59,421 --> 00:11:01,389
ls this the time to ask about
the next government?

Please may l have a word
with you for a minute?

That property is stuck in a court case..

To get it cleared from the case..
l had given him the money..

156
00:11:37,292 --> 00:11:40,591
After this attack on him,
l don't know what to do..

157
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,729

-Long live Dhanunjay..
-Wait Arjun..

183
00:12:50,465 --> 00:12:51,397
Water please..

184
00:12:52,601 --> 00:12:55,035
Give me a minute..
Let's go..

185
00:12:55,137 --> 00:12:57,435
Dhanu.. A guy out there is saying
he had given some money to dad..

186
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,632
l mean bribe

187
00:12:59,741 --> 00:13:00,639
Who?

188
00:13:00,809 --> 00:13:02,367
Don't know.. He was talking
about some property dispute..

189
00:13:02,477 --> 00:13:03,876
He seems to be troubled..

190
00:13:04,446 --> 00:13:05,344
How much did he say?

191
00:13:05,447 --> 00:13:06,345
10 crores..

192
00:13:08,317 --> 00:13:11,013
He must be bluffing..
You don't bother..

193
00:13:11,186 --> 00:13:12,676
just have a word with him..

194
00:13:14,256 --> 00:13:15,621
Why are you worried?

195
00:13:15,724 --> 00:13:16,622
You don't worry about him..

196
00:13:16,725 --> 00:13:19,159
These things are common for us..
l'll take care of him.. Okay

197
00:13:20,329 --> 00:13:21,887
Someone says he has paid money.
You take care of the guy..

198
00:13:21,997 --> 00:13:22,895
Okay..

199
00:13:22,998 --> 00:13:23,896
See you Arjun..

200
00:13:29,271 --> 00:13:31,239
CM is out of coma..
Please come sir..

201
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,050
Dad..

202
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:44,917
Dad..

203
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,767
Tell me dad..

204
00:14:00,602 --> 00:14:04,971
l want you to be the next CM..

205
00:14:07,276 --> 00:14:08,903
-Me?
-Yes!

206
00:14:23,492 --> 00:14:27,451
Dad..

207
00:14:30,098 --> 00:14:32,066
Dad..

208
00:14:50,352 --> 00:14:53,116
Our Great leader and Chief Minister
of the state Mr.Sanjeevayya..

209
00:14:53,221 --> 00:14:55,314
At around 1 :30 this afternoon..

210
00:14:55,424 --> 00:14:57,858
Our Great leader and Chief Minister
of the state Mr.Sanjeevayya..

211
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,325
Passed away..

212
00:15:03,765 --> 00:15:07,462
May Sanjeevaiah rest in peace..
May Sanjeevaiah rest in peace..

213
00:15:07,569 --> 00:15:11,665
May Sanjeevaiah rest in peace..

214
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:21,374
May Sanjeevaiah rest in peace..

215
00:15:21,483 --> 00:15:26,318
May Sanjeevaiah rest in peace..

216
00:15:44,973 --> 00:15:45,871
What's it Srikanth?

217
00:15:46,108 --> 00:15:48,269
CM has left some cash with me..

218
00:15:49,177 --> 00:15:50,610
-Should l inform Arjun?
-How much?

219
00:15:50,712 --> 00:15:51,940
Around.. 500 crores..

220
00:15:52,047 --> 00:15:53,947
Give 200 crore rupees to Arjun..
Keep the rest with you..

221
00:16:23,111 --> 00:16:23,941
Sncle..

222
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,415
ls everything done?

223
00:16:30,852 --> 00:16:31,682
just wanted to let you know..

224
00:16:33,455 --> 00:16:35,753
Thought it might be helpful
for your future plans..

225
00:16:36,525 --> 00:16:40,825
Dad has left about 50 crores in cash..

226
00:16:40,929 --> 00:16:44,092
..and more than 100 acres
of his property with me..

227
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:46,497
Sncle, you don't need to tell
these things to me now..

228
00:16:46,601 --> 00:16:48,091
lt's my responsibility
to let you know..

229
00:16:48,203 --> 00:16:49,966
You'll anyway leave to S.S..

230
00:16:50,072 --> 00:16:52,734
l am saying so that, you can convert
everything into cash and take it..

231
00:16:52,841 --> 00:16:54,934
lt's okay..
Calm down..

232
00:16:56,111 --> 00:16:58,011
l can understand your state of mind now..

233
00:16:58,313 --> 00:17:00,873
But, lt's his property and
you are his rightful heir..

234
00:17:00,982 --> 00:17:02,813
Moreover, it is my responsibility
to give it to you..

235
00:17:02,918 --> 00:17:04,613
Hope you understand..

236
00:17:06,721 --> 00:17:07,688
Okay..

237
00:17:09,057 --> 00:17:10,149
l'll leave now..

238
00:17:23,205 --> 00:17:24,433
This is dad's personal diary..

239
00:17:28,877 --> 00:17:33,507
lt's 1500 crores, he's given to uncle..

240
00:17:35,283 --> 00:17:38,081
None of them who gave
you money are honest..

241
00:17:42,858 --> 00:17:46,089
They gave you money because,
they are scared of Dhanu..

242
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,490
20,000 crores?

243
00:17:54,269 --> 00:17:56,294
Mom, dad has 20,000 crores?

244
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,505
Was he so corrupt?

245
00:17:59,608 --> 00:18:01,098
lt's not dad alone..

246
00:18:01,943 --> 00:18:03,911
The whole system is corrupt..

247
00:18:05,013 --> 00:18:06,503
He was just a small pawn in the system..

248
00:18:07,415 --> 00:18:09,645
He conspired and played his game..

249
00:18:10,085 --> 00:18:12,053
But, he couldn't change
the rules of the game..

250
00:18:13,421 --> 00:18:15,787
Within 2 years of coming into power..

251
00:18:15,891 --> 00:18:17,654
He lost his honesty and
became part of this system..

252
00:18:18,894 --> 00:18:20,452
He literally created criminals..

253
00:18:21,696 --> 00:18:23,960
To counter Dhanu.. He brought in
Deputy CM and to counter him..

254
00:18:24,065 --> 00:18:25,965
He brought in Home Minister..

255
00:18:26,067 --> 00:18:30,436
And when they started looting..
he couldn't do anything..

256
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:33,633
lnstead, he himself started looting..

257
00:18:34,676 --> 00:18:36,507
Does Peddaina know this?

258
00:18:37,145 --> 00:18:38,908
He knows but, he's not bothered..

259
00:18:39,548 --> 00:18:42,108
Because, he's egoistic and casteist..

260
00:18:42,284 --> 00:18:45,845
He wants only his family
members to rule the state..

261
00:18:45,954 --> 00:18:49,583
But, he's not bothered
about their governence..

262
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:53,594
Even if he knows that Dhanu
might have got his brother killed..

263
00:18:53,695 --> 00:18:54,855
He'll not do anything..

264
00:18:54,963 --> 00:18:56,863
And He'll not allow anybody else
to become a CM..

265
00:18:57,165 --> 00:18:58,189
Except you..

266
00:19:00,769 --> 00:19:02,134
Only you have that chance..

267
00:19:02,571 --> 00:19:04,539
As his son, you've that chance..

268
00:19:04,639 --> 00:19:05,799
That's why l am saying..

269
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,502
l'll talk to Peddaina..

270
00:19:12,347 --> 00:19:13,575
l want you to become the CM..

271
00:19:14,749 --> 00:19:16,580
Change the rules of this game..

272
00:19:17,219 --> 00:19:18,516
Dad couldn't do it..

273
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,650
You do it..

274
00:19:21,022 --> 00:19:21,886
Look..!

275
00:19:23,225 --> 00:19:25,785
He wanted to destroy corruption..

276
00:19:25,894 --> 00:19:28,522
..and the caste system..

277
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:31,997
He had lot of plans..

278
00:19:33,101 --> 00:19:34,591
But, he couldn't do anything..

279
00:19:38,506 --> 00:19:39,996
People are dying..

280
00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:42,809
They've lost hope in politicians..

281
00:19:44,713 --> 00:19:47,546
Give them a small hope, Arjun..

282
00:19:50,719 --> 00:19:52,880
lt was the most shameful day of my life..

283
00:19:53,588 --> 00:19:55,385
lt was a petty village dispute
lt was blown out of proportion..

284
00:19:56,558 --> 00:19:59,527
And soon escalated into a war
between Peddaina and the dalits..

285
00:20:00,562 --> 00:20:02,325
He was so infuriated that,

286
00:20:02,764 --> 00:20:04,527
He set the whole village on fire..

287
00:20:05,233 --> 00:20:06,860
Peddaina.. let's compromise

288
00:20:07,569 --> 00:20:08,934
You want me to compromise with them..

289
00:20:09,037 --> 00:20:11,801
You are a CM..
Are you not ashamed to say that?

290
00:20:12,374 --> 00:20:15,207
just take everybody
and get out from here..

291
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,208
l don't want anyone here..

292
00:20:16,311 --> 00:20:17,209
Peddaina..

293
00:20:17,379 --> 00:20:18,869
This is not good for the government..

294
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,277
People will not forgive us..

295
00:20:20,782 --> 00:20:22,147
You keep quiet thinking that

296
00:20:22,584 --> 00:20:24,211
They are so agitated

297
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:26,150
They'll attack our families tomorrow..

298
00:20:26,254 --> 00:20:29,815
just resign if you can't manage..
l'll make Dhanu a CM..

299
00:20:31,126 --> 00:20:32,218
At that moment..

300
00:20:32,527 --> 00:20:35,087
lf l had asked the chief of police
to take strong action..

301
00:20:35,196 --> 00:20:40,395
May be, l would've put an end to this
lawlessness in the name of caste, forever..

302
00:20:40,568 --> 00:20:41,728
But l didn't dare do it..

303
00:20:42,037 --> 00:20:44,267
Fearing the wrath of Peddaina..

304
00:20:45,106 --> 00:20:47,472
For a loan of 1000 crores..

305
00:20:47,575 --> 00:20:50,544
We had to kneel before the world bank..

306
00:20:51,246 --> 00:20:53,874
lnstead, if we had tried
unearthing the black money..

307
00:20:54,382 --> 00:20:57,943
We would have retrived 1 lakh crores,
within one year in our state alone..

308
00:20:58,053 --> 00:20:59,486
But, we didn't do it..

309
00:21:00,388 --> 00:21:02,618
Because we were spineless..
Politics is all about money..

310
00:21:02,724 --> 00:21:04,021
lt's all about buying and
selling people for power..

311
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:07,492
Dhanu, Deputy CM and
my brother-in-law are grouping..

312
00:21:07,595 --> 00:21:10,291
Dhanu at the age of 30 aspires
to be the next CM..

313
00:21:10,398 --> 00:21:11,888
And Peddaina is okay with it..

314
00:21:12,133 --> 00:21:13,498
How can Dhanu be a CM?

315
00:21:13,735 --> 00:21:16,226
He's 30, with 3 rape cases..

316
00:21:16,538 --> 00:21:18,563
No qualification..
Alcohol and drug abuse..

317
00:21:20,141 --> 00:21:23,110
Doesn't know the meaning of democracy..

318
00:21:23,211 --> 00:21:24,371
How can he be a CM?

319
00:21:24,479 --> 00:21:25,969
My son Arjun would be a better choice..

320
00:21:50,004 --> 00:21:52,871
None has played a game like this

321
00:21:52,974 --> 00:21:55,738
Life is like a chess play

322
00:21:55,977 --> 00:21:58,878
These flames can't be extinguished

323
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,949
The Ceremony ends in this fire

324
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:07,989
A betrayal of the good in the war

325
00:22:08,089 --> 00:22:10,853
This crime won't continue

326
00:22:11,025 --> 00:22:12,788
This is our generation..

327
00:22:12,894 --> 00:22:24,499
Salutations to Mother lndia!

328
00:23:37,579 --> 00:23:48,456
To my nation which
remains alone..

329
00:23:49,557 --> 00:24:00,456
Let it be as a Dhuruva star
in the broken sky..

330
00:24:01,469 --> 00:24:07,499
Money rules the
power and pride..

331
00:24:07,609 --> 00:24:13,172
..Would change it for the good

332
00:24:13,548 --> 00:24:18,281
And troubles into a bed of roses

333
00:24:18,386 --> 00:24:24,416
He promised to pay for this bread..
Salutations to Mother lndia!

334
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:33,596
Come, let us destroy the corruption
Your kind person CM Mr.Sanjeevaiah

335
00:24:43,244 --> 00:24:44,142
What is it Rajanna?

336
00:24:44,913 --> 00:24:47,609
Dad gave a black bag to me..

337
00:24:48,383 --> 00:24:50,544
-When was this?
-Three days ago..

338
00:24:51,052 --> 00:24:52,280
Three days ago?

339
00:24:53,187 --> 00:24:55,553
-Let's go home fast.. urgent..
-Okay sir..

340
00:24:58,793 --> 00:24:59,623
Arjun Sir..

341
00:25:01,663 --> 00:25:05,759
-Yes Rajanna? -For my daughter's
medical college admission..

342
00:25:08,303 --> 00:25:10,134
l took 20 lakhs from the bag..

343
00:25:11,639 --> 00:25:12,731
Sorry sir..

344
00:25:13,174 --> 00:25:14,801
l will slowly return the money..

345
00:25:14,909 --> 00:25:16,274
Don't be sorry Rajanna..

346
00:25:17,645 --> 00:25:20,079
You've proved that,
honesty is still left in a few people..

347
00:25:20,248 --> 00:25:21,408
lt's okay..
Take good care of her education..

348
00:25:21,516 --> 00:25:23,484
-Thank you sir..
-Now let's go fast

349
00:25:51,312 --> 00:25:52,870
Dear.. phone..

350
00:26:01,889 --> 00:26:03,652
Ali..
lt's me Arjun, CM'S son..

351
00:26:06,027 --> 00:26:07,051
l found your money..

352
00:26:08,429 --> 00:26:09,726
All your problems are solved..

353
00:26:09,831 --> 00:26:10,729
Sir.. is that true?

354
00:26:11,766 --> 00:26:13,131
Come and meet me in the morning.. okay..

355
00:26:13,901 --> 00:26:15,266
Yes sir..
l'll be there..

356
00:26:30,351 --> 00:26:31,249
Mr. Mahadevayya..

357
00:26:31,352 --> 00:26:34,583
ln this state..
Right from a peon's post, to a CM's post..

358
00:26:34,689 --> 00:26:35,986
All the appointments happen
with your approval..

359
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:38,058
But, you don't allow anybody
else to be in power..

360
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,252
Except your family members..

361
00:26:40,361 --> 00:26:43,194
lf that's the situation.. When will the
weaker sections of the society prosper..

362
00:26:43,297 --> 00:26:44,924
Why are you being so casteist?

363
00:26:45,033 --> 00:26:46,091
Look Raniamma..

364
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,169
Based on their occupations..

365
00:26:49,337 --> 00:26:51,897
People were divided into
different castes centuries ago..

366
00:26:52,006 --> 00:26:54,975
This is not something,
that we've created now..

367
00:26:55,076 --> 00:27:00,104
Therefore a ruler should always rule
and a cleaner should always clean..

368
00:27:00,214 --> 00:27:03,843
Only then, we'll have some discipline
in our growth as humans..

369
00:27:03,951 --> 00:27:04,781
and that's my belief

370
00:27:04,886 --> 00:27:07,582
Do you mean to say that..
Other than Dhanunjay..

371
00:27:07,689 --> 00:27:10,157
Nobody else will get a chance to be a CM..

372
00:27:10,258 --> 00:27:11,225
Yes..

373
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,687
lt's birthright of my family..

374
00:27:19,067 --> 00:27:20,625
l am of the same opinion..

375
00:27:20,802 --> 00:27:22,770
Apart from news,
we also have opinions..

376
00:27:23,738 --> 00:27:25,035
Find where is Munuswamy?

377
00:27:26,541 --> 00:27:27,838
-What?
-Nothing uncle.

378
00:27:27,942 --> 00:27:30,911
l'm leaving to S.S in 10 days..
l'll need cash..

379
00:27:31,012 --> 00:27:32,172
Sell all the properties..

380
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,407
Any business plans?

381
00:27:34,515 --> 00:27:36,346
Yes, planning..
l need cash urgently..

382
00:27:36,451 --> 00:27:39,079
-l'll arrange for it in 2 or 3 days..
-Give the phone here..

383
00:27:40,588 --> 00:27:42,283
Arjun, Dhanu here..

384
00:27:43,124 --> 00:27:44,091
Why are you in such a hurry?

385
00:27:44,192 --> 00:27:45,352
Stay back till l become a CM..

386
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,485
No Dhanu..
Once the business is set there..

387
00:27:47,595 --> 00:27:48,493
l can relax..

388
00:27:49,731 --> 00:27:50,698
When is your election?

389
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:53,562
l don't need the election..
lt's a mere formality..

390
00:27:53,668 --> 00:27:54,498
lt'll happen in the next two weeks..

391
00:27:59,040 --> 00:27:59,938
Hello is it Mr. Srikanth?

392
00:28:00,041 --> 00:28:01,065
Mr. Arjun Prasad..

393
00:28:01,242 --> 00:28:03,073
Sir, transfer the amount,
we've spoken about..

394
00:28:03,177 --> 00:28:04,337
-lt's urgently..
-You want only cash sir?

395
00:28:04,445 --> 00:28:06,003
-Yes..
-What is it Arjun?

396
00:28:06,714 --> 00:28:08,272
lnstead of property..l'll take cash..

397
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:10,280
Okay Sir..

398
00:28:11,252 --> 00:28:12,150
lt's urgent..

399
00:28:14,789 --> 00:28:16,086
Hello is it Mr. Penchallayya?

400
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:18,215
Everything in Cash..

401
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:22,229
Mom.. l am not going to S.S

402
00:28:24,699 --> 00:28:26,189
-Sure?
-l'm sure..

403
00:28:26,367 --> 00:28:28,267
Any grudge against anybody?

404
00:28:28,903 --> 00:28:30,268
Mom! Nothing like that..

405
00:28:30,905 --> 00:28:33,135
l just want to do what dad couldn't do..

406
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:38,210
At least then, will the
people forgive him?

407
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:39,804
They'll forgive him..

408
00:28:39,914 --> 00:28:41,814
They'll definitely forgive him
for being your father..

409
00:28:52,827 --> 00:28:53,919
Thank you Sir..
you saved my life.. thank you sir

410
00:28:54,028 --> 00:28:55,859
lt's okay..
lt's your money right?

411
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:58,858
People are killing each other
for petty amounts..

412
00:28:59,033 --> 00:29:00,796
just because l asked you..

413
00:29:00,968 --> 00:29:03,163
You've trusted me and got my money back..

414
00:29:03,337 --> 00:29:05,134
Sir, l owe you my life..

415
00:29:05,306 --> 00:29:11,472
You've given me a new life
To save my own property..

416
00:29:11,646 --> 00:29:14,080
l bribed every crook in the government..

417
00:29:14,682 --> 00:29:15,979
lncluding your dad..

418
00:29:19,287 --> 00:29:21,517
There is no humanity
left in our society sir..

419
00:29:21,622 --> 00:29:25,251
lt's filled with parasites
The whole system is corrupt sir..

420
00:29:25,493 --> 00:29:26,517
Shall we change it?

421
00:29:28,296 --> 00:29:29,456
Or at least shall we try to change it?

422
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:33,133
You must be knowing
everyone in our government?

423
00:29:33,234 --> 00:29:35,725
You must be knowing
how much to pay? Who to pay?

424
00:29:38,005 --> 00:29:39,973
To get your work done
with the government..

425
00:29:40,074 --> 00:29:41,837
You need to bribe them
Even a kid knows this..

426
00:29:42,143 --> 00:29:45,044
l certainly know the price
of everyone in the system..

427
00:29:48,216 --> 00:29:49,376
Will you work for me?

428
00:29:51,352 --> 00:29:53,320

00:29:53,554 --> 00:29:54,714
Sir.. l owe you my life..

430
00:29:54,956 --> 00:29:55,786
What's my job sir?

431
00:29:57,959 --> 00:29:59,449
Ali, l am going to be the next CM..

432
00:30:00,428 --> 00:30:01,622
You are my first employee..

433
00:30:02,396 --> 00:30:03,294
You are my secretary..

434
00:30:07,268 --> 00:30:08,360
Nobody should know this

435
00:30:26,687 --> 00:30:29,087

Look Ratna..

442
00:30:46,707 --> 00:30:48,197
This news is not for people..

443
00:30:48,442 --> 00:30:51,240
Nobody should know this..

444
00:30:51,345 --> 00:30:52,778
You need to be silent about this..

445
00:30:53,147 --> 00:30:54,375
You want me to remain silent?

446
00:30:55,483 --> 00:30:56,381
lt's impossible..

447
00:30:57,952 --> 00:31:00,648
lt's so unlike me..

448
00:31:03,157 --> 00:31:04,181
Look Ratna..

449
00:31:04,358 --> 00:31:05,848

450
00:31:06,827 --> 00:31:08,522
You want to bribe Ratna?

451
00:31:09,196 --> 00:31:11,460
l am a media person not a politician..

452
00:31:11,632 --> 00:31:12,929
Okay okay.. take it as a gift

453
00:31:14,168 --> 00:31:18,195
Look!

..to remain silent about this whole thing

455
00:31:24,378 --> 00:31:28,280
He will come as a
prince in fiction story

456
00:31:28,382 --> 00:31:30,942
And will take you in flying horse..

457
00:31:31,218 --> 00:31:32,310
Tell me what you want?

458
00:31:33,654 --> 00:31:39,183

459
00:31:45,967 --> 00:31:46,865

00:31:47,702 --> 00:31:48,600
Look Ratna..

461
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:52,269
The country is in grave danger..
There's no awakening in the society..

462
00:31:53,441 --> 00:31:55,272
lt's mass hysteria all around

463
00:31:55,643 --> 00:31:58,203
Youngsters are sleeping
Politicians are looting..

464
00:31:58,379 --> 00:32:00,279
There is no safety,
Especially for girls like you..

465
00:32:01,749 --> 00:32:02,579
So what?

466
00:32:04,952 --> 00:32:06,510
What do you mean? So what?

467
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,713
As a responsible citien is it not
your responsibility to help me?

468
00:32:08,823 --> 00:32:11,223
What is in it for me?
What is in it for me Arjun?

469
00:32:11,425 --> 00:32:12,687
What has this country given me?

470
00:32:12,927 --> 00:32:15,555
lf l die today,
l won't even get a PF..

471
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:19,297
Why should l sacrifice myself
for a country like this..

472
00:32:23,004 --> 00:32:24,835
l'm capable of giving
a good speech as well.. okay..

473
00:32:26,507 --> 00:32:27,599
Okay..

474
00:32:27,808 --> 00:32:28,934
What do you know about me?

475
00:32:29,043 --> 00:32:31,341
l might be a drunkard,
l might be a womaniser..

476
00:32:32,847 --> 00:32:35,372
Even if the CM's son was a pig,
l wouldn't mind it..

477
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:40,416
None of the girls in the
country would mind it..

478
00:32:40,855 --> 00:32:41,822
But, l am not okay with it

479
00:32:41,922 --> 00:32:44,254
But Arjun. You don't have a choice
and that's the reason..

We'll have an understanding okay..

484
00:32:52,967 --> 00:32:55,367
we'll get married once you become a CM..

485
00:32:55,436 --> 00:32:56,994
Provided both of us are okay with it..

486
00:32:57,338 --> 00:33:00,398
l mean l'll be wooing the CM and..

487
00:33:00,775 --> 00:33:02,037

-Otherwise..
-Otherwise?

00:33:18,959 --> 00:33:19,755
Not with you..

494
00:33:20,428 --> 00:33:21,326
Tell me Arjun..

495
00:33:22,863 --> 00:33:24,353
Hey don't be so worried..

496
00:33:24,732 --> 00:33:27,963
All the guys, who l have wooed till now..
Have fallen for me..

497
00:33:28,069 --> 00:33:31,835
Your 50 crores are safe..

00:33:36,877 --> 00:33:38,367
l want three portfolios..

499
00:33:39,313 --> 00:33:41,406
-But the deal was only one..
-Look Dhanujay..

500
00:33:41,582 --> 00:33:42,879
You are going to be a CM..

501
00:33:42,983 --> 00:33:45,076
Am l questioning your
credibility for the post..

502
00:33:45,352 --> 00:33:47,411
Am l making an issue out of it.. no right?

503

l am telling what l need
lt's for you to think and decide..

504
00:33:48,989 --> 00:33:51,014
Still l am 16 years old..

505
00:33:51,358 --> 00:33:52,791
You seem to be well dressed..

506
00:33:53,627 --> 00:33:56,460
Been to temple..

Near Hanuman Temple..

Got pooja done on your name..
Didn't know your sun sign..

Your feet look soo smooth

My legs too look good..

Of course you can't see them now..

All these things are
understood Munuswamy..

You don't have to ask for them..

526

Your boss is insulting me a lot..

Ask him to be careful with me..

533
00:35:39,633 --> 00:35:40,895
Okay Madam.. Okay..

579
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:12,551

And Dhanu will call you..

598
00:38:57,698 --> 00:38:59,131

Nation or beauty, it is yours

633
00:40:45,939 --> 00:40:46,963
What was he saying about me?

634
00:40:47,241 --> 00:40:47,900

Enough of what you get

670
00:44:14,347 --> 00:44:16,281
lf you say a word..

671
00:44:18,518 --> 00:44:20,452

00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:11,698
ln the party..

678
00:45:11,805 --> 00:45:13,238
She whispered something in your ear right?

679
00:45:17,677 --> 00:45:19,235
She said she'll give me
company in her room..

680
00:45:20,046 --> 00:45:21,775
Why didn't you scold her?

681
00:45:22,115 --> 00:45:24,174
lf anyone said that to me..
l would've slapped..

682
00:45:26,219 --> 00:45:27,117

684
00:45:29,089 --> 00:45:30,113
What's your problem?

685
00:45:31,291 --> 00:45:33,054
Everything seems
to be a joke to you?

686
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:35,455
lf they get to know that
Ali was taking details..

687
00:45:35,562 --> 00:45:36,790
Do you know what'll happen?
They'll kill us..

688
00:45:37,564 --> 00:45:42,194
One small mistake and we'll be
slaughtered, they're criminals..

689
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:47,101
l just have 10 days..

690
00:45:47,174 --> 00:45:49,074
And you want to tag along
with me everywhere..

691
00:45:50,343 --> 00:45:51,571
Moreover, you don't even help me

692
00:45:51,678 --> 00:45:53,509
Why should l help you?

693
00:45:53,613 --> 00:45:55,012
Are you a saint?

694
00:45:55,615 --> 00:45:57,242
What is so great about what you doing?

695
00:45:57,350 --> 00:45:59,113
You are conspiring to become a CM..

696
00:45:59,686 --> 00:46:01,517
You're not satisfied with
what your dad looted..

697
00:46:01,621 --> 00:46:02,645
you want power..

698
00:46:02,756 --> 00:46:03,814
So that you can loot more..

699
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:05,057
That's it right?

700
00:46:11,231 --> 00:46:13,461
You'll only remember that he was corrupt..

701
00:46:13,633 --> 00:46:16,397
But, you don't remember that
he's dead and was murdered..

702
00:46:16,503 --> 00:46:20,132
History will never forgive him..
People will also never forgive him..

703
00:46:21,074 --> 00:46:23,838
l am just trying to change that.
Not to loot more money..

704
00:46:24,244 --> 00:46:25,677
l am not such a crook..

705
00:46:25,846 --> 00:46:26,744
Get in..

706
00:46:29,883 --> 00:46:31,748
Ali, of all the people
who came to party..

707
00:46:31,852 --> 00:46:33,149
42 MLAs belong
to Peddaina's group..

708
00:46:33,553 --> 00:46:36,317
Apart from them 30 MLAs
belong to dhanu's group..

709
00:46:36,489 --> 00:46:37,649
We can't do anything about them..

710
00:46:37,824 --> 00:46:39,724
This is the list of remaining 53 MLAs..

711
00:46:39,826 --> 00:46:43,057
Of this 14 MLAs belong to
Deputy CM and Home Ministers group..

712
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:46,394
Now our job is to get
these 53 into our group..

713
00:46:46,566 --> 00:46:49,330
l know everybody's character..
Everyone can be bought Leave it me..

714
00:46:49,436 --> 00:46:49,868
l'll manage them..

715
00:46:50,136 --> 00:46:51,103
But, there is a problem Ali..

716
00:46:51,705 --> 00:46:55,539
lf Dhanu get's to know this..
lt'll be a big mess..

717
00:46:55,709 --> 00:46:58,269
We'll not involve you..
lnstead, l'll give the money..

718
00:46:58,378 --> 00:46:59,538
How'll you manage
without me being involved?

719
00:46:59,779 --> 00:47:03,340
Sir..They are politicians..
They'll just take the money..

720
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:04,678
They'll not be bothered to know..
who's paying them..

721
00:47:04,784 --> 00:47:06,411
They'll not ask who's paying
but, they'll definitely ask why?

722
00:47:08,188 --> 00:47:08,882
Correct..

723
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:11,487
lf they get to know that it's for their vote..

724
00:47:11,591 --> 00:47:13,491
All of them will discuss..
Then, everybody will get to know..

725
00:47:13,793 --> 00:47:14,555
You do one thing..

726
00:47:15,128 --> 00:47:17,221
Get me all the information about
these 53 MLAs.. By evening..

727
00:47:19,232 --> 00:47:22,099
l have lot of contacts in media..

728
00:47:22,836 --> 00:47:24,201
Ali.. next
Tell me sir..

729
00:47:24,304 --> 00:47:26,738
l want an 8/4 photo of Dad
in this hall..okay

730
00:47:32,379 --> 00:47:33,539
You don't be angry with me..

731
00:47:33,713 --> 00:47:35,340
l have lot of contacts in media..

732
00:47:35,448 --> 00:47:37,109
l'll get their information

733
00:47:37,183 --> 00:47:37,808
Okay.. see to it..

734
00:47:38,652 --> 00:47:42,110
Okay.. then smile.. Smile..

735
00:47:42,956 --> 00:47:44,821
-Did he smile?
-Yes..

736
00:47:45,258 --> 00:47:45,849
Are you sure?

737
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:48,487
-Let's go..
-Did you see?

738
00:47:53,466 --> 00:47:54,694
Sorry for calling you urgently..

739
00:47:55,535 --> 00:47:56,365
Nothing much sir..

740
00:47:56,536 --> 00:47:58,163
Before dad's 11th day ceremony..

741
00:47:58,405 --> 00:48:00,373
l wanted to do a few things
that dad wanted to do..

742
00:48:01,474 --> 00:48:02,907
Sir dad had written about
you in his personal diary..

743
00:48:04,311 --> 00:48:08,611
lt seems, you've always stood by him,
without expecting anything in return..

744
00:48:08,949 --> 00:48:11,611
lt seems he always felt bad
that he couldn't do anything for you..

745
00:48:11,851 --> 00:48:12,909
..Mom told the same..

746
00:48:22,996 --> 00:48:25,487
-Sir, take this
-What's this?

747
00:48:25,598 --> 00:48:27,429
Money.. it's 2 crores..

748
00:48:31,271 --> 00:48:32,704
-For who?
-lt's for you

749
00:48:36,409 --> 00:48:37,899
-Why?
-Take it for dad..

750
00:48:42,615 --> 00:48:47,746
This is the burial ground..

751
00:48:47,988 --> 00:48:49,580
May Sanjeevaiah rest in peace..

752
00:48:49,689 --> 00:48:51,247
..filled with selfishness

753
00:48:52,359 --> 00:48:56,352
This is our nation

754
00:48:56,596 --> 00:48:57,927
Sanjeevaiah rest in peace..

755
00:48:58,264 --> 00:48:59,993
Sir, actually dad wanted
to give you 4 crores..

756
00:49:02,268 --> 00:49:05,897
But, l couldn't manage the rest..
ln another 10 days, l'll send the rest..

757
00:49:06,006 --> 00:49:06,700
You be happy..

758
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,134
This is our nation

759
00:49:12,812 --> 00:49:15,645
Sanjeevaiah rest in peace..
Sanjeevaiah rest in peace..

760
00:49:15,749 --> 00:49:16,306
Sir.. just a sec..

761
00:49:16,983 --> 00:49:18,814
Don't let anyone know
that l gave you money..

762
00:49:18,918 --> 00:49:19,907
Not even to your family members..

763
00:49:20,053 --> 00:49:22,021
We'll have tax problems..

764
00:49:22,355 --> 00:49:23,879
No.. nobody will know it..

765
00:49:25,492 --> 00:49:28,017
God bless you son..
God bless you..

766
00:49:29,295 --> 00:49:32,423
Yes.. You are so different
from Dhanunjay..

767
00:49:33,333 --> 00:49:35,426
He's born to a great man..

768
00:49:35,735 --> 00:49:38,863
Sanjeevaiah rest in peace..
Sanjeevaiah rest in peace..

769
00:49:40,473 --> 00:49:41,701
lf we ask.. will he vote for us?

770
00:49:42,409 --> 00:49:43,637
He'll die for you..

771
00:49:44,044 --> 00:49:45,011
Will he tell anyone?

772
00:49:45,612 --> 00:49:46,874
He'll die.. but, he'll not tell

773
00:49:47,614 --> 00:49:48,444
Will the plan work?

774
00:49:48,915 --> 00:49:50,576
100% Mr.CM

775
00:49:51,351 --> 00:49:52,249
Should l get another MLA?

776
00:49:52,352 --> 00:49:54,843
l am hungry..
First we'll have something.. Rajanna..

777
00:49:57,023 --> 00:49:58,320
Let's go..

778
00:50:03,997 --> 00:50:12,905
This is the cemetery of selfishness..

779
00:50:14,507 --> 00:50:23,848
lt runs as a chariot in the world

780
00:50:29,756 --> 00:50:31,849
This is our nation

781
00:50:46,806 --> 00:50:49,434
No one has played a game like this

782
00:50:49,542 --> 00:50:51,942
Life is like a chess play

783
00:50:52,078 --> 00:50:54,478
These flames can't be extinguished

784
00:50:54,714 --> 00:50:56,978
The Ceremony ends in this fire

785
00:50:57,383 --> 00:51:02,650
This is betrayal of the good in the war

786
00:51:02,755 --> 00:51:05,087
This crime won't continue

787
00:51:05,358 --> 00:51:06,882
This is our generation..

788
00:51:06,993 --> 00:51:09,655
This is our nation

789
00:51:41,928 --> 00:51:43,759
Deputy CM and Home Minister..

790
00:51:44,998 --> 00:51:46,090
My dad gave you those portfolios..

791
00:51:46,199 --> 00:51:47,166
That's why, l called you like that..

792
00:51:49,202 --> 00:51:50,897
lf you want.. l can repeat few more times..

793
00:51:51,905 --> 00:51:54,396
Because, if Dhanu becomes a CM..
you'll lose those portfolios..

794
00:51:55,975 --> 00:51:57,533
They look at each other..
Forget about portfolios..

795
00:51:58,211 --> 00:52:00,475
Dhanu doesn't spare anyone
who come in his way..

796
00:52:01,214 --> 00:52:03,944
You guys may end up in jail..

797
00:52:04,517 --> 00:52:05,108
And lt's a fact..

798
00:52:06,085 --> 00:52:07,746
l respect you a lot..

799
00:52:08,655 --> 00:52:10,555
More than that, l love my dad..

800
00:52:11,457 --> 00:52:15,621
You'll have to do me a favour
along with your 14 MLAs

801
00:52:19,933 --> 00:52:23,835
Take it.. lt's okay.. Take it..

802
00:52:25,805 --> 00:52:27,033
Go in and check the flat..

803
00:52:32,979 --> 00:52:42,411
This world bestows to money

804
00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:48,489
Let the fate good or bad,
don't give up

805
00:52:48,962 --> 00:52:53,831
Let the fate good or bad,
don't give up

806
00:52:57,470 --> 00:52:58,494
Sit down sir..

807
00:53:04,744 --> 00:53:09,010
Your portfolios and this flat all yours..
Tell me..

808
00:53:09,949 --> 00:53:12,440
This is our nation

809
00:53:15,154 --> 00:53:17,622
This is our nation

810
00:53:42,548 --> 00:53:43,276
What is it?

811
00:53:43,683 --> 00:53:45,082
At this hour of the day..

812
00:53:45,184 --> 00:53:46,845
ln this rain.. you are here

813
00:53:46,953 --> 00:53:49,080
-Come in.. come in..
-Sit down..

814
00:53:52,258 --> 00:53:56,957
-ls Arjun seeing any white girl?
-No

815
00:53:58,031 --> 00:53:59,999
Then, what's the problem?

816
00:54:05,071 --> 00:54:07,972
Peddaina.. you'll have to give me your word..

817
00:54:10,176 --> 00:54:12,269
Definitely.. Ask me

818
00:54:13,012 --> 00:54:14,001
You shouldn't go back on your word..

819
00:54:16,115 --> 00:54:18,640
You are wife of my brother
who was like my son to me..

820
00:54:19,552 --> 00:54:21,713
lt's not even 10 days since his death..

821
00:54:22,088 --> 00:54:25,148
You're here with your son,

822
00:54:25,692 --> 00:54:27,091
At this hour of the day
asking me for a promise..

823
00:54:28,094 --> 00:54:29,721
How can l not give it?

824
00:54:29,996 --> 00:54:31,987
l'll definitely stand by it..

825
00:54:32,131 --> 00:54:33,530
What is it?
Ask me

826
00:54:36,102 --> 00:54:37,797
My husband's last wish..

827
00:54:40,073 --> 00:54:41,938
My son Arjun should be the CM..

828
00:54:43,142 --> 00:54:46,634
with your support..
You've promised..

829
00:55:06,632 --> 00:55:07,792
What's with you?

830
00:55:08,401 --> 00:55:12,030
You said you are leaving to S.S
and settle in your business..

831
00:55:12,138 --> 00:55:13,162
What's this suddenly?

832
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:15,807
Don't be a fool..

833
00:55:15,975 --> 00:55:18,034
What do know about politics?

834
00:55:18,211 --> 00:55:21,977
Dhanu is cray..
He might even kill you..

835
00:55:22,081 --> 00:55:23,605
What should l tell him now?

836
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:25,818
Tell me

837
00:55:26,119 --> 00:55:29,816
Everyone seems to be taking
their own decisions..

838
00:55:36,028 --> 00:55:37,791
it's party meeting in the morning..

839
00:55:38,698 --> 00:55:42,361
Dhanu will be unanimously
declared as the next CM..

840
00:55:42,902 --> 00:55:44,164
Everything is planned that way..

841
00:55:44,404 --> 00:55:46,736
After making him a CM
l've decided to head back home

842
00:55:47,407 --> 00:55:50,968
Listen.. in this situation..
it's really tough..

843
00:55:51,277 --> 00:55:52,244
it's out of my hand..

844
00:55:52,345 --> 00:55:54,108
lf it was possible,
would you have done it?

845
00:55:54,213 --> 00:55:55,976
lf it was possible..
why would l not do it?

846
00:55:56,082 --> 00:55:57,276
Moreover, l promised you..

847
00:55:58,050 --> 00:55:59,017
Listen to me..

848
00:56:00,219 --> 00:56:02,687
lt's very difficult..
it's out of my control..

849
00:56:02,789 --> 00:56:06,247
Ask your group of MLAs not to vote..
and you stay neutral..

850
00:56:06,359 --> 00:56:11,058
lt'll be a unanimous decision..
The question of voting doesn't arise..

851
00:56:11,164 --> 00:56:13,064
-What if it's raised?
-So what?

852
00:56:18,771 --> 00:56:19,931
What did you do?

853
00:56:23,009 --> 00:56:25,375
l got it.. got it

854
00:56:27,213 --> 00:56:28,180
Why did you do it?

855
00:56:29,282 --> 00:56:30,044
Why did you do it?

856
00:56:30,149 --> 00:56:33,880
Peddaina the people of this state
deserve a better CM than Dhanu..

857
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:36,887
-So.. is this the way to do it?
-This is the only way to do it..

858
00:56:36,989 --> 00:56:38,013
And it should happen now..

859
00:56:38,858 --> 00:56:40,120
This is my only chance..

860
00:56:40,226 --> 00:56:41,989
You've given your word so stand by it..

861
00:56:42,228 --> 00:56:46,096
With Dhanunjay almost certain
to takeover as the next CM..

862
00:56:46,299 --> 00:56:51,202
His supporters've gathered at the party office,
shouting slogans in his support..

863
00:56:51,370 --> 00:56:54,032
Party president Mahadevayya,
will officially declare.

864
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:56,973
Dhanunjay as the next CM
in a few minutes from now..

865
00:56:57,844 --> 00:57:02,747
The next thing on our agenda is..
Electing the new leader of our party..

866
00:57:02,849 --> 00:57:05,010
l mean the next CM..

867
00:57:07,286 --> 00:57:09,311
lt's a unanimous decision..

868
00:57:10,423 --> 00:57:13,824
Dhanunjay is our party candidate..

869
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:20,091
How can you elect unanimously sir?

870
00:57:23,069 --> 00:57:24,001
Are you drunk?

871
00:57:24,303 --> 00:57:27,272
We're not so cultured to get drunk and
come to a meeting Mr.Dhanunjay..

872
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,340
Watch what you are saying Mr.Dhanunjay?

873
00:57:29,442 --> 00:57:30,841
What the hell are you guys talking?

874
00:57:30,943 --> 00:57:33,935
-There is no other candidate..
-Are we so thick skinned?

875
00:57:34,046 --> 00:57:37,106
-ls this the way to pay respect
to our beloved leader.. -No sir..

876
00:57:37,183 --> 00:57:39,413
Till now Sanjeevaiah is our CM..

877
00:57:39,752 --> 00:57:42,448
..and after his death,
his son Arjun Prasad is our CM..

878
00:57:42,555 --> 00:57:44,250
Long live CM Arjun Prasad..

879
00:57:44,357 --> 00:57:48,191
Long live CM Arjun Prasad..

880
00:57:48,294 --> 00:57:52,754
Long live CM Arjun Prasad..

881
00:57:53,165 --> 00:57:59,331
Long live CM Arjun Prasad..

882
00:57:59,438 --> 00:58:05,274
Long live CM Arjun Prasad..

883
00:58:05,444 --> 00:58:10,040
Long live CM Arjun Prasad..

884
00:58:10,116 --> 00:58:11,344
Make a note
of everyone whose shouting..

885
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:12,781
Everybody stop it..

886
00:58:13,185 --> 00:58:14,015
Everybody be seated..

887
00:58:14,887 --> 00:58:17,549
Everybody be seated..be seated..

888
00:58:18,324 --> 00:58:21,487
-Stop it
-Sit down..

889
00:58:22,828 --> 00:58:25,092
You're in a meeting..
Not in a fish market..

890
00:58:25,197 --> 00:58:27,825
We don't want a fight..
We want an election..

891
00:58:27,934 --> 00:58:29,959
Arjun Prasad should be the next CM..

892
00:58:30,069 --> 00:58:32,037
Long live CM Arjun Prasad

893
00:58:32,805 --> 00:58:34,329
Yes, we want an election..

894
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:35,532
Arjun sir should contest..

895
00:58:35,808 --> 00:58:37,207
Sanjeevaiah is like God to us..

896
00:58:37,310 --> 00:58:40,143
He's your brother..
and Dhanunjay is his nephew..

897
00:58:40,446 --> 00:58:43,142
At the age of 18,
when Dhanu was convicted in a murder..

898
00:58:43,316 --> 00:58:44,943
He got him out
and made him a minister..

899
00:58:45,051 --> 00:58:46,040
Don't you remember that?

900
00:58:46,118 --> 00:58:47,210
He's a God to us, sir..

901
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:49,151
we won't allow this to happen..

902
00:58:49,322 --> 00:58:52,155
lf an election doesn't happen..
All of us will resign..

903
00:58:52,258 --> 00:58:54,488
Then, our rival Munuswamy
will become the CM..

904
00:58:55,094 --> 00:58:55,958
Don't beat around the bush..

905
00:58:56,062 --> 00:58:57,290
Tell me how much you want and take it?

906
00:58:57,396 --> 00:58:59,159
Don't talk about money..

907
00:58:59,332 --> 00:59:01,493
-lt sounds like a joke..
-Shut up..

908
00:59:02,168 --> 00:59:03,066
What the hell are you talking?

909
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:08,302
Sit down..

910
00:59:08,474 --> 00:59:10,032
Our portfolios are safe..

911
00:59:11,877 --> 00:59:13,208
Why are you creating this chaos?

912
00:59:13,512 --> 00:59:16,003
Why are you shouting?

913
00:59:16,182 --> 00:59:17,012
Have you gone mad?

914
00:59:17,116 --> 00:59:19,050
Arjun Prasad should be the CM..

915
00:59:19,151 --> 00:59:20,482
How can he be a CM.. He's a kid

916
00:59:20,586 --> 00:59:21,416
Call him here..

917
00:59:21,587 --> 00:59:23,418
lf you want..
l'll call him here.. talk to him

918
00:59:23,522 --> 00:59:24,284
Call him here..

919
00:59:24,457 --> 00:59:26,357
We're calling him wait..
We're calling him..

920
00:59:26,459 --> 00:59:27,619
ln a few days, he's leaving to S.S..

921
00:59:27,893 --> 00:59:29,155
He's not interested in politics..

922
00:59:30,029 --> 00:59:31,053
Moreover we are together..

923
00:59:31,197 --> 00:59:32,425
This is our family matter..

924
00:59:32,531 --> 00:59:33,998
Why are you bringing politics into it..

925
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:34,930
Call him once..

926
00:59:35,067 --> 00:59:36,227
Call him uncle..

927
00:59:37,069 --> 00:59:39,037
He'll only answer them..

928
00:59:40,072 --> 00:59:43,371
l am the next CM
and he'll repeat the same thing..

929
00:59:47,179 --> 00:59:48,305
l've 3000..

930
00:59:50,349 --> 00:59:52,180
-Hello..
-What?

931
00:59:53,219 --> 00:59:54,584
What's happening inside?

932
00:59:55,054 --> 00:59:56,544
Keep my name out of this..

933
00:59:56,656 --> 00:59:57,623
lt's okay.. tell

934
00:59:58,090 --> 00:59:59,853
No consensus..

935
01:00:02,094 --> 01:00:03,994
Flash news.. focus on
Arjun Prasad's background..

936
01:00:04,897 --> 01:00:09,095
lt was widely believed by the people,
media, and political analysts..

937
01:00:09,201 --> 01:00:11,499
..that Dhanunjay will
take over the political..

938
01:00:11,604 --> 01:00:14,164
..legacy of late Mr.Sanjeevaiah and
become the next CM..

939
01:00:14,306 --> 01:00:16,103
But, as the events unfolded
in the party meeting..

940
01:00:16,208 --> 01:00:18,506
To everybody's surprise,
A new name emerged..

941
01:00:18,611 --> 01:00:22,240
it is neither the Deputy CM
nor the Home minister..

942
01:00:22,348 --> 01:00:24,976
But, it's Late Sanjeevaiah's
son Arjun Prasad..

943
01:00:25,084 --> 01:00:26,915
who doesn't have
any political experience..

944
01:00:27,019 --> 01:00:32,355
Long live..Arjun Prasad

945
01:00:32,491 --> 01:00:38,054
Long live..Arjun Prasad

946
01:00:55,114 --> 01:00:55,944
My brother..

947

You asked for him..

948
01:00:57,750 --> 01:00:58,614
Arjun tell them..

949
01:00:59,085 --> 01:01:03,021
Tell them that it's me
who's going to be the next CM..

950
01:01:03,389 --> 01:01:04,219
Go

951
01:01:06,058 --> 01:01:11,257
Long live.. Arjun Prasad

952
01:01:11,464 --> 01:01:16,731
Dhanunjay Down with

More than me, my mom and my Family..

lt was always party that came first
to my dad, he loved his party..

955
01:01:26,512 --> 01:01:27,501
He's carried it through
many turbulent times and..

956
01:01:27,613 --> 01:01:29,342
..delivered victories
in the last 13 years..

957
01:01:29,448 --> 01:01:31,382
He's supported everyone of you over here..

958
01:01:31,584 --> 01:01:36,453
He's literally built
your political careers..

959
01:01:37,056 --> 01:01:39,354
ls this the way you
show your respect to him?

960
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:42,026
lt's not even 10 days since his death..

961
01:01:42,194 --> 01:01:44,094
and you've started
fighting for positions..

962
01:01:44,463 --> 01:01:46,454
ls this the way to show
your gratitude towards him?

963
01:01:47,566 --> 01:01:50,467
ls it not your responsibility to fulfill
his dreams and carry his legacy forward?

964
01:01:50,569 --> 01:01:52,628
Yes.. yes.. yes..

965
01:02:05,117 --> 01:02:06,482
May Sanjeevaiah's soul rest in peace..

966
01:02:06,585 --> 01:02:09,782
Rest in peace

967
01:02:11,157 --> 01:02:14,149
The two people,
who l love the most in this world,

968
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:15,722
..are my Mom and my Dad..

969
01:02:17,196 --> 01:02:19,164
Both of them have only one wish..

970
01:02:19,632 --> 01:02:22,123
My mom's first wish, since my birth..

971
01:02:22,434 --> 01:02:24,368
My dad's last wish, before his death..

972
01:02:25,538 --> 01:02:26,800
That, l Should become a Chief minister..

973
01:02:31,677 --> 01:02:35,670
Long live.. CM Arjun Prasad

974
01:02:35,781 --> 01:02:40,275
Long live.. CM Arjun Prasad

975
01:02:51,197 --> 01:02:54,030
Mr.Sanjeevaiah sacrificed
his life for you people..

976
01:02:54,166 --> 01:02:56,293
He was your Leader and
he was brutally assassinated..

977
01:02:56,402 --> 01:02:58,700
You people decide, whether you are..

978
01:02:58,804 --> 01:03:00,704
..responsible to fulfill
his last wish or not..

979
01:03:01,106 --> 01:03:03,131
Since l'm responsible..
l'll fight the election..

980
01:03:03,242 --> 01:03:05,369
For my dad and for all you who love him..

01:03:05,477 --> 01:03:07,069
l'll join politics..

982
01:03:07,213 --> 01:03:09,681
whether people like it or not..

01:03:11,517 --> 01:03:13,815
Long live.. Our CM
Arjun Prasad Long live..

01:03:14,186 --> 01:03:19,488
Our CM Arjun Prasad Long live..
Our CM Arjun Prasad

985
01:03:20,125 --> 01:03:21,683
Arjun Prasad in the fray for CM's Post..

986
01:03:22,194 --> 01:03:25,823
Dhanunjay, who was believed to take over
as the next CM, in a state of shock..

987
01:03:26,131 --> 01:03:29,862
ln the last minute
Late Mr.Sanjeevaiah's son..

988
01:03:30,269 --> 01:03:33,238
Arjun Prasad.. Arjun Prasad..
Arjun Prasad..

989
01:03:33,372 --> 01:03:37,172
Till one hour ago no one knew this name..

990
01:03:37,309 --> 01:03:39,743
Now the whole state seems
to be reverberating with this name..

991
01:03:40,679 --> 01:03:44,308
We'll get you more details
from our reporter...

992
01:03:44,817 --> 01:03:48,514
Yes Raju.. in my opinion Arjun Prasad
is the right choice for the CM's post..

993
01:03:48,654 --> 01:03:49,814
What do you say Ram?

994
01:03:49,922 --> 01:03:52,083
How can you say that he's the
right choice for the CM's post?

995
01:03:52,291 --> 01:03:54,316
What more you need Ram?
28 years of age..

996
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:58,121
By the age of 25, he's completed
his Ph.D from Havard Sniversity..

997
01:03:58,197 --> 01:04:01,758
Right now, he's a C.E.O
to a fortune 500 company..

998
01:04:02,134 --> 01:04:04,159
Above all he's Sanjeevaiah sir's son..

999
01:04:04,403 --> 01:04:05,563
And that's the biggest quality..

1000
01:04:05,804 --> 01:04:07,499
Dhanu is a graduate from Niam College..

1001
01:04:07,907 --> 01:04:09,534
Of course he dropped out of it..

1002
01:04:09,875 --> 01:04:13,106
By 21 he was youth
wing president of Peoples' party..

1003
01:04:13,312 --> 01:04:16,839
And by 26 he was minister
of information and broadcasting..

1004
01:04:17,182 --> 01:04:18,877
Of course, by 18 he had various
criminal cases against him..

1005
01:04:19,151 --> 01:04:20,345
He was also involved
in lot of other scams..

1006
01:04:20,619 --> 01:04:24,214
Show me a politician
who is not involved in any crime.

1007
01:04:24,456 --> 01:04:25,889
Are you saying they're right?

1008
01:04:25,958 --> 01:04:27,391
lnstead of this mess..

1009
01:04:27,693 --> 01:04:29,923
lt's better we have Governor's rule..
That's my opinion..

1010
01:04:30,195 --> 01:04:31,787
lf Governor's rule is your opinion..

1011
01:04:31,931 --> 01:04:33,922
ln my opinion, Arjun Prasad
should be the CM..

1012
01:04:39,338 --> 01:04:42,671
PEOPLES' PARTY OFFlCE

1013
01:04:57,356 --> 01:04:59,950
Since our party's emergence 25 years ago..

1014
01:05:00,225 --> 01:05:01,783
For the first time today..

1015
01:05:02,494 --> 01:05:06,954
We have elected our leader,
through an election..

1016
01:05:08,233 --> 01:05:12,567
Our party's leader and
the new C.M of the state is..

1017
01:05:13,305 --> 01:05:14,772
Dr.Arjun Prasad

1018
01:05:14,907 --> 01:05:18,502
Long live.. CM Arjun Prasad

1019
01:05:18,610 --> 01:05:21,170
Long live.. CM Arjun Prasad

1020
01:05:26,785 --> 01:05:27,843
Arjun..

1021
01:05:29,989 --> 01:05:35,393
Why did you do this? Why?

1022
01:05:36,895 --> 01:05:40,922
Last wish right?
Mr.Sanjeevaiah's last wish?

1023
01:05:43,369 --> 01:05:44,859
Do you even realise what you've done?

1024
01:05:47,306 --> 01:05:48,330
What do you want?

1025
01:05:49,241 --> 01:05:50,208
Money?

1026
01:05:50,309 --> 01:05:51,901
Properties? Power?

1027
01:05:51,977 --> 01:05:53,001
Women?

1028
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:56,241
l would've given you everything..

1029
01:05:59,251 --> 01:06:01,344
My long cherished dream..

1030
01:06:03,288 --> 01:06:04,812
Everything is destroyed..

1031
01:06:12,998 --> 01:06:14,659
Why did you do this to me?

1032
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,524
What did l do to you?

1033
01:06:17,336 --> 01:06:18,928
l don't want anything..

1034
01:06:19,638 --> 01:06:21,697
l've done this for the people
who've trusted and voted us..

1035
01:06:21,807 --> 01:06:27,245
Hope you understand..

1036
01:06:31,984 --> 01:06:40,824
Arjun Prasad..

1037
01:06:40,959 --> 01:06:43,359
Why did you do this.. Why?

1038
01:06:43,962 --> 01:06:45,953
l would have given you everything..

1039
01:06:53,372 --> 01:06:54,805

01:07:22,968 --> 01:07:24,902
There's something about him..

1049
01:07:25,137 --> 01:07:27,002
He might end up changing this country..

1050
01:07:30,742 --> 01:07:32,073
Arjun..

1051
01:07:32,411 --> 01:07:33,844
-Should l come along..
-lt's okay uncle..

1052
01:07:33,946 --> 01:07:35,846
Dhanu needs you
You stay here..

1053
01:07:37,149 --> 01:07:41,984
Politics is not as simple as wearing
designer shirts and having pias..

1054
01:07:42,087 --> 01:07:43,884
Out of experience l am saying
Be careful..

1055
01:07:43,989 --> 01:07:46,457
Sncle, l'm not as experienced as you are..

1056
01:07:46,558 --> 01:07:49,391
But, for me Politics is all
about buying and selling people.

1057
01:07:49,928 --> 01:07:53,557
l don't have to say it to prove it..
Even a kid knows that..

1058
01:07:53,665 --> 01:07:54,927
You take care

1059
01:08:17,322 --> 01:08:22,282
Salutations to Mother lndia!

1060
01:08:23,162 --> 01:08:28,122
Salutations to Mother lndia!

1061
01:08:42,014 --> 01:08:52,117
These are the truths,
Fighting for posts..

1062
01:08:53,959 --> 01:09:04,767
This is the Change that people want

1063
01:09:06,071 --> 01:09:17,107
Raids would make way
for money for peoples' growth

1064
01:09:18,183 --> 01:09:22,847
System of society would change.

1065
01:09:33,232 --> 01:09:34,722
Okay.. okay

1066
01:09:35,634 --> 01:09:37,158
Get a chair..

1067
01:09:39,771 --> 01:09:41,432
-Sit down..
-lt's okay..

1068
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:43,102
You've become CM..

1069
01:09:43,709 --> 01:09:45,006
What do you know?

1070
01:09:45,077 --> 01:09:47,011
And What will you do?

1071
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:50,471
l'll fight corruption
and destroy the caste system..

1072
01:09:50,582 --> 01:09:54,177
Fight against corruption
and elimination of caste system?

1073
01:09:57,856 --> 01:10:03,954
Look, you are the CM of this state..

1074
01:10:04,096 --> 01:10:06,223
Fight against corruption is not a joke..

1075
01:10:06,498 --> 01:10:08,989
For last 60 years.. politicians like
you, have made a joke of it..

1076
01:10:09,101 --> 01:10:10,762
Now it's time for some action.. Peddaina

1077
01:10:11,136 --> 01:10:15,197
Anyway, Don't make a fool of yourself..
And destroy the family esteem..

1078
01:10:16,108 --> 01:10:18,076
Our Family esteem?

1079
01:10:20,679 --> 01:10:22,943
Since you've asked..
l made you a CM..

1080
01:10:23,115 --> 01:10:26,983
Don't let it go to your head..
Protect Dhanu

1081
01:10:27,185 --> 01:10:29,244
He's your cousin..

1082
01:10:29,788 --> 01:10:33,019
Okay Peddaina..
l don't have anything against him..

1083
01:10:33,292 --> 01:10:35,522
Ask him to stay away from me as well..

1084
01:10:59,151 --> 01:11:01,142
Mr. Arjun Prasad is to be sworn
in as the new C.M of the state,

1085
01:11:01,253 --> 01:11:04,780
..in a swearing in ceremony
to be held in Raj Bhavan..

1086
01:11:04,890 --> 01:11:06,915
lt'll be a simple ceremony
minus all the revelry..

1087
01:11:10,796 --> 01:11:11,956
To avoid squandering of public money..

1088
01:11:12,064 --> 01:11:13,725
This decision was taken

1089
01:11:14,966 --> 01:11:18,265
Dhanu Calm down.. calm down..

1090
01:11:19,137 --> 01:11:22,129
You'll not be able to
eliminate him like this..

1091
01:11:26,611 --> 01:11:29,546
-Cool down and listen to me once..
-What is it?

1092
01:11:30,816 --> 01:11:33,751
join Arjun's cabinet as an Home Minister..

1093
01:11:34,986 --> 01:11:37,113
lt will be easy for you to eliminate him..

1094
01:11:38,323 --> 01:11:40,314
Talk to Peddaina
he'll make it happen..

1095
01:11:44,196 --> 01:11:45,254
Peddaina

1096
01:11:45,597 --> 01:11:47,224
At this hour of the day?
ln this rain?

1097
01:11:47,599 --> 01:11:51,035
What brings you here with Dhanu?

1098
01:11:52,304 --> 01:11:55,831
Aunty you are like my mother to me..

1099
01:11:56,675 --> 01:11:58,040
Only you can do this for me..

1100
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:03,342
Nothing much Aunty..

1101
01:12:03,715 --> 01:12:06,980
l should join Arjun's Cabinet
as an Home Minister..

1102
01:12:10,055 --> 01:12:14,992
lt's already.. Peddaina
given to Mr.Venkat Naidu..

1103
01:12:15,093 --> 01:12:17,118
Peddaina spoke to Mr.Venkat Naidu..

1104
01:12:17,229 --> 01:12:18,924
He's ready to take coals and mines..

1105
01:12:19,030 --> 01:12:20,964
Please see that, l get
Home ministry aunty..

1106
01:12:21,066 --> 01:12:23,159
Peddaina, say something?

1107
01:12:43,722 --> 01:12:44,620
Peddaina

1108
01:12:44,723 --> 01:12:46,623
Aunty you've promised me.. That's all

1109
01:12:51,997 --> 01:12:56,127
l lost my husband..
l didn't say anything..

1110
01:12:58,937 --> 01:13:04,136
Now, l can't risk my son's life..
lf Dhanu becomes the Home Minister..

1111
01:13:04,342 --> 01:13:08,369
lt'll be very risky for Arjun..
Don't do this to us..

1112
01:13:09,414 --> 01:13:11,405
He can ask for other portfolio..

1113
01:13:12,083 --> 01:13:14,051
l beg you Peddaina..

1114
01:13:14,186 --> 01:13:15,346
you don't have to do that..

1115
01:13:16,254 --> 01:13:18,154
Peddaina, Dhanu will
be the Home minister..

1116
01:13:20,325 --> 01:13:21,690
Dhanu..

1117
01:13:30,469 --> 01:13:32,096
l Arjun Prasad..

1118
01:13:37,142 --> 01:13:39,201
As the Chief minister of Andhra Pradesh..

1119
01:13:39,344 --> 01:13:43,678
l will honestly and sincerely do my duty..

1120
01:13:43,949 --> 01:13:45,849
l swear in the name of my soul..

1121
01:14:31,062 --> 01:14:32,256
Take your Seat sir..

1122
01:14:33,999 --> 01:14:36,092
-He's Mr.Smesh Gupta..
-Chief Security Officer

1123
01:14:45,143 --> 01:14:46,804
We are your dad's staff..

1124
01:14:52,851 --> 01:14:54,876
All of you will continue
in your same positions..

1125
01:14:59,024 --> 01:15:00,184
They are my friends..

1126
01:15:00,292 --> 01:15:01,919
Guess they are his personal...

1127
01:15:03,061 --> 01:15:05,188
They are not here to collect money..

1128
01:15:05,297 --> 01:15:07,993
They are not brokers..
They are my friends..

1129
01:15:08,099 --> 01:15:10,567
lf you feel embarrassed talking to me
about anything.. you can talk to them..

1130
01:15:12,137 --> 01:15:13,331
Sir.. What's our agenda?

1131
01:15:13,438 --> 01:15:16,407
Fight against corruption,
single point agenda..

1132
01:15:20,245 --> 01:15:21,906
That's it nothing more..

1133
01:15:25,283 --> 01:15:27,080
Mr.Sharma and Smesh, come with me..

1134
01:15:28,219 --> 01:15:32,053
Mr.Sharma.. l need 500 highly qualified
honest people..

1135
01:15:32,390 --> 01:15:34,085
To work with me for one year..

1136
01:15:34,225 --> 01:15:35,385
Salary 5 lakhs per month..

1137
01:15:35,493 --> 01:15:39,054
but, they shouldn't seek a penny more
than the salary.. Can you find them?

1138
01:15:39,164 --> 01:15:43,396
500 honest people..
lts difficult sir..

1139
01:15:44,836 --> 01:15:47,532
lf the salary is 5 lakhs per month..
They'll have to deal in crores..

1140
01:15:47,639 --> 01:15:49,300
When they have chance of making crores..

1141
01:15:49,407 --> 01:15:50,305
5 lakhs will not stop them sir..

1142
01:15:50,408 --> 01:15:53,070
Mr.Sharma are you saying that..
in this entire state..

1143
01:15:53,211 --> 01:15:55,179
we won't be able to
find 500 honest people?

1144
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:57,279
Aren't you ashamed of saying that?

1145
01:15:57,382 --> 01:15:59,009
Why should anyone be honest sir? Why?

1146
01:15:59,117 --> 01:16:01,108
By being honest, who are we helping sir?

1147
01:16:01,353 --> 01:16:03,514
To fill the pockets of these
ignorant politicians..

1148
01:16:03,622 --> 01:16:05,214
why should anyone of us sacrifice?

1149
01:16:05,457 --> 01:16:07,550
We won't find them
Sorry..

1150
01:16:07,659 --> 01:16:09,593
-l was frank in my opinion..
-lt's okay..

1151
01:16:10,228 --> 01:16:12,822
l'm just asking to work honestly..

1152
01:16:12,931 --> 01:16:14,193
not asking for any great sacrifices?

1153
01:16:14,299 --> 01:16:16,961
ln today's time.. working honestly
is a sacrifice in itself sir..

1154
01:16:17,135 --> 01:16:19,103
One minute sir..
One more thing..

1155
01:16:19,237 --> 01:16:21,569
Don't make statements like
fight against corruption etc..

1156
01:16:21,673 --> 01:16:22,640
People are laughing..

1157
01:16:22,807 --> 01:16:25,071
From last 60 years every politician
has been saying the same thing..

1158
01:16:25,343 --> 01:16:29,439
You've become a joke..
The way you dress and the way you talk..

1159
01:16:29,547 --> 01:16:32,573
Moreover, your dad was
an epitome of corruption

1160
01:16:33,318 --> 01:16:35,616
You talking like that sounds like a joke..

1161
01:16:39,891 --> 01:16:44,294
The present Anti Corruption Bureau
will be revamped from a 200 personnel..

1162
01:16:44,429 --> 01:16:47,330
..government department,
to a 2000 personnel cabinet ministry,..

1163
01:16:47,666 --> 01:16:50,191
with special cabinet powers,
and all the necessary amendments..

1164
01:16:50,402 --> 01:16:53,132
..to make these changes will be
tabled in the assembly tomorrow.

1165
01:16:53,705 --> 01:16:55,172
The objective of this ministry is..

1166
01:16:55,273 --> 01:16:59,039
to unearth 1 lakh crores of
black money in the next one year..

1167
01:16:59,144 --> 01:17:01,874
People can see the amount of money
coming into PEOPLE'S FSND.. everyday..

1168
01:17:02,013 --> 01:17:03,002
ln television channels and news papers..

1169
01:17:03,114 --> 01:17:04,206
We start some commotion in the chairs..

1170
01:17:04,349 --> 01:17:05,407
ln the next phase

1171
01:17:05,517 --> 01:17:08,077
We'll account and spend
each and every penny..

1172
01:17:10,622 --> 01:17:13,182
All the information about
the money spent will be seen in the TV

1173
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:16,925
That's all

1174
01:17:26,271 --> 01:17:29,172
You might think that,
l have enough..

1175
01:17:30,508 --> 01:17:33,068
Now, l'm going after others money..
First contribution to our PEOPLE'S fund..

1176
01:17:33,144 --> 01:17:36,113
ls what my dad looted, when
he was in power.. 20,000 crores..

1177
01:17:40,118 --> 01:17:42,916
l'll immediately transfer the
money into PEOPLE'S FSND..

1178
01:17:54,032 --> 01:17:56,125
So, remaining target is 80,000 crores..
Without wasting much time..

1179
01:17:56,234 --> 01:17:57,201
Let's get down with the task..

1180
01:18:03,208 --> 01:18:05,142
The Government has
resolved to fight corruption..

1181
01:18:05,243 --> 01:18:08,144
..and unearth the black money
in the state..

1182
01:18:08,446 --> 01:18:10,641
As a first step.. it has
decided to strengthen ACB..

1183
01:18:10,749 --> 01:18:12,649
..by revamping it into
a 2000 personnel cabinet ministry..

1184
01:18:12,751 --> 01:18:14,480
with independent cabinet powers.

1185
01:18:14,886 --> 01:18:17,150
All the corruption cases
will be moved to..

1186
01:18:17,255 --> 01:18:20,156
..special fast track courts to
avoid delay in the cases.

1187
01:18:20,658 --> 01:18:24,594
Sir.. By tomorrow l'll get you
the 500 honest people.. you asked for..

1188
01:18:24,696 --> 01:18:25,663
You said we won't find them?

1189
01:18:25,764 --> 01:18:28,130
Sir.. l thought we'll never find
a politician like you as well..

1190
01:18:28,233 --> 01:18:29,723
But, we found you..

1191
01:18:30,101 --> 01:18:32,035
ln my 30 years of service..

1192
01:18:32,237 --> 01:18:34,967
l have only seen politicians,
who are corrupt..

1193
01:18:35,073 --> 01:18:38,702
And they've made so much of money that
their next 10 generations don't need to work..

1194
01:18:38,810 --> 01:18:41,711
l've never seen a CM,
who's given up a penny at least..

1195
01:18:42,046 --> 01:18:46,142
History will remember you sir..

1196
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:51,117
Sir.. Your security is very important..

1197
01:18:51,389 --> 01:18:53,084
We have lntelligence reports..

1198
01:18:55,827 --> 01:18:58,625
So.. l'll have black commandos
to give me company.. Okay..

1199
01:19:00,298 --> 01:19:02,994
Sir there is a serious threat
from your own people..

1200
01:19:03,401 --> 01:19:04,629
We also have proofs..

1201
01:19:07,172 --> 01:19:10,369
-But, we'll have serious
political implications.. -Who?

1202
01:19:10,809 --> 01:19:12,299
Dhanunjay is involved sir..

1203
01:19:14,846 --> 01:19:16,108
No..no.. we can't interrogate Dhanu..

1204
01:19:16,214 --> 01:19:18,079
lf we interrogate him
there will be no government..

1205
01:19:18,183 --> 01:19:22,176
lt's a serious threat sir..
please take it seriously..

1206
01:19:22,287 --> 01:19:24,653
First protect me..
We can think of Dhanu later..

1207
01:19:24,756 --> 01:19:28,192
Protect me till l get that money
and also till l spend it for the people

1208
01:19:39,070 --> 01:19:42,062
Arjun.. l am impressed..

1209
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:45,038
Really.. l am very impressed..

1210
01:19:45,176 --> 01:19:47,235
Even if mom scolds it's okay..

1211
01:19:47,312 --> 01:19:49,177
And even though you've not
given any commitment..

1212
01:19:49,314 --> 01:19:50,838
You can kiss me..

1213
01:19:52,083 --> 01:19:54,677
Pleasure is all yours
Pleasure is all yours

1214
01:19:56,588 --> 01:19:58,249
Again.. he's impressed me..

1215
01:19:58,356 --> 01:20:00,517
Given a chance he doesn't
take advantage of it..

1216
01:20:31,522 --> 01:20:34,889
Assassination bid on CM Arjun Prasad
by unidentified gunmen...

1217
01:20:35,159 --> 01:20:37,525
The entire State is shocked at incident..

1218
01:20:37,629 --> 01:20:40,462
But, the CM is safe and
there is no risk to his life..

1219
01:20:42,166 --> 01:20:44,600
Mom.. Come in..
Nothing happened.. Sit down..

1220
01:20:45,203 --> 01:20:47,034
-What happened?
-Calm down, mom.

1221
01:20:47,138 --> 01:20:48,400
lt's okay mom... calm down...
Nothing happened

1222
01:20:49,841 --> 01:20:51,604
You would have been happy in SS...

1223
01:20:51,709 --> 01:20:52,801
lt's all Because of me

1224
01:20:52,911 --> 01:20:54,208
Mom... What happened now?

1225
01:20:54,312 --> 01:20:56,109
All of them are here to protect me...

1226
01:20:56,214 --> 01:20:57,408
Also, l was wearing a bullet proof jacket...

1227
01:21:02,854 --> 01:21:04,344
You go back..

1228
01:21:04,455 --> 01:21:07,288
Honesty is dead in this country...

1229
01:21:07,525 --> 01:21:08,890
lts demons all around here...

1230
01:21:09,260 --> 01:21:11,592
You are not cursed to live with them...

1231
01:21:11,696 --> 01:21:12,788
lt's not a curse mom...

1232
01:21:13,765 --> 01:21:14,663
lt's my destiny...

1233
01:21:15,566 --> 01:21:16,897
There is something about being a CM...

1234
01:21:17,769 --> 01:21:19,464
lt has redeemed me of Anger, resent,..

1235
01:21:19,971 --> 01:21:22,667
..selfishness and everything

1236
01:21:23,308 --> 01:21:24,900
lt redeemed of fear of death as well...

1237
01:21:26,311 --> 01:21:27,335
Don't say that...

1238
01:21:34,185 --> 01:21:35,345
People will spit on your face...

1239
01:21:35,453 --> 01:21:37,819
lf people get to know this..
They'll hurl shoes at you...

1240
01:21:37,922 --> 01:21:39,753
Conspire against him, play politics..

1241
01:21:39,857 --> 01:21:40,949
But, this is not the way..

1242
01:21:41,225 --> 01:21:43,159
You didn't do anything when he
grabbed power from me...

1243
01:21:43,261 --> 01:21:45,957
lnstead you supported him..
Why are you bothered about him peddaina?

1244
01:21:46,531 --> 01:21:47,896
l am furious from within..

1245
01:21:48,566 --> 01:21:51,194
No! l'll not spare him..

1246
01:21:51,369 --> 01:21:54,668
Shut up..
You're getting on to my nerves...

1247
01:21:55,306 --> 01:21:56,534
l am warning you...

1248
01:21:57,241 --> 01:21:59,675
Moreover, l am not bothered about him...

1249
01:21:59,777 --> 01:22:00,766
l am bothered about you..

1250
01:22:02,513 --> 01:22:04,913
lf we don't go and meet him now...

1251
01:22:05,016 --> 01:22:06,813
You'll end up in jail...

1252
01:22:07,218 --> 01:22:10,984
Don't take him for granted...
He'll not keep quiet...

1253
01:22:11,589 --> 01:22:14,217
He almost destroyed you
when he was powerless...

1254
01:22:14,659 --> 01:22:16,889
And now he's a CM..
Come..

1255
01:22:33,945 --> 01:22:34,912
Sister

1256
01:22:46,391 --> 01:22:48,416
-How are you?
-l am fine..

1257
01:22:48,926 --> 01:22:49,893
Rajamma..

1258
01:22:53,998 --> 01:22:55,898
Peddaina..
lt's his first mistake...

1259
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:56,967
l'll forgive him...

1260
01:22:57,335 --> 01:22:59,826
l want his resignation
on my table by tomorrow...

1261
01:22:59,937 --> 01:23:01,234
Otherwise, he'll end up in jail...

1262
01:23:02,473 --> 01:23:05,601
Home Minister Dhanunjay
resigned owning

1263
01:23:05,710 --> 01:23:08,873
Responsibility over the murder
attempt on CM Arjun Prasad..

1264
01:23:17,455 --> 01:23:18,945
This is how our assembly looks...

1265
01:23:19,524 --> 01:23:22,960
Created by the people...
for the people... of the people...

1266
01:23:23,061 --> 01:23:25,928
Our sacred temple, where the destiny
of our people is decided...

1267
01:23:37,608 --> 01:23:38,438
-Greetings, sir!
-Greetings!

1268
01:23:38,543 --> 01:23:40,568
-File sir..
-lt's okay.. -This way..

1269
01:23:42,847 --> 01:23:44,747
This was your dad's seat...

1270
01:23:49,087 --> 01:23:50,816
-See you sir...
-Okay...

1271
01:24:05,069 --> 01:24:05,899
Mr.Speaker

1272
01:24:09,974 --> 01:24:12,966
Bringing out black money and
prosecuting

1273
01:24:13,077 --> 01:24:14,874
Black marketers in Special Courts
immediately.

1274
01:24:14,979 --> 01:24:16,003
That is my proposal.

1275
01:24:16,681 --> 01:24:18,774
-This is not possible and we don't agree,
Mr.Speaker.. -Please be seated..

1276
01:24:18,883 --> 01:24:21,477
Please be seated...
Please be seated...

1277
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:25,814
-CM is speaking, Please be seated.
-Don't accept..

1278
01:24:25,923 --> 01:24:27,481
Mr.CM you continue...

1279
01:24:27,592 --> 01:24:28,889
lncreasing the preview of ACB...

1280
01:24:28,993 --> 01:24:31,359
l'll get all the departments...
All the professionals...

1281
01:24:31,462 --> 01:24:33,930
..including public representatives
under ACB's perview...

1282
01:24:34,031 --> 01:24:35,965
-What the hell are you talking about?
-Please be seated..

1283
01:24:36,067 --> 01:24:38,900
Why do you make a fuss?
Listen to me..

1284
01:24:39,003 --> 01:24:39,833
Please be seated...

1285
01:24:41,539 --> 01:24:43,370
Mr.Srinivas you talk...

1286
01:24:43,474 --> 01:24:47,570
Mr.Speaker, CM is not being clear
about his proposed law...

1287
01:24:47,678 --> 01:24:49,976
There are lots of loopholes in this law...

1288
01:24:50,481 --> 01:24:53,780
The govt will end up
running around the courts...

1289
01:24:53,885 --> 01:24:56,012
lncome Tax is under central Govt.

1290
01:24:56,120 --> 01:24:58,611
How can we meddle in that Mr.Speaker?

1291
01:24:59,090 --> 01:25:00,682
Mr.Speaker that'll not be a problem...

1292
01:25:00,791 --> 01:25:02,418
We'll seek the permission
of the lncome tax

1293
01:25:02,527 --> 01:25:04,688
l've already given all the details,
in the documents l've submitted...

1294
01:25:04,795 --> 01:25:06,922
Mr.Speaker, every year we take
pride in presenting budgets,

1295
01:25:07,031 --> 01:25:08,931
..worth thousands of crores...

1296
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:11,762
But, out of every 100 crores we sanction...

1297
01:25:11,869 --> 01:25:13,632
80 crores are looted by crooks...

1298
01:25:13,738 --> 01:25:15,501
This is the truth and
everybody knows this truth...

1299
01:25:15,606 --> 01:25:16,937
Please be seated..

1300
01:25:18,042 --> 01:25:18,974
Please be seated..

1301
01:25:19,610 --> 01:25:21,771
lt's the truth and everybody
knows this truth...

1302
01:25:22,813 --> 01:25:24,644
We didn't do anything to stop it...

1303
01:25:24,749 --> 01:25:25,841
lnstead, we remained silent spectators...

1304
01:25:25,950 --> 01:25:26,917
lt's a shame on us...

1305
01:25:29,420 --> 01:25:31,980
Snparliamentary language Mr.Speaker...

1306
01:25:32,423 --> 01:25:35,915
Okay... We will remove
shame from the records..

1307
01:25:36,027 --> 01:25:36,925
Mr.CM you continue...

1308
01:25:37,028 --> 01:25:39,496
Corruption and Development
can't go together...

1309
01:25:39,597 --> 01:25:43,897
Our grandfathers said that
we are a Developing Nation...

1310
01:25:44,068 --> 01:25:46,764
Later, our parents
repeated the same thing...

1311
01:25:46,971 --> 01:25:48,632
Today, we're still repeating
the same thing...

1312
01:25:48,973 --> 01:25:51,066
And tomorrow, our grand children
will repeat the same thing...

1313
01:25:51,542 --> 01:25:54,705
When will we call ourselves
a Developed Nation Mr.Speaker?

1314
01:25:55,680 --> 01:25:58,148
We can never call ourself a developed
nation, unless we destroy corruption...

1315
01:25:59,250 --> 01:26:01,650
-Sit down...
-Sit down...

1316
01:26:06,991 --> 01:26:08,652
-Come along...
-Yes sir..

1317
01:26:08,759 --> 01:26:09,953
-How was your first day?
-lt was good Sir...

1318
01:26:10,261 --> 01:26:12,525
-Will the bill be passed?
-No chance

1319
01:26:12,630 --> 01:26:13,426
Greetings sir!

1320
01:26:13,531 --> 01:26:15,556
We're just asking to
punish the criminals..

1321
01:26:15,666 --> 01:26:16,564
What's their problem
in supporting that sir?

1322
01:26:18,936 --> 01:26:22,702
Criminals caught in serious offences..

1323
01:26:23,241 --> 01:26:25,766
..safely walk out of jails in no time...

1324
01:26:25,876 --> 01:26:27,207
We seem to be a doomed state?

1325
01:26:28,179 --> 01:26:31,637
We are just asking for stringent laws...
We're not asking for any personal favors..

1326
01:26:32,183 --> 01:26:33,650
That's why l am saying..

1327
01:26:34,819 --> 01:26:35,649
Come sit...

1328
01:26:35,987 --> 01:26:39,081
You are mistaken there...
We'll be the biggest losers...

1329
01:26:39,190 --> 01:26:40,782
We need corruption...

1330
01:26:41,125 --> 01:26:44,526
lf we make stringent laws like this
and satisfy people...

1331
01:26:44,629 --> 01:26:47,154
We won't have the
opportunity to be corrupt...

1332
01:26:48,499 --> 01:26:50,660
What if people revolt?
Are they fools?

1333
01:26:50,835 --> 01:26:52,132
What if they question us?
What do we answer them?

1334
01:26:52,870 --> 01:26:55,634
Nobody has time for this
question and answer session?

1335
01:26:55,873 --> 01:26:58,967
A guy with his hard earned money
will buy a chicken biryani...

1336
01:26:59,076 --> 01:27:03,137
lf we take away chicken from it,
he'll manage with dal...

1337
01:27:03,247 --> 01:27:06,080
lf we take away the dal...
he'll manage with soup...

1338
01:27:06,250 --> 01:27:10,152
And if we take away the rice, he'll panic...

1339
01:27:10,621 --> 01:27:13,954
Then, we'll give him free rice...

1340
01:27:14,959 --> 01:27:17,951
He'll get very excited and forget
his work and chicken biryani...

1341
01:27:18,062 --> 01:27:19,723
And he'll be our slave forever...

1342
01:27:19,897 --> 01:27:22,866
Nobody wants answers
and this is our policy...

1343
01:27:23,067 --> 01:27:25,092
-But, isn't it wrong?
-No, it's not...

1344
01:27:25,703 --> 01:27:28,035
People aren't expecting anything from us...

1345
01:27:28,272 --> 01:27:30,069
As long as they remain the same,
they'll vote us...

1346
01:27:30,241 --> 01:27:31,936
We should also keep them the way they are...

1347
01:27:32,810 --> 01:27:35,904
They don't have any hope on us and
we don't have any right over them...

1348
01:27:38,015 --> 01:27:39,073
Why are you laughing?

1349
01:27:40,618 --> 01:27:42,279
Nothing... l am wondering,
when you'll die?

1350
01:27:44,055 --> 01:27:45,079
Give me your hand sir...

1351
01:27:46,957 --> 01:27:48,515
You must be around 75-85 years...

1352
01:27:49,827 --> 01:27:51,920
You must have touched
Gandhi with your hands...

1353
01:27:52,330 --> 01:27:54,161
And you must have seen
Nehru with your eyes...

1354
01:27:55,132 --> 01:27:58,101
Your intelligence and experience
is of no use to anyone...

1355
01:27:59,136 --> 01:28:00,865
Since you are usless...

1356
01:28:01,339 --> 01:28:03,534
lt doesn't make any difference,
whether you live or die...

1357
01:28:07,645 --> 01:28:09,203
Listen... help me...

1358
01:28:11,315 --> 01:28:12,646
l don't like you sir...

1359
01:28:20,091 --> 01:28:23,788
-Do you want the bill to get passed?
-Yes sir..

1360
01:28:23,961 --> 01:28:27,362
Then, Exempt MLAs and
politicians from the bill...

1361
01:28:28,099 --> 01:28:29,862
Who taught you boy?

1362
01:28:29,967 --> 01:28:32,868
Will anyone agree to create
a law to prosecute themselves?

1363
01:28:33,637 --> 01:28:36,367
Do as l say, and the bill
will be passed... okay...

1364
01:28:40,044 --> 01:28:41,238
Mr.CM continue

1365
01:28:41,345 --> 01:28:42,972
Mr.Speaker an important amendment...

1366
01:28:44,115 --> 01:28:47,278
l am exempting MLAs and
politicians from his law...

1367
01:28:57,828 --> 01:28:58,954
Continue Mr.CM

1368
01:28:59,063 --> 01:29:01,224
Everyone is aware of our honesty...

1369
01:29:02,333 --> 01:29:05,029
We are immune to laws..
Because, they don't apply to us..

1370
01:29:13,644 --> 01:29:15,111
Atleast now... Smile

1371
01:29:15,346 --> 01:29:17,246
No sir? We've let off the main culprits...

1372
01:29:18,115 --> 01:29:19,047
Very good!

1373
01:29:19,350 --> 01:29:22,114
You don't know the power
of the law you've created...

1374
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:24,915
When you catch hold of all the small fish...

1375
01:29:25,022 --> 01:29:28,651
Sharks will be left with
no food and they'll panic...

1376
01:29:29,193 --> 01:29:33,653
Corrupt are always hungry...
and hunger ones are desperate...

1377
01:29:34,131 --> 01:29:35,928
l'll be happy to have you
charged as well sir...

1378
01:29:36,901 --> 01:29:38,801
Don't be in such a hurry young man...

1379
01:29:40,204 --> 01:29:41,796
There is something about you...

1380
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:45,736
But, you'll not stay for
more than 6 months...

1381
01:29:46,110 --> 01:29:49,375
The moment MLAs get to know your plan..
You'll be out...

1382
01:29:50,047 --> 01:29:54,006
Anyway, today the mood
in the house is positive

1383
01:29:54,118 --> 01:29:55,312
l'm a little satisfied...

1384
01:29:57,121 --> 01:30:00,386
Well said about Gandhi, it hit me hard...

1385
01:30:01,125 --> 01:30:04,959
You were looking forward
for my death right?

1386
01:30:05,062 --> 01:30:07,030
Atleast now, do you think
l deserve to live for another 2-3 years?

1387
01:30:14,138 --> 01:30:15,799
Sir 200 of them...

1388
01:30:19,276 --> 01:30:22,439
We are tapping phones
of their relatives and friends

1389
01:30:28,986 --> 01:30:30,749
First raid the Singur gang...

1390
01:30:40,498 --> 01:30:42,227
What is it?
You haven't washed the clothes yet?

1391
01:30:42,333 --> 01:30:44,233
Don't look at my face like a dumb ass...

1392
01:30:45,336 --> 01:30:46,928
Who is it?
My husband is not at home

1393
01:30:47,471 --> 01:30:49,496
Do you have accounts for all this?
Tell me madam

1394
01:30:51,342 --> 01:30:53,173
No sufferings and no burden

1395
01:30:54,979 --> 01:30:56,879
No king and no poor

1396
01:30:58,282 --> 01:30:59,510
There are gooddays all..

1397
01:30:59,783 --> 01:31:02,081
PEOPLES' FSND tally reaches 22,000 crores...

1398
01:31:05,489 --> 01:31:07,047
CM, he is for poor

1399
01:31:09,026 --> 01:31:10,891
CM, he changes the future

1400
01:31:13,063 --> 01:31:15,964
CM, he is for us

1401
01:31:16,066 --> 01:31:17,761
CM, he is a person among us

1402
01:31:23,140 --> 01:31:25,165
No sufferings and no burden

1403
01:31:26,844 --> 01:31:28,744
No king and no poor

1404
01:31:30,147 --> 01:31:32,012
There are gooddays all..

1405
01:31:32,116 --> 01:31:33,879
My brother-in-law's house
is being raided by ACB guys...

1406
01:31:33,984 --> 01:31:36,953
lf we start raiding our own people then,
what's the need of this Govt?

1407
01:31:38,789 --> 01:31:41,121
PEOPLES FSND, 25,200 crores...

1408
01:31:41,225 --> 01:31:45,821
CM Arjun Prasad has
announced Rs 500/month..

1409
01:31:45,930 --> 01:31:47,955
..to all the kids going to Govt schools...

1410
01:31:48,065 --> 01:31:49,828
CM, he is God to the poor

1411
01:31:49,934 --> 01:31:54,200
PEOPLES FSND totally
reaches 25,200 crores...

1412
01:31:54,305 --> 01:31:55,397
Why is he not meeting us?

1413
01:31:55,506 --> 01:31:57,974
Do you know how much
l've spent for the party fund?

1414
01:31:58,075 --> 01:31:59,975
For two days, l've been
trying to meet him...

1415
01:32:00,077 --> 01:32:01,510
Do you know who am l?

1416
01:32:01,612 --> 01:32:03,170
My brother-in-law
is the Education minister..

1417
01:32:03,347 --> 01:32:05,372
Tell me how much he wants, l'll pay...

1418
01:32:05,482 --> 01:32:07,177
How can they raid me?

1419
01:32:07,284 --> 01:32:11,243
They raid people based on
the money they've looted...

1420
01:32:11,355 --> 01:32:13,585
No...
Why do you push me?

1421
01:32:13,857 --> 01:32:16,382
This CM seems to be sparing no one...

1422
01:32:16,493 --> 01:32:18,085
Please leave me...

1423
01:32:21,365 --> 01:32:22,832
Hello, come here...

1424
01:32:27,871 --> 01:32:29,964
l warned you against this...

1425
01:32:30,074 --> 01:32:33,009
l couldn't stop myself from taking it...

1426
01:32:34,078 --> 01:32:35,170
Dad, all because of you...

1427
01:32:35,613 --> 01:32:38,377
l really feel embarrassed to go to school...

1428
01:32:41,986 --> 01:32:44,887
ACB is carrying out wide spread
raids through out the state...

1429
01:32:44,989 --> 01:32:48,186
But, there seems to be some opposition to
this, from some sections of the society...

1430
01:32:48,292 --> 01:32:53,059
l request all the opposition parties
and the human rights commission,..

1431
01:32:53,163 --> 01:32:55,324
..to come forward and stop
this unruly act by the Govt.

1432
01:32:55,432 --> 01:32:58,026
l'll never vote for this CM

1433
01:32:58,135 --> 01:33:00,194
Film stars, Doctors and Contractors...

1434
01:33:01,238 --> 01:33:03,206
Everybody is being raided...

1435
01:33:05,643 --> 01:33:06,940
Call for a meeting with the lawyers...

1436
01:33:07,044 --> 01:33:11,003
Gentlemen we are fighting corruption
and you are trying to stop us...

1437
01:33:11,115 --> 01:33:12,013
That shouldn't happen...

1438
01:33:13,217 --> 01:33:16,516
No matter what happens,
ACB raids should go on...

1439
01:33:16,620 --> 01:33:17,985
Tell me what you want for that?

1440
01:33:18,088 --> 01:33:21,114
-What CM is implying is...
-No matter what happens

1441
01:33:21,225 --> 01:33:23,318
Govt. should win morally...

1442
01:33:23,427 --> 01:33:25,520
You guys fight the case strongly..
But, should lose the case..

1443
01:33:27,431 --> 01:33:30,662
Mr. Home Minister, how do you
support the Government's actions?

1444
01:33:31,435 --> 01:33:34,996
l myself feel that ACB is going
a little overboard with the raids...

1445
01:33:35,172 --> 01:33:37,663
We plan to take up the issue with the CM...

1446
01:33:45,516 --> 01:33:47,211
Do you people even
realie what's happening?

1447
01:33:47,317 --> 01:33:48,341
just think about it...

1448
01:33:48,452 --> 01:33:51,114
Without your knowledge
and without laying his hands on you,..

1449
01:33:51,221 --> 01:33:52,518
He is hitting you where it hurts the most...

1450
01:33:53,557 --> 01:33:55,889
He is attacking everyone
who you do business with...

1451
01:33:56,026 --> 01:33:57,653
And in no time, he'll come to you..
You'll just keep watching...

1452
01:33:57,928 --> 01:33:59,327
Hello Mr.Dhanunjay

1453
01:33:59,430 --> 01:34:01,898
Sir.. Please come in..
Take your seat..

1454
01:34:02,066 --> 01:34:02,964
You know it right?

1455
01:34:03,067 --> 01:34:03,897
l was just briefing them about the same...

1456
01:34:04,001 --> 01:34:06,265
By now you must have understood, his plot...

1457
01:34:06,370 --> 01:34:08,338
Request you all to
understand the situation...

1458
01:34:09,039 --> 01:34:11,007
We'll bring him down..
We don't want this CM...

1459
01:34:11,108 --> 01:34:13,542
Yes sir, we'll bring him down...

1460
01:34:13,644 --> 01:34:16,670
Long live Dhanunjay...
We'll bring him down...

1461
01:34:16,947 --> 01:34:19,142
lt's time to meet Deputy CM
and Home Minister...

1462
01:34:20,718 --> 01:34:23,050
Sir... They've started to move...

1463
01:34:23,153 --> 01:34:24,984
All the MLAs are in panic...

1464
01:34:25,089 --> 01:34:28,354
We have raided people, who are closely
linked to nearly 73 MLAs...

1465
01:34:28,459 --> 01:34:32,589
There are another 30 MLAs,
who we don't have information about...

1466
01:34:33,430 --> 01:34:34,727
l'll make you CM...

1467
01:34:37,134 --> 01:34:38,101
And you a Home Minister...

1468
01:34:39,136 --> 01:34:40,660
l'll remain as party president...

1469
01:34:41,371 --> 01:34:46,331
l need your support to
bring down Arjun's Govt.

1470
01:34:47,644 --> 01:34:50,670
1 lakh crores of PEOPLES' FSND..
Will be in your hands...

1471
01:34:50,781 --> 01:34:52,078
What is in it for you?

1472
01:34:53,317 --> 01:34:54,750
Arjun's death...

1473
01:34:55,252 --> 01:34:56,219
Sir... They are...

1474
01:34:56,587 --> 01:34:59,351
Any moment from now,
they'll call for a party meeting...

1475
01:35:00,657 --> 01:35:02,682
There motive is not next election sir...

1476
01:35:03,127 --> 01:35:06,153
As far as l know,
Dhanu's motive is to bring you down...

1477
01:35:07,030 --> 01:35:09,999
And MLAs motive is the 1 lakh crores...

1478
01:35:10,367 --> 01:35:12,528
They're just waiting to plunder the money...

1479
01:35:13,704 --> 01:35:15,035
What are we thinking about?

1480
01:35:15,305 --> 01:35:17,273
just get Dhanu killed in an encounter...

1481
01:35:18,142 --> 01:35:20,042
He has ruined so many peoples' lives

1482
01:35:21,011 --> 01:35:22,205
Mr.Smesh, execute that fellow...

1483
01:35:22,312 --> 01:35:23,210
You often do this right?

1484
01:35:23,313 --> 01:35:24,337
We'll get rid off him

1485
01:35:25,149 --> 01:35:26,207
What's Deputy CM's stand?

1486
01:35:26,784 --> 01:35:28,149
This has been his dream sir...

1487
01:35:28,252 --> 01:35:29,685
Dhanu was in his way all this while...

1488
01:35:30,087 --> 01:35:31,145
Now, he's joined him...

1489
01:35:31,455 --> 01:35:33,355
Did they meet Munuswamy?
Will he support them?

1490
01:35:33,457 --> 01:35:34,981
They are going to meet
him in a day or two...

1491
01:35:35,092 --> 01:35:36,616
His MLAs are restless...

1492
01:35:36,794 --> 01:35:40,161
They are terrified about
being raided by the ACB...

1493
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:44,700
lt's high time you meet Peddaina...

1494
01:35:45,202 --> 01:35:46,669
-Peddaina?
-Yes sir..

1495
01:35:47,171 --> 01:35:50,140
l feel its better you meet Peddaina...

1496
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:51,264
lts 1 lakh crores at stake...

1497
01:35:52,643 --> 01:35:54,668
Will they'll plunder 1 lakh crores?

1498
01:35:59,716 --> 01:36:01,206
-Sir, we'll meet peddaina once..
-No need..

1499
01:36:01,318 --> 01:36:02,285
Call for a party meeting

1500
01:36:02,719 --> 01:36:03,686
How will we manage then?

1501
01:36:21,338 --> 01:36:24,466
l apologise on behalf of ACB and myself...

1502
01:36:24,575 --> 01:36:26,600
Snknowingly, we might have
commited some mistakes...

1503
01:36:26,710 --> 01:36:27,734
Forgive me for that...

1504
01:36:27,845 --> 01:36:30,143
We have been ambitiously
pursuing PEOPLES' FSND...

1505
01:36:30,247 --> 01:36:32,841
ln a week or two, we'll hit
the target of 1 lakh crores...

1506
01:36:33,250 --> 01:36:35,844
We've slowly but surely,
started our fight against corruption...

1507
01:36:36,119 --> 01:36:41,079
Today every government employee in all
departments is scared to take a bribe...

1508
01:36:41,391 --> 01:36:42,619
That's our biggest victory...

1509
01:36:43,527 --> 01:36:44,551
Be a little patient...

1510
01:36:44,661 --> 01:36:47,221
ln another 2 years, we'll change
the destiny of this state...

1511
01:36:47,331 --> 01:36:48,491
What nonsense are you talking about?

1512
01:36:48,599 --> 01:36:50,624
You expect us to fight corruption
and stop being corrupt...

1513
01:36:50,734 --> 01:36:52,065
Who the hell are you to preach us?

1514
01:36:52,169 --> 01:36:53,761
What do you think, we are in politics for?

1515
01:36:53,871 --> 01:36:55,361
Come on jama let's leave...

1516
01:36:57,274 --> 01:36:59,435
Otherwise, l'll exempt all your relatives...

1517
01:36:59,543 --> 01:37:01,875
Like everyone who's related to
your families will be exempted...

1518
01:37:02,145 --> 01:37:03,077
Then every one of
you can happily loot people...

1519
01:37:03,180 --> 01:37:05,148
Do we look like crooks to you?

1520
01:37:05,249 --> 01:37:09,083
That's what people call you...

1521
01:37:09,186 --> 01:37:10,778
They call you crooks,
corrupt, opportunist...

1522
01:37:10,888 --> 01:37:12,480
Really, are we not ashamed of ourselves?

1523
01:37:12,589 --> 01:37:14,557
Do we really need 20 cars,
when we can do with 2?

1524
01:37:14,725 --> 01:37:17,159
Do we really need the 100's of acres,
when we can do with 10?

1525
01:37:17,461 --> 01:37:19,554
Can we proudly talk about
the money we have made?

1526
01:37:19,663 --> 01:37:20,891
Can we proudly live?

1527
01:37:21,164 --> 01:37:22,153
We are living like crooks...

1528
01:37:23,734 --> 01:37:26,294
Okay...Okay... Leave it there...

1529
01:37:34,177 --> 01:37:36,771
Forget whatever l've just said...
You people make money...

1530
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:38,370
Make as much as you want...
l'll not stop you...

1531
01:37:38,882 --> 01:37:40,873
But, leave that 1 lakh crores...

1532
01:37:41,952 --> 01:37:46,116
l plead all of you to be patient
for another 1 year...

1533
01:38:15,986 --> 01:38:16,918
Didn't l tell you?

1534
01:38:17,854 --> 01:38:22,553
Politics is not as simple as wearing
designer jeans and having pias?

1535
01:38:22,659 --> 01:38:26,151
Even l told you, politics is
all about buying and selling?

1536
01:38:26,663 --> 01:38:30,155
Sntil you have people like this,
who can be bought...

1537
01:38:38,742 --> 01:38:40,232
You can't say who'll win the battle...

1538
01:38:40,344 --> 01:38:45,179
1 lakh PEOPLES' FSND...
we'll not get another chance like this...

1539
01:38:53,690 --> 01:38:56,682
What is it?
What happened?

1540
01:38:58,462 --> 01:38:59,554
l am losing it mom...

1541
01:39:00,263 --> 01:39:01,821
One more week that's all

1542
01:39:03,033 --> 01:39:04,000
Don't be sad...

1543
01:39:04,735 --> 01:39:06,862
Anyway, you never desired to be a CM...

1544
01:39:07,671 --> 01:39:08,569
Leave it...

1545
01:39:09,606 --> 01:39:10,504
lt's not about Chief Ministership mom...

1546
01:39:10,874 --> 01:39:14,935
l am not bothered about it...
lt's about the people's money...

1547
01:39:15,912 --> 01:39:16,970
Sad, it's ending this way...

1548
01:39:19,282 --> 01:39:21,648
lts 1 lakh crores mom...

1549
01:39:22,619 --> 01:39:24,246

destiny of this state...

1550
01:39:25,355 --> 01:39:26,720
lt's all gone to dogs now...

1551
01:39:32,829 --> 01:39:35,821
Even when dad passed away
you were not so sad ...

1552
01:39:37,334 --> 01:39:40,497
Today, for the fear of
losing people's money,

1553
01:39:41,271 --> 01:39:42,636
l see tears in your eyes...

1554
01:39:43,974 --> 01:39:45,703
l am very proud of you...

Who are you?

1559
01:40:07,898 --> 01:40:09,889
This guy is Mohan... He's a cop...

1560
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,491
l mean cop from a lower caste...

1561
01:40:12,936 --> 01:40:15,700
A girl from his caste was
raped by an MLA's son...

1562
01:40:15,806 --> 01:40:18,502
Since they didn't act against him...

1563
01:40:18,608 --> 01:40:20,508
He's quit his job and he's
on a fasting onto death...

1564
01:40:20,610 --> 01:40:22,510
lts 12 days since he's eaten anything..

1565
01:40:22,612 --> 01:40:24,580
Who are you?
How did you get my number?

1566
01:40:24,815 --> 01:40:25,839
What can l do, at this hour?

1567
01:40:25,949 --> 01:40:28,918
lf you promise him
that justice will be done...

1568
01:40:28,985 --> 01:40:30,885
He'll have something right now...

1569
01:40:30,987 --> 01:40:32,852
Why are you calling me
for this, at this hour?

1570
01:40:32,923 --> 01:40:35,653
lts 00.30 A.M and what can l do?

1571
01:40:35,892 --> 01:40:37,519
Call that social welfare minister...

1572
01:40:37,627 --> 01:40:39,788
You people elected him.. He'll come
and give him juice or whatever..

1573
01:40:39,896 --> 01:40:40,885
Mr.CM please...

1574
01:40:40,997 --> 01:40:42,931
He's in a very bad condition...

1575
01:40:43,066 --> 01:40:44,658
Nobody is coming forward with help...

1576
01:40:44,968 --> 01:40:46,526
Only you can do something about it...

1577
01:40:46,903 --> 01:40:49,599
Moreover he's one of those
honest people, you looking for...

1578
01:40:49,706 --> 01:40:51,298
l don't want him and l don't need him...

1579
01:40:51,408 --> 01:40:54,639
l can't do anything.. lf people really
want honesty, he'll live..

1580
01:40:54,744 --> 01:40:55,642
Otherwise, it's his fate...

1581
01:40:55,745 --> 01:40:58,873
Arjun please... how can you say so...

1582
01:40:58,982 --> 01:41:00,381
Don't irritate me...

1583
01:41:26,910 --> 01:41:28,138
You could have slept inside...

1584
01:41:28,678 --> 01:41:29,975
just fell asleep here... mom...

1585
01:42:06,917 --> 01:42:08,441
Archana is Munuswamy's daughter.

1586
01:42:09,019 --> 01:42:12,011
l want her personal and family
details within 1 hour.

1587
01:42:13,557 --> 01:42:15,889
l think she is covering
Saroja's case in Munigodu.

1588
01:42:19,496 --> 01:42:20,588
But, why do you ask her details?

1589
01:42:20,697 --> 01:42:24,098
ln this situation we need Munuswamy's
support for our government.

1590
01:42:24,701 --> 01:42:27,397
lf we want Munuswamy's support,
she only can do that.

1591
01:42:29,973 --> 01:42:31,804
Her name is Archana..
She's Munuswamy's daughter...

1592
01:42:31,908 --> 01:42:33,739
l mean his illegitimate daughter...

1593
01:42:33,843 --> 01:42:35,538
Very independent...
bought up by her Mother...

1594
01:42:35,645 --> 01:42:39,604
Since her mom's death 4 years ago,
she's staying with her friend in a flat...

1595
01:42:40,517 --> 01:42:44,009
Done her Mass communication
from bishop college Bangalore...

1596
01:42:44,888 --> 01:42:46,788
Presently, she's heading
a television channel...

1597
01:42:47,190 --> 01:42:51,024
Favourite colour is red, favourite game
cricket and a beautiful smile...

1598
01:42:51,761 --> 01:42:52,921
She's a very short tempered girl...

1599
01:42:53,029 --> 01:42:54,462
She doesn't share a good
relationship with her dad...

1600
01:42:54,698 --> 01:42:57,098
She hasn't spoken to him
for the past 12 years...

1601
01:42:59,703 --> 01:43:01,671
But, Munuswamy loves his daughter a lot...

1602
01:43:01,771 --> 01:43:03,739
He'll do anything for her...
That's it sir...

1603
01:43:05,709 --> 01:43:06,676
What about her love life?

1604
01:43:06,910 --> 01:43:09,606
No boyfriends in college days...

1605
01:43:09,946 --> 01:43:13,848
Lot of boys tried to hit on her
But, ended up facing her wrath...

1606
01:43:13,950 --> 01:43:15,747
She likes honest guys...

1607
01:43:15,952 --> 01:43:20,048
But sir, right now a guy is pursuing her...

1608
01:43:20,290 --> 01:43:22,224
-l've seen him...
-ls he an honest fellow?

1609
01:43:22,826 --> 01:43:25,090
He's honestly pursuing her

1610
01:43:28,932 --> 01:43:32,163
You take care of him... For the
next 10 days, he shouldn't meet her...

1611
01:43:32,269 --> 01:43:35,033
Okay sir...
What's our next plan sir?

1612
01:43:35,138 --> 01:43:36,662
-We are going to Vikarabad?
-Why sir?

1613
01:43:36,773 --> 01:43:38,035
You've said she likes cricket right?

1614
01:43:38,208 --> 01:43:39,106
Going there to bowl...

1615
01:43:42,212 --> 01:43:44,942
Where to?
Where is he going?

1616
01:43:45,081 --> 01:43:46,605
He's going on some work...

1617
01:43:46,716 --> 01:43:47,910
Did he get a way out?

1618
01:43:49,919 --> 01:43:53,548
He's trying too hard..
He couldn't sleep the whole night...

1619
01:43:55,659 --> 01:43:57,923
You come with me...
l have some work with you...

1620
01:43:58,728 --> 01:44:00,662
Look Ratna, you need to do me a favour...

1621
01:44:00,930 --> 01:44:02,227
Why should l help you?

1622
01:44:02,332 --> 01:44:04,232
Not me... it'll be helpful to Arjun...

1623
01:44:04,567 --> 01:44:05,966
Then, l'll definitely do it...

1624
01:44:06,970 --> 01:44:09,871
Okay... The plan is..
A guy is planning to propose to his girl...

1625
01:44:09,973 --> 01:44:12,533
You should totally confuse
him and stop him...

1626
01:44:12,842 --> 01:44:14,104
l don't split couples...

1627
01:44:14,978 --> 01:44:16,946
l mean it'll be helpful to Arjun...

1628
01:44:18,281 --> 01:44:19,179
Okay... l'll do it...

1629
01:44:19,582 --> 01:44:22,244
We want justice for Saroja...

1630
01:44:22,352 --> 01:44:27,119
All the culprits involved
should be punished...

1631
01:44:56,052 --> 01:44:56,984
Get the juice...

1632
01:44:58,588 --> 01:44:59,555

1633
01:45:00,924 --> 01:45:02,323
-Why..!
-lt's ok!

1634
01:45:02,592 --> 01:45:03,923
Why are you doing this to yourself?

1635
01:45:04,361 --> 01:45:07,888
Do you promise sir?
Don't pardon them sir...

1636
01:45:13,069 --> 01:45:13,967

01:45:31,654 --> 01:45:33,053
Take him to the hospital immediately...

1639
01:45:41,364 --> 01:45:43,832
-But, you said CM won't be coming?
-Archana... Archana...

1640
01:45:45,068 --> 01:45:47,901
Once you done with your work...
Come and meet me... okay?

1641
01:45:49,739 --> 01:45:50,967
You stay back and get her...

1642
01:45:54,077 --> 01:45:56,944
-CM is calling you..
-We'll take care of all the work... you go...

1643
01:45:57,013 --> 01:45:59,379
When CM himself is calling,
why aren't you going?

1644
01:45:59,849 --> 01:46:01,612
l just don't want to and
l don't need to go?

1645
01:46:01,718 --> 01:46:02,685
Are you cray?

1646
01:46:02,786 --> 01:46:06,244
CM himself is calling you and
moreover he's so handsome...

1647
01:46:13,062 --> 01:46:13,994
What is it now?

1648
01:46:19,736 --> 01:46:20,930
lt's CM who's calling you...

1649
01:46:30,046 --> 01:46:31,707
l was a little tense and
was rude to you yesterday...

1650
01:46:32,048 --> 01:46:34,039
But, thank you... You made me
do something good...

1651
01:46:34,150 --> 01:46:35,913
Everybody has tensions Mr.CM...

1652
01:46:36,352 --> 01:46:39,947
But, only politicians seem
to have the need to lie...

1653
01:46:40,356 --> 01:46:41,755
You consider it's your birthright...

1654
01:46:42,158 --> 01:46:44,183
Thought you were a nice guy
and l called you...

1655
01:46:45,295 --> 01:46:46,125
But, l am hurt...

1656
01:46:46,930 --> 01:46:49,057
lt was my mistake to have believed you...

1657
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:51,967
l am leaving now

1658
01:46:53,503 --> 01:46:54,333
just sit down Archana...

1659
01:46:55,505 --> 01:46:56,904
Will you come out
for a dinner with me?

1660
01:46:57,807 --> 01:46:59,069
ln Hyderabad... it's my treat...

1661
01:47:02,011 --> 01:47:03,876
Hey hey... just sit down...
just listen to me...

1662
01:47:03,980 --> 01:47:05,140
just sit down for a second...

1663
01:47:09,886 --> 01:47:13,253
Sit..! Look, l am a very sentimental CM...

1664
01:47:13,990 --> 01:47:15,924
lf you don't forgive me,
l won't feel like working...

1665
01:47:16,993 --> 01:47:18,961
So, just give me a smile
and agree to the dinner...

1666
01:47:21,231 --> 01:47:24,064
l don't want to...
l hate politicians...

1667
01:47:25,235 --> 01:47:27,931
Don't treat me like a CM...
just treat me like a normal guy...

1668
01:47:28,438 --> 01:47:30,406
l agree l was rude to you...
it was my mistake...

1669
01:47:30,507 --> 01:47:33,340
But, didn't l turn up early in
the morning with my whole team?

1670
01:47:33,443 --> 01:47:34,467
And you're going on and on saying...

1671
01:47:34,744 --> 01:47:36,268
You won't believe me and you hate me...

1672
01:47:36,813 --> 01:47:39,475
You are coming... Tomorrow to water
front, at 8:00 P.M... That's all...

1673
01:48:00,169 --> 01:48:01,898
She's going to meet that guy...

1674
01:48:02,872 --> 01:48:03,930
At 6:00 in the evening.

1675
01:48:08,244 --> 01:48:09,268
Sir, should l stop her?

1676
01:48:11,047 --> 01:48:12,036
Stop her...

1677
01:48:16,386 --> 01:48:18,081
l need to reach Assemble, urgently...

1678
01:48:23,259 --> 01:48:24,920
The country seems to have changed a lot...

1679
01:48:25,395 --> 01:48:26,828
l feel so sad...

1680
01:48:28,097 --> 01:48:30,759
Nobody seems to be
bothered about a girl,..

1681
01:48:30,867 --> 01:48:32,061
..who's been asking for
a lift from last one hour...

1682
01:48:32,569 --> 01:48:33,467
Where is this country heading?

1683
01:48:34,370 --> 01:48:37,271
Actually Mr.Ram, don't think otherwise...

1684
01:48:38,575 --> 01:48:41,408
But, good people like you,..

1685
01:48:42,011 --> 01:48:44,775
..who have concern and love for others,
are very less in number...

1686
01:48:44,881 --> 01:48:46,007
People have become heartless...

1687
01:48:46,883 --> 01:48:47,907
Where is this country heading?

1688
01:48:51,087 --> 01:48:55,080
Today is a very nice day,
l mean, since l've met you...

1689
01:48:59,262 --> 01:49:00,854
You are Rj Ratna Prabha?

1690
01:49:00,964 --> 01:49:02,158
l am your big fan...

1691
01:49:04,934 --> 01:49:06,959
l come across as a very bubbly girl...
always making people laugh...

1692
01:49:07,437 --> 01:49:08,904
But, l am a very sensitive person...

1693
01:49:09,305 --> 01:49:14,072
Always concern about our society
and everything concerned with it...

1694
01:49:18,948 --> 01:49:22,042
Mr.Ram, l will ask you for something...

1695
01:49:22,385 --> 01:49:23,545
You shouldn't say no to it...

1696
01:49:25,054 --> 01:49:25,986
You can ask...

1697
01:49:31,194 --> 01:49:35,995
Will you... have a... cup of coffee with me?

1698
01:49:36,099 --> 01:49:36,929
My treat...

1699
01:49:37,033 --> 01:49:41,231
Somehow, l don't know but,
l feel l am getting close to you...

1700
01:49:57,954 --> 01:49:59,148
Petrol is leaking..

1701
01:50:07,997 --> 01:50:10,488
ls there a service station around?

1702
01:50:10,600 --> 01:50:12,864
There's CM's guest house nearby...

1703
01:50:13,002 --> 01:50:14,560
CM's guest house...

1704
01:50:15,271 --> 01:50:16,863
Sir is playing cricket...

1705
01:50:16,973 --> 01:50:18,031
-You guys can join him...
-What are you thinking about?

1706
01:50:18,141 --> 01:50:19,233
-Don't be adamant...
-Let's go...

1707
01:50:19,342 --> 01:50:21,071
Let's get the luggage...

1708
01:50:24,113 --> 01:50:24,977
Let's go...

1709
01:50:39,529 --> 01:50:40,553
Take the bat...

1710
01:50:50,406 --> 01:50:52,237
Sir, you are looking very simple.

1711
01:50:52,341 --> 01:50:53,171
l am just like you guys...

1712
01:50:53,743 --> 01:50:55,938
Fortunately or unfortunately,
l've become a CM...

1713
01:50:58,548 --> 01:50:59,606
-You play cricket?
-We'll play sir...

1714
01:50:59,716 --> 01:51:00,683

Faking... You shameless...

1803
01:56:25,074 --> 01:56:27,542
Being a CM, you are cheating on a girl...

1804
01:56:27,643 --> 01:56:28,940
-lt must be his idea...
-l don't know..

1805
01:56:29,912 --> 01:56:30,879
l'll kill you...

1806
01:56:33,449 --> 01:56:35,747
l am not cheating her...
lt's a small scheme...

1807
01:56:35,851 --> 01:56:38,046
You are not as innocent
as you seem to be...

1808
01:56:38,320 --> 01:56:39,617
What scheme..?

1809
01:56:40,990 --> 01:56:44,721
Whatever it is... l doubt it...
l can't take a risk...

1810
01:56:44,827 --> 01:56:46,954
Give me my 50 crores...

1811
01:56:50,766 --> 01:56:52,927
l don't need 50... 5 crores are enough...

1812
01:56:53,569 --> 01:56:56,265
After being with you..

1813
01:56:56,372 --> 01:56:57,839
l've atleast started loving my country...

1814
01:56:58,641 --> 01:57:00,666
Transfer the rest into PEOPLES' FSND...

1815
01:57:02,711 --> 01:57:07,341
Look Arjun, if you love
that girl, its okay...

1816
01:57:07,583 --> 01:57:09,813
lf not, don't get physical with her...

1817
01:57:09,885 --> 01:57:12,547
Otherwise, l'll have to rethink
about our relationship.. Okay?

1818
01:57:15,724 --> 01:57:17,885
Thank God... l didn't get
physical with you...

1819
01:57:18,027 --> 01:57:20,860
My mom always warned that,
you guys are heartless...

1820
01:57:24,900 --> 01:57:26,959
Look here...
Come here...

1821
01:57:27,369 --> 01:57:28,097
No boss...

1822
01:57:28,437 --> 01:57:32,100
First give me a commitment...
Only then l'll trust you Arjun...

1823
01:57:54,163 --> 01:57:56,131
l thought its better
you have a personal phone...

1824
01:57:56,398 --> 01:57:57,490
Save my number...

1825
01:57:57,600 --> 01:57:58,532
lt'll have only your number...

1826
01:57:58,767 --> 01:58:03,227
l seek a place in your heart

1827
01:58:06,475 --> 01:58:10,844
But not for the position

1828
01:58:11,147 --> 01:58:13,911
Snless we have a corruption free Govt.
and a disciplined workforce...

1829
01:58:14,016 --> 01:58:16,382
We are not eligible to spend
taxpayer's money Mr.Speaker...

1830
01:58:16,485 --> 01:58:17,315
That's my belief...

1831
01:58:21,891 --> 01:58:26,453
l like to service to the people

1832
01:58:28,564 --> 01:58:32,056
Are you the dear of the nation?

1833
01:58:32,434 --> 01:58:36,029
l'll be a company to you

1834
01:58:36,205 --> 01:58:43,111
Even if you are Abdul Kalam,
l'll be yours

1835
01:58:43,812 --> 01:58:47,646
Hey CM, this state is ok for you.

1836
01:58:47,750 --> 01:58:51,516
But the evening is only for us

1837
01:58:51,620 --> 01:58:57,456
As Priya, l am here to help you

1838
01:59:15,678 --> 01:59:17,771
These statements are
uncalled for right now...

1839
01:59:17,880 --> 01:59:18,710
l warned him Ali...

1840
01:59:19,415 --> 01:59:21,576
For another 10 days
he asked me to keep quiet...

1841
01:59:21,684 --> 01:59:23,242
l've cancelled all his appointments...

1842
01:59:23,419 --> 01:59:25,512
ls CM Arjun Prasad on a Holiday?

1843
01:59:25,621 --> 01:59:27,521
Yes is the answer from CM's office..

1844
01:59:27,623 --> 01:59:29,318
We need to be careful with him...

1845
01:59:29,425 --> 01:59:30,983
He must be planning something...

1846
01:59:31,093 --> 01:59:35,792
PEOPLES' FSND has made him
very popular among people.

1847
01:59:35,898 --> 01:59:39,334
We need to advertise it
as our party's achievement...

1848
01:59:39,435 --> 01:59:41,062
Otherwise, it will be
very difficult to bring him down...

1849
01:59:41,170 --> 01:59:42,535
By the time he's back from his holiday...

1850
01:59:42,638 --> 01:59:43,935
You should become CM...

1851
01:59:44,707 --> 01:59:47,574
ls it nothing between us?

1852
01:59:48,310 --> 01:59:51,575
Doesn't it look good?

1853
01:59:52,181 --> 01:59:59,110
Will get the respect and
honour only when alone

1854
01:59:59,888 --> 02:00:03,449
Life will be bored,
if makes any advance move

1855
02:00:03,659 --> 02:00:07,493
lf controls the mind,
lt gives happy

1856
02:00:07,596 --> 02:00:11,327
Oh my lover!
This is the truth!

1857
02:00:11,467 --> 02:00:15,927
Oh desire! We are made for each other

1858
02:00:19,675 --> 02:00:23,076
Are you the dear of the nation?

1859
02:00:23,379 --> 02:00:27,110
l'll be a company to you

1860
02:00:27,283 --> 02:00:33,916
Even if you are Abdul Kalam,
l'll be yours

1861
02:00:34,923 --> 02:00:38,484
Hey CM, this state is ok for you.

1862
02:00:38,727 --> 02:00:42,458
But the evening is only for us

1863
02:00:42,631 --> 02:00:48,263
As Priya, l am here to help you

1864
02:00:49,772 --> 02:00:53,936
Hey CM, the state won't run away

1865
02:00:54,109 --> 02:00:57,601
But this sweet welcome
won't come tomorrow

1866
02:00:57,780 --> 02:00:58,872
Oh my dear!

1867
02:01:03,185 --> 02:01:07,315
But, Mr.CM what message
are you giving to people by smoking?

1868
02:01:12,928 --> 02:01:14,691
-l quit smoking...
-Sure...

1869
02:01:14,897 --> 02:01:16,592
Ya... lt's for you

1870
02:01:20,669 --> 02:01:22,830
Do you know that
you have a lot of admirers?

1871
02:01:23,772 --> 02:01:25,637
l also have people who hate me Archana...

1872
02:01:27,676 --> 02:01:31,544
l just want to spend that 1 lakh crores,
properly for the people... that's all

1873
02:01:33,282 --> 02:01:36,308
Will the money really
be spent for the people?

1874
02:01:37,319 --> 02:01:38,616
Don't you believe it?

1875
02:01:38,987 --> 02:01:40,784
l believe you Arjun

1876
02:02:16,725 --> 02:02:19,353
This is a brutal and a gruesome act...

1877
02:02:20,229 --> 02:02:21,253
They are innocent people
and what's their fault?

1878
02:02:21,363 --> 02:02:24,924
lt's we, who are at fault... Today l and
my party are ashamed of ourselves...

1879
02:02:25,401 --> 02:02:29,633
For we have appointed an inefficient
man as a CM... Please forgive us...

1880
02:02:41,717 --> 02:02:46,086
You resign... lf you can't manage, resign...

1881
02:02:48,657 --> 02:02:50,750
lf you can't rule the state,
sitting at home...

1882
02:02:50,959 --> 02:02:53,359
l'll show you how a
government should be run...

1883
02:02:53,662 --> 02:02:56,426
l'll rule my people and my state...

1884
02:03:01,403 --> 02:03:02,734
lt's an hour since this attack
and you are coming now,..

1885
02:03:02,938 --> 02:03:05,065
..like you have come for
a fashion parade here?

1886
02:03:05,441 --> 02:03:06,931
Are you not ashamed of yourself?

1887
02:03:07,943 --> 02:03:12,880
Look at them... atleast after seeing
their bodies hope you change...

1888
02:03:17,953 --> 02:03:21,411
He's a doomed CM for us...

1889
02:03:22,491 --> 02:03:24,049
Where are all the intelligence people?

1890
02:03:25,961 --> 02:03:27,826
He must have moved all of them to ACB...

1891
02:03:27,996 --> 02:03:31,193
lf l were a CM, attacks like
this will never happen.

1892
02:03:32,234 --> 02:03:35,795
l'll put myself first in the
line of fire, to save my people...

1893
02:03:36,004 --> 02:03:38,472
l don't have to be a CM...

1894
02:03:38,874 --> 02:03:42,970
To the families of all the people dead
in this incident, l promise a 10 lakhs..

1895
02:03:45,147 --> 02:03:47,138
Sir, Dhanunjay is calling
you an inefficient CM...

1896
02:03:47,282 --> 02:03:48,214
What do you have to say about it?

1897
02:03:48,317 --> 02:03:51,047
This is a brutal attack by the terrorists
and people are in a state of panic...

1898
02:03:51,153 --> 02:03:53,747
And l am not here to
make foolish statements...

1899
02:03:53,889 --> 02:03:54,878
l am the CM...

1900
02:03:58,227 --> 02:04:01,094
Powerful bomb explosion rips
through Lumbini Park..

1901
02:04:01,196 --> 02:04:04,029
..killing 32 people and
severely injuring 120...

1902
02:04:04,199 --> 02:04:06,929
CM has called for an
emergency meeting and..

1903
02:04:07,135 --> 02:04:11,765
..he'll be addressing people
through media in sometime from now...

1904
02:04:12,941 --> 02:04:14,431
Mr.Home Minister... What do we do now?

1905
02:04:14,810 --> 02:04:15,936
We'll order for an enquiry...

1906
02:04:17,179 --> 02:04:21,138
Announce a compensation of 5 lakhs
for dead and 2 lakhs for injured...

1907
02:04:21,283 --> 02:04:24,446
-We'll bear all the medical expenses...
-That's it?

1908
02:04:24,853 --> 02:04:27,845
We'll divert the issue by having
a protest rally accusing Pakistan.

1909
02:04:28,156 --> 02:04:29,145
The issue will get diverted.

1910
02:04:29,491 --> 02:04:32,119
Mr.Home Minister...
What is population of our city?

1911
02:04:34,396 --> 02:04:35,522
80 lakhs sir..

1912
02:04:35,864 --> 02:04:36,956
Our police force?

1913
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:38,964
8000 sir...

1914
02:04:39,301 --> 02:04:40,996
With fewer forces in place, we are
toothless in defending our own citiens..

1915
02:04:41,136 --> 02:04:43,127
We have been asking for this to happen...

1916
02:04:44,139 --> 02:04:45,401
You don't need bullet proof jackets...

1917
02:04:45,507 --> 02:04:47,441
You need conviction...

1918
02:04:48,477 --> 02:04:49,808
lt's the same reaction every time...

1919
02:04:49,978 --> 02:04:52,310
Giving compensation, ordering
for an enquiry and accusing Pakistan...

1920
02:04:52,981 --> 02:04:55,472
Since you are not accountable to people,
you are not bothered about them...

1921
02:04:56,818 --> 02:04:58,115
People are too busy
with their own problems...

1922
02:04:58,420 --> 02:05:01,446
They don't expect to be
bombed by terorists...

1923
02:05:01,957 --> 02:05:03,481
They believe that the
Govt will protect them...

1924
02:05:03,559 --> 02:05:06,960
And we've failed them...
Shouldn't we be ashamed of ourselves?

1925
02:05:08,263 --> 02:05:09,457
lt's a central issue sir...

1926
02:05:12,501 --> 02:05:13,490
So, we don't have to do anything...

1927
02:05:15,037 --> 02:05:16,902
Then, what's your responsibility?

1928
02:05:18,340 --> 02:05:21,400
Revamp all the buildings in city
troubled areas, with 5000 crores...

1929
02:05:21,476 --> 02:05:25,435
Start a new Police Academy
with 10,000 crores, upgrade all weapons...

1930
02:05:25,614 --> 02:05:28,412
ln next 2 years, hire
50,000 police personal...

1931
02:05:28,483 --> 02:05:32,817
But one thing,
Every penny has to be accounted for...

1932
02:05:34,289 --> 02:05:37,850
Accounting every penny?
This is a very big project sir...

1933
02:05:39,061 --> 02:05:40,460
You take 10% commission...

1934
02:05:42,631 --> 02:05:44,462
Or take 20%...

1935
02:06:02,951 --> 02:06:07,183
Hello Chinna... buy 1000 acres
in Shamirpet near our land...

1936
02:06:07,356 --> 02:06:09,916
We are setting up police academy there...

1937
02:06:10,058 --> 02:06:13,994
Don't be so emotional sir...
They'll do business with everything...

1938
02:06:14,096 --> 02:06:17,088
We will speak later the remaining matters.

1939
02:06:19,368 --> 02:06:22,963
Sir, We've information...
Dhanunjay has met peddaina...

1940
02:06:23,105 --> 02:06:24,470
You have to do something sir...

1941
02:06:28,276 --> 02:06:30,471
l'll meet peddaina tomorrow...

1942
02:06:31,380 --> 02:06:33,109
Will not allow those crooks
to take over the power...

1943
02:06:43,592 --> 02:06:46,026
-What is it?
-Mom... l am going to meet Peddaina

1944
02:06:46,495 --> 02:06:47,655
Why at this hour?

1945
02:06:48,997 --> 02:06:50,157
l don't have any other way...

1946
02:06:50,265 --> 02:06:53,029
All the MLAs are revolting...
They are supporting Dhanu...

1947
02:06:53,602 --> 02:06:56,469
l'll beg him to save my Govt.

1948
02:06:57,139 --> 02:06:58,231
Be careful

1949
02:07:00,308 --> 02:07:01,275
See you mom...

1950
02:07:13,221 --> 02:07:15,689
You are on T.V...
You seem to be tense...

1951
02:07:16,024 --> 02:07:17,651
Many young kids were killed...

1952
02:07:18,593 --> 02:07:20,993
Dhanu is exploiting the situation...

1953
02:07:21,196 --> 02:07:23,255
And media is also not being supportive...

1954
02:07:24,966 --> 02:07:30,927
l was also angry with you...
l mean, you left in a hurry that's why...

1955
02:07:32,074 --> 02:07:33,336
Should l tell you something?

1956
02:07:36,378 --> 02:07:39,211
You are the best CM...
All politicians pretend to be leaders...

1957
02:07:39,948 --> 02:07:43,543
But, you are not like them...
There is lot of honesty in you...

1958
02:07:44,252 --> 02:07:46,186
That's why... you are the best...

1959
02:07:46,488 --> 02:07:49,184
Archana, will you come with me?

1960
02:07:50,058 --> 02:07:53,550
l mean, l am on my way
to village to meet Peddaina...

1961
02:07:57,332 --> 02:07:58,060
Should you ask?

1962
02:08:04,239 --> 02:08:06,537
Or mine..?

1963
02:08:10,178 --> 02:08:15,616
lt means not interested..?
or Not willing..?

1964
02:08:16,284 --> 02:08:18,650
Or hurting..?

1965
02:08:21,389 --> 02:08:32,391
ls it the silence of euphony?

1966
02:08:33,335 --> 02:08:45,372
ls it the writings over water?.

1967
02:09:22,818 --> 02:09:28,415
When stars go the distance,
there will be the sky

1968
02:09:28,723 --> 02:09:34,025
lf tears flow down,
it may be the lightning

1969
02:09:34,729 --> 02:09:40,395
There will be joy at dawn
where earth and sky meets

1970
02:09:40,669 --> 02:09:46,005
When l come near you,
why do you move away?

1971
02:09:46,174 --> 02:09:51,942
l've got you as my company

1972
02:09:52,080 --> 02:09:57,882
And our glance has met together

1973
02:09:58,086 --> 02:10:03,854
l've got you as my accompany

1974
02:10:04,059 --> 02:10:09,861
And our glance has met together

1975
02:10:10,665 --> 02:10:19,539
ls it for this, oh Priya?
ls it for this?

1976
02:10:29,784 --> 02:10:33,550
This is the village which was
destroyed by my family

1977
02:11:01,316 --> 02:11:02,146
Are you cray?

1978
02:11:02,284 --> 02:11:06,220
This is the kind of welcome
Sanjeevayya's son deserves...

1979
02:11:06,421 --> 02:11:08,150
Ask him, Why he's here?

1980
02:11:08,890 --> 02:11:10,915
He must have come to beg us for votes...

1981
02:11:14,863 --> 02:11:16,831
No not for votes...
l've come to meet you people...

1982
02:11:16,965 --> 02:11:18,830
just get lost.
We have seen many people.

1983
02:11:20,535 --> 02:11:24,198
We don't want to meet you... lf you
come back, we'll hurl shoes at you..

1984
02:11:25,206 --> 02:11:26,195
Let's go...

1985
02:11:27,642 --> 02:11:30,873
Archana you freshen up...
But, why did you come in between?

1986
02:11:31,179 --> 02:11:32,339
l deserve this...

1987
02:11:34,716 --> 02:11:38,243
You are our CM...
And we should be protecting you

1988
02:11:48,697 --> 02:11:50,358
l can't cheat her Ali...

1989
02:11:50,999 --> 02:11:52,227
She's a very nice girl...

1990
02:11:53,401 --> 02:11:55,835
-l feel guilty...
-Sir, what's this?

1991
02:11:57,205 --> 02:11:58,638
We are already late...

1992
02:11:58,807 --> 02:12:00,206
We'll are losing it sir...

1993
02:12:00,342 --> 02:12:01,536
The party is meeting tomorrow...

1994
02:12:02,544 --> 02:12:04,637
Don't be emotionally right now...

1995
02:12:06,381 --> 02:12:08,849
Sir, just go and propose her...

1996
02:12:08,984 --> 02:12:10,246
She likes you a lot...

1997
02:12:10,452 --> 02:12:13,683
That's the problem...
What to do?

1998
02:12:14,689 --> 02:12:16,179
Ali, l can't cheat her...

1999
02:12:16,391 --> 02:12:18,859
l will tell her the truth
and ask for her help

2000
02:12:19,227 --> 02:12:20,251
What if she doesn't agree?

2001
02:12:22,630 --> 02:12:26,691
No Ali... she'll be fine and she'll agree...

2002
02:12:27,268 --> 02:12:28,667
-Sir...
-Believe me

2003
02:12:32,240 --> 02:12:36,939
Look at the list of the
demands they've made

2004
02:12:37,245 --> 02:12:39,213
The reserve bank will go bankrupt
to fulfill all the demands...

2005
02:12:48,990 --> 02:12:50,958
Guess you've been roaming
around the whole village?

2006
02:12:51,326 --> 02:12:57,026
lnstead of coming home directly,
why did you go to the dalit ghettos?

2007
02:12:57,332 --> 02:12:59,766
lts okay, go and take a shower.
We'll have lunch...

2008
02:13:00,035 --> 02:13:02,526
Make arrangements for his shower...

2009
02:13:02,804 --> 02:13:04,032
l am fine... l don't need a shower...

2010
02:13:04,339 --> 02:13:06,000
You don't have to tell me...

2011
02:13:06,307 --> 02:13:07,934
You've been to an untouchables place...

2012
02:13:08,410 --> 02:13:13,643
You being to S.S and being a CM,
doesn't change things here...

2013
02:13:14,049 --> 02:13:15,414
Go take a shower and come.

2014
02:13:16,818 --> 02:13:19,651
ln 60 years of independent lndia...
Sntouchablity

2015
02:13:19,921 --> 02:13:23,357
This is barbarism and how dare...

2016
02:13:23,925 --> 02:13:25,517
Are these people governing us?

2017
02:13:25,894 --> 02:13:27,020
Are they the ones in power?

2018
02:13:27,562 --> 02:13:29,655
Am l supporting these kinds of people?

2019
02:13:29,764 --> 02:13:32,028
No! l should take them to task...

2020
02:13:32,901 --> 02:13:34,892
They don't have the right to govern us...

2021
02:13:35,603 --> 02:13:36,661
This is injustice...

2022
02:13:37,105 --> 02:13:39,266
They don't even have the right to live...

2023
02:13:40,575 --> 02:13:42,566
Ali, get me a good diamond ring...

2024
02:13:42,811 --> 02:13:44,369
l'm proposing to Archana today itself...

2025
02:13:44,646 --> 02:13:45,738
You were right...

2026
02:13:46,047 --> 02:13:49,710
lf we take it easy, these demons
will come back to loot us...

2027
02:14:12,073 --> 02:14:14,007
-Hi CM...
-Why do you call like that?

2028
02:14:14,409 --> 02:14:16,536
When l find you very cute,
l'll call you that...

2029
02:14:17,745 --> 02:14:18,712
Haven't you slept yet?

2030
02:14:18,913 --> 02:14:20,972
-No... Waiting
-Did you eat?

2031
02:14:21,082 --> 02:14:22,913
No... Waiting

2032
02:14:23,384 --> 02:14:25,818
-Let's go
-Come...

2033
02:14:39,033 --> 02:14:40,557
l need to say something to you...

2034
02:14:41,069 --> 02:14:41,967
Even l need to tell you something...

2035
02:14:42,403 --> 02:14:43,734
Let me say it first

2036
02:14:50,378 --> 02:14:51,709
l'll close my eyes and say it...

2037
02:14:56,584 --> 02:14:59,985
l've been waiting for you
to say this to me...

2038
02:15:00,455 --> 02:15:02,423
But you are taking lot of time...

2039
02:15:02,690 --> 02:15:04,715
So, l think it's about time
one of us says it...

2040
02:15:05,059 --> 02:15:08,392
lnstead of wasting time,
l thought l'll say it...

2041
02:15:57,111 --> 02:15:58,840
Come on, what kind of a CM are you?

2042
02:15:59,047 --> 02:16:03,984
l closed my eyes and opened
my heart to say, l love you...

2043
02:16:04,719 --> 02:16:06,118
You didn't even give me a kiss...

2044
02:16:22,070 --> 02:16:26,131
Everyone calls you a jeans CM...
But, you're a dumb CM...

2045
02:16:29,477 --> 02:16:30,466
Come...

2046
02:16:37,218 --> 02:16:43,953
Actually l hate politicians but,
l never thought that l'll end up with one...

2047
02:16:44,559 --> 02:16:46,151
Your dad is also a politician

2048
02:16:49,030 --> 02:16:51,055
l meant to ask whether
you told him about us

2049
02:16:52,600 --> 02:16:54,568
l told my mom... so.

2050
02:16:54,769 --> 02:16:57,465

Let's welcome the spring

Let the woes which
came as promises, vanish

2069

Let swing the comet in the hairdo

2070
02:18:51,018 --> 02:18:56,115
Let forget the sufferings in romance

2072
02:19:02,296 --> 02:19:08,098
lt rained, bloomed
and the thunder bolt came

2073
02:19:20,314 --> 02:19:25,877

Or mine..?

2075
02:19:40,802 --> 02:19:41,427
Archana madam...

Her phone signal is blocked right?

Nobody will be able to reach
her till the party meeting is over...

2090
02:21:13,995 --> 02:21:15,519
She'll never forgive me...

2091
02:21:17,164 --> 02:21:21,533
Sir... lf she knows you well enough,
she'll never desert you...

02:21:55,036 --> 02:21:56,162
Sir... actually

As long as l am here, nobody
will be able to bring you down...

2100
02:21:59,507 --> 02:22:01,475
Let them do what they want to, we'll see

2101
02:22:03,110 --> 02:22:04,475
What was their offer to you sir?

2102
02:22:04,845 --> 02:22:05,903
Forget about it...

2103
02:22:06,047 --> 02:22:07,844
We are a family now...

2104
02:22:08,249 --> 02:22:10,149
They offered...
to make Deputy CM as the CM

2105
02:22:10,351 --> 02:22:12,080
10,000 crores share from the 1 lakh crores

2106
02:22:12,186 --> 02:22:14,814
2 cabinet berths...
And lot of other stuff...

2107
02:22:16,023 --> 02:22:17,786
-But, l just need one favour
-Tell me

2108
02:22:17,925 --> 02:22:19,552
My party member Buchiramayya's son..

2109
02:22:19,827 --> 02:22:22,557
..should be cleared from
the murder & rape case...

2110
02:22:24,332 --> 02:22:25,856
What are you thinking about?

2111
02:22:26,534 --> 02:22:28,024
He's a very important member of our party

2112
02:22:28,135 --> 02:22:30,797
-He can make or break our party
-Can we settle this with money?

2113
02:22:30,972 --> 02:22:32,496
lt's not about money here...

2114
02:22:32,840 --> 02:22:38,335
lf we don't release his son,
we'll have lot of problems

2115
02:22:40,648 --> 02:22:41,979
just a minute sir...

2116
02:22:45,319 --> 02:22:46,479
Sir... sir... accept it sir...

2117
02:22:47,021 --> 02:22:48,045
We are running out of time...

2118
02:22:56,230 --> 02:23:00,189
How can l protect a criminal,
who ruined a girl's life?

2119
02:23:01,102 --> 02:23:02,501
They're very poor people Mr.Sharma...

2120
02:23:03,270 --> 02:23:05,170
They live in forests...

2121
02:23:05,873 --> 02:23:07,636
They pleaded me for help,
l gave them my word

2122
02:23:08,042 --> 02:23:11,011
But sir, all our efforts will go to vain...

2123
02:23:11,612 --> 02:23:15,013
1 lakh crores of PEOPLES' FSND
will go into those crooks hands

2124
02:23:15,149 --> 02:23:16,241
We don't have a choice sir...

2125
02:23:21,188 --> 02:23:23,315
Sir... Accept it...

2126
02:23:25,559 --> 02:23:27,026
Don't hesitate, sir...

2127
02:23:27,528 --> 02:23:31,988
Mr. Sharma, l'll never forgive
myself for this in my life

2128
02:23:36,537 --> 02:23:39,563
l've never come across a CM like this...

2129
02:23:39,674 --> 02:23:42,507
-Have anyone of you come across?
-No... No... We haven't...

2130
02:23:42,677 --> 02:23:45,043
He abuses our own MLAs
in the Assembly house...

2131
02:23:45,546 --> 02:23:47,241
Doesn't have any respect for the party?

2132
02:23:48,049 --> 02:23:51,109
Moreover, he sends lncome Tax notices
to our MLAs and their family members

2133
02:23:53,220 --> 02:23:55,313
No scheme... No policy...

2134
02:23:55,423 --> 02:23:58,085
No new programme... No project proposal

2135
02:23:58,192 --> 02:24:01,059
And what did he really do
for the last one year?

2136
02:24:01,395 --> 02:24:02,623
Everyday

2137
02:24:03,230 --> 02:24:05,130
He acts like a money-mongering devil...

2138
02:24:05,232 --> 02:24:07,291
1 Lakh crores! 1 Lakh crores!

2139
02:24:07,401 --> 02:24:08,299
That's it!

2140
02:24:09,203 --> 02:24:11,000
From being a CM, he's stooped down
to being a collection agent!

2141
02:24:11,105 --> 02:24:12,572
What a shame!

2142
02:24:13,674 --> 02:24:15,642
Do we really need a CM like this?

2143
02:24:15,743 --> 02:24:17,108
No... no!... we don't

2144
02:24:17,378 --> 02:24:20,176
The respect you have for Mr. Sanjeevayya...

2145
02:24:20,981 --> 02:24:23,142
Hope you've understood
what politics is all about...

2146
02:24:26,754 --> 02:24:32,192
lt's a game of snakes and ladders...

2147
02:24:33,294 --> 02:24:36,127
Had you left to S.S,
you wouldn't have had these problems..

2148
02:24:36,430 --> 02:24:40,526
You stuck in it now...
Snless he destroys you, he'll not rest...

2149
02:24:45,039 --> 02:24:45,698
Sncle...

2150
02:24:46,674 --> 02:24:50,633
ln politics, you can buy people
with money, caste or relationship..

2151
02:24:51,345 --> 02:24:52,642
Till now, l was buying with money...

2152
02:24:53,414 --> 02:24:55,177
Now, l'm buying with relationship...

2153
02:24:55,683 --> 02:24:57,116
Basically buying is common

2154
02:24:58,052 --> 02:25:00,384
Ask him to come to point
without wasting time...

2155
02:25:02,223 --> 02:25:05,454
l propose the Deputy CM as our new CM

2156
02:25:13,434 --> 02:25:17,165
Hello Peddaina... Munuswamy here...

2157
02:25:17,571 --> 02:25:19,402
lf you want my support

2158
02:25:26,213 --> 02:25:27,646
You are not getting it Mr. Munuswamy...

2159
02:25:28,482 --> 02:25:30,507
He is fooling you and
your daughter as well...

2160
02:25:31,085 --> 02:25:33,246
Your daughter will tell the truth,
what's her number?

2161
02:25:34,054 --> 02:25:36,022
Everyone is not like you Mr. Dhanunjay...

2162
02:25:38,259 --> 02:25:39,385
What do you want sir?

2163
02:25:40,060 --> 02:25:41,322
We've settled everything right?

2164
02:25:41,695 --> 02:25:43,094
What's your problem now?

2165
02:25:43,197 --> 02:25:44,721
lf 10 is not okay?
Take 20 thousand crores...

2166
02:25:45,065 --> 02:25:46,589
Take 3 more portfolios...

2167
02:25:47,067 --> 02:25:48,796
But, Arjun should not be the CM!

2168
02:25:49,069 --> 02:25:50,263
l don't mind even if a Dog
becomes next CM...

2169
02:25:50,371 --> 02:25:51,668
What the hell are you talking?

2170
02:25:52,773 --> 02:25:55,105
Peddaina, you make him understand...

2171
02:25:55,309 --> 02:25:56,674
just get one thing clear...

2172
02:25:56,777 --> 02:25:58,472
lf you want my support

2173
02:25:58,712 --> 02:26:00,339
My son-in-law... Arjun should be the CM

2174
02:26:00,447 --> 02:26:02,210
To hell with you and your son-in-law!

2175
02:26:02,650 --> 02:26:03,674
You are nothing without us?

2176
02:26:04,084 --> 02:26:05,551
And you support your damn son-in-law!

2177
02:26:06,520 --> 02:26:08,351
You are a street dog that
feeds on our biscuits!

2178
02:26:08,455 --> 02:26:10,184
Mind your damn tongue!

2179
02:26:11,058 --> 02:26:12,150
Respect! Be careful

2180
02:26:12,359 --> 02:26:13,519
To hell with your respect

2181
02:26:13,694 --> 02:26:14,718
Dhanu... what the hell?

2182
02:26:27,575 --> 02:26:35,038
lf Munuswamy withdraws his support,
we need to face elections...

2183
02:26:35,516 --> 02:26:36,813
Shall we?

2184
02:27:11,652 --> 02:27:13,119
What took you so long?

2185
02:27:17,291 --> 02:27:20,283
And there was no signal to call you...

2186
02:27:25,199 --> 02:27:27,292
Hey, any problem?

2187
02:27:30,671 --> 02:27:31,899
Hey, signal is back...

2188
02:27:32,239 --> 02:27:33,263
Archana don't pick up...

2189
02:27:36,777 --> 02:27:37,744
Hello Miss Archana...

2190
02:27:38,279 --> 02:27:39,268
This is Dhanunjay...

2191
02:27:55,796 --> 02:27:59,357
Lie... lt was all a lie right?

2192
02:28:00,601 --> 02:28:02,296
Everything was a big lie right?

2193
02:28:02,403 --> 02:28:05,270
Archana my love for you is not a lie...

2194
02:28:05,873 --> 02:28:11,277
Mom always told me
not to believe politicians...

2195
02:28:11,879 --> 02:28:14,575
She must be sad for me up
in the heaven now...

2196
02:28:16,550 --> 02:28:18,279
Was this ploy needed?

2197
02:28:19,320 --> 02:28:22,153
Being a CM, why did you use..

2198
02:28:22,990 --> 02:28:27,893
...this ploy to cheat a
simple girl like me?

2199
02:28:28,329 --> 02:28:32,265
lf you had asked me,
l would have supported you...

2200
02:28:39,006 --> 02:28:41,634
Archana... please listen to me...

2201
02:28:42,009 --> 02:28:43,169
l am fighting...

2202
02:28:43,544 --> 02:28:48,914
l am fighting for a cause, to spend
the people's money for the people...

2203
02:28:50,617 --> 02:28:52,847
All the courts, laws and
politicians are against me...

2204
02:28:54,021 --> 02:28:56,512
But, l am still fighting...

2205
02:28:57,358 --> 02:28:59,223
ln this fight, l don't know
what's right

2206
02:28:59,493 --> 02:29:01,859
...and what's wrong and l've
forgotten about my own self...

2207
02:29:02,262 --> 02:29:04,196
You are thinking that, l've cheated you...

2208
02:29:04,298 --> 02:29:06,823
But the truth is... l've cheated myself...

2209
02:29:09,269 --> 02:29:10,236
There was no other way...

2210
02:29:10,671 --> 02:29:11,638
l couldn't risk...

2211
02:29:12,239 --> 02:29:13,570
l couldn't take a risk
with people's money...

2212
02:29:15,275 --> 02:29:18,210
Every politician who doesn't have
a conscience says the same thing...

2213
02:29:18,479 --> 02:29:21,243
For the want of power, money
or for the family,..

2214
02:29:22,016 --> 02:29:24,007
..every politician says the same thing...

2215
02:29:24,752 --> 02:29:26,276
Get lost Arjun...

2216
02:29:26,487 --> 02:29:28,717
l got the truth

2217
02:29:28,889 --> 02:29:31,722
Don't worry... l will not talk
about this with anybody

2218
02:29:32,493 --> 02:29:38,295
lt rained, got bloomed
and thunder bolt came

2219
02:29:39,333 --> 02:29:40,027
Go away...

2220
02:30:02,056 --> 02:30:04,786
-Yes... who are you?
-l'm Ramu

2221
02:30:05,325 --> 02:30:08,385
MLA Buchiramaiah's son
You called for me sir...

2222
02:30:08,896 --> 02:30:10,261
Frankly tell me...

2223
02:30:10,697 --> 02:30:13,689
Confidential
Did you murder her?

2224
02:30:14,968 --> 02:30:16,299
We were drunk sir...

2225
02:30:16,437 --> 02:30:17,597
We were in a good mood...

2226
02:30:18,038 --> 02:30:20,666
Saw a hot girl, we just had fun...

2227
02:30:20,774 --> 02:30:21,604
And murder?

2228
02:30:22,976 --> 02:30:24,671
She was creating a lot of fuss...

2229
02:30:25,312 --> 02:30:26,939
Was very stubborn...

2230
02:30:27,981 --> 02:30:29,448
She was not ready to compromise...

2231
02:30:29,616 --> 02:30:31,311
We offered her a lot of money...

2232
02:30:34,888 --> 02:30:36,788
Will leave now...
A small request...

2233
02:30:36,957 --> 02:30:38,652
Dad is hosting a party...

2234
02:30:38,759 --> 02:30:41,023
Celebrating my release...
You should surely come sir

2235
02:30:46,500 --> 02:30:49,469
lf your dad wasn't an MLA,
Or if l didn't help you,

2236
02:30:49,570 --> 02:30:51,003
Do you even realie
what punishement you'd have got?

2237
02:30:51,105 --> 02:30:52,094
But, why wouldn't you help us sir...

2238
02:30:52,439 --> 02:30:53,406
All of us are together in this...

2239
02:30:53,907 --> 02:30:55,807
You help us and we help you... its mutual...

2240
02:30:57,111 --> 02:30:58,339
Any regret...

2241
02:30:58,445 --> 02:31:00,675
Do you at least regret
for what you've done...

2242
02:31:00,848 --> 02:31:02,076
Why should l regret sir?

2243
02:31:02,349 --> 02:31:04,044
lt'll stay in public memory for 2 days

2244
02:31:04,451 --> 02:31:06,351
They'll forget about it...
They'll find a new case...

2245
02:31:06,720 --> 02:31:07,744
Not about you...

2246
02:31:07,855 --> 02:31:09,948
-Do you regret for her life?
-Nothing sir

2247
02:31:10,057 --> 02:31:13,049
She's a small fish but, a beautiful fish...

2248
02:31:14,495 --> 02:31:15,860
Ramu come here

2249
02:31:24,571 --> 02:31:26,732
Since your dad is an MLA,
you got away with it...

2250
02:31:27,141 --> 02:31:28,108
At least, remember this!

2251
02:31:28,442 --> 02:31:31,002
Go
Out!

2252
02:31:52,666 --> 02:31:53,496
Mom..!

2253
02:31:55,402 --> 02:31:57,063
What is it?
Come here..

2254
02:32:07,181 --> 02:32:08,079
What happened?

2255
02:32:10,184 --> 02:32:11,014
Mom..!

2256
02:32:11,985 --> 02:32:12,952
What is it son?

2257
02:32:17,224 --> 02:32:19,954
Mom.. Today to save my position,

2258
02:32:20,661 --> 02:32:23,186
l let off a criminal who
destroyed a girl's life...

2259
02:32:27,100 --> 02:32:28,431
l didn't have a choice mom...

2260
02:32:30,170 --> 02:32:32,104
You've done injustice to a girl?

2261
02:32:33,540 --> 02:32:35,132
l just let off a criminal mom...

2262
02:32:36,877 --> 02:32:40,404
lf you think you've just let off
a criminal, it's okay...

2263
02:32:42,082 --> 02:32:44,812
But, by letting him off,
you've done injustice to a girl...

2264
02:32:45,719 --> 02:32:49,485
And that's what is sad, very sad...

2265
02:32:51,992 --> 02:32:56,827
Now, you decide whether
you're okay with it or sad about it...

2266
02:32:58,532 --> 02:32:59,692
l didn't have a choice mom...

2267
02:33:00,234 --> 02:33:02,168
Dad also used to say
the same thing...

2268
02:33:02,603 --> 02:33:03,763
lt's not like that mom...

2269
02:33:04,104 --> 02:33:05,162
lt's the same thing...

2270
02:33:06,873 --> 02:33:08,101
Today it's a rape case...

2271
02:33:08,242 --> 02:33:09,709
Tomorrow it'll be a murder case...

2272
02:33:10,210 --> 02:33:11,837
Next it'll be about a factory license...

2273
02:33:12,212 --> 02:33:13,577
After that it'll be about a land...

2274
02:33:14,681 --> 02:33:16,842
Like that you'll not have
a choice in anything...

2275
02:33:22,723 --> 02:33:24,623
Arjun, go to sleep now...

2276
02:33:24,925 --> 02:33:26,153
We'll talk about this tomorrow...

2277
02:33:26,793 --> 02:33:29,626
Take some rest... go...

2278
02:33:37,738 --> 02:33:42,266
l always wanted you
to be a LEADER, not a politician..

2279
02:33:48,115 --> 02:33:49,104
Mom...

2280
02:33:58,692 --> 02:34:00,057
Arjun, dear.

2281
02:34:06,867 --> 02:34:08,630
Oh gosh..!

2282
02:34:24,685 --> 02:34:28,519
This is the land of women..

2283
02:34:28,622 --> 02:34:34,652
..-their milk flows to make
the land virtuous. -Mom!

2284
02:34:47,708 --> 02:34:51,269
We've owned this nation.

2285
02:34:51,378 --> 02:34:55,007
Praise it, my brother!

2286
02:35:14,634 --> 02:35:18,661
Many women from different villages
have come to see your mother sir...

2287
02:35:19,773 --> 02:35:21,297
lf you can meet them once...

2288
02:35:24,411 --> 02:35:26,311

All Poor and helpless...

All these years, your mother supported them
and gave them a new lease of life sir..

2292
02:35:56,410 --> 02:35:58,241
Let the nation's glory spreads to all
-She's a God to them sir...

2293
02:35:58,345 --> 02:36:01,109
Let the nation history shines
-One lakh women...

2294
02:36:01,214 --> 02:36:04,149
Oh my brother,

2295
02:36:04,251 --> 02:36:07,948
..who have got forgotten.

2296
02:36:08,054 --> 02:36:11,820
Oh my brother,
sing about the freedom-fighters..

2297
02:36:11,925 --> 02:36:15,292
..who have got forgotten.

2298

..their milk flows to make virtue the land

2300
02:36:23,136 --> 02:36:27,072
We've owned this nation.

2301
02:36:27,174 --> 02:36:30,803
Praise for it, my brother!

2302
02:36:30,911 --> 02:36:34,677
We've owned this nation.

2303
02:36:34,781 --> 02:36:37,181
Praise for it, my brother!

2304
02:36:37,284 --> 02:36:39,445
People are dying Arjun...

2305
02:36:39,719 --> 02:36:42,085
They're tired of these politicians...

2306
02:36:42,189 --> 02:36:44,089
Give them a small hope Arjun...

2307
02:36:44,157 --> 02:36:48,821
l always wanted you to be a Leader,
not a politician...

2308
02:36:50,197 --> 02:36:51,027
Please sit...

2309
02:36:52,132 --> 02:36:53,121
lt's okay..
You sit down...

2310
02:37:00,774 --> 02:37:01,798
lt's ok!

2311
02:37:01,975 --> 02:37:02,999
You please be seated.

2312
02:37:05,846 --> 02:37:07,677
l am the CM...

2313
02:37:10,417 --> 02:37:14,148
-Who's this girl?
-Victim's sister...

2314
02:37:15,989 --> 02:37:18,150
She was too scared to stay alone at home

2315
02:37:18,258 --> 02:37:19,316
So l got her along sir...

2316
02:37:20,861 --> 02:37:23,022
lt was a mistake on our part,
in your elder daughter's case...

2317
02:37:24,231 --> 02:37:26,062
You tell me, how can we correct it?

2318
02:37:26,166 --> 02:37:27,827
He's a criminal...

2319
02:37:28,068 --> 02:37:30,332
And he should be punished, that's it sir...

2320
02:37:30,437 --> 02:37:31,836
Nothing more can be done...

2321
02:37:32,205 --> 02:37:34,230
Will l get back my daughter?

2322
02:37:35,275 --> 02:37:36,469
We'll leave now sir...

2323
02:37:37,010 --> 02:37:40,707
-We won't get a bus if it gets too dark...
-Just a minute...

2324
02:37:42,482 --> 02:37:43,744
l too lost someone...

2325
02:37:44,351 --> 02:37:45,511
You all stay with me...

2326
02:37:46,119 --> 02:37:47,313
l'll take care of her education...

2327
02:37:47,787 --> 02:37:48,811
Will get her married...

2328
02:37:48,989 --> 02:37:52,049
-l'll take care of her like my own sister...
-No sir...

2329
02:37:52,158 --> 02:37:53,125
Why?

2330
02:37:53,426 --> 02:37:54,950
CM himself is promising you...

2331
02:37:55,262 --> 02:37:56,889
We don't trust him sir...

2332
02:37:56,997 --> 02:37:57,827
Please don't mind...

2333
02:37:59,366 --> 02:38:01,459
CM himself is giving his word...

2334
02:38:02,002 --> 02:38:03,970
CM himself went back on his word...

2335
02:38:04,070 --> 02:38:06,197
We don't trust him anymore sir...

2336
02:38:08,141 --> 02:38:09,768
The MLA from our village...

2337
02:38:10,076 --> 02:38:12,044
He will soon be a minister too...

2338
02:38:12,312 --> 02:38:15,110
Who'll make him understand?

2339
02:38:15,215 --> 02:38:18,343
That he should treat the girls of his
village, as his own daughters...

2340
02:38:19,519 --> 02:38:23,353
When they brutally raped
and killed my daughter...

2341
02:38:24,457 --> 02:38:27,756
Your CM shamelessly defended those beasts...

2342
02:38:27,861 --> 02:38:29,089
That's what you people are...

2343
02:38:29,429 --> 02:38:32,023
We've completely lost trust
in you people sir...

2344
02:38:33,934 --> 02:38:35,196
l'll at least drop you in my car...

2345
02:38:35,435 --> 02:38:36,333
No thank you sir...

2346
02:38:36,503 --> 02:38:37,765
We'll go in the bus...

2347
02:38:38,004 --> 02:38:39,028
There will be people around, it's safer...

2348
02:38:44,311 --> 02:38:45,835
Can we do justice to him?

2349
02:38:46,212 --> 02:38:47,770
Legally we can't do anything...

2350
02:38:48,281 --> 02:38:49,407
Not legally Smesh...

2351
02:38:50,216 --> 02:38:51,342
As a friend, do me a favour

2352
02:38:57,223 --> 02:38:58,053
Mr. Sharma

2353
02:38:59,259 --> 02:39:02,194
ln half an hour, pass orders
to our 2000 officers...

2354
02:39:02,295 --> 02:39:04,422
At sharp 6'o clock in the
morning tomorrow, start raiding!

2355
02:39:04,531 --> 02:39:08,831
Every MLA, MP, every so-called
public representative, raid everyone!

2356
02:39:08,935 --> 02:39:09,833
Don't leave anyone

2357
02:39:10,003 --> 02:39:11,595
Their family, friends, everyone!

2358
02:39:13,206 --> 02:39:15,197
Mr. Smesh, you provide them
with complete police protection

2359
02:39:15,308 --> 02:39:16,332
Sir... but...

2360
02:39:16,443 --> 02:39:18,274
Mr. Sharma, we can't
confiscate their property,..

2361
02:39:18,378 --> 02:39:21,040
..but we can show their
illegal earnings to the people...

2362
02:39:21,147 --> 02:39:23,115
Run hourly news scrolls on TV...

2363
02:39:23,283 --> 02:39:25,478
-What about government? -We don't
have to worry about it Mr. Sharma..

2364
02:39:27,520 --> 02:39:29,920
Take an appointment
with governor at 8 p.m tomorrow...

2365
02:39:30,323 --> 02:39:31,847
By 8 p.m, all raids should be completed...

2366
02:39:31,958 --> 02:39:33,983
Mr. Smesh, l want him dead at 8:10...

2367
02:39:38,198 --> 02:39:40,564
A CM shouldn't be unlawful, right?

2368
02:39:44,671 --> 02:39:46,070
Sir please think about it again...

2369
02:39:50,243 --> 02:39:52,177
A CM, who couldn't do justice
to an innocent poor girl,..

2370
02:39:52,278 --> 02:39:54,143
..doesn't deserve to remain a CM...

2371
02:39:55,215 --> 02:39:57,149
l am an incompetent CM,
in an incompetent system!

2372
02:39:57,951 --> 02:39:59,418
This is not what the people
want Mr.Sharma...

2373
02:40:00,654 --> 02:40:04,215
Crores of funds, big projects,
food or electricity

2374
02:40:04,457 --> 02:40:06,857
This is not what the people want
People want Change!

2375
02:40:07,327 --> 02:40:08,294
Change in the System!

2376
02:40:08,395 --> 02:40:09,293
Change in the ldeologies!

2377
02:40:09,396 --> 02:40:10,624
Change in Politics!

2378
02:40:11,264 --> 02:40:12,231
Ali, let's go

2379
02:40:20,907 --> 02:40:23,205
l see a true LEADER in you sir!

2380
02:40:30,250 --> 02:40:32,377
This country has never seen
a true LEADER like you sir...

2381
02:40:56,543 --> 02:40:59,205
GEMlNl NEWS. ln a way never
seen before in the history of the state,

2382
02:40:59,312 --> 02:41:04,579
Today at 6 a.m, ACB raided all MLAs
and public representatives houses...

2383
02:41:34,214 --> 02:41:37,706
Surpassing the total amount of black money

2384
02:41:37,984 --> 02:41:41,511
just for one day today, the black money
collected in raids was Rs.80,000 Crores

2385
02:41:52,699 --> 02:41:55,395
For the first time in independent lndia,
impossible seems to be possible...

2386
02:41:55,502 --> 02:41:56,662
And the dream has come true...

2387
02:41:56,770 --> 02:41:59,398
Proving that nobody is above the law,..

2388
02:41:59,506 --> 02:42:01,371
..including the politicians
and public representatives...

2389
02:42:01,474 --> 02:42:05,069
The total black money unearthed
in the raidings today,..

2390
02:42:05,178 --> 02:42:08,636
..has left not only the state
but the entire country shocked!

2391
02:42:08,748 --> 02:42:12,650

resigned just some time back...

2392
02:42:12,752 --> 02:42:17,212
He will meet the governor tonight at 8
and submit his resignation letter...

2393
02:42:39,646 --> 02:42:43,104
The MLAs, MPs and Ministers got
stung by dramatic raids carried out..

2394
02:42:43,216 --> 02:42:47,084
..by ACB commissioned by CM Arjun Prasad...

And these are all our MLAs...

2399
02:42:56,830 --> 02:42:57,728
We can form the government sir...

2400
02:42:57,831 --> 02:42:59,025
Hello Sir...

2401

Another shock to Dhanunjay...

2404
02:43:17,383 --> 02:43:19,283
After supporting the government
for the last three years...

2405
02:43:19,385 --> 02:43:23,549
Munuswamy withdraws his support...
And open the door for elections

2406
02:43:25,225 --> 02:43:26,317
Did you call me Peddaina?

2407
02:43:32,832 --> 02:43:34,163
What's all this?

2408
02:43:34,834 --> 02:43:36,324
What are you up to?

2409
02:43:37,704 --> 02:43:40,468
For the past 30 years,
l've given my blood,

2410
02:43:40,640 --> 02:43:46,203
my family everything
and built this empire...

2411
02:43:46,579 --> 02:43:49,104
You've destroyed it in a jiffy...

2412
02:43:49,582 --> 02:43:51,743
Wasn't it your government?

2413
02:43:52,252 --> 02:43:53,742
Then, why did you do this Arjun?

2414
02:43:54,153 --> 02:43:55,347
We can't make the dead walk Peddaina...

2415
02:43:55,455 --> 02:43:56,547
We'll have to bury them...

2416
02:43:58,324 --> 02:43:59,348
You guys are not right...

2417
02:43:59,459 --> 02:44:00,892

2423

Do we really need a manifesto
to spend people's money for the people?

2430
02:45:15,034 --> 02:45:18,526
We've been doing it for the past 60 years
