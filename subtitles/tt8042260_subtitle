1
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,760
'Apple of my eye; my dearest'

2
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,920
Why is uncle going overboard
with his sacred antics?

3
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,200
I don't know who he'll target
this year to tarnish their life

4
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,680
Why is your house locked?

5
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,880
What are you doing here?

6
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,800
Where is your interest due?

7
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,080
- I'll pay you soon, sir
- What's with you?

8
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,440
What is this disguise?

9
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,000
Lord Karna, sir

10
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,000
You are unable to pay
the interest for your loan

11
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,640
And you'll dress up
as the generous king Karna, huh?

12
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:31,800
"In the paddy fields lush and green
Indian beech trees with flowers seen"

13
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:39,160
"In the highways bustling with activity
tamarind trees blossom in plenty"

14
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:46,080
"In directions 8, everywhere
our neem trees rustle with fanfare"

15
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:54,480
"Knowing you'll be coming, at that moment
the flowers open their eyes in excitement"

16
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:01,360
"One who graced Vaigai river as our savior
Our Chozhavandhan Mariamma we favor"

17
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,120
"Shall I receive You with love?"

18
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,560
"Our Goddess who came from above"

19
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:15,440
"Shall I welcome You with happiness
One who wears a garland of durva grass?"

20
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:20,920
"Shall I invite You with gratitude forever
One who cures chicken pox in the summer?"

21
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,640
"Come, o' Goddess of rain"

22
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:40,360
"The leafy canopied ghaf tree
was cut down with utmost sanctity"

23
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,840
"To carry my favorite deity
carved as a casket sturdy"

24
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,240
"Inside that wooden casket
my kohl lined deity basked"

25
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,200
"Epitome of fury
Avatar of Kali"

26
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,280
Do you know how our Mariamma
was enclosed in that casket?

27
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:02,280
"One with turmeric paste applied
With dhavanam's perfume alongside"

28
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:07,960
"Shall I call my deity to bless us
The copper statue so wondrous?"

29
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,680
"Come, Goddess Shakthi"

30
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,320
At a time when there was no famine
when pangs of hunger attacked us

31
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:32,200
When all these people assembled
and wondered what to do

32
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,120
Lord Krsna commanded Varuna
the God of rain and said

33
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,680
Shower rain in abundance

34
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,600
Heavy rains lashed
flooding the land it seems

35
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,960
The casket with our Goddess
carried by the ripples of the Palar river

36
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:49,480
In the waters sweet as honey
floats the casket of our Mariamma

37
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,240
Your casket slides to the banks green
with the waters gently lapping in between

38
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,080
When everyone wondered
what this casket contained

39
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,120
Our deity Mariamma dear
to bring us prosperity here

40
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:07,160
"Goddess in a casket, shall I welcome You?
The renowned one, who comes to our rescue"

41
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:12,520
"Shall I welcome You, avatar of Shakti?
One with name and fame in totality"

42
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,120
"Goddess Cholavandhan Mariamma"

43
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,760
"Our Chozhavandhan Mariamma, our savior
Our Goddess whom we fear and favor"

44
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,480
"Shall I welcome our Sornamuthu Mariamma?"

45
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,360
Tell now

46
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,560
Announce your presence

47
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,640
Within a year
in your family

48
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,600
...you'll face a problem
with either a lady or land

49
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,840
Wake up!

50
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,360
Good morning, madam

51
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,720
Welcome

52
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,920
- Greetings, madam
- Good day

53
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,560
Welcome, madam

54
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,360
Hello

55
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,280
Thank you

56
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,080
Come this way

57
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,200
Please take your seat
All the best

58
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,760
Namaste, madam

59
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,560
Best wishes, madam

60
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,280
Good wishes

61
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,840
Good morning, madam

62
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,520
Good morning, madam

63
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,040
You should be in that seat
But you have seated her

64
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,800
Attend to your work

65
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,440
Lot of loans are pending

66
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,720
Many have not repaid

67
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,720
Loans approved on document basis
have also been forged

68
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,600
Who approved this?

69
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,520
Why haven't so many farmers
paid back their loans?

70
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,680
Who will take up
the responsibility of this loss?

71
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,640
Madam, the problem here is-

72
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,560
Villagers are not soft like the city bred

73
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,960
They may be a bit violent

74
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,560
I am mentioning this because many
of our officers had bad experiences

75
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,640
Where there is honesty
both anger and violence co exist

76
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,840
It's alright

77
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,080
We'll face that too

78
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,560
So bring all the pending files to my notice

79
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,120
- Okay
- Okay, madam

80
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:05,920
Thank you!

81
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,760
It's rare nowadays for girls
to work in villages

82
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,200
Why are you scaring them?

83
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,520
Will they dole out loans
with open arms in your city?

84
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,400
Don't be unrealistic

85
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,200
Appa, look who is here

86
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,640
You are dead meat today
He'll close your chapter

87
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,600
Uncle, stop it

88
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,320
Stop it, all of you

89
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,920
How can you do such injustice?

90
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,560
What did I do?

91
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,760
How often should I repeat it?

92
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,880
Even Americans use a neem stick
as tooth brush

93
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,040
The world is going green

94
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,880
If I say all this
do I look like a fool to you, huh?

95
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,800
You are a genius
But leave us alone

96
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,640
Natural fertiliser won't be
conducive to this soil

97
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,280
This land has got used to this manure

98
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,600
I can't repay my loan
if I don't harvest 3-4 times a year

99
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,960
Change your habit

100
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,800
Yov! This is our Mother earth

101
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,600
Even if you stamp,
doesn't she support you and me?

102
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,200
For that at least
shouldn't we protect her?

103
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,240
All our documents are
collaterals in a pawnshop!

104
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,560
Wonder who jinxed me this morning

105
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,000
Why are you bugging me
while I am working?

106
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,040
Couldn't you find anyone else today?

107
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,480
Why are you perturbed?

108
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,960
I'll gladly give you
earthworm fertilizer for free

109
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,560
Just say yes, I'll bring it
from my house and pile it here

110
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,560
Please don't use those chemicals

111
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,880
Don't betray the soil that trusts you

112
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,200
You don't understand my plight

113
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,160
I've bought all this fertiliser on loan

114
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,800
Aiyo!

115
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,800
Uncle, I don't intend leaving
till you change your mind

116
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,960
Kanna, what are you doing here?

117
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,840
We've been looking for you all over

118
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,320
Look at what uncle is doing

119
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,800
Didn't he promise to use
only organic manure that day?

120
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,240
Look what he is up to now

121
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,760
Sir, I didn't think
when I promised that day

122
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,120
Please forgive me

123
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,480
Uncle, we can't keep forgiving you

124
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,560
For the next harvest
change to natural fertiliser

125
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,840
- Say 'yes'
- I swear I'll change

126
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,800
I'll buy organic manure from you

127
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,520
Leave me alone now, sir

128
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,600
You heard him
Let's go, Kanna

129
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,200
Let's attend to our work

130
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,080
Muthu, how are you?

131
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,080
Hey Kanna
Nowhere to be seen

132
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,440
I saw you in the temple that day
You left before I could talk to you

133
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,720
That's a big story

134
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,760
By the way where is your husband?

135
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,000
- Where will he go?
- Come, Kanna

136
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,240
- Would you like some tea?
- I just drank, Chandra

137
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,880
- Buttermilk
- No, it's alright

138
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,160
Hey Kanna, you are
a smart young boy

139
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,120
Why are you still
roaming around single?

140
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,000
Karuppu, you tag along always

141
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,680
Can't you find a girl for him?

142
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,760
You expect them to?

143
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,680
If they are with me, even a girl
who flips for me will flee

144
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,360
- Hey Chandra
- What, Kanna?

145
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,280
Count the coconuts
and unload them

146
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,880
I'll buy whatever price you quote

147
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,200
When have I bargained with you?

148
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,320
Whatever Muthu says is fine with me

149
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,600
If the buyer fixes the price
their sales is really one of a kind!

150
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,200
He is my childhood friend

151
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,160
Now you know what trust means?

152
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,520
Kanna, let me look for a bride

153
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,120
Don't worry
if I don't find one

154
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,080
I'll divorce my husband
and gladly marry you

155
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,400
Kindly do me this favor
Take her with you

156
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,960
If you succeed
I'm freed of a life sentence

157
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,600
Don't think you can
escape from me, dear

158
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,760
That will never happen

159
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,080
Am I the pawn in your game?

160
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,040
Hey Karuppu, are they serious
or is it their weird sense of humor?

161
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,000
They were classmates
Don't be suspicious

162
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,080
Okay, let's go
Muthu, see you

163
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,480
- Send me the money
- Prompt as usual

164
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,800
Muthaiyah has taken 8 loans

165
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,360
He has repaid 4

166
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,360
Kazhuvaayi has taken 5 loans

167
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,960
And repaid 2

168
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,040
Kamala Kannan has taken
9 loans for his cattle

169
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,720
Not repaid even 1

170
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,880
There isn't even a gap of
2 months between each loan

171
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,120
Who approved his loans?

172
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,520
There are many adjustments
in this locality

173
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,880
If you delve too deep into it

174
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,680
...VAO, collector, tahsildar
the whole system will oppose us

175
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,920
Forget how it was given and
focus on retrieving the money

176
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,120
Sir, we can't use local thugs
like private banks do

177
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,280
Madam, most of them who availed
loans here are proper thugs

178
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,400
Let it be

179
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,360
I won't step back from taking
the required legal action

180
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,120
I need to meet each and every one of them

181
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,640
- And we will start with Kamala Kannan
- Okay, madam

182
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,080
Did you drive the tractor
or roll it in mud?

183
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,200
Full of muck and mire

184
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,200
Who listens to you here?

185
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,400
Our vehicle is their training tool!

186
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,280
Kamala Kannan sir,
I'm Vetri Kumaran

187
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,000
- From Madurai Grama Bank
- I know you

188
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,560
We would like to discuss
about your cattle loans

189
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,360
We are paying the dues

190
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,880
Even sir knows it

191
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,920
Who paid?

192
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,000
Records don't show a single payment

193
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,560
She is our new manager

194
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,080
Her name is Bharathi

195
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,560
Good afternoon, madam

196
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,760
Namaste, Mr Kamala Kannan

197
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,480
You look educated

198
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,000
But why are you doing this?

199
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,680
You own a lot of property

200
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,200
Should you avail Govt loans
and cheat them?

201
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,080
Can't you lead a straightforward life?

202
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,000
I can understand
if you really can't repay

203
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,720
By greasing their palms...

204
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,960
...isn't there a limit to
indulging in fraudulent deals?

205
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,840
If I have done anything wrong
I'll face it legally

206
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,960
See, let me keep it very simple

207
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,120
If you don't repay your loan
I'll take action

208
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,080
So be careful

209
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,640
Kanna, you must slap her
at least once

210
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,120
'What temerity!'

211
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,040
She dares to come here
and threaten us

212
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,800
'She should be taught a lesson'

213
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:22,240
Many of them who take loans
have no intention of repaying

214
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:26,120
They wait for a new Govt
to dissolve their loans

215
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,400
I'm not targeting the poor
who can't repay

216
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,880
I just can't bear to see the affluent ones
who trick the Govt through loans

217
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,600
Fraudsters!

218
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,960
That isn't true
Miss Bharathi

219
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,760
If we handle those with clout
in a diplomatic manner

220
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,440
...it augurs well for us

221
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,840
Will big shots have 2 horns or what?

222
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,960
Will they pierce us?

223
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,720
I'm not scared of all this

224
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,880
It is my duty

225
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,560
This is just a simple
cattle loan of a villager

226
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,440
What will you gain
by intervening and investigating?

227
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,040
How can you take
a cattle loan so lightly?

228
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,400
Do you know the worst corruption
in India is cattle fodder?

229
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,040
In our country cows are
the biggest problem

230
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,640
People's taxes are used as loans

231
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,880
We stretch our hands for our salary
Shouldn't we do justice to it?

232
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,200
When those who cheat are brave
why should we be scared cowards?

233
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,680
Hey, wait right here
I'll be back

234
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,360
Bro, what about your security?

235
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,840
Dai! 1st take care of the car

236
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,720
Don't come inside
Stay in the car

237
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,120
Our bro doesn't look
the least bit angry

238
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,280
He'll bottle it up inside

239
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,840
Thanks

240
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,160
- Mathrabootham sir
- Tell me, madam

241
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,200
Ask why Kamala Kannan
of Vadipatti is waiting out?

242
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,040
Kamala Kannan sir
Come here 1 minute

243
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,680
What are you waiting for?

244
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,640
Madam wants to know the reason

245
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,000
I want to thank madam

246
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,720
Madam, he wants to thank you

247
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,280
Thank me? Why?

248
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,720
I didn't ask
Shall I ask him?

249
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,040
It's okay, ask him to come

250
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,720
She asked you to go in

251
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,000
- Tell me
- Madam

252
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,440
I repaid 2 loans
as per your suggestion

253
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,680
- When will you pay the balance?
- Give me some time

254
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,920
I'll repay one by one

255
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,240
Do it fast

256
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,840
What you've done is forgery

257
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,560
Repay before I take any action

258
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,960
Why do you need to thank me?

259
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,160
You said 'Can't you lead an honest life?'

260
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,600
I liked that a lot

261
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,920
I have work to do

262
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,440
Thank you so much

263
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,120
We need signatures from 2 witnesses
for our Home's registration

264
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,280
You are here
The other witness is on the way

265
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,440
Good morning

266
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,240
Namaste
Congratulations

267
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,400
Madam, please sign

268
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,600
I really feel very proud

269
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:32,200
This Old Age Home is being registered
as Mother Teresa's Home

270
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:38,960
I thank Miss Bharathi
of Madurai Grama Bank

271
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:45,800
And my dear friend Kamala Kannan
advocator of organic farming

272
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,920
I ask our friend Kamala Kannan
to say a few words now

273
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,400
Good morning to everyone

274
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,960
Brother Chozha Nagarajan referred
to this as Old Age Home

275
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,920
This isn't an Old Age Home
But Care for the Elderly

276
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,480
Old age is an unavoidable phase
to every human being on earth

277
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,240
For those who have reached
that stage before us

278
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,280
I firmly believe this care center
will provide all the required comfort

279
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,320
Thank you

280
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,280
See you, bro

281
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,760
What is this place?

282
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,200
If parents had a son like you
this is the haven they must seek!

283
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,040
Zip your lips and open the door

284
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,880
Should I explain
even an Old Age Home to you?

285
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,600
'Our guest in today's farmers' program
is Kamala Kannan from Vadipatti'

286
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,720
'Greetings'

287
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,840
'How did you get interested
in organic farming?'

288
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,840
'When I was studying
in Agricultural college'

289
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,640
'...I grew up reading books by Nammalvar
agricultural scientist and green crusader'

290
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,240
'Johan Fredrik of Germany
and our own Gandhiji'

291
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:50,480
'I was enlightened, I felt
only we can save our own land'

292
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,680
'Why shouldn't I give this
my full fledged support?'

293
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,440
'So this became my dream'

294
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,160
'Farming alone won't do
We need organic manure'

295
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,680
'We are producing
earthworm fertilizer'

296
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,680
'Our earthworms will save our soil
that was ruined by chemicals'

297
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,320
'People are leaning towards
natural organic farming methods'

298
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,880
'What do you think?'

299
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,720
'I'm very happy people prefer
the 'Go Green' movement'

300
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,400
'This boosts up my faith
in my dream even more'

301
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,720
'I am sure a change is
just round the corner'

302
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,920
Bill it please

303
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,640
- Yes, madam
- Vetri sir

304
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,920
Kamala Kannan has graduated
in Agricultural science in Madurai

305
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,760
He belongs to an agricultural lineage

306
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,120
He's a landlord too

307
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,200
Why should he avail 9 cattle loans?

308
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,920
I feel something is fishy

309
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,360
If you are in doubt
we can enquire, madam

310
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,520
- You go and find out
- Okay, madam

311
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,680
Who the hell is this?

312
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,040
Why are you honking
in front of a locked gate?

313
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,720
- We were sleeping
- What do you want?

314
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,320
Madam wants to inspect
all the cows for your cattle loans

315
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,040
Big shots can't show up
Take the nonentities

316
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,680
Both of you go

317
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,000
Bro, don't come to the road
and get caught, that's all I can say

318
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,200
Go now, don't I know
you're Kasi's son?

319
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,920
- Are you a pilot?
- I'll tweak your ear

320
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,280
He's a Govt employee
That's how he'll talk

321
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,200
- Let's attend to our work
- Our work is to go back to sleep!

322
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,160
Watch your step

323
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,880
This cow

324
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:03,960
Here, huh?

325
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,400
Take care

326
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,240
Namaste

327
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,280
We are from the bank
Is this your cow?

328
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,880
Yes, sir
My son is a drunkard

329
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,800
His liquor ate up all our lands

330
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,040
We can't pay our house rent

331
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,360
I have pledged
all my possessions

332
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,840
I was struggling without even
1 square meal a day

333
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:29,120
Kamala Kannan lad came to my rescue
and availed a cattle loan for me

334
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,040
Due to the circumstances
and our situation I couldn't repay

335
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,280
Don't blame Kamala Kannan

336
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,920
Please ensure you won't hassle him

337
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,760
He's like a son to me

338
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,760
Thanks to him
we are able to survive

339
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,840
May God bless him

340
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,680
I'll show you the next candidate

341
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,040
Let's go

342
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,160
My parents were well diggers

343
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,360
My father died while digging a well
He fell prey to a mudslide

344
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,560
My mother and I were
somehow making ends meet

345
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,320
I was working in a telephone booth
Not a well paid job

346
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,640
Kamala Kannan said

347
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,440
'Don't worry, Mary
I'll help out'

348
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:09,960
He got us a cattle loan and
that's how we are making ends meet

349
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,680
We'll pay up very soon
Don't ask him to pay this

350
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,240
Please wait, madam
I'll pay definitely

351
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,880
- I'll take leave
- Okay, madam

352
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,240
I told you I'll repay all my loans

353
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,160
Why did you go to their houses
and threaten those poor souls?

354
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,000
Kannan sir, madam wanted
a clear picture about your loans

355
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,440
That's why we went
It's our duty, sir

356
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,520
- Yes, madam
- Ask him to come in

357
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,760
You can go in and talk to madam

358
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,880
Sir, you feel like donating
Do it with your own money

359
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,640
Why do charity
with bank's money?

360
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,160
This isn't charity
It's a job opportunity for them

361
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,360
If you give them cash
they will spend it

362
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,360
They will be focused in their work
if they have to repay the bank

363
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,240
That's why I got them a cattle loan

364
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,120
Haven't you heard of
the fish and bait story?

365
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,760
Give the bait
and not the fish

366
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,320
That's what I did

367
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,480
Please don't go and talk
to my people hereafter

368
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,120
I take full responsibility

369
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,600
Repay your loan
We won't disturb you

370
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,120
'A few days later...'

371
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:44,560
Grandma, a girl has come to see you

372
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,200
- Who are you?
- I want to meet Kamala Kannan bro

373
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,080
Why, dear?

374
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,480
I've passed 12th grade
I've got a seat in a medical college

375
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,840
I must get his signature
regarding my education loan

376
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,000
Can I meet him?

377
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,840
Who told you he signs for all this?

378
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,440
Bharathi madam in
Madurai Grama Bank told me

379
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,680
- Is anna here?
- Who is she?

380
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,840
A new Bharathi 'madam'?

381
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,200
She's the fair swan in Madurai bank

382
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,480
Our enemy
Ignore her

383
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,040
- What is your name?
- Venmani, bro

384
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,360
How much did you score?

385
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,280
-1189
- Very good

386
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,040
What do your parents do?

387
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,200
My father drives a bullock cart
My mother works in the field

388
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,240
You've got a seat
in Madurai medical college?

389
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,160
Yes, bro, to pay
my semester fees...

390
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,720
...I had gone to avail a loan
in Madurai Grama bank

391
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,600
Bharathi madam told me
I can get if you sign

392
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,320
Bharathi madam, huh?

393
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,200
NEET exam is very tough
How did you prepare for it?

394
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,000
Aiyo! That's a big torture, bro

395
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,760
Even 3-4 students who excel
failed in this exam, bro

396
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,600
My father sold his land
and sent me for tuition class

397
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,360
I worked heart and soul
and I passed the exam

398
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,680
How can we study Central board questions
not taught in our state board syllabus?

399
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,080
How do we answer such questions?

400
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,520
Aren't students who passed out
before us regarded as doctors, bro?

401
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,920
My dear girl
don't get me wrong

402
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,400
Your awareness of politics is super

403
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,760
If you studied law
instead of medicine

404
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,120
...you have a bright future

405
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,000
No, bro
This is my ambition

406
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,400
What did you study, bro?

407
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,600
Just like you, I went in
for a professional course

408
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,120
Our country doesn't offer a job
nor show respect for my subject

409
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,840
I took a degree in agriculture
in Madurai Agricultural college

410
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:50,600
So you've passed
2 exams simultaneously

411
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,160
You must be exhausted

412
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,360
What to do, bro

413
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,040
1st they grabbed money from us
by way of college admissions

414
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,520
Now tuition class became a big scam

415
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,240
True that

416
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,720
With such a vast syllabus
and varied subjects...

417
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,760
...to force students to attempt all this
at the same time is just not fair at all

418
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,480
Those who need to know
should get enlightened!

419
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,200
Hey! What's NEET?

420
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,200
Waking me up and
asking me irrelevant questions

421
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,400
All that is academic related
Just go back to sleep

422
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,960
So even you don't know?

423
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,800
They didn't teach us
all that in 8th grade

424
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,640
It has been added only now

425
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,320
I'm quite surprised
by Kamala Kannan

426
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,800
Only yesterday
I saw his Facebook profile

427
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,120
He doesn't have a single girl
in his Friends list

428
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,360
He cleared all the bank loans
day before yesterday, ma'am

429
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,000
Sounds good

430
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,440
Come along

431
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,480
Hello, Kannan sir

432
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,320
Madam told me
Give me your file

433
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,480
Vetri sir, what is the %
you charge for educational loans?

434
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,080
10-12%

435
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,880
Sir, what do you mean?

436
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,640
I pay only 8% for my car loan

437
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,400
What to do, sir?
We must abide by our bank rules

438
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,000
Give me your pen

439
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,760
My dear girl
Congratulations

440
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,360
You're availing a loan
from our Govt to study

441
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,160
Then don't go abroad
to serve the people

442
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,040
No, bro
I won't do that

443
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,240
Let's see

444
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,680
Please process it
at the earliest

445
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,960
We'll do our best, sir

446
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,880
Kamala Kannan sir

447
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,600
Don't hold it against us for meeting
the people who availed a loan

448
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,120
My situation was such-

449
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,080
Yes, sir, you'll torture a farmer
who borrowed just 5000

450
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,080
He will end his life, but one who
borrows millions will go scotfree

451
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,200
Your bank rules are 'splendid' indeed

452
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,880
Don't mistake us, sir

453
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,120
Venmani

454
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,720
Hello, Kannan sir
Take a seat

455
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,040
All the best
Study well

456
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,720
Thanks a lot, madam

457
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,880
Say thanks to him

458
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,800
Thanks, bro
I'll take leave

459
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,280
I hope you aren't angry with me

460
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,640
Not angry
A wee bit disappointed

461
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,840
I signed surety for that girl
just as you suggested

462
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,840
Clad in a 'kurta'

463
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,720

465
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,360

I'm doing what I know

468
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:17,240
Everyone publicizes
the good deeds they do

469
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,800
You're doing a lot of good

470
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,920
All my best wishes to you, sir

471
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,080
Why be so formal?
Feel free to call me Kannan

People above 60 don't qualify

497
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,800
Only pension is available
Ask them to collect that cash

Why can't a person
above 60 qualify for a job?

chief minister are all 60+, right?

00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,280
Come

523
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,640
"Girl, except for your name so sweet
all other languages take a backseat"

524
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,120
Saw that?
He went right on top

525
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,680
Can't catch him

526
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:38,720
"Words will let me down altogether"

527
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:50,000
'Pearl millet porridge
and buttermilk ready'

528
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,600
Oh my God!

529
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,560
Ezhumalai...!

530
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,400
Where are you going?
Stop, man

531
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,560
- Ezhumalai
- Uncle, open the door

532
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:18,040
- Unlock the door
- Ezhumalai

533
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,240
I won't harm you
Unbolt the door

534
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,600
'Open the door'

535
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,080
'Unlatch the door'

536
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,280
Let go of this

537
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,240
Ezhumalai, why did you take
such a rash decision?

538
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,440
Do you have any sense?

539
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,880
If you die, that news
won't even be reported!

540
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,120
Who will take care of your daughter?

541
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,720
We borrow money for farming

542
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,680
The fertilizer seller
takes half the amount

543
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,120
Moneylender grabs
the remaining amount, sir

544
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,120
Look at this bulb hanging here

545
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,680
The manufacturer
decides on its price

546
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,640
But the crops we produce
with our blood, sweat and tears

547
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,080
...we are unable to fix a price

548
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,800
Even the consumer doesn't get it

549
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,600
Even we farmers don't benefit

550
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,600
It lines the pockets
of the middle men alone

551
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:09,360
As a protest in Delhi we ran without
a stitch on us, we even ate rat curry

552
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,880
Did anyone in this country ask why?

553
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,880
Everyone just watched us
with amusement or curiosity

554
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,400
How can we survive
under such conditions?

555
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:21,560
Aiyo! I don't have the money
Otherwise I'll definitely pay, sir

556
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,640
Sir, we didn't come here
asking for money

557
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,400
Please pay when you can

558
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,920
Thank you very much, madam

559
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,240
Uncle, times will change

560
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,720
It won't continue the same way

561
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,400
If you don't work,
people in the cities will starve

562
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,840
Trust me
You are like God

563
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,320
Whatever hardship
please don't resort to this

564
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,960
- Hello...?
- Bharathi, this is Kannan here

565
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,920
- Kamala Kannan
- Tell me, Kamala Kannan

566
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,520
There's an alumni meet
in my college tomorrow morning

567
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,960
I'm attending it

568
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,200
If you are free
can you come with me?

569
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,200
Actually I'm free, we can go

570
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,040
Oh! But one thing

571
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,720
Can we take your car?

572
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,720
I don't use this car
for personal work

573
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,240
Which means Bharathi is equal to integrity

574
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,960
Is that right?

575
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,800
Yes, you can say so

576
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:42,360
'I call upon our special guest
poet Aathmarthi to share a few words'

577
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,640
Dear guests

578
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,040
My words are just poetry

579
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,760
But your grain is food for the poor

580
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,160
Agricultural scientists

581
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:55,360
Like how a sheaf of grain bends
its head to the ground, I salute you

582
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,320
2 souls unite, love blossoms
Even in contradictions friendship blooms

583
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,600
I wrote this

584
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,480
I see it truly in your expressions

585
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,960
Thank you

586
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,760
Sir...?

587
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,160
Bharathi, my professor
I'll be back

588
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,160
Hello

589
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,200
I'm Anban
Kannan's friend

590
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,560
Is that so?
Please sit

591
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,760
Thank you

592
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,760
I live in New Jersey

593
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,280
In our whole batch
Kannan was really one of a kind

594
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,080
Congrats...!

595
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,640
Kannan and you are
made for each other

596
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,920
When is the wedding?

597
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,200
Who is marrying whom?

598
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,320
Kannan and you?

599
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,280
Did he say that?

600
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,200
I've told most of our friends here

601
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,080
Remember to invite me
for the wedding

602
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,720
He must be settling abroad

603
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,480
Dressed in a kurta,
obsessing about organic farming

604
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,520
...he's wasting his talent here

605
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,880
His simplicity and
the way he loves this town

606
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,000
His helping tendency

607
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,880
I like all that about him

608
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,840
I'll make sure he doesn't
change in his ways

609
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,520
- Is this assurance enough?
- Okay...good

610
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,120
Thank you, sir
See you

611
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,320
Hey! What's up?

612
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,520
The jar and lid
make a perfect fit

613
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,680
Your 'Mrs'!
Don't let go

614
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,720
All the best!

615
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,880
Mrs...?

616
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:26,240
If you are free tomorrow, can you come
with me to Mettu Neerathan temple?

617
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,840
Do I have to?

618
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,040
I need to talk to you

619
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,600
Hmm...okay

620
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,440
Bharathi, sorry
I got a bit delayed

621
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,720
It's okay

622
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,760
Tell me

623
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,640
You could have told me
I would have felt good

624
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,760
Deals with situations bravely

625
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,960
But scared to profess his feelings
to the girl he loves

626
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,280
That's a typical male trait

627
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,680
Can't be changed

628
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,920
I should have told you myself

629
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,560
Anban messed it up

630
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,840
Don't know what to say now

631
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,920
I'm kind of feeling jammed

632
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,960
To go against the wishes of my family

633
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,840
And to get married immediately

634
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,720
...I'm not a young girl!

635
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,240
My job

636
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,120
Your value in society

637
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,320
Then...

638
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,440
...both the families

639
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:02,880
...without any fights or bad vibes
should consent to this marriage

640
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,800
It's very important to me

641
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,000
Please discuss with your family

642
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,760
If they consent...

643
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,360
...we can talk about it

644
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,360
Otherwise it's fine

645
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,960
This is reality

646
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,840
If they don't accept...

647
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,800
...let's stay as friends always

648
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:28,960
Okay...?

649
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,440
Okay

650
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,000
Let's stay as friends

651
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,360
Your sari looks good

652
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:45,200
I bought it in the Govt
handloom store Co-optex

653
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,040
Oh Co-optex?

654
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,240
That means...

655
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,600
...you're also like me
Particular about going green?

656
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,120
Not that

657
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,120
I belong to the weavers' caste

658
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:02,400
To weave a sari, a weaver has to move
his arms and legs 20000 times!

659
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,720
I'm wearing this sari for them

660
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,480
Don't forget about our topic

661
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,520
Kanna, please stop

662
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,560
- I need to talk to you
- What, appa?

663
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:30,880
I heard about Bharathi
That Madurai bank officer

664
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,880
Her family and relatives

665
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,080
We don't know their customs and habits

666
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,440
They won't understand our lifestyle

667
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,720
We belong to a family of agriculturists

668
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,160
I don't know what to say

669
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:47,760
If no one in our family circle approves
then what do we do?

670
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,160
Father, just like that
how can I say 'no' to her?

671
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,640
I didn't tell you to forget that girl

672
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,200
Hey, Ramasamy

673
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,680
What are you saying?

674
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,080
What does he know about
deceit or dishonesty?

675
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:05,120
He doesn't even know to differentiate
a burnt 'paniyaram' from a good one

676
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,400
Discussing all this
with such a naive boy

677
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,760
Her complexion, the way she talks
or her home and surroundings

678
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:13,480
Who knows what he saw
and flipped for her

679
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,440
My dear grandson
You were just 5 years old

680
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:21,000
Your mother handed you
over to me and died

681
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,640
From then, only we have
been taking care of you

682
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:27,440
We know to decide
what is good and bad for you

683
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,680
Take me to that girl's house

684
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,200
Let's see if it will work out

685
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:35,400
Or if we can iron the creases if any

686
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,960
Otherwise...

687
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,800
...what I decide is final!

688
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:42,160
Ramasamy, do you agree with me?

689
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,120
You must obey
whatever I decide

690
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,880
Father, what is this?

691
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,120
When have I not listened to you both?

692
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:54,040
I'll go by what you say
I can assure you

693
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,040
Do you understand?

694
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:04,400
On behalf of Madurai Grama Bank...

695
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:09,160
...we are proud to give this award
to our best customer, Mr Kamala Kannan

696
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,680
The loans he got for others...

697
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:17,640
...without expecting anything in return,
he repaid the bank on their behalf

698
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,040
He studied in Agricultural college

699
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,280
And is employed as a farmer
in his own town

700
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,560
A person of great values

701
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,440
I can go on and on

702
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,360
- Congratulations
- Thank you, sir

703
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,040
Congratulations!

704
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,240
Bharathi, you invited me for the function
and praised me sky high

705
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,880
I was quite embarrassed

706
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,720
Power outage

707
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,640
Bharathi!

708
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,120
What happened to you?

709
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,840
Bharathi, relax

710
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:03,480
Hello, someone please help

711
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,160
Hello, there's a power cut

712
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,880
Don't be scared, Bharathi

713
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,480
Power will be restored soon

714
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,200
Someone please help

715
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,760
Bharathi, it will be fine

716
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:17,960
Wait, it's coming up

717
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,360
Bharathi, are you okay?

718
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,960
What's happening here?

719
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,400
I'm sorry...sorry

720
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:38,080
Hey, Kanna I thought you'll slap her
You stuck to her like a flat bread!

721
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,240
Dai, show some respect

722
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,040
She's your sister-in-law

723
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,640
His fiancee, huh?

724
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:45,920
What did he say just now?

725
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,760
Isn't it shocking?

726
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,800
Bharathi...?

727
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,480
You are usually so brave

728
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,600
Why were you so terrified?

729
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,000
What happened?

730
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,480
When I was young
I had a tragic experience

731
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,960
From then on I'm petrified of darkness

732
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:04,480
I'll tell you later
At a more appropriate time

733
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,440
- Hello...?
- Bharathi

734
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,720
My grandmother and I
are coming to your house

735
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,080
- Coming now?
- Yes

736
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,200
- Please come
- Okay

737
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:42,560
Didn't you inform her earlier?

738
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,240
I did, grandma
But told her to be ready now

739
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,640
Is that girl at home?

740
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,440
Today is Sunday

741
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,760
Bank is closed

742
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,200
Yes, Sunday

743
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,640
Govt banks are closed

744
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,760
- Hello, Kannan
- Bharathi, this is my grandma

745
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:12,280
Namaste, grandma

746
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,680
I am so happy you've visited us

747
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,720
Please sit

748
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:34,880
This is my brother Naresh

749
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:38,320
He studied Mechanical Engineering
and is working in TVS now

750
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,280
I'm Kamala Kannan

751
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:40,960
My sister has told me about you

752
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,560
Bring tea

753
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,840
Did you have a surgery for your eyes?

754
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,120
Not a surgery

755
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,520
When Bharathi was 5 years old...

756
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,440
...I lost my eyesight

757
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,280
Can't you see at all?

758
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,960
House is very spacious, eh?

759
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,120
Do you have a terrace?

760
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,000
Hey, take a look around

761
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,680
Give him a tour of your house, dear

762
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:08,040
This is a rented house, right?

763
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,400
Very spacious

764
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,040
Terrace is this way

765
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,280
Grandma, have tea

766
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,000
I added sugar
Is it okay?

767
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:34,880
Do you eat meat and fish?

768
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:36,080
Yes, we eat meat

769
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:38,760
Where did your daughter work
prior to this bank job?

770
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:39,840
In Pondicherry

771
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,800
Then why did you move here?

772
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,360
My daughter is very honest

773
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,760
Straightforward

774
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,600
Very strict, huh?

775
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,640
If she's too strict
she can't work everywhere

776
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,000
What to do?

777
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:52,960
This is a quality
she's born with!

778
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,640
Fair is fair, wrong is wrong
irrespective of who does it

779
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,680
Will she be permanent in this job?

780
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:58,960
Can't be too sure

781
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,760
She can be transferred
whenever and wherever

782
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,800
Only after meeting
your mother, I realize now

783
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:07,720
Why you were so terrified
during the power outage in the lift

784
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,040
I'm terrified of darkness

785
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,560
My mother isn't conscious
about light at all

786
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,000
When I was young...

787
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:21,680
...she used to leave me alone
in darkness and go

788
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,080
So from right then
I have a phobia for darkness

789
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,360
Sorry

790
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,520
That's okay

791
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,520
Tell me what your grandma
will be asking my mother now?

792
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,680
My grandma is enquiring
about you downstairs

793
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,880
You are questioning me
here on the terrace

794
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
You can come up with the answer too

795
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,640
She'll be asking
about our caste

796
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,200
How did you guess so right?

797
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,280
Don't we know about elders?

798
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:50,880
Let her ask
I don't mind

799
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,960
Will that be a restriction?

800
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:26,600
Kanna

801
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,880
I'm feeling tired

802
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,720
I'll go rest for a while

803
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:32,200
You go and lie down for a while too

804
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:54,800
Bro, what did grandma say?

805
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,080
For whatever reason on earth
don't ever resign your job

806
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:11,240
You won't get this meat
and salary anywhere else

807
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,040
I intended to endorse the same

808
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,520
Given that you don't work
you can't get a better deal

809
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:18,120
Why are you standing out?
Come in and eat

810
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,200
Sathish, serve them also

811
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,440
Ma, I have brought sarees

812
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:25,160
Aunt will inspect the saree inside out

813
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,400
She won't comment
if she liked it or not

814
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,720
She isn't decisive by nature

815
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:36,320
- Aunt, some meat for me
- Bite your finger instead!

816
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:38,320
Ma, I have brought Madras sarees

817
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:41,560
- Look how she's taking it out on us
- I'm busy, come tomorrow

818
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:42,840
Okay

819
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:45,600
Hey! Thanks for the hint

820
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,680
The decision has been made

821
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:51,800
I've told the concerned person
I don't have to tell you

822
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,640
Focus on your work
instead of being judgmental

823
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,240
Wash your hands

824
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,080
I thought you will ask me

825
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,920
But it is my duty to tell you

826
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:19,120
Your grandmother said we should
postpone discussions on this alliance

827
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:25,480
She is saying we can decide
after we completely understand the girl

828
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:30,160
Until then, try to avoid
spending time with her

829
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:36,960
Also stop sending messages
and talking over the phone

830
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:41,160
Nowadays girls go to the police station
at the slightest disagreement

831
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,920
And tarnish the family name

832
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:46,840
Be careful, son

833
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,000
- Okay, pa
- Good

834
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:31,760
"Apple of my eye; my vision is lost"

835
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,800
"Lost favor in her eyes; star-crossed?"

836
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,560
Kanna, come and eat

837
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:36,920
Not hungry, grandma

838
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
"Apple of my eye; my vision is missing"

839
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,960
How can you not be hungry?

840
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,920
Shouldn't you eat on time?

841
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,200
"Will I meet her, my cherished blessing?"

842
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:52,560
"She stood before me; my fair missy
Why did she enter my heart in a jiffy?"

843
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:58,480
"She waltzed into my heart's alcove
and locked herself in, my true love"

844
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:05,240
"How can I forget this sensation?
To die is a much better option"

845
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,120
Phone is ringing
He's ignoring it

846
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,320
Kanna

847
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,160
Your phone is ringing

848
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:47,960
"If love is considered a cuss word to scorn
why are these trouble makers born?"

849
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,280
- Tea?
- I don't want

850
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:51,040
- Starving since morning
- I don't want

851
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:54,720
"If the criteria is caste
for love to bloom and last"

852
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:59,640
"Do birds and beasts find their catch
with horoscopes drawn to match?"

853
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,000
Hello...who is it?

854
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:08,160
"If marriage is love's enemy
do we need a holy matrimony?"

855
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:09,440
Hello

856
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:14,480
"This deep chasm separating you and me"

857
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:18,040
"Shall I kiss goodbye; cover for eternity?"

858
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:22,480
"Apple of my eye; my vision is lost"

859
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:36,080
"Apple of my eye; my vision is missing"

860
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:41,400
"Lost favor in her eyes; star-crossed?"

861
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:45,120
"Apple of my eye; my vision is missing"

862
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:50,640
"Will I meet her, my cherished blessing?"

863
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:56,920
"She stood before me; my fair missy
Why did she enter my heart in a jiffy?"

864
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:02,920
"She whizzed into my heart's alcove
and locked herself in, my true love"

865
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:09,400
"How can I forget this lovely creation?
To die is a much better option"

866
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:17,120
Caw...caw...caw!

867
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,160
Hello

868
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,400
Kamala Kannan?

869
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,240
This is Bharathi

870
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:43,200
In my entire life

871
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:45,880
I've never had a wish list

872
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,320
I was never impulsive either

873
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:55,280
But I think in your case
I made an impulsive decision

874
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,680
God bless you

875
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,520
Thanks

876
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:40,000
Madam, this isn't yours

877
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:41,920
Your bike is over there

878
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:47,760
Did you check his BP?

879
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:50,080
- He isn't letting me check
- Why?

880
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,160
Kamala Kannan sir
You are educated

881
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:53,720
Don't make us compel you

882
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:55,800
What kind of care are you giving?

883
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:57,360
He hasn't eaten
for more than a week

884
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:00,520
Not being cooperative either
What do you want me to do?

885
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:06,920
Find out what's troubling him
and give him some juice at least

886
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,680
- Let me know after he eats
- Okay, doctor

887
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,840
I didn't expect this

888
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:18,360
People won't say Ramasamy's son
Kamala Kannan died of hunger

889
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:21,080
They will gossip
it was suicide

890
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:24,240
Did I make you study agriculture
to earn this name?

891
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,520
We aren't against your love

892
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:30,920
Shouldn't we worry
if this girl is right for you?

893
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,920
You set a fine example
for everything

894
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:35,640
Can you resort to this now?

895
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,040
1st please eat

896
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:51,800
'Emergency Treatment Unit'

897
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,760
- There she is
- Madam, wait

898
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:14,240
Where are you going?

899
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:15,520
Hey, stop

900
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:18,240
- Madam, they just barged in
- I'll handle it

901
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:19,920
Okay, get back to work

902
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,600
- Please sit down
- He didn't eat for a week

903
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:24,240
None of us knew

904
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:26,400
He fainted in the field suddenly

905
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:28,240
We admitted him in the hospital

906
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:29,640
Even now he refuses to eat

907
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:32,640
- I don't know what to do
- Let me come with you

908
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:22,640
Mother

909
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:24,920
Come out

910
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:26,720
All of you come out

911
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:35,720
Hey...don't get up
Lie down

912
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:43,320
Why, Kannan?

913
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:45,240
Why did you do this?

914
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:46,680
Bharathi

915
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:49,160
I don't have a mother

916
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,960
My grandmother is like my mother

917
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:55,400
I've never disobeyed my father

918
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:58,720
I didn't know
how to convince them

919
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,520
And take you home as my wife

920
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:05,520
I had no other option

921
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:24,840
- Can I give?
- Go ahead

922
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:29,720
Drink this

923
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:46,040
Brother has broken his fast!

924
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:48,720
Bro finally drank a glass of juice!

925
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:57,480
Shut up!

926
01:04:58,040 --> 01:04:59,400
I'll strangle you

927
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:46,320
Greetings, madam

928
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:47,800
- How are you all?
- We are fine

929
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:48,960
Please sit

930
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:50,440
Look at the reception for her

931
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:52,400
All bank loan cases!

932
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:59,320
Come...take flowers

933
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:01,040
Sit down

934
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:10,560
Grandma, who is that fatso
with a smile stuck on his face?

935
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:12,040
Brother

936
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:14,320
That girl's only brother

937
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:19,640
Kannan sir isn't even looking our way

938
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:22,200
Sir is blinded by love

939
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:25,200
Bride shouldn't sit along with
the groom, get up and sit down

940
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,440
I'm not used to
sitting on the floor

941
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:29,600
- Shall I sit?
- No need

942
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:31,880
Not necessary
Let her sit here

943
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:33,160
'So what?'

944
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,200
It's alright
Sit there and talk

945
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:39,040
Take this flower, mother

946
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,560
I have no one to talk on my behalf

947
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:47,760
Sorry, don't misunderstand

948
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:49,480
It's alright
Go ahead

949
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:54,120
I have saved a small sum
for my wedding

950
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:56,600
That is all I can bring with me

951
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:59,320
Be it cash or jewelry

952
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:02,120
We can share
the marriage expenses 50-50

953
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:05,880
Who will tie the wedding knot?
Bride or groom?!

954
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:07,400
- God knows!
- Grandma!

955
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:11,320
Can't say a word about her
He'll pounce in a coconut shell of water!

956
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:14,000
We don't want anything
Only 1 prerequisite

957
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:16,520
That's also my mother's wish

958
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:20,480
She wants to know if you must
work even after the wedding?

959
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:24,800
I got this job
with great difficulty

960
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:28,320
Can I take some time
to think and let you know?

961
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:32,240
Grandma, it isn't wrong
to work after marriage

962
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:34,160
Even you went to work in the fields

963
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,800
- Did anyone object?
- When did I go to work?

964
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:40,480
All the women will come to
my field to work at dawn

965
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:44,040
Can we fix the wedding date
for the 18th of this month?

966
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:47,280
It isn't a bank holiday

967
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:49,200
I'll look at the list
of holidays for the bank

968
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:51,640
Fix an auspicious date
and tell you tomorrow

969
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:53,160
Fine!

970
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:55,120
Alright

971
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:00,960
Bharathi

972
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:03,680
Take mother back home safe and sound

973
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:10,200
Won't she know
to take care of her mother?

974
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:12,760
Why go overboard?

975
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:19,520
"Garlands exchanged on an auspicious day"

976
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:24,720
"In the most perfumed way
Adorns the bride's shoulder today"

977
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:29,840
"May you both be blessed
In love and laughter immersed"

978
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:35,240
"May fortune shower for eternity
with prosperity and plenty"

979
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:37,480
[song from 'December Pookkal']

980
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:38,920
Muthu!

981
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,400
Will you follow me
like a lost pup, dear?

982
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:43,120
Go and be seated

983
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:45,840
- Bride's room, huh?
- Go and sit

984
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:47,360
'We are not allowed'

985
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:49,960
- See if you have to pin this
- Greetings

986
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:52,360
I am Muthulakshmi
Kannan's class mate

987
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:53,960
Is that so?
Which grade

988
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,240
We studied together
till 8th grade

989
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:57,640
Then?

990
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:59,640
Kannan continued and I didn't

991
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:02,600
My father wanted me to look after
our coconut business

992
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:03,480
Okay!

993
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:04,760
You look beautiful

994
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:06,440
You are decked with all the jewelry

995
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:08,120
No bridal make up, huh?

996
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:13,800
Why do you want me to stand on
the stage looking ashen like a ghost?

997
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:17,040
When guests who attended
our wedding meet me later on

998
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:20,160
...I have to keep reminding them
I am the same bride

999
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:22,720
- Do we need that?
- So true

1000
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:26,560
As it is you are so fair
Why do you even need make up?

1001
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:29,640
Boodham sir, is the banquet
vegetarian or non vegetarian?

1002
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:31,800
What is the event here?
What are you harping on?

1003
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:34,160
- Keep quiet
- Just a matter of curiosity

1004
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:36,520
Then go to the kitchen
and find out

1005
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,400
So you don't intend eating?

1006
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:42,720
"Love will continue forever
with no stumbling blocks to sever"

1007
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:45,080
Bride doesn't look like
she's from this area

1008
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:46,240
How did you agree?

1009
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:48,640
- Hey Arumugam, keep quiet
- Okay

1010
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:51,800
- Mother
- Bharathi

1011
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:53,240
Come forward

1012
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,840
Grandma, such a fair beauty
same complexion as our MGR

1013
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:59,120
Did you ever think your family will get?

1014
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:00,560
Look at her properly

1015
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:01,880
True

1016
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:04,920
May virtue, principles of life
and love be granted in plenty

1017
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:06,680
To be blessed with whatever is desired

1018
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:08,800
To attain the pinnacle
of fame successfully

1019
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,280
With God as sublime guide

1020
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:12,280
Conform to the code
of the classic Thirukkural

1021
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:13,320
With praise from world over

1022
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:16,880
May Kamala Kannan and Bharathi
lead a long life as husband and wife

1023
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:46,880
What are you doing here?
Not coming in to eat?

1024
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:48,520
If appa finds out
you'll be dead meat!

1025
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:52,120
Common knowledge on a wedding eve
friends chill out and drink

1026
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:53,920
Fathers world over know this

1027
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:54,840
Care to join us?

1028
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:57,360
Are you drinking
because I'm married?

1029
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:59,280
Or because you are still bachelors?

1030
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:01,240
Kanna, come up
You are wanted here

1031
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:04,480
I'm coming
Drink less and eat fast

1032
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:07,320
Kanna, best wishes
for your first night

1033
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:10,360
What do you mean by 'first' night?
Hasn't he seen a night before?

1034
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:14,840
Partner, in every marriage
a girl gets a husband

1035
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:18,040
But a friend loses his friend

1036
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:20,080
Understood?

1037
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:21,680
Tanked, huh?

1038
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:12,360
Grandma, I'm leaving for work

1039
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:14,040
I'm off to work

1040
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:32,600
Old people look forward to
their daughter-in-law

1041
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,440
...taking over the household chores

1042
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:37,000
The tables are turned here

1043
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:40,000
Like Indira Gandhi, prim and proper,
with a purposeful stride

1044
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:42,600
'Then who is to do
all the household chores?'

1045
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:43,920
'Who will cook?'

1046
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,160
Who will wash the clothes?

1047
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:47,920
Am I her servant maid
to do all this?

1048
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:51,040
'At daybreak women usually
come to my house to work'

1049
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:53,960
'A woman from my household
shouldn't go out to work'

1050
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:00,480
Ganesha

1051
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:01,680
'Yes, bro'

1052
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:03,120
Is the farm house empty?

1053
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:05,600
'Yes, bro, whitewashed
I have it spic and span'

1054
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:08,200
I'll explain later
Come there with the keys

1055
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:20,120
- Yes, uncle
- Don't unload

1056
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:21,520
Wait for a while

1057
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:23,760
We may have to go
somewhere else

1058
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:24,760
Okay!

1059
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:28,640
Hey, what's happening here?

1060
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:31,400
I want her to stop working
and stay put at home

1061
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:33,680
You want them to go
and live separately

1062
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:36,160
What does he know?
You madcap!

1063
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:39,000
I am keeping quiet
because you are my mother

1064
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,920
1st you were his grandmother

1065
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,720
Then you became his mother

1066
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:44,600
Now mother-in-law, huh?

1067
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:45,920
Go inside!

1068
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:05,000
Amma...!

1069
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:09,480
Mother!

1070
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:20,240
I am leaving half my life behind

1071
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:28,400
Please take good care of my son

1072
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:43,480
As far as I know instead of living
in a joint family after being married

1073
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:46,280
...you are the 1st man
to go live independently

1074
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:49,480
Usually sons argue with their father

1075
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:51,080
Then raise their fists

1076
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:54,640
But like a rooster under a spell,
you agree to whatever your father says

1077
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:56,120
That's how I am

1078
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:10,840
Naresh, why are you doing all this?

1079
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,160
Take it from him

1080
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:13,400
You come in

1081
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:16,680
- Sorry
- Please go, Your Highness

1082
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:19,720
- Saw that?
- No, I didn't

1083
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:22,960
You should have been
his brother-in-law, go in

1084
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:26,120
Hey Karuppu
Let me carry an item

1085
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:32,960
No one is scared of me
being their manager!

1086
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:49,880
Karuppa'nna

1087
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,320
- How are you?
- I am fine

1088
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:53,680
Kannan is sitting
in the grove outside

1089
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:01,320
What is this?

1090
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:04,600
Before I could return from office,
you've shifted house

1091
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:07,240
Uncle called and told me

1092
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,160
Didn't specify any reason

1093
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:12,320
Shall I make some coffee?

1094
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:14,000
I bought milk on the way

1095
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,040
And...sorry

1096
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:21,720
Went off to sleep last night

1097
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:26,880
Most probably I must be the only girl
to have slept on her wedding night

1098
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:30,920
Singlehanded I took up
all the wedding preparations

1099
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,480
I was so exhausted

1100
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:35,960
Looks like you want to
say something?

1101
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:37,480
Nothing

1102
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:41,240
It's okay
Speak your mind out

1103
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:45,560
Shall we bathe together?

1104
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:06,000
"Chrysanthemum of mine
Island of orange skies sublime"

1105
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:10,440
"You came before me
like golden honey"

1106
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:14,520
"You ignited my dormant masculinity"

1107
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:19,800
"My husband, my true-blue
Brave heart from Tamil Nadu"

1108
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:24,120
"You came like a vision in front of me"

1109
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:28,960
"You fuelled my femininity"

1110
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:44,360
Bharathi

1111
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:46,520
Bharathi

1112
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:49,520
It's early morning

1113
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:51,200
The sun has risen

1114
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:53,440
Why has this 'moon' not yet gone?

1115
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:56,440
- Not going to work today
- Why?

1116
01:17:57,640 --> 01:17:59,120
That's how it is

1117
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:14,320
"Hey! Beautiful banker
Lend me a kiss tender"

1118
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:19,800
"I'll offer it with interest
more than the capital you invest"

1119
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:24,480
"If you give yourself as security
and 'will' your life to me"

1120
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:29,120
"As interest with delight
I'll lend myself to you tonight"

1121
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:33,240
"Let your wedding sari crease in our ardor"

1122
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:37,360
"Let it crush some more, my ardent lover"

1123
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:39,680
"Don't postpone it now"

1124
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:42,920
"Don't lock me out, love"

1125
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:11,080
It's a week
Not a single call

1126
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:13,400
- Yes
- How's Kannan?

1127
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:15,160
How do I tell you
the disgusting facts!

1128
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:17,720
- What's so disgusting?
- Come and see for yourself

1129
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:18,880
What are you saying?

1130
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:23,480
"I'll make you my baby
Bother you a little maybe"

1131
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:28,920
"Love, with love as our radius
we'll make out a circle of bliss"

1132
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:33,480
"I'll do household chores for you, love
I'll weed out the garden and grove"

1133
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:36,920
"I'll choose the right time to woo you
into precious motherhood anew"

1134
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:40,480
Hey Kanna, you've changed
so much after marriage?

1135
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:43,960
Doesn't your husband help you?

1136
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
This specimen?
Have you even lifted 1 tumbler?

1137
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:47,720
From tomorrow I'll do
all the chores, dear

1138
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:48,520
I've doing everything

1139
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:50,440
Kanna, punishment for visiting you, eh?

1140
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:52,160
You've trained him well

1141
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:56,600
"Chrysanthemum of mine
Island of crimson skies divine"

1142
01:19:56,680 --> 01:20:00,960
"You came before me
like golden honey"

1143
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:04,880
"You ignited my dormant masculinity"

1144
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:10,280
"My husband, my true-blue
Brave heart of Tamil Nadu"

1145
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:14,800
"You came like a vision in front of me"

1146
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:19,440
"You fanned my femininity"

1147
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:31,160
- Do you work here?
- Er...no

1148
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:32,520
Why were you staring at me?

1149
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:34,080
- I wasn't staring
- Want me to complain?

1150
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:35,760
What happened?

1151
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:38,000
He was looking at me in a weird way

1152
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:40,240
Bharathi means anger

1153
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:42,480
Otherwise Bharathi = courage

1154
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:43,840
Right?

1155
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:46,080
- Right?
- Very good

1156
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:50,200
Watch your step

1157
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:51,760
Don't trip and fall down

1158
01:20:57,680 --> 01:20:59,960
Wait here for a minute
I'll be back

1159
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:08,800
This is binoculars, you can see
distant objects at close range

1160
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:11,040
- Want to see?
- You think I'm a blind old lady?

1161
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:12,240
Get lost

1162
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:17,240
He's fastening a clothes peg
on to her petticoat

1163
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:18,600
Good lord!

1164
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:21,240
He'll fasten her blouse next

1165
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:36,120
Grandma, look there

1166
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:38,560
He's making sure
the batter is really sour

1167
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:42,280
I never imagined
bro will change like this

1168
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:45,440
He has become a slave
to her rosy complexion

1169
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:05,800
Uncle, why are you sitting here?

1170
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:07,440
- Please come in
- It's okay

1171
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:09,840
No, please come in
Give this to me

1172
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:17,080
Please sit down

1173
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:26,640
Make an entry and
hand it over to the cashier

1174
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:27,920
Okay, madam

1175
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:33,200
Uncle, my husband told me
you wanted us to live independently

1176
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:35,760
We came out too

1177
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:37,720
We accepted your suggestion

1178
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,560
After that you didn't even visit us

1179
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:42,640
What mistake did I commit, uncle?

1180
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:45,000
Whatever I do
will always be right, dear

1181
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:48,120
Your grandma and others
haven't understood you well enough

1182
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:51,360
Your education and job
come across as temerity to them

1183
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,440
At this juncture
if we are a joint family...

1184
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,200
...their hints and digs at you

1185
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:58,600
Their ignorance will only hurt you

1186
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:01,440
The 1st year of marriage...

1187
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:03,880
...should be happy memories
to recollect later on

1188
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:07,000
I didn't want you to lose that pleasure

1189
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:08,560
That's why I decided

1190
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:16,880
Uncle, I never understood
your thoughtfulness or farsightedness

1191
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:20,880
Please bless me with
a happy, healthy life

1192
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,000
It's okay, dear

1193
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:28,720
May you be happy
You'll always do well in life

1194
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:48,120
- Wait, I'll be back
- Okay, sir

1195
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:53,880
Tell me, Arumugam

1196
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:55,640
Do you know this news or not?

1197
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:56,680
What...?

1198
01:23:56,720 --> 01:23:58,200
Your son is here

1199
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:00,080
- When...?
- Just now

1200
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:01,480
Look at that!

1201
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:04,240
I called Kannan
but his phone is switched off

1202
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:07,520
His phone is charging here
and he has gone to the market

1203
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:08,560
Please sit, uncle

1204
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:11,800
He's helping with the chores
only after marrying you

1205
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:14,320
Only the 2 of us at home

1206
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:16,520
I leave at 7:00 a.m to the bank

1207
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:18,840
We decided we don't need a maid

1208
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:21,280
We split the work
among ourselves

1209
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:25,400
You can visit us on Sundays
along with Kannan, right?

1210
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:28,400
Where's the time, uncle?
You know how hectic my job is

1211
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:30,440
I work even on Sundays

1212
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:32,920
How is grandma doing?

1213
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:36,320
What does she lack in life?
She'll enquire about you now and then

1214
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:43,120
My dear, bring the lentil soup
you just served

1215
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:50,640
Pour some in my hand

1216
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:01,960
Pack some for me
I'll take it back home

1217
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:04,000
I'm hungry, dear

1218
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:05,480
Come inside

1219
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:10,360
What a surprise, pa

1220
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:13,400
If I knew you were coming,
I would've got meat

1221
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:15,760
It's okay
Come and eat with me

1222
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:20,720
To get a wife who can
cook a gourmet meal

1223
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,160
...is a special boon!

1224
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:23,680
Come and eat

1225
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:35,520
What...?

1226
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:38,080
'Is the whole family under her spell?'

1227
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:39,840
Cruel antics of time!

1228
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:43,040
Go and learn how to cook
a tasty gourmet meal

1229
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:45,200
...from my daughter-in-law

1230
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:49,120
All these years I've been fooled by you
about how 'rasam' really tastes!

1231
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:52,560
Hold it, this is how
lentil soup should taste

1232
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:56,440
Chithra

1233
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:58,760
Pour that disgusting stuff!

1234
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:00,200
Pour

1235
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:11,800
Big deal! She has garnished it
liberally with cumin seeds and pepper

1236
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:14,000
He has a tongue that's gone numb!

1237
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:16,480
Bring a plate of rice
Let's taste it

1238
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:23,680
'Days passed by'

1239
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:11,720
What is bothering you, Kannan?
You are here out of the blue?

1240
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:14,520
Bro, it's an urgent necessity

1241
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:16,320
I have no other option

1242
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:18,200
Hello, Kamala Kannan
Please sit

1243
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:20,400
- Making him wait outside?
- Getting his signature

1244
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:21,480
- Take him inside
- Sure

1245
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:23,000
Greetings, bro

1246
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:31,600
- Got your money?
- Yes

1247
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:33,040
- Pay it promptly
- Sure, bro

1248
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:35,240
- Don't make me hit you
- I'll repay, bro

1249
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:37,680
- Shall I take leave, Kannan?
- Sure, sir

1250
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:51,480
Bend low when borrowing

1251
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:53,560
Acting high and mighty
when I ask for repayment

1252
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:55,080
Don't do all that
Understood?

1253
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:56,120
Okay!

1254
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:15,440
Kanna, pick up the phone!

1255
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:17,400
When will you pick up the phone?

1256
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:23,760
Isn't that Kannan?

1257
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:27,240
Why is he talking to this fellow?

1258
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:31,120
Must be some lending and borrowing
between them, come inside

1259
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:34,840
You came home to borrow money
Don't you know to return?

1260
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,800
If you intended to return
you would've come home

1261
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:39,960
I never said
it isn't your money, no?

1262
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:42,280
Will you even say that?

1263
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:47,520
What is this, bro?

1264
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:49,840
Hitting me while I'm talking to you

1265
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:53,440
I thought you're educated
and you're trying to cheat royally?

1266
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,440
Muthu, did you see that?

1267
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:17,480
They are fighting

1268
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:42,840
Appa, Kamala Kannan anna

1269
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:44,760
He's the one who
helped us with the loan

1270
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:46,480
Come...come

1271
01:30:57,560 --> 01:30:59,920
[overlap of voices]

1272
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:05,040
Why are you hitting him?

1273
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:07,480
Who do you think you are?
How dare you hit him!

1274
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:09,800
Muthulakshmi, he'll come home
and borrow 3 lakhs

1275
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:12,400
He won't pay the interest
Won't pick up my calls either

1276
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:15,080
- You want me to pamper him?
- I'll repay you

1277
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:16,160
Isn't there a decorum?

1278
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:17,560
You can hit if you lend money?

1279
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:19,160
Shall I hit you then, man?

1280
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:20,960
If I hit you...

1281
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:23,040
...you'll be humiliated
till your last breath

1282
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:25,960
Kanna, why do you borrow money
from random men?

1283
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Don't let your tongue run
because he's your friend, beware!

1284
01:31:30,040 --> 01:31:31,160
'Harping about money'

1285
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:32,560
Bro, what happened?

1286
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:33,800
Isn't a man's life important?

1287
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:36,440
If anything happens to Kannan,
I'll murder you

1288
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:38,240
Get lost!
Scrawny fellow

1289
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:39,800
Hey, Alagar

1290
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,920
Come fast to our common grounds

1291
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:59,760
Hey, Nagendra
Come out

1292
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:01,360
With whose permission
did you lend money?

1293
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:04,520
Before lending, did you ask
the elders in the family?

1294
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:07,800
I have enough assets to last
for the next 4 or 5 generations

1295
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:09,640
Why should we borrow money from you?

1296
01:32:09,680 --> 01:32:12,800
Nagendra, why did you lose your temper?

1297
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:15,840
You hit my grandson who is always
as righteous as Lord Rama

1298
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:18,600
...who doesn't hurt anyone
He doesn't even stamp a worm

1299
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:20,160
You thought no one will defend him?

1300
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:23,600
She's from a respectable family
If she curses us, we won't prosper

1301
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:26,240
Dai, are you coming out
or should I come in?

1302
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:28,000
Nagendra, come out, da

1303
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:31,320
How dare you hit my-

1304
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:34,600
It was wrong on my part to hit him

1305
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:36,520
Forgive me

1306
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:42,360
I should have asked you
before lending the money

1307
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:43,960
Send the money

1308
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:47,600
Give him the money

1309
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:58,080
How could you?

1310
01:32:58,120 --> 01:33:00,560
Did you just watch
till he borrowed 300000?

1311
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:02,480
Why is he so short of money?

1312
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:05,840
If he had asked his father
he would've given, so would you

1313
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:08,040
Why does he need so much money?

1314
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:11,840
- She would've told him not to ask
- Who...?

1315
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:13,760
New addition into our family

1316
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:16,080
Walks erect like Indira Gandhi

1317
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:18,280
She married him
just as she wanted, right?

1318
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:21,000
Arrogance! She would have
told him not to ask

1319
01:33:21,080 --> 01:33:23,960
The money she spends on
her powder and perfume

1320
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,960
...what she earns
is just pittance!

1321
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:30,360
My grandson means the world to me

1322
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,960
I need to find out
what the problem is right now

1323
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:38,080
Send word to her mother and brother

1324
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:39,200
Let them come

1325
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:40,560
Ask them to come

1326
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:42,280
If it doesn't work...

1327
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:45,880
...I'll send her back saying
'please go with your mother'

1328
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,840
We can deal with the rest later

1329
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:08,600
Hey, Bharathi or Norathi!

1330
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:10,240
Open the door

1331
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:14,560
Hey Bharathi, open the door

1332
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:20,240
Sending your husband
to borrow money...

1333
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:22,640
...what are you doing
sitting at home?

1334
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:25,600
You think there's no one
to question you?

1335
01:34:25,640 --> 01:34:28,680
You'll learn your lesson only if
I send you back to your mother

1336
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:49,320
What are you doing over there?

1337
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:38,560
Hello, grandma

1338
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:53,320
'I had a splitting headache
all of a sudden one day'

1339
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:55,600
'Had irritation in my eyes too'

1340
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:58,960
'My husband took me to the hospital'

1341
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:03,440
Place your chin here

1342
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:08,080
Look at my left ear

1343
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:12,440
It's just an ordinary headache

1344
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:13,920
You'll be fine if you take rest

1345
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,560
Call your husband

1346
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:20,320
Please sit down

1347
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:24,480
This is a type of eye disorder

1348
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:27,600
It can be congenital
if the mother is afflicted by it

1349
01:36:27,640 --> 01:36:31,000
If parents are blood relatives
chances of children being affected is high

1350
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:32,960
It cannot be treated
Genetic disease

1351
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:35,600
Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy

1352
01:36:35,680 --> 01:36:38,160
Your wife can lose
her vision any time!

1353
01:37:32,920 --> 01:37:35,520
This is Leber's hereditary
optic neuropathy disease

1354
01:37:35,560 --> 01:37:37,760
This disease is hereditary

1355
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:39,840
Sorry, it has no cure

1356
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:42,120
Can be passed by genes
of mother to her child

1357
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:43,640
1st they'll become color blind

1358
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:46,720
And gradually lose their vision

1359
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:49,520
Replacing with a good eye won't work

1360
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:50,960
Don't waste your money

1361
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:52,640
Don't get cheated by anyone

1362
01:37:52,680 --> 01:37:54,240
Is there no other option?

1363
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:55,480
Sorry, Kannan

1364
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:59,080
Show your wife whatever she wishes
to see in this world as soon as you can

1365
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:01,960
Bharathi

1366
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:05,480
What did the doctor say?

1367
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:07,920
Nothing serious
Only stress it seems

1368
01:38:09,080 --> 01:38:11,200
You have a hectic schedule, right?

1369
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:13,920
You'll be fine
if we take off for a while

1370
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:15,640
Is that so?

1371
01:38:16,760 --> 01:38:17,720
Of course

1372
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:21,320
I say it all the time

1373
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:31,880
"Half the world has bright daylight
Even the other half is dipped in night"

1374
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:37,400
"Dearest, life exists beyond eyesight"

1375
01:39:37,480 --> 01:39:42,000
"Eyes can lie glibly
But the mind is honest truly"

1376
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:46,600
"Trust your mind
Good you'll find"

1377
01:39:46,640 --> 01:39:50,840
"Look at the world around you
with a new point of view"

1378
01:39:50,920 --> 01:39:54,960
"Accept how society looks at you anew"

1379
01:39:55,040 --> 01:40:00,440
"Don't sleep, sweetheart
Don't ever drift apart"

1380
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:05,040
"Apple of my eye, happy always
Connoisseur of live in all ways"

1381
01:40:05,120 --> 01:40:09,560
"You are my eyes precious"

1382
01:40:09,640 --> 01:40:14,160
"And I am yours, my princess"

1383
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:18,800
"Trust the U in you, my dear
It won't deplete, this love sincere"

1384
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:23,560
"I am your lover, my lovely wife"

1385
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:28,040
"I am your soul mate for life"

1386
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:57,760
I know there is
some problem with my vision

1387
01:40:58,120 --> 01:40:59,920
What if I'm unable to see you?

1388
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,520
Why are you being so foolish?

1389
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:04,680
Nothing like that
You are fine

1390
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:15,920
Darkness

1391
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:17,600
It's dark

1392
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:18,960
Bharathi...?

1393
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:20,520
I'm scared

1394
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:24,760
- Bharathi
- It's darkness all around me

1395
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:27,720
It's so dark
I'm scared

1396
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:28,760
Bharathi...?

1397
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:30,080
I can't see

1398
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:32,920
- Bharathi
- Kannan, I can't see anything

1399
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,920
- Don't worry
- What happened?

1400
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:36,280
What happened to me?

1401
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:38,400
I'm there for you
You will be okay

1402
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:40,320
It's pitch dark

1403
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:41,520
Pitch dark, Kannan

1404
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:43,160
I'm petrified

1405
01:41:44,120 --> 01:41:46,800
- I can't see anything
- Don't be scared, Bharathi

1406
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:47,960
Kannan...Kannan

1407
01:41:48,040 --> 01:41:49,640
I'm here Bharathi

1408
01:41:49,680 --> 01:41:52,360
- I can't see you
- I'm here with you

1409
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:53,800
Nothing to worry

1410
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:57,120
It's very dark

1411
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:05,720
I told him not to tell you, grandma

1412
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:08,960
As it is you don't like me

1413
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:13,680
If you got to know
I've lost my vision

1414
01:42:14,680 --> 01:42:17,000
I was worried
you might separate us

1415
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:20,160
I was the one who told him

1416
01:42:21,560 --> 01:42:24,080
Not to share anything with anyone

1417
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:29,960
Without anyone knowing...

1418
01:42:30,040 --> 01:42:34,400
...he believed he can get me treated
and cure me completely

1419
01:42:37,480 --> 01:42:38,880
Sorry, grandma

1420
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:42,240
For not telling you

1421
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:45,240
Please forgive me

1422
01:43:04,480 --> 01:43:06,960
Hey Karuppu
Where's everyone?

1423
01:43:07,240 --> 01:43:09,120
Your grandma and Muthulakshmi

1424
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:11,960
...gave a solid shelling
to that mongrel who hit you

1425
01:43:12,040 --> 01:43:13,120
'Then they came here'

1426
01:43:13,160 --> 01:43:14,760
They've rushed to your house angrily

1427
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:15,680
My house?

1428
01:43:15,720 --> 01:43:17,040
- Why?
- Why ask me?

1429
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:19,240
You messed it all up
Let's go home

1430
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:49,320
Bharathi...Bharathi

1431
01:44:09,080 --> 01:44:11,600
Bharathi's phone is ringing
But she isn't inside

1432
01:44:11,640 --> 01:44:14,680
I called your grandma too
But her phone is switched off

1433
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:18,640
Kanna, I just now saw your grandma
drag your wife somewhere

1434
01:44:18,720 --> 01:44:20,320
Any problem?

1435
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:21,480
Go to my place, quick

1436
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:24,520
If your phone is snatched away
half the problem will be solved

1437
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:41,680
What is it?

1438
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:43,640
I think we've run out of fuel

1439
01:45:55,640 --> 01:45:58,560
It's just body heat
That's all

1440
01:45:58,640 --> 01:46:01,040
Chithra, make sure the water
is lukewarm and just right

1441
01:46:01,080 --> 01:46:02,120
Okay, ma

1442
01:46:02,160 --> 01:46:05,240
Few days ago
even I had blurred vision

1443
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:08,520
I applied a handful of sesame oil
and gave my head a good massage

1444
01:46:08,600 --> 01:46:10,720
After my shower
I could see crystal clear

1445
01:46:10,760 --> 01:46:12,560
Sometimes because of body heat

1446
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:15,200
...it will affect the eyes
and you'll get a dizzy spell

1447
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:17,160
They won't understand all this

1448
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:19,640
Children these days have studied,
in fact too much

1449
01:46:19,720 --> 01:46:21,720
They won't know to assimilate

1450
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:23,840
If you take a bunch of
dwarf copper leaves

1451
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:29,640
Cook it with 'moong' dhal
and eat daily for 48 days

1452
01:46:29,720 --> 01:46:32,840
My husband has told me, you can
even see stars in the sky during the day

1453
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:36,920
95 years old and he never
wore glasses till he passed away

1454
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,640
He can see long distance
and at close range

1455
01:46:39,680 --> 01:46:41,120
His sight must have been 100/100

1456
01:46:41,160 --> 01:46:43,600
What is the problem
with your eyes, dear?

1457
01:46:43,640 --> 01:46:44,960
Whatever it is
we can handle it

1458
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:46,240
'Don't lose heart'

1459
01:46:46,280 --> 01:46:48,720
Chithra, check if the water
is neither too hot nor too cold

1460
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:50,640
'Don't just pour it'

1461
01:46:50,720 --> 01:46:52,200
'It's luke warm
and just right'

1462
01:46:52,280 --> 01:46:53,120
Let me see

1463
01:46:53,400 --> 01:46:54,280
Enough?

1464
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:55,960
Go and get a towel
We'll bathe her

1465
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,040
Pour gently
Take care

1466
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:11,360
Don't you know to discern
what to share and what to hide

1467
01:47:12,160 --> 01:47:14,280
You've got a degree to boot

1468
01:47:14,680 --> 01:47:18,040
I didn't want your wife
to continue working

1469
01:47:18,120 --> 01:47:20,920
Have I ever told you
'I don't like her?'

1470
01:47:21,400 --> 01:47:22,920
Her mother told me

1471
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:25,560
She can get transferred
to a different city suddenly

1472
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:27,360
What if she takes

1473
01:47:27,560 --> 01:47:29,720
...my grandson away from me?

1474
01:47:29,800 --> 01:47:31,200
What will I do then?

1475
01:47:34,120 --> 01:47:37,680
Listen, I'm the eldest in our family

1476
01:47:37,960 --> 01:47:40,640
Will I want to ruin
my own lineage?

1477
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:45,960
If you're my grandson
she's like a granddaughter to me

1478
01:47:47,200 --> 01:47:50,000
Forget it
She has lost only her vision

1479
01:47:50,040 --> 01:47:51,560
She can still breathe, right?

1480
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:53,760
She can cope and live happily'

1481
01:47:54,640 --> 01:47:56,680
Don't think about the expenditure

1482
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:59,200
I'll ensure her vision is restored

1483
01:47:59,320 --> 01:48:00,720
You work towards it

1484
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:02,200
Grandma

1485
01:48:05,440 --> 01:48:07,440
I got so scared, grandma

1486
01:48:09,280 --> 01:48:11,720
'Why, my dear?
What happened to you?'

1487
01:48:11,800 --> 01:48:13,200
I was so scared, grandma

1488
01:48:13,240 --> 01:48:14,760
'Nothing to worry'

1489
01:48:14,840 --> 01:48:17,840
'Your grandma is always here for you
I'll take care of everything'

1490
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:20,640
'Things will get back to normal'

1491
01:48:20,680 --> 01:48:22,560
'My guardian deity
will protect you'

1492
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:24,560
'Come, don't cry'

1493
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:35,200
"Come, my fair lady
My life's rhapsody"

1494
01:48:36,040 --> 01:48:43,720

won't alter in any circumstance"

1497
01:49:04,680 --> 01:49:12,520
"Will the height of the sky increase?"

1498
01:49:13,480 --> 01:49:19,640
"Or how will it ever decrease?"

1499
01:49:22,040 --> 01:49:30,080
"When rain-laden clouds descend
water to our soil is the dividend"

1500
01:50:07,640 --> 01:50:09,160
Sir, this is yours

1501
01:50:13,680 --> 01:50:15,480
Sir, I'm so glad
you're the manager

1502
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:16,960
Congratulations

1503
01:50:17,120 --> 01:50:18,840
I'm very happy

1504

"In love's eyes flaw isn't present"

1505
01:50:22,040 --> 01:50:23,800
She slaps me if I say
I don't want 'mehendi'

1506
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:25,160
What to do?

1507
01:50:26,360 --> 01:50:32,000
"If fault is found, love is then absent"

1508
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:37,840

We united here for eternity"

1516
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:52,640

for a work of art to emerge?"

1517
01:51:53,120 --> 01:51:55,680
"Parakeet's wing will remain green always"

1518
01:51:55,720 --> 01:51:57,760
Hey! Seer, you don't wear
saffron 'dhoti' huh?

1519
01:51:57,800 --> 01:51:59,280
I stopped
No more prophesies

1520
01:51:59,320 --> 01:52:03,080
Knowingly or unknowingly, my oracle
came true for a close family friend

1521
01:52:03,160 --> 01:52:07,440
So I'm no longer a medium of our deity
Being humane will do is my policy now

1522
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:10,160
Priest, this is Godliness!

1523
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:11,400
Come here

1524
01:52:12,080 --> 01:52:14,520
All the Gods will listen
to a true soul like you

1525
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:16,040
Bless her with sacred ash

1526
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:18,320
Goddess with a 1000 eyes

1527
01:52:18,480 --> 01:52:20,200
Grant eyesight to my child

1528
01:52:20,280 --> 01:52:21,960
Goddess Shakthi
Grant your power

1532
01:52:52,440 --> 01:52:53,200
Yes, doctor

1533
01:52:53,240 --> 01:52:54,960
A piece of good news
Mr Kamala Kannan

1534
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:56,680
My dean had called me yesterday

1535
01:52:56,720 --> 01:52:58,080
In AIMS hospital, New Delhi

1536
01:52:58,120 --> 01:53:01,200
...a senior doctor has joined
the Ophthalmology department

1537
01:53:01,280 --> 01:53:03,600
There's a chance of your wife
regaining her eyesight

1538
01:53:03,640 --> 01:53:05,080
We'll try our best

1539
01:53:05,120 --> 01:53:06,200
Let's have hope

1540
01:53:06,240 --> 01:53:09,080
Take your wife and
go to Delhi at once

1541
01:53:09,160 --> 01:53:11,880
I've fixed an appointment for you
I'll text you the doctor's #

1542
01:53:11,960 --> 01:53:12,920
Okay, Kannan?

1543
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:14,280
My wishes to Mrs Bharathi

1544
01:53:14,360 --> 01:53:15,840
Okay, doctor
We'll leave immediately

1545
01:53:15,880 --> 01:53:17,200
Thanks, doctor

1546
01:53:17,240 --> 01:53:19,080
Should we spend this much?

1547
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:25,720
Spend...you madcap!

1548
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:28,800
You are our family's asset

1549
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:32,240
You think you've lost
both your eyes?

1550
01:53:32,400 --> 01:53:34,960
There are a dozen eyes
to take care of you at home

1551
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Their prayers will protect us

1552
01:53:37,080 --> 01:53:38,800
Have faith and be positive

1553
01:53:51,560 --> 01:53:55,040
Bharathi, in a fit of rage, seeing you
walk with your head held high...

1554
01:53:55,120 --> 01:53:57,040
I said, 'she walks like Indira Gandhi'

1555
01:53:57,120 --> 01:53:58,720
Today you are going to Delhi!

1556
01:53:58,760 --> 01:54:00,720
