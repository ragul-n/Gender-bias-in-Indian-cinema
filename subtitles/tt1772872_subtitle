Today people are asking for our
party's funds

7
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:00,998
Their doubt can be dangerous for us

8
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,707
But l have an idea to make
their doubt wrong

9
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:08,910
Which idea?

10
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,691

This is the third time in this month

20
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:24,477
Until when we have to lie?

21
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:31,352
Since Vandana left us...

22
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:09,687
Every journalists need a story in
his career

00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:12,960
With the help of it he can
make his name

24

00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:28,133

They have reached your home

30
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:32,501
Do you have a nose?

31
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:46,923
We have to return them their
20 million in 10 days

32
00:13:57,469 --> 00:14:00,768
First they will break our fingers

33
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:06,509
Perhaps they will put iron rods in our eyes.
Stop kidding

34
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:10,572
You are not understanding.
We dont have money

35
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,466

What are you doing?

43
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:08,018
How can l say no to you?

44
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,356
Think how we will arrange 20 millions?

45
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,926
Cheque is in my hand

46
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:21,197

47
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:58,690

00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,704
Their is no phone network on
this island

51
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:12,243
How can l contact others?

52
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,904
Via Satellite.
Kabir Malhotra has satellite phone

53
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:24,051
ls Mr. Kabir Malhotra lives here?

54
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:27,324
ls this island belong to him?

55
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,785
Mr. Malhotra has bought this island

56
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:33,858
And he took the responsibilty for
all villagers

57
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:25,172
Malessa will bring you to your rooms

58
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:42,565
l have waited for 3 years
for this moment

59
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:58,839
lts priceless

60
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:05,811
Only flower of the world whose
flower grows after 8 years

61
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:29,705
You are a pimp

62
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:38,742
You are a murderer

63
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:41,443
He is saying rubbish

64
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:54,064
lt was just a trailer

65
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,423
Movie will start now

66
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:06,037
This story begun 20 years ago

67
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:12,882
There was a baby.
Very innocent

68
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,351
Why you are telling this to us?

69
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:27,363
l was saying she became
orphan by the age of 6

70
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:34,068
For rs 2000 she was sold to
orphan house of Thailand

71
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:40,002
lt was your orphan house

72
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:46,111
We never buy childrens.
We take them for care

73
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,955
A 6 year old girl was sent
to Thailand

74
00:24:56,194 --> 00:25:02,155
She was sent to a world which
is worst than a nightmare

75
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:14,977
Only her body was left.
She became prostitute

76
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:22,846
As much as money she earns,
her owner gets more profit

77
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:30,019
Her owner was a social worker
in the eyes of the world

78
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,301
l will kill you

79
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:43,407
How you can leave this island?

80
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:56,783
Do you think you have invited us
as a audience to show

81
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:18,633
As soon as she got chance she took
a help of European and run away

82
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,178
She tought now everything will be fine

83
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:25,877
But destiny cant be change with good
hopes

84
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:29,683
What happen with that girl?

85
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:40,662
An alone girl came to a strange city

86
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:02,380
She came to the biggest night
club of lstanbul

87
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:09,086
They give her a job of dancer

88
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:16,696
lt was just a fake.
Mr. Menon's real face was drugs

89
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:23,873
Then he forced her to sell drugs

90
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:37,044
You know l was about to say this is
not true. You are misunderstanding

91
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:47,024
After few months she went to lndia

92
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:52,195
Her death was held in the country
whom she born

93
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:58,866
Will you tell me?

94
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:10,754
Did you know that girl?

95
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:16,593
He did not know her. But he killed her

96
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:20,464
Who told you this?

97
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:26,569
Money is everything.
You can buy anything

98
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:29,938
Like l bought your make up man

99
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:35,207
Vikram Kapoor was coming from a party

100
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,513
He was drunk but he had
to drive

101
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:42,578
Then an innocent girl came
infront of his car

102
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:51,055
lt was an accident

103
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:54,924
But after that it was not an accident

104
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,005
We have to bring her to hospital

105
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:17,017
l cannot do this

106
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:24,019
My career will be gone.
She is dead

107
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:35,099
Bad destiny is not an easy task

108
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:42,010
She was still alive

109
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:53,315
Even after knowing this you
buried him alive

110
00:29:58,229 --> 00:30:01,426
Do you have any proof?

111
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:05,629
l dont like writing stories

112
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:15,838
Who was that girl?
She was my daughter

113
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,246
She was my and Malika's daughter

114
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:28,956
Malika came in my life 26 years ago

115
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:36,229
But l did not marry her

116
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:43,671
For forever

117
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,740
Then how do you she is your daughter?

118
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:58,589
3 years ago l got an letter

119
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:02,024
Malika wrote that letter to Sheja
when l was left

120
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:07,624
l came to know Malika was pregnant

121
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:12,834
Then she had 2 daughters

122
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:17,135
Twins.
Where is your 2nd daughter?

123
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:30,449
You are my 2nd daughter

124
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,884
lts true

125
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:44,790
l'm telling you l have my parents

126
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:50,372
l know you have parents but do you have
any childhood picture with them?

127
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:53,669
Do you know in which hospital
you were born?

128
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:59,510
May be your blood group is different
from them

129
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:02,982
You are my daughter

130
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:13,459
And She is your twin daughter

131
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:23,273
Her face is not like me

132
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:31,214
You are twins but not
the same face

133
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:39,189
People say twin's children can
never be twins

134
00:32:48,232 --> 00:32:50,928
You do mistake and we get punishment

135
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:54,896
You all 3 will get punishment

136
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,238
Since 3 years l'm collecting proofs
for you

137
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:45,782
You never tell me about Maya

138
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:57,897
l should not say this but
they all are very powerful man

139
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:04,902
lf the blame is wrong than they
will sue you

140
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:08,838
How can they do this?
l was sue 3 years ago

141
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:12,315
l was sue 3 years ago

142
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:48,851
Listen to me

143
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,582
Leave me alone

144
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:54,958
l have everything

145
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:59,289
But still myself very lonely

146
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:09,703
Now you think you will buy
me with your money?

147
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:12,333
You are my daughter

148
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:17,713
What do you know about this relation?

149
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:27,815
You can buy anything with your money

150
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,251
You are misunderstanding

151
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:39,069
Do you think you call him and you
will ruin their life than everything will be fine?

152
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:47,971
Truth is that you are responsible

153
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:00,384
she hates me

154
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:09,228
But not like that l hate myself

155
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:23,606
There is a stranger.
l dont care for you

156
00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:58,586
Smoking is not allowed here

157
00:44:59,797 --> 00:45:04,029
You always wake up so early or
is there anything special?

158
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:06,266
Always

159
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:12,207
lts good

160
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:17,671
lts so pity you will not see
celebration tonight

161
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:21,408
lts Mr. Malhotra's birthday

162
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:25,652
l still can feel yesterday's shock

163
00:45:46,977 --> 00:45:47,944
From where bullet sound came?

164
00:45:48,445 --> 00:45:51,209
He is inside

165
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:05,189
We have to break door

166
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:09,450
Call whole team here

167
00:49:51,788 --> 00:49:54,154
We got Mr. Malhotra's report

168
00:49:54,858 --> 00:49:56,485
He had Pancreatic cancer

169
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:15,878
You do mistake and we get punishment

170
00:50:17,547 --> 00:50:21,779
You all will get punishment.
l have arranged proofs for you in 3 years

171
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:08,225
There is no other way to go inside
except door

172
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:16,272
Pistol belong to Mr Malhotra.
Bullet and guns matches

173
00:51:20,977 --> 00:51:31,046
We got gun powder traces.
Location of gun power is bullet is correct

174
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:50,034
Unless Mr Malhotra knew it his
life is in danger

175
00:51:50,674 --> 00:51:52,972
Thats why he called us here in Samos

176
00:51:55,212 --> 00:51:59,080
and his 4 guests whom he
blamed

177
00:52:14,531 --> 00:52:16,465
ls he a murderer?

178
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:20,726
lf its true than his career will be finished

179
00:52:25,075 --> 00:52:28,977
His name must be on
all the wanted list of the world

180
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:42,888
After knowing that truth does he really
hates him that he killed him

181
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:48,761
He will get all the property

182
00:52:49,299 --> 00:52:51,062
lt was it Mr Malhotra's will

183
00:52:51,701 --> 00:52:53,794
But we found his will burned
in dust bin

184
00:52:56,506 --> 00:53:00,033
Where is that proof of which
Mr Malhotra discussed?

185
00:53:06,983 --> 00:53:10,077
Why Mr Malhotra commit suicide?

186
00:53:25,569 --> 00:53:27,469
These days l seldom see you

187
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:30,806
Have you ever think of wearing glasses?

188
00:53:36,313 --> 00:53:38,372
Where you were when bullet was shot?

189
00:53:39,482 --> 00:53:42,007
l dont have time for silly questions

190
00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:49,481
l was in Samara in my hall

191
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:56,097
Last night he came into my room
to say sorry

192
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:07,006
he agreed

193
00:54:11,815 --> 00:54:16,013
He only had 1 key.
He never lock door

194
00:54:17,187 --> 00:54:20,452
Key was useless.
Did you break the door?

195
00:54:22,392 --> 00:54:25,850
l tried to break it

196
00:54:26,396 --> 00:54:31,095
l tried to break glass with
candle stand? so that l can open door

197
00:54:35,972 --> 00:54:40,136
He shooted himself here

198
00:54:43,913 --> 00:54:44,607
What you touched in the room?

199
00:54:45,749 --> 00:54:48,013
l checked his heartbeat

200
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:50,815
Why he blame you?
May be for publicity

201
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:56,050
l have even never killed a mosquito

202
00:54:56,726 --> 00:54:59,490
Then may be you are the 1st
person of this world

203
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:04,900
There was a jug on the desk

204
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:08,834
l stopped fire with it

205
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:11,700
Why you burn his will?

206
00:55:15,912 --> 00:55:17,777
l dont know anything about his will.
l did not see it. He wanted to buy mr

207
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:26,148
Thats why he killed himself

208
00:55:33,697 --> 00:55:36,325
Since 3 years he was planning for this day

209
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:42,933
He was saying after killing these 3
them he will get peace

210
00:55:46,209 --> 00:55:49,440
l never thought he mean that

211
00:56:06,896 --> 00:56:08,488
What did he say?

212
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:16,699
Where is that proof?

213
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:21,043
Did anyone steal it?

214
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:24,570
May be he did not have any proof

215
00:56:29,986 --> 00:56:34,787
Now what? We dont anything
except Mr Malhotra's words

216
00:57:15,398 --> 00:57:18,026
First time l'm feeling good by
leaving any place

217
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:23,638
l dont understand.
What about that evidence?

218
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:26,267
There was not any evidence

219
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:30,439
Kabir Malhotra was a mad person

220
00:57:31,414 --> 00:57:35,009
He tried to trap us and when he was
unsuccesful than he committed suicide

221
00:57:48,998 --> 00:57:50,329
We will follow everyone

222
00:57:54,671 --> 00:57:57,504
lnvestigate everything on tape

223
00:57:57,974 --> 00:58:01,842
Start suveillance of everyone.

226
01:00:58,087 --> 01:01:00,578
Only Maya

227
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:06,158
A good girl like you what is doing
in my club?

228
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:21,620
There're many things about
me which you dont know..!

229
01:08:25,968 --> 01:08:28,129
Whatever l know is sufficient for me.

230
01:09:51,654 --> 01:09:53,212

The seat you've been sat..
how much is it worthy for you?

239
01:18:04,913 --> 01:18:07,143
You'll have to say sorry to
the nation of bhaijan.

240
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:09,742
lf l'd tell them truth so?

241
01:18:12,387 --> 01:18:13,217
Truth?

242
01:18:15,323 --> 01:18:17,587
The advantures of o.p ramsai

243
01:18:19,628 --> 01:18:21,619
The file kabeer malhotra made

245
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:27,794

Who was he?

248
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:50,650
We've to think calmly

249
01:18:51,927 --> 01:18:54,487
What is the guarantee
that he got that file

250
01:18:56,465 --> 01:18:57,329
because l ve'nt that file

251
01:19:02,304 --> 01:19:03,168
Do you know what is it in that file?

252
01:19:04,639 --> 01:19:05,298
it contains all me criminal
activity details...

253
01:19:06,908 --> 01:19:07,932

lt all happend of that malhotra.

256
01:19:17,486 --> 01:19:19,579
lf he'd not commited suicide..
l'd kill him

257
01:19:20,989 --> 01:19:22,354
But we've destroyed
all the proofs.

258
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:28,488
lf anyone have any
proof against me..

259
01:19:39,407 --> 01:19:41,500
Now that's what l call
a prefect confession

260

265
01:22:10,125 --> 01:22:11,524
Mumbai police found the eliton's dead body

266
01:22:15,597 --> 01:22:16,393
His name was on tape

267
01:22:16,965 --> 01:22:20,401
Mr.malhotra said that eliton was with maya
in the car when maya crashed the car

268
01:22:23,672 --> 01:22:24,434
but..

269
01:22:24,806 --> 01:22:25,704

274
01:23:01,443 --> 01:23:02,102

275
01:23:03,144 --> 01:23:03,974
completely rubbish short.

276
01:23:34,609 --> 01:23:36,975
in the convention of the capital
of italy.

277
01:23:37,545 --> 01:23:38,534
The entire public's unity

278
01:24:00,535 --> 01:24:03,993
Bollywood's super star vikram kapoor
will be called by c.b.i for iterogation

279
01:24:04,706 --> 01:24:09,666
police found his makeup man's
dead body on hotel's terrace

280
01:24:10,412 --> 01:24:13,779
lts 2nd time the name of vikram
kapoor is linked with a death

281
01:24:14,416 --> 01:24:15,610
First industrilist kabir malhotra

282
01:24:16,317 --> 01:24:17,147
and then eliton

283
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:22,117
Now we've to see what his upcoming
movie will get affected by this

284
01:24:36,404 --> 01:24:37,393
We're standing out the house
of vikram kapoor

285
01:24:37,972 --> 01:24:39,098
he's not at home

286
01:24:39,674 --> 01:24:41,665
lts more strange that there's
no his servents present

287
01:25:29,858 --> 01:25:31,325

what're you doing here?

288
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:33,818
how did you get in?

289
01:25:40,869 --> 01:25:41,460
what do you want?

290
01:25:44,739 --> 01:25:46,400
l want to see the fear in your eyes.

291
01:25:51,913 --> 01:25:55,178
Same fear you saw in maya's eyes
when you buried her alive.

292
01:25:58,419 --> 01:25:59,351
lt was just an accident?

293
01:26:02,557 --> 01:26:04,422
this is a accident for me too

294
01:27:35,383 --> 01:27:37,374
l got news from andheri police station

295
01:27:38,052 --> 01:27:40,247
they got the call telling that
he's the murderer of maya

296
01:30:06,901 --> 01:30:08,300
what did he say?

297
01:30:11,372 --> 01:30:12,703
which we are told to say

298
01:33:53,027 --> 01:33:53,550
its opened

299
01:34:01,035 --> 01:34:02,024
you should never leave the door open

300
01:34:05,072 --> 01:34:06,039
who knows who will come in

301
01:34:09,410 --> 01:34:15,144
sit..
we need to talk

302
01:34:15,816 --> 01:34:16,475
talk about what?

303
01:34:21,622 --> 01:34:22,520
want to tell you the truth

304
01:34:23,591 --> 01:34:24,785
may be you'll feel good.

305
01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:27,622
really?
shall we start?

306
01:34:29,530 --> 01:34:31,191
from bankok ..o.p ramsai

307
01:34:33,234 --> 01:34:34,258
guilty..
and vikram kapoor.?

308
01:34:37,071 --> 01:34:38,231
l've linked him with police.

309
01:34:46,113 --> 01:34:47,705
lnfact, i wasn't with him
when he commited suicide.

310
01:34:48,683 --> 01:34:49,809
So how come you know he's dead.

311
01:34:50,418 --> 01:34:51,715
the police department knows this.

312
01:34:55,523 --> 01:34:57,252
you might have phone.

313
01:36:02,923 --> 01:36:03,821
are you a police officer?

314
01:36:29,750 --> 01:36:31,650
So what do l call you?
nil or arjun?

315
01:36:34,722 --> 01:36:35,780
there's no need to mess up this case more

316
01:36:49,236 --> 01:36:50,999
so you do think too that the kabir
got killed.

317
01:36:54,809 --> 01:36:57,334
Human has some strange habits

318
01:36:58,179 --> 01:36:59,271
as .

319
01:36:59,914 --> 01:37:02,382
when the drink wine while smoking..

320
01:37:03,284 --> 01:37:06,378
So their glass would must
be in their left hand.

321
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:14,222
Like a kabir malhotra..
l'm also left handed.

322
01:37:29,677 --> 01:37:33,545
lf he's left handed...
so why he driggered gun from right hand.

323
01:37:40,588 --> 01:37:41,111
but who?

324
01:37:42,756 --> 01:37:44,621
there's a tale in a latin language

325
01:37:48,629 --> 01:37:49,288
who's benificiry?

326
01:37:54,101 --> 01:37:56,035
we've to reexamine all evidence.

327
01:37:57,338 --> 01:37:58,430
meet you at ariport in hour

328
01:38:05,312 --> 01:38:07,007
why're you doing all this for kabir malhotra

329
01:38:10,618 --> 01:38:13,246
not doing for him

330
01:38:43,317 --> 01:38:47,310
will was distributed in 3 parts.
first one was in charity

331
01:38:49,290 --> 01:38:51,121
1 m euro for his staff..
and remaining for aisha..

332
01:38:52,092 --> 01:38:53,354
and now that will has been burnt

333
01:38:55,362 --> 01:38:57,626
according to law...

334
01:38:58,632 --> 01:39:00,190
mr.malhotra died before making will

335
01:39:00,935 --> 01:39:04,336
Means...his only heir will get his wealth

336
01:42:16,864 --> 01:42:18,024
what had happend?

337
01:42:21,168 --> 01:42:22,328
i dont know

338
01:42:23,270 --> 01:42:24,498
why did you attemted to kill yourself

339
01:42:29,810 --> 01:42:30,902
l didn't attempted

340
01:42:39,953 --> 01:42:41,250
Suddenly..
l dont know what happend but...

341
01:42:41,788 --> 01:42:42,720
l got unconcious.

342
01:42:56,503 --> 01:42:57,492
what's all happenig

343
01:43:15,522 --> 01:43:17,854
What's that mean?
what someone wants to kill tisha?

344
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:23,560
Look mr.khanna..
its very nesssary which l'm saying

345
01:43:40,414 --> 01:43:41,005
tisha got attacked.

346
01:43:42,049 --> 01:43:42,743
but now she's fine

347
01:43:44,318 --> 01:43:47,810
Eventhen you said to mr.khanna
that tell everyone that she's dead

348
01:43:51,558 --> 01:43:53,924
How come you know..
because l'd have said that.

349
01:43:57,331 --> 01:43:58,559
so its clear

350
01:43:59,333 --> 01:44:00,493
that the murdered is hiden somewhere

351
01:44:02,936 --> 01:44:04,403
Or tisha is laying....so we dont doubt at her

352
01:44:07,708 --> 01:44:08,402
it may possible.

353
01:44:09,376 --> 01:44:10,604
Who'll get anything by killing aisha?

354
01:44:11,378 --> 01:44:12,845
10 b euro

355
01:44:18,218 --> 01:44:21,517
ask to mr.malhotras' lawyer that
who's benificiry after aisha.

356
01:44:23,190 --> 01:44:26,284
that question is who wants to kill aisha

357
01:44:34,868 --> 01:44:36,028
who want to kill mr.malhotra.

358
01:46:14,534 --> 01:46:17,970
its been 3 months..you always says
that you'll come.

359
01:46:21,475 --> 01:46:22,635

360
01:46:25,278 --> 01:46:27,337
l've called you to tell you

361
01:46:31,284 --> 01:46:32,911
l'm sure that's the final thing
which you want to hear.

362
01:48:08,815 --> 01:48:12,774
Mr.malhotra sent this fax

363
01:48:10,984 --> 01:48:12,645
malhotra's family is benificiry
after aisha.

364
01:48:24,297 --> 01:48:25,696
KAbir malhotra's brother who was exciled
from his heir

365
01:48:29,302 --> 01:48:31,429
but why?

366
01:48:37,711 --> 01:48:40,976
and then..
kabir would never helped him

367
01:48:50,991 --> 01:48:53,687
Do you know what is the connection
between this papers and chemicals

368
01:48:54,961 --> 01:48:55,450
no

369
01:50:02,095 --> 01:50:04,825
did he ever went out the hospital
since in these 5 years.

370
01:50:09,135 --> 01:50:10,329
patients can be go and come anytime

371
01:50:11,838 --> 01:50:14,739
As far i know that mr.malhotra
never went out

372
01:50:16,176 --> 01:50:17,234
Who used to come to meet him

373
01:50:18,912 --> 01:50:19,503
no body

374
01:50:20,380 --> 01:50:21,244
he's all alone

375
01:50:22,616 --> 01:50:24,709
previously her daughter used
to send latters

376
01:50:25,585 --> 01:50:26,279
now its stopped..
why?

377
01:51:35,922 --> 01:51:36,479
streight thing

378
01:51:43,596 --> 01:51:44,460
her daughters latter

379
01:51:54,374 --> 01:51:54,897
so what is this?

380
01:51:59,345 --> 01:52:01,142
lf her daughter died in january

381
01:52:02,315 --> 01:52:03,976
So how come she wrote that
latter in june?

382
01:52:09,989 --> 01:52:12,253
its mean...murderer is natasha malhotra.

383
01:52:14,494 --> 01:52:15,256
but where's she?

384
01:53:27,600 --> 01:53:28,328
5 years ago

385
01:53:37,644 --> 01:53:38,338
he hadn't knew her

386
01:53:43,383 --> 01:53:44,247
but samara knows him

387
01:54:19,352 --> 01:54:22,549
Mr.malhotra dont know that when
he was telling us truth

388
01:54:23,389 --> 01:54:24,287
but where's your 2nd daughter/

389
01:54:24,891 --> 01:54:27,257
So its very big shock..
you're my 2nd daughter

390
01:54:35,235 --> 01:54:36,964
as you came to know about tisha.

391
01:54:38,271 --> 01:54:40,330
The kabir's death
was nessecary

392
01:54:41,608 --> 01:54:43,337
before he changes his will

393
01:54:46,713 --> 01:54:51,480
You might have think that police
will reach here and see guest like us

394
01:54:52,752 --> 01:54:54,481
and you'll show them that video
recording..

395
01:54:55,154 --> 01:54:56,348
you made a mistake..
and we get the punishment.

396
01:56:18,171 --> 01:56:19,695
when we heared the fire shot

397
01:56:25,878 --> 01:56:26,401
plan was good.

398
01:56:27,513 --> 01:56:29,743
just needed two things

399
01:56:32,852 --> 01:56:33,409
a evidence

400
01:56:34,354 --> 01:56:38,085
who can tell that when fire shot
the time you were'nt there.

401
01:57:34,614 --> 01:57:37,014
lF you've finished your storyx

402
01:57:42,688 --> 01:57:44,383
but l think...its not your house.

403
01:57:45,158 --> 01:57:45,852
its tisha's house.

404
01:57:47,427 --> 01:57:50,919
and l think tisha is not alive

405
01:57:53,099 --> 01:57:56,535
what do you think..
only you can fool people

406
01:57:58,938 --> 01:58:00,166
tisha is alive.

407
01:58:06,913 --> 01:58:10,713
lf you people would have the proof
of it so... we have it.

408
01:58:12,919 --> 01:58:14,352
your finger prints

409
01:59:13,779 --> 01:59:15,474
listen to me

410
01:59:16,415 --> 01:59:18,178
lf the key was in the door.

411
01:59:20,620 --> 01:59:24,056
So how come your finger prints
sticked on the center barrel

412
01:59:26,626 --> 01:59:31,120
lf you've twisted the key only
as you said now.

413
01:59:33,266 --> 01:59:35,598
so you finger prints would not
been sticked there.

414
02:00:44,303 --> 02:00:47,898
You're the mastermind of the game

415
02:00:49,542 --> 02:00:50,509
put down your pistol

416
02:01:03,489 --> 02:01:04,717
if l'd have the pistol

417
02:01:05,691 --> 02:01:06,851
so you'd not be alive that time

418
02:01:40,259 --> 02:01:41,419
lf i'd not seen those pictures

419
02:01:42,762 --> 02:01:45,060
So l'd never get to know that
you and kabir are twince

420
02:01:47,066 --> 02:01:50,467
and people says that the twince
can't have twince baby

421
02:02:10,523 --> 02:02:13,924
adult should not do some work
in front of kids.

422
02:02:15,528 --> 02:02:16,586
they can be bad affected

423
02:03:53,759 --> 02:03:55,624
How come you got in doubt that
the sound was not of gun fire.

424
02:03:59,565 --> 02:04:00,463
l'm alergic to gun powder

425
02:04:02,601 --> 02:04:06,401
Specially the crackers
