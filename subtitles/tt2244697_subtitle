1
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:23,027
15 years later...

2
00:03:23,565 --> 00:03:25,192
Central Jail, Cherlapalli

3
00:03:52,094 --> 00:03:54,392
Why did you bring him like a beast?

4
00:03:54,596 --> 00:03:56,063
He's also a human like us.

5
00:03:56,265 --> 00:03:57,562
Remove the shackles.

6
00:03:57,933 --> 00:04:00,401
lt's very difficult to control
him without shackles, sir.

7
00:04:01,603 --> 00:04:03,901
l'm warning you as the
leader of the ruling party,

8
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,067
not a DGP would remain in post,

9
00:04:07,609 --> 00:04:10,077
will you free him
or get suspended?

10
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:15,238
l want to interrogate him,
all of you please leave.

11
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:22,916
Attempting to kill Ramakrishna Prasad,

12
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:26,754
undisputed leader of 11
constituencies in Rayalaseema,

13
00:04:26,962 --> 00:04:30,261
you'd tried many times
to escape from jail,

14
00:04:31,467 --> 00:04:34,925
now, you've got the
opportunity to kill him.

15
00:04:36,638 --> 00:04:39,766
We and our system is behind you

16
00:04:40,309 --> 00:04:43,278
lf you kill him,
you'd have your revenge,

17
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:46,778
and we'd win all the
11 constituencies,

18
00:04:46,982 --> 00:04:48,950
and form the next government.

19
00:04:49,151 --> 00:04:53,679
You'd kill me in an encounter
after l kill him.

20
00:04:55,324 --> 00:05:01,627
You'd claim to have shot the
killer of Ramakrishna in 24 hours,

21
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,798
and win the next elections,

22
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:05,466
this is your plan !

23
00:05:09,505 --> 00:05:11,803
lndeed that was DGP's original plan.

24
00:05:13,842 --> 00:05:16,310
But l'm promising you,

25
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,149
as soon as we form the
new government,

26
00:05:22,518 --> 00:05:26,386
we'll free you using mercy petition,

27
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:32,388
and make you undisputed
leader of Rayalaseema.

28
00:05:42,538 --> 00:05:45,837
You're planning to kill
Ramakrishna Prasad,

29
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,066
and have his man as the security,

30
00:05:48,544 --> 00:05:50,341
that is your system!

31
00:05:58,053 --> 00:06:02,353
There's no man to touch
Ramakrishna in Rayalaseema

32
00:06:03,559 --> 00:06:04,355
Go away!

33
00:06:05,227 --> 00:06:08,196
Nagulappa, Ramakrishna's niece
is going tomorrow to Vizag,

34
00:06:08,397 --> 00:06:09,694
if we lock her up there?

35
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:13,527
The man who would do
anything for people,

36
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:16,537
he'd definitely come
for his family!

37
00:06:16,738 --> 00:06:19,366
lf you can make him come out
of Rayalaseema alone,

38
00:06:19,575 --> 00:06:23,534
l've kept ready the
weapon to kill him.

39
00:06:42,097 --> 00:06:43,394
You ran very well!

40
00:07:00,782 --> 00:07:03,410
We're now at the residence of
Central Minister Nitish Patel,

41
00:07:03,619 --> 00:07:06,588
last night a girl Nikisha
was brutally murdered,

42
00:07:06,788 --> 00:07:09,256
but there are rumours that
it could be a suicide,

43
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:13,417
but Nikisha's father said to media
that it was a brutal murder.

44
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:17,258
And accuses Central Minister
Nitish Patel's son Sanjay Patel!

45
00:07:17,466 --> 00:07:21,095
Just a while ago Nikisha's father
came to meet the Central Minister.

46
00:07:25,807 --> 00:07:26,774
Who is he?

47
00:07:28,143 --> 00:07:31,112
Father of the dead girl Nikisha.
Your father called him here.

48
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,777
Would sensitive people have this?

49
00:07:33,982 --> 00:07:35,779
Get me a hangover peg, go!

50
00:07:36,985 --> 00:07:41,115
Media and people are anxious about
Nikisha's father meeting the Minister

51
00:07:41,323 --> 00:07:44,451
We can't get any information till
Nikisha's father emerges out.

52
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,787
This is Sandhya with
Cameraman Ravi for Zee news.

53
00:07:50,499 --> 00:07:52,296
What happened to the Goregaon meeting?
- lt's postponed, sir.

54
00:07:52,501 --> 00:07:54,969
Fix a meeting with Hiranandani.
- Okay sir.

55
00:07:55,837 --> 00:07:56,861
Nikisha's father!

56
00:07:57,673 --> 00:07:58,640
Keep it in your pocket.

57
00:07:59,007 --> 00:08:00,804
Our Nikisha's father?
- Yes.

58
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:03,136
Greetings sir.
Are you doing fine?

59
00:08:03,345 --> 00:08:05,313
Please sit down...

60
00:08:05,847 --> 00:08:07,314
May you be blessed with long life.

61
00:08:07,516 --> 00:08:10,314
Sit properly before elders, you fool!

62
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:13,146
When our girl got so much injustice,

63
00:08:13,355 --> 00:08:17,314
media people are busy promoting her
like Mallika Sheravat!

64
00:08:20,028 --> 00:08:22,155
He's studying in America.

65
00:08:22,364 --> 00:08:25,822
People go on dating and
chatting before marriage.

66
00:08:26,034 --> 00:08:28,161
He too got afflicted with
that disease.

67
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:33,831
You've raised your daughter with
discipline and values of middle class.

68
00:08:34,876 --> 00:08:38,505
This incident took place as
a conflict of cultures,

69
00:08:38,714 --> 00:08:41,683
people who should ensure security and
justice by implementing law properly,

70
00:08:41,883 --> 00:08:44,681
leaving the old trend, they've joined
the bandwagon of new business trend,

71
00:08:44,886 --> 00:08:47,013
and made crores overnight!

72
00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:49,016
Why are you boring me with this?

73
00:08:49,224 --> 00:08:50,350
Why did you call me here?

74
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:52,527
You fool, keep quiet!

75
00:08:53,562 --> 00:08:56,030
l'd called you to make your
daughter my daughter-in-law.

76
00:08:56,231 --> 00:08:59,530
Like chicken are grown in farms
for people like us to eat,

77
00:08:59,735 --> 00:09:05,537
you poor raise daughters to get
raped by sons of people like us.

78
00:09:05,741 --> 00:09:09,040
Even after a life of hard work,
you can't celebrate a festival happily,

79
00:09:09,244 --> 00:09:11,212
are you getting so much
coverage on TV?

80
00:09:11,413 --> 00:09:13,040
Where's justice in this country?

81
00:09:13,248 --> 00:09:15,716
To say you and your daughter
were meted with injustice.

82
00:09:15,917 --> 00:09:23,551
Will you damage 40 years of
my political life in just one day!

83
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:24,555
lsn't that injustice?

84
00:09:26,595 --> 00:09:28,893
TV media will cover only
till the body is cremated.

85
00:09:32,768 --> 00:09:35,066
Take this cheque,
it's Rs.10 lakhs!

86
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:38,398
You assassinated my son's character
before the media,

87
00:09:38,607 --> 00:09:41,906
correct it now before the same media.
Take it.

88
00:09:42,611 --> 00:09:45,079
No.
- Don't you want money?

89
00:09:45,781 --> 00:09:48,909
ls his elder daughter Lakshmi
good to look?

90
00:09:49,117 --> 00:09:55,078
She's more beautiful
than the dead girl, daddy.

91
00:09:57,793 --> 00:09:58,919
Very good!

92
00:09:59,127 --> 00:10:03,757
Make currency your life trend,
you'd be happy always! Go!

93
00:10:04,633 --> 00:10:05,930
May you be blessed with long life!

94
00:10:07,969 --> 00:10:09,095
Give me the ear bud!

95
00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:12,766
Call MDTV people.
- Okay sir.

96
00:10:12,974 --> 00:10:14,942
Why did you meet the Minister?

97
00:10:15,143 --> 00:10:16,269
Why did Minister invite you here?

98
00:10:16,478 --> 00:10:17,945
Has Minister promised to do justice?

99
00:10:18,146 --> 00:10:20,444
They say Sanjay has no bad habits,
what's your reaction?

100
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:21,616
Please tell us, sir.

101
00:10:21,817 --> 00:10:24,445
l'll accept the truth before you.

102
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,120
My daughter took to bad ways and
visited clubs and pubs often,

103
00:10:29,324 --> 00:10:31,121
and became a drug addict,

104
00:10:31,326 --> 00:10:34,784
in an inebriated condition,
she committed suicide,

105
00:10:36,164 --> 00:10:38,132
anyway my dead daughter
wouldn't come back,

106
00:10:38,834 --> 00:10:43,134
with a bad intention of making
quick money with her death,

107
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,637
l made a false accusation
against Minister's son.

108
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:49,807
Did you see a middle class
man's intentions?

109
00:10:50,011 --> 00:10:52,639
To make money from his
daughter's death,

110
00:10:52,848 --> 00:10:55,476
he made wild accusations
against the Minister.

111
00:10:55,684 --> 00:10:59,313
lt has been proved once again that
poor are jealous of the rich !

112
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:05,819
Party workers are celebrating!
Please close the door!

113
00:11:08,196 --> 00:11:10,664
Congratulations on behalf of MDTV.

114
00:11:11,533 --> 00:11:14,832
l'll ask you an exclusive question,
please answer it, sir.

115
00:11:15,036 --> 00:11:15,832
Please!

116
00:11:16,037 --> 00:11:19,165
lt is said your son is eunuch
and not a man at all!

117
00:11:20,542 --> 00:11:24,171
How can he rape a girl?
A TV channel ran it on scroll!

118
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:26,176
What's your reaction on it?

119
00:11:27,549 --> 00:11:30,177
Get me the sisters of the
man who said that,

120
00:11:30,385 --> 00:11:33,684
l'll show you right before the
media whether l'm a man or not!

121
00:13:47,022 --> 00:13:49,991
Don't harm me, l'll go away!

122
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:12,173
With your son's dirty work,
many people got rich !

123
00:14:13,048 --> 00:14:17,508
Even professional killers who do
jobs for others must settle, right?

124
00:14:17,719 --> 00:14:19,846
What? Are you a killer?

125
00:14:20,221 --> 00:14:23,349
Don't kill my son,
l'll pay whatever you ask!

126
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:26,926
Neither you can stop death
with money nor buy me!

127
00:14:27,729 --> 00:14:31,529
Yours is pure business and
mine is pure devotion !

128
00:14:34,235 --> 00:14:41,607
Look, how clash of two cultures is
leading to a devastating incident!

129
00:14:42,243 --> 00:14:44,871
Don't kill him, please him alive,
that's enough !

130
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,377
l'll accept the truth
before the media.

131
00:14:46,581 --> 00:14:48,048
l'll ensure justice prevails!

132
00:14:49,918 --> 00:14:54,287
Hail Nitish Patel!
Hail Sanjay Patel!

133
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:58,287
Minister promises justice,
connect this cable and go live!

134
00:15:01,096 --> 00:15:04,224
Respected people of Maharashtra,

135
00:15:04,432 --> 00:15:08,391
my son Sanjay Patel raped and
murdered innocent girl Nikisha,

136
00:15:08,603 --> 00:15:14,235
threatening Nikisha's father and
forced him to lie before the media,

137
00:15:14,442 --> 00:15:19,072
l'm enlightened after
an exclusive interview by Kittu,

138
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:24,741
my son who could escape from law
couldn't escape from me,

139
00:15:24,953 --> 00:15:27,649
l've punished him myself,

140
00:15:33,628 --> 00:15:38,759
l've ensured justice prevails,
please don't kill my son.

141
00:15:38,967 --> 00:15:41,094
Please leave my son !

142
00:15:41,469 --> 00:15:45,428
Birth, death and my decision
are irrevocable!

143
00:15:53,648 --> 00:15:54,774
l'm eternally indebted to you.

144
00:15:54,983 --> 00:15:57,781
You took revenge on my behalf,
take these Rs.10 lakhs!

145
00:15:58,486 --> 00:16:02,946
Killing one is satisfaction to pocket,
killing another is job satisfaction.

146
00:16:03,158 --> 00:16:06,958
You were hurt as father,
and l reacted as a brother!

147
00:16:07,328 --> 00:16:08,625
This satisfaction is enough.

148
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:11,798
Celebrate your elder daughter's
marriage grandly with this money.

149
00:16:13,501 --> 00:16:14,297
No problem.

150
00:16:22,844 --> 00:16:25,142
Whether it is in earth or
as part of God's ornaments,

151
00:16:25,346 --> 00:16:26,643
diamond is diamond!

152
00:16:27,015 --> 00:16:29,483
Your parents are blessed ones
to have a son like you.

153
00:16:29,684 --> 00:16:32,312
You're speaking as if you know
my parents very well.

154
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,988
Had l know them, l would've
handed you to them long back!

155
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:37,988
l found you when you were just
2 years and raising you since then,

156
00:16:38,193 --> 00:16:40,661
don't you trust me?

157
00:16:58,546 --> 00:16:59,513
Did you see the SMS?

158
00:16:59,714 --> 00:17:01,181
l'll call you in 10 minutes.

159
00:17:01,549 --> 00:17:04,074
Who is it?
- Old friend.

160
00:17:13,728 --> 00:17:14,854
When did you come out
of jail, brother?

161
00:17:15,063 --> 00:17:18,760
l'll tell you later,
you've understood the plan, right?- Got it.

162
00:17:19,234 --> 00:17:21,862
Before signing the contract to kill,

163
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:25,198
he always checks if his victim is
good man or bad before killing.

164
00:17:27,408 --> 00:17:30,536
lf he comes to know the next
assignment is to kill his own father,

165
00:17:30,745 --> 00:17:35,045
he would turn against
and pack all of us to hell!

166
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,218
He's not the right man
for this assignment.

167
00:17:37,418 --> 00:17:39,045
Please allow me to live peacefully.

168
00:18:07,615 --> 00:18:10,413
You've decided, l know it.

169
00:18:11,619 --> 00:18:14,747
l could make you a killer
but not a criminal.

170
00:18:16,124 --> 00:18:20,754
People of 11 constituencies of
Rayalaseema revere your father as God.

171
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:25,258
Unable to win over your father
in consecutive elections there,

172
00:18:25,967 --> 00:18:28,765
they couldn't even dare
touch a strand of his hair,

173
00:18:29,304 --> 00:18:31,101
they're plotting to kill him,

174
00:18:32,974 --> 00:18:36,102
this phone has all the
details of that plan,

175
00:18:37,145 --> 00:18:39,272
you'd kill me if l tell
why l raised you?

176
00:18:39,647 --> 00:18:40,944
You'd kill even if l don't!

177
00:18:42,817 --> 00:18:44,614
l don't want to die in your hands.

178
00:19:21,689 --> 00:19:24,988
Thanks, if you'd delayed giving your
hand even for a moment,

179
00:19:25,193 --> 00:19:26,319
l would've missed the train.

180
00:19:26,527 --> 00:19:30,327
lf l hadn't helped you,
l would've missed you.

181
00:19:30,698 --> 00:19:35,499
l said we met now because you
gave hand at right time.

182
00:19:46,547 --> 00:19:47,514
Are you also in the same coupE?

183
00:19:47,715 --> 00:19:50,183
ls it too small for us?

184
00:19:51,386 --> 00:19:53,684
Why are you talking strangely?

185
00:19:53,888 --> 00:19:55,515
To appear special.

186
00:19:58,226 --> 00:20:00,524
l thought you're a daring woman
for boarding a running train.

187
00:20:01,229 --> 00:20:03,356
You too know what fear is!

188
00:20:04,899 --> 00:20:06,025
Do you know who am l?
- l'd know if you tell, right?

189
00:20:07,068 --> 00:20:10,367
Budda Vengal Reddy,

190
00:20:10,571 --> 00:20:13,369
Bharatsimha Reddy,
Narasimha Naidu,

00:20:13,574 --> 00:20:17,032
lndrasena Reddy,
did you hear these names?

192
00:20:17,578 --> 00:20:19,375
Aren't they Rayalaseema batch?

193
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,377
My uncle is much more powerful
than all of them.

194
00:20:21,582 --> 00:20:24,551
Entire region salutes
when he appears.

195
00:20:24,752 --> 00:20:26,549
l'm that leader's niece.

196
00:20:27,755 --> 00:20:29,052
Good background.

197
00:20:29,257 --> 00:20:32,556
Would you like to hear
about my background?- Go ahead.

198
00:20:33,428 --> 00:20:36,886
Kothapeta Rowdy, Bazaar Rowdy,

199
00:20:38,433 --> 00:20:42,563
Two Town Rowdy, Assembly Rowdy,

200
00:20:43,438 --> 00:20:46,737
Rangoon Rowdy, State Rowdy,

201
00:20:48,109 --> 00:20:50,077
do you now their boss is?

202
00:20:51,779 --> 00:20:53,974
l'm right before you
and you say don't know!

203
00:20:55,283 --> 00:20:59,413
lf you go back 15 years
and see me like this.

204
00:21:06,127 --> 00:21:08,254
Why are you beating them?

205
00:21:09,297 --> 00:21:11,265
They're filthy rich brats!

206
00:21:11,466 --> 00:21:15,425
While racing on streets at night
they killed a lady by running over her.

207
00:21:15,636 --> 00:21:18,434
When asked for compensation,
they said get lost!

208
00:21:18,639 --> 00:21:20,436
So l beat them!

209
00:21:25,646 --> 00:21:28,615
Who is that girl?
Why is she so angry?

210
00:21:29,317 --> 00:21:31,615
Shravani! lsn't she beautiful?

211
00:21:31,819 --> 00:21:37,280
She bravely lodged a complaint
on me for public nuisance.

212
00:21:37,492 --> 00:21:42,122
Later on she realised and pawned
her chain to get me out on bail.

213
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:44,127
Did you meet her again?

214
00:21:44,332 --> 00:21:46,800
l met to return her chain.

215
00:21:47,001 --> 00:21:48,628
Was she happy?

216
00:21:48,836 --> 00:21:51,464
She didn't but you're very happy.

217
00:21:52,173 --> 00:21:54,038
Tell me how did she react?

218
00:21:54,509 --> 00:21:55,305
See!

219
00:21:58,513 --> 00:22:01,482
l made a mistake,
so l got you out on bail.

220
00:22:01,682 --> 00:22:03,309
Our relationship ends with that.

221
00:22:03,518 --> 00:22:04,644
Don't try to take advantage
of it to get closer,

222
00:22:04,852 --> 00:22:08,481
with friendship or
say l'm very beautiful,

223
00:22:08,689 --> 00:22:09,815
won't be nice if you follow me!

224
00:22:42,056 --> 00:22:48,859
O my girl, l've fallen flat
for your beauty...

225
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:53,689
l'll take care of you like my eyes...

226
00:22:53,901 --> 00:22:56,870

227
00:22:57,905 --> 00:23:01,705
Hello, don't over praise me...

228
00:23:01,909 --> 00:23:05,709
Don't make any plans...

229
00:23:05,913 --> 00:23:11,715
l've seen many a smart guys,
don't get smart with me...

230
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,716
Please leave me alone...

231
00:23:13,921 --> 00:23:18,051
Why are you so proud?
Cool off your anger...

232
00:23:18,259 --> 00:23:21,717
Come to me and
give me your hand...

233
00:23:21,929 --> 00:23:25,729
Your beauty is bag of sweets,
we're ants...

234
00:23:25,933 --> 00:23:28,902
How can we live away from you?

235
00:23:30,271 --> 00:23:34,071
Come my exotic bird...
My five feet flower...

236
00:23:34,275 --> 00:23:36,743
Your life would be great...

237
00:23:58,299 --> 00:24:02,099
Don't come after me,
l hate you...

238
00:24:02,303 --> 00:24:06,103
Don't irritate me...

239
00:24:06,307 --> 00:24:10,107
When l ask you to become my life,
don't say no and walk away...

240
00:24:10,311 --> 00:24:14,111
Don't slip away...

241
00:24:14,315 --> 00:24:18,115
You come in hordes and
if given an inch you take a feet...

242
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:22,119
Men are always like that...

243
00:24:22,323 --> 00:24:26,123
Given a place of needle's tip,
you hoist your flag there...

244
00:24:26,327 --> 00:24:30,286
So, l'll not come...

245
00:25:06,534 --> 00:25:08,331
Listen to me, my darling...

246
00:25:08,536 --> 00:25:14,338
Shall l put hurdles on your
way to escape from me?

247
00:25:14,542 --> 00:25:18,171
Don't trouble me...
don't spoil my heart...

248
00:25:18,379 --> 00:25:22,179
Don't stop my way...

249
00:25:22,383 --> 00:25:30,188
My heart never asked me
anything till now...

250
00:25:30,391 --> 00:25:38,025
For the first it wants you,
become mine, dear...

251
00:26:07,762 --> 00:26:11,391

l'll become your life partner...

252
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:15,228
Come what so ever it may
you're my husband...

253
00:26:15,436 --> 00:26:18,894
At last Seetha has crossed
the proverbial line...

254
00:26:19,106 --> 00:26:21,904
Watch now, l'll play the
band of happiness...

255
00:26:23,778 --> 00:26:27,236
She has opened the lovely account...
l'll be yours...

256
00:26:27,448 --> 00:26:30,246
l'll fill your life with kisses...

257
00:26:34,455 --> 00:26:38,084
Though romance is rough,
you managed to rock her.

258
00:26:38,292 --> 00:26:39,759
Are you both married?

259
00:26:41,128 --> 00:26:44,757
No, she avoided me.
- Why?

260
00:26:44,965 --> 00:26:50,597
l came to know yesterday that she's
getting treated for cancer in Vizag.

261
00:26:50,805 --> 00:26:51,601
Cancer?

262
00:26:51,806 --> 00:26:55,765
Yes, doctors have confirmed she
may not live for more than week.

263
00:26:56,977 --> 00:27:03,780
l'm going there to marry her,
let her die peacefully as my wife.

264
00:27:06,987 --> 00:27:09,285
What are you writing?
- About you.

265
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:10,354
Why?

266
00:27:10,658 --> 00:27:13,286
l shouldn't forget you in my life.

267
00:27:13,494 --> 00:27:15,462
Don't how many are there
like me in that diary?

268
00:27:16,497 --> 00:27:18,795
Two, you and my childhood friend.

269
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:20,963
ls your friend in touch with you?

270
00:27:22,169 --> 00:27:25,627
No, we got separated
while we were quite young.

271
00:27:26,173 --> 00:27:28,641
l'm feeling sleepy,
yours is upper berth.

272
00:27:41,188 --> 00:27:43,486
Excuse me...hello...

273
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:49,158
l've a small wish.
- Tell me.

274
00:27:49,363 --> 00:27:52,491
lf you don't mind,
can l attend your marriage?

275
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,328
Did you sleep well last night?

276
00:27:55,536 --> 00:27:57,834
lt was very comfortable
to travel with you.

277
00:27:58,038 --> 00:28:02,998
Since you were scared of me,
l made up a story from an old film.

278
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:04,507
You were comfortable after that.

279
00:28:19,059 --> 00:28:20,526
Who are you searching?

280
00:28:20,728 --> 00:28:23,026
Do you've to come so early?
Couldn't you come little late?

281
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:24,527
Missed a good friend.

282
00:28:24,732 --> 00:28:26,359
Who is more closer to you than me?

283
00:28:26,567 --> 00:28:30,196
l met him in train, he was
strikingly resembling my uncle.

284
00:28:30,404 --> 00:28:34,204
My sixth sense says he's my uncle's
son who went missing as a little boy.

285
00:28:34,408 --> 00:28:37,377
Have you started narrating the
same old boring tale again?

286
00:28:37,578 --> 00:28:42,379
ls my family's 25 year yearning for
missing son a boring tale to you?

287
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:45,381
Our friendship ends here,
l'm going back to my place.

288
00:28:45,586 --> 00:28:47,213
Stop Deepu !

289
00:29:25,459 --> 00:29:26,255
Start the car!

290
00:29:52,486 --> 00:29:54,454
Go...go...

291
00:31:01,889 --> 00:31:05,017
How to reach Errada?
- Errada? Why?

292
00:31:05,225 --> 00:31:06,192
l've work there.

293
00:31:06,393 --> 00:31:08,190
lf you've work thee,
why did you come down from up?

294
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,526
lt won't land anywhere
other than water.

295
00:31:14,735 --> 00:31:16,202
Where are you coming from?

296
00:31:16,403 --> 00:31:18,030
From Mars planet.

297
00:31:18,238 --> 00:31:20,206
Can you come this far in a Qualis car?

298
00:31:20,407 --> 00:31:22,875
lt's not a car but spaceship.

299
00:31:24,244 --> 00:31:25,040
l mean you are...?

300
00:31:25,245 --> 00:31:27,873
Alien from another planet.

301
00:31:28,582 --> 00:31:30,049
Can you guide me to Errada?

302
00:31:40,427 --> 00:31:43,055
They say there are 7 people
in the world who look similar.

303
00:31:43,263 --> 00:31:46,391
How to find your train friend
is really your uncle's son?

304
00:31:47,101 --> 00:31:51,060
People of Rayalaseema
adored my grandfather.

305
00:31:51,271 --> 00:31:53,899
Even such a great man had enemies.

306
00:31:55,776 --> 00:32:02,409
My grandpa was shot while talking to
my uncle's son who was two then.

307
00:32:03,283 --> 00:32:07,913
The bullet hit my uncle's son
and luckily both were saved.

308
00:32:08,789 --> 00:32:11,087
lf he has that bullet mark,

309
00:32:11,291 --> 00:32:14,590
l can be sure train mate
was indeed uncle's son.

310
00:32:14,795 --> 00:32:16,422
Where did the bullet him?

311
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,928
Exactly here...

312
00:32:19,466 --> 00:32:22,264
Very complicated place, right?
How can we see it?

313
00:32:22,469 --> 00:32:25,097
We must first out
where is he staying here?

314
00:32:25,305 --> 00:32:28,274
Then, let's think about that.
How to see the mark?

315
00:32:31,812 --> 00:32:32,608
Who are you?

316
00:32:32,813 --> 00:32:35,111
Didn't you recognise me?
- l'm Bobby!

317
00:32:35,315 --> 00:32:37,613
Bobby? Who?

318
00:32:37,818 --> 00:32:40,116
Your daughter's class mate in school.

319
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,947
ls it you Bobby?

320
00:32:42,156 --> 00:32:44,624
Karuna, Deepu...come here!

321
00:32:52,332 --> 00:32:53,299
Why are you look surprised?

322
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,799
Your childhood friend,
who wounded your father's head,

323
00:32:57,337 --> 00:32:58,964
do you remember? He's Bobby.

324
00:32:59,173 --> 00:33:02,142
Are you Bobby?
- Yes, you..?

325
00:33:02,342 --> 00:33:03,468
Didn't you recognise me?

326
00:33:03,677 --> 00:33:05,975
l'm Deepu, she's Karuna.

327
00:33:06,513 --> 00:33:09,141
l've written twice about you
in my diary.

328
00:33:09,349 --> 00:33:11,374
ln our childhood days
and last night in train.

329
00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:12,815
Both are same!

330
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:15,648
How did you get the address
after so many years?

331
00:33:15,856 --> 00:33:17,983
l saw in the diary.
- Diary?

332
00:33:18,859 --> 00:33:20,827
l mean l saw in the daily newspaper.

333
00:33:21,028 --> 00:33:22,996
Read about Karuna getting
first rank in Civil exams,

334
00:33:23,197 --> 00:33:25,495
her compete details were
given including her surname.

335
00:33:25,699 --> 00:33:28,327
l found the way to your
home in Errada.

336
00:33:28,535 --> 00:33:31,003
Hasn't Brahmam become normal yet?

337
00:33:31,205 --> 00:33:34,174
He was given shock treatment
for 6 years to get normal.

338
00:33:34,374 --> 00:33:36,842
Where is he now?
- He's coming!

339
00:33:37,044 --> 00:33:38,841
You've a long life, dear!

340
00:33:49,122 --> 00:33:51,420
Why are you staring at him?
Didn't you recognise him?

341
00:33:51,959 --> 00:33:53,426
Our daughter's class mate Bobby.

342
00:33:53,627 --> 00:33:55,754
Show the room to him,
he'll freshen up.

343
00:33:55,963 --> 00:33:57,760
l'll get him a coffee.

344
00:34:38,272 --> 00:34:44,802
Even in these tense moments
a doubt is bothering you, right?

345
00:34:45,612 --> 00:34:46,408
How do you know it?

346
00:34:46,613 --> 00:34:50,242
We're 3000 crore years ahead
of you humans.

347
00:34:51,451 --> 00:34:55,410
We aliens know what's in your mind!

348
00:34:55,622 --> 00:34:57,920
Tell me what's my doubt?

349
00:34:58,125 --> 00:35:02,425
How could a Marsian like me
befriend your daughter on earth?

350
00:35:02,629 --> 00:35:03,596
lsn't that your doubt?

351
00:35:04,131 --> 00:35:05,928
Ours is middle class family in Mars.

352
00:35:07,968 --> 00:35:09,765
Do you also have middle class families?

353
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:11,437
There's no planet without them.

354
00:35:11,638 --> 00:35:16,268
Can't buy a tea there even if Ambanis
sell their entire property!

355
00:35:16,476 --> 00:35:19,445
lf they want to?
- Have to beg at signals!

356
00:35:19,646 --> 00:35:23,776
Since they take less donation,
my father sent me to St.Mary school here.

357
00:35:23,984 --> 00:35:25,781
Like that Karuna became my friend.

358
00:35:25,986 --> 00:35:27,613
Do they also know you're an alien?

359
00:35:27,821 --> 00:35:29,846
l didn't tell them fearing
friendship may get snapped.

360
00:35:30,991 --> 00:35:31,958
You too don't tell them.

361
00:35:33,493 --> 00:35:35,290
Were you staying in St.Mary hostel?

362
00:35:35,495 --> 00:35:38,293
No, l used to come from
Mars every day.

363
00:35:38,498 --> 00:35:42,298
ls it shuttle service between
Vijayawada-Guntur via Mangalagiri?

364
00:35:42,502 --> 00:35:44,129
You saw how l landed just now!

365
00:35:44,338 --> 00:35:45,635
l used to come every day like that.

366
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:49,297
Won't books get wet
if you land in water?- No.

367
00:35:49,509 --> 00:35:52,535
But you got wet, right?
- Battery got discharged.

368
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,648
l've to change, please go out.

369
00:35:55,849 --> 00:35:57,976
You're a machine, right?
Change, l'll stay here.

370
00:35:58,185 --> 00:36:02,144
l've lot of spare parts in body like
aerials, receivers and antennas!

371
00:36:02,356 --> 00:36:06,816
lf l undress before you,
ultraviolet rays will make you blind.

372
00:36:09,863 --> 00:36:11,228
ls your doubt cleared?

373
00:36:11,531 --> 00:36:16,332
That doubt is cleared but the doubt
of what would happen to me remains!

374
00:36:16,536 --> 00:36:17,833
What would happen to me?

375
00:36:27,881 --> 00:36:28,506
What?

376
00:36:28,715 --> 00:36:30,512
Taps are jammed here and gone dry.

377
00:36:30,717 --> 00:36:31,684
Use the other bathroom.

378
00:36:31,885 --> 00:36:33,182
Where?
- There!

379
00:36:38,058 --> 00:36:40,686
l'm tensed.
- Why?

380
00:36:40,894 --> 00:36:42,191
We're going to see only the mark, right?

381
00:37:12,426 --> 00:37:16,385
Vigor of youth is splendid...
Crossed the limits a little...

382
00:37:16,596 --> 00:37:21,898
Suddenly hit by an unknown desire...

383
00:37:23,437 --> 00:37:27,396
Magical intoxicating swan...
fixed auspicious time for kiss...

384
00:37:27,607 --> 00:37:34,240
Vanished the distance between us...

385
00:37:34,448 --> 00:37:38,578
Come like parrot to taste this fruit...

386
00:37:38,785 --> 00:37:42,585
l'm inviting to celebrate love...

387
00:37:42,789 --> 00:37:46,748
Give me something...
take something from me...

388
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:53,991
ln this chill weather...
have fun with me...

389
00:38:39,012 --> 00:38:42,971
A mound of desires...
a rush to have it all...

390
00:38:43,183 --> 00:38:49,645
Do you want to enjoy
the fun of love?

391
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:53,815
Hit by passions...l'm melting...

392
00:38:54,027 --> 00:38:59,659
Why don't you come to quench
my thirst of love?

393
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:50,710
You came and started the
festival of love...

394
00:39:50,917 --> 00:39:57,220
An unquenched desire
brought me to you...

395
00:39:57,424 --> 00:40:07,459
l found the man in you,
l want you to leave your mark on me...

396
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,086
Open the door.

397
00:40:39,799 --> 00:40:42,597
Why are you in this condition?
Did you see the mark?

398
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:44,437
No.

399
00:40:44,638 --> 00:40:46,765
What did you do without
seeing the mark?

400
00:40:47,307 --> 00:40:51,107
Generally people take bath
facing shower,

401
00:40:51,811 --> 00:40:55,269
but Bobby took bath facing the door!

402
00:41:25,845 --> 00:41:27,813
Don't know where's the water bottle?

403
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:33,318
Daddy is coming here for water,
let's go.

404
00:41:41,361 --> 00:41:43,329
He's listening to news
in Mars to sleep.

405
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:46,658
This evidence is enough for
my wife to believe he's an alien.

406
00:42:00,714 --> 00:42:01,339
Where are you taking at this hour?

407
00:42:01,548 --> 00:42:02,674
You didn't believe me, right?

408
00:42:02,882 --> 00:42:05,350
Look at that wire,
he's sleeping listening to news.

409
00:42:05,552 --> 00:42:06,678
He's an alien.

410
00:42:06,886 --> 00:42:08,854
lf you've doubt,
you too listen to it.

411
00:42:09,055 --> 00:42:11,182
You can listen news.
Come on !

412
00:42:24,571 --> 00:42:29,031
Mother...mother...

413
00:42:54,267 --> 00:42:57,395
l'll not leave you alone!
You've gone mad again.

414
00:42:59,773 --> 00:43:03,573
shock? Stay here till we go to
hospital tomorrow.

415
00:43:03,777 --> 00:43:07,076
l think you'd kill me
with your madness.

416
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,747
Please don't feel for him,
go to bed.

417
00:43:08,948 --> 00:43:12,247
Come, let him rot there.
My fate!

418
00:43:14,954 --> 00:43:17,422
When l held the wire
l didn't get the shock,

419
00:43:17,624 --> 00:43:19,751
but how come wife got
the shock of her life?

420
00:43:19,959 --> 00:43:21,756
Power cut in Mars then !

421
00:43:24,464 --> 00:43:26,091
Power cut in Mars?

422
00:44:24,524 --> 00:44:26,492
How could he survive such a great fall?

423
00:44:26,693 --> 00:44:28,490
l'm also confused.

424
00:44:38,538 --> 00:44:40,836
Why are you shocked on seeing him?

425
00:44:41,207 --> 00:44:44,665
Do you know him?
Who is he?

426
00:44:46,212 --> 00:44:47,179
Alien?

427
00:44:56,556 --> 00:45:00,856
You can get surprised later,
first tell who you all are!

428
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:02,357
Terminators!

429
00:45:10,236 --> 00:45:11,203
Where is he?

430
00:46:06,292 --> 00:46:09,090
What are you breaking there?
l'm fed up with your madness!

431
00:46:09,295 --> 00:46:12,822
You've latched the door, open it!
Calling you !

432
00:46:13,967 --> 00:46:17,835
Come get going quickly...go...go...

433
00:46:19,639 --> 00:46:20,606
Go...

434
00:46:31,985 --> 00:46:32,781
What?

435
00:46:44,163 --> 00:46:46,131
ls your job done?

436
00:46:46,332 --> 00:46:49,631
Hang on the line,
l'll finish it in a moment!

437
00:46:58,344 --> 00:46:59,140
What was that noise?

438
00:46:59,345 --> 00:47:01,142
Lord of Death's noise!

439
00:47:01,347 --> 00:47:02,143
Who are you?

440
00:47:02,348 --> 00:47:03,975
lf you think
you'll shudder to death !

441
00:47:04,183 --> 00:47:06,151
lf you see me,
you'll shiver to death !

442
00:47:07,186 --> 00:47:09,984
Send anyone or you come personally!

443
00:47:10,523 --> 00:47:15,324
The vehicle is on high octane,
it'll run over you !

444
00:47:16,362 --> 00:47:19,331
Did they kidnap the girl?
- No.

445
00:47:19,699 --> 00:47:23,328
Other we three, a fourth person
knows about this plan.

446
00:47:24,203 --> 00:47:26,831
l know who that fourth man is!

447
00:47:28,041 --> 00:47:33,001
He could save the girl but
can't tell this plan to anyone.

448
00:47:33,212 --> 00:47:36,010
Arrange to get me out of jail.

449
00:47:37,216 --> 00:47:40,515
Death anniversary of
Ramakrishna Prasad's father!

450
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:45,521
lf we attend it,
we'll be positive among the masses.

451
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:49,357
Even if he dies,
people won't suspect us.

452
00:47:51,731 --> 00:47:55,030
Please open the door!
What's that noise?

453
00:47:56,235 --> 00:47:57,702
Open the door!

454
00:47:58,905 --> 00:48:02,363
Can't you hear me?
What are you doing?

455
00:48:03,076 --> 00:48:04,373
l'm calling you, hubby!

456
00:48:05,745 --> 00:48:06,871
Open the door!

457
00:48:16,923 --> 00:48:17,890
Thanks.

458
00:48:19,258 --> 00:48:21,226
Hold this!
- Why?

459
00:48:21,427 --> 00:48:26,057
To save yourself from fits and
paralysis in the next scene.

460
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:55,420
l think you won't get better
unless l take you to shock room!

461
00:48:55,628 --> 00:48:58,927
No need to put him through
shocks at this age.

462
00:48:59,132 --> 00:49:02,101
He must get shock treatment
at any age!

463
00:49:02,301 --> 00:49:05,270
There's a nature cure centre here,
he'll get better there.

464
00:49:05,471 --> 00:49:07,996
Get better? lt's my damn fate!

465
00:49:16,482 --> 00:49:17,608
No need!

466
00:49:30,663 --> 00:49:32,290
Alien?

467
00:49:32,498 --> 00:49:34,295
Studying with humans,

468
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:37,958
coming to Vizag from Mars
for a friend,

469
00:49:38,171 --> 00:49:42,130
l feel like laughing at you,
its unbelievable, son !

470
00:49:42,341 --> 00:49:46,141
People can't go from one world
to another world with this body!

471
00:49:46,345 --> 00:49:48,313
You made a mistake there, Swami!

472
00:49:48,514 --> 00:49:52,314
They've latest vehicles
that can go to any place!

473
00:49:52,518 --> 00:49:56,318
No vehicle can travel
like mind, right Swami?

474
00:49:56,522 --> 00:49:58,149
You're right!

475
00:49:58,357 --> 00:50:02,316
lf mind is in control,
he can win over it.

476
00:50:02,528 --> 00:50:03,995
What do you mean by it?

477
00:50:04,197 --> 00:50:08,657
The way you behave is known
as madness.

478
00:50:08,868 --> 00:50:10,665
You got that opportunity!

479
00:50:11,537 --> 00:50:14,335
Can you cure him, Swami?

480
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:17,839
Meditation therapy can bring
him back to this world.

481
00:50:18,044 --> 00:50:21,502
Meditation therapy? l thought
you'd give me shock therapy.

482
00:50:21,714 --> 00:50:25,172
Do whatever you may, truth can't
become false or vice versa!

483
00:50:25,384 --> 00:50:26,681
Where's meditation therapy?
Come, let's go.

484
00:50:26,886 --> 00:50:31,186
Stop, not that side,
you've to enter this!

485
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:34,518
Enter this?
How can l enter this?

486
00:50:34,727 --> 00:50:38,026
lt'll be difficult for him.
Please help him!

487
00:50:38,231 --> 00:50:42,031
ls it bank loan with
low interest to help?

488
00:50:42,235 --> 00:50:43,532
You're asking them to help me.

489
00:50:43,736 --> 00:50:44,703
How can l sit in it?

490
00:50:44,904 --> 00:50:47,873
l would die without air!
Why don't you tell him?- Go!

491
00:50:48,074 --> 00:50:51,043
Every patient says the same
thing before entering it.

492
00:50:51,244 --> 00:50:53,212
Put that mad man into it.

493
00:50:56,449 --> 00:50:58,417
l'm unable to breath, open it!

494
00:50:58,618 --> 00:51:02,076
He'll raise hell and then cool off
to become a normal man again.

495
00:51:02,421 --> 00:51:04,048
Nothing to worry.

496
00:51:53,806 --> 00:51:55,103
Thanks dear!

497
00:51:55,975 --> 00:51:59,433
lf you cheat a handicapped man,
you won't get even a banana!

498
00:51:59,645 --> 00:52:02,773
lf so l'll manage with hand.

499
00:52:04,483 --> 00:52:06,280
Are you physically challenged man?

500
00:52:08,487 --> 00:52:11,945
Your limbs are normal!

501
00:52:12,992 --> 00:52:14,459
l've seen your talent.

502
00:52:15,161 --> 00:52:20,622
lf l tell people here, you'd
spend rest of your life here.

503
00:52:20,833 --> 00:52:24,291
Please don't tell anyone,
let's share it 50-50!

504
00:52:24,503 --> 00:52:25,970
l don't want partnership in this.

505
00:52:26,839 --> 00:52:29,467
But you must cut the back
of a man and show me!- Back?

506
00:52:30,176 --> 00:52:32,144
l'll return the purse then.

507
00:52:32,345 --> 00:52:33,812
Where exactly the location is!

508
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,477
Keep you left on your back!

509
00:52:39,018 --> 00:52:40,986
Whose has such a great background?

510
00:52:48,527 --> 00:52:49,494
How do you feel now?

511
00:52:49,695 --> 00:52:54,496
lt was different earlier
but now l'm peaceful.

512
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:57,168
ls he completely cured?

513
00:52:57,370 --> 00:52:59,838
He may be better now,

514
00:53:00,039 --> 00:53:03,497
if there's
any change in his behaviour,

515
00:53:03,709 --> 00:53:05,836
he may need meditation therapy again.

516
00:53:06,045 --> 00:53:09,173
For safer side, l'll observe
him for 2 days.- Okay.

517
00:53:09,382 --> 00:53:11,009
You're right, Swami.

518
00:53:11,217 --> 00:53:14,186
l'll have a coffee.
- Go.

519
00:53:14,387 --> 00:53:17,185
My body is aching!
- Come.

520
00:53:20,393 --> 00:53:21,189
That man !

521
00:53:28,234 --> 00:53:29,861
Cut would be great!

522
00:53:48,087 --> 00:53:49,384
Your taste is too bad!

523
00:53:49,588 --> 00:53:52,216
l didn't tell about that man,
the man next to him!

524
00:53:52,925 --> 00:53:54,893
Your taste is rocking!

525
00:53:57,763 --> 00:53:59,560
Why are you so tensed?

526
00:53:59,765 --> 00:54:01,892
Aunty, there...

527
00:54:09,275 --> 00:54:10,242
What?

528
00:54:10,443 --> 00:54:12,911
Save me, Bobby!

529
00:54:22,621 --> 00:54:23,417
What's that?

530
00:54:23,622 --> 00:54:25,419
Can't you see? Blade!

531
00:54:25,624 --> 00:54:26,750
What do you do with it?

532
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:34,263
Can tonsure heads, shave
and commit suicide too!

533
00:54:34,467 --> 00:54:35,263
That's all?

534
00:54:37,636 --> 00:54:41,265
lf you trouble more than that
blade will break!

535
00:54:49,648 --> 00:54:52,276
l put so much pressure
but it didn't break!

536
00:54:52,485 --> 00:54:55,784
lt's your hand power not the blade!

537
00:54:55,988 --> 00:55:00,118
Use to shave or cut,
if you use it like me,

538
00:55:00,326 --> 00:55:03,295
next time you'd be dead
instead of tattered!

539
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:15,306
You said you'd rip him!

540
00:55:16,175 --> 00:55:20,305
Thank God, my blade didn't
touch his clothes!

541
00:55:20,513 --> 00:55:24,813
l would've been shred to
pieces by the entire state!

542
00:55:25,518 --> 00:55:29,648
l don't know if l've all
my body parts intact!

543
00:55:29,855 --> 00:55:34,155
lf you give the purse l'll
have it scanned in hospital.

544
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:40,492
l didn't want lndian tourism to
get affected by people like you,

545
00:55:40,699 --> 00:55:42,997
l've returned the purse
to the foreigner.

546
00:55:45,538 --> 00:55:46,402
Bye!

547
00:55:55,714 --> 00:55:57,841
Why are you so dull?

548
00:55:58,050 --> 00:56:00,518
Can't an idea to see that mark?

549
00:56:00,719 --> 00:56:03,017
Try this herbal mixture.
- What's this?

550
00:56:03,222 --> 00:56:07,022
A man was shouting unable to
bear the pain of the treatment.

551
00:56:07,226 --> 00:56:10,024
He fell unconscious on smelling
this herbal mixture.

552
00:56:40,926 --> 00:56:44,555
Come here my hero, my man...

553
00:56:44,763 --> 00:56:48,893
l'm burning with desires...

554
00:56:49,101 --> 00:56:52,730
Hey you sweety,
you waist is rocking...

555
00:56:52,938 --> 00:56:57,068
Your beauty is devastating...

556
00:57:01,447 --> 00:57:04,814
This is a cesspool of trouble,
l'll not get into it...

557
00:57:08,621 --> 00:57:11,749
lf you give me little space,
l'll occupy and never leave it...

558
00:57:40,486 --> 00:57:48,450
You're alluring and
l'm itching to have you...

559
00:57:48,661 --> 00:57:56,625
l'm inviting like standing crop,
harvest me...

560
00:57:56,835 --> 00:58:00,635
l can't hold anymore,
l can't stop myself anymore...

561
00:58:00,839 --> 00:58:04,969
May l hunt you like a tiger...

562
00:58:05,177 --> 00:58:08,977
lt has begun,
what are you still waiting for?

563
00:58:09,181 --> 00:58:13,140
Burn down the forest
with your fire of passion...

564
00:58:13,352 --> 00:58:17,152
Don't make me go mad with
your sensational waist...

565
00:58:17,356 --> 00:58:21,156
Don't put me on tenterhooks
with your manliness...

566
00:58:21,527 --> 00:58:24,155
Don't challenge me
with your youth...

567
00:58:24,363 --> 00:58:27,992
Don't smoke my heart
with your incense...

568
00:58:44,049 --> 00:58:52,013
Your youth is rushing and gushing
like river Godavari in spate...

569
00:58:52,224 --> 00:59:00,359
lt wishes you to embrace me
like a windstorm...

570
00:59:00,566 --> 00:59:04,525
You're a bag of beauty
and trouble...

571
00:59:04,737 --> 00:59:08,537
May l take to task your
youthful bounties...

572
00:59:08,741 --> 00:59:12,541
lt's green signal,
let the fun rock...

573
00:59:12,745 --> 00:59:16,704
Take on and devastate me...

574
00:59:16,915 --> 00:59:20,715
lf you invite with your beauty,
its trouble...

575
00:59:20,919 --> 00:59:24,878
Your manliness has got
the right partner...

576
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:27,718
The fun began in the hut...
in chilly twilight...

577
00:59:27,926 --> 00:59:31,623
One wet sand...
with you...

578
00:59:42,775 --> 00:59:44,572
Will you accept now that
he's my uncle's son?

579
00:59:46,779 --> 00:59:47,404
Are you both here?

580
00:59:47,613 --> 00:59:48,910
We don't get signals her,

581
00:59:49,114 --> 00:59:51,241
your uncle
has been trying to reach you.

582
00:59:51,450 --> 00:59:53,077
Today is your grandpa's
death anniversary, right?

583
00:59:53,285 --> 00:59:54,752
l forgot it.

584
00:59:54,953 --> 00:59:56,921
Where can l get signal?
- That side.

585
00:59:57,956 --> 00:59:58,752
Mad girl!

586
01:00:23,148 --> 01:00:26,276
lt's anniversary of a great man,
people like you're not allowed here.

587
01:00:26,485 --> 01:00:28,112
Go away!

588
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:29,446
They won't listen to words!

589
01:00:44,670 --> 01:00:47,798
Show it to people and
immerse in river.

590
01:01:31,216 --> 01:01:34,515
l can't, you tell him
why we are here!

591
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,018
He won't believe me, you tell him.

592
01:01:40,726 --> 01:01:50,192
l'm here to tell personally news
that may cheer up you and your people.

593
01:01:50,736 --> 01:01:54,866
Your father Harishchandra Prasad
brought an end to factionism,

594
01:01:55,073 --> 01:01:56,870
made people to take up jobs,

595
01:01:57,075 --> 01:02:01,034
and became a great man who lives
in the hearts of the people here!

596
01:02:01,914 --> 01:02:05,714
15 years have passed since he died.

597
01:02:05,918 --> 01:02:14,053
With an intention to make him for
live in the hearts of people forever,

598
01:02:14,259 --> 01:02:18,059
in the heart of Kurnool city,
on a 10 acre plot,

599
01:02:18,263 --> 01:02:25,066
my government has decided
to install a 72 feet statue!

600
01:02:26,438 --> 01:02:29,066
Sir, l think you didn't get me.

601
01:02:29,274 --> 01:02:33,904
72 feet tall statue on a 10 acre plot!

602
01:02:34,112 --> 01:02:36,080
One of it's kind in lndia!

603
01:02:36,448 --> 01:02:40,077
lt's not 10 acres but 32 acres!

604
01:02:40,285 --> 01:02:44,745
8000 families are living
there putting up huts!

605
01:02:45,457 --> 01:02:50,918
To usurp their land if you lure
with parks or statues,

606
01:02:51,129 --> 01:02:52,926
and dare to remove even one hut,

607
01:02:53,131 --> 01:02:57,261
l'll see that your body won't get
even an inch of land to get buried!

608
01:02:58,470 --> 01:03:03,271
People themselves have installed
statues of my father,

609
01:03:03,475 --> 01:03:06,103
we don't your Govt. to install
any new statues.

610
01:03:06,478 --> 01:03:10,778
Good leader must live in the hearts
not on roads as statues!

611
01:03:11,650 --> 01:03:15,279
Will you tell why you're playing
this statue politics,

612
01:03:15,487 --> 01:03:16,852
or shall l tell that myself!

613
01:03:17,322 --> 01:03:21,122
Matter is that, it wasn't his plan !

614
01:03:21,326 --> 01:03:23,624
Party high command planned
to impress you with this,

615
01:03:23,829 --> 01:03:26,525
and invite you to join the party,

616
01:03:27,332 --> 01:03:31,792
your candidates are winning here
for the past 25 years,

617
01:03:32,671 --> 01:03:35,469
if you support their party this time,

618
01:03:35,674 --> 01:03:39,678
party high command is ready
to offer you any powerful position !

619
01:03:39,678 --> 01:03:41,976
Position to me?

620
01:03:43,181 --> 01:03:44,978
lt is not an award!

621
01:03:45,350 --> 01:03:48,148
To accept when someone offers it!

622
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:51,518
lt's a responsibility given
by people to the leader!

623
01:03:52,224 --> 01:03:59,027
Man who stands by people and
stands by them through thick and thin,

624
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:00,528
he's the real leader!

625
01:04:00,866 --> 01:04:03,835
When position comes seeking him,

626
01:04:04,036 --> 01:04:07,005
even if he says no,
it'll chase him!

627
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:11,999
He's not a leader who falls
for the bait of position !

628
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:15,179
There are many out there,
find one yourself!

629
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:16,847
You and your party high command!

630
01:04:17,049 --> 01:04:19,517
Do you know the power of my high command?

631
01:04:19,718 --> 01:04:22,016
Taking sides of these
brainless people...

632
01:04:23,722 --> 01:04:28,182
lf you raise your voice when l'm
talking or use filthy language...

633
01:04:38,737 --> 01:04:40,364
Sir, phone for you !

634
01:04:44,409 --> 01:04:45,205
Who is it?

635
01:04:45,410 --> 01:04:49,210
You've forgotten your enemy,
it means you're living happily!

636
01:04:49,414 --> 01:04:51,609
Your bad time starts now!

637
01:04:52,084 --> 01:04:54,712
l'll not spare anyone in your family!

638
01:04:55,087 --> 01:04:57,555
Your niece is in my custody!

639
01:04:57,756 --> 01:05:00,384
l'll ruin her honour in hours!

640
01:05:00,592 --> 01:05:03,220
At least try to save her life!

641
01:05:03,428 --> 01:05:07,728
Come alone to Vizag!
l'll wait for you !

642
01:05:24,783 --> 01:05:26,751
l think you know who l'm now!

643
01:05:26,952 --> 01:05:29,420
l would've killed before you woke up.

644
01:05:29,788 --> 01:05:34,418
lt seems you ask the details
before killing anyone.

645
01:05:35,961 --> 01:05:42,662
lt's my style to tell details
of me before killing anyone.

646
01:05:44,136 --> 01:05:48,436
You saved her life twice!
Save her now!

647
01:05:49,808 --> 01:05:52,106
You're son of Rayalaseema tiger!

648
01:05:52,978 --> 01:05:54,605
Why don't you take a step?

649
01:06:05,991 --> 01:06:09,119
Your father raised her fondly!

650
01:06:09,327 --> 01:06:12,956
l'll rape her as you watch !

651
01:06:13,331 --> 01:06:18,462
You'd die in anger
unable to do anything!

652
01:06:28,513 --> 01:06:29,309
Stop!

653
01:06:39,858 --> 01:06:40,984
Stop!

654
01:07:07,219 --> 01:07:08,846
Gun him down boys!

655
01:07:30,575 --> 01:07:31,872
lt's empty!

656
01:08:03,942 --> 01:08:06,740
You'd die with one swipe!

657
01:08:06,945 --> 01:08:09,243
You must live and see the hell!

658
01:08:09,447 --> 01:08:12,473
They you'll beg for death !

659
01:10:10,235 --> 01:10:11,361
You asked me to come alone!

660
01:10:12,237 --> 01:10:15,536
Just one hit and you're gone!

661
01:10:16,241 --> 01:10:19,870
To call yourself as my enemy,
you need status!

662
01:10:35,093 --> 01:10:36,390
Where is Deepthi?

663
01:10:39,264 --> 01:10:41,892
She's unconscious getting hurt, father!

664
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:45,228
l'll rip your tongue!
Who is your father?

665
01:10:45,437 --> 01:10:46,563
l know the truth !

666
01:10:46,771 --> 01:10:48,068
Then you should've known the wrong also!

667
01:10:48,273 --> 01:10:49,399
l know, that's why l'm here.

668
01:10:49,607 --> 01:10:52,405
l know you're here for my legacy!

669
01:10:52,610 --> 01:10:54,737
Even if you become Valmiki,
you'll not get it.

670
01:10:54,946 --> 01:10:56,243
l'm that ambitious!

671
01:10:57,115 --> 01:10:58,412
l'm here to protect my family.

672
01:10:58,616 --> 01:11:01,244
That's what l've been doing
before you were born.

673
01:11:10,462 --> 01:11:14,592
Go anywhere in this world,
have relationship with anyone,

674
01:11:15,133 --> 01:11:19,593
if you try to join my family,
l'll kill you !

675
01:11:26,952 --> 01:11:28,788
What are you saying, Swami?

676
01:11:28,788 --> 01:11:30,415
Was there a battle here
2 hours earlier?

677
01:11:30,623 --> 01:11:33,091
ls this Pakistan or Kirghizstan?

678
01:11:33,292 --> 01:11:37,422
lf anyone hears this, you'd enter
this box and l'd be sitting there.

679
01:11:37,630 --> 01:11:39,257
Did you see how he's talking?

680
01:11:39,465 --> 01:11:41,262
Says he'll put you into the box.

681
01:11:41,467 --> 01:11:46,427
Swami, keep him in box for
at least 10 days till he's normal.

682
01:11:46,639 --> 01:11:48,266
10 days in this box?

683
01:11:48,474 --> 01:11:51,602
Come with me, let's be here
for next 10 generations.

684
01:11:51,811 --> 01:11:53,108
What nonsense are you saying, father?

685
01:11:53,312 --> 01:11:54,279
Do you know who Bobby is?

686
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:56,277
He's Deepu's uncle's son
who went missing as a kid.

687
01:11:56,482 --> 01:11:58,279
Deepu's uncle's son?

688
01:11:59,485 --> 01:12:00,452
Where is he now?

689
01:12:00,653 --> 01:12:05,113
Missing since that fight.
- Are you mad or me?

690
01:12:05,324 --> 01:12:07,622
ls this cosmopolitan city
to go missing?

691
01:12:07,827 --> 01:12:10,125
lt's hardly the size of a loin !

692
01:12:10,329 --> 01:12:13,787
My legs are paining after
continuous meditation,

693
01:12:13,999 --> 01:12:15,626
l'll go a little stroll.

694
01:12:15,835 --> 01:12:19,464
lf there's any problem,
l'll come back.

695
01:12:20,506 --> 01:12:23,634
Like God took 10 incarnations
to save this world,

696
01:12:24,009 --> 01:12:26,307
don't know how incarnations
this alien would take?

697
01:12:26,512 --> 01:12:28,980
l'm sure to go mad!

698
01:12:36,689 --> 01:12:38,816
Even in this tension,
you've a doubt, right?

699
01:12:39,024 --> 01:12:43,154
You doubt how could l become
Rayalaseema leader's son, right?

700
01:12:44,029 --> 01:12:46,554
l'm not an alien, l'm a human !

701
01:12:47,366 --> 01:12:49,334
Why did you come down from up?

702
01:12:50,035 --> 01:12:52,333
Few people kidnapped me
from a temple festival,

703
01:12:52,538 --> 01:12:54,165
and sold me off to American scientists,

704
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:57,508
to test if humans can live
on Mars or not,

705
01:12:57,710 --> 01:12:59,837
they sent me to Mars in a rocket,

706
01:13:00,045 --> 01:13:03,674
l was found by few aliens,
they raised me!

707
01:13:03,883 --> 01:13:05,851
My bad fate, you came here!

708
01:13:07,219 --> 01:13:11,349
Yesterday l came to know l'm Ramakrishna
Prasad's son and not an alien.

709
01:13:11,557 --> 01:13:13,354
l went to Mars to know the truth.

710
01:13:13,559 --> 01:13:15,186
lt took little time to reach earth.

711
01:13:15,394 --> 01:13:17,362
Tell me my parents' address
in Rayalaseema,

712
01:13:17,563 --> 01:13:19,190
l'll give whatever you ask!

713
01:13:20,065 --> 01:13:21,862
Will you give whatever l ask?

714
01:13:22,067 --> 01:13:25,366
l lost my balance getting beaten
by you and my job too!

715
01:13:25,571 --> 01:13:27,869
Give me Rs.1 crore!
My wife would respect me!

716
01:13:28,073 --> 01:13:29,540
She'll revere me with flowers!

717
01:13:29,742 --> 01:13:32,540
Shall l give the cheque here
or cash there?

718
01:13:32,745 --> 01:13:34,372
Give the cash there!

719
01:13:37,416 --> 01:13:39,884
They're children of Ministers
of the ruling party!

720
01:13:41,587 --> 01:13:45,546
You all are software engineers!
lsn't it?

721
01:13:47,885 --> 01:13:51,844
One of you four would die surely
if you go to the court,

722
01:13:53,224 --> 01:13:58,184
other three would accept
to register meekly, why?

723
01:13:59,230 --> 01:14:02,028
You all are paid high by
the software companies,

724
01:14:02,233 --> 01:14:05,361
keep your money in fixed deposits
in banks on your children !

725
01:14:06,570 --> 01:14:09,698
How could you people without
any background invest in land,

726
01:14:09,907 --> 01:14:11,875
would they keep quiet
without occupying your lands?

727
01:14:13,244 --> 01:14:16,213
We know you're supporting
corruption and threatening us!

728
01:14:16,413 --> 01:14:21,373
But our leader sent us to face you
bravely without fear with our education !

729
01:14:27,591 --> 01:14:28,558
What education?

730
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:32,888
Can you use knives, daggers or gun?

731
01:14:33,097 --> 01:14:36,066
They're well trained in this!
Tell them!

732
01:15:08,465 --> 01:15:10,433
Please go away from here, sir!

733
01:15:10,634 --> 01:15:13,603
lf a leader like you creates
trouble before DGP's office,

734
01:15:13,804 --> 01:15:15,431
people wouldn't trust police anymore.

735
01:15:15,639 --> 01:15:16,435
Please go away!

736
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:21,270
Would people trust you more if you
run kangaroo courts inside DGP's office?

737
01:15:25,649 --> 01:15:27,276
You're holding a responsible position !

738
01:15:27,484 --> 01:15:29,850
Never do anything again to
hang your head in shame!

739
01:15:30,487 --> 01:15:34,787
Tell them to say sorry and
leave the occupied land!

740
01:15:36,827 --> 01:15:39,625
Should we say sorry to these
salaried class people?

741
01:15:39,830 --> 01:15:42,799
Government is in our hands,
law and order is in your hands,

742
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,968
why are you afraid of
this powerless man?

743
01:15:48,005 --> 01:15:49,973
Why did you come in between?
l'm talking to him, right?

744
01:15:50,174 --> 01:15:52,142
Sir, please leave him.

745
01:15:52,343 --> 01:15:54,641
lf anything happens to him,
l may be forced to take action !

746
01:15:54,845 --> 01:15:55,971
What are you waiting for?
Take action !

747
01:15:56,180 --> 01:16:00,480
You can't get a better
chance to kill me!

748
01:16:00,684 --> 01:16:03,551
For you and the politicians
behind you !

749
01:16:04,855 --> 01:16:06,322
l'm telling you to leave him.

750
01:16:07,358 --> 01:16:09,155
lf not l'll fire at you !

751
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:12,488
You've the power and
you've a gun too!

752
01:16:12,696 --> 01:16:14,994
A crime is happening right
before your eyes!

753
01:16:15,199 --> 01:16:16,223
Fire!

754
01:16:22,206 --> 01:16:24,333
Sir, Shankar Rao is on line!

755
01:16:25,376 --> 01:16:25,842
Tell me!

756
01:16:26,043 --> 01:16:33,006
Down your gun and send him and
those software guys respectfully.

757
01:16:33,217 --> 01:16:38,678
Entire state is watching the
scene live using spy camera!

758
01:16:50,234 --> 01:16:53,362
You said govt. is yours and
can do anything!

759
01:16:53,570 --> 01:16:55,697
You're struggling to breathe!

760
01:16:56,407 --> 01:17:00,867
Power is not in position
its in your self confidence!

761
01:17:01,078 --> 01:17:03,706
Shouldn't software engineers buy lands?

762
01:17:03,914 --> 01:17:06,382
lnfact they're responsible
for the land boom!

763
01:17:06,917 --> 01:17:12,219
Are you attacking them who used their
intelligence to earn billions for the state?

764
01:17:12,423 --> 01:17:16,723
lf they leave their jobs and
think about you for 5 minutes,

765
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:18,053
did you see how would it be?

766
01:17:18,262 --> 01:17:21,390
How dare you come from Rayalaseema
and beat a Minister's son?

767
01:17:21,598 --> 01:17:25,898
lf a Telugu man cries about
injustice meted to him,

768
01:17:26,103 --> 01:17:28,230
not just Hyderabad,

769
01:17:28,439 --> 01:17:33,968
l'll come to
any place on earth to beat the unjust!

770
01:17:36,947 --> 01:17:41,407
Don't plan to kill me by letting
out an old jail bird!

771
01:17:42,286 --> 01:17:43,753
Plan must be like this!

772
01:17:44,788 --> 01:17:48,417
l know he's alive! Try again !

773
01:18:06,810 --> 01:18:10,268
Shift him to hospital immediately,
his pulse rate is going down.

774
01:18:10,481 --> 01:18:12,949
lf it still goes down,
he may go into coma.

775
01:18:18,822 --> 01:18:22,952
Are you here for 2 minute silence?

776
01:18:23,827 --> 01:18:25,294
Did you watch TV?

777
01:18:25,662 --> 01:18:27,630
We're getting bombarded!

778
01:18:27,831 --> 01:18:30,800
You said about a plan to win
in 11 constituencies,

779
01:18:31,001 --> 01:18:32,798
we lost hope in all
the constituencies.

780
01:18:34,004 --> 01:18:36,302
l thought you were a
powerful police man !

781
01:18:36,507 --> 01:18:39,135
Didn't expect you were so meek?

782
01:18:39,343 --> 01:18:40,469
Why are you staring at me?
Please listen to me.

783
01:18:40,677 --> 01:18:43,475
We'll be in trouble if he's here.
Kill him!

784
01:18:44,848 --> 01:18:46,975
Tell Cl of that area to issue a statement,

785
01:18:47,184 --> 01:18:51,484
that he was killed in an encounter
while trying to kill Ramakrishna Prasad.

786
01:18:52,523 --> 01:18:58,826
l'll tell you later the plan
to kill Ramakrishna.

787
01:19:07,704 --> 01:19:12,004
lt's impossible for you
to kill Ramakrishna!

788
01:19:12,709 --> 01:19:15,337
Only l can kill him!

789
01:19:15,546 --> 01:19:17,173
Will you on stretcher to kill him?

790
01:19:17,381 --> 01:19:23,843
Not me, l'll use Ramakrishna's
son to kill him!

791
01:19:24,054 --> 01:19:29,014
His son? Narrating a new tale?

792
01:19:29,226 --> 01:19:36,189
Call the Cl whom you wanted to
issue a statement and find out,

793
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:41,531
to check if there's any complaint
lodged for his missing son.

794
01:19:45,742 --> 01:19:51,772
Son would reach Rayalaseema
in search of his family,

795
01:19:53,250 --> 01:19:57,380
this is enough,
the people who revere him as God,

796
01:19:57,588 --> 01:20:01,388
l'll make the same people to hate them
and get lynched by them!

797
01:20:17,608 --> 01:20:18,734
Are you sleeping?

798
01:20:19,276 --> 01:20:25,408
lnstead of 50's and 100's, if you
give 1000 notes in a suitcase,

799
01:20:25,616 --> 01:20:27,709
it'll be comfortable
to travel back!

800
01:20:32,956 --> 01:20:35,584
l too want to tell you
an important thing.

801
01:20:35,959 --> 01:20:39,486
You won't cheat me because l had
accepted without an agreement, right?

802
01:20:39,796 --> 01:20:42,822
Generally people give reward
if you take home missing children.

803
01:20:43,634 --> 01:20:45,932
l went missing as kid and
if you take me home now,

804
01:20:46,136 --> 01:20:47,103
what would they give you?

805
01:20:47,304 --> 01:20:50,762
People who promised a crore
would just offer a coffee.

806
01:20:50,974 --> 01:20:52,942
So, tell them l refused to come,

807
01:20:53,143 --> 01:20:56,112
and when l fell unconscious,
you brought me here!

808
01:20:56,313 --> 01:20:57,780
l'll give you a crore!

809
01:20:58,148 --> 01:21:00,776
lf you claim to have lost your
Rolex watch in the fight,

810
01:21:00,984 --> 01:21:02,952
they'd pay you extra!

811
01:21:04,154 --> 01:21:06,622
Won't l get massaged in Mars
if you're with me?

812
01:21:06,823 --> 01:21:09,792
You sleep well with a band aid,
l'll run the show from here!

813
01:21:27,678 --> 01:21:29,145
What happened to him?

814
01:21:29,346 --> 01:21:31,974
You're asking about him,
do you know him?

815
01:21:32,349 --> 01:21:33,145
l know.

816
01:21:33,684 --> 01:21:35,549
lf you knew about him,
why didn't you tell us?

817
01:21:36,687 --> 01:21:38,314
Uncle told me not to tell you.

818
01:21:42,359 --> 01:21:45,658
Though uncle pleaded,

819
01:21:45,862 --> 01:21:48,558
he left saying that his foster
parents were his real parents.

820
01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:52,669
lf you know that son whom
we lost forever has returned,

821
01:21:52,869 --> 01:21:56,828
he told me not to tell fearing
you'd be very sad.

822
01:22:05,716 --> 01:22:09,174
Why did you stop there?
Come in son !

823
01:22:11,221 --> 01:22:13,189
l've only two wishes in my life.

824
01:22:14,391 --> 01:22:17,019
When l lost hope of getting
those wishes fulfilled,

825
01:22:18,061 --> 01:22:19,585
long lost son has returned,

826
01:22:21,231 --> 01:22:25,861
come in and fulfill
my second wish too, son !

827
01:22:29,573 --> 01:22:31,541
Why are you angry and obstinate?

828
01:22:31,742 --> 01:22:33,539
l begged him more than you
and convinced him.

829
01:22:33,744 --> 01:22:34,711
Still he didn't listen to me.

830
01:22:34,911 --> 01:22:37,379
l hit him on head and
he fell unconscious,

831
01:22:37,581 --> 01:22:38,878
l brought him here.

832
01:22:39,583 --> 01:22:42,882
l lost my Rolex watch in that melee.

833
01:22:43,086 --> 01:22:45,213
Rs.20 lakhs! Did l care about it?

834
01:22:45,422 --> 01:22:46,389
l brought him here!

835
01:22:46,590 --> 01:22:48,888
You brought him our family's diamond!

836
01:22:49,092 --> 01:22:50,559
Forget about that lost Rolex watch !

837
01:22:50,761 --> 01:22:51,887
l'll buy a diamond watch.

838
01:22:52,095 --> 01:22:55,223
Not only that l lost
my gold chain too.

839
01:22:55,432 --> 01:22:57,229
l couldn't find it.

840
01:23:25,128 --> 01:23:27,426
Bobby, you're genius!

841
01:23:27,631 --> 01:23:29,428
Our Rolex watch plan
has worked out well.

842
01:23:29,633 --> 01:23:31,260
Why did you bring me here?

843
01:23:32,469 --> 01:23:34,437
What can l do if you change
plan suddenly?

844
01:23:34,638 --> 01:23:36,435
l'm asking you,
why did you bring me here?

845
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:38,767
Our plan...

846
01:23:40,143 --> 01:23:41,440
Please stop!

847
01:23:41,978 --> 01:23:45,436
You're my uncle's son, l can prove it.

848
01:23:45,649 --> 01:23:47,116
What's there to prove?

849
01:23:47,317 --> 01:23:49,615
l came here as a friend and
leave as a friend.

850
01:23:49,820 --> 01:23:51,287
Don't force relationship on me,

851
01:23:51,488 --> 01:23:53,456
don't get hurt for it later
and hurt me too!

852
01:23:53,824 --> 01:23:54,620
Son,

853
01:23:56,493 --> 01:24:00,452
you may be affectionate
on your foster parents,

854
01:24:00,664 --> 01:24:03,963
please show empathy towards me too!

855
01:24:04,167 --> 01:24:07,295
l can understand your pain.

856
01:24:08,338 --> 01:24:10,135
l'm not your long lost son.

857
01:24:10,841 --> 01:24:13,469
Hubby, please tell him.

858
01:24:13,677 --> 01:24:15,645
What he said is also right,

859
01:24:15,846 --> 01:24:18,644
we gave him birth but
did we raise him fondly?

860
01:24:18,849 --> 01:24:21,977
lt is his duty to go to
the people who raised him.

861
01:24:22,519 --> 01:24:22,985
Let him go.

862
01:24:23,186 --> 01:24:26,815
Please don't tie me with
bonds and relationships.

863
01:24:28,525 --> 01:24:29,150
Uncle...

864
01:24:33,196 --> 01:24:35,994
Please ask him to stay
at least few days with me.

865
01:24:39,536 --> 01:24:40,161
Stop!

866
01:24:42,205 --> 01:24:43,672
Though not as our son,

867
01:24:44,541 --> 01:24:47,510
let him stay
here for 10 days as her friend.

868
01:24:50,547 --> 01:24:54,005
Okay, since you asked me, l'll stay!

869
01:24:54,384 --> 01:24:55,510
As a friend only!

870
01:25:23,580 --> 01:25:27,380
A man whom people revere as God...

871
01:25:27,584 --> 01:25:31,042
Don't know why he has
stayed out of temple?

872
01:25:31,254 --> 01:25:36,886
When would he enter the threshold?

873
01:25:38,929 --> 01:25:42,387
Lord Rama who returned after
14 years of exile...

874
01:25:42,599 --> 01:25:46,399
When would he be crowned
as the prince?

875
01:25:46,603 --> 01:25:51,734
When would he walk tall
among his people?

876
01:25:54,277 --> 01:25:57,906
Why close relations are so obstinate?

877
01:25:58,114 --> 01:26:01,743
Why there are entwined knots
in the garland of flowers?

878
01:26:01,952 --> 01:26:06,582
Though everyone have love,
it's hidden deep inside the hearts...

879
01:26:09,793 --> 01:26:16,426
Though all are from one family,
everyone is going in a different way...

880
01:26:34,484 --> 01:26:41,788
Though hills are full of rocks,
there's wetness inside it too...

881
01:26:41,992 --> 01:26:48,955
Though eyes turn red on seeing,
there's a trace of affection when closed...

882
01:26:49,165 --> 01:26:56,628
The more you share love
the more it grows...

883
01:26:56,840 --> 01:27:04,303
Let the anger subside,
father and son come closer...

884
01:27:04,514 --> 01:27:07,972
Why wrong notes in such
a perfect family?

885
01:27:08,184 --> 01:27:12,814
Why God is so merciless on them?

886
01:27:13,023 --> 01:27:17,221
Why is the innocent man in jail?

887
01:27:20,864 --> 01:27:26,825
Why love is sentencing
such harsh punishments?

888
01:27:49,125 --> 01:27:52,583
Won't the heart come back
as ball hit on wall?

889
01:27:52,796 --> 01:27:56,425
Won't it remember the love
of parents and hometown?

890
01:27:56,633 --> 01:28:03,766
Won't a mother be happy and
jump in joy like a calf?

891
01:28:03,973 --> 01:28:11,277
Though the shore stops it,
would the waves stop coming again?

892
01:28:11,481 --> 01:28:18,785
Though there's distance between hearts,
can honey ever turn bitter?

893
01:28:18,988 --> 01:28:27,453
Why this fire in the fort of love?
Who would douse it?

894
01:28:28,932 --> 01:28:36,395
Why there are so many
questions without answers?

895
01:28:36,606 --> 01:28:44,069
Though it's bright,
they're still sitting in darkness...

896
01:28:55,625 --> 01:28:56,421
Stop!

897
01:28:59,295 --> 01:29:01,763
You made a mistake by
breaking the family photo.

898
01:29:02,632 --> 01:29:05,430
l can bear if you disown this family,

899
01:29:06,136 --> 01:29:11,597
but can't bear if you hurt the man who
is living like a servant in outhouse.

900
01:29:12,142 --> 01:29:13,769
Why is he living in outhouse?

901
01:29:20,150 --> 01:29:22,277
He's not my son, he's your
grandpa's first wife's son.

902
01:29:24,654 --> 01:29:33,289
When she died, he married me
after elders forced him.

903
01:29:35,665 --> 01:29:37,462
Do you know how great
man he was!

904
01:29:38,835 --> 01:29:41,804
A man who never forgives
even small mistakes.

905
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:47,640
When you visited here every week,
l thought it's your affection for me,

906
01:29:47,844 --> 01:29:51,803
you've an affair with the
maid servant! You dirty rogue!

907
01:29:52,182 --> 01:29:54,480
lf my husband comes to know this,
he would bury you alive.

908
01:29:54,684 --> 01:29:58,484
lf you pay Rs.1 lakh, she would
abort the child secretly.

909
01:29:58,688 --> 01:30:01,156
l don't have the right to
spend money as l wish !

910
01:30:02,192 --> 01:30:05,821
Though l'm the mistress of the house,
elder son's writ runs large in the home!

911
01:30:07,197 --> 01:30:10,826
People respect this family and
l'm the chief maid here!

912
01:30:11,367 --> 01:30:13,494
Where can l get so much money?

913
01:30:22,879 --> 01:30:24,346
Where did you get so much money?

914
01:30:26,216 --> 01:30:27,683
Did you steal?

915
01:30:28,384 --> 01:30:29,009
No sir!

916
01:30:29,219 --> 01:30:31,016
Who gave you so much money?

917
01:30:32,388 --> 01:30:33,685
l'm asking you !

918
01:30:33,890 --> 01:30:35,084
l gave her, father!

919
01:30:36,059 --> 01:30:38,527
Why?
- To abort a pregnancy!

920
01:30:40,730 --> 01:30:43,198
Why are you still here?
Take money and leave the place.

921
01:30:55,078 --> 01:30:58,878
l made a mistake by pampering
you as a motherless child.

922
01:31:00,250 --> 01:31:03,708
l gave the responsibility of running
home to make you understand it.

923
01:31:04,420 --> 01:31:06,718
But not to make mistakes
beyond your age.

924
01:31:12,929 --> 01:31:16,057
From today, you take care of this house!

925
01:31:17,433 --> 01:31:21,460
For the sin of fathering him,
l'll feed him!

926
01:31:23,273 --> 01:31:25,741
But he must live like a servant
in the back yard.

927
01:31:27,110 --> 01:31:32,070
The right to call me as father
and entering my home,

928
01:31:32,282 --> 01:31:33,909
tell him he has lost it forever!

929
01:31:40,957 --> 01:31:44,916
Sister, my nephew is the
lone heir to this family.

930
01:31:46,462 --> 01:31:48,930
Put him down !
- Sister!

931
01:31:49,132 --> 01:31:50,099
Put him down.

932
01:31:52,302 --> 01:31:56,432
lf you ever enter this home or
show your face to me again,

933
01:31:56,639 --> 01:31:59,437
l'll kill you !
Get out!

934
01:32:02,145 --> 01:32:04,272
Because of my brother's mistake,

935
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:07,278
fearing his wife and children
would end up on streets,

936
01:32:07,817 --> 01:32:09,785
he took the blame on himself.

937
01:32:10,987 --> 01:32:12,614
Though my husband died years ago,

938
01:32:13,990 --> 01:32:18,188
he's still serving the
punishment given to him.

939
01:32:33,676 --> 01:32:35,143
Don't raise hell unnecessarily!

940
01:32:35,345 --> 01:32:38,314
l need money urgently,
will you give or not?

941
01:32:38,514 --> 01:32:42,473
Why? For bringing me here,
l've promised a crore as reward.

942
01:32:44,354 --> 01:32:46,322
l'm talking to my parents
for your money only.

943
01:32:46,522 --> 01:32:48,820
Parents? Which parents?

944
01:32:49,025 --> 01:32:51,152
My foster parents.

945
01:32:54,364 --> 01:32:57,822
You mean with aliens?
- Yes.

946
01:32:58,534 --> 01:33:02,163
We both are humans,
why don't l see what you can see?

947
01:33:02,372 --> 01:33:03,839
ls that your doubt?

948
01:33:04,040 --> 01:33:11,173
l got my eye operated in L V Prasad
eye hospital before Mad max,

949
01:33:11,381 --> 01:33:13,906
so l can see and you can't!

950
01:33:15,218 --> 01:33:17,186
There's a hospital by the
same name in Hyderabad too!

951
01:33:18,888 --> 01:33:21,857
Where?
- Opposite to Cinemax!

952
01:33:22,892 --> 01:33:25,190
You don't believe me, right?

953
01:33:27,063 --> 01:33:28,690
l don't need to beg you.

954
01:33:28,898 --> 01:33:31,196
No need to give me a crore, you go.

955
01:33:32,235 --> 01:33:35,534
l saw you landing on earth from Mars,
how can l not believe you?

956
01:33:35,738 --> 01:33:38,036
They may leave without giving
money, please stop them.

957
01:33:38,241 --> 01:33:41,210
How can they leave?
They're on a hunger strike.

958
01:33:41,577 --> 01:33:44,876
How did they know this address?

959
01:33:45,081 --> 01:33:46,378
l told them.
- Why?

960
01:33:46,582 --> 01:33:48,379
l told them to bring your money.

961
01:33:48,584 --> 01:33:51,712
Our Rolex plan was working out
and they entered then !

962
01:33:51,921 --> 01:33:53,388
lf l accept them as my parents,

963
01:33:53,589 --> 01:33:56,217
they have threatened me
with fast unto death !

964
01:33:56,426 --> 01:33:58,553
l had to beat you in that
complicated situation.

965
01:33:59,762 --> 01:34:01,889
l got you clearly.

966
01:34:02,098 --> 01:34:05,727
You do one thing,
draw a circle around them.

967
01:34:05,935 --> 01:34:07,402
l'll take care of them.

968
01:34:17,613 --> 01:34:19,740
Bobby, you inside and be happy.

969
01:34:19,949 --> 01:34:22,076
What about your money?
- l'll collect it.

970
01:34:22,285 --> 01:34:23,582
How?
- How?

971
01:34:23,786 --> 01:34:26,254
l'll end their fast
by offering lemon juice.

972
01:34:32,128 --> 01:34:37,259
As days pass,
l feel like losing my life.

973
01:34:40,970 --> 01:34:46,931
l know you too are sad like me.

974
01:34:48,644 --> 01:34:50,942
l've never asked you anything till now.

975
01:34:52,315 --> 01:34:55,773
But today l'm asking you.

976
01:34:57,487 --> 01:35:02,117
Do something and ensure
my son stays with me.

977
01:35:29,852 --> 01:35:31,319
How dare you kiss me before marriage!

978
01:35:32,522 --> 01:35:35,320
lf you're feeling shy to talk
to your parents,

979
01:35:35,525 --> 01:35:36,822
l'll talk to them.

980
01:35:37,527 --> 01:35:39,654
But it's wrong to cross limits.

981
01:35:44,867 --> 01:35:45,993
l didn't do anything wrong.

982
01:35:46,202 --> 01:35:49,171
Arrange a marriage feast and
correct your mistake.

983
01:36:02,552 --> 01:36:04,520
What did you do just now?
- What did l do?

984
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:08,019
You did the wrong thing
and blamed me for it.

985
01:36:08,224 --> 01:36:11,022
Then, let's do the
wrong thing together!

986
01:36:11,227 --> 01:36:12,353
Won't you?

987
01:36:12,728 --> 01:36:14,525
Just because l said it's wrong
to kiss before marriage,

988
01:36:14,730 --> 01:36:16,027
will you refuse to marry me?

989
01:36:16,232 --> 01:36:17,859
Why are you fighting for
a small issue, sir?

990
01:36:18,067 --> 01:36:20,695
Who so ever may do the wrong,
they have to undergo punishment.

991
01:36:20,903 --> 01:36:23,030
Sir, you must arrange marriage feast.

992
01:36:23,239 --> 01:36:25,537
Madam, go ahead,
don't get scared.

993
01:36:28,911 --> 01:36:29,707
Did you see?

994
01:36:30,746 --> 01:36:33,214
How you're
getting trapped in my plan?

995
01:36:33,916 --> 01:36:37,875
You've to be in my arms all the life.

996
01:36:56,939 --> 01:36:59,737
Beauty is sensational,
latch the door...

997
01:36:59,942 --> 01:37:02,911
l'm here with love...

998
01:37:03,112 --> 01:37:05,740
Youth is open school,
l've opened it for you...

999
01:37:05,948 --> 01:37:08,576
Come with me...

1000
01:37:08,784 --> 01:37:11,412
Your cheeks are shy with dimples...

1001
01:37:11,621 --> 01:37:14,749
Your swinging waist is alluring...

1002
01:37:14,957 --> 01:37:17,755
Rock me...

1003
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:20,929
lt's a type of selecting
the groom openly...

1004
01:38:09,512 --> 01:38:14,313
Somewhere l'm feeling the itch...
- The cot is squeaking...

1005
01:38:15,017 --> 01:38:17,815
l felt the shock with your touch...

1006
01:38:18,020 --> 01:38:20,818
The cot squeaked with
our love wrestle...

1007
01:38:21,023 --> 01:38:26,655
My heart yearns for
your pending kisses..

1008
01:38:26,862 --> 01:38:31,492
Don't lose heart,
l'll settle with interest...

1009
01:38:31,701 --> 01:38:37,333
You've come in hot sun...
quench your hunger with a quick bite...

1010
01:39:13,743 --> 01:39:19,375
You're hot and spicy...
- You've left bite marks...

1011
01:39:19,582 --> 01:39:22,380
You're hot like chilly...

1012
01:39:22,585 --> 01:39:25,383
You left marks of love bites...

1013
01:39:25,588 --> 01:39:31,220
You're a great arena,
let me play the game of love in it...

1014
01:39:31,427 --> 01:39:36,057
Let's till the land all the night...

1015
01:39:36,265 --> 01:39:42,397
Let's rock the night,
it's a different type of bliss...

1016
01:40:03,793 --> 01:40:06,091
You're not allowing anyone
to come here.

1017
01:40:06,295 --> 01:40:07,922
Tractors are coming for
loading the bags.

1018
01:40:08,130 --> 01:40:10,758
Leave alone tractors,
not even cycle tyres must come here.

1019
01:40:10,966 --> 01:40:11,933
What would happen if it comes?

1020
01:40:12,134 --> 01:40:15,934
lf you run over without them,
two lives would get snuffed out.

1021
01:40:16,305 --> 01:40:19,604
Sir...sir...

1022
01:40:19,809 --> 01:40:20,605
Why are you shouting loudly?

1023
01:40:20,810 --> 01:40:22,437
He's talking like a mad man.

1024
01:40:22,645 --> 01:40:24,272
That's not madness but pranic healing.

1025
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:25,276
What's that, sir?

1026
01:40:25,481 --> 01:40:28,450
lf we talk with wind, bad ideas
would go out from our system,

1027
01:40:28,651 --> 01:40:29,777
and good thoughts would come to us.

1028
01:40:29,985 --> 01:40:31,452
Do your work.
- Okay sir.

1029
01:40:32,655 --> 01:40:34,282
Why are you so sad?

1030
01:40:34,490 --> 01:40:36,117
What am l to say if you ask like that?

1031
01:40:36,325 --> 01:40:41,786
My hands are tired making lemon juice
but your parents are not budging.

1032
01:40:44,667 --> 01:40:49,969
They left with a note and money
after breaking their fast.

1033
01:40:50,172 --> 01:40:50,968
Slip? Where is it?

1034
01:40:54,176 --> 01:40:55,302
Did they leave behind money?

1035
01:40:55,511 --> 01:40:56,637
Hold your hands together.

1036
01:41:03,352 --> 01:41:06,981
Sorry, they kept 10 wads of
Rs.500 notes,

1037
01:41:07,189 --> 01:41:09,316
it's a bit of extra luggage,
please don't get angry.

1038
01:41:09,525 --> 01:41:12,153
But l can't see anything.

1039
01:41:12,361 --> 01:41:13,658
When you can't see the people
who gave it,

1040
01:41:13,863 --> 01:41:15,330
how can you see their money?

1041
01:41:15,531 --> 01:41:17,658
What should l do to see the money?

1042
01:41:17,867 --> 01:41:24,670
Get your eyes operated in L V Prasad
Hospital opposite to Mad Max.

1043
01:41:24,874 --> 01:41:28,833
So, l must get everyone's eyes
operated to see this money, right?

1044
01:41:29,044 --> 01:41:29,669
That's it.

1045
01:41:29,879 --> 01:41:30,846
How much would it cost me?

1046
01:41:31,046 --> 01:41:34,846
You can't see that money unless you
sell Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.

1047
01:41:35,050 --> 01:41:36,677
l don't want the money l can't see.

1048
01:41:36,886 --> 01:41:38,854
l beg you !

1049
01:41:39,054 --> 01:41:42,854
Give me money l can see
to go home, l beg you.

1050
01:41:46,896 --> 01:41:47,863
So much money?

1051
01:41:48,063 --> 01:41:53,865
Don't waste your time for
easy money and unseen money.

1052
01:41:55,404 --> 01:41:56,200
Go!

1053
01:42:08,918 --> 01:42:13,218
You were going back,
family is getting attached to you.

1054
01:42:13,422 --> 01:42:16,050
lt's dangerous to the family
as well as this region.

1055
01:42:16,425 --> 01:42:18,052
Leave as you came here.

1056
01:42:18,928 --> 01:42:21,226
Do at least this one good thing
in your life!

1057
01:42:28,604 --> 01:42:29,730
You asked me to come alone,

1058
01:42:31,106 --> 01:42:34,075
you vanished without a trace
for one shot!

1059
01:42:34,276 --> 01:42:37,905
To call yourself as my enemy,
you need status!

1060
01:43:00,302 --> 01:43:02,429
Why did you come with
a battalion of police?

1061
01:43:02,638 --> 01:43:04,162
We're here to investigate a murder.

1062
01:43:05,474 --> 01:43:06,941
Do you know where you've
come to investigate?

1063
01:43:07,142 --> 01:43:09,440
A temple!
Please go away.

1064
01:43:09,645 --> 01:43:11,112
We've evidence.

1065
01:43:11,814 --> 01:43:14,282
Court has ordered to take him
into remand if proven guilty.

1066
01:43:14,483 --> 01:43:16,451
They don't listen to words,
can hear only action.

1067
01:43:16,652 --> 01:43:17,448
Kill them!

1068
01:43:17,820 --> 01:43:18,844
Stop!

1069
01:43:20,990 --> 01:43:23,618
Allow them to do their duty
by honouring the law!

1070
01:43:33,502 --> 01:43:36,630
We've to check your finger prints,
can you please come here?

1071
01:43:52,688 --> 01:43:54,986
Both finger prints are
matching perfectly,

1072
01:43:55,190 --> 01:43:56,316
he's the killer!

1073
01:44:01,030 --> 01:44:04,659
Harishchandra Prasad was killed
here 20 years ago.

1074
01:44:05,534 --> 01:44:07,502
This country made pistol
was used to kill him.

1075
01:44:07,703 --> 01:44:12,003
Everyone in family got their finger
prints checked with ones on the gun.

1076
01:44:12,875 --> 01:44:15,673
But the finger prints on it
tallies with his finger prints.

1077
01:44:15,878 --> 01:44:21,180
A kid killed him then, how can his
finger prints match with junior boss?

1078
01:44:21,383 --> 01:44:24,841
Finger prints remain same in life.

1079
01:44:25,054 --> 01:44:27,022
They never change.

1080
01:44:27,222 --> 01:44:29,850
He killed him and he ordered it,
so we're arresting them both.

1081
01:44:30,059 --> 01:44:32,186
How can my son kill my husband?

1082
01:44:32,394 --> 01:44:35,022
Can you dare to arrest and take him?

1083
01:44:35,230 --> 01:44:36,857
lf you've guts, take a step!

1084
01:44:40,903 --> 01:44:44,202
You love your son very much.

1085
01:44:44,406 --> 01:44:47,864
But your son doesn't love you.

1086
01:44:48,077 --> 01:44:52,207
Refusing father's property and
political legacy,

1087
01:44:52,414 --> 01:44:54,211
staying in your own backyard,

1088
01:44:54,416 --> 01:44:57,044
he made you believe his son went missing,

1089
01:44:57,252 --> 01:44:59,379
he sent him away to raise secretly,

1090
01:44:59,588 --> 01:45:03,046
and made him a cold blooded
killer since his childhood,

1091
01:45:04,927 --> 01:45:06,554
for the sake of power,

1092
01:45:06,762 --> 01:45:14,066
he's great political leader who
killed father of this Rayalaseema!

1093
01:45:14,269 --> 01:45:15,896
Your step son !

1094
01:45:17,039 --> 01:45:23,501
He's accusing you of killing
your father by your son,

1095
01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:25,339
why are you silent, son?

1096
01:45:25,547 --> 01:45:29,347
Just say no, people would
take care of them.

1097
01:45:32,454 --> 01:45:36,254
Why are you silent? Answer me!

1098
01:45:39,128 --> 01:45:39,924
He killed!

1099
01:45:50,472 --> 01:45:52,770
Mother!
- Don't touch me.

1100
01:45:54,643 --> 01:46:01,276
With the same that killed him
you offered obsequies too!

1101
01:46:01,483 --> 01:46:04,611
That would've hurt his soul too!

1102
01:46:06,822 --> 01:46:11,122
l've heard about fathers raising
their sons to become great men.

1103
01:46:11,326 --> 01:46:16,958
You'd be the first father
to make your son a killer!

1104
01:46:18,500 --> 01:46:22,960
You could do anything for power,

1105
01:46:23,172 --> 01:46:27,302
you made us believe you lived
for our sake, uncle.

1106
01:46:31,680 --> 01:46:35,639
Till you made us revere you
and made us lose trust on God too.

1107
01:46:40,189 --> 01:46:42,817
You'd have a dog's death !

1108
01:46:43,025 --> 01:46:45,323
Who said that?
- You committed mistake and then...

1109
01:46:45,527 --> 01:46:46,323
Stop!

1110
01:46:47,029 --> 01:46:52,661
Take them away before people
kill them in rage, DGP!

1111
01:47:20,896 --> 01:47:22,022
Don't touch me!

1112
01:47:23,899 --> 01:47:27,699
l wish to die for
what you did just now. Go!

1113
01:47:31,573 --> 01:47:34,701
Have you lost trust on God?

1114
01:47:35,244 --> 01:47:37,712
You've made this a God less region !

1115
01:47:37,913 --> 01:47:40,211
Why are you backing your father's killer?

1116
01:47:40,415 --> 01:47:46,786
Not just back him but pray him like God!

1117
01:47:47,589 --> 01:47:50,717
Will you say my brother
would meet a dog's death?

1118
01:47:51,927 --> 01:47:54,555
When Govts. too didn't bother
about you,

1119
01:47:54,763 --> 01:48:02,135
my father started the good work
of rehabilitating your lives,

1120
01:48:02,604 --> 01:48:07,405
my brother stayed behind
and lead him forward!

1121
01:48:07,609 --> 01:48:08,576
Do you know that?

1122
01:49:02,331 --> 01:49:03,298
l don't have a laptop.

1123
01:49:10,839 --> 01:49:11,965
How great your country is,

1124
01:49:12,174 --> 01:49:13,801
why should we come there to invest?

1125
01:49:14,009 --> 01:49:15,806
You must also in visual
as other countries did,

1126
01:49:16,011 --> 01:49:19,970
if you don't how can we decide
to start projects there or not?

1127
01:49:20,182 --> 01:49:21,206
ls it?

1128
01:49:21,683 --> 01:49:23,310
There's no mathematics without zero,

1129
01:49:23,518 --> 01:49:24,485
without mathematics,

1130
01:49:24,686 --> 01:49:28,986
there would be no computers or
laptops that you depend on.

1131
01:49:29,191 --> 01:49:31,659
lt's our Aryabhatta who gave
zero to the world.

1132
01:49:32,194 --> 01:49:35,163
Should l tell the greatness
of my country,

1133
01:49:35,364 --> 01:49:38,492
or say why should you invest
in my country?

1134
01:49:39,701 --> 01:49:40,998
Tell project details.

1135
01:49:43,372 --> 01:49:44,839
Give these reports to all delegates.

1136
01:49:46,208 --> 01:49:50,338
lndia is world number 3
in exporting iron ore.

1137
01:49:50,545 --> 01:49:53,673
We're exporting 100 million
tons every year.

1138
01:49:53,882 --> 01:49:56,350
We'll divert the material
to this project.

1139
01:49:57,052 --> 01:50:03,355
Not only that we'll h=give skilled
work force at one fourth cost.

1140
01:50:03,558 --> 01:50:08,018
We'll allot 5000 acres of land
for this project in Rayalaseema.

1141
01:50:09,898 --> 01:50:11,195
There's a mistake in your report.

1142
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:12,367
What's the mistake?

1143
01:50:12,567 --> 01:50:14,865
The iron ore in your country
isn't of primary grade.

1144
01:50:15,070 --> 01:50:18,699
Second grade iron ore, to clean it
and make it into iron,

1145
01:50:18,907 --> 01:50:20,704
it would cost more than
other countries.

1146
01:50:20,909 --> 01:50:23,207
Don't know if you think
we don't know geology,

1147
01:50:23,412 --> 01:50:26,870
or cheat us to take this
project to your country,

1148
01:50:27,082 --> 01:50:28,379
l don't understand!

1149
01:50:32,421 --> 01:50:35,549
Even after decades of independence,
they didn't achieve anything.

1150
01:50:35,757 --> 01:50:39,056
Except corruption, rowdyism,
politics and naxalism!

1151
01:50:41,596 --> 01:50:45,896
This project is in the
faction ridden Rayalaseema.

1152
01:50:46,101 --> 01:50:50,060
We'll lose money with so many
problems there, can't make money.

1153
01:50:53,275 --> 01:50:54,640
Think over it gentlemen !

1154
01:50:57,446 --> 01:51:00,244
Which country do you belong to?

1155
01:51:00,949 --> 01:51:02,576
Which is cricket's birth place?

1156
01:51:02,784 --> 01:51:05,412
Don't you know that too?
My country!

1157
01:51:05,620 --> 01:51:07,986
Did it win world cup at least once?

1158
01:51:12,961 --> 01:51:15,759
Your country ruled over
my country for 200 years,

1159
01:51:15,964 --> 01:51:21,596
we've put satellites into orbit,
could your country do it?

1160
01:51:23,805 --> 01:51:26,103
Didn't we achieve anything?

1161
01:51:26,308 --> 01:51:29,277
lf l start telling your life
is not enough to hear it.

1162
01:51:29,478 --> 01:51:34,438
Only few politicians are corrupt
not our people.

1163
01:51:36,151 --> 01:51:37,778
lf we take loan and
are unable to repay it,

1164
01:51:37,986 --> 01:51:43,288
we take our lives for honour
but not steal from others!

1165
01:51:43,992 --> 01:51:46,460
lf there's one factionist
in each area of Rayalaseema,

1166
01:51:46,661 --> 01:51:48,959
there's one in every family
who goes with him.

1167
01:51:50,165 --> 01:51:53,464
lf you start the project there,
factionism will fade out,

1168
01:51:53,668 --> 01:52:00,130
l'm here with good intention that
every family would have one employee.

1169
01:52:00,342 --> 01:52:03,470
Neither l nor my country have
no intention of cheating you.

1170
01:52:04,012 --> 01:52:05,809
l don't want these arguments,

1171
01:52:06,014 --> 01:52:08,812
would we get losses or not
if we use second grade ore?

1172
01:52:09,017 --> 01:52:10,644
Please answer that.

1173
01:52:10,852 --> 01:52:13,821
You stopped with the
mistake on page 3,

1174
01:52:14,022 --> 01:52:16,650
if you go to page 5, you can
find the answer, check it.

1175
01:52:21,196 --> 01:52:24,495
lts true iron ore in lndia
is of second grade,

1176
01:52:25,033 --> 01:52:28,992
but the thing that can
clean it cheaply, Dolomite,

1177
01:52:29,371 --> 01:52:34,673
l mean in your geological language
calcium, magnesium, carbonate,

1178
01:52:34,876 --> 01:52:37,003
Rayalaseema is abundant with it.

1179
01:52:57,732 --> 01:53:00,530
Life is in wishing good for everyone.

1180
01:53:00,735 --> 01:53:03,704
There's nothing in wanting
everything for yourself.

1181
01:53:04,406 --> 01:53:05,532
Except death !

1182
01:53:13,081 --> 01:53:16,209
You've opened my eyes,
l'll also invest in this project.

1183
01:53:27,596 --> 01:53:32,556
Social worker Harishchandra Prasad is
pawning his wealth to start steel factory,

1184
01:53:32,767 --> 01:53:34,234
he got the seed capital
with great difficulty,

1185
01:53:34,436 --> 01:53:37,234
worked hard to get investors
from London,

1186
01:53:37,439 --> 01:53:38,906
when he made a plea for land,

1187
01:53:39,107 --> 01:53:42,406
fearing the govt. land you've been
enjoying for years would be taken back,

1188
01:53:42,611 --> 01:53:44,579
you stopped me from signing the G.O.

1189
01:53:47,282 --> 01:53:49,750
With hurt pride,
he's entering politics,

1190
01:53:49,951 --> 01:53:53,751
if he wins, you'll lose lands
and l'll lose my ministry.

1191
01:53:53,955 --> 01:53:57,914
He doesn't know about faction politics.
- He can't win.

1192
01:53:58,126 --> 01:53:59,252
He will win !

1193
01:53:59,461 --> 01:54:02,430
People love him,
nobody can defeat him.

1194
01:54:02,631 --> 01:54:04,428
Then, l'll kill him.

1195
01:54:08,637 --> 01:54:18,945
Social workers and film stars
must shudder to enter politics.

1196
01:54:19,147 --> 01:54:22,116
His death must be so gruesome!

1197
01:54:22,317 --> 01:54:28,449
Hail Harishchandra Prasad!

1198
01:54:28,657 --> 01:54:34,289
l'm grateful to you for showing love
and affection on me and my family.

1199
01:54:35,330 --> 01:54:40,131
l'm not entering politics
to get hailed by you.

1200
01:54:40,335 --> 01:54:42,530
To make your lives better.

1201
01:54:43,505 --> 01:54:46,531
You needn't have to come here
leaving your work.

1202
01:54:47,342 --> 01:54:49,139
l'll come to you.

1203
01:54:49,344 --> 01:54:54,145
Sir, l'm Penugonda Cl, l'm unable
to give you security officially.

1204
01:54:54,349 --> 01:54:57,318
But as your fan,
l'm here to save you.

1205
01:54:58,687 --> 01:55:03,147
There's confirmed news about attacking
you on the way to file nomination.

1206
01:55:03,358 --> 01:55:05,155
Aim is greater than life.

1207
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:12,163
lf that aim is good to people, it'll
turn the heat against my attackers.

1208
01:55:12,367 --> 01:55:13,493
Start the vehicles!

1209
01:55:34,389 --> 01:55:39,520
Driver and one who signs as witness
must come with me in car.

1210
01:55:39,728 --> 01:55:44,028
People want to accompany you
but you're saying no.

1211
01:55:45,066 --> 01:55:50,527
You're going against the factionism,
at least elder son with you.

1212
01:55:52,741 --> 01:55:54,709
lt's been years since
l've forgotten he's my son.

1213
01:55:55,577 --> 01:55:56,942
Don't make me remember it again.

1214
01:56:05,253 --> 01:56:06,550
Some before me as good sign
with my grandson.

1215
01:57:41,516 --> 01:57:55,328
Hail Nagulappa!...

1216
01:57:55,530 --> 01:57:58,328
How come the old man is still alive?

1217
01:57:58,533 --> 01:58:03,334
Till now we never failed in
any plan to kill opponents.

1218
01:58:24,726 --> 01:58:26,751
Did you see my capacity?

1219
01:58:28,229 --> 01:58:29,355
That's not real!

1220
01:58:31,232 --> 01:58:35,032
l think old age got you eye problem
as well as hearing problem.

1221
01:58:35,904 --> 01:58:42,707
By donating your ancestral
property to people's cause,

1222
01:58:42,911 --> 01:58:45,880
you may think you've become a leader,

1223
01:58:46,414 --> 01:58:51,545
tell him the qualities of
a leader in this region !

1224
01:58:51,920 --> 01:58:53,888
lf hungry, throw food grains,

1225
01:58:54,923 --> 01:58:58,051
if happy, get them drunk
and make them merry!

1226
01:58:59,093 --> 01:59:02,392
must have guts to sleep in anyone's
house if one gets the mood,

1227
01:59:03,264 --> 01:59:07,724
wet this land with the blood of
anyone who dares to stop you !

1228
01:59:07,936 --> 01:59:09,403
That's a leader!

1229
01:59:11,272 --> 01:59:12,899
That is also not real!

1230
01:59:15,443 --> 01:59:18,571
To abide the guidelines of EC,

1231
01:59:18,780 --> 01:59:22,580
you brought me here without
any weapons,

1232
01:59:23,284 --> 01:59:28,415
if not l would've beheaded this old man,

1233
01:59:28,623 --> 01:59:30,750
and shown his the truth.

1234
01:59:43,304 --> 01:59:44,271
Leave me, sir.

1235
01:59:44,472 --> 01:59:45,769
My family prospered because of you.

1236
01:59:45,974 --> 01:59:48,272
lf you win, entire region would prosper.

1237
01:59:48,476 --> 01:59:51,445
l'll not get a better opportunity,
l'll kill him, sir.

1238
01:59:53,481 --> 01:59:55,278
Am l having eye problem?

1239
01:59:55,483 --> 02:00:00,944
lf l had eye problem,
you'd be dead by now.

1240
02:00:01,656 --> 02:00:03,453
lf he lives,
he'll not let you win.

1241
02:00:03,658 --> 02:00:06,456
l'll kill him and
make you unopposed leader.

1242
02:00:08,663 --> 02:00:14,624
l'm entering politics to show
how good can win over bad!

1243
02:00:15,670 --> 02:00:19,970
To see that happen,
my opponent must live.

1244
02:00:20,341 --> 02:00:22,309
When he tried to kill you,

1245
02:00:22,510 --> 02:00:26,139
people who came here hailing you
didn't move an inch to save you,

1246
02:00:26,848 --> 02:00:32,309
but look what he was about
to do for helping his family!

1247
02:00:33,354 --> 02:00:35,982
That affection is for doing good.

1248
02:00:36,524 --> 02:00:38,822
lt won't diminish even
after generations.

1249
02:00:39,027 --> 02:00:42,155
lf you provoke that affection,
you can't bear it's consequences.

1250
02:00:43,031 --> 02:00:46,330
Will you throw food grains?

1251
02:00:46,534 --> 02:00:51,995
You've been enjoying govt. lands
freely for many generations,

1252
02:00:52,206 --> 02:00:55,175
l'll take back those lands,
l'll start a steel factory there,

1253
02:00:55,376 --> 02:00:56,673
l'll give job for one
in every family here,

1254
02:00:56,878 --> 02:01:00,507
l'll see that there's no one to
take the food grains you throw.

1255
02:01:01,382 --> 02:01:05,250
l'll reform them and see that
no one prepares illicit liquor.

1256
02:01:06,554 --> 02:01:10,513
lf you get mood and enter any home,

1257
02:01:10,725 --> 02:01:15,025
your heads would hang on
thresholds instead of pumpkins.

1258
02:01:19,400 --> 02:01:21,368
People here with love and affection,

1259
02:01:21,569 --> 02:01:23,696
breaking the barriers of
caste and religion,

1260
02:01:23,905 --> 02:01:26,373
without any gender differences,
men and women work together,

1261
02:01:26,574 --> 02:01:29,372
get their children educated
away from factionism,

1262
02:01:29,577 --> 02:01:30,544
making them good citizens,

1263
02:01:30,745 --> 02:01:34,203
and bringing great laurels to this
region in lndia and foreign countries,

1264
02:01:35,083 --> 02:01:38,541
this land must get wet with
their parents' happy tears,

1265
02:01:38,753 --> 02:01:40,220
not with blood!

1266
02:01:41,422 --> 02:01:44,721
Till this happens, l'm with people!

1267
02:01:54,168 --> 02:02:00,630
He's Sun who beheaded the darkness...

1268
02:02:00,842 --> 02:02:07,304
One who inspires people to do
good is a great leader...

1269
02:02:07,515 --> 02:02:14,318
Crowds have joined the
leader like a deluge..

1270
02:02:14,522 --> 02:02:21,325
He has come like Lord Shiva to
vanquish the demon of factionism...

1271
02:02:21,529 --> 02:02:28,162
Look at the walking thunder!

1272
02:02:31,639 --> 02:02:38,772
Look at the man who
terrorizes bad...

1273
02:02:38,980 --> 02:02:45,783
A leader who toiled to turn battlefields
of death into industry of workers...

1274
02:02:45,987 --> 02:02:52,290
The leader has come to take people
away from the life of violence...

1275
02:02:52,493 --> 02:02:59,296
The region which was in the
iron fists of poisonous snakes...

1276
02:02:59,500 --> 02:03:06,303
A man who filled the paths of
blood with flowers of hope...

1277
02:03:06,507 --> 02:03:13,310
Look at the courage of victory...

1278
02:03:13,514 --> 02:03:20,317
Look at the victory of people...

1279
02:03:50,551 --> 02:03:53,679
People's aspiration is his aim...

1280
02:03:53,888 --> 02:03:57,187
People's welfare is his ambition...

1281
02:03:57,391 --> 02:04:03,853
He's the sprout of hope
in the barren deserts...

1282
02:04:04,398 --> 02:04:11,031
When injustice rules the roost...

1283
02:04:11,239 --> 02:04:18,441
He's the ray of courage in
the darkness of hopelessness...

1284
02:04:52,113 --> 02:04:53,910
Bleeding profusely.
- Dress the wound.

1285
02:04:54,615 --> 02:04:57,243
We don't have this medicine,
it's available outside.

1286
02:04:57,451 --> 02:04:58,418
Bring it.

1287
02:05:45,666 --> 02:05:48,294
Give the phone to your brother.

1288
02:05:48,502 --> 02:05:49,469
He's not here.

1289
02:05:49,670 --> 02:05:55,199
He's in the temple tower
guarding your father. Call him!

1290
02:06:03,017 --> 02:06:08,978
Call him quickly, if you delay,
your nephew would die. Call him!

1291
02:06:23,037 --> 02:06:27,667
You've protected the old man very well,

1292
02:06:27,875 --> 02:06:32,835
why do you save a man who has
refused to accept you as his son?

1293
02:06:33,047 --> 02:06:35,675
Think about your son's future.

1294
02:06:35,883 --> 02:06:37,009
l have.

1295
02:06:37,218 --> 02:06:39,186
Then, leave that place.

1296
02:06:39,387 --> 02:06:40,354
l'll not.

1297
02:06:40,554 --> 02:06:42,681
l've kidnapped your son.

1298
02:06:44,225 --> 02:06:46,193
He's in my custody now.

1299
02:06:47,061 --> 02:06:54,194
Decide now whether you want 75 year
old man or your 3 year old son?

1300
02:06:54,402 --> 02:06:57,860
Future of few millions depends
on my father's ideals.

1301
02:06:58,739 --> 02:07:02,197
lf my son is sacrificed
for his ideals,

1302
02:07:02,410 --> 02:07:03,877
l'm really proud as his father.

1303
02:07:05,413 --> 02:07:06,710
Kill him!

1304
02:07:13,421 --> 02:07:14,388
Brother!

1305
02:07:16,590 --> 02:07:18,057
My son is not dead.

1306
02:07:18,259 --> 02:07:19,556
Tell everyone that he's missing.

1307
02:07:20,428 --> 02:07:22,896
lf not he may not bear at this age.

1308
02:07:44,785 --> 02:07:55,252
My brother is God who sacrificed
his son for your sake.

1309
02:08:04,972 --> 02:08:08,931
Uncle never cheated anyone.

1310
02:08:10,144 --> 02:08:13,773
He always lived for us then
and now also!

1311
02:08:15,483 --> 02:08:22,787
Did you ever realise that you're
an orphan in his upbringing?

1312
02:08:33,834 --> 02:08:39,466
What are you saying uncle?
Am l an orphan?

1313
02:08:42,343 --> 02:08:43,970
Am l not a member of your family?

1314
02:08:46,514 --> 02:08:48,641
My father after winning the elections,

1315
02:08:48,849 --> 02:08:52,307
to make his dream of starting
the steel factory,

1316
02:08:52,520 --> 02:08:54,647
he had invited NRl's to lndia,

1317
02:08:54,855 --> 02:08:57,983
he arranged their stay
in government guest house,

1318
02:08:58,192 --> 02:09:00,490
your parents too were in
that guest house,

1319
02:09:25,553 --> 02:09:26,417
Stop!

1320
02:09:29,557 --> 02:09:30,854
Foreign delegates are here.

1321
02:09:31,058 --> 02:09:35,188
lf you create trouble, not one
of you would go alive from here.

1322
02:09:44,905 --> 02:09:48,705
Are you raising guns for
beating your SP?

1323
02:09:49,910 --> 02:09:52,538
He got suspended two days earlier.

1324
02:09:53,080 --> 02:09:54,547
He's no more a police officer.

1325
02:09:54,748 --> 02:09:58,707
Down your guns.
...Down !

1326
02:10:03,257 --> 02:10:07,557
Thanks for coming to develop Rayalaseema.

1327
02:10:09,930 --> 02:10:13,388
l'm happy as well as sad to see you.

1328
02:10:13,601 --> 02:10:18,061
lf start project here,
people would get jobs,

1329
02:10:18,272 --> 02:10:20,240
you should be happy,
why are you sad?

1330
02:10:21,108 --> 02:10:25,067
l'm worried what would he do
with your women !

1331
02:10:27,948 --> 02:10:29,245
Baby!

1332
02:10:32,620 --> 02:10:35,919
Why are you getting angry
if l touch her?

1333
02:10:36,123 --> 02:10:38,921
She's my wife.
- Wife?

1334
02:10:39,460 --> 02:10:40,927
How long you're married?

1335
02:10:41,962 --> 02:10:43,088
7 years.

1336
02:10:43,297 --> 02:10:48,428
You got angry if l touch
your wife of 7 years,

1337
02:10:48,636 --> 02:10:54,597
you're occupying the land we enjoyed for
25 years and starting project there,

1338
02:10:54,808 --> 02:10:56,935
how angry should l be?

1339
02:10:57,144 --> 02:10:59,840
We came here trusting the elderly man,

1340
02:11:00,814 --> 02:11:04,113
if you harm anyone of us,
not one of you would be alive.

1341
02:11:04,318 --> 02:11:06,616
Do you trust him so much?

1342
02:11:15,829 --> 02:11:17,797
Leave me...leave me...

1343
02:11:18,666 --> 02:11:19,963
Leave her...

1344
02:11:31,679 --> 02:11:34,648
Hey you.. l will kill you...

1345
02:11:48,195 --> 02:11:49,321
Hey you...

1346
02:11:52,700 --> 02:11:55,669
Hubby...hubby...

1347
02:11:58,372 --> 02:12:00,670
This is atrocious...barbaric...

1348
02:12:01,375 --> 02:12:03,843
Stop it!
She has a little child.

1349
02:12:04,044 --> 02:12:05,170
This is unjust.

1350
02:12:36,410 --> 02:12:43,543
Are you surprised how could l kill
foreign delegates without power?

1351
02:12:44,752 --> 02:12:46,219
Not just our lands,

1352
02:12:46,420 --> 02:12:49,389
lands of ruling party MLA's
too are in it,

1353
02:12:49,590 --> 02:12:51,615
you've seen what had
happened here, right?

1354
02:12:52,092 --> 02:12:53,719
Tell this to that old man !

1355
02:12:54,928 --> 02:12:59,058
Get his sign on this paper!

1356
02:12:59,266 --> 02:13:04,226
They're not willing to invest here,
these are not Govt. lands,

1357
02:13:04,438 --> 02:13:05,905
and its private land.

1358
02:13:06,440 --> 02:13:07,737
lf you delay,

1359
02:13:07,941 --> 02:13:14,403
one person would die every 30 minutes!
Go!

1360
02:13:33,133 --> 02:13:36,432
He's sleeping, don't disturb him.

1361
02:13:50,317 --> 02:13:53,445
Brother, 30 minutes over.

1362
02:13:53,987 --> 02:13:55,284
l can't hold on anymore.

1363
02:13:56,156 --> 02:13:57,783
When l see them...

1364
02:14:11,171 --> 02:14:16,803
You lost only lives for
trusting that old man.

1365
02:14:17,177 --> 02:14:18,644
Not your honour!

1366
02:14:18,846 --> 02:14:19,972
Be happy!

1367
02:14:23,517 --> 02:14:27,317
My father thought he could achieve
anything with intelligence.

1368
02:14:27,521 --> 02:14:31,480
But understood it's useless
for beasts like you.

1369
02:14:32,192 --> 02:14:35,992
You're right, this land must
get we with blood.

1370
02:14:36,196 --> 02:14:37,823
Be ready to bleed!

1371
02:14:38,532 --> 02:14:44,164
lf you escape alive from there,
l'll sign wherever you ask me!

1372
02:15:05,893 --> 02:15:09,693
One man has come to kill hundred men !

1373
02:15:11,899 --> 02:15:15,357
To count hundred
you've to start with one!

1374
02:15:16,403 --> 02:15:18,530
Come, let's fight it out!

1375
02:16:20,300 --> 02:16:25,260
No, l'll fall at your feet...
l beg you...

1376
02:16:25,472 --> 02:16:30,933
He's the one left in my family
for trusting factionism.

1377
02:16:31,311 --> 02:16:34,109
lf you want l'll quit factionism.

1378
02:16:36,984 --> 02:16:41,114
Please tell him to spare him, sir.

1379
02:16:41,321 --> 02:16:44,119
l've been suspended two days ago.
What can l do?

1380
02:16:44,491 --> 02:16:46,618
l'll get your suspension cancelled,

1381
02:16:46,827 --> 02:16:51,287
l'll take responsibility
to all the murders here,

1382
02:16:51,498 --> 02:16:54,126
l'll sign wherever you ask me!

1383
02:17:05,345 --> 02:17:07,813
l accept my mistake,
please leave him.

1384
02:17:08,015 --> 02:17:11,212
Don't leave him, we'll not invest
here unless you kill him.

1385
02:17:15,689 --> 02:17:19,819
Shame, shyness, morals,
discipline, mercy, empathy,

1386
02:17:20,027 --> 02:17:24,157
if you think mother earth mustn't
carry this dirty rogue,

1387
02:17:24,364 --> 02:17:25,991
he must die!

1388
02:17:34,408 --> 02:17:34,999
Come!

1389
02:17:36,209 --> 02:17:37,676
Trusting our family they came here,

1390
02:17:37,878 --> 02:17:40,506
this child lost her parents,

1391
02:17:41,715 --> 02:17:44,684
it's our family's responsibility
to raise her!

1392
02:17:45,385 --> 02:17:46,181
Give her!

1393
02:17:54,728 --> 02:17:58,186
They abused him without
knowing anything about him.

1394
02:17:59,566 --> 02:18:03,525
For your sake,
for your brother's sake,

1395
02:18:04,571 --> 02:18:09,201
a man who should've been the king
lives like a servant in his own house.

1396
02:18:10,911 --> 02:18:15,041
How could you believe
he would've done the crime?

1397
02:18:18,585 --> 02:18:21,884
Do you know who killed father?

1398
02:18:26,426 --> 02:18:29,884
l want to study,
please help me to study!

1399
02:18:31,598 --> 02:18:32,394
Come!

1400
02:18:44,778 --> 02:18:46,075
Who are you, son?

1401
02:18:47,280 --> 02:18:48,406
l'm an orphan.

1402
02:18:49,282 --> 02:18:51,250
l don't have money to study.

1403
02:18:51,451 --> 02:18:53,419
Never worry about having nothing.

1404
02:18:54,287 --> 02:18:58,656
You must get the thought
what should l do to help others!

1405
02:18:59,292 --> 02:19:01,419
Only then you can reach
great heights in life.

1406
02:19:01,962 --> 02:19:04,760
lf it has to happen, study well.

1407
02:19:15,809 --> 02:19:16,776
Father!

1408
02:19:29,322 --> 02:19:30,118
Stop!

1409
02:20:11,198 --> 02:20:13,666
Are you sad?

1410
02:20:14,034 --> 02:20:19,495
lf you had thought before ruining
our political life built over years,

1411
02:20:19,706 --> 02:20:21,674
you wouldn't be mourning now,

1412
02:20:21,875 --> 02:20:24,173
shall l tell the truth that
can break your heart?

1413
02:20:25,212 --> 02:20:27,680
l didn't kill your son,

1414
02:20:28,048 --> 02:20:29,845
l've raised him,

1415
02:20:30,050 --> 02:20:34,851
l've turned him into a human weapon,
and had him kill your father!

1416
02:20:36,890 --> 02:20:40,690
l'll have him kill each one
of your family members.

1417
02:20:44,898 --> 02:20:50,097
You've thrown out brother
from outhouse too, mother.

1418
02:21:05,919 --> 02:21:10,720
l've made a mistake!
l must see my son.

1419
02:21:22,269 --> 02:21:27,229
Rayalaseema used to shiver at
the mention of a factionist's name!

1420
02:21:27,774 --> 02:21:31,904
You've weeded out the factionists.

1421
02:21:33,113 --> 02:21:39,575
l wanted to see fear in your eyes.

1422
02:21:41,788 --> 02:21:44,256
Are you thinking
how would l kill you both?

1423
02:21:45,792 --> 02:21:47,419
Ripping your body with bullets,

1424
02:21:47,627 --> 02:21:49,754
as each bullet pierces
to cut your body,

1425
02:21:49,963 --> 02:21:52,431
and as you die shouting in fear,

1426
02:21:53,300 --> 02:21:56,929
factionism will raise from the ashes,

1427
02:21:57,137 --> 02:22:01,267
not just Rayalaseema,
it'll rule all over the state.

1428
02:22:11,818 --> 02:22:12,614
Stop!

1429
02:22:15,322 --> 02:22:16,619
l like you !

1430
02:22:16,990 --> 02:22:23,793
Though surrounded by death,
you've fearlessly attacked me!

1431
02:22:24,164 --> 02:22:25,961
What makes you so brave?

1432
02:22:26,166 --> 02:22:30,466
lt's the courage of my father's ideals.

1433
02:22:30,670 --> 02:22:31,967
What are his ideals?

1434
02:22:32,172 --> 02:22:34,470
Aim is greater than life.

1435
02:22:34,674 --> 02:22:40,806
lf that aim is good to people,
it'll turn the heat against attackers.

1436
02:22:41,014 --> 02:22:43,812
Your father's ideals couldn't
save his life

1437
02:22:44,017 --> 02:22:45,314
How can it save you?

1438
02:22:47,187 --> 02:22:49,485
Look at that board.

1439
02:22:56,696 --> 02:23:03,158
Blasting would start in 3 minutes,
run to save your lives.

1440
02:23:13,213 --> 02:23:15,010
Bombs will go off, let's go.

1441
02:23:47,580 --> 02:23:50,549
We're lucky to get saved!

1442
02:23:50,750 --> 02:23:54,379
Father and son would've got killed!

1443
02:24:03,430 --> 02:24:07,890
The fear you wanted to see in my eyes,
l can see it in your eyes.

1444
02:24:08,435 --> 02:24:11,063
lt means your time is over.

1445
02:24:11,938 --> 02:24:14,566
All police personnel
can leave the place.

1446
02:24:15,442 --> 02:24:17,910
l don't have any enmity with you.

1447
02:24:18,445 --> 02:24:19,912
l don't want your children
to become orphans.

1448
02:24:20,113 --> 02:24:22,081
No need to fear them.

1449
02:24:22,949 --> 02:24:23,916
Go away!

1450
02:24:24,117 --> 02:24:26,745
Will you aim guns at him
or get suspended?

1451
02:24:26,953 --> 02:24:29,922
You can suspend only if you return
alive from here, come one guys!

1452
02:24:31,124 --> 02:24:33,422
Why are you leaving?

1453
02:24:34,961 --> 02:24:40,593
That's why we politicians trust
goons more than police.

1454
02:24:40,800 --> 02:24:43,769
Kill him boys!

1455
02:28:02,168 --> 02:28:05,968
Will you make Andhra Pradesh to shiver?

1456
02:28:06,506 --> 02:28:10,636
You wanted to see fear in my eyes
shredding me to pieces.

1457
02:28:18,685 --> 02:28:25,318
God gave everything to my family
but forgot to give one thing.

1458
02:28:27,026 --> 02:28:28,323
That's fear!

1459
02:28:49,048 --> 02:28:50,845
Though he did it wittingly
or unwittingly,

1460
02:28:51,050 --> 02:28:52,244
it's a crime,

1461
02:28:53,052 --> 02:28:55,350
l'll accept any punishment from you.

1462
02:28:57,056 --> 02:29:01,857
Age will give you experience
not make you wiser.

1463
02:29:03,396 --> 02:29:07,025
Will you accept any punishment?

1464
02:29:08,735 --> 02:29:09,702
l will accept.

1465
02:29:11,738 --> 02:29:17,699
To make your father's soul rest
in peace, you must enter the home.

1466
02:29:18,745 --> 02:29:24,547
as his heir, you must become
their leader and lead them!

1467
