1
00:00:51,264 --> 00:00:53,858
" Look what has happened
to my daughter, doctor"

2
00:00:54,468 --> 00:00:55,526
What has happened to Geeta?

3
00:01:10,817 --> 00:01:13,581
Geeta has been so ill and
you didn't even inform me

4
00:01:14,287 --> 00:01:17,381
l'm not a magician to wave a wand
and cure the patient immediately

5
00:01:18,525 --> 00:01:20,720
How was l to know that
it was such a serious disease?

6
00:01:21,228 --> 00:01:25,187
l thought it was just a fever.
- But you ought to have informed me

7
00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:29,391
" Before going abroad, Thakur saheb
entrusted the responsibility..."

8
00:01:29,469 --> 00:01:31,630
" of this family to me. lf something
goes wrong, what will l tell him?"

9
00:01:31,838 --> 00:01:33,738
" Munshiji, don't just stand
and watch my face"

10
00:01:33,807 --> 00:01:37,504
" Call the nursing home for oxygen.
... wait, l'll make the call"

11
00:01:37,911 --> 00:01:41,745
lmmediately send a cable that
Geeta is seriously ill...

12
00:01:41,815 --> 00:01:45,410
and that Thakur saheb must
return to lndia immediately

13
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:48,517
" My daughter will recover...
won't she, doctor?"

14
00:03:25,352 --> 00:03:26,341
Geeta...

15
00:03:36,429 --> 00:03:39,887
" l'm back, Geeta. l'm here"

16
00:05:09,623 --> 00:05:14,890
Wherever you set foot...

17
00:05:15,128 --> 00:05:20,088
My shadow will walk with you

18
00:05:31,244 --> 00:05:35,374
My shadow...

19
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:16,194
A memorial for Geeta

20
00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:44,820
lt looks like the lnspector

21
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,096
" Greetings, lnspector saheb.
- Greetings. How are you, Munshiji?"

22
00:09:50,403 --> 00:09:53,395
ls the Thakur saheb at home
- Yes. ls it something important?

23
00:09:54,107 --> 00:09:56,507
" Yes, it's important. lt's necessary
for me to meet him"

24
00:09:56,576 --> 00:09:58,771
But he doesn't consider it
necessary to meet anyone

25
00:09:58,845 --> 00:10:02,906
lt's like this...
- Ever since his wife died...

26
00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:05,481
neither does he meet anyone
nor does he go anywhere

27
00:10:05,551 --> 00:10:10,181
l know that. Just tell him
that lnspector Daljit is here

28
00:10:10,256 --> 00:10:13,692
That's no good. Neither can you
meet him nor can he meet you

29
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,219
" Greetings, lnspector.
- Greetings"

30
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:20,122
" Are you here to meet the Thakur?
- Yes, it's very important..."

31
00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:23,225
or l wouldn't have bothered you.
- l'm glad you have come

32
00:10:24,203 --> 00:10:26,728
He'll at least find a distraction.
Please come

33
00:10:39,686 --> 00:10:45,420
Missing me...

34
00:10:45,491 --> 00:10:50,155
should your tears ever flow...

35
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:55,558
Missing me...

36
00:10:55,635 --> 00:11:00,504
should your tears ever flow...

37
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:07,340
They will be stopped right there...

38
00:11:07,413 --> 00:11:11,679
by my tears

39
00:11:12,518 --> 00:11:17,922
Every place you head to...

40
00:11:18,157 --> 00:11:23,356
my shadow will move with you

41
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:28,933
Wherever you choose to go...

42
00:11:29,168 --> 00:11:33,798
my shadow will go with you

43
00:11:34,207 --> 00:11:36,198
This is how he has been

44
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,940
He's always gazing at Geeta's portrait
and listening to her song

45
00:11:40,713 --> 00:11:42,271
He just doesn't eat anything

46
00:11:43,182 --> 00:11:44,649
He prefers to remain like this

47
00:11:46,452 --> 00:11:47,441
Son...

48
00:11:55,528 --> 00:11:57,428
The lnspector wants to meet you

49
00:11:59,165 --> 00:12:00,462
Please sit down.
- Thank you

50
00:12:02,235 --> 00:12:03,600
Do you recognise her?

51
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:15,772
This is Geeta's photo. With you...?
- No. lt's not her photo

52
00:12:17,884 --> 00:12:21,786
Please listen carefully to
what l wish to say to you

53
00:12:23,556 --> 00:12:25,319
" Presently, we're dealing
with a very strange case"

54
00:12:26,259 --> 00:12:29,490
We recently had an encounter
with a gang of bandits

55
00:12:30,263 --> 00:12:32,288
" During the encounter,
two bandits were killed..."

56
00:12:32,832 --> 00:12:34,766
and a fleeing girl was arrested

57
00:13:05,131 --> 00:13:06,689
Arrest them! Don't let them escape

58
00:13:17,443 --> 00:13:20,173
" Does anyone of you recognise them?
- No, sir"

59
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,675
You needn't be afraid.
They're dead

60
00:13:23,716 --> 00:13:25,411
Don't be scared. Go closer
and take a look

61
00:13:26,452 --> 00:13:29,387
" What's there to be scared of?
- Forgive me, sir..."

62
00:13:29,455 --> 00:13:31,650
only the police don't know them

63
00:13:31,858 --> 00:13:34,656
" Or else, every child in the
village is scared of them"

64
00:13:35,895 --> 00:13:38,386
They're bandits from
Suryavar Singh's gang

65
00:13:39,132 --> 00:13:43,125
They're feared far and wide.
They've killed hundreds of men

66
00:13:43,336 --> 00:13:46,669
" But, sir... you have accomplished
only half the job yet"

67
00:13:46,939 --> 00:13:50,272
Why only half?
- You ought to have got their chief

68
00:13:50,676 --> 00:13:53,645
" lf he lives, he'll form another gang."

69
00:13:55,414 --> 00:13:56,540
There's nothing to be scared of

70
00:13:58,518 --> 00:14:00,145
They won't form a gang anymore

71
00:14:05,191 --> 00:14:06,180
Get down

72
00:14:14,634 --> 00:14:15,623
Move

73
00:14:24,844 --> 00:14:26,334
Anyone of you knows this girl?

74
00:14:31,117 --> 00:14:32,106
Anyone of you knows her?

75
00:14:36,122 --> 00:14:37,111
Raise the lamp

76
00:14:49,468 --> 00:14:50,457
l know

77
00:14:52,205 --> 00:14:53,399
Very well too

78
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:59,143
" At the Goddess's fair last year,
she was dancing near the temple"

79
00:14:59,912 --> 00:15:01,209
lt was night time

80
00:15:45,591 --> 00:15:48,151
My ear-ring fell down...

81
00:15:51,697 --> 00:15:54,131
My ear-ring fell down...

82
00:15:54,267 --> 00:15:56,861
at the marketplace in Bareilly

83
00:15:57,336 --> 00:15:59,361
My ear-ring fell...

84
00:15:59,438 --> 00:16:02,134
at the marketplace in Bareilly

85
00:16:40,846 --> 00:16:45,806
" My lover came home quietly,
with his gaze lowered"

86
00:16:54,226 --> 00:16:58,856
" He insisted on making me
wear the ear-ring"

87
00:16:59,298 --> 00:17:03,701
" l begged him and told him
not to force me"

88
00:17:04,337 --> 00:17:11,334
" l begged him and implored,
but he wouldn't let go of my wrist"

89
00:17:11,877 --> 00:17:12,866
What happened then?

90
00:17:13,112 --> 00:17:16,843
Then...? My ear-ring fell...

91
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,517
in the scuffle we had

92
00:17:19,685 --> 00:17:21,619
My ear-ring fell...

93
00:17:22,088 --> 00:17:24,716
" in the marketplace
at Bareilly"

94
00:17:53,219 --> 00:17:58,213
l once stood on the roof of my house

95
00:18:06,232 --> 00:18:10,760
He joked and told me to come down

96
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:15,704
" Either come down, or throw me
your ring as a souvenir"

97
00:18:16,442 --> 00:18:18,808
There on the roof...

98
00:18:18,878 --> 00:18:23,474
l blushed and felt so very shy

99
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,139
What happened then?

100
00:18:25,584 --> 00:18:28,883
The ear-ring fell...

101
00:18:29,121 --> 00:18:31,589
while we fell in love

102
00:18:32,091 --> 00:18:34,286
The ear-ring fell...

103
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,692
at the marketplace
in Bareilly'

104
00:19:05,157 --> 00:19:10,060
" ln the garden, my lover
sorted out my knotted tresses"

105
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:22,803
" He held me tightly and said
he was smitten by me"

106
00:19:23,275 --> 00:19:29,510
" l lowered my eyes,
but l said nothing..."

107
00:19:29,582 --> 00:19:33,746
" l said nothing,
l only smiled..."

108
00:19:34,487 --> 00:19:39,584
" when my lover teased me
we got into a fight..."

109
00:19:39,658 --> 00:19:41,649
there was a fight

110
00:19:41,894 --> 00:19:43,555
What happened then?

111
00:19:44,697 --> 00:19:49,600
" The ear-ring fell...
why must l say how"

112
00:19:50,102 --> 00:19:55,665
" The ear-ring fell in
the marketplace at Bareilly"

113
00:20:07,353 --> 00:20:09,719
She's a bandit! Don't let her go!

114
00:20:10,222 --> 00:20:14,318
She's no woman. She's a witch!
She's a slur on womanhood. A slut!

115
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,189
" Silence, Chaudhary!"

116
00:20:17,162 --> 00:20:19,323
" Constable, record
Chaudhary saheb's testimony"

117
00:20:19,865 --> 00:20:24,495
Seize and list the things from
where this woman was arrested

118
00:20:34,246 --> 00:20:39,377
She looks just like Geeta
- But she says she's Geeta

119
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:43,818
" You know my wife is...
- l know that very well, Thakur saheb"

120
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:47,555
But this woman has told the
police that she's your wife

121
00:20:48,561 --> 00:20:49,619
My wife...?
- Yes

122
00:20:50,262 --> 00:20:52,560
" lt's clear, Thakur Saheb"

123
00:20:53,265 --> 00:20:55,859
She bears a strong resemblance
to your wife...

124
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:59,894
and she's taking advantage of it.
She wants to enact this farce...

125
00:20:59,972 --> 00:21:01,303
and escape the noose

126
00:21:01,607 --> 00:21:04,667
So l've arranged an identification
parade at the police station tomorrow

127
00:21:04,843 --> 00:21:07,368
lf you could come there with
the people in your house...

128
00:21:07,446 --> 00:21:12,179
her lies could be exposed and
it would strengthen our case

129
00:21:20,526 --> 00:21:21,515
Open the door

130
00:21:25,331 --> 00:21:26,662
You... come here

131
00:21:27,866 --> 00:21:28,855
Yes. Come here

132
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:37,197
Go on

133
00:21:43,382 --> 00:21:44,371
Sit down there

134
00:21:54,226 --> 00:21:55,386
She looks just like Geeta

135
00:21:56,195 --> 00:22:00,154
" Whenever the mistress was upset,
that's how she always sat down"

136
00:22:02,534 --> 00:22:07,471
What's our mistress doing here?
- Moron! Are you high?

137
00:22:08,107 --> 00:22:10,234
" She's a bandit, the
mistress's look-alike"

138
00:22:10,409 --> 00:22:14,277
She wants to take the mistress' place
- Doesn't she have a place of her own?

139
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:18,414
Moron! You're going to sink me too!
Let's go

140
00:22:25,424 --> 00:22:28,484
l ask you one last time. Will you be
able to the recognise the Thakur?

141
00:22:28,794 --> 00:22:30,625
" l told you, l'm his wife"

142
00:22:32,197 --> 00:22:33,289
" Thakur saheb, please come in"

143
00:22:39,705 --> 00:22:40,694
Well?

144
00:22:42,174 --> 00:22:44,335
lt's not him.
- So who else is it?

145
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,299
l don't know

146
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,569
You may go

147
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:52,639
No 2

148
00:22:58,557 --> 00:22:59,888
lsn't that the Thakur too?

149
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,558
" You're lying! Who's he,
if not the Thakur?"

150
00:23:04,863 --> 00:23:08,765
How would l know. l...
- You said you are his wife!

151
00:23:09,168 --> 00:23:11,136
" lt isn't him, l say! lt isn't !"

152
00:23:14,106 --> 00:23:15,095
You may go

153
00:23:17,509 --> 00:23:18,498
No 3

154
00:23:26,485 --> 00:23:29,886
l'm glad you've come! Take me away!
Tell them that you know me

155
00:23:30,122 --> 00:23:32,215
Tell them that l'm your wife.
He thinks l'm lying

156
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:33,451
Am l not your wife...?

157
00:23:40,132 --> 00:23:43,329
" l was tired, waiting for you"

158
00:23:44,236 --> 00:23:46,136
l counted every passing moment

159
00:23:47,206 --> 00:23:51,905
l longed for you to come
and take me away

160
00:23:53,545 --> 00:23:54,569
Why're you so late...?

161
00:23:58,584 --> 00:24:02,179
Why're you looking at me like that?
What's wrong?

162
00:24:03,222 --> 00:24:07,124
lt's me... Geeta!
Your wife!

163
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:11,754
So Thakur saheb... is this woman
your wife? Or isn't she?

164
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:15,088
No

165
00:24:19,705 --> 00:24:22,674
No! Please don't leave me!
For God's sake!

166
00:24:22,741 --> 00:24:25,767
lt's me... Geeta!
l'm your wife

167
00:24:25,844 --> 00:24:28,335
" Please don't leave here.
For God's sake, take me away!"

168
00:24:28,514 --> 00:24:30,379
Listen...

169
00:24:30,449 --> 00:24:34,749
l can't live without you.
Please don't leave me

170
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,721
l'll die without you!

171
00:24:49,902 --> 00:24:54,168
" Aunt, don't you recognise me too?
lt's me... your very own Geeta!"

172
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:58,437
You aren't Geeta.
She never called me aunt

173
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:06,073
" Yes, l forgot. Everyone else
in the house called your aunt"

174
00:25:06,185 --> 00:25:08,119
" When l once called you aunt,
you rebuked me"

175
00:25:08,187 --> 00:25:10,314
You said l must call you Ma.
l started calling you Ma

176
00:25:10,489 --> 00:25:11,513
lsn't that right?

177
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:16,117
" Sargam, please say something!
Tell him that you know me"

178
00:25:17,396 --> 00:25:20,092
Remember? There hasn't been
a day in 3 years...

179
00:25:20,165 --> 00:25:22,633
when we haven't spoken in the day

180
00:25:23,902 --> 00:25:26,336
What are you looking at me for?
Tell him that you know me!

181
00:25:26,505 --> 00:25:28,200
Don't you recognise your mistress?

182
00:25:29,474 --> 00:25:33,672
My mistress was an angel. Don't even
utter her name with your filthy tongue

183
00:25:34,346 --> 00:25:38,305
" Come on, aunt
- Don't leave me here. Please!"

184
00:25:38,417 --> 00:25:40,715
Hear me out... l'm Geeta!

185
00:25:56,568 --> 00:26:02,234
" You know, Rakesh is always lost
in his wife's memories"

186
00:26:02,474 --> 00:26:06,342
That's right.
- Her funeral pyre...

187
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:10,211
" hasn't even cooled yet, and
you've started all this"

188
00:26:10,382 --> 00:26:13,476
l'm terribly sorry to have asked
the Thakur and you to come here

189
00:26:14,086 --> 00:26:17,783
" But believe me, l'm helpless too.
l must get over these formalities"

190
00:26:19,258 --> 00:26:25,219
l have a request. Please don't
call Rakesh here again

191
00:26:26,164 --> 00:26:28,758
l want him to overcome
his sorrow

192
00:26:29,768 --> 00:26:34,171
" lf you keep calling him here, he will
never be able to overcome his grief"

193
00:26:34,339 --> 00:26:36,671
" l'll do my best, believe me"

194
00:26:37,376 --> 00:26:39,105
l have all the sympathies
for the Thakur

195
00:26:39,711 --> 00:26:41,872
" As far as possible, l won't
ask him to come here again"

196
00:26:42,481 --> 00:26:44,642
Thank you. Good bye.
- Good bye

197
00:27:31,863 --> 00:27:35,799
The kohl in my eyes...

198
00:27:35,867 --> 00:27:39,234
shines like lightening

199
00:27:40,138 --> 00:27:47,135
" Embrace me please, my love"

200
00:28:32,257 --> 00:28:36,250
As if they hold intoxicating wine...

201
00:28:36,361 --> 00:28:40,195
my two eyes are full of mischief

202
00:28:55,414 --> 00:28:59,145
They shall keep hiding...

203
00:28:59,217 --> 00:29:02,778
behind my eye-lashes

204
00:29:03,555 --> 00:29:07,321
l shall feel shy...

205
00:29:07,392 --> 00:29:10,725
and give you an intoxicating look

206
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:05,475
l'm madly in love

207
00:30:06,118 --> 00:30:09,610
l'm the woman of your dreams

208
00:30:24,636 --> 00:30:28,766
" Coming from our
previous lifetime..."

209
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:32,469
l'm your beloved

210
00:30:32,944 --> 00:30:40,146
" Accept me as yours
in this lifetime too"

211
00:30:41,219 --> 00:30:45,155
The kohl in my eyes...

212
00:30:45,223 --> 00:30:47,919
shines like lightening

213
00:30:49,327 --> 00:30:56,324
" Embrace me please, my love"

214
00:31:41,746 --> 00:31:45,512
The Thakur has said it in plain words
that she's not his wife

215
00:31:47,586 --> 00:31:49,451
The proceedings in the court
begin tomorrow

216
00:31:51,256 --> 00:31:53,349
lt's necessary for us
to get to her

217
00:31:55,227 --> 00:31:58,253
Come what may

218
00:32:00,632 --> 00:32:04,534
What a nut you are! l told you l
didn't put my hand in anyone's pocket

219
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:07,904
You're here again...?
What has she done this time?

220
00:32:08,173 --> 00:32:12,132
" She put her hand in a man's pocket,
right outside our police station"

221
00:32:12,377 --> 00:32:15,244
" When he caught her at it,
she started abusing him"

222
00:32:15,547 --> 00:32:19,415
" Lock her up in the cell.
- This guy's blind, lnspector"

223
00:32:19,484 --> 00:32:22,112
" Ask him to put on glasses!
- Move it, old lady..."

224
00:32:31,396 --> 00:32:32,385
Get up

225
00:33:06,364 --> 00:33:10,300
Case No. 227.
State versus Suryavar Singh

226
00:33:11,836 --> 00:33:15,738
The charges levelled against you
will be read out to you

227
00:33:18,476 --> 00:33:22,879
You are charged for
colluding with bandits...

228
00:33:23,114 --> 00:33:25,105
" Ganga Singh and lshwar Singh
who fell to police bullets,..."

229
00:33:25,183 --> 00:33:28,516
" and Suryavar Singh, who is
a fugitive of the law..."

230
00:33:28,586 --> 00:33:34,491
with whom you formed a gang with the
intention of robbing and killing

231
00:33:34,726 --> 00:33:38,890
" On the night of January 24,
in village Alouni..."

232
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:43,658
you raided the liquor shop
of one Jhumarmal Paumal

233
00:33:44,402 --> 00:33:46,893
Under the pretext
of performing a dance...

234
00:33:47,138 --> 00:33:50,232
you and your gang assembled the
villagers at one place...

235
00:33:50,308 --> 00:33:53,368
and helped your other accomplices
to rob the place

236
00:33:53,712 --> 00:33:57,341
" Besides, you stabbed and wounded
the village chief with your dagger"

237
00:33:57,615 --> 00:34:04,544
" Under Sections of 1 20, 396 and 326
of the lndian Penal Code..."

238
00:34:04,622 --> 00:34:06,249
you will be tried in court

239
00:34:06,358 --> 00:34:08,485
l have concluded my arguments
in this case yesterday

240
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:13,156
l have even presented
the eye-witnesses

241
00:34:13,565 --> 00:34:16,295
" lf the accused has something to
say in defense, she may go ahead"

242
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:22,137
You have heard the charges
framed against you

243
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,431
Do you confess to your crimes?

244
00:34:27,512 --> 00:34:30,242
Please do not speak in gestures

245
00:34:30,782 --> 00:34:34,411
The court would like to
hear you narrate your version

246
00:34:38,523 --> 00:34:42,516
Do not be afraid. Until
your crime is proved...

247
00:34:42,594 --> 00:34:44,721
the court will consider you
innocent and blameless

248
00:34:45,563 --> 00:34:50,398
l once again ask you:
do you confess to your crime?

249
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:54,202
" No, l have not committed any crime.
l'm innocent"

250
00:34:54,939 --> 00:34:57,134
l'm not the woman against whom
these charges are being framed

251
00:34:57,642 --> 00:35:00,543
" l'm the wife of the renowned
lawyer, Thakur Rakesh Singh"

252
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:06,214
" Your Honour, Thakur Rakesh
Singh's wife is dead"

253
00:35:06,785 --> 00:35:09,652
Thakur Rakesh Singh was called to
the police station for identification

254
00:35:09,854 --> 00:35:13,381
And he stated there that
the accused is not his wife

255
00:35:14,125 --> 00:35:17,652
Let's concede that Thakur Rakesh Singh
does not take his woman for his wife

256
00:35:18,696 --> 00:35:21,096
But whether this woman
is indeed his wife or not...

257
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:25,296
" will be decided by this court,
not Thakur Rakesh Singh"

258
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:33,639
" lf you wish, you can appoint a
competent lawyer to contest your case"

259
00:35:35,513 --> 00:35:38,482
l've just said that my husband
is himself a renowned lawyer

260
00:35:39,317 --> 00:35:40,784
l don't need any other lawyer

261
00:35:43,721 --> 00:35:47,418
Thakur Rakesh Singh will come
to this court only as a witness

262
00:35:50,228 --> 00:35:52,753
lt's obvious that he cannot fight
this case for the accused

263
00:35:56,334 --> 00:35:59,167
Would you like to consult
another lawyer?

264
00:35:59,904 --> 00:36:00,836
No

265
00:36:01,272 --> 00:36:04,241
" You can present your own defense,
if you wish to"

266
00:36:04,843 --> 00:36:05,832
l'd like that

267
00:36:06,611 --> 00:36:08,101
Do you have any witnesses?

268
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,848
My witness is none other than
my husband Thakur Rakesh Singh

269
00:36:13,718 --> 00:36:16,516
lssue summons in the name
of Thakur Rakesh Singh

270
00:36:18,456 --> 00:36:23,359
You people are heartless.
My son is already suffering...

271
00:36:23,428 --> 00:36:28,491
and you want him to appear in court.
He has already said it...

272
00:36:28,566 --> 00:36:30,295
in the police station that he
does not know that woman

273
00:36:30,902 --> 00:36:35,100
And you bring summons for him.
- l can't help it. That's the law

274
00:36:35,507 --> 00:36:37,634
l only follow orders

275
00:36:38,743 --> 00:36:41,541
Where is the Thakur?
l must serve these summons to him

276
00:36:42,146 --> 00:36:44,512
He's in his room upstairs.
Follow me

277
00:36:46,484 --> 00:36:50,147
What was that woman saying
at the police station?

278
00:36:51,122 --> 00:36:55,582
She said she was our mistress.
- Wonderful

279
00:36:55,894 --> 00:36:57,555
" ln which case, we must
bring her home"

280
00:36:58,796 --> 00:37:03,062
Moron! Our mistress is dead.
- So who was she?

281
00:37:03,368 --> 00:37:07,566
She's a bandit.
- But she said she's our mistress

282
00:37:08,373 --> 00:37:10,534
That's because she wants to
take our mistress' place

283
00:37:11,175 --> 00:37:14,736
" We must help her then, isn't it?
- What nonsense!"

284
00:37:15,747 --> 00:37:18,079
The Thakur is lonely

285
00:37:18,683 --> 00:37:21,550
" lf she comes over, the Thakur
will be happy again"

286
00:37:22,887 --> 00:37:25,754
ldiot! How many opium pills
have you swallowed?

287
00:37:26,257 --> 00:37:29,090
Three.
- Have another and make a move

288
00:37:41,573 --> 00:37:44,133
What was the lady saying
in court?

289
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:46,899
Didn't you get it?

290
00:37:47,745 --> 00:37:49,178
Do you want me to explain?

291
00:37:50,214 --> 00:37:53,411
Suppose your father had died.
- Let him die

292
00:37:54,118 --> 00:37:58,145
And your Mom is young and rich.
- But she isn't

293
00:37:58,456 --> 00:37:59,445
Who?
- My mother

294
00:37:59,624 --> 00:38:04,425
Suppose she is. And someone claims
to be her husband. Then?

295
00:38:04,696 --> 00:38:07,529
l'd clobber the bastard...
- Enough! Enough

296
00:38:08,266 --> 00:38:09,858
Do you get it now?
So make a move

297
00:38:14,138 --> 00:38:17,574
Sargam...
- lt isn't a season for that!

298
00:38:17,875 --> 00:38:20,844
lt's time for this Sargam.
Take a look

299
00:38:29,187 --> 00:38:30,449
Munshiji...

300
00:38:32,657 --> 00:38:33,817
She's asking for me!

301
00:38:35,226 --> 00:38:36,488
Bankeji...

302
00:38:38,262 --> 00:38:39,695
Me too!

303
00:38:50,575 --> 00:38:52,566
We aren't so ignorant

304
00:38:53,244 --> 00:38:55,109
We'll find a way

305
00:39:01,786 --> 00:39:05,313
Where does she go from there daily?
- Let her go

306
00:39:05,857 --> 00:39:08,291
" This is where she'll
come back, isn't it?"

307
00:39:08,626 --> 00:39:10,355
And she'll say...

308
00:39:10,461 --> 00:39:11,723
Munshiji...

309
00:39:12,497 --> 00:39:15,057
" To me, she'll say, " Bankeji..."

310
00:39:16,134 --> 00:39:17,533
Now make your move

311
00:39:26,577 --> 00:39:30,513
" Munshiji, what was the lady
saying in court?"

312
00:39:34,485 --> 00:39:37,784
" Doctor, one spoonful of sugar?
- Yes, just one spoon"

313
00:39:43,428 --> 00:39:44,417
Right too

314
00:39:47,765 --> 00:39:52,293
" We get great tea at your place, sir.
What brand do you use?"

315
00:39:53,204 --> 00:39:54,796
l won't tell you the name.
- Why not?

316
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:57,503
lt at least brings you over somehow

317
00:39:58,776 --> 00:40:02,337
lt's good for my health to
spend some time with you

318
00:40:02,447 --> 00:40:05,348
Thank you.
- We get to discuss so many things

319
00:40:05,416 --> 00:40:07,384
Or it's the same old story
of crime and criminals

320
00:40:07,585 --> 00:40:10,645
" Believe me, l spend a whole day
standing in the court"

321
00:40:10,888 --> 00:40:15,257
" You're right, it takes patience.
l'm fed up with just one case"

322
00:40:15,827 --> 00:40:17,317
What are we to do with this woman?

323
00:40:17,729 --> 00:40:21,756
We've examined over a dozen witnesses.
And every kid in town knows...

324
00:40:21,833 --> 00:40:27,601
that the Thakur's wife is dead.
But this woman continues to say...

325
00:40:27,672 --> 00:40:31,164
that she's the Thakur wife.
She's just not scared

326
00:40:31,409 --> 00:40:36,142
Why would a woman who
isn't scared of bullets...

327
00:40:36,214 --> 00:40:40,548
" be scared of a lawyer's arguments?
- That's okay, lnspector."

328
00:40:40,685 --> 00:40:43,245
But she has made a very big mistake.
- What?

329
00:40:43,421 --> 00:40:47,289
She has got Rakesh Singh to attend
the court as her witness

330
00:40:47,525 --> 00:40:49,959
But she doesn't know what a great
lawyer she's dealing with

331
00:40:50,294 --> 00:40:53,752
lt'll be difficult for her
to face him even for 2 hours

332
00:41:11,549 --> 00:41:12,538
Come on

333
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:20,579
Rise

334
00:41:38,743 --> 00:41:39,732
Thakur Rakesh Singh

335
00:41:51,289 --> 00:41:55,225
" Say it on oath, " l will speak only
the truth and nothing but the truth"

336
00:41:55,893 --> 00:41:59,192
" l will speak only the truth
and nothing but the truth"

337
00:42:00,898 --> 00:42:03,492
Your name?
- Thakur Rakesh Singh

338
00:42:03,901 --> 00:42:05,425
Do you recognise the accused?

339
00:42:08,706 --> 00:42:09,695
No

340
00:42:10,508 --> 00:42:14,774
Take a careful look at her.
She claims to be your wife

341
00:42:15,246 --> 00:42:17,271
ls that true?
- lt's a lie

342
00:42:18,282 --> 00:42:19,408
My wife is dead

343
00:42:21,786 --> 00:42:25,654
So the accused's claim of being
your wife is not true?

344
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:29,416
The accused's claim is
absolutely false and baseless

345
00:42:33,497 --> 00:42:40,494
" What bigger proof do we need than
the witness, the accused flaunts..."

346
00:42:40,571 --> 00:42:44,837
who denies in no uncertain terms
that she's his wife?

347
00:42:47,345 --> 00:42:51,782
Which means that the accused
is indeed a killer and a bandit

348
00:42:52,216 --> 00:42:54,878
The charges pressed against her
are absolutely right

349
00:42:55,386 --> 00:42:56,876
l request the court...

350
00:42:56,954 --> 00:43:00,321
not to let the accused waste any
more of the court's precious time

351
00:43:05,096 --> 00:43:09,192
Would you like to question Thakur
Rakesh Singh to defend yourself?

352
00:43:16,407 --> 00:43:18,637
l have some questions for him

353
00:43:19,777 --> 00:43:22,769
l hope he will
answer them truthfully

354
00:43:23,381 --> 00:43:25,781
" l don't want to waste
time, Your Honour"

355
00:43:26,183 --> 00:43:29,380
Everybody knows that my wife is dead.
And l don't want anyone...

356
00:43:29,453 --> 00:43:33,787
to raise questions about my late wife.
lt would hurt my feelings

357
00:43:34,759 --> 00:43:38,593
" l tell you once again, Your Honour.
l don't know this woman"

358
00:43:41,332 --> 00:43:46,793
" Thakur Rakesh Singh, just as the
court gave you a patient hearing..."

359
00:43:46,871 --> 00:43:52,434
l wish to give this woman an
opportunity to present her defense

360
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:58,214
All you have to do is to answer
the questions she asks you

361
00:43:59,216 --> 00:44:00,774
What do you want to ask him?

362
00:44:04,355 --> 00:44:05,583
l want to know...

363
00:44:07,658 --> 00:44:11,560
l mean... what will l ask him?

364
00:44:12,163 --> 00:44:16,099
" Your Honour, l can't understand
what this woman wants to ask me"

365
00:44:18,169 --> 00:44:21,798
l want to know...
how is this possible?

366
00:44:22,707 --> 00:44:24,504
You can't do this

367
00:44:26,177 --> 00:44:28,839
l think she doesn't want
to ask me anything

368
00:44:29,313 --> 00:44:31,110
She's wasting the court's time

369
00:44:33,784 --> 00:44:38,551
You need not be afraid. Relax.
And ask him whatever you want to

370
00:44:39,256 --> 00:44:41,781
You will be given an opportunity
to have your say

371
00:44:47,565 --> 00:44:50,295
Do you remember...
- What?

372
00:44:51,435 --> 00:44:53,767
lt's three years since
we were married

373
00:44:54,405 --> 00:44:55,736
You were never married to me

374
00:44:56,474 --> 00:44:58,339
" Yes, it's three years
since l was married"

375
00:44:59,543 --> 00:45:02,444
Our wedding was held according
to vedic rites

376
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:06,809
So what's new? All weddings are
held according to vedic rites

377
00:45:08,185 --> 00:45:11,518
We were married on
the 7th of March

378
00:45:14,258 --> 00:45:16,226
l was married on the 7th of March

379
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:20,095
Why do you look away when
you answer my questions?

380
00:45:20,531 --> 00:45:23,796
Look at me when you answer me.
- l don't think that's necessary

381
00:45:24,301 --> 00:45:27,293
Just ask your questions. l'm
giving the court my reply

382
00:45:30,107 --> 00:45:35,306
" For the sake of your wife, you
don't even want to look at me"

383
00:45:36,247 --> 00:45:40,547
Think of how she looked

384
00:45:41,585 --> 00:45:45,385
You lovingly called her Geeta
and sometimes Geete

385
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:52,622
You could lay down your life for her.
You loved her with all your heart

386
00:45:54,165 --> 00:45:59,330
l implore you in her name.
Place a hand on your heart...

387
00:45:59,403 --> 00:46:02,201
and tell me... am l not the woman
you were thinking about?

388
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,571
Your wife... Geeta

389
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:12,139
Answer me... am l not the same woman?
Am l not?

390
00:46:18,155 --> 00:46:19,315
There's no doubt...

391
00:46:22,093 --> 00:46:24,391
that you look just like my wife

392
00:46:27,398 --> 00:46:32,267
Your face looks just like Geeta's

393
00:46:45,649 --> 00:46:50,450
Wherever you choose to tread...

394
00:46:50,521 --> 00:46:55,356
my shadow will walk with you

395
00:47:04,869 --> 00:47:06,564
My shadow...

396
00:47:29,193 --> 00:47:32,856
Missing me...

397
00:47:34,165 --> 00:47:38,192
should you ever shed tears...

398
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:53,382
" they will be stopped
from flowing..."

399
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:57,250
by my tears

400
00:47:58,322 --> 00:48:02,816
" Any direction you choose
to take..."

401
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:07,326
my shadow will follow you

402
00:48:07,765 --> 00:48:12,464
Wherever you go...

403
00:48:12,536 --> 00:48:17,200
my shadow will go with you

404
00:48:17,441 --> 00:48:19,204
My shadow...

405
00:48:41,532 --> 00:48:46,299
Should you be ever be sad...

406
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:50,466
l'll be sad too

407
00:49:00,718 --> 00:49:05,712
Whether you see me or not...

408
00:49:05,789 --> 00:49:09,520
l'll forever be with you

409
00:49:10,494 --> 00:49:15,158
Wherever you choose to go...

410
00:49:15,232 --> 00:49:19,828
my shadow will move with you

411
00:49:20,271 --> 00:49:24,799
Wherever you go...

412
00:49:24,875 --> 00:49:29,505
my shadow will walk with you

413
00:49:29,713 --> 00:49:31,408
My shadow...

414
00:50:33,210 --> 00:50:35,371
" Mr Lawyer, it's morning already"

415
00:50:37,414 --> 00:50:38,779
" Wake up, you've got to attend court"

416
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:45,345
Looks like you won't get up
on your own. l'll have to awaken you

417
00:50:52,529 --> 00:50:54,520
What are you doing?
- So wake up

418
00:50:57,868 --> 00:51:01,099
l'd say you go to sleep too.
- You have so much of work to do

419
00:51:01,238 --> 00:51:04,435
l'll do it at the next hearing.
- Next hearing indeed

420
00:51:06,176 --> 00:51:07,575
" You take the house for
your court, do you?"

421
00:51:08,112 --> 00:51:12,242
" Not the court, my love.
l take it for something else"

422
00:51:13,484 --> 00:51:16,578
What?
- A temple of the goddess of beauty.

423
00:51:17,688 --> 00:51:21,590
And you are the goddess.
- Stop flattering me

424
00:51:22,159 --> 00:51:24,650
" Wake up, your tea's getting cold.
- l don't want any tea"

425
00:51:25,629 --> 00:51:29,258
So what do you want to drink?
- What do they drink in the heavens?

426
00:51:32,269 --> 00:51:33,258
Nectar

427
00:51:34,238 --> 00:51:36,502
So let the nectar flow
from your lips!

428
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:40,276
ls the court on a holiday?
You're upto mischief in bed

429
00:51:40,744 --> 00:51:43,178
The court is working.
But l'm not going today

430
00:51:44,348 --> 00:51:47,181
What will you do all day
sitting at home like a woman?

431
00:51:47,618 --> 00:51:52,248
ln bed... l'll chat with you
- Shameless man!

432
00:51:53,357 --> 00:51:58,158
What will people at home say?
- She'll say you're so beautiful...

433
00:51:58,228 --> 00:52:00,162
you have me in your clutches
as soon as you've arrived

434
00:52:01,632 --> 00:52:03,862
Maybe that's why she suggested it.
- What?

435
00:52:05,202 --> 00:52:08,296
To visit the temple with you.
- You can go to the temple

436
00:52:08,806 --> 00:52:11,297
Why're you dragging me there?
- You don't understand

437
00:52:12,609 --> 00:52:13,598
So explain it to me

438
00:52:15,112 --> 00:52:17,706
To make a wish.
- To make a wish?

439
00:52:19,116 --> 00:52:20,208
You're so dumb!

440
00:52:24,321 --> 00:52:27,313
" You mean, to wish for a baby?
A little Thakur?"

441
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:32,527
But what has the junior Thakur
to do with the temple?

442
00:52:33,363 --> 00:52:36,127
That wasn't my idea.
Aunt Radha suggested it

443
00:52:37,167 --> 00:52:40,295
At aunt Radha's behest l married
you. So l'll go to the temple also

444
00:52:41,638 --> 00:52:43,936
You're so lovable!
- Did aunt say that too?

445
00:52:45,409 --> 00:52:47,502
" Don't ask me all that.
Just get up, will you?"

446
00:52:48,679 --> 00:52:51,147
" One little nap, okay?
Make some tea for me..."

447
00:52:51,215 --> 00:52:54,582
l'll join you in five minutes.
- lf you don't ...

448
00:52:54,651 --> 00:52:56,209
l'll pour cold water on you

449
00:53:15,572 --> 00:53:19,633
" Wake up, sir.
You've got to attend the hearing today"

450
00:53:22,246 --> 00:53:24,771
Where did you spring from?
Go and send your mistress

451
00:53:43,667 --> 00:53:47,228
" l don't know what to do, doctor"

452
00:53:47,604 --> 00:53:50,801
You see the condition of my boy.
- l do

453
00:53:51,441 --> 00:53:54,740
He stands glumly before
Geeta's picture...

454
00:53:54,811 --> 00:53:57,473
and spends hours at her memorial

455
00:53:58,215 --> 00:54:00,274
He shuts the doors and listens
to her voice for hours

456
00:54:00,651 --> 00:54:05,452
And this case has now begun.
What will he go through?

457
00:54:05,656 --> 00:54:07,487
Please don't worry.
l'll handle everything

458
00:54:08,592 --> 00:54:15,293
" Doctor, can't we send him away
somewhere? London, France... anyplace"

459
00:54:15,666 --> 00:54:18,134
Going away will take his mind
off these things

460
00:54:18,201 --> 00:54:22,160
He won't need to go anywhere.
This case is a false case

461
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:24,298
lt'll get over in a
couple of hearings

462
00:54:24,675 --> 00:54:26,472
Thieves can't get away

463
00:54:29,513 --> 00:54:33,381
" Mr Public Prosecutor,
you agree that this woman..."

464
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:37,181
resembles Thakur Rakesh Singh's wife?

465
00:54:38,522 --> 00:54:41,252
No one disagrees
that she's a look alike

466
00:54:41,725 --> 00:54:45,491
But she claims to be Thakur
Rakesh Singh's wife

467
00:54:45,829 --> 00:54:49,162
And we have proved that
his wife is already dead

468
00:54:50,133 --> 00:54:55,332
Anyone could have known what
you asked Thakur Rakesh Singh

469
00:54:56,206 --> 00:54:58,868
And it does not prove
that you're his wife

470
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:01,199
Very well

471
00:55:03,647 --> 00:55:07,811
l'll now ask him questions which
will prove that l'm indeed his wife

472
00:55:10,754 --> 00:55:17,091
" Remember, after our wedding, a part of
my sari was jammed in the car's door?"

473
00:55:18,128 --> 00:55:19,288
And you had it freed

474
00:55:21,665 --> 00:55:24,361
When our car had driven
far away from the city...

475
00:55:24,434 --> 00:55:27,267
" we saw the Moon, looking
beautiful in the skies"

476
00:55:28,672 --> 00:55:31,835
You would look at the Moon
and then at me

477
00:55:33,143 --> 00:55:36,544
You suddenly took my hand
and said...

478
00:55:38,181 --> 00:55:40,775
" O Moon, you are
going to be eclipsed"

479
00:55:42,185 --> 00:55:43,812
You will soon hide

480
00:55:45,522 --> 00:55:48,116
But the Moon here with me...

481
00:55:48,191 --> 00:55:50,421
" is the Moon which brings
love and happiness"

482
00:55:51,528 --> 00:55:53,325
" You stand no comparison
with her"

483
00:55:56,900 --> 00:56:02,065
ls that she says true?
- lt's true

484
00:56:04,675 --> 00:56:07,576
" All this is already published
in my novel " Sushma"

485
00:56:08,178 --> 00:56:10,305
She must've taken this extract
from that book

486
00:56:10,881 --> 00:56:17,116
" Thakur saheb, let's agree that
this girl has read your book"

487
00:56:17,521 --> 00:56:22,584
But how would she know that
this what you told your wife?

488
00:56:24,161 --> 00:56:28,120
My chauffeur was driving the car.
He must've spoken about it somewhere

489
00:56:30,467 --> 00:56:31,456
That's possible

490
00:56:36,106 --> 00:56:39,166
ls this hear-say too... ?
- What?

491
00:56:39,876 --> 00:56:42,868
That which l'm going to ask you.
- Go ahead

492
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:45,108
Do you go to the temple?

493
00:56:46,149 --> 00:56:47,138
No

494
00:56:47,751 --> 00:56:49,150
Have you never been to a temple?

495
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:51,209
Never

496
00:56:52,189 --> 00:56:54,248
" Oh yes, l remember"

497
00:56:56,126 --> 00:56:59,459
l went to the temple once.
- Who forced you to go there?

498
00:57:00,797 --> 00:57:01,786
My wife did

499
00:57:02,599 --> 00:57:06,535
Should l tell you how and why
your wife took you to the temple?

500
00:57:07,738 --> 00:57:11,834
" Since you remember everything,
you will also recall..."

501
00:57:12,075 --> 00:57:14,270
that l came to awaken you
that morning

502
00:57:15,078 --> 00:57:16,511
You wanted to sleep
for some more time

503
00:57:17,414 --> 00:57:22,147
" But l didn't agree.
l said, if you didn't wake up..."

504
00:57:22,219 --> 00:57:23,618
l'd pour cold water on you

505
00:57:25,355 --> 00:57:29,086
You forced me to sit down
and tried to placate me

506
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:33,721
lt was then that l got you to agree
to visit the temple

507
00:57:35,265 --> 00:57:36,254
Do you remember?

508
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:39,500
l remember it well...
because l'm your wife!

509
00:57:40,403 --> 00:57:42,166
Nobody except me could
know about this

510
00:57:42,873 --> 00:57:45,341
" Nonsense! Of course,
there'd be people who knew"

511
00:57:46,476 --> 00:57:50,674
Word about it had spread in the
locality and people laughed at me

512
00:57:51,515 --> 00:57:55,144
They had got to know that l had
been to the temple to pray for a son

513
00:57:56,620 --> 00:58:02,115
You have been asking him things
everybody would know about

514
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:07,553
Ask him something that must've
happened only between the two of you

515
00:58:08,231 --> 00:58:09,220
Take off your shirt

516
00:58:12,669 --> 00:58:14,398
" Take off your shirt, l say"

517
00:58:15,472 --> 00:58:18,703
l'll tell you something about
yourself which even you don't know

518
00:58:20,110 --> 00:58:23,511
" To the right on your back,
you have a mole"

519
00:58:26,149 --> 00:58:28,743
" What farce is this, Your Honour?"

520
00:58:29,586 --> 00:58:33,283
She's asking a decent man to take off
his shirt in packed courtroom!

521
00:58:34,191 --> 00:58:38,389
You ought to be thankful that he's
only being asked to take off his shirt

522
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:47,327
" Why should you object to take off
your shirt, Thakur Saheb?"

523
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:34,708
" You didn't employ a servant when
l was abroad, did you aunt?"

524
00:59:35,352 --> 00:59:36,341
" Not at all, son"

525
00:59:43,159 --> 00:59:45,423
" You haven't spoken about it after
your dose of opium, have you?"

526
00:59:47,797 --> 00:59:48,786
Please leave

527
00:59:49,833 --> 00:59:54,099
" l remember, sir. When you were away,
there's a burglary in the house"

528
00:59:54,170 --> 00:59:56,661
A burglary?
- Yes. But nothing was stolen

529
00:59:57,474 --> 00:59:59,203
What rubbish are you talking?
Go away

530
01:00:05,548 --> 01:00:07,345
" Aunt...
- Yes, son?"

531
01:00:09,219 --> 01:00:12,552
How could she have known that
l have a mole on my back?

532
01:00:17,327 --> 01:00:21,855
How did that woman get to know that
the boss has a mole on his back?

533
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:26,901
l didn't tell her.
- You're the best too!

534
01:00:27,337 --> 01:00:31,637
" When you're dead, l'm going to stuff
your body and keep it in a museum"

535
01:00:32,142 --> 01:00:33,905
l hope you and l will be together?
- Shut up!

536
01:00:46,256 --> 01:00:47,553
Bankeji...

537
01:00:53,229 --> 01:00:54,526
Munshiji...

538
01:01:05,542 --> 01:01:07,533
She's crying

539
01:01:08,478 --> 01:01:12,847
What else will the poor girl do?
She's so very sad

540
01:01:13,616 --> 01:01:16,346
Neither you nor l
pay her any attention

541
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:22,681
" She can't talk to herself, can she?
Youth is crazy, Bankeji. lt's crazy"

542
01:01:22,859 --> 01:01:26,693
So what are we supposed to do?
- That's just what l'm thinking about

543
01:01:27,163 --> 01:01:28,425
She calls out to both of us

544
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:34,600
That grace of hers...
- What's grace?

545
01:01:35,839 --> 01:01:39,775
lt's something girls possess.
- Not boys?

546
01:01:42,712 --> 01:01:45,613
Moron! How many pills
have you swallowed?

547
01:01:45,782 --> 01:01:48,580
None as yet.
- So have one now. And make a move

548
01:01:58,661 --> 01:01:59,650
Your move

549
01:02:02,365 --> 01:02:05,391
How did she get to know that
the Thakur has a mole on his back?

550
01:02:09,205 --> 01:02:13,301
How did she get to know that
the Thakur has a mole on his back?

551
01:02:14,778 --> 01:02:19,738
l give up. l've seen the
best of lawyers at work...

552
01:02:19,816 --> 01:02:23,513
but l haven't seen anyone twisting
things like this woman does

553
01:02:23,787 --> 01:02:28,383
" ln 25 years of my practice, l haven't
come across a more complicated case"

554
01:02:28,691 --> 01:02:31,387
" But it's so interesting,
l'm really enjoying it"

555
01:02:32,195 --> 01:02:36,131
" You're enjoying it, Mr Lawyer.
But think of the poor Thakur"

556
01:02:36,733 --> 01:02:42,501
He has lost his wife recently. And
there's a woman who lies in court...

557
01:02:42,572 --> 01:02:45,541
that l'm your wife!
lt would drive anyone mad

558
01:02:46,142 --> 01:02:48,235
" l've told you, Your Honour.
My wife is dead!"

559
01:02:48,445 --> 01:02:52,381
l don't know this woman!
- You do know me. And very well too!

560
01:02:52,682 --> 01:02:54,343
But you're refusing to recognise me

561
01:02:54,784 --> 01:02:56,877
Why don't you admit
that l'm your wife?

562
01:02:57,787 --> 01:03:00,255
Can't you understand what l'm saying?
Are you blind?

563
01:03:00,723 --> 01:03:03,783
" Are you blind, deaf, dumb...?
Here l am, right before you"

564
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:07,296
" And you say l'm not your wife!
- Yes, you're not my wife!"

565
01:03:07,430 --> 01:03:11,161
You're a cheat. An impostor!
You want to take my wife's place

566
01:03:11,434 --> 01:03:15,131
You want to torment her soul.
But l won't ever let you do that

567
01:03:15,472 --> 01:03:17,770
l'm not answering any questions.
This case is over for me!

568
01:03:17,874 --> 01:03:19,171
Thakur Rakesh Singh

569
01:03:19,843 --> 01:03:24,644
l can't be stern with you
because of your state of mind

570
01:03:25,148 --> 01:03:27,776
But should you do something
like this again...

571
01:03:37,694 --> 01:03:43,530
Can you throw light on how this girl
could know so many details about you?

572
01:03:46,436 --> 01:03:47,801
" l'm myself amazed, Your Honour"

573
01:03:50,173 --> 01:03:53,142
l can say nothing. Nothing

574
01:03:53,877 --> 01:03:59,338
" To prove the fact that l'm his wife,
l wish to present some evidence"

575
01:04:00,283 --> 01:04:01,307
What evidence?

576
01:04:02,185 --> 01:04:05,882
l'll give it to him.
lf the court permits...

577
01:04:06,122 --> 01:04:07,817
l'd like to meet him in privacy

578
01:04:09,192 --> 01:04:12,423
" This lady wants to meet you
in privacy, Thakur saheb"

579
01:04:12,762 --> 01:04:14,195
Do you have any objections?

580
01:04:18,134 --> 01:04:19,123
" No, Your Honour"

581
01:04:22,138 --> 01:04:23,127
l'll meet her

582
01:04:29,179 --> 01:04:30,703
" Please wait...
- What's up, lnspector?"

583
01:04:32,148 --> 01:04:34,776
The Thakur and the girl are
discussing something in privacy

584
01:04:35,185 --> 01:04:36,447
Please go in from that door

585
01:05:21,431 --> 01:05:25,765
The court would like to know what
you and she discussed in privacy

586
01:05:27,203 --> 01:05:32,436
She told me things only a wife
would know about her husband

587
01:05:33,409 --> 01:05:36,674
" Despite that, she can't be my wife"

588
01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:40,845
Because my wife breathed
her last in my arms...

589
01:05:40,917 --> 01:05:43,147
and l personally lit
her funeral pyre

590
01:05:44,153 --> 01:05:48,749
" lf she's claiming to be my wife,
she's lying and deceiving the court"

591
01:05:51,628 --> 01:05:57,589
" As you said, she told you things..."

592
01:05:57,667 --> 01:06:01,330
only a wife would know about
her husband

593
01:06:01,771 --> 01:06:03,398
How would you answer that?

594
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:09,744
The answer is that this woman
resembles my wife. She's a look-alike

595
01:06:10,179 --> 01:06:12,841
She's trying to take advantage of
that to avoid going to the gallows

596
01:06:13,516 --> 01:06:17,612
" But l wish to end this story
once and for all, Your Honour"

597
01:06:17,787 --> 01:06:22,656
" l wish to prove that this woman is
a cheat, a fraud... she's not my wife"

598
01:06:23,192 --> 01:06:26,719
l would therefore request the court
to allow me to cross-question her

599
01:06:27,597 --> 01:06:33,467
You are here as a witness. How can
you cross-question the accused?

600
01:06:33,803 --> 01:06:35,100
That's bad in law

601
01:06:35,471 --> 01:06:40,431
" l'm a lawyer too, Your Honour. l wish
to appear on behalf of prosecution..."

602
01:06:40,543 --> 01:06:42,704
so l can ask the accused
some questions

603
01:06:45,481 --> 01:06:48,177
Because this is a very strange
and complicated case...

604
01:06:48,918 --> 01:06:52,319
" l give you the permission,
in order to solve it"

605
01:06:54,724 --> 01:06:56,453
Court is adjourned till tomorrow

606
01:07:01,464 --> 01:07:06,834
lt was on this day that happiness
had come to this house

607
01:07:07,804 --> 01:07:09,567
Geeta came here as a bride

608
01:07:10,673 --> 01:07:12,766
The mansion was full of guests

609
01:07:13,710 --> 01:07:18,545
We used to celebrate this day
in such grand style every year

610
01:07:19,449 --> 01:07:22,213
We had so many guests
even last year

611
01:07:23,186 --> 01:07:26,815
The lady sang such a beautiful song
at the party

612
01:07:27,490 --> 01:07:30,084
And today... there's nothing

613
01:07:30,793 --> 01:07:34,524
" Neither do we hear her melodious
voice, nor her chirpy laughter"

614
01:07:35,498 --> 01:07:37,193
Everything is so lonely

615
01:07:38,501 --> 01:07:45,339
What must my boy be going through

616
01:07:53,149 --> 01:07:54,844
You're very fond of taking pictures?

617
01:07:56,819 --> 01:07:58,684
My camera just won't see reason

618
01:07:59,222 --> 01:08:03,386
" lt says, " Just take pictures
of this beautiful girl"

619
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:06,060
What will you do with
all these pictures?

620
01:08:06,662 --> 01:08:10,723
" A few pictures of
an arrogant beauty"

621
01:08:11,401 --> 01:08:14,234
" lt was what was found
after l died"

622
01:08:14,537 --> 01:08:17,734
Wow! So you're a poet too?

623
01:08:18,207 --> 01:08:19,799
l don't know what you're
going to make out of me

624
01:08:20,376 --> 01:08:23,174
" Darling, if l were a poet, l'd ...
- You'd what?"

625
01:08:24,113 --> 01:08:25,705
Would you say something like...

626
01:08:27,383 --> 01:08:31,479
" Lest the shadow of her eyelashes
pierces my heart"

627
01:08:31,687 --> 01:08:35,817
Wonderful! What next?

628
01:08:36,759 --> 01:08:40,593
" l tell the one
who lingers in my eyes"

629
01:08:40,730 --> 01:08:43,096
Excellent! That's wonderful

630
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:47,395
" What couplet would l recite,
if not this one?"

631
01:08:48,471 --> 01:08:49,460
You...?

632
01:08:50,473 --> 01:08:52,270
You'd say something like this...

633
01:08:52,675 --> 01:08:56,509
" The doe-eyed beauty
has stolen my heart"

634
01:08:56,612 --> 01:09:03,040
" The innocent looking,
fortunate one, has stolen my heart"

635
01:09:03,386 --> 01:09:05,786
The doe-eyed beauty...

636
01:09:05,855 --> 01:09:08,119
the innocent looking one...

637
01:09:08,191 --> 01:09:09,658
has stolen my heart

638
01:09:13,763 --> 01:09:17,699
" The doe-eyed beauty
has stolen my heart"

639
01:09:30,346 --> 01:09:33,076
Your voice resonates...

640
01:09:33,149 --> 01:09:36,607
like spring making its
way through the mountains...

641
01:09:36,686 --> 01:09:39,587
or pining for the love
on earth...

642
01:09:39,655 --> 01:09:42,624
a star from the skies descends

643
01:09:43,659 --> 01:09:46,150
You've pinched that one!
You ought to say...

644
01:09:47,697 --> 01:09:52,293
" She came smiling and swaying,
with her tresses open"

645
01:10:00,843 --> 01:10:05,439
" Even the nightingale pauses
when her anklets tinkle"

646
01:10:06,249 --> 01:10:10,652
" She entranced me with
innocent looking eyes..."

647
01:10:10,786 --> 01:10:16,691
The doe-eyed beauty...

648
01:10:16,759 --> 01:10:18,556
has stolen my heart

649
01:10:34,677 --> 01:10:36,941
" Every desire of hers,
shall be fulfilled"

650
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:39,214
No desire will l deny her

651
01:10:39,582 --> 01:10:41,607
l'm madly in love...

652
01:10:41,684 --> 01:10:43,811
how can l ever
get a hold on myself?

653
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:45,744
" Watch out, prisoner of love!"

654
01:10:46,923 --> 01:10:51,690
" Once she holds you captive,
you can't escape"

655
01:11:00,169 --> 01:11:04,572
" A million ties be severed...
but not this bond"

656
01:11:05,174 --> 01:11:09,873
" She has robbed me of my sleep,
making false promises to me..."

657
01:11:10,112 --> 01:11:12,512
The innocent looking one...

658
01:11:12,582 --> 01:11:17,519
" The doe-eyed beauty
has stolen my heart"

659
01:11:33,202 --> 01:11:34,191
Why're you silent?

660
01:11:34,270 --> 01:11:37,364
l don't know what l'm
going to say today

661
01:11:37,607 --> 01:11:41,134
l'm tongue-tied.
My voice is stifled

662
01:11:41,243 --> 01:11:43,234
You wouldn't say that
if you really loved me?

663
01:11:43,412 --> 01:11:44,401
What would l say then?

664
01:11:46,349 --> 01:11:50,479
" When she takes off
the veil before the Moon..."

665
01:11:59,161 --> 01:12:03,359
" the moon blushed in shame
and fell at her feet"

666
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:08,193
" The stars would wonder
what is wrong"

667
01:12:08,638 --> 01:12:12,369
The doe-eyed beauty...

668
01:12:12,441 --> 01:12:16,172
" a naughty girl
has stolen my heart"

669
01:12:16,545 --> 01:12:21,414
" A doe-eyed beauty,
an innocent looking girl..."

670
01:12:21,484 --> 01:12:25,784
has stolen my heart

671
01:13:33,656 --> 01:13:39,617
" Munshiji, she came and went away.
She didn't even call out to us today"

672
01:13:40,429 --> 01:13:45,457
You're a nut! lt's the man
who must make the first move

673
01:13:45,868 --> 01:13:48,359
We've got to find out whom
she really loves

674
01:13:49,171 --> 01:13:51,139
Suppose she chooses me?

675
01:13:51,507 --> 01:13:54,271
So what? Where d'you apply the butter?
- On the bread

676
01:13:54,343 --> 01:13:58,370
" That's it. You marry or l marry,
it's one and the same thing"

677
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:06,281
l've thought of something

678
01:14:08,157 --> 01:14:11,615
" Just swallow your pills.
lt isn't for you think, okay?"

679
01:14:11,827 --> 01:14:15,285
" What's wrong if l do, once in a while?
- All right, speak"

680
01:14:15,831 --> 01:14:20,131
" lf you like my idea, it ends the fight.
- Are you going to speak or not?"

681
01:14:20,202 --> 01:14:23,103
Sure l will. And we will
remain friends forever

682
01:14:24,173 --> 01:14:26,607
Won't you speak? Damn you!
- Right away

683
01:14:27,176 --> 01:14:30,236
l think we ought to
get married together

684
01:14:35,451 --> 01:14:38,648
Good idea. l love it

685
01:14:39,221 --> 01:14:41,155
We can share the expenses

686
01:14:42,191 --> 01:14:44,250
" You can bring the lentils,
l'll get the flour"

687
01:14:44,894 --> 01:14:48,386
" You buy her a salwar,
l'll get her a choli"

688
01:14:49,365 --> 01:14:52,926
You pay the rents and l'll
look after whatever else

689
01:15:18,828 --> 01:15:22,389
" Say it on oath. " l'll speak the
truth and nothing but the truth"

690
01:15:22,865 --> 01:15:26,164
l've only spoken the truth.
- Please repeat it after me

691
01:15:27,636 --> 01:15:31,367
" l'll speak the truth
and nothing but the truth"

692
01:15:34,677 --> 01:15:37,373
Your name?
- Geeta

693
01:15:38,614 --> 01:15:42,744
" Your name is Raina, not Geeta.
- My name is Geeta, sir"

694
01:15:43,652 --> 01:15:46,485
" Whatever your name is,
these proceedings are..."

695
01:15:46,555 --> 01:15:48,352
being carried out against you
in the name of Raina

696
01:15:48,691 --> 01:15:51,683
So you must answer
to the name of Raina

697
01:15:52,261 --> 01:15:54,286
Must l lie even after swearing
to speak the truth?

698
01:15:54,530 --> 01:15:59,695
" These are legal proceedings, you see.
- l'll do it, if you say so"

699
01:16:02,104 --> 01:16:04,698
My name is Raina

700
01:16:05,841 --> 01:16:08,708
This case against you has been
going on for a long time

701
01:16:09,378 --> 01:16:11,346
Why didn't you call
any of your relatives?

702
01:16:11,847 --> 01:16:13,542
l did.
- Whom?

703
01:16:14,483 --> 01:16:16,417
My husband. You

704
01:16:17,419 --> 01:16:21,651
You know l'm not your husband.
Do you have other relatives?

705
01:16:23,125 --> 01:16:27,459
" Did your wife have other relatives?
- l'm doing the questioning, not you"

706
01:16:27,630 --> 01:16:31,498
" Answer my question. Apart from the
husband, do you have other relatives?"

707
01:16:32,334 --> 01:16:38,500
She wants to know if your wife
had other relatives

708
01:16:42,878 --> 01:16:46,336
My wife was all alone.
Her parents were dead

709
01:16:47,116 --> 01:16:49,710
Did she have any brothers or sisters?

710
01:16:52,288 --> 01:16:55,348
Please note that and let
the proceedings continue

711
01:16:58,861 --> 01:17:02,262
lnspector Daljit Singh arrested you
from the hills of Lalgarh

712
01:17:02,531 --> 01:17:04,795
ls that true?
- Yes

713
01:17:06,068 --> 01:17:07,228
How did you get there?

714
01:17:08,637 --> 01:17:11,731
Some bandits had abducted me.
- So bandits had kidnapped you!

715
01:17:12,174 --> 01:17:15,735
Which means the bandits got
into your house quietly...

716
01:17:15,811 --> 01:17:19,679
" your servants were fast asleep,
you made no noise..."

717
01:17:19,748 --> 01:17:21,875
and you quietly left with
the bandits. ls that it?

718
01:17:23,152 --> 01:17:24,813
That's not how it was.
- So how was it?

719
01:17:25,854 --> 01:17:29,290
l had gone out of my house
when the bandits ambushed me

720
01:17:29,858 --> 01:17:36,195
They gagged me and carried me away.
- On which date did it happen? When?

721
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:39,324
The 16th of October.
- At what time?

722
01:17:40,202 --> 01:17:43,660
At 1 1 :30 p.m.
- So the bandits already knew...

723
01:17:43,739 --> 01:17:46,867
that you'd step out of the house
at 1 1 :30 on the 16th of October...

724
01:17:47,109 --> 01:17:50,374
and they'd easily abduct you.
- l don't know anything about that

725
01:17:52,514 --> 01:17:56,610
" All right. Now tell me, when you
were kidnapped by the bandits..."

726
01:17:56,685 --> 01:17:58,744
why didn't your family
report it to the police?

727
01:17:59,788 --> 01:18:03,246
You were abroad then.
- l was abroad...

728
01:18:03,325 --> 01:18:06,158
but your family was very much here.
Answer my question

729
01:18:06,462 --> 01:18:10,558
" When you were kidnapped, why didn't
your folks report it to the police?"

730
01:18:11,266 --> 01:18:15,100
l don't know anything about that.
- You don't know it. But l do

731
01:18:15,871 --> 01:18:20,069
The fact is that you are not my wife.
My wife was seriously ill then

732
01:18:20,142 --> 01:18:23,737
" Everybody at home was attending to her.
- No, that's a lie!"

733
01:18:24,246 --> 01:18:27,807
" lf this is a lie, what
is the truth? What?"

734
01:18:29,184 --> 01:18:31,618
Can you prove that the bandits
had indeed kidnapped you?

735
01:18:32,788 --> 01:18:35,120
" Do you have any proof, l ask!"

736
01:18:36,892 --> 01:18:41,090
l don't have any proof.
Where will l find the proof?

737
01:18:41,830 --> 01:18:46,699
" Of the bandits who kidnapped me,
two fell to police bullets"

738
01:18:47,269 --> 01:18:48,531
And one escaped

739
01:18:50,806 --> 01:18:54,173
The accused says two of her
accomplices fell to police bullets...

740
01:18:54,243 --> 01:18:56,609
and one isn't yet apprehended.
- They were not my accomplices!

741
01:18:56,912 --> 01:18:59,437
l have nothing to do with them.
l don't even know them!

742
01:18:59,815 --> 01:19:02,181
You don't know the ones you lived with?
- l didn't live with them

743
01:19:02,251 --> 01:19:04,276
You were part of their
robbery and pillage

744
01:19:04,353 --> 01:19:06,446
l did nothing of the sort.
- You know things about me you...

745
01:19:06,522 --> 01:19:10,083
aren't even remotely connected with.
- l'm connected in that l'm your wife!

746
01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:13,060
" You are lying!
- l have witnesses, and l'm lying?"

747
01:19:13,128 --> 01:19:14,823
" And you're not lying,
you have no witnesses!"

748
01:19:15,764 --> 01:19:18,062
l don't know anything...
l know nothing

749
01:19:18,634 --> 01:19:22,536
Except that l'm your wife.
l'm your Geeta... your Geeta

750
01:19:38,287 --> 01:19:39,413
lf you are my wife...

751
01:19:41,256 --> 01:19:42,280
lf you are indeed my Geeta...

752
01:19:44,326 --> 01:19:48,228
" you must certainly believe in duty?
- l do, you know that"

753
01:19:49,331 --> 01:19:53,461
" As a Hindu, you must also be
believing in our texts"

754
01:19:54,536 --> 01:19:56,333
l do.
- So tell me...

755
01:19:57,272 --> 01:19:59,263
" if you're a married woman, where
is your matrimonial necklace?"

756
01:20:02,744 --> 01:20:03,733
My matrimonial necklace...?

757
01:20:12,421 --> 01:20:13,683
When the bandits kidnapped you...

758
01:20:14,690 --> 01:20:18,490
were you wearing the necklace?
- No

759
01:20:19,728 --> 01:20:20,922
You claim to be a Hindu woman

760
01:20:21,630 --> 01:20:23,860
" And yet, you take off your symbol
of marriage when you go out?"

761
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:27,160
Can you tell the court
why you did that?

762
01:20:28,904 --> 01:20:30,633
l can't .
- Why not?

763
01:20:32,574 --> 01:20:33,563
Because...

764
01:20:36,445 --> 01:20:38,276
Because you don't have the necklace

765
01:20:38,380 --> 01:20:41,372
" Because you never had it,
nor will you ever have it"

766
01:20:41,617 --> 01:20:43,141
Because the necklace is with me!

767
01:20:57,533 --> 01:20:58,966
This is my wife's
matrimonial necklace

768
01:21:00,202 --> 01:21:03,569
lt's a practice to burn
the necklace with the body

769
01:21:05,274 --> 01:21:07,572
But l broke this age-old custom

770
01:21:09,211 --> 01:21:11,873
When people were carrying
my wife's body away...

771
01:21:13,315 --> 01:21:15,681
l took this necklace
off her neck

772
01:21:17,186 --> 01:21:22,522
" Because, without her, l had
no support in life"

773
01:21:24,126 --> 01:21:31,123
" And this necklace has been with
me every moment, ever since"

774
01:21:51,787 --> 01:21:53,778
l can prove that the
necklace belongs to me

775
01:21:53,956 --> 01:21:57,585
How?
- When my husband was going abroad...

776
01:21:57,793 --> 01:22:01,285
the necklace had snapped.
Nobody apart from my husband and l...

777
01:22:01,363 --> 01:22:06,767
knows about this. Taking the breaking
of the necklace as a bad omen...

778
01:22:08,136 --> 01:22:13,699
he was putting off his visit abroad.
l reasoned with him with all my love

779
01:22:14,676 --> 01:22:17,201
" As a result, he agreed
to go abroad"

780
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:22,439
He took the necklace to the goldsmith
and had it fixed immediately

781
01:22:37,332 --> 01:22:39,163
Don't do it.
- Guess who it is

782
01:22:39,434 --> 01:22:42,926
l know. Let go.
- Utter my name first

783
01:22:44,940 --> 01:22:45,929
Gangu!

784
01:22:47,909 --> 01:22:48,898
" Kalwa, the laundryman"

785
01:22:50,545 --> 01:22:51,603
l don't know

786
01:22:52,948 --> 01:22:55,746
" Don't you know, really...?
- Spare me, Thakur Saheb!"

787
01:22:56,251 --> 01:22:58,913
You utter my name at last.
But half of it actually

788
01:22:59,388 --> 01:23:02,118
You're so shameless! What if
someone sees us?

789
01:23:02,491 --> 01:23:04,891
" You've done it, my love.
You bought me out"

790
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:09,160
l could even say that in court.
- You're late...

791
01:23:09,264 --> 01:23:10,856
and you're using sweet words

792
01:23:11,366 --> 01:23:14,267
l do all the slavery and
yet listen to your taunts

793
01:23:14,403 --> 01:23:15,893
What slavery have you done for me?

794
01:23:17,839 --> 01:23:20,239
Here you are!
- ls it fixed?

795
01:23:20,309 --> 01:23:24,473
Now tell me where it snapped.
- l can't tell!

796
01:23:25,747 --> 01:23:29,308
But l'm not going abroad.
- There you go again

797
01:23:29,551 --> 01:23:33,248
You don't know. The breaking of the
matrimonial necklace is a bad omen

798
01:23:33,422 --> 01:23:35,253
As if you ever believe
in such things?

799
01:23:35,791 --> 01:23:38,225
l've got to beg to you
to visit a temple

800
01:23:38,727 --> 01:23:42,185
You must go abroad.
- On one condition. Come closer

801
01:23:44,566 --> 01:23:45,794
You're going with me

802
01:23:47,169 --> 01:23:49,137
Your studies are all over then

803
01:23:50,906 --> 01:23:53,875
Ask him. ls this true?
Or isn't it?

804
01:23:54,476 --> 01:23:57,673
" Well, Thakur Saheb?
ls what the accused says, true?"

805
01:24:03,685 --> 01:24:04,674
She's right

806
01:24:09,424 --> 01:24:11,392
Court is adjourned till tomorrow

807
01:24:18,263 --> 01:24:21,232
" lnspector, if science had not
made such progress..."

808
01:24:21,299 --> 01:24:24,325
" l'd have told you that she isn't
a woman, she's a spirit"

809
01:24:25,236 --> 01:24:29,570
How did the necklace snap?
And where was it fixed?

810
01:24:30,442 --> 01:24:32,535
When was the Thakur supposed
to leave for abroad...

811
01:24:32,811 --> 01:24:35,371
" it's amazing, she has
all the answers!"

812
01:24:35,547 --> 01:24:39,483
" That's okay, but l don't find
anything amazing about that"

813
01:24:40,251 --> 01:24:42,981
When servants in the family
mingle outside...

814
01:24:43,221 --> 01:24:45,280
the tiniest of things
is not a secret anymore

815
01:24:45,590 --> 01:24:48,718
" For example, we have about
four or five goldsmiths in town"

816
01:24:48,827 --> 01:24:51,853
" She must've asked one of them.
- l believe, lnspector..."

817
01:24:51,930 --> 01:24:54,990
that woman is a ghost!
- Munshiji

818
01:24:55,433 --> 01:24:59,426
" Believe me, sir.
l'll tell you a true story"

819
01:24:59,971 --> 01:25:05,568
lt happened in my own village.
There was this beautiful woman...

820
01:25:05,643 --> 01:25:10,546
" who married a wrestler. She lived with
him for years, bore him children..."

821
01:25:10,615 --> 01:25:12,742
and it was discovered that
she wasn't a woman at all

822
01:25:13,685 --> 01:25:14,652
She was a demoness

823
01:25:21,593 --> 01:25:25,927
" To be honest, l have all
the sympathies for the Thakur"

824
01:25:26,698 --> 01:25:32,193
" To begin with, he has lost his wife.
And from morning to evening..."

825
01:25:32,270 --> 01:25:36,673
he's faced by a woman
who looks just like his wife

826
01:25:38,309 --> 01:25:41,972
God alone knows what
he's going through

827
01:26:46,444 --> 01:26:49,277
Forgotten tales...

828
01:26:52,984 --> 01:26:55,782
l'm recall again

829
01:26:59,390 --> 01:27:04,259
Wherever you walk...

830
01:27:04,329 --> 01:27:08,993
my shadow will walk with you

831
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:13,896
Wherever you tread...

832
01:27:13,972 --> 01:27:18,534
my shadow will walk with you

833
01:27:18,776 --> 01:27:20,471
My shadow...

834
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:46,961
Missing me...

835
01:27:47,505 --> 01:27:51,737
should you ever shed tears...

836
01:28:02,286 --> 01:28:06,313
they will be stopped....

837
01:28:07,025 --> 01:28:11,223
by my tears

838
01:28:11,996 --> 01:28:15,864
Any direction you choose...

839
01:28:16,434 --> 01:28:21,394
my shadow will walk with you

840
01:28:55,573 --> 01:28:59,976
Should you ever be sad...

841
01:29:00,211 --> 01:29:04,443
l'll be sad too

842
01:29:14,525 --> 01:29:19,258
Whether you see me or not...

843
01:29:19,430 --> 01:29:23,423
l shall always be with you

844
01:29:24,268 --> 01:29:29,171
Wherever you go...

845
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:33,734
my shadow will walk with you

846
01:29:34,378 --> 01:29:38,712
Wherever you tread...

847
01:29:38,783 --> 01:29:43,379
my shadow will walk with you

848
01:29:49,227 --> 01:29:52,424
A forgotten story...

849
01:29:52,497 --> 01:29:54,727
l now recall

850
01:30:08,412 --> 01:30:12,473
l'm amazed how that woman
could even think of it

851
01:30:12,817 --> 01:30:14,409
Whether she achieves something or not
from her line of defense...

852
01:30:14,485 --> 01:30:17,613
she'll surely get the
benefit of doubt

853
01:30:17,889 --> 01:30:22,519
l don't think it has happened suddenly.
lt's a well-planned conspiracy

854
01:30:22,894 --> 01:30:25,488
They get to know every detail
about his family

855
01:30:25,763 --> 01:30:29,665
Maybe you're right. But who
lets them into the details?

856
01:30:32,403 --> 01:30:35,201
Before or after you went abroad...

857
01:30:35,273 --> 01:30:40,301
did you employ someone new
or have a guest at the house?

858
01:30:41,946 --> 01:30:42,935
No

859
01:30:43,548 --> 01:30:48,417
Surprising. She talks
so confidently about you...

860
01:30:48,486 --> 01:30:51,580
as if your life were an open book
for her

861
01:30:56,928 --> 01:30:57,917
A book...?

862
01:31:03,601 --> 01:31:07,002
Hurry up. The master's angry.
He's turning everything upside down...

863
01:31:07,238 --> 01:31:09,433
looking for something.
- Let's go

864
01:31:18,783 --> 01:31:19,772
What's all this?

865
01:31:21,519 --> 01:31:25,250
" What happened, son?
- l can't find the diary! Where is it?"

866
01:31:25,456 --> 01:31:27,754
Which diary?
- Geeta's diary

867
01:31:28,559 --> 01:31:31,960
The diary she wrote every day.
- l don't know son

868
01:31:32,797 --> 01:31:35,630
Has someone touched Geeta's things?
- No

869
01:31:36,267 --> 01:31:40,601
Nobody has touched her belongings.
Everything is as it was

870
01:31:40,972 --> 01:31:42,234
Then where is the diary?

871
01:31:45,243 --> 01:31:50,408
" l told you, sir. There was a burglary
in the house, when you were abroad"

872
01:31:50,748 --> 01:31:56,812
Maybe the diary was stolen...
- Yes. You're right

873
01:31:58,289 --> 01:31:59,722
That's when the diary
must've been stolen

874
01:32:04,295 --> 01:32:05,762
That woman has the diary

875
01:32:06,797 --> 01:32:12,429
" No wonder she knows so much
about me, my house and Geeta"

876
01:32:12,937 --> 01:32:15,371
She knows it all

877
01:32:34,292 --> 01:32:36,226
lt's two years since we were married

878
01:32:36,928 --> 01:32:43,390
But my husband loves me as much as
he did on the day of our marriage

879
01:32:43,467 --> 01:32:45,901
What are you doing? lt's wrong
to read a personal diary!

880
01:32:45,970 --> 01:32:48,438
Give my diary to me.
- One moment... listen to me

881
01:32:50,207 --> 01:32:53,335
You're mine. And so's the diary.
So why not read what's mine?

882
01:32:53,411 --> 01:32:55,538
Please give me my diary.
l'm not going to fall for the trap

883
01:32:55,613 --> 01:32:59,913
Since when are you writing the diary?
- l always wrote it

884
01:33:00,284 --> 01:33:02,775
Did you? l caught you today

885
01:33:03,587 --> 01:33:06,647
Let me see what my wife
has to say about me

886
01:33:06,724 --> 01:33:08,214
Don't bother me! Give that to me.

887
01:33:15,733 --> 01:33:20,466
" l wonder what good deeds l have done
that my husband loves me so much..."

888
01:33:22,373 --> 01:33:23,431
so much...

889
01:33:24,275 --> 01:33:27,301
he takes my breath away
... Really?

890
01:33:29,513 --> 01:33:32,812
" l have an idiot for a husband
- Have l written " idiot" ?"

891
01:33:33,284 --> 01:33:37,448
Anyone who loves his wife so much
is considered to be an idiot

892
01:33:37,755 --> 01:33:41,657
l only made a correction.
- ldiot is fine. Write it too

893
01:33:42,159 --> 01:33:44,719
" l will, after l've read
what you've written here"

894
01:33:45,429 --> 01:33:47,727
" He's going abroad for
further studies tomorrow"

895
01:33:48,265 --> 01:33:51,928
l'm so happy... l can't describe it

896
01:33:52,803 --> 01:33:55,294
" He wasn't willing to go.
l forced him to"

897
01:33:55,606 --> 01:33:57,267
So you forced me?

898
01:33:59,777 --> 01:34:04,339
" l want him to be a great lawyer
so the world respects him"

899
01:34:04,849 --> 01:34:07,317
" l'm happy, and l'm sad too"

900
01:34:08,552 --> 01:34:12,420
" l've never been separated from him
after our marriage"

901
01:34:13,224 --> 01:34:14,282
Not even for a moment

902
01:34:15,226 --> 01:34:19,390
" For a whole year, he's going away.
Miles away from me"

903
01:34:20,231 --> 01:34:24,565
" How will l bear the separation?
How will l reason with my heart?"

904
01:34:32,576 --> 01:34:36,376
Are you really going?
For a year?

905
01:34:37,481 --> 01:34:41,645
" A year's nothing, Geeta.
l'll come back before you realise it"

906
01:35:20,524 --> 01:35:23,459
Whatever you have stated
in this court till now...

907
01:35:23,527 --> 01:35:27,224
goes to prove that you're my wife

908
01:35:27,898 --> 01:35:30,230
l've always said that l'm your wife

909
01:35:30,634 --> 01:35:32,295
Let's suppose you are my wife

910
01:35:33,270 --> 01:35:36,603
" Remember, you used to write a diary?
- Yes, l do"

911
01:35:37,308 --> 01:35:41,768
" You used to write in the diary about
every incident, big and small?"

912
01:35:42,379 --> 01:35:45,542
" Yes, l used to write the
tiniest of things in the diary"

913
01:35:46,484 --> 01:35:50,215
You also wrote about the
love between you and me?

914
01:35:51,489 --> 01:35:52,478
Yes

915
01:35:52,623 --> 01:35:57,219
All those things about me which
you have stated in court...

916
01:35:57,294 --> 01:36:01,230
" ought to be in the diary too?
- Yes, l wrote that too"

917
01:36:01,499 --> 01:36:06,368
You used to take such
good care of the diary...

918
01:36:06,437 --> 01:36:07,927
you wouldn't even let me touch it

919
01:36:08,305 --> 01:36:09,897
Right?
- Absolutely

920
01:36:10,374 --> 01:36:14,401
" lf you really valued the diary so much,
if you kept it so safely..."

921
01:36:14,478 --> 01:36:18,380
it means you must still be having
the diary with you. Right?

922
01:36:27,358 --> 01:36:28,791
" You're my wife, aren't you?
- Yes"

923
01:36:29,593 --> 01:36:31,356
You loved the diary.
- Yes

924
01:36:31,795 --> 01:36:33,956
You kept it very secure.
- Yes

925
01:36:34,365 --> 01:36:37,300
Which means you ought to have
the diary right now too

926
01:36:42,506 --> 01:36:47,307
" Try and recall... the
diary's with you, isn't it?"

927
01:36:48,646 --> 01:36:49,635
Why don't you speak?

928
01:36:50,848 --> 01:36:51,837
Where is it?

929
01:36:52,283 --> 01:36:55,684
" When l left the house, l didn't
carry the diary with me"

930
01:36:56,453 --> 01:36:58,683
So it must've been at home then?
- Yes

931
01:36:58,756 --> 01:37:01,623
" lt ought to be at home right now?
- Certainly, it should"

932
01:37:01,725 --> 01:37:02,714
So where is it?

933
01:37:03,794 --> 01:37:05,523
ln my safe
- No

934
01:37:06,297 --> 01:37:07,924
Maybe on top of the cupboard.
- No

935
01:37:09,266 --> 01:37:11,359
" ln my suitcase then...
- No, no, no!"

936
01:37:12,303 --> 01:37:15,170
l've searched every inch of the house

937
01:37:15,239 --> 01:37:17,605
" Cupboards, suitcases and trunks...
l've ripped all of them"

938
01:37:17,708 --> 01:37:19,767
But there's no trace of the diary

939
01:37:19,977 --> 01:37:23,469
That's where l kept the diary.
- That's what l want to know. Where?

940
01:37:23,814 --> 01:37:26,647
Where did you keep it?
- l don't remember

941
01:37:26,817 --> 01:37:28,944
You don't remember! You don't !

942
01:37:29,453 --> 01:37:34,948
You loved it more than your life.
You always kept it with you

943
01:37:35,459 --> 01:37:37,518
And you can't remember
where you kept it?

944
01:37:38,262 --> 01:37:41,425
l'll tell you why you can't remember.
lt's because you are not my wife!

945
01:37:42,766 --> 01:37:44,700
No...

946
01:37:45,236 --> 01:37:47,761
That's right! You are not my wife!
You are not!

947
01:37:48,606 --> 01:37:51,666
You are a fraud! You came
as a dancer to the village...

948
01:37:51,742 --> 01:37:53,801
you are the one who
attacked Patel with a knife

949
01:37:53,944 --> 01:37:55,707
You were the one who
stole at my house

950
01:37:55,946 --> 01:37:59,438
You stole my wife's diary and got
to know every secret of my life!

951
01:37:59,883 --> 01:38:02,351
You are my wife's look-alike.
You look just like her

952
01:38:02,486 --> 01:38:05,887
You're taking advantage of that
to save yourself from the gallows...

953
01:38:05,956 --> 01:38:08,925
you're playing with my life!
You want to take my wife's place

954
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:13,259
" Today, however, l taken
the mask off your face"

955
01:38:14,031 --> 01:38:17,159
You are exposed. You can't fool
the court anymore

956
01:38:17,234 --> 01:38:18,895
You can't pull wool
over the law's eyes

957
01:38:19,570 --> 01:38:23,836
l have proved it in court today...
that you are not my wife

958
01:38:24,241 --> 01:38:27,506
You are a bandit! A murderer!
A killer!

959
01:38:46,730 --> 01:38:49,426
Yes! l'm a killer! A murderer!

960
01:38:49,633 --> 01:38:51,863
A bandit. A bloody bandit!

961
01:38:52,236 --> 01:38:54,466
l'm going to shoot all of you

962
01:38:56,340 --> 01:38:57,705
l'm going to kill everyone

963
01:39:00,844 --> 01:39:02,573
Let me go...

964
01:39:05,015 --> 01:39:06,949
but please don't kill him

965
01:39:07,017 --> 01:39:08,006
don't kill him!

966
01:39:09,286 --> 01:39:11,220
He's the one l love

967
01:39:11,555 --> 01:39:13,352
He's innocent!

968
01:40:48,986 --> 01:40:55,824
" To you l come...
and l weep"

969
01:41:04,201 --> 01:41:10,436
" My tale of woes l narrate...
and l cry"

970
01:41:11,308 --> 01:41:17,508
" To you come l come...
and l weep"

971
01:41:33,330 --> 01:41:40,327
" Whenever l have been
lonely in life..."

972
01:41:48,245 --> 01:41:54,707
" you are my goal,
to you, l come"

973
01:41:55,619 --> 01:42:01,854
" l lower my head...
and l weep"

974
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:09,263
" To you l come...
and l weep"

975
01:42:19,776 --> 01:42:26,306
" Whenever l faced
a tearful evening..."

976
01:42:34,358 --> 01:42:40,957
" whenever a pall of gloom
descended everywhere..."

977
01:42:42,266 --> 01:42:48,432
" l lit lamps of my memories...
and l wept"

978
01:42:49,540 --> 01:42:55,638
" To you, l come,
and l weep"

979
01:43:15,933 --> 01:43:22,600
" This sorrow of separation
l can no longer bear"

980
01:43:30,647 --> 01:43:32,478
Without you...

981
01:43:32,549 --> 01:43:36,952
l can no longer live

982
01:43:38,188 --> 01:43:44,149
" l have lost so much in love.
l weep"

983
01:43:45,162 --> 01:43:51,499
" l weep, as l narrate
my tale of woes"

984
01:43:52,202 --> 01:43:58,607
" To you l come...
and l weep"

985
01:44:01,979 --> 01:44:04,812
Your name Sardarji?
- l'm Ranjit Singh

986
01:44:04,915 --> 01:44:08,373
He's Chaudhary Karnail Singh.
- Where are you coming from?

987
01:44:08,585 --> 01:44:11,452
" What a question!
From my house, of course"

988
01:44:11,688 --> 01:44:16,955
" Which city are you from?
- Tarn Taran, district Amritsar"

989
01:44:18,261 --> 01:44:21,355
Please sign here.
- l don't know to sign

990
01:44:21,598 --> 01:44:24,658
" l'm a farmer. l've sold my produce
and here l am, sight-seeing"

991
01:44:24,768 --> 01:44:27,601
l can put my thumb-impression.
- Please

992
01:44:28,338 --> 01:44:31,205
Where...?
- Here

993
01:44:33,477 --> 01:44:35,741
Keys for Room No. 10
- Which way?

994
01:44:35,912 --> 01:44:37,675
Show the gentleman the room.
- Let's go

995
01:44:45,856 --> 01:44:50,657
" l bet, the Thakur will someday be
one of the best lawyer in lndia"

996
01:44:50,761 --> 01:44:53,662
You're right.
- What a turn he gave this case

997
01:44:53,730 --> 01:44:57,222
He has turned it on its head.
- During his argument...

998
01:44:57,300 --> 01:45:00,997
he convinces the culprit that he
has weakened and has lost the case

999
01:45:01,304 --> 01:45:04,569
" The twist the case takes thereafter,
the accused is left stunned"

1000
01:45:04,641 --> 01:45:06,632
Not just stunned.
The accused goes mad

1001
01:45:06,943 --> 01:45:10,709
" Take this woman, for instance.
Remember l told you...?"

1002
01:45:10,781 --> 01:45:14,239
This woman has made a mistake by
summoning the Thakur to the court

1003
01:45:14,284 --> 01:45:16,343
And where is she now?
ln the mental hospital

1004
01:45:16,486 --> 01:45:19,182
How is she now?
- The doctors say it's a...

1005
01:45:19,256 --> 01:45:22,316
temporary phase. She'll be all right.
- And what happens to her?

1006
01:45:22,392 --> 01:45:23,757
That which must happen to her

1007
01:45:24,361 --> 01:45:27,455
She has admitted it in court
that she's a bandit

1008
01:45:27,998 --> 01:45:30,432
" You mean, she'll be hanged?"

1009
01:45:33,270 --> 01:45:40,267
" Doctor, are you going to hang me?
When will you hang me?"

1010
01:45:40,911 --> 01:45:42,640
Hang you? What for?

1011
01:45:43,613 --> 01:45:47,572
Nobody's going to hang you.
- But l want to die

1012
01:45:48,618 --> 01:45:50,347
As soon as possible

1013
01:45:52,689 --> 01:45:55,624
" But before l die, l want
to meet my husband once"

1014
01:45:57,728 --> 01:45:59,389
He's a very nice man

1015
01:45:59,930 --> 01:46:03,297
Sure. do meet him.
l'll see that you meet him

1016
01:46:03,834 --> 01:46:08,328
" l want to meet him just once.
Before l'm hanged, just once"

1017
01:46:15,746 --> 01:46:20,206
" Where's my diary, doctor?
Where is my diary?"

1018
01:46:20,450 --> 01:46:23,180
l want my diary! My husband
thinks l'm a fake

1019
01:46:23,420 --> 01:46:25,615
He won't let me go home.
He won't talk to me!

1020
01:46:25,822 --> 01:46:28,382
" l want to go to him, doctor...
where is my diary?"

1021
01:46:28,592 --> 01:46:30,958
Where is it? l want my diary...

1022
01:46:31,194 --> 01:46:34,254
Relax... sit down

1023
01:46:35,665 --> 01:46:36,723
You will have your diary

1024
01:46:39,302 --> 01:46:43,398
l think she can be cured.
And very fast at that

1025
01:46:44,674 --> 01:46:45,868
Here's what l want you to do

1026
01:46:57,621 --> 01:47:02,251
We're walking into the jaws of death.
The place is swarming with cops...

1027
01:47:02,325 --> 01:47:07,228
and there's a reward on your head.
lt's not easy to get to her

1028
01:47:07,631 --> 01:47:09,531
And what will we achieve
even if we get to her?

1029
01:47:10,233 --> 01:47:14,499
We can't help her in any way.
We'll get caught too

1030
01:47:14,571 --> 01:47:17,199
Shut up! You guys are worried
about your own skin

1031
01:47:18,942 --> 01:47:23,845
You don't see how many people
that lone woman is taking on

1032
01:47:25,282 --> 01:47:29,184
" On one hand, the public prosecutor
poses awkward questions..."

1033
01:47:29,252 --> 01:47:32,312
everyone is against her.
She has no one to offer any sympathy

1034
01:47:33,356 --> 01:47:36,519
" She's a woman, after all.
How long will she fight them?"

1035
01:47:36,793 --> 01:47:38,317
So tell us what we are to do

1036
01:47:45,769 --> 01:47:52,766
" We must send word to her that we're
around, in this very city..."

1037
01:47:52,843 --> 01:47:57,212
so that she isn't scared
and stands her ground

1038
01:47:58,281 --> 01:48:01,842
The Thakur will have to admit it some
day that she is indeed his wife

1039
01:48:10,260 --> 01:48:11,750
Let's see how this girl is doing

1040
01:48:17,934 --> 01:48:21,927
But l don't know what l will do here.
- You're right too

1041
01:48:22,439 --> 01:48:25,169
" lf you are idle like this,
you're bound to be scared"

1042
01:48:26,209 --> 01:48:27,198
You ought to be doing some work

1043
01:48:28,345 --> 01:48:30,438
" Look, how dirty the window panes are"

1044
01:48:31,214 --> 01:48:32,738
" Nurse, get her piece of cloth"

1045
01:48:33,416 --> 01:48:34,974
Clean the window panes

1046
01:48:36,253 --> 01:48:40,451
" lf you work, you will soon tire.
And that will help you sleep well"

1047
01:48:40,824 --> 01:48:41,813
Am l right?

1048
01:49:06,850 --> 01:49:07,839
Doctor!

1049
01:49:10,654 --> 01:49:11,643
Doctor!

1050
01:49:12,289 --> 01:49:14,849
What happened?
- He knows everything. Get him!

1051
01:49:15,258 --> 01:49:18,284
Catch him before he runs away.
He knows l'm the Thakur's wife

1052
01:49:18,361 --> 01:49:22,161
" Doctor, catch him! He'll escape.
- Who will escape...?"

1053
01:49:22,232 --> 01:49:25,963
The bandit... catch him

1054
01:49:26,202 --> 01:49:27,191
Shut up!

1055
01:49:36,680 --> 01:49:39,274
Come with me... come

1056
01:49:42,552 --> 01:49:43,541
Sit down

1057
01:49:45,355 --> 01:49:49,849
" Look, you're a very nice girl.
You mustn't say such things"

1058
01:49:50,627 --> 01:49:51,616
Do you understand?

1059
01:49:53,296 --> 01:49:57,756
" lf you continue to behave like this,
l'll be angry and l won't talk to you"

1060
01:49:58,501 --> 01:49:59,490
Get that...?

1061
01:50:12,315 --> 01:50:14,476
" Heard something, lnspector?
- What happened?"

1062
01:50:14,751 --> 01:50:16,719
The bandit Suryavar Singh
is in town

1063
01:50:19,222 --> 01:50:21,486
l knew he would come.
- Did you?

1064
01:50:21,791 --> 01:50:23,656
Long ago.
- And why is he here?

1065
01:50:24,961 --> 01:50:26,451
Two reasons why he's here

1066
01:50:27,230 --> 01:50:29,425
The first is to finish the Thakur

1067
01:50:30,233 --> 01:50:32,963
So that this woman can
inherit all his wealth

1068
01:50:34,270 --> 01:50:37,262
" On the other hand,
if this scheme doesn't work..."

1069
01:50:37,340 --> 01:50:39,831
he'll himself kill the woman.
- What for?

1070
01:50:40,377 --> 01:50:43,938
He's afraid that we might get the woman
to tell us everything about his gang

1071
01:50:44,748 --> 01:50:47,308
Send men to stand guard
at the Thakur's house

1072
01:50:47,584 --> 01:50:49,518
And ask the Thakur to be careful

1073
01:51:42,272 --> 01:51:46,641
" Sargam, go upstairs and tell Rakesh
that the inspector is here to see him"

1074
01:52:03,893 --> 01:52:05,292
Come... sit down

1075
01:52:06,563 --> 01:52:09,828
l have good news for you.
- What?

1076
01:52:10,300 --> 01:52:11,790
You're absolutely all right

1077
01:52:12,435 --> 01:52:14,528
They'll come and take you away
tomorrow morning

1078
01:52:14,838 --> 01:52:16,396
Who? Thakur saheb?

1079
01:52:17,507 --> 01:52:20,601
l don't remember where
l kept the diary

1080
01:52:21,177 --> 01:52:23,577
And he won't believe me.
Till he believes me...

1081
01:52:23,646 --> 01:52:26,809
" Look, we're giving you a discharge
because you have recovered"

1082
01:52:27,183 --> 01:52:29,617
" lf you keep talking like this,
we'll have to keep you here"

1083
01:52:30,453 --> 01:52:31,442
But doctor...

1084
01:52:31,955 --> 01:52:37,154
You know who you are. You know very
well that you're not his wife

1085
01:52:37,861 --> 01:52:41,194
" Despite all your tricks,
nobody could believe you"

1086
01:52:41,931 --> 01:52:46,197
And why? Only because you
are not Geeta. You are Raina!

1087
01:52:47,770 --> 01:52:51,729
You needn't be afraid. You must
accept the wrong you have done

1088
01:52:52,509 --> 01:52:55,171
You must leave yourself
to the mercy of the court

1089
01:52:55,612 --> 01:52:59,514
You're a young woman. You have
a long life ahead

1090
01:53:00,283 --> 01:53:03,184
Why mustn't you leave the dark world
of loot and plunder...

1091
01:53:03,253 --> 01:53:05,744
and start a new life?

1092
01:55:49,252 --> 01:55:50,844
So you have escaped
from the asylum?

1093
01:56:05,835 --> 01:56:08,429
Police station...?
- Please don't call the police

1094
01:56:08,538 --> 01:56:09,527
Give me just a minute

1095
01:56:10,340 --> 01:56:12,604
For Geeta's sake

1096
01:56:19,749 --> 01:56:20,738
What is it?

1097
01:56:21,784 --> 01:56:23,547
l wish l had not lied

1098
01:56:24,821 --> 01:56:28,518
" One lie, that ruined my life"

1099
01:56:29,592 --> 01:56:33,187
What lie?
- The lie l used...

1100
01:56:33,262 --> 01:56:35,526
to enter your life

1101
01:56:36,999 --> 01:56:40,230
l never told you.
- Why didn't you?

1102
01:56:41,003 --> 01:56:44,632
Because l had fallen
in love with you

1103
01:56:45,375 --> 01:56:49,209
" l thought, if l told you
the truth,..."

1104
01:56:49,278 --> 01:56:51,746
the fair name of your family
would be tarnished

1105
01:56:52,582 --> 01:56:56,245
" l thought you would hate me,
that you would leave me"

1106
01:56:57,387 --> 01:57:01,551
What truth is that which could
have tarnished my family name?

1107
01:57:01,958 --> 01:57:04,518
That would make me hate you
and leave you

1108
01:57:07,463 --> 01:57:13,698
The fact is that my mother
was a loose-moralled woman

1109
01:57:15,238 --> 01:57:18,765
l even had a twin-sister.
An absolute look-alike

1110
01:57:19,776 --> 01:57:20,902
She looked just like me

1111
01:57:22,211 --> 01:57:26,443
" Like my mother, she went wayward too
and ran away from home..."

1112
01:57:26,516 --> 01:57:31,749
" to join a gang of bandits
After she had left,..."

1113
01:57:31,821 --> 01:57:33,982
my mother intended to push me
towards her evil ways too

1114
01:57:35,291 --> 01:57:37,623
" l was so fed up,
l decided to commit suicide"

1115
01:57:38,628 --> 01:57:41,290
When l was about to kill myself...

1116
01:57:41,364 --> 01:57:45,198
" you appeared, as my new life,
and saved me"

1117
01:57:46,736 --> 01:57:48,397
l'm really your wife

1118
01:57:49,305 --> 01:57:54,538
" That woman who died in your arms,
whom you even cremated..."

1119
01:57:54,610 --> 01:57:57,807
wasn't me... it was my twin-sister

1120
01:57:58,514 --> 01:58:01,347
lt happened when you were abroad

1121
01:58:01,951 --> 01:58:02,940
One night

1122
01:58:05,955 --> 01:58:07,354
lt was late in the night

1123
01:58:08,224 --> 01:58:10,852
l was reading a book and l don't
know when l went to sleep

1124
01:58:53,269 --> 01:58:54,258
You...?

1125
01:58:58,608 --> 01:58:59,597
What do you want?

1126
01:59:00,243 --> 01:59:01,232
Open the door

1127
01:59:03,980 --> 01:59:04,969
Hurry up

1128
01:59:32,808 --> 01:59:33,797
Nisha...

1129
01:59:53,829 --> 01:59:54,818
Geeta...

1130
01:59:56,566 --> 01:59:58,193
l haven't eaten for two days

1131
01:59:59,635 --> 02:00:01,398
My enemies are after me

1132
02:00:03,306 --> 02:00:04,398
Please save me

1133
02:00:05,908 --> 02:00:08,308
Please give me shelter
for a night

1134
02:00:09,812 --> 02:00:12,679
l'll leave tomorrow

1135
02:00:14,417 --> 02:00:16,180
l'll never bother you again

1136
02:00:17,486 --> 02:00:22,185
" l'll never show you my face.
One night, please...?"

1137
02:00:54,490 --> 02:00:56,754
She was running a high temperature

1138
02:00:57,693 --> 02:01:02,187
l was afraid what l would
tell someone who came upstairs

1139
02:01:03,232 --> 02:01:06,633
Nobody knew about Nisha.
Not even you

1140
02:01:44,407 --> 02:01:46,500
l was awake all night

1141
02:01:49,912 --> 02:01:54,315
" ln the morning, l was scared
that someone would come upstairs..."

1142
02:01:54,383 --> 02:01:55,748
and the secret would be exposed

1143
02:02:10,466 --> 02:02:12,934
" Aunt...
- What is it, dear?"

1144
02:02:13,402 --> 02:02:16,235
l've decided to fast today.
- What's special about today?

1145
02:02:16,572 --> 02:02:20,303
l want to fast for my husband.
- What a noble woman we have

1146
02:02:20,643 --> 02:02:24,340
" He's abroad, and my dear girl is
worried about him back home"

1147
02:02:24,747 --> 02:02:26,772
l want to read the Holy Gita
till l see the Moon

1148
02:02:27,249 --> 02:02:29,376
Don't let anyone come upstairs.
- Very well. Go on

1149
02:02:29,552 --> 02:02:30,610
Nobody will come

1150
02:02:34,256 --> 02:02:37,817
" That night, Nisha's condition worsened"

1151
02:02:38,461 --> 02:02:41,430
" lnstead of subsiding,
her fever had increased"

1152
02:02:42,264 --> 02:02:43,891
l didn't know what to do

1153
02:02:44,300 --> 02:02:46,495
lt was difficult to hide her
in that condition

1154
02:02:46,769 --> 02:02:50,330
" l knew, at daybreak, someone or
the other would come upstairs"

1155
02:02:50,573 --> 02:02:53,633
Nisha's secret would be exposed.
l was very scared

1156
02:02:54,210 --> 02:02:56,542
" lf l had called a doctor, the whole
household would have got to know"

1157
02:02:57,313 --> 02:03:00,282
Then l thought of going out myself
and fetching some medicines...

1158
02:03:00,349 --> 02:03:03,785
so that Nisha would feel better
and leave in the morning

1159
02:03:04,620 --> 02:03:07,384
l gave her a sari
of mine and said...

1160
02:03:08,390 --> 02:03:13,692
" Nisha, wake up and wear my clothes.
l'm going to bring some medicines"

1161
02:03:14,563 --> 02:03:18,659
" Even if someone comes upstairs,
keep lying down. Get up"

1162
02:03:40,523 --> 02:03:45,483
" Wear this, Nisha. Even if someone
comes, he'll think l'm lying here"

1163
02:04:23,566 --> 02:04:26,262
lf you had indeed given her
a sari of yours...

1164
02:04:26,335 --> 02:04:28,428
where are the clothes
your sister was wearing?

1165
02:04:30,606 --> 02:04:33,769
The clothes are right here.
Come with me

1166
02:04:39,982 --> 02:04:41,449
They're in there

1167
02:05:03,272 --> 02:05:06,002
My diary! l've found my diary!

1168
02:05:06,041 --> 02:05:11,809
l had kept it on the table
where l also kept Nisha's clothes

1169
02:05:12,648 --> 02:05:15,617
" When l hid the clothes, the diary
must've been carried with it"

1170
02:05:17,386 --> 02:05:18,512
" Yes, l remember now..."

1171
02:05:19,588 --> 02:05:20,577
Hats off to you

1172
02:05:21,857 --> 02:05:25,486
When did you keep the clothes there?
And when did you keep the diary?

1173
02:05:26,996 --> 02:05:31,990
" That's a nice drama you've enacted.
- No,.. this is no drama"

1174
02:05:32,234 --> 02:05:33,223
Shut up!

1175
02:05:35,304 --> 02:05:37,864
l know your men are in town

1176
02:05:39,208 --> 02:05:41,972
You got someone to hide
the diary in the clothes...

1177
02:05:42,211 --> 02:05:45,874
and he informed you in the asylum
that the job was done...

1178
02:05:45,948 --> 02:05:48,212
and you escape from the asylum to
show that the diary's right here!

1179
02:05:48,284 --> 02:05:51,879
" What is this if not a drama?
- Believe me, l'm not lying"

1180
02:05:52,288 --> 02:05:54,586
" Believe me, l'm speaking the truth!"

1181
02:06:14,243 --> 02:06:15,210
Look at this

1182
02:06:21,984 --> 02:06:22,973
This is my mother

1183
02:06:23,919 --> 02:06:25,944
And that's my twin-sister. Nisha

1184
02:06:26,822 --> 02:06:30,189
And this is me... it's a picture
of our childhood

1185
02:06:36,632 --> 02:06:38,463
Any news?
- We're still at it

1186
02:06:41,770 --> 02:06:44,967
Let's go either ways.
But remember...

1187
02:06:45,207 --> 02:06:47,641
l want a cross-fire
when l start firing

1188
02:06:47,843 --> 02:06:49,640
" Do we have men outside?
- Oh yes, sir"

1189
02:06:49,712 --> 02:06:51,475
" He's dead-meat, if he steps out.
- So let's go"

1190
02:06:59,421 --> 02:07:01,821
Thakur! The bandit Suryavar Singh
is in the courtyard

1191
02:07:01,924 --> 02:07:03,448
Stay there.
Don't come down

1192
02:07:10,332 --> 02:07:12,425
" No, don't kill him!
Don't kill him!"

1193
02:07:27,282 --> 02:07:28,271
No...

1194
02:07:33,188 --> 02:07:34,450
Don't kill him! Don't !

1195
02:07:44,266 --> 02:07:47,394
He's been hit by a bullet.
But why did the girl interfere?

1196
02:07:48,937 --> 02:07:50,632
Hold the fire!

1197
02:07:53,242 --> 02:07:55,733
lt'll kill the girl

1198
02:07:57,713 --> 02:07:58,873
Thakur saheb...

1199
02:08:00,582 --> 02:08:04,211
l want to meet only you

1200
02:08:06,321 --> 02:08:08,619
Step back. Stay here

1201
02:08:09,425 --> 02:08:12,258
lf you guys are still suspicious...

1202
02:08:13,262 --> 02:08:14,229
here you are

1203
02:08:39,888 --> 02:08:42,220
l'm the Thakur. What do
you want to say to me?

1204
02:08:43,225 --> 02:08:44,214
Thakur saheb...

1205
02:08:45,461 --> 02:08:47,520
l wanted to tell you that...

1206
02:08:49,264 --> 02:08:52,392
your wife is alive.
- What are you talking?

1207
02:08:52,935 --> 02:08:56,598
" lt's true, Thakur saheb.
Your wife is alive"

1208
02:08:57,372 --> 02:08:58,862
She's your wife

1209
02:09:03,912 --> 02:09:04,901
And this woman...

1210
02:09:07,516 --> 02:09:10,883
the one you have built
this monument for...

1211
02:09:13,288 --> 02:09:15,381
is my Nisha

1212
02:09:16,925 --> 02:09:18,825
She was my wife

1213
02:09:22,965 --> 02:09:27,561
Nisha was angry with me

1214
02:09:29,238 --> 02:09:35,404
She wanted me to give up
loot and murder

1215
02:09:36,745 --> 02:09:39,714
" One day, she ran away from me
and came to the city"

1216
02:09:41,683 --> 02:09:44,447
l came to the city
to take Nisha back...

1217
02:09:45,521 --> 02:09:50,322
" and in a case of mistaken identities,
l carried Geeta with me"

1218
02:09:51,527 --> 02:09:52,516
Sister Geeta...

1219
02:09:54,196 --> 02:09:58,223
" because of me, you've had to
go through a lot of trouble"

1220
02:09:59,268 --> 02:10:02,533
Please forgive me

1221
02:10:06,642 --> 02:10:07,802
Nisha...

1222
02:10:47,482 --> 02:10:52,579
Everywhere you go...

1223
02:10:52,654 --> 02:10:57,853
my shadow will follow you

1224
02:10:58,293 --> 02:11:03,458
Everywhere you go...

1225
02:11:03,532 --> 02:11:08,799
my shadow will follow you

1226
02:11:08,870 --> 02:11:10,861
My shadow...
