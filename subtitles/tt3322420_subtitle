13
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:22,683
you do whatever you want
on honeymoon

14
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:26,088
if you are opening beers then
send two here.

15
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:49,036
I don't even believe it. I'm getting married
I'm nervous

16
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:52,006
it feels like a dream

17
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,179

they were all saying that papa has
decorated the shop like a bride

21
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:15,568
Mom was saying that she'll wear Saree
but she didn't change

22
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:22,808
I've given my mobile to Chintu

32
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:14,067
It's not good for bride and groom
to meet before

33
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:18,135
I saw the tent guy when I was coming

34
