1
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,040
Hello Lalaji!

2
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,160
Hello Lalaji! - Hello Everyone,

3
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,880
Greetings to all!
- God bless you all!

4
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,040
How are you? - I'm fine.

5
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,880
How is Shanti?
- She's fine as well.

6
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,080
Where are the children?

7
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,840
Grandpa has arrived! Grandpa!

8
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,400
Distribute these
amongst everyone.

9
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,840
Come children I'll
give you the sweets.

10
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,680
Headman! - Yes Lalaji?

11
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,160
Keep this key with you.

12
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,680
Convert this mansion into a
school for the children.

13
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,600
And education should not be based
on caste or religion here.

14
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,600
This village is my family,

15
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,040
I'm returning this
ancestral land to you,

16
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,000
..though I can never return the
love that you all have given me.

17
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,040
Aunty! - Sir!

18
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,520
Are you leaving us? - Oh No!

19
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,880
Please don't cry.

20
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,520
Here, keep this.

21
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,360
Find your daughter a good husband
and marry her pompously.

22
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,040
God bless you sir.
- Hey! Get Aside.

23
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,320
Hello grandpa, it's
me, Bhiku, bulls.

24
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,400
Bhiku, I've given this
pair of bulls to you,

25
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,880
..so that you can
plough the field alone

26
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,600
You want me to plough the fields?
- Yes.

27
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,760
No Grandpa.

28
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,840
Hariya, Nagu, Bholaare,
will work for me.

29
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,160
They are very scared of me

30
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,840
Do you want to scare them
into working for you?

31
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,080
Learn from your sister who's
studying hard in the city,

32
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,600
..and has become
an ideal for many!

33
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,480
You'll definitely get good results,
If you work hard. Understood?

34
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,120
Work hard? - Yes.

35
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,000
Alright, I'll work myself. Yes.

36
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,160
Chaudhary! - Yes.

37
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,760
Has everyone been allocated
land in the village? - Yes sir.

38
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,880
They are all landowners now.

39
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:41,240
Long Live Lalaji!
Long Live Lalaji!

40
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,760
What'll you leave or take
with you from this world?

41
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,160
Lala, you've almost
distributed everything,

42
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,600
..but a small piece of land.

43
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,640
Kalandar, I'm not greedy.

44
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,040
This is a memoir of my family,

45
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,480
This is where my ancestors
started their lives from.

46
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,640
Right!

47
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You've distributed the interest but
kept the principle wit h yourself!

48
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,440
Well said Kalandar!

49
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,280
Why are you taking
this mud with you?

50
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:27,800
Houses in the city are
made of bricks, not mud.

51
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,440
No Kalandar, it's not that.

52
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,400
It's for my grandson Vishal's
birthday, who lives in the city.

53
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,680
He should remember that
he's a farmer's son,

54
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,440
..born from the same soil.

55
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,720
You're right. We're born from the
soil and will go back to it.

56
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,760
Well Said Kalandar.

57
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,880
Lalaji, your son Laxminarayan went
to the city and earned millions,

58
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,840
..but never came back.

59
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,200
It all depends on one's values,

60
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,640
..same values are taking me back
to the city after this long.

61
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,760
My son's business has
grown so much that,

62
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,280
..he has no time to relax.

63
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:15,520
My grandson is handling
everything on his own now.

64
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,440
Vishal, it's been long since
we've played a prank,

65
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,360
..let's do something.

66
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,160
You're with Vishal, son of the
business tycoon Laxminarayan,

67
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,720
..do whatever you feel like.

68
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,680
Thank you.

69
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,440
Excuse me brother, Did you
do anything wrong? - No

70
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,600
Alright, can I borrow
your cigarette then?

71
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,880
What nonsense!! - Excuse me!

72
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,760
I lost my way, which way should I go?
- That way.

73
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,480
Alright. This way? - No!

74
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,880
He's blind.

75
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,720
You're right! - Leave! Will you?

76
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,080
Sorry brother, I'm leaving.

77
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,880
Now that you know me, why don't
we go somewhere? - Go away!

78
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,200
Alright!

79
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,240
I'm sorry. Can I have
a glass of water?

80
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,440
Hey! That's alcohol not water,

81
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,760
..don't you know the
difference between the two?

82
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,880
Sorry, I'm blind.

83
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,360
I can't even differentiate
between a man and woman.

84
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,080
What are you doing here then?

85
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,000
Same as you!

86
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,720
Is she your Sister?
- Vishal's sycophant!

87
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,400
Why are you acting blind?
- I was just joking.

88
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,360
Is it? I'll teach you a lesson.
- Vishal!

89
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,400
Hello! Keep fighting friends!

90
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,640
Way to go! Hit him hard!

91
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:49,000
Come let's go.
- Barman, give me one more peg.

92
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,760
You're so drunk that
you've lost your senses.

93
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,880
Who's drunk?

94
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,720
Meter chalu, Get him along.
Why me always?

95
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:09,480
I've lost 50,000 rupees!
I'm ruined now!

96
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,160
No, I'm not interested.

97
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,600
Why are you wasting my time now?

98
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,040
Look, I'm not interested
in your proposal.

99
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,560
Sir, Mr. Batliwala on the phone.

100
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:32,320
Hello Mr. Batliwal, I'm Catching
the 10:45 flight to London.

101
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,320
We can discuss everything
once I'm back. Okay.

102
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,240
Mr. Srivastav

103
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,200
Yes Srivastav, Give
me the headlines.

104
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,040
Yes. Alright. I'll buy
shares worth 20 million.

105
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,000
Goodbye.

106
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,480
Kapoor, Have the sugar mill
papers ready before I return.

107
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,080
Yes Sir.

108
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,880
When are you coming back sir?
- 10 am day after tomorrow.

109
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,080
Mr. Rehmaan!,

110
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,840
I'm terribly sorry

111
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,880
I'm very interested in your deal
but a little busy right now.

112
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,680
We'll discuss this, once I'm
back from London. - No problem.

113
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,720
Sorry Gentlemen, I'm
getting terribly late.

114
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,880
And I cannot afford
to miss this flight.

115
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,760
Sir, please may I
have a word with you.

116
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,880
What happened?

117
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,200
Your son has broken
down my disco,

118
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,800
..damages are worth
50,000 rupees.

119
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,520
Even I have a few pending
bills of Mr. Vishal

120
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,520
What's all this? Pay them!

121
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,040
What else have I hired you for?
- I'm very sorry sir.

122
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,040
Come with me, please.
- Thank you sir.

123
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,880
Can't you handle such
small issues yourself?

124
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,440
Hello Dad! Hi!

125
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,520
Kapoor, that letter for
Ferguson Anderson.

00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,000
Dad, It's 20 th of January today

00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,680
Won't you wish me?

129

Give this blank cheque to Vishal.

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,480
Grandpa, have some food.

141
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,400
How long will you
wait for Vishal?

142
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,480
No Saxena,

143
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:03,800
..not till I wish him, and put
vermilion on his forehead.

144
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,040
You can go and rest

145
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,160
He's a jolly good fellow

146
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,680
Vishal!
- He's a jolly good fellow

147
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,520
Vishal!
- He's a jolly good fellow!

148
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,760
Bless you son. May you
live a hundred years!

149
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,880
Hey Grandpa!

150
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,640
Friends this is my, grandfather!

151
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,480
Grandpa, when did you come?

152
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,360
This evening, son.

153
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,880
How could I forget this day?

154
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,040
Wish you a happy Birthday,
May god bless you!

155
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,640
Thanks granddad, thanks.

156
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,360
Where's my birthday present?

157
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,440
I've got it!

158
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,880
The old man is filthy rich.

159
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,880
He must’ve got something
marvelous for him.

160
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,520
What's it grandpa?

161
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,280
My entire wealth is in this bag.

162
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,280
Must be Diamonds!

163
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,520
Worth many a bottles of whiskey.

164
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,400
Mud?? You've got mud for me?

165
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:24,280
It’s cow dung from village!
- Shut up! Idiots.

166
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,720
Son Vishal, This is
from our village.

167
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,000
Your father's his reputation,
this mansion, fame,

168
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,400
..everything belongs
to it, accept it

169
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,320
Grandpa! Don't do this.

170
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,880
He's got mud for me!

171
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,760
Friends, my mood's been ruined now!
Am off to sleep.

172
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,640
Good Night Friends.
- Good Night.

173
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,840
Good Night. - Bye

174
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,080
Let's go friends! It's
an old age home now,

175
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,640
'..what will you do with this
mud in the city Ganpat Rai?'

176
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,640
'Houses in cities are
made of bricks, not mud,'

177
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,040
'..it's of no use there.'

178
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,400
You were right, Kalandar.

179
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,160
This is usual.

180
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,280
No point stressing
yourself on this sir.

181
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,440
Someone has to look
after Vishal, Saxena,

182
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,760
My son has no time for him.
- Here he is.

183
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,600
Laxminarayan, Welcome my son!
- Dad!

184
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,400
How was your trip? - Perfect.

185
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,880
Bless you, so was the
trip profitable?

186
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,120
Come, sit down

187
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,760
You've finally returned from
the village, dad. Great!

188
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,880
Can I tell you something? - Yes.

189
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,800
It would've been better
had I not come here.

190
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,880
What do you mean?

191
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,160
Did you face any problems here?
- Yes, a lot of them!

192
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,680
I'll fire each and every one of
you for not taking care of him.

193
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,560
It's not his fault.

194
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,480
You may go, I've
to speak with him.

195
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:19,880
What's the matter, dad?

196
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,240
Listen Laxmi, even though
you've become a millionaire,

197
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,880
..you're not wealthy. - What?

198
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,840
You can't even sleep
well at night,

199
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,000
Where will this wealth take you?

200
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,680
I didn't get you, dad?

201
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,360
Spare some time to
think about Vishal,

202
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,800
..he's our real wealth.

203
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,440
Are you aware of
what he's doing?

204
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:51,320
Who his friends are
and how spoilt he is?

205
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,200
What're you saying?
- The truth son!

206
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,600
He's ruining himself.

207
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,560
Hi Dad!

208
00:19:59,200 --> 00:19:59,880
When did you arrive?

209
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,080
I hope you had a nice trip!
Morning!

210
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,040
Okay, see you.

211
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,080
Where are you going?
- For a stroll.

212
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,520
Have you been to office lately?
- Office..

213
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,640
Well I think... - Don't think.

214
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,320
I'll think for you from now on.

215
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,880
But dad..
- You'll go to office everyday from now on.

216
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,120
But.. Me and office?

217
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,040
And you'll return at 7 pm sharp.

218
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,720
Grandpa! - Go to the office.

219
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,040
Okay.

220
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,880
Good Morning Sir!
- Good Morning.

221
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,560
Come.

222
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,640
Chotelal, can you check if
it's raining outside? - Why?

223
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,240
It seems that today he's
slipped his way to office!

224
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,040
Hello? - What's going on?

225
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,440
We came to the office
looking for you,

226
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,480
..but your illiterate
grandfather stopped us.

227
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,120
What does he think of himself?
- I'm extremely sorry, pal,

228
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,760
..you know how old folks are!

229
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,240
I'll meet you guys in the evening.
- Evening?

230
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:27,120
Vishal! There's a musical
program this evening.

231
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,720
Where? - Same old place.

232
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,400
The dancer is a dream.

233
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,160
Are you coming from office?
- Hey grandpa!

234
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,840
Why are you still awake?

235
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,240
Because you drove away my sleep!

236
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,360
Did I? No grandpa.

237
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,560
Let me check where
your sleep is,

238
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,200
Let me check.

239
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,560
Vishal! - Huh?

240
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,400
Is this the time to come home?

241
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,240
Home?! I'm at home!!

242
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,080
You're drunk?!

243
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,520
Oh Come on!

244
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,800
What else should I
drink in this age?

245
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,080
Vishal, You're talking nonsense?

246
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,880
Why are you arguing
with your grandfather?

247
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:12,480
Arguing? Did I argue with you, grandpa?
- Yes!

248
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,600
All right, Sorry.

249
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,720
Father, I didn't think that..

250
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,160
You don't have the time son!

251
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,800
I'll have to do something now.

252
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,240
Good Morning Sir!

253
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,560
Sir?

254
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:18,240
Well..
- I'm your secretary, sir.

255
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,200
Are you?

256
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,880
Well then, do come in.

257
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,880
What's your name? - I'm Shalini.

258
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,880
Hello... Hello. Hello.

259
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,560
Vishal, are you coming today?
Vishal, are you there?

260
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,240
Were you planning to
go out somewhere?

261
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,440
No problem, I'll come back later.
- No, I'm not going anywhere,

262
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,120
..please have a seat.
- All right, I'll get you some papers.

263
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,800
No, Sit down.
- You need to sign them.

264
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,560
Oh, Shalini..

265
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,720
Sir, please read and
sign these letters.

266
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,000
I don't need to read
them, I trust you.

267
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,400
Thank you sir. Not here.

268
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,840
Oh! I'm extremely sorry,
I made a mistake.

269
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,760
Shall I go now?

270
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,880
Which perfume do you use?

271
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,120
The whole room smells nice!

272
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,160
Perfume? Let alone perfumes I
don't even know of any brands

273
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,680
This seems to be your
natural fragrance,

274
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:07,240
It's better than any brand.

275
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,880
Sir, you're getting
too personal.

276
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,160
We can talk about
this after 5:30.

277
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,400
So is 5:30 certain?
Is that a deal?

278
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,400
You forgot to light
your cigarette.

279
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,120
After 5:30.

280
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,840
Who is she?
- Oh I forgot to introduce!

281
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,360
She's Shalini, My new Secretary.

282
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,320
Hello! - Personal.

283
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,760
And Shalini, Meet my friends

284
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,600
Captain Batli

285
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,040
Meter chalu

286
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,360
Cutter - Razor

287
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,520
Ruhi - Hello!

288
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,680
Greetings!

289
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,200
Vegetarian Beauty!

290
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,440
***. - What?

291
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,880
What would you like to have?
- For me..

292
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,880
We'll all have coffee.

293
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:06,840
Coffee!

294
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,760
Behave yourself.

295
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,640
What are they saying?

296
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,880
They're saying that you're very beautiful.
- Yes,

297
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,720
You're really Beau-ti-ful.

298
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,080
Where's that smell coming from?

299
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:48,160
Smell? Is that what you call it?

300
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,320
Excuse me, I've got to make
an urgent call be right back.

301
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,120
You ignored us the
whole day for her?

302
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,360
Sometimes to change the taste
you must have hot dishes.

303
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,200
Okay, understood.

304
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,880
But why that urgent call?

305
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,680
Grandpa? I'm calling
from Hotel Hamilton.

306
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,120
Vishal's with me.

307
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,720
Make sure that he doesn't
drink and is back on time.

308
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,160
It's very strange
here and I'm scared,

309
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,880
Vishal's friends are
all around him.

310
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:25,000
Hence I've assigned you, to
get him out of bad company.

311
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,000
Operator. - Yes sir.

312
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,000
Which number has that
girl in the lobby dialed?

313
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,200
She's called your home. - What?

314
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,720
Yes sir. - Are you sure?

315
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:33,560
Yes sir.

316
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,680
Captain? - Yes.

317
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,240
Something's wrong.

318
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,680
What's wrong? - This girl is
talking to someone in my house.

319
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,160
Your house? - Yes.

320
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,880
Mystery!
- Fine but what do I do?

321
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:54,760
Forget that just grab the girl.

322
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,040
So what's the plan?
- The same old one.

323
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,680
That's a very good idea.
- Hurry up, she's coming..

324
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,280
What happened to him?
- Nothing serious,

325
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,040
He frequently gets such attacks.
- Waiter, fetch the room keys fast.

326
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,080
I'll take you upstairs and
massage you, You'll feel better.

327
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:19,320
No. - I'm his personal
secretary, I'll drop him home.

328
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,320
He's serious. He cannot
walk, but only lie down.

329
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,320
But in this condition...
- Do you want to lie down?

330
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,880
Take me to the room.
- He'll lie down in the room.

331
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,080
Then take him.

332
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,880
You take him, you're his
personal secretary.

333
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,160
I'll take him. Come with me.

334
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,000
Go and lie down.

335
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,360
Oh my God, Poor Boy!

336
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,720
Lie down. - Very good.

337
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,200
I'll call the doctor right away.

338
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,800
No, I just want your company,

339
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:55,320
Sit next to me, please.
This is only temporary.

340
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,720
Sit closer.

341
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,880
You have to sit closer
to the sick one.

342
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,600
It's better to keep
some distance.

343
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:10,200
I brought you here to
come close to you.

344
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,520
I know your plan now..

345
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,240
Even I know your plan.

346
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,320
Your not a my secretary.

347
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,200
Leave me! Leave me! - Tell me.

348
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,600
Don't move towards me!
Don't move towards me!

349
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,600
Else I will jump
from this window.

350
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,160
Easy baby, easy.

351
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,880
Don’t get dramatic,
have faith in me.

352
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,400
Till date I've played with
every beautiful toy, ma'am.

353
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,400
None of them broke, understood.

354
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,880
Please let me go,
what are you doing?

355
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,600
Where did this old
man come from?

356
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:49,800
Catch him or there'll
be a problem.

357
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,720
Leave me! Leave me!

358
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,400
Oh No, old man, Can't you see
the board Do Not Disturb'?

359
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,360
Get aside.

360
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,880
Leave me! - Come on.

361
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,880
Leave me! - Come on.

362
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,240
Stop it.

363
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,640
Come on. - Leave me!

364
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,520
Vishal! - Hey.

365
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,040
Open the door Vishal!

366
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,200
Grandpa!

367
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,720
Grandpa!

368
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,880
Indecent, shameless!

369
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,880
How could you do that?

370
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,480
You're a bad name to us.

371
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,720
Don't you dare raise a
hand on our friend!

372
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,360
It's your filthy company
that has spoilt him.

373
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,560
I feel like strangling you,

374
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,680
It would've been better
if you were dead.

375
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,760
Old man, what's the speech for?

376
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,200
Go back to your village if you're
ashamed of Vishal's habits,

377
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,320
..we don't need you here.

378
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,000
I had to hear this
because of you!

379
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,400
Let's go.

380
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,320
Let's go.

381
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:05,280
Please forgive me,

382
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,120
That was my mistake.

383
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:14,120
I was overcome by the
desire to change him.

384
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,760
I've put you in distress.

385
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,640
I could never imagine this.

386
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:27,240
Forget it grandpa.

387
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,120
How can I?

388
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,600
I've to get punished for this,

389
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,600
I made a mistake.
- No, don't say that

390
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,720
I'm burdened by your favours.

391
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,080
Today, whatever I am, is
because of your grace,

392
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,840
..after my father's death, you've
supported me like your own.

393
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,880
That's alright, but..

394
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:53,440
Whatever've achieved is,

395
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,120
..not as valuable as your tears.

396
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:02,880
I regret that I failed
in improving Vishal.

397
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,360
It's not humanly possible.

398
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,240
He'll change with time.

399
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,320
I don't have enough time.

400
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:23,240
He's shattered the dream
I came here with.

401
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,600
I can neither go back
nor live here now.

402
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,880
I don't understand,
what should I do.

403
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,640
Gentlemen, you must have
read the contract papers,

404
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,160
I've agreed to their
demand in principle.

405
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,600
I had a discussion with
Marshal and Company,

406
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,480
..we have to send them a
reply at the earliest.

407
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:50,840
Any objections?

408
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,800
Excuse me sir. - Yes?

409
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,560
An urgent phone call
from your house.

410
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:59,520
Hello. - Grandpa has just
arrived and is very worried.

411
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,800
He is talking crazy
in his worryness.

412
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,600
He says that he can't
live here anymore.

413
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,880
Please come home as soon as possible.
- Alright.

414
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,440
Sun and Sands Hotel?

415
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,880
Is Mr. Laxminarayan's son Mr.
Vishal there?

416
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,120
No? Alright.

417
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,720
Vishal?

418
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:50,600
Vishal..

419
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,680
Vishal..

420
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:06,200
Vishal?

421
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,880
Any information about Vishal?

422
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,160
Nurse, get the injection.

423
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,720
Please come in Mr. Verma.

424
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:59,720
Mr. Vishal, meet Mr. Verma,
the solicitor of our company.

425
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,360
Your father always considered his
opinion regarding business matters.

426
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,360
Glad to meet you.

427
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,040
Mr. Vishal, I'm sorry
for your loss.

428
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,200
Please sit down.

429
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,840
Your father drafted a
will before his death.

430
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:22,160
We can talk about
the will later.

431
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:26,240
No, I'd rather read it out
in front of your managers,

432
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,680
..and directors right now.

433
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:29,840
Okay. - Send them out.

434
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,880
Let's go. - Please.

435
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:37,360
You mean us? Alright.
We don't care.

436
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,240
Old man, don't mind.

437
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,680
As per this will,

438
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:50,240
..you are deprived of his
entire business, properties,

439
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,480
The bungalow in this city,
Darjeeling, Shimla,

440
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,520
..and bank balance.

441
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:03,600
You have been evicted
from all the properties.

442
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,400
What? But I'm his only son?

443
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,440
But you'll have to accept
either of the two conditions,

444
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,880
..in the will to inherit this.

445
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,000
Tell me.

446
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:24,640
The first condition is that
you'll have to marry Shalini.

447
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,840
After which each of you
will get half the property.

448
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,480
Who the hell is she?
I'll not marry her!

449
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,680
What has she got to do with my family?
- Patience please.

450
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,680
These are your father's words.

451
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,640
There is a second option, if
you disagree to marry her.

452
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:44,680
He has three acres of
land in his village.

453
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:49,200
If you can farm for a
year on that land,

454
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,200
..you can inherit everything.

455
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,280
Rs 50,000 will be deposited
with Verma and Solicitors,

456
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,400
..which you will use to
buy a tractor, seeds,

457
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:06,880
..and for your daily
needs for a year.

458
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:13,560
If you refuse both the conditions,
Shalini will inherit everything.

459
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,080
How can I marry an ordinary
secretary or plough the fields?

460
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,840
If I don't accept these
conditions willI be a paper?

461
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,520
This is injustice,
it's totally wrong.

462
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,080
Shalini has planned this all!
- Exactly!

463
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,560
What do you mean?

464
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:37,480
How are you related
to my family?

465
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,280
Mr. Vishal, this
is a school, not,

466
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:45,040
..your bar where you
speak your mind

467
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,840
I don't want a rogue like you
to even come near these kids.

468
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,400
Come this way.

469
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,000
You're no better!

470
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,880
You misled my father,

471
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,040
..and got the properties
transferred in your name!

472
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,040
What nonsense?

473
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,400
Stop acting innocent!

474
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,880
My father's will reads,

475
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:09,600
..that I can inherit half of his
properties only if I marry you,

476
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,120
Even then the rest goes to you.

477
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,240
How dare you think I'll ever
marry a nanny like yourself?

478
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,480
Mr. Vishal! Hold your tongue,

479
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:23,040
..forget about marrying you, I
can't even stand you. - Shut up!

480
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,520
I'll not let you
get away with it.

481
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,320
I'll accept the
second condition,

482
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:34,880
..and get my property back!!

483
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,040
What a speech! You should
have been a leader..

484
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,120
Shut up and think what to do!

485
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,840
I have thought about it.

486
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,200
It will happen exactly the
way you have told her.

487
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:53,840
We'll go to your village and
bring in Green Revolution!

488
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,640
Wow, what a beauty!

489
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,000
Vishal, take a look.

490
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:09,240
Look, do you like her?

491
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:15,720
Babe, come here!

492
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,160
She's coming, grab her!

493
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,640
What do you want, brat? - What?

494
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,840
Don't you have manners?

495
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,840
Learn some and teach him too,

496
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,760
What do you want?

497
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,880
Where's Shyam Nagar?

498
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,400
This is Shyam
Nagar, who are you?

499
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,640
What do you want?

500
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:40,800
Who are they?

501
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:42,880
That's what I'm asking them.

502
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,120
Hello.

503
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,560
Where's Lala Ganpat Rai's farm?

504
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,320
Grandpa's farm? There!

505
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,760
Come, drop us there.

506
00:50:55,320 --> 00:51:00,880
We have more friends,
shall I call everyone?

507
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:03,560
Why not? There is lot of space.

508
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:07,520
Santo, Bantu, Dhanno,
moti, Hira!!

509
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:11,640
Place them on your lap now.

510
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:13,120
Pretty clever!

511
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,160
Not clever but smart!

512
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:17,440
Why do you want to go to Grandpa's farm?
- Shanti!

513
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,200
Shanti! How do you know my name?

514
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:22,840
Are you Shanti? - Yes.

515
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,240
I'm Vishal, glad to meet you.
- What's this?

516
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:26,880
I'm Lala Ganpat Rai's grandson.

517
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,320
You! Are you Lala Ganpat Rai's grandson?
- Yes.

518
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,040
Really?! Sorry I made a mistake.

519
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:35,160
You're respected well here!
- Villagers,

520
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,600
..grandpa's grandson is here!

521
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,800
Grandpa's grandson is here!

522
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:46,200
Villagers, Grandpa's
grandson is here!

523
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,880
Grandpa's grandson is here!

524
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:52,720
It's *** hot here.

525
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:01,320
So this is the farmhouse? A hut!

526
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:10,160
Dog. House full! This
belongs to a dog!

527
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,880
Vishal, was your grandpa
living in this stable?

528
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,880
No, he lived in the village,

529
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:20,320
He donated that house
to village school.

530
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:23,680
Don't worry, we'll
make it a paradise.

531
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:27,400
Sir, we are seeing you
for the first time.

532
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:32,280
Son, what made you come
here after all these years?

533
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:40,880
Well.. - We've helped the city,

534
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:48,000
..and now thought of doing
some good to the village

535
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:53,200
Bringing!
- Bringing in Green Revolution here!

536
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,080
Is that a well there?

537
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,840
Is that a well there?

538
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,120
Anyone home? Can
I get something?

539
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:07,760
No? Then I'm off!

540
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,760
I'll get it there!

541
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:16,880
Don't worry, we'll teach you all
the new techniques of farming..

542
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,280
Don't teach them those
new techniques,

543
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,880
..that they shouldn't forget
their old techniques.

544
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:30,880
Headman, the city has now
entered the village!

545
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:36,840
Headman, the city has now
entered the village!

546
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:39,880
Who is that beggar?

547
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:43,720
He's a saint, not a beggar.

548
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:49,200
No one argues with him, not
even your Grandfather!

549
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:53,120
Alright, but can we get some
labors to unload our luggage?

550
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,480
Don't worry, We'll help you.

551
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,800
Lovely! Very good.

552
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:03,360
What's in these boxes?

553
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:07,560
Nectar, care to taste?

554
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,840
Look, the red chili
and her friends!

555
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,880
Come on in!

556
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,120
God! What's this?

557
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,360
Sir, we brought you
something to eat and drink.

558
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:53,440
Drinking is regular, did you
bring us some food as well?

559
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,040
Yes! I'll just show to you.
- Yes.

560
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:03,120
Bread made of corn flour, garlic
paste, mango pickles & onion.

561
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:07,560
Do you call this food?
Looks like cattle feed!

562
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,360
It seems like it is animal's food.
- What?

563
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,760
Nothing, what do you have in these pots?
- Buttermilk, sir.

564
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,880
Hey! What's that?

565
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:21,040
It's called the village beer!

566
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:27,320
Why are you scared? This is
our buttermilk, have it.

567
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,080
We don't drink all this,
try our buttermilk.

568
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:33,280
Let's try.

569
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:37,320
It really cools you down.
- Try, try!

570
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,320
This is not even toddy!

571
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:46,280
We lead a simple life,
no one drinks here.

572
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:49,000
Whoever drinks here
gets punished.

573
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,240
Captain Batli!

574
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:56,160
You'll get beaten everyday.
- I don't mind if she beats me.

575
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,400
What's he saying?
- Nothing much.

576
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,080
He is just showing you
his handkerchief.

577
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:04,000
Vishal, let's do one thing.

578
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:06,400
Let's go and see her
fields together.

579
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:11,200
As we are new here and we've
maintain public relations too.

580
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:14,120
And you know we've
to reach the goals.

581
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:17,520
Can you show me your fields?
- Why not!

582
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,600
Let me wear my pants. - Great.

583
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:22,200
You go ahead.

584
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:26,480
In the meanwhile we'll start
to develop the relations here.

585
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,200
Look, these are our fields,
some have 2 acres, some 4.

586
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:44,880
What are you looking at?
- A scene here too?

587
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,160
Too bad, don't look there.

588
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,880
Any affair between them? - What?

589
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,120
Any affair between them?

590
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:59,240
She's newly married, she
brought lunch for her husband.

591
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,000
How boring! - What?

592
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,600
Nothing, let's go. - Come.

593
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:10,640
Come. - Where are you taking me?

594
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,520
Here, have some milk.

595
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,760
Come here. - Okay.

596
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,760
Jump! - How?

597
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:29,720
Hold my hand, extend yours.

598
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:39,160
Why are you pulling me towards you?
Jump!

599
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:48,040
I'm covered with mud!

600
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:26,600
Are you tired? Drink the cold
water and you'll be fine.

601
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,440
How? Yes.

602
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:47,360
Drink it this way.
- I have a problem.

603
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:48,440
Where? - What problem?

604
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:49,880
Where? - What problem?

605
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:58,160
Your pants are tight, you should
have left them in the city.

606
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:04,080
Bow your head, here.

607
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:19,880
Hey listen! - Yes?

608
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,400
Are you having an
affair with someone?

609
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:25,360
Why are you laughing?

610
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:30,200
I'll get married the
day I fall in love!

611
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,120
What? - No affairs!

612
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:38,680
Bhikhu!

613
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:45,200
You can serve strangers,
as if I'm worthless!

614
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:47,880
I've asked you not
to mess with me!

615
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:53,240
Hey, my love. When did
I misbehaved with you?

616
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,400
Even I don't want to, but
you don't care for me.

617
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:57,880
I would have! Had
you been retarded.

618
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:01,840
For you I can be!

619
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:12,880
It’s very nice.

620
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:19,320
Let's go.

621
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,480
Get the dresses...

622
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:32,320
Greetings everyone! - Greetings!

623
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:35,760
Come on! - Help!

624
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:39,040
Help!

625
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:46,880
Help! Help! - Come on!

626
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,280
Hey stop! - Come here!

627
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,480
What are you doing?

628
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,800
What are you doing?
- This is a village not your city!

629
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:58,160
Only women are allowed
in this pond!

630
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:02,880
Oh god please help me - Hey.

631
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,320
Lord Rama, Lord Rama

632
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:13,400
Lord Rama, Lord Rama - Leave me.

633
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:14,880
Hey, why are you hitting them?

634
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,160
Madam, you go.

635
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:17,560
I am unmarried.

636
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,880
We are not allowed to see
some women in this condition.

637
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,200
Please don’t go.

638
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:25,360
Don’t go. If you
leave, he'll smash us.

639
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:32,600
He is a strong man. He can smash you.
- Hey, don’t touch me.

640
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,560
Not just hands,
you just hug him.

641
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:39,880
Hey, You've ruined my religion.

642
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:14,120
Caught you.

643
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:18,080
You are holding my feet.

644
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:22,160
Madam, it's water, I got
hold of whatever I can.

645
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:25,360
You dirty insect of village,
how can you touch my body?

646
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:28,400
Madam, if you so upset
for touching your feet,

647
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,160
..shall I hold your hand.
- Shut up,

648
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,040
..bloody idiot, leave me alone.

649
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:38,240
Hey, you are running,
my name is Bhiku.

650
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:39,320
I will surely meet you again.

651
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:51,120
Help!

652
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:52,880
Help!

653
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:00,840
Help! Help!

654
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:23,320
Girl, it's a village.

655
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:28,160
Forget about humans, even dogs
don’t like nudity over here.

656
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,560
One of the female from city ,

657
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,640
..was roaming around
the village necked.

658
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:39,600
One more thing Mr Chaudhary,

659
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:44,880
Madi told me that two men
troubled women in the river.

660
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:49,880
This behavior can affect
our families as well.

661
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:51,280
That's true,

662
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,240
..but we have to consider Lala
Ganpat Rai's fav ors towards us,

663
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:59,080
..his grandson brought
filthy rats here.

664
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:04,840
We should alert the villagers
to stay away from them.

665
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:09,440
So you've managed to
woo Shanti right?

666
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:13,000
I can't relax until I do.

667
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,080
Wow. - Cheers!

668
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:16,880
Wow. - Chalu!

669
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,680
You keep telling me that the
tractors are on their way.

670
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:20,880
Where are they?

671
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:24,560
Where are they?

672
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,440
Who's going to tell him that
we drank away that money?

673
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:34,480
It will come at the right time.

674
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:37,880
When? Farmers have already started
sowing seeds in their fields.

675
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:41,840
We'll do that as well, and run
the tractor over it later.

676
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,840
Lovely!

677
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:49,560
Let's start the
process tomorrow,

678
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:52,760
..forget the tractor, we'll
do it with our hands.

679
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:56,000
We'll do it with our hands.
- Cheers!

680
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,600
Parade halt!

681
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:14,680
Ok boys, get ready to work.

682
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:37,200
What should we do here?

683
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:41,040
The first principle
of agriculture is to,

684
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:45,040
..pull out the weeds
from the land.

685
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:50,640
The second principle, clean
the field off the stones,

686
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:56,800
..and sow the seeds. - Oh I see.

687
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,480
Start removing the weeds then.

688
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:02,800
Alright! Let's do it. - Okay.

689
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:04,440
2 inches deep pit here!

690
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:12,400
Buddy, how will the trees
grow if we remove the grass?

691
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,160
And there would be no
rain without the trees,

692
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,240
..and no crop without the rain!

693
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:19,520
And how can we have the Green
Revolution without the crops?

694
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:22,240
That's why I think we
shouldn't cut the grass.

695
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:24,280
Oh! Correct.

696
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,640
Alright, but at least
remove the rocks.

697
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:30,280
Hold on! Wait a minute.

698
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:37,880
We need these rocks
to mark our names,

699
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:40,560
..once we've brought in the
Green Revolution here.

700
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:44,600
Correct! - So why remove them?

701
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,680
Let it be here.
- But at least start somewhere.

702
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:49,640
Shall we sow the seeds?
- Where is seeds?

703
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:51,160
Go and get the seeds. - Go.

704
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:52,720
Go and get the seeds. - Yes.

705
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:56,520
Go and get the seeds! - Okay.

706
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:57,600
Let me read the
chapter on seeds.

707
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:06,080
This field, and the climate

708
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:08,440
Where shall I plant this?
- Okay. Look...

709
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:10,840
Keep some water here.

710
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:12,640
Dig a pit 1½ inches deep.

711
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:19,360
Give him another one. - Right.

712
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:23,440
Are you sure that all this is
written in the book? - Trust me.

713
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:27,760
Now take that raddish, plant
it in the pit with some water.

714
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:30,440
But it's only one raddish.

715
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:34,440
We just need one. In no time
there'll be raddishes all around!

716
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:36,520
I hope you aren't fooling me.

717
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:42,680
Why are you laughing at us?
- This isn't how one farms!

718
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,160
We are not using old techinques.

719
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:50,760
We are using the new techniques.
- Go ahead!

720
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:54,080
In the meanwhile I'll learn about
the old techniques from Shanti.

721
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:57,720
Shanti, I'll always
need your support.

722
01:07:58,360 --> 01:07:58,880
Meter Chalu?

723
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:00,880
Yes Darling! - Take this.

724
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:06,880
You're an expert flirt,
but hats off to Vishal.

725
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:11,000
Nice! You will
support me, right?

726
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:19,120
Hold it, we are sweating.

727
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:21,280
Let the villagers
work in the sun,

728
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:29,080
..we'll work after 4
pm when it's better.

729
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:30,360
Cheers!

730
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:58,280
Oh my lord.

731
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:17,360
Why are you making that
noise unnecessarily,

732
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,880
..when the first ray of the sun,

733
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:26,720
..the temple bells, etc.
couldn't wake them up,

734
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:29,240
..how do you believe to do it?

735
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,880
Let's go, they are in deep sleep.
Let's go.

736
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:39,600
I'll leave only after
the auspicious work.

737
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:42,360
I came for, is done.
Wake them up please.

738
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:49,800
They've woken up. Tell them
whatever you wanted to.

739
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,080
Greetings Sir!

740
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:54,240
What is it this early
in the morning?

741
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:59,800
I'm a widow, today is my
daughter's betrothal,

742
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:04,640
..your grandpa used to bless such
functions with his presence.

743
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:06,520
Since you're here,

744
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:15,200
..it'll be nice if you could
attend the function and bless her

745
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:17,520
What have I to do with all this?

746
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,640
It's all about human
relations son.

747
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:25,240
Women and men have many forms;

748
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:33,360
..one of them is that of
a sister and a brother.

749
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,160
If you want to recognize
this relation,

750
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:42,720
..consider Bansi as your
sister and get her betrothed.

751
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:45,320
Let's go.

752
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:06,880
Now give your
brother-in-law the gifts.

753
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:12,880
Here?

754
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:19,880
Congratulation.

755
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:28,680
She's hot!

756
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:35,760
It's your duty to protect the
sanctity of this brotherband.

757
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:41,840
Come on, get aside.

758
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:46,640
Let's go, I'm getting bored.

759
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:51,720
Bansi looks hot today.

760
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:57,720
You lost your chance since
she"s your sister now.

761
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:01,880
I've a lot of chances
here, look there.

762
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:21,040
Wait! - Oh god.

763
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:23,640
Where are you going?

764
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:26,640
Home, where are you going? - I.

765
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:28,600
Yes. - To your house.

766
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,480
My house?! Of course!

767
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:37,600
Bansi is lucky to get a secondary
school graduate as her partner.

768
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:39,000
Graduate? - Yes.

769
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:41,800
The one who's very
knowledgeable.

770
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:44,600
Then he'll keep teaching me forever!
- That's right.

771
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,080
So what type of a
groom do you want?

772
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:49,880
What type of a
groom do you want?

773
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:54,360
Whoever my destiny brings to me.
- Destiny?

774
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:57,800
Yes. My destiny will bring
me a wonderful partner.

775
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:06,640
Then I'm very lucky, the
prettiest girl is in my destiny.

776
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:07,520
Who is she?

777
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:11,520
You.

778
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:13,760
Affair?

779
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:57,360
Love isn't for sale here sir!

780
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:01,440
Be sincere or go
back to the city.

781
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:17,560
'Be sincere.'

782
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:19,560
'Be sincere.'

783
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:21,840
'Be sincere.'

784
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:24,240
'Love isn't for sale here sir!'

785
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:28,160
'Be sincere or go
back to the city.'

786
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:33,680
'Be sincere or go
back to the city.'

787
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,520
Liquor all the time?

788
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,240
A millionaire's son is doomed
& none of you are bothered.

789
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:44,360
Where's the tractor you
were supposed to bring?

790
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:47,080
Tractor? - Yes, the tractor!

791
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:52,120
What tractor? How else did we buy
these cigarettes and liquor?

792
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:56,880
Oh I see, so you all
have been ditching me?

793
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:59,840
Did you buy liquor with the
tractor money? You scum.

794
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:03,480
Vishal!

795
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:04,640
Stop it. - what are you doing?

796
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:05,720
Go away! - Vishal!

797
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:08,760
All the whiskey…

798
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:12,160
Not just alcohol, you've bought
the entire shop you scum.

799
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:15,520
Listen Vishal!

800
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:20,560
Vishal, please don’t throw the whiskey.
- Vishal!

801
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:23,440
Please Vishal, stop it.
- Vishal!

802
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:29,080
No! No Vishal, No! No!

803
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:35,840
Vishal! Vishal! - No!

804
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:55,320
Darling Vishal?! - Get away!

805
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:59,880
Listen carefully, I want to
rejuvenate my ruined destiny.

806
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:00,880
Now I'm determined to
cultivate crops here.

807
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:05,880
Stay if you want or leave.

808
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:16,840
He's totally changed!

809
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:20,880
He even raised his hand on her.

810
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:25,520
I'll teach him a lesson.

811
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:44,240
I can use this illiterate villager
to teach Vishal a lesson.

812
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:47,360
I'll woo him.

813
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:54,320
Did you just whistle?

814
01:20:55,280 --> 01:21:01,600
That's the first time I
heard a beauty whistle.

815
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:06,600
What's so special in me?

816
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:11,520
Look into my eyes and you'll
realize how beautiful you are!

817
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:14,520
It would be a problem if
someone sees us talking here.

818
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:18,600
No one can dare come near me.

819
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:20,320
Oh really. - Yes.

820
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:21,680
Let's go to your house.

821
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:25,800
My house? Lord, my prayers
are being answered!

822
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:31,200
But why did you run away from
the river the other day?

823
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:33,880
Later that day I realized that,

824
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:37,480
..you are the real man,
rest all are losers.

825
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:38,600
Oh really.

826
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:40,440
So come with me - Your hens.

827
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:45,320
This is not mine.
You only for me.

828
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:51,280
Greeting. - Greeting.

829
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:53,120
Do you tie the brotherhood
band to bullocks too?

830
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:56,640
Yes. Bullocks protect
the farmers.

831
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:02,600
I need a pair of bullocks but
no one is selling it to me.

832
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:05,880
Bullocks are any farmer's
greatest wealth,

833
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:08,880
..moreover it's t he season now,

834
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:12,040
..no farmer is so poor enough to
sell his bulls in this seas on.

835
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:13,320
Bye.

836
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:22,240
You need a pair of
bullocks, right?

837
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:27,160
Bhiku has it, he neither
ploughs nor sows seeds.

838
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:30,120
He may give you the
pair for some money.

839
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:32,880
Oh my love. - Bhiku

840
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:37,720
Vishal is here.

841
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:41,560
Bhiku. - You don’t worry.

842
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:43,720
Someone here. - I take this.

843
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:54,040
Here!
- Greetings! I need a favor from you.

844
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:55,840
From me? - Yes.

845
01:22:56,360 --> 01:22:58,240
What help do you need from me?

846
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:00,880
I need this plough and
your pair of bullocks.

847
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:03,880
The bullocks?!

848
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:09,280
It's the season to
sow seeds though,

849
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:13,880
But since you've come for the first
time, I wouldn't disappoint you.

850
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:20,480
My bulls cost 2000 rupees each.

851
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:25,760
Here's 4000 rupees,
bring the bulls to me.

852
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:29,560
Wait, I'll just get them.

853
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:34,760
I feel like singing,
I feel like dancing…

854
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:40,360
1, 2 - Did you
sell the bullocks?

855
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:46,480
Yes, that idiot gave 4000 rupees
for bullocks worth 2000 only.

856
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:50,520
You'll forever remain
an illiterate,

857
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,560
Now that he's bought the bullocks,
he'll plough the fields.

858
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:58,160
As soon as the crop shoots up,
he'll become a millionaire.

859
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:05,560
Idiot, who can become rich
by ploughing a small field?

860
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:10,360
Yes, he can become a millionaire
and that's why I have come here.

861
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,800
I don't want him to farm Bhikhu,

862
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:24,160
I want him to be a beggar,
do it by any means possible.

863
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:26,440
Is that so?

864
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:32,880
I'm Bhiku, I can do anything.

865
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:34,440
Brother Vishal!

866
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:38,200
Brother Vishal!

867
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:43,480
Get up, come on. – What?

868
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:46,760
What?
- There is a hot girl outside.

869
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:49,600
Girl? - I swear!

870
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:54,200
Brother Vishal!
- Careful, careful.

871
01:24:57,880 --> 01:25:01,280
Bansi, it's you? Please come inside.
Please come.

872
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:03,640
Where is brother Vishal?

873
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:05,360
I came here to tie
holy thread to him.

874
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:08,320
Is it? You came here to tie
holy thread to your brother?

875
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:10,720
He is taking bath.

876
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,480
Maybe he is getting
ready for the ritual.

877
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:14,800
Come on, sit inside
and wait for him.

878
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:17,880
Come on, please come, come.

879
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:33,200
Please have a seat. Please sit.
- Please come.

880
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:37,880
Give me this platter, I'll
keep it there. Please…

881
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:38,880
Offer her cold drink.

882
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:41,520
Yes, yes. Please get the
cold drink quickly.

883
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:44,320
He is getting cold drink for you.
Coco-cola!

884
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:47,360
Just a minute, hurry up.

885
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:53,400
Bring it quickly. He is getting it.
Bring it.

886
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:57,880
Take it. - No!

887
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,480
Please have it, else Vishal
will get upset with us.

888
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:02,880
He'll say that we didn’t
welcome his sister properly.

889
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:04,120
Please have it, please…

890
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:06,240
Please have it, please…

891
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:10,480
It's just Coco-cola. Cold drink!
Please have it.

892
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:35,880
I'll wait outside. Please let me go, sir.
Let me go.

893
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:11,480
Please let me go.

894
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:39,880
Welcome!

895
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:44,720
Bansi is leaving today.
- Bansi is leaving.

896
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,880
Won't you go and see her off?

897
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:55,480
She was betrothed recently, why
is she being married off so soon?

898
01:27:56,720 --> 01:28:01,280
This happens when a girl becomes
a burden on her poor parents.

899
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:03,680
Let's go.

900
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:16,360
No music on wedding, Kalandar?

901
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:26,160
No music.
- It's there but you can't hear it son.

902
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:27,120
Follow me.

903
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:45,680
Look at your sister's face for the
last time before she's taken away.

904
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:49,720
Doesn't she look like
a beautiful bride!

905
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:55,880
Listen to the dreadful noise!

906
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:58,600
Listen to her screams that can
tear your heart into pieces,

907
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:05,720
..and make the world shiver!

908
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:13,160
Her soul screams out that not her
but the humanity died today!

909
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:16,600
I will die along with
the humanity, today.

910
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:19,640
Vishal! Hey, Vishal!

911
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:24,760
Which inauspicious moment
brought you to this village?

912
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:31,360
She was supposed to get married
with her brother's blessing,

913
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:36,880
..not die because of him!

914
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:39,520
My poor child!

915
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:42,720
Scream as loud as you can,

916
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:48,720
..so that other mothers
can save their daughters,

917
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:49,800
..from such a devastation.

918
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:06,360
You cannot escape
us after all this.

919
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:12,200
Even you should be
cremated with Bansi.

920
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:16,560
Hit him! Hit him! Hit him!

921
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,240
Hit him! Hit him!

922
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:25,480
Hit him! Hit him! Hit him!

923
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:30,600
Bhiku, stop it - Leave me,
I won't spare him alive.

924
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:36,240
You're not God Bhikhu!

925
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:41,280
The sinner will be
punished for sure,

926
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:45,680
..but the judge should be pious.

927
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:47,880
But we'll decide his fate!

928
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,880
Yes! - No!

929
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:56,320
Get lost forever before
we kill you Vishal.

930
01:30:57,160 --> 01:30:58,840
Don't you dare come back here.

931
01:30:59,240 --> 01:31:04,440
She was your sister.
- Beat him and throw him out.

932
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,640
You've let down your sister.

933
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:12,040
Kill yourself if you can!

934
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:17,880
You guys can live without
liquor, but not me.

935
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:24,360
I've hidden two bottles somewhere
here, But can't find them now.

936
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:30,440
Hey! They are my bottles, mine!
- Listen!

937
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:37,440
They are my bottles, mine!

938
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:52,120
They are my bottles, mine!

939
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:07,560
How could you do
that to my sister

940
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:11,080
She wasn't your real sister.
- She was hot.

941
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:13,240
She was my sister.

942
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:22,600
My bottles.

943
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:50,480
Get lost from here, ***!

944
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:57,880
You... - Don't hit me,

945
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:04,560
..the liquor has already
killed me Vishal.

946
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:10,520
Listen, come closer to me,

947
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:20,680
We've always cheated you, for
our selfish interest Vishal.

948
01:33:21,200 --> 01:33:25,880
I'll tell you the truth
in my last hour.

949
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:33,880
Listen, don't leave this farm,

950
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:37,520
..none of us were your
true friends ever,

951
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:40,680
..we were just longing
for your wealth.

952
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:48,840
Don't ever leave this farm.

953
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:53,200
We've done the worst
possible, but we named it

954
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:56,000
Aadarsh Farm.

955
01:33:57,640 --> 01:33:58,480
Try to...

956
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:09,560
Try turning it into a reality.

957
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:20,160
Here.

958
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:28,480
He'll starve to death now.

959
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:18,880
Shanti,

960
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:25,360
Shanti, please let me have
some water, I'm very thirsty.

961
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:28,280
Here,

962
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:35,200
Shanti. - Bansi was no one to
you but she was my friend.

963
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:38,640
It's better to spill the water
than to quench a sinner's thirst.

964
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:43,200
No, I'm innocent. I was with
Bhiku, buying bullocks from him.

965
01:38:43,640 --> 01:38:46,880
Believe me, I'm innocent.

966
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:09,720
Hit him! Hit him! Hit him!

967
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:15,600
Hit him! Hit him! Hit him!

968
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:22,520
Hit him! Hit him! Hit him!

969
01:39:23,240 --> 01:39:27,640
Hit him! Hit him! Hit him!

970
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:32,880
Rogue, dog, listen carefully,

971
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:40,000
..the Panchayat decided to
slaughter and bury you,

972
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:42,840
..if you enter these boundaries.

973
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:48,640
Villagers, hear this carefully!

974
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:54,640
If any of you go there,
you will face the same.

975
01:39:55,120 --> 01:40:00,560
Water. Water.

976
01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:13,760
Have some water.

977
01:40:17,560 --> 01:40:20,280
I repent that I didnt give
you some this afternoon.

978
01:40:21,080 --> 01:40:28,720
It's a God's gift, a human has no
right to deprive another of water.

979
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:30,440
Drink it.

980
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:36,040
Do you still
consider me a human?

981
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:40,080
My father wept to death,

982
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:45,560
..and my grandpa was insulted
by everyone because of me.

983
01:40:46,760 --> 01:40:51,880
I destroyed this
village as well.

984
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:59,760
I've no right to live,

985
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:05,360
let me starve to death.
- No vishal.

986
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:10,360
We'll be cursed if that happens.

987
01:41:12,160 --> 01:41:17,080
No, it'll be a blessing.

988
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:22,840
But, where are your friends?

989
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:28,880
They were my enemies, who never
let me take the right path.

990
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:37,200
I chased them away and one
is lying there, dead.

991
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:43,240
Oh Lord, didn't you
do his funeral?

992
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:48,440
I'm a corpse myself.
I've sinned Shanti.

993
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:52,240
This is all the
result of my sins.

994
01:41:54,400 --> 01:42:01,400
I'll be decaying
like him tomorrow.

995
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:10,080
Dont say so, it's enough
that you're repenting.

996
01:42:11,800 --> 01:42:13,040
Come on, have some water.

997
01:42:19,880 --> 01:42:25,720
I'll help you to start
your new life now.

998
01:47:59,400 --> 01:48:02,280
Where are you coming
from so late at night?

999
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:04,320
I'm not answerable to you.

1000
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:07,880
I protect the village's respect.

1001
01:48:08,480 --> 01:48:10,280
So what have I done?

1002
01:48:10,640 --> 01:48:14,280
You went to meet him at
this hour, that's what!

1003
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:16,760
Bhiku let me go.

1004
01:48:17,080 --> 01:48:19,120
How can I let you go?

1005
01:48:20,400 --> 01:48:27,000
Hey, you slapped me.
Acting smart, bit me.

1006
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:32,240
Where are you going? Uncle!
Kallu, is anyone there?

1007
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:34,720
Everyone! Come out!
- What is it? Leave her!

1008
01:48:35,120 --> 01:48:39,680
She looks naive but
she's a sinner.

1009
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:41,880
What?
- She went out to meet that man.

1010
01:48:42,360 --> 01:48:43,640
What? - Yes.

1011
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:45,880
Did you go to meet Vishal?

1012
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:51,880
No woman of this village has
ever stepped out in dark,

1013
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:56,240
..and you secretly go out at
night to meet that enemy?

1014
01:48:56,440 --> 01:48:57,840
What is it? - Uncle...

1015
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:01,280
What are you doing here?

1016
01:49:01,720 --> 01:49:03,680
Ask your daughter

1017
01:49:04,160 --> 01:49:09,760
how she goes out at the dead
of night to meet that guy.

1018
01:49:10,440 --> 01:49:12,600
Yes. - Is that true?

1019
01:49:13,320 --> 01:49:19,360
Yes mom, but I didn't
do anything wrong.

1020
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:24,880
What?! I'll have to
teach you a lesson.

1021
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:28,800
Come on you... - Aunt, leave
her. She has done it by mistake.

1022
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:06,880
Vishal! Vishal!

1023
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:10,760
I traced out the thief.
- Which thief?

1024
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:15,280
He's Bhiku, your things and
the girl are in his house.

1025
01:50:16,680 --> 01:50:17,880
Bhiku.

1026
01:50:21,720 --> 01:50:24,120
Bhiku, open the door and
get her out as well.

1027
01:50:24,680 --> 01:50:27,080
That's Vishal, now
what do we do?

1028
01:50:28,160 --> 01:50:31,320
Don't worry. I'll take you
somewhere safe first.

1029
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:32,560
I'll handle them.

1030
01:50:33,080 --> 01:50:33,680
Come with me.

1031
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:49,040
Bhiku, you can't
escape your fate.

1032
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:53,320
Come on, go from the front door.
- Bhiku.

1033
01:51:00,120 --> 01:51:03,880
What did you come here again for?
- To confront you!

1034
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:07,800
Why are you challenging death?
- Death?

1035
01:51:08,600 --> 01:51:11,880
This is my first
step towards life.

1036
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:13,880
Then I"ll make it your last!

1037
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:31,240
Uncle. - Hey what hapennd?

1038
01:52:31,880 --> 01:52:34,400
He came to the village again people!
- We'll kill him!

1039
01:52:34,640 --> 01:52:39,600
No, don't raise your
hand on Vishal,

1040
01:52:39,880 --> 01:52:44,600
This entire village will be ruined.
Let it be.

1041
01:52:51,320 --> 01:52:54,880
He's fighting the right battle.

1042
01:52:55,160 --> 01:52:59,360
Yes, now you'll all know
who's good and who's evil.

1043
01:52:59,640 --> 01:53:03,400
Are you again
supporting our foe?

1044
01:53:03,720 --> 01:53:07,040
Come! I'll show you the reality.
Come with me.

1045
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:10,880
These are Vishal's things,

1046
01:53:11,600 --> 01:53:16,520
..which were stolen
by that devil!

1047
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:27,480
Look at her, this is what's
been happening in this village,

1048
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:28,880
Amongst us, the decent families.

1049
01:53:31,480 --> 01:53:32,720
Come on.

1050
01:53:33,160 --> 01:53:36,880
Look at her, since when
have we turned into Rogues?

1051
01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:43,880
Initially even I hated
and ignored Vishal.

1052
01:53:45,160 --> 01:53:48,880
And we were forcing him to starve
to death outside the village.

1053
01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:52,160
His is death. We all are burdened
by his grandpa's favors.

1054
01:53:53,680 --> 01:53:56,320
He is starving here,

1055
01:53:56,680 --> 01:53:58,680
..and we are living off of
his grandfather's debt.

1056
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:04,880
I did commit the sin of
giving water to a dying man.

1057
01:54:05,120 --> 01:54:07,800
Kalandar and I are
together in this sin.

1058
01:54:08,160 --> 01:54:14,400
I'm ready for any punishment but
at least give justice to Vishal.

1059
01:54:15,200 --> 01:54:17,840
Forgive us, we
misunderstood you.

1060
01:54:18,360 --> 01:54:21,800
But why did you bring such
filthy people with you?

1061
01:54:22,600 --> 01:54:30,400
He's repented for that sin,
but who'll clean this dirt?

1062
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:35,200
Us! Yes! Us! - No!

1063
01:54:38,240 --> 01:54:42,160
Bhiku, wipe off your sweat.

1064
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:47,000
Bhikhu, This land
will turn barren,

1065
01:54:47,880 --> 01:54:49,880
if even one drop of
your sweat falls on it.

1066
01:54:50,200 --> 01:54:52,360
Let's lock them in the
house and burn it down.

1067
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:56,480
No, the sinner will
burn in the sin's fire!

1068
01:54:58,240 --> 01:55:05,400
Bhiku, leave this village. Now!

1069
01:55:10,240 --> 01:55:11,800
Let him go.

1070
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:31,880
Vishal will have to face the
consequences for challenging me.

1071
01:55:34,240 --> 01:55:36,760
Shanti. - Mother!

1072
02:02:10,600 --> 02:02:11,720
What are you staring at now?

1073
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:17,120
He'll be a millionaire and
you'll remain useless.

1074
02:02:18,160 --> 02:02:19,560
You are a useless creature.

1075
02:02:23,880 --> 02:02:28,320
Where are you going?

1076
02:02:29,480 --> 02:02:34,520
You'll have to live and die
here with me. Get out.

1077
02:02:42,640 --> 02:02:45,320
Shalini's photo, with you?

1078
02:02:46,320 --> 02:02:47,440
How do you know her?

1079
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:49,800
What's your relation with her?

1080
02:02:51,400 --> 02:02:52,360
She is my sister.

1081
02:02:53,760 --> 02:02:56,080
Your real sister? - Of corce!

1082
02:02:58,080 --> 02:02:59,600
We were very young
when our parents died.

1083
02:03:00,040 --> 02:03:01,160
She's been living
in the city since.

1084
02:03:02,360 --> 02:03:03,880
But why are you asking me this?

1085
02:03:05,200 --> 02:03:08,000
Vishal's father wanted
him to marry her,

1086
02:03:09,400 --> 02:03:11,080
..and even the will is
made in her favour.

1087
02:03:13,080 --> 02:03:18,280
This is how tables turn!

1088
02:03:19,160 --> 02:03:24,480
If the will favor's my sister,
I'll get all the property.

1089
02:03:26,800 --> 02:03:38,240
My name is Bhiku. Until I'm
alive, nobody can prove that

1090
02:03:39,080 --> 02:03:40,360
Come on.

1091
02:04:10,240 --> 02:04:11,240
No!

1092
02:04:35,680 --> 02:04:38,880
Set fire to the crops!

1093
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:49,320
Stop it! No!

1094
02:05:21,800 --> 02:05:23,040
Get out!

1095
02:05:24,160 --> 02:05:26,040
Get out!

1096
02:05:30,360 --> 02:05:32,600
Get out!

1097
02:05:36,040 --> 02:05:37,440
Hit him.

1098
02:05:57,600 --> 02:06:00,720
Crush him. - Stop it!

1099
02:06:01,480 --> 02:06:03,720
Shalini, get aside!

1100
02:06:04,240 --> 02:06:09,200
Did you call me here
to see this bloodshed?

1101
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:16,360
No, to assure you that he too is
finished along with the crops.

1102
02:06:17,560 --> 02:06:22,520
You'll inherit the property now,
which you will transfer to me!

1103
02:06:23,680 --> 02:06:25,880
No! His grandfather
raised us up,

1104
02:06:26,200 --> 02:06:34,000
..got me educated and gave
us a new life, brother.

1105
02:06:34,240 --> 02:06:36,280
Shut up. How can you
do this to him?

1106
02:06:37,360 --> 02:06:40,880
Lock her up until she agrees to
transfer the property to me.

1107
02:06:41,640 --> 02:06:44,440
No. please...

1108
02:07:09,240 --> 02:07:11,200
Save me Vishal!

1109
02:07:34,320 --> 02:07:35,680
Get out of the way!

1110
02:07:35,880 --> 02:07:39,360
Get out of the way!

1111
02:07:39,600 --> 02:07:40,440
Leave her!

1112
02:07:40,600 --> 02:07:43,640
You're not strong enough to
hold these horses Kalandar.

1113
02:07:44,680 --> 02:07:50,440
God's devotees have
a strong will.

1114
02:07:55,400 --> 02:07:57,200
Run away! Go.

1115
02:07:57,680 --> 02:07:59,640
Crush that lame man too!

1116
02:08:31,240 --> 02:08:32,840
Take it, godman.

1117
02:08:43,320 --> 02:08:44,520
Call your god!

1118
02:09:02,760 --> 02:09:04,080
Vishal!

1119
02:09:07,320 --> 02:09:08,080
Vishal.

1120
02:09:17,880 --> 02:09:48,560
Oh god.

1121
02:10:46,520 --> 02:10:49,000
Don't hit me! - Why?

1122
02:11:21,040 --> 02:11:21,520
Bhiku!

1123
02:11:27,200 --> 02:11:31,120
Lord Krishna wouldn't have
incarnated if Kans didn't exist.

1124
02:11:34,440 --> 02:11:38,440
Lord Rama wouldn't have incarnated
had Ravenna not existed.

1125
02:11:45,880 --> 02:11:47,880
Had there been no
massacre or bloodshed,

1126
02:11:48,760 --> 02:11:52,440
Buddha and Jesus wouldn't
have spread their message.

1127
02:11:53,600 --> 02:11:59,840
Why would God sent Rasool, had
humans had the sense of equality?

1128
02:12:02,080 --> 02:12:03,760
Tell me why?

1129
02:12:06,160 --> 02:12:06,840
Speak up!

1130
02:12:08,760 --> 02:12:09,640
Speak up!

1131
02:12:14,280 --> 02:12:17,320
Run as much as you can.

1132
02:12:35,400 --> 02:12:37,160
We won't leave him today.

1133
02:12:41,440 --> 02:12:44,160
No! Please Don’t hit me!.

1134
02:12:49,360 --> 02:12:50,880
What's going on?

1135
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:56,560
Grandpa! Help grandpa,
they'll kill me.

1136
02:12:58,440 --> 02:13:00,360
The sinner will get the
punishment and not the innocent.

1137
02:13:00,560 --> 02:13:04,080
Leave him. - Grandpa, he has committed
grave sin. He has burnt the crop.

1138
02:13:04,880 --> 02:13:08,360
I know everything, but not
you, law will punish him.

1139
02:13:09,240 --> 02:13:12,600
By burning crops, he has not only
betrayed the village but entire nation.

1140
02:13:12,880 --> 02:13:13,880
Hand him over to the police.

1141
02:13:14,600 --> 02:13:18,240
No. I'll do whatever you want me to.
Spare me.

1142
02:13:18,720 --> 02:13:19,880
Hello. - God bless you.

1143
02:13:20,680 --> 02:13:24,040
Grandpa, vishal is
a changed man now.

1144
02:13:24,360 --> 02:13:26,040
Really. - There he is.

1145
02:13:26,080 --> 02:13:26,880
Vishal!

1146
02:13:28,600 --> 02:13:31,400
Vishal, get up!

1147
02:13:32,200 --> 02:13:35,160
No, don't let me get up.

1148
02:13:36,200 --> 02:13:40,880
I can't feel happier or
complete anywhere else.

1149
02:13:41,840 --> 02:13:45,880
You're right son, get up.

1150
02:13:50,680 --> 02:13:58,880
My, Vishal. Do you know
it's your birthday today?

1151
02:14:01,640 --> 02:14:04,520
Where's my gift then?

1152
02:14:05,280 --> 02:14:08,840
This year you do deserve a gift!

1153
02:14:26,520 --> 02:14:27,080
Grandpa!

1154
02:14:29,800 --> 02:14:32,760
You'll now manage
your dad's business.

1155
02:14:33,800 --> 02:14:34,560
I won't go anywhere grandpa.

1156
02:14:35,040 --> 02:14:43,440
This is where my father started
the business, I'll live here!

1157
02:14:44,880 --> 02:14:46,200
I want the same for you son!

1158
02:14:49,800 --> 02:14:50,560
Come with me.

1159
02:14:57,400 --> 02:15:01,400
Seek Kalandar's blessings. - No.

1160
02:15:03,240 --> 02:15:08,160
You don't need
blessings anymore son!

1161
02:15:09,720 --> 02:15:14,560
May peace be with you.
- Which Shanti?

1162
02:15:16,640 --> 02:15:21,680
"The soil of this earth
is like Sandal,"

1163
02:15:22,400 --> 02:15:24,880
"we'll put a vermilion on
our forehead and sing."

1164
02:15:25,400 --> 02:15:27,360
"Flowers bloom in every garden!"

1165
02:15:27,640 --> 02:15:30,280
"Flowers bloom in every garden!"

1166
02:15:30,560 --> 02:15:33,000
"Flowers bloom in every garden!"
