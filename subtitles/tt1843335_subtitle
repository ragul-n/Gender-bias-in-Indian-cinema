1
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,520
Is the auto for hire?
- No. The auto has broken down.

2
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,720
Who is that girl?
- She is a passenger.

3
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,280
What happened to her?
Why is she sitting like this?

4
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,880
I think she is ill.

5
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,080
Hello?
Excuse me. Are you alright?

6
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,120
Hello?

7
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:02,280
'YUDDHAM SEI'

8
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,120
Where's Alex?
- Sir? - Where's Alex?

9
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,200
He has gone to Vellore CMC.
- Why? - We have got a lead.

10
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,200
So he has gone to CMC Hospital.
- Where's Pugazhenthi?

11
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,240
He's on medical leave.
- Go to hell!

12
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,640
JK? Will you please come here?

13
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,280
JK, Will you come in?

14
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,800
What's this? - I need
three months medical leave.

15
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:23,200
JK, the Commissioner called me.
He said it's a sensational case.

16
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,520
Give it to somebody else.

17
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,240
Alex is on Savita's case.
Pugazhenthi is on leave.

18
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,920
You are the only one who's left.

19
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,120
I have got some work.

20
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,240
It's been three months since
case 56 was closed.

21
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,320
I am going to reopen it.

22
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,360
The Commissioner wants a right
man for this job. - It isn't me.

23
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,440
You are the best man in my team.
- I need to go, sir.

24
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,040
The CBCID cannot investigate
a law and order case. - They can.

25
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,640
What is this?
- It's my resignation.

26
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,720
Okay, let's have a deal.
You start on this case.

27
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,400
I'll request permission
to investigate your sister's case.

28
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,120
I give you my work.
Please, JK.

29
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,080
He is Mr. JK.
He will be your superior.

30
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,400
Follow him closely.
You will learn a lot from him.

31
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,160
Sir, I'm Prakash.
- Where's the corpse?

32
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,240
It is at Stanley.
- Male or female?

33
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,760
There were two severed hands
in a cardboard box.

34
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,800
JK, these are the profiles
of these two.

35
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,800
'Smoking is injurious to health.'

36
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,560
Oh, no! - Who's Narayanan?
The body of Ekambaram has come.

37
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,200
Judas..

38
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,120
J. Krishnamurti.
- That isn't my name.

39
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,520
But that name suits you.

40
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,520
Are you new?
- I have been SI for two years.

41
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,080
I have been with corpses
for 28 years.

42
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,680
JK has been for nine years.

43
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,240
Judas, the severed arms case
has to be given to the CBCID.

44
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,520
It has been transferred.
- Show us the details.

45
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,720
Whose corpse is this?

46
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,160
Samantha.

47
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,520
Suicide by hanging.

48
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,280
Due to the neighbour's complaint,
it has been brought for autopsy.

49
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,080
Is it a murder?
- No. Suicide.

50
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,880
But she has been raped before that.

51
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,040
Her parents were begging me.

52
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,600
They wanted a certificate
that there had been no rape.

53
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,440
What are you going to report?

54
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,800
JK..

55
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,640
Here, hold this.

56
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,640
These belong to a male.

57
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,160
By the decomposition rate,
it has been cut 48 hours earlier.

58
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,080
By bone ossification, the man's age
would be around 28 to 36 years.

59
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,800
What was the weapon used?

60
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,440
There were chips of bone.
It was surely an electric saw.

61
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,120
How about this wound?

62
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:42,960
The hands must have been tied up.
There were some saw dust too.

63
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,320
The arms must have been severed off
while the person was alive.

64
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,960
These were the wood splinters
in the fingernails.

65
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,720
Is there any chance that the person
could be still alive?

66
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,080
He has to find that out.

67
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,480
The observer is being observed.

68
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,760
J. Krishnamurti.

69
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,400
Come..

70
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,840
Is this it?
- No. - Go.

71
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,320
Next!

72
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,240
Is this it?
- No. - Go.

73
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,880
Is this it?
- No.

74
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,280
Next!

75
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,040
Is this it?
- No.

76
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,640
Next..

77
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,080
Sir, what was your report
about the dead girl?

78
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,440
I wrote that there was no rape.
- But it was a rape, wasn't it?

79
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,360
I had a girl of her age.

80
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,920
Had?
- She is dead.

81
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,640
Oh, no! You died!

82
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,760
Stop crying.
What's your husband's name?

83
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,400
Murthy.

84
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,000
Does this arm belong
to your husband? - Yes, it is.

85
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,400
The circlet on his hand
is my 'Minji'.

86
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,320
God! Why do I have to see the arm
that beats me in such a state!

87
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,600
When did you last
see your husband?

88
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,520
He went out for work.
He didn't return after that.

89
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,280
When? - Three days back.
He didn't return.

90
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,360
I even complained to the police.
But now..

91
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,960
Is your husband's auto rickshaw's
registration 3233?

92
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,480
I don't know. - Is there a picture
of Sachin Tendulkar in it?

93
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,480
Yes.

94
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,400
It was parked in a corner
inside Chockalingam Colony.

95
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,680
Who gave you information
about the auto?

96
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,520
The Ghurkha who patrols
here at night.

97
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,760
In which direction
was the auto facing?

98
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,360
Towards Thenampettai.

99
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,000
Don't make me do such things.

100
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,720
If this gets out,
I'll lose my job.

101
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,040
Did you get me all the records?

102
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,000
The records are up to date
from the month of February.

103
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,200
Get me some booze on the way.

104
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,840
There is money in that cover.
Go and drink. Get out now.

105
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,280
Drat! Pest! Why can't you remain
silent if you see something?

106
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,680
This has become a torture.

107
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,720
Child, did you see the auto..
- Why are you disturbing me?

108
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,600
I didn't see anybody.
Only an auto was parked there.

109
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,920
You told the police that someone
was repairing the auto..

110
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,720
I have told everything
to the police!

111
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,080
Did you see this girl
that day?

112
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,600
No. I did not.

113
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,320
Who's this? Is she your lover?
- Hey, fool! That's his sister.

114
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,800
Please, tell me. Did this girl
hire an auto on 6th of September?

115
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,840
Hey, didn't your wife elope
with Ravi on that day? - Shut up!

116
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,080
Please try to remember.
Did my sister hire an auto?

117
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,120
Buy us tea.

118
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,720
There were no passengers that day.
We went home early.

119
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,360
Sir, didn't you go for the last
hire at 8:20 PM? - Yes, I did.

120
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,840
You saw an auto, didn't you?
- Yes, I said so.

121
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,000
Was the girl inside?
- It was raining heavily.

122
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,440
I couldn't see anything.

123
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,720
Sir, please think again.

124
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,800
I drive an auto because
I am an illiterate. Just go.

125
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,640
Who's Surendran?

126
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,080
Who are you calling me
by name?

127
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,520
I am Policeman.
- Which station do you belong?

128
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,480
CBCID.
- So what?

129
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,400
Is the girl in it too?

130
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,080
What was the quarrel between
you and Murthy who worked for you?

131
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,560
Why? What's the matter?
- He has been murdered.

132
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,960
Oh, is it so?

133
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,800
Didn't he work here?
What was the quarrel?

134
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,440
He asked me a lot of questions.
I gave him a tight slap.

135
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,440
Hey, do you want to come
to the police station and answer?

136
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,880
Hey, look at this girl here!

137
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,320
Hey, Surendran!
- Hey, pour the tea.

138
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:36,040
Hey, why are you showing off
your CBCID authority?

139
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,400
Not even one Policeman
has come into my shed.

140
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,800
Go, ask somebody else.

141
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,840
Just push off!

142
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,760
Surendran!
- Who's that?

143
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,160
Tell me. What was the quarrel
between you and Murthy?

144
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,960
He pawned my wife's jewels
for Rs. 15,000 instead of 10,000.

145
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,320
I asked him why.

146
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,040
He started justifying himself.
I beat him up with the guys.

147
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,160
That was the quarrel.

148
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,640
What did Murthy do then?

149
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,360
He brought Rajamanickam
and solved the issue.

150
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,280
I told him that I don't want
to see him again.

151
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,880
He went off.

152
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,680
Who's Rajamanickam?

153
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,720
He is a graveyard keeper.

154
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,480
What?
- A graveyard keeper.

155
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,000
Where does your son work?

156
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,640
He was working at a courier office.
But he dropped it.

157
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,000
He has been unemployed
for an year.

158
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,280
What is your son's
phone number?

159
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,240
It's written on that calendar.

160
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,800
When did you buy this TV?

161
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,320
My son bought it last month.

162
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,840
Didn't you ask him
how he got the money?

163
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:48,320
I asked him. But he said
that he won at gambling.

164
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,560
Has your son got any vehicle?
- Yes, a motorbike.

165
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,760
The call is going through.

166
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,640
Okay, hang up.

167
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,720
Prakash, enquire with the pawn
broker mentioned by Surendran.

168
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,760
Kittappa.
- Sir?

169
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,480
We have to enquire Murthy's house
again. We have to check it too.

170
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,480
See whether he has bought
some other things besides the TV.

171
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,560
Okay.

172
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,000
We have identified only one victim.
The other remains unidentified.

173
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,600
Enquire whether any of Murthy's
friends are missing. - Yes, I will.

174
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,160
Kittappa, I don't think this case
would end soon.

175
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,680
Sir, this is just a quarrel between
ruffians.

176
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,920
They must have severed the arms
to warn others.

177
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,760
We'll solve it soon.

178
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,280
No, ruffians won't use
an electric saw.

179
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,800
And the hand wasn't lying
on the road.

180
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,800
The new year was celebrated
in the park where the AC jogs

181
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,080
and the arm was thrown
where the crowd gathered.

182
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,600
Okay, what might be the motive?

183
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,200
I don't understand.

184
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,000
I don't understand anything.

185
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,960
Stop the vehicle.

186
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,720
His home isn't here, right?
- The girl was lost here.

187
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,520
Who's that?
- His sister.

188
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,520
How did she get lost?

189
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,520
Don't know.
We haven't got a clue.

190
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,760
She came out of her friend's
house at 8:30 PM.

191
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,200
No one knows what happened
after that.

192
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,880
The police tried everything
for three months.

193
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,400
But no news of her.

194
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,000
Poor man! He goes about
half dead.

195
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:48,320
Why is he standing there?
- The girl's phone was lying there.

196
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,880
Do you know him for long?
- When he was a SI in Minjur

197
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,480
I was a constable there.

198
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,440
He kept me by his side
till the end.

199
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,400
Why did he move from law
and enforcement to CBCID?

200
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,280
He is honest. It is the price
one has to pay for being honest.

201
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,960
So he got himself transferred
to CBCID.

202
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,800
All these nine years, he worked
without taking a day off.

203
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,320
He keeps working all the time
and never got married.

204
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,560
Where are his parents?

205
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,000
Sir, where are his parents?

206
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,120
On the way back from Tirupathi,
the taxi that they were travelling

207
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,200
hit a lorry and they both died
on the spot.

208
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,320
Tell them to clear off.
No photos allowed.

209
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,600
Tell them to go back.

210
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,800
Please come.

211
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:15,680
Oh, no!
Rajamanickam!

212
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,680
Who has done this heinous deed!

213
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,600
Oh, my dear!

214
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:35,120
Rajamanickam!
You left me.

215
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,040
Sir, who do you think the arms
that displayed first belong to?

216
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,360
If you notice the records
of the two victims

217
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,720
the police have not given
a clean status.

218
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:47,160
So we believe that the remaining
victim is also a criminal.

219
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,520
What do you think is the motive?

220
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:55,240
It is mysterious.
Severed arms put in public places.

221
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,800
Everything is a preplanned action.

222
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,720
Why did they throw
it on the streets?

223
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,160
We haven't got a clear picture
about that.

224
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,440
Only the arms have been found.
Could the victims be alive?

225
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,240
We will be happy if they are alive.

226
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,880
We are trying hard
to find them.

227
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,520
Will this continue?
- I beg your pardon?

228
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,160
Will these incidents continue?

229
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,600
That's all for today.
We have a lot to do. - Sir..

230
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,280
The Ladies hostel serial killing
case which the police had dropped

231
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,240
was solved by you when you found
murderer, Arun Siddharth.

232
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,000
Will you solve this case too?

233
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:32,320
Mr. JK, do you think
your missing sister is still alive?

234
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,720
Are you out of your mind?
Please leave.

235
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,800
Are your facts right?
- Yes, sir. - On the street?

236
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,440
Same area?
Are you sure?

237
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:15,000
Listen, Rajamanickam's bike
is parked at Triplicane.

238
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,240
The area constable has seen it.
He's still there.

239
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,080
Is he in Mufti?
- Yes.

240
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,840
What shall we do now?

241
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,280
Constable - Sir.
- How did you find the bike?

242
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,960
We received information
from the Commissioner's office.

243
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,720
Since it was a Yezdi,
I found it easily.

244
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,520
Murugesh!

245
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,080
Have you seen this person
in the photograph?

246
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,360
Yes. He used to come here.

247
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,400
Last night, this guy was here.
I bought him booze.

248
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,440
Which room?
- 312.

249
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,920
Hey, show him the room no. 312.
- Come with me.

250
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,360
This is room no. 312.

251
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,480
Do you have the deceased's address?
- Yes, I do.

252
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,360
It is a small village
near Pudukottai.

253
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,160
Was anyone else staying with him?

254
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,480
Three months back, he brought
a friend and shared the room.

255
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,600
Is it so?
What is his name?

256
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,600
His name is Jon Britto.
- Where does he work?

257
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,960
I don't know. He hasn't been here
for a month and a half.

258
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,400
Sir, from the missing people list
for six months

259
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,920
Jon Britto has been missing
since the 8th of November.

260
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:48,320
He left home last August.
He went off to stay with Raghu.

261
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,800
How does your brother
and Raghu know each other?

262
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,040
They studied diploma together
at Chettinad Polytechnic.

263
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,400
When did you last
see your brother?

264
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,560
He called my wife on the 5th
of November asking for money.

265
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,640
On 10th November, Raghu called
and asked me where Britto was.

266
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,080
I was confused.

267
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,880
He went to Abhirami Theatre
to watch a movie

268
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,520
on the 8th but never returned.

269
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,280
We gave a complaint on the 12th.

270
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:13,880
But till now we don't know
what happened to him.

271
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,400
Why did he go out
to stay in a mansion?

272
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,920
He didn't. I sent him out.

273
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,640
He was full of lies.
He brought a man to humiliation.

274
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,840
Who?
- Dr. Purushothaman.

275
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,000
What was the name again?

276
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,000
Dr. Purushothaman,
who was the dean at the GH.

277
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,560
Sir, he committed suicide
with his family in September.

278
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,920
'Sorry, no comments. I have told
everything to the police.'

279
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,520
'Please!
- One question please.'

280
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,960
'We found out a DD worth
Rs. 60,000'

281
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,200
'in his wife, Annapoorani's name
in Dr. Purushothaman's drawer.'

282
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,200
'He is a leading heart surgeon
in our country.'

283
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,160
'But the police have found
that he received bribes.'

284
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,560
'I don't have any comments
on that. But I'll tell you this.'

285
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,160
Purushothaman is my friend.
He is very honest.

286
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,080
What the hell?
Who are you? What do you want?

287
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,800
You could have called..
- What's happening?

288
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,600
Please be seated.

289
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,600
Can I have a smoke?
- Sure.

290
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,560
This is such a shame for
the law enforcement

291
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,280
to have given this
case to the CBCID.

292
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,600
This is very sensitive
and sensational.

293
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,760
That is why I gave it to you.

294
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,040
We know, sir.
- The CM is yelling over the phone.

295
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,400
I need your help.
- We are with you. We'll solve it.

296
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,120
Drat!
Tell me what the lead is.

297
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,600
How are Rajamanickam
and Raghu related?

298
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,440
We aren't very clear about it.

299
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,000
But Raghu has known something
about Rajamanickam.

300
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,120
Raghu has been murdered
in order to cover that up.

301
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,920
Who? Those who display
those severed arms?

302
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,400
We are still..
- No, sir. - What?

303
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,080
Raghu was murdered
by someone else.

304
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,520
The ones who display the arms
are somebody else.

305
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,800
How? How can you be so certain?

306
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,080
Raghu's murder was to silence him.

307
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,840
But the arms were displayed
to convey something.

308
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,760
What? What's he saying?

309
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,880
Sir.

310
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,680
Both the vehicles
of Rajamanickam and Murthy

311
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,360
whose arms have been displayed
were discarded on the road.

312
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,840
They were both followed
and kidnapped.

313
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,280
There was wood splinters
in their fingernails.

314
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,600
The elbows bear marks
of being bound.

315
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,800
The victims have been tortured.

316
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,640
The arms have been wrapped
in similar plastic covers

317
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,840
and put in similar cartons.

318
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,600
These arms have been displayed
in public places.

319
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:44,800
For easy identification, the rings
and circlets have been left.

320
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,520
So everything is in the same
pattern. It is well designed.

321
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,800
But Raghu's murder
was committed hastily.

322
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,280
What's the next lead?

323
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,600
Britto who was staying with Raghu,
is the lead.

324
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,440
How is Britto related
to this case?

325
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,720
Britto has complained that he
has given Rs. 60,000 as bribe

326
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,160
to late Dr. Purushothaman.

327
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,040
Britto's brother has been supplying
surgical instruments

328
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,320
to Dr. Purushothaman
for the past ten years.

329
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,320
When enquired, he said that Dr.
Purushothaman was very honest.

330
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,240
So why did Britto lie?

331
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,680
Is Rs. 60,000 really the reason
for a family suicide?

332
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,200
What do we do next?

333
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,480
We need to reopen
Dr. Purushothaman's case.

334
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,200
Go ahead.
I give you my permission.

335
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,840
Thank you, sir.

336
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,960
And you are doing a good job.
- Thank you, sir.

337
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:45,280
Dr. Purushothaman's suicide
was our newspaper's exclusive news.

338
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,400
The bribe was just an accusation.
It was never proved.

339
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,120
Why should he commit suicide?

340
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,120
Didn't this question
occur to you?

341
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,440
There was a report
on the doctor's wife too.

342
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,480
What report?

343
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,360
In the college in where she worked,
a 19 year old lab assistant..

344
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,440
she..
- What?

345
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,280
A report came in
that she called him for sex.

346
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,160
We never published that.
It could have been a rumour.

347
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,520
I didn't want her reputation
to be spoiled.

348
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,400
We have requested the files
of accused who are over six feet.

349
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,640
Murthy and Rajamanickam's houses
are being watched by men in mufti.

350
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,440
I enquired in the college in which
the wife of the doctor had worked.

351
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:31,360
Everyone spoke highly of her.
The students too.

352
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,560
The management,
being a women's college

353
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:37,080
had suspended her
in order to avoid sex scandals.

354
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,520
The peon, Manikantan
was spoken ill of everywhere.

355
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,160
He seems to have borrowed money
from most of the students.

356
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,120
Did you investigate him?
- I went to his house.

357
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,760
What did you get?
- We got nothing. - What?

358
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,240
He has been missing
since the 8th of November.

359
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,880
Hi.

360
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,960
Ajay, I can spend
only half an hour with you.

361
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,160
What? You said we can go out,
didn't you?

362
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,920
I did, but I forgot
that today's Friday.

363
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,800
Our family is going
to Kapaleeshwarar temple.

364
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,360
I'm sorry.
We'll go next week.

365
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,240
Dad starts asking questions
even if I'm a bit late.

366
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,680
Here. Have some iced tea.
- Thanks.

367
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,640
Durga? What happened?

368
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,680
What happened?
- I don't know.

369
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,120
I feel dizzy after drinking this.

370
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,040
You said that you wanted
to go home in half an hour, right?

371
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,320
Oh, God!
Stop. I'll get down.

372
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,720
Bye.
- Goodbye!

373
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,320
Stop.

374
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,320
Ma'am, I have given every file
regarding the family.

375
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,280
It's getting late.
I have to go home.

376
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,600
Read them and return it.
- Okay, thanks.

377
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:58,080
Sir!
- What?

378
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,800
The dead doctor
had a daughter named Suja.

379
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,760
And she has gone missing.

380
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:06,520
When? - 6th of September,
the day that your sister was lost.

381
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:43,400
Tell me. - You handled
Dr. Purushothaman's case, right?

382
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,960
Hey, bring me some tea!
Tell me.

383
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,800
You handled
Dr. Purushothaman's case, right?

384
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,040
That fraudster!

385
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:54,840
The accusations weren't proven.
- He committed suicide fearing it.

386
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,320
He committed suicide with
the whole family.

387
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,000
His wife is a bad egg.

388
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,920
Why did the boy commit suicide?
- I don't know.

389
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,800
How can you close the file
without finding the motive?

390
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:06,280
What else could be the motive?
He must have been ashamed.

391
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:08,640
The man is a fraudster.
The woman was lecherous.

392
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:09,920
The girl eloped with someone.

393
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,400
The girl was lost.

394
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,280
Yes. But she must have eloped.

395
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,200
She boarded an auto
after her dance classes.

396
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,720
But she never reached home.
- I investigated too.

397
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,240
Her brother usually picks her up
from dance classes.

398
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,440
His brother had an accident
that day.

399
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,560
So she took the chance and eloped.

400
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,720
The neighbours spoke well
of the girl.

401
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:33,000
Why are you so innocent?
Hey, bring the tea soon!

402
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,320
The women are very cunning
these days.

403
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,160
Do you know who this is?

404
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:42,560
Sir! Sir, you came to investigate
the suicide case, right?

405
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:43,720
I have got a lot of work to do.

406
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:47,120
Mr. Isakkimuthu, the commissioner
has given the CBCID

407
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,720
special permission
to investigate this case.

408
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,320
Will you talk here? Or should we
escort you to our office?

409
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,240
Sit down.

410
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,160
Tell me. - Do you know
who this is? - Duraipandi.

411
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:03,800
You closed Duraipandi's case..
- What?

412
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:08,760
You handled the case against him
by Purushothaman, right?

413
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:11,280
Yes.
- Tell me about it.

414
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,720
I received a complaint
last February.

415
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:21,800
Hey, come in.
- Come in and say that.

416
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,600
How dare you do such a thing!
- Come in!

417
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:32,600
Who are you? Are you a Policeman?
How dare you beat him!

418
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,560
This guy was peeping at women
changing in the trial rooms.

419
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:39,760
Hey, file an FIR on these men
for being a ruffian in the station.

420
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,520
What did we do?

421
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,040
He is the guilty one.
- Take your hands off him!

422
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,560
Complain to us
if he has done something wrong.

423
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,240
Why did you beating him up?

424
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,880
Who gave you the authority
to do that?

425
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,040
Give me a written complaint
of what he has done.

426
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,480
I'll take him to the court
and get him punished.

427
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,280
Who are you to judge him?

428
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,800
How dare you beat him!
Please come.

429
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,440
Sit down.

430
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,600
Give this man some water.

431
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,520
Someone tell me exactly
what had happened.

432
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,720
Sir, I work in a software company.
- Cut to the point.

433
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,960
My wife and I went to a shop
to purchase clothes.

434
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:13,800
This man was peeping at the women
changing clothes in the trial room.

435
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:17,000
Whose wife did he see?
Yours? - No. - Who else? Yours?

436
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:20,560
No. - Yours? - No.
- Whom did he see then?

437
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,640
They are outside.
- Outside?

438
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,720
Whom did he see?

439
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,440
Whom did he see?

440
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,960
I got the complaint. But Duraipandi
was proved innocent at court.

441
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,400
The manager of his shop accepted
that he was guilty.

442
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,480
Did he accept it
or take the blame on himself?

443
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,600
Ask the judge
who gave the judgment.

444
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,040
Mr. Duraipandi, regarding the case
of you peeping at women..

445
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,080
Sorry. I didn't peep.

446
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:32,640
There's a case against you filed by
the doctor's family, right?

447
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:37,080
Yes - You have long sight and can't
see anything without glasses.

448
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,840
So, the judge acquitted you, right?

449
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,280
Yes. - How long had your manager
been working for you?

450
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,320
Nadhamani, was working in my mill
for about 8 years.

451
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:51,560
I thought him to be trustworthy
and made him a manager here.

452
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,160
I didn't expect that he would do
such a thing.

453
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,160
Your office room was exactly
behind the dressing room, right?

454
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,880
The office washroom was there.

455
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,280
You used to be alone
in the office, right?

456
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,800
I used to go there twice a week.
The manager would be there.

457
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,360
And the washroom?
- I have never used it.

458
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,240
What did you do
when the problem occurred?

459
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:36,680
I was at the store, checking
the Ludhiana stock files.

460
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:39,120
Suddenly I heard some noise.

461
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,000
The manager came running
out of the washroom

462
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,920
and started crying at my feet.
I asked him what had happened.

463
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:48,000
Break the glass!
- There's a room in there.

464
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:54,520
Hey, who's in there?
Come out.. Who's there?

465
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,720
Beat him up!

466
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:01,080
Hey, who's the owner?
Let's thrash him up.

467
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:11,520
Did you see?
Who was it?

468
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,160
Check there.

469
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:27,960
Hey, who was it?

470
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,880
Hey, a guy is hiding here.

471
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,520
A mob.
It was such a rough mob.

472
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,760
I was sitting down
due to fear.

473
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:01,400
They beat me up
and never listened to me.

474
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,560
They dragged me
to the police station.

475
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,520
All the respect, reputation
and name I had in the society

476
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,960
was ruined in a single day
by the doctor's family..

477
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:17,560
My son! My own son!
He slapped me with his slippers.

478
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,120
The clothes shop which was turning
profits up to Rs. 6 crores

479
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,160
was forced to be closed
in a day.

480
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,880
Who is your ophthalmologist?

481
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:35,640
I don't remember.

482
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:42,120
The manager is in Puzhal jail.
Should we enquire him?

483
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,280
We won't get anything out of him.

484
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:44,800
He'll say that he is guilty.

485
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:51,840
Have you seen the film, Rashomon?
- What film is that? English?

486
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:58,000
Isakkimuthu and Duraipandi were
telling their version of the story.

487
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,680
But we don't know
whether that is the truth.

488
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:04,920
We'll get to know it
gradually.

489
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:18,320
Look.
All charred bodies.

490
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:19,960
How was it proved as suicide?

491
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,640
The police say that the door
was locked from the inside.. - No..

492
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,280
How did you prove it
in your autopsy report?

493
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:32,400
See. This is a male.
And this is a female.

494
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,440
By the growth of her thigh bones

495
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:41,160
We can estimate this as above 40
and this as above 50.

496
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:45,840
This belongs to the youth man.
It must be their son.

497
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,480
But this is completely charred!

498
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,960
This a passport size photograph
of Dr. Purushothaman.

499
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:08,600
We have enlarged it.

500
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:11,520
This is the skull dimension
of the dead body.

501
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:13,480
Both these images match.

502
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:25,920
This is his wife.
It was taken from her photograph.

503
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,840
This skull dimension
fits too.

504
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,120
This is their son.

505
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,840
This skull dimension matches too.

506
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:47,200
But you know, the most important
evidence is this.

507
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:53,600
The boy had a fractured
right ankle during the suicide.

508
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:59,560
And this body has the fracture
at the exact spot.

509
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:05,120
So that's the whole story.

510
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,920
Why can't this be a murder?
- No. It can't be.

511
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:13,320
There are no injuries on the head.
And no other fractures on the body.

512
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,560
What if someone had poisoned them?

513
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:23,800
You know, J. Krishnamurti
used to read a lot of novels.

514
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,920
I think you read
a lot of fiction too.

515
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,920
Who called you saying that Suja
had an accident?

516
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Someone. They called from
her brother's mobile phone.

517
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,040
I told her to confirm
it by calling her home.

518
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:53,080
She called home.
Even her mother had got a call.

519
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:56,920
Her dad had gone to the hospital
and her mom told her to come home.

520
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:57,960
So, I sent her immediately.

521
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:01,360
Did the auto leave as soon as
she got in?

522
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,800
I remember that the auto
had some trouble starting.

523
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:09,200
Immediately a guy went to the rear
and started repairing it.

524
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,800
When the one in the front tried,
the auto started.

525
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,760
So were there two drivers in it?
- Yes.

526
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,600
Did you tell this to the police?
- They didn't ask me anything.

527
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,960
Mister, are you crazy?
How many times have I told you!

528
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:33,200
Why are you disturbing us?

529
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,440
Shut your mouth!
Go in.

530
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,800
If you talk, I'll arrest you
for prostitution. Go in!

531
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,520
Only one man was sitting
at the rear and was repairing.

532
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:35,040
Sir, there was someone else
in the driver's seat.

533
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:36,400
I saw that.

534
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:51,840
Thanks. Thank you so much.

535
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:01,840
Kittappa, I have some faith.
- Will your sister be found?

536
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,960
If we find out what happened
to the doctor's daughter

537
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:05,520
we can find out what happened
to Charu.

538
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:06,640
How?

539
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:09,880
There's some relationship between
her disappearance and Charu's.

540
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,080
This is the shortest route
for the girl to go home.

541
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,640
He didn't believe anything I said.

542
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:30,080
He wheedled the truth
out my own mouth.

543
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:31,480
Why did you answer
them in the first place?

544
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:32,760
I couldn't help it.

545
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:34,840
He was sitting right in front
and staring at me.

546
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,360
Like this. He was staring at me
like this!

547
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:41,800
Not only him.
Two others too. With accusing eyes.

548
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:45,040
And a girl too.
She was very lovely.

549
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:48,520
The case has been closed, right?
Why do you worry now?

550
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,800
Closed? JK is cunning.

551
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,960
He'll probe at it again.

552
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:57,040
Hey, Thirisangu!
I'm very afraid.

553
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:00,880
If JK comes again,
I'll spill the beans.

554
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:18,400
You realise it now, don't you?

555
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,320
You should have stayed put.

556
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:23,080
You shouldn't have peeped
inside the dressing room.

557
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:31,720
Sheriff, Inba. Don't do any shows
till I tell you.

558
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,440
Lay low for a few days.

559
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,120
There have been no shows
for almost a month.

560
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:40,560
Our business is doing good.
- You, fool!

561
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,920
The show will go on only if Nagu,
Murthy and Rajamanickam are here.

562
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:46,760
They are missing
and you say there's no trouble!

563
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,520
Somebody is playing with us.

564
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:50,400
It isn't a game.

565
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:53,640
Some clever guy is opposing us.

566
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,240
Thirisangu, help me escape.

567
00:59:56,440 --> 01:00:00,560
I'll go off on a pilgrimage.
I am not brave enough to die.

568
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,720
Hey, you go in.

569
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:23,080
Kittappa.

570
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:43,000
Who's it?
- It's my son.

571
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:45,720
Where's your son?
- We don't allow him in.

572
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:48,320
We know that there are cases
registered against him.

573
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:50,440
We have to think about
our daughter's life.

574
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:52,560
So I told him that I'll call
the police if he returns home.

575
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:55,000
He hasn't come here
for almost a year.

576
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:56,920
What did he do now?

577
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:00,320
Father.
- Go in, dear. I'll come.

578
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:04,280
Does your son have any friends?
- I don't know.

579
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:07,920
Has he got a bike?
- A black Yamaha.

580
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:51,320
Tell me.

581
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:55,280
Poonkundran..

582
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:06,400
Devarsangan.
Sengundran.

583
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:10,640
Sampath.
Duraipandi.

584
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:13,560
Singaram.

585
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:25,760
Mister, what shall we do?
- Let's go and surrender.

586
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:27,520
Or else, let's shoot ourselves
in the head and die.

587
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:30,000
Here, shoot yourself.

588
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:34,560
Sir! Our men who went to kill JK,
got caught.

589
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:36,560
Sheriff's house was raided.

590
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:38,000
That rascal is missing.

591
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:40,800
If Sheriff gets caught,
we'll be ruined.

592
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:43,880
Hey, shut your mouth!
- How can I? JK has ruined us.

593
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:51,000
He has found out our crimes.
He'll hang us soon.

594
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:57,040
I want to know what the girls
we held shows are doing now.

595
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:00,680
I need to know where Suja is.

596
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:04,000
After that..
- What about JK?

597
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:07,120
...we'll take care of it.

598
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:10,000
The club has totally 221 members.

599
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:11,800
There are eight game divisions.

600
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:15,640
Pokers, Swimming, Chess, Carom,
Table Tennis, Football..

601
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:16,880
Are there divisions
in tennis?

602
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,280
Yes.
- How many in total?

603
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:19,720
23 members.

604
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:22,600
I need the address and phone number
of all those 23 people immediately.

605
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:24,120
Sure. I'll get it.

606
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:05,880
Sir, greetings!

607
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:28,640
"It is a letter
that arrives quickly."

608
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:46,640
Oh, no!

609
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:50,720
Go! Go..

610
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:58,520
"It will run
and follow you"

611
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:02,960
"and say that I'm your trouble."

612
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:06,840
"It will return.."

613
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:10,520
"Your staff that brings the light."

614
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:44,280
No! Please, no..
Please go away.

615
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:46,480
Where's JK?

616
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:48,640
Where's JK?

617
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:53,200
Sir. - This time
it's a head. Not an arm.

618
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,280
Do you have anything to say?

619
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:57,600
What theory do you have for this?
- I have one.

620
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:00,520
The head was not put out
in a public place.

621
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:02,160
It was put
in front of the police station.

622
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:05,720
That's obvious. I saw that.
- Did you see the eyes?

623
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:09,440
The eyelids have been cut off.
So that the eyes remain open.

624
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:11,120
Tell me clearly.

625
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:18,200
This station has a lot of garbage.
- Give me a straightforward answer.

626
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:19,680
Those eyes are watching something.

627
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:25,240
It's searching for someone.

628
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:44,360
Somebody get some cigarettes.

629
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:49,160
Please listen to me.

630
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:53,440
Are you mad? I have power only
in CBCID not in Law and Order.

631
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:54,840
Get the Commissioner's permission.

632
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:56,320
How? How can I ask him?

633
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:58,320
How can I ask him permission
to overhear phone calls

634
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:00,600
of an AC and an Inspector
in his department?

635
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:02,360
The Commissioner would insult me.

636
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:05,160
Already he is being shouted at
by the CM.

637
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:06,920
And if we blame his department..

638
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:09,720
JK, leave it.
Ask me something else.

639
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,360
Then we'll arrest the AC
and the Inspector.

640
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:14,840
What? What do you mean?

641
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,120
On what grounds
will you arrest them?

642
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:19,320
The second arm was put out
in the park

643
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:21,480
where the AC Thirisangu
goes for walks.

644
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:23,720
All the other head
and arms have been put

645
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:27,800
in the same AC's
area of jurisdiction.

646
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:30,040
Dr. Purushothaman has complained
in this station

647
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:31,480
that his daughter was missing.

648
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:35,160
Mr. Isakkimuthu, the SI
has handled his case.

649
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:39,400
The death of Dr. Purushothaman's
family as suicide was filed there.

650
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:41,520
Everything is connected
to that station.

651
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:45,160
So? So, what?

652
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:48,680
One more thing.

653
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:50,560
After the Commissioner's
press meet

654
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:53,040
when we got news from
the constable at Triplicane

655
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:54,320
that Rajamanickam's bike
had been found

656
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:55,560
there were eight people
with us.

657
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:58,560
And one among them
was AC Thirisangu.

658
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:07,040
Give me a cigarette!

659
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:14,880
Sorry, JK. I can't do it.
Ask me something else.

660
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:16,480
Get me a weapons permit.

661
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:20,480
What?
- I need a gun from the armoury.

662
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:21,920
Get me a letter.

663
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:22,080
Eat.
- Let me out. I want to go. Please.

664
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:27,520
What did I do?
Why have you locked me up?

665
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,160
You should have gone home
straight from your friend's house.

666
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,960
Why did you ask who and why
she was in the auto?

667
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:41,880
Now you have been brought here.

668
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,320
I didn't know what to do.

669
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:49,160
Why did you kidnap her?

670
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:52,280
That is my business.

671
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:54,720
What happened to her?

672
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:58,240
You are unharmed, right?
Be grateful for that.

673
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:01,240
How long will you keep me
locked up like this?

674
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:02,920
I don't know that.

675
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:07,720
I can't let you go.
And I don't wish to kill you.

676
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:12,400
But I know one thing.
I will need you someday.

677
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:17,560
My brother will nab you.
- I'm a Policeman.

678
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:20,240
I won't lose to another Policeman.

679
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:51,000
I'll be back in the morning.
- Okay, sir.

680
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:10,240
Who are you?

681
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:17,720
Hey, who are you?

682
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:40,560
Why are you sitting here?

683
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:50,080
Hey, what do you want?

684
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:52,000
What are you doing here?

685
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:57,120
What is that?

686
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:05,440
Sir.
- Wait.

687
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,440
Hey! Tamizh!

688
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:38,440
Get in!
Are you crazy?

689
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:43,280
Who told you to go after them?
- Sorry, sir. I lost them.

690
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:44,560
Idiot.

691
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:36,640
Tamizh?

692
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:48,080
Tamizh?

693
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:52,560
Tamizh..

694
01:28:15,080 --> 01:28:17,440
Hey, what are you reading?

695
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:19,320
Sleep.
- Where are you going?

696
01:28:19,480 --> 01:28:21,880
I have got some work to do.
I'll come soon.

697
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:34,920
Dr. Wasim, here. - We are calling
from Ashok Nagar police station.

698
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:36,480
I need to clarify something.

699
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:39,280
It's in our reports that you
and Dr. Purushothaman

700
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:42,000
studied MBBS in Vellore together.

701
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:44,280
Yes. That's right.

702
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:47,360
Is there anybody else who studied
with you, in Chennai?

703
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:49,400
The ones who studied with me?

704
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:54,280
Yes. There is one.
But he is not a doctor.

705
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:56,400
What's his name?

706
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:01,360
Thank you so much, Doctor.

707
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:14,400
There were two people
in the van.

708
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:17,760
Yes. I saw that too.
- One was a lady. - What?

709
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:19,200
Her head was shaved.

710
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:48,280
Sir, this was cut open.

711
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:58,000
Sir, this is the youngest corpse
in here. - Has it been claimed?

712
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:01,600
No. - There is an unnamed
16 year old corpse in this list.

713
01:32:01,680 --> 01:32:04,160
Where's it?
- What's the number? - 37.

714
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:13,880
Come here.
That's 37. But that's old.

715
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:16,320
It has been here
for five or six months.

716
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:18,800
It is an orphaned corpse.
The neck has been wrung.

717
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:23,000
Hasn't the body been disposed yet?
- The case wouldn't have ended yet.

718
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:25,920
Next month all the corpses
will be given to the graveyard.

719
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:43,840
Open it up.
It won't stink. You can look.

720
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:52,840
Hey, the body is not here!
- I don't know anything about it.

721
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:55,360
Where's the corpse of the boy?
- I don't know!

722
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:19,560
Cunning idiot! The thing he sprayed
is still making me dizzy!

723
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:24,080
We know who it is.
- Who's it?

724
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:28,200
Dr. Purushothaman's family's alive.

725
01:34:34,280 --> 01:34:35,120
Where are we going now?

726
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:37,800
To Duraipandi's house.
- It's Saturday. He won't be there.

727
01:35:10,120 --> 01:35:11,640
"Is she a maid
of the Virgin Islands"

728
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:13,600
"with beetle black eyes?"

729
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:16,440
"She sways her waist
like the oars of a catamaran"

730
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:20,360
"and tempts me with her
toddy pot lips."

731
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:22,720
"Is she a maid
of the Virgin Islands"

732
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:24,520

733
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:27,680
"She sways her waist
like the oars of a catamaran"

734
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:31,840
"and tempts me with her
toddy pot lips."

735
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:35,280
"She smiles like
a flare"

736
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:38,880
"and trod down
all our proposals."

737
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:42,520
"I forget my wife
looking at this prostitute."

738
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:46,360
"I follow her by the smell
of her clothes."

739
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:48,480
"Is she a maid
of the Virgin Islands"

740
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:50,440
"with beetle black eyes?"

741
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:53,280
"She sways her waist
like the oars of a catamaran"

742
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:57,240
"and tempts me with her
toddy pot lips."

743
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:23,680
"A tempting piece of dry fish
in a yellow sari."

744
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:26,720
"Circle around and dance,
this is the way to the rainbow."

745
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:30,520
"Don't try to water
a watermelon!"

746
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:34,560
"You are a sweet betel leaf
that is never bitter."

747
01:36:34,720 --> 01:36:37,720
"You are a Goli Soda
which makes me burp."

748
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:42,240
"You are a water lorry
that rams me to death."

749
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:45,120
"You are booze from Pondicherry
that intoxicates heavily."

750
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:48,880
"If you agree to be mine,
I'll give you my salary."

751
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:52,640
"If you slip away,
I'll cry like 'Kannagi'."

752
01:36:53,120 --> 01:36:54,800
"Is she a maid
of the Virgin Islands"

753
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:56,600
"with beetle black eyes?"

754
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:59,760
"She sways her waist
like the oars of a catamaran"

755
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:03,480
"and tempts me with her
toddy pot lips."

756
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:29,880
"Can I let my tongue
into this vanilla cake?"

757
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:33,120
"Let me burst into boils
by your firebrand tongue."

758
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:36,760
"Don't beg with
a bowl from Thanjavur."

759
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:40,600
"You are a dice meant
to be rolled and played."

760
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:43,920
"You are a slippery
banana stem."

761
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:48,280
"You are a fragrant
Kuzha puttu dish from Kerala."

762
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:51,360
"You are so insolent
that you don't turn back."

763
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:55,240
"Let's play a board game
in her cheeks."

764
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:59,120
"Cover me with kisses
and serve me a nutritious meal."

765
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:01,080
"Is she a maid
of the Virgin Islands"

766
01:38:01,240 --> 01:38:03,120

767
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:06,120
"She sways her waist

768
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:09,840
"and tempts me with her
toddy pot lips."

769
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:13,840
"She smiles like
a flare"

770
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:17,440
"and trod down
all our proposals."

771
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:21,160
"I forget my wife
looking at this prostitute."

772
01:38:21,320 --> 01:38:24,920
"I follow her by the smell

"Is she a maid

774
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:28,880
"with beetle black eyes?"

775
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:31,920
"She sways her waist

776
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:35,720
"and tempts me with her
toddy pot lips."

777
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:38,200
"Is she a maid

778
01:38:38,360 --> 01:38:39,920
"with beetle black eyes?"

779
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,920
"She sways her waist
like the oars of a catamaran"

780
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:46,680
"and tempts me with her
toddy pot lips."

781
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:20,280
Hey, you know who we are, right?
- Yes, I do.

782
01:39:23,240 --> 01:39:26,480
If what you have said isn't there,
I'll bury you alive.

783
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:30,280
Stop it. Did you shoot the video
of us watching the show?

784
01:39:31,120 --> 01:39:33,680
Yes.
- How much do you want?

785
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:35,880
The price of the ticket
you paid. - Rs. Five lakhs?

786
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:38,560
With all seven in it,
totally Rs. 35 lakhs.

787
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:39,400
What's this smoke all about?

788
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:42,840
Hey, who's that?

789
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:10,760
Mister!

790
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:19,680
Mister..
- Nishanth! Run! - Mister!

791
01:41:22,640 --> 01:41:23,680
Nishanth!

792
01:41:31,240 --> 01:41:34,120
Nishanth!
- Run!

793
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:47,040
Nishanth!

794
01:41:48,040 --> 01:41:52,440
Nishanth!
Stop the vehicle..

795
01:42:26,440 --> 01:42:29,520
Leave me..

796
01:42:29,960 --> 01:42:33,960
Judas, listen to me.
- JK, where's the kid?

797
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:35,080
Where's the kid?

798
01:42:35,160 --> 01:42:36,840
He is safe.

799
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:38,200
Take him to a safe place.

800
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:43,920
Take care of Nishanth.
- Let nobody else know of this.

801
01:42:45,720 --> 01:42:47,160
Take care of Nishanth.

802
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:53,040
Judas..

803
01:43:01,960 --> 01:43:04,880
Help me..

804
01:43:20,640 --> 01:43:25,480
JK, save him.
Save that kid.

805
01:43:25,720 --> 01:43:30,440
He'll be safe.
- No. They'll die.

806
01:43:31,880 --> 01:43:35,160
After it is done,
they'll commit suicide.

807
01:43:35,240 --> 01:43:38,320
After what?
- Their work.

808
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:41,520
The cleaning they're doing.

809
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:48,120
Judas, don't talk.

810
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:53,720
No, I must.
The family won't talk.

811
01:43:54,920 --> 01:43:57,040
No one should talk ill
of that family.

812
01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:03,240
Judas!
Constable, get us an auto.

813
01:44:03,480 --> 01:44:06,320
What for?
- Let's go to the hospital.

814
01:44:08,840 --> 01:44:11,960
No, I'm dying.

815
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:15,680
A bullet has entered
my pericardial sac.

816
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:17,720
It will create a tamponade.

817
01:44:18,360 --> 01:44:21,800
Another bullet
has blown my descending colon.

818
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:24,240
Can't you smell it?

819
01:44:27,320 --> 01:44:29,440
And my blood group
is AB negative.

820
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:32,880
It is very rare.
You can't get it easily.

821
01:44:34,120 --> 01:44:35,640
Don't try to save me.

822
01:44:43,640 --> 01:44:47,960
JK, I helped that family.

823
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:49,560
I know.

824
01:44:49,960 --> 01:44:51,520
It's very late, right?

825
01:44:54,360 --> 01:44:55,680
Judas!

826
01:44:57,400 --> 01:44:58,920
I am indebted to them.

827
01:45:00,120 --> 01:45:03,200
For protecting my child
for four years.

828
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:05,920
When my child was buried

829
01:45:06,520 --> 01:45:08,440
Purushothaman gave Suja
into my hands.

830
01:45:08,920 --> 01:45:10,520
He said, 'It is your child'.

831
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:20,360
JK, wouldn't you be happy
if you got back your sister?

832
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:27,560
But when our child Suja came back,
we couldn't be happy.

833
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:31,040
We couldn't be happy!

834
01:45:50,440 --> 01:45:54,440
When Suja was lost,
we searched for three days.

835
01:45:54,720 --> 01:45:56,440
And prayed to every God.

836
01:45:57,200 --> 01:46:00,360
And when we thought
that all was lost..

837
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:11,680
Who's it?
- Is this the Doctor's house?

838
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:14,000
Yes.
- While coming back from work

839
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:15,720
I saw the girl near
the railway crossing.

840
01:46:15,880 --> 01:46:17,080
I asked her where she wanted to go.

841
01:46:28,160 --> 01:46:31,920
Suja! Suja..

842
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:35,480
Suja.. God!

843
01:46:46,160 --> 01:46:50,880
The hands that touched dead women
to see whether they were raped

844
01:46:52,160 --> 01:46:53,880
I touched a young child!

845
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:56,440
I touched my own child!

846
01:47:02,240 --> 01:47:06,000
The mother asked me
what had happened.

847
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:09,040
I told her that

848
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:13,040
her daughter's body
has been ruined.

849
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,800
My eyes got sore
from shedding tears.

850
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:59,680
Oh, no!
Oh, no! Suja!

851
01:48:24,200 --> 01:48:29,200
For three days, the mother
was looking at her dead girl.

852
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:55,440
Mister, we need a help from you.
Will you help us?

853
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:59,040
What? - We should die.
We can't live anymore.

854
01:48:59,560 --> 01:49:03,840
We want to join our child.
Will you help us? We want to die.

855
01:49:04,040 --> 01:49:08,640
We need to die.
We can't live anymore..

856
01:49:08,840 --> 01:49:13,680
We need to die.
Purosh! Purosh..

857
01:49:14,240 --> 01:49:17,000
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

858
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:19,240
Y-You said that we should die,
right?

859
01:49:19,400 --> 01:49:24,560
Yes. I did. But we must kill
everyone who killed our child.

860
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:28,000
We should die after killing
every one of them..

861
01:49:28,720 --> 01:49:33,800
Mister, will you help us?
We need to kill them..

862
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:35,840
We need to kill everyone.

863
01:49:36,040 --> 01:49:37,480
Will you help us?
- Help for death..

864
01:49:37,560 --> 01:49:40,200
Will you help us?
- ...help for murder.

865
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:46,360
I understood what justice is.

866
01:49:46,600 --> 01:49:50,200
I brought three corpses
from the mortuary.

867
01:52:30,360 --> 01:52:32,560
The family that had lived
in a beautiful house

868
01:52:33,400 --> 01:52:36,400
buried its child
in that disgusting place

869
01:52:36,920 --> 01:52:38,400
and stayed there.

870
01:52:45,600 --> 01:52:47,800
The peaceful family
that don't understand violence

871
01:52:48,240 --> 01:52:50,800
and never harmed a person

872
01:52:51,400 --> 01:52:53,080
started preparing
for a hunt.

873
01:52:53,600 --> 01:52:54,920
A man-hunt.

874
01:53:47,800 --> 01:53:51,480
First, Jon Britto who had falsely
accused Purushothaman of bribery

875
01:53:51,560 --> 01:53:53,080
was kidnapped.

876
01:53:56,880 --> 01:54:00,400
Secondly, the lab attender,
Manikantan

877
01:54:00,480 --> 01:54:02,240
who had falsely accused
Annapoorani of sexual harassment.

878
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:13,560
They both confessed
that they were bribed

879
01:54:14,200 --> 01:54:18,080
by auto driver Nagu
and Rajamanickam to lie.

880
01:54:19,680 --> 01:54:22,080
After investigating Nagu

881
01:54:23,120 --> 01:54:25,320
we learned that
him and Murthy together

882
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:28,080
had orchestrated
Nishanth's accident with the auto

883
01:54:28,640 --> 01:54:31,000
and had called Suja from his phone

884
01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:33,680
and had made her
come out of the dance class

885
01:54:34,520 --> 01:54:36,040
and had abducted her.

886
01:54:36,400 --> 01:54:39,920
They raped our child
and threw her in the streets.

887
01:54:42,440 --> 01:54:43,920
Not only our child.

888
01:54:45,080 --> 01:54:47,280
We learnt that
many girls were being kidnapped

889
01:54:48,360 --> 01:54:51,640
by Thirisangu, Inba and Isakkimuthu

890
01:54:52,840 --> 01:54:56,160
and put on peep shows
in which they raped the girls

891
01:54:57,040 --> 01:54:59,920
for those old and withered men.

892
01:55:11,320 --> 01:55:15,400
Suja! Suja!

893
01:55:15,640 --> 01:55:18,760
The family that had been human
until hearing about it

894
01:55:19,600 --> 01:55:21,120
became beasts.

895
01:55:47,560 --> 01:55:50,480
Judas..

896
01:55:50,720 --> 01:55:55,880
Life is not a heaven, JK.
It's a hell..

897
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:57,800
What would you have done?

898
01:55:57,960 --> 01:55:59,360
What would you have done
if it were you?

899
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:05,120
In every man's cage of conscience,
there's a beast prowling about.

900
01:56:05,360 --> 01:56:07,280
This is what happens
when it breaks out.

901
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:10,880
Never do wrong.
Do not hurt others.

902
01:56:11,360 --> 01:56:13,920
God is watching over us.
Practice non-violence.

903
01:56:14,040 --> 01:56:16,920
People who live by these
good acts are being chased

904
01:56:17,320 --> 01:56:20,720
by men with wealth,
power, ruffians

905
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:23,920
political power and police power.

906
01:56:24,720 --> 01:56:28,160
How long can you run?
There's no way to run now.

907
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:32,680
I turned back.
I chase them now.

908
01:56:33,160 --> 01:56:36,240
Run now!
I don't fear death.

909
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:38,440
I died ages ago.

910
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,680
Run as far as you can.
I'll come for you.

911
01:56:42,440 --> 01:56:46,320
If it's possible to commit crimes
with a tiny amount of intelligence

912
01:56:46,520 --> 01:56:50,040
just imagine what a person
with immense knowledge can do.

913
01:56:50,440 --> 01:56:52,600
That's why we hacked them
and put it in the streets.

914
01:57:03,880 --> 01:57:06,480
Your sister, your daughter..

915
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:08,360
If this happens to them..
Won't you..

916
01:57:08,520 --> 01:57:10,080
Won't you do the same thing?

917
01:57:10,360 --> 01:57:11,480
Won't you kill them?

918
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:14,000
Won't you hack
the wrongdoer to pieces?

919
01:57:24,200 --> 01:57:26,200
Judas..

920
01:57:26,760 --> 01:57:30,200
Judas..

921
01:57:31,040 --> 01:57:32,440
Where is the doctor and his wife?

922
01:57:34,360 --> 01:57:38,200
You know, the Judas
in the Bible was a betrayer.

923
01:57:39,040 --> 01:57:42,600
But I am the Judas Iscariot

924
01:57:43,160 --> 01:57:45,600
to those angels to the end.

925
01:57:51,720 --> 01:57:55,600
Judas..

926
01:57:57,240 --> 01:58:01,280
Judas..

927
01:59:09,600 --> 01:59:12,400
He is not saying anything.
- There's nothing more to say.

928
01:59:12,720 --> 01:59:15,080
What?
- Judas has told everything.

929
01:59:16,040 --> 01:59:18,520
Where's he?
- He's dead.

930
01:59:20,720 --> 01:59:23,200
Did you record what he said?
- No.

931
01:59:25,600 --> 01:59:27,720
Was there any doctor with you
while Judas was speaking?

932
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:32,840
I asked you.
Did you have a doctor with you?

933
01:59:33,160 --> 01:59:36,200
No, sir.
- What do you mean?

934
01:59:36,440 --> 01:59:37,640
Being a CBCID officer

935
01:59:37,720 --> 01:59:39,880
don't you know that a doctor
should be present

936
01:59:39,960 --> 01:59:41,320
when a dying declaration is given?

937
01:59:41,400 --> 01:59:44,720
Charu!
This is Kittappa speaking!

938
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:50,040
Hello?
Charu! Darling!

939
01:59:51,680 --> 01:59:54,080
W-Where are you?
- I don't know, Brother.

940
01:59:54,400 --> 01:59:56,760
I don't know where I am.
- Give it here.

941
01:59:57,360 --> 02:00:00,720
JK. Hey, listen to me first.

942
02:00:01,560 --> 02:00:03,600
Ask me what I need
before returning your sister back.

943
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:06,160
I need that boy
with the shaved head.

944
02:00:06,560 --> 02:00:08,080
I need to know
where his family is.

945
02:00:10,480 --> 02:00:13,400
Sir, Charu is alive!
My sister is alive!

946
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:14,600
My sister is alive.
- Who's on the line?

947
02:00:15,320 --> 02:00:17,520
Charu? My sister's alive.

948
02:00:17,840 --> 02:00:19,920
Hello, this is the DSP.
Who's speaking?

949
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:23,960
Darn you!
Who are you to give me orders?

950
02:00:26,400 --> 02:00:29,240
I'll twist your neck.
Are you trying to blackmail me?

951
02:00:29,720 --> 02:00:30,920
I won't give you anyone.

952
02:00:34,400 --> 02:00:38,840
Please, sir.
- Kittappa, trace out this number.

953
02:00:42,400 --> 02:00:43,760
Hello?

954
02:00:47,800 --> 02:00:50,880
Hello?
Hello, this is JK here.

955
02:00:51,600 --> 02:00:55,360
Sir, please. Don't harm my sister.

956
02:00:55,520 --> 02:00:57,600
Please. Sir?

957
02:01:01,320 --> 02:01:06,040
Okay, sir..
Hello?

958
02:01:10,240 --> 02:01:15,320
Sir, I need my sister back.
Please help me.

959
02:01:15,960 --> 02:01:19,120
What? Do you want me
to give the boy to them?

960
02:01:21,440 --> 02:01:26,080
Sir, I have been searching
for my sister everywhere.

961
02:01:27,240 --> 02:01:28,560
I need my sister back.

962
02:01:29,360 --> 02:01:31,720
I'll take the boy
and bring him back safely.

963
02:01:34,200 --> 02:01:36,080
P-Please consider my request.

964
02:01:36,640 --> 02:01:39,960
Only our department knows
that the boy is here.

965
02:01:40,560 --> 02:01:41,840
Will you shut your mouth?

966
02:01:42,960 --> 02:01:44,040
No, I meant..
- You are a police officer.

967
02:01:44,800 --> 02:01:46,720
Don't bend the law
for your personal interests.

968
02:01:57,760 --> 02:02:01,640
Sir, I don't see anything else.
I see only my sister.

969
02:02:04,560 --> 02:02:06,760
You can go.
No more bull shitting!.

970
02:02:08,240 --> 02:02:10,960
Kittappa, guard the boy.
- Okay, sir.

971
02:02:11,040 --> 02:02:13,080
We have to hand him over
to the IG tomorrow. - Yes, sir.

972
02:02:13,160 --> 02:02:14,600
Sir?
- You can go.

973
02:02:15,560 --> 02:02:17,080
I said, you can go!

974
02:02:20,040 --> 02:02:21,640
Trace out that number soon.

975
02:03:23,120 --> 02:03:25,680
Sir, here's your mobile phone.

976
02:03:31,120 --> 02:03:32,480
Sorry, sir.

977
02:04:01,800 --> 02:04:02,960
Did the boy eat anything?

978
02:04:03,120 --> 02:04:05,680
I asked him all night.
But he never said anything.

979
02:04:23,320 --> 02:04:24,800
It's the DSP.

980
02:04:29,480 --> 02:04:32,440
Hello?
Yes, it's me, JK.

981
02:04:34,280 --> 02:04:39,080
Yes. No, I don't know
where his parents are.

982
02:04:39,520 --> 02:04:40,800
He hasn't answered anything.

983
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:49,480
My parents
are at Palaniappa Mills.

984
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,160
Hello?
My sister is coming along, right?

985
02:04:55,840 --> 02:04:57,800
Where?
- Palaniappa Mills, Ennore.

986
02:04:57,880 --> 02:04:59,440
I'll bury the whole family today.

987
02:05:01,240 --> 02:05:02,120
I already have a gun.

988
02:05:02,200 --> 02:05:04,360
That is an official one.
Use this instead.

989
02:11:32,960 --> 02:11:34,360
Mother!

990
02:11:41,360 --> 02:11:43,920
Hey, where are your parents?

991
02:11:45,120 --> 02:11:47,880
Hey, Inba!
Don't let him go..

992
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:49,400
I'll kill him myself.

993
02:11:49,480 --> 02:11:51,240
Hold him tight.
Don't let him go..

994
02:11:51,800 --> 02:11:55,200
Hey, how dare you throw mud
on my face! I'll kill you now.

995
02:11:55,360 --> 02:11:59,480
I'll kill you now.
- Hey, Isakkimuthu!

996
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:04,080
Where are you?
- Duraipandi, what happened?

997
02:12:04,280 --> 02:12:06,080
What happened to your eyes?
- What's happening here?

998
02:12:06,240 --> 02:12:08,440
Who did this to you?
- I can't see anything. - Hey!

999
02:12:08,600 --> 02:12:13,120
Tell me..
- Save me.

1000
02:12:16,240 --> 02:12:17,960
Father!
- Old rascal!

1001
02:12:18,040 --> 02:12:19,440
Father!
- Will you stab me?

1002
02:12:19,560 --> 02:12:22,760
I'll kill you.
I'll bury you today.

1003
02:12:23,080 --> 02:12:24,720
I'll bury you!
Where's your wife?

1004
02:12:24,840 --> 02:12:25,720
Where..

1005
02:12:49,400 --> 02:12:50,960
Mother!

1006
02:13:07,480 --> 02:13:09,400
Mother!

1007
02:13:12,440 --> 02:13:15,480
Mother!

1008
02:13:16,560 --> 02:13:19,840
Mother!

1009
02:14:07,240 --> 02:14:08,240
Charu!

1010
02:14:09,480 --> 02:14:11,840
JK, come!
Do you want your sister?

1011
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,640
Drop your guns
and kneel before me. Come on!

1012
02:14:16,520 --> 02:14:17,720
Drop them.

1013
02:14:17,840 --> 02:14:19,520

Hello, Mister.
Thanks for the book.

1041
02:17:52,800 --> 02:17:56,400
Nishanth, you have suffered a lot
in your young age.

1042
02:17:57,560 --> 02:17:59,080
Man's life is full of sufferings.

1043
02:18:00,480 --> 02:18:02,560
Even though it was known
that Judas's daughter would die

1044
02:18:03,720 --> 02:18:05,960
your father kept her alive
for four years.

1045
02:18:07,520 --> 02:18:11,440
Ask yourself why
your father did it.

1046
02:18:12,480 --> 02:18:13,680
You will find the answer.

1047
02:18:15,840 --> 02:18:18,720
I don't know what else
to say.

1048
02:18:21,080 --> 02:18:24,760
Good luck.
- Thank you, Mister. Bye.
