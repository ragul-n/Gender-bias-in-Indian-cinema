It can only reduce her pain

14
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,250
Not save her!

15
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,750
Do not cry, sister

16
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,090
Where is mother, Sai anna?

17
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,840
She went out for a breath of fresh air

18
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,840
She is in the garden

19
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,920
Mother...?

Is it you?

23
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,920
What are you doing here?

24
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,090
I asked you to
be with your father

25
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,840
Father asked me to be with you

26
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,460
That is why I came here

27
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,090
Alright

28
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,420
Come, sit

29
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,130
My dearest!

30
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,880
My vision is getting blurred

31
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,380
For my eyes to close gradually

32
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,420
I am preparing for it
once and for all

33
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,540
Nothing will happen to you

34
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:35,790

Mother, you will be fine

38
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,840
You asked for father's photos
Here is the album, amma

39
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,380
Where is he?

40
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,670
Here...

41
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:15,420
My husband resembles God!

42
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,250
Until I see him once more

You can record your voice for HMV

48
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,540
Rama Rao sir, I came
earlier than you today

49
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,630
Great! I have come on time

50
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,630
If women are employed
in jobs they are unfamiliar with

51
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,590
...then this is how it will be!

52
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,920
Mr Edukondalu

53
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:40,920
Why does it bother you
if ladies earn?

54
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,040
Remember for 9 months
with pain and discomfort

55
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,670
...a woman delivers a boy

56
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,590
Women may also rule
our country in the future

57
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,750
True, Rama Rao

58
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:53,630
Until recently we were ruled
by Queen Elizabeth, right?

59
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,670
- Namaste, registrar sir
- Namaste

60
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,170
Here is your file, lord

61
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,750
Clerk, sir

62
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:01,500
No one is lord here

63
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,880
Not just me

64
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,840
Do not address
anyone here like that

65
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,250
I have no objection
if you call me by my name

66
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,500
Hello, sir

67
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,130
Are you not Chenna Kesavalu?

68
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:16,500
'Yes, sir'

69
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,500
I have already signed your papers

70
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,840
Why have you come back again?

71
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,880
They asked for 2 papers

72
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,540
I could not find them, sir

73
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,210
The papers were all intact

74
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,670
What did they want?

75
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:32,630
We bribed those working for you
for 2 annas and came to meet you

76
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,710
We must bribe your superiors
Rs 2 each to obtain a signature

77
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,840
We are poor farmers
in need of a fair share

78
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,590
How can we afford, sir?

79
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,130
Give me the papers

80
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,590
Here, sir

81
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,170
Take a look

82
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,710
These papers are in order, right?
What is missing?

83
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,840
- Rama Rao sir
- Sign the papers

84
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,710
- Rama Rao sir
- SIGN THESE PAPERS NOW!

85
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,170
- Clerk...?
- Sir

86
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,380
- Take this and get it stamped
- Yes, sir

87
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,090
- Where did this money come from?
- This is not yours

88
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,750
Your sub-registrar chair has earned it

89
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,790
'You will get your share'

90
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,840
'Sesame sized sin; shared within'

91
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,630
Share it fair and square

92
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:47,380
- I will speak to him, you go
- He is furious

93
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,420
If we fulfill a task
that is not our duty

94
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,500
...we call it 'bribe'

95
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,500
If we take money to do our duty
then what is that called?

96
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,880
Rama Rao, you have
joined work recently

97
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,840
You must learn
to turn a blind eye

98
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,630
3 months ago
our nation obtained freedom

99
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,880
Even corruption got liberated!

100
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,250
I can see from the way
this office functions

101
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:11,710
Take this

102
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,500
- What is it?
- My resignation letter

103
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,590
Accept it

104
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:18,670
Rama Rao, out of 7000 applicants for
Madras Public Service Commission exam...

105
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,790
...you are 1 among 6
who got the job

106
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,880
1000s of people want
this kind of fortune

107
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,000
Do not kick it away

108
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,090
Rama Rao...!

109
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:30,090
I do not want that luck which supports
my family with others' misfortune

110
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,040
I can try changing human beings

111
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,420
But how can I change the system?

112
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,250
That is why I resigned

113
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,380
Let me take leave

114
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,710
You worked for 3 weeks

115
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,880
If you work for 1 more week
you can get your 1st month's salary

116
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,630
The breadwinner will be
the self proclaimed head of the house

117
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,210
If he ends up accepting bribes

118
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,630
...think about the countless
heads for the same house!

119
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,590
Lakshmi, keep an eye on
the sweet pudding on the stove?

120
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,710
Yes, sister

121
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,750
Today is your wedding anniversary, right?

122
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:30,460
My brother-in-law could have
taken the day off?

123
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,630
Very true

124
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:35,960
Both husband and wife could have bathed
in river Krishna and gone to the temple

125
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:41,170
I am sure you know your son will
never take off even for 1 day, right?

126
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,590
Talk of my angel!
He is back home

127
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,170
As if he will come of his own accord?

128
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:54,790
His boss must have packed him off early
knowing it is a special day!

129
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,880
Your father-in-law has sent you
a message from Komaravolu

130
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,710
Look who has come

131
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,090
He is now a registrar
So wondered if he can take off

132
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:05,790
- Nursed the baby?
- Can you go?

133
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:08,590
I have made your favorite
sweet pudding, dear

134
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,920
Let me bring it for you

135
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,380
I quit my job!

136
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:16,420
Why?

137
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,590
I did not like it

138
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,670
What do you intend doing then?

139
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:30,750
- What happened?
- I believe brother-in-law has quit his job

140
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:37,340
Director L. V.Prasad
recently wrote this letter

141
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,750
I am joining the cine field

142
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,840
Whaaat...?

143
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,460
Acting in a cinema?

144
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,840
Cine field, huh?

145
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,040
Quitting a well-paid job
and entering into cinema?

146
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,790
'Has this ever happened in our house?'

147
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,170
You objected to him becoming a pilot
Now you are against cinema

148
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:00,380
- Will you not let him follow his wish?
- Whom do we know in that field?

149
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,500
Whom did we know
when he took up this job?

150
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,670
Likewise

151
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,500
If he had accepted Mr Pullaiah's offer
he would have been 'Keelu Gurram' hero

152
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,790
- How will his wife cope?
- You objected because he was a student

153
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,380
Tarakam dear, he will
pay heed to your words

154
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,630
Dissuade him, dear

155
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,040
She will endorse
only her husband's wishes

156
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,540
Are you packing?

157
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,380
Not a very trustworthy field, right?

158
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,590
I know you will not
approve of my interest

159
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:43,710
Will you and I ever have
different interests, my dear?

160
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,540
God has blessed you
with an alluring personality

161
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,880
And given you a good education
and a golden heart

162
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:57,170
He has blessed you
with the ability to emote

163
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:01,000
People of Madras love you

164
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,840
Godspeed, my dear

165
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,210
Tarakam

166
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,590
What is this?

167
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,210
It is an unfamiliar city

168
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,130
If necessity demands, sell this

169
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,960
Tarakam

170
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,880
If you refuse
swear on me

171
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:39,670
- Do you really want to get into films?
- Yes, sir

172
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,210
Do you want to become
like hero Nageswara Rao?

173
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,500
No, sir

174
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,210
I want to become 'Rama Rao'!

175
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:59,790
"To Telugu people his name spells glory
He is a beacon of light shining brightly"

176
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:09,540
"To Telugu people his name brings fame
He is a beacon of light; an eternal flame"

177
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:13,250
"Star hero with 300 plus films to his name"

178
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:20,750
"His 'victory march' added to his fame
A star hero he became; won acclaim"

179
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:35,750
"To Telugu people his name brings fame
He is a beacon of light; an eternal flame"

180
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:39,460
"A legend with 300 plus films to his name"

181

Stop...stop
What do you want?

199
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,750
Is this Mr L.V.Prasad's residence?

200
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,590
So what?
Go...go

201
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,880
Hey, let me go in

202
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,840
Coming from Bezawada
He has called me

203
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,960
No, go now

204
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Hey, do you know who I am?

205
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,420
Rama Rao...!

206
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,250
When did you come?

207
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,840
Greetings, Prasad sir

208
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,000
You told me to come to Madras, right?

209
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,170
I am here now

210
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:28,630
I checked into a lodge
and came straight to meet you

211
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,170
I told you to come long ago

212
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,840
And you have come now?

213
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,840
You should have come
when Lady Luck called you

214
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,880
When you choose to come
Lady Luck will not be waiting

215
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,040
I am not pinning my hopes on luck

216
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:43,500
But on me!

217
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,130
Give me a chance to work hard

218
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,540
I will ensure Lady Luck favors me!

219
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,090
Well said!

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,460

auditioning for new faces

00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,920

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,590
Trust me

224
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,250
I belong to you

225
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,840
One among you

226
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,210
I will give my life for you

227
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,090
By the time you give
your life, I will die!

00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,590
- Yoganand
- Sir

229
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:19,210
- Ask him to leave
- You leave...next

230
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,250
Srinivasa Rao, please come in

231
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,130
Have faith in me
I belong to you

232
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,920
- I belong to you
- One among you

233
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,210
Sorry, sir, do you
want me to repeat it?

234
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,250
You sound like 'do you
want me to murder it again?'

235
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,210
- Next
- Come in

236
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,710
Kesava Reddy

237
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,840
- Yoga
- Sir

238
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,750
Do you know how a hero should look?

239
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,170
Nose as a captivating feature

240
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:45,840
...should be prominent

241
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,170
Eyes should have a magnetic appeal

242
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,000
When he smiles, it should
be like the moon shining

243
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,670
On the silver screen...

244
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,590
...he should look like
a Ravi Varma painting

245
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:57,630
Subba Rao

246
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:00,670
He is Rama Rao from Bezawada

247
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,420
'He has quit his job
as sub-registrar'

248
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,960
'If you audition him...'

249
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,540

250
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,750

Cinema is 'Palletoori Pilla'
Your name is Jayanth

252
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,750
Yoganand, give him the script

253
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:20,040
Subba Rao, you have chosen him
without any audition?

254
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:21,630
You said it, Mr Prasad

255
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:24,000
When I was looking
for an artiste for a hero

256
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,210
...you brought a hero in person to me!

257
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,880
Let me also take that audition

258
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,710
I saw your drama
in Bezawada

259
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,840
I am organizing a photo shoot for my hero

260
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,960
Come here

261
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,210
Yoga, give him the agreement

262
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,380
Rama Rao, I am saying it again

263
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,250

00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,750

265
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,880
I will never forget your help

266
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,460
Rama Rao

267
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,880
I am introducing you
into the world of cinema

268
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,040
But I am the one
who introduced him to you!

269
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,670
Rama Rao, do this for me

270
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,590
Do this small role
in my film 'Mana Desam'

271
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,590
- You will get used to the camera
- Correct, Mr Prasad

272
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:21,130
Jayanth, go ahead and do it
You will become camera friendly

273
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:22,380
Alright

274
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,170
Started my career as a constable

275
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,340
And if I have come to this position

276
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,210
...how many places
I would have seen

277
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,840
How many people I would have met!

278
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,750
Otherwise could I have
come to this position?

279
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,710
Allow us to do our job

280
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,840
Cut it, okay

281
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,130
Print

282
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,210
Well done, Rama Rao

283
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,880
Focus on your duty

284
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:54,500
Very good
You did well

285
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,000
If your future is good...

286
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,000
...this will be
a dialog written by God!

287
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,840
Mr Prasad, you got hold
of a very talented man

288
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,210
Mr Nagaiah, pack up
for the day for you

289
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,420
Thank you

290
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,670
Your shot now

291
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,880
People will be shouting slogans loudly

292
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,670
You will lathi-charge them

293
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:17,920
Alright

294
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,170
- Rama Rao
- Sir

295
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:23,920
- It should be natural and realistic
- Sure

296
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,000
- Ready?
- Yes

297
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,040
Okay

298
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:27,250
Sound

299
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:28,790
Roll camera

300
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:31,130
'Rolling, sir'

301
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,170
Action

302
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:34,840
Praise be to independent India

303
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,920
Charge

304
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,880
Why are all of you still standing here?

305
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,840
Can you not understand
when I say 'go'?

306
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,920
Leave now

307
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,630
'Clear out of this place'

308
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:45,880
Did you not hear me?

309
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,460
- Clear out
- Rama Rao

310
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,040
Rama Rao...Rama Rao

311
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:50,250
Go away!

312
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,420
Cut it!

313
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:56,420
Prakash Rao, go and stop him

314
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,880
Rama Rao, stop

315
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,210
Go away!

316
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,630
Rama Rao, cut

317
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,340
He said 'cut'

318
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,630
Cut...?

319
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:05,960
I heard it as 'hit'!

320
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:08,840
You got into your role!
Their backs are so sore

321
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,750
Brother, if you act
in a murder scene...

322
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,790
...you may really kill that actor!

323
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,000
Please forgive me

324
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:17,840
It was not deliberate on my part

325
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,590
You asked me to be
natural and realistic-

326
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:23,170
Does it mean you can hit them so hard?

327
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:36,960
I am witnessing for the 1st time
true emotions required for cinema

328
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,170
You will carve a niche for yourself

329
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:49,210
Sir, Mr L.V.Prasad has sent him

330
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,710
Namaste, sir

331
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,210
I am Rama Rao

332
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:55,790
Mr Prasad asked me
to meet you at 7:00 a.m

333
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,210
You are very punctual

334
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:05,790
- Heard you got your Bachelor's degree
- Yes, sir

335
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,920
Handsome!

336
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:14,040
If you ask people which heroine
is beautiful, answer will be Kanchanamala

337
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:17,040
Tomorrow if you ask people
who is the most handsome hero...

338
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,420
...they will tell your name!

339
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,670
I am saying it today
Mark my words!

340
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,590
Today I am a little busy

341
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:25,840
- Meet me tomorrow, same time
- Sure, sir

342
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,750
Rama Rao

343
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,960
How about wearing
a fur cap like me?

344
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,090
It will suit you

345
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,290
- Meeting with Mr H.M.Reddy?
- Yes

346
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,380
Used up my meal tickets

347
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,960
- If you can get me 1 coupon
- For me also

348
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,290
Of course

349
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,880
I am keeping it here
Take it later

350
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:49,380
All the best, brother

351
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,250
Good morning, sir

352
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,040
Oh! You are here

353
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,710
Very punctual
I am impressed

354
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,590
You value time indeed

355
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:05,250
By the way
where do you stay?

356
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,750
Thousand Lights

357
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,420
Will it be around 5 miles from here?

358
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:11,380
- 7 miles, sir
- Then

359
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:13,420
Do you have a motor cycle?

360
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,460
No, sir, I came by walk

361
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,420
Learn this dialog

362
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,090
Rehearse it well

363
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:31,790
On Thursday at 7:00 a.m

364
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:34,960
Come at 6:00 a.m
I will let you know

365
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,210
I will take leave, sir

366
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,170
"You are in my heart one and only"

367
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:40,340
This life which will merge with the soil

368
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,880
Can it not be sacrificed for that land?

369
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,130
This life which will merge with the soil

370
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:47,040
Can it not be sacrificed for that land?

371
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:48,290
Brother

372
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,380
This life which will merge with the soil

373
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,210
Can it not be sacrificed for that land?

374
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,460
How is it?

375
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,710
Amazing!

376
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:58,630
Hero, this is the song
in your film 'Palletoori Pilla'

377
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:01,590
Master Adinarayana Rao has
composed the tune yesterday

378
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,590
This life which will merge with the soil

379
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,460
Can it not be sacrificed for that land?

380
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,960
[rehearsing the dialog]

381
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,750
Brother, if you had continued,
I would be half moustached!

382
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:16,250
[rehearsing the dialog]

383
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,750
How is it, brother?

384
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:21,250
You have repeated this 112 times!

385
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:24,880
Exclaiming 'fantastic' will
no longer be fantastic, brother

386
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,460
Look at that poor soul

387
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,630
This life which will merge with the soil

388
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,210
Can it not be sacrificed for that land?

389
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:37,090
He has forgotten his lyrics and
singing your dialog like a lunatic!

390
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:39,130
This life which will merge with the soil

391
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,750
Can it not be sacrificed for that land?

392
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,040
This life which will merge with the soil

393
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:46,130
Can it not be sacrificed for that land?

394
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,750
Rama Rao

395
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,590
If you ask, not just my life
I will bequeath you anything!

396
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:53,210
Your performance is outstanding

397
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,460
Listen, you are a great actor

398
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,130
- Keep it up
- Thank you, sir

399
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:59,340
Does it mean I got the hero role?

400
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,090
Why will you not get roles?

401
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:03,540
They will queue up
in front of your porch!

402
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,710
So...

403
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,000
...tomorrow Thursday

404
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,590
Can you come at 6:00 a.m?

405
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:12,500
- Yes, sir
- Good

406
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:15,630
Nageswara Rao and another
new face by name Rama Rao

407
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:17,090
The script is brilliant

408
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:19,090
2 heroes

409
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:20,960
It will be mind boggling

410
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,750
For every 1 rupee you invest
you will get Rs 10, I guarantee

411
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,670
That is alright, Subba Rao
1st let me listen to the story

412
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:29,000
Sir, hero has come

413
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:32,090
- Nageswara Rao or Rama Rao?
- Rama Rao sir

414
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,040
Tell him I am not here

415
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:37,460
I sent him back twice before
with this same reply

416
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,630
Someday I will produce a film

417
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,290
Tell him to wait until then

418
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,290
Go...go and tell him

419
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:45,920
Like I was saying-

420
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,130
Are you not Rama Rao?

421
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:53,460
In Bezawada I have seen you
in many dramas by National Art Theatre

422
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,590
Remember my name
I am Peketi Sivaram

423
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:56,750
Hey Yoganand

424
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:59,290
Rama Rao, director has not come as yet

425
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:01,960
When he comes out...

426
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,880
...tell him word by word
'I came to meet him'

427
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:07,040
Rama Rao

428
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:10,170
- Ask him to come after a couple of days
- Alright, sir

429
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:11,710
Good morning, sir

430
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:16,380
If you had to be here so early

431
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,210
...you should wake up
at least by 4:00 a.m, right?

432
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,040
I am not producing any cinema now

433
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,500
I am short of funds

434
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,090
I am older than you

435
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:34,380
To break this news to you...

436
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,710
...my self-respect came in between!

437
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:41,130
I was hoping one day or the other
you will come late

438
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:44,290
I thought I will use it
as an excuse and send you away

439
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:48,460
But even clocks will be
scared of your discipline!

440
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,590
I never thought of this possibility!

441
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,630
Let bygones be bygones

442
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:55,000
Kindly do not mistake me

443
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,750
Respected sir

444
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:59,750
If you specify a time
should I not be punctual?

445
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,590
How can you assume
I will not be?

446
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:04,590
I will take leave now

447
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:07,960
Please excuse me

448
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:09,750
I will not come back again

449
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,710
Poor chap, sir
He is leaving

450
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,960
I thought he will survive in cinema

451
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:17,290
You are sure he will survive in cinema!

452
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,750
He will make sure cinema survives!

453
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:21,380
Mark my words

454
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,380
Brother

455
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,090
May be you are being impulsive

456
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:31,170
Can you think about it once more?

457
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:33,130
There is nothing more to think

458
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,500
I am a perfectionist

459
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:37,000
I expect everyone
to be the same way

460
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:39,250
Give this letter
to Mr Subba Rao, brother

461
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,840
Rama Rao...Rama Rao

462
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:47,960
You are angry with Mr H.M.Reddy
Why show it on Mr B.A.Subba Rao?

463
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,210
How was he any better?

464
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:50,960
He said he will direct in 2 months

465
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,380
8 months have sped by

466
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,420
I must think of my family too, right?

467
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:57,290
Prakash Rao, hand over
that letter to Mr Subba Rao

468
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:02,040
I never thought you will
also leave us, brother

469
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,590
Stepping back is not in my blood

470
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:07,340
To keep my foot forward
I do not like this route

471
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:21,380
[vendors hawking]

472
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,880
Come, dear

473
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,210
Sit here

474
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,040
Please be seated

475
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:31,250
Tea...coffee...

476
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,420
Do you want coffee?

477
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,630
Thank you

478
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:36,500
- Where are you going?
- Bezawada

479
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,540
Sir, come fast
Train is leaving

480
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:56,670
Oh God!
The train has left

481
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,460
He has gone

482
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,250
We missed him!

483
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,090
- It was not meant to be
- For us, sir?

484
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:12,420
Yoganand, when my cinema got delayed

485
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,460
...even you thought less of me!

486
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,790
I was referring to him

487
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,210
Whether it is self respect...

488
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,290
...or arrogance, I am not sure

489
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:24,540
Sir...!

490
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,290
Come, tonga is ready

491
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,670
How can you make her travel
in this delicate condition?

492
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:32,340
Take her to the nearest hospital

493
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,380
Brother

494
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:40,460
You got down because of us

495
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,460
I do not know
the reason for your travel

496
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,790
It is alright, sister
I will take the night train

497
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,000
You take care

498
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,130
Where to?

499
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:48,670
Where are you going?

500
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,460
I sent you a letter
clearly stating I will not come

501
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,340
Yes, you wrote that silly letter!

502
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,880
You are my hero

503
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,540
You have signed an agreement too

504
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,630
Do not forget that

505
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,540
I do not like the procedures here, sir

506
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:03,710
Wait

507
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,040
Only your honesty will
take you places here

508
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:08,130
Look

509
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,290
To watch all your films

510
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:13,040
...that yet-to-be born baby
has stopped you for us

511
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,040
You will be
a renowned hero!

512
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:18,460
Listen, the funds are ready

513
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:20,420
Let us start shooting

514
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,960
Come along now

515
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:24,960
Jayanth

516
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,750
You are fighting a bull

517
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,920
You are trying to flex its horn

518
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,790
Where is the bull?

519
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,340
This is the bull!

520
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,090
Lift a little more

521
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,960
These are its horns

522
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,960
'Ready'

523
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,840
Roll camera

524
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:42,630
Rolling, sir

525
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:43,840
Action

526
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:48,130
Action

527
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:49,790
Rama Rao...Rama Rao

528
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:51,460
Camera is rolling

529
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,420
Rama Rao, action
Tame the bull

530
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,040
How can I fight without a bull?

531
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:56,340
Cut it...cut

532
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,540
Rama Rao, you do not
have to really fight a bull

533
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:01,040
We have a dupe to do that

534
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:02,750
You fight in a close up shot, enough

535
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:04,290
Dupe...?
Who is that?

536
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,040
He is the one

537
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:10,880
That is cheating

538
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,960
Is this how they shoot
wars in cinema?

539
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,340
Then will they fight really?

540
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,750
If you shoot like this
you are cheating the public

541
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:19,340
I will really fight with
the bull, bring it here

542
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,880
- Bring what?
- The bull!

543
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,210
You want to fight?

544
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,380
Are you taking a dig?

545
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,670
Brother, did you see it
prancing wildly?

546
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:26,920
It will trample you

547
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,040
I am the son of a farmer

548
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:30,710
If I get scared of a bull,
how can I become a hero?

549
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:33,130
Bring it here
I am ready

550
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:36,170
Rama Rao, you are so stubborn

551
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,750
Why will you not listen to us?

552
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,130
Alright, get the bull here

553
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:43,090
Bulli Reddy, bring the bull here

554
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:44,500
Action!

555
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,670
Cut...cut

556
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:30,420
I was the only young hero
in this industry until now

557
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:33,840
I thought I had no competition
Now I have to revise my opinion

558
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,090
In this cinema
you are not the only hero

559
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:37,380
I am there too

560
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,000
People call me Nageswara Rao

561
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,170
How will I not know you?

562
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:42,880
My younger brother and I
watched your 'Balaraju' thrice

563
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,040
Very good!

564
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:47,340
- Where are you from?
- Nimmakuru near Gudivada

565
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,540
Really...?

566
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,880
It is my hometown too

567
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,290
Other side of Gudivadi

568
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,210
Venkataraghava Puram

569
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:55,540
Your arm seems to be broken

570
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Director sir

571
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,040
At least you could have been cautious

572
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:02,170
Whaaaat?

573
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:05,840
If he jumps on that animal
I should have been more cautious?

574
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,210
I was yelling 'cut...cut', Nageswara Rao

575
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:11,210
He heard 'cut' as 'hit' it seems

576
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:13,920
He hit everyone in the film 'Mana Desam'

577
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,630
Shall we go back to work?

578
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:18,210
1st we will take you
to the hospital, brother

579
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:23,670
'Bless the hand that feeds!'

580
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,500
Thanks to your meals ticket
we survived today

581
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:29,250
Betel leaves from Chettiyar

582
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:30,540
Not now, brother

583
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,000
I have an upset stomach

584
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,340
Have you not eaten yet?

585
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,250
'Brother...brother?'

586
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:37,670
My younger brother

587
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:39,960
'Rama Rao, someone has
come looking for you'

588
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,540
- Brother...?!
- Brother, what is this cast?

589
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:47,420
- What happened?
- During the shoot

590
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,840
When he jumped on the bull...

591
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,920
...it tossed him

592
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,210
- Where is it now?
- What? Bull?

593
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,090
Like older brother like younger brother

594
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:56,960
'Sunnundalu' and 'Kajjikayalu'

595
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,040
Savoury and snacks

596
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:02,000
That foldable cot
which all 3 of us fight for

597
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,750
...is all yours
till your stay here

598
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,460
I will thrash you if you eat

599
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:07,170
All that is only for my brother

600
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,090
How is everyone at home?

601
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,290
If you are doing well,
they will be good

602
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:14,340
If they hear about this injury,
how will they be?

603
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,880
Here, a letter from your dear wife

604
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:19,960
Freshen up

605
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,460
We will go out to eat

606
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:25,210
'My dear husband'

607
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:26,880
'Letter from Rama Tarakam'

608
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:29,500
'I hope you have
nothing lacking over there'

609
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:32,000
'For your dreams to come true'

610
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:35,590
'...I pray to river Krishna
and Goddess Durga daily'

611
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,750
'Do not worry about us'

612
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,590
'Our son Ramakrishna
was not keeping well yesterday'

613
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:42,500
'So I took him to the doctor'

614
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,920
'He has prescribed medicine
to be given thrice a day'

615
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,590
'He has been crying now'

616
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:51,880
'Our next door lady is very keen
to know when you will return'

617
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,290
'I have no idea why'

618
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,840
'I intend scolding her
one of these days'

619
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:58,540
'Please take me
to your cinema soon, dear'

620
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,750
'I feel like watching
a film with you'

621
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,420
'Take care of your health'

622
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:04,380
'Your loving wife
Ramatarakam'

623
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,670
Brother...brother
What happened?

624
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,710
- Brother
- Nothing

625
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,670
I just had a slight dizzy spell

626
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,090
You go and shower

627
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:17,090
For how many days?

628
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:18,670
What...?

629
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:19,710
Starving

630
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:23,710
If you deny it
swear on me

631
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:26,210
If I do not eat for 4 days,
is it the end of the world?

632
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,250
Our Subba Rao has not
got financial aid

633
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:29,590
He will pay when he gets

634
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,840
Until then?

635
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,840
Get up
Let us go

636
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,880
You cannot stay here
a moment longer

637
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,040
Where to?

638
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:38,710
Without knowing anything
for sure, no point leaving

639
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,420
Farmer's son and a registrar

640
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,590
You quit everything
for the sake of cinema

641
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:46,380
If you stop eating too
how will you live, brother?

642
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:49,590
If our parents got wind of this
they will feel terrible

643
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,960
Sister-in-law will die!

644
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:54,840
All this is only for them, brother

645
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,210
As soon as my hand heals
we will start the shoot

646
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:58,880
I will not have any other problem

647
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,710
This time I will tame the bull

648
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:03,750
I will not go to Bezawada either

649
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:05,790
I will take care of you
and stay with you

650
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,960
- You have got it wrong
- 'Rama Rao'

651
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,210
What is this?

652
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,880
We thought you gave
your meals ticket to us

653
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,880
We never knew
you were starving instead

654
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,670
Your personality is astonishing, brother

655
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,670
You were responsible
for his starvation

656
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,540
You will fill your stomach and burp

657
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:22,000
Will you not even know
if he ate or not?

658
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:23,790
Brother, these friends gave me shelter

659
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,790
Does it justify them
taking your coupons?

660
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,290
Brother, good deeds will never go waste

661
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:32,840
Not meals ticket, many more tickets
will be sold to watch his film, be patient

662
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,210
'Yes...yes'

663
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:37,340
Brother, you are
amidst shrewd con men

664
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:39,040
Better be careful!

665
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,340
4 cinemas

666
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,250
And a contract for 2 years

667
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:48,380
1st year Rs 500 per month

668
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:50,250
Rs 5000 per cinema

669
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:53,040
2nd year Rs 750 per month

670
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:54,790
Rs 7500 per cinema

671
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:00,290
Until we finish our films
you cannot accept any other offer

672
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,750
Agreed?

673
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,290
If you act in every cinema
without a dupe like this...

674
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,210
...you will have a perennial cast

675
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,710
You have not seen him in action

676
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:13,000
Even in the film 'Manadesam'
you know the backs of all the artistes

677
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:14,920
He beat them black and blue!

678
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:20,000
What are you thinking?

679
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,880
Are you okay with the contract?

680
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,670
I did not want to work
for a monthly salary

681
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:28,040
But I have given in
to this again

682
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,880
Alright

683
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,670
- I am the hero in all the cinemas?
- Of course

684
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,500
You sign the papers

685
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,000
Sign, Rama Rao

686
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,920
Golden opportunity

687
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:46,670
I am signing for a new life

688
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,630
Please bless me, sir

689
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:49,880
Go on, sign

690
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,290
Ready sir

691
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,750
Janaki, are you ready?

692
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,040
[song from 'Shavukaru']

693
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:10,500
"Friendship turned into a love shower
Brimming flowed as a joyous river"

694
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:18,380
"Weaving its waves, joy demonstrated
Victory of good over evil celebrated"

695
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,670
What do you think of the film?

696
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,000
Look there

697
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,960
The film is good
But not the theater

698
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:31,420
It will do well in good theaters

699
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:34,750
'Looks like the collection may be dicey'

700
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:41,040
Brother, this cine field will not suit us

701
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:43,210
Let us go back to our hometown

702
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:44,710
Do not be hasty, Trivikrama

703
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:47,500
This is not the end of the world
He has a bright future

704
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:49,040
What can it be?

705
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:51,340
Right from the beginning
this has been disappointing

706
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:54,170
Safe guarding his self respect
he quit his job as registrar

707
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:56,000
Now he is under the mercy of others

708
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,000
He is always been like this

709
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:00,630
He will go looking for trouble

710
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:02,630
Brother, let us go

711
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,380
We have to tell the people

712
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,960
Cinema is a powerful medium

713
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,960
All they do is sleep in the theaters

714
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,750
You saw only those who were asleep

715
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:13,880
I saw them watch the film
even when they were asleep

716
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,420
Cinema rules the theaters today

717
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,380
Tomorrow it will be
part of their daily life

718
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,500
Our culture will be a vital part of cinema

719
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:25,130
One who does not pay heed to his parents
will listen to his friend, brother

720
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:27,250
There is no better friend than cinema

721
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:30,960
'Goddess, I have a humble request'

722
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:34,590
Those who watched this story
and by word of mouth

723
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:38,840
May they be granted goodness of health
and all kinds of assets and wealth

724
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,840
As soon as Anji prays to Pathala Bhairavi
the Goddess says, 'so be it'

725
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,460
The cinema ends on this note

726
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:50,290
I am waiting for your opinion
about these dialogs, Mr Nagi Reddy

727
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,090
Do you want me to
be honest or lie?

728
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:55,750
Thank you so much

729
00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:00,840
Those who watched this film
and by word of mouth

730
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,840
Interesting!

731
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:10,090
Chakanna, can we book
Nageswara Rao for the hero's role?

732
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:15,540
I feel...Nageswara Rao is a great actor
and a dear friend of mine

733
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:20,040
But as a director I cannot visualise
Nageswara Rao as Thota Ramudu, sir

734
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:22,670
What is this?

735
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,960
Nageswara Rao means fantasy hero, right?

736
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:28,210
- Have you watched 'Keelu Gurram'?
- You are still in 'Keelu Gurram' mind set

737
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:30,210
I have moved on to
'Pathala Bhairavi 'now

738
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:32,460
But Thota Ramudu is different

739
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,960
Girls are wrapping their books
with photos of Nageswara Rao

740
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,250
On the silver screen
1st time an ordinary man

741
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:44,790
...becomes an extraordinary man
That is Thota Ramudu's character

742
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:48,380
If Nageswara Rao cannot fit
we need a big hero for this

743
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,460
This is not a role for a big hero

744
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,290
But a role which can make a big hero

745
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,920
Enough of your opinion!

746
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,750
If you cannot get
a hero for that character

747
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:58,920
...we must change the character
to suit the hero

748
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,210
What do you say, Mr Pingali?

749
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,540
Thota Ramudu's character
will not change, sir

750
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:04,500
His role cannot be compromised

751
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:07,670
Who is it?

752
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:30,840
Rama Rao, huh?

753
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,290
Our Thota Ramudu is Rama Rao

754
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:09,960
I did not have faith
when Reddy was so sure

755
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:12,920
He flutters proudly like a victory flag

756
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,710
Winning horse of
Vijaya Vauhini banner

757
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:20,000
We will redeem our loss in 'Shavukaru'
including interest with this project

758
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,670
'You see that demi-god with the big belly?'

759
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:49,290
'Break his belly
with this steel mace'

760
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,880
'Carry out my order'

761
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,750
Hit hard!

762
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:49,920
How they celebrate a cinema!

763
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:52,090
Clapping and whistling

764
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,250
Just like that Nepali sorcerer
says in the film

765
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:58,460
If we do what the public like

766
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:00,750
...this celebration is
the result, Nagi Reddy!

767
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:02,920
Collection will also multiply, Chakanna

768
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:07,290
Strength of our cinema is proved
by Thota Ramudu's character

769
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:08,790
What do you say, Reddy?

770
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,290
Rama Rao, 1st super star
of Indian screens

771
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:17,210
'Hey! Who is on the screen?'

772
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:18,630
'Rama Rao garu, I say'

773
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:21,380
'Rama Rao sir is here'

774
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:24,750
'Praise be to NTR!'

775
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:28,960
[loud cheering]

776
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:39,960
- Glory to Thota Ramudu!
- Jai Pathala Bhairavi!

777
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:42,540
That is Thota Ramudu over there

778
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:44,340
'Bawa'

779
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:46,710
My dear

780
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:49,500
City of Madras welcomes you

781
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,630
- Your father
- Nana

782
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:52,750
Come to me, son

783
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:56,090
I watched all your films along with amma

784
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:58,960
- Ramakrishna, how are you?
- I am good, father

785
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:00,710
- How are you?
- I am fine

786
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:01,840
Come

787
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:05,540
Look over there, sir

788
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:07,960
'Pathala Bhairavi' hero, Rama Rao

789
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:10,170
Ask him for his autograph

790
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:11,960
Rama Rao sir
Autograph please

791
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,250
Hold him

792
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:19,000
Bawa, you said the cine field
is not trustworthy

793
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:22,380
If my beloved Tarakam sends me off

794
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:25,380
...whatever the field, I will
taste the fruits of success

795
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
- Thank you very much, sir
- 'Vanakkam'

796
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:48,290
4 rooms

797
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:49,500
Verandah

798
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:51,040
And a back yard

799
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,290
Rent is Rs 46

800
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,630
Rs 46?

801
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,880
- Every month?
- Yes, dear

802
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,210
How is the house?

803
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,960
Any house is like its owner's heart

804
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,920
That means how is it?

805
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,500
Spic and span
Spacious

806
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,880
This is our room

807
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:21,960
Beautiful

808
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,880
Waist band?

809
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:29,540
Looks expensive

810
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:32,710
After 'Pathala Bhairavi'
I got an advance for 6 films

811
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:34,130
I bought with that money

812
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,960
You bought this waist band
instead of my coin necklace

813
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:44,960
Coin necklace

814
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:48,090
I gave it to you
to sell in case of emergency

815
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:49,920
This is not jewellery, dear

816
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,090
It is confidence given to me by my wife

817
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:54,630
How can I sell that confidence?

818
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:57,090
Should I not preserve it
for my entire life?

819
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:00,960
After the shoot of
'Pelli chesi choodu'

820
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,960
...I will be free for a month

821
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,170
Shall we relax in Ooty's cool climate?

822
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:06,460
Ooty?

823
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:13,960
"Get married, rent a house happily
Spend the rest of our lives heartily"

824
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:19,290
"With comforts to heart's contentment
you should all lead a life of enjoyment"

825
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:20,590
Cut it

826
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:22,630
Mr Rama Rao

827
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,590
Concentration should be on the song

828
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:28,460
Lip movement and at the same time
on the hand movement

829
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,340
It should be very natural, okay?

830
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:31,960
'Mr Rama Rao'

831
00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:34,750
Have you never played
the harmonium before?

832
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:35,920
No, sir

833
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,040
My wife knows
I used to watch her play

834
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:43,000
Mrs Rama Rao, please come

835
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:44,290
Me?

836
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,960
Please come and teach your husband

837
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:50,960
- Aiyaiyo!
- It is alright, madam

838
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:53,500
Come, Tarakam

839
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:55,960
Tarakam, come

840
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,790
'Mrs Rama Rao, please come'

841
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,590
[song from 'Pelli Chesi Choodu']

842
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:06,250
"Get married, rent a house cheerfully
Spend the rest of our lives blithefully"

843
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:12,340
"With comforts to heart's contentment
you should all lead a life of merriment"

844
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:26,500
Marvellous!

845
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:30,840
This is the marriage
between music and acting!

846
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,840
Rama Rao, did you observe?

847
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,790
Just act like your wife
That will do

848
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,000
Yes

849
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,500
Let us go for take, come on

850
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:39,340
Thank you, guru

851
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:42,290
Watch your disciple play his role now

852
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:49,920
"Get married, rent a house happily
Spend the rest of our lives heartily"

853
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:55,710
"With comforts to heart's contentment
you should all lead a life of enjoyment"

854
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:04,920
Marcus, actually-

855
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:07,540
Mr Rama Rao, would you mind
lending me Rs 200?

856
00:49:07,590 --> 00:49:09,880
Gummadi sir, your expenses
seem to be escalating

857
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,290
In spite of my advice
you continue to smoke

858
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:14,790
I did not ask for this

859
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,920
You know of the draught
in Rayalaseema now?

860
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,790
I want to help a friend in Kurnool
to the best of my ability

861
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:23,380
I heard about it too
Poor people of Rayalaseema

862
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:25,250
At least our Govt should support them?

863
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:26,920
5 years since we attained freedom

864
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,040
What to do, sir?

865
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:29,750
I will help

866
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:32,590
Organize a cultural event
in the entire state for Rayalaseema

867
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:35,090
- And we can collect funds?
- Good idea

868
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:38,960
As far as I know, no film hero has
ever thought so much for the people

869
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,380
- You will be the first
- Not just me

870
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:43,960
We will form a group of like-minded people

871
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:45,290
Only harmonium

872
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:48,540
- Or do you play other instruments?
- I know a bit of violin

873
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:49,630
Tarakam

874
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,750
I mentioned about Ooty, right?

875
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:52,960
That plan is-

876
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:00,090
'Dear one and all
I am your mother'

877
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:01,290
'Your Telugu mother'

878
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:02,880
I have 3 children

879
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:06,840
Andhra, Telengana and Rayalaseema

880
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,670
One child is upset and crying now

881
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:12,000
Hands of the other children
should wipe his tears, right?

882
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:15,710
Mother, we give you our word
not to make you cry

883
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:19,000
We promise to help
the people of Rayalaseema

884
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:23,290
Prakasam, this should not be a drama

885
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:25,590
It must be something
more interesting

886
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:30,130
Mr Vemulapalli Sri Krishna is
part of your troupe I think?

887
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:31,710
Yes, why?

888
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:34,960
Let us sing in praise
of our Telugu land

889
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,630
- Song, huh?
- Fantastic

890
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:39,340
Both the ladies have agreed

891
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:41,090
Rehearse the song

892
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:46,960
"Raise your hand in single-minded unison
Praise in chorus, man of Telugu origin"

893
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:51,130
"Your past name and fame
accompanies you all the same"

894
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:59,960
"This land is known for its sacrifice
of blood and bravery; no compromise"

895
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:05,340
"Palanadu belongs to you
So does Velanadu too"

896
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:09,590
"Palanadu belongs to you
So does Velanadu too"

897
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:13,500
"Revel in the glory of Balachandrudu
the valiant warrior of Palnadu"

898
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:17,750
"Young general Tandra Paparayudu
committed royal suicide for Telugu"

899
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:30,540
"Nayakuralu Nagamma, Molla, Mallamma Devi
exemplary women synonymous with bravery"

900
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:38,170
"Sibling of every Telugu
Manchala, wife of Balachandrudu"

901
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:41,880
"Our Telugu land is the mother
who gave birth to many a brave warrior"

902
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,290
"Land for mothers here
with courage crystal clear"

903
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:48,040
You can collect funds from
your colleagues in the cine field

904
00:51:48,130 --> 00:51:51,880
Who will have the heart to say 'no' to you?
Why are you asking the public?

905
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,880
This mission is not mere charity

906
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,040
But for Dharma and it is people's duty
to lead a responsible life

907
00:51:57,090 --> 00:51:59,920
Reminding people of their duty
is the duty of artistes like us

908
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,880
"Buoyant and bouncy is river Gautami"

909
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:06,750
"River Krishna brims with prosperity"

910
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:12,500
"Buoyant and bouncy is river Gautami
River Krishna brims with prosperity"

911
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:19,920
"Enough if Tungabadra as its tributary
dances overflowing with felicity"

912
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:27,090
"In a nation where granaries flourish
no dearth of clothing or food to relish"

913
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:39,960
"If 30 million Telugu people unite on earth"

914
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:44,540
"Our neighboring lands will know our worth"

915
00:52:44,590 --> 00:52:48,250
"You share the same mother
Telugu land's sister and brother"

916
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:52,960
"Why be hassled at hand
by step children of another land?"

917
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,920
Without discriminating
the young and old, male and female

918
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:57,630
...everyone gave magnanimously

919
00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:59,670
Women were even better

920
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,750
Total collection 100000

921
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,460
I have written the accounts

922
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:07,250
You are the beacon of light
in our industry

923
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:09,170
We request you to donate this amount

924
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:13,500
'...to the Rayalaseema Karuvu sahaya Nidhi'

925
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:18,960
Rama Rao, wait

926
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:24,500
Who asked you to go there?

927
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:26,750
What do you think of yourself now?

928
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:29,460
Do you know how much
we are investing on you?

929
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:33,290
Only to watch you, people buy tickets
and flock to the theaters

930
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:37,000
If you interact with them
who will watch your films?

931
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:40,040
Did it not occur to you
to share your plan?

932
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:44,090
Govt can take care of the people

933
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,960
It is enough if actors
stay behind the screen

934
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:52,920
You are bound by our contract

935
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,590
How will you respond to this?

936
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:56,250
Tell me

937
00:53:57,130 --> 00:53:58,290
What should I tell, sir?

938
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:03,630
I do not need a contract which entails me
to obtain permission even to seek alms

939
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,960
I thought I should act
for the people

940
00:54:07,630 --> 00:54:09,630
If it comes between
my people and me

941
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:11,960
I will say 'no' to cinema also

942
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:16,750
I am indebted to Vijaya Vauhini
for giving me this stardom status

943
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,500
Thank you, I take leave

944
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:39,340
Rama Rao garu, what happened?

945
00:54:39,590 --> 00:54:41,840
Give this collection
to Ramakrishna Mutt

946
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,790
Ensure it reaches
the people in Rayalaseema

947
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:48,960
What happened?
Your brother is upset?

948
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:51,840
He broke Vijaya Vauhini's contract

949
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,090
Is that so?

950
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:55,590
If he does not act in their film
as per their contract

951
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:57,840
...other producers will
hesitate to book him

952
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,090
Milk in Madras is
not thick enough, dear

953
00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:04,790
Can we buy 4 buffaloes?

954
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:07,540
I am fine if you are
back to riding a cycle

955
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:09,630
I gave up only on
Vijaya studio's contract

956
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:10,840
Not victory!

957
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:13,250
Listen, brother

958
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:15,630
Nagi Reddy refused to give you a job, eh?

959
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:17,290
From now on
we will give jobs

960
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:19,000
We will produce films on our own

961
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:22,340
We will convert our drama banner
into a cinema production house

962
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:24,540
Call Pundarikaksham
He will support you

963
00:55:24,590 --> 00:55:25,880
Your wish is my command!

964
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,670
National Art Theatre...NAT

965
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,040
'Rama Rao'

966
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,250
Rama Rao

967
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:36,790
Name of the banner is National Art Theatre

968
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,460
- Sounds great
- Guruji, namaste

969
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:40,960
Namaste, sir

970
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:43,500
Come and eat with us

971
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:47,540
Listen, I will eat only if
your husband gives his word

972
00:55:47,790 --> 00:55:48,840
For what?

973
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:51,460
We are starting a fantasy film
called 'Chandrahaaram'

974
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:54,880
Kamalakar Kameswara Rao
is our debut director

975
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,000
Very good

976
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,670
Convey my best wishes

977
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:02,500
Best wishes it seems
Did you hear that, Prasad?

978
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,090
Rama Rao

979
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:09,340
Your call sheets are the only best wishes
for Telugu cinema now

980
00:56:09,590 --> 00:56:12,500
- Please accept
- I did not walk out in a huff

981
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:13,790
Due to self respect

982
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:17,540
Producer Nagi Reddy vetoed you
Not Nagi Reddy the person

983
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,960
He was the one who sent us here

984
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:23,840
But it is-

985
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,630
Rama Rao, tell me this

986
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:29,040
Is it not as good as Mr Nagi Reddy
being here, if I have come?

987
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:30,960
Accept this advance

988
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:35,920
Will you take it or do you want me
to go on hunger strike here?

989
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,840
Please accept it, Rama Rao

990
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:42,710
If you respect us
accept this token advance

991
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,170
Madam, please persuade him

992
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,210
Tarakam, accept it

993
00:56:52,090 --> 00:56:53,250
Very good

994
00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:56,040
With our best wishes, madam

995
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,630
This is what I like about you

996
00:56:58,670 --> 00:57:01,130
Madam, you offered to serve us lunch

997
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:04,920
If you serve me lunch and also
pack it in a lunch box for me

998
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,960
...I will make Nagi Reddy eat
and convey the good news

999
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:19,540
Bawa, can I buy
buffaloes with that money?

1000
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,840
That amount is for
'Chandrahaaram', dear

1001
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:25,290
Just like the film's title
can I get you a gold necklace?

1002
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:26,790
Why spend on me, dear?

1003
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:30,290
Spend this money on your dream
of making your own film

1004
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:31,710
Tarakam

1005
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:34,340
You never ask me for anything

1006
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:37,000
Are you not there for me, dear?

1007
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:39,670
Only if I need anything
more precious than you

1008
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:40,880
There is nothing, right?

1009
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:45,960
"O' Rama, allow me to be
by Your side to serve You daily"

1010
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:51,040
"O' Rama, give me the pleasure
to be Your loyal, forever-servitor"

1011
00:57:51,090 --> 00:57:57,670
"O' Rama, allow me to be
by Your side to serve You daily"

1012
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:08,670
Stop...stop

1013
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:10,960
Hero will meet all of you, please wait

1014
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,540
- He left from here, right?
- You are a star now

1015
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:15,880
What brings you to
our humble abode, brother?

1016
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,130
You could have sent a dove-

1017
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:19,460
If I am a big star now
will I become a stranger?

1018
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,710
I want to produce cinema
with my younger brother

1019
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:25,630
Very good! 1st film from the banner of
Thota Ramudu is praise worthy!

1020
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:27,920
You will choose
only renowned directors

1021
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,920
Mr K.V.Reddy or Mr L.V.Prasad?

1022
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:33,960
Thatineni Prakasa Rao

1023
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,290
Brother

1024
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:47,630
Accept it

1025
00:58:48,170 --> 00:58:50,460
I told my brother about
your story 'Pichi Pullayi'

1026
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:51,880
He agreed to produce it

1027
00:58:52,210 --> 00:58:53,460
Thank you, brother

1028
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:56,670
Hey Raju, you will be
the music director

1029
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,960
- What about my advance?
- Wait, brother

1030
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:05,040
Hey Yoganand, you will direct
the 2nd film from our banner

1031
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:06,670
Prepare yourself

1032
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:09,710
I am ready with our story, brother

1033
00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:11,000
'Thodu Dhongalu'

1034
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:13,210
Very good

1035
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:16,960
Thotakura Venkat Raju, you will
compose the music for this cinema too

1036
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:19,670
This is for both the projects

1037
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,460
In addition to your brother
you think of your friends' future too

1038
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:27,170
You are really a hero

1039
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:29,750
'Rama Rao sir
Will you come out please?'

1040
00:59:29,790 --> 00:59:31,590
I am coming
Please wait

1041
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:38,880
"Like a hidden shadow
Like your attendant following you"

1042
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:44,040
"Like an unseen shadow
Like a friend following you"

1043
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:49,290
"I would like to pamper you
in all that you want to do"

1044
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:52,590
"O' Rama, allow me to be
by Your side to serve You daily"

1045
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:07,880
'Gireesam sir, is it not a sin
for widows to remarry?'

1046
01:00:09,630 --> 01:00:12,710
'I am so upset by your innocence'

1047
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:17,540
'Parasara Smriti clearly emphasises
widows should opt for remarriage'

1048
01:00:17,590 --> 01:00:20,840
'Scholars in Rajamahendravaram
have written treatises on this'

1049
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,880
'In olden days widows remarried
as a general practice'

1050
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,290
'Venkatesam'

1051
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,340
Cut

1052
01:00:27,630 --> 01:00:28,750
Excellent

1053
01:00:28,790 --> 01:00:30,290
Go and eat

1054
01:00:30,630 --> 01:00:32,250
- Well done, Janaki
- Mr Rama Rao

1055
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:36,090
I thought it is difficult
to understand Gireesam's character

1056
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:38,040
You did a splendid job

1057
01:00:38,590 --> 01:00:41,500
No one was prepared
to accept this role

1058
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:47,540
With your courage, you have settled
my debt of gratitude to writer Gurazada

1059
01:00:47,590 --> 01:00:49,250
Only he who dares tastes success

1060
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:51,090
Am I right, Rama Rao garu?

1061
01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:52,290
Pullaiah sir

1062
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:54,500
'Kanyasulkam' is not just a drama

1063
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:56,500
It is a philosophy in its own right

1064
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:19,130
Sorry, brother
if I hit you too hard

1065
01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:23,960
"Those who think of you all the time
Those who plead to You, deity divine"

1066
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:29,960
"O' Lord, grace us forever
in any avatar you favor"

1067
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:37,250
"Those who think of you all the time
Those who plead to You, deity divine"

1068
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:43,170
"O' Lord, grace us forever
in any avatar you favor"

1069
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:50,710
"Seated in the heart of Your devotee
To be seen by human eyes a rarity"

1070
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:54,290
"Seated in hearts of those devoted to you
To be seen, a rare phenomenon anew"

1071
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:56,170
Onion 'pakoda'

1072
01:01:57,630 --> 01:02:00,090
If this is for me
what about your brother?

1073
01:02:00,130 --> 01:02:02,750
We have to work and
you will munch 'pakodas'?

1074
01:02:02,790 --> 01:02:06,710
"O' Rama, give me the pleasure
to be Your loyal, forever-servitor"

1075
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:08,040
"O' Rama, allow me to be"

1076
01:02:08,090 --> 01:02:09,710
Careful!

1077
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:11,840
- Aiyaiyo!
- Ramakrishna

1078
01:02:15,290 --> 01:02:16,630
Nothing to worry, ma

1079
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:19,090
- Should you not be careful?
- Alright, father

1080
01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:23,670
"O' Rama, allow me to be
by Your side to serve You daily"

1081
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:29,170
This divine image with 4 hands
holding a conch and discuss

1082
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:31,210
...should appear in 'stop block', Marcus

1083
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:34,340
'Reddy garu, I have exhausted
all my techniques'

1084
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:36,090
This is for 'Mayabazar'

1085
01:02:36,130 --> 01:02:38,840
How can N.T.Rama Rao
play Lord Krishna's role?

1086
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,630
He is the perfect choice

1087
01:02:42,130 --> 01:02:44,340
Think about it once more, Mr Reddy

1088
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:47,460
If it is a fantasy film
and Thota Ramudu, agreed

1089
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:50,920
Nagi Reddy feels Rama Rao is too rough
for the role of Lord Krishna

1090
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:55,670
He played Lord Krishna in 'Sontha Ooru'
That film did not run even for 4 days

1091
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:59,920
That was Krishna in a drama in the film
but this is Krishna in a real role

1092
01:03:00,170 --> 01:03:02,710
Reddy, this is a cinema on a huge scale

1093
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,290
If necessary we can call
Mr 'Eelapata' Raguramaiah

1094
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:07,960
Or else we can call CSR

1095
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:11,170
Chakrapani garu, Rama Rao will
be the perfect choice

1096
01:03:11,210 --> 01:03:13,630
He has a spark of mischief in his eyes

1097
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,960
Mavullayya, give me a cigarette

1098
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:59,500
Sambayya, how many coconuts did you bring?

1099
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:00,920
'1116, sir'

1100
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,630
- Total waste
- Sir?

1101
01:04:02,670 --> 01:04:04,170
I said it is a waste
Go ahead

1102
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:05,460
Sir, cigarette

1103
01:04:58,750 --> 01:05:00,090
Lord Krishna

1104
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:36,540
If the producer does not like
how will the public accept him?

1105
01:05:36,590 --> 01:05:37,670
He will come now?

1106
01:05:37,710 --> 01:05:39,000
Not just Rama Rao

1107
01:05:39,090 --> 01:05:40,130
Reject me too

1108
01:05:40,210 --> 01:05:41,500
Sir...!

1109
01:05:58,040 --> 01:05:59,460
'Broad shoulders'

1110
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:01,340
'Clear gaze in his eyes'

1111
01:06:01,790 --> 01:06:03,090
'Remarkable stride'

1112
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:05,840
'Grace and splendor'

1113
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,130
He is blessed with
all these qualities, Mr Reddy

1114
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:18,500
God should never greet

1115
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:29,500
"Glory to our benefactor, Lord Krishna
who rests on the snake 'Adisesha'"

1116
01:06:29,590 --> 01:06:32,290
[song from 'Mayabazar']

1117
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:36,750
"Praise be to the destroyer of evil
Praise be to the protector of His people"

1118
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:43,920
"He embraces his devotees in harmony
Praise be to the ruler of worlds many"

1119
01:06:47,210 --> 01:06:50,840
"Your sublime stories
handed down to us"

1120
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:54,630
"Whether written, watched or heard too"

1121
01:06:54,670 --> 01:06:58,170
"Fortune will forever favor you
Hand in hand with blessings anew"

1122
01:06:58,250 --> 01:07:02,500
"With a peaceful heart and relaxed mind
rewards and recognition you will find"

1123
01:07:12,250 --> 01:07:13,540
Pithambaram

1124
01:07:14,250 --> 01:07:17,250
You have transformed a man
into God with your make-up

1125
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:19,880
Oh no! I am not
worthy of that praise

1126
01:07:20,090 --> 01:07:22,880
He does not look like God
because of my make-up

1127
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:28,710
It was the lord of 7 hills, who sat daily
in front of me and made me apply make up

1128
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,460
Shot okay

1129
01:07:32,130 --> 01:07:33,500
Print

1130
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:35,920
'Praise be to Lord of the 7 hills'

1131
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:38,630
'Glory to You!'

1132
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:41,500
'Praise be to our creator'

1133
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:44,130
'Glory to You, Lord Vishnu'

1134
01:07:44,210 --> 01:07:47,210
'Glory to our one and only savior'

1135
01:07:47,250 --> 01:07:49,880
'Praise be to You'

1136
01:07:50,090 --> 01:07:53,130
Srikalahasti, Tirumala and Tirupati
Ganesha temple at Kanipakam

1137
01:07:53,170 --> 01:07:54,790
'Throvagunta Bus Station'

1138
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:57,130
Come...come in
Get NTR's blessings

1139
01:07:57,170 --> 01:07:59,840
I want to get NTR's blessing
Will this bus take me?

1140
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:02,130
Yes, yes
Get in

1141
01:08:02,170 --> 01:08:04,750
Srikalahasti...Tirupati

1142
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:07,250
'Praise be to Lord of the 7 hills'

1143
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:10,250
'Glory to You!'

1144
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:13,040
'Praise be to our savior'

1145
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:15,170
'Glory to you'

1146
01:08:15,210 --> 01:08:17,460
'Praise be to Lord of the 7 hills'

1147
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:19,880
'Govinda! Govinda!!'

1148
01:08:20,250 --> 01:08:22,090
- Are you all keeping well?
- Yes, sir

1149
01:08:22,130 --> 01:08:24,420
- Did you have enough rain?
- Yes, sir

1150
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:26,380
- What crops did you sow?
- Paddy, sir

1151
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:27,630
Is it remunerative?

1152
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:28,750
'Yes, sir'

1153
01:08:28,790 --> 01:08:30,880
Please save your earnings

1154
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:32,840
Save it up for your children

1155
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,960
- Do not spend lavishly
- 'Okay, swami'

1156
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,630
Our pilgrimage to Tirupati is not complete
without seeing our hero NTR?

1157
01:08:38,710 --> 01:08:40,170
'Bless you, my dear son'

1158
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:43,130
- Namaste, sir
- We take leave

1159
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:46,090
Guruji, Ramayana is narrated by many

1160
01:08:46,710 --> 01:08:49,130
Brother wants to narrate
the story of Ravana

1161
01:08:49,790 --> 01:08:53,040
In my production, we want
this cinema to be directed by you

1162
01:08:53,590 --> 01:08:55,000
Seetha Rama Kalyanam

1163
01:08:59,750 --> 01:09:02,750
Good deeds elevate
even humans as God

1164
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,590
That is the story of Rama

1165
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:08,420
Wrong deeds however alter
even a great person into a demon

1166
01:09:08,630 --> 01:09:10,170
This is the story of Ravana

1167
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:19,460
Rama Rao, I stood my ground you will be
Thota Ramudu in spite of all the resistance

1168
01:09:19,710 --> 01:09:22,630
I proved only you are Lord Krishna
on the silver screen

1169
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:26,540
My heart which saw God in you
cannot see you as a demon

1170
01:09:34,210 --> 01:09:37,880
Brother, can we look
at some other story?

1171
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:41,090
This is a story to be told
It has to be made into a film

1172
01:09:43,540 --> 01:09:45,460
- Mr Ravikant Nagaich
- Sir

1173
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:48,170
What did you think of
the scene I narrated?

1174
01:09:48,210 --> 01:09:49,880
10 heads of Ravana

1175
01:09:50,170 --> 01:09:52,880
...should get established very clearly

1176
01:09:53,170 --> 01:09:55,210
Each head should appear
one after the other

1177
01:09:55,250 --> 01:09:57,960
I think this is the 1st time
on Indian screen

1178
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,880
Sir, I have a couple of ideas

1179
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:04,920
Through trick photography
if we want the desired effect

1180
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:07,960
...it will take 2 hours for each head

1181
01:10:08,710 --> 01:10:12,380
I need 3 cameras and
I must try various masks

1182
01:10:12,670 --> 01:10:16,630
So...you need to
stay still for 20 hours

1183
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:18,880
Without even moving a millimeter

1184
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:21,210
Remain in the same posture

1185
01:10:21,670 --> 01:10:23,880
- Like a stone
- 20 hours?

1186
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:25,170
Without moving?

1187
01:10:27,210 --> 01:10:28,460
It is alright

1188
01:10:28,590 --> 01:10:29,670
I will do it

1189
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:31,460
Brother

1190
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:34,960
Being stubborn, you almost lost
your eye sight in the film 'Chiranjeevulu'

1191
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,880
Do you want to be paralysed now?

1192
01:10:38,130 --> 01:10:40,670
Time to take Telugu cinema
to greater heights, brother

1193
01:10:40,710 --> 01:10:42,540
My dream is a day will dawn

1194
01:10:42,590 --> 01:10:46,210
...when a Telugu cinema poster will be
stuck in at least 1 wall worldwide

1195
01:10:46,250 --> 01:10:48,090
Result can occur anytime

1196
01:10:48,380 --> 01:10:50,590
But effort should begin from us

1197
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:53,170
- Okay, Mr Ravikant, are you ready?
- Ready, sir

1198
01:10:55,630 --> 01:10:57,670
- Sound
- 'Running, sir'

1199
01:10:58,540 --> 01:10:59,790
Roll camera

1200
01:11:00,710 --> 01:11:02,920
- 'Rolling, sir'
- And action!

1201
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:05,790
Mountain!

1202
01:11:11,210 --> 01:11:12,880
'Mountains forward'

1203
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:21,710
NTR sir, slowly hands up

1204
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:42,670
'NTR sir, slowly hands down!'

1205
01:11:46,750 --> 01:11:47,880
Focus

1206
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:04,880
How many hours to be like this?

1207
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,840
- 8 hours
- 8 hours?

1208
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:09,880
No break, one by one
finish lunch and return

1209
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:11,590
Work is continuous

1210
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:17,750
What about my brother?

1211
01:12:18,670 --> 01:12:21,130
Not possible
Next we need mask shots

1212
01:12:35,670 --> 01:12:37,880
- Sir, shall I serve you food?
- No need

1213
01:12:38,250 --> 01:12:40,500
- Will you have coffee?
- No, go away

1214
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:50,420
Lights center...center

1215
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,880
Sir, you have a call from home

1216
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:04,880
- Hello
- This is Rukmangada speaking

1217
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:07,380
Sister has given birth to a boy baby

1218
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:08,840
Is that so?

1219
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:10,750
- How is sister-in-law?
- Sister is fine

1220
01:13:10,790 --> 01:13:12,840
'I need to inform
my brother-in-law'

1221
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:15,040
He is in a shot
I will inform him later

1222
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:16,880
Only I should tell him personally

1223
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:19,960
'10 hours for this shot to be over
I will inform him definitely'

1224
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,750
A single shot for 10 hours?!

1225
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:35,880
- How much more time?
- 7 hours

1226
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,420
1st time on Indian screen, brother

1227
01:13:39,590 --> 01:13:41,210
Please, support

1228
01:14:13,710 --> 01:14:15,170
And...cut it!

1229
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:18,090
NTR sir, excellent, sir...excellent

1230
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:20,710
Oh! You are...you are a genius, sir!

1231
01:14:20,750 --> 01:14:21,920
Brother!

1232
01:14:22,670 --> 01:14:23,670
NTR sir

1233
01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:25,210
What happened, brother?

1234
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:27,000
Brother!

1235
01:14:28,590 --> 01:14:34,000
Rama Rao sir, when you breathed life
into Ravana for the silver screen

1236
01:14:34,130 --> 01:14:37,840
...you have got a befitting son
who shares his birth star 'Moola'

1237
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:41,210
You may think it is merely
a coincidence, but wait and watch

1238
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:44,880
He will be a connoisseur of arts
and as emotive as Ravana

1239
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:49,250
Since Mercury is in his own house
he will not have any demonic attributes

1240
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:52,880
He can differentiate good and bad
and be an asset to your lineage

1241
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:55,000
- He will live upto your name
- 'Moola'

1242
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:56,500
'Kethu' star

1243
01:14:56,540 --> 01:14:58,000
Fervent warrior

1244
01:14:58,750 --> 01:14:59,880
My star is 'Swathi'

1245
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:01,750
Ruled by 'Rahu'

1246
01:15:01,790 --> 01:15:02,880
Lover of peace

1247
01:15:03,210 --> 01:15:05,130
Any war is for peace after all?

1248
01:15:05,590 --> 01:15:08,590
In addition Gemini being his ascendant

1249
01:15:08,630 --> 01:15:09,920
...he will be ever young

1250
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:12,880
Which means our boy
will never grow old

1251
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:14,460
Even after 60 years...

1252
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:17,380
...he will be busy making
all his dreams come true

1253
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:19,210
Did you hear that?

1254
01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:22,130
You need to keep an eye on him

1255
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:24,880
What name do you have in mind?

1256
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:26,590
Come, my darling prince

1257
01:15:30,540 --> 01:15:32,790
Forever young means Lord Krishna, right?

1258
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:35,090
Maybe that's why
he is the 8th child

1259
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:36,630
A child who will never age

1260
01:15:36,670 --> 01:15:38,460
My heir in acting too

1261
01:15:38,710 --> 01:15:40,500
Nandamuri Balakrishnudu

1262
01:15:42,790 --> 01:15:44,170
Like it, Tarakam?

1263
01:15:44,210 --> 01:15:45,880
- Nice name
- Come, dear

1264
01:15:46,590 --> 01:15:48,710
Now let us write your name

1265
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:50,840
Come...hold this ring

1266
01:15:51,210 --> 01:15:53,170
Nandamuri

1267
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:56,960
Bala...Krishna!

1268
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:01,170
Our 'Seetha Rama Kalyanam'
has been cleared by censor

1269
01:16:01,210 --> 01:16:04,000
All the members
gave a standing ovation

1270
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:07,960
They thanked you for raising the bar
of Telugu cinema, brother

1271
01:16:08,420 --> 01:16:10,540
Thanks to the power of
Balakrishna's name

1272
01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:11,880
True, brother

1273
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:16,130
'Praise be to Ravana
The great King of Lanka'

1274
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:31,380
'With intentions cunning
features alluring, you vicious lady'

1275
01:16:31,670 --> 01:16:33,960
'Mesmerizing my forefathers'

1276
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:36,840
'Did you not steal
the pot of ambrosia?'

1277
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:40,170
'Taking the holy cow Kamadhenu
and sacred tree Kalpatharu'

1278
01:16:40,210 --> 01:16:42,840
'...did you not give us a naught?'

1279
01:16:45,170 --> 01:16:47,630
'Hey Gundakka...Gundakka'

1280
01:16:50,210 --> 01:16:51,540
'Hey'

1281
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:52,960
'Do you know who I am?'

1282
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,590
'How will I not know?'

1283
01:16:54,630 --> 01:16:56,500
'You are my dear brother'

1284
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:00,750
'I am not out of my mind,
my dear brother'

1285
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:04,040
Cut...print

1286
01:17:06,210 --> 01:17:07,790
Rama Rao, Nageswara Rao

1287
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:08,920
Fantastic

1288
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:11,250
You acted like real brothers, very good

1289
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:13,840
Why 'very good'?
It is fantastic

1290
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:16,960
When the 2 eyes of our industry
are acting, how will it not be good?

1291
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,460
Come, Bullemma

1292
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:19,540
Good to see you

1293
01:17:19,590 --> 01:17:22,040
I was worried that film company
may not send you

1294
01:17:22,090 --> 01:17:23,210
What happened, sir?

1295
01:17:23,250 --> 01:17:25,790
This story of Gundamma
is right upto my neck

1296
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:28,840
See, I have both Rama Rao
and Nageswara Rao in my cinema

1297
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:31,840
When one gives his date
the other will not and vice versa

1298
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:34,790
- If both do, you will not be free
- Am I not here, sir?

1299
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:36,790
We will be quick
Muththaiyah!

1300
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:38,590
Nageswar Rao
Pack up

1301
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:40,960
Rama Rao, dress change

1302
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,380
- I will drive, you can go
- Hero sir

1303
01:17:43,420 --> 01:17:44,710
Hero garu

1304
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:48,440
- What is it?
- Are you shifting to Hyderabad?

1305
01:17:48,490 --> 01:17:50,650
I heard you are selling your house

1306
01:17:50,690 --> 01:17:52,610
I would like to buy
Will you sell it to me?

1307
01:17:52,650 --> 01:17:53,820
I have no problem

1308
01:17:53,860 --> 01:17:56,070
Gemini and you can
come home next Sunday

1309
01:17:56,110 --> 01:17:58,780
- We can discuss about it
- Why wait till Sunday?

1310
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:04,690
I have signed the check
Fill up any amount you want

1311
01:18:06,110 --> 01:18:07,940
Is this some kind of joke?

1312
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:11,280
Have you become such a big shot
to sign a blank check?

1313
01:18:11,740 --> 01:18:12,820
Listen, Savitri

1314
01:18:13,780 --> 01:18:15,690
Earn more than you can

1315
01:18:15,780 --> 01:18:17,110
I will be happy for you

1316
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:19,900
Do not try to grow above
your hard earned money

1317
01:18:19,940 --> 01:18:21,650
You will face the repercussions

1318
01:18:35,610 --> 01:18:36,990
'Get up, Bullemma'

1319
01:18:37,030 --> 01:18:38,610
'Get up...yes'

1320
01:18:42,150 --> 01:18:43,740
'Start grinding now'

1321
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:48,780
'Bullemma, am I doing a good job?'

1322
01:18:49,570 --> 01:18:51,360
'Why are you smiling at me?'

1323
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:53,150
'I am capable of cooking as well'

1324
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:54,940
'My father is a vedic scholar'

1325
01:18:54,990 --> 01:18:58,900
'It is said, 'if you learn all the chores
your wife will ensure a happy married life'

1326
01:18:58,940 --> 01:19:00,360
'I guess you are unaware'

1327
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:02,990
'Nowadays women are
competing with men?'

1328
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:07,610
"Women's world is enlightened
From their sleep, awakened"

1329
01:19:07,690 --> 01:19:10,280
"Men's world now panic-stricken"

1330
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:11,780
Cut...lights!

1331
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:15,320
'Savitri, what happened to you?'

1332
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,320
I want just 1 more 'take', director sir

1333
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:22,440
1st time I am seeing Savitri
asking for another 'take'

1334
01:19:24,780 --> 01:19:26,360
Concentrate, dear

1335
01:19:28,650 --> 01:19:30,440
Can you give me 1 minute?

1336
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:32,740
Alright, okay

1337
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:41,150
Nothing wrong in what brother said, dear

1338
01:19:41,780 --> 01:19:45,070
When a lightman wanted money
to pay his children's tuition fee

1339
01:19:45,110 --> 01:19:47,110
...you wrote a cheque for Rs 1000

1340
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:50,570
Rs 1000 is the annual income of a poor man

1341
01:19:51,030 --> 01:19:54,990
If you had paid the fees in the school
personally, I would have been happier

1342
01:19:55,030 --> 01:19:56,440
He is a slave to bad habits

1343
01:19:56,490 --> 01:19:59,110
How are we so sure
he will pay the fees?

1344
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:03,780
Should we be vigilant
even when we help?

1345
01:20:03,780 --> 01:20:05,990
We need to guard
our earnings

1346
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:07,780
Respect money

1347
01:20:08,740 --> 01:20:11,070
For women to live with self respect

1348
01:20:11,490 --> 01:20:13,570
...financial freedom is also necessary

1349
01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:17,320
You should be cautious and not
squander away hard earned money

1350
01:20:18,110 --> 01:20:20,780
We are concerned
only for your well being

1351
01:20:22,780 --> 01:20:24,320
Wanting lyrics for this song

1352
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:27,070
...Kamalakara Kameswara Rao
asked the lyricist to write

1353
01:20:27,110 --> 01:20:31,110
Lyricist said, 'Why do you need lyrics
when Savitri can sing with her eyes?'

1354
01:20:32,030 --> 01:20:33,530
Then what, Bullemma?

1355
01:20:47,070 --> 01:20:48,440
Director sir

1356
01:20:48,490 --> 01:20:49,740
- Call for action
- 'Ready'

1357
01:20:49,780 --> 01:20:51,780
- It is getting late
- 'Ready...action!'

1358
01:20:53,690 --> 01:20:56,320
"Vemana our Telugu poet said so long ago"

1359
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:59,030
"Reiterated by Brahmam our Telugu seer too"

1360
01:20:59,070 --> 01:21:02,780
"Beloved, lend me your ear"

1361
01:21:05,740 --> 01:21:08,570
"I am saying this now, my dear"

1362
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:11,320
"Listen to Visanna's veda"

1363
01:21:11,740 --> 01:21:15,360
[song from 'Gundamma Katha']

1364
01:21:16,780 --> 01:21:18,740
Father, look at mother

1365
01:21:18,780 --> 01:21:20,780
She is unwilling to
send me to Nimmakuru

1366
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:23,940
Did you not agree to send me
if I aced my exams?

1367
01:21:23,990 --> 01:21:25,740
You finished your 10th standard

1368
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:28,280
Tell us what you want to be
in life, we will send you

1369
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:30,940
I will build a huge studio
and make films with my father

1370
01:21:30,990 --> 01:21:33,740
Great! Do you need
my dates, dear producer?

1371
01:21:33,780 --> 01:21:36,650
Brother-in-law, he will
start competing with you

1372
01:21:36,780 --> 01:21:38,690
That is alright
He is our boy

1373
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:40,740
Can I go then, father?

1374
01:21:41,820 --> 01:21:42,900
Fine, go

1375
01:21:45,780 --> 01:21:50,280
In Vauhini studio yesterday,
Suryakantham was playing my mother's role

1376
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:52,070
She had to knock me on my head

1377
01:21:52,110 --> 01:21:54,780
She rapped so hard
my head started swelling!

1378
01:21:55,150 --> 01:21:56,650
It is alright, Relangi sir

1379
01:21:56,740 --> 01:21:58,780
In another cinema
she will act as your wife

1380
01:21:58,820 --> 01:22:00,990
You will get your turn
to knock her head!

1381
01:22:01,030 --> 01:22:03,360
Krishnakumari has not
understood the story

1382
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:06,440
Even then Suryakantham will
beat me to a pulp!

1383
01:22:06,490 --> 01:22:08,780
Where will she give me
such an opportunity?

1384
01:22:09,780 --> 01:22:11,360
Brother, join us

1385
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:14,650
Tomorrow is your birthday
No sign of any feast or treat

1386
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:19,360
Tarakam has gone to our home town
I must attend my new film's inauguration

1387
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:21,280
Feast enough
and a special treat

1388
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:23,740
Rama Rao sir, can I talk to you?

1389
01:22:23,780 --> 01:22:24,860
I am coming

1390
01:22:25,860 --> 01:22:29,070
In the next film, I am supposed
to act as Suryakantham's husband

1391
01:22:29,110 --> 01:22:30,740
Take care of your head

1392
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:32,150
Remember that hard knock!

1393
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:35,030
Mr Relangi and CSR sir
are not available for shoot today

1394
01:22:35,070 --> 01:22:37,360
We requested Saradhi and AVM Studio

1395
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:40,490
...to send them over for 4 hours
as today is last day of shoot

1396
01:22:40,530 --> 01:22:43,990
If you agree, I will complete
their shots and send them off

1397
01:22:44,150 --> 01:22:45,570
I do not mind at all

1398
01:22:45,650 --> 01:22:48,440
Relangi sir is in every film
and in constant demand

1399
01:22:48,490 --> 01:22:50,440
CSR sir is our film industry's guru

1400
01:22:50,780 --> 01:22:53,650
It is our duty to appreciate
experience and emergencies

1401
01:22:53,740 --> 01:22:55,440
- Go ahead
- Thank you

1402
01:22:56,110 --> 01:22:57,320
Ready

1403
01:22:58,690 --> 01:23:01,110
'Charu...Charu!'

1404
01:23:01,780 --> 01:23:03,070
'Chaaaaru!'

1405
01:23:05,030 --> 01:23:07,030
You should say
'My precious gem'

1406
01:23:07,070 --> 01:23:09,030
'- What, dear?
- My precious gem'

1407
01:23:09,940 --> 01:23:11,780
Good idea, director sir

1408
01:23:11,780 --> 01:23:13,780
In the title card
with this music

1409
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:15,570
Shoot all of us!

1410
01:23:16,780 --> 01:23:19,150
Very true, 'Irugu Porugu'
which means neighbors

1411
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:22,320
Fits well like this film's title
Even this setting

1412
01:23:24,070 --> 01:23:25,070
Brother

1413
01:23:25,110 --> 01:23:26,820
'We will rehearse once more'

1414
01:23:26,860 --> 01:23:28,860
- What, brother?
- 1 minute

1415
01:23:33,690 --> 01:23:35,110
What is it, brother?

1416
01:23:36,070 --> 01:23:37,780
What is it you are hesitating to tell me?

1417
01:23:37,820 --> 01:23:39,940
- Ramakrishna
- Ramakrishna?

1418
01:23:40,740 --> 01:23:43,860
What happened to Ramakrishna?
His small pox has worsened?

1419
01:23:44,150 --> 01:23:46,030
Did you get a call from home?

1420
01:23:46,070 --> 01:23:48,570
We have to rush to
our hometown right away

1421
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:49,900
Such a young boy

1422
01:23:50,030 --> 01:23:51,900
Cannot be preserved
beyond 1 day

1423
01:24:02,940 --> 01:24:04,940
Let me inform the director

1424
01:24:07,110 --> 01:24:08,780
We will leave after the shooting

1425
01:24:08,780 --> 01:24:10,740
How can you think of shooting now, brother?

1426
01:24:10,780 --> 01:24:13,110
- Your eldest son
- Go and wait in the car

1427
01:24:13,940 --> 01:24:16,570
- I will come
- Not that, brother

1428
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:35,780
What happened, sir?

1429
01:24:36,650 --> 01:24:37,820
'Charu!'

1430
01:24:38,610 --> 01:24:39,820
'Charu...!'

1431
01:24:40,650 --> 01:24:42,110
'Chaaaaru!'

1432
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:47,690
'- What, dear?
- My precious gem!'

1433
01:24:51,070 --> 01:24:52,280
Shot okay

1434
01:24:53,030 --> 01:24:54,360
Namaste, sir

1435
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,360
- See you later
- Thank you, sir

1436
01:24:57,490 --> 01:24:59,280
Next is your shot, guruji

1437
01:25:03,570 --> 01:25:05,860
Okay, brother
All the best

1438
01:25:06,110 --> 01:25:07,690
Tomorrow is your birthday

1439
01:25:07,740 --> 01:25:08,860
See you later

1440
01:25:15,740 --> 01:25:17,570
'Did you call me, dear?'

1441
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:20,280
'I forgot why I called you'

1442
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:21,990
'Oh...that?'

1443
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:25,440
Cut!

1444
01:25:25,650 --> 01:25:27,070
Brother, I am ready

1445
01:25:27,610 --> 01:25:28,780
Sir

1446
01:25:29,650 --> 01:25:31,780
Sir, it is our shot now

1447
01:25:33,820 --> 01:25:34,860
Brother, ready

1448
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:36,150
You come in from this side

1449
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:38,940
You turn around and
throw the paper down

1450
01:25:38,990 --> 01:25:41,110
You will be hiding over there, madam

1451
01:25:41,150 --> 01:25:42,690
You will turn around from there

1452
01:25:42,740 --> 01:25:45,900
Krishna, I am talking to you
and your mind is elsewhere?

1453
01:25:46,030 --> 01:25:49,150
You come here and take
a look at this paper

1454
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:53,070
After you read, he will come out
and take the paper-

1455
01:25:55,530 --> 01:25:57,570
Ready...ready
Have you understood?

1456
01:25:57,610 --> 01:25:58,860
Go, Krishna

1457
01:25:59,070 --> 01:26:00,570
Ready, sir
Take, sir

1458
01:26:00,740 --> 01:26:01,990
Take

1459
01:26:08,530 --> 01:26:09,690
What happened, brother?

1460
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:10,900
- Cut...cut
- Sorry, master

1461
01:26:10,940 --> 01:26:12,110
1 more

1462
01:26:14,110 --> 01:26:15,320
Sorry, Krishnakumari

1463
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:16,690
We will do 1 more 'take'

1464
01:26:17,940 --> 01:26:19,780
'Ready, all lights, take'

1465
01:26:41,940 --> 01:26:43,780
Cut...take okay

1466
01:26:44,490 --> 01:26:45,780
'Pack up'

1467
01:26:49,150 --> 01:26:50,900
Rama Rao sir, thank you

1468
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:53,900
Cinema is over, only the ritual
of breaking the pumpkin is left

1469
01:26:54,030 --> 01:26:55,030
Namaste

1470
01:26:55,070 --> 01:26:56,860
Master, I shall take leave

1471
01:26:57,490 --> 01:26:58,650
Bye, Krishnakumari

1472
01:27:01,820 --> 01:27:04,570
Rama Rao sir, advance happy birthday

1473
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:11,320
Pithambaram 'garu'
what happened to Rama Rao?

1474
01:27:13,780 --> 01:27:15,110
What happened, sir?

1475
01:27:17,650 --> 01:27:20,780
His eldest son Ramakrishna passed away

1476
01:27:21,780 --> 01:27:22,820
Whaaat?

1477
01:27:23,530 --> 01:27:25,780
His son died and he was shooting?

1478
01:27:26,690 --> 01:27:28,030
What is this, sir?

1479
01:27:28,820 --> 01:27:30,490
We could have cancelled it

1480
01:27:30,990 --> 01:27:33,070
And postponed the shoot?

1481
01:27:34,900 --> 01:27:37,610
Is cinema greater than one's own child?

1482
01:27:38,030 --> 01:27:39,940
Why did he do that?

1483
01:27:40,490 --> 01:27:43,990
We may not be able to get the dates
of so many artistes all over again

1484
01:27:44,110 --> 01:27:47,280
He always thinks no one should
incur loss because of him

1485
01:27:48,110 --> 01:27:49,940
Such a selfless intention on his part

1486
01:28:30,610 --> 01:28:33,940
Ramarao, what a tragedy has befallen you

1487
01:28:33,990 --> 01:28:37,490
'Son, Ramakrishna has left us'

1488
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:41,110
Father! Look there

1489
01:28:41,820 --> 01:28:43,070
'Bawa'

1490
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:46,360
He is the one who welcomes you
when you come home

1491
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:48,780
Ask him to get up, dear

1492
01:28:48,780 --> 01:28:51,030
You tell him, dear

1493
01:28:52,650 --> 01:28:55,320
Ask him to get up, bawa

1494
01:28:57,030 --> 01:28:59,070
Please make him get up

1495
01:28:59,780 --> 01:29:02,400
Tell him to get up, bawa

1496
01:29:02,690 --> 01:29:04,150
'What a beautiful face!'

1497
01:29:04,610 --> 01:29:07,440
'Small pox has scarred his face badly'

1498
01:29:07,530 --> 01:29:09,650
'Aiyo! My son!'

1499
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:13,070
Aiyo, Ramu!

1500
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:23,280
Brother-in-law, it is already too late
If you take one last look at him-

1501
01:29:28,610 --> 01:29:32,320
When he left home, he said
'Father, I will see you soon'

1502
01:29:33,530 --> 01:29:35,820
'That image is fresh
right in front of my eyes'

1503
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:38,360
His face scarred by pox marks

1504
01:29:38,690 --> 01:29:40,280
I do not want to see

1505
01:29:40,900 --> 01:29:42,490
In the pupil of my eye

1506
01:29:43,610 --> 01:29:46,110
He should always be glowing like the moon

1507
01:29:46,490 --> 01:29:47,900
Always like that

1508
01:29:54,940 --> 01:29:56,070
Namaste

1509
01:29:57,440 --> 01:30:00,280
Brother, L.V.Prasad sir called again

1510
01:30:00,740 --> 01:30:02,780
He is truly worried for you

1511
01:30:03,860 --> 01:30:07,570
He wanted Ramakrishna to
become a hero after 5 years

1512
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:15,940
How does he know Ramakrishna's dream
was to produce good films?

1513
01:30:20,030 --> 01:30:24,110
KV Reddy sir, Chakrapani sir told me
they are coming here with others

1514
01:30:26,860 --> 01:30:28,490
Not necessary

1515
01:30:29,150 --> 01:30:30,780
Tell them we are coming

1516
01:30:30,780 --> 01:30:33,690
Brother, all shoots have been cancelled

1517
01:30:33,860 --> 01:30:36,360
Shooting will commence
only after 15 days

1518
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:38,780
Tell them we are leaving tonight

1519
01:30:39,650 --> 01:30:43,070
I will be at the shooting spot
with make-up at 7:00 a.m sharp

1520
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:48,400
Under these circumstances...?

1521
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:53,400
Whatever the circumstance
work numbs the pain and provides solace

1522
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:57,990
I must work now

1523
01:30:58,860 --> 01:31:00,780
3 shifts a day

1524
01:31:04,780 --> 01:31:08,940
'I should not even have time to see
my face without make up in the mirror'

1525
01:31:09,030 --> 01:31:11,780
'I will meet the producers
who were waiting for my call'

1526
01:31:11,780 --> 01:31:13,900
'I will accept all the stories
narrated to me'

1527
01:31:13,940 --> 01:31:17,320
'When there are no producers
we will produce the film'

1528
01:31:17,480 --> 01:31:21,560
'I should live the role, even in my sleep
I must get into the skin of the character'

1529
01:31:31,060 --> 01:31:32,230
'Maharaja!'

1530
01:31:32,270 --> 01:31:34,730
'For the sins you committed
like a tiger in sheep's clothing'

1531
01:31:34,770 --> 01:31:36,810
'...apologise to the people
as redemption'

1532
01:31:36,850 --> 01:31:37,980
'Or else'

1533
01:31:38,060 --> 01:31:39,060
'Or else'

1534
01:31:39,100 --> 01:31:40,230
'Downfall!'

1535
01:31:40,730 --> 01:31:41,810
'Cut!'

1536
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:46,980
- Where is the art director?
- Here, sir

1537
01:31:47,020 --> 01:31:48,480
What is this, Krishna Rao?

1538
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:50,440
How can the chain be so flimsy?

1539
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:52,060
Make sure it does not come off

1540
01:31:52,100 --> 01:31:53,440
Vittalacharya sir

1541
01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:56,020
These dummy chains cannot
withstand my anger

1542
01:31:56,060 --> 01:31:57,440
Please get iron chains

1543
01:31:57,480 --> 01:31:58,850
Real iron chains

1544
01:31:58,980 --> 01:32:01,640
Iron chains will be heavy, Rama Rao sir

1545
01:32:01,730 --> 01:32:03,440
It can hurt your wrists

1546
01:32:03,770 --> 01:32:05,270
Vittalacharya sir

1547
01:32:05,310 --> 01:32:07,480
If I cannot bear this pain

1548
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:10,480
...how can I enact
the struggles of this society

1549
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:13,480
A man is born into
this world through pain

1550
01:32:13,730 --> 01:32:15,730
We cannot live without pain

1551
01:32:16,190 --> 01:32:18,100
- Continue
- Take 2

1552
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:20,060
- Action
- 'Downfall'

1553
01:32:20,190 --> 01:32:22,810
'A rule unable to protect
its people should be abdicated'

1554
01:32:22,850 --> 01:32:26,480
'These skeletons will
unite as brave warriors'

1555
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:31,480
'Each one of them, brick by brick,
will demolish your kingdom's foundation'

1556
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:43,040
'Will you not share that secret?'

1557
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:44,700
'The secret of that feat'

1558
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:48,720
'Other than Arjuna, no one else knows'

1559
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,960
'You have entangled us into
a complicated net, Brihannala garu'

1560
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,330
'I will myself unearth that secret'

1561
01:32:54,380 --> 01:32:57,790
'Once this Uttara Kumar sets his mind
he can meet any challenge'

1562
01:32:58,170 --> 01:32:59,670
'Alright, Brihannala garu'

1563
01:32:59,710 --> 01:33:02,460
'How much has Uttaraa learnt as a dancer?'

1564
01:33:02,540 --> 01:33:03,880
'Nearing completion'

1565
01:33:04,540 --> 01:33:06,670
'- Want to test?
- Let her learn fully'

1566
01:33:06,710 --> 01:33:09,330
'- I will watch her dance
- You will be the best judge'

1567
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:13,420
'Sister, from now on wind up
your dance, song and mischief'

1568
01:33:13,460 --> 01:33:15,830
'You should prove you are
unsurpassable as a dancer'

1569
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:19,790
'Watching you dance
Abhimanyu should faint'

1570
01:33:19,830 --> 01:33:21,960
'Brother, you love teasing me'

1571
01:33:22,630 --> 01:33:24,330
'Did you notice that, Brihannala garu?'

1572
01:33:24,380 --> 01:33:27,630
'My sister blushes when she hears
the name 'Abhimanyu'?'

1573
01:33:27,670 --> 01:33:31,040
'I really feel Abhimanyu is
the perfect match for my sister'

1574
01:33:31,130 --> 01:33:33,460
'What do you say?
Yes or no?'

1575
01:33:34,670 --> 01:33:36,750
'When you say yes, will I say no?'

1576
01:33:37,420 --> 01:33:39,460
'If I say no, will you keep quiet?'

1577
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:41,750
'That is why I will say yes'

1578
01:33:42,790 --> 01:33:44,500
'You are smart, Brihannala garu'

1579
01:33:44,630 --> 01:33:46,000
'I take leave'

1580
01:33:46,290 --> 01:33:47,630
'Cut'

1581
01:33:50,710 --> 01:33:53,830
No one can even imagine
the role of Gireesam

1582
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:56,420
No one can do the role of Brihannala

1583
01:33:56,500 --> 01:33:59,420
You have done more than justice
to both the roles

1584
01:33:59,540 --> 01:34:00,880
Shall I tell you something?

1585
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:03,920
Because you are Telugu
that English man does not know

1586
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:07,210
If you had been that English man
no one could have caught you

1587
01:34:07,290 --> 01:34:09,460
- You flatter me
- It is true

1588
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:12,750
We got a research center called NTR
for our Telugu cinema

1589
01:34:12,790 --> 01:34:15,750
We can try any experiment here

1590
01:34:15,790 --> 01:34:18,040
Brother, 1st shall we shoot?

1591
01:34:18,290 --> 01:34:19,420
Such a noble soul!!

1592
01:34:19,460 --> 01:34:23,750
He woke me up at 3:00 a.m daily and
made me practice for 3 months at a stretch

1593
01:34:23,790 --> 01:34:28,790
"Notes, count, rhythm in unison chime"

1594
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:32,670
[song from 'Nartanasala']

1595
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:38,790
"Notes, count, rhythm in unison chime"

1596
01:34:38,790 --> 01:34:44,000
"To her anklets tinkling divine"

1597
01:34:44,210 --> 01:34:46,630
- Look,Rama Rao is so beautiful
- Yes,sir

1598
01:34:46,670 --> 01:34:51,040
"Goddess Shakti danced to their rhyme"

1599
01:34:51,130 --> 01:34:56,710
"Lord Shiva's heart in that time
soaked in happiness sublime"

1600
01:34:59,540 --> 01:35:00,710
Hello?

1601
01:35:01,380 --> 01:35:02,580
Really?

1602
01:35:02,670 --> 01:35:04,460
Lakshmi, switch on the radio

1603
01:35:04,630 --> 01:35:06,750
Sister-in-law

1604
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:10,500
'Govt of India has announced
the recipients of Padma Shri award'

1605
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:13,960
'From Telugu cinema,
Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao'

1606
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,830
'And Akkineni Nageswara Rao
have been chosen as awardees'

1607
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:17,880
Brother

1608
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:20,330
'2 heroes being jointly chosen
for the same language'

1609
01:35:20,380 --> 01:35:23,210
'1st time in the history
of Padma Shri awards'

1610
01:35:23,290 --> 01:35:28,130
'Mr Sunil Dutt has been chosen to
receive the Padma Shri in Hindi cinema'

1611
01:35:38,210 --> 01:35:40,710
Namaste, madam

1612
01:35:41,880 --> 01:35:44,420
'I am Raja Singh
from Gorakhpur, madam'

1613
01:35:44,500 --> 01:35:46,710
I know you
I know your father too

1614
01:35:46,750 --> 01:35:48,500
I have met him
in a conference

1615
01:35:48,540 --> 01:35:50,420
Most powerful leader in the world

1616
01:35:50,460 --> 01:35:51,920
Namaste, Mr Khan

1617
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:55,710
People claim though she is a woman
no man has the guts to rival her

1618
01:35:56,290 --> 01:35:58,330
Women will be proud
of their gender, brother

1619
01:35:58,380 --> 01:36:00,960
They should look up to her
as their ideal idol!

1620
01:36:01,170 --> 01:36:03,920
- Mr Nageswara Rao, how are you?
- Greetings, Mr Narasimha Rao

1621
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:06,040
Mr Rama Rao, I am P.V.Narasimha Rao

1622
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:08,080
How can anyone not know you?

1623
01:36:08,210 --> 01:36:11,040
Let me introduce you
to our prime minister

1624
01:36:13,170 --> 01:36:16,500
Madam, Rama Rao ji
and Nageswar Rao ji

1625
01:36:16,580 --> 01:36:18,170
2 eyes of Telugu cinema

1626
01:36:18,290 --> 01:36:19,080
Namaste

1627
01:36:19,130 --> 01:36:21,630
I am very happy to meet both of you

1628
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:24,880
To tell you the truth we have
a deep bond with Madras

1629
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:27,630
We love your 'idli'
'dosa' and 'sambar'

1630
01:36:27,670 --> 01:36:29,880
Madrasis have a flair
for good food, madam

1631
01:36:31,130 --> 01:36:33,750
They are not just 'foodies', Shukla ji

1632
01:36:33,790 --> 01:36:35,960
They have stalwarts as leaders too

1633
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:38,080
Like Sarvepalli Radhakrishanan ji

1634
01:36:38,130 --> 01:36:39,460
Mr V.V.Giri

1635
01:36:39,830 --> 01:36:41,580
Our P.V sir

1636
01:36:41,830 --> 01:36:42,880
Madam

1637
01:36:43,670 --> 01:36:45,000
I am not from Madras

1638
01:36:45,380 --> 01:36:47,580
I am a Telugu from Andhra

1639
01:36:47,630 --> 01:36:50,880
What is this Andhra and Tamil Nadu?
All are Madrasis from South India?

1640
01:36:50,920 --> 01:36:52,210
How can that be?

1641
01:36:52,790 --> 01:36:54,130
We hail from Andhra

1642
01:36:54,330 --> 01:36:55,750
We have an identity of our own

1643
01:36:55,790 --> 01:36:57,790
Our self respect
and our own tradition

1644
01:36:57,790 --> 01:37:00,130
How can everyone be slotted as Madrasis?

1645
01:37:00,170 --> 01:37:02,330
We both are selected for Padma Shri

1646
01:37:02,380 --> 01:37:05,750
And we are from Andhra Pradesh
Madam Prime minister

1647
01:37:48,580 --> 01:37:51,460
Brother, looks like
your mind is not on the game

1648
01:37:53,580 --> 01:37:55,380
More than the joy of
receiving Padma Shri

1649
01:37:55,420 --> 01:37:57,880
I am hurt about being
categorized as Madrasi

1650
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:02,130
Why do you think
I shifted to Hyderabad?

1651
01:38:02,170 --> 01:38:04,330
So I will not be slotted like this!

1652
01:38:06,420 --> 01:38:08,670
How about thinking of
settling down in Hyderabad?

1653
01:38:08,710 --> 01:38:12,540
Whatever it is, our industry
should be within our territory

1654
01:38:12,750 --> 01:38:14,790
This is not an issue
pertaining to our industry

1655
01:38:14,790 --> 01:38:16,630
It affects our entire Telugu community

1656
01:38:16,670 --> 01:38:20,380
Even after obtaining our own state
we are classified as 'Madrasi'

1657
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:22,380
A change has to dawn

1658
01:38:22,420 --> 01:38:25,630
Our lineage has to be respected
Our language has to be revered

1659
01:38:25,670 --> 01:38:28,380
Wisdom of our Telugu blood
must spread nation wide

1660
01:38:33,710 --> 01:38:36,330
'Emergency was declared
throughout the nation'

1661
01:38:36,380 --> 01:38:40,210
'Whichever political party opposed
the affairs of the central Govt'

1662
01:38:40,290 --> 01:38:42,790
'...was taken to task by the military'

1663
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,130
'Voice of democracy was locked'

1664
01:38:46,170 --> 01:38:49,750
'As stated by
Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh'

1665
01:38:54,460 --> 01:38:57,750
'Youth leader, chief minister's son'

1666
01:38:57,790 --> 01:39:01,960
'Muthuvel Karunanidhi Stalin
was taken into custody'

1667
01:39:02,290 --> 01:39:04,500
'And tortured brutally'

1668
01:39:04,710 --> 01:39:07,420
'The entire State protested in fury'

1669
01:39:07,750 --> 01:39:10,830
'Tamil Nadu changed into a sea of fire'

1670
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,330
'Law & order crumbled'

1671
01:39:13,420 --> 01:39:15,210
'May this revolution flourish!'

1672
01:39:15,880 --> 01:39:17,210
Where are you going?

1673
01:39:18,420 --> 01:39:20,170
Rama Rao sir?

1674
01:39:20,210 --> 01:39:21,960
Please go quickly, sir

1675
01:39:23,420 --> 01:39:24,580
Stop!

1676
01:39:25,540 --> 01:39:27,630
There is a riot brewing, sir

1677
01:39:27,670 --> 01:39:29,210
Please go, sir

1678
01:39:40,790 --> 01:39:42,170
Inspector 'garu'

1679
01:39:42,460 --> 01:39:44,040
This guides our daily life

1680
01:39:44,630 --> 01:39:46,920
It should not be
lying like this on the road

1681
01:39:56,040 --> 01:39:57,130
Go

1682
01:39:59,380 --> 01:40:02,380
'Authority of all Govt officials
was cancelled'

1683
01:40:02,540 --> 01:40:04,920
'Emergency rule has been
imposed nationwide'

1684
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:07,130
'Jails are over flowing with people'

1685
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:10,790
'Prime minister's son Sanjay Gandhi
who held no official post'

1686
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,880
'...is ruling the nation
with an iron hand of a dictator'

1687
01:40:14,170 --> 01:40:19,710
'Pedestrians on the road are being
subjected to sterilization under duress'

1688
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:22,920
'This is a black day
for democracy'

1689
01:40:23,080 --> 01:40:24,670
'As stated by the Opposition party'

1690
01:40:24,710 --> 01:40:25,710
Hello?

1691
01:40:27,380 --> 01:40:31,330
Sir, I am an ordinary make-up technician

1692
01:40:31,460 --> 01:40:33,540
NTR sir made me a producer

1693
01:40:33,790 --> 01:40:36,960
With him and Balayya sir
I produced 'Annadammula Anubandham'

1694
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:38,880
He gave me such a golden chance

1695
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:40,040
But, sir-

1696
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:41,920
What is the matter, Pithambaram sir?

1697
01:40:44,420 --> 01:40:46,710
Our film is not releasing
day after tomorrow, sir

1698
01:40:46,750 --> 01:40:50,040
N.T.Rama Rao's cinema is
not releasing as per schedule?

1699
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:52,420
What are you saying?

1700
01:40:52,500 --> 01:40:53,670
Hello?

1701
01:40:53,710 --> 01:40:57,210
Sir, I am unable to send
the print out of the lab

1702
01:40:57,500 --> 01:40:59,080
Whole city is under curfew

1703
01:40:59,170 --> 01:41:01,710
Cannot even reach the railway station

1704
01:41:01,750 --> 01:41:06,170
Distributors are worried
your fans may cause damage to theaters

1705
01:41:06,210 --> 01:41:09,960
They are plaguing me with phone calls
I do not know what to do

1706
01:41:10,040 --> 01:41:12,130
I am already drowning in difficulties

1707
01:41:12,210 --> 01:41:15,670
I referred your name, borrowed money
and produced this film

1708
01:41:15,710 --> 01:41:17,960
If the film does not release tomorrow?

1709
01:41:18,210 --> 01:41:20,000
I am in a state of shock, sir

1710
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:21,710
Do not worry, Pithambaram

1711
01:41:21,790 --> 01:41:23,000
I am there for you

1712
01:41:23,500 --> 01:41:24,960
This does not affect only you

1713
01:41:25,290 --> 01:41:26,920
It is a prestige issue for me also

1714
01:41:27,210 --> 01:41:28,750
At any cost

1715
01:41:28,790 --> 01:41:30,790
N.T.R cinema has to be released

1716
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,080
Alright, sir

1717
01:41:32,130 --> 01:41:34,790
Cinema is toil and sweat
of a large group of people

1718
01:41:34,790 --> 01:41:37,210
Future of so many families

1719
01:41:37,380 --> 01:41:39,540
Faith that millions of
viewers place on us

1720
01:41:39,580 --> 01:41:42,130
No Emergency has the right to stop this

1721
01:41:42,170 --> 01:41:44,790
You stay there
I am coming over

1722
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:47,460
Father?
Hari...?

1723
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:49,080
This is Pithambaram's 1st release

1724
01:41:49,130 --> 01:41:50,830
He cannot bear it
if it does not release

1725
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:52,000
Father?

1726
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:54,670
Come with me
I am going to the lab

1727
01:41:54,710 --> 01:41:56,210
Brother, there is a curfew

1728
01:41:56,420 --> 01:41:58,420
- So what?
- Driver has not come either

1729
01:41:58,460 --> 01:41:59,750
Do I not know to drive?

1730
01:41:59,790 --> 01:42:02,380
After all curfew, uncle
Passenger is N.T.R!

1731
01:42:07,540 --> 01:42:09,380
- Who, sir?
- Can you not recognize?

1732
01:42:09,420 --> 01:42:10,420
N.T.R!

1733
01:42:10,460 --> 01:42:12,580
Good afternoon, sir
Lab is closed

1734
01:42:12,630 --> 01:42:14,380
We have orders
not to allow anyone inside

1735
01:42:14,420 --> 01:42:15,540
What?!

1736
01:42:16,790 --> 01:42:17,830
Father-

1737
01:42:19,960 --> 01:42:22,420
Sir, wait
You cannot go in

1738
01:42:42,540 --> 01:42:44,290
Pithambaram, print is ready?

1739
01:42:44,330 --> 01:42:46,460
None of the workers have turned up, sir

1740
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:48,880
Those who are here are scared
to load the prints

1741
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:50,880
They have stopped
the release of my film

1742
01:42:50,920 --> 01:42:53,210
Even after I told them
this is not Tamil cinema

1743
01:42:53,290 --> 01:42:54,290
- Hari
- Father

1744
01:42:54,330 --> 01:42:55,630
Bring the van here

1745
01:42:55,670 --> 01:42:57,880
Brother, load the prints into the van

1746
01:42:57,920 --> 01:42:59,460
We will talk to Mr Vasan

1747
01:42:59,540 --> 01:43:01,170
You go and do your work

1748
01:43:01,830 --> 01:43:03,750
Do not be scared
I am there for you

1749
01:43:03,790 --> 01:43:05,170
Thank you, sir

1750
01:43:09,540 --> 01:43:11,670
'Annadammula Anubandham'

1751
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:24,000
What is this?
What is happening here?

1752
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:26,130
N.T.R's cinema is releasing

1753
01:43:26,920 --> 01:43:29,420
What are you waiting for?
Go ahead and load

1754
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:32,790
Riot and violence are rampant
following the CM's arrest

1755
01:43:32,790 --> 01:43:34,130
Curfew has been imposed

1756
01:43:34,170 --> 01:43:35,580
Emergency has been declared

1757
01:43:35,630 --> 01:43:39,000
Of course, your Emergency
pertains to authority

1758
01:43:39,420 --> 01:43:42,920
My urgency is for the sake
of millions of fans who believe in me

1759
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:45,290
Sir, without prior approval

1760
01:43:45,380 --> 01:43:47,790
...we have strict orders to stop
any work at any place

1761
01:43:47,790 --> 01:43:48,880
Whose approval?

1762
01:43:48,920 --> 01:43:52,710
During Emergency rule you need
police approval for any task

1763
01:43:52,750 --> 01:43:54,830
Otherwise I have
the right to arrest you

1764
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:58,080
In that case you will not have
enough trains for our fans who will revolt

1765
01:43:58,130 --> 01:44:00,080
Will your jails be able to accommodate?

1766
01:44:00,790 --> 01:44:03,080
Brother, we have loaded the prints

1767
01:44:04,420 --> 01:44:07,830
You have deposed the ruling party
and imprisoned the general public

1768
01:44:07,880 --> 01:44:12,170
You want to bury the people's basic rights
under prime minister's authority

1769
01:44:12,580 --> 01:44:15,880
You are breaking down our system
for the sake of individuals

1770
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Imposed Emergency rule,
thinking no one will question you

1771
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:20,380
He will come soon

1772
01:44:20,460 --> 01:44:22,460
One who will question you will come

1773
01:44:22,540 --> 01:44:26,170
He will arrive to wipe out decades of
arrogance embedded in our nation

1774
01:44:26,420 --> 01:44:30,460
Then the ruling party will know
the true meaning of Emergency!

1775
01:44:32,500 --> 01:44:33,880
Mr Rama Rao

1776
01:44:35,670 --> 01:44:38,130
You may not be armed with
our dummy cinema guns

1777
01:44:38,210 --> 01:44:42,130
This heart which breathes cinema
will not be scared of your gunshot

1778
01:44:42,790 --> 01:44:44,670
We will go ahead with our mission

1779
01:44:44,710 --> 01:44:46,790
If you want to stop
go right ahead

1780
01:45:21,540 --> 01:45:23,170
He is a true hero, sir

1781
01:45:24,580 --> 01:45:25,790
N.T.R

1782
01:45:26,630 --> 01:45:28,920
With make-up, a hero

1783
01:45:29,290 --> 01:45:30,920
Without make-up

1784
01:45:31,630 --> 01:45:33,540
More than a hero!

1785
01:45:49,170 --> 01:45:53,580
Hey Dhandapani, I believe Dilip Kumar and
Raj Kapoor wanted to watch our film 'Julie'

1786
01:45:53,630 --> 01:45:56,540
- Arrange for a show in Bombay for them
- Alright, sir

1787
01:45:56,750 --> 01:45:59,210
I feel lost without Chakrapani

1788
01:45:59,380 --> 01:46:01,170
How is his health now, sir?

1789
01:46:01,380 --> 01:46:04,580
Cigarettes have burnt that man's life

1790
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:07,170
He will never pay heed
to anyone's advice

1791
01:46:07,290 --> 01:46:09,540
Do you listen to me, hmmm?

1792
01:46:10,210 --> 01:46:13,130
How many times I have told you
not to be impulsive or angry?

1793
01:46:13,290 --> 01:46:15,880
That ACP spared you
being a Telugu himself

1794
01:46:15,960 --> 01:46:18,790
Without any qualms
he has beaten up CM's son, Stalin

1795
01:46:18,920 --> 01:46:21,710
And arrested the chief minister
Where do we stand?

1796
01:46:21,790 --> 01:46:24,210
Not even trying is
equal to committing suicide

1797
01:46:24,290 --> 01:46:26,080
I am not such a coward

1798
01:46:26,170 --> 01:46:27,920
More than me
my films are important

1799
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:29,920
My fans are my foremost priority

1800
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:35,080
I do not know where
your anger will take you

1801
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:37,000
Come, sit down

1802
01:46:38,040 --> 01:46:39,420
What brings you here?

1803
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,630
I am constructing a studio
in Hyderabad for Ramakrishna

1804
01:46:42,670 --> 01:46:44,830
- I need your advice
- Are you mad?

1805
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:47,460
What is in Hyderabad
other than boulders?

1806
01:46:47,580 --> 01:46:50,750
When the film industry is here
why build a studio over there?

1807
01:46:50,790 --> 01:46:53,170
My deepest desire is
our industry moves to Hyderabad

1808
01:46:53,210 --> 01:46:55,540
Brother Nageswar Rao is also
building a studio there

1809
01:46:55,580 --> 01:46:58,380
Rama Rao, to expect the industry
to follow only you

1810
01:46:58,420 --> 01:47:01,460
...both of you are
not the only heroes

1811
01:47:01,790 --> 01:47:03,880
Look at this article, read it

1812
01:47:05,420 --> 01:47:07,170
Written by Kagada Sharma

1813
01:47:07,630 --> 01:47:10,420
Krishna is making a film called
'Kurukshetram' with his sons

1814
01:47:10,460 --> 01:47:14,130
Junior heroes challenge
the senior star heroes

1815
01:47:14,170 --> 01:47:16,170
Will they accept this challenge?

1816
01:47:16,920 --> 01:47:20,380
Rama Rao, Krishna and Shoban Babu
have entered this field

1817
01:47:20,580 --> 01:47:23,170
They have revealed your age
to the general public

1818
01:47:23,210 --> 01:47:25,670
If your film released once a month

1819
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:27,880
...not even 1 flopped in a year

1820
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:31,290
But now it is rare for even 1 film
to taste the joy of success

1821
01:47:31,420 --> 01:47:34,790
However great we may be
we must accept change

1822
01:47:34,830 --> 01:47:39,170
To sum it up in a nutshell, you need
a runaway success like 'Mayabazar'

1823
01:47:39,580 --> 01:47:41,080
Do you have such a film?

1824
01:47:41,130 --> 01:47:44,080
This is not the age
to fight with passage of time

1825
01:47:46,580 --> 01:47:49,880
We should give Time
only 1 golden chance to win over us

1826
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:53,540
After we pass over, Time can be
proud of being the winner

1827
01:47:54,080 --> 01:47:55,170
I will see

1828
01:47:55,790 --> 01:47:56,920
I take leave now

1829
01:48:02,580 --> 01:48:06,290
You have come home for the 1st time
after we shifted here, brother

1830
01:48:06,790 --> 01:48:08,380
You could have brought
your wife too

1831
01:48:08,460 --> 01:48:09,580
She will be coming soon

1832
01:48:09,630 --> 01:48:11,920
Are we not settling down
in Hyderabad very soon?

1833
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:13,080
Serve me now

1834
01:48:13,630 --> 01:48:17,290
We got this fish from river Krishna
because it is your favorite

1835
01:48:17,670 --> 01:48:20,170
Even if he says 'no'
you keep serving him

1836
01:48:20,250 --> 01:48:22,130
We are not in the habit
of saying 'enough'

1837
01:48:22,170 --> 01:48:25,330
Only you will count your calories
and starve your taste buds

1838
01:48:26,040 --> 01:48:29,750
Sister, do not fell shy
Just keep serving non stop

1839
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:32,210
Listen, brother

1840
01:48:32,920 --> 01:48:35,750
What about that challenge
by Kagada Sharma?

1841
01:48:36,750 --> 01:48:39,000
Young heroes
and star heroes

1842
01:48:39,960 --> 01:48:41,080
What do we do?

1843
01:48:41,130 --> 01:48:43,130
'Daana Veera Soora Karna'

1844
01:48:43,210 --> 01:48:45,330
- What?
- Which I will direct

1845
01:48:46,040 --> 01:48:48,080
If you act as Lord Krishna
I will play Karna

1846
01:48:48,130 --> 01:48:50,000
If you choose Karna
I will be Krishna

1847
01:48:50,040 --> 01:48:51,250
Choice is yours

1848
01:48:51,330 --> 01:48:54,750
And my dream of directing you
will also be fulfilled

1849
01:48:59,080 --> 01:49:01,210
I would love to take up this offer too

1850
01:49:01,790 --> 01:49:07,000
Besides it will prove to our fans
we have no difference of opinion too

1851
01:49:07,830 --> 01:49:09,080
But-

1852
01:49:09,170 --> 01:49:10,540
What, brother?

1853
01:49:12,330 --> 01:49:16,290
I have promised Annapoorna
I will not act in a mythology film with you

1854
01:49:16,380 --> 01:49:17,670
What?

1855
01:49:17,750 --> 01:49:21,000
Yes, brother, during the shoot of
'Sri Krishnarjuna Yuddhamu'

1856
01:49:21,040 --> 01:49:23,540
Whichever hero he acts with
in any mythological film

1857
01:49:23,630 --> 01:49:25,710
...viewers look only at you!

1858
01:49:25,960 --> 01:49:28,500
Only yesterday I watched
Hindi cinema 'Sangam'

1859
01:49:28,540 --> 01:49:30,330
Starring Raj Kapoor, Rajendra Kumar

1860
01:49:30,380 --> 01:49:32,170
Remake that in Telugu

1861
01:49:32,500 --> 01:49:36,670
He can choose either hero's role
I am fine with that

1862
01:49:36,710 --> 01:49:39,040
That is a love story, right?

1863
01:49:39,380 --> 01:49:42,000
So your husband can
walk away with the laurels?

1864
01:49:48,210 --> 01:49:51,130
Brother, do you still smoke
or have you kicked that habit?

1865
01:49:51,630 --> 01:49:55,290
One shot in the morning
Depending on my role sometimes

1866
01:49:55,330 --> 01:49:56,790
I am sailing in the same boat!

1867
01:49:56,830 --> 01:49:59,380
After my by-pass
I take a shot only in a shot!

1868
01:49:59,750 --> 01:50:01,920
Now in the joy of meeting you

1869
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:05,750
This is a bad habit, brother

1870
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,290
You smoke in front of elders
you are insulting them

1871
01:50:08,330 --> 01:50:10,630
In front of youngsters
you are encouraging them

1872
01:50:10,670 --> 01:50:12,920
You smoke with friends
you are making it habit

1873
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:16,040
If not in front of elders,
youngsters or with friends

1874
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:18,380
...whom will you smoke with, brother?

1875
01:50:18,830 --> 01:50:20,750
People of equal status and wavelength

1876
01:50:20,830 --> 01:50:22,250
Either with you alone

1877
01:50:22,330 --> 01:50:24,250
Or all alone by myself

1878
01:50:26,170 --> 01:50:30,670
You have a script on
Chanakya Chandragupta, right?

1879
01:50:31,880 --> 01:50:33,500
Let us do that, brother

1880
01:50:33,540 --> 01:50:36,960
I will play Chanakya
and you be Chandragupta

1881
01:50:37,080 --> 01:50:38,630
Historical subject, right?

1882
01:50:38,670 --> 01:50:39,960
No problem

1883
01:50:41,130 --> 01:50:42,670
Okay, brother

1884
01:50:42,710 --> 01:50:44,960
Chanakya was written for me

1885
01:50:45,290 --> 01:50:47,580
I will gladly give it up for you

1886
01:50:47,710 --> 01:50:51,080
1st let me make this film on Karna
and release it in mid-January

1887
01:50:51,790 --> 01:50:55,920
Along with Duryodhana I will also
play the roles of Karna and Lord Krishna

1888
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,380
- All the best, brother
- Thank you

1889
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:03,960
"With Hanuman on my flag as my mascot"

1890
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:08,580
"With steady steed in front that trot"

1891
01:51:09,170 --> 01:51:13,830
"Like the way I hold in my hand
the flute as a magic wand"

1892
01:51:13,880 --> 01:51:16,000
[song from 'Sri Krishna Rayabaram']

1893
01:51:16,040 --> 01:51:19,920
"Let this war begin astute
and end on a victory note"

1894
01:51:19,960 --> 01:51:21,080
Cut

1895
01:51:21,130 --> 01:51:22,330
- Mr Kannappa
- Sir

1896
01:51:22,380 --> 01:51:25,960
Mask shots of Krishna are done
I will get dressed as Duryodhana

1897
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:27,040
Alright, sir

1898
01:51:27,080 --> 01:51:29,710
- Set up the next mask shots
- Come, Pithambaram garu

1899
01:51:29,750 --> 01:51:32,460
We have our studio work
and new projects to attend to

1900
01:51:32,500 --> 01:51:35,040
On top of all this
why these roles for me, father?

1901
01:51:35,080 --> 01:51:36,710
We may have 1000s of tasks to do

1902
01:51:36,750 --> 01:51:38,710
But persistence and planning will do

1903
01:51:38,750 --> 01:51:40,830
Check if the food is ready

1904
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:42,040
Wait

1905
01:51:42,630 --> 01:51:44,960
Is that moustache Arjuna's
or the king of Anga's?

1906
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:46,330
I am Arjuna

1907
01:51:46,380 --> 01:51:50,790
Arjuna's means your moustache should
be slim and smart, not like this

1908
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:52,960
Mr Pithambaram
Please take note

1909
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:54,210
Keep in mind, 'Nartanasala'

1910
01:51:54,250 --> 01:51:56,540
Thank God he does not want me
to act as Brihannala

1911
01:51:56,580 --> 01:51:58,000
Is food ready?

1912
01:51:59,830 --> 01:52:02,210
Narayana Reddy sir
What are you writing now?

1913
01:52:02,290 --> 01:52:06,000
I have just now penned a song
for 'Kurukshetram' cinema

1914
01:52:06,040 --> 01:52:10,080
"Veena strummed its strings in joyful aura
in the garden of love in mohana raga"

1915
01:52:10,130 --> 01:52:11,630
Beautiful stanza

1916
01:52:12,380 --> 01:52:15,330
Perfect duet between
Duryodhana and his wife Banumathi

1917
01:52:15,380 --> 01:52:20,170
A duet between Duryodhana and Banumathi?

1918
01:52:20,290 --> 01:52:21,880
What do you think?

1919
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:25,920
No one else will come up with
such an idea other than you

1920
01:52:25,960 --> 01:52:28,920
Other than me no one will
get such a wonderful chance

1921
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:31,080
Marvellous...miraculous!

1922
01:52:32,500 --> 01:52:34,580
'Chitram! Bhalare Vichitram!!'

1923
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:36,130
This can be our song title

1924
01:52:36,170 --> 01:52:38,380
You pen the lyrics
I will change my costume

1925
01:52:38,500 --> 01:52:39,710
Yes, sir

1926
01:52:40,630 --> 01:52:47,580
"When Arjuna with Gandeeva bow
kills your warriors with his swift arrow"

1927
01:52:47,710 --> 01:52:55,670
"Even if Karna's form in million extends
as one by one Arjuna beheads"

1928
01:52:57,920 --> 01:52:59,040
Cut!

1929
01:52:59,630 --> 01:53:03,380
Kannappan sir, send the prints
of these 3 getups to the lab for checking

1930
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,830
- Vempati Satyam sir
- Namaste, brother

1931
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:08,880
My own eyes will cast a spell on you!

1932
01:53:08,920 --> 01:53:10,670
I do not know
what you will do

1933
01:53:10,710 --> 01:53:12,250
In 'Daana Veera Soora Karna'

1934
01:53:12,330 --> 01:53:15,630
I want the whole world to exclaim
'Vempati Satyam's dance was the highlight'

1935
01:53:15,670 --> 01:53:17,380
Your wish is my command!

1936
01:53:17,460 --> 01:53:18,960
Rama Rao sir

1937
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:22,880
Vempati Satyam sir, has anyone
conceived a duet for Duryodhana?

1938
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:24,540
Only an idiot will think of that!

1939
01:53:24,580 --> 01:53:25,830
Brother has

1940
01:53:26,540 --> 01:53:27,830
Aiyo!

1941
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:30,330
I have in my film

1942
01:53:30,380 --> 01:53:32,880
Duryodhana and Banumathi
will sing a duet

1943
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:36,130
Brother, I thought it was
in 'Kurukshetram' cinema

1944
01:53:36,170 --> 01:53:37,330
And I blabbered

1945
01:53:37,380 --> 01:53:39,670
As if Duryodhana is not
a handsome young man

1946
01:53:39,710 --> 01:53:42,330
Will he not be able to sing
and emote beautifully?

1947
01:53:42,380 --> 01:53:44,380
You turned the table so beautifully!

1948
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:47,540
Follow the camera like this

1949
01:53:47,580 --> 01:53:50,130
2 cameras
1 tight, 1 mid range

1950
01:53:54,920 --> 01:53:56,960
Brother, shall we go for a take?

1951
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:58,330
'Take'

1952
01:53:58,750 --> 01:54:02,330
"Heavenly...hey marvellous!"

1953
01:54:02,500 --> 01:54:06,000
"Magical...miraculous"

1954
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:10,000
"You enticed the king to your palace"

1955
01:54:10,040 --> 01:54:11,580
"A feat so fabulous"

1956
01:54:11,630 --> 01:54:15,000
"Of his own accord my king visited me"

1957
01:54:15,040 --> 01:54:16,540
"Wondrous truly"

1958
01:54:16,580 --> 01:54:20,170
"Super...astounding!"

1959
01:54:20,210 --> 01:54:24,000
"Superb...astonishing!"

1960
01:54:24,130 --> 01:54:26,040
Lift it higher

1961
01:54:26,210 --> 01:54:30,170
Kannappa sir, strings tied for the moon
are visible, kindly go and check

1962
01:54:30,330 --> 01:54:32,830
How long did he give you
to pen this song?

1963
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:33,960
1 hour 30 minutes

1964
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,500
I was given exactly 1 hour
to light up this song sequence

1965
01:54:36,540 --> 01:54:37,830
Yes, over there

1966
01:54:37,880 --> 01:54:41,960
When Rama Rao sir is in the scene
who will look at the moon or a string?!

1967
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:45,960
"Smart and shrewd as ruler fair"

1968
01:54:46,630 --> 01:54:49,830
"Aware of all the tricks in warfare"

1969
01:54:51,380 --> 01:54:56,330
"Smart and shrewd as ruler fair
Aware of all the tricks in warfare"

1970
01:54:56,380 --> 01:54:59,670
"In my heart so flustered
Lord of love seated undeterred"

1971
01:54:59,750 --> 01:55:02,080
"In the blink of an eye...ethereal"

1972
01:55:02,130 --> 01:55:04,170
"Phenomenal"

1973
01:55:06,250 --> 01:55:09,710
"However powerful a king you may be"

1974
01:55:11,380 --> 01:55:14,000
"You can be a king mighty"

1975
01:55:14,040 --> 01:55:16,920
"Sometime in solitude for a while"

1976
01:55:18,920 --> 01:55:22,750
"Thinking of his lady-love with a smile"

1977
01:55:22,790 --> 01:55:24,830
"Miracle of creation"

1978
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:27,580
"A feat beyond expectation"

1979
01:55:27,670 --> 01:55:30,830
"Sublime soul satisfaction!"

1980
01:55:32,170 --> 01:55:35,880
"With Hanuman on my flag as my mascot"

1981
01:55:36,040 --> 01:55:38,790
"With steady steed in front that trot"

1982
01:55:40,330 --> 01:55:41,880
Brother-in-law

1983
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:44,920
Your wife is here
Will you stop for 2 minutes please?

1984
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:46,380
Namaste, madam

1985
01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:53,080
3 days since you came home

1986
01:55:53,210 --> 01:55:55,710
'3 months since you ate at home!'

1987
01:55:55,750 --> 01:56:00,290
Forgetting food and basic comforts
why this struggle and starvation, dear?

1988
01:56:00,380 --> 01:56:02,040
Mad woman!

1989
01:56:02,080 --> 01:56:05,290
Compared to the satisfaction of
a new creation for future generation

1990
01:56:05,330 --> 01:56:06,710
...how can this be burdensome?

1991
01:56:06,750 --> 01:56:09,000
Why take on so much
at this age?

1992
01:56:10,540 --> 01:56:12,460
What if something happens to you?

1993
01:56:12,540 --> 01:56:16,000
Even after I die, I will be alive
as the evergreen hero on silver screen

1994
01:56:16,040 --> 01:56:17,170
My dear!

1995
01:56:19,080 --> 01:56:22,170
Editor sir, will you also
behave like this at home?

1996
01:56:22,210 --> 01:56:24,960
I will not get such an opportunity
This is my last cinema

1997
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:28,380
Mr Joshi
What are you saying?

1998
01:56:29,170 --> 01:56:32,380
In 30 years I have edited 1000 films

1999
01:56:32,500 --> 01:56:34,250
I will never get such an opportunity

2000
01:56:34,290 --> 01:56:37,830
I want to edit this film
and retire gracefully

2001
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:41,790
Such a film will never be repeated
with 1 actor donning 3 roles

2002
01:56:42,250 --> 01:56:44,750
He has donned the caps
of producer and director

2003
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:47,080
Krishna, Karna, Duryodhana

2004
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,330
'Daana Veera Soora Karna'

2005
01:56:50,380 --> 01:56:54,330
'Rama Rao 'garu', you have created a masterpiece
in 43 days the world will revere'

2006
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:00,580
'Guruji'

2007
01:57:02,750 --> 01:57:04,580
'What did you say?'

2008
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:08,380
'Are you rejecting him on the basis of
his caste as a charioteer's son?'

2009
01:57:08,540 --> 01:57:11,210
'How can you accuse like this?'

2010
01:57:19,670 --> 01:57:21,000
'My brother Duschasana'

2011
01:57:21,080 --> 01:57:24,080
'Fetch the crown studded
with precious gems'

2012
01:57:24,130 --> 01:57:26,080
'Uncle, king of Gandhara'

2013
01:57:26,130 --> 01:57:29,000
'Fetch a golden throne
with the most intricate carving'

2014
01:57:29,130 --> 01:57:32,580
'My dear subjects, receive the blessings
of the sacred Bhagirathi river'

2015
01:57:32,630 --> 01:57:36,330
'Musicians, sing in your dulcet voices
accompanied by auspicious instruments'

2016
01:57:36,380 --> 01:57:39,960
'Royal ushers, get Karna ready'

2017
01:57:40,040 --> 01:57:41,130
'Women verily blessed'

2018
01:57:41,170 --> 01:57:46,330
'To be a just and good king to his subjects
as pure as his golden earring and armor'

2019
01:57:46,380 --> 01:57:51,380
'Apply sandalwood paste on him
to spread the fragrance of the new rule'

2020
01:57:51,540 --> 01:57:55,000
'Under the auspices of my subjects
supervised by our expert priests'

2021
01:57:55,040 --> 01:57:57,960
'Auspiciousness always and in all ways'

2022
01:57:57,960 --> 01:58:02,380
'I purify his lineage and remove
all blemishes smeared on him'

2023
01:58:06,380 --> 01:58:08,920
Janardhan, when will we
reach our location?

2024
01:58:08,960 --> 01:58:10,960
We will reach Madhumalai
in half an hour, sir

2025
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,330
Then drive through
forest area for 90 minutes

2026
01:58:14,670 --> 01:58:16,290
Is Nagabushanam coming there?

2027
01:58:16,330 --> 01:58:17,500
Day after tomorrow, sir

2028
01:58:17,540 --> 01:58:21,000
We have planned a song with
Jayasudha and Jayapradha combination

2029
01:58:21,130 --> 01:58:23,330
How can you call them by their names?

2030
01:58:23,380 --> 01:58:25,830
Jayasudha madam
Jayapradha madam

2031
01:58:25,880 --> 01:58:27,960
Did you snip their umbilical cord
and name them?

2032
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:29,670
Sorry, sir
My mistake

2033
01:58:35,380 --> 01:58:37,170
To watch our 'Adavi Ramudu'

2034
01:58:37,210 --> 01:58:39,080
Sorry, 'Adavi Ramudu sir'

2035
01:58:39,130 --> 01:58:40,880
Expectation is really high, sir

2036
01:58:40,920 --> 01:58:43,380
Why refer to the title with respect,
you stupid donkey!

2037
01:58:44,380 --> 01:58:46,500
You act over-smart
I will skin you alive

2038
01:58:46,540 --> 01:58:47,880
Sorry

2039
01:58:54,380 --> 01:58:57,330
My guruji's hermitage
is somewhere on this route

2040
01:58:57,380 --> 01:58:59,080
Who is your guruji, brother?

2041
01:58:59,380 --> 01:59:01,670
Sree Saila Jagadhguru Swami

2042
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:03,500
Seer with divine attributes

2043
01:59:15,750 --> 01:59:18,830
Rama Rao sir, guruji is observing
his vow of silence now

2044
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:21,080
He will not talk to anyone
or bless anyone

2045
01:59:21,250 --> 01:59:24,130
I do not mind, I will take
his blessings from a distance

2046
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:58,540
Jewel in the crown in entertainment field
Your name and fame has spread worldwide

2047
01:59:58,580 --> 02:00:00,920
Nandamuri Tarakarama!

2048
02:00:06,540 --> 02:00:08,130
I am so fortunate

2049
02:00:08,380 --> 02:00:10,290
I came just to see a glimpse of you

2050
02:00:10,330 --> 02:00:12,250
I feel cherished with
your blessings now

2051
02:00:12,290 --> 02:00:13,960
This entire universe

2052
02:00:14,540 --> 02:00:16,880
...will bless you, my son

2053
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,830
Will you eat with me?

2054
02:00:23,750 --> 02:00:24,960
My pleasure

2055
02:00:29,830 --> 02:00:33,040
Food is a sacred gift from God, Rama Rao

2056
02:00:44,130 --> 02:00:45,540
I will take leave, swami

2057
02:00:45,580 --> 02:00:47,380
May you be victorious

2058
02:00:52,960 --> 02:00:57,630
Swami, seeing him
you broke your vow of silence

2059
02:00:57,830 --> 02:01:02,080
You never let anyone touch you
But you embraced him and blessed him

2060
02:01:02,170 --> 02:01:04,000
May I know the reason, swami?

2061
02:01:05,380 --> 02:01:10,790
He is a fortunate soul
blessed by Lord Shiva

2062
02:01:11,500 --> 02:01:18,710
I wonder how many people are aware
of our epics and historical events

2063
02:01:18,830 --> 02:01:24,540
But in Andhra Pradesh he is the sole reason
our people are aware of our classics

2064
02:01:25,380 --> 02:01:27,080
He is destiny's child

2065
02:01:29,040 --> 02:01:33,960
He is unparalleled king
of our silver screen

2066
02:01:36,040 --> 02:01:40,330
He is the controller and guide to minds
and emotions of the future generation

2067
02:01:41,380 --> 02:01:46,580
"When born as a human being
a mere clay doll (s)he cannot be"

2068
02:01:46,670 --> 02:01:49,670
[song from 'Adavi Ramudu']

2069
02:01:49,710 --> 02:01:56,330
"If he is stubborn single-mindedly
another Brahma he can be"

2070
02:01:58,880 --> 02:02:03,130
"With hard work and sincerity
men can become seers saintly"

2071
02:02:03,170 --> 02:02:06,380
"They can become noble soles easily"

2072
02:02:07,630 --> 02:02:11,920
"For generations to come they will be
a beacon of light extra ordinary"

2073
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,580
"Worshiped for eternity duly"

2074
02:02:17,880 --> 02:02:20,460
Mr Narasaraju, dialogs are all fine

2075
02:02:20,670 --> 02:02:22,250
Really humorous

2076
02:02:23,790 --> 02:02:27,380
But in the film 'Yamagola'
Emergency chaos should be obvious

2077
02:02:28,170 --> 02:02:30,670
This Emergency is at
its peak of autocracy

2078
02:02:31,750 --> 02:02:33,170
Let us criticize it vehemently

2079
02:02:33,210 --> 02:02:35,080
In such an entertaining subject

2080
02:02:35,130 --> 02:02:38,170
...will a serious episode
like Emergency fit in?

2081
02:02:38,420 --> 02:02:40,880
Mr Tatineni, why will we
convey it seriously?

2082
02:02:40,920 --> 02:02:42,170
It should be on a sarcastic note

2083
02:02:42,210 --> 02:02:44,540
Even Yama will listen
when a leader says it

2084
02:02:44,670 --> 02:02:45,710
Leave it to me now

2085
02:02:45,750 --> 02:02:48,080
You know the forced
sterilisation program?

2086
02:02:48,130 --> 02:02:49,210
That is good enough

2087
02:02:49,250 --> 02:02:50,830
Sounds good
Go ahead

2088
02:02:50,880 --> 02:02:52,960
'I am a Govt employee
with wife and children'

2089
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,170
'I had a quota
for the surgeries'

2090
02:02:55,210 --> 02:02:58,750
'Unless I meet my target
I will not be paid, so I complied'

2091
02:02:59,170 --> 02:03:01,210
'That is all, sir
Please note this point'

2092
02:03:01,250 --> 02:03:03,130
'- On whose orders?
- Govt'

2093
02:03:03,170 --> 02:03:04,460
'Not the Govt, sir'

2094
02:03:04,500 --> 02:03:06,290
'Without any official authority'

2095
02:03:06,330 --> 02:03:09,170
'...a youth leader controls the Govt'

2096
02:03:09,170 --> 02:03:10,210
Cut

2097
02:03:10,250 --> 02:03:12,130
Rama Rao sir
Good, very good

2098
02:03:12,170 --> 02:03:14,210
We are referring to
the PM's son directly

2099
02:03:14,250 --> 02:03:15,500
Is it not dangerous?

2100
02:03:15,710 --> 02:03:18,750
Venkatratnam sir, he wanted me
to target the prime minister

2101
02:03:18,790 --> 02:03:20,960
I was the one
who restricted it to the son

2102
02:03:21,330 --> 02:03:26,250
"My dear lassie petite
if I peck you like a parakeet"

2103
02:03:26,420 --> 02:03:30,670
'You cannot bear my advances
my beloved princess"

2104
02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:36,130
"My dear lassie petite
if I peck you like a parakeet"

2105
02:03:36,170 --> 02:03:39,130
[song from 'Yamagola']

2106
02:03:41,170 --> 02:03:45,250
"You crossed your limit, naughty rogue"

2107
02:03:46,130 --> 02:03:50,210
"Stop teasing me, you wicked bloke"

2108
02:03:50,420 --> 02:03:55,380
"Enough of your rowdy behavior
my dear prancing prankster"

2109
02:03:55,420 --> 02:04:00,920
"My dear lassie petite
if I peck you like a parakeet"

2110
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:05,130
"You cannot bear my advances
my beloved princess"

2111
02:04:05,170 --> 02:04:06,960
- Song is enticing
- Of course

2112
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:10,130
But seeing how the women
in our family react, I am apprehensive

2113
02:04:10,170 --> 02:04:13,710
No doubt at all, it is a super hit
I will watch it again for sure

2114
02:04:15,960 --> 02:04:18,420
"Have you lost control, dear?"

2115
02:04:19,170 --> 02:04:20,250
Wait

2116
02:04:20,790 --> 02:04:23,040
Tell me, how is my 'Yamagola'?

2117
02:04:24,420 --> 02:04:26,130
No one is voicing any opinion?

2118
02:04:26,170 --> 02:04:27,170
You did not like it?

2119
02:04:27,290 --> 02:04:30,330
That stupid parrot song
with that young heroine?

2120
02:04:30,420 --> 02:04:31,710
What was that silly dance?

2121
02:04:31,750 --> 02:04:33,500
Not good, Lokamma?

2122
02:04:33,790 --> 02:04:36,880
Jayapradha must be
younger than me, father

2123
02:04:37,040 --> 02:04:38,420
With her as your pair-

2124
02:04:39,170 --> 02:04:42,130
I am a youngster too
I am just 25 years old in the film

2125
02:04:42,170 --> 02:04:45,420
Then you can carry a book
and go to college too

2126
02:04:46,040 --> 02:04:48,790
If my role demanded that
I would do even that

2127
02:04:48,830 --> 02:04:49,830
What, brother?

2128
02:04:49,880 --> 02:04:52,290
Take the example of Nageswara Rao sir

2129
02:04:52,330 --> 02:04:56,170
Not wanting to reveal his age
he buttons up his shirt very high

2130
02:04:56,330 --> 02:04:58,500
While you show off
4 buttons down

2131
02:04:58,790 --> 02:05:01,170
I do not know if the audience will watch

2132
02:05:01,170 --> 02:05:04,330
Taking extra care is brother's style
Being carefree is my style

2133
02:05:04,380 --> 02:05:06,080
Tarakam, what do you say?

2134
02:05:12,750 --> 02:05:14,130
Actually, brother-in-law

2135
02:05:14,170 --> 02:05:17,170
This touching and teasing
Intertwining feet, all these steps

2136
02:05:17,170 --> 02:05:19,250
Crossing limits of decency

2137
02:05:19,290 --> 02:05:22,040
I think my sister thinks that
Do not feel bad about it

2138
02:05:22,080 --> 02:05:26,080
"You crossed your limit, naughty rogue"
If these are the words what can I do?

2139
02:05:26,210 --> 02:05:27,460
In 'Chandragupta'

2140
02:05:27,500 --> 02:05:29,460
"In the youthful drizzle of your smile"

2141
02:05:29,500 --> 02:05:32,130
Did I not act refined
without touching the heroine?

2142
02:05:32,170 --> 02:05:33,170
Of course, you did

2143
02:05:33,170 --> 02:05:35,710
From song to song, role to role
there will be variations

2144
02:05:35,750 --> 02:05:36,790
I agree

2145
02:05:36,830 --> 02:05:40,250
We must change with the times
Only then people will listen to me

2146
02:05:40,380 --> 02:05:43,210
Wait and watch, this film
will become a sensation

2147
02:05:43,250 --> 02:05:45,290
This will inspire
many more films to follow

2148
02:05:45,330 --> 02:05:47,420
Indeed, yes
brother-in-law

2149
02:05:47,500 --> 02:05:48,540
It should inspire!

2150
02:05:48,670 --> 02:05:50,170
'Cyclone in Diviseema'

2151
02:05:50,170 --> 02:05:53,920
'It is reported to be the most
devastating cyclone of this century'

2152
02:05:53,960 --> 02:05:55,130
'Diviseema was wiped out'

2153
02:05:55,170 --> 02:05:57,540
Cyclone, brother-in-law
It will only get worse

2154
02:05:57,670 --> 02:05:59,670
If you are planning
to shoot, cancel it

2155
02:06:02,670 --> 02:06:05,290
Whether I try to call
Nimmakkuru or Komaravolu

2156
02:06:05,330 --> 02:06:07,210
I am unable to
reach anyone, uncle

2157
02:06:07,920 --> 02:06:09,790
Cyclone is really severe it seems

2158
02:06:10,830 --> 02:06:13,790
We are in Madras

2159
02:06:13,830 --> 02:06:16,000
Our friends and family are over there

2160
02:06:16,210 --> 02:06:18,040
I am scared, uncle

2161
02:06:20,130 --> 02:06:21,130
Oh god!

2162
02:06:21,500 --> 02:06:23,500
Electric poles have fallen down?

2163
02:06:24,170 --> 02:06:27,000
How about the poor people
living in the huts there?

2164
02:06:28,960 --> 02:06:30,080
Dead, huh?

2165
02:06:33,040 --> 02:06:34,960
What are you saying, uncle?

2166
02:06:35,080 --> 02:06:36,670
How are our people now?

2167
02:06:37,420 --> 02:06:40,130
Find out about the neighboring
towns and villages?

2168
02:06:40,170 --> 02:06:43,210
My husband wants to know
the status of towns nearby?

2169
02:06:44,210 --> 02:06:47,330
'It is ravaging one town
after another, huh?'

2170
02:06:48,130 --> 02:06:50,040
'Taken a toll on so many lives?'

2171
02:07:02,170 --> 02:07:05,750
Petrified of floods,
people are huddled to one side

2172
02:07:05,790 --> 02:07:08,000
Oblivious of the sea on the other side

2173
02:07:08,040 --> 02:07:10,250
...many were swept away by the waves

2174
02:07:10,290 --> 02:07:13,540
'Out of 900 people in that village
only 3 have survived'

2175
02:07:21,420 --> 02:07:25,130
"Hero of the silver screen"

2176
02:07:26,170 --> 02:07:29,670
"Film hero evergreen"

2177
02:07:34,790 --> 02:07:42,080
"VIP with a face to please
Listen to our pitiful pleas"

2178
02:07:43,250 --> 02:07:50,830
"Super star celebrity
Listen to our tearful plea"

2179
02:07:53,880 --> 02:08:01,790
"Water turned into a curse as tsunami
Our dreams washed to embers suddenly"

2180
02:08:01,830 --> 02:08:11,170
"Our walls crumbled before dawn break
Our lives we are forced to forsake"

2181
02:08:11,250 --> 02:08:14,380
"Oh my Lord!"

2182
02:08:43,170 --> 02:08:45,420
Our son is missing

2183
02:08:46,170 --> 02:08:48,210
I am sure he is dead

2184
02:08:48,790 --> 02:08:51,290
You cannot anyway bring him back alive

2185
02:08:52,170 --> 02:08:54,920
At least bring his body

2186
02:08:55,130 --> 02:08:57,290
We would like to see him

2187
02:08:57,330 --> 02:09:01,920
Cyclone has hit 83 villages
and turned them into graveyards

2188
02:09:02,170 --> 02:09:05,920
Look! Lord Venugopal's temple
situated in the village of Hamsaladeevi

2189
02:09:05,960 --> 02:09:08,710
The water rose right up to the temple tower

2190
02:09:08,790 --> 02:09:12,830
Only 100 people who took shelter
in the sanctum survived

2191
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:14,210
Brother?

2192
02:09:16,540 --> 02:09:18,290
Greetings, Mr Krishna Rao

2193
02:09:19,830 --> 02:09:26,290
"Wish we could count the corpses countless"

2194
02:09:26,380 --> 02:09:33,790
"We pray to deities endless
offering vows limitless"

2195
02:09:36,080 --> 02:09:42,540
"Breathless with fear; en masse
Unable to breathe our last"

2196
02:09:42,670 --> 02:09:48,830
"Tears of the survivors streaming
Bursting as deluge, grief screaming"

2197
02:09:52,460 --> 02:09:55,420
"Mother, you have survived
coped with this disaster?"

2198
02:09:55,710 --> 02:09:58,960
"Is your son safe from the deluge of water?"

2199
02:09:59,080 --> 02:10:05,460
"Diviseema is erased
from the earth's face"

2200
02:10:05,540 --> 02:10:12,130
"Court of Vijayanagar long ago lauded
Diviseema poets for their talent exalted"

2201
02:10:12,170 --> 02:10:18,250
"All we want somehow
a handful of rice now"

2202
02:10:26,170 --> 02:10:28,290
My heart seems to explode in agony

2203
02:10:35,500 --> 02:10:42,670
"Telugu Super star please
Listen to our anguished pleas"

2204
02:10:42,750 --> 02:10:45,290
People who elevated us
to such lofty heights

2205
02:10:46,170 --> 02:10:48,920
Are now far away from food
and their near & dear ones

2206
02:10:52,460 --> 02:10:53,920
Tell me, brother

2207
02:10:54,670 --> 02:10:56,000
What shall we do?

2208
02:10:57,040 --> 02:10:59,250
Earlier for the sake of
Rayalaseema drought relief

2209
02:10:59,290 --> 02:11:01,420
...our film industry collected
a sizeable amount

2210
02:11:01,460 --> 02:11:04,170
Our industry collected donations
for our brave soldiers

2211
02:11:04,290 --> 02:11:06,040
We have always
risen to the occasion

2212
02:11:06,080 --> 02:11:08,170
This time too we will do the needful

2213
02:11:08,540 --> 02:11:12,040
Inspired in the same manner
we head towards Diviseema now

2214
02:11:15,250 --> 02:11:16,500
Namaste

2215
02:11:17,460 --> 02:11:19,540
If this NTR ANR Welfare Fund

2216
02:11:20,170 --> 02:11:23,540
...can wipe away even a few tears,
we have achieved our goal

2217
02:11:24,290 --> 02:11:28,000
We presume you will help us
and we are banking on you

2218
02:11:28,170 --> 02:11:29,750
Sister-in-law is not here, brother?

2219
02:11:29,830 --> 02:11:31,420
I will make the 1st contribution

2220
02:11:32,170 --> 02:11:34,500
That is wonderful
Please do, brother

2221
02:11:45,330 --> 02:11:47,210
- Brother
- Yes, Chellamma

2222
02:11:47,250 --> 02:11:49,750
- What will you give me?
- 1 minute, brother

2223
02:11:51,420 --> 02:11:55,460
Help in whatever way you can
to the victims of the flood

2224
02:11:56,880 --> 02:11:59,880
Brother, did you really
drink liquor in 'Prem Nagar'?

2225
02:11:59,920 --> 02:12:02,080
All that is part of acting

2226
02:12:02,330 --> 02:12:04,460
Do I look like an alcoholic to you?

2227
02:12:04,670 --> 02:12:09,380
Did I not tell you, our Balaraju
is a man with a golden heart?

2228
02:12:10,670 --> 02:12:12,000
Bless you, my dear

2229
02:12:12,040 --> 02:12:13,290
Brother?

2230
02:12:15,960 --> 02:12:17,250
Your wedding chain

2231
02:12:17,330 --> 02:12:21,170
This sacred thread is as good as
a gold wedding chain, brother

2232
02:12:21,210 --> 02:12:25,210
This gold chain may save so many women
from not becoming widows!

2233
02:12:25,330 --> 02:12:28,080
You have a heart of gold
Bless you, dear

2234
02:12:32,080 --> 02:12:33,880
Thank you
I take leave

2235
02:12:45,540 --> 02:12:47,670
- Namaste, Mr Rama Rao
- Namaste

2236
02:12:47,880 --> 02:12:48,920
What happened?

2237
02:12:48,960 --> 02:12:50,330
Fever
104°

2238
02:12:50,380 --> 02:12:53,750
He has undergone a heart surgery, right?
He should not strain too much

2239
02:12:53,830 --> 02:12:56,040
I have prescribed medicines
He will be alright

2240
02:12:59,330 --> 02:13:01,000
Do not worry, brother

2241
02:13:01,670 --> 02:13:03,500
My heart will listen to me

2242
02:13:04,920 --> 02:13:07,460
It will continue to beat
till I ask it to stop

2243
02:13:07,500 --> 02:13:09,000
You need to be healthy

2244
02:13:09,040 --> 02:13:11,500
We must continue to share
this healthy competition

2245
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:14,960
Even if our hearts stop beating

2246
02:13:15,540 --> 02:13:18,170
...our cinema will still be
fresh in people's minds

2247
02:13:18,420 --> 02:13:19,960
And continue to compete

2248
02:13:21,460 --> 02:13:24,000
Please go to Vijayawada
I will handle this crisis here

2249
02:13:24,080 --> 02:13:25,670
It is alright
I will remain with you

2250
02:13:25,710 --> 02:13:28,960
Nageswara Rao sir, rest is
the medicine you need

2251
02:13:29,040 --> 02:13:30,460
Do not strain yourself now

2252
02:13:30,920 --> 02:13:32,170
Go home, brother

2253
02:13:36,380 --> 02:13:38,380
Get well soon, brother

2254
02:13:38,420 --> 02:13:41,040
Brother...brother

2255
02:13:41,330 --> 02:13:42,750
Brother!

2256
02:13:43,170 --> 02:13:45,250
'NTR Long live!'

2257
02:13:46,830 --> 02:13:49,000
'Long live NTR'

2258
02:13:49,040 --> 02:13:50,670
I need to speak to brother

2259
02:13:50,710 --> 02:13:53,170
Brother...brother
I want to talk to him

2260
02:13:53,210 --> 02:13:56,040
Brother, allow me inside

2261
02:13:56,080 --> 02:13:57,380
Brother...brother

2262
02:13:58,170 --> 02:14:00,750
Brother, my mother is very old

2263
02:14:00,830 --> 02:14:04,500
She is so anxious to meet you once
before she passes over

2264
02:14:04,540 --> 02:14:07,750
She is in her death bed
She cannot travel, brother

2265
02:14:07,830 --> 02:14:10,170
Brother, can you come over please?

2266
02:14:10,170 --> 02:14:12,170
Please say 'yes'

2267
02:14:12,210 --> 02:14:14,130
Brother, I beg of you

2268
02:14:14,170 --> 02:14:15,750
Hey! Leave her alone

2269
02:14:15,880 --> 02:14:20,290
Brother, will you visit my mother?

2270
02:14:21,290 --> 02:14:22,540
Where is your house?

2271
02:14:23,540 --> 02:14:25,420
'Namaste'

2272
02:14:27,290 --> 02:14:28,540
'Greetings'

2273
02:14:28,750 --> 02:14:30,250
'Are you being well?'

2274
02:14:31,920 --> 02:14:33,170
'How are you?'

2275
02:14:33,460 --> 02:14:34,500
'Welcome, brother'

2276
02:14:34,540 --> 02:14:36,580
Grandma, look who has come

2277
02:14:39,750 --> 02:14:41,080
Look who is here

2278
02:14:41,130 --> 02:14:42,920
Ah! Ramudu

2279
02:14:42,960 --> 02:14:44,500
Rama sir, is that you?

2280
02:14:44,540 --> 02:14:46,330
Welcome to my humble dwelling

2281
02:14:46,380 --> 02:14:47,710
Rama the God!

2282
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,750
My dear child
Look at our special guest

2283
02:14:51,170 --> 02:14:53,130
Daily I see you

2284
02:14:53,170 --> 02:14:54,960
Are you not in that photo?

2285
02:15:01,170 --> 02:15:03,500
'Sir, what can I offer you?'

2286
02:15:03,880 --> 02:15:07,130
We do not even have
a handful of rice at home

2287
02:15:07,170 --> 02:15:09,920
Rama sir, can I offer you
our millet porridge?

2288
02:15:09,960 --> 02:15:11,330
Will you taste it?

2289
02:15:13,250 --> 02:15:15,540
Grandma, why do we eat
ragi porridge daily?

2290
02:15:15,670 --> 02:15:17,170
Why can we not eat rice?

2291
02:15:17,210 --> 02:15:18,670
Do you want to eat rice?

2292
02:15:18,750 --> 02:15:23,960
If you want to eat rice everyday
the God we pray to has to come down

2293
02:15:29,670 --> 02:15:32,460
Let me feed you,
my precious son

2294
02:15:33,170 --> 02:15:35,250
Have one more handful
my dear child

2295
02:15:35,290 --> 02:15:36,830
Enough, ma

2296
02:15:37,460 --> 02:15:39,170
Handful of rice served with love

2297
02:15:39,500 --> 02:15:41,460
...is equal to being fed
by my mother

2298
02:15:44,170 --> 02:15:46,210
'- Bless you my son
- Thank you, amma'

2299
02:15:46,290 --> 02:15:48,540
My lifelong dream has come true

2300
02:15:48,580 --> 02:15:50,170
'I will take leave, amma'

2301
02:15:54,960 --> 02:15:56,210
My younger brother

2302
02:15:56,250 --> 02:15:57,670
He reached God's feet

2303
02:15:58,130 --> 02:15:59,500
He combed his hair like you

2304
02:15:59,540 --> 02:16:01,130
And laughed like you

2305
02:16:01,170 --> 02:16:03,290
Formed unions and
instigated strikes

2306
02:16:03,330 --> 02:16:05,960
'He imitated your reel life
in his real life'

2307
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:07,920
He crossed the paths of big shots

2308
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,460
Is it possible to bring
a change in politics, brother?

2309
02:16:10,540 --> 02:16:12,170
How can our life be a cinema?

2310
02:16:12,500 --> 02:16:13,670
Society

2311
02:16:13,880 --> 02:16:15,250
Killed him

2312
02:16:40,670 --> 02:16:43,080
Seeking donations for Rayalaseema

2313
02:16:43,130 --> 02:16:46,130
...you trudged the streets of our state

2314
02:16:46,500 --> 02:16:50,460
Today you are here for Diviseema
acquainting yourself with us so freely

2315
02:16:50,500 --> 02:16:51,880
Ramaiya

2316
02:16:52,290 --> 02:16:54,250
What you are holding
is not a begging bowl

2317
02:16:54,330 --> 02:16:57,750
But a pot of rice
Here, give it to them

2318
02:16:57,830 --> 02:17:01,170
- Is it not for our Lord in Tirupati?
- This is also for God

2319
02:17:01,170 --> 02:17:04,880
Anyone who serves the people
is our Lord in Tirupati in human form

2320
02:17:05,130 --> 02:17:06,880
Please accept this

2321
02:17:12,330 --> 02:17:15,250
'Glory to Pathala Bhairavi!
Glory to NTR'

2322
02:17:15,540 --> 02:17:18,170
'Praise be to NTR'

2323
02:17:18,790 --> 02:17:23,170
He is Mr Mohan Kanda, officer in charge
of constructing houses in Diviseema

2324
02:17:23,170 --> 02:17:24,920
Namaste

2325
02:17:25,170 --> 02:17:26,380
Brother

2326
02:17:28,170 --> 02:17:29,290
Please accept it

2327
02:17:29,330 --> 02:17:33,710
Like a squirrel, our cinema industry
has collected a sum of 13 lakhs

2328
02:17:34,130 --> 02:17:36,130
This contains details of the donation

2329
02:17:36,170 --> 02:17:38,170
Govt announced
a relief fund of 10 lakhs

2330
02:17:38,210 --> 02:17:40,210
You have both collected 13 lakhs

2331
02:17:40,250 --> 02:17:41,880
With this amount

2332
02:17:41,920 --> 02:17:45,460
...in the name of cinema industry
proper houses will be built in each village

2333
02:17:45,500 --> 02:17:49,130
Ramakrishna Mission will take up
this responsibility, thank you

2334
02:17:50,210 --> 02:17:51,790
Do you recognise me?

2335
02:17:52,710 --> 02:17:55,040
- Are you Telugu?
- Not just that

2336
02:17:55,130 --> 02:17:57,420
I was a child artiste
in 'Pelli Chesi Choodu'

2337
02:17:57,460 --> 02:18:00,880
When you played the harmonium
for the "Pelli Chesukone" song

2338
02:18:00,920 --> 02:18:03,460
...I was the young boy
prancing in the background

2339
02:18:03,500 --> 02:18:05,170
Oho! Wonderful

2340
02:18:05,290 --> 02:18:09,540
I am so glad to see that mischievous boy
as a dutiful officer now, brother

2341
02:18:10,170 --> 02:18:11,920
That day is crystal clear in my mind

2342
02:18:11,960 --> 02:18:15,040
Your wife taught you
to play the harmonium

2343
02:18:15,210 --> 02:18:17,380
You called me aside and told me

2344
02:18:17,460 --> 02:18:20,210
'Cinema can come later
1st focus on your studies'

2345
02:18:21,170 --> 02:18:23,540
- We are proud of you, Mr Mohan Kanda
- Thank you, sir

2346
02:18:23,580 --> 02:18:26,380
Anyway everything will go
right as rain for our brother

2347
02:18:32,880 --> 02:18:34,250
1...2...!

2348
02:18:34,710 --> 02:18:37,210
"Bud behind leaves got drenched unbidden"

2349
02:18:38,670 --> 02:18:41,540
"Flower amidst branches hidden
got wet all of a sudden"

2350
02:18:42,540 --> 02:18:46,380
"Bud behind leaves got wet excitedly
Flower amidst branches got wet elatedly"

2351
02:18:46,420 --> 02:18:49,920
"River Ganga flowed with agility
as a deluge soaked in her beauty"

2352
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:53,750
"Bubbly ripples in river Godavari
Knotted his 'dhoti' with her sari"

2353
02:18:53,830 --> 02:18:56,250
"The caged dove got wet too"

2354
02:18:57,670 --> 02:19:00,540
"Her heart's secret new
got wet through and through"

2355
02:19:01,380 --> 02:19:03,500
"Dove caged within
got drenched to the skin"

2356
02:19:03,540 --> 02:19:05,460
"Her soul's secret new
was soaked too"

2357
02:19:05,500 --> 02:19:08,960
"River Ganga flowed with agility
as a deluge soaked in her beauty"

2358
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:12,540
"Bubbly ripples in river Godavari
Knotted his 'dhoti' with her sari"

2359
02:19:12,630 --> 02:19:14,880
[song from 'Vetagadu']

2360
02:19:16,460 --> 02:19:20,000
Sister, look how brother-in-law looks
at Sridevi without taking his eyes off

2361
02:19:20,080 --> 02:19:22,080
Hari, keep quiet

2362
02:19:24,080 --> 02:19:27,500
To see you romancing with
a 16 year old girl in the rain

2363
02:19:27,580 --> 02:19:29,040
Really interesting

2364
02:19:31,670 --> 02:19:33,670
Sridevi looks so beautiful

2365
02:19:34,210 --> 02:19:36,710
Both of you make
a lovely pair, dear

2366
02:19:39,670 --> 02:19:41,080
What happened, dear?

2367
02:19:42,250 --> 02:19:44,920
Rain used to thrill me
so much all these years

2368
02:19:45,540 --> 02:19:49,250
But now rain only reminds me
of all those poor people's tears

2369
02:19:51,500 --> 02:19:53,830
Like how you fought the British

2370
02:19:53,880 --> 02:19:55,920
...similarly people who betray our country

2371
02:19:55,960 --> 02:19:57,500
...should be stripped to their skin

2372
02:19:57,540 --> 02:20:01,040
Protect the future of
the land you were born in

2373
02:20:01,210 --> 02:20:04,830
'Whichever place may seem Heaven to you
your home is paradise' is your dialog

2374
02:20:04,880 --> 02:20:07,960
You will think of Mother India
for one last time

2375
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:09,710
And breathe your last

2376
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:11,830
We will freeze on your face

2377
02:20:12,380 --> 02:20:14,880
And my voice over
as the last dialog

2378
02:20:15,330 --> 02:20:16,670
End card will be displayed

2379
02:20:16,670 --> 02:20:17,670
Fantastic!

2380
02:20:18,540 --> 02:20:19,960
You narrated the story remarkably

2381
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:21,000
We will do this film

2382
02:20:21,040 --> 02:20:22,880
- Go ahead
- Thank you

2383
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,080
I should be the one
to thank you, Dasari sir

2384
02:20:26,210 --> 02:20:28,420
This is the right story
at the right time!

2385
02:20:28,670 --> 02:20:29,670
Thank you, sir

2386
02:20:29,710 --> 02:20:31,670
Really powerful title

2387
02:20:31,790 --> 02:20:33,420
'Sardar Papa Rayudu'

2388
02:20:35,460 --> 02:20:39,290
[from 'Sardar Papa Rayudu']

2389
02:20:41,040 --> 02:20:44,960
"Let the beat of drums true
echo the glory of Sitaramaraju"

2390
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:48,580
"One who kills foe with fervor
in the battlefield without fear and favor"

2391
02:20:48,630 --> 02:20:52,920
"He strides with a purpose anew
This man of substance Sitaramaraju"

2392
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:56,710
"One who kills his foes callously
in the battlefield whoever he may be"

2393
02:20:56,750 --> 02:21:00,670
"Powerful weapon held by Lord Rama
Most destructive Pashupatastra"

2394
02:21:00,670 --> 02:21:04,630
"One who kills foe any way
in the battlefield come what may"

2395
02:21:04,670 --> 02:21:08,670
"With a purposeful stride he passed by
like the blazing sun in the noon sky"

2396
02:21:08,670 --> 02:21:12,830
"One who kills foe with fervor
in the battlefield without fear and favor"

2397
02:21:14,080 --> 02:21:15,250
Cut

2398
02:21:19,920 --> 02:21:21,380
Mr Kranthi Kumar

2399
02:21:21,420 --> 02:21:23,830
How can you fall at my feet?

2400
02:21:23,960 --> 02:21:26,080
I cannot prevent myself
from doing so

2401
02:21:26,670 --> 02:21:29,000
I am Vinayaka Rao
Brother knows me very well

2402
02:21:29,040 --> 02:21:30,460
I just need 2 minutes with him

2403
02:21:30,500 --> 02:21:32,380
He is in his costume
He cannot see you

2404
02:21:32,420 --> 02:21:33,670
What is this, Dasari sir?

2405
02:21:33,670 --> 02:21:34,670
You too?

2406
02:21:34,710 --> 02:21:37,040
This is not Rama Rao's feet

2407
02:21:37,210 --> 02:21:39,540
But Alluri Sitarama Raju's feet

2408
02:21:40,540 --> 02:21:44,000
Even the shadow of a person who lives
for his people should be worshiped

2409
02:21:44,420 --> 02:21:45,880
Until now I was simply acting

2410
02:21:46,670 --> 02:21:48,250
Now I want to be true to life

2411
02:21:48,290 --> 02:21:49,500
'Mr Rama Rao'

2412
02:21:50,040 --> 02:21:52,080
- Greetings, sir
- Namaste, sir

2413
02:21:53,210 --> 02:21:54,710
Mr Dasari, can I meet them?

2414
02:21:54,750 --> 02:21:55,750
Certainly

2415
02:21:55,790 --> 02:21:59,880
'In this attire it feels like we are
seeing Alluri Sitarama Raju himself!'

2416
02:21:59,960 --> 02:22:02,960
'All of us are aware also
how much you love this character'

2417
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,380
Tell us if there is any news,
we will write it down

2418
02:22:05,420 --> 02:22:06,710
News...?

2419
02:22:07,790 --> 02:22:09,540
I am turning 60 soon

2420
02:22:09,580 --> 02:22:11,210
All these years I lived for myself

2421
02:22:11,500 --> 02:22:14,580
From now on I am planning
to serve the people

2422
02:22:15,630 --> 02:22:17,040
Serving people?

2423
02:22:23,420 --> 02:22:24,880
What is this?
So many bags?

2424
02:22:24,920 --> 02:22:26,710
30 bags of letters

2425
02:22:27,710 --> 02:22:32,080
Have you brought to my house
all the letters meant for entire Madras?

2426
02:22:33,710 --> 02:22:38,960
'When I went to the revenue officer
to get a Govt 'ration card' he insulted me'

2427
02:22:39,210 --> 02:22:42,580
'We are enslaved
to these merciless officers'

2428
02:22:46,380 --> 02:22:48,040
'They insulted Anjaiah'

2429
02:22:48,080 --> 02:22:50,040
'Even if he is the P.M's son...'

2430
02:22:50,080 --> 02:22:52,380
'...how can he deride
a chief minister like that?'

2431
02:22:56,330 --> 02:23:00,670
'Our baby was in breach position
and the Govt hospital denied medical aid'

2432
02:23:00,710 --> 02:23:03,420
'My baby died in my womb'

2433
02:23:03,460 --> 02:23:04,580
Father, coffee

2434
02:23:04,630 --> 02:23:06,670
'My womb turned out
to be his graveyard'

2435
02:23:06,670 --> 02:23:10,330
'We have no future ahead if we are
devoid of blessings from any God'

2436
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:23,380
Namaste

2437
02:23:23,420 --> 02:23:24,750
'Are you all doing fine?'

2438
02:23:25,500 --> 02:23:26,580
'Where is Babu?'

2439
02:23:29,080 --> 02:23:33,210
Hey, Babu, it seems your father-in-law
intends starting a political party?

2440
02:23:33,380 --> 02:23:34,460
I do not know

2441
02:23:34,790 --> 02:23:36,750
Are you lying to this Anjaiah?

2442
02:23:36,790 --> 02:23:38,920
As if he will decide
without telling you?

2443
02:23:38,960 --> 02:23:41,000
If I am marrying his daughter
he will consult me

2444
02:23:41,080 --> 02:23:43,330
Why will he tell me
if he is starting a party?

2445
02:23:43,380 --> 02:23:46,380
Is he entering politics or not?

2446
02:23:46,420 --> 02:23:49,670
Chief minister sir, do we not
know about Mr Rama Rao?

2447
02:23:49,710 --> 02:23:51,500
He will enter politics if he wants to

2448
02:23:51,540 --> 02:23:53,630
Before that, he will
inform us for sure

2449
02:23:53,670 --> 02:23:56,250
Sir, whatever the task
he will tell us before he starts

2450
02:23:56,290 --> 02:23:58,330
But he will not 'ask' us
what he should do!

2451
02:23:58,380 --> 02:24:00,540
Yes or no to politics
So be it!

2452
02:24:10,250 --> 02:24:11,960
- Who is that, brother-in-law?
- Who?

2453
02:24:12,080 --> 02:24:13,080
Who are you?

2454
02:24:13,130 --> 02:24:14,170
Wait, who are you?

2455
02:24:14,210 --> 02:24:16,460
- How can you barge in?
- Income tax department

2456
02:24:16,500 --> 02:24:17,750
We must check your accounts

2457
02:24:17,790 --> 02:24:19,080
All of you stay right here

2458
02:24:30,290 --> 02:24:32,790
Where is the remuneration details
for 'Super Man' cinema?

2459
02:24:32,830 --> 02:24:35,330
This is our record,
right from his 1st cinema

2460
02:24:42,670 --> 02:24:45,630
Give me the details of
your bank accounts also

2461
02:24:47,960 --> 02:24:49,960
Andhra Bank account #

2462
02:24:50,540 --> 02:24:51,880
06

2463
02:24:51,920 --> 02:24:53,290
Andhra Bank

2464
02:24:53,710 --> 02:24:55,880

2465
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:57,630
Indian Overseas Bank

IC2/8395

2469
02:25:04,460 --> 02:25:05,710
Correct, brother-in-law

2470
02:25:07,790 --> 02:25:10,630
Tarakam, make some tea for me

2471
02:25:10,670 --> 02:25:11,750
Serve them too

2472
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
They are doing their job

2473
02:25:18,170 --> 02:25:19,710
Carry on with your work

2474
02:25:20,040 --> 02:25:22,750
- Do you personally maintain accounts?
- It is all in order

2475
02:25:22,790 --> 02:25:24,500
We pay tax for every naya paise

2476
02:25:24,540 --> 02:25:27,670
Officer, if we do not file our tax
you will fine us and leave

2477
02:25:27,670 --> 02:25:29,920
But my brother-in-law will skin me alive!

2478
02:25:36,580 --> 02:25:37,710
Forgive us, Mr Rama Rao

2479
02:25:37,750 --> 02:25:41,000
Central office ordered us
to check your accounts

2480
02:25:41,250 --> 02:25:43,290
We have to do our duty, right?

2481
02:25:43,670 --> 02:25:45,460
Govt is like our mother

2482
02:25:45,670 --> 02:25:47,960
In every successful person's earnings...

2483
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:49,880
...his or her mother
has a rightful share

2484
02:25:49,920 --> 02:25:52,790
NTR is not interested
in his mother's share

2485
02:25:52,880 --> 02:25:55,210
Kindly convey this
to whoever sent you here

2486
02:25:58,250 --> 02:26:01,000
Madam, is sir entering politics?

2487
02:26:01,330 --> 02:26:03,330
I have no idea
Do you want him to?

2488
02:26:03,380 --> 02:26:05,580
If he enters politics,
will he still act in films?

2489
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,580
He will come here now
You can ask him yourself

2490
02:26:08,630 --> 02:26:09,880
Why should he enter politics?

2491
02:26:09,920 --> 02:26:11,710
Now flowers are being showered on him

2492
02:26:11,750 --> 02:26:14,580
'If he enters politics
people will fling stones at him'

2493
02:26:14,630 --> 02:26:16,040
'Leave him alone'

2494
02:26:17,790 --> 02:26:20,710
Mother, you go inside
I will take over

2495
02:26:24,830 --> 02:26:27,290
- Brother...brother
- Hey! Move aside

2496
02:26:27,380 --> 02:26:29,170
Move, why are you falling on him?

2497
02:26:29,210 --> 02:26:31,170
- Stop
- Hari

2498
02:26:31,880 --> 02:26:33,670
- Wait
- Alright, brother

2499
02:26:34,670 --> 02:26:35,710
How are you?

2500
02:26:35,750 --> 02:26:37,830
'Crops are not flourishing'

2501
02:26:37,880 --> 02:26:41,290
'Our husbands drink
in the Govt liquor bars'

2502
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,920
We are jobless
Our Govt is least bothered

2503
02:26:45,210 --> 02:26:47,290
I have been starving
for the past 6 months

2504
02:26:47,330 --> 02:26:50,670
Sharing our sorrow with
our family deity and you, our God

2505
02:26:50,750 --> 02:26:53,250
'...we prayed in Tirupati
and came here to see you'

2506
02:26:53,750 --> 02:26:57,330
Brother, whichever side we turn to
we only see disease and distress

2507
02:26:57,380 --> 02:26:59,500
'There is not even 1 hospital
to cover 20 villages'

2508
02:26:59,540 --> 02:27:01,380
'We are leading the life of a corpse'

2509
02:27:11,040 --> 02:27:12,330
Naidu

2510
02:27:12,580 --> 02:27:16,040
Congratulations on becoming
the 8th Chief Minister, master

2511
02:27:18,500 --> 02:27:19,670
Come with me

2512
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,630
Your father-in-law and I
share a strong friendship

2513
02:27:23,670 --> 02:27:26,250
We studied together
at Guntur AC college

2514
02:27:26,290 --> 02:27:28,380
He has told me this too

2515
02:27:28,460 --> 02:27:31,460
He, Jaggayya, KVS Sarma
All of them got together

2516
02:27:31,630 --> 02:27:33,250
And staged dramas

2517
02:27:33,330 --> 02:27:36,290
Somehow I was insistent
I wanted to enter politics

2518
02:27:36,420 --> 02:27:38,670
So our paths went in different ways

2519
02:27:41,580 --> 02:27:42,750
Now

2520
02:27:43,580 --> 02:27:45,290
...I heard our ways are merging

2521
02:27:46,830 --> 02:27:48,500
For my swearing-in ceremony...

2522
02:27:48,540 --> 02:27:50,830
...it would be my pleasure
if my friend can join

2523
02:27:50,960 --> 02:27:52,830
Please find out if he can

2524
02:27:52,880 --> 02:27:54,670
I will invite him myself

2525
02:27:55,290 --> 02:27:56,670
I will check with him

2526
02:28:05,040 --> 02:28:08,670
'Praise be to NTR'

2527
02:28:09,790 --> 02:28:12,500
Mr Rama Rao, you came for
your friend's swearing-in ceremony

2528
02:28:12,540 --> 02:28:14,670
Similarly will you also enter politics?

2529
02:28:15,080 --> 02:28:18,670
I have come only to attend
my friend's swearing-in ceremony

2530
02:28:19,210 --> 02:28:21,710
Rajasekhara Reddy
from Pulivendula

2531
02:28:21,750 --> 02:28:23,790
- Namaste, sir
- 'My very good friend'

2532
02:28:23,830 --> 02:28:25,250
Your fan as well

2533
02:28:25,750 --> 02:28:27,670
I met you in Naidu's wedding

2534
02:28:28,290 --> 02:28:30,330
- Glad to meet you again
- Thanks, sir

2535
02:28:30,380 --> 02:28:31,420
Come

2536
02:28:31,670 --> 02:28:32,920
Mr Rama Rao

2537
02:28:34,790 --> 02:28:37,380
Emperor of the universe
in entertainment

2538
02:28:37,420 --> 02:28:38,790
N.T.Rama Rao!

2539
02:28:38,880 --> 02:28:42,040
Bhavanam Venkataram
Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh

2540
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:50,670
We have grown now

2541
02:28:50,670 --> 02:28:51,830
Not in age!

2542
02:28:51,880 --> 02:28:54,710
I have grown, made a mark
in films and you in politics

2543
02:28:58,420 --> 02:28:59,500
Jaya

2544
02:28:59,540 --> 02:29:01,210
'Namaste, brother
How are you?'

2545
02:29:01,250 --> 02:29:02,250
Namaste

2546
02:29:02,290 --> 02:29:04,330
- How are you?
- Very good, brother

2547
02:29:06,830 --> 02:29:09,920
I, Bhavanam Venkataram

2548
02:29:09,960 --> 02:29:13,670
...do solemnly and sincerely affirm

2549
02:29:13,830 --> 02:29:19,670
...to bear true allegiance
to the Govt of India

2550
02:29:19,750 --> 02:29:23,630
Why take an oath when a mere sneeze
can deprive him of power?

2551
02:29:24,460 --> 02:29:25,710
In 4 years...

2552
02:29:25,750 --> 02:29:27,540
...he is the 3rd chief minister!

2553
02:29:27,710 --> 02:29:30,420
As chief minister of Andhra Pradesh

2554
02:29:30,500 --> 02:29:34,210
In our Congress party
even the chief minister lacks security

2555
02:29:34,250 --> 02:29:36,830
Then how will people be secure?

2556
02:29:38,460 --> 02:29:39,830
Bhaskara Rao

2557
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:41,670
Nadendla Bhaskara Rao

2558
02:29:42,420 --> 02:29:43,670
Pleased to meet you

2559
02:29:46,040 --> 02:29:48,380
I watched your film
'Papa Rayudu' yesterday

2560
02:29:48,670 --> 02:29:51,630
I could glimpse the emotion
required in our Assembly

2561
02:29:53,420 --> 02:29:56,750
I heard you are also thinking
of entering politics

2562
02:29:57,250 --> 02:29:58,920
Not politics

2563
02:29:59,460 --> 02:30:01,500
But I am thinking of serving the people

2564
02:30:01,540 --> 02:30:04,500
'I take this oath
with God as witness'

2565
02:30:08,170 --> 02:30:10,210
When I read all those letters

2566
02:30:10,290 --> 02:30:12,540
When I listen to the anguish
of those poor souls

2567
02:30:12,580 --> 02:30:16,170
...there is a pain nudging my heart
Mr Ramoji Rao sir

2568
02:30:16,920 --> 02:30:18,210
Nudging pain!

2569
02:30:18,250 --> 02:30:20,750
That same ache
made me hold my pen

2570
02:30:21,380 --> 02:30:24,420
Kindled me to oppose Emergency rule

2571
02:30:24,460 --> 02:30:28,210
Is the present politics
worth all this pain?

2572
02:30:28,540 --> 02:30:32,420
'Everywhere I see injustice,
inability, prejudice'

2573
02:30:32,460 --> 02:30:33,920
'Servitude to the wealthy'

2574
02:30:34,290 --> 02:30:37,750
'Hard work of our Telugus
is being auctioned in Delhi!'

2575
02:30:38,040 --> 02:30:40,130
'Instead of being
elected through ballot box'

2576
02:30:40,170 --> 02:30:42,540
'CM's seat is decided
via pull and post box!'

2577
02:30:42,750 --> 02:30:45,790
'They function as mere
puppets on a string'

2578
02:30:46,380 --> 02:30:49,540
'11 years since the foundation stone
was laid for Vizag steel plant'

2579
02:30:49,710 --> 02:30:51,710
'Even the ground has not been cleared'

2580
02:30:52,170 --> 02:30:54,540
'3 yields a year is
usually Andhra's pride'

2581
02:30:54,630 --> 02:30:57,210
'Now the same land is affected by famine'

2582
02:30:57,500 --> 02:31:00,750
'Our Telugu community has become
irrelevant in our nation now'

2583
02:31:00,920 --> 02:31:04,670
'We have to reiterate our presence
in a loud voice for the nation to realize'

2584
02:31:06,540 --> 02:31:08,250
You have not had dinner

2585
02:31:09,460 --> 02:31:11,380
At least drink this glass of milk

2586
02:31:12,330 --> 02:31:13,830
In illiteracy...

2587
02:31:14,250 --> 02:31:16,170
...Andhra Pradesh tops the list!

2588
02:31:17,330 --> 02:31:18,710
In creating jobs...

2589
02:31:18,750 --> 02:31:20,290
...it occupies the last place!

2590
02:31:21,080 --> 02:31:22,330
This has to change

2591
02:31:22,880 --> 02:31:24,080
Drink this milk

2592
02:31:30,210 --> 02:31:32,290
Read from here till this page

2593
02:31:32,330 --> 02:31:34,330
Socialist, Capitalist, Communist

2594
02:31:34,380 --> 02:31:35,540
Potpourri

2595
02:31:35,630 --> 02:31:38,540
This is a radical
humanist philosophy

2596
02:31:38,540 --> 02:31:39,880
Thank you, Chelameswara Rao

2597
02:31:39,920 --> 02:31:42,500
I will send you few more books
with Venkateswara Rao

2598
02:31:42,540 --> 02:31:44,630
'Claiming to be
an exclusive fan of yours...'

2599
02:31:44,670 --> 02:31:46,580
...I will not reduce your level

2600
02:31:47,170 --> 02:31:49,630
If you touch people's lives...

2601
02:31:50,830 --> 02:31:53,040
...the entire youth will support you

2602
02:31:53,830 --> 02:31:56,380
It is not enough to just question
in a quest for justice

2603
02:31:56,420 --> 02:31:58,500
'People need a guide
to direct them too'

2604
02:31:59,380 --> 02:32:01,250
People will pay heed to your words

2605
02:32:03,380 --> 02:32:04,540
Let us meet

2606
02:32:07,250 --> 02:32:08,540
I will take leave, uncle

2607
02:32:09,170 --> 02:32:10,540
'See you, Rama Rao'

2608
02:32:17,580 --> 02:32:18,960
'Your name?'

2609
02:32:19,080 --> 02:32:20,540
'Bobbili Tiger!'

2610
02:32:21,330 --> 02:32:22,540
'Real name?'

2611
02:32:22,580 --> 02:32:24,540
'Bobbili Tiger'

2612
02:32:25,540 --> 02:32:28,330
'Prior to this when you were
summoned to the court...'

2613
02:32:28,380 --> 02:32:30,880
'...I remember you said
your name is Chakradhar'

2614
02:32:30,920 --> 02:32:34,330
'In those courts and
with those judgments...'

2615
02:32:34,380 --> 02:32:37,580
'...that Chakradhar died right then'

2616
02:32:38,830 --> 02:32:40,380
'Died as a human being?'

2617
02:32:40,420 --> 02:32:43,250
'Died mentally and in spirit'

2618
02:32:43,330 --> 02:32:44,420
'Reason being?'

2619
02:32:49,500 --> 02:32:53,380
'Unable to stand by and watch
the deterioration of this society'

2620
02:32:53,420 --> 02:32:55,540
'The degradation
none of us saw...'

2621
02:32:55,750 --> 02:32:57,540
'...did you alone witness it?'

2622
02:32:57,880 --> 02:33:01,250
'For people living near a sewage hole'

2623
02:33:03,460 --> 02:33:06,750
'...they will be able to digest
that stink in their system with ease'

2624
02:33:08,750 --> 02:33:13,540
'Only newcomers
unable to bear that stink'

2625
02:33:13,580 --> 02:33:15,210
'...will run away!'

2626
02:33:15,420 --> 02:33:17,540
'As a newcomer where did you come from?'

2627
02:33:19,460 --> 02:33:25,250
'From a place which upheld justice,
honesty, discipline, sacrifice and courage'

2628
02:33:25,290 --> 02:33:28,920
'As these values are non existent in
our society, you became Bobbili Tiger'

2629
02:33:29,130 --> 02:33:31,830
'Accept you killed people
according to your own wish'

2630
02:33:32,500 --> 02:33:34,540
'Not my whims and fancy'

2631
02:33:38,210 --> 02:33:41,210
'But people who tarnish
our nation's integrity'

2632
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:48,920
A new model in Fiat
is out in the market

2633
02:33:48,960 --> 02:33:50,540
- I will buy it this year
- Sure

2634
02:33:51,130 --> 02:33:52,170
Father

2635
02:33:52,170 --> 02:33:54,170
These are NTR estates extension plans

2636
02:33:54,210 --> 02:33:56,000
'If you can look at it once-'

2637
02:33:56,210 --> 02:33:58,420
Father, we need to buy
new equipment for the studio

2638
02:33:58,460 --> 02:33:59,460
Will you take a look?

2639
02:33:59,500 --> 02:34:01,790
Do not bring all this
to me anymore

2640
02:34:01,920 --> 02:34:03,130
Take care of it yourself

2641
02:34:04,290 --> 02:34:06,250
Are you getting into politics?

2642
02:34:06,920 --> 02:34:08,290
What is wrong if he does?

2643
02:34:08,330 --> 02:34:09,790
Nothing wrong

2644
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:11,130
But why should he?

2645
02:34:11,170 --> 02:34:12,460
Why not, uncle?

2646
02:34:13,880 --> 02:34:16,170
I thought 15 days in a month
you will serve the people

2647
02:34:16,210 --> 02:34:18,330
...while you continue to act

2648
02:34:18,420 --> 02:34:20,210
I never thought
you will quit all this

2649
02:34:20,250 --> 02:34:22,830
If you want to do good
you can be in any job

2650
02:34:23,290 --> 02:34:25,000
But if you aspire for a change-

2651
02:34:25,040 --> 02:34:26,710
Is politics the only answer?

2652
02:34:27,830 --> 02:34:29,540
Brother, that is a jungle

2653
02:34:30,170 --> 02:34:32,210
Infested with poisonous insects
and cruel beasts

2654
02:34:32,250 --> 02:34:33,880
So what?
My father is a lion

2655
02:34:33,920 --> 02:34:35,880
He should live in that jungle too

2656
02:34:37,960 --> 02:34:39,670
Holding your words as gospel

2657
02:34:39,710 --> 02:34:42,170
I endorsed every move of yours, brother

2658
02:34:42,290 --> 02:34:44,330
But if you are entering politics...

2659
02:34:44,380 --> 02:34:46,170
I will not follow you, brother

2660
02:35:06,250 --> 02:35:08,080
Namaste, Mr Ramoji Rao

2661
02:35:08,790 --> 02:35:09,880
Yes

2662
02:35:09,920 --> 02:35:11,960
I spoke with Nadendla Bhaskara Rao

2663
02:35:13,250 --> 02:35:16,170
I will be announcing tomorrow
in Hyderabad MLA Quarters

2664
02:35:18,170 --> 02:35:19,170
Alright

2665
02:35:20,960 --> 02:35:22,130
Yes, sir

2666
02:35:29,790 --> 02:35:31,170
One more time...

2667
02:35:31,250 --> 02:35:32,830
...think about it, dear

2668
02:35:33,210 --> 02:35:37,080
Tarakam, suppose we have Rs 75

2669
02:35:37,580 --> 02:35:40,170
All our necessities
are covered with Rs 60

2670
02:35:40,790 --> 02:35:42,880
What will we do
with the balance Rs 15?

2671
02:35:44,880 --> 02:35:47,170
Maximum I may live
up to 75 years of age

2672
02:35:48,170 --> 02:35:49,540
I will complete 60 soon

2673
02:35:50,130 --> 02:35:51,830
All our responsibilities are over

2674
02:35:52,460 --> 02:35:54,290
The remaining years of my life

2675
02:35:55,040 --> 02:35:57,000
...I want to share it with my people

2676
02:35:58,920 --> 02:36:01,170
I want to enter politics

2677
02:36:05,130 --> 02:36:06,330
What do you say?

2678
02:36:07,210 --> 02:36:08,500
Everyone...

2679
02:36:08,540 --> 02:36:10,540
...looks up to you as God!

2680
02:36:14,040 --> 02:36:18,420
In the political arena, you will also be
an ordinary man like everyone else, dear

2681
02:36:19,210 --> 02:36:20,540
Tarakam

2682
02:36:20,750 --> 02:36:22,920
For the people
who made me God...

2683
02:36:23,170 --> 02:36:26,830
...I am ready to become
an ordinary man now

2684
02:36:28,250 --> 02:36:29,380
But, my dear-

2685
02:36:29,420 --> 02:36:31,080
People are God, Tarakam

2686
02:36:32,080 --> 02:36:34,880
60 million women are struggling
with atrocities everyday

2687
02:36:35,290 --> 02:36:37,460
It is my responsibility
to protect them

2688
02:36:51,460 --> 02:36:52,670
Tarakam...?

2689
02:36:54,210 --> 02:36:55,460
Tarakam...?

2690
02:36:59,170 --> 02:37:00,380
Where is mother?

2691
02:37:00,420 --> 02:37:01,960
Father

2692
02:37:02,540 --> 02:37:04,420
I will be delayed
catching my flight

2693
02:37:05,290 --> 02:37:06,500
Tarakam...?

2694
02:37:07,580 --> 02:37:08,580
Tarakam

2695
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:15,130
Brother...?

2696
02:37:15,170 --> 02:37:16,960
I will come up to the airport, brother

2697
02:37:25,250 --> 02:37:28,460
Mother said you and she
will never differ in your wishes

2698
02:37:34,250 --> 02:37:36,130
When you stepped out
to go to work

2699
02:37:36,170 --> 02:37:38,330
...I will come to our porch
to bid you farewell

2700
02:37:38,750 --> 02:37:41,170
You are going for the sake
of our people, right?

2701
02:37:41,420 --> 02:37:43,170
I will come up to the airport!

2702
02:37:52,080 --> 02:37:54,170
'If my beloved Tarakam sends me off'

2703
02:37:54,330 --> 02:37:57,170
'...whatever the field
I will taste the fruits of success'

2704
02:37:57,500 --> 02:37:58,500
Shall we start?

2705
02:37:58,540 --> 02:38:00,460
Praise be to Goddess
Pathala Bhairavi!

2706
02:38:28,210 --> 02:38:30,290
'I can try changing human beings'

2707
02:38:30,380 --> 02:38:32,880
'But how can I change the system?'

2708
02:38:32,920 --> 02:38:34,460
'That is why I resigned'

2709
02:38:34,670 --> 02:38:38,210
'What is this Andhra and Tamil Nadu?
All are Madrasis from South India?'

2710
02:38:39,960 --> 02:38:43,170
'Our Telugu community has become
irrelevant in our nation now'

2711
02:38:43,210 --> 02:38:46,960
'We have to reiterate our presence
in a loud voice for the nation to realize'

2712
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:48,330
'Do you want to eat rice?'

2713
02:38:48,380 --> 02:38:53,960
'If you want to eat rice everyday
the God we pray to has to come down'

2714
02:39:11,380 --> 02:39:15,170
'Praise be to NTR'

2715
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,170
Welcome, Mr Rama Rao

2716
02:39:37,540 --> 02:39:39,670
Mr Bhaskara Rao
How are you?

2717
02:39:41,540 --> 02:39:44,960
Along with my supporters
I have resigned from the Congress

2718
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:47,580
We are with you
Your followers!

2719
02:39:51,210 --> 02:39:52,500
Namaste

2720
02:39:52,920 --> 02:39:56,130
'People respect and love you
to make you win the election'

2721
02:39:56,170 --> 02:39:58,540
I have the experience to run this party

2722
02:39:58,710 --> 02:40:00,790
Let us first think of
a name for the party

2723
02:40:00,830 --> 02:40:02,790
Then draft out
rules and regulations

2724
02:40:02,830 --> 02:40:05,130
For the golden future of our people...

2725
02:40:05,170 --> 02:40:06,790
...without their participation

2726
02:40:06,830 --> 02:40:09,500
...to discuss within these
4 walls is a waste of time

2727
02:40:09,540 --> 02:40:10,920
Mr Bhaskara Rao

2728
02:40:10,960 --> 02:40:13,960
Can you arrange for a mike
outside MLA quarters?

2729
02:40:14,460 --> 02:40:15,670
Certainly

2730
02:40:28,710 --> 02:40:30,040
We are...

2731
02:40:32,580 --> 02:40:34,290
...starting a political party!

2732
02:40:34,330 --> 02:40:36,880
Praise be to NTR!

2733
02:40:36,960 --> 02:40:39,250
Praise be to NTR!

2734
02:40:42,830 --> 02:40:46,170
[loud cheering]

2735
02:40:53,750 --> 02:40:55,000
Please sit down

2736
02:41:01,460 --> 02:41:02,750
This is...

2737
02:41:03,330 --> 02:41:06,170
...to have the required authority
to serve the people

2738
02:41:07,130 --> 02:41:09,790
To bring about
much needed changes

2739
02:41:10,250 --> 02:41:13,040
For a full fledged working Govt

2740
02:41:15,170 --> 02:41:17,170
For the Telugu community

2741
02:41:25,790 --> 02:41:28,830
For the eternal existence of Telugu land

2742
02:41:32,290 --> 02:41:35,540
For the future of
the son of Telugu soil

2743
02:41:37,460 --> 02:41:41,290
For the self respect
of every Telugu man and woman

2744
02:41:45,880 --> 02:41:47,210
Our Party

2745
02:41:53,460 --> 02:41:55,460
Our Party is

2746
02:41:58,790 --> 02:42:02,170
TELUGU DESAM

2747
02:42:19,960 --> 02:42:21,000
'The Beginning...'

2748
02:42:21,040 --> 02:42:22,750
'That is not a mere individual's voice'

2749
02:42:22,790 --> 02:42:26,040
'But voices of the needy in unison
that appeased their hunger'

2750
02:42:26,080 --> 02:42:29,290
'The voice that wiped their tears dry'

2751
02:42:29,330 --> 02:42:35,000
'The ignored heartbeats in accordance
as 1 voice of 60 million Telugus'

2752
02:42:35,040 --> 02:42:39,540
'The Telugu voice that uprooted
the tree of dictatorship to the ground'

2753
02:42:39,580 --> 02:42:42,790
'The Telugu State is not instrumental
in enlisting the number of voters'

2754
02:42:42,830 --> 02:42:45,670
'But it changes
the destiny of Indian politics'

2755
02:42:45,750 --> 02:42:49,960
'He is a dreamer, hard worker, toiler
and supporter of the labor class'

2756
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:52,500
'The Hero who fought
for the sake of our motherland'

2757
02:42:52,540 --> 02:42:55,500
'The Great Leader who re-wrote
the history of Indian politics'

2758
02:42:55,630 --> 02:42:59,000
'NTR The Great Leader'

2759
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:15,750
"NTR"

2760
02:43:18,960 --> 02:43:26,960
"If you don Rama's role, avatar of Vishnu
our hearts as temples will consecrate you"

2761
02:43:30,500 --> 02:43:38,130
"As Lord Krishna on screen if you appear
our hearts in devotion melt like butter"

2762
02:43:42,080 --> 02:43:47,580
"Even if God above descends in reality
we will not accept him as our deity"

2763
02:43:47,750 --> 02:43:55,210
"If God asks us why we will say
He does not resemble NTR in any way"

2764
02:43:56,630 --> 02:43:59,830
"We woke up at dawn really early
We packed our lunch and ready"

2765
02:43:59,880 --> 02:44:02,210
"We came in our bullock carts eagerly"

2766
02:44:02,250 --> 02:44:05,500
"We tore our shirts many happily
We shouted our throats hoarse loudly"

2767
02:44:05,580 --> 02:44:09,330
"Our love for you is for eternity"

2768
02:44:11,040 --> 02:44:16,830
"Reading about the fame you have acquired
even history will perspire for sure inspired"

2769
02:44:16,960 --> 02:44:22,040
"With success as the endless sky
you are the moon riding high"

2770
02:44:45,630 --> 02:44:52,210
"If you sing a song, tune enhanced
you will be saluted by the poet's hand"

2771
02:44:57,250 --> 02:45:04,630
"Listening to your honeyed words melodious
Telugu as a language will be most joyous"

2772
02:45:08,830 --> 02:45:14,460
"If any roles still remain
we have not seen you in"

2773
02:45:14,540 --> 02:45:21,210
"We can puff up our chest
it is their loss not yours at best!"

2774
02:45:22,330 --> 02:45:25,830
"Proudly our notebooks we cover
with your photos from the newspaper"

2775
02:45:25,880 --> 02:45:28,290
"Like a hero we pose too
idealizing our idol true"

2776
02:45:28,330 --> 02:45:31,500
"Like our eyes we cherish you
We tattooed your name and face too"

2777
02:45:31,580 --> 02:45:34,880
"Jewel in the crown for cinema true"

2778
02:45:37,170 --> 02:45:40,000
"We will not praise you sky high"

2779
02:45:40,080 --> 02:45:42,750
"If we cast an evil eye
Bad luck strikes you, that's why"

2780
02:45:42,830 --> 02:45:48,170
"Our hearts that hold you precious
cannot bear anything inauspicious"

2781
02:45:48,920 --> 02:45:51,830
"New spring is here
