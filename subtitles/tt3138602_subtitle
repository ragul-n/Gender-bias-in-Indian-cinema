1
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:17,875
Guruji.

2
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:21,083
Shall I call this a way of
life or the demands of time?

3
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:22,625
That today every person..

4
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:26,250
...Is just running in a race
to fulfill their desires.

5
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,871
What would you say, Guruji?

6
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:31,708
See, what can we say about desires..
There is no end to desires.

7
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,666
Desire as much as you please.

8
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:38,625
I mean to say..

9
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:43,833
...that before the correct time
and before what is destined..

10
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:49,083
...no one has ever got what they
desired and nor will they ever.

11
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:53,041
So as I say in the form of hymns..

12
00:02:53,541 --> 00:03:01,125
"..People, don't curse your own destiny."

13
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:04,833
"Life will be okay.. say.."

14
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,791
"Life will be okay-okay.."

15
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:11,416
"Life will be okay." - "Life will be okay."

16
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:15,000
"Life will be okay-okay.."

17
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:21,250
"Life will be okay. Say it."

18
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,583
Aman.

19
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:26,791
Gunjan.

20
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:30,416
Sabina.

21
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:34,416
Miss.. you.. rascals.

22
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:48,958
Bakshi.

23
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,958
Taranjeet. Taranjeet. Taranjeet.

24
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:58,583
Bakshi. Bakshi. Bakshi.

25
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:02,791
TJ.

26
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:03,791
TJ.

27
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,875
TJ. TJ.

28
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:05,919
Bakshi..

29
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,916
Scoundrel.

30
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:31,166
"Neither did anybody pray
nor did anybody ask."

31
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:39,125
"You're the best friend,
you hang by my scarf."

32
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:46,583
"You're the best friend,
you hang by my scarf."

33
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:51,125
"Your dad was shocked, yet,
happy birthday to you!"

34
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,958
"Happy birthday, happy birthday,
happy birthday to you."

35
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:58,958
"Happy birthday, happy birthday,
happy birthday to you."

36
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:06,875
"Neither did anybody pray
nor did anybody ask."

37
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:26,541
"I wrote a few lines in your praise."

38
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:30,375
"He wrote some and I wrote some."

39
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:34,041
"Listen to it!"

40
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:38,708
"Hey dog! You rascal!
I'll beat you to pulp!"

41
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:42,916
"You'll study hard and become an officer."

42
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:46,541
"But who'll pay for it?"

43
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:51,166
"It was hard on our purse,
yet, happy birthday to you."

44
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:54,916
"Happy birthday, happy birthday,
happy birthday to you."

45
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:58,916
"Happy birthday, happy birthday,
happy birthday to you."

46
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:06,916
"Neither did anybody pray
nor did anybody ask."

47
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:40,958
"I have to forget the entire
world and pick up your phone."

48
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:48,500
"I have picked up the phone
for the sake of your heart."

49
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,958
Hello.

50
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:55,958
Hello.

51
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:03,166
Rascal.

52
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:07,166
My fingers have gone numb looking for you.

53
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:13,208
Where have you been all these years?

54
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:19,708
Yes. I'm fine, but..

55
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:24,083
Where are you?

56
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:25,666
Where?

57
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:29,666
Fiji?

58
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,250
No one came because I called.

59
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,458
Everyone came only because Bakshi called.

60
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,398
If you hadn't come even this time..

61
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,000
...I would've deleted you all from my life.

62
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,291
Yeah right.

63
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,871
- You didn't even attend Sabina's marriage.
- Who me?

64
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:57,796
Hello. - Gunjan. - Yes.

65
00:07:58,291 --> 00:07:59,541
Just landed.

66
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,916
Guys. I had a fractured leg.

67
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:03,583
Plastered for two months.

68
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,243
I even uploaded my pictures.

69
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:06,743
You posted a comment as well.

70
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,916
And a 'Like' too.

71
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:11,833
Sabi. Would I ever miss your marriage?

72
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,416
- No, Fatty. It's okay.
- Exactly.

73
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,125
Where there is 'Gu' there is stress

74
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:20,306
It was someone else's marriage, but
she's the one with the problem.

75
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,500
Can you smoke somewhere else please?

76
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,333
Not good for the baby.

77
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,291
- Should I hold her?
- No, no.

78
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,431
- You must be tired.
- I'm good. I'm good.

79
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,416
Guys, check this out!

80
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:37,416
'Bula.'

81
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:45,912
Click a photo of this, too.

82
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:49,708
Nobody in your family would've
been honoured so much before.

83
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:07,666
Oh my darling.

84
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:16,416
Where in the world have they brought us?

85
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,791
Look at Bakshi's ship.

86
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,916
Eh fatty, that's a 'yaat'.

87
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:38,916
For your information,
you call it a 'Yacht'.

88
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,583
Oh! So cute.

89
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,458
Come. Come, baby.

90
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,875
Wait. Wait.

91
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:58,541
Smart dog.

92
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:02,541
He made a run for it.

93
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:04,416
Relax.

94
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:05,208
Relax.

95
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:08,708
Nothing is going to happen.

96
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:12,125
Oh dear.. I'm there..

97
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:13,541
I'm with you.

98
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:17,000
Just keep walking. Hey darling..

99
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,541
Darling..

100
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,041
Baby. I'm with you.

101
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:22,458
I'm there.

102
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:23,708
You'll be okay.

103
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:27,541
Just keep walking.

104
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,500
Come.

105
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,500
Sabi. One step at a time.

106
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:42,541
Baby!

107
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,666
Sabina. We're almost there.

108
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:59,958
Come on.

109
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,708
Hmmm. Nice machine.

110
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:06,708
What's the mileage?

111
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,916
Bonjour!

112
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:30,833
She's saying 'Hello'.

113
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:35,125
Reply to her.

114
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,500
Stop showing off, Bakshi.

115
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,500
Grow up

116
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,875
The show's just started.

117
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,095
How are you kids?

118
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,500
Bakshi, my brother. How are you?

119
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,040
So happy to see you, man.

120
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:46,006
So happy to see you.

121
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,500
How are you?

122
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,791
What's up?

123
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:52,125
Hello.

124
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:53,665
Jeanine, meet my friends.

125
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:56,791
- This is Aman.
- Aman.

126
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:58,208
Wait.

127
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,708
- That's Gunjan.
- Gunjan.

128
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:01,875
Hi.

129
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:03,250
And that's Fatty.

130
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,833
Fatty!

131
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:08,875
- You look so pretty.
- Come back.

132
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,916
Pleased to meet you.

133
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,791
Taranjeet Singh Bakshi.

134
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,571
Well, judging by your company..

135
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,166
...we know what you've been
up to all these years.

136
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:22,666
But please, ask her to wear something.

137
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:27,083
It's evening, she might catch a cold.

138
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,666
Ah you're here, my child.

139
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,875
How are you?

140
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,541
I am so happy to see you.

141
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,875
So, you're the Mr. Wonderful.

142
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:40,416
Deepak.

143
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:43,125
Thanks for inviting us.
Thank you very much.

144
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:46,000
- And this is little Sarah.
- Sarah.

145
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,458
Sarah, look here.

146
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:51,000
You're even prettier than your mother.

147
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,291
Okay.

148
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:53,831
How old are you, darling?

149
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:55,848
Its her first birthday day after tomorrow

150
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:59,708
Welcome to Fiji, Sarah.

151
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:06,375
"All the world aside I've
answered only your call."

152
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:10,375
"I've taken a loan to win your heart."

153
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:24,666
"All the world aside I've
answered only your call."

154
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:28,666
"I've taken a loan to win your heart."

155
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:33,000
"There must be a price for your beauty."

156
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,708
"There must be a price for your beauty."

157
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:39,916
"Baby, tell me.. how much, how much!"

158
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,250
"Baby, tell me.. how much, how much!"

159
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,875
"Baby, tell me.. how much, how much!"

160
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:46,936
"I'm going to love you all night long."

161
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,000
"Baby, tell me.. how much, how much!"

162
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,333
"Baby, tell me.. how much, how much!"

163
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,916
"Baby, tell me.. how much, how much!"

164
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,916
"I'm going to love you all night long."

165
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
"When your bangles tinker,
my heart skips a beat."

166
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,000
"My heart finds serenity, in
the alley of your heart."

167
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:29,166
"She stole my heart. It beats
hard, she stole my heart."

168
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:33,791
"There must be a price for your beauty."

169
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:38,208
"There must be a price for your beauty."

170
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,500
"Baby, tell me.. how much, how much!"

171
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,833
"Baby, tell me.. how much, how much!"

172
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:45,416
"Baby, tell me.. how much, how much!"

173
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,500
"I'm going to love you all night long."

174
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,666
"Baby, tell me.. how much, how much!"

175
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,916
"Baby, tell me.. how much, how much!"

176
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:54,333
"Baby, tell me.. how much, how much!"

177
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:58,333
"I'm going to love you all night long."

178
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,250
"You're a bigger fraud than you look."

179
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,541
"Flirting around with every girl."

180
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:27,541
"You are nothing but a roadside Romeo."

181
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:34,500
"Show me your love, or suffer my wrath."

182
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
"You can't get your hands on me.."

183
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,460
"..even if you sign off
your entire cheque book."

184
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:43,500
"There must be a price for your beauty."

185
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,083
"There must be a price for your beauty."

186
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,416
"Baby, tell me.. how much, how much!"

187
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,583
"Baby, tell me.. how much, how much!"

188
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,208
"Baby, tell me.. how much, how much!"

189
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,269
"I'm going to love you all night long."

190
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,500
"Baby, tell me.. how much, how much!"

191
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,791
"Baby, tell me.. how much, how much!"

192
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,125
"Baby, tell me.. how much, how much!"

193
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,333
"I'm going to love you all night long."

194
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,583
"Baby, tell me.. how much, how much!"

195
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,875
"Baby, tell me.. how much, how much!"

196
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,208
"Baby, tell me.. how much, how much!"

197
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:17,208
"I'm going to love you all night long."

198
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,458
Bakshi!

199
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:17,718
Why did you set sail
without telling anyone?

200
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,958
I have no network.

201
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:21,333
I had to make a few important calls.

202
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:26,500
I always do as I please

203
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,083
Gu, my love.

204
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:29,666
It's a beautiful day.

205
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:33,666
- Yetu.
- Forget your phone.

206
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,851
- What happened?
- Someone's at the door.

207
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,791
See who it is, I'll look after Sarah.

208
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:46,750
- Baby.
- Coming.

209
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,000
Coming. Coming.

210
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,583
Good morning

211
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,041
What happened?

212
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:53,821
Aman, what are you looking for?

213
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:57,000
That foreigner has been hogging
the other loo since morning.

214
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:03,666
- But Brother, you scared the kid.
- Sorry, sir.

215
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,583
'Deep'.

216
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:09,583
Are we moving?

217
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,958
Same old Bakshi..

218
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:18,958
Just set sail in the morning..

219
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,000
Jeanine.

220
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:36,666
- I knew we had similarities.
- Taste?

221
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,375
- No.
- No?

222
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:42,375
Our ancestors you see have been in touch.

223
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,750
Jeanine.

224
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:56,250
"If only we never come to our senses."

225
00:18:57,208 --> 00:19:00,708
"If only we never come to our senses."

226
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:12,583
The speed's controlled by
the wind and the sail.

227
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:13,583
Look.

228
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,916
Wind-speed. Direction. Depth.

229
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,791
Boat's speed. Compass. Etcetera. Etcetera.

230
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,250
If you want to slow down the boat..

231
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,041
...we need to turn the mast
against the wind's direction..

232
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:26,500
...and lower the sails one by one.

233
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,375
Takes time.

234
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,375
And that, lone ranger.

235
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:33,416
To lower and raise the ladder.

236
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:36,166
Stairway to heaven.

237
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:39,291
So champion, take the wheel.

238
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:40,375
Welcome

239
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:41,833
- Slept well?
- Yeah.

240
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:45,958
Slept well. But, woke up with a shock.

241
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:48,791
Hey! Do you still kick in your sleep?

242
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:51,583
Funny, Taran. But where are we going?

243
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:52,916
We've set sail.

244
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:55,083
We'll definitely get somewhere.

245
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:56,375
Bakshi.

246
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:59,541
Hope you told Aman.. this
is not his papa's car?

247
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,166
He might just take us straight to heaven.

248
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,250
Don't worry.

249
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:08,041
People like you.. have a
one-way ticket down, to hell

250
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,416
Breakfast, everybody.

251
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,000
Oh!

252
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,416
Well done, lass.

253
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:18,416
Wait, wait, wait, I am coming.

254
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:32,291
- Cheers, guys.
- Cheers!

255
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,333
Even Bakshi's made it big.

256
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:45,375
How long are you going
to stay at home, Aman?

257
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:48,500
You're such a bore.

258
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,361
My father owns two petrol-pumps..

259
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,030
...they're doing good business..

260
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,441
...then why should I break a sweat?

261
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,541
Is it compulsory?

262
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,583
It's not about working hard..

263
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,458
...It's about living
life on your own terms.

264
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:02,718
You don't have to do
everything parents say.

265
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:04,000
"Get married now, don't get married now."

266
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,708
"Wear this, don't go there.." - Gu!

267
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:09,916
All mom said was, "There is no
need for you to go to Bangalore."

268
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:13,125
Couldn't you find a job in Delhi?

269
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:17,583
I tried stopping you,
but you didn't listen?

270
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:22,791
Instead of stopping me I
wish you had come along.

271
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:26,083
Basically..

272
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:30,791
You never loved me.

273
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,875
Love at first sight.

274
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,495
I think.. the entire office
fell in love with Sabina.

275
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:38,000
Nonsense, Deep.

276
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,140
I don't think there's been a single day..

277
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:43,208
...when I don't thank my lucky stars..

278
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:47,208
That we're together.

279
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:52,291
I remember.. before Sabina joined..

280
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,041
...I used to hate my job.

281
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:56,500
These corporate are very negative.

282
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,916
They all try to suppress each other.

283
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:00,537
It wasn't that bad a scene.

284
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:01,458
What..

285
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:04,291
Sometimes.. we bump into the wrong people.

286
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,191
And anyway, after your boss left..

287
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:06,791
...everything turned out fine.

288
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:09,375
See. Nothing can bring her down.

289
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:11,833
She finds a balance in everything..

290
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:13,333
...to keep herself happy.

291
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:17,750
Sabi. When did you turn so naive?

292
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,583
You were so cynical in school.

293
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:21,041
Always cribbing.

294
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:24,125
Sabina? No chance.

295
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:26,000
Mr. Deepak.

296
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,500
You haven't seen all the
facets of your wife yet.

297
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,958
And it's better if he doesn't.

298
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:34,250
Deep, we used to create
a ruckus in school..

299
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:35,950
...and get punished every day.

300
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:37,791
Affect of bad company.

301
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:39,250
Correct.

302
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:42,666
- One bad fish can..
- Capitan.

303
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:47,041
- Yeah!
- I am bored.

304
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:50,000
- I want to go for a swim.
- Go ahead.

305
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,181
You don't worry.

306
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:54,125
Hey, Junkie. Stop the boat.

307
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:58,125
Your sister-in-law wants to take a plunge.

308
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:04,958
Rubbish!

309
00:23:26,125 --> 00:23:29,625
Move! Move! Move!

310
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:38,750
What the..

311
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:44,291
Fatty. Here you go.

312
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:46,125
Careful.

313
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,500
You two have been drinking since morning.

314
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,640
She's delicate.

315
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:50,708
Take care.

316
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:52,500
Fatty.

317
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,875
Why did you do.. this?

318
00:23:56,375 --> 00:24:00,416
You should.. 'swish'!

319
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:03,541
Water's too cold, right?

320
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:05,041
Deep.

321
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:08,541
Go on.

322
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:12,458
I'll sit with you right here.

323
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:15,333
Sweetheart. Don't worry about me, okay.

324
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:17,375
Anyway, it's time for Sarah's nap.

325
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:21,375
You go, enjoy.

326
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:26,666
- Sure?
- Absolutely.

327
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:37,416
Coming, brother.

328
00:24:37,916 --> 00:24:39,666
You go, I'll follow.

329
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:40,708
Oh yes, yes.

330
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:44,708
We're going to sleep.

331
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:49,166
...beach..

332
00:24:49,666 --> 00:24:50,587
This is Simmons beach.

333
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:51,585
That is pretty shallow.

334
00:24:51,916 --> 00:24:52,916
Really?

335
00:24:53,416 --> 00:24:53,916
Oh..

336
00:24:57,958 --> 00:24:59,791
Correct.

337
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:03,791
Thank you.

338
00:25:52,833 --> 00:25:56,500
I am sure you won't go in.

339
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,666
I am going.

340
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:03,250
But, I know who you're waiting for.

341
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:07,250
Yeah right.

342
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:15,583
Silly girl.

343
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:25,916
- Stop it.
- Come on. It's just water.

344
00:26:26,416 --> 00:26:28,791
Yes, it's time to relax.

345
00:26:29,291 --> 00:26:33,125
- Isn't that right, Deepak?
- Oh yes, of course.

346
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:34,708
That's why we're here.

347
00:26:35,208 --> 00:26:38,375
It's our first holiday as
well after Sarah was born.

348
00:26:38,875 --> 00:26:42,375
Really?

349
00:26:59,083 --> 00:27:03,625
"Oh pretty dreams, come quietly."

350
00:27:04,125 --> 00:27:08,625
And make my baby sleep."

351
00:27:09,125 --> 00:27:13,875
"From the lane of the moon.
From the road of stars."

352
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:18,708
"Come quickly."

353
00:27:19,208 --> 00:27:23,958
"From the land of the fairies
& the court of dolls."

354
00:27:24,458 --> 00:27:27,958
"Take her through a journey of dreams."

355
00:27:41,291 --> 00:27:44,791
I didn't think you would come.

356
00:27:51,666 --> 00:27:53,666
I know.

357
00:27:54,166 --> 00:27:57,666
That's why I wanted to come, Taran.

358
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:03,375
You left without saying a word.

359
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:07,375
Just vanished.

360
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:16,333
I don't want an apology.

361
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:20,916
I've found my life.

362
00:28:21,416 --> 00:28:23,083
You used to say..

363
00:28:23,583 --> 00:28:27,083
...don't wait around for happiness.

364
00:28:31,875 --> 00:28:37,500
You remembered what I said, but not me.

365
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,666
It's difficult to live in the past, Taran.

366
00:28:43,166 --> 00:28:46,666
I've moved on.

367
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:57,291
- I still miss you.
- Taran.

368
00:28:57,791 --> 00:29:01,291
I think it's time for
you to move on as well.

369
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:15,208
I'm happy for you, Sabi.

370
00:29:15,708 --> 00:29:19,208
Shall we?

371
00:29:28,916 --> 00:29:30,333
Sabina?

372
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:32,083
She's a trained doctor.

373
00:29:32,583 --> 00:29:34,375
- Oh really?
- Yeah.

374
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:36,416
But she doesn't practice anymore.

375
00:29:36,916 --> 00:29:39,416
- Are you also a doctor?
- Yeah.

376
00:29:39,916 --> 00:29:40,916
Actually, no.

377
00:29:41,416 --> 00:29:42,977
Right now I'm working with a company..

378
00:29:43,458 --> 00:29:45,291
...that sells medicines.

379
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:46,912
Everything is set, Jeanine.

380
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:50,125
Wife. Kid. And a good pay.

381
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:51,875
All set.

382
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:54,083
What?

383
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:55,083
Come on.

384
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:56,821
I'll explain to you in private.

385
00:29:57,041 --> 00:29:58,721
Brother-in-law, we'll be back in a minute.

386
00:29:58,916 --> 00:29:59,750
- See..
- Please.

387
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:01,458
I'll tell you, what..

388
00:30:01,958 --> 00:30:03,666
Actually, I'll explain to you..

389
00:30:04,166 --> 00:30:06,208
Actually, marriages are made in heaven.

390
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:07,468
And not in waters.

391
00:30:07,916 --> 00:30:10,958
All of a sudden, these two people meet..

392
00:30:11,458 --> 00:30:18,416
You know.. handsome like
me, and sexy like you.

393
00:30:18,916 --> 00:30:22,000
So, any plans.. for returning to India?

394
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,125
No.

395
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:26,333
I talk to mom sometimes.

396
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:30,333
What keeps you so busy?

397
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,375
It's been just one day..

398
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:39,791
...and you've started
monitoring my life again.

399
00:30:40,291 --> 00:30:44,375
My God. You haven't changed a bit. Right?

400
00:30:44,875 --> 00:30:46,166
You haven't changed either.

401
00:30:46,666 --> 00:30:49,750
You're still so scared of water.

402
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:52,500
Juhi's accident wasn't your fault.

403
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I know.

404
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,958
I thought I will get over it.

405
00:30:58,458 --> 00:30:59,958
- But..
- But what?

406
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:02,166
Get over it.

407
00:31:02,666 --> 00:31:03,958
Trust me.

408
00:31:04,458 --> 00:31:05,583
I wish I could.

409
00:31:06,083 --> 00:31:09,583
It's easier said than done.

410
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:15,000
By the way, I've a quick solution.

411
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:17,928
Taran. Taran, no.

412
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:19,095
Taran. Taran, no.

413
00:31:19,541 --> 00:31:23,041
Taran!

414
00:31:30,916 --> 00:31:34,416
Taran!

415
00:31:59,166 --> 00:31:59,750
Baby.

416
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,375
Baby, breathe.

417
00:32:01,875 --> 00:32:03,333
Yes, breathe.

418
00:32:03,833 --> 00:32:05,375
Relax! Relax!

419
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:06,595
Nothing happened.

420
00:32:07,041 --> 00:32:08,250
I'm right here.

421
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,083
You're absolutely fine.

422
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:13,541
What are you doing?

423
00:32:14,041 --> 00:32:16,500
Bakshi. Why?

424
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,708
You know, still.

425
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:20,833
Relax, she'll be fine.

426
00:32:21,333 --> 00:32:22,853
That's how she'll get rid of her fear.

427
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:24,666
Sir, she's not a 10 year old kid..

428
00:32:25,166 --> 00:32:30,833
...whom you shoved into the
deep-end of a swimming-pool.

429
00:32:31,333 --> 00:32:32,541
Deep.

430
00:32:33,041 --> 00:32:35,708
Please.. take me up.

431
00:32:36,208 --> 00:32:37,166
We'll go.

432
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:39,791
You're wearing a life-vest.

433
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,212
We'll take you slowly.

434
00:32:41,666 --> 00:32:42,426
Don't worry, Sabi.

435
00:32:42,833 --> 00:32:44,125
You'll be fine, okay.

436
00:32:44,625 --> 00:32:47,083
Breathe.

437
00:32:47,583 --> 00:32:51,083
Relax.

438
00:32:55,291 --> 00:32:55,875
It's okay.

439
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:57,833
Chill Muscles. It happens.

440
00:32:58,333 --> 00:33:00,208
Look at the sky.

441
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:01,750
Take a look.

442
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:04,458
Come on. I'm done swimming.

443
00:33:04,958 --> 00:33:10,625
I'm going to take a nap.

444
00:33:11,125 --> 00:33:13,291
Don't worry, Capitan.

445
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:15,833
- She will be fine.
- Yeah, she will be fine.

446
00:33:16,333 --> 00:33:19,875
Relax.

447
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:21,958
- Hey!
- Yes.

448
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:23,259
Where's the ladder?

449
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:24,583
Is it on the other side?

450
00:33:24,791 --> 00:33:26,541
Ladder?

451
00:33:27,041 --> 00:33:28,166
What's he saying?

452
00:33:28,666 --> 00:33:32,166
I'll take a look.

453
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,490
You also want to go that side.

454
00:33:35,916 --> 00:33:37,666
Let's go, yes.

455
00:33:38,166 --> 00:33:39,291
Is Bakshi coming?

456
00:33:39,791 --> 00:33:43,291
There he is.

457
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:50,583
What the..

458
00:33:59,291 --> 00:34:01,083
Why didn't the stairs come down?

459
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:02,500
They did.

460
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,208
I took the stairs down.

461
00:34:04,708 --> 00:34:05,416
What?

462
00:34:05,916 --> 00:34:07,708
- You took the stairs.
- Yes.

463
00:34:08,208 --> 00:34:10,333
I climbed down the stairs.

464
00:34:10,833 --> 00:34:13,791
Why did you touch the button?

465
00:34:14,291 --> 00:34:15,458
Are you crazy?

466
00:34:15,958 --> 00:34:18,750
You told me about the switch.

467
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:20,875
What did I do wrong?

468
00:34:21,375 --> 00:34:24,083
How did the stairs retract again?

469
00:34:24,583 --> 00:34:27,500
Because I pressed the
button before I jumped.

470
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,541
Bakshi..

471
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:32,161
We always have to bear the
brunt for you showing off.

472
00:34:32,541 --> 00:34:34,208
But I didn't know the ladder was down.

473
00:34:34,708 --> 00:34:37,583
Who told you to jump without looking

474
00:34:38,083 --> 00:34:40,500
Guys, please.

475
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,416
Let's play this blame game later.

476
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:45,436
Taran, how do we get the ladder down?

477
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,666
We've to take Sabina up.

478
00:34:49,166 --> 00:34:51,333
We'll go.

479
00:34:51,833 --> 00:34:54,833
- Taran.
- I'm thinking.

480
00:34:55,333 --> 00:34:56,750
I'm thinking.

481
00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:00,000
What do you mean?

482
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:05,791
I mean I'm thinking how do we get up.

483
00:35:06,291 --> 00:35:09,416
You mean.. we're stuck.

484
00:35:09,916 --> 00:35:13,416
Maybe.

485
00:35:57,041 --> 00:36:01,208
Thank God.. we had breakfast.

486
00:36:01,708 --> 00:36:03,583
Gu

487
00:36:04,083 --> 00:36:06,666
Sabi. You're scared.

488
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:10,708
Don't worry. We'll find a way. Okay.

489
00:36:11,208 --> 00:36:14,916
My baby's on-board.

490
00:36:15,416 --> 00:36:18,916
Sarah's alone.

491
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:24,750
- Aman. Come here.
- What happened?

492
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,916
Its not as easy as it looks.

493
00:36:27,416 --> 00:36:28,833
Can't reach it.

494
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:32,291
Come here.

495
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:33,958
Come here.

496
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:37,958
I'll try to climb on your
shoulder and reach up.

497
00:36:51,666 --> 00:36:53,375
This won't work.

498
00:36:53,875 --> 00:36:57,375
Wait. Let me try.

499
00:37:16,583 --> 00:37:19,416
- Gunjan.
- Watch out.

500
00:37:19,916 --> 00:37:21,750
Are you hurt?

501
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:24,916
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Okay.

502
00:37:25,416 --> 00:37:27,666
You never listen, do you?

503
00:37:28,166 --> 00:37:29,583
This won't work.

504
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:31,416
We need something.

505
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,208
Something to hold on to.

506
00:37:33,708 --> 00:37:36,333
That can take our weight for a few seconds.

507
00:37:36,833 --> 00:37:40,000
But both the sides are completely plain.

508
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,208
Nothing to hold on to.

509
00:37:42,708 --> 00:37:44,541
Oh, God!

510
00:37:45,041 --> 00:37:46,666
Bakshi. Guys.

511
00:37:47,166 --> 00:37:48,541
I'm sure we'll find help.

512
00:37:49,041 --> 00:37:51,041
Someone will definitely pass this way.

513
00:37:51,541 --> 00:37:56,750
This isn't India, where once you're stuck..

514
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:58,833
You're stuck.

515
00:37:59,333 --> 00:38:02,125
What are you talking?

516
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:04,500
Bakshi, what's happening?

517
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,250
I want to go up on the boat.

518
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:08,541
Now!

519
00:38:09,041 --> 00:38:10,041
Now! Now! Now!

520
00:38:10,541 --> 00:38:13,416
Bakshi. I want to go up on the boat now.

521
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:14,956
- Calm down, Jeanine.
- No.

522
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:16,250
Bakshi, what's wrong?

523
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,591
- Calm down.
- I want to go up on the boat now.

524
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:20,958
- I want to get out of here.
- It's not good for you.

525
00:38:21,458 --> 00:38:23,666
Get me out of here.

526
00:38:24,166 --> 00:38:25,250
- I'm trying.
- Aman.

527
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:26,916
- Yeti.
- I want to go up.

528
00:38:27,416 --> 00:38:28,666
Yetu!

529
00:38:29,166 --> 00:38:31,541
Where's the ladder switch?

530
00:38:32,041 --> 00:38:33,250
Left of the steering-wheel.

531
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:34,958
Towards the railing.

532
00:38:35,458 --> 00:38:38,958
Okay. Wait here.

533
00:38:58,666 --> 00:39:00,875
Yeti.

534
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:04,708
Yeti.

535
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:06,208
Yeti.

536
00:39:06,708 --> 00:39:10,250
Yetu.

537
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:14,250
Yetu.

538
00:39:16,041 --> 00:39:16,916
Aman.

539
00:39:17,416 --> 00:39:18,583
Call him back to your side.

540
00:39:19,083 --> 00:39:20,000
Yeti.

541
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,250
Yetu.

542
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:25,250
Get him excited.

543
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:32,166
Yeti.

544
00:39:32,666 --> 00:39:36,166
Yeti. Yeti. Yeti.

545
00:39:42,708 --> 00:39:44,500
Yetu.

546
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,500
Yetu.

547
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,541
Yetu.

548
00:39:50,041 --> 00:39:53,541
Well done, guys.

549
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:07,041
Yeti.

550
00:40:07,541 --> 00:40:09,083
Yetu. Yetu.

551
00:40:09,583 --> 00:40:13,083
Come on, boy.

552
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:21,666
Yeti. Yeti.

553
00:40:22,166 --> 00:40:26,583
Yeti. Yeti. Yeti. Yeti.

554
00:40:27,083 --> 00:40:29,333
Yeti.

555
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:31,353
We'll have to try from Gunjan's side.

556
00:40:31,833 --> 00:40:35,333
Wait here.

557
00:40:51,458 --> 00:40:54,958
Come on. Come on, boy.

558
00:41:26,291 --> 00:41:29,791
What did you do?

559
00:41:37,458 --> 00:41:39,541
Oh no!

560
00:41:40,041 --> 00:41:41,333
What did you do?

561
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,375
Deora will kill me.

562
00:41:43,875 --> 00:41:45,458
What do you mean what did I do?

563
00:41:45,958 --> 00:41:47,166
Have you lost your mind?

564
00:41:47,666 --> 00:41:50,083
You're concerned about the dog.

565
00:41:50,583 --> 00:41:54,083
Who's Deora?

566
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:03,000
What is that?

567
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,416
There's something.

568
00:42:05,916 --> 00:42:08,125
- What is it?
- What?

569
00:42:08,625 --> 00:42:10,666
Don't know, baby.

570
00:42:11,166 --> 00:42:14,666
Something grazed past Jeanine.

571
00:42:48,166 --> 00:42:51,166
- What was it?
- No.

572
00:42:51,666 --> 00:42:54,041
Nothing.

573
00:42:54,541 --> 00:42:55,421
Jeanine, don't worry.

574
00:42:55,833 --> 00:42:59,416
- There was nothing.
- There was. I felt it.

575
00:42:59,916 --> 00:43:02,250
- Even if there was, it's gone now.
- No.

576
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:03,750
There's nothing now.

577
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:06,041
There's nothing now? Or there was nothing?

578
00:43:06,541 --> 00:43:10,041
Gunjan, there's no point in getting angry.

579
00:43:10,541 --> 00:43:12,666
- I'll figure out a way.
- I'm sure, Bakshi.

580
00:43:13,166 --> 00:43:14,833
Like always, right?

581
00:43:15,333 --> 00:43:16,958
- Gu, it's not my fault.
- Taran!

582
00:43:17,458 --> 00:43:18,875
Everyone!

583
00:43:19,375 --> 00:43:20,833
Please.

584
00:43:21,333 --> 00:43:23,166
Please, guys.

585
00:43:23,666 --> 00:43:25,541
Save your energy.

586
00:43:26,041 --> 00:43:29,375
We don't know how long we'll
have to stay in water.

587
00:43:29,875 --> 00:43:31,666
Please.

588
00:43:32,166 --> 00:43:33,250
Deepak.

589
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:36,666
Deepak. Sarah's up there.

590
00:43:37,166 --> 00:43:39,125
Alone.

591
00:43:39,625 --> 00:43:40,458
Please.

592
00:43:40,958 --> 00:43:44,458
Please figure out something soon.

593
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:50,541
Taran, no one's blaming you.

594
00:43:51,041 --> 00:43:55,000
But only you know about the water.

595
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:59,541
Please tell us what we can do.

596
00:44:00,041 --> 00:44:03,291
I'm sorry, guys.

597
00:44:03,791 --> 00:44:06,541
But right now, we can do just one thing.

598
00:44:07,041 --> 00:44:09,500
And that's 'wait'.

599
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I am sure someone will
definitely pass this way.

600
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,083
Help will come.

601
00:44:14,583 --> 00:44:16,541
Sabi's right.

602
00:44:17,041 --> 00:44:19,500
Let's save our energy.

603
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,500
We'll definitely get help.

604
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:53,625
Guys, my phone.

605
00:46:09,875 --> 00:46:13,916
There it is. On the cushion
behind this towel.

606
00:46:14,416 --> 00:46:15,166
No, it's not.

607
00:46:15,666 --> 00:46:19,166
Look.

608
00:46:21,041 --> 00:46:22,208
But how?

609
00:46:22,708 --> 00:46:26,208
What difference does it make?

610
00:46:31,375 --> 00:46:32,415
No one's going to pounce.

611
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:36,333
I'll catch it.

612
00:46:43,166 --> 00:46:46,666
Come on.

613
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,500
Come on.

614
00:47:07,583 --> 00:47:11,083
Call back. Darn it!

615
00:47:29,333 --> 00:47:32,083
Normally your phone keeps ringing all day.

616
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:36,083
Come on.

617
00:47:46,333 --> 00:47:50,541
Give me the phone.

618
00:47:51,041 --> 00:47:54,000
- Who do we call?
- Dial 911.

619
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:55,833
Really?

620
00:47:56,333 --> 00:47:59,833
Dial 911.

621
00:48:01,916 --> 00:48:06,125
Oh no. Out of network!

622
00:48:06,625 --> 00:48:07,785
What the hell are you doing?

623
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:11,125
Give me the phone.

624
00:48:11,625 --> 00:48:14,125
- Wait.
- Oh no!

625
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:16,625
- Stupid phone.
- Jeanine.

626
00:48:17,125 --> 00:48:18,333
- Give me the phone back.
- No.

627
00:48:18,833 --> 00:48:21,125
- There has be some network spot..
- No. You wait.

628
00:48:21,625 --> 00:48:23,541
- Stay away.
- Jeanine.

629
00:48:24,041 --> 00:48:27,666
Give me the phone.

630
00:48:28,166 --> 00:48:31,666
Give me the..

631
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:44,500
It's gone.

632
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,291
You witch.

633
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:48,958
Gunjan.

634
00:48:49,458 --> 00:48:50,500
You..

635
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:51,791
Jeanine.

636
00:48:52,291 --> 00:48:54,583
Stop it.

637
00:48:55,083 --> 00:48:57,458
You witch.

638
00:48:57,958 --> 00:49:00,833
Gu. What are you doing?

639
00:49:01,333 --> 00:49:02,166
Gunjan, enough.

640
00:49:02,666 --> 00:49:04,250
Have you lost your mind?

641
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:05,541
You witch.

642
00:49:06,041 --> 00:49:07,791
Let go. Jeanine.

643
00:49:08,291 --> 00:49:11,708
Jeanine.

644
00:49:12,208 --> 00:49:12,708
Jeanine.

645
00:49:13,125 --> 00:49:15,916
Jeanine.

646
00:49:16,416 --> 00:49:17,375
Jeanine!

647
00:49:17,875 --> 00:49:19,916
Jeanine!

648
00:49:20,416 --> 00:49:21,541
Jeanine!

649
00:49:22,041 --> 00:49:25,541
Jeanine!

650
00:49:31,708 --> 00:49:33,791
Oh no!

651
00:49:34,291 --> 00:49:37,833
Jeanine.

652
00:49:38,333 --> 00:49:38,875
Jeanine.

653
00:49:39,375 --> 00:49:42,875
Hold tight. Hold tight.

654
00:49:46,875 --> 00:49:50,375
- Not like this.
- Jeanine.

655
00:50:07,208 --> 00:50:10,708
Deepak.

656
00:50:23,333 --> 00:50:26,833
She's gone.

657
00:50:28,333 --> 00:50:30,583
No.

658
00:50:31,083 --> 00:50:33,375
No. No. No.

659
00:50:33,875 --> 00:50:37,291
How is it possible?

660
00:50:37,791 --> 00:50:41,125
Heart attack.

661
00:50:41,625 --> 00:50:43,958
But how did she suddenly..

662
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:45,541
Could be the alcohol?

663
00:50:46,041 --> 00:50:46,916
Alcohol?

664
00:50:47,416 --> 00:50:53,208
- Must have increased her heart-rate.
- Alcohol?

665
00:50:53,708 --> 00:50:58,333
I didn't mean to.

666
00:50:58,833 --> 00:51:00,750
- Guys.
- Gu.

667
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:05,708
- I didn't mean to.
- Gu. Gu. It's not your fault.

668
00:51:06,208 --> 00:51:09,708
Don't blame yourself.

669
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:45,250
Sarah.

670
00:51:47,416 --> 00:51:50,250
Sarah.

671
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:54,250
Sarah.

672
00:51:56,958 --> 00:52:00,458
Sarah.

673
00:52:16,041 --> 00:52:17,583
- Sarah.
- Sarah.

674
00:52:18,083 --> 00:52:19,500
Sarah.

675
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,833
Sarah.

676
00:52:22,333 --> 00:52:25,125
Sarah.

677
00:52:25,625 --> 00:52:29,333
Sarah.

678
00:52:29,833 --> 00:52:33,333
Sarah. Papa.

679
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,541
Mom and dad are right here.

680
00:52:46,041 --> 00:52:49,541
You will be fine.

681
00:52:54,458 --> 00:52:58,166
Sarah.

682
00:52:58,666 --> 00:53:02,166
Sarah.

683
00:53:11,875 --> 00:53:15,708
Sarah baby, no. Don't worry.

684
00:53:16,208 --> 00:53:17,916
Mom's right here.

685
00:53:18,416 --> 00:53:21,916
Baby.

686
00:53:36,125 --> 00:53:37,791
Anshu.

687
00:53:38,291 --> 00:53:42,250
Anshu, let her go.

688
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:44,833
Aman.

689
00:53:45,333 --> 00:53:48,833
But what was her mistake?

690
00:53:53,375 --> 00:53:56,875
Its no one's mistake.

691
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:03,250
Anshu, let her go.

692
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:09,000
Let her go.

693
00:54:10,541 --> 00:54:14,041
Good bye.

694
00:54:39,375 --> 00:54:43,166
Mama's right here, baby.

695
00:54:43,666 --> 00:54:46,125
Don't cry.

696
00:54:46,625 --> 00:54:48,666
Who's mama's strong girl?

697
00:54:49,166 --> 00:54:50,125
Who is it?

698
00:54:50,625 --> 00:54:52,208
Its okay, child.

699
00:54:52,708 --> 00:54:55,708
I'm coming.

700
00:54:56,208 --> 00:54:59,916
Don't worry.

701
00:55:00,416 --> 00:55:01,958
Sarah will be alright.

702
00:55:02,458 --> 00:55:04,791
Sarah will be alright.

703
00:55:05,291 --> 00:55:08,791
We will find a way.

704
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:25,250
Bakshi. What if no one comes?

705
00:55:34,083 --> 00:55:35,875
Can't we swim?

706
00:55:36,375 --> 00:55:38,708
To a near-by island or we
might run into someone.

707
00:55:39,208 --> 00:55:40,448
We might have a better chance.

708
00:55:40,708 --> 00:55:42,416
How far are we going to swim?

709
00:55:42,916 --> 00:55:46,416
There's nothing for miles.

710
00:55:48,416 --> 00:55:51,916
I'm worried.

711
00:55:54,875 --> 00:55:58,375
We're in deep trouble.

712
00:56:10,666 --> 00:56:12,416
Here! Over here!

713
00:56:12,916 --> 00:56:14,625
- Hey!
- Help.

714
00:56:15,125 --> 00:56:17,791
Help!

715
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:19,000
Help! Help!

716
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:20,583
Over here.

717
00:56:21,083 --> 00:56:22,250
Hold on!

718
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:25,791
Over here.

719
00:56:26,291 --> 00:56:27,916
Over here.

720
00:56:28,416 --> 00:56:29,833
We're saved. We're saved.

721
00:56:30,333 --> 00:56:31,125
I knew it.

722
00:56:31,625 --> 00:56:33,906
Didn't I tell you? Someone
will definitely pass this way.

723
00:56:34,291 --> 00:56:35,750
- Please help us.
- Help.

724
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:37,375
Help! Help!

725
00:56:37,875 --> 00:56:39,375
Help! Help!

726
00:56:39,875 --> 00:56:41,208
Help!

727
00:56:41,708 --> 00:56:42,416
Help!

728
00:56:42,916 --> 00:56:43,916
Help!

729
00:56:44,416 --> 00:56:47,916
Help!

730
00:56:49,625 --> 00:56:52,833
No. Stop.

731
00:56:53,333 --> 00:56:54,149
Help! Help!

732
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:04,375
Help!

733
00:57:06,916 --> 00:57:08,166
Help!

734
00:57:08,666 --> 00:57:12,166
Please help!

735
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:44,250
We'll make it.

736
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:53,000
We can try one thing.

737
00:58:07,958 --> 00:58:11,458
We can make a rope.

738
00:58:51,625 --> 00:58:55,125
Ready?

739
00:59:22,541 --> 00:59:26,583
Give me your goggles.

740
00:59:27,083 --> 00:59:30,583
I'll try to hook it on
the front anchor winch.

741
01:00:15,958 --> 01:00:19,458
Come on, boy!

742
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:28,250
Keep trying.

743
01:00:37,041 --> 01:00:40,541
Once more.

744
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:52,000
Damn!

745
01:01:21,208 --> 01:01:23,458
C'mon!

746
01:01:23,958 --> 01:01:24,791
Deepak, wait.

747
01:01:25,291 --> 01:01:29,041
Gu, you go.

748
01:01:29,541 --> 01:01:30,500
You're the lightest.

749
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,500
The rope's got more chances to hold.

750
01:01:55,166 --> 01:01:58,666
Come on

751
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:17,916
I'm getting a cramp.

752
01:03:19,708 --> 01:03:20,208
Sabi.

753
01:03:20,708 --> 01:03:22,500
Sabi, cramp.

754
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,166
Oh no! Bakshi.

755
01:03:25,666 --> 01:03:27,541
Bakshi. Are you okay?

756
01:03:28,041 --> 01:03:28,833
Aman.

757
01:03:29,333 --> 01:03:31,541
Please quickly get the clothes

758
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:35,541
Taran, look up.

759
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:43,416
Sabi, here.

760
01:03:47,375 --> 01:03:49,333
- I am okay.
- Help!

761
01:03:49,833 --> 01:03:51,416
I am okay.

762
01:03:51,916 --> 01:03:53,500
I was almost there.

763
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,500
Just a second more.

764
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:24,720
Did you see that?

765
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:25,720
Did you see that?

766
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:26,666
It was..

767
01:04:27,166 --> 01:04:30,416
It was next to me.

768
01:04:30,916 --> 01:04:33,083
It's the blood.

769
01:04:33,583 --> 01:04:35,223
It must have been attracted by the blood.

770
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:37,051
Everyone swim to the
other side of the yacht.

771
01:04:37,208 --> 01:04:38,666
Come on.

772
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:40,750
Yeti.

773
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:44,750
Where's Yeti?

774
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:53,916
No.

775
01:04:54,416 --> 01:04:58,291
- He's too far.
- No. Let me go.

776
01:04:58,791 --> 01:05:00,833
No. I will not.

777
01:05:01,333 --> 01:05:03,000
You won't go.

778
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:04,833
Guys, lets go.

779
01:05:05,333 --> 01:05:06,416
We have to move.

780
01:05:06,916 --> 01:05:07,997
- It will come back.
- Come.

781
01:05:08,375 --> 01:05:11,875
Come on.

782
01:05:13,041 --> 01:05:16,541
Come, Gu.

783
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:32,500
That was a shark that
touched Jeanine, right?

784
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:37,541
Everyone was already so scared.

785
01:05:38,041 --> 01:05:39,602
I didn't want to create anymore panic.

786
01:05:39,875 --> 01:05:41,750
Panic?

787
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:43,958
The blood attracted the shark.

788
01:05:44,458 --> 01:05:46,458
Otherwise it probably
wouldn't have come back.

789
01:05:46,958 --> 01:05:48,708
And were drifting as well.

790
01:05:49,208 --> 01:05:50,250
With the water current..

791
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:54,250
...must have drifted us at
least 10-20 miles away.

792
01:05:57,625 --> 01:06:01,125
Guys, I'm thirsty.

793
01:06:04,041 --> 01:06:06,833
Guys!

794
01:06:07,333 --> 01:06:10,833
I'm thirsty.

795
01:06:13,208 --> 01:06:15,958
Hang in, brother.

796
01:06:16,458 --> 01:06:19,958
Hang in there.

797
01:06:30,708 --> 01:06:35,541
"Gasps of breath.. breath
that fades away.."

798
01:06:36,041 --> 01:06:39,458
"..searches for the shore."

799
01:06:39,958 --> 01:06:45,000
"Gasps of moments.. through
the eyes of time.."

800
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:49,041
"..drop subtle hints."

801
01:06:49,541 --> 01:06:54,333
"Gasps of breath.. breath
that fades away.."

802
01:06:54,833 --> 01:06:58,250
"..searches for the shore."

803
01:06:58,750 --> 01:07:03,666
"Gasps of moments.. through
the eyes of time.."

804
01:07:04,166 --> 01:07:08,041
"..drop subtle hints."

805
01:07:08,541 --> 01:07:16,541
"The eyes offer no shimmer of
hope, my vision is blurred.."

806
01:07:17,833 --> 01:07:25,833
"The eyes offer no shimmer of
hope, my vision is blurred.."

807
01:07:26,833 --> 01:07:33,041
"Helpless.. how helpless.."

808
01:07:33,541 --> 01:07:38,708
"Why is life so helpless?"

809
01:07:39,208 --> 01:07:45,375
"Helpless.. how helpless.."

810
01:07:45,875 --> 01:07:49,375
"Why is life so helpless?"

811
01:08:24,041 --> 01:08:27,541
Help!

812
01:08:42,791 --> 01:08:46,416
Oh pretty dreams, come quietly.

813
01:08:46,916 --> 01:08:51,208
"And make my baby sleep."

814
01:08:51,708 --> 01:08:58,625
"From the lane of the moon."

815
01:08:59,125 --> 01:09:05,333
"From the road of stars."

816
01:09:05,833 --> 01:09:13,833
"Come quickly."

817
01:09:16,333 --> 01:09:19,500
"From the land of the fairies.."

818
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,583
"..and the court of dolls."

819
01:09:24,083 --> 01:09:30,750
"Take her through a journey of dreams."

820
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:37,541
"Oh pretty dreams, come quietly."

821
01:09:38,041 --> 01:09:44,750
"And make my baby sleep."

822
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:48,750
She's been crying for two hours.

823
01:09:52,208 --> 01:09:55,708
She can choke while crying.

824
01:10:02,708 --> 01:10:06,208
Why did you invite us here?

825
01:10:08,708 --> 01:10:09,958
Why?

826
01:10:10,458 --> 01:10:11,541
Why?

827
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:13,666
Who do you think you are?

828
01:10:14,166 --> 01:10:15,166
You think you're a stud?

829
01:10:15,333 --> 01:10:16,208
It's all your fault?

830
01:10:16,708 --> 01:10:19,583
It's all your fault?

831
01:10:20,083 --> 01:10:23,791
Why? Why?

832
01:10:24,291 --> 01:10:27,333
Deepak.

833
01:10:27,833 --> 01:10:31,333
Why?

834
01:10:34,083 --> 01:10:39,250
Please. Please.

835
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:41,375
Save my daughter.

836
01:10:41,875 --> 01:10:45,375
Save my daughter.

837
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:49,708
Sarah. Sabi. Sabi.

838
01:10:50,208 --> 01:10:51,583
Sarah will be fine.

839
01:10:52,083 --> 01:10:54,083
- Sarah will be fine.
- Sabi..

840
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:56,500
Sabi.. My child.

841
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,125
Sabi.. My child.

842
01:10:58,625 --> 01:11:03,500
Sabi.. My child.

843
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:04,708
Sabi.

844
01:11:05,208 --> 01:11:07,208
Sarah will be fine.

845
01:11:07,708 --> 01:11:11,208
She'll be fine.

846
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,416
Bakshi didn't call us here..

847
01:11:17,916 --> 01:11:21,416
Death did.

848
01:11:28,458 --> 01:11:30,500
Hey, Junkie.

849
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:37,000
You always said you'll
never leave hope and dope.

850
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:41,000
So what now?

851
01:11:43,875 --> 01:11:46,833
- What happened?
- Cramp.

852
01:11:47,333 --> 01:11:51,000
Cramp.

853
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:55,000
This yacht isn't mine.

854
01:12:02,791 --> 01:12:06,291
This yacht isn't mine.

855
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,500
Deora.

856
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:19,500
Yes.

857
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:24,166
I'm just a servant.

858
01:12:24,666 --> 01:12:27,583
I look after his property.

859
01:12:28,083 --> 01:12:31,583
- Baksh. It's okay.
- No. It's not okay.

860
01:12:35,833 --> 01:12:39,333
I am Taranjeet Singh Bakshi.

861
01:12:44,208 --> 01:12:46,208
I never lose.

862
01:12:46,708 --> 01:12:51,250
How could I lose?

863
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:55,250
How could I lose?

864
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,500
All my life I kept running.

865
01:13:03,833 --> 01:13:10,750
From my family, my friends.

866
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:14,750
From myself.

867
01:13:18,666 --> 01:13:21,416
When Anshul called..

868
01:13:21,916 --> 01:13:27,083
...I thought my life's calling me back.

869
01:13:27,583 --> 01:13:31,083
My love's calling me back.

870
01:13:34,583 --> 01:13:38,166
But how could I forget..

871
01:13:38,666 --> 01:13:41,500
First I lost my kin.

872
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,500
Then my dreams.

873
01:13:53,833 --> 01:13:58,750
I thought it's just a
matter of two-three days.

874
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:02,750
I'll be the old Bakshi again.

875
01:14:05,083 --> 01:14:08,583
And I was loving it.

876
01:14:11,541 --> 01:14:15,333
I am so sorry.

877
01:14:15,833 --> 01:14:18,458
I am so sorry, guys.

878
01:14:18,958 --> 01:14:22,458
I am so sorry.

879
01:14:24,333 --> 01:14:27,833
I am so sorry.

880
01:14:43,708 --> 01:14:44,833
Why?

881
01:14:45,333 --> 01:14:46,541
Why?

882
01:14:47,041 --> 01:14:48,083
Why?

883
01:14:48,583 --> 01:14:50,250
Why?

884
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:52,041
Why?

885
01:14:52,541 --> 01:14:55,375
Why?

886
01:14:55,875 --> 01:15:01,000
"When our paths met, and we walked along.."

887
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:07,791
"I stepped upon a storm."

888
01:15:08,291 --> 01:15:13,416
"It rained on the trees, such that.."

889
01:15:13,916 --> 01:15:20,208
"..the leaves fell off.."

890
01:15:20,708 --> 01:15:28,708
"These are the winds of
fate that turn us around."

891
01:15:30,041 --> 01:15:38,041
"The eyes offer no shimmer of
hope, my vision is blurred.."

892
01:15:39,083 --> 01:15:45,166
"Helpless.. how helpless.."

893
01:15:45,666 --> 01:15:50,916
"Why is life so helpless?"

894
01:15:51,416 --> 01:15:57,666
"Helpless.. how helpless.."

895
01:15:58,166 --> 01:16:01,666
"Why is life so helpless?"

896
01:16:17,041 --> 01:16:20,541
Deep.

897
01:16:26,333 --> 01:16:29,833
Deepak.

898
01:16:44,083 --> 01:16:45,708
Anshul's condition is really bad.

899
01:16:46,208 --> 01:16:49,708
He needs help.

900
01:16:54,166 --> 01:16:58,041
We all need help, Sabina.

901
01:16:58,541 --> 01:16:59,458
Deep?

902
01:16:59,958 --> 01:17:03,458
What can I do?

903
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:10,000
Right now..

904
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:14,500
...I'm only concerned about
my daughter's life.

905
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,541
She's our daughter, Deepak.

906
01:17:18,041 --> 01:17:20,750
And what do you want to say?

907
01:17:21,250 --> 01:17:24,750
Just say what you're thinking..

908
01:17:42,583 --> 01:17:44,083
Everyone come together

909
01:17:44,583 --> 01:17:45,333
Form a huddle.

910
01:17:45,833 --> 01:17:49,333
Now, guys!

911
01:17:59,083 --> 01:18:02,583
Closer. Closer.

912
01:18:04,875 --> 01:18:06,333
Sharks?

913
01:18:06,833 --> 01:18:10,333
Maybe.

914
01:18:26,166 --> 01:18:27,916
- Hold on.
- Hold on everyone.

915
01:18:28,416 --> 01:18:31,916
- Hold. Hold.
- Everyone stay together.

916
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,166
We're done for.

917
01:18:38,666 --> 01:18:39,541
Don't separate.

918
01:18:40,041 --> 01:18:44,125
The smaller the prey, the
sooner it'll pounce on you.

919
01:18:44,625 --> 01:18:45,666
If it heads towards us..

920
01:18:46,166 --> 01:18:48,833
...start thrashing your feet in the water.

921
01:18:49,333 --> 01:18:51,166
And scream.

922
01:18:51,666 --> 01:18:55,166
That might drive the shark away.

923
01:19:02,250 --> 01:19:03,083
Where?

924
01:19:03,583 --> 01:19:06,375
- Is it gone?
- No.

925
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:08,416
It's right there.

926
01:19:08,916 --> 01:19:10,875
How far?

927
01:19:11,375 --> 01:19:12,791
Just behind the boat.

928
01:19:13,291 --> 01:19:14,375
We're behind the boat.

929
01:19:14,875 --> 01:19:15,416
You mean in front of the boat.

930
01:19:15,916 --> 01:19:17,291
Gu, are you crazy?

931
01:19:17,791 --> 01:19:19,750
- Stop uttering nonsense.
- I don't care.

932
01:19:20,250 --> 01:19:20,750
Move.

933
01:19:21,041 --> 01:19:21,881
Move, I want to see.

934
01:19:22,375 --> 01:19:25,875
Move.

935
01:19:30,750 --> 01:19:32,375
- Bakshi.
- Yeah.

936
01:19:32,875 --> 01:19:35,083
Can it leave without attacking?

937
01:19:35,583 --> 01:19:40,625
It can. Depends on how hungry it is.

938
01:19:41,125 --> 01:19:42,125
Is it the same shark?

939
01:19:42,625 --> 01:19:43,166
What difference does that make?

940
01:19:43,666 --> 01:19:45,750
- Do you plan to adopt it?
- No.

941
01:19:46,250 --> 01:19:47,958
Because if it came back..

942
01:19:48,458 --> 01:19:51,291
...then it's here to feed. Right, Bakshi?

943
01:19:51,791 --> 01:19:54,583
Yes, most probably.

944
01:19:55,083 --> 01:19:58,916
Guys.

945
01:19:59,416 --> 01:20:03,166
I'm nearly finished anyways.

946
01:20:03,666 --> 01:20:07,500
I can't swim anymore.

947
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,666
Feed me to the shark.

948
01:20:10,166 --> 01:20:13,083
At least he'll have a stomach full.

949
01:20:13,583 --> 01:20:15,083
Shut up, Fatty.

950
01:20:15,583 --> 01:20:18,541
Nothing will happen to anyone.

951
01:20:19,041 --> 01:20:22,541
Where did it go?

952
01:20:49,250 --> 01:20:52,750
Help!

953
01:21:33,041 --> 01:21:36,500
Now?

954
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,125
Hope that the shark leaves.

955
01:21:40,625 --> 01:21:43,958
Sharks are not used to trying too hard.

956
01:21:44,458 --> 01:21:47,958
They always look for an easy prey.

957
01:22:14,125 --> 01:22:15,750
Is it gone?

958
01:22:16,250 --> 01:22:19,750
It can come back?

959
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:56,500
Plane.

960
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,500
Guys.

961
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:04,500
Plane.

962
01:23:05,666 --> 01:23:08,250
Help. Look here.

963
01:23:08,750 --> 01:23:12,250
Please.

964
01:23:14,375 --> 01:23:14,875
Help.

965
01:23:20,708 --> 01:23:24,666
We're stuck!

966
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:27,458
Look here!

967
01:23:27,958 --> 01:23:29,791
Anshul.

968
01:23:30,291 --> 01:23:32,666
Anshul. Come to your senses.

969
01:23:33,166 --> 01:23:34,326
Anshul. Come to your senses.

970
01:23:34,625 --> 01:23:36,458
Come to your senses.

971
01:23:36,958 --> 01:23:39,666
Come to your senses.

972
01:23:40,166 --> 01:23:46,666
"Who knows who are their senses.."

973
01:23:47,166 --> 01:23:52,666
"..what is being out of senses."

974
01:23:53,166 --> 01:23:59,000
"Come fall in love, and know.."

975
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:03,833
"Come fall in love, and know.."

976
01:24:04,333 --> 01:24:07,833
"..what life is.."

977
01:24:11,541 --> 01:24:13,416
Anshul.

978
01:24:13,916 --> 01:24:17,416
Anshul?

979
01:24:32,375 --> 01:24:35,875
Anshul?

980
01:24:37,125 --> 01:24:38,250
Fatty!

981
01:24:38,750 --> 01:24:41,041
Fatty!

982
01:24:41,541 --> 01:24:44,583
Fatty!

983
01:24:45,083 --> 01:24:49,166
Fatty, get up!

984
01:24:49,666 --> 01:24:51,291
Anshul.

985
01:24:51,791 --> 01:24:52,583
Fatty!

986
01:24:53,083 --> 01:24:54,458
Fatty, get up!

987
01:24:54,958 --> 01:24:56,333
Fatty, look, look, look.

988
01:24:56,833 --> 01:24:58,208
Look at the girl.

989
01:24:58,708 --> 01:24:59,541
Girl.

990
01:25:00,041 --> 01:25:01,791
Fatty, look.

991
01:25:02,291 --> 01:25:03,666
Take a look.

992
01:25:04,166 --> 01:25:07,458
Take a look. Get up.

993
01:25:07,958 --> 01:25:10,166
He's not breathing.

994
01:25:10,666 --> 01:25:14,166
He's not breathing.

995
01:25:15,750 --> 01:25:18,666
Anshul.

996
01:25:19,166 --> 01:25:21,041
Not like this, fatty. Not like this.

997
01:25:21,541 --> 01:25:22,941
- Come on, open your eyes.
- Anshul.

998
01:25:23,375 --> 01:25:24,458
Nothing's wrong with you.

999
01:25:24,958 --> 01:25:25,875
Open your eyes.

1000
01:25:26,375 --> 01:25:27,875
Anshul. Anshul.

1001
01:25:28,375 --> 01:25:30,166
Look, everyone's waiting for you.

1002
01:25:30,666 --> 01:25:32,041
Won't you have fritters?

1003
01:25:32,541 --> 01:25:33,541
Get up, get up, come on.

1004
01:25:33,916 --> 01:25:35,166
Get up. Get up. Come on.

1005
01:25:35,666 --> 01:25:37,625
Get up, you're absolutely fine.

1006
01:25:38,125 --> 01:25:41,125
- Fatty.
- Get up.

1007
01:25:41,625 --> 01:25:44,250
You can't say no to me.

1008
01:25:44,750 --> 01:25:46,416
Come on, get up. That's enough.

1009
01:25:46,916 --> 01:25:50,875
He's not breathing.

1010
01:25:51,375 --> 01:25:52,250
Get up, fatty.

1011
01:25:52,750 --> 01:25:54,958
Just get up. You're absolutely fine.

1012
01:25:55,458 --> 01:25:56,658
We'll head straight for home.

1013
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,291
We'll go home.

1014
01:25:58,791 --> 01:25:59,751
We'll go home together.

1015
01:25:59,958 --> 01:26:02,000
Come on, just get up. Just get up.

1016
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:06,041
Just get up.

1017
01:26:06,541 --> 01:26:10,041
Aman.

1018
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,375
Guys, let's go. We've to move.

1019
01:26:14,875 --> 01:26:18,291
It will come back. Come on.

1020
01:26:18,791 --> 01:26:22,291
Now, guys.

1021
01:27:13,916 --> 01:27:17,416
What now?

1022
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:23,791
Just like the sun..

1023
01:27:24,291 --> 01:27:27,791
...we'll all go down one by one.

1024
01:27:33,250 --> 01:27:35,958
I have to try.

1025
01:27:36,458 --> 01:27:39,958
You won't make it.

1026
01:27:45,041 --> 01:27:49,000
Tell that to Anshul.

1027
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:53,000
I can't wait for my end to come.

1028
01:28:01,750 --> 01:28:03,000
Gu.

1029
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:07,000
Wait.

1030
01:28:12,125 --> 01:28:15,625
Stopping me again, Aman.

1031
01:28:17,875 --> 01:28:21,375
Won't you wait for me?

1032
01:29:27,583 --> 01:29:32,625
"On the waves, my eyes search.."

1033
01:29:33,125 --> 01:29:39,541
"..for a piece of land."

1034
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:45,166
"The warmth of the setting sun.."

1035
01:29:45,666 --> 01:29:52,041
"..offers a glimpse of hope."

1036
01:29:52,541 --> 01:30:00,541
"My fear has worn out, I've
set my sight on the skies."

1037
01:30:01,916 --> 01:30:09,916
"The eyes offer no shimmer of
hope, my vision is blurred.."

1038
01:30:10,750 --> 01:30:16,958
"Helpless.. how helpless.."

1039
01:30:17,458 --> 01:30:22,791
"Why is life so helpless?"

1040
01:30:23,291 --> 01:30:29,416
"Helpless.. how helpless.."

1041
01:30:29,916 --> 01:30:33,416
"Why is life so helpless?"

1042
01:31:19,083 --> 01:31:20,458
Sabi.

1043
01:31:20,958 --> 01:31:22,708
Deepak.

1044
01:31:23,208 --> 01:31:26,708
This way.

1045
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:32,750
Deepak.

1046
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:39,500
- Deepak.
- Where did I go wrong, Sabina?

1047
01:31:57,375 --> 01:32:00,875
Where did I go wrong, Sabina?

1048
01:32:04,791 --> 01:32:10,416
Until now, everything I did..

1049
01:32:10,916 --> 01:32:14,416
Was for my kin.

1050
01:32:21,083 --> 01:32:24,583
Then why is this happening to us?

1051
01:32:33,750 --> 01:32:35,458
Is this our end?

1052
01:32:35,958 --> 01:32:38,875
No.

1053
01:32:39,375 --> 01:32:39,875
This..

1054
01:32:44,041 --> 01:32:47,875
Deepak.

1055
01:32:48,375 --> 01:32:51,875
We cannot lose hope.

1056
01:32:54,958 --> 01:32:57,166
You are our strength.

1057
01:32:57,666 --> 01:32:59,500
I can't.

1058
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,960
- We cannot lose hope.
- I can't, Sabina. I can't.

1059
01:33:02,333 --> 01:33:04,041
- I can't.
- Deepak.

1060
01:33:04,541 --> 01:33:05,458
We won't survive.

1061
01:33:05,958 --> 01:33:08,500
- We cannot lose hope.
- It's hopeless.

1062
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,250
We won't survive, Sabina.

1063
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:12,500
We won't survive.

1064
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:16,500
We won't survive either.

1065
01:33:18,958 --> 01:33:20,041
Sarah.

1066
01:33:20,541 --> 01:33:24,875
Sarah, no.

1067
01:33:25,375 --> 01:33:27,458
Why did we come here?

1068
01:33:27,958 --> 01:33:29,875
Baby!

1069
01:33:30,375 --> 01:33:31,976
This is the demon who caused everything.

1070
01:33:32,458 --> 01:33:35,958
It's this.

1071
01:33:39,666 --> 01:33:40,500
Deepak, no!

1072
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:44,500
Deepak, control yourself.

1073
01:33:48,583 --> 01:33:52,083
Deepak..

1074
01:33:54,166 --> 01:33:55,666
Why? Why?

1075
01:33:56,166 --> 01:33:57,541
Why? Why? Why?

1076
01:33:58,041 --> 01:34:00,583
- Deepak, control yourself.
- Why? Why?

1077
01:34:01,083 --> 01:34:04,458
- Why?
- Enough.

1078
01:34:04,958 --> 01:34:06,500
You're hurt.

1079
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,125
By hurting yourself you won't save Sarah

1080
01:34:09,625 --> 01:34:12,875
I know..

1081
01:34:13,375 --> 01:34:14,833
Who you are concerned about?

1082
01:34:15,333 --> 01:34:16,708
Why?

1083
01:34:17,208 --> 01:34:19,791
Whom are you concerned about?

1084
01:34:20,291 --> 01:34:22,583
Why?

1085
01:34:23,083 --> 01:34:26,583
Why?

1086
01:34:37,375 --> 01:34:40,875
No.

1087
01:34:43,708 --> 01:34:47,208
No.

1088
01:35:00,458 --> 01:35:03,958
Sabina!

1089
01:35:17,291 --> 01:35:20,791
Come on. - Come on. Come on. - Come on.

1090
01:35:23,958 --> 01:35:25,319
Why did you throw your life-vest?

1091
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:29,000
The shark was heading straight for you.

1092
01:35:33,416 --> 01:35:34,166
We're dead!

1093
01:35:34,666 --> 01:35:36,666
We're dead!

1094
01:35:37,166 --> 01:35:38,083
We've a chance.

1095
01:35:38,583 --> 01:35:42,083
But we have to hurry.

1096
01:36:19,083 --> 01:36:22,583
Sabi, come on.

1097
01:36:35,833 --> 01:36:37,541
Sabi. Come on.

1098
01:36:38,041 --> 01:36:41,541
Come on, Sabi.

1099
01:37:10,583 --> 01:37:14,000
Come on, Sabi.

1100
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:18,000
Yeah.

1101
01:37:26,291 --> 01:37:29,791
Hurry up, Sabi.

1102
01:37:52,833 --> 01:37:56,333
Deepak. Taran, quickly!

1103
01:38:03,583 --> 01:38:08,125
Deepak. Come on.

1104
01:38:08,625 --> 01:38:12,125
Come on, Deepak.

1105
01:38:24,041 --> 01:38:26,416
Guys.

1106
01:38:26,916 --> 01:38:28,166
Deepak.

1107
01:38:28,666 --> 01:38:32,166
Come fast.

1108
01:38:42,458 --> 01:38:46,041
Give your hand.

1109
01:38:46,541 --> 01:38:50,041
No!

1110
01:39:06,375 --> 01:39:09,875
Taran. Sabi.

1111
01:39:16,916 --> 01:39:18,500
No!

1112
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:22,500
No!

1113
01:39:41,291 --> 01:39:44,791
Sarah.

1114
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,791
Sarah. Sarah.

1115
01:39:57,291 --> 01:40:00,791
Sarah, baby. Come on, baby.

1116
01:40:07,166 --> 01:40:08,583
Sarah. Sarah.

1117
01:40:09,083 --> 01:40:12,583
Sarah, baby.

1118
01:40:20,208 --> 01:40:23,708
Sarah.

1119
01:40:27,333 --> 01:40:30,833
Sarah.

1120
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:47,500
My baby.

1121
01:41:21,333 --> 01:41:24,833
I am sorry, Sabina.

1122
01:41:26,416 --> 01:41:29,916
I don't know what happened to me.

1123
01:41:36,583 --> 01:41:40,083
Did you wish Sarah?

1124
01:41:57,333 --> 01:42:00,916
Happy birthday baby.

1125
01:42:01,416 --> 01:42:02,541
Yeti.

1126
01:42:03,041 --> 01:42:06,541
- Yeti.
- Yeti.

1127
01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:12,083
Listen.

1128
01:42:12,583 --> 01:42:16,083
Did you find anyone else?

1129
01:43:20,791 --> 01:43:24,291
"A cold fear grips me..
My breath trembles.."

1130
01:43:40,625 --> 01:43:46,541
"A cold fear grips me..
My breath trembles.."

1131
01:43:47,041 --> 01:43:53,083
"My life is on tenterhooks!"

1132
01:43:53,583 --> 01:43:59,708
"Neither there's no hope, nor land."

1133
01:44:00,208 --> 01:44:06,250
"A cold fear grips me..
My breath trembles.."

1134
01:44:06,750 --> 01:44:11,750
"Even the gods don't seem to
be around, where will you go?"

1135
01:44:12,250 --> 01:44:19,166
"Warning.. Warning.."

1136
01:44:19,666 --> 01:44:25,250
"Coincidentally, danger's looking for you."

1137
01:44:25,750 --> 01:44:32,333
"Warning.. Warning.."

1138
01:44:32,833 --> 01:44:36,333
"Coincidentally, danger's looking for you."

1139
01:45:19,166 --> 01:45:25,375
"Every wave comes with renewed
strength, a silent noise engulfs."

1140
01:45:25,875 --> 01:45:29,375
"What is this danger, I'm clueless.."

1141
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:45,000
"We were left pleading, we
endured what we didn't have to."

1142
01:45:45,500 --> 01:45:51,875
"I yearn repeatedly for help,
but there's none around."

1143
01:45:52,375 --> 01:45:55,083
"My heart is afraid, my body tired.."

1144
01:45:55,583 --> 01:45:58,708
"All that's left is a little courage."

1145
01:45:59,208 --> 01:46:07,208
"I don't know what's the nature of time."

1146
01:46:08,458 --> 01:46:13,750
"The depth gradually deepens."

1147
01:46:14,250 --> 01:46:20,833
"Warning.. Warning.."

1148
01:46:21,333 --> 01:46:26,708
"Coincidentally, danger's looking for you."

1149
01:46:27,208 --> 01:46:34,000
"Warning.. Warning.."

1150
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:42,500
"Coincidentally, danger's looking for you."
