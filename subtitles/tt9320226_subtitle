00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,310
Hi Sameera!
You're the State topper of PU exams.

2
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,760
We're proud of you!
Congratulations!

3
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:36,270
Sir?

4
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,150
We've to follow the procedure.
The police are here.

5
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,220
Please sir.

6
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,870
If you educate a woman,
you educate a family.

7
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,100
Hereafter,
your daughter's my responsibility.

8
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:59,290
She topped her 10th
and 12th exams.

9
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,790
How can she fail
this entrance exam?!

10
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,680
No! A re-evaluation has to be done.

11
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,280
Hit it, Harischandra!

12
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,000
Party hard!

13
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,710
The Chairman of RNC group!

14
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,180
His college has topped the
KCET results this year.

15
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,750
Congratulations brother!

16
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:04,780
Take a look!

17
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,430
Look how cheerfully my
college students are dancing.

18
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,650
They believe private colleges
are their Holy Shrine.

19
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,170
And treat us - the ones who run
the colleges, as their Gods.

20
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:16,150
Their parents end up selling
everything they own and pledge their

21
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:19,630
...hard-earned gold to pay for the
college fees and donation money.

22
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,470
Even if a Government college offers free
education, none of them will take it up.

23
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,230
All they want is a college building,
hi-fi infrastructure and hi-fi crowd.

24
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,440
In India, it's not the
educated who are clever.

25
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,440
It's us, the educators,
who are the geniuses.

26
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,710
The Medical and Engineering
sectors have seen its boom.

27
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,740
Let's get the Commerce
sector booming!

28
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:42,620
How long will the Medical and
Engineering students rake all the moolah?

29
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,640
Let our commerce students
too have some fun.

30
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,310
[IN UNSION] We want justice!

31

[NEWS REPORT] Government colleges
protest against the K-CET board.

32
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,510
Pressure builds to re-evaluate the exam
papers of Government college students.

33
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:01,400
The board isn't responsible if Government
colleges protest to hide their failures.

34
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,950
People believe you're highlighting
this incident because the

35
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,130
...deceased is a Muslim girl.
What do you have to say?

36
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,410
Only our college application forms
have sections for Religion and caste.

37
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,550
Once selected,
all the students are equal.

38
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,820
Our religion is India.
Our caste is Kannada.

39
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:19,020

Hello Sir.

44
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:34,330
You're the DC of Bangalore.

45
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,100
What's your reason to
support this strike?

46
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,120
I'm in an esteemed position
in this country and society.

47
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,000
I studied in a
Government college too.

48
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,330
R K University.

49
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:46,970
Government colleges have shaped the
lives of millions of students like me.

50
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:50,040
I have a request to make to the
board on behalf of the students.

51
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,890
This paper needs to be re-evaluated
in presence of the University panel.

52
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:59,310
WE WANT JUSTICE!
RADHAKRISHNA, DOWN DOWN!

53
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,490
This is a sensitive matter.

54
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,010
I'm aware of it.

55
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,190
It wasn't just your college
student who suffered.

56
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,480
Many students across entire
Karnataka's Government Aided

57
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,160
...and Unaided colleges
have attempted suicide.

58
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,670
Sameera was unfortunate.

59
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,980
If students from other colleges
in the state sign the petition

60
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,130
...along with your students,
I can take it forward.

61
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,970
It's not just your college
that is facing the brunt.

62
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,230
What say, DC sir?

63
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,000
Madam, the law has the same to
say, right?

64
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,370
This protest is not only for
the students of our college.

65
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,900
This protest is for each and every
student of this state and country.

66
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,970
We will do it sir.
Thank you.

67

Thank you sir.
- You've my support too. Thank you.

68
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,630
Mr. Jaipal...

69
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:54,050
I'm reaching out to all the Colleges and
Universities in the state personally,

70
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,800
...for the cause of injustice that
Sameera and other students faced

71
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,350
...and I'm seeking their support
for my petition against it.

72
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,460
I'll make sure I
garner all the support.

73
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,480
Until then,
this college is your responsibility.

74
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:07,060
By the way, don't stop the 50th
anniversary celebrations of R K University.

75
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,210
Students should move on
from the Sameera incident.

76
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,140
A positive atmosphere
needs to be created.

77
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,970
Yes sir.
- Take care.

78
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,950
Your college shouldn't
sign this petition.

79
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,000
Okay sir.

80
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,930
Stop your students...
- Yes sir.

81
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,070
Or else,
I'm going to shut your college.

82
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,120
Students,
we have orders from the management.

83
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,920
Our college should not
sign this petition.

84
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,890
Sir, what if our students face
the same situation in the future?

85
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,290
You cannot go against the college.

86
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,170
Not happening sir.
We will sign this.

87
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,540
[IN UNSION] WE WILL SIGN THIS!

88
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,870
Hello? Sir...

89
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,190
Don't beat him!

90
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,600
Don't force us to turn this
college into a burial ground.

91
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,800
I'm warning you!

92
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,160
Brother, hear me out!

93
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,550
He's not like others.
He's not the one to be messed with.

94
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,720
I knew there was a
lighthouse in Mangaluru.

95
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,560
Only today, did I learn that
there's a Powerhouse too!

96
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,380
He's come looking for us,
to this very port.

97
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,930
He's a Monster!

98
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,620
A MONSTER!

99
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,080
Setu!

100
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,820
He was right here.
Keep moving!

101
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,450
He must be around.
- Comb the entire port.

102
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,340
Where is he?!
- He was right here...

103
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,050
Must have chickened out!
- A coward!

104
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,960
How dare you mess with us?!

105
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,530
You think you can enter our
world, and intimidate us?!

106
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,610
There are three kinds
of men in this world!

107
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,490
The one who follows the rules.
The one who breaks the rules.

108
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,110
And I'm of the third kind...

109
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,290
The one who rules!

110
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,470
I came here to tell you not to
mess with my college students.

111
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,280
Your friend went
straight for my collar.

112
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,730
One shouldn't dare touch a
woman's skirt and a man's collar.

113
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,960
He broke that rule.
And I broke him!

114
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:12,330
Brace yourself to face a
Tsunami that will destroy you.

115
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,170
The Tsunami took form
in the sea long ago.

116
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,340
You're late!

117
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,600
It's none of your business to get
involved in administrative matters!

118
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,220
How dare you go against
the college's decision?

119
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,950
Once I take a stand on
something, I stay put.

120
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,420
I don't swerve from my path.

121
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,670
Because both the circuit
and the ride's mine.

122
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,660
Let a Ferrari come by,
and I won't give a damn.

123
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,660
The students were warned for against
the college. What's wrong in that?

124
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,770
I too warned them for getting
physical with my boys.

125
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:14,800
What's wrong in that?

126
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,520
You're rusticated
from this college.

127
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,010
I'm glad you said it.

128
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,600
Even my boys won't set foot
in a lacklustre place like this.

129
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,960
And you think,
I'm going to stay?

130
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,040
Heâ€™s a brand,
donâ€™t you dare stop him in his way

131
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,850
Heâ€™s an explosion that wonâ€™t
stop roaring; move aside

132
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,170
He needs no one to
keep surging forward

133
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:20,500
For no one can rival
this unstoppable force

134
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,440
Donâ€™t you dare flaunt your guts

135
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,150
Donâ€™t you try to intimidate him

136
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,630
Donâ€™t you lose control
and mess with him

137
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,960
Remember, I watch in
silence while I keep smiling

138
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:34,300

No matter who it is,

No matter who wins,
he stands tall

ever wipe off your legacy

but is the ultimate Showman

unfading as it burns on

00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:40,910
...especially into R K University.

173
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:42,470
They should blend in
with the students,

174
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:44,580
...divert them from studies
and disrupt their lives.

175
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:47,370
You need to lead this gang
and I need daily updates.

176
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,200
Yes sir.
- All the best boys!

177
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,330
How's the Josh?
- High sir!

178
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,860
Don't be a bunch
of goody two shoes.

179
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,890
Get wicked!

180
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:56,100
Only when I turned wicked,
did I make it big. Remember?

181
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,560
Principal's busy.

182
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,320
He won't be able to meet you.
Please leave.

183
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,050
What?!
I've been waiting for two hours!

[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

185
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:12,020
Excuse me? Sir!
This is a social cause.

186
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,470
The petition needs to be signed.
You have to support this.

187
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:16,240
How much are you making
from this campaign?

188
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,520
How can you exploit the death of a
girl to save your college's reputation?

189
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,370
We haven't lost any of
our college students.

190
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,690
We have clear instructions
not to support this cause!

191
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,910
I'll let you know when one of ours dies.
You may...

192
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,300
How dare you talk
to me like this?

193
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,470
You're playing around with
the lives of students.

194
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:33,040
We're inside a college. Please come.
- You...!

195
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,970
It's okay. Let's calm down.
- Cowards!

196
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:37,530
Sir, let's leave from here.
- They've sold their souls!

197
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:42,130
You didn't just teach
lessons to students like me.

198
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,230
You guided us.

199
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,790
You imparted confidence
along with knowledge.

200
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,570
They say that one should have a goal
ahead, and a Guru behind.

201
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,220
And you are one
such righteous Guru.

202
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,120
You've helped all of
us reach our goals.

203
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,380
You will reach your goal too.

204
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,120
Your students stand by you.

205
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:00,120
You and our college are
role models to the world.

206
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,620
Be brave and push ahead!

207
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,230
Jai Hind! Take care.
- Thank you.

208
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:09,650
Bruce Lee, get some men from
Mangaluru for our operations.

209
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:11,240
I've informed Shetty about it.

210
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,430
One of his men has come
down with a contract!

211
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,660
Get him admitted to R K University.

212
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,890
Lo and behold the Ruler!

213
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,230
Sri Sri Ranadheera Kanteerava!

214
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,660
Looks like he's
taken after Annavaru.

215
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,930
Sir?
- Silence!

216
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:35,920
I shall never hide and fight the war!

217
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:40,630
Twenty five lambs are here
to assassinate a lone Lion!

218
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,020
Your Highness!
- Yes?!

219
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,300
Don't lose your temper.
- Is that so?!

220
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:53,410
Sir, the mace is coming in
contact with another mace!

221
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,660
Is she supposed to be the Queen?

222
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,350
And does he look like an Emperor?

00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,770
[MUFFLED MUMBLE]

224
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,350
Why does the Queen look like that?

225
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,950
How else will the
Aaya (helper) look?

226
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,020
The Aaya in her isn't
prepared to be the Queen.

227
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,300
Look at her in that blue saree.

228
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,370
No wonder you found out.

229
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:11,910
This play is being put up
by the non-teaching staff.

230
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,390
The Admin's the Emperor.
The Aaya's the Queen.

231
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,380
The security guards
are the doorkeepers.

232
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,810
Lab technicians and Hostel
wardens are the Ministers.

233
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,550
And who's the director
of this wretched play?

234
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,020
I am...

235
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,910
The computer science lecturer.

236
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:30,230
Oy' Queen!
Get rid of the blue saree!

237
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,880
Get rid of it.
- Fine.

238
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:35,560
Sir, a guy has come
looking for you.

239
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,600
You there,
tell him what the matter is!

240
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,780
Talk respectfully.

241
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:41,070
I'll deal with him.
Get going from here!

242
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:42,780
Take a hike! Move!

243
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:45,000
Who are you, Sire?
- My name's Arjun.

244
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,400
I'm the son of College
Librarian Govind's friend.

245
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,690
I wanted to join the
Seventh semester.

246
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,760
Heard your Vice-Principal
has given the go ahead.

247
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,070
Speaking of high influence, huh?

248
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,290
This college is running
on recommendations.

249
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,070
It has gone to the dogs after
admitting every tom, dick and harry!

250
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:59,130
Move!

251
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,510
Lord Kanteerava!
Come along.

252
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:05,050
I wanted to know a few
things about this college.

253
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,230
Somebody call the Opponent King.

254
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:13,150
He wishes to get a look at the college.
Take him around.

255
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,000
And him?
- The Peon!

256
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,430
This is the degree block.

257
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,240
No one's paying heed inside
or bothering on the outside.

258
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,860
This is the Engineering block.

259
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,030
Long ago,
Engineers would travel in cabs.

260
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,530
Now,
they drive passengers in them.

261
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:28,440
All thanks to Corona.
- Looks like he's new to college.

262
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:29,820
Stop right there.

263
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,230
Go on. Keep moving.

264
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:35,920
Didn't I tell you?

265
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,610
Dude, let's mess around a bit.

266
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:44,690
This is the Library!
- When did I call it a Mortuary?

267
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,960
Keep walking.

268
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,910
The smoke's already
in your lungs. Go on.

269
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:51,730
They're all defective pieces.
All thanks to addictive vices.

270
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,220
Refer this until the
new book arrives.

271
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,250
That is the medical block.
They're the ones who slit and rip us off.

272
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:08,930
That is the auditorium.

273
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,050
Medical students are practising
dance for the 50th year celebrations.

274
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,450
You've no use from it.
Let's go.

275
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,830
I'll take a look and
decide how useful it is.

276
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,850
What does Choli mean?
- Choli's a blouse.

277
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,590
Chunari's a skirt.
- Did I ask you?

278
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,340
Who is she?
- The Doctor.

279
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,100
And I'm her Patient.

280
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,790
Your song's superb.
Your dance's superb.

281
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:13,900
Your grace's superb and
your troop is superb too.

282
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:16,450
But the groom doesn't have
the very necessary thing.

283
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:17,740
Huh?!

284
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,380
He's expressionless.

285
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,400
Either change the song
or change your partner.

286
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,070
And who are you
to tell us that?!

287
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,890
The Supreme Fan!

288
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,570
Dude, share a cigarette with me.

289
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:37,300
Take off your damn shirt!
- Stoop down! Squat!

290
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,280
What are you staring at?
- I'll smack you!

291
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,460
Sir, please let us go.

292
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:44,030
Ankith, your Madhu's here.
- Madhu!

293
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,890
I'm not Madhu.
I'm Mahesh.

294
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:48,750
You're my Madhu!
- I'm Mahesh. Not your Madhu.

295
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,660
Hand me the grass!

296
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,850
Sir, please let me go!

297
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,870
You! Come here.

298
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,650
Have you watched Om?

299
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,100
We were the ones who produced it.

300
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,270
Huh?

301
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:06,960
You guys are lingering around the entry
scene, I've already made it to the climax.

302
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,930
I'm a fan of Sathya too.

303
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,000
Do you have a long
(machete) with you?

304
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,740
Do you have one?

305
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:14,920
Here, take it back.

306
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,780
Let's go.
- Madhu!

307
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:18,100
The torn underwear's mine.

308
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,000
The faded one's mine.
- Madhu?

309
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,860
Thank you brother.
- Keep moving.

310
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,960
Please sir.
I desperately need it.

311
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,160
Desperate for the stuff, huh?

312
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,520
There you go.
Go have fun!

313
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,670
Give me some.

314
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,110
Get some corner seats in a cinema
and stay away from classes.

315
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,430
Who's next?

316
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,460
New admission?

317
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,290
Attending classes is prohibited.

318
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,520
What will you take?
Cash or Dope?

319
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:50,460
Does he look like
a dope head to you?

320
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:51,740
Take it!

321
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,040
What are you doing?!

322
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,760
Hand me ten thousand bucks
and I'll have some fun.

323
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:58,870
Five hundred bucks doesn't
even cover my OLA, UBER ride.

324
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,040
Sir?
- Hmmm?

325
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,320
Go ahead with the class, sir.
- Are you new here?

326
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,660
I can't conduct the lecture
for only fifteen of you.

327
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,290
Don't we count as students to you?

328
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,380
I'll teach them at
my coaching Center.

329
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,340
You can join them.
I'll coach you too.

330
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,190
I've paid for the college lectures.
Not for a coaching class.

331
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,850
Clearly you need the
lessons more than I do.

332
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:30,590
I will not be taking the class.
Do whatever you want.

333
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:34,750
Fantastic!
- It will be, sir.

334
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:38,580
Doesn't this college allow a lecture if
there are only fifteen students in a class?

335
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:39,850
Give me two minutes.

336
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:43,260
I'll finish the cultural
meeting and attend to you. Okay?

337
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,440
Excuse me?

338
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:49,000
How are the preparations for
the Golden Jubilee coming along?

339
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,310
It's going well, sir.

340
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,000
We'll need the
funds sooner though.

341
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:55,410
Funds will take time.
Manage until then.

342
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:58,410
Feel free to give them the donation
money I paid along with the fees.

343
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,110
Wait for two minutes.

344
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,320
The programs should go well.

345
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:05,880
And each program should
be unique, okay?

346
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,210
Sure sir.

347
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:09,830
Who is this guy?

348
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:13,800
Will there be no lecture if there
are only fifteen students in a class?

349
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,930
Who told you that?
- The Thermodynamics Lecturer.

350
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,140
Murali Manohar.

351
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:20,860
Look, he's a senior lecturer.
And you're new here.

352
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:23,030
Have some patience!
- What's all this sir?

353
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:25,030
Do we have to explain
ourselves to a student?

354
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:26,890
He'll stay if he wishes to...

355
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:29,050
Or else, he is free to leave.

356
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,130
Mister!

357
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:32,650
I'll talk to him.
You may leave now.

358
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,620
Hurry up sir. Or else I'll
have to go looking for him.

359
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,940
Excuse me?

360
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,110
You seem familiar to me.

361
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,170
Do you live in Basavanagudi?

362
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,950
Nah. More like Gandhadagudi.

363
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,280
I'll see you sir.

364
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,790
Keep an eye on him.

365
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,610
He seems like a troublemaker.

366
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:55,020
Hi...
- Hey!

367
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:58,470
I thought of having a chat with
you in the Vice-Principal's room.

368
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,560
Then I got thinking.

369
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,790
What if you threw attitude,
in turn hurting my ego

370
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,950
...and pissing me off?
So only the social distancing.

371
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,220
Did you change the song?
- Oh, we didn't.

372
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,100
Got rid of the partner itself.

373
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,530
You're very straightforward.

374
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,870
You don't hold back
anything, right?

375
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,270
All I do is talk.

376
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,160
Are you an Engineering student?
- Yep...

377
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,840
I'm a...
- You don't have to say it.

378
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:20,150
Your appearance tells me
you're a medical student.

379
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,420
You look like a capsule.

380
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,870
What is this guy even?

381
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,010
Don't you want my phone number?

382
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,380
I'm not the one to flirt
or fall for someone.

383
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,030
Be careful. Bye.

384
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,940
Looks like a Demigod
on the outside.

385
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,850
But is clearly an Osama
Bin Laden on the inside.

386
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,290
I'm sorry bro.

387
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,910
Move it!

388
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:03,730
Move away!

389
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,410
Why is he here?

390
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,430
Sit.

391
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:27,640
Bro, I'll get out of here.
- Sit down!

392
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:28,970
If you say so, bro.

393
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:32,620
Brother,
I came here for that very reason.

394
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:34,730
I was here even
before you came by.

395
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,560
That is all I know.

396
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:38,520
I thought it was a good deal.

397
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,990
I had no idea you were involved.

398
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,980
No one should know about me.

399
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,440
I'll disappear from here, brother.

400
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,870
Please spare me!
- If they find out...

401
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,220
I won't speak a word.

402
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:52,560
He'll kill me.
Slay me right here.

403
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:26,290
I'm sorry sir. I can't let my
students sign your petition.

404
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,390
You may leave.

405
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:32,980
The 'Justice for Sameera'
campaign has my support.

406
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:35,880
This is Samarth Bhagwat,
the DC of Bangalore.

407
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,670
Please lend your support too.

408
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,440
Save Government colleges.

409
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,200
WE WANT JUSTICE [IN UNISON]

410
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:57,520
[PROTEST CRIES CONTINUE]

411
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:06,320
We've planned a project to
equip Government colleges

412
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:09,560
...and Aided colleges with
optimum teaching facilities.

413
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:11,450
I stand with
Government colleges.

414
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:19,350
Sir, we now have five thousand
students' signatures for the petition.

415
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:33,380
Leave a lasting impression

416
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:37,490
Keep steering ahead

417
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,880
Be an unwavering voice

418
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,340
Be your own companion

419
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:53,850
What fate holds, is beyond us

420
00:29:54,390 --> 00:30:01,980
The destiny we aim for,
is always on us

421
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:08,720
Let us be the author
of our own lives

422
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:16,010
Who will dare stop us
from being ourselves?

423
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:20,620
WE WANT JUSTICE!

424
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,850
Namaskara (Salutations) DC Sir!

425
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,790
I'm Antony Joseph.

426
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:44,290
I'm the MD of RNC group.
- Tell me.

427
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:47,070
You're the son of the Wisdom Goddess and
I, of the Goddess of Wealth.

428
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,600
The two Goddesses
never go hand in hand.

429
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,920
Because women tend to
be highly egoistic.

430
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,760
They want men with Government jobs
but not the ones with Government salaries.

431
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:59,140
I think no woman will be happy with
a man who only has a salary to offer.

432
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,240
Excuse me?!

433
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,060
Money is of the least priority
for those who love their job.

434
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,030
I'm doing this job out
of the love for it!

435
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:09,950
My voice is for my
college and my teacher.

436
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:13,270
Justice for Sameera
campaign will continue.

437
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:17,080
Looks like Private colleges have
started getting the shivers.

438
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,550
Fearful of losing out
to the Wealth Goddess.

439
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,710
Where there's Wisdom,
there's no ego.

440
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,610
Wealth will follow.

441
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,020
And if a woman can't stand
a man who only has his

442
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,880
...hard earned salary money
to offer; I'd rather remain single.

443
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:32,090
Bachelors are highly regarded
in our country right now.

444
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,040
If you ever think of
messing with my college...

445
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:38,470
I won't spare you.
See you around.

446
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:46,070
According to the
Illustration, Human bones...

447
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:48,230
Why are you acting
like a Covid patient?

448
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,660
You'll be fine. Keep moving.

449
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:50,820
You'll meet Karishma over there.

450
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:52,580
He shouldn't find out
that I'm a lecturer.

451
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:55,460
Look at the board.

452
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:58,160
Madam, sit by my side everyday
and take all the classes.

453
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,530
That would be hot.

454
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,360
All of you make a note.
I'll be back in a moment.

455
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,430
He's fine now.
It's a case of food poisoning.

456
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:16,330
He had soft drinks last night.
Somebody must have drugged it.

457
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,110
The chemicals have
made him sick.

458
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,980
The number of drug addicts
in our college has gone up.

459
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,320
The supply of drugs is rampant.

460
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,030
Our college has changed a lot.

461
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,590
Medical students aren't
getting any cases for studies.

462
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,730
Weren't you lamenting
that our college

463
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,710
...hardly has cases
or patients to study?

464
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:50,830
His broken wrist and your specialisation
being Orthopaedics is a perfect match now.

465
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:52,120
Come on. Heal him.

466
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:59,960
There won't be any noise.
Study him. Get started.

467
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,500
Shall I break his left hand?
Will you practice? Come.

468
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:04,690
Brother, we're Cardiologists.

469
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:07,100
If you had any heart patients for
us, it would help us.

470
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:09,230
Do I look like someone
who supplies patients?

471
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:10,450
Go online and get one!

472
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:11,610
Help our department sir.

473
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:13,750
How about I get
admitted as a patient?

474
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:16,080
Brother, we need a case
for our Dental study.

475
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:18,900
You guys are asking as if I'm
selling tomatoes over here.

476
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,010
Brother?

477
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:21,760
Sir, please.

478
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:24,000
[IN MALAYALAM] Brother,
our department needs a patient.

479
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,440
[IN TELUGU] Brother,
we need a liver for study.

480
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:28,980
Thrash another goon for us.
Please?

481
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,820
Don't...

482
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:37,390
He's not our target.
We're here for the college.

483
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:41,730
Internals and Lab
exams are nearing.

484
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:44,180
None of the students
should be able to focus.

485
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,330
Nurse check his BP every two hours.
- Doctor, what happened to them?

486
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:59,260
Hello Doctor.
They're all patients of drug abuse.

487
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:04,240
With no drugs in their
system in the last few days,

488
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,780
...they've hurt themselves
overcome by anxiety and irritation.

489
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,740
The gravest case in
here is that of Ankith.

490
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:12,770
He fell off the building
and has fractured his knees.

491
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:13,940
He's also mentally unstable.

492
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:15,620
He's very disturbed.

493
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,580
It's the same case with everyone here.

494
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:20,080
They're all in need
of rehabilitation.

495
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,010
If they weren't brought here in
time, their lives would be in danger.

496
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,380
For further treatment,
Doctor Kokila Raman will be coming.

497
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:29,150
If you know anything
more, help them out.

498
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,300
I've done my job. The rest...
- Move! Sir...

499
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,540
Someone dressed like a
joker is approaching.

500
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,260
Did a patient of yours escape?

501
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:37,300
Looks like sir's here.

502
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:44,500
Is he a doctor?

503
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,650
Uncle!

504
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,400
Hello Doctor!

505
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:18,680
Did you get your
Ramayana book after all?

506
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,440
You tried so hard for it.

507
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,780
Why worry?
The case ended in our favour.

508
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:26,910
Read more.
Keep reading Ramayana, okay?

509
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:28,190
He's also a Mind reader.

510
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:31,160
You're a Good boy.

511
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,380
He seems stoned to the hilt,
how will he rehabilitate them?

512
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,580
He's been in a Rehab before.
He knows the mentality of its patients.

513
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:42,700
You don't worry.
Just support him.

514
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,650
Dear Daughter...?
- Daddy!

515
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,410
My baby!

516
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,750
There's no father like you...
[POPULAR KANNADA SONG]

517
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,300
Wait and watch sir.

518
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,700
I love you daddy!

519
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,280
Who are you?
- The doctor's assistant.

520
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,560
Get lost!

521
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:30,730
What's happening here?

522
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:37,630
Wait until I get out.
I wonâ€™t spare you!

523
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:40,860
Dude, I'll never let you out of here!
Get going!

524
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:45,450
I had no idea that this college and its
students are in such horrendous condition.

525
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:49,390
If word gets out,
our college's reputation will be tainted.

526
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,680
Make sure nobody knows about this.
- Sure sir.

527
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:56,600
Sir, he's our senior
Psychologist Dr. Kokila Raman.

528
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,440
I'm Jaypal, the Vice-Principal.
- Glad to meet you sir.

529
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,930
I'm Ranadheera Kanteerava.

530
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:03,520
Wait, do we have an empty bed?

531
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:06,080
Why?
- You should hear yourself.

532
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,010
Doctor, how are things?

533
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:09,370
Yes.

534
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:12,340
There are a lot of issues here.

535
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:16,150
I will leave only after
I resolve them all.

536
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:19,110
You see the radiance in my
eyes, don't you?

537
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:20,860
Only the cataract is visible.

538
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,250
Get it operated.

539
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,230
See you doctor.
- Let's go.

540
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:27,110
Radiance...? All I see is a booger.

541
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,960
There is an issue.
A big one at that!

542
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,930
You're right sir.
What do we do now?

543
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,480
Sir?

544
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:36,390
Inject this into him.

545
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:42,300
What was the management doing when
drugs were making its way into the college?

546
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,440
We're trying hard to keep
Government colleges afloat

547
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,420
...and you're
only making it worse.

548
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,620
That's not the case sir.
- I'll take serious action.

549
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:50,740
Every Government college
will receive a notice.

550
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,670
This shouldn't repeat.
Be careful.

551
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,100
Sorry sir.
- Good.

552
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:56,560
Namaskara
- Glad to see Gurudev Deshmukh.

553
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,810
How are you?
Hope everything's fine.

554
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:00,680
All thanks to your
support and inspiration.

555
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:04,530
80,000 students and 58 colleges
have signed the petition.

556
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,210
This college too will join us.

557
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,800
We will submit it to the
court at the earliest.

558
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:13,070
Your support for Government
colleges is much needed.

559
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:15,600
Definitely. All the best.
- Thank you.

560
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,910
I shall take your leave now.

561
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:19,680
Let's go in.

562
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:25,960
Basya?

563
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:27,930
His body's leaned to the left.

564
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:29,770
And THAT has leaned to the right.

565
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:32,570
Why is his sight
pointing to that side?

566
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:38,710
There lies the problem!

567
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:40,350
Mister Curls, speak up!

568
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,480
He's not even fluttering
his eyelashes.

569
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:44,490
He's under observation.
He needs time to recover.

570
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,990
Excuse me? I'll just be back.

571
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:50,020
All he did was look and then
came... those damned tears!

572
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,840
This is a case of failed love.
- I know.

573
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:55,070
A girl broke his heart.
- Brother...

574
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:58,270
Girls only know how to break hearts.
And all boys know is to mend hearts.

575
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,890
Don't get confused.
Tell me more.

576
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:02,330
Since his love failed,
he's become an addict.

577
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,340
There's a bigger
problem at stake.

578
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,430
Hallucinations.

579
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:07,270
He experiences visual
hallucinations.

580
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:10,150
Whenever he sees a
couple in front of him,

581
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:12,830
...he begins to hallucinate
thinking of his lover.

582
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:18,520
Just like how he saw you both
and is hallucinating now.

583
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:21,290
The two of you will have to
be happy in front of him.

584
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:24,980
One more failed love story and
it might be the end of his story.

585
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,450
Let's go Basya.

586
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:31,940
Arjun?

587
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,790
Arjun?!

588
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,750
What are you doing?!
- Woah!

589
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:38,730
Look at that Basya, he's elated.

590
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:43,580
He's seeing himself and
his girlfriend in us.

591
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,130
Visual hallucinations.

592
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:49,640
See... He's reacting.
And he's happy.

593
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:54,690
The effort is his,
and look who's taking the credits!

594
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,190
They're made for each other.

595
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:00,160
Where is their cart of love?
- Their Cart...?!

596
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:07,930
Why are you acting like this?!

597
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,460
Control yourself, Doctor!

598
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,520
DOCTOR!

599
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:20,710
Sorry. I myself had a moment
of visual hallucination.

600
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,240
Get the ropes!
Tie him up!

601
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,290
I need to propose tomorrow.
Let me go.

602
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:32,750
Tomorrow's Valentine's Day!
Love-day!

603
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,710
Anju, I love you.

604
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:39,360
Will you be my...
- Do you love each other?

605
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,470
What's with the Roses?
Tie the knots now!

606
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:43,200
Sir, please don't do this.
- Tie it! Now!

607
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,640
Please don't do this.
- A Taali or a Rakhi? You choose!

[INDISTINCT COMMOTION]

609
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,420
You want her, right?

610
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,820
Tie the Taali !

611
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,280
Do it now!

612
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:02,780
You both are a great pair.
Tie the knots! Now!

613
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:06,360
Give it to me.
I'll show you how it's done.

614
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:16,860
Stop right there!

615
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:20,450
Everyone! Get her!
Stop right there!

616
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,380
Stop!

617
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,190
Look who's there!

618
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:07,570
How can you get married
without a priest?

619
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:10,690
You think you can marry without the
chants and a glimpse of the stars?

620
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:12,200
What say, Mr. Priest?
- You're right.

621
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:15,430
They're the Groom's family
and we are the Bride's family.

622
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:18,000
If you get them married soon,
we'll get the reception started.

623
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:19,050
Let the wedding begin!

624
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:20,540
Sir, give it a minute.

625
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,400
The inauspicious time
will come to an end.

626
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,370
We can then get started.
- Done, Mr. Priest.

627
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,030
Didn't you ask for
a heart patient?

628
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,670
Will two of them do?

629
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:33,090
I'll tie the Taali right away!

630
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:34,770
Listen to me.
The time's not right...

631
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:36,480
The Lord of Death
will hover on you.

632
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:38,280
Let go of my hand, you prick!

633
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:04,110
Mr. Priest,
looks like we're skipping the wedding

634
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:06,000
...and directly heading
for the last supper!

635
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:08,940
I'm all set to serve them!
- As you wish.

Thank you!

637
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:26,370
This one's for the dental branch.

Thank you sir.

639
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:50,250
His knee cap is in pieces!
Hurry up!

640
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:15,490
Mr. Priest, I don't hear
you chanting the mantras!

641
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,020
There's no way my mantra
will suit this occasion.

642
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:20,360
Time to read out the afterlife scriptures.
- Arjun!

643
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:08,890

We are far apart, yet here we are,
living in the moment

Thereâ€™s nowhere else Iâ€™d rather
be on this globe, but within you

662

As the beats fill my racing heart,
I run out of breath

663
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:12,620
For all the loneliness
Iâ€™ve suffered, here you are

The sweetest and the
perfect cure there is

For all the affection that brims out of me,
the care you provide is the answer

666
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:31,140
Warding off all the evil glances from me,
your eyes continue to guard me.

00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:17,010
It's sad that you messed
with someone's life.

686
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:29,600
Care for a cigarette?

687
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:32,160
All the fire I need is in here.
Don't need any more. Go on.

688
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:33,980
You are the right match for me.

689
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,740
Ever since I set my foot in the field,
there's no competition for me.

690
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:38,210
Only two kinds of people remain.

691
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:41,050
The kind I like.
The kind that likes me.

692
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:45,840
How long will you keep him there?
Put him down!

693
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,130
Nobody's ever touched my men.

694
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:53,630
And if they did,
they've never lived to tell the story.

695
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:57,130
Why did you hit him?
- Didn't you tell him why?

696
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:01,690
Irrespective of what the matter is,
there was no need to get physical.

697
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:04,450
I'm done smacking him and
got him treated too. Move on!

698
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,810
Do you wish to fight in the
college and become a don?

699
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,810
I'm from Mangaluru.
Shetty's aide.

700
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:11,140
They got me admitted in
the college. So I'm here.

701
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,370
Guys! He's one of us!

702
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:19,780
I was the one who asked
Shetty to send me his aide.

703
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,940
And he's sent me the
perfect man for it.

704
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:24,590
One of our men is already
in the college management.

705
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:27,970
If you build a coffin,
he'll cover it with a tombstone.

706
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:31,090
Once the dean's back in college,
you know what to do, right?

707
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:32,150
Yes.

708
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:34,330
He's one of ours.
Don't get into a brawl.

709
00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:36,120
Leave him alone.

710
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:37,160
Hello?!

711
00:50:37,590 --> 00:50:40,500
Shouldn't you be telling me that?
I'll leave them alone.

712
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:42,640
Don't worry. No more fistfights.

713
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:46,280
He's taken some whooping for you.
Take good care of him.

714
00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:57,090
He's a Smiling Assassin.
I like him.

715

[VIOLENT PAINFUL SCREAMS]

716
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,830
Quit resisting!
- Inject the medicine!

717
00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:14,640
PATIENT: Let me go!

718
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,970
Give her this.
- Doctor, what's happening?

719
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:18,690
Somebody has drugged them all.

720
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:21,300
Drugs? How did it make
it into the Rehab?

721
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:22,720
How do I know all that?

722
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:25,760
Doctor, we only have one option.
To stabilise them all.

723
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:28,020
Why take drugs and
scream your head off?

724
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,600
Get back to bed!

725
00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:32,280
I'm not the one who's
enjoying the kick, you are!

726
00:51:32,310 --> 00:51:35,090
The real kick lies in wooing your
lecturer and making a move on her!

727
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,610
What better high do you want?
- Shut up!

728
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:40,530
I'm not the one who's under influence.
You are.

729
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:43,420
You're the one enjoying the
high of hitting on a lecturer.

730
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:47,890
The dove of love has flown away

732
00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:05,190
Arjun!
- Quit monkeying around!

733
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:07,150
Get back to your beds now.
- Arjun!

734
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:19,080
We'll get our stuff
in the evening.

735
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:25,610
Didn't I give you
guys the tablets?

736
00:52:25,630 --> 00:52:27,850
Why didn't you take it?!

737
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:29,850
Why should we take
the tablets you give?

738
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:33,110
Did I not tell you to take the tablets?
- We're not drug addicts.

739
00:52:35,170 --> 00:52:37,200
Where's the Vice-Principal's chamber?
- Upstairs.

740
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,720
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

741
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:41,540
Well... Sir...

742
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:43,650
How are you doing?

743
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:46,530
I was just checking if they
took the tablets you'd prescribed.

744
00:52:47,070 --> 00:52:48,530
All it took was
a bit of a force.

745
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,480
They're good boys.
They'll take the tablets.

746
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:52,220
Thank you sir.

747
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:53,680
Take care.

748
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,220
When did I prescribe
tablets for them?

749
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:38,970
Do you suspect anyone?

750
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:50,580
Students are being harassed
in the name of ragging.

751
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,190
Drugs are being consumed.

752
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:55,690
An anonymous complaint has been lodged
that all of this is troubling students.

753
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:57,220
Drugs? In our college?

754
00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:59,930
There's absolutely no chance of that.
It's a false allegation.

755
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:01,940
Seems like a case of
personal vendetta.

756
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:04,310
Our college has a legacy
of fifty long years!

757
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:07,410
I'm an alumnus of this college.
- Oh, that's nice.

758
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:11,610
I won't let anyone taint the reputation
of this college and its students.

759
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:16,300
There's no one in the library.
Get here soon.

760
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:24,420
How will we meet if
there's another lockdown?

761
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:27,240
Is this the place to romance?
Get out!

762
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:29,350
What's your admission number?
What about yours lady?

763
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:30,620
We're sorry, sir.
- Get out!

764
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,010
Good afternoon ma'am

765
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:51,890
Make sure students get
any book they ask for.

766
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:52,970
Okay.

767
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:12,490
I want to know who
lodged the complaint!

768
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:15,090
Tell me!

769
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:19,410
I'll butcher each and every one
of you if you don't speak up now!

770
00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:20,850
Who was it?
Tell me!

771
00:55:35,350 --> 00:55:36,420
Who are you?

772
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:38,280
What is your motive to
be here in this college?

773
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:40,840
You hid from the cop
who came to enquire.

774
00:55:41,290 --> 00:55:44,070
And you were hiding drugs
in the books at the Library.

775
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:47,850
The day I was harassed, you thrashed
every one of those gang members

776
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:51,690
And when the same gang is beating
up students, why are you not reacting?!

777
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,450
I'm here on a mission.

778
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,370
The mission is all I'm focusing on.

779
00:55:58,050 --> 00:56:01,240
Arjun, boss is asking for us.
A meeting has been fixed.

780
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:02,320
We need to get there soon.

781
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,140
What are you staring at?
Come along!

782
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:27,240
What the hell is he doing here?!

783
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:30,250
He's one of our men. Don't panic!

784
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:34,260
Boss has planted
him in the college.

785
00:57:05,670 --> 00:57:07,380
Hello everyone.
Please be seated.

786
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:18,990
RK University's Principal Gurudev
Deshmukh is returning tomorrow

787
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:21,220
...with a petition
signed by sixty colleges.

788
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:22,640
So only this meeting.

789
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:25,690
Sir, if this is
submitted in the court.

790
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:27,200
Everything we've
done will be exposed.

791
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:29,180
All our scams will be
out for the world to see.

792
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:31,340
If they find out that we've
ruined R K University,

793
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,020
...and that we're
involved in KCET scam.

794
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:34,430
We're done for.

795
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:35,520
Have some water.

796
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:37,730
If your BP shoots up,
you'll be gone in no time.

797
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:46,290
It's Dean Gurudev Deshmukh!

798
00:57:50,090 --> 00:57:51,310
Hello?
- Sir...

799
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:56,060
Thanks to your political and moral
support, I've achieved it.

800
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,180
Many colleges are supporting us.

801
00:57:59,330 --> 00:58:02,640
I will return tomorrow and
submit the petition in the court.

802
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:05,960
Excellent. I will come
along with you to the court.

803
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:09,950
Let's submit it together.
Justice will be done to you.

804
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,420
Thank you very much.
- I'll wait in the court for you.

805
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:13,450
Okay sir.

806
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:14,540
Sir..?!

807
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,580
I told him that I'll be
waiting at the court...

808
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,290
Did I mention anything about
him reaching the court?!

809
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:23,700
Politicians like me...

810
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:27,020
...are two-faced,
make two different promises,

811
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:30,030
...maintain two businesses
and handle two affairs.

812
00:58:31,650 --> 00:58:34,410
One is to impress the public.

813
00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:38,570
The other is to deceive
and screw them.

814
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:46,080
He's been staring
at me all along.

815
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:48,700
Who is he?
- He's Shetty's aide.

816
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:49,960
A sharp shooter.

817
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:56,520
Gurudev Deshmukh shouldn't
make it to the court tomorrow.

818
00:59:22,330 --> 00:59:24,920
Having successfully completed the
'Justice for Sameera' campaign,

819
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:26,730
Dean of R K University,
Gurudev Deshmukh

820
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:28,830
...is heading to the court
to file his petition.

821
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:41,390
Did you get hold of him?

822
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:45,370
I'll be done in two minutes.
See you soon.

823
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:49,400
Yes. I'm here to
support this campaign.

824
01:00:49,630 --> 01:00:52,220
The welfare of a Government college
student is important to me.

825
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:54,950
I'll support them.
Thank you.

826
01:01:28,990 --> 01:01:30,780
Only ten minutes left
for the court hearing.

827
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:01,090
Namaste...
- Namaskara sir.

828
01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:04,790
This court lies under
my jurisdiction sir.

829
01:02:04,810 --> 01:02:07,440
I've been posted to handle the
security of the Education minister.

830
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:08,920
Hats off to your commitment.

831
01:02:09,410 --> 01:02:11,710
Proud to be your student.
- Thank you.

832
01:02:11,730 --> 01:02:12,800
Hello sir.

833
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,450
Thank you.
- You've done it!

834
01:02:35,650 --> 01:02:37,430
Sir, it's time for
the court hearing.

835
01:02:37,450 --> 01:02:39,590
Please go inside.
I'll be there in two minutes.

836
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:51,670
What happened?

837
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:56,550
Sir...

838
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:08,890
The court has decided
to handover the enquiry

839
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:12,660
...and investigation of
this case to the CBI.

840
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,200
Thank you sir.

841
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:27,250
Thank you Samarth.
- It's my duty sir.

842
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:35,290
Where is Arjun,
your college student?

843
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:37,610
[IN HINDI] Speak up!
Where is he now?

844
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:40,600
Speak out!
Or you'll be dead in seconds.

845
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:40,100
Internals, Classes and
Laboratories are on.

846
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:41,810
Students are studying
in the Library.

847
01:05:41,830 --> 01:05:43,100
They've fought like barbarians.

848
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:44,530
Who all were involved
in this brawl?

849
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:46,740
A gang that came
from outside and...

850
01:05:46,770 --> 01:05:48,550
One of our Engineering students.

851
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:50,820
Who is that idiot?!

852
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,590
He ran away twelve years ago.

853
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:15,820
Why has he returned?

854
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:21,120
His name's not Arjun.

855
01:06:22,810 --> 01:06:24,540
He is not Arjun!

856
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:30,840
It's the final Rugby match
between GRV and R K University.

857
01:06:34,050 --> 01:06:35,300
Here comes the captain.

858
01:06:35,570 --> 01:06:37,190
The Macho...!

859
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:11,650
Go for it Yuva!
- Come on Yuvaraj!

860
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:20,570
Come on Yuvaraj!

861
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:24,920
Sisterf*!@#r got away!

862
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:43,900
A cop's beating will
make the headlines.

863
01:07:43,930 --> 01:07:45,830
If boss retaliates,
you've neared your deadline.

864
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:47,240
DOWN WITH THE POLICE [IN UNISON]

865
01:07:47,270 --> 01:07:49,450
Are those men supposed
to be his supporters?

866
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:51,720
They're his fans sir.
Am I not right?

867
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:55,100
To you, a fan might be another person;
but to me, they're my power.

868
01:07:55,410 --> 01:07:56,880
They're my providers forever.

869
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:58,770
The most important
ones after my parents.

870
01:07:59,150 --> 01:08:01,100
Don't talk about them hastily.

871
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:03,620
Do you even know how to behave
with a double-starred officer?

872
01:08:03,650 --> 01:08:06,820
Sir, his star will last
until he's on duty.

873
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:09,600
The stardom they've bestowed
lasts until our last breath.

874
01:08:09,770 --> 01:08:11,510
Damn it! Let him go.

875
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:17,180
These achievers are on the college's
wall of fame to inspire us.

876
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:19,680
So that you live an inspiring
life and motivate others.

877
01:08:19,710 --> 01:08:23,230
I wish to see you on a
wall of fame like this.

878
01:08:23,260 --> 01:08:25,260
Not on the notice board
of a Police station.

879
01:08:29,210 --> 01:08:32,380
Yuvaraj, if you sit with Samarth,
you'll feel motivated. Come forward.

880
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:00,510
There you go.
- What's the occasion?

881
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:02,080
My friend is the
Student of the year.

882
01:09:02,110 --> 01:09:04,240
There you go. Have some.

883
01:09:04,270 --> 01:09:06,820
Why are you distributing sweets
as if you've won the award?

884
01:09:06,850 --> 01:09:09,660
You're not a true friend if you don't
celebrate your friend's success.

885
01:09:09,690 --> 01:09:12,590
Don't envy your neighbour's success.
Don't berate your own failure.

886
01:09:12,610 --> 01:09:15,240
Clearly, you shouldn't be here.
Take some sweets and move!

887
01:09:15,450 --> 01:09:17,060
Did you take some? Great!

888
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:18,840
Hello Madam!

889
01:09:19,110 --> 01:09:20,720
He didn't pass because
you taught him,

890
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:22,950
...but 'cause he studied on his own.
Have some sweets.

891
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:29,870
A week to go for the exams.

892
01:09:30,220 --> 01:09:33,410
Life outside college is a huge challenge.

893
01:09:33,790 --> 01:09:35,750
You won't have your
teachers to forgive you.

894
01:09:35,830 --> 01:09:36,990
It'll be your bosses.

895
01:09:37,390 --> 01:09:40,350
The education you have
now is your foundation.

896
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:44,750
Money, Power, Status and
Reputation follows your education.

897
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:48,480
To make your life steady,
you have to study.

898
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:52,390
I only have one tip for you.
Control your anger.

899
01:09:58,270 --> 01:09:59,350
Sir!

900
01:10:00,010 --> 01:10:04,380
Sir... Yuvaraj is beating up
the Computer Science Lecturer.

901
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:18,540
You Loafer!

902
01:10:20,890 --> 01:10:23,350
Sir, here's what he did...
- Shut up!

903
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,440
Whatever it is,
he's your lecturer.

904
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:28,820
How dare you hit your lecturer?

905
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:32,160
The one who raises his hand on his
Guru will never reach his goals!

906
01:10:32,190 --> 01:10:35,410
Do you think you'll prosper?
Is this what is taught here?!

907
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:37,510
Students...

908
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:41,450
Become what you want in life.
But never end up like him!

909
01:10:41,590 --> 01:10:44,390
This is as cheap as one can get!
Shut up!

910
01:10:44,410 --> 01:10:46,490
Please hear me out!
- I don't want to see your face.

911
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:49,070
Get out this college!
I said get out.

912
01:10:49,090 --> 01:10:51,090
Please listen to me once.
- Get out this college!

913
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:57,230
I'm sorry sir.

914
01:11:23,950 --> 01:11:25,980
What wrong intentions
have you come with now?

915
01:11:26,010 --> 01:11:28,550
Surely there are wrong intentions at play.
But they're not mine.

916
01:11:28,670 --> 01:11:30,110
The ones you're trusting are wrong.

917
01:11:30,550 --> 01:11:33,880
I came back as a student,
to spy one some people.

918
01:11:36,670 --> 01:11:40,730
Our college was targeted
by the MD of RNC group.

919
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:42,110
Antony Joseph.

920
01:11:42,870 --> 01:11:45,560
Several private colleges
have ganged up with him.

921
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:49,900
Our college is one of the
reputed Government colleges.

922
01:11:49,940 --> 01:11:52,070
They realised that if
we continue to prosper,

923
01:11:52,090 --> 01:11:54,220
...the demand for Government
colleges will go up.

924
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:56,570
So they've targeted the
results of Government colleges.

925
01:11:56,850 --> 01:11:59,950
The outcome of which was
the failure of KCET exam results.

926
01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:01,450
And the death of Sameera.

927
01:12:04,190 --> 01:12:05,510
You started protesting.

928
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:08,020
But they ensured colleges
backed out from the protest.

929
01:12:08,430 --> 01:12:10,650
They even put up an
act of supporting you.

930
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:14,730
When you were out campaigning,
they aimed to bring down our college.

931
01:12:16,210 --> 01:12:19,610
They got junkies and criminals
admitted into the college.

932
01:12:20,150 --> 01:12:23,100
They began to spoil the
lives of our students.

933
01:12:25,490 --> 01:12:28,630
When I came to the college,
the situation had gone out of hand.

934
01:12:28,650 --> 01:12:32,640
They assigned a Sharp shooter-Drug
peddler from Mangaluru to join our college.

935
01:12:32,670 --> 01:12:34,680
I learnt about his
plans for the college.

936
01:12:34,910 --> 01:12:38,440
He had come down to finish you and
spoil the students of this college.

937
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:44,100
I restrained him, took up his
identity and met Antony Joseph.

938
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,780
I joined his team and they
believed me to be one of them.

939
01:12:48,270 --> 01:12:51,690
They revealed that one of his men
was working for him in our college.

940
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:53,420
I began looking for him.

941
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:56,440
I registered a complaint with
the police as an anonymous student

942
01:12:56,470 --> 01:12:58,600
...claiming drugs were being
peddled in the college.

943
01:12:58,940 --> 01:13:01,230
To investigate the
same, Azad came down.

944
01:13:01,590 --> 01:13:04,020
I hid from him knowing
that if he identified me,

945
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:06,590
...my operation
would be in danger.

946
01:13:08,490 --> 01:13:12,080
When he was here, I saw fear in
the eyes of the Vice-Principal.

947
01:13:12,450 --> 01:13:14,370
But there seemed no
concern for the college.

948
01:13:14,950 --> 01:13:17,580
When I visited the rehab to check
on the students at night,

949
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:21,460
...drugs were being injected into
the students who were recovering.

950
01:13:21,710 --> 01:13:23,460
It was Vice-Principal, Jaipal.

951
01:13:24,410 --> 01:13:27,960
The gang members were beating up the
students because of the complaint.

952
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:30,590
I didn't react then.

953
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:34,740
Because I was waiting to meet
the mastermind behind it.

954
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:36,810
There's a man above Antony Joseph.

955
01:13:36,970 --> 01:13:39,410
Raghav Reddy, the Education Minister.

956
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:47,560
He's responsible for both Sameera's
death and this college's suffering.

957
01:13:48,730 --> 01:13:50,850
When you headed to the
court to file the petition,

958
01:13:50,870 --> 01:13:52,820
...they planned to
assassinate you on the way.

959
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:55,630
I left with them and
finished them all.

960
01:13:58,550 --> 01:14:00,350
You're behind the growth
of this college...

961
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:04,420
And with you, lies the growth
of thousands of students.

962
01:14:05,050 --> 01:14:06,550
Safeguard our college sir.

963
01:14:18,940 --> 01:14:20,220
Close the gates.

964
01:14:28,270 --> 01:14:29,290
Sir?

965
01:14:31,330 --> 01:14:32,640
Govind...

966
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:36,050
Let's discuss the
college matters tomorrow.

967
01:14:36,790 --> 01:14:39,530
I need sometime.
I'm not in a good mood.

968
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:41,840
I'm here to discuss
relationships.

969
01:14:43,450 --> 01:14:46,130
You and Yuvaraj, share the
relationship of a Guru and a disciple.

970
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:49,460
His relationship with the college
is that of a mother and son.

971
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:52,150
What transpired in the college
was something else.

972
01:14:52,180 --> 01:14:56,360
Sir, please!
Let me go.

973
01:14:56,390 --> 01:14:58,800
Let her go! Open the door!
- Sir!

974
01:15:15,980 --> 01:15:17,700
In a bid to prove
myself as a good man.

975
01:15:18,010 --> 01:15:21,460
Please don't ruin the life of the girl
and taint the college's reputation.

976
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,960
If people learn that a lecturer
like him exists in our college...

977
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:27,240
The public will look
down on our college.

978
01:15:38,610 --> 01:15:42,270
Be it the disciple or the Guru, when one
betrays the other, it is wrong, right?

979
01:15:45,310 --> 01:15:47,530
You misjudged him
since that incident.

980
01:15:47,810 --> 01:15:50,560
You kept him away for
failing in his exams.

981
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:52,300
You were biased to him.

982
01:15:52,570 --> 01:15:54,520
Yet he never let it bother him.

983
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:57,890
He came back for you
and this college.

984
01:15:59,540 --> 01:16:02,540
He's not a Rogue,
or a Hooligan like you assumed him to be.

985
01:16:03,510 --> 01:16:05,700
He's the ringmaster of all the
rogues and hooligans...

986
01:16:06,350 --> 01:16:09,230
A man who is highly sought out
by colleges across Karnataka...

987
01:16:09,970 --> 01:16:12,830
He's the Youth Icon of Karnataka
- A Professor.

988
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:27,920
I read about him in the papers.

989
01:16:28,340 --> 01:16:31,880
I learn that when the 'Justice
for Sameera' petition in Mangaluru was

990
01:16:31,910 --> 01:16:35,180
...opposed by St.
Joseph college and the local rowdies,

991
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:38,430
...he was the Student Union
Leader who stood by the students.

992
01:16:39,650 --> 01:16:43,780
When he was told of the situation in
our college, he abandoned his career.

993
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:50,580
Yuvaraj is the lead of
the Anti-Drugs Squad.

994
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:54,750
He had worked against drug trafficking
in all the colleges he served for.

995
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:57,960
He had conducted a sting operation
in Goa before coming to our college.

996
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:01,570
Wherever drugs were being
peddled in the college,

997
01:17:01,590 --> 01:17:03,990
...he replaced them
with anti-drug pills.

998
01:17:04,290 --> 01:17:07,620
He sent the students into rehabilitation
and helped them overcome their addiction.

999
01:17:32,290 --> 01:17:33,480
I'm sorry.

1000
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:36,770
There's always a reason
behind one's anger.

1001
01:17:36,790 --> 01:17:38,220
But I didn't bother
looking for it.

1002
01:17:39,150 --> 01:17:43,200
When you were a student, you protected the
college by picking a row with the bad guys.

1003
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:47,490
And you came back as a student,
to protect the reputation of the college.

1004
01:17:48,570 --> 01:17:52,710
Hereafter, you'll have to protect
this college - officially.

1005
01:17:54,140 --> 01:17:55,880
Report to the college
from tomorrow.

1006
01:17:56,050 --> 01:17:58,010
I now know who you are.

1007
01:17:59,140 --> 01:18:01,110
There are others who
need to learn about you.

1008
01:18:01,780 --> 01:18:02,820
See you.

1009
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:17,170
He's not a sharp shooter or a college
student like you assumed him to be.

1010
01:18:17,970 --> 01:18:21,110
Neither is he Shetty's
aide like we asked for.

1011
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:27,000
He became one of us and
in the end he f@#$@# us up!

1012
01:18:29,570 --> 01:18:30,790
Who is he?

1013
01:18:31,690 --> 01:18:34,310
Who the hell is he?!
- A Professor!

1014
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:40,740
He's a professor.

1015
01:18:41,150 --> 01:18:42,400
But you guys...

1016
01:18:42,900 --> 01:18:44,230
A tenth standard
failed student...

1017
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:46,480
You discontinued your II PUC...

1018
01:18:46,780 --> 01:18:49,780
And you bought your college
degree using your influence.

1019
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:53,200
When men like you can deceive...

1020
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:55,670
You don't think him,
a man from a middle class family...

1021
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:57,340
Someone who took his
studies seriously...

1022
01:18:57,370 --> 01:18:59,660
Someone who turned his
education into his accomplishment

1023
01:18:59,690 --> 01:19:01,210
...and his marks
into his identity.

1024
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:04,240
And despite failing, he faced the
society, kicked the insults

1025
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:06,500
...thrown at him and
stood tall among you all.

1026
01:19:06,890 --> 01:19:08,950
You don't think he can deceive you?

1027
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:12,110
The public doesn't know that
you're a tenth grade fail.

1028
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:16,610
Neither do they know that you're
failing merit students and killing them.

1029
01:19:16,990 --> 01:19:20,390
And he'll make sure they...
- Relax Master!

1030
01:19:20,490 --> 01:19:22,630
Do you think you're
running the Indian Army?

1031
01:19:22,660 --> 01:19:23,950
It's a college after all.

1032
01:19:23,980 --> 01:19:26,100
Clearly you have no idea
about the power of students.

1033
01:19:27,090 --> 01:19:28,640
And the power with me...

1034
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:30,180
...is my student.

1035
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:46,640
Don't you dare provoke a
Tiger, Annayya (Elder brother)!

1036
01:19:46,670 --> 01:19:48,000
It'll hunt you down!

1037
01:19:48,030 --> 01:19:49,150
Younger brother!

1038
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:52,470
I'm not going to call
myself a Lion or a Tiger.

1039
01:19:53,110 --> 01:19:54,620
I'm a lot more powerful.

1040
01:19:55,780 --> 01:19:58,130
I'm a human.
An educated human.

1041
01:19:58,590 --> 01:19:59,660
Do as you please.

1042
01:20:00,180 --> 01:20:01,360
I'll see you bro!

1043
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:04,510
You never learnt in your
school or college days.

1044
01:20:04,940 --> 01:20:06,160
He'll teach you.

1045
01:20:06,770 --> 01:20:08,020
The Devil is back!

1046
01:20:23,570 --> 01:20:26,660
The Principal has appointed him to
set things straight in this college.

1047
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:29,410
He's furious against wrongdoings,
yet is a man of honour.

1048
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:31,640
In the near future,
he'll surely take everyone to task.

1049
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:33,060
Hello!
- Hello sir.

1050
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:34,920
Namaskara and I wish
you all a Good Morning!

1051
01:20:34,940 --> 01:20:38,080
He's an alumni of this college and
is the newly appointed professor.

1052
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:41,130
Some people don't need an introduction,
only information will suffice.

1053
01:20:49,820 --> 01:20:50,910
Hi...

1054
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:02,260
Arjun, I didn't see you around
in college after the brawl.

1055
01:21:02,290 --> 01:21:04,700
I thought the Principal
rusticated you.

1056
01:21:05,180 --> 01:21:08,680
I left this college as a student.
But I'm back.

1057
01:21:09,470 --> 01:21:11,090
As a professor in this college.

1058
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:14,000
By the way, I'm not Arjun.

1059
01:21:14,610 --> 01:21:17,310
I'm Raj... Yuvaraj!

1060
01:21:18,550 --> 01:21:22,190
Neither could I tell you some things,
nor could I ask you about any.

1061
01:21:22,670 --> 01:21:26,510
I joined here as a
student on an operation.

1062
01:21:26,940 --> 01:21:28,360
The Operation was successful.

1063
01:21:29,070 --> 01:21:31,990
All these days,
you were a lecturer and I was a student.

1064
01:21:32,010 --> 01:21:35,090
There was a huge
generation gap between us.

1065
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:37,240
And now,
nothing can come between us.

1066
01:21:37,770 --> 01:21:40,590
Whenever we bump into each
other, spot each other. We can...

1067
01:21:41,390 --> 01:21:44,100
We can talk and
spend time together.

1068
01:21:44,950 --> 01:21:46,890
It'll take you a while
to get out of this shock.

1069
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:48,380
So please take your time.

1070
01:21:48,870 --> 01:21:52,830
Doctor...
Always your patient, Yuvaraj.

1071
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:01,950
Are you really a lecturer?
You look like a student.

1072
01:22:02,260 --> 01:22:03,380
What do I do madam?

1073
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,680
My brother and I.. We never age.

1074
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:11,790
Here's a list of this..
- Hi sir.

1075
01:22:11,820 --> 01:22:13,590
Welcome Professor.
- Thank you sir.

1076
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:16,610
Before I begin with lectures,
I have a special lecture for some.

1077
01:22:16,810 --> 01:22:18,540
As you wish.
- Thank you sir.

1078
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:22,550
Without enquiring their whereabouts, you've
admitted many wrong people, including me.

1079
01:22:22,580 --> 01:22:24,770
I want to know about all
those who were allowed in.

1080
01:22:24,790 --> 01:22:25,920
Care to join me?

1081
01:22:26,990 --> 01:22:29,430
Go ahead.
- Sir...

1082
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:31,190
I've to bear the brunt.
- Come on.

1083
01:22:31,210 --> 01:22:32,750
It's time for a surgical strike.

1084
01:22:36,970 --> 01:22:38,390
Excuse me madam?
- Yes?

1085
01:22:38,980 --> 01:22:40,340
The three of you.

1086
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:42,090
Get up and come
out of your seats!

1087
01:22:42,470 --> 01:22:44,330
Why are you guys standing?
Be seated!

1088
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:47,530
You might be a Professor to this college.
Not to us.

1089
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:49,250
You've been one of us, right?

1090
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:50,610
You know about us, don't you?

1091
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:52,490
You.. Come right now!

1092
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:53,850
And if I don't?

1093
01:22:53,870 --> 01:22:56,270
Do you have the guts?
You're going to hit me, huh?

1094
01:22:56,290 --> 01:22:57,780
My guts..?!
- Come to...

1095
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:01,340
Pick him up and follow me.

1096
01:23:13,630 --> 01:23:14,790
Come over!

1097
01:23:18,330 --> 01:23:19,420
Don't you dare!

1098
01:23:21,850 --> 01:23:23,260
Don't mess with me.

1099
01:23:32,370 --> 01:23:34,740
My father's a Corporator.
I'll make you disappear.

1100
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:37,070
A Corporator?
Which ward is he from?

1101
01:23:37,250 --> 01:23:40,030
I'll take you right inside
your ward and smack you!

1102
01:23:40,530 --> 01:23:44,270
You think you can throw a fit just because
your dad's a Corporator or an MLA?!

1103
01:23:44,690 --> 01:23:49,090
If you and father can get this cocky
for winning by bribing the public...

1104
01:23:49,660 --> 01:23:52,230
The very public have paid
and bestowed victory upon us.

1105
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:53,890
Imagine how cocky we can get!

1106
01:24:03,870 --> 01:24:06,220
What shampoo do
you apply to your hair?

1107
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:08,250
Shikakai, huh?!
Goddamn, look at them!

1108
01:24:12,010 --> 01:24:13,770
You... Come here!

1109
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:15,150
Get in the van.

1110
01:24:15,170 --> 01:24:17,150
I'll get you all
quarantined in the prison!

1111
01:24:18,810 --> 01:24:19,860
Right! Get moving!

1112
01:24:23,590 --> 01:24:25,740
Must be a senior officer!
- Is that Annamalai?!

1113
01:24:25,770 --> 01:24:27,450
Annamalai left the
department long ago.

1114
01:24:28,470 --> 01:24:30,780
All of them are phony students!

1115
01:24:30,810 --> 01:24:33,430
I've got them along
with the evidence.

1116
01:24:33,450 --> 01:24:36,390
Book cases on them as per
IPC sections 463 and 464.

1117
01:24:36,410 --> 01:24:38,130
Okay sir.
- Sir, we're innocent. Let us go!

1118
01:24:38,150 --> 01:24:39,850
We've not committed
anything wrong!

1119
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:42,400
Give one to sir. Go on!
- Okay sir.

1120
01:24:42,730 --> 01:24:45,070
Dolly Alias Devanand.
- And you.. What's your name?

1121
01:24:45,090 --> 01:24:46,250
Tannery Road Thyagi.

1122
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:47,400
Sir, your cup of tea.

1123
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:49,950
[ROWDY] This isn't just a collar,
but a high voltage wire!

1124
01:24:49,970 --> 01:24:52,410
These idiots have been
spoiled by cinema!

1125
01:24:53,140 --> 01:24:54,470
Why blame Cinema?

1126
01:24:54,710 --> 01:24:56,930
Films have asked people to
walk away from Rowdyism.

1127
01:24:57,060 --> 01:25:00,690
Films have shown cops arresting family
when it comes to doing the right thing.

1128
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:04,150
Films have even asked children not to
abandon their parents into old age homes.

1129
01:25:04,350 --> 01:25:05,710
Why don't you follow any of this?

1130
01:25:06,260 --> 01:25:08,510
The good and bad doesn't
depend on what is shown.

1131
01:25:08,540 --> 01:25:09,880
It depends on what we perceive.

1132
01:25:10,060 --> 01:25:12,340
Remember that!
Want some tea?

1133
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:16,220
Senior officer's here.
He's waiting. Please come!

1134
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:21,200
Dude!

1135
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:28,850
Do you know the officer well?

1136
01:25:29,220 --> 01:25:30,550
Officer?!

1137
01:25:30,650 --> 01:25:32,320
What case have you
gotten yourself into?

1138
01:25:32,570 --> 01:25:34,640
Sir, he's a Police officer.

1139
01:25:34,750 --> 01:25:36,830
I'm not a cop like you think.

1140
01:25:37,780 --> 01:25:38,940
I'm a Professor!

1141
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:40,280
Professor?!

1142
01:25:40,460 --> 01:25:42,250
This goon's a Professor now?!

1143
01:25:42,340 --> 01:25:45,220
Sir, did you appoint
him as a Professor?

1144
01:25:45,650 --> 01:25:47,220
How did you do that?

1145
01:25:47,670 --> 01:25:50,110
My Dear Professor!
- Hello Mr. Collector!

1146
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:54,310
A teacher needs to know
all of the 64 arts.

1147
01:25:54,660 --> 01:25:56,610
He knows them all.
He knows to sing and dance.

1148
01:25:56,660 --> 01:25:58,700
Also makes people sing
and dance to his tunes.

1149
01:25:58,730 --> 01:26:00,990
He's brave and infuses
bravery in everyone.

1150
01:26:01,010 --> 01:26:02,450
So happy for you Yuvaraj.

1151
01:26:02,470 --> 01:26:04,910
The one who was scolding you
is singing praises about you.

1152
01:26:04,930 --> 01:26:06,490
That is called success.

1153
01:26:06,510 --> 01:26:07,960
Thank you!
- Sir, how about a selfie?

1154
01:26:07,990 --> 01:26:09,540
Sure, why not?

1155
01:26:10,890 --> 01:26:13,460
R K University is not a
safe space for students.

1156
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:15,800
If drugs are doing rounds
in a Government college,

1157
01:26:15,820 --> 01:26:18,240
...Principal Gurudev
Deshmukh is to be blamed.

1158
01:26:23,550 --> 01:26:26,200
In the pretext of a protest,
he joined hands with

1159
01:26:26,230 --> 01:26:28,820
...Private colleges and ruined
the lives of his students.

1160
01:26:28,980 --> 01:26:30,900
Here are his digital
signatures on all the scams.

1161
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:37,880
Gurudev Deshmukh is
responsible for Sameera's death

1162
01:26:37,910 --> 01:26:39,570
...and for my exit
from the college.

1163
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:44,920
The condition of students in
R K University is tragic.

1164
01:26:44,940 --> 01:26:48,850
Save the poor students from the
criminal, Gurudev Deshmukh.

1165
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:49,930
Please!

1166
01:27:18,730 --> 01:27:20,570
We have a legal
notice from the Court.

1167
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:23,110
The college has been locked down.
Move from here!

1168
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:27,600
Sir, if you throw all these students
out, what will happen to their future?

1169
01:27:27,620 --> 01:27:30,020
We're just following our orders.
Get out of here. Quick!

1170
01:27:45,410 --> 01:27:48,460
What lies next in the lives
of these poor students?

1171
01:27:48,470 --> 01:27:51,020
[NEWS REPORT] Will R K University
see light of the day again?

1172
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:52,860
What does future hold
for these students?

1173
01:28:08,970 --> 01:28:10,820
Sir, we can leave now.

1174
01:28:20,900 --> 01:28:22,820
Sir, a notice has been
issued by this board.

1175
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:26,430
R K University, a Government
college has been closed alleging

1176
01:28:26,460 --> 01:28:28,920
Lack of Infrastructure,
Misuse of funds,

1177
01:28:28,950 --> 01:28:32,090
Passive silence on drugs and drug
addiction in the college premises.

1178
01:28:32,110 --> 01:28:33,830
...among other allegations.

1179
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:37,360
I'm not here to
defend my college.

1180
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:42,360
I'm here to seek justice on behalf of the
students who study in Government colleges.

1181
01:28:43,090 --> 01:28:46,500
Majority of our students
are of the middle class,

1182
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:49,850
lower-middle class and
labour class background.

1183
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:52,080
Education is already a
far-fetched dream for them.

1184
01:28:52,690 --> 01:28:54,190
It shouldn't become
an impossibility.

1185
01:28:54,620 --> 01:28:58,420
In the last one year, 56 Government
colleges have been shut down.

1186
01:28:59,450 --> 01:29:02,680
Corporations are denying
the Right to Education.

1187
01:29:03,390 --> 01:29:05,740
If colleges continue to shut
down, parents will be helpless

1188
01:29:05,770 --> 01:29:07,950
...regarding where to
educate their children.

1189
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:10,100
Education should be valued.

1190
01:29:10,270 --> 01:29:11,770
It shouldn't come
with a price tag.

1191
01:29:12,150 --> 01:29:15,650
Privatisation of Education attaches
a price to every letter learned.

1192
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:17,530
It will not value the student.

1193
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:20,620
The society should get rid
of the mindset of wanting

1194
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:22,900
...Government jobs but
dismissing Government Education.

1195
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:27,120
No student has ever failed because
of a damaged bench in the classroom.

1196
01:29:27,740 --> 01:29:30,700
Those who drafted the
Constitution, framed the syllabus,

1197
01:29:30,730 --> 01:29:35,880
...scientists, esteemed writers and poets
have all studied in Government colleges.

1198
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:38,180
Without Public education,
neither would you

1199
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:40,280
...be sitting there,
nor would I be standing here.

1200
01:29:41,350 --> 01:29:43,780
I'll fight the allegations
against me in the court.

1201
01:29:45,140 --> 01:29:48,350
Court procedures will take time and that
shouldn't cause trouble to the students.

1202
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:51,280
If proven guilty, I will...

1203
01:29:52,050 --> 01:29:54,020
I will stay away
from this college.

1204
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:59,100
Don't keep my students
away from the college.

1205
01:30:02,660 --> 01:30:03,810
Please...

1206
01:30:21,350 --> 01:30:23,300
Hello Professor Yuvaraj!

1207
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:25,450
Heard you've sought permission
to reopen the college.

1208
01:30:25,740 --> 01:30:28,570
The board might grant
it, but I will not.

1209
01:30:30,220 --> 01:30:33,830
Hereafter, your college students
will be mercilessly tortured.

1210
01:30:33,850 --> 01:30:35,400
There will be
countless abductions!

1211
01:30:35,460 --> 01:30:37,620
Lecturers will leave for
college, but won't make it.

1212
01:30:37,650 --> 01:30:39,850
Students will leave for their
homes, but won't make it.

1213
01:30:39,870 --> 01:30:43,190
You've provoked a criminal,
crime is bound to follow.

1214
01:30:43,220 --> 01:30:44,680
You now have two options.

1215
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:47,750
Either fall at my legs,
or tear my limbs apart.

1216
01:31:46,890 --> 01:31:48,780
Where did he go? Find him!

1217
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:54,910
Come to me!

1218
01:32:07,450 --> 01:32:10,700
All that mass you're strutting comes from
your protein and vitamin supplements.

1219
01:32:11,230 --> 01:32:13,000
I was born with
this mass appeal.

1220
01:33:45,730 --> 01:33:47,520
A country needs a soldier

1221
01:33:47,610 --> 01:33:49,470
A civilization needs a farmer

1222
01:33:49,530 --> 01:33:52,420
And life is incomplete
without a Guru

1223
01:33:53,410 --> 01:33:55,250
For he instils the letter in us

1224
01:33:55,270 --> 01:33:57,240
Eliminates the ignorance in us

1225
01:33:57,260 --> 01:34:00,420
He is indeed our provider

1226
01:34:01,180 --> 01:34:04,980
Righting our wrongs
Imparting wisdom to us

1227
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:08,450
This is the path of
our enlightenment

1228
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:12,640
No matter how far you go
Lest you forget your roots

1229
01:34:12,770 --> 01:34:15,900
The advent of your
success is here

1230
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:19,330
Paatashaala [The School]

1231
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:22,850
Paatashaala!

1232
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:26,980
Paatashaala!

1233
01:34:27,660 --> 01:34:30,200
Paatashaala!

1234
01:34:47,670 --> 01:34:51,390
A country needs a soldier
A civilization needs a farmer

1235
01:34:51,420 --> 01:34:54,500
And life is incomplete
without a Guru

1236
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:57,270
For he instils the letter in us

1237
01:34:57,290 --> 01:34:59,510
Eliminates the ignorance in us

1238
01:34:59,530 --> 01:35:02,400
He is indeed our provider

1239
01:35:27,740 --> 01:35:30,080
We don't abandon our fathers
for not earning well.

1240
01:35:30,110 --> 01:35:32,630
We don't abandon our
mothers if they're unwell.

1241
01:35:32,650 --> 01:35:34,880
We don't abandon our friends
for not being successful.

1242
01:35:34,900 --> 01:35:36,570
Our college had our
backs when we failed.

1243
01:35:36,590 --> 01:35:38,850
When our college fails,
it's our turn to stand with it.

1244
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:41,770
I'm Professor Yuvaraj.
I graduated from R K University.

1245
01:35:41,790 --> 01:35:45,630
It is here we learned
to express ourselves

1246
01:35:45,660 --> 01:35:49,370
It is here we wilfully
took our strides

1247
01:35:49,390 --> 01:35:53,510
It is here we walked
towards our dreams

1248
01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:57,310
It is here our friends
showered all the love on us

1249
01:35:57,330 --> 01:36:01,150
Everyoneâ€™s equal in here,
for prejudice has no place here

1250
01:36:01,180 --> 01:36:05,020
When the hunger to learn exists,
there is no beginning or end to it

1251
01:36:05,050 --> 01:36:09,030
Our homes are our first schools
Our mothers - our first teacher

1252
01:36:09,060 --> 01:36:12,760
Our mothers too learned from the one
- The Guru

1253
01:36:12,950 --> 01:36:16,770
Our land believes education
is the greatest of all charity

1254
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:20,290
Such is our country,
a visionary one

1255
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:24,360
We need to have a goal ahead of
us, and a Guru having our back

1256
01:36:24,390 --> 01:36:27,720
Trust and tread forward,
life will indeed be fulfilling

1257
01:36:27,750 --> 01:36:31,600
Paatashaala!

1258
01:36:31,620 --> 01:36:34,540
Paatashaala!

1259
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:37,950
Paatashaala!

1260
01:36:38,980 --> 01:36:40,120
Paatashaala!

1261
01:36:40,150 --> 01:36:41,480
I graduated with R K University.

1262
01:36:41,500 --> 01:36:44,210
Although it was my parents
who brought me to this world,

1263
01:36:44,230 --> 01:36:48,510
It was my college and my Gurus
who introduced me to this world.

1264
01:36:48,540 --> 01:36:50,510
I graduated from R K University.

1265
01:37:07,270 --> 01:37:10,730
It is here we learnt
to come together

1266
01:37:11,130 --> 01:37:14,780
It is here we shared our bites

1267
01:37:15,030 --> 01:37:18,850
It is here we learnt
to bow to the elders

1268
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:22,690
It is here we learned
the way of life

1269
01:37:22,710 --> 01:37:26,410
Education isnâ€™t punishment; but
a charm that will protect us

1270
01:37:26,430 --> 01:37:30,440
The hand that holds the book; holds
the blueprint to the right path

1271
01:37:30,460 --> 01:37:34,260
The hard earned money of
our parents helps us prosper

1272
01:37:34,290 --> 01:37:37,840
The patience of a Guru
helps us write our destiny.

1273
01:37:37,870 --> 01:37:41,710
It is our providers who
endure the hardships of money

1274
01:37:41,730 --> 01:37:45,620
While those hungry for
education, know no such thing

1275
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:49,400
Marks and Degrees
donâ€™t define success

1276
01:37:49,420 --> 01:37:52,890
The morals and values we possess,
will make us undefeatable

1277
01:37:53,020 --> 01:37:56,970
Paatashaala!

1278
01:37:56,990 --> 01:37:59,670
Paatashaala!

1279
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:03,860
Paatashaala!

1280
01:38:04,650 --> 01:38:07,560
Paatashaala!

1281
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:14,010
I'm Shathrugan Salimath.

1282
01:38:14,030 --> 01:38:18,610
I'm the investigation officer appointed
by NAAC and AICTE board of India.

1283
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:23,140
This is the Inspection
notice from the board.

1284
01:38:23,490 --> 01:38:27,350
You've been granted a semester's
time to run this college.

1285
01:38:27,370 --> 01:38:29,150
However some conditions
need to be fulfilled.

1286
01:38:29,330 --> 01:38:31,650
College Infrastructure
and faculty.

1287
01:38:32,050 --> 01:38:33,580
Academic performance.

1288
01:38:33,620 --> 01:38:37,210
Overall Excellence in Sports
and Cultural activities

1289
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:40,280
...with cent percent
attendance and results.

1290
01:38:41,420 --> 01:38:43,670
Even if one of these
criteria remain unfulfilled,

1291
01:38:43,820 --> 01:38:46,350
...the board has decided to pull
the shutters on this college.

1292
01:38:47,770 --> 01:38:50,880
If I come across any form of
drugs or criminal activities,

1293
01:38:51,020 --> 01:38:53,080
I will have the college
closed right there.

1294
01:38:54,650 --> 01:38:57,580
I'll have to inspect the present
condition of the college.

1295
01:38:59,710 --> 01:39:02,480
Maybe if you give these
books to a scrap dealer,

1296
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:05,270
...we might be able to raise
some funds for the college.

1297
01:39:06,310 --> 01:39:08,920
Namaskara sir!
- What is this?!

1298
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:12,960
Erm.. This is a classroom.
- Looks like a cowshed to me!

1299
01:39:13,720 --> 01:39:14,810
You.. Wake up!

1300
01:39:14,830 --> 01:39:17,720
Perfect place to binge and
fall into a deep slumber!

1301
01:39:17,900 --> 01:39:20,500
Where are we heading now?
- To the Engineering block sir.

1302
01:39:21,150 --> 01:39:23,180
Your college is in
a great condition.

1303
01:39:28,240 --> 01:39:30,540
Looks like a student has been
sneaking in for some fun.

1304
01:39:30,570 --> 01:39:32,700
Students have 1.5GB
of free daily data.

1305
01:39:32,730 --> 01:39:34,360
They'll have fun
on their mobiles.

1306
01:39:34,630 --> 01:39:38,310
This isn't the job of your students.
Must be one of your staff members.

1307
01:39:41,370 --> 01:39:43,600
Today's youth won't have
such deplorable taste.

1308
01:39:44,660 --> 01:39:46,820
He'll take another ten
minutes to take off his shirt.

1309
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:50,630
Your college is as empty as
Karnataka was during the pandemic.

1310
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:53,000
Till date,
I've shut down 49 colleges and

1311
01:39:53,030 --> 01:39:55,420
...you've worked
for 49 long years.

1312
01:39:55,670 --> 01:40:00,390
Time won't decide who'll hit
half century first, I will.

1313
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:07,540
He nit-picks and finds faults in
everything without even looking at it.

1314
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:09,810
All he wants to do is
shut this college down.

1315
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:14,890
Shathrugan Salimath is in.

1316
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:17,730
As an Investigation officer,
he'll do our job for us.

1317
01:40:18,820 --> 01:40:20,280
He'll surely shut
the college down.

1318
01:40:21,620 --> 01:40:24,210
He has already pulled the shutters
on many Government colleges.

1319
01:40:29,810 --> 01:40:31,210
Good Morning Sir! [IN UNISON]

1320
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:35,560
Keep walking.

1321
01:40:38,300 --> 01:40:40,680
Professor's here.
- Morning sir.

1322
01:40:42,030 --> 01:40:43,530
Wake up. The Professor's here.

1323
01:40:44,300 --> 01:40:46,340
Good Morning Sir!
- Good Morning

1324
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:50,010
The strength of
this class is 78.

1325
01:40:51,170 --> 01:40:53,580
The strength of this class is 78!
Am I right?!

1326
01:40:53,790 --> 01:40:54,820
Yes sir.

1327
01:40:55,050 --> 01:40:57,410
But it's only us who regularly
attend the Maths class.

1328
01:40:57,440 --> 01:40:59,130
Post-break no one
attends the classes.

1329
01:40:59,150 --> 01:41:00,430
They bunk the classes together.

1330
01:41:17,810 --> 01:41:19,810
One by two coffee for me, please.
- Sure sir.

1331
01:41:23,550 --> 01:41:26,140
All those who bunked the
Engineering Maths class.

1332
01:41:26,310 --> 01:41:27,390
Raise your hands.

1333
01:41:30,350 --> 01:41:33,070
Move to this row. Keep moving.

1334
01:41:33,100 --> 01:41:34,450
What's happening?

1335
01:41:39,330 --> 01:41:40,820
Come fast.

1336
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:43,420
Once I pull the shutters,
this is what their future will look like.

1337
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:45,610
I learnt that eighty percent
of my students are here.

1338
01:41:45,770 --> 01:41:48,200
I want my first maths
class to be full.

1339
01:41:48,230 --> 01:41:49,430
So, I'm here.

1340
01:41:49,660 --> 01:41:51,280
I'm used to a Houseful crowd.

1341
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:52,790
Okay?

1342
01:41:52,970 --> 01:41:55,970
Eigenvalues.
A very simple topic in Mathematics.

1343
01:42:02,050 --> 01:42:05,200
I'm done with the theory.
Let's solve the problems together.

1344
01:42:06,620 --> 01:42:08,280
This is utter nonsense!
- Thank you.

1345
01:42:08,470 --> 01:42:10,280
The other half?
- Give it to madam.

1346
01:42:10,620 --> 01:42:12,490
And bill it to my account.

1347
01:42:18,040 --> 01:42:20,850
If only our teachers too had
come to us and taught us,

1348
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:22,990
...all of us would
have prospered in life.

1349
01:42:25,680 --> 01:42:26,930
You'll have your lessons here.

1350
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:29,130
Enough practising multiplication.
Time to learn more.

1351
01:42:29,860 --> 01:42:32,170
About the attendance.
- Improve...

1352
01:42:33,100 --> 01:42:34,250
Nonsense.

1353
01:42:36,460 --> 01:42:38,410
I need a minute to
do my number one.

1354
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:40,010
There'll be some
students in there too.

1355
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:41,720
No right? We're not going in.

1356
01:42:41,740 --> 01:42:43,890
You shouldn't bother someone
who's kissing or pissing.

1357
01:43:01,470 --> 01:43:03,210
The producer of
OM is right there.

1358
01:43:03,230 --> 01:43:06,670
I LOVE YOU [POPULAR
TRACK FROM OM]

1359
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:11,270
YOU MUST LOVE ME...

1360
01:43:23,730 --> 01:43:26,280
In another ten minutes,
the second half of the film will begin.

1361
01:43:26,310 --> 01:43:29,140
By then I'll write down
the important topics.

1362
01:43:29,160 --> 01:43:31,650
Read it up.
If you've any doubts...

1363
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:34,580
Feel free to ask me in college or
class, I'm available anytime.

1364
01:43:36,260 --> 01:43:37,810
Sir...
- Thank you.

1365
01:43:43,730 --> 01:43:45,210
Dude, that's your father...

1366
01:43:56,440 --> 01:43:57,540
Dad...?

1367
01:43:59,090 --> 01:44:01,200
You'd told me that you're
a manager at a restaurant.

1368
01:44:01,620 --> 01:44:03,450
Is this where you work?
In the theatre?

1369
01:44:08,760 --> 01:44:11,330
Come home in the evening.
We'll talk.

1370
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:22,180
Shocked to see your
father working here?

1371
01:44:22,340 --> 01:44:24,820
He too would've been
shocked to see you here.

1372
01:44:26,090 --> 01:44:28,030
He believes you're
in the college.

1373
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:30,810
You believe that he's a
manager at a restaurant.

1374
01:44:31,220 --> 01:44:34,490
His place of work might be a lie.
But his intentions are not false.

1375
01:44:35,390 --> 01:44:37,880
But his belief of you being
in the college, is a lie.

1376
01:44:39,180 --> 01:44:43,470
He hid his workplace because he didn't want
his son to know the hardships he faces.

1377
01:44:43,790 --> 01:44:45,190
Not because he's ashamed of it.

1378
01:44:45,610 --> 01:44:47,800
Your parents too work
hard to earn money.

1379
01:44:48,520 --> 01:44:50,950
They never talk about
their hardships with you.

1380
01:44:53,950 --> 01:44:55,310
That's a branded t-shirt, right?

1381
01:44:55,940 --> 01:44:57,710
Must have cost you what,
two thousand bucks?

1382
01:44:57,730 --> 01:45:00,570
They got it because you asked for
it, even if they couldn't afford it.

1383
01:45:01,480 --> 01:45:04,080
Hasn't it been over a year since
your father got a new footwear?

1384
01:45:05,330 --> 01:45:07,360
Any idea at all,
what the size of his footwear is?

1385
01:45:10,630 --> 01:45:12,820
None of you know about the
troubles they go through.

1386
01:45:13,180 --> 01:45:15,470
The medicines they take,
the pressures they face

1387
01:45:15,490 --> 01:45:18,050
...and their commitments,
are all alien to you.

1388
01:45:18,830 --> 01:45:21,520
Your attendance is the answer
to the trust they have in you.

1389
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:26,170
Only when they work hard and pay the
fee will the college pay my salary.

1390
01:45:27,820 --> 01:45:31,040
Shouldn't I be loyal to
the hardships they face?

1391
01:45:32,130 --> 01:45:33,360
That is why I'm here.

1392
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:38,650
The movie will
start anytime now.

1393
01:45:38,870 --> 01:45:40,870
The money spent on the
ticket is hard-earned too.

1394
01:45:40,890 --> 01:45:42,980
Go ahead. Don't waste it.

1395
01:45:57,800 --> 01:45:59,410
Good Morning Sir. - Huh?!

1396
01:45:59,430 --> 01:46:00,630
Morning sir!

1397
01:46:01,250 --> 01:46:02,840
Take your seats everyone.

1398
01:46:07,190 --> 01:46:08,740
I'll meet you at the coaching.
- Sir...

1399
01:46:08,770 --> 01:46:10,660
The class is full.
Start with your lecture.

1400
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:14,330
Weren't you deducting
points until now?

1401
01:46:14,350 --> 01:46:16,070
Time to add points from today.

1402
01:46:16,100 --> 01:46:17,130
Look around you!

1403
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:22,970
Animals are superior in morals,
Man is beneath them all.

1404
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:24,800
He refuses to be a kind being...

1405
01:46:24,820 --> 01:46:27,260
It was my father who
wrote this song...

1406
01:46:27,910 --> 01:46:29,710
And it was my father
who sang the song...

1407
01:46:34,590 --> 01:46:36,550
Good Morning Sir [IN UNISON]
- Good Morning.

1408
01:46:40,910 --> 01:46:43,580
Today's Friday sir.
Six movies have released in the theatres.

1409
01:46:43,730 --> 01:46:46,420
But it is our college
that is Houseful.

1410
01:46:46,470 --> 01:46:47,560
You heard it right.

1411
01:46:47,590 --> 01:46:50,210
We've made History.
History classes too are fully packed.

1412
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:51,970
All thanks to Professor
Raj's actions.

1413
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:55,460
Guys in the last bench.
Move to the front.

1414
01:46:56,210 --> 01:46:58,510
You guys move to the last bench.

1415
01:46:58,700 --> 01:47:01,100
Sit in the front,
and all you'll see is the black board.

1416
01:47:01,120 --> 01:47:03,300
Move to the last bench,
and you'll see the whole world.

1417
01:47:03,320 --> 01:47:05,530
One needs to have knowledge
and awareness of this world.

1418
01:47:05,550 --> 01:47:07,530
Are you saying that
we have no knowledge?!

1419
01:47:09,210 --> 01:47:10,620
You're absolutely right.

1420
01:47:10,930 --> 01:47:12,120
Don't wipe it off sir.

1421
01:47:12,190 --> 01:47:13,830
I didn't understand
what madam taught us.

1422
01:47:13,860 --> 01:47:15,140
I'll copy it down in my notes.

1423
01:47:15,160 --> 01:47:16,850
Quit playing PUBG
and you'll get it.

1424
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,520
It's not that sir.
I'm a Kannada medium student.

1425
01:47:19,550 --> 01:47:21,490
I didn't quiet
catch her English.

1426
01:47:21,510 --> 01:47:22,590
Fine.

1427
01:47:22,610 --> 01:47:24,940
I'll teach you in Kannada.
Pay attention.

1428
01:47:25,140 --> 01:47:28,200
Let's consider this chalk
piece is a beam structure.

1429
01:47:28,360 --> 01:47:31,890
If you squeeze it on both the sides,
it's called compression stress.

1430
01:47:32,050 --> 01:47:35,160
If you stretch and add tension on both
the sides, it's called tensile stress.

1431
01:47:35,740 --> 01:47:37,200
I understood it perfectly sir.

1432
01:47:37,650 --> 01:47:39,710
Madam, could you explain
it in Kannada once?

1433
01:47:39,820 --> 01:47:41,960
Everyone in this class
understands English.

1434
01:47:42,150 --> 01:47:44,510
I can't explain it in
Kannada just for one guy.

1435
01:47:44,540 --> 01:47:46,860
When the Maths professor
can, why can't you?

1436
01:47:46,890 --> 01:47:49,310
I can't teach with students like
you guys in the first bench.

1437
01:47:49,340 --> 01:47:50,340
But why, sir?

1438
01:47:50,370 --> 01:47:52,670
It's no big deal to help
distinction students score ranks.

1439
01:47:52,690 --> 01:47:55,460
The challenge lies in helping below
average students gain distinction.

1440
01:47:55,480 --> 01:47:57,640
Give it a try sir! - Idiot!

1441
01:48:25,890 --> 01:48:28,580
If everything is taught in
Kannada, how will they progress?

1442
01:48:28,610 --> 01:48:31,300
If they prefer Kannada,
Kannada is what they should be taught in.

1443
01:48:31,680 --> 01:48:34,710
English is merely a language,
not a measure of Knowledge.

1444
01:48:38,420 --> 01:48:39,630
Sorry sir.

1445
01:48:40,950 --> 01:48:43,340
What are you looking at?
Go play with them.

1446
01:49:05,330 --> 01:49:08,390
Yuvaraj, half of your students
are unfit to donate blood.

1447
01:49:08,410 --> 01:49:09,520
They're drunk.

1448
01:49:12,740 --> 01:49:14,930
Woah Madam! Don't you doubt me.

1449
01:49:15,080 --> 01:49:17,660
Millions have worshipped
and adored this bloodline.

1450
01:49:17,690 --> 01:49:19,970
Preserve it with care.
It's extremely valuable.

1451
01:49:19,990 --> 01:49:21,060
Where's my apple?

1452
01:49:22,240 --> 01:49:23,350
Have fun.

1453
01:49:23,380 --> 01:49:26,020
But with your own money,
not with your parents' money.

1454
01:49:41,330 --> 01:49:43,150
If you lose a girl,
make way for another one.

1455
01:49:43,170 --> 01:49:44,750
Like you do for your
Supplementary exam.

1456
01:49:45,290 --> 01:49:47,400
Did you come looking for me?
- Yes.

1457
01:49:52,170 --> 01:49:54,700
Did you not mock me about
my dove flying away?

1458
01:49:54,730 --> 01:49:57,720
The dove will always return to
where it belongs. On my shoulder.

1459
01:49:57,750 --> 01:49:58,840
Got it Mr. Curls?!

1460
01:50:13,850 --> 01:50:15,400
There once lived a
King in his kingdom

1461
01:50:15,420 --> 01:50:17,260
The King had a Queen

1462
01:50:17,290 --> 01:50:21,040
If the duo decides to marry, life will
be an ecstatic blend of Milk and Honey

1463
01:50:21,070 --> 01:50:24,640
A marriage is like a Maruthi Van;
All that transpires inside is chaos

1464
01:50:24,660 --> 01:50:28,570
Make way for the rest of
the family to join the ride

1465
01:50:28,840 --> 01:50:32,880
Quick!
Hurry and book a wedding hall

1466
01:50:33,190 --> 01:50:36,140
Make some noise at the
reception with the orchestra

1467
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:39,760
All those freeloaders who get on
the state grooving to the music

1468
01:50:39,780 --> 01:50:43,350
Yet wish the couple empty
handed are heartless people

1469
01:50:58,810 --> 01:51:00,400
There once lived a
King in his kingdom

1470
01:51:00,430 --> 01:51:02,220
The King had a Queen

1471
01:51:02,250 --> 01:51:06,040
If the duo decides to marry, life will
be an ecstatic blend of Milk and Honey

1472
01:51:06,060 --> 01:51:09,690
A marriage is like a Maruthi Van;
All that follow inside it is chaos

1473
01:51:09,720 --> 01:51:13,530
Make way for the rest of
the family to join the ride

1474
01:51:58,410 --> 01:52:02,500
Come honeymoon and the groom
turns into a romantic hero

1475
01:52:02,530 --> 01:52:06,020
Come family matters and he
turns into an action star

1476
01:52:06,040 --> 01:52:09,620
Life is fun when both love
and war is on the table

1477
01:52:09,640 --> 01:52:13,860
If it's your wife's birthday,
it's time for a holiday; make no mistake

1478
01:52:14,010 --> 01:52:17,590
Donâ€™t we leave our
parents behind for you?

1479
01:52:17,610 --> 01:52:21,250
And yet you canâ€™t let
go of booze and boys?!

1480
01:52:21,270 --> 01:52:24,760
Think before you tie the knots

1481
01:52:24,790 --> 01:52:28,630
For it brings no good
to marry in haste

1482
01:53:11,350 --> 01:53:15,370
They've intentionally scheduled all our
matches against theirs in the tournament..

1483
01:53:15,810 --> 01:53:19,520
They're going all the way
to defeat us on the field.

1484
01:53:21,210 --> 01:53:24,580
Our win should be a fitting
reply to them and this society.

1485
01:53:25,190 --> 01:53:26,320
Make sure...

1486
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:30,550
You rise against all odds.
Never ever give up!

1487
01:53:50,330 --> 01:53:52,000
Get lost from here.

1488
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:56,070
Manju, we're selecting the team
for the Girls' Kho Kho team.

1489
01:53:56,090 --> 01:53:57,680
Send the boys away.
- Madam...?

1490
01:53:58,160 --> 01:54:01,760
You think these guys cared for
Tennis when Sania Mirza was playing?

1491
01:54:01,780 --> 01:54:03,070
Send them out! - Okay madam.

1492
01:54:03,090 --> 01:54:05,030
Leave the place!
- Come on girls!

1493
01:54:05,780 --> 01:54:08,350
For years, our college has
been the Cricket Champions.

1494
01:54:08,380 --> 01:54:10,110
This is a very
prestigious tournament!

1495
01:54:10,140 --> 01:54:11,560
So, give it your best.

1496
01:54:11,930 --> 01:54:13,110
Pick your team. - Yes sir.

1497
01:54:13,130 --> 01:54:14,250
Sir...

1498
01:54:14,740 --> 01:54:16,160
We already have a team.

1499
01:54:16,570 --> 01:54:18,540
Didn't you tell him about us?

1500
01:54:19,480 --> 01:54:21,380
Our Engineering team
is strong enough, sir.

1501
01:54:21,410 --> 01:54:22,660
Why should we play with these

1502
01:54:22,690 --> 01:54:24,150
...good-for-nothing
degree students?

1503
01:54:24,180 --> 01:54:26,070
Sir, why should we play
with these Mechanics,

1504
01:54:26,100 --> 01:54:28,030
Computer Operators
and Contractors?

1505
01:54:28,060 --> 01:54:29,460
The roads are full of them.

1506
01:54:29,480 --> 01:54:31,560
And they're all driving cabs
with no other job to do.

1507
01:54:31,590 --> 01:54:32,840
Yet there's no dearth of pride!

1508
01:54:32,860 --> 01:54:36,590
Sir, we're Medical students.
They're all our patients.

1509
01:54:36,630 --> 01:54:38,170
How can we team up with
them, sir?

1510
01:54:38,190 --> 01:54:39,960
Scumbags!
You're supposed to treat patients.

1511
01:54:39,980 --> 01:54:41,700
Not like doctors
operate only on doctors!

1512
01:54:41,730 --> 01:54:43,140
Varun! Leave it!

1513
01:54:43,270 --> 01:54:46,040
Sir, either the Engineering
team gets to play exclusively.

1514
01:54:46,070 --> 01:54:47,870
Or else we're not playing.

1515
01:54:47,890 --> 01:54:49,470
He's right!
We will not be playing.

1516
01:54:49,500 --> 01:54:52,300
We're also not going to play!
- Not like we care either!

1517
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:55,280
This is an Inter-college
tournament.

1518
01:54:55,560 --> 01:54:57,650
Not your Intra-college
tournament.

1519
01:54:58,050 --> 01:55:00,970
You've to represent the college,
not your individual branches.

1520
01:55:01,010 --> 01:55:02,670
Clearly you don't
care for the college.

1521
01:55:03,050 --> 01:55:05,980
Either let go of these petty
differences and play for your college.

1522
01:55:06,510 --> 01:55:09,340
Otherwise, you're all out!

1523
01:55:14,040 --> 01:55:15,680
Dude, come back!

1524
01:55:16,820 --> 01:55:17,990
Mister!

1525
01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:20,680
You could've convinced them
and formed a team, right?

1526
01:55:21,030 --> 01:55:23,920
This team will be a random mix of
players with different mindsets.

1527
01:55:24,100 --> 01:55:26,280
They'll spoil the
sport with their egos.

1528
01:55:26,300 --> 01:55:28,790
Owing to attendance issues,
students hardly turn up.

1529
01:55:28,810 --> 01:55:30,740
You sent away those who
were willing to play.

1530
01:55:30,770 --> 01:55:34,240
I'm the Sports HOD for namesake.
Forget about the sports selections.

1531
01:55:42,730 --> 01:55:45,680
Sir, we've to attend the
sports practice sessions.

1532
01:55:45,700 --> 01:55:48,790
If you fall short on attendance, hall
ticket for your exams will not be given.

1533
01:55:48,820 --> 01:55:51,390
Yuvaraj sir will take care of that.
- What?

1534
01:55:54,980 --> 01:55:56,480
Hello everyone.
- Good Morning Sir.

1535
01:55:56,510 --> 01:55:58,880
I'm Inspector Azad,
an alumnus of this college

1536
01:55:58,910 --> 01:56:00,440
...and a State level
Kabbaddi player.

1537
01:56:01,010 --> 01:56:03,260
I've voluntarily come
to coach your team.

1538
01:56:03,290 --> 01:56:05,810
All the very best!
- Thank you sir.

1539
01:56:07,960 --> 01:56:10,960
Cover him!
Get hold of him!

1540
01:56:11,970 --> 01:56:14,220
Hope the practice sessions are going well.
- Yes sir.

1541
01:56:14,250 --> 01:56:15,470
Except for Cricket.

1542
01:56:16,860 --> 01:56:19,020
The players come to the
grounds but don't practice.

1543
01:56:19,050 --> 01:56:22,510
Sir, all the other sport teams are
practising, what about Cricket?

1544
01:56:23,150 --> 01:56:24,570
Let them be dude!

1545
01:56:24,740 --> 01:56:25,790
Tell me sir.

1546
01:56:25,820 --> 01:56:29,480
The Cricket team's ready.
- Sir, what are you saying?

1547
01:56:45,590 --> 01:56:46,840
What are the girls doing here?

1548
01:56:57,430 --> 01:56:58,560
Huh?!

1549
01:56:58,580 --> 01:57:01,170
The girl's team?!
But how?

1550
01:57:01,200 --> 01:57:02,570
Don't doubt them boy!

1551
01:57:02,600 --> 01:57:04,850
We have women who can drive
BMTC buses in the city today,

1552
01:57:04,870 --> 01:57:06,340
Cricket will be a
cake walk for them.

1553
01:57:06,480 --> 01:57:07,570
Piece of cake!

1554
01:57:07,600 --> 01:57:10,720
They're participating in various
cultural and sports activities.

1555
01:57:10,750 --> 01:57:12,310
They'll play Cricket too.

1556
01:57:12,340 --> 01:57:13,530
For their college.

1557
01:57:13,730 --> 01:57:16,310
Don't worry.
Girls are great at multitasking!

1558
01:57:16,710 --> 01:57:19,600
You...
have to coach the Girls' team.

1559
01:57:20,490 --> 01:57:22,020
Cricket is my passion sir.

1560
01:57:22,640 --> 01:57:24,270
Doesn't matter if I
don't get to play.

1561
01:57:24,620 --> 01:57:26,040
Our college should win.

1562
01:57:26,410 --> 01:57:28,830
I'll coach them sir.
- That's the spirit!

1563
01:57:28,850 --> 01:57:31,240
Mister! Instead of using all
those prepared players...

1564
01:57:31,260 --> 01:57:32,500
You want these girls to play?

1565
01:57:32,520 --> 01:57:34,740
What qualities did
you see in them?!

1566
01:57:34,770 --> 01:57:36,540
They revere their college.

1567
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:38,860
They're spirited enough to
be sportive in the games.

1568
01:57:38,880 --> 01:57:40,380
Girls practice well.

1569
01:57:40,400 --> 01:57:43,430
Madam, whether it's the boys or the
girls, the cup remains the same.

1570
01:57:43,780 --> 01:57:46,490
This time, the cup is ours!
- Sure sir!

1571
01:57:59,320 --> 01:58:00,420
Bullshit!

1572
01:58:02,040 --> 01:58:04,600
This should be your footwork...
Hold the seam like this...

1573
01:58:05,940 --> 01:58:08,470
These girls couldn't stand each other
in their own homes during lockdown.

1574
01:58:08,500 --> 01:58:10,520
...and they expect eleven
of them to play Cricket?

1575
01:58:10,540 --> 01:58:12,380
Women are strong,
but can easily be wronged.

1576
01:58:18,590 --> 01:58:21,160
You should be setting the
trend, not follow it.

1577
01:58:24,300 --> 01:58:27,030
A real guru leads his students to
the right path, not mislead them.

1578
01:58:27,170 --> 01:58:30,980
Your college has hundreds of students.
A couple of failures won't matter.

1579
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:32,450
I only have one son.

1580
01:58:32,630 --> 01:58:35,440
Don't sacrifice the lives of
our children for your college.

1581
01:58:37,670 --> 01:58:39,580
Even if parents fail
to correct their children,

1582
01:58:39,600 --> 01:58:41,250
...a Guru is trusted to do their job.

1583
01:58:41,270 --> 01:58:42,340
And what are you doing?!

1584
01:58:54,630 --> 01:58:57,360
Forty students in this batch stand
no chance of clearing their exams.

1585
01:58:57,390 --> 01:59:00,440
Your son and your
daughter is one of them.

1586
01:59:00,790 --> 01:59:03,100
You know your children
are weak in Maths.

1587
01:59:03,350 --> 01:59:05,250
There's no point in
encouraging them

1588
01:59:05,280 --> 01:59:08,000
...to take part in cultural
and sports activities.

1589
01:59:08,040 --> 01:59:09,320
They'll lose their way.

1590
01:59:09,680 --> 01:59:12,930
Only you can save your children
from Professor Yuvaraj.

1591
01:59:15,620 --> 01:59:17,990
All these trophies were
won a couple of years ago.

1592
01:59:18,550 --> 01:59:20,780
Sir, you promised attendance
and encouraged students to

1593
01:59:20,810 --> 01:59:22,880
...take part in extra-curricular
activities, right?

1594
01:59:22,900 --> 01:59:24,760
Their parents are here
and are opposing it.

1595
01:59:25,470 --> 01:59:27,650
It's enough if my son
studies and passes his exam.

1596
01:59:27,670 --> 01:59:29,860
There's no need
for him to dance.

1597
01:59:29,880 --> 01:59:32,900
We strive at our jobs,
at bringing them up and to pay their fees.

1598
01:59:32,930 --> 01:59:34,940
My daughter shouldn't be singing.
Let her study.

1599
01:59:34,970 --> 01:59:37,770
Is it enough to pay the fees?
Can't you help them study?

1600
01:59:37,800 --> 01:59:39,350
Do you expect us
to study with them?

1601
01:59:39,380 --> 01:59:41,480
We could never study.
Our kids will have to.

1602
01:59:41,510 --> 01:59:43,400
Our children should listen to us.

1603
01:59:43,420 --> 01:59:44,700
We conceived them.

1604
01:59:44,720 --> 01:59:45,760
And we bred them.

1605
01:59:45,780 --> 01:59:47,570
Damn! What are you guys saying?

1606
01:59:47,590 --> 01:59:49,830
Lady, you conceived them.
Sir, you bred them.

1607
01:59:49,850 --> 01:59:51,620
Don't mix up things at your whim!

1608
01:59:51,640 --> 01:59:55,200
Children of today are of no use.
They have no sense of responsibility.

1609
01:59:55,220 --> 01:59:58,330
All they do is watch movies and
roam around with their friends.

1610
01:59:58,360 --> 02:00:00,160
What were you up to
in your college days?

1611
02:00:00,190 --> 02:00:01,900
Did you never bunk your classes?

1612
02:00:02,450 --> 02:00:04,600
You've had your share
of fun in your youth,

1613
02:00:04,630 --> 02:00:07,330
...but stop your
kids from having fun.

1614
02:00:07,350 --> 02:00:08,480
Isn't that unfair?

1615
02:00:08,500 --> 02:00:10,730
If our kids fail tomorrow,
you're responsible.

1616
02:00:10,760 --> 02:00:13,260
When ones tries to learn
something that is beyond them,

1617
02:00:13,290 --> 02:00:15,680
...one is bound to fail.
Just like you guys did.

1618
02:00:15,700 --> 02:00:18,610
We failed or quit studies because
we didn't have anyone to support us.

1619
02:00:18,630 --> 02:00:20,140
Not because we
weren't capable of it.

1620
02:00:20,160 --> 02:00:22,020
We will fare better
than our kids ever would.

1621
02:00:22,040 --> 02:00:24,010
We understand the value
of life better than them.

1622
02:00:24,030 --> 02:00:25,540
She's right. [IN UNSION]
- Go on then!

1623
02:00:25,570 --> 02:00:27,390
If you're interested,
I'll help you study.

1624
02:00:28,880 --> 02:00:30,710
Education doesn't have an age limit.

1625
02:00:31,470 --> 02:00:34,350
What do you mean?!
Are you underestimating us?!

1626
02:00:34,370 --> 02:00:37,470
What he means to say is...
- We will study and pass the test!

1627
02:00:37,500 --> 02:00:40,580
If we study and get through the test,
you shouldn't mess with our kids.

1628
02:00:40,600 --> 02:00:42,240
Now you're talking!

1629
02:00:42,330 --> 02:00:43,700
It's Parents V/S Children now!

1630
02:00:43,720 --> 02:00:45,740
Join us. Study well.

1631
02:00:46,340 --> 02:00:50,040
You'll understand today's education
system and the pressure it comes with.

1632
02:00:50,070 --> 02:00:52,500
Not like we haven't faced
enough pressure in our lives.

1633
02:00:52,520 --> 02:00:54,310
Even if one of us
manages to pass,

1634
02:00:54,340 --> 02:00:56,800
...you should never meddle in
the lives of our children again.

1635
02:00:56,830 --> 02:00:59,330
And if we fail,
we will not question your methods.

1636
02:00:59,630 --> 02:01:02,370
What do you have to say?
- Yes. She's right [IN UNISON]

1637
02:01:04,930 --> 02:01:07,870
Mr. Kanteerava.
Get them enrolled in our evening college.

1638
02:01:08,010 --> 02:01:09,220
Sir, but how will they...

1639
02:01:09,250 --> 02:01:11,570
Okay everyone.
See you in college.

1640
02:01:11,660 --> 02:01:13,470
What?!
- Does he really expect us to come?

1641
02:01:13,500 --> 02:01:16,210
What is he doing!?
- What just happened?

1642
02:01:16,230 --> 02:01:23,040
The puppet master got tired of
the act and ended the performance.

1643
02:01:25,690 --> 02:01:27,220
Oh lord! Poor them!

1644
02:01:32,980 --> 02:01:34,610
Do you have change
for two hundred bucks?

1645
02:01:34,640 --> 02:01:37,540
Madam, aren't we classmates?
Why bring money in between?

1646
02:01:37,570 --> 02:01:38,720
It's okay. Let's go.

1647
02:01:58,490 --> 02:02:01,160
Namaste
- Namaskara...

1648
02:02:01,690 --> 02:02:04,090
I'm from Sringeri...
- And I'm from Kengeri!

1649
02:02:05,450 --> 02:02:06,960
cosÎ¸+isinÎ¸...

1650
02:02:06,980 --> 02:02:10,630
I was hoping to learn about adding,
subtracting and dividing in Mathematics.

1651
02:02:10,650 --> 02:02:12,120
What in the hell is Theta?

1652
02:02:12,140 --> 02:02:14,940
This is exactly what
our kids are studying.

1653
02:02:16,590 --> 02:02:17,780
Excuse me?

1654
02:02:17,810 --> 02:02:20,450
I couldn't manage to catch the
show, 'Nandini' last night.

1655
02:02:20,480 --> 02:02:22,220
Five minutes and I'll
skim through the show.

1656
02:02:22,240 --> 02:02:24,970
You write it down.
I'll copy it from you later.

1657
02:02:31,120 --> 02:02:34,040
This is an important topic.
Please make note of it.

1658
02:02:35,250 --> 02:02:36,790
He's the security
guard of my company.

1659
02:02:36,810 --> 02:02:39,290
He's doing the exact job
he does back at work.

1660
02:02:39,320 --> 02:02:40,470
Sir?

1661
02:02:41,690 --> 02:02:42,980
Sir...?
- Master!

1662
02:02:43,520 --> 02:02:45,760
This is an important topic.
Make note of it.

1663
02:02:45,780 --> 02:02:49,460
We asked him to mould our children,
and this guy's onto grinding us.

1664
02:02:49,490 --> 02:02:51,820
Like we've been thrown
into a grinding stone!

1665
02:02:52,990 --> 02:02:54,890
You've dissolved a
Champion Cricket team and

1666
02:02:54,920 --> 02:02:56,880
...are making the girls
represent our college.

1667
02:02:57,620 --> 02:02:59,820
You've pushed parents
into classrooms and

1668
02:02:59,840 --> 02:03:01,940
...have granted attendance
to those bunking classes.

1669
02:03:01,970 --> 02:03:03,080
What's happening here?

1670
02:03:03,530 --> 02:03:04,930
Everything is normal sir.

1671
02:03:05,010 --> 02:03:07,480
If there's no team spirit,
Champions are no less than losers.

1672
02:03:07,780 --> 02:03:09,190
The girls are very spirited.

1673
02:03:09,210 --> 02:03:11,870
I'm granting attendance only
to those who are interested

1674
02:03:11,890 --> 02:03:14,270
...in sports and culture
activities but lack support.

1675
02:03:14,970 --> 02:03:16,950
Parents need to
understand their children.

1676
02:03:16,970 --> 02:03:18,830
The interested ones will
study no matter what.

1677
02:03:18,890 --> 02:03:22,030
And we side-line those who
don't study as failures.

1678
02:03:23,400 --> 02:03:25,900
Every one of us has been blessed
with a unique capability.

As teachers, it's our job to
identify, encourage and shape them.

1680

If the world shunned those who
didn't have formal education...

Kuvempu, Dr. Rajkumar go?

1684
02:03:40,710 --> 02:03:43,260
Without them our childhood
would have been meaningless.

1685
02:03:44,340 --> 02:03:47,680
Failure in examinations don't matter,
but one shouldn't fail in life, sir.

1686
02:03:54,800 --> 02:03:57,450
From giving birth to getting them to
study, our struggle is real.

1687
02:03:57,480 --> 02:04:01,360
I don't know about the others,
but we shouldn't give up on our children.

1688
02:04:01,390 --> 02:04:02,400
You're right.

You never managed to woo Pooja.

And now, looks like your
dad's winning over her mother.

Here's my childhood photo.

Let's say your dad's
successful in wooing her,

forget your chances
of hitting on Pooja.

1697
02:04:23,030 --> 02:04:24,670

Make a note!

1704
02:04:45,400 --> 02:04:48,180
I'll ride all the way to
K.R.Puram and Whitefield twice.

1705
02:04:48,200 --> 02:04:50,280
I'll wait in the Silk board

Mom, they'll gain TRP from all
the time you spend on the shows.

We'll lose our value.

Dad, I'm the one who's
supposed to be singing.

You're supposed to be studying.

1724
02:05:37,360 --> 02:05:39,810
If you don't want me to sing,
you shouldn't be loafing around.

Going by the challenge,

Your worth will be decided
in tomorrow's test.

1737

What the hell are you saying?

1738
02:06:35,110 --> 02:06:37,380
Are you going to measure our
worth with your petty test?!

1739
02:06:37,410 --> 02:06:39,380
Are you telling us that
we've failed in life

1740
02:06:39,410 --> 02:06:42,070
...just because we didn't learn
a couple of lessons you taught us?

1741
02:06:42,090 --> 02:06:45,180
It's true that I wanted
to be an Engineer...

1742
02:06:45,200 --> 02:06:46,250
But I couldn't.

1743
02:06:46,280 --> 02:06:49,210
Instead... I started a grocery
store and earned millions.

1744
02:06:49,240 --> 02:06:51,130
How am I not worthy enough?!

1745
02:06:51,150 --> 02:06:54,270
Your textbooks are unfit
to measure our worth.

It will never come
close to my Almanac.

hour long examination?

You think you can whip up
delicious dishes like I can?

Can you stitch clothes
to perfection like I can?

1752
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:14,290
We took up this challenge
to ensure our kids study.

1753
02:07:14,320 --> 02:07:17,330
And you think you can decide
if we're worthy or not?

1754
02:07:17,350 --> 02:07:22,150

the worth or capabilities of others.

There's a dancer among your kids.
Chemistry serves no purpose to her.

There are athletes

1763

They need physical fitness.
Not theories of Physics.

02:07:54,670 --> 02:07:56,930
Sure it's great for them
if they score good marks.

But if they don't, make sure you
don't crush their self-confidence.

Don't judge them.

With the pretext of exams,
don't push them away from their dreams.

believing they play or sing well.

When it's time for their SSLC exams,
you cut them off from everything.

Even kids will chase this puny target in
minutes.

02:09:48,200 --> 02:09:50,790
I wouldn't have played if I knew
we were playing against girls.

1799
02:09:50,820 --> 02:09:52,660
These girls screwed our
college's reputation.

If only they'd let us play...
- What a dreadful loss!

You pit our girls against
professional cricketers!

What are you trying to prove?

1803
02:10:04,720 --> 02:10:07,780
Are you trying to bring shame
to our girls and our college?

1804
02:10:07,800 --> 02:10:09,220
Why did you pit the
girls against the boys?

1805
02:10:09,240 --> 02:10:11,390
Why in the hell did we come
to play with such players?

Show us what you're made of.
On the field!

We'll hit you where it hurts!
- Enough!

Please sir.
Give us a chance to play!

1814
02:10:32,410 --> 02:10:34,420

Let go of your fears, Oâ€™ Yuva

And you gotta last until
you emerge victorious

1834

02:13:43,820 --> 02:13:45,740
No matter what the challenge is

1845
02:13:45,760 --> 02:13:47,930
No matter from who
the challenge is

1846
02:13:48,070 --> 02:13:50,540
Face your opponent!

1847
02:13:50,560 --> 02:13:53,160
Donâ€™t ever turn
your back, Oâ€™ Yuva

1848
02:13:53,220 --> 02:13:55,630
Victory is nobodyâ€™s priced possession

1849
02:13:55,660 --> 02:13:57,600
Success doesn't belong to one man

1850
02:13:57,620 --> 02:14:02,310
Work hard and good days will be
yours, keep surging ahead Oâ€™ Yuva

1851
02:14:02,340 --> 02:14:06,530
Hey Yuva Yuva!

1852
02:14:06,880 --> 02:14:11,170
Walk with your collar high,
amidst those who mocked you

1853
02:14:11,770 --> 02:14:16,060
Hey Yuva Yuva!

1854
02:14:16,310 --> 02:14:21,040
Become the display picture in the
phones of those who doubted you

1855
02:14:21,340 --> 02:14:23,660
You gotta keep winning
until your last breath

1856
02:14:23,690 --> 02:14:26,190
And you gotta last until
you emerge victorious

1857
02:14:26,220 --> 02:14:30,500
Stay determined and kill those
who ridiculed you, with a smile

1858
02:14:31,520 --> 02:14:32,960
Power Of Youth

1859
02:14:36,230 --> 02:14:37,620
Power Of Youth

1860
02:14:40,710 --> 02:14:42,200
Power Of Youth

1861
02:15:24,780 --> 02:15:28,870
Those who do nothing but comment,
have nothing better to do in their lives

1862
02:15:29,140 --> 02:15:31,230
Pay no attention to such brickbats

1863
02:15:31,250 --> 02:15:33,860
For they stand nowhere in
comparison to you

1864
02:15:34,050 --> 02:15:38,090
Hey Yuva Yuva!

1865
02:15:38,260 --> 02:15:42,770
Letâ€™s keep those waiting for us to fail,
waiting forever

1866
02:15:43,330 --> 02:15:47,100
Hey Yuva Yuva!

1867
02:15:47,880 --> 02:15:52,330
Even if we fail the examinations,
letâ€™s build a great life

1868
02:15:52,530 --> 02:15:54,940
Make a name for yourself
that will leave a lasting impact

1869
02:15:55,050 --> 02:15:57,390
A name that will live on forever

1870
02:15:57,420 --> 02:16:00,000
Become the preface of History

1871
02:16:00,030 --> 02:16:01,670
Shout out loud

1872
02:16:01,700 --> 02:16:03,270
This is the Power of Youth!

1873
02:16:06,450 --> 02:16:07,940
Power of Youth

1874
02:16:20,260 --> 02:16:23,090
We welcome Bengaluru's DC,
Samarth Bhagwat, to the Semi-finals

1875
02:16:23,120 --> 02:16:26,640
Kabbaddi match of the Karnataka
State University Championship.

1876
02:16:36,400 --> 02:16:37,460
Azad...?

1877
02:16:38,450 --> 02:16:40,050
They're dehydrated!
Here's some Glucose

1878
02:16:52,230 --> 02:16:54,420
Kabbaddi...
- Come on boys!

1879
02:17:02,820 --> 02:17:04,900
What are you doing?!
- Let go of him!

1880
02:17:04,920 --> 02:17:06,180
Yuvaraj! Stop them!

1881
02:17:08,550 --> 02:17:10,710
Sharath! Don't do it...

1882
02:17:19,380 --> 02:17:20,910
Let go of me!

1883
02:17:23,580 --> 02:17:24,770
I will not spare you!

1884
02:17:27,350 --> 02:17:30,930
BREAKING NEWS: An untowardly incident
took place at the Karnataka State

1885
02:17:30,960 --> 02:17:34,010
University Championship Kabbaddi
Tournament during the match.

1886
02:17:34,040 --> 02:17:38,330
The players seemed to have
consumed drugs during the breaks

1887
02:17:38,350 --> 02:17:43,700
and we have now found the visuals of the
players physically attacking the opponents.

1888
02:17:43,720 --> 02:17:48,550
R K University's Kabbaddi players
and team have been disqualified

1889
02:17:48,580 --> 02:17:52,890
...from the Karnataka
State Kabbaddi Championship

1890
02:17:53,790 --> 02:17:55,750
RK University's
Kabbaddi team has been

1891
02:17:55,780 --> 02:17:57,700
disqualified due to
Narcotic activities.

1892
02:17:58,240 --> 02:18:02,930
Time won't decide who'll hit
the half century first, I will.

1893
02:18:05,340 --> 02:18:08,760
Rampant Drug Mafia in Government Colleges.
Will RK University face another lockdown?

1894
02:18:09,430 --> 02:18:11,300
Trust me! I'm very sure about this.

1895
02:18:11,620 --> 02:18:14,900
This is going to be the
breaking news of the day.

1896
02:18:40,450 --> 02:18:43,230
Nice to be back in
our hangout place.

1897
02:18:43,260 --> 02:18:47,090
It's great to know that you've been
promoted as the new Cabinet Secretariat.

1898
02:18:47,110 --> 02:18:48,580
I'm so proud of you Samarth.

1899
02:18:48,600 --> 02:18:51,830
You've shown that even those without a
wealthy background one can make it big.

1900
02:18:51,850 --> 02:18:53,910
Samarth, let's have a
drink before Sir gets here.

1901
02:18:53,930 --> 02:18:55,040
Let's cut the cake too.

1902
02:18:57,990 --> 02:18:59,060
Dude...

1903
02:19:01,740 --> 02:19:03,950
Samarth cut the cake now!

1904
02:19:05,590 --> 02:19:06,850
Thank you!

1905
02:19:07,550 --> 02:19:11,080
I miss our college days so much.
- So do we.

1906
02:19:11,100 --> 02:19:14,520
Doesn't this place remind
us of our college days?

1907
02:19:14,540 --> 02:19:16,770
Our college days were the
best days of our lives.

1908
02:19:42,030 --> 02:19:43,700
Look who's finally here!

1909
02:19:45,150 --> 02:19:47,110
You missed the champagne.
Have some cake instead.

1910
02:19:49,480 --> 02:19:52,360
How could you fail the
college for you to succeed?

1911
02:19:53,240 --> 02:19:56,080
You stomped down your own college
to climb up the ladder, didn't you?!

1912
02:19:56,110 --> 02:19:57,690
Dude, what are you saying?

1913
02:19:58,150 --> 02:20:00,850
Despite not being invited for
the Kabbaddi match you came;

1914
02:20:00,870 --> 02:20:03,360
...and I believed that
you were there as an alumni.

1915
02:20:04,380 --> 02:20:08,590
But you were there
as Antony Joseph's mole.

1916
02:20:11,140 --> 02:20:14,960
You revealed our strategies and strengths,
and ruined our plans, you idiot!

1917
02:20:14,990 --> 02:20:18,290
Yuvaraj, are you out of your mind?
- Why did you do this?!

1918
02:20:18,480 --> 02:20:20,460
How could you?!
- Let me go, dammit!

1919
02:20:20,490 --> 02:20:22,190
Samarth...
- What's happening?

1920
02:20:23,100 --> 02:20:24,270
You fraudster...!

1921
02:20:26,700 --> 02:20:29,490
How long will you
live on petty deals?

1922
02:20:29,790 --> 02:20:33,360
Land acquisition Commission...
Income Tax due fines...

1923
02:20:33,540 --> 02:20:35,330
There are bigger fishes to fry!

1924
02:20:47,280 --> 02:20:51,170
Help us out and we'll turn
your dreams into your reality.

1925
02:20:51,200 --> 02:20:54,200
Or else, your life will
remain as a dream forever.

1926
02:20:54,230 --> 02:20:56,090
You haven't taken your
salary in six months,

1927
02:20:56,110 --> 02:20:57,600
...yet you have a
car worth a crore.

1928
02:20:57,680 --> 02:21:00,540
You became a DC only a year ago,
yet you're the new Cabin Secretariat.

1929
02:21:00,570 --> 02:21:01,630
How is this possible?

1930
02:21:01,660 --> 02:21:05,120
You came by faking us your
support, and yet you stood by them.

1931
02:21:06,140 --> 02:21:08,300
Tell us. Speak up!

1932
02:21:09,410 --> 02:21:11,540
What is so wrong about this?!

1933
02:21:11,560 --> 02:21:13,880
I haven't committed any sin
for you to pound me like this!

1934
02:21:13,900 --> 02:21:16,520
My education gave me a
position and they paid for it.

1935
02:21:16,990 --> 02:21:19,850
Success is all that matters in
life, not how you succeeded!

1936
02:21:20,480 --> 02:21:23,500
Remember, you too were valued only
after you fit their norms of success.

1937
02:21:23,680 --> 02:21:26,500
Marks are all that matters today.
Nobody gives a damn about us.

1938
02:21:27,650 --> 02:21:29,780
I was studying well,
so they supported me.

1939
02:21:29,980 --> 02:21:31,830
Why didn't they help you
pursue civil services?

1940
02:21:32,270 --> 02:21:34,410
Isn't it selfish to support
only those who study well?

1941
02:21:34,440 --> 02:21:37,170
They supported me for
their own selfishness.

1942
02:21:37,200 --> 02:21:39,230
They had no intention
of helping me out.

1943
02:21:49,850 --> 02:21:51,070
What wrong did I do?

1944
02:21:51,090 --> 02:21:52,290
Remember your words?

1945
02:21:52,320 --> 02:21:56,330
Get educated and Money, Power,
Status and Reputation follows you.

1946
02:21:56,400 --> 02:21:57,880
And it followed me.

1947
02:21:58,500 --> 02:22:01,680
No book ever taught me to what
money to take and what not to.

1948
02:22:01,710 --> 02:22:03,430
No syllabus did.

1949
02:22:03,770 --> 02:22:06,670
Not just the books.
Even you didn't bother teaching me that!

1950
02:22:07,760 --> 02:22:11,190
If all you care about is your college's
reputation, then all I care about is mine.

1951
02:22:27,700 --> 02:22:30,390
All we can do now is target
this Examination building.

1952
02:22:30,410 --> 02:22:31,850
This is our last chance.

1953
02:22:32,600 --> 02:22:35,330
We now know who their
mole among us was.

1954
02:22:35,360 --> 02:22:37,710
They too know that their
cover has been exposed.

1955
02:22:38,770 --> 02:22:40,120
They now have only one option.

1956
02:22:40,170 --> 02:22:43,590
To disrupt our exam proceedings
and ruin our college's results.

1957
02:22:46,790 --> 02:22:48,510
Let the examinations begin.

1958
02:22:49,100 --> 02:22:50,970
We'll make sure it
doesn't end successfully.

1959
02:22:52,490 --> 02:22:53,560
Ramaiah...

1960
02:22:54,060 --> 02:22:56,110
If you doubt someone
when the exams are on.

1961
02:22:56,130 --> 02:22:57,300
Ring the bell!

1962
02:22:57,400 --> 02:22:59,790
Ring the bell once and I'll
know it's in the ground floor.

1963
02:22:59,810 --> 02:23:02,200
Ring the bell twice and I'll
know it's in the first floor.

1964
02:23:03,430 --> 02:23:05,750
I'll be there the very next
minute after you ring the bell.

1965
02:23:13,400 --> 02:23:15,700
Have the question
papers been segregated?

1966
02:23:15,720 --> 02:23:18,170
Are the Degree and Medical papers ready?
- Yes sir!

1967
02:23:56,150 --> 02:23:57,900
Show me your ID card.
Take it out!

1968
02:23:57,920 --> 02:24:00,910
Quick. You won't be able
to do your exams well!

1969
02:24:00,930 --> 02:24:02,580
Is this you?
- Yes sir. This is my ID.

1970
02:24:02,610 --> 02:24:05,280
What is your name?
What branch do you study in?

1971
02:24:05,310 --> 02:24:07,390
Please return my hall ticket!
- Give me the details!

1972
02:24:07,410 --> 02:24:09,450
Excuse me.
You're disturbing the students...

1973
02:24:09,470 --> 02:24:12,150
This is my duty. Who are you to ask me?
Show me your ID card!

1974
02:24:12,170 --> 02:24:13,570
Sir,
I'm a staff of this college...

1975
02:24:13,590 --> 02:24:15,670
Show me the damn ID card!
Don't talk too much!

1976
02:24:15,700 --> 02:24:18,650
Show me your ID card!
- Excuse me?

1977
02:24:20,040 --> 02:24:22,140
Please don't shout.
You're disturbing the students!

1978
02:24:22,170 --> 02:24:24,640
I'm from the Inspection Squad
from the board of Examination.

1979
02:24:24,660 --> 02:24:26,510
I have the authority
to check everyone.

1980
02:24:26,540 --> 02:24:29,000
I can check yours too.
Show me your ID card!

1981
02:24:29,030 --> 02:24:32,230
Show me your damn ID card!

1982
02:24:34,040 --> 02:24:35,850
Students!
Continue writing...

1983
02:24:49,620 --> 02:24:50,810
Yuvaraj!

1984
02:24:52,160 --> 02:24:53,420
What's happening here?

1985
02:24:54,320 --> 02:24:55,950
You're not supposed to do this!

1986
02:24:56,360 --> 02:24:58,990
Exams are on and he's
our squad member!

1987
02:24:59,880 --> 02:25:02,300
Sir, listen to me.
- Yuva...

1988
02:25:05,950 --> 02:25:08,090
He was misbehaving with
the lecturer in class!

1989
02:25:08,510 --> 02:25:10,000
He was disturbing
the students too.

1990
02:25:10,090 --> 02:25:12,390
He is clearly here
to disrupt the exams!

1991
02:25:12,620 --> 02:25:14,070
Show me the ID!

1992
02:25:20,250 --> 02:25:23,590
Along with him, more men have
come here as a part of the squad.

1993
02:25:24,550 --> 02:25:25,790
Yuvaraj!

1994
02:25:26,670 --> 02:25:28,920
If the exams are disrupted
and students face disturbance,

1995
02:25:28,940 --> 02:25:30,520
...it is a violation
of the board rules.

1996
02:25:30,610 --> 02:25:32,420
It might lead to a lockout again.

1997
02:25:32,440 --> 02:25:35,590
Sir, I'll make sure the
students don't get disturbed.

1998
02:25:35,690 --> 02:25:37,410
You make sure you
don't disturb me.

1999
02:25:37,810 --> 02:25:41,960
Let him be in this room.
I've no idea what the others are up to.

2000
02:25:41,980 --> 02:25:43,930
If I suspect someone,
I'll get them here.

[MOBILE PHONE RINGS]

2002
02:26:57,340 --> 02:26:59,630
I'll pretend to be on inspection.
Be ready.

2003
02:27:02,510 --> 02:27:05,850
Madam, I'll be on the first floor.
- Sure sir.

2004
02:27:25,240 --> 02:27:27,060
Does anybody want an
additional sheet...?

2005
02:27:38,070 --> 02:27:39,780
Is everything fine?
- It is sir.

2006
02:27:44,210 --> 02:27:46,430
Things are going fine, right?
- Everything is fine sir.

2007
02:27:59,260 --> 02:28:02,650
Are you relaxed thinking
the exams are going well?

2008
02:28:03,040 --> 02:28:07,710
Your college and your students will not
make it out of the labyrinth I've created.

2009
02:28:08,320 --> 02:28:12,280
By the time I go around this college
once, this college will be in ruins.

2010
02:28:21,770 --> 02:28:23,160
Gurudev, you are...!
- Shut up!

2011
02:28:23,180 --> 02:28:25,570
This isn't your cabinet or
your constituency to shout!

2012
02:28:25,600 --> 02:28:26,960
This is my college!

2013
02:28:27,060 --> 02:28:28,490
Silence!

2014
02:28:28,980 --> 02:28:31,000
You may misuse your power.

2015
02:28:31,020 --> 02:28:33,430
But there's another power here
that can't be messed with!

2016
02:28:34,190 --> 02:28:35,520
Protecting this college.

2017
02:28:53,890 --> 02:28:55,610
Let me go!
- Take your IDs out...

2018
02:28:55,640 --> 02:28:57,370
What are you looking at
morons? Show me...!

2019
02:29:03,360 --> 02:29:07,990
What could anyone do to me?
[POPULAR RAJKUMAR SONG]

2020
02:29:08,010 --> 02:29:13,150
What peril could anyone put me through?

2021
02:29:13,650 --> 02:29:17,040
Nothing can go wrong,
when Iâ€™m on the path of truth

2022
02:29:17,060 --> 02:29:20,040
When my principles
are protecting me

2023
02:29:20,060 --> 02:29:23,400
When this land has got my back

2024
02:29:23,430 --> 02:29:27,200
...and when Kannada is my soul.

2025
02:29:28,580 --> 02:29:31,590
The number you have
dialled is not reachable.

2026
02:29:37,090 --> 02:29:39,020
How are the exams going on?
- Going well sir.

2027
02:29:39,040 --> 02:29:40,510
Inform me if there's anything...

2028
02:30:00,250 --> 02:30:03,070
Sir! What's happening?
- There's half an hour more to go!

2029
02:30:03,810 --> 02:30:05,270
Sit down!

2030
02:30:05,290 --> 02:30:07,810
Ma'am, what's happening?
- Give me a minute. Let me check!

2031
02:30:07,830 --> 02:30:09,800
There's still time left!

2032
02:30:13,690 --> 02:30:15,120
Sir, I need the additional sheet.

2033
02:30:15,140 --> 02:30:18,300
Students, do not panic.
It's the wrong bell.

2034
02:30:18,320 --> 02:30:20,920
You still have thirty minutes left.
Quit panicking!

2035
02:30:20,950 --> 02:30:23,790
Return their papers to them!
- I will give them. Wait...

2036
02:30:24,040 --> 02:30:26,670
Sit down everyone.
- Students! It's a false alarm!

2037
02:30:26,700 --> 02:30:28,870
It's a false alarm!
You've got half an hour more.

2038
02:30:28,890 --> 02:30:30,540
Concentrate!
Sit down and write the exam!

2039
02:30:30,560 --> 02:30:31,730
Give them their papers!

2040
02:30:31,750 --> 02:30:34,300
It's a false alarm!

2041
02:30:34,320 --> 02:30:35,470
Ma'am, additional sheets?

2042
02:30:36,430 --> 02:30:39,020
Fear not students!
They're trying to distract us...

2043
02:30:39,040 --> 02:30:40,590
Sir, please give
us our papers back!

2044
02:30:40,620 --> 02:30:42,060
Sir, quickly give
them their papers!

2045
02:30:42,080 --> 02:30:44,100
Students, concentrate and write!

2046
02:32:13,510 --> 02:32:15,390
You will face the consequences!

2047
02:32:16,140 --> 02:32:19,620
You're arresting the Education
Minister without any evidence.

2048
02:32:49,560 --> 02:32:50,830
I'm proud of you my boy!

2049
02:32:58,660 --> 02:33:00,530
Thank you for helping
me with my IAS exams!

2050
02:33:00,550 --> 02:33:01,620
God bless you my boy!

2051
02:33:12,040 --> 02:33:13,320
Any hint of trouble. Inform me!

2052
02:33:37,110 --> 02:33:39,440
Not everyone can get
a Guru like you...

2053
02:33:41,850 --> 02:33:44,030
But you should never get
a student like me again!

2054
02:33:46,850 --> 02:33:48,180
Please forgive me, sir!

2055
02:34:13,020 --> 02:34:14,440
The examination results are out!

2056
02:34:18,550 --> 02:34:19,680
Sir...

2057
02:34:29,160 --> 02:34:30,260
Yuvaraj!

2058
02:34:37,870 --> 02:34:40,120
100% results!

2059
02:36:30,410 --> 02:36:33,560
I welcome you all to the Golden
Jubilee anniversary of R K University.

2060
02:36:34,290 --> 02:36:37,220
I'm here to confess
something to all of you.

2061
02:36:37,650 --> 02:36:41,590
Irrespective of whether you scored
well in your exams or did not do well,

2062
02:36:41,620 --> 02:36:45,290
...if ever I have
discriminated and hurt you

2063
02:36:46,840 --> 02:36:48,140
Please forgive me.

2064
02:36:49,970 --> 02:36:54,300
Education taught without values..
is futile.

2065
02:36:54,900 --> 02:36:56,660
No matter how brilliant
a student you are...

2066
02:36:57,340 --> 02:37:00,720
No matter how well-educated or
how many ever degrees you hold...

2067
02:37:01,080 --> 02:37:03,500
With no values in you,
you'll be corrupted.

2068
02:37:04,310 --> 02:37:06,570
You are of no use
to this society.

2069
02:37:07,380 --> 02:37:13,000
If education is delivered to students for
the sake of a degree, it's a business.

2070
02:37:14,020 --> 02:37:18,800
The very education when delivered to
students as knowledge, it's a service.

2071
02:37:19,470 --> 02:37:22,280
Education... is not a business.

2072
02:37:22,300 --> 02:37:24,500
It's a service! Thank you.
