1
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:48,895
Mine!

2
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:52,387
Whose pigeon?
My birds brought it down

3
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:57,831
You have no claim on it
- l am willing to pay

4
00:03:58,104 --> 00:03:58,968
8 annas

5
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:00,637
The price of six!

6
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,501
So go, buy three for 4 annas
- 4 rupees more likely

7
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:10,438
You made money giving
false testimony. Remember?

8
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:13,213
l never gave any false testimony

9
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:17,616
Wants pigeons?

10
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:24,428
He keeps pigeon only to
trouble you. He's a real scoundrel

11
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:28,129
lt was a bad day when you
testified against him

12
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:32,766
He's spent 12 years in prison.
He won't forget so easily

13
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:38,043
What made you testify
against him?

14
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:45,982
They asked me on oath
what kind of man he was

15
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,852
...so l told them

16
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:56,490
Bring us guavas and oranges
when you return - and a doll

17
00:04:58,398 --> 00:04:59,524
l will

18
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:03,869
Look at her, still playing with
dolls after her engagement

19
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,296
Come here

20
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:48,475
How are you, little sir?

21
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:53,943
You got engaged, and didn't
tell your Uncle Dilawar?

22
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:58,213
Come and get your pigeon.
Your father has paid for it

23
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,322
Wait here, l'll be
right back

24
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,896
This place looks all right

25
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:46,403
You'll kill her, but
what about my money

26
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:52,941
l thought you had other ideas
- l'll repay you

27
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:56,306
May l say something?
- Yes?

28
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:01,650
Let's go to Lucknow
and sell this girl

29
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,129
Amiran is missing

30
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:26,377
She was playing outside. Dilawar took
her away with an excuse about pigeons

31
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:31,208
For God's sake, go and find
my child

32
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:06,876
My child! Where's my child?

33
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:09,746
l've looked everywhere

34
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:33,003
Allah is great

35
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:35,337
Here, eat your food

36
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:42,739
Won't you eat?

37
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:46,478
What's your name?
- Ramdei. Yours?

38
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:51,782
Amiran. Did they kidnap you too?
- Yes, from that fair

39
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:01,595
So, there are the girls?
- Salaam

40
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:06,967
How much for this one?
- A thousand

41
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,372
Has your lover ever seen
that much money?

42
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:15,842
One thousand rupees!
Trying to con me!

43
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:17,410
Don't be offended

44
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:23,280
The way you talk! l've sent dozens
of girls to the palaces

45
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:25,956
Never paid more than 500

46
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:29,422
You name it then
- 200

47
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,157
Look at her face, her hands

48
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:36,401
Just 200, that's it

49
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,127
For 200, have this one

50
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:49,046
She's not bad either. A bit dark.
And a weak frame. 150 for her

51
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:52,714
Agreed

52
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:59,287
The Begum won't have
a dark girl

53
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:05,256
l'll take the first one.
Here, 200 rupees. Count them

54
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:06,823
Come, girl

55
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:37,523
''Who tied the swing
to the mango tree?''

56
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:46,101
''My lover swings...''

57
00:11:50,176 --> 00:12:06,013
''The swing tied to the
mango tree''

58
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:15,563
''He caught my arm, embraced me''

59
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:23,066
''Who tied the swing
to the mango tree?''

60
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:35,219
''Who tied the swing
to the mango tree?''

61
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:55,205
''My heart beats fast,
l'm scared''

62
00:12:55,541 --> 00:13:12,448
''Swing gently, my love''

63
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:42,982
Come

64
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,691
ls this the girl?

65
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,591
Come here, my child

66
00:13:56,235 --> 00:14:01,172
How much?
- Whatever it is, we go halves

67
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:06,068
Okay. The amount l promised is ready.
Where's the other girl?

68
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:09,642
A lady took her for her house

69
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:11,778
For how much?
- 400

70
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:16,113
l'd have given that
for a good-looking girl

71
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:18,583
This one's also good-looking

72
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,196
The money-box

73
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:57,922
Husseini, she's not expensive
at 250 rupees?

74
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,790
Expensive? She's cheap

75
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:06,838
Not so cheap either. Anyway, she
looks innocent enough

76
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:13,207
God knows where they lift them from.
They've no fear of God

77
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:18,941
l'm not responsible. The sin will be
on these rogues' heads

78
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:23,244
lf not here, they'd sell
somewhere

79
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:28,891
She's well-off here. You've heard
how the ladies treat their maids?

80
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:31,789
Of course. The other day ...

81
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:37,998
l heard that a lady who saw her maid
talking to her husband ...

82
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,372
had her killed with
red-hot irons

83
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,640
Such women will pay on the
Day of Judgment

84
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:49,277
Give me this girl,
l'll bring her up

85
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:53,006
She'll be yours but l'll care for her
- All right

86
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:56,112
Where're you from?
- Bangla

87
00:15:56,488 --> 00:16:01,653
You mean you don't know this?
Faizabad is also called Bangla

88
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:04,620
What's your name?
- Amiran

89
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,431
l'm Bismillah

90
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:10,595
l don't like that name.
l'll call you Umra

91
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:14,233
From now on you'll answer
to Umrao

92
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:18,099
When the lady says 'Umrao',
you say ''Yes 'm''

93
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,006
Come, have a bite

94
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,847
Yes'm

95
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:32,822
What does your father do?
- He's a caretaker

96
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:36,057
Where?
- At the tomb of Bahu Begum

97
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:38,427
Go to sleep

98
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:38,222
Will you see to her.

99
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,725
Come. What has happened to you?

100
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:45,154
l don't know what has happened
to her.

101
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:47,963
She was sleeping and she woke
up all of a sudden.

102
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:50,393
What are you trying to do?

103
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:52,694
You were trying to run away?
Where would you run to?

104
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:54,697
Run! Run!

105
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,734
She's just a child.

106
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:02,537
Thatis enough.

107
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,108
l will break your legs if you try to
run away again.

108
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:07,579
She won't.

109
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:10,917
What happened? Have you gone mad?

110
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:18,187
Where were you going? lf you had gone
out, someone would have killed you.

111
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:20,025
There are a lot of bandits out there.

112
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:23,529
Don't go anywhere again. This is
your home now.

113
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,452
Do your salaam

114
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:52,225
Khan Saheb will teach you
music. Will you learn?

115
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:57,427
He's a great musician. Put your heart
in it, and all Lucknow will know you

116
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:01,365
They'll all come to hear you sing.
You'll be known in the Court

117
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,204
Not to talk of the
money and jewels

118
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:07,345
You may begin, Khan Saheb

119
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:08,907
Hold out your right hand

120
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:16,154
We begin with the name of the
merciful Allah

121
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:20,922
Now sing with me

122
00:24:53,091 --> 00:25:09,531
Here mindlessness does not refer to
lack of intelligence or knowledge

123
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:22,183
This mindlessness is an ultimate bliss,
of love, when everything ceases

124
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:29,020
Neither the desire
nor its object remained

125
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:35,190
That is, neither the lover nor the
beloved remains, not even love itself

126
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:43,303
Only a state of mind which
the poet calls mindlessness

127
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:48,068
And this mindlessness is
the beauty of the couplet

128
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:55,479
Wonderful, sir, sometimes l too
feel like composing poetry

129
00:25:55,821 --> 00:26:01,123
Go ahead. There's no better way of
expressing one's feelings

130
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:06,193
Will you help with suggestions?
- But certainly!

131
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:20,608
Khanum is calling you
- Nothing wrong, l hope?

132
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:22,308
You'll have to ask her

133
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:35,615
Ma'am, did you call me?
- No. Who said l did?

134
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:37,154
Gohar Mirza

135
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:43,566
l haven't seen that rogue for two
days. l sent him to buy something

136
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,793
Must've spent the money!

137
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:48,367
Tell that rascal to see me

138
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:55,709
Gohar Mirza! This was an offering

139
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:58,215
Great!

140
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:01,982
Umrao, you make it better
than even Aunt Husseini

141
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,751
lt should be sweeter

142
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:07,157
You're shameless, telling lies
to get food

143
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,154
lt was meant for the shrine

144
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:12,689
Someone would've
eaten it anyway

145
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:19,335
l hope to God you die of
cholera. Die right now

146
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,302
Show me those
ornate earrings

147
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:03,738
Aren't they beautiful?

148
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:10,820
Where is the matching front piece?
- lt isn't ready yet

149
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:13,989
Send it today. We need it in two days
- Very well

150
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:20,326
Where is the banat from Delhi?
- lt's in the box

151
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:24,096
Are you saving it for
Maulvi Saheb's cap? Get it, quick

152
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:30,639
Khanum Saheba, your jokes
are priceless

153
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:34,136
My feet are killing me.
Do this, do that

154
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:37,176
Such a big gathering and only
me to do all the work

155
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:40,541
What are you doing here?

156
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:47,184
You'd forgotten about me. l was
very hungry, so l thought...

157
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,459
Couldn't you have waited
a little?

158
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:53,931
Why should you, l'm not your
lawful wedded wife

159
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,967
Stop being angry
at small things

160
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,098
Here, eat
- No

161
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:04,636
On your life, please sit

162
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:06,807
You're really good at
persuasion

163
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,151
Not only my heart, take...

164
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:17,685
Someone's there

165
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:33,403
Another poem? Great going,
Read

166
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:41,440
''Not only my heart, Sir,
take my life''

167
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:46,714
'' But do as l ask just once''

168
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:55,591
Not bad, but remember
two things

169
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:59,563
The delicacy of the thought...

170
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:03,526
And the rhythm of the words

171
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:12,169
Listen to the poet Mir...

172
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:18,812
''How do l describe the softness of
her lips? They are like rose petals''

173
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:24,253
You are talking
of great poets

174
00:30:25,256 --> 00:30:27,349
She is just a beginner

175
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:30,693
What do you say, sir?

176
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:39,262
You say, 'Not only my heart...'

177
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:44,641
You could say instead...

178
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:53,940
What is my heart? You take my life.
But do as l ask just once

179
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:28,583
''What is my heart?
You take my life''

180
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:44,427
''What is my heart?
You take my life''

181
00:31:45,904 --> 00:32:00,217
'' But do as l ask just once''

182
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:08,122
'' But do as l ask just once''

183
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:15,832
''What is my heart?
You take my life''

184
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:23,698
''You'll come here
again and again''

185
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:36,571
''Carefully observe this place''

186
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:43,616
''Carefully observe this place''

187
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:51,953
''What is my heart?
You should come to know.

188
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:37,738
''l know that friends
get estranged''

189
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:51,012
'' But why be obliged
to strangers?''

190
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:58,162
'' But why be obliged
to strangers?''

191
00:34:58,162 --> 00:35:05,125
''What is my heart?
You take my life''

192
00:35:38,269 --> 00:36:04,187
''lf you say, l'll bring
the sky down''

193
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:16,834
''Nothing is difficult
if you make up your mind''

194
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:24,039
''Nothing is difficult
if you make up your mind''

195
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:31,221
''What is my heart?
You take my life''

196
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:45,602
'' But do as l ask just once''

197
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:53,838
''Please accept...''

198
00:37:02,036 --> 00:37:04,527
Here
- You put it on me

199
00:37:11,546 --> 00:37:14,572
Like it?
- Very much

200
00:37:33,268 --> 00:37:39,867
Why look in the mirror?
Your image is in my eyes

201
00:37:43,044 --> 00:37:44,136
For me?

202
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:51,986
Let's see you put it on

203
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,921
You put it on me

204
00:38:33,027 --> 00:38:37,396
You bastard, you pick on my
girls to show your manhood

205
00:38:37,765 --> 00:38:39,357
l picked you from the gutter

206
00:38:39,634 --> 00:38:44,367
l gave you shelter, food,
clothes, money and...

207
00:38:44,606 --> 00:38:48,940
l swear, l never looked at anyone
before, Umrao herself called me

208
00:38:49,277 --> 00:38:53,543
Trying to fool me! Get out of here.
l don't want to see your face again

209
00:38:53,848 --> 00:38:58,547
lf you come here, l'll have your legs
broken. Now get out

210
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:05,122
Are you all right?
- Yes, by God's grace

211
00:39:08,663 --> 00:39:11,632
Come in, Nawab Saheb

212
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:24,643
Has Bismillah gone out?

213
00:39:25,513 --> 00:39:29,540
An admirer should be like you,
still asking after her

214
00:39:31,052 --> 00:39:32,280
Have some betel leaf

215
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:42,062
You know, Khanum, strange are
the ways of heart

216
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,964
You don't like
Malka or Bahar?

217
00:39:47,268 --> 00:39:48,667
Well, l...

218
00:39:49,237 --> 00:39:53,571
What do you think of Umrao?
What are you saying?

219
00:39:53,942 --> 00:39:56,536
She's at your service,
if you wish

220
00:39:57,111 --> 00:39:59,011
Do l take it as settled?

221
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:05,014
Sure. Just arrange for the money.
lt'll be at least 5,000

222
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:09,313
5000 !
- lt's a question

223
00:40:10,358 --> 00:40:12,553
lt'll take some time

224
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:15,853
Think about it. l have
several offers

225
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,857
l'll go to my estate

226
00:40:19,867 --> 00:40:32,769
ln every way l was done down. My
enemy's name written with my blood

227
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:11,710
What is this heart, you may take
my life. But do as l ask just once

228
00:41:15,189 --> 00:41:20,752
You'll come here
again and again

229
00:41:21,029 --> 00:41:24,226
Carefully observe this place.

230
00:41:32,874 --> 00:41:37,311
You're sure this is
your composition?

231
00:41:44,652 --> 00:41:47,519
lf my life be spared,
may l speak

232
00:41:48,122 --> 00:41:49,521
Yes?

233
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:56,860
The ghazal was written
by Umrao Jaan

234
00:41:58,566 --> 00:42:00,363
Umrao Jaan?
- Yes

235
00:42:01,369 --> 00:42:03,360
l've never heard this name before

236
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:13,171
Praising Umrao Jaan is like
holding a candle to the sun

237
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:20,110
She's so beautiful even the
Fairy Queen would envy her

238
00:42:21,389 --> 00:42:24,756
Her verses make great poets
admit defeat

239
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,687
And her voice!

240
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:35,258
Her voice is like a
leaping flame

241
00:43:00,728 --> 00:43:02,127
That's her.

242
00:43:35,696 --> 00:44:03,252
''Thousands are intoxicated
by these eyes''

243
00:44:03,591 --> 00:44:20,964
''Associated with these eyes
are a thousand tales''

244
00:44:21,442 --> 00:44:25,378
''The intoxication of these eyes...''

245
00:44:45,132 --> 00:45:07,079
''You are not the only one
disgraced for love of me''

246
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:24,999
''ln this city, there are
thousands like you''

247
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:38,175
''Thousands are intoxicated
by these eyes''

248
00:46:08,916 --> 00:46:33,196
''l'm the only one who
intoxicates with my eyes''

249
00:46:33,607 --> 00:46:50,889
''Though there thousands
of taverns in the world''

250
00:46:51,592 --> 00:47:04,562
''Thousands are intoxicated
by these eyes''

251
00:47:28,362 --> 00:47:49,979
''You think a gale can scare
such a flame''

252
00:47:50,351 --> 00:48:07,429
''A flame which is protected
by a thousand moths''

253
00:48:07,768 --> 00:48:16,267
''Thousands are intoxicated
by these eyes''

254
00:48:16,644 --> 00:48:29,614
''Associated with these eyes
are a thousand tales''

255
00:48:29,924 --> 00:48:34,418
''The intoxication of these eyes...''

256
00:49:10,302 --> 00:49:11,564
Twenty-five

257
00:49:13,438 --> 00:49:14,871
Look at Bismillah!

258
00:49:16,742 --> 00:49:18,039
25 again

259
00:49:18,944 --> 00:49:20,502
Watch the fun now

260
00:49:25,017 --> 00:49:26,507
Three!

261
00:49:31,156 --> 00:49:32,714
l keep losing. l won't play any more

262
00:49:39,097 --> 00:49:41,531
Spread the board, l'll play

263
00:49:47,806 --> 00:49:49,398
Has Khanum forgiven you?

264
00:49:49,741 --> 00:49:54,269
Of course. l'm the support
of her old age

265
00:49:58,083 --> 00:50:00,313
Are you angry with me?
- No

266
00:50:02,254 --> 00:50:05,246
Then give me your hand
- Why?

267
00:50:09,161 --> 00:50:11,356
Five mohurs of gold

268
00:50:12,865 --> 00:50:18,030
Advance for a performance?
- Nawab Sultan sent 10, l've kept 5

269
00:50:18,337 --> 00:50:20,965
Who is Nawab Sultan?

270
00:50:21,406 --> 00:50:23,931
The one who gave you
the necklace

271
00:50:27,246 --> 00:50:30,579
There's talk of his
retaining you

272
00:50:30,983 --> 00:50:33,850
And he's asked for the ghazal
which you sang yesterday

273
00:50:34,686 --> 00:50:37,621
l'll give it to him
when he comes here

274
00:50:38,824 --> 00:50:42,021
All right, give it to him

275
00:50:43,428 --> 00:50:48,730
lf you'd sent it through me, l'd
have earned some more gold

276
00:50:50,235 --> 00:50:53,830
Hide these
- Why? l have to give them to Khanum

277
00:50:54,306 --> 00:50:57,867
You don't have to tell her.
Neither will l

278
00:50:58,543 --> 00:50:59,771
l'll go and meet Khanum

279
00:51:48,994 --> 00:51:52,395
Please come in

280
00:52:21,994 --> 00:52:24,360
l rarely visit bordellos

281
00:52:25,330 --> 00:52:27,525
We are not such bad people

282
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,234
l've come because of you alone

283
00:52:33,472 --> 00:52:37,704
l know you're saying this
just to please me

284
00:52:38,477 --> 00:52:46,248
No. l haven't got over the
spell you cast that evening

285
00:52:46,651 --> 00:52:50,985
l felt as though you were
singing for me alone

286
00:52:51,289 --> 00:52:57,558
Whom else? Who else understood
music and poetry as well as you

287
00:53:00,032 --> 00:53:02,159
l was so lost in the music
that l forgot to applaud

288
00:53:04,236 --> 00:53:08,366
There can be no
greater applause than that

289
00:53:11,443 --> 00:53:17,848
The ghazal was written by you?
- lt's nothing, just doggerel

290
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:22,346
Such a beautiful poem;
don't call it doggerel

291
00:53:25,824 --> 00:53:28,258
You too write poetry

292
00:53:29,561 --> 00:53:35,864
Poetry is beyond one. Sometimes
when l am alone l may hum a tune

293
00:53:36,101 --> 00:53:39,332
We are alone here, hum something

294
00:53:39,671 --> 00:53:41,298
Before you l am dumb

295
00:53:42,307 --> 00:53:44,172
Oh, come on

296
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:49,780
On one condition
- l agree

297
00:53:50,816 --> 00:53:53,284
Give me a copy of that ghazal

298
00:53:53,785 --> 00:53:57,551
What a thing to ask for

299
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,594
Don't make me suffer,
let me hear it

300
00:54:09,034 --> 00:54:10,296
A few couplets

301
00:54:13,071 --> 00:54:19,943
''ln every way l was done down
My enemy's name written with my blood''

302
00:54:21,179 --> 00:54:25,741
''Why couldn't talk of her
make me happy today?''

303
00:54:26,251 --> 00:54:29,812
''Why couldn't talk of her
make me happy today?''

304
00:54:30,222 --> 00:54:33,350
''Why did her name make
my heart heavy today?''

305
00:54:33,625 --> 00:54:36,526
Wonderful!

306
00:54:41,133 --> 00:54:42,225
What's this?

307
00:54:43,635 --> 00:54:48,572
These couplets deserve
not one, but all of my poems

308
00:54:49,574 --> 00:54:52,270
You embarrass me

309
00:54:52,577 --> 00:54:59,073
l and my poetry are embarrassed
We're not worthy of you

310
00:55:00,819 --> 00:55:05,017
''Why couldn't talk of her
make me happy today?''

311
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:09,487
''Why did her name make
my heart heavy today?''

312
00:55:10,362 --> 00:55:13,695
What a beautiful thought

313
00:55:13,965 --> 00:55:17,401
l wrote it for a
poet's meeting in Faizabad

314
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:19,969
Faizabad?

315
00:55:20,906 --> 00:55:23,636
Yes, that's where my grandmother's
house is

316
00:55:23,975 --> 00:55:29,003
You come from Faizabad?
- Yes. Have you ever been there?

317
00:55:33,451 --> 00:55:37,888
Let it be. l don't remember
anything now

318
00:55:39,391 --> 00:55:41,882
lf you remember nothing, why are
your eyes moist?

319
00:55:44,429 --> 00:55:51,426
My eyes smert at times...
sometimes the light hurts them

320
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:59,274
lf l can be of any help...

321
00:56:01,012 --> 00:56:08,350
Nawab Saheb, don't take it so
seriously

322
00:56:08,887 --> 00:56:11,481
Have a betel leaf

323
00:56:28,206 --> 00:56:29,605
Look, Bismillah

324
00:56:31,243 --> 00:56:34,041
Aren't they nice?

325
00:56:38,049 --> 00:56:41,109
The gentleman sitting with Umrao...

326
00:56:41,453 --> 00:56:46,015
This is a bordello, all sorts of
people come here. Why?

327
00:56:46,491 --> 00:56:47,856
Please come this way

328
00:56:53,732 --> 00:56:56,462
My honor is in your hands now

329
00:56:57,702 --> 00:57:01,103
Sultan must not learn
that l come here

330
00:57:01,373 --> 00:57:06,470
Nawab Saheb? What are you saying?
What do you have to do with him?

331
00:57:06,845 --> 00:57:09,507
Sultan is my son

332
00:57:11,249 --> 00:57:14,980
His mother and l are separated,
but...

333
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:17,513
Rest assured, Nawab Saheb

334
00:57:19,557 --> 00:57:25,018
l'd brought this for Umrao,
you keep it now

335
00:57:30,802 --> 00:57:36,502
ln just a month you've driven me
mad, l can't rest without seeing you

336
00:57:40,512 --> 00:57:42,070
What can l say?

337
00:57:46,017 --> 00:57:46,915
Why?

338
00:57:50,522 --> 00:57:58,452
Now you're here l remember nothing.
But there was something l had to say

339
00:58:01,533 --> 00:58:03,660
l know what you had to say

340
00:58:35,433 --> 00:58:41,497
Me, You, And this solitude

341
00:58:45,377 --> 00:58:49,780
Listen, l've composed a tune for you
- Not now.

342
00:58:51,449 --> 00:58:52,916
Do listen

343
00:58:54,586 --> 00:59:01,651
l'm listening. Hair like
rain clouds, eyes like doe's...

344
00:59:03,194 --> 00:59:08,928
... lips like rose petals,
neck like an amphora

345
00:59:10,101 --> 00:59:11,591
This is your poem

346
00:59:12,036 --> 00:59:16,200
l won't talk to you.
Are my poems that bad?

347
00:59:16,808 --> 00:59:19,800
All right, don't be angry.
l'll listen

348
00:59:31,956 --> 00:59:37,394
Go ahead, sing, why did you stop?
l'm no outsider

349
00:59:37,662 --> 00:59:40,460
Who are you?
- l've come to hear you sing

350
00:59:41,966 --> 00:59:43,297
Sing

351
00:59:44,169 --> 00:59:45,568
What's the matter, Umrao?

352
00:59:46,938 --> 00:59:50,806
Khan Saheb, please step this way
- Why?

353
00:59:51,109 --> 00:59:53,907
l've something to say
- Say it from there

354
00:59:54,712 --> 00:59:59,149
l'm not getting up from here
- You force yourself on us?

355
00:59:59,417 --> 01:00:02,682
Who's forcing anybody?
A bordello is open to all

356
01:00:03,188 --> 01:00:06,248
No bastard has any
special rights

357
01:00:06,491 --> 01:00:09,688
Whoever produces cash
gets the girl

358
01:00:09,961 --> 01:00:12,327
l'm ready to spend

359
01:00:12,697 --> 01:00:15,291
Visit us some other time

360
01:00:15,567 --> 01:00:20,800
Shut up, woman. l've told you
l'm not leaving this place

361
01:00:21,139 --> 01:00:23,300
Child, you come here

362
01:00:26,911 --> 01:00:28,242
Please let go her hand

363
01:00:29,681 --> 01:00:34,414
No pimp dare make me let go

364
01:00:34,686 --> 01:00:38,349
Mind your tongue; perhaps you
don't know how decent folk behave

365
01:00:41,326 --> 01:00:47,356
You've been with a lot of
decent folk. Do what you can

366
01:00:47,665 --> 01:00:52,125
But for the honor of my family,
l'd have taught you a lesson

367
01:00:52,604 --> 01:00:56,472
You visit whores, and you're
afraid of mother?

368
01:00:57,175 --> 01:00:58,335
Call Macca Pasi

369
01:01:00,845 --> 01:01:05,714
Don't rely on servants
See this sword?

370
01:01:05,917 --> 01:01:10,445
This is not a fence-ring. lf you
want a fight, come outside

371
01:01:11,389 --> 01:01:16,292
Little boy, you're still
kissable

372
01:01:16,628 --> 01:01:21,725
lf you fight with a grown man,
you'll cop it and make mother cry

373
01:01:34,712 --> 01:01:36,703
Go home, sir. l'll manage
things

374
01:01:37,649 --> 01:01:42,177
l won't go
- You'll get a bad name. Go home

375
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:45,848
Go, or you'll get into
a murder case

376
01:01:46,124 --> 01:01:47,113
l said l won't go

377
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:52,189
He's still alive
- Such bastards don't die easily

378
01:01:52,530 --> 01:01:54,430
l implore you. Go away
from here

379
01:02:04,809 --> 01:02:09,439
Pick him up and throw him
in the gutter. We'll see later

380
01:02:29,434 --> 01:02:35,532
She sits in mourning
with her hair open ...

381
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:40,436
My desires joined in the condolence

382
01:02:40,778 --> 01:02:45,647
Don't tease the girl. She's not well

383
01:02:46,017 --> 01:02:50,613
She's not ill, just pining away for
Nawab Sultan

384
01:02:51,222 --> 01:02:54,316
And he's hiding his head
in mother's lap

385
01:02:54,659 --> 01:02:58,720
l know, there's no true love
these days

386
01:03:00,031 --> 01:03:04,468
God help me, but in our days
there were lovers

387
01:03:05,036 --> 01:03:09,370
Either you possess someone
or you make someone yours

388
01:03:10,441 --> 01:03:16,380
Take our Maulvi Saheb.
He'd come to show me his nuptial suit

389
01:03:16,714 --> 01:03:22,812
l took his hand and made him sit
down. 40 years later, he's still here

390
01:03:25,556 --> 01:03:28,457
lf you wish l can get hold
of a lover of those days...

391
01:03:30,261 --> 01:03:36,791
Bald, toothless, but
he's lord of 40 villages

392
01:03:37,335 --> 01:03:39,394
Name - Nawab Jafar

393
01:03:40,672 --> 01:03:43,470
Take a note
- To whom? Nawab Jafar?

394
01:03:44,409 --> 01:03:45,637
No - him

395
01:03:54,585 --> 01:03:58,578
''To love me or not is in your power''

396
01:03:59,023 --> 01:04:03,756
'' But for me not to love you
is beyond my power''

397
01:04:09,267 --> 01:04:10,791
Please take this reply

398
01:04:24,415 --> 01:04:28,511
Your letter has rekindled
the fire that was buried

399
01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:33,855
l'm held to my word. l'll never
come to your house again

400
01:04:35,359 --> 01:04:38,760
My friend Banna Saheb
lives in Nawabganj

401
01:04:39,030 --> 01:04:41,726
Come there this evening
if you have time

402
01:07:04,709 --> 01:07:08,372
The Nawab will be a bit late.
The lady is calling you

403
01:07:08,579 --> 01:07:10,740
Who, Banna Saheb's wife?

404
01:07:11,082 --> 01:07:12,049
Yes'm

405
01:07:28,499 --> 01:07:33,027
My husband has been at Nawab
Sultan's place since morning

406
01:07:35,973 --> 01:07:39,875
l think his mother
is not well

407
01:07:40,511 --> 01:07:42,411
Ma'am, who's this?

408
01:07:43,047 --> 01:07:46,676
What's it to you?
As if l don't know

409
01:07:46,984 --> 01:07:51,421
Everyone knows her
- so why do you ask?

410
01:07:51,722 --> 01:07:58,321
Who's talking to you?
l was asking our lady

411
01:07:58,663 --> 01:08:04,533
How can l dare to talk
to you, you're high society

412
01:08:05,269 --> 01:08:10,002
lf you want to show your
coarseness, go to the elder Begum

413
01:08:10,374 --> 01:08:16,438
Yes, you're right, with her here
l'm not needed

414
01:08:16,647 --> 01:08:22,586
Will you go before l hit you?
- Let her go, she's just silly

415
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:27,757
You shut up, you whore
or l'll strangle you

416
01:08:28,025 --> 01:08:30,926
Mean, low-born...

417
01:08:31,195 --> 01:08:34,631
Let her go, she's old

418
01:08:34,932 --> 01:08:36,797
What's up?

419
01:08:37,268 --> 01:08:41,432
This whore made me get a beating
- You dare again!

420
01:08:41,706 --> 01:08:43,833
Why did you pick on her?

421
01:08:44,141 --> 01:08:48,441
l swear l said nothing. Seems she's
got up on the wrong side of the bed

422
01:08:48,746 --> 01:08:50,907
Such rude things she said

423
01:08:51,349 --> 01:08:58,778
You gave her beating for nothing,
child, for this loose woman

424
01:08:59,290 --> 01:09:04,455
That's why l was saying
one can't trust whores

425
01:09:04,729 --> 01:09:07,163
Even their shadows
should be avoided

426
01:09:14,839 --> 01:09:17,307
lf you want to meet me,
come to our house

427
01:09:19,643 --> 01:09:21,838
You know l can't go there

428
01:09:24,548 --> 01:09:26,379
And l can't come here

429
01:09:41,298 --> 01:09:47,498
Come in, Panna Mal. You went for
two days and stayed away for 15

430
01:09:47,805 --> 01:09:49,864
Haven't you heard?
- What?

431
01:09:50,274 --> 01:09:56,679
l'm ruined. My house was burgled.
l've lost the wealth of generations

432
01:09:56,914 --> 01:09:58,176
How much is the loss?

433
01:09:58,449 --> 01:10:03,148
There is nothing left. The jewellery
is worth 200,000

434
01:10:03,454 --> 01:10:11,054
ls my jewellery gone?
- Mercifully, no. lt was in the shop

435
01:10:11,362 --> 01:10:17,164
Thank God. So many burglaries
in the city these days

436
01:10:18,469 --> 01:10:24,032
Yours is the third one
in a row

437
01:10:25,009 --> 01:10:27,273
The police chief doesn't know
what to do

438
01:10:27,611 --> 01:10:34,016
Known thieves of the city were
questioned. They deny any hand in it

439
01:10:34,285 --> 01:10:38,984
l hear its an outsider,
an outlaw named Faiz Ali

440
01:10:39,457 --> 01:10:41,687
There's a lady come to
meet you...

441
01:10:43,961 --> 01:10:45,724
Show her in

442
01:10:46,464 --> 01:10:47,897
The curtains

443
01:10:48,365 --> 01:10:51,459
Girls, take him to your rooms

444
01:10:51,836 --> 01:10:55,966
Me, with them, to their rooms...
What luck!

445
01:11:08,018 --> 01:11:09,383
Where are you from?

446
01:11:12,756 --> 01:11:14,155
l hope there's no one else here

447
01:11:14,492 --> 01:11:17,393
No one. Just you,
me and them...

448
01:11:17,928 --> 01:11:21,887
l'm Fakhrunnisa
- Chabban's mother

449
01:11:22,266 --> 01:11:25,997
You are Bismillah's mother?
- Yes. Go on, please

450
01:11:26,270 --> 01:11:31,037
Chabban is my only son,
brought up with great love

451
01:11:31,408 --> 01:11:40,510
He's engaged to his cousin,
but he refuses to marry her

452
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:47,142
His uncle has disinherited
him because of it

453
01:11:47,416 --> 01:11:53,377
Do me a favor. Get Chabban
to agree to this marriage

454
01:11:53,789 --> 01:12:00,661
Your daughter has a home for life.
l'll give more than Chabban paid her

455
01:12:00,997 --> 01:12:04,990
Save my home from
being wrecked

456
01:12:07,036 --> 01:12:11,973
l'm your slave. God willing,
it will be as you say

457
01:12:12,241 --> 01:12:14,641
But Chabban must not
know of this

458
01:12:16,779 --> 01:12:20,442
There was no need for this.
We are your servants

459
01:12:20,816 --> 01:12:24,479
Now l'll ask for your leave
- God be with you

460
01:12:27,557 --> 01:12:31,823
How are you?
- Well, by God's grace

461
01:12:32,094 --> 01:12:34,528
We pray for your well being

462
01:12:34,830 --> 01:12:39,927
No matter how well we do, we still
look to you for support

463
01:12:41,337 --> 01:12:46,969
This time l have a request,
lf you permit...

464
01:12:47,276 --> 01:12:48,368
Command me

465
01:12:56,352 --> 01:13:00,721
They brought this shawl for
sale. The trader wants 2,000

466
01:13:01,190 --> 01:13:05,183
l think it's not
too expensive at 1700 or 1800

467
01:13:05,661 --> 01:13:11,691
lf you are generous, l'll wear
a shawl in my old age

468
01:13:14,036 --> 01:13:15,867
You keep out of this

469
01:13:16,205 --> 01:13:20,608
You ask him for so many
things. Let me ask today

470
01:13:20,943 --> 01:13:27,872
Nawab Saheb, has the cat caught
your tongue? Say something

471
01:13:28,184 --> 01:13:30,675
lf not yes, at least say no

472
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:35,316
This shawl is of
no consequence

473
01:13:35,725 --> 01:13:39,286
Perhaps you are unaware
of my condition

474
01:13:39,629 --> 01:13:41,494
Nothing wrong, l hope

475
01:13:41,764 --> 01:13:45,291
l'll no longer accede
to your requests

476
01:13:45,801 --> 01:13:52,172
We're so low that rich men like you
are miserly about little things

477
01:13:52,375 --> 01:13:53,967
lt's the truth

478
01:13:56,979 --> 01:14:01,814
lf you can't any longer,
why visit us?

479
01:14:02,151 --> 01:14:06,850
You know very well that a
courtesan is a rich man's friend

480
01:14:07,156 --> 01:14:08,953
Courtesy won't fill our bellies

481
01:14:09,325 --> 01:14:17,164
This is your home, come when
you please. But think of your honor

482
01:14:19,068 --> 01:14:24,335
l've really made a mistake
l'll never come again

483
01:14:24,774 --> 01:14:28,437
You're angry. l won't
let you go

484
01:14:29,011 --> 01:14:32,811
Want me to be insulted again
by your mother?

485
01:14:59,008 --> 01:15:05,106
''The eyes have raised so many storms.
The boat of memories doesn't sink''

486
01:15:05,414 --> 01:15:10,044
''l see no way of meeting you,
getting you again''

487
01:15:10,519 --> 01:15:15,422
What are you writing? A love-letter
to Nawab Sultan?

488
01:15:15,725 --> 01:15:17,488
Can't l write anything else?

489
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:23,492
You can't even think of it.
You're dedicated to Sultan

490
01:15:23,899 --> 01:15:29,269
l'm afraid you'll go
to his house one day

491
01:15:29,805 --> 01:15:34,833
You seem chirpy. You've got
over grieving for Chabban

492
01:15:35,211 --> 01:15:42,174
Don't talk of him. Whenever
he is mentioned, l hate the world

493
01:15:42,785 --> 01:15:48,553
Especially Mother
- What has she done?

494
01:15:48,858 --> 01:15:52,954
She's responsible
for Chabban's death

495
01:15:53,295 --> 01:15:57,595
lf she hadn't taunted him,
he wouldn't have died

496
01:15:57,900 --> 01:16:00,892
Bismillah, you're
completely changed

497
01:16:01,237 --> 01:16:05,264
You used to say a whore is
respected only in her house

498
01:16:05,608 --> 01:16:08,839
Outside, she's nothing. And now -

499
01:16:09,011 --> 01:16:12,811
After Chabban l don't like anything

500
01:16:13,182 --> 01:16:18,848
l feel, if l find someone, l'll
just hold his hand for ever

501
01:16:19,121 --> 01:16:24,821
You're a strange one. And you
object to my ways!

502
01:16:25,094 --> 01:16:30,122
Don't compare Sultan with Chabban

503
01:16:30,533 --> 01:16:37,462
Chabban could give up his life.
Sultan doesn't even dare meet you

504
01:16:37,907 --> 01:16:41,741
He wants to. l don't let him

505
01:16:42,077 --> 01:16:46,810
That's what you say. l'll ask
you when he betrays you

506
01:16:56,025 --> 01:17:02,430
For your sake, l've worn out
both my feet and tongue

507
01:17:02,698 --> 01:17:04,063
Oh God! What have l done?

508
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:12,908
Not you, me. My feet ache from
making trips to Sultans house

509
01:17:13,209 --> 01:17:16,372
He was tending, his sick mother

510
01:17:16,979 --> 01:17:25,478
When l finally met him, my tongue
wore out talking of your passion

511
01:17:29,358 --> 01:17:34,386
''What has this heart not done
for love of you''

512
01:17:34,663 --> 01:17:35,994
What did he say?

513
01:17:36,365 --> 01:17:38,663
What could he say?

514
01:17:39,034 --> 01:17:46,440
''Mention of that green fairy...
And then my description''

515
01:17:46,775 --> 01:17:53,010
He started begging ''Arrange
a meeting with Umrao, somehow''

516
01:17:53,515 --> 01:17:56,177
l'll never meet him
at Banne Saheb's

517
01:17:56,518 --> 01:17:58,509
He'll come to meet you in Musabagh

518
01:17:58,821 --> 01:18:04,282
Musabagh? But that's outside town.
Khanum won't let me go that far

519
01:18:05,794 --> 01:18:13,223
For just five rupees
l'll arrange everything

520
01:18:13,435 --> 01:18:14,959
l'll give it. Tell me

521
01:18:15,304 --> 01:18:16,828
Khanum herself will take you

522
01:18:18,274 --> 01:18:20,504
Wait and see

523
01:18:43,799 --> 01:18:45,130
The saffron?

524
01:18:45,401 --> 01:18:49,599
Oh God, l forgot!
- What do we put in the 'pulao' then?

525
01:18:49,872 --> 01:18:56,402
lt's because of him. His betel leaf,
his tobacco, his hookah...

526
01:18:57,246 --> 01:19:00,841
The carriage is waiting. l'll get it
- Forget it, you'll be gone all day

527
01:19:01,450 --> 01:19:06,444
Looks as if he's never eaten.
Get out of there

528
01:19:08,290 --> 01:19:10,815
Hurry up
- lt's ready

529
01:19:44,226 --> 01:19:51,997
l haven't seen you all these days.
l kept worrying; thinking

530
01:20:13,188 --> 01:20:26,898
''Whenever life brings me
to your side''

531
01:20:28,704 --> 01:20:38,909
''Whenever life brings me
to your side''

532
01:20:39,281 --> 01:20:49,122
''... the earth seems fairer
than the moon''

533
01:20:49,591 --> 01:20:59,193
''... the earth seems fairer
than the moon''

534
01:21:17,119 --> 01:21:27,154
''The fragrance of flowers
fills my heart''

535
01:21:29,898 --> 01:21:39,739
''The fragrance of flowers
fills my heart''

536
01:21:40,175 --> 01:21:49,948
''When evening comes,
your voice calls me''

537
01:21:50,619 --> 01:21:59,789
''When evening comes,
your voice calls me''

538
01:22:00,295 --> 01:22:10,034
''... the earth seems fairer
than the moon''

539
01:22:27,756 --> 01:22:37,495
''Your thought like a whisper''

540
01:22:40,035 --> 01:22:49,774
''Your thought like a whisper''

541
01:22:50,412 --> 01:22:59,878
''Wakes me up in the
darkest hours''

542
01:23:00,289 --> 01:23:09,721
''Wakes me up in the
darkest hours''

543
01:23:10,299 --> 01:23:19,765
''... the earth seems fairer
than the moon''

544
01:23:35,290 --> 01:23:44,790
''Why must every meeting end
in separation ?''

545
01:23:47,569 --> 01:23:59,208
''Why must every meeting end
in separation ?''

546
01:23:59,881 --> 01:24:09,415
''This thought torments me
all the time now''

547
01:24:09,992 --> 01:24:19,196
''This thought torments me
all the time now''

548
01:24:19,701 --> 01:24:28,871
''... the earth seems fairer
than the moon''

549
01:24:29,311 --> 01:24:40,313
''Whenever life brings me
to your side...''

550
01:25:10,584 --> 01:25:14,748
Umrao is crazy about Sultan

551
01:25:16,557 --> 01:25:18,548
And l have no one

552
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:23,761
So you want to talk of love?

553
01:25:25,266 --> 01:25:27,666
What else when we're alone?

554
01:25:29,136 --> 01:25:30,626
So that's it

555
01:25:50,224 --> 01:25:52,385
Dacoits have carried away
Bismillah

556
01:26:28,229 --> 01:26:32,996
lf we'd found her corpse we could
have wept and comforted ourselves

557
01:26:40,007 --> 01:26:43,943
The Nawab Saheb is waiting outside
What ! He's come here

558
01:26:44,345 --> 01:26:46,108
Help me

559
01:26:52,219 --> 01:27:01,150
l've come here because
my niece has come of age

560
01:27:02,396 --> 01:27:10,565
You know she has been engaged
to Sultan since childhood

561
01:27:12,740 --> 01:27:17,837
l'd like to be
as soon as -

562
01:27:18,112 --> 01:27:26,076
But l informed you that
l do not accept this match

563
01:27:26,420 --> 01:27:30,550
lt was fixed before
you and l divorced

564
01:27:31,392 --> 01:27:37,297
God knows the trouble
you've caused me

565
01:27:37,932 --> 01:27:43,564
l'm surprised that you called
on me after these 15 years

566
01:27:43,871 --> 01:27:46,704
At least ask Sultan if -

567
01:27:46,907 --> 01:27:52,436
Ask Sultan ? Who knows
better than me? What's good for him?

568
01:27:53,114 --> 01:27:56,379
The trouble l've gone through
to give him a good upbringing

569
01:27:56,650 --> 01:27:59,084
And l didn't take a penny
from you for his upkeep

570
01:27:59,353 --> 01:28:03,881
But l want this match for Sultan's
own good

571
01:28:04,291 --> 01:28:14,531
Perhaps you don't know
that Sultan is going astray

572
01:28:15,035 --> 01:28:18,596
He visits courtesans

573
01:28:18,873 --> 01:28:23,572
How dare you malign my child! Since
when have you worried about his good

574
01:28:23,944 --> 01:28:29,610
Where were you till now ? Say rather
that you want a match for your niece

575
01:28:30,017 --> 01:28:32,349
Look at yourself

576
01:28:34,555 --> 01:28:38,719
You wrecked our home for that
wretched Khanum

577
01:28:40,227 --> 01:28:42,923
And even now you keep
visiting her

578
01:28:44,398 --> 01:28:49,665
Visiting courtesans is
an aristocratic tradition

579
01:28:49,937 --> 01:28:55,466
A tradition for the father, yes.
For the son, its going 'astray'

580
01:28:55,743 --> 01:28:57,438
Great !

581
01:28:57,778 --> 01:29:01,771
l'd rather he visit courtesans than
marry your niece

582
01:29:04,084 --> 01:29:06,746
lt's no use arguing with you

583
01:29:08,422 --> 01:29:14,019
Sultan is my only son. l will
decide about his marriage

584
01:29:15,262 --> 01:29:19,358
l'll fix a date, let's see
what you can do about it

585
01:29:19,700 --> 01:29:26,663
l know my son won't hurt me.
He won't take a step against my wishes

586
01:29:27,508 --> 01:29:32,536
Don't trouble me, in my condition.
For God's sake, go away

587
01:29:42,623 --> 01:29:48,493
lf l could find a nice girl l'd fix
Sultans marriage at once

588
01:29:48,762 --> 01:29:53,131
Then we'd see what the Nawab could do.
He couldn't do a thing

589
01:29:53,467 --> 01:29:56,800
Sultan won't marry
against my wishes

590
01:30:10,684 --> 01:30:14,017
My child, come
and sit near me

591
01:30:31,572 --> 01:30:32,937
You're very late

592
01:30:33,841 --> 01:30:38,437
Ever since Bismillah went,
Khanum doesn't let me come out alone

593
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:40,713
lt was difficult to get away

594
01:30:43,784 --> 01:30:45,775
You seem troubled

595
01:30:55,696 --> 01:30:59,860
Perhaps l'm not worthy
of being told your troubles

596
01:31:01,835 --> 01:31:04,702
My troubles can't be
put into words

597
01:31:05,639 --> 01:31:08,836
Say something. lt'll lighten
your heart

598
01:31:11,445 --> 01:31:13,242
What can l say...

599
01:31:15,249 --> 01:31:22,155
l can't understand you even now.
Sometimes l feel nothing separates us

600
01:31:23,123 --> 01:31:29,119
At other times it seems your
inner world is hidden from me

601
01:31:30,030 --> 01:31:34,831
Why think so ? l've never
considered you an outsider

602
01:31:36,937 --> 01:31:38,768
Then why hide things
from me?

603
01:31:42,209 --> 01:31:47,408
Father never met us. Now suddenly
he wants me to marry his niece

604
01:31:47,748 --> 01:31:49,045
Why don't you ?

605
01:31:51,852 --> 01:31:53,877
For your sake l'll bear
even that

606
01:31:55,155 --> 01:32:01,219
Mother is dead against it. She wants
me to have nothing to do with them

607
01:32:02,129 --> 01:32:03,790
l don't know what to do

608
01:32:05,933 --> 01:32:11,667
Do whatever your mother says.
Her claim on you is greater

609
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:15,800
You have my best wishes anyway

610
01:32:17,811 --> 01:32:21,042
Mother may not like that, either

611
01:32:45,139 --> 01:32:46,436
Listen

612
01:32:59,486 --> 01:33:36,623
You sing well
- Who are you?

613
01:33:38,358 --> 01:33:43,489
He wants to meet you.
- He has talked to Khanum

614
01:34:09,490 --> 01:34:13,950
l saw you some months back,
in passing

615
01:34:15,762 --> 01:34:20,961
Once l thought of coming here
but somehow l didn't

616
01:34:22,870 --> 01:34:28,001
And then the house was closed
for ''Mohurrum''

617
01:34:28,575 --> 01:34:31,738
l too went home
on some work

618
01:34:34,014 --> 01:34:36,175
l kept thinking of you

619
01:34:38,318 --> 01:34:44,780
Wondering what you were like,
how your voice would sound

620
01:34:46,426 --> 01:34:50,453
Thinking of something ?
- No

621
01:34:51,064 --> 01:34:54,397
All right, you needn't
tell me

622
01:34:57,738 --> 01:35:02,038
Here - a gift

623
01:35:10,217 --> 01:35:11,582
Keep it

624
01:35:19,192 --> 01:35:22,684
But this is a diamond !
ls it for me ?

625
01:35:23,330 --> 01:35:24,524
Don't you like it ?

626
01:35:25,799 --> 01:35:31,635
l like it, but ... does he love
you very much ?

627
01:35:34,741 --> 01:35:40,145
Who can have faith in such love?
- lt's faith that turns into love

628
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:45,213
Look at me. Faith in Husseini has
kept me here all my life

629
01:35:46,053 --> 01:35:47,714
You're different

630
01:35:48,288 --> 01:35:51,587
No, my child, it's the
same thing

631
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:57,988
Either make someone your own
or belong to someone

632
01:36:03,804 --> 01:36:05,271
l tried

633
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:07,998
Try again

634
01:36:09,576 --> 01:36:15,412
You don't belong in a bordello.
The whole world is yours

635
01:36:43,110 --> 01:36:44,099
Do you drink ?

636
01:36:45,646 --> 01:36:47,978
No, sir

637
01:36:54,154 --> 01:37:00,286
Okay. l'm going to my village
for some days

638
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:02,687
Where ?
- Farrukhabad

639
01:37:07,668 --> 01:37:08,760
Want to come with me ?

640
01:37:10,103 --> 01:37:12,970
Khanum will not let me
out of Lucknow with anyone

641
01:37:13,540 --> 01:37:17,135
l'm not just anyone.
l am a landlord

642
01:37:17,778 --> 01:37:21,009
l'll give 2 months salary
as advance

643
01:37:21,948 --> 01:37:24,212
l'll ask Khanum, Nawab Saheb

644
01:37:26,253 --> 01:37:32,590
Nawab Saheb ! Who, me?

645
01:37:32,859 --> 01:37:34,486
What else should l call you?

646
01:37:39,666 --> 01:37:42,794
Call me Nawab Saheb.
l like it

647
01:38:22,843 --> 01:38:27,610
l've come to invite you.
l'm getting married tomorrow

648
01:38:28,515 --> 01:38:32,975
God bless you.
May the bride prosper

649
01:38:34,287 --> 01:38:36,084
How nice these clothes look!

650
01:39:15,462 --> 01:39:17,589
Ah, the lovers of these days!

651
01:39:19,766 --> 01:39:24,863
l too tore someone's
wedding clothes, but you see

652
01:39:34,281 --> 01:39:35,407
Who was this boy?

653
01:39:38,852 --> 01:39:42,117
lf you like, l'll get him here,
bound hand and foot

654
01:39:44,958 --> 01:39:50,919
Why weep for him?
They're all like this

655
01:39:51,965 --> 01:39:56,402
They swagger about in the square
but a little mouse scares them

656
01:39:59,339 --> 01:40:02,604
The English have made
our stupid King useless

657
01:40:06,413 --> 01:40:09,507
These nobles are immersed
in luxury

658
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:17,149
l tell you, soon the English
will come in

659
01:40:18,058 --> 01:40:21,152
Then all their aristocracy
will vanish

660
01:40:23,129 --> 01:40:24,619
What's wrong ?

661
01:40:26,433 --> 01:40:29,459
My head aches
- Should l massage it ?

662
01:40:33,874 --> 01:40:39,540
Come with me. With the fresh air
you'll never get a headache

663
01:40:41,481 --> 01:40:45,645
l can't take you away
against your wish

664
01:40:46,553 --> 01:40:48,020
lf it had been
any other woman ...

665
01:40:49,956 --> 01:40:51,981
Don't know who he thinks
he is

666
01:40:52,525 --> 01:40:56,017
''months ? Don't agree, even
if he offers 2 years salary''

667
01:40:56,863 --> 01:41:01,800
Look at his face! Thinks
every woman is his concubine

668
01:41:02,302 --> 01:41:08,969
When he comes next, throw Rs.150
in his face and tell me to get lost

669
01:41:09,342 --> 01:41:13,642
That day he called me
an old woman

670
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:15,377
Here's 500 rupees

671
01:41:15,782 --> 01:41:19,548
An advance for a recital
by Umrao from the Rao of Sitapur

672
01:41:21,521 --> 01:41:26,424
l won't go. Return the money
- Khanum never does that

673
01:41:26,893 --> 01:41:31,592
l have a headache
- You'll be all right by evening

674
01:41:32,399 --> 01:41:34,230
When is the recital ?
- Tomorrow

675
01:41:34,567 --> 01:41:36,831
l won't go to Sitapur

676
01:41:38,004 --> 01:41:41,269
Don't talk that way.
Khanum will take offence

677
01:41:41,608 --> 01:41:44,372
You care only
for the dance

678
01:41:44,577 --> 01:41:46,067
You too get something from it

679
01:41:46,579 --> 01:41:49,707
For God's sake,
don't bother me

680
01:41:50,083 --> 01:41:54,383
What's wrong with you? You
didn't even want to meet that man

681
01:41:54,788 --> 01:41:57,723
Then you're ready to go
with him to Farrukhabad

682
01:41:58,325 --> 01:42:02,159
We stopped you, so you don't want
to dance... your head aches

683
01:42:02,495 --> 01:42:05,020
You're forcing me
- Who's forcing anymore?

684
01:42:05,332 --> 01:42:09,428
lf a lion loves a lamb,
he starves. You must dance.

685
01:42:23,550 --> 01:42:24,983
l'll go with you

686
01:42:28,788 --> 01:42:30,278
You will?

687
01:42:30,657 --> 01:42:36,152
Yes, whether they let me or not,
l'll certainly go

688
01:42:36,830 --> 01:42:38,092
Secretly?

689
01:42:38,698 --> 01:42:43,294
Whichever way, take me away.
This place is stifling me

690
01:42:53,380 --> 01:42:57,146
ls your headache better?
- Yes. How far is Kanpur?

691
01:42:57,884 --> 01:42:58,873
Tired ?

692
01:42:59,686 --> 01:43:02,985
l've never been on horseback before
- Come, let's rest a while

693
01:43:15,969 --> 01:43:19,564
l didn't believe you would
come with me

694
01:43:20,240 --> 01:43:22,208
lt had become hard for me
to live in Lucknow

695
01:43:23,510 --> 01:43:27,674
l don't know why my heart
made me come with you

696
01:43:29,249 --> 01:43:34,186
Do you know who l am ?
- What does it matter now ?

697
01:43:37,791 --> 01:43:39,691
Wait here. l'll bring water

698
01:44:12,992 --> 01:44:13,981
Faiz Ali, the outlaw !

699
01:45:06,279 --> 01:45:09,077
His horse
- He must be around

700
01:45:09,449 --> 01:45:10,507
You look there

701
01:46:21,754 --> 01:46:23,016
Who was Faiz Ali to you?

702
01:46:25,258 --> 01:46:29,558
What was his relation with you ?
- None.

703
01:46:31,231 --> 01:46:33,096
Did he kidnap you ?

704
01:46:35,034 --> 01:46:36,296
No

705
01:46:36,703 --> 01:46:40,230
You were with him of your free will?
- She's his prostitute

706
01:46:41,608 --> 01:46:45,203
Did you know that he was a dacoit?

707
01:46:47,213 --> 01:46:49,477
No

708
01:46:51,217 --> 01:46:54,880
You're from Lucknow?
- Yes

709
01:46:55,288 --> 01:46:56,277
What is your name?

710
01:47:07,400 --> 01:47:09,868
Were you with Faiz Ali ?
- Yes

711
01:47:10,270 --> 01:47:14,229
ls this same Umrao you told about?
- Yes

712
01:47:14,841 --> 01:47:18,402
How's Mother? When did you
leave Lucknow?

713
01:47:19,746 --> 01:47:21,475
Why don't you sit down?

714
01:47:25,151 --> 01:47:28,211
ln Lucknow everyone
thinks that you...

715
01:47:28,521 --> 01:47:31,649
Several times l thought
of writing

716
01:47:32,158 --> 01:47:38,324
But l was scared of Mother.
She'll come at once and take me away

717
01:47:38,631 --> 01:47:42,158
ls the Rajah a good man?
- Very

718
01:47:42,502 --> 01:47:44,800
The bandits would have
killed me that very day

719
01:47:45,204 --> 01:47:52,235
The Rajah - God bless him - caught
them. l've been with him ever since

720
01:47:52,578 --> 01:47:57,038
Are you happy ?
l'm a queen. l live in comfort

721
01:47:57,717 --> 01:48:01,483
Where were you going with Faiz Ali?
- Kanpur

722
01:48:02,355 --> 01:48:05,324
Where will you go now?
Back to Lucknow?

723
01:48:06,092 --> 01:48:10,119
lf l know where, l wouldn't
be wandering around

724
01:48:10,596 --> 01:48:11,927
Still...

725
01:48:14,667 --> 01:48:19,331
Can you get me escorted
to Kanpur ?

726
01:48:28,681 --> 01:48:41,355
''Whenever l meet life,
it seems a stranger to me''

727
01:48:42,261 --> 01:48:54,196
''Why does life change colors
everyday ?''

728
01:48:55,074 --> 01:49:06,144
''Why does life change colors
everyday ?''

729
01:49:10,723 --> 01:49:15,092
The evenings have become more
colorful since she came to Kanpur

730
01:49:15,428 --> 01:49:17,726
Listen, my friends

731
01:49:18,197 --> 01:49:20,028
You listen too, Umrao Jaan

732
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:23,563
Yesterday l passed a locality

733
01:49:23,970 --> 01:49:28,600
There was a song being sung
and a big crowd

734
01:49:28,908 --> 01:49:35,507
l listened carefully, and
it was a ghazal by Umrao Jaan

735
01:50:06,946 --> 01:50:11,076
Does the singer from Lucknow
live here?

736
01:50:11,317 --> 01:50:13,376
Yes. Go up the stairs

737
01:50:30,570 --> 01:50:33,198
Are you Umrao Jaan?
- Yes, ma'am

738
01:50:33,639 --> 01:50:38,906
Our lady has called you.
Tomorrow is her son's birthday

739
01:50:39,779 --> 01:50:41,804
She'd like you to perform

740
01:50:42,448 --> 01:50:44,939
How does she know me ?

741
01:50:45,251 --> 01:50:47,685
She is also from Lucknow

742
01:50:48,187 --> 01:50:50,087
You're from Lucknow, too

743
01:50:50,656 --> 01:50:55,252
How did you know ?
A certain style in your speech

744
01:50:56,229 --> 01:51:01,166
Keep this, the rest will be
settled later

745
01:51:02,468 --> 01:51:06,666
l'll keep it so the Begum
is not offended

746
01:51:07,106 --> 01:51:08,664
Right, then l'll go

747
01:52:14,974 --> 01:52:18,102
l feel we have met
somewhere before

748
01:52:19,145 --> 01:52:22,740
Strange. l was about to say
the same

749
01:52:42,868 --> 01:52:45,962
Are you - Amiran ?

750
01:52:49,709 --> 01:52:50,300
You're...

751
01:52:51,143 --> 01:52:55,204
Remember me ? l'm Ramdei

752
01:52:56,716 --> 01:53:09,652
''Since l parted from you
whom will l meet now ?''

753
01:53:10,563 --> 01:53:24,204
''See what colors
life shows me?''

754
01:53:24,377 --> 01:53:35,845
''See what colors
life shows me?''

755
01:53:39,759 --> 01:53:44,196
Amiran, if they'd chosen you
instead of me!

756
01:53:45,264 --> 01:53:50,463
Then you'd have got the
bordello and l this mansion

757
01:53:51,637 --> 01:53:54,435
Where is your husband ?

758
01:53:54,874 --> 01:53:57,843
He's gone to Calcutta.
He'll be back by tomorrow

759
01:53:58,711 --> 01:54:00,645
Now tell me about yourself

760
01:54:02,314 --> 01:54:08,480
Why? lt's a happy occasion,
talk of nice things

761
01:54:09,255 --> 01:54:12,418
Here's a suitable couplet

762
01:54:12,925 --> 01:54:25,702
''What a favor the passage
of time has done me''

763
01:54:26,772 --> 01:54:38,707
''That the earth seems
more beautiful than the moon''

764
01:54:39,151 --> 01:54:51,120
''That the earth seems
more beautiful than the moon''

765
01:55:14,086 --> 01:55:18,318
l forgot. Nawab Saheb,
this is Umrao Jaan

766
01:55:27,233 --> 01:55:29,030
Umrao Jaan's carriage
is ready

767
01:55:36,075 --> 01:55:40,876
Are you leaving?
- Yes, l ask your leave

768
01:55:43,549 --> 01:55:46,882
And if we refuse it?

769
01:56:07,873 --> 01:56:22,049
''l did not find
what l looked for''

770
01:56:22,988 --> 01:56:31,726
''l did not find
what l looked for''

771
01:56:32,064 --> 01:56:40,938
'' But this became an excuse
for seeing the world''

772
01:56:41,240 --> 01:56:44,767
''What l was looking for...''

773
01:57:04,730 --> 01:57:25,608
''l didn't embarrass you,
nor do l have any regrets''

774
01:57:25,985 --> 01:57:39,922
''Thus l maintained
the tradition of love''

775
01:57:40,165 --> 01:57:49,198
''Thus l maintained
the tradition of love''

776
01:57:49,608 --> 01:57:53,066
''What l lost...''

777
01:58:10,462 --> 01:58:30,680
''l don't remember when
l got you, when l lost you''

778
01:58:31,150 --> 01:58:45,053
''Life, l think l only saw you
in a dream''

779
01:58:45,464 --> 01:58:54,236
''Life, l think l only saw you
in a dream''

780
01:58:54,573 --> 01:58:58,441
''What l lost...''

781
01:59:17,997 --> 01:59:37,908
''Says 'Ada', what can l say
of my condition?''

782
01:59:38,817 --> 01:59:52,595
''The long journey of life
l traversed alone''

783
01:59:53,098 --> 02:00:01,904
''The long journey of life
l traversed alone''

784
02:00:02,207 --> 02:00:10,876
''l did not find
what l looked for''

785
02:00:11,250 --> 02:00:20,124
'' But this became an excuse
for seeing the world''

786
02:00:20,225 --> 02:00:24,286
''What l was looking for...''

787
02:00:36,256 --> 02:00:37,621
My child!

788
02:00:40,293 --> 02:00:45,822
How hard-hearted you are.
Don't you love anyone any more

789
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:55,265
Your Maulvi Saheb suffers so
much, thinking of you all the time

790
02:01:08,688 --> 02:01:09,950
How is Khanum?

791
02:01:10,390 --> 02:01:16,420
Losing her daughter half killed
her Losing you has finished her

792
02:01:21,535 --> 02:01:22,661
We have come
to take you back

793
02:01:51,665 --> 02:01:54,600
Umrao, where did you go ?

794
02:01:55,101 --> 02:01:59,162
You look quite well
- Why should l be ill?

795
02:01:59,573 --> 02:02:00,904
Aunt Husseini said you...

796
02:02:02,375 --> 02:02:06,778
What else could l say.
She wouldn't have come easily

797
02:02:07,514 --> 02:02:13,077
We brought her up, and now that
she's earning she goes her own way

798
02:02:14,387 --> 02:02:17,379
The dove lays the eggs
and the crow eats them

799
02:02:18,792 --> 02:02:22,592
So that's why you came to fetch me?
- Husseini, you are getting old

800
02:02:22,963 --> 02:02:26,194
She comes home after months
and you start talking rot

801
02:02:26,600 --> 02:02:29,763
Don't take it so hard.
She says any odd things

802
02:02:30,170 --> 02:02:33,037
No, l won't stay in Lucknow

803
02:02:33,707 --> 02:02:37,438
Stay till 'Muharram'.
Then you may go where you wish

804
02:02:37,844 --> 02:02:40,176
Come to me, my child

805
02:02:44,017 --> 02:02:46,281
Go to your room and rest

806
02:02:55,262 --> 02:02:57,162
She won't stay here

807
02:02:59,466 --> 02:03:03,630
The filly has started bucking
- So we'll fence her in

808
02:03:14,714 --> 02:03:20,949
Bless you, my child. God give you
the riches of knowledge

809
02:04:04,664 --> 02:04:06,495
Are you unwell?

810
02:04:08,768 --> 02:04:13,330
Should l massage your head?
- Let me be, l don't have a headache

811
02:04:15,108 --> 02:04:16,166
Even if you don't...

812
02:04:19,045 --> 02:04:22,674
Why this sudden show of love?
Short of cash?

813
02:04:23,116 --> 02:04:27,143
Why say such
un-poetic things?

814
02:04:28,288 --> 02:04:32,486
For a true lover, sweet words
of the beloved are enough

815
02:04:36,529 --> 02:04:38,463
What'll happen to me
when you leave?

816
02:04:39,733 --> 02:04:41,291
The same as last time

817
02:04:42,802 --> 02:04:49,105
She heard me weeping but
she did not even ask

818
02:04:49,709 --> 02:04:54,772
What is this sound of crying
that l hear?

819
02:04:57,884 --> 02:04:59,909
The old woman won't let you
go so easily

820
02:05:02,122 --> 02:05:05,114
Even if you leave,
she'll fetch you back

821
02:05:06,426 --> 02:05:07,984
There's only one way

822
02:05:10,663 --> 02:05:11,925
Get married to someone

823
02:05:13,700 --> 02:05:15,497
ls that a proposal?

824
02:05:16,836 --> 02:05:19,828
Really. You stand to gain...

825
02:05:20,907 --> 02:05:24,343
... by marrying me. Khanum's
hold on you will weaken

826
02:05:24,778 --> 02:05:28,737
And after marriage? l'll earn
and you'll eat

827
02:05:29,883 --> 02:05:32,852
l don't want to go out of the
frying-pan and into the fire

828
02:05:54,707 --> 02:05:56,572
ls your name Umrao Jaan?

829
02:05:57,210 --> 02:05:58,177
Yes

830
02:05:58,545 --> 02:06:06,179
l've come from the court. According
to this, Gohar Mirza submits

831
02:06:07,187 --> 02:06:12,819
... that his lawful wedded wife,
Umrao Jaan...

832
02:06:12,992 --> 02:06:18,624
... wants to live with another
man without getting a divorce

833
02:06:22,101 --> 02:06:26,765
The hearing is on the 18th.
Be present in the court

834
02:06:27,173 --> 02:06:29,607
Your statements will be recorded.
Here's the summons

835
02:07:29,168 --> 02:07:32,604
This is a copy of our
marriage contract

836
02:07:36,276 --> 02:07:39,973
Apart from Aunty and Khanum, some
15 others were present at the wedding

837
02:07:42,815 --> 02:07:47,479
Your obstinacy forced me to spend
a lot of money. But l had to do it

838
02:08:07,307 --> 02:08:13,678
lt's false. All this
is false

839
02:08:28,861 --> 02:08:32,262
l swear, Umrao,
l'm not to blame

840
02:08:34,767 --> 02:08:36,826
Actually, Khanum is
not to blame either

841
02:08:38,404 --> 02:08:40,395
At this age, what else
can she do?

842
02:08:42,308 --> 02:08:44,469
Wait till the new girl
grows up?

843
02:08:47,780 --> 02:08:49,680
lt's our fate
that is to blame

844
02:08:51,217 --> 02:08:54,209
Not fate: circumstances

845
02:08:59,359 --> 02:09:01,190
Can't you withdraw
the case?

846
02:09:04,030 --> 02:09:07,557
One who has lived off
Khanum's leftovers would not dare

847
02:09:09,202 --> 02:09:12,968
Go to Kanpur. My house
is empty

848
02:09:14,607 --> 02:09:16,268
What will l eat?

849
02:10:19,505 --> 02:10:23,407
Damn Gohar Mirza. He had to
leave at such a time

850
02:10:24,177 --> 02:10:25,974
The British are in
every alley

851
02:10:32,318 --> 02:10:33,842
God help us

852
02:10:47,767 --> 02:10:53,000
They'll break down the gate.
Go out, over the wall

853
02:12:20,793 --> 02:12:24,991
This is Faizabad. The convoy for
Beneras will leave in the morning

854
02:12:25,765 --> 02:12:31,032
We'll have to spend the night here
- ln this wilderness?

855
02:12:31,437 --> 02:12:33,428
Can't help it

856
02:12:33,773 --> 02:12:35,604
Our blessed fate!

857
02:13:39,939 --> 02:13:46,606
''That which has no face''

858
02:13:46,979 --> 02:13:52,212
''That which has no name''

859
02:13:52,752 --> 02:14:25,212
''Why do l long for such a thing''

860
02:14:27,787 --> 02:14:32,520
ln Faizabad, your poetry has made a
greater mark than even your singing

861
02:14:33,025 --> 02:14:35,926
lnvitation for performances
would be welcome

862
02:14:36,629 --> 02:14:38,563
Poetry is not enough
for a living

863
02:14:39,165 --> 02:14:41,292
Recall your performance
at our place

864
02:15:00,186 --> 02:15:08,924
''What place is this, my friends''

865
02:15:13,332 --> 02:15:19,737
''What place is this, my friends''

866
02:15:20,139 --> 02:15:24,735
''What location is this?''

867
02:15:25,111 --> 02:15:29,673
''What location is this?''

868
02:15:32,051 --> 02:15:52,360
''Where, as far as one can see,
there's dust and only dust?''

869
02:15:52,872 --> 02:15:59,778
''What place is this, my friends''

870
02:16:26,605 --> 02:16:41,179
''To what juncture...''

871
02:16:41,487 --> 02:16:49,986
''...has life now brought me?''

872
02:16:52,264 --> 02:17:12,448
''Where l have no control
over sorrow or joy''

873
02:17:12,818 --> 02:17:19,587
''What place is this, my friends''

874
02:17:19,758 --> 02:17:23,922
''What location is this?''

875
02:17:24,163 --> 02:17:29,066
''What location is this?''

876
02:17:51,190 --> 02:18:12,273
''Life asks an account
of the days gone by''

877
02:18:14,346 --> 02:18:34,427
''My heart has no answer.
lt's full of remorse''

878
02:18:35,201 --> 02:18:41,401
''What place is this, my friends''

879
02:18:41,707 --> 02:18:45,973
''What location is this?''

880
02:18:46,312 --> 02:18:50,874
''What location is this?''

881
02:19:09,235 --> 02:19:29,521
'' Beyond the blinds
who beckons me?''

882
02:19:29,888 --> 02:19:50,197
''ls someone still sad and
restless for me?''

883
02:19:50,509 --> 02:19:56,846
''What place is this,
my friends?''

884
02:19:57,149 --> 02:20:01,518
''What location is this?''

885
02:20:01,854 --> 02:20:05,688
''What location is this?''

886
02:20:06,625 --> 02:20:19,436
''Where, as far as one can see,
there's dust and only dust?''

887
02:20:19,805 --> 02:20:29,703
''What place is this, my friends''

888
02:21:03,121 --> 02:21:06,716
You're the one from Lucknow?
- Yes

889
02:21:07,192 --> 02:21:13,392
What is your name?
- How does it matter?

890
02:21:13,832 --> 02:21:17,233
Are you a prostitute
by birth?

891
02:21:18,703 --> 02:21:22,605
No, by force of
circumstances

892
02:21:23,809 --> 02:21:28,109
Say something about yourself.
Who are you?

893
02:21:28,880 --> 02:21:33,180
How can l say who l am?

894
02:21:33,518 --> 02:21:36,510
Where is your real home?

895
02:21:37,756 --> 02:21:42,420
My real home is
where l'm standing now

896
02:21:46,731 --> 02:21:52,795
Are you Amiran ?

897
02:22:00,412 --> 02:22:03,006
Where did you go,
my darling?

898
02:22:04,149 --> 02:22:08,711
Where are Father and my brother?
- Your father died long back

899
02:22:11,323 --> 02:22:17,353
My darling! Where did you go?

900
02:22:24,302 --> 02:22:32,175
Deserting your mother's world,
which world have you settled in?

901
02:22:36,248 --> 02:22:42,209
No, Mother, this is not Amiran, this
is Umrao Jaan, the famous courtesan

902
02:22:50,428 --> 02:22:52,020
Brother!

903
02:22:53,532 --> 02:22:55,864
You've brought glory
to the family

904
02:22:57,769 --> 02:23:00,499
We thought you were dead

905
02:23:02,307 --> 02:23:07,574
But you're still alive.
You should have drowned yourself

906
02:23:08,079 --> 02:23:09,944
lt'll be better
if you go away

907
02:23:23,528 --> 02:23:25,223
My child
