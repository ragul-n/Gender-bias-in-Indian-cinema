1
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:21,209
Open up!
Open up!

2
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,495
Sanjay!
What on earth are you doing?

3
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:33,057
How many times do I have to tell you
to behave yourself?

4
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:35,530
You just won't listen!

5
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:40,404
Sanjay, Maya is okay.
No one's harming her.

6
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:42,173
Open the door!

7
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:44,800
What's wrong with you?
Stop before you kill the boy!

8
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:01,479
What type of acting
can Shah Rukh Khan do?

9
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:03,344
Tell me that.

10
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:08,480
All he can do
is yell and shout.

11
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:12,014
That's all he does.

12
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,683
Forget about today's actors.

13
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:17,262
Go watch the real thing,
old Yusef Khan's pictures.

14
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:21,159
- Sir, I'd like some candy.
- Candy? How much?

15
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:24,996
- Half a pound.
- Half a pound of candy for the boy.

16
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:29,400
- How's your daddy?
- He's fine.

17
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:32,569
- And school?
- Good.

18
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:34,511
Sir! There are goats in your field!

19
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,639
What?

20
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:38,046
Goats in my field?

21
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:39,277
Get out!

22
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:43,986
Get away!

23
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:46,418
I'll let you eat the samosa
if you show me yours.

24
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:07,729
Now you can't have the samosa.

25
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,104
But I'll show you mine

26
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:11,642
if you show me yours.

27
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:44,166
Where were you two?
Always gallivanting about!

28
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,838
I said cauliflower, not cabbage.

29
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:50,712
You know the children hate cabbage.

30
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,151
Go wash up and get lunch.

31
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:55,982
- We were just...
- Maya!

32
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,320
- But we weren't...
- What did I just tell you? Go.

33
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,171
- Where have you two been?
- We were...

34
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:19,073
Yeah, yeah. Hurry.

35
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:30,821
Maya, take a look.

36
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:34,222
- What?
- It's a lizard. Here, hold it.

37
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:37,589
Sanjay, throw it away.

38
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:40,664
- Try holding it.
- It'll bite!

39
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:41,893
Come on.

40
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:44,663
Look, I'm holding it. Try!

41
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:48,036
No, it'll bite us.
Please, throw it away.

42
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:55,069
It's just a lizard.
You don't have to be scared. Chicken!

43
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,843
- Maya's a chicken!
- Enough!

44
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,008
Don't trouble her.

45
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:00,585
Lion Heart!

46
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:01,880
Shut up and eat.

47
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:07,926
Eat!

48
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:10,254
Shall I?

49
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:11,887
- But -
- Arun!

50
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:14,831
I'm ruined!
I'm finished!

51
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,731
They will destroy me!

52
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,804
What's happened?
What's wrong, Shankar?

53
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:21,874
Arun, sir!
Where do I start?

54
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:25,205
Your kids came to buy sweets
this morning and lied to me

55
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:29,407
about goats in my field.
When I ran out, they stole everything.

56
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:31,574
Those fucking motherfuckers!

57
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:34,517
I won't curse. I won't curse.

58
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,882
But those fucking...

59
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,550
I won't curse.

60
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:41,092
But your kids are brats.

61
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:46,723
It's all Maya's fault.

62
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:50,633
You should send her back
to her parents.

63
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:53,762
I'm telling you, sir,
she's corrupting Sanjay.

64
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,934
Sir, I'm a poor candy man.

65
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,135
I work hard for a living.

66
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,337
How can I survive like this?

67
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:01,743
You're incorrigible.

68
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:04,879
Poor guy.

69
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:09,181
"I'm ruined! I'm finished!"

70
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,759
I was even worse
when I was your age.

71
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:16,852
It's a lot of fun, isn't it?

72
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,268
Don't worry, Shankar.

73
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:25,234
It'll be all right.

74
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,670
But, sir... how?

75
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:33,341
This should be enough.
I assure you it will never happen again.

76
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:37,782
Oh! It's perfectly all right.

77
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,479
After all, they're only children.

78
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:45,853
They'll always act their age,
and they should.

79
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,486
Do go easy on them.

80
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:49,959
It's no big deal.

81
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:53,463
And what do they have
to worry about anyway

82
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:55,534
with such generous parents...

83
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,830
- That's quite all right.
- But I mean it.

84
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:03,141
Everybody knows
how generous you are.

85
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:08,574
They say you gave an expensive
gift at the Naidus' feast today.

86
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,807
They don't have your class,

87
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:16,519
but the Naidus are almost
as generous as you.

88
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:17,680
Shankar.

89
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,348
I mean it.

90
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:26,388
I wasn't there, but I can safely say
the feast must have been generous.

91
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:29,798
Well, the feast was indeed quite good.

92
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:34,996
The timing was god-given,
as the girl turned 13 today.

93
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:37,337
Hallelujah!

94
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:40,503
But Arun, sir,
forget the Naidus of the world.

95
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:44,572
When it's time for
Maya's celebration,

96
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:50,122
the feast you have
will be remembered forever.

97
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:53,719
But you must promise me,
Arun, sir,

98
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:57,489
that I will be the caterer.

99
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,997
We'll see.
I'll check with the missus.

100
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,999
Are you happy now?

101
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,304
Sanjay.

102
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,176
Maya.

103
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,147
Ganesh.

104
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:17,044
- Have you seen the kids?
- No, sir.

105
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,037
It was my fault.

106
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,765
Maya's not to blame.

107
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:54,879
If you ever pull a stunt like that
again, I will not spare you.

108
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,454
Go to your room!

109
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:59,991
You're grounded till dinner.

110
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:01,693
Go!

111
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:16,801
See, I told you it would work.
What would you do without me?

112
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:19,537
Yeah, yeah!
"What would you do without me?"

113
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,753
What?
I don’t want to play with you.

114
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,880
Fine! I'm heading out.

115
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:36,223
I'm going to spend
the whole afternoon having fun.

116
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:39,661
And if Mommy and Daddy
catch you?

117
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:42,563
You don't have the guts!
Chicken!

118
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:45,136
I'm not scared.
I'm just not stupid.

119
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:47,364
Sit and suffer then.
I'm gone.

120
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,373
Wait. I'll come along.

121
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:51,773
And if Mommy and Daddy
catch you?

122
00:11:58,117 --> 00:11:59,584
Let's go.

123
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,249
"Arun, sir. Arun, sir.

124
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:36,321
I'm ruined! I'm finished!

125
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:40,017
- They will destroy me!"
- Not like that. Let me show you.

126
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:43,058
"Arun, sir! Arun, sir!
I'm ruined! I'm finished!

127
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:46,154
They will destroy me!

128
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:49,632
What am I to do? Oh, what?"

129
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:34,136
Sons of bitches!

130
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:37,579
Why don’t you come out?
Motherfuckers!

131
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:39,344
Motherfuckers!

132
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:43,012
You fucks!
I'll rip your fucking asses!

133
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:45,283
Motherfucking sons of bitches!

134
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,559
Go fuck yourselves!

135
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,138
Ganesh.

136
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:10,981
Lakshmi.

137
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:13,718
Where's my tea?

138
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,778
What took you so long?
Is the children's milk ready?

139
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:45,908
Give it to them.

140
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:59,197
You raise hell for tea
and now you’re asleep.

141
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:00,595
I've been waiting forever.

142
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:04,066
Then do something about
the lizards while you wait.

143
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:06,330
They're all over the place.

144
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,439
What are you thinking?

145
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:14,171
You know Shankar is right.

146
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,872
Don't start.

147
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:18,279
Kids are mischievous.

148
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:20,682
And Shankar's melodrama is
his habit.

149
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:22,913
I was thinking about Maya.

150
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:25,013
Maya is still a child.

151
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:30,917
Don't pay attention to Shankar.
He'll say anything for money.

152
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:36,692
If you need me,
I'm in the kitchen.

153
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:39,930
Besides, if dinner isn't ready
on time, you'll raise hell.

154
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:44,708
You're still asleep?

155
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,210
Ganesh,
where is the children's milk?

156
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:50,545
Coming!

157
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:54,107
- You take forever.
- Master needed another tea.

158
00:15:57,823 --> 00:15:59,757
Stop making faces
and drink your milk.

159
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:01,758
- I don't like it.
- Drink!

160
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,791
Listen to me very carefully.

161
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:09,266
If you ever do that again,

162
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:12,997
I'll smack you
till you can't stand candy.

163
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:18,806
Come with me to the kitchen.

164
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:22,509
You wash up and hit the books.

165
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:24,206
- But school's out.
- So?

166
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,468
- Did you wash down the yard?
- No.

167
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,366
Do you expect me to do it?

168
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,111
What do we have for dinner?

169
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:03,484
The eggplant's slightly overdone.
Don't start on it.

170
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,216
What did I say?

171
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:07,758
I think the food looks great.

172
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,990
Smells great too!

173
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:15,690
Daddy.

174
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:20,501
Sanjay, shut up and
eat your food.

175
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:23,300
Have some greens.

176
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:31,708
I said have some greens!

177
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:40,988
Sanjay! Wash properly.

178
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:08,586
Mommy!

179
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:12,023
Lakshmi!

180
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:14,422
Lakshmi? Getting cheeky!

181
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:16,826
What?

182
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,056
- Tell us a story.
- Tomorrow.

183
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:22,292
- It's always tomorrow.
- Yeah, tell us a story.

184
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:23,425
I said tomorrow.

185
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:26,837
What's with the scream?

186
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:33,007
Mommy, please tell us a story.

187
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,773
Maya's afraid.

188
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,347
I'm not afraid.

189
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:40,350
She has nothing to fear.
She has you. Time to sleep.

190
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,919
Mommy, tell us a story.

191
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:44,181
Please, Mommy.

192
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:48,223
Oh, all right.

193
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:50,695
What do you want to hear?

194
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,423
Tell us about a king.

195
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,627
Let's see. A king...

196
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:00,702
Once upon a time

197
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:04,736
there lived a very brave
and generous king.

198
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:07,778
He was greatly loved
by his people.

199
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:13,544
Everyone was happy. The land was
filled with joy and prosperity.

200
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:17,315
Everyone had decent food
and clothing, and no one was poor.

201
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:21,320
One day a great sage
showed up at his court.

202
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,457
The sage had long hair
and glowing eyes.

203
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:30,568
The king immediately recognized
the greatness of the sage

204
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:35,431
and treated him with great respect.

205
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:39,974
How come the sages who come
to our village are treated so badly?

206
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:42,842
Long hair and a flowing beard
do not make a sage.

207
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:46,907
Only those with insight
into life are sages.

208
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,352
Anyway, the king treated the sage
well and kept him in his palace.

209
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:55,290
Why don’t we keep a sage at home?

210
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:59,426
- Do you want to hear the story?
- Stop interrupting her.

211
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:01,098
- But you did.
- Shut up.

212
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,827
Now don't start!

213
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,397
Do you want to hear the story?

214
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:07,131
Fine, I'm leaving.

215
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:11,302
Mommy, please finish the story.
We won't say a word.

216
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,207
Yes, we'll be very quiet.

217
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:14,609
- Promise?
- Yes.

218
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,510
- Fight's over?
- Yes.

219
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:19,083
No more interruptions?

220
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:20,378
None at all.

221
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:24,886
- Where was I?
- The sage stayed with the king.

222
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:30,926
He stayed with the king and was
so impressed by his hospitality

223
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:35,693
that he gave him
an amulet as a gift when he left.

224
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:39,532
He instructed the king

225
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:45,574
not to open the amulet
unless he was in dire straits

226
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:47,504
and all else had failed.

227
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:50,038
And then he left.

228
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:53,651
The king ruled for many years,

229
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:58,186
until a neighboring king,
who was his enemy,

230
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,520
suddenly attacked him.

231
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:03,851
Our king fought very bravely.

232
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:09,057
But he lost and had to flee.

233
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:13,570
Now what’s a king
without a kingdom?

234
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:17,033
The king had lost all hope

235
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:20,903
and thought:
"What's the point of living?"

236
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:24,847
Then he suddenly remembered
the amulet around his neck.

237
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:29,910
He opened it to find
a piece of paper that said,

238
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:34,525
"This too shall pass."

239
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:38,924
These words gave
the king new strength.

240
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:41,556
He worked hard for two years

241
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:45,434
and raised a new army.

242
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:47,300
He attacked his enemy,

243
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:51,069
and after a bloody battle,

244
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,569
he won his kingdom back.

245
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:58,238
Just think.
Wasn't that a gift worth receiving?

246
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,448
What use is a gift like that?

247
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:05,922
I'd wish to be able to fly.

248
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:07,389
My little idiot.

249
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,119
Yeah! Idiot!

250
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:10,854
Don't start again!

251
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:14,525
Mommy,
what does the saying mean?

252
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:20,966
It means that
if you are good children

253
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:26,010
and don't make trouble
like you did today,

254
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:29,706
then whatever trouble
comes your way will pass on.

255
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,550
Understand?

256
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:35,779
Now straight to bed.

257
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:02,108
- Are they asleep?
- Yeah. They insisted on hearing a story.

258
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:05,843
Really?
I'd love to hear one, too.

259
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:13,021
I got a telegram from Mridu today.

260
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:15,585
They needed some money.

261
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:18,255
Send it.

262
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,495
You're so caring.

263
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:26,830
Especially towards Maya,

264
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:30,834
as if she were your daughter
and not your niece.

265
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:32,907
She is our daughter,

266
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:36,907
but if she had a younger sister,
it would be great.

267
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,323
When did it start? When?

268
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,757
- What started, Mommy?
- Shut up. When?

269
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:38,385
- It's started! It's started!
- Shut up!

270
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:42,125
Shut up!
Go ask Ganesh to give you milk.

271
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:45,136
Don't cry, honey.

272
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:49,200
This happens when girls grow up.

273
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:51,434
Don't be afraid.
I'll be right back.

274
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:57,944
I'll go take a look.

275
00:27:06,324 --> 00:27:09,350
You're back?
I told you to get your milk.

276
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,486
- Why?
- Because I said so.

277
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:12,790
Out!

278
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:18,898
Don't cry, love.
You're my grown-up girl now.

279
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:22,838
This will go on for a week.
Here, put this on.

280
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:28,308
Don't worry if your stomach aches.
We'll have almond dessert every day.

281
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:29,971
Lift up your nightgown.

282
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:36,079
Put your legs through this.

283
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,715
Now the other one.

284
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:50,766
No exertion for a week.

285
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,098
All right?

286
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,656
- The master's tea?
- I'm about to...

287
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:14,816
I'll take it.

288
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,499
Still struggling with your milk?

289
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:45,315
What's wrong?

290
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:47,423
I was with the children.

291
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:51,194
- And?
- Let me finish.

292
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:53,526
Maya has started her period.

293
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,865
Shankar's quite the prophet.

294
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:04,441
He should be an astrologer,
not a candy man.

295
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:06,703
Forget him.

296
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,105
How is Maya?

297
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:29,759
Tell me, why was Mommy so mad?
What did you do?

298
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:31,165
I'm not sure,

299
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:36,366
but I think it's because
I pissed in the courtyard.

300
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:38,101
Yuk!

301
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:40,439
There was a lizard
in the bathroom.

302
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:43,514
I didn't know lizards
were afraid of lizards.

303
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:47,113
What did Mommy say
after I was sent out?

304
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:49,345
Nothing.
She gave me a cloth to put on.

305
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,922
- Well! Show me.
- No.

306
00:29:52,023 --> 00:29:54,048
- Why?
- Mommy said so.

307
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:56,655
- Does Daddy know?
- I don't know.

308
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:59,321
He's going to thrash you
when he finds out.

309
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,763
Let's do one thing.

310
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,107
Send Ganesh down
to Vivek's village

311
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:12,938
to start preparations
for the ceremony.

312
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:16,709
We'll arrive with Maya
in a few days.

313
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:20,444
And listen.

314
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,820
Send some money as well.

315
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,907
Have the children had their milk?

316
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,601
I'll take it to them.

317
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:49,304
Take this money to Mridu.

318
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:51,382
Tell them to prepare
for the prayer ceremony.

319
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,018
And hurry!
There's lots to be done.

320
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,336
Ganesh!

321
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,538
There's a lizard in the room.

322
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:27,073
Lakshmi!

323
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,202
What is it?

324
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,378
Won't do anything
around the house!

325
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:56,379
Ganesh doesn't answer,
so I have to kill the lizard.

326
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:58,779
Like that's all I have to do!

327
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:01,044
- What is it?
- Over here!

328
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,298
Two Popsicles please.

329
00:32:56,774 --> 00:33:01,074
- What if we get caught?
- You're always scared.

330
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:05,115
By the time anyone finds out,

331
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:08,151
we'll be at Aunty Mridu's place.

332
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:29,037
- Shankar.
- Arun, sir! Get some tea for sir!

333
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,540
It's all right.
Have you seen our kids?

334
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:33,769
They haven't come to my store.

335
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:37,279
And I haven't seen them
run out of anyone else's.

336
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,645
Get back to work!

337
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,989
Good, huh?

338
00:34:02,673 --> 00:34:07,804
Let us go! Let us go!
I'll kill you!

339
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:12,372
Let us go!
Put me down, Ganesh! Let us go!

340
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:19,986
Shut up!

341
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,423
Arun, sir!

342
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:59,326
I had to look all over the village
before I found them.

343
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,397
Where are they?

344
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:02,966
I locked them up.
Please go easy on them.

345
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:04,932
Go get the food ready.

346
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:09,732
I'm not running away.
I'm going to pee!

347
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:13,043
Maya, honey.

348
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:16,547
Why did you run away?

349
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:20,676
Don't be afraid. Come.

350
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:24,152
Should you run away like that?
We were so worried.

351
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:27,324
Where were you all this time?

352
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:28,892
Tell me.

353
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:31,793
It wasn't her fault.
It was my idea.

354
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:36,133
In that case, enlighten us, please.

355
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:38,702
Mommy yelled at Maya.

356
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:45,403
Come.

357
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:54,616
When did I yell at you?

358
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:59,850
I just asked you
not to exert yourself for a week.

359
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:05,355
Besides, grown-up girls don't pee in
the courtyard. What if someone saw you?

360
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,095
Next time use the bathroom.

361
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:12,895
But, Mommy, what if there are
lizards in the bathroom?

362
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:21,241
And what if the Popsicle guy
had taken all your money?

363
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:25,008
That wouldn’t happen.
I just gave him 10 rupees.

364
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:27,676
He didn't know how much I had.

365
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:32,947
Don't be a smart-aleck
or you’ll get a thrashing.

366
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:35,616
Focus on your studies.

367
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:40,723
Come on! Catch me! Try!

368
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:43,766
Sanjay, Maya, come for dinner.

369
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,996
Come on! Catch me!

370
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:57,075
How many times do I have to holler?
Come on, Daddy's here.

371
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:06,256
Maya, stay out of the kitchen.

372
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:07,255
Lakshmi?

373
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:09,189
This is why we ran away!

374
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:13,423
Shut up, blabbermouth!
We'll eat in the living room.

375
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:16,159
Ganesh, serve us in there.
Let's go.

376
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:26,736
Sleep.

377
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:37,584
- Did Mommy scold you?
- No. She just told me I had grown up.

378
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:41,283
Yeah! Suddenly you’ve grown up
and I'm still a child!

379
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:42,859
I guess so.

380
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,520
You haven't grown up.
You've gone mad.

381
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:47,093
Fine.

382
00:37:58,142 --> 00:38:00,610
- How is Maya holding up?
- She's fine.

383
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:01,678
I think...

384
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,246
Madam!

385
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:06,180
- What is it?
- I'm leaving.

386
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:11,321
- You know what you’re to say?
- Yes.

387
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:13,481
Give them the money first.
Then tell them about the feast.

388
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:15,058
Now go.

389
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:17,227
- But...
- What?

390
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:18,795
I... some money...

391
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:21,228
- I gave you some money.
- But I...

392
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:23,266
It's a never ending story.

393
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:26,336
- How much did you spend?
- 200 or 250 rupees.

394
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:33,070
- Here.
- Thank you.

395
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:36,506
- Will he make it to the village?
- God knows.

396
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,124
Sanjay, wake up.

397
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:51,795
Come on, rise and shine.

398
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:56,430
- Where are we going?
- Get dressed. You'll see.

399
00:38:56,534 --> 00:39:00,163
Sanjay, the water's hot.
Hurry or it's a cold bath for you.

400
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:28,194
- Oh, no.
- It's the brake inspectors again!

401
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:33,192
- Such a beautiful calf.
- Yup! Just like you.

402
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:37,540
Daddy, where are we going?

403
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:41,441
We're going to Maya's home,
to see her parents.

404
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:45,003
That's where we were going
had Ganesh not caught us.

405
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:48,978
"Had Ganesh not caught us"!

406
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,649
Sanjay! What are you doing?

407
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:09,716
That's no way to knock on a door.

408
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:19,825
- You guys! Come in!
- How's the pregnancy?

409
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:26,141
Look who’s here!

410
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:27,666
Guri!

411
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:32,015
- How are you, Vivek?
- Fine.

412
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:35,745
- What a surprise.
- Surprise? Didn't Ganesh tell you?

413
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:38,151
Ganesh? He hasn't been here.

414
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:40,847
That guy is completely useless.

415
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,152
Sanjay, Guri, come back!

416
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:46,456
Sanjay, this is no time to play!

417
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:51,062
We sent him a day early.

418
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:54,297
He must be off getting drunk.

419
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,600
Thief! Thief!

420
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,108
Ganesh! Let him go!

421
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:03,202
Why are you covering his mouth?

422
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:06,816
Is this any time to get here?
After we’ve arrived?

423
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:09,050
Where were you?

424
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:12,919
Weren’t you told to come
and tell Vivek we were coming

425
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:14,916
and deliver the money?

426
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:17,484
Is anything left
or did you blow all the cash?

427
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:19,256
Getting drunk?

428
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:21,397
What's with you?

429
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:23,762
You have a death wish?
I can get you some rat poison.

430
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:26,335
It'll be a quicker death!

431
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:32,007
- What did the doctors say?
- They've given me medicine.

432
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:33,736
You must take better care.

433
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:36,472
Remember the complications
with Guri's delivery.

434
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:40,607
- Why are you sitting with my mother?
- She's your sister!

435
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:42,879
Go play with Sanjay.

436
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:45,455
Go!

437
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:52,622
- Are you drinking almond milk?
- No.

438
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:54,322
I'll make you some.

439
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:57,559
You be the Thief,
you the Bandit.

440
00:43:57,668 --> 00:43:59,295
And what do we make you?

441
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:01,030
You be the Cop.

442
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:04,073
Actually, you can't play a Bandit.

443
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:07,974
Bandits are very dangerous.
I'll teach you next time.

444
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:10,805
This time you’re the Bandit
and you're the Thief.

445
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:12,711
Why have you come to my house?

446
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:17,480
So that we can feed you
to the animals tonight

447
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:19,215
and live here without you.

448
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,120
No! You're lying!

449
00:44:22,626 --> 00:44:25,254
This color really suits you.
You must keep it.

450
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:28,229
- I can't.
- But you must. I insist.

451
00:44:28,532 --> 00:44:31,899
- I'm older than you.
- No, I can't.

452
00:44:32,736 --> 00:44:35,637
What? Sponging another sari
for your collection?

453
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:38,867
What's it to you?
Not everyone thinks like you.

454
00:44:38,976 --> 00:44:43,106
- This does suit you. Keep it.
- Yes, it does look good.

455
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:46,006
Maya, go play outside.

456
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:49,849
- Where is the prayer paraphernalia?
- Ganesh is getting it.

457
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:53,212
- How about some tea?
- I'll make some.

458
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:54,790
You rest. Ganesh!

459
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:10,936
It's no use.
We’ll still feed you to the lion!

460
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:26,312
Who's going to save you now?

461
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:33,989
I don't think we should use Ramulu.
He overcharges.

462
00:45:34,098 --> 00:45:37,727
But he does cook well.

463
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:42,564
I don't think we should make
a big deal of it.

464
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:45,904
Come on!
She's our only daughter.

465
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:47,806
And this ceremony only
happens once.

466
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:50,038
I can't believe
she's grown up so quickly.

467
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:53,947
We should keep it small.
We must watch the expense.

468
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:56,042
Don’t worry about the expense.

469
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:58,986
Oh, no! You've already done
so much for us.

470
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:02,547
Come now, Mridu.
Isn't she our daughter as well?

471
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,023
She is your daughter.

472
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:10,856
We would never have been able
to do what you've done for her.

473
00:46:10,968 --> 00:46:15,428
Stop that. We're all family.

474
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:20,174
Listen. We should meet the priest
and finalize everything.

475
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,074
We don't have a lot of time.

476
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:23,146
Yeah.

477
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:49,831
Put the comb down.
Put this on.

478
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:55,407
You aren't ready? Hurry up
or you won't get breakfast!

479
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:10,953
Where is that fool?

480
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,633
The children's milk!

481
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:19,361
I'm getting it.

482
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:52,857
- I'm done.
- Finish it.

483
00:47:54,905 --> 00:47:58,705
Stop being so slow, Ganesh.
There's so much to be done.

484
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:03,368
Maya, hurry up.
You have to put on your new dress.

485
00:48:04,348 --> 00:48:06,816
You said not to wear it when I play.

486
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:10,045
You can't play today.
There are guests coming to see you.

487
00:48:10,153 --> 00:48:11,142
But...

488
00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:13,849
No buts. Finish your meal.

489
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:16,084
- But you said...
- Don't butt in!

490
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:18,093
Or you’ll have to stay as well.

491
00:48:18,195 --> 00:48:22,188
Don't butt in or you’ll stay.

492
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:23,964
Stop it!

493
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:26,626
Come here!

494
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:45,051
Don't sulk.
Go and change.

495
00:48:46,123 --> 00:48:50,321
Go. You're a grown-up girl now,
so act like one.

496
00:48:50,627 --> 00:48:52,219
Go and change.

497
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:13,738
Ganesh! Where are you?

498
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:16,051
How many times
do I have to call you?

499
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:48,951
Please sit down.

500
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:52,383
- Sorry to have kept you waiting.
- That's quite all right.

501
00:49:52,923 --> 00:49:57,019
You see, I had to go to the
neighboring village for a ceremony.

502
00:49:58,161 --> 00:49:59,958
You know those people, Vivek.

503
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:02,896
Subba Rao?
Yes, that family.

504
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:07,662
Anyway, I had to perform the
ceremony and then attend the feast.

505
00:50:09,873 --> 00:50:12,899
My stomach is so sensitive as it is.

506
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:15,774
But I can't refuse.
That would be a disservice to God.

507
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:18,211
And if I eat,
my stomach gets upset.

508
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:21,146
I serve God

509
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,479
and I suffer.

510
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:29,115
Anyway,
how can I suffer for you?

511
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:33,857
Well, you see,
Maya has reached puberty.

512
00:50:35,732 --> 00:50:38,030
We need an auspicious day
for her ceremony.

513
00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:40,660
We didn't expect it so soon...

514
00:50:40,771 --> 00:50:46,004
That's good! The earlier it is,
the more God loves her.

515
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,671
An auspicious date?

516
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:28,549
Today is charted as...

517
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:31,247
Excuse me.

518
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:34,083
I'll be right back.

519
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:03,514
Like I said,
the service of God isn't easy.

520
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:06,579
Where were we?

521
00:52:50,767 --> 00:52:53,361
The 27th is very auspicious.

522
00:52:55,038 --> 00:52:57,006
I have to perform
another ceremony that day.

523
00:52:57,107 --> 00:52:59,575
It's fixed,
but I'll confirm tomorrow.

524
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:02,008
Very well.

525
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:03,579
God bless.

526
00:53:20,463 --> 00:53:23,398
Why did they come to see you?
Did you get any gifts or candy?

527
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:24,728
What's it to you?

528
00:53:24,834 --> 00:53:26,665
You ran off to play.

529
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:29,330
If you share the candy,
I'll take you with me.

530
00:53:29,439 --> 00:53:31,737
- I don't want to play anymore.
- Then don't!

531
00:53:31,841 --> 00:53:34,639
We had fun.
You can sit and sulk.

532
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:02,804
Hold on!
You won't get away with this!

533
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:04,533
I won't spare you!

534
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,419
How did you find out about it?

535
00:54:57,527 --> 00:55:01,554
Raju, a boy from the village,
showed it to me.

536
00:55:02,532 --> 00:55:04,159
But there's nothing here.

537
00:55:04,267 --> 00:55:05,757
Be patient.

538
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:10,465
We must have waited
almost half a day to see it.

539
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,280
- Is lunch ready?
- Yes, it is.

540
00:55:25,388 --> 00:55:26,855
Then serve the kids.

541
00:55:26,956 --> 00:55:29,516
- Must I tell you everything?
- They've gone out.

542
00:55:29,626 --> 00:55:31,218
What? They must be in their room.

543
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,592
I saw them
run out of the house.

544
00:55:33,697 --> 00:55:35,562
And you just watched?

545
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:36,791
This Sanjay is...

546
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:05,392
Wait! You can't get away!

547
00:56:05,495 --> 00:56:07,122
I won't spare you!

548
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:18,371
- Did you find the kids?
- No.

549
00:56:20,243 --> 00:56:24,202
How many times do I have to tell you
to keep an eye on the children?

550
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:27,016
We have such a big day
coming up,

551
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:29,948
and you never learn
from your mistakes.

552
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:32,087
Do you even care?

553
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:33,655
- But -
- Shut up!

554
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:42,624
- Where were you?
- Where is Guri?

555
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:44,199
He's on his way.

556
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:48,370
We didn't run away.
We just went out to play.

557
00:56:48,471 --> 00:56:49,438
Really?

558
00:56:49,973 --> 00:56:52,339
You're getting too big
for your boots.

559
00:56:53,343 --> 00:56:54,571
You didn't run away?

560
00:56:54,677 --> 00:56:56,577
You were playing?

561
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:58,271
Who did you ask at home?

562
00:56:58,381 --> 00:57:02,215
These two are kids,
but you’ve grown up now.

563
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:03,785
You should use your head.

564
00:57:03,887 --> 00:57:07,015
You're out of control
and you're out to corrupt Maya.

565
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:10,092
Get inside!

566
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:33,308
Is anyone home?

567
00:58:35,879 --> 00:58:37,506
Is anyone home?

568
00:58:38,381 --> 00:58:39,678
Arun, sir!

569
00:58:45,488 --> 00:58:47,115
Hello, your Holiness.

570
00:58:47,223 --> 00:58:50,124
- Is Mr. Arun home?
- Yes, he is. Come in.

571
00:58:59,335 --> 00:59:02,463
- The reverend priest is here.
- Ask him to have a seat.

572
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:05,700
- I did.
- And tell him I'll be right there.

573
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,187
Your Holiness.

574
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:21,257
Why did you take the trouble?
You could have sent for me.

575
00:59:21,357 --> 00:59:24,986
It's no trouble at all.
I was passing by.

576
00:59:25,094 --> 00:59:27,790
I thought it'd be a good chance
to see the blessed child.

577
00:59:28,765 --> 00:59:32,565
Lakshmi!
His Holiness is here to see Maya.

578
00:59:36,606 --> 00:59:38,267
Would you like something?

579
00:59:39,542 --> 00:59:40,509
Tea?

580
00:59:41,377 --> 00:59:43,174
Milk? It's your first visit.

581
00:59:43,279 --> 00:59:44,906
It's quite all right.

582
00:59:54,524 --> 00:59:56,355
Well, well...

583
00:59:56,526 --> 00:59:59,757
so this is the girl?
Come, my child.

584
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:05,131
Such a wonderful child.

585
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:09,037
So beautiful.

586
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:13,564
You’re very lucky, my child.

587
01:00:13,676 --> 01:00:17,271
The village is already
talking about the feast.

588
01:00:19,515 --> 01:00:21,346
It'll be an event to remember.

589
01:00:24,253 --> 01:00:25,550
Is that Sanjay?

590
01:00:25,655 --> 01:00:27,646
Come here, son.

591
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:29,715
Come on.

592
01:00:29,826 --> 01:00:31,453
Come on!

593
01:00:34,764 --> 01:00:36,231
Come back!

594
01:00:39,268 --> 01:00:41,566
I'm sorry about
Sanjay's behavior.

595
01:00:41,671 --> 01:00:45,835
He's still new to the place,
and he's a little shy.

596
01:01:41,831 --> 01:01:43,628
Sanjay!

597
01:01:46,335 --> 01:01:48,200
Listen to me.

598
01:01:51,741 --> 01:01:54,710
I've been looking all over for you.
Where did you go?

599
01:01:55,445 --> 01:01:57,845
Your father is hopping mad.

600
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:03,652
His Holiness is so respected
in the village, and what do you do?

601
01:02:03,753 --> 01:02:09,020
What was the need for that?
We called you but you ran away.

602
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:10,692
Greetings, sir.

603
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:22,428
Vivek, we should invite Shashi,
Naidu and Subaya personally.

604
01:02:22,538 --> 01:02:25,302
- Let's not overlook anyone.
- I've checked the guest list.

605
01:02:25,608 --> 01:02:27,235
Let me check it again.

606
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,775
Where did you run off to?

607
01:02:33,816 --> 01:02:37,274
How many times do I have to tell you
to behave yourself?

608
01:02:37,386 --> 01:02:39,217
Do you know who His Holiness is?

609
01:02:39,622 --> 01:02:43,217
He is a reincarnation of God!
He was so nice to you

610
01:02:43,326 --> 01:02:45,055
and you insulted him!

611
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:49,463
Get up!

612
01:02:50,032 --> 01:02:52,262
When will you learn?

613
01:02:52,368 --> 01:02:53,665
When?

614
01:02:54,203 --> 01:02:55,795
You're an embarrassment!

615
01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:58,669
When will you learn?

616
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:02,642
Now get out of my sight!

617
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:43,577
What was the need for that?

618
01:03:44,287 --> 01:03:46,619
Why don’t you listen
to your father?

619
01:03:46,722 --> 01:03:47,746
Mommy,

620
01:03:47,857 --> 01:03:49,484
I don't like His Holiness.

621
01:03:49,592 --> 01:03:51,583
Shut up!
He's a very good man.

622
01:03:51,694 --> 01:03:54,254
You behaved so badly,

623
01:03:54,363 --> 01:03:56,888
and yet he was so forgiving.

624
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:58,398
He's a great man.

625
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:00,731
- What is to be made for dinner?
- Ask Mridu.

626
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:02,532
She instructed me to ask you.

627
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:06,174
Make a potato curry
and rice pudding.

628
01:04:06,709 --> 01:04:09,610
Make extra pudding.
We'll send it to His Holiness.

629
01:04:09,712 --> 01:04:12,237
Wait. I'll be right there.

630
01:04:13,115 --> 01:04:14,309
Maya, come with me.

631
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:16,885
And you,
don’t just sit there in a sulk.

632
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:47,849
Tea.

633
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:49,851
Mommy, the porridge is great.

634
01:04:49,952 --> 01:04:51,920
Yeah. Finish it.

635
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:03,691
- Just one each.
- Yes.

636
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:08,863
Take this.

637
01:05:16,512 --> 01:05:20,004
Sanjay! You want a thrashing
early in the morning?

638
01:05:20,116 --> 01:05:21,743
Come on!

639
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:51,470
Can Maya come out to play?

640
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:55,817
Okay.

641
01:05:58,988 --> 01:06:00,615
No fighting!

642
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:35,380
The last time I was here, the snake
was trying to eat the birds' eggs.

643
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:37,391
But I saved them.

644
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:40,519
- Where were the birds?
- How would I know?

645
01:06:40,629 --> 01:06:45,089
- But...
- Be quiet or the snake will hear us.

646
01:06:47,203 --> 01:06:50,070
Snakes love birds' eggs.

647
01:06:50,773 --> 01:06:52,240
Do you like it here?

648
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:55,640
Yeah, but it would be more fun
if we saw the snake.

649
01:06:55,745 --> 01:06:57,372
I mean here in the village.

650
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:58,947
It's all right.

651
01:06:59,982 --> 01:07:04,783
I can’t wait for the feast
to be over so we can go home.

652
01:07:04,887 --> 01:07:09,347
After the feast,
we'll eat and play a lot.

653
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:11,756
But I may not be able
to play with you.

654
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:14,227
Everyone says I've grown up

655
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:16,628
and must help Mommy.

656
01:07:16,732 --> 01:07:19,223
So what?
Try and get away for a while.

657
01:07:19,335 --> 01:07:21,326
We'll play such a prank,

658
01:07:21,437 --> 01:07:23,667
His Holiness
will never forget the feast.

659
01:07:26,075 --> 01:07:27,872
You scared her.

660
01:07:27,977 --> 01:07:29,308
And you?

661
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:33,876
So have you seen
the snake since?

662
01:07:33,983 --> 01:07:35,610
When I came here with Sanjay,

663
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:37,845
it got so close
it slid over our feet.

664
01:07:38,821 --> 01:07:40,686
Does she always lie like this?

665
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:43,088
No, it's true.

666
01:07:43,192 --> 01:07:44,819
We ran to save our lives.

667
01:07:44,927 --> 01:07:49,762
And the last time I was here,
I saved some birds' eggs from the snake.

668
01:07:51,767 --> 01:07:55,897
Be quiet or it might hear us.

669
01:07:58,941 --> 01:08:01,910
- How long have you been here?
- Quite a while.

670
01:08:02,778 --> 01:08:04,575
Let's not waste time.

671
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:07,248
Come on. You and I can play
cops and robbers.

672
01:08:08,017 --> 01:08:09,484
Let's go.

673
01:08:23,699 --> 01:08:25,326
Why did you run away?

674
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:29,461
- You ran, not me.
- We were playing cops and robbers.

675
01:08:29,572 --> 01:08:32,370
- Can't I play too?
- It's not for girls.

676
01:08:32,475 --> 01:08:36,605
- Then I won't play with you.
- Fine. We'll play bandits.

677
01:08:36,712 --> 01:08:38,680
- I won't be a bandit.
- Why not?

678
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:42,410
Phoolan Devi was a bandit.
You can be the Bandit Queen!

679
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:45,246
There. Happy?

680
01:08:49,258 --> 01:08:52,284
That was fun.
But we won't play that next time.

681
01:08:52,394 --> 01:08:53,656
Then what?

682
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:55,794
Hide-and-seek.

683
01:08:56,065 --> 01:08:59,501
We'll play in the tall grass.
It's easier to hide.

684
01:08:59,602 --> 01:09:01,263
We'll have a lot of fun.

685
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:04,498
This is your place.
See you later.

686
01:09:04,607 --> 01:09:07,235
Take care of your sister.

687
01:09:07,343 --> 01:09:10,141
I'll marry her when we grow up.

688
01:09:10,246 --> 01:09:14,376
It's too late.
I've grown-up and you're still a kid.

689
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:17,782
Don't speak to your future husband
like that.

690
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:23,220
I'm warning you.
You keep away from her!

691
01:09:23,325 --> 01:09:25,793
Or else what?

692
01:09:30,499 --> 01:09:32,967
Break it up!

693
01:09:33,068 --> 01:09:37,027
At this rate, you'll be in jail
before you can grow a mustache!

694
01:09:37,573 --> 01:09:39,040
Get inside, Sanjay.

695
01:10:14,543 --> 01:10:18,138
Enough! Come on!

696
01:10:18,247 --> 01:10:22,445
What's going on?
Come on!

697
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:24,382
Come out, the three of you!

698
01:10:24,486 --> 01:10:26,818
Inside, everyone!
You hear me?

699
01:10:26,922 --> 01:10:28,651
You want to get sick?

700
01:10:28,757 --> 01:10:30,622
Guri, take this inside.

701
01:10:30,926 --> 01:10:32,154
Go inside.

702
01:10:33,028 --> 01:10:36,395
Here. Inside now.

703
01:10:41,036 --> 01:10:43,061
Guri, enough!

704
01:10:43,606 --> 01:10:45,471
You've all become barbarians.

705
01:10:46,175 --> 01:10:48,405
And this girl, too!

706
01:10:48,944 --> 01:10:51,412
Didn't I tell you to stop
fooling around starting today?

707
01:10:52,114 --> 01:10:54,548
The feast's tomorrow
and she's still acting like a child.

708
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:56,117
What kind of ceremony?

709
01:10:57,653 --> 01:10:59,985
To celebrate that she has grown up.

710
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:02,853
I'm grown-up too. Pray to me.

711
01:11:03,959 --> 01:11:05,426
This is only for girls.

712
01:11:05,527 --> 01:11:06,994
No! Pray to me!

713
01:11:10,032 --> 01:11:14,935
Guri! Stop troubling your mother.
Sanjay, go out and play.

714
01:11:15,604 --> 01:11:17,333
She's not going with you.

715
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:19,907
- Why?
- Because I said so.

716
01:11:20,009 --> 01:11:22,136
- I won't go.
- You want to be smacked?

717
01:11:22,244 --> 01:11:24,041
Sanjay, take your brother with you.

718
01:11:26,415 --> 01:11:27,541
I won't go!

719
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:32,981
Stop tugging on him!
Be careful!

720
01:11:35,758 --> 01:11:39,558
Come on!
I have a lion waiting to eat you!

721
01:11:44,099 --> 01:11:45,726
Try this one on.

722
01:12:03,485 --> 01:12:04,952
Looks good.

723
01:12:05,054 --> 01:12:06,521
Yes, it does.

724
01:12:07,222 --> 01:12:09,190
Maya, try this one.

725
01:12:23,405 --> 01:12:24,702
Perfect.

726
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:34,069
Here, go and give these sweets
to His Holiness.

727
01:13:34,176 --> 01:13:37,304
- I want more.
- What's that in your hand?

728
01:14:05,941 --> 01:14:06,908
Raju.

729
01:14:20,355 --> 01:14:24,485
What's the big deal?
I killed a huge scorpion the other day.

730
01:14:24,593 --> 01:14:28,393
Don't lie.
If a scorpion stings you, you're dead.

731
01:14:28,497 --> 01:14:29,623
Have you killed one?

732
01:14:29,731 --> 01:14:31,824
No, but I don't lie about it.

733
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:02,794
What a pleasant surprise...

734
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:07,761
You! How dare you come
into my house!

735
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:09,497
How dare you!

736
01:15:22,050 --> 01:15:23,881
Now, don't be scared.

737
01:15:25,153 --> 01:15:26,780
There's nothing to be afraid of.

738
01:15:27,322 --> 01:15:30,621
What are nice kids like you
doing with that devil's pup?

739
01:15:32,828 --> 01:15:34,796
He's bad company.

740
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:40,232
So how can I help you?

741
01:15:41,436 --> 01:15:43,165
What is this?

742
01:15:44,873 --> 01:15:45,999
Sweets.

743
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:49,909
My stomach's good too.

744
01:15:52,781 --> 01:15:54,578
Such a caring family.

745
01:15:55,851 --> 01:15:59,082
Just watch. Your prayer ceremony
will be the best.

746
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:03,555
All right, children.
You must excuse me.

747
01:16:03,759 --> 01:16:06,785
Come.

748
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:31,742
Ganesh, get the curry.

749
01:16:32,621 --> 01:16:35,249
Maya, eat.

750
01:16:35,457 --> 01:16:38,085
Yes, honey. Eat your fill.

751
01:16:38,193 --> 01:16:40,491
Tomorrow you can only eat
after the feast.

752
01:16:43,098 --> 01:16:45,032
Do you want some?

753
01:16:45,133 --> 01:16:46,100
Water.

754
01:16:48,704 --> 01:16:52,003
Stop acting like animals!

755
01:16:52,708 --> 01:16:55,768
Look at your sister,
eating so nicely.

756
01:16:55,877 --> 01:16:57,344
Why can’t you be like her?

757
01:16:59,047 --> 01:17:02,346
- Mommy, I'm done.
- Good. Go and change.

758
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:10,720
Guri.

759
01:17:11,426 --> 01:17:13,291
You're a big boy, aren’t you?

760
01:17:14,262 --> 01:17:16,162
Today you’ll sleep
in Daddy's room.

761
01:17:17,366 --> 01:17:21,496
What do you mean, no?
You'll do what you’re told.

762
01:17:22,704 --> 01:17:24,331
Curry anyone?

763
01:18:06,348 --> 01:18:07,815
Hurry up!

764
01:18:53,929 --> 01:18:57,626
Welcome. Please come in.

765
01:22:37,519 --> 01:22:39,487
Open the door!
Open the door!

766
01:22:43,858 --> 01:22:45,985
What are you doing?

767
01:22:46,094 --> 01:22:47,561
Maya is fine.

768
01:22:48,096 --> 01:22:50,223
Go and play elsewhere!

769
01:22:53,001 --> 01:22:54,832
Arun!

770
01:22:55,203 --> 01:22:58,001
Open the door!

771
01:22:59,874 --> 01:23:01,432
What's wrong with you?

772
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:04,172
How many times
must I tell you to behave?

773
01:23:04,279 --> 01:23:07,578
Don't embarrass the family
in front of the guests!

774
01:23:07,682 --> 01:23:11,049
- What's wrong with you?
- Enough! Don't kill him!

775
01:23:11,152 --> 01:23:13,450
- Open the door!
- Please understand.

776
01:23:13,555 --> 01:23:16,251
It's a very important day for Maya.
You can't be with her.

777
01:23:16,358 --> 01:23:18,519
Go to Aunty Mridu.

778
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:21,895
Must you make a show?

779
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:23,624
Did you see what he did?

780
01:23:24,566 --> 01:23:26,761
And beating him
is good for our dignity?

781
01:23:26,868 --> 01:23:28,859
Defend the brat!
Spoil him rotten!

782
01:23:28,970 --> 01:23:30,597
Please don't shout!

783
01:23:33,975 --> 01:23:35,272
Do you like the food?

784
01:26:09,697 --> 01:26:11,528
Eat, eat!

785
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:27,504
Open the door!

786
01:26:31,219 --> 01:26:32,686
Stop it!

787
01:26:32,787 --> 01:26:35,415
- Don't embarrass everyone!
- Open the door!

788
01:26:35,523 --> 01:26:37,991
Come with me
before Daddy spanks you.

789
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:21,425
God has been very kind.

790
01:27:22,136 --> 01:27:24,434
Bless her.
I think she needs some rest.

791
01:27:25,473 --> 01:27:27,839
This way, please.

792
01:27:44,892 --> 01:27:47,360
Ganesh, heat some water
for her bath.

793
01:28:36,577 --> 01:28:38,204
Please, you must.

794
01:28:41,249 --> 01:28:42,716
I must say one thing.

795
01:28:44,018 --> 01:28:47,613
I've never conducted a prayer
ceremony as blessed as this one.

796
01:28:48,990 --> 01:28:51,481
Good food, good ceremony.

797
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:54,055
Maya is a pure soul,

798
01:28:54,762 --> 01:28:57,060
and God loves her.

799
01:28:57,665 --> 01:28:59,758
She will always be happy.

800
01:29:01,302 --> 01:29:02,929
God bless you.

801
01:29:07,775 --> 01:29:09,572
It's okay, love.

802
01:29:15,149 --> 01:29:16,912
It's all over now.

803
01:29:17,618 --> 01:29:19,518
Everything will be fine.

804
01:29:40,241 --> 01:29:43,039
You want to eat
from your sister's plate?

805
01:29:44,812 --> 01:29:46,439
Off you go.

806
01:29:54,155 --> 01:29:55,679
How is Maya?

807
01:29:56,057 --> 01:29:57,684
She's a little tired,

808
01:29:57,792 --> 01:29:59,419
but she's okay.

809
01:29:59,527 --> 01:30:02,587
- I hope everything went well?
- Oh, yes.

810
01:30:02,930 --> 01:30:06,161
His Holiness said our prayer
ceremony was truly blessed.

811
01:30:07,335 --> 01:30:09,496
He was all praises for Maya.

812
01:30:09,604 --> 01:30:13,540
He said she's truly blessed
and God really loves her.

813
01:30:13,641 --> 01:30:15,370
God bless us all.

814
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:17,810
I'm glad it went well.

815
01:30:17,912 --> 01:30:19,402
Maya, eat.

816
01:30:20,615 --> 01:30:21,582
Here, Sanjay.

817
01:30:24,585 --> 01:30:26,052
Let him be!

818
01:30:28,322 --> 01:30:29,949
What's with him?

819
01:30:54,949 --> 01:30:57,543
Rahim, sir!
All your goats are loose.

820
01:30:57,652 --> 01:30:59,552
They're heading for the jungle!

821
01:31:08,129 --> 01:31:10,427
Who the...
Who? What?

822
01:31:15,770 --> 01:31:19,035
Stop it, you motherfuckers!
Take this to your homes, little fucks!

823
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:21,240
Defiling a priest's home!

824
01:31:21,843 --> 01:31:23,811
Motherfucking sons of bitches!

825
01:31:25,947 --> 01:31:27,744
Destroying my home!

826
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:45,561
Now the priest will really hate you.

827
01:31:45,666 --> 01:31:47,031
Who cares?

828
01:31:47,134 --> 01:31:49,602
Won’t you get a thrashing at home?

829
01:31:49,704 --> 01:31:51,069
No way.

830
01:31:51,239 --> 01:31:54,003
My old man's a drunk,

831
01:31:54,108 --> 01:31:56,201
so I can do as I please.

832
01:31:56,310 --> 01:31:59,370
But why does the priest
hate you so much?

833
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:01,607
I killed his goat

834
01:32:01,716 --> 01:32:06,449
after he performed the same
prayer ceremony for my sister.

835
01:32:06,554 --> 01:32:11,355
Why didn’t you tell us that Maya
would get hurt at the prayer ceremony?

836
01:32:11,459 --> 01:32:13,256
Because it's pointless.

837
01:32:13,461 --> 01:32:15,486
The elders do what they want,

838
01:32:15,696 --> 01:32:18,494
and if you say anything,
you get thrashed.

839
01:32:18,599 --> 01:32:20,897
I saved you a beating.

840
01:32:21,002 --> 01:32:22,799
We could have run away.

841
01:32:22,904 --> 01:32:24,599
Where would you run to?

842
01:32:25,806 --> 01:32:29,765
Besides, why are you always
talking about running away?

843
01:32:30,645 --> 01:32:31,976
Come on.

844
01:32:45,726 --> 01:32:47,353
What did you do?

845
01:32:49,196 --> 01:32:51,255
You've become worse
than an animal!

846
01:32:51,365 --> 01:32:54,596
The ceremony was so blessed!
His Holiness was so happy!

847
01:32:55,369 --> 01:32:58,270
You had to ruin everything!
You've ruined it!

848
01:33:00,041 --> 01:33:03,408
You've ruined it!
What did you throw at the priest?

849
01:33:03,511 --> 01:33:06,571
You've ruined it!
I've lost face!

850
01:33:07,448 --> 01:33:09,575
You've ruined everything!

851
01:33:09,717 --> 01:33:12,413
I'm ashamed to say
you are my son!

852
01:33:12,887 --> 01:33:15,151
What did you throw
at His Holiness?

853
01:33:15,256 --> 01:33:18,851
Tell me what!
Tell me why!

854
01:33:28,135 --> 01:33:29,602
Please stop!

855
01:33:30,137 --> 01:33:31,798
Look at the gall!

856
01:33:31,906 --> 01:33:34,534
Get out of my sight!

857
01:34:01,602 --> 01:34:04,070
I got the priest nice and proper.

858
01:34:07,008 --> 01:34:08,703
When we threw meat at him,

859
01:34:08,809 --> 01:34:12,267
he screamed
as if he'd lost his father.

860
01:34:47,014 --> 01:34:51,781
Eat your food. I don't want to
hear a squeak out of you!

861
01:34:51,886 --> 01:34:53,410
- Please.
- Shut up!

862
01:34:53,521 --> 01:34:54,988
You've spoiled him!

863
01:34:55,089 --> 01:34:58,855
We've lost our dignity
because of this animal!

864
01:34:58,959 --> 01:35:02,895
- Enough!
- Go ahead, spoil him!

865
01:35:03,698 --> 01:35:07,259
I'd thought we’d stay together
for a few days.

866
01:35:07,368 --> 01:35:11,600
But thanks to you, the three of us
have to run away tomorrow!

867
01:35:16,043 --> 01:35:17,670
Maya is staying here

868
01:35:17,778 --> 01:35:19,905
so that she doesn't become like you.

869
01:35:21,782 --> 01:35:23,579
This is Maya's real home.

870
01:35:24,285 --> 01:35:28,085
She's grown up now
and will stay with her mother.

871
01:35:28,422 --> 01:35:29,480
Eat.

872
01:35:32,727 --> 01:35:34,627
Eat, honey.

873
01:35:45,573 --> 01:35:48,508
Maya, why aren’t you eating?

874
01:35:48,876 --> 01:35:51,504
You haven't eaten all day.
You must be hungry.

875
01:35:51,612 --> 01:35:54,410
- Would you like some porridge?
- I'd like some.

876
01:35:54,515 --> 01:35:55,982
Shut up.

877
01:35:56,250 --> 01:35:57,842
Maya, what's wrong?

878
01:35:58,152 --> 01:36:00,552
Your food is getting cold.

879
01:36:01,055 --> 01:36:02,079
Eat.

880
01:36:04,091 --> 01:36:05,820
Eat something.

881
01:36:06,527 --> 01:36:08,154
Would you like something else?

882
01:36:09,430 --> 01:36:10,897
Maya, honey.

883
01:36:29,183 --> 01:36:35,645
After we leave, apologize to
His Holiness on our behalf.

884
01:36:35,756 --> 01:36:38,987
Sanjay, come on, wake up.
We have to leave shortly.

885
01:36:39,860 --> 01:36:44,263
I hope His Holiness is not
mad at us.

886
01:36:44,365 --> 01:36:46,390
It wouldn't be good.

887
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:50,334
And take care of Maya.
She seems really quiet.

888
01:36:52,540 --> 01:36:55,668
She'll get used to the place
in a few days.

889
01:36:59,046 --> 01:37:01,981
That's true.
But we'll miss her a lot.

890
01:37:07,388 --> 01:37:11,256
Thank you so much for everything.
If it weren't for you...

891
01:37:12,026 --> 01:37:15,655
Stop with that.
She's also my daughter.

892
01:37:16,363 --> 01:37:21,494
I'd have done the same,
had she been my blood. It's our duty.

893
01:37:31,879 --> 01:37:33,642
Let's run away.

894
01:37:34,682 --> 01:37:39,051
Please listen to your parents
for a change!

895
01:37:39,153 --> 01:37:41,178
Get out of here.
Let her be.

896
01:37:42,189 --> 01:37:44,987
You'll get another beating,
and Maya too.

897
01:37:45,092 --> 01:37:47,185
Go on.

898
01:37:47,294 --> 01:37:48,556
Get out!

899
01:38:04,545 --> 01:38:07,912
Vivek, if you need anything,
let me know.

900
01:38:08,015 --> 01:38:11,849
Take your medication on time.
I'll come when you need me.

901
01:38:14,722 --> 01:38:17,691
Sanjay, say your good-byes
and get in the car.

902
01:38:20,728 --> 01:38:22,958
Maya, honey, good-bye.

903
01:38:27,434 --> 01:38:28,765
Take care of yourself.

904
01:38:31,672 --> 01:38:34,402
Don't worry.
She'll be fine in a few days.

905
01:38:35,743 --> 01:38:38,541
Come get in the car.

906
01:38:43,417 --> 01:38:45,385
This too shall pass.

907
01:39:56,490 --> 01:39:57,957
What happened?

908
01:40:01,395 --> 01:40:02,862
It's a lizard!
