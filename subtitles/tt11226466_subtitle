Where is JD? Where is JD? 
Where is JD?

178
00:13:11,887 --> 00:13:12,771
Are you teasing?

179
00:13:12,812 --> 00:13:14,729
I'm standing here, 
can't you see?

180
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:15,562
Where is Jai?

181
00:13:15,604 --> 00:13:17,604
He would've just got up 
from bed.

182
00:13:17,646 --> 00:13:21,604
So, I'm a fool getting up at 7 
o'clock and coming to office.

183
00:13:21,646 --> 00:13:24,145
Priya, why are you waking 
him up at 7?

184
00:13:24,187 --> 00:13:25,112
I'm not waking him up.

185
00:13:25,312 --> 00:13:26,812
He gets coffee and wakes me up.

186
00:13:26,854 --> 00:13:27,562
Oh!

187
00:13:27,604 --> 00:13:30,479
Hey wife, family secrets shoud 
be confined to the house.

188
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:31,562
Not to reveal here.

189
00:13:31,604 --> 00:13:33,087
-Okay, dear husband. 
-What okay?

190
00:13:33,287 --> 00:13:34,771
Tell Jai to meet me 
in the cabin.

191
00:13:34,812 --> 00:13:35,562
Okay.

192
00:13:35,604 --> 00:13:36,520
What are you looking here?

193
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,937
Am I dancing?

194
00:13:37,979 --> 00:13:39,354
Shouldn't be born beautiful.

195
00:13:39,554 --> 00:13:40,354
-Stupid. 
-Oh, no!

196
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:41,395
Look his head.

197
00:13:57,687 --> 00:13:58,608
-Hi! 
-Hi.

198
00:13:58,808 --> 00:13:59,729
Hi, darling.

199
00:14:03,729 --> 00:14:05,145
Hey, what are you doing?

200
00:14:05,937 --> 00:14:08,270
Hey, it seems you crossed 
the limits, last night.

201
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,937
You called and proposed me.

202
00:14:10,646 --> 00:14:12,479
Did I propose?

203
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:13,270
Get lost!

204
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:16,021
You were with me, right? 
Tell him.

205
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,737
-Actually... 
-Are you asking him?

206
00:14:17,937 --> 00:14:21,145
Inebriated, he asked his 
house address to me, once.

207
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:23,354
You asked the other thing, when high.

208
00:14:23,604 --> 00:14:24,487
Do you remember?

209
00:14:24,687 --> 00:14:26,941
He would've asked for 
snacks and chips.

210
00:14:27,141 --> 00:14:29,395
-Priya, not chips...but kiss. 
-Kiss!

211
00:14:29,937 --> 00:14:31,771
Hey, did I ask a kiss?

212
00:14:31,812 --> 00:14:33,312
Why are you telling lies?

213
00:14:33,812 --> 00:14:35,737
Yes, you must ask in person 
if you are man enough.

214
00:14:35,937 --> 00:14:38,312
-Instead, you asked on the phone? 
-What? If I'm man enough?

215
00:14:38,512 --> 00:14:41,104
If you have such a doubt, 
ask my darling.

216
00:14:42,812 --> 00:14:44,021
Are you him?

217
00:14:45,021 --> 00:14:46,354
I'll give.

218
00:14:46,395 --> 00:14:47,312
Let me see.

219
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:49,562
-I'll give. 
-Give me.

220
00:14:49,896 --> 00:14:51,270
What's happening here?

221
00:14:51,479 --> 00:14:53,557
-I'll give. 
-Give me, let me see.

222
00:14:57,937 --> 00:14:59,687
-ID card. 
-Damn it.

223
00:14:59,937 --> 00:15:01,320
I know I asked this.

224
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,021
I asked you to come 
to my cabin.

225
00:15:03,063 --> 00:15:03,812
Why didn't you come?

226
00:15:03,854 --> 00:15:05,295
No one has told me.

227
00:15:05,495 --> 00:15:06,737
Didn't you tell him?

228
00:15:06,937 --> 00:15:08,729
A romantic scene was going on. 
I thought of telling after it gets over.

229
00:15:08,929 --> 00:15:11,021
Better to say after getting married 
and giving birth to child.

230
00:15:11,221 --> 00:15:12,937
Yeah, I'll do that next time. 
very good notion.

231
00:15:13,137 --> 00:15:15,021
You'll be paralysed 
before you go home.

232
00:15:15,354 --> 00:15:18,562
The reports are submitted by 
everyone in the office except us.

233
00:15:18,604 --> 00:15:20,562
-Who told we didn't do? 
-I'm telling you.

234
00:15:20,604 --> 00:15:22,562
-We've submitted it last evening. 
-Why didn't you tell me?

235
00:15:22,604 --> 00:15:23,279
I've sent an email.

236
00:15:23,479 --> 00:15:24,896
Why didn't you tell, 
an email has been sent?

237
00:15:25,096 --> 00:15:25,937
I messaged you in WhatsApp.

238
00:15:25,979 --> 00:15:28,187
Oh, no! Why didn't you tell, 
you had sent a message?

239
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:31,270
I'll download and tell you, 
if any new App is created.

240
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:34,145
This company owner is from Las Vegas...

241
00:15:34,187 --> 00:15:35,896
...He has opened a bar 
for your convenience.

242
00:15:36,096 --> 00:15:37,354
You booze there and blabber here.

243
00:15:37,554 --> 00:15:38,812
Okay, why are you getting tensed?

244
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,520
-Come, let's have a cold beer. 
-Be quiet.

245
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,395
Look here, I'm your team leader.

246
00:15:42,437 --> 00:15:43,529
You must all respect me.

247
00:15:43,729 --> 00:15:46,270
[in unison] Good morning, JD!

248
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:47,570
Oh no!

249
00:15:48,395 --> 00:15:50,608
I'm managing all these people 
like the pilgrims in Tirupathi!

250
00:15:50,808 --> 00:15:53,021
What's this, weeping like a child?

251
00:15:53,221 --> 00:15:53,529
Calm down.

252
00:15:53,729 --> 00:15:55,812
I feel like weeping more, 
when I see you.

253
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:57,021
Go to your seat.

254
00:15:57,221 --> 00:15:57,487
Go...

255
00:15:57,687 --> 00:15:58,395
Come home, I'll see to you.

256
00:15:58,437 --> 00:15:59,487
What are you doing?

257
00:15:59,687 --> 00:16:01,479
-I'm switching on. 
-What's that you're switching on?

258
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:03,270
It's clear you're watching movie.

259
00:16:32,063 --> 00:16:33,604
It's not cool, brother.

260
00:16:48,354 --> 00:16:48,904
Fabulous!

261
00:16:49,104 --> 00:16:50,896
Do you know the value 
of a beer?

262
00:16:51,096 --> 00:16:52,104
Thank you!

263
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,104
Oh, no!

264
00:17:22,187 --> 00:17:26,395
You didn't give me your 
contact number and fled, isn't it?

265
00:17:26,595 --> 00:17:28,604
I thought of giving 
my contact number.

266
00:17:28,804 --> 00:17:30,312
But, we reached trichy by then.

267
00:17:30,354 --> 00:17:33,104
If I wake you up, 
something might happen again.

268
00:17:33,304 --> 00:17:34,104
That's why, I left.

269
00:17:35,646 --> 00:17:36,812
Yeah, what's your name?

270
00:17:37,228 --> 00:17:38,696
You're a big fraud.

271
00:17:38,896 --> 00:17:40,395
You've planned everything.

272
00:17:40,437 --> 00:17:42,462
How can I do by planning it?

273
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:44,487
I took a ticket to Trichy.

274
00:17:44,687 --> 00:17:47,191
Can I plan expecting a girl 
will travel alone in the train...

275
00:17:47,391 --> 00:17:49,896
...can accompany her to booze 
and after sloshing I can kiss.

276
00:17:50,096 --> 00:17:52,104
Even now, we met unexpectedly. 
Like that...

277
00:17:52,395 --> 00:17:53,687
Okay, leave it.

278
00:17:53,854 --> 00:17:55,187
Where are you staying?

279
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,395
In a flat at OMR.

280
00:17:58,104 --> 00:18:00,604
-Are you staying alone? 
-Yes, staying alone for two years.

281
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,187
What about your food?

282
00:18:03,729 --> 00:18:04,604
Why?

283
00:18:04,937 --> 00:18:06,733
I'm working in Deltec, 
as an Associate.

284
00:18:06,933 --> 00:18:08,729
Earning one and half lakh rupees montly.

285
00:18:08,929 --> 00:18:10,395
No problem for food.

286
00:18:10,437 --> 00:18:12,812
Once in two days, 
I'll eat mutton biryani.

287
00:18:12,854 --> 00:18:15,729
Why are you laughing? 
Is it like I'm telling lie?

288
00:18:16,312 --> 00:18:19,104
I asked about the cooking.

289
00:18:19,729 --> 00:18:21,896
But, you're saying about 
the salary.

290
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,524
I thought of something...

291
00:18:26,724 --> 00:18:28,520
You're still the same, huh?

292
00:18:29,228 --> 00:18:30,270
Always...

293
00:18:31,979 --> 00:18:35,604
Any intention of getting married 
or going to roam train by train?

294
00:18:35,804 --> 00:18:37,195
Hello, how do I look like?

295
00:18:37,395 --> 00:18:40,896
I don't have any intention but my 
parents are looking for a girl.

296
00:18:41,604 --> 00:18:43,696
But, all the girls are grumpy.

297
00:18:43,896 --> 00:18:46,520
I can't see any girl like you 
who is cheerful.

298
00:18:47,228 --> 00:18:48,104
What about you?

299
00:18:49,063 --> 00:18:50,312
I'm looking too.

300
00:18:50,646 --> 00:18:52,395
Oh! Super.

301
00:18:57,312 --> 00:18:58,687
-Shall we get married? 
-Shall we get married?

302
00:19:17,687 --> 00:19:21,604
I, Albert Jai will take you, 
Genelia as my wife and hold...

303
00:19:21,646 --> 00:19:26,187
...for better, for worse,in sickness 
and in health...

304
00:19:26,387 --> 00:19:27,312
Father!

305
00:19:27,896 --> 00:19:30,479
With much efforts, I've 
convinced her for marriage.

306
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:33,479
But, you're taking credit.

307
00:19:34,771 --> 00:19:36,104
Even he is teasing the priest.

308
00:19:36,145 --> 00:19:37,529
You repeat that.

309
00:19:37,729 --> 00:19:41,479
Me? Father, I'll take care of her 
till my end, like my own life.

310
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:41,821
Enough?

311
00:19:42,021 --> 00:19:46,270
I vowed penance 
and did sacred rituals,

312
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,312
And named him as "Vijayavel".

313
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:51,312
He had erased half 
of his name.

314
00:19:51,354 --> 00:19:52,979
Albert.

315
00:19:58,187 --> 00:20:00,729
Congratulations and my sympathies!

316
00:20:18,562 --> 00:20:21,104
Both of you can share your love.

317
00:20:25,854 --> 00:20:28,395
May lord bless you both.

318
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,146
Your room!Your balcony! 
You've good taste.

319
00:20:41,883 --> 00:20:43,658
I purchased this flat for this bedroom.

320
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:45,727
Come.

321
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,142
It's our first night, right?

322
00:20:54,434 --> 00:20:57,101
No, it's second night.

323
00:21:32,695 --> 00:21:35,180
Hey, do you've anything 
for safety?

324
00:21:36,154 --> 00:21:37,245
For safety?

325
00:21:37,445 --> 00:21:38,768
That is, gloves...

326
00:21:39,146 --> 00:21:40,280
Gloves?

327
00:21:40,597 --> 00:21:42,192
Are we going to do boxing?

328
00:21:42,392 --> 00:21:43,618
We got married.

329
00:21:47,525 --> 00:21:51,606
Should I get conceived next month 
and lose my life because I got married?

330
00:21:51,806 --> 00:21:52,813
What are you saying?

331
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:58,559
Everyone falls in love 
and get married.

332
00:21:59,018 --> 00:22:02,101
Suddenly, we met each other 
and got married.

333
00:22:02,769 --> 00:22:05,545
I want at least five years to love you.

334
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,513
...and enjoy life with you.

335
00:22:08,701 --> 00:22:11,962
Wouldn't the life will be better, 
if we've a baby after that?

336
00:22:12,162 --> 00:22:13,777
A baby after five years?

337
00:22:14,392 --> 00:22:16,726
What will you do if the vehicle 
isn't good after five years?

338
00:22:17,368 --> 00:22:18,643
Can we change the spare parts?

339
00:22:18,973 --> 00:22:20,070
But, I can change the vehicle.

340
00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:21,768
Oh, traitor!

341
00:22:22,353 --> 00:22:24,516
Okay, let's use the gloves 
and do boxing from tomorrow.

342
00:22:24,716 --> 00:22:26,308
-Adjust, today. 
-No...

343
00:22:27,318 --> 00:22:28,900
The match will not happen 
without gloves.

344
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,655
-Good night. 
-Good night?

345
00:22:30,855 --> 00:22:32,658
Hey, don't sleep. 
Just wait for ten minutes.

346
00:22:32,858 --> 00:22:34,740
My phone... oh no!

347
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,868
Venky, an important help...

348
00:22:44,068 --> 00:22:45,834
Tell me, darling. 
How many wickets?

349
00:22:46,034 --> 00:22:47,975
The match is yet to start. 
She is asking for gloves.

350
00:22:48,175 --> 00:22:49,570
Gloves! You got married!

351
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:51,768
She is teaching me as five years 
and ten years for saying that.

352
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,735
You'll be having in bunches, right?

353
00:22:53,935 --> 00:22:54,902
Bring me.

354
00:22:55,102 --> 00:22:55,359
I can give.

355
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:59,143
But, after more efforts for a week, 
I made Kavitha to fall in trap.

356
00:22:59,343 --> 00:23:00,726
-You can proceed later.-Sorry dude.

357
00:23:00,926 --> 00:23:02,309
-Please, bring them.-Sorry dude.

358
00:23:02,509 --> 00:23:03,768
Hello! 
Hey!

359
00:23:10,271 --> 00:23:11,346
The cutomer you're dialing...

360
00:23:11,497 --> 00:23:12,176
Damn it.

361
00:23:16,926 --> 00:23:19,643
Baby, I tried everywhere.

362
00:23:19,683 --> 00:23:21,426
Everyone is busy.

363
00:23:21,935 --> 00:23:25,087
-Shall I buy you ipill in the morning? 
-Ipill?

364
00:23:25,287 --> 00:23:26,976
Do you know the side effects 
of i-pill?

365
00:23:27,018 --> 00:23:29,185
Inside the uterus...

366
00:23:29,227 --> 00:23:31,976
Please, don't teach me lesson 
in first night.

367
00:23:32,185 --> 00:23:33,480
Give me sometime.

368
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,976
I'll buy, somehow.

369
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:44,434
"He is searching on... 
he is searching on..."

370
00:23:44,634 --> 00:23:46,059
"He is searching on everywhere"

371
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:47,684
"He is searching on keenly..."

372
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,351
"He is getting upset"

373
00:23:49,392 --> 00:23:52,568
"He is yearning at the 
medical stores"

374
00:23:52,768 --> 00:23:55,976
"He is feeling disturbed, 
losing his mood."

375
00:23:58,851 --> 00:24:04,518
"Oh, no! The route is changing on..."

376
00:24:06,185 --> 00:24:07,893
What are you thinking? 
Come on.

377
00:24:10,726 --> 00:24:12,484
Do you've anything for safety?

378
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:14,518
I've all those. Don't be afraid. 
Come.

379
00:24:14,718 --> 00:24:17,726
I want only the safety one.

380
00:24:17,926 --> 00:24:18,901
Only that?

381
00:24:19,101 --> 00:24:21,434
You can't get it. 
Everything comes in combo.

382
00:24:21,634 --> 00:24:22,643
Combo?

383
00:24:23,351 --> 00:24:24,234
How much?

384
00:24:24,434 --> 00:24:26,143
Rs.2000 for an hour.

385
00:24:31,227 --> 00:24:32,185
Take it.

386
00:24:32,227 --> 00:24:35,389
-Okay, come. 
-No, I want only that. I'll take it & go.

387
00:24:39,268 --> 00:24:40,309
Thank you.

388
00:24:40,518 --> 00:24:41,985
Oh, no! Run away.

389
00:24:42,185 --> 00:24:43,476
Why should I run? 
I paid money.

390
00:24:43,676 --> 00:24:45,976
-Hey, stop. 
-Catch him.

391
00:24:46,268 --> 00:24:49,185
-Sir, no... Please... 
-Working in IT firm and celebrating.

392
00:24:49,227 --> 00:24:53,185
-...weekend in search of women at nights. 
-Sir, please...

393
00:24:53,227 --> 00:24:56,143
-I'll hit you, rascal. 
-No, it's painful.

394
00:24:56,343 --> 00:24:57,276
Sir...

395
00:24:57,476 --> 00:24:59,768
Wandering everywhere...

396
00:25:06,476 --> 00:25:08,434
Are you weeping?

397
00:25:08,726 --> 00:25:09,976
Nothing.

398
00:25:12,935 --> 00:25:14,559
Are you weeping?

399
00:25:14,893 --> 00:25:15,768
Nothing.

400
00:25:16,643 --> 00:25:18,684
Stop the bike.

401
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:20,684
Are you laughing?

402
00:25:21,227 --> 00:25:22,318
Why are you laughing?

403
00:25:22,518 --> 00:25:28,185
In first night, getting hit by the police 
and shouting with pain...

404
00:25:28,385 --> 00:25:30,735
Are you teasing me?

405
00:25:30,935 --> 00:25:32,976
-Are you teasing me? 
-Looking superb!

406
00:25:33,018 --> 00:25:34,101
Wait, I'll come.

407
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:59,060
"Didn't expect..."

408
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:03,185
"This moment stands still in my heart"?

409
00:26:03,385 --> 00:26:05,309
"Didn't expect..."

410
00:26:06,268 --> 00:26:09,268
"Somehow, your heart came to me"?

411
00:26:09,468 --> 00:26:11,985
"Didn't expect"

412
00:26:12,185 --> 00:26:15,559
"Both of our shadows are moving 
sticking together"?

413
00:26:15,601 --> 00:26:18,443
"Didn't expect"

414
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:22,351
"When I ask for a kiss, 
your lips are yelling me"

415
00:26:22,551 --> 00:26:23,484
"Didn't expect" 
-Jai!

416
00:26:23,684 --> 00:26:28,684
"I see your face in 
all the directions, I turn"

417
00:26:28,884 --> 00:26:30,559
"My mind broadens whenever 
I desired to"

418
00:26:30,601 --> 00:26:34,935
"There are no words to describe you, 
will you forgive me, beauteous"

419
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:37,185
"Didn't expect..."

420
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:40,976
"This moment stands still in my heart"?

421
00:26:41,018 --> 00:26:43,434
"Didn't expect..."

422
00:26:44,018 --> 00:26:47,351
"Somehow, your heart came to me"?

423
00:26:59,434 --> 00:27:01,143
Feed me. 
I'll eat.

424
00:27:06,392 --> 00:27:08,268
Jenni, did you wore this 
attire, last night?

425
00:27:08,468 --> 00:27:09,068
Get lost.

426
00:27:09,268 --> 00:27:10,726
Then, who would've wore this?

427
00:27:12,392 --> 00:27:17,754
"There are no words to describe you..."

428
00:27:18,589 --> 00:27:23,276
"...will you forgive me, beautiful..."

429
00:27:24,923 --> 00:27:30,471
"You came into my mind without my 
consciousness"

430
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:36,580
"I remained without saying anything."

431
00:27:37,653 --> 00:27:43,500
"I'm a thief who tells lies, meticulously"

432
00:27:43,726 --> 00:27:46,683
"Though you know that,"?

433
00:27:46,883 --> 00:27:50,927
"why did you love me?"

434
00:27:53,227 --> 00:27:56,715
"Didn't expect..."?

435
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,343
"This moment stands still in my heart"

436
00:28:00,543 --> 00:28:02,804
"Didn't expect..."?

437
00:28:03,171 --> 00:28:08,239
"Somehow, your heart came to me"

438
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:11,800
[humming]

439
00:28:15,549 --> 00:28:18,329
[humming]

440
00:28:19,041 --> 00:28:23,564
[singing music notes]

441
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:27,714
[singing music notes continues]

442
00:28:59,060 --> 00:28:59,976
Jenni!

443
00:29:00,643 --> 00:29:02,726
I wish to be like this 
throughout the life.

444
00:29:03,143 --> 00:29:04,185
For me too...

445
00:29:05,309 --> 00:29:07,143
Okay, let past is past.

446
00:29:07,351 --> 00:29:09,518
We both should be true 
to each other.

447
00:29:09,718 --> 00:29:10,518
Okay?

448
00:29:11,684 --> 00:29:13,643
I've given myself wholly to you.

449
00:29:13,843 --> 00:29:15,434
You too give me so.

450
00:29:15,634 --> 00:29:16,643
Take it.

451
00:29:17,185 --> 00:29:19,476
Henceforth, there shouldn't 
be ego between us.

452
00:29:19,684 --> 00:29:22,518
Ok. Andthere should be 
no secrets too.

453
00:29:22,718 --> 00:29:24,559
No, there won't be any secrets.

454
00:29:25,143 --> 00:29:27,976
Whatever work, let's share 
and do it. Okay?

455
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,068
Let's do.

456
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,559
We shouldn't differentiate like 
your's and mine.

457
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:34,351
No, I'll not.

458
00:29:34,512 --> 00:29:35,446
[doorbell rings]

459
00:29:35,976 --> 00:29:37,351
Who is that? 
Go and see.

460
00:29:37,551 --> 00:29:38,768
You go and check.

461
00:29:38,968 --> 00:29:39,935
You go...

462
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,309
You're on the top.

463
00:29:41,509 --> 00:29:42,101
Go...

464
00:29:42,935 --> 00:29:44,309
Go now...

465
00:29:44,434 --> 00:29:45,768
Hey, you go.

466
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:47,835
I told you first. 
Go...

467
00:29:48,035 --> 00:29:50,060
So, I'm very tired. 
Go...

468
00:29:50,518 --> 00:29:52,643
I'm also very tired. 
You go...

469
00:29:52,843 --> 00:29:55,351
How mean this fellow?

470
00:29:55,392 --> 00:29:58,143
Go...go...

471
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:05,559
-Are you the new wife? 
-Yes.

472
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:07,101
-Where is sir? 
-Why?

473
00:30:07,301 --> 00:30:08,443
Have to give him milk.

474
00:30:08,643 --> 00:30:11,268
I'll give either milk or tea 
on alternate days...

475
00:30:11,468 --> 00:30:13,476
I'll wash utensils and 
the clothes.

476
00:30:13,676 --> 00:30:15,351
Servant?

477
00:30:15,392 --> 00:30:16,976
You can say as 'house-maid' too.

478
00:30:18,143 --> 00:30:19,735
Arrogant attitude for a servant?

479
00:30:19,935 --> 00:30:22,559
Nothing difference between 
the servant and wife.

480
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:24,518
Even the servant can become a wife.

481
00:30:24,718 --> 00:30:25,559
You know that, right?

482
00:30:25,935 --> 00:30:27,060
Jai!

483
00:30:32,476 --> 00:30:34,709
I thought she will be 
helpful to you.

484
00:30:34,909 --> 00:30:37,143
But you sent her and gave me the broom.

485
00:30:37,343 --> 00:30:38,559
Come here, sir.

486
00:30:38,601 --> 00:30:39,726
Sit down.

487
00:30:41,893 --> 00:30:43,309
I told you just now.

488
00:30:43,518 --> 00:30:45,268
We're for each other.

489
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:47,643
Whatever problem 
arises between us,

490
00:30:47,843 --> 00:30:49,351
...we've to solve on our own.

491
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:51,272
Nobody should interfere.

492
00:30:51,472 --> 00:30:53,185
Not even your parents.

493
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,143
Promise.

494
00:30:57,684 --> 00:30:58,651
Promise.

495
00:30:58,851 --> 00:31:00,418
All those happened long back...

496
00:31:00,618 --> 00:31:02,185
-Welcome dad! 
-Invite them.

497
00:31:02,684 --> 00:31:03,976
-Sorry, my son. 
-Welcome.

498
00:31:04,018 --> 00:31:05,268
I should've knocked the door 
and came inside.

499
00:31:05,468 --> 00:31:07,185
I don't have that kind of habit.

500
00:31:07,227 --> 00:31:09,309
Dad, be cool. 
Come, dad.

501
00:31:10,351 --> 00:31:11,943
-How are you my son? 
-I'm good, dad.

502
00:31:12,143 --> 00:31:14,768
-Very good, how is your life going on? 
-Excellent, dad.

503
00:31:14,968 --> 00:31:17,643
Will you please us with 
a grandchild by next year?

504
00:31:20,101 --> 00:31:21,976
Dad, we didn't plan it, yet.

505
00:31:22,018 --> 00:31:24,143
What? Didn't plan?

506
00:31:24,343 --> 00:31:24,985
Yes, aunty.

507
00:31:25,185 --> 00:31:29,476
-We're in five years plan. 
-Five years planning?

508
00:31:29,518 --> 00:31:32,834
Hey, soon after marriage 
you should have children.

509
00:31:33,034 --> 00:31:36,351
Only then, the children will be 
hale and healthy.

510
00:31:36,392 --> 00:31:38,334
For example, take yourself.

511
00:31:38,534 --> 00:31:40,476
I didn't even wait for a night.

512
00:31:40,676 --> 00:31:42,359
I started my job at day.

513
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,768
That's why, you're so brilliant. 
Idiot.

514
00:31:44,968 --> 00:31:46,059
Sorry, aunty.

515
00:31:46,259 --> 00:31:47,151
This is our life.

516
00:31:47,351 --> 00:31:49,559
We know what to do 
and what not to do.

517
00:31:50,101 --> 00:31:51,309
What are you saying?

518
00:31:52,851 --> 00:31:54,976
We too know everything, aunty.

519
00:31:56,227 --> 00:31:57,185
Aunty!

520
00:31:57,392 --> 00:32:00,726
Dear, I told on that day, she isn't 
the right choice for our family.

521
00:32:00,926 --> 00:32:01,559
Did you heed me?

522
00:32:01,601 --> 00:32:04,185
She says she'll have a child 
after five years.

523
00:32:04,227 --> 00:32:05,559
I'm talking regarding that.

524
00:32:05,601 --> 00:32:06,651
Be patient.

525
00:32:06,851 --> 00:32:08,893
You stay patiently 
and have feast.

526
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,185
-I'm leaving. 
-Mom!

527
00:32:11,518 --> 00:32:12,522
Albert sir!

528
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:13,726
I'm leaving.

529
00:32:13,976 --> 00:32:14,559
Dad!

530
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:16,768
We've come for the first time...

531
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:19,893
...but she isn't ashamed 
to be in improper attire.

532
00:32:20,101 --> 00:32:21,268
-Come, let's go. 
-Mom.

533
00:32:21,468 --> 00:32:22,664
Just wait, dear.

534
00:32:22,864 --> 00:32:23,860
You stay here.

535
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,185
-I'm leaving. 
-Wait, mom.

536
00:32:29,185 --> 00:32:30,351
What dear?

537
00:32:30,392 --> 00:32:32,309
This is the first time 
they've come home.

538
00:32:32,509 --> 00:32:33,860
Is this the way to behave?

539
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,693
Their visit is not the problem.

540
00:32:35,893 --> 00:32:38,234
Our lifestyle is different 
from their's.

541
00:32:38,434 --> 00:32:40,959
It's good not interfering 
in each other's lifestyle.

542
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:43,684
Last night, did you watch 
'Samsaram athu minsaram' film?

543
00:32:43,884 --> 00:32:44,185
Why?

544
00:32:44,227 --> 00:32:45,893
I can see the effect 
of that movie.

545
00:32:48,351 --> 00:32:49,709
Hey, get ready.

546
00:32:49,909 --> 00:32:50,926
I'll go tomorrow.

547
00:32:51,126 --> 00:32:52,222
Please, dear.

548
00:32:52,422 --> 00:32:53,318
No way. 
Go.

549
00:32:53,518 --> 00:32:54,735
I've work only at noon.

550
00:32:54,935 --> 00:32:56,768
No work in the morning. 
Come, let's go inside.

551
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:59,559
I can't take leave anymore. 
You go...

552
00:32:59,601 --> 00:33:01,101
Why are you compelling 
me to go?

553
00:33:01,301 --> 00:33:02,068
Is it boring?

554
00:33:02,268 --> 00:33:04,351
It shouldn't get boring, 
that's why, I'm saying.

555
00:33:07,309 --> 00:33:09,476
-Hey, wait... 
-No need to go?

556
00:33:10,351 --> 00:33:12,101
Come soon in the evening.

557
00:33:12,227 --> 00:33:13,643
Okay.

558
00:33:28,227 --> 00:33:31,101
[in unison] Wish you happy married life!

559
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:34,976
Thank you.

560
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:41,935
Hi, Genelia!

561
00:33:42,518 --> 00:33:43,443
Hi, David!

562
00:33:43,643 --> 00:33:45,851
-Happy married life. 
-Thank you.

563
00:33:46,601 --> 00:33:47,518
Thank you.

564
00:33:48,351 --> 00:33:49,935
Okay...okay...

565
00:33:50,185 --> 00:33:50,976
Carry on.

566
00:33:52,227 --> 00:33:53,901
-Hey no one is here. 
-Hi.

567
00:33:54,101 --> 00:33:57,309
-I think i'm the last person. 
-Come soon in the evening.

568
00:33:57,509 --> 00:33:58,434
I'll come.

569
00:33:59,434 --> 00:34:00,434
I'll come soon.

570
00:34:02,434 --> 00:34:03,526
You didn't apply for leave.

571
00:34:03,726 --> 00:34:05,626
Some problem is going on here. 
I'll call you later.

572
00:34:05,826 --> 00:34:07,726
If you do like this, 
I'll expel you from the team.

573
00:34:07,926 --> 00:34:08,684
Do you understand?

574
00:34:10,601 --> 00:34:13,143
Hey, I'm speaking to you 
but you're playful.

575
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:16,434
-Hey, bridegroom! 
-Thank you.

576
00:34:16,634 --> 00:34:18,185
Thank you.

577
00:34:18,227 --> 00:34:20,768
-Happy married life, darling! 
-Thank you.

578
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:23,443
Sir, why are you standing here?

579
00:34:23,643 --> 00:34:26,185
Just to wish you since you're coming 
to the office, post marriage.

580
00:34:26,385 --> 00:34:27,559
Sir, just a minute. 
Excuse me.

581
00:34:27,759 --> 00:34:29,651
I'll call you back.

582
00:34:29,851 --> 00:34:31,559
I'm taking leave for a week.

583
00:34:32,143 --> 00:34:33,976
-Hi! 
-Hi!

584
00:34:34,185 --> 00:34:36,480
-Welcome back! 
-Thank you.

585
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,519
Hi brother, how is the missus?

586
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,559
How is your life going on?

587
00:34:40,601 --> 00:34:42,351
Tell me, why didn't you 
attend the marriage?

588
00:34:42,551 --> 00:34:43,068
Why should I come?

589
00:34:43,268 --> 00:34:44,276
Are you going to tie 
the nuptial thread to me?

590
00:34:44,476 --> 00:34:46,518
Hey, can I tie the nuptial thread 
to everyone who comes?

591
00:34:46,718 --> 00:34:47,901
Talking like a goof.

592
00:34:48,101 --> 00:34:50,292
Then, I thought of making 
you to fall in my trap.

593
00:34:50,492 --> 00:34:52,684
But, you gave the invitation 
and disappointed me.

594
00:34:52,884 --> 00:34:53,935
How can I come, then?

595
00:34:54,135 --> 00:34:55,122
Hello, madam.

596
00:34:55,322 --> 00:34:56,109
He got married.

597
00:34:56,309 --> 00:34:58,351
Don't play with his family.

598
00:34:58,392 --> 00:35:00,726
He only got married 
not me.

599
00:35:01,935 --> 00:35:04,251
She is planning, seriously.

600
00:35:04,451 --> 00:35:06,768
Yes, I've planned a lot..

601
00:35:07,091 --> 00:35:09,568
Jai, newly wed! 
How about you?

602
00:35:09,768 --> 00:35:13,351
Releasing now or saying like JD 
after EMIs get over?

603
00:35:13,551 --> 00:35:15,892
I'm fond of child 
but JD is keen in EMIs.

604
00:35:16,092 --> 00:35:18,434
-JD, why is she saying so? 
-Then what?

605
00:35:18,634 --> 00:35:19,651
A flat on ECR...

606
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:21,501
Have to pay EMI for it.

607
00:35:21,701 --> 00:35:23,351
70" television at home.

608
00:35:23,392 --> 00:35:24,643
-EMI for it. 
-He too is watching, right?

609
00:35:24,843 --> 00:35:25,651
Then, sofa...

610
00:35:25,851 --> 00:35:27,976
And honeymoon in Balki.

611
00:35:28,018 --> 00:35:31,101
How to have a baby in the midst 
of this and pay EMIs?

612
00:35:34,101 --> 00:35:35,476
Pig, you eat the bun.

613
00:35:36,726 --> 00:35:38,351
You've EMI problem.

614
00:35:38,392 --> 00:35:39,276
He has gloves problem.

615
00:35:39,476 --> 00:35:41,143
Hey, why are you saying 
that now?

616
00:35:41,343 --> 00:35:41,985
Hey, be quiet.

617
00:35:42,185 --> 00:35:43,518
The torture you gave on 
your first night...

618
00:35:43,718 --> 00:35:44,526
Oh, gosh!

619
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:46,684
I'll thrash you if you open the mouth.

620
00:35:46,884 --> 00:35:48,109
Did you call him too?

621
00:35:48,309 --> 00:35:50,351
Are we running a medical store?

622
00:35:50,551 --> 00:35:52,538
Torturing us for gloves.

623
00:35:52,738 --> 00:35:54,526
Hey, did you ask JD too?

624
00:35:54,726 --> 00:35:57,893
He said he doesn't have. 
then, why did you call me too?

625
00:35:58,093 --> 00:35:59,893
Even he asked me 
who isn't married.

626
00:36:00,093 --> 00:36:01,559
That's why, he asked you.

627
00:36:02,227 --> 00:36:04,768
Didn't you allow anyone 
to sleep on that night?

628
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:08,434
-Why are you talking, awkwardly? 
-Awkward!

629
00:36:08,643 --> 00:36:10,476
Do you know what's the favourite 
of the youth?

630
00:36:10,676 --> 00:36:11,185
What's that?

631
00:36:11,227 --> 00:36:13,559
Not the music, sports or food.

632
00:36:13,759 --> 00:36:14,901
But, Kamasutra book.

633
00:36:15,101 --> 00:36:19,060
Hey Venki, those who hesitate 
to speak frankly about intimacy...

634
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,768
...will hit sixer for no ball 
at nights.

635
00:36:22,726 --> 00:36:24,851
What's that you're talking 
about 'no ball and sixer'?

636
00:36:25,051 --> 00:36:25,901
It's cricket.

637
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:28,443
Gloves, helmet, bat and ball.

638
00:36:28,643 --> 00:36:30,768
This is men sports. 
It's not right for you.

639
00:36:31,101 --> 00:36:32,438
What's that men and women sports?

640
00:36:32,638 --> 00:36:33,776
We can hit 
only if given chance.

641
00:36:33,976 --> 00:36:35,935
Only if given chance, 
even Virat kohli can prove himself.

642
00:36:36,135 --> 00:36:37,351
Else, a broiler chicken.

643
00:36:37,392 --> 00:36:38,768
You eat something.

644
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:40,480
When is your wedding party?

645
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,351
I've planned this weekend.

646
00:36:42,392 --> 00:36:43,768
We'll make it a grandeur.

647
00:36:44,434 --> 00:36:46,309
Look here, you didn't attend 
the marriage?

648
00:36:46,509 --> 00:36:47,559
Must attend this party for sure.

649
00:36:47,759 --> 00:36:48,735
Else, I'll get tensed.

650
00:36:48,935 --> 00:36:50,559
If you give me a special treat, 
I'll come.

651
00:36:50,759 --> 00:36:51,568
Specially?

652
00:36:51,768 --> 00:36:53,768
I'll buy you arrack, 
will you come?

653
00:37:13,309 --> 00:37:18,268
"If you're the King for you, 
I'm the King for me"

654
00:37:18,468 --> 00:37:22,997
"Let off the worries 
Let us sing along"?

655
00:37:23,197 --> 00:37:27,726
"If you're right for you 
I'm right for me"?

656
00:37:27,926 --> 00:37:32,276
"Let us host the party, jovially"?

657
00:37:32,476 --> 00:37:37,351
"If the bottles are empty 
Let us sing and rejoice"?

658
00:37:37,392 --> 00:37:42,185
"To live happily, there is shortcut"?

659
00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:46,893
"You should stay silent, if provoked 
You should stay calm, if irritated"?

660
00:37:47,093 --> 00:37:51,559
"Then, you life will be pleasant, 
our brother said so"

661
00:37:51,601 --> 00:37:56,434
"You should stay silent, if provoked 
You should stay calm, if irritated"?

662
00:37:56,634 --> 00:38:01,268
"Then, you life will be pleasant, 
our brother said so"

663
00:38:59,143 --> 00:39:01,351
"When you reach heights 
You'll be pulled down..."

664
00:39:01,392 --> 00:39:03,893
"You'll be pretty much 
pulled into fuss"?

665
00:39:04,093 --> 00:39:04,901
"Literally, uttering your name..."

666
00:39:05,101 --> 00:39:07,476
"Uttering about your hometown 
and uttering something"

667
00:39:07,676 --> 00:39:08,359
"...he'll come to blow"?

668
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:13,351
"Life is a circle 
The loser will win here"?

669
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:18,893
"Our brother said it... 
it'll be right."?

670
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:32,143
"Our life on this earth 
is for short span"?

671
00:39:32,343 --> 00:39:35,768
"Lead the life, happily"

672
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:41,793
"Hey, if you breathe last, a small 
skeletal piece will be left unburnt"

673
00:39:41,893 --> 00:39:46,526
"This is your life"

674
00:39:46,726 --> 00:39:51,776
"The crown on the head 
can be heavy"?

675
00:39:51,976 --> 00:39:56,643
"You shouldn't be heavy-headed 
at any time"?

676
00:39:56,843 --> 00:40:00,935
"Though whatever happens"

677
00:40:01,392 --> 00:40:05,976
"You should stay silent, if provoked 
You should stay calm, if irritated"?

678
00:40:06,176 --> 00:40:10,901
"Then, you life will be pleasant, 
our brother said so"

679
00:40:11,101 --> 00:40:15,726
"You should stay silent, if provoked 
You should stay calm, if irritated"?

680
00:40:15,926 --> 00:40:20,518
"Then, you life will be pleasant, 
our brother said so"

681
00:40:42,351 --> 00:40:44,434
Who is that?

682
00:40:46,227 --> 00:40:47,185
Please, go away.

683
00:40:47,385 --> 00:40:47,693
Why?

684
00:40:47,893 --> 00:40:49,151
You'll not come for party?

685
00:40:49,351 --> 00:40:50,893
Do you know how much 
Jenny expected you?

686
00:40:51,093 --> 00:40:52,684
So, you didn't expect me?

687
00:40:53,392 --> 00:40:55,351
I can't come for someone's expectations.

688
00:40:55,392 --> 00:40:56,693
Hey, is Jenny someone for you?

689
00:40:56,893 --> 00:40:59,559
Oh, I see! If you've become 
a proper husband...

690
00:40:59,759 --> 00:41:00,976
Do you know how you 
look like in anger?

691
00:41:01,176 --> 00:41:02,559
-Come. 
-Be quiet.

692
00:41:02,759 --> 00:41:03,976
Come on.

693
00:41:07,476 --> 00:41:10,185
-Hey! Please... 
-Don't hit me.

694
00:41:10,227 --> 00:41:11,101
No...

695
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,684
Hey!

696
00:41:23,227 --> 00:41:24,268
Yes!

697
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:30,185
Have you seen such brilliant 
goals in your life?

698
00:41:30,684 --> 00:41:31,768
Baby!

699
00:41:32,018 --> 00:41:32,651
Hello, baby!

700
00:41:32,851 --> 00:41:34,518
Why are you angry now?

701
00:41:39,185 --> 00:41:40,268
Thank you.

702
00:41:40,643 --> 00:41:43,309
You look like donald duck 
in anger.

703
00:41:51,018 --> 00:41:51,901
What's this?

704
00:41:52,101 --> 00:41:53,109
Varsha, my friend.

705
00:41:53,309 --> 00:41:54,726
Team mate. 
I told you, right?

706
00:41:54,926 --> 00:41:55,851
Why did you take selfie?

707
00:41:56,051 --> 00:41:56,976
I didn't take it. She did.

708
00:41:57,176 --> 00:41:57,526
Look there.

709
00:41:57,726 --> 00:41:58,943
That much close?

710
00:41:59,143 --> 00:42:00,976
Selfie will be taken close, right?

711
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,143
When did you click it?

712
00:42:02,392 --> 00:42:03,768
Not sure, might be yesterday 
or day before...

713
00:42:03,968 --> 00:42:04,351
Why?

714
00:42:04,392 --> 00:42:05,559
Why didn't you tell me?

715
00:42:05,601 --> 00:42:06,359
Why didn't...

716
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:08,434
Hey, just for taking a photo...

717
00:42:08,634 --> 00:42:09,935
Don't talk to me.

718
00:42:12,601 --> 00:42:14,559
Oh, you've lost the game...

719
00:42:14,759 --> 00:42:15,776
Don't irritate me.

720
00:42:15,976 --> 00:42:17,935
Don't come to the room, tonight. 
Sleep here.

721
00:42:18,135 --> 00:42:18,768
Why?

722
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:20,101
Because, you're a vegetarian, today.

723
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,456
Hey, at least an egg...

724
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:23,666
Just shut up!

725
00:42:42,676 --> 00:42:43,926
Jenny, coffee...

726
00:42:46,343 --> 00:42:48,009
Are you washing clothes?

727
00:42:58,551 --> 00:42:59,718
I'm out.

728
00:43:00,051 --> 00:43:01,551
Eat outside.

729
00:43:02,385 --> 00:43:03,435
How can I eat outside?

730
00:43:03,635 --> 00:43:05,093
I can eat through mouth, right?

731
00:43:13,081 --> 00:43:16,188
[phone rings]

732
00:43:24,173 --> 00:43:27,349
[phone rings]

733
00:43:47,259 --> 00:43:49,143
Is this the first fight?

734
00:43:49,343 --> 00:43:52,426
Look, I'm very annoyed with you. 
Please, be quiet.

735
00:43:52,626 --> 00:43:53,476
What did I do?

736
00:43:53,676 --> 00:43:55,343
Why did you send me 
the photos, yesterday?

737
00:43:55,543 --> 00:43:57,134
I just sent photo.

738
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:58,510
You just sent a photo.

739
00:43:58,967 --> 00:44:00,510
Yeah, you just sent a photo.

740
00:44:01,218 --> 00:44:02,760
That's what, I didn't know 
what happened.

741
00:44:03,301 --> 00:44:05,760
If this is the stance for just a photo, 
what if our matters are known?

742
00:44:05,802 --> 00:44:07,076
Our matters?

743
00:44:07,276 --> 00:44:08,918
The love matter.

744
00:44:09,118 --> 00:44:10,560
Hey, be quiet.

745
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,218
Hello, it's okay about love.

746
00:44:13,593 --> 00:44:14,884
What's that 'matter' you said?

747
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:17,884
That's meant, only booze for you.

748
00:44:18,084 --> 00:44:19,643
Come to my issue.

749
00:44:19,843 --> 00:44:22,551
Darling, that's why I said 
don't get married.

750
00:44:22,751 --> 00:44:24,143
Support, 'live in relationship'.

751
00:44:24,343 --> 00:44:26,551
You can hug if you like 
or can break up.

752
00:44:26,593 --> 00:44:28,310
Do anyone buy a wine 
shop for just few pegs?

753
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:31,009
Hey, don't listen to these 
hardcore single people.

754
00:44:31,209 --> 00:44:32,218
They'll take you to the road.

755
00:44:32,635 --> 00:44:35,093
Go home and fall on her feet...

756
00:44:35,426 --> 00:44:38,093
Only then, 
you can enjoy tonight.

757
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:43,218
That's why, is JD always...

758
00:44:44,259 --> 00:44:45,305
Hey, come here.

759
00:44:45,505 --> 00:44:46,351
I'll not come.

760
00:44:46,551 --> 00:44:48,551
-Hit him. 
-Have it.

761
00:44:49,093 --> 00:44:50,551
We've bouncers.

762
00:44:50,593 --> 00:44:51,551
Look here, darling!

763
00:44:51,802 --> 00:44:53,556
This 'you or me' debate 
will not work out.

764
00:44:53,756 --> 00:44:55,510
Girls will never give up 
in this issue.

765
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:56,343
Yes, that's right.

766
00:44:56,385 --> 00:44:58,301
Hey, it's not right.

767
00:44:58,501 --> 00:44:59,560
You're supreme!

768
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,426
If I know that you apologised, 
I'll kill you.

769
00:45:02,626 --> 00:45:03,343
This is also right.

770
00:45:03,385 --> 00:45:05,843
I'm telling him, isn't it? 
Why are you confusing him?

771
00:45:06,043 --> 00:45:08,093
He can't leave his supremacy, right?

772
00:45:08,593 --> 00:45:12,551
Supremacy? 
I'm the supreme!

773
00:45:13,676 --> 00:45:15,426
Under maintenance?

774
00:45:15,802 --> 00:45:18,510
The sign is not good omen.

775
00:45:19,343 --> 00:45:21,051
It's better to surrender.

776
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,343
Do I've to climb thirteen floors?

777
00:45:23,543 --> 00:45:24,218
Okay.

778
00:45:39,718 --> 00:45:40,676
Oh, God!

779
00:45:42,676 --> 00:45:44,134
Forgive me!

780
00:46:01,385 --> 00:46:02,468
Jenny!

781
00:46:02,967 --> 00:46:03,846
Jai!

782
00:46:04,046 --> 00:46:04,926
Sorry...

783
00:46:05,426 --> 00:46:06,826
I'm so sorry.

784
00:46:07,026 --> 00:46:08,426
I'm sorry.

785
00:46:08,843 --> 00:46:10,597
-It's all my mistake. 
-Okay.

786
00:46:10,797 --> 00:46:12,551
I shouldn't have cut your call.

787
00:46:12,593 --> 00:46:13,760
Please, forgive me.

788
00:46:14,593 --> 00:46:16,926
I'm so sorry.

789
00:46:19,884 --> 00:46:21,343
I'm so sorry.

790
00:46:47,446 --> 00:46:49,806
"I never felt such a pleasure..."

791
00:46:50,263 --> 00:46:56,215
"...so far"

792
00:46:56,415 --> 00:46:59,760
"My heart conveys gratefulness, everyday"

793
00:46:59,802 --> 00:47:04,926
"Our breathe binds together 
and caress each other"

794
00:47:06,216 --> 00:47:12,134
"The bed will be blazed, 
more than the wildfire."

795
00:47:12,334 --> 00:47:15,343
"Your caressing look is enough"

796
00:47:15,385 --> 00:47:18,301
"Little affection is enough"

797
00:47:18,403 --> 00:47:20,760
"This is...this is...enough..."

798
00:47:20,802 --> 00:47:24,093
"Forever and ever..."

799
00:47:24,193 --> 00:47:27,760
"Leaning on your shoulder"

800
00:47:27,802 --> 00:47:30,718
"Holding your finger"

801
00:47:30,818 --> 00:47:33,226
"Till dawn..."

802
00:47:33,426 --> 00:47:36,843
"I must play with you"

803
00:47:37,311 --> 00:47:39,740
"I never felt such a pleasure..."

804
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:45,906
"...so far"

805
00:47:46,385 --> 00:47:49,643
"My heart conveys gratefulness, everyday"

806
00:47:49,843 --> 00:47:55,551
"Our breathe binds together 
and caress each other"

807
00:47:55,995 --> 00:48:01,934
"The bed will be blazed, 
more than the wildfire."

808
00:48:47,884 --> 00:48:49,760
Baby, is everything okay?

809
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,059
What's that okay?

810
00:48:52,259 --> 00:48:54,551
You turned off the cooker 
for second whistle.

811
00:48:59,718 --> 00:49:01,134
What did you say now?

812
00:49:01,334 --> 00:49:01,851
Nothing.

813
00:49:02,051 --> 00:49:04,551
I heard as whistle.

814
00:49:05,343 --> 00:49:07,468
Golden words are not repeated.

815
00:49:08,593 --> 00:49:11,426
I like you talking, frankly.

816
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,134
I too like you asking, frankly.

817
00:49:16,468 --> 00:49:18,718
How many husbands are 
concerned about this?

818
00:49:18,918 --> 00:49:20,059
Because of not speaking frankly...

819
00:49:20,259 --> 00:49:25,093
...many women are leaving 
their husband or killing them.

820
00:49:25,293 --> 00:49:27,134
So, are you going to 
kill me, now?

821
00:49:27,334 --> 00:49:28,342
No idea as of now.

822
00:49:28,542 --> 00:49:29,551
I've to think.

823
00:49:29,593 --> 00:49:30,518
You traitor!

824
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:32,343
What do you think 
about life?

825
00:49:32,385 --> 00:49:34,310
If there is no intimacy, 
there is no life.

826
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:37,551
Separate the intimacy from life, 
there is no life at all.

827
00:49:37,593 --> 00:49:38,760
It's waste of living.

828
00:49:38,802 --> 00:49:41,684
Hey, I thought you studied 
information technology.

829
00:49:41,884 --> 00:49:45,134
But, you speak like the doctor doing 
show in television at midnight.

830
00:49:45,635 --> 00:49:46,843
Stop talking.

831
00:49:47,009 --> 00:49:48,226
Shall we start the match?

832
00:49:48,426 --> 00:49:50,510
Today, I'll hit hundred 
and not out.

833
00:49:57,176 --> 00:49:58,551
Sir, this is the latest model.

834
00:49:58,751 --> 00:49:59,884
'Grand i10'

835
00:50:00,259 --> 00:50:01,101
Good. 
Excellent!

836
00:50:01,301 --> 00:50:02,218
Will you give along 
with this ribbon?

837
00:50:02,418 --> 00:50:02,726
Yes, sir.

838
00:50:02,926 --> 00:50:04,259
You prefer the colour 
and place the order.

839
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:05,268
We'll deliver it in a week.

840
00:50:05,468 --> 00:50:07,134
-Will it bear the weight? 
-Yes, of course.

841
00:50:07,426 --> 00:50:08,018
For two people?

842
00:50:08,218 --> 00:50:10,843
It can accommodate four people 
and you can take a dog also.

843
00:50:11,043 --> 00:50:12,843
-Not inside. On top. 
-On top?

844
00:50:13,884 --> 00:50:14,684
Why dear?

845
00:50:14,884 --> 00:50:16,760
Isn't breaking the dining table, enough?

846
00:50:17,301 --> 00:50:18,722
Okay, will you see the car?

847
00:50:18,922 --> 00:50:20,343
-Come, sir. 
-Yeah, come on.

848
00:50:21,468 --> 00:50:23,351
Sir, I'll tell the facilities 
of this car.

849
00:50:23,551 --> 00:50:28,134
AVS, power steering, LED, 
DRL, alloy wheels, air bags.

850
00:50:28,334 --> 00:50:31,468
Moreover, there is a camera sensor 
in the car.

851
00:50:31,668 --> 00:50:33,259
Oh, is there camera too?

852
00:50:34,343 --> 00:50:35,760
Can we take a selfie?

853
00:50:37,426 --> 00:50:38,560
Leave it, sir.

854
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:42,926
If you ride on highways, 
the car will fly like a spark.

855
00:50:43,126 --> 00:50:44,435
Any doubt, sir?

856
00:50:44,635 --> 00:50:46,343
-Just one doubt. 
-Tell me, sir.

857
00:50:46,385 --> 00:50:49,301
Will you give anything to 
extinguish the flying spark?

858
00:50:50,259 --> 00:50:50,926
Enemy!

859
00:50:53,843 --> 00:50:55,510
Have you come to buy 
the car or to irritate me?

860
00:50:55,710 --> 00:50:56,343
Then what, sir?

861
00:50:56,385 --> 00:51:00,218
We've come to buy a car by taking 
loan and repay by hard work.

862
00:51:00,418 --> 00:51:02,343
Whereas, you're speaking, 
inauspiciously.

863
00:51:02,385 --> 00:51:03,435
Congratulations, sir!

864
00:51:03,635 --> 00:51:05,760
I too have the same problem.

865
00:51:05,802 --> 00:51:08,059
Recently, I bought a new house.

866
00:51:08,259 --> 00:51:10,426
Only if you buy a car, 
I can pay my loan.

867
00:51:10,626 --> 00:51:11,843
Please sir, buy it sir.

868
00:51:12,051 --> 00:51:13,843
Oh no! He is thinking... 
I shouldn't leave him.

869
00:51:14,043 --> 00:51:14,684
Sir, come on.

870
00:51:14,884 --> 00:51:16,843
Let's go for a ride till ECR. 
Get up.

871
00:51:18,176 --> 00:51:19,760
-Good morning, David. 
-Good morning, Jenny.

872
00:51:19,802 --> 00:51:21,093
What's the status of the project?

873
00:51:21,293 --> 00:51:22,218
It's yet to be finished.

874
00:51:22,418 --> 00:51:23,343
Just give me ten minutes.

875
00:51:23,543 --> 00:51:24,134
I'll finish it.

876
00:51:24,176 --> 00:51:25,643
No problem, sit here and do.

877
00:51:25,843 --> 00:51:27,843
-I'll get my laptop. 
-Hey, come on...

878
00:51:28,551 --> 00:51:29,551
Use my laptop.

879
00:51:29,593 --> 00:51:30,510
Thanks.

880
00:51:52,967 --> 00:51:55,926
Jenny, can I order you a coffee?

881
00:51:56,126 --> 00:51:57,218
No, thanks.

882
00:51:57,418 --> 00:51:58,009
Okay.

883
00:52:00,176 --> 00:52:01,809
How is your married life?

884
00:52:02,009 --> 00:52:04,218
It's good, sir. 
Nice, I'm happy.

885
00:52:05,926 --> 00:52:07,134
How is your husband?

886
00:52:07,176 --> 00:52:08,059
He is good, sir.

887
00:52:08,259 --> 00:52:10,218
Very jovial and sportive.

888
00:52:11,385 --> 00:52:12,843
Fine... fine...

889
00:52:14,802 --> 00:52:16,051
Are you free this weekend?

890
00:52:16,593 --> 00:52:18,093
Yeah, almost...

891
00:52:18,676 --> 00:52:20,051
If you don't mind...

892
00:52:21,051 --> 00:52:23,218
...can you join me for dinner?

893
00:52:27,009 --> 00:52:29,173
No, If you come for dinner...

894
00:52:29,685 --> 00:52:32,894
...salary appraisal, on-site trip and all.

895
00:52:33,218 --> 00:52:34,676
You'll be benefited.

896
00:52:45,343 --> 00:52:47,343
Baby, why are you dull?

897
00:52:47,551 --> 00:52:48,843
Is it those three days?

898
00:52:52,051 --> 00:52:53,134
Get lost!

899
00:52:53,843 --> 00:52:54,676
Get out!

900
00:52:55,093 --> 00:52:56,343
That's all?

901
00:52:56,510 --> 00:52:57,926
Who is he to expel you from job?

902
00:52:58,126 --> 00:52:59,226
Tell me, shall I expel him?

903
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:02,388
Not that, by slapping him 
and losing my job...

904
00:53:02,588 --> 00:53:05,551
...my salary will become 
a shortage in our budget.

905
00:53:05,751 --> 00:53:07,510
We are planning to buy a car too.

906
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:09,059
That's why, I'm thinking.

907
00:53:09,259 --> 00:53:13,343
Baby, why are you thinking 
seriously about this simple issue?

908
00:53:13,551 --> 00:53:15,226
We've planned many things.

909
00:53:15,426 --> 00:53:19,343
If not your salary, 
we'll reduce our needs and be happy.

910
00:53:19,543 --> 00:53:20,809
You take rest in home, happily.

911
00:53:21,009 --> 00:53:25,051
Oh, are you trying to make me 
as a servant with this as a reason?

912
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:26,926
No chance.

913
00:53:26,967 --> 00:53:28,259
I'll get a different job.

914
00:53:28,676 --> 00:53:30,926
But, I'll feel bored till then.

915
00:53:31,093 --> 00:53:33,301
Shall I take leave 
and be with you?

916
00:53:33,718 --> 00:53:35,059
You're saying it, simply?

917
00:53:35,259 --> 00:53:36,909
If they expel you 
from the company?

918
00:53:37,109 --> 00:53:38,760
Let's both together 
start a company.

919
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,426
'Mannar and company'.

920
00:53:40,802 --> 00:53:42,093
Be serious.

921
00:53:43,385 --> 00:53:45,551
Okay, you apply for other companies.

922
00:53:45,593 --> 00:53:47,134
Anyhow, you'll get a job 
for your experience.

923
00:53:47,334 --> 00:53:48,947
Let's go for a holiday, till then.

924
00:53:49,147 --> 00:53:50,760
We didn't go for honeymoon too.

925
00:53:51,884 --> 00:53:53,760
Okay, what's the plan?

926
00:53:54,635 --> 00:53:56,218
Shall we go to Shirdi saibaba temple?

927
00:53:56,418 --> 00:53:57,343
Oh, no!

928
00:53:57,510 --> 00:53:58,635
Let's go to Shimla.

929
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:07,687
After a few days...

930
00:54:24,843 --> 00:54:27,718
-Yes, this isn't hot. 
-Hey, Varsha!

931
00:54:28,134 --> 00:54:30,510
Hi, how are you?

932
00:54:31,593 --> 00:54:32,268
Hard hit.

933
00:54:32,468 --> 00:54:34,468
You left without telling me. 
That's why.

934
00:54:41,009 --> 00:54:41,951
Sorry, Varsha.

935
00:54:42,151 --> 00:54:43,093
No reaction.

936
00:54:45,802 --> 00:54:47,760
I told sorry, isn't it? 
Speak to me.

937
00:54:47,967 --> 00:54:49,468
No reaction. 
Maintaining the same.

938
00:54:51,884 --> 00:54:54,117
Hereafter, wherever I go 
I'll inform you. Okay?

939
00:54:54,317 --> 00:54:56,396
Now I need to go to restroom. 
Shall I leave.

940
00:54:56,596 --> 00:54:58,676
Varsha, say him okay. 
Else, he might do it here.

941
00:55:03,009 --> 00:55:04,760
Darling, why is she going 
when you need to go?

942
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:05,926
That too in hurry.

943
00:55:05,967 --> 00:55:07,134
Shouldn't she go 
to the restroom?

944
00:55:07,176 --> 00:55:07,560
Look at your job.

945
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,051
Keen on checking who is 
going to restroom.

946
00:55:18,809 --> 00:55:20,642
Hey, I'll tell you a happy news.

947
00:55:20,842 --> 00:55:21,734
I got a job.

948
00:55:21,934 --> 00:55:24,684
Excellent! Congrats! 
Delighted!

949
00:55:24,884 --> 00:55:26,142
Thank you.

950
00:55:26,183 --> 00:55:27,434
Where?

951
00:55:27,726 --> 00:55:28,767
That's a surprise.

952
00:55:28,809 --> 00:55:29,559
Come early.

953
00:55:29,601 --> 00:55:31,109
And don't forget to get 
the gloves.

954
00:55:31,309 --> 00:55:34,434
I'm going to give 
a dirty party, tonight.

955
00:55:36,225 --> 00:55:38,767
Has it got punctured?

956
00:55:39,475 --> 00:55:40,934
Okay, park it over there. 
I'll drop you.

957
00:55:41,134 --> 00:55:41,900
It's okay.

958
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:43,109
Don't do too much.

959
00:55:43,309 --> 00:55:44,684
Park it. 
I'll drop you.

960
00:56:04,018 --> 00:56:05,726
Stop...stop...

961
00:56:06,934 --> 00:56:09,142
Instead of your house, 
you brought me somewhere.

962
00:56:09,342 --> 00:56:10,767
That is...

963
00:56:11,225 --> 00:56:14,267
Sentimentally, that house 
isn't good for my love.

964
00:56:14,467 --> 00:56:15,767
So, I told my dad and 
shifted the house.

965
00:56:15,967 --> 00:56:17,434
You didn't tell me.

966
00:56:17,634 --> 00:56:18,234
If I tell?

967
00:56:18,434 --> 00:56:20,150
Okay. Shall I leave?

968
00:56:20,350 --> 00:56:21,976
You've come to my house. 
Come inside.

969
00:56:22,176 --> 00:56:23,059
Inside?

970
00:56:23,434 --> 00:56:26,309
-Okay, sir. 
-Okay, I'll come.

971
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:30,767
Isn't there anyone at home?

972
00:56:30,809 --> 00:56:33,642
My parents have gone to Coimbatore 
to attend a marriage.

973
00:56:36,642 --> 00:56:38,225
Sit down.

974
00:56:39,517 --> 00:56:40,851
You've come to my house, 
for the first time.

975
00:56:41,051 --> 00:56:42,225
Would you like to have 
coffee or tea?

976
00:56:42,475 --> 00:56:43,892
Can I get anything cool?

977
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:45,934
Cool?

978
00:56:47,851 --> 00:56:50,642
Only cool beer is available. 
is it okay?

979
00:56:50,842 --> 00:56:51,976
Superb!

980
00:57:02,142 --> 00:57:03,642
-Cheers! 
-Cheers!

981
00:57:08,142 --> 00:57:09,267
Is it bitter!

982
00:57:09,934 --> 00:57:11,934
It would be so, at first. 
Then, it'll be alright.

983
00:57:12,134 --> 00:57:12,726
Drink it.

984
00:57:15,517 --> 00:57:17,559
Just wait for two minutes. 
I'll come.

985
00:57:42,976 --> 00:57:45,142
Then, I thought of making 
you to fall in my trap.

986
00:57:45,183 --> 00:57:47,559
But, you gave the invitation 
and disappointed me.

987
00:57:47,767 --> 00:57:49,934
If this is the stance for just a photo, 
what if our matters are known?

988
00:57:50,134 --> 00:57:50,942
Our matters?

989
00:57:51,142 --> 00:57:53,267
The love matter.

990
00:57:54,392 --> 00:57:54,976
Hard hit.

991
00:57:55,018 --> 00:57:57,100
You left without telling me. 
That's why.

992
00:58:06,434 --> 00:58:09,100
Hey, why did you open my room?

993
00:58:09,559 --> 00:58:10,646
What's this?

994
00:58:10,846 --> 00:58:11,934
I like it.

995
00:58:12,309 --> 00:58:13,434
Like it, means?

996
00:58:13,809 --> 00:58:15,976
It means, what I mean as I like. 
Fool.

997
00:58:25,225 --> 00:58:26,559
Can't understand.

998
00:58:27,892 --> 00:58:31,851
If we like some hero, we'll 
keep his photo, isn't it?

999
00:58:32,051 --> 00:58:33,267
It's the same.

1000
00:58:33,892 --> 00:58:35,767
I'm not a hero.

1001
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:38,934
You're the hero for me!

1002
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:44,559
Is it enough? 
Take it.

1003
00:58:46,892 --> 00:58:48,559
Doesn't it taste bitter for you?

1004
00:58:53,538 --> 00:58:56,956
[phone rings]

1005
00:58:57,642 --> 00:58:58,976
Hey!

1006
00:59:00,142 --> 00:59:02,267
What are you doing?

1007
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:08,434
Are you in love?

1008
00:59:09,225 --> 00:59:10,350
I don't know.

1009
00:59:10,392 --> 00:59:11,854
Don't know, means?

1010
00:59:12,054 --> 00:59:13,517
Don't know only.

1011
00:59:13,642 --> 00:59:16,350
I got married.

1012
00:59:16,767 --> 00:59:18,059
I know...

1013
00:59:18,475 --> 00:59:19,734
I know, means?

1014
00:59:19,934 --> 00:59:21,767
I know, you wastrel.

1015
00:59:29,746 --> 00:59:33,350
-Hello.  
-Hello, Venky!

1016
00:59:33,550 --> 00:59:35,067
Is Jai with you?

1017
00:59:35,267 --> 00:59:37,559
No, Jenny. 
He had started long before.

1018
00:59:37,759 --> 00:59:38,934
Why? What happened?

1019
00:59:39,559 --> 00:59:40,442
Jenny!

1020
00:59:40,642 --> 00:59:41,851
Hello!

1021
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:55,934
[singing song]

1022
00:59:56,684 --> 00:59:58,892
[singing song]

1023
00:59:58,992 --> 01:00:00,517
What's your dream?

1024
01:00:01,142 --> 01:00:03,142
To lie in your lap.

1025
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:05,309
Thank you.

1026
01:00:21,350 --> 01:00:22,684
Thank you for the beer.

1027
01:00:22,884 --> 01:00:24,559
I'm leaving.

1028
01:00:27,851 --> 01:00:29,100
Are you going?

1029
01:00:29,767 --> 01:00:32,900
No... in home...

1030
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:35,059
-Sunny...Jenny... 
-Go away.

1031
01:00:36,767 --> 01:00:37,567
Bye.

1032
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:42,142
My watch... phone... helmet.

1033
01:00:43,976 --> 01:00:46,059
Bye.

1034
01:00:48,934 --> 01:00:49,976
What happened?

1035
01:00:55,225 --> 01:00:58,934
Will you lay me on bed and go?

1036
01:00:59,134 --> 01:01:02,976
Lay you on bed?

1037
01:01:06,475 --> 01:01:09,225
I'm so happy, today.

1038
01:01:28,267 --> 01:01:30,350
Okay, sleep.

1039
01:01:30,934 --> 01:01:32,934
-Bye. 
-Bye.

1040
01:01:35,225 --> 01:01:39,934
Hey, will you kiss me 
and leave?

1041
01:01:41,407 --> 01:01:42,602
Kiss!

1042
01:01:48,142 --> 01:01:49,976
Can I get one more beer?

1043
01:01:51,309 --> 01:01:52,892
It's in the fridge.

1044
01:02:06,309 --> 01:02:09,434
I should just kiss her 
and leave, immediately.

1045
01:02:09,634 --> 01:02:10,851
Where is the room?

1046
01:02:32,225 --> 01:02:36,434
The person you are calling is 
speaking to someone else.

1047
01:02:36,634 --> 01:02:38,684
You can stay online or...

1048
01:02:47,434 --> 01:02:48,688
Hi, Jenny!

1049
01:02:48,888 --> 01:02:50,142
Welcome, sir.

1050
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:53,142
I bought it.

1051
01:02:54,267 --> 01:02:55,851
Ate?

1052
01:02:56,225 --> 01:02:58,142
This is not for eating.

1053
01:02:58,183 --> 01:03:00,559
Did you eat?

1054
01:03:00,934 --> 01:03:03,059
I'm very hungry, Jenny.

1055
01:03:03,259 --> 01:03:05,934
Are you drunk?

1056
01:03:08,018 --> 01:03:09,480
Just.

1057
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:11,142
Just!

1058
01:03:12,934 --> 01:03:14,317
Come, darling.

1059
01:03:14,517 --> 01:03:16,726
Don't be afraid. 
Come on.

1060
01:03:23,809 --> 01:03:28,350
Darling, I bought the dining table 
for you, which you've broken.

1061
01:03:28,546 --> 01:03:32,083
She's speaking with a lot of respect. 
I'm caught it looks.

1062
01:03:42,642 --> 01:03:43,767
Enough.

1063
01:03:49,726 --> 01:03:51,142
Eat.

1064
01:03:52,183 --> 01:03:53,892
I'll eat.

1065
01:03:55,392 --> 01:03:57,100
Eat well, sir.

1066
01:03:58,892 --> 01:04:00,559
It tastes so much nicer today.

1067
01:04:00,759 --> 01:04:01,859
Double strong.

1068
01:04:02,059 --> 01:04:03,267
It'll be like that only.

1069
01:04:08,025 --> 01:04:10,403
[coughs]

1070
01:04:11,642 --> 01:04:14,767
-My throat is burning. 
-Hey, don't over react.

1071
01:04:14,967 --> 01:04:15,734
I thought of pouring it.

1072
01:04:15,934 --> 01:04:17,517
I can't open. 
You came by that time.

1073
01:04:17,717 --> 01:04:18,892
Couldn't open it?

1074
01:04:19,809 --> 01:04:20,726
Oh, my god!

1075
01:04:22,018 --> 01:04:24,434
In few minutes, 
everything came down.

1076
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:28,559
Where were you wandering 
till 2 o'clock?

1077
01:04:28,759 --> 01:04:29,692
Am I wandering?

1078
01:04:29,892 --> 01:04:31,142
I went to Venki's house.

1079
01:04:31,183 --> 01:04:34,767
Oh, you mean the Venki whom 
I spoke before half an hour?

1080
01:04:34,967 --> 01:04:36,859
Half an hour before?

1081
01:04:37,059 --> 01:04:38,559
Whom are you mentioning about?

1082
01:04:38,759 --> 01:04:40,526
My colleague, A. Venki?

1083
01:04:40,726 --> 01:04:42,396
Do you know, who I'm talking about?

1084
01:04:42,596 --> 01:04:44,873
Tell me, who are you 
saying about?

1085
01:04:45,073 --> 01:04:47,150
He is K.Venki... 
K.K.Nagar Venki.

1086
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:49,792
We both studied together 
in childhood.

1087
01:04:49,992 --> 01:04:52,434
He came from U.S and called for a party.

1088
01:04:52,634 --> 01:04:53,317
So, I went there.

1089
01:04:53,517 --> 01:04:56,350
-Hey, do I look like a goof? 
-No.

1090
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:58,142
I called & you disconnected my call.

1091
01:04:58,342 --> 01:04:58,952
Disconnect your call! When?

1092
01:04:59,152 --> 01:05:00,475
Where is your phone?

1093
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:01,734
Here it is.

1094
01:05:01,934 --> 01:05:02,938
Put it on charge. Go.

1095
01:05:03,138 --> 01:05:04,142
Where is your phone?

1096
01:05:04,892 --> 01:05:05,692
My phone!

1097
01:05:05,892 --> 01:05:08,976
Why are you talking like 
your phone and my phone?

1098
01:05:09,018 --> 01:05:10,563
We both are unified...

1099
01:05:10,763 --> 01:05:12,309
Where is your phone?

1100
01:05:13,183 --> 01:05:15,350
My phone is in office. 
I put it on charge.

1101
01:05:15,392 --> 01:05:16,067
Let's take in the morning.

1102
01:05:16,267 --> 01:05:18,517
Have you kept it in charge? 
Okay.

1103
01:05:19,297 --> 01:05:20,368
Whom are you calling?

1104
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:23,475
-Show me.-Hello!

1105
01:05:27,392 --> 01:05:28,225
Speak now.

1106
01:05:29,726 --> 01:05:31,109
-Speak now.-Hello!

1107
01:05:31,309 --> 01:05:32,767
Jai, when did you leave?

1108
01:05:32,809 --> 01:05:34,442
When I was awake, 
you're missing.

1109
01:05:34,642 --> 01:05:37,767
Hey, hang up the phone. 
Let's go shopping, tomorrow.

1110
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:38,567
Are you enacting drama?

1111
01:05:38,767 --> 01:05:41,729
-No, dear. 
-Often, I do mimicry.

1112
01:05:41,929 --> 01:05:44,692
I can't forget this night.

1113
01:05:44,892 --> 01:05:46,934
-I just enjoyed a lot. 
-Disconnect it.

1114
01:05:47,642 --> 01:05:49,726
-Who are you?-Who are you?

1115
01:05:49,926 --> 01:05:51,067
I'm Jenny, Jai's wife.

1116
01:05:51,267 --> 01:05:53,142
I'm Varsha, Jai's life.

1117
01:05:53,183 --> 01:05:54,684
What the hell you 
think of yourself?

1118
01:05:54,704 --> 01:05:55,818
What are you thinking, 
you're a...

1119
01:05:56,059 --> 01:05:57,142
Get lost.

1120
01:06:08,601 --> 01:06:10,225
You're lying to me.

1121
01:06:10,767 --> 01:06:12,100
No, Jenny.

1122
01:06:13,809 --> 01:06:16,767
-You've cheated on me. 
-Listen me, Jenny...

1123
01:06:17,767 --> 01:06:19,225
My life is over.

1124
01:06:19,255 --> 01:06:21,665
Jenny, I went there. But, I 
didn't do anything. Please Jenny.

1125
01:06:22,347 --> 01:06:23,217
Jenny! Jenny!

1126
01:06:23,237 --> 01:06:26,442
How could you do this to me?

1127
01:06:26,642 --> 01:06:29,517
-Don't show me your face, everafter. 
-Jenny!

1128
01:06:29,717 --> 01:06:31,559
I don't want to see. 
Go...

1129
01:06:31,759 --> 01:06:33,142
Jenny!

1130
01:06:34,018 --> 01:06:35,559
Please, Jenny!

1131
01:06:35,759 --> 01:06:36,567
Jenny!

1132
01:06:36,767 --> 01:06:37,542
Baby! 
Please!

1133
01:06:37,742 --> 01:06:38,654
Open the door.

1134
01:06:38,854 --> 01:06:39,710
Please, baby!

1135
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:40,767
I'm hungry.

1136
01:06:40,809 --> 01:06:42,100
Please Jenny, open the door.

1137
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:42,975
Please, baby!

1138
01:06:43,175 --> 01:06:44,058
Open the door.

1139
01:06:44,258 --> 01:06:45,142
Please, baby!

1140
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:11,650
Jenny!

1141
01:07:12,609 --> 01:07:13,192
Jenny!

1142
01:07:13,775 --> 01:07:14,442
Jenny!

1143
01:07:14,484 --> 01:07:15,233
Sorry, dear!

1144
01:07:15,433 --> 01:07:15,992
Jenny!

1145
01:07:16,192 --> 01:07:16,859
Sorry, dear!

1146
01:07:16,901 --> 01:07:17,859
-Please. 
-Leave my hand.

1147
01:07:18,059 --> 01:07:18,609
Please, Jenny!

1148
01:07:18,809 --> 01:07:19,150
Jenny!

1149
01:07:25,066 --> 01:07:26,859
Why Priya is not seen 
for long time?

1150
01:07:26,901 --> 01:07:29,108
Unable to bear JD's torture, 
she has changed the team.

1151
01:07:29,308 --> 01:07:29,859
Oh, no!

1152
01:07:29,901 --> 01:07:30,738
I'm not bothered.

1153
01:07:30,938 --> 01:07:31,775
It's good for me.

1154
01:07:32,275 --> 01:07:34,192
-Why? 
-You're next to me, now.

1155
01:07:40,442 --> 01:07:42,779
-Hey, give the phone. 
-I won't give.

1156
01:07:42,979 --> 01:07:45,317
-Give me. Don't irritate. 
-Irritating?

1157
01:07:45,517 --> 01:07:46,358
What did I do?

1158
01:07:47,025 --> 01:07:48,775
Why did you speak 
to Jenny so harsh?

1159
01:07:49,484 --> 01:07:51,442
-What did I speak? 
-Asking me, what you spoke?

1160
01:07:51,983 --> 01:07:54,175
Jai is my life... 
This and that...

1161
01:07:54,375 --> 01:07:56,367
She pushed me out 
because of you.

1162
01:07:56,567 --> 01:07:58,775
-I didn't speak, anything. 
-Don't irritate me.

1163
01:07:58,975 --> 01:07:59,525
Give the phone.

1164
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:03,358
Sorry.

1165
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,025
Darling, Jenny has come.

1166
01:08:08,066 --> 01:08:09,192
Why is that ghost 
going to come here?

1167
01:08:10,817 --> 01:08:12,400
Didn't come, she is standing.

1168
01:08:18,817 --> 01:08:21,650
Jenny, why have you come 
to the office?

1169
01:08:21,850 --> 01:08:22,859
Come, let's go out and talk.

1170
01:08:24,108 --> 01:08:25,409
Everyone is here, Jenny.

1171
01:08:25,609 --> 01:08:28,983
If anyone notice, it'll be wrong. 
Don't quarrel here.

1172
01:08:29,233 --> 01:08:30,442
Come, let's go out and talk. 
Come, please.

1173
01:08:30,484 --> 01:08:31,242
Hey!

1174
01:08:31,442 --> 01:08:33,242
She sent her resume 
and got selected.

1175
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:35,233
She told me not to reveal 
to surprise you.

1176
01:08:35,275 --> 01:08:37,859
Instead of coming to our office, 
will she go to the opposite building?

1177
01:08:38,059 --> 01:08:40,442
Why are you sweating 
as if you ran in Olympics?

1178
01:08:40,484 --> 01:08:41,817
Why are you making 
me tensed?

1179
01:08:44,983 --> 01:08:45,242
Enough.

1180
01:08:45,442 --> 01:08:46,400
Shut your trap 
and do your job.

1181
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:47,200
Okay.

1182
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:49,942
You didn't reveal me that 
you're going to join here.

1183
01:09:04,484 --> 01:09:08,400
Hi, baby! You could've told me earlier, 
you're going to join my office.

1184
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:11,150
Why? Are you feeling frustrated, 
I've come between your romance.

1185
01:09:11,350 --> 01:09:11,742
Hey, no.

1186
01:09:11,942 --> 01:09:14,942
I thought of celebrating your joining, 
a grandeur.

1187
01:09:15,650 --> 01:09:18,534
I saw your celebration 
in the office.

1188
01:09:18,734 --> 01:09:21,859
You're happy to see her. 
Am I like a ghost to you?

1189
01:09:21,901 --> 01:09:23,950
I went to get my phone.

1190
01:09:24,150 --> 01:09:26,675
Last night, she spoke bad 
about you, isn't it?

1191
01:09:26,875 --> 01:09:29,400
-So, I gave her a piece of my mind. 
-Oh did you?

1192
01:09:30,025 --> 01:09:32,859
-Don't act. 
-Why should I act?

1193
01:09:32,901 --> 01:09:33,734
Get out, first.

1194
01:09:34,975 --> 01:09:37,004
Ok.Shall I kiss and go?

1195
01:09:37,204 --> 01:09:39,233
Get out! 
[screams]

1196
01:09:48,484 --> 01:09:49,983
-Didn't you eat? 
-No.

1197
01:09:50,817 --> 01:09:51,317
Why?

1198
01:09:51,817 --> 01:09:53,567
I'm not hungry. 
So, I didn't bring.

1199
01:09:59,025 --> 01:10:00,859
-What are you doing? 
-Eat this.

1200
01:10:01,317 --> 01:10:02,859
-I don't want. 
-Eat this.

1201
01:10:03,983 --> 01:10:04,659
Eat now.

1202
01:10:04,859 --> 01:10:05,942
Okay, give me. I'll eat.

1203
01:10:12,311 --> 01:10:16,799
[hiccups]

1204
01:10:17,942 --> 01:10:20,233
Drink this water. 
Drink it.

1205
01:10:29,275 --> 01:10:32,442
If you drink water, 
his hiccups stopped.

1206
01:10:32,484 --> 01:10:34,442
What a medical miracle!

1207
01:10:36,192 --> 01:10:36,859
Okay.

1208
01:10:37,525 --> 01:10:40,567
If you don't have food, 
why did she give you?

1209
01:10:41,108 --> 01:10:43,358
Some problem here. 
I'll call you, later.

1210
01:10:44,275 --> 01:10:44,859
What, dear?

1211
01:10:45,609 --> 01:10:48,317
If you don't have food, 
why did she give you?

1212
01:10:48,517 --> 01:10:49,442
You must ask that to her.

1213
01:10:50,150 --> 01:10:53,233
Okay, though she gave you, 
why did you eat?

1214
01:10:53,275 --> 01:10:55,734
I was hungry. You didn't give me any food.

1215
01:10:56,317 --> 01:11:00,233
Okay, if you get hiccups 
why did she drink water?

1216
01:11:00,433 --> 01:11:01,609
You must ask her that too.

1217
01:11:02,567 --> 01:11:05,983
Okay, how did the hiccups stopped 
for you when she drank water?

1218
01:11:07,983 --> 01:11:09,358
You have to answer this.

1219
01:11:11,901 --> 01:11:14,609
How will I answer if you 
ask twisted questions?

1220
01:11:14,809 --> 01:11:15,775
Tell me.

1221
01:11:17,189 --> 01:11:19,036
[hiccups]

1222
01:11:19,236 --> 01:11:20,859
Where is the water? 
I'll drink water and come.

1223
01:11:21,901 --> 01:11:26,358
-Do I look like goof? 
-How can I myself say that?

1224
01:11:26,558 --> 01:11:27,233
Get lost.

1225
01:11:33,192 --> 01:11:34,242
Where is Jai?

1226
01:11:34,442 --> 01:11:36,358
He is lying upstairs, as he got fever.

1227
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:38,992
Where is Varsha?

1228
01:11:39,192 --> 01:11:41,108
I think, she told she is going 
to the hospital.

1229
01:11:42,525 --> 01:11:45,233
Jai has got fever but 
Varsha went to the hospital.

1230
01:11:45,734 --> 01:11:46,859
What a funny world!

1231
01:11:55,150 --> 01:11:58,442
Sir, is it a love failure? 
You're boozing at sunset.

1232
01:11:58,859 --> 01:12:01,650
-Be quiet. 
-I've seen everything.

1233
01:12:02,150 --> 01:12:04,450
You got fever and 
she went to the hospital.

1234
01:12:04,650 --> 01:12:07,358
She went to the hospital 
and you're boozing here.

1235
01:12:07,558 --> 01:12:09,734
What's this? 
Is it eternal love?

1236
01:12:09,934 --> 01:12:11,442
Why are you blabbing?

1237
01:12:11,484 --> 01:12:13,442
She went to the hospital 
as her mother isn't well.

1238
01:12:13,484 --> 01:12:14,358
How do you know?

1239
01:12:14,734 --> 01:12:15,942
Are you both sharing 
the informations?

1240
01:12:16,142 --> 01:12:17,192
She told in the office.

1241
01:12:17,650 --> 01:12:19,442
Are you going to office 
to talk with her?

1242
01:12:19,642 --> 01:12:22,025
Only you can connect 
like this?

1243
01:12:22,066 --> 01:12:24,817
-I'm saying since you've connection. 
-Hey, get lost.

1244
01:12:27,525 --> 01:12:30,025
You're crossing the limits. 
I too will be enraged.

1245
01:12:30,066 --> 01:12:32,400
-If enraged? 
-I'll go away by walk.

1246
01:12:33,025 --> 01:12:34,108
Are you knocking 
down my beer?

1247
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:34,859
I'll take your beer.

1248
01:12:47,275 --> 01:12:48,817
Hey, why are you sitting here?

1249
01:12:50,108 --> 01:12:51,859
Henceforth, this is my cabin. 
You go to your place.

1250
01:12:52,059 --> 01:12:52,609
Why?

1251
01:12:53,192 --> 01:12:54,717
Can everything be conveyed to you?

1252
01:12:54,917 --> 01:12:56,442
So, don't you like to sit by my side?

1253
01:12:56,484 --> 01:12:57,775
Nothing like that.

1254
01:12:58,192 --> 01:12:58,617
Okay, come. Let's go.

1255
01:12:58,817 --> 01:13:00,400
-What are you doing? 
-Then, tell me.

1256
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:01,025
Tell me.

1257
01:13:01,066 --> 01:13:05,192
-Leave me. 
-Tell me.

1258
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:19,317
Hey, I need to talk to you alone.

1259
01:13:19,942 --> 01:13:20,609
Come out.

1260
01:13:26,066 --> 01:13:27,367
What's your problem now?

1261
01:13:27,567 --> 01:13:30,233
You want to know whether I 
love Jai or not, isn't it?

1262
01:13:30,433 --> 01:13:32,442
I thought of clearing 
this issue to you.

1263
01:13:32,484 --> 01:13:33,859
What are you going 
to clear out?

1264
01:13:34,692 --> 01:13:35,825
You hold his hand.

1265
01:13:36,025 --> 01:13:37,817
You take him to your house and gave beer.

1266
01:13:38,775 --> 01:13:40,617
Am I his wife or are you?

1267
01:13:40,817 --> 01:13:42,734
Oh, do you've doubt on that too?

1268
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:47,108
Sis...

1269
01:13:47,358 --> 01:13:49,609
I'll kill you, if you say like that.

1270
01:13:49,809 --> 01:13:52,200
I called you as sister.

1271
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:54,025
-This is also nice. 
-Damn it.

1272
01:13:54,692 --> 01:13:59,158
Sis, I thought of dealing 
this issue, smoothly.

1273
01:13:59,358 --> 01:14:03,817
But, you awakened the animal 
that was sleeping inside.

1274
01:14:04,442 --> 01:14:07,192
Next year, this day... 
Mark it in your calendar.

1275
01:14:07,859 --> 01:14:10,233
You'll see the other version of Varsha.

1276
01:14:11,066 --> 01:14:12,400
The countdown starts.

1277
01:14:25,609 --> 01:14:27,650
Baby, why did you do so?

1278
01:14:28,650 --> 01:14:31,108
When you slap a colleague 
in the office...

1279
01:14:31,308 --> 01:14:32,734
...everyone will mistake you.

1280
01:14:33,775 --> 01:14:35,609
Are you feeling sorry 
that I'll be mistaken...

1281
01:14:35,809 --> 01:14:37,233
...or for slapping her?

1282
01:14:37,859 --> 01:14:40,025
Oh, God! Why are you connecting 
everything, wrong?

1283
01:14:40,066 --> 01:14:41,650
-You're wrong, that's why. 
-Hey, it's hot.

1284
01:14:41,850 --> 01:14:42,609
I'm connecting.

1285
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:44,400
I'm not worthy.

1286
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:47,442
I saw your worthiness 
in the moving train.

1287
01:14:48,859 --> 01:14:50,233
Always saying this.

1288
01:14:50,983 --> 01:14:51,942
Move away.

1289
01:14:55,108 --> 01:14:57,158
I didn't do anything, believe me.

1290
01:14:57,358 --> 01:15:00,650
Without doing anything, 
is she challenging me?

1291
01:15:00,692 --> 01:15:02,233
She says, she'll show 
the other version.

1292
01:15:02,983 --> 01:15:04,567
Another version? 
How will it be?

1293
01:15:05,442 --> 01:15:07,192
Do you've a desire of seeing 
that version too?

1294
01:15:07,392 --> 01:15:08,442
Hey, I just asked.

1295
01:15:09,692 --> 01:15:10,734
Open the door.

1296
01:15:11,317 --> 01:15:12,233
You go and open the door.

1297
01:15:12,275 --> 01:15:14,025
We both are in feud. 
Go and open the door.

1298
01:15:14,066 --> 01:15:15,508
I'm eating food, 
You go.

1299
01:15:15,708 --> 01:15:17,150
I'll eat. 
You go and open.

1300
01:15:18,066 --> 01:15:19,609
It's a tough job.

1301
01:15:28,484 --> 01:15:30,650
Hey, why are you here 
at this time?

1302
01:15:31,275 --> 01:15:34,534
Varsha 2.0 
Okay?

1303
01:15:34,734 --> 01:15:38,025
-What are you blabbering? 
-I'm not blabbering, sis.

1304
01:15:38,066 --> 01:15:39,442
I've come to my home.

1305
01:15:41,983 --> 01:15:42,317
Hey!

1306
01:15:42,901 --> 01:15:44,025
Where are you going?

1307
01:15:45,275 --> 01:15:47,317
-Just come here. 
-Oh, is this your room?

1308
01:15:47,517 --> 01:15:48,567
Take it.

1309
01:15:49,108 --> 01:15:51,358
I'm asking you. 
Without any sense...

1310
01:15:51,817 --> 01:15:53,609
-Oh, this is my room! 
-What do you think of yourself?

1311
01:15:53,809 --> 01:15:55,025
Thank you, sis.

1312
01:15:55,484 --> 01:15:56,983
Jai, come here.

1313
01:15:58,025 --> 01:15:59,567
-What happened dear? 
-Look here.

1314
01:16:02,150 --> 01:16:05,358
-Why did you call her now? 
-Did I call her?

1315
01:16:05,558 --> 01:16:07,191
She came with her baggage 
at midnight.

1316
01:16:07,391 --> 01:16:09,025
When asked, she says 
it's her house.

1317
01:16:09,225 --> 01:16:09,783
Her house?

1318
01:16:09,983 --> 01:16:11,609
Just ask her to get out 
of my house.

1319
01:16:12,150 --> 01:16:13,950
What are you thinking?

1320
01:16:14,150 --> 01:16:15,983
Are you creating ruckus 
in my home at midnight?

1321
01:16:16,183 --> 01:16:17,400
Better take your things 
and get lost.

1322
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:17,859
Go...

1323
01:16:18,650 --> 01:16:19,233
I'll go.

1324
01:16:19,901 --> 01:16:20,742
Before leaving...

1325
01:16:20,942 --> 01:16:23,442
...shall I tell what happened after 
taking fourth beer?

1326
01:16:23,484 --> 01:16:24,525
What?

1327
01:16:28,233 --> 01:16:29,025
Just a minute.

1328
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:33,859
Jenny, she just came for fun.

1329
01:16:33,901 --> 01:16:35,650
She is ready to leave now.

1330
01:16:36,025 --> 01:16:36,908
But, it's late night.

1331
01:16:37,108 --> 01:16:38,783
Will it be good to send 
her out, now?

1332
01:16:38,983 --> 01:16:42,942
Oh, will it be good if she stays 
in our home in late night?

1333
01:16:43,609 --> 01:16:45,358
Both aren't good.

1334
01:16:46,192 --> 01:16:47,650
But, what to do?

1335
01:16:47,983 --> 01:16:49,942
Shall we send her before 
getting the milk?

1336
01:16:51,817 --> 01:16:52,525
Get lost.

1337
01:16:53,525 --> 01:16:53,983
Jenny!

1338
01:16:58,525 --> 01:16:59,859
Oh, no!

1339
01:17:06,275 --> 01:17:08,400
What would've happened 
after taking the fourth beer?

1340
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:09,534
Shall I go and ask?

1341
01:17:09,734 --> 01:17:12,983
What are you blabbering, alone? 
Shall I give company?

1342
01:17:13,183 --> 01:17:16,192
No need of your company. 
But, a small...

1343
01:17:16,692 --> 01:17:18,400
What? Are you caressing her?

1344
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:19,817
No...

1345
01:17:22,525 --> 01:17:24,567
If you go out, I'll cut.

1346
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:42,158
Hi, Jenny!

1347
01:17:42,358 --> 01:17:44,233
Would you like to have 
hot green tea?

1348
01:17:47,317 --> 01:17:48,025
Get out.

1349
01:17:48,901 --> 01:17:49,817
Why should I go?

1350
01:17:58,775 --> 01:17:59,775
Take it and go out.

1351
01:18:01,275 --> 01:18:01,950
Sis...

1352
01:18:02,150 --> 01:18:04,400
I'll kill you, if you say that.

1353
01:18:04,734 --> 01:18:07,525
What's there to talk with you? 
Call Jai, I'll talk to him.

1354
01:18:10,233 --> 01:18:11,609
Hi, Varsha! 
Good morning.

1355
01:18:11,809 --> 01:18:13,317
-Hi! 
-What?

1356
01:18:13,901 --> 01:18:15,859
Are you both enacting a drama?

1357
01:18:17,108 --> 01:18:19,442
What are you doing here, still?

1358
01:18:19,484 --> 01:18:20,617
I thought you'll leave early 
in the morning.

1359
01:18:20,817 --> 01:18:22,650
What are you doing here? 
Get up and go to your house.

1360
01:18:23,734 --> 01:18:26,233
Cool...cool...I'll go.

1361
01:18:26,817 --> 01:18:28,859
Before that, I'll tell 
what has happened.

1362
01:18:30,233 --> 01:18:34,317
Sis... I'll tell what has happened. 
You give me justice.

1363
01:18:35,066 --> 01:18:37,817
On that day, my bike was flattened. 
I was waiting to go home.

1364
01:18:38,017 --> 01:18:39,233
He asked me whether 
he'll drop.

1365
01:18:39,433 --> 01:18:39,659
Yes.

1366
01:18:39,859 --> 01:18:41,734
I thought him as friend 
and agreed.

1367
01:18:41,934 --> 01:18:42,158
Oh...

1368
01:18:42,358 --> 01:18:45,233
After reaching the house, 
I asked him to come inside.

1369
01:18:45,433 --> 01:18:45,734
Yes.

1370
01:18:46,442 --> 01:18:47,734
I asked whether he 
want coffee or tea?

1371
01:18:47,934 --> 01:18:50,317
-But, he asked for beer! 
-Yes!

1372
01:18:51,650 --> 01:18:53,859
I gave my father's beer.

1373
01:18:53,901 --> 01:18:56,108
After taking three beers, 
he asked me to kiss.

1374
01:18:56,308 --> 01:18:56,450
Yes.

1375
01:18:56,650 --> 01:18:58,025
Did I ask you to kiss? I didn't ask.

1376
01:18:58,066 --> 01:18:58,659
Only she asked me.

1377
01:18:58,859 --> 01:19:00,525
-Did she ask you? 
-No, who asked?

1378
01:19:01,484 --> 01:19:05,108
I knew then, what he will 
ask and do, if he boozes.

1379
01:19:05,308 --> 01:19:06,233
I must go to restroom.

1380
01:19:07,192 --> 01:19:07,942
You tell me!

1381
01:19:08,484 --> 01:19:11,358
I told him to go home 
as Jenny will be waiting.

1382
01:19:11,558 --> 01:19:13,734
He said, she is not Jenny 
but evil.

1383
01:19:13,934 --> 01:19:14,659
Did you say so?

1384
01:19:14,859 --> 01:19:16,734
She is telling lie. 
I never said like that.

1385
01:19:16,934 --> 01:19:19,117
-When did I say...you? 
-I was enraged.

1386
01:19:19,317 --> 01:19:23,650
I dragged him out. But, he said 
he'd leave only after a fourth beer.

1387
01:19:24,609 --> 01:19:27,650
Do you know what he did 
after taking fourth beer?

1388
01:19:30,150 --> 01:19:30,783
What's this?

1389
01:19:30,983 --> 01:19:32,400
No, the floor will be 
spoiled if I do in the house.

1390
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:32,942
That's why...

1391
01:19:35,692 --> 01:19:37,233
You've broken my trust, Jai.

1392
01:19:37,609 --> 01:19:38,025
No...

1393
01:19:38,942 --> 01:19:40,092
She isn't puking for that reason.

1394
01:19:40,292 --> 01:19:41,442
She ate something in her house.

1395
01:19:41,484 --> 01:19:42,442
Don't tell lies.

1396
01:19:42,484 --> 01:19:44,442
I too felt like puking.

1397
01:19:44,642 --> 01:19:45,442
Believe me.

1398
01:19:46,233 --> 01:19:49,108
Look sis...he made me to puke.

1399
01:19:49,859 --> 01:19:51,534
She is lying. I'm not worth it, Jenny.

1400
01:19:51,734 --> 01:19:53,525
I'm watching your worth, 
one after another.

1401
01:19:54,066 --> 01:19:55,442
Ask him, sis...

1402
01:19:56,192 --> 01:19:58,567
I was innocent but 
he has shown me...

1403
01:19:58,767 --> 01:20:03,025
...the whole world overnight.

1404
01:20:03,066 --> 01:20:04,650
It was good.

1405
01:20:04,692 --> 01:20:06,233
She is acting.

1406
01:20:06,275 --> 01:20:07,942
-Who is acting, you or her? 
-She is acting.

1407
01:20:08,142 --> 01:20:08,450
No, he is acting.

1408
01:20:08,650 --> 01:20:10,008
-She is acting. 
-No, he is acting.

1409
01:20:10,208 --> 01:20:11,567
Look at her eyes. 
She is acting.

1410
01:20:11,767 --> 01:20:12,608
No, he is acting.

1411
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:13,650
Look at her eyes.

1412
01:20:13,692 --> 01:20:15,025
Stop...stop...stop.

1413
01:20:19,066 --> 01:20:20,525
Both of you leave.

1414
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:31,775
Sis, why did you bring me 
to the hospital?

1415
01:20:32,233 --> 01:20:35,150
I must know today, whether you 
or him is the fraud?

1416
01:20:35,859 --> 01:20:36,358
Come.

1417
01:20:37,066 --> 01:20:39,983
You want to know whether 
she is conceived or not, right?

1418
01:20:40,183 --> 01:20:41,983
-Yes, doctor. 
-Give the sample.

1419
01:20:42,183 --> 01:20:43,983
Will know the result 
in half an hour.

1420
01:20:44,484 --> 01:20:44,983
Okay.

1421
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:45,983
Come on.

1422
01:20:47,150 --> 01:20:48,025
Come on.

1423
01:20:49,484 --> 01:20:50,108
Come on.

1424
01:20:52,650 --> 01:20:54,775
Doctor, what will be the result?

1425
01:20:54,975 --> 01:20:56,441
Why? Don't you know?

1426
01:20:56,641 --> 01:20:57,941
That's why, the problem.

1427
01:20:58,141 --> 01:20:59,442
How does she look like?

1428
01:21:00,775 --> 01:21:03,233
Wait in the reception, I'll tell.

1429
01:21:03,275 --> 01:21:04,025
Okay, doctor.

1430
01:21:16,942 --> 01:21:17,650
-Hello! 
-Hi!

1431
01:21:17,692 --> 01:21:19,859
Hey, get up.

1432
01:21:21,442 --> 01:21:22,358
Get up.

1433
01:21:33,442 --> 01:21:34,859
Just half an hour.

1434
01:21:34,983 --> 01:21:39,233
If the result is negative, 
you must flee with your baggage.

1435
01:21:40,734 --> 01:21:44,859
-Sis...if it's positive? 
-Will get married.

1436
01:21:45,317 --> 01:21:46,025
Then, it's okay.

1437
01:21:46,484 --> 01:21:48,025
If it's positive?

1438
01:21:48,066 --> 01:21:51,133
Why are you tensed? 
Don't I know what I did?

1439
01:21:51,333 --> 01:21:54,400
I tried to say, don't I know 
if anyone do?

1440
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:56,650
My tongue slipped. 
Don't scare me.

1441
01:21:59,567 --> 01:22:01,317
Sis...the doctor has come.

1442
01:22:01,517 --> 01:22:03,233
-Mrs.Jai! 
-Yes.

1443
01:22:05,025 --> 01:22:07,442
Sis...she called me.

1444
01:22:08,692 --> 01:22:10,859
-Congrats! You're pregnant. 
-Thank you.

1445
01:22:10,901 --> 01:22:12,983
Doctor! Will you check it again, please!

1446
01:22:14,025 --> 01:22:16,609
How many times do I check, 
it's the same result.

1447
01:22:16,809 --> 01:22:17,942
-Good job. 
-Thank you, doctor.

1448
01:22:22,734 --> 01:22:23,650
No...

1449
01:22:26,567 --> 01:22:30,192
I think the doctor is telling lie.

1450
01:22:43,901 --> 01:22:44,158
Jai!

1451
01:22:44,358 --> 01:22:45,442
Please, leave me for sometime.

1452
01:23:05,192 --> 01:23:06,233
Has Jenny come there?

1453
01:23:16,866 --> 01:23:18,312
[phone rings]

1454
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:19,942
Hello!

1455
01:23:23,150 --> 01:23:24,734
What?

1456
01:23:52,317 --> 01:23:55,025
Hello! 
I'm advocate, 'Power' speaking...

1457
01:23:55,297 --> 01:23:57,400
Raffiq scam isn't a issue at all.

1458
01:23:59,358 --> 01:24:05,025
Yesterday, I spoke to Ramnath... 
I spoke till dawn.

1459
01:24:05,066 --> 01:24:08,233
Ask Raffiq to come here. 
Let's finish the case.

1460
01:24:08,275 --> 01:24:10,859
Always blabbing on the phone. 
Hang up the phone.

1461
01:24:12,567 --> 01:24:14,742
Okay, let me come to your case.

1462
01:24:14,942 --> 01:24:18,233
If you both need divorce, 
the point must be strong.

1463
01:24:18,433 --> 01:24:19,659
Like filter coffee!

1464
01:24:19,859 --> 01:24:21,859
Will you both tell me the points?

1465
01:24:22,059 --> 01:24:22,859
Tell me...

1466
01:24:23,059 --> 01:24:23,859
You tell.

1467
01:24:24,442 --> 01:24:26,609
You came asking for divorce, 
you've to tell.

1468
01:24:27,525 --> 01:24:30,150
He had an affair before marriage.

1469
01:24:31,609 --> 01:24:33,775
-Sir, she too had an affair. 
-Good point.

1470
01:24:33,975 --> 01:24:36,734
-With whom? 
-With him.

1471
01:24:37,484 --> 01:24:38,775
-What about you? 
-With her.

1472
01:24:39,901 --> 01:24:43,025
I think they thought me 
as a goof and came here.

1473
01:24:44,734 --> 01:24:45,859
Then?

1474
01:24:46,817 --> 01:24:49,025
He'll not let me to work 
in the office.

1475
01:24:49,066 --> 01:24:52,650
At least, he'll call me 
hundred times and say "I love you".

1476
01:24:52,692 --> 01:24:55,650
Sir, when I didn't call her 
for an hour...

1477
01:24:55,850 --> 01:24:58,158
...she tortured me for a week.

1478
01:24:58,358 --> 01:25:02,025
For that, have you come 
to torture me?

1479
01:25:03,650 --> 01:25:04,117
Then?

1480
01:25:04,317 --> 01:25:06,567
He'll not eat breakfast 
kept on table.

1481
01:25:06,767 --> 01:25:09,200
-I must feed him. 
-You traitor!

1482
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:11,859
It's you who told it'll be nice 
if I bite the finger when you feed.

1483
01:25:12,059 --> 01:25:15,192
Sometimes, if there is no breakfast, 
he'll ask the finger.

1484
01:25:17,233 --> 01:25:19,567
He broke the dining table 
which I brought, fondly.

1485
01:25:19,767 --> 01:25:23,233
Did I break it? We broke it.

1486
01:25:23,275 --> 01:25:25,650
Sir, she said, it'll be different 
If we romance on dining table..

1487
01:25:25,850 --> 01:25:27,983
...and she took me from bed.

1488
01:25:28,942 --> 01:25:31,158
Sir, there is heater in the bathroom.

1489
01:25:31,358 --> 01:25:34,358
But, he'll torture me asking 
for hot water.

1490
01:25:34,558 --> 01:25:35,659
You, traitor!

1491
01:25:35,859 --> 01:25:38,775
You always say, caressing while 
taking shower will be nice.

1492
01:25:38,975 --> 01:25:40,659
What's that?

1493
01:25:40,859 --> 01:25:43,613
Sir, it's not doing everything. 
How to say?

1494
01:25:43,813 --> 01:25:46,567
Not like full meals 
but like light meal.

1495
01:25:46,767 --> 01:25:46,992
You mean, light meal?

1496
01:25:47,192 --> 01:25:49,908
Am I running a restaurant?

1497
01:25:50,108 --> 01:25:53,233
Talking about food. 
Irritating people.

1498
01:25:53,275 --> 01:25:55,442
I asked him to wear 
the boxer and sleep...

1499
01:25:55,642 --> 01:25:56,442
...but he sleeps bare.

1500
01:25:56,484 --> 01:25:57,650
Why?

1501
01:25:57,692 --> 01:25:59,233
Sir, I'm habitual of it 
from my childhood.

1502
01:25:59,275 --> 01:26:00,233
-What can I do? 
-Stop it.

1503
01:26:01,108 --> 01:26:05,025
The reasons you said 
are highly strong.

1504
01:26:05,066 --> 01:26:07,233
If you say any simple reason, 
I'll try.

1505
01:26:08,233 --> 01:26:10,859
Sir, she'll tap on my head, often.

1506
01:26:11,059 --> 01:26:12,409
You too pat on my back.

1507
01:26:12,609 --> 01:26:15,942
-Hey, didn't you bite my ear? 
-Didn't you bite my lip?

1508
01:26:16,142 --> 01:26:17,296
Didn't you pinch my cheeks?

1509
01:26:17,496 --> 01:26:18,450
Didn't you pinch my hip?

1510
01:26:18,650 --> 01:26:20,358
You bite me on my neck, isn't it?

1511
01:26:20,558 --> 01:26:21,609
You hold my bum, right?

1512
01:26:21,809 --> 01:26:23,234
What did I hold?

1513
01:26:23,434 --> 01:26:24,859
-I got it. 
-Sir!

1514
01:26:24,901 --> 01:26:26,983
I'm saying, I got the point.

1515
01:26:28,650 --> 01:26:33,859
Okay, you can't stay away from 
him even for an hour, it seems.

1516
01:26:34,059 --> 01:26:36,942
-Yes, sir. 
-You mean, yes?

1517
01:26:37,142 --> 01:26:37,859
What about you?

1518
01:26:39,108 --> 01:26:40,859
I can't be away even 
for half an hour.

1519
01:26:42,775 --> 01:26:46,258
If I file this case in the court,

1520
01:26:46,458 --> 01:26:49,361
I'll get divorced for my whole life.

1521
01:26:49,975 --> 01:26:51,025
Sir, then we'll leave.

1522
01:26:51,066 --> 01:26:51,817
Come, dear. 
Let's go.

1523
01:26:52,484 --> 01:26:53,525
I'm leaving, sir.

1524
01:26:57,150 --> 01:26:57,859
Get in.

1525
01:27:00,692 --> 01:27:01,817
Get in.

1526
01:27:02,775 --> 01:27:05,150
Hey, I told you to get in.

1527
01:27:10,192 --> 01:27:11,233
Sorry, baby.

1528
01:27:11,609 --> 01:27:12,317
Get lost.

1529
01:27:12,734 --> 01:27:13,567
You're doing too much.

1530
01:27:14,275 --> 01:27:15,650
I thought of committing suicide.

1531
01:27:16,358 --> 01:27:17,575
What mistake I did?

1532
01:27:17,775 --> 01:27:20,192
So, decided to get divorced 
and came to lawyer's office.

1533
01:27:21,317 --> 01:27:22,442
You want, divorce?

1534
01:27:23,692 --> 01:27:25,192
Then, why didn't you tell him 
about Varsha.

1535
01:27:25,392 --> 01:27:26,609
You'd have told him, isn't it?

1536
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:29,442
I couldn't reveal after seeing you.

1537
01:27:30,317 --> 01:27:34,775
Look, if you keep your face 
like a innocent, how can I tell?

1538
01:27:36,901 --> 01:27:41,859
I feel ashamed to say, the other 
woman has entered our life.

1539
01:27:42,442 --> 01:27:44,400
I didn't do anything.

1540
01:27:45,150 --> 01:27:48,192
Baby, I don't remember 
what happened in her house.

1541
01:27:48,859 --> 01:27:50,817
Then, how come the 
test result is positive?

1542
01:27:51,525 --> 01:27:54,200
Oh, no! I didn't plan anything and do.

1543
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,033
On that day, it happened 
in the train, isn't it?

1544
01:27:56,233 --> 01:27:58,734
The same way, it would've happened 
accidentally in Varsha's house too.

1545
01:27:58,934 --> 01:28:00,192
So, are we both the same?

1546
01:28:02,901 --> 01:28:05,117
Please, shall we leave this topic?

1547
01:28:05,317 --> 01:28:08,108
Give me few days time. 
Somehow, I'll clear it.

1548
01:28:09,442 --> 01:28:10,776
Don't know...

1549
01:28:11,733 --> 01:28:15,838
I can't let you go 
whatever wrong you do.

1550
01:28:18,066 --> 01:28:21,442
That's is my dear baby! 
Shall we go?

1551
01:28:27,950 --> 01:28:29,102
What Jai!

1552
01:28:29,544 --> 01:28:33,472
I thought you'll let her go 
but you brought her to home.

1553
01:28:34,566 --> 01:28:35,449
Varsha, please!

1554
01:28:36,491 --> 01:28:37,366
Sis...

1555
01:28:38,449 --> 01:28:40,200
You said If the result is positive...

1556
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:41,291
...you'll get me married.

1557
01:28:41,491 --> 01:28:44,366
Would the marriage 
be in temple or in hall?

1558
01:28:44,407 --> 01:28:45,574
Just go to hell.

1559
01:28:56,033 --> 01:28:56,991
Sorry, Varsha.

1560
01:28:58,616 --> 01:29:00,458
We both were living happily.

1561
01:29:00,658 --> 01:29:03,366
Because of me, everyone 
has got the problem.

1562
01:29:04,783 --> 01:29:08,783
You know, isn't it? 
All these happened, inebriated.

1563
01:29:08,825 --> 01:29:11,783
If this child is born, 
it's neither for you nor for me...

1564
01:29:11,983 --> 01:29:13,741
... but it was born for booze.

1565
01:29:13,941 --> 01:29:14,745
So?

1566
01:29:15,699 --> 01:29:18,658
-You go to the doctor and... 
-Go and...

1567
01:29:20,096 --> 01:29:22,821
Go and please...

1568
01:29:23,591 --> 01:29:25,678
Oh, are you saying to abort?

1569
01:29:26,533 --> 01:29:28,741
Generally, I'll not say like that 
to anyone.

1570
01:29:28,941 --> 01:29:30,491
My situation is like that.

1571
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:32,116
Please, Varsha.

1572
01:29:33,283 --> 01:29:34,747
Okay, I'll leave.

1573
01:29:34,989 --> 01:29:36,038
Straight to the police station.

1574
01:29:36,468 --> 01:29:38,699
Hey, why are you going 
to the police station?

1575
01:29:38,903 --> 01:29:40,533
Then, where should I go?

1576
01:29:40,733 --> 01:29:41,218
Hey!

1577
01:29:43,574 --> 01:29:44,166
Tell me.

1578
01:29:44,366 --> 01:29:45,908
Police station? Why?

1579
01:29:46,699 --> 01:29:47,543
Just a minute.

1580
01:29:48,825 --> 01:29:51,537
-Police station? Why? 
-To file a complaint.

1581
01:29:51,737 --> 01:29:54,449
You'll give a baby and 
you ask to abort it.

1582
01:29:54,649 --> 01:29:55,886
Do you know 
how big crime it is!

1583
01:29:56,086 --> 01:29:57,324
Do you know what the punishment is?

1584
01:29:58,533 --> 01:30:00,991
-Jai! 
-I'm coming.

1585
01:30:02,574 --> 01:30:05,116
-What's the punishment? 
-Wait, I'll ask and tell.

1586
01:30:06,574 --> 01:30:09,083
-What's the punishment? 
-Life sentence.

1587
01:30:09,283 --> 01:30:12,741
They'll juggle you between Vellore 
and Puzhal and torture you.

1588
01:30:14,866 --> 01:30:15,991
Hey!

1589
01:30:18,616 --> 01:30:21,908
She is speaking something. 
I can't understand anything.

1590
01:30:30,825 --> 01:30:33,366
Okay, ask her what's 
her final saying.

1591
01:30:33,566 --> 01:30:35,324
I'll stay in this house.

1592
01:30:38,783 --> 01:30:41,366
Okay, stay in a corner 
of this house.

1593
01:30:41,658 --> 01:30:43,374
What? Should I stay in a corner?

1594
01:30:43,574 --> 01:30:46,200
You're just a wife. I'm 
the mother of his child.

1595
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:48,658
Legally, I've more rights 
than you.

1596
01:30:48,858 --> 01:30:50,699
You've more rights, so what?

1597
01:30:51,449 --> 01:30:53,374
-Let's share him. 
-Share me?

1598
01:30:53,574 --> 01:30:57,866
-Am I a 'share auto' to share among you? 
-Sharing means?

1599
01:30:58,366 --> 01:31:01,200
Three days in your room 
and three days in my room.

1600
01:31:01,242 --> 01:31:03,783
Oh, crap! awful to hear itself.

1601
01:31:03,983 --> 01:31:06,541
-This is difficult. 
-Why?

1602
01:31:06,741 --> 01:31:08,599
If three days here 
and three days there,

1603
01:31:08,799 --> 01:31:10,658
Where should I go for 
another one day?

1604
01:31:10,858 --> 01:31:12,116
So, this is your problem?

1605
01:31:14,616 --> 01:31:15,574
Hey, leave me.

1606
01:31:15,616 --> 01:31:17,366
Seriously, I'll kill you.

1607
01:31:17,407 --> 01:31:18,875
Can't you be idle for one day, 
in a week?

1608
01:31:19,075 --> 01:31:20,783
You need three days with me 
and three days with her?

1609
01:31:20,825 --> 01:31:22,574
Do you need two people?

1610
01:31:30,158 --> 01:31:32,366
Hey, stop.

1611
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:36,200
Open the door. I'll also come.

1612
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:38,291
Hey, come by bike.

1613
01:31:38,491 --> 01:31:41,703
Why should I come by bike? 
I've a share in the car too.

1614
01:31:41,903 --> 01:31:45,389
-Sis...go to the back seat. 
-Why should I sit at back?

1615
01:31:45,589 --> 01:31:49,075
I've conceived isn't it? 
If I sit at the back, it'll jerk.

1616
01:31:49,275 --> 01:31:51,200
It's not good for the baby, sis...

1617
01:31:52,366 --> 01:31:54,200
What's this Jai?

1618
01:31:54,242 --> 01:31:55,875
What she said is right.

1619
01:31:56,075 --> 01:31:58,366
It'll jerk if she sits at the back.

1620
01:31:58,407 --> 01:31:59,491
She is pregnant.

1621
01:32:00,283 --> 01:32:01,366
You go and sit behind, go on.

1622
01:32:02,158 --> 01:32:03,116
Go...

1623
01:32:03,783 --> 01:32:04,366
What?

1624
01:32:08,491 --> 01:32:09,366
Thank you, Jai.

1625
01:32:10,908 --> 01:32:13,574
Look, all these nasty things 
should be inside the home.

1626
01:32:13,616 --> 01:32:16,699
We're someone in the office 
and you are someone. Understand?

1627
01:32:17,033 --> 01:32:18,166
Understood.

1628
01:32:18,366 --> 01:32:20,458
Jai, I'm telling you seriously...

1629
01:32:20,658 --> 01:32:24,200
...if this matter is revealed, 
I'll not be alive.

1630
01:32:35,825 --> 01:32:38,699
I agreed to work in this company 
just because of the attached bar.

1631
01:32:38,899 --> 01:32:40,491
But, not letting me to enjoy 
even for five minutes.

1632
01:32:40,533 --> 01:32:42,658
Asking for pendrive and pencil.

1633
01:32:43,574 --> 01:32:45,200
-Darling, pendrive. 
-What pendrive?

1634
01:32:45,242 --> 01:32:46,866
Darling, I gave you 
a pendrive, isn't it?

1635
01:32:47,066 --> 01:32:48,574
When did you give me 
the pendrive?

1636
01:32:48,616 --> 01:32:50,599
I gave you, last evening.

1637
01:32:50,799 --> 01:32:52,783
Last evening, we didn't meet.

1638
01:32:52,825 --> 01:32:55,283
I gave you a red colour 
pendrive in the bar.

1639
01:32:55,483 --> 01:32:56,491
In bar?

1640
01:32:56,533 --> 01:32:57,783
Then, it must be with me.

1641
01:32:57,825 --> 01:32:59,200
Don't know where I inserted it?

1642
01:32:59,242 --> 01:33:01,662
Look Jenny, Jai always does this.

1643
01:33:01,862 --> 01:33:04,283
He'll insert somewhere 
and deny it.

1644
01:33:04,483 --> 01:33:06,499
Hey, just shut up.

1645
01:33:06,699 --> 01:33:08,658
-Did you really give me? 
-You...

1646
01:33:15,533 --> 01:33:18,200
If I call, you're not responding.

1647
01:33:18,242 --> 01:33:20,116
That much busy I'm.

1648
01:33:29,033 --> 01:33:32,200
-What are you doing? 
-We spoke yesterday, right?

1649
01:33:32,242 --> 01:33:34,908
That shouldn't be simply in words. 
So, I indulged in action.

1650
01:33:35,108 --> 01:33:36,991
Dude, today's turn is this room.

1651
01:33:37,699 --> 01:33:39,432
Are you playing?

1652
01:33:39,632 --> 01:33:41,366
-No chance. 
-Why?

1653
01:33:41,407 --> 01:33:43,783
Baby, the air-conditioner 
is not working in that room.

1654
01:33:43,825 --> 01:33:46,324
How could I sleep? 
Hey, you...

1655
01:33:46,950 --> 01:33:47,870
Thank you sis.

1656
01:33:48,070 --> 01:33:48,991
Good night.

1657
01:34:28,407 --> 01:34:30,286
Dude, not feeling sleepy?

1658
01:34:30,486 --> 01:34:32,366
I'll sleep if I have a beer.

1659
01:34:33,033 --> 01:34:34,366
Jenny isn't giving.

1660
01:34:34,407 --> 01:34:36,574
Now, you want a beer, right?

1661
01:34:36,616 --> 01:34:39,283
-Will I get? 
-Just wait.

1662
01:34:42,991 --> 01:34:43,699
How is it?

1663
01:34:44,283 --> 01:34:44,908
Hey!

1664
01:34:47,283 --> 01:34:47,908
Thank you.

1665
01:34:54,283 --> 01:34:56,124
Why are you so fast?

1666
01:34:56,324 --> 01:34:59,491
Starving for two days. 
So, it's over.

1667
01:35:00,533 --> 01:35:01,200
One more?

1668
01:35:01,950 --> 01:35:04,658
-Will I get? 
-Yes, you'll get.

1669
01:35:07,825 --> 01:35:09,333
Wonder, you do magic!

1670
01:35:09,533 --> 01:35:11,283
I'll do anything for your sake.

1671
01:35:11,483 --> 01:35:12,783
It's cool!

1672
01:35:18,491 --> 01:35:20,116
It's over.

1673
01:35:24,075 --> 01:35:24,908
It didn't come.

1674
01:35:24,950 --> 01:35:26,783
It'll not come to everyone.

1675
01:35:26,983 --> 01:35:28,116
Oh, will it not come?

1676
01:35:28,316 --> 01:35:29,449
Do you want one more?

1677
01:35:30,366 --> 01:35:31,783
No, enough.

1678
01:35:31,825 --> 01:35:32,533
Why?

1679
01:35:33,075 --> 01:35:37,324
If I take more than two beers, 
I might do something.

1680
01:35:37,366 --> 01:35:40,116
-What will you do? 
-No...

1681
01:35:42,242 --> 01:35:44,449
I'll hug.

1682
01:35:45,324 --> 01:35:46,116
Then?

1683
01:35:49,741 --> 01:35:50,908
I'll kiss.

1684
01:35:51,658 --> 01:35:52,533
Then?

1685
01:35:52,574 --> 01:35:54,366
I'll lay down.

1686
01:36:04,491 --> 01:36:07,075
Sis...are you panicking?

1687
01:36:09,366 --> 01:36:11,533
It seems, you've expected something.

1688
01:36:12,407 --> 01:36:15,574
Sorry, I opened the door thinking 
as it's kitchen.

1689
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:17,533
There is no door 
for the kitchen.

1690
01:36:17,733 --> 01:36:18,491
I know...

1691
01:36:23,324 --> 01:36:23,916
Then?

1692
01:36:24,116 --> 01:36:26,599
You're saying about your love. 
Go ahead.

1693
01:36:26,799 --> 01:36:29,083
That's a short story 
in a long train.

1694
01:36:29,283 --> 01:36:31,366
It won't be good to hear, 
but, nice to watch.

1695
01:36:58,407 --> 01:37:01,116
Hey, when did you come?

1696
01:37:01,574 --> 01:37:04,075
I came at 12 o'clock.

1697
01:37:04,275 --> 01:37:05,075
She slept.

1698
01:37:06,866 --> 01:37:09,075
Good boy.

1699
01:37:18,741 --> 01:37:21,783
Don't you attend the call? 
Are you watching 'tiktok'?

1700
01:37:21,825 --> 01:37:23,991
How many times to call you? 
What do you want?

1701
01:37:24,033 --> 01:37:24,783
It's you, who called me.

1702
01:37:24,825 --> 01:37:26,699
Okay, hang up the phone.

1703
01:37:28,407 --> 01:37:30,658
-Ask Jenny to come. 
-She has taken leave today.

1704
01:37:31,449 --> 01:37:32,708
Ask Jai to come.

1705
01:37:32,908 --> 01:37:34,533
Since she took leave, 
he too is on leave.

1706
01:37:34,733 --> 01:37:35,708
Oh! no.

1707
01:37:35,908 --> 01:37:36,991
What about Varsha?

1708
01:37:37,242 --> 01:37:38,708
She resigned and went to America, 
didn't she?

1709
01:37:38,908 --> 01:37:41,533
-JD, have you forgotten everything? 
-I didn't forget.

1710
01:37:41,574 --> 01:37:44,908
You all together, perplexed me 
and made as a goof.

1711
01:37:45,783 --> 01:37:48,324
-Why are you standing here? 
-I've sent a mail.

1712
01:37:48,366 --> 01:37:50,533
-Project? 
-No, my leave application.

1713
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:52,908
Everyone take leave and go.

1714
01:37:52,950 --> 01:37:55,699
I'll sit here all alone, like 
a mad and press the bell.

1715
01:37:55,741 --> 01:37:56,583
Do you want a bell?

1716
01:37:56,783 --> 01:37:58,991
I'll manage with the 
existing bell.

1717
01:37:59,191 --> 01:38:00,491
-You can go. 
-Okay.

1718
01:38:02,116 --> 01:38:03,116
It's me.

1719
01:38:03,158 --> 01:38:04,200
Bring the bell.

1720
01:38:04,908 --> 01:38:07,283
Bring the file. 
Don't argue.

1721
01:38:13,033 --> 01:38:14,708
Hey, damn it.

1722
01:38:14,908 --> 01:38:17,116
It seems, I've to get along 
another girl to open the door.

1723
01:38:20,616 --> 01:38:22,574
-Who are you? 
-Census officer.

1724
01:38:22,616 --> 01:38:23,908
Are you Mr.Jai.

1725
01:38:24,242 --> 01:38:25,116
Yes, come in.

1726
01:38:26,616 --> 01:38:28,116
Sir, are you the house owner?

1727
01:38:28,158 --> 01:38:29,324
How do I look like?

1728
01:38:29,407 --> 01:38:30,786
You look like the house owner.

1729
01:38:30,986 --> 01:38:32,366
Sir, tell me your name. 
-Vijay.

1730
01:38:32,407 --> 01:38:33,491
I've told you already.

1731
01:38:33,691 --> 01:38:34,283
My name is Jai.

1732
01:38:34,324 --> 01:38:35,699
Tell your wife's name.

1733
01:38:35,899 --> 01:38:36,366
Varsha.

1734
01:38:36,991 --> 01:38:37,658
Thank you.

1735
01:38:38,033 --> 01:38:38,741
Jenny.

1736
01:38:40,825 --> 01:38:43,783
Sir, is she your sister?

1737
01:38:45,075 --> 01:38:45,741
Yes, my sister.

1738
01:38:45,783 --> 01:38:46,291
Hey!

1739
01:38:46,491 --> 01:38:49,075
Actually, she is her sister 
and I'm her husband.

1740
01:38:49,275 --> 01:38:50,333
Oh, is not so.

1741
01:38:50,533 --> 01:38:52,200
Sir, who is she then?

1742
01:38:52,242 --> 01:38:53,708
Sir, my name is Jai.

1743
01:38:53,908 --> 01:38:55,741
She is my wife. 
They both are like sisters.

1744
01:38:55,941 --> 01:38:56,908
I'm her husband. 
Okay?

1745
01:38:57,533 --> 01:38:59,374
I can't understand, sir.

1746
01:38:59,574 --> 01:39:01,708
Tell me, one more time. 
Who is your wife?

1747
01:39:01,908 --> 01:39:04,116
Only three people are here. 
Can't you understand?

1748
01:39:04,316 --> 01:39:05,741
I'll tell you from the beginning. 
Note well.

1749
01:39:05,941 --> 01:39:06,458
Tell me, sir.

1750
01:39:06,658 --> 01:39:08,541
I'm Jai. 
She is my wife.

1751
01:39:08,741 --> 01:39:11,283
As both of them are sisters, 
I've become their husband.

1752
01:39:11,483 --> 01:39:15,374
Sir, I'm getting perplexed. 
Tell me, slowly.

1753
01:39:15,574 --> 01:39:18,574
I'm telling you for last time. 
I'll not repeat it.

1754
01:39:18,774 --> 01:39:19,574
Note well.

1755
01:39:19,774 --> 01:39:20,574
I'm Jai.

1756
01:39:21,366 --> 01:39:23,741
As they both are sisters, 
I'm their husband.

1757
01:39:25,158 --> 01:39:29,449
Sir! Is this slow? 
Tell me, fast.

1758
01:39:31,116 --> 01:39:32,991
Sir! I'm an officer.

1759
01:39:33,033 --> 01:39:34,995
Tell me, who is your wife 
among the two?

1760
01:39:35,195 --> 01:39:37,158
They both aren't my wives. 
I'm not Jai.

1761
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:39,741
I don't want the vote. 
Better you leave, I'll take care.

1762
01:39:42,140 --> 01:39:43,991
Hey, you put this ring 
in the church, right?

1763
01:39:44,180 --> 01:39:45,200
Yes.

1764
01:39:45,492 --> 01:39:46,605
Then, you say I'm not 
your wife.

1765
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:48,916
No, you're my wife.

1766
01:39:49,284 --> 01:39:50,366
If she is the wife, 
then who am I?

1767
01:39:50,407 --> 01:39:51,245
You're wife too.

1768
01:39:51,445 --> 01:39:52,783
-Then, me? 
-You're my wife.

1769
01:39:52,825 --> 01:39:53,374
Then, me?

1770
01:39:53,574 --> 01:39:54,658
Hey, you both aren't my wives.

1771
01:39:54,858 --> 01:39:56,075
You get out.

1772
01:40:02,908 --> 01:40:03,916
It's too cold.

1773
01:40:04,116 --> 01:40:06,166
Why are you taking my shirt?

1774
01:40:06,366 --> 01:40:09,950
What is your's and mine? 
Do you know which place is this?

1775
01:40:10,150 --> 01:40:10,950
Which place?

1776
01:40:10,991 --> 01:40:12,574
Do you know which place is this?

1777
01:40:12,616 --> 01:40:13,950
I'll know, if you tell.

1778
01:40:13,991 --> 01:40:19,666
"The place where equality is prevalent".

1779
01:40:19,866 --> 01:40:22,787
This song has to be sung 
at graveyard, not here.

1780
01:40:22,987 --> 01:40:25,908
The deceased goes there, 
the drunkard comes here.

1781
01:40:26,108 --> 01:40:28,366
Why are you talking like 
an educated person?

1782
01:40:29,116 --> 01:40:31,991
I'm an educated only, grandpa.

1783
01:40:32,033 --> 01:40:34,574
-Grandpa! 
-Okay, don't feel.

1784
01:40:34,616 --> 01:40:37,916
Come on.

1785
01:40:38,116 --> 01:40:40,449
You pour out your feelings to me.

1786
01:40:40,649 --> 01:40:42,991
-I am... 
-Hey, stop.

1787
01:40:43,033 --> 01:40:45,908
If you've problem, you booze 
and recite your feelings only to men?

1788
01:40:46,108 --> 01:40:47,750
Recite to me.

1789
01:40:47,950 --> 01:40:50,766
A guy can understand the 
feelings of an another guy.

1790
01:40:50,966 --> 01:40:53,783
Why do you think us like women? 
You think us like dudes.

1791
01:40:53,825 --> 01:40:54,750
Get lost.

1792
01:40:54,950 --> 01:40:55,950
Beat the drums...

1793

1794
01:41:06,242 --> 01:41:09,783

I accepted this"

"The world war is better"

1796
01:41:13,491 --> 01:41:16,828
"I'm unable to cope with these girls"

1797

01:41:20,449 --> 01:41:23,807
"She stung my heart like a bee"

1799
01:41:24,007 --> 01:41:27,166
"She left me when I did big faults"

1800
01:41:27,366 --> 01:41:31,283
"She has blown this small fault 
and parted away"

1801
01:41:38,449 --> 01:41:41,574

"Love is a gamble played 
with the heart"

1806
01:41:56,449 --> 01:41:59,533
"It'll make you as a Joker"

1807
01:41:59,553 --> 01:42:03,574
"Tears are like Tsunami, 
which torn the life"

1808
01:42:03,594 --> 01:42:07,075
"Run away, who has survived in that?"

1809
01:42:07,095 --> 01:42:10,283
"If steamed, it's a rice savoury"

1810
01:42:10,293 --> 01:42:13,783
"If your soul is steamed, it's love."

1811
01:42:13,866 --> 01:42:17,324
"This is the philosophy 
that no one has said"

1818
01:43:16,407 --> 01:43:17,783
"And I can't..."

1819
01:43:17,825 --> 01:43:21,574
"I'm going around like the needle 
in the clock "

1820
01:43:21,658 --> 01:43:24,950
"I don't know any way to escape"

1821
01:43:24,980 --> 01:43:28,491
"The love that makes me nervous"

1822
01:43:28,511 --> 01:43:31,908
"I can't lock it up"

1823
01:43:31,938 --> 01:43:35,366

1833
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:31,009
Hi baby! 
Will you wash this too?

1834
01:44:31,592 --> 01:44:33,009
She wants share in everything.

1835
01:44:33,051 --> 01:44:34,301
But, when told to do 
the household chores...

1836
01:44:34,311 --> 01:44:35,384
...she points the child.

1837
01:44:35,414 --> 01:44:36,967
Did she say like that? 
See, what I'll do her...

1838
01:44:36,997 --> 01:44:38,592
Hey!

1839
01:44:38,622 --> 01:44:40,426
Varsha, come out.

1840
01:44:43,759 --> 01:44:44,717
What Jai?

1841
01:44:44,747 --> 01:44:47,800
You ask for share in everything. 
But not doing any chores.

1842
01:44:47,842 --> 01:44:49,967
Simply sitting in the room. 
Go and do the chores.

1843
01:44:50,967 --> 01:44:52,967
Are you telling me 
to do the chores?

1844
01:44:53,167 --> 01:44:55,301
The child will scold you.

1845
01:44:58,306 --> 01:44:59,337
Hi, daddy!

1846
01:44:59,537 --> 01:45:00,217
Sorry, baby.

1847
01:45:03,925 --> 01:45:04,426
What?

1848
01:45:05,592 --> 01:45:09,475
Whatever we speak now, 
the baby in her womb will listen.

1849
01:45:09,675 --> 01:45:14,925
If you ask her to do chores, 
won't the child scold you in future?

1850
01:45:15,125 --> 01:45:16,925
Whatever I say will be 
always right.

1851
01:45:18,592 --> 01:45:20,592
Why didn't you wash 
the utensils yet?

1852
01:45:23,134 --> 01:45:24,009
Hey!

1853
01:45:27,176 --> 01:45:29,142
Don't you've sense? 
Can't you sit carefully?

1854
01:45:29,342 --> 01:45:33,217
-Oh, affection for her! 
-No, she is a stranger to me.

1855
01:45:33,259 --> 01:45:34,426
This is for the sake 
of the child.

1856
01:45:34,468 --> 01:45:37,305
Am I someone? 
I'm the mother of his child.

1857
01:45:37,505 --> 01:45:40,342
You're the father 
and Jenny is elder aunt.

1858
01:45:40,542 --> 01:45:41,559
Am I elder aunt?

1859
01:45:41,759 --> 01:45:43,301
Okay, then let you 
be the younger aunt.

1860
01:45:43,501 --> 01:45:44,350
I'll kill you by poisoning.

1861
01:45:44,550 --> 01:45:46,592
Then, you'll be lodged 
in Bangalore prison, confirmedly.

1862
01:45:46,792 --> 01:45:47,884
Stupid.

1863
01:45:53,925 --> 01:45:59,301
Jenny, you're in Varsha's post. 
Don't know where Varsha is...

1864
01:45:59,501 --> 01:46:02,176
Why are you asking 
about Varsha to me?

1865
01:46:02,376 --> 01:46:03,392
Is she in our home?

1866
01:46:03,592 --> 01:46:05,342
He didn't ask about 
the house.

1867
01:46:05,542 --> 01:46:06,892
Why is he saying as house!

1868
01:46:07,092 --> 01:46:08,925
Look here, now you didn't 
ask about the house.

1869
01:46:09,125 --> 01:46:10,767
If you ask again, 
I'll thrash you.

1870
01:46:10,967 --> 01:46:12,800
-When did I speak about... 
-I said, don't talk.

1871
01:46:12,842 --> 01:46:14,426
When she says not to talk, 
don't talk.

1872
01:46:14,626 --> 01:46:15,350
Mad fellow.

1873
01:46:15,550 --> 01:46:16,426
-Lunatic. 
-Fool.

1874
01:46:16,468 --> 01:46:17,550
-Stupid. 
-Idiot.

1875
01:46:17,750 --> 01:46:18,184
Senseless.

1876
01:46:18,384 --> 01:46:20,675
I've never seen a worst person 
like you in this world before.

1877
01:46:20,875 --> 01:46:21,675
That's it...

1878
01:46:23,092 --> 01:46:26,550
What did I ask now, 
why are they yelling me?

1879
01:46:26,750 --> 01:46:31,217
What happened? 
It's wrong, somewhere.

1880
01:46:38,092 --> 01:46:39,009
Just a minute.

1881
01:46:45,550 --> 01:46:46,184
What's this?

1882
01:46:46,384 --> 01:46:48,509
You'll be asking token 
for toll, isn't it?

1883
01:46:48,709 --> 01:46:50,509
Today is toll free.

1884
01:46:54,009 --> 01:46:55,892
What's special today?

1885
01:46:56,092 --> 01:47:01,800
She is immensely saying about her baby. 
And you're also caressing her a lot.

1886
01:47:01,842 --> 01:47:05,217
Can she only have a baby? 
I too decided.

1887
01:47:05,259 --> 01:47:06,217
Twins!

1888
01:47:07,176 --> 01:47:10,675
In today's match, 
she should lose.

1889
01:47:10,875 --> 01:47:11,967
Play properly.

Open the door.

1893
01:48:04,580 --> 01:48:05,550
You go and open the door.

1894
01:48:05,580 --> 01:48:06,884
You go and open the door. 
Go...

You go...

1896
01:48:08,424 --> 01:48:09,800
You go and open... 
Go...

1897
01:48:09,850 --> 01:48:11,176
You're lying on the top. 
Go...

1898
01:48:11,196 --> 01:48:13,009
Will you lie on top 
and later open the door?

1899
01:48:14,592 --> 01:48:15,800
Hey, you...

1900
01:48:18,509 --> 01:48:19,217
Hi!

-Hi! 
-Hi Jenny, how're you?

1902
01:48:21,134 --> 01:48:22,392
I'm good.

1903
01:48:22,592 --> 01:48:24,009
This is my latest girlfriend, Sanghi.

Where is Jai? 
Got up?

1908
01:48:31,009 --> 01:48:32,767
Darling, I'm here, 
can't you see?

1909
01:48:32,967 --> 01:48:34,550
You'll be getting up late 
from bed, usually.

1910

-That's why, I asked.

Who is this?

1914
01:48:44,884 --> 01:48:47,176
You bring the coffee.

1915
01:48:47,884 --> 01:48:49,967
Look at the door, 
there is a board...

What's happening here?

01:49:04,675 --> 01:49:06,384
Nothing. 
Just jovially...

1919
01:49:06,568 --> 01:49:09,925
Venki has come along 
with Sanghi.

1920
01:49:10,168 --> 01:49:12,231
We both have come here 
to give the invitation.

1921
01:49:12,908 --> 01:49:16,217
But you both stranded 
like a thunder.

1922
01:49:17,078 --> 01:49:18,124
Keep there and go.

1923
01:49:18,759 --> 01:49:23,217
Since you're the perfect couple, I came 
to give the first invitation to you.

Come and get the invitation.

01:49:33,259 --> 01:49:34,759
All the best. Bye.

What happened, now?

1929
01:49:39,342 --> 01:49:41,592
I got the invitation from you.

1930
01:49:41,633 --> 01:49:44,384
The function is at 5 o'clock, right? 
We'll be there on time.

1931
01:49:44,584 --> 01:49:46,301
You look after other works. 
Go...

1932
01:49:46,501 --> 01:49:48,426
Are you insulting a friend?

1933
01:49:48,468 --> 01:49:49,517
Yeah, let it be.

1934
01:49:49,717 --> 01:49:51,592
You go distribute the invitations. 
Go on.

1935
01:49:51,633 --> 01:49:52,600
Why are you dancing and saying it?

1936
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:54,134
It's the month which 
marks dancing. That's why.

1937
01:49:54,334 --> 01:49:55,800
Will you nail on 
the other month?

1938
01:49:55,842 --> 01:49:58,217
I'm cracking blunt jokes 
and you're worse than me.

1939
01:49:58,259 --> 01:49:59,426
Go and distribute the 
invitations to all.

Hi Venki!

1943
01:50:04,967 --> 01:50:07,009
Why are you?

1944
01:50:08,009 --> 01:50:10,550
When are you back from America?

1945
01:50:10,750 --> 01:50:11,800
Hi Venki!

01:50:17,675 --> 01:50:18,967
Are you the chef?

1948
01:50:21,717 --> 01:50:25,976
This is what you had 
screamed about yesterday.

1949
01:50:26,176 --> 01:50:30,342
We're, 'live in together'. 
You people are, 'together living'.

1950
01:50:30,542 --> 01:50:32,092
What an awes...

1951
01:50:32,176 --> 01:50:33,217
Threesome.

1952
01:50:33,433 --> 01:50:35,272
Hey, it's a filthy word.

01:50:35,472 --> 01:50:36,334
Oh!

What did she ask 
and what did you say?

01:50:49,209 --> 01:50:51,559
She asked who are they both?

1958
01:50:51,759 --> 01:50:55,301
I told her decently, 
both are your wives.

1959

Actually...

01:51:10,633 --> 01:51:12,426
She yelled me badly.

1963
01:51:12,468 --> 01:51:14,350
How do you know 
that language?

1964
01:51:14,550 --> 01:51:16,221
Why do we need to know 
the language for yelling?

1965
01:51:16,421 --> 01:51:18,092
I can see her, yelling. 
Please, take her out.

Come on.

Sis...you said, our story 
must be among ourselves.

Now Venki is aware. 
How will you go to the office?

1971
01:51:55,717 --> 01:52:00,009
Sis... hereafter, are we three 
going to be in the same bed?

1972
01:52:00,133 --> 01:52:00,933
Thank you for your decision.

1973
01:52:01,550 --> 01:52:04,301
Since, I pity for your child, 
you're crossing the limits.

-You... 
-Hey!

What are you doing?

1976
01:52:07,592 --> 01:52:09,721
I was true to you, post marriage.

1977
01:52:10,468 --> 01:52:11,552
But, you...

1978
01:52:11,752 --> 01:52:12,993
You cheated on me.

1979
01:52:13,217 --> 01:52:15,010
Fraud. 
Cheat.

1980
01:52:15,800 --> 01:52:16,726
Come here.

1981
01:52:17,061 --> 01:52:19,573
Why are you doing like this? 
You've adjusted many things.

1982
01:52:19,842 --> 01:52:21,421
Why are you getting tensed 
for this small thing?

1983
01:52:21,621 --> 01:52:22,646
Is this a small thing?

1984
01:52:23,440 --> 01:52:24,735
Which is a small thing?

01:52:25,759 --> 01:52:29,017
Jenny, don't do anything, hastily.

1986

After the child is born 
and asks his father...

1987
01:52:32,167 --> 01:52:33,925
...can I tell, you've killed him?

1988

Why are you acting high?

Hey, why are you behaving 
like a psycho?

1990
01:52:39,967 --> 01:52:42,596
I just can't take it, anymore.

1991
01:52:42,796 --> 01:52:45,426
Ask her to get out 
of my house.

1992
01:52:45,468 --> 01:52:47,342
Where do you tell her to go 
in this situation?

1993
01:52:47,542 --> 01:52:49,017
Is she more important than me?

1994
01:52:49,217 --> 01:52:51,009
You both are important to me. 
What now?

1995
01:52:53,967 --> 01:52:55,101
I said by mistake.

1996
01:52:55,301 --> 01:52:56,725
No, you didn't say by mistake.

01:52:56,925 --> 01:53:01,509
You said what's in your mind. 
I can understand now.

You've planned and 
brought her home.

I'm a fool, believed your drama 
all these days.

01:53:08,550 --> 01:53:11,426
Jenny, why are you imagining 
yourself and cooking up the story?

2001
01:53:11,468 --> 01:53:17,217
I'm not going to say anything. 
This is our last night, together.

When returning from the function, 
if she is here, I'll not stay.

Now you decide, whether you 
want me or her?

I should've divorced you 
long before...

01:53:29,209 --> 01:53:30,925
That'll happen, tomorrow.

That's known to everyone.

There is another secret too.

Now you decide.

What are you saying?

2069
01:57:41,759 --> 01:57:44,226
JD, what will you do, 
if you're in my stance?

2070
01:57:44,426 --> 01:57:48,800
I'd have told wife is important. 
Okay, what are you going to do?

2071
01:57:50,051 --> 01:57:53,925
-Shall I get one more beer? 
-Hey, you can booze.

2072
01:57:54,025 --> 01:57:56,009
But, not to the extent of 
searching your inner wears...

...in the morning.

2074
01:57:57,401 --> 01:58:00,009
Then, have to search 
for life, like you.

2075
01:58:04,009 --> 01:58:05,675
JD, I'll leave.

2076
01:58:07,925 --> 01:58:10,550
-Very beautiful advice. 
-You keep it.

2077
01:58:10,650 --> 01:58:11,675
Cooling is going down. 
Have it.

2078
01:58:11,775 --> 01:58:12,334
Oh, no!

2079
01:58:24,176 --> 01:58:26,592
Where are you going?

2080
01:58:26,633 --> 01:58:29,342
Don't be afraid. 
I'm not going to commit suicide.

2081
01:58:30,342 --> 01:58:31,800
I'm going to U.S.

2082
01:58:31,911 --> 01:58:33,381
-Don't play. 
-Hey!

2083
01:58:33,759 --> 01:58:36,759
The deadline, I said is over. 
She is inside.

2084
01:58:36,878 --> 01:58:38,006
Then, I should leave, right?

2085
01:58:44,521 --> 01:58:48,564
Okay, you be with her, happily.

2086
01:58:50,699 --> 01:58:51,861
Don't worry about me.

2087
01:58:53,633 --> 01:58:55,009
I'll take care of myself.

2088
01:58:56,550 --> 01:58:58,611
Jenny, I can't live without you.

2089
01:58:58,925 --> 01:59:00,384
Then, ask her to get out.

2090
01:59:08,759 --> 01:59:10,217
Enough of sitting inside. 
Come out.

2091
01:59:10,900 --> 01:59:11,812
Come.

2092
01:59:13,134 --> 01:59:14,426
Please, get out.

2093
01:59:15,009 --> 01:59:17,176
Suddenly, if you ask me to go out, 
where will I go, Jai?

2094
01:59:17,376 --> 01:59:18,009
Go, wherever.

2095
01:59:18,717 --> 01:59:20,967
How can you have a heart 
to say this?

2096
01:59:21,167 --> 01:59:22,217
Did you forget everything?

2097
01:59:22,259 --> 01:59:25,217
I didn't forget. 
I didn't forget anything.

2098
01:59:25,259 --> 01:59:27,217
I came to your house. 
You gave me beer.

2099
01:59:27,259 --> 01:59:28,717
You dragged my shirt.

2100
01:59:28,767 --> 01:59:30,592
If you drag a guy, 
what will he do?

2101
01:59:30,633 --> 01:59:33,384
I'm also a male. 
Did I rape you?

2102
01:59:33,404 --> 01:59:36,426
If it has happened with a married guy, 
what will a good woman do?

2103
01:59:36,466 --> 01:59:39,134
Instead, you came to my house 
and disturbing our life.

2104
01:59:39,967 --> 01:59:42,092
Which wife will allow another 
woman to stay in the house?

2105
01:59:42,112 --> 01:59:45,925
She allowed you with kind heart, 
will you behave arrogant, day by day?

2106
01:59:45,975 --> 01:59:48,592
Look here, Jenny is important for me. 
Only she must be in this house.

2107
01:59:48,632 --> 01:59:49,592
You shouldn't. 
Get out.

2108
01:59:49,633 --> 01:59:50,176
Go...

2109
01:59:50,196 --> 01:59:51,800
-I'll not go. 
-Get out.

2110
01:59:51,840 --> 01:59:53,509
-Jai, don't be so rude. 
-Be quiet, Jenny.

2111
01:59:55,342 --> 01:59:57,009
What will she do to at the most?

2112
01:59:57,109 --> 01:59:58,884
Will she go to the police station 
or call me to court?

2113
01:59:59,633 --> 02:00:00,934
I'm ready to face anything.

2114
02:00:01,134 --> 02:00:03,301
Hey, you shouldn't stay even 
for a second in this house.

2115
02:00:03,380 --> 02:00:04,194
Go out.

2116
02:00:11,176 --> 02:00:11,717
Come.

2117
02:00:12,301 --> 02:00:13,675
Hey, come.

2118
02:00:13,695 --> 02:00:14,342
No, Jai.

2119
02:00:14,392 --> 02:00:16,426
Please, Jai.

2120
02:00:16,468 --> 02:00:17,967
Go...

2121
02:00:18,675 --> 02:00:21,134
Open the door. 
Jai!

2122
02:00:32,191 --> 02:00:35,345
Jai, you behaved harshly, 
to Varsha.

2123
02:00:35,545 --> 02:00:37,550
Hey, goof.

2124
02:00:38,592 --> 02:00:39,938
I'm telling you, seriously.

2125
02:00:40,384 --> 02:00:42,426
She looks pityful.

2126
02:00:42,468 --> 02:00:44,217
You too feel bad for her.

2127
02:00:44,259 --> 02:00:45,426
Nothing like that.

2128
02:00:46,259 --> 02:00:47,759
Can I ask you something?

2129
02:00:48,967 --> 02:00:50,550
You must reply frankly.

2130
02:00:51,675 --> 02:00:54,677
Before our marriage, if she had 
proposed you...

2131
02:00:55,426 --> 02:00:57,301
...you'd have married her, isn't it?

2132
02:00:59,051 --> 02:01:00,035
Maybe...

2133
02:01:00,759 --> 02:01:03,884
But, after you came into my life, 
no other girl is in my mind.

2134
02:01:04,087 --> 02:01:05,967
Love you to that extent, baby.

2135
02:01:24,794 --> 02:01:27,925
Hey, get up.

2136
02:01:29,092 --> 02:01:30,009
Come.

2137
02:01:32,631 --> 02:01:33,528
What?

2138
02:01:37,143 --> 02:01:39,217
Good morning, bro.

2139
02:01:39,725 --> 02:01:42,600
Dad is here, whom are you wishing?

2140
02:01:42,800 --> 02:01:45,888
First, we must know to respect 
ourselves.

2141
02:01:46,088 --> 02:01:48,386
Else, no one will respect. Understand?

2142
02:01:48,586 --> 02:01:50,884
Who is the fool to teach 
these things?

2143
02:01:51,084 --> 02:01:51,725
It's you..

2144
02:01:51,925 --> 02:01:53,550
Go...sleep, go.

2145
02:01:56,051 --> 02:01:57,342
Jenny!

2146
02:01:58,967 --> 02:02:00,767
-Jenny! 
-What's this Jai?

2147
02:02:00,967 --> 02:02:02,658
You go to Bombay for meeting, 
two days a week.

2148
02:02:02,858 --> 02:02:04,550
Aren't there any other people 
in the office?

2149
02:02:04,750 --> 02:02:06,976
What to do? 
JD believes only me.

2150
02:02:07,176 --> 02:02:09,717
It's a big project. 
It can be done, only by me.

2151
02:02:09,917 --> 02:02:11,675
I'll go and come back, soon. 
Okay?

2152
02:02:11,875 --> 02:02:14,217
-Bye. 
-Wait...wait...

2153
02:02:14,259 --> 02:02:16,934
This spectacles are nice on you.

2154
02:02:17,134 --> 02:02:18,675
You tell as if you're seeing just now.

2155
02:02:20,259 --> 02:02:21,301
Come back, soon.

2156
02:02:22,124 --> 02:02:24,009
-Okay. 
-Bye.

2157
02:02:24,347 --> 02:02:25,406
Bye.

2158
02:02:33,527 --> 02:02:34,456
Thank you.

2159
02:02:43,293 --> 02:02:44,925
-Hi daddy. 
-Hi.

2160
02:02:45,125 --> 02:02:46,133
How are you?

2161
02:02:46,664 --> 02:02:47,729
Come on.

2162
02:02:54,950 --> 02:02:55,825
Sit down.

2163
02:02:56,025 --> 02:02:58,342
Always, you'll kiss me 
as soon as I arrive.

2164
02:02:58,542 --> 02:03:00,342
You didn't even speak, today?

2165
02:03:00,592 --> 02:03:01,592
What happened?

2166
02:03:03,092 --> 02:03:05,426
Then, you come for two days 
in a week.

2167
02:03:05,626 --> 02:03:06,800
And also two hours late, today.

2168
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:08,009
Late by two hours?

2169
02:03:08,051 --> 02:03:09,617
For the work I do, 
you've to adjust...

2170
02:03:09,817 --> 02:03:11,384
...even if I'm late by twenty hours.

2171
02:03:11,884 --> 02:03:13,450
Should I adjust ever?

2172
02:03:13,650 --> 02:03:15,396
No, I didn't mean that.

2173
02:03:15,596 --> 02:03:17,142
Adjust to some extent.

2174
02:03:17,342 --> 02:03:20,301
If you're dubious, tell me. 
I'll divorce Jenny, immediately.

2175
02:03:21,134 --> 02:03:26,217
Shall I go and do, immediately? 
I'll divorce her this moment.

2176
02:03:26,417 --> 02:03:27,600
You think, I'm just saying?

2177
02:03:27,800 --> 02:03:30,717
If you be silent, I'll divorce her.

2178
02:03:31,338 --> 02:03:32,775
I'm going. I've started.

2179
02:03:49,967 --> 02:03:51,883
I was listening all your dialogues.

2180
02:03:52,515 --> 02:03:55,009
All these years, you lived 
cheating me, isn't it?

2181
02:03:56,311 --> 02:03:59,184
Fraud, I'm ready for the divorce.

2182
02:03:59,384 --> 02:04:00,717
Decide when it is and tell me.

2183
02:04:01,717 --> 02:04:02,702
Rascal.

2184
02:04:04,051 --> 02:04:05,134
Just five minutes. 
I'll be back.

2185
02:04:05,334 --> 02:04:05,725
Where are you going?

2186
02:04:05,925 --> 02:04:07,392
Always you give her 
the first preference.

2187
02:04:07,592 --> 02:04:09,967
Am I a servant? 
Should I compromise everytime?

2188
02:04:10,167 --> 02:04:11,217
Hey, why are you talking like this?

2189
02:04:11,259 --> 02:04:13,800
I gave up boozing for five years, 
just for your sake.

2190
02:04:13,842 --> 02:04:14,800
I don't know all those.

2191
02:04:14,842 --> 02:04:16,384
Henceforth, if you want to come 
to this house...

2192
02:04:16,606 --> 02:04:18,094
...as you said, divorce her and come.

2193
02:04:23,025 --> 02:04:24,184
Oh, no!

2194
02:04:27,319 --> 02:04:28,584
Can I get a beer?
