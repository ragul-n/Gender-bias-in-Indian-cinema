Look, one of them you took photos and gave

69
00:06:44,076 --> 00:06:47,400

00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,900
No one will sleep at home, man.
Bring your ear.

72
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,272
- Here you go.

- Oh, deliver it.
- Yes

75
00:07:01,802 --> 00:07:04,800
Shambu, how long you will eat
in a hotel?

76
00:07:05,075 --> 00:07:07,000
Since Parvati sister died ..

77
00:07:07,275 --> 00:07:09,840
..the Hotel
became the second home of the two.

78
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,593
Why not marry your son?

79
00:07:13,072 --> 00:07:14,736
You're right, Shankar.

80
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,272
Bring your ear. Not your hand, your ear.

81
00:07:19,159 --> 00:07:20,800
Despite being deaf, which
says is absolutely correct.

82
00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:22,095
What do you say?

83
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:25,071
Yes, my son is getting married, enough.

84
00:07:25,829 --> 00:07:28,000
What will happen to the bus?
Who take?

85
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:30,400
- I told you.
- One thing, Shambu.

86
00:07:30,749 --> 00:07:33,388
Before marrying your son, investigates
a little.

87
00:07:33,738 --> 00:07:36,400
Otherwise, he's wife
take him away to Mumbai.

88
00:07:36,742 --> 00:07:39,123
You'll be alone and you go
eating in the hotel.

89
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:43,171
I marry him with full honors and pomp
, you'll see Shankar.

90
00:07:43,592 --> 00:07:46,200
Kankar? What I have to Kankar?
(Kankar = Rocoso).

91
00:07:46,472 --> 00:07:49,015
- I say that Shankar is right.
- Of what?

92
00:07:49,405 --> 00:07:51,000
- You should marry.
- No no.

93
00:07:51,335 --> 00:07:52,500
I do not want to get married, Dad.

94
00:07:52,783 --> 00:07:56,000
You do not understand, it is very necessary
have a wife at home.

95
00:07:56,299 --> 00:08:00,600
It's good when she asks
what time you come home at night.

96
00:08:00,876 --> 00:08:03,500
Dad, you have long
not hear that, right?

97
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:06,000
That's right, what time to return home at night
.

98
00:08:06,309 --> 00:08:07,800
Yes, long ago.

99
00:08:08,107 --> 00:08:11,200
Why I say you should have someone at home
ask that.

100
00:08:11,462 --> 00:08:13,400
- Me? Have you gone crazy?
- Why?

101
00:08:13,692 --> 00:08:15,600
- What will people think?
- Look.

102
00:08:15,904 --> 00:08:17,700
Pratap Singh married at an age
advanced.

103
00:08:18,018 --> 00:08:19,200
The marriage of Pratap was
different story.

104
00:08:19,475 --> 00:08:23,400
Listen, different in what, Dad?
At least listen to me, Dad.

105
00:08:23,758 --> 00:08:25,525
Pratap Singh had no children.

106
00:08:25,991 --> 00:08:27,900
A man marries to have children.

107
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,100
For the children continue the line.

108
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,100
- I've got you, right?
- But I'm an only child.

109
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:34,100
- One is more than enough.
- Not enough, Dad.

110
00:08:34,373 --> 00:08:36,000
- Think ..
- Why are you following me?

111
00:08:36,343 --> 00:08:38,200
- At least let me talk.
- Talk Talk.

112
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:42,800
Dad, if I had brothers 4-5,
we would do a full orchestra.

113
00:08:43,151 --> 00:08:44,600
- What is an orchestra?
- A band, dad. Band.

114
00:08:44,952 --> 00:08:45,700
Oh, well.

115
00:08:45,998 --> 00:08:48,101
Think, "Shambu Singh Rathod
and children."

116
00:08:48,852 --> 00:08:51,200
The famous name would be around
Rajasthan.

117
00:08:52,252 --> 00:08:54,800
What of Shambu Singh Rathod and children
is good, but I ..

118
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:57,700
But I'll talk tomorrow with Uncle
Shankar.

119
00:08:57,976 --> 00:08:58,600
Shankar? The deaf?

120
00:08:58,876 --> 00:09:01,900
The betel leaf seller. The
I spoke to my marriage with you.

121
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:02,900
Well, what are you going to say?

122
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,900
I'll go ask him to find a good girlfriend
.

123
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:06,700
Good.

124
00:09:07,016 --> 00:09:10,552
Someone to care for us and I
4-5 brothers.

125
00:09:11,262 --> 00:09:14,419
And for me to prepare me a delicious
Daal (lentils).

126
00:09:16,669 --> 00:09:19,125
Someone who makes me a little
morning tea.

127
00:09:19,469 --> 00:09:21,400
What do I eat with your hand.

128
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,196
Someone to massage my head with oil
.

129
00:09:23,527 --> 00:09:25,196
Y thing buttons

And I

00:09:31,816 --> 00:09:33,016
That too.

133
00:09:33,497 --> 00:09:34,500
Okay, tell Shankar that
I agree.

134
00:09:34,842 --> 00:09:36,700
- Who? The deaf?
- Do not! The seller of betel leaf.

135
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:39,100
I get it, not the one talking
my wedding, why are you mad?

136
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:43,774
Tell him if it's dark, work,
but ..

137
00:09:44,178 --> 00:09:45,529

- Mom! Mom!
- Hey, are you talking to Parvati?

140
00:09:52,193 --> 00:09:53,358
You did not expect me to speak
with her?

141
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:57,400
Mom! Mom! Did you hear?
Look Dad plans.

142
00:09:57,719 --> 00:09:59,759
- Parvati, he provoked me.
- Nobody provoked.

143
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,400
You only put to the test.

144
00:10:01,742 --> 00:10:04,217
Mom, when you die,
he forgot everything.

145
00:10:04,742 --> 00:10:06,217
Your love, your gestures of attention.

146
00:10:08,677 --> 00:10:11,100
Here, drink water, drink.

147
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:13,900
Look, further and speaks of
young girls man.

148
00:10:14,254 --> 00:10:18,862
- Shut up!
- Calm down. Drink water, take it easy.

149
00:10:22,852 --> 00:10:25,600
He must go to Mumbai for treatment
.

150
00:10:25,878 --> 00:10:27,596
Okay doctor, I'll take it.

151
00:10:29,465 --> 00:10:33,300
This doctor is crazy!
Let doctor! I will not go to Mumbai.

00:10:33,581 --> 00:10:34,200
Dad, here.

153
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:36,300
- I will not go to Mumbai, enough.
- No Dad, you must go to Mumbai.

154
00:10:36,643 --> 00:10:37,300
Why should I go?

155
00:10:37,643 --> 00:10:38,800
- Did not you hear the doctor?
- What did he say?

156
00:10:39,078 --> 00:10:41,200
Dad said no
spit blood is a good sign.

157
00:10:41,489 --> 00:10:42,700
So you have to go to a larger hospital
.

158
00:10:42,972 --> 00:10:45,800
Your insistence
I came to this hospital, but will not go to Mumbai.

159
00:10:46,093 --> 00:10:46,800
What is the problem with going to
Mumbai?

160
00:10:47,081 --> 00:10:49,852
The problem es..el problem is
Mumbai!

161
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,816
Raghuveer  Your uncle was there and never
returned.

162
00:10:54,504 --> 00:10:56,000
I received a letter days later ..

163
00:10:56,326 --> 00:10:58,100
..diciendo They found a corpse on the streets of Mumbai.

164
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,100
- You know who the body?
- Dad.

165
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:04,466
It was the body of my brother, your uncle
Raghuveer body.

166
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,700
Mumbai is a city of stone.

167
00:11:08,363 --> 00:11:10,000
People have no
value in Mumbai.

168
00:11:10,318 --> 00:11:11,400
You separated from your loved ones.

169
00:11:11,675 --> 00:11:14,300
Even a father of his son.
She (the city) you stole from me.

170
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:16,300
You stole from me.

171
00:11:17,674 --> 00:11:19,476
Basta, will not go to Mumbai.

172
00:11:21,735 --> 00:11:25,216
Okay then still here
coughing up blood every day.

173
00:11:29,706 --> 00:11:34,374
Do not say that what I do is wrong
.

174
00:11:35,702 --> 00:11:37,776
You see how everything is falling apart
.

175
00:11:38,777 --> 00:11:42,200
Mira. He coughs secretly.

176
00:11:42,487 --> 00:11:44,365
And spits blood.

177
00:11:44,873 --> 00:11:47,600
But he he is very stubborn and says
"will not go to Mumbai".

178
00:11:48,235 --> 00:11:51,300
Not want to see a doctor,
not take drugs.

179
00:11:51,568 --> 00:11:52,700
He's my dad.

180
00:11:52,965 --> 00:11:55,905
If he were my son, I would take
ears and take him to Mumbai.

181
00:11:56,326 --> 00:11:57,800
What would require taking the medicine bitter ..

182
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,089
..durante Few days and be cured.

183
00:12:00,498 --> 00:12:03,309
Pero..pero
my words are not heard.

184
00:12:04,635 --> 00:12:05,974
No one listens to me.

185
00:12:07,622 --> 00:12:11,320
Why should I stay here
when one listens to me?

186
00:12:13,076 --> 00:12:14,101
That's why I'm leaving.

187
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:18,301
Now you keep him, you
understand any of this.

188
00:12:19,476 --> 00:12:20,731
I go.

189
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:24,700
Give me the instrument.

190
00:12:25,025 --> 00:12:29,012
- Where? Where are you going?
- To hell I go.

191
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:34,100
When I was lighting the pyre funeral
Mom you not looked.

192
00:12:34,548 --> 00:12:36,705
I do not want you dead.

193
00:12:37,475 --> 00:12:41,300
I do not want to light your pyre.
That's why I'm leaving.

194
00:12:41,676 --> 00:12:46,259
You light my pyre, even if
have to close your eyes.

195
00:12:47,031 --> 00:12:49,700
Our relationship is only
father and son?

196
00:12:50,858 --> 00:12:53,313
Our relationship is also
friends, friends.

197
00:12:54,088 --> 00:12:58,633
As a flute with its melody,
is it something that can be separated?

198
00:12:59,909 --> 00:13:02,600
You want to take me to Mumbai to
treat me, right?

199
00:13:02,924 --> 00:13:05,307
Then take me, brother.
I will go with you.

200
00:13:06,479 --> 00:13:09,706
But there
I find many young women, right?

201
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,200
You will find many young women.

202
00:13:15,768 --> 00:13:17,338
Fool! Not for me, for you.

203
00:13:19,977 --> 00:13:22,296
Nevermore you ever talk about me.

204
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:25,200
Where do I go?
I was just kidding.

205
00:13:26,182 --> 00:13:27,700
But you you scared me.

206
00:13:29,982 --> 00:13:32,200
- Never leave me.
- I will never leave you.

207
00:13:32,772 --> 00:13:36,150
I'll go with you to Mumbai, to treat me.

208
00:13:56,492 --> 00:13:58,700
Shambhu Rathod, we guarantee ..

209
00:13:59,063 --> 00:14:02,200

00:14:02,767 --> 00:14:04,000
- But on one condition.
- What condition?

211
00:14:04,267 --> 00:14:05,400
Listen to the doctor.

212
00:14:05,792 --> 00:14:07,000
Stop chewing paan
(betel leaves with snuff).

213
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:11,400
What do you say, doctor? How do you expect
sing if I can not chew paan?

214
00:14:11,844 --> 00:14:15,024
Look brother, if he continues chewing paan
, have to operate.

215
00:14:16,511 --> 00:14:18,400
Why are you stubborn? Want to die? Everything will be fine.

216
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,900
Just you accept what he says.

217
00:14:20,211 --> 00:14:22,300
I told you not to bring me to Mumbai.

218
00:14:22,725 --> 00:14:23,900
Look, Parvati. Did you hear?

219

And the next morning they ask,
"Who are you?"

Idiot!
You spilled my bottle of liquor!

507
00:37:59,691 --> 00:38:01,021
Zindagi, what are you doing?

508
00:38:01,768 --> 00:38:04,000
Please brother, let me go, my life
escape from my hands.

If you jump on the streets of this
way, and you kill yourself, then?

00:38:11,499 --> 00:38:14,000
It's my life! If I want I kill me!
Zindagi hee!

513
00:38:14,313 --> 00:38:16,600
The government keeps us here to take care of your safety
.

514
00:38:16,869 --> 00:38:19,800
If you get hit by a car and kill you,
my name would be ruined.

515
00:38:20,114 --> 00:38:22,500

If I give, how will I eat?

530
00:38:58,979 --> 00:39:02,200
- Do not give it to me in hand!
- All right.

531
00:39:02,495 --> 00:39:04,600
I'll look the other way, you
put it in his pocket.

532
00:39:05,046 --> 00:39:06,264
So why do you say it out?

533
00:39:07,446 --> 00:39:08,900
Do not put it in your pocket,
put it in mine.

534
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:10,211
Well, excuse me.

535

Today for the first time I see someone
run to take a girl.

Brother, try to understand.
The police took all my money.

I understand that there are people so
today.

What do you think about that?
Tell me, what would Radha?

They were hypnotizing you,
biting.

I felt like killing them, felt
desire to crush them all.

Lady, artists have many fans chasing
, right?

If the news comes to my brothers,
you know what you going to do?

1010
01:10:40,326 --> 01:10:45,300
Are you trying to threaten me? I am your father! (I'm superior to you).

1011
01:10:45,626 --> 01:10:48,600
Call them, call your brothers.

How he's going to chew paan with
all of you out there?

1015
01:11:02,292 --> 01:11:05,700
Did not I tell you that
snuff aggravates the tumor?

1016
01:11:05,996 --> 01:11:07,103
Yes, I said.

1017
01:11:07,506 --> 01:11:09,900
I want the country prohibit
paan and cigarettes.

1018

Dr. Lord,
what will happen to my father?

1019
01:11:12,435 --> 01:11:13,500
I'm going to have to operate.

1020
01:11:13,844 --> 01:11:15,600
But doctor, you said it was not so serious
.

1021
01:11:15,958 --> 01:11:17,800
True, but now everything changed.

1022
01:11:18,083 --> 01:11:19,800
- But the operation ..
- Roop.

1023
01:11:20,096 --> 01:11:21,700
Your father will it improve

Make arrangements to get the
money, I'll try.

1025
01:11:24,122 --> 01:11:26,300
Will call a social organization,
maybe they can help us.

1026
01:11:26,606 --> 01:11:28,158
- But ..
- Do not worry, everything will be fine.

1027
01:11:28,661 --> 01:11:32,500
Pooja, we have very little time.
I have to operate tomorrow.

1028
01:11:32,828 --> 01:11:33,865
Yes, doctor.

1029
01:11:34,768 --> 01:11:37,500
I'm going to raise the money, you
make arrangements to operate.

1030
01:11:37,929 --> 01:11:40,849
What do you look? I have nothing, look.

1031
01:11:41,252 --> 01:11:43,500
Today Mr. can not see it.

1032
01:11:43,768 --> 01:11:46,000
How do not I see it?
It's very important.

1033
01:11:46,294 --> 01:11:48,166
- He called me here.
- But he can not see it.

1034
01:11:48,468 --> 01:11:50,300
- No, let me see it.
- Where are you going?

1035
01:11:50,620 --> 01:11:53,410
Lord Patel, his men are
misbehaving.

1036
01:11:54,618 --> 01:11:57,577
Sorry, but what happened?

1037
01:11:59,088 --> 01:12:01,331
- Get out of here.
- That I leave?

1038
01:12:01,733 --> 01:12:05,700
- Lord Patel, you quote me here.
- Yes, you cite.

1039
01:12:05,969 --> 01:12:07,500
You wanted me to sing in his hotel
.

1040
01:12:07,782 --> 01:12:10,000
- Yes, I wanted you to sing.
- So what happened?

1041
01:12:10,269 --> 01:12:12,000
- My voice is bad?
- No, is not that.

1042
01:12:12,353 --> 01:12:15,210
- So what's the problem?
- Ask Narang!

1043
01:12:17,525 --> 01:12:18,700
Why involves Narang on this?

1044
01:12:19,034 --> 01:12:19,800
Get out!

1045
01:12:20,143 --> 01:12:22,900
Why I should ask him
about what we talked about?

1046
01:12:23,162 --> 01:12:23,600
Get out!

1047
01:12:23,865 --> 01:12:25,043
Lord, I'm upset, wait.

1048
01:12:25,447 --> 01:12:26,854
Wait.

1049
01:12:27,561 --> 01:12:31,927
Cuñada ji, my father is very ill in hospital
.

1050
01:12:33,135 --> 01:12:35,359
I want the money for
treatment.

1051
01:12:36,267 --> 01:12:38,006
Lord, I came with high expectations.

1052
01:12:38,614 --> 01:12:40,361
Do not do that to me, sir.

1053
01:12:41,077 --> 01:12:43,089
Do not do that to me, sir.

1054
01:12:44,691 --> 01:12:46,470
- I can do this!
- What are you doing?

1055
01:12:46,774 --> 01:12:49,300
- I can do this!
- What happens?

1056
01:12:49,632 --> 01:12:50,300
What are you doing?

1057
01:12:50,571 --> 01:12:54,400
I'm doing exactly what
Narang will do to them both!

1058
01:12:54,736 --> 01:12:56,000
What do you want?

1059
01:12:56,278 --> 01:12:58,400
What my wife and widow becomes orphaned
leave my child?

1060
01:12:58,662 --> 01:12:59,600
No.

1061
01:12:59,939 --> 01:13:05,660
Look, if you want your sake and mine
do whatever you want Narang.

1062
01:13:05,987 --> 01:13:07,200
God gives us life.

1063
01:13:07,495 --> 01:13:11,091
But Narang gives us the right to live
or not.

1064
01:13:11,795 --> 01:13:15,459
No one can do anything, not even the police
.

1065
01:13:16,666 --> 01:13:19,300
By God, please, get out!

1066
01:13:19,585 --> 01:13:24,100
Go, have mercy on my wife and my child
! Get out of here!

1067
01:13:24,416 --> 01:13:26,700
- For the love of God, go!
- Yes

1068
01:13:26,973 --> 01:13:31,040
- I beg you, please go.
- Put me down.

1069
01:13:36,964 --> 01:13:39,900
No, no money I can not operate
to Shambu Rathore.

1070
01:13:40,321 --> 01:13:41,800
We'll get the 10,000Rs is two days.

1071
01:13:42,134 --> 01:13:44,000
Try to understand Pooja.

1072
01:13:44,318 --> 01:13:45,900
There are many other poor patients.

1073
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:49,200
Even if I operate thanks to you,
how others feel?

1074
01:13:49,474 --> 01:13:51,200
- Sir, please!
- I'm sorry, Pooja.

1075
01:13:51,635 --> 01:13:53,943
They'll have to get all the money
and fast.

1076
01:14:11,972 --> 01:14:16,365
Do not look at me.
I have nothing to offer.

1077
01:14:17,169 --> 01:14:19,128
Totally empty, look.

1078
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:23,254
I do not understand
why are you doing this?

1079
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:27,051
You know the state in which
is my father, right?

1080
01:14:35,792 --> 01:14:39,250
Let me tell you what you're doing is
not at all well.

1081
01:14:41,189 --> 01:14:42,481
It's not right.

1082
01:15:00,394 --> 01:15:02,244
So you're on the street.

1083
01:15:05,664 --> 01:15:09,799
Why
someone looking for something that is not on the street?

1084
01:15:10,306 --> 01:15:12,900
If you want something, ask someone
that is above.

1085
01:15:13,226 --> 01:15:15,311
Someone who can give you something.

1086
01:15:20,443 --> 01:15:25,312
You know what
reason behind every war?

1087
01:15:26,620 --> 01:15:27,738
Love.

1088
01:15:28,626 --> 01:15:29,633
Love.

1089
01:15:31,663 --> 01:15:36,598
If there is love, that drives us to
fight each other.

1090
01:15:37,705 --> 01:15:42,246
And in war, who it is strong
wins.

1091
01:15:43,856 --> 01:15:48,300
Is that a threat?
What does it mean? Speak clearly!

1092
01:15:51,445 --> 01:15:53,324
Do not be innocent.

1093
01:15:54,935 --> 01:15:57,257
You know what I mean.

1094
01:16:01,592 --> 01:16:03,869
You need money.

1095
01:16:04,276 --> 01:16:06,834
This mere offer of God will be low.

1096
01:16:11,161 --> 01:16:13,600
Hey, Narang! I do not want your money!

1097
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:18,100
Hey, Narang! Wait!
I do not want your money!

1098
01:16:18,406 --> 01:16:23,730
I have the blessing of God!
I will not go with you! Hey, Narang!

1099
01:17:17,282 --> 01:17:24,421
<i>Oh, loneliness of the heart, oh.</i>

1100
01:17:25,379 --> 01:17:31,830
<i>I make the solitude of my heart
my voice.</i>

1101
01:17:35,924 --> 01:17:41,467
<i>When pain crosses his limits,
then I start to sing.</i>

1102
01:17:41,904 --> 01:17:48,000
<i>When pain crosses his limits,
then I start to sing.</i>

1103
01:17:48,289 --> 01:17:54,438
<i>I make the solitude of my heart
my voice.</i>

1104
01:17:57,353 --> 01:18:03,000
<i>When pain crosses his limits,
then I start to sing.</i>

1105
01:18:03,294 --> 01:18:08,968
<i>When pain crosses his limits,
then I start to sing.</i>

1106
01:18:09,678 --> 01:18:12,335
<i>Yes, singing.</i>

1107
01:18:15,463 --> 01:18:18,388
<i>Yes, singing.</i>

1108
01:18:59,956 --> 01:19:01,808
Volviste, Roop?

1109
01:19:04,625 --> 01:19:05,803
Yes.

1110
01:19:08,318 --> 01:19:12,240
It seems as if suddenly the whole city
had become deaf.

1111
01:19:15,047 --> 01:19:17,684
No one is willing to listen to my voice.

1112
01:19:25,894 --> 01:19:30,921
With all conditions
city, now you accept mine?

1113
01:19:33,842 --> 01:19:34,689
Yes.

1114
01:19:37,608 --> 01:19:42,812
Starting today  voice Roop Singh Rathore
only belongs to you.

1115
01:19:44,020 --> 01:19:45,640
And Roop?

1116
01:19:49,163 --> 01:19:50,441
He also .

1117
01:19:52,663 --> 01:19:53,641
Oh, Roop.

1118
01:19:56,379 --> 01:19:58,107
Reshma ji.

1119
01:20:00,015 --> 01:20:03,807
I need one thing.

1120
01:20:05,719 --> 01:20:06,997
Do not worry, Roop.

1121
01:20:07,905 --> 01:20:11,325
My brother can give any
thing in this world.

1122
01:20:11,979 --> 01:20:15,600
A car, a bungalow, money for the operation
your father.

1123
01:20:15,905 --> 01:20:17,100
You can give anything.

1124
01:20:17,429 --> 01:20:21,153
Yes! I can now give you whatever you ask
.

1125
01:20:22,162 --> 01:20:25,753
High above
your expectations and dreams.

1126
01:20:27,265 --> 01:20:30,628
Reshma To be happy, I can
to give up myself.

1127
01:20:32,134 --> 01:20:33,211
Yes, sir.

1128
01:20:34,421 --> 01:20:37,379
So far
I never saw a brother who loves both her sister.

1129
01:20:38,185 --> 01:20:41,330
So I am happy while
see her happy.

1130
01:20:42,488 --> 01:20:45,200
At the same time, I feel a little fear
too.

1131
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:46,546
Fear?

1132
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:50,721
What a jinx end its
happiness.

1133
01:20:53,684 --> 01:20:55,870
Come, I'll show you something.

1134
01:21:05,076 --> 01:21:07,188
Come on in.

1135
01:21:13,435 --> 01:21:16,280
What is this place that brought me
, sir?

1136
01:21:16,799 --> 01:21:19,717
I did not want you here, but I had no choice
.

1137
01:21:22,839 --> 01:21:23,810
I do not understand.

1138
01:21:26,898 --> 01:21:29,200
I brought you here so you can understand.

1139
01:21:30,743 --> 01:21:34,700
You're not the first man in life
Reshma.

1140
01:21:37,728 --> 01:21:39,703
There was someone before you.

1141
01:21:41,451 --> 01:21:45,326
A handsome young man like you.

1142
01:21:46,859 --> 01:21:49,181
Reshma was crazy about him.

1143
01:21:52,224 --> 01:21:55,458
I used to be as happy as it is today.

1144
01:21:56,884 --> 01:22:02,544
She always had a smile on his face
and twinkle in his eyes.

1145
01:22:03,871 --> 01:22:06,688
And then one day when I arrived at her house
, she was crying.

1146
01:22:08,733 --> 01:22:11,340
I can bear to see everything.

1147
01:22:13,475 --> 01:22:18,704
Death, corpses, blood,
houses burning, people being beaten.

1148
01:22:19,725 --> 01:22:22,424
But I can not see my sister
crying.

1149
01:22:26,715 --> 01:22:28,327
My sister had tears in her eyes.

1150
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:32,809
Her husband was the one who had done
mourn.

1151
01:22:36,091 --> 01:22:39,253
Why did you use a Mangalsutra
my sister? (to marry).

1152
01:22:40,187 --> 01:22:42,442
Why did you use?
Why?

1153
01:22:43,870 --> 01:22:47,370
There were tears in the eyes of
my sister!

1154
01:22:48,607 --> 01:22:51,345
Why did you mourn my sister?

1155
01:22:55,423 --> 01:22:58,224
Blood stains it
are still here.

1156
01:22:59,856 --> 01:23:01,460
This is where fell.

1157
01:23:03,203 --> 01:23:06,382
I had to do
mourn my sister, the damn dog.

1158
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:08,703
Here he died.

1159
01:23:10,700 --> 01:23:11,703
You ..

1160
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:15,303
..no The do mourn.

1161
01:23:17,283 --> 01:23:18,331

..the Do mourn.

1163
01:23:37,629 --> 01:23:39,251
How are you, Dad?

1164
01:23:41,716 --> 01:23:43,319
You can return to sing.

1165
01:23:53,239 --> 01:23:54,736
Do not say those things, Dad.

1166
01:23:55,353 --> 01:23:57,600
We played 50 runs, but the game is not over
.

1167
01:23:57,881 --> 01:24:01,100
What if he dropped a catch?
We have to run 100 more.

1168
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:03,400
Brother, it seems you saw the game yesterday
cricket.

1169
01:24:03,699 --> 01:24:05,542
Yes, Sachin Tendulkar gave me a ticket.

1170
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:09,432
Shambu, Shambu, so good, right?

1171
01:24:09,949 --> 01:24:13,000
's Better than Dad do not laugh
So come on, okay?

1172
01:24:13,460 --> 01:24:15,243
Roop. Roop, you too.

1173
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:27,400
Hey! Why are you so worried?

1174
01:24:27,747 --> 01:24:29,100
Now everything is fine.

1175
01:24:29,490 --> 01:24:32,400
Let's go celebrate the hotel.
Come on let's go.

1176
01:24:34,263 --> 01:24:36,653
- I want to show you one thing.
- What?

1177
01:24:41,870 --> 01:24:45,100
It's very beautiful, whose is it?

1178
01:24:46,432 --> 01:24:47,657
's Mine.

1179
01:24:49,296 --> 01:24:50,439
Really?

1180
01:24:52,371 --> 01:24:54,340
You made all the arrangements.

1181
01:24:54,849 --> 01:24:56,177
So you bought a house.

1182
01:24:56,592 --> 01:24:57,633
What more do you want?

1183
01:24:59,578 --> 01:25:04,577
There's a boyfriend, there is a girlfriend,
there is a house.

1184
01:25:05,951 --> 01:25:07,561
Is our love.

1185
01:25:11,061 --> 01:25:12,256
We celebrate.

1186
01:25:15,221 --> 01:25:17,600
But tell me, how did you
this beautiful home?

1187
01:25:17,946 --> 01:25:19,274
Where did you get the money?

1188
01:25:21,306 --> 01:25:23,551
Hey! ¿Roop?

1189
01:25:27,453 --> 01:25:29,406
All I had ..

1190
01:25:34,472 --> 01:25:36,240
..vendí Everything I had, Pooja.

1191
01:25:37,174 --> 01:25:40,284
What? What did you sell?

1192
01:25:45,185 --> 01:25:46,291
Myself.

1193
01:25:50,265 --> 01:25:51,642
My voice.

1194
01:25:54,807 --> 01:25:55,600
In our ..

1195
01:25:56,848 --> 01:25:58,253
..to Our love.

1196
01:26:05,710 --> 01:26:09,707
When I was little, I heard the story of Shravan Kumar
(Ramayana).

1197
01:26:11,448 --> 01:26:15,156
Who sacrificed his life for his parents.

1198
01:26:17,305 --> 01:26:22,323
But I never thought I would have a Shravan also
in my life.

1199
01:26:26,310 --> 01:26:28,363
My debt to you increase even more.

1200
01:26:32,768 --> 01:26:35,346
Just do me a favor.

1201
01:26:39,947 --> 01:26:42,400
When I close my eyes ..

1202
01:26:44,765 --> 01:26:46,202
..vete Here.

1203
01:27:17,249 --> 01:27:19,473
Pooja, Pooja.

1204
01:27:20,949 --> 01:27:22,473
Pooja  Please do not cry.

1205
01:27:24,196 --> 01:27:26,332
Answer me, Pooja.

1206
01:27:28,995 --> 01:27:31,248
You and Roop much love, right?

1207
01:27:33,841 --> 01:27:37,462
So how did this happen?

1208
01:27:39,805 --> 01:27:44,308
Roop is desperate, Raja.
He needs our help.

1209
01:27:45,467 --> 01:27:47,908
Will you help me save him?

1210
01:27:49,653 --> 01:27:51,228
I can not do anything for him.

1211
01:27:51,741 --> 01:27:54,706
But I can do anything for the person I love
.

1212
01:27:56,138 --> 01:27:58,659
- Would you marry me?
- What?

1213
01:27:59,979 --> 01:28:02,600
What are you saying? Have you gone crazy?

1214
01:28:02,995 --> 01:28:06,318
Raja, if I do not take the attitude and I marry you ..

1215
01:28:07,497 --> 01:28:09,711
..Roop Never be able to forget.

1216
01:28:10,526 --> 01:28:16,286
My love and think of me
not let live in peace, Raja.

1217
01:28:16,601 --> 01:28:18,266
I want to release it.

1218
01:28:19,394 --> 01:28:21,267
Will you help me?

1219
01:28:23,217 --> 01:28:27,190
Will you help me, please? Will you help me?

1220
01:28:28,222 --> 01:28:32,200
Pooja, I'll do anything to be happy
.

1221
01:28:32,517 --> 01:28:33,238
Whatever.

1222
01:28:41,886 --> 01:28:44,600
- Bhaaji Rao.
- Again, how many times I tell you?

1223
01:28:44,907 --> 01:28:47,400
My name is Bhaaji Rao Ganpatrao
Hatmare.

1224
01:28:47,742 --> 01:28:51,000
Shorten the name
reduces the prestige of man.

1225
01:28:51,265 --> 01:28:52,352
Tell me, what is the task?

1226
01:28:53,766 --> 01:28:57,600
I do not see Pooja for about
days ago, she left?

1227
01:28:57,913 --> 01:29:00,660
No. She comes to the hospital, but no
comes to this wing.

1228
01:29:01,909 --> 01:29:04,326
It seems that she and Roop had
a fight.

1229
01:29:04,854 --> 01:29:08,433
Bhaaji Rao discovers is happening.

1230
01:29:09,866 --> 01:29:11,200
I'll give 5Rs.

1231
01:29:11,565 --> 01:29:12,900
- 5Rs?
- Yes

1232
01:29:13,230 --> 01:29:17,723
Shambu for this job you get paid anything
ti..no.

1233
01:29:48,294 --> 01:29:49,745
What are you thinking?

1234
01:29:51,632 --> 01:29:56,853
I was thinking Mr. Narang
when I sang well ..

1235
01:29:57,964 --> 01:30:00,721
..I I used to keep my head high while singing
.

1236
01:30:02,245 --> 01:30:04,475
But now, after reaching such a level
..

1237
01:30:05,651 --> 01:30:08,752
..tengo To lower his eyes to look at those guys
.

1238
01:30:12,088 --> 01:30:16,467
Can I say one thing, Mr.
Narang? After all ..

1239
01:30:17,978 --> 01:30:20,373
..¿por What
still I feel envious look at those guys?

1240
01:30:22,114 --> 01:30:26,261
For someone to win something, you lose something
, Roop.

1241
01:30:26,373 --> 01:30:29,438
Roop, what are you doing here?
We have to go on stage.

1242
01:30:29,847 --> 01:30:31,389
Showtime.

1243
01:30:31,900 --> 01:30:35,884

<i>Neither the desert nor by the people.</i>

1251
01:31:56,757 --> 01:31:59,700

1252
01:31:59,968 --> 01:32:02,500
<i>Without you, without you.</i>

1253
01:32:02,768 --> 01:32:06,100
<i>Without you, without you.</i>

1254
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:09,500

<i>Heart, heart, does not care

1259
01:32:28,166 --> 01:32:31,200
<i>If I stay at home, my heart is weakened
.</i>

1260
01:32:31,477 --> 01:32:34,300
<i>When I'm out it rises.</i>

1261
01:32:34,578 --> 01:32:37,400
<i>Wherever I go, wherever I look ..</i>

1262

How long?

1322
01:36:59,410 --> 01:37:01,323
That guy should feel ashamed of himself!

1323
01:37:06,936 --> 01:37:10,072
- Bhaaji Rao, where is my father?
- Do not talk to me.

1324
01:37:11,774 --> 01:37:14,119
- Tell me, where is Dad?
- I told you I do not speak.

1325

Hey, where's my dad?

Mrs. Wadia, tell me, where is Dad?

1328
01:37:25,480 --> 01:37:28,596
Why do we ask where he is?
He went to his people.

1329
01:37:29,097 --> 01:37:32,100
He left us all.
Newly went to the station.

1330
01:37:32,504 --> 01:37:35,300
You are a very bad man!
All happened because of you.

01:37:35,719 --> 01:37:36,903
You are a very bad man!

1332
01:37:37,657 --> 01:37:38,959

What happened?

1336
01:38:33,180 --> 01:38:35,726
You're asking me what happened?

1337
01:38:36,647 --> 01:38:38,019
Ask them.

1338
01:38:39,622 --> 01:38:42,800
Go ask those who bought
your voice.

1339
01:38:43,529 --> 01:38:47,377
Papá..papá not know what to do.

1340
01:38:50,082 --> 01:38:53,028
No one wanted to give me money to pay for your treatment
.

1341
01:38:57,276 --> 01:39:00,421
If there was no money, then
You should have let me die.

1342
01:39:02,926 --> 01:39:05,061
You do not sold, son.

1343
01:39:05,762 --> 01:39:07,676
You sold our dreams.

1344
01:39:09,278 --> 01:39:12,254
You sold last wish
your mother.

1345
01:39:13,658 --> 01:39:17,134
You sold an ancestral profession.
Outta my hand go.

1346
01:39:18,767 --> 01:39:21,582
- At least hear me, Dad.
- I do not want to hear.

1347
01:39:24,785 --> 01:39:26,661
I do not even want to see your face.

1348
01:39:27,263 --> 01:39:29,467
Rather I die than look at you.

1349
01:39:32,273 --> 01:39:35,289
- I was desperate, Dad.
- Feel my despair too.

1350
01:39:38,991 --> 01:39:41,099
So tell me what I should do.

1351
01:39:43,905 --> 01:39:47,400
When
before and you took the decision for yourself.

1352
01:39:47,753 --> 01:39:51,100
Decídelo  Now you too.
Get out! Get out! Get out!

1353
01:40:17,921 --> 01:40:18,900
Roop?

1354
01:40:19,421 --> 01:40:20,300
Roop!

1355
01:40:21,921 --> 01:40:22,600
Hello.

1356
01:40:22,921 --> 01:40:24,200
What are you doing?

1357
01:40:24,521 --> 01:40:26,300
I'll leave the city and return to
my people.

1358
01:40:26,626 --> 01:40:32,300
- Very good. I will go with you.
- No, you can not come with me.

1359
01:40:32,648 --> 01:40:35,664
Why? Why?
Why I can not go with you?

1360
01:40:36,465 --> 01:40:41,345
- Because I'll go with Pooja.
- Pooja? Who is Pooja?

1361
01:40:42,347 --> 01:40:44,150
Pooja is my love.

1362
01:40:44,751 --> 01:40:48,128
I decided to spend the rest of my life
with Pooja.

1363
01:40:49,931 --> 01:40:51,503
I do not like.

1364
01:40:52,242 --> 01:40:53,800
I do not like to play with me.

1365
01:40:54,109 --> 01:40:56,283
You are the only one who is playing with me
!

1366
01:40:56,784 --> 01:40:59,199
You do not love me, you negotiate
love!

1367
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:01,433
Reshma ji, love is not defenseless.

1368
01:41:01,900 --> 01:41:03,700
Love is a beautiful gift from God.

1369
01:41:04,015 --> 01:41:05,798
That only the receipt of Pooja.

1370
01:41:07,612 --> 01:41:11,045
Again Pooja, who is Pooja?

1371
01:41:12,360 --> 01:41:15,851
What has that Pooja I do not have?

1372
01:41:20,791 --> 01:41:23,380
She has nothing
what you have.

1373
01:41:24,589 --> 01:41:29,260
She is not rich like you, nor
so arrogant.

1374
01:41:30,070 --> 01:41:32,425
She also tries to buy love.

1375
01:41:32,831 --> 01:41:34,886
She does not play with the heart of
people.

1376
01:41:36,331 --> 01:41:37,386
Do you know?

1377
01:41:38,399 --> 01:41:42,100
When I was desperate and
pawned my love with you ..

1378
01:41:42,499 --> 01:41:44,500
Should have something, in this house ..

1379
01:41:46,110 --> 01:41:48,126
..ella Not complain.

1380
01:41:49,941 --> 01:41:55,316
Now
understand what the difference between you and my Pooja?

1381
01:41:56,632 --> 01:41:58,785
You're wrong, Roop.

1382
01:41:59,947 --> 01:42:04,579
I did all this because I love you.

1383
01:42:05,338 --> 01:42:08,200
No girl can love you as much as I love you
.

1384
01:42:08,472 --> 01:42:10,182
Nobody loves you as much as me!

1385
01:42:10,991 --> 01:42:13,909
I can not share you with no
else.

1386
01:42:15,021 --> 01:42:19,158
Look at me, look into my eyes.

1387
01:42:20,465 --> 01:42:23,226
I love you, Roop. I love you.

1388
01:42:24,737 --> 01:42:27,325
I love you more than anything in this world.

1389
01:42:28,532 --> 01:42:29,244
Lie!

1390
01:42:30,450 --> 01:42:33,470
You do not understand that love
can buy!

1391
01:42:34,380 --> 01:42:37,037
Love is not available on the market
, lady!

1392
01:42:37,647 --> 01:42:41,170
First you must learn to love herself
, Reshma ji!

1393
01:42:41,876 --> 01:42:44,002
After that, expect love in return.

1394
01:42:46,288 --> 01:42:48,573
- Where are you going?
- Enough, enough Reshma ji.

1395
01:42:49,030 --> 01:42:50,200
Now let me go.

1396
01:42:50,554 --> 01:42:53,917
Forgive me if what I said offended.
Let me go.

1397
01:42:54,523 --> 01:42:58,800
Bastard! Cheat!
Do not anger and leave me.

1398
01:42:59,069 --> 01:43:01,541
Lady, do not stop me, let me go.

1399
01:43:01,872 --> 01:43:05,200
Do not forget that you owe my brother and me
!

1400
01:43:05,638 --> 01:43:08,896
- Lady ..
- If you leave me, I'm going to kill you!

1401
01:43:09,707 --> 01:43:10,648
I'm going to kill that bitch!

1402
01:43:11,051 --> 01:43:14,014
Enough! Enough!
Take care of your words, Reshma!

1403
01:43:14,817 --> 01:43:17,308
If it hurts Pooja, I strangle
!

1404
01:43:18,514 --> 01:43:20,200
I strangle you!

1405
01:43:20,861 --> 01:43:24,500
It will not be able to speak again
for the rest of your life! Enough!

1406
01:43:27,451 --> 01:43:29,214
Roop!

1407
01:43:30,251 --> 01:43:32,214
Roop!

1408
01:43:37,303 --> 01:43:38,182
Detente.

1409
01:43:42,915 --> 01:43:46,100
- Brother, do you know where Pooja lives?
- Pooja is married.

1410
01:43:46,382 --> 01:43:48,500
No brother, I'm talking about
girl who works at the hospital.

1411
01:43:48,770 --> 01:43:50,700
Yes, the same Pooja.
She is getting married.

1412
01:43:50,985 --> 01:43:52,305
- What?
- What are you saying?

1413
01:43:53,785 --> 01:43:56,305
Pooja! Pooja!

1414
01:43:58,149 --> 01:44:00,300
Who are you? Why are you
shouting the name of the bride?

1415
01:44:00,649 --> 01:44:01,400
Pooja!

1416
01:44:01,779 --> 01:44:05,191
Who is he?
I'm going to break his bones!

1417
01:44:06,816 --> 01:44:08,744
Pooja, what are you doing?

1418
01:44:11,864 --> 01:44:13,580
How can you marry someone else?

1419
01:44:15,894 --> 01:44:18,323
Questioning things
no sense now, Roop. Get out of here.

1420
01:44:19,328 --> 01:44:20,238
Get out of here.

1421
01:44:20,942 --> 01:44:23,361
What I'm going where? Why should I leave?

1422
01:44:23,965 --> 01:44:25,880
My destiny brought me here!

1423
01:44:27,188 --> 01:44:30,292
Pooja, you are my destiny!
You are my life!

1424
01:44:31,900 --> 01:44:34,248
And I will not leave here without you!

1425
01:44:34,651 --> 01:44:37,211
I will not go me! I'll sit here!

1426
01:44:39,932 --> 01:44:43,197
Why do not you go?
Why do not you go? Tell me!

1427
01:44:44,908 --> 01:44:48,400
When we parted,
do you know who I support?

1428
01:44:48,810 --> 01:44:53,205
It was him! Who was the one who helped me forget
? Was the!

1429
01:44:54,022 --> 01:44:56,741
And now you come back and ask me
to leave everything to run away with you?

1430
01:44:57,434 --> 01:44:59,984
Why Roop? Because you love me.

1431
01:45:00,939 --> 01:45:03,496
For you, love and marriage
does not mean anything, right?

1432
01:45:04,104 --> 01:45:06,497
But now in my life
another man entered.

1433
01:45:07,502 --> 01:45:10,967
And this good and decent man loves me
much.

1434
01:45:12,075 --> 01:45:13,214
Should I betray him?

1435
01:45:14,020 --> 01:45:16,620
Should I insult everyone who came here to bless
?

1436
01:45:17,627 --> 01:45:20,304
Should I take your hand and run
you? Tell me!

1437
01:45:20,710 --> 01:45:23,490
No! Do not!

1438
01:45:24,510 --> 01:45:25,590
You're right, Pooja.

1439
01:45:27,401 --> 01:45:29,248
This is your place.

1440
01:45:29,860 --> 01:45:32,282
I came to the wrong place.

1441
01:45:34,091 --> 01:45:37,980
May God keep you happy
and a brother.

1442
01:45:50,477 --> 01:45:51,746
Come on, we're leaving.

1443
01:46:19,255 --> 01:46:20,237
Roop.

1444
01:46:21,255 --> 01:46:25,537
Pooja was yours is yours
and will continue to be yours.

1445
01:46:25,944 --> 01:46:27,555
How good you came.

1446
01:46:28,565 --> 01:46:30,900
Otherwise, Pooja
would become my wife.

1447
01:46:31,652 --> 01:46:33,167
But it would not have been mine.

1448
01:46:34,178 --> 01:46:36,935
Ven. She's waiting for you.

1449
01:46:37,845 --> 01:46:40,000
- I'm going, sir.
- Come on, brother.

1450
01:46:40,333 --> 01:46:41,140
Come, come.

1451
01:46:44,264 --> 01:46:45,194
Come, Roop, come.

1452
01:46:46,864 --> 01:46:47,694
Pooja.

1453
01:47:04,535 --> 01:47:06,137
What are you doing?

1454
01:47:20,735 --> 01:47:21,837
Roop!

1455
01:47:22,435 --> 01:47:23,837
Roop!

1456
01:47:26,893 --> 01:47:28,015
What happened?

1457
01:47:31,434 --> 01:47:34,196
Tell me, what happened?

1458
01:47:34,829 --> 01:47:35,626
Narang.

1459
01:47:36,829 --> 01:47:41,726
Narang is calling you.
He is waiting for you.

1460
01:47:43,742 --> 01:47:45,289
Come with me, come on.

1461
01:47:46,393 --> 01:47:47,740
Why should I go?

1462
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:49,207
Why should I go?

1463
01:47:49,859 --> 01:47:52,344
I paid all my debts to Narang!

1464
01:47:53,355 --> 01:47:55,209
With great difficulty I freed myself!

1465
01:47:55,814 --> 01:47:58,261
- I will not go anywhere!
- Are you crazy!

1466
01:47:58,965 --> 01:48:02,232
Why do not you understand? Explain it!

1467
01:48:03,441 --> 01:48:05,458
- Let's go see it!
- I will not go.

1468
01:48:06,497 --> 01:48:08,382
Nobody ever get rid of it!

1469
01:48:09,196 --> 01:48:12,000
- For the love of God, come!
- I will not go with you.

1470
01:48:12,284 --> 01:48:13,700
- I beg you, come with me!
- I will not go!

1471
01:48:13,977 --> 01:48:15,000
Narang men are waiting
.

1472
01:48:15,277 --> 01:48:16,800
Let them wait, let them wait.

1473
01:48:17,310 --> 01:48:20,030
I will not run away! I'm not going to run away!

1474
01:48:21,340 --> 01:48:23,800
Narang is a very dangerous man.
Do not mess with him.

1475
01:48:24,060 --> 01:48:26,300
- I will not go.
- Brother Roop, he's right.

1476
01:48:26,721 --> 01:48:28,300
Narang is very dangerous.
Take Pooja and go ..

1477
01:48:28,603 --> 01:48:30,500
..for The back door.
We take care of everything.

1478
01:48:30,851 --> 01:48:33,100
Roop not have time to think.
Huye with Pooja.

1479
01:48:33,441 --> 01:48:36,600
How long?
For how long I'll keep running away?

1480
01:48:37,181 --> 01:48:39,727
I was in the wrong way
enough time!

1481
01:48:40,030 --> 01:48:43,333
I can not continue the rest of my life
well, not anymore! Do not! Do not!

1482
01:48:44,842 --> 01:48:46,358
Now I will not flee.

1483
01:48:47,768 --> 01:48:53,352
I'll take the same path that brought me here
.

1484
01:48:55,047 --> 01:48:56,727
I'm willing to face up to
death!

1485
01:48:57,853 --> 01:49:00,709
Now I have my life with me.

1486
01:49:01,816 --> 01:49:04,375
Come on, Pooja. We will not flee.

1487
01:49:04,705 --> 01:49:06,400
Roop! Roop! He will kill you.

1488
01:49:06,692 --> 01:49:09,390
Enough! He does not scare me anymore!

1489
01:49:21,421 --> 01:49:25,316
Do not touch me! Do not touch me!
I have nothing to do with you!

1490
01:49:25,781 --> 01:49:27,865
I'm going here with my life.

1491
01:49:28,278 --> 01:49:31,230
Come on, Pooja. Come on.

1492
01:49:32,639 --> 01:49:33,577
No, Roop!

1493
01:49:34,280 --> 01:49:34,700
Roop!

1494
01:49:34,994 --> 01:49:36,100
Did not you hear what I said?

1495
01:49:36,377 --> 01:49:38,300
Did not you hear I said no
molestaras me for nothing?

1496
01:49:38,734 --> 01:49:41,000
Are you deaf? Come here! Come here!

1497
01:49:41,343 --> 01:49:43,441
Stop bothering !

1498
01:49:44,747 --> 01:49:46,200
- Stop!
- No, Roop!

1499
01:49:47,519 --> 01:49:49,600
You want to hit me? Hit me!

1500
01:49:49,877 --> 01:49:52,009
Hit me, damn you!

1501
01:50:01,886 --> 01:50:02,844
Damn!

1502
01:50:17,855 --> 01:50:18,900
Bastard!

1503
01:50:19,155 --> 01:50:23,300
Where did he go? Seek it!

1504
01:50:24,231 --> 01:50:27,347
What will I tell my sister?
Seek it!

1505
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:52,700
Reshma, what happened to you?

1506
01:50:53,051 --> 01:50:55,167
I used to think you were God.

1507
01:50:55,488 --> 01:50:58,000
You could get what I wanted
.

1508
01:50:58,288 --> 01:50:59,195
Reshma ..

1509
01:51:03,700 --> 01:51:05,045
But you lost.

1510
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:08,000
My God lost.

1511
01:51:08,300 --> 01:51:11,157
No, Reshma. No, Reshma. I did not lose.

1512
01:51:13,060 --> 01:51:16,545
Reshma, Roop back to you, I give you my word
.

How are you going to hit me, Dad?
Your hands are tied.

1685
02:07:45,287 --> 02:07:47,368
Whether my hands are tied
or not ..

1686
02:07:48,170 --> 02:07:52,931
..if Anything happens to my daughter, you'll hit a lot
.

02:07:53,833 --> 02:07:56,687
How are you going to hit me?
Your hands are tied, right?

1688
02:07:56,977 --> 02:08:00,070
- Want to see how you hit?
- Yes, let's see.

1689
02:08:01,072 --> 02:08:02,310
Do not complain later, son.

1690
02:08:02,581 --> 02:08:05,100
Hit me as much as you, I
never hurt me.

1691

1704
02:09:44,629 --> 02:09:45,466
With permission.

1705
02:09:49,953 --> 02:09:52,100
Where is Reshma?
Why you are upstairs?

1706
02:09:52,421 --> 02:09:53,500
- It is being prepared.

Yes, sir.

1708
02:10:08,479 --> 02:10:10,625
I like flowers.

1709
02:10:12,234 --> 02:10:14,271
I like music.

1710
02:10:15,978 --> 02:10:18,961
I love beautiful things.

1711
02:10:20,265 --> 02:10:25,296
But you're forcing tú..me
do this.

1712
02:10:26,401 --> 02:10:32,800
Look, look at this. Look at my hand.
He's hurt!

1713
02:10:33,338 --> 02:10:35,217
Why do not you talk to me?

1714
02:10:36,823 --> 02:10:40,878
Why do not you tell me what you have
I do not have?

1715
02:10:41,382 --> 02:10:44,695
Look! Look at my hair.

1716
02:10:45,499 --> 02:10:49,185
Look at my eyes, look at my lips, my body
.

1717
02:10:49,515 --> 02:10:55,148
I am more beautiful than you!
So why did he leave me?

1718
02:10:56,153 --> 02:10:59,800
Speak! Why did you leave me? Speaks!

1719
02:11:00,107 --> 02:11:01,584
It's very painful, right, Reshma?

1720
02:11:02,086 --> 02:11:04,696
But your pain does not decrease
causing me harm.

1721
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:08,100
You do not hate me, you'll hate yourself
.

1722
02:11:08,400 --> 02:11:11,869
You rage yourself.
I have hurt you.

1723
02:11:14,068 --> 02:11:16,407
How you dare feel sorry
me?

1724
02:11:16,807 --> 02:11:18,136
You snatched me Roop!

1725
02:11:19,636 --> 02:11:21,275
And now you feel sorry for me!

1726
02:11:25,873 --> 02:11:30,081
You can kill me, but you can never take away
to Roop.

1727
02:11:31,081 --> 02:11:32,850
Because love can never be taken away
!

1728
02:11:33,650 --> 02:11:35,149
Can not be bought!

1729
02:11:36,149 --> 02:11:38,818
And nobody knows that better than you
, Reshma.

1730
02:11:40,218 --> 02:11:43,400
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you, bitch!

1731
02:11:43,700 --> 02:11:44,900
- Lady.
- What?

1732
02:11:45,200 --> 02:11:46,699
The Lord is calling.

1733
02:14:09,637 --> 02:14:12,906
I can not believe that there is a
lover like you.

1734
02:14:13,905 --> 02:14:15,906
Ama while dead.

1735
02:14:17,223 --> 02:14:21,431
It is very painful, look at the state
where you are.

1736
02:14:22,340 --> 02:14:24,989
And where's your dad?
Do not you brought with you?

1737
02:14:39,783 --> 02:14:44,181
Friends, he will entertain us in our party
today, again.

1738
02:14:46,780 --> 02:14:50,989
But entertainment today,
it will be different.

1739
02:14:53,887 --> 02:14:57,156
Today, I shall touch the instrument ..

1740
02:14:59,355 --> 02:15:02,194
..and He will sound.

1741
02:15:32,210 --> 02:15:36,408
Narang  Hey! Only that?

02:18:17,297 --> 02:18:22,475
I do not hurt me! I do not hurt me!
I do not hurt me! I do not hurt me!

1757
02:18:27,573 --> 02:18:29,003
Did you hurt, Narang?

1758
02:18:30,302 --> 02:18:31,442
It hurts, right?

1759
02:18:32,741 --> 02:18:33,781

I do not hurt me.

1761
02:18:40,808 --> 02:18:42,227
Did you hurt, Narang?

1762
02:18:53,823 --> 02:18:55,932
Look, Narang! I do not hurt me!

1763

That hurts, right Narang?
I do not hurt me! I do not hurt me!

1764
02:19:16,434 --> 02:19:18,333
Clap! Come on!

1765
02:19:20,432 --> 02:19:22,441
Get up! Arise, Narang!

1766
02:19:23,032 --> 02:19:24,441
Get up!

02:19:25,340 --> 02:19:27,380
Clap! Clap! Come on!

1768
02:19:27,669 --> 02:19:29,968
Arise, Narang! Get up!

1769
02:19:54,457 --> 02:19:56,356
Tired?

1770
02:20:48,486 --> 02:20:51,895
Look! I do not hurt me!

1771
02:20:57,493 --> 02:21:01,500
Tell me, where is my Pooja?
Tell me or I'll cut your throat!

1772
02:21:02,101 --> 02:21:04,000
Roop, stop!

1773
02:21:04,400 --> 02:21:06,599
Or the courage !

1774
02:21:08,300 --> 02:21:10,152
Roop  No, do not worry about me.

1775
02:21:10,755 --> 02:21:14,046
Do not save the man who killed our father
!

1776
02:21:14,449 --> 02:21:16,461
Kill him! Kill him!

1777
02:21:18,373 --> 02:21:22,530
Throw me! I'm ready to die!
Come on!

1778
02:21:22,872 --> 02:21:23,948
Why are you waiting?

1779
02:21:24,753 --> 02:21:26,858
Throw me! Throw me!

1780
02:21:27,538 --> 02:21:30,027
- Did you see?
- Throw me!

1781
02:21:30,731 --> 02:21:32,210
Did you see that?

1782
02:21:34,927 --> 02:21:38,258
You asked me, "What is the difference between your Pooja
and I?"

1783
02:21:39,063 --> 02:21:40,281
This is the difference!

1784
02:21:40,889 --> 02:21:41,996
This is the difference!

1785
02:21:48,130 --> 02:21:50,717
She is ready to give his life for me
.

1786
02:21:52,629 --> 02:21:54,744
She can die for me!

1787
02:21:56,654 --> 02:21:58,506
This is the difference.

1788
02:22:00,217 --> 02:22:02,602
She can give his life for me.

1789
02:22:03,708 --> 02:22:04,785
That's the difference!

1790
02:22:05,693 --> 02:22:10,187
That's the difference, that's the difference between you and
my Pooja.

1791
02:22:11,296 --> 02:22:13,276
You say you love me?

1792
02:22:14,488 --> 02:22:17,737
- Can you do anything for me?
- Safely!

1793
02:22:18,240 --> 02:22:21,138
- Come with me, we will die together!
- Do not!

1794
02:22:21,943 --> 02:22:23,382
- Come on!
- Do not! Brother!

1795
02:22:24,188 --> 02:22:26,402
- Come on!
- Do not!

1796
02:23:09,874 --> 02:23:11,867
Perdimos..hermano.

1797
02:23:12,978 --> 02:23:17,202
Love ellos..ganó.

1798
02:24:25,674 --> 02:24:27,724
It hurts, right, Narang?

1799
02:24:29,739 --> 02:24:32,826
It really hurts when your loved one dies
, right?

1800
02:24:36,854 --> 02:24:40,213
I felt that same pain when you killed my father
.

1801
02:24:44,821 --> 02:24:49,887
I would download every bullet
of this weapon in your head.

1802
02:24:50,897 --> 02:24:52,588
But my father always said ..

1803
02:24:53,297 --> 02:24:54,488
.. "Roop ..

1804
02:24:55,605 --> 02:24:58,321
..nunca kill a man who already
is dead."
