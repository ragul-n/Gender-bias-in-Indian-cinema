1
00:00:06,625 --> 00:00:10,827
Excuse me sir..
we are about to land in Hyderabad

2
00:00:24,803 --> 00:00:31,568
Sir, the Metro Pillars Moulding is leaving to
Bangalore from the Moulding unit

3
00:00:31,768 --> 00:00:33,343
Let's go

4
00:00:48,195 --> 00:00:51,607
Sir, admin staff have come
to talk to you for a minute

5
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:52,749
Morning Sir

6
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:53,375
What?

7
00:00:53,574 --> 00:01:00,505
Tomorrow is the last day of
Sri Ram Navami celebrations in our colony

8
00:01:00,704 --> 00:01:05,258
We all will be happy if you grace
the occasion with your family

9
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:09,094
Sorry Prasad, there's a family party
tomorrow evening.  You go ahead.. Okay

10
00:01:09,295 --> 00:01:11,513
We have pinned our hopes on you sir

11
00:01:11,712 --> 00:01:13,288
But I can't come

12
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,103
The handsome prince
of Surya Vamsi dynasty,

13
00:01:33,103 --> 00:01:36,764
The man whose beauty
resembles a full-moon day.

14
00:01:38,857 --> 00:01:45,354
The king who lived like a commoner,

15
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:54,167
unblemished and forever fighting
for public and Dharma,

16
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:02,783
The incarnation of the greatest,
none other than Sri Rama!

17
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:15,684
Here comes Rama who lifts
the bow of Shiva effortlessly

18
00:02:15,884 --> 00:02:23,731
arching the bow and aiming at the sky,

19
00:02:23,932 --> 00:02:26,317
When the stretched bow broke
with a thundering sound,

20
00:02:26,516 --> 00:02:28,944
it appears the sky came crashing down
and the eight directions exploded,

21
00:02:29,143 --> 00:02:33,656
With the breaking of the bow, he
became the son-in-law of King Janaka,

22
00:02:33,857 --> 00:02:38,859
O Rama Rama Rama Rama
Rama Rama Rama Rama

23
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:43,979
Like the Rama’s army,
let us all be one and united!

24
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,033
O Rama Rama Rama Rama
Rama Rama Rama Rama

25
00:02:49,033 --> 00:02:54,029
Like the Rama’s army,
let us all be one and united!

26
00:03:11,842 --> 00:03:19,731
Hail, he cared a hoot for the kingdom
and left for the forest,

27
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:27,486
He was as delicate as a flower,
even then threw away all comforts.

28
00:03:27,686 --> 00:03:30,688
What a man Rama was!
To leave all the life’s comforts

29
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:34,241
to walk a path full of turns.
He walked into thorns

30
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,410
and gave us a tale of moral-beads!

31
00:03:38,611 --> 00:03:42,613
O Rama Rama Rama Rama
Rama Rama Rama Rama

32
00:03:42,614 --> 00:03:47,901
Like the Rama’s army,
let us all be one and united!

33
00:03:49,076 --> 00:03:53,079
O Rama Rama Rama Rama
Rama Rama Rama Rama

34
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:58,326
Like the Rama’s army,
let us all be one and united!

35
00:04:09,884 --> 00:04:11,885
Hey, Rama is the most
beautiful one, the one

36
00:04:11,886 --> 00:04:15,730
so delicate that a mere stare by
other woman swells him,

37
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,932
He is so beautiful that
even the sky loses

38
00:04:18,933 --> 00:04:21,968
its blue lustre  when Rama
walks the ground tall.

39
00:04:31,567 --> 00:04:39,372
Born like a human
but grew like a God,

40
00:04:39,573 --> 00:04:44,575
Walked on plain sands,
but became worthy of

41
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:47,503
adulation with flowers and worship.

42
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:53,707
Built a bridge to cross the ocean
and killed the man

43
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:58,636
with ten heads and his wickedness
presenting goodness.

44
00:04:58,837 --> 00:05:02,838
O Rama Rama Rama Rama
Rama Rama Rama Rama

45
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:08,083
Like the Rama’s army,
let us all be one and united!

46
00:05:09,177 --> 00:05:13,179
O Rama Rama Rama Rama
Rama Rama Rama Rama

47
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:18,426
Like the Rama's army,
let us all be one and united!

48
00:05:34,946 --> 00:05:36,564
You haven't slept?

49
00:05:37,155 --> 00:05:38,081
Where are you coming from?

50
00:05:38,281 --> 00:05:39,416
I had a small work to attend to

51
00:05:39,616 --> 00:05:40,750
Is it something that
you can't talk about?

52
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:43,951
It's worth talking.
Our staff organised Sri Rama Navami

53
00:05:43,952 --> 00:05:46,862
celebrations in the colony,
I have been there.

54
00:05:48,998 --> 00:05:53,910
Is it? They should have called me and
would have come. What did you do there?

55
00:05:54,293 --> 00:05:58,496
There was a ritual offering and
we sang in the praise of God.

56
00:05:59,838 --> 00:06:04,516
You knew uncle was throwing a party
and we all would be present.

57
00:06:04,717 --> 00:06:06,935
You know I can't handle these parties.

58
00:06:07,136 --> 00:06:10,922
Harsha, you are missing every party
and all the fun

59
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:11,939
Yeah, I know

60
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:17,110
All big wigs were present, my brother
felt awkward not having you there.

61
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,279
But we are in a better place to face
our staff because I went there

62
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:22,055
Enough Harsha!

63
00:06:24,231 --> 00:06:25,725
What's wrong with you?

64
00:06:27,943 --> 00:06:30,270
That is what I wanted to ask you.

65
00:06:30,736 --> 00:06:33,737
Our staff invited us and
you organised a party without

66
00:06:33,738 --> 00:06:36,691
a purpose and saw to it that
these people didn't go.

67
00:06:37,491 --> 00:06:41,402
They were happy to see me there.

68
00:06:42,329 --> 00:06:43,947
I want to talk to you,

69
00:06:44,414 --> 00:06:45,923
can you give me some time

70
00:06:46,122 --> 00:06:51,077
It's very late, will talk in the morning.
Good night mom

71
00:06:59,257 --> 00:07:03,168
Just yesterday got black soil
Unloaded and saplings planted.

72
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:11,216
Can we talk now?

73
00:07:13,935 --> 00:07:16,220
I've been observing,
trying to understand you,

74
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:19,014
our thoughts aren't matching

75
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,725
Being my son!
I am trying to understand you

76
00:07:22,983 --> 00:07:24,476
What a pity!

77
00:07:25,151 --> 00:07:26,994
I thought you opted for a hostel
instead of a school,

78
00:07:27,195 --> 00:07:28,954
because you liked being with friends.

79
00:07:29,153 --> 00:07:31,455
Wanted a best college and
you went somewhere else.

80
00:07:31,655 --> 00:07:35,167
You wanted to go abroad and I
thought was to explore the world.

81
00:07:35,367 --> 00:07:37,794
Then you said no to business
and took up a job

82
00:07:37,994 --> 00:07:39,879
thought you wanted to learn work.

83
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:41,213
Finally you came home

84
00:07:41,412 --> 00:07:47,868
I expected you to take up our business,
it is not happening.

85
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:53,847
At home, you are aloof. Just not me,
none in the house can understand you.

86
00:07:54,047 --> 00:07:55,373
Why?

87
00:07:55,673 --> 00:07:59,292
Every man has an element that is
beyond comprehension.  In you too.

88
00:08:01,261 --> 00:08:07,966
I have never seen you speak
affectionately to anyone. Why?

89
00:08:09,141 --> 00:08:14,930
I am not here for arguments,
when are you taking over the business?

90
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,557
I have no inclination

91
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:19,949
What?

92
00:08:20,149 --> 00:08:22,601
I am not inclined to
look after your business

93
00:08:24,068 --> 00:08:27,897
You are the sole inheritor
of thousands of crores.

94
00:08:28,615 --> 00:08:31,066
Sounds silly

95
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:35,318
I thought you are something different,
but you are mad...

96
00:08:36,536 --> 00:08:38,505
What do I do with all this?

97
00:08:38,704 --> 00:08:40,406
How can I answer that?

98
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,092
What did your father do?

99
00:08:44,292 --> 00:08:44,967
Farming

100
00:08:45,168 --> 00:08:47,328
Then after him, why didn't
you continue farming?

101
00:08:48,754 --> 00:08:52,665
You went against him, worked hard and
reached this position. I respect you for that.

102
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:57,919
Let me do what I want and
earn some respect

103
00:08:59,387 --> 00:09:00,646
What do you intend to do?

104
00:09:00,845 --> 00:09:03,923
I haven't thought of anything yet..
Let's see

105
00:09:06,767 --> 00:09:09,759
Veeraiah.. Ask for another half load
of red soil.	- Okay Sir!

106
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:28,357
Ravi...what's wrong?
Not a perfect shot since morning.

107
00:09:28,699 --> 00:09:29,584
My son

108
00:09:29,784 --> 00:09:33,377
What's wrong with him..
He’s smart, you got the best

109
00:09:33,578 --> 00:09:37,579
That is what I thought and
was hoping he would take over

110
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:41,383
my business someday.
Finally he said no.

111
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:42,659
What?

112
00:09:44,294 --> 00:09:49,163
He doesn't want wealth,
he wants to do what he feels like

113
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:57,678
They are fickle minded at this age,
we should divert him.

114
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:59,713
Why don't you get him married?

115
00:10:04,225 --> 00:10:09,429
We as a family don't understand him,
how can the girl...? Tea!	   - Thank You

116
00:10:14,441 --> 00:10:18,443
Do you know the beauty of this life?
It’s beautiful..

117
00:10:18,444 --> 00:10:21,412
Do you know how to live
this beautiful life?

118
00:10:21,612 --> 00:10:22,938
How?

119
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,484
In a beautiful way

120
00:10:30,034 --> 00:10:34,547
Harsha, there is a collaboration meeting
in office tomorrow about a new project.

121
00:10:34,747 --> 00:10:38,749
You are one of the board of directors.
If you come once in a while,

122
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,243
people will find it nice

123
00:10:41,543 --> 00:10:44,054
Can you come?
Do you have other work?

124
00:10:44,254 --> 00:10:50,125
Why will he not come if it is
an important meeting?

125
00:10:51,468 --> 00:10:55,254
He will be the first to arrive

126
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:14,393
Hello sir, Welcome!

127
00:11:58,473 --> 00:12:02,110
It is a good alliance Madhav Rao,
the boy is well educated. Good family.

128
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:05,311
Not talking of dowry per se,
but if we handle the expenses  of

129
00:12:05,312 --> 00:12:07,181
his higher studies, it will suffice.

130
00:12:12,814 --> 00:12:16,909
It is a good match Sudhakar,
but we need to assess our capacity.

131
00:12:17,108 --> 00:12:21,453
All these years I have planned equally for
son's studies and daughter's wedding.

132
00:12:21,655 --> 00:12:25,022
If I give everything to her,
what will happen to his future?

133
00:12:25,532 --> 00:12:27,442
Think once again,

134
00:12:27,825 --> 00:12:30,694
they are coming to see her this evening

135
00:12:31,494 --> 00:12:36,280
I will talk openly about my capacity,
rest it is in her destiny.

136
00:12:38,292 --> 00:12:42,578
Sir, meeting has begun,
everyone are waiting for you

137
00:12:44,336 --> 00:12:48,338
Very warm welcome to all. Before we
get into technicalities of this project,

138
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:49,765
I would like to mention a few things.

139
00:12:49,965 --> 00:12:55,103
As most of you know, we at RK Engineering
never involved in collaborations before this.

140
00:12:55,303 --> 00:12:59,060
But that is all a thing of the past.
From today we are with you and

141
00:12:59,281 --> 00:13:02,316
take immense pleasure in collaborating
with you on this project.

142
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:06,594
So the market, ladies and gentlemen,
is watching us very keenly.

143
00:13:07,312 --> 00:13:11,723
It is going to be the most prestigious
Project till date. Shall we?

144
00:13:13,191 --> 00:13:16,768
Harsha....Are you bored?

145
00:13:18,194 --> 00:13:19,604
I am fine

146
00:13:22,738 --> 00:13:23,664
Meghana!
Uncle.

147
00:13:23,864 --> 00:13:28,526
You also seem bored, why don't both
of you go down and have a cup of coffee

148
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,819
Okay... sure!

149
00:13:36,957 --> 00:13:38,366
Harsha..

150
00:13:54,259 --> 00:13:58,588
Do you know why they are calling
us both for the business meeting?

151
00:13:59,054 --> 00:14:02,132
To meet like this and talk personally

152
00:14:03,516 --> 00:14:08,519
Ours are big business families,
both of us are the only heads

153
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,946
of the families and highly educated

154
00:14:10,146 --> 00:14:16,149
and we know each other very well,
and they felt we are made for each other

155
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,560
and of course we too.

156
00:14:19,695 --> 00:14:23,773
Maybe I look that way,
but I am not perfect for you.

157
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:29,444
I live in my own world,
I will bore you.

158
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,486
You are too modest.
I like you even more now.

159
00:14:34,663 --> 00:14:36,574
Do you want me to be more honest!

160
00:14:36,874 --> 00:14:38,826
Even you aren't correct for me.

161
00:14:39,501 --> 00:14:41,868
You will appear too boring in my world.

162
00:14:44,087 --> 00:14:47,497
I'm done with the coffee, I will leave.

163
00:14:53,609 --> 00:14:56,794
Salutations

164
00:14:58,846 --> 00:15:01,005
Madhav Rao's son Sudheer

165
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:15,100
We like your girl very much

166
00:15:17,027 --> 00:15:21,028
We heard about your principles,
goodness, and are happy to have

167
00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:22,938
an alliance with your family.

168
00:15:23,739 --> 00:15:27,741
I don't know if my son's future
will cause concern but if he

169
00:15:27,742 --> 00:15:30,252
stabilises in his career,
your daughter will be happy.

170
00:15:30,451 --> 00:15:35,365
We wanted to broach the topic,
there is nothing wrong in you asking

171
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:41,219
Babu Harsha!
You...to our house

172
00:15:41,419 --> 00:15:43,911
Heard the boy is coming to see
Rajani and so I came

173
00:15:48,256 --> 00:15:50,516
Our Chairman Ravikant's son

174
00:15:50,715 --> 00:15:52,100
Namaste Sir!
Please sit sir

175
00:15:52,301 --> 00:15:53,959
come sir
Please sit

176
00:15:55,636 --> 00:15:57,588
Hi sir,
Hi!

177
00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:03,984
Whenever I see your dad I get inspired
to work hard and become successful.

178
00:16:04,185 --> 00:16:05,593
All the best!

179
00:16:07,677 --> 00:16:11,797
Madhav Rao is a long standing employee
and he is family to us.

180
00:16:12,473 --> 00:16:14,675
A wedding in his family
is like a wedding in ours.

181
00:16:17,684 --> 00:16:20,346
I heard your son needs
money for studies.

182
00:16:20,561 --> 00:16:24,563
We have allotted shares in company
for his service, No problem in giving it.

183
00:16:24,564 --> 00:16:27,308
Look out for an auspicious date,

184
00:16:30,278 --> 00:16:33,395
she is our girl....look after her well.

185
00:16:35,282 --> 00:16:37,440
Will take leave sir

186
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:46,003
I will send a cheque of Rs 20 lakh
tomorrow from office

187
00:16:46,203 --> 00:16:48,047
what kind of help is this?

188
00:16:48,248 --> 00:16:53,250
It is not help, it is support.
All these years you have supported us,

189
00:16:53,251 --> 00:16:54,494
now we will stand by you.

190
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,554
Sudheer, are you studying well?
Yes

191
00:16:57,754 --> 00:17:00,999
father has lot of belief in you,
wish you make him proud.

192
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:04,877
Take him inside everyone
is waiting, go sir

193
00:17:11,181 --> 00:17:12,797
Harsha..

194
00:17:13,308 --> 00:17:16,510
Harsha...You left the meeting abruptly,
never returned.. Where did you go?

195
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:18,594
Which meeting?

196
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,771
To see a girl, you could have said
that directly.

197
00:17:22,272 --> 00:17:25,032
Why talk about board meetings,
and offices like a child.

198
00:17:25,231 --> 00:17:27,725
It is embarrassing for me,
later it will be for you too.

199
00:17:30,777 --> 00:17:39,876
He went to Madhav Rao's house
and donated 20 lakhs for her wedding.

200
00:17:40,076 --> 00:17:44,694
He also instructed the money to be
delivered first thing in the morning.

201
00:17:47,997 --> 00:17:51,383
What is this Harsha? 20 lakhs!
What are you trying to do?

202
00:17:51,584 --> 00:17:53,326
Trying to be human.

203
00:17:54,336 --> 00:17:57,163
He is been working with us
for many years.

204
00:17:57,922 --> 00:18:02,600
We have been growing but he's now
struggling to get his daughter married

205
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,934
Shame on us Karthik!

206
00:18:05,133 --> 00:18:08,604
Do we keep donating each
just as he is in a problem.

207
00:18:08,804 --> 00:18:10,172
They are family.

208
00:18:12,307 --> 00:18:16,777
He doesn't know about this,
else he would have given more.

209
00:18:16,977 --> 00:18:19,554
Karthik send the money
in the first hour

210
00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:30,312
This is 20 Lakh, how much more
will he keep giving like this?

211
00:18:31,946 --> 00:18:40,152
You are still thinking about 20 lakhs,
I am worried about his thoughts.

212
00:18:48,623 --> 00:18:53,301
I didn't know they called you to office
to arrange a meeting with her.

213
00:18:53,502 --> 00:18:54,785
It is okay mother

214
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:59,581
Is there someone in your mind?
Harsha

215
00:19:00,257 --> 00:19:02,624
If there is something like that,
I will tell you first

216
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:10,296
Okay.. sleep early, we are going to temple
at 5 am for abhishekam on your name

217
00:19:19,516 --> 00:19:23,416
Sister in law, we said Sandhya yesterday
that we got to go today to the temple

218
00:19:23,616 --> 00:19:27,784
You always keep supporting her.
She comes late going to parties.

219
00:20:14,516 --> 00:20:15,275
How much time.. Sister-in-law

220
00:20:15,474 --> 00:20:18,110
What is it Harsha, you are taking us
around this place so many times

221
00:20:18,311 --> 00:20:20,970
I missed the way as it is dark

222
00:20:22,147 --> 00:20:25,806
DEVARAKOTA
Some Village in northern part of Andhra

223
00:20:43,537 --> 00:20:45,696
Quick.. Quick..

224
00:20:46,915 --> 00:20:52,536
Nothing to worry.. Take them fast..
Anyone else there?

225
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:56,221
Ramudu.. See if there is anyone on
that side of the room	- Okay!

226
00:20:56,421 --> 00:21:01,417
Careful....hold properly
Give here

227
00:21:03,093 --> 00:21:06,711
Careful....

228
00:21:09,263 --> 00:21:12,440
Hey.. Give here..
Move, move

229
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:21,557
He was smiling this morning when he went
to school.. By noon he left permanently

230
00:21:37,868 --> 00:21:39,485
Doctor..
Sir!

231
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,086
What is the situation?

232
00:21:41,286 --> 00:21:42,587
four kids died...sir

233
00:21:42,787 --> 00:21:45,449
Two were critical so
we sent them to the town

234
00:21:50,428 --> 00:21:52,586
Whose children died?

235
00:21:52,929 --> 00:21:54,588
It is over.

236
00:21:55,556 --> 00:21:59,558
Ten thousand to those who died
and five thousand to those

237
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:01,551
who were injured.
Will talk to the government

238
00:22:04,896 --> 00:22:08,199
Since 2 years Narayana Rao garu has been
warning that school may collapse anytime

239
00:22:08,399 --> 00:22:12,034
Four kids have died because
none of them bothered

240
00:22:12,233 --> 00:22:14,810
Is he telling that..
I have killed?

241
00:22:15,321 --> 00:22:19,081
They are youngsters,
they do not know how to talk.

242
00:22:19,282 --> 00:22:22,126
Like you said it is over.

243
00:22:22,326 --> 00:22:26,794
In the neighbouring villages too, there are
around 15 schools in the same condition

244
00:22:26,994 --> 00:22:30,089
Anything might happen any moment..
we are scared. You must do something.

245
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:31,924
That is what I am saying

246
00:22:32,123 --> 00:22:40,128
Instead of studying in such old schools,
go around the district  and

247
00:22:40,129 --> 00:22:41,514
tell them all to join my convent.

248
00:22:41,715 --> 00:22:43,715
In order to see your schools,
business to flourish...

249
00:22:43,716 --> 00:22:45,750
you want to play with
the lives of children?

250
00:22:46,927 --> 00:22:49,378
I will speak, you go.

251
00:22:52,848 --> 00:22:53,857
you gone mad?

252
00:22:54,057 --> 00:22:59,059
They are looting everything..
Even the food we eat.

253
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:03,113
We are staying silent,
now people are dying

254
00:23:03,313 --> 00:23:06,491
So you want to pick up a fight with him?
You will die

255
00:23:06,691 --> 00:23:08,059
Uncle!

256
00:23:13,542 --> 00:23:14,462
Brother!

257
00:23:14,662 --> 00:23:18,094
We got these reporters in the bus
at Veerlapadu junction

258
00:23:35,851 --> 00:23:38,354
One guy died falling from the bullock cart

259
00:23:39,575 --> 00:23:41,797
One died with snake bite in the fields

260
00:23:42,617 --> 00:23:44,407
One died due to Sun stroke

261
00:23:45,692 --> 00:23:48,298
A lady died by slipping her leg in the well

262
00:23:49,813 --> 00:23:52,028
How great are such to write, bloody?

263
00:23:53,537 --> 00:23:56,155
Did you feel to grow writing
about me instead of these?

264
00:23:56,355 --> 00:24:03,524
What idiots, why do you not tell him that
we die but not grow messing with Sasi?

265
00:24:04,314 --> 00:24:06,162
Do you still feel that I would fear for you?

266
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:09,798
Nobody is able to live in peace
here because of you

267
00:24:09,998 --> 00:24:12,003
It is better I die instead of that.

268
00:24:14,793 --> 00:24:15,893
Yes!

269
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,599
Hey, take these two onto the highway
and dash them with Lorry.

270
00:24:38,891 --> 00:24:41,593
They have killed my brother..

271
00:24:42,144 --> 00:24:47,389
They were scared he would go against..
so they killed him in the orchard

272
00:24:56,362 --> 00:25:00,248
Where are you going..  Nagulu?
Leaving to the city,

273
00:25:00,448 --> 00:25:03,375
planning to take up some job
and educate him

274
00:25:03,575 --> 00:25:07,003
For that do you need to leave the village?
Isn't he studying well here too?

275
00:25:07,203 --> 00:25:10,781
If he stays here,
he will die like his brother

276
00:25:12,206 --> 00:25:15,116
Allow us to leave and live in peace

277
00:25:17,794 --> 00:25:23,798
What will you do in the city?
Think about our village,

278
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:28,502
why don't you tell him to stay back.
Listen to me.. Nagulu

279
00:25:33,722 --> 00:25:37,007
521

280
00:25:43,021 --> 00:25:45,488
521

281
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:47,158
What 521?

282
00:25:47,357 --> 00:25:52,687
After all the people left to the city,
remaining number is 521 families.

283
00:25:55,822 --> 00:25:57,873
Okay go..
Cake will come in half-hour okay.

284
00:25:58,074 --> 00:26:00,292
Harsha,
Happy Birthday to me

285
00:26:00,491 --> 00:26:02,235
Mom, Harsha has come.

286
00:26:02,535 --> 00:26:03,460
How are you?
I am fine.

287
00:26:03,661 --> 00:26:05,337
How are your parents?
They are fine

288
00:26:05,537 --> 00:26:10,256
He got a job in your company by your help,
else he would never get married in this life.

289
00:26:10,458 --> 00:26:12,801
Why speak of marriage on a birthday?
Looks like you are a hindrance for that.

290
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,496
Let's go upstairs Harsha. I ordered
a fresh strawberry cake

291
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:26,936
Hey, your Appi has done superb
illumination.. He even put up a flexi....

292
00:26:27,136 --> 00:26:28,754
Excuse me Mam...

293
00:26:31,013 --> 00:26:32,023
Birthday cake ma'am

294
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:33,716
Thank you

295
00:26:36,893 --> 00:26:38,027
Cake is good

296
00:26:38,228 --> 00:26:39,554
Appu

297
00:26:40,354 --> 00:26:42,390
Hey.. What are you doing?

298
00:26:43,898 --> 00:26:46,368
Children...come, come

299
00:26:46,567 --> 00:26:47,242
What is she doing?

300
00:26:47,442 --> 00:26:48,993
Take it and eat it...okay..
Go, go

301
00:26:49,194 --> 00:26:50,936
Than you sister

302
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:56,790
Welcome,
Happy Birthday Appi

303
00:26:56,991 --> 00:26:59,418
Happy Birthday to me...
my friend Harsha

304
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,779
Hi!
Charu.. My cousin

305
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,946
One minute

306
00:27:04,955 --> 00:27:09,925
Hello...you sent the cake?
Whom did you give it to? I didn’t get it,

307
00:27:10,126 --> 00:27:11,386
how is it possible?

308
00:27:11,585 --> 00:27:15,704
I will get it. Sorry..
whom did you give it to?

309
00:27:16,005 --> 00:27:17,005
If the cake would have come in,
we would have finished it by now

310
00:27:17,006 --> 00:27:18,749
and would have gone home.

311
00:27:20,174 --> 00:27:24,102
Don't tell him I did it, he will cry and die.

312
00:27:24,302 --> 00:27:30,857
Is it necessary to cut a cake, blow
candles, sing a song at this age?

313
00:27:31,057 --> 00:27:34,068
Idiot, he is killing everyone

314
00:27:34,268 --> 00:27:35,928
What do you do?

315
00:27:36,436 --> 00:27:39,863
I finished MBA,
doing a rural development course

316
00:27:40,063 --> 00:27:42,158
Rural development course...
What does it mean?

317
00:27:42,357 --> 00:27:48,728
It trains us in developing villages in
modern methods  and empowering them.

318
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:53,565
Interesting! This is the first time
I am seeing someone do this course

319
00:27:54,491 --> 00:27:58,235
I have been studying in the village
since childhood, grew up there.

320
00:27:58,869 --> 00:28:04,872
The village has given me a lot,
I need to give back something

321
00:28:04,873 --> 00:28:06,324
or the other, otherwise I will become fat.

322
00:28:08,001 --> 00:28:11,494
Okay.. Cake has arrived.. Will go.

323
00:28:13,296 --> 00:28:21,002
She is the one who was doing Rangoli
in the morning.  I too saw her, she is nice.

324
00:28:26,222 --> 00:28:30,900
Oh my God.. Charu have you seen a cake
like this? Sparkles, fountain of sparkles.

325
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:34,804
My function is just like Diwali.
Charu look at me no....

326
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,095
Hi!
Hi!

327
00:29:08,294 --> 00:29:11,722
Yesterday.. At the birthday party
How come you are here?

328
00:29:11,922 --> 00:29:14,265
Just got my car serviced and
was going this way, saw you

329
00:29:14,466 --> 00:29:17,477
Where is the service station this side?
Here....you want to see?

330
00:29:17,676 --> 00:29:20,503
No... I casually asked

331
00:29:21,887 --> 00:29:24,047
From the college?
Yes

332
00:29:24,264 --> 00:29:25,483
To the hostel?
Yes

333
00:29:25,682 --> 00:29:26,966
Come.. I will drop you

334
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:31,303
How do you know where my college is?
You know.. Right?

335
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:34,638
Yes
come

336
00:29:41,777 --> 00:29:47,123
Where exactly is the service station?
No... I came for you

337
00:29:47,323 --> 00:29:52,325
Understood. I saw you in the party..
You are pretty.

338
00:29:52,326 --> 00:29:54,878
Felt like seeing you again,
talking again. Isn't it?

339
00:29:55,078 --> 00:29:59,080
Not exactly.
I liked the rural development course..

340
00:29:59,081 --> 00:30:01,133
I want to know more
about the course and college.

341
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:03,217
In fact I too want to join

342
00:30:03,417 --> 00:30:07,287
What work do you have with me?
Take an admission and join

343
00:30:18,137 --> 00:30:21,131
How do you know that
I stay in this hostel?

344
00:30:23,849 --> 00:30:27,851
Last week one morning I saw you
decorating Rangoli.

345
00:30:27,852 --> 00:30:30,679
Not like the service station..
This is true.

346
00:30:32,563 --> 00:30:34,723
Bye..
Bye..

347
00:30:38,818 --> 00:30:40,977
Hey.. See there

348
00:30:43,238 --> 00:30:44,289
Wow!

349
00:30:44,489 --> 00:30:46,023
Charusheela..

350
00:30:47,491 --> 00:30:49,192
You are beautiful..

351
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,111
Inside!

352
00:31:01,418 --> 00:31:03,579
Hey..
Hi..

353
00:31:07,923 --> 00:31:10,975
Isn't he the person who dropped you?
The one we saw in the party last night

354
00:31:11,175 --> 00:31:11,475
Yes

355
00:31:11,676 --> 00:31:15,678
We are unable to forget that face
since we saw him in the party.

356
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:16,729
How did you bump into him?

357
00:31:16,929 --> 00:31:19,065
He was waiting at the college bus stop

358
00:31:19,264 --> 00:31:20,548
Love?

359
00:31:21,015 --> 00:31:25,017
He is not coming out openly...
he is covering it up by saying

360
00:31:25,018 --> 00:31:26,845
he likes the course, the college.

361
00:31:27,353 --> 00:31:31,356
He won't wait for long, tomorrow or
day after he will speak out.

362
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:32,890
Then I will tackle him...

363
00:31:33,274 --> 00:31:38,454
Don't you think you are over doing it?
Do you think he will go behind us?

364
00:31:38,653 --> 00:31:43,833
He has a face and a smile
that will have us drooling over him

365
00:31:44,032 --> 00:31:49,035
Really? All guys are the same.
Wait till tomorrow evening.

366
00:31:49,036 --> 00:31:50,903
Will tell you the latest development.

367
00:32:14,096 --> 00:32:16,632
Hi.. Harsha
Hi.. Subhash

368
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:22,511
Good morning sir..
Good morning.

369
00:33:09,136 --> 00:33:10,854
Hi
Hi...

370
00:33:11,053 --> 00:33:13,963
To the hostel?
Yes.. Hostel only

371
00:33:19,018 --> 00:33:22,362
Can I ask you something?
What?

372
00:33:22,561 --> 00:33:28,684
I joined today, missed the previous classes,
Can you share your notes with me

373
00:33:29,483 --> 00:33:33,828
I didn't take down too many notes.
Check out in the library

374
00:33:34,029 --> 00:33:36,189
Oh that's all?
Yes

375
00:33:53,543 --> 00:33:55,011
What happened?

376
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:56,262
Did he join the class?

377
00:33:56,461 --> 00:33:57,137
Did he come out with his feelings?

378
00:33:57,337 --> 00:34:03,849
Yes he joined, I ignored and
kept him at a distance

379
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:05,060
Really?

380
00:34:05,259 --> 00:34:10,296
Really.. He was staring at me,
not listening to the lecture

381
00:34:12,431 --> 00:34:14,592
Really he was looking at me

382
00:35:03,594 --> 00:35:04,770
You are still here?
It is getting late for the class

383
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:11,973
So what? I'm watching you daily.
You come, leave fast and

384
00:35:11,975 --> 00:35:13,902
write as if you are preparing for EAMCET.

385
00:35:14,102 --> 00:35:21,016
You don't even say hi to me, not even
a smile and it really hurts my feelings.

386
00:35:54,964 --> 00:36:02,728
They have come together, these two
different worlds have come together,

387
00:36:02,928 --> 00:36:09,466
They have come together, when two
different footprints converge in a pair.

388
00:36:11,434 --> 00:36:20,440
The world on one side, these twosome
on the other though they are one and

389
00:36:20,441 --> 00:36:22,368
the same like a replica of each other.

390
00:36:22,567 --> 00:36:27,664
Like a book that nobody has read before,

391
00:36:27,863 --> 00:36:34,026
the twosome are happily reading
each other like never before!

392
00:36:55,591 --> 00:37:01,103
These two souls without a mark on them,
deep within are the same soul.

393
00:37:01,304 --> 00:37:06,608
Two innocent children who know no
bounds and live like in separate hearts,

394
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:10,809
They may not speak to each other often,
but speak  as if they know

395
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:12,154
what’s inside each other’s hearts,

396
00:37:12,353 --> 00:37:17,700
When they face each other,
their minds dance in unison.

397
00:37:17,899 --> 00:37:28,708
Even if they are two different bodies,
the heartbeat is one and the same

398
00:37:28,907 --> 00:37:34,169
Perhaps, Brahma’s mistake of
one should born in two different bodies.

399
00:37:34,369 --> 00:37:39,466
Like a book that nobody has read before,

400
00:37:39,665 --> 00:37:45,828
the twosome are happily reading
each other like never before!

401
00:38:29,618 --> 00:38:37,613
The world often forsakes its own place
and makes way so that these two souls

402
00:38:37,624 --> 00:38:40,301
enjoy moments of solitude,

403
00:38:40,501 --> 00:38:49,506
Even the sky lifts the veil of blue façade to
behold this beautiful sight

404
00:38:49,508 --> 00:38:51,476
– In a fleeting moment.

405
00:38:51,675 --> 00:39:02,484
It’s a celebration of a moment that even
the sky has waited since yesterday of two souls,

406
00:39:02,683 --> 00:39:08,030
Who met just now but give us
a feeling of being lifetime friends.

407
00:39:08,229 --> 00:39:13,324
Like a book that nobody has read before,

408
00:39:13,525 --> 00:39:19,689
the twosome are happily reading
each other like never before!

409
00:39:51,386 --> 00:39:53,878
What happened...
why are you all like this?

410
00:39:55,138 --> 00:40:01,801
The regular tensions that money brings in,
a person has to visit office for new contract

411
00:40:07,898 --> 00:40:12,309
Yeah you can take my word.
Just a minute!

412
00:40:14,152 --> 00:40:18,021
Radha... I am central minister
Venkat Ratnam's son.

413
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:27,379
A person asked me if I had an appointment,
felt like killing him. I just hit him.

414
00:40:27,579 --> 00:40:33,258
I came to talk about the highway
expansion contract. I want that.

415
00:40:33,458 --> 00:40:35,386
Why don't you put up a Tender?
It is open for all

416
00:40:35,587 --> 00:40:37,053
Consumption of Alcohol
is injurious to health

417
00:40:37,252 --> 00:40:44,250
It is difficult if you are in the race.
Just not you.. Anyone. I want this very easily

418
00:40:44,757 --> 00:40:48,643
Very funny, you want others to move
just because you want it.

419
00:40:48,844 --> 00:40:49,812
Put up a better Tender.

420
00:40:50,011 --> 00:40:54,022
I hate competition, I just want that..

421
00:40:54,223 --> 00:40:56,299
You are speaking like a child

422
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:59,402
Really? Then listen.

423
00:40:59,602 --> 00:41:09,018
Your wife and daughter got to reach home
safely from the temple and college.

424
00:41:09,942 --> 00:41:14,622
Daily your sister-in-law, who's a party freak
should come home without an accident

425
00:41:14,821 --> 00:41:17,624
Consumption of Alcohol
is injurious to health

426
00:41:17,823 --> 00:41:20,275
There is a kid..

427
00:41:22,368 --> 00:41:25,672
Looks like a big family.
Difficult to name them all.

428
00:41:25,871 --> 00:41:26,212
Consumption of Alcohol is injurious to health

429
00:41:26,412 --> 00:41:32,617
You are an intelligent businessman and
I know you won't risk all this for a contract.

430
00:41:33,251 --> 00:41:38,555
Consumption of Alcohol
is injurious to health

431
00:41:38,755 --> 00:41:47,461
Don't doubt, I will do it. To save me from
whatever I do, there is a bad father too..

432
00:41:53,932 --> 00:41:57,553
Wonder when these people will leave
the mechanical life  and take spiritual part.

433
00:42:23,704 --> 00:42:27,465
There was not even a small coverage of me
at yesterday's fair opening event.

434
00:42:27,666 --> 00:42:31,594
Except for a small news that,
there was no photo at all.

435
00:42:31,794 --> 00:42:36,831
This is not the first time, it happens
at all events. Not fair at all

436
00:42:38,131 --> 00:42:41,642
Why should people write about us even now?
We can write about ourselves

437
00:42:41,842 --> 00:42:43,769
We?

438
00:42:43,969 --> 00:42:48,971
Social media.. Facebook, Twitter,
why just events...

439
00:42:48,972 --> 00:42:50,466
We can write whatever we want.

440
00:42:55,519 --> 00:42:57,345
Who are you?

441
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,399
Hi!
Hi!

442
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:20,528
Homework?
Post-graduation thesis

443
00:43:24,332 --> 00:43:27,968
For once talk on my behalf
to the high command.

444
00:43:28,168 --> 00:43:32,679
If I lose the minister's post, I can't
face the people in the state, the district.

445
00:43:32,879 --> 00:43:36,057
Sir, please sir, okay. Okay.

446
00:43:36,256 --> 00:43:41,085
Sir, someone close to you has come
to meet you from Hyderabad

447
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:43,087
Tell him to come in

448
00:43:54,479 --> 00:43:55,654
Who?

449
00:43:55,855 --> 00:43:56,947
Harsha

450
00:43:57,147 --> 00:44:02,183
You don't know me. Everyone are
close to politicians, so I said that.

451
00:44:03,818 --> 00:44:07,820
Your son came to my father and
told him to move out  as

452
00:44:07,821 --> 00:44:09,706
he wants the contract at any cost.

453
00:44:09,906 --> 00:44:12,691
If he doesn't stay out, he warned that
he will finish our family.

454
00:44:14,118 --> 00:44:17,945
Smash his face if he comes remotely
close to the family.

455
00:44:20,706 --> 00:44:24,199
Wrong, Should not involve family

456
00:44:27,335 --> 00:44:30,288
Harsha, how come you are here?

457
00:44:31,213 --> 00:44:32,597
I had a small work with your father

458
00:44:32,797 --> 00:44:33,641
Is it!

459
00:44:33,842 --> 00:44:36,842
Daddy, whatever he asks,
you must do it immediately,

460
00:44:36,844 --> 00:44:39,753
Nice guy. Keep talking Harsha,
will be back in five minutes.

461
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:47,216
I was saying something...
Don't come near family.

462
00:44:48,058 --> 00:44:49,943
You are older to him, shouldn't you
tell him that it is wrong?

463
00:44:50,144 --> 00:44:53,720
Harsha! How come you are here?

464
00:44:54,605 --> 00:44:55,947
Had little work with him

465
00:44:56,148 --> 00:45:00,518
He is a nice boy, whatever he asks
please do it immediately.

466
00:45:01,443 --> 00:45:04,645
You keep talking, will just come.
Okay

467
00:45:05,071 --> 00:45:07,230
Where did I stop?

468
00:45:07,782 --> 00:45:09,458
Don't come to the family..

469
00:45:09,658 --> 00:45:13,659
Understand that it is wrong for me
to harm your family,

470
00:45:13,661 --> 00:45:16,947
I did all this so that
you will explain it better to him

471
00:45:17,789 --> 00:45:21,659
He said for every nuisance that he does,
he has a bad father to save him.

472
00:45:22,125 --> 00:45:25,010
To save my family,
there is a bad son too.

473
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:28,663
Bad doesn't mean bad like you.
That is a different type

474
00:45:29,756 --> 00:45:31,915
Yesterday your son came to our office.

475
00:45:32,299 --> 00:45:35,936
Got to know about it in the evening,
learnt about your family in the night

476
00:45:36,135 --> 00:45:39,814
Caught the morning flight to Delhi,
by noon got close to your family.

477
00:45:40,013 --> 00:45:42,173
By evening you have understood
the whole thing.

478
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,567
It got done.. Very easily

479
00:45:44,766 --> 00:45:46,569
Just explain to him.

480
00:45:46,768 --> 00:45:47,985
I think he is only son

481
00:45:48,186 --> 00:45:52,431
Shall I leave, lest your wife, daughter
force me to have dinner.

482
00:45:56,525 --> 00:46:00,561
Harsha, where are you going?
Dinner is ready, you can eat and go

483
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:07,108
Will miss my flight, next time I will eat

484
00:46:11,035 --> 00:46:12,503
Consumption of Alcohol
is injurious to health

485
00:46:12,704 --> 00:46:17,199
The water board engineer's son's
murder is getting complicated.

486
00:46:17,582 --> 00:46:22,636
Family is mum but the public prosecutor
is taking it personally.

487
00:46:22,836 --> 00:46:24,997
We might get three adjournments
Consumption of Alcohol is injurious to health

488
00:46:25,296 --> 00:46:32,334
Find out about the prosecutor's family.
There may be a pampered son or a daughter.

489
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:38,646
Brother

490
00:46:38,848 --> 00:46:42,775
Did you threaten anyone recently
for a contract?

491
00:46:42,976 --> 00:46:47,279
Yes brother.. Highways expansion contract,
Radhanna took it as a prestigious issue

492
00:46:47,479 --> 00:46:51,224
The guy whom you threatened has a son,

493
00:46:52,733 --> 00:46:54,868
he has no fear.

494
00:46:55,067 --> 00:47:03,289
He came to Delhi and warned me.
Don't tell this to Radha, handle it carefully

495
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:06,109
I will tackle him

496
00:47:14,137 --> 00:47:15,017
Tell

497
00:47:15,216 --> 00:47:17,130
Hello Charu, it is me again

498
00:47:17,331 --> 00:47:22,371
I booked a table at 7:30 in a star hotel.
We both are going and that is all.

499
00:47:22,647 --> 00:47:24,785
Apparao, you know that
I do not come for dinners.

500
00:47:24,984 --> 00:47:26,328
How many times shall I say you?

501
00:47:26,529 --> 00:47:29,090
You know that I will not stop asking.
How many times shall I say you?

502
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:30,379
We both are going and that is it.

503
00:47:30,579 --> 00:47:34,307
Bloody Appi, your face will be broken
by acting crazy.

504
00:47:34,904 --> 00:47:37,241
We can have the same cute discussions
there at the table.

505
00:47:37,441 --> 00:47:39,727
We are going and that is it.

506
00:47:41,076 --> 00:47:44,938
I will book table at 7:30 in the hotel and
will come out at 9 if you come.

507
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:51,575
Hello!

508
00:47:51,775 --> 00:47:55,870
Hi, Harsha! Tomorrow evening is
my roommate’s wedding. Here in the city...

509
00:47:56,070 --> 00:47:59,205
She told me to convey this
to you specially

510
00:47:59,406 --> 00:48:01,457
I don't know her well..
You carry on

511
00:48:01,658 --> 00:48:04,293
I am there right?
We both will go together

512
00:48:04,493 --> 00:48:05,709
I will feel a bit awkward

513
00:48:05,911 --> 00:48:11,156
No you won't. You come and pick me.
We are going, going and going

514
00:48:12,707 --> 00:48:17,035
What?
Did someone also call you for dinner, go

515
00:49:04,119 --> 00:49:06,238
Hey!
Hi Charu..

516
00:49:08,247 --> 00:49:10,824
Hi Charu..
Hi!

517
00:49:11,624 --> 00:49:13,594
When did you all come?
Just

518
00:49:13,793 --> 00:49:16,745
It is a sari right...so a bit late.

519
00:49:20,255 --> 00:49:21,224
Decoration is nice.

520
00:49:21,423 --> 00:49:23,601
Will just be here in two minutes
Where?

521
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,918
Rest room
Oh sorry...carry on.

522
00:49:27,845 --> 00:49:29,170
What else..!

523
00:49:59,868 --> 00:50:02,087
Minister?
Hmm!

524
00:50:02,286 --> 00:50:06,215
Someone else's function and I came
with known people. It is not right here.

525
00:50:06,414 --> 00:50:09,574
Who is the girl? Girlfriend?

526
00:50:10,209 --> 00:50:12,511
Will talk later...you leave

527
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:16,329
If you are so scared..
Why did you go to Delhi?

528
00:50:17,881 --> 00:50:26,379
If you have weaknesses like mother,
father, sister.. Why did you come to us?

529
00:50:27,179 --> 00:50:35,135
Bad luck, all the boys went in. Don't know
who will come when and from where.

530
00:50:51,446 --> 00:50:55,448
Mother, father, sister, girlfriend...
that something will happen to them

531
00:50:55,449 --> 00:50:56,958
is not weakness or fear.

532
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,528
It’s Strength!

533
00:51:01,037 --> 00:51:03,448
I told them I will be back in two minutes.

534
00:51:04,498 --> 00:51:06,991
Will go inside and check out the boys

535
00:53:03,209 --> 00:53:04,618
All clear..

536
00:53:05,085 --> 00:53:09,087
All the boys have been set in their places,
I need to fix you now.

537
00:53:09,088 --> 00:53:10,539
What do you mean by set?

538
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:23,089
Next time if you want to plan something,
do it in a better place.

539
00:53:23,557 --> 00:53:27,259
I can finish it in a flow without being
bothered that someone is watching us.

540
00:53:34,064 --> 00:53:37,016
Why so late..
Let's go and wish them

541
00:53:39,485 --> 00:53:40,952
Hi!
Thanks for coming

542
00:53:41,153 --> 00:53:41,954
He is Harsha

543
00:53:42,154 --> 00:53:43,664
Hey!
Hi Charu!

544
00:53:43,863 --> 00:53:44,705
Are you fine uncle?
Fine

545
00:53:44,906 --> 00:53:46,942
Hi!
Harsha.. One snap

546
00:54:08,714 --> 00:54:09,958
Come.. Come..

547
00:54:11,258 --> 00:54:12,185
Hey Charu!

548
00:54:12,384 --> 00:54:15,562
Sudha....after a long time..
How are you?

549
00:54:15,763 --> 00:54:16,313
Fine

550
00:54:16,512 --> 00:54:17,939
Good, he...my husband Kiran

551
00:54:18,138 --> 00:54:19,480
Hi!
Hi!

552
00:54:19,681 --> 00:54:20,107
Your...

553
00:54:20,307 --> 00:54:21,942
My friend, Harsha

554
00:54:22,141 --> 00:54:23,900
Oh!
Hello... Hello

555
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:25,735
Hi Sir, nice meeting you
Hi!

556
00:54:25,936 --> 00:54:26,736
Hi!
Baby

557
00:54:26,937 --> 00:54:28,488
So cute..

558
00:54:28,688 --> 00:54:30,406
Stopping at one right?

559
00:54:30,605 --> 00:54:34,616
Once she goes to school,
will plan for the next

560
00:54:34,817 --> 00:54:38,245
Isn't one enough, why plan again?

561
00:54:38,445 --> 00:54:41,956
How can one be enough?
We can afford another, financially too

562
00:54:42,156 --> 00:54:43,958
Are you ready just because
you can afford?

563
00:54:44,157 --> 00:54:44,415
Charusheela..

564
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:49,337
See Harsha.. If you want another,
why don't you adopt.

565
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:54,005
She talks this way, you don't listen.
Stop it with this girl.

566
00:54:54,206 --> 00:54:59,094
Because you can afford,
adopt a child please

567
00:54:59,293 --> 00:55:02,536
Sure, Sudha shall we go

568
00:55:02,795 --> 00:55:05,473
Okay, bye!
You have not changed at all

569
00:55:05,673 --> 00:55:09,308
If you give birth to second one,
I will kill you

570
00:55:09,508 --> 00:55:11,418
Bye!
Bye!

571
00:55:14,262 --> 00:55:17,315
How can you be so straight?
Did you see his face turn colour?

572
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:21,135
They won't understand till
we speak like that

573
00:55:21,476 --> 00:55:25,404
I too have lots of money..
How many shall I adopt?

574
00:55:25,604 --> 00:55:29,474
First get married and have a child..
after that will tell you

575
00:55:46,827 --> 00:55:49,695
Thanks for a lovely evening
Same here

576
00:55:54,708 --> 00:55:59,119
Shall I go?
Yeah, okay. Good night

577
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:10,128
Harsha

578
00:56:11,178 --> 00:56:12,730
You are beautiful!

579
00:56:12,929 --> 00:56:14,173
In or out?

580
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:16,383
In and out

581
00:56:35,843 --> 00:56:39,356
Oh my beautiful girl
Do you really wanna get on the floor

582
00:56:39,556 --> 00:56:43,006
Oh my glittering pearl
Let’s get on and rock and roll

583
00:56:43,207 --> 00:56:46,739
Oh my beautiful girl
Do you really wanna get on the floor

584
00:56:46,938 --> 00:56:50,624
Oh my glittering pearl
Let’s get on and rock and roll

585
00:56:58,011 --> 00:57:01,533
Oh my beautiful girl
Do you really wanna get on the floor

586
00:57:01,734 --> 00:57:05,451
Oh my glittering pearl
Let’s get on and rock and roll

587
00:57:05,847 --> 00:57:12,945
O Charusheela, my dream girl
You are the adult love school

588
00:57:17,248 --> 00:57:24,193
Like a mafia of jasmines,
you heated me up

589
00:57:27,487 --> 00:57:34,683
Hey hot hot hot hot mexican tequila
You are found like the childhood fantasy

590
00:57:34,884 --> 00:57:42,629
You resemble in parts like Indian masala
Is your smile a love symbol

591
00:57:42,828 --> 00:57:49,999
O Charusheela, my dream girl
You are the adult love school

592
00:57:50,283 --> 00:57:57,312
Like a mafia of jasmines,
you heated me up

593
00:57:57,511 --> 00:58:00,665
Oh my beautiful girl
Do you really wanna get on the floor

594
00:58:00,866 --> 00:58:04,570
Oh my glittering pearl
Let’s get on and rock and roll

595
00:58:26,565 --> 00:58:39,226
Hey, kick is new like the coniac
Beauty blank cheque is now in my hands

596
00:58:41,521 --> 00:58:48,557
Beautiful statue sculpted from
the Mercury cloud with flowers

597
00:58:48,758 --> 00:58:56,182
Glamour dictionary written by God of love
is the scenery of the fold on your waist

598
00:58:56,684 --> 00:59:03,757
O Charusheela, my dream girl
You are the adult love school

599
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:11,212
Like a mafia of jasmines,
you heated me up

600
00:59:33,288 --> 00:59:46,102
You are the swan jumping like Love missile
The age is like butter over Wild fire

601
00:59:48,082 --> 00:59:55,107
Eyes have popped up on my finger tips
When touched your tender beauty

602
00:59:55,449 --> 01:00:02,866
My eyelids have caught the swords
when you are found like a deer

603
01:00:03,198 --> 01:00:10,438
O Charusheela, my dream girl
You are the adult love school

604
01:00:10,803 --> 01:00:18,861
Like a mafia of jasmines,
you heated me up

605
01:00:32,361 --> 01:00:37,230
You left us helpless state

606
01:00:45,285 --> 01:00:48,405
What Narayana Rao,
how come you are here?

607
01:00:50,374 --> 01:00:55,259
This year six farmers committed suicide
in the neighbouring villages

608
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:59,788
I heard about it. What can we do?
There are no rains.

609
01:01:00,046 --> 01:01:05,710
If the water in the lake is accessible,
irrigation is possible and so

610
01:01:06,551 --> 01:01:11,438
Hey, you didn't send stock to Chintalpudi?
Send it properly from next month.

611
01:01:11,639 --> 01:01:13,523
What else Narayana?

612
01:01:13,723 --> 01:01:18,859
What more can I tell you other than
the farmers dying off drought?

613
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:24,030
Hey, summer is arriving, work at nights too
and send the stock to the entire district.

614
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:24,614
Okay brother

615
01:01:24,814 --> 01:01:25,991
What about the lake?

616
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:34,195
That lake is mine. Your problem is this
being made with the lake water.

617
01:01:34,196 --> 01:01:35,482
Will kill all if you talk about the lake.

618
01:01:35,782 --> 01:01:38,859
Go. Go away..

619
01:01:42,368 --> 01:01:46,370
You are leaving your own village.
Where will you go with two kids

620
01:01:46,371 --> 01:01:48,506
and what will you do? Listen to me.

621
01:01:48,706 --> 01:01:53,709
What will I do here?
We have to depend on agriculture,

622
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:57,998
and will have to drink
pesticides if there are no rains.

623
01:01:58,213 --> 01:02:03,351
Somehow we will bring water from the lake
to our fields, listen to me.

624
01:02:03,552 --> 01:02:10,840
He died finally waiting with that hope for
15 years. You still say it will rain?

625
01:02:20,064 --> 01:02:22,557
520

626
01:02:23,273 --> 01:02:26,518
Aren't you ashamed?
Won't you change?

627
01:02:27,026 --> 01:02:30,411
When all are leaving, there should be
a count, isn't it? Why feel ashamed?

628
01:02:30,611 --> 01:02:32,079
Okay..

629
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:35,650
Do one thing..
go stop them, the count will come down.

630
01:02:41,161 --> 01:02:44,797
I got a match and all in family
are forcing to get married

631
01:02:44,997 --> 01:02:48,534
What are you ordering
that's what I am checking?

632
01:02:50,461 --> 01:02:52,370
Surprise!!

633
01:02:52,878 --> 01:02:57,874
There is an article on Indian billionaires
and their successors. Look who's in it!

634
01:03:02,927 --> 01:03:04,753
Who is it!

635
01:03:08,139 --> 01:03:09,758
It's Harsha..

636
01:03:11,808 --> 01:03:18,306
"R" industries Ltd. Ravikant's son,
he is so simple with you. It is unbelievable.

637
01:04:26,531 --> 01:04:28,457
Hi!

638
01:04:28,657 --> 01:04:29,790
Is something wrong?

639
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:31,041
No... Nothing

640
01:04:31,241 --> 01:04:32,942
Then why are you avoiding me?

641
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:36,379
I was busy caught up in something...
That's all

642
01:04:36,578 --> 01:04:37,947
Sure?

643
01:04:38,164 --> 01:04:39,531
Yeah..

644
01:04:41,291 --> 01:04:42,299
Charusheela...

645
01:04:42,499 --> 01:04:43,675
uh..

646
01:04:43,875 --> 01:04:45,326
I love you.

647
01:04:47,671 --> 01:04:50,164
life has never been interesting

648
01:04:51,005 --> 01:04:53,165
Days and hours just passed by

649
01:04:54,051 --> 01:04:57,253
But after meeting you it's interesting.

650
01:05:00,055 --> 01:05:02,548
To be honest every moment is fabulous.

651
01:05:03,683 --> 01:05:05,800
We both think alike

652
01:05:07,017 --> 01:05:08,968
Laugh alike,

653
01:05:09,644 --> 01:05:11,678
Feel alike,

654
01:05:11,979 --> 01:05:13,765
We are so similar..

655
01:05:16,442 --> 01:05:18,935
If we both become one
it will be good Charusheela

656
01:05:20,652 --> 01:05:22,786
We both are not same

657
01:05:22,987 --> 01:05:24,981
That can never happen

658
01:05:26,239 --> 01:05:28,526
Do you know your village?

659
01:05:28,991 --> 01:05:30,360
Don't know?

660
01:05:30,867 --> 01:05:34,530
You grew up without knowing your roots..

661
01:05:35,496 --> 01:05:37,990
Devarakota is your village

662
01:05:38,458 --> 01:05:41,760
My village, how do you know?

663
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:43,953
That is my village too

664
01:05:44,712 --> 01:05:54,335
You are Ravi Kant’s son, the man
who forgot his village earning crores.

665
01:05:55,927 --> 01:06:01,049
I am daughter of Narayana Rao,
a man who lives for his village.

666
01:06:02,016 --> 01:06:06,094
We live in two different worlds,
we can never meet

667
01:06:06,478 --> 01:06:14,142
You said days and years just passed by,
this too will pass.

668
01:06:16,317 --> 01:06:17,852
Okay Harsha

669
01:06:43,797 --> 01:06:45,307
Shocking Karthik...

670
01:06:45,507 --> 01:06:48,507
We didn't get the contract
but someone else put up a tender

671
01:06:48,509 --> 01:06:50,586
in our Company's name and we got it.

672
01:06:50,968 --> 01:06:54,213
Who must have gone for
the second Tender and why?

673
01:06:54,639 --> 01:06:56,522
I am also not able to understand

674
01:06:56,722 --> 01:06:58,633
Even you don't know Madhav Rao?

675
01:06:59,224 --> 01:07:00,884
Harsha did it sir,

676
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:02,761
Harsha!

677
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:07,354
One day he came up to me
and said we need

678
01:07:07,355 --> 01:07:10,074
to put up a second Tender
without anyone's knowledge

679
01:07:10,275 --> 01:07:13,477
That is why I didn't tell you.
I am very sorry sir

680
01:07:15,654 --> 01:07:17,330
Sir,
Not this blue colour

681
01:07:17,530 --> 01:07:18,497
Sister, please give

682
01:07:18,697 --> 01:07:20,582
Why don't you practice yoga?
It keeps you healthy

683
01:07:20,783 --> 01:07:22,942
Please sister

684
01:07:24,117 --> 01:07:25,568
Harsha..

685
01:07:29,164 --> 01:07:34,117
A contract we didn't expect came to us...
because of you.

686
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:37,427
But why did you opt for a second Tender?

687
01:07:37,627 --> 01:07:41,629
You've been wanting the contract
for a long time and

688
01:07:41,630 --> 01:07:43,223
I felt another person
wouldn't give it up easily.

689
01:07:43,424 --> 01:07:49,426
I suspected that our Company's
Tender quote would be tipped...

690
01:07:49,428 --> 01:07:50,629
it turned out to be true.

691
01:07:51,471 --> 01:07:54,523
From our Company? Who?

692
01:07:54,723 --> 01:07:58,526
No idea. There must be someone
who must have succumbed to greed.

693
01:07:58,726 --> 01:08:01,012
Anyway we have bagged the contract.

694
01:08:01,769 --> 01:08:03,863
I know your capability

695
01:08:04,064 --> 01:08:08,949
Even without coming to office and not
Showing any interest, you've done this.

696
01:08:09,150 --> 01:08:15,104
Imagine if you were the boss..
You can do wonders. It is time Harsha.

697
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:20,875
I need some time.
I want to go somewhere for a few days

698
01:08:21,076 --> 01:08:26,280
take your time, explore any part
of the world, enjoy, relax.

699
01:08:27,913 --> 01:08:31,366
But return and tell me you are ready

700
01:08:38,981 --> 01:08:42,892
Hi Harsha! Good job, well done!

701
01:08:48,803 --> 01:08:51,850
Do you know what happens if family gets
to know that tip from office went from you?

702
01:08:53,030 --> 01:08:55,740
Even uncle and aunt would be on roads
in shame along with you.

703
01:08:56,457 --> 01:08:59,615
Do not play with family.
What do you want?

704
01:09:00,083 --> 01:09:03,962
That chair?
It will not come if you try to snatch.

705
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:05,988
You have to earn it Karthik.

706
01:09:10,795 --> 01:09:13,554
Till yesterday we thought
the contract was ours.

707
01:09:13,754 --> 01:09:17,766
We even bought a member in their family
and quoted far less than them in the Tender.

708
01:09:17,966 --> 01:09:19,433
What happened suddenly?

709
01:09:19,634 --> 01:09:21,585
He has a son

710
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:25,647
After warning him about the contract,

711
01:09:25,847 --> 01:09:29,090
he went to Delhi and warned your father

712
01:09:30,434 --> 01:09:34,595
He told me to handle it
without your knowledge..

713
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:37,305
We also went

714
01:09:38,481 --> 01:09:40,433
He is “ITEM"... boss

715
01:09:41,233 --> 01:09:45,394
He did it with style and without noise..

716
01:09:47,779 --> 01:09:52,024
He put up a second Tender
without anyone knowing about it.

717
01:09:53,492 --> 01:09:59,321
I want him, now let's go

718
01:10:04,084 --> 01:10:10,513
Has the entire planet earth opened
its arms, and asked you to hug it?

719
01:10:10,714 --> 01:10:15,683
Lo, listen to that call, take that turn
and step forward and run…

720
01:10:15,883 --> 01:10:21,938
Has the dream burst out of your heart
And create a golden path for you…?

721
01:10:22,138 --> 01:10:26,607
This is the moment to pay back your debt
Go to them like a ray of sunshine..

722
01:10:26,807 --> 01:10:30,809
What is your heart leaving behind
and where is it going?

723
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:33,112
Does your heart stop to think
even for a second…?

724
01:10:33,312 --> 01:10:38,241
Your humanity is your wealth,
Go forth and serve others…

725
01:10:38,441 --> 01:10:44,412
Don’t hesitate and don’t look back again,
the smile on your face is your first victory lap...

726
01:10:44,613 --> 01:10:49,499
This is the path your heart is searching for,
Go for the good (that’s about to happen)..

727
01:10:49,699 --> 01:10:56,703
Your ambition is the fuel
that pierces the darkness in the world.

728
01:10:56,704 --> 01:11:00,841
Let your life rain love and compassion

729
01:11:01,041 --> 01:11:12,140
Your aim always is to help the society who else
can strive for everyone’s safety other than you?

730
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:18,354
Your child-like innocence is enough to spread
the love to each and everyone in the world

731
01:11:18,554 --> 01:11:23,398
To the heart that’s waiting for you,
(You) become a wind and get going…

732
01:11:23,598 --> 01:11:29,653
What’s in need and what’s not in need
You can distinguish between them

733
01:11:29,853 --> 01:11:34,740
Like rain that feeds the sapling that needs it
(You) get ready and get going…

734
01:11:34,941 --> 01:11:42,945
Go forth, oh Wealthy Man…
Get going, Oh wealthy man,

735
01:11:42,946 --> 01:11:46,249
let your aims get fulfilled!

736
01:11:46,449 --> 01:11:52,452
Go forth, oh Wealthy Man…
Get going, oh Wealthy Man

737
01:11:52,453 --> 01:11:58,991
Let all your dreams come true!
Jai ho! Jai ho!

738
01:12:43,740 --> 01:12:45,817
Who are you? Leave me

739
01:12:53,372 --> 01:12:55,657
Go... go...go... go...

740
01:12:56,375 --> 01:12:57,008
Uncle

741
01:12:57,209 --> 01:13:09,751
Two crows are flying to Hyderabad
to file a case on us and the lake

742
01:13:10,885 --> 01:13:16,714
Even before they reach,
stop the bus and kill them.

743
01:13:44,075 --> 01:13:46,711
You collected a lot of data of our family.

744
01:13:46,911 --> 01:13:50,655
I too don't know how much we have,

745
01:13:51,248 --> 01:13:52,756
how much do we have?

746
01:13:52,957 --> 01:13:56,284
Lot of it, poor people's blood

747
01:13:57,419 --> 01:14:00,496
Then you won't give your blood?

748
01:14:02,006 --> 01:14:03,624
Hello,

749
01:14:04,924 --> 01:14:08,042
Why are you blocking the road?
Remove the vehicles.

750
01:14:13,305 --> 01:14:13,772
Won't Give

751
01:14:13,972 --> 01:14:15,440
I have told you to remove it

752
01:14:15,641 --> 01:14:17,050
Hey...

753
01:14:23,522 --> 01:14:25,140
What are you doing here?

754
01:14:25,355 --> 01:14:26,681
Brother,

755
01:14:27,315 --> 01:14:28,892
he is the one

756
01:14:29,608 --> 01:14:31,184
he is the one

757
01:14:33,611 --> 01:14:36,747
Every time you do this,
don't you get slightly bored?

758
01:14:36,947 --> 01:14:44,569
He is the one who
went to Delhi and hit us

759
01:14:50,291 --> 01:14:53,675
All of you at one place...what luck!

760
01:14:53,876 --> 01:14:55,952
Minister's son?

761
01:14:56,336 --> 01:15:01,999
I went to Delhi and told your dad to give you
a piece of mind, but he sent these men

762
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:07,837
I told them in a way they understand
but looks like I have to tell them separately.

763
01:15:11,723 --> 01:15:15,441
I am going on an urgent work to the village.
Listen, leave them and remove the vehicles

764
01:15:15,641 --> 01:15:18,385
Kill them and this fellow also together

765
01:15:19,187 --> 01:15:23,557
Everyone is waiting in the bus.
It is better if we finish it fast..

766
01:15:24,273 --> 01:15:26,599
Come.. come.. come.. come on..

767
01:17:04,826 --> 01:17:08,154
Has everyone understood in the family,
anyone left?

768
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:14,868
We are clearing the vehicles... sir.

769
01:17:34,766 --> 01:17:36,925
Right, right

770
01:17:53,046 --> 01:17:54,013
Devarakota

771
01:17:54,213 --> 01:17:56,163
Devarakota stop has come,
get down.

772
01:18:00,008 --> 01:18:01,584
Get the cycle down

773
01:18:08,264 --> 01:18:09,673
Right, right

774
01:18:14,311 --> 01:18:15,988
Which way leads to Devarakota?

775
01:18:16,188 --> 01:18:17,989
Go straight and turn to the right

776
01:18:18,189 --> 01:18:19,490
What work do you have in Devarakota?

777
01:18:19,690 --> 01:18:21,350
I have work in the village

778
01:18:24,276 --> 01:18:26,727
Your count has failed

779
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:34,501
Yes, I have been seeing people leaving
the village but not coming in

780
01:18:34,701 --> 01:18:37,628
521

781
01:18:37,828 --> 01:18:39,921
My count has gone ahead

782
01:18:40,121 --> 01:18:45,966
How many stories and sufferings
this motherland has in her moist eyes,

783
01:18:46,167 --> 01:18:50,970
who could know? Only your soul can see
the fire she has hidden inside her heart.

784
01:18:51,170 --> 01:18:57,433
Only your hands have the warmth to
wipe off her tears and stand by her.

785
01:18:57,634 --> 01:19:02,478
Let her know those pain full times are over,
now her own son has come.

786
01:19:02,678 --> 01:19:13,236
Go forth, oh Wealthy Man…Get going
Let your aims get fulfilled! Jai ho!

787
01:19:13,436 --> 01:19:23,443
Go forth, oh Wealthy Man…
Get going, oh Wealthy Man

788
01:19:23,444 --> 01:19:25,520
Let all your dreams come true!
Jai ho! Jai ho!

789
01:19:43,001 --> 01:19:44,008
What happened?

790
01:19:44,209 --> 01:19:47,969
I fell unconscious, he helped me,
brought me home

791
01:19:48,170 --> 01:19:50,080
Namaste! Babu

792
01:19:52,590 --> 01:19:54,891
Instead of sending her so far,
why can't men go?

793
01:19:55,091 --> 01:19:57,476
I am the only man in this house.

794
01:19:57,677 --> 01:20:02,190
My only son died in the military and the
Government gave a compensation

795
01:20:02,390 --> 01:20:06,984
with which we grow vegetables.
She cultivates them and sells them...

796
01:20:07,184 --> 01:20:10,094
and looks after us and
the children with that money.

797
01:20:22,647 --> 01:20:24,869
Dear!

798
01:20:25,376 --> 01:20:26,717
Who are you dear?

799
01:20:28,058 --> 01:20:31,506
I came on a small work in the village.
As I do not know where to sleep…

800
01:20:31,797 --> 01:20:33,555
Are there any lodges nearby
in this surroundings?

801
01:20:33,766 --> 01:20:36,531
How would lodges be
in such an isolated village?

802
01:20:36,826 --> 01:20:38,771
There as an elder person by name
Narayana Rao here.

803
01:20:38,971 --> 01:20:42,862
He arranges shelter in the house opposite
his, whenever new people come here.

804
01:20:43,062 --> 01:20:44,787
I will take you there,
if you have no objection.

805
01:20:45,087 --> 01:20:46,053
Hey..
sir,

806
01:20:46,253 --> 01:20:49,639
Download two sacks at the tree
and two at the entrance.. I am coming

807
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:53,841
Babu called. He told me to send
four good photos of her to the town.

808
01:20:53,843 --> 01:20:56,811
Heard there are good alliances over there

809
01:20:57,011 --> 01:20:59,188
Today we need to spray insecticide
on the field

810
01:20:59,388 --> 01:21:03,483
The filed...
big work as if you are cultivating gold

811
01:21:03,684 --> 01:21:05,343
What are you talking?

812
01:21:05,643 --> 01:21:11,972
I will take care of the field, you take her..
See what she wants

813
01:21:14,817 --> 01:21:16,476
Narayana Rao

814
01:21:16,776 --> 01:21:19,614
He has come here on work,
he did not know where to stay

815
01:21:19,778 --> 01:21:21,287
and slept last night at the temple

816
01:21:21,488 --> 01:21:22,981
Narayana Rao

817
01:21:23,906 --> 01:21:25,999
Who are you?
What work do you have here?

818
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:29,201
I am Harshavardhan,
studying about remote villages.

819
01:21:29,203 --> 01:21:31,629
Want to stay here for a few days
and study the conditions.

820
01:21:31,829 --> 01:21:36,741
Crestfallen faces in a dilapidated house,
what more is there to know

821
01:21:37,791 --> 01:21:41,135
There aren't many comforts
for people like you,

822
01:21:41,336 --> 01:21:44,095
if you don't mind
you can stay in our house

823
01:21:44,296 --> 01:21:47,390
I heard no one stays in that house,
if you don't mind I will stay there.

824
01:21:47,591 --> 01:21:49,058
That house has gone bad,

825
01:21:49,258 --> 01:21:51,601
not fit for living.
Why don't you stay with us?

826
01:21:51,801 --> 01:21:53,627
It is okay, I will feel free there

827
01:21:55,679 --> 01:21:58,314
Show him the house and see
what he wants  - Okay brother

828
01:21:58,515 --> 01:21:59,691
Go Babu
Please come

829
01:21:59,891 --> 01:22:02,734
Babu, do come home for supper

830
01:22:02,934 --> 01:22:05,386
Okay..
Let us go

831
01:22:13,442 --> 01:22:15,701
Our relative's house,

832
01:22:15,902 --> 01:22:18,163
25 years back they left to the city
and settled there.

833
01:22:18,363 --> 01:22:20,080
From that day it's vacant

834
01:22:20,281 --> 01:22:21,540
You can be in that room

835
01:22:21,741 --> 01:22:23,292
In case you need anything tell me.

836
01:22:23,492 --> 01:22:24,333
Okay

837
01:22:24,534 --> 01:22:26,835
There is a distant relative,
good for nothing who stays here.

838
01:22:26,937 --> 01:22:29,581
If he bothers you, let me know.

839
01:22:34,707 --> 01:22:39,343
Oh you are new entry here, supposed
to stay with me. I am Raja Ratnam

840
01:22:39,545 --> 01:22:40,511
They told me some other name

841
01:22:40,711 --> 01:22:45,014
They must have called me an idiot.
What else?

842
01:22:45,215 --> 01:22:47,016
What do you do?

843
01:22:47,216 --> 01:22:48,059
If I don't do anything,
shouldn't I survive?

844
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:49,643
Just asked casually

845
01:22:49,843 --> 01:22:50,644
Where is your family?

846
01:22:50,844 --> 01:22:57,924
Am I a waste if I don't have a family?
They have hinted that I am an idiot.

847
01:23:05,604 --> 01:23:11,100
Tummalapalli ZPTC Satti is talking
too much on the mike,

848
01:23:11,402 --> 01:23:15,770
bring him to the mango orchard once

849
01:23:16,571 --> 01:23:17,247
Tell me brother

850
01:23:17,447 --> 01:23:19,708
Our political situation is not good.

851
01:23:19,908 --> 01:23:24,586
High Command thinks that the district is
suffering on account of us..

852
01:23:24,786 --> 01:23:30,131
If this continues the minister's post will be
in danger.  It will be tight in the next poll.

853
01:23:30,331 --> 01:23:34,969
To survive politically we need to do
something  for the village.. Sasi.

854
01:23:35,169 --> 01:23:39,996
Can't we stay in politics if we don't do
anything? Who will come?

855
01:23:40,923 --> 01:23:45,416
Do something but let's not take a risk

856
01:23:47,303 --> 01:23:51,254
He's talking something new,
says we should do something

857
01:23:54,057 --> 01:23:57,235
Will not do..
Who will come.. Let’s see

858
01:23:57,335 --> 01:24:01,336
In the next one month,
summer will be at its peak.

859
01:24:01,338 --> 01:24:03,873
Scared if we can ever do
something for the school

860
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:06,791
You fear is warranted.

861
01:24:07,384 --> 01:24:13,479
Toured all the neighbouring villages
but couldn't collect even a 50 thousand fund

862
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:16,680
There is an empty tobacco godown
in the neighbouring village.

863
01:24:16,681 --> 01:24:18,900
Why don't we ask them
and run the classes this year

864
01:24:19,101 --> 01:24:21,802
How much will it cost
to build the fallen school?

865
01:24:23,145 --> 01:24:25,596
Around seven, eight lakhs

866
01:24:34,153 --> 01:24:35,538
No need son

867
01:24:35,738 --> 01:24:42,026
You came to see the village, this is
normal to us. We will face these problems.

868
01:24:43,910 --> 01:24:48,781
If we don't share other person's misery,
what is the point of living here.

869
01:24:52,541 --> 01:24:55,868
At least think of the children and
begin the work immediately

870
01:25:00,631 --> 01:25:02,182
Why only our village?

871
01:25:02,382 --> 01:25:06,060
I just wanted to come
to some remote village.

872
01:25:06,260 --> 01:25:11,172
My friend, Appa Rao is your relative and
he suggested this village. I just came

873
01:25:12,722 --> 01:25:19,026
We thought he is a vagabond
but he is so responsible towards the village.

874
01:25:19,227 --> 01:25:21,278
Ask him to come once when it is possible.
Okay brother

875
01:25:21,478 --> 01:25:23,305
It has been a long time since I saw him

876
01:25:25,606 --> 01:25:29,034
If I am not here, these people will not even
lift a twig.  How much work I manage here...

877
01:25:29,234 --> 01:25:31,535
Are you just coming Apparao?
Yes Aunt

878
01:25:31,736 --> 01:25:32,828
Are your parents doing well?

879
01:25:33,030 --> 01:25:37,147
Yes, but why should they worry when
I am there for them. They are highly happy.

880
01:25:57,263 --> 01:25:58,797
What man?

881
01:26:00,015 --> 01:26:01,316
Uncle
How are you uncle?

882
01:26:01,516 --> 01:26:03,509
Fine, fine

883
01:26:05,228 --> 01:26:09,822
When you would loiter around as a child,
I was worried for you

884
01:26:10,022 --> 01:26:16,035
but you sent your friend and helped
the village,  I feel very happy.

885
01:26:16,236 --> 01:26:16,993
My friend..?

886
01:26:17,193 --> 01:26:19,287
You didn't know?

887
01:26:19,488 --> 01:26:23,123
Why will I not know my friend?
I only sent him, but where is he?

888
01:26:23,323 --> 01:26:24,749
Opposite house

889
01:26:24,949 --> 01:26:26,775
Will go and say hi

890
01:26:28,369 --> 01:26:29,045
Harsha...

891
01:26:29,245 --> 01:26:30,253
How come you are here?

892
01:26:30,453 --> 01:26:32,755
Your family said you have gone on
a holiday. What are you doing here?

893
01:26:32,955 --> 01:26:33,422
This is my village too

894
01:26:33,623 --> 01:26:35,466
You never told me this

895
01:26:35,666 --> 01:26:36,842
I too got to know recently.

896
01:26:37,042 --> 01:26:38,843
My family left to the city years ago,

897
01:26:39,043 --> 01:26:40,844
I came here to do something
for the village.

898
01:26:41,045 --> 01:26:43,044
If they come to know I am son of him,
they might react differently so I told them

899
01:26:43,046 --> 01:26:44,263
I am here because of you

900
01:26:44,463 --> 01:26:44,805
Oh

901
01:26:45,006 --> 01:26:46,139
You maintain it that way

902
01:26:46,339 --> 01:26:47,598
Looks like everything
is happening for me

903
01:26:47,799 --> 01:26:49,810
Actually I am trying to woo Charu
but she isn't falling for me

904
01:26:50,010 --> 01:26:52,228
Now because of you,
their family will think highly of me.

905
01:26:52,428 --> 01:26:56,004
As long as they live in that illusion,
I should work towards making Charu mine.

906
01:27:16,111 --> 01:27:17,979
You are stubborn Narayana

907
01:27:19,281 --> 01:27:25,502
I said it is not possible but
you started work on this school

908
01:27:25,702 --> 01:27:28,254
How can I possibly do
so much on my own?

909
01:27:28,454 --> 01:27:34,700
That boy came from elsewhere and is
constructing it with his money

910
01:27:46,133 --> 01:27:47,058
Who are you?

911
01:27:47,259 --> 01:27:48,476
Harshavardhan..

912
01:27:48,678 --> 01:27:49,793
You?

913
01:27:53,056 --> 01:27:54,840
Sasi

914
01:27:55,514 --> 01:27:57,966
Heard you are doing this
on your own.

915
01:27:58,310 --> 01:27:59,693
You have too much money?

916
01:27:59,893 --> 01:28:01,594
I have a lot

917
01:28:06,607 --> 01:28:08,350
Why in this village?

918
01:28:11,069 --> 01:28:14,069
Why are you asking questions
instead of feeling happy

919
01:28:14,071 --> 01:28:15,480
that something good is being done

920
01:28:19,032 --> 01:28:25,378
You are constructing this school.
Later they will like demand this and that

921
01:28:25,579 --> 01:28:26,796
What will they ask?

922
01:28:26,996 --> 01:28:32,324
School, temple, road, water,
What, why don't we give it?

923
01:28:35,837 --> 01:28:37,595
You are fun.

924
01:28:37,795 --> 01:28:39,538
Come home sometime..

925
01:28:40,715 --> 01:28:41,932
Will treat you with a hunter fowl

926
01:28:42,132 --> 01:28:44,501
I will be staying here only..
Will come some day

927
01:28:49,554 --> 01:28:54,900
Who is he? Why is he doing all this?
Keep an eye on him

928
01:28:55,101 --> 01:28:55,984
Let him do.

929
01:28:56,184 --> 01:28:58,027
Brother from Delhi wants us to
do something for the village.

930
01:28:58,228 --> 01:29:01,805
We won't do, we will put all that
he does into our account

931
01:29:10,819 --> 01:29:17,207
Please think of this road...
people are not able to walk

932
01:29:17,408 --> 01:29:19,710
Be ashamed, how you can ask
whatever that comes to your mind..

933
01:29:19,910 --> 01:29:21,627
Please don't misunderstand.

934
01:29:21,827 --> 01:29:26,714
They are all tired, the moment they saw
some hope they just asked. That's all

935
01:29:26,915 --> 01:29:29,741
It is the road right? We will do it

936
01:29:32,919 --> 01:29:35,920
If you keep doing this,
there will be one after the other.

937
01:29:35,922 --> 01:29:37,598
There are many problems here

938
01:29:37,798 --> 01:29:39,541
We will do everything Sir.

939
01:29:41,050 --> 01:29:46,479
I have been told by a person that if
we have more wealth than necessary,

940
01:29:46,679 --> 01:29:48,630
we should adopt someone.

941
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:55,510
But with the wealth I have, I will adopt
not just one or two people, but the village.

942
01:30:03,983 --> 01:30:07,185
I am adopting this village from today..

943
01:30:08,486 --> 01:30:14,232
Will make this tired and closed place
into a beautiful and a happy one.

944
01:30:37,050 --> 01:30:44,355
Like the red hot sun in the afternoon,
this bright beautiful land is shining like me.

945
01:30:44,555 --> 01:30:51,610
The dream that ignited me wants me
to roar like an army of million warriors.

946
01:30:51,810 --> 01:30:59,157
I’ve got wings and there are no limits now,
even the sky has to be torn down.

947
01:30:59,357 --> 01:31:07,079
I’m running wild around the world
with the force of thousand horses.

948
01:31:07,279 --> 01:31:13,916
As a pure early morning breeze,
I’m hosting the flag of happiness and joy.

949
01:31:14,118 --> 01:31:21,632
Come awake, let’s get awaken,
go awake up, just wake up

950
01:31:21,832 --> 01:31:30,622
Come awake, let’s get awaken,
go awake up, just wake up

951
01:32:04,070 --> 01:32:08,072
After searching through the depths
of my soul,

952
01:32:08,073 --> 01:32:11,667
wanting to discover myself,
I’ve finally found myself.

953
01:32:11,868 --> 01:32:19,299
Now I’ll share myself, my love, and move
like a fire ball in all the eight directions.

954
01:32:19,499 --> 01:32:26,970
I’ll come like the most beautiful aroma
which will squeeze your heart with joy.

955
01:32:27,171 --> 01:32:34,016
I’ll come as the rain to flourish every flower,
every tree and every inch of my land.

956
01:32:34,217 --> 01:32:37,852
I’ll turn this desert into a beautiful garden...

957
01:32:38,053 --> 01:32:47,052
Come awake, let’s get awaken,
go awake up, just wake up

958
01:33:31,633 --> 01:33:37,637
Like the most unselfish tree,
giving us all its fruits and flowers

959
01:33:37,638 --> 01:33:39,272
without expecting nothing in return,

960
01:33:39,473 --> 01:33:44,474
So there is no meaning,
if we are indifferent to each other

961
01:33:44,476 --> 01:33:46,862
and don’t treat our fellowmen
as human beings.

962
01:33:47,062 --> 01:33:54,575
My blood will boil and my bones are ignited
just to see any tear drop around me.

963
01:33:54,775 --> 01:34:02,122
My soul feels tortured if I don’t do any good
to my fellow beings and share their pain.

964
01:34:02,323 --> 01:34:05,458
I’ll just keep giving whatever I have...

965
01:34:05,658 --> 01:34:23,746
Come awake, let’s get awaken,
go awake up, just wake up

966
01:34:34,147 --> 01:34:36,307
Sister!
Swati...

967
01:34:42,735 --> 01:34:45,287
Is your course over?
Do you need to go again?

968
01:34:45,487 --> 01:34:46,746
Almost done father.

969
01:34:46,947 --> 01:34:49,947
I have to organise a team
in a week's time

970
01:34:49,949 --> 01:34:52,251
and execute small
developmental technicalities.

971
01:34:52,451 --> 01:34:57,453
But I noticed that a lot of stuff
that I learnt in college has already

972
01:34:57,455 --> 01:34:58,840
been implemented here.

973
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:00,591
Found it surprising!

974
01:35:00,791 --> 01:35:05,510
I have never seen any change
so far over here, but in three months.

975
01:35:05,511 --> 01:35:07,512
How is it possible dad?

976
01:35:07,712 --> 01:35:13,709
God must have pitied our situation.

977
01:35:14,383 --> 01:35:18,211
A great man has come here
and adopted our village

978
01:35:19,221 --> 01:35:26,884
He's been working day and night
without a wink to develop our village

979
01:35:29,019 --> 01:35:31,929
Come for lunch

980
01:35:53,912 --> 01:35:54,295
Sit down

981
01:35:54,496 --> 01:35:54,921
Came for this

982
01:35:55,122 --> 01:35:56,172
Babu sit down

983
01:35:56,372 --> 01:35:58,133
Serve
Okay father

984
01:35:58,333 --> 01:35:59,949
My daughter....

985
01:36:02,752 --> 01:36:06,805
This boy is doing everything...
He is Apparao's friend

986
01:36:07,005 --> 01:36:09,374
They know each other well.

987
01:36:16,221 --> 01:36:19,588
You met at my birthday party.

988
01:36:20,015 --> 01:36:22,651
I introduced you both to each other,
forgot so quickly?

989
01:36:22,851 --> 01:36:25,528
Forget about birthdays and
think about wedding

990
01:36:25,728 --> 01:36:27,969
Okay aunt,
how many times will you repeat?

991
01:36:31,357 --> 01:36:35,617
I always wanted to do something for
the village. I met a friend and inspired him..

992
01:36:35,817 --> 01:36:37,994
Hey don't get emotional...
Please, I don't like all this

993
01:36:38,194 --> 01:36:41,246
Isn't your village my village..
Same, same villages.

994
01:36:41,446 --> 01:36:44,331
Just go and sleep happily,
don't get emotional.

995
01:36:44,532 --> 01:36:46,358
Sleep tight and goodnight

996
01:36:58,793 --> 01:37:00,536
What is all this?

997
01:37:01,461 --> 01:37:03,120
Why did you come here?

998
01:37:04,506 --> 01:37:06,165
This too is my village right?

999
01:37:07,633 --> 01:37:10,851
You didn't know you had a village
till I told you.

1000
01:37:11,052 --> 01:37:14,046
Suddenly it has become your village
and showering affection.

1001
01:37:14,888 --> 01:37:17,522
For you and your family,
it is always business.

1002
01:37:17,722 --> 01:37:20,724
You said you love me,
when I rejected you came here

1003
01:37:20,725 --> 01:37:21,983
and you are getting close to my family.

1004
01:37:22,185 --> 01:37:26,221
You know their weakness is
the village and you are investing on it.

1005
01:37:27,022 --> 01:37:31,891
You think they will fall for you and
get me married to you. It is your plan.

1006
01:37:32,151 --> 01:37:36,870
That will never happen.
Your investment on this village go waste.

1007
01:37:37,070 --> 01:37:41,566
It isn't late, leave as soon as possible,

1008
01:37:41,865 --> 01:37:44,317
you can save your balance amount.

1009
01:37:50,371 --> 01:37:53,423
What's happening Harsha..
love between you and Charu?

1010
01:37:53,623 --> 01:37:54,924
That girl is not your type Appa Rao

1011
01:37:55,124 --> 01:37:57,051
You both are one type?
Like typing machine, computer

1012
01:37:57,251 --> 01:38:01,871
See uncle, they are in love and I, like
an idiot am going behind Charu

1013
01:38:02,130 --> 01:38:05,131
How did you ever think
Charu will fall for your face?

1014
01:38:05,132 --> 01:38:08,084
There should be a limit f
or desire. Stupid fellow

1015
01:38:08,759 --> 01:38:14,522
Babu, you read a book and sleep.
I will explain the remaining things

1016
01:38:14,723 --> 01:38:16,909
What are you seeing? Let us go.

1017
01:38:17,109 --> 01:38:21,263
Wash it.
Show, look how it came?

1018
01:38:21,464 --> 01:38:23,226
Did you listen me saying to
have it for some more time?

1019
01:38:23,426 --> 01:38:27,524
If it doesn't turn red, such
fellows would come as husband

1020
01:38:27,742 --> 01:38:31,032
What do you want to do?
She would break both your legs

1021
01:38:31,233 --> 01:38:33,862
Push into the well and would jump
on you to kill, she is too dangerous

1022
01:38:34,061 --> 01:38:35,572
Clean it properly

1023
01:38:35,771 --> 01:38:38,223
Come, hold

1024
01:38:40,649 --> 01:38:46,537
Show! Wow, it has turned deep red...
You will get a fair husband

1025
01:38:46,738 --> 01:38:54,743
I don't like fair people,
I like wheat complexioned

1026
01:38:54,744 --> 01:38:56,820
or dusky looking people but not fair.

1027
01:38:58,162 --> 01:38:59,563
I don't know what went
wrong between you and

1028
01:38:59,564 --> 01:39:01,048
Charu but it is clear that
she doesn't like you.

1029
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:03,008
She is sending such signals secretly.

1030
01:39:03,207 --> 01:39:05,844
Even if Charu is mine, our friendship
should remain intact. I literally beg you.

1031
01:39:06,043 --> 01:39:07,203
Okay..

1032
01:39:10,546 --> 01:39:15,976
In the film, heroine misunderstood
the hero and told him to forget her.

1033
01:39:16,175 --> 01:39:22,630
Later she realised her mistake,
goes crying to the hero and hugs him.

1034
01:39:23,055 --> 01:39:25,940
It is cold, better cover yourself

1035
01:39:26,141 --> 01:39:28,142
If you use the dialogue you saw
in the film on me,

1036
01:39:28,143 --> 01:39:31,303
will break your teeth.
Just shut up and walk

1037
01:39:32,312 --> 01:39:37,867
Smoking and alcohol consumption
is injurious to health

1038
01:39:38,066 --> 01:39:39,601
Come Harsha

1039
01:39:40,152 --> 01:39:42,603
You go, will come in ten minutes.
– Okay

1040
01:39:45,362 --> 01:39:47,749
Smoking and alcohol consumption
is injurious to health

1041
01:39:47,948 --> 01:39:48,625
What is this?

1042
01:39:48,824 --> 01:39:51,401
Liquor, you too want to drink?

1043
01:39:52,577 --> 01:39:54,586
I am cleaning the entire village,
and here you are messing it up.

1044
01:39:54,787 --> 01:39:55,421
Remove all this.

1045
01:39:55,620 --> 01:39:56,821
Remove it?

1046
01:40:01,999 --> 01:40:03,467
This is Sasi's stock!

1047
01:40:03,669 --> 01:40:04,302
Come here

1048
01:40:04,501 --> 01:40:06,554
Smoking and alcohol consumption
is injurious to health

1049
01:40:06,753 --> 01:40:08,930
I did not ask to whom this belongs to..
I asked what this is.

1050
01:40:09,129 --> 01:40:10,641
Don't you want to live in the village?

1051
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:12,349
Smoking and alcohol consumption
is injurious to health

1052
01:40:12,550 --> 01:40:16,253
What am I asking, what are you saying?
How many drinks did you take?

1053
01:40:19,262 --> 01:40:23,133
Don't pick up a fight with Sashi's men.
You will be finished.

1054
01:40:39,695 --> 01:40:42,104
What have you done? You have
picked up a fight with Sashi's men?

1055
01:40:42,363 --> 01:40:45,332
They were doing irritating things on
the road, so I just told them it is wrong.

1056
01:40:45,531 --> 01:40:48,108
That is where the fight triggers

1057
01:40:48,908 --> 01:40:54,362
Twenty five years back there was
a good guy like you named Ravi.

1058
01:40:57,583 --> 01:41:00,952
Who lived in this house
and in this village.

1059
01:41:01,877 --> 01:41:06,455
He always wanted to do
something good for the village.

1060
01:41:06,796 --> 01:41:14,670
Our village was always backward,
in a pathetic state.

1061
01:41:15,386 --> 01:41:20,648
Ravi, my friend went out of the village
for higher studies, got a good job.

1062
01:41:20,849 --> 01:41:23,802
He was moved by
the plight of the village

1063
01:41:25,603 --> 01:41:29,739
You are going around a village
every day, what is your plan?

1064
01:41:29,938 --> 01:41:33,265
If I go elsewhere and work hard,
I will definitely grow.

1065
01:41:33,650 --> 01:41:36,651
Growth means, I want the people
and the village around me to grow.

1066
01:41:36,652 --> 01:41:37,769
That is real development.

1067
01:41:39,195 --> 01:41:42,897
I want to stay here and
do something for the village.

1068
01:41:43,532 --> 01:41:47,377
Since this village is an arid area,

1069
01:41:47,576 --> 01:41:50,254
I felt the people should have
an alternate source of income.

1070
01:41:50,453 --> 01:41:53,840
We decided to put up a milk diary.

1071
01:41:54,039 --> 01:41:54,632
Smoking and alcohol consumption
is injurious to health

1072
01:41:54,831 --> 01:41:57,832
But there is this Venkat Ratnam's
liquor business...

1073
01:41:57,833 --> 01:42:01,553
We thought we should wake up
people from their intoxication

1074
01:42:01,754 --> 01:42:04,755
Because of liquor villagers were
getting into worse situation.

1075
01:42:04,756 --> 01:42:07,516
We tried to explain to
Venkat Ratnam family.

1076
01:42:07,715 --> 01:42:09,751
But they didn't care.

1077
01:42:11,052 --> 01:42:16,054
We thought we should
wake up people from their intoxication

1078
01:42:16,055 --> 01:42:18,007
and motivate them to work hard

1079
01:42:18,932 --> 01:42:23,677
We were enthusiastic about a change
and about getting into a new world.

1080
01:42:24,937 --> 01:42:27,054
He made them give up liquor

1081
01:42:27,273 --> 01:42:29,449
All of them are smiling
and going to work.

1082
01:42:29,649 --> 01:42:31,075
He has become a great man
in people's eyes.

1083
01:42:31,275 --> 01:42:34,436
If this continues he
will become a leader.

1084
01:42:34,985 --> 01:42:38,563
We shall stop all this, Sasi.

1085
01:43:06,592 --> 01:43:12,337
We were looking up with hope and
suddenly darkness engulfed us

1086
01:43:19,936 --> 01:43:21,612
What did you do?

1087
01:43:21,812 --> 01:43:26,741
Earlier we never had comforts
but we lived well and we were living.

1088
01:43:26,941 --> 01:43:34,688
But now everyone have died.

1089
01:43:34,947 --> 01:43:39,083
Please leave us

1090
01:43:39,282 --> 01:43:43,284
Ravi was blamed for the damage
that took place,

1091
01:43:43,285 --> 01:43:46,047
he was labelled irresponsible
by the villagers

1092
01:43:46,246 --> 01:43:57,704
They sent him to jail by filing a case,
citing deaths were due to short circuit.

1093
01:44:01,090 --> 01:44:05,644
Ravi came out of the jail
as a hardened man.

1094
01:44:05,844 --> 01:44:13,758
He couldn't forget what the villagers
did to him and left the place for ever

1095
01:44:15,892 --> 01:44:22,155
Once he left,
the village languished in darkness

1096
01:44:22,356 --> 01:44:29,244
The people got used to the darkness and now
they saw a ray of hope in you. Let that remain,

1097
01:44:29,443 --> 01:44:36,607
Don’t get into a fight with them
lest we lose that hope too.

1098
01:44:36,948 --> 01:44:40,735
The villagers have no more strength
to take on darkness.

1099
01:44:42,077 --> 01:44:44,988
It's very late, sleep.

1100
01:45:09,681 --> 01:45:10,940
Hello!
Hello Mom!

1101
01:45:11,142 --> 01:45:13,443
How are you?
I am doing good.

1102
01:45:13,643 --> 01:45:16,763
Where are you calling from?
Where is dad?

1103
01:45:18,354 --> 01:45:21,306
He is here, want to speak?

1104
01:45:21,815 --> 01:45:23,516
One minute...

1105
01:45:25,027 --> 01:45:27,896
Harsha

1106
01:45:31,072 --> 01:45:31,789
Harsha

1107
01:45:31,989 --> 01:45:33,416
How are you?

1108
01:45:33,615 --> 01:45:35,376
Did I disturb you?

1109
01:45:35,575 --> 01:45:41,238
You called me, you know
how much it means to me.

1110
01:45:42,746 --> 01:45:45,008
How is the holiday?
Are you enjoying yourself?

1111
01:45:45,207 --> 01:45:47,034
Very good.

1112
01:45:48,334 --> 01:45:50,452
Felt it would be better
if you too were here

1113
01:45:52,879 --> 01:45:55,516
Okay..
After you return, we will plan

1114
01:45:55,715 --> 01:45:57,375
When you coming back

1115
01:45:58,383 --> 01:45:59,393
Harsha..

1116
01:45:59,593 --> 01:46:01,169
Harsha..

1117
01:46:02,010 --> 01:46:03,837
Will call you again

1118
01:46:15,063 --> 01:46:17,848
He wants to holiday, with us

1119
01:46:18,272 --> 01:46:22,684
He followed to beat me.
Don't let him live brother

1120
01:46:23,985 --> 01:46:26,986
He's doing something to
the village with his money.

1121
01:46:26,987 --> 01:46:30,899
Whatever he does goes into
our account, didn't you say that?

1122
01:46:31,450 --> 01:46:35,778
Leave him. Give me the dumbbells.

1123
01:46:57,469 --> 01:46:59,420
Outdoor gym is good...

1124
01:47:01,972 --> 01:47:03,631
Dear, one selfie.

1125
01:47:08,308 --> 01:47:09,902
It is good to have fitness awareness.

1126
01:47:10,103 --> 01:47:12,221
Last night you picked up
a fight with my men..

1127
01:47:14,688 --> 01:47:16,639
You probably didn't know
they were my people.

1128
01:47:17,149 --> 01:47:19,184
They informed me that
they are your people

1129
01:47:20,442 --> 01:47:23,443
Missed you last night, if I had caught
you in the same enthusiasm  last night,

1130
01:47:23,444 --> 01:47:25,080
wonder what would have happened

1131
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:29,066
You are lucky that they updated me.

1132
01:47:29,992 --> 01:47:35,254
What if they didn't discuss all this
and if they piled on you?

1133
01:47:35,453 --> 01:47:36,796
Imagine your situation.

1134
01:47:36,997 --> 01:47:38,865
You all should have come together

1135
01:47:39,749 --> 01:47:41,367
Brother phone

1136
01:47:44,293 --> 01:47:45,345
Brother

1137
01:47:45,544 --> 01:47:49,788
Sasi, they stripped me
off the minister's post..

1138
01:47:50,173 --> 01:47:57,419
I tried maximum.
I am coming to the village. We will plan.

1139
01:48:00,305 --> 01:48:01,965
We will meet again

1140
01:48:04,892 --> 01:48:07,886
You are fortunate,
the call came on time...

1141
01:48:10,103 --> 01:48:12,013
Lucky boys.

1142
01:48:12,834 --> 01:48:14,443
We need to meet
the Collector tomorrow

1143
01:48:14,643 --> 01:48:16,597
She too is getting good matches
brother in law.

1144
01:48:16,797 --> 01:48:19,272
But it is not good to get her married
before Charu, right?

1145
01:48:19,471 --> 01:48:21,064
Look matches faster for her.

1146
01:48:21,264 --> 01:48:22,753
Here dear.
- No thanks

1147
01:48:23,714 --> 01:48:29,087
Me, for me… Ok!

1148
01:48:29,771 --> 01:48:32,545
I informed a few to
look for matches.

1149
01:48:33,126 --> 01:48:36,479
But she looks not to go out of
this village like us

1150
01:48:36,679 --> 01:48:39,233
She would be in problems if
strangers come as in laws

1151
01:48:39,432 --> 01:48:41,303
Then, why don’t you get her
married to known?

1152
01:48:41,780 --> 01:48:43,667
Even Apparao likes
your daughter very much.

1153
01:48:43,868 --> 01:48:45,555
Added, he knows well about her.

1154
01:48:45,855 --> 01:48:49,317
What Apparao,
you haven’t said me about that?

1155
01:48:49,737 --> 01:48:52,543
Charu, come here once baby.

1156
01:48:55,125 --> 01:49:00,244
While searching matches for you,
came to know that Apparao likes you.

1157
01:49:01,836 --> 01:49:06,765
He knows you well from childhood.
He is also settled well. What do you say?

1158
01:49:06,964 --> 01:49:08,274
Shameless fool!

1159
01:49:11,450 --> 01:49:16,092
Can you not understand? Thinking you’d die
crying saying on face, I maintained distance.

1160
01:49:16,292 --> 01:49:18,018
Thought you’d at least understand so.

1161
01:49:18,623 --> 01:49:22,114
All wouldn’t be sharp like you.
We take time to understand.

1162
01:49:22,314 --> 01:49:25,639
I will take him and explain.
You go and look after your work.

1163
01:49:25,860 --> 01:49:31,915
If you mess again with me or bring my topic,
will break your legs and burn bloody.

1164
01:49:33,786 --> 01:49:36,713
As you said so confidently,
thought even that girl likes you.

1165
01:49:37,029 --> 01:49:38,201
Sorry Apparao.

1166
01:49:39,366 --> 01:49:41,547
It seems she would burn your legs,
move on.

1167
01:50:06,137 --> 01:50:12,140
Central Govt is announcing
a coastal corridor project here

1168
01:50:12,141 --> 01:50:14,860
and that will turn this place to gold.

1169
01:50:15,062 --> 01:50:17,738
They will announce it in 2-3 months.

1170
01:50:17,939 --> 01:50:22,658
By being in the government
the entire project plan has been leaked.

1171
01:50:22,858 --> 01:50:29,896
By the time the announcement comes,
we must grab as much as land as we can

1172
01:50:31,114 --> 01:50:34,291
We must pool at least
five to six thousand acres.

1173
01:50:34,492 --> 01:50:38,419
Throw pennies to the farmers.
If they say no, take it by force.

1174
01:50:38,620 --> 01:50:45,199
If it is a problem still, kill them
but all the land should be ours.

1175
01:50:48,418 --> 01:50:50,078
Brother...

1176
01:50:51,920 --> 01:50:53,972
The boy has come from the city

1177
01:50:54,172 --> 01:50:57,249
He wants to take me and
his mother along with him.

1178
01:50:58,175 --> 01:51:01,669
She too wants to go,
created a noise last night.

1179
01:51:02,221 --> 01:51:06,940
Find it difficult to leave you all suddenly.

1180
01:51:07,140 --> 01:51:09,592
Why don't you at least explain to her?

1181
01:51:10,559 --> 01:51:14,529
You are my brother,
I can tell you anything.

1182
01:51:14,730 --> 01:51:17,157
How can I tell your wife?

1183
01:51:17,357 --> 01:51:19,807
Also the children are adults now.

1184
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:23,452
By wanting to stay together,
aren't we denying their desires.

1185
01:51:23,652 --> 01:51:25,353
It is selfishness.

1186
01:51:26,905 --> 01:51:29,732
All these years we lived together..

1187
01:51:31,699 --> 01:51:32,959
How far are you going?

1188
01:51:33,159 --> 01:51:36,695
Just Hyderabad right?
We will meet during festivals

1189
01:51:48,004 --> 01:51:49,887
Mother pack these half sarees

1190
01:51:50,087 --> 01:51:52,789
Why take it,
when you are going to the city?

1191
01:51:53,215 --> 01:51:55,250
Where did I keep that?

1192
01:51:57,886 --> 01:52:02,088
Instead of sitting idle,
why don't you help him pack bags?

1193
01:52:04,015 --> 01:52:05,608
Mother why did you pack that mattress?

1194
01:52:05,808 --> 01:52:08,401
I thought it will be useful if
someone comes home to sleep

1195
01:52:08,601 --> 01:52:10,277
I told you that we already have it there

1196
01:52:10,477 --> 01:52:14,155
He told us to pack only clothes,
rest has already been bought

1197
01:52:14,355 --> 01:52:18,357
After going there, if I find
something missing I will call you.

1198
01:52:18,358 --> 01:52:19,643
You send it with someone

1199
01:52:20,443 --> 01:52:24,037
Think once more Jyothi.
What will do there?

1200
01:52:24,237 --> 01:52:25,997
What will do there?

1201
01:52:26,198 --> 01:52:27,248
What are we doing here?

1202
01:52:27,448 --> 01:52:29,025
You all will stay together.

1203
01:52:37,331 --> 01:52:39,532
Will live together in there village
with whole family

1204
01:52:41,249 --> 01:52:44,251
It is just an excitement that
you are going to a new place,

1205
01:52:44,252 --> 01:52:46,412
but even you don't know
why you are leaving.

1206
01:52:48,423 --> 01:52:51,583
There is nothing new for you at
this age to see and do there.

1207
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:54,800
You will see four big buildings
from your house,

1208
01:52:54,802 --> 01:52:56,837
there will be four extra hours
of power supply

1209
01:52:57,095 --> 01:53:01,214
But you will not find people who will
speak four affectionate words to you.

1210
01:53:06,561 --> 01:53:10,387
Your sarcasm might
not hurt anyone here

1211
01:53:11,230 --> 01:53:13,031
In fact it is fun.

1212
01:53:13,232 --> 01:53:19,394
But you will miss that conversation
and innuendos.

1213
01:53:23,114 --> 01:53:28,501
Going doesn't mean packing bags
and climbing down four stairs,

1214
01:53:28,702 --> 01:53:33,738
when you actually want to return you
will have to alight thousands of steps.

1215
01:53:38,166 --> 01:53:41,167
Every time he hears someone is going,
he runs to the bus stop

1216
01:53:41,168 --> 01:53:43,386
and pleads people
not to leave the village

1217
01:53:43,588 --> 01:53:48,540
Now when his own brother is going,
how will he face the village and live?

1218
01:54:00,850 --> 01:54:05,636
It is nice that you have settled down
and want to take your parents with you

1219
01:54:06,186 --> 01:54:08,186
But you are separating them
from their brother and sister-in-law

1220
01:54:08,187 --> 01:54:09,889
who are like their parents.

1221
01:54:14,151 --> 01:54:18,395
You can visit them on weekends
if they stay here

1222
01:54:19,363 --> 01:54:22,107
If you get into a Volvo bus in the night,
next morning you are here

1223
01:54:22,407 --> 01:54:26,409
But if they go with you, the distance
will be as big as the Sankranti festival

1224
01:54:26,410 --> 01:54:28,361
that you can't visit even once a year.

1225
01:54:30,579 --> 01:54:34,506
The brothers have lived together
for 40 years.

1226
01:54:34,707 --> 01:54:36,408
It is really something

1227
01:54:36,792 --> 01:54:43,038
We should keep seeing that boss.
It will be nice.

1228
01:54:52,387 --> 01:54:55,256
Don't misunderstand me because
I interfered in your family matter.

1229
01:54:55,597 --> 01:54:57,757
The few days I stayed here
I ate at your place.

1230
01:54:59,142 --> 01:55:01,136
It feels nice when you all are happy.

1231
01:55:10,608 --> 01:55:13,619
Come home three days before
the big festival.	- Okay mother

1232
01:55:13,819 --> 01:55:17,147
We all will celebrate here
Will come definitely

1233
01:55:28,289 --> 01:55:31,132
Don't get worried. I will check.
I know uncle, you are a gem

1234
01:55:31,332 --> 01:55:33,158
Okay...

1235
01:55:33,417 --> 01:55:36,345
I am going to Sumati's garden,
anyone escorting me?

1236
01:55:36,545 --> 01:55:38,971
Not you, look this side.
The matter is, I am talking to you

1237
01:55:39,172 --> 01:55:43,082
Going to Sumati's garden.
Anyone coming along with me?

1238
01:56:02,806 --> 01:56:07,384
Babu till you go, she will keep going
to the garden. Go with her

1239
01:56:14,814 --> 01:56:16,156
Sumati sister, are you fine?

1240
01:56:16,356 --> 01:56:17,448
Fine..
How are you Charu?

1241
01:56:17,648 --> 01:56:18,116
Fine..

1242
01:56:18,317 --> 01:56:19,075
Is the course over?

1243
01:56:19,275 --> 01:56:19,783
Yes done

1244
01:56:19,983 --> 01:56:20,576
Namaste Babu

1245
01:56:20,776 --> 01:56:21,327
Namaste

1246
01:56:21,526 --> 01:56:25,287
I have learnt to grow vegetables
in a new technique, let us try.

1247
01:56:25,487 --> 01:56:29,489
I want henna leaves Sister,
it should turn deep red,

1248
01:56:29,490 --> 01:56:32,234
a colour that would bring
me a fair husband.

1249
01:56:33,078 --> 01:56:39,081
Pluck all the leaves Charu. Anyway
we are removing all the plants,

1250
01:56:39,082 --> 01:56:40,533
we are leaving the village tomorrow.

1251
01:56:42,291 --> 01:56:45,036
Why sister, so suddenly?

1252
01:56:45,919 --> 01:56:50,014
Minister came to village yesterday.
He wants this entire field,

1253
01:56:50,215 --> 01:56:55,502
We begged him,
but he beat my father in law.

1254
01:56:57,720 --> 01:57:02,232
Tomorrow they will give us compensation
and will get us to sign the papers.

1255
01:57:02,431 --> 01:57:06,884
That is why I am planning to go to
the city to look out for some work.

1256
01:57:08,685 --> 01:57:11,096
Take whatever you want.

1257
01:57:45,212 --> 01:57:47,288
Will leave if you sign the papers fast

1258
01:57:50,424 --> 01:57:55,602
Her dead husband must be
known to you.

1259
01:57:55,803 --> 01:57:59,464
He left his village to the borders,
and died for us in the war.

1260
01:57:59,890 --> 01:58:02,759
We can't do anything but
empathise with them.

1261
01:58:03,393 --> 01:58:05,393
Even then without asking for help,
with the money she had,

1262
01:58:05,394 --> 01:58:07,112
she purchased a field and is growing
vegetables to feed her family.

1263
01:58:07,311 --> 01:58:10,072
Some fellow takes a fetish for the field,
and you arrive with papers....

1264
01:58:10,273 --> 01:58:11,240
Leave

1265
01:58:11,439 --> 01:58:13,557
If you sign fast we will leave

1266
01:58:14,941 --> 01:58:16,893
Take the kids inside

1267
01:58:19,945 --> 01:58:23,231
I am a new person here and my throat is
choked listening to their story.

1268
01:58:23,740 --> 01:58:27,652
You people have been here for years...
don't you sympathise a bit with them?

1269
01:58:35,416 --> 01:58:36,925
I will stay here,

1270
01:58:37,124 --> 01:58:42,386
the field will be there, but I am
doubtful if he is alive or not.

1271
01:58:42,586 --> 01:58:44,222
He is just not moving.

1272
01:58:44,423 --> 01:58:46,499
First take him somewhere and
get him treated.

1273
01:58:54,430 --> 01:58:55,731
Who

1274
01:58:55,931 --> 01:58:58,858
Who in this village has
the guts to hit our men?

1275
01:58:59,058 --> 01:59:04,595
One man came to this village
and adopted it.

1276
01:59:06,228 --> 01:59:09,015
The changes you see is due to him.

1277
01:59:10,442 --> 01:59:12,893
I thought he is wealthy and crazy

1278
01:59:14,735 --> 01:59:16,786
But never thought he is
strong enough to fight us

1279
01:59:16,986 --> 01:59:18,705
Have you gone mad?

1280
01:59:18,905 --> 01:59:22,907
A new person settles down in the village
and does all  these things,

1281
01:59:22,908 --> 01:59:24,359
you people watch silently?

1282
01:59:25,743 --> 01:59:29,279
Where does he stay? Bring him
to the mango orchard immediately

1283
01:59:30,331 --> 01:59:32,407
Will have to tackle him.

1284
01:59:37,616 --> 01:59:42,865
Harsha! Sasi had come for you.

1285
01:59:43,067 --> 01:59:45,886
He asked you to come to their
mango orchid as soon as you come.

1286
01:59:46,086 --> 01:59:48,598
He is also taken Charu saying to
send her back only when you come.

1287
01:59:48,896 --> 01:59:49,926
Leave about her.

1288
01:59:50,563 --> 01:59:56,636
If we go and plead at their feet
they would leave Charu.

1289
01:59:57,622 --> 02:00:01,103
But, it is very dangerous
for you to go there.

1290
02:00:01,537 --> 02:00:04,457
Please pack your luggage and
leave from this village.

1291
02:01:07,417 --> 02:01:08,719
He...

1292
02:01:08,918 --> 02:01:10,537
He is the one

1293
02:01:31,018 --> 02:01:34,153
The world is very small.
We all met at one place.

1294
02:01:34,354 --> 02:01:35,972
How are you?

1295
02:01:36,647 --> 02:01:40,934
To talk to me, why take her with you?
One word and I would be here.

1296
02:01:41,609 --> 02:01:43,661
You leave Charu,
I will speak for a while and come.

1297
02:01:43,861 --> 02:01:45,145
Let her be here,

1298
02:01:45,487 --> 02:01:50,399
She needs to see what all happens here
and narrate it in the village

1299
02:01:50,823 --> 02:01:53,650
Then wait Charu...
we will leave together

1300
02:01:54,243 --> 02:01:59,172
To come, speak and go,
do you think this is Delhi?

1301
02:01:59,372 --> 02:02:03,467
Devarakota!
Mango orchard in Devarakota.

1302
02:02:03,666 --> 02:02:06,385
There is only coming here,
no going out.

1303
02:02:06,584 --> 02:02:07,345
That is what....

1304
02:02:07,544 --> 02:02:11,139
You have adopted the village and
you are spending money.

1305
02:02:11,338 --> 02:02:15,226
You are following your passion,
but why meddle with us?

1306
02:02:15,425 --> 02:02:19,427
Do you think adoption is about
pulling out cash from the pocket,

1307
02:02:19,428 --> 02:02:20,713
colouring and laying roads and leaving?

1308
02:02:22,889 --> 02:02:26,842
I have adopted the goodness
and also the negativity in the village.

1309
02:02:29,851 --> 02:02:33,054
This fellow, that one, that one,

1310
02:02:33,688 --> 02:02:35,473
all these people,

1311
02:02:36,315 --> 02:02:37,932
you,

1312
02:02:39,151 --> 02:02:40,827
your brother...

1313
02:02:41,027 --> 02:02:43,146
I adopted everyone.

1314
02:02:44,571 --> 02:02:48,649
So you won't let us grab the fields?

1315
02:02:49,283 --> 02:02:52,611
I came here to discuss about
what you grabbed till now

1316
02:02:55,204 --> 02:02:58,031
I have noted it down
lest I might forget it.

1317
02:02:59,666 --> 02:03:02,676
You have swallowed the funds allotted
for the repair of 43 ZP High Schools.

1318
02:03:02,875 --> 02:03:04,827
You have to return

1319
02:03:05,877 --> 02:03:08,639
You have grabbed the funds
sanctioned for 72 ZP roads.

1320
02:03:08,839 --> 02:03:10,307
Return it.

1321
02:03:10,506 --> 02:03:13,600
350 crores meant for drought
has been swallowed.

1322
02:03:13,801 --> 02:03:15,335
Return it.

1323
02:03:15,593 --> 02:03:20,023
Way back you killed 30 in the dairy
and 23 more who confronted you.

1324
02:03:20,222 --> 02:03:22,089
Will a human being ever do that?

1325
02:03:24,309 --> 02:03:26,760
You will have to take care
of their families.

1326
02:03:28,143 --> 02:03:31,531
You gulped the lake water meant
to irrigate fields in 11 villages.

1327
02:03:31,730 --> 02:03:33,515
What is this gulping down a lake?

1328
02:03:36,024 --> 02:03:38,476
You will have to return everything.

1329
02:03:39,986 --> 02:03:41,853
What if I don't give?

1330
02:03:45,406 --> 02:03:47,232
Planning to kill all of you

1331
02:05:44,827 --> 02:05:47,945
Because it is Delhi I spoke
a little and returned.

1332
02:05:48,204 --> 02:05:50,007
This is Devarakota,

1333
02:05:50,206 --> 02:05:52,657
a remote mango orchard.

1334
02:05:52,999 --> 02:05:56,076
If I kill you there will be
none to ask or enquire.

1335
02:05:58,170 --> 02:05:59,705
Come Charu

1336
02:06:04,216 --> 02:06:06,434
You have taken a lot
from the village.

1337
02:06:06,634 --> 02:06:10,629
Return it otherwise
you will turn obese.

1338
02:06:12,253 --> 02:06:25,476
The one whose beatings would make
the mind get blocked is my husband

1339
02:06:43,963 --> 02:06:48,235
I got scent going to Dubai
I got powder going to Japan

1340
02:06:48,493 --> 02:06:52,956
Roamed whole Malaysia and
plucked Jasmines for you

1341
02:06:53,160 --> 02:06:57,337
I got the China silk dhoti
I got the Singapore watch

1342
02:06:57,539 --> 02:07:02,063
I got colourful goggles
going to Rangoon

1343
02:07:02,262 --> 02:07:10,840
I got the rings, wear them
Catch then, I gave my hand to you

1344
02:07:11,122 --> 02:07:15,874
Makeup seems cute and new

1345
02:07:16,075 --> 02:07:20,156
Hey dear, seeing you
my mind is blocked completely

1346
02:07:24,754 --> 02:07:29,248
Hey mind is blocked and
is very great feeling

1347
02:07:34,197 --> 02:07:38,435
I got scent going to Dubai
I got powder going to Japan

1348
02:07:38,708 --> 02:07:43,336
Roamed whole Malaysia and
plucked Jasmines for you

1349
02:07:43,537 --> 02:07:47,666
I got the China silk dhoti
I got the Singapore watch

1350
02:07:47,866 --> 02:07:52,337
I got colourful goggles
going to Rangoon

1351
02:07:52,946 --> 02:08:01,534
Hey beautiful parrot and
my sweet dish, you are colourful

1352
02:08:15,774 --> 02:08:19,717
Hey baby, will become the soap in
your bath and blink becoming the door

1353
02:08:20,120 --> 02:08:24,125
I will turn into towel
and fulfil my dream

1354
02:08:24,575 --> 02:08:28,929
I will become the dollar on
your chest and fish curry for you

1355
02:08:29,257 --> 02:08:33,372
I will write your name and
fly my saree into the air

1356
02:08:33,572 --> 02:08:38,070
If you become the sweet,
I will be born as a small ant

1357
02:08:38,326 --> 02:08:42,607
If you rush like honey bee, I will be
born as a new flower every day

1358
02:08:42,912 --> 02:08:47,034
Hey dear, seeing you
my mind is blocked completely

1359
02:08:51,415 --> 02:08:56,249
Hey mind is blocked and
is very great feeling

1360
02:09:25,628 --> 02:09:29,677
Seeing you, even the water I drink
is given kick like the toddy

1361
02:09:29,943 --> 02:09:33,907
There is some sedative in your colour

1362
02:09:34,212 --> 02:09:38,651
Air from your side
is making me go crazy

1363
02:09:38,884 --> 02:09:43,053
You hid the valuable weed
in your hot looks

1364
02:09:43,401 --> 02:09:47,898
When would you be mine?

1365
02:09:48,131 --> 02:09:52,372
Make me yours now
in your tight hug

1366
02:09:52,630 --> 02:09:56,768
Hey dear, seeing you
my mind is blocked completely

1367
02:10:01,342 --> 02:10:05,999
Hey mind is blocked and
is very great feeling

1368
02:10:20,152 --> 02:10:23,205
I did a blunder by stopping
you from killing him.

1369
02:10:23,404 --> 02:10:26,539
He came right to Delhi
to warn me about you.

1370
02:10:26,740 --> 02:10:29,734
I did a mistake
by not leaving him to you.

1371
02:10:30,284 --> 02:10:32,753
Now he is here,

1372
02:10:32,952 --> 02:10:34,670
yet we couldn't do anything

1373
02:10:34,871 --> 02:10:39,424
Chop him into pieces.

1374
02:10:39,625 --> 02:10:46,580
I found him earlier when I was
dealing with two RTA officials.

1375
02:10:47,587 --> 02:10:50,289
He hit me, saved them and left.

1376
02:10:51,508 --> 02:10:55,378
In one way he is the reason for
you losing the minister's post.

1377
02:10:55,636 --> 02:10:58,546
He is Ravikant's son who owns
properties in thousand crores.

1378
02:11:02,307 --> 02:11:03,525
Ravikant's son?

1379
02:11:03,724 --> 02:11:06,402
Getting scared of him day by day.

1380
02:11:06,601 --> 02:11:10,603
Every evening he goes to the lake.
Heard he will stop the lake water

1381
02:11:10,604 --> 02:11:12,681
going to the factory and
divert it to the fields.

1382
02:11:16,233 --> 02:11:17,826
Hello!
How are you Ravi?

1383
02:11:18,027 --> 02:11:21,772
Who?
Venkatratnam

1384
02:11:22,697 --> 02:11:26,000
You left the village and
have become a big man.

1385
02:11:26,199 --> 02:11:29,628
I am happy in a way that you are
in the position because of us.

1386
02:11:29,827 --> 02:11:34,882
After earning so much, why did you
send your son here to the village?

1387
02:11:35,081 --> 02:11:41,136
We thought you were dangerous,
your son is far more dangerous.

1388
02:11:41,335 --> 02:11:43,263
It was enough to evict you
from the village

1389
02:11:43,462 --> 02:11:46,097
but we need to send your son
straight out of this world.

1390
02:11:46,298 --> 02:11:47,649
Come and take his body

1391
02:11:47,848 --> 02:11:49,807
Smoking and alcohol consumption
is injurious to health

1392
02:11:50,008 --> 02:11:53,460
Venkat Ratnam...
Venkat Ratnam...

1393
02:16:25,832 --> 02:16:27,218
Check the situation properly
Okay sir

1394
02:16:27,418 --> 02:16:29,661
Doctor
Yes

1395
02:16:30,796 --> 02:16:35,807
He has to live doctor,
he is my life.. Please doctor

1396
02:16:36,007 --> 02:16:38,375
We are doing our best..
Don’t worry

1397
02:16:44,763 --> 02:16:47,216
I can't live without him mother,

1398
02:16:48,391 --> 02:16:50,593
I want him...mom

1399
02:16:52,226 --> 02:16:53,971
What Charu?

1400
02:16:54,728 --> 02:16:57,181
You already know him?

1401
02:16:58,856 --> 02:17:02,227
Yes, in Hyderabad.

1402
02:17:04,360 --> 02:17:07,188
We love each other.

1403
02:17:09,199 --> 02:17:13,201
But when I got to know that
he is son of Ravikant,

1404
02:17:13,202 --> 02:17:15,569
who left our village,
I kept him at a distance.

1405
02:17:18,871 --> 02:17:21,657
He came here without my knowledge,

1406
02:17:23,084 --> 02:17:27,387
I thought he came for me
and still kept him away

1407
02:17:27,587 --> 02:17:31,206
But he loves the village more than me.

1408
02:17:32,756 --> 02:17:39,545
He is a nice person father,
more than you, me and the village.

1409
02:18:21,208 --> 02:18:22,660
Excuse me,

1410
02:18:25,129 --> 02:18:27,038
I am Dr Ganesh.

1411
02:18:27,631 --> 02:18:29,182
There has been stabbing in two places.

1412
02:18:29,382 --> 02:18:31,166
Lot of blood has been lost.

1413
02:18:31,884 --> 02:18:34,544
We have done a surgery,
now he is alright.

1414
02:18:36,137 --> 02:18:40,139
He's been here and
built the hospital very well.

1415
02:18:40,140 --> 02:18:42,299
I felt very happy for
what he was doing.

1416
02:18:42,557 --> 02:18:45,260
but I never thought
I had to treat him here.

1417
02:18:46,394 --> 02:18:47,929
Sorry sir.

1418
02:19:03,532 --> 02:19:05,108
Even if this village changes,

1419
02:19:05,408 --> 02:19:07,318
You people won't change..

1420
02:19:08,160 --> 02:19:09,902
You will continue to live.

1421
02:19:10,577 --> 02:19:12,404
Live..

1422
02:19:14,330 --> 02:19:16,074
One son,

1423
02:19:16,831 --> 02:19:18,826
My only son.

1424
02:19:20,709 --> 02:19:23,037
Let him live.

1425
02:19:24,297 --> 02:19:26,514
What is there in this village?

1426
02:19:26,714 --> 02:19:28,640
Our land, Our village..

1427
02:19:28,840 --> 02:19:31,126
You continue to live.

1428
02:19:31,967 --> 02:19:34,128
Live..

1429
02:19:34,930 --> 02:19:38,507
Are you able to eat twice a day?

1430
02:19:40,223 --> 02:19:42,676
Are you scared what will happen
to you if he goes?

1431
02:19:43,936 --> 02:19:47,113
As long as you all live,

1432
02:19:47,313 --> 02:19:48,740
I will take care of you.

1433
02:19:48,940 --> 02:19:50,307
All of you.

1434
02:19:51,567 --> 02:19:55,352
If something happens to my son...
each one...

1435
02:20:02,615 --> 02:20:05,985
Send my son to me..

1436
02:20:09,537 --> 02:20:12,906
Send my son to me..

1437
02:20:13,122 --> 02:20:14,824
Please..

1438
02:20:22,379 --> 02:20:26,916
Heard he came to the village
because of you,  he likes you a lot.

1439
02:20:27,468 --> 02:20:30,469
If it is possible leave the village
and come with us,

1440
02:20:30,470 --> 02:20:33,172
there will not be any relation
between him and the village.

1441
02:20:45,606 --> 02:20:47,448
Nothing happened to me mother.

1442
02:20:47,647 --> 02:20:49,099
Small injury, that's all.

1443
02:20:50,024 --> 02:20:54,270
Five people were killed and
I couldn't save them.

1444
02:21:00,782 --> 02:21:03,294
Can I go doctor,
there is lot of work.

1445
02:21:03,494 --> 02:21:06,404
No dear. It is enough.

1446
02:21:07,537 --> 02:21:09,989
Please go from here.

1447
02:21:10,999 --> 02:21:15,660
We might not have lived well
before you came but were alive

1448
02:21:17,043 --> 02:21:21,307
But after this we are doubtful
if we will live.

1449
02:21:21,507 --> 02:21:23,958
Please leave immediately.

1450
02:21:24,966 --> 02:21:32,004
Please leave Harsha, let us and
the village live like this...please

1451
02:21:48,776 --> 02:21:54,747
Why doesn’t this world let you
be yourself, to flow freely,

1452
02:21:54,946 --> 02:22:00,710
But wants to stir up
a volcano in your soul.

1453
02:22:00,910 --> 02:22:06,797
There are stumbling blocks, even
for you spreading sunshine,

1454
02:22:06,997 --> 02:22:12,719
but it’s not in your hands which turn
your fate takes to reach your destiny.

1455
02:22:12,919 --> 02:22:20,666
Can you live, even be without feeling
the breeze of your dreamland.

1456
02:22:21,882 --> 02:22:28,879
Can you console your heart for not
moving in the direction of your dreams.

1457
02:22:30,972 --> 02:22:36,819
Go forth, oh wealthy man,
get going, oh wealthy man.

1458
02:22:37,018 --> 02:22:40,304
Fly like a free bird....

1459
02:22:43,023 --> 02:22:48,785
Go forth, oh wealthy man,
get going, oh wealthy man.

1460
02:22:48,985 --> 02:22:56,734
Dedicated to your mission and service...
go....

1461
02:23:04,121 --> 02:23:07,008
It’s because of your crying only
all this problem in this village

1462
02:23:07,208 --> 02:23:12,245
first if you hand over your land and
leave this village,  all will go smoothly

1463
02:23:12,587 --> 02:23:15,414
Our livelihood is only on that land

1464
02:23:16,005 --> 02:23:17,540
Brother..

1465
02:23:27,013 --> 02:23:28,715
Sign it

1466
02:23:51,948 --> 02:23:53,816
Brother-in-law

1467
02:24:29,313 --> 02:24:31,222
Why is the bus not coming still?

1468
02:24:32,397 --> 02:24:38,769
My heart will break if he counts …
that another family is leaving the village

1469
02:24:45,156 --> 02:24:52,237
If anyone leaves the village …
Do you know why I counted loudly?

1470
02:24:52,494 --> 02:24:58,825
It is small hope that you will
stop them leaving the village

1471
02:25:01,461 --> 02:25:08,082
If you only leave the village …
Who will be there for us and village?

1472
02:25:14,510 --> 02:25:16,812
Think once again Narayana..

1473
02:25:17,012 --> 02:25:19,465
You are like the head of this village

1474
02:25:20,014 --> 02:25:23,735
If you also leave the village,
what will happen to this village?

1475
02:25:23,934 --> 02:25:27,012
What will happen to this village..?

1476
02:25:27,895 --> 02:25:34,809
The one whom you pray daily has not
saved this village and the people here

1477
02:25:36,111 --> 02:25:42,274
If god doesn’t like us to be with
this village and its soil……

1478
02:25:48,847 --> 02:25:50,089
Harsha

1479
02:26:00,795 --> 02:26:04,166
I thought you will take some time to
become okay and be normal with us...

1480
02:26:05,341 --> 02:26:07,793
But you are distancing yourself
from us every day

1481
02:26:09,093 --> 02:26:10,352
Won't you change?

1482
02:26:10,552 --> 02:26:12,130
I want to change,

1483
02:26:13,722 --> 02:26:16,066
but change more and more like me

1484
02:26:16,267 --> 02:26:18,901
My effort was to keep you away
from the village,

1485
02:26:19,101 --> 02:26:22,071
Got you here. What more?

1486
02:26:22,271 --> 02:26:24,614
You brought me out of the village

1487
02:26:24,813 --> 02:26:27,266
But you are not able to take
the village out of me

1488
02:26:27,815 --> 02:26:29,434
What is there in the village?

1489
02:26:30,027 --> 02:26:32,995
Your mother, father, home and
family is here. Everything is here.

1490
02:26:33,194 --> 02:26:35,188
But my life is there

1491
02:26:37,282 --> 02:26:42,611
I am moving around in suit and boot like
corpse in this house but I am not here.

1492
02:26:44,244 --> 02:26:46,697
I never felt this is only my family.

1493
02:26:47,204 --> 02:26:50,240
I feel that every person in a problem
is my family.

1494
02:26:52,250 --> 02:26:53,909
Sorry to say this...

1495
02:26:56,127 --> 02:26:58,128
25 years back you told them
that development is not

1496
02:26:58,129 --> 02:27:00,498
growing individually, it means
even the people around you.

1497
02:27:00,964 --> 02:27:05,626
Sounds great, wonder how great
it will be if we implement it.

1498
02:27:09,796 --> 02:27:12,791
We will hurt ourselves while doing
something to achieve our goal

1499
02:27:13,298 --> 02:27:16,043
But even while staying in the house
we might get hurt

1500
02:27:17,636 --> 02:27:21,230
Just because the villagers spoke harshly
once you left them and came here..

1501
02:27:21,429 --> 02:27:25,050
But they are very proud that their
Ravi has become a great man.

1502
02:27:25,724 --> 02:27:27,633
They are also our family.

1503
02:27:29,645 --> 02:27:33,389
You worked with a vengeance and
earned so much wealth...

1504
02:27:33,605 --> 02:27:36,606
Put your hand on your heart and
tell me how many times

1505
02:27:36,607 --> 02:27:38,391
you might have thought about
the village and villagers.

1506
02:27:43,905 --> 02:27:46,357
You made 25 thousand crores,

1507
02:27:46,989 --> 02:27:49,442
I need to double that.

1508
02:27:50,325 --> 02:27:52,086
I can't do that..

1509
02:27:52,286 --> 02:27:55,530
Moreover I feel like distributing five
or ten out of what you've given me.

1510
02:27:57,122 --> 02:27:59,115
I go and sit in the office,

1511
02:27:59,874 --> 02:28:03,034
I find a farmer looking hopelessly at a
lake that will never be of help to his field.

1512
02:28:04,252 --> 02:28:06,705
When I sit down to eat,

1513
02:28:07,004 --> 02:28:10,248
I see people with hunger
migrating to the cities.

1514
02:28:11,632 --> 02:28:13,501
I am not able to do it.

1515
02:28:17,304 --> 02:28:20,257
If I stay here I will be suffering
and you will also suffer seeing me

1516
02:28:20,722 --> 02:28:23,925
If I go there I will be happy,
I can keep ten people happy.

1517
02:28:24,850 --> 02:28:26,635
I agree you have given me birth

1518
02:28:27,312 --> 02:28:30,472
But I can't stay right in front of you
as long as I live to keep you happy.

1519
02:28:32,691 --> 02:28:34,517
I am not a good son,

1520
02:28:36,944 --> 02:28:39,562
If possible will come and visit for
a festival or some celebration.

1521
02:28:40,321 --> 02:28:42,773
As a son I can't do anything more.

1522
02:28:43,238 --> 02:28:45,358
Just leave me once for this life.

1523
02:28:55,489 --> 02:28:58,358
Everyone says I have a handsome son

1524
02:28:59,992 --> 02:29:02,111
But I think I have a good son.

1525
02:29:03,202 --> 02:29:04,279
Go....

1526
02:29:04,621 --> 02:29:07,239
Wherever you want,
whichever place you like.

1527
02:29:07,791 --> 02:29:10,075
Make everyone happy
and be happy.

1528
02:29:23,968 --> 02:29:27,046
Many lives are waiting
for you over there

1529
02:29:27,930 --> 02:29:29,590
Don't be late Harsha

1530
02:29:30,807 --> 02:29:31,924
Go

1531
02:29:42,523 --> 02:29:45,767
These are tears of happiness,

1532
02:29:46,984 --> 02:29:52,939
Thanks for being my son

1533
02:30:01,079 --> 02:30:02,797
It is all yours,

1534
02:30:02,996 --> 02:30:05,156
Business and family too

1535
02:30:05,708 --> 02:30:07,867
You should take care of
my parents too

1536
02:30:34,715 --> 02:30:37,168
Everything is over Babu

1537
02:30:39,386 --> 02:30:43,839
We have six thousand acres
for the next coastal area.

1538
02:30:44,430 --> 02:30:46,274
Can there be something
more valuable than this?

1539
02:30:46,473 --> 02:30:48,150
Yeah

1540
02:30:48,350 --> 02:30:50,777
To my knowledge
this is the biggest project

1541
02:30:50,977 --> 02:30:52,321
Land is ours,
project is yours,

1542
02:30:52,521 --> 02:30:54,030
Profit should be 50-50?

1543
02:30:54,229 --> 02:30:57,406
Yeah, sure.
I can't imagine bigger deal than this..

1544
02:30:57,606 --> 02:31:00,158
But all these are fields belonging to the
villagers, won't there be a problem?

1545
02:31:00,358 --> 02:31:03,143
If it is taken by pleading
there may be some problem

1546
02:31:04,029 --> 02:31:06,939
We killed and grabbed the land

1547
02:31:07,864 --> 02:31:10,023
No one will come this side..

1548
02:31:31,256 --> 02:31:34,250
You have already started
a business with fields?

1549
02:31:36,134 --> 02:31:38,212
They aren't papers

1550
02:31:38,429 --> 02:31:39,880
They are lives.

1551
02:31:40,806 --> 02:31:44,008
I thought you will be smartly dressed
and drinking in an AC room

1552
02:31:44,348 --> 02:31:47,444
But will it be good if you die
a dog's death in a liquor factory?

1553
02:31:47,643 --> 02:31:49,652
What is this nonsense Venkat Ratnam?
I will meet again.

1554
02:31:49,852 --> 02:31:51,387
No chance,

1555
02:31:52,354 --> 02:31:54,807
there won't be anyone left
amongst these to meet you

1556
02:31:57,483 --> 02:31:59,227
Bad luck.

1557
02:31:59,776 --> 02:32:03,105
There is not one fellow
who didn’t pierce me near the lake.

1558
02:32:04,323 --> 02:32:06,565
I didn’t get angry for that also

1559
02:32:07,575 --> 02:32:12,194
I left my family and came here
assuming that this village is my life..

1560
02:32:12,869 --> 02:32:14,988
But you saw to it that
the village disappeared

1561
02:32:16,081 --> 02:32:20,450
Put your hand on your heart and
tell me are you worth living?

1562
02:32:21,335 --> 02:32:23,953
I can beat you and take the papers

1563
02:32:24,795 --> 02:32:26,454
You will come again

1564
02:32:26,879 --> 02:32:28,331
Again I will beat,

1565
02:32:29,006 --> 02:32:30,583
You will return

1566
02:32:31,049 --> 02:32:32,376
Will beat

1567
02:32:32,968 --> 02:32:34,420
When will we live?

1568
02:32:35,635 --> 02:32:40,524
I take a vow on Devarakota,
killing is the right thing to do.

1569
02:32:40,724 --> 02:35:24,543
Smoking and alcohol consumption
is injurious to health

1570
02:35:29,818 --> 02:36:25,887
Smoking and alcohol consumption
is injurious to health

1571
02:36:27,095 --> 02:36:32,649
Your will is a fireball to spread the
light to all the eight directions,

1572
02:36:32,850 --> 02:36:37,571
It’ll never fade out, never burn out,
till you reach your destiny.

1573
02:36:37,771 --> 02:36:43,283
Your dream is your sword, which tears
the darkness to bring in new light,

1574
02:36:43,482 --> 02:36:48,204
It’ll always stay sharp
to serve all the people in need.

1575
02:36:48,404 --> 02:36:52,406
Your idea that this whole life’s
purpose is to serve,

1576
02:36:52,407 --> 02:36:54,649
You’ve dedicated your life to
people and all around you.

1577
02:36:56,284 --> 02:36:58,652
Everything perished
due to short circuit.

1578
02:37:00,202 --> 02:37:02,655
Only the staff and me escaped..

1579
02:37:03,747 --> 02:37:06,200
The field papers and those people,
they got trapped.

1580
02:37:09,794 --> 02:37:14,848
Go forth, oh wealthy man,
get going, oh wealthy man.

1581
02:37:15,048 --> 02:37:18,617
We all bow down to your purpose!
Jai ho!

1582
02:37:18,816 --> 02:37:21,752
Next Year Sankranti Festival

1583
02:37:28,257 --> 02:37:29,850
What does Sankranti mean to you?

1584
02:37:30,049 --> 02:37:34,586
I saw that village, but our village is better.
There is nothing to beat our village

1585
02:37:35,553 --> 02:37:37,314
Why are you returning
this early Harsha?

1586
02:37:37,514 --> 02:37:39,231
Went to the neighbouring village
Venkatakrishnapuram.

1587
02:37:39,431 --> 02:37:42,432
This year there was a good crop
of dry chilli and peas.

1588
02:37:42,433 --> 02:37:45,344
I thought you will carry it
along while leaving.

1589
02:38:03,490 --> 02:38:06,818
Did you listen to me that day
when I told you

1590
02:38:07,493 --> 02:38:09,377
You take

1591
02:38:09,477 --> 02:38:13,974
You are looking like
golden doll in this saree

1592
02:38:15,232 --> 02:38:18,477
Whatever I say turns out to be true..
Do you know that?

1593
02:38:37,915 --> 02:38:41,869
By next Pongal,
you will have to give me a grandson

1594
02:38:46,379 --> 02:38:48,832
Did I ask correctly?
Did you see her blush?

1595
02:38:52,801 --> 02:38:58,672
By next year, mom in law
wants a grandson.. Shall we?

1596
02:39:01,390 --> 02:39:03,635
Will give...
