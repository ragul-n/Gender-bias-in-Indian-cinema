00:01:24,967 --> 00:01:27,242
FILMMAKERS VS TYCOONS

2
00:01:27,767 --> 00:01:29,598
A vampire with just one fang?

3
00:01:30,087 --> 00:01:32,317
A computer-colorised vampire?

4
00:01:34,687 --> 00:01:37,247
A vampire in full daylight?

5
00:01:45,407 --> 00:01:48,683
A Kurosawa samurai
speaking Basque?

6
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:19,685
This is a sacred place.
Delphi.

7
00:02:19,887 --> 00:02:22,526
The most famous oracle
of ancient times.

8
00:02:22,687 --> 00:02:25,406
Powerful men came
to consult the gods

9
00:02:25,567 --> 00:02:27,842
in search of a comforting answer.

10
00:02:28,727 --> 00:02:31,525
The Apollo temple was
built on these pillars.

11
00:02:31,727 --> 00:02:34,366
If you didn't see
the six of them,

12
00:02:34,847 --> 00:02:36,519
and my hat, of course,

13
00:02:36,727 --> 00:02:40,197
that would mean this film
is projected incorrectly.

14
00:02:41,647 --> 00:02:44,798
During the Peloponnesian War,
the Athenians believed

15
00:02:44,967 --> 00:02:48,277
the answers of the oracle
favoured the Spartans.

16
00:02:48,887 --> 00:02:50,445
The beginning of the end.

17
00:02:51,247 --> 00:02:52,999
Over 2.000 years later

18
00:02:53,247 --> 00:02:56,205
excavations brought these
stones to light again.

19
00:02:56,367 --> 00:03:00,326
Archaeologists study them
to get all possible information

20
00:03:00,487 --> 00:03:04,446
on who built the temples,
stadiums, amphitheatres.

21
00:03:08,607 --> 00:03:12,316
For 100 years, filmmakers,
like new archaeologists,

22
00:03:12,487 --> 00:03:16,446
have tried to explain
life in that era

23
00:03:16,607 --> 00:03:19,883
with images that have become
sacred to many of us.

24
00:03:20,447 --> 00:03:24,235
<i>Victorious, Pompey reached
the stronghold of the defeated.</i>

25
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:50,524
Much later,
in September of 1988,

26
00:03:50,687 --> 00:03:54,123
cultured people,
filmmakers, writers, musicians,

27
00:03:54,287 --> 00:03:56,243
actors from all over Europe,

28
00:03:56,407 --> 00:03:58,967
met here to defend their rights

29
00:03:59,207 --> 00:04:02,040
in face of the European
audiovisual crisis.

30
00:04:05,007 --> 00:04:08,966
<i>Yes, only sticking together
can we defeat them.</i>

31
00:04:09,767 --> 00:04:12,884
Did they meet here
thinking the oracles

32
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:15,043
always favoured the tycoons?

33
00:04:15,407 --> 00:04:17,477
Are the tycoons the new oracles?

34
00:04:19,247 --> 00:04:23,206
Or is this a place representing
the persistence of oblivion?

35
00:04:23,927 --> 00:04:26,202
The European Audiovisual
Charter proclaims:

36
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:34,526
And in Barcelona, a year
before Delphi, July 22nd, 1987,

37
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:36,798
the director Fred Zinnemann

38
00:05:36,967 --> 00:05:39,765
read the short but forceful
Barcelona Manifesto.

39
00:06:14,047 --> 00:06:16,322
When Zinnemann read these words

40
00:06:16,487 --> 00:06:20,196
the Spanish Intellectual Property Law
was still of the XIX century.

41
00:06:20,567 --> 00:06:22,797
But, a few month after
reading this,

42
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:25,237
November 11th of that same year,

43
00:06:25,407 --> 00:06:27,204
the new Spanish Law appeared,

44
00:06:27,367 --> 00:06:30,120
integrating the protection
of films and demanding:

45
00:06:30,287 --> 00:06:34,246
"Respect for integrity of works,
preventing any distortion,

46
00:06:34,407 --> 00:06:38,036
modification, alteration or
attempt against it

47
00:06:38,207 --> 00:06:41,882
that is in contempt of the author's
honour and reputation. "

48
00:07:16,847 --> 00:07:19,520
Having recourse to the new
Intellectual Property Law,

49
00:07:19,727 --> 00:07:23,686
in '88 a complaint was filed
against the TV screening of

50
00:07:23,847 --> 00:07:27,317
<i>Man of the West
that altered the original format</i>

51
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,603
in contempt of
Anthony Mann's reputation

52
00:07:29,767 --> 00:07:33,077
as a film director.
In other words, the author.

53
00:07:36,167 --> 00:07:39,204
It was the first filed for
a filmmaker's Moral Rights.

54
00:07:39,407 --> 00:07:43,320
But we know the Court never
reads the first complaint.

55
00:07:43,487 --> 00:07:45,717
And they just filed it away.

56
00:07:45,927 --> 00:07:48,316
But it was echoed in the press.

57
00:07:50,247 --> 00:07:53,478
And a few weeks later,
the same TV channel

58
00:07:53,687 --> 00:07:56,440
screened the film again
in its right format.

59
00:09:13,207 --> 00:09:16,483
Cinema was the main broadcasting
media this past century,

60
00:09:17,527 --> 00:09:21,076
becoming entertainment for
millions of people worldwide.

61
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:25,000
Seeing one of the first films now,

62
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:27,476
it seems strange that
such shaky images

63
00:09:27,647 --> 00:09:30,207
could impact so much
on the audience,

64
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:35,480
but it's because of the few
possibilities we have now

65
00:09:35,767 --> 00:09:37,485
of seeing a film of that era

66
00:09:37,647 --> 00:09:40,241
as it was projected originally.

67
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:43,120
The silent films screenings

68
00:09:43,327 --> 00:09:45,318
we not at all silent.

69
00:09:50,767 --> 00:09:53,998
Films were always accompanied
by live music played

70
00:09:54,167 --> 00:09:57,079
by an orchestra,
band or a pianist,

71
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:59,044
depending upon the theatre.

72
00:09:59,207 --> 00:10:01,926
Afterwards, when they
were screened, generally,

73
00:10:02,127 --> 00:10:03,958
they were screened at the

74
00:10:04,247 --> 00:10:07,364
present speed of
24 frames per second,

75
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:10,721
thus altering the original speed.

76
00:10:23,007 --> 00:10:26,602
Color systems were developed
from the very beginning.

77
00:10:26,887 --> 00:10:30,846
First they were hand painted,
frame by frame.

78
00:10:44,407 --> 00:10:48,366
Later on, color was generalised
by toning and tinting.

79
00:10:52,927 --> 00:10:55,725
Many films,
before the arrival of sound,

80
00:10:55,887 --> 00:10:58,481
had scenes shot in full color.

81
00:11:09,727 --> 00:11:12,639
When the spoken word
reached the cinema

82
00:11:12,847 --> 00:11:16,123
all previous productions became
useless to the merchants.

83
00:11:16,287 --> 00:11:20,246
Silent images being useless
to them, they dropped them.

84
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:24,835
Many films decomposed, and

85
00:11:25,847 --> 00:11:28,805
others were destroyed by fire.

86
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:38,957
But the majority were
destroyed by axe blows.

87
00:11:47,127 --> 00:11:50,597
Some were saved by
intrepid personal actions.

88
00:11:51,967 --> 00:11:54,800
Only 15% of silent films survived.

89
00:12:03,927 --> 00:12:07,636
Film destruction methods
became more modern.

90
00:12:07,887 --> 00:12:11,721
And so, works of Murnau,
Ford, Mizoguchi, Renoir, Ozu,

91
00:12:11,887 --> 00:12:15,516
Walsh, Dwan, Borzage,
Melies and many others

92
00:12:15,687 --> 00:12:17,962
found a very different destiny

93
00:12:18,127 --> 00:12:22,086
than that of their creation,
as explained in a newsreel.

94
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:26,598
<i>Yesterday, these celebrities
still enthused the world</i>

95
00:12:26,807 --> 00:12:29,719
<i>and today their films
are destroyed,</i>

96
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:38,846
<i>washed in a drum,
and their remains are melted.</i>

97
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:48,840
<i>Now women have on their nails
the man they loved so</i>

98
00:12:49,407 --> 00:12:53,241
<i>because nail polish is now
made of celluloid.</i>

99
00:12:53,687 --> 00:12:56,759
<i>And that is not their only trag</i>

100
00:12:57,047 --> 00:13:00,278
<i>The celluloid
becomes a thick paste</i>

101
00:13:02,887 --> 00:13:05,924
<i>and in the polish of their shoes</i>

102
00:13:06,087 --> 00:13:08,840
<i>they copy the smile of
a beautiful woman.</i>

103
00:13:11,927 --> 00:13:14,680
When the first talkies
got to the theatres

104
00:13:14,847 --> 00:13:17,839
the projectors were not
yet prepared for sound.

105
00:13:18,527 --> 00:13:20,563
The solution was drastic.

106
00:13:21,727 --> 00:13:29,315
O.V. (SOUND) / SPANISH V. (SILENT)

107
00:14:49,407 --> 00:14:51,363
Many years later...

108
00:15:09,327 --> 00:15:11,761
This is format 1:37,

109
00:15:12,927 --> 00:15:15,760
also called standard.

110
00:15:15,927 --> 00:15:17,804
You see, it's almost square.

111
00:15:18,007 --> 00:15:19,918
It's the talking film format.

112
00:15:20,447 --> 00:15:23,086
Before, in silent films,
it was wider.

113
00:15:23,247 --> 00:15:26,205
Space was not needed
for the sound track.

114
00:15:26,767 --> 00:15:29,918
So, now when copies
are made of silent films

115
00:15:30,087 --> 00:15:32,317
with the sound track filmed,

116
00:15:32,487 --> 00:15:35,320
this harms the original image.

117
00:15:40,967 --> 00:15:44,562
Each film should be projected
with the right catch

118
00:15:44,727 --> 00:15:47,287
for the format it was shot in.

119
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:50,925
If we take a film shot
in Scope,

120
00:15:51,447 --> 00:15:54,007
we see the image is longer.

121
00:15:54,167 --> 00:15:56,203
That is to say, anamorphised.

122
00:15:56,367 --> 00:15:59,200
Later it will be
the projector lens

123
00:15:59,367 --> 00:16:02,643
that deanamorphises it
and projects it on screen

124
00:16:02,847 --> 00:16:05,315
in a proportion of 2:35.

125
00:16:05,487 --> 00:16:08,797
Approximately twice
the standard format.

126
00:16:09,287 --> 00:16:11,642
It was as of 1953

127
00:16:11,807 --> 00:16:14,480
when, to compete with Scope,

128
00:16:14,647 --> 00:16:17,957
the panoramic formats appeared
in the United States.

129
00:16:18,167 --> 00:16:20,635
<i>This is a 1:66.</i>

130
00:16:24,087 --> 00:16:28,046
And this a 1:85,
which is even more panoramic.

131
00:16:35,287 --> 00:16:38,518
If a film shot in
format 1:37 is projected

132
00:16:38,767 --> 00:16:40,962
with one of these catches,

133
00:16:41,127 --> 00:16:44,915
which some negligent
projectionists do,

134
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,647
the result is catastrophic.

135
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:52,397
<i>I insert a 1:66.</i>

136
00:16:53,727 --> 00:16:55,718
And now a 1:85.

137
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:00,966
To not mutilate the film,
we should use proper catches

138
00:17:01,127 --> 00:17:02,606
and lenses

139
00:17:02,767 --> 00:17:05,759
that are adequate for the film format.

140
00:17:06,087 --> 00:17:10,046
A well-prepared room
should have all these catches,

141
00:17:10,207 --> 00:17:13,438
even the 1:75 format,

142
00:17:13,647 --> 00:17:17,606
an intermediate panoramic
used in very few films.

143
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:20,761
<i>The 1:66 was used more in Europe,</i>

144
00:17:20,927 --> 00:17:23,839
and the 1:85 in the United States,

145
00:17:24,047 --> 00:17:26,720
which I believe will
end up dominating,

146
00:17:27,007 --> 00:17:29,885
although good directors
such as Fellini

147
00:17:30,047 --> 00:17:33,437
<i>say the 1:66 is the perfect format</i>

148
00:17:33,607 --> 00:17:36,167
for a film.
I think so too, but

149
00:17:36,327 --> 00:17:38,761
the Americans are the Americans.

150
00:17:39,927 --> 00:17:42,805
We could also talk about 70 mm.,

151
00:17:43,007 --> 00:17:45,805
ultra 70, VistaVision,

152
00:17:45,967 --> 00:17:49,880
but that'll be some other day.
I'd like to insist on...

153
00:17:50,447 --> 00:17:51,926
You think out loud now?

154
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:55,358
I'm rehearsing a chat
I'll be giving on Saturday.

155
00:17:55,567 --> 00:17:56,522
In Spanish?

156
00:17:56,687 --> 00:18:00,600
If I give it in Catalan, they'd leave
before I get to CinemaScope.

157
00:18:00,927 --> 00:18:04,442
If we don't do something
we won't catch the bus.

158
00:18:04,727 --> 00:18:05,796
What do you mean?

159
00:18:06,007 --> 00:18:08,282
I told them these two films were

160
00:18:08,447 --> 00:18:10,438
too long to go together.

161
00:18:11,767 --> 00:18:15,601
- We'll leave a bit later.
- And miss the last bus.

162
00:18:16,127 --> 00:18:18,561
- What can I do?
- "What can I do?"

163
00:18:18,767 --> 00:18:21,600
As usual in these cases,
eliminate a reel.

164
00:18:22,047 --> 00:18:23,878
Don't just stand there.

165
00:18:24,087 --> 00:18:27,966
Don't project one of the middle reels

166
00:18:28,127 --> 00:18:29,719
and we gain 20 minutes.

167
00:18:30,087 --> 00:18:33,284
If anyone realises, they'll think
it was the censorship.

168
00:18:34,007 --> 00:18:37,795
- That's not right.
- Neither are such long films.

169
00:18:38,047 --> 00:18:40,197
Who makes them are inconsiderate.

170
00:18:40,847 --> 00:18:43,122
There's hardly a soul
at the last showing.

171
00:18:43,407 --> 00:18:46,205
It doesn't matter.
We don't need 20 minutes

172
00:18:46,367 --> 00:18:48,244
to get to the bus stop.

173
00:18:48,407 --> 00:18:51,479
If we leave before
half past we'll make it.

174
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:54,036
If we have to grab a cab,
you'll pay it.

175
00:18:54,207 --> 00:18:55,879
Look, on all showings

176
00:18:56,087 --> 00:18:58,681
<i>I'll use a speed of 26 frames.</i>

177
00:18:58,967 --> 00:19:01,322
All right, 27.

178
00:19:06,407 --> 00:19:08,637
- Has bus 43 come yet?
- Not yet.

179
00:19:08,967 --> 00:19:12,516
- Doesn't it come at half past?
- It leaves Les Corts then.

180
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:15,317
You see there was no need to rush?

181
00:19:18,127 --> 00:19:20,322
At least he has
a guilty conscience.

182
00:19:21,287 --> 00:19:24,404
That has been lost over the years.

183
00:19:24,967 --> 00:19:27,197
The French filmmaker
Jean Charles Tachella,

184
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:29,722
towards the end of 1987,
complained about

185
00:19:29,887 --> 00:19:32,959
the use of a diabolical device
from Massachusetts.

186
00:19:33,967 --> 00:19:35,195
Things have changed!

187
00:19:35,367 --> 00:19:37,881
Half a century ago,
who came from there

188
00:19:38,047 --> 00:19:39,924
was the incredible Jonathan Clark.

189
00:19:41,887 --> 00:19:43,718
The Boston Man.

190
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:49,481
A device now called Lexicon
Audio Timer Compressor,

191
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:52,115
which can speed up
a film on television

192
00:19:52,887 --> 00:19:55,355
up to ten times its normal speed,

193
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,995
apparently without
the audience noticing.

194
00:20:01,247 --> 00:20:05,160
We can see the effects here
with the great Francisco Rabal.

195
00:20:17,887 --> 00:20:20,196
In this way,
the TV channel can sell

196
00:20:20,367 --> 00:20:22,005
more publicity time

197
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:24,761
within the space
dedicated to the film.

198
00:20:38,887 --> 00:20:42,516
With the arrival of TV
the film alterations have soared

199
00:20:42,687 --> 00:20:44,917
and each change in
reproduction technology

200
00:20:45,127 --> 00:20:49,006
brings new systems that
alter films, and destroy the original.

201
00:22:11,927 --> 00:22:14,964
Maybe the only solution
is professor Mallol's invention.

202
00:22:16,087 --> 00:22:17,520
- Hail.
- Hi, professor.

203
00:22:17,727 --> 00:22:19,445
Hello, beautiful. Look,

204
00:22:19,607 --> 00:22:22,838
here I have the format
alteration detector.

205
00:22:23,007 --> 00:22:26,886
All you do is indicate
the format here,

206
00:22:27,047 --> 00:22:28,241
and that's it.

207
00:22:28,407 --> 00:22:32,320
- What if they are colorised?
- No problem, it's automatic.

208
00:22:32,487 --> 00:22:33,317
Fantastic.

209
00:22:33,607 --> 00:22:35,723
So, here, for you.

210
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:38,245
See you, God willing,

211
00:22:39,127 --> 00:22:41,561
and forgive me for
not coming sooner

212
00:22:41,767 --> 00:22:43,803
but I was loaded down with work.

213
00:22:43,967 --> 00:22:45,446
- Don't worry.
- Bye.

214
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:04,926
<i>The sun is very important.</i>

215
00:24:06,127 --> 00:24:08,721
<i>If the sun dies, everyone dies.</i>

216
00:24:09,207 --> 00:24:12,165
<i>The moon is also important.</i>

217
00:24:21,687 --> 00:24:24,247
Juan Fernández Navarrete,
known as The Mute,

218
00:24:24,407 --> 00:24:26,204
was a painter from Logroño.

219
00:24:26,367 --> 00:24:29,404
He became deaf when
he was three years old.

220
00:24:29,567 --> 00:24:31,159
He never learned to speak.

221
00:24:31,327 --> 00:24:33,966
He learned painting
with Titian in Italy.

222
00:24:34,127 --> 00:24:37,278
In 1568, when he was 42 years old,

223
00:24:37,447 --> 00:24:39,199
the king of Spain asked him

224
00:24:39,367 --> 00:24:41,881
to work on the greatest work
of art of that era.

225
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:44,845
When a painting of his
maestro arrived,

226
00:24:45,007 --> 00:24:47,077
he went to see it immediately.

227
00:24:50,287 --> 00:24:53,438
Navarrete knew he still
had a lot to learn from him

228
00:24:54,527 --> 00:24:57,121
and that increased his admiration.

229
00:25:19,567 --> 00:25:21,000
7 arms and a half.

230
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:24,520
<i>Titian's The Last Supper,
from Italy.</i>

231
00:25:25,127 --> 00:25:28,085
Soon it will preside
in the refectory,

232
00:25:28,287 --> 00:25:30,164
as ordered by His Majesty.

233
00:25:30,407 --> 00:25:31,806
Measurements are

234
00:25:31,967 --> 00:25:35,039
7 and a half arms long,
and 3 high.

235
00:25:36,087 --> 00:25:40,046
I'm afraid the painting
does not fit in the refectory,

236
00:25:40,447 --> 00:25:42,642
from which I infer, sir, that

237
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:45,806
cutting it is the only solution.

238
00:25:47,687 --> 00:25:50,918
The Mute was furious.
Mutilate his maestro's work?

239
00:25:51,087 --> 00:25:52,406
The king wouldn't allow it.

240
00:25:52,647 --> 00:25:54,239
His Majesty the King!

241
00:26:13,367 --> 00:26:15,039
What are you doing here?

242
00:26:16,927 --> 00:26:18,758
This is not your place.

243
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:31,716
I admire how well
Titian does things.

244
00:26:32,407 --> 00:26:33,840
You are right, Your Majesty,

245
00:26:34,287 --> 00:26:37,404
but had he followed
our measurements,

246
00:26:37,727 --> 00:26:38,796
it would be perfect.

247
00:26:39,207 --> 00:26:41,846
The painting surpasses exceedingly

248
00:26:42,047 --> 00:26:45,881
the measurements of
the main refectory wall.

249
00:26:47,207 --> 00:26:49,243
What do you advise me to do then?

250
00:26:49,687 --> 00:26:51,484
With your consent,

251
00:26:51,847 --> 00:26:55,760
the painting should be cut.
There is no other alternative.

252
00:26:56,327 --> 00:26:58,079
It is perfect as is.

253
00:26:58,407 --> 00:27:01,683
Proportional, exact.
Why destroy it?

254
00:27:11,567 --> 00:27:13,125
It will not be destroyed.

255
00:27:13,287 --> 00:27:16,563
We will only adjust it
by cutting the sides.

256
00:27:16,727 --> 00:27:19,116
In short, no apostle will be lost,

257
00:27:19,327 --> 00:27:22,285
and no harm will come to
the maestro's signature.

258
00:27:23,447 --> 00:27:25,563
Why not put it somewhere else?

259
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:28,605
It would fit on the side
wall of the refectory.

260
00:27:31,687 --> 00:27:35,123
You dare insinuate Titian's
painting on a side wall?

261
00:27:35,847 --> 00:27:39,237
<i>The Last Supperdeserves
a preferential place.</i>

262
00:27:40,927 --> 00:27:41,882
Cut?

263
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:44,479
Don't make the effort.

264
00:27:44,807 --> 00:27:47,560
It was ordered to
preside the refectory,

265
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:50,076
and will be hung on the main wall.

266
00:27:51,647 --> 00:27:54,923
<i>Navarrete offered to paint
an exact copy in 6 months,</i>

267
00:27:55,087 --> 00:27:56,918
with their measurements.

268
00:27:57,167 --> 00:27:58,839
And free of charge.

269
00:28:05,887 --> 00:28:07,684
Behead him if he didn't!

270
00:28:07,887 --> 00:28:10,355
Your copy in such
a prominent place?

271
00:28:10,527 --> 00:28:12,597
You have high esteem of yourself.

272
00:28:12,807 --> 00:28:16,322
<i>Impossible to wait 6 months.
Time is pressing.</i>

273
00:28:42,727 --> 00:28:46,037
And you limit yourself
to your own paintings.

274
00:28:55,927 --> 00:28:57,360
Paint, Mute, paint.

275
00:28:58,287 --> 00:28:59,242
Mute!

276
00:29:26,887 --> 00:29:30,675
It was cut and set in a place
of honour in the refectory.

277
00:29:34,367 --> 00:29:36,676
This is the highest
prize in movies.

278
00:29:37,367 --> 00:29:41,121
20th Century Fox has
won it many times.

279
00:29:41,287 --> 00:29:44,359
But, very specifically, twice

280
00:29:44,527 --> 00:29:46,438
for technological discoveries.

281
00:29:46,807 --> 00:29:49,640
In 1955, Fox won the Oscar

282
00:29:49,807 --> 00:29:52,162
for discovering
the CinemaScope lenses.

283
00:30:57,767 --> 00:31:00,804
The success of this new
format was so spectacular

284
00:31:00,967 --> 00:31:03,720
that films having
ended their career

285
00:31:03,887 --> 00:31:07,004
were released again
in Scope format,

286
00:31:07,167 --> 00:31:10,284
although this altered
their original composition.

287
00:31:12,567 --> 00:31:15,604
One film sacrificed
for this new system

288
00:31:15,767 --> 00:31:17,758
<i>was Welcome, Mr. Marshall.</i>

289
00:31:27,127 --> 00:31:29,721
How stupid, this fuckin' Scope.

290
00:31:29,927 --> 00:31:32,566
No, I had no fuckin' idea, really.

291
00:31:32,727 --> 00:31:36,197
No one told me they had offered

292
00:31:36,367 --> 00:31:39,837
screenings in Scope that,
fortunately,

293
00:31:40,007 --> 00:31:43,238
were not many because
I don't think that

294
00:31:43,407 --> 00:31:46,399
after its commercial career
it would...

295
00:31:46,607 --> 00:31:48,518
In a way, I deserved it because,

296
00:31:49,287 --> 00:31:51,721
once I finish,

297
00:31:51,887 --> 00:31:55,084
I don't see my films again...

298
00:31:55,527 --> 00:31:58,200
And now, on it's 50th
anniversary it's back in theatres.

299
00:31:58,407 --> 00:32:00,159
And, as usual,

300
00:32:00,327 --> 00:32:04,240
it's always shown in 1:85 format,
and it's been a disaster.

301
00:32:05,687 --> 00:32:07,564
This is the original format.

302
00:32:08,487 --> 00:32:11,126
Screened like this,
cut here and here.

303
00:32:11,727 --> 00:32:13,718
Half Manolo Morán's face but,

304
00:32:13,967 --> 00:32:17,880
that's a bitch.
This format thing is hell.

305
00:32:18,047 --> 00:32:21,926
At the shoot I'd have
cut his entire face out

306
00:32:22,527 --> 00:32:26,486
because Manolo was a bit of
a bastard to me but, well...

307
00:32:26,807 --> 00:32:29,162
The only solution
would be to print

308
00:32:29,327 --> 00:32:32,000
the original 1:37 format
within the 1:85.

309
00:32:32,447 --> 00:32:35,439
That would respect it,
although giving in

310
00:32:35,607 --> 00:32:37,484
to the exhibition dictatorship.

311
00:32:37,887 --> 00:32:41,516
A few years later massive
sales to TV began and

312
00:32:41,727 --> 00:32:45,197
the CinemaScope format
was not the most appropriate.

313
00:32:45,367 --> 00:32:48,040
What came about to
fight against TV

314
00:32:48,207 --> 00:32:50,277
now succumbed to it.

315
00:32:50,607 --> 00:32:53,485
The 20th Century Fox
inventors got to work

316
00:32:53,927 --> 00:32:56,999
and, once again,
in 1961, Fox won the Oscar

317
00:32:57,167 --> 00:32:59,158
to technological advances.

318
00:32:59,367 --> 00:33:01,801
This time for inventing lenses

319
00:33:01,967 --> 00:33:05,926
that adapt anamorphic Cinemascope
images to standar format.

320
00:33:06,807 --> 00:33:10,083
<i>A device known as
panning-scanning.</i>

321
00:33:10,687 --> 00:33:12,723
A diabolical invention
that contracts,

322
00:33:12,887 --> 00:33:16,766
cuts, quarters and adapts
original frames to the TV screen.

323
00:33:18,407 --> 00:33:22,366
Contracts credits,
adapting them to the TV format.

324
00:33:23,727 --> 00:33:27,163
It selects composition and can
convert one shot into a dozen.

325
00:33:32,327 --> 00:33:35,364
Selects the desired image,

326
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:39,519
from one side to the other
of the original.

327
00:33:44,207 --> 00:33:48,120
At times the execution
technicians have a problem.

328
00:33:49,287 --> 00:33:51,562
Joan, look at this a moment.

329
00:33:53,767 --> 00:33:55,917
What do I focus on,
him or the match?

330
00:33:56,527 --> 00:33:58,882
Both.
First Lawrence

331
00:33:59,767 --> 00:34:01,997
and panning the match.

332
00:34:02,927 --> 00:34:05,077
There's not enough footage.

333
00:34:06,287 --> 00:34:08,403
First frame Lawrence alone,
and record.

334
00:34:14,007 --> 00:34:16,999
Now rewind the 35 to the same spot

335
00:34:19,767 --> 00:34:20,517
again and

336
00:34:26,487 --> 00:34:27,886
record the match.

337
00:34:28,047 --> 00:34:30,800
- And the sound?
- It's for TV. We'll fix it later.

338
00:34:32,607 --> 00:34:34,802
At the slap, who do I frame?

339
00:34:35,767 --> 00:34:37,166
We'll flip a coin.

340
00:34:39,047 --> 00:34:40,719
Heads Lawrence, tails the match.

341
00:38:17,967 --> 00:38:21,403
<i>Once Snows of Kilimanjaro
is over</i>

342
00:38:21,607 --> 00:38:25,520
we will offer you the World
Mus Card Game Championship

343
00:38:25,727 --> 00:38:29,606
in wich the Spaniard
Juan Carlos Rentero

344
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:33,766
has great possibilities
of carring off the title.

345
00:38:43,367 --> 00:38:45,927
Among these stones
brimming with legend,

346
00:38:46,087 --> 00:38:49,557
where some consider the Cathars
hid the Holy Grail,

347
00:38:49,807 --> 00:38:53,686
an image of the Virgin Mary
was found centuries ago.

348
00:38:53,847 --> 00:38:56,964
The Virgin of Montserrat has
been worshiped for centuries.

349
00:38:57,167 --> 00:39:00,125
Since her consecration
as patron saint of Catalonia

350
00:39:00,327 --> 00:39:03,205
this mountain is
a place of pilgrimage.

351
00:39:03,367 --> 00:39:07,280
<i>Due to its dark color,
it is considered La Moreneta.</i>

352
00:39:09,487 --> 00:39:13,082
In 2001, scientists discovered
it had been colorised.

353
00:39:13,247 --> 00:39:14,999
The original was white.

354
00:39:15,167 --> 00:39:18,125
It was painted black
200 years after.

355
00:39:21,207 --> 00:39:24,404
The legend of Mediterranean
black virgins had spread

356
00:39:24,807 --> 00:39:27,401
and someone made
the legend come true.

357
00:39:28,247 --> 00:39:31,557
<i>Hundreds of speculations
were made on La Moreneta color.</i>

358
00:39:32,447 --> 00:39:35,757
No one knew it was
all a manipulation.

359
00:39:36,047 --> 00:39:38,515
The same thing
can happen in films.

360
00:39:38,687 --> 00:39:40,996
We can still remember that

361
00:39:41,207 --> 00:39:43,596
a specific film is
in black and white,

362
00:39:43,807 --> 00:39:46,367
but if it is colorised
and exhibited,

363
00:39:46,567 --> 00:39:50,196
within a few years no one
will know what the original was like.

364
00:39:50,367 --> 00:39:52,835
The Church never acts
without a cause.

365
00:39:53,367 --> 00:39:57,280
It may seem mysterious to us,
but it's always fair.

366
00:39:57,567 --> 00:40:01,526
2 centuries ago, it was decided
to colorise the Mother of God.

367
00:40:01,967 --> 00:40:05,164
It was no whim of any
clergyman or lay person,

368
00:40:05,447 --> 00:40:08,962
but an authentic technical need.
The image was deteriorating.

369
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:11,767
The smoke from the candles
of the faithful

370
00:40:11,967 --> 00:40:15,721
and dirt darkened the natural
beauty of the carving.

371
00:40:15,887 --> 00:40:18,526
And that's why they colorised it,

372
00:40:18,687 --> 00:40:21,565
to avoid further deterioration.

373
00:40:21,727 --> 00:40:23,445
They were restoring it.

374
00:40:23,967 --> 00:40:27,004
If you spoke English,
I'd think this is Atlanta,

375
00:40:28,007 --> 00:40:30,316
and you, Mr. Ted Turner.

376
00:46:52,487 --> 00:46:56,275
When talking of colorising films

377
00:46:56,447 --> 00:46:57,596
I always ask:

378
00:46:57,887 --> 00:47:01,004
Who can colorise Dreyer's films?

379
00:47:01,807 --> 00:47:05,766
<i>Can you imagine colorising
Jeanne d'Arc, Vampyr,</i>

380
00:47:06,367 --> 00:47:08,835
<i>Dies Irae, or Gertrud?</i>

381
00:47:09,247 --> 00:47:11,397
I bet you can't even
imagine it, can you?

382
00:47:11,607 --> 00:47:15,043
If anyone tries to colorise
one of my father's films

383
00:47:15,527 --> 00:47:16,562
I'd shoot them.

384
00:47:16,807 --> 00:47:19,275
Well, not really,
I'm no murderer.

385
00:47:19,967 --> 00:47:23,277
And I mean not only
his major great works

386
00:47:23,447 --> 00:47:27,156
as a director, but also
the over 100 films as an actor.

387
00:47:27,727 --> 00:47:31,640
<i>For all films, I am not
my father's worshiper.</i>

388
00:47:31,887 --> 00:47:34,765
My father's films
have been restored

389
00:47:34,927 --> 00:47:38,556
because I have realised
people watch TV,

390
00:47:38,727 --> 00:47:41,321
which has taken cinema
itself over,

391
00:47:41,487 --> 00:47:45,241
and they think the perfectly
digitalised films seen on TV,

392
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:48,365
on satellite or open channels,

393
00:47:48,567 --> 00:47:52,037
exist as such,
but they are only tapes,

394
00:47:52,207 --> 00:47:54,880
made specially for television,

395
00:47:55,087 --> 00:47:58,557
that are transcribed at
the moment of selling

396
00:47:58,727 --> 00:48:02,606
a TV broadcast
by the film producers.

397
00:48:02,967 --> 00:48:06,846
So, just any film,
which isn't very old,

398
00:48:07,047 --> 00:48:09,686
<i>even Bertolucci's
The Conformist</i>

399
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:12,879
Storaro, director of photography,
couldn't achieve,

400
00:48:13,047 --> 00:48:16,756
even keeping the 3
fundamental color arrays,

401
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:20,476
he was unable to achieve

402
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:24,435
the same tone of that moment.

403
00:48:24,607 --> 00:48:27,758
This is work
that dissolves quickly.

404
00:48:28,327 --> 00:48:30,602
In the case of our Association,

405
00:48:30,767 --> 00:48:34,476
we work under my
father's indications

406
00:48:34,647 --> 00:48:37,480
on this, his best film,
and started

407
00:48:37,647 --> 00:48:40,115
with the most deteriorated film,

408
00:48:40,567 --> 00:48:44,355
<i>Shoeshine, which is
the most difficult of all.</i>

409
00:48:45,287 --> 00:48:49,166
But we have had trouble
with other films also,

410
00:48:49,327 --> 00:48:52,399
<i>like Miracle in Milan,
The Bicycle Thief,</i>

411
00:48:52,567 --> 00:48:56,526
<i>although much less with
The Children Are Watching Us,</i>

412
00:48:56,687 --> 00:49:00,566
those with less success,

413
00:49:00,767 --> 00:49:02,405
with less prints made.

414
00:49:02,727 --> 00:49:05,446
Many times
perfect negative are found

415
00:49:05,607 --> 00:49:08,804
from a time we didn't suspect
they were perfect.

416
00:49:09,047 --> 00:49:12,244
So we have taken
the original negative

417
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:13,635
of the legal owners.

418
00:49:13,807 --> 00:49:17,277
And have made a
restored version

419
00:49:17,447 --> 00:49:20,723
constructing, after a laborious

420
00:49:20,927 --> 00:49:22,076
and costly

421
00:49:23,447 --> 00:49:25,722
elaboration of the material,

422
00:49:25,887 --> 00:49:28,162
a second negative

423
00:49:28,327 --> 00:49:31,922
capable of remaining
for future generations

424
00:49:32,087 --> 00:49:35,363
in memory of the film
understood as

425
00:49:35,527 --> 00:49:37,119
the original film.

426
00:49:37,567 --> 00:49:41,276
<i>There can be cases like
Miracle in Milan,</i>

427
00:49:41,447 --> 00:49:45,281
in the finale with the beggars
hanging from black cables,

428
00:49:45,447 --> 00:49:47,722
visible in the light background,

429
00:49:48,007 --> 00:49:50,316
with which they flew over Milan.

430
00:50:01,287 --> 00:50:04,723
We deleted them from
the computer because my father

431
00:50:04,887 --> 00:50:07,447
would not have wanted
them to be seen.

432
00:50:07,887 --> 00:50:11,766
It's not philologically correct,
but it is a version.

433
00:50:12,567 --> 00:50:15,240
I must say no one
can ever destroy

434
00:50:15,407 --> 00:50:19,366
an original.

435
00:50:19,967 --> 00:50:23,926
A restored version can be made,

436
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:27,844
always respecting
the original film,

437
00:50:28,007 --> 00:50:30,999
but creating a photography

438
00:50:31,927 --> 00:50:32,723
in reply

439
00:50:33,007 --> 00:50:36,158
without any scratches.

440
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:40,246
Therefore, you can let people

441
00:50:40,487 --> 00:50:44,196
screen the film
in a movie theatre.

442
00:50:44,367 --> 00:50:46,119
No! No way!

443
00:50:46,887 --> 00:50:50,038
No one should ever alter a film,

444
00:50:50,207 --> 00:50:51,686
not even the author.

445
00:50:52,127 --> 00:50:55,358
That is exactly the case
of De Sica in

446
00:50:55,527 --> 00:50:56,801
<i>Miracle in Milan.</i>

447
00:50:56,967 --> 00:51:00,926
In the finale the characters
fly over the cathedral

448
00:51:01,687 --> 00:51:04,804
and people say these
characters were

449
00:51:04,967 --> 00:51:07,117
hanging from cables I never saw.

450
00:51:07,287 --> 00:51:08,766
I saw the film many times.

451
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:12,886
They say he tried,
which was very delicate at the time,

452
00:51:13,047 --> 00:51:16,084
very difficult,
to get rid of the cables.

453
00:51:16,367 --> 00:51:18,835
I am sure today,

454
00:51:19,647 --> 00:51:23,003
if De Sica saw the film,
he wouldn't remove them.

455
00:51:23,207 --> 00:51:25,482
He wouldn't worry, and with his

456
00:51:25,727 --> 00:51:29,242
works standing,
and this film specifically,

457
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:32,080
he would probably feel
very satisfied

458
00:51:32,327 --> 00:51:36,081
to see that the characters
that soar above the cathedral

459
00:51:36,247 --> 00:51:38,841
are hanging from cables.

460
00:51:39,807 --> 00:51:41,923
His son is

461
00:51:43,847 --> 00:51:46,407
updating because films get old

462
00:51:46,567 --> 00:51:49,684
and, naturally, must be cleaned,

463
00:51:49,847 --> 00:51:52,680
missing scenes must be found,
prints made

464
00:51:52,847 --> 00:51:56,806
so as to reproduce and
leave the negative,

465
00:51:56,967 --> 00:51:59,083
the film,

466
00:51:59,247 --> 00:52:01,886
as the author left it,
as it should be.

467
00:52:02,047 --> 00:52:05,756
And now, with modern technology,
it seems he can.

468
00:52:06,007 --> 00:52:09,920
He removed all cables and
the characters really fly.

469
00:52:13,567 --> 00:52:16,877
That is very bad!
It should not be tolerated!

470
00:52:17,367 --> 00:52:21,246
I think even De Sica
would agree with me.

471
00:52:21,447 --> 00:52:24,678
You can't alter a film from
the way it was shot.

472
00:52:26,207 --> 00:52:30,086
<i>There's another example,
Griffith's Birth of a Nation</i>

473
00:52:30,327 --> 00:52:33,285
An American senator, one of those

474
00:52:33,487 --> 00:52:37,446
little men who invent,
who dispute laws,

475
00:52:37,607 --> 00:52:41,486
received a complaint from
a group of lucid directors

476
00:52:42,287 --> 00:52:45,882
demanding their films
never be altered,

477
00:52:46,087 --> 00:52:49,443
not even in subsequent screenings.

478
00:52:49,607 --> 00:52:53,486
They defended
the authenticity of their films.

479
00:52:53,647 --> 00:52:56,525
The little man said:
"Why do you say that?"

480
00:52:56,687 --> 00:52:58,803
He had certain information,

481
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:01,640
because Griffith,

482
00:53:02,487 --> 00:53:04,045
<i>in Birth of a Nation,</i>

483
00:53:04,247 --> 00:53:07,762
a very delicate film
according to the audience,

484
00:53:07,927 --> 00:53:10,885
inserted different scenes
in accordance with

485
00:53:11,047 --> 00:53:14,801
the ethnic groups,
the State it was shown in.

486
00:53:14,967 --> 00:53:18,164
The difference between North
and South, evident in U.S.A.

487
00:53:18,327 --> 00:53:21,683
He made various changes
with different scenes

488
00:53:21,847 --> 00:53:23,678
to express different ideas.

489
00:53:23,887 --> 00:53:26,765
And the naive directors,

490
00:53:26,927 --> 00:53:30,317
those important and
far away colleagues,

491
00:53:32,487 --> 00:53:35,957
said: "But, man,
he did that himself. "

492
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:37,799
That should not be done!

493
00:53:38,087 --> 00:53:42,000
But Griffith made no changes,
he made different films.

494
00:53:42,967 --> 00:53:45,481
Each film having
a reasonable change,

495
00:53:45,647 --> 00:53:49,162
to be accepted differently
or causing awareness,

496
00:53:49,327 --> 00:53:52,285
was a different film.
He made different films.

497
00:54:07,927 --> 00:54:11,681
<i>Once Snows of Kilimanjaro
is over</i>

498
00:54:11,887 --> 00:54:15,675
we will offer you the World
Mus Card Game Championship

499
00:54:15,847 --> 00:54:18,486
in wich the Spaniard
Juan Carlos Rentero

500
00:54:18,647 --> 00:54:22,606
has great possibilities
of carring off the title.

501
00:54:26,167 --> 00:54:28,920
A lecture by Victor Hugo
in 1874 was the

502
00:54:29,087 --> 00:54:31,157
basis for regulating Authors' Rights.

503
00:54:31,607 --> 00:54:34,041
2 years later,
the Berne Treaty was signed.

504
00:54:34,207 --> 00:54:36,277
It went through sessions
in Paris and Berlin

505
00:54:36,447 --> 00:54:40,122
until 1928, when in Rome the
established Authors' Rights were

506
00:54:40,287 --> 00:54:42,243
added to the Moral Rights.

507
00:54:43,367 --> 00:54:45,642
"Independent of the author's
Patrimonial Rights,

508
00:54:45,807 --> 00:54:47,923
and even after giving them up,

509
00:54:48,127 --> 00:54:50,800
the author can claim
paternity of his works

510
00:54:50,967 --> 00:54:54,243
and object to any distortion,
mutilation or modification

511
00:54:54,407 --> 00:54:58,366
or attempt that may harm
his honour or reputation. "

512
00:54:58,967 --> 00:55:02,926
The treaty was discussed in
Brussels, Geneva, Stockholm,

513
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:05,681
and in 1971, in Paris,

514
00:55:05,967 --> 00:55:09,596
<i>artistic forms not existing
in 1886 were admitted,</i>

515
00:55:09,847 --> 00:55:11,883
including motion pictures.

516
00:55:12,047 --> 00:55:16,006
The Berne Treaty
was ratified in 1973,

517
00:55:16,247 --> 00:55:17,600
and states:

518
00:55:17,887 --> 00:55:21,004
"Motion pictures will be
protected as originals.

519
00:55:21,207 --> 00:55:23,880
The authors of the film

520
00:55:24,047 --> 00:55:27,278
will have the same rights
as any other author. "

521
00:56:40,087 --> 00:56:43,875
In May '87, North American
directors went to Washington.

522
00:56:44,047 --> 00:56:46,959
The commission was
Elliot Silverstein,

523
00:56:47,207 --> 00:56:49,516
Sydney Pollack, Milos Forman
and Woody Allen.

524
00:56:49,687 --> 00:56:52,645
They were accompanied by
Ginger Rogers,

525
00:56:52,807 --> 00:56:55,844
James Stewart and a fighting
Burt Lancaster.

526
00:59:23,207 --> 00:59:26,005
Senator Leahy told
Woody Allen that

527
00:59:26,167 --> 00:59:30,080
they could protect modifications
of their films with a contract,

528
00:59:30,247 --> 00:59:32,442
as Allen himself had done,

529
00:59:32,807 --> 00:59:36,595
which prevented showing some
of his films on TV.

530
01:04:11,927 --> 01:04:15,556
The senator seemed very interested
in Milos Forman's testimony,

531
01:04:15,767 --> 01:04:18,076
maybe because he is European.

532
01:06:43,687 --> 01:06:47,646
To counteract Forman, senator
Leahy addressed Sydney Pollack

533
01:06:47,847 --> 01:06:50,805
accusing the directors
of being the manipulators,

534
01:06:50,967 --> 01:06:53,686
modifying other authors
of novels and

535
01:06:53,847 --> 01:06:55,644
turning these around.

536
01:06:55,807 --> 01:06:58,367
And used John Huston
as an example because

537
01:06:58,527 --> 01:07:02,486
<i>in The Maltese Falcon he
changed Dashiell Hammmet's finale.</i>

538
01:08:56,767 --> 01:08:59,964
Elliot Silverstein
ended the session

539
01:09:00,127 --> 01:09:02,925
determining the Directors'
Guild stance.

540
01:13:28,807 --> 01:13:31,958
When we make a film

541
01:13:32,807 --> 01:13:36,766
we think about the country
in which we make it,

542
01:13:38,007 --> 01:13:41,841
we think about Italy,
about distribution,

543
01:13:42,007 --> 01:13:44,646
about an audience that

544
01:13:44,847 --> 01:13:47,042
we know a bit about.

545
01:13:49,487 --> 01:13:52,001
When the film leaves Italy,
for example,

546
01:13:52,167 --> 01:13:55,239
once the theatrical
exploitation is over,

547
01:13:55,687 --> 01:13:59,362
there is a whole
very strong market

548
01:13:59,527 --> 01:14:02,519
for DVD, video tapes,

549
01:14:03,367 --> 01:14:07,326
the film has a story
that lasts, that

550
01:14:10,247 --> 01:14:13,842
later depends on its quality,
a lasting story.

551
01:14:14,087 --> 01:14:17,841
Today, quite clearly,
there is a series of steps,

552
01:14:18,007 --> 01:14:19,520
changes of property

553
01:14:19,727 --> 01:14:23,276
in the sense of being granted
to a foreign company

554
01:14:23,807 --> 01:14:27,277
which, in turn, carries out
another sort of exploitation.

555
01:14:27,687 --> 01:14:30,042
In a certain way,

556
01:14:31,447 --> 01:14:34,837
this is objectively
uncontrollable at

557
01:14:35,247 --> 01:14:38,603
the level of Italian reality

558
01:14:39,167 --> 01:14:43,126
in which we can only
give our support and hope

559
01:14:43,567 --> 01:14:47,196
that this film that will later

560
01:14:50,087 --> 01:14:53,966
go on its way and
move further away

561
01:14:55,167 --> 01:14:59,080
from the author's control,

562
01:15:00,087 --> 01:15:03,875
whether it is presented and exhibited

563
01:15:04,087 --> 01:15:06,840
to the world uncut,

564
01:15:08,847 --> 01:15:12,806
exhibited with subtitles

565
01:15:13,007 --> 01:15:16,966
in the language of that country,

566
01:15:17,167 --> 01:15:20,557
but with its integrity
safeguarded.

567
01:15:23,687 --> 01:15:27,646
From my point of view,
that is an evident wish

568
01:15:28,487 --> 01:15:31,285
and I think it is a right

569
01:15:31,607 --> 01:15:33,677
being acknowledged

570
01:15:34,767 --> 01:15:36,678
to the author.

571
01:15:48,687 --> 01:15:51,963
<i>Once Snows of Kilimanjaro
is over</i>

572
01:15:52,167 --> 01:15:56,001
we will offer you the World
Mus Card Game Championship

573
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:59,040
in wich the Spaniard
Juan Carlos Rentero

574
01:15:59,247 --> 01:16:03,206
has great possibilities
of carring off the title.

575
01:17:25,567 --> 01:17:27,046
<i>Don't be so methodical,</i>

576
01:17:27,447 --> 01:17:30,325
<i>the best way to travel
is to let yourself go.</i>

577
01:17:31,047 --> 01:17:34,596
<i>We will take you to
the depths of the world.</i>

578
01:17:35,167 --> 01:17:38,398
<i>Dream places you have
always wanted to visit.</i>

579
01:17:39,287 --> 01:17:41,801
<i>The 5 continents at your reach.</i>

580
01:17:42,007 --> 01:17:44,726
<i>Full comfort at the best price.</i>

581
01:17:45,007 --> 01:17:46,998
<i>With the best organization.</i>

582
01:17:47,927 --> 01:17:51,715
<i>New Horizons Travels
sponsors this concert.</i>

583
01:19:54,927 --> 01:19:58,886
But we're still here talking
about these things.

584
01:19:59,527 --> 01:20:00,755
It's incredible

585
01:20:01,207 --> 01:20:04,517
because I'm convinced
that these people

586
01:20:05,167 --> 01:20:09,126
being fought against,
this group, these invaders,

587
01:20:10,367 --> 01:20:13,086
and the people behind that group,

588
01:20:13,247 --> 01:20:14,646
taken one by one,

589
01:20:14,847 --> 01:20:17,725
they would admit
they agree with us.

590
01:20:17,927 --> 01:20:21,283
They are defending a wrong cause

591
01:20:21,687 --> 01:20:25,521
with inadmissible arrogance.

592
01:20:25,687 --> 01:20:28,076
One by one,
they would say we're right.

593
01:20:28,287 --> 01:20:31,723
And now, ten years after
the debate began,

594
01:20:31,887 --> 01:20:35,482
we're at the same starting
point. It's incredible.

595
01:20:35,647 --> 01:20:38,445
They don't risk believing

596
01:20:38,927 --> 01:20:41,680
it is possible to discuss the

597
01:20:42,287 --> 01:20:45,324
legality of an aggression, violence,

598
01:20:45,527 --> 01:20:48,564
an act of vandalism
towards a person.

599
01:20:48,727 --> 01:20:51,480
We should not give up.

600
01:20:51,647 --> 01:20:53,638
This is a sacrosanct battle

601
01:20:53,967 --> 01:20:57,926
against anything that
offends our dignity,

602
01:20:58,287 --> 01:21:00,881
not only as an author,
but as a human being.

603
01:21:01,047 --> 01:21:04,835
Just one verdict of a loyal,
brave and honest

604
01:21:05,007 --> 01:21:08,602
judge who said that even
if an author was willing,

605
01:21:09,167 --> 01:21:12,045
he'd commit an illicit
act because the art work

606
01:21:13,567 --> 01:21:16,684
has a life of its own,
like any person

607
01:21:16,887 --> 01:21:20,402
who has his or her
own character

608
01:21:21,207 --> 01:21:22,765
and personality.

609
01:21:23,407 --> 01:21:27,241
Even if the author were willing,
he'd be going

610
01:21:27,567 --> 01:21:31,003
against the respect for
something that can't be altered.

611
01:21:31,167 --> 01:21:34,557
To interrupt a film,

612
01:21:34,767 --> 01:21:36,723
mortify it, massacre it

613
01:21:37,007 --> 01:21:40,966
by altering the narrative spirit,
the pace, the sense

614
01:21:41,567 --> 01:21:45,116
with inserts of publicity
commercials is

615
01:21:45,367 --> 01:21:47,756
an act included in the penal code.

616
01:21:48,047 --> 01:21:51,483
Fellini spoke for all of us.
He was the greatest,

617
01:21:51,647 --> 01:21:53,365
renowned the world over.

618
01:21:53,527 --> 01:21:56,758
He had cast his filmmaker
author's cry

619
01:21:56,967 --> 01:21:58,958
against TV, against advertising.

620
01:21:59,127 --> 01:22:03,006
He himself,
having dared to do films

621
01:22:03,247 --> 01:22:06,683
<i>focused on these things,
Ginger & Fred, Intervista.</i>

622
01:22:06,887 --> 01:22:08,764
TV studio chaos

623
01:22:08,927 --> 01:22:11,919
was shown in its
most grotesque forms.

624
01:22:12,207 --> 01:22:13,401
Nothing has changed.

625
01:22:15,447 --> 01:22:18,757
<i>On this subject I did
The Icicle Thiefin '88.</i>

626
01:22:19,567 --> 01:22:23,526
That was a time we all
faced this problem.

627
01:22:24,607 --> 01:22:27,041
<i>The Icicle Thief
hypothesises with</i>

628
01:22:27,207 --> 01:22:30,483
the neorealist b & w
films, full of sentiment,

629
01:22:30,967 --> 01:22:33,242
interrupted by the colors of ads.

630
01:22:34,807 --> 01:22:36,206
<i>Maria! Maria!</i>

631
01:22:50,207 --> 01:22:52,277
<i>Today you don't have to give in.</i>

632
01:22:53,487 --> 01:22:55,125
<i>Demand more from
your washing machine.</i>

633
01:22:57,567 --> 01:23:00,639
<i>Enough greys, reveal
the colors of your life</i>

634
01:23:00,807 --> 01:23:02,684
<i>with powdered Vial Blu.</i>

635
01:23:03,287 --> 01:23:04,561
<i>Vial Blu appreciates it.</i>

636
01:23:09,127 --> 01:23:13,006
<i>This is not my film.
It is changed, interrupted.</i>

637
01:23:13,207 --> 01:23:16,279
All those were problems of 1988,

638
01:23:16,447 --> 01:23:18,085
this past century.

639
01:23:18,247 --> 01:23:22,081
Today we are
talking about digital,

640
01:23:22,247 --> 01:23:25,796
special effects, DVD,
technological media

641
01:23:25,967 --> 01:23:29,277
that allows seeing the film
in its most

642
01:23:31,087 --> 01:23:33,920
authentic, original essence

643
01:23:34,087 --> 01:23:38,046
as long as, when the DVD is made,
the author's format and

644
01:23:38,207 --> 01:23:41,244
sound version are respected.

645
01:23:41,447 --> 01:23:45,281
Because if the DVD is to
be made today in full color

646
01:23:45,487 --> 01:23:49,116
in 16:9 and with
Dolby Stereo 5.1,

647
01:23:49,327 --> 01:23:53,286
this denaturalises,
betrays the work of the author

648
01:23:53,487 --> 01:23:56,638
who, on the contrary,
had worked with another format

649
01:23:56,807 --> 01:23:59,685
in black and white
and monoaural sound.

650
01:23:59,847 --> 01:24:02,600
This requires a lot
of love for films.

651
01:24:02,767 --> 01:24:06,316
Love to preserve,
manage and like it,

652
01:24:06,767 --> 01:24:10,282
for the way it was shot,
and as a testimonial on how,

653
01:24:10,447 --> 01:24:14,406
with that technology, one
could express oneself artistically.

654
01:24:15,047 --> 01:24:18,278
<i>The gods are strong
and merciless.</i>

655
01:24:23,607 --> 01:24:26,644
This interruption in
the middle of a film,

656
01:24:26,887 --> 01:24:30,357
that could have set a precedent
for today's TV ads,

657
01:24:30,527 --> 01:24:34,202
is an lifelong Italian
custom in movie theatres.

658
01:24:34,367 --> 01:24:35,720
Why?

659
01:24:35,927 --> 01:24:36,643
Why?

660
01:24:37,407 --> 01:24:41,116
Because Italian movie theaters
still have this custom

661
01:24:41,287 --> 01:24:44,643
of dividing films in two parts,
leaving a space between

662
01:24:44,807 --> 01:24:46,718
the first and second parts,

663
01:24:46,927 --> 01:24:50,442
when a man walks in and says:

664
01:24:50,647 --> 01:24:54,117
"Candy, lemonade, chocolate. "

665
01:24:54,807 --> 01:24:58,766
Then the audience enters
once again and

666
01:24:59,367 --> 01:25:02,803
some have ice cream, lemonade,

667
01:25:03,047 --> 01:25:05,277
and then they wait.

668
01:25:06,047 --> 01:25:08,356
Finally the lights go out

669
01:25:08,647 --> 01:25:10,239
and the 2nd part begins.

670
01:25:11,327 --> 01:25:15,002
This custom also entails
serious problems,

671
01:25:15,967 --> 01:25:19,846
like wanting to have
high narrative stress.

672
01:25:20,487 --> 01:25:24,036
In other words,
to end the first part

673
01:25:24,447 --> 01:25:27,837
and leave the audience
with a desire

674
01:25:28,127 --> 01:25:31,642
to see the second.
And in some theatres,

675
01:25:32,007 --> 01:25:35,795
they even screen ads between
the first and second parts.

676
01:25:36,207 --> 01:25:38,960
The screen goes
to someone selling

677
01:25:39,407 --> 01:25:41,125
toilet paper,

678
01:25:41,807 --> 01:25:45,561
someone else selling
cars, refrigerators.

679
01:25:46,127 --> 01:25:50,086
You can't go any
further than that.

680
01:25:50,567 --> 01:25:54,355
Montaldo's right. Dividing into
two parts is an Italian custom.

681
01:25:54,527 --> 01:25:57,564
When we Italians write the script

682
01:25:57,767 --> 01:26:00,361
we're thinking of
the 1st and 2nd parts.

683
01:26:00,527 --> 01:26:04,076
And we divide the film
into 2 different parts.

684
01:26:04,327 --> 01:26:07,046
A foreign author can't do that.

685
01:26:07,207 --> 01:26:11,086
He doesn't know this bad custom
still exists in Italy.

686
01:26:11,527 --> 01:26:15,406
I imagine he would not like
to discover that in Italy

687
01:26:15,607 --> 01:26:18,485
his film is split in two

688
01:26:18,647 --> 01:26:21,036
in a rather uncalled for way

689
01:26:21,207 --> 01:26:23,721
by someone who
is not the director.

690
01:26:24,087 --> 01:26:27,079
But the problem,
I call it the drama,

691
01:26:27,247 --> 01:26:30,080
continues when the film
is shown on TV.

692
01:26:30,647 --> 01:26:33,878
The interruptions aren't
after the 1st and 2nd parts,

693
01:26:34,167 --> 01:26:38,046
as foreseen by the poor author,

694
01:26:38,447 --> 01:26:42,326
but are arbitrary interruptions.

695
01:26:42,487 --> 01:26:46,082
At a given time,
the most harrowing moment,

696
01:26:46,247 --> 01:26:50,206
when the story is captivating,

697
01:26:51,327 --> 01:26:54,717
someone sells furniture,

698
01:26:54,927 --> 01:26:57,282
everything, and then

699
01:26:58,047 --> 01:26:59,685
the film is resumed.

700
01:27:00,367 --> 01:27:04,280
Many people are used to this.
They get up or leave,

701
01:27:04,607 --> 01:27:07,201
and return when
the film begins again.

702
01:27:07,407 --> 01:27:10,205
In summary,
it even gets to the point where,

703
01:27:10,367 --> 01:27:12,198
halfway through a film,

704
01:27:12,687 --> 01:27:16,600
we see a newsreel on
the weather for tomorrow,

705
01:27:16,847 --> 01:27:19,998
talking about China,
about the Pope's trips,

706
01:27:20,167 --> 01:27:21,600
about Berlusconi.

707
01:27:22,047 --> 01:27:25,960
I say, don't interrupt...

708
01:27:26,207 --> 01:27:28,482
as our old slogan says.

709
01:27:28,647 --> 01:27:31,366
So why interrupt the emotion,

710
01:27:31,567 --> 01:27:34,764
why should the poor
audience be forced

711
01:27:35,447 --> 01:27:38,723
to be present at
a public auction,

712
01:27:38,887 --> 01:27:41,082
with sales and sales
in advance, while

713
01:27:41,607 --> 01:27:44,246
we have tried to tell a story

714
01:27:44,567 --> 01:27:47,525
created with passion, with love,

715
01:27:47,727 --> 01:27:49,604
to entertain and move people,

716
01:27:50,447 --> 01:27:52,483
to be loved by the audience and

717
01:27:53,007 --> 01:27:54,884
because the audience loves films.

718
01:27:55,047 --> 01:27:58,084
It's not just cinema,
it's an image market.

719
01:27:58,767 --> 01:28:00,644
I don't know

720
01:28:01,127 --> 01:28:04,517
the situation in Italy.

721
01:28:04,807 --> 01:28:08,038
But I can say for sure

722
01:28:08,967 --> 01:28:12,926
that the situation in India
is not any better.

723
01:28:15,127 --> 01:28:19,086
Because very often
one gets the feeling that

724
01:28:20,567 --> 01:28:24,401
films are shown on television
as an excuse to display the ads.

725
01:28:25,367 --> 01:28:26,766
Interrupting

726
01:28:27,287 --> 01:28:30,404
the showing of the films,

727
01:28:30,647 --> 01:28:34,560
the ads keep intruding,

728
01:28:35,767 --> 01:28:37,883
and this is a real crime.

729
01:28:38,847 --> 01:28:42,806
On film people,

730
01:28:43,767 --> 01:28:47,282
particularly

731
01:28:47,447 --> 01:28:50,325
directors, hardly complain

732
01:28:50,647 --> 01:28:53,480
about these violations.

733
01:28:55,167 --> 01:28:59,126
I have heard about

734
01:28:59,887 --> 01:29:03,721
the Berne Treaty,

735
01:29:04,047 --> 01:29:06,356
the declaration on

736
01:29:06,727 --> 01:29:10,083
filmmakers' Creative Rights.

737
01:29:10,927 --> 01:29:14,886
But I cannot be sure on

738
01:29:15,687 --> 01:29:19,077
how many film people

739
01:29:20,047 --> 01:29:22,197
back home

740
01:29:23,167 --> 01:29:24,839
are aware of it.

741
01:29:25,887 --> 01:29:28,196
However, they hardly
question the situation.

742
01:29:29,927 --> 01:29:33,203
They seem to be resigned
to the bad predicament,

743
01:29:33,367 --> 01:29:36,086
as if they have no
solution to after.

744
01:29:36,327 --> 01:29:40,286
There is a strange silence
over there.

745
01:30:30,247 --> 01:30:33,603
I'll tell you how happy
I was when

746
01:30:33,767 --> 01:30:36,042
the Swedish channel TV 4

747
01:30:36,767 --> 01:30:39,964
wanted to screen my
latest film

748
01:30:40,127 --> 01:30:43,244
and in primetime.

749
01:30:44,887 --> 01:30:48,846
But they often change
the film format

750
01:30:49,407 --> 01:30:51,682
for TV screenings.

751
01:30:51,847 --> 01:30:55,760
So I asked, and they were
going to use the correct format.

752
01:30:56,047 --> 01:30:57,844
But guess what they did!

753
01:30:58,167 --> 01:31:00,840
There I was, watching my film

754
01:31:01,327 --> 01:31:05,036
when a terrible amount of
ads appeared suddenly,

755
01:31:05,287 --> 01:31:07,243
cutting the film off.

756
01:31:07,407 --> 01:31:11,286
That had never happened before,
and it's very strange

757
01:31:11,767 --> 01:31:15,726
because Sweden is a
country in which

758
01:31:16,447 --> 01:31:18,881
we have struggled for decades

759
01:31:19,047 --> 01:31:21,038
against seeing ads on TV.

760
01:31:23,047 --> 01:31:26,084
How could they include commercials?

761
01:31:26,287 --> 01:31:29,438
Parliament had changed
the laws on TV

762
01:31:29,847 --> 01:31:32,566
and so TV 4 though:

763
01:31:33,127 --> 01:31:35,004
"Let's include commercials. "

764
01:31:35,847 --> 01:31:38,680
I spoke to colleagues who were

765
01:31:38,967 --> 01:31:40,195
in shock.

766
01:31:40,527 --> 01:31:44,486
A colleague, Claes Eriksson,

767
01:31:44,647 --> 01:31:48,196
had also been ill-treated
by TV 4.

768
01:31:49,127 --> 01:31:53,086
So we got together and
talked about going to trial

769
01:31:53,887 --> 01:31:57,800
with this idea and to declare

770
01:31:58,007 --> 01:32:01,886
that our rights as authors
had been infringed.

771
01:32:02,527 --> 01:32:04,643
You can't do that with our films!

772
01:32:05,807 --> 01:32:09,243
But then I realised
you need an important

773
01:32:09,447 --> 01:32:13,281
amount of money if you
get into lawsuits.

774
01:32:13,767 --> 01:32:17,043
If not, everything
could go to pot,

775
01:32:17,327 --> 01:32:20,603
you could be declared guilty
and have to pay

776
01:32:20,807 --> 01:32:22,559
damages to the other party.

777
01:32:22,967 --> 01:32:25,959
But we have very harsh
organisations.

778
01:32:26,807 --> 01:32:29,116
The Swedish Playwrights' Guild,

779
01:32:29,327 --> 01:32:33,240
the Theatre Guild,
the Journalists' Guild.

780
01:32:34,447 --> 01:32:37,245
A series of guilds backed

781
01:32:37,407 --> 01:32:39,318
Claes Eriksson and me up.

782
01:32:40,567 --> 01:32:44,480
They got a million,
no, half a million,

783
01:32:45,047 --> 01:32:48,562
to help us get ahead

784
01:32:48,847 --> 01:32:50,917
with our legal action.

785
01:32:51,967 --> 01:32:54,322
And the moment is coming soon.

786
01:32:54,647 --> 01:32:56,922
We'll go to the court of Stockholm

787
01:32:57,087 --> 01:33:00,318
and will then confirm our stance,
saying that

788
01:33:00,567 --> 01:33:04,526
they cannot do this with

789
01:33:04,727 --> 01:33:06,240
our films.

790
01:33:06,447 --> 01:33:09,883
They cannot crush them,
tear them apart

791
01:33:10,047 --> 01:33:12,163
with a bunch of commercials.

792
01:33:12,967 --> 01:33:16,243
That infringes our rights

793
01:33:16,847 --> 01:33:18,200
as authors.

794
01:33:19,447 --> 01:33:23,042
Now is the time to see whether

795
01:33:23,207 --> 01:33:25,516
we can beat TV 4.

796
01:33:26,407 --> 01:33:30,366
We are prepared, with money,
reasoning,

797
01:33:30,647 --> 01:33:32,046
and we are going to attack!

798
01:33:38,447 --> 01:33:42,360
<i>Once Snows of Kilimanjaro
is over</i>

799
01:33:42,607 --> 01:33:46,520
we will offer you the World
Mus Card Game Championship

800
01:33:46,767 --> 01:33:50,203
in wich the Spaniard
Juan Carlos Rentero

801
01:33:50,407 --> 01:33:54,195
cannot play due
to a sudden illness.

802
01:33:58,047 --> 01:34:01,005
In face of so many atrocities,
manipulation,

803
01:34:01,207 --> 01:34:04,995
alterations, as we have seen
and will keep on seeing,

804
01:34:05,167 --> 01:34:06,759
our only defence is

805
01:34:06,927 --> 01:34:09,521
exercising our protest.

806
01:34:09,727 --> 01:34:11,843
Our fury as cheated spectators

807
01:34:12,007 --> 01:34:14,441
should make the tycoons'
structures shudder

808
01:34:14,647 --> 01:34:18,196
but we haven't made this film
for the audience rights,

809
01:34:18,367 --> 01:34:21,086
but for the authors,
for the filmmakers.

810
01:34:21,247 --> 01:34:24,398
We must protect the past,
thinking of the future.

811
01:34:25,247 --> 01:34:28,683
To end this first film,
a quote from an immortal film.

812
01:34:29,047 --> 01:34:30,924
The voice of Howard Roark.

813
01:35:02,367 --> 01:35:04,119
Saying they think of us...

814
01:35:04,287 --> 01:35:06,926
Tycoons just think of
making money with us.

815
01:35:07,167 --> 01:35:08,919
Thinking of their films,

816
01:35:09,087 --> 01:35:11,681
filmmakers work for us.

817
01:35:12,847 --> 01:35:14,678
In our next film,

818
01:35:14,927 --> 01:35:17,964
John Huston and Sydney Pollack's
defence of Moral Rights

819
01:35:18,127 --> 01:35:19,799
in the courts of Paris
and Copenhagen.

820
01:35:20,047 --> 01:35:22,402
We won precisely because
it seemed impossible.

821
01:35:22,647 --> 01:35:25,525
Deterioration of color
as per Martin Scorsese.

822
01:35:31,887 --> 01:35:35,004
The eternal problem of dubbing
and altering music.

823
01:35:35,327 --> 01:35:37,716
I remember Godard telling me:

824
01:35:37,927 --> 01:35:40,805
"In Italy you don't know
about spoken films.

825
01:35:40,967 --> 01:35:42,639
In Italy you
know about dubbed films. "

826
01:35:44,687 --> 01:35:47,155
The Final Cut
and the new vandalism

827
01:35:47,327 --> 01:35:49,966
of software system companies
such as Movie Mask.

828
01:36:02,927 --> 01:36:05,282
With the participation of...
