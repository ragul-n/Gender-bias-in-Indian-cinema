1
00:02:57,978 --> 00:03:03,439
BELIEVE IT OR NOT

2
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,895
Everything will go
according to plan

3
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:24,527
Vincent knows to keep a promise
and get things done

4
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:27,400
Pull the car over if you see a store

5
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,601
-Why?
-1 want to buy some butter

6
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,474
Butter?

7
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:34,809
That's what I have with drinks
to avoid choking

8
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:38,213
- [driver] Is he Lord Krishna?
-1 need a bunch of bananas too

9
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:42,720
Pass me that water

10
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,692
Open the lid, man

11
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:53,259
- Pull the car over here
-Why?

12
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,300
I need to pee

13
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,494
You can pee when we stop
at the store

14
00:03:57,671 --> 00:03:59,662
You don't decide when I pee
Ido

15
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:01,207
Stop the car right now

16
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,816
0 God, somebody is following us

17
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:13,219
Could it be those people?

18
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:15,822
Anoop, I think we're in trouble
Go faster

19
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:17,651
Lord, what if it's president

20
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,783
- Drive faster
- Hurry up

21
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,223
Go faster

22
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:22,294
It's them for sure

23
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:23,396
Anoop, hurry

24
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:26,660
- I think someone gave us out
- Our plan has to succeed at any cost

25
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,030
It's right behind
go faster

26
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:31,463
Turn left

27
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:32,697
Anoop, take that route

28
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:34,831
(passengers shout at once)

29
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,678
- They're gone
- We're safe (sighs)

30
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:40,639
That was someone else

31
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:41,908
Who asked you to stop here?

32
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:44,676
I can't drive as you wish
There's a ravine ahead

33
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:51,722
Give me some water

34
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,372
There's nobody around
Didn't you inform them?

35
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,602
Don't worry
Annamma has coordinated it all

36
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,609
This looks like a haunted house to me

37
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:14,373
It's only until the no-confidence
This is a safe place

38
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:17,007
You'll be gone
I've to stay here

39
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,951
- [woman on phone] Anoop?
- [Anoop] Yes, sister

40
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,748
- [Anoop] We're here
- [woman on phone] Okay

41
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:24,550
- [woman on phone] Don't stay long
- [Anoop] Okay, sister

42
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:28,985
(door opens)

43
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:30,688
There

44
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:36,096
- He's the guy
- Hello

45
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:40,771
Come on

46
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,668
Okay, then

47
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:46,639
-Just one man
- One man

48
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:49,404
Give me a minute

49
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,041
Bring my bag over, man

50
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:54,686
- Anoop, bring the bag
- Forgot my bag

51
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:57,689
- So do you drink?
-No

52
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,620
That's a relief
Here, give it to me

53
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:07,392
- He's a real pain
- But we've to work it out

54
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:10,101
- Do you live alone?
-1 don't like questions

55
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:12,462
No questions then
just answers

56
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:45,672
Hello

57
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,600
Yes, I'll be there

58
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:51,974
Is he safe?

59
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:53,909
I've told him about it all

60
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:56,072
Should we move him
to a different resort?

61
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:59,081
No, that's the trend
these days

62
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,751
But be careful
he left them to join us

63
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:05,385
Such rats can never be trusted

64
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:07,627
Okay, I'll be there soon

65
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:10,392
Anoop, we've to hurry

66
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:16,393
Ratheesh?

67
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,001
Pull it

68
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,003
Hurry up

69
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:22,066
Pull harder

70
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,135
Faster

71
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,845
Be careful with the side plank

72
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:30,807
Are you fixing a boat?

73
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,749
Don't you see the rod drilling in?

74
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:35,451
What's this?

75
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:37,853
When it comes to work
there's no place like Gulf

76
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:40,722
- It's fully air-conditioned
- Can we make good money?

77
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,124
Good money?

78
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:45,221
You know Rupeesl there is Rupees115 here

79
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:46,488
Is that so?

80
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:48,067
They pay like the English do

81
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,169
You've to see the minaret
of mosques there

82
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,563
Its base'll be

83
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:55,039
10 to 30 times this house

84
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:56,768
As you go higher

85
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,112
the top part will
be like a nest

86
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,576
Hey you

87
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,206
That's a mosque
This is George's house

88
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,749
That's enough hot air
for the day

89
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:08,512
If you say anything more
even the concrete will melt

90
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:10,111
Do something useful, Raveendra

91
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:12,657
He was in the Gulf
for hardly a year

92
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:15,694
but this story has been on
for two years

93
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:18,264
(everybody laughs)

94
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:22,058
These idiots are so careless

95
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:23,795
Cement

96
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:25,663
George brother

97
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:28,697
Gopi, what's this?

98
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:30,936
- The price's up
- Up by Rupee3 again?

99
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,841
- Then how will I --
- How many bags?

100
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,607
- 35 bags
- Carry them inside, it might rain

101
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,251
Vinod, set up some planks

102
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:41,486
We've to keep cement inside

103
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:43,147
Supervisor
order a load of metal

104
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,155
We're running out of metal

105
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,622
George

106
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,717
Take your hands off
I won't let it go

107
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,262
Here comes trouble

108
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:52,228
- (clears throat) George?
-Yes?

109
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:54,528
I don't envy you
building a big house

110
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,168
Dust and dirt from your site

111
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,066
has made a mess of my home

112
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,729
Did I complain?
No

113
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:00,931
But this is unacceptable

114
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:02,098
Ramesh, tell me

115
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:03,539
What did I do?

116
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:05,975
No father
I need an answer

117
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:07,739
Come to the point
Ramesha

118
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:09,747
Since you started work
on the second storey

119
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:11,783
My wife can't
prepare fish

120
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:14,285
wash clothes or tidy up the yard

121
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,022
Did a plank fall
on her head?

122
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:17,749
I wish it'd been so

123
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:19,689
Women can't step outside

124
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:22,160
Your workers ogle
whistle, catcall

125
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:23,820
1 didn't complain

126
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:25,522
But this time
it's different

127
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:27,327
This one is in class 12th

128
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,095
When she stepped out today

129
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,964
she heard a song from above

130
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:32,628
Afoul song

131
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:33,763
What song?

132
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,238
"My flower, when I don't see you..."

133
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:36,968
Now how's that for a song?

134
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,635
I'll screw him up

135
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,645
Ramesha, we'll solve the case

136
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,010
When did he sing?

137
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,741
I came to know
when I returned

138
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,318
Whoever it is
I'll punch his face

139
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,746
I'm not an easy man

140
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:49,322
Supervisor Rajan
where are you?

141
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,124
- There he's
- Ask the workers to come down

142
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,748
- Call them
- Karuppaayi?

143
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,157
Ask everyone to come down

144
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:57,093
Call the electricians also

145
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,164
I said everyone
What is special about them?

146
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:00,596
Call them

147
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,997
Whoever insulted
my daughter

148
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:04,103
1 won't allow him to
work here

149
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:05,567
This man is insane

150
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:07,299
Father, please let's
I told you to —-

151
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:08,670
Neighbours are watching

152
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,675
Why're you here?
Go back home

153
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,109
I want to see if decent people
have a place here

154
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:15,375
Who sang that vicious song

155
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:17,616
to this little girl?

156
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:19,748
You'll leave after work

157
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:20,979
I've to live here all my life

158
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,782
As itis, they're
jealous of me

159
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:24,583
George, it's not about jealousy

160
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:26,056
Ramesh, panchayat
received a complaint

161
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:27,819
to stay construction
of my house

162
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,622
Did I say it were you?

163
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:30,753
But it wasn't me

164
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:31,922
- Did I say so?
-No

165
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:33,760
We have to find the singer
Did you see him?

166
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:34,857
No, I heard him

167
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,765
When I looked up
he moved away

168
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,304
You heard her

169
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:40,300
Who sings around here?

170
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:42,273
Then maybe it was an angel

171
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:45,341
Nobody works until
we find the singer

172
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:47,709
We've no problem
Your housewarming'll be delayed

173
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:48,747
(George stutters)

174
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,282
Be honest
tell me who did

175
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:51,316
There's no point asking

176
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,010
A good whack
oh tummy will do

177
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,882
He'll sing and pee in one tune

178
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,284
And do you think
we'll be quiet?

179
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,414
Just try hitting one of us

180
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,952
We don't earn money
as lookouts

181
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:02,721
These are the hands
of a hardworking man

182
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:03,762
Come on
we'll see

183
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,695
Come on, come here
(men argue)

184
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:06,989
First things first

185
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,157
Give one tight slap

186
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:09,632
The singer won't admit to it

187
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:10,760
Ask them to sing

188
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:11,962
Let the girl hear it

189
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:13,402
She'll decide the singer

190
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,308
Shall we ask them
to sing, Ramesha?

191
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:16,637
Let them sing

192
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:17,767
Karuppaayi, you first

193
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:18,935
Me?

194
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:20,910
Men his age are
troublemakers

195
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,376
Karuppaayi, sing

196
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:24,109
Which song?
"My flower..."

197
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:28,885
"My flower
where's your nest?"

198
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,080
What next?

199
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:31,349
"When I don't see you"

200
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,084
"Then the fledglings will cry"

201
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:34,691
What song is this?

202
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,387
You heard him sing

203
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:37,861
(girl nods)

204
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,726
It's not Karuppaayi
the girl said so

205
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:41,129
Thaamara
your turn

206
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:43,265
(Thaamara spits)

207
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:45,100
"My flower"

208
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:47,772
This is how I sing flowers
Do you want to hear more?

209
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:48,898
Do you, child?

210
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,100
No

211
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:51,335
So it's not Thaamara

212
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:52,434
-No
-No?

213
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:53,679
No

214
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,747
Now let's hear you

215
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:57,077
"My flower
when I don't see you"

216
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,717
Is it him?

217
00:11:58,818 --> 00:11:59,785
No

218
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:00,876
"I don't see the colours"

219
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,317
You want the Bengali to sing?

220
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:03,719
I don't trust anybody

221
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,382
Come, sing (foreign language)

222
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:07,453
"My... flower -"

223
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,388
That's enough (foreign language)

224
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:11,126
Next up is Vinod

225
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:13,898
(various people singing)

226
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:22,866
No, father

227
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:24,340
Ramesha, we're done

228
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:25,878
There is nobody
left to sing --

229
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:27,480
Suni brother didn't sing

230
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,146
There're more people
behind the scene

231
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:30,306
Call him down

232
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,440
Where is he?

233
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:32,916
He stepped out
for a smoke

234
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:34,349
So you're hiding him?

235
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:35,721
Supervisor?

236
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:37,187
I'll call him right away

237
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:39,916
Father, let's go now

238
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:40,958
Be quiet

239
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,528
What's taking so long?

240
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:44,428
Are you smoking a chimney?

241
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,759
Come back soon

242
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:46,957
He's coming

243
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,501
Your smoke will set me
off to heaven

244
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:52,103
Others go back to work

245
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:53,930
You start unloading

246
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:55,299
We'll wait

247
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:57,172
Let the case be solved

248
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,778
Okay, let it be

249
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:01,143
Okay

250
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:03,178
What happened?

251
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:07,419
Sing the song
"My flower"

252
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,045
What?

253
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:11,421
You were playing a game?

254
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:12,753
I thought --

255
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:14,293
Just sing that song

256
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:15,792
All of a sudden?

257
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:17,192
Sing the song, man

258
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:19,759
Why not after work,
when I've had a shower?

259
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:21,197
Let's decide that later

260
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:22,893
As for now
you'd better sing

261
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:24,094
Are you threatening me?

262
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:26,433
Give your orders
inyour palace

263
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,064
Supervisor, he's testing
my patience

264
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:29,333
Sunil, just sing

265
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:30,500
What is this --

266
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,374
It's a serious matter

267
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,445
Which song?

268
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,071
"My flower"

269
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:36,511
"My flower"

270
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:38,778
Not that flower
the one in "Premam™

271
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:39,975
That flower

272
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,781
"My flower
when I don't see you"

273
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,381
Is this the guy?

274
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,457
It's not this uncle

275
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:46,582
Not uncle
Brother

276
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:47,951
Okay, it's not him

277
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:48,993
Are you happy now?

278
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,459
Now go home
with the child

279
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,088
I shouldn't see you
stepping out again

280
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:53,960
Please return to work

281
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:56,903
Do you need special request
to return to work?

282
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:59,203
What about you
George?

283
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,300
My dear Ramesha

284
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:02,897
I'll find it out soon

285
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,066
Very soon

286
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,336
What's the matter?

287
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:07,174
Get back to work now

288
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:08,537
I like old songs better

289
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:10,309
My housewarming is on 10th

290
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,884
We'll do it

291
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,519
Focus on your work

292
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:17,385
Don't fool around

293
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:20,048
If I hear anybody singing

294
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,287
I'll shove this
down his throat

295
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:24,159
He ran away with the girl
from his workplace

296
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:25,856
and trapped his coworkers

297
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:27,159
True, I lured her away

298
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,132
but I treat her
like a princess

299
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:31,464
That was the only place,
you came to work everyday

300
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:34,006
He came but don't say
that he worked

301
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,437
(everybody laughs)

302
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,206
Stop gazing at the sky

303
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:38,936
Pass me that cord
white dwarf

304
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:40,136
When you can't beat Malayalis

305
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,610
fight Bengalis

306
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,009
Suni brother taunts him
all the time

307
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,515
That's because
he's a poor chap

308
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:46,585
Do your job, Kocha

309
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:48,415
They pay cash
not carrots

310
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:50,316
He's offended
(laughs)

311
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:51,447
Yes, I'm

312
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,355
Move the block over here

313
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:57,586
Shanavas, fetch the lever

314
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,032
Lay it straight

315
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:01,357
Knock it right there

316
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:02,935
Lift it up

317
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:05,304
I'm trusting you guys

318
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,305
1 didn't book
a catering group

319
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,034
Don't worry Rajan brother
we'll manage

320
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:10,301
[Rajan] Be there early

321
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,435
My music show will be
the day's highlight

322
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:14,237
I've done my best

323
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,870
I heard that
your last show bombed

324
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:17,449
- Who said that?
- [Suni] Everybody knows

325
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,642
Why're you sitting apart?

326
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,079
Show was a big hit

327
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:21,584
He brought special food
that's why

328
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:24,281
It's just cabbage
and dried fish

329
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:26,514
(Vinod hums a song)

330
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:29,456
Why're you scared of father?

331
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,627
It's so dusty

332
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:34,928
Send me a photo
in your new churidhar

333
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,467
(humming continues)

334
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,197
Make it fast, dear

335
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:42,097
Get out

336
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:43,606
It's my mother
from home

337
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:51,012
George, did you notice this?

338
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,049
What?

339
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:53,175
Look here

340
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:54,616
Come closer

341
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,947
This pillar conceals
that doorframe

342
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,455
That's what I said

343
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,625
It's only a grain's length

344
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,153
Grain or yarn

345
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:05,423
measures can't change

346
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,329
Vastushastra is a science

347
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,458
Pillechaa, I don't believe
in vasthu

348
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:10,730
(man screams)

349
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:12,061
Oh, somebody fell down

350
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:13,172
It's Sujith

351
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,070
I told you so
You've evil tongue

352
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,937
Sujith?
Move aside

353
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:18,635
Lift him up

354
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:20,303
How did he fall?

355
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,039
(all talking at once)

356
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:23,945
[Karuppaayi] Suni, call an ambulance

357
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,380
[Suni] Okay

358
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:29,655
Sulfi, Sujith had
an accident

359
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,985
Come to the site
with your vehicle

360
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:40,728
Slowly

361
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:43,198
You open the door

362
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:47,638
Get him in

363
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,707
Come on, quick

364
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:49,998
Don't hang around there

365
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:51,337
You're leaving work midway

366
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:52,377
Make do with this money

367
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:53,968
And come back soon

368
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:55,137
Open up

369
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:57,375
This's no ambulance
Get onto the back

370
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:59,008
But you ride like an ambulance

371
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:00,141
Get onto the back

372
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:01,219
Who called this cart?

373
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,789
Couldn't get a Benz car
Who else do call?

374
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:05,520
Go fast

375
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:10,220
Blood is a good omen
when you start something new

376
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:12,089
Then why not kill someone?

377
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,135
1 think it's the evil eye

378
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:19,096
Let's fix an ash gourd
on the rooftop

379
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:20,603
Yes, that can be done

380
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:22,470
Okay

381
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:24,110
You see that?
What?

382
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:26,072
It's the power of vasthu

383
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,078
Pillechaa, these fools took
two weeks

384
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:29,511
and whole a load
of cement and rod

385
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:30,707
to complete this

386
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,147
You want me to knock them down?

387
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:34,310
It's your house
do as you like

388
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:37,316
Maybe you'll learn a lesson
when everything falls apart

389
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,193
- Supervisor
-Yes?

390
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:43,818
Knock down these pillars

391
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,529
Vasthu cannot be ignored

392
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:47,793
Shall we knock it down?

393
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,067
Why not?

394
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:50,498
Done

395
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:51,794
Name?

396
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:53,401
Sujith

397
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:55,232
Age?

398
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:57,098
Around 24

399
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:58,210
Place?

400
00:17:58,344 --> 00:17:59,641
Kaalavayal

401
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:01,213
Give Rupee5

402
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:05,307
Oh?

403
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:06,852
Vomiting or sickness?

404
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:08,450
Not today

405
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:11,755
Who was with you
when you fell?

406
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,455
Who helped you
get to your feet?

407
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,756
There were many of us
at the worksite

408
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:19,829
Try to remember

409
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,557
Do you remember
who was with you?

410
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:24,363
Who helped you up?

411
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,260
We were all downstairs

412
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:28,373
Some electricians were around

413
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:30,202
If you want their names

414
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:32,209
Kamal, Ebin, Sainu...

415
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:34,637
George, the house owner
was also there

416
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,143
He has had a hard knock
on his head

417
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,615
I want to check if he can
recall everything

418
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:41,619
Why do you answer for him?

419
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:42,854
Go and wait outside

420
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:44,122
Me?

421
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:45,189
Yes, you, get out

422
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:46,621
Go Man

423
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:49,218
Stop playing with phone

424
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:50,454
Hand it over to him

425
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:51,530
Goon

426
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,099
Give that to me

427
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,425
This is going to take time

428
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:56,501
Don't wait for us

429
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:58,900
You leave after work

430
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,173
(grins)

431
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,673
Do you see this?

432
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:05,710
(grins) That's too many kisses

433
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:07,313
He's smart

434
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:10,176
Here he is

435
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:14,785
Carpenter Soman sent four kisses first

436
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,445
then a thousand later

437
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:17,545
Is that so?

438
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,216
What's wrong with you?

439
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:22,555
I understand when married men
use false names on phone

440
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,152
My mother checks my phone

441
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:26,731
Did Soman sent those kisses
to your mother?

442
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:28,434
Get an X-ray

443
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:30,228
Make sure the patient
doesn't walk too much

444
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:31,268
You wait here

445
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:33,338
I'll get the X-ray done

446
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:34,838
It's the patient
who needs X-ray

447
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:36,135
Oh, you're right

448
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:37,572
Suni brother?

449
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,446
Aren't you done dressing up?

450
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:51,682
I'm ready
You please hurry up

451
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,623
-We're late
- I'll be ready in a jiffy

452
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:55,194
Just a minute

453
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:57,520
You're playing on the phone?

454
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,655
Your friends are waiting for you

455
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:01,663
Hey, is that what
you're wearing?

456
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,496
I've pressed a good dhoti-shirt
for you

457
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:04,865
I've got work to do there

458
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:06,335
They will be spoiled
in no time

459
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:07,838
Why do you do this?
This'll do

460
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:10,465
The sky seems to bloom

461
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:14,612
When you have frangipanis in your hair

462
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,976
When the silver cloud veil

463
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:19,411
Lifts

464
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:21,552
The crimson sky

465
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:23,748
Looks down and smiles

466
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,586
My beloved

467
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:30,654
When gems and jewels glint on you

468
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:36,233
You are to me a star-spangled lotus

469
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:40,269
(whacky lyrics begins)

470
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:53,644
(whacky lyrics ends)

471
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:57,451
The sky seems to bloom

472
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:00,658
When you have frangipanis in your hair

473
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:05,329
The sky seems to bloom

474
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:08,566
When you have frangipanis in your hair

475
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,377
Pitter-patter rains, bitter winds

476
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:28,579
Trembling grounds, it's monsoon peak

477
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:30,587
The minnows waddle into the fields

478
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:32,714
Mistaking them for their homes

479
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:34,383
One, two, three, four pots

480
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:36,359
Count up the nightly malts

481
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:37,860
Crush onions, chilly, ginger

482
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,261
And have it in greasy parts

483
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:43,327
When the day's work is done

484
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:46,564
We smoke at our fave den

485
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,932
In between, we play our lil' games

486
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:53,844
Of which you better not divine

487
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,978
(folk song refrain)

488
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:13,499
Stop here

489
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:28,109
Hey you

490
00:22:29,615 --> 00:22:30,741
Stop there

491
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:31,850
I said stop

492
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:32,850
Where is my money?

493
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:34,453
Jessy, hands off

494
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:36,444
I'll give you in two days

495
00:22:37,423 --> 00:22:38,549
I've heard this before

496
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:39,886
I'll give you for sure

497
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,322
I want my money now

498
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,360
I would've come to work
after you gave the advance

499
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:44,554
Then you hired someone else

500
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,722
- So I should've waited for you?
-Yes

501
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,425
I'll return your money
when I've money

502
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:49,660
Don't play tricks on me

503
00:22:49,802 --> 00:22:50,928
Give me my money

504
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,128
No, what'll you do?

505
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:53,872
- Stop there
- Jessy

506
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,702
You nicked what I kept
to fix my leaky house

507
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:57,832
Aren't you ashamed?

508
00:22:57,943 --> 00:22:59,502
- Give my money back
- Leave him, Jessy

509
00:22:59,645 --> 00:23:01,579
I won't until he returns
my money

510
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:03,978
Go away

511
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:06,745
You'll rot in hell
You scoundrel

512
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:09,751
I'll give your money
I'll bring it to your home

513
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,789
I don't want your money
You rascal

514
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,024
Useless

515
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:14,387
If you swear again

516
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:15,688
I'll not let you live in peace

517
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:17,353
I'll knock you down

518
00:23:17,463 --> 00:23:18,828
She dares to mess with me

519
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:22,131
Move away

520
00:23:24,637 --> 00:23:25,536
Jessy

521
00:23:25,638 --> 00:23:26,935
Leave me alone

522
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:29,697
Mind your own business

523
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:31,606
I don't need help

524
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,146
What's it with Jessy?

525
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:42,548
She was the one
who started it

526
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:45,981
You pledged Geetha's gold
to return her money?

527
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:48,860
I spent it in ones and twos

528
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:50,621
I'll return it

529
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:52,622
Right now, I'm broke

530
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:56,526
You're getting worse
by the day

531
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,029
You know what she is, don't you?

532
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,873
She's shameless enough to come home
and create trouble

533
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:03,938
News'd have reached home
by now

534
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:06,808
- That's what worries me
- I'll talk to Geetha

535
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:08,647
No need of that

536
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:10,679
Don't get involved in it

537
00:24:12,051 --> 00:24:13,951
I'll go home late today

538
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:16,648
Here's some fresh fish
Take it home

539
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:17,745
No, you keep it

540
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,688
Where'll I take this?

541
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,087
Then throw it back into the river
I'm off

542
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:26,631
Suni, do you want me
to go with you?

543
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:29,501
Call me if there's any issue
I'll talk to Geetha

544
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:30,932
There's no need of that

545
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,772
(whacky lyrics begins)

546
00:24:50,189 --> 00:24:51,588
(whacky lyrics ends)

547
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,159
The sky seems to bloom

548
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:58,730
When you have frangipanis in your hair

549
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:02,199
The sky seems to bloom

550
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:06,161
When you have frangipanis in your hair

551
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:25,148
Slowly, we'll walk
to the countryside

552
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:29,559
Play cards, get broke
and go home to deride

553
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:33,299
Steal change in pots
that milady hides

554
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:36,164
And get away again
after greedily dine

555
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:40,731
Walk on the lanes
where birdies fly

556
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,109
All the way munching
tasty bite

557
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:48,046
Seeking you out
in the dark slyly

558
00:25:49,615 --> 00:25:51,242
As you giggle naively...

559
00:25:52,818 --> 00:25:55,116
(folk song refrain)

560
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,632
From plank to plank

561
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:10,600
Hit the brad
Shut the board

562
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:12,727
Hit not the knee
Hits when you tap

563
00:26:12,838 --> 00:26:15,864
Bind the rods
Hack the cords

564
00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:18,033
Raised the homes
From times of yore

565
00:26:18,844 --> 00:26:21,313
In muddy shirts
Over dusty coats

566
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:24,105
Set out the ship
With choppy oar

567
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:41,798
Come soon, rally is about to start

568
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:48,237
- Any news of that Vincent?
- No news, president. It's a gone case

569
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:50,239
Okay, whatever
Make sure our event goes well

570
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:51,342
All set

571
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,669
- Did you get the flags from party office?
- Yes, we've

572
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,770
- Ask them to come down
-I'll call them

573
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:01,982
That scotch was fake

574
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:06,986
You guys carry on
I'll come later

575
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:08,059
Why?

576
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:09,661
- How much is the mackerel?
- Rupee 150

577
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:10,785
Alright

578
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:13,160
- What about this fish?
- Half a kilo at?60, sister

579
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,766
And that one?

580
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:21,030
Where is our daughter?

581
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:22,902
She's in that shop

582
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:26,140
Here

583
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,311
?78

584
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:44,624
- [Karuppaayi] Be careful, dear
- Father, it's you

585
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,664
Come closer

586
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:49,826
- Are these biscuits?
- You didn't go for work today?

587
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:52,336
Yes, saw your mother there

588
00:27:53,372 --> 00:27:55,363
- Don't you attend dance classes?
-Yes

589
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:57,943
- Study well
- Come, let's go

590
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:02,009
Hey, give me?50

591
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:08,217
Bye

592
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:12,783
- Why don't you invite him home?
-Why can't he ask me?

593
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:15,121
I earn a fair share of income myself

594
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:19,060
AllI asked for was to drink less
not give it up altogether

595
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:20,966
Give me two more

596
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:24,001
These days money turns into sweat

597
00:28:24,136 --> 00:28:27,834
- Just how it goes, I've no idea
- Did you get something?

598
00:28:27,973 --> 00:28:31,068
- No chance
- [Thaamara] Hello, we're almost there

599
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:34,145
- We should make some quick bucks, Kocha
- Suni, can I get you a bumper?

600
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,270
We're useless without money
No, thanks

601
00:28:36,415 --> 00:28:39,316
- [Thaamara] I'm coming by bus
- So what's the plan?

602
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:42,785
I might be the first Indian man
to have been kicked out by his wife

603
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:45,880
- Then I'll be the second man
- Definitely

604
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:47,989
I need to buy something

605
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:50,220
- Annamma is the mastermind
- Now who doesn't know that?

606
00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:52,228
- Babu?
- Tomorrow is the no-confidence motion

607
00:28:52,364 --> 00:28:54,230
Let's see what happens

608
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:59,769
Sir, I've been meaning to see you

609
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:01,464
Is it about the loan?

610
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,232
Yes, please help if you can

611
00:29:04,376 --> 00:29:06,071
- Here you go, sir
- How much?

612
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,508
2160

613
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,511
Suni, I'm the society president
but mine is not the final word there

614
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:15,412
The board decides on such matters

615
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,511
I don't want you to write off the loan

616
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:21,054
- Just need some time
- You earnRupeelooo per day

617
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:25,391
If you work 25 days a month
you earn Rupees 25,000

618
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:28,831
That's enough to look after your family
and repay the loan

619
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:30,402
So your problem is not money

620
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:33,267
It's drinking
You've money for that, don't you?

621
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:35,100
Okay sir, you carry on

622
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,402
- I'll take care of it
- Okay

623
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:40,468
Karuppaayi is here

624
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:44,482
Birthday candle for seven-year-old
and a pack of vermicelli

625
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:46,142
Brother, the function is about to begin

626
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:47,753
Wait a minute

627
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:57,225
- Here, Suni
- Thank you, Babu

628
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:02,127
- Let's go, Kocha
- Okay, let's go

629
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:04,361
Tomorrow we're working at Basheer's house

630
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,164
-1'm not coming to work tomorrow
-Why not?

631
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:09,172
-It's my daughter's birthday
- You're making silly excuses

632
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:11,504
-EvenI won't be there tomorrow
- What's wrong with you?

633
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:15,069
-It's his daughter's birthday
-1'm not coming either

634
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:19,582
[Supervisor] Stop coming to work
I'll hire some good workers

635
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:22,149
- When?
- What happened?

636
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:24,153
Okay then

637
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,522
- Our Ramachandran is no more
- Who? Neremaricha Ramachandran?

638
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:29,219
- Yes, him
- Shouldn't we go then?

639
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:31,022
- Yes, we should
-I'm not going anywhere

640
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:32,096
Then what about me?

641
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:35,427
- You're still here?
-1 was waiting for you

642
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:36,797
- Take an auto and go
- Auto

643
00:30:36,902 --> 00:30:38,802
- Those people are real thugs
- Brother, please no

644
00:30:38,904 --> 00:30:40,895
You take this home
Go fast

645
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,007
- [Karuppaayi] Come along
- I'll go with you

646
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:44,973
- Thaamara?
- Go away

647
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,084
Is this the place?

648
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:04,254
Koche, this creature looks strange
He'll charge you extra

649
00:31:04,396 --> 00:31:05,420
He can't fool me

650
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,589
-How much is it?
- Rupees 25

651
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:12,567
We come this way quite often
I'll give you Rupees 30 and no more

652
00:31:16,408 --> 00:31:18,035
Has the body arrived?

653
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:20,508
No, the postmortem is tomorrow

654
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:23,148
It was already four
when he hung himself

655
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:25,045
One lemon soda

656
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:27,652
- Koche, do you want?
- No, I've a throat problem

657
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:34,849
- What was wrong with that man?

658
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,088
An astrologer had predicted
that he'll die at 40

659
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:39,960
That Surendran of Jalajalayam

660
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:42,430
He turned 40 today
so he killed himself

661
00:31:42,534 --> 00:31:44,195
That's all

662
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:46,531
- He could've waited a little more
- What for?

663
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:48,868
He could've easily conned the astrologer

664
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:53,005
Last night, he came here after work
and sat right there

665
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:55,512
He bought a soda before he left

666
00:31:55,614 --> 00:31:58,584
Today, he's in a coffin
That's the fate of man

667
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,354
- Koche, have some
- No, thanks

668
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:10,084
- Thaamara, here's your soda
-But I didn't ask for it

669
00:32:10,462 --> 00:32:12,453
- Pay the bill
- Thank you

670
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:16,193
- Whose death were you talking about?
- Your aunt's

671
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:23,671
When he was alive
he was always late to work

672
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,001
Now we've to wait for him in his death

673
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:28,245
We've seen his body
when he was alive

674
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,041
It's the same but just a dead one

675
00:32:30,182 --> 00:32:33,174
Anyway, let's go and say hello
We can't come tomorrow

676
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:35,082
Whose body are you taking about?

677
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,517
Your uncle's

678
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:39,218
That's good
First my aunt, now my uncle

679
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:40,518
Next you'll say it's mine

680
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,992
There's no need of firewood
We'll use gas

681
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:44,926
We can get the job done in two hours

682
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:46,394
Suni?

683
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:49,432
That is Ramachandran's brother

684
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,694
-1'm leaving now
-It's his brother

685
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,530
Anyway, we've to wait till noon

686
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,198
I'll make the call

687
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:58,605
- We just need two cylinders
- That's enough for the rites?

688
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,200
Of course

689
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:02,473
So the funeral will be held tomorrow?

690
00:33:03,248 --> 00:33:06,115
We just came to know about it
We were at the worksite

691
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:08,285
He never shared anything with me

692
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:11,422
It's all a game of fate
That's it

693
00:33:11,523 --> 00:33:13,184
His time had come

694
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:16,689
He had borrowed Rupees 80 from me
two days ago

695
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:20,328
We've set everything in the backyard
Please help yourself

696
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:23,295
-We only have rum
-No problem

697
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:25,967
Okay

698
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,975
- [Karuppaayi] But we'd rum today?
- [Suni] That was scotch

699
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:34,010
We have our glasses with us

700
00:33:34,246 --> 00:33:36,214
- Here, give me
- (a man mumbles)

701
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:37,679
Hey, hey

702
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:39,307
Give me more

703
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:44,145
- Have water
- Please, I can't have it with water

704
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:52,124
To speak the truth
he shouldn't have died

705
00:33:52,264 --> 00:33:54,733
- You're right
- It's that astrologers fault

706
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:57,996
- We've to teach him a lesson
- Yes, we should

707
00:33:58,136 --> 00:34:00,298
That rascal should be --
I daren't say anything more

708
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:02,100
I'll be very honest here

709
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,605
That's in my nature

710
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:08,238
He foiled my wedding plans
because I didn't work for him

711
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:11,509
It's not such a bad thing
There, there, stop crying

712
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:13,106
- Hey, stop it
- Somebody's coming

713
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:15,083
Let's go to his place now

714
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:18,453
Hello

715
00:34:20,492 --> 00:34:22,358
Why can't we beat him up?

716
00:34:22,494 --> 00:34:23,552
What for?

717
00:34:23,662 --> 00:34:26,529
The astrologer
said he'll die at 40

718
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:28,793
He died at 40
so it's his fault

719
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,499
- You're right
- Yes, I'm

720
00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:33,128
- So who do we beat up now?
- The dead one

721
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:35,203
You can have him later
Have this one now

722
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:39,277
- (whispers) His brother is here
- I'd like to say something

723
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:41,477
These rascals who kill themselves

724
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,674
They're the most selfish men in the world

725
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:45,841
- You're right
- Yes, I'm

726
00:34:46,785 --> 00:34:49,117
Come on, brother
You've one how

727
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:52,388
-1 hope all is well
- Oh yes, it's all well

728
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:56,558
Some day, you'll also get a chance
Things should be even better then

729
00:34:57,362 --> 00:34:58,523
Of course

730
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,325
We'll celebrate in his house

731
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:03,226
So, who actually died here?

732
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:38,564
"The nocturnal bird awakes"

733
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:41,867
"The nightly jasmines bloom"

734
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:45,133
"Nestled in the bamboo grove"

735
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:48,405
Night came and the child slept
Which hell were you in?

736
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:51,813
- My coworker committed suicide
- That's his fate

737
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:54,351
Anyway, you find a reason all the time

738
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:58,547
Do you know how many times I rang you?
Why did you switch off your phone?

739
00:35:59,424 --> 00:36:00,619
My phone died

740
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:03,786
I had kept it for charging
but forgot to turn the switch on

741
00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:09,397
You know what
he hung himself in his house

742
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,365
Atleast now you turn the switch on

743
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:16,566
The member came by again
to remind about the society loan

744
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:18,575
I'll be the next one to hang myself

745
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:20,577
- [Suni] Stop talking nonsense, woman

746
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,579
Then what do you think I should do?

747
00:36:22,781 --> 00:36:26,308
My brothers agreed to lend you
but you can't accept their offer

748
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:29,719
Your purse is empty
but your heart is vain

749
00:36:30,255 --> 00:36:32,690
I already ate
Just give me some water

750
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,793
Why don't you go home?
It's been some time now

751
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:43,494
Hello, just look at me

752
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:46,195
Don't you think that I'll go
and bring the money

753
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:47,494
I promise I won't

754
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:49,198
I'll go after her birthday

755
00:36:49,841 --> 00:36:52,310
Birthday?
And what shall I make?

756
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:55,479
I sent you away in the morning
with a list of things to buy

757
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,741
Didn't he give it to you?

758
00:36:56,848 --> 00:36:58,247
-Who?
- Prasad

759
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:00,351
Neither Prasad came
nor anybody else

760
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:02,350
How can that be?

761
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:03,921
I told him to bring it to you

762
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,989
Hello, it's 2.30 now

763
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:12,991
- Normal people sleep at this time
- But I've to ask him now

764
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,335
- Suni brother
- Didn't you deliver the package home?

765
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:19,562
did

766
00:37:19,671 --> 00:37:21,196
He says he gave it to you

767
00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:26,335
- Then where did it go?
- She says you didn't

768
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:29,470
Why should [ lie to you?

769
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,640
If you don't trust me
ask her yourself

770
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:35,577
- Hey
-Yes

771
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,255
It's Suni brother
He says I didn't give it to you

772
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:39,720
Tell him I did

773
00:37:42,494 --> 00:37:44,758
Hello
He gave them to me, Suni brother

774
00:37:44,863 --> 00:37:45,989
Eh?

775
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:48,425
But what was that candle for?

776
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:52,235
To set me on fire

777
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:53,701
Give him that phone

778
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,005
Yes, Suni brother?

779
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:59,901
I asked you to give it to my wife
and you gave it to yours

780
00:38:02,347 --> 00:38:04,679
You better return everything tomorrow

781
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:06,710
Otherwise, I'll kill you

782
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:09,777
And light a candle at your funeral

783
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:22,695
-1told him to --
- Don't give me any excuse

784
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:25,493
This shows how irresonsible you're

785
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,604
Don't make any promise
but make sure you child doesn't starve

786
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:33,543
Canyou look into my eyes and speak?

787
00:38:37,382 --> 00:38:39,077
Your life is just about you

788
00:38:40,018 --> 00:38:42,043
Everyday you come home drunk...

789
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:45,351
People will laugh at me
if I say that I'm Suni's wife

790
00:38:47,025 --> 00:38:48,049
Look at me

791
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:50,828
And your daughter?
Do you think she is proud of you?

792
00:38:53,598 --> 00:38:55,589
Forget about us

793
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,498
Aren't you ashsmed of yourself?

794
00:38:57,602 --> 00:38:59,502
Kicking up a row with that lewd woman?

795
00:38:59,604 --> 00:39:01,072
With shopkeepers?

796
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,668
Do you know what it means to be respected?

797
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:10,879
You reek of alcohol and what not

798
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:13,507
1 don't like it at all, you know

799
00:39:15,587 --> 00:39:17,783
I need a shower, that's all

800
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:19,851
What's the matter then?

801
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:22,824
I'll take the 4 O'clock train
and meet your brothers

802
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:27,531
- Anyway, we can't go to bed to tonight
- You, not we

803
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:30,358
Do whatever you want
I don't care anymore

804
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:34,869
Hey

805
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:37,698
Have you heard that song?

806
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:39,941
"My flower"

807
00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:42,571
"When I don't see you" —-

808
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,375
You get drunk and act like a Romeo

809
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:45,676
Go away

810
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:49,014
- Thanks to a song once, I suffer now
- That song is so unlucky for me

811
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:50,814
- Move aside
- What happened, mother?

812
00:39:50,922 --> 00:39:53,653
I'm going to have a shower
Is there a towel in there?

813
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:45,801
So you've decided to leave?

814
00:40:46,711 --> 00:40:48,076
Yes, father

815
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:53,845
Then you better go right now
You can't once they are back

816
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:07,225
My little girl?

817
00:41:07,532 --> 00:41:10,058
That house is for all of us

818
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:13,037
But I can't complete it now

819
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,849
"Like dewdrops"

820
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:04,755
"that whelm tender shrubs"

821
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:09,089
"And the glimmer"

822
00:42:10,595 --> 00:42:12,927
"in my heart's crux"

823
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:17,164
"We walk down"

824
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,168
"the sunshiny rustic lane"

825
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:25,575
"Together"

826
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:28,911
“inseparable, in twain"

827
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:33,180
"Like dewdrops"

828
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:37,014
"that whelm tender shrubs"

829
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:41,154
"And the glimmer"

830
00:42:42,794 --> 00:42:45,092
"in my heart's crux"

831
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:09,983
"In the garden of desires"

832
00:43:11,222 --> 00:43:13,691
"On the wishing plant that inspires”

833
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:18,796
"Afloret opens a hopeful eye"

834
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:21,798
"As gently time flies by"

835
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,166
"A fleeting smile"

836
00:43:24,302 --> 00:43:26,270
"A passing pain"

837
00:43:26,404 --> 00:43:28,930
"Harmonising days and nights in vain"

838
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:32,202
"Beauty is the byword of that love"

839
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:36,745
"Our unspoken, tacit love"

840
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,616
"Like dewdrops"

841
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:53,226
"that whelm tender shrubs"

842
00:43:54,265 --> 00:43:56,632
"And the glimmer"

843
00:43:59,337 --> 00:44:01,772
"in my heart's crux"

844
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:22,122
"Through journeys we make together"

845
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,625
"Do we seek one another?"

846
00:44:27,365 --> 00:44:29,766
"And the rainbow that glints"

847
00:44:31,302 --> 00:44:33,703
"In the heart of our hearts?"

848
00:44:35,206 --> 00:44:37,402
"Now my mind is a clear sky"

849
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:41,169
"Where you are brilliant sun, O my"

850
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,178
"Like water from a spring"

851
00:44:46,284 --> 00:44:48,776
"Our virtuous love will grow, telling"

852
00:44:59,297 --> 00:45:01,766
"Like dewdrops"

853
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:04,667
"that whelm tender shrubs"

854
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,840
"And the glimmer"

855
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,844
"in my heart's crux"

856
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:17,682
"We walk down"

857
00:45:19,283 --> 00:45:21,718
"the sunshiny rustic lane"

858
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:25,151
"Together"

859
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:30,457
“inseparable, in twain"

860
00:45:31,262 --> 00:45:33,731
"Like dewdrops"

861
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:37,330
"that whelm tender shrubs"

862
00:45:38,936 --> 00:45:41,234
"And the glimmer"

863
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:45,238
"in my heart's crux"

864
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:24,342
Yes, yes
I'm coming

865
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,193
Who's calling at this time?

866
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:54,334
- What's the matter, Suni brother?
- (Suni) Come soon

867
00:47:54,472 --> 00:47:56,566
(Suni) A liquor truck fell over the bridge

868
00:47:56,907 --> 00:47:58,500
- (Suni) It's loaded
- What?

869
00:47:58,609 --> 00:47:59,906
(Suni) Just come soon

870
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:01,205
(Suni) Get Thaamara and Kochan

871
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:02,835
(Suni) Hurry up

872
00:48:03,147 --> 00:48:04,512
I'll come right away

873
00:48:10,421 --> 00:48:13,118
- What's the matter?
- I'll tell you when I'm back

874
00:48:13,424 --> 00:48:15,222
Oh, underwear

875
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:19,629
-Where're you going all dressed up?
- My underwear has some serious business

876
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:21,522
Underwears are such a pain

877
00:48:21,632 --> 00:48:24,101
-Where're you going?
- I'll tell you when I'm back

878
00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:41,474
Here

879
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:42,882
Hello

880
00:48:42,987 --> 00:48:45,046
- Where the hell are you?
- (Sulfi) We're almost there

881
00:48:45,156 --> 00:48:47,250
Karuppaayi brother and Thaamara are here

882
00:48:49,193 --> 00:48:50,661
Are you here?

883
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:53,487
Stop here

884
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:56,326
No, don't stop

885
00:48:56,467 --> 00:48:57,935
-Why not?
- Take the other route

886
00:48:58,035 --> 00:48:59,662
That's where we can load the stock

887
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:02,035
- Go on, move
- Thaamara, jump in

888
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:03,937
Turn around and come down

889
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:05,338
Go

890
00:49:13,317 --> 00:49:15,217
Hey you, turn the lights off

891
00:49:17,755 --> 00:49:20,725
- Dear Kocha, do you see this?
- What's it?

892
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:24,487
Come, have a look
We can't finish this in a lifetime

893
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:26,494
Turn the torchlight on

894
00:49:26,764 --> 00:49:29,290
See, from jawan to king
it's all there

895
00:49:30,034 --> 00:49:32,025
Thaamara, your jai jawan

896
00:49:33,604 --> 00:49:35,538
Don't jump on it
Wait

897
00:49:35,673 --> 00:49:37,004
You'll break the bottles

898
00:49:37,107 --> 00:49:38,734
(Suni and Karuppaayi talk at once)

899
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:40,374
Get up
(Thaamara weeps)

900
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:42,742
Where's the driver?

901
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:44,344
I searched but couldn't find him

902
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:45,540
Let's get to work

903
00:49:45,683 --> 00:49:48,015
- My jai jawan
- Take as many but be quiet

904
00:49:48,552 --> 00:49:51,214
- Brother, but where's the driver?
- No driver?

905
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:52,551
This is Karnataka vehicle

906
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:54,954
- There is nobody inisde
- What if they're smugglers?

907
00:49:55,059 --> 00:49:57,084
- Then they'd have escaped
- What about the police?

908
00:49:57,194 --> 00:49:59,356
The police don't know yet
Antony opens his store early

909
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:01,022
If people come to know
then that's it

910
00:50:01,131 --> 00:50:02,326
Try to grab as many as possible

911
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:03,991
Come along

912
00:50:04,802 --> 00:50:07,669
Don't go for pints
Only litres and full bottles

913
00:50:08,105 --> 00:50:10,130
Thaamara, you need to hurry

914
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:12,635
We can't carry them as such
the police'll nab us

915
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:15,268
-Why?
- We need to put them in sacks

916
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:16,345
Where do we get sacks now?

917
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,606
There're a few in my van

918
00:50:17,748 --> 00:50:20,308
- Aren't these enough for us?
- My dear Kocha...

919
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,209
This is Godsend

920
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,182
Let's take as many as we can
Where's the sack?

921
00:50:25,289 --> 00:50:26,586
Bring them over here

922
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:29,285
- (Thaamara mumbles)
- (all talking at once)

923
00:50:29,426 --> 00:50:31,394
- Don't you have more sacks?
- Be careful

924
00:50:32,763 --> 00:50:34,231
One

925
00:50:34,498 --> 00:50:35,556
Two

926
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:37,224
- Three
-One

927
00:50:37,334 --> 00:50:40,031
Four
Kocha, don't confuse me

928
00:50:42,273 --> 00:50:45,299
- Careful, don't break my head
- Grab the Scotch, the green bottles

929
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:47,340
Catch

930
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:52,179
Thaamara, grab the costly ones
Not your jai jawan

931
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:55,748
- Hey, get the good ones
- Get whisky

932
00:50:55,853 --> 00:50:58,185
Shall I get whisky?
That's expensive, right?

933
00:50:59,323 --> 00:51:01,052
- The best ones are over there
- Where?

934
00:51:01,158 --> 00:51:02,489
Kocha, come
Let's get some more

935
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:04,060
Aren't these enough?

936
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:06,152
- What can we do with these?
- They are plastic

937
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:08,459
- Sulfi, we need more sacks
- Then let's go get them

938
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:11,466
Kochacha, fill each one to the brim
We'll bring more sacks

939
00:51:11,602 --> 00:51:13,092
- On my own?
- Thaamara is with you

940
00:51:13,203 --> 00:51:14,500
- Take this torchlight
-Let's go

941
00:51:14,638 --> 00:51:16,128
Who'll drive?

942
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:18,637
Let's call the others first

943
00:51:18,776 --> 00:51:21,211
- [Karuppaayi] Suni, let me go

944
00:51:21,779 --> 00:51:22,803
- [Karuppaayi] Hey

945
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,071
Kochacha, do as I said
Let's go

946
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:34,519
I'll break your head with it
Help me out

947
00:51:34,658 --> 00:51:36,148
I can't
I sprained my back

948
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,557
You drunkard

949
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:43,493
- Mini
- Okay then

950
00:51:45,135 --> 00:51:46,466
Damn, his mother-in-law

951
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:49,662
- Suni, where're you taking him now?
- One of the planks fell

952
00:51:49,807 --> 00:51:51,605
Need to check on that

953
00:51:51,742 --> 00:51:54,074
- Why not go inthe morning?
- It can't wait until then

954
00:51:54,178 --> 00:51:56,510
Be quiet, mother
He's with Suni brother

955
00:51:56,714 --> 00:51:57,806
Oh, Suni brother

956
00:51:57,915 --> 00:52:00,350
How did you do it
with this restive woman around?

957
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:05,116
- Some pricks build such houses
- I'll build one when I go to Gulf

958
00:52:05,222 --> 00:52:07,589
- Suni brother
- This is going to be our day

959
00:52:08,425 --> 00:52:09,722
Get that pole

960
00:52:11,395 --> 00:52:13,420
Suni brother, hold tight
My legs are shaky

961
00:52:13,564 --> 00:52:15,328
Don't worry
I've a strong grip

962
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:16,729
Sulfi, here they come

963
00:52:16,834 --> 00:52:18,393
Throw them down

964
00:52:18,936 --> 00:52:21,428
- Is somebody watching us?
- There's nobody around

965
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:32,874
- Turn the light off
- Come, let's hurry

966
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,879
- Shanavas, here
- Bring them over

967
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:37,346
Come on
Where's Thaamara?

968
00:52:38,455 --> 00:52:40,617
1 told you to get them ready
and you sleep off

969
00:52:40,758 --> 00:52:43,193
- Go fill up the sacks
- Thaamara is already tipsy

970
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:44,590
Shanavas?

971
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:48,193
1 don't know what I'll do with him
Get up and do as I say

972
00:52:49,233 --> 00:52:51,258
These are quite expensive

973
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:53,728
Suni brother, so what's the plan?

974
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:55,305
Plan?
We share the booty among us

975
00:52:55,439 --> 00:52:57,168
- Karuppaayi?
- Move aside

976
00:52:58,709 --> 00:53:01,440
We've to make it big with this

977
00:53:01,979 --> 00:53:03,606
Yes, we'll

978
00:53:03,747 --> 00:53:05,909
We'll find a way
First let's move these things

979
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,208
What about the share?

980
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:09,615
Equal share

981
00:53:11,255 --> 00:53:13,223
Sure?
Yes, man

982
00:53:13,323 --> 00:53:14,620
Can we get the job done?

983
00:53:15,726 --> 00:53:17,524
- Make it quick
- No, not those

984
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:19,561
Leave the plastic ones behind

985
00:53:20,998 --> 00:53:22,397
Where is he going?

986
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:23,830
Thaamara?

987
00:53:24,835 --> 00:53:27,566
- You guys will drive me mad
- The bottles will break

988
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:30,300
Where do we hide them?

989
00:53:30,441 --> 00:53:31,567
We'll take them to the islet

990
00:53:31,709 --> 00:53:32,767
We can't take them all

991
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:34,810
- We'll make several trips
- That'll do

992
00:53:35,412 --> 00:53:36,777
Catch

993
00:53:51,028 --> 00:53:52,359
A ghost

994
00:53:52,496 --> 00:53:54,362
- What happened?
- What's it?

995
00:53:54,498 --> 00:53:55,932
- A ghost
- Where?

996
00:53:56,533 --> 00:53:57,898
What's the matter?

997
00:53:58,368 --> 00:53:59,927
- Suni brother?
- What're you doing here?

998
00:54:00,037 --> 00:54:02,199
- I think the driver's here
- Are you sure?

999
00:54:02,306 --> 00:54:03,398
Lift him up

1000
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,235
- Can it be the driver?
- No, his assistant

1001
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:07,811
- Help me here
- What shall we do now?

1002
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:10,337
(all taking at once)

1003
00:54:10,481 --> 00:54:11,971
Leave him there
Why bid trouble?

1004
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:13,341
Let's lift him up first

1005
00:54:13,484 --> 00:54:14,918
We can't waste a man's life

1006
00:54:25,529 --> 00:54:26,690
Get down

1007
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:28,525
You guys continue
I'll be back soon

1008
00:54:28,665 --> 00:54:30,030
You stay put, I'll manage

1009
00:54:30,634 --> 00:54:33,331
- Sulfi, be back soon
- Don't worry, I'll

1010
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:36,636
Suni brother, look what he's doing

1011
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:38,242
Gone case

1012
00:54:38,342 --> 00:54:40,242
- Here
- Take this

1013
00:54:48,986 --> 00:54:51,512
God, this has turned into an ambulance

1014
00:55:04,368 --> 00:55:06,268
I'm drenched in blood

1015
00:55:08,539 --> 00:55:10,303
- Hello?
- You brought the patient in?

1016
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:11,965
-Yes
- How did the accident happen?

1017
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:14,373
I was returning after a trip

1018
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:15,808
I found him on the road

1019
00:55:15,913 --> 00:55:17,347
Sol brought him here

1020
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:19,472
- His condition is critical
-Is that so?

1021
00:55:19,783 --> 00:55:21,376
Okay then, goodbye

1022
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:23,577
- [nurse] Brother, you can't leave

1023
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,085
- You should wait for the doctor
-Why?

1024
00:55:25,355 --> 00:55:26,720
Sir wants to see you

1025
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:28,985
- Where's the casualty?
- Over there

1026
00:55:29,126 --> 00:55:30,594
Das brother

1027
00:55:31,929 --> 00:55:34,921
- Brother, please pay the bill
-Why should 1?

1028
00:55:35,032 --> 00:55:36,625
Patient needs IV fluid

1029
00:55:36,767 --> 00:55:38,064
Pay the bill

1030
00:55:47,611 --> 00:55:48,544
How is he?

1031
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:50,044
Suni brother

1032
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:51,978
Any problem?

1033
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:53,917
I'll run off from here

1034
00:55:55,118 --> 00:55:58,748
We need to get the maximum load
or else our plan won't work

1035
00:55:59,122 --> 00:56:01,022
We're all set here
You be back soon

1036
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:02,717
Which hospital are you in?

1037
00:56:02,826 --> 00:56:04,988
Government hospital refused to take him in

1038
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:07,393
I'm in a private hospital
I've spent a good sum here

1039
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:08,589
Please note it down, okay

1040
00:56:08,732 --> 00:56:10,666
We'll do that later
You better hurry up

1041
00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:15,605
Tough job, huh?

1042
00:56:15,772 --> 00:56:17,331
Oh, it's worse sometimes

1043
00:56:18,609 --> 00:56:20,373
Were you involved in the accident?

1044
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:23,940
Dear brother, would I be alive then?
Even my van would be smashed

1045
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:25,037
Don't act like a fool

1046
00:56:25,148 --> 00:56:26,616
Where is he from?

1047
00:56:26,783 --> 00:56:29,115
I don't know for sure
but he was crying "aiyo"

1048
00:56:29,853 --> 00:56:32,618
- Does "aiyo™ mean "aiyo" in Hindi also?
- Of course

1049
00:56:34,491 --> 00:56:37,358
Brother, is that the only exit?

1050
00:56:37,494 --> 00:56:41,124
- Yes, that's the only exit
- And you're wide awake

1051
00:56:43,967 --> 00:56:46,834
Kocha, here
Take this one too

1052
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:49,528
Hush, be quiet

1053
00:56:51,675 --> 00:56:53,643
- Who's that?
- Keep this aside

1054
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:57,612
Well, let's just hide

1055
00:56:58,615 --> 00:57:00,140
You be quiet

1056
00:57:01,585 --> 00:57:03,815
- Stop talking
- Let me look

1057
00:57:05,489 --> 00:57:06,923
Come with me

1058
00:57:09,493 --> 00:57:11,791
-Who're they?
- Must be anglers

1059
00:57:14,865 --> 00:57:16,458
They're not going to leave

1060
00:57:16,667 --> 00:57:17,998
Let's move the sacks

1061
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,159
We'll keep them there

1062
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:21,130
Come on
Let's move the sacks

1063
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:42,417
Where're you off to?

1064
00:57:42,726 --> 00:57:44,558
Brother, there's no signal inside

1065
00:57:44,695 --> 00:57:46,094
There's enough signal for you

1066
00:57:46,196 --> 00:57:49,427
- Sol can't step out?
- Not until the matter is solved

1067
00:57:50,934 --> 00:57:53,096
I'll never help a dying man again

1068
00:57:53,203 --> 00:57:55,001
I'll stop helping people from now

1069
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:56,871
That man is awake now

1070
00:57:57,207 --> 00:58:00,837
- But your statements don't match
- They don't?

1071
00:58:03,013 --> 00:58:04,447
Come back here

1072
00:58:04,581 --> 00:58:05,707
If you act too smart

1073
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:06,941
I'll beat you up

1074
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:08,142
Now sit down
Yes

1075
00:58:08,285 --> 00:58:11,152
Wait until the police come
Thinks he can fool me

1076
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:15,158
Fasten firmly, Karuppaayi

1077
00:58:15,993 --> 00:58:17,085
Where are you?

1078
00:58:17,194 --> 00:58:18,684
- [Sulfi] I can't come, brother

1079
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:20,058
- [Sulfi] They've detained me

1080
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:21,995
- What's it?
- [Sulfi] I'm trapped

1081
00:58:22,632 --> 00:58:23,656
What happened to him?

1082
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,097
He can't come

1083
00:58:25,736 --> 00:58:27,170
The security's detained him

1084
00:58:28,905 --> 00:58:30,270
What shall we do now?

1085
00:58:30,574 --> 00:58:32,042
(the muezzin's call)

1086
00:58:36,313 --> 00:58:37,872
It's morning already

1087
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:42,811
Suni brother
Let's move them elsewhere

1088
00:58:42,986 --> 00:58:44,784
Maybe the bushes near the temple

1089
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:47,151
- No, we can't
- The temple'll be open by now

1090
00:58:47,758 --> 00:58:49,658
You know the old bridge?

1091
00:58:50,727 --> 00:58:52,627
We'll hide them under its pillar

1092
00:58:52,763 --> 00:58:55,061
- Shanavas, did you count?
- Why should he count?

1093
00:58:55,565 --> 00:58:56,691
Pick them up

1094
00:58:56,833 --> 00:58:58,494
Here, take it

1095
00:59:05,342 --> 00:59:06,537
Here

1096
00:59:06,676 --> 00:59:08,041
Give me

1097
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:12,982
- Suni brother
- Pass iton

1098
00:59:16,787 --> 00:59:18,255
Come let's go

1099
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:20,649
Thaamara, pick some large stones

1100
00:59:20,791 --> 00:59:22,816
Fasten them to the sacks
Just go with him

1101
00:59:22,926 --> 00:59:25,122
Hey, don't sleep off
Bring them over here

1102
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:41,105
Now tie a stone to each sack

1103
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:55,618
- They're glass
- Be careful

1104
00:59:55,959 --> 00:59:57,552
Hey, watch out

1105
00:59:57,828 --> 00:59:59,296
- Have you tied the stones?
-Yes

1106
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,086
- Don't break them
- Catch these

1107
01:00:23,386 --> 01:00:25,252
The car has to be here by now

1108
01:00:34,197 --> 01:00:35,926
Tea

1109
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:40,134
They've offered welfare standing committee

1110
01:00:41,171 --> 01:00:42,764
Is it useful?

1111
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:44,670
Definitely

1112
01:00:44,808 --> 01:00:47,140
The panchayat has two quarries
and a sandbank

1113
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:49,373
Sand is costlier than gold these days

1114
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:51,277
I'll have fun

1115
01:00:59,723 --> 01:01:01,088
(phone rings in background)

1116
01:01:01,424 --> 01:01:03,085
Hello, we're in the church

1117
01:01:03,793 --> 01:01:04,817
Father?

1118
01:01:04,928 --> 01:01:06,259
When is the noconfidence vote?

1119
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:07,659
10 O'clock, Father

1120
01:01:07,797 --> 01:01:09,993
When you become president
come straight to the church

1121
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:11,295
I need your blessings, Father

1122
01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:12,902
Sure

1123
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:16,068
No-confidence will be passed today

1124
01:01:16,873 --> 01:01:18,341
I'm going to lose my job

1125
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:21,177
I sailed alone all the time

1126
01:01:21,311 --> 01:01:23,837
That too with such hostile people on board

1127
01:01:24,014 --> 01:01:26,449
But I wasn't expecting this twist

1128
01:01:28,418 --> 01:01:30,250
No, we know he's a fraud

1129
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:32,989
We don't know where he's hiding

1130
01:01:33,089 --> 01:01:35,114
Or else, we'd have nabbed him earlier

1131
01:01:35,425 --> 01:01:37,450
But now it's too late

1132
01:01:41,231 --> 01:01:42,824
I'll call you later

1133
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:53,373
- Prakash, any news of him?
- It's tipped again

1134
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:54,841
He's tipped again?

1135
01:01:54,945 --> 01:01:56,709
It's another accident on the bridge

1136
01:01:56,846 --> 01:01:58,109
I thought he tipped over again

1137
01:01:58,215 --> 01:01:59,979
You're always thinking about it

1138
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:02,780
There's utter confusion there
We've to call the police

1139
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:04,179
It's a liquor truck

1140
01:02:04,321 --> 01:02:05,447
Which bank?

1141
01:02:05,755 --> 01:02:07,280
Opposite bank
Why?

1142
01:02:08,425 --> 01:02:10,951
You wait here
I'll go with you

1143
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:02,237
God is with me

1144
01:03:02,379 --> 01:03:04,177
I don't get you
What do you mean?

1145
01:03:05,181 --> 01:03:06,478
- Prakash
-Yes?

1146
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:09,218
- This has opened a new path for us
- How?

1147
01:03:09,819 --> 01:03:11,412
Whose ward is it, you fool?

1148
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:13,521
Annamma's
Shall I call her?

1149
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:16,325
Don't invite her

1150
01:03:16,893 --> 01:03:19,021
- But make sure she arrives
I'll set it up

1151
01:03:19,262 --> 01:03:21,526
Aren't you guys ashamed to do this?

1152
01:03:21,831 --> 01:03:24,198
- (commotion)
- You're a disgrace to our village

1153
01:03:24,334 --> 01:03:26,234
- Move aside
- President, watch out

1154
01:03:26,403 --> 01:03:27,495
President, don't you see this?

1155
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:30,273
Where're you taking them?
Put the bottles back

1156
01:03:30,407 --> 01:03:32,933
- Nobody is listening
- Hold them off

1157
01:03:33,343 --> 01:03:36,108
- (commotion)
- They've turned this into a circus

1158
01:03:37,881 --> 01:03:40,179
Hello?
Is this SI sir?

1159
01:03:46,022 --> 01:03:47,490
President has arrived

1160
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:49,189
Let's check out

1161
01:03:50,894 --> 01:03:52,555
Come, Kochaa
Come on

1162
01:03:52,962 --> 01:03:54,589
- Where?
-Just come

1163
01:03:55,365 --> 01:03:57,561
What're they doing?
This is so sad

1164
01:04:00,403 --> 01:04:01,461
- (commotion)
- Suni?

1165
01:04:01,604 --> 01:04:03,436
- (commotion)
- Why do you need so much?

1166
01:04:03,573 --> 01:04:05,405
- Your liver will stop working
- Suni

1167
01:04:05,542 --> 01:04:07,806
[Suni] Stop this madness
Put them back

1168
01:04:08,178 --> 01:04:10,806
- Sir, do somethng
- Who, me?

1169
01:04:11,147 --> 01:04:13,343
- (commotion)
- (several people talking at once)

1170
01:04:13,483 --> 01:04:14,951
- [Suni] Give it back
- Run off

1171
01:04:15,051 --> 01:04:16,348
The police are here

1172
01:04:16,553 --> 01:04:17,987
(commotion)

1173
01:04:18,088 --> 01:04:19,613
[Suni] Nobody takes anything

1174
01:04:19,923 --> 01:04:21,857
[Suni] as long as we're here

1175
01:04:22,425 --> 01:04:23,893
Go away

1176
01:04:23,993 --> 01:04:25,358
Sir, you see this?

1177
01:04:25,495 --> 01:04:27,486
[President] You please drive them away

1178
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:29,155
Go home, run

1179
01:04:29,933 --> 01:04:31,094
Hey, go home

1180
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:33,192
Don't run away with them

1181
01:04:36,373 --> 01:04:38,398
(commotion)

1182
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:41,340
Kochaa, come

1183
01:04:41,478 --> 01:04:43,003
- Go home
- Shoo off

1184
01:04:43,113 --> 01:04:44,478
Kochaa, be calm

1185
01:04:44,681 --> 01:04:46,149
[Karuppaayi] Why drag me away?

1186
01:04:46,249 --> 01:04:47,512
[Suni] Becuase you're being a poser

1187
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:50,051
- Please don't, I'm a teacher
- Then stay away from here

1188
01:04:50,153 --> 01:04:51,484
- Go away
- Okay

1189
01:05:05,301 --> 01:05:06,598
Come

1190
01:05:07,937 --> 01:05:09,905
Sir, can we check your bag?

1191
01:05:10,006 --> 01:05:11,667
Why?
Let me see what's inside

1192
01:05:11,941 --> 01:05:14,239
- There are just books in my bag
- Let's see then

1193
01:05:14,978 --> 01:05:16,207
Look out everybody

1194
01:05:16,312 --> 01:05:18,474
This schoolteacher stole a pint

1195
01:05:18,615 --> 01:05:21,107
- It's for the lab
- So children come to the lab to drink?

1196
01:05:21,217 --> 01:05:23,276
What'll children learn from him?

1197
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:24,478
Such a shame!

1198
01:05:24,621 --> 01:05:26,521
How do you respond to this incident?

1199
01:05:26,656 --> 01:05:28,181
What incident?

1200
01:05:28,558 --> 01:05:30,219
We all drink

1201
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,692
But we buy them
and pay the tax

1202
01:05:32,962 --> 01:05:34,361
We don't steal like this

1203
01:05:34,697 --> 01:05:36,165
I'd like to say something

1204
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:38,360
These teachers frown on drunks like us

1205
01:05:38,501 --> 01:05:41,095
But their salary goes from our money

1206
01:05:41,204 --> 01:05:42,535
Geetha sister

1207
01:05:43,072 --> 01:05:44,904
Suni brother is on TV

1208
01:05:46,142 --> 01:05:47,610
Suni brother is on TV

1209
01:05:47,744 --> 01:05:48,973
Hurry up, mother

1210
01:05:49,078 --> 01:05:51,103
When a liquor truck tips
and people steal

1211
01:05:51,214 --> 01:05:52,682
can you call them civilised?

1212
01:05:53,983 --> 01:05:55,473
Mother, father's on TV

1213
01:05:55,985 --> 01:05:57,714
If a cash truck tips
will they take cash?

1214
01:05:57,987 --> 01:05:59,512
Or a gas truck tips
they take gas?

1215
01:05:59,656 --> 01:06:01,215
When did he change his clothes?

1216
01:06:01,357 --> 01:06:02,518
This is disgusting

1217
01:06:02,659 --> 01:06:05,287
Disgrace to our village
and even Kochachan

1218
01:06:05,662 --> 01:06:07,426
Can you give me your phone?

1219
01:06:07,564 --> 01:06:09,726
I want to take his photo
for school

1220
01:06:09,999 --> 01:06:12,468
No need of that
The way he looks

1221
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:15,536
Suni?

1222
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,034
So this is why he left early?

1223
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:41,561
What's the time now?

1224
01:06:41,698 --> 01:06:43,462
- It's past 10
- Have you set it up?

1225
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:44,533
Yes

1226
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:46,692
- Where are they?
-In the coconut grove

1227
01:06:46,803 --> 01:06:48,567
Okay, let's go then

1228
01:06:51,174 --> 01:06:53,233
We can't stay any longer
Let's go

1229
01:06:53,576 --> 01:06:55,476
- Where shall we go now?
- To work?

1230
01:06:55,645 --> 01:06:57,010
At this hour?

1231
01:06:57,113 --> 01:06:58,376
Let Kochan call and find out

1232
01:06:58,515 --> 01:07:00,677
- He'll give me an earful
- You call him

1233
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:09,617
Hello

1234
01:07:09,759 --> 01:07:11,488
We'll come to work today

1235
01:07:12,328 --> 01:07:13,591
Half the wage will do

1236
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:15,255
[Suni whispers]

1237
01:07:15,832 --> 01:07:17,459
We're only four

1238
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:21,564
Okay

1239
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:24,036
He'll send three Bengalis away
Let's go then

1240
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:25,574
- Hey, come here
- Suni brother?

1241
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:26,800
Let him stay here

1242
01:07:27,076 --> 01:07:28,544
You watch
For trouble, call

1243
01:07:28,678 --> 01:07:30,510
Okay, Suni brother
Alright

1244
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:32,310
- What about him?
- Drag him along

1245
01:07:32,448 --> 01:07:34,439
What's this?
Come on

1246
01:07:35,118 --> 01:07:36,643
- Do you have any money?
- About Rupeeloo

1247
01:07:36,786 --> 01:07:38,777
-And you?
- My money is in the water

1248
01:07:42,825 --> 01:07:44,486
What are the procedures?

1249
01:07:44,627 --> 01:07:46,026
Section has changed

1250
01:07:46,129 --> 01:07:47,358
It's with excise department now

1251
01:07:47,497 --> 01:07:48,658
Sir'll tell you

1252
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:51,460
We've to record the stock
after sorting the brands

1253
01:07:52,201 --> 01:07:53,635
Other procedures will follow later

1254
01:07:53,770 --> 01:07:54,828
Okay

1255
01:07:55,104 --> 01:07:57,129
Sir, I've to be in panchayat by 11

01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:01,267
-Let's go
- Okay ma'am

1258
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,242
Annamma, you can't leave now
You are answerable here

1259
01:08:06,382 --> 01:08:07,372
This is your ward

1260
01:08:07,517 --> 01:08:09,076
(noise drowns out dialogue)

1261
01:08:09,185 --> 01:08:10,482
So many accidents have occured

1262
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:11,815
What've you done about it?

1263
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:14,056
- Keep calm
- No, don't say another word

1264
01:08:15,158 --> 01:08:16,489
Can you please let me pass?

1265
01:08:16,626 --> 01:08:18,253
No, we won't let you go

1266
01:08:18,394 --> 01:08:20,123
Stand aside please

1267
01:08:21,564 --> 01:08:22,827
I've to leave now

1268
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:25,261

1269
01:08:26,169 --> 01:08:28,365
-Annamma, we won't let you go
- Move

1270
01:08:28,671 --> 01:08:30,161
What's this?

1271
01:08:30,273 --> 01:08:32,367
- (inquilab calls)
- Ma'am, get into the car

1272
01:08:35,578 --> 01:08:37,774
We need justice

1273
01:08:39,749 --> 01:08:41,274
(inquilab calls)

1274
01:08:42,485 --> 01:08:43,820
Don't let her go

1275
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:44,082
Don't let her go

1276
01:08:48,257 --> 01:08:49,656
When can we take them?

1277
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:50,884
At night

1278
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:52,150
Once Sulfiis back

1279
01:08:52,261 --> 01:08:53,729
we will shift the sacks

1280
01:08:54,831 --> 01:08:56,162
Did you call him?

1281
01:08:56,265 --> 01:08:57,391
No, I couldn't

1282
01:08:57,533 --> 01:08:58,659
Will he screw us up?

1283
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:00,200
Never

1284
01:09:00,303 --> 01:09:01,702
He won't do that

1285
01:09:02,705 --> 01:09:03,638
Let me call Shanavas

1286
01:09:03,773 --> 01:09:05,241
Okay

1287
01:09:08,678 --> 01:09:09,645
Hey

1288
01:09:09,779 --> 01:09:10,769
Where're you going?

1289
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,348
To pee

1290
01:09:22,291 --> 01:09:23,588
Suni brother

1291
01:09:25,628 --> 01:09:26,857
Hello, Suni brother

1292
01:09:26,963 --> 01:09:28,328
They lifted the truck

1293
01:09:28,464 --> 01:09:29,659
Did you check on our sacks?

1294
01:09:29,799 --> 01:09:30,925
No, I didn't

1295
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:32,429
Don't roam around

1296
01:09:32,568 --> 01:09:33,729
Check out the sacks

1297
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:34,826
Okay

1298
01:09:34,937 --> 01:09:36,200
Go soon

1299
01:09:36,305 --> 01:09:37,602
I'll call you later

1300
01:09:37,774 --> 01:09:38,900
Any problem?

1301
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:40,540
Nothing

1302
01:09:40,877 --> 01:09:42,845
You were the first to see it

1303
01:09:43,312 --> 01:09:45,371
You are asking me
what's Raman to Sita?

1304
01:09:45,515 --> 01:09:46,914
Is he dead?

1305
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:48,948
Nobody died here

1306
01:09:49,419 --> 01:09:51,217
Kocha, stop scaring me

1307
01:09:54,323 --> 01:09:55,757
What if he dies?

1308
01:09:56,292 --> 01:09:58,226
Kocha, don't make me mad

1309
01:09:59,595 --> 01:10:01,188
(wakes up screaming)

1310
01:10:02,999 --> 01:10:04,296
What's it?

1311
01:10:04,434 --> 01:10:05,526
I was —

1312
01:10:05,668 --> 01:10:08,535
Don't get supervisor angry
Go back to work

1313
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:11,431
What can I do now?

1314
01:10:14,577 --> 01:10:16,170
- Suni
-Yes

1315
01:10:16,279 --> 01:10:18,976
I've not given Thankam any money
for the new house

1316
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:22,477
I want to give her some money

1317
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:24,312
Then I'll complete the house work

1318
01:10:24,454 --> 01:10:26,821
and live happily with my family

1319
01:10:30,326 --> 01:10:32,658
I'm fed up of sleeping
at this idiot's place

1320
01:10:34,464 --> 01:10:36,432
What about me, Kochaa?

1321
01:10:36,733 --> 01:10:38,360
I was on my way to borrow money

1322
01:10:38,501 --> 01:10:40,799
That's when God sent this my way

1323
01:10:42,271 --> 01:10:44,330
All will be well soon

1324
01:10:45,575 --> 01:10:46,542
Hey

1325
01:10:46,676 --> 01:10:49,373
Can we visit Palani
with our families?

1326
01:10:49,946 --> 01:10:51,914
I'm okay with Sabarimala

1327
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:54,478
Not how

1328
01:10:54,617 --> 01:10:56,381
I want a strong gate

1329
01:10:56,519 --> 01:10:58,317
Afan in my bedroom

1330
01:10:58,454 --> 01:11:00,013
We'll put up a room on top

1331
01:11:00,289 --> 01:11:02,280
That we'll be our haunt

1332
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:07,324
Can we get Rupee34 lakh?

1333
01:11:07,463 --> 01:11:08,828
Definitely

1334
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:10,558
Definitely

1335
01:11:11,567 --> 01:11:13,035
We should change our setup

1336
01:11:13,302 --> 01:11:14,895
We'll have a blast

1337
01:11:16,372 --> 01:11:17,498
One minute

1338
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:18,801
Tell me

1339
01:11:18,908 --> 01:11:20,433
Suni brother, there's a problem

1340
01:11:20,576 --> 01:11:21,873
What happened?

1341
01:11:21,978 --> 01:11:23,605

Go away before sunset

Several lakhs worth liquor are missing

Turn that way

1373
01:13:23,532 --> 01:13:24,931
Somebody's coming

1374
01:13:26,502 --> 01:13:27,663
Suni, not working?

1375
01:13:27,803 --> 01:13:29,601
No, I didn't go today

1376
01:13:40,716 --> 01:13:42,548
It's becuase of you
that they're up

1377

You fool, I'll -

1378
01:13:44,053 --> 01:13:45,521
What did I do?

1379
01:13:46,756 --> 01:13:48,690
What you mean
it's my fault?

1380
01:13:48,824 --> 01:13:50,121
Remove your slippers

1381
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:58,567
Get down

1382
01:14:25,761 --> 01:14:27,593
Kochacha, take this

1383
01:14:32,835 --> 01:14:33,927
What to do now?

1384
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:35,560
Fasten and pull down

1385
01:14:36,739 --> 01:14:38,036
Move it aside

1386
01:14:39,175 --> 01:14:40,609
Fix it over here

1387
01:15:29,058 --> 01:15:30,526
Let's go

1388
01:15:43,172 --> 01:15:44,640
What're you doing here?

1389
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:46,230
Just having a bath

1390
01:15:47,109 --> 01:15:48,577
That's good

1391
01:15:53,849 --> 01:15:55,044
You're here too?

1392
01:15:55,184 --> 01:15:56,242
I just got here

1393
01:15:56,352 --> 01:15:57,581
You're all here?

1394
01:15:57,686 --> 01:15:58,847
You all here for a group bath?

1395
01:15:58,988 --> 01:16:01,218
Yes, we came for a swim
in the river

1396
01:16:01,624 --> 01:16:02,921
Is it?

1397
01:16:03,259 --> 01:16:05,694
Why not bring a hat and
pair of glasses?

1398
01:16:05,828 --> 01:16:07,125
Just for fun

1399
01:16:08,030 --> 01:16:09,759
Don't reply, let's go

1400
01:16:12,635 --> 01:16:14,069
Should we be worried?

1401
01:16:24,647 --> 01:16:26,240
Did you see the show
he put up today?

1402
01:16:26,348 --> 01:16:27,747
Channel, interviews

1403
01:16:27,883 --> 01:16:29,180
He made a big fuss

1404
01:16:30,753 --> 01:16:32,653
You seem to be lost

1405
01:16:33,022 --> 01:16:34,319
If my family comes to know

1406
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:35,580
there's no point living

1407
01:16:35,691 --> 01:16:36,852
You're in big trouble

1408
01:16:36,992 --> 01:16:38,255
Now dig deeper
for troubles

1409
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:40,328
Kurian, it's going to create trouble

1410
01:16:43,099 --> 01:16:44,794
Will it come on WhatsApp?

1411
01:16:44,934 --> 01:16:46,299
It'll be on WhatsApp in no time

1412
01:16:46,402 --> 01:16:47,995
For sure
Definitely

1413
01:16:48,137 --> 01:16:50,071
It'd be like stripping
in public

1414
01:16:50,739 --> 01:16:52,229
The whole world will watch

1415
01:16:53,142 --> 01:16:55,634
That Suni is the cause of it all

1416
01:16:55,744 --> 01:16:56,802
Very true

1417
01:16:56,946 --> 01:16:58,243
When I asked him to settle
his dues

1418
01:16:58,347 --> 01:16:59,644
he insulted me, sir

1419
01:16:59,748 --> 01:17:01,045
in front of my shop

1420
01:17:01,884 --> 01:17:03,181
Do you know that?

1421
01:17:04,653 --> 01:17:05,882
Has the electricity bill come?

1422
01:17:06,021 --> 01:17:07,011
Yes, it's there

1423
01:17:07,156 --> 01:17:08,988
I'll fetch Biju's bike

1424
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:10,650
Alright, see you later

1425
01:17:10,759 --> 01:17:11,726
Kurian

1426
01:17:11,861 --> 01:17:12,987
Did you see Jessy?

1427
01:17:13,129 --> 01:17:14,358
i Who?
ghway Jessy?

1428
01:17:14,663 --> 01:17:15,721
Yes

1429
01:17:15,865 --> 01:17:16,855
What do you want from her?

1430
01:17:16,999 --> 01:17:17,898
There's a letter for her

1431
01:17:18,033 --> 01:17:19,262
It's been with me for two days

1432
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:20,392
Who writes to her?

1433
01:17:20,669 --> 01:17:21,727
It's a government letter

1434
01:17:21,871 --> 01:17:23,168
Must be a job offer

1435
01:17:23,973 --> 01:17:26,305
I thought it'll help her
have a better life

1436
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:27,905
But I'm going to return it

1437
01:17:28,043 --> 01:17:31,035
When she returns from her other work
she'll lose this one

1438
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:32,113
Isn't it so?

1439
01:17:32,248 --> 01:17:33,977
You're her neighbour
can you tell her?

1440
01:17:34,116 --> 01:17:36,210
Neighbour? They're relatives

1441
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:37,786
That's why I'm silent

1442
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:38,887
We're distantly related

1443
01:17:39,021 --> 01:17:41,388
Once, I went to her place to talk

1444
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:43,421
she blasted my wife later

1445
01:17:43,692 --> 01:17:44,659
She did that to you?

1446
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:45,750
Kurian?

1447
01:17:45,895 --> 01:17:46,987
Wait

1448
01:17:47,129 --> 01:17:48,426
Sir

1449
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:50,397
When did the letter come?

1450
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:51,963
Two days ago

1451
01:17:52,268 --> 01:17:54,862
She won't stay away
for two days

1452
01:17:56,138 --> 01:17:58,038
It's been two days

1453
01:17:59,408 --> 01:18:00,807
Two days

1454
01:18:00,943 --> 01:18:02,411
Keep the flour inside

1455
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:03,736
Sister, two tea

1456
01:18:03,879 --> 01:18:05,005
Where were you?

1457
01:18:05,147 --> 01:18:06,808
You've been gone for sometime

1458
01:18:07,283 --> 01:18:09,081
I've my doubts on Suni

1459
01:18:09,218 --> 01:18:10,686
What doubt?

1460
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:13,412
Today I saw him
under mysterious circumstances

1461
01:18:13,756 --> 01:18:15,053
So what?

1462
01:18:15,457 --> 01:18:18,085
That Jessy's missing for two days

1463
01:18:18,394 --> 01:18:22,831
Keep your foul mouth shut
Don't gossip like women

1464
01:18:23,966 --> 01:18:26,901
When he insulted me
why were you quiet?

1465
01:18:27,036 --> 01:18:27,969
What do you want?

1466
01:18:28,103 --> 01:18:29,127
I'll have my revenge

1467
01:18:29,271 --> 01:18:31,035
I'll screw him
That rascal

1468
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:34,035
If you want to be thrashed
goon

1469
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:41,983
Kurian

1470
01:18:42,117 --> 01:18:43,050
Yes

1471
01:18:43,185 --> 01:18:44,277
Did Suni act on his word?

1472
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:45,376
What word?

1473
01:18:45,487 --> 01:18:46,784
What man?

1474
01:18:46,922 --> 01:18:48,856
He threatened her before us

1475
01:18:48,991 --> 01:18:49,958
Don't you remember?

1476
01:18:50,092 --> 01:18:51,025
That's right

1477
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:52,423
- Stop there
- Jessy

1478
01:18:52,528 --> 01:18:54,826
You nicked what I kept
to fix my leaky house

1479
01:18:55,364 --> 01:18:56,889
Return my money

1480
01:18:57,066 --> 01:18:57,965
You rascal

1481
01:18:58,067 --> 01:18:59,228
If you swear again

1482
01:18:59,335 --> 01:19:00,496
I'll not let you live
in peace

1483
01:19:00,769 --> 01:19:01,827
I'll knock you down

1484
01:19:01,937 --> 01:19:03,029
Sir?

1485
01:19:03,172 --> 01:19:04,697
Certain matters need more clarity

1486
01:19:04,807 --> 01:19:06,332
We'll ask Divakaran

1487
01:19:06,442 --> 01:19:08,206
Get up
come with me

1488
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:09,300
What's the matter?

1489
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:12,711
We'll meet Divakaran
to clear my doubts

1490
01:19:13,882 --> 01:19:15,179
Come on

1491
01:19:17,786 --> 01:19:19,185
I'll be back in 10 minutes

1492
01:19:19,388 --> 01:19:20,822
Okay

1493
01:19:23,292 --> 01:19:24,760
Brother?

1494
01:19:24,893 --> 01:19:26,486
Is there a reason
to doubt Suni?

1495
01:19:27,263 --> 01:19:30,893
When I saw him this morning
he'd blood on his shirt

1496
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:39,808
Oh

1497
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:42,407
He was soaking wet

1498
01:19:43,245 --> 01:19:44,542
Looked so tensed

1499
01:19:45,014 --> 01:19:46,311
Something's fishy

1500
01:19:47,182 --> 01:19:50,447
Next time he sprung up
from this river

1501
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:54,390
Not just him
his entire set

1502
01:19:54,490 --> 01:19:56,549
By then he'd changed
his clothes

1503
01:19:56,825 --> 01:19:59,817
God made me a witness
toitall

1504
01:19:59,962 --> 01:20:02,431
Or else, why would I go to buy
coconuts then?

1505
01:20:02,531 --> 01:20:03,828
You tell me

1506
01:20:03,966 --> 01:20:05,092
Yes, that's a point

1507
01:20:05,234 --> 01:20:06,224
And another thing is

1508
01:20:06,335 --> 01:20:07,894
he never speaks to me

1509
01:20:08,037 --> 01:20:09,061
But today he did

1510
01:20:09,204 --> 01:20:10,069
Why?

1511
01:20:10,205 --> 01:20:11,832
He's hiding something

1512
01:20:11,974 --> 01:20:14,466
Call Rajan and find out
where they're

1513
01:20:14,877 --> 01:20:16,311
Why should I, sir, you

1514
01:20:16,412 --> 01:20:18,073
If we call, he won't reveal
anything to us

1515
01:20:18,213 --> 01:20:19,942
It's better that you call

1516
01:20:20,082 --> 01:20:21,345
Just call

1517
01:20:21,450 --> 01:20:22,918
Okay

1518
01:20:26,021 --> 01:20:27,511
Rajan, this is Antony

1519
01:20:27,623 --> 01:20:29,113
[Rajan] Tell me, Antony

1520
01:20:29,258 --> 01:20:31,852
I called you several times
about my house repair

1521
01:20:31,994 --> 01:20:33,462
But you've done
nothing so far

1522
01:20:33,562 --> 01:20:34,791
Please do something

1523
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:38,161
- [Rajan] I'll send someone tomorrow
- Okay, one more thing

1524
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:39,597
Rajan

1525
01:20:39,935 --> 01:20:42,529
Don't send that Suni
I've an issue with him

1526
01:20:42,638 --> 01:20:44,072
Ask about others

1527
01:20:44,206 --> 01:20:45,605
[Rajan] He'll not work with me again

1528
01:20:45,908 --> 01:20:47,899
He begged me to
come to work

1529
01:20:48,110 --> 01:20:50,272
Later they disappeared
all of them

1530
01:20:50,379 --> 01:20:52,313
Ask him when they left

1531
01:20:54,083 --> 01:20:55,881
When did they leave?

1532
01:20:56,018 --> 01:20:57,144
I don't know

1533
01:20:57,286 --> 01:20:59,084
There's something wrong

1534
01:20:59,221 --> 01:21:00,950
They acted strange

1535
01:21:01,090 --> 01:21:02,421
Okay, I'll call later

1536
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:04,322
Please do the repairs

1537
01:21:04,426 --> 01:21:05,916
What did he say?

1538
01:21:07,162 --> 01:21:09,221
Our doubts are not misplaced

1539
01:21:09,431 --> 01:21:11,229
Rajan swore at him

1540
01:21:12,468 --> 01:21:14,903
They fled the worksite together

1541
01:21:15,037 --> 01:21:16,527
He's a callous fellow

1542
01:21:16,638 --> 01:21:17,833
True criminal

1543
01:21:17,973 --> 01:21:19,964
I'm sure he killed her

1544
01:21:20,342 --> 01:21:22,470
and drowned her in there

1545
01:21:24,313 --> 01:21:26,304
Otherwise, I wouldn't have
seen him here

1546
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:42,030
There

1547
01:21:44,666 --> 01:21:46,134
What?

1548
01:21:51,974 --> 01:21:53,271
Pachu?

1549
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:06,088
What?

1550
01:22:06,288 --> 01:22:08,620
Would you like to come home for tea?

1551
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:10,323
When your wife is back after delivery

1552
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:11,951
I'll come to see your baby

1553
01:22:12,094 --> 01:22:13,084
Jessy

1554
01:22:13,228 --> 01:22:15,697
I've something to tell you

1555
01:22:16,064 --> 01:22:18,192
What's the matter with you?

1556
01:22:19,001 --> 01:22:20,298
What?

1557
01:22:20,969 --> 01:22:23,131
I like you a lot, Jessy

1558
01:22:23,272 --> 01:22:25,639
What exactly do you like
about Jessy?

1559
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:26,999
You are a disgrace to men

1560
01:22:27,142 --> 01:22:28,109
Go away

1561
01:22:28,243 --> 01:22:29,176
Jessy, just once --

1562
01:22:29,311 --> 01:22:31,302
If you take a step forward
I'll smash your face

1563
01:22:31,413 --> 01:22:32,437
I know I'm no saint

1564
01:22:32,548 --> 01:22:33,481
Calm down

1565
01:22:33,582 --> 01:22:35,346
But I don't sleep with
married men around

1566
01:22:35,451 --> 01:22:37,476
I don't break families

1567
01:22:38,253 --> 01:22:39,550
Jessy, money --

1568
01:22:40,289 --> 01:22:41,450
To hell with your money

1569
01:22:41,557 --> 01:22:43,548
Do you want to get one
with this?

1570
01:22:45,527 --> 01:22:47,325
This is Jessy's sandal

1571
01:22:47,429 --> 01:22:49,193
Kurian

1572
01:22:50,165 --> 01:22:51,291
Are you sure?

1573
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:52,697
Yes, I'm sure

1574
01:22:55,037 --> 01:22:58,098
- Are you sure?
- Yes, both parties are in my ward

1575
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:00,038
- What parties?
- Jessy and Suni

1576
01:23:00,175 --> 01:23:01,973
The other party is waiting outside

1577
01:23:02,211 --> 01:23:04,111
You can ask him yourself

1578
01:23:04,246 --> 01:23:06,374
-Canl call him?
- Okay

1579
01:23:06,482 --> 01:23:08,211
Bring me the curry

1580
01:23:10,118 --> 01:23:11,415
Kurian, come in

1581
01:23:15,457 --> 01:23:17,255
Member told me about it

1582
01:23:17,426 --> 01:23:18,951
What's the issue between
you and her?

1583
01:23:19,094 --> 01:23:20,027
Nothing at all

1584
01:23:20,162 --> 01:23:21,323
They're related

1585
01:23:21,430 --> 01:23:22,989
Distantly related

1586
01:23:25,234 --> 01:23:26,531
Our families are at odds

1587
01:23:27,769 --> 01:23:30,363
I am a decent man
from a good family

1588
01:23:30,472 --> 01:23:31,997
If you ask me about Jessy

1589
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:34,040
Her comings and goings
are shady

1590
01:23:34,176 --> 01:23:35,268
- Right?
-Yes, yes

1591
01:23:35,377 --> 01:23:37,175
So that's the issue here?

1592
01:23:37,312 --> 01:23:38,609
Not just that

1593
01:23:38,747 --> 01:23:40,374
Once she'd a letter from society

1594
01:23:40,482 --> 01:23:42,974
When I went to her place
to tell her about it

1595
01:23:43,118 --> 01:23:45,212
She swore at me
and left

1596
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:47,618
Did you say something back
or hit her?

1597
01:23:47,756 --> 01:23:48,780
No, I didn't

1598
01:23:49,091 --> 01:23:52,425
When she said things about me
my wife gave it back to her

1599
01:23:52,528 --> 01:23:53,791
You didn't see her after that?

1600
01:23:54,096 --> 01:23:55,120
So she's missing

1601
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:56,663
President, this is a clean
missing case

1602
01:23:56,798 --> 01:23:58,391
He'll file a complaint
with police

1603
01:23:58,500 --> 01:23:59,661
or he'll be in trouble

1604
01:23:59,801 --> 01:24:00,791
Why should I go
to police?

1605
01:24:01,103 --> 01:24:02,264
- You should
- [Prakash] Yes

1606
01:24:02,371 --> 01:24:04,396
Otherwise you'll be
in trouble

1607
01:24:05,207 --> 01:24:07,403
But if go to the police
I'll be trapped

1608
01:24:07,509 --> 01:24:10,137
- What for?
-You'll be trapped, if you don't

1609
01:24:10,279 --> 01:24:13,442
Once they're after you
don't come crying for help

1610
01:24:14,583 --> 01:24:17,382
We're here to help you
Don't worry

1611
01:24:18,587 --> 01:24:20,521
Kurian, trust president

1612
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:22,649
You go to police
That's the correct way

1613
01:24:22,791 --> 01:24:23,758
You go how

1614
01:24:24,059 --> 01:24:25,390
Carry on

1615
01:24:27,696 --> 01:24:29,824
1 got news from their committee

1616
01:24:30,132 --> 01:24:32,157
Annamma is back in the game

1617
01:24:32,301 --> 01:24:34,633
They're planning a hartal
to stop the quarry

1618
01:24:34,770 --> 01:24:35,794
Any problem?

1619
01:24:36,104 --> 01:24:37,503
We should work hard

1620
01:24:39,341 --> 01:24:43,335
- When do bombs fall on borders?
- Are you planning to call the army?

1621
01:24:45,514 --> 01:24:48,347
Prakash, we can't get going
without fire and smoke

1622
01:24:50,352 --> 01:24:52,753
On the shores of —
Once more

1623
01:24:53,655 --> 01:24:55,851
A string of accidents is turning
this place

1624
01:24:56,158 --> 01:24:58,456
into a valley of mystery

1625
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:01,791
The disappearance of a woman
is the latest in the series

1626
01:25:04,333 --> 01:25:06,301
Valley means riverbank, right?

1627
01:25:06,401 --> 01:25:08,529
- But "Thaazhvaaram" movie is a forest
- Forest?

1628
01:25:08,637 --> 01:25:10,537
Or maybe there's a river too

1629
01:25:10,639 --> 01:25:12,107
Yes, there's a river

1630
01:25:12,207 --> 01:25:14,539
I'll step down
You get a wide shot

1631
01:25:14,643 --> 01:25:16,372
What's he doing?

1632
01:25:17,613 --> 01:25:19,081
Hey you

1633
01:25:19,214 --> 01:25:21,683
There's a hole after mining sand
You want to die or what?

1634
01:25:23,819 --> 01:25:25,287
That'll do

1635
01:25:26,221 --> 01:25:27,586
Little sambar curry

1636
01:25:27,723 --> 01:25:29,191
Enough

1637
01:25:30,192 --> 01:25:31,887
Brother, an Idea

1638
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:33,594

1639
01:25:37,132 --> 01:25:38,600
- Where's Suni?
- He's not at home

1640
01:25:38,734 --> 01:25:40,327
He owes me Rupee70

1641
01:25:40,602 --> 01:25:42,900
I'm tired of asking him
Give me if you've

1642
01:25:45,474 --> 01:25:46,873
You give me Rupee20 card

1643
01:25:47,275 --> 01:25:49,744
Keep Rupee40 with you
You can get the rest from Suni

1644
01:25:58,453 --> 01:26:00,285
Where is Karachira colony?

1645
01:26:00,422 --> 01:26:01,685
That way

1646
01:26:02,224 --> 01:26:04,716
Is that where masons live?
Yes, that's the place

1647
01:26:30,218 --> 01:26:32,186
Hello Kochacha
Is Suni there?

1648
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:33,947
[Karuppaayi] Yes, he's with me

1649
01:26:35,557 --> 01:26:37,855
Call for you
from home

1650
01:26:39,895 --> 01:26:41,329
Yes

1651
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:45,495
I've been calling from morning
Can't you ever call back?

1652
01:26:45,834 --> 01:26:47,859
Why make me walk on fire?

1653
01:26:48,003 --> 01:26:49,835
Must be drunk by now

1654
01:26:49,938 --> 01:26:51,929
Hey, I'm sober today

1655
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:54,436
Even the child hasn't eaten

1656
01:26:54,576 --> 01:26:56,567
If you want to scold
do it in person

1657
01:26:57,979 --> 01:27:00,277
We're planning something big

1658
01:27:00,515 --> 01:27:02,813
I'll tell you when I'm home
You get lunch ready

1659
01:27:05,954 --> 01:27:07,319
What's it?

1660
01:27:07,456 --> 01:27:09,857
My daughter's birthday
I've to go for lunch

1661
01:27:10,292 --> 01:27:11,987
- She's waiting
- I'll go with you

1662
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:13,557
Then we'll go with you
Thaamara?

1663
01:27:13,662 --> 01:27:16,188
You've to shift the things
after sunset

1664
01:27:16,331 --> 01:27:18,265
We should start selling
from tomorrow

1665
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:20,864
I've told driver Reji about it
He'll help us

1666
01:27:20,969 --> 01:27:23,370
Why did you tell Reji -

1667
01:27:23,672 --> 01:27:25,640
We'll talk to those
who queue up

1668
01:27:25,774 --> 01:27:27,299
outside beverage shops

1669
01:27:27,442 --> 01:27:29,410
We can make easy cash

1670
01:27:30,345 --> 01:27:32,712
We'll share the money equally
after we've sold out

1671
01:27:32,814 --> 01:27:35,010
- Or there'll be nothing in the end
- That's right

1672
01:27:35,317 --> 01:27:36,842
That'll do

1673
01:27:36,952 --> 01:27:38,681
So I'll take off

1674
01:27:39,454 --> 01:27:41,354
It's charged out again

1675
01:27:41,456 --> 01:27:43,891
- Hello
- [Prakash] Brother, member Prakash here

1676
01:27:43,992 --> 01:27:46,461

-Yes

1677
01:27:46,595 --> 01:27:47,892
Okay

1678
01:27:48,764 --> 01:27:50,528
It's member

1679
01:27:51,333 --> 01:27:52,630
What's it, member?

1680
01:27:52,768 --> 01:27:54,293
Where are you now?

1681
01:27:54,436 --> 01:27:56,700
I'm at...
I'm here

1682
01:27:56,805 --> 01:27:58,239
Is there any problem?

1683
01:27:58,373 --> 01:27:59,534
What problem?

1684
01:27:59,641 --> 01:28:00,904
What did you guys do?

1685
01:28:01,009 --> 01:28:02,568
Police are after you

1686
01:28:03,078 --> 01:28:04,409
(exclaims)
What?

1687
01:28:04,513 --> 01:28:05,503
Why?

1688
01:28:05,614 --> 01:28:06,547
Don't you know why?

1689
01:28:06,681 --> 01:28:07,910
What's there to know?

1690
01:28:08,016 --> 01:28:10,041
Don't try to be smart
Everybody knows

1691
01:28:10,318 --> 01:28:11,911
You'll be screwed
you know that

1692
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:13,545
What can we do?

1693
01:28:13,655 --> 01:28:16,386
There's nothing much to do
Police'll nab you soon

1694
01:28:16,525 --> 01:28:18,619
How did you know about it?

1695
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:20,922
So there's some truth in it

1696
01:28:21,630 --> 01:28:23,029
Sunil?

1697
01:28:23,732 --> 01:28:26,929
We'll help you out
President has agreed

1698
01:28:27,469 --> 01:28:29,528
He's here
You talk to him

1699
01:28:31,106 --> 01:28:32,574
Yes, president?

1700
01:28:32,674 --> 01:28:33,869
- What?
- (whispers)

1701
01:28:34,009 --> 01:28:36,501
If police find you out
you'll be done for

1702
01:28:36,645 --> 01:28:38,773
It's a non-bailable of fence

1703
01:28:39,881 --> 01:28:41,781
Go somewhere
for a few days

1704
01:28:41,883 --> 01:28:44,375
at least until this buzz
is over

1705
01:28:44,519 --> 01:28:45,816
Is that okay?

1706
01:28:45,921 --> 01:28:48,322
Police will track you down
using mobile tower

1707
01:28:48,423 --> 01:28:50,482
So don't call me
I'll be in trouble

1708
01:28:50,725 --> 01:28:52,989
Switch off your mobiles
and run off

1709
01:28:53,094 --> 01:28:54,755
Okay

1710
01:28:58,733 --> 01:29:00,394
Isn't it enough?

1711
01:29:03,672 --> 01:29:06,403
So it's true
Police are after us

1712
01:29:07,042 --> 01:29:09,636
President said we've to go away
for some days

1713
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:13,780
Is there anything else?

1714
01:29:13,915 --> 01:29:16,680
What else?
Will the bottles get washed away?

1715
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:20,822
No, I got a call earlier

1716
01:29:20,956 --> 01:29:22,117
It was about that Highway Jessy

1717
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:23,357
Forget about her

1718
01:29:23,491 --> 01:29:25,482
When we have our money
I can settle hers easily

1719
01:29:25,627 --> 01:29:27,493
Don't make a mountain
out of nothing

1720
01:29:28,964 --> 01:29:30,864
Anyway, switch off
your phones

1721
01:29:30,966 --> 01:29:33,094
President told so
We've to be careful

1722
01:29:34,469 --> 01:29:35,868
But where shall we go?

1723
01:29:37,572 --> 01:29:39,438
We'll do something

1724
01:29:43,745 --> 01:29:45,042
Sir

1725
01:29:45,847 --> 01:29:47,713
[Police] Prakash, why're you late?

1726
01:29:48,884 --> 01:29:50,409
This is her house

1727
01:29:50,518 --> 01:29:52,714
Two of you stay here
Don't let anybody in

1728
01:29:52,854 --> 01:29:54,515
Come, sir

1729
01:29:54,990 --> 01:29:57,015
You stay here
You two come with me

1730
01:30:07,736 --> 01:30:09,431
- Vijaya?
- Sir

1731
01:30:14,776 --> 01:30:16,972
Go and check if the backdoor
can be opened

1732
01:30:18,546 --> 01:30:20,605
What're you staring at?

1733
01:30:20,715 --> 01:30:22,080
Police

1734
01:30:22,851 --> 01:30:24,785
To hell with that woman

1735
01:30:27,188 --> 01:30:29,156
- President called the station, right?
- Yes, he did

1736
01:30:29,457 --> 01:30:31,619
He said he can't make it
as he's busy

1737
01:30:34,062 --> 01:30:35,621
Kuria?

1738
01:30:36,631 --> 01:30:37,792
You come here

1739
01:30:37,933 --> 01:30:38,832
Hey

1740
01:30:38,967 --> 01:30:41,629
Stay away from trouble
or you know what I'll do

1741
01:30:44,873 --> 01:30:46,534
You see that?

1742
01:30:46,641 --> 01:30:49,008
- It's good you complained, right?
-Yes

1743
01:31:08,897 --> 01:31:10,922
-Who made the complaint?
- He was here

1744
01:31:11,032 --> 01:31:12,659
Kuria?

1745
01:31:14,235 --> 01:31:15,168
Kurian?

1746
01:31:15,470 --> 01:31:16,198
Yes, sir

1747
01:31:16,504 --> 01:31:17,596
Is this Jessy?

1748
01:31:17,706 --> 01:31:18,673
Yes, that's Jessy

1749
01:31:18,773 --> 01:31:20,741
This was taken on
her engagement day

1750
01:31:20,875 --> 01:31:21,808
It's an old one

1751
01:31:21,910 --> 01:31:23,207
Do you've a new one?

1752
01:31:23,511 --> 01:31:24,637
No, I don't

1753
01:31:24,779 --> 01:31:26,076
Where does Jessy work?

1754
01:31:28,116 --> 01:31:30,710
Don't you see sir's asking you?
Answer him

1755
01:31:31,052 --> 01:31:33,521
Sirsheis a...
..hot a decent job

1756
01:31:33,655 --> 01:31:35,851
Sir, she's known
as Highway Jessy

1757
01:31:36,124 --> 01:31:38,650
She had shady deals
with truck drivers

1758
01:31:39,928 --> 01:31:41,259
Sir, prosecution

1759
01:31:49,604 --> 01:31:51,094
Where is Suni's house?

1760
01:31:51,239 --> 01:31:52,468
There

1761
01:31:52,607 --> 01:31:53,665
Is he there?

1762
01:31:53,775 --> 01:31:56,039
I saw him last on TV

1763
01:32:00,648 --> 01:32:02,582
Pass that bottle
I'll show you

1764
01:32:04,085 --> 01:32:05,553
Give it to me
See, police

1765
01:32:08,623 --> 01:32:09,920
Anybody in?

1766
01:32:15,663 --> 01:32:17,495
Does anyone of you live here?

1767
01:32:17,632 --> 01:32:19,191
He is calling you

1768
01:32:20,168 --> 01:32:21,636
Go

1769
01:32:23,171 --> 01:32:24,969
Do you live here?

1770
01:32:25,573 --> 01:32:26,631
Yes

1771
01:32:26,741 --> 01:32:28,140
Where is your father?

1772
01:32:28,810 --> 01:32:30,209
Tell me where he is

1773
01:32:30,345 --> 01:32:31,506
Mother

1774
01:32:31,646 --> 01:32:32,772
Hey

1775
01:32:32,881 --> 01:32:35,179
Why're you crying?
I just asked for your father

1776
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:36,517
Mother

1777
01:32:36,651 --> 01:32:37,675
What?

1778
01:32:37,786 --> 01:32:39,083
Mother

1779
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:40,654
Ask her

1780
01:32:42,090 --> 01:32:43,649
Why are you crying, dear?

1781
01:32:43,825 --> 01:32:45,020
Tell us where your father is

1782
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:46,184
I don't know

1783
01:32:46,327 --> 01:32:47,522
Tell us, dear

1784
01:32:47,662 --> 01:32:48,959
Mother

1785
01:32:49,097 --> 01:32:50,565
My child

1786
01:32:53,735 --> 01:32:55,794
So you were hiding?

1787
01:32:55,904 --> 01:32:57,531
There is something wrong

1788
01:32:57,672 --> 01:32:58,639
Where is your husband?

1789
01:32:58,740 --> 01:33:00,230
Sir, he is not here

1790
01:33:00,809 --> 01:33:02,106
Suresh

1791
01:33:04,746 --> 01:33:06,111
Tell me where he is

1792
01:33:06,247 --> 01:33:07,908
He went to my house

1793
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:10,017
When did he leave?

1794
01:33:10,151 --> 01:33:11,277
Early morning

1795
01:33:11,586 --> 01:33:12,849
And not yet home?

1796
01:33:12,954 --> 01:33:14,319
Sir, what's the matter?

1797
01:33:14,622 --> 01:33:15,919
Any problem?

1798
01:33:16,591 --> 01:33:19,356
If you're hiding him
you'll be in trouble

1799
01:33:23,631 --> 01:33:24,757
It's nothing, dear

1800
01:33:24,866 --> 01:33:26,163
Sir, he's not here

1801
01:33:31,406 --> 01:33:32,931
Did he call you?

1802
01:33:33,341 --> 01:33:34,706
No, sir

1803
01:33:34,809 --> 01:33:35,742
He didn't call?

1804
01:33:35,844 --> 01:33:36,777
No

1805
01:33:36,878 --> 01:33:38,346
Do you have a phone?

1806
01:33:45,153 --> 01:33:47,588
Report to us when he's back

1807
01:33:47,689 --> 01:33:50,090
Otherwise everyone gets
locked up

1808
01:33:52,393 --> 01:33:53,861
Move aside

1809
01:34:16,217 --> 01:34:17,207
Kochachan, do you remember?

1810
01:34:17,352 --> 01:34:18,820
The house owner wanted us

1811
01:34:18,920 --> 01:34:21,184
to build a swimming pool at the centre

1812
01:34:21,656 --> 01:34:23,215
Only God knows where he is?

1813
01:34:23,391 --> 01:34:24,688
Be careful

1814
01:34:24,792 --> 01:34:26,351
Kochachan, it's your turn

1815
01:34:30,131 --> 01:34:31,428
Start the game

1816
01:34:34,068 --> 01:34:35,900
If you don't want to play
don't play

1817
01:34:45,213 --> 01:34:46,840
Enough
You have it

1818
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:52,987
Suni brother

1819
01:34:53,121 --> 01:34:54,987
What's it with the police?

1820
01:34:55,423 --> 01:34:57,858
The whole village stole
bottles from there

1821
01:34:57,959 --> 01:34:59,358
Then what's the big deal?

1822
01:34:59,727 --> 01:35:00,853
Yes, that's a point

1823
01:35:00,962 --> 01:35:02,293
Don't know how the news spread

1824
01:35:02,430 --> 01:35:03,693
No clue

1825
01:35:03,798 --> 01:35:05,323
Because you couldn't keep
your mouth shut

1826
01:35:05,466 --> 01:35:06,865
No, I didn't tell anybody

1827
01:35:06,968 --> 01:35:08,959
I think it's that
teashop owner Antony

1828
01:35:09,070 --> 01:35:10,333
He saw us there

1829
01:35:10,471 --> 01:35:11,700
Who knows?

1830
01:35:11,806 --> 01:35:13,137
I'm worried

1831
01:35:13,274 --> 01:35:15,072
Next month I'll receive
my passport

1832
01:35:15,276 --> 01:35:17,335
If I don't go abroad
my life will be ruined

1833
01:35:17,912 --> 01:35:20,813
There's nothing that
money can't solve

1834
01:35:20,915 --> 01:35:22,781
Don't think too much

1835
01:35:23,151 --> 01:35:24,084
Because

1836
01:35:24,219 --> 01:35:25,152
My sister...

1837
01:35:25,286 --> 01:35:27,448
I've some commitments
to my brother-in-law

1838
01:35:28,456 --> 01:35:30,925
Don't be emotional

1839
01:35:31,192 --> 01:35:32,682
Let's sell the liquor first

1840
01:35:32,794 --> 01:35:34,421
That money will solve
your problems

1841
01:35:36,731 --> 01:35:38,028
Leave it

1842
01:35:43,838 --> 01:35:45,704
Stop police inaction

1843
01:35:47,242 --> 01:35:48,835
Police serve us justice

1844
01:35:49,043 --> 01:35:50,977
Arrest Jessy's killer

1845
01:35:51,779 --> 01:35:53,269
Stop police inaction

1846
01:35:53,414 --> 01:35:54,506
[S.1] Stop it

1847
01:35:54,782 --> 01:35:55,772
Police serve us justice

1848
01:35:55,883 --> 01:35:56,873
[S.1] Stop it

1849
01:35:56,985 --> 01:35:58,214
Police stop foul play

1850
01:35:58,353 --> 01:35:59,252
[S.1.] Hey, stop it

1851
01:35:59,387 --> 01:36:00,320
James, don't make it worse

1852
01:36:00,421 --> 01:36:01,388
Sir, don't worry

1853
01:36:01,522 --> 01:36:02,990
I'll manage

1854
01:36:03,458 --> 01:36:04,823
Everybody sit down

1855
01:36:04,926 --> 01:36:06,155
Sit down

1856
01:36:06,294 --> 01:36:07,352
Sir, any problem?

1857
01:36:07,495 --> 01:36:09,020
Don't bother they will
deal with it

1858
01:36:09,163 --> 01:36:10,460
Hold properly

1859
01:36:10,565 --> 01:36:11,964
Arrest the killer

1860
01:36:12,066 --> 01:36:13,363
Calm down

1861
01:36:13,534 --> 01:36:14,933
Dear friends

1862
01:36:15,036 --> 01:36:17,403
Whatever happened
was a shocking crime

1863
01:36:17,538 --> 01:36:18,937
Jessy's disappearance

1864
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:20,337
shook the entire village

1865
01:36:21,142 --> 01:36:22,507
Due to police inaction

1866
01:36:23,311 --> 01:36:25,803
murders have turned into
a daily event

1867
01:36:25,913 --> 01:36:28,041
We can't remain silent
anymore

1868
01:36:28,216 --> 01:36:29,479
Until the killer is arrested

1869
01:36:29,584 --> 01:36:31,848
we'll continue with the protest

1870
01:36:31,953 --> 01:36:33,819
Inquilab zindaabad

1871
01:36:34,289 --> 01:36:36,815
-Inquilab zindaabad
- (crowd cheers)

1872
01:36:37,425 --> 01:36:39,257
Arrest Jessy's killer

1873
01:36:39,394 --> 01:36:40,862
(crowd cheers)

1874
01:36:44,966 --> 01:36:46,263
Antony?
Yes

1875
01:36:48,903 --> 01:36:50,234
Come to the police station

1876
01:36:50,371 --> 01:36:51,497
S.1. wants to see you

1877
01:36:51,606 --> 01:36:52,573
I'll be there

1878
01:36:52,840 --> 01:36:54,137
Sir, have some tea
No

1879
01:36:57,278 --> 01:36:58,973
What will I do now?

1880
01:36:59,180 --> 01:37:02,047
I told you to mind
your own business

1881
01:37:03,618 --> 01:37:05,245
We should tell what we saw

1882
01:37:05,386 --> 01:37:06,876
I saw Suni that day

1883
01:37:06,988 --> 01:37:09,286
Divakaran is not ready to talk

1884
01:37:10,091 --> 01:37:11,149
As they call me

1885
01:37:11,292 --> 01:37:12,817
Police will summon you too

1886
01:37:13,261 --> 01:37:14,956
Don't mess with me

1887
01:37:15,163 --> 01:37:16,324
Take my credit
Here's Rupee96

1888
01:37:16,464 --> 01:37:17,488
Keep the balance
with you

1889
01:37:17,598 --> 01:37:18,929
I'll never come here again

1890
01:37:19,067 --> 01:37:20,262
Hey Divakara

1891
01:37:20,368 --> 01:37:21,301
Crooked guy

1892
01:37:21,436 --> 01:37:22,528
Sister, what's the matter?

1893
01:37:22,637 --> 01:37:24,571
Mind your own business

1894
01:37:25,340 --> 01:37:26,808
Divakaran, stop there

1895
01:37:34,482 --> 01:37:36,109
Where did you get this from?

1896
01:37:38,519 --> 01:37:40,283
I found it outside

1897
01:37:42,323 --> 01:37:43,984
My stomach is upset

1898
01:37:44,425 --> 01:37:46,086
My stomach is empty

1899
01:37:46,327 --> 01:37:48,125
so I don't have a problem

1900
01:37:48,930 --> 01:37:49,954
Are you hungry?

1901
01:37:50,064 --> 01:37:51,361
I'm starving

1902
01:37:52,100 --> 01:37:53,864
Shall we go outside?

1903
01:37:54,268 --> 01:37:55,565
It's not safe

1904
01:37:56,003 --> 01:37:57,596
What'll we do now?

1905
01:37:58,239 --> 01:37:59,331
Is there any tender coconut?

1906
01:37:59,474 --> 01:38:00,908
It's over

1907
01:38:03,511 --> 01:38:05,070
Suni brother, I'm starving

1908
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:06,970
I'm hungry too

1909
01:38:07,081 --> 01:38:09,277
When will this end?

1910
01:38:09,417 --> 01:38:10,942
It was foolish of us

1911
01:38:11,219 --> 01:38:12,914
Somebody has to end it

1912
01:38:14,188 --> 01:38:16,384
How did you solve the puzzle?

1913
01:38:16,591 --> 01:38:18,286
I tried several times

1914
01:38:18,493 --> 01:38:19,483
I just pulled the stickers

1915
01:38:19,594 --> 01:38:20,925
How?

1916
01:38:21,028 --> 01:38:23,156
I pulled the stickers
and pasted in order

1917
01:38:26,100 --> 01:38:27,397
-Run
- Karuppaayi

1918
01:38:36,277 --> 01:38:37,574
Stop there

1919
01:38:49,323 --> 01:38:50,620
Thaamara

1920
01:39:04,439 --> 01:39:06,066
Stop there, old man

1921
01:39:19,454 --> 01:39:20,717
Sir

1922
01:39:32,066 --> 01:39:33,363
You nasty

1923
01:39:35,536 --> 01:39:36,970
Sir, don't hit me

1924
01:39:37,071 --> 01:39:38,368
I've surrendered

1925
01:39:43,110 --> 01:39:44,407
Kochacha, they found you

1926
01:39:48,182 --> 01:39:49,479
Hello sir

1927
01:39:50,384 --> 01:39:51,681
Sir, slowly

1928
01:39:51,786 --> 01:39:53,254
Get in you --

1929
01:39:55,523 --> 01:39:57,992
Sir, don't leave
I want to go with you

1930
01:40:01,462 --> 01:40:02,361
Who are you?

1931
01:40:02,497 --> 01:40:03,589
I'm one of them

1932
01:40:03,698 --> 01:40:05,166
Get in

1933
01:40:09,203 --> 01:40:10,329
Why didn't you escape?

1934
01:40:10,471 --> 01:40:12,235
What will I do alone?

1935
01:40:22,517 --> 01:40:24,508
Don't say anything
about the bottles

1936
01:40:25,186 --> 01:40:26,483
Don't say anything

1937
01:40:27,088 --> 01:40:28,385
[S.l.] Come here

1938
01:40:28,656 --> 01:40:30,124
Everyone

1939
01:40:31,592 --> 01:40:33,424
Let sir have a good look
atyou

1940
01:40:35,263 --> 01:40:36,753
Need any tea, water or refreshments?

1941
01:40:37,031 --> 01:40:38,328
No thanks, sir

1942
01:40:41,435 --> 01:40:42,596
Suni

1943
01:40:42,703 --> 01:40:44,034
We've the evidence

1944
01:40:44,171 --> 01:40:45,070
Tell me the truth

1945
01:40:45,206 --> 01:40:46,105
We don't know anything

1946
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:47,173
We were busy with work

1947
01:40:47,308 --> 01:40:48,639
Where were you last night?

1948
01:40:48,743 --> 01:40:49,767
We were...

1949
01:40:50,044 --> 01:40:51,671
..at the warehouse

1950
01:40:52,813 --> 01:40:54,281
Okay

1951
01:40:55,316 --> 01:40:57,182
Do you stay there often?

1952
01:40:57,318 --> 01:40:58,615
Once in a while

1953
01:40:58,719 --> 01:41:00,653
Then why were you there
yesterday?

1954
01:41:01,689 --> 01:41:03,316
We passed out after drinking

1955
01:41:05,393 --> 01:41:06,292
What about the others?

1956
01:41:06,427 --> 01:41:07,758
We are coworkers

1957
01:41:14,068 --> 01:41:15,536
How many pegs do you have
usually?

1958
01:41:15,636 --> 01:41:17,104
What?

1959
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:20,107
How much do you drink?

1960
01:41:20,474 --> 01:41:21,635
Three pegs

1961
01:41:21,742 --> 01:41:23,210
Only three?

1962
01:41:24,111 --> 01:41:26,205
You seem like you can have
a full bottle

1963
01:41:26,714 --> 01:41:28,182
No sir

1964
01:41:29,317 --> 01:41:30,409
What about yesterday?

1965
01:41:30,551 --> 01:41:31,609
Yesterday

1966
01:41:31,719 --> 01:41:33,312
He'd six pegs
including mine

1967
01:41:33,588 --> 01:41:34,612
Not six

1968
01:41:34,722 --> 01:41:35,848
Five-and-a-half

1969
01:41:36,123 --> 01:41:37,818
Then you dozed off?

1970
01:41:41,429 --> 01:41:43,056
How many bottles did you have?

1971
01:41:43,664 --> 01:41:45,132
Three bottles

1972
01:41:47,335 --> 01:41:49,463
You can't even get
the peg count right

1973
01:41:49,604 --> 01:41:51,072
(Suni stutters)

1974
01:41:53,608 --> 01:41:56,873
Should we believe that you
went home straight away?

1975
01:42:00,414 --> 01:42:02,883
You guys don't deserve
to be treated well

1976
01:42:09,256 --> 01:42:10,815
Where did you hide it?

1977
01:42:13,694 --> 01:42:15,162
How did you kill Jesssy?

1978
01:42:15,463 --> 01:42:17,090
Sir, what do you mean?

1979
01:42:17,598 --> 01:42:18,622
Sir, we don't know anything

1980
01:42:18,733 --> 01:42:20,758
Did you smash her head
or hack her to death?

1981
01:42:20,868 --> 01:42:22,199
Sir, we know nothing
about it

1982
01:42:22,336 --> 01:42:23,667
Sir, we didn't kill anybody

1983
01:42:23,771 --> 01:42:26,172
We don't know, sir,
we're not lying

1984
01:42:26,307 --> 01:42:28,332
- We didn't
- (all speak at once)

1985
01:42:28,476 --> 01:42:30,240
We didn't kill anybody, sir

1986
01:42:32,580 --> 01:42:34,139
- Vijaya?
- [Vijayan] Sir?

1987
01:42:34,281 --> 01:42:35,476
Ask them properly

1988
01:42:35,616 --> 01:42:36,777
Where did you hide
the body?

1989
01:42:36,884 --> 01:42:38,409
We know nothing, sir

1990
01:42:38,552 --> 01:42:40,611
Which side of the bridge?
This or that?

1991
01:42:40,721 --> 01:42:42,780
Sir, we're telling the truth
We don't know

1992
01:42:44,291 --> 01:42:45,349
Tell me the truth

1993
01:42:45,493 --> 01:42:46,585
We don't know, sir

1994
01:42:46,694 --> 01:42:47,661
Take them inside

1995
01:42:47,762 --> 01:42:49,230
Get in

1996
01:42:49,930 --> 01:42:51,659
-0 God
- 8ir, no

1997
01:42:51,766 --> 01:42:53,200
Please don't beat me

1998
01:42:53,334 --> 01:42:54,824
- Sir, no sir
- Please sir

1999
01:42:54,935 --> 01:42:56,562
Please don't do this

2000
01:43:02,977 --> 01:43:04,672
Where did you drown her?

2001
01:43:04,779 --> 01:43:06,247
Sir, we don't know

2002
01:43:06,380 --> 01:43:08,144
So you won't tell the truth?

2003
01:43:08,282 --> 01:43:10,649
Where did you dump her?

2004
01:43:11,352 --> 01:43:12,478
Sir, I don't know

2005
01:43:12,620 --> 01:43:14,349
Shut up

2006
01:43:14,555 --> 01:43:16,649
You'll tell me
Sir, no please don't

2007
01:43:16,757 --> 01:43:18,657
Sir, please leave him
He's innocent

2008
01:43:18,959 --> 01:43:20,859
- Sir, sir —
- Move back

2009
01:43:21,295 --> 01:43:22,592
Move back

2010
01:43:25,633 --> 01:43:27,260
Sir, no, he's innocent

2011
01:43:27,668 --> 01:43:29,432
- Sir
- Hands off

2012
01:43:30,705 --> 01:43:31,763
You dare stop me?

2013
01:43:31,872 --> 01:43:33,431
I don't know, sir

2014
01:43:34,542 --> 01:43:36,408
Who killed her?
Was it you?

2015
01:43:36,911 --> 01:43:38,936
You drowned her --

2016
01:43:39,346 --> 01:43:40,643
Vijaya?

2017
01:43:42,249 --> 01:43:44,183
Vijaya, stop it

2018
01:43:45,252 --> 01:43:47,414
That's enough
You move back

2019
01:43:48,255 --> 01:43:50,815
Is this how you interrogate?
Check if he's alright

2020
01:43:51,292 --> 01:43:53,226
You come with me
I've a family too

2021
01:43:53,394 --> 01:43:55,658
I can't be answerable to this

2022
01:43:55,796 --> 01:43:57,525
Let's go inside

2023
01:44:00,701 --> 01:44:02,863
Please take him
to a hospital

2024
01:44:03,971 --> 01:44:05,905
Hey, check this out

2025
01:44:07,875 --> 01:44:10,936
We've CCTV visuals of them
on the bridge in the morning

2026
01:44:12,246 --> 01:44:14,214
Then the other guy
that short one

2027
01:44:14,415 --> 01:44:15,712
Thaamara

2028
01:44:16,751 --> 01:44:18,685
It's clear they came
in a carriage van

2029
01:44:18,786 --> 01:44:20,811
Have you found the driver?

2030
01:44:21,288 --> 01:44:22,983
We'll get him today, sir

2031
01:44:24,625 --> 01:44:26,719
Call details explain it all

2032
01:44:28,329 --> 01:44:29,956
Suni killed her

2033
01:44:30,664 --> 01:44:33,258
So he called his friends
to dispose the body

2034
01:44:33,601 --> 01:44:35,660
All the calls were made
from his phone

2035
01:44:37,271 --> 01:44:39,035
- Send a mail to dog squad
- [constable] Okay sir

2036
01:44:39,340 --> 01:44:40,739
They've to be here by morning

2037
01:44:44,345 --> 01:44:45,676
Vijaya

2038
01:44:46,814 --> 01:44:48,873
But there's one glitch
We've to find the body

2039
01:44:48,983 --> 01:44:50,815
Else we can't proceed

2040
01:44:52,586 --> 01:44:54,953
Sir, the teashop guy saw bloodstains
oh Suni's shirt

2041
01:44:56,524 --> 01:44:58,652
If we get the shirt to forensics
the case is solved

2042
01:44:58,759 --> 01:45:00,352
An open-and-shut case

2043
01:45:01,095 --> 01:45:03,257
You trace that driver

2044
01:45:03,964 --> 01:45:05,659
Don't do it again

2045
01:45:06,567 --> 01:45:08,467
- Alright sir
- Okay

2046
01:45:08,769 --> 01:45:10,066
Vijaya

2047
01:45:10,538 --> 01:45:12,632
Be sensible
not sensitive

2048
01:45:13,607 --> 01:45:15,302
Sorry sir

2049
01:45:19,313 --> 01:45:21,941
Sir, this man took in my son
to teach driving

2050
01:45:22,383 --> 01:45:24,351
Then he abused the boy

2051
01:45:24,485 --> 01:45:25,646
Who is he?
Where does he live?

2052
01:45:25,753 --> 01:45:26,845
On the bund road

2053
01:45:26,954 --> 01:45:28,752
When I asked about it
he tried to hit me

2054
01:45:28,856 --> 01:45:29,982
He's drunk

2055
01:45:30,124 --> 01:45:31,592
Prakash

2056
01:45:32,893 --> 01:45:35,555
- Yes sir?
- Let's go check this out

2057
01:45:36,463 --> 01:45:38,329
Prashant, come down

2058
01:45:38,465 --> 01:45:40,331
Prashant, keep watch

2059
01:45:58,419 --> 01:45:59,716
When did you
change the shirt?

2060
01:45:59,820 --> 01:46:01,652
At the warehouse
this morning

2061
01:46:02,823 --> 01:46:05,121
- What did you do with it?
-1 dumped it

2062
01:46:05,593 --> 01:46:07,118
- Where?
- At the same place

2063
01:46:08,495 --> 01:46:09,792
Why?

2064
01:46:10,464 --> 01:46:12,558
Kochacha, it had
bloodstains

2065
01:46:12,700 --> 01:46:13,997
You rascal

2066
01:46:14,168 --> 01:46:16,466
You were cheating us
all the while

2067
01:46:16,604 --> 01:46:17,833
Kochacha, why do you
say that?

2068
01:46:17,938 --> 01:46:19,702
You've ruined our lives

2069
01:46:20,374 --> 01:46:21,864
ol -
- He's a liar

2070
01:46:21,976 --> 01:46:23,842
He used liquor as a bait
to trap us

2071
01:46:23,944 --> 01:46:26,845
Her body might be in one
of the sacks we dumped

2072
01:46:28,482 --> 01:46:30,712
I trusted you
but you lied

2073
01:46:30,918 --> 01:46:33,114
(all shouting at once)

2074
01:46:34,455 --> 01:46:35,718
(policeman) What's happening there?

2075
01:46:35,823 --> 01:46:37,120
You better be quiet

2076
01:47:29,043 --> 01:47:31,569
- Where's the little one?
- Sleeping

2077
01:47:33,881 --> 01:47:35,679
We don't want you
to stay alone

2078
01:47:35,950 --> 01:47:38,942
We've enough at home
for the two of you

2079
01:47:39,086 --> 01:47:40,884
We can stay at our home
Let's go

2080
01:47:43,590 --> 01:47:45,957
-1 don't want to go
- We're not giving you a choice

2081
01:47:46,093 --> 01:47:48,494
Do you see where your choices
have led you?

2082
01:47:49,196 --> 01:47:51,597
We've been worrying about you
the last eight years

2083
01:47:51,732 --> 01:47:53,131
Enough is enough
Let's go

2084
01:47:54,268 --> 01:47:55,793
Our father suffered
after you left

2085
01:47:55,936 --> 01:47:57,836
until he died two months later

2086
01:48:02,576 --> 01:48:03,907
(clears throat)

2087
01:48:05,145 --> 01:48:07,671
I saw your car coming in
that's why I came

2088
01:48:09,249 --> 01:48:11,946
If it's a personal matter
then I'll --

2089
01:48:12,186 --> 01:48:14,211
We're here to take
our sister home

2090
01:48:16,991 --> 01:48:19,187
That'll be the right thing
to do now

2091
01:48:19,994 --> 01:48:21,723
Go home for a few days

2092
01:48:21,962 --> 01:48:24,124
Once she leaves
she'll not return

2093
01:48:25,599 --> 01:48:26,532
And if she does

2094
01:48:26,633 --> 01:48:28,101
we'll consider her dead

2095
01:48:28,202 --> 01:48:29,795
That's it

2096
01:48:30,804 --> 01:48:32,795
I'd helped him out

2097
01:48:32,906 --> 01:48:34,840
when he eloped with her

2098
01:48:35,109 --> 01:48:37,601
Later I realised that
it was a mistake

2099
01:48:37,878 --> 01:48:38,811
What shall I say?

2100
01:48:38,912 --> 01:48:40,277
It's up to you
to decide

2101
01:48:42,950 --> 01:48:44,577
So you're here too?

2102
01:48:44,852 --> 01:48:47,048
- What're you doing here?
- She has called her brothers

2103
01:48:47,154 --> 01:48:48,622
to save her husband

2104
01:48:49,156 --> 01:48:51,022
What about my boy?
Who'll help him?

2105
01:48:51,658 --> 01:48:53,524
- He'll be left to die
- You're mistaken --

2106
01:48:53,660 --> 01:48:55,628
I'm not mistaken
My boy was sleeping

2107
01:48:55,729 --> 01:48:57,254
Suni came home
and asked for him

2108
01:48:58,065 --> 01:48:59,260
I saw him leaving with Suni

2109
01:48:59,533 --> 01:49:01,763
- Do you know that?
- Be quiet

2110
01:49:01,902 --> 01:49:03,529
My boy has never lied to me

2111
01:49:03,637 --> 01:49:05,571
When I called him last night
he said a bunch of lies

2112
01:49:05,706 --> 01:49:06,673
Isn't that because of him?

2113
01:49:06,807 --> 01:49:07,865
What's with your father?

2114
01:49:07,975 --> 01:49:10,535
- Mother, you come here
- She is six months pregnant

2115
01:49:11,211 --> 01:49:13,771
He's not from around here
but he looked after us well

2116
01:49:13,914 --> 01:49:15,211
- Come here, mother
- Leave me alone

2117
01:49:15,315 --> 01:49:16,248
Take her home, child

2118
01:49:16,350 --> 01:49:17,613
Hey you, take your man home

2119
01:49:17,751 --> 01:49:19,719
Hey, we've heard enough
from you

2120
01:49:19,820 --> 01:49:21,948
-Why do you bother my husband?
- Now you've also come

2121
01:49:22,089 --> 01:49:24,023
- You go home
- This is my family matter

2122
01:49:24,158 --> 01:49:26,627
He was more a sonto me
than a son-in-law

2123
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:28,819
If anything happens to my boy...

2124
01:49:28,929 --> 01:49:30,897
You'll be doomed

2125
01:49:30,998 --> 01:49:32,523
You'll rot in hell

2126
01:49:32,666 --> 01:49:33,724
Let's go home

2127
01:49:33,867 --> 01:49:36,131
You can't solve the matter
by shouting at his wife

2128
01:49:36,270 --> 01:49:37,237
Go back, you

2129
01:49:37,371 --> 01:49:38,668
Go home with your daughter

2130
01:49:38,772 --> 01:49:40,900
- My girl won't have a man
- We won't let that happen

2131
01:49:41,008 --> 01:49:42,339
She'll end up just like me

2132
01:49:42,643 --> 01:49:44,008
What'll I do?

2133
01:49:44,311 --> 01:49:46,712
We'll come tomorrow
Be ready to go

2134
01:49:50,751 --> 01:49:52,048
Let's go

2135
01:50:06,700 --> 01:50:09,260
Like the morning flowers
that smile

2136
01:50:09,403 --> 01:50:12,304
And the paddy field wind
that beguiles

2137
01:50:13,674 --> 01:50:16,700
You spent days
fooling around with me

2138
01:50:19,880 --> 01:50:22,941
You got away
flapping my sari, you see

2139
01:50:26,019 --> 01:50:28,852
Like the morning flower
that smiles

2140
01:50:29,156 --> 01:50:32,148
And the paddy field wind
that beguiles

2141
01:50:32,326 --> 01:50:35,318
You spent days
fooling around with me

2142
01:50:38,966 --> 01:50:41,833
You got away
flapping my sari, you see

2143
01:51:10,898 --> 01:51:13,390
Lighting my way
with the sun departing

2144
01:51:13,700 --> 01:51:16,362
Streaking with kisses
my hair's middle parting

2145
01:51:17,738 --> 01:51:20,799
You caught the very air
I take

2146
01:51:23,710 --> 01:51:26,179
Lighting my way
with the sun departing

2147
01:51:26,280 --> 01:51:29,181
Streaking with kisses
my hair's middle parting

2148
01:51:30,184 --> 01:51:33,279
You caught the very air
I take

2149
01:51:36,790 --> 01:51:39,259
When a dart halts

2150
01:51:39,693 --> 01:51:42,162
the beat of my heart

2151
01:51:42,930 --> 01:51:46,025
I know you won't weep
or bid farewell

2152
01:51:49,403 --> 01:51:52,395
1 know I'm not in the stories
you

2153
01:52:04,151 --> 01:52:06,347
Why is the dog coming here?

2154
01:52:06,753 --> 01:52:08,050
Go away

2155
01:52:15,462 --> 01:52:17,396
When I told her
she didn't believe me

2156
01:52:17,531 --> 01:52:19,021
Now do you see?

2157
01:53:04,778 --> 01:53:06,075
(police) Go on

2158
01:53:19,359 --> 01:53:21,418
[Geetha voice-over]
Everyday you come home drunk...

2159
01:53:21,561 --> 01:53:24,531
People will laugh at me
if I say that I'm Suni's wife

2160
01:53:32,205 --> 01:53:33,764
[Geetha voice-over]
And your daughter?

2161
01:53:33,874 --> 01:53:35,808
Do you think she is proud of you?

2162
01:53:36,510 --> 01:53:38,808
Do you know what it means
to be respected?

2163
01:53:52,259 --> 01:53:54,853
(crowd) Sir, stop the vehicle
We want to take a look

2164
01:53:54,995 --> 01:53:57,487
(bus employee) Moonthal bus stop
Get off quickly

2165
01:53:59,299 --> 01:54:01,267
(crowd hoots)

2166
01:54:07,507 --> 01:54:09,134
Sir, there's Suni

2167
01:54:24,958 --> 01:54:26,357
Thaamara?

2168
01:54:26,593 --> 01:54:27,617
What happened?

2169
01:54:27,894 --> 01:54:28,884
I don't know

2170
01:54:29,029 --> 01:54:30,394
You go

2171
01:54:38,405 --> 01:54:40,100
President, there she goes

2172
01:54:41,508 --> 01:54:43,033
Jessy

2173
01:54:43,410 --> 01:54:44,571
Jessy

2174
01:54:44,678 --> 01:54:46,237
Jessy is here

2175
01:54:47,247 --> 01:54:48,874
She's not dead?

2176
01:54:49,583 --> 01:54:52,109
(Jessy) Haven't you seen me before?

2177
01:54:56,423 --> 01:54:57,948
Sir, please stop

2178
01:54:58,625 --> 01:54:59,592
Please stop the van

2179
01:54:59,893 --> 01:55:01,224
Stop it

2180
01:55:01,328 --> 01:55:03,387
Sir, there goes the woman
1 killed

2181
01:55:05,132 --> 01:55:06,031
Jessy

2182
01:55:06,133 --> 01:55:07,601
Where were you?

2183
01:55:08,902 --> 01:55:09,630
There's a letter for you

2184
01:55:09,936 --> 01:55:11,927
You should collect it
from the office

2185
01:55:12,472 --> 01:55:13,530
Sir is calling you

2186
01:55:13,673 --> 01:55:14,663
What for?

2187
01:55:14,941 --> 01:55:16,375
He will tell you
Come here

2188
01:55:20,247 --> 01:55:21,681
It's turned upside down

2189
01:55:22,482 --> 01:55:23,449
Move aside

2190
01:55:23,583 --> 01:55:25,108
Make way for her

2191
01:55:25,218 --> 01:55:26,515
Sir, what's the problem?

2192
01:55:29,322 --> 01:55:30,221
Are you Jessy?

2193
01:55:30,323 --> 01:55:31,620
Yes

2194
01:55:33,727 --> 01:55:35,320
You were Kill...

2195
01:55:36,696 --> 01:55:38,425
Where were you?

2196
01:55:39,132 --> 01:55:40,896
I was away
for a personal matter

2197
01:55:43,103 --> 01:55:44,127
Get into the van

2198
01:55:44,271 --> 01:55:45,636
There is a missing case

2199
01:55:45,739 --> 01:55:46,934
What's it?

2200
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:48,508
Someone has reported
that you were missing

2201
01:55:48,642 --> 01:55:49,609
So get into the van

2202
01:55:49,709 --> 01:55:50,642
What? Me?

2203
01:55:50,744 --> 01:55:51,711
Vijaya?

2204
01:55:51,978 --> 01:55:53,241
- Why should I get in?
- Get in

2205
01:55:53,380 --> 01:55:54,973
Take her in

2206
01:55:55,348 --> 01:55:57,180
Why don't you release them?
There's no case now

2207
01:55:57,284 --> 01:55:58,718
We'll release them after
the proceedings

2208
01:55:58,985 --> 01:56:01,079
They're our people
Don't mess with them

2209
01:56:01,254 --> 01:56:02,449
Sir?

2210
01:56:02,589 --> 01:56:04,387
Aren't human rights
for humans?

2211
01:56:05,225 --> 01:56:06,590
Vijay, let's go

2212
01:56:07,260 --> 01:56:08,557
(crowd hoots)

2213
01:56:09,963 --> 01:56:10,725
Stop it

2214
01:56:10,997 --> 01:56:12,294
I said stop it

2215
01:57:10,690 --> 01:57:12,158
Go stand over there

2216
01:57:17,430 --> 01:57:19,091
Brother, you didn't kill her?

2217
01:57:19,499 --> 01:57:21,593
[Sulfi] Are the bottles safe?
[Suni] Shut up

2218
01:57:25,639 --> 01:57:27,698
Where were you
the last few days?

2219
01:57:28,642 --> 01:57:30,633
Sir, not few days

2220
01:57:31,745 --> 01:57:32,769
I left day before yesterday

2221
01:57:33,046 --> 01:57:34,445
Hardly two days

2222
01:57:35,448 --> 01:57:36,540
I'd an interview, sir

2223
01:57:36,683 --> 01:57:37,616
Interview?

2224
01:57:37,717 --> 01:57:39,185
Yes sir

2225
01:57:39,753 --> 01:57:40,743
Remya

2226
01:57:40,854 --> 01:57:42,015
Sir?

2227
01:57:42,122 --> 01:57:43,556
Note down the details
of her interview

2228
01:57:43,657 --> 01:57:45,125
In detail

2229
01:57:46,493 --> 01:57:48,587
No sir, I'll tell you

2230
01:57:50,463 --> 01:57:52,727
Sir, you know what I do

2231
01:57:53,433 --> 01:57:55,424
Usually, I don't go to
far-off places

2232
01:57:55,535 --> 01:57:57,333
But that night I slept off

2233
01:57:58,071 --> 01:58:00,096
When I woke up I was
in a remote village

2234
01:58:00,240 --> 01:58:01,503
in Karnataka

2235
01:58:02,676 --> 01:58:05,202
1 didn't know where I was
felt completely lost

2236
01:58:07,147 --> 01:58:09,514
At last, yesterday I found a truck
to get back home

2237
01:58:11,217 --> 01:58:12,616
That's what happened

2238
01:58:13,587 --> 01:58:15,316
Don't give us trouble

2239
01:58:15,455 --> 01:58:17,446
with your odd job

2240
01:58:17,591 --> 01:58:19,059
No sir

2241
01:58:19,693 --> 01:58:21,320
I've received a job offer

2242
01:58:21,728 --> 01:58:23,560
I'm going to stop this

2243
01:58:23,797 --> 01:58:25,629
Okay
That's fine

2244
01:58:25,732 --> 01:58:27,666
Anybody giving you trouble?

2245
01:58:37,410 --> 01:58:38,809
Sir, this one is a nuisance

2246
01:58:39,279 --> 01:58:40,405
He's always after me

2247
01:58:40,513 --> 01:58:41,810
Him?

2248
01:58:42,749 --> 01:58:44,217
Is that true?

2249
01:58:44,317 --> 01:58:46,308
Sir, I was just trying
to help her

2250
01:58:46,453 --> 01:58:47,887
like a good neighbor does

2251
01:58:48,154 --> 01:58:50,179
Do you go around helping
all your neighbours?

2252
01:58:50,323 --> 01:58:51,256
Sir, I

2253
01:58:51,391 --> 01:58:53,689
Sir, I'll take care of this

2254
01:58:54,127 --> 01:58:56,255
I've been planning to see his wife
about it

2255
01:58:56,896 --> 01:58:57,886
That'd be better

2256
01:58:58,164 --> 01:58:59,495
Are we set for
court proceedings?

2257
01:58:59,633 --> 01:59:00,600
- Yes, sir
- Then you go on

2258
01:59:00,700 --> 01:59:02,225
You can also go

2259
01:59:05,238 --> 01:59:06,535
Go

2260
01:59:07,574 --> 01:59:09,702
- [Kurian whispers] Jessy?
- Sir, I

2261
01:59:12,479 --> 01:59:14,106
Sir, may I go now?

2262
01:59:15,148 --> 01:59:16,673
You move to this side

2263
01:59:20,787 --> 01:59:22,551
You're behind this entire mess

2264
01:59:22,689 --> 01:59:23,713
No sir

2265
01:59:23,823 --> 01:59:25,848
What is your business
on the riverbank?

2266
01:59:25,959 --> 01:59:27,484
I'd no business there

2267
01:59:27,594 --> 01:59:29,528
Then what did you dump
in the river?

2268
01:59:29,763 --> 01:59:31,492
That sack was empty

2269
01:59:31,598 --> 01:59:33,566
You were seen carrying a sack
on your bike

2270
01:59:33,700 --> 01:59:35,725
No, sir, I didn't carry any
sack on my bike

2271
01:59:39,639 --> 01:59:41,903
Then what's this?

2272
01:59:49,249 --> 01:59:50,876
Sir, I'd waste from my hotel
and milk packets

2273
01:59:51,184 --> 01:59:53,209
for dumping
into the river

2274
01:59:55,989 --> 01:59:56,888
Good Lord

2275
01:59:56,990 --> 01:59:59,618
So you learned nothing
from the floods

2276
01:59:59,793 --> 02:00:01,693
River is not the place
to dump waste

2277
02:00:01,795 --> 02:00:03,285
We'll release the others
but not him

2278
02:00:03,396 --> 02:00:04,830
Slap Section 118 and file a case

2279
02:00:04,964 --> 02:00:07,456
Ask the panchayat to cancel
his license

2280
02:00:12,639 --> 02:00:13,936
Sir, one minute

2281
02:00:16,309 --> 02:00:17,708
Get their signatures
and release them

2282
02:00:17,844 --> 02:00:19,471
[police woman] Okay sir

2283
02:00:22,649 --> 02:00:23,946
Come

2284
02:00:30,390 --> 02:00:32,586
- What's your name?
- Abhilash Kumar

2285
02:00:35,395 --> 02:00:37,261
That's my real name

2286
02:00:37,697 --> 02:00:39,222
Sign here

2287
02:00:44,804 --> 02:00:46,272
Tell me

2288
02:00:46,706 --> 02:00:49,004
How did you get bloodstains
on your shirt?

2289
02:00:49,275 --> 02:00:50,299
I don't know, sir

2290
02:00:50,443 --> 02:00:51,672
- Tell the truth
-1 don't know, sir

2291
02:00:51,811 --> 02:00:53,404
No sir, please sir
don't hit Suni brother

2292
02:00:53,546 --> 02:00:55,537
-1 will tell you everything
- Shanavas

2293
02:01:03,590 --> 02:01:05,388
So you know everything?

2294
02:01:05,692 --> 02:01:06,625
Then you tell me

2295
02:01:06,726 --> 02:01:08,387
-1 don't know, sir
- Tell me

2296
02:01:11,765 --> 02:01:13,358
Sir, please don't hit him

2297
02:01:13,500 --> 02:01:16,401
- [Sulfi] Sir, please leave me
- No, sir, please leave him alone

2298
02:01:16,536 --> 02:01:18,527
1 will tell you everything, sir

2299
02:01:22,942 --> 02:01:24,706
So how many in total?

2300
02:01:25,678 --> 02:01:26,975
18 sacks

2301
02:01:27,580 --> 02:01:28,877
18?

2302
02:01:28,982 --> 02:01:30,916
You should be applauded

2303
02:01:31,017 --> 02:01:33,611
You guys managed to hide it
all this time

2304
02:01:36,356 --> 02:01:38,825
I understand it if you'd taken
a few bottles to drink

2305
02:01:39,759 --> 02:01:41,488
You did this to make money?

2306
02:01:41,628 --> 02:01:43,460
Are you fools?

2307
02:01:48,635 --> 02:01:49,932
Sir

2308
02:01:50,470 --> 02:01:51,960
Poverty forced us to do it

2309
02:01:52,071 --> 02:01:54,369
We thought of it as an easy way
to make money

2310
02:01:55,308 --> 02:01:57,436
Sir, please help us to
get out of this mess

2311
02:01:58,611 --> 02:02:00,909
Do you know the consequence
of what you've done?

2312
02:02:01,748 --> 02:02:02,943
Three years in jail

2313
02:02:03,049 --> 02:02:04,517
and a fine of Rupeel lakh

2314
02:02:04,651 --> 02:02:06,449
Even bail will be denied

2315
02:02:07,620 --> 02:02:09,452
Do you know where you'll be taken to?

2316
02:02:09,589 --> 02:02:10,886
To the jail

2317
02:02:11,591 --> 02:02:13,320

What?

2330
02:02:43,122 --> 02:02:45,022
Buy a 100-page notebook

Okay then

2335
02:02:54,434 --> 02:02:56,562
Come to the station
with a notebook

2336

Give me that

02:02:58,905 --> 02:03:00,373

02:03:32,872 --> 02:03:34,897
- Take it at your convenience
- What?

2344
02:03:35,642 --> 02:03:37,110
Take it at your convenience

2345
02:03:40,713 --> 02:03:42,010
Move aside

2346
02:03:43,549 --> 02:03:44,675
Okay then

2347
02:03:44,784 --> 02:03:46,047
Prakasha

2348
02:03:46,152 --> 02:03:47,881
Pack the properties

2349
02:03:50,890 --> 02:03:52,790
Sir, it's all done

2350
02:03:56,229 --> 02:03:57,697
Pack them up

2351
02:04:27,026 --> 02:04:28,994
Thaamara, don't break it

2352
02:04:40,473 --> 02:04:42,498
Suni brother, yesterday I...

2353
02:04:42,909 --> 02:04:44,206
It's okay

2354
02:04:45,244 --> 02:04:46,712
Forget it

2355
02:04:48,247 --> 02:04:49,715
Openiit

2356
02:04:58,091 --> 02:04:59,559
I'm leaving

2357
02:05:02,095 --> 02:05:03,563
Suni brother?

2358
02:05:08,668 --> 02:05:09,726
Suni brother?

2359
02:05:09,836 --> 02:05:11,133
Let him go

2360
02:05:50,143 --> 02:05:51,611
Geetha

2361
02:05:53,579 --> 02:05:54,876
Geetha

2362
02:06:59,846 --> 02:07:01,245
Say something to me

2363
02:07:09,789 --> 02:07:11,883
1 didn't know our life
would come to this

2364
02:07:13,192 --> 02:07:15,217
1 didn't know our life
would come to this

2365
02:07:18,030 --> 02:07:19,828
1 will stop drinking

2366
02:07:22,869 --> 02:07:24,598
I promise you'll never

2367
02:07:24,737 --> 02:07:26,068
Don't say anything now

2368
02:07:26,172 --> 02:07:27,867
I won't drink again

2369
02:07:32,178 --> 02:07:33,646
I won't

2370
02:07:39,185 --> 02:07:40,653
Don't cry

2371
02:07:48,327 --> 02:07:49,886
Did she have dinner?

2372
02:08:01,174 --> 02:08:02,642
Don't cry

2373
02:08:08,214 --> 02:08:09,841
What did you learn at school today?

2374
02:08:09,982 --> 02:08:11,006
I learned a song

2375
02:08:11,117 --> 02:08:12,050
Shall I sing?

2376
02:08:12,151 --> 02:08:13,084
Sure

2377
02:08:13,186 --> 02:08:14,711

2378
02:08:14,854 --> 02:08:15,787
This is her tea

2379
02:08:15,922 --> 02:08:17,321
Be careful
