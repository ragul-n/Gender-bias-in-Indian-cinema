Hi Hello Namasthe,
this is your RJ Silly Sunny!

2
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:20,886
Today I'm ready to share a lot of
love along with my mark enjoyment.

3
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:25,366
Yes! Hey, wish you lovely
lovely Valentine's day to all...

4
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,319
Love inside your heart is jumping
just like the waves on Vizag beach.

5
00:01:31,643 --> 00:01:33,010
I know that!

6
00:01:33,035 --> 00:01:37,266
I don't know if married
couples go on foreign trips...

7
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:42,236
But a love pair will visit our Vizag
beach, at least once in a life time.

8
00:01:42,572 --> 00:01:44,713
And they definitely won't miss Araku.

9
00:01:44,738 --> 00:01:47,581
That's who special our climate is!

10
00:01:47,889 --> 00:01:52,100
When did you write
your first love letter?

11
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:55,083
When did you taste your first kiss?

12
00:01:55,108 --> 00:01:57,694
And when did you feel your first hug?

13
00:01:57,974 --> 00:02:02,661
And... after all that...
Hey! First first first...

14
00:02:02,686 --> 00:02:05,213
When did you have your first experience!

15
00:02:05,238 --> 00:02:07,588
Let's move forward with
hot topics like these.

16
00:02:07,762 --> 00:02:12,887
Before the song, I have a honorable
request to both old and new lovers.

17
00:02:13,194 --> 00:02:17,358
Please don't walk into lodges and
guest houses in the name of love, bro!

18
00:02:17,423 --> 00:02:23,408
The police already warned that they will
thrash and turn you into a red rose!

19
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:27,840
Take care. Enjoy the first
melody with Silly Sunny!

Good!

27
00:02:50,516 --> 00:02:54,192
Finally this year's Valentine's
day happened in peace.

28
00:02:54,392 --> 00:02:55,454
Yes, sir!

29
00:02:56,608 --> 00:02:58,756
Good, let's meet up tomorrow.

-DOLPHIN GUEST HOUSE. VISAKHAPATNAM.
-Sir, the information is right.

31
00:03:02,572 --> 00:03:04,057
You can come now.

32
00:03:06,297 --> 00:03:07,883

33
00:03:10,699 --> 00:03:12,441
Come on... fast!

37
00:03:31,393 --> 00:03:33,158
Do you even know how
young you are for this?

38
00:03:33,649 --> 00:03:35,415
You are all teenagers, you...

43
00:03:50,808 --> 00:03:53,238
-Whom do you catch, sir?
-Why the sudden raid, sir?

44
00:03:53,263 --> 00:03:54,938
Are there any celebrities
among them, sir?

45
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:58,384
-Tell us, sir.
-Is this a general raid or not?

46
00:03:58,476 --> 00:03:59,921
-Amith...
-Sir?

47
00:03:59,946 --> 00:04:03,220
-Click their pictures.
-Why are you clicking our pictures, sir?

48
00:04:04,414 --> 00:04:06,969
There are teenagers in the group. So...

49
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,241
Nothing regarding this
raid should get out.

50
00:04:10,983 --> 00:04:12,827
If you don't follow this...

51
00:04:13,432 --> 00:04:17,158
The one who does so will
be far away from media...

52
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:19,996
And he'll be very close to the mortuary.

53
00:04:20,021 --> 00:04:23,248
So there are your or your relatives' kids
for you to scary the media away, right?

54
00:04:23,273 --> 00:04:25,695
What will you do if
your kids are in there?

55
00:04:26,372 --> 00:04:28,973
-Our kids?
-This same tension...

56
00:04:29,192 --> 00:04:31,200
Even their parents feel it!

57
00:04:31,758 --> 00:04:34,234
That's why I'm telling you.
Please try to understand.

58
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:35,991
And please forget about
this, right now.

59
00:04:36,638 --> 00:04:40,661
I'll summon their parents
for a strong counseling.

60
00:04:40,686 --> 00:04:44,340
So please try to understand.
Please, leave. It's my request.

65

Sorry to say.
Please switch on the TV once, sir.

We are looking at the visuals of
Geetha jumping off the Dolphin hotel.

67

Geetha had bullet wounds on her body.

68

In the process of getting to the
killer, SP Rajiv got shot.

69
00:06:02,385 --> 00:06:05,315

department responds to this incident.

00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:19,050
-Hey, Rajiv. Are you ok?
-Sir, I'm fine.

72
00:06:19,381 --> 00:06:20,772
Come on, sit sit.

73
00:06:25,537 --> 00:06:26,779
What happened?

74
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:29,924
According to the information
we have got until now...

75
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,872
She worked as a model
in VM modeling agency, sir.

76
00:06:35,288 --> 00:06:40,170
If she's there to meet someone?
Or did someone get her there by force?

77
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:44,264
We are investigating on these leads, sir.

78
00:06:44,962 --> 00:06:48,227
-Tell me.
-How wants to attack her?

79
00:06:48,781 --> 00:06:51,266
-We'll know that soon, sir.
-Good!

80
00:06:51,366 --> 00:06:54,319
Then I'll forward this
case to one town SI Kumar.

81
00:06:54,467 --> 00:06:57,029
I'll call you back for
your help on this case.

82
00:06:57,054 --> 00:07:00,164
So, you can take rest.
And you may leave.

83
00:07:00,495 --> 00:07:01,776
Yes, sir.

-Industry can't survive without me.
-Here's your tea.

86
00:07:34,645 --> 00:07:37,973
The glass size is reducing
and tea cost is increasing!

87
00:07:38,754 --> 00:07:40,043
Maintain some quality.

88
00:07:41,101 --> 00:07:42,492
God, it tastes really bad.

89
00:07:43,745 --> 00:07:45,059
And Raghu...

90
00:07:45,084 --> 00:07:48,497
You have been this strong, drinking
this bad-tasting tea from 10 years.

91
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:50,865
Reduce both sugar and sarcasm.

Everything will be right.

94
00:07:56,222 --> 00:07:59,089
You developed after getting internet.
Seem like a great package!

95
00:07:59,114 --> 00:08:02,320
Ok, hand me a cigarette.
I'll pay all at once.

96
00:08:04,826 --> 00:08:08,717
Are you trying to get me thrashed
by goons to make me pay? Not right!

97
00:08:09,663 --> 00:08:12,429
I won't give you that much of a
scene, just for 300 rupees.

like ambassadors for filthy people!

the position of the producer, isn't it?

103
00:08:26,453 --> 00:08:29,546

We are senior fighters.

Leave my shirt!

105
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:34,285
30 members came to the location and
you have selected only one, right?

106
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:37,394
-Are you the director or the producer?
-I'm everything! I decide everything!

107
00:08:37,586 --> 00:08:40,477
-Shut up!
-Why do you even care, huh?

108
00:08:40,965 --> 00:08:43,544
-Because I'm the production manager.
-So what?

109
00:08:43,697 --> 00:08:46,978
-I have to have my commission, right?
-Your commission?

110
00:08:48,122 --> 00:08:49,122
What?

111
00:09:03,048 --> 00:09:06,079
Krishna brother,
someone is hitting your friend.

112
00:09:46,087 --> 00:09:47,860
-Speak out!
-What?

113
00:09:49,678 --> 00:09:53,006
That's Krishna. We missed him last time.
This time, we have to get him.

114
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:07,376
Hey, stop!

115
00:10:09,354 --> 00:10:10,526
Get him!

116
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,981
Hey... It's me!

117
00:11:32,395 --> 00:11:35,168
Did you thrash all of them, just for me?

118
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,746
-Are you ok?
-Ok.

119
00:11:37,771 --> 00:11:40,044
-He's Kalyan, the director.
-Will he give us a chance?

120
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:42,768
-No, he'll give us leads.
-Drop me on the way.

121
00:11:52,952 --> 00:11:54,202
What's the issue?

122
00:11:54,227 --> 00:11:56,468
Nothing! I complained about
them acting smart on set.

123
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:58,520
-And the producer fired them.
-Stop here.

124
00:12:02,548 --> 00:12:03,649
Do you need all this?

125
00:12:03,674 --> 00:12:06,018
How can I foresee what's coming?

126
00:12:06,043 --> 00:12:07,327
Two coconuts.

127
00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:10,383
I would have thrashed you
if I would have known this.

128
00:12:10,408 --> 00:12:12,509
Whatever the case...
You fought to save me.

129
00:12:12,829 --> 00:12:15,727
I'm so proud to have a roommate like you.
I have to do something for you.

130
00:12:19,412 --> 00:12:23,638
Introduce me to your producer, Ratnam,
and make me the lead in some money.

131
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,948
Don't worry. I'll launch you as a hero.

132
00:12:28,252 --> 00:12:29,479
Pay for the coconuts.

133
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,194
Tasted nice.

134
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:37,361
-So let's eat tiffin on our way?
-You...

135
00:12:39,289 --> 00:12:42,656
This is the location.
Director Kalyan stays here. Go meet him.

136
00:12:43,121 --> 00:12:45,809
-Ok, bye. Call me when you are done.
-Bye, dude. I'll call you.

137
00:12:50,798 --> 00:12:54,102
-Will the heroine come? I have to see her.
-Yeah, me too.

138
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:55,746
-How she might look!
-Yeah.

139
00:12:57,017 --> 00:12:58,361
Let's go.

140
00:12:59,603 --> 00:13:00,713
She's here.

141
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:16,594
-Madam, where are you all these days?
-Such a beauty!

142
00:13:16,743 --> 00:13:20,110
She's all over Google. Full happening!

143
00:13:20,135 --> 00:13:21,690
That's how their lives are.

144
00:13:21,811 --> 00:13:25,382
Madam, what's the reason for leaving your
career in between, and making a comeback?

145
00:13:25,407 --> 00:13:29,554
Past is past! I'm here now. I'll tell
you everything when the time is right.

146

Ok? Thank you. And, love you all!

-Yeah!

-Yeah, he told me.

All of them are writers?

00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:10,735
-Who's that celebrity?
-Parijatham.

172
00:15:11,067 --> 00:15:12,536
She a girl next door.

173
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:17,311
Our street at 16 years...
Our colony at 20 years...

174
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:21,697
And our entire city at 25...
She shook them off, sir!

175
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:24,049
Madam sounds like a freedom fighter.

176
00:15:24,074 --> 00:15:26,733
No. She's a social worker, sir.

177
00:15:28,282 --> 00:15:31,977
I wrote a story with all
her sweet memories, sir.

178
00:15:32,244 --> 00:15:36,166
-Are you her customer too?
-Since last 10 years.

179
00:15:36,377 --> 00:15:40,862
Of course, looking at his
shyness, not just a story...

180
00:15:41,102 --> 00:15:43,837
He would have written
his bed stories too!

181
00:15:43,862 --> 00:15:46,865
Do this... You go romance her.

182
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:50,765
Let's make a movie when she
becomes a national figure.

183
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:53,735
Just come see her once...
and you want to do it right away.

184
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,117
-Do what?
-Bio-pic, sir.

185
00:15:55,309 --> 00:15:58,465
-Oh my holy angels!
-Hey, you get lost.

186
00:16:01,235 --> 00:16:04,211
Where's the bouquet?
He might have got it on rent.

187
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:06,840
Next! Come sit.

188
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:09,441
-New writer, sir. Deal softly.
-It's ok.

189
00:16:10,097 --> 00:16:11,761
-Start.
-[inaudible]

190
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:15,471
-Don't scare me. Just narrate.
-[inaudible]

191
00:16:16,495 --> 00:16:18,159
-Ok, leave.
-Get lost!

192
00:16:22,547 --> 00:16:24,348
Leave! Come sit.

193
00:16:30,619 --> 00:16:32,025
Slicing up people...

194
00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:34,454
Get lost! Send another.

195
00:16:35,597 --> 00:16:37,206
Literal hell!

196
00:16:43,508 --> 00:16:46,383
Sir... Mr. Shastri.

197
00:16:46,648 --> 00:16:48,945
-Namasthe.
-Namasthe!

198
00:16:49,497 --> 00:16:52,458
Sir, stop acting smart and start.

199
00:16:52,632 --> 00:16:53,992
Silly fellow!

200
00:16:54,696 --> 00:16:55,845
Bless the story!

201
00:16:56,088 --> 00:16:59,158
Do you want the base
story or the whole story?

202
00:17:00,349 --> 00:17:02,662
Whole story,
but keep it as short as a base story.

203
00:17:02,687 --> 00:17:04,856
-Ok, sir.
-[counting]

204
00:17:04,881 --> 00:17:10,483
-We know Rama searching for Sita.
-Yeah, we do.

205
00:17:10,787 --> 00:17:12,053
Just for a change...

206
00:17:12,381 --> 00:17:16,088
Rama went to Sri Lanka on a secret
mission, without a passport.

207
00:17:16,113 --> 00:17:18,747
Let's say the jobless
Surpanaka loved him.

208
00:17:19,826 --> 00:17:20,958
Let's say...

209
00:17:21,116 --> 00:17:23,898
Ok, let's say so. Continue.

210
00:17:24,283 --> 00:17:26,104
Ravanasura comes to know about this.

211
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:29,061
He captured Rama,
who came in illegally.

212
00:17:29,086 --> 00:17:33,886
He says he will let him go if he married
his sister, or else he'll kill him.

213
00:17:34,168 --> 00:17:36,137
Let's say he sent this
to Sita on WhatsApp.

214
00:17:36,162 --> 00:17:38,332
-Let's say...
-Let's just say so, sir.

215
00:17:38,703 --> 00:17:41,266
-Ok, let's say so.
-We did.

216
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:44,217
So Sita, to save her husband...

217
00:17:44,242 --> 00:17:47,270
Let's say she asked for Rajini
Robo's help from India.

218
00:17:47,569 --> 00:17:50,428
[all]: Just to say so, right?
Let's say so.

219
00:17:50,993 --> 00:17:52,220
-Super.
-Continue.

220
00:17:52,245 --> 00:17:54,865
What happened next is the story.

221
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:56,649
-Who is it?
-Mr. Sasthri...

222
00:17:56,945 --> 00:17:59,710
Why didn't Rama take his passport?
He should have, right?

223
00:17:59,735 --> 00:18:01,397
Because it's a secret mission.

224
00:18:01,422 --> 00:18:03,319
-Point!
-He's not involved in the story, sir.

225
00:18:03,344 --> 00:18:05,355
Did you come up with this
doubt all by yourself?

226
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,884
-Yes.
-Did you like the story?

227
00:18:07,016 --> 00:18:09,977
-Superb!
-Cool. Give him the story then.

228
00:18:10,002 --> 00:18:12,525
He'll make the movie and I'll
be the production manager.

229
00:18:12,595 --> 00:18:14,704
-Let's say so.
-What the hell!

230
00:18:14,974 --> 00:18:17,670
-Shut up!
-Maybe he didn't like the story.

231
00:18:17,695 --> 00:18:21,221
-Bheema in Ramayana...
-Where did Bheema come from in Ramayana?

232
00:18:21,626 --> 00:18:24,470
Damn you! Oh my holy angels!

233
00:18:25,643 --> 00:18:28,291
-Today is a really bad day...
-Producer sir...

234
00:18:28,534 --> 00:18:31,081
-Want to hear a fresh love story?
-One more?

235
00:18:31,106 --> 00:18:32,949
One more after all this?

236
00:18:32,974 --> 00:18:35,695
I don't have that mood. Let's move!

237
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:38,016
Move... Start walking.

238
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:42,334
-Move!
-Sir, I want to tell you something, sir.

239
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:45,794
What do you want to say?
Did you write a story too?

240
00:18:45,819 --> 00:18:46,864
No no no!

241
00:18:46,889 --> 00:18:49,518
This is Real Ratnam. Keep it real!

242
00:18:49,543 --> 00:18:52,727
Sir... One of my friends
is trying to become a hero.

243
00:18:52,752 --> 00:18:55,111
I want you to meet him,
if you permit me to...

244
00:18:56,111 --> 00:18:59,400
The younger son cried for a wedding,
right when the older son lost his wife!

245
00:18:59,425 --> 00:19:02,902
We have to have a story first, for your
friend to be a hero or a villain, right?

246
00:19:02,927 --> 00:19:04,709
-We can think of him then.
-Sir sir sir...

247
00:19:04,856 --> 00:19:06,981
-Stop!
-Hey, you go.

248
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,188
-Who are you?
-Namasthe, sir.

249
00:19:09,213 --> 00:19:11,297
-Namasthe! Who are you?
-My name is Surya, sir.

250
00:19:11,852 --> 00:19:14,328
I have a great story, sir.
You'll like it for sure.

251
00:19:14,538 --> 00:19:17,405
I am looking for a direction chance
in your production house, sir.

252
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:20,076
He's not in the mood. You can
narrate it to me. Sir, please...

253
00:19:20,115 --> 00:19:23,490
Hello! I'm not here to narrate
to assistants and watchmen.

254
00:19:23,515 --> 00:19:26,473
-I'm here to narrate to the boss.
-Wow! That's a good one.

255
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,972
-Thank you, sir.
-As he said, I'm not in the mood.

256
00:19:28,997 --> 00:19:30,962
-Come after four days. Ok?
-Ok, sir.

257
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,966
Sir, let me get the door!

258
00:19:36,762 --> 00:19:38,770
-Take care, sir.
-Enough of overacting.

259
00:19:41,757 --> 00:19:43,218
[phone rings]

260
00:19:44,821 --> 00:19:46,438
Krishna, I'm coming.

261
00:19:47,295 --> 00:19:49,248
Bro... Bro...

262
00:19:49,636 --> 00:19:51,964
Can you give me his home address?
I'll try there.

263
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,678
Office boys and assistants won't do
that, bro. Try it on your own.

264
00:20:01,482 --> 00:20:05,153
Looks like a haunted house.
Do you think there are humans inside?

265
00:20:05,806 --> 00:20:07,439
I feel the same!

266
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:10,738
Let's go.

267
00:20:19,687 --> 00:20:22,210
Man, there's no one here!

268
00:20:38,006 --> 00:20:39,264
Hey...

269
00:20:56,101 --> 00:20:57,851
-They are shooting.
-Is it?

270
00:20:59,015 --> 00:21:01,796
-Shooting!
-God!

271
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:05,251
Madam, is this Karteeka Deepam serial?
Is Doctor sir here?

272
00:21:05,298 --> 00:21:07,548
Doctor sir...

273
00:21:07,949 --> 00:21:09,785
-Cooking sister!
-Hello!

274
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:13,166
-Yeah, Doctor sir?
-No. I'm the manager.

275
00:21:13,326 --> 00:21:15,451
-Are you Krishna?
-No, sir. It's him.

276
00:21:15,844 --> 00:21:18,813
Are you Krishna? Come on.
Are you his son Mahesh babu? Come on.

277
00:21:27,459 --> 00:21:29,826
Hey, ask the co-director
to bring the camera.

278
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,389
-Fold your hands.
-Sir, I'm an artist.

279
00:21:43,797 --> 00:21:45,164
[indistinct chatter]

280
00:21:47,486 --> 00:21:50,744
-Where's the sugar in it?
-As if you paid that well!

281
00:21:51,961 --> 00:21:53,437
Idiot!

282
00:21:53,844 --> 00:21:55,976
-What did he do earlier?
-Breakfast, sir.

283
00:21:56,286 --> 00:21:59,403
-I'm asking about experience.
-No experience, sir.

284
00:21:59,428 --> 00:22:01,467
He just wants to be a hero,
and nothing else, sir.

285
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:08,521
-Hero?
-Yes, sir.

286
00:22:08,546 --> 00:22:09,778
-Only hero?
-Yes.

287
00:22:09,803 --> 00:22:11,487
-What about remuneration?
-200 per day...

288
00:22:11,512 --> 00:22:15,361
Stop! That's not important, sir.
The character needs to be good.

289
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:18,634
Wow, super! You have a great future.

290
00:22:19,735 --> 00:22:21,298
-Fill this form.
-Yes, sir.

291
00:22:21,323 --> 00:22:23,310
-There is a girl at the counter.
-A girl?

292
00:22:23,435 --> 00:22:25,037
Hey, step back!

293
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,822
Fill the form, tell them that I
have sent you, hand her the form...

294
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,938
-And she will take care of the rest.
-Ok, sir.

295
00:22:30,963 --> 00:22:32,714
-Are you free this evening, sir.
-Yeah.

296
00:22:32,739 --> 00:22:36,542
-Get a sugar test done.
-God! He looks like a bigger jerk than me.

297
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,402
EPAP production house.

298
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:40,383

00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:43,270
Background artist, 500 per day.

300
00:22:44,015 --> 00:22:46,242

I'll do this role. Please!

304
00:22:53,528 --> 00:22:55,727
Do it. You are also an artist, right?
Round it off.

305
00:22:56,434 --> 00:22:58,676
Thank you! Villian role, 25k per day.

306
00:22:58,701 --> 00:23:00,799

00:23:06,887 --> 00:23:10,270
This is what I want. Round it off!
Let's go give the girl our dates.

309
00:23:11,042 --> 00:23:13,526
The fat manager over there sent us.

310
00:23:13,582 --> 00:23:16,355
-Please!
-Hey... Hi!

311
00:23:17,302 --> 00:23:19,856
-Hi!
-You did a great performance back there.

312
00:23:19,992 --> 00:23:21,874
I thought it's real and got scared.

313
00:23:21,899 --> 00:23:24,628
-Thank you.
-You did well. Even I got scared.

314
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:28,347
Oh, I forgot to tell...
He's the hero in this film.

315
00:23:29,186 --> 00:23:30,827
I'm also a doing a main role.

316
00:23:31,169 --> 00:23:32,997
-10k per day.
-Is it?

317
00:23:33,022 --> 00:23:35,530
-Congrats to you both.
-We are here to collect the advance.

318
00:23:35,855 --> 00:23:38,035
Sir, are you paying online or in cash?

319
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,741
Google Pay.
Tell me your number, I'll ping.

320
00:23:39,766 --> 00:23:42,710
-Sir?
-First time payment, right?

321
00:23:43,969 --> 00:23:45,539
-Let's go for cash.
-Cash.

322
00:23:45,564 --> 00:23:47,382
-The total will be 60k, sir.
-Ok.

323
00:23:47,407 --> 00:23:49,800
You have to pay total 12
lakhs for 20-day schedule.

324
00:23:49,933 --> 00:23:52,457
I'll register your names if you pay now.

325
00:23:52,482 --> 00:23:54,957
-What? We have to pay?
-What?

326
00:23:54,982 --> 00:23:57,534
We have to act, and pay?
You have to pay us, right?

327
00:23:57,559 --> 00:23:59,045
-You got confused.
-Sir!

328
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:01,344

00:24:01,369 --> 00:24:02,469

That's our EPAP rule, sir.
You can read it here.

331
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:09,923
What? It's very clear here...
We didn't see this!

332
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,206
Hello, look at this.

333
00:24:11,231 --> 00:24:13,358

00:24:18,289 --> 00:24:21,453
According to the roles
they are interested in...

337
00:24:21,478 --> 00:24:22,852
They have to pay us...

338
00:24:22,978 --> 00:24:25,783
To register their roles, please!

339
00:24:27,586 --> 00:24:30,648
Due to strong competition,
this is a limited period offer...

340
00:24:30,812 --> 00:24:33,984
So get your role fast.
Yedureetha (Swin across) film management.

341
00:24:34,009 --> 00:24:37,567
All the best too in the end! If we are
rich, we will go to a better place, right?

342
00:24:37,731 --> 00:24:41,020
And the title is 'Swim across'.
Call the manager. Manager!

343
00:24:41,504 --> 00:24:43,372
[singing a song on bad fate]

344
00:24:44,221 --> 00:24:46,768
You want juice? Bro, three juice.

345
00:24:46,888 --> 00:24:49,302
-And you are...
-Trying as an actress there.

346
00:24:49,456 --> 00:24:51,315
Let's see. Hey, it's them calling.

347
00:24:51,941 --> 00:24:53,097
Hello!

348
00:24:53,948 --> 00:24:55,480
-Hey, thank you.
-Here.

349
00:24:55,505 --> 00:24:59,085
Hey! Lucky that they have selected
me without paying them anything.

350
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:01,466
-Song shoot in RK studios tomorrow.
-Super!

351
00:25:01,494 --> 00:25:04,041
-Girls have all these offers! But boys...
-God!

352
00:25:04,066 --> 00:25:05,486
[phone rings]

353
00:25:06,953 --> 00:25:08,390
Sudha, tell me!

354
00:25:09,089 --> 00:25:11,464
What's there to tell? Did you meet him?

355
00:25:11,654 --> 00:25:14,521
-I'm meeting him everyday.
-Are you fighting as usual?

356
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:16,678
Nothing like that. I'm here on some work.

357
00:25:16,776 --> 00:25:19,377
Ok ok, come home soon.

358
00:25:19,402 --> 00:25:20,604
-Bye!
-Ok.

359
00:25:51,923 --> 00:25:53,455
Hey, where's the manager?

360
00:25:55,188 --> 00:25:58,633
Sir, director wants all the
artists on sets in 5 minutes, sir.

361
00:25:58,658 --> 00:26:01,183
I beg you... Manage for 15 minutes.

362
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:03,288
-He's not picking the call.
-He's calling them, sir.

363
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:04,645
Get lost!

364
00:26:04,722 --> 00:26:06,652
Everyone keeps poking us!

365
00:26:25,051 --> 00:26:26,871
Sir, please give me that chance, sir.

366
00:26:26,896 --> 00:26:28,526
Please stop!

367
00:26:28,551 --> 00:26:32,947
He paid us money.
He will make a mess, right? Keep quiet!

368
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:38,084
Sir, keep this money for your
personal expenses, sir. Please!

369
00:26:38,516 --> 00:26:40,446
-Are you bribing me?
-Manager!

370
00:26:41,113 --> 00:26:45,801
With that mike in his hand,
he keeps shouting 'Manager' all day.

371
00:26:46,373 --> 00:26:48,967
God! Go put some makeup
on and get into the sets.

372
00:26:48,992 --> 00:26:50,994
-Thank you, sir.
-Production...

373
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:13,115
â™ªWhat's happening...â™ª

374
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:16,163
â™ªWhy does my heart keep racing?â™ª

375
00:27:17,573 --> 00:27:21,791
â™ªIt's hopping, running, and smiling...â™ª

376
00:27:22,615 --> 00:27:24,724
-Camera!
-Rolling, sir.

377
00:27:24,749 --> 00:27:25,989
Action!

378
00:27:26,014 --> 00:27:30,562
â™ªLike a little rain drop...
Like a sweet memory...â™ª

379
00:27:30,729 --> 00:27:33,784
â™ªMy hopes are taking new life...â™ª

380
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:39,258
â™ªLike a dream taking like and
like a want that's chasing me...â™ª

381
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:42,244
â™ªMy does I feel so brave?â™ª

382
00:27:43,834 --> 00:27:48,270
â™ªWhat's happening...â™ª

383
00:27:48,295 --> 00:27:51,318
â™ªWhy does my heart keep racing?â™ª

384
00:27:52,728 --> 00:27:56,946
â™ªIt's hopping, running, and smiling...â™ª

385
00:27:56,971 --> 00:28:00,123
â™ªAll these dreams are killing me.â™ª

386
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:23,016
â™ªAll your words are oozing like love...â™ª

387
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:27,406
â™ªAnd there are overflowing
out of my heart...â™ª

388
00:28:27,752 --> 00:28:31,892
â™ªAll the pace in my breathe...â™ª

389
00:28:32,202 --> 00:28:36,390
â™ªIt's begging me to meet you.â™ª

390
00:28:36,455 --> 00:28:40,807
â™ªI searched for the minutes
when we get to talk.â™ª

391
00:28:40,965 --> 00:28:45,153
â™ªMy heart got to know
the reason behind it.â™ª

392
00:28:45,178 --> 00:28:50,606
â™ªMy eyes have learnt the
meaning of all the silent signs...â™ª

393
00:28:56,282 --> 00:28:58,422
-Is this the correct address?
-Yeah.

394
00:29:00,401 --> 00:29:03,549
-Sure?
-This is where the ladies' hostels are.

395
00:29:03,574 --> 00:29:05,478
I know. Don't worry. Cool!

396
00:29:05,899 --> 00:29:09,883
Dude, why is she staying in a hostel?

397
00:29:10,556 --> 00:29:12,860
Rent a double bedroom house then...
Let's shift her there.

398
00:29:12,885 --> 00:29:14,102
Shut up!

399
00:29:15,058 --> 00:29:18,456
She's from Araku, near Vizag.
She's here to try and get into movies.

400
00:29:23,798 --> 00:29:25,493
Dude, why is she not here yet?

401
00:29:46,536 --> 00:29:48,013
-Hi!
-Hello!

402
00:29:48,195 --> 00:29:49,507
[both]: What are you doing here?

403
00:29:51,876 --> 00:29:54,376
Actually, I stay here. This is my hostel.

404
00:29:54,629 --> 00:29:57,441
-And you...
-That's nothing...

405
00:29:57,466 --> 00:30:00,214
-There is a shoot happening here.
-Oh, where?

406
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:01,960
-Left!
-Right!

407
00:30:03,002 --> 00:30:04,283
-Left...
-Left.

408
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:06,886
Fine! Please go.

409
00:30:07,253 --> 00:30:08,691
-Let's meet again.
-Ok.

410
00:30:08,716 --> 00:30:09,952
-Bye!
-Let's get out of here.

411
00:30:11,722 --> 00:30:13,339
-Excuse me.
-What now?

412
00:30:13,587 --> 00:30:14,868
Tell me.

413
00:30:15,077 --> 00:30:16,554
Can I have your number?

414
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,398
I mean,
my friend here is a manager.

415
00:30:19,637 --> 00:30:22,379
He works with producer Real Ratnam.
Just to refer you.

416
00:30:23,317 --> 00:30:24,474
Note it down.

417
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:29,656
8341153023.

418
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:32,097
-Ok.
-Thanks!

419
00:30:33,306 --> 00:30:35,251
-Did I tell you to ask her the number?
-Shut up!

420
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,658
-Excuse me.
-Yeah?

421
00:30:43,423 --> 00:30:47,673
Even my friends keep
shooting all the time.

422
00:30:47,698 --> 00:30:50,987
-Ok...
-Your number.

423
00:30:51,012 --> 00:30:52,042
You can have mine.

424
00:31:24,261 --> 00:31:26,370
-Uncle, Shruthi.
-Namasthe.

425
00:31:26,607 --> 00:31:27,724
Namasthe!

426
00:31:32,448 --> 00:31:36,752
â™ªWhatever I'm doing, I think about you.â™ª

427
00:31:36,845 --> 00:31:40,907
â™ªHow can your thoughts
get so frank with me?â™ª

428
00:31:41,248 --> 00:31:45,513
â™ªI end up asking for more...â™ª

429
00:31:45,538 --> 00:31:49,888
â™ªHow can I just keep asking
for your friendship!â™ª

430
00:31:49,914 --> 00:31:54,195
â™ªThe love inside our
hearts is making a move.â™ª

431
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:58,705
â™ªIt's making us go wild, inside.â™ª

432
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:04,019
â™ªAll these crazy dreams are
giving me sleepless nights!â™ª

433
00:32:13,816 --> 00:32:18,176
I just came to know that a person we like
by our side, will give a lot of strength.

434
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:26,253
The titles will be rolling
on half the screen, sir.

435
00:32:26,588 --> 00:32:31,268
Another half, both the zombies hold
hands, without having heads...

436
00:32:31,293 --> 00:32:34,121
-And they walk away, sir.
-Wow!

437
00:32:35,003 --> 00:32:36,565
-Such great writing!
-Thank you, sir.

438
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:37,909
-Super!
-Thank you, sir.

439
00:32:37,934 --> 00:32:40,595
My entire mood got changed
after listening to your story.

440
00:32:40,884 --> 00:32:44,313
-I suddenly got energetic!
-Thank you, sir.

441
00:32:44,466 --> 00:32:47,693
Sir, I too liked the story,
but it's not real, right?

442
00:32:47,893 --> 00:32:49,370
Is it ok for our banner?

443
00:32:49,927 --> 00:32:51,981
-This is not a real story?
-No, sir.

444
00:32:52,006 --> 00:32:53,794
-All this is imagination!
-Yes, sir.

445
00:32:53,819 --> 00:32:55,898
Oh my holy angels!

446
00:32:55,923 --> 00:33:00,043
Sir, how can a zombie story
happen in real life, sir? Impossible!

447
00:33:00,072 --> 00:33:04,689
-Making this movie is also impossible.
-You liked the story just now...

448
00:33:04,714 --> 00:33:07,965
No matter how much I like it,
it has to be real for me to make it.

449
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:09,719
That's both my strength and weakness.

450
00:33:09,744 --> 00:33:13,518
Many producers made movies
on Alluri Sitarama Raju...

451
00:33:13,698 --> 00:33:17,760
But I made the same story in
Rutherford's point of view...

452
00:33:17,785 --> 00:33:18,992
And made millions.

453
00:33:19,156 --> 00:33:23,367
When Vijay Mallya went out of
country, I made 'Beer & Visa'.

454
00:33:23,613 --> 00:33:24,910
I made millions again.

455
00:33:24,935 --> 00:33:29,640
In the eyes point of view of a brand
ambassador for shades, Karunanidhi...

456
00:33:29,918 --> 00:33:32,098
I'm planning 'Black Glasses'.

457
00:33:32,138 --> 00:33:35,535
I make reality the base for my movies.

458
00:33:35,663 --> 00:33:37,678
I made millions as 'Real Ratnam'.

459
00:33:37,703 --> 00:33:40,656
I fixed it that I should never live
in imagination, even for a day.

460
00:33:40,884 --> 00:33:44,259
Sir, then my story won't
make it to be a film, sir?

461
00:33:44,377 --> 00:33:47,752
-Any imaginative story won't.
-Shut up!

462
00:33:48,385 --> 00:33:50,674
Surya, I like your dedication.

463
00:33:50,699 --> 00:33:53,173
-So I give you my word.
-Ok, sir.

464
00:33:53,432 --> 00:33:57,018
Bring me a real story and I will make
a film, no matter what line it is.

465
00:33:57,043 --> 00:33:58,535
-Ok, thank you, sir.
-Bye!

466
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,565
Wow! Yes!

467
00:34:16,693 --> 00:34:18,459
Why don't you play with us?

468
00:34:18,484 --> 00:34:21,249
We are food-players.
Not football players.

469
00:34:21,862 --> 00:34:25,112
Forget about me... You play really well!

470
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:29,401
Shruthi... State level player.
I even have a cup at home.

471
00:34:30,525 --> 00:34:32,634
Then why did you come into acting?

472
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:36,656
Because I'm mad about acting...
Just like you.

473
00:34:36,881 --> 00:34:38,827
-I want to be an actress!
-Wow!

474
00:34:39,315 --> 00:34:42,955
What about family? Mom, dad, kids...

475
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,229
Are you joking?

476
00:34:45,024 --> 00:34:48,141
I don't have a dad... Just me and mom.

477
00:34:48,656 --> 00:34:51,617
I used to have a sister, but she died.

478
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:54,274
It's a long story!

479
00:34:56,872 --> 00:35:00,130
-Tell me.-Real Ratnam is in mood for an audition.

480
00:35:00,155 --> 00:35:01,297
Coming.

481
00:35:07,887 --> 00:35:11,410
Come fast. He's straightforward.
Talk carefully.

482
00:35:11,435 --> 00:35:12,983
-You have to manage. Ok?
-Ok.

483
00:35:13,008 --> 00:35:14,061
-Did you eat?
-No.

484
00:35:14,086 --> 00:35:15,178
We too have no food here.

485
00:35:18,807 --> 00:35:21,455
-Sir, my friend Krishna.
-Hi, sir.

486
00:35:21,783 --> 00:35:23,767
You look like vintage Chiranjeevi.

487
00:35:23,805 --> 00:35:25,821
Why is your name Krishna then?

488
00:35:28,223 --> 00:35:29,754
I was just joking. Come, sit.

489
00:35:30,937 --> 00:35:32,554
Come.

490
00:35:35,283 --> 00:35:39,220
You have to know about me to act
in my movies or under my banner.

491
00:35:39,245 --> 00:35:41,845
-I got this name because...
-I already told him about you, sir.

492
00:35:42,024 --> 00:35:45,266
-He keeps asking about you.
-Yes, sir.

493
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:49,915
My granny used to say that knowing about
great people give us great dreams.

494
00:35:50,182 --> 00:35:54,002
I like you. You seem to have great
ethics, just like me.

495
00:35:54,726 --> 00:35:57,797
-Sir, he being a hero...
-I'm coming to that.

496
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,633
-Krishna...
-Sir?

497
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:02,512
Your face might look good.
But you have to act well too, right?

498
00:36:02,537 --> 00:36:06,340
-Yes, sir.
-Perform a bit for me.

499
00:36:07,558 --> 00:36:09,190
-Hey...
-Sir, just a minute.

500
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:14,120
-What can I do suddenly?
-He's mad about reality.

501
00:36:14,145 --> 00:36:15,578
Manage something.

502
00:36:16,013 --> 00:36:17,895
-Krishna...
-Sir.

503
00:36:18,114 --> 00:36:21,271
Take his advice and
you'll stoop to hell.

504
00:36:21,296 --> 00:36:23,093
-And you keep me as your manager!
-Cool!

505
00:36:23,118 --> 00:36:24,491
Bloody!

506
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,943
-Are you done discussing?
-Yeah, sir.

507
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:30,024
Ready, sir. Will do a bit
from the Challenge movie, sir.

508
00:36:30,049 --> 00:36:32,789
-Oh!
-I'll use him with your permission, sir.

509
00:36:32,814 --> 00:36:34,855
Use me if you have to.

510
00:36:37,618 --> 00:36:39,625
-This is too much!
-Sorry, sir. I'm in character.

511
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:41,760
-Oh, go on.
-Ok, sir. Thank you!

512
00:36:46,528 --> 00:36:48,028
Good morning, sir.

513
00:36:49,324 --> 00:36:52,012
-Are you the father of the nation?
-No, sir.

514
00:36:52,254 --> 00:36:55,300
I'm not even a father.
I'm not married.

515
00:36:55,325 --> 00:36:59,329
Some call me 'Father of unemployment'.

516
00:36:59,645 --> 00:37:02,294
Not just practical jokes...

517
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:05,380
You are good at normal jokes too.
Good.

518
00:37:05,653 --> 00:37:08,692
Listen, I like jokers.

519
00:37:08,725 --> 00:37:14,241
But if the joke is on me,
I have to see their end!

520
00:37:15,006 --> 00:37:16,944
I'll start the interview.

521
00:37:17,864 --> 00:37:19,458
First question...

522
00:37:28,075 --> 00:37:31,332
Look, if earning money is my only goal...

523
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:34,014
I'll earn 50 lakhs in 5 years.

524
00:37:34,471 --> 00:37:35,987
Stop blabbering!

525
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:39,219
50 lakhs in 5 years!

526
00:37:39,386 --> 00:37:43,128
Will you kill people,
rob them, or rob banks?

527
00:37:43,153 --> 00:37:45,101
Worthless people do that.

528
00:37:45,476 --> 00:37:47,835
I'll earn 50 lakhs, legally.

529
00:37:48,144 --> 00:37:52,355
I'll prove how easy it is to
earn money for a clever man...

530
00:37:52,435 --> 00:37:54,786
I'll teach a lesson to the rich like you.

531
00:37:54,811 --> 00:37:57,970
If you are that great and
you can do all you say...

532
00:37:57,995 --> 00:38:01,782
-The producer will make a movie with you.
-Yeah, for sure.

533
00:38:02,401 --> 00:38:04,479
Ok, I accept this challenge.

534
00:38:04,736 --> 00:38:06,564
-What about the agreement?
-What!

535
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:10,575
If he fails to stand by his word,
I'll remove the 'Real' from his name.

536
00:38:11,087 --> 00:38:14,532
I promise this as his man...
Now you can go!

537
00:38:14,901 --> 00:38:18,034
You nailed it, Krishna. You nailed it.

538
00:38:18,059 --> 00:38:21,433
Go get those 50 lakhs and I'll
make a movie with you. Go!

539
00:38:24,262 --> 00:38:25,496
Are you in shock?

540
00:38:29,204 --> 00:38:32,673
Your acting inspired me to act as well.

541
00:38:32,698 --> 00:38:36,558
And you fell for it.
Krishna, you are the hero of my film.

542
00:38:38,615 --> 00:38:42,881
-Hail Real Ratnam!
-God! Got me scared!

543
00:38:42,906 --> 00:38:44,640
Idiot! Sillt fellow!

544
00:38:47,941 --> 00:38:51,152
Surya, I give you my word.

545
00:38:51,641 --> 00:38:55,274
Get a real story and I'll
make a movie for sure.

546
00:39:38,165 --> 00:39:41,360
Sir my name is Surya.
I'm a film director, sir.

547
00:39:41,986 --> 00:39:45,556
And I'm the station writer.
Done? Come to the point?

548
00:39:45,994 --> 00:39:47,799
It's nothing, sir...

549
00:39:47,958 --> 00:39:51,575
-I'm searching for a real story to film.
-So what?

550
00:39:52,354 --> 00:39:54,823
You get a lot of cases, right sir?

551
00:39:55,112 --> 00:39:57,526
If you can give me some
interesting ones...

552
00:39:57,709 --> 00:40:00,584
So public problems are
just storylines to you!

553
00:40:00,609 --> 00:40:02,527
-I don't mean that, sir?
-Then what do you mean?

554
00:40:02,552 --> 00:40:05,492
Do you think the police will
sell stories for you?

555
00:40:05,517 --> 00:40:08,781
-I don't mean that too, sir.
-Which channel are you from?

556
00:40:09,087 --> 00:40:11,610
Is this a prank? Where is the camera?

557
00:40:11,635 --> 00:40:15,580
302... Take him in,
strip him, and check.

558
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:19,571
Sir, you are thinking more
weird than us, writers!

559
00:40:19,909 --> 00:40:22,105
-Bye, sir.
-Get lost!

560
00:40:24,729 --> 00:40:26,722
As if this is a story palace!

561
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,347
-Good morning, sir.
-Get me that file.

562
00:41:08,874 --> 00:41:10,140
[song playing on TV]

563
00:41:10,202 --> 00:41:11,788
-Bro.
-Sir...

564
00:41:16,081 --> 00:41:18,003
Do you have a real story with you?

565
00:41:18,028 --> 00:41:20,546
We don't have that brand, sir.
Do you want other brands?

566
00:41:24,063 --> 00:41:26,813
Ok, thank you. Bye!

567
00:41:38,173 --> 00:41:39,985
Tell me, Mr. Journalist.

568
00:41:40,144 --> 00:41:43,183
You asked for a real story, right?

569
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:46,549
I didn't find one and
ended up drinking in a bar.

570
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:49,552
Subba Rao, bill!

571
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:51,653
Do you know about model Rihana?

572
00:41:51,851 --> 00:41:55,382
Hey, I was just looking
at her ad on the TV.

573
00:41:55,765 --> 00:41:58,242
She had a lot of
controversies in her past.

574
00:41:58,908 --> 00:42:01,033
The truth might help you.

575
00:42:01,058 --> 00:42:03,206
Try to meet her once.

576
00:42:03,639 --> 00:42:05,232
Ok, I will try.

577
00:42:54,884 --> 00:42:58,869
Today I'm so excited ma'am.
You are the reason I'm in modelling.

578
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:03,459
And an offer from the company
you are working for... Wow!

579
00:43:03,492 --> 00:43:06,189
Thank you, Ms. Geetha.
Sign this agreement.

580
00:43:06,214 --> 00:43:08,203
I'll forward your
profile to the management.

581
00:43:39,676 --> 00:43:42,301
Hello, excuse me...
I want to meet Rihana ma'am.

582
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:46,056
-Who are you?
-My name is Surya. Director.

583
00:43:46,352 --> 00:43:48,141
Producer Ratnam sent me.

584
00:43:48,166 --> 00:43:51,292
-Ratnam... Real Ratnam?
-Yes.

585
00:43:51,371 --> 00:43:52,519
One minute.

586
00:44:03,003 --> 00:44:04,987
-Ok, sir. You can go now.
-Thank you.

587
00:44:08,674 --> 00:44:10,417
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hi, Surya.

588
00:44:10,798 --> 00:44:11,931
Thank you.

589
00:44:14,268 --> 00:44:16,799
-Tell me, Surya.
-That's...

590
00:44:17,726 --> 00:44:21,796
Feel free. If you are not convenient
here, let's sit outside.

591
00:44:21,821 --> 00:44:24,481
It's ok. I'm comfortable.

592
00:44:25,314 --> 00:44:26,689
Sorry, madam...

593
00:44:26,928 --> 00:44:30,209
To meet you,
I lied that Real Ratnam sir sent me.

594
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:34,750
It's common that directors
lie for movie chances.

595
00:44:34,906 --> 00:44:37,086
No no. I know him, ma'am.

596
00:44:37,438 --> 00:44:40,782
He gave me his word that he will make
a movie if I get him a good story.

597
00:44:41,068 --> 00:44:44,943
Then why are you meeting me
without preparing a story?

598
00:44:45,617 --> 00:44:48,000
-You have to narrate that story, ma'am.
-What?

599
00:44:52,339 --> 00:44:56,807
There have been rumors on some
incidents that happened in your life.

600
00:45:04,722 --> 00:45:08,448
If you tell me the truth,
I can make it into a movie.

601
00:45:09,588 --> 00:45:12,088
Is this your idea? Or Real Ratnam's?

602
00:45:12,113 --> 00:45:14,714
He had nothing to do with this, ma'am.

603
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:17,312
I wanted to meet you.

604
00:45:17,337 --> 00:45:20,185
-Bad idea, Surya.
-Please don't say that, ma'am.

605
00:45:20,641 --> 00:45:23,368
If you don't answer the
public about the rumors...

606
00:45:23,635 --> 00:45:25,573
They keep thinking that they are true.

607
00:45:28,029 --> 00:45:30,373
If we present it as a movie...

608
00:45:31,282 --> 00:45:35,508
We can tell them the truth,
along with great publicity for you.

609
00:45:36,425 --> 00:45:37,761
Please think of it, ma'am.

610
00:45:37,786 --> 00:45:41,564
People are paying to
get their bio-pics done.

611
00:45:42,348 --> 00:45:45,372
But someone is planning
to invest on your story...

612
00:45:54,452 --> 00:45:55,741
This is my number, ma'am.

613
00:46:06,259 --> 00:46:08,986
If you don't answer the
public about the rumors...

614
00:46:09,253 --> 00:46:11,191
They keep thinking that they are true.

615
00:46:11,764 --> 00:46:14,108
If we present it as a movie...

616
00:46:15,232 --> 00:46:19,458
We can tell them the truth,
along with great publicity for you.

617
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:26,156
I thought of it a lot, Surya.

618
00:46:26,226 --> 00:46:30,366
But.. I have no idea
what decision to take!

619
00:46:31,016 --> 00:46:34,860
Think of it, ma'am. This movie
is equally important to us both.

620
00:46:34,885 --> 00:46:38,171
But Surya... Telling my story...

621
00:46:38,196 --> 00:46:41,575
People might say that
I'm doing it sympathy.

622
00:46:43,352 --> 00:46:45,914
I already have a lot of
dark corners in my life.

623
00:46:46,327 --> 00:46:48,358
Until people who peak
into our lives exist...

624
00:46:48,942 --> 00:46:51,364
We all have dark corners
in our lives, ma'am.

625
00:46:52,129 --> 00:46:54,020
To remove that darkness...

626
00:46:54,442 --> 00:46:57,575
We have to turn those people
into those who wait for us.

627
00:47:01,373 --> 00:47:03,412
Tell your story and forget about it.

628
00:47:03,881 --> 00:47:06,920
You'll only have fans from now on...
No enemies!

629
00:47:09,955 --> 00:47:13,166
Rahul and Bobby are really close friends.

630
00:47:14,956 --> 00:47:20,018
Rahul... I don't know why,
I liked him right at the first sight.

631
00:47:20,716 --> 00:47:24,911
For no reason, I felt like he's mine.

632
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:28,746
Luck favoured my feelings.

633
00:47:28,873 --> 00:47:32,271
I went to his college as a guest.

634
00:47:32,389 --> 00:47:36,014
It's been a reason for
me to like him even more.

635
00:47:36,694 --> 00:47:39,616
I don't know if God
listened to my feelings...

636
00:47:39,641 --> 00:47:42,542
Or if Rahul did... I don't know...

637
00:47:43,216 --> 00:47:46,598
He had become a lot close to me.

638
00:47:48,057 --> 00:47:51,643
At that point,
I wanted nothing more in my life.

639
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:55,480
Rahul and me...
And that's my whole life.

640
00:47:59,145 --> 00:48:03,763
But I never thought that such a bad
incident would take place in my life.

641
00:48:06,243 --> 00:48:08,696
Why did you stop at the main point?

642
00:48:08,953 --> 00:48:11,414
What happened next?
Why is she crying?

643
00:48:11,439 --> 00:48:16,208
Rihana turns back to see her nude
photos displaying on the screen.

644
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:20,137
-And that's the interval point, sir.
-Wow!

645
00:48:20,509 --> 00:48:23,524
-First-class! Great interval!
-Yeah.

646
00:48:23,549 --> 00:48:25,592
-Double profit guarantee.
-Thank you, sir.

647
00:48:25,617 --> 00:48:28,306
What happened next? Tell me.
I'm really tensed.

648
00:48:28,331 --> 00:48:30,799
Go on. If he dies of tension,
who will make this film?

649
00:48:31,093 --> 00:48:33,561
I'm tensed as it's a real story.

650
00:48:33,762 --> 00:48:36,020
I'll teach you a lesson
after the narration!

651
00:48:36,639 --> 00:48:40,186
So Rahul and Bobby are
the reason for all that...

652
00:48:40,307 --> 00:48:42,604
And it happened just
because they cheated her...

653
00:48:42,629 --> 00:48:45,293
This is what Rihana complained in
the police station against them.

654
00:48:45,591 --> 00:48:48,778
What came out in the police
investigation is that...

655
00:48:49,107 --> 00:48:52,693
One of them is dead and
the other went missing.

656
00:48:52,979 --> 00:48:55,330
And we will project this
differently in the movie.

657
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:59,144
'What's the relation between
Rahul, Rihana, and Bobby'?

658
00:48:59,618 --> 00:49:01,274
Wow!

659
00:49:02,092 --> 00:49:06,943
That's ok... Will Rihana act
in this story under my banner?

660
00:49:06,968 --> 00:49:10,713
As I talked little bad with her when
she's at the peaks of her career.

661
00:49:11,772 --> 00:49:14,530
She told me the same, sir.
I'll take care of it.

662
00:49:14,555 --> 00:49:16,990
You are strong! You got it done!

663
00:49:17,033 --> 00:49:18,268
When will we meet Rihana?

664
00:49:18,369 --> 00:49:22,205
What 'When', sir?
She's coming to our office.

665
00:49:22,343 --> 00:49:24,101
What! Twist after twist!

666
00:49:28,068 --> 00:49:30,326
-Sir!
-There she is.

667
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,113
-Hi!
-Hi!

668
00:49:33,138 --> 00:49:37,827
Rihana madam in my office!
Welcome welcome!

669
00:49:37,917 --> 00:49:41,009
Please sit!

670
00:49:45,714 --> 00:49:49,658
-How are you, Real Ratnam?
-Same old sweetness in your voice!

671
00:49:50,078 --> 00:49:52,617
-I'm great. Look...
-Sir.

672
00:49:52,642 --> 00:49:55,917
I don't know how,
arrange a demo shoot day after tomorrow.

673
00:49:55,942 --> 00:49:59,487
-What about our hero?
-God! I'll take care of all that.

674
00:49:59,803 --> 00:50:03,865
On this occasion, I'm throwing a dinner
party for our team tomorrow night.

675
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:06,177
We'll stay there and the
next morning we shoot a demo.

676
00:50:06,202 --> 00:50:08,441
-Take care of the arrangements.
-Ok.

677
00:50:08,466 --> 00:50:10,619
She should not feel uncomfortable, ok?

678
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:13,723
-Ok, sir.
-Stop drooling, you fool!

679
00:50:14,328 --> 00:50:16,781
You too didn't change, sir.
The same old josh!

680
00:50:17,947 --> 00:50:21,354
-I never change.
-Ok, Ratnam sir.

681
00:50:21,612 --> 00:50:23,315
Let's make a movie.

682
00:50:29,094 --> 00:50:31,922
-Stop! Stop...
-Here?

683
00:50:31,947 --> 00:50:33,709
-Stop!
-What for?

684
00:50:35,169 --> 00:50:37,044
-What happened?
-You leave, I'll come.

685
00:50:37,115 --> 00:50:38,849
-You won't come with me?
-No. You go.

686
00:50:38,874 --> 00:50:39,920
Ok.

687
00:50:48,065 --> 00:50:51,214
You made fun of me knowing that I
don't know how to play, right?

688
00:50:51,239 --> 00:50:54,677
You said cups and medals, right?
I got scared and so encouraged you!

689
00:50:54,702 --> 00:50:56,238
You...

690
00:51:06,490 --> 00:51:08,365
-What?
-That's...

691
00:51:08,461 --> 00:51:11,008
You didn't hide anything
else from me, right?

692
00:51:12,598 --> 00:51:13,973
Yeah, Ok. I'm coming.

693
00:51:20,193 --> 00:51:21,443
[phone rings]

694
00:51:23,016 --> 00:51:25,626
-Tell me, Raghu.
-Krishna, you have become a hero.

695
00:51:26,063 --> 00:51:27,814
Stop joking and come to the point.

696
00:51:28,338 --> 00:51:31,213
No joking! Our producer got the
story and you are the hero in it.

697
00:51:31,238 --> 00:51:34,118
-What are you saying?
-Come to room at once. Let's talk.

698
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:35,556
Ok? Bye!

699
00:51:36,759 --> 00:51:39,650
Seems like a good news!
The hero is smiling.

700
00:51:39,975 --> 00:51:42,475
Of course, I got a chance as a hero.

701
00:51:45,803 --> 00:51:48,467
I keep listening to only
good news when I'm with you.

702
00:51:48,567 --> 00:51:50,771
Let's go.
I have to give you a treat today.

703
00:51:52,084 --> 00:51:53,952
[inaudible]

704
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:25,960
Hey!

705
00:52:33,571 --> 00:52:36,212
-Sorry, boss!
-We are extremely sorry.

706
00:52:36,505 --> 00:52:38,653
Sorry, Krishna.
It happened because of me.

707
00:52:38,678 --> 00:52:40,374
It's ok, let me talk to them.

708
00:52:40,626 --> 00:52:43,032
Why don't you disturb us?

709
00:52:43,479 --> 00:52:46,455
Boss, please... No!

710
00:52:47,405 --> 00:52:48,780
Get lost!

711
00:52:50,583 --> 00:52:51,724
Krishna!

712
00:52:55,614 --> 00:52:58,911
Hit me anywhere you want...
but not on the face, boss!

713
00:54:47,892 --> 00:54:48,939
Krishna...

714
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:52,942
I don't know anyone here.
Why did you bring me?

715
00:54:53,262 --> 00:54:56,488
I too don't know anyone here.
That's why I brought you!

716
00:54:57,978 --> 00:55:00,525
Shruthi, why are you so scared?

717
00:55:01,201 --> 00:55:03,826
No one will say anything.
I'm here, right?

718
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:08,301
I can clearly hear how
much you are scolding me.

719
00:55:12,114 --> 00:55:15,114
Rihana is here. Go get the bouquet.

720
00:55:15,139 --> 00:55:16,363
Sir...

721
00:55:16,983 --> 00:55:19,296
-Madam...
-Stop!

722
00:55:19,723 --> 00:55:22,676
Thank you, Rihana! Thank you.

723
00:55:22,701 --> 00:55:24,531
-Thank you!
-Careful with the bouquet.

724
00:55:24,556 --> 00:55:28,217
-Shut up! Please come.
-Stop hugging after handing bouquets.

725
00:55:32,114 --> 00:55:33,396
Thanks, brother.

726
00:55:37,468 --> 00:55:39,164
God, she seems hot!

727
00:55:42,044 --> 00:55:44,482
Do you think you have
already become a hero to come late?

728
00:55:44,827 --> 00:55:47,108
Nice coat! Got it on rent, right?
Ok, come on.

729
00:55:48,413 --> 00:55:49,632
Come!

730
00:55:54,483 --> 00:55:57,702
You are already late and now
you are staring at the ladies!

731
00:55:58,075 --> 00:56:00,762
It felt like I know her really well, sir.

732
00:56:00,787 --> 00:56:03,571
This is why men are being destroyed.

733
00:56:07,868 --> 00:56:10,900
-Who's that girl?
-That's what I'm looking for, sir.

734
00:56:11,105 --> 00:56:12,668
Hi, Krishna.

735
00:56:13,164 --> 00:56:15,953
Our hero... Mr. Surya, our director.

736
00:56:15,978 --> 00:56:17,185
-Hi!
-Hi!

737
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:19,846
Raghu, who's this madam?

738
00:56:19,871 --> 00:56:22,416
-Introduce her.
-That's Shruthi. Krishna's friend.

739
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:25,664
She's already acting in three movies.
I invited her to introduce to you.

740
00:56:28,689 --> 00:56:31,275
Touch had a feel in it.
Face has beauty on it.

741
00:56:31,479 --> 00:56:34,026
And you have a great future.

742
00:56:34,195 --> 00:56:36,390
Let's announce our future project first.

743
00:56:36,415 --> 00:56:38,788
-Oh, yes. Let's do it.
-You have to let her go first.

744
00:56:39,374 --> 00:56:40,601
Correct!

745
00:56:41,007 --> 00:56:43,492
I'll do it. Yes. I will.

746
00:56:44,011 --> 00:56:46,082
You look so beautiful!

747
00:56:46,107 --> 00:56:50,644
One can write 10 stories on your
eyes and 20 on your smile, easy!

748
00:56:50,669 --> 00:56:52,298
Wow!

749
00:56:56,731 --> 00:57:01,106
I'll meet you after the announcement.
Enjoy the party meanwhile.

750
00:57:01,625 --> 00:57:03,164
-Bye!
-Bye.

751
00:57:03,189 --> 00:57:05,271
-Such beauty!
-What happened to him suddenly?

752
00:57:06,046 --> 00:57:08,374
Seems like he's so loose!

753
00:57:09,416 --> 00:57:12,369
Krishna... Your director...

754
00:57:12,394 --> 00:57:15,175
He seems like he'll make
a movie with me first.

755
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,930
-Yeah.
-Keep him under control.

756
00:57:17,150 --> 00:57:18,377
Of course!

757
00:57:20,039 --> 00:57:21,430
My dear friends...

758
00:57:22,081 --> 00:57:25,823
Thank you so much for
being here with us today.

759
00:57:25,848 --> 00:57:30,491
Our Real Entertainments will entertain
you with real stories as always.

760
00:57:31,527 --> 00:57:33,917
Even this time,
we are coming with a real story.

761
00:57:34,373 --> 00:57:37,818
A really good movie, titled 'Plan B'.

762
00:57:38,537 --> 00:57:40,201
The sole reason behind this...

763
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:43,815
Ms. Rihana!

764
00:57:53,759 --> 00:57:56,095
-When will he call me?
-He will.

765
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:58,262
I'm the director and he
don't even care about me.

766
00:57:58,805 --> 00:58:00,415
You are nothing for him!

767
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:01,946
Give a big applause!

768
00:58:03,696 --> 00:58:06,618
We'll announce the
remaining details soon.

769
00:58:07,364 --> 00:58:11,277
Now enjoy your dinner. Thank you!

770
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:13,271
Let's go eat.

771
00:58:14,375 --> 00:58:15,633
Look at his face!

772
00:58:19,335 --> 00:58:21,382
-[knock on door]
-Come in.

773
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:27,963
-Hi, dear!
-Hi, sir.

774
00:58:28,315 --> 00:58:31,573
-Everything good?
-Yeah, fine, sir.

775
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:32,957
Thank you, dear.

776
00:58:33,748 --> 00:58:36,732
-Are you busy?
-No. Just makeup removal.

777
00:58:36,757 --> 00:58:38,944
Ok ok... He is Krishna...

778
00:58:39,152 --> 00:58:41,159
We are introducing him as
a hero through our movie.

779
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:43,691
-Just want you to meet him.
-Hi, Krishna.

780
00:58:43,832 --> 00:58:44,871
Hi, ma'am.

781
00:58:46,555 --> 00:58:48,922
Enough of staring.
Will you sleep here or what?

782
00:58:49,099 --> 00:58:51,451
-No, sir.
-Let her take some rest. Let's go.

783
00:58:53,612 --> 00:58:54,901
-Move!
-Ok, sir.

784
00:58:54,926 --> 00:58:56,549
-Bye, dear.
-Bye, sir.

785
00:58:57,930 --> 00:58:59,117
Bye!

786
00:59:00,012 --> 00:59:02,699
-Hello, sir.
-Where are you going?

787
00:59:02,842 --> 00:59:05,178
To narrate the story to Rihana, sir.

788
00:59:05,425 --> 00:59:08,902
He's the one who gave you the story.
Do you need to narrate it back to her?

789
00:59:09,022 --> 00:59:11,061
We have to explain the scene
order, right sir?

790
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:15,529
Tell him instead. Develop him.
He looks sharp.

791
00:59:15,554 --> 00:59:17,388
-All the best, Krishna.
-Thank you, sir.

792
00:59:20,616 --> 00:59:22,733
Hello, he's gone.
You can stand straight.

793
00:59:23,482 --> 00:59:25,411
Tell me, director sir...

794
00:59:25,436 --> 00:59:28,162
See... You won't suit my story, brother!

795
00:59:28,794 --> 00:59:31,364
If I tell him the same,
he says he gave you his word.

796
00:59:31,747 --> 00:59:33,223
What's your problem, brother?

797
00:59:33,248 --> 00:59:35,591
You won't set into my story, brother.

798
00:59:36,104 --> 00:59:40,190
All those who heard 'You won't set',
are the ones who set the industry today.

799
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:44,335
Tomorrow I'll see
about your confidence levels!

800
00:59:45,374 --> 00:59:47,187
Don't touch that point, brother.

801
00:59:47,704 --> 00:59:49,923
It's at least a foot higher than Everest.

802
00:59:49,948 --> 00:59:51,850
-All the best!
-Thank you!

803
00:59:59,177 --> 01:00:00,521
PLAN - B. THE UNTOLD STORY!

804
01:00:08,013 --> 01:00:09,474
Heroine staff?

805
01:00:13,327 --> 01:00:14,600
Ok ok.

806
01:00:15,085 --> 01:00:18,523
Caravan... Why do you need one?
We have this huge guest house, right?

807
01:00:18,736 --> 01:00:20,337
Artists recommended it, sir.

808
01:00:20,362 --> 01:00:21,916
-We have to manage them.
-Ok, sir.

809
01:00:21,941 --> 01:00:23,564
You can say that I said so.

810
01:00:24,998 --> 01:00:27,678
-He's not here yet?
-No.

811
01:00:27,703 --> 01:00:30,833
I didn't disturb him, as today is
his first day. He might be tensed.

812
01:00:30,858 --> 01:00:32,897
Tension and shyness won't make you a hero.

813
01:00:33,211 --> 01:00:35,015
-Go call him.
-Ok, sir.

814
01:00:39,391 --> 01:00:42,896
Krishna... you are not a hero yet.
Come out.

815
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:45,995
That's not the way. Let me call him.

816
01:00:46,713 --> 01:00:48,690
Move!

817
01:00:50,387 --> 01:00:54,793
Dear Krishna... This is Real Ratnam...
Please come out.

818
01:00:55,338 --> 01:00:56,346
He will.

819
01:00:56,974 --> 01:00:58,958
Krishna, please come out.

820
01:00:59,561 --> 01:01:00,826
-Is he here?
-No.

821
01:01:00,851 --> 01:01:02,010
Call him.

822
01:01:04,818 --> 01:01:06,060
Sir, script.

823
01:01:12,558 --> 01:01:13,925
-Krishna!
-What happened?

824
01:01:13,950 --> 01:01:16,755
I think he's sleeping.
Two minutes, ma'am. He'll come out.

825
01:01:17,099 --> 01:01:20,099
Sleeping at this time?
Had he gone mad? Krishna!

826
01:01:20,124 --> 01:01:22,772
Krishna! Where did you get him from?

827
01:01:22,797 --> 01:01:24,894
Let me try. Krishna...

828
01:01:25,445 --> 01:01:27,820
Are you there? Krishna!

829
01:01:48,109 --> 01:01:49,438
Forgive me Rihana.

830
01:01:51,169 --> 01:01:53,302
I did a huge mistake!

831
01:01:56,287 --> 01:01:57,904
The mistake is mine.

832
01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:02,912
I shouldn't have done so that day.

833
01:02:03,051 --> 01:02:06,426
You are mine. No one can seperate us.

834
01:02:16,118 --> 01:02:19,071
-What's happening?
-Pack up!

835
01:02:20,274 --> 01:02:22,204
Sir, no!

836
01:02:23,401 --> 01:02:26,823
You brought him, right?
I'll teach you a lesson.

837
01:02:27,678 --> 01:02:28,803
You...

838
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:45,794
PLAN - B. THE UNTOLD STORY!

839
01:02:45,949 --> 01:02:48,754
Plan - B. The untold story.

840
01:02:51,592 --> 01:02:55,061
I don't know why... But I liked
him at very first sight...

841
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:04,153
Bobby...

842
01:03:28,592 --> 01:03:30,849
You didn't understand even
a single scene, right?

843
01:03:30,874 --> 01:03:32,381
How will I?

844
01:03:32,807 --> 01:03:36,002
-Am I Rahul or Bobby?
-Sorry, I forgot to tell you.

845
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:38,169
-You are Rahul.
-Hmm, ok.

846
01:03:49,144 --> 01:03:52,331
-What?
-Who's acting as Bobby?

847
01:03:53,235 --> 01:03:54,399
Whom should I imagine?

848
01:03:54,424 --> 01:03:57,539
Some fool! Do you need that?
Read your scenes.

849
01:03:58,097 --> 01:04:00,472
-I'll imagine you.
-Yeah, go away!

850
01:04:04,827 --> 01:04:08,804
Rahul... I don't know why... But I
liked him at very first sight...

851
01:04:12,913 --> 01:04:14,733
Yes! I'm Rahul.

852
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:19,135
Come on, Rahul! Come on!

853
01:04:24,421 --> 01:04:26,983
-Hey!
-Please leave me.

854
01:04:27,611 --> 01:04:30,369
-Please!
-Give it...

855
01:04:46,379 --> 01:04:50,512
â™ªMy heart said that you are my life.â™ª

856
01:04:50,537 --> 01:04:52,909
All done with social service? Let's go.

857
01:04:53,504 --> 01:04:55,707
Saving a girl is not social service.

858
01:04:55,732 --> 01:04:58,040
Killing someone like you is!

859
01:04:58,065 --> 01:05:01,323
â™ªMy feelings are singing for you.â™ª

860
01:05:01,348 --> 01:05:03,250
Do you want to come to a pub with me?

861
01:05:03,789 --> 01:05:05,797
-Yeah, I will.
-Ok.

862
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:07,916
[phone rings]

863
01:05:08,898 --> 01:05:10,546
-Hello!-Rahul, where are you?

864
01:05:10,571 --> 01:05:12,068
-Rihana is here.
-Is it?

865
01:05:21,555 --> 01:05:24,500
I saw a guy in your college today.

866
01:05:24,796 --> 01:05:26,617
As he saved a girl.

867
01:05:28,599 --> 01:05:32,826
Actually,
I'm a huge fan of him from now on.

868
01:05:33,905 --> 01:05:37,577
â™ªTell me all that you have to.â™ª

869
01:05:37,752 --> 01:05:41,682
â™ªTell me all your secrets.â™ª

870
01:05:41,831 --> 01:05:45,909
â™ªJust open up your heart, that you
are trying to hide all these days.â™ª

871
01:06:01,497 --> 01:06:03,598
-Rahul!
-Hey, hi!

872
01:06:05,191 --> 01:06:06,910
-What's the late?
-Traffic!

873
01:06:06,935 --> 01:06:09,917
-I have been waiting for you.
-Hey, hi!

874
01:06:11,027 --> 01:06:13,324
-Hi!
-I will be back. See you.

875
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,793
Who's she? New case?

876
01:06:15,818 --> 01:06:17,714
Let it go. Want a drink?

877
01:06:18,069 --> 01:06:20,217
No. Ok, forget about this case.

878
01:06:20,242 --> 01:06:22,264
What about our case
in the police station?

879
01:06:22,289 --> 01:06:24,814
Man! This is not what you
talk about in a pub.

880
01:06:24,948 --> 01:06:26,564
Enjoy! Chill!

881
01:06:26,589 --> 01:06:29,248
-Yes.
-'Yes'? Come sit.

882
01:06:33,176 --> 01:06:35,082
Hey, that's Rihana.

883
01:06:35,107 --> 01:06:38,138
You still care about her? Lite!

884
01:06:38,163 --> 01:06:39,927
-Come sit.
-Wait.

885
01:06:39,952 --> 01:06:42,550
-Why are you even here?
-Let me meet her once.

886
01:06:42,575 --> 01:06:45,167
-That's Rihana!
-Ok, go.

887
01:06:46,550 --> 01:06:48,722
Hey, hi! Hi!

888
01:06:49,164 --> 01:06:50,570
This is Rahul.

889
01:06:52,322 --> 01:06:56,314
In the college yesterday... You
interacted with the students, remember?

890
01:06:56,339 --> 01:07:00,167
-And... Fight!
-Hey... Rahul!

891
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:02,378
Hi!

892
01:07:07,212 --> 01:07:09,274
I am a huge fan of you.

893
01:07:10,430 --> 01:07:11,836
Let's dance.

894
01:07:13,417 --> 01:07:15,378
Why are you looking like that?

895
01:07:15,936 --> 01:07:17,928
Don't you like dancing with me?

896
01:07:18,421 --> 01:07:21,663
No no, nothing like that.
Meeting you here so suddenly...

897
01:07:21,688 --> 01:07:23,423
It's surprising!

898
01:07:24,328 --> 01:07:27,500
I can't believe that
I'm dancing with you.

899
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:29,643
If it's that surprising...

900
01:07:29,668 --> 01:07:31,231
Let's not meet again.

901
01:07:32,203 --> 01:07:33,359
Nothing like that...

902
01:07:34,562 --> 01:07:37,578
For now... Now I met you this way!

903
01:07:37,792 --> 01:07:40,737
Now I'll plan tomororws.
Tell me, where shall we meet tomorrow?

904
01:07:43,407 --> 01:07:46,899
Fans shouldn't ask.
They have to inquire, come, and meet.

905
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:48,881
Ok?

906
01:07:52,387 --> 01:07:53,911
Ok!

907
01:07:58,238 --> 01:08:00,565
-I'm so sorry!
-It's ok.

908
01:08:00,590 --> 01:08:01,809
Sorry!

909
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:04,647
-I'll be back.
-Yeah, ok.

910
01:08:14,810 --> 01:08:16,974
-There is a girl here, right?
-No, bro!

911
01:08:34,814 --> 01:08:37,721
-What?
-I can't find Rihana.

912
01:08:38,395 --> 01:08:39,755
She's gone.

913
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:42,149
What mood I'm in and
what are you talking about?

914
01:08:42,174 --> 01:08:43,478
God!

915
01:08:44,907 --> 01:08:46,063
Chill!

916
01:08:47,205 --> 01:08:48,549
Chill!

917
01:08:48,796 --> 01:08:51,468
-Hey!
-Please find her somehow.

918
01:08:51,493 --> 01:08:54,127
-Please!
-I'm here to get you to her. Let's go.

919
01:08:54,421 --> 01:08:56,421
MAREDUMILLI

920
01:09:29,004 --> 01:09:32,332
Will take a little more time, madam.
Read the script meanwhile.

921
01:09:40,750 --> 01:09:42,289
Yeah cool. Will do it.

922
01:09:47,639 --> 01:09:48,936
What else, sir?

923
01:09:58,577 --> 01:10:00,921
-Let's start after the break, madam.
-Ok.

924
01:10:04,348 --> 01:10:05,622
Hey, please come.

925
01:10:09,394 --> 01:10:10,832
-Hi!
-Hey!

926
01:10:12,970 --> 01:10:16,306
How did you come to know that I'm here?

927
01:10:16,885 --> 01:10:18,182
My friend Bobby...

928
01:10:19,540 --> 01:10:22,665
He's a model coordinator.
I got him...

929
01:10:22,887 --> 01:10:24,356
And he got your manager.

930
01:10:25,866 --> 01:10:27,131
Problem clear.

931
01:10:28,223 --> 01:10:29,762
You worked hard!

932
01:10:29,907 --> 01:10:33,472
We boys usually know where the
girl we are in love with.

933
01:10:35,486 --> 01:10:38,478
And if the girl challenges us...
How can we let that slide?

934
01:10:39,817 --> 01:10:41,364
Prestige issue, madam!

935
01:10:41,389 --> 01:10:44,731
Do you impress girls
like this all the time?

936
01:10:44,756 --> 01:10:47,840
Girls these days are getting
impressed only to lies.

937
01:10:47,865 --> 01:10:49,336
Turth is not working, right?

938
01:10:49,361 --> 01:10:51,398
-Idiot!
-See?

939
01:10:52,133 --> 01:10:54,047
You just believed a lie.

940
01:10:54,118 --> 01:10:55,790
But not the truth.

941
01:10:56,124 --> 01:10:57,468
-And...
-Excuse me, ma'am.

942
01:10:58,268 --> 01:11:00,218
-Your night stay is arranged here, madam.
-Ok.

943
01:11:00,243 --> 01:11:02,523
Vizag shedule is planned
in the next 3 - 4 days.

944
01:11:02,548 --> 01:11:03,613
Ok.

945
01:11:05,626 --> 01:11:07,337
Ok, I'm leaving.

946
01:11:07,633 --> 01:11:09,063
Hey, wait.

947
01:11:09,835 --> 01:11:12,476
You are here anyway.
Let's spend some time together.

948
01:11:14,849 --> 01:11:18,731
â™ªThe full moon in the night sky...â™ª

949
01:11:18,756 --> 01:11:22,597
â™ªHe's been waiting for you.
Did you see him?â™ª

950
01:11:22,747 --> 01:11:26,708
â™ªThe anklets fell very happy seeing you.â™ª

951
01:11:26,748 --> 01:11:30,523
â™ªDid you hear them
make noise of joy?â™ª

952
01:11:30,578 --> 01:11:34,492
â™ªDid you hear them
make noise of joy?â™ª

953
01:11:34,806 --> 01:11:38,110
â™ªDid you hear...â™ª

954
01:11:38,189 --> 01:11:42,673
â™ªMy feelings came running to
take shade under your love.â™ª

955
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:46,464
â™ªWhy don't you take them in...â™ª

956
01:11:46,489 --> 01:11:50,435
â™ªDid you hear that?â™ª

957
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:54,408
â™ªDid you?â™ª

958
01:11:54,433 --> 01:11:58,730
â™ªThis youth had broken all the chains.â™ª

959
01:11:58,755 --> 01:12:02,650
â™ªWhy don't you tie them back?â™ª

960
01:12:02,675 --> 01:12:06,102
â™ªDid you hear?â™ª

961
01:12:33,384 --> 01:12:35,150
So? All cool!

962
01:12:35,424 --> 01:12:37,799
-Yeah.
-What else, Rahul? Tell me.

963
01:12:38,028 --> 01:12:39,653
[phone rings]

964
01:12:57,970 --> 01:12:59,337
-Hello?-Hello!

965
01:12:59,362 --> 01:13:01,894
Can't you be without
me at least for a day?

966
01:13:02,165 --> 01:13:04,344
One minute, SI sir will talk to you.

967
01:13:04,665 --> 01:13:06,126
SI sir?

968
01:13:06,665 --> 01:13:08,900
-Sir, tell me, sir.-Is this new to you or what?

969
01:13:08,925 --> 01:13:11,247
-Don't you know you have to sign?
-Nothing like that, sir.

970
01:13:11,543 --> 01:13:14,348
I couldn't make it as I'm
on some personal work.

971
01:13:14,903 --> 01:13:16,387
I'll be there in two hours.

972
01:13:19,345 --> 01:13:22,384
-What? Any problem?
-Nothing!

973
01:13:22,409 --> 01:13:24,837
-Normal!
-Seem personal.

974
01:13:25,043 --> 01:13:26,340
It's ok.

975
01:13:27,469 --> 01:13:28,875
Nothing personal...

976
01:13:29,183 --> 01:13:32,987
Why to disturb you for nothing?
That's it!

977
01:13:35,390 --> 01:13:39,312
My friend got caught in
a girl's case last month.

978
01:13:39,804 --> 01:13:43,601
The police booked a case
and I got him out on bail.

979
01:13:44,206 --> 01:13:47,276
So weekly once,
we both have to go sign at the station.

980
01:13:47,410 --> 01:13:48,488
What?

981
01:13:48,778 --> 01:13:50,848
Be careful with such people.

982
01:13:50,987 --> 01:13:52,940
No no... He's a good guy.

983
01:13:52,965 --> 01:13:56,097
But he got caught in women
escorting cases recently.

984
01:13:58,181 --> 01:13:59,298
Ok!

985
01:14:01,663 --> 01:14:03,413
-Ok, let's go?
-Yeah!

986
01:14:29,707 --> 01:14:32,418
There are lot of cases on you.
Be careful!

987
01:14:32,443 --> 01:14:34,025
Ok, sir. Bye!

988
01:14:35,217 --> 01:14:36,459
Ok, sir.

989
01:14:38,947 --> 01:14:41,939
What's with you?
Why don't you respond to my calls?

990
01:14:41,964 --> 01:14:44,651
What happened now? All ok, right? Cool!

991
01:14:44,676 --> 01:14:46,723
What 'Cool'? Did you even look at him?

992
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,886
He would have thrashed me!

993
01:14:49,261 --> 01:14:53,875
Sorry, dude.
As Rihana forced me to stay... I did.

994
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:55,921
Rihana?

995
01:14:56,461 --> 01:14:57,813
I have to fill you in. Let's go.

996
01:15:19,912 --> 01:15:23,428
I told you everything, right?
Your mood still didn't change? Let's go.

997
01:15:24,257 --> 01:15:27,320
You go. I have some work.
I'll come back in an hour.

998
01:15:31,065 --> 01:15:33,261
Go to a bar or pub to chill.

999
01:15:33,286 --> 01:15:34,497
But not to a girl.

1000
01:15:35,089 --> 01:15:38,003
Ok, sir. You get down
and I'll do as you say.

1001
01:15:38,028 --> 01:15:39,293
Ok.

1002
01:15:49,198 --> 01:15:52,995
[not reachable tone]

1003
01:16:01,132 --> 01:16:02,624
Hello, Rahul!

1004
01:16:03,973 --> 01:16:05,434
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1005
01:16:06,777 --> 01:16:08,472
Full tired!

1006
01:16:14,252 --> 01:16:16,400
Sir seems so hungry!

1007
01:16:19,544 --> 01:16:20,630
Is it?

1008
01:16:22,122 --> 01:16:23,887
WANT SOMETHING SPICY

1009
01:16:23,949 --> 01:16:24,973
No!

1010
01:16:29,630 --> 01:16:31,794

1012
01:16:59,831 --> 01:17:00,987
Hey!

1013
01:17:02,218 --> 01:17:05,093
-Oh my, lovely Teddy!
-Rihana...

1014
01:17:05,118 --> 01:17:07,738
Cool cool! Why so happy?

1015
01:17:08,622 --> 01:17:11,583
I'm the winner of Most
Emerging Model of the year.

1016
01:17:11,608 --> 01:17:13,779
Wow! Congrats, Reena!

1017
01:17:14,082 --> 01:17:15,199
Thank you!

1018
01:17:15,944 --> 01:17:19,546
Only after you came into my life...
All these things are happening to me.

1019
01:17:20,383 --> 01:17:22,015
-Love you!
-Love you!

1020
01:17:23,587 --> 01:17:25,173
-Oh, sorry!
-What happened?

1021
01:17:25,198 --> 01:17:26,911
Seems like your friend is here.

1022
01:17:26,936 --> 01:17:28,365
No one is here.

1023
01:17:28,459 --> 01:17:32,248
Ok... Isn't there a party to
celebrate this happy moment?

1024
01:17:33,078 --> 01:17:36,719
Come... I'll give you
a real strong... party!

1025
01:17:37,051 --> 01:17:40,156
So let's invite Rihana
Das on to the dias.

1026
01:17:40,181 --> 01:17:42,023
-All the best!
-I'm so happy today.

1027
01:17:42,049 --> 01:17:44,486
Thanks for everyone
who made this happen.

1028
01:17:44,726 --> 01:17:47,234
When you choose a
profession as your career...

1029
01:17:47,259 --> 01:17:49,441
First believe in yourself.

1030
01:17:49,466 --> 01:17:51,219
Then try to go get it.

1031
01:17:51,594 --> 01:17:53,086
I did the same.

Listening to what you said...

1037
01:18:41,195 --> 01:18:43,312
It seems like he did this on purpose.

1038
01:18:43,337 --> 01:18:46,367
Not just him, sir. His friend Bobby too.

1039
01:18:47,270 --> 01:18:50,161
There are many women harassing
cases on Bobby already.

1040
01:18:50,913 --> 01:18:53,624
Now they both spoiled my life!

1041
01:18:53,756 --> 01:18:56,280
Ok, I'll catch them somehow.

1042
01:18:57,060 --> 01:18:59,122
-And will inform you.
-Thank you, sir.

1043
01:19:01,358 --> 01:19:04,069
Now they both spoiled my life!

1044
01:19:05,150 --> 01:19:06,509
Krishna...

1045
01:19:07,799 --> 01:19:11,479
Move! Dear Krishna...

1046
01:19:11,504 --> 01:19:13,810
This is Real Ratnam...

1047
01:19:13,835 --> 01:19:15,741
Please come out!

1048
01:19:16,547 --> 01:19:19,609
Krishna, are you there?

1049
01:19:20,749 --> 01:19:21,827
Krishna!

1050
01:19:31,978 --> 01:19:35,017
Do you think you are Himesh Reshammiya
to kiss her in the very first scene?

1051
01:19:35,042 --> 01:19:37,347
I have no idea what I'm doing!

1052
01:19:39,010 --> 01:19:41,956
Shruthi... I didn't do it on purpose.

1053
01:19:42,283 --> 01:19:44,947
I have no idea why I did that.

1054
01:19:46,044 --> 01:19:47,646
Only if you have it in your heart...

1055
01:19:47,671 --> 01:19:49,968
You will feel like
expressing it or doing it.

1056
01:19:50,022 --> 01:19:51,069
Damn you!

1057
01:19:51,177 --> 01:19:53,474
-Shruthi...
-She will understand you later.

1058
01:19:53,499 --> 01:19:56,674
Ratnam is making a scene.
Let's go manage him.

1059
01:19:57,930 --> 01:20:00,883
-Go talk to him.
-I feel very tensed!

1060
01:20:01,518 --> 01:20:04,064
-Sir, that's...
-Just shut the hell up!

1061
01:20:04,089 --> 01:20:06,456
-Get out!
-Sir, please calm down, sir.

1062
01:20:07,675 --> 01:20:09,487
Oh my holy angels!

1063
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:13,230
-Sir...
-Why did you do that, bro?

1064
01:20:13,409 --> 01:20:16,503
Even I have no idea why I did so, sir.

1065
01:20:16,708 --> 01:20:20,739
Reading the script,
I thought it's me who cheated on her.

1066
01:20:21,779 --> 01:20:22,998
True, bro!

1067
01:20:23,630 --> 01:20:26,114
Actually, I have nothing to do with her.

1068
01:20:26,818 --> 01:20:29,638
But for all the feelings
that got created inside me...

1069
01:20:29,888 --> 01:20:31,794
Your script is the reason behind it, bro.

1070
01:20:33,307 --> 01:20:35,190
-You fool!
-Sir sir sir...

1071
01:20:35,727 --> 01:20:37,906
-He's right, sir?
-What the hell!

1072
01:20:37,931 --> 01:20:41,792
If they have nothing to do with each
other, why did she hug him and cry?

1073
01:20:42,049 --> 01:20:43,674
I asked her the same, sir.

1074
01:20:43,801 --> 01:20:48,574
She said she thought we had secret
cameras installed and she went with it.

1075
01:20:48,907 --> 01:20:53,157
Of course, she's the greatest
actress ever, Savitri, right?

1076
01:20:53,378 --> 01:20:56,675
And he's Mahesh Babu to jump
into the character and act!

1077
01:20:57,030 --> 01:21:00,179
Whatever happened had happened...
Let's start the shoot, sir.

1078
01:21:00,204 --> 01:21:02,514
No way I will do that.

1079
01:21:02,577 --> 01:21:06,054
What if he stays in the character
and kills someone? Oh, God!

1080
01:21:06,079 --> 01:21:08,427
Oh my holy angels!

1081
01:21:09,061 --> 01:21:11,819
Raghu, go get him tested right away.

1082
01:21:11,963 --> 01:21:14,276
Sir, which hospital
should I take him to, sir?

1083
01:21:14,685 --> 01:21:16,927
Take him to Dr. Samaram.

1084
01:21:16,998 --> 01:21:18,655
Best place! Get lost!

1085
01:21:18,772 --> 01:21:20,241
-God!
-Leave!

1086
01:21:20,405 --> 01:21:22,343
You keep exploiting the producers!

1087
01:21:24,337 --> 01:21:25,634
Sir, cool, sir!

1088
01:21:32,562 --> 01:21:34,312
-What might have happened!
-Here he is.

1089
01:21:34,337 --> 01:21:35,734
What happened?

1090
01:21:36,493 --> 01:21:38,524
Suggested rest for 15 days.

1091
01:21:39,428 --> 01:21:41,623
-Thank you, Shruthi.
-For what?

1092
01:21:42,449 --> 01:21:43,988
For understanding me.

1093
01:21:44,013 --> 01:21:46,869
You have to thank me.
I made her understand.

1094
01:21:46,904 --> 01:21:51,044
No matter what we say... The one who
understands are the great people.

1095
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:53,328
And if a girl understands you...

1096
01:21:53,353 --> 01:21:55,559
It means the end of the world
is postponed by 100 years.

1097
01:21:55,584 --> 01:21:59,144
Sir Krishna, trying to praise women,
you are looking down on best friends.

1098
01:21:59,249 --> 01:22:00,796
Remember that!

1099
01:22:01,086 --> 01:22:05,032
-[phone rings]
-Ratnam! Sir sir sir...

1100
01:22:05,883 --> 01:22:08,844
Sir? You are here! Coming, sir.

1101
01:22:13,351 --> 01:22:14,874
What brings you here, sir?

1102
01:22:15,104 --> 01:22:17,588
Did you come to see us?
You love us, sir! I know.

1103
01:22:17,613 --> 01:22:20,660
Enough of what he did.
You don't build on it.

1104
01:22:20,965 --> 01:22:23,067
Shut the hell up and tell
me what the doctor said.

1105
01:22:23,092 --> 01:22:25,682
-Oh my holy angels.
-Sir sir sir...

1106
01:22:25,707 --> 01:22:28,870
Gave medication for 15 days.
Resting at home will do, sir.

1107
01:22:29,535 --> 01:22:32,965
Nothing like that, sir. Just a small
disturbance. I have no problems.

1108
01:22:32,990 --> 01:22:35,214
Your problem is that
you think you have none.

1109
01:22:35,239 --> 01:22:36,473
-Surya...
-Sir?

1110
01:22:36,498 --> 01:22:39,055
As we promised him,
let's wait for 15 more days.

1111
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:41,874
If he's still in the problem,
let's search for a solution.

1112
01:22:41,899 --> 01:22:43,037
-Ok, sir.
-Look...

1113
01:22:43,563 --> 01:22:45,532
This is my first and
last warning to you two.

1114
01:22:45,557 --> 01:22:48,139
We'll go for shoot after 15 days.
Take care!

1115
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:50,862
-Take care, sir.
-Stop over-acting!

1116
01:22:50,887 --> 01:22:53,168
-I'll teach you...
-Just 15 days!

1117
01:22:53,193 --> 01:22:55,535
-Get in.
-God!

1118
01:22:56,357 --> 01:22:57,575
Sir.

1119
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:00,266
Bye, sir.

1120
01:23:01,096 --> 01:23:04,104
What will your mom think if
you take me home so suddenly?

1121
01:23:04,129 --> 01:23:07,709
Nothing! She knows everything about
you, except how you look.

1122
01:23:08,969 --> 01:23:11,243
I'm used to tell mom everything, Krishna.

1123
01:23:14,647 --> 01:23:17,507
Don't feel bad, I told her that
you are a hero. Don't worry.

â™ªI feel your love.â™ª

â™ªLet's take over time together.â™ª

â™ªThis is a new life for me...
And I want to spend it with you.â™ª

â™ªOur movements started
sounding like a song.â™ª

â™ªThey took a new birth because of you.â™ª

â™ªHappiness had become my relative.â™ª

1142

â™ªI'll give myself to

1143
01:25:03,035 --> 01:25:07,950
â™ªI cease to exist without you.â™ª

â™ªMy eyes took reat and

â™ªSee for yourself...â™ª

[indistinct chatter]

1151
01:26:03,940 --> 01:26:05,706
-Sir...
-Stop it!

1152
01:26:06,451 --> 01:26:08,889
What? See where Rihana is.

1153
01:26:08,914 --> 01:26:12,232
-Ok, sir.
-Bloody side income stealers!

1154
01:26:12,257 --> 01:26:14,537
-Ok, sir.
-Go call her!

1155
01:26:15,112 --> 01:26:17,222
-Where is Krishna.
-Reading script in the room, sir.

1156
01:26:17,303 --> 01:26:18,623
Ask him to read out in the open.

1157
01:26:18,999 --> 01:26:22,202
Or else, he'll repeat the same mess!

1158
01:26:22,227 --> 01:26:23,610
There's no doors to his room, sir.

1159
01:26:23,635 --> 01:26:25,550
-What?
-Can't reach her phone, sir.

1160
01:26:25,575 --> 01:26:27,934
Go try again.
Don't you know at least that?

1161
01:26:27,959 --> 01:26:30,555
-Director...
-Yeah, sir?

1162
01:26:30,770 --> 01:26:32,817
-Director... Come here.
-Coming, sir.

1163
01:26:33,539 --> 01:26:34,899
-Sir...
-Tell me, sir.

1164
01:26:34,924 --> 01:26:36,841
Did you tell her that today is the shoot?

1165
01:26:36,866 --> 01:26:40,122
Yes, sir. She missed her flight yesterday.
So she started this morning.

1166
01:26:40,892 --> 01:26:42,595
Today she'll say that
the pilot got Corona.

1167
01:26:42,620 --> 01:26:44,750
I'll stop the shoot if
anything goes wrong.

1168
01:26:44,775 --> 01:26:47,510
Sir, don't say that.
This time I'll take care of everything.

1169
01:26:47,745 --> 01:26:51,003
Breaking news!
Actress Rihana Das passed away.

1170
01:26:51,028 --> 01:26:55,124
Her car met with an accident
on the airport highway.

1171
01:26:55,149 --> 01:26:56,543
And she died on spot.

1172
01:26:56,568 --> 01:27:01,288
But there are a lot of speculation
around her death right now.

1173
01:27:10,611 --> 01:27:13,486
-We don't have a police character!
-Shut up!

1174
01:27:15,173 --> 01:27:18,235
Rihana died. So stop acting.

1175
01:27:18,352 --> 01:27:20,751
-Let's go.
-Why are the police here for you?

1176
01:27:21,535 --> 01:27:23,597
You have something to
do with Rihana's death!

1177
01:27:23,622 --> 01:27:25,511
Krishna, what's this? What's happening?

1178
01:27:25,695 --> 01:27:28,351
-Why did the police some for you?
-Are you even an actor?

1179
01:27:28,376 --> 01:27:30,079
-No, sir.
-[all]: No?

1180
01:27:30,104 --> 01:27:31,602
Silence!

1181
01:27:32,590 --> 01:27:34,481
He's my brother's son.

1182
01:27:34,648 --> 01:27:38,257
I asked him to take part in
a murder case inquiry...

1183
01:27:38,684 --> 01:27:40,403
So he travelled with you all these days.

1184
01:27:40,428 --> 01:27:42,145
-God!
-Murder?

1185
01:27:42,731 --> 01:27:44,629
-Who's murder?
-Journalist Geetha.

1186
01:27:50,339 --> 01:27:53,354
Then I'll forward this
case to one town SI Kumar.

1187
01:27:53,627 --> 01:27:56,557
So, you can take rest.
And, you may leave.

1188
01:27:58,526 --> 01:28:00,222
[thunder claps]

1189
01:28:06,718 --> 01:28:08,359
-Sir...
-Yes, Rajiv?

1190
01:28:08,645 --> 01:28:11,192
-I will handle this case, sir.
-No.

1191
01:28:11,540 --> 01:28:13,493
Not in this position. No!

1192
01:28:13,518 --> 01:28:17,534
My bullet wound is nothing
compared to her death, sir.

1193
01:28:17,559 --> 01:28:20,041
You can transfer this case
to someone else, but...

1194
01:28:20,217 --> 01:28:22,412
The kind of pain I saw in her eyes...

1195
01:28:23,189 --> 01:28:25,048
Who can you transfer that to, sir?

1196
01:28:25,289 --> 01:28:27,726
Sir, from now on... This is my case.

1197
01:28:28,585 --> 01:28:32,303
Seriously and sincerely...
I will trace this mystery, sir.

1198
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:34,847
-Sir, please, sir.
-Ok, Rajiv.

1199
01:28:35,168 --> 01:28:37,043
You may go ahead. But...

1200
01:28:37,390 --> 01:28:40,593
-Take care of yourself.
-Sir! Thank you, sir!

1201
01:28:56,268 --> 01:28:59,800
You are taking that girl's
case too personally.

1202
01:29:01,306 --> 01:29:02,955
Not personally...

1203
01:29:03,266 --> 01:29:05,743
I'm thinking as a responsible person.

1204
01:29:06,037 --> 01:29:07,506
You haven't changed at all.

1205
01:29:09,998 --> 01:29:13,272
He would have helped you if
he had got this job, right?

1206
01:29:15,387 --> 01:29:16,481
Bye!

1207
01:29:22,421 --> 01:29:25,772
I didn't do anything wrong, uncle.
Go enquire in the station if you want to.

1208
01:29:27,121 --> 01:29:29,957
Without your mistake
how will an FIR be filed?

1209
01:29:29,982 --> 01:29:31,905
I hit them as they did a mistake.

1210
01:29:32,096 --> 01:29:35,049
It's you who thought me not to
let a mistake go unaddressed.

1211
01:29:35,075 --> 01:29:38,107
Of course, I did. But that doesn't mean
to fight like goons on the roads.

1212
01:29:38,946 --> 01:29:41,922
See what happened!
He got selected in all the rounds.

1213
01:29:42,232 --> 01:29:44,599
He would have become
an SI within one week.

1214
01:29:45,166 --> 01:29:48,244
A policeman doesn't want anger...
He needs patience.

1215
01:29:48,976 --> 01:29:51,422
One signature from you
will make it right...

1216
01:29:51,447 --> 01:29:55,031
Not just the one who signs, the one who
gets it should also be worthy of it.

1217
01:30:07,067 --> 01:30:07,084
Shall we make a move, uncle?

1218
01:30:07,084 --> 01:30:08,270
Shall we make a move, uncle?
Let's go uncle
Shall we make a move, uncle?

1219
01:30:08,270 --> 01:30:08,332
Shall we make a move, uncle?

1220
01:30:13,060 --> 01:30:14,554
-Hello sir.
-Yesh, sit.

1221
01:30:16,653 --> 01:30:17,342
Tell me

1222
01:30:17,542 --> 01:30:20,840
Your file holds only the questions, sir.
But I have their answers.

1223
01:30:21,164 --> 01:30:22,251
What?

1224
01:30:22,691 --> 01:30:23,842
Check this file once.

1225
01:30:24,094 --> 01:30:25,133
What are you referring to?

1226
01:30:25,368 --> 01:30:26,518
About Geetha's murder, sir.

1227
01:30:27,096 --> 01:30:28,990
Geetha is not a model as you think, sir.

1228
01:30:29,428 --> 01:30:31,933
She's an intern journalist
working on women trafficking.

1229
01:30:33,205 --> 01:30:34,654
We warned her it's risky
but she'd never listen.

1230
01:30:34,915 --> 01:30:36,204
-Who is she?
-Rihana Das.

1231
01:30:36,404 --> 01:30:39,194
She was a model with a company
'Viswamitra' a few months ago.

1232
01:30:40,045 --> 01:30:42,820
The company became popular
after her entry.

1233
01:30:43,114 --> 01:30:44,121
Women escorting...

1234
01:30:44,330 --> 01:30:48,532
We got information that model agencies in
Hyderabad and Vizag are indulging in it.

1235
01:30:48,838 --> 01:30:50,461
VM is among those.

1236
01:30:50,695 --> 01:30:53,930
So, Geetha joined with them
and started her enquiry.

1237
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:57,610
But, she didn't unveil
who the main person is.

1238
01:30:58,068 --> 01:31:00,210
Isn't she Geetha's sister?

1239
01:31:00,569 --> 01:31:01,595
Yes sir.

1240
01:31:02,020 --> 01:31:03,843
Even her family doesn't know the truth,

1241
01:31:04,104 --> 01:31:07,894
as they were disturbed
by the rumours on her death.

1242
01:31:08,133 --> 01:31:09,782
They're not willing to speak with anyone.

1243
01:31:10,042 --> 01:31:12,322
The entire information we
have is in this file sir.

1244
01:31:12,522 --> 01:31:14,160
You can contact me for any help

1245
01:31:15,850 --> 01:31:16,976
She's Geetha.

1246
01:31:17,176 --> 01:31:22,259
As per our previous conversation,
she's an intern journalist

1247
01:31:22,580 --> 01:31:24,360
As per Journalist rajesh,

1248
01:31:24,681 --> 01:31:29,064
VM Company was closed within a short
time after Geetha joined.

1249
01:31:29,264 --> 01:31:33,764
So Geetha continued her investigation
while modelling for another company.

1250
01:31:34,158 --> 01:31:39,080
These are the popular modelling agencies
in Bangalore, Hyderabad and Vizag.

1251
01:31:39,540 --> 01:31:43,280
Geetha collected important evidence
while working here.

1252
01:31:44,363 --> 01:31:45,426
Let's watch this.

1253
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:47,985
After Drugs and Arts trafficking...

1254
01:31:48,235 --> 01:31:50,232
human trafficking is in 3rd place

1255
01:31:50,935 --> 01:31:52,509
Women trafficking is a art of it.

1256
01:31:52,769 --> 01:31:55,893
They have different styles in doing this.

1257
01:31:56,179 --> 01:31:58,618
Some kidnap kids and sell them
where there is a demand.

1258
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:01,519
or they harvest their
organs and sell them.

1259
01:32:01,719 --> 01:32:05,113
As they are kids,
dealers faced no resistance from them.

1260
01:32:05,383 --> 01:32:08,221
They manage the activity
through local groups.

1261
01:32:08,421 --> 01:32:11,832
All of this aside, there are some groups
that follow a different agenda.

1262
01:32:12,157 --> 01:32:14,306
Their target is young girls.

1263
01:32:15,062 --> 01:32:17,540
Girls who can't control
their bodily needs...

1264
01:32:18,285 --> 01:32:22,270
girls who face financial
crunch and loneliness...

1265
01:32:22,638 --> 01:32:27,320
and the ones who want to build their
career in a short time are their target

1266
01:32:28,471 --> 01:32:31,396
The tasks of this group look legal.

1267
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:33,371
That adds up to their strength.

1268
01:32:33,819 --> 01:32:36,410
Hence, some girls get attracted to them.

1269
01:32:37,464 --> 01:32:39,246
Their companies are corporate...

1270
01:32:39,467 --> 01:32:42,979
Modelling agencies, film castings,
air hostess training,

1271
01:32:43,244 --> 01:32:47,523
Training centers, corporate training
centers, overseas employment agencies...

1272
01:32:47,867 --> 01:32:51,295
Such high class looking facilities...

1273
01:32:51,550 --> 01:32:54,141
But their final target
is supplying girls abroad.

1274
01:32:54,857 --> 01:32:56,949
After they get to know
the truth after joining

1275
01:32:57,199 --> 01:33:01,566
they create a bottle neck situation
and blackmail the girls and trap them.

1276
01:33:02,028 --> 01:33:04,340
They will kill anyone who rebels.

1277
01:33:04,783 --> 01:33:09,105
I've got to know the main person behind
this even after knowing so many secrets.

1278
01:33:09,681 --> 01:33:15,160
They silently started women
trafficking by all these methods,

1279
01:33:15,533 --> 01:33:19,970
With this information we have
to catch the killer.

1280
01:33:23,162 --> 01:33:26,629
If you want to be on duty
only after becoming a cop,

1281
01:33:26,877 --> 01:33:29,891
you can forget whatever you've
heard now and go home happily.

1282
01:33:30,315 --> 01:33:32,140
Becoming a cop is my life ambition, Uncle.

1283
01:33:32,466 --> 01:33:34,118
but, your word is more than that.

1284
01:33:34,451 --> 01:33:36,358
I'll report back with the
remaining information sir.

1285
01:33:37,764 --> 01:33:41,520
I started handling this case with the
limited information my Uncle gave me.

1286
01:33:52,659 --> 01:33:56,300
[music mutes voices]

1287
01:33:56,508 --> 01:33:59,710
And journalist Rajesh, gave me
the hope to solve this case.

1288
01:34:00,144 --> 01:34:01,161
[mobile phone rings]

1289
01:34:25,173 --> 01:34:28,760
Geetha collected some important
evidences risking her life.

1290
01:34:29,301 --> 01:34:32,690
Unfortunately,
she was murdered in the same process.

1291
01:34:34,635 --> 01:34:36,800
[thunders rumbling]

1292
01:34:49,199 --> 01:34:50,650
[glasses breaking]

1293
01:36:14,208 --> 01:36:15,490
The mystery is still the same.

1294
01:36:15,881 --> 01:36:18,510
But I'll definitely trace it.

1295
01:36:19,084 --> 01:36:21,124
'Geetha is not a model as you think, sir.

1296
01:36:21,328 --> 01:36:23,934
She's an intern journalist
working on women trafficking.'

1297
01:36:24,477 --> 01:36:26,133
'As per journalist Rajesh,

1298
01:36:26,457 --> 01:36:30,845
VM Company was closed within a
short time after Geetha joined.'

1299
01:36:31,138 --> 01:36:35,660
'I've got to know the main person behind
this even after knowing so many secrets.'

1300
01:36:37,624 --> 01:36:41,130
Uncle, as per my information,
Rihana returned back.

1301
01:36:41,999 --> 01:36:43,920
Moreover, to Hyderabad

1302
01:36:45,050 --> 01:36:48,701
Didn't you say your friend works
as a manager in movies?

1303
01:36:48,930 --> 01:36:50,340
-What's his name?
-Its Raghu, sir.

1304
01:36:50,572 --> 01:36:55,830
Join him as his roommate,
without saying the word Police.

1305
01:36:56,203 --> 01:36:57,480
We'll take care of the rest.

1306
01:36:59,522 --> 01:37:01,907
So I was the one who was
fooled and used by you?

1307
01:37:02,862 --> 01:37:04,520
To hell with this disussion!

1308
01:37:06,448 --> 01:37:08,540
Are you acting as a lead
in my film or not?

1309
01:37:11,141 --> 01:37:12,470
This is my past Surya.

1310
01:37:12,670 --> 01:37:15,292
People are talking crazy things
without knowing the truth.

1311
01:37:15,885 --> 01:37:18,720
You have to prove them
rumors using the film.

1312
01:37:19,493 --> 01:37:20,265
Sir,

1313
01:37:20,815 --> 01:37:24,770
Rihana portayed herself as a good
human being in her fake story.

1314
01:37:25,877 --> 01:37:28,950
She's one of the partners in
this women trafficking, sir.

1315
01:37:29,804 --> 01:37:34,070
She also wanted to change the
evidence through Surya's movie.

1316
01:37:34,933 --> 01:37:36,160
That's why she faked a story.

1317
01:37:37,465 --> 01:37:38,644
The first lie in the story...

1318
01:37:38,911 --> 01:37:41,178
She said she met Rahul
and Rihana got closer in a pub.

1319
01:37:41,399 --> 01:37:43,518
But she didn't say she knew Bobby earlier.

1320
01:37:43,761 --> 01:37:45,199
-Love?
-No lust!

1321
01:37:45,654 --> 01:37:46,913
I'm super attracted to him.

1322
01:37:48,264 --> 01:37:50,940
Do whatever you want to,
I wouldn't stop your enjoyment.

1323
01:37:51,149 --> 01:37:54,350
But just remember,
he should not know about us.

1324
01:37:54,712 --> 01:37:56,090
-OK?
-Yes.

1325
01:37:56,743 --> 01:38:00,200
Rihana and Bobby didn't know
that Geetha was observing them.

1326
01:38:01,097 --> 01:38:03,943
As per our plan,
we grew closer to Geetha's family

1327
01:38:04,159 --> 01:38:06,662
and got hold of the evidences
in her personal laptop.

1328
01:38:07,355 --> 01:38:09,160
Rihana lied yet another time.

1329
01:38:10,102 --> 01:38:12,092
She said, when she sent her nudes to Rahul

1330
01:38:12,319 --> 01:38:16,012
and filed a case with the cops
that Bobby was along with Rahul.

1331
01:38:17,157 --> 01:38:22,009
But the truth was Bobby wasn't along
with Rahul, but he was with Rihana.

1332
01:38:23,793 --> 01:38:27,906
Sir, as per Rihana's complaint,
accoding to the time she specidied...

1333
01:38:28,314 --> 01:38:29,691
we traced the call data.

1334
01:38:29,914 --> 01:38:31,420
It showed Rahul was at one location

1335
01:38:31,911 --> 01:38:35,530
and Rihana and Bobby were
together at another place.

1336
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:39,200
There's another blunder
in the story she narrated.

1337
01:38:40,007 --> 01:38:43,490
She said Rahul left before her nudes
were presented on the stage.

1338
01:38:43,728 --> 01:38:44,759
But,

1339
01:38:45,212 --> 01:38:46,801
In the pics Geetha clicked,

1340
01:38:47,065 --> 01:38:51,805
we can see evidence that Rahul followed
a crying Rihana who left form the place.

1341
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:57,990
After Rihana filed a complaint on them,

1342
01:38:58,545 --> 01:39:01,480
the police enquiry found
that Bobby's dead in an accident.

1343
01:39:02,005 --> 01:39:03,410
Then what about Rahul?

1344
01:39:03,630 --> 01:39:04,708
He's Dead sir.

1345
01:39:05,690 --> 01:39:06,824
-What?
-Yes, sir.

1346
01:39:07,521 --> 01:39:10,190
Rahul is dead,not bobby

1347
01:39:10,699 --> 01:39:12,139
It's a pre-planned murder.

1348
01:39:12,339 --> 01:39:13,991
Bobby already was in escorting cases.

1349
01:39:14,228 --> 01:39:16,386
And Rihana was his secret
partner in eveyrthing.

1350
01:39:17,536 --> 01:39:19,456
As all of these secrets unfolded,

1351
01:39:19,712 --> 01:39:23,207
they killed Rahul and projected
as if it was Bobby who was killed

1352
01:39:24,390 --> 01:39:25,620
Whoa!

1353
01:39:25,862 --> 01:39:27,900
Then what happened to Rihana's Case?

1354
01:39:28,369 --> 01:39:29,400
It's a false case sir!

1355
01:39:30,011 --> 01:39:32,950
They have put up this case
to avoid any doubts on them.

1356
01:39:33,366 --> 01:39:34,366
[sighs heavily]

1357
01:39:34,746 --> 01:39:38,380
It's clear sir. Rihana and Bobby
purposefully revealed her nudes.

1358
01:39:38,763 --> 01:39:43,310
and filed a case saying that
Rahul and Bobby planned this.

1359
01:39:44,430 --> 01:39:47,660
As its recorded officially
that Bobby is dead,

1360
01:39:48,022 --> 01:39:52,230
they closed all the VM Companies on his
father's name according to the plan.

1361
01:39:54,421 --> 01:39:57,190
Thinking that everything was cleaned
after Geetha's murder,

1362
01:39:58,174 --> 01:40:00,290
Rihana made a comeback.

1363
01:40:00,625 --> 01:40:04,586
Then, do we have any
proof that Bobby is alive?

1364
01:40:05,287 --> 01:40:06,360
We do, sir.

1365
01:40:10,029 --> 01:40:14,820
The tattoo on Bobby's
dead body is temporary.

1366
01:40:17,118 --> 01:40:22,026
They tattooed Rahul's body after killing
him, to prove it's Bobby's body.

1367
01:40:22,269 --> 01:40:23,971
That is their biggest mistake.

1368
01:40:25,037 --> 01:40:28,530
As they committed the crime together,
if my guess is right...

1369
01:40:29,108 --> 01:40:31,400
Rihana is still in contact with Bobby.

1370
01:40:31,909 --> 01:40:33,630
But,
we don't have no evidence to prove that.

1371
01:40:34,997 --> 01:40:36,653
Are you all mad?

1372
01:40:37,024 --> 01:40:38,357
Is that a Micheal Jackson tattoo?

1373
01:40:38,563 --> 01:40:41,470
That tattoo is also on the arm of
Rihana's Make up man, that moron.

1374
01:40:41,670 --> 01:40:42,790
Silence

1375
01:40:42,990 --> 01:40:43,990
Sorry, sir.

1376
01:40:57,710 --> 01:40:58,840
We got Bobby sir.

1377
01:41:15,716 --> 01:41:17,030
He is definitely in Hyderabad sir.

1378
01:41:18,758 --> 01:41:20,020
Thanks, Mr. Director

1379
01:41:20,323 --> 01:41:21,139
How?

1380
01:41:30,462 --> 01:41:32,380
Are you done with your
social service? Let's go now.

1381
01:41:32,752 --> 01:41:37,640
Saving girls isn't social service.
Killing people like you is.

1382
01:41:39,986 --> 01:41:40,985
Is it love?

1383
01:41:59,081 --> 01:41:59,894
[screams]

1384
01:42:01,345 --> 01:42:02,800
[shot fired]

1385
01:42:05,142 --> 01:42:06,192
Uncle, shall we go?

1386
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,170
Sir the case will be solved
in the next hour.

1387
01:42:10,473 --> 01:42:11,874
-Go ahead
-Thank you, sir.

1388
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:15,206
[screen blipping]

1389
01:42:15,406 --> 01:42:16,727
Is the location traced? Sit! Sit!

1390
01:42:17,053 --> 01:42:18,265
-It's being traced sir.
-OK.

1391
01:42:18,465 --> 01:42:19,950
Go to that monitor.

1392
01:42:20,153 --> 01:42:21,940
This is her last location, sir.

1393
01:42:22,535 --> 01:42:23,540
Can you zoom in?

1394
01:42:25,539 --> 01:42:26,568
[screen blipping]

1395
01:42:26,828 --> 01:42:27,829
Zoom... zoom in.

1397
01:42:29,308 --> 01:42:31,590
Hey... to your left, not right.

-[screen blipping]
-Zoom in!

1399
01:42:35,299 --> 01:42:36,427
-There.
-Yep!

1400
01:42:36,792 --> 01:42:37,988
-That's it?
-It is.

1401
01:42:38,518 --> 01:42:39,754
Got it man! OK, fine.

1402
01:42:41,898 --> 01:42:43,187
Keep it with you, careful.

1403
01:42:43,717 --> 01:42:45,035
-Very careful!
-I'll handle it.

1404
01:42:45,563 --> 01:42:46,590
Let's go.

1405
01:42:57,727 --> 01:43:02,560
"Lord Vishnu became Rama
and lead Ramayana"

1406
01:43:03,048 --> 01:43:07,900
"Lord Krishna showed a way to the world"

1407
01:43:08,522 --> 01:43:13,040
"Thought of all the tasks in his thoughts"

1408
01:43:13,902 --> 01:43:18,380
"Stood along with destiny and memory"

1409
01:43:19,260 --> 01:43:21,189
"World didn't find the shadow"

1410
01:43:21,563 --> 01:43:24,120
"in the shades of dark"
-Bobby

1411
01:43:24,636 --> 01:43:29,450
"Our fate which is of
small lines is not visible"

1412
01:43:29,854 --> 01:43:32,570
-"If your ego is along with you"
-What happened?

1413
01:43:32,785 --> 01:43:33,910
Suicide attempt, Sir.

1414
01:43:35,097 --> 01:43:39,545
"A word is the life of
unforgettable stories, my brother"

1415

"Characters in this story are fictitious"

1416
01:43:47,906 --> 01:43:50,920
"Characters in this story are fictitious"

1417
01:43:56,498 --> 01:43:59,100
"Characters in this story are fictitious"

1418
01:44:01,620 --> 01:44:04,520
"Characters in this story are fictitious"

1419
01:44:07,020 --> 01:44:09,760
"Characters in this story are fictitious"

1420
01:44:12,382 --> 01:44:15,230
"Characters in this story are fictitious"

1421
01:44:17,841 --> 01:44:20,310
"Characters in this story are fictitious"

1422
01:44:22,192 --> 01:44:24,790
[leaves rustling]

1423
01:44:29,404 --> 01:44:31,591
Oh come on Jerry!

1424
01:44:31,938 --> 01:44:33,690
-[cartoon playing]
-Come on damn it!

1425
01:44:39,487 --> 01:44:40,519
Hey, hi!

1426
01:44:41,248 --> 01:44:42,250
This is Bobby.

1427
01:44:53,631 --> 01:44:54,820
Oh no!

1428
01:44:56,648 --> 01:44:57,648
Sorry bro!

1429
01:44:58,496 --> 01:45:01,090
Our people hit you hard
without knowing you are a hero!

1430
01:45:02,398 --> 01:45:04,420
Are you hurt? Did they hit you hard?

1431
01:45:09,130 --> 01:45:11,591
What a program, bro! What a program!

1432
01:45:12,025 --> 01:45:16,807
Watch! It's a program
that the kids watch...

1433
01:45:17,295 --> 01:45:20,443
But, bro... This is the
most psychotic program ever!

1434
01:45:21,799 --> 01:45:24,580
Tom and Jerry...
both are psychotic fellows.

1435
01:45:24,605 --> 01:45:28,133
Selfish... Game of deception!

1436
01:45:29,272 --> 01:45:31,460
Right? Right?

1437
01:45:32,305 --> 01:45:34,133
Right? Right?

1438
01:45:48,830 --> 01:45:53,025
Hey, even a person with an identity
can't live in this cunning society.

1439
01:45:53,102 --> 01:45:56,805
And me? I'm living by hiding this
face from the last two years.

1440
01:45:57,132 --> 01:45:58,741
Do you know how difficult that is?

1441
01:45:59,625 --> 01:46:03,141
What wrong did I do?
Huh? Killing Geetha?

1442
01:46:03,493 --> 01:46:05,220
Or killing Rahul and Rihana?

1443
01:46:05,969 --> 01:46:09,094
Ok, I'll agree that I did
some really bad sins!

1444
01:46:09,282 --> 01:46:12,813
The God will take care of me.
Why does the police get involved?

1445
01:46:17,162 --> 01:46:21,147
It's ok. As everyone came to know
about it, I killed Rahul with a plan.

1446
01:46:21,761 --> 01:46:24,823
I planned my own murder
and created my own death.

1447
01:46:24,848 --> 01:46:28,499
And I'm doing my business in silence.

1448
01:46:28,682 --> 01:46:31,307
Geetha played really clever.
But it didn't work.

1449
01:46:32,024 --> 01:46:34,118
I played with a gun and it worked.

1450
01:46:34,182 --> 01:46:36,627
Ok, I did a mistake and I agree.

1451
01:46:36,652 --> 01:46:38,855
The God will take care of me, right?

1452
01:46:39,330 --> 01:46:41,479
Why do you care?

1453
01:46:44,670 --> 01:46:48,928
You told Rihana that she's the
heroine and used her to trap me.

1454
01:46:49,594 --> 01:46:53,563
And she planned to expose
me for her publicity.

1455
01:46:56,468 --> 01:46:58,069
Tom & Jerry!

1456
01:46:58,686 --> 01:47:01,592
Game of deception.
And I'm a die-hard fan of that show.

1457
01:47:01,801 --> 01:47:04,981
How did you even think of deceiving me?
How how how?

1458
01:47:09,832 --> 01:47:13,097
All these days,
I thought God will take care of me.

1459
01:47:13,122 --> 01:47:15,413
He won't do that...
And you guys won't stop!

1460
01:47:15,462 --> 01:47:17,634
So what did you learn from this?

1461
01:47:17,953 --> 01:47:21,070
There is no God. No! That's why...

1462
01:47:21,736 --> 01:47:24,252
One has to kill his own enemy!

1463
01:47:24,524 --> 01:47:26,946
One has to fight his own war.

1464
01:49:25,739 --> 01:49:27,043
Sorry, uncle...

1465
01:49:27,620 --> 01:49:30,784
I wasted a bullet from
the gun you gave me.

1466
01:49:40,632 --> 01:49:42,304
We have to fight our own war.

1467
01:49:42,329 --> 01:49:45,491
But if you think of every
bad deed you did as war...

1468
01:49:45,516 --> 01:49:48,304
You don't lose. You simply die!

1469
01:49:55,255 --> 01:49:57,880
-Done jogging?
-Yeah.

1470
01:49:58,020 --> 01:49:59,223
Ok.

1471
01:50:00,143 --> 01:50:03,347
You got 2 - 3 calls from the SP's office.

1472
01:50:09,260 --> 01:50:11,682
-Do you have to go on Sunday too?
-Yeah, I have to.

1473
01:50:11,707 --> 01:50:13,539
-[phone rings]
-You are getting a call.

1474
01:50:16,274 --> 01:50:17,516
Yeah, uncle...

1475
01:50:43,883 --> 01:50:47,616
ALL THE CHARACTERS IN
THIS STORY ARE FICTITIOUS!

1476
01:50:47,900 --> 01:50:51,976
