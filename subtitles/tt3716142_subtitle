1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500


3
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:39,333
Are you done taking pictures?

4
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:40,500
Now do some work.

5
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,500
Get the platters from upstairs. - Okay.

6
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:54,708
Karishma, get the dry-fruits as well. - Okay.

7
00:02:55,208 --> 00:03:01,541
If you scream, you'll be the most terrible person I know.

8
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:05,541
Hello, Princess. - Awesome, Dino.

9
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:14,791
Shall we run? - Of course.

10
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:18,791
Come.

11
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:24,291
Come.

12
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:30,666
"K...Khalifa."

13
00:03:57,458 --> 00:04:01,208
"Khalifa. Khalifa. Khalifa."

14
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,916
"We are unfortunates."

15
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:09,208
"Khalifa. Khalifa. Khalifa."

16
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:13,041
"We're marching ahead."

17
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:17,416
"Every moment's filled with risks."

18
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:21,166
"That's all we crave for."

19
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:25,375
"The ambiance changes to our attitude."

20
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:28,833
"This is different persona.."

21
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:33,208
"Khalifa. Khalifa. Khalifa."

22
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:36,916
"We are unfortunates."

23
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:40,916
"Khalifa. Khalifa. Khalifa we're.."

24
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:05,208
"We squeezed the sky.."

25
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,750
"And drank the blue sherbet."

26
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,916
"We took a piece of sun and.."

27
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:24,833
"..a piece of cloud, held it in our fingers and chewed it."

28
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:29,041
"Khalifa. Khalifa. Khalifa."

29
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:32,958
"We are unfortunates."

30
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:37,208
"Khalifa. Khalifa. Khalifa."

31
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:41,125
"We're marching ahead."

32
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:45,500
"Every moment's filled with risks."

33
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,125
"That's all we crave for."

34
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:53,333
"The ambiance changes to our attitude."

35
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:57,333
"This is a unique reputation.."

36
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:17,208
"Khalifa. Khalifa. Khalifa."

37
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,208
"We're marching ahead."

38
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,125
"We're marching ahead."

39
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:25,375
"Every moment's filled with risks."

40
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:29,208
"That's all we crave for."

41
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:33,208
"The ambiance changes to our attitude."

42
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:36,958
"This is a unique reputation.."

43
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:40,958
"Khalifa. Khalifa. Khalifa, we're.."

44
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,000
I told them that I won't go with them

45
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,875
because my ear starts paining in the airplane..

46
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,041
.. and I also feel nauseous.

47
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:56,875
Mom, please.

48
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,000
We went on a 21 days tour of Europe.

49
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,791
Take it. They are homemade.

50
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,166
Help yourself.

51
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:02,708
Mom loves to travel.

52
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:04,666
Hello, sir. - Come, Mahesh.

53
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:06,291
Would you like something?

54
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:09,583
Eat, son... help yourself ...don't be shy like a girl.

55
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,083
Karishma.

56
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,750
Come, dear.

57
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,916
Looking nice, right?

58
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:17,458
Eat it, son...don't be shy.

59
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:19,041
We have every freedom in the world..

60
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:20,958
..but still, marriage before 21.

61
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:22,666
I just don't understand our parents.

62
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:24,375
The grand Shetty tradition.

63
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:25,416
Seriously.

64
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,125
Come, come, come, food's here.

65
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:27,833
Here you go, sir.

66
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,500
Wow, Chhotu. - Thank you.

67
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,541
You took so long.

68
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:31,500
I thought you'll come tomorrow.

69
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,666
Dino.

70
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:33,583
I am not hungry.

71
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:35,166
Why? Because Karishma's doing the catwalk?

72
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:38,250
Hey, virus, there's nothing like that between us.

73
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,166
Let it be.

74
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,583
We know what's between Karishma and you..

75
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:42,666
..and so does the entire college.

76
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,375
But God knows when you two will realize this.

77
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,500
I've a big confusion.

78
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,500
Are they friends, lovers, time-pass or DMC.

79
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,833
'Dekho lekin chhuo Mat'.(Look, but don't touch)

80
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:52,958
Oh, God. Milind.

81
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,875
Firstly, Karishma and I won't have an affair..

82
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:57,500
..just because you say so. Okay?

83
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,750
And secondly, she's just buying some time..

84
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,625
..to calm her short-tempered father.

85
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,958
So chill.

86
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,416
Hey..

87
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:07,250
Disgusting..

88
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,625
He's hogging like an animal.

89
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,583
I swear..

90
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,500
How is business?

91
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,375
It's doing well.

92
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:18,708
Seema.

93
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,458
She loves dancing since she was a kid.

94
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:25,500
I've seen the place but it's a bit messy.

95
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,875
There's a school nearby, permit's going to be..

96
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:31,875
It will be done.

97
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,083
She's just like her daddy.

98
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:48,916
What about the license? - It will be done.

99
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:49,625
Here.

100
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:54,916
Yes. Karishma, serve everyone.

101
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:56,416
Let me know if there's a problem.

102
00:08:56,916 --> 00:09:01,750
You can eat all you like after the wedding ... son, talk to her.

103
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,791
Beautiful pair. We won't find a better pair even in the Subramaniam temple.

104
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:09,083
The boy isn't eating anything.

105
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,708
And for the Shetty's, gold pleated sari means a thing of pride.

106
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:12,791
Sexy!

107
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:14,833
You aren't..

108
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:16,125
You want water? That's okay.... He always does that while drinking water.

109
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:17,416
What's wrong with him?

110
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,333
Serve him some whiskey.

111
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:23,291
That's his problem. He doesn't booze.

112
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:26,791
So you love her? - Of course I do.

113
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,875
I mean...like a friend.

114
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:30,708
But I don't know..

115
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,958
Could be something else.

116
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,916
But how am I supposed to know.

117
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:38,000
We're cool with one another.

118
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,083
But love and all..

119
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,375
Why do you ask stupid questions?

120
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,500
Just quietly play the game. - Sorry.

121
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,500
Come on. - Don't get furious.

122
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:55,875
Dinesh!

123
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:57,416
Dinesh!

124
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:58,625
Dinesh, get up.

125
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,166
Get up, Dinesh. Get up.

126
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,458
Dinesh is dead, mom.

127
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,208
He was fed up of his cheap middle-class name..

128
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:06,416
..and committed suicide. - Shut up.

129
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:07,833
Dino's sleeping. Goodnight.

130
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:10,333
I'll slap you back to reality.

131
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:11,708
What's this?

132
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,833
What's this?

133
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:16,750
So you've decided to completely ruin yourself.

134
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,041
Dino, my headphones.

135
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:19,500
It was somewhere here.

136
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,833
Dev. - Yes.

137
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:21,875
Dev, look.

138
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:23,666
Look what I found in the balcony.

139
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,500
He's into this as well.

140
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,333
Hold on. Let me see.

141
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:31,250
Bro, cigarette? The cheap ones.

142
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,375
You should at least smoke something of your class.

143
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:37,458
Dev, you? - Mom, maybe I..

144
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:41,083
Mother India Returns, he's 25 years old.

145
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,291
He knows what's good for him.

146
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:46,041
MBA. Job with a multi-national.

147
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:47,583
Foreign travel.

148
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:51,416
And you're concerned about a cigarette in the balcony.

149
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:54,583
He's your obedient son.

150
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:55,916
Spare him this time.

151
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:57,416
He'll never smoke again at home.

152
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:01,416
Right, AP?

153
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,583
You dumba** - No one's going to rebuke you.

154
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:09,458
You'll get me killed someday.

155
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:10,166
Don't hit me.

156
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:11,666
I've a headache, please not today.

157
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,083
How can you have a headache?

158
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:14,625
You're made for giving others a headache, you fool.

159
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:15,625
Okay, okay.

160
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:19,625
Crazy.

161
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,041
Even the cleaning-crew will have a heart-attack..

162
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:24,500
..looking at this dump.

163
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,916
Nina.

164
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,708
Nina...what's this?

165
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,208
Is this a room or a dustbin?

166
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:32,541
What do you expect me to do?

167
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,416
He never listens to me.

168
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,250
What are you doing?

169
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,291
Brush your teeth first.

170
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,125
All the clothes are lying on the bed.

171
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:41,125
Where does he sleep?

172
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:42,333
In the closet.

173
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,375
Mr. Bholu, will you get the ketchup..

174
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:47,875
..or are you waiting for harvest season. - Yes, sir.

175
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,208
Okay, papa. - Leaving, son.

176
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:51,333
Okay. Have a great trip.

177
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:54,583
Wish you every success. - Thank you.

178
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:57,583
Call me as soon as you get there. - Don't worry.

179
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,333
Be careful. Okay.

180
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,416
Are you dropping him to the airport?

181
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,250
No, actually I am busy today.

182
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,916
Why? He doesn't have college today either.

183
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:06,875
Exactly, otherwise I would've dropped him.

184
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,125
Papa, it's okay.

185
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:12,500
It's getting late. I'll take a cab.

186
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,708
Yuck. What are you doing, man?

187
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:14,458
Bye, BA.

188
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:16,125
Disgusting.

189
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:17,250
Bye, mom. - Bye, son.

190
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,166
Bye, BA.

191
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,166
BA 'Bigdi Aulaad'.(Spoilt Son)

192
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:22,541
Dev's right about him.

193
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:24,375
He's no use to anyone.

194
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:25,708
Dev's fulfilling all his responsibilities..

195
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:26,916
..although he's busy.

196
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:27,916
And this boy..

197
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:28,708
All he does is sit around at home without anything..

198
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:32,708
Wait, wait, I'll drop you.

199
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,083
This two hour drive is better than..

200
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:42,875
..listening to that boring and..

201
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:44,500
..allegedly corrupt government servant.

202
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,791
Dino.

203
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,083
Look after mom and dad.

204
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:50,291
Don't trouble them too much.

205
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,750
You should be thinking about those hot girls..

206
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:53,875
..you'll find in Hong Kong.

207
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:54,958
Right.

208
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:56,791
The company sends me there on a pleasure trip.

209
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,291
I don't work.

210
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:01,000
Poor God.

211
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,166
He must be thinking "I made such beautiful girls.."

212
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,000
"..but he doesn't even take a look."

213
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,250
Reform yourself, bro.

214
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:11,916
Follow the path of God.

215
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,500
Yeah, what's up?

216
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
What the..

217
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,416
Operation Universal, five minutes.

218
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:19,416
Mini Mouse?

219
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,541
Crises, bro. I have to go.

220
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,041
She must have run out of candy floss..

221
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:25,583
..that's why she messaged Mickey Mouse.

222
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:26,666
What's all this?

223
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,916
Our planet's being attacked by alien dinosaurs.

224
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,166
So it's time to wear my underwear over my pants.

225
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:33,791
Got to go.

226
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:37,791
Superman to the rescue.

227
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,583
I gave him a hard time.

228
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,708
I was scared that he'll wet the sofa.

229
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,666
But still..

230
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:52,750
Bas***

231
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,083
He said yes, so you say no.

232
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,708
Simple and strong, okay.

233
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,583
Okay, who's going to listen to me?

234
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,208
You know dad.

235
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:03,708
Once he's made up his mind, there's no looking back.

236
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,750
But if you get hitched, what about me?

237
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,916
Look, tell Shetty this isn't some village in Mangalore.

238
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,791
We aren't in the 90's anymore.

239
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:15,291
Shove them aside...to move ahead with time.

240
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:16,875
You don't get it.

241
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,208
You need to understand, K, not me.

242
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:22,291
Come on, fight it out, K.

243
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:25,416
ATAH.com. - Correct.

244
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:31,750
'Apni Taqdeer Apni Haath'. (Your fate lies in your own hands)

245
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:32,750
No, just tell me.

246
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,625
How can one decide in a single meeting..

247
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:38,083
..that this is the one I want to spend my whole life with.

248
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:39,958
That's like utter bull***

249
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:41,791
His intentions are obvious.

250
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:43,666
He's a guy, so you know..

251
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:44,958
Exactly.

252
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,750
That's why most marriages don't work out these days.

253
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:48,583
There you go.

254
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:51,291
Bonding and vibing.

255
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,458
Trusting each other with your lives.

256
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:56,208
These things take time, like.. - You're right.

257
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:59,250
Like us. Just like us. - Exactly.

258
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,500
Tuning. Common interest.

259
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,583
And having fun with each other.

260
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,166
Like we do.

261
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,083
Shouldn't these things gel as well?

262
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:08,666
Tell me.

263
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:13,041
Actually, we're fit for each other.

264
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,291
Yeah.

265
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,291
We should get married.

266
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,916
Done. End of all problems.

267
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,791
We'll stay together...for every lifetime to come.

268
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:23,958
Awesome.

269
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,791
Come, come, get up.

270
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:27,208
Sorry.

271
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:30,833
Ladies..

272
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,000
The ladies in your house and gentlemen.

273
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:33,875
Good one.

274
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:37,041
You all are invited to our wedding.

275
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:38,250
Do come.

276
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,666
You too.

277
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,000
Sir, will you come?

278
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,791
And you? - Of course.

279
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:43,583
Cool.

280
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,208
So let's bunk lectures tomorrow and get married.

281
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,625
And we'll go honeymooning with the fees money.

282
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,250
Marriage!

283
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:55,250
Cheers, baby. Cheers.

284
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:15,000
"You're shining...like a diamond."

285
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,625
"Bring it on, sweetheart."

286
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:22,958
"You're shining...like a diamond."

287
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:26,958
"Bring it on, sweetheart."

288
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,458
"Swat logic away."

289
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,833
"It's always swings over the head."

290
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:46,833
"Less profit more loss."

291
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:48,625
"The Indian thing."

292
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,833
"Runs in the opposite way."

293
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,000
"Always growling back at you."

294
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,916
"Nothing later, everything now."

295
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:58,458
"The Indian thing."

296
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,375
Everyone thinks I am an idiot.

297
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:04,708
As if I created all the problems for myself.

298
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:08,083
I never had any problem until now.

299
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:10,666
Seema was born by the time I was 18.

300
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:11,708
Papa's there.

301
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:12,916
He will think nice for you.

302
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:17,125
"A E I O U...that's kind of making sense."

303
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,125
"Hey! What a feeling...wow."

304
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,416
"That's the AEIOU song."

305
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,125
"The ABCD well."

306
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:27,125
"Little bit of this, little bit of that."

307
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,333
"The Indian thing."

308
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:35,750
"You're shining...like a diamond."

309
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,333
"Bring it on, sweetheart."

310
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:43,791
"You're shining...like a diamond."

311
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:45,041
"Bring it on, sweetheart."

312
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:48,625
"Let it be."

313
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:52,541
"Don't make plans."

314
00:17:53,041 --> 00:18:01,375
"Don't repay today for tomorrow."

315
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:02,458
It's family tradition.

316
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:03,958
Family tradition.

317
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,958
I won't let anyone break it. Get it.

318
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:16,041
"You're shining...like a diamond."

319
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:17,708
"Bring it on, sweetheart."

320
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:24,041
"You're shining...like a diamond."

321
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:25,666
"Bring it on, sweetheart."

322
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:32,125
"You're shining...like a diamond."

323
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:33,708
"Bring it on, sweetheart."

324
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:39,666
"You're shining...like a diamond."

325
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:45,333
"Bring it on, sweetheart."

326
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,458
Give me that boy's number.

327
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:51,458
I'll show him.

328
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,500
K.

329
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,500
There's nothing I can't crack, okay.

330
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,125
So bring it on, sweetheart.

331
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,166
The other day what you said at the bar...

332
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:08,291
...were you serious about that?

333
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:11,833
That? 'Made for each other' bit? - Yeah.

334
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:13,583
Hold on.

335
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:17,791
Look, K. I'm not in a position to be serious.

336
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,333
This is no joke.

337
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:22,958
Hey...nice one, right. Position...serious?

338
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:24,833
Rhyming words. Right?

339
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:28,833
What if I say I was serious?

340
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:36,250
I'm getting engaged this week. - Engagement?

341
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,958
Engagement! What?

342
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,458
Are you serious?

343
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:44,458
Yes.

344
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:45,833
Just come here. - Where...

345
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:46,750
Come!

346
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,708
Look...it's just an engagement.

347
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,583
And it can be called off, right?

348
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:53,166
I'll teach that pervert a lesson...

349
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:54,541
...that he'll call off the engagement.

350
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:55,625
Just see what I do.

351
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,208
Just see. - Just wait.

352
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:58,333
What's the point?

353
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,916
First get engaged and then call it off? - Exactly.

354
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,375
Listen, dude, on principle I am not doing this.

355
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,250
What principle, K? What principle?

356
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,708
I'll get engaged only to the one I want to marry.

357
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,791
And I'll marry someone...

358
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:12,333
...who will always be there for me.

359
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:16,291
Like...for every lifetime.

360
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:19,500
Look, K, this isn't Universal Bar.

361
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,625
And I am not laughing either.

362
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:27,583
Locha.com (problem).

363
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,083
We're still in college. - So?

364
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:30,833
We're living on our fathers earnings.

365
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:32,416
We'll grow up someday, Dino.

366
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,750
I've no clue about what I'm going do an hour later.

367
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,500
How can I make plans about growing up?

368
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,416
And what will I say to Shetty?

369
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,208
He'll eat me for dinner.

370
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:43,041
Yes. I could've asked Mr.Nigam to talk to him.

371
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,875
But...he thinks I am the most useless boy on this planet.

372
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:49,875
Now what?

373
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,583
That's why I wasn't telling you.

374
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:57,500
Because I knew you can't do anything.

375
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,500
K, listen to me. - No. No!

376
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,541
This is my problem. I'll handle it myself.

377
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:08,750
Okay?

378
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,750
This is just bloody unreal.

379
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:19,416
Mrs. Khare's inviting us for dinner on the weekend?

380
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:20,500
Would you like to go?

381
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,708
I'll be in Delhi...

382
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:23,541
Just avoid these dinners.

383
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:24,333
I'm putting on weight.

384
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,208
Good morning, mom.

385
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:30,208
Good morning, papa.

386
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,916
Have all the clocks in the house stopped working?

387
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:36,083
You don't even have your exams.

388
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:40,083
I want to talk to you two.

389
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,500
Is it a big problem? - Yes.

390
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,666
Police case... - Police case?

391
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,750
Mom, you're just too much.

392
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,625
I want to take responsibility.

393
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:54,541
Oh God!

394
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,666
I'll share the household responsibilities.

395
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:58,000
Contribute as well.

396
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,500
Because... I can make some money...

397
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,500
...playing part-time music.

398
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:09,375
You're laughing?

399
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:12,166
I've offers from numerous bands.

400
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:16,166
Mom... - Sorry.

401
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:20,833
Papa.

402
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:23,708
Can you talk to a girl's father, please?

403
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:24,791
I am very serious.

404
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:26,416
Very good.

405
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:28,791
Have you chosen a girl for Dev?

406
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:32,791
No, for me.

407
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:42,250
1st April's has gone, son.

408
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,125
Is there a hidden camera? - No.

409
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:47,083
To make me a fool.

410
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:48,166
Very nice.

411
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:49,041
Very nice.

412
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:50,333
Nina, I am leaving.

413
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:54,333
Good one. Good one.

414
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:56,791
Papa.

415
00:22:57,291 --> 00:22:57,583
Papa. - What happened?

416
00:22:58,083 --> 00:22:59,000
It's very urgent.

417
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,458
It's the question of my life.

418
00:23:00,958 --> 00:23:02,500
It's not easy for me to stand here and... - Enough!

419
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,208
Papa, please. Just do this once.

420
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:06,416
Then I swear I'll always do as you say.

421
00:23:06,916 --> 00:23:07,708
I'll even stop all my nonsense.

422
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:09,541
Are you taking drugs?

423
00:23:10,041 --> 00:23:11,083
You're not in your senses. - Papa.

424
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:12,291
I don't have time for your nonsense.

425
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:13,541
Papa, please. Hold on.

426
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:15,500
I'm not saying I want to get married tomorrow.

427
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,458
Marriage? You?

428
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:19,208
Yes, papa, I was thinking...

429
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:22,583
I'll slap you silly!

430
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:24,083
What are you good for?

431
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:25,541
What are you good for?

432
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:27,625
If I take away this house, clothes, your pocket-money...

433
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:30,500
...you won't survive for a day.

434
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,625
All you can do is take your guitar and beg...

435
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:37,625
Papa...

436
00:23:59,083 --> 00:24:00,416
Hi. - Hi.

437
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:02,541
Come, let's go.

438
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:04,541
On this? - So.

439
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:07,125
Shall we buy a train ticket...to Bhayander?

440
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:08,083
What?

441
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:09,291
That will be better than this.

442
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:11,000
What?

443
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,958
Are you eloping or shifting home?

444
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:15,041
And are you going for a concert?

445
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:16,291
Where am I going to sit?

446
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:18,333
On the fender. - Okay, chill.

447
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:20,166
We'll take a few trips back and adjust the luggage.

448
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:22,833
What's the issue?

449
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:25,208
Hi, little one.

450
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:28,291
What's this? - I just saved the poor thing.

451
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:30,166
Big dogs were trying to scare him.

452
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:32,791
And I couldn't see his mother anywhere, so...

453
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:35,000
I hope you aren't thinking of taking him along.

454
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,916
Should I leave him alone again?

455
00:24:37,416 --> 00:24:38,500
Those dogs will kill him, Dino.

456
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,791
It's a street dog, just ditch it, K.

457
00:24:41,291 --> 00:24:43,000
Why don't you ditch your guitar?

458
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,458
That will make some space on the bike.

459
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:47,666
Again about my guitar.

460
00:24:48,166 --> 00:24:51,666
I don't believe this.

461
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,541
What happened?

462
00:25:20,041 --> 00:25:20,500
What happened?

463
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,916
Changing your mind?

464
00:25:23,416 --> 00:25:27,083
Actually, I just remembered something important.

465
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:31,083
What?

466
00:25:48,666 --> 00:25:52,166
I love you.

467
00:26:20,583 --> 00:26:24,083
Which way's Goa? - That way.

468
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:30,791
"Don't know this or that."

469
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:34,125
"Don't know who's what."

470
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:37,458
"I am alive today."

471
00:26:37,958 --> 00:26:40,875
"There's nothing more I know."

472
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:44,250
"I've nothing to do with the world."

473
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,875
"Pardon my disrespect."

474
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:51,083
"All I know."

475
00:26:51,583 --> 00:26:53,250
"When you're with me."

476
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:57,625
"I believe that's..."

477
00:26:58,125 --> 00:27:07,583
"...the path to my destination."

478
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:11,583
"The path to my destination."

479
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:29,250
Uncle, I swear.

480
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,791
I swear on my mother, I don't know... - Don't swear.

481
00:27:32,291 --> 00:27:33,791
Look, you two do everything together.

482
00:27:34,291 --> 00:27:35,166
Right?

483
00:27:35,666 --> 00:27:36,958
We do, uncle, but... - So, where is he?

484
00:27:37,458 --> 00:27:38,708
Listen, I just spoke to Dev.

485
00:27:39,208 --> 00:27:40,375
He said he'll take the first flight back.

486
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:41,500
I've been asking him for an hour.

487
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,916
All he says is he doesn't know.

488
00:27:43,416 --> 00:27:44,791
Where's my daughter?

489
00:27:45,291 --> 00:27:45,958
Where's my daughter?

490
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:48,250
You will have to tell me where my daughter is.

491
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:48,958
Please. - Mom.

492
00:27:49,458 --> 00:27:50,208
If I had known, ma'am...

493
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:53,000
...would I be yelling my heart out?

494
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,083
If Karishma doesn't return home tonight...

495
00:27:55,583 --> 00:27:57,250
...I'll file a kidnapping case against your son.

496
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:58,000
I'll get him arrested.

497
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,791
Mr. Shetty, the problem is with your daughter.

498
00:28:00,291 --> 00:28:00,583
She ran away because...

499
00:28:01,083 --> 00:28:01,416
...you were forcing her to get married.

500
00:28:01,916 --> 00:28:02,125
Forcing?

501
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:03,333
He just got involved in her mess.

502
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:05,083
And anyway, he's a big oaf.

503
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:07,666
Your son Dino's troubled the entire college.

504
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:08,916
He's a big troublemaker.

505
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:10,083
What are you doing at the airport?

506
00:28:10,583 --> 00:28:11,041
They left on a bike.

507
00:28:11,541 --> 00:28:11,833
Look for them on the roads.

508
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:12,583
Beer bar?

509
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:13,708
I have a permit.

510
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:14,500
The girl's family is here.

511
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,333
Your government officials come there every day...

512
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:16,041
...for protection money. - What?

513
00:28:16,541 --> 00:28:19,375
Ask yourself. Ask. - What?

514
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:20,791
Speak in Hindi. - I won't.

515
00:28:21,291 --> 00:28:22,000
Hindi... - I won't.

516
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,125
Then how am I going to understand?

517
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:27,125
I don't understand.

518
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,208
Can you believe this?

519
00:28:40,708 --> 00:28:45,375
The two of us, like this! - Really.

520
00:28:45,875 --> 00:28:48,208
K, are we making a blunder?

521
00:28:48,708 --> 00:28:51,541
Because it's still not too late.

522
00:28:52,041 --> 00:28:54,125
I am scared too.

523
00:28:54,625 --> 00:28:56,000
But, Dino, I am confident.

524
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,625
We're doing the right thing.

525
00:28:58,125 --> 00:29:00,666
It's our life, we'll decide what to do.

526
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:04,666
ATAH.com.

527
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:08,750
And when we've decided...

528
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,791
...then we should get rewarded too.

529
00:29:12,291 --> 00:29:14,125
Sweet reward of hard work.

530
00:29:14,625 --> 00:29:15,208
I am stinking.

531
00:29:15,708 --> 00:29:17,291
I'm covered in dirt and grime from head to toe.

532
00:29:17,791 --> 00:29:21,583
Let me clean it for you.

533
00:29:22,083 --> 00:29:26,583
Cheap behavior.

534
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:30,625
Go out and make Jerry's bed.

535
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:34,291
Here.

536
00:29:34,791 --> 00:29:38,291
Do some more hard work.

537
00:29:42,916 --> 00:29:46,416
You little...

538
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,041
Hello, dirty boy.

539
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:57,666
Time for your reward...

540
00:29:58,166 --> 00:30:00,083
Dino.

541
00:30:00,583 --> 00:30:03,208
Dino.

542
00:30:03,708 --> 00:30:07,208
Oh, God!

543
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,625
Is the air conditioner and water working?

544
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:28,500
Yes, all in working condition.

545
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,125
Chill man. Enjoy yourself.

546
00:30:30,625 --> 00:30:33,958
Take care, bro. Thanks.

547
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:35,416
K. K. K, What do you think of the place?

548
00:30:35,916 --> 00:30:37,041
Dino, this is so cool.

549
00:30:37,541 --> 00:30:38,291
This is awesome.

550
00:30:38,791 --> 00:30:40,666
Oh my, God. This is like a dream.

551
00:30:41,166 --> 00:30:43,375
We'll live like we want, do what we like.

552
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:44,625
Can you believe this?

553
00:30:45,125 --> 00:30:45,708
Okay, so listen. - Okay.

554
00:30:46,208 --> 00:30:46,875
The view from here is the best.

555
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:48,333
So we'll keep our bed here.

556
00:30:48,833 --> 00:30:49,666
And we won't keep too many things in the hall.

557
00:30:50,166 --> 00:30:50,958
Like plain types. - Okay.

558
00:30:51,458 --> 00:30:53,416
The room at the back is for your music.

559
00:30:53,916 --> 00:30:56,083
And the other room that side will be my studio.

560
00:30:56,583 --> 00:30:56,958
What do you think?

561
00:30:57,458 --> 00:31:01,083
Princess, we'll do as you say.

562
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:02,416
So excited.

563
00:31:02,916 --> 00:31:03,750
By the way, I am starving.

564
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,833
First prawn-curry rice?

565
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:06,875
Shall we?

566
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:09,541
Let's go get Jerry. Come.

567
00:31:10,041 --> 00:31:12,208
Come on.

568
00:31:12,708 --> 00:31:18,250
I am not hungry, sweetheart, I am craving.

569
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:21,541
The crave of youth.

570
00:31:22,041 --> 00:31:23,250
Dino.

571
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,125
Why do you behave like a villain...

572
00:31:25,625 --> 00:31:26,416
...every time you get romantic?

573
00:31:26,916 --> 00:31:29,041
Because heroes are happy with singing songs.

574
00:31:29,541 --> 00:31:33,750
But villains want the same thing...that I want.

575
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:37,833
Yuck! Creep.

576
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:40,583
Listen, Jerry's hungry too.

577
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:42,333
Let's go.

578
00:31:42,833 --> 00:31:44,500
Sweety!

579
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,125
He's the real villain.

580
00:31:46,625 --> 00:31:50,125
I'll kill him someday, or else...

581
00:32:06,041 --> 00:32:10,291
Thank you.

582
00:32:10,791 --> 00:32:14,708
I...

583
00:32:15,208 --> 00:32:18,708
No one's done all this for me.

584
00:32:27,375 --> 00:32:31,833
I...I never felt so special.

585
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:35,833
And...

586
00:32:40,791 --> 00:32:44,250
But that doesn't mean you behave cheaply.

587
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:45,666
It's a massive turnoff.

588
00:32:46,166 --> 00:32:48,416
There's something called as a joke.

589
00:32:48,916 --> 00:32:50,291
No one in your family has a clue about it.

590
00:32:50,791 --> 00:32:51,083
Jerry.

591
00:32:51,583 --> 00:32:52,333
Just serious.

592
00:32:52,833 --> 00:32:53,166
Jerry.

593
00:32:53,666 --> 00:32:57,541
Eat rice plate and drink rum.

594
00:32:58,041 --> 00:33:04,250
"I don't know how to pluck stars."

595
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,583
"Even if I get you stars..."

596
00:33:08,083 --> 00:33:10,875
"...what will you do with them?"

597
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:17,833
"What do I try to prove with my antics?"

598
00:33:18,333 --> 00:33:21,833
"I'll tell you in simple words what you mean for me."

599
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,166
"I don't know about promises."

600
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:44,875
"I don't know about rites and rituals."

601
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:51,708
"I don't know the types of true love."

602
00:33:52,208 --> 00:33:55,250
"I've nothing to do with the world."

603
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,375
"Pardon my disrespect."

604
00:33:57,875 --> 00:34:01,916
"All I know."

605
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:04,166
"When you're with me."

606
00:34:04,666 --> 00:34:08,500
"I believe that's..."

607
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:19,541
"...the path to my destination."

608
00:34:20,041 --> 00:34:25,250
"The path to my destination."

609
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:32,625
"The path to my destination."

610
00:34:33,125 --> 00:34:36,625
"The path to my destination."

611
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:03,208
So...

612
00:35:03,708 --> 00:35:05,375
How about a hot shower?

613
00:35:05,875 --> 00:35:07,416
I mean together.

614
00:35:07,916 --> 00:35:09,333
What?

615
00:35:09,833 --> 00:35:12,000
The bike's this way. - Jerry ran away.

616
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:16,000
Son of a...beach!

617
00:35:18,708 --> 00:35:22,208
Hey...

618
00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:23,833
Just listen.

619
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:25,416
But that's my bro. - Something's wrong.

620
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:27,666
They're here to catch us, okay.

621
00:35:28,166 --> 00:35:29,833
Look, dad has sent Mahesh as well.

622
00:35:30,333 --> 00:35:33,291
They must have found the bike.

623
00:35:33,791 --> 00:35:34,333
We have to leave.

624
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:35,375
Quickly.

625
00:35:35,875 --> 00:35:36,291
Dino.

626
00:35:36,791 --> 00:35:38,916
But, brother...how?

627
00:35:39,416 --> 00:35:42,916
Dino, come on.

628
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:17,166
What kind of a place is this?

629
00:36:17,666 --> 00:36:21,166
Welcome to nowhere.

630
00:36:24,375 --> 00:36:27,125
This route...leads to Karnataka.

631
00:36:27,625 --> 00:36:28,708
No, not really.

632
00:36:29,208 --> 00:36:30,791
We should've eloped next year.

633
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:32,916
No one can legally stop us after we're 21.

634
00:36:33,416 --> 00:36:34,708
This is a huge country.

635
00:36:35,208 --> 00:36:37,000
There's no dearth of places to hide.

636
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,250
We just have to avoid obvious places like Goa.

637
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,083
So let me see. - Cool.

638
00:36:42,583 --> 00:36:46,750
So what unobvious place can we go to?

639
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:47,666
This.

640
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:48,791
This, my princess.

641
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:50,041
We'll go here.

642
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,500
Right to the heart of the country.

643
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,291
Nagpur. Really?

644
00:36:54,791 --> 00:36:55,375
I have an uncle.

645
00:36:55,875 --> 00:36:56,208
Cousin-types.

646
00:36:56,708 --> 00:36:57,625
But he's darn cool.

647
00:36:58,125 --> 00:37:00,125
Beer, smokes...all chilled.

648
00:37:00,625 --> 00:37:01,833
We'll be safe here.

649
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:03,083
Are you sure?

650
00:37:03,583 --> 00:37:06,625
He's not a simple guy, he's a rascal.

651
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:10,625
I know all his secrets.

652
00:37:15,416 --> 00:37:17,083
What happened, princess?

653
00:37:17,583 --> 00:37:20,041
What happened?

654
00:37:20,541 --> 00:37:21,791
I am nervous, Dino.

655
00:37:22,291 --> 00:37:23,666
I am scared.

656
00:37:24,166 --> 00:37:27,666
What if we're caught?

657
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:33,416
Are we sure about each other?

658
00:37:33,916 --> 00:37:35,083
Idiot.

659
00:37:35,583 --> 00:37:37,416
Isn't it too late to doubt?

660
00:37:37,916 --> 00:37:39,750
No, I was just checking.

661
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:43,750
Because I have an idea. - What?

662
00:37:53,375 --> 00:37:54,750
I've nothing more, I'm going.

663
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:56,291
It's a life-long bond, sir...

664
00:37:56,791 --> 00:37:58,500
Here, keep it.

665
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,583
Small town innocence, my foot.

666
00:38:01,083 --> 00:38:02,333
They can put the Mumbai's crooks to shame.

667
00:38:02,833 --> 00:38:06,750
Relax, the job's done... Mr. Shetty.

668
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:09,333
Oh yeah, I am Shetty.

669
00:38:09,833 --> 00:38:11,500
You know Mrs. Nigam.

670
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,750
From earth to sky.

671
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,583
From doomsday... - Happy.

672
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:21,583
Yeah, obviously.

673
00:38:47,166 --> 00:38:48,583
Now that you're here, you can stay.

674
00:38:49,083 --> 00:38:50,500
What can be done?

675
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,500
Girl, finish that.

676
00:38:57,208 --> 00:38:59,458
Don't worry, uncle's darn cool.

677
00:38:59,958 --> 00:39:01,416
Right, uncle. You're darn cool, right?

678
00:39:01,916 --> 00:39:02,458
You're chilled.

679
00:39:02,958 --> 00:39:03,500
Poor girl is scared.

680
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,375
You're chilled.

681
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:07,125
She should be scared.

682
00:39:07,625 --> 00:39:11,125
I'm her uncle, she should be scared.

683
00:39:24,916 --> 00:39:27,333
Uncle, you scared us.

684
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:29,791
Okay, okay, okay, it's fine.

685
00:39:30,291 --> 00:39:33,458
It's okay. Breathe. Breathe.

686
00:39:33,958 --> 00:39:34,666
Listen, chill.

687
00:39:35,166 --> 00:39:36,875
Stay here comfortably, we'll have a ball later.

688
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,333
And no need to go back...

689
00:39:38,833 --> 00:39:42,083
...until your family doesn't call you back. - 100%.

690
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:46,083
He's too cool.

691
00:39:48,541 --> 00:39:50,166
You can sleep here.

692
00:39:50,666 --> 00:39:52,708
And you upstairs.

693
00:39:53,208 --> 00:39:53,750
By the way, I've no problem...

694
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:55,208
...if you want to sleep together.

695
00:39:55,708 --> 00:39:58,375
Sure, we'll stay in one room... - No, no, we're fine.

696
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:02,125
It's cool. - Different rooms.

697
00:40:02,625 --> 00:40:03,666
We're fine.

698
00:40:04,166 --> 00:40:07,666
We're fine.

699
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:38,333
You were waiting for me, weren't you?

700
00:40:40,458 --> 00:40:43,958
Shall we begin...

701
00:40:47,125 --> 00:40:50,416
Dino...

702
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:53,500
I am still scared.

703
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,500
I'll get rid of your stress, sweetheart.

704
00:41:12,916 --> 00:41:13,958
What?

705
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:16,208
We're married. I've a certificate.

706
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:20,583
We've a marriage certificate, but not for kids.

707
00:41:21,083 --> 00:41:24,583
What?

708
00:41:27,291 --> 00:41:31,000
Do you have that? Protection?

709
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:35,000
Oh no...

710
00:41:37,375 --> 00:41:38,583
Uncle. - What?

711
00:41:39,083 --> 00:41:40,583
He's a bachelor, I'm sure he has one. - What?

712
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:41,958
I'll find one. - Don't ask your uncle for it.

713
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:43,875
How bad is that? - By God, Mrs. Nigam.

714
00:41:44,375 --> 00:41:49,125
We're going to do this today. - Dino.

715
00:41:49,625 --> 00:41:53,125
Dino...you're such an a**.

716
00:42:02,666 --> 00:42:03,041
Where is it?

717
00:42:03,541 --> 00:42:07,041
Where could he have kept it?

718
00:42:12,875 --> 00:42:14,666
Cool uncle.

719
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:16,500
Jerry, be quiet.

720
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,875
If you catch the first flight you'll make it here early.

721
00:42:19,375 --> 00:42:21,375
He's right here.

722
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:25,625
I'll keep them here.

723
00:42:26,125 --> 00:42:29,583
They won't go anywhere, just get here.

724
00:42:30,083 --> 00:42:30,375
Oh no.

725
00:42:30,875 --> 00:42:33,833
Are you going to keep yelling over the phone?

726
00:42:34,333 --> 00:42:38,125
Get here soon.

727
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:40,500
We're sc***** - What?

728
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,500
The ba***** - Who?

729
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,916
The bloody uncle.

730
00:42:44,416 --> 00:42:45,333
He squealed on us. - What?

731
00:42:45,833 --> 00:42:47,833
Dino, what? - I don't know what's wrong with my people.

732
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:48,625
I knew it. I knew it.

733
00:42:49,125 --> 00:42:49,625
I told you, Dino.

734
00:42:50,125 --> 00:42:50,750
Take your stuff and run.

735
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:51,500
I don't believe this.

736
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,625
Let's get the hell out of here now. Come on.

737
00:42:53,125 --> 00:42:55,125
Oh, God. Where's my jacket? - I got it.

738
00:42:55,625 --> 00:42:56,916
Come on. - Dino...

739
00:42:57,416 --> 00:42:58,791
Did you pick up my rings?

740
00:42:59,291 --> 00:43:02,791
Oh, God. - Come on, Jerry.

741
00:43:04,708 --> 00:43:08,625
How will they come out?

742
00:43:09,125 --> 00:43:12,625
They must be asleep.

743
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:22,750
Oh no.

744
00:43:23,958 --> 00:43:27,458
The boy's got guts.

745
00:43:29,125 --> 00:43:30,375
Beer?

746
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:33,458
Beer.

747
00:43:33,958 --> 00:43:37,458
Bloody hell.

748
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:45,625
Okay.

749
00:43:46,125 --> 00:43:48,291
And since we're on the railway tracks...

750
00:43:48,791 --> 00:43:49,958
...we've two choices.

751
00:43:50,458 --> 00:43:52,333
This way and that.

752
00:43:52,833 --> 00:43:53,708
Where do you want to go?

753
00:43:54,208 --> 00:43:55,791
Hahahaha...what a funny joke.

754
00:43:56,291 --> 00:43:57,083
You're enjoying yourself, aren't you?

755
00:43:57,583 --> 00:43:58,958
Why are you spoiling the mood?

756
00:43:59,458 --> 00:44:00,750
So it didn't work out with uncle, that's okay.

757
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:02,291
We'll plan something else.

758
00:44:02,791 --> 00:44:03,916
Dino. You never listen to me.

759
00:44:04,416 --> 00:44:05,458
I told you... - Chill.

760
00:44:05,958 --> 00:44:08,416
Relax. Relax, just take it easy. - What relax?

761
00:44:08,916 --> 00:44:10,416
You almost got us caught twice.

762
00:44:10,916 --> 00:44:12,041
And where have we landed up?

763
00:44:12,541 --> 00:44:13,500
You should say sorry.

764
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,041
Get serious and think of something.

765
00:44:15,541 --> 00:44:17,916
But, Mr. Rockstar's focus is no making up jokes.

766
00:44:18,416 --> 00:44:19,666
What? Why should I say sorry?

767
00:44:20,166 --> 00:44:21,166
Of course, you'll become less of a man, right?

768
00:44:21,666 --> 00:44:23,958
And don't mistake yourself for a princess.

769
00:44:24,458 --> 00:44:25,000
I do all the jobs.

770
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:26,666
I make all the plans... and you will sit like this only...

771
00:44:27,166 --> 00:44:28,750
...and only yak all day.

772
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:30,583
Bull****.

773
00:44:31,083 --> 00:44:33,083
You know what, you're right.

774
00:44:33,583 --> 00:44:35,250
I was blindly following you.

775
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:36,708
But you're blind yourself.

776
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:40,083
Now I'll decide what to do next, not you.

777
00:44:40,583 --> 00:44:42,333
Applause.

778
00:44:42,833 --> 00:44:43,875
Finally your eyes have opened.

779
00:44:44,375 --> 00:44:44,833
Good morning.

780
00:44:45,333 --> 00:44:49,166
Make a plan.

781
00:44:49,666 --> 00:44:50,916
Our parents will give consent...

782
00:44:51,416 --> 00:44:55,125
...only when they realize that we won't give up.

783
00:44:55,625 --> 00:44:58,916
That can take a week or two...maybe a month?

784
00:44:59,416 --> 00:45:00,416
Fine.

785
00:45:00,916 --> 00:45:04,666
This leads to Mumbai, so we'll go that way.

786
00:45:05,166 --> 00:45:06,625
Hey, that's what I was saying.

787
00:45:07,125 --> 00:45:08,500
I said that in the beginning.

788
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,750
Hello.

789
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:14,416
See. Now this looks like an unobvious place.

790
00:45:14,916 --> 00:45:15,500
And very pretty.

791
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,500
It's named after Ash. - Really?

792
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:18,375
Raipur.

793
00:45:18,875 --> 00:45:22,375
No one can imagine that we're here. - Yeah!

794
00:45:25,416 --> 00:45:26,833
Bro...where is it?

795
00:45:27,333 --> 00:45:28,208
Just a little further, sir.

796
00:45:28,708 --> 00:45:31,250
It's got everything. Air conditioning, television. Everything.

797
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:33,791
You won't find a better hotel in this city.

798
00:45:34,291 --> 00:45:35,875
The entire city looks like Crawford Market.

799
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:37,875
Right? - Yes.

800
00:45:38,375 --> 00:45:39,958
All I want is a nice hotel.

801
00:45:40,458 --> 00:45:44,333
First I'll take a hot bath and then a chilled beer. - Yes.

802
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:46,583
High five.

803
00:45:47,083 --> 00:45:48,791
High five.

804
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:50,375
High five.

805
00:45:50,875 --> 00:45:52,708
High five. High five. High five.

806
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:56,166
Sir, 7500 advance please.

807
00:45:56,666 --> 00:45:57,458
Consider this your own hotel.

808
00:45:57,958 --> 00:45:58,916
Stay here comfortably.

809
00:45:59,416 --> 00:46:01,041
The place is too good.

810
00:46:01,541 --> 00:46:02,791
Too good.

811
00:46:03,291 --> 00:46:04,916
K, lend me some money.

812
00:46:05,416 --> 00:46:06,500
Pay me my 10% first. - Fine.

813
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:07,583
I don't want any hassles later.

814
00:46:08,083 --> 00:46:11,583
Okay? - Fine.

815
00:46:13,875 --> 00:46:14,458
What?

816
00:46:14,958 --> 00:46:16,666
I paid for the marriage certificate.

817
00:46:17,166 --> 00:46:18,458
Is this all you got?

818
00:46:18,958 --> 00:46:20,625
Dino, did you ask me to get more?

819
00:46:21,125 --> 00:46:22,291
You should've used your mind.

820
00:46:22,791 --> 00:46:23,708
I emptied brother's drawer.

821
00:46:24,208 --> 00:46:24,666
Excuse me, sir.

822
00:46:25,166 --> 00:46:27,500
We accept credit card. - Yes.

823
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:33,416
They will trace it. - So what now?

824
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:34,916
What now?

825
00:46:35,416 --> 00:46:36,083
Sing a song.

826
00:46:36,583 --> 00:46:39,333
"You're next to me, I'm next to you."

827
00:46:39,833 --> 00:46:42,291
You wasted my time, and are still wondering what to do.

828
00:46:42,791 --> 00:46:44,958
If you don't have money you can get lost.

829
00:46:45,458 --> 00:46:46,791
Get me some water. - It's right there.

830
00:46:47,291 --> 00:46:48,583
Help yourself.

831
00:46:49,083 --> 00:46:50,291
Water. - Give him some water.

832
00:46:50,791 --> 00:46:54,291
Cold water.

833
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:19,000
What a dump.

834
00:47:21,625 --> 00:47:22,708
What a relief.

835
00:47:23,208 --> 00:47:28,000
My system was in a mess. since we eloped.

836
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:29,416
Dino, yuck.

837
00:47:29,916 --> 00:47:31,583
It's stinking.

838
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:35,583
Does your s**t smell like roses?

839
00:47:41,166 --> 00:47:44,125
Take your hair out of it.

840
00:47:44,625 --> 00:47:47,083
Dino, there's just one towel and you...

841
00:47:47,583 --> 00:47:51,083
And after doing that.

842
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:56,083
What the hell.

843
00:47:56,583 --> 00:48:00,416
You...cheap behavior.

844
00:48:00,916 --> 00:48:02,708
300 x 30 is 9000.

845
00:48:03,208 --> 00:48:05,166
That covers rent and transportation.

846
00:48:05,666 --> 00:48:09,375
Entertainment...5000.

847
00:48:09,875 --> 00:48:13,083
So...after including shopping...

848
00:48:13,583 --> 00:48:15,583
...it comes to 28,000 per month.

849
00:48:16,083 --> 00:48:18,791
And we have just 4500.

850
00:48:19,291 --> 00:48:22,083
I wish I had my motorcycle.

851
00:48:22,583 --> 00:48:27,125
We wouldn't have to worry for 2-3 months.

852
00:48:27,625 --> 00:48:31,125
Here, Jerry boy.

853
00:48:34,083 --> 00:48:35,125
Good boy.

854
00:48:35,625 --> 00:48:40,125
I thought...we'll have lots of fun like always.

855
00:48:40,625 --> 00:48:43,666
We can never have a problem.

856
00:48:44,166 --> 00:48:48,708
Open sky, mountains, river...

857
00:48:49,208 --> 00:48:53,958
...and a beautiful house amongst it all.

858
00:48:54,458 --> 00:48:56,791
But now I can see it.

859
00:48:57,291 --> 00:49:03,416
The difference between fairy tale and reality.

860
00:49:03,916 --> 00:49:07,875
You know, K...as long as we're together...

861
00:49:08,375 --> 00:49:12,625
...we can turn reality into a fairy tale.

862
00:49:13,125 --> 00:49:15,916
We'll find that beautiful house.

863
00:49:16,416 --> 00:49:19,916
Just see.

864
00:49:43,333 --> 00:49:45,958
K, this place is perfect for us.

865
00:49:46,458 --> 00:49:48,375
Why? - Its away from the city.

866
00:49:48,875 --> 00:49:50,250
It won't cost much.

867
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:54,125
Look. There's a guesthouse on this mountain.

868
00:49:54,625 --> 00:49:55,250
River flowing below.

869
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:56,291
Darn cool, right.

870
00:49:56,791 --> 00:49:58,833
I think it's my first trip to a jungle.

871
00:49:59,333 --> 00:50:00,500
You know what's really cool? - What?

872
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,958
Ram and Sita got together in this jungle.

873
00:50:04,458 --> 00:50:05,625
Really? Where?

874
00:50:06,125 --> 00:50:09,625
Not this one. That was someplace else.

875
00:50:13,083 --> 00:50:13,416
Come out.

876
00:50:13,916 --> 00:50:15,708
What are you carrying?

877
00:50:16,208 --> 00:50:17,125
Oh, God. Police.

878
00:50:17,625 --> 00:50:21,125
Police outside.

879
00:50:24,375 --> 00:50:24,833
Look.

880
00:50:25,333 --> 00:50:25,875
Let it be.

881
00:50:26,375 --> 00:50:27,625
This has become a daily routine.

882
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:28,750
Something must have happened again.

883
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:31,166
They really trouble us a lot.

884
00:50:31,666 --> 00:50:33,625
Mister...what's going on?

885
00:50:34,125 --> 00:50:35,333
We're being pounded...

886
00:50:35,833 --> 00:50:38,208
On one side is the police and on the other are the Maoists.

887
00:50:38,708 --> 00:50:39,583
Get it.

888
00:50:40,083 --> 00:50:41,125
This is a checking.

889
00:50:41,625 --> 00:50:44,458
I hope you've an ID card.

890
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:46,791
Will we be caught?

891
00:50:47,291 --> 00:50:51,208
What are Maoists?

892
00:50:51,708 --> 00:50:52,750
Stop. Stop. Come on.

893
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:56,750
Stop.

894
00:51:04,083 --> 00:51:05,500
Boss, excuse me. - Yes.

895
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,958
Isn't there a forest lodge up ahead? - Yes.

896
00:51:08,458 --> 00:51:11,208
Oh, good. Will we get a room? - No.

897
00:51:11,708 --> 00:51:15,333
All the rooms are booked. - Oh no.

898
00:51:15,833 --> 00:51:18,791
It's booked by the police. Interrogation centre.

899
00:51:19,291 --> 00:51:21,083
For the Maoists.

900
00:51:21,583 --> 00:51:25,458
Mao...Maoists? Again.

901
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:27,125
I shouldn't have listened.

902
00:51:27,625 --> 00:51:28,958
I should've never listened to you.

903
00:51:29,458 --> 00:51:31,458
You're such a... - What?

904
00:51:31,958 --> 00:51:33,375
If you're so smart then why are you with me?

905
00:51:33,875 --> 00:51:34,958
I am not smart, I am a duffer.

906
00:51:35,458 --> 00:51:38,958
Happy?

907
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,041
Come on, we've arrived.

908
00:51:47,541 --> 00:51:48,250
Come on, hurry up. - Come.

909
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:49,166
We've to get down here.

910
00:51:49,666 --> 00:51:50,333
Come on.

911
00:51:50,833 --> 00:51:51,416
Come on.

912
00:51:51,916 --> 00:51:52,041
Come on.

913
00:51:52,541 --> 00:51:53,125
Thank you, sir.

914
00:51:53,625 --> 00:51:53,958
Thank you very much.

915
00:51:54,458 --> 00:51:55,333
Where will you go now?

916
00:51:55,833 --> 00:51:57,500
Come with me.

917
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,083
K? - Yes, let's go.

918
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:01,125
Come, see our village.

919
00:52:01,625 --> 00:52:04,666
They'll publish about this place in their newspaper.

920
00:52:05,166 --> 00:52:08,666
Come on, hurry up.

921
00:53:08,416 --> 00:53:12,208
Welcome.

922
00:53:12,708 --> 00:53:13,541
I'll be right back.

923
00:53:14,041 --> 00:53:16,250
I'll have to speak to my wife. - Yes, sir.

924
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:20,250
Here. - Thank you.

925
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:38,375
Now what's so funny?

926
00:53:38,875 --> 00:53:40,791
I can imagine everyone's face.

927
00:53:41,291 --> 00:53:43,958
Uzi, Juhi, Milind.

928
00:53:44,458 --> 00:53:45,500
You know something.

929
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,166
We know everything about US and Europe.

930
00:53:48,666 --> 00:53:51,083
But we don't have a clue about our own country.

931
00:53:51,583 --> 00:53:53,500
I swear their faces will be worth watching...

932
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,333
...when we tell them we've been to Bastar and Dantewara.

933
00:53:56,833 --> 00:53:58,541
Just imagine Uzi's reaction.

934
00:53:59,041 --> 00:54:01,583
Mr. Distant Future, let's think about tomorrow first.

935
00:54:02,083 --> 00:54:02,541
Yes.

936
00:54:03,041 --> 00:54:04,708
I think Heera's a nice man.

937
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:06,958
He can help us. - Exactly.

938
00:54:07,458 --> 00:54:09,416
And let's get a small place with his help..

939
00:54:09,916 --> 00:54:12,166
...and spend some tension-free days.

940
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:13,541
I swear.

941
00:54:14,041 --> 00:54:15,500
Enough of running around.

942
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,958
If we can find a decent place, that's good enough.

943
00:54:20,458 --> 00:54:23,958
I just want to relax.

944
00:54:51,083 --> 00:54:52,125
Dino.

945
00:54:52,625 --> 00:54:54,916
Dino.

946
00:54:55,416 --> 00:54:56,833
Oh, God. You've got fever.

947
00:54:57,333 --> 00:55:00,833
Dino. - Water.

948
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:04,333
Come on, hurry up.

949
00:55:04,833 --> 00:55:05,166
We've to get out.

950
00:55:05,666 --> 00:55:06,916
Pooja, Jeetu. - What's happening?

951
00:55:07,416 --> 00:55:07,875
Come on. - The police are coming.

952
00:55:08,375 --> 00:55:08,833
Get up. - Police?

953
00:55:09,333 --> 00:55:10,541
Why the police? - We're Maoists.

954
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:13,000
Extremists. - What?

955
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:13,791
Hurry up, son.

956
00:55:14,291 --> 00:55:14,875
Oh no.

957
00:55:15,375 --> 00:55:15,750
What are you doing?

958
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:18,041
Don't you dare move? - We've to run.

959
00:55:18,541 --> 00:55:19,083
No way, you're not going anywhere.

960
00:55:19,583 --> 00:55:20,458
Lie down. - Karishma, we can't get caught.

961
00:55:20,958 --> 00:55:22,291
Are you crazy? Lie down.

962
00:55:22,791 --> 00:55:27,208
At any cost, I won't let papa win.

963
00:55:27,708 --> 00:55:31,208
Run, run.

964
00:55:55,375 --> 00:55:55,916
Dino.

965
00:55:56,416 --> 00:55:58,416
Dino, are you alright?

966
00:55:58,916 --> 00:55:59,500
We can't stop.

967
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,500
Hurry up.

968
00:56:20,583 --> 00:56:22,583
How's everything, Sumiran?

969
00:56:23,083 --> 00:56:26,583
All okay?

970
00:56:29,333 --> 00:56:29,916
Here you go.

971
00:56:30,416 --> 00:56:33,916
Swallow this, you will feel better.

972
00:56:43,208 --> 00:56:44,250
K.

973
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:46,625
K.

974
00:56:47,125 --> 00:56:50,625
K, let's go.

975
00:56:58,458 --> 00:57:00,541
Come.

976
00:57:01,041 --> 00:57:05,083
How are you, Heera?

977
00:57:05,583 --> 00:57:07,041
Come with me.

978
00:57:07,541 --> 00:57:09,208
Couldn't you find another jungle?

979
00:57:09,708 --> 00:57:10,791
Come on.

980
00:57:11,291 --> 00:57:12,541
I swear I didn't know.

981
00:57:13,041 --> 00:57:13,791
I swear on you.

982
00:57:14,291 --> 00:57:16,500
Otherwise, why would I shoot without your permission?

983
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:17,291
Fine.

984
00:57:17,791 --> 00:57:18,708
I swear...I'll never do it again.

985
00:57:19,208 --> 00:57:20,083
Bring forth your hand. - No.

986
00:57:20,583 --> 00:57:22,250
Tell me does it need more salt?

987
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:24,333
Taste it. How's the salt?

988
00:57:24,833 --> 00:57:26,375
It's nice. Very nice.

989
00:57:26,875 --> 00:57:30,625
Isn't it too much? - It is.

990
00:57:31,125 --> 00:57:35,416
Look...I've heard good things about your dance group.

991
00:57:35,916 --> 00:57:36,250
Yes...

992
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:39,625
Can I make a request? - Just give the orders.

993
00:57:40,125 --> 00:57:41,875
We haven't been to a cinema hall for ages.

994
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:46,958
So I want you to show us a glimpse of the movies.

995
00:57:47,458 --> 00:57:49,458
Yes. Yes. - It's a request. Please.

996
00:57:49,958 --> 00:57:53,125
What are you... - Dau.

997
00:57:53,625 --> 00:57:55,125
Who are they?

998
00:57:55,625 --> 00:57:56,625
They are reporters?

999
00:57:57,125 --> 00:57:59,500
As you know the youth are taking the media by storm.

1000
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:00,583
So I've brought them here...

1001
00:58:01,083 --> 00:58:04,875
...to show them our condition.

1002
00:58:05,375 --> 00:58:07,125
Breaking news.

1003
00:58:07,625 --> 00:58:11,666
Look, you cannot go anywhere.

1004
00:58:12,166 --> 00:58:15,083
Because it threatens our security.

1005
00:58:15,583 --> 00:58:16,583
Get it.

1006
00:58:17,083 --> 00:58:22,291
Sir, where can we possibly go in this jungle?

1007
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:23,708
Good.

1008
00:58:24,208 --> 00:58:26,000
Dau. - Go ahead, Heera.

1009
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:29,250
I was saying...

1010
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:31,375
Look. Dada's here. I'll be back.

1011
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:32,208
Okay.

1012
00:58:32,708 --> 00:58:33,916
You never know when the police will raid this place.

1013
00:58:34,416 --> 00:58:35,750
And we'll have to run.

1014
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:38,041
We're constantly under threat.

1015
00:58:38,541 --> 00:58:41,583
Who knows what's going to happen. - Right.

1016
00:58:42,083 --> 00:58:43,208
What?

1017
00:58:43,708 --> 00:58:47,083
Where's the toilet?

1018
00:58:47,583 --> 00:58:51,083
Come on.

1019
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,500
Go that way.

1020
00:59:18,916 --> 00:59:20,000
Holy s***

1021
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:21,708
I'll be right back. K, camera.

1022
00:59:22,208 --> 00:59:22,875
Where's your camera?

1023
00:59:23,375 --> 00:59:23,625
K, camera.

1024
00:59:24,125 --> 00:59:25,125
Where's the camera? Where's the camera, K?

1025
00:59:25,625 --> 00:59:28,041
This picture is worth framing.

1026
00:59:28,541 --> 00:59:29,791
This is just too funny, man.

1027
00:59:30,291 --> 00:59:32,875
This is...

1028
00:59:33,375 --> 00:59:35,625
What?

1029
00:59:36,125 --> 00:59:37,208
What else can we do here?

1030
00:59:37,708 --> 00:59:38,500
This is a jungle.

1031
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,666
Come on, cheer up.

1032
00:59:43,166 --> 00:59:46,666
Isn't that funny?

1033
00:59:48,708 --> 00:59:51,416
Hey!

1034
00:59:51,916 --> 00:59:53,250
What the hell is wrong with you? - You!

1035
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:55,000
You! You! You! Goddamnit, you!

1036
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:57,000
You've a problem with your dad.

1037
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:59,375
But I'm the one that's going to suffer and die.

1038
00:59:59,875 --> 01:00:01,458
Even if I escape wild animals and sickness...

1039
01:00:01,958 --> 01:00:03,583
...someone will definitely shoot me.

1040
01:00:04,083 --> 01:00:05,041
And for what? - Yeah, for what?

1041
01:00:05,541 --> 01:00:06,208
Your bloody selfishness. - I see.

1042
01:00:06,708 --> 01:00:06,916
Shut up. - I see...

1043
01:00:07,416 --> 01:00:09,750
Does it strike you what I am facing?

1044
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:12,583
All you care about is your stupid jokes. That's all.

1045
01:00:13,083 --> 01:00:13,458
I was only... - Just shut up.

1046
01:00:13,958 --> 01:00:14,541
You're the bloody joke.

1047
01:00:15,041 --> 01:00:16,125
Quiet!

1048
01:00:16,625 --> 01:00:17,208
Why did we elope?

1049
01:00:17,708 --> 01:00:18,125
I had no intention of coming here.

1050
01:00:18,625 --> 01:00:19,416
You think I intended to? - Yes.

1051
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:20,958
This is all your fault.

1052
01:00:21,458 --> 01:00:23,833
You were getting engaged and I saved your life.

1053
01:00:24,333 --> 01:00:25,500
So show some bloody respect.

1054
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,291
Marriage was just around the corner for you.

1055
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:29,500
And the pervert would have been stripping your clothes right now.

1056
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:30,958
Get that?

1057
01:00:31,458 --> 01:00:34,625
I saved you.

1058
01:00:35,125 --> 01:00:39,958
You're so cheap...and I never realized it.

1059
01:00:40,458 --> 01:00:41,791
You've been exposed.

1060
01:00:42,291 --> 01:00:44,583
Few problems and love went out the window.

1061
01:00:45,083 --> 01:00:46,458
You know...Princess.

1062
01:00:46,958 --> 01:00:53,166
These leeches in the jungle are far better than you.

1063
01:00:53,666 --> 01:00:54,791
Few problems?

1064
01:00:55,291 --> 01:00:56,916
If we manage to get out of here alive...

1065
01:00:57,416 --> 01:00:59,375
...I'll show you what problems are.

1066
01:00:59,875 --> 01:01:00,666
You ba*****.

1067
01:01:01,166 --> 01:01:02,166
I swear I'll show you.

1068
01:01:02,666 --> 01:01:05,083
See...you're finally showing your true colors.

1069
01:01:05,583 --> 01:01:07,416
I hope someone puts a bullet in you.

1070
01:01:07,916 --> 01:01:12,750
Die, you bloody brain-dead woman.

1071
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:14,333
You don't worry.

1072
01:01:14,833 --> 01:01:15,500
Have a bone.

1073
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,583
What do you want for breakfast?

1074
01:01:21,083 --> 01:01:24,583
You...

1075
01:01:35,666 --> 01:01:36,791
Leave me!

1076
01:01:37,291 --> 01:01:40,791
Dino!

1077
01:02:09,166 --> 01:02:15,000
"Mawali... qawwali."

1078
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:23,458
"Husband's shy... and wife's rebellious."

1079
01:02:23,958 --> 01:02:29,958
"Mawali... qawwali."

1080
01:02:30,458 --> 01:02:36,875
"Husband's shy... and wife's rebellious."

1081
01:02:37,375 --> 01:02:44,375
"Stunning beauty... curvaceous body."

1082
01:02:44,875 --> 01:02:52,208
"Your eyes...are extremists."

1083
01:02:52,708 --> 01:02:56,291
"I'm the avatar of Romeo, your companion."

1084
01:02:56,791 --> 01:02:59,500
"Come and test me."

1085
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,541
"You've a swift gait. I know you're amazing."

1086
01:03:04,041 --> 01:03:07,375
"But even I'm a hunter."

1087
01:03:07,875 --> 01:03:13,583
"Mawali... qawwali."

1088
01:03:14,083 --> 01:03:21,750
"You're a firecracker... and I am Diwali."

1089
01:03:22,250 --> 01:03:28,125
"Mawali... qawwali."

1090
01:03:28,625 --> 01:03:32,125
"Soft body... and mesmerizing voice."

1091
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:58,500
"O beautiful girl."

1092
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:05,916
"Pierce through my heart, don't be so cruel."

1093
01:04:06,416 --> 01:04:12,291
"Mawali... qawwali."

1094
01:04:12,791 --> 01:04:20,500
"Husband's shy... and wife's rebellious."

1095
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:26,875
"Mawali... qawwali."

1096
01:04:27,375 --> 01:04:30,875
"Husband's shy... and wife's rebellious."

1097
01:05:12,458 --> 01:05:16,583
About time.

1098
01:05:17,083 --> 01:05:19,083
Where's Jerry?

1099
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:20,000
What do you mean where is he?

1100
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:21,333
Wasn't he with you?

1101
01:05:21,833 --> 01:05:23,291
Will I take him along even for this?

1102
01:05:23,791 --> 01:05:25,041
I left first.

1103
01:05:25,541 --> 01:05:28,125
I had to circle around to get here.

1104
01:05:28,625 --> 01:05:30,625
S*** man.

1105
01:05:31,125 --> 01:05:32,583
I won't leave him here.

1106
01:05:33,083 --> 01:05:38,166
Right. Everyone must be waiting to welcome you.

1107
01:05:38,666 --> 01:05:40,833
Hold on, man.

1108
01:05:41,333 --> 01:05:43,416
How will we find him in this jungle?

1109
01:05:43,916 --> 01:05:45,125
Couldn't you check once?

1110
01:05:45,625 --> 01:05:48,375
This is all your fault. - You can think whatever you want.

1111
01:05:48,875 --> 01:05:51,541
Do whatever you like.

1112
01:05:52,041 --> 01:05:54,833
It doesn't make a difference to me.

1113
01:05:55,333 --> 01:05:56,541
Let's go.

1114
01:05:57,041 --> 01:06:00,000
But, Dinesh Nigam, leaving Jerry behind...

1115
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:02,750
...is your biggest mistake.

1116
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:06,750
And I'll never forgive you for that.

1117
01:06:11,375 --> 01:06:14,875
Let's go.

1118
01:06:37,208 --> 01:06:38,916
Stop. Stop. - Stop.

1119
01:06:39,416 --> 01:06:40,541
Sir, I think this is the bus.

1120
01:06:41,041 --> 01:06:44,291
Shall we take a look inside?

1121
01:06:44,791 --> 01:06:46,375
Shall we take it down one by one?

1122
01:06:46,875 --> 01:06:50,333
No, I'll check.

1123
01:06:50,833 --> 01:06:54,583
They're here. - What happened?

1124
01:06:55,083 --> 01:06:56,875
Sir.

1125
01:06:57,375 --> 01:07:00,083
What happened, sir?

1126
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:01,125
Sir...

1127
01:07:01,625 --> 01:07:03,208
Sir... - Sit down. Sit.

1128
01:07:03,708 --> 01:07:05,083
Sir, I am a journalist.

1129
01:07:05,583 --> 01:07:06,666
We've no connections with the Maoists.

1130
01:07:07,166 --> 01:07:11,208
I know all about your journalism, Mr.Dinesh Nigam.

1131
01:07:11,708 --> 01:07:12,500
Yes, Mr. Mahesh.

1132
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,375
We've found her. Speak here.

1133
01:07:16,875 --> 01:07:20,208
Yes, I am with him. - Okay.

1134
01:07:20,708 --> 01:07:22,708
Come. You're coming with me.

1135
01:07:23,208 --> 01:07:25,083
When did you make a call?

1136
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:28,541
What a bloody... - Don't ever show your face again.

1137
01:07:29,041 --> 01:07:30,708
You'll regret it. - Let's go.

1138
01:07:31,208 --> 01:07:32,166
What will you do?

1139
01:07:32,666 --> 01:07:33,291
What can you do?

1140
01:07:33,791 --> 01:07:35,375
Stop him. - Acting smart are you?

1141
01:07:35,875 --> 01:07:37,083
Hold the boy. - I'll see you.

1142
01:07:37,583 --> 01:07:38,416
I'll see you too.

1143
01:07:38,916 --> 01:07:39,583
I won't spare you.

1144
01:07:40,083 --> 01:07:41,416
Come now. - Let's go.

1145
01:07:41,916 --> 01:07:45,416
You bloody...piece of s***.

1146
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:38,166
Big..

1147
01:08:38,666 --> 01:08:41,791
Very big..

1148
01:08:42,291 --> 01:08:45,375
Terrible mistake.

1149
01:08:45,875 --> 01:08:48,375
It's my fault completely.

1150
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:50,541
I'm here now.

1151
01:08:51,041 --> 01:08:52,875
If you want..

1152
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:54,958
Mom.

1153
01:08:55,458 --> 01:08:55,750
It's my fault. - Mom..

1154
01:08:56,250 --> 01:08:56,750
It's my fault.

1155
01:08:57,250 --> 01:08:58,666
Now watch how I rectify it.

1156
01:08:59,166 --> 01:09:00,083
Just watch. - Mom, sorry.

1157
01:09:00,583 --> 01:09:01,458
Watch how I set you straight. - I said sorry.

1158
01:09:01,958 --> 01:09:02,625
Sorry!

1159
01:09:03,125 --> 01:09:05,000
Does your sorry set things right?

1160
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:07,750
Does it wash away our humiliation?

1161
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:13,208
Do you know what you've done you imbecile?

1162
01:09:13,708 --> 01:09:15,166
I've changed, papa.

1163
01:09:15,666 --> 01:09:16,750
Completely.

1164
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:19,083
From within.

1165
01:09:19,583 --> 01:09:20,958
I've finally learnt some sense.

1166
01:09:21,458 --> 01:09:24,958
See for yourself, mom.

1167
01:09:34,208 --> 01:09:37,958
Papa..

1168
01:09:38,458 --> 01:09:41,958
I'll do...whatever you say.

1169
01:09:47,541 --> 01:09:53,958
Heart, mind, useless thoughts...in the dustbin.

1170
01:09:54,458 --> 01:09:57,791
Then you can come in.

1171
01:09:58,291 --> 01:10:01,791
Understood?

1172
01:10:08,833 --> 01:10:11,708
If I had known I'm giving birth to such a girl..

1173
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:13,791
.. then I would've poisoned myself.

1174
01:10:14,291 --> 01:10:15,583
She got married, shameless.

1175
01:10:16,083 --> 01:10:16,541
See, mother.

1176
01:10:17,041 --> 01:10:19,125
She has ruined us, but still there's no remorse on her face.

1177
01:10:19,625 --> 01:10:21,541
Now it's a lifetime of regret.

1178
01:10:22,041 --> 01:10:22,541
Lifetime.

1179
01:10:23,041 --> 01:10:24,916
Mother, control yourself. Control yourself.

1180
01:10:25,416 --> 01:10:26,208
This girl has humiliated us in front of the world.

1181
01:10:26,708 --> 01:10:28,500
Aunt, is Karishma at home?

1182
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:29,916
Please.

1183
01:10:30,416 --> 01:10:32,041
You don't have a friend here anymore.

1184
01:10:32,541 --> 01:10:36,875
You don't have a friend here anymore.

1185
01:10:37,375 --> 01:10:39,500
Why?

1186
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,208
Why did you have to do this?

1187
01:10:41,708 --> 01:10:47,208
I didn't want to be like you, that's why.

1188
01:10:47,708 --> 01:10:51,625
So is this better?

1189
01:10:52,125 --> 01:10:55,500
Both are equally bad.

1190
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,083
Why did you educate me in such a college?

1191
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:02,666
The ambience around, my upbringing was so modern.

1192
01:11:03,166 --> 01:11:05,375
And what after that.

1193
01:11:05,875 --> 01:11:06,250
At the age of 20..

1194
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:08,750
..get married into some Shetty family.

1195
01:11:09,250 --> 01:11:13,875
'Serang, Kumkum, Namaskara.'

1196
01:11:14,375 --> 01:11:17,583
So this was bound to happen.

1197
01:11:18,083 --> 01:11:21,583
You...or me.

1198
01:11:24,333 --> 01:11:30,791
The decision was right, just..

1199
01:11:31,291 --> 01:11:34,791
..the man I trusted was wrong.

1200
01:11:42,625 --> 01:11:47,333
Bro, hand me a painkiller.

1201
01:11:47,833 --> 01:11:51,375
You should've stopped them after few blows.

1202
01:11:51,875 --> 01:11:52,541
I just escaped from a jungle..

1203
01:11:53,041 --> 01:11:55,083
..and am getting beaten up at home.

1204
01:11:55,583 --> 01:11:57,458
I don't believe this.

1205
01:11:57,958 --> 01:12:01,625
Hello. - Hey, Oozy. I am back dude.

1206
01:12:02,125 --> 01:12:05,500
Hello. Hello.

1207
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:06,750
He disconnected the phone.

1208
01:12:07,250 --> 01:12:09,666
Bloody... - Listen, Dino.

1209
01:12:10,166 --> 01:12:11,125
No one's with you anymore..

1210
01:12:11,625 --> 01:12:12,791
..and that includes me.

1211
01:12:13,291 --> 01:12:14,083
Concentrate on your studies.

1212
01:12:14,583 --> 01:12:18,708
You've been suspended from college, not your exams.

1213
01:12:19,208 --> 01:12:22,375
Bloody fool.

1214
01:12:22,875 --> 01:12:25,708
My life's ruined.

1215
01:12:26,208 --> 01:12:26,875
It's all her fault.

1216
01:12:27,375 --> 01:12:29,750
Another evening dedicated to lovers.

1217
01:12:30,250 --> 01:12:31,291
Hi, this is Rose Fonsika..

1218
01:12:31,791 --> 01:12:33,583
..and you're watching midnight magic.

1219
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:36,333
The topic for today's episode is 'Elopement'.

1220
01:12:36,833 --> 01:12:37,500
Which is running away..

1221
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:38,416
Bloody hag..

1222
01:12:38,916 --> 01:12:42,000
Trotting like it's your wedding night.

1223
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:46,000
Shut up.

1224
01:12:48,708 --> 01:12:51,833
Are you being pressurized to break this marriage?

1225
01:12:52,333 --> 01:12:55,625
No, I want to break it off.

1226
01:12:56,125 --> 01:13:04,125
So you didn't know... this boy wasn't 21.

1227
01:13:04,625 --> 01:13:07,041
I didn't. - What's she saying?

1228
01:13:07,541 --> 01:13:09,083
Wait, Dino.

1229
01:13:09,583 --> 01:13:13,083
He's cheated you.

1230
01:13:19,208 --> 01:13:19,541
Yes.

1231
01:13:20,041 --> 01:13:21,250
Cheating. What cheating?

1232
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:24,208
Madam, she decorated candles on the cake on my last birthday.

1233
01:13:24,708 --> 01:13:25,333
We've been studying in the same college..

1234
01:13:25,833 --> 01:13:26,125
..for the last 4 years.

1235
01:13:26,625 --> 01:13:26,875
What cheating?

1236
01:13:27,375 --> 01:13:29,708
Didn't you tell him? - Dinesh, please agree.

1237
01:13:30,208 --> 01:13:33,625
Dinesh. Sit.

1238
01:13:34,125 --> 01:13:39,916
If this girl's lying then this procedure ends here.

1239
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:42,791
This marriage cannot be null and void.

1240
01:13:43,291 --> 01:13:44,666
Come on, go home everyone.

1241
01:13:45,166 --> 01:13:47,500
Madam, the girl's telling the truth.

1242
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,333
She didn't know Dinesh's real age.

1243
01:13:49,833 --> 01:13:53,333
But cheating...no way.

1244
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:01,625
Dinesh Nigam. - Yes, ma'am.

1245
01:14:02,125 --> 01:14:04,416
First of all...are you interested..

1246
01:14:04,916 --> 01:14:07,541
..in breaking this marriage or not? - Yes, of course.

1247
01:14:08,041 --> 01:14:09,541
At any cost I want to get rid of her.

1248
01:14:10,041 --> 01:14:11,958
All the best, don't fail like you always do.

1249
01:14:12,458 --> 01:14:13,125
Oh really, when did I fail in anything?

1250
01:14:13,625 --> 01:14:15,208
I scored three more marks than you did in Socio.

1251
01:14:15,708 --> 01:14:18,541
Hello. That was 1st year BA and I tutored you.

1252
01:14:19,041 --> 01:14:20,000
Listen, you didn't teach me anything.

1253
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:21,416
Duffer. - Listen, I saved your life.

1254
01:14:21,916 --> 01:14:22,250
When?

1255
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:24,250
Is that why you took me in the jungle to die?

1256
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:25,250
Dino.

1257
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:26,041
You shut up. - You shut up.

1258
01:14:26,541 --> 01:14:26,958
Dino, calm down.

1259
01:14:27,458 --> 01:14:28,875
Hey! What happened?

1260
01:14:29,375 --> 01:14:30,000
Is this a classroom?

1261
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:32,208
This isn't a classroom.

1262
01:14:32,708 --> 01:14:36,208
Be quiet!

1263
01:14:37,916 --> 01:14:39,000
Same story.

1264
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:41,458
You know, many couples come to me..

1265
01:14:41,958 --> 01:14:45,458
..with their differences.

1266
01:14:53,541 --> 01:14:56,041
Sign here and wait outside.

1267
01:14:56,541 --> 01:15:00,041
Hurry up.

1268
01:15:11,416 --> 01:15:14,500
How soon can we get this annulment?

1269
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,208
This is a marriage.

1270
01:15:17,708 --> 01:15:20,166
In our culture it's meant for a lifetime.

1271
01:15:20,666 --> 01:15:22,583
It will take some time to annul it.

1272
01:15:23,083 --> 01:15:24,125
No, but approximately how much time?

1273
01:15:24,625 --> 01:15:25,833
Madam..

1274
01:15:26,333 --> 01:15:27,291
It won't take much.. - Next.

1275
01:15:27,791 --> 01:15:31,291
Next!

1276
01:15:36,125 --> 01:15:36,541
She won't come.

1277
01:15:37,041 --> 01:15:39,708
But some day you two will have to come together.

1278
01:15:40,208 --> 01:15:43,291
Without my report the judge won't give you the next date.

1279
01:15:43,791 --> 01:15:45,250
So why don't you just come and sit down.

1280
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:47,625
Come on.

1281
01:15:48,125 --> 01:15:50,125
Yes.

1282
01:15:50,625 --> 01:15:53,333
Hi. - Hi.

1283
01:15:53,833 --> 01:15:54,625
Sit.

1284
01:15:55,125 --> 01:15:57,000
Karishma, I'm waiting downstairs.

1285
01:15:57,500 --> 01:16:00,916
Okay?

1286
01:16:01,416 --> 01:16:04,125
So Ms. Karishma Shetty and Mr. Dinesh Nigam.

1287
01:16:04,625 --> 01:16:04,958
Dino, please

1288
01:16:05,458 --> 01:16:06,500
I don't like Dinesh.

1289
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,208
That's right, he's a cheap man.

1290
01:16:08,708 --> 01:16:08,958
Oh, how clever.

1291
01:16:09,458 --> 01:16:10,291
I was talking about my name you stupid fool.

1292
01:16:10,791 --> 01:16:11,041
Mr. Nigam, can you just calm down please.

1293
01:16:11,541 --> 01:16:11,833
Dumb***..

1294
01:16:12,333 --> 01:16:13,208
Don't abuse me. - Don't abuse me.

1295
01:16:13,708 --> 01:16:14,500
Don't touch me. - Calm down.

1296
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,208
Don't point fingers at me.

1297
01:16:16,708 --> 01:16:16,958
I'll just.. - Calm down.

1298
01:16:17,458 --> 01:16:17,875
Calm down!

1299
01:16:18,375 --> 01:16:20,541
Calm down!

1300
01:16:21,041 --> 01:16:24,250
Calm down.

1301
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:31,125
You two know about each other's flaws, I can see very well.

1302
01:16:31,625 --> 01:16:33,041
But there must be something..

1303
01:16:33,541 --> 01:16:34,708
..that brought you two together.

1304
01:16:35,208 --> 01:16:36,041
Can we.. - Foolishness.

1305
01:16:36,541 --> 01:16:37,291
Stupidity.

1306
01:16:37,791 --> 01:16:38,708
And I realized that only after living together.

1307
01:16:39,208 --> 01:16:40,041
Ms. Karishma, I understand that.

1308
01:16:40,541 --> 01:16:44,875
But...something good must have happened after the marriage.

1309
01:16:45,375 --> 01:16:47,125
Small...adorable moments.

1310
01:16:47,625 --> 01:16:51,916
You know those beautiful... beautiful romantic walks.

1311
01:16:52,416 --> 01:16:54,375
Candle-light dinners.

1312
01:16:54,875 --> 01:16:58,958
The moonlight.. - Small...adorable...sweet..

1313
01:16:59,458 --> 01:17:00,333
Honeymoon walks? - Yes.

1314
01:17:00,833 --> 01:17:01,416
If that had happened..

1315
01:17:01,916 --> 01:17:06,250
..then we wouldn't be here, ma'am.

1316
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:09,583
Jerry was the only thing we shared together.

1317
01:17:10,083 --> 01:17:12,750
Jerry? - My darling puppy.

1318
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:15,833
But he left him in the jungle.

1319
01:17:16,333 --> 01:17:17,791
Can you believe that, ma'am?

1320
01:17:18,291 --> 01:17:20,666
That helpless little thing alone in the jungle.

1321
01:17:21,166 --> 01:17:23,041
All his fault.

1322
01:17:23,541 --> 01:17:25,541
He ruined everything.

1323
01:17:26,041 --> 01:17:27,000
It's too bad.. - Mr. Nigam.

1324
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:28,250
Mr. Nigam, can you please control yourself.

1325
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:30,666
Because she loves dogs more than humans.

1326
01:17:31,166 --> 01:17:31,875
That's why she's been going around..

1327
01:17:32,375 --> 01:17:32,916
..with her father's puppy.

1328
01:17:33,416 --> 01:17:34,208
Don't worry, Karishma.

1329
01:17:34,708 --> 01:17:36,541
You lost Jerry, didn't you? That's too bad. - Don't.

1330
01:17:37,041 --> 01:17:37,458
But you have Mahesh.

1331
01:17:37,958 --> 01:17:38,416
Mahesh. - Stop it.

1332
01:17:38,916 --> 01:17:39,291
Call him sweety.

1333
01:17:39,791 --> 01:17:40,208
Please control.

1334
01:17:40,708 --> 01:17:41,250
Ms. Karishma. - I am warning you.

1335
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:42,000
I am warning you, don't do it.

1336
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:43,875
Mr. Nigam, you're not listening to me.

1337
01:17:44,375 --> 01:17:44,666
Shut up.

1338
01:17:45,166 --> 01:17:45,458
Mahesh! Mahesh!

1339
01:17:45,958 --> 01:17:48,208
Mr. Nigam, Ms. Karishma.

1340
01:17:48,708 --> 01:17:49,416
Mr. Nigam, just stop it.

1341
01:17:49,916 --> 01:17:53,416
Mahesh, that Shetty's pet. - Mr. Nigam, please..

1342
01:17:56,416 --> 01:17:56,958
Again.

1343
01:17:57,458 --> 01:17:59,750
Why you..

1344
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:03,625
Oh, God!

1345
01:18:04,125 --> 01:18:07,916
Oh no.

1346
01:18:08,416 --> 01:18:10,791
Honestly, I didn't have much faith in counseling.

1347
01:18:11,291 --> 01:18:13,541
But I'm feeling so much better now.

1348
01:18:14,041 --> 01:18:15,000
Thank you.

1349
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:18,916
But...I am not.

1350
01:18:19,416 --> 01:18:20,625
If we can prove to that judge..

1351
01:18:21,125 --> 01:18:23,583
..that she's already had problems..

1352
01:18:24,083 --> 01:18:26,375
..then this marriage can be immediately terminated.

1353
01:18:26,875 --> 01:18:29,416
Sir, yes...she's got terrible problems.

1354
01:18:29,916 --> 01:18:31,625
She's a psycho.

1355
01:18:32,125 --> 01:18:35,375
Cribbing, crying, yak-yak...day and night.

1356
01:18:35,875 --> 01:18:37,083
Sir, I did everything for her.

1357
01:18:37,583 --> 01:18:39,791
But no, it all seems useless to her.

1358
01:18:40,291 --> 01:18:41,458
And then she's furious about..

1359
01:18:41,958 --> 01:18:43,250
..why I don't admit my mistake.

1360
01:18:43,750 --> 01:18:46,333
I will if I make a mistake.

1361
01:18:46,833 --> 01:18:48,125
Sir, do you get her attitude?

1362
01:18:48,625 --> 01:18:50,291
Sir, do you get it?

1363
01:18:50,791 --> 01:18:53,750
Dino, if marriages start breaking-off..

1364
01:18:54,250 --> 01:18:55,916
..because of women's attitude..

1365
01:18:56,416 --> 01:18:58,708
..then, there won't be a single left in this world.

1366
01:18:59,208 --> 01:19:00,541
Do you get that?

1367
01:19:01,041 --> 01:19:03,083
He's filing a case against me for a small bruise.

1368
01:19:03,583 --> 01:19:04,708
And what about the fact that..

1369
01:19:05,208 --> 01:19:06,666
..he took me in the jungle to die?

1370
01:19:07,166 --> 01:19:10,333
Oh, so he intentionally put you in danger.

1371
01:19:10,833 --> 01:19:12,541
Right? - That's his problem.

1372
01:19:13,041 --> 01:19:13,541
Doesn't know a thing..

1373
01:19:14,041 --> 01:19:18,958
..but tries to show-off his confidence.

1374
01:19:19,458 --> 01:19:20,958
Sir, note it down.

1375
01:19:21,458 --> 01:19:25,541
Sir, note it down please.

1376
01:19:26,041 --> 01:19:27,083
There isn't a single woman..

1377
01:19:27,583 --> 01:19:30,208
..who doesn't think the same about her husband.

1378
01:19:30,708 --> 01:19:31,541
Tell me.

1379
01:19:32,041 --> 01:19:34,083
Tell me.

1380
01:19:34,583 --> 01:19:35,958
She's filing a counter case on you.

1381
01:19:36,458 --> 01:19:36,916
She has nothing.

1382
01:19:37,416 --> 01:19:39,000
Nothing.

1383
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:40,833
You two met with a bike accident in Goa..

1384
01:19:41,333 --> 01:19:44,583
..and she was badly injured.

1385
01:19:45,083 --> 01:19:48,583
She's blaming you.

1386
01:20:00,083 --> 01:20:01,708
Were you drunk?

1387
01:20:02,208 --> 01:20:04,083
Sir, in Goa one has more chances of..

1388
01:20:04,583 --> 01:20:06,791
..meeting with an accident if you're sober.

1389
01:20:07,291 --> 01:20:08,125
We were driving down a mountain.

1390
01:20:08,625 --> 01:20:10,416
It was dark, so the bike skidded.

1391
01:20:10,916 --> 01:20:11,291
That's all.

1392
01:20:11,791 --> 01:20:13,333
But why did you go up the mountain at night?

1393
01:20:13,833 --> 01:20:15,500
Sir, she wanted to come at 3 am.

1394
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:16,958
Go up the mountain.

1395
01:20:17,458 --> 01:20:18,875
Oh I see! - Yes.

1396
01:20:19,375 --> 01:20:21,416
So it was her idea. - Exactly.

1397
01:20:21,916 --> 01:20:22,500
She wanted to go up there..

1398
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,500
She took me up there and.. - Yes.

1399
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,250
What did she want to do at 3 am?

1400
01:20:27,750 --> 01:20:33,125
She.. - Yes, speak up.

1401
01:20:33,625 --> 01:20:34,875
Sir, please drop the assault charges.

1402
01:20:35,375 --> 01:20:36,750
But why, we've a point.

1403
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:38,541
Sir, the point is... that sooner or later..

1404
01:20:39,041 --> 01:20:41,541
..the marriage is getting annulled.

1405
01:20:42,041 --> 01:20:45,541
Please, let it be. - Okay.

1406
01:20:49,958 --> 01:20:51,833
From the earth to the sky.

1407
01:20:52,333 --> 01:20:55,291
From the maternity ward to the graveyard.

1408
01:20:55,791 --> 01:20:58,875
Even doomsday..

1409
01:20:59,375 --> 01:21:01,666
There's just one thing in the air.

1410
01:21:02,166 --> 01:21:03,833
Just one thing.

1411
01:21:04,333 --> 01:21:09,166
Dino and Karishma's mind-blowing love.

1412
01:21:09,666 --> 01:21:12,375
Wretch.

1413
01:21:12,875 --> 01:21:15,291
No one can stop me from living.

1414
01:21:15,791 --> 01:21:18,833
No one can stop me from loving me. - Yeah, me too.

1415
01:21:19,333 --> 01:21:23,375
I am made for you and you're made for me.

1416
01:21:23,875 --> 01:21:25,750
Only for you. - I love this time..

1417
01:21:26,250 --> 01:21:29,916
..because I love you. - I love you.

1418
01:21:30,416 --> 01:21:32,625
I love you. I love you.

1419
01:21:33,125 --> 01:21:35,583
Sir, he got scared.

1420
01:21:36,083 --> 01:21:38,416
He dropped the case.

1421
01:21:38,916 --> 01:21:40,916
That's not true.

1422
01:21:41,416 --> 01:21:44,416
Sir, doing rounds of the court doesn't suit your status.

1423
01:21:44,916 --> 01:21:45,333
Yes, sir.

1424
01:21:45,833 --> 01:21:47,541
Mahesh will handle the case with me.

1425
01:21:48,041 --> 01:21:51,541
Right, Mahesh?

1426
01:22:08,791 --> 01:22:11,583
It wasn't your fault.

1427
01:22:12,083 --> 01:22:15,000
Get some sleep.

1428
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:17,333
I can't sleep.

1429
01:22:17,833 --> 01:22:21,000
Why?

1430
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:26,458
You won't understand. - Still.

1431
01:22:26,958 --> 01:22:30,458
Try.

1432
01:22:34,333 --> 01:22:40,000
You can't see yourself like the way I see you.

1433
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:44,708
Like the way I'm feeling you...now.

1434
01:22:45,208 --> 01:22:48,708
You can't feel it, can you?

1435
01:22:52,333 --> 01:22:55,833
Are you going to make me cry?

1436
01:23:22,708 --> 01:23:23,666
Okay.

1437
01:23:24,166 --> 01:23:26,666
Both sides have dropped the cases.

1438
01:23:27,166 --> 01:23:29,750
And we'll have to wait for the annulment again.

1439
01:23:30,250 --> 01:23:32,958
Yeah. I'll take your leave.

1440
01:23:33,458 --> 01:23:36,958
Thank you.

1441
01:23:51,750 --> 01:23:53,375
"Separated. Separated."

1442
01:23:53,875 --> 01:23:55,666
"We've separated."

1443
01:23:56,166 --> 01:24:00,208
"But why aren't we completely separated?"

1444
01:24:00,708 --> 01:24:02,291
"Separated. Separated."

1445
01:24:02,791 --> 01:24:04,500
"We've separated by name."

1446
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,666
"But our souls are still connected."

1447
01:24:07,166 --> 01:24:09,000
"So we've separated only for namesake."

1448
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:17,625
"Without you life feels empty."

1449
01:24:18,125 --> 01:24:26,500
"My heart's intact, but I feel there's a void."

1450
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:30,833
"Separated from lane, separated from your city."

1451
01:24:31,333 --> 01:24:35,375
"But our memories still dwell where we situated."

1452
01:24:35,875 --> 01:24:44,041
"Without you life feels empty."

1453
01:24:44,541 --> 01:24:48,041
"My heart's intact, but I feel there's a void."

1454
01:25:15,375 --> 01:25:19,208
"The emptiness pierces through my heart.."

1455
01:25:19,708 --> 01:25:23,208
"..with the rusted dagger of pride."

1456
01:25:23,708 --> 01:25:28,208
"It's like I've lost my slumber."

1457
01:25:28,708 --> 01:25:32,458
"The hands of the clock.."

1458
01:25:32,958 --> 01:25:36,458
"..ticks slower now."

1459
01:25:41,958 --> 01:25:50,583
"Without you life feels empty."

1460
01:25:51,083 --> 01:25:58,916
"My heart's intact, but I feel there's a void."

1461
01:25:59,416 --> 01:26:01,250
"Separated. Separated."

1462
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:03,416
"We've separated."

1463
01:26:03,916 --> 01:26:08,083
"But why aren't we completely separated?"

1464
01:26:08,583 --> 01:26:09,875
"Separated. Separated."

1465
01:26:10,375 --> 01:26:12,125
"We've separated by name."

1466
01:26:12,625 --> 01:26:14,416
"But our souls are still connected."

1467
01:26:14,916 --> 01:26:16,666
"So we've separated only for namesake."

1468
01:26:17,166 --> 01:26:25,416
"Without you life feels empty."

1469
01:26:25,916 --> 01:26:34,208
"My heart's intact, but I feel there's a void."

1470
01:26:34,708 --> 01:26:43,041
"Without you life feels empty."

1471
01:26:43,541 --> 01:26:52,666
"My heart's intact, but I feel there's a void."

1472
01:26:53,166 --> 01:26:56,666
"But I feel there's a void."

1473
01:27:13,916 --> 01:27:15,375
You've started everything again, haven't you?

1474
01:27:15,875 --> 01:27:19,916
Sorry, mom.. - Your limit is 11 pm.

1475
01:27:20,416 --> 01:27:22,958
Don't ever break it again.

1476
01:27:23,458 --> 01:27:23,666
Yes, brother.

1477
01:27:24,166 --> 01:27:27,666
Let's go, mom.

1478
01:27:32,333 --> 01:27:34,458
He hasn't lost his milk-teeth yet..

1479
01:27:34,958 --> 01:27:37,416
..but is getting his marriage annulled.

1480
01:27:37,916 --> 01:27:41,083
Why talk to him about limits?

1481
01:27:41,583 --> 01:27:42,791
So I would notice him following me.

1482
01:27:43,291 --> 01:27:44,250
That would make me really happy.

1483
01:27:44,750 --> 01:27:46,250
I noticed one day, two days..

1484
01:27:46,750 --> 01:27:49,375
I actually don't like boys that follow me.

1485
01:27:49,875 --> 01:27:51,541
I mean I feel they are goons.

1486
01:27:52,041 --> 01:27:52,583
But I wonder why..

1487
01:27:53,083 --> 01:27:55,375
..it felt nice whenever he followed me.

1488
01:27:55,875 --> 01:27:58,875
Hello and welcome to the first episode..

1489
01:27:59,375 --> 01:28:00,791
..of Midnight Magic in this new year.

1490
01:28:01,291 --> 01:28:02,250
This is Rose Fonsika and you are..

1491
01:28:02,750 --> 01:28:06,250
Ms. Fonsika, shut up.

1492
01:28:16,416 --> 01:28:17,375
Math papers.

1493
01:28:17,875 --> 01:28:20,708
He's really crazy.

1494
01:28:21,208 --> 01:28:23,833
With love Ro.. - Oh no.

1495
01:28:24,333 --> 01:28:27,291
Oh no

1496
01:28:27,791 --> 01:28:30,083
Mr. X took complete advantage of the new year's party..

1497
01:28:30,583 --> 01:28:31,916
..by proposing to Miss. Y.

1498
01:28:32,416 --> 01:28:34,208
And Miss. Y says she was so drunk..

1499
01:28:34,708 --> 01:28:38,208
..that she didn't know what she said.

1500
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:51,708
You like Shahrukh Khan or Salman Khan?

1501
01:28:52,208 --> 01:28:54,833
Irfan Khan.

1502
01:28:55,333 --> 01:28:58,833
Hollywood, huh?

1503
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,500
Okay.

1504
01:29:07,208 --> 01:29:08,333
Don't worry, okay.

1505
01:29:08,833 --> 01:29:10,458
Madam, this is the psychiatrist's report.

1506
01:29:10,958 --> 01:29:11,541
And my client's taken her decision..

1507
01:29:12,041 --> 01:29:12,958
..in her complete knowledge.

1508
01:29:13,458 --> 01:29:16,958
Even my client admits his mistake, Your Honor.

1509
01:29:25,375 --> 01:29:29,083
I want the pictures of our trip.

1510
01:29:29,583 --> 01:29:33,333
I deleted those.

1511
01:29:33,833 --> 01:29:36,791
I'm sure you didn't delete Jerry's picture.

1512
01:29:37,291 --> 01:29:40,791
I'll mail them to you.

1513
01:29:42,625 --> 01:29:44,958
I want all of it, in high-res.

1514
01:29:45,458 --> 01:29:47,583
After all even I have a right on those photos.

1515
01:29:48,083 --> 01:29:51,583
Oh really, then file another case on me.

1516
01:29:58,166 --> 01:29:59,541
Thank you. Thank you, madam.

1517
01:30:00,041 --> 01:30:01,750
Karishma.

1518
01:30:02,250 --> 01:30:05,291
Sign here.

1519
01:30:05,791 --> 01:30:08,208
Hold on.

1520
01:30:08,708 --> 01:30:10,500
Changing your mood?

1521
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,500
No chance.

1522
01:30:20,375 --> 01:30:22,125
Make your style fun... at pantaloons.

1523
01:30:22,625 --> 01:30:25,791
I know you must be enjoying Mumbai's winter.

1524
01:30:26,291 --> 01:30:29,083
You can just feel this romance in the air.

1525
01:30:29,583 --> 01:30:32,750
But before I sign off it's time to take one last video call.

1526
01:30:33,250 --> 01:30:35,083
Hey there, welcome to midnight magic.

1527
01:30:35,583 --> 01:30:37,333
Hi, Rose. This is sine Z.

1528
01:30:37,833 --> 01:30:40,708
Oh really, Mr. Math. - Not me.

1529
01:30:41,208 --> 01:30:44,458
Mr. Math is Tan Z who loves Cos Z.

1530
01:30:44,958 --> 01:30:46,666
You reminded me of my college lectures.

1531
01:30:47,166 --> 01:30:48,583
You loved Math. - Not all.

1532
01:30:49,083 --> 01:30:51,250
I managed to pass with the help of a senior.

1533
01:30:51,750 --> 01:30:54,375
But you tell me sine Z, what's this equation here.

1534
01:30:54,875 --> 01:30:55,708
That's exactly what we're missing out on here.

1535
01:30:56,208 --> 01:30:57,708
Tan Z has wasted three years..

1536
01:30:58,208 --> 01:30:59,583
..but he hasn't approached Cos Z yet.

1537
01:31:00,083 --> 01:31:00,583
Wow.

1538
01:31:01,083 --> 01:31:04,541
And he still thinks about her? - Every single day.

1539
01:31:05,041 --> 01:31:08,208
So the question is will Cos Z's hint..

1540
01:31:08,708 --> 01:31:12,291
..become a 'Love Story' or not?

1541
01:31:12,791 --> 01:31:19,375
Oh, it's time to complete this incomplete love story.

1542
01:31:19,875 --> 01:31:23,625
Bloody Dino..

1543
01:31:24,125 --> 01:31:27,208
So...do you have a suggestion?

1544
01:31:27,708 --> 01:31:33,333
Well...I think Cos Z should meet up with Tan Z.

1545
01:31:33,833 --> 01:31:36,291
Wonderful. Wonderful.

1546
01:31:36,791 --> 01:31:40,000
And since both the Z's are watching your show..

1547
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:44,291
..I invite them to Hard Rock Caf this evening.

1548
01:31:44,791 --> 01:31:48,291
Where a new chapter of this 'Love Story' begins.

1549
01:31:48,791 --> 01:31:51,708
Thank you and goodnight, Rose. - Bye.

1550
01:31:52,208 --> 01:31:53,833
You bloody fool.

1551
01:31:54,333 --> 01:31:57,083
Have you lost your mind?

1552
01:31:57,583 --> 01:31:59,916
Why be afraid when you're in love?

1553
01:32:00,416 --> 01:32:02,708
Be brave if you feel something.

1554
01:32:03,208 --> 01:32:06,708
Spread a little chaos.

1555
01:32:12,125 --> 01:32:13,250
Congratulations, sir.

1556
01:32:13,750 --> 01:32:15,666
The judge has finally agreed.

1557
01:32:16,166 --> 01:32:18,208
The annulment papers will be filed soon.

1558
01:32:18,708 --> 01:32:22,125
Any day.

1559
01:32:22,625 --> 01:32:30,500
Is that why you wore a suit? - No, sir.

1560
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:34,583
From any point of view, this is the best.

1561
01:32:35,083 --> 01:32:37,833
But he works for us.

1562
01:32:38,333 --> 01:32:39,875
It won't be the right match.

1563
01:32:40,375 --> 01:32:41,958
He'll be in control.

1564
01:32:42,458 --> 01:32:45,958
And he can look after the business after me.

1565
01:32:54,916 --> 01:32:57,041
You're looking for a suitable match, aren't you?

1566
01:32:57,541 --> 01:32:59,000
So what happened?

1567
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:03,000
Found anyone?

1568
01:33:08,083 --> 01:33:13,291
Father, I want to go shopping. Personal.

1569
01:33:13,791 --> 01:33:15,541
Can I go out for an hour?

1570
01:33:16,041 --> 01:33:19,541
Yes.

1571
01:33:23,083 --> 01:33:24,500
Karishma, I'll send the car as soon as I get to the office.

1572
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,125
Thanks.

1573
01:33:26,625 --> 01:33:30,125
Karishma, 15 minutes.

1574
01:33:47,291 --> 01:33:49,458
Hey. Thanks for coming.

1575
01:33:49,958 --> 01:33:53,750
Here. - Finally.

1576
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:56,666
You know...you take good pictures.

1577
01:33:57,166 --> 01:34:00,750
Consider it as a career option.

1578
01:34:01,250 --> 01:34:03,583
Okay, bye. - I have decided, by the way.

1579
01:34:04,083 --> 01:34:05,458
I've applied as well.

1580
01:34:05,958 --> 01:34:07,291
In Australia and New Zealand.

1581
01:34:07,791 --> 01:34:08,916
Nice.

1582
01:34:09,416 --> 01:34:11,583
And this way you can get out of here.

1583
01:34:12,083 --> 01:34:13,000
I'm planning something similar.

1584
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:15,125
Finish my final year and out.

1585
01:34:15,625 --> 01:34:18,000
And then...we'll see you on music channels.

1586
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:21,625
Actually, I don't know. - What?

1587
01:34:22,125 --> 01:34:25,958
Whether I am passionate about music or not.

1588
01:34:26,458 --> 01:34:29,000
I don't know. - You're joking, right.

1589
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:30,458
Why?

1590
01:34:30,958 --> 01:34:34,416
You were glued to your stupid guitar even in that jungle.

1591
01:34:34,916 --> 01:34:38,125
Is that why you broke it?

1592
01:34:38,625 --> 01:34:41,458
I actually wanted to break your head.

1593
01:34:41,958 --> 01:34:45,458
I wonder how you survived.

1594
01:34:55,041 --> 01:34:58,333
You know...it's all brother's fault. - Really?

1595
01:34:58,833 --> 01:34:59,750
How come?

1596
01:35:00,250 --> 01:35:04,791
He's so good, that I get attention only when I am bad.

1597
01:35:05,291 --> 01:35:07,500
Maybe the guitar is a part of that image.

1598
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,041
I mean it's not that I don't like music.

1599
01:35:10,541 --> 01:35:11,291
Of course I do.

1600
01:35:11,791 --> 01:35:14,666
But if it's taught in class, and made compulsory..

1601
01:35:15,166 --> 01:35:17,208
..will I be able to endure it?

1602
01:35:17,708 --> 01:35:19,500
I will bunk those classes as well.

1603
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,416
Did you come up with all that?

1604
01:35:21,916 --> 01:35:22,875
The bottom line is..

1605
01:35:23,375 --> 01:35:27,500
..you can't set your heart in something you have doubts about.

1606
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,416
Dino, are you starting to make sense?

1607
01:35:29,916 --> 01:35:32,958
Listen, if you act too smart, then I.. - Then..

1608
01:35:33,458 --> 01:35:35,750
I'll do something positive.

1609
01:35:36,250 --> 01:35:36,916
This tattoo.

1610
01:35:37,416 --> 01:35:39,208
In case you want to get it removed, I have a number.

1611
01:35:39,708 --> 01:35:41,833
Laser and all...clean job.

1612
01:35:42,333 --> 01:35:43,750
So why didn't you get yours done?

1613
01:35:44,250 --> 01:35:45,666
I thought at first.

1614
01:35:46,166 --> 01:35:48,000
But it looks cool.

1615
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:50,416
So...you want the number.

1616
01:35:50,916 --> 01:35:53,666
Just so that I don't make a blunder again..

1617
01:35:54,166 --> 01:36:01,916
..I want to be reminded of my biggest mistake.

1618
01:36:02,416 --> 01:36:04,625
Time-up. - Thank God.

1619
01:36:05,125 --> 01:36:06,291
I'm not saying it to drive you away.

1620
01:36:06,791 --> 01:36:09,416
Look, puppy's here to pick you up.

1621
01:36:09,916 --> 01:36:11,708
S**t. What if he sees you?

1622
01:36:12,208 --> 01:36:13,291
I am not scared of that rascal.

1623
01:36:13,791 --> 01:36:15,000
Please, just come here. - Why?

1624
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:15,875
This way.

1625
01:36:16,375 --> 01:36:17,583
Where are you taking? - Come on, Dino.

1626
01:36:18,083 --> 01:36:18,416
What are you doing?

1627
01:36:18,916 --> 01:36:19,458
Just follow me. - Just leave me.

1628
01:36:19,958 --> 01:36:20,250
Excuse me.

1629
01:36:20,750 --> 01:36:23,666
He might see you. - Let go.

1630
01:36:24,166 --> 01:36:25,083
Please, just stay here for a while.

1631
01:36:25,583 --> 01:36:26,916
You can show that attitude to someone else.

1632
01:36:27,416 --> 01:36:28,333
What is your problem?

1633
01:36:28,833 --> 01:36:32,250
Just shut up.

1634
01:36:32,750 --> 01:36:33,541
What are you doing?

1635
01:36:34,041 --> 01:36:34,625
Karishma.

1636
01:36:35,125 --> 01:36:36,666
Just move aside.

1637
01:36:37,166 --> 01:36:37,750
Please.

1638
01:36:38,250 --> 01:36:40,416
Karishma.

1639
01:36:40,916 --> 01:36:43,375
Mahesh.

1640
01:36:43,875 --> 01:36:47,375
Hello.

1641
01:36:55,041 --> 01:36:58,458
Karishma. - Hey, what are you doing?

1642
01:36:58,958 --> 01:37:00,291
Cheap, idiot. - Karishma.

1643
01:37:00,791 --> 01:37:02,291
Hey.

1644
01:37:02,791 --> 01:37:06,291
S**t.

1645
01:37:08,583 --> 01:37:12,083
Karishma.

1646
01:37:20,750 --> 01:37:24,250
What happened?

1647
01:38:11,583 --> 01:38:15,083
Blunder.com.

1648
01:38:16,875 --> 01:38:20,375
Bring it on.

1649
01:38:23,958 --> 01:38:24,375
What happened?

1650
01:38:24,875 --> 01:38:25,750
You're getting beaten up.

1651
01:38:26,250 --> 01:38:26,583
Drink some water.

1652
01:38:27,083 --> 01:38:30,583
Really, I'll show you in the next match.

1653
01:38:33,791 --> 01:38:38,583
So Karishma's totally wiped out from your heart?

1654
01:38:39,083 --> 01:38:40,000
Sure?

1655
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:44,000
Annulment. What more do you want?

1656
01:38:50,333 --> 01:38:55,958
Actually...I am bit of a rascal. - I know.

1657
01:38:56,458 --> 01:38:58,833
You don't know.

1658
01:38:59,333 --> 01:39:00,875
What?

1659
01:39:01,375 --> 01:39:03,500
Karishma.

1660
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,500
Meaning?

1661
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:12,041
When people used to link you with Karishma..

1662
01:39:12,541 --> 01:39:16,041
..it would make me really jealous.

1663
01:39:21,083 --> 01:39:22,666
K...

1664
01:39:23,166 --> 01:39:26,666
Karishma?

1665
01:39:28,458 --> 01:39:29,500
Dino, I am so sorry.

1666
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:30,916
You have no idea how guilty I am about this.

1667
01:39:31,416 --> 01:39:33,125
Listen to what I have to say. - Rascal.

1668
01:39:33,625 --> 01:39:34,083
Should've told me before..

1669
01:39:34,583 --> 01:39:37,750
..and we could've all eloped together.

1670
01:39:38,250 --> 01:39:40,500
Would've been real fun, idiot.

1671
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:41,958
Ba***.

1672
01:39:42,458 --> 01:39:43,333
You scared me.

1673
01:39:43,833 --> 01:39:46,916
Got you? Got you?

1674
01:39:47,416 --> 01:39:50,666
Swear. I was really furious.

1675
01:39:51,166 --> 01:39:52,750
My friend hid his affair.

1676
01:39:53,250 --> 01:39:55,500
The girl eloped.

1677
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,416
And that's why I realized, you know.

1678
01:39:58,916 --> 01:40:01,333
It's so bloody obvious that you two are made for each other.

1679
01:40:01,833 --> 01:40:03,333
That's what we thought.

1680
01:40:03,833 --> 01:40:04,500
Anyways, listen.

1681
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:06,708
Lines are soon opening up.

1682
01:40:07,208 --> 01:40:08,625
Start calling. - Rubbish.

1683
01:40:09,125 --> 01:40:13,375
Who's going to be Karishma's hubby...part 2.

1684
01:40:13,875 --> 01:40:16,375
Start calling.

1685
01:40:16,875 --> 01:40:20,500
So you don't know. - What?

1686
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:21,291
What?

1687
01:40:21,791 --> 01:40:22,625
Push. Up.

1688
01:40:23,125 --> 01:40:25,125
Come on. Faster. Faster.

1689
01:40:25,625 --> 01:40:26,083
Come on. Come on.

1690
01:40:26,583 --> 01:40:27,750
Over there. Stretch your back.

1691
01:40:28,250 --> 01:40:28,791
Come on, faster.

1692
01:40:29,291 --> 01:40:29,916
Mahesh!

1693
01:40:30,416 --> 01:40:32,958
Mahesh, huh!

1694
01:40:33,458 --> 01:40:34,625
Are you serious? Mahesh?

1695
01:40:35,125 --> 01:40:37,125
Calling him a puppy is insulting Jerry.

1696
01:40:37,625 --> 01:40:39,125
Have you stooped that low?

1697
01:40:39,625 --> 01:40:41,500
What difference does it make to you?

1698
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,291
Not me...him.

1699
01:40:43,791 --> 01:40:44,208
Dino, no...

1700
01:40:44,708 --> 01:40:47,000
He's had a crush on you for years.

1701
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:47,916
Oozy, what..

1702
01:40:48,416 --> 01:40:50,041
What can you expect from someone..

1703
01:40:50,541 --> 01:40:52,375
..whose role model is your father?

1704
01:40:52,875 --> 01:40:55,125
Listen, you'll be better off with Oozy, okay.

1705
01:40:55,625 --> 01:40:56,333
Dino, shut up. - You listen to me, okay.

1706
01:40:56,833 --> 01:40:57,291
You've no idea what you're saying.

1707
01:40:57,791 --> 01:41:01,458
I know what's good or bad for me.

1708
01:41:01,958 --> 01:41:04,041
Get it?

1709
01:41:04,541 --> 01:41:06,416
Oozy, I am not saying that you're wrong. - I know.

1710
01:41:06,916 --> 01:41:07,750
I understand.

1711
01:41:08,250 --> 01:41:09,791
You can't survive even for three weeks with Mahesh..

1712
01:41:10,291 --> 01:41:11,375
..like you did with me.

1713
01:41:11,875 --> 01:41:14,458
From head to toe you will be covered in tattoo.

1714
01:41:14,958 --> 01:41:18,083
First of all, Mahesh isn't my decision.

1715
01:41:18,583 --> 01:41:25,291
And secondly, if you have a problem with this decision even better.

1716
01:41:25,791 --> 01:41:26,208
K.. - Problem?

1717
01:41:26,708 --> 01:41:27,750
Calm down, why are you doing this?

1718
01:41:28,250 --> 01:41:29,083
I am laughing.

1719
01:41:29,583 --> 01:41:30,541
This is so funny.

1720
01:41:31,041 --> 01:41:31,958
I feel so pity for you.

1721
01:41:32,458 --> 01:41:33,916
You're so funny.

1722
01:41:34,416 --> 01:41:36,500
You're such a loser.

1723
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:38,500
You can't stop laughing even after getting humiliated.

1724
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:39,875
At least I am not marrying my maid.

1725
01:41:40,375 --> 01:41:40,916
Don't call him maid, okay.

1726
01:41:41,416 --> 01:41:44,625
Be quiet. - Shut up both of you.

1727
01:41:45,125 --> 01:41:46,750
Quiet.

1728
01:41:47,250 --> 01:41:49,125
Both of you, shut up.

1729
01:41:49,625 --> 01:41:50,458
Back in college everyone thought..

1730
01:41:50,958 --> 01:41:54,625
..you two were having an affair, and you two didn't know.

1731
01:41:55,125 --> 01:41:55,583
Remember?

1732
01:41:56,083 --> 01:41:58,791
Yeah. - So.

1733
01:41:59,291 --> 01:42:03,375
It's still the same with you two, can't you guys see this?

1734
01:42:03,875 --> 01:42:07,375
Fools you guys are. Just blind.

1735
01:42:09,625 --> 01:42:12,625
He's nuts. - Seriously.

1736
01:42:13,125 --> 01:42:15,583
Mental. - Speaks rubbish.

1737
01:42:16,083 --> 01:42:19,416
Yeah.

1738
01:42:19,916 --> 01:42:21,750
So..

1739
01:42:22,250 --> 01:42:25,208
I.. - Yeah.

1740
01:42:25,708 --> 01:42:29,208
Yeah.

1741
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:36,958
Cheers, guys.

1742
01:42:37,458 --> 01:42:39,541
Bro, relax. She will be here.

1743
01:42:40,041 --> 01:42:41,041
Don't be tensed.

1744
01:42:41,541 --> 01:42:41,916
That's exactly what I am worried about.

1745
01:42:42,416 --> 01:42:43,208
What if she does come?

1746
01:42:43,708 --> 01:42:45,958
First, get rid of the lemon juice.

1747
01:42:46,458 --> 01:42:48,541
Drink some rum, get rid of your stress.

1748
01:42:49,041 --> 01:42:49,916
Brother...

1749
01:42:50,416 --> 01:42:51,791
What will I say to her?

1750
01:42:52,291 --> 01:42:53,666
Dino, I wonder what she must be thinking about me?

1751
01:42:54,166 --> 01:42:55,500
Chill..

1752
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:00,333
If she doesn't turn up.. - She's right here.

1753
01:43:00,833 --> 01:43:03,666
Hi, Dev.

1754
01:43:04,166 --> 01:43:05,083
Hi, Rose.

1755
01:43:05,583 --> 01:43:07,208
Are you joining us?

1756
01:43:07,708 --> 01:43:10,250
I mean...please join us.

1757
01:43:10,750 --> 01:43:13,041
Feeling great.. How are you?

1758
01:43:13,541 --> 01:43:14,416
I am doing fine. - Fine.

1759
01:43:14,916 --> 01:43:16,791
And I am little bro, aka Dino. - Hi.

1760
01:43:17,291 --> 01:43:17,625
My brother.

1761
01:43:18,125 --> 01:43:19,541
And your table's right there. - Alright.

1762
01:43:20,041 --> 01:43:20,458
Come. - Thanks.

1763
01:43:20,958 --> 01:43:21,500
Come.

1764
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,791
Actually, I've got to go, I am working.

1765
01:43:24,291 --> 01:43:25,666
You guys enjoy, cheers.

1766
01:43:26,166 --> 01:43:27,500
Sine Z. - Yes.

1767
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,708
Thanks for calling in.

1768
01:43:30,208 --> 01:43:32,583
Enjoy your evening.

1769
01:43:33,083 --> 01:43:35,500
He plays...guitar over here.

1770
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:36,791
So.. - So..

1771
01:43:37,291 --> 01:43:40,666
Long time. - Yeah, very long in fact.

1772
01:43:41,166 --> 01:43:43,125
Just been traveling.

1773
01:43:43,625 --> 01:43:44,416
My job and all.

1774
01:43:44,916 --> 01:43:45,208
Please sit.

1775
01:43:45,708 --> 01:43:46,708
Yeah, I heard that you've been working hard..

1776
01:43:47,208 --> 01:43:49,333
..and doing quite well in fact.

1777
01:43:49,833 --> 01:43:53,791
Comfortable? - Yeah, please sit.

1778
01:43:54,291 --> 01:43:55,500
So, Dev, what was so important..

1779
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:59,500
..that you took some time off three years later?

1780
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:00,791
Taxi..

1781
01:44:01,291 --> 01:44:02,250
Sorry. Sorry.

1782
01:44:02,750 --> 01:44:04,208
Waiter.

1783
01:44:04,708 --> 01:44:06,750
So you'll.. Drink something?

1784
01:44:07,250 --> 01:44:07,875
Pizza?

1785
01:44:08,375 --> 01:44:11,875
Yeah. I think we'll eat a pizza, Dev.

1786
01:44:34,625 --> 01:44:38,125
Karishma. Hi.

1787
01:44:41,041 --> 01:44:44,916
How are you? - I've been informed.

1788
01:44:45,416 --> 01:44:49,958
Yes, I know.

1789
01:44:50,458 --> 01:44:55,958
So you must know... that this isn't my decision.

1790
01:44:56,458 --> 01:45:00,125
But there's nothing I can do.

1791
01:45:00,625 --> 01:45:02,750
So congratulations, Mahesh.

1792
01:45:03,250 --> 01:45:05,750
Actually I came to congratulate you.

1793
01:45:06,250 --> 01:45:06,833
Really?

1794
01:45:07,333 --> 01:45:09,833
I just received an acceptance letter from a college.

1795
01:45:10,333 --> 01:45:14,291
Unitech, New Zealand.

1796
01:45:14,791 --> 01:45:16,291
Karishma, you can do anything you like..

1797
01:45:16,791 --> 01:45:18,375
..after the marriage.

1798
01:45:18,875 --> 01:45:21,791
No objections from my end.

1799
01:45:22,291 --> 01:45:25,791
Okay?

1800
01:45:40,291 --> 01:45:44,125
You're just wasting your time.

1801
01:45:44,625 --> 01:45:45,083
She's here.

1802
01:45:45,583 --> 01:45:47,750
Where's Mahesh? Upstairs or somewhere.

1803
01:45:48,250 --> 01:45:50,916
See ya. - Bye.

1804
01:45:51,416 --> 01:45:52,166
Try coming. - Yeah.

1805
01:45:52,666 --> 01:45:56,166
Bye. - Bye.

1806
01:45:59,458 --> 01:46:02,125
What are you doing?

1807
01:46:02,625 --> 01:46:05,708
Don't get down, someone might see you.

1808
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:06,791
What happened?

1809
01:46:07,291 --> 01:46:10,791
There's something I wanted to say. - What?

1810
01:46:14,916 --> 01:46:17,208
Don't mind, it's 'Holi'. - You freak.

1811
01:46:17,708 --> 01:46:18,583
Go. Go hide in your room.

1812
01:46:19,083 --> 01:46:20,458
Go, go, go. - You bloody idiot.

1813
01:46:20,958 --> 01:46:21,916
Drive quickly.

1814
01:46:22,416 --> 01:46:24,291
She will definitely come now.

1815
01:46:24,791 --> 01:46:25,583
Yes, sir. Of course.

1816
01:46:26,083 --> 01:46:28,791
I just..

1817
01:46:29,291 --> 01:46:30,541
Get the car.

1818
01:46:31,041 --> 01:46:32,625
Yes, Karishma.

1819
01:46:33,125 --> 01:46:36,583
"The drums and beating and the trumpets are playing."

1820
01:46:37,083 --> 01:46:40,583
"Everyone's drenched in the colors of Holi."

1821
01:46:44,625 --> 01:46:46,416
Karishma.

1822
01:46:46,916 --> 01:46:48,500
I am so happy you came.

1823
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:49,708
Where is he?

1824
01:46:50,208 --> 01:46:50,708
Where is he?

1825
01:46:51,208 --> 01:46:51,833
Hey, K.

1826
01:46:52,333 --> 01:46:54,125
Finally we're together after such a long time.

1827
01:46:54,625 --> 01:46:56,750
So forget everything and let's have fun.

1828
01:46:57,250 --> 01:46:58,916
Come on. - But..

1829
01:46:59,416 --> 01:47:02,000
Come on.

1830
01:47:02,500 --> 01:47:05,500
Mahesh. Coming straight from the dry-cleaners?

1831
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,916
I don't like all this. - Fine, but come have this.

1832
01:47:09,416 --> 01:47:11,333
No. - Mahesh.

1833
01:47:11,833 --> 01:47:12,500
First time you're partying with us..

1834
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:13,666
..won't you have a drink?

1835
01:47:14,166 --> 01:47:17,166
It's not intoxicating, is it? - No.

1836
01:47:17,666 --> 01:47:21,250
Have. Have.

1837
01:47:21,750 --> 01:47:23,375
Nice, huh! - Thanks.

1838
01:47:23,875 --> 01:47:24,708
Cheers.

1839
01:47:25,208 --> 01:47:27,083
"The sky's dressed like a groom."

1840
01:47:27,583 --> 01:47:32,166
"And the earth's dressed like a bride."

1841
01:47:32,666 --> 01:47:34,416
"This day is mine."

1842
01:47:34,916 --> 01:47:38,291
"This day is mine."

1843
01:47:38,791 --> 01:47:40,375
"This day is mine."

1844
01:47:40,875 --> 01:47:42,166
Catch him.

1845
01:47:42,666 --> 01:47:45,541
Catch him. Catch him.

1846
01:47:46,041 --> 01:47:48,083
Hold his hands.

1847
01:47:48,583 --> 01:47:49,250
K.

1848
01:47:49,750 --> 01:47:51,083
K, come on go for it.

1849
01:47:51,583 --> 01:47:54,625
"The drums and beating and the trumpets are playing."

1850
01:47:55,125 --> 01:47:58,625
"Everyone's drenched in the colors of Holi."

1851
01:47:59,125 --> 01:48:02,750
"The drums and beating and the trumpets are playing."

1852
01:48:03,250 --> 01:48:06,625
"This day is mine."

1853
01:48:07,125 --> 01:48:10,708
"This day is mine."

1854
01:48:11,208 --> 01:48:11,708
This..

1855
01:48:12,208 --> 01:48:12,500
This is it, K.

1856
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:14,208
This is you.

1857
01:48:14,708 --> 01:48:17,000
You're not like what your father says.

1858
01:48:17,500 --> 01:48:18,166
You're someone who screams..

1859
01:48:18,666 --> 01:48:20,416
..from the top of the mountain at midnight.

1860
01:48:20,916 --> 01:48:23,166
Listen, K, your life isn't over.

1861
01:48:23,666 --> 01:48:24,416
It's starting now.

1862
01:48:24,916 --> 01:48:28,416
Get it?

1863
01:48:41,625 --> 01:48:43,791
No one can touch me.

1864
01:48:44,291 --> 01:48:46,250
No one!

1865
01:48:46,750 --> 01:48:50,250
No one!

1866
01:48:52,291 --> 01:48:53,291
No one.

1867
01:48:53,791 --> 01:48:54,041
What happened?

1868
01:48:54,541 --> 01:48:55,541
What's wrong with him?

1869
01:48:56,041 --> 01:48:59,458
Mahesh drank cannabis mistaking it for sherbet.

1870
01:48:59,958 --> 01:49:03,458
What?

1871
01:49:23,208 --> 01:49:27,500
"I can't figure out."

1872
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:32,375
"Why you're like this?"

1873
01:49:32,875 --> 01:49:37,083
"You're mine."

1874
01:49:37,583 --> 01:49:44,625
"You're only mine."

1875
01:49:45,125 --> 01:49:47,083
It's been a long time now.

1876
01:49:47,583 --> 01:49:55,041
So I'm presuming that your anger has cooled off.

1877
01:49:55,541 --> 01:49:59,041
That's fantastic.

1878
01:50:00,625 --> 01:50:02,291
So let me begin.

1879
01:50:02,791 --> 01:50:05,666
You know, for keeping a marriage intact..

1880
01:50:06,166 --> 01:50:08,416
..it is important for both to be calm.

1881
01:50:08,916 --> 01:50:11,875
Adjustment, compromise..

1882
01:50:12,375 --> 01:50:14,458
..are two important aspects of marriage.

1883
01:50:14,958 --> 01:50:15,500
You know.. - Very nice.

1884
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:16,875
Very true.

1885
01:50:17,375 --> 01:50:19,291
You speak so well, ma'am.

1886
01:50:19,791 --> 01:50:22,375
Just don't ask any questions. - Why?

1887
01:50:22,875 --> 01:50:25,666
Don't ask, it's dangerous.

1888
01:50:26,166 --> 01:50:28,458
No, I didn't understand. - Okay.

1889
01:50:28,958 --> 01:50:31,791
Look, you'll ask questions and we'll give answers.

1890
01:50:32,291 --> 01:50:33,583
If we start answering then we'll start arguing again.

1891
01:50:34,083 --> 01:50:34,458
Argument?

1892
01:50:34,958 --> 01:50:36,125
And then the same water jug and my head.

1893
01:50:36,625 --> 01:50:37,750
No, no, ma'am. - No, no, Mr. Nigam.

1894
01:50:38,250 --> 01:50:39,000
I mean, Dino.

1895
01:50:39,500 --> 01:50:40,500
I've moved the water jug.

1896
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,416
See, no jug, no water. - Superb.

1897
01:50:43,916 --> 01:50:45,500
Then revengetime.com

1898
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,333
Excuse me.

1899
01:50:48,833 --> 01:50:50,416
Dino.. - Mr. Nigam.

1900
01:50:50,916 --> 01:50:51,250
What's going on?

1901
01:50:51,750 --> 01:50:53,166
Stop.

1902
01:50:53,666 --> 01:50:54,875
Bloody idiot.

1903
01:50:55,375 --> 01:50:56,958
What the hell?

1904
01:50:57,458 --> 01:51:00,500
Can't believe this.

1905
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:02,000
Mean. That was really mean.

1906
01:51:02,500 --> 01:51:03,666
You have to admit that was fun.

1907
01:51:04,166 --> 01:51:04,458
You know what..

1908
01:51:04,958 --> 01:51:06,833
..Mahesh must be still waiting for me in the car.

1909
01:51:07,333 --> 01:51:09,000
Poor guy's putting in all his efforts.

1910
01:51:09,500 --> 01:51:12,583
My wife's future husband.

1911
01:51:13,083 --> 01:51:16,583
Dear husband.

1912
01:51:17,500 --> 01:51:19,708
Actually, K. there's something important..

1913
01:51:20,208 --> 01:51:22,083
..I wanted to say to you.

1914
01:51:22,583 --> 01:51:23,500
About the blunder.

1915
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,333
Shall I say it? - Yes.

1916
01:51:26,833 --> 01:51:31,750
And anyway, there's nothing left to feel bad, so..

1917
01:51:32,250 --> 01:51:33,666
If..

1918
01:51:34,166 --> 01:51:34,875
You know me..

1919
01:51:35,375 --> 01:51:39,916
I mean...you and me.

1920
01:51:40,416 --> 01:51:42,916
What?

1921
01:51:43,416 --> 01:51:45,416
If I say something after I am drunk..

1922
01:51:45,916 --> 01:51:47,083
..then it will definitely be blunder.com

1923
01:51:47,583 --> 01:51:48,958
S**t.

1924
01:51:49,458 --> 01:51:50,875
All the problems started from this place, didn't it?

1925
01:51:51,375 --> 01:51:52,291
Exactly.

1926
01:51:52,791 --> 01:51:53,875
S**t. - But..

1927
01:51:54,375 --> 01:51:57,541
But I had one regret. - What?

1928
01:51:58,041 --> 01:52:01,333
We went through all those troubles.

1929
01:52:01,833 --> 01:52:03,375
Earth-shattering fiasco.

1930
01:52:03,875 --> 01:52:06,125
Epic fail.

1931
01:52:06,625 --> 01:52:11,750
But we didn't get our wedding night.

1932
01:52:12,250 --> 01:52:12,916
Cutie.

1933
01:52:13,416 --> 01:52:16,750
Completely emotional.

1934
01:52:17,250 --> 01:52:20,750
Can I say something?

1935
01:52:23,791 --> 01:52:29,208
I am still your wife, if you want you can try..

1936
01:52:29,708 --> 01:52:31,875
Really?

1937
01:52:32,375 --> 01:52:35,875
Now?

1938
01:52:40,458 --> 01:52:41,583
Oh, God.

1939
01:52:42,083 --> 01:52:43,791
There's nothing we didn't do.

1940
01:52:44,291 --> 01:52:46,291
Dumb and dumber part 3.

1941
01:52:46,791 --> 01:52:49,208
What were we thinking? - I swear.

1942
01:52:49,708 --> 01:52:50,833
And what are we thinking right now?

1943
01:52:51,333 --> 01:52:52,250
Like this way.

1944
01:52:52,750 --> 01:52:56,708
What am I doing here...with you.

1945
01:52:57,208 --> 01:53:00,708
Again!

1946
01:53:11,083 --> 01:53:12,500
K.

1947
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:14,458
K.

1948
01:53:14,958 --> 01:53:18,458
Why?

1949
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,041
Keep this.

1950
01:53:22,541 --> 01:53:23,500
K.

1951
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:24,416
K.

1952
01:53:24,916 --> 01:53:25,333
Karishma.

1953
01:53:25,833 --> 01:53:26,666
K, where are you going?

1954
01:53:27,166 --> 01:53:27,708
Listen.

1955
01:53:28,208 --> 01:53:29,125
K, listen to me.

1956
01:53:29,625 --> 01:53:31,208
Karishma, take it easy.

1957
01:53:31,708 --> 01:53:32,333
Why?

1958
01:53:32,833 --> 01:53:34,000
What's the point of all this?

1959
01:53:34,500 --> 01:53:35,375
We're starting the same circle again..

1960
01:53:35,875 --> 01:53:38,625
..and what comes next?

1961
01:53:39,125 --> 01:53:43,875
I can't handle any more pain.

1962
01:53:44,375 --> 01:53:45,791
Karishma, I am sorry.

1963
01:53:46,291 --> 01:53:50,250
I am really sorry.

1964
01:53:50,750 --> 01:53:56,916
For what I did and whatever happened with you.

1965
01:53:57,416 --> 01:53:59,500
I am really sorry.

1966
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,875
See...just see this.

1967
01:54:03,375 --> 01:54:06,541
We're so engrossed with each other.

1968
01:54:07,041 --> 01:54:12,708
We're in each other's mind.

1969
01:54:13,208 --> 01:54:17,875
I don't want any more confusion.

1970
01:54:18,375 --> 01:54:21,875
I cannot kill myself anymore.

1971
01:54:30,333 --> 01:54:31,958
What would Heera always sing?

1972
01:54:32,458 --> 01:54:35,458
About forsaking attachments?

1973
01:54:35,958 --> 01:54:37,500
What?

1974
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:41,541
It's very simple, K.

1975
01:54:42,041 --> 01:54:45,916
I'll never cross your path again.

1976
01:54:46,416 --> 01:54:52,916
I set you free. Okay.

1977
01:54:53,416 --> 01:54:58,708
There, problem solved.

1978
01:54:59,208 --> 01:55:04,625
But all I want is that you do what you want.

1979
01:55:05,125 --> 01:55:08,750
And stay what you are.

1980
01:55:09,250 --> 01:55:12,750
Okay.

1981
01:55:13,250 --> 01:55:16,750
Goodbye, Princess.

1982
01:55:36,500 --> 01:55:42,708
"The heart's so innocent."

1983
01:55:43,208 --> 01:55:49,958
"But it's surely a rebel."

1984
01:55:50,458 --> 01:55:53,500
"It knows how to burn."

1985
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:57,375
"But not how to cool down."

1986
01:55:57,875 --> 01:56:04,333
"It's just stubborn."

1987
01:56:04,833 --> 01:56:08,333
"It's the limit of stubbornness."

1988
01:56:15,958 --> 01:56:22,291
"The heart's so innocent."

1989
01:56:22,791 --> 01:56:29,375
"But it's surely a rebel."

1990
01:56:29,875 --> 01:56:33,125
"It knows how to burn."

1991
01:56:33,625 --> 01:56:36,666
"But not how to cool down."

1992
01:56:37,166 --> 01:56:43,750
"It's a sweet stubbornness."

1993
01:56:44,250 --> 01:56:51,166
"It's the limit of stubbornness."

1994
01:56:51,666 --> 01:56:58,291
"Why is the heart speechless?"

1995
01:56:58,791 --> 01:57:05,375
"But I'm also proud of it."

1996
01:57:05,875 --> 01:57:08,958
"It knows how to sever ties."

1997
01:57:09,458 --> 01:57:13,125
"But not to tie bonds."

1998
01:57:13,625 --> 01:57:19,750
"It's a sweet stubbornness."

1999
01:57:20,250 --> 01:57:23,750
"It's the limit of stubbornness."

2000
01:58:07,666 --> 01:58:13,000
With one sign...you're marriage will be annulled.

2001
01:58:13,500 --> 01:58:17,583
Let me remind you, there's still time.. - Fine, fine.

2002
01:58:18,083 --> 01:58:18,916
Thank you.

2003
01:58:19,416 --> 01:58:21,041
Let's get on with it.

2004
01:58:21,541 --> 01:58:25,041
Sir, hold on.

2005
01:58:27,541 --> 01:58:30,708
Mr. Dinesh Pradeep Nigam.

2006
01:58:31,208 --> 01:58:34,708
Dinesh. Come.

2007
01:58:45,833 --> 01:58:49,333
Mr. Dinesh, you've to wait.

2008
01:58:55,666 --> 01:59:00,666
We'll need your sign besides it.

2009
01:59:01,166 --> 01:59:03,708
Ms. Karishma.

2010
01:59:04,208 --> 01:59:07,333
Get up. Sign it.

2011
01:59:07,833 --> 01:59:11,333
Karishma.

2012
01:59:18,708 --> 01:59:20,166
Get it checked.

2013
01:59:20,666 --> 01:59:23,916
Dinesh.

2014
01:59:24,416 --> 01:59:27,000
Dinesh.

2015
01:59:27,500 --> 01:59:31,000
It's all okay, it's fine.

2016
01:59:43,291 --> 01:59:49,083
"Separated from the branch of flowers."

2017
01:59:49,583 --> 01:59:57,541
"Scattered on the ground in the month of fall."

2018
01:59:58,041 --> 02:00:03,416
"Swimming in the sea of fire.."

2019
02:00:03,916 --> 02:00:12,000
"..hoping to find dewdrops."

2020
02:00:12,500 --> 02:00:15,833
"The more I try to gather it."

2021
02:00:16,333 --> 02:00:19,458
"The more it slips through my hands."

2022
02:00:19,958 --> 02:00:23,458
"Scatters more than it garners."

2023
02:00:33,541 --> 02:00:38,166
"The heart's unbridled."

2024
02:00:38,666 --> 02:00:45,375
"It's a slave to itself just as much."

2025
02:00:45,875 --> 02:00:50,500
"It knows how to die."

2026
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:54,291
"Never learns to be scared."

2027
02:00:54,791 --> 02:01:01,375
"It's a sweet stubbornness."

2028
02:01:01,875 --> 02:01:08,458
"It's the limit of stubbornness."

2029
02:01:08,958 --> 02:01:12,458
"It's the limit of stubbornness."

2030
02:01:39,583 --> 02:01:40,375
Stop. Stop.

2031
02:01:40,875 --> 02:01:42,541
Stop the car.

2032
02:01:43,041 --> 02:01:44,416
Dino.

2033
02:01:44,916 --> 02:01:48,416
What happened?

2034
02:01:49,916 --> 02:01:53,708
Thank God.

2035
02:01:54,208 --> 02:01:55,041
Dino.

2036
02:01:55,541 --> 02:01:58,625
Dino. We're getting late.

2037
02:01:59,125 --> 02:02:01,541
Poor thing looks lost.

2038
02:02:02,041 --> 02:02:03,833
What if someone runs over him?

2039
02:02:04,333 --> 02:02:06,791
Keep him on the side and let's go.

2040
02:02:07,291 --> 02:02:07,708
Let's go.

2041
02:02:08,208 --> 02:02:09,541
And orphan it again.

2042
02:02:10,041 --> 02:02:12,000
I don't believe this.

2043
02:02:12,500 --> 02:02:15,000
Will you take him along to London?

2044
02:02:15,500 --> 02:02:17,791
Obviously not.

2045
02:02:18,291 --> 02:02:19,541
Dino, what's wrong with you?

2046
02:02:20,041 --> 02:02:22,041
It's almost time for the flight. What are you doing?

2047
02:02:22,541 --> 02:02:26,541
Exactly. What am I doing?

2048
02:02:27,041 --> 02:02:30,541
What?

2049
02:02:52,416 --> 02:02:54,125
Hey.

2050
02:02:54,625 --> 02:02:55,750
What the hell are you doing here?

2051
02:02:56,250 --> 02:02:57,333
Is that a pup?

2052
02:02:57,833 --> 02:02:59,625
Dino, what's going on?

2053
02:03:00,125 --> 02:03:00,750
And what are you doing here?

2054
02:03:01,250 --> 02:03:01,708
Meaning?

2055
02:03:02,208 --> 02:03:02,833
The one you had a crush on..

2056
02:03:03,333 --> 02:03:04,208
..is getting married.

2057
02:03:04,708 --> 02:03:05,458
And you're here to celebrate.

2058
02:03:05,958 --> 02:03:07,125
That's not it.

2059
02:03:07,625 --> 02:03:08,500
She's a friend. - Friend?

2060
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:10,333
I'm a better friend. - So..

2061
02:03:10,833 --> 02:03:13,000
She's getting married to someone else and you..

2062
02:03:13,500 --> 02:03:14,500
You're going to hold a plate and get in line.

2063
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:15,666
Quarrel over biryani.

2064
02:03:16,166 --> 02:03:17,750
Forget about me.

2065
02:03:18,250 --> 02:03:20,041
Tell me what are you doing here?

2066
02:03:20,541 --> 02:03:22,416
Eat biryani or elope with the girl?

2067
02:03:22,916 --> 02:03:26,291
Dino, shall I hand you a plate..

2068
02:03:26,791 --> 02:03:29,166
..or get my bike?

2069
02:03:29,666 --> 02:03:30,666
Uzi. - Yeah.

2070
02:03:31,166 --> 02:03:33,791
This time...let's do something different.

2071
02:03:34,291 --> 02:03:35,416
Oh no.

2072
02:03:35,916 --> 02:03:39,875
She's looking so pretty.

2073
02:03:40,375 --> 02:03:41,791
Uzi, what the hell.

2074
02:03:42,291 --> 02:03:45,791
K, this is Tom.

2075
02:04:01,833 --> 02:04:03,875
Crap!

2076
02:04:04,375 --> 02:04:05,833
Hello.

2077
02:04:06,333 --> 02:04:06,625
Hello.

2078
02:04:07,125 --> 02:04:08,291
Hello.

2079
02:04:08,791 --> 02:04:09,333
Hello.

2080
02:04:09,833 --> 02:04:10,083
Hello.

2081
02:04:10,583 --> 02:04:12,416
You're looking so nice, God bless you. - Thank you.

2082
02:04:12,916 --> 02:04:16,500
Come, sit.

2083
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:17,416
Comfortable? - Yes.

2084
02:04:17,916 --> 02:04:21,416
Thank you. Thanks.

2085
02:04:22,916 --> 02:04:23,166
You?

2086
02:04:23,666 --> 02:04:26,000
Hello, aunt. Hello, uncle.

2087
02:04:26,500 --> 02:04:26,791
Hello.

2088
02:04:27,291 --> 02:04:28,958
You..

2089
02:04:29,458 --> 02:04:30,041
What are you doing here?

2090
02:04:30,541 --> 02:04:32,416
No, I was just passing by..

2091
02:04:32,916 --> 02:04:36,583
..so I thought of dropping in. - What?

2092
02:04:37,083 --> 02:04:39,458
I mean...I wanted to talk to you.

2093
02:04:39,958 --> 02:04:42,000
Talk. Talk about what?

2094
02:04:42,500 --> 02:04:42,833
Talk about what? I will slap you.

2095
02:04:43,333 --> 02:04:43,875
Look, uncle.

2096
02:04:44,375 --> 02:04:46,708
I am no hero...or villain, right.

2097
02:04:47,208 --> 02:04:48,500
We can sort things out.

2098
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:50,291
Get lost. Get out.

2099
02:04:50,791 --> 02:04:52,291
Uncle, I am not here to create a scene.

2100
02:04:52,791 --> 02:04:53,833
I promise you. I didn't even meet Karishma.

2101
02:04:54,333 --> 02:04:55,333
I came straight to you.

2102
02:04:55,833 --> 02:04:56,375
Only to tell my point.

2103
02:04:56,875 --> 02:04:57,750
Why are you listening to him?

2104
02:04:58,250 --> 02:04:58,666
Uncle, just one point.

2105
02:04:59,166 --> 02:04:59,958
Throw him out.

2106
02:05:00,458 --> 02:05:02,541
Excuse me, please throw him out of here.

2107
02:05:03,041 --> 02:05:05,583
Please help us. - Hold on!

2108
02:05:06,083 --> 02:05:08,000
Tell me...what's your point?

2109
02:05:08,500 --> 02:05:10,541
Tell me.

2110
02:05:11,041 --> 02:05:13,375
Uncle, the point is that Karishma and me..

2111
02:05:13,875 --> 02:05:14,541
Karishma?

2112
02:05:15,041 --> 02:05:17,375
We two.. - What?

2113
02:05:17,875 --> 02:05:20,916
We still..

2114
02:05:21,416 --> 02:05:22,083
Don't be scared.

2115
02:05:22,583 --> 02:05:23,208
It's all under control.

2116
02:05:23,708 --> 02:05:24,458
Take it easy.

2117
02:05:24,958 --> 02:05:26,333
Just tell me your point!

2118
02:05:26,833 --> 02:05:29,791
Tell me.

2119
02:05:30,291 --> 02:05:32,375
Sir...the food's ready.

2120
02:05:32,875 --> 02:05:33,791
Food's ready, uncle.

2121
02:05:34,291 --> 02:05:35,125
Why don't you all eat?

2122
02:05:35,625 --> 02:05:36,125
Please eat. It's ready.

2123
02:05:36,625 --> 02:05:38,083
Dinesh. Come here.

2124
02:05:38,583 --> 02:05:40,750
Papa. - Come here.

2125
02:05:41,250 --> 02:05:41,750
But, papa..

2126
02:05:42,250 --> 02:05:43,333
Look, uncle... Karishma will come down..

2127
02:05:43,833 --> 02:05:44,708
..and clear everything.

2128
02:05:45,208 --> 02:05:48,708
Uzi will bring here. Just see, uncle.

2129
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:02,500
Oh crap!

2130
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:10,416
Look...look at him?

2131
02:06:10,916 --> 02:06:12,208
I think he's lost his mind.

2132
02:06:12,708 --> 02:06:21,041
The boy's gone completely mad.

2133
02:06:21,541 --> 02:06:25,041
I know.

2134
02:06:26,166 --> 02:06:26,916
This isn't really happening..

2135
02:06:27,416 --> 02:06:28,791
Get him treated.

2136
02:06:29,291 --> 02:06:31,500
My daughter won't spit on his face.

2137
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:33,833
Dino.

2138
02:06:34,333 --> 02:06:37,833
Oh, God.

2139
02:06:40,833 --> 02:06:42,916
So you're finally here.

2140
02:06:43,416 --> 02:06:44,166
What else did you expect?

2141
02:06:44,666 --> 02:06:45,708
Look at my situation.

2142
02:06:46,208 --> 02:06:48,583
Now do something. Say something.

2143
02:06:49,083 --> 02:06:51,083
Shall I tell them? - Obviously. I need help.

2144
02:06:51,583 --> 02:06:52,708
Hey...what is this? Go back.

2145
02:06:53,208 --> 02:06:54,500
Say something. Say something.

2146
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,416
Go back in Karishma.

2147
02:06:57,916 --> 02:06:59,500
From earth to the sky.

2148
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:00,666
Oh God.

2149
02:07:01,166 --> 02:07:04,500
From the maternity ward to the graveyard.

2150
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:08,000
Even till doomsday.

2151
02:07:08,500 --> 02:07:10,875
There's just one thing in the air.

2152
02:07:11,375 --> 02:07:13,625
Dino and Karishma's mind-blowing love!

2153
02:07:14,125 --> 02:07:15,458
Yes! Yes! Yes!

2154
02:07:15,958 --> 02:07:20,208
Shut up, Karishma, and go inside.

2155
02:07:20,708 --> 02:07:22,833
No one can stop me from living.

2156
02:07:23,333 --> 02:07:25,625
No one can stop me from loving you.

2157
02:07:26,125 --> 02:07:26,625
Karishma, go inside.

2158
02:07:27,125 --> 02:07:33,166
I am made for you... and you're made for me.

2159
02:07:33,666 --> 02:07:35,125
Yes, baby.

2160
02:07:35,625 --> 02:07:36,166
We're leaving.

2161
02:07:36,666 --> 02:07:38,708
I love this life because I love you.

2162
02:07:39,208 --> 02:07:41,625
I love you. I love you.

2163
02:07:42,125 --> 02:07:43,750
Yeah! I told you.

2164
02:07:44,250 --> 02:07:44,708
She loves me.

2165
02:07:45,208 --> 02:07:45,708
She loves me.

2166
02:07:46,208 --> 02:07:46,583
I love you.

2167
02:07:47,083 --> 02:07:47,416
Mother.

2168
02:07:47,916 --> 02:07:48,833
I love you, baby.

2169
02:07:49,333 --> 02:07:51,291
Mother, everyone's leaving.

2170
02:07:51,791 --> 02:07:52,875
Everyone's leaving?

2171
02:07:53,375 --> 02:07:55,333
Dhananjay, go and bring him here.

2172
02:07:55,833 --> 02:07:57,500
I'll talk to them, hold on.

2173
02:07:58,000 --> 02:07:58,750
Don't go, please stay.

2174
02:07:59,250 --> 02:07:59,875
Stay, please.

2175
02:08:00,375 --> 02:08:00,875
This marriage will happen.

2176
02:08:01,375 --> 02:08:03,500
I'll deal with it, just give me a second.

2177
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:04,750
Why don't you do something?

2178
02:08:05,250 --> 02:08:05,666
Do something.

2179
02:08:06,166 --> 02:08:07,166
What do I do?

2180
02:08:07,666 --> 02:08:08,375
She's done everything.

2181
02:08:08,875 --> 02:08:09,833
What do I do? - Sir.

2182
02:08:10,333 --> 02:08:11,125
Sir, the food's ready.

2183
02:08:11,625 --> 02:08:13,416
Throw it in the dustbin. - Uncle.

2184
02:08:13,916 --> 02:08:14,666
Uncle. Uncle.

2185
02:08:15,166 --> 02:08:16,291
What's the point in screaming?

2186
02:08:16,791 --> 02:08:17,583
What's done is done?

2187
02:08:18,083 --> 02:08:19,125
There's no point in yelling.

2188
02:08:19,625 --> 02:08:20,750
But we can do damage control.

2189
02:08:21,250 --> 02:08:22,541
Dev. What are you doing?

2190
02:08:23,041 --> 02:08:24,208
Papa, it's a common problem..

2191
02:08:24,708 --> 02:08:26,333
..so let's find a solution together.

2192
02:08:26,833 --> 02:08:27,791
Right? - Yes.

2193
02:08:28,291 --> 02:08:28,708
Please come, please.

2194
02:08:29,208 --> 02:08:29,500
Mother.

2195
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:31,208
Stop Dhananjay, don't go.

2196
02:08:31,708 --> 02:08:32,500
Stop, Dhananjay. Oh, God.

2197
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:36,500
Even he's gone crazy in their company.

2198
02:08:57,958 --> 02:09:00,500
Witnessed my charm? - Mind-blowing.

2199
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:02,791
But my entry was solid as well.

2200
02:09:03,291 --> 02:09:05,041
Game-changer.

2201
02:09:05,541 --> 02:09:07,875
But you were running after signing the papers.

2202
02:09:08,375 --> 02:09:09,583
I gave you a hint by dropping my tears.

2203
02:09:10,083 --> 02:09:10,541
Oh, really.

2204
02:09:11,041 --> 02:09:13,583
And who stood before Shetty and risked his life?

2205
02:09:14,083 --> 02:09:16,000
Hello, you didn't do me a favor.

2206
02:09:16,500 --> 02:09:17,958
You came here for your own interest. - I see.

2207
02:09:18,458 --> 02:09:20,208
So am I the only one benefitting?

2208
02:09:20,708 --> 02:09:21,333
Yeah, obviously.

2209
02:09:21,833 --> 02:09:22,166
What do you mean?

2210
02:09:22,666 --> 02:09:23,500
Why didn't you stop me in the court that day?

2211
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:24,958
You're telling me. I ran after you.

2212
02:09:25,458 --> 02:09:26,666
You're doing it again.

2213
02:09:27,166 --> 02:09:27,708
Thank you.

2214
02:09:28,208 --> 02:09:29,500
Bye. - Bye.

2215
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:33,666
"You're shining like a diamond in the sky."

2216
02:09:34,166 --> 02:09:35,833
Say something.

2217
02:09:36,333 --> 02:09:37,625
He smiled.

2218
02:09:38,125 --> 02:09:44,083
"You're shining like a diamond in the sky."

2219
02:09:44,583 --> 02:09:48,083
"You're shining like a diamond in the sky."

2220
02:09:56,291 --> 02:09:57,500
My dad didn't know we got married.

2221
02:09:58,000 --> 02:09:59,958
And till now his dad doesn't know about us.

2222
02:10:00,458 --> 02:10:00,791
My mom knows about it.

2223
02:10:01,291 --> 02:10:01,958
All my friends know about it.

2224
02:10:02,458 --> 02:10:04,500
My dad is the only one who doesn't know.

2225
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:06,250
Yes, and I just informed my mom..

2226
02:10:06,750 --> 02:10:08,000
..that I got married one year back.

2227
02:10:08,500 --> 02:10:09,666
He was not well for 4-5 days.

2228
02:10:10,166 --> 02:10:10,958
Continuously I was not well.

2229
02:10:11,458 --> 02:10:12,000
I got Aspro, I gave him.

2230
02:10:12,500 --> 02:10:13,250
I don't know what had happened..

2231
02:10:13,750 --> 02:10:15,916
..from that time onwards we fell in love.

2232
02:10:16,416 --> 02:10:18,375
Even now he's got in his phone Aspro only.

2233
02:10:18,875 --> 02:10:20,166
My name is not there.

2234
02:10:20,666 --> 02:10:21,958
I knew that it would work out.

2235
02:10:22,458 --> 02:10:25,125
I knew that we're destined to be together.

2236
02:10:25,625 --> 02:10:27,708
We're two different people who are made for each other.

2237
02:10:28,208 --> 02:10:31,125
Both of us used to pull everyone else's legs.

2238
02:10:31,625 --> 02:10:32,666
We were always in sync.

2239
02:10:33,166 --> 02:10:35,000
And they were like "You guys' chemistry is really strong".

2240
02:10:35,500 --> 02:10:36,458
"You two should start going out."

2241
02:10:36,958 --> 02:10:39,416
I was like "Oh, God. Are you mad? He's like my brother".

2242
02:10:39,916 --> 02:10:42,208
They were trying to fix her marriage as soon as possible.

2243
02:10:42,708 --> 02:10:43,250
She started receiving marriage proposals.

2244
02:10:43,750 --> 02:10:44,875
So it made me tensed.

2245
02:10:45,375 --> 02:10:48,000
I thought if I don't do anything now..

2246
02:10:48,500 --> 02:10:50,041
..then, I don't have a job, and I'll also lose the girl.

2247
02:10:50,541 --> 02:10:52,458
It got out of hand and they didn't want her to marry me.

2248
02:10:52,958 --> 02:10:55,500
And they put all kind of obstructions in between.

2249
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:56,875
But when you got to do, you got to.

2250
02:10:57,375 --> 02:10:58,958
As they say in Punjabi Manly.

2251
02:10:59,458 --> 02:11:00,791
So that Manly bit took over.

2252
02:11:01,291 --> 02:11:01,666
And I eloped with her.

2253
02:11:02,166 --> 02:11:03,541
It didn't make any difference to our parents.

2254
02:11:04,041 --> 02:11:04,500
They were very confident that..

2255
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:05,500
..we aren't going to do anything..

2256
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:06,833
..and soon come back home.

2257
02:11:07,333 --> 02:11:08,333
But we were determined.

2258
02:11:08,833 --> 02:11:11,500
We now have two kids and we enjoy every day.

2259
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:13,083
It feels like we took the right decision.

2260
02:11:13,583 --> 02:11:14,250
If your wife doesn't cook well..

2261
02:11:14,750 --> 02:11:16,958
..you still say that she cooks well.

2262
02:11:17,458 --> 02:11:18,583
That's it. - But I do cook well.

2263
02:11:19,083 --> 02:11:19,833
She cooks really well.

2264
02:11:20,333 --> 02:11:21,500
No one can cook better than her.

2265
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:23,208
Today we can say anything.

2266
02:11:23,708 --> 02:11:26,125
But at that time, whatever we've done..

2267
02:11:26,625 --> 02:11:28,041
..I think we've done the right thing.

2268
02:11:28,541 --> 02:11:29,333
You know, wonderful, wonderful.

2269
02:11:29,833 --> 02:11:30,041
I'll say that again.

2270
02:11:30,541 --> 02:11:31,916
It's been a super-existence.

2271
02:11:32,416 --> 02:11:33,375
All done...all over again..

2272
02:11:33,875 --> 02:11:35,166
..then I would probably do the same thing.
