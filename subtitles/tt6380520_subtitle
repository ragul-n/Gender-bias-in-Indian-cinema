1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000


3
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,500
'Let me share an episode as example'

4
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,750
'I was just 27 then'

5
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,625
'I had the police job
I liked so much'

6
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,250
'I had it all'

7
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:40,708
'Life presented a 'checkmate' for me'

8
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:45,792
'But even after that trauma
I was still happy'

9
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,292
'Once my colleague asked me'

10
00:03:50,292 --> 00:03:52,333
'Even after such a huge tragedy'

11
00:03:55,292 --> 00:03:57,750
'I had no solid answer then'

12
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:00,500
'With a slight smile
I changed the topic'

13
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:09,875
'But there are some issues
even time cannot cure completely'

14
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,667
'Like a permanent scar'

15
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,000
'It will never fade'

16
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,000
'Looking at it...'

17
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,708
'...only bad memories
will resurface'

18
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:23,625
'This can be dealt with in 2 ways'

19
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:27,000
'One is to keep thinking of it
and drowning in sorrow'

20
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,958
'The other is to adapt
and live along with it'

21
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,792
'I generally don't preach
this kind of philosophy'

22
00:04:38,542 --> 00:04:41,750
'I took some time
to understand all this'

23
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,417
Who is this?

24
00:05:11,417 --> 00:05:14,208
'Did you delete
my number so soon?'

25
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,500
My phone display is cracked, Rajan

26
00:05:17,542 --> 00:05:19,042
How can I help you?

27
00:05:19,042 --> 00:05:21,708
'Sir, I've told you
about my son, right?'

28
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:24,000
You've only told me
you have a son

29
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,083
But you haven't told me
anything else about him

30
00:05:27,542 --> 00:05:28,750
'His name is Guru, sir'

31
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,417
'He graduated and is sitting
at home jobless for past 3 years'

32
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:34,583
'He's refusing to find a job insisting
he'll only join Indian Police Service'

33
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,042
Why be disappointed
of such good news?

34
00:05:37,042 --> 00:05:39,875
'My wife wants him
to go abroad and work'

35
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:43,583
'But he is so stubborn about
joining the police force, sir'

36
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,792
Come to the point
What should I do?

37
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,542
'I have asked him
to meet you'

38
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:50,708
'Tell him how tough and
risky our department is'

39
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,292
'Brainwash him, sir'

40
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,500
'God bless you'

41
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,583
Do you realize how
unfair your wish is?

42
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:58,458
Asking me to make a man
on the right route to reverse

43
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,125
'I have tried all avenues, sir'

44
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:02,208
'He has no intention
of listening to me'

45
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:04,542
'My wife's blood pressure
is shooting up'

46
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,708
'You are my last hope, sir'

47
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:09,708
I'm here

48
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:12,500
'He isn't all that interested
in I.P.S at all, sir'

49
00:06:12,542 --> 00:06:16,083
'This is a convenient excuse
not to go for a regular job'

50
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:19,000
'Seems best to
nip it in the bud'

51
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:23,125
Okay, I'll talk to him
Send him over

52
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,542
'Thank you so much, sir'

53
00:06:25,542 --> 00:06:27,125
'I will ask him to
start right away'

54
00:06:27,167 --> 00:06:29,333
'He'll be at your place in 2 hours'

55
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:34,125
'Sir, he's kind of brusque
Quite reserved'

56
00:06:34,167 --> 00:06:37,542
'A little bit of a groucho
Kindly ignore all that, sir'

57
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,875
Okay, no problem
I'll handle it

58
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:45,583
'I will hang up'

59
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,042
I can't stand for
too long, sonny

60
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,792
The interior of my house
is being renovated

61
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,583
It won't be comfortable inside

62
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,458
We can sit out here and chat

63
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,875
Varnish is over, sir

64
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,458
- How much do you want?
- Rs 500, sir

65
00:07:59,292 --> 00:08:03,875
In a year or so, you'll be
settled in U.S.A or U.K

66
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:08,583
If it's possible, send me
a good walking stick

67
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:13,125
Indian brands are not
worth a naya paisa!

68
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:22,500
Like your father, you want
to join the Police department

69
00:08:24,292 --> 00:08:27,542
Like your father, you want to
be a distinguished officer, right?

70
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:41,625
I'm the only one talking
from the moment you arrived

71
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,542
It is slightly awkward

72
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,708
Next only if you talk...

73
00:08:50,792 --> 00:08:52,417
...I will continue

74
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:56,458
You can leave
after drinking your tea

75
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:58,833
(clears throat)

76
00:08:59,292 --> 00:09:01,125
How did you get this limp?

77
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:07,667
I didn't expect
such a harsh question

78
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:13,708
My last case gave me
this as a retirement gift

79
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,500
I have heard a lot about
that psycho killer case

80
00:09:20,542 --> 00:09:21,958
To be honest...

81
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,167
...my dream to become
a police officer

82
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:26,417
...was born because of that case

83
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:29,125
But I am sure
you would not have...

84
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:33,875
...had a chance to find out
the emotional stress and danger

85
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,167
If you were aware
of the details...

86
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,417
...you will definitely
reconsider this profession

87
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:48,208
Sir, the only reason I'm here
is to find out all about this case

88
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:59,042
I need to know the extent
of your interest before I tell you

89
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:02,542
You said you have heard
a lot about that case, right?

90
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,542
Tell me what you know

91
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:09,750
Then I'll decide whether I should
share any detail with you or not

92
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,542
I don't know 100%

93
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,792
But I'll mix fact and fiction

94
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,958
(song on car-radio)

95
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,375
Hey! Not this song again, please?

96
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,667
Ideal for night time

97
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,875
Monkey! When did you
send a 'request'?

98
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,250
I didn't

99
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,750
She added me

100
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,583
Don't pull a fast one on us

101
00:10:36,667 --> 00:10:39,583
You would've started flirting
the next second with her

102
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,708
I'm not that lame, okay?

103
00:10:41,792 --> 00:10:43,667
Then accept
you gave the 'request'

104
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,250
Why thrive on false prestige?

105
00:10:45,292 --> 00:10:47,583
Listen! I did not add directly

106
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:50,208
Showed in suggestion list
and same college too

107
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,500
You're such a cheapskate

108
00:10:52,542 --> 00:10:55,542
If you call me names
I'll make mincemeat out of you

109
00:11:24,792 --> 00:11:27,083
Fabi, let's get out of here

110
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:30,292
Hold his hand

111
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,208
Hey! What are you doing?

112
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,250
I can't explain now
Just do as I say

113
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:35,875
Lunatic!

114
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,458
Quick, get in

115
00:12:12,042 --> 00:12:13,458
Listen to me

116
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:16,042
Ours is the only car
plying on this road

117
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,792
Everyone in this area is aware

118
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:20,750
Tomorrow if they find
a body lying in a pool of blood

119
00:12:20,792 --> 00:12:22,333
...they won't even enquire

120
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,792
They will drag us by
the scruff of our collars

121
00:12:26,042 --> 00:12:28,708
Only if they find a body
it's an accident!

122
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,958
As of now only we are aware of this

123
00:12:32,542 --> 00:12:33,792
Let it remain that way

124
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:38,250
In a couple of hours the milkman and
newspaperman will be out in the road

125
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,083
Then we can't do anything

126
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,083
Just for tonight
let this body be in the trunk

127
00:12:43,542 --> 00:12:47,875
Without getting caught let us decide
tomorrow how to safely dispose the body

128
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:52,208
If a mistake happens
think how to wriggle out of it

129
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:55,625
Instead if we hold our head
in our hands we achieve nothing

130
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:00,792
Stop...stop

131
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,667
Hey! Stop the car

132
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,417
- Where are you going?
- Going home

133
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:08,500
- Where is your house?
- Closeby, Ambedkar nagar

134
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,375
Show me your license

135
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:14,792
Did it rain inside your car, huh?

136
00:13:15,167 --> 00:13:18,583
- You are drenched to the skin
- We didn't raise the window in time

137
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:20,167
Blow

138
00:13:22,792 --> 00:13:24,167
Blow hard

139
00:13:25,542 --> 00:13:27,458
Get the breathalyzer

140
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,333
We'll pay the fine
Tell us how much

141
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,500
You can pay all that
1st get down

142
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,958
I'm willing to pay the fine

143
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,083
Shut up and get down

144
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,208
Get down
All of you

145
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,500
Why are you getting drenched?

146
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:52,375
Stand over there
I'll join you soon

147
00:13:52,417 --> 00:13:53,792
Yellow Tshirt
Come here

148
00:13:55,792 --> 00:13:57,042
Hold the umbrella

149
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,333
Looking shifty eyed
Something fishy

150
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,583
- Got college in the morning
- Stashed any drugs?

151
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,625
Late night
Let us go, sir

152
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:05,667
Okay, move

153
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:08,042
Come to the station
and collect your car

154
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,708
- Got the key?
- Yes, sir

155
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,167
Drive the car to the station

156
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:15,458
Sir, no need station

157
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,750
All we had was a beer each
Trust us, sir

158
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,625
- Take the car
- Not tanked at all, sir

159
00:14:24,542 --> 00:14:26,458
- What are you doing?
- Get in

160
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,208
What?

161
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,125
We are already in a big mess

162
00:14:55,167 --> 00:14:56,792
You dragged a new problem into it

163
00:14:56,792 --> 00:14:57,875
Blaming me, huh?

164
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:01,333
I'll dump the body in the road
You know how to manage, go ahead

165
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,083
Wait...wait

166
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,583
- Making it worse
- Why did you hit that cop?

167
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:08,250
If I had kept quiet
we'll be holed up in a cell

168
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,250
I was talkin-

169
00:15:09,292 --> 00:15:11,000
We can forget
about our future

170
00:15:11,042 --> 00:15:13,500
I was talking to him
Why did you hit him?

171
00:15:13,542 --> 00:15:15,333
He noted our car number

172
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:19,167
Listen! Hitting a traffic cop
is a case of no consequence

173
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:23,042
Even if the police tried to trace us
it will take them minimum 3 days

174
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,875
You know the car is
registered in Chennai, right?

175
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:30,750
In the 3 days meanwhile, it's enough
if we think of a plan to dispose the body

176
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,792
After that if they catch us
we are safe

177
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,542
He may thrash us in the station

178
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,792
At the worst
detain us for a week

179
00:15:37,667 --> 00:15:40,292
This is much better than
eating gruel for a lifetime

180
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,500
You don't have to
thank me for saving you

181
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:44,875
But you point a finger at me
I'll be furious

182
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:05,750
We haven't mentioned about the boys
and this accident in any of our records

183
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:07,417
How do you know this?

184
00:16:07,417 --> 00:16:09,500
Don't think like a typical policeman

185
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:12,000
This is called fieldwork

186
00:16:22,792 --> 00:16:24,042
What else do you know?

187
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,208
That's all

188
00:16:26,167 --> 00:16:27,792
You must fill up the blanks

189
00:16:30,542 --> 00:16:32,792
I have no problem
telling you the rest of it

190
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,375
But after that...

191
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,500
Let me be the judge

192
00:17:07,042 --> 00:17:09,583
How can you be so sleepy
early in the morning?

193
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,333
Why don't you arrange it
one at a time?

194
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,583
'What is the rush now
to pile up everything?'

195
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:24,083
We have been trying
your mobile from last night

196
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,167
I left it behind here

197
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:29,792
You could have
tried my landline

198
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,667
- Landline?
- Forgot to tell you

199
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:33,458
Yesterday I got
a new connection

200
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:42,500
- What's the matter?
- A suicide in our area, sir

201
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,542
Hanging or
consuming poison?

202
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:47,125
Bharathi park road
Gunshot, sir

203
00:17:48,292 --> 00:17:50,125
- Who?
- Boy's name is Krish, sir

204
00:17:50,167 --> 00:17:51,292
This is his license

205
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,458
Who gave you
the information?

206
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,708
He is waiting outside
I'll bring him in

207
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,625
You are under lock up
Don't forget that

208
00:18:08,792 --> 00:18:10,500
No personal calls
during duty hours

209
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,708
'I'll talk to you later'

210
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,833
Hey! Sonny
Come here

211
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,958
There's a carpet of
dried leaves at the rear

212
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,458
'Will you get your car
the moment you complain?'

213
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,625
'Do you know how many
complain in 1 day?'

214
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,042
I'll keep it on your table

215
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:29,875
He is the one

216
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:34,000
Yov! Tell our Inspector
what you saw early this morning

217
00:18:34,042 --> 00:18:36,208
'Sir, I deliver 'Dinathanthi' newspaper'

218
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:41,125
'On the way to the depot this morning
I saw a man lying by the roadside'

219
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,875
'Thinking he had fainted
I went up to him'

220
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,625
'He had a bullet wound in his head'

221
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:47,125
What time was this?

222
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,625
Around 2:30 a.m I think

223
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:52,042
I came and informed
the station at once, sir

224
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,833
Give your address
to the writer

225
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,000
Okay, sir

226
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:04,000
- Has the body been cleared?
- Yes, sir

227
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,625
Mr Adityan from
Crime Squad cleared it

228
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:07,958
It's a residential area

229
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,875
Not wanting the residents to panic
we did it as fast as we could, sir

230
00:19:12,792 --> 00:19:14,458
Have you informed his family?

231
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:15,708
Not yet, sir

232
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,208
Do that fast

233
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,083
1 minute, sir

234
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,833
Yov! Why are you
screaming your head off?

235
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,542
Sir, 1 minute
Come with me

236
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,667
What's the matter?

237
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:32,667
I saw a white car
at the park this morning

238
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:34,375
It went past our station now

239
00:19:35,167 --> 00:19:36,417
Which car?

240
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,542
I know only the color

241
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:42,792
What are you blabbering?
Is this the only white car on the road?

242
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:46,125
It was parked outside
the station all this while, sir

243
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:48,750
Before I could come in
and tell you it sped past

244
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,542
Okay, all that is
part of our job

245
00:19:51,542 --> 00:19:53,625
You go attend to your work

246
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:01,125
- What is the problem?
- Nothing, sir

247
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:03,000
He saw a white car
in the crime scene

248
00:20:03,042 --> 00:20:07,125
He says he saw the same car in front
of our station and it sped past him now

249
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:08,792
Which car?

250
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,458
We didn't see any such car
when we went, sir

251
00:20:14,792 --> 00:20:16,250
Give me your mobile

252
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:29,083
I'm calling from
my constable's mobile

253
00:20:29,792 --> 00:20:32,875
'From early morning, we have
been trying to reach you'

254
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:35,375
'What happened to your mobile?'

255
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:39,000
I left it behind in the station

256
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:44,125
That's why I called you
Is the postmortem over?

257
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:47,208
Doctor says the report will
be ready only by this evening

258
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,667
I'll ping you
when it's done

259
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:52,375
I wanted to tell you
Rajan thinks this is suicide

260
00:20:54,417 --> 00:20:55,625
What?

261
00:20:55,667 --> 00:21:00,667
To claim the victim shot himself
at the park seems a little odd, right?

262
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:05,167
The gun had fingerprints
of only the deceased

263
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,667
That too in the rain
it was really faded

264
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,750
So we thought
this maybe a suicide

265
00:21:12,542 --> 00:21:14,500
I am on the way
to the crime spot

266
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:17,958
After checking, I'll call you
if I need any other information

267
00:21:19,292 --> 00:21:21,875
Whole of today I will be
using only this mobile

268
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,292
So next time,
don't ask me who this is!

269
00:21:37,667 --> 00:21:39,042
Is this the crime scene?

270
00:21:39,042 --> 00:21:40,333
Over there, sir

271
00:21:42,917 --> 00:21:45,542
- Any police map?
- No, sir

272
00:21:45,542 --> 00:21:48,417
Mr Adityan vetoed it
not wanting to attract a crowd

273
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,375
Get me a glass of water

274
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:56,042
Did he say he saw
the white car here?

275
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,708
Sir, we didn't see any car
when we arrived here

276
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:03,125
He has simply exaggerated
thinking he'll get a reward

277
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:07,583
The media is not in the loop, right?

278
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,792
No, sir, we haven't
informed anyone as yet

279
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:11,417
Case was filed by
a newspaperman

280
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,500
Yes, sir

281
00:22:12,542 --> 00:22:14,583
If it leaks out
we will be in a mess

282
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,333
Don't worry, sir
I'll take care

283
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:26,625
Clean the car
on that side

284
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:40,000
I can't be sure
who did this

285
00:22:40,042 --> 00:22:42,417
But I have 3 suspects in mind, sir

286
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,333
Who...?

287
00:22:49,542 --> 00:22:51,417
'3 boys who live
in this area, sir'

288
00:22:52,792 --> 00:22:55,250
'They take this route
Real late hours at night'

289
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:57,250
'I have seen them often'

290
00:22:59,667 --> 00:23:01,667
'They look like
affluent boys, sir'

291
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:05,500
'There's a good chance
of them owning a gun'

292
00:23:05,792 --> 00:23:08,208
Either they should be
connected with this case

293
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:11,667
Or I feel if we interrogate them,
we'll get some clues for sure

294
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:13,708
- Do you think so?
- Just a gut feeling

295
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:17,000
Whatever a policeman believes
he must trust his intuition!

296
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,083
That's why

297
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:20,042
What if your intuition is wrong?

298
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:21,875
In most of the crimes
with no clues...

299
00:23:21,917 --> 00:23:25,917
...the criminal has to be caught within
48 hours is an unwritten rule, right?

300
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,125
But according to Crime Branch
this could be a suicide case

301
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:33,917
Shooting a man and
placing a gun in his hand

302
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:38,500
We don't have any
evidence or clues as yet

303
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,833
How will we nab him?

304
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:42,417
Sir, please don't think
I am crossing my limits

305
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,875
But if I don't ask you this,
my head will explode

306
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:47,417
Instead of just holding a stick...

307
00:23:47,417 --> 00:23:49,042
...and doing a watchman's job

308
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:51,333
...I want to get involved
in such cases, sir

309
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:55,000
Do what is only assigned
to you by your superiors

310
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,083
Don't unnecessaril-

311
00:23:56,792 --> 00:23:57,875
What is your name?

312
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,208
I joined duty only yesterday

313
00:24:00,292 --> 00:24:02,250
I was informed of
the 2 new recruits

314
00:24:02,292 --> 00:24:03,500
I couldn't meet them

315
00:24:05,792 --> 00:24:07,125
Call our station

316
00:24:07,167 --> 00:24:09,167
Ask someone else
to come to the spot

317
00:24:09,167 --> 00:24:11,667
Gautham will be
with us in this case

318
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:21,708
- Are you sure this is the house?
- Yes, sir

319
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,333
The red Skoda
is right there

320
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:35,250
Check the car thoroughly

321
00:24:38,417 --> 00:24:39,750
Can I come in?

322
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:47,250
Do you know
why we are here?

323
00:24:47,292 --> 00:24:48,500
No

324
00:24:51,167 --> 00:24:54,458
There was a robbery
in the adjacent street

325
00:24:54,958 --> 00:24:57,708
They have threatened
the owner with a gun

326
00:24:58,042 --> 00:24:59,667
We don't possess any gun

327
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:01,625
I never asked you

328
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:04,958
Just wanted to check if the robbers
are hiding in your house

329
00:25:06,042 --> 00:25:07,375
Who owns this house?

330
00:25:07,792 --> 00:25:09,083
It's in my name

331
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:10,792
Your name means?

332
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:12,792
- What is your name?
- Fabian

333
00:25:14,292 --> 00:25:15,458
What about you both?

334
00:25:15,458 --> 00:25:17,167
Sir, I'm Melvin
And he's Mano

335
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:23,375
Only the 3 of you stay
in such a big house?

336
00:25:23,708 --> 00:25:26,792
No, sir, monthly once
his dad will come here

337
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:28,583
We have maintenance staff

338
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:30,333
Where do you work?

339
00:25:34,083 --> 00:25:36,583
I guess 'sir' doesn't feature
in your vocabulary?!

340
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:38,125
It does

341
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:44,792
We'll be the owners of your place
from now on for a while

342
00:25:48,042 --> 00:25:53,375
Check every nook and corner in
this place for robbers or toy guns

343
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,542
All clear, I checked thoroughly

344
00:26:26,583 --> 00:26:28,583
- Trunk?
- Locked, sir

345
00:26:29,667 --> 00:26:31,917
- Give me the key
- We came home late last night

346
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:33,667
Don't know where the key is, sir

347
00:26:33,708 --> 00:26:36,625
It must be in the house
How can it vanish? Get it fast

348
00:26:36,708 --> 00:26:39,708
- May take time to search
- Don't give excuses to an officer

349
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,958
Key must be misplaced-

350
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,083
Won't you know
where you left the key?

351
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:14,958
There's no connection between
this murder and these 3 boys

352
00:27:15,542 --> 00:27:19,333
But I am sure they are
hiding something from us

353
00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:22,000
What is your intuition, Gautham?

354
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:23,917
They need to be
watched closely, sir

355
00:27:30,167 --> 00:27:31,708
Who is AJ?

356
00:27:32,292 --> 00:27:33,917
Our head constable Jana

357
00:27:34,542 --> 00:27:36,625
Park the car
next to the kerb

358
00:27:42,708 --> 00:27:44,042
Tell me

359
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:45,667
When...?

360
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:49,625
Okay
Address?

361
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:50,792
In half an hour-

362
00:27:50,792 --> 00:27:51,917
He's here

363
00:29:06,667 --> 00:29:07,917
Who called the station?

364
00:29:07,958 --> 00:29:09,042
Sir, I did

365
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:10,708
I'm Shruti's neighbor, Ganesh

366
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,042
I live in flat #2B

367
00:29:13,917 --> 00:29:15,458
First witness, huh?

368
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:17,833
No, sir, I didn't even
go into her apartment

369
00:29:18,292 --> 00:29:21,250
Around 7 o'clock Shruti's friend
knocked on my door

370
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,667
In a state of panic she said the room was
full of blood and Shruti was missing

371
00:29:26,167 --> 00:29:28,000
I had no idea what to do

372
00:29:28,167 --> 00:29:30,250
I dialed 100 at once
and called the cops

373
00:29:30,958 --> 00:29:33,500
'Can't you see the steps?'

374
00:29:33,583 --> 00:29:36,625
'If the furniture gets damaged,
will you take responsibility?'

375
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:37,917
'What can I say?'

376
00:29:37,917 --> 00:29:39,000
'Lift it...lift'

377
00:29:39,417 --> 00:29:41,125
When did you call the station?

378
00:29:41,167 --> 00:29:43,167
Must be around 7:30 p.m, sir

379
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,958
He said he'll be here
in 5 minutes

380
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,083
But I had to wait
for nearly 2 hours

381
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:50,167
That's why I called again
15 minutes ago to remind them

382
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:53,000
Rajan, he called at 7:30 p.m

383
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,333
Then why were we informed so late?

384
00:29:56,167 --> 00:29:57,708
Sir, 1 minute

385
00:30:02,792 --> 00:30:05,792
Actually at 7:30
we were near the park

386
00:30:05,792 --> 00:30:08,375
Only the new constable
was in the station

387
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:11,500
He noted down the address
but forgot to inform us I think, sir

388
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,000
Gautham is also new, right?

389
00:30:13,042 --> 00:30:14,500
Call that constable

390
00:30:14,792 --> 00:30:17,250
Sir, I don't have
his phone number

391
00:30:17,625 --> 00:30:19,958
Rajan, don't give me such excuses

392
00:30:20,625 --> 00:30:23,750
Call Jana and connect me
I'll talk to the new recruit

393
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,625
- Your name?
- Vaishnavi, sir

394
00:30:31,167 --> 00:30:33,292
Explain what happened
in detail to me

395
00:31:01,167 --> 00:31:04,083
- Is this house key always with you?
- Yes, sir

396
00:31:04,083 --> 00:31:06,500
Every weekend I will
come here from Chennai

397
00:31:06,708 --> 00:31:10,458
My arrival time is indefinite
So the spare key is always with me

398
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:15,042
- What do you do in Chennai?
- I work in CTS as Program Executive, sir

399
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:17,625
Do you have your bus ticket?

400
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:22,458
Are you related to Shruti?

401
00:31:25,708 --> 00:31:27,875
When did you last speak to Shruti?

402
00:31:27,875 --> 00:31:29,292
Yesterday evening, sir

403
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:32,292
When did you say
you came here?

404
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:34,958
I reached Chennai
only at 6:30 a.m, sir

405
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,167
Approximately

406
00:31:38,458 --> 00:31:39,583
Call Shruti's mobile-

407
00:31:39,625 --> 00:31:40,750
It's switched off

408
00:31:45,458 --> 00:31:46,458
What happened?

409
00:31:46,458 --> 00:31:48,417
I called him, sir
No one picked up

410
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:50,833
I think he'll call after
seeing my 'missed' call

411
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,958
Got any relatives in Coimbatore?

412
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,083
No, sir

413
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:00,667
You know Mr Ganesh well, right?

414
00:32:00,708 --> 00:32:03,917
Not really, I've spoken to him
a couple of times when I was here

415
00:32:04,375 --> 00:32:06,917
Because we can't allow
anyone inside the house

416
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:09,917
If you want to refresh,
you can go to his house-

417
00:32:14,958 --> 00:32:17,708
Can you accommodate her
in your house for a day?

418
00:32:19,667 --> 00:32:20,875
We don't mind

419
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:25,000
We still haven't got
a clear picture of anything

420
00:32:25,167 --> 00:32:26,708
Until we resolve this...

421
00:32:26,792 --> 00:32:28,875
...you need to stay
only in Coimbatore

422
00:32:28,875 --> 00:32:31,292
I'll make alternate
arrangements for your stay

423
00:32:33,375 --> 00:32:34,625
Where is Gautham?

424
00:32:35,958 --> 00:32:38,500
I'll call him, he's talking
to the watchman upstairs

425
00:32:43,292 --> 00:32:45,167
Ask the watchman to come down

426
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:48,458
Investigate in
the other apartments

427
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,708
I will send someone
from the Crime Branch

428
00:32:53,542 --> 00:32:55,917
- Let me check around once
- Go ahead

429
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:02,708
You work night shift
or day shift?

430
00:33:03,708 --> 00:33:06,042
Yesterday were you
in the apartment then?

431
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:07,167
Yes, sir

432
00:33:07,417 --> 00:33:09,625
Too many flats here
It is tough to remember

433
00:33:09,625 --> 00:33:10,958
Still try to think and tell me

434
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,750
When did Shruti
enter her flat?

435
00:33:12,792 --> 00:33:16,000
Don't know the exact time, sir

436
00:33:16,542 --> 00:33:19,708
But when I came for work,
Shruti's scooty was parked here

437
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,167
When did you come?

438
00:33:21,292 --> 00:33:22,875
Please don't tell the secretary

439
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:24,625
I will lose my job, sir

440
00:33:25,167 --> 00:33:28,833
I had gone to my hometown
I came back only at 5:00 a.m, sir

441
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:31,083
When did the day shift
watchman leave?

442
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:33,000
He left at 8:30, sir

443
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,625
Is there a security camera?

444
00:33:36,625 --> 00:33:37,625
What, sir?

445
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:42,500
It is usually fixed
in the parking lot

446
00:33:42,542 --> 00:33:43,875
We don't have all that

447
00:33:43,958 --> 00:33:46,542
The new constable
has called from the station

448
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,042
You carry on

449
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:52,042
Suresh, the new constable

450
00:33:54,708 --> 00:33:57,167
You joined work only yesterday

451
00:33:57,333 --> 00:33:59,417
New atmosphere
You are very young

452
00:33:59,458 --> 00:34:02,667
Because of these reasons
when someone complains...

453
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:06,583
...no rules stipulate you shouldn't
inform higher officials, Suresh

454
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:08,167
'Sir, please forgive me'

455
00:34:08,167 --> 00:34:10,000
'I thought it was a prank call'

456
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:15,750
'Seemed like he was telling me
a serious issue in a playful way, sir'

457
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,625
Our network is like this

458
00:34:19,667 --> 00:34:22,250
When it is an emergency call...

459
00:34:22,292 --> 00:34:25,667
...it won't come to our station
It is linked to the control room

460
00:34:25,667 --> 00:34:28,292
The control room will
receive the complaint

461
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:30,667
And only then inform
our police station

462
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,917
Officers in the control room will not
know the seriousness of this situation

463
00:34:35,958 --> 00:34:38,167
They will treat everything lightly

464
00:34:38,167 --> 00:34:39,292
Understood?

465
00:34:40,833 --> 00:34:42,875
'You've said I should not
give any reasons'

466
00:34:42,917 --> 00:34:45,250
'But other than the fact
I'm new to the job...'

467
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,083
'...I don't know
what else to say'

468
00:34:47,292 --> 00:34:49,292
Please learn the basics

469
00:34:51,833 --> 00:34:53,333
Think and let me know

470
00:34:53,375 --> 00:34:55,875
Any other key piece of information...

471
00:34:56,167 --> 00:34:57,792
...not conveyed to us?

472
00:34:57,833 --> 00:35:01,625
'Aren't you in Shruti's flat
in Saroj Prayag apartments?'

473
00:35:01,625 --> 00:35:02,667
Yes

474
00:35:02,708 --> 00:35:06,708
'Shruti came to our station yesterday
and complained about eve teasing, sir '

475
00:35:07,417 --> 00:35:08,542
Against whom?

476
00:35:08,917 --> 00:35:10,625
'Didn't give a proper address, sir'

477
00:35:10,667 --> 00:35:13,125
'But she specified the area
as Ambedkar Nagar'

478
00:35:13,167 --> 00:35:15,042
'The boy's name is Mano, sir'

479
00:35:30,167 --> 00:35:31,500
Who is Mano?

480
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,792
I'll ask you some questions now

481
00:35:43,792 --> 00:35:45,833
Just answer yes or no

482
00:35:45,917 --> 00:35:47,083
Okay...?

483
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:05,833
Do you know Shruti living
in Saroj Prayag apartments?

484
00:36:05,875 --> 00:36:07,167
Yes, sir

485
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:09,042
Have you spoken to her?

486
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,250
Yes, sir

487
00:36:10,292 --> 00:36:11,625
Have you stalked her?

488
00:36:11,667 --> 00:36:12,750
No, sir

489
00:36:12,792 --> 00:36:15,083
- Threatened to kill her?
- No way, sir

490
00:36:24,833 --> 00:36:26,167
You said you know her

491
00:36:27,167 --> 00:36:28,833
10 days ago-

492
00:36:29,417 --> 00:36:32,417
'That girl was riding a scooty
She almost banged into our car'

493
00:36:34,167 --> 00:36:37,667
'She apologized and accepted
it was her fault and left, sir'

494
00:36:37,708 --> 00:36:38,917
'That's all'

495
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,583
'That was the first time I met her'

496
00:36:47,542 --> 00:36:50,167
Did she ride fast or
were you speeding?

497
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,917
She was the one who swerved
too much to the left

498
00:36:54,292 --> 00:36:55,875
You look decent

499
00:36:56,042 --> 00:36:58,958
Then why did she complain
against you for eve teasing?

500
00:37:00,917 --> 00:37:02,708
When did you last see that girl?

501
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:05,333
10 days ago when
this incident happened

502
00:37:11,542 --> 00:37:14,458
Can you please tell us why
you called us to the station?

503
00:37:16,792 --> 00:37:19,250
Finally looks like
you used the word 'sir'

504
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:26,167
Shruti who lived in Saroj Prayag
near your house is missing

505
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:31,292
The interesting part here is...

506
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:35,667
...she has lodged an eve teasing complaint
against a Mano residing in Ambedkar Nagar

507
00:37:38,542 --> 00:37:42,083
This reason is good enough
to investigate you!

508
00:37:43,083 --> 00:37:44,833
Is he the only Mano in our area?

509
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:46,583
Yes...'sir'!

510
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:48,875
If you don't believe me...

511
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:51,333
...check the voters list
of Ambedkar Nagar

512
00:37:51,375 --> 00:37:53,667
Only Mano in that area is your friend

513
00:37:55,667 --> 00:37:58,083
'How can there be
no other Mano?'

514
00:38:01,292 --> 00:38:02,750
Give me your mobile

515
00:38:03,542 --> 00:38:05,042
Any problem, sir?

516
00:38:05,042 --> 00:38:07,167
My phone is not charging
It's switched off

517
00:38:07,583 --> 00:38:08,958
Plug it in that socket

518
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,750
Hello, Adityan

519
00:38:17,167 --> 00:38:18,625
'Process is going on'

520
00:38:19,292 --> 00:38:21,500
Not about that
I'm handling a small case

521
00:38:22,625 --> 00:38:24,292
A girl in this area is missing

522
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:26,542
Found traces of blood
in her bedroom

523
00:38:28,792 --> 00:38:31,167
Can you please seal
that place immediately?

524
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:33,583
'We still haven't cleared
this case, sir'

525
00:38:35,833 --> 00:38:37,083
But what to do?

526
00:38:37,083 --> 00:38:38,458
'What is the address?'

527
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,083
I'll text it to you

528
00:38:40,167 --> 00:38:43,792
Constable Gautham will be in the spot
You can coordinate with him

529
00:39:06,167 --> 00:39:09,917
Any idea how the case
might have travelled after this?

530
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,875
I know where this will end

531
00:39:13,625 --> 00:39:17,583
But there are a few missing links
in between which aren't very clear

532
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:25,250
Isn't it boring to watch the film
knowing what the climax is, right?

533
00:39:27,167 --> 00:39:29,708
It depends on the way
you narrate your story

534
00:39:31,167 --> 00:39:33,458
'After informing Adityan...'

535
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,542
'...I told those 3 boys to wait
in the station and I left'

536
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:40,458
'That's where I got
the first hint in the murder case'

537
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,958
'The bullet in Krish's head was 9 mm'

538
00:39:43,125 --> 00:39:44,875
'This is used by policemen'

539
00:39:47,958 --> 00:39:49,458
Check inside

540
00:39:53,917 --> 00:39:56,375
Doesn't look like a fight
or robbery in the crime scene

541
00:39:57,583 --> 00:40:00,292
While checking we found
Shruti's identity card

542
00:40:01,167 --> 00:40:03,167
In fact yesterday
was Shruti's birthday

543
00:40:04,708 --> 00:40:07,542
According to Shruti's I.D card
her blood group was O+

544
00:40:07,625 --> 00:40:10,000
But we checked
the blood group on the wall

545
00:40:14,917 --> 00:40:16,958
Sir, what happened
to the other case?

546
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:20,833
Can I sit here?

547
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:28,958
Most girls have problems
because of relationship issues

548
00:40:29,083 --> 00:40:32,167
So you think we should start
from her point of view

549
00:40:32,167 --> 00:40:33,292
I already did, sir

550
00:40:34,417 --> 00:40:35,833
He's like that

551
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:37,833
He will surprise me
every now and then

552
00:40:38,292 --> 00:40:39,667
Tell me, Mr Gautham

553
00:40:39,708 --> 00:40:41,000
What did you infer?

554
00:40:41,042 --> 00:40:43,250
I interrogated everyone here, sir

555
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:45,958
'According to everyone
Shruti stays alone'

556
00:40:46,042 --> 00:40:47,542
'No parents or guardians'

557
00:40:47,625 --> 00:40:49,958
'But I believe a guy
visits her now and then'

558
00:40:49,958 --> 00:40:52,833
'Once her neighbor in flat #3A
asked Shruti about him'

559
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:55,708
'She told him he was her fiancé'

560
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:59,167
'He is the only one who has seen
that guy in this apartment'

561
00:41:05,083 --> 00:41:06,458
Boy's name is Krish

562
00:41:06,625 --> 00:41:07,792
This is his license

563
00:41:12,917 --> 00:41:15,167
What did you say was
the blood group on the wall?

564
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:41,333
'Once her neighbor in flat #3A
asked Shruti about him'

565
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:44,625
'He is the only one who has seen
that guy in this apartment'

566
00:41:47,333 --> 00:41:49,667
Sir, was it this man you saw?

567
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,042
Our 1st priority

568
00:42:01,042 --> 00:42:03,833
To find out who the boy is
Shruti complained about

569
00:42:03,833 --> 00:42:05,417
Sir, what about that Mano?

570
00:42:05,542 --> 00:42:08,208
In Shruti's case it doesn't
look like they are lying

571
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:11,125
Their answers seem to be convincing

572
00:42:11,167 --> 00:42:13,875
Crime Branch team has come
You don't have to be here

573
00:42:13,917 --> 00:42:17,167
Go to Ambedkar Nagar and do
the same questioning you did here

574
00:42:20,208 --> 00:42:21,417
I'll go up and
get my cap

575
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,167
You are a 90s kid, right?

576
00:42:27,208 --> 00:42:29,625
You would've definitely
played the Mario game

577
00:42:32,542 --> 00:42:35,417
In the beginning
of that game

578
00:42:35,875 --> 00:42:37,250
There are 3 lives

579
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:42,125
You'll jump across
in some spot

580
00:42:43,125 --> 00:42:45,750
You'll get a 'life' from
a magic brick over there

581
00:42:47,375 --> 00:42:48,417
Do you know?

582
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:51,958
But I didn't get
anything of that sort

583
00:42:52,125 --> 00:42:53,375
You will get

584
00:42:53,542 --> 00:42:55,667
Same holds good
in all cases

585
00:42:55,917 --> 00:42:57,792
There will be
a magic brick

586
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:00,542
You don't have to go
in search of it

587
00:43:01,292 --> 00:43:02,958
The brick will come
in search of you

588
00:43:03,042 --> 00:43:06,458
- Agreed, but how can you refuse?
- Don't torture me, sir

589
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:07,875
It seems he can't give it back

590
00:43:08,375 --> 00:43:09,500
I won't give it, sir

591
00:43:09,542 --> 00:43:11,042
- What happened?
- Look at them

592
00:43:11,042 --> 00:43:13,708
They are hell bent on taking
a film in front of the apartment

593
00:43:13,708 --> 00:43:15,167
They are torturing me, sir

594
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:20,875
We were only shooting a short film
We didn't disturb anyone, sir

595
00:43:21,042 --> 00:43:22,333
This is a residential area

596
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:23,833
Sir, we didn't disturb anyone

597
00:43:23,875 --> 00:43:25,667
He is exaggerating, sir

598
00:43:25,708 --> 00:43:27,375
We have a competition tomor-

599
00:43:28,292 --> 00:43:31,083
Sir, we have to edit tomorrow
All our files are in there, sir

600
00:43:31,125 --> 00:43:32,833
Collect it from the station
in the evening

601
00:43:32,875 --> 00:43:34,208
For 6 months
we've been work-

602
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:41,750
Enquire in every house

603
00:43:42,708 --> 00:43:45,500
Make sure you mark
even the slightest doubt

604
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:48,958
I'll do the needful, sir

605
00:43:55,083 --> 00:43:56,792
'Sir, I'm Gautham speaking'

606
00:43:56,792 --> 00:43:58,250
'Yes, Gautham'

607
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:00,667
'What is Shruti's complaint
against Mano?'

608
00:44:01,083 --> 00:44:06,750
'He has stopped her in the middle of
the road yesterday and created a ruckus'

609
00:44:06,792 --> 00:44:09,500
'That girl has used a string
of cuss words on him'

610
00:44:09,542 --> 00:44:12,208
'And livid with rage has
complained in the station'

611
00:44:26,083 --> 00:44:27,458
Krish's father, sir

612
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,583
He's here to complain
about his missing son

613
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:31,542
Didn't I tell you this morning
to inform him?

614
00:44:31,583 --> 00:44:33,083
You had Krish's license

615
00:44:33,083 --> 00:44:34,667
I didn't note down
his address

616
00:44:35,333 --> 00:44:36,958
Is that a valid reason, Rajan?

617
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:38,708
Ask him to be seated inside

618
00:44:42,458 --> 00:44:44,542
Sir, please wait inside

619
00:44:45,292 --> 00:44:46,958
I had asked you about
taking off, sir?

620
00:44:46,958 --> 00:44:49,667
Boys, give your mobile number here

621
00:44:49,667 --> 00:44:50,917
I am at the station

622
00:44:50,958 --> 00:44:53,750
- We'll call you anytime
- I'll meet the Inspector and come

623
00:44:54,875 --> 00:44:56,708
Sir will be here soon
Please be seated

624
00:44:56,708 --> 00:44:57,875
'You can leave now'

625
00:44:57,875 --> 00:45:00,458
'But tomorrow I want
to see all 3 of you'

626
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,458
Have you given a complaint?

627
00:45:14,417 --> 00:45:15,667
What can I do for you?

628
00:45:15,708 --> 00:45:17,292
My name is Sriram

629
00:45:17,583 --> 00:45:20,833
My son is usually back home
by 9'o clock every night

630
00:45:21,375 --> 00:45:24,083
He is missing from last night

631
00:45:24,417 --> 00:45:26,208
He messages if he is delayed

632
00:45:26,458 --> 00:45:28,208
We didn't get any message either

633
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:31,958
My wife is very worried

634
00:45:32,375 --> 00:45:34,542
That's why I thought
I should let you know

635
00:45:34,667 --> 00:45:35,792
Sir, this boy's father-

636
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:37,333
I was also a police officer

637
00:45:37,792 --> 00:45:39,042
I was posted in Delhi

638
00:45:39,958 --> 00:45:43,250
I retired 5 years ago and
I'm settled now in Chennai

639
00:45:43,583 --> 00:45:45,708
Sorry, I didn't salute you
as my senior officer

640
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:47,208
No formalities at all

641
00:45:51,625 --> 00:45:53,250
I need to tell you something

642
00:45:53,458 --> 00:45:55,500
I don't know how you will take it

643
00:46:00,417 --> 00:46:02,125
Someone has shot your son

644
00:46:03,208 --> 00:46:04,583
When?

645
00:46:05,167 --> 00:46:06,625
This morning

646
00:46:06,875 --> 00:46:09,208
Who...er...why?

647
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:11,500
Don't know
We are searching

648
00:46:28,958 --> 00:46:33,375
To see parents lose
their children and grieve...

649
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:36,875
...there isn't a more
depressing sight you know

650
00:46:37,875 --> 00:46:39,625
I'm not in the frame
of mind to talk now

651
00:46:39,667 --> 00:46:41,500
I'll come to the station tomorrow

652
00:46:42,167 --> 00:46:43,375
He was our only son

653
00:46:44,125 --> 00:46:45,958
How will I break
this news to my wif-

654
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:47,250
I don't know

655
00:47:03,083 --> 00:47:06,250
If Adityan calls, ask him to
get in touch with me in my landline

656
00:47:11,833 --> 00:47:13,458
You are on night duty, right?

657
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:14,583
Yes, sir

658
00:47:14,583 --> 00:47:15,958
Sir, is your mobile alright now?

659
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:17,125
I think it's charged

660
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,875
I'll switch it on
at home and check

661
00:47:21,333 --> 00:47:24,458
All those in the spot today
can report to work tomorrow evening

662
00:47:37,875 --> 00:47:39,083
Hello, Deepak

663
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:49,042
Someone was waiting in front
of your house for a long time

664
00:47:49,583 --> 00:47:50,583
Who?

665
00:47:53,417 --> 00:47:54,875
Must be around 6:00 p.m

666
00:47:54,875 --> 00:47:57,417
I saw him when I was getting
back home from my walk

667
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:00,167
I don't know where
he went after that

668
00:48:00,875 --> 00:48:03,042
Okay, let me see tomorrow

669
00:48:34,542 --> 00:48:39,375
'The mobile number
you are calling is switched off'

670
00:49:04,083 --> 00:49:05,167
'Sir, I'm Rajan speaking'

671
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:07,500
'There are 2 college boys here'

672
00:49:07,542 --> 00:49:11,208
'It seems you asked them to collect
their camera this evening at the station'

673
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,958
Completely skipped my mind
It is in my car, Rajan

674
00:49:14,542 --> 00:49:16,333
Ask them to collect it tomorrow

675
00:49:16,375 --> 00:49:17,375
'Okay, sir'

676
00:49:31,417 --> 00:49:33,708
'It seems they want
the camera tonight'

677
00:49:33,708 --> 00:49:36,583
'The required files are in it
for their competition tomorrow'

678
00:49:36,792 --> 00:49:40,417
'They worked so hard for a month
They are cribbing their heads off'

679
00:49:40,458 --> 00:49:42,500
Ask them to come home
and pick it up

680
00:49:57,333 --> 00:49:58,667
Which college?

681
00:49:58,875 --> 00:49:59,958
K.L.M, sir

682
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:04,500
Why are you so perturbed?

683
00:50:04,542 --> 00:50:05,667
I'll give it to you

684
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:10,708
What is your film about?

685
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:12,958
Fregoli delusion
Based on that condition

686
00:50:14,667 --> 00:50:16,500
- Name?
- Name of the film, sir?

687
00:50:16,667 --> 00:50:17,667
'Prathi'

688
00:50:17,708 --> 00:50:19,167
'Reflection'

689
00:50:21,417 --> 00:50:23,167
Tomorrow is the competition

690
00:50:23,625 --> 00:50:26,625
And you say the files are
still in the camera today

691
00:50:27,208 --> 00:50:29,375
Don't you have lots to do
after shooting it?

692
00:50:29,417 --> 00:50:30,875
We've taken the final output

693
00:50:30,875 --> 00:50:33,667
Just for safety we were
shooting an alternate climax

694
00:50:35,042 --> 00:50:37,875
Whatever! If such an expensive
camera is confiscated...

695
00:50:37,917 --> 00:50:39,958
...you know it is tough
to get it back

696
00:50:42,667 --> 00:50:44,125
I'll return it

697
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:45,500
I don't have any problem

698
00:50:45,833 --> 00:50:48,500
But you didn't shoot any girl

699
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:51,375
What is the guarantee
you shot only a film?

700
00:50:51,417 --> 00:50:53,875
Sir, we took only
4 shots last night

701
00:50:53,875 --> 00:50:56,583
Before we could shoot today
the watchman grabbed it from us

702
00:50:56,625 --> 00:50:57,750
If you want we can...

703
00:50:57,875 --> 00:51:00,167
...show you what we took
and then take it, sir

704
00:51:11,375 --> 00:51:12,375
'Are you ready?'

705
00:51:12,417 --> 00:51:14,958
'Just a minute, dude
Lighting has gone for a toss'

706
00:51:14,958 --> 00:51:17,500
'- Hurry up!
- Are we shooting in Red?'

707
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:20,292
(memorizing dialogs)

708
00:51:20,333 --> 00:51:21,417
'Do it fast'

709
00:51:22,875 --> 00:51:25,458
'Gawd! You come just to
disturb us, huh?'

710
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:26,792
'Hey buddy
A cool chick!'

711
00:51:28,333 --> 00:51:30,125
'Auto, anna
Please move'

712
00:51:33,792 --> 00:51:36,042
'When did you say
you came here?'

713
00:51:36,083 --> 00:51:38,750
'I reached Chennai
only at 6:30 a.m, sir'

714
00:51:38,792 --> 00:51:39,958
'Approximately'

715
00:51:47,125 --> 00:51:49,125
'Can't you focus properly?'

716
00:51:49,167 --> 00:51:51,667
'A white car, sir
I know only that'

717
00:51:52,125 --> 00:51:54,583
- When did you shoot this video?
- 11:00 p.m, sir

718
00:51:55,417 --> 00:51:58,458
- The time you went to the apartment
- 10:30 p.m, sir

719
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:01,125
We shot for half an hour
Then it started raining heavily

720
00:52:01,125 --> 00:52:02,500
- Around 11:10
- I think so

721
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:03,875
We left by 11:10 p.m, sir

722
00:52:04,167 --> 00:52:07,042
- Was that car parked there when you came?
- Yes, sir

723
00:52:07,042 --> 00:52:08,083
Take that card

724
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:12,583
Other than the girl did you see
anyone else go into that flat?

725
00:52:12,625 --> 00:52:15,708
When we reached there and
we were preparing, we saw 1 man go in

726
00:52:15,958 --> 00:52:18,042
Any snap or video of him?

727
00:52:18,083 --> 00:52:19,958
Who was taking the 'making' video?

728
00:52:19,958 --> 00:52:21,667
Call him
it's okay, call

729
00:52:21,667 --> 00:52:23,583
Keep trying, he won't
pick up immediately

730
00:52:24,333 --> 00:52:25,500
Low battery in my phone

731
00:52:25,542 --> 00:52:27,125
- Rajan
- Tell me, sir

732
00:52:27,167 --> 00:52:28,875
Give me Gautham's contact number

733
00:52:28,917 --> 00:52:29,958
1 minute

734
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:34,083
Sir, will you note it down?

735
00:52:44,958 --> 00:52:46,417
Don't get me wrong

736
00:52:46,417 --> 00:52:48,458
Don't take off
till tomorrow evening

737
00:52:48,458 --> 00:52:49,958
Report to duty
in the morning

738
00:52:51,083 --> 00:52:52,667
That's no problem at all

739
00:52:54,083 --> 00:52:55,542
Dial that number

740
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:14,833
Even on the 1st day I believed
you'll recognize my voice

741
00:53:16,875 --> 00:53:18,667
Phone voice sounds different, right?

742
00:53:19,583 --> 00:53:21,125
Did you enquire
in that area?

743
00:53:21,125 --> 00:53:22,958
I knocked at
all the doors, sir

744
00:53:22,958 --> 00:53:25,875
There isn't any Mano
who will fit our sketch, sir

745
00:53:25,917 --> 00:53:28,500
Is there anyone else
by that name?

746
00:53:28,583 --> 00:53:32,250
At #10 there is an 86 year old
by the name of Manoranjan, sir

747
00:53:34,333 --> 00:53:35,958
He will return it
Stop bugging me

748
00:53:36,042 --> 00:53:39,917
Do you feel I'm making you work
too hard on your very 1st day?

749
00:53:40,792 --> 00:53:44,250
I think this case is a warm welcome
to the Police department, sir

750
00:53:45,667 --> 00:53:49,208
Then I don't need to take permission
to make you work overtime, eh?

751
00:53:51,042 --> 00:53:54,083
I've got an important break

752
00:53:54,375 --> 00:53:56,708
I called you to
ask your opinion

753
00:53:56,958 --> 00:53:58,417
Come home right away

754
00:53:58,458 --> 00:54:00,125
Okay, sir, I'll be there
in 20 minutes

755
00:54:00,167 --> 00:54:01,125
My addres-

756
00:54:03,792 --> 00:54:05,708
Don't fuss too much
Your camera is safe

757
00:54:14,333 --> 00:54:17,833
In your excitement
should not miss important details

758
00:54:24,625 --> 00:54:25,625
I'll be there

759
00:54:25,667 --> 00:54:27,042
Mufti or uniform, sir?

760
00:54:31,417 --> 00:54:35,417
Do either of you intend
joining the Police force?

761
00:54:37,958 --> 00:54:38,750
No, sir

762
00:54:40,333 --> 00:54:43,250
You should have seen
the reaction of those 2 boys

763
00:54:43,958 --> 00:54:46,750
Having stumbled on a clue
I got so hyper

764
00:54:47,167 --> 00:54:49,333
Those boys were quite terrified

765
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:56,750
There is still some time left

766
00:54:58,375 --> 00:55:00,458
What did you infer
from this video?

767
00:55:00,667 --> 00:55:03,042
Vaishnavi is hiding
something from us, sir

768
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:06,250
You don't have any doubts
on the car parked outside the apartment?

769
00:55:06,292 --> 00:55:09,250
That newspaper chap said
he saw a white car, right?

770
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:13,792
It may also belong to
someone in the apartment

771
00:55:14,417 --> 00:55:17,875
Why would the resident
park it outside then?

772
00:55:31,833 --> 00:55:33,458
Call Vaishnavi

773
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,708
She just stepped out
for a walk, sir

774
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:37,875
It's 10:00 p.m now

775
00:55:37,875 --> 00:55:39,458
She went for a walk at this hour?

776
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:41,750
She left a while ago

777
00:55:41,792 --> 00:55:43,500
Whole day she was
quite disturbed

778
00:55:43,542 --> 00:55:46,125
She said she may feel better
if she went for a walk

779
00:55:46,167 --> 00:55:48,250
Okay, give me
her mobile number

780
00:56:09,125 --> 00:56:10,500
What happened, sir?

781
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:12,292
Are her belongings in here?

782
00:56:12,292 --> 00:56:14,542
She brought just 1 bag
She has kept it inside

783
00:56:16,208 --> 00:56:17,875
When is the last bus to Chennai?

784
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:21,125
One at 10:15 p.m and
another at 10:30 p.m, sir

785
00:56:21,167 --> 00:56:22,208
Let's go

786
00:56:33,792 --> 00:56:36,750
'Someone was waiting in front
of your house for a long time'

787
00:56:36,792 --> 00:56:38,375
'Who?'

788
00:56:43,417 --> 00:56:45,083
'Whole day she was
quite disturbed'

789
00:56:45,083 --> 00:56:48,167
'She said she may feel better
if she went for a walk'

790
00:56:52,083 --> 00:56:53,125
'10 days ago'

791
00:56:53,167 --> 00:56:55,958
'That girl was riding a scooty
She almost banged into our car'

792
00:56:55,958 --> 00:56:58,417
'She apologized and accepted
it was her fault and left, sir'

793
00:56:58,458 --> 00:56:59,875
'That was the first time I met her'

794
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:03,417
'- When did you last see that girl?
-10 days ago when this happened'

795
00:57:05,625 --> 00:57:09,417
'Why would the resident
park it outside then?'

796
00:57:52,708 --> 00:57:55,208
She might have booked her ticket
in some other name, sir

797
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:57,375
If we trace her
with her mobile number...

798
00:57:57,417 --> 00:57:59,042
...we can nab her before dawn

799
00:58:00,958 --> 00:58:02,333
Tell me, sir

800
00:58:06,917 --> 00:58:09,583
Get me details of this car
and let me know

801
00:58:11,875 --> 00:58:14,917
Do you suspect anyone
at this stage?

802
00:58:15,042 --> 00:58:16,250
Yes, sir

803
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:18,875
But only theories
Not confirmed

804
00:58:19,625 --> 00:58:20,958
It's okay, tell me

805
00:58:21,375 --> 00:58:23,625
When I went to investigate
in Ambedkar Nagar...

806
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:26,125
...most houses complained
only about one chap

807
00:58:26,583 --> 00:58:27,875
Fabian

808
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:30,583
Some said he is very rude

809
00:58:30,667 --> 00:58:33,042
Some called him a ladies' man!

810
00:58:33,667 --> 00:58:35,125
My theory is...

811
00:58:35,208 --> 00:58:37,917
...Shruti wanted to
complain against Fabian

812
00:58:37,958 --> 00:58:40,458
The 3 of them stick together
like 3 musketeers

813
00:58:40,458 --> 00:58:42,833
There is a possibility
of a name mix up

814
00:58:44,125 --> 00:58:46,125
This is from my personal experience

815
00:58:46,125 --> 00:58:47,917
'Even if they are
the best of friends...'

816
00:58:47,917 --> 00:58:49,958
'...they won't share
their dirty secrets'

817
00:58:51,208 --> 00:58:53,208
'Without Melvin and
Mano's knowledge...'

818
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:55,500
'...Fabian could have stalked Shruti'

819
00:59:13,125 --> 00:59:15,917
- Where are you going at this hour?
- To the police station, sir

820
00:59:17,833 --> 00:59:19,292
What happened to your face?

821
01:00:03,125 --> 01:00:06,083
Am I the only one in the dark
or are you as clueless?

822
01:00:06,583 --> 01:00:08,375
You usually have
a ready explanation

823
01:00:08,417 --> 01:00:09,500
What about this?

824
01:00:10,458 --> 01:00:12,208
How many times
have I told you?

825
01:00:13,917 --> 01:00:15,875
First stop getting flustered

826
01:00:15,917 --> 01:00:19,042
This isn't as serious
as you make it out to be

827
01:00:21,208 --> 01:00:25,833
Okay, listen to me without
interrupting or getting nervous

828
01:00:26,958 --> 01:00:29,833
Some chap has witnessed
our accident yesterday

829
01:00:34,917 --> 01:00:38,125
'After we fought, we ensured
the trunk was locked'

830
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:40,208
'But we didn't press
the central lock button'

831
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:42,625
'So he must have
followed our car'

832
01:00:42,667 --> 01:00:44,375
'And after we entered our house...'

833
01:00:44,417 --> 01:00:47,958
'...using the driver seat's lever
he must have got the body out'

834
01:00:47,958 --> 01:00:49,375
'Whoever did this...'

835
01:00:49,375 --> 01:00:51,083
'...is expecting a ransom from us'

836
01:00:52,875 --> 01:00:54,917
In case we refuse to oblige...

837
01:00:54,958 --> 01:00:57,750
...he'll be in the mindset to
take this matter to the police

838
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:00,500
Boss

839
01:01:00,708 --> 01:01:02,917
Need to talk to you in
private about something

840
01:01:02,917 --> 01:01:05,125
I have told you
we don't want newspaper

841
01:01:05,125 --> 01:01:07,625
Oh no! This isn't about
delivering the newspaper

842
01:01:07,667 --> 01:01:09,958
It's about your mug shots
in the News tomorrow!

843
01:01:15,417 --> 01:01:17,125
Boss, why are you standing?

844
01:01:17,125 --> 01:01:18,875
Sit down, this is
your house after all

845
01:01:18,917 --> 01:01:20,750
What is this private matter?

846
01:01:20,917 --> 01:01:22,292
You want to know, huh?

847
01:01:22,417 --> 01:01:26,667
Early this morning a newspaper boy
was cycling past our Bharathi park

848
01:01:32,083 --> 01:01:34,917
He suddenly heard the brakes
of a car screech to a halt

849
01:01:35,792 --> 01:01:38,250
When he got off his cycle
and rushed to check...

850
01:01:41,333 --> 01:01:43,125
...he saw 3 boys like you

851
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:46,667
Their car hit a guy, they threw him
into the trunk and they whizzed away!

852
01:01:53,667 --> 01:01:55,792
That newspaper chap is damn decent

853
01:01:55,833 --> 01:01:58,250
He hasn't informed
this matter to the police

854
01:01:58,292 --> 01:02:01,458
If I had been in his shoes I would
have informed the cops definitely

855
01:02:01,583 --> 01:02:04,375
Later an idea struck that chap

856
01:02:04,833 --> 01:02:07,000
If he shares this information
with the police...

857
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,833
...he won't be richer
even by a rupee

858
01:02:09,042 --> 01:02:11,792
Those boys will also be
behind bars unnecessarily

859
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:16,625
But if he meets the concerned culprits
and discusses terms with them...

860
01:02:16,667 --> 01:02:18,542
...and his wallet becomes fatter

861
01:02:18,583 --> 01:02:20,958
...then the benefit is mutual

862
01:02:21,333 --> 01:02:22,917
Do you agree with me, huh?

863
01:02:24,875 --> 01:02:26,250
How much?

864
01:02:27,708 --> 01:02:31,958
If I stay awake for a whole month
and deliver newspapers I'll save 3000

865
01:02:32,417 --> 01:02:36,042
For a year, 2 x 50 x-

866
01:02:36,667 --> 01:02:38,042
I can only save Rs 20000

867
01:02:38,375 --> 01:02:40,792
I'm now 29 years old

868
01:02:41,625 --> 01:02:44,542
For the next 40 years I'm hoping
I'll be alive and kicking

869
01:02:45,958 --> 01:02:49,417
If you place 1 million on this table...

870
01:02:49,458 --> 01:02:51,125
...I'll just grab the pile and scoot

871
01:02:51,458 --> 01:02:54,125
I won't face you ever again
What do you say?

872
01:02:55,958 --> 01:02:57,333
Come after 2 hours

873
01:02:57,417 --> 01:02:58,833
Money will be ready

874
01:02:59,125 --> 01:03:00,375
Can I trust you?

875
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:01,792
I give you my word

876
01:03:06,875 --> 01:03:09,833
When he blackmailed us
we should have thrown him out

877
01:03:09,833 --> 01:03:11,292
Why get scared of him?

878
01:03:11,583 --> 01:03:13,042
Think about it

879
01:03:13,375 --> 01:03:15,792
Are you sure
only he knows this?

880
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:17,583
Let's first give in
to his demand

881
01:03:17,625 --> 01:03:19,042
If he takes it
and keeps quiet...

882
01:03:19,083 --> 01:03:21,458
...then no one else
is aware of this for sure

883
01:03:21,708 --> 01:03:24,292
I know only too well
how to get back my money

884
01:03:25,458 --> 01:03:27,250
Until then just do what I say

885
01:03:27,333 --> 01:03:29,208
Don't chicken out
and die of fear

886
01:03:37,042 --> 01:03:37,833
Hello, dad

887
01:03:37,875 --> 01:03:40,500
- You withdrew from our account?
- Yes, I did

888
01:03:40,542 --> 01:03:43,792
To buy the property
near Tiruppur we decided on

889
01:03:43,833 --> 01:03:45,792
My salary hasn't been credited as yet

890
01:03:46,583 --> 01:03:48,125
I urgently need 1 million, dad

891
01:03:48,208 --> 01:03:49,833
Hey! Why so much?

892
01:03:54,833 --> 01:03:56,500
I have only 50,000 at the moment

893
01:03:56,542 --> 01:03:57,917
Will pay the balance later

894
01:03:59,667 --> 01:04:00,750
What is this, boss?

895
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:03,625
You promised 1 followed by 6 zeroes
and now it is 2 zeroes less!

896
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Okay, I'll adjust
What about the rest?

897
01:04:07,958 --> 01:04:10,833
I'll give the balance later
Come and collect it in a week

898
01:04:20,875 --> 01:04:22,333
'After we left the station...'

899
01:04:22,333 --> 01:04:24,542
'...he came again and
demanded money, sir'

900
01:04:24,917 --> 01:04:26,125
'After all it's an accident'

901
01:04:26,125 --> 01:04:28,000
'I said it is better to
confess to the cops'

902
01:04:28,042 --> 01:04:30,750
'Then we don't have to pay him
and we will also be safe'

903
01:04:31,708 --> 01:04:33,625
'Fabian got angry and hit me'

904
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:37,083
'I thought the police
should be informed of this'

905
01:04:37,125 --> 01:04:39,625
'That's why I came
without their knowledge'

906
01:04:39,708 --> 01:04:41,625
Where did the accident take place?

907
01:04:42,208 --> 01:04:43,500
Right here, sir

908
01:04:43,917 --> 01:04:45,292
How did he look?

909
01:04:45,375 --> 01:04:47,125
Can you recollect any details?

910
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:51,708
I was so petrified
nothing registered in my mind

911
01:04:57,375 --> 01:04:58,375
You leave now

912
01:04:58,417 --> 01:04:59,667
If your friends ask you...

913
01:04:59,708 --> 01:05:02,500
...act as if the cops are
unaware, I'll take care

914
01:05:04,625 --> 01:05:06,542
Sir, that newspaper man

915
01:05:07,625 --> 01:05:09,375
Hereafter he won't bother you

916
01:05:15,333 --> 01:05:16,333
1 minute

917
01:05:16,333 --> 01:05:20,042
Arrange the information we have
got so far in chronological order

918
01:05:21,958 --> 01:05:24,292
Last night Vaishnavi went
to the apartment at 11

919
01:05:25,958 --> 01:05:28,542
The accident was at 2:00 a.m

920
01:05:31,375 --> 01:05:34,125
Near the same park, same time,
Shruti's boyfriend was shot

921
01:05:37,292 --> 01:05:38,417
Then-

922
01:05:38,458 --> 01:05:41,625
At 7:00 a.m Vaishnavi has
complained to her neighbor

923
01:05:45,958 --> 01:05:48,250
She escaped at 10:00 p.m

924
01:05:51,458 --> 01:05:54,750
That newspaper chap
was there in the accident spot

925
01:05:54,792 --> 01:05:58,333
What are the possibilities he could
have witnessed the murder too?

926
01:05:58,333 --> 01:05:59,500
Plenty, sir

927
01:06:03,875 --> 01:06:05,458
'S.Marimuthu
Raghavendra street'

928
01:06:17,625 --> 01:06:18,792
Hello...!

929
01:06:19,292 --> 01:06:21,125
Won't you invite us in?

930
01:06:21,125 --> 01:06:22,375
Come in, sir

931
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:29,750
My clothes are strewn
all over the place

932
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,583
If you don't mistake me-

933
01:06:32,042 --> 01:06:33,458
What is this, sir?

934
01:06:33,708 --> 01:06:35,542
Sir, what are you doing?

935
01:06:36,458 --> 01:06:37,917
Why, sir-

936
01:06:40,083 --> 01:06:43,292
Even though it's a small place
he has maintained it very well

937
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:47,542
Don't stay here from now on

938
01:06:47,542 --> 01:06:50,917
There are very nice apartments
for 800,000 in Mettupalayam

939
01:06:50,958 --> 01:06:52,792
Better shift there

940
01:06:52,792 --> 01:06:55,917
With the balance 200,000
start something on your own

941
01:06:55,917 --> 01:06:57,417
Life will be very good

942
01:06:57,458 --> 01:06:59,333
I made a mistake
Please forgive me, sir

943
01:06:59,375 --> 01:07:01,375
I won't trouble
those boys again, sir

944
01:07:01,417 --> 01:07:03,667
I will confess
everything to you, sir

945
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:10,625
The word 'truth' has a meaning

946
01:07:10,667 --> 01:07:13,250
That is, to say what you saw exactly

947
01:07:13,292 --> 01:07:15,417
Shouldn't swallow some
and with the remainder...

948
01:07:15,458 --> 01:07:17,667
...shouldn't blackmail young boys

949
01:07:17,708 --> 01:07:20,667
If you can convince us
you are being 100% honest...

950
01:07:20,708 --> 01:07:23,333
...we'll leave without
even uttering a single word

951
01:07:23,792 --> 01:07:25,708
But in case it is not true...

952
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:28,583
...and if we think
you're lying to us

953
01:07:28,792 --> 01:07:31,333
...we'll tie you up
in the middle of the road

954
01:07:31,417 --> 01:07:34,042
I will ask those boys
to run their car over you!

955
01:07:34,208 --> 01:07:35,542
I'll confess, sir

956
01:07:37,042 --> 01:07:38,250
Tell me

957
01:07:38,292 --> 01:07:40,667
I was on my way to the depot
to collect the newspaper

958
01:07:40,708 --> 01:07:43,125
'A man was sprawled
on the road near a white car'

959
01:07:45,583 --> 01:07:48,292
'To check what had happened,
I went closer, sir

960
01:07:48,917 --> 01:07:50,958
'I am not that lame, okay?'

961
01:07:51,042 --> 01:07:52,958
'He had been shot'

962
01:07:55,667 --> 01:07:58,500
'If you call me names
I'll make mincemeat out of you'

963
01:07:59,792 --> 01:08:04,042
'I heard a car skid
on the opposite road, sir'

964
01:08:04,917 --> 01:08:07,042
'When I went to check
what happened...'

965
01:08:07,042 --> 01:08:12,250
'...the car hit a pedestrian, the boys
tossed him into the trunk and left'

966
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:21,625
'Immediately I went to the police station
and informed only about the gun'

967
01:08:21,667 --> 01:08:23,833
'I didn't utter a word
about the accident'

968
01:08:29,875 --> 01:08:32,042
I blackmailed those boys
only for money, sir

969
01:08:32,042 --> 01:08:34,583
I swear I don't know
anything else, sir

970
01:08:34,583 --> 01:08:36,875
So you didn't remove
that body from the trunk?

971
01:08:36,917 --> 01:08:39,042
What will I do
with a dead body, sir?

972
01:08:45,042 --> 01:08:47,125
Was it this car
you saw in the park?

973
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:49,125
Same car, sir

974
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:03,042
- You saw the car at the spot?
- No, sir

975
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:09,208
Does it take this long
to trace a car number?

976
01:09:09,292 --> 01:09:11,042
Come, just can't
trust these chaps

977
01:09:13,583 --> 01:09:16,917
Did constable Rajan give
a car number to trace?

978
01:09:16,958 --> 01:09:17,917
He did, sir

979
01:09:17,917 --> 01:09:19,750
- I've messaged the details
-To whom?

980
01:09:19,750 --> 01:09:21,542
Rajan sir
1 minute

981
01:09:22,542 --> 01:09:24,125
The message wasn't sent

982
01:09:24,292 --> 01:09:25,958
I'll check it right now

983
01:09:31,875 --> 01:09:34,458
The killer must have seen
these boys hit the man

984
01:09:35,125 --> 01:09:38,208
After they left, he must have
taken the car and followed them

985
01:09:38,375 --> 01:09:41,125
He must be the one who
removed the body from the trunk

986
01:09:41,750 --> 01:09:43,208
I thought of this too

987
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:45,375
But Vaishnavi lying to us

988
01:09:45,417 --> 01:09:47,125
Traces of blood
in the apartment

989
01:09:47,125 --> 01:09:48,542
What about all this?

990
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:51,583
'Visualize what I tell you now'

991
01:09:51,625 --> 01:09:55,250
'Can't confirm this is what
would have exactly happened'

992
01:09:55,417 --> 01:09:58,208
'With all the leads
we've received until now...'

993
01:09:58,250 --> 01:10:01,042
'...all I am saying is it could
have happened this way'

994
01:10:07,583 --> 01:10:09,833
'While they were
celebrating her birthday'

995
01:10:19,583 --> 01:10:22,208
'We don't know who he is'

996
01:10:28,833 --> 01:10:32,458
'There must have been
a third person in that apartment'

997
01:10:37,417 --> 01:10:40,125
'But as soon as the killer
enters the apartment...'

998
01:10:40,125 --> 01:10:42,042
'...the 3rd person assaults him'

999
01:10:44,625 --> 01:10:48,042
'He goes to Shruti's room
and assaults Krish'

1000
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,583
'Exactly at that time...'

1001
01:11:00,667 --> 01:11:02,917
'...Vaishnavi enters the apartment'

1002
01:11:03,708 --> 01:11:08,958
'He points the gun at her and threatens
to kill her if she squeals to anyone'

1003
01:11:09,375 --> 01:11:11,875
'Just to make others believe...'

1004
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,875
'...he leaves Vaishnavi out'

1005
01:11:13,875 --> 01:11:18,292
'He takes the 3 of them
at gun point with him in the car'

1006
01:11:18,583 --> 01:11:20,625
'When they are driving past the park...'

1007
01:11:20,667 --> 01:11:23,042
'...Krish must have tried to escape'

1008
01:11:33,708 --> 01:11:35,875
'Vaishnavi's boyfriend...'

1009
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:39,500
'...tries to escape by jumping
over the park fence'

1010
01:11:42,708 --> 01:11:45,917
'He frames Krish's death as suicide'

1011
01:11:47,917 --> 01:11:51,583
'What happened after this,
I don't have to explain'

1012
01:12:29,792 --> 01:12:35,125
'The newspaper man watches this
entire incident from outside the park'

1013
01:12:36,125 --> 01:12:39,792
'That killer watches the same
from inside the park'

1014
01:12:43,833 --> 01:12:45,500
'After these boys leave...'

1015
01:12:45,625 --> 01:12:49,458
'...the newspaper boy
rushes to the police station'

1016
01:12:55,708 --> 01:12:57,667
'Following Fabian's car...'

1017
01:12:58,458 --> 01:13:01,583
'...that killer leaves the spot too'

1018
01:13:02,708 --> 01:13:05,125
'After the boys enter their house...'

1019
01:13:05,125 --> 01:13:07,958
'...the killer removes the body
from the car trunk'

1020
01:13:15,292 --> 01:13:17,833
'Both the bodies have to be...'

1021
01:13:21,583 --> 01:13:23,833
'...in the white Dzire car
we are looking for'

1022
01:13:26,125 --> 01:13:28,458
Aren't my connections logical?

1023
01:13:30,333 --> 01:13:32,125
Chances are high
it happened this way

1024
01:13:32,125 --> 01:13:33,208
But what's the motive?

1025
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:35,958
There isn't any necessity
all murders should have a motive

1026
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,042
From your hint it seems like
we are chasing a psycho killer

1027
01:13:43,542 --> 01:13:45,542
Registered in the name
of Mr Krishnasamy

1028
01:13:49,292 --> 01:13:50,417
Hello, yes?

1029
01:13:50,417 --> 01:13:52,458
'Sir, I'm calling from
Tiruppur bypass'

1030
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:55,250
'A stranger just tossed something
from his car into a pond, sir'

1031
01:13:55,292 --> 01:13:56,292
Explain clearly

1032
01:13:56,333 --> 01:13:59,917
'He opened his car trunk and flung
something huge into the pond, sir'

1033
01:13:59,917 --> 01:14:01,083
What vehicle, sir?

1034
01:14:01,125 --> 01:14:02,208
'White Dzire, sir'

1035
01:16:40,875 --> 01:16:42,625
Leg needs to be amputated

1036
01:16:46,833 --> 01:16:48,208
'Few days ago...'

1037
01:16:48,250 --> 01:16:52,750
'...a youngster named Krish was found
mysteriously dead in Bharathi park'

1038
01:16:52,792 --> 01:16:56,125
'On the same day a girl
named Shruti went missing'

1039
01:16:56,292 --> 01:16:59,292
'A youngster called Mano
is the reason behind this'

1040
01:16:59,292 --> 01:17:02,292
'Since he was averse to the close
bond between Krish and Shruti'

1041
01:17:02,333 --> 01:17:06,208
'He shot Krish and
has kidnapped Shruti'

1042
01:17:06,250 --> 01:17:08,125
'According to police reports'

1043
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:12,708
'The police force is on
a witch-hunt for Mano'

1044
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:27,250
Sir, this is Rajan here

1045
01:18:28,375 --> 01:18:30,542
I was talking
for so long, Rajan

1046
01:18:30,750 --> 01:18:32,542
Sir, please don't mistake me

1047
01:18:33,292 --> 01:18:36,792
My son found out why
I asked you to meet him

1048
01:18:36,958 --> 01:18:38,792
He refused to meet you

1049
01:18:39,083 --> 01:18:41,125
Please don't take it to heart

1050
01:19:14,292 --> 01:19:15,875
Who are you?

1051
01:19:17,958 --> 01:19:20,375
You should've asked me this
right in the beginning

1052
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:23,417
You chatted with me as if
you knew me for 10 years

1053
01:19:24,625 --> 01:19:26,250
I played along

1054
01:19:27,333 --> 01:19:32,333
If I had revealed my true identity maybe
you wouldn't have opened up to this extent

1055
01:19:35,667 --> 01:19:37,625
So long to take out this?

1056
01:19:40,667 --> 01:19:42,292
I'm Krish's brother

1057
01:19:46,542 --> 01:19:47,583
Get inside

1058
01:19:47,708 --> 01:19:49,792
Don't come out
until I call you

1059
01:19:49,917 --> 01:19:50,958
Go inside

1060
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:56,667
I know you've seen
that murderer's face

1061
01:19:57,250 --> 01:20:00,333
But when the police questioned
you didn't divulge any information

1062
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:02,375
A man can control all his emotions

1063
01:20:03,125 --> 01:20:06,167
But after knowing this person
should be behind bars or dead

1064
01:20:06,208 --> 01:20:10,458
...if he is wandering scot free happily
a rage within will erupt you know

1065
01:20:11,875 --> 01:20:14,250
It's hard to control that anger

1066
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:16,875
Then only this...

1067
01:20:17,083 --> 01:20:19,542
...will help a lot of
people get justice

1068
01:20:20,458 --> 01:20:23,375
Even when you knew the killer,
you didn't do anything

1069
01:20:26,625 --> 01:20:27,958
Why...?

1070
01:20:28,250 --> 01:20:29,708
Let me tell you

1071
01:20:31,250 --> 01:20:33,333
If you are mad at me...

1072
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:35,833
...shoot me after I explain

1073
01:20:36,625 --> 01:20:38,833
No one will stop you

1074
01:20:40,667 --> 01:20:43,333
Policemen are a tad too arrogant

1075
01:20:43,375 --> 01:20:47,042
Need not be obligated for a lifetime
to someone who spared his life!

1076
01:20:48,792 --> 01:20:51,125
You should certainly
be aware of this

1077
01:20:59,375 --> 01:21:01,833
Why did you leave
without informing us?

1078
01:21:01,833 --> 01:21:04,542
I got a call from work asking me
to come immediately, sir

1079
01:21:04,583 --> 01:21:05,958
That's why I had to leave

1080
01:21:05,958 --> 01:21:09,792
Then I tried calling sir's cell
but it was switched off

1081
01:21:09,833 --> 01:21:11,917
Only now I heard about this

1082
01:21:13,958 --> 01:21:16,708
Did all this happen
when sir came in search of me?

1083
01:21:17,542 --> 01:21:18,583
No

1084
01:21:24,625 --> 01:21:26,208
Vaishnavi is here

1085
01:21:30,375 --> 01:21:31,583
Just a minute, sir

1086
01:21:31,625 --> 01:21:32,750
I'll get lunch for you

1087
01:21:42,125 --> 01:21:44,542
Sir, I didn't commit any mistake

1088
01:21:44,917 --> 01:21:47,417
I want to confess
the truth to you

1089
01:21:48,125 --> 01:21:50,375
After that whatever
decision you take...

1090
01:22:04,250 --> 01:22:05,542
Whom do you want to-

1091
01:22:06,292 --> 01:22:07,333
Shruti's friend

1092
01:22:07,375 --> 01:22:09,083
I came to wish her
for her birthday

1093
01:22:10,083 --> 01:22:11,958
No, she is inside
I spoke to her just now

1094
01:22:11,958 --> 01:22:13,500
She wanted to take a shower

1095
01:22:22,042 --> 01:22:24,042
Can I get you some juice?

1096
01:22:25,458 --> 01:22:26,875
What's his name?

1097
01:22:28,208 --> 01:22:29,708
He's my college friend, Prem

1098
01:22:30,833 --> 01:22:33,208
Haven't you planned
a birthday celebration?

1099
01:22:33,208 --> 01:22:35,792
We've planned something
without Shruti's knowledge

1100
01:22:45,667 --> 01:22:47,083
He lives in Nasik

1101
01:22:47,125 --> 01:22:49,375
But no one is aware
of his arrival today

1102
01:22:52,167 --> 01:22:54,208
How do you know Shruti?

1103
01:22:54,667 --> 01:22:56,917
We live in the same area
We talk quite often

1104
01:23:04,875 --> 01:23:07,542
Mano, please leave
before I behave harshly

1105
01:23:19,625 --> 01:23:21,458
Hey! I am talking to you-

1106
01:23:28,833 --> 01:23:30,958
Krish is my real name

1107
01:23:31,792 --> 01:23:34,625
I believe you went to
the police station yesterday?

1108
01:23:34,958 --> 01:23:37,333
I knew you'll attempt
something like this

1109
01:23:37,417 --> 01:23:40,375
That's why a month ago
when we first met...

1110
01:23:40,875 --> 01:23:42,708
...I introduced myself as Mano!

1111
01:23:45,958 --> 01:23:48,167
You haven't told me
your name as yet

1112
01:23:55,875 --> 01:23:57,333
Shruti and I need to talk

1113
01:23:57,375 --> 01:23:59,833
- Can you wait there?
- N...no

1114
01:23:59,958 --> 01:24:00,958
Go now

1115
01:24:05,625 --> 01:24:08,083
I might have met you
a few times to talk to you

1116
01:24:08,083 --> 01:24:10,208
But you didn't talk to me
even once properly

1117
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:13,958
Even I bided my time and
was patient beyond normal limits

1118
01:24:14,958 --> 01:24:16,958
I came here to wish you
on your birthday

1119
01:24:16,958 --> 01:24:21,167
Think you can yell at me and humiliate me
in front of all those people publicly?

1120
01:24:24,208 --> 01:24:25,458
That's all

1121
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:30,208
I thought of approaching you
with an excuse of love or relationship

1122
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:32,500
You won't allow a man
to be decent, right?

1123
01:24:32,750 --> 01:24:34,583
I believe he is also
in love with you

1124
01:25:08,875 --> 01:25:10,500
We need only Shruti

1125
01:25:10,708 --> 01:25:12,542
In your best interest
be silent

1126
01:25:44,042 --> 01:25:45,417
Hey! Get out

1127
01:25:59,792 --> 01:26:01,708
Listen carefully
all 3 of you

1128
01:26:06,625 --> 01:26:08,375
You get it, right?

1129
01:26:11,708 --> 01:26:14,250
In case you want to
get us caught by the Police...

1130
01:26:14,417 --> 01:26:16,125
...we have nothing to lose

1131
01:26:18,792 --> 01:26:19,958
But before that...

1132
01:26:19,958 --> 01:26:21,583
...think about this
at least once

1133
01:26:21,792 --> 01:26:23,583
What if you go viral?

1134
01:26:24,917 --> 01:26:26,708
Dude, when is my turn?

1135
01:26:30,333 --> 01:26:32,208
Her life is in our hands, dude

1136
01:30:46,708 --> 01:30:49,542
Don't panic
Just do what I say

1137
01:30:49,750 --> 01:30:52,250
After a while, knock on
your neighbor's door

1138
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:53,958
Tell him Shruti is missing

1139
01:30:54,625 --> 01:30:57,333
Come to the airport
after 10:00 p.m

1140
01:30:57,833 --> 01:31:00,792
Both of you stay in Nasik
till I let you know it's safe

1141
01:31:29,875 --> 01:31:32,958
In case you think I am lying

1142
01:31:47,458 --> 01:31:50,083
You've heard all that
you wanted to know

1143
01:31:50,458 --> 01:31:51,875
Tell me at least now

1144
01:31:51,917 --> 01:31:53,625
Who are you?

1145
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:58,375
Every single word I heard that day
is etched in my memory

1146
01:31:58,417 --> 01:32:03,417
Krish's father told us
he was his only son

1147
01:32:04,958 --> 01:32:06,250
Who are you?

1148
01:32:54,083 --> 01:33:01,917
'Police officer Mr Deepak and his recruit
Gautham were in an accident last night'

1149
01:33:01,917 --> 01:33:04,333
'Deepak who was severely injured...'

1150
01:33:04,333 --> 01:33:06,875
'...was forced to have
his right foot amputated'

1151
01:33:06,958 --> 01:33:10,292
'Since the vehicle had caught fire
during the accident...'

1152
01:33:10,292 --> 01:33:13,625
'...Gautham suffered
severe burn injuries'

1153
01:33:13,667 --> 01:33:17,708
'It is feared he might
have slipped into coma'

1154
01:33:25,125 --> 01:33:28,333
Gautham, can you hear me?

1155
01:33:30,792 --> 01:33:34,500
For the last 5 years
you've been asleep

1156
01:33:34,625 --> 01:33:37,375
In medical terms,
you were in coma

1157
01:33:37,417 --> 01:33:41,750
When you were admitted immediately
after the accident, this was your condition

1158
01:33:45,667 --> 01:33:47,292
Good news here is...

1159
01:33:47,292 --> 01:33:50,083
...we've grafted your face
without any scars

1160
01:33:50,083 --> 01:33:51,625
But the bad news is...

1161
01:33:51,667 --> 01:33:54,708
...we couldn't retain
your original facial features

1162
01:33:54,750 --> 01:33:57,042
Since you've been silent
the last 5 years...

1163
01:33:57,083 --> 01:33:58,875
...your voice has deepened

1164
01:33:58,917 --> 01:34:01,708
In short you won't be able to
recognize your own self

1165
01:34:31,583 --> 01:34:34,125
'In the hospital, when
I regained consciousness...'

1166
01:34:34,167 --> 01:34:36,375
'...the facts that stared back at me'

1167
01:34:36,375 --> 01:34:39,458
'Even if I want to, I cannot
go back to my old life'

1168
01:34:41,083 --> 01:34:43,833
'My dream for 24 years to be
a cop also came to a full stop'

1169
01:34:45,083 --> 01:34:47,958
'I was forced to live
half my 20s asleep'

1170
01:34:49,333 --> 01:34:52,333
'I was mad at the doctors
for saving me'

1171
01:34:52,917 --> 01:34:54,875
'But above all...'

1172
01:34:54,875 --> 01:34:58,458
'...I couldn't believe
or digest the News'

1173
01:35:05,167 --> 01:35:08,292
'From the time I heard that
I don't know why'

1174
01:35:08,292 --> 01:35:09,875
'Within me I had this'

1175
01:35:12,208 --> 01:35:16,792
'That's why I started looking for answers
as to why the case was still open'

1176
01:35:16,833 --> 01:35:19,583
'The one you respected
and encouraged'

1177
01:35:34,042 --> 01:35:36,875
Honestly it feels like
I'm talking to a new person

1178
01:35:38,625 --> 01:35:42,083
Whatever you asked me now,
you could've asked me directly, Gautham

1179
01:35:42,458 --> 01:35:45,958
I wonder what mistake I committed
for you to point a gun at me

1180
01:35:46,542 --> 01:35:49,125
I came 10 days ago
to ask you directly

1181
01:36:04,667 --> 01:36:09,667
'I had seen the same face
5 years ago in a white Dzire'

1182
01:36:12,625 --> 01:36:15,417
'What I hold today, I didn't
have on me the other day'

1183
01:36:17,250 --> 01:36:19,792
'I would've finished right then
the job I intend today'

1184
01:36:19,833 --> 01:36:23,375
I hope you now understand
why I'm pointing this gun at you

1185
01:36:23,417 --> 01:36:27,167
He erased 5 years
of my life and my identity

1186
01:36:27,167 --> 01:36:29,042
You knew this truth too

1187
01:36:29,042 --> 01:36:31,167
And yet, you chose
not to take any action

1188
01:36:32,292 --> 01:36:36,042
I'm not such a bad person to hold you
at gun point without any reason and talk

1189
01:36:36,083 --> 01:36:39,792
You are not that good a person to
let a criminal escape and save him

1190
01:36:42,292 --> 01:36:44,125
I believe I'll get it

1191
01:36:45,333 --> 01:36:47,958
What I'm doing now
may seem wrong to others

1192
01:36:47,958 --> 01:36:50,208
But I feel this is
the only right answer

1193
01:36:51,333 --> 01:36:53,042
I've come with a decision

1194
01:36:53,292 --> 01:36:55,125
Without any change whatsoever

1195
01:36:55,625 --> 01:36:57,625
You have to come out
with the truth

1196
01:36:57,958 --> 01:36:59,625
You have no other choice

1197
01:37:00,792 --> 01:37:01,833
Tell me, sir

1198
01:37:24,375 --> 01:37:25,417
Tell me, sir

1199
01:37:25,458 --> 01:37:28,458
'This is your last warning
Don't point the gun at him'

1200
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:37,958
Rajeev is my son!

1201
01:37:54,958 --> 01:37:57,333
'The fact that I have a girlfriend'

1202
01:37:57,375 --> 01:37:59,333
'And the reason I am
in Coimbatore now'

1203
01:37:59,750 --> 01:38:01,458
'My dad isn't aware of either'

1204
01:38:01,792 --> 01:38:03,875
'I lost my mom when
I was very young'

1205
01:38:06,792 --> 01:38:09,417
'This will come as a complete
surprise for you, dad'

1206
01:38:13,958 --> 01:38:17,875
"Wounds that leave scars behind"

1207
01:38:17,958 --> 01:38:21,917
"Undying moments borne in the mind"

1208
01:38:21,917 --> 01:38:25,792
"In the atrium of the heart, deep inside"

1209
01:38:25,875 --> 01:38:29,750
"Ablaze burning in every side"

1210
01:38:29,833 --> 01:38:33,750
"I gently rest in a peaceful state"

1211
01:38:33,792 --> 01:38:37,625
"As smoke I evaporate"

1212
01:38:37,708 --> 01:38:45,583
"In search of death’s lap
I seek an eternal nap"

1213
01:39:04,750 --> 01:39:09,125
"A blank sheet of paper"

1214
01:39:09,750 --> 01:39:13,792
"I turn into forever"

1215
01:39:13,875 --> 01:39:16,583
"Death has redrafted my fate clearly"

1216
01:39:16,583 --> 01:39:18,583
'After a while, knock on
your neighbor's door'

1217
01:39:18,625 --> 01:39:20,917
'Tell him Shruti is missing'

1218
01:39:20,958 --> 01:39:28,208
"Absolved of blame I resurrect slightly"

1219
01:39:28,833 --> 01:39:36,583
"When about to be snuffed totally
I glow as a light brightly"

1220
01:39:36,625 --> 01:39:40,250
"I gently rest to evolve"

1221
01:39:40,292 --> 01:39:44,042
"As smoke I dissolve"

1222
01:39:44,042 --> 01:39:48,875
"In search of sleep eternal
I recline on a lap unconditional"

1223
01:39:48,958 --> 01:39:51,875
'Someone was waiting in front
of your house for a long time'

1224
01:39:52,333 --> 01:39:53,375
'Who?'

1225
01:39:53,958 --> 01:39:56,292
'Must be around 6:00 p.m'

1226
01:39:56,333 --> 01:39:59,042
'I saw him when I was getting
back home from my walk'

1227
01:39:59,292 --> 01:40:02,125
'I don't know where
he went after that'

1228
01:40:03,250 --> 01:40:05,583
'Come to the airport
after 10:00 p.m'

1229
01:40:05,583 --> 01:40:08,292
'Both of you stay in Nasik
till I let you know it's safe'

1230
01:40:08,333 --> 01:40:10,958
'A stranger just tossed something
from his car into a pond, sir'

1231
01:40:10,958 --> 01:40:12,208
'Explain clearly'

1232
01:40:12,250 --> 01:40:15,750
'He opened his car trunk and flung
something huge into the pond, sir'

1233
01:40:15,750 --> 01:40:17,417
'What vehicle, sir?'

1234
01:40:19,458 --> 01:40:27,750
"That scent of death unpredictable
A moment of poignant poetry indelible"

1235
01:40:27,792 --> 01:40:31,042
'A personal scar in my son's life'

1236
01:40:31,083 --> 01:40:33,708
He can't erase it
even if he wants to'

1237
01:40:33,708 --> 01:40:35,792
'That's why he decided
to cover it up'

1238
01:40:37,583 --> 01:40:45,583
"With the purest last breath
I design my own death"

1239
01:40:48,500 --> 01:40:50,333
'Didn't I tell you
in the beginning?'

1240
01:40:50,375 --> 01:40:52,583
'Karma is a boomerang'

1241
01:40:53,833 --> 01:40:55,875
'However far you may hurl it...'

1242
01:40:55,917 --> 01:40:58,083
'...it will bounce back to us'

1243
01:40:58,708 --> 01:41:03,167
'Maybe if I had narrated my story
from Gautham's point of view...'

1244
01:41:03,208 --> 01:41:05,292
'...I would have been the villain'

1245
01:41:06,833 --> 01:41:08,875
'But did you notice something?'

1246
01:41:09,250 --> 01:41:11,333
'The reason my
life ended like this...'

1247
01:41:11,333 --> 01:41:14,417
'...is because of the decisions
I took at an emotional peak'

1248
01:41:14,708 --> 01:41:15,875
'In case...'

1249
01:41:16,167 --> 01:41:19,417
'...Shruti hadn't insulted Krish
in a moment of sheer hatred'

1250
01:41:20,083 --> 01:41:24,333
'In red hot rage, if Krish hadn't
commited that inhuman act'

1251
01:41:25,042 --> 01:41:28,750
'In a state of panic if Rajeev
hadn't murdered Krish'

1252
01:41:29,333 --> 01:41:33,542
'If I hadn't hidden all this truth
due to parental love and affection...!'

1253
01:41:34,125 --> 01:41:38,583
'Finally if Gautham hadn't shot me
for the sake of pure justice...'

1254
01:41:38,958 --> 01:41:42,458
'...life would have been
so different, right?'

1255
