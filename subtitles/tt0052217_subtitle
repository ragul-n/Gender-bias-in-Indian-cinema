3
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:04,320
Hey, Leela. Give it to me.

4
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:06,460
No, I won't. It's my bottle.

5
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,616
Don't you dare touch my things.

6
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,330
Who are you to stop me?
I will touch them.

7
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:14,070
Touch it and I'll break your teeth!

8
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:19,410
Geeta! Wait till I come out.
I won't spare either of you.

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,766
You'll break my teeth?
Take a look at your long face.

10
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,330
I've seen it. But I won't
give you the bottle, it's mine.

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,036
- Why did you take my ribbons yesterday?
- And why did you wear my earrings?

12
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,536
Why did you ask to wear my bangles
for the party the other day?

13
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,200
I only asked for your bangles.
Didn't you take something in return?

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,130
Don't you have to go to school?
Get ready quickly.

15
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,680
- She's fighting with me.
- She took my bottle of hair...

16
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,260
Hey. Pappu.

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,840
- What do I apply on my head now?
- My shoe.

18
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:54,060
- Geeta, I'll show you...
- Sis, she's hitting me! - Hey, Geeta! Leela!

19
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,290
You're testing my patience.

20
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,000
I'll teach you both a lesson
you won't forget. Get going!

21
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,470
- Laaj.
- Coming, father.

22
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,450
Where are you, my dear?
Please come downstairs.

23
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,240
Everything's kept there.

24
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,220
Pappu, what's this?
Where are your knickers?

25
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:22,960
Sister will bring them.

26
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:27,130
- Sister will bring them, indeed!
- Where's my cap?

27
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,430
Cap, my foot! You haven't worn
your knickers. Aren't you ashamed?

28
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,980
- My tie... I can't find my tie...
- What's this, then?

29
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,500
I can't do a thing without you,
can't even find my clothes.

30
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:51,940
I wonder what will happen to
this house once you get married.

31
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,850
Who'll look after
these children?

32
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,636
Get ready soon, father.
I'll keep breakfast ready.

33
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,360
Okay, my dear.
I'll be there soon.

34
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,620
- Ramu, Ramu...
- Here comes the storm.

35
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,810
- Ramu, give me my milk.
- No, give me first.

36
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:10,539
- No. Me, first.
- Not toast, silly, milk.

37
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,930
- Hurry up.
- I will, just wait. I'm human, not a machine.

38
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,210
- "I'm human, not..."
- Hey, Leela, you won't learn, will you?

39
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:25,580
- I won't drink milk today. - Leela...
- I won't drink milk today.

40
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:31,560
Pappu, you want to be an
engine driver? Then drink your milk.

41
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,650
Sister, daddy is trying
to fool me again.

42
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:45,030
Laaj, you've still not had breakfast? We'll
miss the fast train. Greetings, uncle.

43
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,296
- Greetings, my dear.
- Ramu, just attend to the children.

44
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,220
- Father, I've to leave. We're very late.
- Your breakfast, my dear...

45
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,380
Bye-bye, sister.

46
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:15,120
SIXTEENTH YEAR

47
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,130
Wow! That's fantastic.

48
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,210
Wow. Superb.

49
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,270
Hello.

50
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,780
I said 'hello'.

51
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:31,520
- Hello.
- Tell me, why did you come so late?

52
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,530
- We waited so much for you.
- Who asked you to wait?

53
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,490
Hey, what's wrong with you?

54
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,390
It looks like you
had a tiff with someone.

55
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,120
When you are sulky,
you look like a real monkey.

56
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:55,070
- Shyam, will you listen to me?
- What is it?

57
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:59,680
When you sulk, you look
exactly like a monkey.

58
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,540
I'm in no mood for jokes, Laaj.

59
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,620
Good Lord.
You think this is a joke?

60
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,230
Just look at your face
in the mirror...

61
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,230
you look really funny.

62
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,460
Laaj, come on.

63
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,590
- Come on, Shyam.
- You go. Don't bore me.

64
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,900
Is this a season
to sulk, crazy one?

65
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:58,250
The season of love
comes only by chance

66
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,470
Is this a season
to sulk, crazy one?

67
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,460
Look at the rains
shimmy and sway

68
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:34,130
I've let loose my damp curls

69
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,800
Listen to me, oh simple one

70
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:48,060
Oh my simpleton, listen...

71
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:58,660
Look, the season of Spring
doesn't stay forever

72
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:04,250
Is this a season
to sulk, crazy one?

73
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:09,300
The season of love
comes only by chance

74
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:14,440
Is this a season
to sulk, crazy one?

75
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,300
These songs of my heartbeats

76
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:44,960
The stories told
by loving glances

77
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,720
Do listen to these, oh crazy one

78
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:58,830
Oh crazy one, what would
you know of these?

79
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:09,500
Where will you find
such a tranquil age?

80
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:14,980
Is this any season
to sulk, crazy one?

81
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:20,010
The season of love
comes only by chance

82
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:25,110
Is this any season
to sulk, crazy one?

83
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,070
Please let your heart
unite with mine

84
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,630
Turn your eyes towards me

85
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,310
Oh beloved, drop it...

86
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:09,620
drop this pretence, my beloved

87
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:20,040
What if this season
of love passes us by?

88
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:25,530
Is this a season
to sulk, crazy one?

89
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:30,530
The season of love
comes only by chance

90
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:36,170
Is this a season
to sulk, crazy one?

91
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:53,680
- Laaj...
- Huh? He talks! Tell me.

92
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,940
- It would be best, for both our sakes...
- Yes? - ...to stop meeting.

93
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:00,310
Stop meeting? Okay.

94
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,560
And break-up forever.

95
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:06,150
Forever? Okay, that's
acceptable too.

96
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:09,550
Laaj, what's the point of us meeting
when we can't get married?

97
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,860
Who says... no, you're right.
There's no point at all.

98
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,340
Why don't you understand?

99
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:17,050
I'm stupid.
How can I understand?

100
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,346
Listen, Laaj.

101
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:21,810
It's wrong of us to meet when your
father hasn't consented to our marriage.

102
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,790
It's pointless,
it's wrong, Laaj.

103
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,440
Don't say that, Shyam.
You're breaking my heart.

104
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,100
We can't run away from the truth,
Laaj. We can never get married.

105
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,900
Then you tell me,
what do we do now?

106
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,300
What can I say, Laaj?

107
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,920
There's a solution...

108
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,130
but you cannot do it, Laaj.

109
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,250
Test me whenever you wish...

110
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,130
I can do anything
for you, Shyam.

111
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,050
Then, let's elope today, Laaj...

112
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,430
and get married somewhere else.

113
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:17,610
Shyam, I'm prepared
to go with you.

114
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:29,030
I don't understand a thing.
Doctor, what will happen to Laaj?

115
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:32,610
Shankarlal, will you listen to me
or just continue to talk? Sit.

116
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,940
The boy has agreed.

117
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,300
He's such a nice boy.
He said, "You're my elder.

118
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,380
I'll do exactly
as you say."

119
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:47,050
Shankarlal, it's very difficult
to find such boys nowadays.

120
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,560
It's not the boy
I'm thinking of, Doctor.

121
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,930
- But my daughter, Laaj...
- isn't Laaj like my daughter too?

122
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,480
I care for her too.

123
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,920
You just have to go to Bangalore
once to meet his mother.

124
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:07,500
I can go whenever
you want me to.

125
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,490
Go by plane tomorrow morning.

126
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:13,350
Talk to his mother, fix the marriage
and return the day after.

127
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,380
I'll give you a letter
of introduction to give her.

128
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,070
- Alright.
- Get ready to leave...

129
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,920
The boy and I will meet you
at the airport tomorrow morning.

130
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:26,300
I'd have brought him today itself
but he has the night shift.

131
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:29,370
But I also have to inform
Laaj of this matter.

132
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:33,630
There's no need to tell Laaj.
Whatever we're doing is for her good.

133
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,510
Hey, Pappu?

134
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:43,080
Sister, why are you so late?
I can't fall sleep.

135
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,290
I've come, now go to sleep.

136
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:21,910
My dear,

137
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,350
wake me up at 5 a.m.

138
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:29,500
I've to go to Bangalore
by the morning flight.

139
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:35,810
Listen.

140
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,410
Sit.

141
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:46,890
My dear.

142
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:52,470
It's possible that the decision
I'm making about your life...

143
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,580
may convince you that
I'm a bad person.

144
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:00,080
Perhaps you will even hate me.

145
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:06,470
But, my dear, all I
want to tell you is...

146
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,090
to have faith in me.

147
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,320
What I'm doing is
for your own good.

148
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,400
Go, my dear Go to sleep.

149
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:11,690
Laaj, did anyone
see you leaving?

150
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,010
No. But I'm scared, Shyam.

151
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,590
What's there to be afraid of? Everything
will be fine once we reach Delhi.

152
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:30,080
Please speak softly.
I hope he didn't hear.

153
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,670
You're unnecessarily worrying.
He's sleeping.

154
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:42,100
- What's in this?
- The necklace that I brought from home.

155
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,330
- Take care of it.
- Only a necklace?

156
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,666
- Yes. I didn't bring anything else.
- But, Laaj...

157
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:51,200
- how will one necklace suffice?
- It's very valuable, made of real pearls.

158
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,720
Mother used to say it's
worth Rs10,000.

159
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:59,890
I'm ashamed that I have to
take the necklace from you.

160
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:03,090
- I won't be able to sell it.
- There you go again.

161
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,980
When you have enough money,
buy me a new one.

162
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,200
Laaj, I'll just go
buy some cigarettes.

163
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,400
Buy them at Bombay Central.

164
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:25,430
It's available right here.
I'll be back soon.

165
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:28,360
- What if the train leaves?
- Don't worry, I'll be back in time.

166
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,540
One packet Capstan.

167
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:32,650
Why did you have to pull the chain?
I'd boarded the next car.

168
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:36,660
I didn't pull the chain.
Someone else must have.

169
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,960
Come on.

170
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,460
Laaj, you look very worried.

171
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:46,130
My heart skipped a beat when the
train moved and you hadn't returned.

172
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,720
Laaj, I was just buying cigarettes,
when the train left.

173
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,460
I couldn't reach this car.

174
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:56,570
For a moment I felt as if someone
had given me a rude shock.

175
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:00,910
I'll continue to be afraid
until we reach Delhi.

176
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,560
You've sent a telegram
to your family, haven't you?

177
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,410
Telegram?
What telegram?

178
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:10,980
To inform them of our arrival?
So they can meet us at the station?

179
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:14,600
Oh? To inform them we're coming?
I've already sent that.

180
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:18,210
Laaj, mother will be
very happy to see you.

181
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:21,090
You don't know my mother, Laaj.
She's great.

182
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:26,080
Some guys have all the luck.
Others don't even get crumbs.

183
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:29,060
Will I always remain a bachelor?

184
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,480
Just look at your face!

185
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,750
My parents find
my face adorable.

186
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:36,380
I wonder why girls look at me
and feel embarrassed.

187
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,166
Anyway, I'll surely find some
shameless woman or the other.

188
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,190
- What?
- Nothing.

189
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:45,080
Forget all that. Tell me about you.
What have you done?

190
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,800
- You have a nice face, right?
- Yes, thankfully. - Thankfully, indeed.

191
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:51,190
Then why doesn't
any girl like you?

192
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:53,150
Why don't you fall for someone?

193
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,140
What do I say about my heart?

194
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,720
Why?

195
00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:00,810
My heart is just a vagabond

196
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:14,440
My heart is just a vagabond

197
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:18,970
Who knows whom it will settle on

198
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:50,630
Pretty girls beckoned,
even embraced me

199
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,790
They tried to coax me
but my heart wouldn't listen

200
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,840
It's too innocent, poor thing

201
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:17,250
Who knows whom it will settle for

202
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,570
My heart is just a vagabond

203
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:26,200
Who knows whom it will settle on

204
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:48,770
My strange, crazed heart
has neither hearth nor home

205
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:52,830
It's estranged from the earth,
separated from the skies

206
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,820
My heart's a falling star

207
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,230
Who knows whom it will fall for

208
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:19,720
My heart is just a vagabond

209
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:24,170
Who knows whom it will settle on

210
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,700
It has seen the whole world.
It is everyone's refuge

211
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:50,860
But my heart remained mine,
never belonged to anyone else

212
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:08,870
This gypsy heart is on a journey

213
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,110
Who knows its journey's end?

214
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:17,620
My heart is just a vagabond

215
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:21,930
Who knows whom it will settle on

216
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:46,730
When I fell in love,
no priest could be found

217
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:50,760
My heart lost its gamble
just when it staked its all

218
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,620
Rejected by the whole world

219
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:13,090
Who knows if
it will ever find anyone

220
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:17,380
My heart is just a vagabond

221
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:21,900
Who knows whom it will settle on

222
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,790
Hey Gopi, have the
boy and girl left?

223
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:32,980
- Yes.
- Come on, let's follow them.

224
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:35,506
- Why?
- Why don't you understand?

225
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:38,630
This girl has stolen jewelry from
home and eloped with this guy.

226
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,000
We may get a sensational story
for our newspaper.

227
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:43,070
What do I care
about the story, huh?

228
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:47,200
Look Gopi, if I don't file a story today,
the editor will sack me.

229
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:50,090
Listen, I've some urgent work
at the National Studio,

230
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:51,850
- you follow them.
- Fine. I'll go then.

231
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,960
Two first class tickets
to Ahmedabad.

232
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,960
How long before the train leaves?

233
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,540
Only 3 minutes.

234
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:03,650
Why doesn't it leave?
I'm frightened to death.

235
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,840
When father wakes up in the
morning, what will he go through?

236
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:12,856
And who will get the children
ready for school?

237
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,290
You're worrying unnecessarily.

238
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,150
Once the train moves,
you will be fine.

239
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,400
My God, Laaj! Your doctor uncle...
Quick! Hide in the bathroom.

240
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:25,410
Wretched man.
Don't you dare touch me.

241
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:28,170
Wonderful! I save your life
and get threats in return?

242
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,570
- Stop that man.
- Which man?

243
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:32,769
That man who's running away.
Quick, I say!

244
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:38,990
Am I your servant? If you want my help,
beg me, request me, say 'please'.

245
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:42,849
May I ask who that man is?

246
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,459
Just stop him.

247
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:49,880
I'm not in favor of stopping a man
who can leave a beautiful girl like you.

248
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:34,180
He's vanished.
Absolutely disappeared.

249
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,760
Just like horns
from a donkey's head.

250
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:42,460
Actually, today's lovers love the girl's
jewelry more than they love the girl.

251
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:49,620
The man seems honest to me.
He left you and took what he wanted.

252
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:54,190
Anyway, what's the point
in crying over spilled milk?

253
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:10,460
You can't climb over
this railing without help.

254
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:12,330
I don't need your help.

255
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:14,570
Your wish.

256
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:22,400
Watching your attempt to climb these
railings reminds me of my college days.

257
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:24,770
What lively days.

258
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:32,340
When I returned late at night,
I'd climb my hostel walls this way.

259
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,830
It seems you've never
stayed in a hostel.

260
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:40,070
No wonder you can't climb
the railing. Total ignoramus!

261
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:44,836
For God's sake,
help me. Please.

262
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:47,320
That's more like it, no?
Come here.

263
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,820
He must have gone this way.

264
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:28,340
Sardar saab, did a man
hire a taxi here just now?

265
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:34,660
Everybody hires taxis here, sir.
But whom are you talking about?

266
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,906
I'm asking about the man who
hired the taxi ahead of yours.

267
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:41,110
It's night time.
Who can see clearly?

268
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,060
He... He was carrying a bag.

269
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,200
Miss, he was definitely
carrying something.

270
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:49,056
He came in a hurry,
sat in the taxi and left.

271
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,330
- Which way did he go?
- God alone knows.

272
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:56,570
Did you notice
the license number?

273
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,970
Number? No, sir, I didn't.

274
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:03,150
The taxi's model?
What model was it?

275
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:09,480
It was an Austin... uh, a Hillman...
It was some 'man'.

276
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,390
- Any other clue?
- I know the driver.

277
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:17,750
So then tell me where he lives,
where's his house?

278
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:23,040
I can tell you that, sir, but what's
the problem? He's a family man.

279
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:27,360
There's no problem, Sardar saab.
We're following his passenger.

280
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:30,270
Just tell me, when does he
return home?

281
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,850
It's time for him
to return the cab.

282
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:35,510
If he doesn't get a passenger,
he'll head straight home.

283
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,080
- Suppose he finds one, then?
- He may not return till tomorrow.

284
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:43,250
If you want to take a chance,
then come with me right now.

285
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,030
I'll show you his house.

286
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:46,890
That's great. Why didn't you
say so before?

287
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,680
Come, sir, come.
Let's take a chance.

288
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,770
Very well, sir.
Let's leave right away.

289
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:12,840
Forgive me, perhaps you... uh...
lost your friend because of me.

290
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,120
- What's your name?
- Nothing.

291
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:19,720
That's a nice name.
Where do you live?

292
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,550
- Nowhere.
- That's a nice place, too.

293
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:26,350
Who was that boy?

294
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,320
- I can't tell you anything.
- Then that's the best.

295
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,460
Where were you going with him?

296
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,440
To hell.

297
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:40,730
If there are beautiful girls like
you in hell, may I come there?

298
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:45,810
My name is Kashyap.
Prannath Kashyap.

299
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:49,060
- I have no desire to know.
- But I yearn to tell you.

300
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:51,770
My name is old-fashioned,
but meaningful.

301
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:55,510
If you wish, you may
call me 'Nath' (Lord).

302
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:57,510
Okay?

303
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:01,840
Are you driving a taxi or a goods train?
Can't you go faster?

304
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:05,840
I drive a taxi, miss, not an aeroplane.
How can I drive faster than this?

305
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,300
Absolutely right, Sardar saab.

306
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,990
Don't go above 30mph or
the cops will give you a ticket.

307
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:14,400
Even if you get a ticket,
I'm willing to pay the fine.

308
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:18,350
Sardar saab, a sensible man will
rarely trust a woman's word.

309
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,070
- But, it's your call.
- Well said, sir.

310
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:25,280
- You're absolutely right. How can I believe you, miss?
- Hey, careful!

311
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:35,680
Anyway, forget all this.
At least tell me his name.

312
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,990
- Whose?
- The one who absconded.

313
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,890
I can't tell you anything.

314
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,490
What's your name? Nothing.
Where do you live? Nowhere.

315
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,840
Whom are you pursuing?
I don't know.

316
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:51,870
At least, madam, let me know what
the matter is... what your stories are...

317
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:57,000
- Driver, how much further?
- Just a little further, miss.

318
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,561
- How much did the necklace cost?
- It was very expensive.

319
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:10,200
Necklace? What necklace?
I don't know what you're talking about.

320
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,940
The one with which
that boy absconded.

321
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:15,660
I couldn't hear its price
in the local train.

322
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,201
- He didn't absond with the necklace.
- Then why are you pursuing him?

323
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,960
I have some urgent work
with him.

324
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:28,690
Fortunate indeed is that boy whom
a beautiful girl like you is pursuing.

325
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:35,000
My tragedy is that I have
run after girls all my life.

326
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,180
But no girl has ever
run after me.

327
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,040
Anyway, forget that.

328
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:43,860
What work do you have with
that respectable man?

329
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:45,840
- What's it to you?
- Nothing.

330
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:53,030
I simply want to know if I'm...
running with a thief or after one.

331
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:58,070
Think whatever you want.

332
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:08,690
- Please wait, sir. I'll go and enquire.
- Very well.

333
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:21,766
- Greetings!
- Greetings.

334
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:23,720
Has Banta Singh returned?

335
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:26,740
Please sit. He'll come soon.

336
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:31,330
- Who are those two love birds?
- Do be quiet. They're my passengers.

337
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,940
Why do you look so worried?

338
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:45,290
- Why, what's the matter?
- Shh...

339
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:50,430
The problem is that the boy
doesn't know the girl.

340
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,080
They're pursuing someone.

341
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:58,190
From their conversation, I gathered
that a necklace has been stolen.

342
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:03,380
What if it becomes a police case?
I wanted to ask you what I should do.

343
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:07,810
Why should you be afraid?
Go ask the boy who the girl is.

344
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:11,580
If he doesn't answer, call me.
I'll take them to the police station.

345
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:14,970
Okay, that seems best.
I'll go ask him who the girl is.

346
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:19,620
Sir, Banta Singh hasn't returned.
He should be on his way.

347
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,290
Sir, would you please
come out for a moment?

348
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:36,180
- What's the matter, Sardarji?
- It's very hot.

349
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:39,300
It's hot? You called me out
to say this?

350
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:42,470
Listen, please come
over here for a minute.

351
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,280
It's like this...
I'm a little suspicious.

352
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:53,560
- Look sir, I'm a poor taxi driver...
- Yes? - ...and I...

353
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:55,390
Yes, what is it, Sardarji?

354
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:57,430
- Let me ask you one question.
- Ask two.

355
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:01,450
Who is she?

356
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:08,450
Sardarji, she is a...
uh... a girl.

357
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:12,730
A girl? Even I know that.
But who is she?

358
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:14,430
- She's that one.
- That one?

359
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,600
- The one.
- The one? - Yes.

360
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:23,170
She's the one, indeed...
it is she

361
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:34,710
Look, look at her carefully

362
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:42,880
She's the one, indeed...
it is she

363
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:54,630
You must have heard this tale
in the village square

364
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:59,240
That a king was trapped
in a fairy's spell

365
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:16,476
That fairy has returned
with a new face

366
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:20,860
Look, look at her carefully

367
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:24,730
She's the one, indeed, it is she

368
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:53,950
You may remember
what the poets have said

369
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:58,570
Folks with innocent faces
may yet be executioners

370
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,900
They have no hearts but those
that are made of stone

371
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:20,240
Look, look at her carefully

372
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:24,050
She's the one, indeed, it is she

373
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,950
She is the one for whom
Farhad gave his life

374
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:53,540
In whose memory, weeping,
Majnu roamed the jungles

375
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:10,800
Romeo breathed his last
in her desire

376
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:15,080
Look, look at her carefully

377
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:18,640
She's the one, indeed, it is she

378
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:47,900
You may call this a joke,
but it's true

379
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:52,480
There's something that makes her
wander the streets with me

380
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:09,520
What more can I say?
You've to understand the rest

381
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:13,760
Look, look at her carefully

382
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:17,510
She's the one, indeed, it is she

383
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,830
- Yes, that's the one.
- Who? The boy with the bag?

384
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:27,700
- Yes, he.
- I dropped him off at National Studio.

385
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:30,570
- Then, Sardarji, please take us there.
- Please sit.

386
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,860
You? Here?
At this hour?

387
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,930
What can I do, my love?
I can't stay away from you.

388
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:55,490
I'd warned you earlier, too,
not to come to the studio.

389
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,000
You will surely malign me.

390
00:48:58,130 --> 00:49:02,660
I've told you often enough
to quit films and marry me.

391
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:06,830
I've no desire
to starve to death.

392
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:08,910
I'll keep you like a queen.

393
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,640
You only know how to talk.

394
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:16,770
I'd told you, some day, I would
erase all your grievances.

395
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,900
Close your eyes.
Please?

396
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:33,230
These are real pearls. Do you
know their worth? Rs10,000.

397
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:40,810
- How much is it?
- Re.1 and 3 annas.

398
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:45,310
Re.1 and 3 annas. Here's Rs5.
Give the rest to the other Sardarji...

399
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:47,710
- in whose taxi we came to your house.
- Okay.

400
00:49:57,310 --> 00:49:59,310
Please wait here.
I'll look for him in the studio.

401
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:01,440
He shouldn't spot you
and hide somewhere.

402
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:04,230
Don't worry, I'll be back soon.

403
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:12,400
You don't know these nice girls;
they will die before they breathe a word.

404
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:15,750
If you ask me, she must have
returned home by now...

405
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:17,890
and must be crying
her heart out.

406
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:22,890
Still, Shyam, keeping this
necklace with us is dangerous.

407
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:26,670
Why don't we sell it
and with the money...

408
00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:28,780
Get married, right?

409
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:30,980
I know a jeweler.

410
00:50:39,310 --> 00:50:42,800
Excuse me, sir, does a Mr. Shyam
work in this studio?

411
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:46,280
The time? I have no watch.

412
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:49,660
I'm asking about Mr. Sham,
not the time.

413
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:52,650
- Give me a matchbox.
- A matchbox?

414
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:57,490
Matches? Oh, yes, matches.
Here, take them.

415
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:00,390
Yes, take it in your hand.

416
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:04,260
- Give me a cigar.
- I don't have a cigar. I've cigarettes.

417
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:06,620
- Give me a cigar.
- Here, take a cigarette.

418
00:51:07,590 --> 00:51:09,290
Take the cigarette also
in your hand.

419
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,620
As I was saying, sir,
I'm looking for a man.

420
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:28,160
You're looking for a job? There are
no jobs here. Search elsewhere.

421
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:31,900
Not a job. I'm looking for a boy.

422
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:34,100
A girl? Is she beautiful?

423
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:37,200
Not a girl. A boy!

424
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:43,250
Hey, sir, why do you get angry?
I'm slightly hard of hearing...

425
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:45,110
Which department
does he work in?

426
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:50,920
Ah, now you're talking! I don't know
the department, but he's in the studio.

427
00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:52,810
Search Stage No. 2.

428
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:55,200
- Where?
- Find it.

429
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:58,490
Where is this Stage No. 2?

430
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,740
My name?
My name is Motiram.

431
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:06,920
I'm not asking your name. I'm asking
about Stage No. 2. Where's it?

432
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,510
- Go there.
- Then say so.

433
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:31,290
Mr. Motiram, get me through
to this number.

434
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,960
There's been no call for you.

435
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,790
- Uff! I didn't ask about incoming calls.
I want to make a call.

436
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,760
Yes, I heard. Which number
do you want?

437
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:19,320
Hey, forget that. Come in.

438
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:29,600
Kashyap, what are you
doing here?

439
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:31,620
And whose picture
were you taking?

440
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:35,460
I needed some snaps of the shooting
for my newspaper, that's why I'm here.

441
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:38,500
- But what are you doing here?
- I'm stuck in a strange dilemma.

442
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,400
Remember that couple sitting
behind us in the train?

443
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:43,760
- That Romeo and Juliet?
- Yes, the very same.

444
00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:46,060
That Romeo absconded
with Juliet's necklace.

445
00:53:46,610 --> 00:53:50,160
Absconded? Weren't they
eloping together on the train?

446
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:54,550
- How did the girl get left behind?
- Today's Romeos don't stay for long.

447
00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:59,540
Hmm, so what? If Romeo absconds with
the necklace, you elope with Juliet.

448
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,610
- But where is she?
- She's waiting outside.

449
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:06,240
Outside? Okay... sorry...
I'll be back soon.

450
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:09,100
It's a joke for you;
that poor girl is terrified.

451
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:10,240
So?

452
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:14,080
I've learned the boy has come to this
studio with the necklace.

453
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:17,370
- To the studio?
- Yes, do one thing. Somehow, find him...

454
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,410
- and keep an eye on him. I'll fetch the police.
- Okay.

455
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:22,430
You fetch the police.
I'll leave.

456
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:26,230
- Joking again?
- No, you get the police, I'll find him.

457
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:28,230
- Happy now?
- Yes.

458
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:48,450
- Any news?
- Nothing. I tried my best.

459
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:52,340
It's such a big studio. He may
be hiding inside. Come along.

460
00:54:52,570 --> 00:54:53,940
- Where?
- Police station.

461
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:59,690
- Police station?
- Yes, it's impossible to find him without the police's help.

462
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:03,710
The police will search the studio
and arrest him if he's inside.

463
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:05,770
- Come. Let's not waste time.
- Please wait.

464
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:10,540
Why go to the police for such a
petty matter? It's a waste of time.

465
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:14,630
Amazing. That man has
run away with your necklace...

466
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:16,660
and you don't even want to
report it to the police.

467
00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:20,900
If you didn't want the necklace back,
why did we run around so much?

468
00:55:21,170 --> 00:55:22,870
You wasted my time, too.

469
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:31,690
I apologize for the trouble
you went through for me.

470
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:36,300
Look, that's not the issue.
You seem to be from a decent family.

471
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:41,250
And you're in trouble. Believe me,
I want to help you get out of it.

472
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,280
Please tell me - what's all this?

473
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:46,600
I can't say anything,
can't tell you anything.

474
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:50,580
Listen!

475
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:57,680
Then let me take you home. It's late,
and it's not right for you to go alone.

476
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:01,350
Don't worry about me.
I'll go home on my own.

477
00:56:01,430 --> 00:56:04,330
- But... alone... so late...
- I told you I don't want to go with you.

478
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,660
Let me go.

479
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:13,610
Whatever I'm doing
is for your own good.

480
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:18,010
Sister, where did you go so late?
I couldn't fall sleep.

481
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,190
I can't do a thing without you.

482
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:23,630
You seem to be a girl
from a decent family.

483
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:37,850
What will happen to this house
when you get married?

484
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,940
Hey, mister, what's happening?

485
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:24,680
Nothing, constable. She
slipped on the staircase and fell.

486
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:29,390
- What's the problem?
- Problem? Nothing, constable. We live close by.

487
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:33,790
We came out for a stroll. Fact is,
she's been unwell for awhile...

488
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:36,340
- and she felt dizzy, and fell down.
- Fell? - Yes.

489
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:40,200
- Who are you?
- Me? I am... we are...

490
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:42,200
Er... she's my wife.

491
00:59:42,410 --> 00:59:46,610
- And I'm Prannath. - Who?
- Her Prannath.

492
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:50,820
- Who are you?
- He's our constable, the constable.

493
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,640
He was just asking about you.

494
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:58,120
- Nath? - Nath?
- She always calls me Nath. That's why.

495
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:02,610
Take her home quickly
or she'll catch a cold.

496
01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:04,410
Yes, I agree. You go.

497
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:10,630
I was afraid you'd do something
like this. That's why I followed you.

498
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:15,550
Why did you rescue me? lt'd
have been better if I had died.

499
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:18,360
How can I face father?

500
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:24,590
No. I won't go home.
I can't face father.

501
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:30,590
I'll die. I won't go home. Let me drown.
Let me go. Let me drown.

502
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:34,850
- What are you doing?
- I told you I won't go home. Let me go.

503
01:00:34,910 --> 01:00:36,580
- I won't go.
- No?

504
01:00:54,510 --> 01:00:55,710
Sit here.

505
01:01:02,530 --> 01:01:05,660
If you were to die like this,
how would your father face the world?

506
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:08,690
Committing suicide doesn't
solve your problems.

507
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:13,350
- I hope you aren't hurt?
- No.

508
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:19,020
When father finds out about all this,
what will he go through?

509
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:22,450
People in the neighborhood
will make my life difficult.

510
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:26,400
Don't worry. Everything will
be fine. Who was that boy?

511
01:01:27,210 --> 01:01:29,810
Why did you run away with him?
What's his name?

512
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:36,500
Shyam. Shyam Khanna.

513
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:43,380
Father was going to fix my marriage
elsewhere, and I loved Shyam.

514
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:47,400
I believed his lies
and left home.

515
01:01:49,190 --> 01:01:51,340
I took the necklace from home
at his behest.

516
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:57,440
How was I to know he
would deceive me like this?

517
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:01,840
Damn. Why hasn't he
come yet?

518
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:10,110
I don't understand
where he might be.

519
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:13,970
I'll phone him again.

520
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:18,550
It's 11:45 now.

521
01:02:19,330 --> 01:02:21,910
You have to awaken your father
at exactly 5a.m.

522
01:02:22,690 --> 01:02:26,070
If we try our best, it won't be
difficult to find him by then.

523
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:28,910
If we don't find the necklace,
how will I go home?

524
01:02:31,770 --> 01:02:33,370
Finding the necklace is my job.

525
01:02:47,390 --> 01:02:50,700
- Greetings.
- Greetings, sir. What's the matter?

526
01:02:50,950 --> 01:02:53,620
We are a bit... drenched.

527
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:58,130
It's not raining, sir.
How did you get drenched?

528
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:00,070
Well, it so happened we...

529
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:06,420
we were walking, and someone
threw water from above us.

530
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:09,190
And we were drenched. Right?

531
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:14,710
It looks like they threw
a lot of water on you.

532
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,950
Please have these clothes
dried and ironed quickly.

533
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:23,120
And until then, please give us
something else to wear.

534
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:33,390
Sir, it will cost a rupee each
to have them dried and ironed.

535
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:37,700
Sure. Charge a rupee each.
Here's two rupees.

536
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:41,400
- They're wet. Dry them too.
- Here, Sawariya.

537
01:03:41,930 --> 01:03:44,390
And listen... bring them
something to wear.

538
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:51,300
I'm freezing to death.

539
01:03:51,910 --> 01:03:54,070
Before jumping in,
you should have checked...

540
01:03:54,170 --> 01:03:56,540
to see if the water
was cold or warm.

541
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:04,280
Here, sir, clothes for both
of you. Go inside and change.

542
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:06,670
- Together?
- No, nearby.

543
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:09,540
What I mean is, a curtain...
in the middle.

544
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:21,320
- Here?
- Yes.

545
01:04:22,890 --> 01:04:26,030
- And you?
- You... here.

546
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:29,100
And I...

547
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,930
will be here.
Is that okay?

548
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:36,260
It'll have to do.

549
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:40,360
You haven't told me your name.

550
01:05:43,430 --> 01:05:47,190
- I am Laaj.
- 'Laaj'(shy)? Is that why you're always overcome by shyness?

551
01:05:48,970 --> 01:05:52,250
You do remember
my name, don't you?

552
01:05:54,020 --> 01:05:56,260
Your parents have
named you incorrectly.

553
01:05:56,970 --> 01:05:59,900
You should have been named
Hemant Kumar (the singer) instead.

554
01:06:02,660 --> 01:06:05,210
Tell me, where did you
learn to sing?

555
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:09,020
- Did you like it?
- Yes. Somewhat.

556
01:06:10,150 --> 01:06:14,350
Tell me, why were you making
faces at me while singing?

557
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:16,780
I was very angry.

558
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:18,320
And now?

559
01:06:19,730 --> 01:06:21,030
I don't know.

560
01:06:22,990 --> 01:06:24,390
Who's there at home?

561
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:29,550
No one right now,
but very soon...

562
01:06:29,590 --> 01:06:30,990
Will your family arrive?

563
01:06:32,180 --> 01:06:36,420
You're amazing. Here I am, still
unmarried, and you talk of children?

564
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:42,190
Fact is, I've never met a girl
whom I wanted to marry.

565
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:45,740
I'm sorry, I thought
you were married.

566
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:49,900
So tell me, why
haven't you married yet?

567
01:06:51,170 --> 01:06:55,450
What to do? I never fell in love.
But, now...

568
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:59,200
- Now what?
- I've begun to like someone.

569
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:02,550
- Who is she?
- There is someone.

570
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:05,860
- How is she?
- She is beautiful...

571
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:07,710
but a bit temperamental.

572
01:07:08,750 --> 01:07:11,920
- How long have you known her?
- She's a recent acquaintance.

573
01:07:16,860 --> 01:07:18,260
Where does she live?

574
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:21,620
She used to live elsewhere before,
but now, she resides in my heart.

575
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:25,860
Fortunate is that girl
who resides in your heart.

576
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:29,030
But the fun begins only when
I reside in her heart as well.

577
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:32,760
Why don't you ask her?

578
01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:35,680
I told you she's a bit
temperamental, so I'm slightly...

579
01:07:37,530 --> 01:07:40,040
- scared.
- You're a coward?

580
01:07:41,470 --> 01:07:42,870
She won't eat you.

581
01:07:44,070 --> 01:07:45,270
Who knows?

582
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:43,000
Look at my predicament

583
01:08:43,229 --> 01:08:45,439
My gait has changed

584
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:56,450
Look, I've turned sixteen

585
01:09:29,850 --> 01:09:32,490
When I look at the moon
and the stars, dear sir

586
01:09:32,590 --> 01:09:34,500
I have no control

587
01:09:34,790 --> 01:09:38,590
Seems like the Spring nights
have spread their magic

588
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:39,860
Really?

589
01:09:52,130 --> 01:09:54,400
This transient youth...

590
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:56,640
is strangely intoxicating

591
01:09:56,910 --> 01:10:00,830
Crazed by the whispers of Spring

592
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:03,450
They spoke of my predicament...

593
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:10,170
my wayward tresses

594
01:10:10,350 --> 01:10:14,370
Look, I've turned sixteen

595
01:10:50,690 --> 01:10:53,130
When I walk the path alone

596
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:55,250
Thousands of handsome young men

597
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:59,650
Cry out, 'take our hearts
oh doe-eyed one'

598
01:10:59,740 --> 01:11:00,940
I see!

599
01:11:12,660 --> 01:11:14,990
Snapping the strings of reason

600
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:17,210
The fair lady stepped out

601
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:21,710
so furtively.
Why, oh doe-eyed one?

602
01:11:21,830 --> 01:11:24,120
This straightforward gait...

603
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:30,950
has become wayward

604
01:11:31,070 --> 01:11:34,640
Look, I've turned sixteen

605
01:12:11,740 --> 01:12:14,180
I was innocent

606
01:12:14,450 --> 01:12:16,320
Till his intoxicating...

607
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:20,750
eyes cast its spell
despite my tears

608
01:12:31,710 --> 01:12:33,270
Beware, fair lady

609
01:12:33,550 --> 01:12:35,810
The world is crazy about you

610
01:12:36,050 --> 01:12:37,930
As you meet their gaze...

611
01:12:38,190 --> 01:12:42,260
or step towards them,
tread carefully

612
01:12:42,450 --> 01:12:44,810
'Tis a wondrous age...

613
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:51,420
the age of understanding

614
01:12:51,610 --> 01:12:55,570
Look, I've turned sixteen

615
01:13:32,140 --> 01:13:34,480
The ways of men are shabby

616
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:36,660
Their gaze, deceitful

617
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:40,910
And on their lips are false
pledges of love

618
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:42,250
Understood, sir?

619
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:55,990
Forget these tales, fair one

620
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:58,120
Look how beautiful is...

621
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:02,640
this season of intoxication,
this night of love

622
01:14:02,740 --> 01:14:05,110
Those with whom I share
my plight...

623
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:11,620
they lay the snare

624
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:14,930
Look, I turned sixteen

625
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:19,960
Look, she has turned sixteen

626
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:46,780
How long have you
known this washerwoman?

627
01:14:50,370 --> 01:14:52,470
I saw her for the first time
in my life today.

628
01:14:53,370 --> 01:14:56,280
Oh? So that's why you mingled so
closely with her and sang along.

629
01:15:00,950 --> 01:15:03,100
I was singing to entertain you.

630
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,600
I was also watching the person
who was being entertained by you.

631
01:15:15,650 --> 01:15:20,110
This washerwoman was very pretty,
and she dances like lightning.

632
01:15:20,230 --> 01:15:21,630
What do you think?

633
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:27,030
Let me ask you, sir, do you do
anything else in life other than sing?

634
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:29,480
At times, you're singing
in a moving train...

635
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:32,430
sometimes in front of taxi drivers
or with washerwomen

636
01:15:33,230 --> 01:15:34,730
Have you no 'laaj' (shame)?

637
01:15:36,330 --> 01:15:39,460
If this 'Laaj' would come into my life,
what more could I ask for?

638
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,170
The fact is, since I first saw you,
I feel like...

639
01:16:01,870 --> 01:16:03,180
singing forever.

640
01:16:06,870 --> 01:16:11,330
Who told you that only songs
can express what the heart feels?

641
01:16:14,450 --> 01:16:16,250
It's not about conversation;
this is business.

642
01:16:17,390 --> 01:16:18,690
Where's the necklace?

643
01:16:21,290 --> 01:16:23,000
The necklace is still
with that fool.

644
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:27,080
He wants to sell it to you
and marry me.

645
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:31,900
All my sympathies are with him.

646
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:34,300
Listen.

647
01:16:50,130 --> 01:16:53,450
Shyam, meet him.
He's Mr. Biharilal,

648
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:55,450
the city's most eminent jeweler.

649
01:16:57,770 --> 01:16:59,680
- I met him here.
- Please sit.

650
01:17:01,930 --> 01:17:04,640
Mr. Shyam, do you also
work in films?

651
01:17:04,770 --> 01:17:06,640
No, I... What do I say?

652
01:17:09,050 --> 01:17:12,360
The truth is, Mr. Biharilal,
the necklace I referred to...

653
01:17:12,590 --> 01:17:15,690
during our telephone call,
belongs to him.

654
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:18,150
And he wants to sell it.

655
01:17:18,590 --> 01:17:20,200
I thought it's such
a beautiful piece...

656
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:22,200
why not sell it to you?

657
01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:24,760
It's very kind of you to...

658
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:27,500
have so much respect for me.

659
01:17:28,850 --> 01:17:30,150
Where's the necklace?

660
01:17:33,290 --> 01:17:34,590
Here it is.

661
01:18:00,670 --> 01:18:02,710
You definitely know how to
fool someone, Miss Neena.

662
01:18:03,450 --> 01:18:04,830
Your performance is fantastic.

663
01:18:05,940 --> 01:18:07,540
Now show me the real necklace.

664
01:18:09,210 --> 01:18:11,870
- Real one?
- This is the genuine piece.

665
01:18:14,510 --> 01:18:17,410
Mr. Shyam, you said
you don't work in films.

666
01:18:18,350 --> 01:18:19,860
And you're acting too?

667
01:18:21,180 --> 01:18:24,250
- This necklace is made of fake pearls.
- Fake pearls?

668
01:18:24,550 --> 01:18:27,670
How can that be? This is
valued at Rs.10,000.

669
01:18:29,210 --> 01:18:31,830
Mr. Shyam, this isn't worth
even 10 cowries (shells).

670
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:40,500
Mr. Biharilal, perhaps you made
a mistake in testing this?

671
01:18:41,820 --> 01:18:43,570
Hmm... perhaps, after this,
you will say...

672
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:45,760
that all my life, I've been dealing
not with diamonds,

673
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:48,090
but with pebbles.

674
01:18:49,780 --> 01:18:53,020
My dear sir, I can spot
a gem anywhere.

675
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:59,320
But when it is a pebble,
how can I say it's a diamond?

676
01:19:01,050 --> 01:19:02,820
My only regret is that...

677
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:05,750
the pearl I was
sizing up at home,

678
01:19:07,060 --> 01:19:08,660
I may have lost that deal.

679
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:14,040
Anyway, Miss. Neena, I can
do anything for you.

680
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:16,816
I'll leave.

681
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:19,910
Don't. The necklace
is fake? Neena?

682
01:19:23,390 --> 01:19:24,800
I'll show him out.

683
01:19:58,050 --> 01:20:00,331
As far as I'm concerned, this is
a genuine pearl necklace.

684
01:20:08,530 --> 01:20:11,550
Madam, the shot is ready.
Please wear the dance costume.

685
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:15,780
Yesterday, I gave such a great shot
that Mehboob saab was speechless.

686
01:20:15,980 --> 01:20:20,160
Then, what can I say? He shot
a scene with me and Nargis.

687
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:23,740
Then? I opened my eyes.
And what do I see?

688
01:20:23,780 --> 01:20:26,100
I'm lying beneath the cot and
the mattress is on top of me.

689
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,970
What are you all doing here?
Go to the sets.

690
01:20:33,180 --> 01:20:34,910
We need a boy and girl
on the set.

691
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:36,940
Do I carry them
in my pocket? Get lost.

692
01:20:37,090 --> 01:20:38,190
Okay.

693
01:20:40,410 --> 01:20:41,810
This is the studio.

694
01:20:43,650 --> 01:20:45,650
How will we find him
in such a big studio?

695
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:51,600
When I came here earlier,
I asked my friend, Gogi, to trace him.

696
01:20:52,350 --> 01:20:54,120
It's possible he may
have found him.

697
01:20:56,020 --> 01:20:57,220
Who's Gogi?

698
01:20:58,810 --> 01:21:03,600
Gogi... that... uh... short, stout man,
who was playing the harmonica?

699
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:06,560
Hey, mister, would you two
like to apply makeup?

700
01:21:07,790 --> 01:21:10,710
- Makeup?
- Yes. Makeup. Haven't you ever applied makeup?

701
01:21:12,110 --> 01:21:14,290
Oh, makeup? Of course
we have, many times.

702
01:21:14,350 --> 01:21:17,240
Quite a few times, but
we're new here.

703
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:18,940
I see. Come with me.

704
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:23,610
What's all this?
What's he talking about?

705
01:21:23,660 --> 01:21:26,770
I think he was waiting for someone else;
he just grabbed us instead.

706
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:30,310
- But I've never acted in films.
- As if I have.

707
01:21:30,530 --> 01:21:33,630
- What now?
- Please don't worry. I'll fix everything.

708
01:21:34,180 --> 01:21:37,530
In fact, it's good that we so easily
got a chance to look for Shyam.

709
01:21:37,870 --> 01:21:40,070
- Where's your friend Gogi?
- He must be somewhere here.

710
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:42,370
Hey, do this love scene later.

711
01:21:42,610 --> 01:21:44,840
- Come with me.
- Sure. Let's go.

712
01:21:49,730 --> 01:21:52,880
I was given so much
respect in Madras.

713
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:57,220
I used to work in Gemini Studios;
in Chandralekha, I sat on a swing...

714
01:21:57,380 --> 01:22:02,080
how I swung from here to there.
I swung so well.

715
01:22:02,170 --> 01:22:03,870
- What's going on?
- Who let you...?

716
01:22:03,930 --> 01:22:06,570
- Sorry, Mr. Assistant.
- Dada, you have to do their makeup.

717
01:22:07,930 --> 01:22:09,750
- A beard and moustache for him.
- And her?

718
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:11,730
Just let her be.

719
01:22:11,830 --> 01:22:15,490
- Listen, Director Sir...
- You bore me daily. - Please sit down.

720
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:19,110
Look, they have just arrived and
you're giving them a beard.

721
01:22:19,180 --> 01:22:21,470
- Give me a chance too.
- What do you want?

722
01:22:21,730 --> 01:22:25,110
- Shall I give you a beard?
- No, sir. I'm not talking about a beard.

723
01:22:25,390 --> 01:22:29,480
Give me a chance too. What do I lack?
Let me show you how well I can dance.

724
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:32,270
Watch. Please watch now.
Sit carefully, okay?

725
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:39,620
Enough, enough, enough!

726
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:42,480
Let me sing for you.
Listen, how well I sing.

727
01:22:42,530 --> 01:22:44,790
My breath is coming fast.
It's okay, no problem.

728
01:22:47,830 --> 01:22:52,900
Let's dance with joy,
and sing... [singing in Tamil]

729
01:22:55,010 --> 01:22:57,330
Enough, stop it.
This won't do here.

730
01:22:57,570 --> 01:23:01,400
Then I'll sing in Hindi. A Lata
Mangeshkar song from the film New Delhi.

731
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:06,740
Your flute...

732
01:23:07,220 --> 01:23:11,700
Your flute has become
my enemy, Lord Krishna

733
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:15,590
your flute has become my enemy

734
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:21,010
Lord Krishna... your flute
has become my enemy

735
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:26,090
You seduced me by feigning love

736
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:29,500
Now, o faithless one,
you follow me all the time

737
01:23:30,010 --> 01:23:31,890
Now, my eyes...

738
01:23:33,210 --> 01:23:35,790
- Did you like it?
- Forget about acting...

739
01:23:36,060 --> 01:23:37,830
we'll take you
as a singer. Go.

740
01:23:37,900 --> 01:23:40,320
- Sure. How nice you are!
- Dada, be quick.

741
01:24:01,130 --> 01:24:04,020
Why are you staring at me?

742
01:24:06,110 --> 01:24:10,490
Those same lips, the same
style, the same eyes.

743
01:24:11,150 --> 01:24:12,450
The same action.

744
01:24:17,830 --> 01:24:20,400
You're just like
[the actor] Dilip Kumar.

745
01:24:20,650 --> 01:24:25,260
Oh, like 'Babul' in Dilip Kumar...
sorry, Dilip Kumar in the film 'Babul'...

746
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:29,230
looked at me just like this.
My heart beats began to quicken.

747
01:24:29,970 --> 01:24:35,430
And then, when I returned his gaze,
he fell ill for eight days.

748
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:39,230
The director would lift him up
and sprinkle water on his face.

749
01:24:40,150 --> 01:24:43,820
He'd come to his senses, look
at me and then faint again.

750
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:50,770
And this continued to happen,
again and again.

751
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:07,660
I've done your bidding, my love.
Now, give me my share.

752
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:10,440
For what?

753
01:25:10,770 --> 01:25:12,570
I too have a claim
on this necklace.

754
01:25:16,590 --> 01:25:18,090
On a fake pearl necklace?

755
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:20,210
I have to admire your style.

756
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:23,480
Do you know this is worth
more than Rs10,000?

757
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:27,830
Didn't you say this isn't
worth anything at all?

758
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:31,230
That estimation was only
for that idiot's benefit.

759
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:35,240
But I'm not that foolish.

760
01:25:41,590 --> 01:25:43,090
Madam, go to the set.

761
01:25:46,250 --> 01:25:48,130
- May I go?
- Go. Don't worry.

762
01:25:48,460 --> 01:25:51,910
I'll find Shyam and
meet you on the set. Go.

763
01:26:10,060 --> 01:26:12,380
How many chances do you get
to apply makeup each month?

764
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:15,170
Actually, I get
many opportunities.

765
01:26:15,990 --> 01:26:18,230
But I haven't got
a major breakthrough.

766
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:22,390
Perhaps today is my lucky day.

767
01:26:35,230 --> 01:26:36,860
Where is Stage No.2?

768
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:40,900
What's your name?

769
01:26:41,970 --> 01:26:44,980
- Mine? - Yes.
- Laaj.

770
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:52,040
My word. Why do you
talk with downcast eyes?

771
01:26:52,990 --> 01:26:55,450
People here call me Pehalwan.

772
01:26:57,060 --> 01:26:59,650
I've been in this profession
for 10 years.

773
01:27:00,420 --> 01:27:04,380
But, I swear to God, I've never
seen a lovelier face.

774
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:10,480
You look like Madhubala
[ the actress].

775
01:27:12,130 --> 01:27:15,260
The director?
He knows me.

776
01:27:15,330 --> 01:27:17,840
I'll ask him to cast you
as the supporting actress.

777
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:19,920
But when the day's
shooting ends...

778
01:27:20,580 --> 01:27:22,690
What is it, Pehalwan?
What's happening here?

779
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:25,640
Disgusting! You see a
lone girl and tease her.

780
01:27:25,780 --> 01:27:28,000
Don't you dare tease
a girl again, understand?

781
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:32,660
I'll tear your car... sorry, your beard
and put it into your pocket.

782
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:34,850
Get out. I said,
go, you rascal!

783
01:27:37,310 --> 01:27:40,210
Miss, miss, don't be afraid.

784
01:27:40,490 --> 01:27:43,170
He's a 'pehalwan' (wrestler)
only in name.

785
01:27:43,470 --> 01:27:48,230
If I squint at him sternly, he will be
out of action for 36 days.

786
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:52,120
Miss, are you new here?

787
01:27:53,940 --> 01:27:55,510
Where is Stage No.2?

788
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:59,090
Opposite my house... sorry, uh,
it's just across from here, miss.

789
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:01,140
Go.

790
01:28:13,110 --> 01:28:16,486
Excuse me, sir,
where's Stage No.2?

791
01:28:16,510 --> 01:28:17,810
I don't know.

792
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:21,000
I'm asking about
Stage No.2.

793
01:28:21,130 --> 01:28:22,860
I told you I don't know.

794
01:28:23,650 --> 01:28:25,346
This way or that?

795
01:28:25,370 --> 01:28:28,410
Are you asking directions or
intimidating me? I don't know!

796
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:30,376
If you know, then do tell me.

797
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:34,170
You are troubling me like a beggar.
Forgive me. I don't know!

798
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:41,260
- I'm sporting a disguise.
- But why?

799
01:28:41,290 --> 01:28:43,470
- To catch that thief.
- But where's the police?

800
01:28:43,530 --> 01:28:45,226
I couldn't fetch them.
Where's the thief?

801
01:28:45,250 --> 01:28:47,930
I saw the thief in the
dancer Neena's room.

802
01:28:48,170 --> 01:28:49,570
Where's that makeup room?

803
01:28:49,630 --> 01:28:53,060
Makeup room?
Uh, yes, over there.

804
01:28:54,690 --> 01:28:56,440
No, not inside there.

805
01:28:57,690 --> 01:29:00,260
A little to the side.
Yes, that's fine.

806
01:29:02,090 --> 01:29:05,500
- Not there.
- Sir, where do I sit? Tell me.

807
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:10,000
I told you, go sit there.

808
01:29:11,390 --> 01:29:12,690
Yes, that's fine.

809
01:29:15,580 --> 01:29:17,420
Hey, what's wrong with you?

810
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:42,130
Oh, you're here?
Please sit.

811
01:29:42,990 --> 01:29:46,120
- Where's your friend?
- He must be on his way.

812
01:29:46,510 --> 01:29:48,120
Oh. Can you dance?

813
01:29:48,570 --> 01:29:50,490
- Pardon?
- Dance? Ballroom dance?

814
01:29:51,290 --> 01:29:54,220
- Yes, a little.
- A little? Will do.

815
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:38,980
Hello.

816
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:42,760
May I?

817
01:30:58,290 --> 01:30:59,590
Who are you?

818
01:31:04,820 --> 01:31:06,220
What do you want?

819
01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:07,560
Necklace.

820
01:31:16,660 --> 01:31:17,860
Which necklace?

821
01:31:18,590 --> 01:31:20,240
Do I have to tell you?

822
01:31:22,250 --> 01:31:26,780
Give it to me quietly,
or it may be that the police...

823
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,740
Why was this necessary?

824
01:31:39,290 --> 01:31:44,540
Anyway, since you've started it,
I'll have to end it.

825
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:14,980
Should I break your bones or will you
tell me where the necklace is?

826
01:32:15,150 --> 01:32:17,320
I'll tell you.
But let go of me.

827
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:19,880
Leave me. The necklace
is made of fake pearls.

828
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:23,200
- Stop talking rubbish.
- I speak the truth.

829
01:32:23,750 --> 01:32:26,031
I swear. Neena called a
jeweler here and showed it to him.

830
01:32:26,940 --> 01:32:30,160
He proved the necklace
is made of fake pearls.

831
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:32,190
- Fake pearls?
- Yes.

832
01:32:33,380 --> 01:32:36,970
Fool. Neena and the jeweler
have conned you.

833
01:32:37,880 --> 01:32:40,970
Do you know the price of
that necklace? Rs. 10,000.

834
01:32:41,700 --> 01:32:43,490
- Where is it?
- With Neena.

835
01:32:43,630 --> 01:32:45,360
- Where's Neena?
- At the set.

836
01:33:00,670 --> 01:33:01,870
Hurry up.

837
01:33:02,330 --> 01:33:04,070
Put on me No. 12.

838
01:33:06,510 --> 01:33:08,350
- Go quickly. - Call Agnes.
- Agnes!

839
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:22,260
- Hello, Neena. - Hello.
- You haven't worn your earrings?

840
01:33:23,620 --> 01:33:25,120
I'll put them on now.

841
01:33:25,810 --> 01:33:27,210
This necklace is beautiful.

842
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:29,960
It's mine.

843
01:33:30,740 --> 01:33:34,640
- Are they expensive?
- No. They're fake pearls.

844
01:35:51,190 --> 01:35:53,750
Bloody jeweler. Tell me the truth.
Was the necklace real or fake?

845
01:35:54,230 --> 01:35:56,590
Real, absolutely genuine.

846
01:35:56,870 --> 01:35:58,570
Why did you lie to me then?

847
01:36:00,130 --> 01:36:02,130
I'll tell you why later.

848
01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:06,370
But right now, she has
made a fool of both of us.

849
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:10,660
So, what are your intentions?

850
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:15,120
You want her to get away with it
or retrieve the necklace?

851
01:36:18,060 --> 01:36:19,460
What do you suggest?

852
01:36:20,460 --> 01:36:24,480
The girl is on the set, and the
necklace is around her neck.

853
01:36:25,850 --> 01:36:28,060
Obviously, we should
both be there.

854
01:36:29,430 --> 01:36:32,270
Removing the necklace
is your job...

855
01:36:33,110 --> 01:36:35,780
and mine is to give you
Rs.5,000.

856
01:36:36,070 --> 01:36:39,770
5,000? It's actually
worth Rs.10,000.

857
01:36:40,310 --> 01:36:42,510
Stolen objects are
valued differently.

858
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:44,840
Do you accept?

859
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:47,800
Let's go.

860
01:37:33,580 --> 01:37:35,880
Miss Neena, let's have
a photograph. Please.

861
01:37:36,650 --> 01:37:37,960
Who are you?

862
01:37:38,010 --> 01:37:40,370
- Hurry up, please.
- Thank you. Please look to the side.

863
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:44,510
Please smile. Hmm...
Give me a dance pose.

864
01:37:45,490 --> 01:37:50,450
No... I think the photo will be better
if you remove the necklace.

865
01:37:51,080 --> 01:37:54,560
- Meaning?
- I mean that beauty isn't dependent on jewelry.

866
01:37:54,930 --> 01:37:57,970
Give me the necklace. I'll return it
once I click the photo.

867
01:37:58,270 --> 01:38:01,170
If you want to take a photo,
then take it like this. And hurry up.

868
01:38:09,100 --> 01:38:14,400
Listen. The moment the playback begins,
get up and start dancing.

869
01:38:42,180 --> 01:38:44,060
Won't you sing here?

870
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:48,690
Do you think I'm
a professional singer?

871
01:38:59,530 --> 01:39:01,180
You are quite good-looking.

872
01:39:02,020 --> 01:39:05,970
If the directors here like your
voice, they'll make you a hero.

873
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:08,040
I'm not interested
in becoming a hero.

874
01:39:13,490 --> 01:39:15,030
The heroine is here, but...

875
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:19,100
the hero is nowhere in sight.

876
01:39:29,750 --> 01:39:32,390
You are blushing.

877
01:39:34,280 --> 01:39:35,780
Perhaps due to the make-up.

878
01:39:38,300 --> 01:39:40,190
You look like a real bandit.

879
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:43,580
Maybe because of the moustache?

880
01:39:45,030 --> 01:39:46,430
Cut! No, no, no!

881
01:39:47,500 --> 01:39:49,240
You aren't doing it right.

882
01:39:54,010 --> 01:39:56,750
The dance we're shooting
is a New Year dance.

883
01:39:57,250 --> 01:39:58,950
And like the custom
on New Year's,

884
01:39:59,540 --> 01:40:01,540
the lights will be switched off
after the dance.

885
01:40:02,740 --> 01:40:08,130
Clap, wish each other
Happy New Year, etc., in the dark.

886
01:40:10,160 --> 01:40:11,360
And listen.

887
01:40:12,180 --> 01:40:14,190
The lights will be switched off
only for a minute.

888
01:40:14,970 --> 01:40:18,030
And during this time, don't forget
to applaud or wish others.

889
01:41:12,580 --> 01:41:16,430
Those eyes flash like daggers

890
01:41:21,010 --> 01:41:26,550
Those eyes flash
like daggers, oh lord

891
01:41:26,830 --> 01:41:30,830
They wound me here,
and here, and here

892
01:42:02,670 --> 01:42:04,820
The day was passing...

893
01:42:06,340 --> 01:42:08,900
and I was ready to leave

894
01:42:15,050 --> 01:42:18,940
My lover and I exchanged glances

895
01:42:19,170 --> 01:42:21,220
Our eyes met

896
01:42:22,830 --> 01:42:26,630
Our eyes had to meet but once

897
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:34,850
I was wounded here,
and here and here

898
01:42:35,450 --> 01:42:40,850
Those eyes flash
like daggers, oh lord

899
01:42:41,260 --> 01:42:45,320
They wound me here,
and here, and here

900
01:43:06,350 --> 01:43:08,460
What could I do...

901
01:43:10,070 --> 01:43:12,750
when he said...

902
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:22,740
"I'm ensnared by your eyes...

903
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:25,070
please, stay awhile"

904
01:43:26,510 --> 01:43:30,340
I hesitated,
'Should I stay?', when...

905
01:43:34,580 --> 01:43:38,490
I was wounded here,
and here, and here

906
01:43:39,080 --> 01:43:44,470
Those eyes flash
like daggers, oh lord

907
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:49,000
They wound me here,
and here, and here

908
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,050
Tell me...

909
01:44:19,660 --> 01:44:22,230
have you ever seen...

910
01:44:28,310 --> 01:44:32,190
a gathering, all wounded
and trembling?

911
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:34,430
It's not just me

912
01:44:36,020 --> 01:44:39,790
I'm not the only one
who was hurt

913
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:48,020
They were wounded, oh,
they were wounded too

914
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:54,040
Those eyes flash
ike daggers, oh lord,

915
01:44:54,450 --> 01:44:58,330
They wounded me here
and here, and here

916
01:45:19,590 --> 01:45:20,790
My necklace.

917
01:45:21,490 --> 01:45:23,130
Who are you?

918
01:45:27,350 --> 01:45:28,980
Thief. Catch him.

919
01:45:30,590 --> 01:45:31,690
Thief.

920
01:46:28,790 --> 01:46:32,560
Will you hand over the necklace,
or shall we have an encore of our fight?

921
01:46:33,380 --> 01:46:36,050
I'll give it.
I got it only for you.

922
01:47:08,180 --> 01:47:11,010
One of the two men fighting there
has the necklace.

923
01:47:11,420 --> 01:47:13,580
Inspector Sharma,
surround the place.

924
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:46,890
I don't understand how such a theft
can occur in the studio.

925
01:47:49,790 --> 01:47:52,390
Neena, perhaps you can guess.

926
01:48:05,150 --> 01:48:07,130
Mr. Raj, the police have
surrounded the place

927
01:48:07,410 --> 01:48:10,480
They're chasing him on the
terrace. He'll be caught soon.

928
01:48:13,390 --> 01:48:14,690
There he is!

929
01:50:40,450 --> 01:50:41,900
Check the mains.

930
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:10,820
What's wrong, Pehalwan?

931
01:52:10,900 --> 01:52:13,280
The main switch has been shut.
There's some problem.

932
01:52:22,340 --> 01:52:24,770
What's happening?
Please tell me.

933
01:53:05,680 --> 01:53:06,980
Constable.

934
01:53:07,680 --> 01:53:11,520
Here, take this necklace and go quickly.
Get a taxi. You'll get home in time.

935
01:53:11,780 --> 01:53:14,140
- And you?
- Don't worry. I'll have to deal with the police.

936
01:53:14,280 --> 01:53:16,580
- Police?
- Search near the wall.

937
01:53:17,230 --> 01:53:19,506
But... but I can't
leave you like this.

938
01:53:19,530 --> 01:53:21,410
Please listen to me and go away.

939
01:53:22,600 --> 01:53:26,790
If I leave here with the necklace,
the cops will arrest you for its theft.

940
01:53:27,090 --> 01:53:28,790
Please allow me to
fulfill my promise.

941
01:53:29,260 --> 01:53:32,550
I'll be satisfied if you reach home
in time with the necklace.

942
01:53:36,630 --> 01:53:38,030
Why don't you understand?

943
01:53:38,460 --> 01:53:41,256
If I leave, the police will arrest you.
Your self-respect is at stake.

944
01:53:41,280 --> 01:53:43,180
And if you don't go,
what about your honor?

945
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:45,350
You tried to commit
suicide for this.

946
01:53:49,810 --> 01:53:51,010
Get down.

947
01:53:54,030 --> 01:53:56,776
Neena, why didn't you tell me earlier
that the necklace cost Rs.10,000?

948
01:53:56,800 --> 01:53:58,830
Sir, he's the man who escaped
with the necklace.

949
01:53:59,250 --> 01:54:01,780
- Where's the necklace?
- Inspector, I have the necklace.

950
01:54:02,450 --> 01:54:03,950
And it belongs to her.

951
01:54:04,930 --> 01:54:08,290
Why, Ms. Neena, didn't you say
the necklace belonged to you?

952
01:54:09,030 --> 01:54:10,130
Pardon?

953
01:54:15,220 --> 01:54:17,740
- Well... - Neena!
- Mr. Shyam!

954
01:54:19,160 --> 01:54:20,810
Please speak without fear.

955
01:54:22,950 --> 01:54:25,730
Shyam gave it to me.

956
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:29,090
Mr. Shyam, what's all this?

957
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:30,940
Inspector...

958
01:54:33,630 --> 01:54:35,420
lnspector, this man
was trying to escape.

959
01:54:35,570 --> 01:54:37,750
I wasn't trying
to escape but to leave.

960
01:54:40,700 --> 01:54:44,050
Inspector, he's the jeweler who
connived with Neena to cheat me.

961
01:54:45,160 --> 01:54:47,990
Inspector, I was called here to strike
a deal for the necklace.

962
01:54:49,210 --> 01:54:52,210
Yes. You were called to declare
the real necklace a fake.

963
01:54:54,290 --> 01:54:56,130
Inspector, I swear
the necklace belongs to her.

964
01:54:56,360 --> 01:54:59,200
I don't know anything. All of
you come to the police station.

965
01:54:59,300 --> 01:55:01,860
- Come on, Mr. Sharma.
- Inspector, I want to tell you something.

966
01:55:01,930 --> 01:55:04,350
Whatever you want to say,
say it at the police station.

967
01:55:17,200 --> 01:55:18,600
What are you thinking?

968
01:55:20,830 --> 01:55:25,050
If I hadn't met you today, I wonder
what would have happened.

969
01:55:40,040 --> 01:55:41,560
When are you getting engaged?

970
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:45,390
Father is leaving today morning.

971
01:55:47,990 --> 01:55:49,800
It will happen
in a couple of days.

972
01:55:57,600 --> 01:56:00,040
Have you seen the boy to whom
you are getting engaged?

973
01:56:01,470 --> 01:56:02,570
No.

974
01:56:02,680 --> 01:56:04,080
What does he do?

975
01:56:05,080 --> 01:56:06,380
I don't know.

976
01:56:10,990 --> 01:56:12,390
What do you do?

977
01:56:14,360 --> 01:56:16,660
I wander around
in search of stories.

978
01:56:17,650 --> 01:56:19,070
- What?
- I'm a journalist.

979
01:56:20,750 --> 01:56:22,250
I write for Bharat Times.

980
01:56:27,550 --> 01:56:30,950
Will you publish today's incident
in your newspaper?

981
01:56:35,950 --> 01:56:37,150
Not now.

982
01:56:38,780 --> 01:56:40,900
When I followed you at
Bombay Central railway station,

983
01:56:42,510 --> 01:56:45,200
I thought I may get a story
for my newspaper.

984
01:56:50,170 --> 01:56:53,030
Where will you find a truer,
stranger story than this?

985
01:56:55,340 --> 01:56:57,860
Had it been any other girl,
I'd surely have published it.

986
01:57:09,210 --> 01:57:11,300
Driver, please stop here.

987
01:57:31,190 --> 01:57:33,130
So, I have fulfilled my promise.

988
01:57:35,080 --> 01:57:37,990
I've brought you back home
with the necklace before 5 'o clock.

989
01:57:44,840 --> 01:57:49,620
I have to confess it pains me
to separate from you.

990
01:57:50,510 --> 01:57:53,160
Perhaps it grieves me
more than it does you.

991
01:57:53,590 --> 01:57:56,930
But I have begun to love life
because of this exquisite pain.

992
01:57:59,930 --> 01:58:01,670
I met you 6 hours ago.

993
01:58:02,700 --> 01:58:06,030
But it feels like I've known you
for 6,000 years.

994
01:58:10,860 --> 01:58:13,540
Why didn't you meet me
a few days earlier, hmm?

995
01:58:14,240 --> 01:58:15,980
I could ask you
the same question.

996
01:58:19,830 --> 01:58:23,360
We couldn't be further apart,
despite being so close together.

997
01:58:24,220 --> 01:58:25,920
Perhaps this is what
is called Fate.

998
01:58:28,180 --> 01:58:33,620
My only wish is that, wherever you are,
you remain happy, prosperous.

999
01:58:37,110 --> 01:58:38,310
And you?

1000
01:58:43,300 --> 01:58:45,440
Meeting you is a source
of joy, 'tis true

1001
01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:48,580
Meeting you leaves me
overcome by grief.

1002
02:00:41,220 --> 02:00:45,440
My heart is a vagabond

1003
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:50,190
Who knows
whom it will settle on?

1004
02:01:23,180 --> 02:01:25,300
Never stopping, never still

1005
02:01:25,510 --> 02:01:27,700
Chasing unknown melodies

1006
02:01:27,900 --> 02:01:32,060
Wavering between choices

1007
02:01:48,250 --> 02:01:52,340
And beaten, wanders door-to-door

1008
02:01:52,720 --> 02:01:56,930
Who knows
whom it will settle on?

1009
02:01:57,250 --> 02:02:01,320
My heart is a vagabond

1010
02:02:01,740 --> 02:02:05,730
Who knows
whom it will settle on?

1011
02:02:29,090 --> 02:02:31,160
It met someone

1012
02:02:31,260 --> 02:02:33,430
But is puzzled by what happened

1013
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:37,880
Was it a wakeful moment?
Or perhaps just a dream

1014
02:02:53,810 --> 02:02:57,780
Left desolate in its own pain

1015
02:02:58,270 --> 02:03:02,130
Who knows
whom it will settle on?

1016
02:03:02,790 --> 02:03:06,810
My heart is a vagabond

1017
02:03:07,260 --> 02:03:11,370
Who knows
whom it will settle on?

1018
02:03:11,740 --> 02:03:15,780
My heart is a vagabond

1019
02:03:16,210 --> 02:03:20,210
Who knows whom it will settle on

1020
02:04:28,100 --> 02:04:30,620
Father, it's 5 o'clock.

1021
02:04:36,210 --> 02:04:37,510
It's 5 o'clock?

1022
02:04:39,700 --> 02:04:43,030
My dear, send Ramu
with a cup of tea for me.

1023
02:04:44,760 --> 02:04:46,360
- Tea?
- Yes, tea.

1024
02:04:48,360 --> 02:04:50,140
You go and get ready too.

1025
02:04:53,500 --> 02:04:55,230
- Me too, father?
- Yes.

1026
02:04:56,290 --> 02:04:57,890
Won't you come see me off?

1027
02:05:00,490 --> 02:05:04,520
It's time for the flight to leave, but
there's no sign of your doctor uncle.

1028
02:05:07,550 --> 02:05:11,350
My dear, the boy
you are going to marry...

1029
02:05:12,040 --> 02:05:15,500
is also coming with him.
The boy is very nice.

1030
02:05:16,080 --> 02:05:19,270
I like him very much.
Yet, I would like you...

1031
02:05:19,960 --> 02:05:22,550
to see him once, meet him once.

1032
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:35,300
There they come.

1033
02:05:40,540 --> 02:05:41,940
Why did you stop?

1034
02:05:45,080 --> 02:05:46,276
What's wrong?

1035
02:05:46,300 --> 02:05:49,540
Hey, Doctor saab, it's she!

1036
02:05:50,060 --> 02:05:51,160
What?

1037
02:05:53,690 --> 02:05:55,190
Don't you like the boy?

1038
02:05:59,220 --> 02:06:00,420
Thank God.

1039
02:06:01,150 --> 02:06:02,450
It's she, indeed.

1040
02:06:03,120 --> 02:06:04,420
It's she?

1041
02:06:06,880 --> 02:06:10,210
You've already met Shankarlal.
This is his daughter, Laaj.

1042
02:06:10,330 --> 02:06:11,730
Greet him, my dear.

1043
02:06:15,530 --> 02:06:17,060
Very pleased to meet you.

1044
02:06:17,780 --> 02:06:20,210
But, why were you both delayed?

1045
02:06:20,260 --> 02:06:22,860
Fact is, I was saddled with
such a responsibilty last night...

1046
02:06:23,290 --> 02:06:25,330
I didn't get the chance
to even take a nap.

1047
02:06:27,110 --> 02:06:28,820
What's the matter
with you, my dear?

1048
02:06:29,170 --> 02:06:30,880
I don't understand
anything, father.

1049
02:06:31,020 --> 02:06:32,720
You'll figure it out
soon enough.

1050
02:06:34,120 --> 02:06:35,720
At which college do you study?

1051
02:06:35,780 --> 02:06:39,790
Laaj studies at National College.
She's a very bright student.

1052
02:06:40,450 --> 02:06:43,770
She's won quite a few prizes
for singing and dancing.

1053
02:06:43,970 --> 02:06:47,590
I'm fond of singing too. In fact,
people often tease me, saying...

1054
02:06:47,700 --> 02:06:50,650
that my parents should have
named me Hemant Kumar.

1055
02:06:52,510 --> 02:06:55,000
What's the matter, my dear?
Are you all right?

1056
02:06:55,350 --> 02:06:56,650
It's nothing, father.

1057
02:06:59,380 --> 02:07:03,140
Okay, my dear. Look after the house.
I'll return the day after tomorrow.

1058
02:07:03,520 --> 02:07:06,310
Kashyap, should I convey
any message to your mother?

1059
02:07:06,620 --> 02:07:10,946
Just tell her that...
uh... uh... that I'm very happy.

1060
02:07:10,970 --> 02:07:12,170
All right.

1061
02:07:44,910 --> 02:07:49,010
You may call it a joke,
but it's true

1062
02:07:49,340 --> 02:07:53,760
There's something that makes her
wander the streets with me

1063
02:08:06,710 --> 02:08:10,690
What more can I say?
You have to understand the rest

1064
02:08:10,860 --> 02:08:15,010
Look, look at her carefully

1065
02:08:15,270 --> 02:08:19,010
She's the one, indeed, it is she

1066
02:08:19,610 --> 02:08:20,990
It is she!
