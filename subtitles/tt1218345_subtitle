1
00:02:41,675 --> 00:02:45,270
'I'll get the moon
and the stars for you.'

2
00:02:46,613 --> 00:02:48,274
'I'll take care of you.'

3
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:53,818
'I will fight with the world
but will never leave you.'

4
00:02:55,555 --> 00:02:59,013
'Lovers used to go the distance to
see a glimpse of their beloved.'

5
00:03:01,294 --> 00:03:03,285
'Somebody used to run a
marathon in the dessert.'

6
00:03:04,831 --> 00:03:08,028
'Somebody used to
swim across oceans.'

7
00:03:08,635 --> 00:03:10,865
'Somebody used to make
way through the mountains.'

8
00:03:11,505 --> 00:03:13,302
'Boss, it is not easy to build
a building for 20 years.

9
00:03:13,373 --> 00:03:16,035
That too with the same colour.'

10
00:03:16,643 --> 00:03:17,871
'One needs patience.'

11
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:20,302
'Shahjahan was not a fool...

12
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,507
...who spent so much on marble.'

13
00:03:23,316 --> 00:03:26,513
'He did this for
true love. True love.'

14
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,311
'The union of soul
with the soul. Wow... '

15
00:03:31,892 --> 00:03:32,984
'But then... '

16
00:03:38,064 --> 00:03:39,554
'Then the times changed.'

17
00:04:27,047 --> 00:04:30,107
Why are you wearing
dark glares at night?

18
00:04:31,384 --> 00:04:32,442
It's my style.

19
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,578
Remove it.
- No!

20
00:04:34,654 --> 00:04:36,383
Remove your glares!
- No! Look! No!

21
00:04:36,456 --> 00:04:37,980
Samit, remove your glasses!
- No!

22
00:04:38,058 --> 00:04:39,116
I said, no!
- Remove it!

23
00:04:39,392 --> 00:04:40,450
No, please!
- Remove your glasses!

24
00:04:40,527 --> 00:04:41,585
I'll leave the steering!

25
00:04:41,661 --> 00:04:42,719
I said, no!

26
00:04:42,796 --> 00:04:44,127
You're behaving like a child! God!

27
00:04:48,401 --> 00:04:52,132
People who know nothing about
style wear dark glares at night.

28
00:04:52,572 --> 00:04:54,403
You're jealous because
I'm looking handsome.

29
00:04:55,075 --> 00:04:57,407
You're wearing dark glares!
Can you see anything?

30
00:04:57,477 --> 00:04:59,411
What will you do if
there's a pothole...

31
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:00,537
...or a speed breaker on the road?

32
00:05:00,614 --> 00:05:01,808
You know, I have a backache.

33
00:05:01,948 --> 00:05:03,472
God knows why you have a backache.

34
00:05:03,883 --> 00:05:05,612
We've not done anything in
six months and three days.

35
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:07,081
Just because of you.

36
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,149
Most unromantic
person on this planet!

37
00:05:09,422 --> 00:05:11,413
What has romance got to do
with what happens in the bedroom?

38
00:05:11,491 --> 00:05:12,549
That too between a
husband and a wife.

39
00:05:12,626 --> 00:05:14,423
Husband and wife are beyond romance.

40
00:05:14,494 --> 00:05:16,428
Husbands and wives
are not beyond romance!

41
00:05:16,496 --> 00:05:17,554
You are beyond romance!

42
00:05:18,031 --> 00:05:19,157
And your silly games!

43
00:05:19,633 --> 00:05:21,430
Sometimes you are a
doctor and I am the nurse.

44
00:05:21,501 --> 00:05:24,470
Sometimes you are Bill
Clinton and I am Monica Lewinsky!

45
00:05:24,938 --> 00:05:26,633
I'm sick and tired
of these games, Samit.

46
00:05:26,806 --> 00:05:28,774
These games don't turn me on.

47
00:05:29,175 --> 00:05:31,166
Anyway, to do it you
have to come home.

48
00:05:31,478 --> 00:05:33,173
You're never home!
- Listen! Listen!

49
00:05:33,446 --> 00:05:34,777
I was at home last Sunday.
Did anything happen? No!

50
00:05:34,848 --> 00:05:36,440
You know mom had
come on last Sunday.

51
00:05:36,516 --> 00:05:38,848
Yes! Next day the A.C. Broke down!
- Yes, because of whom?

52
00:05:38,918 --> 00:05:40,180
Because of Raju, the electrician!

53
00:05:40,654 --> 00:05:42,781
I didn't know my private
life would depend on some Raju.

54
00:05:43,857 --> 00:05:45,449
You know, the doctor was saying
if you don't do it for too long...

55
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:47,459
...you lose the balance
between body and mind.

56
00:05:48,061 --> 00:05:49,790
I get dirty thoughts
all day in the office.

57
00:05:50,063 --> 00:05:51,792
I can't meet my female colleague.

58
00:05:52,532 --> 00:05:56,059
Awkward... I can't sit comfortably.
I have to stand up very often.

59
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:57,527
Oh, God!

60
00:05:58,204 --> 00:06:00,195
Didn't I tell you to
remove your glares and drive?

61
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,698
Sorry!

62
00:06:02,475 --> 00:06:03,533
I didn't see.

63
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,007
Didn't see! You can't hear!

64
00:06:06,646 --> 00:06:08,978
You don't feel anything! You
come late from work! - Yes!

65
00:06:09,049 --> 00:06:10,880
Then you say we don't have
any physical intimacy! - Yes!

66
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,815
You're married to a handicap!
I don't have my hands!

67
00:06:12,886 --> 00:06:14,478
I can't drive! My eyes are closed!
- What are you doing?

68
00:06:14,554 --> 00:06:16,146
I can't see anything.

69
00:06:16,222 --> 00:06:17,655
What are doing?
- We'll meet with an accident!

70
00:06:17,724 --> 00:06:19,487
Stop the car right now!
- We'll meet with an accident!

71
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,218
Stop the car!

72
00:06:23,496 --> 00:06:24,554
Madness!

73
00:06:27,967 --> 00:06:29,025
Oh God!

74
00:06:30,704 --> 00:06:31,762
Miracle!

75
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:34,501
What?

76
00:06:34,574 --> 00:06:35,632
I can see!

77
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:37,567
What?

78
00:06:37,644 --> 00:06:38,838
The speed breaker! Look!

79
00:06:41,047 --> 00:06:43,038
Are you going to walk
over it or should I drive?

80
00:07:11,044 --> 00:07:12,170
I'm warning you, Samit!

81
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:14,540
When we go to Rishi and Simi's...

82
00:07:14,614 --> 00:07:16,206
...you have to behave yourself.

83
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,209
For the last time!

84
00:07:18,551 --> 00:07:19,813
Yes. For the last time.

85
00:07:19,886 --> 00:07:22,821
'There are bound to be
ups and downs in life.'

86
00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:25,780
'You shouldn't feel insecure.'

87
00:07:26,292 --> 00:07:29,284
'God is not playing games with you.'

88
00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:33,221
No, he's playing
20-20 with us! Idiot!

89
00:07:34,567 --> 00:07:37,229
'Become a film
director in two months! '

90
00:07:37,303 --> 00:07:39,168
'Big B's film academy! '

91
00:07:40,573 --> 00:07:41,972
What do they think of themselves?

92
00:07:42,642 --> 00:07:44,132
They can make any
dumb person a filmmaker?

93
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:47,575
Hello! Some are born filmmakers.
Others can't become one.

94
00:07:48,014 --> 00:07:50,244
You get angry when
every student of yours is...

95
00:07:50,316 --> 00:07:51,749
...not Mira Nair or Shyam Benegal.

96
00:07:51,818 --> 00:07:53,581
Come on, Simi, that's nonsense.

97
00:07:53,653 --> 00:07:56,850
You know, I do appreciate
many students for their work.

98
00:07:56,923 --> 00:07:57,981
Really?

99
00:07:58,057 --> 00:07:59,991
Yes! In fact there's a student
who has submitted a good script.

100
00:08:00,059 --> 00:08:02,994
It's called, 'Why do men
have nipples? ' - What?

101
00:08:03,062 --> 00:08:04,996
No seriously! Why
do men have nipples?

102
00:08:05,765 --> 00:08:07,323
There they are.
- Yes.

103
00:08:08,334 --> 00:08:09,596
We'll not fight before them.

104
00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:10,727
Hello!

105
00:08:10,804 --> 00:08:11,998
Hello!
- Hi! - Hello!

106
00:08:12,071 --> 00:08:13,129
Hello!
- Welcome!

107
00:08:13,206 --> 00:08:14,264
Hi!
- Hi!

108
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,331
Welcome! Hello!
- Sorry, we are late.

109
00:08:16,609 --> 00:08:17,667
Should we remove the shoes here?

110
00:08:17,744 --> 00:08:18,802
Don't be silly.

111
00:08:18,878 --> 00:08:19,936
Shoes? What do you mean?

112
00:08:20,013 --> 00:08:21,071
No need.
- Remove the shoes out there!

113
00:08:21,147 --> 00:08:22,205
How are you, Samit?!

114
00:08:22,282 --> 00:08:23,340
We missed the dinner reservation.
- Sorry.

115
00:08:23,616 --> 00:08:24,674
It was at 8:30 or something.

116
00:08:25,618 --> 00:08:27,609
Maybe we can push it
by half an hour or so.

117
00:08:28,288 --> 00:08:29,346
How about a drink?
- Yes. Have some wine.

118
00:08:29,622 --> 00:08:32,284
Why don't you... - We
have some red wine.

119
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,286
I would like some wine, please.
- Sure!

120
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:37,888
Samit, same?

121
00:08:37,964 --> 00:08:39,022
It's a style.

122
00:08:39,098 --> 00:08:40,156
It's a style?

123
00:08:40,233 --> 00:08:41,291
It's my style.
- Mita!

124
00:08:41,367 --> 00:08:42,629
Thank you.
- Oh, God!

125
00:08:45,238 --> 00:08:47,638
Actually before going to dinner...

126
00:08:47,707 --> 00:08:50,039
...we'd like to say something.

127
00:08:50,109 --> 00:08:51,235
What is it?

128
00:08:51,311 --> 00:08:52,642
Should I? Or do you want to?

129
00:08:52,979 --> 00:08:54,037
Speak up!

130
00:08:54,314 --> 00:08:55,906
You're pregnant?
- Are you?

131
00:08:56,749 --> 00:08:58,649
How can she be pregnant? I
don't understand anything.

132
00:08:59,252 --> 00:09:04,155
Actually, Samit and
I are going to split.

133
00:09:11,397 --> 00:09:12,659
Let's go.

134
00:09:18,738 --> 00:09:20,729
It's not so serious.
We've had a talk.

135
00:09:20,807 --> 00:09:23,002
We think this is right
for us. We'll be fine.

136
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:24,335
Are you serious?

137
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:27,072
Yes.
- We've discussed it a lot.

138
00:09:27,814 --> 00:09:28,872
It's mutual.

139
00:09:29,682 --> 00:09:31,741
What are you saying, Samit?
- Yes.

140
00:09:32,952 --> 00:09:34,681
Let's go for dinner.
We'll talk outside.

141
00:09:34,821 --> 00:09:37,415
Why would we talk over dinner?
We'll talk at home.

142
00:09:38,424 --> 00:09:39,686
When did you decide?

143
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,691
Long back. Wouldn't you say?

144
00:09:42,762 --> 00:09:44,127
We didn't have a fight, you know.

145
00:09:44,197 --> 00:09:47,030
We are... you can see we are fine.
- We're fine.

146
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,294
Yes, we're fine.
- We're fine!

147
00:09:48,368 --> 00:09:50,700
What do you mean you're fine?
What's the reason?

148
00:09:52,305 --> 00:09:53,704
How can you split?

149
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,804
You are Samit-Mita for us.
You know. Samit-Mita!

150
00:09:56,876 --> 00:09:58,707
We're still Samit-Mita.
I'm Samit, she's...

151
00:09:58,778 --> 00:10:00,712
You'd get bored if we go
into the details. Really.

152
00:10:01,214 --> 00:10:04,445
I can never think of it.
It's shocking! I mean.

153
00:10:05,218 --> 00:10:06,446
You're so good together.

154
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,152
She's right. Hang on!

155
00:10:08,721 --> 00:10:10,154
Have you two found someone else?

156
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,787
No!
- No!

157
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,986
No!
- No!

158
00:10:15,061 --> 00:10:16,119
Yes, no!

159
00:10:16,195 --> 00:10:17,253
I'm interested. I want to know.

160
00:10:17,897 --> 00:10:19,728
You know, I'm feeling a little sick.

161
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:21,164
Listen, we're not spoiling anything.

162
00:10:21,234 --> 00:10:23,828
We just want to live separately.

163
00:10:23,903 --> 00:10:24,961
We are thinking about it.

164
00:10:25,038 --> 00:10:26,471
It was a tough decision to make.

165
00:10:26,739 --> 00:10:28,229
Now don't say you won't support us.

166
00:10:29,242 --> 00:10:31,836
This is madness! You'll
change your decision by nightfall.

167
00:10:31,911 --> 00:10:32,969
No, we've begun...

168
00:10:33,346 --> 00:10:34,904
We've begun to look for a place.

169
00:10:35,748 --> 00:10:38,478
She'll stay at the same
place and I'm moving out.

170
00:10:38,751 --> 00:10:39,877
I'm not feeling well.

171
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,478
Come on, Simi!

172
00:10:41,754 --> 00:10:42,812
Really Mita!

173
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:44,220
Let's have dinner.

174
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,952
Dinner? How can you think of
dinner at a time like this?

175
00:10:47,026 --> 00:10:48,755
Don't get upset.
- I'm not upset.

176
00:10:49,028 --> 00:10:50,928
I knew this would happen.
- You know everything.

177
00:10:50,997 --> 00:10:52,760
How can you say it so casually
that you're going to split...

178
00:10:52,832 --> 00:10:54,493
...as if nothing has happened?

179
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:57,765
I mean, you know each
other since a long time...

180
00:10:57,837 --> 00:11:00,431
...and suddenly out of the blue...
- Simi, it's none of our business.

181
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,098
Why not?

182
00:11:02,175 --> 00:11:03,301
They are our close friends.

183
00:11:03,776 --> 00:11:05,437
Look, there's not a
major problem between us.

184
00:11:05,511 --> 00:11:06,773
Then?

185
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,505
Couples do separate!
They have little problems.

186
00:11:09,782 --> 00:11:12,046
Samit, please, just don't
give me any of this nonsense.

187
00:11:12,118 --> 00:11:13,244
It is institution of marriage...

188
00:11:14,053 --> 00:11:16,817
We were so close! At least,
I thought so!

189
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,188
Why is she so upset?

190
00:11:22,829 --> 00:11:24,091
She cares about us.

191
00:11:24,797 --> 00:11:26,025
I also care about you.

192
00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:27,157
Simi!

193
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,198
Simi, we are fine.
We wanted to do this.

194
00:11:31,004 --> 00:11:33,472
Simi, why are you
taking this so personally?

195
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:35,939
I am upset. Can't I get upset?

196
00:11:36,943 --> 00:11:39,377
Simi, I've talked to
a marriage counselor.

197
00:11:39,445 --> 00:11:40,537
When?

198
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,811
She has talked to a
marriage counselor.

199
00:11:43,282 --> 00:11:45,807
They've talked to a
marriage counselor.

200
00:11:45,985 --> 00:11:48,249
Marriage counselor? The
matter has become so serious!

201
00:11:48,321 --> 00:11:49,549
And no one even bothered to tell me!

202
00:11:49,822 --> 00:11:50,880
Thank you!
- Simi!

203
00:11:52,825 --> 00:11:54,156
Listen, Rishi!

204
00:11:55,094 --> 00:11:56,891
Please! Please!
- This is too much.

205
00:11:56,963 --> 00:11:58,897
Don't make it into a
World War III. Please.

206
00:11:59,966 --> 00:12:02,366
Let's go for dinner.
Forget everything.

207
00:12:03,302 --> 00:12:04,428
Simi, come on!

208
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,831
I knew this would happen
if we came to your house.

209
00:12:09,909 --> 00:12:11,103
You don't have control over her.

210
00:12:11,444 --> 00:12:13,503
She must listen to you.

211
00:12:15,915 --> 00:12:19,908
'Didn't Mita ever tell you
about the separation? Any hint? '

212
00:12:20,286 --> 00:12:26,452
Now that I think about it
then Mita must have said it.

213
00:12:26,526 --> 00:12:27,584
About living on her own.

214
00:12:28,294 --> 00:12:30,592
But she never said
anything negative about Samit.

215
00:12:30,897 --> 00:12:31,955
As far as I can remember.

216
00:12:32,865 --> 00:12:34,059
'Tell us about yourself.'

217
00:12:37,603 --> 00:12:38,865
I am Simi Sharma.

218
00:12:39,238 --> 00:12:41,263
My husband's name is Rishi.

219
00:12:42,608 --> 00:12:45,099
We've been married since four years.

220
00:12:45,878 --> 00:12:47,038
We don't have any kids yet.

221
00:12:48,481 --> 00:12:49,880
I work for a magazine.

222
00:12:51,884 --> 00:12:53,909
I had a boyfriend before marriage.

223
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,881
We were going to get married but...

224
00:12:55,955 --> 00:12:57,354
...it didn't happen.

225
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:01,283
And it was nobody's fault.

226
00:13:01,427 --> 00:13:03,895
'Simi said they did go
for dinner that night...

227
00:13:03,963 --> 00:13:06,090
...but the
atmosphere was very tensed.'

228
00:13:06,165 --> 00:13:07,223
Please!
- Please!

229
00:13:10,236 --> 00:13:12,397
You know Samit, a new
restaurant has opened up.

230
00:13:14,574 --> 00:13:15,632
Chinese?

231
00:13:16,075 --> 00:13:17,133
Yes!

232
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:21,237
So...

233
00:13:21,314 --> 00:13:23,305
Please! I can manage it.

234
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,641
No need to put on this act.

235
00:13:26,419 --> 00:13:27,477
To show that you care.

236
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,978
I know that you don't.

237
00:13:30,189 --> 00:13:31,247
Mita!

238
00:13:32,925 --> 00:13:33,983
What happened?

239
00:13:34,427 --> 00:13:36,520
Are you embarrassed in front
of your friends? Is that it?

240
00:13:36,929 --> 00:13:38,453
Do you want to maintain
your goody-goody image?

241
00:13:39,098 --> 00:13:40,929
Of course! No! No!

242
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,262
Samit is perfect!

243
00:13:42,535 --> 00:13:45,663
I am bad and I have all
the shortcomings. Right?

244
00:13:46,672 --> 00:13:49,607
Mita, we had discussed
that we will behave properly.

245
00:13:49,675 --> 00:13:50,937
We are fine, aren't we?

246
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,944
We are not fine! You are fine.

247
00:13:53,412 --> 00:13:55,539
You've been with me
just for your convenience.

248
00:13:56,949 --> 00:13:59,543
You are successful
just because of me.

249
00:14:00,052 --> 00:14:01,952
I have made all the sacrifices.

250
00:14:02,288 --> 00:14:03,346
What have you done?

251
00:14:03,489 --> 00:14:04,547
We're fine?

252
00:14:05,024 --> 00:14:07,458
What does he say after
coming home? What's for dinner?

253
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,360
What have you made? Did
I tell you to make this?

254
00:14:10,429 --> 00:14:12,090
Where are my Hakka noodles?

255
00:14:12,331 --> 00:14:13,958
You are so lazy, Samit!

256
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,460
And so untidy!

257
00:14:15,968 --> 00:14:18,198
He can't even keep his
cupboard clean. Do you know that?

258
00:14:18,971 --> 00:14:20,962
I don't know what I've been
doing with you all these years.

259
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,507
And your clothes?
What are you wearing?

260
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,972
What do you think of yourselves?
You think you are a superstar?

261
00:14:25,344 --> 00:14:27,141
Mita!
- Don't touch me Samit!

262
00:14:28,714 --> 00:14:33,344
You know, I never felt that
you care. That you need me.

263
00:14:33,719 --> 00:14:34,981
And why would I?

264
00:14:36,355 --> 00:14:38,323
Who am I to you?

265
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,559
Say it before everybody.
Who am I to you?

266
00:14:41,627 --> 00:14:43,390
I'm your housemaid! That's it!

267
00:14:43,462 --> 00:14:44,986
You don't appreciate me.

268
00:14:45,531 --> 00:14:47,726
Have you ever appreciated me?

269
00:14:48,134 --> 00:14:49,499
Have you ever said
anything nice about me?

270
00:14:49,569 --> 00:14:52,561
Can you say it now? Before
your friends. Try! Say it!

271
00:14:54,273 --> 00:14:56,036
Can you look at me when I'm
talking to you, Samit? Please!

272
00:14:57,543 --> 00:14:59,602
I'm wasting my time with you! God!

273
00:15:06,152 --> 00:15:08,211
Waiter?
- Waiter!

274
00:15:12,325 --> 00:15:13,383
Amazing!

275
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:16,023
We think we know our friends...

276
00:15:16,095 --> 00:15:19,087
...but actually we have no
idea what they are thinking.

277
00:15:19,165 --> 00:15:20,223
I mean.

278
00:15:23,302 --> 00:15:25,133
Do you also hide things from me?

279
00:15:26,105 --> 00:15:27,163
What?

280
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,398
Me?

281
00:15:29,175 --> 00:15:32,702
I'm talking about them.
Not us. What would I hide?

282
00:15:32,778 --> 00:15:37,112
I don't know. Some
hidden feeling or desire.

283
00:15:37,483 --> 00:15:39,110
Some fantasy might be!

284
00:15:39,185 --> 00:15:41,153
No! Nothing!

285
00:15:43,055 --> 00:15:44,113
Do you?

286
00:15:45,191 --> 00:15:46,249
No.

287
00:15:47,226 --> 00:15:48,784
Maybe sometimes, I...

288
00:15:50,062 --> 00:15:51,222
What do you mean?

289
00:15:52,665 --> 00:15:53,723
I don't know.

290
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:55,164
You're very critical, you know.

291
00:15:55,234 --> 00:15:56,599
No, tell me, Simi.

292
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:00,538
Forget it. We've
fought about this before.

293
00:16:01,707 --> 00:16:04,141
Let's go to sleep.
We'll talk tomorrow.

294
00:16:05,144 --> 00:16:06,475
I'm sorry. I'm fine.

295
00:16:08,147 --> 00:16:10,672
Samit must have
said something to you.

296
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:11,808
You meet him everyday.

297
00:16:13,252 --> 00:16:16,551
Yes! He had told me
about an incident.

298
00:16:16,622 --> 00:16:19,147
Palli! Palli, come here.

299
00:16:20,192 --> 00:16:21,250
What is it?

300
00:16:21,761 --> 00:16:22,819
This morning...

301
00:16:24,297 --> 00:16:25,730
...what were you saying about Sush?

302
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:29,224
I just said she is very
forward-looking. Why don't you try?

303
00:16:29,302 --> 00:16:31,395
No! Are you crazy?
- Why? What's the problem?

304
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,767
No! I don't do such things.

305
00:16:32,838 --> 00:16:35,500
She doesn't say anything to anyone.
She's not a whistle-blower.

306
00:16:36,108 --> 00:16:39,271
All the juniors are having
fun and the seniors are... Iook!

307
00:16:39,512 --> 00:16:40,570
Hi!

308
00:16:41,447 --> 00:16:43,472
Shall I call her?
- Don't look! - Why?

309
00:16:43,549 --> 00:16:44,607
Don't look at her!

310
00:16:45,651 --> 00:16:50,520
What about my wife?
What if she finds out?

311
00:16:50,856 --> 00:16:54,189
Look, you had said your
married life is boring.

312
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,318
Didn't you?
- I did?

313
00:16:55,394 --> 00:16:57,294
Of course!
- When? - Over lunch!

314
00:16:57,363 --> 00:16:58,694
No question about it! I didn't!
- You did!

315
00:16:58,764 --> 00:17:00,732
Did I say that?
- Yes, you did.

316
00:17:02,134 --> 00:17:04,364
Did I say it after having beer?
- Yes.

317
00:17:05,538 --> 00:17:08,200
She's a hot babe.
She's won a beauty pageant.

318
00:17:09,141 --> 00:17:10,267
Come here!
- What?

319
00:17:10,443 --> 00:17:11,501
Come here!

320
00:17:16,215 --> 00:17:17,273
What is it?

321
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,215
What exactly did I say?

322
00:17:19,285 --> 00:17:21,344
You had said Mita is very cold.

323
00:17:21,654 --> 00:17:23,451
And your aerobic
trainer is very hot.

324
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:25,548
What?

325
00:17:26,158 --> 00:17:27,216
No.

326
00:17:27,326 --> 00:17:28,657
I shouldn't have beer during lunch.

327
00:17:28,894 --> 00:17:30,759
Forget about it.
- No. - I'll give you her number.

328
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,354
No.
- Just wait!

329
00:17:32,832 --> 00:17:33,890
I don't want it!

330
00:17:34,367 --> 00:17:37,268
Take her number and talk to her.
- I don't want it.

331
00:17:40,172 --> 00:17:44,233
What do I say to her? What do
I want to do? What do I say?

332
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,843
Give her some hint!

333
00:17:45,911 --> 00:17:47,242
Hint?
- Yes.

334
00:17:47,747 --> 00:17:48,805
For example?

335
00:17:49,382 --> 00:17:50,610
Give her a smile.

336
00:17:50,783 --> 00:17:52,307
I smile at her everyday.

337
00:17:53,619 --> 00:17:56,850
Tell her you want to give her
some notes outside the office.

338
00:17:56,922 --> 00:17:59,413
Notes? Outside the office?
Outside the office? - Yes!

339
00:18:01,327 --> 00:18:02,385
All right, see you later.
- No.

340
00:18:02,461 --> 00:18:03,928
I can't do it.
- Just understand.

341
00:18:04,196 --> 00:18:05,254
Palli! Palli!
- See you later.

342
00:18:10,336 --> 00:18:11,394
What?

343
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,608
No. No...

344
00:18:17,676 --> 00:18:19,439
Thank God, Samit
threw the number away.

345
00:18:19,812 --> 00:18:23,270
As far as I know, Samit
doesn't mess up with such girls.

346
00:18:23,649 --> 00:18:25,276
Why?
- He's too naive.

347
00:18:34,293 --> 00:18:35,658
'Yes, he did call.'

348
00:18:36,228 --> 00:18:37,820
'A month after he got the number.'

349
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:40,289
'He talked very
lovingly on the phone.'

350
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:43,297
'I think he was a
little tensed. You know.'

351
00:18:43,636 --> 00:18:45,331
He was behaving like a teenager.

352
00:18:45,905 --> 00:18:47,304
I think he was quite cute.

353
00:18:47,373 --> 00:18:48,567
'Where did you meet? '

354
00:18:48,707 --> 00:18:50,766
He wanted to meet at a coffee shop.

355
00:18:51,644 --> 00:18:52,975
I called him home.

356
00:18:53,846 --> 00:18:54,904
Door is locked?

357
00:18:55,514 --> 00:18:56,572
What?

358
00:18:56,649 --> 00:18:57,707
Door is locked?

359
00:18:57,783 --> 00:18:58,841
Yes.

360
00:19:00,386 --> 00:19:01,478
Is my mobile ringing?

361
00:19:02,621 --> 00:19:03,679
No.

362
00:19:03,756 --> 00:19:04,814
I thought I heard it.

363
00:19:05,257 --> 00:19:06,417
I don't hear anything.

364
00:19:11,263 --> 00:19:12,355
I think my mobile is ringing.

365
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:14,857
No, it's not.

366
00:19:19,338 --> 00:19:20,396
Door is locked?

367
00:19:20,806 --> 00:19:21,864
It is.

368
00:19:32,685 --> 00:19:33,743
What happened?

369
00:19:35,354 --> 00:19:36,412
I'm in pain.

370
00:19:36,489 --> 00:19:37,547
What?

371
00:19:38,591 --> 00:19:39,649
I have a stomachache!

372
00:19:40,392 --> 00:19:41,950
Why? What happened?
- I'm not feeling well.

373
00:19:42,027 --> 00:19:44,393
Did you eat something?
Want some water? - Yes.

374
00:19:44,463 --> 00:19:45,521
Give me some water.

375
00:19:47,299 --> 00:19:49,790
I think my mobile is ringing.
- It's not ringing.

376
00:19:52,037 --> 00:19:53,368
Just tell her, I'm in a meeting.

377
00:19:53,939 --> 00:19:54,997
I'm not feeling well.

378
00:19:57,743 --> 00:19:58,801
Do you want to something?

379
00:19:59,311 --> 00:20:01,472
Should I call a doctor? - Dispirin
(tablet)! Do you have dispirin?

380
00:20:03,382 --> 00:20:04,440
I think my mobile is ringing.

381
00:20:04,517 --> 00:20:05,575
It's not ringing!

382
00:20:05,651 --> 00:20:08,381
Where is my mobile?
- Want some more water?

383
00:20:08,454 --> 00:20:09,512
Here!
- Dispirin!

384
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:11,948
What is happening to you?

385
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,518
What has happened to you?

386
00:20:18,631 --> 00:20:21,395
I think my mobile is ringing.
- Your mobile is not ringing!

387
00:20:22,001 --> 00:20:23,525
I think my wife is
continuously calling me.

388
00:20:23,602 --> 00:20:24,864
What do I do?
- Just a minute.

389
00:20:25,004 --> 00:20:26,972
What happened?
- Let me do Shirshaasan (yoga).

390
00:20:27,406 --> 00:20:28,464
Shirshaasan!

391
00:20:29,842 --> 00:20:30,968
Are you sure?
- It's ringing continuously.

392
00:20:31,043 --> 00:20:32,408
What are you doing? Sir!

393
00:20:32,545 --> 00:20:33,603
Oh, God!

394
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,513
Are you all right, sir?

395
00:20:37,783 --> 00:20:39,410
Why don't you say something?

396
00:20:39,885 --> 00:20:40,943
Oh, God!

397
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,078
Sir!

398
00:20:42,421 --> 00:20:44,355
I am deteriorating!

399
00:20:44,423 --> 00:20:47,824
I was afraid. I hoped he
didn't really have a heart attack.

400
00:20:49,361 --> 00:20:52,421
Imagine! My boss,
dead in my own house!

401
00:20:52,498 --> 00:20:53,556
God!

402
00:20:53,933 --> 00:20:55,423
'Did you meet again? '

403
00:20:57,369 --> 00:20:58,461
Yes.

404
00:20:58,537 --> 00:20:59,697
We met a month later.

405
00:21:00,372 --> 00:21:01,430
In my house.

406
00:21:02,641 --> 00:21:04,836
He did a lot of
things this time around.

407
00:21:07,046 --> 00:21:08,445
And then I got a promotion.

408
00:21:09,648 --> 00:21:11,115
Then I lost interest in him.

409
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:13,745
And, Mita? She's cold in bed?

410
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:17,111
What's so surprising?
She's of the intellectual type.

411
00:21:17,456 --> 00:21:19,048
You know more about her?

412
00:21:19,391 --> 00:21:21,120
Samit mentioned it. That's it.

413
00:21:22,061 --> 00:21:23,119
And me?

414
00:21:23,662 --> 00:21:25,789
What did you tell Samit about me?

415
00:21:27,466 --> 00:21:28,899
Why would I tell him about you?

416
00:21:29,868 --> 00:21:31,130
There's nothing wrong with you.

417
00:21:32,404 --> 00:21:33,735
I love you and we're fine.

418
00:21:34,506 --> 00:21:36,770
But you said I'm not very extrovert.

419
00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:38,603
My God!

420
00:21:38,978 --> 00:21:41,469
You still remember such an
old matter. - You did say it.

421
00:21:41,547 --> 00:21:44,641
I said it casually.
Fine, now I'm saying sorry.

422
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:51,886
Rishi, do you feel
like going to such girls?

423
00:21:52,891 --> 00:21:53,949
No.

424
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,618
Never!

425
00:21:55,694 --> 00:21:56,752
Sure?

426
00:21:57,496 --> 00:21:59,123
You're really in a strange mood.

427
00:21:59,765 --> 00:22:01,790
I mean, they are
separating and you doubt me!

428
00:22:05,004 --> 00:22:06,631
Can we ever split?

429
00:22:10,843 --> 00:22:12,105
I've never thought about it.

430
00:22:13,445 --> 00:22:15,140
Did you?

431
00:22:17,616 --> 00:22:18,674
No.

432
00:22:26,725 --> 00:22:27,783
Let's do it.

433
00:22:29,528 --> 00:22:30,586
What?

434
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:32,188
You know.

435
00:22:35,901 --> 00:22:39,564
I'm not a machine. I
should be in the mood.

436
00:22:39,638 --> 00:22:41,538
You'll get in the mood. Don't worry.

437
00:22:41,674 --> 00:22:42,732
Take a shower.

438
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:47,538
Will you refuse
after I take a shower?

439
00:22:47,613 --> 00:22:48,671
Why would I?

440
00:22:49,748 --> 00:22:51,147
You don't trust anyone, do you?

441
00:22:51,483 --> 00:22:53,951
You're telling me to
take a shower at 1am.

442
00:22:54,486 --> 00:22:55,714
I hope you don't change your mind.

443
00:22:56,789 --> 00:22:59,917
Then let's not do it.
Nobody is forcing you.

444
00:23:06,832 --> 00:23:08,493
'After her separation with Samit...

445
00:23:08,567 --> 00:23:10,967
...Mita went on a date
with her colleague, Rajat.'

446
00:23:11,503 --> 00:23:13,698
'Rajat was in love with Mita.'

447
00:23:15,507 --> 00:23:16,565
Hey!
- Hi!

448
00:23:16,642 --> 00:23:17,836
Hi! Come in!

449
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,707
How are you?
- I'm fine. You're looking good.

450
00:23:19,778 --> 00:23:20,836
Thank you.

451
00:23:23,515 --> 00:23:25,574
Oh, God! Sorry!
- It's okay.

452
00:23:32,091 --> 00:23:34,184
Yes! Hello!

453
00:23:36,829 --> 00:23:38,854
Sorry.
- Welcome to my rented palace!

454
00:23:39,531 --> 00:23:40,589
It's very nice.

455
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:42,634
I hoped you'd really
like it. Anyway, hey!

456
00:23:42,835 --> 00:23:44,803
I have two tickets for the play.
- Really? Great!

457
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,701
My friend has written
the dialogues of this play.

458
00:23:46,772 --> 00:23:48,740
Really? That's great!

459
00:23:51,744 --> 00:23:52,836
Are you all right?

460
00:23:52,978 --> 00:23:54,036
Yes, I'm fine.

461
00:23:54,113 --> 00:23:55,876
Should I get you something?
- No. - Some water?

462
00:23:55,948 --> 00:23:58,280
Actually, can I make a call?
- Sure!

463
00:23:59,618 --> 00:24:00,915
From the other room?
- Please!

464
00:24:00,986 --> 00:24:02,886
Sorry! Just a minute.

465
00:24:16,568 --> 00:24:18,001
Hello!
- Yes?

466
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:20,766
I was trying to call you.
I never got connected.

467
00:24:20,973 --> 00:24:22,031
I was inside.

468
00:24:24,109 --> 00:24:27,237
So, how are you?

469
00:24:27,579 --> 00:24:29,638
I'm fine. I'm perfectly fine.

470
00:24:29,715 --> 00:24:31,808
No, I was just concerned,
Mita. Are you okay?

471
00:24:31,884 --> 00:24:33,146
I said I'm fine.

472
00:24:41,593 --> 00:24:43,652
Samit! Are you okay?

473
00:24:43,729 --> 00:24:44,821
Yes! No. Yes.

474
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:50,261
I miss you, Mita! I miss you.

475
00:24:50,335 --> 00:24:51,666
Are you crying?

476
00:24:52,671 --> 00:24:54,298
I'm mad.

477
00:24:57,109 --> 00:25:00,340
I don't know why I start to cry.

478
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:01,737
Maybe I don't deserve you.

479
00:25:01,814 --> 00:25:02,872
It's okay.

480
00:25:02,948 --> 00:25:04,006
Its okay, Samit.

481
00:25:04,082 --> 00:25:10,248
No, you don't understand.
I feel like crying out loud.

482
00:25:11,356 --> 00:25:13,688
It's okay. Its okay, Samit.

483
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:15,090
Just calm down.

484
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,685
Everything is fine. I'm not
going anywhere. I'm right here.

485
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:20,757
Please don't cry.
I can't see you crying.

486
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:24,269
I just realised that
we are connected, Mita.

487
00:25:26,638 --> 00:25:27,696
We are connected...

488
00:25:30,776 --> 00:25:32,744
I know, just listen.
- Yes.

489
00:25:32,811 --> 00:25:36,713
We both know this living
separately is not working for us.

490
00:25:36,849 --> 00:25:38,714
Let's try to get back together.

491
00:25:38,784 --> 00:25:40,081
Then, you...
- Yes.

492
00:25:40,152 --> 00:25:41,210
Everything will be fine.

493
00:25:41,286 --> 00:25:43,254
Just like the day
we had first met. - I'll call.

494
00:25:43,655 --> 00:25:44,815
I'm coming to pick you up right now.

495
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:45,948
No! No!

496
00:25:46,024 --> 00:25:47,389
We can't live without each other.

497
00:25:49,061 --> 00:25:52,394
No, no! I'll be there!

498
00:25:52,731 --> 00:25:54,722
No, I will come to you.

499
00:25:55,667 --> 00:25:56,998
Where are you?

500
00:25:57,236 --> 00:26:00,069
Office! - I'll prepare
your favourite Hakka noodles.

501
00:26:01,206 --> 00:26:04,801
And then at night we'll
hug and sleep together.

502
00:26:07,112 --> 00:26:08,875
We'll make it a
really special day, Samit.

503
00:26:08,947 --> 00:26:13,680
No, no! Mita, I said it casually.
But it doesn't happen all the time.

504
00:26:13,752 --> 00:26:16,744
Where are you? I'll
come right away. - Mita!

505
00:26:16,822 --> 00:26:18,187
I can't leave you alone
in this big bad world.

506
00:26:18,257 --> 00:26:19,315
Why don't you understand?

507
00:26:19,391 --> 00:26:22,827
I'm okay.
- Will you have coffee?

508
00:26:27,432 --> 00:26:30,697
Samit, you are
living-in with her, aren't you?

509
00:26:30,769 --> 00:26:32,202
No! No!

510
00:26:32,271 --> 00:26:33,898
Don't lie! I know you are.

511
00:26:34,873 --> 00:26:36,431
That's why you
wanted to live separately.

512
00:26:36,708 --> 00:26:37,902
So that you can live with her.

513
00:26:38,777 --> 00:26:41,439
It's been just a week. And
you've settled down with her?

514
00:26:41,713 --> 00:26:42,771
No! Never!

515
00:26:42,848 --> 00:26:44,338
You had planned it much earlier.

516
00:26:44,416 --> 00:26:45,781
No!
- You had it yesterday!

517
00:26:45,918 --> 00:26:47,943
Never! - Oh, no,
Samit! Don't talk nonsense!

518
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,815
You've been meeting her
much before this. I know it!

519
00:26:50,389 --> 00:26:52,983
I knew something was
bound to happen. But so soon?

520
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:55,153
God Samit! You're such a liar!

521
00:26:59,831 --> 00:27:01,196
Are you all right?
- Yes.

522
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,958
Any personal problem?
- I'm fine.

523
00:27:04,736 --> 00:27:05,794
Where are we going?

524
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:12,836
It's an English
adaptation of Kamasutra. - What?

525
00:27:13,345 --> 00:27:14,835
Kamasutra?
- Yes.

526
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:18,108
I consider it as yogic science.
- Rubbish Rajat!

527
00:27:23,822 --> 00:27:25,255
I want to watch this play.

528
00:27:25,958 --> 00:27:28,222
I won't stop living
because of someone else.

529
00:27:32,164 --> 00:27:33,324
Just give me one second.

530
00:27:40,038 --> 00:27:41,403
Don't move!

531
00:27:42,174 --> 00:27:43,232
I'll pick it up.

532
00:27:46,778 --> 00:27:47,836
Mita!

533
00:27:51,216 --> 00:27:54,049
It's me!
- Hi! Long time!

534
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:55,177
What?

535
00:27:55,287 --> 00:27:56,345
Hi!

536
00:27:56,421 --> 00:27:57,854
I know who that girl is?

537
00:27:58,357 --> 00:28:01,155
The same girl for whom you
go to Bangalore so often!

538
00:28:01,927 --> 00:28:03,121
Yes! No!

539
00:28:04,196 --> 00:28:05,857
You've been eyeing her.

540
00:28:06,131 --> 00:28:07,291
Yes. What?

541
00:28:07,366 --> 00:28:08,424
She's a gym instructor, isn't she?

542
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:12,327
That's why you started
going to gym every morning.

543
00:28:12,804 --> 00:28:13,862
She works in your gym.

544
00:28:14,373 --> 00:28:17,399
I had never thought you
would hide so much from me.

545
00:28:17,476 --> 00:28:19,068
I thought it was a
temporary state of affairs.

546
00:28:19,277 --> 00:28:22,212
Hello! - I never thought you
would fall for someone else.

547
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,975
My back!

548
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,184
I thought we'd use this time
to understand our relationship.

549
00:28:27,252 --> 00:28:29,880
Hello!
- Where we went wrong!

550
00:28:30,489 --> 00:28:31,888
Hello... hello!
- God Samit!

551
00:28:31,957 --> 00:28:34,016
You wanted to bring someone
else in your life. - Mama!

552
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,823
I rejected the advice of
my friends and parents...

553
00:28:36,895 --> 00:28:38,089
...and married you.
- I can't hear anything.

554
00:28:38,163 --> 00:28:39,892
I think I made a grave mistake.

555
00:28:39,965 --> 00:28:43,901
I didn't know you'd cheat on me!
You lied to me, Samit. - Hello.

556
00:28:43,969 --> 00:28:45,027
You filthy, dirty...

557
00:28:45,103 --> 00:28:46,161
One minute...

558
00:28:46,238 --> 00:28:48,229
Hello!
- You deserve to be alone!

559
00:28:48,507 --> 00:28:50,907
I hate you! I wish we had never met!

560
00:28:50,976 --> 00:28:52,034
I don't understand...

561
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:54,044
- I don't want to ever
see your face again in my life!

562
00:28:54,246 --> 00:28:56,976
I'll burn your photographs! I'll
throw away your clothes! - Hello.

563
00:28:57,282 --> 00:28:59,580
Hello! Hello.

564
00:28:59,918 --> 00:29:00,976
You're such a liar!

565
00:29:08,927 --> 00:29:10,019
When does the play start?

566
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:13,955
I don't feel like going to the play.

567
00:29:14,433 --> 00:29:15,923
I'm feeling a bit upset.

568
00:29:17,002 --> 00:29:20,130
You? Why are you upset?

569
00:29:21,073 --> 00:29:22,165
You men!

570
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,538
A girl gets a bit older
and everything changes.

571
00:29:24,609 --> 00:29:27,271
I was...
- Don't defend yourself, Rajat.

572
00:29:27,612 --> 00:29:31,013
Till the girl is young,
everything is beautiful.

573
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:34,211
No! No! - After that all
that men want is variety.

574
00:29:34,352 --> 00:29:35,546
You're misunderstanding me.

575
00:29:36,154 --> 00:29:38,622
Mita, you're very
beautiful for any age.

576
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:40,551
I mean, for anyone.

577
00:29:41,993 --> 00:29:44,962
Strong beginning and a strong end.

578
00:29:45,297 --> 00:29:46,958
I'll see you next week. Thank you.

579
00:29:58,443 --> 00:29:59,501
Thank you.

580
00:30:12,491 --> 00:30:15,085
Raga, one minute.

581
00:30:20,665 --> 00:30:23,133
I've read your script.
It's quite good.

582
00:30:23,401 --> 00:30:25,096
Really?
- I was impressed.

583
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:29,004
In fact, I feel this would be
the best script of this semester.

584
00:30:29,141 --> 00:30:30,199
Great!

585
00:30:30,942 --> 00:30:33,001
Good language.
Strong dramatic points.

586
00:30:33,078 --> 00:30:36,047
It was a tight narrative structure.
It was impressive.

587
00:30:37,516 --> 00:30:40,576
Look, I mean it. It's a complement.

588
00:30:40,952 --> 00:30:43,420
Nothing else. I mean,
don't take it any other way.

589
00:30:44,489 --> 00:30:48,220
Look, it's true there are many
professors who are womanizers.

590
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,485
They think they are lady-killers.

591
00:30:51,062 --> 00:30:54,190
They flirt with female students.
Complement them. I mean.

592
00:30:54,266 --> 00:30:56,029
It's pathetic!

593
00:30:56,101 --> 00:30:57,261
But it happens.

594
00:30:57,669 --> 00:31:00,297
I haven't done it.
I can never do it.

595
00:31:00,372 --> 00:31:03,239
I'm married. Why
should I cheat Simi?

596
00:31:03,341 --> 00:31:04,399
So!

597
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:07,435
What does Raga mean?

598
00:31:07,979 --> 00:31:10,345
My mother, she
loves Indian classical.

599
00:31:10,415 --> 00:31:11,609
She has a whole library.

600
00:31:11,683 --> 00:31:14,117
Oh! As in, Raga?
- Yes. - Sorry.

601
00:31:14,452 --> 00:31:17,319
Is your whole family artistic?

602
00:31:17,989 --> 00:31:19,251
Arty? No!

603
00:31:19,991 --> 00:31:21,049
My dad's a diplomat.

604
00:31:21,126 --> 00:31:23,151
Mom's a professor
at National college.

605
00:31:25,063 --> 00:31:32,435
So, Raga, are you married? Or
are you married and divorced?

606
00:31:32,504 --> 00:31:36,065
Or is it just that, your
whole family is just wild?

607
00:31:36,408 --> 00:31:39,536
Wow! I didn't know I was wild.

608
00:31:39,744 --> 00:31:43,475
No! You're... you're
not wild. I'm just...

609
00:31:43,548 --> 00:31:48,144
Your writing is very passionate.

610
00:31:49,221 --> 00:31:51,746
I don't know. It's just a trick.

611
00:31:52,257 --> 00:31:54,088
A trick?
- Yes.

612
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,153
When I was in school, I had
written an article on Paris.

613
00:31:58,096 --> 00:31:59,563
I've never been to Paris.

614
00:32:00,265 --> 00:32:02,529
You just don't
need to. It's a trick.

615
00:32:04,035 --> 00:32:06,560
So you can write anything?

616
00:32:10,609 --> 00:32:15,103
But there was a girl. Many
years back, before marriage.

617
00:32:16,581 --> 00:32:17,707
Her name was Juhi.

618
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:21,109
Juhi was the greatest...
What can I say?

619
00:32:21,186 --> 00:32:23,120
She was the greatest...

620
00:32:27,459 --> 00:32:28,585
She loved physical intimacy.

621
00:32:31,496 --> 00:32:33,157
'We did it anywhere we wanted.'

622
00:32:33,265 --> 00:32:34,562
'Seriously! '
- You naughty boy!

623
00:32:34,633 --> 00:32:39,730
'Gardens, people's houses,
balcony, roofs, car, buses.'

624
00:32:39,804 --> 00:32:43,137
Hit me! - 'Yes! I swear,
in buses.' - Hit me!

625
00:32:43,208 --> 00:32:44,266
I'm going to teach you a lesson!

626
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:49,637
She was complex and so beautiful.

627
00:32:50,148 --> 00:32:55,450
I don't know why I'm
attracted to such girls.

628
00:32:57,088 --> 00:33:00,524
I call them suicide bombers.

629
00:33:01,092 --> 00:33:06,359
Because they run into
you and they take you down.

630
00:33:08,767 --> 00:33:12,168
Just a little bit of connection
and my imagination runs wild!

631
00:33:12,237 --> 00:33:15,206
I can't help it. I'm a writer.
I'm a filmmaker.

632
00:33:15,273 --> 00:33:17,173
I'm a creative guy, you know.

633
00:33:17,242 --> 00:33:18,300
Perhaps this is...

634
00:33:21,112 --> 00:33:25,173
But crossing the
line now? Lmpossible.

635
00:33:25,784 --> 00:33:26,842
I'm married.

636
00:33:27,452 --> 00:33:30,114
Anyway... 'Rishi said
after splitting with Mita...

637
00:33:30,188 --> 00:33:31,849
...Samit just disappeared.'

638
00:33:32,257 --> 00:33:33,485
'He never used to take my call.'

639
00:33:33,858 --> 00:33:36,326
So, let me take time, baby.

640
00:33:37,162 --> 00:33:39,221
'We used to spend
more time with Mita.'

641
00:33:39,497 --> 00:33:41,226
Because, you know...
'Mita was very depressed.'

642
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,233
Ready for tomorrow.

643
00:33:43,702 --> 00:33:45,567
Let's go upstairs! - Yes.

644
00:33:46,137 --> 00:33:48,332
Samit?
- Oh no!

645
00:33:55,146 --> 00:33:56,204
Samit!

646
00:34:00,552 --> 00:34:05,649
Hi!
- Come on! - I'll introduce.

647
00:34:06,658 --> 00:34:09,252
Hi!
- Hi!

648
00:34:10,562 --> 00:34:12,393
He is Rishi.
- Hello! - Hi!

649
00:34:12,497 --> 00:34:13,828
She is Simi.
- Hi! - Hi!

650
00:34:19,504 --> 00:34:20,835
Mita!
- Hi!

651
00:34:27,212 --> 00:34:28,440
I...
- What happened?

652
00:34:28,713 --> 00:34:29,771
I have to go.

653
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:35,847
I have an appointment.

654
00:34:36,187 --> 00:34:37,245
Appointment?

655
00:34:37,589 --> 00:34:38,647
What about lunch?

656
00:34:39,224 --> 00:34:40,816
Mita, lunch...
- I have to go.

657
00:34:44,229 --> 00:34:45,924
Some coincidence, yes?
- Yes!

658
00:34:49,868 --> 00:34:51,563
Sorry, what was your name again?

659
00:34:51,736 --> 00:34:52,930
Kaya!
- Kaya! - Kaya!

660
00:34:53,605 --> 00:34:55,937
Sorry.
- God!

661
00:34:57,809 --> 00:34:58,867
Kaya...

662
00:35:04,749 --> 00:35:05,807
Bandra!

663
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:09,545
So, what do you do, Kaya?

664
00:35:09,654 --> 00:35:10,712
She's a trainer!
- Aerobics!

665
00:35:11,256 --> 00:35:13,247
Trainer? - Yes.
- Aerobics and also a trainer.

666
00:35:13,591 --> 00:35:14,649
Aerobics trainer.

667
00:35:14,826 --> 00:35:16,726
And, why don't you come for dinner?

668
00:35:17,295 --> 00:35:18,387
She's a great cook.

669
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:22,324
You'll love it. - I've prepared
vegetarian food today. - Please.

670
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,534
Not today.
- Not today.

671
00:35:24,769 --> 00:35:26,327
Let's have Chaat
(snacks) this evening then.

672
00:35:27,739 --> 00:35:30,640
Yes baby, I want to
have Dahi-bhalle (snacks).

673
00:35:30,708 --> 00:35:32,539
Or you want to cook something?
No actually...

674
00:35:32,644 --> 00:35:33,872
Whatever you say, baby!

675
00:35:35,947 --> 00:35:38,541
My mother has come.
- Yes.

676
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:41,585
It's all right, bring her with you.
She'll have a great time.

677
00:35:41,653 --> 00:35:44,986
No, she has an eye infection.
- Chest infection!

678
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:52,457
Okay. - Anyway, since we are here,
shall we get coffee?

679
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:55,827
Yes, there's a beautiful store
here. I also want to buy tamarind.

680
00:35:55,934 --> 00:35:56,992
Let's go together.

681
00:35:57,268 --> 00:35:58,565
Should we?
- Come on!

682
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,934
I'll just come. Come on!
- Okay.

683
00:36:03,408 --> 00:36:05,342
Why don't you take
my calls, you fool?

684
00:36:05,643 --> 00:36:06,701
Rubbish!
- What?

685
00:36:06,811 --> 00:36:08,938
I keep calling you. You
don't pick up. Please.

686
00:36:09,414 --> 00:36:11,006
Did you change your number?
- Please! One second!

687
00:36:11,616 --> 00:36:13,015
And what's all this?
- What?

688
00:36:13,284 --> 00:36:14,911
What's all this? Who
do you think you are?

689
00:36:15,019 --> 00:36:17,010
Will Smith! Men in Black!
What's going on?

690
00:36:18,389 --> 00:36:20,949
Come on, Samit! Is this
your second childhood?

691
00:36:21,626 --> 00:36:22,888
You've started
having Chaat! Since when?

692
00:36:22,994 --> 00:36:24,552
Explore man! Explore!
- You're crazy!

693
00:36:24,662 --> 00:36:25,856
You've gone crazy!

694
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:26,988
Listen! Listen!

695
00:36:27,365 --> 00:36:29,333
Boss, she's fantastic!

696
00:36:30,368 --> 00:36:33,030
Her family has come from Jalandhar.

697
00:36:33,972 --> 00:36:35,337
And her father is a policeman.

698
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,737
You left Mita for her?

699
00:36:36,841 --> 00:36:37,899
I'm shocked!

700
00:36:37,976 --> 00:36:39,034
Listen, you are a friend.

701
00:36:39,344 --> 00:36:40,572
Listen! Listen to me.

702
00:36:40,979 --> 00:36:42,037
It's not too late.

703
00:36:42,647 --> 00:36:43,705
Call Mita.

704
00:36:44,682 --> 00:36:45,774
I think she still loves you.

705
00:36:45,884 --> 00:36:47,374
Yes. Listen, I
don't need your advice.

706
00:36:47,685 --> 00:36:48,743
You're not a saint!

707
00:36:48,987 --> 00:36:50,045
Yes, you're not a saint.

708
00:36:50,321 --> 00:36:53,051
Excuse me! We're not
talking about me. But about you.

709
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:54,655
We're talking about you,
stick to the topic.

710
00:36:54,826 --> 00:36:55,884
Mita is a lovely girl.

711
00:36:55,994 --> 00:36:58,053
Yes, she's a bit quarrelsome...
- A bit quarrelsome?

712
00:36:58,696 --> 00:37:00,391
A bit quarrelsome? Do
you know her better? I do.

713
00:37:00,465 --> 00:37:01,591
I've lived with her.
You don't know her.

714
00:37:01,699 --> 00:37:02,757
I don't know her.
- Yes!

715
00:37:02,867 --> 00:37:05,768
Tell me a shocking thing about her.
- Shocking? Thing?

716
00:37:05,937 --> 00:37:07,495
I can't tell you.
- Yes!

717
00:37:08,006 --> 00:37:10,566
Come on... I just... I don't
want to hurt Mita. - Yes.

718
00:37:10,842 --> 00:37:11,968
I'd never want to hurt Mita.

719
00:37:12,076 --> 00:37:13,543
That's why you've got an item girl.

720
00:37:13,711 --> 00:37:15,406
Don't call her an item girl?
- What?

721
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,942
Don't call her an item girl? Please!

722
00:37:17,081 --> 00:37:19,345
She was a student of
psychiatry and... - Psychiatry?

723
00:37:19,417 --> 00:37:22,011
Now, she teaches aerobics.

724
00:37:22,086 --> 00:37:25,078
And she makes me feel relaxed.

725
00:37:25,356 --> 00:37:27,688
You know. Mita
used to stress me out!

726
00:37:28,026 --> 00:37:30,085
I used to be
stressed all the time! Why?

727
00:37:30,395 --> 00:37:31,453
Why should I be stressed?

728
00:37:32,363 --> 00:37:35,093
All her friends are arty type.
Interior decorators!

729
00:37:35,366 --> 00:37:36,628
How many art films can I watch?

730
00:37:36,768 --> 00:37:38,099
I was tried of watching art films!

731
00:37:38,503 --> 00:37:39,629
I love Mita!

732
00:37:39,971 --> 00:37:41,802
I love Mita but she was cold.

733
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:44,941
She was never in the mood.

734
00:37:45,743 --> 00:37:47,370
If I placed the ash-tray wrongly...

735
00:37:47,445 --> 00:37:50,881
...I used to feel I've committed
a murder. I've killed somebody!

736
00:37:50,982 --> 00:37:53,382
And it took you two years
to know that? Two years?

737
00:37:54,385 --> 00:37:55,443
Two...

738
00:37:55,887 --> 00:37:57,377
Yes.
- Yes!

739
00:37:57,455 --> 00:38:00,652
I mean, I accept my mistake.
It took me two years.

740
00:38:00,825 --> 00:38:03,453
I mean... I'm not a snob.

741
00:38:03,761 --> 00:38:05,126
My feelings a very clear.

742
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:06,954
I'm not a snob. I don't like art.

743
00:38:07,065 --> 00:38:10,557
And I want
somebody who can have fun.

744
00:38:10,768 --> 00:38:11,996
Who loves life!
- You don't have to be a snob.

745
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:14,538
Who can scream! Who can shout!

746
00:38:14,772 --> 00:38:16,569
She's just...
- Who can love life like that!

747
00:38:19,844 --> 00:38:23,473
She screams?

748
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:27,608
I never knew
something like this happens.

749
00:38:28,586 --> 00:38:29,848
She's wonderful!

750
00:38:30,421 --> 00:38:32,150
You know what she did yesterday?

751
00:38:32,523 --> 00:38:41,158
Good! Good!

752
00:38:41,432 --> 00:38:43,525
Good night!

753
00:38:43,801 --> 00:38:46,497
Good! Good!

754
00:38:46,838 --> 00:38:49,068
My fantasy! Come and see.

755
00:38:49,173 --> 00:38:50,640
My fantasy!

756
00:38:50,742 --> 00:38:51,800
Good night!

757
00:38:51,909 --> 00:38:54,002
My fantasy! Come and see.

758
00:38:54,112 --> 00:38:56,774
My fantasy!

759
00:38:56,881 --> 00:38:58,746
My fantasy! Come and see.

760
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:00,681
My fantasy!

761
00:39:00,785 --> 00:39:01,843
Goodnight!

762
00:39:01,919 --> 00:39:03,580
My fantasy! Come and see.

763
00:39:03,721 --> 00:39:05,018
My fantasy!

764
00:39:05,123 --> 00:39:06,181
Goodnight!

765
00:39:06,457 --> 00:39:10,553
If I were a pizza-delivery boy...

766
00:39:10,862 --> 00:39:14,923
I would be hot with
you in 20 minutes.

767
00:39:15,833 --> 00:39:20,668
You'd open the door with a
smile when I ring the bell.

768
00:39:20,838 --> 00:39:25,901
Buy one get one more free.
There would be different offers.

769
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:27,568
My fantasy! Come and see.

770
00:39:27,845 --> 00:39:29,540
My fantasy!

771
00:39:29,647 --> 00:39:32,480
Goodnight! My fantasy! Come and see.

772
00:39:32,617 --> 00:39:34,551
My fantasy!

773
00:39:35,053 --> 00:39:37,044
You are so beautiful, my darling.

774
00:39:37,155 --> 00:39:39,589
I want to look at you all the time.

775
00:39:39,857 --> 00:39:41,984
You are so beautiful, my darling.

776
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,550
I want to look at you...

777
00:39:54,172 --> 00:39:57,505
Assume I am a nurse.

778
00:39:59,077 --> 00:40:02,171
Let me check your pulse.

779
00:40:03,948 --> 00:40:06,178
Assume I am a nurse.

780
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:08,810
Let me check your pulse.

781
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,013
You're not breathing.

782
00:40:11,622 --> 00:40:13,954
Let me take your breaths.

783
00:40:14,058 --> 00:40:17,960
I'll put you on glucose.

784
00:40:18,262 --> 00:40:22,824
And decorate the bed with red roses.

785
00:40:32,944 --> 00:40:34,002
Please! Please!

786
00:40:34,145 --> 00:40:35,203
Stop it! Stop it!

787
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:40,608
And, yes!

788
00:40:40,918 --> 00:40:44,046
Your mother didn't come.
She's in Delhi. I know.

789
00:40:47,158 --> 00:40:49,285
'How long did your
affair with Simi last? '

790
00:40:54,065 --> 00:40:55,123
Four years.

791
00:40:55,767 --> 00:40:57,667
'But what happened? '

792
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:05,175
No matter how hard we tried,
our relationship never worked.

793
00:41:05,576 --> 00:41:06,634
'Why did you split? '

794
00:41:06,744 --> 00:41:09,304
I wanted to. I
couldn't take it anymore.

795
00:41:09,614 --> 00:41:13,311
But now I feel Simi wanted to split.

796
00:41:13,651 --> 00:41:15,312
'So, she left you? '

797
00:41:17,255 --> 00:41:18,847
That was not her style.

798
00:41:19,957 --> 00:41:21,652
Simi can drive anyone crazy.

799
00:41:22,026 --> 00:41:23,084
She fights back with silence.

800
00:41:23,828 --> 00:41:25,955
Basically, passive aggressive types.

801
00:41:26,164 --> 00:41:28,689
All the time they feel
they are helpless. Why me?

802
00:41:28,966 --> 00:41:30,024
Don't do this to me?

803
00:41:31,335 --> 00:41:33,235
When she met Rishi for the
first time... listen to this.

804
00:41:34,272 --> 00:41:35,671
When she met Rishi
for the first time...

805
00:41:39,777 --> 00:41:41,074
When did you come here?

806
00:41:41,212 --> 00:41:43,703
This morning. With everyone.
- All right.

807
00:41:44,282 --> 00:41:46,648
You mean...
- With my colleagues.

808
00:41:46,984 --> 00:41:48,042
My colleagues are sitting there.

809
00:41:48,686 --> 00:41:50,711
They'll be here for
the weekend. But...

810
00:41:51,355 --> 00:41:52,617
I'm going to leave.
- Yes...

811
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:53,748
I have lots of work.
- Same here.

812
00:41:54,792 --> 00:41:58,353
I have a car. Would you like a lift?

813
00:41:58,996 --> 00:42:01,226
No. It's okay. I'll take a train.

814
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,995
Why would you? I have a car!

815
00:42:04,202 --> 00:42:05,692
I'll drop you. - No, that's okay.

816
00:42:05,803 --> 00:42:07,168
That's okay!
- Sure?

817
00:42:07,238 --> 00:42:09,001
I'm very comfortable
taking a train. Really?

818
00:42:10,074 --> 00:42:11,132
Where do you live?

819
00:42:11,242 --> 00:42:12,300
Colaba. And you?

820
00:42:12,977 --> 00:42:14,205
Colaba is too far.

821
00:42:14,645 --> 00:42:15,839
So where do you stay?

822
00:42:16,147 --> 00:42:19,048
I live in Bandra.
- Don't be silly! - Town? - No. No...

823
00:42:19,383 --> 00:42:20,645
I'll drop you. - I'll take a train.
- Take the highway to Bandra...

824
00:42:20,718 --> 00:42:21,912
There's no problem.

825
00:42:22,653 --> 00:42:23,711
Its okay, I'll take a train.

826
00:42:24,155 --> 00:42:29,252
Kebabs by Karim! - My God!
Believe me! This street food is...

827
00:42:30,995 --> 00:42:32,394
Actually, you know,
I'm feeling quite hungry.

828
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:34,188
Can you come over there?

829
00:42:34,265 --> 00:42:36,699
Because they are serving
something there. - No.

830
00:42:37,034 --> 00:42:38,092
No thanks.
- No?

831
00:42:40,271 --> 00:42:42,262
Sorry! Do you want something?

832
00:42:42,673 --> 00:42:43,731
I'll get it.

833
00:42:44,041 --> 00:42:46,669
No, I didn't mean that.
- No, I'm sorry.

834
00:42:47,011 --> 00:42:48,672
No, not at all!

835
00:42:48,813 --> 00:42:51,111
All right, look...
- I was just saying... I'll get it.

836
00:42:51,716 --> 00:42:53,343
I'll check out the deserts.
For myself.

837
00:42:53,417 --> 00:42:54,679
No!
- What about you? Have something...

838
00:42:54,752 --> 00:42:56,276
Please don't bother!
Please don't bother!

839
00:42:56,354 --> 00:42:57,412
I'll have it later.

840
00:42:57,722 --> 00:43:00,020
Okay, they have Chicken
Tikka (barbecue) and salad.

841
00:43:00,224 --> 00:43:03,751
Salad? Let's have salad.
You want salad. - No thanks!

842
00:43:04,061 --> 00:43:05,221
Won't you drink anything?

843
00:43:09,033 --> 00:43:11,058
Sorry! Sorry, what will you have?

844
00:43:11,202 --> 00:43:13,227
No! - Soft drink. Juice. -
I didn't mean it like that.

845
00:43:13,738 --> 00:43:14,932
No, I...
- Soft drink?

846
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:16,165
Soft drink is fine.
- Okay.

847
00:43:16,307 --> 00:43:19,333
And listen! I'll get a
taxi to the railway station.

848
00:43:19,443 --> 00:43:21,274
Please don't bother.
I'll take a taxi.

849
00:43:21,379 --> 00:43:24,439
What are you saying? I have
a car. It's done! That's it!

850
00:43:24,715 --> 00:43:25,841
Are you sure?
- Yes.

851
00:43:26,984 --> 00:43:28,884
He brought her salad.

852
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:32,346
Then he changed his
plans and dropped her home.

853
00:43:32,456 --> 00:43:35,323
And all the time she
kept saying, 'lt's okay.'

854
00:43:35,393 --> 00:43:37,054
'You don't have to, you know.'

855
00:43:37,194 --> 00:43:40,789
'Lt's Mumbai! I'll manage.
Don't worry! '

856
00:43:41,832 --> 00:43:43,163
Amazing girl!

857
00:43:44,168 --> 00:43:46,728
But didn't he tell you that
there was nothing between us...

858
00:43:46,804 --> 00:43:49,034
...in the last two
years of our relationship?

859
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:50,334
I mean nothing.

860
00:43:51,742 --> 00:43:53,733
He was angry because...

861
00:43:53,811 --> 00:43:55,335
...I didn't turn out to
be as he had thought.

862
00:43:56,414 --> 00:43:59,008
He was searching for
someone like his mother.

863
00:44:01,118 --> 00:44:03,086
Anyway, he was very unromantic.

864
00:44:03,154 --> 00:44:05,748
And I couldn't accept it.

865
00:44:06,991 --> 00:44:10,859
I mean, the one who gifts a
slim sauna belt on your birthday...

866
00:44:11,195 --> 00:44:15,427
Slim sauna belt? I've
never gifted a slim sauna belt.

867
00:44:15,866 --> 00:44:18,096
I gave her a treadmill
because she asked for it.

868
00:44:19,103 --> 00:44:23,199
The fact is she thought I was
not husband material. Period!

869
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,985
What are you doing?

870
00:44:39,423 --> 00:44:40,947
Nothing. I was just
going through your script.

871
00:44:41,158 --> 00:44:42,386
No, this is crap. Forget it.

872
00:44:42,526 --> 00:44:44,858
Why? Because it is about us?

873
00:44:45,162 --> 00:44:46,993
What else can I write about?

874
00:44:48,065 --> 00:44:50,533
Did you have to insult me?
- Insult?

875
00:44:51,402 --> 00:44:54,200
'Yes, the way we had met
at the party in Lonavala.'

876
00:44:54,872 --> 00:44:56,806
'The moment he met her...

877
00:44:56,874 --> 00:44:59,172
...thoughts of Juhu
rushed to his mind.'

878
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:00,809
'And all the blood in his body...

879
00:45:00,878 --> 00:45:03,870
...rushed somewhere in his legs.'

880
00:45:04,181 --> 00:45:05,808
'But when he
finally got to know her...

881
00:45:05,883 --> 00:45:07,874
...all the dreams evaporated.'

882
00:45:13,824 --> 00:45:14,882
She was me, isn't it?

883
00:45:15,192 --> 00:45:18,559
That's right. She
was not wild like Juhi.

884
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:20,424
But she was boring like me.

885
00:45:21,165 --> 00:45:22,826
She's the best woman in the script...

886
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:23,958
...that's why he married her.

887
00:45:25,102 --> 00:45:26,160
And he regretted it.

888
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:28,895
Look, its crap. I
was going to throw it.

889
00:45:29,273 --> 00:45:31,173
I didn't tell you to throw it away.

890
00:45:31,909 --> 00:45:34,571
It's very nice. Keep it.
It's artistic. - Yes!

891
00:45:34,845 --> 00:45:38,337
Look! Please, I know you
think this script is mediocre.

892
00:45:38,883 --> 00:45:40,851
What do you understand other than...

893
00:45:40,918 --> 00:45:42,852
Dear Agony aunt Simi,
my name is Rajat...

894
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,946
I'm seventeen. And I'm
suffering from night falls.

895
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:47,248
Help me! Help me!

896
00:45:47,358 --> 00:45:48,416
Yes, help me!

897
00:45:48,526 --> 00:45:49,857
You know, I've been
made an assistant editor...

898
00:45:49,927 --> 00:45:51,588
...but you don't care
about my judgment.

899
00:45:51,862 --> 00:45:53,159
Had it been someone else,
you'd have taken it seriously.

900
00:45:53,364 --> 00:45:54,422
No! Never!

901
00:45:54,865 --> 00:45:56,025
I don't know why you
ask for my opinion...

902
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,362
...because you don't even care.

903
00:46:04,475 --> 00:46:06,909
'A few days later Mita
called Simi for lunch.'

904
00:46:07,244 --> 00:46:09,508
'And she made a
surprising announcement.'

905
00:46:11,182 --> 00:46:13,480
I like being single.
- What do you mean?

906
00:46:14,018 --> 00:46:15,417
I mean I can live without Samit.

907
00:46:15,886 --> 00:46:16,944
I don't need him.

908
00:46:17,254 --> 00:46:18,312
Wow!

909
00:46:18,389 --> 00:46:20,084
I used to think
something else about you.

910
00:46:20,991 --> 00:46:22,185
It's just an initial fear.

911
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,994
Later, I tell you,
it's a blessing. - Yes.

912
00:46:25,162 --> 00:46:27,357
I don't have to wake up
early and make coffee.

913
00:46:28,432 --> 00:46:29,626
Sleep as long as you like.

914
00:46:30,401 --> 00:46:31,629
You get fresh newspaper.

915
00:46:31,936 --> 00:46:32,994
The bathroom is not wet.

916
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:34,965
You get the TV
remote in its right place.

917
00:46:35,239 --> 00:46:36,297
The list is endless.

918
00:46:36,907 --> 00:46:37,999
I think you're right.

919
00:46:38,275 --> 00:46:39,333
Of course, I'm right.

920
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:41,036
There's one advantage of marriage.

921
00:46:41,645 --> 00:46:44,113
If I meet anyone now I
can use my experience.

922
00:46:44,281 --> 00:46:45,339
You know what.

923
00:46:46,951 --> 00:46:48,384
Sometimes even I want to be free.

924
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:50,978
I know.

925
00:46:51,288 --> 00:46:52,346
How?

926
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:57,186
You were very angry when
we split up. Me and Samit?

927
00:46:58,429 --> 00:46:59,487
No.

928
00:47:00,364 --> 00:47:01,422
You were angry.

929
00:47:01,966 --> 00:47:04,992
I was doing what you wanted to do.
- No, Mita!

930
00:47:05,136 --> 00:47:06,535
I mean, Rishi and I are fine.

931
00:47:06,604 --> 00:47:08,435
And besides not every
marriage is perfect.

932
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:10,998
That's right.

933
00:47:11,108 --> 00:47:13,599
It's a blessing even if
everything is all right.

934
00:47:13,978 --> 00:47:15,309
Anyway, forget it.

935
00:47:15,613 --> 00:47:17,205
I want you to meet someone.

936
00:47:18,215 --> 00:47:20,342
Veer? Your office colleague?

937
00:47:20,985 --> 00:47:22,350
Attractive little heartthrob!

938
00:47:22,453 --> 00:47:23,579
He just joined.

939
00:47:23,687 --> 00:47:26,485
He had a girlfriend but,
thankfully they just broke up.

940
00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:27,648
Very attractive!

941
00:47:28,125 --> 00:47:29,592
Yes! I'll introduce you right now.

942
00:47:29,693 --> 00:47:31,058
Now?
- Waiter! Yes.

943
00:47:31,295 --> 00:47:33,286
Let me finish my tea!
- Hurry up!

944
00:47:33,397 --> 00:47:36,264
If you like him, we will
all go to have dinner.

945
00:47:37,635 --> 00:47:39,034
That's it. Just do
it and show it to me.

946
00:47:39,336 --> 00:47:40,394
Thanks. - Okay.

947
00:47:41,472 --> 00:47:43,463
Hi Veer!
- Hi!

948
00:47:44,341 --> 00:47:45,467
This is my friend, Mita.

949
00:47:45,643 --> 00:47:46,701
Hi! - Hi.

950
00:47:46,977 --> 00:47:49,537
She's a cosmetic surgeon.
- Cosmetic surgeon? Wow!

951
00:47:50,314 --> 00:47:51,975
I'm totally against
cosmetic surgery but...

952
00:47:52,049 --> 00:47:53,983
...l've seen some
models in this business...

953
00:47:54,051 --> 00:47:57,077
...who look great after the
job you guys do. - Really?

954
00:47:57,354 --> 00:47:58,412
Yes.

955
00:47:58,656 --> 00:48:01,989
Some things only appear to be good.
If you know what I mean.

956
00:48:05,029 --> 00:48:07,429
I have to send a fax.
You guys carry on.

957
00:48:07,531 --> 00:48:08,589
I'll be right back.

958
00:48:08,666 --> 00:48:09,724
Okay.

959
00:48:11,735 --> 00:48:13,396
The moment I met Mita,
I fell in love with her.

960
00:48:14,071 --> 00:48:15,595
I was very attracted to her.

961
00:48:16,106 --> 00:48:17,266
She says what she feels.

962
00:48:17,608 --> 00:48:18,666
She doesn't hide anything.

963
00:48:19,376 --> 00:48:22,106
She's very beautiful.

964
00:48:23,447 --> 00:48:24,505
Please have a seat.

965
00:48:29,053 --> 00:48:31,021
In fact our magazine's
next issue is about...

966
00:48:31,088 --> 00:48:32,749
...botox versus anti aging creams.

967
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:34,148
Everyone is busy with that.

968
00:48:34,592 --> 00:48:36,025
I think what surgeons can achieve...

969
00:48:36,093 --> 00:48:39,585
...can never be
achieved by Botox and stuff.

970
00:48:40,698 --> 00:48:42,427
Even I don't think
these things are effective.

971
00:48:42,766 --> 00:48:44,666
I think a simple massage
might just do the same.

972
00:48:46,036 --> 00:48:47,094
I don't like massages.

973
00:48:47,404 --> 00:48:49,565
I find them very messy.
Very unhygienic.

974
00:48:49,707 --> 00:48:50,765
I hate them!

975
00:48:51,609 --> 00:48:53,702
'So you'd like to give
all the credit to Simi? '

976
00:48:54,044 --> 00:48:55,102
Yes, totally.

977
00:48:56,046 --> 00:48:59,038
But the fun part is when I
met Simi for the first time...

978
00:48:59,116 --> 00:49:01,107
...I thought she
was flirting with me.

979
00:49:01,418 --> 00:49:03,113
Maybe she was not
happy with her marriage.

980
00:49:04,088 --> 00:49:05,316
Then I met her husband...

981
00:49:05,389 --> 00:49:06,481
...and everything
seemed to be fine with them.

982
00:49:07,191 --> 00:49:09,159
She is like this. Very giving.

983
00:49:09,793 --> 00:49:12,785
She's done me a huge favour
by introducing me to Mita.

984
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:14,527
He just broke up.

985
00:49:14,632 --> 00:49:15,792
I know. You told me.

986
00:49:16,066 --> 00:49:17,124
I told you?

987
00:49:17,635 --> 00:49:19,364
I don't know him that well.

988
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:22,698
He is always very quiet
which I like about him.

989
00:49:23,307 --> 00:49:24,797
He has a good sense of humour.

990
00:49:25,809 --> 00:49:28,073
He gets more charming after drinks.

991
00:49:28,646 --> 00:49:30,273
Some time back we had
a party at the office.

992
00:49:31,081 --> 00:49:35,108
Just after two drinks he was just...
He started reciting poetry.

993
00:49:35,319 --> 00:49:37,184
And he also started to cry.
- Really?

994
00:49:37,454 --> 00:49:38,512
Yes.

995
00:49:38,622 --> 00:49:39,680
He cries?

996
00:49:40,157 --> 00:49:42,682
Cries in the sense, quite cutely.

997
00:49:48,532 --> 00:49:49,590
What do you say?

998
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:50,758
Should we all meet?

999
00:49:52,569 --> 00:49:55,367
Actually he's already asked me out.
- Really?

1000
00:49:56,774 --> 00:49:58,173
We studied in the same college.

1001
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:01,239
Anyway. Next Thursday.

1002
00:50:03,781 --> 00:50:04,839
Wow!

1003
00:50:05,349 --> 00:50:06,475
Great! I'll be matchmaker.

1004
00:50:08,652 --> 00:50:11,280
Your second story is
also very interesting.

1005
00:50:11,522 --> 00:50:13,820
It was wonderful.
- Great!

1006
00:50:14,124 --> 00:50:15,182
I was impressed.

1007
00:50:16,327 --> 00:50:17,851
Thank God, you liked it, you know.

1008
00:50:18,362 --> 00:50:19,829
You inspire me a lot.

1009
00:50:21,131 --> 00:50:22,189
It was just an opinion.

1010
00:50:22,733 --> 00:50:26,260
Just an opinion? Your
opinion means everything to me!

1011
00:50:29,373 --> 00:50:32,206
But that line in your
script was wonderful.

1012
00:50:32,276 --> 00:50:35,871
Which one! Life is not a
dream but a bad TV soap.

1013
00:50:36,146 --> 00:50:38,273
Shall we take a walk?
- Sorry?

1014
00:50:38,482 --> 00:50:39,676
I mean.

1015
00:50:42,152 --> 00:50:44,882
Okay. Okay!

1016
00:50:48,158 --> 00:50:51,286
You know, the way you have
handled the relationships...

1017
00:50:51,829 --> 00:50:52,887
Be careful.

1018
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:56,497
You've built up tension.
It's very effective!

1019
00:50:57,668 --> 00:50:58,726
And also the climax.

1020
00:51:00,704 --> 00:51:01,762
It's beautiful.

1021
00:51:02,306 --> 00:51:05,901
You know, writing is
very sophisticated.

1022
00:51:07,778 --> 00:51:09,177
For five days I was
searching for a word...

1023
00:51:09,246 --> 00:51:12,181
...which would describe
a husband completely.

1024
00:51:12,583 --> 00:51:13,709
I couldn't find anything.

1025
00:51:14,451 --> 00:51:15,918
And then it finally struck me.

1026
00:51:16,253 --> 00:51:17,311
Landoor!

1027
00:51:19,523 --> 00:51:22,185
Actually, I checked
in the dictionary...

1028
00:51:22,259 --> 00:51:26,525
...but didn't find the
word called, Landoor.

1029
00:51:26,597 --> 00:51:27,655
I made it up.

1030
00:51:28,332 --> 00:51:29,731
You made it up?
- Yes.

1031
00:51:32,603 --> 00:51:33,661
Landoor!

1032
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:37,498
You know...

1033
00:51:38,275 --> 00:51:42,939
...sometimes I think I
should own an island.

1034
00:51:43,847 --> 00:51:44,939
And a yacht.

1035
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:48,715
I would live in the
island for six months.

1036
00:51:49,219 --> 00:51:51,813
Imagine! Just imagine!

1037
00:51:52,289 --> 00:51:57,556
In the early morning sun, I
would be on the deck writing.

1038
00:51:58,695 --> 00:51:59,957
Sounds great!

1039
00:52:00,431 --> 00:52:04,891
And in the evening in the
middle of the ocean I would kiss.

1040
00:52:06,837 --> 00:52:08,236
If you haven't kissed in
the middle of the ocean...

1041
00:52:08,305 --> 00:52:09,966
...then you haven't really kissed.

1042
00:52:14,311 --> 00:52:17,974
What do you think? Do you think
physical attraction lasts long?

1043
00:52:18,916 --> 00:52:21,476
The last time I was with
someone we didn't go beyond a kiss.

1044
00:52:21,852 --> 00:52:24,320
You felt shy?
- No, not at all.

1045
00:52:25,255 --> 00:52:26,984
Then he wasn't romantic enough?

1046
00:52:27,324 --> 00:52:30,316
No. He was romantic.
- Okay. Then?

1047
00:52:30,861 --> 00:52:32,556
Sorry, I'm getting personal.

1048
00:52:32,729 --> 00:52:37,393
No. It's just that
we couldn't do it.

1049
00:52:38,936 --> 00:52:41,666
You couldn't kiss?
- No, not that!

1050
00:52:41,738 --> 00:52:42,796
Then?

1051
00:52:43,941 --> 00:52:45,772
I was scared.

1052
00:52:47,277 --> 00:52:48,744
A kiss is very intimate, you know.

1053
00:52:48,812 --> 00:52:51,747
You don't have to be scared.
- No! You don't understand.

1054
00:52:52,349 --> 00:52:54,283
'After that Raga said
something to Rishi...

1055
00:52:54,351 --> 00:52:56,683
...which really shocked him! '

1056
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:02,554
'Lt completely changed
his outlook towards her.'

1057
00:53:03,694 --> 00:53:06,561
'Weird questions filled his mind.'

1058
00:53:07,898 --> 00:53:11,356
'Like Samit, he too lost his
balance between body and mind.'

1059
00:53:12,503 --> 00:53:14,368
'But one thing was clear to him.'

1060
00:53:14,905 --> 00:53:16,600
'That size does matter.'

1061
00:53:28,986 --> 00:53:32,717
No, let it be. What are you doing?

1062
00:53:32,856 --> 00:53:33,914
No.

1063
00:53:37,761 --> 00:53:41,390
You know, I read a
survey in a men's magazine.

1064
00:53:42,399 --> 00:53:43,593
There were really
interesting questions.

1065
00:53:44,902 --> 00:53:47,598
The first question was,
'how good are you in bed? '

1066
00:53:48,872 --> 00:53:49,930
Really?

1067
00:53:50,407 --> 00:53:53,035
No, I mean, they asked men
how good they are in bed.

1068
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:59,412
So I thought who better
than you to ask how good I...

1069
00:54:00,551 --> 00:54:03,019
After so many years of marriage
you are thinking of all this?

1070
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:04,678
No.

1071
00:54:06,356 --> 00:54:07,414
There was one more question.

1072
00:54:08,692 --> 00:54:12,355
Have you ever made
your wife uncomfortable...

1073
00:54:12,429 --> 00:54:16,593
...because of your size?
- What?

1074
00:54:17,768 --> 00:54:22,364
Have I ever hurt you in
bed and you didn't tell me...

1075
00:54:22,439 --> 00:54:27,877
...then you can... If you have...

1076
00:54:28,979 --> 00:54:31,447
Are you all right?
- Yes.

1077
00:54:32,716 --> 00:54:34,115
I don't know you've
been acting really weird.

1078
00:54:34,785 --> 00:54:36,116
I don't know what
all do you think about.

1079
00:54:40,657 --> 00:54:44,388
Are you thinking of a divorce?
- Divorce? No. I just thinking...

1080
00:54:44,461 --> 00:54:47,897
...whether I satisfy you or not?

1081
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:50,862
Please, I would've told you.

1082
00:55:02,579 --> 00:55:04,672
Simi! Simi!

1083
00:55:06,483 --> 00:55:09,475
Can we... come on!

1084
00:55:11,622 --> 00:55:12,748
Are you mad?

1085
00:55:13,023 --> 00:55:14,991
I'm working. I have a
deadline to meet, Rishi.

1086
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:30,165
Yes?
- Hi!

1087
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:37,513
Hi!
- Hi! - Hi!

1088
00:55:39,049 --> 00:55:43,645
Oh, yes... - I...
- Come in! Come in!

1089
00:55:44,021 --> 00:55:47,457
No, are you sure, I can...
- No problem... tell me.

1090
00:55:48,725 --> 00:55:49,817
How did you come here?

1091
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:52,052
You had said Paramount Towers.

1092
00:55:52,129 --> 00:55:53,528
How did you get the flat number?

1093
00:55:53,797 --> 00:55:54,855
The guard told me.

1094
00:55:54,931 --> 00:55:56,193
How did the guard know?

1095
00:55:56,667 --> 00:55:58,965
He said you get a lot
of medical supplies.

1096
00:55:59,036 --> 00:56:02,164
Is everything okay? I mean...
- Yes, we get some medical stuff.

1097
00:56:03,907 --> 00:56:04,965
Come. Sit.

1098
00:56:07,044 --> 00:56:09,205
You're living like a bachelor.

1099
00:56:09,479 --> 00:56:10,537
I am...

1100
00:56:12,883 --> 00:56:14,544
What do you have?

1101
00:56:15,485 --> 00:56:18,545
It's just an adventure. I
had gone shopping to Bangalore.

1102
00:56:18,622 --> 00:56:19,714
Bangalore or Bangkok?

1103
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:22,554
Just understand. It's a lot of fun.

1104
00:56:22,726 --> 00:56:28,722
Shut up! - Pochkoo! Are
you ready? - No! Please!

1105
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:29,857
Pochkoo?

1106
00:56:30,767 --> 00:56:31,859
That's my name these days.

1107
00:56:31,935 --> 00:56:34,096
Pochkoo, sweety candy,
sweety Bopara.

1108
00:56:34,171 --> 00:56:35,570
Those are my names.

1109
00:56:35,639 --> 00:56:37,630
Sweety Bopara?
- Yes, very imaginative.

1110
00:56:37,708 --> 00:56:40,142
Pochkoo!
- I'm coming. Just wait!

1111
00:56:40,711 --> 00:56:42,201
Pochkoo!

1112
00:56:56,059 --> 00:56:57,117
Condom!

1113
00:56:59,196 --> 00:57:00,254
540 rupees!

1114
00:57:06,069 --> 00:57:07,127
Sir, money?

1115
00:57:07,204 --> 00:57:09,866
Give you later. I'd ordered it since
morning. You got it so late. - Sir.

1116
00:57:11,608 --> 00:57:12,734
Come!

1117
00:57:14,044 --> 00:57:15,102
Tell me something.

1118
00:57:15,746 --> 00:57:16,838
We are of the same age.

1119
00:57:16,913 --> 00:57:18,938
So are you taking Viagra or what?

1120
00:57:19,149 --> 00:57:21,174
No Viagra! Never!

1121
00:57:21,551 --> 00:57:24,748
You have to discover the
stream of energy from within.

1122
00:57:26,089 --> 00:57:28,557
Look, we are of the same age...

1123
00:57:28,625 --> 00:57:30,889
...who would say we
are of the same age?

1124
00:57:31,161 --> 00:57:32,856
Look at yourself
and then look at me.

1125
00:57:32,929 --> 00:57:33,987
I look so youthful.

1126
00:57:34,064 --> 00:57:35,759
And you're looking like an uncle.

1127
00:57:35,832 --> 00:57:37,561
I looked like you
when I was with Mita.

1128
00:57:37,634 --> 00:57:39,625
Uncle? Yes, I'm... Look! Look at me!

1129
00:57:40,170 --> 00:57:42,104
And variety is the mantra!

1130
00:57:42,172 --> 00:57:43,969
Boss, variety!

1131
00:57:44,775 --> 00:57:46,640
Sweety, where is my sports-bra?

1132
00:57:47,577 --> 00:57:48,703
Must be with the doll!

1133
00:57:49,112 --> 00:57:50,170
Doll?
- Got it from Bangkok.

1134
00:57:50,247 --> 00:57:51,578
Are you wearing it?

1135
00:57:51,648 --> 00:57:52,706
No, I...

1136
00:57:53,917 --> 00:57:54,975
Yes!

1137
00:57:55,051 --> 00:57:57,645
It slipped to the back.
It's quite slippery.

1138
00:57:58,588 --> 00:57:59,646
Yes! I'm getting it.

1139
00:58:00,023 --> 00:58:01,752
Variety is the spice of life.

1140
00:58:01,925 --> 00:58:05,759
Sweety! Sweety Bopara!

1141
00:58:06,196 --> 00:58:07,254
Coming!

1142
00:58:11,101 --> 00:58:12,261
Sweety Bopara!

1143
00:58:16,173 --> 00:58:17,231
'Excuse me! '

1144
00:58:17,307 --> 00:58:20,936
'Do you think variety is the
spice of life? Like Samit said.'

1145
00:58:21,011 --> 00:58:22,069
Rubbish!

1146
00:58:22,145 --> 00:58:23,874
What has he become? Pochkoo!

1147
00:58:23,947 --> 00:58:25,346
I mean he's completely lost it.

1148
00:58:26,216 --> 00:58:29,151
Kaya is like my student.
She's young and attractive.

1149
00:58:29,219 --> 00:58:31,619
But that doesn't mean
you'll have an affair...

1150
00:58:31,688 --> 00:58:33,679
...with every young and attractive
girl! That you'll chase her!

1151
00:58:33,757 --> 00:58:35,691
You should have some control,
for God's sake!

1152
00:58:35,759 --> 00:58:36,885
He has completely lost it!

1153
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:39,019
'But Raga! Raga? '

1154
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:43,622
'You too like Raga.'
- What do you mean?

1155
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:45,065
'You too complement her.'

1156
00:58:45,902 --> 00:58:46,960
'Don't you like her? '

1157
00:58:47,637 --> 00:58:49,366
'Come on, it can be seen! '

1158
00:58:49,639 --> 00:58:50,697
'You like Raga! '

1159
00:58:52,676 --> 00:58:54,007
'Hello! Don't you? '

1160
00:58:54,644 --> 00:58:55,702
'You love Raga! '

1161
00:59:06,556 --> 00:59:08,524
Hi Veer!
- Hi Simi!

1162
00:59:08,591 --> 00:59:11,151
I've got soup for you.
- Thanks.

1163
00:59:11,227 --> 00:59:12,285
You're a sweetheart.

1164
00:59:12,962 --> 00:59:14,691
You were quite busy, so I thought.

1165
00:59:16,633 --> 00:59:18,123
It's hot. Should I
keep it over there?

1166
00:59:18,201 --> 00:59:19,259
Yes, sure.

1167
00:59:23,239 --> 00:59:25,605
Are you going to a concert?

1168
00:59:25,675 --> 00:59:27,165
Indian Music.

1169
00:59:27,644 --> 00:59:28,702
Wow!

1170
00:59:29,312 --> 00:59:31,337
I just hope Mita
likes that kind of music.

1171
00:59:31,414 --> 00:59:32,472
I'm sure she will.

1172
00:59:32,549 --> 00:59:33,982
Okay, tell me what you think, Simi.

1173
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:35,979
After the concert, I've
planned to take her to...

1174
00:59:36,052 --> 00:59:37,178
...Royal Darbar for dinner.

1175
00:59:38,321 --> 00:59:40,289
That's beautiful!
- Yes!

1176
00:59:41,324 --> 00:59:43,588
I like all those
chandeliers and candlelit tables.

1177
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:44,718
It's very intimate.

1178
00:59:44,994 --> 00:59:46,052
Very romantic.

1179
00:59:46,596 --> 00:59:47,995
It feels kind of
strange to date someone...

1180
00:59:48,064 --> 00:59:49,725
...who is recently separated.

1181
00:59:50,133 --> 00:59:51,191
That's true.

1182
00:59:52,035 --> 00:59:53,593
I'm very old fashioned.

1183
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:57,265
Candlelight dinners and
ghazals (songs). I like all that.

1184
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:58,398
Me too!

1185
00:59:59,008 --> 01:00:01,238
Renu used to say I
should've been born in the 50's.

1186
01:00:02,011 --> 01:00:03,137
She thought it was very mushy.

1187
01:00:03,346 --> 01:00:05,644
No! I think it's so sweet!

1188
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:10,213
You too like all this, don't you?
- Very much. - I know.

1189
01:00:17,093 --> 01:00:19,027
Do you still find me attractive?

1190
01:00:20,463 --> 01:00:22,624
Simi! Of course!

1191
01:00:23,633 --> 01:00:24,691
Really?

1192
01:00:26,102 --> 01:00:27,160
I said it.

1193
01:00:28,371 --> 01:00:30,339
But these days we don't do anything.

1194
01:00:32,108 --> 01:00:34,508
Because we have different schedules.

1195
01:00:36,312 --> 01:00:39,304
But earlier when we wanted
we used to find the time.

1196
01:00:40,116 --> 01:00:44,052
Simi, when we used to do it
anywhere, you used to be scared...

1197
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:47,089
...that someone would come or
someone would see and all that.

1198
01:00:48,057 --> 01:00:49,649
Now you feel it's romantic.

1199
01:00:51,494 --> 01:00:52,552
Let's get some sleep.

1200
01:00:53,062 --> 01:00:54,120
Goodnight.

1201
01:00:56,132 --> 01:00:58,225
Do you find other girls attractive?

1202
01:00:58,401 --> 01:01:03,134
I told you, right? No?
- Why? Your college students?

1203
01:01:03,206 --> 01:01:04,571
All of them must be crazy about you.

1204
01:01:04,641 --> 01:01:06,108
No, there's nothing like this.

1205
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:07,540
Everyone knows I'm married.

1206
01:01:45,181 --> 01:01:50,175
Life is a journey. We are travelers.

1207
01:01:50,587 --> 01:01:56,287
Life is a journey. We are travelers.

1208
01:01:56,359 --> 01:02:01,296
We have a companion but our
destinations are different.

1209
01:02:02,198 --> 01:02:07,659
We have a companion but our
destinations are different.

1210
01:02:07,737 --> 01:02:13,198
Life is a journey. We are travelers.

1211
01:02:13,343 --> 01:02:18,872
Life is a journey. We are travelers.

1212
01:02:19,148 --> 01:02:23,881
We have a companion but our
destinations are different.

1213
01:02:24,654 --> 01:02:30,684
We have a companion but our
destinations are different.

1214
01:03:05,228 --> 01:03:13,658
There is a desire to unite.

1215
01:03:13,803 --> 01:03:21,232
Distance is the hurdle.

1216
01:03:22,278 --> 01:03:27,773
There is a desire to unite.

1217
01:03:27,850 --> 01:03:33,618
Distance is the hurdle.

1218
01:03:33,690 --> 01:03:38,821
We're one.

1219
01:03:39,295 --> 01:03:43,891
But we're not the same.

1220
01:03:43,966 --> 01:03:46,594
Some love each other.

1221
01:03:46,669 --> 01:03:48,899
Some are angry.

1222
01:03:49,572 --> 01:03:52,268
Some love each other.

1223
01:03:52,341 --> 01:03:55,242
Some are angry.

1224
01:03:55,311 --> 01:04:00,305
We have a companion but our
destinations are different.

1225
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:06,382
We have a companion but our
destinations are different.

1226
01:04:06,456 --> 01:04:11,758
Life is a journey.
We are travellers.

1227
01:04:12,261 --> 01:04:17,597
Life is a journey.
We are travellers.

1228
01:04:17,667 --> 01:04:22,604
We have a companion but our
destinations are different.

1229
01:04:23,339 --> 01:04:29,471
We have a companion but our
destinations are different.

1230
01:04:36,619 --> 01:04:37,677
It was great, wasn't it?

1231
01:04:38,354 --> 01:04:39,412
It was good.

1232
01:04:39,689 --> 01:04:40,951
The music was very good.

1233
01:04:41,891 --> 01:04:42,983
Music was good.

1234
01:04:44,861 --> 01:04:47,352
But the seats were very
uncomfortable. Don't you think?

1235
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:48,488
Oh sorry!

1236
01:04:49,799 --> 01:04:52,359
I'm already getting a cold.
- Sorry.

1237
01:04:56,873 --> 01:04:57,999
Food was good.

1238
01:04:58,374 --> 01:04:59,568
Oh, I am glad you liked something.

1239
01:05:00,576 --> 01:05:02,373
But the cook doesn't know how to
prepare Biryani (flavoured rice).

1240
01:05:03,746 --> 01:05:05,373
I prepare better biryani at home.

1241
01:05:17,393 --> 01:05:18,451
Are you coming?

1242
01:05:18,528 --> 01:05:19,586
Will that be okay?

1243
01:05:20,463 --> 01:05:23,330
Sure! Coffee!
- Sure!

1244
01:05:23,399 --> 01:05:24,457
I'd love to.

1245
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:32,066
Nice place Mita!

1246
01:05:32,942 --> 01:05:34,000
I don't like it.

1247
01:05:34,076 --> 01:05:35,771
The decorator messed it up.

1248
01:05:36,546 --> 01:05:37,604
Anyway.

1249
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:38,942
I'm looking for a
smaller place, you know.

1250
01:05:39,015 --> 01:05:40,073
Maybe in Lokhandwala.

1251
01:05:41,017 --> 01:05:42,075
Isn't it funny?

1252
01:05:42,351 --> 01:05:44,478
You never know how life changes.

1253
01:05:45,955 --> 01:05:47,923
Want to get married again?

1254
01:05:48,825 --> 01:05:49,883
God, no!

1255
01:05:49,959 --> 01:05:51,358
I love being single.

1256
01:05:52,929 --> 01:05:54,726
Some are happy being married.

1257
01:05:55,364 --> 01:05:56,422
Not me.

1258
01:05:57,700 --> 01:05:59,429
I think I should.

1259
01:05:59,936 --> 01:06:01,767
Really? Why didn't you?

1260
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:05,837
I don't know. I almost got
married but it didn't happen.

1261
01:06:07,810 --> 01:06:09,004
Coffee!
- Thanks.

1262
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:13,414
I want to be single for a while.

1263
01:06:13,950 --> 01:06:15,110
I want to meet new friends.

1264
01:06:16,385 --> 01:06:17,443
If I find them then it's great.

1265
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:19,454
Otherwise, I'm fine.

1266
01:06:20,590 --> 01:06:22,990
You'll get you want,
Mita. You're beautiful.

1267
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:25,118
Wait! Wait!

1268
01:06:25,995 --> 01:06:27,121
I'm not ready. Okay?

1269
01:06:41,811 --> 01:06:42,869
I'm sorry.

1270
01:06:43,479 --> 01:06:44,946
It takes me a little time.

1271
01:06:45,414 --> 01:06:46,472
I understand.

1272
01:06:47,950 --> 01:06:49,417
I haven't met anyone
since a long time...

1273
01:06:49,485 --> 01:06:51,453
...with whom I feel comfortable.

1274
01:06:53,089 --> 01:06:54,488
Do you like my company at least?

1275
01:06:56,025 --> 01:06:58,789
If I didn't, I wouldn't meet you.

1276
01:07:00,096 --> 01:07:01,154
Thanks.

1277
01:07:02,732 --> 01:07:03,994
Nice coffee.

1278
01:07:05,434 --> 01:07:06,492
Thanks.

1279
01:07:07,570 --> 01:07:10,596
I really had a
wonderful time with you.

1280
01:07:11,641 --> 01:07:12,699
I did too.

1281
01:07:16,045 --> 01:07:18,843
Veer! Please!

1282
01:07:26,989 --> 01:07:29,184
I'm sorry, Mita. It's
just that I really like you.

1283
01:07:31,661 --> 01:07:32,719
It's my mistake.

1284
01:07:33,963 --> 01:07:37,660
Actually, my marriage
has been dead for so long.

1285
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:44,539
Anyway, everything has
to end someday. Right?

1286
01:07:45,875 --> 01:07:47,206
But you never know when.

1287
01:07:50,646 --> 01:07:51,704
I found out.

1288
01:07:53,716 --> 01:07:54,774
That's what's killing me.

1289
01:07:56,819 --> 01:08:00,721
'I had gone out shopping and
Samit had gone to Bangalore.'

1290
01:08:01,891 --> 01:08:04,121
'But suddenly, just by accident... '

1291
01:08:23,846 --> 01:08:25,837
Look at these. These
are the right size.

1292
01:08:26,949 --> 01:08:28,576
Yes. That's good.

1293
01:08:29,118 --> 01:08:30,585
Yes, but what's the size?

1294
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:32,578
32 B.

1295
01:08:32,855 --> 01:08:34,755
What is 32 B?

1296
01:08:35,658 --> 01:08:37,023
Driver, take me home!

1297
01:08:39,862 --> 01:08:41,022
I just told you.

1298
01:08:41,097 --> 01:08:42,928
32 B is 32 B!

1299
01:08:43,699 --> 01:08:44,757
No, you don't understand.

1300
01:08:44,834 --> 01:08:47,530
Actually, I have a visual
memory about how they are...

1301
01:08:47,603 --> 01:08:50,868
...but I don't know how much is 32 B?

1302
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:55,008
I mean, a little smaller than yours.

1303
01:08:58,114 --> 01:08:59,979
He's running with
the bra! Catch him!

1304
01:09:00,049 --> 01:09:02,745
How can he do this? - Move!

1305
01:09:07,823 --> 01:09:08,881
Mita!

1306
01:09:12,628 --> 01:09:13,686
Mita!

1307
01:09:18,567 --> 01:09:19,625
You are having food?

1308
01:09:20,836 --> 01:09:21,894
How was Bangalore?

1309
01:09:22,805 --> 01:09:24,705
Very tiring.

1310
01:09:26,175 --> 01:09:28,575
My boss kept me
really busy. - Really?

1311
01:09:29,145 --> 01:09:30,203
Yes.

1312
01:09:38,587 --> 01:09:39,645
I'll take a shower.

1313
01:09:46,762 --> 01:09:48,662
'I was angry. And I was hurt.'

1314
01:09:49,265 --> 01:09:50,596
I waited for many days.

1315
01:09:51,167 --> 01:09:52,225
Thought he'd tell me everything.

1316
01:09:53,669 --> 01:09:54,727
He never told me anything.

1317
01:09:59,642 --> 01:10:01,610
After getting so suspicious,
I never found an incident...

1318
01:10:01,677 --> 01:10:04,009
...which would increase my suspicion.

1319
01:10:05,214 --> 01:10:06,340
I decided to forget it.

1320
01:10:07,149 --> 01:10:08,207
Everything will be fine.

1321
01:10:10,186 --> 01:10:11,346
But I couldn't.

1322
01:10:12,955 --> 01:10:16,686
Because I started thinking
about removing him from my life.

1323
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:19,689
There were too many
tensions between us.

1324
01:10:20,062 --> 01:10:21,359
We had big fights.

1325
01:10:23,966 --> 01:10:25,024
And now I'm single.

1326
01:10:25,835 --> 01:10:29,703
One of those, who
should get married.

1327
01:10:47,656 --> 01:10:48,714
Raga!

1328
01:10:50,226 --> 01:10:51,284
Hi!

1329
01:10:51,727 --> 01:10:52,785
Hi!

1330
01:10:52,862 --> 01:10:53,954
I'll just see you guys. - Bye.

1331
01:10:56,799 --> 01:10:57,993
Where are you going?

1332
01:10:58,067 --> 01:10:59,398
I was going home.

1333
01:11:00,269 --> 01:11:02,737
Okay, I'll drop you.

1334
01:11:02,805 --> 01:11:04,033
I live quite far away.

1335
01:11:05,674 --> 01:11:06,732
No problem, come.

1336
01:11:06,809 --> 01:11:07,867
Are you sure?
- Sure!

1337
01:11:13,682 --> 01:11:15,673
Come, meet my parents.
They'd love to meet you.

1338
01:11:15,751 --> 01:11:17,685
Just come and see how I live.
- Okay.

1339
01:11:29,698 --> 01:11:31,757
Raga! Raga! Raga!

1340
01:11:31,834 --> 01:11:32,960
What are you doing here?

1341
01:11:36,038 --> 01:11:37,198
For him!

1342
01:11:38,274 --> 01:11:39,434
You're not meeting me for him?

1343
01:11:39,708 --> 01:11:41,005
What do you mean?
- What?

1344
01:11:41,877 --> 01:11:42,969
You've been mistaken.

1345
01:11:43,045 --> 01:11:45,843
No, I wanted to meet him. I
wanted too see how he looks.

1346
01:11:46,248 --> 01:11:47,772
But I'm not impressed. Not at all!

1347
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:49,283
This is not my boyfriend.
- Impressed?

1348
01:11:49,351 --> 01:11:50,409
He's my professor!

1349
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:52,277
Boyfriend?
- Your professor?

1350
01:11:52,354 --> 01:11:53,446
Yes.
- Really?

1351
01:11:54,056 --> 01:11:55,785
Yes sir, I'm professor Rishi Sharma.

1352
01:11:55,858 --> 01:11:57,883
Nice to meet you, professor!

1353
01:11:58,294 --> 01:11:59,454
That's enough, Chirag!

1354
01:11:59,528 --> 01:12:01,291
Tell me something, professor.

1355
01:12:01,797 --> 01:12:04,095
Do you seduce all your students?

1356
01:12:04,166 --> 01:12:06,726
Do you have a choice? I mean...
- What did you say?

1357
01:12:06,802 --> 01:12:07,860
Chirag, come on! Enough!

1358
01:12:07,937 --> 01:12:10,337
I'm sure he doesn't scare you.
- Scare you? I don't understand!

1359
01:12:10,406 --> 01:12:11,464
Chirag, what are you doing here?

1360
01:12:11,807 --> 01:12:15,334
Please! Please give me
one more chance. Please.

1361
01:12:15,411 --> 01:12:18,812
Chirag, stop behaving
like a teenager. Okay?

1362
01:12:18,881 --> 01:12:19,939
I'm sorry.

1363
01:12:20,015 --> 01:12:23,348
Then what do I do? Have you ever
thought what will happen to me?

1364
01:12:23,419 --> 01:12:25,944
Have you ever thought?
- I just cant, okay?

1365
01:12:26,355 --> 01:12:29,813
I'll be gentle... - No... I can't.

1366
01:12:30,092 --> 01:12:31,491
Brother, make her understand.

1367
01:12:31,827 --> 01:12:34,819
What's my fault?
- Are you okay?

1368
01:12:34,897 --> 01:12:36,125
I can't breathe.

1369
01:12:36,198 --> 01:12:37,256
Please go!

1370
01:12:37,333 --> 01:12:40,131
It's a big no! Okay?
- We'll manage it!

1371
01:12:40,202 --> 01:12:41,794
Please give me a chance! Rags!

1372
01:12:41,870 --> 01:12:43,235
I'm sorry. I just cant breath.

1373
01:12:43,839 --> 01:12:45,136
Raga, who was that?

1374
01:12:46,108 --> 01:12:49,305
If you want to know then
I'll tell you little by little.

1375
01:12:49,378 --> 01:12:50,436
It's a long story.
- Yes. Please.

1376
01:12:52,181 --> 01:12:57,517
Ok. Before joining this course,
I used to get bored at home.

1377
01:12:57,853 --> 01:13:01,118
Dad asked me to join
his office, as a trainee.

1378
01:13:01,991 --> 01:13:03,788
I met another trainee over there.

1379
01:13:04,126 --> 01:13:05,252
His name was Raghu.

1380
01:13:06,328 --> 01:13:08,193
He was recently divorced.

1381
01:13:08,397 --> 01:13:12,857
This Raghu is your dad's colleague?
- No! This is not Raghu.

1382
01:13:12,935 --> 01:13:14,800
This leads to him. I'm
telling you from the start.

1383
01:13:14,870 --> 01:13:16,235
Raghu used to come home.

1384
01:13:16,872 --> 01:13:18,362
Then one day he
tells me he loves me.

1385
01:13:19,074 --> 01:13:20,132
I was very flattered.

1386
01:13:20,409 --> 01:13:22,809
Around the same time, I
met Raghu's brother Rajiv...

1387
01:13:22,878 --> 01:13:25,312
...and sister-in-law, Suzanne.

1388
01:13:25,381 --> 01:13:27,542
We used to talk a lot.

1389
01:13:28,317 --> 01:13:31,184
Then one day Rajiv tells me
he has a crush on me as well.

1390
01:13:32,021 --> 01:13:37,425
So this is Raghu's brother, Rajiv.
- No! This is not Rajiv.

1391
01:13:37,493 --> 01:13:38,551
This leads up to him.

1392
01:13:38,894 --> 01:13:40,987
But pretty soon I was
seeing both of them.

1393
01:13:42,097 --> 01:13:46,056
But instead of being happy my
feelings were very mixed up.

1394
01:13:46,402 --> 01:13:48,370
I was miserable. I
had these dark circles.

1395
01:13:48,837 --> 01:13:50,532
My neighbour, Chirag.
He saw me like that.

1396
01:13:51,106 --> 01:13:52,573
He asked me out for coffee.

1397
01:13:53,042 --> 01:13:54,100
I thought why not.

1398
01:13:54,176 --> 01:13:56,201
I was very impressed
with his lifestyle.

1399
01:13:56,845 --> 01:13:57,971
Bachelor at 40.

1400
01:13:58,047 --> 01:13:59,571
He also gave me a
shoulder in tough times.

1401
01:13:59,882 --> 01:14:04,444
One day he told he doesn't want
to hear about Raghu and Rajiv.

1402
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:06,010
Because he had fallen for me.

1403
01:14:07,423 --> 01:14:10,051
He is the one I told you,
the one who has a problem.

1404
01:14:10,192 --> 01:14:15,220
So he's the one who has...
- Yes.

1405
01:14:16,098 --> 01:14:18,999
He's a nice guy. But then
I met Zaheer at the gym.

1406
01:14:19,201 --> 01:14:21,294
He was of my age.
- No! No! Raga!

1407
01:14:21,403 --> 01:14:22,461
Thank you!

1408
01:14:22,538 --> 01:14:23,596
No!
- That's enough!

1409
01:14:23,672 --> 01:14:26,266
He was very sweet! And he liked me.

1410
01:14:26,342 --> 01:14:29,402
Then I realised what am I
doing with these oldies?

1411
01:14:29,478 --> 01:14:32,072
Then I straightened up.
And I am dating Zaheer.

1412
01:14:33,115 --> 01:14:35,879
God! You have so much material...

1413
01:14:35,951 --> 01:14:38,886
...you can make a debut
feature film and also a sequel.

1414
01:14:39,888 --> 01:14:42,322
No, you can also make
a soap of 100 episodes.

1415
01:14:42,391 --> 01:14:44,120
Don't you think I am
doing the right thing?

1416
01:14:44,193 --> 01:14:46,184
I mean I like being with Zaheer.

1417
01:14:46,261 --> 01:14:48,889
But I started feeling I was an
unfulfilled fantasy or dream...

1418
01:14:48,964 --> 01:14:51,626
...of every 30 plus guy, right?

1419
01:14:55,104 --> 01:14:57,095
You are always right.
- Mom! - But you never want to...

1420
01:14:57,172 --> 01:14:58,230
Raga has come!

1421
01:14:58,307 --> 01:15:00,138
This is professor Rishi Sharma.
- Hello!

1422
01:15:00,209 --> 01:15:01,267
Very glad to meet you.

1423
01:15:01,343 --> 01:15:02,401
And dad. Sir.

1424
01:15:02,478 --> 01:15:04,378
It's an honour, sir.
Can I get you something?

1425
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:06,038
No, thank you.

1426
01:15:06,248 --> 01:15:09,149
Actually if you have a pill
for headache then please...

1427
01:15:10,185 --> 01:15:12,119
Raga's birthday is
coming up in a few days.

1428
01:15:12,588 --> 01:15:13,646
We'd like you to come.

1429
01:15:13,922 --> 01:15:15,048
Dad, he doesn't want to come.

1430
01:15:15,124 --> 01:15:18,287
We would like it if
you come with your wife.

1431
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:20,260
Mom, he doesn't want
to come on my birthday.

1432
01:15:21,330 --> 01:15:22,661
You have a nice influence on her.

1433
01:15:23,098 --> 01:15:24,292
She's very impressed by you.

1434
01:15:25,367 --> 01:15:27,995
She's is a wonderful girl.

1435
01:15:28,537 --> 01:15:30,664
It would be an
honour for us if you come.

1436
01:15:30,939 --> 01:15:32,270
Dad, he won't come.

1437
01:15:40,682 --> 01:15:41,944
Simi!

1438
01:15:42,618 --> 01:15:43,949
Finally, I've read your poems.

1439
01:15:44,019 --> 01:15:45,543
Oh, really?
- Yes.

1440
01:15:45,954 --> 01:15:49,287
Thanks! Tell me honestly,
did you like them?

1441
01:15:49,358 --> 01:15:51,952
You write well.
- Really?

1442
01:15:52,961 --> 01:15:55,361
I just can't believe it.
It's just a hobby of mine.

1443
01:15:55,431 --> 01:15:56,955
No, they are full of feelings.
- Yes?

1444
01:15:57,032 --> 01:15:58,090
What does your husband say?

1445
01:15:58,634 --> 01:16:00,295
I can't show them to my husband.

1446
01:16:00,369 --> 01:16:02,234
He's very critical
about my writing. - Yes?

1447
01:16:02,571 --> 01:16:06,029
Obviously, I don't
write seriously. You know.

1448
01:16:06,108 --> 01:16:07,700
But I'm so happy you read it.

1449
01:16:09,378 --> 01:16:10,436
Great!

1450
01:16:10,512 --> 01:16:11,706
The one you've written on Almora.

1451
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:15,438
There is a river there. I'd
love to live there, you know.

1452
01:16:15,517 --> 01:16:17,985
If fact I have
thought that after death...

1453
01:16:18,053 --> 01:16:20,112
...my ashes should be
immersed in that river.

1454
01:16:20,189 --> 01:16:21,247
Really?

1455
01:16:21,323 --> 01:16:22,381
Yes.

1456
01:16:22,458 --> 01:16:25,985
In fact I used to tell
Renu about that river. - What?

1457
01:16:26,061 --> 01:16:28,120
Really?
- I like that place very much.

1458
01:16:29,264 --> 01:16:30,390
I can't believe it.

1459
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:32,458
Wow!

1460
01:16:33,001 --> 01:16:34,059
Shall we go out for lunch?

1461
01:16:36,472 --> 01:16:37,598
Yes, let's go.
- Come on.

1462
01:17:24,786 --> 01:17:26,253
Back to work?
- Yes.

1463
01:17:27,055 --> 01:17:28,113
Simi!

1464
01:17:29,057 --> 01:17:30,718
Can I tell you something honestly?

1465
01:17:30,792 --> 01:17:32,054
Yes, of course.

1466
01:17:33,595 --> 01:17:35,654
I wanted to thank you
for introducing me to Mita.

1467
01:17:37,065 --> 01:17:38,191
I think I'm in love with her.

1468
01:17:41,069 --> 01:17:42,263
So soon?

1469
01:17:43,205 --> 01:17:44,604
But I don't think she's interested.

1470
01:17:45,407 --> 01:17:47,739
Well she has just separated so...

1471
01:17:47,809 --> 01:17:51,074
But the problem with me is that
when I love someone I can't wait.

1472
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:52,474
You have to give it some time.

1473
01:17:53,682 --> 01:17:55,479
Is she really as nice as she looks?

1474
01:17:55,551 --> 01:17:56,609
Mita?
- Yes.

1475
01:17:56,685 --> 01:17:58,084
Yes, she's very nice.

1476
01:17:59,288 --> 01:18:01,688
She's honest, you know.

1477
01:18:01,757 --> 01:18:03,156
And decent.

1478
01:18:04,092 --> 01:18:06,356
So, I don't have
words to praise her.

1479
01:18:06,828 --> 01:18:09,763
Simi, thank you. Thank you so much.

1480
01:18:09,831 --> 01:18:11,822
Your opinion is
very important for me.

1481
01:18:13,101 --> 01:18:14,159
You know.

1482
01:18:15,304 --> 01:18:17,636
I'm not feeling well. I just...

1483
01:18:17,706 --> 01:18:20,231
What happened?
- I don't know, maybe the food...

1484
01:18:20,442 --> 01:18:22,171
I'll just... I'm going to
go to the toilet. - Can I...

1485
01:18:22,244 --> 01:18:23,643
No, I'm fine.

1486
01:18:32,321 --> 01:18:34,380
I don't know why I introduced them.

1487
01:18:37,125 --> 01:18:38,717
When I obviously like him.

1488
01:18:39,861 --> 01:18:41,192
Maybe I was confused.

1489
01:18:42,197 --> 01:18:44,131
I didn't know what I wanted.

1490
01:18:48,403 --> 01:18:49,597
Ladies and gentlemen.

1491
01:18:50,138 --> 01:18:51,332
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

1492
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:53,198
We're here at the party now.

1493
01:18:53,542 --> 01:18:56,136
And we'd be doing some bad things.

1494
01:19:05,420 --> 01:19:07,354
Can you feel it in your body now?

1495
01:19:07,489 --> 01:19:09,616
Can you feel it in your body now?

1496
01:19:09,691 --> 01:19:11,750
Can you feel it in your body now?

1497
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:13,354
Can you feel it in your body now?

1498
01:19:14,162 --> 01:19:17,825
My darling stuns
you with her glance.

1499
01:19:18,233 --> 01:19:22,169
My darling stuns
you with her glance.

1500
01:19:22,237 --> 01:19:26,640
My darling stuns
you with her glance.

1501
01:19:27,175 --> 01:19:31,168
My darling stuns
you with her glance.

1502
01:19:31,847 --> 01:19:33,439
There is intoxication.

1503
01:19:34,182 --> 01:19:35,581
There is excitement.

1504
01:19:36,184 --> 01:19:38,175
In this chaos.

1505
01:19:38,453 --> 01:19:39,920
You don't know where you are.
- Hello!

1506
01:19:40,188 --> 01:19:41,519
Hello.
- I'm so glad you could come.

1507
01:19:41,590 --> 01:19:42,921
Thank you. Thank you.

1508
01:19:43,191 --> 01:19:45,853
I'll get you a drink.
Raga is somewhere here.

1509
01:19:45,927 --> 01:19:48,191
Excuse me. Enjoy!

1510
01:19:49,598 --> 01:19:51,190
There is intoxication.

1511
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:53,461
There is excitement.

1512
01:19:54,202 --> 01:19:56,193
In this chaos.

1513
01:19:56,271 --> 01:19:58,398
You don't know where you are.

1514
01:19:58,473 --> 01:20:02,341
My darling stuns with her glance.

1515
01:20:02,744 --> 01:20:06,805
My darling stuns with her glance.

1516
01:20:16,291 --> 01:20:20,751
Drown in those intense eyes now.

1517
01:20:20,829 --> 01:20:24,822
And never surface again here.

1518
01:20:25,367 --> 01:20:29,633
Intoxicated and in beloveds arms.

1519
01:20:29,705 --> 01:20:33,835
Everyone is lost here.

1520
01:20:34,242 --> 01:20:38,508
I just want to have fun.

1521
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:40,241
There is intoxication.

1522
01:20:40,849 --> 01:20:42,510
There is excitement.

1523
01:20:42,918 --> 01:20:44,783
In this chaos.

1524
01:20:45,253 --> 01:20:46,311
You don't know where you are.

1525
01:20:46,388 --> 01:20:47,446
Hi!
- Hi!

1526
01:20:47,522 --> 01:20:49,649
I'm so glad you're here.
- Thanks.

1527
01:20:49,725 --> 01:20:50,783
You look different.

1528
01:20:51,393 --> 01:20:54,260
Nicer! My younger!

1529
01:20:54,529 --> 01:20:55,587
Thanks.

1530
01:20:56,598 --> 01:20:58,930
Come on! Not now!

1531
01:21:00,936 --> 01:21:01,994
Raga!

1532
01:21:02,537 --> 01:21:03,936
I had a torch.

1533
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:06,537
What luck on my birthday?

1534
01:21:07,409 --> 01:21:11,675
By the way, you look very
nice in candlelight. - Thanks.

1535
01:21:12,347 --> 01:21:14,338
Did you see that lightning?

1536
01:21:15,016 --> 01:21:16,540
It's pouring nonstop.

1537
01:21:17,285 --> 01:21:18,877
How will people go home?

1538
01:21:19,287 --> 01:21:22,347
Raga, happy birthday.

1539
01:21:22,758 --> 01:21:23,816
Wow!

1540
01:21:25,761 --> 01:21:28,286
I didn't want to give it outside
because there're many people...

1541
01:21:28,363 --> 01:21:30,558
...and they would misunderstand.

1542
01:21:33,301 --> 01:21:34,359
It's lovely!

1543
01:21:35,036 --> 01:21:36,298
Thanks.

1544
01:21:36,505 --> 01:21:37,563
It's beautiful.

1545
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:40,507
But do you know what I really want?

1546
01:21:42,310 --> 01:21:43,368
What?

1547
01:21:43,578 --> 01:21:44,977
A birthday kiss would be nice.

1548
01:21:48,717 --> 01:21:49,979
Birthday kiss?

1549
01:22:02,330 --> 01:22:03,388
That's all?

1550
01:22:04,533 --> 01:22:07,934
That's all? It was a birthday kiss.

1551
01:22:08,804 --> 01:22:10,601
Well, you know what I want.

1552
01:22:13,475 --> 01:22:14,942
Your boyfriend is outside.

1553
01:22:16,077 --> 01:22:18,409
I know. It's not serious.

1554
01:22:18,947 --> 01:22:23,077
It's not serious? I can't
even think about it. I mean...

1555
01:22:24,419 --> 01:22:27,946
Okay, I have thought about it.
I mean, a thousand times but...

1556
01:22:29,558 --> 01:22:31,355
This is crazy! This is crazy!

1557
01:22:31,693 --> 01:22:33,888
Yes, actually it's disappointing.

1558
01:22:35,096 --> 01:22:37,963
Disappointing? Raga,
your boyfriend is outside.

1559
01:22:38,033 --> 01:22:42,902
Come on! It's raining so heavily.
It's my 21 birthday.

1560
01:22:43,371 --> 01:22:45,430
Don't you want to do
something wild for a change?

1561
01:22:46,374 --> 01:22:47,841
Even if it is stupid.

1562
01:22:49,377 --> 01:22:52,369
I'm sorry. I think I'm drunk.

1563
01:22:52,981 --> 01:22:56,917
No. I... you mean...
- I just...

1564
01:22:57,452 --> 01:23:03,391
You mean you want a real kiss.

1565
01:23:03,658 --> 01:23:05,523
A professional kiss.

1566
01:23:06,394 --> 01:23:07,452
Yes.

1567
01:23:10,532 --> 01:23:13,057
Both lips together. Lips.

1568
01:23:13,134 --> 01:23:16,069
I mean, upper and lower lip locked.

1569
01:23:29,150 --> 01:23:30,481
'I had thought about it many times.'

1570
01:23:31,686 --> 01:23:32,880
'But I couldn't do it.'

1571
01:23:33,955 --> 01:23:37,413
'Now when I was kissing Raga...

1572
01:23:37,492 --> 01:23:40,689
...I realised I always wanted this.'

1573
01:23:42,831 --> 01:23:44,423
'Lt was raining heavily.'

1574
01:23:45,634 --> 01:23:48,432
'And I thought the
lightning could strike any moment...

1575
01:23:48,503 --> 01:23:50,027
...and I would die.'

1576
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:52,698
'I couldn't breathe.'

1577
01:23:54,509 --> 01:23:55,703
'I felt I was dying.'

1578
01:23:57,445 --> 01:23:58,503
'And it was wonderful.'

1579
01:23:59,447 --> 01:24:00,505
It was great!

1580
01:24:00,582 --> 01:24:03,574
It was fantastic! It was amazing!

1581
01:24:04,719 --> 01:24:07,449
But we should never do it again.

1582
01:24:07,722 --> 01:24:08,984
Why? What happened?

1583
01:24:10,191 --> 01:24:11,453
Look at us, Raga.

1584
01:24:11,726 --> 01:24:14,923
If you were a bit older and
I was younger, maybe but...

1585
01:24:16,464 --> 01:24:18,193
No, this is never going to work.

1586
01:24:18,466 --> 01:24:19,524
Sure?

1587
01:24:21,202 --> 01:24:23,932
I'm sure! I'm sure!

1588
01:24:24,606 --> 01:24:27,131
But I knew this would end like this?

1589
01:24:29,811 --> 01:24:30,869
Did you?

1590
01:24:31,479 --> 01:24:32,537
Yes.

1591
01:24:38,753 --> 01:24:44,749
Coming out from there,
I headed towards home...

1592
01:24:47,495 --> 01:24:51,090
I don't know, but I
wanted to hold Simi.

1593
01:24:52,233 --> 01:24:55,896
I just wanted to go home,
kiss, and hold Simi.

1594
01:24:59,507 --> 01:25:02,840
'Excuse me! How is everything? '

1595
01:25:02,911 --> 01:25:03,969
Everything, what?

1596
01:25:04,045 --> 01:25:05,239
'How are you? '

1597
01:25:06,982 --> 01:25:08,040
I'm fine.

1598
01:25:08,116 --> 01:25:10,107
Great! Great! Fantastic!

1599
01:25:10,919 --> 01:25:14,514
'We went jogging last
Sunday on the Marine Drive.'

1600
01:25:15,123 --> 01:25:16,181
'Lt felt good.'

1601
01:25:18,526 --> 01:25:19,584
'I work out.'

1602
01:25:19,728 --> 01:25:21,059
'Work out regularly. I go to gym.'

1603
01:25:21,529 --> 01:25:22,723
I've just had a steam sauna.

1604
01:25:23,531 --> 01:25:25,260
And...
- 'You look fit.'

1605
01:25:25,667 --> 01:25:27,532
'You're looking nice.'

1606
01:25:27,602 --> 01:25:29,001
I like myself to be in shape.

1607
01:25:29,738 --> 01:25:30,796
Yes.

1608
01:25:31,139 --> 01:25:35,542
'And, what's happening?
How is life? '

1609
01:25:36,544 --> 01:25:37,602
I eat salad.

1610
01:25:38,279 --> 01:25:40,611
I've stopped eating non-vegetarian
food. I have banned it.

1611
01:25:40,682 --> 01:25:41,808
'Totally? '

1612
01:25:42,283 --> 01:25:44,148
I eat a little
sometimes when I get bored.

1613
01:25:44,686 --> 01:25:47,280
I have to go home.
But I hide it from her.

1614
01:25:48,556 --> 01:25:50,820
'But what do you do at home? '

1615
01:25:54,095 --> 01:25:55,153
Watch TV.

1616
01:25:55,964 --> 01:25:58,956
Recently we watched a DVD.
What was the name...

1617
01:26:00,235 --> 01:26:02,829
Welcome! We watched Welcome.

1618
01:26:02,904 --> 01:26:05,304
It's a fun movie. I
liked it. It was fun.

1619
01:26:05,573 --> 01:26:07,564
I mean I was able to laugh.

1620
01:26:08,576 --> 01:26:12,103
I laughed out loud. I didn't
feel guilty. Without guilt.

1621
01:26:12,180 --> 01:26:14,580
With Mita, I used to feel guilty.

1622
01:26:14,783 --> 01:26:17,115
She doesn't like such films.
She hates such films.

1623
01:26:17,719 --> 01:26:20,051
'Did you meet Mita again? '

1624
01:26:20,588 --> 01:26:23,580
No! It's been a long
time since we met.

1625
01:26:25,593 --> 01:26:28,118
I don't feel guilty.
I don't feel bad.

1626
01:26:28,863 --> 01:26:31,798
But I do miss her sometimes. Yes.

1627
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:33,999
I miss her sometimes.

1628
01:26:35,804 --> 01:26:38,136
'And Kaya? Tell us about Kaya.'

1629
01:26:44,679 --> 01:26:48,206
She's not an intellectual.

1630
01:26:49,884 --> 01:26:52,614
I argue with her sometimes.

1631
01:26:52,687 --> 01:26:54,814
No sir, I sent it last night.
I don't know why it didn't go.

1632
01:26:54,889 --> 01:26:57,619
Maybe... - Look, it went up!
It went up here as well!

1633
01:26:57,692 --> 01:26:58,886
It's in the papers.
- I'll send it right now.

1634
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:01,360
I told you yesterday!
You don't listen!

1635
01:27:01,629 --> 01:27:02,823
It has gone up!
- What?

1636
01:27:02,897 --> 01:27:05,889
It has gone up! From 5000 to 9000.

1637
01:27:06,901 --> 01:27:08,630
Sensex is not about
the its last three...

1638
01:27:08,703 --> 01:27:10,637
...letters but about
company shares. Okay?

1639
01:27:11,639 --> 01:27:12,697
Very smart!

1640
01:27:13,041 --> 01:27:16,238
Even the company guys can't live
without physical intimacy. Got that?

1641
01:27:16,845 --> 01:27:19,643
I mean small ones. Nothing serious.

1642
01:27:19,714 --> 01:27:21,045
We have small arguments.

1643
01:27:21,649 --> 01:27:24,641
'Do you think the
decision of living with Kaya...

1644
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:26,653
...and leaving Mita, was right? '

1645
01:27:26,721 --> 01:27:27,779
What?

1646
01:27:27,856 --> 01:27:30,256
'I mean, you are with Kaya
and you left your wife.'

1647
01:27:30,925 --> 01:27:31,983
What do you mean?

1648
01:27:32,060 --> 01:27:33,925
'You left your wife and
are living with Kaya... '

1649
01:27:33,995 --> 01:27:35,394
What do you mean whether the
decision is right or wrong?

1650
01:27:35,663 --> 01:27:36,721
What?

1651
01:27:36,798 --> 01:27:38,789
'Don't people ask you? '
- Listen!

1652
01:27:38,867 --> 01:27:40,334
What do you mean whether the
decision is right or wrong?

1653
01:27:40,401 --> 01:27:41,663
'I mean you left your wife... '

1654
01:27:41,736 --> 01:27:44,398
'What do you say to them? But
still! ' - Please! Please! Enough!

1655
01:27:54,749 --> 01:27:56,216
Hi Samit!
- Hi!

1656
01:27:56,284 --> 01:27:58,809
Looking good!
- Yes.

1657
01:27:59,154 --> 01:28:00,883
Nobody can guess your age.

1658
01:28:01,689 --> 01:28:02,747
Do you go to gym?

1659
01:28:04,159 --> 01:28:08,960
Yes! I go to gym. I'm swimming.
I'm into yoga. And...

1660
01:28:09,030 --> 01:28:10,691
Is my face radiant?

1661
01:28:10,765 --> 01:28:12,426
Yes.
- Is there brilliance?

1662
01:28:12,700 --> 01:28:13,758
Yes.
- Yes?

1663
01:28:14,102 --> 01:28:15,228
It works.

1664
01:28:15,703 --> 01:28:18,433
Reduce fat. Enhance the breasts.

1665
01:28:18,706 --> 01:28:21,174
Or tone the love handles or
you want to shape your abs.

1666
01:28:21,242 --> 01:28:22,709
I have exercises for all of this.

1667
01:28:22,777 --> 01:28:23,903
Should I show you?

1668
01:28:24,179 --> 01:28:25,305
Come on, uncle. Stand up.

1669
01:28:26,314 --> 01:28:28,248
And bring your
chair forward quickly.

1670
01:28:30,852 --> 01:28:32,114
And sit in the chair.

1671
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:33,719
Not here. Up there.

1672
01:28:33,855 --> 01:28:35,186
Aunt!
- I will fall.

1673
01:28:35,256 --> 01:28:36,780
I am calling aunt.

1674
01:28:36,858 --> 01:28:38,792
Aunt, come here and
hold him by the waist.

1675
01:28:38,860 --> 01:28:42,318
I had met Mita. She
is dating someone.

1676
01:28:42,730 --> 01:28:44,391
Ritu, tell him!
- Dating?

1677
01:28:44,732 --> 01:28:46,723
Yes.
- I'll be right back.

1678
01:28:46,801 --> 01:28:47,859
Okay, sir. I'll join you.

1679
01:28:49,737 --> 01:28:50,795
She's dating?

1680
01:28:50,872 --> 01:28:52,134
Yes, he is an editor.

1681
01:28:52,473 --> 01:28:56,341
Mita? Is she seriously dating?

1682
01:28:56,878 --> 01:28:58,004
That we don't know.

1683
01:28:59,013 --> 01:29:01,880
Don't mind but you left a nice girl.

1684
01:29:02,483 --> 01:29:04,417
He is also enjoying.

1685
01:29:06,754 --> 01:29:08,278
No, but he's right.

1686
01:29:09,424 --> 01:29:12,359
Mita is nice. Mita!

1687
01:29:13,027 --> 01:29:16,485
She looked nice. She has
changed her hairstyle.

1688
01:29:16,764 --> 01:29:17,822
Changed her hairstyle?
- Let's go.

1689
01:29:17,899 --> 01:29:20,959
Okay, good to see. Bye-bye.

1690
01:29:21,035 --> 01:29:22,764
See you.
- See you.

1691
01:29:27,375 --> 01:29:28,433
Where is Kaya?

1692
01:29:29,510 --> 01:29:31,774
One!
- Breathe in!

1693
01:29:33,781 --> 01:29:35,373
Breathe out!

1694
01:29:35,516 --> 01:29:36,778
Number two. Two!

1695
01:29:36,851 --> 01:29:38,512
Breathe out!

1696
01:29:42,190 --> 01:29:45,318
Three!
- Three!

1697
01:29:45,460 --> 01:29:46,859
Breathe in!

1698
01:29:47,795 --> 01:29:48,853
Excuse me!

1699
01:29:48,930 --> 01:29:50,397
Aunt, hold your breath!

1700
01:29:50,465 --> 01:29:54,401
My God! What is she doing?
- Four!

1701
01:29:54,469 --> 01:29:56,198
Kaya!
- Yes Samit! - What is this?

1702
01:29:56,271 --> 01:30:00,799
I am showing them new
aerobic exercises. - Okay.

1703
01:30:00,942 --> 01:30:04,537
Five!
- Five!

1704
01:30:04,812 --> 01:30:06,541
They are so fat and unfit!

1705
01:30:07,415 --> 01:30:11,078
No, they are not unfit,
Kaya. We have to go.

1706
01:30:11,286 --> 01:30:13,811
Samit, why don't you show
them what you do every morning...

1707
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:16,823
...before going to toilet?
- Toilet?

1708
01:30:18,293 --> 01:30:22,093
Yes. - Samit, don't be a
spoil sport. Show them.

1709
01:30:22,163 --> 01:30:23,892
Excuse me.
- Samit, please!

1710
01:30:24,165 --> 01:30:25,826
Excuse me, sir.
- It's still 11 pm.

1711
01:30:25,900 --> 01:30:26,958
Okay. Come on!

1712
01:30:27,035 --> 01:30:30,027
You said we can stay until 1.
- Yes!

1713
01:30:30,305 --> 01:30:32,102
Yes! Not now. Come on!

1714
01:30:32,173 --> 01:30:34,505
Samit! Uncle, bye. Aunt, bye.

1715
01:30:34,842 --> 01:30:38,175
Write down my number.
Mobile, 98777...

1716
01:30:38,246 --> 01:30:40,578
I'll give your number.
- 564, Okay?

1717
01:30:40,848 --> 01:30:43,442
I'm going to print the cards.
Please call me.

1718
01:30:43,851 --> 01:30:45,318
Don't you know what to talk where?

1719
01:30:45,386 --> 01:30:48,048
Can't you just keep quiet? Do
you have to blabber all the time?

1720
01:30:48,122 --> 01:30:50,249
You are jealous of me!
- Oh, God! Shut up!

1721
01:30:50,325 --> 01:30:52,589
How can you talk to me like this?

1722
01:30:52,860 --> 01:30:54,589
In front of everybody! So rudely!

1723
01:30:54,862 --> 01:30:56,989
But what were you
doing over there? What?

1724
01:30:57,065 --> 01:30:59,590
No one has insulted me like this.

1725
01:30:59,867 --> 01:31:02,859
I don't want to create a scene.
All this aerobics is just...

1726
01:31:02,937 --> 01:31:05,872
...nonsense.
- It's not nonsense!

1727
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:08,875
I am sick and tired
of your herbal stuff.

1728
01:31:08,943 --> 01:31:10,877
Every morning, oh God!

1729
01:31:10,945 --> 01:31:13,880
Every morning, yoga, jogging,
meditation...

1730
01:31:13,948 --> 01:31:17,406
...it's all nonsense! Lts crap!
Okay? - Don't touch me!

1731
01:31:17,485 --> 01:31:19,885
Come on!
- How can you talk to me like this?

1732
01:31:20,288 --> 01:31:22,279
You want to embarrass
me here? Embarrass me?

1733
01:31:22,357 --> 01:31:23,619
These are serious people.
Rich people!

1734
01:31:23,891 --> 01:31:24,949
They talk of serious things.

1735
01:31:25,026 --> 01:31:26,152
And you open your shop over there.

1736
01:31:26,227 --> 01:31:28,024
Don't you dare call it a shop!

1737
01:31:28,096 --> 01:31:30,030
It's a shop! It's a shop!

1738
01:31:30,098 --> 01:31:31,497
Come! Come on!
- I'm not coming!

1739
01:31:31,566 --> 01:31:33,158
Go! You have to go!
- I'm not coming!

1740
01:31:33,234 --> 01:31:34,895
You have to go! We have to...
- I'm not coming!

1741
01:31:34,969 --> 01:31:37,164
All right it's not a shop.
Come on. Come.

1742
01:31:37,238 --> 01:31:38,364
Come!
- Oh Samit!

1743
01:31:38,439 --> 01:31:41,567
Come! Come! - I don't
want to go home! Let me go!

1744
01:31:46,914 --> 01:31:49,576
Are you mad? Are you mad?

1745
01:31:49,650 --> 01:31:52,915
I'll shout so loudly! I'll
embarrass you with my shouting!

1746
01:31:53,521 --> 01:31:55,921
Are you threatening me? Are
you threatening me? - Yes!

1747
01:31:57,058 --> 01:31:58,992
Okay, shout! Let's see.
How loudly you can scream?

1748
01:32:00,595 --> 01:32:04,395
I hate you and I hate your
stupid colleagues! - No!

1749
01:32:04,465 --> 01:32:06,660
No! No!
- Yes! Yes!

1750
01:32:06,934 --> 01:32:09,926
You'll ruin me! You'll ruin me!

1751
01:32:14,275 --> 01:32:15,469
Come!

1752
01:32:15,543 --> 01:32:17,408
I'm not coming!
- Please come.

1753
01:32:17,478 --> 01:32:19,946
I'm not coming!
- Come!

1754
01:33:09,664 --> 01:33:11,154
'What happened
between you and Veer? '

1755
01:33:11,532 --> 01:33:12,590
Nothing.

1756
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,058
Nothing.

1757
01:33:14,469 --> 01:33:15,527
In fact, nothing at all.

1758
01:33:17,338 --> 01:33:18,430
'What do you mean? '

1759
01:33:20,508 --> 01:33:21,668
My mind is always racing.

1760
01:33:22,410 --> 01:33:23,468
It doesn't stop.

1761
01:33:24,078 --> 01:33:25,136
You'll laugh if you hear about it.

1762
01:33:25,713 --> 01:33:27,476
'Like. Like what? '

1763
01:33:29,750 --> 01:33:33,083
I liked whatever Veer was doing.

1764
01:33:33,621 --> 01:33:35,054
He was different than Samit.

1765
01:33:35,289 --> 01:33:37,052
'More gentle and exciting.'

1766
01:33:38,359 --> 01:33:40,020
'Then I started thinking...

1767
01:33:40,094 --> 01:33:42,085
...Veer's thinking was so
different than Samit.'

1768
01:33:42,730 --> 01:33:44,220
'His thoughts are so deep.'

1769
01:33:45,433 --> 01:33:49,096
'Then I thought Veer
is like a tortoise.'

1770
01:33:49,470 --> 01:33:52,098
'He was very slow and easy.'

1771
01:33:52,607 --> 01:33:55,235
'And Samit? Samit was the rabbit.'

1772
01:33:55,710 --> 01:33:58,338
'Fast and quick!
Without enjoying the moment.'

1773
01:34:00,715 --> 01:34:03,240
'Then I thought Simi was
also like a tortoise.'

1774
01:34:03,718 --> 01:34:05,117
'And Rishi is the rabbit.'

1775
01:34:05,720 --> 01:34:09,121
'Then I thought
about all those I knew.'

1776
01:34:09,323 --> 01:34:11,723
'Who was a rabbit and
who was the tortoise.'

1777
01:34:12,059 --> 01:34:15,495
'Leslie was a friend. He
was a rabbit. His wife.'

1778
01:34:15,563 --> 01:34:17,326
You're not concentrating.

1779
01:34:18,065 --> 01:34:24,095
Oh!
- No. Not at all.

1780
01:34:32,413 --> 01:34:33,471
What was that sound?

1781
01:34:35,716 --> 01:34:37,149
There have been thefts here.

1782
01:34:37,218 --> 01:34:38,583
Have you locked the door?

1783
01:34:38,719 --> 01:34:40,812
Yes! I think so.

1784
01:34:42,323 --> 01:34:43,483
Veer!

1785
01:34:52,166 --> 01:34:53,633
Veer, call the police!

1786
01:35:06,847 --> 01:35:09,247
Hello! Who are you?

1787
01:35:09,717 --> 01:35:11,480
Who are you?
- Me?

1788
01:35:11,819 --> 01:35:13,309
Who are you?
- Who are you?

1789
01:35:13,521 --> 01:35:14,579
What?
- Who are you?

1790
01:35:15,823 --> 01:35:18,519
Are you crazy? Who are...
- Samit! You?

1791
01:35:22,129 --> 01:35:23,187
Mita!

1792
01:35:24,165 --> 01:35:25,655
Why did you change the locks?

1793
01:35:26,167 --> 01:35:27,794
And...
- Who is he?

1794
01:35:28,169 --> 01:35:30,194
Him? He is my husband!

1795
01:35:30,338 --> 01:35:32,169
It's none of your business. Get out!

1796
01:35:32,239 --> 01:35:34,139
No, I'm not going.
- Is there a problem?

1797
01:35:34,208 --> 01:35:35,300
Is there a problem? Problem?
- Problem with whom?

1798
01:35:35,376 --> 01:35:36,434
With me?

1799
01:35:36,510 --> 01:35:37,875
Being here!
- What is he doing here? What?

1800
01:35:38,145 --> 01:35:40,807
Look, she said leave!
- Is he sleeping with you?

1801
01:35:40,881 --> 01:35:43,315
Watch your tongue!
- It's not a matter of my tongue!

1802
01:35:43,384 --> 01:35:45,147
It's a matter of husband
and wife! She's my wife!

1803
01:35:45,219 --> 01:35:46,277
Okay stop!

1804
01:35:46,354 --> 01:35:48,219
Veer, please go upstairs.
I'll handle him.

1805
01:35:48,356 --> 01:35:49,414
Are you sure?
- Yes.

1806
01:35:51,659 --> 01:35:52,819
Upstairs? Where is he going?
- Hey look!

1807
01:35:52,893 --> 01:35:54,224
Listen!
- I know what I'm doing!

1808
01:35:54,428 --> 01:35:56,191
He's going in our bedroom, Mita!

1809
01:35:56,330 --> 01:35:58,321
It's not your
bedroom now! It's mine.

1810
01:35:58,399 --> 01:36:00,230
Our bedroom! Ours!
- Have coffee and leave, Samit!

1811
01:36:02,303 --> 01:36:03,361
What?

1812
01:36:03,504 --> 01:36:04,835
What, are you doing?

1813
01:36:04,905 --> 01:36:06,702
I want to come back, Mita.
- What?

1814
01:36:06,841 --> 01:36:07,899
I love you, Mita! Mita!

1815
01:36:08,175 --> 01:36:09,472
Are you drunk?

1816
01:36:11,779 --> 01:36:12,905
God, I'm a goner!

1817
01:36:13,347 --> 01:36:14,405
Samit, this is neither
the time and the place...

1818
01:36:14,482 --> 01:36:15,779
...for such conversation.

1819
01:36:15,916 --> 01:36:17,850
Go away! Get out! Right now! Go!
- No!

1820
01:36:17,918 --> 01:36:20,478
Samit!
- No! This is my house!

1821
01:36:20,688 --> 01:36:21,780
No! No!
- This is my house!

1822
01:36:21,856 --> 01:36:24,222
This is not your house!
- Go. - Right now.

1823
01:36:24,358 --> 01:36:25,620
This is my house!
- This is not your house!

1824
01:36:25,693 --> 01:36:26,751
- Go. - Right now. - This
is my house. - It us ours!

1825
01:36:26,827 --> 01:36:28,192
And I'm going to throw you
out of it! - It is ours!

1826
01:36:28,262 --> 01:36:32,221
It's my house! - Okay, I made
a mistake. A big mistake, Mita!

1827
01:36:33,668 --> 01:36:35,260
You don't know how important
your relationship is for me!

1828
01:36:35,336 --> 01:36:36,928
I... can't live without you.

1829
01:36:37,204 --> 01:36:38,330
Mita!
- I want to...

1830
01:36:38,406 --> 01:36:41,204
Man, just forget it!
Please leave us alone.

1831
01:36:41,275 --> 01:36:42,401
Mita!
- Please! - Please!

1832
01:36:42,476 --> 01:36:43,534
Just give me two minutes.
He's leaving.

1833
01:36:43,611 --> 01:36:45,875
You're leaving! - I want to
restore our relationship, Mita!

1834
01:36:45,946 --> 01:36:47,880
No, Samit.
- How ridiculous!

1835
01:36:47,948 --> 01:36:49,939
Look! What is happening?

1836
01:36:50,217 --> 01:36:52,208
Why have you trimmed your hair?
Look! Lts looks strange!

1837
01:36:52,286 --> 01:36:53,344
My hair looks good!

1838
01:36:53,421 --> 01:36:54,479
Have you seen
yourself in the mirror?

1839
01:36:54,555 --> 01:36:55,886
What's this bush on your head?
- Bush!

1840
01:36:56,424 --> 01:36:57,891
I want you out. Get out!
- I'll change it.

1841
01:36:57,958 --> 01:36:59,949
Get out! I'm serious!
Get out! Right now!

1842
01:37:00,227 --> 01:37:01,421
No! No!
- That's it! Okay?

1843
01:37:01,495 --> 01:37:02,553
No! No!

1844
01:37:02,630 --> 01:37:03,892
Please stop this!
Don't act childish!

1845
01:37:03,964 --> 01:37:06,489
No! No! You too are
at fault. Not just I.

1846
01:37:06,567 --> 01:37:08,728
When did I say it's
just your fault? I didn't!

1847
01:37:08,869 --> 01:37:10,803
You should understand it's so
hard to live with you. - Really?

1848
01:37:10,871 --> 01:37:11,963
I used to live with you because...
- What do you want to say?

1849
01:37:12,239 --> 01:37:14,298
I love you!
- Was our marriage full of problems?

1850
01:37:14,375 --> 01:37:16,240
Yes! We both had problems!

1851
01:37:16,310 --> 01:37:18,972
But, you cheated on me, Samit!
You lied to me!

1852
01:37:19,313 --> 01:37:20,610
You were sleeping with someone else!

1853
01:37:21,949 --> 01:37:24,440
All right. Scream! Scream
out loud! Let everybody listen!

1854
01:37:24,518 --> 01:37:26,315
He knows it!
- He is there! He knows it!

1855
01:37:26,387 --> 01:37:27,854
Yes, he knows everything!
He knows everything!

1856
01:37:27,922 --> 01:37:28,980
Very good! Very good!

1857
01:37:29,256 --> 01:37:30,314
He knows everything!

1858
01:37:30,391 --> 01:37:31,449
He knows everything!

1859
01:37:31,959 --> 01:37:33,984
Mita, he knows everything?
- Yes, he knows everything!

1860
01:37:34,495 --> 01:37:35,985
Mita, listen. You tell me.

1861
01:37:36,797 --> 01:37:39,823
Show me a couple in this
world who don't have problems.

1862
01:37:39,900 --> 01:37:41,834
Really? - But that doesn't
mean you can call him husband.

1863
01:37:41,902 --> 01:37:43,665
And what about the one you
are living with? With her?

1864
01:37:43,838 --> 01:37:44,896
No, Mita, that's nonsense!

1865
01:37:44,972 --> 01:37:47,805
Anyway, I've also
found someone I like.

1866
01:37:48,609 --> 01:37:49,701
You what?

1867
01:37:50,311 --> 01:37:52,370
I've also found someone I like.

1868
01:37:54,014 --> 01:37:55,982
Mita! Mita!

1869
01:37:57,952 --> 01:38:00,819
Mita, what about those
years we spent together?

1870
01:38:00,888 --> 01:38:01,946
How dare you!

1871
01:38:02,022 --> 01:38:04,957
Oh, baby... - You never thought
of them when things suited you!

1872
01:38:05,025 --> 01:38:06,583
Tell me!

1873
01:38:06,961 --> 01:38:09,691
Where were you?
- Tell me!

1874
01:38:09,830 --> 01:38:13,322
I'll tell you. I'll tell you.
Listen. I was confused.

1875
01:38:13,467 --> 01:38:15,628
I lost my balance
of my body and mind.

1876
01:38:15,770 --> 01:38:18,637
My body was taking over and
it was affecting my decisions.

1877
01:38:18,706 --> 01:38:19,968
God, no!
- Yes. You know...

1878
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:21,871
I can't hear this anymore.
I want you to leave Samit.

1879
01:38:21,942 --> 01:38:24,968
Listen! - We'll talk about this
tomorrow! - Not tomorrow! Tomorrow?

1880
01:38:25,045 --> 01:38:26,535
Not tomorrow! Tomorrow, I will die.

1881
01:38:27,014 --> 01:38:29,380
Mita, please save me from tomorrow!

1882
01:38:29,517 --> 01:38:30,984
No, Samit!
- Mita, I will die!

1883
01:38:31,051 --> 01:38:32,985
Samit, please don't do this!
- Listen! Listen!

1884
01:38:33,053 --> 01:38:35,044
I can't take this! Please! Look!
- See!

1885
01:38:35,322 --> 01:38:36,516
I'm very confused. Please!

1886
01:38:36,590 --> 01:38:40,959
Look how our names are.
Sa-mit. Mi-tu.

1887
01:38:41,328 --> 01:38:43,421
Sa-mit. Mi-tu.
- Please Samit!

1888
01:38:43,497 --> 01:38:44,725
They are into each other.
- Please, you leave, Samit.

1889
01:38:44,799 --> 01:38:45,925
- We are made for each other.

1890
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,058
I love you! I love you!

1891
01:38:47,334 --> 01:38:50,929
I love you from my guts, Mita!
I missed you. I missed your smile.

1892
01:38:51,372 --> 01:38:53,602
I missed your smile. - Why are you
like this? Why don't you understand?

1893
01:38:53,741 --> 01:38:54,867
I missed your smell.

1894
01:38:57,845 --> 01:39:00,746
Who is it now?
- Who is it? Forget him.

1895
01:39:00,815 --> 01:39:01,873
Don't get the door.
- No.

1896
01:39:01,949 --> 01:39:03,007
Let's run away!

1897
01:39:03,083 --> 01:39:05,813
We'll go away somewhere. Let
it be! Mita! Mita, listen!

1898
01:39:05,953 --> 01:39:07,011
Wait.

1899
01:39:11,358 --> 01:39:12,416
I want to meet Samit.

1900
01:39:12,593 --> 01:39:13,924
Oh my God!

1901
01:39:14,361 --> 01:39:16,022
I had forbidden her to come in!

1902
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:18,087
Get out! Get out
from under the table!

1903
01:39:18,632 --> 01:39:21,567
Get out or else I'm coming in!

1904
01:39:22,036 --> 01:39:23,094
Get out!

1905
01:39:23,370 --> 01:39:25,031
I told you not to come here!

1906
01:39:25,105 --> 01:39:26,766
Get out or else I'm coming in!

1907
01:39:27,541 --> 01:39:30,442
Why did you come in? - You
left me in the car for an hour!

1908
01:39:33,113 --> 01:39:35,775
Saw that? How you are
destroying my life, Mita?

1909
01:39:36,083 --> 01:39:37,482
Look!
- You chose her?

1910
01:39:37,985 --> 01:39:40,647
Live with her! Great choice!

1911
01:39:40,788 --> 01:39:41,846
Kaya!

1912
01:39:48,996 --> 01:39:50,429
Come here. You too join us.

1913
01:39:50,598 --> 01:39:52,065
This is about the four
of us. This is no secret.

1914
01:39:52,132 --> 01:39:53,394
Please come! Come.

1915
01:39:55,469 --> 01:39:59,599
Take it out! I gave you the
g-string! Remove it right now!

1916
01:40:00,007 --> 01:40:01,975
What? G-string?

1917
01:40:02,042 --> 01:40:03,100
Right now?
- Yes.

1918
01:40:03,744 --> 01:40:04,972
I want it right now!
- Here?

1919
01:40:05,045 --> 01:40:06,478
Yes, here!

1920
01:40:06,747 --> 01:40:08,612
Stop it!
- How can I take it out now?

1921
01:40:08,682 --> 01:40:10,411
Stop! - I don't know! I
want my g-string. Stop!

1922
01:40:10,484 --> 01:40:12,816
Stop this!
- I want it...

1923
01:40:13,020 --> 01:40:14,681
All of you! Just get out!

1924
01:40:17,091 --> 01:40:18,149
Mita! Mita, listen!

1925
01:40:18,425 --> 01:40:19,619
I want my g-string.

1926
01:40:20,160 --> 01:40:22,094
I will give it to you right now.
- I want my g-string!

1927
01:40:22,162 --> 01:40:25,097
I'll give it right now! Okay?
- I want my g-string!

1928
01:40:25,165 --> 01:40:29,158
Mita, do you still
have my briefs here?

1929
01:40:29,436 --> 01:40:30,494
I'll give it right away!

1930
01:40:30,571 --> 01:40:31,970
I want my g-string!

1931
01:40:36,877 --> 01:40:38,572
Hi, I'm Veer, by the way.

1932
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:40,538
I'm Kaya.

1933
01:40:41,115 --> 01:40:45,916
And, I'm an aerobics instructor.
I'm going to print my cards.

1934
01:40:46,120 --> 01:40:50,853
And my number is 98777564.

1935
01:40:53,193 --> 01:40:56,060
Please feed it in your mobile.
- Okay.

1936
01:40:58,198 --> 01:41:00,996
I teach very good aerobic
exercises. Should I show you?

1937
01:41:01,201 --> 01:41:03,135
98?
- 777.

1938
01:41:03,203 --> 01:41:06,070
777.
- 564.

1939
01:41:06,573 --> 01:41:10,475
987?
- 777564.

1940
01:41:10,544 --> 01:41:11,670
5...
- 64.

1941
01:41:11,812 --> 01:41:12,870
64.
- Yes.

1942
01:41:12,947 --> 01:41:16,075
And your name is...
- Take this!

1943
01:41:16,483 --> 01:41:17,541
Not this one!

1944
01:41:17,785 --> 01:41:19,480
This is not for your!

1945
01:41:20,187 --> 01:41:23,156
Please mind your things.
Take them with you!

1946
01:41:24,091 --> 01:41:28,221
I want my g-string!

1947
01:41:32,499 --> 01:41:36,526
98?
- 777564.

1948
01:41:42,576 --> 01:41:43,634
'Hi! '

1949
01:41:43,844 --> 01:41:45,038
You again?

1950
01:41:45,512 --> 01:41:47,241
Why can't you, just let me be?

1951
01:41:47,548 --> 01:41:50,711
'I hear you went to
Mita again that night.'

1952
01:41:50,851 --> 01:41:53,046
I did. She's my wife.
I can't go to her?

1953
01:41:53,253 --> 01:41:55,847
'Are you trying to go back to her? '

1954
01:41:55,923 --> 01:41:59,154
Yes. I'm trying. Can't you
see this? Can't you see this?

1955
01:41:59,593 --> 01:42:01,857
'Ls it some lingerie or something? '

1956
01:42:04,732 --> 01:42:10,068
Is this lingerie? These are books,
DVD's, foreign films.

1957
01:42:10,270 --> 01:42:11,703
Art books, cooking books.

1958
01:42:11,772 --> 01:42:12,898
'You're not an arty type.'

1959
01:42:12,973 --> 01:42:14,998
No. I love art! Any problem?

1960
01:42:16,577 --> 01:42:19,068
'Sir... '
- No comment! No comment!

1961
01:42:19,246 --> 01:42:22,010
'Sir, what happened to
your bedroom adventures? '

1962
01:42:22,149 --> 01:42:24,674
Don't talk to me
of such ugly things?

1963
01:42:24,818 --> 01:42:27,150
Why do you say such things?
It destroys a man's life.

1964
01:42:27,721 --> 01:42:31,282
He gets ruined. He loses his senses.

1965
01:42:31,592 --> 01:42:33,685
It disturbs the
balance of body and mind.

1966
01:42:33,827 --> 01:42:36,694
Got it? Don't talk of such things.

1967
01:42:36,830 --> 01:42:37,888
Okay?

1968
01:42:37,965 --> 01:42:39,956
'Has everything been
resolved between Mita and you? '

1969
01:42:42,870 --> 01:42:46,306
Not yet. And the
chances are very slim.

1970
01:42:47,174 --> 01:42:48,641
But I'm trying very hard.

1971
01:42:49,743 --> 01:42:50,801
Let's see.

1972
01:42:52,079 --> 01:42:53,137
God knows.

1973
01:42:54,148 --> 01:42:55,809
You ask me about
physical intimacy all the time?

1974
01:42:55,883 --> 01:42:58,750
Just for the sake of
physical intimacy. It's a disease.

1975
01:42:59,086 --> 01:43:00,246
You shouldn't get addicted to it.

1976
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:03,619
A companion is a companion.
You know.

1977
01:43:03,757 --> 01:43:05,190
'And... '
- Now I realize this.

1978
01:43:05,259 --> 01:43:09,593
'And sweet Bopara and Kaya... You
liked names like Sweety Bopara.'

1979
01:43:09,663 --> 01:43:13,326
'Sweety candy! '
- No! - 'Sweety Bopara! ' - No!

1980
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:15,067
Get lost!
- 'Pochkoo! '

1981
01:43:15,335 --> 01:43:16,632
This is a fact.

1982
01:43:16,703 --> 01:43:17,897
And...
- No.

1983
01:43:19,206 --> 01:43:21,003
And this is the biggest
reality that I love you.

1984
01:43:22,876 --> 01:43:24,741
I accept I made a mistake.

1985
01:43:25,112 --> 01:43:26,807
You make mistakes, I'm human.

1986
01:43:27,981 --> 01:43:30,745
And you too. You too have
found someone so quickly.

1987
01:43:30,884 --> 01:43:32,044
We did nothing.

1988
01:43:32,886 --> 01:43:35,252
Nothing?
- Do you doubt me, Samit?

1989
01:43:35,889 --> 01:43:39,154
No! No, how can I doubt you?

1990
01:43:40,027 --> 01:43:42,689
How can I doubt you?
I'm a nice person.

1991
01:43:42,963 --> 01:43:44,021
I have a big heart.

1992
01:43:44,198 --> 01:43:46,792
I know people make mistakes and...

1993
01:43:46,867 --> 01:43:49,131
I forgive you, Mita. Forgive you.

1994
01:43:49,203 --> 01:43:52,366
You forgive me?
- Yes. No?

1995
01:43:53,707 --> 01:43:55,038
Okay. Okay.

1996
01:43:55,209 --> 01:43:58,144
It's not a question of
me forgiving you. Okay?

1997
01:43:58,712 --> 01:44:01,738
You forgive me. Okay?
- Okay.

1998
01:44:01,882 --> 01:44:02,940
Happy?
- Yes.

1999
01:44:03,083 --> 01:44:04,141
Okay.

2000
01:44:04,284 --> 01:44:06,878
Okay. Okay.

2001
01:44:09,690 --> 01:44:10,748
What did you say?

2002
01:44:11,024 --> 01:44:13,049
Rishi came home and
started to explain to me.

2003
01:44:13,327 --> 01:44:14,794
He was saying we are getting old.

2004
01:44:14,862 --> 01:44:17,729
I don't know why he
says we are getting old.

2005
01:44:18,198 --> 01:44:21,065
But then I realised
that he was right.

2006
01:44:21,668 --> 01:44:22,726
We are getting old.

2007
01:44:24,238 --> 01:44:25,398
You think I'm old?

2008
01:44:29,877 --> 01:44:32,812
How can you be old? I'm getting old.

2009
01:44:34,815 --> 01:44:37,716
You're my Sweety Bopara.

2010
01:44:42,723 --> 01:44:43,781
Sweety what?

2011
01:44:43,857 --> 01:44:44,949
Bopara!

2012
01:44:46,827 --> 01:44:48,294
Bopara! Means what?

2013
01:44:49,830 --> 01:44:52,025
Oh no! Just drop Bopara.

2014
01:44:52,766 --> 01:44:54,097
Drop Bopara. You're just Sweety.

2015
01:44:56,436 --> 01:44:57,698
Samit and Mita re-united
after one week.

2016
01:44:57,771 --> 01:44:58,931
This occasion was
celebrated on dinner.

2017
01:45:05,779 --> 01:45:06,837
Thanks.

2018
01:45:06,914 --> 01:45:10,975
Everybody fools around!
But what really matters is...

2019
01:45:13,187 --> 01:45:15,314
...what we learn from it.

2020
01:45:16,256 --> 01:45:17,314
Right?

2021
01:45:17,457 --> 01:45:19,448
I think the real test is
to survive this crisis.

2022
01:45:19,726 --> 01:45:20,784
Right?
- Yes.

2023
01:45:21,395 --> 01:45:22,453
I think that's great.

2024
01:45:23,263 --> 01:45:26,926
I mean if you can become
so mature... It's tough.

2025
01:45:27,334 --> 01:45:28,460
But I think it's great.

2026
01:45:28,735 --> 01:45:29,793
It's not about maturity.

2027
01:45:29,870 --> 01:45:34,466
But you realize what your
priorities are in life. You know.

2028
01:45:35,342 --> 01:45:37,742
How long can you talk about
fitness and aerobics? - Yes.

2029
01:45:40,480 --> 01:45:42,471
Your Veer was not so smart.

2030
01:45:42,883 --> 01:45:44,009
How is Veer?

2031
01:45:45,352 --> 01:45:47,149
I don't know. He was sick.

2032
01:45:47,354 --> 01:45:49,219
When I called he was in a bad shape.

2033
01:45:53,493 --> 01:45:55,484
He must have been shocked.

2034
01:45:56,964 --> 01:46:00,764
Actually, Simi is Veer's real crush.

2035
01:46:04,905 --> 01:46:05,963
Not to offend you Rishi!

2036
01:46:06,373 --> 01:46:09,774
I like it if someone loves Simi.

2037
01:46:10,244 --> 01:46:11,370
Really?
- Yes.

2038
01:46:11,511 --> 01:46:13,502
Yes, Rishi is always
looking for a second opinion.

2039
01:46:13,914 --> 01:46:15,506
As far as I am concerned.

2040
01:46:15,782 --> 01:46:17,773
What are you saying?
That's not fair. - Of course.

2041
01:46:19,386 --> 01:46:22,184
Rishi, if I were you
I'll be a little careful.

2042
01:46:22,789 --> 01:46:23,847
Why?

2043
01:46:23,924 --> 01:46:28,327
Veer talks about Simi lovingly
and with a suppressed voice.

2044
01:46:31,531 --> 01:46:33,396
I think he is really
impressed with your poetry.

2045
01:46:37,404 --> 01:46:38,530
Poetry?

2046
01:46:39,406 --> 01:46:40,464
Poetry!?

2047
01:46:44,344 --> 01:46:45,402
Cheers!

2048
01:46:49,349 --> 01:46:50,407
Cheers!

2049
01:46:50,484 --> 01:46:52,076
Cheers!

2050
01:46:55,222 --> 01:46:57,281
Why didn't you show me your poems?

2051
01:46:57,557 --> 01:46:58,819
As thought you care.
- Why not?

2052
01:46:59,159 --> 01:47:00,217
I'm just not comfortable.

2053
01:47:00,294 --> 01:47:01,352
Why?

2054
01:47:01,428 --> 01:47:02,554
Because you are very critical.

2055
01:47:03,230 --> 01:47:04,288
What nonsense!

2056
01:47:04,364 --> 01:47:05,558
I like poetry.

2057
01:47:06,833 --> 01:47:07,891
Do you love him?

2058
01:47:08,035 --> 01:47:10,230
Why? Just because I
gave him some poems?

2059
01:47:10,904 --> 01:47:11,962
Don't be silly.

2060
01:47:12,572 --> 01:47:14,836
Excuse me! I don't flirt.

2061
01:47:14,975 --> 01:47:17,842
Don't lie. I've seen you.
You change altogether.

2062
01:47:17,978 --> 01:47:20,879
Really? Like what? Come on!
- Like...

2063
01:47:21,248 --> 01:47:23,910
Like, 'I'd own an island.'

2064
01:47:24,051 --> 01:47:27,043
'And a yacht. I would live
on an island for six months.'

2065
01:47:27,187 --> 01:47:28,245
You know, that's flirting.

2066
01:47:28,588 --> 01:47:30,852
I know you can't live out of Mumbai.

2067
01:47:33,327 --> 01:47:34,851
You liked me because...

2068
01:47:34,928 --> 01:47:37,260
...I reminded you of your
ex-girlfriend, Juhi. Right?

2069
01:47:37,397 --> 01:47:38,864
But then you discovered I'm
decent and not crazy like her.

2070
01:47:38,932 --> 01:47:40,263
No!

2071
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:43,995
I chose you because you
were decent. Not crazy or mad!

2072
01:47:44,137 --> 01:47:46,264
Yes, that's what bored you.

2073
01:47:46,406 --> 01:47:49,136
No! In fact now I think
you are crazy and mad!

2074
01:47:50,277 --> 01:47:52,074
So, do I remind you of Juhi?

2075
01:47:53,213 --> 01:47:56,148
You had said it! You had
said you want a divorce!

2076
01:47:56,483 --> 01:47:57,609
Don't lie! It was not me!

2077
01:47:57,884 --> 01:48:00,478
I remember it very
clearly you had said it.

2078
01:48:00,620 --> 01:48:03,953
You said it first when
you had read that survey...

2079
01:48:04,024 --> 01:48:05,082
'Am I good in bed? '

2080
01:48:05,158 --> 01:48:07,626
What survey? I just
asked it casually. Survey?

2081
01:48:07,894 --> 01:48:10,158
No, and I was quite
because I didn't want to lie.

2082
01:48:10,297 --> 01:48:12,424
And I was afraid our
fight would get worse.

2083
01:48:12,566 --> 01:48:14,966
Lie? What do you mean?

2084
01:48:16,036 --> 01:48:17,162
Nothing, let's forget about it.

2085
01:48:17,237 --> 01:48:18,636
No! I want to know.

2086
01:48:20,173 --> 01:48:23,370
About size!
- About my...

2087
01:48:25,912 --> 01:48:26,970
What do you mean?

2088
01:48:27,180 --> 01:48:29,648
Actually, I was not
totally honest with Rishi.

2089
01:48:30,183 --> 01:48:31,912
Because I didn't want to hurt him.

2090
01:48:32,652 --> 01:48:34,449
I knew what I wanted but...

2091
01:48:35,655 --> 01:48:37,247
I just wanted to be free, you know.

2092
01:48:37,524 --> 01:48:43,190
I didn't want to live on
the sly and as a liar.

2093
01:48:45,065 --> 01:48:48,398
You know, I don't think there
is anything left between us.

2094
01:48:51,538 --> 01:48:53,335
I think we are good together.

2095
01:48:55,675 --> 01:48:57,074
Let's not talk about old things.

2096
01:48:58,678 --> 01:49:00,669
Rishi started to live
separately after a few days.

2097
01:49:01,481 --> 01:49:04,678
It's not like we had a big
fight or anything like that.

2098
01:49:04,951 --> 01:49:08,352
I mean it was... I guess you
can call it a joint decision.

2099
01:49:09,022 --> 01:49:10,080
And I loved Veer.

2100
01:49:25,572 --> 01:49:26,630
Hello!

2101
01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:28,098
Hi Mita!

2102
01:49:28,642 --> 01:49:29,700
Veer.

2103
01:49:30,444 --> 01:49:31,502
Mita!

2104
01:49:32,512 --> 01:49:35,447
I tried but I
can't live without you.

2105
01:49:35,982 --> 01:49:38,109
I can't take this
decision very often.

2106
01:49:38,318 --> 01:49:40,513
You can't take this
decision on your own.

2107
01:49:40,720 --> 01:49:42,187
I had to take this decision.

2108
01:49:42,589 --> 01:49:44,716
Actually I wanted to
take this decision.

2109
01:49:44,991 --> 01:49:46,049
Okay Mita!

2110
01:49:47,394 --> 01:49:49,589
Mita, let's meet for
dinner and discuss it.

2111
01:49:50,263 --> 01:49:52,458
No, I don't want to go
on a dinner with you.

2112
01:49:52,532 --> 01:49:54,727
Okay, coffee then. - Please
don't make it so difficult for me.

2113
01:49:55,135 --> 01:49:57,000
Mita!
- I'm sorry, I have to go.

2114
01:49:57,204 --> 01:50:00,037
Mita, listen. Mita!

2115
01:50:02,142 --> 01:50:05,202
'Stop worrying about Veer.
There's someone for him.'

2116
01:50:06,012 --> 01:50:07,070
Simi.

2117
01:50:07,614 --> 01:50:09,411
She'll look after him like a mother.

2118
01:50:09,749 --> 01:50:12,741
She'll cook for him,
make tea and talk to him.

2119
01:50:14,020 --> 01:50:15,487
She'll make him realize...

2120
01:50:15,555 --> 01:50:17,489
...that something very
bad has happened to him.

2121
01:50:18,758 --> 01:50:20,225
She won't let go
off this opportunity.

2122
01:50:21,628 --> 01:50:23,493
The poor guy is
ready to be her prey.

2123
01:50:24,097 --> 01:50:26,759
Listen, take it easy. Come
on have some food. Okay?

2124
01:50:27,100 --> 01:50:29,500
And don't worry.
I've done the shopping.

2125
01:50:29,769 --> 01:50:33,762
Eggs, broccolis, soy milk,
brown bread and everything else.

2126
01:50:34,441 --> 01:50:38,104
Okay? And yes, I've canceled
all your appointments at office.

2127
01:50:38,311 --> 01:50:39,369
All?

2128
01:50:40,447 --> 01:50:43,575
Did I do something wrong?
- No.

2129
01:50:44,384 --> 01:50:45,783
In this situation, you should relax.

2130
01:50:47,454 --> 01:50:48,512
Come, eat.

2131
01:50:48,655 --> 01:50:50,316
I was not able to
talk to Simi honestly.

2132
01:50:50,390 --> 01:50:51,448
What could I tell her?

2133
01:50:51,525 --> 01:50:53,254
That I was infatuated
by a 20 year old girl.

2134
01:50:53,527 --> 01:50:55,256
'Then why didn't you stop yourself? '

2135
01:50:55,662 --> 01:51:00,793
There was something
missing in our marriage.

2136
01:51:01,067 --> 01:51:02,125
'Raga? '

2137
01:51:02,402 --> 01:51:03,460
Raga!

2138
01:51:03,670 --> 01:51:05,797
Simi, stop being so understanding!

2139
01:51:06,139 --> 01:51:07,800
You said you were free on Sunday.

2140
01:51:08,074 --> 01:51:10,269
I want to be alone. Please can I?

2141
01:51:10,677 --> 01:51:12,201
Be alone. I'm not stopping you.

2142
01:51:12,279 --> 01:51:13,337
Yes, you are!

2143
01:51:13,480 --> 01:51:16,278
In your quiet,
supportive and understanding way.

2144
01:51:16,349 --> 01:51:17,407
That's you thing.

2145
01:51:17,484 --> 01:51:19,076
I still have some
feelings for Mita...

2146
01:51:19,152 --> 01:51:21,086
...which I can't have for you.

2147
01:51:21,821 --> 01:51:23,083
Fine!

2148
01:51:23,423 --> 01:51:26,119
Where are you going? Simi!

2149
01:51:26,693 --> 01:51:27,819
Simi, wait.

2150
01:51:28,094 --> 01:51:29,356
Simi, please!

2151
01:51:30,163 --> 01:51:31,221
I'm sorry, Simi.

2152
01:51:33,300 --> 01:51:35,825
You know, you're so mean.

2153
01:51:36,236 --> 01:51:38,363
I'm sorry, Simi. You
do mean a lot for me.

2154
01:51:38,438 --> 01:51:40,235
No! I know how you feel about me.

2155
01:51:40,507 --> 01:51:43,135
You're so self-centered.
I did so much for you... - I know.

2156
01:51:43,209 --> 01:51:46,110
But I didn't mean it.
- Then why did you say it?

2157
01:51:46,580 --> 01:51:49,174
I was confused but I
didn't want to hurt you.

2158
01:51:49,249 --> 01:51:50,307
I don't believe you.

2159
01:51:51,384 --> 01:51:53,579
Simi, please. I don't deserve you.

2160
01:51:53,653 --> 01:51:55,177
You don't deserve me!

2161
01:52:05,398 --> 01:52:07,730
'Ln two years a lot had changed.'

2162
01:52:08,201 --> 01:52:10,169
'Simi and Veer were married.'

2163
01:52:13,740 --> 01:52:14,866
Are you hungry?

2164
01:52:16,810 --> 01:52:17,868
You?

2165
01:52:19,613 --> 01:52:20,671
Not really.

2166
01:52:20,814 --> 01:52:23,339
There's reshmi kebab in
the freezer and also salad.

2167
01:52:23,817 --> 01:52:25,751
Yes, want some?

2168
01:52:25,885 --> 01:52:27,147
Lts okay, I'll have it later.

2169
01:52:27,754 --> 01:52:28,812
I'll get it.

2170
01:52:30,624 --> 01:52:32,683
I'll have some salad.

2171
01:52:32,892 --> 01:52:34,154
Salad?
- I'll take salad.

2172
01:52:34,628 --> 01:52:36,152
But I don't like carrots in salad.

2173
01:52:36,630 --> 01:52:39,155
Get the dressing. But the pulav
(rice) which is lying in the fridge...

2174
01:52:39,232 --> 01:52:42,292
...since yesterday... Why don't
you heat that and get it for me?

2175
01:52:42,569 --> 01:52:45,629
There should be some coke in
the freezer too. Get the coke.

2176
01:52:47,173 --> 01:52:49,573
Didn't I tell you about,
passively aggressive.

2177
01:52:50,443 --> 01:52:53,310
Somehow she gets what she wants.

2178
01:52:53,847 --> 01:52:55,576
Me first. Then Rishi.

2179
01:52:55,849 --> 01:52:56,907
The job at the magazine.

2180
01:52:57,317 --> 01:52:59,717
Separation from Rishi and now Veer.

2181
01:52:59,853 --> 01:53:01,582
What nonsense!
- What?

2182
01:53:01,721 --> 01:53:03,313
I chased Simi.

2183
01:53:03,790 --> 01:53:06,384
Only when Mita had
returned to Samit.

2184
01:53:08,862 --> 01:53:11,456
And I introduced him
to Mita. You know.

2185
01:53:11,865 --> 01:53:13,924
I see.
- Did I push? - Not really.

2186
01:53:16,269 --> 01:53:18,601
Look, I'm not in the race anymore.

2187
01:53:18,938 --> 01:53:20,929
I don't want to get
involved with anyone.

2188
01:53:21,207 --> 01:53:23,198
We're fine. We don't fight anymore.

2189
01:53:23,410 --> 01:53:27,403
And if we do fight then...
- She washes clean clothes again.

2190
01:53:27,881 --> 01:53:28,939
The black shirt.

2191
01:53:29,683 --> 01:53:31,617
We keep it near the washing machine.

2192
01:53:31,685 --> 01:53:32,947
God knows when we might get angry.

2193
01:53:33,420 --> 01:53:35,684
The black shirt looks
white after so much washing.

2194
01:53:39,826 --> 01:53:41,487
On the shelf, above the microwave...

2195
01:53:41,828 --> 01:53:43,625
...there are two bottles there.
Get those here.

2196
01:53:43,830 --> 01:53:47,425
Of course we're very happy. It's a...

2197
01:53:48,301 --> 01:53:50,496
You know, I think he
understands my stupid ways.

2198
01:53:50,637 --> 01:53:51,831
She's the more understanding.

2199
01:53:56,509 --> 01:53:58,841
Don't hurt anyone.
Don't hurt yourself.

2200
01:54:02,315 --> 01:54:03,646
'What do you have in your hands? '

2201
01:54:03,783 --> 01:54:05,512
I'm making a drape for her birthday.

2202
01:54:06,986 --> 01:54:09,511
But you said you were going
to make that thing. - Which?

2203
01:54:09,589 --> 01:54:11,454
The one you learned on TV.
- The pasta?

2204
01:54:11,791 --> 01:54:12,849
Yes!

2205
01:54:15,795 --> 01:54:17,262
Madhu!

2206
01:54:17,464 --> 01:54:20,991
She's a new student. She has
just joined this semester.

2207
01:54:21,935 --> 01:54:23,732
She's helping me on
script development.

2208
01:54:24,604 --> 01:54:25,798
Very bright girl.

2209
01:54:26,339 --> 01:54:28,273
'The things which
you don't discuss...

2210
01:54:28,341 --> 01:54:29,603
...how do you resolve those? '

2211
01:54:29,743 --> 01:54:30,869
Running around the bush...

2212
01:54:31,544 --> 01:54:33,011
'Like man-woman issues.'

2213
01:54:33,346 --> 01:54:34,404
Resolved!
- Resolved!

2214
01:54:34,614 --> 01:54:35,672
'How? '

2215
01:54:41,020 --> 01:54:43,011
We had such lovely times together.
- I know.

2216
01:54:45,558 --> 01:54:47,492
All right tell me.
- What?

2217
01:54:47,894 --> 01:54:49,020
Which is your favourite?

2218
01:54:51,965 --> 01:54:53,023
Tell me!

2219
01:54:55,635 --> 01:55:00,038
That one.
- Which one? Tell me.

2220
01:55:01,441 --> 01:55:02,908
You tell me.
- Me?

2221
01:55:02,976 --> 01:55:04,034
Yes.

2222
01:55:04,310 --> 01:55:05,436
Okay.

2223
01:55:06,913 --> 01:55:09,040
Our first kiss.
- Yes.

2224
01:55:09,315 --> 01:55:10,373
Isn't it?

2225
01:55:12,986 --> 01:55:14,044
Tell me when?

2226
01:55:14,988 --> 01:55:16,046
When?

2227
01:55:16,389 --> 01:55:17,447
Tell me the date.

2228
01:55:23,463 --> 01:55:25,795
Date!
- Yes.

2229
01:55:26,599 --> 01:55:28,533
But why should I tell it?

2230
01:55:29,869 --> 01:55:31,063
How can I forget it?

2231
01:55:31,604 --> 01:55:32,662
Are you testing me?

2232
01:55:33,406 --> 01:55:34,464
No.

2233
01:55:34,607 --> 01:55:35,665
No!

2234
01:55:36,009 --> 01:55:37,067
Okay, I'm sorry.

2235
01:55:38,411 --> 01:55:39,605
I'm sorry.

2236
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:44,746
You smell so sweet.
So sweet! So sweet!

2237
01:55:47,420 --> 01:55:48,819
Should we change the wall colour?

2238
01:55:49,756 --> 01:55:51,553
Colours...
- Yes, Samit?

2239
01:55:54,494 --> 01:55:55,552
Pink?

2240
01:55:56,029 --> 01:55:57,758
Shall we paint the walls pink?
- Paint it pink.

2241
01:55:59,032 --> 01:56:00,090
Yes, do it.

2242
01:56:01,968 --> 01:56:03,560
No, white.
- What.

2243
01:56:05,438 --> 01:56:06,496
White!

2244
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:08,098
White?

2245
01:56:08,441 --> 01:56:09,499
White.

2246
01:56:09,576 --> 01:56:10,634
I think white will look nice.

2247
01:56:14,113 --> 01:56:15,774
