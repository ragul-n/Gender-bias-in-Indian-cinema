1
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,700
This is an infinite field full of endless spaces.

2
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:59,580
Tremors that emerge from this ocean's belly
are reflected in the vast silences of the skies.

3
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,870
Souls that have been touched by this undisturbed

4
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,370
purity can never be cleaved apart by Time,
Distance, Circumstances or Catastrophes.

5
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:14,250
Because, all though these souls may seem separable,
Life beats within them as one.

6
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:46,950
The sages, saints and goddesses, birds and
creatures of the sea..all of them change with time.

7
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,110
None can stop the course of this change.

8
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:53,310
The why, as mortal humans, are we so stubborn?

9
00:01:53,930 --> 00:02:00,350
Why grieve about situations that were
both unforeseen or predictable?

10
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,290
In his childhood, there was a doll draped in a white gown.

11
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:10,450
It was precious to him.

12
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:16,660
One day, when I woke up in the morning,
he had lost his doll and was bawling.

13
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,620
I said, why are you crying so much?
I told him I will get you another one.

14
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,620
He was insistent about wanting his lost doll.

15
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,580
He ate and slept while in grief.

16
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:32,950
That was when I told him this age-old aphorism as a story.

17
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,450
He listened to me entirely and then said,
Grandma, grandma..

18
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,160
there are saints and mountains and everything in this story,

19
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,700
but you and I find no mention in it.

20
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,620
That is why, I want you to come help me look for my doll.

21
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:54,200
In such a young age, he has underlined that hope is good.

22
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,950
True! It is good!

23
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,830
It's been 80 days since he left home dad.

24
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,750
How do we live like this without knowing how he is?

25
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,950
Even if it is eight hundred days, I don't care.

26
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,870
Isn't that such a great love story of his?

27
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,660
What happened to it?

28
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:15,250
And it's been 82 days, not 80 since
I asked him to leave this house.

29
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,160
Let me tell you something and remember this..

30
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:22,660
Regardless of what you choose in life, as you go
deeper into it, you will only find nothingness.

31
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,200
And right now, your brother is
very close to that nothingness.

32
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,290
Start that bike.

33
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:33,910
Yes grandma.

34
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,330
Ey idiot! You've draped my nightie!

35
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:02,830
Take them off!

36
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:09,620
That is not necessary. Take those pants off.

37
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:18,750
Wait wait wait! It wont come off like that.
Let me take it off!

38
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,330
My fiance is at the door!

39
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,000
So please leave now!

40
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,370
Why is he singing a song?

41
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:36,790
I don't want to spoil his mood.

42
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,700
We're meeting for the first time, so please now.

43
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,500
Ey, stay quiet! This will get done in two minutes.

44
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,120
No! Listen, I don't want this now.

45
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,200
So please leave.

46
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,040
Its alright, that guy will wait.

47
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,500
Leave! I said, just leave now.

48
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:52,410
Take them off!

49
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,540
Take them off!

50
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,000
Take them off!

51
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,620
Take them off!

52
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:20,700
I will take you to Poona, on my Luna,
darling open the door.

53
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:21,200
Ple-

54
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,200
Yeah Noorin!
Hello sir, how are you?

55
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,120
Ah ok ok listen.

56
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,910
You said you missed my seminar right?

57
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:34,700
Do you want to come now? Shall I give you my address?

58
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,370
Yeah sir, I'll come to seminar hall.

59
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,120
Hey, not the seminar hall. Come over to my house.

60
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:41,000
Asshole.

61
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,540
Ey Shiva

62
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:46,250
Whats up?

63
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:53,080
When I came to your clinic, you remember there was a girl
who said I looked handsome and enquired after me?

64
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,000
Aah, Deepthi! Our family friend. Yes, I remember her.

65
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,330
If I call her, will she come to my flat?

66
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:03,160
Rey rey rey, don't do that, please. It'll seem very awful..
like I introduced her to you. Dont man.

67
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,870
Forget all that, will she come if I call her?

68
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,450
That girl has a boyfriend

69
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,700
and theirs is a very serious love story..
Try to understand this, please.

70
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,910
What did I ask you? Will she come? Or no?

71
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,330
Arrey! Are you mad or something?

72
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,910
You are turning into a lout with every
passing day, what is wrong with you?

73
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,160
She won't come! You won't forget Preethi
if you keep doing these things-

74
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:33,620
Auto!

75
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,950
Ey man! What did you do, piss in here?

76
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,200
My diaper overflowed

77
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,660
You wore a diaper?!

78
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,790
Did you forget about this before you came here?!

79
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,040
Preethi!

80
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:09,040
Preethi!

81
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,290
Ey Preethi! What are you eating?

82
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,080
Open your mouth.

83
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,370
Open your mouth idiot!

84
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,500
What are you eating? Eeks! Are you eating chicken?
Spit it. Out. Spit it out!

85
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,370
Dogs do eat chicken sir.

86
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:29,040
Dhaneshwari, I've told you this before
Don't call her a dog.

87
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,120
Sorry sir.

88
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,120
Are you being burdened because of Preethi?

89
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,040
I am cleaning up after her poop and everything right?

90
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,620
Yes sir.

91
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,580
Then what is your problem?

92
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,200
When have you started eating chicken, huh?

93
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,700
You never ate meat earlier, right?

94
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,700
Will she speak to you sir? That is a little too much sir.

95
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,330
I'm just wondering if she'd tell you sir.

96
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,540
Yes, she has. Go mind your business.

97
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,660
Ey! I will wipe that smile and laughter off your face!

98
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,160
Do you see Preethi? Do you see how they laugh at us?

99
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:04,910
Rani!

100
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,080
We have a 4-hour surgery today. Please be careful.

101
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:10,200
Don't get scolded.

102
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,370
Good morning sir.

103
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,410
Good morning sir.

104
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,660
This is a classic case of the angular malunion of the femur.

105
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,160
Uncle, I need you to listen as well. This is for you.

106
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:45,870
Just like the skin heals after a cut,
so too our bones as well.

107
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,540
Last time when you were fractured,

108
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,000
you sought your local doctor's help
and got a crepe bandage, isn't that right?

109
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:54,000
So what happened is that it healed,
but angularly..like this.

110
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,200
So it affects your functioning.

111
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:57,330
Which is why it pains.

112
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:02,330
So what we will do is break it,
cut the excess and fix it straight.

113
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,540
We will attach plates and screws and fix it.

114
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,200
The surgery is happening on my leg.

115
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,120
But they've shaved me completely down there.

116
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,250
There won't be any mistakes right, sir?

117
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,410
Has no one prepared the patient?

118
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:14,580
Yes sir.

119
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:19,330
We need to clean the surrounding area as well.
This is procedure.

120
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,330
Dont worry.

121
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,700
When you play cricket, they dont clean
and graze just the pitch right?

122
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,870
They graze the entire field.
Think about this in the same way. Ok?

123
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:27,500
Yes sir.

124
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,700
Durga, you told me about your fight with
the inlaws. Is that settled?

125
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,000
Yes sir.

126
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:49,870
Rani, go make bed number
18 ready for the Operation Theatre.

127
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,290
Sir, some astrologer said it's inauspicious today.

128
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,580
He said let's get the surgery done tomorrow.

129
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,910
Tomorrow is a Sunday. I'm cant come,

130
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:57,540
I have to take Preethi to the park.

131
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:58,540
Then how do we do this sir?

132
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,370
What do you mean how?

133
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:03,580
Go tell them the entire thigh has swollen up,
if they waste anymore time, his crotch will swell up as well.

134
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,040
And tell them the surgeon is a freak,
he will chop it off as well.

135
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,700
Rani, go check on the OT.

136
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,450
Ok.

137
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,160
Aah, what were you saying?

138
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,750
Sir, the MO asked not make an entry into the logbook.

139
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,620
Apparently, your patient count in the last two
months has been too high.

140
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,160
And if this gets into the log book again-
What is with this logbook problem, time and again?

141
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:24,290
Do what you want to do. Don't bring this to me.

142
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,290
Hmm..Ok sir.

143
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,540
Sorry boys.

144
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:53,870
Show me your wound.

145
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,040
Where else are you hurt?

146
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:00,000
Here.

147
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,580
Ey wait! Guard it with your hand!
If that drips in, your insides will burn.

148
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,370
You'll have to sit it out without your
underwear or stuff ice down there.

149
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,700
What kind of medicos you are!

150
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,410
You could have brought a first aid kit in your bag, right?

151
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,950
Huh? You think I would've dreamt about our
sir here arranging this massive feast for all of us?

152
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:22,580
Shiva, give me that cigarette.

153
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,080
Ajay!

154
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:39,450
Hit him and smash this bastard's face.

155
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,450
Is that so? Why don't you kick this freepass?

156
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,830
If you kick a goal, I'll strip naked and
walk around in Balmatta Circle! Come!

157
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,120
Come on Rajay, come on!

158
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,290
Arjun! Super!

159
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,450
Ey Reddy! Thoo!

160
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:20,200
You..

161
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:23,660
Come , come , come, come here.

162
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,250
Kamal Leave me..

163
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,540
Move..

164
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,950
Ey Kamal don't stop him.

165
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:32,660
Arjun Arjun! Please man!
Another three minutes and the trophy is ours!

166
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,450
He's instigating you.

167
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,160
Even the referee has been fixed.

168
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,750
Please understand. Ok?

169
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:40,870
Ok.

170
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,450
Come on boys!

171
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:02,790
Ey Amith!

172
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,580
Three minutes left for this match to finish.
This time too, the championship is held by St. Mary's!

173
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,080
Shiva..

174
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:22,410
Arjun! Look behind you!

175
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,250
Arjun!

176
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:06,080
Kamal! Close the gates for me this one time, please !

177
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,330
Please stop it yaar! Please!

178
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,870
Beat him up man, beat him up! Give him a couple more

179
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:36,160
Beat him beat him beat him,
beat his face, break his mandible.

180
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,330
Ey, you...

181
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,540
Just leave that there!

182
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:10,620
do you know who that guy is?
Karnataka State Football Convenor!

183
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,950
Why did he even leave that cup there
when you asked him to?

184
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:19,000
Because he knew it was ours anyway,
which is why he left it there.

185
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,250
Arjun Reddy! The Dean is calling you.

186
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:43,330
This is Doctor Arjun Reddy Deshmukh,
one of our house surgeons.

187
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,870
All of you must come across a person like this...

188
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:07,500
..But in managing his anger, he's a failure.

189
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,870
He is a classic example for all of you

190
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:20,200
In the medical profession, a person who can't handle
anger is equal to a murderer holding a surgical blade.

191
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,330
Disliking things, being angry, rush of blood, adrenaline..

192
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,120
All of these are natural for a person.

193
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:32,790
But only when you ignore them, when you control them,
you can be yourself when you treat a person.

194
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:37,870
If there is no compassion, these degrees are useless.

195
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:44,160
I can tolerate it if you score less in academics
but not if you can't control your anger.

196
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,620
Sir, there is a video of the entire match.

197
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,870
I could show it to you sir, if you want..

198
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,000
Ey, go away.

199
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:57,540
Please continue sir.

200
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:00,120
Im very disappointed with you Arjun.

201
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,120
Did you atleast think about the reputation of this college?

202
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,040
Write an apology to the Sports Board, immediately

203
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:08,700
And one to the college i.e; me.

204
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:12,330
I want to see two photocopies along with
your signature on the notice board.

205
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,200
And one month's suspension.

206
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,620
Or you may leave this college and go your way.

207
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,450
Football is a violent sport Sir.

208
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:23,500
Striking into the opponent's area with a goal
and then blocking him when he gets here.

209
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,160
that is the kind of football I know.

210
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:26,370
Are you teaching me about the sport?

211
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,200
No Sir. I'm only expressing my reservation.

212
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,160
There is self respect in this sport.

213
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,950
A war-like feel in that chaos.

214
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,910
And the reason for that feeling is our college.

215
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,500
I thought only about our college Sir. A lot.

216
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:40,080
Which is why I controlled my anger for a long time.

217
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,790
I have no regrets Sir.

218
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:44,410
This is how I am

219
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,160
I couldn't take it easy.

220
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,120
Because, if I did, it would've become a habit.

221
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,540
Not just in the field, but in life as well.

222
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:54,000
What habit have you formed now? Beating up people?

223
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:59,410
There was a bloody satisfaction in the fight.

224
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:03,620
And you and the fear of losing that
championship is nothing in comparison to it.

225
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:08,160
If I had passed time for three more minutes then,
there would have been a grand felicitation by now.

226
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:09,250
Right here.

227
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:13,830
I don't need that. Nor does my college.

228
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:21,830
I have no need to ask you to listen
to my version or watch that video.

229
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:23,120
And you don't have any intention to do so.

230
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,750
I will leave this college tomorrow at exactly this time.

231
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,040
You're going to leave this college?

232
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,580
What do you hope to achieve in life with all this anger?

233
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:38,000
You won't understand Sir.

234
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:40,410
You are the Dean of this college.

235
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,790
An employee doing his duty

236
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,290
And I am it's student. This is my college.

237
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:52,700
Song coming from FM Radio

238
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,040
What's up, has the raging class started yet?

239
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,540
Ey! Pink scarf!

240
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,080
Tea!

241
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:39,700
Listen up,

242
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,200
I have come to tell you something important.

243
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:47,790
Just so your professor won't understand,

244
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:52,330
I am speaking in Telugu without
a single word in English, so listen carefully.

245
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:57,330
A girl has enrolled in your first year's batch.

246
00:25:58,450 --> 00:25:59,700
I like that girl.

247
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:04,410
You are strictly forbidden from oiling
their hair or making them walk barefoot or..uhh..

248
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,830
Aah, yes. Or asking them personal details.

249
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,450
DO NOT DO any of these things.

250
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,700
That girl's name is..

251
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,330
She is decked in white clothes.
The upper garment is rose pink in color.

252
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:23,080
These are your clues. Understood? Is that understood?

253
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,250
Leaving aside that particular girl, the rest are all yours.

254
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:29,370
Don't be greedy,

255
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,700
as the classes keep progressing, new enrollments
will take place and you will have new opportunities.

256
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:39,200
Especially, for you boys..

257
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,750
See how he is intimidating us?

258
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:43,950
I am not intimidating you.
Wipe that stupidity off your faces

259
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,040
Your professor is watching.

260
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:48,330
Where are the girls of your class?

261
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,540
Apparently there is no water in their hostel wing.
They've skipped classes today.

262
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:53,370
Alright.

263
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,910
Pass this message onto them as well.

264
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,000
And to those who don't speak our language.

265
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:02,160
And the rest of the students in your academic batch.
I can't go around touring all your classes.

266
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,200
I do not want to face any difficulties in this..

267
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:05,750
Process.

268
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:06,660
Process.

269
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,290
In this process.

270
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:10,040
Alright?

271
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:37,410
You see that girl with the pink scarf? That's the one.

272
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,120
Isn't she very pretty?

273
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:39,750
Very.

274
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,540
I think that girl seems embarrassed.
Huh? You leave then.

275
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:47,290
Ey, where are you girls going?
Hey, move. Go away.

276
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,500
You see that girl with the pink scarf?

277
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,790
Hey little girl! Get up.

278
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,500
What is your name?

279
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,080
Preethi

280
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:58,120
Full name

281
00:27:58,370 --> 00:27:59,080
Preethi Shetty

282
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:00,790
Shetty? Mangalore?

283
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:02,910
Settled in Hyderabad,

284
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:04,830
but uhh..she's from Potthur.

285
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:05,870
Thirty kilometers from here.

286
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:09,830
What did she say her name was?

287
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:13,290
Hey you little one! Tell this Sir your name.

288
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:14,950
Preethi

289
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,750
You know our manager Manjunath right?

290
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,950
His cousin's daughter has joined your college apparently.

291
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,580
And you know your college is infamous
for ragging culture right?

292
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,040
He's very worried about her.

293
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,830
He's lingering around, insisting that
I speak to you about this.

294
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:35,950
I'll talk to her Dad

295
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,120
Dad! Find out what happened to his football match.

296
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,580
Your brother wants to know what happened to your match.

297
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,120
There was a small fight..

298
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:44,370
I mean, I beat them up a little..

299
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:46,080
Did you get suspended?

300
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:51,330
One month suspension. They are going to send
a formal letter of concern home, ignore it please.

301
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:52,870
Ok.

302
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,410
Everybody's gone to her class and made a big scene there

303
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,000
I think that girl complained to her father.

304
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,870
That man walked into the OPD and is creating
ruckus asking for Arjun Reddy.

305
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,120
So?

306
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:15,540
You're already suspended! Do you need this right now?

307
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:17,120
You should get beaten up for this Shiva

308
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,290
Is that him Kamal?

309
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:24,830
He hasn't seen you anyway. So don't react now.

310
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,830
That girl is also coming here man!

311
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:37,910
I am Arjun Reddy.

312
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,160
You are smoking, despite being a doctor?

313
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:48,790
690 carcinogenic agents,
4 cancer factors, 48 COPD diseases.

314
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:49,540
I know all this and I still smoke.

315
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:50,790
It's become a habit.

316
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:54,660
Does your dad know about this?

317
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:56,200
No.

318
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,000
But if he asks me I won't lie.

319
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,000
I am Devdas Shetty,

320
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:05,250
your father's manager Manjunath, he is my first cousin.

321
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,700
Ohh! Uncle! My dad called me and spoke about you.

322
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:09,750
Nice to meet you.
He asked me to take care of your daughter.

323
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:11,250
She's my daughter

324
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,500
Preethi.

325
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:13,370
Hi

326
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:19,830
Take care of her, like a brother would.

327
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:21,370
No no no, I can't be her brother!

328
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:24,500
I don't have any sisters and I don't even know
what that emotional connect is like.

329
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,040
I might take liberty and maybe even admonish
her if she doesn't score good grades.

330
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:34,580
Are you here on the Tulu quota?

331
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:36,290
She's a rank holder.

332
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,700
Are you here under the management quota?

333
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:39,910
No,

334
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,450
I stood 17th in KCET. 26th in EAMCET.

335
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,660
I like the oceans which is why I selected this college.

336
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:55,750
Lets go.

337
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:04,540
Hello, come in!

338
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,250
Everybody come in!

339
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,790
So, is everyone here?

340
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,000
Alright, take off your clothes.

341
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,750
I am talking to y'all! I said, take off your clothes!

342
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,330
Please..

343
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:23,910
This is how ragging at St.Mary's is!

344
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,080
We are Orthodox..

345
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:28,370
What did you say? Orthodox family is it?

346
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,660
Like in those films where they wrap a towel
around them and then take a shower?

347
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,250
I don't understand any of that but..take off your clothes.

348
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,080
The sooner you take them off,
the sooner you can put them back on.

349
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,410
Come come, get on with it, I don't have much time.

350
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,750
We are all girls no? I think we should.

351
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:42,620
You're so dead.

352
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:46,370
Hey you! Whats up with your stupid suggestions?

353
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,370
You're next in line now.

354
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:51,620
You can look at each other's faces later,
take your clothes off now.

355
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,410
Who is Preethi Shetty in here?

356
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,040
Is that you?

357
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,200
Ey, what's you problem, why are you interrupting us?

358
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,250
This girl is Arjun Sir's interest.

359
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,540
Apparently he told us so in our class today.

360
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:04,080
I am informing people in all the hostel wings.

361
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,290
Ok, I'm going to leave now..
Would you like to go around, instead of me?

362
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:11,450
Hey you, come here.

363
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,160
What is wrong with you? You should have called him
your cousin or boyfriend or something.

364
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:19,620
The North Indian girls are out playing antakshari.

365
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:20,910
You go join them.

366
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,200
Don't thank me. Thank him.

367
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:27,330
If you're ever in trouble again,
tell them about Arjun Sir. Ok?

368
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:31,910
You see how she's flocked her away?

369
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:35,450
Apparently, he was going to quit college.
But after he spotted this girl, he stayed back.

370
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:37,950
You think she's that pretty?

371
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,250
That remains to be seen.

372
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:45,120
Ey, why are you standing around.
Take off your clothes now!

373
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,950
Having met you

374
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:57,290
All that longing

375
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:01,080
in my heart is now fulfilled.

376
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:04,580
Oh my dearest
You who I have trusted.

377
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:09,910
You and me
Me and you
We are as one

378
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,790
together..

379
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:22,580
Will you look at that?

380
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:30,870
How does it feel like here on campus?

381
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:32,910
Its nice.

382
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,500
Is the mess food alright?

383
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:38,660
Its nice.

384
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,040
Is the hostel alright?

385
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:43,200
Its nice.

386
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:46,540
Good. You were playing antakshari is it?

387
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,410
Did your father..leave?

388
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:15,870
This is too much.

389
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,000
No one watched us

390
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:34,410
You can go. Go play antakshari

391
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:47,540
I just didn't expect this..That he'd
spot her in the morning and kiss her by evening.

392
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:08,660
What is it all happening, no idea
where is it slipping on the slant path?

393
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:19,620
What is it all going to happen,
which shore would I reach in the river like age?

394
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:35,160
Preethi this isn't like any normal academic degree.

395
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:36,830
This is MBBS.

396
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:40,160
You should be mentally fixed the moment
you join this college.

397
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:41,950
That we are going to be doctors.

398
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:45,120
Huh? What are you doing, sitting there?

399
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,120
Alright?

400
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,910
Fat chicks..

401
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:10,500
they're warm.

402
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:12,040
And always loyal.

403
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:15,620
Normally, two girls can't be friends together.

404
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:17,450
But have you ever noticed this?

405
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,540
A beautiful girl and a fat girl.

406
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:30,370
What's your name?

407
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,200
Shruthi.

408
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:34,410
Sruthi - Preethi.

409
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:35,540
Preethi - Shruthi.

410
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,370
Be friends now.

411
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:41,290
I will also speak to your hostel admin,
so you two can be roommates.

412
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:49,750
What class do you have today?

413
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,870
Anotomy

414
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:53,330
What is the topic?

415
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,540
Hand.

416
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,620
Come with me.

417
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:58,450
Since Im preparing for my Master's degree,

418
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,410
if I tutor you, I will finish my preparation as well.

419
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:12,830
Do you at least know?

420
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:18,580
Do I at least know?

421
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:23,500
Will the steps still stop?

422
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:28,700
Let us go whatever may happen.

423
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:33,450
The moment you stand before,

424
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:39,080
did I forget every minute I grew?

425
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:44,620
Did I open up the doors of first class?

426
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:49,080
Is this true?

427
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:21,250
How did so many change
in my fate in a day after you came?

428
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:32,830
Hope even that sky does not fit as
my letter to write them all

429
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,410
What is today's topic?

430
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:40,750
What happend?

431
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:42,790
Topic is..

432
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:44,950
Upper thorax.

433
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:08,040
I will say them all to you,
I will daily say even if it is a night

434
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:18,290
Will the stories still come to an end,
shall I come again in the dream?

435
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:28,620
The moment you stand before,
did I forget every minute I grew?

436
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:34,290
Did I open up the doors of first class?

437
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:38,370
Is this true?

438
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,580
Why don't you call once more?

439
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,200
What is wrong with you? No patience at all!

440
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:28,370
Youve been like this since birth!
Can't you hold your piss for sometime?!

441
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:31,750
I called her already, that lazy slob,
she's not answering!

442
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:33,660
Why don't you try just once? Maybe she'd answer.

443
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:36,870
I called Vidya herself. She hasn't answered.

444
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:42,080
Why isn't she answering-

445
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,500
Do you know what it feels like to be your friend?

446
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:45,870
Like pissing all over myself.

447
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:48,540
It might seem disgusting to those around me..

448
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,870
but only I know the warmth it brings.

449
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:55,370
They will come here no? In 5 or 10 minutes?

450
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:59,580
I have, under your name,
instructed all the first years in the hostel.

451
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:01,910
That you should be the first one to pour color on Preethi.

452
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:05,000
I wanted to surprise you but you're a hyperventilating candidate.

453
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,370
Why are you telling him these things?

454
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,700
What do you want me to do? He is irritating me to no end.

455
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:11,200
What happened to you there?
Just a bruise.

456
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,000
I'm sure she threw this guy against the wall.

457
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,700
You shut up, it wasn't the wall, it was the door.

458
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:21,290
I just came from the girls' hostel
and I saw Preethi in the office.

459
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:25,290
No one's even wishing her a Happy Holi.

460
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,700
Everyone's been warned properly.

461
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,580
Everything is clear and in place. Ok?

462
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,540
I think I'll go there.

463
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,410
Fine. Go do what you want.

464
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:36,500
I'll go.
Your wish.

465
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:38,000
Go. Leave.

466
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:39,910
Look, Kalyan Sir is here.

467
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,450
HI..Kalyan sir.

468
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,660
Hi..hello Kalyan sir.

469
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:45,450
Arjun

470
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:48,080
Hey..Kamal.
Kalyan sir.

471
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,120
After so many days! Whats happening?

472
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:53,000
How are you man?

473
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:53,620
Kalyan Sir!

474
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:54,830
After so many days

475
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:55,660
Happy Holi sir.

476
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:56,580
HI Keerthy.

477
00:41:57,410 --> 00:41:58,200
After so many days!

478
00:41:58,330 --> 00:41:59,450
Whats happening?

479
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:07,080
So whats up man? This bloody
Dean is screwing up my case man.

480
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:07,790
Wantedly.

481
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:10,910
That girl Spoorthi is somewhere in Bangalore.

482
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:13,370
I'm not in touch with her. What's up?

483
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:16,660
How many more months in Housie do you have?

484
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:18,160
One minute sir.

485
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,200
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING YOU IDIOT

486
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,200
WHO IS THAT GUY?

487
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,330
WHO IS THAT GUY?

488
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:28,160
What Happend?

489
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:29,620
Ey...who? wait there.

490
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,500
Who cries about these things?

491
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:33,910
Go take a shower, go.

492
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:44,160
Ey, come here.

493
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:49,450
What were you doing when some students
from another college came into this campus?

494
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:53,620
Sir..there were 6 of them and they asked..

495
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:54,910
Tell me exactly what happened?

496
00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:57,160
Sir you remember the fight in the football ground?

497
00:43:57,870 --> 00:43:58,660
6 of them came here.

498
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:02,750
Asked for Arjun Reddy's girlfriend.
When they identified her, they rubbed color all over her.

499
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:05,000
Tell me how and where on her body did they do it?

500
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:09,080
Sir..all over her chest..and..her hip.

501
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:12,040
Sir there were 6 of them but only one guy did it.

502
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:14,120
He has a sallow face.

503
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:16,790
We were helpless because we're outnumbered.

504
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:25,790
No one should be discussing this on campus.

505
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:27,200
I just don't like it.

506
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:49,330
Amar! Come out you Idiot!

507
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:30,660
Touch her!

508
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,750
Touch her now and see!

509
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,870
I will chop you up!

510
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:37,160
I will chop you up!

511
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:42,870
Please! He will die if you beat him up anymore.

512
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:44,660
Please Arjun.

513
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:55,160
You didn't notice Preethi's clothes have you?

514
00:45:57,370 --> 00:45:59,250
All the places they rubbed color on..

515
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:03,790
IF I BARGE INTO YOUR HOUSE AND COLOR
YOUR MOTHER AND SISTERS,

516
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:05,950
WILL THAT BE ALRIGHT?

517
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,750
If this is the situation when we are here,

518
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:19,000
who is going to take care of her after 6 months?

519
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,200
Who will guarantee that this won't happen again?

520
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:24,080
This guy should give me a guarantee.

521
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:25,580
Ey Amith! Tell me!

522
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:27,790
Tell me this won't happen again!

523
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:29,450
TELL ME YOU...

524
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:33,200
TELL ME NO ONE IS EVER GOING TO
GO UP TO HER AGAIN, YOU IDIOT!

525
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,410
He will die if you beat him up anymore.

526
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,620
Someone give me a cigarette you...!

527
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:42,250
Let go of me, I won't hit him, let go!

528
00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:50,040
Give us a lighter.

529
00:46:57,290 --> 00:47:01,750
Listen up Amith, I like that girl very very much.

530
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:05,830
We live in a physical growing world.

531
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,910
Growing up here, I learnt one thing..

532
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:16,660
if we are affected in any way, if we die,
there will be one single person who is most affected

533
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:19,040
And in my life, it is this girl.

534
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:23,160
If something happens to that girl,
I will be most affected, understand ?

535
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:26,910
Amith,

536
00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:29,410
what you've done is very very wrong.

537
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:31,500
Give me your word..

538
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:48,580
Give me your word.. I have very little patience right now..

539
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:00,830
I promise you.

540
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,080
This will never happen again.

541
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:06,910
FUCK OFF YOU BAST**RD!

542
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:47,250
Arjun!

543
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:49,330
Preethi!

544
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:51,700
Arjun!

545
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:57,700
I think this guy's gone to a park, let's also go there.

546
00:48:57,750 --> 00:48:58,200
Let's go.

547
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:01,200
Brother, your friend Arjun got drunk
and passed out near the lift.

548
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:04,200
And yesterday, he slept on the terrace with my mother's nightie.

549
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:06,330
Hahaha, are you serious? So funny!

550
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:07,620
Ey! What do you mean, “your mother's nightie?”

551
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:10,370
My mother's nightie! If this goes on, the
building's management will kick him out.

552
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:12,700
Ey, you get out first, I'll be the
first one to kick you out. Get out!

553
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:17,540
Arjun! Come here!
Come here man!

554
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:23,750
Arjun, meet my brother-in-law to be.
A physician from London.

555
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,080
And this is Arjun.

556
00:49:25,410 --> 00:49:28,750
My best friend and a college topper
during our days there.

557
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:32,330
Today was auspicious so our families met
with a wedding proposal for my sister.

558
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:33,790
The engagement's slated for next week.

559
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:47,580
Let me tell you something.

560
00:49:48,450 --> 00:49:52,910
If you shave the hair off my hands and drape me in a saree,
I will look sexier than those airhostesses.

561
00:49:56,290 --> 00:49:56,830
Isnt it?

562
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:04,250
Shiva! Do you think this guy is necessary for Divya?

563
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:08,000
See how badly he objectifies women.

564
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:10,120
Think about it man..

565
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:13,250
Eyy. What is this filthy language
that you think I have spoken?

566
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:14,830
Do you want me to speak to your dad?

567
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:20,950
Ask your sister seriously if she liked
this guy or if she was pressured into it.

568
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:24,120
What are you thinking about?

569
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:27,080
I accept that we swear most of the time,

570
00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:31,580
but we don't objectify women with such cheap behaviour
or make generalised comments about them.

571
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:37,120
Ey hello! You think you can be in a live-in relationship
and tell me how I should speak to women?

572
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:39,790
Ey hello, Preethi is his pup.

573
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:42,450
His was just a proposal that got accepted.

574
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:46,330
People like him deserve to be abandoned
if the marriage falls through also..

575
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,120
We are being absolutely right here.

576
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:49,120
who do you think you are?

577
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:52,660
You know who I am? You know who my father is?
Do you know how much PR I have?

578
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:56,250
He thinks airhostesses must live up to his
standards of beauty. What a cheap mentality.

579
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,160
So please leave.

580
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,040
Think about it Shiva.

581
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,290
Boss, this is too much.

582
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:04,620
My mother kept telling me to keep
away from Telangana people.

583
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,370
You're from Hyderabad yourself aren't you, you bugger.

584
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,830
Up until now I've been your brotherinlaw
and now I'm a bugger huh?

585
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,370
Say one more word and..

586
00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:12,870
Tell him.

587
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:13,580
You tell him.

588
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:16,040
Get out

589
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:17,040
Go

590
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:20,620
Fight? What fight Maa?

591
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,410
If you keep harping on about wedding proposals
from London, this is the kind we'd get.

592
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:26,540
What a useless guy, such loose talk.

593
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:30,950
Ey..anyways, I'm at my clinic now, I'll talk to you later.

594
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:39,000
Are you writing your thesis
while you're in this mood of yours?

595
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:40,910
This is when your brain is at its sharpest.

596
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:44,870
Why did you place those fish in glass bottles like that?

597
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:47,580
Next door neighbour Peter left them with me.

598
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:52,700
They keep banging against that glass aquarium all night.

599
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,700
They're very happy during the night.

600
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:58,330
That's why I separated them.

601
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:03,040
Do you realise that you're growing
more psychotic by the day?Do you?

602
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:11,370
You bloody..

603
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:15,370
Eyy, ey, where are you going?

604
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:17,290
Stop!

605
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:22,040
Stop,

606
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:25,120
Stop, you lunatic!

607
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:33,040
Are you mad or what? Why are running behind her?

608
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:46,830
You think I scared her?
Does she even seem scared?

609
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:49,660
She broke 10 glasses so far, my golden drop glasses.

610
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,450
You lunatic, were you going to hit her!

611
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:55,000
She's got a big background in this city man!

612
00:52:55,870 --> 00:52:58,790
How many times do I have to tell her? Smack her
a couple of times, that's when she will understand.

613
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:04,000
What happened?

614
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:14,330
Sutures? For her?

615
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:16,410
What do you think her age is?

616
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:18,040
19.

617
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:21,000
do you think anyone administers sutures to a 19 year old?
It will self-heal.

618
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:23,450
What were you people doing? Couldn't you advise her?

619
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:25,200
We just got here man.

620
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:28,540
Your hands are itching to get into surgery
the minute you finish MBBS eh?

621
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,080
Is she a guinea pig?

622
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:33,540
Did she even study and pass MBBS?

623
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:34,830
Get up!

624
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:41,870
She got cut quite deeply. Bled quite a lot.

625
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,910
Basic first aid is enough to heal this.

626
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:47,200
It will pain a little, just bear with it.

627
00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:49,660
Shiva, get a tetanus shot ready.

628
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,410
Where are you roaming around
without your slippers on, huh?

629
00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:00,200
Shiva, get a wheelchair.

630
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:00,790
Why?

631
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,540
We'll shift Preethi to the beach house.

632
00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:08,040
I mean..that cut is quite deep.
It'll be very difficult for her to move around.

633
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:10,330
Poor girl, she's a kid..
Ah! Kid huh?

634
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:13,160
Internal exam are coming up. How will she even study?

635
00:54:13,370 --> 00:54:16,500
I am suspended from college..
and I am her local guardian anyway..

636
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:18,580
Even her father insisted that
I take care of her the other day..

637
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,750
Her father asked you to take care of her
like she's your sister.

638
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:23,950
Not draw diagrams on her body and teach her medicine.

639
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:25,540
Just go get a wheelchair man. Please.

640
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:27,160
Where are you going?
To the girl's hostel.

641
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:28,040
Why?

642
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,660
How did beer bottles get into the junior's hostel?

643
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:37,790
Have you all been drinking beer?

644
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:38,620
No..no sir.

645
00:54:38,830 --> 00:54:40,540
Preethi's foot got cut with a beer bottle's shard.

646
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,790
Go pack Preethi's clothes in a bag.

647
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,000
Your warden isn't here.

648
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:51,040
If she comes around, tell her Preethi's gone
to her local guardian's house.

649
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:51,700
Okay sir.

650
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:56,620
Are all the underwear and nightdresses in the bag?

651
00:54:56,830 --> 00:54:57,790
They're out on the clothesline sir.

652
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:01,830
What else?

653
00:55:02,290 --> 00:55:03,040
That one over there.

654
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:24,500
This moment is sweet oh my dear, this moment is sweet

655
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:38,290
The sight is sweet oh my dear, the sight is sweet

656
00:56:40,370 --> 00:56:52,040
The feel is sweet, the pamper is sweet

657
00:56:54,160 --> 00:57:06,040
The getting along is sweet, the sensitivity is sweet

658
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:17,330
The age is into trance with a sweet wind blowing

659
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:58,700
Guys don't come in. Preethi is in there.

660
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:01,870
Don't go that way either, her clothes are out to dry.

661
00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:03,120
Don't you you want to go out somewhere?

662
00:58:03,830 --> 00:58:05,040
A cinema? Do you need some money?

663
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:16,200
Time stopped running and is seeing the beauties

664
00:58:16,370 --> 00:58:22,540
The enlightening in trance is inhaling the fragrances

665
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:29,700
The wants have overwhelmed the teasing tastes

666
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:36,200
The heat of breathe enhanced the thirst

667
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:46,450
Life is become happy drenched in
the sweet showers silently

668
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:57,500
This moment is sweet oh my dear, this moment is sweet

669
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:33,250
Preethi?

670
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:36,290
Isn't this your toothbrush?

671
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:49,330
What are you looking at?

672
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:51,410
Listen, I understand that this girl is going to live here.

673
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:54,700
But if you're going to ask us to go to a park or
a cinema everyday, that won't do. Understand?

674
00:59:54,790 --> 00:59:58,000
Is it? Then you and Kamal can shift to the campus.

675
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:01,830
Dont act smart. We're paying rent here, as well.

676
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:04,120
Okay

677
01:00:07,830 --> 01:00:08,620
What happened Preethi?

678
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,120
To day is my Birthday.

679
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:17,120
The blowing winds have murmured

680
01:00:17,790 --> 01:00:23,910
The visible smiles have made promises

681
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:30,830
Sky came down at the doorsteps of owned happiness

682
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:37,580
It is seen completely in the sea becoming into half

683
01:00:38,330 --> 01:00:47,160
The shore like a knotted thread drove
away the pain in heart

684
01:00:48,540 --> 01:01:00,200
This moment is sweet oh my dear, this moment is sweet

685
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:12,950
The sight is sweet oh my dear, the sight is sweet

686
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:27,450
The feel is sweet, the pamper is sweet

687
01:01:29,830 --> 01:01:41,250
The getting along is sweet, the sensitivity is sweet

688
01:01:43,410 --> 01:01:53,250
The age is into trance with a sweet wind blowing

689
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:24,620
Piggy!

690
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:36,500
Preethi! Your exams are finished right?
Aren't you going home?

691
01:02:38,450 --> 01:02:40,330
We're leaving on the day after tomorrow.
Don't you want to start packing?

692
01:02:40,950 --> 01:02:41,700
I'll do it tomorrow.

693
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,870
Arjun, can I stay here for two more days?

694
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:51,250
Baby please. I can't do goodbyes.

695
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:54,870
If you are here in Mangalore,
I won't be able to leave this town.

696
01:02:56,330 --> 01:02:57,250
Please go tomorrow.

697
01:03:00,950 --> 01:03:04,500
You leave for Mussorie. I'll leave for Hyderabad.

698
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:07,160
On the same day. Please Arjun.

699
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:10,750
Please?

700
01:03:14,330 --> 01:03:15,500
You're not trying to understand.

701
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:17,870
Didn't we discuss this already?

702
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:20,700
Our tickets are all booked. What is this discussion now?

703
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,200
Did you pack your luggage?

704
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:40,410
This beachhouse, our pastimes,

705
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:43,040
final year housie,

706
01:03:43,830 --> 01:03:45,370
Mangalore's St.Mary's life,

707
01:03:46,330 --> 01:03:48,160
Kori Roti..All of this has come to an end now.

708
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:52,870
What has come to an end?
You make it seem like a funeral.

709
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:53,790
What has come to an end?

710
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:57,870
That fellow's going to UK, I am going to
Mussoorie and you will start a clinic in Moula Ali.

711
01:03:59,410 --> 01:04:03,750
See how life will turn out three years later.
Always bugging people with nonsense nostalgia..

712
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:10,120
Arjun, try not to get angry.

713
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:12,120
Can I stay here for another 2 days?

714
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:16,450
Please? Please Arjun?

715
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:18,870
Kamal,

716
01:04:22,450 --> 01:04:24,580
let's kiss tonight.

717
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:31,950
Did I ever call you Kamal?

718
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:36,040
Climb your first footstep
Go crash into that mountain

719
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:38,950
And kiss her hard
You are the Lord!

720
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,540
Shiva, stop it. Let the kiss,
you don't have anyone to do it with anyway!

721
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:42,370
O Kamal, my dearest! I cannot believe my eyes.

722
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:46,330
May this Piggy be liberated from this world..

723
01:04:48,950 --> 01:04:49,910
Arjun!

724
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:05,370
Baby listen!

725
01:05:05,950 --> 01:05:07,370
Arjun, I'll stay for another two-

726
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:10,200
Why are you constantly targeting my weak point?

727
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:12,620
I told you that I can't leave this town if you are here.

728
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:16,540
Youve been bugging me about this
since 2 days now. Am I going to die?

729
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:27,790
Baby! What happened baby!
Who even cries about things like these?

730
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:31,000
Baby! are you crying?

731
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:35,040
Look here,

732
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:12,830
Distance is getting closer,

733
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:19,040
it grew the fond more

734
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:31,830
Hurry to meet again and again is driving even the time

735
01:06:32,910 --> 01:06:37,330
Both the sides have become one silently,
our places cannot separate us now

736
01:06:37,370 --> 01:06:41,660
Have you gone mad Preethi? How did you even get here?

737
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:42,700
Flight

738
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:46,330
Look at that,

739
01:06:48,950 --> 01:06:49,830
it's turned red.

740
01:06:54,370 --> 01:06:58,870
Baby, not even 15 days have passed since we moved away.

741
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:01,370
I feel like it's been 15 years.

742
01:07:01,950 --> 01:07:06,870
Come becoming the Hug....

743
01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:13,000
Hug becoming the breathe....

744
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,910
Come becoming the Hug....

745
01:07:19,620 --> 01:07:25,040
Hug becoming the breathe....

746
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:32,160
Life is widening the wings,

747
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:44,750
it comes flying for you to sleep landing on you

748
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:51,500
It is defeating even the sky

749
01:07:52,410 --> 01:07:58,500
When you are coming to me and me coming to you

750
01:07:58,870 --> 01:08:05,040
This nation and this world have become tinier

751
01:08:58,370 --> 01:09:05,910
Chants..

752
01:09:38,250 --> 01:09:41,370
Is this your house? It is very nice.

753
01:09:42,450 --> 01:09:43,330
Come inside

754
01:09:57,450 --> 01:09:59,450
Arjun, this is my younger brother Mithun.

755
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:00,790
Mithun Shetty.

756
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:01,830
Arjun.

757
01:10:02,330 --> 01:10:04,500
Arjun? Arjun what?
Mithun behave..

758
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:13,700
Amma, Arjun.

759
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:16,160
Arjun this is my mother. My elder sister.

760
01:10:17,910 --> 01:10:23,410
Aunty, I need to speak to you
and Uncle about something. Isn't he home?

761
01:10:26,910 --> 01:10:29,870
Aunty in the meanwhile, can I take Preethi home?

762
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:33,200
It's my brother's wedding the day after tomorrow,

763
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:34,910
We will be back in an hour.

764
01:11:12,910 --> 01:11:13,450
Preethi!

765
01:11:16,870 --> 01:11:18,200
Baby you don't scare..

766
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:19,290
I will talk..

767
01:11:21,330 --> 01:11:24,040
Uncle, I came here to talk about this.

768
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:29,200
Just because our relationship hasn't been
officiated yet, don't give that cheap look.

769
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:29,750
Please

770
01:11:31,410 --> 01:11:35,290
If I was your son in law,
you would have left quietly wouldn't you?

771
01:11:36,370 --> 01:11:36,950
Daddy!

772
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:39,660
Daddy!

773
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,950
Uncle, let's sit down and talk. Listen to me.

774
01:11:43,790 --> 01:11:46,950
Right from the day I saw you in college,
I knew you were maniac?

775
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:52,080
How dare you come here to my house? You cheap rascal!

776
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:55,830
Don't ever dare come here again!

777
01:12:04,910 --> 01:12:06,700
Preethi, do you want me to talk to him or should I leave?

778
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:14,700
Baby, he's seeing this in a very wrong perspective.

779
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:17,080
Sit him down and explain things clearly.

780
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:32,950
Is that him?

781
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:36,750
What business do you have on Preethi's terrace?

782
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:39,790
Ey, come here you.

783
01:12:41,370 --> 01:12:42,250
Why are you looking there?

784
01:12:45,790 --> 01:12:47,410
You! Come here!

785
01:12:48,750 --> 01:12:49,330
Come.

786
01:12:59,990 --> 01:13:01,280
You are my brother in law.

787
01:13:02,950 --> 01:13:06,950
I love your sister, do you understand?

788
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:18,900
Your features are exactly like your sister's.

789
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:22,780
What grade are you in?

790
01:13:24,860 --> 01:13:25,780
Inter 2nd year.

791
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:32,530
Leave all this and study well. Do you understand? Ok?

792
01:13:36,070 --> 01:13:37,320
What story did you tell these people to bring them here?

793
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:38,570
Told them I'd throw them a party.

794
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:51,570
Here, take this. Go party now.

795
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:59,110
And, tell your father that I kissed you as well.

796
01:14:05,730 --> 01:14:06,440
What happened there?

797
01:14:08,770 --> 01:14:11,730
Daddy, I've not yet told you but..

798
01:14:11,810 --> 01:14:14,230
No.. Just tell me what happened there?

799
01:14:14,730 --> 01:14:17,730
There is this girl called Preethi and I really love her.

800
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:19,810
I had not seen her in 6 months

801
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:22,100
So I went to her house and on her terrace,

802
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:25,350
we both were in a private space and
suddenly her dad came in from this side and..

803
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:27,520
he misunderstood the situation and..

804
01:14:28,190 --> 01:14:30,190
Just tell me..What is this about?

805
01:14:30,690 --> 01:14:32,480
Just tell me what happened?!

806
01:14:32,650 --> 01:14:33,350
That is ..

807
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:35,400
We are meet after 6 months

808
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:37,850
What is this about?

809
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:42,480
No dad, we were in a private space and
suddenly her father comes in from this corner and

810
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:46,600
What is all this? Private space?

811
01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:48,310
Ey Goutham, tell him what private space means.

812
01:14:51,650 --> 01:14:53,060
Daddy, what was your age when you got married?

813
01:14:53,940 --> 01:14:55,690
My age?
Yrs, what was your age when you got married?

814
01:14:55,810 --> 01:14:56,690
What has my age got to do here?

815
01:14:57,060 --> 01:14:58,270
Why my age?
You say dad.

816
01:14:58,900 --> 01:14:59,650
Ey Goutham, hang on.

817
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:01,150
Daddy, when you got married, what was your age?

818
01:15:01,190 --> 01:15:01,730
23.

819
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:03,400
But how is it relevant here?
Now tell me what my age is.

820
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:05,350
No, just tell me what my age is.
Ey Goutham, what is my age?

821
01:15:05,650 --> 01:15:07,190
What is this? Why is he talking about age?

822
01:15:07,980 --> 01:15:09,520
No, what is my age. You asked me didnt you?

823
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:10,600
27. Your age is 27 isnt it?

824
01:15:10,650 --> 01:15:11,100
So please leave.

825
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:21,650
Dad, you get inside I'll go talk to him. You go inside.

826
01:15:21,690 --> 01:15:23,230
What is this? What is he talking about?

827
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:27,060
Arjun,

828
01:15:29,770 --> 01:15:30,480
get up. Sit up.

829
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:42,520
Listen, if you want to get married now, tell your father,
“ Dad I want to get married now.

830
01:15:43,230 --> 01:15:46,230
Isn't it improper to ask your father about his
age when he got married?

831
01:15:46,730 --> 01:15:48,850
When I told him Preethi and I were in a private space,

832
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:51,440
he dismissed my explanation but kept
interrogating me about what happened there.

833
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:52,480
What do I tell him then Grandma?

834
01:15:53,270 --> 01:15:54,150
He doesn't understand!

835
01:15:54,230 --> 01:15:56,190
What do you expect him to understand?

836
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:01,350
When you were in college,
love is a space between her and yourself.

837
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:05,060
But if it turns into marriage, there are
a dozen concerned people on both sides,

838
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:11,810
with a lot of people butting in and making
judgements about what you should or shouldn't do.

839
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:15,650
But then, no matter how many people turn up,
you should always be steady.

840
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:16,730
Unshakeable.

841
01:16:17,310 --> 01:16:18,560
That is a relationship

842
01:16:18,980 --> 01:16:21,850
Because you and Grandpa were from the same caste,
it worked out easily for you.

843
01:16:22,650 --> 01:16:26,150
Ah, nothing of that sort. Nothing happened so easily.

844
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:29,520
My mother and aunt both called me a lot of names.

845
01:16:30,230 --> 01:16:34,100
“ Look at her. We sent her to Delhi to study
and she has ruined our reputation.”

846
01:16:35,020 --> 01:16:37,100
This is all common, happens everywhere.

847
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:46,900
If they said, no matter what you do, we won't agree
to this, then what would you have done?

848
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:47,690
I would have convinced them!

849
01:16:47,940 --> 01:16:50,770
What if they said we'd never agree, that there's no chance
for agreement, then what would have done?

850
01:16:50,850 --> 01:16:52,350
I would have still convinced them.

851
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:57,350
Grandma, Preethi's father is an ignorant fool.

852
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:01,150
If he seems like an ignorant fool to you,
he is still her father.

853
01:17:01,270 --> 01:17:02,770
First, I think you should lower your anger.

854
01:17:10,310 --> 01:17:11,150
Grandma...Preethi

855
01:17:12,270 --> 01:17:13,270
Hello..Grand Maa.

856
01:17:14,850 --> 01:17:16,060
Come inside, come.

857
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:20,560
Sit.

858
01:17:25,150 --> 01:17:26,060
Good.

859
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:30,230
You don't worry

860
01:17:31,270 --> 01:17:33,940
You will be strong, beautiful and happy together.

861
01:17:34,310 --> 01:17:34,810
Okay.

862
01:17:35,980 --> 01:17:36,730
Do you believe me?

863
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:39,810
Tell me!

864
01:17:41,270 --> 01:17:43,310
Daddy, he likes that girl very much.

865
01:17:44,690 --> 01:17:47,100
The matter might get more complicated.
Let's go talk to their family.

866
01:17:47,350 --> 01:17:48,020
What will you do?

867
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:51,770
Your wedding is in two days.
You think you can go talk to them now?

868
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:57,980
He has that clarity. That girl is also very clear about it.

869
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:00,270
Let her family come down and talk to us.

870
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:02,810
Dad, where is the foolery in any of this?

871
01:18:07,150 --> 01:18:10,150
Arjun, is this your house?

872
01:18:10,190 --> 01:18:11,480
Did you talk to your dad about us?

873
01:18:11,650 --> 01:18:12,440
No.

874
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:13,310
Good. Don't talk to him.

875
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:15,900
Listen, I will talk to him about us
It's unnecessary. Leave it.

876
01:18:26,650 --> 01:18:28,400
Did you kiss my brother?

877
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:29,350
Yes I did.

878
01:18:30,980 --> 01:18:35,020
I will kiss your dad as well. Your mother and sister as well.

879
01:18:43,310 --> 01:18:45,310
I don't understand why you're laughing right now.

880
01:18:56,060 --> 01:18:58,600
Baby, our first night is going to be here right?

881
01:18:58,690 --> 01:18:59,350
FIrst night?

882
01:19:00,310 --> 01:19:02,060
549th night.

883
01:19:09,850 --> 01:19:10,730
Just for fun..

884
01:19:13,150 --> 01:19:15,980
Then..how would you say correctly 549 times

885
01:19:21,310 --> 01:19:24,060
How did you know that 549 is the correct number

886
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:41,770
Here? Now?

887
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:44,100
Yeah! Nothing will happen.

888
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:00,730
Stay there. Dont come inside.

889
01:20:03,890 --> 01:20:07,600
Uncle, I'm sorry about what happened yesterday.

890
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:12,140
But please don't judge us about that incident.

891
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:15,100
I like Preethi very much.

892
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:17,350
I will take care of her very well.

893
01:20:18,850 --> 01:20:23,890
Ive also finished my M.S, no matter where I work,
I will be paid a minimum of 2 lakh rupees per month.

894
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:29,270
I think, if both our families could meet once,
you too could gain some confidence about this issue.

895
01:20:29,770 --> 01:20:32,480
I know you come from a very privileged
family and background.

896
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:35,690
Uncle, that is not my intention.

897
01:20:36,940 --> 01:20:40,560
I knew you'd use your status to reason with me.

898
01:20:40,810 --> 01:20:43,270
Uncle, I understand that all of this seems
like a child's play to you.

899
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:47,060
But if you could think about this with an open mind,

900
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:50,390
you could perhaps understand
the depth between the both of us.

901
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:52,140
Depth!

902
01:20:52,690 --> 01:20:54,520
You use such big words boy!

903
01:20:55,270 --> 01:20:57,600
Dad..please let him finish

904
01:20:57,890 --> 01:21:00,140
Shut up you shameless girl!

905
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:02,350
How dare you bring this boy here again!

906
01:21:02,810 --> 01:21:04,440
Didn't you think about your family at least once!

907
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:07,100
You listen to me now!

908
01:21:07,940 --> 01:21:14,730
It is my dream, and a matter of pride and honour for me,
to get my daughter married to a boy from our caste!

909
01:21:15,020 --> 01:21:19,060
You stop dreaming about marrying her,
because it is impossible that I will ever agree to it.

910
01:21:26,020 --> 01:21:27,350
Are you out of your head?

911
01:21:30,230 --> 01:21:31,980
Your daughter is telling you that she loves me.

912
01:21:32,690 --> 01:21:34,480
I am telling you that I love her as well.

913
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:36,270
And this is how you treat me?

914
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:42,440
Im a learned man! Not some vagabond!

915
01:21:42,890 --> 01:21:43,730
Didn't I tell you?!

916
01:21:44,270 --> 01:21:46,560
Didn't I tell you this boy has a forked tongue?!

917
01:21:56,850 --> 01:21:57,520
Then I can't do this anymore.

918
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:07,940
You should've told your dad about
what happened between us.

919
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:10,520
What is wrong with you Arjun, what is that gesture?

920
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,390
I am not capable of any magical poetry right now.

921
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:16,520
It's pointless if I do. Because your dad thinks
it's impossible for us to be together.

922
01:22:17,190 --> 01:22:18,890
He'd have known if he saw us together.

923
01:22:29,690 --> 01:22:30,140
Preethi!

924
01:22:32,190 --> 01:22:33,230
Preethi! What happened?

925
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:34,690
Ey, who the hell are you?

926
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:37,230
Ey, call the cops (100).

927
01:22:40,940 --> 01:22:41,890
Preethi tell them to leave.

928
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:43,940
I won't, you tell them that.

929
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:44,890
Cut the call.

930
01:22:58,270 --> 01:23:01,310
Arjun, what does it mean, to deserve
or to be respected, when in love?

931
01:23:01,350 --> 01:23:04,020
If you speak poetically now, I will smash your face.

932
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:06,270
What kind of a man is he?

933
01:23:07,060 --> 01:23:09,190
Cant he understand? Can he listen if I tell him?

934
01:23:10,850 --> 01:23:14,190
What? Huh? Say that again. Again.

935
01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:16,730
Im warning you, I will be lude.

936
01:23:22,890 --> 01:23:24,600
Preethi, imagine we were in the age of kings

937
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:28,690
Because he stopped us from being together,
I would have waged a war against your father.

938
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:32,730
I would have tied him in chains and caged him.

939
01:23:33,890 --> 01:23:35,600
And then I would've married you.

940
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:37,640
In traditional Tulu style.

941
01:23:38,190 --> 01:23:40,230
Are you mad? Have you completely lost it?

942
01:23:40,270 --> 01:23:41,890
Ya..I am lost it..I am gone.

943
01:23:45,390 --> 01:23:49,020
Don't everybody in the world keep saying,
I was born for you.

944
01:23:49,350 --> 01:23:50,560
And you, for me.

945
01:23:51,020 --> 01:23:52,140
Do you know what I think?

946
01:23:53,140 --> 01:23:53,890
It's not just you,

947
01:23:55,140 --> 01:23:59,350
your parents, their parents,
their grandparents were all born for me.

948
01:24:07,190 --> 01:24:08,190
And see what is happening here?

949
01:24:11,350 --> 01:24:12,270
Now, listen to me.

950
01:24:12,980 --> 01:24:14,440
I am giving you six hours' time.

951
01:24:14,850 --> 01:24:17,390
Decide what you want to do in these
six hours and then call me.

952
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:22,140
I am ready to do anything in order to live with you Preethi.

953
01:24:23,940 --> 01:24:25,600
But call me only if you're as mad as I am.

954
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:28,100
IF you don't..you know me.

955
01:24:30,390 --> 01:24:31,730
Please Arjun, dont complicate this so much.

956
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:34,560
What got complicated?

957
01:24:35,690 --> 01:24:37,060
You are just being scared.

958
01:24:37,890 --> 01:24:40,480
But what do you think will even happen?
They will just get you married.

959
01:24:40,810 --> 01:24:42,600
Go go go. Go get married. Go get married.

960
01:24:51,770 --> 01:24:52,230
Arjun!

961
01:24:59,020 --> 01:24:59,850
Preethi, let me go.

962
01:25:01,270 --> 01:25:02,770
Your bones will get dislocated I am warning you.

963
01:25:08,190 --> 01:25:11,520
Preethi! Look! Look! Your dad is watching us.
Your dad is watching us.

964
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:12,020
Let him.

965
01:25:20,730 --> 01:25:23,810
Baby, don't. Dont. Look here.

966
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:30,690
Baby, look here.

967
01:25:35,940 --> 01:25:38,980
Arjun, I am not going to leave you and go anywhere

968
01:25:40,100 --> 01:25:41,770
Do you think I can survive without you?

969
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:44,350
Speak to me baby!

970
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:08,520
So please leave.

971
01:26:20,940 --> 01:26:24,520
Song coming from DJ (music)

972
01:26:39,020 --> 01:26:39,560
What happened?

973
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:41,480
What happened? Nothing happened.

974
01:26:41,980 --> 01:26:43,390
Shouldn't I drink in your bachelor's party?

975
01:26:44,020 --> 01:26:44,980
Drink man!
What then?

976
01:28:20,140 --> 01:28:20,940
Ey Jagdish!

977
01:28:21,350 --> 01:28:21,770
Sir!

978
01:28:23,480 --> 01:28:24,560
Get me a paper and pen!

979
01:28:27,850 --> 01:28:28,440
Take this sir.

980
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:34,980
I have a headache, go get these medicines.

981
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:36,060
Yes sir!

982
01:30:22,100 --> 01:30:24,140
Arjun! Preethi is here man!

983
01:31:40,550 --> 01:31:41,430
Lucky bastard man!

984
01:31:42,550 --> 01:31:45,300
Who combines alcohol with morphine?
What is his problem?

985
01:31:45,340 --> 01:31:45,890
What can we say?

986
01:31:46,010 --> 01:31:48,720
If it peaked another point,
he would have been comatose.

987
01:31:49,890 --> 01:31:51,680
Sir, is there any chance he can wake up
by today afternoon?

988
01:31:53,010 --> 01:31:53,970
Don't you know it yourself Shiva?

989
01:31:54,390 --> 01:31:55,800
Why do you ask? For his brother's marriage?

990
01:31:56,640 --> 01:31:58,050
His girlfriend is getting married today in the afternoon.

991
01:31:59,010 --> 01:32:00,890
His girlfriend's getting married?! Does he know?!

992
01:32:02,090 --> 01:32:03,550
Is that the same girl, the one from
the college fight on Holi that day?

993
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:06,680
Disgusting! That entire town is cursed.

994
01:32:07,300 --> 01:32:09,550
Nobody from that college ever
prospered in any relationship

995
01:32:11,010 --> 01:32:12,680
Anyway, he won't get up until the next 36 hours.

996
01:32:13,260 --> 01:32:15,090
You give him this good news when he wakes up.

997
01:32:15,220 --> 01:32:17,300
I think I'll go mad if I hang around here.

998
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:28,550
Chants.

999
01:33:20,510 --> 01:33:21,510
Such noble doctors you are!

1000
01:33:22,090 --> 01:33:23,180
Throw that horrible thing away!

1001
01:33:24,090 --> 01:33:28,340
Arjun! Move his hand away from his heart dear,
his grandma is still alive!

1002
01:33:36,930 --> 01:33:39,720
Grandma, that girl is getting
married in the afternoon today.

1003
01:33:40,930 --> 01:33:41,970
Does he know this?

1004
01:33:42,430 --> 01:33:44,680
He doesn't know about it, if he did,
why would he even be here?

1005
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:53,260
Wasn't it just yesterday that I told them, that nothing's
going to happen to them, they'll be absolutely fine?

1006
01:33:57,680 --> 01:34:01,050
Akka(sister), what happened to him?
Why is he asleep this way?

1007
01:34:01,550 --> 01:34:02,510
You get out of here first!

1008
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:05,180
Nothing has happened to him, you get out first!

1009
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:11,430
Did you eat, Dad?

1010
01:34:12,220 --> 01:34:12,890
Yes.

1011
01:34:13,680 --> 01:34:14,470
Where is my mom? And sister?

1012
01:34:14,890 --> 01:34:15,970
They've gone to eat.

1013
01:34:17,390 --> 01:34:20,640
Listen , where is your friend?
He's absent from this entire wedding.

1014
01:34:20,930 --> 01:34:22,300
There is some fault in his system dad.

1015
01:34:23,260 --> 01:34:24,140
Is it diarrhoea?

1016
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:26,470
No. Stomach ache.

1017
01:34:26,510 --> 01:34:29,220
Drinking? Has he been drinking?
Not at all. Nothing of that sort.

1018
01:34:31,930 --> 01:34:33,220
Alright, you stay here. I'll be back in sometime.

1019
01:34:34,390 --> 01:34:34,840
Ok. You go.

1020
01:34:35,220 --> 01:34:37,760
Satyanarayana Vratam recital

1021
01:34:51,680 --> 01:34:52,470
Oh, you are awake sir..

1022
01:34:52,640 --> 01:34:53,760
Who put diapers on me?

1023
01:34:54,890 --> 01:34:57,550
Satyanarayana Vratam recital.

1024
01:35:08,430 --> 01:35:11,090
Satyanarayana Vratam recital.

1025
01:35:26,140 --> 01:35:28,140
Ey Shiva, give me a cigarette man, please!

1026
01:35:40,390 --> 01:35:41,340
Ey, remove this off my hand man, now.

1027
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:44,930
It won't come away like that.
You've got to soak it in water for two minutes.

1028
01:35:45,680 --> 01:35:46,680
You don't have any patience do you?

1029
01:35:47,090 --> 01:35:48,470
If you were patient for at least 5 minutes that day,

1030
01:35:48,550 --> 01:35:50,090
there could have been
some communication between you both.

1031
01:35:50,550 --> 01:35:54,430
So what now? Is she feeling sad that there's
no communication between the both of us?

1032
01:35:55,010 --> 01:35:56,550
No man. She told me about her marriage.

1033
01:35:57,430 --> 01:36:00,050
Let her get married then!
Let her get married and then die!

1034
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:02,590
Do you think my feelings
for her will change if she gets married?

1035
01:36:03,590 --> 01:36:05,300
She IS married.

1036
01:36:07,390 --> 01:36:07,930
This is the truth.

1037
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:11,090
Got married yesterday.

1038
01:36:29,680 --> 01:36:32,050
Hey, you can't do anything by going there now!
It's all over!

1039
01:36:35,300 --> 01:36:37,220
Pan leaves..dates..nut powder

1040
01:36:38,550 --> 01:36:39,840
Where are you off to?!

1041
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:44,090
You and your blessings!

1042
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:07,930
Oh my dear..

1043
01:37:08,510 --> 01:37:09,220
Arjun..

1044
01:37:10,050 --> 01:37:10,510
Arjun..

1045
01:37:11,390 --> 01:37:13,220
Arjun, get onto the bike.Get onto the bike first.

1046
01:37:31,220 --> 01:37:31,720
Preethi.

1047
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:33,340
Preethi.

1048
01:37:35,090 --> 01:37:36,720
Babu! She just got married. Dont, please!

1049
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:37,510
Preethi! Get up!

1050
01:37:37,590 --> 01:37:38,510
Get up Preethi!

1051
01:37:44,010 --> 01:37:45,010
You..

1052
01:37:47,890 --> 01:37:49,300
So please leave.

1053
01:38:06,260 --> 01:38:07,640
Brother! Please brother! Don't hit him!

1054
01:38:07,890 --> 01:38:15,180
Smash him! Break his back!
Make sure he never gets up again!

1055
01:38:15,260 --> 01:38:16,180
Uncle..please say..

1056
01:38:16,260 --> 01:38:17,470
Cant you understand when I'm speaking?

1057
01:38:18,010 --> 01:38:19,720
You bloody...

1058
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:21,390
Smash him! Break his back!

1059
01:38:21,430 --> 01:38:24,180
IF YOU DON'T STOP HITTING HIM NOW,
I WILL SMASH THIS OLD MAN'S HEAD!

1060
01:38:28,300 --> 01:38:28,970
Alright, let him go.

1061
01:38:42,010 --> 01:38:42,470
Here you go.

1062
01:38:42,510 --> 01:38:47,430
Shiva, is marriage really that powerful?

1063
01:38:48,890 --> 01:38:52,470
Can't we do anything about it now?

1064
01:38:52,930 --> 01:38:54,010
Should we just shut up and keep quiet?

1065
01:38:55,340 --> 01:38:57,470
If I'm comatose for two days,
how can she get married like that?

1066
01:38:59,720 --> 01:39:02,510
How can they force her when she has no interest in it?

1067
01:39:03,050 --> 01:39:04,720
You say shiva..what can I do?

1068
01:39:04,890 --> 01:39:07,760
When there was so much ruckus happening,
she didn't even turn around to see.

1069
01:39:08,010 --> 01:39:09,510
Not once! They give up very easily man!

1070
01:39:09,550 --> 01:39:10,930
Maybe she couldn't hear what was happening
because of the mantras being chanted!

1071
01:39:12,430 --> 01:39:13,890
Ok! What do you want to do now?!

1072
01:39:15,050 --> 01:39:16,140
She is my girl.

1073
01:39:18,260 --> 01:39:19,680
I'll go get her now, just you watch!

1074
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:32,430
Preethi

1075
01:39:36,220 --> 01:39:37,340
Come out now!

1076
01:39:37,470 --> 01:39:41,510
This wont do. Call the cops or
someone from a mental institution.

1077
01:39:42,010 --> 01:39:43,720
Come out now!

1078
01:39:49,010 --> 01:39:51,260
Shiva, give me a cigarette man

1079
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:02,680
You shouldn't smoke in the police station!

1080
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:09,800
Your brother's here.

1081
01:40:24,220 --> 01:40:26,340
Ey, take him inside through the back door.

1082
01:40:26,510 --> 01:40:27,050
Arjun!

1083
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:28,890
What are all those wounds on your face?

1084
01:40:29,390 --> 01:40:30,590
Did you go to that girl's house again?

1085
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:31,340
Why do you want to do this here?

1086
01:40:31,390 --> 01:40:33,970
Why do you want to do this here?
Let him go Ma.

1087
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:38,300
All the guests kept asking your dad about you.

1088
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:41,760
You weren't present in the group photo either!
Stop talking sillily Maa!

1089
01:40:42,390 --> 01:40:45,680
If you want a group photo, go get it digitised.

1090
01:40:46,050 --> 01:40:48,140
Ey Goutham, what's the big deal
about not attending your brother's marriage?

1091
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:49,470
Nothing at all.

1092
01:40:51,550 --> 01:40:52,680
I'll leave after the reception.

1093
01:40:52,840 --> 01:40:53,890
Reception or nothing..get out.

1094
01:40:54,430 --> 01:40:54,890
Daddy!

1095
01:40:55,470 --> 01:40:55,930
Out.

1096
01:40:58,050 --> 01:40:59,260
Daddy, wait daddy!

1097
01:41:04,550 --> 01:41:05,140
Go.

1098
01:41:19,050 --> 01:41:21,390
Ey! Couldn't you have asked him to come inside?

1099
01:41:21,510 --> 01:41:23,180
His system's not well Dad. Let him be.

1100
01:41:23,340 --> 01:41:25,180
Wait, what? Does he have diarrhea again?

1101
01:41:25,340 --> 01:41:28,430
Stop it dad! You're always talking
about diarrhea, all the time!

1102
01:41:29,430 --> 01:41:31,510
But no..listen, I took that quarter whiskey
from your almirah. Ok?

1103
01:41:38,760 --> 01:41:39,800
He's not eating. Take that plate away.

1104
01:42:29,390 --> 01:42:29,890
Whats up?

1105
01:42:30,090 --> 01:42:31,390
I got a new job Shiva.

1106
01:42:31,930 --> 01:42:32,510
Congrats man.

1107
01:42:32,890 --> 01:42:35,010
So you're going to start a new life now.

1108
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:36,970
Did you see Preethi around anywhere?

1109
01:42:37,430 --> 01:42:38,550
Did you see Preethi around anywhere?

1110
01:42:38,970 --> 01:42:40,840
Didn't you go there to take your bike?

1111
01:42:41,970 --> 01:42:43,220
No man, I sent my father to get it.

1112
01:42:45,180 --> 01:42:47,510
Oh..ask your father if he saw her around somewhere.

1113
01:42:48,050 --> 01:42:50,050
I am at my clinic now, I'll call you later.

1114
01:43:18,470 --> 01:43:25,510
Came to know that you are not mine

1115
01:43:26,220 --> 01:43:32,970
Came to know that I am not yours

1116
01:43:33,890 --> 01:43:35,720
That half of me now does not exist

1117
01:43:35,890 --> 01:43:39,260
Shiva, Preethi never even matched her
gaze with anybody else in college.

1118
01:43:45,140 --> 01:43:46,300
That is when it all started.

1119
01:43:47,680 --> 01:43:48,930
What did his father say to me that day?

1120
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:54,800
My caste, my pride! Who taught him all this?
Where did this come from?

1121
01:43:56,010 --> 01:43:57,180
How cruel is this!

1122
01:43:57,720 --> 01:43:58,800
How unfair!

1123
01:43:58,970 --> 01:44:02,680
If Preethi and I were together,
there would have been a byproduct- our baby!

1124
01:44:11,390 --> 01:44:13,090
Is there any love in an arranged marriage?

1125
01:44:14,220 --> 01:44:15,140
I, atleast, have no belief in it.

1126
01:44:15,930 --> 01:44:18,510
People get hysterical about a couple's first night.

1127
01:44:23,180 --> 01:44:26,890
My past laughed seeing me now

1128
01:44:27,090 --> 01:44:34,890
That future will no more be there

1129
01:44:35,510 --> 01:44:38,470
This moment said so

1130
01:44:42,430 --> 01:44:49,550
You are my life, you are my heart

1131
01:44:50,300 --> 01:44:57,390
You settled as the fire in the heart

1132
01:45:30,930 --> 01:45:38,260
The unexpected has happened , how now?

1133
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:46,050
No more that you can say her now, what is this?

1134
01:45:46,390 --> 01:45:53,800
Mistake happened in a fraction of second

1135
01:45:54,180 --> 01:46:02,010
It is haunting as a flood of sorrow

1136
01:46:02,090 --> 01:46:13,260
I do not exist without you, said this moment

1137
01:46:16,840 --> 01:46:24,300
You are my end and you are my challenge

1138
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:32,300
My challenge is worth this universe

1139
01:46:32,550 --> 01:46:34,550
It's been 4 months since she got married.

1140
01:46:34,890 --> 01:46:36,890
Good or bad, she took a step forward in life.

1141
01:46:37,550 --> 01:46:39,720
Look at yourself, stuck in life.

1142
01:46:40,930 --> 01:46:43,470
Yeah man! In the practical world, it is a sign of progress.

1143
01:46:44,390 --> 01:46:47,430
You've been harping about Preethi's
marriage for 500 times now.

1144
01:46:47,470 --> 01:46:48,970
I will harp about it for 5000 times if necessary.

1145
01:46:54,180 --> 01:46:54,760
Come here Shiva.

1146
01:46:55,050 --> 01:46:57,180
No. You'll hit me.
I won't, I promise. Come here.

1147
01:47:02,590 --> 01:47:07,760
You know, assume your girlfriend is going through PMS..

1148
01:47:08,550 --> 01:47:09,550
I don't have a girlfriend in the first place.

1149
01:47:09,680 --> 01:47:10,840
Which is why I said assume you have one.

1150
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:16,340
In that time, will you say,
Baby, this pain occurs every month,

1151
01:47:17,180 --> 01:47:19,300
just wear it out the next 4 days it'll go away anyway?

1152
01:47:22,470 --> 01:47:25,720
Or will you get close to her, let her rest on your thighs..

1153
01:47:27,140 --> 01:47:28,760
and my thighs I don't mean it
derogatorily you Karimnagar immigrant!

1154
01:47:30,090 --> 01:47:32,140
Thighs meaning your lap.

1155
01:47:33,720 --> 01:47:38,220
Won't you let her rest in your lap,
understand her pain and be attentive?

1156
01:47:39,220 --> 01:47:40,390
Didn't we study medicine?

1157
01:47:41,640 --> 01:47:44,180
Won't you ask her to flex her hips
and knees and sleep on her side?

1158
01:47:45,430 --> 01:47:47,760
Or will you say, Since you're born a woman,
this is your fate.

1159
01:47:48,010 --> 01:47:49,340
Deal with it!

1160
01:47:49,550 --> 01:47:52,300
Listen..forget all that.
Why did you have to bring up my nativity now?

1161
01:47:53,180 --> 01:47:55,260
What did you even understand man? You dolt!

1162
01:47:55,300 --> 01:47:57,090
I understood every single thing you said.

1163
01:47:57,140 --> 01:48:03,840
Right now, you need to be treated like
a woman who is going through her PMS.

1164
01:48:04,470 --> 01:48:07,720
They go through it 4 days a month,
while you are PMS-ing all throughout. Isn't that it?

1165
01:48:08,340 --> 01:48:11,800
I can't bear your mood swings,
I need to go to my clinic..it's time.

1166
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:33,680
Came to know that you are not mine

1167
01:48:34,470 --> 01:48:41,260
Came to know that I am not yours

1168
01:48:58,800 --> 01:48:59,550
Namaste sir!

1169
01:49:00,640 --> 01:49:01,390
Ah! You're here!

1170
01:49:01,510 --> 01:49:03,010
She will work silently from now.

1171
01:49:03,180 --> 01:49:04,010
Please put her back to work sir.

1172
01:49:04,300 --> 01:49:05,840
Look how he hurt himself after she broke that glass.

1173
01:49:06,510 --> 01:49:07,890
She broke 10 glasses till now.

1174
01:49:08,090 --> 01:49:09,510
Ill pay you back for all those 10 glasses sir.

1175
01:49:09,720 --> 01:49:10,550
No one needs the money!

1176
01:49:11,340 --> 01:49:13,510
Did Not Sir tell her to call Preethi by her name?

1177
01:49:13,680 --> 01:49:17,430
And yet, she keeps calling her weird names
and that man keeps berating her.

1178
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:20,760
Does she quiet then? No! She keeps smirking !

1179
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:22,930
Are you listening, you devil!

1180
01:49:23,510 --> 01:49:25,590
How dare you call his wife such names?

1181
01:49:31,300 --> 01:49:34,300
Does anyone in this apartment pay you 2000 rupees
for the 5-10 minutes worth work you do here?

1182
01:49:34,890 --> 01:49:35,720
No one does, Sir.

1183
01:49:36,140 --> 01:49:39,430
As if that isn't enough, the moment she finishes work,
she goes down and assembles other maids,

1184
01:49:39,470 --> 01:49:46,180
turns into a team leader and keep gossipping
about all the people who live here!

1185
01:49:46,390 --> 01:49:48,260
Useless gossip, all of it!

1186
01:49:49,550 --> 01:49:51,340
Those folks from the management
are breathing down my neck,

1187
01:49:51,640 --> 01:49:54,340
asking if Arjun Sir's getting some people over at night.

1188
01:49:54,590 --> 01:49:56,220
Why are you bothered about their activities, woman?

1189
01:49:57,390 --> 01:50:00,300
Tell me something.
How do you look at a girl and call her a case?

1190
01:50:00,590 --> 01:50:02,470
Aren't you a woman yourself?
Don't you know this basic courtesy?

1191
01:50:02,840 --> 01:50:04,970
Is that how you talk?

1192
01:50:05,890 --> 01:50:07,470
No, really! I want to know because I'm
really ignorant about this!

1193
01:50:07,800 --> 01:50:10,220
But these people are doctors!
Why would they do such things!

1194
01:50:11,430 --> 01:50:13,470
If something happens to him, who will be responsible?

1195
01:50:13,930 --> 01:50:16,050
Huh mister?

1196
01:50:16,510 --> 01:50:19,180
I won't say anything to Sir. Or to Preethi ma'am.

1197
01:50:19,640 --> 01:50:23,430
Wont gossip anymore. Will just finish
my work here and leave quietly.

1198
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:24,640
Ok, whatever. Go away now.

1199
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:34,140
You're smelling of whiskey.
Go pop some mouth fresheners.

1200
01:50:34,470 --> 01:50:36,090
m I going to smooch someone in there now?

1201
01:50:36,510 --> 01:50:38,340
You always have a comeback ready
for things like these, don't you?

1202
01:50:40,930 --> 01:50:45,340
Ey, you think you'd have done it if that Darling
Open The Door Dude didn't interrupt you that day?

1203
01:50:45,510 --> 01:50:46,260
Yes!

1204
01:50:46,390 --> 01:50:48,340
Yeah right! What is this nonsense that you're up to?

1205
01:50:48,510 --> 01:50:49,510
Calm down a little man.

1206
01:50:49,800 --> 01:50:51,680
How do YOU know about that Darling Open The Door Dude?

1207
01:50:51,720 --> 01:50:54,430
Eh, It was I who referred that patient to you!
It was that baby haircut girl no?

1208
01:50:54,510 --> 01:50:55,140
Yes.

1209
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:56,930
How did it all start man?

1210
01:50:58,760 --> 01:50:59,760
That guy had a radial fracture.

1211
01:51:01,140 --> 01:51:05,050
And that girl kept calling me everyday asking if she
could feed him chicken or lentils or god knows what.

1212
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:08,590
What did she think this was, jaundice?

1213
01:51:13,140 --> 01:51:16,340
That's when I realised. And I gave her my number.

1214
01:51:16,680 --> 01:51:17,340
Directly?!

1215
01:51:18,430 --> 01:51:19,010
Directly?!

1216
01:51:20,220 --> 01:51:21,220
How shameless you are man!

1217
01:51:22,300 --> 01:51:25,470
You went to fool around with her
but ended up shoving ice down there huh?!

1218
01:51:31,050 --> 01:51:34,050
Man this woman is annoying me
everyday to shave my beard.

1219
01:51:34,640 --> 01:51:36,180
Ey, don't take that seriously.

1220
01:51:36,640 --> 01:51:41,340
Listen, you think you can forget
Preethi if you fool around like this?

1221
01:51:41,890 --> 01:51:42,680
Understand?

1222
01:51:44,140 --> 01:51:45,430
Snap out of this idiocy first.
Look for a nice girl and date her,

1223
01:51:46,680 --> 01:51:47,550
why do you need to do all these things?

1224
01:51:50,510 --> 01:51:56,720
Are you crying? Stop crying you fool

1225
01:51:56,840 --> 01:51:57,970
Do boys cry?

1226
01:51:58,090 --> 01:52:00,050
Which is why I said, don't try to
be someone that you aren't.

1227
01:52:00,340 --> 01:52:02,510
How can you cry, you of all the people,
you with your personality..!

1228
01:52:03,300 --> 01:52:04,140
Why do you need to do all this?

1229
01:52:09,550 --> 01:52:13,800
Listen, go stand in the middle of Ameerpet's
cross roads in nothing but your underwear!

1230
01:52:14,220 --> 01:52:15,220
Let us see who wont fall for you!

1231
01:52:16,260 --> 01:52:19,430
People will line up for you!
Even now this guy's still crying about Preethi..

1232
01:52:27,180 --> 01:52:29,180
Sir, heroine Jia Sharma is here.

1233
01:52:29,720 --> 01:52:30,640
She's been referred to you apparently.

1234
01:52:32,140 --> 01:52:33,340
Why is this so empty?

1235
01:52:51,220 --> 01:52:52,010
I am your fan!

1236
01:52:52,470 --> 01:52:55,260
I keep watching your movies frequently.
You act very well.

1237
01:52:57,760 --> 01:53:01,390
If you ever want to shoot in our hospital,
you can call me anytime.

1238
01:53:01,800 --> 01:53:05,010
I will give you permissions.You can shoot happily.

1239
01:53:05,140 --> 01:53:10,340
They'll help you out with anything you need.
Free for you!

1240
01:53:11,800 --> 01:53:14,760
Take good care of Madam.
She shouldn't face any problem.

1241
01:53:15,140 --> 01:53:15,890
VIP Patient

1242
01:53:16,180 --> 01:53:18,590
EY! HAS THE WATER LEVEL IN YOUR BRAIN RISEN?

1243
01:53:18,970 --> 01:53:20,430
CAN'T YOU TELL THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN BLACK AND WHITE?

1244
01:53:20,760 --> 01:53:22,220
ARE YOU SENSE ORGANS EVEN WORKING

1245
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:40,510
Say what happened?

1246
01:53:40,760 --> 01:53:43,140
She was dancing and suddenly, her knee got twisted.

1247
01:53:43,510 --> 01:53:44,640
It's difficult for her to walk right now.

1248
01:53:53,390 --> 01:53:56,140
Durga! Get an ROM Knee Brace!

1249
01:53:56,680 --> 01:53:59,640
This should always be worn on your bare legs.
Not on your leggings.

1250
01:54:00,590 --> 01:54:02,430
Don't forget to take it off when you go to sleep.

1251
01:54:09,260 --> 01:54:10,260
Find out the doctor's number.

1252
01:54:13,300 --> 01:54:15,510
Don't act smart Lakshman.

1253
01:54:36,390 --> 01:54:38,340
Ey! You won't find anything of that sort on me!

1254
01:54:38,590 --> 01:54:39,590
Open your mouth! Look at your teeth!
What is this?

1255
01:54:39,890 --> 01:54:43,390
How much will you drink? What is all this here?

1256
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:45,510
What are you doing here? Smoking weed?

1257
01:54:45,680 --> 01:54:48,430
None of that is mine!
They're a friend's who lives upstairs.

1258
01:54:49,090 --> 01:54:50,090
How are you even living here?

1259
01:54:51,140 --> 01:54:52,930
I've come to take you away. Let's go now.

1260
01:54:53,260 --> 01:54:53,930
Ey! I'm not coming.

1261
01:54:54,180 --> 01:54:54,640
Why won't you come?

1262
01:54:55,090 --> 01:54:56,300
I wont, period. I won't.

1263
01:54:57,140 --> 01:54:59,140
How many days will you live out your ego trip?
Oh you think this is an ego trip huh?

1264
01:55:02,050 --> 01:55:02,890
Arjun, listen.

1265
01:55:04,220 --> 01:55:05,970
I will make sure dad himself talks to you.

1266
01:55:06,840 --> 01:55:07,640
I will set things for you.

1267
01:55:08,340 --> 01:55:09,010
Come, lets go.

1268
01:55:09,090 --> 01:55:11,140
This is not about Dad. I need some space.

1269
01:55:11,470 --> 01:55:13,640
What space man?
It's been 4 months since you've come home!

1270
01:55:13,720 --> 01:55:14,720
Why do you want to discuss that topic now?

1271
01:55:19,010 --> 01:55:22,890
Your favourite is a.. Royal Enfield.. Interceptor isn't it?

1272
01:55:24,140 --> 01:55:26,340
I ordered one. It'll be here tomorrow.

1273
01:55:27,550 --> 01:55:28,550
Come lets go.

1274
01:55:29,970 --> 01:55:31,010
Why do you have so much anger?

1275
01:55:31,090 --> 01:55:31,640
I won't come.

1276
01:55:31,720 --> 01:55:32,470
Im only asking you to come home,?

1277
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:33,590
I won't come, leave me.

1278
01:55:33,930 --> 01:55:35,340
I had a lot of difficulty to find your address.

1279
01:55:35,640 --> 01:55:38,220
Who asked you to look for my address? Did I?

1280
01:55:38,390 --> 01:55:39,260
I seem fine here don't I?

1281
01:55:39,470 --> 01:55:40,510
There is no way I will leave you here now.

1282
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:41,590
Come lets go.

1283
01:55:41,970 --> 01:55:42,970
Hey leave me.

1284
01:55:45,470 --> 01:55:47,260
Yes alright, it was I who drank all those bottles.

1285
01:55:47,510 --> 01:55:49,550
Im smoking ganja here as well.
What will you do about it?

1286
01:55:50,390 --> 01:55:51,010
It is my wish.

1287
01:55:51,340 --> 01:55:52,140
I won't come, go!

1288
01:55:52,430 --> 01:55:53,260
You beat up me

1289
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:54,970
Hey leave me..

1290
01:55:55,680 --> 01:55:56,680
Leave me you...

1291
01:56:00,930 --> 01:56:02,890
I won't leave you..

1292
01:56:07,930 --> 01:56:09,510
No matter what you do, I won't come.

1293
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:12,760
Ask to come..

1294
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:20,970
Where did you go for your honeymoon?

1295
01:56:22,680 --> 01:56:23,510
Nowhere.

1296
01:56:23,890 --> 01:56:24,430
Why is that?

1297
01:56:28,470 --> 01:56:29,590
Since you went into exile..

1298
01:56:30,640 --> 01:56:31,640
how would I go?

1299
01:56:32,180 --> 01:56:34,760
Does that mean, you folks have not done..?
Ey! Nothing of that sort!

1300
01:56:37,260 --> 01:56:38,140
So when is the good news then?

1301
01:56:38,930 --> 01:56:39,890
Haven't thought about it.

1302
01:56:40,890 --> 01:56:42,140
Thinking of planning it in the next two years.

1303
01:56:42,640 --> 01:56:43,470
You're planning it?

1304
01:56:44,590 --> 01:56:50,050
Does anyone plan these things out?
It has to happen, in the flow.

1305
01:56:52,340 --> 01:56:53,840
What plan?

1306
01:57:01,390 --> 01:57:02,550
Would you like to drink some tea,coffee or juice?

1307
01:57:03,140 --> 01:57:04,260
Do you have any juice?
Yes sir.

1308
01:57:04,720 --> 01:57:05,260
Get that.

1309
01:57:05,510 --> 01:57:08,090
Madam is busy in a shot, she'll be here in 5 minutes.

1310
01:57:13,180 --> 01:57:14,180
Sir..juice.

1311
01:57:51,760 --> 01:57:52,430
Hi..Arjun.

1312
01:58:05,220 --> 01:58:06,470
Jia, I am going to tell you a story.

1313
01:58:08,470 --> 01:58:08,890
Listen.

1314
01:58:11,260 --> 01:58:12,970
When I was in college, there was a girl.

1315
01:58:15,090 --> 01:58:16,260
We lived together, almost.

1316
01:58:18,220 --> 01:58:19,220
She got married.

1317
01:58:21,510 --> 01:58:24,640
I keep trying so many things to forget her,
but it's not working out.

1318
01:58:25,340 --> 01:58:27,760
Ayyoo..Im sorry.
Dont, dont, dont!

1319
01:58:28,640 --> 01:58:30,010
Listen, I don't want these feelings.

1320
01:58:37,510 --> 01:58:39,090
Can you help me out..physically?

1321
01:58:42,890 --> 01:58:44,840
I can bring you a medical certificate if you want.

1322
01:58:48,260 --> 01:58:50,340
Let's keep this open..raw.

1323
01:58:56,510 --> 01:58:57,430
Our wish.

1324
01:59:00,720 --> 01:59:03,890
Just you and me. Tell me?

1325
01:59:07,510 --> 01:59:09,050
Do you need time to think about it?

1326
01:59:10,510 --> 01:59:11,510
Tell me Jia.

1327
01:59:12,470 --> 01:59:13,010
Arjun!

1328
01:59:17,680 --> 01:59:18,220
What happened man?

1329
01:59:19,390 --> 01:59:20,390
Jia, that's my friend.

1330
01:59:35,510 --> 01:59:37,510
Ey Shiva! Sit.

1331
01:59:37,550 --> 01:59:38,010
Look!

1332
01:59:38,640 --> 01:59:42,640
Ey Kamal! How are you man?

1333
01:59:42,840 --> 01:59:43,470
Fine..

1334
01:59:43,800 --> 01:59:45,470
When did you come here?
I just came today in the morning.

1335
01:59:47,010 --> 01:59:49,680
Ok..so what's happening..oh by the way,
what happened to your license?

1336
01:59:49,800 --> 01:59:50,260
Got cleared!

1337
01:59:53,140 --> 01:59:54,140
So whats happening?

1338
01:59:54,260 --> 01:59:57,430
Same old man..Keerthi said she'll speak
to her parents about our marriage.

1339
01:59:57,930 --> 01:59:59,300
So, thats why Im here in India.

1340
01:59:59,800 --> 02:00:01,760
Was yours such a serious relationship?

1341
02:00:04,840 --> 02:00:08,300
Man, listen to me. There are caste fanatics everywhere!

1342
02:00:09,050 --> 02:00:11,590
Just be guarded.If it works out, it will.

1343
02:00:11,970 --> 02:00:13,090
Otherwise you'll turn out to be like me.

1344
02:00:14,470 --> 02:00:16,390
What miseries do you have man?
Hanging around with heroines.

1345
02:00:16,430 --> 02:00:18,390
The both of you were in some serious
conversation when we got here.

1346
02:00:19,140 --> 02:00:20,300
Did you set her up, you dirty fellow?

1347
02:00:21,430 --> 02:00:23,930
No way man. Just came here to talk to her.

1348
02:00:25,470 --> 02:00:26,590
What did you want to talk to her about?

1349
02:00:28,470 --> 02:00:29,180
The same thing..

1350
02:00:30,470 --> 02:00:36,180
Told her about Preethi and asked her if she
could help me out, in a physical sense.

1351
02:00:36,470 --> 02:00:37,470
Physical help huh?

1352
02:00:40,260 --> 02:00:41,260
So what did she say?

1353
02:00:41,970 --> 02:00:44,970
I'm sure she'll come around, but what about you?

1354
02:00:45,300 --> 02:00:46,300
What about me.. Im casual, as usual.

1355
02:00:46,970 --> 02:00:48,550
How many more days will you sit in that clinic?

1356
02:00:49,300 --> 02:00:53,260
Breathe in..paracetamol calpol prescriptions
Doesn't that bore you?

1357
02:00:53,890 --> 02:00:57,590
You stop hanging out with those
idiots in those cafes in Moula Ali.

1358
02:00:58,010 --> 02:00:59,140
Become serious about your job.

1359
02:00:59,720 --> 02:01:03,890
This fellow acquired his license,
it's been 6 months since I passed my Masters.

1360
02:01:04,640 --> 02:01:06,140
How many more days will you sit in that clinic?

1361
02:01:06,720 --> 02:01:08,220
Man! Did you see his clinic?

1362
02:01:08,930 --> 02:01:11,720
Go see his clinic sometime!
Show him your clinic man!

1363
02:01:12,430 --> 02:01:13,800
Is that even a clinic, you donkey?

1364
02:01:15,260 --> 02:01:17,010
Do you know who his patients are?

1365
02:01:17,390 --> 02:01:21,390
You know those people who have no problem in life
but just keep walking into clinics right? Those kinds.

1366
02:01:23,140 --> 02:01:24,680
How many people turn up at your clinic everyday?

1367
02:01:25,430 --> 02:01:26,510
3..or 4?

1368
02:01:28,550 --> 02:01:32,300
And to top this, he is always worrying about going
to his clinic, getting late to his clinic, clinic, clinic, clinic..

1369
02:01:32,760 --> 02:01:36,590
Who am I speaking to, who am I meeting,
what am I doing.. How is this any of your concern?

1370
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:39,760
Kamal, this guy is a sex freak man!

1371
02:01:40,510 --> 02:01:44,340
Yeah sure. Me. A sex freak. Definitely true.

1372
02:01:46,390 --> 02:01:48,010
It's time you became serious, became a surgeon.

1373
02:01:48,760 --> 02:01:51,970
Cut a body. Get some blood on your hands. That is fun.

1374
02:01:53,260 --> 02:01:57,430
If I wasn't hungover about Preethi,
I would've cracked neuro by now.

1375
02:01:58,340 --> 02:02:00,390
Let this get done. I will show you.

1376
02:02:02,220 --> 02:02:02,890
Arjun

1377
02:02:11,010 --> 02:02:12,970
What the hell is wrong with him?
He is speaking like he's in some trance or something.

1378
02:02:50,390 --> 02:03:06,970
Your new company started like a
new address of happiness strangely

1379
02:03:07,640 --> 02:03:13,090
Bonding is loosening and it is not a mistake, right?

1380
02:03:13,760 --> 02:03:25,930
Your new company started like a new surprise

1381
02:04:08,220 --> 02:04:11,090
Ey Shiva,what is wrong with this girl,
she is ironing my clothes.

1382
02:04:11,340 --> 02:04:12,010
Who?

1383
02:04:12,140 --> 02:04:12,930
Jia Sharma.

1384
02:04:13,800 --> 02:04:14,550
And where are you?

1385
02:04:14,800 --> 02:04:16,220
At her house. Just got up.

1386
02:04:16,550 --> 02:04:18,800
Oho! So this matter's gone to that level now huh?

1387
02:04:19,140 --> 02:04:20,550
Ey, nothing has happened yet.

1388
02:04:20,840 --> 02:04:22,800
Yeah right. Don't tell me.
You're not the kind to let go of such situations.

1389
02:04:23,010 --> 02:04:23,930
There's nothing of that sort happening.

1390
02:04:24,140 --> 02:04:25,140
What do you mean, nothing of that sort?

1391
02:04:25,180 --> 02:04:27,340
Listen, I read that girl's Wikipedia page.

1392
02:04:27,800 --> 02:04:30,010
This girl passed out of IIT Ahmedabad.

1393
02:04:30,180 --> 02:04:32,720
Her father retired as the Delhi High Court's Chief Justice.

1394
02:04:32,970 --> 02:04:36,510
Do you understand? You won't find a better match.
Figure something out and settle down.

1395
02:04:36,640 --> 02:04:41,430
Don't you understand? If she's ironing your
clothes, she's really into you man..!

1396
02:04:41,890 --> 02:04:43,720
I don't like it when people do these things for me.

1397
02:04:44,470 --> 02:04:48,010
I would like to do it for people I love.
And I felt this way only with Preethi.

1398
02:04:48,550 --> 02:04:52,970
Man! That is all over now man! That girl got married
and left! It's time you got out of that chapter!

1399
02:04:53,050 --> 02:04:55,930
How many more day will you go
around crying Preethi,Preethi, Preethi..

1400
02:04:56,260 --> 02:04:58,260
If you keep drinking this way everyday,
you will die you fool!

1401
02:05:04,180 --> 02:05:05,180
When did you come Dad?

1402
02:05:05,930 --> 02:05:06,590
Just now.

1403
02:05:06,840 --> 02:05:09,800
It's been 5 minutes. Come, sit.

1404
02:05:15,340 --> 02:05:18,640
What happened? Your friend hasn't
come out of that phase, seemingly?

1405
02:05:20,760 --> 02:05:23,550
They were a strong couple Dad. Very strong.

1406
02:05:24,180 --> 02:05:26,090
It lasted 4 years! It won't get
solved that easily now, will it?

1407
02:05:26,340 --> 02:05:27,720
True. Correct.

1408
02:05:29,220 --> 02:05:32,050
You know these therapy sessions
for cancer survivors,right?

1409
02:05:32,300 --> 02:05:34,720
There is one of a similar nature called 'Love Failure
Support Group' in Basheerbagh started by some guy.

1410
02:05:35,590 --> 02:05:39,180
What he does is he gives you
a questionnaire with 10-20 questions.

1411
02:05:39,470 --> 02:05:42,140
What would you do if you met that
person you love in this particular situation?

1412
02:05:42,550 --> 02:05:44,800
The participant must choose from
those options named A,B,C,D,E..

1413
02:05:45,010 --> 02:05:46,640
Based on the answers you've selected,

1414
02:05:46,840 --> 02:05:50,840
he will assess you, your pain and your situation.

1415
02:05:51,090 --> 02:05:54,640
he will assess you, your pain and your situation.

1416
02:05:55,220 --> 02:05:56,470
Our Sir topped that exams as well.

1417
02:05:56,840 --> 02:05:58,050
He topped that exam as well!

1418
02:05:58,550 --> 02:05:59,390
Fine..

1419
02:05:59,640 --> 02:06:03,300
That guy called me up and says,
Sir, I come across a lot of hundreds of cases everyday

1420
02:06:03,800 --> 02:06:05,260
but I have never seen such a case like your friend's.

1421
02:06:05,590 --> 02:06:07,840
You please take back your money
and your friend as well.”

1422
02:06:09,550 --> 02:06:10,590
So what now?

1423
02:06:13,590 --> 02:06:17,050
He has all kinds of habits. All kinds.
He brings ladies home at night.

1424
02:06:17,510 --> 02:06:18,550
What are you saying?

1425
02:06:19,890 --> 02:06:21,970
Yeah! You think I'm joking? It's the truth Dad!

1426
02:06:22,680 --> 02:06:27,510
But you know, he doesn't do anything with them..
physically. No touching or anything of that sort!

1427
02:06:27,800 --> 02:06:31,050
He just sits them down and explains
all kinds of big fancy theories.

1428
02:06:31,220 --> 02:06:33,590
And listening to him, these women go home bawling!

1429
02:06:33,760 --> 02:06:35,640
Bawling till their faces turn red!

1430
02:06:35,930 --> 02:06:40,010
But their cries have no effect on him!
He is just carried away in his own trip

1431
02:06:40,220 --> 02:06:41,840
I've stopped drinking with him
because of this very reason!

1432
02:06:43,470 --> 02:06:44,390
But you know, their business is running great!

1433
02:06:44,430 --> 02:06:48,840
They listen to his stories but they take his money and go
home happily, this guy keeps telling them more stories..

1434
02:06:49,050 --> 02:06:52,890
You know, for anybody else, speaking their heart out
like this helps them out emotionally, but in his case,

1435
02:06:53,010 --> 02:06:54,720
it just aggravates him!

1436
02:06:55,640 --> 02:06:56,640
Okay

1437
02:06:59,430 --> 02:07:06,140
And when it's time for festivals, like Krishnashtami,
Dussehra, anything..Bonalu or whatever,

1438
02:07:06,390 --> 02:07:10,300
all these women get decked up
and turn up at his place like one big tribe!

1439
02:07:10,640 --> 02:07:21,800
And they feed him biryani, pongal,
sweetmeats..what not! Full enjoy!

1440
02:07:21,970 --> 02:07:26,300
Tickle tickle laugh laugh, selfies.. No end to their festivities.

1441
02:07:27,470 --> 02:07:28,970
Don't laugh Dad? Why does this seem funny to you?

1442
02:07:29,260 --> 02:07:31,050
Who won't laugh when someone is enjoying like this?

1443
02:07:31,340 --> 02:07:32,760
The folks from his apartment's management call me up

1444
02:07:32,800 --> 02:07:35,340
and keep telling me that this friend of
yours is up to all these activities here,

1445
02:07:35,430 --> 02:07:37,550
are you going to ask him to clear the place or not?

1446
02:07:39,180 --> 02:07:40,140
Oh and you know something else?

1447
02:07:40,340 --> 02:07:42,220
There is a chief woman who heads all these women right?

1448
02:07:42,590 --> 02:07:45,930
You know..like they are shown in films
big, chewing a paan,

1449
02:07:46,010 --> 02:07:46,840
yeah yeah, that woman.

1450
02:07:47,050 --> 02:07:54,220
Now whenever she falls ill, or someone she happens to
know falls ill, they all get together and visit Dr Arjun Reddy.

1451
02:07:54,590 --> 02:07:58,140
Because me, our neighbour Srinivas uncle, we're no doctors.

1452
02:07:58,220 --> 02:08:00,300
Because there is no other doctor in
this city apart from Arjun Reddy right?

1453
02:08:00,930 --> 02:08:02,090
Hmm..true, Arjun Reddy is the only doctor in town.

1454
02:08:02,220 --> 02:08:03,430
Even now, just before you came here,
we were discussing the same thing.

1455
02:08:03,800 --> 02:08:04,930
There's a film heroine Daddy!

1456
02:08:05,010 --> 02:08:06,260
That girl likes him a lot!

1457
02:08:06,890 --> 02:08:11,390
But even there, nothing will work out for him, because
he has decided to sink and swim in that pain and grief.

1458
02:08:12,680 --> 02:08:15,470
Look. The same gossip. It's even out in the newspapers

1459
02:08:21,680 --> 02:08:23,090
What is this place that you brought me to Madam Heroine?

1460
02:08:24,760 --> 02:08:26,340
What if someone sees us?

1461
02:08:28,550 --> 02:08:29,890
Lakshman will take care of it.

1462
02:08:59,970 --> 02:09:01,510
Madam..madam, you please sit inside madam.
Get off.

1463
02:09:06,090 --> 02:09:07,890
I told you off twice about this lovey dovey nonsense.

1464
02:09:09,550 --> 02:09:12,550
All of that won't work out for me.
Why are you mixing this with love?

1465
02:09:14,300 --> 02:09:19,590
You have intelligence right?
I am not going to meet you, you don't either

1466
02:09:47,140 --> 02:09:49,430
Sir, this is Durga from the hospital!

1467
02:09:49,590 --> 02:09:50,090
Say.

1468
02:09:50,140 --> 02:09:52,550
Sir, there's a case from Prabhu Sir.

1469
02:09:52,840 --> 02:09:54,390
Durga today is my day off. Put the phone down.

1470
02:10:01,470 --> 02:10:03,970
Sir, please, there is no one here.

1471
02:10:07,430 --> 02:10:10,390
Durga, I am in no state to conduct any surgery.
Cut the call.

1472
02:10:10,640 --> 02:10:12,760
Please sir! I could give you some all-pax if you like!

1473
02:10:13,010 --> 02:10:15,180
There's been a lot of blood loss.

1474
02:10:19,300 --> 02:10:21,470
Put the patient on a ventilator. I'll be there

1475
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:23,930
Ok sir, I'll get that done right away.

1476
02:11:43,430 --> 02:11:43,970
Durga!

1477
02:11:45,010 --> 02:11:45,800
What happened?

1478
02:11:46,640 --> 02:11:47,470
What happened?

1479
02:11:48,930 --> 02:11:50,890
This is a matter of prestige for Citizen's Hospital,

1480
02:11:52,140 --> 02:11:54,590
I will get his license cancelled come what may!

1481
02:11:55,010 --> 02:12:00,050
I'll go to any length! Tell your favourite surgeon,
I will see him in the court.

1482
02:12:13,390 --> 02:12:14,260
What happened?

1483
02:12:20,260 --> 02:12:25,590
Shiva, there comes a time in your life when your body
rings a warning bell saying its capacity is over.

1484
02:12:25,970 --> 02:12:28,260
That is when you should stop everything.
He should stop everything right away!

1485
02:12:29,090 --> 02:12:30,220
He is not listening to anybody sir!

1486
02:12:30,260 --> 02:12:31,800
He has to! Otherwise he'll die!

1487
02:12:32,010 --> 02:12:33,680
How did you get so dehydrated Arjun?

1488
02:12:34,590 --> 02:12:38,550
Have you been drinking everyday?
Have you not quit your bad habits?

1489
02:12:38,890 --> 02:12:40,970
Yes! Im drinking everyday! So what now?

1490
02:12:42,010 --> 02:12:45,430
Mummy, this is just a phase in my life, understand that.
Don't ask me trashy questions.

1491
02:12:48,390 --> 02:12:51,550
This hospital and mine have a lot of
patient exchange programs.

1492
02:12:52,010 --> 02:12:52,430
Ok?

1493
02:12:52,720 --> 02:12:54,970
The minute I came here I spoke to the Director.
He is not listening.

1494
02:12:56,050 --> 02:12:58,720
Says he will speak to the police professionally
but he isn't agreeing to anything.

1495
02:12:59,720 --> 02:13:02,590
Says he will go to any length to see this through.
He's acting all psyched.

1496
02:13:04,760 --> 02:13:06,180
Says your friend belongs in the jail.

1497
02:13:06,800 --> 02:13:09,180
Apparently, this matter's gone all the way to AIIMS.

1498
02:13:09,890 --> 02:13:11,260
Did you see that ?

1499
02:13:11,800 --> 02:13:13,180
You know what that means right?

1500
02:13:18,300 --> 02:13:21,180
This guy.. He has a knack for rubbing
himself exactly with the wrong kind of people!

1501
02:13:22,640 --> 02:13:24,800
What is with your 2008 St.Mary's batch?

1502
02:13:25,340 --> 02:13:27,800
I've never seen a batch worse than yours.
You, him!

1503
02:13:28,590 --> 02:13:30,140
How dare you dont shave and come to the hospital!

1504
02:13:31,260 --> 02:13:32,840
No matter what we do, our appearance has got to be neat.

1505
02:13:34,300 --> 02:13:39,260
Shall I tell you something? That
morphine episode was his personal shit.

1506
02:13:39,840 --> 02:13:42,680
But this is now professional!
The entire country is watching man!

1507
02:13:43,010 --> 02:13:44,050
It's a big deal!

1508
02:13:55,550 --> 02:14:00,010
He had anger issues. But alcoholism? Drug addict?

1509
02:14:16,250 --> 02:14:18,920
Grandma, up until yesterday,
you kept asking me where he was!

1510
02:14:19,340 --> 02:14:21,670
Now you know where he is! But you won't come! Why?!

1511
02:14:22,790 --> 02:14:24,540
I cant see him in these circumstances.

1512
02:14:24,920 --> 02:14:25,590
Don't then!

1513
02:14:26,540 --> 02:14:27,840
But at least call him and talk to him!

1514
02:14:28,920 --> 02:14:31,290
Grandma! If you call him, he will come home!

1515
02:14:32,880 --> 02:14:36,670
There is a difference when the people we love die
and when they leave us and go away.

1516
02:14:37,090 --> 02:14:42,750
In the first case, our minds and hearts adjust
to the fact that the person won't come back.

1517
02:14:43,250 --> 02:14:43,920
Like me.

1518
02:14:44,670 --> 02:14:47,040
In the second case, it doesn't fade away that easily.

1519
02:14:50,540 --> 02:14:51,210
Just like him.

1520
02:14:51,670 --> 02:14:56,250
I can help him out anyway but I can't share his pain right?

1521
02:14:56,340 --> 02:14:58,420
So what are you implying? That we leave him to his fate?

1522
02:15:40,210 --> 02:15:41,340
Vipul is a successful lawyer.

1523
02:15:42,790 --> 02:15:43,920
He will handle your case.

1524
02:15:44,290 --> 02:15:46,090
First of all don't call it a case.

1525
02:15:47,090 --> 02:15:48,170
It is not even my case.

1526
02:15:49,090 --> 02:15:51,670
Because there wasn't anybody in the emergency,
I had to go handle it.

1527
02:15:53,130 --> 02:15:54,540
Anyways, the patient is still alive isnt he?

1528
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:58,170
In cases like these, it is secondary
if the patient is alive or dead.

1529
02:15:58,630 --> 02:15:59,710
Primarily,

1530
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:03,920
the case rests upon how much alcohol the surgeon has
consumed and if it's above or below the permissible limits.

1531
02:16:04,290 --> 02:16:07,040
Basically, this is a criminal and medical negligence case.

1532
02:16:07,460 --> 02:16:09,790
So tell me Dr.Arjun, how much did you drink?

1533
02:16:16,920 --> 02:16:19,540
Goutham, do you even know in what state
I went to the hospital?

1534
02:16:20,590 --> 02:16:22,040
I had no motor control.

1535
02:16:23,290 --> 02:16:24,790
I was only being able to speak.

1536
02:16:25,420 --> 02:16:28,170
I sat in the chair and guided
the head nurse to complete the surgery.

1537
02:16:31,290 --> 02:16:33,170
We have heard all this, and have understood it as well.

1538
02:16:35,790 --> 02:16:37,090
Goutham, is this guy even on our side?

1539
02:16:37,790 --> 02:16:38,960
Then why is he speaking like this?

1540
02:16:42,840 --> 02:16:45,000
Arjun, this case has gone too far.

1541
02:16:45,920 --> 02:16:47,590
Even the IMC is now involved.

1542
02:16:50,840 --> 02:16:53,090
The entire hospital is trying to prove you guilty.

1543
02:16:58,420 --> 02:17:00,380
It is all over the news already.

1544
02:17:04,710 --> 02:17:07,340
Arjun, are you listening?

1545
02:17:10,340 --> 02:17:11,920
Just bear with some presence of mind.

1546
02:17:14,250 --> 02:17:17,340
This is material from the eye witnesses.
Your patients have signed here

1547
02:17:17,460 --> 02:17:18,920
saying you are a wonderful surgeon.

1548
02:17:19,340 --> 02:17:21,630
And these are a total of 484 radiographs.

1549
02:17:22,090 --> 02:17:25,460
There are 300 entries of surgeries under
your name in the hospital log-book.

1550
02:17:30,960 --> 02:17:33,500
A couple are not available, since they are out of station.

1551
02:17:33,710 --> 02:17:37,880
So, even if the log book seems like a farce,
your radiographs cannot be dismissed.

1552
02:17:38,040 --> 02:17:41,750
Because all of them are embossed with this
Referred by Dr. Arjun Reddy Deshmukh.

1553
02:17:45,750 --> 02:17:48,210
The point here is, the patient isnt dead. He's alive.

1554
02:17:48,380 --> 02:17:50,170
So we can pay him off with some amount of money.

1555
02:17:50,630 --> 02:17:54,090
The problem lies with the hospital management
who collected your blood samples.

1556
02:17:54,340 --> 02:17:57,920
And it shows that your alcohol level is above 140
and also you were high on cocaine.

1557
02:18:01,920 --> 02:18:02,670
So what do we do now?

1558
02:18:04,750 --> 02:18:06,670
They use a preservative to test that sample.

1559
02:18:06,960 --> 02:18:10,920
We can prove that the fermentation levels were off
and that the readings were not right.

1560
02:18:12,960 --> 02:18:15,290
Plus, there aren't any entries
for 184 surgeries that you have done

1561
02:18:15,500 --> 02:18:19,170
If you raise this point.. Im sure the hospital
management will plead guilty.

1562
02:18:20,130 --> 02:18:21,750
The hospital's director is being very stubborn.

1563
02:18:22,130 --> 02:18:23,460
Which is why we are preparing all this.

1564
02:18:23,840 --> 02:18:27,250
I think in another week,
we can arrange for an in-house court hearing.

1565
02:18:31,340 --> 02:18:33,420
Arjun, listen to me.

1566
02:18:33,880 --> 02:18:37,170
Get a neat shave, dress up well and come along calmly.

1567
02:18:37,710 --> 02:18:40,340
Whatever you are going to say that day,
keep repeating that constantly.

1568
02:18:49,880 --> 02:18:51,630
We've sealed every hole properly.

1569
02:18:52,090 --> 02:18:55,040
My only worry is your brother's unconventional mindset.

1570
02:18:55,960 --> 02:18:59,380
Goutham, in a democracy,
this level of free spiritedness doesn't work!

1571
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:00,840
You will have to take care of it.

1572
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:04,590
And no matter how much money you pay them off,

1573
02:19:04,920 --> 02:19:08,170
if you put up that expression on your face,
it won't augur well.

1574
02:19:44,750 --> 02:19:45,290
Arjun..

1575
02:19:46,790 --> 02:19:47,340
Arjun..

1576
02:19:48,290 --> 02:19:48,960
Ey..Shiva.

1577
02:19:59,130 --> 02:20:01,170
Oh man! This guy is drunk again!

1578
02:20:03,500 --> 02:20:04,750
Shiva, pull that chair!

1579
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:18,790
Listen, I'll call Ankit and get some stuff.

1580
02:20:21,540 --> 02:20:23,630
Arjun, you're getting late for the court hearing!

1581
02:20:44,590 --> 02:20:45,210
What is that?

1582
02:20:49,210 --> 02:20:50,340
What are you doing man?

1583
02:20:50,750 --> 02:20:51,500
Be quiet

1584
02:20:52,170 --> 02:20:54,380
Why do you need this now?
EY! SHUT UP!

1585
02:20:59,090 --> 02:21:01,170
EY! GET UP! GET UP!

1586
02:21:02,290 --> 02:21:03,130
SNORT THIS! SNORT THIS HARD!

1587
02:21:30,880 --> 02:21:31,590
What's the status?

1588
02:21:32,380 --> 02:21:33,040
He is normal now.

1589
02:21:36,840 --> 02:21:39,590
Your brother has arranged
an in house court hearing for you.

1590
02:21:39,670 --> 02:21:41,420
For god's sake, try and be normal.

1591
02:21:44,210 --> 02:21:46,880
Are you going to teach me how
to be normal after drinking?

1592
02:21:46,960 --> 02:21:47,460
Ah alright!

1593
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:52,710
Wear your pants and come out.

1594
02:21:58,960 --> 02:22:01,340
Ma'am, this person has a drinking problem.

1595
02:22:01,840 --> 02:22:03,170
I realised that very late.

1596
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:07,460
Even the nurses got intimidated by him
and served liquor in the hospital.

1597
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:12,040
We found a lot of drugs in the surgeon's
dressing room as well.

1598
02:22:15,290 --> 02:22:18,590
The court rejects emotional statements.

1599
02:22:18,750 --> 02:22:22,630
There are 300 recorded videos and
testimonials on behalf of the patient.

1600
02:22:32,040 --> 02:22:37,000
Shiva, do you remember the oath
we took during the convocation?

1601
02:22:37,170 --> 02:22:39,540
Listen, the case is moving in your favour,
don't mess this up now.

1602
02:22:39,920 --> 02:22:40,920
But this is wrong!

1603
02:22:41,170 --> 02:22:43,840
Give me the statements and material
proofs from the accused.

1604
02:22:45,500 --> 02:22:48,040
Goutham, what is all this man?

1605
02:22:48,420 --> 02:22:49,630
How much money did you pay them off?

1606
02:22:51,590 --> 02:22:54,340
Look at our Dad once. He doesn't like all this.

1607
02:22:54,420 --> 02:22:55,420
Shut up man.

1608
02:22:56,840 --> 02:23:00,130
I claim my career as the only thing
I have ever made for myself.

1609
02:23:01,670 --> 02:23:04,500
And the only thing I like about myself is my profession.

1610
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:07,170
Don't corrupt it man.

1611
02:23:08,250 --> 02:23:11,250
Goutham, I can't live my life begging people like this.

1612
02:23:14,460 --> 02:23:17,790
Are you worried about your reputation if I go to jail now?

1613
02:23:18,090 --> 02:23:20,960
Tell me Goutham. Is that what you're thinking about?

1614
02:23:22,090 --> 02:23:25,290
I am not being able to understand anything.
What are you talking? stop it.

1615
02:23:25,710 --> 02:23:26,710
I will go, please.

1616
02:23:30,460 --> 02:23:37,000
Dr. Arjun, if you speak now,
it will be admissible in the criminal proceedings.

1617
02:23:39,040 --> 02:23:41,290
Nodding your head isn't enough.

1618
02:23:45,130 --> 02:23:47,130
What time did you attend your surgery?

1619
02:23:49,250 --> 02:23:49,960
Dont remember.

1620
02:24:08,090 --> 02:24:10,500
While conducting the surgery,
you lost control of your sense and fell down

1621
02:24:11,210 --> 02:24:15,130
but being half-conscious you directed
your nurse and stabilised the patient.

1622
02:24:22,920 --> 02:24:24,540
Did you consume any alcohol?

1623
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:51,130
Yes, I drank that day.

1624
02:24:52,880 --> 02:24:54,170
I drank the earlier day.

1625
02:24:56,420 --> 02:24:58,590
Ive conducted all my surgeries while being drunk.

1626
02:25:00,630 --> 02:25:01,710
I am drunk right now as well.

1627
02:25:08,420 --> 02:25:11,420
But it didn't harm any patient and I'm proud to say it.

1628
02:25:15,880 --> 02:25:18,750
But I broke that trust that a patient has on a doctor.

1629
02:25:27,460 --> 02:25:29,420
There is no relation to the hospital with this episode.

1630
02:25:52,340 --> 02:25:53,170
Dad, I'm sorry.

1631
02:26:05,710 --> 02:26:07,040
What did I say and what have you done?!

1632
02:27:15,710 --> 02:27:19,710
Ey Vidya! Has it been 2 years since
you got married you woman?

1633
02:27:20,920 --> 02:27:22,130
How come you aren't pregnant yet?

1634
02:27:23,340 --> 02:27:25,340
How long do you want to continue like this Arjun?

1635
02:27:25,670 --> 02:27:28,290
There has got to be some thought about your future right?

1636
02:27:28,750 --> 02:27:34,000
By this time, next year, where will you be, how will you be,
what will you be doing? There has got be a plan right?

1637
02:27:38,380 --> 02:27:42,250
Ey Kamal! Did you guys come together?

1638
02:27:44,210 --> 02:27:47,170
Arjun, my marriage has been fixed.

1639
02:27:47,500 --> 02:27:51,170
Wow! How normal you seem,
as if nothing ever happened!

1640
02:27:52,130 --> 02:27:54,790
Come..lets drink.

1641
02:27:55,750 --> 02:27:57,960
Didn't I tell you that Keerthi's father wouldn't agree?

1642
02:27:58,710 --> 02:27:59,500
Who is this girl anyway?

1643
02:27:59,880 --> 02:28:00,790
He is getting married to Keerthi herself!

1644
02:28:02,170 --> 02:28:03,420
Are you going back to London again?

1645
02:28:03,920 --> 02:28:07,210
I have a month's time left right?
I'll go and come back in time for the wedding.

1646
02:28:07,960 --> 02:28:11,840
Arjun, Keerthi and I are getting married.
This is my invite. You have got to come.

1647
02:28:15,540 --> 02:28:19,250
EYYY! What is this nonsense formality?
How many days has it been since we all met?

1648
02:28:19,290 --> 02:28:20,840
Won't you take us out for a dinner at least?

1649
02:28:20,880 --> 02:28:24,710
Oh yeah.. This fellow even suggested a dress pattern.

1650
02:28:24,880 --> 02:28:26,340
Cream color sherwani.

1651
02:28:27,460 --> 02:28:31,170
Oh. So now you're going to buy clothes
for me for your wedding huh?

1652
02:28:34,460 --> 02:28:36,000
Remove that Dr in front of my name.

1653
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:38,670
What happened?

1654
02:28:41,170 --> 02:28:42,630
In my opinion, I believe you are still a doctor.

1655
02:28:43,750 --> 02:28:46,920
You think you're Hippocrates to certify me?

1656
02:28:49,790 --> 02:28:50,460
What happened to him man?

1657
02:28:50,670 --> 02:28:52,420
What do you think I've been telling you
about him all these years?

1658
02:28:52,670 --> 02:28:54,460
This is the first clinical sign of an alcoholic.

1659
02:28:55,210 --> 02:28:57,670
He has no problem with waiters in a bar
or street food vendors.

1660
02:28:57,790 --> 02:28:59,540
But he has a problem with us- his friends and family.

1661
02:28:59,630 --> 02:29:02,540
Look at that device. Who builds such a thing?
What the hell is that thing anyway?

1662
02:29:04,670 --> 02:29:05,670
So what do we do now?

1663
02:29:06,130 --> 02:29:07,000
Move out of the way, I'll go talk to him.

1664
02:29:14,540 --> 02:29:16,170
Have you started smoking beedis now?!

1665
02:29:17,540 --> 02:29:19,090
Whats wrong? They're very nice.

1666
02:29:20,090 --> 02:29:21,840
Did you sell all your stuff because you're broke?

1667
02:29:23,880 --> 02:29:26,130
Yeah, sold them off for your grandfather's funeral.

1668
02:29:26,710 --> 02:29:27,460
You..

1669
02:29:28,460 --> 02:29:29,090
EY! It's hurting.

1670
02:29:30,250 --> 02:29:32,670
If you needed money, you could have asked me couldn't you?

1671
02:29:33,340 --> 02:29:35,750
Here. Take this.
Shiva, dont give me any.

1672
02:29:36,420 --> 02:29:39,000
How many times have I not borrowed any from you?
Think of this in the same way.

1673
02:29:39,130 --> 02:29:41,750
I ate and slept at your house one day right?
Think of this as payment.

1674
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:43,290
This is too much! Take this money!

1675
02:29:57,840 --> 02:30:01,040
Why couldn't you just congratulate him
when he gave you his wedding invite?

1676
02:30:01,540 --> 02:30:03,040
Why are you behaving like this?

1677
02:30:03,420 --> 02:30:05,380
People could think you're being jealous.

1678
02:30:06,130 --> 02:30:12,210
Shiva, you remember my house in Mangalore?
The mattress used to be on the floor sometimes.

1679
02:30:13,170 --> 02:30:14,840
Sometimes on the cot.

1680
02:30:15,290 --> 02:30:17,670
I don't know, ever since Preethi started living there,
I didn't come there much.

1681
02:30:17,750 --> 02:30:21,040
You must have noticed when the maid
would move it aside to clean the floors ?

1682
02:30:21,460 --> 02:30:23,250
I don't know. Maybe. But why do you ask me that now?

1683
02:30:25,840 --> 02:30:30,250
Every time Preethi and I had a small fight,

1684
02:30:31,630 --> 02:30:34,090
we'd have a lot of ego about who should speak first.

1685
02:30:36,250 --> 02:30:38,710
She'd wait and wait and wait
and then lay the mattress on the floor.

1686
02:30:39,840 --> 02:30:43,920
Which meant..she was ready to make love.

1687
02:30:47,790 --> 02:30:48,790
Do you understand?

1688
02:30:49,880 --> 02:30:51,290
You'd probably understand this won't you?

1689
02:30:54,290 --> 02:30:57,210
What more understanding could
there be in a relationship, than this?

1690
02:31:01,040 --> 02:31:04,290
And in this scenario, when things didn't
work out for me, how can he get married?

1691
02:31:04,880 --> 02:31:05,540
Tell me!

1692
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:07,630
You have an answer for everything don't you?

1693
02:31:08,460 --> 02:31:10,790
Alright. Yours is a benchmark lovestory.

1694
02:31:11,880 --> 02:31:13,210
While mine just worked out in fluke.

1695
02:31:14,040 --> 02:31:18,170
When you told him that your marriage
proposal worked, what did he say?

1696
02:31:19,670 --> 02:31:22,880
Mama, good things happen to good
people! Didn't he say that?

1697
02:31:23,090 --> 02:31:24,090
That is exactly what he said.

1698
02:31:24,380 --> 02:31:25,960
But you know what he told me?

1699
02:31:26,920 --> 02:31:29,210
Mama, it's only the good people who suffer in life.

1700
02:31:32,960 --> 02:31:35,170
I always think your happiness' and sadnesses are mine.

1701
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:37,130
Go die, you losers

1702
02:31:38,290 --> 02:31:40,880
Thank goodness,
you don't think our women are yours as well.

1703
02:31:41,380 --> 02:31:44,750
Do you have any shame? This is his state Vidya.

1704
02:31:44,920 --> 02:31:47,920
It's been 7 months since Preethi got married
but he is still living like this.

1705
02:31:49,710 --> 02:31:52,040
EY! Showtime's up. Get out.

1706
02:31:52,750 --> 02:31:54,540
Leave, all of you. Move.

1707
02:31:54,590 --> 02:31:55,380
Arjun!
Go..

1708
02:31:55,630 --> 02:31:56,790
Are you going to attend my marriage or not?

1709
02:31:58,380 --> 02:32:01,420
He won't man. He won't. He didn't attend his
brother's marriage, why will he attend yours?

1710
02:32:01,460 --> 02:32:02,380
Shiva, wait.

1711
02:32:02,920 --> 02:32:04,670
What happened Arjun? Why don't you want to come?

1712
02:32:04,880 --> 02:32:08,920
Vidya, wait. Arjun, I'm asking you for the last time.
Are you going to attend my marriage or not?

1713
02:32:09,090 --> 02:32:09,710
I won't.

1714
02:32:10,880 --> 02:32:12,500
What makes you think you can get a love marriage?

1715
02:32:13,790 --> 02:32:15,710
You're an unworthy candidate for it!

1716
02:32:16,670 --> 02:32:18,000
If you don't come, I won't get married!

1717
02:32:20,790 --> 02:32:22,250
Come, let's drink together. Come come come.

1718
02:32:27,170 --> 02:32:29,540
Kamal.. what are you doing

1719
02:32:29,630 --> 02:32:33,460
You've finally proved that your education and
your background has been completely useless.

1720
02:32:33,840 --> 02:32:35,750
I feel ashamed to call myself your friend.

1721
02:32:36,460 --> 02:32:37,630
Be ashamed then.
What did you say?

1722
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:40,790
Why do you have such a low opinion about him?!

1723
02:32:40,920 --> 02:32:43,880
When we were in college, don't you
remember all those wounds on his arms

1724
02:32:43,920 --> 02:32:45,210
Did he ever tell us about it? At Least once?

1725
02:32:45,750 --> 02:32:49,130
No matter how much Keerthi tortured him,
did he ever come to us and complain?

1726
02:32:49,340 --> 02:32:51,250
He put up with her madness over and over and over

1727
02:32:51,340 --> 02:32:53,590
and now she's managed to convince her
parents to get married to him

1728
02:32:53,670 --> 02:32:55,380
He is a true man! And now look at yourself!

1729
02:32:55,630 --> 02:32:59,920
He's not an unworthy candidate.
You are. Which is why Preethi left you.

1730
02:33:09,170 --> 02:33:09,920
Where is my fridge?

1731
02:33:10,420 --> 02:33:12,840
My AC? Where is all my stuff?

1732
02:33:14,590 --> 02:33:16,000
I read all about you in the newspaper.

1733
02:33:16,540 --> 02:33:19,750
Get out of here. If you stay here one more minute,
I will complain to the police!

1734
02:33:30,670 --> 02:33:32,670
I will show you a spot, you sleep there tonight.

1735
02:33:34,250 --> 02:33:36,000
I'll look for another one by tomorrow.

1736
02:33:37,340 --> 02:33:39,880
Sleep here, I'll come tomorrow morning. Alright?

1737
02:33:53,590 --> 02:33:54,340
Brother! Money?

1738
02:33:54,960 --> 02:33:56,630
Shut up! Write that into my account.

1739
02:34:02,460 --> 02:34:03,880
What headache is this , early in the morning?

1740
02:34:06,590 --> 02:34:07,880
Brother!

1741
02:34:14,090 --> 02:34:17,380
Brother! Did you see a guy with
a beard walking his dog around here?

1742
02:34:18,960 --> 02:34:22,590
Excuse me brother! Did you see a guy
with a beard walking his dog around here?

1743
02:34:23,380 --> 02:34:24,170
You didn't?

1744
02:34:27,170 --> 02:34:33,130
There will be such a day in your life.
Just like Rajkumar and Vyjayanthimala.

1745
02:34:37,130 --> 02:34:43,210
Song Humming

1746
02:34:54,790 --> 02:34:56,590
What the hell are you doing here?

1747
02:34:57,130 --> 02:35:00,630
I've been roaming the streets everywhere,
asking people if they saw a bearded guy with a dog!

1748
02:35:01,630 --> 02:35:02,630
Ey, get out of here!

1749
02:35:04,340 --> 02:35:04,880
Get out.

1750
02:35:09,380 --> 02:35:10,380
Listen...grandma's dead.

1751
02:35:11,790 --> 02:35:15,040
Get up. Everybody's waiting. Let's go.

1752
02:35:36,250 --> 02:35:36,840
Arjun!

1753
02:35:37,750 --> 02:35:41,710
Is this when you come! My sister...
died early in the morning. In her sleep.

1754
02:35:42,960 --> 02:35:44,420
Go, go inside and see her.

1755
02:36:34,460 --> 02:36:35,090
Dad!

1756
02:36:37,340 --> 02:36:37,960
Dad!

1757
02:36:40,790 --> 02:36:42,170
Why are you sitting here Dad?

1758
02:36:46,540 --> 02:36:48,170
Dad, I can understand how you feel.

1759
02:36:51,500 --> 02:36:56,210
You're the one who grieves the most for Grandma.

1760
02:36:58,500 --> 02:36:59,880
I came here only to see you.

1761
02:37:03,880 --> 02:37:07,090
We don't even think that such a day as this
would come by sometime, don't we?

1762
02:37:08,920 --> 02:37:10,090
How funny is this!

1763
02:37:12,040 --> 02:37:12,540
Dad!

1764
02:37:14,840 --> 02:37:21,670
Being born, being in love and then dying..
These are just 10% of the important moments in our life.

1765
02:37:22,840 --> 02:37:25,170
The rest are just reactions to these moments.

1766
02:37:27,090 --> 02:37:28,790
Dont sit here like this Daddy,

1767
02:37:30,920 --> 02:37:32,630
this is an important moment in your life.

1768
02:37:34,250 --> 02:37:36,790
There are a lot of people waiting to meet you inside

1769
02:37:37,630 --> 02:37:39,880
Dad! Please Dad! Let's go inside.

1770
02:37:40,380 --> 02:37:41,380
Get up Dad!

1771
02:37:42,420 --> 02:37:43,170
Get up Dad!

1772
02:37:43,840 --> 02:37:44,840
Please get up Dad!

1773
02:38:11,840 --> 02:38:13,090
Grandma's favourite song.

1774
02:38:36,590 --> 02:38:38,380
Be careful with the body!

1775
02:38:38,710 --> 02:38:39,840
Who the bloody called this a “body”?

1776
02:38:42,710 --> 02:38:43,710
Arjun

1777
02:39:28,500 --> 02:39:28,960
No..

1778
02:39:29,500 --> 02:39:32,210
I had this habit, long long ago in college. Been a long time.

1779
02:39:34,290 --> 02:39:36,960
Arjun, there is a saying in English.

1780
02:39:44,130 --> 02:39:46,090
I think the time has come for you to understand this.

1781
02:39:48,170 --> 02:39:49,170
Daddy, I'm sorry.

1782
02:39:50,880 --> 02:39:52,750
I will stop all these bad habits from today.

1783
02:40:09,040 --> 02:40:10,130
What are you thinking about?

1784
02:40:10,670 --> 02:40:12,130
You shouldn't be this way for a long time.

1785
02:40:12,670 --> 02:40:14,590
Once you come back from your trip,
we'll begin work on your marriage.

1786
02:40:16,840 --> 02:40:17,540
Take a U-turn.

1787
02:41:55,540 --> 02:42:04,460
The breathe is suddenly stopping so

1788
02:42:07,290 --> 02:42:16,040
I am going spell bound seeing you so

1789
02:42:18,960 --> 02:42:25,710
Your thought does not leave like a shackle unbreakable

1790
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:33,290
The wants with no borders have become more

1791
02:42:33,750 --> 02:42:42,500
How did this incomparable and
unidentified become a bonding?

1792
02:42:43,130 --> 02:42:51,920
It is become a vacuum either
I see opening the eyes or close, how?

1793
02:42:54,000 --> 02:43:11,750
My steps have stumbled,
which shore would this journey reach?

1794
02:43:12,710 --> 02:43:25,630
This time has done a mistake by
separating you and me

1795
02:44:03,750 --> 02:44:12,380
Why has a new disturbance landed in this heart today?

1796
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:21,960
Sorrow has owned up and may not leave and go like a shadow

1797
02:44:22,840 --> 02:44:24,170
Did you give me the right address?

1798
02:44:24,750 --> 02:44:31,090
Maybe no way out to stop in this magical path

1799
02:44:31,790 --> 02:44:40,460
Maybe time is running all this
and maybe this is the death

1800
02:44:41,590 --> 02:44:43,590
Silence and vacuum have covered me and you completely

1801
02:44:43,670 --> 02:44:48,290
Won't you call me once after coming to Europe? Huh?
The city I live in is two hours from here.

1802
02:44:49,210 --> 02:44:52,210
You don't answer your phone.
What are you doing here man?

1803
02:44:53,460 --> 02:44:55,710
What are you doing here with
your wedding slated in three days?

1804
02:44:59,380 --> 02:45:00,840
Come. Let's go inside. Kamal?

1805
02:45:06,090 --> 02:45:06,500
Kamal..

1806
02:45:06,790 --> 02:45:08,000
Yes, tell me.

1807
02:45:10,630 --> 02:45:12,340
I saw Preethi on my way to Italy.

1808
02:45:14,920 --> 02:45:21,750
She's a woman now. With an 8 month old stomach.

1809
02:45:23,630 --> 02:45:24,130
So?

1810
02:45:24,590 --> 02:45:25,590
She isn't happy.

1811
02:45:26,840 --> 02:45:27,840
That is for sure.

1812
02:45:29,680 --> 02:45:30,800
I will ask her to come away with me.

1813
02:45:31,180 --> 02:45:31,970
You think she will if you ask her?

1814
02:45:32,470 --> 02:45:33,090
She will.

1815
02:45:34,220 --> 02:45:37,720
She is my girl. I am not happy, she's not happy.

1816
02:45:39,090 --> 02:45:40,340
How can you tell that she's not happy?

1817
02:45:40,800 --> 02:45:44,390
I saw her and I could understand.
Don't you know if Keerthi is upset?

1818
02:45:44,890 --> 02:45:48,470
Alright. She got married without her consent.
What about her pregnancy then?

1819
02:45:48,930 --> 02:45:51,010
Yes, she's pregnant so what?

1820
02:45:51,340 --> 02:45:52,180
What do you mean so what?

1821
02:45:52,720 --> 02:45:55,800
She is my girl, man! Same girl, same Preethi!

1822
02:45:56,140 --> 02:45:58,180
Marriage and pregnancy doesn't change a thing.

1823
02:45:58,760 --> 02:46:00,970
Alright. Now you need to take
permission not from her dad,

1824
02:46:01,470 --> 02:46:02,510
but from her husband.

1825
02:46:03,300 --> 02:46:04,090
Who is he to permit?

1826
02:46:04,470 --> 02:46:05,050
What do you mean 'who is he to permit?'

1827
02:46:09,050 --> 02:46:10,390
Arjun do you understand what you are saying?

1828
02:46:10,890 --> 02:46:12,510
I'm going back to Hyderabad tonight.

1829
02:46:12,930 --> 02:46:14,890
Back then, she got married when I wasn't in my senses.

1830
02:46:16,010 --> 02:46:18,800
Now I'm completely conscious.
There is now way I'm letting her go.

1831
02:46:18,970 --> 02:46:20,890
But this decision will cause
you a lot of problems in the future man!

1832
02:46:21,180 --> 02:46:21,840
Yes!

1833
02:46:23,090 --> 02:46:24,760
I'll take care of them.

1834
02:46:28,050 --> 02:46:30,930
But, all these months, when I am not happy,
how can she be happy?

1835
02:46:32,640 --> 02:46:34,510
I was angry because she got married.

1836
02:46:36,390 --> 02:46:36,930
That is it.

1837
02:46:38,550 --> 02:46:39,890
I will come to your marriage Kamal.

1838
02:46:41,760 --> 02:46:42,930
I will bring Preethi along with me.

1839
02:47:13,300 --> 02:47:14,470
Driver, stop here to the left!

1840
02:47:39,800 --> 02:47:43,090
Listen! It's been 9 months since she got married!

1841
02:47:43,970 --> 02:47:45,590
Her system is completely different now.

1842
02:47:46,140 --> 02:47:47,550
Don't jump on her and talk to her, like you did earlier.

1843
02:47:48,260 --> 02:47:51,180
You see those women there? They will kick you this time.

1844
02:48:06,070 --> 02:48:07,280
Preethi, I need to talk to you.

1845
02:48:10,030 --> 02:48:11,240
Preethi, I need to talk to you.

1846
02:48:12,440 --> 02:48:13,530
Preethi..are you listen me

1847
02:48:36,360 --> 02:48:39,740
Preethi, I need to talk to you.

1848
02:48:43,610 --> 02:48:45,150
Preethi, I came here to talk to you!

1849
02:48:47,940 --> 02:48:48,690
Baby..please.

1850
02:48:52,110 --> 02:48:53,280
Baby, look at me once!

1851
02:48:56,610 --> 02:48:58,990
Amma, can you give me some water?

1852
02:49:09,820 --> 02:49:10,320
Preethi..

1853
02:49:12,780 --> 02:49:14,150
Preethi, please look here once.

1854
02:49:17,530 --> 02:49:18,650
I have to talk to you.

1855
02:49:20,780 --> 02:49:22,690
Alright, fine, don't talk to me, but just listen to me.

1856
02:49:27,530 --> 02:49:31,570
What should I listen? What should I say now?

1857
02:49:32,860 --> 02:49:34,530
I spoke to you for such a long time that day!

1858
02:49:35,320 --> 02:49:38,690
Did you listen to me? Anyway,
why did you even come now?

1859
02:49:40,030 --> 02:49:41,490
Go away Arjun. Go.

1860
02:49:42,900 --> 02:49:44,190
I didn't come here to go away Preethi.

1861
02:49:46,030 --> 02:49:47,780
I've come here to take you with me.

1862
02:49:48,940 --> 02:49:50,240
Do you have any shame?

1863
02:49:51,570 --> 02:49:53,780
That is all immateria..

1864
02:49:54,440 --> 02:49:55,860
Baby, what is all this baby?

1865
02:49:56,940 --> 02:50:00,440
We are not happy.
You come with me. We'll live together.

1866
02:50:03,570 --> 02:50:05,990
How can you decide whether I am happy or not?

1867
02:50:06,150 --> 02:50:09,490
We can't be apart and be happy
at the same time. I know this.

1868
02:50:11,030 --> 02:50:11,900
I'm fine.

1869
02:50:13,820 --> 02:50:17,070
I curse you to get marry a thulu guy

1870
02:50:18,780 --> 02:50:20,820
What else? Everything turned out like you said it would.

1871
02:50:21,530 --> 02:50:22,570
Go away Arjun. Go.

1872
02:50:23,400 --> 02:50:26,650
Baby, don't just keep saying go go go all the time.
Come, lets go.

1873
02:50:27,740 --> 02:50:29,820
You gave me 6 hours time that day didn't you?

1874
02:50:31,820 --> 02:50:32,530
That was it?

1875
02:50:34,240 --> 02:50:35,690
Is that how you'd leave me?

1876
02:50:37,690 --> 02:50:39,940
Women have restrictions at home Arjun.

1877
02:50:42,030 --> 02:50:44,440
But you don't have any sisters do you?
You won't understand.

1878
02:50:46,990 --> 02:50:49,030
I came to your house that night.

1879
02:50:50,030 --> 02:50:52,610
I waited hoping you'd come.

1880
02:50:54,030 --> 02:50:54,820
When did you come?

1881
02:50:55,780 --> 02:50:57,820
After everything was over. 2 days later.

1882
02:50:58,280 --> 02:51:00,940
What did you do until then? Did you sleep?

1883
02:51:02,360 --> 02:51:04,150
He had no idea that you came that night.

1884
02:51:04,440 --> 02:51:06,490
Promise. I told him about this a few days ago.

1885
02:51:06,860 --> 02:51:10,150
Because you didn't call him, he went crazy
and injected himself with morphine.

1886
02:51:10,360 --> 02:51:11,360
And overdosed on it.

1887
02:51:14,440 --> 02:51:15,820
He woke up after 2 days.

1888
02:51:16,190 --> 02:51:19,490
And in the meanwhile, your marriage, his brother's marriage.
all of this happened so quickly.

1889
02:51:20,360 --> 02:51:23,280
The minute he woke up, he learnt about your marriage.
And was in front of you the next moment.

1890
02:51:23,860 --> 02:51:25,740
His Dad kicked him out of his house.

1891
02:51:26,530 --> 02:51:28,190
He lived alone, while working in the hospital.

1892
02:51:28,650 --> 02:51:30,820
He went back home when his grandmother died recently.

1893
02:51:31,610 --> 02:51:33,440
I am telling you all these things
because you need to know!

1894
02:51:34,190 --> 02:51:35,820
Because he'd never tell you these things, otherwise.

1895
02:51:36,320 --> 02:51:38,570
Ill leave you both to your conversation,
I won't disturb you anymore.

1896
02:51:44,440 --> 02:51:49,190
That day, despite me travelling so far to see you,
you didn't even turn around to look at me.

1897
02:51:50,570 --> 02:51:53,570
How far? Was that as far as the Himalayas?

1898
02:51:54,320 --> 02:51:55,860
Banjara Hills to Marredpally.

1899
02:51:56,690 --> 02:51:57,690
Why should I have turned around?

1900
02:51:58,570 --> 02:52:00,360
But why did you come anyway? To get beaten?

1901
02:52:00,650 --> 02:52:03,820
ust go away Arjun!
Preethi calm down please.

1902
02:52:06,150 --> 02:52:06,690
Alright.

1903
02:52:08,320 --> 02:52:10,030
I won't show my face to you ever again,

1904
02:52:12,400 --> 02:52:15,610
but I'm just going to ask
you one last question. Give me an answer.

1905
02:52:16,940 --> 02:52:17,530
Ask

1906
02:52:18,860 --> 02:52:20,780
What is stopping you now to come away with me?

1907
02:52:26,530 --> 02:52:27,110
Is that it?

1908
02:52:34,860 --> 02:52:35,440
Oh is it?

1909
02:52:37,440 --> 02:52:38,490
Preethi, believe me.

1910
02:52:40,110 --> 02:52:41,150
I will handle things.

1911
02:52:41,190 --> 02:52:44,530
I will handle things. I'll take care of all
this- these families, friends, society.

1912
02:52:45,570 --> 02:52:49,030
Don't think about this anymore Preethi.
Come away with me, Preethi.

1913
02:52:49,570 --> 02:52:54,940
Alright. If I come with you now,
when this baby is born, who do I tell is his father?

1914
02:52:55,070 --> 02:52:55,820
Show me to the baby.

1915
02:53:00,110 --> 02:53:00,530
Tell..

1916
02:53:05,240 --> 02:53:08,440
Why do you need all this now? You have your heroine.

1917
02:53:08,860 --> 02:53:10,900
You have your liquor to forget people.

1918
02:53:11,360 --> 02:53:13,190
You have even habituated drugs for yourself haven't you?

1919
02:53:13,490 --> 02:53:14,320
Go die, just like that.

1920
02:53:14,690 --> 02:53:16,650
Preethi, there was nothing between the both of them.

1921
02:53:16,780 --> 02:53:17,780
Ey stop talking Shiva.

1922
02:53:23,070 --> 02:53:24,400
Preethi do you want me to go talk to him?

1923
02:53:26,900 --> 02:53:28,440
You tell me. Do you want me to go convince him?

1924
02:53:29,650 --> 02:53:32,650
I will go talk to him. Tell me Preethi,

1925
02:53:33,740 --> 02:53:36,900
I will go talk to him and come back.

1926
02:53:38,360 --> 02:53:40,240
Just nod your head, I'll go right away.

1927
02:53:46,190 --> 02:53:46,690
Come here.

1928
02:53:48,860 --> 02:53:49,490
Come here.

1929
02:53:57,320 --> 02:53:58,070
Sit here.

1930
02:54:26,610 --> 02:54:29,900
Baby! How have been all these days, without me?

1931
02:54:31,650 --> 02:54:32,360
Tell me?

1932
02:54:35,190 --> 02:54:37,490
I left that place on the third day of my marriage.

1933
02:54:38,110 --> 02:54:40,190
I didn't feel like coming to you at all.

1934
02:54:45,780 --> 02:54:47,860
I didn't even visit my parents.

1935
02:54:48,690 --> 02:54:51,440
I've been living in a hostel while working in a clinic.

1936
02:54:52,650 --> 02:54:57,280
My anger subsided after a few days.
I thought of getting back to you.

1937
02:54:57,780 --> 02:55:01,400
And then, I skipped my periods.
I got to know that I was pregnant.

1938
02:55:02,280 --> 02:55:04,280
And then I had no inclination to see you.

1939
02:55:06,150 --> 02:55:09,110
A few days later, I wanted to see you again.

1940
02:55:09,780 --> 02:55:12,940
But then I read about your affair with
that heroine in the newspaper.

1941
02:55:13,990 --> 02:55:18,570
I waited all these days, hoping
that you'd come searching for me.

1942
02:55:21,610 --> 02:55:22,280
Arjun..

1943
02:55:23,610 --> 02:55:26,320
I didn't let my husband touch at least my little finger.

1944
02:55:36,400 --> 02:55:38,070
Now listen to me clearly.

1945
02:55:38,820 --> 02:55:40,360
I am telling you Arjun..

1946
02:55:41,570 --> 02:55:43,150
This is your baby.

1947
02:56:01,360 --> 02:56:06,400
I thought of telling this so many times.
But I've never told anyone about this.

1948
02:56:11,690 --> 02:56:12,490
Tell me.

1949
02:56:52,280 --> 02:56:56,110
This girl has no one in her life.
Not even a family that meets her.

1950
02:56:57,610 --> 02:56:59,030
Maybe she's an orphan.

1951
02:57:00,570 --> 02:57:02,440
That is how people used to think of me.

1952
02:57:03,320 --> 02:57:06,610
But that lady over there took care of everything for me.

1953
02:57:23,280 --> 02:57:24,280
Thank you very much aunty.

1954
02:57:25,610 --> 02:57:29,280
There was not a single day that girl didn't cry.
Take good care of herself my boy.

1955
02:57:40,320 --> 02:57:42,320
I thought of never forgiving you, not in this life

1956
02:57:44,030 --> 02:57:46,030
But when you came and stood before me,

1957
02:57:46,820 --> 02:57:49,740
anger worth 9 months of my life
couldn't last for more than 9 minutes.

1958
02:57:55,440 --> 02:57:58,530
Arjun, marry me.

1959
02:57:59,110 --> 02:58:00,440
Today, right now.

1960
02:58:02,280 --> 02:58:15,110
Your remembrances filled in the heart
have become my breathe all these days

1961
02:58:17,280 --> 02:58:28,780
Your face I filled in my eyes became
pacification all these days

1962
02:58:29,440 --> 02:58:38,530
Let me say that heart cannot withstand your separation

1963
02:58:39,820 --> 02:58:47,030
Let the unsatisfied wish be fulfilled

1964
02:58:48,070 --> 02:59:00,150
Your remembrances filled in the heart
have become my breathe all these days

1965
02:59:00,570 --> 02:59:13,400
Let my life feel happy joining feet in your steps
Let me be satisfied getting along with you

1966
02:59:14,360 --> 02:59:25,400
Let me become your shadow not
leaving in any turn of the path

1967
02:59:25,780 --> 02:59:30,150
New mornings clearing the darkness

1968
02:59:30,190 --> 02:59:34,440
When life missing out reaches back its shore

1969
02:59:34,690 --> 02:59:42,030
When a pleasant sweet rain poured so in the smile

1970
02:59:42,650 --> 02:59:49,190
By telling it all filled in my heart today

1971
02:59:50,070 --> 02:59:57,940
Im sorry I didn't realise how pure
you people were for each other.

1972
02:59:59,320 --> 03:00:00,440
I couldn't see it, its my mistake, forgive me.

1973
03:00:07,150 --> 03:00:10,530
I have not come here to separate you again.

1974
03:00:12,320 --> 03:00:13,570
God bless you, stay blessed my dear child.

1975
03:00:16,190 --> 03:00:22,860
Everything now is a hug driving away the distance

1976
03:00:24,820 --> 03:00:33,650
When shown all the love filled in the heart today

1977
03:00:37,110 --> 03:00:45,360
Let this world be lost in the smiles
making the separation into trance

1978
03:00:45,650 --> 03:00:53,650
Heart is a garden of flowers as hopes
to become as better halves

1979
03:00:54,190 --> 03:00:58,240
Let the tides sing lullabies and drive away the tiredness

1980
03:00:58,440 --> 03:01:02,400
Let dreams become true getting into your lap

1981
03:01:02,490 --> 03:01:09,650
When the heaven is reached in the rainbow formed

1982
03:01:10,440 --> 03:01:19,860
When shown all the love filled in the heart today

1983
03:01:22,690 --> 03:01:26,530
I told you a 100 times not to plan a beachside
program when the baby's around. Do you listen to me?

1984
03:01:26,610 --> 03:01:30,110
I must have told you 200 times that if I grew
my moustache, Id seem like you're father.

1985
03:01:30,530 --> 03:01:31,240
I grew them, didn't I?

1986
03:01:31,320 --> 03:01:38,940
Everything now is a hug driving away the distance

1987
03:01:39,440 --> 03:01:44,030
When shown all the love filled in the heart today
