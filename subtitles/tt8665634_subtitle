1
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:24,291
I thought the tests had
gone well this time.

2
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:25,750
But you still flunked
nevertheless.

3
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:29,000
Aunt, I think some professor has
a personal vendetta with me.

4
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:31,875
Right.
Like you two are archenemies?

5
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:34,916
And by the way,
you flunked in every subject.

6
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:36,791
They gang up against me.

7
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:39,041
I've been telling you for two years

8
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:40,708
to send me to Chandigarh.

9
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:42,583
Tell me if I don't clear the
tests in first division.

10
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:44,250
Why don't we send you
to London instead?

11
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:47,125
Look at his neckerchief,
as if he is some senior officer.

12
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:48,916
Forget it, brother.

13
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:50,833
Let's not educate him.

14
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:53,125
Let's get him married next year.

15
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:12,250
No, Hardev.

16
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:13,750
Let him complete his education.

17
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,583
He can get married
after two years.

18
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,583
Don't worry, son.
We will send you to Chandigarh.

19
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:21,541
Okay? Let's go. He doesn't
bother about anything.

20
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:23,000
Let's go and watch
some television.

21
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,583
Yes, go and watch cartoon. I have
a liquor bottle kept there.

22
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:27,916
Don't you dare drink a swig
and replace it water.

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,333
What are you still doing here?

24
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:30,625
How about serving some
refreshments to your in-laws?

25
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,708
Chinda, get some fritters.

26
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,083
Brother-in-law,
you are going to Chandigarh.

27
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:42,125
Now what about my sister?

28
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:43,916
Don't worry, sister-in-law.

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,208
I am going to Chandigarh
to check out the girls.

30
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,958
She is the one I am going
to get married to.

31
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,666
She used to smile at
me at your wedding.

32
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,916
You two sisters can
work together here.

33
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,083
If I get someone else
then you two...

34
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:55,916
will always cuss each other.

35
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:02,625
Tea?

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,750
No, you serve it outside.
I'll take some from my sister.

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,375
Take it, Aman. It's being polite.

38
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:17,500
<span style="style.default_1">Your dress is worth 700 and</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Jewelry's worth 2600</span>

39
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:20,333
Ask sister-in-law what dress
is she going to wear.

40
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,458
Sit tight, son.

41
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:11,708
Don't fall off and cause
trouble for me.

42
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,708
There is no lack of beauty
in this city.

43
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,458
One is better than the other.

44
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:19,916
The best of Punjab,
Haryana and Himachal come here.

45
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:23,750
When you look at one,
you miss three others.

46
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,250
So, don't act stupid.

47
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:06,208
1147?

48
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,041
Is it the ground floor
or the top floor?

49
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:12,291
Brother,
it is written over there.

50
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:27,125
Do you really think
I didn't read it?

51
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,583
-Here.
-He's too eager.

52
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,500
He thinks he's some big shot.

53
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:48,375
Look,
I don't entertain strangers.

54
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,750
Brother Titu had called.

55
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:53,333
You know him, right? That's why.

56
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,625
I don't care if I get less rent.

57
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,333
Change this note.

58
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And get this straight.

59
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:05,916
You can't get your friends
or girls into my house.

60
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:09,125
-Cousin sister can come over, right?
-Cousin sister?

61
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,625
You have come from Malout.

62
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,333
And you know everything
about cousin sisters?

63
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:13,791
Do you have a cousin sister?

64
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,416
Go and find another
house to stay in.

65
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:18,083
No auntie, I was just asking for
general knowledge's sake.

66
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,291
Auntie?

67
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,500
If I hadn't gotten
married early...

68
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,083
you would've been following
me on your Enfield.

69
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:24,916
You won't address me as sister.

70
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,708
Fine, you can address me as
sister-in-law. That's your room.

71
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,208
Don't smile.

72
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:33,333
I might be your sister-in-law,
but not when it comes to money.

73
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,666
Make sure you lock the gate
when you come or leave.

74
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,291
Bani?

75
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,333
What's wrong, dear?

76
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,291
Tell me, what's wrong.

77
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,375
Bani?

78
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,166
Tell me, please?

79
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,083
-All of a sudden?
-Your parents are out of town, right?

80
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:16,583
So, I brought breakfast for you.

81
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,291
Come here. It's hot and fresh.

82
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,833
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

83
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:25,000
-You didn't like my surprise?
-No.

84
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:27,291
I mean I liked it. Yes.

85
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,833
You didn't tell me...

86
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:56,416
I...

87
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:01,375
Bani!

88
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:30,541
Bani, you had asked me to
keep a modern outlook.

89
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:33,083
And I agreed.

90
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:37,416
Now you know why I used
to tell you otherwise.

91
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:42,166
Look dear, you are not as
experienced at this age...

92
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,125
to know what is wrong
and right for you.

93
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,291
That's why, our elders used
to fix our marriages.

94
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:50,958
How is this my fault?

95
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:52,333
That...

96
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,625
He cheated me.

97
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,458
You go and beat him up
at the police station.

98
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,833
Now am I good only for that?

99
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,750
Fine.

100
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,875
Then I won't have dinner.

101
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,291
All fathers with daughters
beat boys up.

102
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,333
It is your fault.

103
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:13,708
You were being stubborn.

104
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,333
You wouldn't have
to say anything...

105
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,125
if anything had happened
against your wishes.

106
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:29,500
<span style="style.default_1">You must have read many books...</span>

107
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,625
Here you go.

108
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,166
Do it properly. Do it again.

109
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,333
Are you new to this colony?

110
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,041
Yes, to study.

111
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,041
I think you are here to teach.

112
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:09,375
Stop your nonsense. It's nothing.

113
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:10,791
Mind your own business.

114
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:19,000
-I want tuition for all subjects.
-This is the class.

115
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,708
What's wrong?

116
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:35,541
I didn't like the way you teach.

117
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,083
Give me some more of this.

118
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,000
Give me some more of this water.

119
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:54,208
Hold on. Don't make your
stomach burst from it.

120
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:57,000
There will always be
girls coming here.

121
00:12:57,083 --> 00:13:00,166
Why don't you just take up the
job of cleaning plates here?

122
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,291
I will pay you 450 rupees a month.

123
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:06,041
-Should I tell you?
-Why are you getting upset?

124
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,958
-You can take 650 instead.
-I don't know about the girls.

125
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,750
But I'd enjoy beating you up.
Do you understand?

126
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,208
I'm loaded and he's
wants to pay me.

127
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,750
Papa, Enfield.

128
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,208
Brother, Enfield?

129
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:38,583
Thrashing.

130
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:40,083
Thrashing.

131
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,041
Run! Run!

132
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,958
I knew this would happen.

133
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,791
Why are the kids so
scared of you?

134
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:30,041
You should give their ball back.

135
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:31,583
Do you want to open
a shop of ball?

136
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,958
If any of them end up being
like Yuvraj or Kohli...

137
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,333
then they will show your
house on television.

138
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,583
They aren't scared of me.
They are scared of my mother.

139
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,958
<span style="style.default_1">Right. Why would anyone</span>
<span style="style.default_1">be scared of you?</span>

140
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:46,000
<span style="style.default_1">I can understand what you are</span>
<span style="style.default_1">trying to say with your eyes.</span>

141
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,500
<span style="style.default_1">I just praised you.</span>

142
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,250
<span style="style.default_1">It's not like I cussed.</span>

143
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,166
<span style="style.default_1">It is not needed.</span>

144
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,750
Can you make these over there,
on my rooftop?

145
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,791
These flowers?
Or draw a Ford?

146
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:01,791
No, not Ford. Draw a green
John Deere.

147
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,458
I'll get the paints for you.

148
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,250
I can make lamps too.

149
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:14,083
<span style="style.default_1">You are like a lamp.</span>

150
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,125
If you work just as
hard on fields...

151
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:22,000
you would get a yield
of around 40 quintals.

152
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,916
Aunt,
these kids are a form of God.

153
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,500
You are not like your neighbor.

154
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:37,250
-She is a crazy woman.
-You should return the ball.

155
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,500
If any of them end up being like
Yuvraj or Virat Kohli...

156
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:41,125
then they will show your house.

157
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:49,375
Son, they play here on purpose.

158
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:51,125
Can't they play on the ground?

159
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:53,375
Really? Then you know better.

160
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,291
I saw some boys outside,
wasting fuel, riding Enfield.

161
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,833
Papa had called.
He said buy yourself an Enfield.

162
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,916
I said, I am here to study
and not go on drives.

163
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,333
And I always have a
book in my hand.

164
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,791
A few lessons learnt with
tea can do you no harm.

165
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,458
Auntie, do you know how
to use a computer?

166
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,041
Auntie, do you have a calendar
with horoscope in it?

167
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:19,041
<span style="style.default_1">Leave.</span>

168
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,291
-<span style="style.default_1">Why?</span>
-<span style="style.default_1">Because I said so.</span>

169
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,000
<span style="style.default_1">What you say doesn't matter.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">It's auntie who served me tea.</span>

170
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:28,541
<span style="style.default_1">Okay, you might even want</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to have lunch here then.</span>

171
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:35,291
Auntie, please don't mind, but
you are under my oath...

172
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,250
you should lock the door when
you sit down for lunch.

173
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:38,666
The delicious fragrance
of your food kills me.

174
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,208
I have not had a decent meal
since the time I came here.

175
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,958
I don't know what she cooks. She
adds water while making okra.

176
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:48,625
She makes veggies
with gravy in it.

177
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,666
It's okay, son.
You can have lunch here today.

178
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,208
Forget her. She is an idiot.

179
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:10,166
-What were you doing?
-Nothing, I was sleeping.

180
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:13,708
-With whom?
-Alone, I swear on you.

181
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,000
Swear on your mother.

182
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,708
You are sleeping in peace after
giving me sleepless nights?

183
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,208
-Please listen to me, Bani.
-Shut up and listen to me.

184
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,833
You followed me like a
dog for three years.

185
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,375
Did your father ask you to?

186
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,541
I fought with my family for you.

187
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:29,583
What do you think we girls are?

188
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,750
I won't spare you. I will...

189
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:40,375
Great!

190
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:42,958
He disconnected my call!
How daring!

191
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:44,500
He used to call me
20 times a day.

192
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,083
Now he is disconnecting my call.

193
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,041
How can anyone do this?

194
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:49,791
What will you say?

195
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,458
Listen to me carefully, okay?

196
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:56,000
How dare you disconnect her call!

197
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,791
You used to call me
20 times in a day.

198
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,125
What is your problem now?

199
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:03,875
-Who am I? I am her boyfriend, not you.
-She had left you.

200
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,333
Do you understand?
Do you think you are Gary Sandhu?

201
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:07,875
Get lost! Disappear!

202
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:19,875
Who asked you to be the hero?

203
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,083
The one who makes an entrance...

204
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,208
after the girl breaks
up is called the hero.

205
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,166
Should I call sister-in-law
Anmol?

206
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:28,583
Sister-in-law doesn't
like to drink.

207
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:35,125
Drink it.
You deserve one after a breakup.

208
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,125
You are very concerned
about my breakup.

209
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,208
-Will you beat him up?
-For whom?

210
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,958
The one who doesn't even
greet me properly?

211
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,916
Why are you worried
about the breakup?

212
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:52,875
Its boys who get worried
as to how...

213
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:54,083
will they find the next one.

214
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,083
You look okay.

215
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,416
You must be fine
otherwise as well.

216
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,000
Must be?

217
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,416
What do you mean by must be?

218
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:11,166
I am a decent boy. I don't
look at girls in that way.

219
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:16,416
And that reminds me, I am single.

220
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,750
I mean,
I don't have a girlfriend.

221
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:21,291
Really?

222
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,416
Anything else?

223
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,791
No, it is not your fault.

224
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:26,791
You are not from the city.

225
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,916
You have a girl living
your neighborhood...

226
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,083
who is hot and beautiful.

227
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,791
She just had a breakup.

228
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:34,333
She is all alone on the
roof at one o'clock...

229
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,166
sitting with you,
without her parent's knowledge.

230
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,500
Anyone will have a good
feeling about it.

231
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,583
I won't give a second glance
to someone like you.

232
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:42,666
Do you understand?

233
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,583
What is so funny?

234
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:53,333
Hey?

235
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,875
Really.

236
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,000
I have no interest.

237
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:02,333
Hey, nothing can happen.

238
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,166
Nothing at all.

239
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,250
Stop laughing.

240
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,625
I am not that kind of a girl.

241
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,750
My papa says that all
boys are the same.

242
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,291
What if you are just the same?

243
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:36,625
What I am,
I am right in front of you.

244
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:39,625
And you cannot compare the price
of peanuts and almonds.

245
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:42,041
Can we get some water, please?

246
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:43,125
Okay, sir.

247
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:46,791
Bani,
I want to dwell in your eyes.

248
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,333
No.

249
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,875
I want to be a throne on your head.

250
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,125
You mean the crown, stupid.

251
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:54,750
But keep going.

252
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:57,458
-Did you look at his face?
-I know everything about boys.

253
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:58,791
They can leave the girl.

254
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:01,333
But they cannot tolerate to
see her with anyone else.

255
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:02,916
Laugh.

256
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:06,166
-Sir.
-You are very cute.

257
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:08,375
Take our order, man.

258
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:12,916
-Okay.
-Bani, what did you see in me?

259
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:16,708
What was it?

260
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,375
Tractor?

261
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,666
Yes!

262
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,291
When you tie a blue turban,
you look like Ford.

263
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,625
When you tie a green turban,
you look like John Deere.

264
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:30,750
Amazing.

265
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:36,333
Then I am like the land,
who cannot do without a tractor.

266
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:38,166
You praise just like Galib.

267
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,000
That was an amazing, couplet.
Very good.

268
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,458
Bani, will you please
listen to me?

269
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:43,875
I am here for her.

270
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:45,791
You take our order.

271
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:48,291
Okay.

272
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:53,916
Get us a serving of mixed snacks.

273
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:57,041
And listen...

274
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,458
And a cold drink with two straws.

275
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:03,166
-Something else.
-No, wait.

276
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:05,583
Get a coffee instead.

277
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,250
Draw a nice heart on it, okay?

278
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:10,833
Just one.

279
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,291
Bani, I am such a nice person...

280
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:22,250
that I don't even feel
like breaking its heart.

281
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:24,541
You know the one who breaks
hearts gets worms in his stomach.

282
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:26,291
-Really?
-Like the worms that feed on cotton.

283
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:28,125
They cannot be killed
by pesticides either.

284
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:30,166
Bani,
I don't want to break a heart.

285
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,708
Let's go?
We'll go and have a soft serve.

286
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:33,083
Let's go.

287
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:37,208
Come on.

288
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:40,750
Move your hand.

289
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:42,916
By pretending to be
my fake boyfriend...

290
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
are you trying to hit on me?

291
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:47,666
No, the closer I get the more
jealous he will feel.

292
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:50,291
-Bani, I told you what a nice person I am.
-Really?

293
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:52,125
I'll prove it.

294
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:53,250
Come, let's go.

295
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:02,125
I have never in my life said such
stupid things, you know.

296
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,416
I had fun.

297
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:10,583
You were dating a waiter?

298
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,208
Are you stupid?
He's doing an internship there.

299
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:14,875
By the way, why are you here?

300
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:17,000
To complete my graduation.

301
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,958
-You are a first-year student?
-No, I'm in my final year.

302
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:22,625
Oh! You are two years younger
than me, you know?

303
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:24,333
I'm in the final year
of my degree.

304
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:27,250
No, I have flunked a few times.

305
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:31,625
A few times? You don't even
remember how many times you flunked?

306
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:33,416
Hey,
who wants to remember failure?

307
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,250
Who knows I might flunk again.

308
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:37,333
Don't you worry?

309
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,583
Being a graduate is
nothing these days.

310
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:40,958
What will you do if
you don't graduate?

311
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:43,208
I'll be the best househusband.

312
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:45,333
I'll work at home.
Manage the kitchen.

313
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,916
How will you look after the kids?

314
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:48,791
I'll just get married.

315
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:50,041
I won't have kids right away.

316
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:52,458
-We will have some fun together first.
-Let it be.

317
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:54,666
I am no interest in
your honeymoon.

318
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:57,500
Why? Are you jealous of my wife?

319
00:23:58,166 --> 00:23:59,750
Because she will have such
a romantic husband?

320
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:07,083
She's the lucky one.

321
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:12,000
Your girlfriend?

322
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,875
My brother's sister-in-law.

323
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,250
I've booked her for marriage.

324
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:19,208
Is she a seat in the bus
which you can book?

325
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,583
Give it back. Don't cast an evil
eye on her. Give it back.

326
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:24,708
You should keep smiling.
I don't like it when you cry.

327
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,625
Are you trying to impress me?

328
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:29,041
Do girls get impressed like that?

329
00:24:29,916 --> 00:24:31,125
I don't know about such things.

330
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:32,583
I am naive person.

331
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:34,125
Let it be.

332
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:35,375
Give it here.

333
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:38,583
It won't come off.

334
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,750
Give it.

335
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:43,000
Okay, bye.

336
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:45,250
Don't you have to go to college?

337
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:47,666
If I wanted to study,
I would have done so in Malout.

338
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:49,375
There you go.

339
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:55,166
I told about my wedding plans
and yet she is talking to me.

340
00:24:55,291 --> 00:24:57,458
She will give in.

341
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:01,250
Yes?

342
00:25:05,625 --> 00:25:06,666
This is art?

343
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:09,750
No, this is art.
You want to see it?

344
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:13,458
No, I too am a very good artist.

345
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:15,708
Leave. Leave now.

346
00:25:34,708 --> 00:25:36,875
For how many more days won't
you talk to me properly?

347
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,625
Parents these days I tell you!

348
00:25:40,708 --> 00:25:43,208
Kids say something and
they start sulking.

349
00:25:44,583 --> 00:25:46,083
I know I made a mistake.

350
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:47,791
Do you want to kill
this little girl?

351
00:25:59,666 --> 00:26:01,875
Did your pride hurt so badly,
Gurnam Singh?

352
00:26:06,916 --> 00:26:08,083
I had just one desire.

353
00:26:10,208 --> 00:26:11,666
I selected the wrong guy.

354
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:15,083
I don't want to get into
this mess anymore.

355
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:20,875
I will marry anyone
you ask me to.

356
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:22,666
There is just one condition.

357
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:27,208
He should be just
like our Gurnam.

358
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:32,750
Don't get angry.

359
00:26:38,791 --> 00:26:39,833
No?

360
00:26:43,833 --> 00:26:44,958
Is it tasty?

361
00:26:54,791 --> 00:26:56,625
You come here.

362
00:26:58,375 --> 00:27:00,083
You are with me.

363
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:05,250
You too.

364
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:07,625
Look at that.

365
00:27:09,291 --> 00:27:11,666
Brother, you can't hit there.

366
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:13,416
Don't worry.

367
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,625
Whenever the ball goes there,
ask sister Bani to give it back.

368
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:17,458
She must be your sister.

369
00:27:19,416 --> 00:27:22,041
-Should I go and tell auntie?
-Brother, he is crazy.

370
00:27:22,125 --> 00:27:23,458
Bani is our sister.

371
00:27:24,916 --> 00:27:26,333
He's the smart one in my team.

372
00:27:26,958 --> 00:27:29,291
I like the younger one.

373
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:31,125
Hansh, your girl is here.

374
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,791
Are you out of your mind, imps?
Don't you have any sense?

375
00:27:43,125 --> 00:27:44,208
I don't want to play with you.

376
00:27:45,208 --> 00:27:46,208
Take this.

377
00:27:51,208 --> 00:27:52,333
Wonderful.

378
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,666
There is great demand.

379
00:27:54,083 --> 00:27:55,083
Lord have mercy.

380
00:27:55,166 --> 00:27:57,083
-What is?
-You are.

381
00:27:57,958 --> 00:28:00,125
-Whatever.
-Right, whatever.

382
00:28:00,458 --> 00:28:01,958
As if you don't know.

383
00:28:02,041 --> 00:28:04,500
Girls always know how many
people are after them.

384
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:06,916
But we cannot let go of this
decent character, right?

385
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,041
I have seen seven to eight of your
devotees since morning.

386
00:28:09,375 --> 00:28:11,750
One's over there. Look at him
using up all his strength.

387
00:28:11,833 --> 00:28:14,333
If he had used his strength
in farming...

388
00:28:14,416 --> 00:28:16,333
then he would be able to
harvest wheat in a day.

389
00:28:16,416 --> 00:28:18,666
And these kids that play cricket?
There is no future for them.

390
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,083
They are all after you,
let me tell you.

391
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:21,250
You shouldn't give the ball back.

392
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:22,958
They are nothing but
killing time.

393
00:28:23,541 --> 00:28:25,250
They look at all girls
in the same way.

394
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:27,958
Today I am here so
they are after me.

395
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:30,333
Tomorrow if they see someone
better, they will go after her.

396
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:34,375
By the way, one can have only
one boyfriend, right?

397
00:28:35,458 --> 00:28:36,500
And you are here.

398
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,416
What kind of a boy do you want?

399
00:28:42,458 --> 00:28:44,416
The one who vows to be yours
for seven lifetimes?

400
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,375
The one who goes to
temples with you?

401
00:28:49,708 --> 00:28:51,666
-Drinking from the same straw?
-No.

402
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:54,333
The one who feeds you?
There are so many cons in it.

403
00:28:54,416 --> 00:28:56,833
And when he talks about his benefit...
you say "enjoy it after marriage."

404
00:29:02,583 --> 00:29:05,250
Why did he drop the bat?

405
00:29:05,375 --> 00:29:08,833
No, I don't have demands now.

406
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:13,791
But I had thought about
that kind of a boy.

407
00:29:15,125 --> 00:29:16,750
Are these kinds of
boy even for real?

408
00:29:18,166 --> 00:29:19,791
<span style="style.default_1">This is like throwing</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the food out...</span>

409
00:29:19,875 --> 00:29:21,250
<span style="style.default_1">after cooking it for hours.</span>

410
00:29:21,541 --> 00:29:22,541
Tell me.

411
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:24,375
<span style="style.default_1">I don't think it will work out.</span>

412
00:29:24,458 --> 00:29:26,000
<span style="style.default_1">She is singing a</span>
<span style="style.default_1">different tune now.</span>

413
00:29:26,458 --> 00:29:28,541
-<span style="style.default_1">I should find another one.</span>
-Tell me.

414
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:31,375
Let me go.
I have to go and study.

415
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:36,125
-Bunty, did you do your homework.
-Yes, sister.

416
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:37,416
-Promise?
-Yes.

417
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,375
-All of it?
-Do you also stay here?

418
00:29:39,458 --> 00:29:40,708
No, in a hostel.

419
00:29:40,958 --> 00:29:42,791
-Which hostel?
-Punjab University.

420
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:44,166
-Okay.
-Gagan, come here.

421
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,375
Coming, sister.

422
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,958
<span style="style.default_1">Even the witch spares</span>
<span style="style.default_1">the neighborhood.</span>

423
00:30:07,291 --> 00:30:08,750
You are from Himachal?

424
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:10,291
Yes, how do you know?

425
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:12,791
You look like an apple.
It is hard not to notice.

426
00:30:12,958 --> 00:30:14,541
We have pumpkins.

427
00:30:14,666 --> 00:30:16,500
We have healthy girls.

428
00:30:16,583 --> 00:30:18,333
You represent your place.

429
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:23,458
By the way, Punjab is in good
terms with Himachal.

430
00:30:23,541 --> 00:30:25,458
We have a love-hate relationship
with Haryana...

431
00:30:25,541 --> 00:30:27,041
and Rajasthan because of water.

432
00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:28,416
Yes.

433
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,250
-Yes.
-I have a peacock.

434
00:30:37,291 --> 00:30:39,333
It flew away. Hold on.

435
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:41,458
It is still there.

436
00:30:42,291 --> 00:30:43,291
Hey!

437
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:46,208
What are you doing?

438
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:47,875
Excuse me.

439
00:30:50,375 --> 00:30:52,208
Wait here. Don't go away.
I will be right back.

440
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:54,041
I'll be right back.

441
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,000
-Wonderful.
-What were you doing?

442
00:31:04,083 --> 00:31:06,208
Nothing. She just had a breakup.

443
00:31:06,541 --> 00:31:09,000
-She was telling me her story.
-Okay.

444
00:31:09,083 --> 00:31:10,875
-Should I tell sister-in-law, Anmol?
-Why?

445
00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:13,083
-Have you come here to do all this?
-Yes.

446
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:15,250
I won't let you.
You are a nice boy.

447
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:17,208
No, I am not a nice boy.
As if you know better.

448
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,583
So, what is the difference
between you and my ex-boyfriend?

449
00:31:19,708 --> 00:31:21,958
There is a lot of difference.
He was two-faced.

450
00:31:22,041 --> 00:31:23,083
I don't even have one.

451
00:31:23,166 --> 00:31:24,833
You have already chosen the
one you want to marry.

452
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:26,375
We aren't married yet.

453
00:31:26,458 --> 00:31:28,333
You are so desperate.

454
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:30,333
What?

455
00:31:30,541 --> 00:31:32,583
-Letch.
-No, I am not.

456
00:31:32,666 --> 00:31:33,958
Not everyone in this
world is like you.

457
00:31:34,041 --> 00:31:35,041
There are some like me as well.

458
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:37,333
Love makes people
lose their honor.

459
00:31:37,416 --> 00:31:39,083
And they also make their
family suffer.

460
00:31:39,166 --> 00:31:41,041
No harm is done to anyone
when you go casual.

461
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:42,583
Why do you want to go casual?

462
00:31:42,708 --> 00:31:44,250
Can't you control your desires?

463
00:31:47,125 --> 00:31:48,125
Lord help me.

464
00:31:48,208 --> 00:31:50,041
-Upma.
-Hi, sis.

465
00:31:50,125 --> 00:31:51,625
We are going on.

466
00:31:51,708 --> 00:31:54,333
We had a fight that's why
he was acting funny.

467
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,875
He is very cute.

468
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:57,541
-I'll punch you.
-No.

469
00:31:57,625 --> 00:31:58,625
Shut up.

470
00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:00,541
He is just kidding.

471
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:02,666
Listen to me! What...

472
00:32:07,041 --> 00:32:08,708
She is just kidding.
No.

473
00:32:08,791 --> 00:32:10,458
She is just bluffing, honestly.

474
00:32:10,541 --> 00:32:12,833
You stupid Punjabi...
you are smart enough.

475
00:32:12,916 --> 00:32:14,666
My apple!

476
00:32:15,375 --> 00:32:16,500
Hey!

477
00:32:28,916 --> 00:32:30,541
Who invited him here?

478
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,750
Jas called him.

479
00:32:32,916 --> 00:32:35,500
She didn't know about you two.

480
00:32:47,041 --> 00:32:49,791
<span style="style.default_1">-Will you join me at the club?</span>
-Club? What will I do there?

481
00:32:53,083 --> 00:32:54,666
-Yes?
-What happens at a club, bro?

482
00:32:54,916 --> 00:32:57,958
They drink and dance.

483
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:05,000
Okay,
I'll be there as you insist.

484
00:33:08,833 --> 00:33:11,000
I'll get lucky if she is drunk.

485
00:33:11,083 --> 00:33:12,750
You snooze, you lose.

486
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:27,291
<span style="style.default_1">He troubles me in my dreams</span>
<span style="style.default_1">She says to her friends</span>

487
00:33:27,458 --> 00:33:29,333
<span style="style.default_1">To her friends</span>

488
00:33:29,666 --> 00:33:32,416
<span style="style.default_1">Dance with me if you want to</span>

489
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,875
<span style="style.default_1">What good will making faces do to you?</span>

490
00:33:35,041 --> 00:33:40,208
<span style="style.default_1">If you don't like me drinking</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Then I don't like you</span>

491

<span style="style.default_1">If you don't like me drinking</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Then I don't like you</span>

492

<span style="style.default_1">I'll return it if I have to,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">The silver ring, dear</span>

493
00:33:51,041 --> 00:33:56,250
<span style="style.default_1">Leave me if you want to,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I won't die alone, dear</span>

494
00:33:56,333 --> 00:34:02,000
<span style="style.default_1">He troubles me in my dreams</span>
<span style="style.default_1">She says to her friends</span>

495

499
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:42,083
<span style="style.default_1">All my friends are just</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Like God to me</span>

500
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:44,541
<span style="style.default_1">The ones you cuss so freely</span>

501
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:49,666
<span style="style.default_1">I can let go of alcohol, but alcohol</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Does not let go of me</span>

502

<span style="style.default_1">All my friends are just</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Like God to me</span>

<span style="style.default_1">I can let go of alcohol, but alcohol</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Does not let go of me</span>

505
00:35:00,375 --> 00:35:03,416
<span style="style.default_1">The one I brew at home</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Rocks the world</span>

506
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,000
<span style="style.default_1">What good will a pub do to me?</span>

507
00:35:06,083 --> 00:35:08,166
<span style="style.default_1">What good will a pub do to me?</span>

508
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:10,833
<span style="style.default_1">If you don't</span>

509
00:35:10,916 --> 00:35:16,166
<span style="style.default_1">If you don't like me drinking</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Then I don't like you</span>

510
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:22,041
<span style="style.default_1">If you don't like me drinking</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Then I don't like you</span>

511
00:35:22,125 --> 00:35:26,416
<span style="style.default_1">Oh my love</span>

512
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,166
<span style="style.default_1">Whose shoulder will you cry on?</span>

513
00:35:29,291 --> 00:35:31,041
<span style="style.default_1">Whose shoulder will you cry on?</span>

514
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:34,875
<span style="style.default_1">If I go and drink with your father?</span>

515
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:40,291
<span style="style.default_1">Go and sit on a side,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Don't ruin my mood</span>

516
00:35:40,375 --> 00:35:45,666
<span style="style.default_1">When I empty a John Walker,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">You can take me home too</span>

517
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:51,000
<span style="style.default_1">Go and sit on a side,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Don't ruin my mood</span>

518
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:56,375
<span style="style.default_1">When I empty a John Walker,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">You came take me home too</span>

519
00:35:56,458 --> 00:36:04,208
<span style="style.default_1">I can hold my liquor,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I don't talk much too</span>

520
00:36:04,291 --> 00:36:06,875
<span style="style.default_1">If you don't...</span>

521
00:36:06,958 --> 00:36:12,208
<span style="style.default_1">If you don't like me drinking</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Then I don't like you</span>

522
00:36:12,291 --> 00:36:18,083
<span style="style.default_1">If you don't like me drinking</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Then I don't like you</span>

523
00:36:32,541 --> 00:36:34,625
-I had fun.
-You too?

524
00:36:35,458 --> 00:36:37,208
I thought only boys had fun.

525
00:36:37,666 --> 00:36:39,166
Where is your decency now?

526
00:36:39,416 --> 00:36:41,000
I am decent not blind.

527
00:36:42,125 --> 00:36:43,250
Do your parents know?

528
00:36:43,416 --> 00:36:45,208
Papa is on night duty
and my mother knows.

529
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:49,333
-Should we call for more?
-No, we are enough. We will handle him.

530
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:58,916
Finally, showing your true
colors, you hooligan?

531
00:37:01,208 --> 00:37:03,375
Come on hero, hit them.

532
00:37:05,541 --> 00:37:06,916
What do you mean by hit them?

533
00:37:07,041 --> 00:37:08,375
Get lost.

534
00:37:08,666 --> 00:37:10,125
What do I have
to do with this?

535
00:37:10,208 --> 00:37:11,625
This is between the two of you.

536
00:37:11,708 --> 00:37:12,875
Resolve it on your own.

537
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:16,333
You really look like Gary Sandhu.

538
00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:27,583
Forget me, not even my sandal
isn't scared of anyone.

539
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:32,250
When I have a Jat with
me to keep me company.

540
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:33,625
No, no, no.

541
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,208
I am in a bad state.

542
00:37:35,291 --> 00:37:37,166
I anyway don't get along with
Haryana and Rajasthan.

543
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,166
And you didn't let me get
cozy with Himachal.

544
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,666
You know I feel alone.

545
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,291
You should resolve
this on your own.

546
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,333
What do you think of yourself?

547
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:51,708
-I told you two talk.
-I didn't ask you to touch her.

548
00:37:51,791 --> 00:37:53,166
You...

549
00:37:57,416 --> 00:37:58,875
Damn you.

550
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:04,708
You fed them some snacks
and brought them alone.

551
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,666
You think you are
a great villain?

552
00:38:06,916 --> 00:38:08,166
Come on, say sorry.

553
00:38:09,458 --> 00:38:11,333
Say it property or should
do I need to teach you a lesson?

554
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:15,875
-Sorry, sister.
-One, just one. Please, dear.

555
00:38:18,458 --> 00:38:20,458
You dog!
Will you ever cheat anyone else?

556
00:38:20,541 --> 00:38:23,750
I troubled my parents. Will you
ever cheat again?

557
00:38:23,833 --> 00:38:25,166
-Will you ever cheat again?
-That's enough.

558
00:38:25,291 --> 00:38:27,125
-That's enough.
-I fought with my parents because of you.

559
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:28,166
-Enough.
-And what did you do?

560
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:31,291
-My father didn't talk to me for a month!
-That's enough.

561
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,666
Sorry.

562
00:38:43,666 --> 00:38:44,875
What is your name?

563
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:47,083
Shivjit Singh Gill.

564
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:48,583
Shiva is enough.

565
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,625
I don't want to print it
on a wedding invite.

566
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,458
You made him address
me as sister.

567
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:56,208
I was his girlfriend.

568
00:38:56,291 --> 00:38:58,083
Right, you were his girlfriend.

569
00:38:58,666 --> 00:39:00,708
You didn't even let
him touch you.

570
00:39:02,083 --> 00:39:03,750
You don't have any shame, do you?

571
00:39:05,583 --> 00:39:07,250
But I felt good.

572
00:39:07,333 --> 00:39:09,208
My soul is at peace.

573
00:39:20,541 --> 00:39:22,958
<span style="style.default_1">You are not as scoundrel</span>
<span style="style.default_1">as you pretend to be.</span>

574
00:39:23,958 --> 00:39:25,083
<span style="style.default_1">I am.</span>

575
00:39:26,166 --> 00:39:29,166
<span style="style.default_1">You aren't. 'You won't</span>
<span style="style.default_1">be able to do casual.</span>

576
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:31,333
<span style="style.default_1">I will.</span>

577
00:39:31,583 --> 00:39:32,583
<span style="style.default_1">I will.</span>

578
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:39,708
You boys think that you
are of the same category.

579
00:39:39,958 --> 00:39:42,250
To look at all girls
in the same way.

580
00:39:42,416 --> 00:39:44,750
To try your luck at every
girl who looks good.

581
00:39:46,458 --> 00:39:48,666
And not to stick to the
one who says yes.

582
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,791
Five or seven,
no matter how many there are...

583
00:39:51,875 --> 00:39:53,250
you are never satisfied.

584
00:39:57,666 --> 00:40:00,125
But actually,
you too have two categories.

585
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:02,208
The one who ran away.

586
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:05,083
And the second is you.

587
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:12,666
Just one touch and we girls
know what the boy thinks.

588
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:18,708
That day you put your hand around
my waist and hugged me.

589
00:40:20,541 --> 00:40:21,875
There was no problem in it.

590
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:26,291
You won't be able to be casual.

591
00:40:28,375 --> 00:40:30,166
If it happens, it will be love.

592
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:32,625
Think about it.

593
00:40:33,083 --> 00:40:34,250
Your brother's sister-in-law...

594
00:40:34,333 --> 00:40:35,541
might end up waiting for you forever.

595
00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:37,083
Let's go.

596
00:40:54,291 --> 00:40:55,583
<span style="style.default_1">What is wrong with you two?</span>

597
00:40:55,666 --> 00:40:57,375
<span style="style.default_1">We were waiting for such a chance.</span>

598
00:40:57,916 --> 00:41:00,083
<span style="style.default_1">We are decent and we don't</span>
<span style="style.default_1">even know about it</span>

599
00:41:03,791 --> 00:41:06,041
<span style="style.default_1">You've beaten up a boy</span>
<span style="style.default_1">you don't know...</span>

600
00:41:06,125 --> 00:41:08,166
<span style="style.default_1">just because she</span>
<span style="style.default_1">asked you to.</span>

601
00:41:08,375 --> 00:41:11,166
<span style="style.default_1">Even when you know you have</span>
<span style="style.default_1">no scope with her.</span>

602
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:18,083
<span style="style.default_1">And you don't want her</span>
<span style="style.default_1">in short clothes.</span>

603
00:41:20,958 --> 00:41:24,333
<span style="style.default_1">And you cannot tolerate</span>
<span style="style.default_1">anyone looking at her.</span>

604
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:27,833
<span style="style.default_1">Since when did I start getting</span>
<span style="style.default_1">so many feelings?</span>

605
00:41:30,375 --> 00:41:32,166
<span style="style.default_1">Are you in love with her, Shiva?</span>

606
00:41:43,666 --> 00:41:46,583
Tell me something aunt,
have you ever been in love?

607
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:51,666
No, I didn't get the time.

608
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:56,000
Your uncle was always racing
to and fro to the fields.

609
00:41:56,375 --> 00:41:58,291
No, uncle came after
you two got married.

610
00:41:58,375 --> 00:41:59,416
I am talking about the time
before you got married.

611
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,833
Before I got married...

612
00:42:02,083 --> 00:42:04,500
Shiva, who is she?

613
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:09,000
No aunt, it is not so.

614
00:42:09,083 --> 00:42:10,333
I was just asking.

615
00:42:10,416 --> 00:42:12,583
I am going to marry Gurinder's
sister-in-law.

616
00:42:12,666 --> 00:42:16,541
Look, Shiva. Don't do anything
untoward with anyone's daughter.

617
00:42:16,666 --> 00:42:19,583
No, aunt. She doesn't even
let me touch her.

618
00:42:19,833 --> 00:42:21,750
You are a troublemaker.

619
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:23,958
What kind of a conversation are
you having with an old woman?

620
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:26,958
As if I am your best friend.

621
00:42:34,166 --> 00:42:35,166
Brother?

622
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:37,083
Your aunt is very modern,
I guess.

623
00:42:37,166 --> 00:42:38,125
Do I need to explain?

624
00:42:38,208 --> 00:42:40,458
I mean she thinks well.

625
00:42:40,666 --> 00:42:41,791
Here you go.

626
00:42:43,125 --> 00:42:48,791
<span style="style.default_1">I love you a lot, my love</span>

627
00:42:49,583 --> 00:42:51,208
Hey, do you know what love is?

628
00:42:51,291 --> 00:42:52,666
-Of course, I do.
-Damn you.

629
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:55,541
This is how it feel,
like you touch a hot iron.

630
00:42:55,875 --> 00:43:00,833
<span style="style.default_1">I love you a lot, my love</span>

631
00:43:00,916 --> 00:43:02,708
Love?
Of course, I know what it is.

632
00:43:02,791 --> 00:43:04,458
She wanted cold drink,
I brought her cold drink.

633
00:43:04,541 --> 00:43:06,541
She wanted snacks,
I bought snacks for her.

634
00:43:06,666 --> 00:43:09,000
All the first day first
shows at the cinema.

635
00:43:09,083 --> 00:43:11,916
She wanted a ring and
I stole my mother's ring...

636
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,125
and put it on her finger.

637
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:17,333
I can't tell you how many
dresses I gifted her.

638
00:43:17,416 --> 00:43:20,000
Then she got a marriage proposal
and I got my result.

639
00:43:20,083 --> 00:43:23,125
Her father got her married
in two months.

640
00:43:23,208 --> 00:43:25,500
My father opened me this stall.

641
00:43:25,583 --> 00:43:30,791
Potatoes, patties, yogurt snacks.
This is the damned love.

642
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:38,708
Brother, when in love, you do
each other's homework as well.

643
00:43:44,875 --> 00:43:46,916
Should we tell him
that you kiss each other...

644
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,125
as well when in love?

645
00:43:49,458 --> 00:43:52,875
For a married man it is a
sin even to mention it.

646
00:43:53,583 --> 00:43:57,166
If Anmol learns about it,
she will run away.

647
00:43:57,583 --> 00:44:00,250
I am getting food on the table.
I have a child.

648
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:03,000
Whether there is love or not...

649
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:05,666
it no longer matters now.

650
00:44:08,458 --> 00:44:11,041
Tell me something, Bani.
When do you know you are in love?

651
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Who?

652
00:44:15,416 --> 00:44:16,583
Seerat?

653
00:44:17,041 --> 00:44:20,000
-You kept looking at her all night long?
-No.

654
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,750
Dimple!
Oh no! It is Dimple, tell me!

655
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,208
Don't remind me of the party.

656
00:44:30,291 --> 00:44:31,416
No one in my family has
ever been in love.

657
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,666
That's why I am asking you.

658
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,416
Once my grandpa's father
had been in love.

659
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:35,750
He had eloped with someone's
daughter.

660
00:44:35,833 --> 00:44:37,125
He was shot dead by her family.

661
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:38,666
So, we weren't left with anyone
to tell us about it.

662
00:44:39,083 --> 00:44:40,125
That's why I was asking you.

663
00:44:40,541 --> 00:44:41,750
Tell me.

664
00:44:45,458 --> 00:44:46,666
It rains.

665
00:44:49,916 --> 00:44:54,708
I feel that when you are really
in love, it rains.

666
00:44:56,833 --> 00:44:58,458
God gives you a hint.

667
00:45:00,916 --> 00:45:03,625
There are no clouds in the sky, thank
God. It is not love.

668
00:45:04,833 --> 00:45:06,541
You don't feel hungry.

669
00:45:07,208 --> 00:45:08,958
You don't sleep well either.

670
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:11,958
Something new happens.

671
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:15,958
Nothing like this had
happened to me.

672
00:45:16,708 --> 00:45:18,250
Not with that idiot.

673
00:45:18,833 --> 00:45:21,250
He had said that he felt like
this and so I said yes.

674
00:45:22,583 --> 00:45:23,958
And look what happened...

675
00:45:26,333 --> 00:45:28,375
I used to think completely
opposite than you think.

676
00:45:29,041 --> 00:45:31,000
You wanted to marry the girl
of your family's liking.

677
00:45:31,458 --> 00:45:33,583
And I used to say that I'll
find my own match.

678
00:45:33,875 --> 00:45:36,583
I have never spent time with
my relatives either.

679
00:45:36,666 --> 00:45:38,666
So, it's very difficult for me

680
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:41,791
to spend my life with someone
I don't even know.

681
00:45:42,083 --> 00:45:43,708
They show you the photograph
of the boy, right?

682
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:45,541
Great.

683
00:45:45,833 --> 00:45:48,125
So, I know the boy just because
I have seen his photograph?

684
00:45:48,208 --> 00:45:50,250
Showing the photograph
is just a formality.

685
00:45:50,958 --> 00:45:52,625
If you refuse, you get a reply...

686
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:54,666
<span style="style.default_1">All the boys are the same</span>

687
00:45:56,333 --> 00:45:58,208
You get to see the girl
at someone's wedding

688
00:45:58,291 --> 00:45:59,666
under some pretext.

689
00:46:00,083 --> 00:46:03,458
Have you heard of a family taking
a girl to show her the boy?

690
00:46:05,583 --> 00:46:08,583
Poor thing,
my father had agreed...

691
00:46:08,666 --> 00:46:10,583
but that cheap scoundrel
ruined everything.

692
00:46:13,291 --> 00:46:17,791
I told my father to find
a match for me.

693
00:46:21,333 --> 00:46:23,208
Aunt had sent photographs.

694
00:46:25,083 --> 00:46:27,000
The exhibition has begun.

695
00:46:28,458 --> 00:46:30,166
And then there will be dowry.

696
00:46:36,583 --> 00:46:37,583
Will you take it?

697
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:39,625
Yes. It is a part of our culture.

698
00:46:39,708 --> 00:46:42,208
My uncle's son took 4.5
million at his wedding.

699
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,250
And since I study in Chandigarh,
I'll demand more.

700
00:46:44,333 --> 00:46:46,041
I'll also demand a car, Fortuner.

701
00:46:49,291 --> 00:46:51,250
Don't worry.
You won't have to give it.

702
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,708
You are just two sisters.

703
00:46:52,791 --> 00:46:53,833
They will be satisfied
with your property.

704
00:46:53,916 --> 00:46:54,916
You can divide it equally
among yourselves.

705
00:46:55,208 --> 00:46:56,916
The money on the food
at the wedding will...

706
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,208
also be paid by
the groom's side.

707
00:46:59,041 --> 00:47:00,041
Don't worry.

708
00:47:00,583 --> 00:47:02,875
May God bless this sinner
with seven daughters!

709
00:47:05,125 --> 00:47:06,208
No!

710
00:47:07,833 --> 00:47:10,208
Don't get cheated.
You better seek my advice.

711
00:47:22,583 --> 00:47:23,791
No, no, no.

712
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:25,791
She is wrong.

713
00:47:26,916 --> 00:47:28,958
Why does she need to go for
an arranged marriage?

714
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:34,000
She doesn't deserve an
arranged marriage.

715
00:47:34,083 --> 00:47:36,250
And she won't be able to go
through with it either.

716
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,166
Who are you?

717
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:39,375
I am your conscience.

718
00:47:40,041 --> 00:47:41,333
Talk to her.

719
00:47:41,583 --> 00:47:42,916
Why should I?

720
00:47:44,291 --> 00:47:45,333
She is your friend.

721
00:47:45,416 --> 00:47:47,083
Who will talk to her if not you?

722
00:47:47,416 --> 00:47:48,666
And you didn't like it when...

723
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:50,250
she agreed for an arranged marriage.

724
00:47:52,166 --> 00:47:53,458
That is true.

725
00:47:54,583 --> 00:47:56,250
But she is quite intelligent.

726
00:47:56,333 --> 00:47:57,833
How can I talk to her?

727
00:47:59,416 --> 00:48:01,500
Why don't you write
her a letter then?

728
00:48:02,916 --> 00:48:03,916
Will you help me?

729
00:48:15,625 --> 00:48:16,916
Bani, is uncle at home?

730
00:48:18,416 --> 00:48:19,625
Papa!

731
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:27,291
Uncle,
the boy who stays upstairs...

732
00:48:27,375 --> 00:48:30,041
he asked me to give
this letter to Bani.

733
00:48:36,916 --> 00:48:41,250
<span style="style.default_1">I didn't know that this little</span>
<span style="style.default_1">pest also eyed Bani.</span>

734
00:48:46,041 --> 00:48:47,083
Shiva!

735
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:49,291
What had you written in it?

736
00:48:49,875 --> 00:48:50,916
You didn't read it?

737
00:48:51,208 --> 00:48:52,916
Bunty gave the letter
to my father.

738
00:48:53,125 --> 00:48:54,125
Oh damn!

739
00:48:54,666 --> 00:48:57,083
-Your father will beat me up?
-No, he will worship you.

740
00:48:57,625 --> 00:48:59,708
I told you,
there is nothing between us.

741
00:48:59,791 --> 00:49:00,958
But you don't get it, do you?

742
00:49:01,041 --> 00:49:02,375
I am sure you must have
drawn hearts in them.

743
00:49:02,458 --> 00:49:03,875
No, I didn't propose you.

744
00:49:03,958 --> 00:49:06,166
Then what? Did you write a letter
so that I can pardon your fees?

745
00:49:07,208 --> 00:49:08,416
I just don't get it.

746
00:49:08,541 --> 00:49:10,458
Couldn't you just call
me and tell me?

747
00:49:10,625 --> 00:49:12,125
Why did you have to
write it down?

748
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:14,458
Counselor told me.

749
00:49:16,958 --> 00:49:18,166
He has lost his mind.

750
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:20,041
Bani, please leave. Your father
will be here any moment.

751
00:49:20,125 --> 00:49:21,958
-He has gone to the police station.
-To file a report against me?

752
00:49:22,208 --> 00:49:24,041
-On his duty
-Duty? What?

753
00:49:24,125 --> 00:49:25,375
Papa is a police officer.

754
00:49:26,875 --> 00:49:28,458
Bani,
I hope your father doesn't file...

755
00:49:28,541 --> 00:49:31,208
-a false case of drugs against me.
-Bani!

756
00:49:31,333 --> 00:49:34,708
What! You are so mean!

757
00:49:34,958 --> 00:49:36,250
Coming, mummy!

758
00:49:36,333 --> 00:49:39,000
Now if in a hurry papa gets me
married to any stupid, idiot...

759
00:49:39,083 --> 00:49:40,041
then I won't spare you.

760
00:49:41,208 --> 00:49:43,083
I won't even leave you capable
enough to ever write again.

761
00:49:43,583 --> 00:49:44,708
Should I run back to my village?

762
00:49:44,791 --> 00:49:48,750
No. Oh no,
I wonder where that counselor is!

763
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,625
POLICE STATION - PHASE 8 - MOHALI.

764
00:49:53,833 --> 00:49:55,375
Be brave, Shiva.

765
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:57,625
No one can see what doesn't
happen in front of them.

766
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:02,208
He will beat me up in
front of everyone.

767
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:05,541
Sister-in-law's parental family
will also learn about it.

768
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
God help me,
I have worn two pants today.

769
00:50:08,875 --> 00:50:10,208
Be with me, Lord.

770
00:50:13,958 --> 00:50:15,125
Where are you off to?

771
00:50:16,375 --> 00:50:18,791
-I had to need the SHO.
-You are walking straight in?

772
00:50:19,041 --> 00:50:20,250
What are you, his son-in-law?

773
00:50:23,041 --> 00:50:24,625
No, that's not true.

774
00:50:25,125 --> 00:50:26,375
We are just friends.

775
00:50:28,708 --> 00:50:29,541
Brother...

776
00:50:29,833 --> 00:50:32,000
Don't worry, man.
You'll learn a lesson today.

777
00:50:32,083 --> 00:50:34,416
-What will you do, brother?
-Don't worry. We'll tell you.

778
00:50:38,291 --> 00:50:40,000
He said he is your
daughter's friend.

779
00:50:40,083 --> 00:50:41,791
Should I strap him in?

780
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:44,541
No, uncle. Please listen to me.

781
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:46,083
I am not that kind of a boy.

782
00:50:47,875 --> 00:50:50,125
Uncle,
I agree that I wrote that letter.

783
00:50:50,208 --> 00:50:52,000
But I have not written
anything wrong in it.

784
00:50:52,083 --> 00:50:53,875
Well, just as a friend.

785
00:50:54,125 --> 00:50:55,750
I have also written
that there is...

786
00:50:55,833 --> 00:50:57,291
nothing greater than parents.

787
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:01,166
You should change your house
before I go back home.

788
00:51:02,291 --> 00:51:03,375
Okay, uncle.

789
00:51:04,291 --> 00:51:05,291
Go.

790
00:51:05,875 --> 00:51:06,875
Can I leave?

791
00:51:08,958 --> 00:51:11,000
-One more thing.
-Yes?

792
00:51:11,083 --> 00:51:12,333
Yes, we won't meet again.

793
00:51:16,125 --> 00:51:17,458
He was her father?

794
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:19,750
Forget beating me up,
he didn't even cuss me.

795
00:51:19,833 --> 00:51:20,916
If it had been my village...

796
00:51:21,083 --> 00:51:22,875
the girl's father would've
broken my legs.

797
00:51:22,958 --> 00:51:25,250
Then all the villagers would have
beaten me black and blue.

798
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,625
This is the difference
of education.

799
00:51:50,375 --> 00:51:52,083
I'm going to get a rickshaw.

800
00:52:02,333 --> 00:52:03,833
Serve dinner, let's eat.

801
00:52:04,583 --> 00:52:06,583
Mummy didn't make any dinner.

802
00:52:06,875 --> 00:52:09,291
What? What's wrong?

803
00:52:09,375 --> 00:52:10,625
Well,
I just thought no one would...

804
00:52:10,916 --> 00:52:12,375
be interested in dinner anyway.

805
00:52:13,166 --> 00:52:14,166
Why so?

806
00:52:15,458 --> 00:52:18,625
What is my daughter's
fault if some...

807
00:52:18,708 --> 00:52:20,541
stupid kid handed
over a letter?

808
00:52:24,208 --> 00:52:25,541
Let's do one thing then.

809
00:52:26,208 --> 00:52:27,375
Let's order pizza.

810
00:52:28,083 --> 00:52:29,083
Okay?

811
00:52:29,375 --> 00:52:30,416
I'll be right back.

812
00:52:38,041 --> 00:52:40,291
You too got influenced by the
bad winds of Chandigarh?

813
00:52:40,375 --> 00:52:41,833
Now you will have to hunt for
another place to stay?

814
00:52:41,916 --> 00:52:43,833
I am sure you must have made
a girlfriend by now.

815
00:52:44,083 --> 00:52:46,125
Go ahead and waste your
parents' money.

816
00:52:46,291 --> 00:52:49,541
I'll tell Titu how you
have hurt Bunty.

817
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:50,833
You just wait and watch.

818
00:53:28,666 --> 00:53:29,875
<span style="style.default_1">There was not a single cloud...</span>

819
00:53:29,958 --> 00:53:31,625
<span style="style.default_1">in the sky back then.</span>

820
00:53:33,833 --> 00:53:36,125
<span style="style.default_1">I used to eat a lot</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and sleep well too.</span>

821
00:53:37,041 --> 00:53:38,875
<span style="style.default_1">All that Bani had told me about love...</span>

822
00:53:42,125 --> 00:53:43,708
<span style="style.default_1">I did not experience anything.</span>

823
00:53:46,416 --> 00:53:48,166
<span style="style.default_1">But I didn't need to ask anyone.</span>

824
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
<span style="style.default_1">I knew that I am done for.</span>

825
00:53:52,125 --> 00:53:54,208
<span style="style.default_1">Because something very</span>
<span style="style.default_1">strange happened with me.</span>

826
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:59,166
<span style="style.default_1">Whatever I did, I used to</span>
<span style="style.default_1">feel I am on that rooftop.</span>

827
00:54:23,041 --> 00:54:24,458
<span style="style.default_1">When I stayed away from her...</span>

828
00:54:24,583 --> 00:54:25,916
<span style="style.default_1">I realized how close</span>
<span style="style.default_1">she was to me.</span>

829
00:54:35,416 --> 00:54:37,375
I think you have started
romancing.

830
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,583
Go ahead. Go on.

831
00:54:40,708 --> 00:54:42,333
I too have done it
back in the days.

832
00:54:42,416 --> 00:54:44,125
There's a reason why
I am on the streets.

833
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:46,083
Otherwise,
I would have become something.

834
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:47,458
Do I need to talk to you?

835
00:54:47,541 --> 00:54:50,208
Don't worry. You can open a
puncture stall close by.

836
00:54:52,791 --> 00:54:55,291
What are you doing here?
Do one thing, serve another plate of it.

837
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:56,625
Mix water.

838
00:54:58,458 --> 00:54:59,750
Why are you following me?

839
00:55:00,791 --> 00:55:03,166
-I can see everything.
-I know that you can see everything.

840
00:55:03,375 --> 00:55:04,583
Then why don't you say anything?

841
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:06,958
You didn't say anything either.

842
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:10,875
At least, listen to me.

843
00:55:20,208 --> 00:55:21,916
Bani, please listen to me.

844
00:55:40,916 --> 00:55:42,916
If you insist then, go ahead.

845
00:55:44,166 --> 00:55:46,250
I didn't insist.
I just asked you once.

846
00:55:46,958 --> 00:55:48,708
-Fine then.
-No, I insisted.

847
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,083
No, I insisted. I insisted.

848
00:55:52,625 --> 00:55:53,833
Tell me,
what had your written in it.

849
00:55:55,125 --> 00:55:56,333
Say it again?

850
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,958
You never stop talking otherwise.

851
00:55:59,833 --> 00:56:01,916
Bani, I swear, I hadn't written
I love you in it.

852
00:56:02,458 --> 00:56:04,458
Think about it,
why would I like you?

853
00:56:04,541 --> 00:56:05,750
What's so great about you?

854
00:56:06,833 --> 00:56:10,000
There is a lot. Now tell me
what had you written in it.

855
00:56:10,125 --> 00:56:11,416
Nothing, just...

856
00:56:12,708 --> 00:56:14,250
Tell me,
why are you getting it all wrong?

857
00:56:15,583 --> 00:56:17,000
You know nothing is greater
than your parents.

858
00:56:17,833 --> 00:56:19,958
It is not about love and
arranged marriage.

859
00:56:22,083 --> 00:56:24,125
Just because one person
is wrong doesn't...

860
00:56:24,541 --> 00:56:25,791
mean everybody will be wrong.

861
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:27,750
Right?

862
00:56:30,208 --> 00:56:31,750
What do I say about love?
You can fall in love again.

863
00:56:31,833 --> 00:56:33,208
Just give yourself a chance.

864
00:56:36,333 --> 00:56:40,875
We sow grams even when it's not
our turn to get the water.

865
00:56:40,958 --> 00:56:42,750
As we believe,
He will provide us with rain.

866
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,291
And you are a firm
believer in God.

867
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:48,375
Give Him a chance
to make it rain.

868
00:56:48,541 --> 00:56:49,791
Who did you ask to write it?

869
00:56:49,875 --> 00:56:51,541
I am sure you can't
write such things.

870
00:57:01,541 --> 00:57:03,166
I wrote it, on my own.

871
00:57:06,583 --> 00:57:08,958
Papa asked you to change your
house for such a small thing?

872
00:57:09,416 --> 00:57:10,875
Why didn't you tell me?

873
00:57:11,041 --> 00:57:12,541
You have written such
a nice thing.

874
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,416
You know I was going to ruin my
life because of that idiot.

875
00:57:17,083 --> 00:57:18,458
Have I written it that well?

876
00:57:19,916 --> 00:57:21,125
It was great.

877
00:57:22,541 --> 00:57:23,666
This is the first time
you said something...

878
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:24,791
sensible in the
past three months.

879
00:57:56,750 --> 00:57:57,750
Give it to me.

880
00:57:57,875 --> 00:58:00,125
-No, I won't.
-Give it here or else.

881
00:58:00,708 --> 00:58:02,708
Mr. Romeo wants to romance.

882
00:58:02,875 --> 00:58:05,041
I'll break your bones if
you play here again.

883
00:58:05,125 --> 00:58:07,375
I'll show you what's wrong,
Mr. Romeo.

884
00:58:07,458 --> 00:58:09,458
What if the ball hits the senior
citizens who sit here?

885
00:58:09,541 --> 00:58:12,291
-Who will be responsible for it?
-Your family won't help them.

886
00:58:12,375 --> 00:58:13,208
Come on, leave!

887
00:58:13,291 --> 00:58:15,833
I'll break your bones if I seek
you here again. Leave!

888
00:58:16,958 --> 00:58:18,375
Are you leaving or not?

889
00:58:20,666 --> 00:58:22,583
-I seek your blessing.
-God bless you, son.

890
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:24,625
Oh no!

891
00:58:27,166 --> 00:58:29,333
Drop me to college.

892
00:58:29,583 --> 00:58:31,250
I came here to iron my clothes.

893
00:58:32,541 --> 00:58:33,541
Hop on.

894
00:58:35,208 --> 00:58:42,500
<span style="style.default_1">Two hearts are coming together,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">But stealthily</span>

895
00:58:42,666 --> 00:58:44,083
<span style="style.default_1">Two hearts</span>

896
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:09,583
<span style="style.default_1">Your eyes are so full of light</span>

897
00:59:09,708 --> 00:59:15,416
<span style="style.default_1">Your words, peace filled delight</span>

898
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:20,166
<span style="style.default_1">Your eyes are so full of light</span>

899
00:59:20,375 --> 00:59:25,958
<span style="style.default_1">Your words, peace filled delight</span>

900
00:59:26,041 --> 00:59:32,333
<span style="style.default_1">I thought God called out to me</span>

901
00:59:32,416 --> 00:59:36,666
<span style="style.default_1">But it ended up being you</span>

902
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:43,041
<span style="style.default_1">I thought God called out to me</span>

903
00:59:43,125 --> 00:59:47,000
<span style="style.default_1">But it ended up being you</span>

904
00:59:47,416 --> 00:59:52,875
<span style="style.default_1">I love you more than</span>
<span style="style.default_1">You can imagine</span>

905
00:59:52,958 --> 00:59:57,625
<span style="style.default_1">I love you more than</span>
<span style="style.default_1">You can imagine</span>

906
00:59:57,750 --> 01:00:00,333
<span style="style.default_1">You are different</span>

907
01:00:00,416 --> 01:00:03,375
<span style="style.default_1">I am nothing compared to you</span>

908
01:00:03,458 --> 01:00:08,875
<span style="style.default_1">Stay close to me, I beg you</span>

909
01:00:08,958 --> 01:00:13,541
<span style="style.default_1">Stay close to me, I beg you</span>

910
01:00:13,625 --> 01:00:16,291
<span style="style.default_1">You are different</span>

911
01:00:16,416 --> 01:00:19,250
<span style="style.default_1">I am nothing compared to you</span>

912
01:00:19,375 --> 01:00:24,250
<span style="style.default_1">The image engraved in my heart</span>

913
01:00:24,333 --> 01:00:27,416
<span style="style.default_1">Is your face</span>

914
01:00:27,583 --> 01:00:28,875
<span style="style.default_1">I thought</span>

915
01:00:29,166 --> 01:00:34,291
<span style="style.default_1">I thought God called out to me,</span>

916
01:00:34,375 --> 01:00:39,583
<span style="style.default_1">But it ended up being you</span>

917
01:00:39,666 --> 01:00:44,541
<span style="style.default_1">My love</span>

918
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:50,000
<span style="style.default_1">My love</span>

919
01:00:50,291 --> 01:00:53,041
<span style="style.default_1">My love</span>

01:00:53,166 --> 01:00:57,875
<span style="style.default_1">My love</span>

921
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,916
<span style="style.default_1">My love</span>

922
01:01:01,041 --> 01:01:06,500
<span style="style.default_1">Morning, evening, day and night,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">In my mind it's always you</span>

923
01:01:06,583 --> 01:01:11,583
<span style="style.default_1">Quiver from head to toe,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">When I walk with you</span>

924
01:01:11,666 --> 01:01:17,208
<span style="style.default_1">Morning, evening, day and night,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">In my mind it's always you</span>

925
01:01:17,291 --> 01:01:22,416
<span style="style.default_1">I quiver from head to toe,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">When I walk with you</span>

926
01:01:22,583 --> 01:01:25,958
<span style="style.default_1">I quiver from head to toe</span>

927
01:01:27,416 --> 01:01:32,291
<span style="style.default_1">When you touched with affection,</span>

928
01:01:32,375 --> 01:01:35,416
<span style="style.default_1">My soul warmed up</span>

929
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:40,833
<span style="style.default_1">I thought</span>

930
01:01:40,916 --> 01:01:46,541
<span style="style.default_1">I thought God called out to me,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">But it ended up being you.</span>

931
01:01:46,625 --> 01:01:52,875
<span style="style.default_1">My love</span>

932
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,875
<span style="style.default_1">My love</span>

933
01:01:58,250 --> 01:02:03,041
<span style="style.default_1">My love</span>

934
01:02:03,166 --> 01:02:08,375
<span style="style.default_1">My love</span>

935
01:02:08,875 --> 01:02:14,166
<span style="style.default_1">I yearn for you like a bird</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Yearns for the sky</span>

936
01:02:14,291 --> 01:02:19,500
<span style="style.default_1">The moment you look away from me,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I will die</span>

937
01:02:19,583 --> 01:02:25,000
<span style="style.default_1">I yearn for you like a bird</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Yearns for the sky</span>

938
01:02:25,083 --> 01:02:30,250
<span style="style.default_1">The moment you look away</span>
<span style="style.default_1">From me, I will die</span>

939
01:02:30,333 --> 01:02:33,833
<span style="style.default_1">The moment you look away from me</span>

940
01:02:35,541 --> 01:02:43,458
<span style="style.default_1">Last night,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I bowed down to your house too</span>

941
01:02:43,541 --> 01:02:48,750
<span style="style.default_1">I thought</span>

942
01:02:48,833 --> 01:02:53,333
<span style="style.default_1">I thought God called out to me</span>

943
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:55,875
<span style="style.default_1">But it ended up being you</span>

944
01:02:55,958 --> 01:03:00,500
<span style="style.default_1">My love</span>

945
01:03:01,041 --> 01:03:07,291
<span style="style.default_1">My love</span>

946
01:03:07,625 --> 01:03:10,625
<span style="style.default_1">My love</span>

947
01:03:11,041 --> 01:03:16,291
<span style="style.default_1">My love</span>

948
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:28,958
Auntie,
you cook such delicious food.

949
01:03:29,291 --> 01:03:31,833
There is no way I can
stay away from that.

950
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:34,666
Do one thing, teach your daughter
how to cook like this.

951
01:03:35,083 --> 01:03:36,833
Because now I am always going
to eat food cooked by her.

952
01:03:43,041 --> 01:03:45,000
Please don't hit me with
the rolling pin.

953
01:03:46,250 --> 01:03:47,750
Auntie, my mother is no more.

954
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:49,583
But I've heard that
mothers know...

955
01:03:49,666 --> 01:03:51,291
...what makes her children happy.

956
01:03:53,416 --> 01:03:55,000
Bani and I will be
happy together.

957
01:03:55,625 --> 01:03:59,083
Don't worry. I'll first talk to
the SHO and then talk to Bani.

958
01:03:59,583 --> 01:04:01,250
Because I also need
to discuss dowry.

959
01:04:01,416 --> 01:04:03,208
I cannot survive if
I don't take dowry.

960
01:04:03,666 --> 01:04:05,125
And now give me 2000 rupees.

961
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:07,000
You won't let me leave
empty-handed now.

962
01:04:09,625 --> 01:04:11,333
POLICE STATION - PHASE 8 - MOHALI.

963
01:04:11,416 --> 01:04:12,541
Hello.

964
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,083
Hi.

965
01:04:15,875 --> 01:04:18,833
Uncle, I go to the lake
to run every day.

966
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:21,416
It's because I'd grown a paunch.

967
01:04:22,083 --> 01:04:24,458
I saw that your daughter
too comes there.

968
01:04:25,083 --> 01:04:26,916
But I go there because
of my health.

969
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:30,000
I just came to let you know so
that you don't misunderstand.

970
01:04:31,375 --> 01:04:32,458
Goodbye.

971
01:04:35,541 --> 01:04:36,750
Goodbye.

972
01:04:44,791 --> 01:04:46,708
Why do you keep yourselves rolled up?

973
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:50,500
Are you going to seize over some
property? Are you a goon?

974
01:04:51,583 --> 01:04:53,083
No, I am a saint then.

975
01:04:53,375 --> 01:04:55,708
I like peace.
I don't like fighting.

976
01:04:56,291 --> 01:04:58,625
Brother, give me ten rupees. May
God always keep you two together.

977
01:04:58,708 --> 01:05:00,541
May He bless you with
beautiful children.

978
01:05:01,125 --> 01:05:02,958
May God give you success.

979
01:05:05,875 --> 01:05:06,875
Here take this.

980
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,291
-Bye.
-Bless you.

981
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:13,541
She wouldn't have left otherwise.

982
01:05:21,708 --> 01:05:24,375
Bani, you know how much I have
changed after I met you?

983
01:05:25,291 --> 01:05:26,291
Get lost!

984
01:05:28,541 --> 01:05:30,125
-Really.
-Go away.

985
01:05:31,291 --> 01:05:34,125
A beautiful girl just
walked past us.

986
01:05:34,375 --> 01:05:36,500
She was wearing a pink top.

987
01:05:37,208 --> 01:05:39,375
It has stars on them.
A big star and a small star.

988
01:05:40,333 --> 01:05:42,125
Black color boots.

989
01:05:42,291 --> 01:05:45,083
She held a new phone cover of
Angry Birds in her hand.

990
01:05:45,458 --> 01:05:47,125
Did I notice her? No, I didn't.

991
01:05:50,125 --> 01:05:51,666
How much more did you
want to notice her?

992
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,875
Oh, God! Aren't you typical?

993
01:05:56,250 --> 01:05:57,541
A typical village boy.

994
01:05:57,625 --> 01:05:59,458
-They are addressed as Gabrus.
-Whatever.

995
01:06:00,125 --> 01:06:03,416
I'm a boy after all.
A creature of habit.

996
01:06:03,833 --> 01:06:05,583
I am being honest here.
I have really changed.

997
01:06:06,083 --> 01:06:07,500
No way!

998
01:06:12,166 --> 01:06:13,375
Fine, don't believe it.

999
01:06:26,458 --> 01:06:27,708
Let's go home, dear.

1000
01:06:33,666 --> 01:06:34,833
Just because I didn't
hang you upside down

1001
01:06:34,916 --> 01:06:37,916
and break your legs so you
thought that I am lenient?

1002
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:41,958
I purposely called you here.

1003
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,541
I wanted to show you how
happy Bani is with me.

1004
01:06:47,166 --> 01:06:48,500
Is it that easy?

1005
01:06:50,333 --> 01:06:52,083
We like each other.

1006
01:06:52,416 --> 01:06:54,208
Has my daughter ever
told you anything?

1007
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,500
I still haven't asked her.

1008
01:06:57,958 --> 01:07:00,500
I need to have your consent
before I have hers.

1009
01:07:03,166 --> 01:07:04,875
Is this a movie?

1010
01:07:05,875 --> 01:07:10,125
It will only take a minute to
file a case against you.

1011
01:07:10,416 --> 01:07:12,041
Your life will get ruined.

1012
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,833
It won't make any difference. I
have already flunked a few times.

1013
01:07:17,041 --> 01:07:18,416
She is a topper.

1014
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:21,166
Love isn't a shield that's
just worth 250 rupees

1015
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:22,958
which only
toppers can get.

1016
01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:30,833
I didn't mean that.
Don't misunderstand me.

1017
01:07:31,458 --> 01:07:33,166
I want everyone's consent.

1018
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:35,791
Otherwise, kids these days elope
before you even now it.

1019
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:38,875
Even the government.

1020
01:07:46,458 --> 01:07:48,166
Go, try to elope with her.

1021
01:07:49,291 --> 01:07:55,250
If you have your young love then
I have a father's pride.

1022
01:07:56,041 --> 01:08:01,583
Forget about running away, she won't
even take a step with you.

1023
01:08:02,208 --> 01:08:03,791
I didn't mean that.

1024
01:08:14,458 --> 01:08:16,541
<span style="style.default_1">That day I realized two things.</span>

1025
01:08:17,583 --> 01:08:20,333
<span style="style.default_1">One, as much as a father</span>
<span style="style.default_1">loves his daughter...</span>

1026
01:08:20,625 --> 01:08:22,708
<span style="style.default_1">no boy in the world can</span>
<span style="style.default_1">compete with that.</span>

1027
01:08:23,708 --> 01:08:25,750
<span style="style.default_1">Second, I won't be able</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to convince this SHO.</span>

1028
01:08:25,916 --> 01:08:27,250
<span style="style.default_1">Only his daughter</span>
<span style="style.default_1">can convince him.</span>

1029
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,625
<span style="style.default_1">I'll convince Bani and Bani</span>
<span style="style.default_1">will convince him.</span>

1030
01:08:42,458 --> 01:08:43,500
Here you go.

1031
01:08:46,125 --> 01:08:47,208
Shiva...

1032
01:08:47,375 --> 01:08:48,583
If you elope with a girl...

1033
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:50,000
I won't let you two
enter this house.

1034
01:08:53,083 --> 01:08:54,541
Aunt, do you think I'd do that?

1035
01:08:57,875 --> 01:09:00,291
Nothing is big for a person

1036
01:09:00,541 --> 01:09:02,208
who had attended his mother's funeral.

1037
01:09:07,708 --> 01:09:09,000
Your Shiva is very brave.

1038
01:09:10,375 --> 01:09:12,791
You don't need to worry
even if she refuses me.

1039
01:09:26,875 --> 01:09:28,458
Don't get beaten up.

1040
01:09:28,791 --> 01:09:32,833
I won't go to court with you if
they file a case against you.

1041
01:09:33,166 --> 01:09:34,583
You insisted on sending him
to Chandigarh, right?

1042
01:09:35,125 --> 01:09:36,833
He made it his Takht Hazara.

1043
01:09:36,916 --> 01:09:39,458
If I had slapped him and forced
him on a tractor...

1044
01:09:39,583 --> 01:09:40,875
he would have learnt
his lesson.

1045
01:09:41,125 --> 01:09:44,625
-I hope she doesn't fight much.
-He isn't responding now.

1046
01:09:45,041 --> 01:09:47,375
-Where is the girl from?
-I didn't do it on purpose.

1047
01:09:47,833 --> 01:09:49,083
I really didn't realize.

1048
01:09:49,166 --> 01:09:51,000
Your sister will find
someone else.

1049
01:09:51,083 --> 01:09:53,000
She has such nice teeth.

1050
01:09:53,708 --> 01:09:55,666
Whose girl is she?

1051
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:57,416
-Why aren't you answering?
-Serve dinner.

1052
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,333
Not to me, to him, or else
he will devour me.

1053
01:10:27,083 --> 01:10:28,125
Oh damn!

1054
01:10:41,083 --> 01:10:42,291
Should I show you a
marriage proposal?

1055
01:10:43,583 --> 01:10:46,125
I have already spoken to your
mother about it. She likes the boy.

1056
01:10:46,250 --> 01:10:47,875
You can talk to the SHO.

1057
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,500
I have already discussed
dowry too.

1058
01:10:49,583 --> 01:10:52,041
He doesn't want anything.
Not even a single penny.

1059
01:10:52,541 --> 01:10:54,458
But I won't forgot the
matchmaker's ring.

1060
01:10:54,541 --> 01:10:55,541
I want that.

1061
01:10:56,333 --> 01:10:57,458
The boy's photograph.

1062
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:10,625
There is no formality.
Your consent is important.

1063
01:11:11,041 --> 01:11:12,416
Do you like the boy or not?

1064
01:11:13,416 --> 01:11:14,416
And this...

1065
01:11:14,833 --> 01:11:17,541
That boy's mother had made a
sweater for her daughter-in-law.

1066
01:11:18,083 --> 01:11:19,583
If you like him then wear it.

1067
01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:22,083
The boy will know that you have
given your consent. Take it.

1068
01:11:23,125 --> 01:11:24,125
Take.

1069
01:11:30,458 --> 01:11:32,416
The boy's full name is
Shivjit Singh Gill.

1070
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:33,500
I am giving you his
full name because...

1071
01:11:33,708 --> 01:11:35,166
you will need it to print
it on the wedding invite.

1072
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:36,291
Shiva...

1073
01:11:39,083 --> 01:11:40,250
I am betrothed.

1074
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:52,000
My mother hasn't made that.

1075
01:11:52,083 --> 01:11:54,041
Old women make these in our
village for 250 rupees.

1076
01:11:54,833 --> 01:11:56,833
Who celebrates April fool's
day in November?

1077
01:11:57,541 --> 01:11:59,250
April fool's day is
not in November?

1078
01:12:00,125 --> 01:12:04,083
Oh no, I got April fooled then.

1079
01:12:06,083 --> 01:12:07,125
Who is the boy?

1080
01:12:07,208 --> 01:12:09,083
You ended up being more
eager than me.

1081
01:12:12,458 --> 01:12:14,375
He's my paternal aunt's relative.

1082
01:12:16,458 --> 01:12:17,666
Fine then. I'll get going.

1083
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:18,666
It is not right to meet on
the terrace like this now.

1084
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:20,250
I'll meet you downstairs, okay?

1085
01:12:21,041 --> 01:12:22,666
And this is not good,
I'll get you another one.

1086
01:12:22,750 --> 01:12:24,333
-I'll get you one in a darker shade.
-It's okay.

1087
01:13:18,708 --> 01:13:20,750
I think the gardener
didn't show up.

1088
01:13:34,875 --> 01:13:35,875
Yes?

1089
01:13:37,375 --> 01:13:39,166
Shiva proposed me.

1090
01:13:44,291 --> 01:13:46,208
Dear, you know what's better.

1091
01:13:46,458 --> 01:13:48,000
Is it of any good now?

1092
01:13:53,291 --> 01:13:54,875
I didn't say yes to him.

1093
01:14:01,083 --> 01:14:02,666
But Shiva is leaving
Chandigarh and...

1094
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:04,333
going back to his
village today.

1095
01:14:06,125 --> 01:14:07,375
Can I go and meet him?

1096
01:14:13,333 --> 01:14:16,541
Okay. But return before
your father returns.

1097
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:05,666
What happened?

1098
01:15:06,708 --> 01:15:08,083
Nothing. I am going back home.

1099
01:15:08,166 --> 01:15:09,333
I have some work there.

1100
01:15:11,708 --> 01:15:12,708
Liar.

1101
01:15:17,041 --> 01:15:18,291
Are you upset?

1102
01:15:19,416 --> 01:15:20,666
No, why would I be upset?

1103
01:15:22,416 --> 01:15:24,000
I respect our friendship.

1104
01:15:25,541 --> 01:15:26,833
It is my fault.

1105
01:15:27,958 --> 01:15:29,291
These useless feelings...

1106
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:31,791
The way boys behave...

1107
01:15:36,583 --> 01:15:38,791
<span style="style.default_1">You were the unfaithful</span>
<span style="style.default_1">who ruined my life...</span>

1108
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:40,583
It's nothing of that sort for me.

1109
01:15:41,625 --> 01:15:42,708
You are right at your place.

1110
01:15:47,916 --> 01:15:49,000
Are you trying to impress me?

1111
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:52,416
You aren't getting impressed.

1112
01:15:55,625 --> 01:15:57,083
The method is right.

1113
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:00,500
What's the use?

1114
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,000
It didn't help.

1115
01:16:14,833 --> 01:16:16,250
Will you attend my wedding?

1116
01:16:17,166 --> 01:16:19,666
Why do you want to ruin your
wedding by inviting me?

1117
01:16:21,208 --> 01:16:22,583
I'll start crying there.

1118
01:16:23,583 --> 01:16:26,833
If I start drinking and shouting
then it will cause trouble.

1119
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:37,541
Do you like the boy?

1120
01:16:41,125 --> 01:16:42,958
Did SHO ask you whether
you are happy?

1121
01:16:47,416 --> 01:16:48,916
He always did.

1122
01:16:53,458 --> 01:16:55,916
It doesn't matter if
he didn't once.

1123
01:17:06,916 --> 01:17:07,916
I'll get going.

1124
01:17:26,416 --> 01:17:28,166
I'm telling you I am a scoundrel.

1125
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,333
Today if you hug me
then I'll force...

1126
01:17:30,416 --> 01:17:31,666
you to board the train with me.

1127
01:17:32,291 --> 01:17:33,916
Your father will be left
searching for you.

1128
01:17:54,291 --> 01:17:56,208
And that sweater was actually
made by my mother.

1129
01:17:56,708 --> 01:17:58,083
Sister-in-law Anmol
has my address.

1130
01:17:58,583 --> 01:17:59,625
Please courier it.

1131
01:18:00,375 --> 01:18:01,666
It might have not meant
anything to you...

1132
01:18:02,166 --> 01:18:03,750
but it means the world to me.

1133
01:18:31,250 --> 01:18:37,083
If I am not close to you
Then who will be?

1134
01:18:37,208 --> 01:18:42,416
<span style="style.default_1">My soul will yearn,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">My heart will too weep</span>

1135
01:18:42,583 --> 01:18:48,041
<span style="style.default_1">If I am not close to you</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Then who will be?</span>

1136
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:53,541
<span style="style.default_1">My soul will yearn,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">My heart will too weep</span>

1137
01:18:53,708 --> 01:18:56,541
<span style="style.default_1">I won't like anything without you</span>

1138
01:18:56,625 --> 01:18:59,333
<span style="style.default_1">I will die my love</span>

1139
01:18:59,416 --> 01:19:02,083
<span style="style.default_1">I will go crazy</span>

1140
01:19:02,333 --> 01:19:05,000
<span style="style.default_1">I too will lose myself</span>

1141
01:19:05,083 --> 01:19:10,458
<span style="style.default_1">If we break up,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">God too shall weep</span>

1142
01:19:10,833 --> 01:19:16,416
<span style="style.default_1">If I am not close to you</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Then who will be?</span>

1143
01:19:16,791 --> 01:19:21,916
<span style="style.default_1">My soul will yearn,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">My heart will too weep</span>

1144
01:19:22,083 --> 01:19:27,791
<span style="style.default_1">If I am not close to you</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Then who will be?</span>

1145
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:33,291
<span style="style.default_1">My soul will yearn,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">My heart will too weep</span>

1146
01:19:33,666 --> 01:19:37,000
<span style="style.default_1">My heart will too weep.</span>

1147
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:05,250
She looks,
but doesn't let me copy.

1148
01:20:05,333 --> 01:20:09,791
Her father is very strict.
He'll beat her up.

1149
01:20:37,458 --> 01:20:38,791
Yes, how can I help you?

1150
01:20:39,083 --> 01:20:40,750
-Hello.
-Hello.

1151
01:20:41,208 --> 01:20:43,125
-I want to meet Aman.
-Which Aman, son?

1152
01:20:44,333 --> 01:20:45,708
Amandeep Kaur Dhillon.

1153
01:20:46,375 --> 01:20:47,916
She is from Jhindali.

1154
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:49,833
How is she related to you?

1155
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,583
She is my uncle's son's
sister-in-law.

1156
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:57,416
And she is also a good
friend of mine.

1157
01:21:04,083 --> 01:21:06,791
Look son,
your photo is not in the file.

1158
01:21:07,166 --> 01:21:08,416
You are just a friend of hers.

1159
01:21:08,708 --> 01:21:10,875
Sorry, I cannot let you meet her.

1160
01:21:14,416 --> 01:21:16,500
I can make you talk
to her family.

1161
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:21,166
Hello? Hello, auntie.

1162
01:21:21,250 --> 01:21:23,166
-Hello, son. Are you alright?
-Yes.

1163
01:21:23,458 --> 01:21:25,166
Please talk to Aman's warden.

1164
01:21:25,291 --> 01:21:26,458
-Please inform her.
-Okay son, give the phone to her.

1165
01:21:27,375 --> 01:21:28,208
Here.

1166
01:21:30,916 --> 01:21:31,750
Hello.

1167
01:21:31,833 --> 01:21:33,041
-Hello.
-Please send her with him.

1168
01:21:33,166 --> 01:21:35,416
We are planning to get the
two of them married.

1169
01:21:39,208 --> 01:21:41,875
Amandeep Kaur!
You have a visitor.

1170
01:21:42,250 --> 01:21:45,458
Auntie, what color turban
is the boy wearing?

1171
01:21:47,166 --> 01:21:50,041
College starts at ten,
please come back before that.

1172
01:21:50,750 --> 01:21:51,791
Okay.

1173
01:22:07,333 --> 01:22:09,375
Aman, what is this?

1174
01:22:09,625 --> 01:22:10,875
Where is your dress?

1175
01:22:12,708 --> 01:22:14,333
Ma'am,
it hasn't returned from laundry.

1176
01:22:14,416 --> 01:22:17,000
No! I won't allow you
to leave like this.

1177
01:22:17,083 --> 01:22:19,333
Wear your dress as
well as a sweater.

1178
01:22:19,416 --> 01:22:22,083
Just to be fashionable you will
end up catching a cold.

1179
01:22:38,166 --> 01:22:39,333
Hello, son.

1180
01:22:39,416 --> 01:22:40,333
Yes, auntie. Hi.

1181
01:22:40,541 --> 01:22:43,083
-Aman?
-Yes, she is here. Talk to her.

1182
01:22:46,750 --> 01:22:47,750
Yes, Aman.

1183
01:22:48,291 --> 01:22:49,666
Don't talk too much.

1184
01:22:49,750 --> 01:22:51,458
If he asks two questions,
answer only one.

1185
01:22:51,708 --> 01:22:53,125
If he tries to come closer...

1186
01:22:53,458 --> 01:22:54,875
Then I'll say no.

1187
01:22:55,083 --> 01:22:57,916
Don't say no. Say after marriage.

1188
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,666
What is he driving?

1189
01:22:59,958 --> 01:23:02,541
-An Enfield. Okay, I'll...
-An Enfield?

1190
01:23:02,791 --> 01:23:04,541
He has two cars at home.

1191
01:23:04,875 --> 01:23:07,333
We gifted them a Skoda
at Rajveer's wedding.

1192
01:23:07,416 --> 01:23:09,833
He has come on a motorbike
on purpose.

1193
01:23:09,916 --> 01:23:11,875
Boys these days...

1194
01:23:12,208 --> 01:23:15,500
But listen, you keep both
your legs on one side.

1195
01:23:15,625 --> 01:23:17,250
We are still discussing
a possible match...

1196
01:23:17,458 --> 01:23:18,541
we haven't fixed your
wedding with him yet.

1197
01:23:18,708 --> 01:23:20,125
Okay, fine. Bye.

1198
01:23:20,291 --> 01:23:22,166
At least hear me out.

1199
01:23:49,291 --> 01:23:50,458
Are you writing a name?

1200
01:23:51,958 --> 01:23:53,375
Write it on that dome there.

1201
01:23:54,291 --> 01:23:55,291
No.

1202
01:24:05,166 --> 01:24:06,833
Do you know that they are talking
about getting us married?

1203
01:24:08,416 --> 01:24:09,416
Yes.

1204
01:24:16,791 --> 01:24:17,666
Do you know who I am?

1205
01:24:19,625 --> 01:24:24,958
You are brother-in-law
Gurvinder's uncle's son.

1206
01:24:28,583 --> 01:24:29,583
That's enough to get married?

1207
01:24:30,833 --> 01:24:36,000
You too also know me as your
brother's sister-in-law.

1208
01:24:36,458 --> 01:24:40,750
If my family agrees,
and you like me, then it's okay.

1209
01:24:46,625 --> 01:24:48,916
That was two years ago.

1210
01:24:49,625 --> 01:24:51,375
So that means you don't
like me anymore.

1211
01:24:52,083 --> 01:24:54,625
-Talk to my family...
-No, it's not so.

1212
01:24:56,333 --> 01:24:59,333
Sister-in-law didn't tell you
want happened in Chandigarh?

1213
01:24:59,416 --> 01:25:01,541
She told me a few things.

1214
01:25:04,666 --> 01:25:06,500
It doesn't make a difference
to you?

1215
01:25:10,083 --> 01:25:12,083
I don't have a right before
we get married.

1216
01:25:12,333 --> 01:25:14,083
But if you do all this
after we get...

1217
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:15,958
married I'll have to decide...

1218
01:25:16,125 --> 01:25:17,625
whether I hang myself
from the ceiling...

1219
01:25:18,166 --> 01:25:20,000
fan or jump into the canal.

1220
01:25:20,791 --> 01:25:22,208
You don't want to know what
happened in the past two years?

1221
01:25:26,583 --> 01:25:27,875
Well, I want to tell you.

1222
01:25:28,041 --> 01:25:30,041
Before you learn it
from anyone else.

1223
01:25:30,541 --> 01:25:31,875
I want to tell you everything.

1224
01:25:43,083 --> 01:25:45,500
So, what happened to the girl who
was standing at the station?

1225
01:25:46,541 --> 01:25:48,458
Friendship and love
never get along.

1226
01:25:48,791 --> 01:25:50,541
We decided our relationship
into two parts.

1227
01:25:51,208 --> 01:25:53,208
She kept the friendship with her,
on that platform.

1228
01:25:54,083 --> 01:25:56,250
And I took the love with me,
on the train.

1229
01:25:56,458 --> 01:25:58,083
And where is she now?

1230
01:25:59,083 --> 01:26:00,250
I don't know.

1231
01:26:04,791 --> 01:26:06,166
I think you've talked enough.

1232
01:26:06,250 --> 01:26:07,875
It's time for your
class to begin.

1233
01:26:07,958 --> 01:26:10,291
Go, hurry up. Come on.

1234
01:26:13,958 --> 01:26:15,875
I felt nice that you
told me everything.

1235
01:26:16,625 --> 01:26:18,208
Otherwise,
nobody bothers to tell.

1236
01:26:19,083 --> 01:26:20,375
I'll get going now.

1237
01:27:41,916 --> 01:27:45,625
<span style="style.default_1">Is there something troubling you?</span>

1238
01:27:45,791 --> 01:27:49,375
<span style="style.default_1">I worry about you</span>

1239
01:27:49,666 --> 01:27:51,500
<span style="style.default_1">Is there something troubling you?</span>

1240
01:27:51,583 --> 01:27:53,375
<span style="style.default_1">I worry about you</span>

1241
01:27:53,541 --> 01:27:55,666
<span style="style.default_1">I don't know how you manage</span>

1242
01:27:55,750 --> 01:28:00,541
<span style="style.default_1">To survive with me as</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I couldn't without you</span>

1243
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:04,791
<span style="style.default_1">Come and meet me soon,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">My love...</span>

1244
01:28:04,875 --> 01:28:08,500
<span style="style.default_1">I am no good without you</span>

1245
01:28:08,666 --> 01:28:12,500
<span style="style.default_1">Come and meet me soon,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">My love...</span>

1246
01:28:12,583 --> 01:28:17,083
<span style="style.default_1">I am no good without you</span>

1247
01:28:24,208 --> 01:28:30,250
<span style="style.default_1">Come and meet me soon,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">My love...</span>

1248
01:28:31,708 --> 01:28:39,458
<span style="style.default_1">Come and meet me soon,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">My love...</span>

1249
01:28:39,666 --> 01:28:46,541
<span style="style.default_1">Come and meet me soon,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">My love...</span>

1250
01:29:21,375 --> 01:29:25,208
<span style="style.default_1">What I had thought and</span>
<span style="style.default_1">What has happened?</span>

1251
01:29:25,291 --> 01:29:29,166
<span style="style.default_1">God went to sleep when</span>
<span style="style.default_1">It was our turn</span>

1252
01:29:29,250 --> 01:29:35,666
<span style="style.default_1">So where do we go now?</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Who do we pray to?</span>

1253
01:29:36,750 --> 01:29:40,708
<span style="style.default_1">What I had thought and</span>
<span style="style.default_1">What has happened?</span>

1254
01:29:40,791 --> 01:29:44,583
<span style="style.default_1">God went to sleep when</span>
<span style="style.default_1">It was our turn</span>

1255
01:29:44,666 --> 01:29:48,958
<span style="style.default_1">So where do we go now?</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Who do we pray to?</span>

1256
01:29:49,041 --> 01:29:50,958
Where's 1147?

1257
01:29:53,541 --> 01:29:54,958
Here or at the top?

1258
01:29:59,916 --> 01:30:02,458
Why are you all smiles?
Did you hit a jackpot?

1259
01:30:04,583 --> 01:30:06,000
Why are you smiling?

1260
01:30:06,083 --> 01:30:07,458
<span style="style.default_1">Because I hit a jackpot.</span>

1261
01:30:07,750 --> 01:30:09,458
<span style="style.default_1">You look hotter than before.</span>

1262
01:30:11,041 --> 01:30:13,125
Decent boys don't look
in that manner.

1263
01:30:13,208 --> 01:30:14,708
Who says I am decent?

1264
01:30:15,041 --> 01:30:16,750
I'll hit a punch and break
all your teeth.

1265
01:30:25,375 --> 01:30:26,833
You are alone?

1266
01:30:28,166 --> 01:30:29,583
Your kids didn't come with you?

1267
01:30:31,041 --> 01:30:33,041
Not allowed to have kids
before the wedding.

1268
01:30:37,083 --> 01:30:38,166
Where are yours?

1269
01:30:43,916 --> 01:30:45,541
Who stands with you
in this state?

1270
01:30:47,541 --> 01:30:49,500
Even the best ones back out.

1271
01:30:51,083 --> 01:30:53,666
<span style="style.default_1">If you had given me the</span>
<span style="style.default_1">opportunity I would've stood by you.</span>

1272
01:30:54,416 --> 01:30:56,333
Stop talking with your eyes.

1273
01:30:57,625 --> 01:30:59,333
You started as soon as you came.

1274
01:31:01,958 --> 01:31:03,208
You have changed.

1275
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:04,750
No.

1276
01:31:07,375 --> 01:31:10,333
Such a beautiful nurse
just passed by you...

1277
01:31:10,958 --> 01:31:12,125
and you didn't even turn
around to look at her.

1278
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:13,833
It's not like that.

1279
01:31:14,166 --> 01:31:15,708
The receptionist downstairs
is more beautiful than her.

1280
01:31:20,041 --> 01:31:21,666
No, you have changed.

1281
01:31:24,291 --> 01:31:25,791
Your shirt is tucked in.

1282
01:31:26,541 --> 01:31:28,208
Your cuff buttons are closed.

1283
01:31:30,291 --> 01:31:32,083
Are you used to this
suffocation now?

1284
01:31:36,416 --> 01:31:39,208
She has stopped eating since
the past 15 days.

1285
01:31:40,625 --> 01:31:42,791
Both her kidneys are damaged.

1286
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,666
Kidney transplant is possible.

1287
01:31:48,708 --> 01:31:51,500
But there is a lot of infection
in her intestine and liver.

1288
01:31:52,208 --> 01:31:53,583
She hasn't been able to
recover from that.

1289
01:31:54,250 --> 01:31:56,333
We have been watching her
since the past one year.

1290
01:31:57,250 --> 01:31:58,916
There has been no improvement.

1291
01:32:00,916 --> 01:32:03,625
It is very easy for us to
say to take her home.

1292
01:32:04,666 --> 01:32:09,416
But her courage doesn't
let us lose hope.

1293
01:32:09,708 --> 01:32:10,958
Look at these reports.

1294
01:32:11,125 --> 01:32:13,291
We still don't understand how
come she is still alive.

1295
01:32:13,750 --> 01:32:15,625
Otherwise,
when people don't even stay...

1296
01:32:15,708 --> 01:32:17,250
conscious in this condition...

1297
01:32:17,750 --> 01:32:19,041
she is awake and talking.

1298
01:32:20,791 --> 01:32:25,916
Honestly speaking,
it's not us but a miracle...

1299
01:32:26,416 --> 01:32:28,666
which is keeping
her still alive.

1300
01:32:43,625 --> 01:32:45,250
Bani will get well, right?

1301
01:32:45,333 --> 01:32:47,000
What's wrong with her?
She is fine.

1302
01:32:47,083 --> 01:32:49,458
She is just making excuses
in order to not to work.

1303
01:32:49,541 --> 01:32:52,166
Papa says that she
won't live long.

1304
01:32:53,416 --> 01:32:55,458
Couldn't you get a better father?

1305
01:32:56,458 --> 01:32:58,708
He scares outsiders as
well as kids at home.

1306
01:33:05,166 --> 01:33:07,583
Come on, it's nothing serious.
She will get well soon.

1307
01:33:08,125 --> 01:33:09,125
Stupid girl.

1308
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:11,291
Come on now, smile for me.
Smile.

1309
01:33:11,666 --> 01:33:13,416
Show me, do you have cavities
in your teeth?

1310
01:33:16,791 --> 01:33:17,791
Come on.

1311
01:33:22,625 --> 01:33:24,000
You can leave. I'll stay here.

1312
01:33:24,083 --> 01:33:25,666
Get stuffed flatbreads
for breakfast.

1313
01:33:44,583 --> 01:33:47,250
I just gave her medicines.
She is asleep.

1314
01:33:47,333 --> 01:33:50,333
Don't wake her up or else she
will be restless all night long.

1315
01:33:50,416 --> 01:33:51,750
Okay?

1316
01:35:21,958 --> 01:35:23,208
What?

1317
01:35:24,916 --> 01:35:26,708
I am having trouble breathing.

1318
01:35:26,916 --> 01:35:28,833
The great actress is
having trouble.

1319
01:35:29,458 --> 01:35:30,833
Doctors say you won't make it.

1320
01:35:31,041 --> 01:35:32,250
Then why bother?

1321
01:35:38,916 --> 01:35:40,208
What are you doing, sir?

1322
01:35:40,375 --> 01:35:41,666
-Just...
-What?

1323
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:45,166
It's nothing.
Wait. Nothing happened.

1324
01:35:45,250 --> 01:35:46,583
You know we met after two years.

1325
01:35:46,666 --> 01:35:48,000
You know there are so many
things I have to say.

1326
01:35:48,250 --> 01:35:49,750
Who knows she might say
goodbye tomorrow.

1327
01:35:50,083 --> 01:35:51,333
I'll get blamed.

1328
01:35:51,458 --> 01:35:52,958
-But...
-It's okay.

1329
01:35:53,166 --> 01:35:54,333
Go and sit on that chair.

1330
01:35:54,416 --> 01:35:55,833
Come on sit down.
Nothing is going to happen.

1331
01:35:55,916 --> 01:35:57,291
Sit over here for two minutes.

1332
01:35:58,291 --> 01:35:59,291
Sit down.

1333
01:35:59,625 --> 01:36:01,083
Here, I'll hold the oxygen mask.

1334
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:03,416
I'll put it back on her when
she is about to die.

1335
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:05,000
It's placed here, right?

1336
01:36:06,208 --> 01:36:07,250
Get this straight.

1337
01:36:07,333 --> 01:36:09,291
If you die,
go straight to heaven.

1338
01:36:09,375 --> 01:36:11,083
Don't wander here as a ghost.

1339
01:36:12,625 --> 01:36:14,125
And don't you dare come after me.

1340
01:36:14,375 --> 01:36:16,916
We have a Baba in our village who
capture ghosts into bottles.

1341
01:36:17,666 --> 01:36:19,666
Don't say that I didn't warn you.
Do you understand?

1342
01:36:20,250 --> 01:36:21,458
It'll be this small
bottle and there...

1343
01:36:21,541 --> 01:36:24,125
will be a tiny you inside it.
He will place a cap on top of it.

1344
01:36:24,333 --> 01:36:25,916
It will be a wine bottle.

1345
01:36:29,125 --> 01:36:30,333
Laugh.

1346
01:36:32,416 --> 01:36:36,250
<span style="style.default_1">Come and meet me soon,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">My love</span>

1347
01:36:36,333 --> 01:36:41,750
<span style="style.default_1">I am no good without you</span>

1348
01:36:47,833 --> 01:36:54,083
<span style="style.default_1">Come and meet me soon,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">My love</span>

1349
01:36:55,500 --> 01:37:02,625
<span style="style.default_1">Come and meet me soon,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">My love</span>

1350
01:37:11,166 --> 01:37:12,666
What are you looking at, dear?

1351
01:37:16,166 --> 01:37:17,625
Parrots?

1352
01:37:17,916 --> 01:37:22,041
These red-winged parrots
are mountain parrots.

1353
01:37:22,666 --> 01:37:24,166
We too had one.

1354
01:37:24,416 --> 01:37:26,833
Father used to like them.

1355
01:37:28,333 --> 01:37:30,625
Your report that we
got today are good.

1356
01:37:30,708 --> 01:37:32,041
-Doctor said that...
-Papa...

1357
01:37:33,583 --> 01:37:36,041
I had gone to meet him even when
you had asked me not to.

1358
01:37:40,833 --> 01:37:43,083
You had said that life
means to keep going.

1359
01:37:45,541 --> 01:37:47,166
I had gone ahead.

1360
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,666
But everything has gone stand
still since the past 18 months.

1361
01:37:56,791 --> 01:37:58,958
We only talk about good reports.

1362
01:38:06,958 --> 01:38:08,333
I promised that I
wouldn't say yes.

1363
01:38:11,083 --> 01:38:12,916
I just wanted to meet him once.

1364
01:38:24,791 --> 01:38:28,000
BABA RAMDAS HOSPITAL, CHANDIGARH.

1365
01:38:46,875 --> 01:38:48,500
Madam, she is in pain.

1366
01:38:48,875 --> 01:38:51,083
Sir, she will feel a little pain.

1367
01:38:51,250 --> 01:38:53,041
She has a lot of weakness.

1368
01:39:15,083 --> 01:39:17,083
You really didn't do anything
with any boy?

1369
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:22,750
I mean you must have at
least kissed someone.

1370
01:39:26,333 --> 01:39:27,500
What's the use?

1371
01:39:27,625 --> 01:39:29,375
You know God has made
you so beautiful.

1372
01:39:29,666 --> 01:39:31,291
So many boys were
crazy about you.

1373
01:39:34,333 --> 01:39:35,666
You should have helped some
poor soul at least.

1374
01:39:37,041 --> 01:39:38,291
I met your doctor today.

1375
01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:40,125
He said she could go
any moment now.

1376
01:39:40,208 --> 01:39:41,375
Take her away.

1377
01:39:44,958 --> 01:39:48,541
Forgot anyone else, at least you
should have taken a feel.

1378
01:39:48,875 --> 01:39:50,250
You know how good it feels?

1379
01:39:53,125 --> 01:39:54,750
You can still do that, you know?

1380
01:39:55,625 --> 01:39:56,750
I am willing.

1381
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,708
This is the least
I can do for you.

1382
01:39:59,041 --> 01:40:00,250
You are my friend.

1383
01:40:02,916 --> 01:40:04,791
-Shiva, you have lost your mind.
-It's nothing.

1384
01:40:04,875 --> 01:40:06,750
-Shiva, someone might show up.
-No one is going to come.

1385
01:40:18,208 --> 01:40:19,625
You must have never
lied down with anyone.

1386
01:40:19,708 --> 01:40:21,833
-Move aside.
-Come on.

1387
01:40:23,791 --> 01:40:26,750
I am not going to drink your
glucose, you greedy woman.

1388
01:40:27,916 --> 01:40:29,000
Are you comfortable?

1389
01:40:29,791 --> 01:40:30,875
Like this.

1390
01:40:31,791 --> 01:40:33,500
If papa shows up,
he will beat you up.

1391
01:40:33,583 --> 01:40:34,541
Nothing is going to happen.

1392
01:40:34,625 --> 01:40:36,291
Your father has gone to
the police station.

1393
01:40:36,500 --> 01:40:39,625
You should know how much fun it
is to sleep on a man's arm.

1394
01:40:40,166 --> 01:40:41,458
Place your leg on mine.

1395
01:40:41,708 --> 01:40:43,625
Do it. Come on, do it.

1396
01:40:43,708 --> 01:40:44,916
Like this.

1397
01:40:45,375 --> 01:40:46,666
Are you feeling it?

1398
01:40:49,166 --> 01:40:51,791
-Oh no.
-Ma'am, it's done.

1399
01:40:57,166 --> 01:40:58,750
I had heard that men hate love,
but...

1400
01:40:58,833 --> 01:41:00,291
the nurses hate it as well.

1401
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:02,833
I am seeing for
the first time.

1402
01:41:02,916 --> 01:41:06,166
She is jealous of you,
because I love you.

1403
01:41:08,125 --> 01:41:09,500
Are you okay? Are you having fun?

1404
01:41:09,791 --> 01:41:11,083
You are crying again?

1405
01:41:14,083 --> 01:41:16,458
Lift your leg, it's quite heavy,
you mouse. Lift it.

1406
01:41:18,833 --> 01:41:19,958
Smile.

1407
01:41:21,625 --> 01:41:23,208
You are anyway going to die.

1408
01:41:26,083 --> 01:41:27,791
I won't let you die like this.

1409
01:41:32,208 --> 01:41:33,666
Stop it now.

1410
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:36,416
You are a big feeler.

1411
01:41:38,750 --> 01:41:40,083
Stop it.

1412
01:42:56,500 --> 01:42:58,500
What are you doing, sir?

1413
01:43:04,125 --> 01:43:06,416
Nothing. You know she loves
these planets and flowers.

1414
01:43:07,708 --> 01:43:09,166
You will get me a scolding.

1415
01:43:09,250 --> 01:43:10,375
This is a hospital.

1416
01:43:10,791 --> 01:43:12,750
First, get these pots
out of the room.

1417
01:43:13,458 --> 01:43:14,541
Then remove them.

1418
01:43:15,333 --> 01:43:17,291
I should? Why should I?

1419
01:43:17,708 --> 01:43:20,250
Then why should I? You will be
scolded, why should I care?

1420
01:43:32,083 --> 01:43:33,875
Where is God?

1421
01:43:33,958 --> 01:43:35,916
He is painting walls here.

1422
01:44:04,458 --> 01:44:07,083
<span style="style.default_1">Your memories haunt me</span>

1423
01:44:07,291 --> 01:44:10,041
<span style="style.default_1">There is no peace for me</span>

1424
01:44:10,125 --> 01:44:12,916
<span style="style.default_1">On my body, my love...</span>

1425
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,750
<span style="style.default_1">I can smell you</span>

1426
01:44:15,833 --> 01:44:18,458
<span style="style.default_1">Your memories haunt me</span>

1427
01:44:18,625 --> 01:44:21,333
<span style="style.default_1">There is no peace for me</span>

1428
01:44:21,416 --> 01:44:24,166
<span style="style.default_1">On my body, my love</span>

1429
01:44:24,250 --> 01:44:26,708
<span style="style.default_1">I can smell you</span>

1430
01:44:26,791 --> 01:44:29,000
<span style="style.default_1">Whether I stay awake</span>

1431
01:44:29,083 --> 01:44:32,375
<span style="style.default_1">Or asleep</span>

1432
01:44:32,625 --> 01:44:37,916
<span style="style.default_1">Your thoughts surround me</span>

1433
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:43,750
<span style="style.default_1">O wanderer</span>

1434
01:44:43,916 --> 01:44:49,041
<span style="style.default_1">Take me along with you</span>

1435
01:44:49,125 --> 01:44:55,083
<span style="style.default_1">This world seems untrue...</span>

1436
01:44:55,166 --> 01:45:00,500
<span style="style.default_1">My love, without you</span>

1437
01:45:00,583 --> 01:45:06,375
<span style="style.default_1">O wanderer</span>

1438
01:45:06,458 --> 01:45:13,750
<span style="style.default_1">Take me along with you</span>

1439
01:45:26,750 --> 01:45:32,083
<span style="style.default_1">I will get lost in this</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Crowded world, my love</span>

1440
01:45:32,333 --> 01:45:37,791
<span style="style.default_1">Without you,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I will go crazy, my love</span>

1441
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:43,500
<span style="style.default_1">I will get lost in this</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Crowded world, my love</span>

1442
01:45:43,625 --> 01:45:48,375
<span style="style.default_1">Without you,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I will go crazy, my love</span>

1443
01:45:48,458 --> 01:45:54,291
<span style="style.default_1">If you go away from me</span>

1444
01:45:54,458 --> 01:45:59,791
<span style="style.default_1">My life will wither away</span>

1445
01:45:59,875 --> 01:46:05,708
<span style="style.default_1">O wanderer</span>

1446
01:46:05,791 --> 01:46:13,166
<span style="style.default_1">Take me along with you</span>

1447
01:46:37,291 --> 01:46:42,916
<span style="style.default_1">Pain has managed to suppress</span>
<span style="style.default_1">All my happiness away</span>

1448
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,833
<span style="style.default_1">God couldn't find a better candidate</span>

1449
01:46:45,916 --> 01:46:48,375
<span style="style.default_1">For sorrows coming in the way?</span>

1450
01:46:48,583 --> 01:46:54,000
<span style="style.default_1">Pain has managed to suppress</span>
<span style="style.default_1">All my happiness away</span>

1451
01:46:54,083 --> 01:46:56,625
<span style="style.default_1">God couldn't find a better candidate</span>

1452
01:46:56,708 --> 01:46:58,916
<span style="style.default_1">For sorrows coming in the way?</span>

1453
01:46:59,083 --> 01:47:04,791
<span style="style.default_1">Dead are all those questions</span>

1454
01:47:04,916 --> 01:47:10,333
<span style="style.default_1">That I needed to ask you</span>

1455
01:47:10,416 --> 01:47:16,208
<span style="style.default_1">O wanderer</span>

1456
01:47:16,291 --> 01:47:23,291
<span style="style.default_1">Take me along with you</span>

1457
01:47:24,416 --> 01:47:32,583
Who will think about me after
you are gone, my love?

1458
01:47:50,625 --> 01:47:52,541
Now you like parrots
more than me?

1459
01:47:59,083 --> 01:48:00,083
Hey!

1460
01:48:06,041 --> 01:48:07,125
So, tell me something.

1461
01:48:07,666 --> 01:48:08,916
You say.

1462
01:48:09,083 --> 01:48:10,208
What should I say?

1463
01:48:10,833 --> 01:48:13,375
You aren't Sidhu Moose Wala,
that I ask you to sing me a song.

1464
01:48:14,166 --> 01:48:15,333
Then you on your with
nonsense instead.

1465
01:48:15,416 --> 01:48:17,375
I can sing. Should I sing?

1466
01:48:20,791 --> 01:48:23,541
<span style="style.default_1">You used to smile like a rose</span>

1467
01:48:23,625 --> 01:48:25,958
<span style="style.default_1">You used to wait for me</span>

1468
01:48:26,291 --> 01:48:33,291
<span style="style.default_1">You sever all ties of love,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">By rejecting me</span>

1469
01:48:33,583 --> 01:48:35,833
<span style="style.default_1">You will seek me later</span>

1470
01:48:40,750 --> 01:48:41,791
<span style="style.default_1">Should I go on?</span>

1471
01:48:46,125 --> 01:48:49,250
<span style="style.default_1">My love, a garden, has withered</span>

1472
01:48:49,750 --> 01:48:53,000
<span style="style.default_1">My love, a garden, has withered</span>

1473
01:48:53,916 --> 01:48:57,583
<span style="style.default_1">Where are you, spreading your fragrance?</span>

1474
01:48:58,916 --> 01:49:06,625
<span style="style.default_1">You are still missed by</span>
<span style="style.default_1">This unfortunate lover</span>

1475
01:49:10,916 --> 01:49:12,083
Should I go on?

1476
01:49:12,416 --> 01:49:13,708
I know many more couplets.

1477
01:49:18,208 --> 01:49:23,333
<span style="style.default_1">You left the lover boy who</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Was crazy about you</span>

1478
01:49:23,625 --> 01:49:28,375
<span style="style.default_1">Wearing torn clothes he wanders</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Around at your wedding</span>

1479
01:49:30,083 --> 01:49:35,291
<span style="style.default_1">He keeps chanting your name,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">He is so madly in love</span>

1480
01:49:35,458 --> 01:49:37,666
<span style="style.default_1">After being separated from you...</span>

1481
01:49:37,750 --> 01:49:40,541
<span style="style.default_1">He has started drinking neat alcohol</span>

1482
01:49:41,666 --> 01:49:42,666
So?

1483
01:49:43,833 --> 01:49:44,916
Aren't I good?

1484
01:49:46,833 --> 01:49:48,166
Say yes at least now.

1485
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:50,875
<span style="style.default_1">You keep saying that I am going</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to die in 15 days anyway.</span>

1486
01:49:51,958 --> 01:49:53,541
<span style="style.default_1">Then why do you want</span>
<span style="style.default_1">me to say "yes?"</span>

1487
01:49:58,083 --> 01:50:01,000
So what? I am eying your
flat in Chandigarh.

1488
01:50:03,291 --> 01:50:04,958
Transfer it to my name.

1489
01:50:06,083 --> 01:50:07,166
Please do it.

1490
01:50:09,125 --> 01:50:12,291
Our lives would have been ruined
if I had said yes to you.

1491
01:50:13,333 --> 01:50:14,833
You didn't clear your graduation.

1492
01:50:15,333 --> 01:50:17,916
You would have starved and
made me starve as well.

1493
01:50:18,833 --> 01:50:20,041
Why wouldn't it be ruined?

1494
01:50:20,125 --> 01:50:21,833
It would only be a
little different.

1495
01:50:31,541 --> 01:50:33,666
Here, have some tea, you are
getting late for office.

1496
01:50:36,333 --> 01:50:37,416
Tea?

1497
01:50:47,083 --> 01:50:48,666
Get up dear,
your school van is here.

1498
01:50:48,750 --> 01:50:49,833
Get up. Smile, smile, smile.

1499
01:50:51,458 --> 01:50:52,541
Very good.

1500
01:50:52,750 --> 01:50:54,541
Wake up. Wake her up, okay?

1501
01:51:06,750 --> 01:51:08,875
Come here already or else I will
get late today as well.

1502
01:51:09,250 --> 01:51:11,666
-Let's go. Let's go.
-Takes an hour to tie two plaits.

1503
01:51:11,750 --> 01:51:13,583
-Get in, get in, get in.
-Get in quickly, kids.

1504
01:51:13,666 --> 01:51:15,083
I have made black grams
with curry today.

1505
01:51:15,166 --> 01:51:16,125
Keep the tiffin box straight
or it will spill.

1506
01:51:16,208 --> 01:51:17,416
Nothing will happen.

1507
01:51:20,625 --> 01:51:21,916
Come on, say bye to papa.

1508
01:51:24,958 --> 01:51:25,958
They left.

1509
01:51:26,708 --> 01:51:29,083
My wife doesn't meet me before she leaves.

1510
01:51:33,208 --> 01:51:34,875
Your sister was better,
sister-in-law.

1511
01:51:35,125 --> 01:51:36,833
I got trapped by getting
married to her.

1512
01:51:38,083 --> 01:51:39,333
What's so urgent?

1513
01:51:39,416 --> 01:51:41,500
A wife can call at least once
during the day, right?

1514
01:51:44,125 --> 01:51:45,833
-My daughter is back!
-Yes.

1515
01:51:45,916 --> 01:51:48,958
Come here, come here!

1516
01:51:51,541 --> 01:51:53,416
-Yes.
-Son, serve some water to her.

1517
01:51:53,500 --> 01:51:55,250
She must have returned
tired from her job.

1518
01:51:55,333 --> 01:51:56,875
What benefit do I get of her job?

1519
01:51:57,083 --> 01:51:58,375
I spent the whole year wearing
just two turbans.

1520
01:51:58,500 --> 01:52:02,041
You have a beautiful and educated wife.
You are lucky.

1521
01:52:02,125 --> 01:52:04,000
-Mummy, chocolate.
-Look, your mother is back.

1522
01:52:04,083 --> 01:52:05,875
My great wife is back from work.

1523
01:52:07,041 --> 01:52:09,041
Why did you get me a phone
when you don't call me?

1524
01:52:09,166 --> 01:52:11,166
Move it, girls. Mummy's darlings.
Come here with me.

1525
01:52:11,291 --> 01:52:13,333
-And you too follow me.
-No mummy!

1526
01:52:13,416 --> 01:52:14,375
Come on.

1527
01:52:47,625 --> 01:52:48,833
So now you miss me.

1528
01:52:49,791 --> 01:52:51,666
You only love your children.

1529
01:52:51,750 --> 01:52:52,708
Whether anyone else lives
or dies doesn't...

1530
01:52:52,791 --> 01:52:54,375
make any difference to you.

1531
01:52:54,583 --> 01:52:56,250
Don't come any closer.

1532
01:52:57,125 --> 01:52:58,125
Move back.

1533
01:53:16,958 --> 01:53:18,208
I don't want them.

1534
01:53:22,500 --> 01:53:25,000
Why don't you just say that
you are bored of me?

1535
01:53:27,541 --> 01:53:28,791
Oh my...

1536
01:53:29,333 --> 01:53:30,791
At least show me your face.

1537
01:53:31,875 --> 01:53:34,291
I know that you liked them.

1538
01:53:34,958 --> 01:53:36,791
Show me your face.

1539
01:53:39,416 --> 01:53:42,208
-Go to sleep, my dear.
-Make him sleep.

1540
01:53:43,083 --> 01:53:44,208
Go to sleep, dear.

1541
01:53:44,458 --> 01:53:45,833
He will sleep when he has to.

1542
01:53:46,333 --> 01:53:48,833
You were the one who cursed me.
That I will have seven daughters.

1543
01:53:49,208 --> 01:53:51,083
I have three so far,
so, expect four more.

1544
01:53:51,458 --> 01:53:52,833
Go to sleep, my child.

1545
01:53:55,833 --> 01:53:57,083
Go to sleep.

1546
01:55:11,875 --> 01:55:13,833
Buy yourself a ticket.

1547
01:55:15,250 --> 01:55:16,916
It's time you leave.

1548
01:55:22,791 --> 01:55:24,083
I won't leave.

1549
01:55:27,875 --> 01:55:29,958
Then I will tell Bani
the truth about you.

1550
01:55:59,666 --> 01:56:04,041
Look, it took Shiva a lot
of time to get over her.

1551
01:56:06,958 --> 01:56:08,500
They got engaged today.

1552
01:56:09,250 --> 01:56:10,916
They will get married
in two months.

1553
01:56:17,250 --> 01:56:18,916
They are related now.

1554
01:56:19,541 --> 01:56:21,875
You misunderstand, sir.

1555
01:56:22,583 --> 01:56:24,625
I don't know whether
my daughter will...

1556
01:56:25,125 --> 01:56:26,583
even survive the next 15 days.

1557
01:56:29,375 --> 01:56:31,416
I couldn't say no to her.

1558
01:56:33,458 --> 01:56:34,958
But don't you worry.

1559
01:56:35,500 --> 01:56:40,166
I'll make sure your son comes
back just as he had left.

1560
01:56:41,666 --> 01:56:47,166
<span style="style.default_1">If I am not close to you</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Then who will be?</span>

1561
01:56:47,666 --> 01:56:52,875
<span style="style.default_1">My soul will yearn,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">My heart will too weep</span>

1562
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:58,666
<span style="style.default_1">If I am not close to you</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Then who will be?</span>

1563
01:56:58,958 --> 01:57:05,291
<span style="style.default_1">My soul will yearn,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">My heart will too weep</span>

1564
01:57:07,541 --> 01:57:09,125
She will die.

1565
01:57:11,958 --> 01:57:13,375
Let her die.

1566
01:57:14,500 --> 01:57:15,833
She is my daughter.

1567
01:57:19,083 --> 01:57:22,666
I cannot ruin anyone else's life
for my daughter's sake.

1568
01:57:26,041 --> 01:57:30,541
Earlier I thought that you
weren't right for my daughter.

1569
01:57:33,166 --> 01:57:37,791
But now I know that my daughter
isn't right for you.

1570
01:57:40,125 --> 01:57:44,333
Call home and agree to
the wedding date.

1571
01:57:47,083 --> 01:57:49,750
I promise I won't tell
Bani anything.

1572
01:58:01,791 --> 01:58:03,375
Shiva, when are you going back?

1573
01:58:04,041 --> 01:58:05,541
You have been here since
quite a few days now.

1574
01:58:06,458 --> 01:58:08,000
I am sure your family must
be waiting for you.

1575
01:58:13,291 --> 01:58:14,750
Good that you came here.

1576
01:58:16,541 --> 01:58:18,125
It was getting difficult
to survive each day.

1577
01:58:20,083 --> 01:58:22,333
After you came, I didn't realize
how two months passed away.

1578
01:58:24,125 --> 01:58:26,333
I am back to the life
I had in Sector 50.

1579
01:58:33,208 --> 01:58:34,416
Get married now.

1580
01:58:35,416 --> 01:58:37,916
If you grow old, no one would
give his daughter to you.

1581
01:58:40,250 --> 01:58:41,666
Should I talk to the nurse?

1582
01:58:42,291 --> 01:58:43,625
She is very beautiful.

1583
01:58:46,750 --> 01:58:48,250
You don't think she is beautiful?

1584
01:58:49,833 --> 01:58:51,208
As if you are Gary Sandhu.

1585
01:58:53,458 --> 01:58:54,666
Get married.

1586
01:58:55,208 --> 01:58:57,041
I'll get to at least see
your wedding sweets.

1587
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:01,916
Bani, I am getting married
after four days.

1588
01:59:10,916 --> 01:59:12,250
Who is the unfortunate one?

1589
01:59:16,375 --> 01:59:17,875
Your brother's sister-in-law?

1590
01:59:19,708 --> 01:59:20,708
Right?

1591
01:59:22,291 --> 01:59:23,625
Oh.

1592
01:59:29,875 --> 01:59:31,333
I didn't expect that from you.

1593
01:59:32,958 --> 01:59:34,958
You turned out to be quite loyal,
Shivjit Singh.

1594
01:59:36,416 --> 01:59:38,041
<span style="style.default_1">You really aren't</span>
<span style="style.default_1">going to stop me?</span>

1595
01:59:39,666 --> 01:59:40,750
<span style="style.default_1">Are you crazy?</span>

1596
01:59:42,666 --> 01:59:44,708
<span style="style.default_1">When I didn't stop you back</span>
<span style="style.default_1">then, why would I stop you now?</span>

1597
01:59:46,541 --> 01:59:48,291
<span style="style.default_1">Don't think about</span>
<span style="style.default_1">stupid things.</span>

1598
01:59:50,083 --> 01:59:52,083
<span style="style.default_1">Whatever that happens,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">happens for the best.</span>

1599
01:59:52,833 --> 01:59:55,916
<span style="style.default_1">There is no better line in the</span>
<span style="style.default_1">world to console the heart.</span>

1600
01:59:56,458 --> 01:59:58,166
<span style="style.default_1">Our story couldn't come through,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Bani.</span>

1601
01:59:58,250 --> 01:59:59,250
<span style="style.default_1">It's okay.</span>

1602
02:00:00,666 --> 02:00:02,791
<span style="style.default_1">This isn't the end for us.</span>

1603
02:00:04,875 --> 02:00:06,041
<span style="style.default_1">We shall meet again.</span>

1604
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,416
<span style="style.default_1">In some other lifetime.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">On some other rooftop.</span>

1605
02:00:34,041 --> 02:00:39,625
<span style="style.default_1">I need you, my love...</span>

1606
02:00:39,708 --> 02:00:45,333
<span style="style.default_1">Just like a fish needs water</span>

1607
02:00:45,416 --> 02:00:50,958
<span style="style.default_1">Just like a fish needs water</span>

1608
02:00:51,083 --> 02:00:53,750
<span style="style.default_1">You are the destination</span>
<span style="style.default_1">And I am the path</span>

1609
02:00:53,833 --> 02:00:56,541
<span style="style.default_1">No one can separate us</span>

1610
02:00:56,625 --> 02:01:02,166
<span style="style.default_1">Just as there can be no morning</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Without the sun</span>

1611
02:01:02,291 --> 02:01:07,750
<span style="style.default_1">God will heal my wounds,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">brave you must be.</span>

1612
02:01:07,916 --> 02:01:13,541
<span style="style.default_1">If I am not close to you</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Then who will be?</span>

1613
02:01:13,833 --> 02:01:19,000
<span style="style.default_1">My soul will yearn,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">My heart will too weep</span>

1614
02:01:19,208 --> 02:01:24,791
<span style="style.default_1">If I am not close to you</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Then who will be?</span>

1615
02:01:25,083 --> 02:01:30,666
<span style="style.default_1">My soul will yearn,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">My heart will too weep</span>

1616
02:01:49,416 --> 02:01:50,791
Are you done with shopping?

1617
02:01:51,791 --> 02:01:52,791
Yes.

1618
02:01:54,833 --> 02:01:57,208
Everything else is fine?

1619
02:01:57,541 --> 02:01:58,541
Yes, fine.

1620
02:02:00,125 --> 02:02:01,500
How is she?

1621
02:02:02,958 --> 02:02:04,000
Fine.

1622
02:02:05,166 --> 02:02:06,666
Was she happy to see you?

1623
02:02:09,708 --> 02:02:10,708
Yes.

1624
02:02:11,333 --> 02:02:12,833
How was her husband?

1625
02:02:19,166 --> 02:02:20,500
You don't want to talk?

1626
02:02:23,583 --> 02:02:25,541
Sorry,
I don't intend to trouble you.

1627
02:02:26,666 --> 02:02:29,250
I have hardly ever called you.

1628
02:02:31,166 --> 02:02:33,500
But now I feel as if I know her.

1629
02:02:35,416 --> 02:02:37,916
Please tell me, is she fine?

1630
02:03:00,541 --> 02:03:01,791
Mr. Gurnam?

1631
02:03:03,916 --> 02:03:06,250
This is the first time I see
improvement in Bani's reports.

1632
02:03:06,500 --> 02:03:09,208
It's great news that she has
started recovering now.

1633
02:03:09,541 --> 02:03:11,416
If she keeps recovering
like this

1634
02:03:11,500 --> 02:03:13,625
then we can think about getting
a transplant as well.

1635
02:03:14,333 --> 02:03:15,333
Yes.

1636
02:03:15,833 --> 02:03:18,125
Nurse? Which doctor is on
duty in the morning?

1637
02:03:18,208 --> 02:03:19,916
-Dr. Sharma.
-Okay.

1638
02:03:41,791 --> 02:03:43,791
Why are you so sad, papa?

1639
02:03:52,583 --> 02:03:54,666
I didn't say yes to him.

1640
02:03:59,583 --> 02:04:01,958
He pleaded me today as well.

1641
02:04:07,750 --> 02:04:08,875
But I...

1642
02:04:36,791 --> 02:04:38,458
Get comfortable.

1643
02:04:48,833 --> 02:04:50,125
Honestly speaking...

1644
02:04:56,083 --> 02:04:58,375
this time I didn't say no
to him because of you.

1645
02:05:01,458 --> 02:05:03,791
Only if I had a little
more time to live.

1646
02:05:05,833 --> 02:05:08,916
Then your daughter would've
dishonored you, Gurnam Singh.

1647
02:05:35,166 --> 02:05:36,458
Enough now.

1648
02:06:08,791 --> 02:06:10,541
-Shiva, have a look.
-Yes.

1649
02:06:10,916 --> 02:06:12,875
-It this nice?
-Yes.

1650
02:06:13,791 --> 02:06:15,375
Will you tie this color's turban?

1651
02:06:15,625 --> 02:06:17,250
I hope it's not too red for you.

1652
02:06:17,750 --> 02:06:18,750
It's fine.

1653
02:06:23,958 --> 02:06:25,291
Shiva, tell me something.

1654
02:06:28,291 --> 02:06:33,291
Can you ever for me feel the
way you feel for Bani?

1655
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:43,000
You know if you don't
wrong me now...

1656
02:06:43,375 --> 02:06:45,583
then you will be wrong
all your life.

1657
02:06:46,833 --> 02:06:51,083
The doctor had said that
it's a miracle...

1658
02:06:51,625 --> 02:06:53,750
which has kept her alive.

1659
02:06:54,625 --> 02:06:56,333
And that miracle is you.

1660
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:01,041
She is still somewhere...

1661
02:07:01,916 --> 02:07:05,000
living with a hope that
you are there for her.

1662
02:07:07,500 --> 02:07:13,208
But if she loses this hope
then she will die.

1663
02:07:18,375 --> 02:07:20,666
Well, I won't die for you.

1664
02:07:21,875 --> 02:07:23,750
And I am sure I will
find someone else.

1665
02:07:24,333 --> 02:07:26,166
More so those who are
not even graduates.

1666
02:07:31,083 --> 02:07:34,541
The condition she is in,
she won't accept you.

1667
02:07:35,500 --> 02:07:37,750
You will have to make
a claim on her.

1668
02:07:38,500 --> 02:07:40,875
Hence,
don't worry about me and go.

1669
02:08:17,791 --> 02:08:20,250
ON SALE.

1670
02:08:30,583 --> 02:08:31,916
-Brother?
-Yes, brother?

1671
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:32,833
-Do you have a band?
-Yes, I do.

1672
02:08:32,916 --> 02:08:33,833
For when do you want to book it?

1673
02:08:33,916 --> 02:08:35,166
-Right away.
-What?

1674
02:08:35,333 --> 02:08:36,916
-Do you have a car?
-Yes, I do.

1675
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:38,666
-Then let's go to Manali.
-What?

1676
02:08:39,166 --> 02:08:42,875
<span style="style.default_1">Come and meet me soon,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">My love...</span>

<span style="style.default_1">I won't let you die like this,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">My beloved</span>

1680

<span style="style.default_1">I won't let you die like this,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">My beloved</span>

1681
02:09:05,916 --> 02:09:12,000
<span style="style.default_1">I won't let live a single moment more,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Without me</span>

1682
02:09:13,375 --> 02:09:17,166
<span style="style.default_1">Come and meet me soon,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">My love...</span>

1683
02:09:17,250 --> 02:09:20,791
<span style="style.default_1">I am no good without you</span>

1684
02:09:21,083 --> 02:09:24,958
<span style="style.default_1">Come and meet me soon,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">My love...</span>

1685

<span style="style.default_1">Come and meet me soon,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">My love...</span>

1687
02:09:44,250 --> 02:09:50,833
<span style="style.default_1">Come and meet me soon,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">My love...</span>

1688
02:09:54,750 --> 02:09:57,166
She will sit up there to watch
the parrots at dawn.

1689
02:09:57,541 --> 02:09:59,333
You should start playing
immediately, got it?

1690
02:09:59,875 --> 02:10:01,458
Do you know any songs
about parrot?

1691
02:10:02,125 --> 02:10:04,416
Then play the song about the
pigeon. The pigeon song.

1692
02:10:05,500 --> 02:10:07,166
No! Not the pigeon song.
Play the song...

1693
02:10:07,250 --> 02:10:09,708
<span style="style.default_1">Your unfortunate lover</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Still misses you</span>

1694
02:10:10,583 --> 02:10:16,750
-Play it well, okay?
-<span style="style.default_1">I am no good without you</span>

<span style="style.default_1">My love...</span>

1697
02:10:55,833 --> 02:11:00,166
<span style="style.default_1">I feel that when you are really</span>
<span style="style.default_1">in love, it rains.</span>

1698
02:12:43,083 --> 02:12:46,916
This sweater is for you.

1699
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:48,125
Please wear it if you like it.

1700
02:12:48,583 --> 02:12:50,750
This is a token of love.

1701
02:12:56,541 --> 02:13:02,083
<span style="style.default_1">I am leaving,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Hold on to hope, my love</span>

1702
02:13:02,250 --> 02:13:07,875
<span style="style.default_1">Don't embrace my dead body</span>
<span style="style.default_1">And cry, my love</span>

1703
02:13:07,958 --> 02:13:11,416
<span style="style.default_1">Don't cry, my love</span>

1704
02:13:13,416 --> 02:13:19,041
<span style="style.default_1">God will heal my wounds,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Brave you must be</span>

1705
02:13:19,125 --> 02:13:24,750
<span style="style.default_1">If I am not close to you</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Then who will be?"</span>

1706
02:13:25,083 --> 02:13:30,166
<span style="style.default_1">My soul will yearn,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">My heart will too weep</span>

1707
02:13:30,458 --> 02:13:36,083
<span style="style.default_1">If I am not close to you</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Then who will be?</span>

1708
02:13:36,333 --> 02:13:41,750

1710
02:13:55,666 --> 02:13:58,375
<span style="style.default_1">You are the moon</span>
<span style="style.default_1">And I am a star</span>

1711
02:13:58,458 --> 02:14:04,000
<span style="style.default_1">You are the sea and</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I am its shore</span>

1712
02:14:04,083 --> 02:14:09,541
<span style="style.default_1">Who will sleep in your arms?</span>

1713
02:14:09,833 --> 02:14:15,291
<span style="style.default_1">If I am not close to you</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Then who will be?</span>

1714
02:14:15,666 --> 02:14:20,916
<span style="style.default_1">My soul will yearn,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">My heart will too weep</span>

1715
02:14:21,083 --> 02:14:26,666
<span style="style.default_1">If I am not close to you</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Then who will be?</span>

1716
02:14:27,041 --> 02:14:32,416
<span style="style.default_1">My soul will yearn,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">My heart will too weep</span>

1717
02:14:32,708 --> 02:14:36,083
<span style="style.default_1">My heart will too weep</span>
