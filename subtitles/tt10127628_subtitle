00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:14,853
JAKKANNA

2
00:01:16,525 --> 00:01:20,423
Dear children,
today, I'll tell you a story.

3
00:01:21,088 --> 00:01:22,568
Once upon a time, there was a forest.

4
00:01:22,914 --> 00:01:24,852
That's a big tree in that forest.

5
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:26,439
There is a pigeon on the tree.

6
00:01:26,591 --> 00:01:29,074
There was an ant in the anthill.

7
00:01:29,607 --> 00:01:31,456
One day, it rained very heavily.

8
00:01:32,004 --> 00:01:34,953
The ant was washing away by the rainwater.

9
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:38,958
But the pigeon was happily
playing in the rain.

10
00:01:39,108 --> 00:01:42,189
Meanwhile, a leaf fell down in
the water when it's wing brushed it.

11
00:01:42,647 --> 00:01:46,214
Immediately, the ant climbed
on the leaf and saved its life.

12
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,493
After it stopped raining,
the ant went to that pigeon and said that,

13
00:01:51,002 --> 00:01:55,079
you saved my life and I'm
ready to do anything for you.

14
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:56,698
Then that pigeon laughed and said,

15
00:01:56,898 --> 00:02:00,008
"You can walk only on
the ground but I can fly."

16
00:02:00,477 --> 00:02:02,936
"You are a tiny creature,
how can you help me?"

17
00:02:03,515 --> 00:02:07,484
Later on one day,
a hunter aimed the bow at the pigeon.

18
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,141
Meanwhile, the ant saw the hunter,
went quickly and bit his leg hard.

19
00:02:13,354 --> 00:02:15,834
The bow missed its goal
and the pigeon flew away.

20
00:02:16,034 --> 00:02:19,612
When an ant did so much in
return as gratitude for help,

21
00:02:19,912 --> 00:02:22,614
what should we do as human beings?

22
00:02:24,724 --> 00:02:26,684
For the people who help
us when we are in trouble,

23
00:02:27,311 --> 00:02:32,029
No matter how much we do for them as
gratitude, we'll be still indebted to them.

24
00:02:32,618 --> 00:02:37,638
Because the one who considers our
trouble as theirs isn't a human but God.

25
00:02:45,085 --> 00:02:48,174
Hey Ganesh! How did you fell?
Get up... Get up...

26
00:02:48,374 --> 00:02:50,399
Come here and sit down.

27
00:02:50,544 --> 00:02:54,331
- It will heal.
- Oh God!

28
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,261
Let's go.

29
00:02:59,455 --> 00:03:01,092
Why are you carrying my bag?

30
00:03:01,194 --> 00:03:04,175
You bandaged me when I was wounded.
Now don't worry about yourself.

31
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:05,541
I'll look after you.

32
00:03:05,684 --> 00:03:06,749
What are you staring at?

33
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:09,452
From today, I'm the ant and
you are the pigeon. Let's go.

34
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,307
Do you want the ice cream?

35
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:20,584
- Yes.
- Come then.

36
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:23,600
Give him one more.
Give two more.

37
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:24,962
It's enough.

38
00:03:25,478 --> 00:03:27,876
You bandaged me when I wounded.
Have it.

39
00:03:27,976 --> 00:03:29,856
How many are there in the box?
Give me two more.

40
00:03:30,392 --> 00:03:31,432
Give me all that you have.

41
00:03:31,562 --> 00:03:33,176
There are many in the
box it seems. Eat them.

42
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,709
- It's enough, I don't want anymore.
- Give him two more.

43
00:03:37,828 --> 00:03:41,385
Hey Seenu! Get up.
It's melting, take it.

44
00:03:41,485 --> 00:03:43,376
This is our Ganesh's character.

45
00:03:43,476 --> 00:03:45,361
There will be no limits
if he is committed.

46
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:51,090
This idiot showers affection
on them who helps him.

47
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,473
Meanwhile,
his character has also grown with his age.

48
00:03:54,673 --> 00:03:55,867
Well, watch his story.

49
00:04:18,484 --> 00:04:19,487
"Hey... Hey..."

50
00:04:20,497 --> 00:04:21,742
"Oh."

51
00:04:23,031 --> 00:04:24,031
"Hey... Hey..."

52
00:04:25,209 --> 00:04:26,209
"Hey... Hey..."

53
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,433
"Oh."

54
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:32,490
"Dhimmathirige
song from the film Srimanthudu."

55
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,590
Dear... Dear...

56
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,961
"Dhimmathirige
song from the film Srimanthudu."

57
00:04:39,325 --> 00:04:40,909
Dear, you wallet fell down.

58
00:04:44,922 --> 00:04:47,105
Why are you staring like that?
Isn't it yours?

59
00:04:47,397 --> 00:04:48,118
It's mine.

60
00:04:48,218 --> 00:04:49,218
Then...

61
00:04:51,162 --> 00:04:53,596
Though I returned his wallet, he
didn't give me money. Great person.

62
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:58,132
"Dhimmathirige
song from the film Srimanthudu."

63
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:03,922
"Tauba Tauba song
from the film Sardar Gabbar Singh."

64
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:08,631
"Tauba Tauba song
from the film Sardar Gabbar Singh."

65
00:05:09,592 --> 00:05:12,416
Alludu Seenu, every scene will
be a super hit if you arrive.

66
00:05:12,501 --> 00:05:13,501
I came.

67
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:15,335
Sir, why did you come again?

68
00:05:15,804 --> 00:05:19,155
You should follow any figure in your age
but why are you following this beggar?

69
00:05:19,355 --> 00:05:21,711
I've seen the people who steal the wallets
but you are the only one who returned it.

70
00:05:21,735 --> 00:05:23,523
- I liked you.
- Will you give me money then?

71
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:24,735
No, no. I will do justice.

72
00:05:25,573 --> 00:05:26,879
He should transform in that way.

73
00:05:27,457 --> 00:05:28,494
This is modern cutting.

74
00:05:28,794 --> 00:05:31,442
Dear, no one will give me a
penny if I look like this.

75
00:05:31,542 --> 00:05:33,097
Yes. They will pay you in dollars.

76
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:35,495
You are looking awesome.

77
00:05:35,771 --> 00:05:38,711
Dear, what is the use of a t-shirt
when I cannot even afford tea?

78
00:05:39,282 --> 00:05:41,675
Your range will change
with this change.

79
00:05:43,765 --> 00:05:45,994
Brother,
sing that song which you just sang it.

80
00:05:46,306 --> 00:05:47,972
I cannot sing unless I get a coin.

81
00:05:48,776 --> 00:05:49,776
Start.

82
00:05:49,943 --> 00:05:55,014
"Cinema chupista mama
song from the film Race Gurram."

83
00:05:55,890 --> 00:06:01,353
"Cinema chupista mama
song from the film Race Gurram."

84
00:06:01,453 --> 00:06:06,177
"Cinema chupista mama
song from the film Race Gurram."

85
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:09,271
Hello.

86
00:06:16,718 --> 00:06:18,612
Bro, I thought I'll get change if I sing,

87
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:20,792
but I didn't think that
my life will be changed.

88
00:06:21,187 --> 00:06:22,491
What did I do to you, bro?

89
00:06:23,442 --> 00:06:25,746
You returned my wallet
which has fallen down.

90
00:06:26,112 --> 00:06:28,906
I cultivate with the lives
of the people who help me.

91
00:06:29,006 --> 00:06:30,006
Bro, what is you name?

92
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,016
My name is Ganesh and
the nickname is Jakkanna.

93
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:43,921
"He is the helper to the help."

94
00:06:44,121 --> 00:06:46,092
"He is the symbol of the help."

95
00:06:46,182 --> 00:06:50,140
"He'll come in seconds if you
pronounce the spelling of help."

96
00:06:50,581 --> 00:06:52,793
"Help him and see."

97
00:06:53,073 --> 00:06:54,987
"He will look after your life."

98
00:06:55,076 --> 00:06:59,015
"He will stand for no matter if
it is love or any other risk."

99
00:07:11,781 --> 00:07:12,461
"Shake it down."

100
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:16,839
"Brother, you need the help of
your parents for your birth."

101
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:21,176
"Brother, you need the help of
four friends on your death day."

102
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:25,627
"Brother, you need the help of
your parents for your birth."

103
00:07:25,827 --> 00:07:30,198
"Brother, you need the help of
four friends on your death day."

104
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:34,563
"Brother, we need some kind of
help regularly in our lives."

105
00:07:35,063 --> 00:07:37,733
"Brother, we need help."

106
00:07:39,444 --> 00:07:43,385
"We aren't sure if 100
comes on our request."

107
00:07:43,841 --> 00:07:47,777
"He will come if say 'Oh my friend."

108
00:07:48,272 --> 00:07:52,302
"We aren't sure if 108
comes on our request."

109
00:07:52,701 --> 00:07:57,178
"He will come if say 'Oh my friend."

110
00:07:57,316 --> 00:07:58,829
"He is the friend for life."

111
00:08:08,635 --> 00:08:10,583
"He has born for me."

112
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,463
"He is the role model for the friendship."

113
00:08:19,468 --> 00:08:21,507
"Friendship attracts."

114
00:08:23,761 --> 00:08:27,555
"Friendship is love."

115
00:08:28,651 --> 00:08:32,750
"Smiling at the one who
got tears in their eyes"

116
00:08:32,826 --> 00:08:36,101
"is the help done with our lips."

117
00:08:37,465 --> 00:08:39,417
"When they face troubles."

118
00:08:39,673 --> 00:08:44,676
"The help given by
heart is to give courage."

119
00:08:46,066 --> 00:08:49,926
"A small help and a small smile
is the meaning of a human."

120
00:08:50,603 --> 00:08:54,428
"Selfishness and battle
inside you is meaningless."

121
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,389
"Follow this principle."

122
00:08:59,551 --> 00:09:03,374
"We aren't sure if 100
comes on our request."

123
00:09:03,897 --> 00:09:07,815
"He will come if say 'Oh my friend."

124
00:09:08,313 --> 00:09:12,312
"We aren't sure if 108
comes on our request."

125
00:09:12,743 --> 00:09:16,873
"He will come if say 'Oh my friend."

126
00:09:17,314 --> 00:09:18,966
"He is the friend for life."

127
00:09:21,054 --> 00:09:22,894
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, sir.

128
00:09:23,435 --> 00:09:24,435
Please sit down.

129
00:09:25,914 --> 00:09:28,490
Today your police training
is going to complete.

130
00:09:28,703 --> 00:09:32,471
I'm going to introduce you an interesting
character as a matter of the last class.

131
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,671
His name is Bairagi.

132
00:09:36,626 --> 00:09:38,104
He is the king of Vizag.

133
00:09:40,785 --> 00:09:41,865
He can't be seen by anyone.

134
00:09:42,387 --> 00:09:43,752
No one knows how he will be.

135
00:09:47,344 --> 00:09:49,019
His name is Bhavani alias Dega.

136
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:51,160
He was a notorious thug of
Vizag at a point of time.

137
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,577
That Bairagi became a king
by killing him 15 years ago.

138
00:09:55,122 --> 00:09:58,130
So, we don't know how and
why did he kill him.

139
00:09:58,471 --> 00:09:59,945
We only know where he killed him.

140
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:18,497
Brother, someone slaughtered our guy.

141
00:10:31,717 --> 00:10:32,717
Hey!

142
00:10:35,746 --> 00:10:36,416
Who is he?

143
00:10:36,616 --> 00:10:37,616
Hey!

144
00:10:40,114 --> 00:10:41,114
Who is that?

145
00:10:43,882 --> 00:10:46,623
My name is Dega. If you are daring
enough, come in front of me.

146
00:10:50,142 --> 00:10:52,169
Bairagi, let's go... Bairagi, let's go...

147
00:11:01,346 --> 00:11:05,815
Hey! Are you the Bairagi
who is working in my shop?

148
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:08,208
I cannot believe.

149
00:11:09,076 --> 00:11:11,774
Brother... Brother... Brother...

150
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:19,481
Will I become like him after I grow up?

151
00:11:24,586 --> 00:11:27,638
You'll grow up but you
will not become like him.

152
00:11:44,718 --> 00:11:46,789
I became greater than him.

153
00:11:50,562 --> 00:11:55,818
I thought you were mad when you said
that you would become like Dega.

154
00:11:57,306 --> 00:11:59,707
But, you've been observing
him all these days,

155
00:12:00,272 --> 00:12:02,640
and killed him by wearing a police uniform

156
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:05,984
so that the police and his
henchmen won't trace you,

157
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:07,330
You are very great.

158
00:12:07,884 --> 00:12:08,884
Hey!

159
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:14,361
From today, you are the King of Vizag.

160
00:12:16,095 --> 00:12:18,031
Give respect to the King.

161
00:12:19,141 --> 00:12:22,266
The world doesn't know me till yesterday.

162
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:27,451
From today, the world shouldn't
know how I'll be except my name.

163
00:12:27,551 --> 00:12:28,213
Why?

164
00:12:28,413 --> 00:12:31,911
Just like I killed him by
peering for so many days,

165
00:12:32,781 --> 00:12:35,341
I won't give a chance to kill me.

166
00:12:35,946 --> 00:12:37,824
Be it Bairagi or God,

167
00:12:37,984 --> 00:12:41,224
people would be obedient and living in
fear of them only till they stay invisible.

168
00:12:42,686 --> 00:12:45,283
No one can see you from this moment.

169
00:12:46,402 --> 00:12:48,450
Only your name can be heard.

170
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:51,229
I'll take care.

171
00:12:53,214 --> 00:12:57,597
On the very next day of the murder,
Bairagi posted these in the entire Vizag.

172
00:12:57,797 --> 00:13:00,589
Only by these,
we learnt that his name is Bairagi.

173
00:13:02,499 --> 00:13:04,388
You name is on paper for the first time.

174
00:13:04,853 --> 00:13:08,842
From today, you'll hear to such
news everyday and everywhere.

175
00:13:09,117 --> 00:13:10,797
Aakashavani, Vishakapatanam center.

176
00:13:10,997 --> 00:13:14,561
Bairagi killed Ex-MP who was
opposing him in a contract.

177
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:17,020
Rowdy gangs are expanding in the city.

178
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,720
There is no end to Bairagi's atrocities.

179
00:13:18,856 --> 00:13:23,097
Inconspicuous Bairagi, took the
custody of entire Vizag city.

180
00:13:23,349 --> 00:13:27,220
At present, no one knows where
is Bairagi and what is he doing.

181
00:13:30,492 --> 00:13:33,672
We don't know who makes the deal
and who stays with him.

182
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:39,055
We don't even know about how he
handles such a complex network.

183
00:13:41,414 --> 00:13:44,622
Just like our department ignored
many things in our country,

184
00:13:45,465 --> 00:13:48,670
it ignored Bairagi too
as it cannot find him.

185
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:51,761
Sir, I wanted to see him once as you
are explaining too much about him.

186
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:53,123
Oh, please don't try it.

187
00:13:53,223 --> 00:13:58,363
Because no one will survive
who saw Bairagi.

188
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:10,213
Hello dad.

189
00:14:10,386 --> 00:14:16,071
You went to Vizag after 15 years.
Did you start the house renovation or not?

190
00:14:16,338 --> 00:14:18,798
I forgot as I was busy.

191
00:14:19,144 --> 00:14:20,926
I know what is making you busy.

192
00:14:21,385 --> 00:14:25,714
You'll not succeed unless you
forget the H, E, I, P alphabets.

193
00:14:25,905 --> 00:14:26,905
Did you get it?

194
00:14:35,744 --> 00:14:37,535
Hello... Hello...

195
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:41,679
Did you hear?

196
00:14:42,135 --> 00:14:44,730
Why isn't he speaking
despite being on call?

197
00:14:46,432 --> 00:14:47,432
Look at this.

198
00:14:50,105 --> 00:14:53,736
At last the wifi of my
life connected me at Vizag.

199
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,791
My life will be awesome if
this wifi becomes my wife.

200
00:15:00,991 --> 00:15:03,630
- It will be very good.
- Mom, that is...

201
00:15:04,307 --> 00:15:07,946
Hey! We are on call but seems
like you are wooing a girl.

202
00:15:08,306 --> 00:15:11,306
Dad, I cannot hear you properly. Signals
are very weak. I'll call you later.

203
00:15:11,701 --> 00:15:15,522
Our son has overcome the helpline
and now he is dealing with love.

204
00:15:15,921 --> 00:15:19,356
So, we cannot hear our
parents when we find a girl.

205
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:31,126
The signal might miss
due to this rain.

206
00:15:44,662 --> 00:15:47,699
The way to my mother-in-law's
home is very wide.

207
00:15:52,264 --> 00:15:53,960
- Dad, I'm going out.
- Okay dear.

208
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,719
- Are you going to the computer class?
- I'm going to attend karate classes.

209
00:15:56,743 --> 00:16:00,451
You are a girl. Instead of learning how
to cook by seeing the cooking programs,

210
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,118
why are you learning mashalads?

211
00:16:02,567 --> 00:16:03,782
It's been a habit

212
00:16:04,038 --> 00:16:07,574
for the society to demean women
just like a tiger demeans deer.

213
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,958
You are as cute as a Laddu.

214
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,199
- You...
- Hey!

215
00:16:28,329 --> 00:16:31,129
Do you think that it is easy to hit
me as you hit the ritualistic bell?

216
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:33,861
Do you feel that girls cannot hit you?

217
00:16:34,147 --> 00:16:36,729
Hen and women both are
equal in my perspective.

218
00:16:37,105 --> 00:16:39,826
A woman should cook
and hen should be cooked.

219
00:16:39,926 --> 00:16:40,926
What do you say?

220
00:16:40,969 --> 00:16:45,412
Exactly in the next month, at
the same time and same place,

221
00:16:46,236 --> 00:16:47,236
I'll hit you.

222
00:16:47,783 --> 00:16:51,351
I'm learning karate to hit him.

223
00:16:51,451 --> 00:16:54,361
Dear, she is not listening to me.

224
00:16:54,461 --> 00:16:55,734
Did you listen to me?

225
00:16:57,319 --> 00:16:58,387
Do what you like.

226
00:17:02,652 --> 00:17:03,654
You are very...

227
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:05,792
Why isn't she coming yet?

228
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:07,196
Good morning, Ganesh.

229
00:17:08,243 --> 00:17:10,132
Oh God!
How did she get to know about my name?

230
00:17:10,332 --> 00:17:12,059
Ganesh, I know everything.

231
00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:17,161
You are staring at me every
minute like a CCTV, right?

232
00:17:17,361 --> 00:17:20,453
Oh God!
She learnt that I was watching her.

233
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:24,259
Ganesh, why do you love me so much?

234
00:17:25,499 --> 00:17:28,173
There won't be any logic for love.

235
00:17:28,567 --> 00:17:30,221
I love you so much, Ganesh.

236
00:17:31,349 --> 00:17:35,206
What is this? She accepted my love so
easily just like a facebook request.

237
00:17:35,896 --> 00:17:37,736
Hey Ganesh,
your luck started to work.

238
00:17:40,491 --> 00:17:41,491
Bye Ganesh.

239
00:17:41,734 --> 00:17:44,517
Was she talking to that Ganesh till now?

240
00:17:44,817 --> 00:17:48,200
Huh! It's actually bad
luck that started for me.

241
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,300
She is coming.

242
00:17:53,176 --> 00:17:55,096
Men can become husbands only
when they work hard.

243
00:17:58,002 --> 00:17:58,835
- Okay.
- Thank you.

244
00:17:58,953 --> 00:17:59,953
You can go inside.

245
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:02,910
I'm coming.

246
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,873
- Do you have an Id?
- I have voter Id too.

247
00:18:06,267 --> 00:18:08,637
Fighting is taking place inside
but not voting.

248
00:18:09,238 --> 00:18:13,127
Oh God!
Everyone is being so sarcastic.

249
00:18:14,488 --> 00:18:15,488
Get going man.

250
00:18:15,651 --> 00:18:17,131
Brother, I'll just see and come back.

251
00:18:20,614 --> 00:18:22,063
Hey Seenu!

252
00:18:22,263 --> 00:18:24,952
You bandaged me
when I wounded. Have it.

253
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,635
Oh God! Why did Ganesh come again?

254
00:18:27,777 --> 00:18:28,873
What an acting!

255
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:30,795
I'll finish you, come.

256
00:18:31,803 --> 00:18:33,552
Thank God!

257
00:18:33,685 --> 00:18:35,450
- If he sees me, I'll be ruined.
- Come.

258
00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:42,009
When did you arrive from Badrachalam?

259
00:18:42,423 --> 00:18:44,168
I didn't come to receive
you since I saw your message.

260
00:18:44,192 --> 00:18:45,610
Why are you hiding after seeing me?

261
00:18:46,066 --> 00:18:48,233
I wasn't hiding but I was
searching for a one rupee coin.

262
00:18:48,257 --> 00:18:50,750
Stop using cheap tricks.
What are you doing here?

263
00:18:51,272 --> 00:18:53,912
- I'm working as a peon here.
- Is it? Then why didn't you tell me?

264
00:18:54,186 --> 00:18:58,023
I have tied a bandage for your
injury during your childhood,

265
00:18:58,411 --> 00:19:01,169
and you've been chasing me even
now in the name of helping me.

266
00:19:01,356 --> 00:19:04,162
That's why I'm working here
where even Google can't find me.

267
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,076
- This time I haven't come for you.
- Then?

268
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,757
The girl who just went inside.

269
00:19:08,156 --> 00:19:09,156
Thank God!

270
00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:11,534
By the way,
what help did that girl do?

271
00:19:11,558 --> 00:19:12,873
No, she didn't help me.

272
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,795
For the first time in my life,

273
00:19:15,069 --> 00:19:18,393
I want change her life
though she didn't help me.

274
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:23,196
I couldn't move my head since I saw her.

275
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,448
I think your neck got stuck.

276
00:19:24,769 --> 00:19:26,859
Negative fellow.
Actually my heart got stuck.

277
00:19:27,304 --> 00:19:30,384
You got me like a water packet
in a desert. You should help me.

278
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:34,430
Help you again? Helping you is
like making friends with fevicol.

279
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,364
You will get sticked to life.
I cannot do it.

280
00:19:36,388 --> 00:19:38,424
Alright, don't help me.
Tell me how to get inside.

281
00:19:38,567 --> 00:19:41,017
This is an institute but not a
park for a random guy to get in.

282
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:42,241
Then I will join as a student.

283
00:19:42,574 --> 00:19:44,116
We don't have admissions
for another six months.

284
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,260
Then I will join as a coach.

285
00:19:45,741 --> 00:19:46,979
Do you know that they need five
years of experience for that?

286
00:19:47,003 --> 00:19:48,003
I will join as MD.

287
00:19:48,212 --> 00:19:50,591
- He is the one who recruits you.
- Then I'll join as a clerk.

288
00:19:50,615 --> 00:19:51,615
Then what should I do?

289
00:19:51,855 --> 00:19:54,121
- Oh God!
- You should go to the hospital and come.

290
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,246
You tied bandages to my entire body for
tying you a bandage in your childhood.

291
00:19:58,472 --> 00:20:01,466
- At last, my life became full of bandages.
- Your bandage is a bond for our love.

292
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:03,413
Continue in this chair for few days.
It will be new to you.

293
00:20:03,437 --> 00:20:04,996
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

294
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,574
You are just Seenu till yesterday.
But now, you are Bandage Srinu.

295
00:20:10,301 --> 00:20:10,962
Oh God!

296
00:20:11,198 --> 00:20:13,192
Who is he?
Seems like Kingkong new teaser.

297
00:20:15,406 --> 00:20:18,046
He is the in charge of this
institute and office manager.

298
00:20:18,146 --> 00:20:20,303
You can stay here only if you manage him.

299
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:22,911
Did this clerk left to Ooty when
I've asked him to bring tea.

300
00:20:24,485 --> 00:20:27,237
- What's wrong with him?
- Greetings. Ouch!

301
00:20:27,313 --> 00:20:29,033
Why have you become
like a dummy of a mummy?

302
00:20:29,346 --> 00:20:29,855
Tell him.

303
00:20:30,283 --> 00:20:32,534
Ouch! As I needed a fast service,
I boarded a service auto-rickshaw.

304
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:34,254
I got to know that it's service is over
after I boarded it.

305
00:20:34,278 --> 00:20:36,397
The driver drove the vehicle
on the divider instead of road.

306
00:20:36,421 --> 00:20:37,423
What happened next?

307
00:20:37,523 --> 00:20:38,956
My body got filled with bandages.

308
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:40,484
That means you don't work anymore.

309
00:20:40,508 --> 00:20:41,758
- Obviously.
- Then who will do this work?

310
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:42,858
- That is...
- I will do it.

311
00:20:42,882 --> 00:20:43,882
Who are you?

312
00:20:43,915 --> 00:20:46,403
I'm his friend and my name is
Ganesh just like Mahesh and Prabhas.

313
00:20:46,427 --> 00:20:48,027
- Oh!
- Poor them! They'll have bad time.

314
00:20:48,337 --> 00:20:50,359
You don't seem like an office boy
instead, you seem like a cowboy.

315
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:54,703
I'm not aware of Cow but when I was born,
the doctor told me that I'm a boy.

316
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:57,135
You are too sarcastic
but do you work well?

317
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,310
I'll work to an extent where
you appreciate me.

318
00:21:00,589 --> 00:21:01,749
My friend does things overly.

319
00:21:02,611 --> 00:21:04,734
No, I'm like a Range Rover.

320
00:21:04,937 --> 00:21:06,168
Why should you do his work?

321
00:21:06,251 --> 00:21:07,762
Because we cannot leave our bike
since it doesn't have petrol,

322
00:21:07,786 --> 00:21:09,819
similarly we cannot leave our friend
as he met with an accident.

323
00:21:09,843 --> 00:21:11,543
I've seen friends who are of no use,

324
00:21:11,743 --> 00:21:14,823
but you are the only one who is doing
useful work for the sake of your friend.

325
00:21:15,046 --> 00:21:15,797
Thank you.

326
00:21:15,935 --> 00:21:19,121
- Your character is very clean.
- Your office will also be very clean.

327
00:21:19,415 --> 00:21:20,522
- Carry on then.
- I did.

328
00:21:21,403 --> 00:21:22,403
Where is she?

329
00:21:22,478 --> 00:21:24,030
Today is a very important class.

330
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:25,206
- We shouldn't miss at all.
- Let's go.

331
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:26,878
- Let's go.
- Yes, okay.

332
00:21:48,186 --> 00:21:50,798
How can this tiny little guy stop a lorry?

333
00:21:51,111 --> 00:21:52,161
We should blame the viewers!

334
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:54,030
Hey!
You aren't aware of the master.

335
00:21:54,323 --> 00:21:56,186
Do you know that he has
recently stopped a goods train?

336
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:58,491
Forget about goods train,
I can stop a flight in graphics.

337
00:21:59,034 --> 00:22:02,203
- Do you mean it's a graphics?
- I'm fixed that it's a graphics.

338
00:22:02,473 --> 00:22:05,012
Would he arrive in a simple
manner? Or does his entry have a CG?

339
00:22:09,686 --> 00:22:14,230
Why is he like this?

340
00:22:16,174 --> 00:22:18,504
- Look at him.
- He looks like a tea supplier.

341
00:22:21,755 --> 00:22:26,198
Sir, how did you move that
huge lorry with your left hand?

342
00:22:26,292 --> 00:22:27,945
Oh God!

343
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:33,409
Her mentality is clubbed
with humanity and innocence.

344
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,777
This girl is excited by
knowing about this small thing.

345
00:22:37,012 --> 00:22:39,852
When I was in China, I punched the
Great wall of China and it collapsed.

346
00:22:40,482 --> 00:22:41,828
Later they've arranged my statue there...

347
00:22:41,852 --> 00:22:43,212
- And build the wall again.
- Yeah.

348
00:22:43,469 --> 00:22:45,992
Superman feels ashamed if he sees you.

349
00:22:46,534 --> 00:22:48,004
And the Batman would be scared.

350
00:22:48,312 --> 00:22:49,533
Common man will die.

351
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:53,686
Dear, you should feel a few feelings
but you shouldn't express them.

352
00:22:53,733 --> 00:22:57,902
Sir, I have seen your performance
in DVD but not on the dais.

353
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:02,498
I wanted to see it live at
least once in my lifetime.

354
00:23:03,617 --> 00:23:05,130
- In live?
- Sir, should perform...

355
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:08,324
Sir, should perform...
Sir, should perform...

356
00:23:08,662 --> 00:23:10,971
- Yes.
- He should know to perform.

357
00:23:11,271 --> 00:23:13,791
- You don't know anything.
- Even they aren't aware of anything.

358
00:23:14,463 --> 00:23:15,783
Since none of them know anything,

359
00:23:15,902 --> 00:23:18,078
whatever we exhibit is kung
fu, karate and taekwondo.

360
00:23:18,278 --> 00:23:19,278
- Marlon Brando.
- Yes.

361
00:23:22,031 --> 00:23:26,474
He is cheating everyone without being
skilled. I'll give him a holiday today.

362
00:23:26,619 --> 00:23:29,301
Come litle forward.

363
00:23:29,501 --> 00:23:31,804
Perfect.

364
00:23:32,475 --> 00:23:36,952
Good fielding.

365
00:23:37,152 --> 00:23:40,216
- Who has done this to me?
- He is the new clerk, sir.

366
00:23:40,623 --> 00:23:43,344
Hey!
Have you come here to clean or to hit him?

367
00:23:43,552 --> 00:23:47,897
Why are you talking to him after this?
Send him out immediately.

368
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:50,983
Sir, it's hard to get a clerk immediately.

369
00:23:51,036 --> 00:23:52,648
Sir, do you also feel pain?

370
00:23:52,796 --> 00:23:56,340
Forget about me. Even Kanal Kannan
can feel the pain if it is hit properly.

371
00:23:56,362 --> 00:23:57,842
Don't you know how to hold the stick?

372
00:23:58,204 --> 00:24:01,835
I know but I didn't know that he
could correctly land on the stick.

373
00:24:02,095 --> 00:24:05,394
Stop your discussions and
tell him the institute rules.

374
00:24:05,494 --> 00:24:06,218
- Alright sir.
- Sir...

375
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,984
- what about the class then?
- Where did keep his attention?

376
00:24:08,008 --> 00:24:10,518
I'm not feeling good.
The class got cancelled.

377
00:24:11,065 --> 00:24:13,652
But sir you said that you
would teach us the leg moment.

378
00:24:14,461 --> 00:24:16,178
There will be no moment until a week.

379
00:24:17,318 --> 00:24:18,318
Good morning sir.

380
00:24:20,925 --> 00:24:21,925
Nice meeting you.

381
00:24:22,144 --> 00:24:23,916
Hey mister! Do you have sense?

382
00:24:24,205 --> 00:24:25,910
I have even an idol of
Buddha in my home.

383
00:24:26,453 --> 00:24:28,719
What am I asking and
what are you saying?

384
00:24:29,008 --> 00:24:31,340
Aren't we both are
discussing about the Buddha?

385
00:24:31,594 --> 00:24:33,098
Why did you disturb the class?

386
00:24:33,287 --> 00:24:37,457
I remembered something when you class...
You are very classy girl.

387
00:24:37,557 --> 00:24:38,557
Hey!

388
00:24:39,192 --> 00:24:42,084
Aren't your expression meant what am
I speaking and what are you talking?

389
00:24:42,184 --> 00:24:44,051
We both are discussing
the class, aren't we?

390
00:24:44,226 --> 00:24:46,331
I don't know what to tell you.

391
00:24:46,358 --> 00:24:49,079
- Stupid, idiot, bloody scoundrel...
- I should divert her.

392
00:24:49,479 --> 00:24:50,479
In fact...

393
00:24:51,835 --> 00:24:55,758
Look Ganesh, you punish him
immediately, forgive him if he change,

394
00:24:56,282 --> 00:24:58,086
but recognize that I'm hurt.

395
00:24:58,685 --> 00:25:00,074
- Did you hear me?
- Yes.

396
00:25:00,274 --> 00:25:01,274
Shut up.

397
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:10,868
Hey! I'm the henchman of Bairagi,
Telangana settler.

398
00:25:12,006 --> 00:25:14,001
- How much is this packet?
- It's a ten rupees brother.

399
00:25:14,025 --> 00:25:15,642
- Give me ten rupees.
- Why?

400
00:25:15,742 --> 00:25:17,102
You damn! I'm the henchman of Bairagi.

401
00:25:17,126 --> 00:25:18,277
- Brother, I got it.
- You should pay me in return.

402
00:25:18,301 --> 00:25:19,611
- Did you get it?
- Here are the ten rupees.

403
00:25:19,635 --> 00:25:21,462
Sudarshan Reddy, did you got to the well?

404
00:25:21,576 --> 00:25:22,856
- Greetings brother.
- Greetings.

405
00:25:25,444 --> 00:25:28,595
Hey! How dare you to lit a
cigarette in front of me?

406
00:25:30,609 --> 00:25:31,649
Hey! Give me that lighter.

407
00:25:32,436 --> 00:25:35,903
Why the hell are you staring at me?
I'll pull those eyes you bloody fool!

408
00:25:36,273 --> 00:25:38,120
You freaking guy! Don't you know who am I?

409
00:25:40,178 --> 00:25:43,837
How dare you light the
fire in front of the Lion.

410
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:50,132
It's your cigarette and your smoke.
Have it.

411
00:25:52,728 --> 00:25:53,895
Hey! What are you looking at?

412
00:25:55,021 --> 00:25:58,430
You are posing as if there is
a sword in the silencer.

413
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:01,291
Are you thinking that I'll be frightened?
I'm the henchman of Bairagi.

414
00:26:04,059 --> 00:26:08,138
You got scared, right? Get lost! Are you
people watching the drama? Get going.

415
00:26:11,432 --> 00:26:14,757
- Have the red wine.
- Why do you always offer red wine?

416
00:26:15,093 --> 00:26:19,750
You offered me grape juice when
I was thirsty in my childhood.

417
00:26:20,517 --> 00:26:23,442
- What will happen after 20 years?
- It will decay.

418
00:26:23,733 --> 00:26:25,845
Yes, it will decay and become wine.

419
00:26:26,662 --> 00:26:31,075
Your face will shine if you drink it and
you will settle down with some girl.

420
00:26:31,652 --> 00:26:33,447
I'm clearing your debt in this way.

421
00:26:34,187 --> 00:26:36,554
This is not called as
clearing debt but it is disgusting.

422
00:26:37,606 --> 00:26:40,286
You are unable to distinguish between
what is right and what is not.

423
00:26:40,892 --> 00:26:42,233
Have some wine.
You will get to know.

424
00:26:42,257 --> 00:26:44,008
No, this is not wine but it's pain.

425
00:26:44,451 --> 00:26:45,995
Nice punch.

426
00:26:46,834 --> 00:26:50,530
Hey!
Isn't he looking like our manager?

427
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:53,709
Of course it's him. He is the only
fat person who wears that dress.

428
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,960
What is that?
Go and sit in your chair.

429
00:26:57,803 --> 00:26:59,500
He is looking like a pregnant king kong.

430
00:27:00,304 --> 00:27:01,304
Careful.

431
00:27:02,572 --> 00:27:05,065
- You were sitting here, aren't you?
- You boozed, aren't you?

432
00:27:05,265 --> 00:27:06,331
Oh God! Did he recognise?

433
00:27:06,473 --> 00:27:08,940
- He boozed.
- How can you booze being a clerk?

434
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,174
Is it? Is there any rule
that only managers should booze?

435
00:27:11,198 --> 00:27:13,838
Not just one rule but
there is a rules list here.

436
00:27:15,685 --> 00:27:18,200
Is this a list or an Everest?
It is so lengthy.

437
00:27:18,301 --> 00:27:19,898
- What?
- I'm talking to you.

438
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,907
Don't act smart.

439
00:27:22,325 --> 00:27:24,965
If you want to work in this kung
fu panda karate school,

440
00:27:25,008 --> 00:27:26,860
you should follow these rules strictly.

441
00:27:27,101 --> 00:27:27,525
Hold it.

442
00:27:27,993 --> 00:27:29,517
- Give that bottle to me.
- He saw it.

443
00:27:33,805 --> 00:27:38,031
Sir's life will bcome hell with this list

444
00:27:38,131 --> 00:27:40,022
and my darling becomes close to me.

445
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:51,811
You have seen my talent now.

446
00:27:51,908 --> 00:27:53,082
Come on, applause.

447
00:27:53,282 --> 00:27:56,814
Sir,
how did you break such a huge tree?

448
00:27:57,170 --> 00:28:00,595
She doesn't know the difference
between Dhoodh peda and cow dung?

449
00:28:00,795 --> 00:28:04,339
You are really great sir.
You are miniature Brad Pitt.

450
00:28:04,721 --> 00:28:08,531
There is a small change.
If he is a Brad Pitt then he is a bad fit.

451
00:28:08,736 --> 00:28:09,736
Shut up.

452
00:28:10,047 --> 00:28:13,693
Sir,
how did you break such a huge tree?

453
00:28:13,917 --> 00:28:16,697
- Everything is possible in karate.
- But this is kung fu.

454
00:28:16,958 --> 00:28:19,267
Karate, kung fu, taekwondo
and Marlon Brando.

455
00:28:19,367 --> 00:28:21,523
- But he is a film actor.
- Even he was my student.

456
00:28:21,623 --> 00:28:24,211
- Do you know mashalads?
- Do you know Geetha arts?

457
00:28:25,461 --> 00:28:27,022
Why did you come here?

458
00:28:27,222 --> 00:28:30,230
Because I have to give you juice at
11 am according to rule number 44.

459
00:28:30,615 --> 00:28:32,295
- Then give it to me.
- It is yet to be 11.

460
00:28:32,516 --> 00:28:34,415
Then why are you here
when it is not the time.

461
00:28:34,648 --> 00:28:36,301
Rules are to enact,
but not for arrival.

462
00:28:36,782 --> 00:28:39,624
Hey! What is your disturbance
while the class is going on?

463
00:28:39,724 --> 00:28:42,010
Let's leave him and start our work.
Come.

464
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:44,947
This isn't called as work
but it is called a workout.

465
00:28:45,247 --> 00:28:45,699
Oh God!

466
00:28:46,147 --> 00:28:49,272
Sir, can I also practise
breaking down the tree?

467
00:28:49,372 --> 00:28:51,672
No, no. It's enough if you
do kung fu salute for today.

468
00:28:52,907 --> 00:28:54,776
- Okay.
- Hey, it's not like that.

469
00:28:54,876 --> 00:28:57,870
This is the style of 36th
chamber of Shaolin temple.

470
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:58,907
- Yeah.
- It's 11'o clock now.

471
00:28:58,994 --> 00:28:59,994
What is it?

472
00:29:00,043 --> 00:29:02,136
You'll be affected with gastric
problem if you don't have juice on time.

473
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,093
He will leave if I drink.
Bring it here.

474
00:29:05,425 --> 00:29:09,330
According to your rule number 33, I should
maintain a minimum of three feet distance.

475
00:29:09,579 --> 00:29:11,459
You don't come. I'll only come to you...
I'll only come to you...

476
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:12,736
I'll open my mouth and you pour it.

477
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,903
Sir, no. You don't know the next rule.

478
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:18,469
Sir, you crossed the three
feet distance and came inside.

479
00:29:18,669 --> 00:29:21,246
That means I should shiver by seeing you.

480
00:29:21,423 --> 00:29:27,236
Oh God! I'm trembling.

481
00:29:29,492 --> 00:29:31,936
- Sir, what about the class then?
- It is cancelled.

482
00:29:32,102 --> 00:29:35,327
He should take head bath and plait
his hair. So, it will take some time.

483
00:29:35,903 --> 00:29:36,903
Is she angry?

484
00:29:37,936 --> 00:29:39,923
Everyone has gone. Tell me now.

485
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:42,193
You don't like the class
to take place, right?

486
00:29:42,441 --> 00:29:44,976
As I'm a mass candidate,
the classes won't get into my mind.

487
00:29:45,522 --> 00:29:47,332
- Do you have sense?
- I have a license too.

488
00:29:47,845 --> 00:29:50,715
Why are you talking about license
while I'm talking about sense?

489
00:29:51,001 --> 00:29:52,791
They don't give us license
if we don't have sense.

490
00:29:52,815 --> 00:29:53,815
Nonsense!

491
00:29:53,883 --> 00:29:55,883
Sense for my dad?
Yes, he has sense too.

492
00:29:56,805 --> 00:29:59,457
- Ganesh!
- Shh!

493
00:30:01,663 --> 00:30:03,375
I have hanged it, now you can.

494
00:30:08,148 --> 00:30:11,321
I am Trible Astrologist.
I oath on Hill Goddess.

495
00:30:12,021 --> 00:30:15,788
I can tell what was happened,
what is going on and what will happen.

496
00:30:19,574 --> 00:30:22,562
Sir, I can see fire in your face.

497
00:30:24,715 --> 00:30:26,930
You are the Titan
sitting amidst the tires.

498
00:30:27,341 --> 00:30:29,199
You are a king
holding wrench in your hand.

499
00:30:29,806 --> 00:30:32,419
But I don't know why you
are living secrectly in dark.

500
00:30:36,028 --> 00:30:37,514
I oath on Hill Goddess,

501
00:30:38,009 --> 00:30:40,376
Your future is going to be in danger sir.

502
00:30:40,582 --> 00:30:43,382
What man? You are talking much.
Shut your mouth and mind your business.

503
00:30:43,413 --> 00:30:45,453
Even I shut my mouth but
the Hill Goddess won't sir.

504
00:30:49,252 --> 00:30:53,094
Did you hear sir? Hill Goddess
is communicating with the Crow.

505
00:30:53,525 --> 00:30:56,857
Tell me Crow. Okay, okay.

506
00:30:57,401 --> 00:30:59,830
Your bad time has been
started it seems sir,

507
00:31:00,523 --> 00:31:03,799
Your life would turn many
different turns it seems.

508
00:31:05,089 --> 00:31:07,489
The one who is going to turn
has already on his way it seems.

509
00:31:16,205 --> 00:31:17,205
- Brother.

00:31:17,601 --> 00:31:19,081

511
00:31:20,777 --> 00:31:21,777

512
00:31:25,126 --> 00:31:27,290
Brother, where can I find Bairagi here?

513
00:31:28,521 --> 00:31:30,121
Who are you? Don't you want to be alive?

514
00:31:43,717 --> 00:31:44,717

00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,390

00:31:48,414 --> 00:31:50,775
Allipuram Galli Pailwaan, get lost.

517
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:52,079
I am Bairagi's person.

518
00:31:52,647 --> 00:31:53,812
Hello, what were you asking?

519
00:31:56,018 --> 00:31:58,491
Smoking is injurious to health.

520
00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:06,547
I'll kick you if anyone raise their voice,
I am Bairagi's person.

521
00:32:06,747 --> 00:32:07,448
- What you people are thinking?
- Greetings, brother.

522
00:32:07,648 --> 00:32:09,222
Hey, what is your problem? Who are you?

523
00:32:09,635 --> 00:32:10,786
I am your fan brother.

524
00:32:10,986 --> 00:32:12,175
You are my fan?

525
00:32:12,375 --> 00:32:14,175
Would Samantha and
Sunny Leonie only has fans?

526
00:32:14,267 --> 00:32:15,611
Do you think Bairagi's people don't have?

527
00:32:15,635 --> 00:32:17,046
It's your affection buddy.

528
00:32:17,246 --> 00:32:19,632
- What do you need?
- I need you photo in my cell.

529
00:32:19,832 --> 00:32:22,648
Er... Give me a minute buddy,
I will get ready and come. Okay?

530
00:32:23,448 --> 00:32:25,110
Now take my photo buddy it's fancy number.

531
00:32:25,134 --> 00:32:27,373
I don't need the photo of jail brother.

532
00:32:27,762 --> 00:32:29,142
- Then?
- I need photo in my cell phone.

533
00:32:29,166 --> 00:32:32,249
Er... Don't mind buddy, I got
habituated from my childhood.

534
00:32:32,499 --> 00:32:33,027
Catch it man.

535
00:32:33,311 --> 00:32:35,648
Actually, I am competing as a ward member.

536
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:37,040
My symbol is bowl brother.

537
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,000
- Is it?
- If you take a photo sitting in it,

538
00:32:39,045 --> 00:32:40,964
then my symbol would be
remembered well in the heart of people

539
00:32:40,988 --> 00:32:43,755
and they will vote me like ballot box
would breaka and I will win brother.

540
00:32:43,779 --> 00:32:45,023
The Vessel got beauty because of you.

541
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:47,572
Hey, buddy! How is this pose?
It would be enough right?

542
00:32:47,772 --> 00:32:48,972
It wouldn't be enough brother.

543
00:32:49,025 --> 00:32:49,834
Then take like this.

544
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:52,034
If you call Bairagi and
make him stand for a photo,

545
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:54,022
I would get few more votes brother,
call him.

546
00:32:54,095 --> 00:32:56,184
Do you think Bairagi is a auto
that he would come as you call him?

547
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:57,829
He will come
automatically brother.

548
00:32:59,642 --> 00:33:01,094
Hey, why did you put fire?

549
00:33:02,172 --> 00:33:03,172
Hey, you stop it!

550
00:33:03,357 --> 00:33:05,429
If you want to cook food
you have to fire right?

551
00:33:05,629 --> 00:33:06,629
Yes.

552
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:09,959
Look, if you delay for ten minutes, you
will become grill chicken in this vessel.

553
00:33:10,104 --> 00:33:12,402
Do you think I am a Hen? I am Rowdy.

554
00:33:12,602 --> 00:33:14,795
Cool brother, look how cool I am.

555
00:33:14,995 --> 00:33:17,211
Did you made me sit on
the chair to be cool?

556
00:33:17,864 --> 00:33:19,050
You made me sit on fire.

557
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:22,263
Even you are going to burn
but you aren't making any call.

558
00:33:23,063 --> 00:33:25,563
He might kill me here if
I wouldn't call anyone.

559
00:33:30,231 --> 00:33:32,634
- Hello?
- Hey, you Buffalo face fellow.

560
00:33:32,834 --> 00:33:35,354
- You waste fellow, where are you?
- Hey! Who are you?

561
00:33:35,643 --> 00:33:37,189
Hey, you have born from
a Bull and Forester bison,

562
00:33:37,213 --> 00:33:38,213
when they got matted.

563
00:33:38,375 --> 00:33:40,175
I would throw sand in
your Buffalo face mouth.

564
00:33:40,489 --> 00:33:42,510
You don't when is your head
and where is your stomach.

565
00:33:42,534 --> 00:33:44,007
You look like a Pig.

566
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:46,030
- Who are you?
- Give the phone to brother.

567
00:33:46,262 --> 00:33:47,382
Now, who is the brother man?

568
00:33:47,576 --> 00:33:49,434
Greetings brother.

569
00:33:49,634 --> 00:33:51,590
Hey, you act like husband
of Aparichitudu's mother.

570
00:33:51,614 --> 00:33:53,648
Why you are changing
your tone like a ringtone?

571
00:33:53,848 --> 00:33:57,010
Nothing brother,
one of our guy is waiting to see you.

572
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:58,603
Where are you man? Where are you?

573
00:33:58,847 --> 00:34:00,407
In the street beside the Poorna Market.

574
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,546
Look, buddy brother is sending his guys,

575
00:34:04,746 --> 00:34:06,205
- Oh!
- I will bow to you don't mind.

576
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:08,073
Half of my legs are burnt till now,

577
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:09,928
please leave me.

578
00:34:10,128 --> 00:34:12,248
I am begging you please stop it,
can't you understand?

579
00:34:12,403 --> 00:34:13,403
Ah!

580
00:34:16,125 --> 00:34:16,769
Brother has sent these
guys because he is busy.

581
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:19,685
I think brother is busy so
he has sent these lazy guys.

582
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:22,219
- Come on guys let's move.
- Hello!

583
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,840
We aren't going to watch film,
we are going to meet brother.

584
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,425
We have some rules.
Hey, give me that mask.

585
00:34:29,264 --> 00:34:32,248
- Oh-ho!
- Let's move.

586
00:34:32,448 --> 00:34:33,448
You stay there.

587
00:34:34,392 --> 00:34:37,141
Oh God!
Did the phone call gone to brother.

588
00:34:37,427 --> 00:34:38,427
Let me try once more.

589
00:34:41,209 --> 00:34:42,009
- Ah!
- Oh yeah!

590
00:34:42,209 --> 00:34:43,801
I called to brother but
call has connected to Buffalo.

591
00:34:43,825 --> 00:34:44,960
Greetings, sir.

592
00:34:45,696 --> 00:34:46,823
- You got the call?
- Hey...

593
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:49,191
From my childhood my
dad, mom, school teacher,

594
00:34:49,495 --> 00:34:51,721
at last my wife didn't
scold me those many words.

595
00:34:52,249 --> 00:34:53,821
Tell me, why did you call me?

596
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,198
I made a call because I was
getting fired at my bottom.

597
00:34:56,222 --> 00:34:59,231
Should I show how much I am getting burnt?

598
00:35:00,027 --> 00:35:02,471
Hey, constables keep him in
jail along with the vessel.

599
00:35:27,027 --> 00:35:28,027
Where is Bairagi?

600
00:35:29,218 --> 00:35:32,436
Hello, brother asked me to bring you
because you were enquring about Bairagi.

601
00:35:34,376 --> 00:35:38,549
You are doing enqurie asking
people in public about Bairagi.

602
00:35:39,043 --> 00:35:40,043
Stop it.

603
00:35:40,369 --> 00:35:43,253
What is it? What is your
problem when I am doing my enquiry?

604
00:35:43,587 --> 00:35:45,187
Bairagi is the problem.

605
00:35:46,428 --> 00:35:48,803
I want to kill that
idiot who killed my dad

606
00:35:49,326 --> 00:35:51,954
and want to mark his blood to
the forhead of my fathers pic

607
00:35:52,282 --> 00:35:56,387
and I am waiting since 15
years to sit in his position.

608
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:57,587
Hey, nice ambition.

609
00:35:58,057 --> 00:35:59,561
We will get in danger because of you.

610
00:35:59,864 --> 00:36:00,864
Stop it.

611
00:36:01,294 --> 00:36:02,411
Stop the total enquiry.

612
00:36:02,662 --> 00:36:04,676
You will face problem if I
enquire by his name, right?

613
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,651
If I show his photo and enquire
about him then no problem right?

614
00:36:09,255 --> 00:36:11,415
- What photo man?
- I know how that Bairagi looks like.

615
00:36:11,554 --> 00:36:12,554
I have his photo.

616
00:36:12,727 --> 00:36:16,754
With the help of his photo I'll enquire
silently and I'll call you before kill him

617
00:36:17,082 --> 00:36:19,082
come and watch the film
and make it super hit okay.

618
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:26,367
Show me the photo. Check it man.

619
00:36:42,423 --> 00:36:45,841
Thinking that is Bairagi and
happily go and kill him, okay?

620
00:36:46,041 --> 00:36:47,041
- Hey!
- Ah!

621
00:36:47,299 --> 00:36:48,706
Show me the orignal photo.

622
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:51,807
Who will show who is Bairagi,
if you kill me brother?

623
00:36:53,655 --> 00:36:56,841
We all have the same revange,
that means we all are same,

624
00:36:57,136 --> 00:36:58,275
Please show me man.

625
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:02,040
If I show wouldn't you kill him first.

626
00:37:12,034 --> 00:37:17,101
Your revange is more that you would
kill the person who wants to kill him.

627
00:37:17,378 --> 00:37:20,353
Your range is some where in your revange.

628
00:37:20,553 --> 00:37:23,224
From today whatever
you say we will follow,

629
00:37:23,443 --> 00:37:25,680
you are only the hope for all of us.

630
00:37:26,531 --> 00:37:28,171
God is the only hope for hopeless person.

631
00:37:29,203 --> 00:37:30,283
Come on, let's go and find.

632
00:37:31,024 --> 00:37:32,871
Thank god!

633
00:37:33,859 --> 00:37:34,859
Just miss.

634
00:37:37,592 --> 00:37:39,595
Even I didn't like you
bowing before him brother.

635
00:37:39,795 --> 00:37:42,135
Hey,
he is only with us until we find Bairagi.

636
00:37:42,529 --> 00:37:46,006
After we find him I will
kill him along with Bairagi.

637
00:37:58,316 --> 00:38:00,543
Girl, what did you understood with this.

638
00:38:00,743 --> 00:38:03,072
That you don't required Allout master.

639
00:38:03,272 --> 00:38:05,902
Hey, I think she couldn't
understand short cuts and long drives,

640
00:38:06,102 --> 00:38:07,222
I have to tell her directly.

641
00:38:07,309 --> 00:38:08,309
No!

642
00:38:08,462 --> 00:38:10,114
Do you think this is a sword? No.

643
00:38:10,612 --> 00:38:12,104
It's stick for my family.

644
00:38:12,947 --> 00:38:14,267
Once upon a time in China people,

645
00:38:14,434 --> 00:38:17,129
stop coming out of their
houses because of Dengue disease.

646
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:18,889
My grandfather went out with this sword

647
00:38:19,042 --> 00:38:22,768
and slayed lakhs of heads of
Mosquitoes and saved China people,

648
00:38:22,968 --> 00:38:24,841
a small Mosquitoe landed on his neck,

649
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:28,408
in the process of slaying that
Mosquitoe's head he slayed his head too.

650
00:38:29,832 --> 00:38:32,799
With that Mosquitoes, my grandfather
and dengue these three were allout.

651
00:38:33,028 --> 00:38:35,880
That is why the company which kills
Mosquitoes kept it's name as Allout.

652
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:37,329
Wow!

653
00:38:37,636 --> 00:38:41,011
That is why

654
00:38:41,211 --> 00:38:42,331
I am going to teach you now.

655
00:38:42,589 --> 00:38:44,692
You have to hold the
sword tightly like this.

656
00:38:45,086 --> 00:38:48,178
With that hand you have to hold it
like this and take out like this.

657
00:38:48,378 --> 00:38:50,883
By setting position and
should keep correctly and...

658
00:38:51,083 --> 00:38:53,377
Oh no!

659
00:38:56,183 --> 00:38:56,749
Ah?

660
00:38:56,949 --> 00:38:59,309
You have to open the door and
come but not push it and come.

661
00:39:01,565 --> 00:39:02,565
Oh no!

662
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:10,589
Master, why is sauce pack in your stomach?

663
00:39:11,209 --> 00:39:12,409
You eat it without opening it?

664
00:39:12,752 --> 00:39:16,003
Hey, it didn't come from the
stomach it came from my pocket.

665
00:39:16,203 --> 00:39:18,048
- Oh-ho!
- By the way, why did you came?

666
00:39:18,248 --> 00:39:20,259
Hey, what is there in rule no. 64?

667
00:39:20,496 --> 00:39:22,896
- What is present?
- You will eat 4 Almond pieces in evening?

668
00:39:23,081 --> 00:39:24,081
- Yes.
- Here, take it.

669
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:26,955
Where are those 4 Almond
pieces in this plate man?

670
00:39:27,006 --> 00:39:30,183
Below the rule in bracket
there was written quality Almond's.

671
00:39:30,446 --> 00:39:32,050
So, I've tasted for testing.

672
00:39:32,594 --> 00:39:34,434
Then couldn't you bring
other 4 Almond's right?

673
00:39:34,544 --> 00:39:36,169
Hey, according to the rule
4 Almonds daily, right.

674
00:39:36,193 --> 00:39:36,838
Again tomorrow.

675
00:39:37,146 --> 00:39:39,587
Hey, why are you playing with my life?

676
00:39:39,787 --> 00:39:42,180
You came like Hudud in Vizag in my life.

677
00:39:42,538 --> 00:39:43,588
Hey, class figure.

678
00:39:45,875 --> 00:39:48,776
Master he is blinked his eye to me.

679
00:39:49,936 --> 00:39:51,696
What man you are
blinking your eyes it seems?

680
00:39:51,899 --> 00:39:53,578
Hey, what is the use to blink my eye?

681
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:54,759
I am following my rules.

682
00:39:55,016 --> 00:39:56,288
I am from very well mannered family.

683
00:39:56,312 --> 00:39:58,312
Well mannered family?
What rules are you following?

684
00:39:58,502 --> 00:40:03,909
According to rule number 64,
if anyone comes close to you by 9 feets,

685
00:40:04,167 --> 00:40:06,229
I have to keep an eye on them right?

686
00:40:06,581 --> 00:40:08,581
- Huh!
- That means we should close one eye right?

687
00:40:09,124 --> 00:40:11,604
If I close one eye I could know
that I have kept an eye, right?

688
00:40:40,705 --> 00:40:46,492
"Love is born when I saw you."

689
00:40:47,868 --> 00:40:53,650
"My heart slipped away and reached to you."

690
00:40:55,410 --> 00:41:00,630
"It's not new alike now these many days."

691
00:41:02,407 --> 00:41:07,996
"Don't know why it is sweeter."

692
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:12,434
"It's your magic dear."

693
00:41:17,376 --> 00:41:22,914
"Is it true that love
would be so peaceful?"

694
00:41:24,442 --> 00:41:29,767
"Is it true that love would be very nice?"

695
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:36,322
"Love is born when I saw you."

696
00:41:37,612 --> 00:41:43,489
"My heart slipped away and reached to you."

697
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:09,717
"Meeting you is like
1000 times in a second."

698
00:42:10,767 --> 00:42:16,667
"Forgetting me is not possible."

699
00:42:17,762 --> 00:42:20,569
"My steps are slipping towards you."

700
00:42:21,319 --> 00:42:24,190
"My way is found following you."

701
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:28,084
"The moments I walk with you are sweet."

702
00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:37,851
"Does the feeling of love
is fantastic for real?"

703
00:42:39,229 --> 00:42:44,590
"Does the feeling of loving a
person is fantastic for real?"

704
00:43:00,146 --> 00:43:06,046
"You are a sweet acquaintance."

705
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:13,173
"We can't weigh heart or air."

706
00:43:14,171 --> 00:43:17,140
"You are the language of my lips."

707
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:20,669
"You are the hope of my words."

708
00:43:21,421 --> 00:43:24,465
"Is your breath my life line?"

709
00:43:28,507 --> 00:43:33,802
"Does the feeling of love
is fantastic for real?"

710
00:43:35,483 --> 00:43:41,034
"Does the feeling of loving a
person is fantastic for real?"

711
00:43:55,835 --> 00:43:56,835
Sir! Sir! Sir!

712
00:43:58,637 --> 00:44:02,642
Where did the person went who was
sitting in front of you few moments ago?

713
00:44:02,898 --> 00:44:03,898
Who?

714
00:44:06,203 --> 00:44:07,243
He was the same guy right?

715
00:44:07,377 --> 00:44:09,412
Who is he? Who are you?

716
00:44:09,777 --> 00:44:11,816
Who is he? What is this nonsense to me?

717
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,720
Sir! Sir!

718
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:16,417
Please sir, tell me.

719
00:44:16,617 --> 00:44:17,617
Don't you know Telugu?

720
00:44:18,975 --> 00:44:19,975
I don't know.

721
00:44:48,535 --> 00:44:50,436
Chinese noodles.

722
00:44:57,917 --> 00:45:00,703
Did I made a Lion sweep these many days?

723
00:45:03,251 --> 00:45:04,251
Oh no!

724
00:45:07,651 --> 00:45:08,651
Oh no!

725
00:45:16,228 --> 00:45:20,423
What master? Why are you
shivering like that, are you feeling cold?

726
00:45:20,623 --> 00:45:21,920
I am getting afraid.

727
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,120
Sword?

728
00:45:23,734 --> 00:45:25,334
Why are you pronouncing sword like that?

729
00:45:25,545 --> 00:45:28,595
Hey, I saw in 2D that you
were swishing sword in 3D.

730
00:45:28,919 --> 00:45:30,870
Tell me truth.
You know martial arts right?

731
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:32,190
No. No, I don't know master.

732
00:45:32,309 --> 00:45:34,989
- I just know fine arts.
- Then what was that you doing down stairs?

733
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:36,550
I just sliced Guava.

734
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:38,513
Did you sliced Guava?

735
00:45:38,863 --> 00:45:39,969
Then what did you thought?

736
00:45:41,186 --> 00:45:43,004
- Show him again dude.
- Hey, no!

737
00:45:43,204 --> 00:45:45,858
I can't see that again,
because I've already seen it.

738
00:45:46,177 --> 00:45:47,177
- Ah!
- Hey!

739
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:55,519
Oh!

740
00:45:56,933 --> 00:45:57,933
- Hey!
- Yes?

741
00:45:58,052 --> 00:46:00,387
I am orignal, not graphical like you.

742
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:04,029
I killed these mosquitoes
because they were biting my darling.

743
00:46:04,645 --> 00:46:06,525
As I have killed those
who were just biting her.

744
00:46:06,735 --> 00:46:09,016
Then watch what would I do to
you who is taking advantage?

745
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,928
Dronacharya, took his finger in a war but.

746
00:46:12,028 --> 00:46:12,428
Ah!

747
00:46:12,633 --> 00:46:14,986
- Didn't interfere into his love matter.
- Yes, he didn't.

748
00:46:15,186 --> 00:46:16,547
- You are a master be like a master.
- Okay.

749
00:46:16,571 --> 00:46:18,331
- Else you will lose your reputation.
- Okay.

750
00:46:18,365 --> 00:46:19,482
- Hey!
- Alas!

751
00:46:20,627 --> 00:46:22,191
- There are many mosquitoes here.
- Okay.

752
00:46:22,215 --> 00:46:24,657
- Keep mosquitoe coil.
- Okay. May you live long!

753
00:46:34,882 --> 00:46:37,825
Hey, Ganesh! Why did you
warned master not to teach class?

754
00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:40,304
- Did he told you everything?
- Why have you come to the institute?

755
00:46:40,328 --> 00:46:42,424
- You have damaged my dream.
- What it is?

756
00:46:42,708 --> 00:46:44,068
Do you have any goal in your life?

757
00:46:44,155 --> 00:46:45,585
I even have Gold not just goal.

758
00:46:45,785 --> 00:46:47,785
You are coming in between
like a goal keeper to me.

759
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:51,676
Why haven't you drowned
in the Hudhud Cyclone?

760
00:46:51,876 --> 00:46:53,262
That day I was out of city.

761
00:46:53,528 --> 00:46:55,075
I will kill you if you talk smartly.

762
00:46:55,275 --> 00:46:56,275
- Ah!
- Damn!

763
00:46:56,661 --> 00:46:58,364
It's unnecessary to
talk to a guy like you.

764
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,300
Then talk to him.

765
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,255
- Lord Ganesh!
- Yes?

766
00:47:03,355 --> 00:47:06,581
If I have really watched
Vinayaka Vijayam film for hundred times.

767
00:47:06,781 --> 00:47:07,222
Oh god!

768
00:47:07,434 --> 00:47:09,888
If you believe that I am
really your true devotee.

769
00:47:10,088 --> 00:47:11,191
If you really exist.

770
00:47:11,693 --> 00:47:12,955
- Right now...
- Ah...

771
00:47:13,578 --> 00:47:15,200
- At this moment...
- Next.

772
00:47:15,632 --> 00:47:20,780
His hands and legs, eyes, kidney
and heart total body shouldn't work.

773
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Ganesh!

774
00:47:26,042 --> 00:47:26,750
- Yeah!
- Ganesh!

775
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:29,096
- Wow! Yes!
- Oh no! He really

776
00:47:29,584 --> 00:47:33,448
Ganesh, you are finished. Yea!

777
00:47:33,648 --> 00:47:36,119
Hey!

778
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,703
You idiot!

779
00:47:38,226 --> 00:47:39,226
Ah!

780
00:47:39,774 --> 00:47:41,269
Hey! Nothing happened to you right?

781
00:47:41,594 --> 00:47:42,714
I thought you were finished.

782
00:47:42,815 --> 00:47:44,422
Not me, she is finished.

783
00:47:44,622 --> 00:47:46,541
You acted greatly like Kamal
Haasan acted in Dasavathaaram film.

784
00:47:46,565 --> 00:47:48,806
Get lost, I am Ten plus Incarnations.

785
00:47:53,578 --> 00:47:55,021
Hell with them!

786
00:47:56,205 --> 00:47:57,540
- Did you saw him anywhere?
- No!

787
00:47:57,746 --> 00:47:59,338
- If you see him near by...
- Don't know.

788
00:47:59,362 --> 00:48:00,362
Hey!

789
00:48:00,666 --> 00:48:01,918
Greetings sir. Greetings.

790
00:48:02,263 --> 00:48:03,053
Hey, is that you?

791
00:48:03,253 --> 00:48:05,693
Why are you yet inside this
vessel like a Rat inside the hole?

792
00:48:06,045 --> 00:48:08,085
When I made the call to
that number and it was S. I.

793
00:48:08,395 --> 00:48:09,704
He wasn't S. I. He was I. S. I.

794
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:14,900
The total police department
banged me with sticks brother.

795
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,356
Brother,
as you have put me inside this vessel

796
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:20,660
they have banged me to the upper
body and my lower body is safe brother.

797
00:48:20,919 --> 00:48:24,126
Brother, that day few people took
you right? Where they have taken you?

798
00:48:24,454 --> 00:48:25,614
They took me to that Bairagi.

799
00:48:27,999 --> 00:48:29,559
- Is it?
- Yes, I even spoke with him too.

800
00:48:29,583 --> 00:48:30,583
What did you spoke sir?

801
00:48:31,302 --> 00:48:35,319
Er... He gave me this photo and
asked me to bring him immideatly.

802
00:48:35,819 --> 00:48:36,819
Bairagi, brother?

803
00:48:37,719 --> 00:48:38,839
I have seen him somewhere...

804
00:48:39,138 --> 00:48:40,256
Please remember him for once.

805
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:43,151
Oh no!
I can't remember until I drink alcohol.

806
00:48:43,482 --> 00:48:44,482
- What is it?
- Alcohol.

807
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:47,123
Ah... anyone would get
intoxicated by drinking alcohol,

808
00:48:47,612 --> 00:48:48,656
- but you remember?
- Yes.

809
00:48:51,025 --> 00:48:53,345
You have completed five
bottles yet you haven't remembered?

810
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:59,075
Brother, I remember my
grandpa Yadagiri when I see you.

811
00:48:59,715 --> 00:49:02,732
He gave me alcohol to
drink in my childhood like you

812
00:49:03,088 --> 00:49:06,224
and he use to give husk biscusts to eat.

813
00:49:06,624 --> 00:49:08,222
- Do you mean husk biscuits?
- Yes.

814
00:49:08,321 --> 00:49:09,521
Buffalos will eat those right?

815
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:14,210
I cannot remember this way,
can we swing and drink?

816
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:18,704
"Uyyalaina Jampalaina
song from the film Uyyala Jampala."

817
00:49:23,628 --> 00:49:25,075
Brother!

818
00:49:25,683 --> 00:49:28,009
Brother, did you remembered? Did you?

819
00:49:28,473 --> 00:49:29,810
- It's lost.
- What is it?

820
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:30,514
Photo.

821
00:49:30,755 --> 00:49:34,037
Ah!
If you lost that photo I will kill you.

822
00:49:37,991 --> 00:49:39,347
Brother, I found it.

823
00:49:40,823 --> 00:49:42,383
He looks same right? Even he has beard.

824
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:45,476
Brother, except searching the one
who is unknow, if you search him

825
00:49:45,766 --> 00:49:47,626
anyone in India will
tell about him right?

826
00:50:03,436 --> 00:50:08,767
"Hail Lord Ganesh... Hail Lord Ganesh."

827
00:50:13,921 --> 00:50:15,263
Lord, is it you?

828
00:50:15,532 --> 00:50:17,012
What did you thought I am Adnan Sami?

829
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:19,497
Even you are cracking jokes.

830
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,521
We've been living in humour since
birth, can't we crack jokes or what?

831
00:50:26,255 --> 00:50:28,898
Dad, this girl is my devotee Sahasra.

832
00:50:29,098 --> 00:50:32,440
Lord haven't Parvati madam came?

833

Tell her anything.

834
00:50:34,069 --> 00:50:36,242
Er... mom was seriously atching serials,

835
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:39,095
if we disturb her she would
get angry so we came sciently.

836
00:50:39,495 --> 00:50:41,390
Even you too have star connection?

837
00:50:41,590 --> 00:50:43,976
We are living in between stars

838
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,115
You just have Tata Sky we have total sky.

By the way, why did you came lord?

840
00:50:47,879 --> 00:50:49,127
You know that Ganesh right?

841
00:50:49,327 --> 00:50:52,293
- He is senseless, useless, careless...
- Non sense!

842
00:50:52,493 --> 00:50:55,048
Cool dad, cool, cool...

843
00:50:55,248 --> 00:50:57,466
Why did he do high jump like that?

844
00:50:57,666 --> 00:50:59,124
It wasn't high jump, it's high B. P.

845
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:00,900
As you have scolded that Ganesh.

846
00:51:01,273 --> 00:51:04,352
If anyone scolds his devotees he
would get anger and do like this.

847
00:51:04,703 --> 00:51:06,143
He is die hard devotee of my father.

848
00:51:07,498 --> 00:51:09,486
He likes that Ganesh more than me.

849
00:51:10,014 --> 00:51:12,762
If dad has three eyes that
Ganesh is the fourth eye.

850
00:51:13,129 --> 00:51:14,841
Because of you his hands and
legs stopped working right?

851
00:51:14,865 --> 00:51:17,315
Yes, lord that is all your power right?

852
00:51:17,515 --> 00:51:19,623
That is why dad took my powers.

853
00:51:20,205 --> 00:51:23,464
Look because of you I have loss my powers.

854
00:51:23,828 --> 00:51:25,590
I am now like a
transformer without powers.

855
00:51:25,897 --> 00:51:28,664
You have to do one thing if you
want me to get my powers back.

856
00:51:28,864 --> 00:51:29,921
What should I do lord?

857
00:51:30,339 --> 00:51:33,441
You help Ganesh to
recover as a normal person.

858
00:51:33,812 --> 00:51:37,076
When he became normal
then I would get my powers back.

859
00:51:37,276 --> 00:51:38,628
If not I'll become like a
generator for life long.

860
00:51:38,652 --> 00:51:40,312
You don't worry lord...

861
00:51:40,712 --> 00:51:43,137
I will make his legs and
hands to come back to normal.

862
00:51:43,337 --> 00:51:43,773
Okay.

863
00:51:43,973 --> 00:51:45,613
I will make your powers come back to you.

864
00:51:45,992 --> 00:51:47,403
It's my promise.

865
00:51:47,629 --> 00:51:48,629
Ah! We got in trouble.

866
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:55,280
Er... your mother has texted that
weather is not good. Come on let's go.

867
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:57,368
Even you also use mobile phones?

868
00:51:57,568 --> 00:51:58,568
Only I Phone.

869
00:51:58,674 --> 00:52:00,950
Er... If you turn back we
will get disappere dear.

870
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:02,340
How will you go lord?

871
00:52:02,651 --> 00:52:04,369
Mmm... On Rat?

872
00:52:04,606 --> 00:52:07,446
Rat is on a leave dear.
We borrowed Yamaha from Yama.

873
00:52:07,754 --> 00:52:10,274
We should go to Yamalok urgently.
Tell me what is the time dear.

874
00:52:10,405 --> 00:52:11,861
- I think time is 2:30 am.
- Shut your mouth.

875
00:52:11,885 --> 00:52:13,285
- Er...
- I know let's move come on.

876
00:52:13,925 --> 00:52:14,925
3:30 am...

877
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:16,740
You sat right?

878
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:18,790
Hey, Ganesh!
How can you leave your father and go?

879
00:52:19,091 --> 00:52:20,761
I think gods would go like this only.

880
00:52:21,932 --> 00:52:22,932
Hey, she came dude.

881
00:52:27,108 --> 00:52:28,108
Hold my mobile phone.

882
00:52:28,447 --> 00:52:30,348
Hey, sit in the position man!

883
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:35,552
- Hey!
- Good morning, come on.

884
00:52:39,366 --> 00:52:41,777
What did you came to see
whether my friend is alive or dead?

885
00:52:42,353 --> 00:52:44,957
Actually I don't know that
I have these many powers...

886
00:52:45,157 --> 00:52:45,752
- Oh god!
- Oh god!

887
00:52:45,952 --> 00:52:47,652
- And all those...
- Hey, be in position man!

888
00:52:47,676 --> 00:52:49,512
I have tested on you.

889
00:52:49,770 --> 00:52:51,268
Then what are you
thinking you want to do now?

890
00:52:51,292 --> 00:52:54,622
I want to make you normal by helping you.

891
00:52:54,822 --> 00:52:55,388
Then do it.

892
00:52:55,681 --> 00:52:58,337
From today I will make
you walk with my legs.

893
00:52:58,546 --> 00:52:59,546
Okay.

894
00:52:59,694 --> 00:53:02,529
- I will feed you with my hands.
- I will chew.

895
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:05,810
Then... where is the grinder?

896
00:53:06,037 --> 00:53:07,037
Look there it is...

897
00:53:07,959 --> 00:53:10,018
Is that a grinder?

898
00:53:10,218 --> 00:53:12,633
My mother doesn't follow
trend she will follow tradition.

899
00:53:12,833 --> 00:53:14,614
That is mixer.

900
00:53:15,482 --> 00:53:17,259
That is washing machine with water tank.

901
00:53:18,786 --> 00:53:19,786
This is vaccum cleaner.

902
00:53:20,175 --> 00:53:21,175
Ah!

903
00:53:21,219 --> 00:53:23,197
- First start with cleaning.
- Okay.

904
00:53:34,766 --> 00:53:36,929
If my mother see her...

905
00:53:37,299 --> 00:53:40,179
- She thinks she is a working girl.
- She would think that she is a maid.

906
00:53:45,316 --> 00:53:46,853
Why she fell down really?

907
00:53:47,098 --> 00:53:49,145
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

908
00:53:56,322 --> 00:53:58,165
Didn't you hands and legs stopped working?

909
00:53:58,365 --> 00:54:00,447
That is due to the tension
that you might fall down,

910
00:54:00,647 --> 00:54:03,207
my hands and legs which stopped
working came running to save you.

911
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:06,542
- Hello?
- What?

912
00:54:07,345 --> 00:54:09,505
Did you forgot or are you
thinking that I've forgotten?

913
00:54:10,021 --> 00:54:10,477
For you

914
00:54:10,677 --> 00:54:12,754
I and your friends are waiting come.

915
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:18,246
This all happened because of you.
I have to hit you not that fellow.

916
00:54:19,846 --> 00:54:21,526
- Leave me.
- You have to hit him, come on.

917
00:54:35,325 --> 00:54:37,115
Sahasra he troubled us a lot here.

918
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:40,690
What man does she brought you
because she couldn't hit me?

919
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:42,080
I don't hit ladies guys.

920
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:42,931
- What?
- Ganesh.

921
00:54:43,031 --> 00:54:44,031
You people settle down.

922
00:54:44,549 --> 00:54:45,290
What are you saying?

923
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:47,570
You can stare me later,
first settle down his matter.

924
00:54:48,193 --> 00:54:49,668
Come on, it's ladies issue.

925
00:54:51,029 --> 00:54:52,547
I didn't make her to serve me.

926
00:54:53,139 --> 00:54:54,424
I made her practice to bash him.

927
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:57,579
Listen, if man goes to
institute to learn martial arts

928
00:54:57,854 --> 00:55:00,285
then a woman who does every
work in home is martial arts.

929
00:55:00,646 --> 00:55:02,621
You who light fire to cook,

930
00:55:03,093 --> 00:55:07,697
if you come on the street if you got hurt,
you can roll them like a grinder,

931
00:55:08,447 --> 00:55:10,073
bash them like bashing chilli.

932
00:55:10,341 --> 00:55:14,266
Mix them like batter,
can wash like washing clothes

933
00:55:14,647 --> 00:55:17,555
and dry them in Sun keeping clips.

934
00:55:17,755 --> 00:55:20,595
Even five elements of the nature
gets shock by see the punch of a woman.

935
00:55:20,862 --> 00:55:22,007
Is he a thing?

936
00:55:29,419 --> 00:55:30,419
Come on.

937
00:55:38,606 --> 00:55:39,606
Yes!

938
00:55:57,281 --> 00:55:58,281
Hmm...

939
00:56:00,644 --> 00:56:01,684
Do you know you are super?

940
00:56:01,844 --> 00:56:03,724
Do you know Superman?

941
00:56:03,924 --> 00:56:05,851
Er... what am I talking
and what you are talking?

942
00:56:06,051 --> 00:56:08,253
We both are talking
about super only right?

943
00:56:08,453 --> 00:56:09,479
Er...

944
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:10,679
Are you kidding me?

945
00:56:25,421 --> 00:56:27,285
"I'm in love."

946
00:56:28,981 --> 00:56:31,129
"I've entered into love frame."

947
00:56:32,842 --> 00:56:36,183
"I'm in love.
I've entered into love frame."

948
00:56:36,691 --> 00:56:39,043
"The ring on my finger is yours."

949
00:56:40,378 --> 00:56:43,856
"I dreamt about you,
I assumed about you"

950
00:56:44,224 --> 00:56:46,947
"I took your last name."

951
00:56:48,157 --> 00:56:49,764
"You are my darling."

952
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:53,420
"What a feeling!"

953
00:56:55,751 --> 00:56:57,275
"You are my darling."

954
00:56:59,454 --> 00:57:01,076
"What a feeling!"

955
00:57:10,778 --> 00:57:14,008
"I'm in love. I took risk."

956
00:57:14,642 --> 00:57:16,936
"I gave my heart to you."

957
00:57:18,257 --> 00:57:21,564
"I got mixed feelings,
but I fixed my mind on you."

958
00:57:22,167 --> 00:57:24,670
"I'll be wedding you."

959
00:57:25,991 --> 00:57:27,422
"You are my darling."

960
00:57:29,816 --> 00:57:31,344
"What a feeling!"

961
00:57:33,552 --> 00:57:35,093
"You are my darling."

962
00:57:37,302 --> 00:57:38,838
"What a feeling!"

963
00:57:45,116 --> 00:57:48,612
"You are my darling. Come on the way,
you're blazing everything filling it now."

964
00:57:48,973 --> 00:57:52,154
"All my crazy feeling are rising,
Baby let it go. Loving it now."

965
00:57:52,354 --> 00:57:55,953
"Would you love me baby? Feel me everytime
making my way to the beautiful world."

966
00:57:56,153 --> 00:57:59,758
"Darling... Feeling...
Come on baby, settle this now."

967
00:58:07,715 --> 00:58:10,744
"Come to the turning, I took a halt."

968
00:58:11,376 --> 00:58:14,758
"We got double seats for single window."

969
00:58:15,339 --> 00:58:18,534
"My story got tempted in the beginning."

970
00:58:18,734 --> 00:58:22,094
"This sweet girl made me
fall for her at the ending."

971
00:58:22,770 --> 00:58:26,263
"I set the field and
you've bowled me."

972
00:58:26,647 --> 00:58:29,614
"You've built our lifelong match."

973
00:58:30,335 --> 00:58:31,888
"You are my darling."

974
00:58:34,057 --> 00:58:35,611
"What a feeling!"

975
00:58:37,787 --> 00:58:39,338
"You are my darling."

976
00:58:41,594 --> 00:58:43,064
"What a feeling!"

977
00:59:09,994 --> 00:59:13,145
"Your belt tightened my dress."

978
00:59:13,801 --> 00:59:17,086
"You've impressed me with your fight."

979
00:59:17,551 --> 00:59:20,765
"You've set your time in my watch."

980
00:59:21,261 --> 00:59:24,632
"Your moves started with my stare."

981
00:59:25,079 --> 00:59:28,694
"I have tweeted and
you've sent heat waves."

982
00:59:29,015 --> 00:59:32,223
"Both of us got separated from the world."

983
00:59:32,609 --> 00:59:34,107
"You are my darling."

984
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:37,924
"What a feeling!"

985
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:41,751
"You are my darling."

986
00:59:44,006 --> 00:59:45,413
"What a feeling!"

987
01:00:06,659 --> 01:00:09,475
What's up Bairagi,
you seem to be happy today?

988
01:00:09,650 --> 01:00:11,895
In the morning,
a guy came to our garage,

989
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:15,928
and extorted money from me
citing that he's Bairagi's henchman.

990
01:00:16,093 --> 01:00:17,233
You should have killed that idiot!

991
01:00:17,257 --> 01:00:20,298
I liked the way he
threatened me by using my name.

992
01:00:20,458 --> 01:00:23,483
We can imagine the form of God but,

993
01:00:24,219 --> 01:00:26,501
not Bairagi's form.

994
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:27,749
The kick from this booze,

995
01:00:27,956 --> 01:00:30,717
doesn't even match the one that came
from that extortion, Nalla Swamy.

996
01:00:44,896 --> 01:00:45,896
Nalla Swamy!

997
01:00:48,483 --> 01:00:50,900
Byaragi, someone drew your sketch.

998
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:53,483
Who the hell is he? I want him.

999
01:00:54,386 --> 01:00:54,826
Hello.

1000
01:00:55,176 --> 01:00:56,868
- What's this, sir?
- What happened?

1001
01:00:57,045 --> 01:01:01,413
Someone showed me the picture of
Bairagi and asked me whether I knew him.

1002
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:04,598
You have sent that guy
to test me, didn't you?

1003
01:01:04,658 --> 01:01:07,719
You fool, why would I send him?

1004
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:10,062
- Where is he now?
- I don't know, sir.

1005
01:01:10,287 --> 01:01:12,776
- Can you recognise him if you see him?
- Yes, I can.

1006
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:19,752
I'll get the guy who drew your sketch
within 24 hours and bring him to you.

1007
01:01:25,135 --> 01:01:29,191
I can't find his photos but I
remember where I saw him, brother.

1008
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,310
- Where?
- At Kanakaraja's Paan shop.

1009
01:01:34,758 --> 01:01:37,716
Our guy saw Bairagi when he
was smoking at this place.

1010
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:41,451
This is the place where he
had shown me the sketch.

1011
01:01:41,475 --> 01:01:43,555
We might find him if we
search in these surroundings.

1012
01:01:44,244 --> 01:01:47,142
We can definitely find him if
we search in these surroundings.

1013
01:02:04,104 --> 01:02:06,124
Why did a lot of people gather
over there? What's happening?

1014
01:02:06,148 --> 01:02:07,437
He wants to catch a guy.

1015
01:02:07,613 --> 01:02:08,820
And it was told that the guy they
are looking came here yesterday.

1016
01:02:08,844 --> 01:02:10,527
They announced a bounty of 50,000
rupees for identifying that guy.

1017
01:02:10,551 --> 01:02:11,569
- 50,000 rupees?
- Yes.

1018
01:02:11,886 --> 01:02:13,705
Hey, give way... Move...

1019
01:02:14,213 --> 01:02:15,621
This is my area.

1020
01:02:15,861 --> 01:02:18,727
I should be the one who should
do business or extortion!

1021
01:02:19,022 --> 01:02:20,377
Bro, who are you looking for?

1022
01:02:20,522 --> 01:02:21,602
He is still drawing, right?

1023
01:02:21,827 --> 01:02:23,169
You can identify and tell
us after he finishes it.

1024
01:02:23,193 --> 01:02:25,793
I will definitely recognise him.
Meanwhile, arrange 50,000 rupees.

1025
01:02:26,093 --> 01:02:29,402
Hey, I'm Bairagi's
henchman. Bugger off from here.

1026
01:02:30,343 --> 01:02:34,230
Wow! Soothing!

1027
01:02:38,865 --> 01:02:39,889
He is the one, sir.

1028
01:02:43,767 --> 01:02:45,607
Look there, he is that guy...
He is that guy...

1029
01:02:58,065 --> 01:02:59,065
Ah!

1030
01:03:06,572 --> 01:03:08,000
Hey - Tell me, brother!

1031
01:03:08,171 --> 01:03:09,171
Hey, stop dude!

1032
01:03:09,343 --> 01:03:09,831
Tell me, brother!

1033
01:03:09,895 --> 01:03:12,265
Until yesterday, I was the only person
who searched for that guy in the sketch.

1034
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:15,789
But from today, 50 men are
searching for him to kill. Have a look.

1035
01:03:18,593 --> 01:03:21,613
I've searched at the place that
you have told me. He wasn't there.

1036
01:03:21,906 --> 01:03:24,231
If you see him anywhere, call me.

1037
01:03:24,484 --> 01:03:25,484
Hey, note down my number.

1038
01:03:26,451 --> 01:03:28,371
Hey, he was talking to you.
Note down the number.

1039
01:03:29,551 --> 01:03:32,042
8978183998

1040
01:03:38,846 --> 01:03:39,575
Hello, who is on the line?

1041
01:03:39,641 --> 01:03:41,329
- Your friend.
- My friend?

1042
01:03:41,697 --> 01:03:45,508
When we have a common
enemy, aren't we friends?

1043
01:03:45,708 --> 01:03:47,465
- Who is that enemy?
- Bairagi.

1044
01:03:48,867 --> 01:03:52,263
I'm too seeking vengeance
against Bairagi just like you.

1045
01:03:52,531 --> 01:03:54,267
But I don't have the courage to kill him.

1046
01:03:54,519 --> 01:03:57,651
You know only his face.

1047
01:03:58,035 --> 01:04:01,094
But I know where he resides.

1048
01:04:01,789 --> 01:04:05,006
He does every deal on Yarada Hills.

1049
01:04:06,757 --> 01:04:08,732
He already started to
that place to make a deal.

1050
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:13,372
He might be reach there in 15 minutes.

1051
01:04:26,731 --> 01:04:30,054
Bairagi, that's the gang
which wants to kill you.

1052
01:04:41,435 --> 01:04:44,669
That's the guy who was
enquiring about you with your sketch.

1053
01:04:46,476 --> 01:04:50,909
Hey, this is my father's axe which
I have sharpened after 15 years.

1054
01:04:57,194 --> 01:05:01,877
The change in his body language
means that he is Bairagi for sure.

1055
01:05:02,826 --> 01:05:06,035
First, we shall kill
Bairagi and later him.

1056
01:05:06,153 --> 01:05:07,194
Let's kill both of them.

1057
01:05:08,017 --> 01:05:10,592
He is coming towards us
seeking his death, Bairagi.

1058
01:05:13,871 --> 01:05:16,369
One swing of the
sword shall chop 10 heads.

1059
01:05:16,530 --> 01:05:18,801
It might scare you.
Close your eyes, Nalla Swamy.

1060
01:05:47,729 --> 01:05:48,729
Hey!

1061
01:05:59,224 --> 01:06:02,573
"Jakkara... Jakkara... Jakkanna."

1062
01:06:06,033 --> 01:06:07,411
Did you kill him?

1063
01:06:11,193 --> 01:06:12,193
Hey...

1064
01:06:25,073 --> 01:06:26,084
Hey...

1065
01:07:10,242 --> 01:07:12,174
Hey...

1066
01:07:16,974 --> 01:07:18,658
Hey...

1067
01:08:01,306 --> 01:08:02,306
Hey...

1068
01:08:16,978 --> 01:08:20,375
What the hell are you doing when these
many people are out there to kill you?

1069
01:08:22,409 --> 01:08:23,729
I killed them because you didn't.

1070
01:08:25,355 --> 01:08:28,012
If anyone wants to lay their hands on you,

1071
01:08:28,524 --> 01:08:31,106
their expiry date would be
over on this earth just like them.

1072
01:08:33,134 --> 01:08:37,934
Brother, I would generally transform
the lives of those who helped me.

1073
01:08:38,321 --> 01:08:40,573
And when it comes to you,
you've done a great help to me.

1074
01:08:43,485 --> 01:08:47,179
From today, you are my God
and I'm your bodyguard.

1075
01:08:49,038 --> 01:08:50,979
Trust me, I'm going to
make your life incredible.

1076
01:08:52,110 --> 01:08:54,726
This is the first step of my gratitude.

1077
01:08:54,738 --> 01:08:56,913
Step by step, it will very exciting.

1078
01:08:58,669 --> 01:09:00,035
This is the blood of 50 idiots.

1079
01:09:02,342 --> 01:09:05,567
"Jakkara... Jakkara... Jakkanna."

1080
01:09:08,115 --> 01:09:11,503
Hi, our Ganesh has started
showing his gratitude.

1081
01:09:11,795 --> 01:09:13,823
Go and get something to drink.

1082
01:09:13,883 --> 01:09:15,646
I meant coffee or tea.

1083
01:09:15,836 --> 01:09:19,500
Because his enthusiasm may not fetch
you any gap to get refreshments.

1084
01:09:27,474 --> 01:09:29,490
What is the help that I did to him?

1085
01:09:29,611 --> 01:09:31,451
You might have helped
him without my knowledge.

1086
01:09:31,899 --> 01:09:35,143
Am I a Prime Minister a
to help him? I'm a rowdy.

1087
01:09:35,235 --> 01:09:39,394
By looking at his strength, I think
there is some strong reason behind this.

1088
01:09:39,683 --> 01:09:45,532
Get all those people who are known
to him, met him and related to him.

1089
01:09:48,853 --> 01:09:49,853
Ho!

1090
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:52,947
This is the first time in
the history of this institute

1091
01:09:52,991 --> 01:09:53,731
that these many people came to join.

1092
01:09:53,883 --> 01:09:55,631
Bairagi asked you to come
to his place. Let's go.

1093
01:09:55,655 --> 01:09:58,782
Jackie Chan, Pawan Kalyan and I
won't visit anyone at their place.

1094
01:09:58,874 --> 01:09:59,620
Ask Bairagi to come here.

1095
01:09:59,795 --> 01:10:00,899
Oh man!

1096
01:10:05,554 --> 01:10:08,946
I'm not a cooking teacher to go to
houses privately and teach them.

1097
01:10:09,176 --> 01:10:09,627
Ho!

1098
01:10:10,049 --> 01:10:11,082
I'm a stunt master.

1099
01:10:11,142 --> 01:10:13,918
Hey, it would be fun to go near the ocean.

1100
01:10:13,999 --> 01:10:16,119
But when the ocean comes to
you, it is called Tsunami.

1101
01:10:16,184 --> 01:10:18,076
However, why the hell do you
need martial arts at this age?

1102
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:19,908
You will be dead
before you finish warm-up.

1103
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:22,720
The taste is very bad.

1104
01:10:22,842 --> 01:10:24,074
Hey - What?

1105
01:10:24,249 --> 01:10:26,180
- Do you know Bairagi?
- Bairagi?

1106
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:28,790
Of course, I do.

1107
01:10:29,034 --> 01:10:30,874
The entire city trembles
upon hearing his name.

1108
01:10:30,932 --> 01:10:32,412
But he trembles upon hearing my name.

1109
01:10:32,479 --> 01:10:35,395
You fool, he is Bairagi.

1110
01:10:35,555 --> 01:10:40,120
Him?

1111
01:10:41,601 --> 01:10:44,225
If he is Bairagi,
then I'm Bin Laden.

1112
01:10:44,787 --> 01:10:45,787
Oh no!

1113
01:10:47,518 --> 01:10:49,311
I understood everything, brother.

1114
01:10:49,345 --> 01:10:51,122
Where is your office boy, Ganesh?

1115
01:10:51,999 --> 01:10:53,719
Oh no! Is it about him?

1116
01:10:53,836 --> 01:10:54,893
Did he annoy you too?

1117
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:58,209
Like the signals reaching
the SIM card wherever it is,

1118
01:10:58,354 --> 01:11:01,698
he will come running to his lover
for even a small scratch on her body.

1119
01:11:01,833 --> 01:11:02,833
Where is she?

1120
01:11:02,927 --> 01:11:04,229
You should stay away from bad people.

1121
01:11:04,253 --> 01:11:07,072
- Hey... Hey... Stop here.
- This is the place. Stop.

1122
01:11:07,573 --> 01:11:09,718
Brother, this is the
house of Ganesh's lover.

1123
01:11:11,201 --> 01:11:13,313
Actually, she was my
girl at the beginning.

1124
01:11:13,513 --> 01:11:14,824
She became his lover
only after my episode.

1125
01:11:14,848 --> 01:11:17,872
Which means I made the
layout and he got the venture.

1126
01:11:17,932 --> 01:11:18,932
What do I lack, brother?

1127
01:11:18,990 --> 01:11:20,150
I pat on my thighs and swear,

1128
01:11:20,268 --> 01:11:22,460
I'm the only guy in this in
entire Vizag city with a plait.

1129
01:11:22,484 --> 01:11:26,104
Oh man! You'll find my girl in this
house who would be so beautiful that,

1130
01:11:26,352 --> 01:11:28,557
words are not enough
to describe her beauty.

1131
01:11:30,346 --> 01:11:33,337
Her lips are so beautiful
that it would blow our minds.

1132
01:11:33,652 --> 01:11:37,432
Brother, destroy Ganesh by all
means and get that girl to me.

1133
01:11:39,155 --> 01:11:40,155
Brother.

1134
01:11:49,063 --> 01:11:50,063
Is it true?

1135
01:11:50,236 --> 01:11:53,086
Did I flirt with the
sister of a ferocious man?

1136
01:11:55,168 --> 01:11:56,168
Oh dear...

1137
01:11:56,511 --> 01:11:57,511
Hey!

1138
01:11:57,591 --> 01:12:02,055
You didn't know that someone is in
love with my sister until I know,

1139
01:12:02,355 --> 01:12:03,536
What the hell are you doing?

1140
01:12:04,391 --> 01:12:05,463
- Brother, please...
- Don't talk.

1141
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:07,828
Forget the guy who is in love with you.

1142
01:12:08,073 --> 01:12:09,073
He will not live.

1143
01:12:10,362 --> 01:12:11,718
I'll kill him.

1144
01:12:14,015 --> 01:12:17,583
He didn't even spare his father and kicked
him. In my case, I'll be made as jelly.

1145
01:12:19,098 --> 01:12:23,495
Sorry, brother. I blabbered as I
didn't know it was your sister.

1146
01:12:23,535 --> 01:12:24,956
Don't hit me brother, I'll die.

1147
01:12:25,116 --> 01:12:26,911
Shall I bury him, Bairagi?

1148
01:12:27,133 --> 01:12:28,326
What will you bury?

1149
01:12:28,402 --> 01:12:29,402
Am I a plant to you?

1150
01:12:29,430 --> 01:12:31,177
Tell me brother.
Isn't your mother my mother?

1151
01:12:31,201 --> 01:12:32,321
Isn't your sister my sister?

1152
01:12:32,433 --> 01:12:33,473
Isn't your wife my wife?

1153
01:12:35,656 --> 01:12:36,689
Nalla Swamy,

1154
01:12:37,661 --> 01:12:42,014
He trapped my sister
in order to target me.

1155
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:44,671
He should be dead.

1156
01:12:55,505 --> 01:12:57,437
I didn't come for you this time.

1157
01:12:58,044 --> 01:12:59,924
It was me who called you to come here.

1158
01:13:01,264 --> 01:13:05,128
Your lover Sahasra is my daughter.

1159
01:13:06,997 --> 01:13:09,397
She is the sister of Bairagi
whom you are searching for.

1160
01:13:12,425 --> 01:13:14,465
Does it mean Bairagi is your son?

1161
01:13:14,733 --> 01:13:17,937
In order to know that you
should know what happened.

1162
01:13:18,137 --> 01:13:19,897
ANDHRA PRADESH
GOVERNMENT SUB REGISTER OFFICE

1163
01:13:20,406 --> 01:13:21,536
Congratulations - Thanks.

1164
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:23,190
- Greetings ma'am.
- Greetings sir.

1165
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:25,737
Happy married life.

1166
01:13:26,081 --> 01:13:27,233
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

1167
01:13:27,257 --> 01:13:29,033
You had a daughter. Where is she?

1168
01:13:29,342 --> 01:13:31,239
- Huh? Daughter?
- Daughter?

1169
01:13:31,327 --> 01:13:33,823
We got married just now.
How will we have a daughter?

1170
01:13:34,094 --> 01:13:35,814
It's been seven years
that you were married.

1171
01:13:36,866 --> 01:13:38,960
You had a seven year old daughter.

1172
01:13:39,244 --> 01:13:41,656
I think he came from the
mental hospital. Let's go.

1173
01:13:42,564 --> 01:13:44,372
It's been seven years
that we were married.

1174
01:13:45,092 --> 01:13:46,660
We had a seven year old daughter.

1175
01:13:46,925 --> 01:13:49,477
I selected you as the
father of my sister by your fear.

1176
01:13:50,004 --> 01:13:52,346
My sister is an obstruction for my growth.

1177
01:13:53,068 --> 01:13:55,309
That's why you are her parents from today.

1178
01:13:55,392 --> 01:13:56,226
Okay.

1179
01:13:56,295 --> 01:13:59,640
If you take care of her,
I'll take care of everything you want.

1180
01:14:00,351 --> 01:14:03,871
Otherwise, you will see me and
there is no person alive who saw me.

1181
01:14:04,071 --> 01:14:05,776
Well, where is my daughter?

1182
01:14:06,408 --> 01:14:10,897
Along with Sahasra,
I got wealth and properties in that way.

1183
01:14:11,154 --> 01:14:16,146
Sahasra, who got me everything
asked me nothing for her,

1184
01:14:17,175 --> 01:14:18,255
Except you.

1185
01:14:18,347 --> 01:14:22,171
Take her far away and live happily.

1186
01:14:22,481 --> 01:14:27,608
Because I know about Bairagi's
wickedness more than anyone.

1187
01:14:28,475 --> 01:14:30,667
Sahasra will be waiting for you.

1188
01:14:39,522 --> 01:14:40,009
Hey!

1189
01:14:40,185 --> 01:14:43,078
Heard that you've been searching for me.

1190
01:14:43,911 --> 01:14:46,296
Why do you take such pain?
I'd come to you if you call me.

1191
01:14:47,539 --> 01:14:51,899
Come to Savitri Tiffin Center
which is at NTR Center in the morning.

1192
01:14:52,555 --> 01:14:54,835
Don't be late.
Let's talk over breakfast.

1193
01:15:23,061 --> 01:15:24,061
Bairagi...

1194
01:15:24,909 --> 01:15:25,909
Bairagi...

1195
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:28,280
Bairagi...

1196
01:15:30,857 --> 01:15:31,857
Bairagi...

1197
01:15:32,155 --> 01:15:33,891
He is... He is Bairagi...

1198
01:15:36,943 --> 01:15:38,096
He is Bairagi...

1199
01:15:39,770 --> 01:15:40,770
Oh no! Bairagi.

1200
01:15:40,881 --> 01:15:43,041
- He is the one who is on the poster.
- Oh no! Bairagi!

1201
01:15:46,733 --> 01:15:48,233
I'm Bairagi's henchman.

1202
01:15:48,537 --> 01:15:51,517
Oh no! He is Bairagi.

1203
01:15:51,941 --> 01:15:52,941
Oh no!

1204
01:15:53,017 --> 01:15:56,594
Brother... Brother... Brother...

1205
01:15:58,042 --> 01:16:00,911
Brother, we don't know
that you are Bairagi.

1206
01:16:01,329 --> 01:16:04,257
We've been living in this
place by using your name.

1207
01:16:04,265 --> 01:16:06,120
Hey, stop your mess!

1208
01:16:06,983 --> 01:16:08,303
Brother, please show mercy on us.

1209
01:16:08,332 --> 01:16:11,058
What the hell are you staring at? Fool!

1210
01:16:11,397 --> 01:16:13,173
Won't you tell us that he is Bairagi?

1211
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:18,490
Hit me brother... Hit me otherwise
I'll stab myself.

1212
01:16:19,236 --> 01:16:20,236
Bairagi, he is calling.

1213
01:16:22,047 --> 01:16:23,047
Hey!

1214
01:16:23,112 --> 01:16:25,832
How is your poster?
Blockbuster, isn't it?

1215
01:16:25,993 --> 01:16:26,993
Hit me, brother.

1216
01:16:27,026 --> 01:16:29,364
The public response is good, ain't it?

1217
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:31,252
Where the hell are you?

1218
01:16:31,576 --> 01:16:34,448
I'm at Siripuram junction taking the
tension of getting your posters pasted.

1219
01:16:34,472 --> 01:16:35,472
Come here immediately.

1220
01:16:35,644 --> 01:16:37,383
Stay there, I'm coming.

1221
01:16:37,577 --> 01:16:38,250
Don't go Bairagi.

1222
01:16:38,345 --> 01:16:40,383
When he had revealed
about you to the entire city,

1223
01:16:40,707 --> 01:16:42,123
it means that he had
planned something else for you.

1224
01:16:42,147 --> 01:16:44,096
He did what he has to.

1225
01:16:44,551 --> 01:16:46,415
Now, it is my turn.

1226
01:16:46,792 --> 01:16:47,792
- Come with me!
- Brother.

1227
01:16:54,691 --> 01:16:55,828
Hey... Hey... Hey...

1228
01:17:05,968 --> 01:17:07,261
Hey!

1229
01:17:07,678 --> 01:17:09,041
I pasted your poster
on every autorickshaw,

1230
01:17:09,065 --> 01:17:10,413
I don't know if it is right or wrong.

1231
01:17:10,437 --> 01:17:12,103
Hey, where the hell are you?

1232
01:17:12,628 --> 01:17:17,031
I'm at Maddilapalem roadside enjoying
people's cheer at your vinyl poster.

1233
01:17:21,261 --> 01:17:24,501
- I'm at Maddilapalem, where are you?
- Turn around, come back to Gajuwaka center.

1234
01:17:28,271 --> 01:17:29,649
Hey, vacate this place.

1235
01:17:29,901 --> 01:17:31,101
Where the hell are you?

1236
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:35,487
I'm like your backbone.
Turn to your back.

1237
01:17:37,049 --> 01:17:38,049
Whoa!

1238
01:17:39,334 --> 01:17:43,238
He made even me as a scapegoat in
the process of catching Bairagi.

1239
01:17:47,454 --> 01:17:49,183
The poster tore, and out came the hero.

1240
01:17:49,495 --> 01:17:50,495
How is it?

1241
01:17:50,953 --> 01:17:52,868
Brother, I'll take your photo.

1242
01:17:53,856 --> 01:17:56,064
- You come inside the frame, dude.
- Brother, lay your hand on me.

1243
01:17:56,088 --> 01:17:57,668
Ready... Don't blink your eyes.

1244
01:17:58,489 --> 01:17:59,489
The photo is incredible.

1245
01:17:59,778 --> 01:18:03,521
If I upload this photo on the internet,
you will become famous globally.

1246
01:18:04,777 --> 01:18:06,624
There will be tweets about you on Twitter

1247
01:18:06,699 --> 01:18:08,288
and you'd get likes on Facebook.

1248
01:18:08,464 --> 01:18:11,356
And everyone would say hats off
to you on Whatsapp.

1249
01:18:11,456 --> 01:18:13,408
- Give him a big round of applause.
- Shut up!

1250
01:18:13,552 --> 01:18:17,504
You'll become famous with this photo.

1251
01:18:18,188 --> 01:18:20,576
Bairagi should be like a
lion standing at the center.

1252
01:18:21,801 --> 01:18:24,946
People want their photo to
be on the cover page.

1253
01:18:25,142 --> 01:18:27,133
But why do you want your
photo on the last page?

1254
01:18:27,241 --> 01:18:28,365
I didn't like that.

1255
01:18:28,574 --> 01:18:32,394
That's why I put your posters all over
the city and gave you free publicity.

1256
01:18:32,841 --> 01:18:34,062
Who the hell are you to put my posters?

1257
01:18:34,086 --> 01:18:36,220
Fan. I'm your fan!

1258
01:18:36,364 --> 01:18:37,989
Why the hell would I have fans?

1259
01:18:38,050 --> 01:18:40,433
The movie heroes who save
lives in the movies have fans.

1260
01:18:40,564 --> 01:18:42,964
You are the one who saved my life in real
life and helped me.

1261
01:18:43,037 --> 01:18:44,037
Shouldn't I be your fan?

1262
01:18:44,069 --> 01:18:45,498
Why are you just staring? Speak out!

1263
01:18:45,522 --> 01:18:49,459
You've been torturing me saying that
I helped you. What was that help?

1264
01:18:49,559 --> 01:18:50,751
Did you forget it?

1265
01:18:51,092 --> 01:18:56,351
You came to VUDA park to kill
Dega 15 years ago, didn't you?

1266
01:18:56,487 --> 01:18:57,487
Try to recall it.

1267
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:01,287
SABBAVARAM MANDALA
PARISHAT HIGH SCHOOL FIELD TRIP

1268
01:19:10,386 --> 01:19:13,288
Who the hell did hit me with the ball?

1269
01:19:15,933 --> 01:19:18,933
It was me, uncle. I'm sorry.

1270
01:19:18,993 --> 01:19:19,844
Give me the ball.

1271
01:19:19,936 --> 01:19:20,697
What happened, uncle?

1272
01:19:20,889 --> 01:19:22,635
Sorry? You idiot!

1273
01:19:22,834 --> 01:19:23,834
Stop!

1274
01:19:25,474 --> 01:19:27,314
Why are you hitting him
even after his apology?

1275
01:19:27,734 --> 01:19:29,334
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm his friend.

1276
01:19:29,522 --> 01:19:31,794
He tied me a band-aid when
I got bruised recently.

1277
01:19:31,853 --> 01:19:34,403
Don't scold him. Anyway,
it was a small hit for you.

1278
01:19:34,717 --> 01:19:36,492
Just rub with some
ointment, the pain will be healed.

1279
01:19:36,516 --> 01:19:37,162
Hey Srinu, pick the ball.

1280
01:19:37,512 --> 01:19:38,512
Yes - Hey...

1281
01:19:39,421 --> 01:19:41,818
- Do you know who I'm?
- No.

1282
01:19:42,018 --> 01:19:45,098
I'll speak in this way even if I know you.
I won't be silent if you scold him.

1283
01:19:45,668 --> 01:19:46,308
Ouch!

1284
01:19:46,683 --> 01:19:48,735
I've hit him.
What are you going to do about it?

1285
01:19:49,084 --> 01:19:50,444
Now, I can't do anything about it.

1286
01:19:50,811 --> 01:19:52,936
But you'd be old by the time I grow up.

1287
01:19:53,366 --> 01:19:54,844
I'll slap you at that time.

1288
01:19:54,854 --> 01:19:57,819
I'm not gonna let you grow
up. I'll kill you now.

1289
01:19:58,109 --> 01:19:58,637
Give me the axe.

1290
01:19:58,844 --> 01:20:00,333
- Take your leg off me.
- Don't harm him. Please...

1291
01:20:00,357 --> 01:20:01,357
- Hey...
- No...

1292
01:20:01,866 --> 01:20:02,866
No...

1293
01:20:03,546 --> 01:20:05,179
Oh no!

1294
01:20:06,121 --> 01:20:07,121
VUDA PARK

1295
01:20:09,118 --> 01:20:10,323
Oh no!

1296
01:20:17,972 --> 01:20:20,147
You might have been bad in the
eyes of people for killing him,

1297
01:20:20,171 --> 01:20:21,399
but you've become God for me.

1298
01:20:22,941 --> 01:20:24,349
Next time,
when I murder someone,

1299
01:20:24,594 --> 01:20:26,579
I'll also kill the guy
who is under his leg.

1300
01:20:29,022 --> 01:20:30,022
Sahasra, come.

1301
01:20:30,353 --> 01:20:32,526
Ganesh, I've booked two
tickets to Bangalore.

1302
01:20:32,670 --> 01:20:34,910
Leave this city before
Bairagi discovers this.

1303
01:20:35,020 --> 01:20:36,060
Book tickets for them too.

1304
01:20:37,705 --> 01:20:38,705
Brother.

1305
01:20:47,319 --> 01:20:48,633
I and your sister are in love.

1306
01:20:49,669 --> 01:20:50,757
We wanted to get eloped.

1307
01:20:51,774 --> 01:20:52,774
Stop us if you can.

1308
01:20:54,722 --> 01:20:56,402
You thought I would
say these words, right?

1309
01:20:57,057 --> 01:20:59,119
I came to know last night
that she is your sister.

1310
01:20:59,436 --> 01:21:03,744
I put my love aside immediately
and erased all my memories of her.

1311
01:21:04,678 --> 01:21:07,414
I love you more than your sister.

1312
01:21:09,679 --> 01:21:11,279
Didn't you understand yet?

1313
01:21:11,871 --> 01:21:13,918
I sacrificed my love for you.

1314
01:21:15,359 --> 01:21:17,619
Love is nothing to me.
It is you who I care about.

1315
01:21:18,732 --> 01:21:20,221
From now, your life is my life.

1316
01:21:20,565 --> 01:21:22,132
I'll be showing you gratitude.

1317
01:21:22,543 --> 01:21:26,052
A for all. B for Bairagi.

1318
01:21:26,260 --> 01:21:27,820
C for caught glimpse of Bairagi by all.

1319
01:21:31,110 --> 01:21:34,612
Bairagi, who didn't show up since 15 years

1320
01:21:34,619 --> 01:21:38,179
came out suddenly and roamed
around entire city with his men.

1321
01:21:38,390 --> 01:21:40,439
- People thronged to see Bairagi.
- Hey!

1322
01:21:40,785 --> 01:21:41,885
Hey Bairagi.

1323
01:21:42,285 --> 01:21:44,943
Why did Bairagi show up all of a sudden
who has been seen all these years?

1324
01:21:44,967 --> 01:21:46,398
- I'll kill you.
- Hey...

1325
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:47,840
Would you break the TV?

1326
01:21:47,991 --> 01:21:49,946
We don't have a budget for your
hospital bill. And you want to break TV?

1327
01:21:49,970 --> 01:21:50,481
Let go of this.

1328
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:52,594
I won't spare him.
I'll kill him.

1329
01:21:52,661 --> 01:21:55,727
If you want to kill him,
you have to kill Ganesh first.

1330
01:21:56,102 --> 01:21:58,327
Bairagi was saved because of that idiot.

1331
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:01,855
I'll kill both of them this time.

1332
01:22:01,939 --> 01:22:03,272
Try to switch on the fan.

1333
01:22:04,915 --> 01:22:06,326
Do it for me.

1334
01:22:10,094 --> 01:22:13,015
You can even switch on this fan
and you wanted to kill Bairagi's fan.

1335
01:22:13,230 --> 01:22:14,407
How can you even kill him?

1336
01:22:15,220 --> 01:22:16,494
Shut up and take this tablet.

1337
01:22:16,864 --> 01:22:19,452
Their death is in my hands.

1338
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:27,939
This is known as a photo getting viral.

1339
01:22:29,568 --> 01:22:32,358
You used to be invisible like a satellite,

1340
01:22:32,596 --> 01:22:35,276
but you came to roads and seen by
everyone like a street light, sir.

1341
01:22:36,967 --> 01:22:37,967
Oh!

1342
01:22:39,078 --> 01:22:42,729
Sir, the street became
silent when you showed up.

1343
01:22:42,904 --> 01:22:44,720
There aren't any
birds or people over here.

1344
01:22:44,875 --> 01:22:49,535
But there is a crow, which means there
is some link between you and the crow.

1345
01:22:50,578 --> 01:22:52,494
Crow is the vehicle of Lord Shani, sir.

1346
01:22:52,794 --> 01:22:55,121
If it is here,
it would be followed by him.

1347
01:22:55,603 --> 01:22:58,308
Bairagi came into light and roaming around
the city, but why didn't you nab him yet?

1348
01:22:58,332 --> 01:22:59,912
Can you really nab him?

1349
01:23:00,193 --> 01:23:02,913
In order to nab him, a special
police officer is arriving from Delhi.

1350
01:23:03,656 --> 01:23:04,656
His name is Kattappa.

1351
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:07,440
And he seems like a
tiger in the police uniform.

1352
01:23:08,647 --> 01:23:09,847
When he enters into the scene,

1353
01:23:09,937 --> 01:23:11,697
there wouldn't be any
comments except action.

1354
01:23:26,355 --> 01:23:27,355
Bairagi!

1355
01:23:29,201 --> 01:23:32,121
There would be silence only until the
lion finds the location of the deer.

1356
01:23:32,213 --> 01:23:34,453
Once it finds its location,
there would be just violence.

1357
01:23:35,299 --> 01:23:38,806
If I start firing, there wouldn't be any
space in the graveyard for cremation.

1358
01:23:39,556 --> 01:23:41,976
I've already did 999 encounters.

1359
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:44,800
Why the hell is he stating that
as if it is some price of an item?

1360
01:23:47,481 --> 01:23:49,886
If his words are counter to me
and then my action is an encounter.

1361
01:23:49,910 --> 01:23:51,710
When I'm on the field,
you should remain calm.

1362
01:23:51,739 --> 01:23:54,013
Otherwise, there won't any
mercy. You'll see my rage.

1363
01:23:54,672 --> 01:23:58,773
If I enter into a scene, the writer
of the dialogues would be dumbstruck.

1364
01:23:58,859 --> 01:23:59,859
I'll crush you.

1365
01:24:00,162 --> 01:24:01,162
You are under arrest.

1366
01:24:02,893 --> 01:24:05,698
I'm not easy going.
This is Katappa here, remember my name.

1367
01:24:06,198 --> 01:24:07,484
Ferocious Kattappa.

1368
01:24:07,748 --> 01:24:09,090
Look Siddhappa,

1369
01:24:10,835 --> 01:24:13,710
A lion has temper
and you have a cap.

1370
01:24:13,807 --> 01:24:16,568
That's the only difference. And the
rest of the features are the same.

1371
01:24:16,646 --> 01:24:17,800
- Ah!
- Uh!

1372
01:24:17,979 --> 01:24:19,459
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm a major.

1373
01:24:20,167 --> 01:24:20,703
Jai Hind.

1374
01:24:21,088 --> 01:24:22,128
What's with your reaction?

1375
01:24:22,366 --> 01:24:23,975
Anyone who crosses 18 years of
age is considered as major, right?

1376
01:24:23,999 --> 01:24:26,327
But we thought it as
rank in the military. Yeah!

1377
01:24:26,330 --> 01:24:28,570
You've been considering all
the things in that way. Yeah!

1378
01:24:28,935 --> 01:24:30,719
You've been mistaking a lady for a fraud,

1379
01:24:30,879 --> 01:24:32,177
and a braveman as killer.

1380
01:24:32,269 --> 01:24:33,269
Blame your job.

1381
01:24:33,488 --> 01:24:35,380
Don't confuse.
Try to convince me.

1382
01:24:35,452 --> 01:24:37,788
Do you have any evidence that
it proves him to be Bairagi?

1383
01:24:37,988 --> 01:24:40,395
His posters are all over the city, right?

1384
01:24:41,449 --> 01:24:41,973
Is it?

1385
01:24:42,465 --> 01:24:45,633
Would my photo on 'Atharintiki Daaredi'
movie poster makes me Pawan Kalyan?

1386
01:24:45,842 --> 01:24:47,453
Well, it is logical.

1387
01:24:47,988 --> 01:24:48,702
Then, who is he?

1388
01:24:48,961 --> 01:24:49,961
Bhairraju.

1389
01:24:51,170 --> 01:24:53,591
He is from Annavaram,
settled in Simhachalam.

1390
01:24:53,656 --> 01:24:54,120
What?

1391
01:24:54,497 --> 01:24:55,500
This is his aadhar card,

1392
01:24:57,013 --> 01:24:58,013
voter card,

1393
01:24:58,491 --> 01:24:59,491
pan card.

1394
01:25:00,258 --> 01:25:02,211
Oh crap! He is really Bhairraju.

1395
01:25:03,478 --> 01:25:06,570
There is CC recording that
thugs are going along with him.

1396
01:25:06,666 --> 01:25:08,218
No one can erase those recordings.

1397
01:25:08,314 --> 01:25:10,200
They aren't thugs, sir.
They are his relatives.

1398
01:25:10,394 --> 01:25:11,533
He has a joint family.

1399
01:25:13,403 --> 01:25:16,443
Mother, father, elder sister, younger
sister, elder brother, younger brother,

1400
01:25:16,513 --> 01:25:18,909
paternal aunt, paternal uncle,
maternal aunt, maternal uncle,

1401
01:25:18,933 --> 01:25:20,192
brother-in-law and
wife's younger brother.

1402
01:25:20,216 --> 01:25:22,761
He has a great family where they
have all these family members.

1403
01:25:22,982 --> 01:25:26,022
It is rather termed as colony but not
family when there are a lot of members.

1404
01:25:26,414 --> 01:25:28,335
It is fantastic when the last pun is mine.

1405
01:25:28,565 --> 01:25:29,629
Show his family.

1406
01:25:29,799 --> 01:25:30,897
If they are really his family
members, they'll be at his home.

1407
01:25:30,921 --> 01:25:32,721
Otherwise,
you'll find them on railway tracks.

1408
01:25:32,860 --> 01:25:34,260
I'll make the train move over them.

1409
01:25:38,270 --> 01:25:40,046
BHAIRRAJU BRUNDAVANAM

1410
01:25:40,752 --> 01:25:42,996
Sir, this is his house.
Bhairraju Brundavanam.

1411
01:25:43,906 --> 01:25:45,874
How come a wrench handler
has such a posh house?

1412
01:25:45,995 --> 01:25:48,895
He handles wrench work during
daytime and real-estate at nights.

1413
01:25:49,061 --> 01:25:53,253
If I don't find his family inside, I'll
make him run till Bheemili kicking him.

1414
01:25:54,238 --> 01:25:57,078
I will decide it right now whether
he is Bhairraju or Bairagi. Let's go.

1415
01:25:59,646 --> 01:26:03,293
- Hail Lord Balaji.
- Hail Lord Balaji.

1416
01:26:03,586 --> 01:26:09,581
"Lachhamma song
from the movie Ishq."

1417
01:26:11,233 --> 01:26:12,314
- Hey!
- Oh no!

1418
01:26:12,955 --> 01:26:13,958
Stop you baritone music.

1419
01:26:14,328 --> 01:26:16,234
People would be diseased and
dead if they listen to this.

1420
01:26:16,258 --> 01:26:18,010
- Who the hell are you?
- Sha... Shankarabharanam, sir.

1421
01:26:18,022 --> 01:26:20,966
He looks like cheap thug.
How can he be Shankarabharanam?

1422
01:26:21,112 --> 01:26:22,792
His mother gave birth
to him in the theatre

1423
01:26:22,953 --> 01:26:24,687
when she was watching the
movie Shankarabharanam.

1424
01:26:24,711 --> 01:26:25,335
Who are they?

1425
01:26:25,606 --> 01:26:26,722
They are poets, sir.

1426
01:26:27,014 --> 01:26:28,717
Kannaihya, Thikkanna and Yerrapragada.

1427
01:26:28,855 --> 01:26:31,375
They seem like agricultural land
leasees, how can they be poets?

1428
01:26:31,990 --> 01:26:34,696
They might look ugly but they
hail from great scholars family.

1429
01:26:34,827 --> 01:26:37,079
They look like marauders.
How can they be scholars?

1430
01:26:37,238 --> 01:26:38,389
Oh man! Why is he not believing?

1431
01:26:38,413 --> 01:26:39,413
Hey wait!

1432
01:26:39,768 --> 01:26:41,878
You seem like a rogue wearing
a suit! Where are you going?

1433
01:26:41,902 --> 01:26:43,710
- Office, sir?
- Municipal office?

1434
01:26:43,716 --> 01:26:46,679
- No, software office.
- How come you are having a dirty beard?

1435
01:26:46,930 --> 01:26:48,850
This is a style from the
movie 'Nannaku Prematho'

1436
01:26:49,426 --> 01:26:50,426
Ah!

1437
01:26:50,553 --> 01:26:51,577
Sir, he is a doctor.

1438
01:26:52,396 --> 01:26:55,125
Sir, I'm Dr Manohar
Naidu, the numerologist.

1439
01:26:55,491 --> 01:26:59,131
He means neurologist. It
was the slip of his tongue.

1440
01:26:59,194 --> 01:27:00,461
- Go away.
- Hello.

1441
01:27:00,650 --> 01:27:02,614
How can a ball go out of a
stadium if a wall is built around?

1442
01:27:02,638 --> 01:27:03,958
- Sir, they are...
- I understood.

1443
01:27:04,848 --> 01:27:06,232
They are cricketers and engineers.

1444
01:27:06,421 --> 01:27:07,140
What's this combination?

1445
01:27:07,324 --> 01:27:09,460
Oh! They were discussing
about cricket stadium.

1446
01:27:09,621 --> 01:27:14,399
Sir, Bhairraju became a mechanic in order
to make them as mechanical engineers.

1447
01:27:14,498 --> 01:27:14,917
Yes.

1448
01:27:15,434 --> 01:27:17,222
Get to work.
All the idiots are in this house.

1449
01:27:17,246 --> 01:27:19,221
Are there any woman in this house or
is it just freaking men living here?

1450
01:27:19,245 --> 01:27:21,053
Woman don't go out the house.

1451
01:27:21,253 --> 01:27:22,268
They are orthodox.

1452
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:24,434
If they are orthodox, I'm Mad Max.

1453
01:27:25,215 --> 01:27:27,231
- Oh no!
- Oh no!

1454
01:27:29,027 --> 01:27:30,579
We're family women.

1455
01:27:30,636 --> 01:27:31,295
Did I ask?

1456
01:27:31,386 --> 01:27:33,146
They got panicked at
the sight of the police.

1457
01:27:50,856 --> 01:27:54,441
Why is she doing that
ritual as if he won an IPL cup?

1458
01:27:54,509 --> 01:27:58,417
As her brother came home, she is doing
a cleansing ritual to take him inside.

1459
01:27:58,637 --> 01:28:01,719
He looks like Bin Laden and his sister is
like the princess of the United Kingdom,

1460
01:28:01,743 --> 01:28:02,845
What's this combination?

1461
01:28:03,798 --> 01:28:04,439
Let's go.

1462
01:28:04,567 --> 01:28:06,728
Step in with your right foot, brother.

1463
01:28:06,933 --> 01:28:09,817
A neuron in his brain got
disconnected due to Bairagi's slap.

1464
01:28:09,918 --> 01:28:13,250
Even he doesn't know when
it connects or disconnects.

1465
01:28:13,394 --> 01:28:14,103
"Bhale Bhale Magadivoy
song from Bhale Bhale Magadivoy movie."

1466
01:28:14,303 --> 01:28:16,806
Who is he? Why am I here?

1467
01:28:23,979 --> 01:28:26,780
I'm Kungfu Pandu, right? Oh
my freaking veg manchurian!

1468
01:28:28,499 --> 01:28:29,073
Who are they?

1469
01:28:29,326 --> 01:28:30,427
They are his parents.

1470
01:28:31,204 --> 01:28:31,636
What about them?

1471
01:28:32,021 --> 01:28:33,235
- They are his big mother and big father.
- It's us.

1472
01:28:33,247 --> 01:28:33,697
What does that mean?

1473
01:28:33,974 --> 01:28:35,774
It means they are his
paternal aunt and uncle.

1474
01:28:35,982 --> 01:28:37,662
They are his small
mother and small father.

1475
01:28:37,717 --> 01:28:39,521
It means they are his another
set of paternal aunt and uncle.

1476
01:28:39,545 --> 01:28:40,433
Wow! You got it correct.

1477
01:28:40,533 --> 01:28:42,013
It is you who illustrated it clearly.

1478
01:28:42,955 --> 01:28:45,287
Why is he standing beside him all the time

1479
01:28:45,463 --> 01:28:47,223
as if a transmission
tower beside a hoarding?

1480
01:28:47,530 --> 01:28:50,510
He is Nalla Swamy and he is
like Lord Hanuman to Bhairraju.

1481
01:28:50,552 --> 01:28:51,068
What about him?

1482
01:28:51,127 --> 01:28:53,341
Him?
He is Kallu Swamy, son of Nalla Swamy.

1483
01:28:54,108 --> 01:28:56,509
Why did all these relatives come here?

1484
01:28:57,152 --> 01:28:58,427
- To attend a wedding.
- Whose wedding?

1485
01:28:58,451 --> 01:28:58,884
Bhairraju's wedding.

1486
01:28:59,282 --> 01:29:00,295
Wedding?

1487
01:29:00,423 --> 01:29:01,511
My wedding?

1488
01:29:01,771 --> 01:29:03,971
- Would any girl marry him?
- Shall I kick him, brother?

1489
01:29:04,626 --> 01:29:06,191
What's he saying?

1490
01:29:06,679 --> 01:29:10,391
He asked, "Shall I switch on AC?"

1491
01:29:10,616 --> 01:29:12,854
- He saw you sweat, so he is concerned.
- Okay.

1492
01:29:13,219 --> 01:29:16,255
Hey, you managed everyone
like an event manager.

1493
01:29:16,547 --> 01:29:18,347
But what's your relation
with the people here?

1494
01:29:19,664 --> 01:29:20,734
Say something and manage...

1495
01:29:20,758 --> 01:29:21,758
My fiance, sir.

1496
01:29:25,690 --> 01:29:29,041
Why is she feeling shy? Is she your lover?

1497
01:29:29,385 --> 01:29:30,385
Yes...

1498
01:29:31,061 --> 01:29:31,578
No...

1499
01:29:31,927 --> 01:29:32,927
No!

1500
01:29:34,678 --> 01:29:35,678
Master?

1501
01:29:35,803 --> 01:29:36,883
Move aside... Move aside...

1502
01:29:37,098 --> 01:29:38,890
No one are related here.

1503
01:29:39,346 --> 01:29:41,077
Who the hell is he talking nonsense?

1504
01:29:41,337 --> 01:29:42,166
He is their servant.

1505
01:29:42,340 --> 01:29:44,958
Servant? You'll be finished
if I start speaking.

1506
01:29:45,884 --> 01:29:47,529
Ask me whatever information
you want, I'll tell you.

1507
01:29:47,553 --> 01:29:48,338
- Get down first.
- Okay.

1508
01:29:48,498 --> 01:29:50,115
This short guy seems
like he would make a mess.

1509
01:29:50,139 --> 01:29:51,939
- What I'm about to say is...
- Sir, have tea.

1510
01:29:53,183 --> 01:29:54,783
Let me clearly explain after having tea.

1511
01:29:56,503 --> 01:29:58,433
- What kind of tea is this?
- Ginger tea, sir.

1512
01:29:58,603 --> 01:30:00,141
Tastes like jaggery tea. Have it, sir.

1513
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:02,245
Do you even know how to make tea?

1514
01:30:02,654 --> 01:30:04,614
Bring a half liter of milk
and start heating them.

1515
01:30:04,937 --> 01:30:08,450
Put some Chakra Gold tea powder,
add sugar and boil it well.

1516
01:30:08,650 --> 01:30:12,628
Then place a small ginger piece
in it and them drink it hot...

1517
01:30:12,828 --> 01:30:14,353
You'll feel on the top of the world.

1518
01:30:14,751 --> 01:30:15,751
Huh?

1519
01:30:15,821 --> 01:30:17,600
Well,
you just said you would reveal some truth?

1520
01:30:17,624 --> 01:30:18,419
Er...

1521
01:30:18,619 --> 01:30:21,192
Oh that? Truth can't be hidden,
truth always comes out.

1522
01:30:21,613 --> 01:30:22,204
Eh?

1523
01:30:22,404 --> 01:30:24,181
Not that,
you said you'd tell us a truth?

1524
01:30:24,381 --> 01:30:25,601
Er...

1525
01:30:26,703 --> 01:30:27,776
Oh that!

1526
01:30:27,976 --> 01:30:29,576
It was about tea, I've told him clearly.

1527
01:30:29,952 --> 01:30:30,557
Huh?

1528
01:30:30,757 --> 01:30:31,837
- You!
- Oh god!

1529
01:30:33,086 --> 01:30:35,735
Rail engine and fire engine have
their own distinguished sounds.

1530
01:30:36,149 --> 01:30:37,867
The sound of me hitting is the same!

1531
01:30:38,064 --> 01:30:40,293
- Do you know who I am?
- Don't you know it yourself?

1532
01:30:40,506 --> 01:30:42,266
- Who the hell is he?
- He is our master sir.

1533
01:30:42,419 --> 01:30:43,476
- What master?
- Er...

1534
01:30:43,676 --> 01:30:44,327
Tea master.

1535
01:30:44,527 --> 01:30:46,290
Why would a tea master
talk rubbish like this?

1536
01:30:46,314 --> 01:30:48,911
- Actually he slipped and fell down.
- Why would he like rubbish if he slipped?

1537
01:30:48,935 --> 01:30:50,359
Actually, he slipped in the third floor.

1538
01:30:50,383 --> 01:30:51,503
Then his actions are reasonable.

1539
01:30:51,527 --> 01:30:53,607
As I'm a tea master,
let me bring a nice tea for you.

1540
01:30:53,728 --> 01:30:54,728
- Hey.
- What man?

1541
01:30:54,772 --> 01:30:55,976
Hell with your antics. Get lost!

1542
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,280
Yeah, guy with a fake moustache.

1543
01:30:57,335 --> 01:30:59,249
Are you convinced now sir?

1544
01:31:00,097 --> 01:31:02,457
Is it clear now that this guy
isn't Bairagi but is Bairraju?

1545
01:31:02,796 --> 01:31:04,154
- You can start now.
- Hmm...

1546
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:06,320
I'm not leaving because you asked you to.

1547
01:31:06,455 --> 01:31:08,135
I'll have to leave now
if I have to return.

1548
01:31:08,412 --> 01:31:09,469
That's why I'm leaving.

1549
01:31:09,923 --> 01:31:11,871
I'll return. I'll come back soon.

1550
01:31:12,505 --> 01:31:15,204
If I even get a small clue
that he is Bairagi himself...

1551
01:31:15,591 --> 01:31:18,525
I'll make you all stand in a queue
and finish you with a single bullet.

1552
01:31:19,014 --> 01:31:21,021
Lion-hearted! Yeah!

1553
01:31:21,586 --> 01:31:23,674
Let's go sir. Move aside you moron!

1554
01:31:24,604 --> 01:31:25,641
Bro...

1555
01:31:26,393 --> 01:31:29,073
Do you think I've done all of this
as I was scared of that Kattappa?

1556
01:31:29,469 --> 01:31:31,365
I didn't like you staying
alone somewhere bro.

1557
01:31:31,730 --> 01:31:33,487
So, I set a family for you.

1558
01:31:39,639 --> 01:31:41,639
- Grandma is going somewhere...
- Come here Ganesh.

1559
01:31:45,125 --> 01:31:46,215
Thanks dude.

1560
01:31:46,438 --> 01:31:47,438
Er... but why?

1561
01:31:47,595 --> 01:31:50,584
You changed my brother who never
likes home into a family man.

1562
01:31:51,065 --> 01:31:52,410
I'm so happy now.

1563
01:31:52,917 --> 01:31:54,260
Do I give you a good treat?

1564
01:31:54,615 --> 01:31:55,683
And what's that?

1565
01:31:57,105 --> 01:31:57,827
Er...

1566
01:31:58,027 --> 01:32:00,796
I thought you meant some
fruit or sweet by treat.

1567
01:32:01,293 --> 01:32:02,294
You gave such a hot one!

1568
01:32:02,494 --> 01:32:04,689
- What happens if someone notices?
- Our wedding.

1569
01:32:04,889 --> 01:32:06,948
Oh,
but I've announced our break up already!

1570
01:32:07,418 --> 01:32:09,164
When you're in love lock-up...

1571
01:32:10,766 --> 01:32:12,083
There is no break up.

1572
01:32:12,283 --> 01:32:13,283
Huh!

1573
01:32:36,561 --> 01:32:38,925
"In the tonnes of your beauty."

1574
01:32:39,807 --> 01:32:43,551
"Oh my dear girl,
I'm drenched in moonlight."

1575
01:32:46,053 --> 01:32:48,144
"With roses..."

1576
01:32:49,348 --> 01:32:52,782
"Are you the arrow that
pierces into my life."

1577
01:32:55,529 --> 01:32:59,716
"I've got to see you and
I have to stay with you."

1578
01:33:00,324 --> 01:33:04,739
"Says my inner self
regardless of what people say."

1579
01:33:05,063 --> 01:33:07,241
"In the tonnes of your beauty."

1580
01:33:08,341 --> 01:33:11,884
"Oh my dear girl,
I'm drenched in moonlight."

1581
01:33:14,565 --> 01:33:16,920
"I watch you daily."

1582
01:33:17,796 --> 01:33:21,457
"I like seeing you in the mirror."

1583
01:33:52,902 --> 01:33:54,717
"I'll take you away."

1584
01:33:55,309 --> 01:33:57,168
"I'll embrace you."

1585
01:33:57,699 --> 01:34:01,312
"I'll hide you in me."

1586
01:34:01,876 --> 01:34:04,327
"I'm looking at myself."

1587
01:34:04,830 --> 01:34:06,720
"I'm comparing with you."

1588
01:34:07,172 --> 01:34:10,924
"Am I in my senses too?"

1589
01:34:11,441 --> 01:34:13,776
"Even when the distances
are dragging us apart."

1590
01:34:14,300 --> 01:34:16,149
"I'm stepping towards you"

1591
01:34:16,394 --> 01:34:20,505
"I've got to reach you,
I have to live for you."

1592
01:34:21,148 --> 01:34:25,620
"I'm a slave of your love forever."

1593
01:34:59,401 --> 01:35:01,381
"I'll fly in the skies."

1594
01:35:01,846 --> 01:35:03,817
"I'll win all the stars."

1595
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:08,009
"It's enough if you just be with me."

1596
01:35:08,380 --> 01:35:10,870
"Let me check the depths of love."

1597
01:35:11,366 --> 01:35:13,342
"I'll stop the pace of age"

1598
01:35:13,730 --> 01:35:17,783
"I wish to be paired
with you for lifetime."

1599
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:20,433
"Am I the sixth ocean"

1600
01:35:20,796 --> 01:35:22,689
"I'll change into some season"

1601
01:35:22,889 --> 01:35:27,040
"I've got to see you and
I have to stay with you."

1602
01:35:27,718 --> 01:35:32,196
"Says my inner self
regardless of what people say."

1603
01:35:32,396 --> 01:35:34,803
"In the tonnes of your beauty."

1604
01:35:35,747 --> 01:35:39,501
"Oh my dear girl,
I'm drenched in moonlight."

1605
01:35:50,688 --> 01:35:52,465
Why did all of you come
here in the first place?

1606
01:35:52,489 --> 01:35:54,810
Ganesh came to us early
in the morning brother.

1607
01:35:55,088 --> 01:35:56,629
He said he wanted to tell us something.

1608
01:35:56,653 --> 01:35:57,653
What did he say?

1609
01:35:57,795 --> 01:35:59,435
The reason I called all of you here is...

1610
01:35:59,518 --> 01:36:01,053
Bairagi bro asked me to
convey something to you.

1611
01:36:01,077 --> 01:36:02,077
And what is that?

1612
01:36:16,665 --> 01:36:17,882
That's what he said bro.

1613
01:36:18,082 --> 01:36:19,966
- What did he say?
- That's what he said.

1614
01:36:20,443 --> 01:36:21,871
I'm asking you what he said?

1615
01:36:22,365 --> 01:36:24,588
We couldn't hear anything in
that background music bro.

1616
01:36:24,976 --> 01:36:25,976
Huh?

1617
01:36:26,583 --> 01:36:27,703
Then why did you people cry?

1618
01:36:27,901 --> 01:36:30,444
That music had a lot of feel to it.

1619
01:36:31,216 --> 01:36:33,368
Hey!

1620
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:38,170
What's this background music?

1621
01:36:38,640 --> 01:36:39,658
Greetings master!

1622
01:36:39,858 --> 01:36:41,082
How are you Seenu?

1623
01:36:41,282 --> 01:36:42,922
- How are you madam?
- I'm doing good son.

1624
01:36:43,170 --> 01:36:43,843
Have you seen it?

1625
01:36:44,043 --> 01:36:47,776
Our son hasn't come to the station to
pick us up knowing that we were coming,

1626
01:36:47,976 --> 01:36:49,526
- I'm so happy about it.
- Why is that so sir?

1627
01:36:49,550 --> 01:36:50,826
He is in love ain't he?

1628
01:36:52,372 --> 01:36:53,711
He must be busy with the girl.

1629
01:36:53,911 --> 01:36:55,083
It's true that he is busy.

1630
01:36:55,283 --> 01:36:57,151
But it's not with the girl,
it's with Bairagi.

1631
01:36:57,550 --> 01:36:58,372
With Bairagi?

1632
01:36:58,572 --> 01:37:00,816
So... hasn't he forgotten Bairagi yet?

1633
01:37:01,016 --> 01:37:03,256
You've told him a fable in his childhood.

1634
01:37:03,456 --> 01:37:04,843
So he is sticking to it really tight.

1635
01:37:04,867 --> 01:37:08,035
He himself felt that
Bairagi has saved his life...

1636
01:37:08,311 --> 01:37:11,926
And when he was roaming
around to help him in any way

1637
01:37:12,126 --> 01:37:14,952
I was scared and got
transferred to Bhadrachalam!

1638
01:37:15,152 --> 01:37:19,437
I didn't expect that he'd remember
him even after all these years.

1639
01:37:19,637 --> 01:37:21,877
Well you should expect that.
That's how his character is!

1640
01:37:21,972 --> 01:37:25,173
Bairagi... this is the hot
topic in the entire Vizag city today.

1641
01:37:25,730 --> 01:37:29,926
Some people say he is Bairagi,
while some say it's a publicity stunt.

1642
01:37:30,438 --> 01:37:31,506
If he is Bairagi...

1643
01:37:31,706 --> 01:37:33,626
Tune in to E TV,
it's time for Abhishekam serial.

1644
01:37:33,767 --> 01:37:35,241
Tune in to MAA TV,
it's time for Seethamalakshmi serial.

1645
01:37:35,265 --> 01:37:37,494
Hey! Tune in to Zee Telugu,
it's time for Muddamandaaram serial.

1646
01:37:37,518 --> 01:37:38,518
- Hey!
- Tune in now!

1647
01:37:38,681 --> 01:37:39,753
Grab the remote from him!

1648
01:37:40,842 --> 01:37:44,342
- Uncle, can you pull the shorts down?
- Get lost!

1649
01:37:44,542 --> 01:37:45,688
Please uncle!

1650
01:37:47,093 --> 01:37:48,159
Hey!

1651
01:37:48,928 --> 01:37:50,022
- Nalla Swamy!
- Hey move...

1652
01:37:50,222 --> 01:37:52,918
- Tell me Bairagi.
- Send everyone away immediately.

1653
01:37:53,530 --> 01:37:54,536
Else kill them all.

1654
01:37:55,699 --> 01:37:56,950
We have to bear this Bairagi.

1655
01:37:57,457 --> 01:38:01,200
If Kattappa confirms you as Bairagi,
all our toil till now would go waste.

1656
01:38:05,526 --> 01:38:06,526
Hey!

1657
01:38:06,572 --> 01:38:08,732
It's you who got him out and
introduced him as Bairagi.

1658
01:38:08,819 --> 01:38:12,179
And it's you who said he isn't Bairagi but
Bairraju and introduced him to the family.

1659
01:38:12,234 --> 01:38:13,774
What else do you have in plan for him?

1660
01:38:14,223 --> 01:38:15,400
I'll tell you...

1661
01:38:15,789 --> 01:38:16,789
Huh?

1662
01:38:22,557 --> 01:38:23,557
Oh my!

1663
01:38:23,829 --> 01:38:26,726
A tiger won't eat the dishes you cooked
for it. It simply munches on the feeder.

1664
01:38:26,750 --> 01:38:27,328
Huh?

1665
01:38:27,528 --> 01:38:29,728
- Why are you doing this firstly?
- For my satisfaction.

1666
01:38:29,802 --> 01:38:30,802
Hey you!

1667
01:38:30,982 --> 01:38:33,952
- Your satisfaction is life taking!
- Oh!

1668
01:38:34,251 --> 01:38:35,530
Hey. Stop this here.

1669
01:38:35,730 --> 01:38:36,809
Listen to me!

1670
01:38:37,009 --> 01:38:38,845
Hey you! I've heard your secret!

1671
01:38:39,137 --> 01:38:39,798
- Oh god!
- Huh?

1672
01:38:39,998 --> 01:38:41,798
You planned so much
while looking so innocent!

1673
01:38:41,986 --> 01:38:44,763
If I tell this to Bairagi,
he'll kill you.

1674
01:38:45,032 --> 01:38:46,152
I'll let him know right now.

1675
01:38:48,247 --> 01:38:50,259
Ganesh is playing games with your life...

1676
01:38:50,752 --> 01:38:53,010
- Shame on you! You're playing with kids.
- Hey!

1677
01:38:53,148 --> 01:38:54,960
Hey mad man, what are you doing here?
Get lost!

1678
01:38:54,984 --> 01:38:56,424
Hey chap. Stop your crap.

1679
01:38:56,594 --> 01:38:58,902
Do you know what Ganesh plans for you?

1680
01:38:59,102 --> 01:39:00,348
What is he planning?

1681
01:39:00,548 --> 01:39:02,372
Er...

1682
01:39:03,148 --> 01:39:05,443
This ringtone reminds me that I'm a man.

1683
01:39:05,658 --> 01:39:06,672
Just wait for a minute.

1684
01:39:07,306 --> 01:39:08,494
- Hello?
- Hello...

1685
01:39:08,990 --> 01:39:10,754
We're calling from Manasa Resorts sir.

1686
01:39:11,310 --> 01:39:12,310
Does she look good?

1687
01:39:12,534 --> 01:39:15,134
Manasa isn't the name of a girl sir.
It's the name of our resorts.

1688
01:39:15,348 --> 01:39:16,997
Sorry. Tell me?

1689
01:39:17,797 --> 01:39:19,717
If you visit our resorts,
you'll get free spirits

1690
01:39:19,754 --> 01:39:20,780
along with free starters.

1691
01:39:20,980 --> 01:39:22,747
You'll get a nice massage
along with ladies.

1692
01:39:23,020 --> 01:39:23,635
Really?

1693
01:39:23,835 --> 01:39:26,237
Er... sorry sir.
I meant the ladies do the massage.

1694
01:39:26,437 --> 01:39:28,797
Oh... I'm completely free of work.
Tell me when can I visit?

1695
01:39:28,835 --> 01:39:31,435
You can come when you're in good
mood and can leave when it's off.

1696
01:39:31,771 --> 01:39:33,681
I'm on the way already.
You can disconnect.

1697
01:39:35,034 --> 01:39:36,034
Huh?

1698
01:39:36,471 --> 01:39:38,511
Why are you here bro?
Do you have some work with me?

1699
01:39:40,131 --> 01:39:42,171
It was you who said you
wanted to tell me something!

1700
01:39:42,381 --> 01:39:43,381
Ah!

1701
01:39:43,846 --> 01:39:46,166
They're offering a free body
massage by ladies. Interested?

1702
01:39:46,727 --> 01:39:47,727
What about you?

1703
01:39:47,842 --> 01:39:49,045
Okay guys. I'll leave now.

1704
01:40:00,772 --> 01:40:01,970
Kattapa sir is calling.

1705
01:40:02,350 --> 01:40:03,499
Get up you bull.

1706
01:40:04,051 --> 01:40:05,058
Good morning sir!

1707
01:40:05,258 --> 01:40:07,012
It's just a bad morning once I call.

1708
01:40:07,374 --> 01:40:08,374
Er...

1709
01:40:08,596 --> 01:40:10,716
Even birds stop drinking water
once they hear my name!

1710
01:40:11,048 --> 01:40:13,163
Well they'd just drink
water when they are thirsty.

1711
01:40:13,363 --> 01:40:14,180
Uh...

1712
01:40:14,380 --> 01:40:15,869
Where are you people? At home?

1713
01:40:16,501 --> 01:40:17,637
Maybe you'd want to visit...

1714
01:40:17,837 --> 01:40:19,604
Don't do that.
We're not at home. Am I right?

1715
01:40:20,486 --> 01:40:21,517
Then where are you?

1716
01:40:21,878 --> 01:40:24,690
All our men got up early,
started for a walk...

1717
01:40:25,254 --> 01:40:28,002
Then we started jogging,
and now while talking to you on phone.

1718
01:40:28,202 --> 01:40:29,402
We just entered into a market.

1719
01:40:29,451 --> 01:40:30,274
Which market is it?

1720
01:40:30,474 --> 01:40:33,052
The address is a bit confusing.
It's hard to find the way.

1721
01:40:33,532 --> 01:40:35,923
There are no ways or places
in Vizag that I don't know of.

1722
01:40:36,463 --> 01:40:37,463
Tell me where are you?

1723
01:40:37,647 --> 01:40:40,033
When you travel towards
the east from our house...

1724
01:40:40,569 --> 01:40:42,169
When you take a right turn from there...

1725
01:40:42,263 --> 01:40:44,663
- Do I get to the market you are in?
- It's the China market.

1726
01:40:45,599 --> 01:40:46,679
Take a U-turn there.

1727
01:40:46,879 --> 01:40:49,694
Is it the fish market?
Do you want me to get a 25 kg of them?

1728
01:40:49,992 --> 01:40:51,688
Can vegetarians eat fish sir?

1729
01:40:51,888 --> 01:40:53,541
Oh! He's got me!

1730
01:40:53,741 --> 01:40:54,171
Yeah...

1731
01:40:54,371 --> 01:40:56,325
If you go further and
turn to your right...

1732
01:40:56,640 --> 01:40:58,228
I'd reach the Rythu Bazar
of Seethammadhara.

1733
01:40:58,252 --> 01:41:00,092
You are absolutely right.
You can't come there!

1734
01:41:00,437 --> 01:41:02,072
- It's really long!
- My thong!

1735
01:41:02,569 --> 01:41:03,585
I'm right there.

1736
01:41:03,785 --> 01:41:04,859
Oh!

1737
01:41:05,059 --> 01:41:06,204
So where exactly are you?

1738
01:41:06,404 --> 01:41:10,247
Ah...
we are near the vegetables in Rythu Bazar.

1739
01:41:10,618 --> 01:41:13,000
There are only vegetables in Rythu Bazar.
Not coolers.

1740
01:41:13,425 --> 01:41:14,945
- Where are you?
- Okay Kattappa sir...

1741
01:41:15,217 --> 01:41:16,258
We can see you.

1742
01:41:16,458 --> 01:41:18,338
Be right there and we'll
see you in two minutes.

1743
01:41:18,516 --> 01:41:19,516
Okay? Fine bye.

1744
01:41:19,842 --> 01:41:21,547
We can't be there in two
minutes even if we take a flight.

1745
01:41:21,571 --> 01:41:23,011
So understand how fast we should go!

1746
01:41:23,147 --> 01:41:24,147
Move!

1747
01:41:32,054 --> 01:41:33,653
- Hello Kattapa sir...
- Where are you?

1748
01:41:33,966 --> 01:41:35,286
- We're right at your back.
- Huh?

1749
01:41:35,774 --> 01:41:37,614
- You aren't here!
- Where are you looking sir?

1750
01:41:37,835 --> 01:41:38,543
I'm looking to my front.

1751
01:41:38,743 --> 01:41:41,495
Why are you looking to your front
when we are at your back? Turn back.

1752
01:41:41,519 --> 01:41:42,566
Back? But you are't here!

1753
01:41:42,766 --> 01:41:44,166
Er... where are you looking at now?

1754
01:41:44,283 --> 01:41:45,764
I turned back and am looking to my front.

1755
01:41:45,788 --> 01:41:47,838
You just watch your front always.
Turn back once.

1756
01:41:48,038 --> 01:41:49,083
Hey!

1757
01:41:49,476 --> 01:41:52,087
I'm not a nincompoop. I'm Kattappa.

1758
01:41:52,535 --> 01:41:53,895
Then why don't you look back once?

1759
01:41:55,311 --> 01:41:57,475
Hey! I didn't see you here earlier?

1760
01:41:57,631 --> 01:41:59,231
Earlier you were watching to your front.

1761
01:41:59,559 --> 01:42:00,885
You can see us now as you turned back now.

1762
01:42:00,909 --> 01:42:01,909
Oh...

1763
01:42:01,972 --> 01:42:05,076
Trust us at least by seeing these vegetable
bags sir. We came here for vegetables.

1764
01:42:05,100 --> 01:42:06,620
So many people just to buy vegetables?

1765
01:42:06,825 --> 01:42:10,463
As our's is a united family,
we even buy chilli collectively.

1766
01:42:10,663 --> 01:42:14,651
Hey! It doesn't seem like you are
here to buy but to rob vegetables.

1767
01:42:15,541 --> 01:42:18,701
After you came in, this place looks more
of a goons den than a vegetable market.

1768
01:42:19,064 --> 01:42:20,082
What is this inspector?

1769
01:42:20,360 --> 01:42:21,360
Huh?

1770
01:42:21,825 --> 01:42:23,031
What are you talking?

1771
01:42:23,819 --> 01:42:26,953
Profession by looking at face,
definition of a person by dress.

1772
01:42:27,754 --> 01:42:29,314
Identification by just looking at eyes.

1773
01:42:29,701 --> 01:42:33,032
And justification by just
having a look are wrong ways.

1774
01:42:33,633 --> 01:42:34,086
Oh!

1775
01:42:34,163 --> 01:42:36,963
First, thee should be verification.
The next one is confirmation.

1776
01:42:37,294 --> 01:42:39,086
After that, there should be notification.

1777
01:42:39,349 --> 01:42:42,241
I don't like this kind of confrontation.

1778
01:42:42,669 --> 01:42:44,775
If you are putting me in irritation,

1779
01:42:45,335 --> 01:42:47,479
my anger will become exasperation.

1780
01:42:47,480 --> 01:42:48,968
Stop your over-action.

1781
01:42:49,276 --> 01:42:52,013
I am an ocean.
I have one station.

1782
01:42:52,135 --> 01:42:53,543
That is police station.

1783
01:42:53,751 --> 01:42:55,402
You are in frustation.

1784
01:42:55,943 --> 01:42:56,943
Stop it!

1785
01:42:57,258 --> 01:42:58,650
Look how cruel he seems.

1786
01:42:59,548 --> 01:43:01,007
Do you think he buys vegetables?

1787
01:43:01,072 --> 01:43:04,168
Don't you scold him unnecessarily.
He is as pure as 24 carats gold.

1788
01:43:04,190 --> 01:43:07,230
The name Bairagi itself echoes is like
copper, you can't compare him to gold.

1789
01:43:07,551 --> 01:43:08,629
What are you talking?

1790
01:43:08,892 --> 01:43:09,941
What's there in the name?

1791
01:43:10,437 --> 01:43:13,026
Can the name decide the
qualities of a person?

1792
01:43:13,117 --> 01:43:15,086
How can you even think to
make something out of a name?

1793
01:43:15,110 --> 01:43:18,037
Would there be any
relationship between ship and an ocean?

1794
01:43:18,292 --> 01:43:21,805
Hey, what are you talking?
Is there any meaning for what you said?

1795
01:43:21,833 --> 01:43:22,313
- Yes, sir.
- What is it?

1796
01:43:22,474 --> 01:43:25,538
Do you mean I have to believe that he
is an innocent guy but not a murderer?

1797
01:43:25,648 --> 01:43:27,435
He is so innocent that when
you talk about Bipasha Basu,

1798
01:43:27,459 --> 01:43:29,827
he thinks it to be some kind of bus.

1799
01:43:30,070 --> 01:43:31,013
When you say 'hands up',

1800
01:43:31,073 --> 01:43:33,007
he thinks that to be some kind of
cold drink like 'Thumbs Up' or '7 Up'.

1801
01:43:33,031 --> 01:43:36,380
He knows nothing
about booze except sweets.

1802
01:43:36,524 --> 01:43:41,852
Bhairraju is an amalgamation of
righteousness, modesty and nobility.

1803
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:45,289
Hey, you are covering him
more than news coverage.

1804
01:43:45,764 --> 01:43:48,204
I will prove you right now
whether he is Bairagi or Bhairraju.

1805
01:43:49,229 --> 01:43:53,389
The guy Bairagi, who you wanted to kill
is at Seethammadhara vegetable market.

1806
01:43:53,750 --> 01:43:55,573
Come over.

1807
01:43:59,173 --> 01:44:01,190
Let's slaughter that scoundrel.

1808
01:44:05,716 --> 01:44:06,716
He will be finished now.

1809
01:44:06,916 --> 01:44:10,194
If he fights back,
it proves that he is Bairagi.

1810
01:44:10,493 --> 01:44:11,597
That's his deadlock.

1811
01:44:14,409 --> 01:44:18,673
Don't do it. If you hold the sword,
it will prove that you are Bairagi.

1812
01:44:19,783 --> 01:44:21,091
Hey...

1813
01:44:30,068 --> 01:44:31,068
Hey...

1814
01:44:41,187 --> 01:44:43,902
Sir, why is he running
into our police academy?

1815
01:44:44,062 --> 01:44:47,477
Hey, we are just four policemen.
But in there, there are 400 policemen.

1816
01:44:47,538 --> 01:44:49,356
They will smash him.

1817
01:44:54,933 --> 01:44:57,306
Don't stop, go. Hurry up. Fast.

1818
01:44:57,398 --> 01:44:58,398
Let's go.

1819
01:44:59,982 --> 01:45:00,988
On your mark.

1820
01:45:03,254 --> 01:45:04,254
Come...

1821
01:45:08,423 --> 01:45:12,184
I'll chase you till you're dead.

1822
01:45:20,721 --> 01:45:21,721
Hey...

1823
01:45:41,358 --> 01:45:42,358
Damn!

1824
01:45:50,318 --> 01:45:51,686
Policemen are around us.

1825
01:46:01,863 --> 01:46:02,863
Go for long jump.

1826
01:46:04,526 --> 01:46:05,526
Jump.

1827
01:46:06,591 --> 01:46:07,591
Hey...

1828
01:46:12,639 --> 01:46:13,639
Damn!

1829
01:46:28,222 --> 01:46:29,222
Take him.

1830
01:46:50,986 --> 01:46:52,038
What are you looking at?

1831
01:46:52,811 --> 01:46:56,075
The thing is that we can only look
at painting after becoming a saint.

1832
01:46:56,262 --> 01:46:58,103
Huh! Look well.

1833
01:47:03,850 --> 01:47:07,687
Hey, don't look.
Control your eyes.

1834
01:47:08,220 --> 01:47:09,443
Hold your heart.

1835
01:47:10,307 --> 01:47:12,802
We don't want that. Don't look.

1836
01:47:15,393 --> 01:47:17,493
Why the hell are you opposing yourself

1837
01:47:17,655 --> 01:47:20,412
when that beauty is asking
you to love her, dumbo?

1838
01:47:20,489 --> 01:47:22,394
Why are you looking like me?
Are you my body double?

1839
01:47:22,418 --> 01:47:23,418
Overaction!

1840
01:47:24,310 --> 01:47:27,013
Hey, lakhs of youth would be
standing in a queue in order to flirt her.

1841
01:47:27,014 --> 01:47:28,625
When such a girl is loving you,

1842
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:31,400
why the hell are you
opposing instead of falling for her?

1843
01:47:31,687 --> 01:47:33,611
- Are you mental?
- I'm sentimental.

1844
01:47:33,670 --> 01:47:35,814
- I'm not in love with that girl now.
- Why so?

1845
01:47:36,114 --> 01:47:37,874
- Because she is Bairagi's sister.
- So what?

1846
01:47:38,066 --> 01:47:40,535
- Because he saved my life.
- Bloody life!

1847
01:47:40,695 --> 01:47:43,003
It doesn't matter if you are alive
or dead when you abandon such a girl.

1848
01:47:43,027 --> 01:47:44,027
Whoa!

1849
01:47:45,606 --> 01:47:47,560
Well, I have a goal.

1850
01:47:47,712 --> 01:47:49,772
The girl is having all kinds of
good features. Don't neglect her.

1851
01:47:49,796 --> 01:47:52,756
A moment is enough for
us to lose close people.

1852
01:47:52,820 --> 01:47:55,740
But even, years are not enough for
you to get close to those who you lost.

1853
01:47:55,813 --> 01:47:57,617
I don't think you're right.

1854
01:47:57,879 --> 01:48:00,582
Why the hell are you hesitating to accept
such a star like beauty?

1855
01:48:00,642 --> 01:48:01,642
You'll go to hell.

1856
01:48:02,425 --> 01:48:08,359
If you lose this beauty,
you'll end up with a bad girl.

1857
01:48:09,666 --> 01:48:10,666
- Stop now!
- Ah!

1858
01:48:11,336 --> 01:48:12,336
Why should I stop?

1859
01:48:12,616 --> 01:48:14,212
Umm... I wasn't talking to you.

1860
01:48:14,991 --> 01:48:16,528
Would you accept her or
shall I start my work?

1861
01:48:16,534 --> 01:48:18,303
- You get inside.
- Why should I?

1862
01:48:18,404 --> 01:48:19,404
I wasn't talking to you.

1863
01:48:19,997 --> 01:48:20,997
It is you.

1864
01:48:21,153 --> 01:48:22,153
Huh!

1865
01:48:22,466 --> 01:48:24,495
How can you read the newspaper peacefully

1866
01:48:24,638 --> 01:48:26,575
even after knowing that
he playing with Bairagi?

1867
01:48:26,842 --> 01:48:30,197
Call him, ask him to stop what
he is doing and come here.

1868
01:48:30,225 --> 01:48:31,505
What do you want me to tell him?

1869
01:48:31,676 --> 01:48:33,697
Do you want me to tell him that
the story which I told was wrong?

1870
01:48:33,721 --> 01:48:38,349
When others remembered just the
story, he remembered the moral.

1871
01:48:38,568 --> 01:48:39,188
Oh no!

1872
01:48:39,288 --> 01:48:43,034
As a teacher, I'm very proud
of him for what he is doing.

1873
01:48:43,626 --> 01:48:46,393
We should slaughter Ganesh into pieces.

1874
01:48:46,713 --> 01:48:50,591
People used to tremble
for what would happen,

1875
01:48:50,783 --> 01:48:52,703
the police used to tremble for what I
would do

1876
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:54,768
and run away upon hearing my name.

1877
01:48:55,008 --> 01:48:57,394
But today, I feared for that police,

1878
01:48:57,494 --> 01:49:01,742
I couldn't kill my enemies
and had to escape from them.

1879
01:49:01,998 --> 01:49:05,202
Ganesh entered into my
silent life like a Tsunami.

1880
01:49:05,302 --> 01:49:06,582
You are right, brother. Hold it!

1881
01:49:06,903 --> 01:49:08,805
Now, both of us have connected very well.

1882
01:49:09,096 --> 01:49:11,316
He made my short film by fooling me.

1883
01:49:11,460 --> 01:49:13,388
And he's planning a reality show with you.

1884
01:49:13,420 --> 01:49:15,053
Hey mental, get out!

1885
01:49:15,196 --> 01:49:18,853
I'll go out but if you know what
Ganesh had planned for Bairagi,

1886
01:49:18,897 --> 01:49:19,897
you'll become mental.

1887
01:49:19,938 --> 01:49:20,938
Hey...

1888
01:49:21,029 --> 01:49:22,434
What did he plan?

1889
01:49:22,470 --> 01:49:24,794
Bairagi, is it necessary
to listen to this fool?

1890
01:49:24,851 --> 01:49:26,647
Nalla Swamy, don't you intervene.

1891
01:49:26,691 --> 01:49:29,835
Anyhow, the retired thugs are of
no use except for cracking satires.

1892
01:49:29,997 --> 01:49:31,706
Your would reach good
position in your life

1893
01:49:31,766 --> 01:49:34,326
if you roam with Kungfu masters
like me instead of retired thugs.

1894
01:49:34,900 --> 01:49:35,900
Oh no!

1895
01:49:36,417 --> 01:49:39,789
"Bhale Bhale Magadivoy
song from Bhale Bhale Magadivoy movie."

1896
01:49:40,145 --> 01:49:41,488
Shut up and get soda.

1897
01:49:41,632 --> 01:49:44,532
Soda? I'm not a soda
supplier, I'm a tea-seller.

1898
01:49:44,769 --> 01:49:46,131
He became tea-seller again.

1899
01:49:46,175 --> 01:49:47,372
Alright. Get tea.

1900
01:49:47,732 --> 01:49:48,732
That's good!

1901
01:49:49,723 --> 01:49:50,723
Strong or light?

1902
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:54,316
- Get something.
- Not possible. Be specific.

1903
01:49:54,569 --> 01:49:56,696
- Hey, get the tea.
- Okay.

1904
01:49:56,756 --> 01:50:00,904
Well... I came here to
tell you something, right?

1905
01:50:01,194 --> 01:50:02,379
I remember it now.

1906
01:50:04,647 --> 01:50:06,044
Milk packets are over.

1907
01:50:06,516 --> 01:50:08,499
What? Oh man!

1908
01:50:10,089 --> 01:50:12,218
- Take this. Go, get them.
- Okay.

1909
01:50:13,110 --> 01:50:14,366
Cow milk or buffalo milk.

1910
01:50:15,774 --> 01:50:16,737
- Crap!
- Get any milk.

1911
01:50:16,793 --> 01:50:18,501
The cat milk is right
for you. I'll get it.

1912
01:50:18,675 --> 01:50:20,290
We have to kill Ganesh tonight.

1913
01:50:20,906 --> 01:50:22,970
- Alert all our people.
- Not possible.

1914
01:50:23,905 --> 01:50:25,425
Our men became his servants.

1915
01:50:26,725 --> 01:50:28,519
Then, deploy new gang.

1916
01:50:33,855 --> 01:50:34,855
Oh!

1917
01:50:35,560 --> 01:50:37,897
The Kabaali gang won't
leave Bairagi in peace.

1918
01:50:37,995 --> 01:50:39,755
I have to knock them
before Bairagi wakes up.

1919
01:50:53,419 --> 01:50:55,824
Did you come to kill Bairaji?

1920
01:50:55,899 --> 01:50:57,096
That task is diffcult when I'm there.

1921
01:50:57,120 --> 01:50:58,160
This gap is enough for me.

1922
01:51:02,544 --> 01:51:05,053
My punch has got punctuality.

1923
01:51:05,585 --> 01:51:06,665
It comes at the right time.

1924
01:51:15,500 --> 01:51:18,306
I don't understand whether I'm
fighting well or you're falling well.

1925
01:51:21,782 --> 01:51:22,782
Sir...

1926
01:51:24,182 --> 01:51:26,773
Did you take stairs to reach here?
Well, I send you out in a shortcut.

1927
01:51:26,797 --> 01:51:29,912
Enjoy the anti gravity effect.

1928
01:51:30,168 --> 01:51:30,605
Ouch!

1929
01:51:30,853 --> 01:51:31,853
Hey...

1930
01:51:32,626 --> 01:51:33,153
Oh no!

1931
01:51:33,354 --> 01:51:34,354
Sorry!

1932
01:51:34,504 --> 01:51:37,503
Kabaali's men came again to kill you.

1933
01:51:37,720 --> 01:51:39,681
In order to not to disturb
you, I knocked them silently.

1934
01:51:39,705 --> 01:51:42,554
They came for you, not me.

1935
01:51:42,716 --> 01:51:44,159
It was me who brought them.

1936
01:51:44,187 --> 01:51:45,606
I'll kill you right now. Hey!

1937
01:51:45,850 --> 01:51:46,850
Bairagi...

1938
01:51:48,584 --> 01:51:50,774
Who will save you if I'm dead?

1939
01:51:51,650 --> 01:51:53,314
I'm like your backbone.

1940
01:51:53,442 --> 01:51:55,128
Forget about killing me. Go and sleep.

1941
01:51:55,313 --> 01:51:56,313
Okay?

1942
01:51:59,618 --> 01:52:00,618
Go to sleep!

1943
01:52:05,579 --> 01:52:08,996
He is my backpain, not backbone.

1944
01:52:09,764 --> 01:52:10,999
I'll kill him right now.

1945
01:52:13,031 --> 01:52:14,119
Hey!

1946
01:52:17,571 --> 01:52:21,240
Do you think I'm a voter to
threaten me with a sword? I'm a shooter!

1947
01:52:21,332 --> 01:52:24,080
I understood you're Bairagi
when I saw aggression in your eyes.

1948
01:52:24,323 --> 01:52:26,448
I've been waiting all
these days for this moment.

1949
01:52:26,809 --> 01:52:27,970
Your scene is finished!

1950
01:52:28,305 --> 01:52:29,445
- Police!
- Oh yeah!

1951
01:52:39,890 --> 01:52:42,474
I made your picture with bullets.
Now, I will throw you in jail.

1952
01:52:42,618 --> 01:52:45,578
Happy birthday to you!

1953
01:52:45,882 --> 01:52:49,464
- Happy birthday to you, my dear!
- What's he doing?

1954
01:52:49,988 --> 01:52:50,988
Whose birthday?

1955
01:52:51,450 --> 01:52:53,099
As I know you're weak in English,
we have made it inscribed in Telugu.

1956
01:52:53,122 --> 01:52:54,027
It is Bhairraju's birthday.

1957
01:52:54,103 --> 01:52:55,849
- Birthday?
- True, sir.

1958
01:52:56,057 --> 01:53:01,337
He was born crying on the 7th day
of the 7th month in the year 1977.

1959
01:53:01,425 --> 01:53:03,420
He was a premature baby and
now, he is torturing everybody.

1960
01:53:03,444 --> 01:53:05,131
With a sword in his hand
and aggression in his eyes,

1961
01:53:05,155 --> 01:53:06,995
it seems like he is on
the way to kill someone.

1962
01:53:07,202 --> 01:53:07,893
Ah!

1963
01:53:08,006 --> 01:53:09,695
He is on the way to cut, but not to kill.

1964
01:53:09,765 --> 01:53:11,465
- Do you mean neck?
- No, it is a cake.

1965
01:53:11,521 --> 01:53:13,382
Would anyone use a
big sword to cut a cake?

1966
01:53:13,464 --> 01:53:16,788
As he has got a big family,
we arranged a big cake.

1967
01:53:16,959 --> 01:53:19,451
As it is a big cake,
we've arranged a big sword to cut it.

1968
01:53:19,670 --> 01:53:21,914
You'll give a simple
answer for a big question.

1969
01:53:22,191 --> 01:53:25,060
If I leave you, you'll convince us that
Dawood Ibrahim to be John Abraham.

1970
01:53:25,084 --> 01:53:26,520
Well, it's time to cut the cake.

1971
01:53:26,556 --> 01:53:27,580
Bairagi, cut the cake.

1972
01:53:28,917 --> 01:53:32,854
Why are you staring? You used to
cut the cake every year, right?

1973
01:53:32,984 --> 01:53:33,984
Come on, cut the cake.

1974
01:53:37,639 --> 01:53:40,400
It's your habit to give the first
piece of cake to your sister, right?

1975
01:53:49,332 --> 01:53:51,106
Brother, you forgot the order.

1976
01:53:51,266 --> 01:53:53,629
You used to take blessings from
your parents after that, right?

1977
01:53:53,653 --> 01:53:54,653
Touch their feet.

1978
01:53:58,037 --> 01:53:59,748
May you have a long life.

1979
01:54:03,001 --> 01:54:05,196
Hey, is this sentiment or management?

1980
01:54:05,309 --> 01:54:06,029
It is an arrangement.

1981
01:54:06,260 --> 01:54:08,038
Oh! It is enjoyment, sir.

1982
01:54:08,123 --> 01:54:10,593
Well, give a cake piece to SI too as
he made your picture with bullets.

1983
01:54:10,617 --> 01:54:11,617
Stop it!

1984
01:54:12,110 --> 01:54:14,440
I hate cakes, jokes and him.

1985
01:54:14,936 --> 01:54:16,584
You might have escaped now,

1986
01:54:17,140 --> 01:54:20,643
but I'll keep coming until I nab him.

1987
01:54:20,771 --> 01:54:23,471
He wanna follow... follow you.

1988
01:54:24,027 --> 01:54:26,508
Enough of your reactions. Relax now.

1989
01:54:26,927 --> 01:54:27,943
Go to your places.

1990
01:54:28,950 --> 01:54:30,427
The birthday is fantastic, right?

1991
01:54:33,891 --> 01:54:36,763
Hey, what's with this
freaking birthday celebrations?

1992
01:54:37,091 --> 01:54:41,251
Your body grew enormously but your
brain didn't grow since your kindergarten.

1993
01:54:42,002 --> 01:54:43,626
Do you know what would happen to you?

1994
01:54:43,818 --> 01:54:45,867
Do you at least know what
he's going to do with you?

1995
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:48,304
Do you know who you are?

1996
01:54:48,604 --> 01:54:49,604
Ho!

1997
01:54:53,153 --> 01:54:54,593
- I'm Kungfu Pandu.
- What's my name?

1998
01:54:54,757 --> 01:54:56,217
- Bairagi.
- What's his name?

1999
01:54:56,409 --> 01:54:57,409
Nalla Swamy.

2000
01:54:57,675 --> 01:54:58,779
- What's that?
- A cake.

2001
01:55:00,941 --> 01:55:06,245
"Bhale Bhale Magadivoy
song from Bhale Bhale Magadivoy movie"

2002
01:55:06,445 --> 01:55:08,767
I'll believe whatever
you say now. Speak out!

2003
01:55:11,222 --> 01:55:12,256
Happy birthday to you.

2004
01:55:13,259 --> 01:55:14,905
What can we wish a
birthday boy other than this?

2005
01:55:14,929 --> 01:55:16,152
Wow! Butterscotch cake.

2006
01:55:16,788 --> 01:55:21,344
I planned his death day but
he changed it to my birthday.

2007
01:55:21,788 --> 01:55:23,389
He isn't bothered about my feelings.

2008
01:55:23,834 --> 01:55:25,594
He's just doing what he feels.

2009
01:55:25,670 --> 01:55:27,662
He is showing me hell by laughing.

2010
01:55:28,451 --> 01:55:30,924
He should lose the admiration for me.

2011
01:55:31,208 --> 01:55:32,912
He should develop such a
vengeance that he should try to kill me.

2012
01:55:32,936 --> 01:55:33,958
What I should do to get that?

2013
01:55:33,982 --> 01:55:37,278
For him to develop vengeance on you,
you should knock his attachment.

2014
01:55:38,718 --> 01:55:40,439
Let's kill his parents.

2015
01:56:06,605 --> 01:56:08,162
I'll be late.

2016
01:56:08,446 --> 01:56:12,393
I'm assigned exam invigilation duty
in AVN college in the last moment.

2017
01:56:12,716 --> 01:56:14,498
Come to the college.

2018
01:56:15,033 --> 01:56:16,969
From the college,
we shall go to attend the function.

2019
01:56:16,993 --> 01:56:17,993
Okay?

2020
01:56:53,390 --> 01:56:53,925
Thank God!

2021
01:56:54,409 --> 01:56:56,817
Lord Ganesh, I wrote what I know.

2022
01:56:57,124 --> 01:56:59,004
It is you who has to
write the rest of the exam.

2023
01:57:03,852 --> 01:57:04,522
You have a answers slip, right bro?

2024
01:57:04,813 --> 01:57:07,476
I know that you're sent by
Ganesh. Please give it to me.

2025
01:57:16,128 --> 01:57:17,943
Bro, the time is running out.

2026
01:57:18,219 --> 01:57:21,099
We're writing exam by sitting on the
same bench. Please show the answers.

2027
01:57:24,243 --> 01:57:25,254
You finished your exam so early?

2028
01:57:25,278 --> 01:57:26,750
If not in this March, we can write
compartment exams in September.

2029
01:57:26,774 --> 01:57:27,894
What if I lose my life, sir?

2030
01:57:29,754 --> 01:57:30,187
Oh no!

2031
01:57:30,368 --> 01:57:32,851
Stop writing.
Handover your answer sheets.

2032
01:57:43,125 --> 01:57:45,886
Hey... You wrote the exam, right?

2033
01:57:46,129 --> 01:57:47,129
Where should you go?

2034
01:57:48,334 --> 01:57:51,169
I think the fuel is empty.
I'll drop you, get in.

2035
01:57:54,478 --> 01:57:55,841
Did you write the exam well?

2036
01:57:58,167 --> 01:58:00,207
What's with your stare as
if you're here to kill me?

2037
01:58:01,580 --> 01:58:03,180
Have you been waiting since a long time?

2038
01:58:03,208 --> 01:58:05,699
Oh! Keep going.

2039
01:58:05,851 --> 01:58:08,372
Why are you late?
All the arrangements are done.

2040
01:58:08,596 --> 01:58:11,016
- We have engagement rings with us.
- Why are you worried?

2041
01:58:11,176 --> 01:58:13,021
That's that case...
Driver, pull over.

2042
01:58:14,173 --> 01:58:15,173
Vasantha, get in.

2043
01:58:17,035 --> 01:58:18,035
Get in, carefully.

2044
01:58:18,317 --> 01:58:19,317
Okay.

2045
01:58:20,703 --> 01:58:22,503
Oh, I don't get where to place this.

2046
01:58:22,695 --> 01:58:24,215
Hey, hold this plate.

2047
01:58:24,317 --> 01:58:26,921
As she is an elderly
woman, she's a bit annoying.

2048
01:58:27,445 --> 01:58:28,445
You won't mind, right?

2049
01:58:40,851 --> 01:58:41,961
Why are you here?

2050
01:58:42,170 --> 01:58:46,689
It was me who drove you from the
exam hall till this wedding hall.

2051
01:58:47,550 --> 01:58:49,456
Though you aren't that young,
today is your engagement day.

2052
01:58:49,480 --> 01:58:50,480
Look there.

2053
01:58:50,793 --> 01:58:51,442
GROOM

2054
01:58:51,652 --> 01:58:52,542
WELCOME TO UPPALAPATI'S
FAMILY ENGAGEMENT FUNCTION

2055
01:58:52,672 --> 01:58:53,672
BRIDE

2056
01:58:54,345 --> 01:58:57,618
My parents' got you ready and brought
you here on the behalf of groom's family.

2057
01:58:57,814 --> 01:58:59,194
What the hell do you
mean by my engagement?

2058
01:58:59,218 --> 01:59:01,674
As I don't want your life to get
wasted, I've arranged your engagement.

2059
01:59:01,698 --> 01:59:04,622
Hey! Do you think I would marry just like

2060
01:59:04,905 --> 01:59:07,154
you made me cut the
cake citing my birthday?

2061
01:59:07,466 --> 01:59:08,466
I'll kill you.

2062
01:59:09,014 --> 01:59:10,014
Who would you kill?

2063
01:59:10,378 --> 01:59:11,378
Whoa!

2064
01:59:11,619 --> 01:59:12,619
He wants to kill me, sir.

2065
01:59:12,924 --> 01:59:16,652
He got a dream last night where he got
married and his wife became pregnant.

2066
01:59:16,696 --> 01:59:19,307
He says that he wants to kill me if
I don't get him married by morning.

2067
01:59:19,331 --> 01:59:20,087
Marriage for him?

2068
01:59:20,297 --> 01:59:22,416
When drunkards and
vagrants are getting married,

2069
01:59:22,492 --> 01:59:24,136
what's wrong in this
beast getting married?

2070
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:24,643
Oh!

2071
01:59:24,837 --> 01:59:26,077
Who is the father of the bride?

2072
01:59:27,587 --> 01:59:29,381
- Arrangements are proper, right?
- Yes, sir.

2073
01:59:29,409 --> 01:59:31,191
If you go in this attire,
people don't find you as a groom.

2074
01:59:31,215 --> 01:59:32,647
Instead, they think you
are here for wedding words.

2075
01:59:32,671 --> 01:59:34,151
Let's go after changing our clothing.

2076
01:59:34,395 --> 01:59:36,273
I'll see how this wedding would happen.

2077
01:59:36,331 --> 01:59:38,018
Well, thank you very much.

2078
01:59:38,194 --> 01:59:38,669
What for?

2079
01:59:38,745 --> 01:59:39,788
For saying that you'd closely
monitor the wedding and getting it done.

2080
01:59:39,812 --> 01:59:40,812
Ah!

2081
01:59:41,357 --> 01:59:42,880
Why did he say that?

2082
01:59:43,460 --> 01:59:44,952
We're getting delayed,
where is my son-in-law?

2083
01:59:44,976 --> 01:59:46,028
Look, he is coming.

2084
01:59:47,326 --> 01:59:53,028
"It is Bhairraju brother's
wedding! Hurrah!"

2085
01:59:54,288 --> 01:59:55,443
- Hi, son-in-law.
- Sir.

2086
01:59:55,595 --> 01:59:57,856
- Who are you?
- I'm the CI of this area.

2087
01:59:58,009 --> 02:00:01,478
Then keep an eye on everyone here.

2088
02:00:01,760 --> 02:00:02,160
Yes, sir.

2089
02:00:02,260 --> 02:00:04,158
You have escaped from me
but you got trapped to him.

2090
02:00:04,182 --> 02:00:06,191
Do you know who he is? C. B. I. Cheaf.

2091
02:00:06,428 --> 02:00:07,521
Nippu Nagabhoshanam.

2092
02:00:07,721 --> 02:00:09,441
If you make any
mistake he will stop firing.

2093
02:00:10,696 --> 02:00:13,317
If he a fire brand then I am
a fire engine I will stop him.

2094
02:00:13,517 --> 02:00:14,776
- Mr. Bhairraju.
- Yes?

2095
02:00:15,103 --> 02:00:16,103
This is my family.

2096
02:00:16,202 --> 02:00:17,980
- My brother is not just Bhairraju sir,
- Then?

2097
02:00:18,004 --> 02:00:23,865
Bhairraju BA, MA, MBA,
M. Com, MCA, LLB and LIC.

2098
02:00:24,955 --> 02:00:25,465
LIC?

2099
02:00:25,665 --> 02:00:26,262
Er...

2100
02:00:26,514 --> 02:00:27,582
What is this LIC?

2101
02:00:27,782 --> 02:00:30,924
He earned all this degrees
working hard as a LIC agent.

2102
02:00:31,124 --> 02:00:32,124
- I see.
- Oh!

2103
02:00:34,826 --> 02:00:35,946
- Hi, Bhairraju!
- Come dear.

2104
02:00:36,270 --> 02:00:37,390
My daughter, Bhagya Lakshmi.

2105
02:00:37,465 --> 02:00:38,603
A girl with gun.

2106
02:00:38,828 --> 02:00:41,268
She doesn't know about dating
at all. She only knows shooting.

2107
02:00:42,711 --> 02:00:43,484
- Dad. Dad...
- Yes?

2108
02:00:43,684 --> 02:00:47,334
I like him so much,
I will shoot him for once dad, please.

2109
02:00:47,534 --> 02:00:49,622
You can shoot him after the marriage,
where whould he go?

2110
02:00:49,646 --> 02:00:51,117
Son-in-law would be
staying with us only right?

2111
02:00:51,141 --> 02:00:54,930
Before I take you to the court, I think
she would kill you in the bedroom only.

2112
02:00:56,152 --> 02:00:57,269
See Mr. Bhairraju,

2113
02:00:57,723 --> 02:01:00,556
you look so intellegent
by seeing all your degrees.

2114
02:01:00,795 --> 02:01:03,691
I know about 3rd degree but I don't
have any idea about these degrees.

2115
02:01:04,388 --> 02:01:06,466
But my brother has a good idea about them.

2116
02:01:06,758 --> 02:01:08,921
He is thinking to test your knowledge.

2117
02:01:09,655 --> 02:01:11,476
Er... don't worry brother,

2118
02:01:11,801 --> 02:01:12,921
whatever they might ask you,

2119
02:01:13,017 --> 02:01:18,154
you just have to answer, what, who,
why? Yes or no. I'll take care of rest.

2120
02:01:22,754 --> 02:01:23,303
Okay?

2121
02:01:23,684 --> 02:01:24,684
Don't worry brother.

2122
02:01:24,910 --> 02:01:25,910
Ready?

2123
02:01:27,088 --> 02:01:27,543

2124
02:01:27,743 --> 02:01:30,482
- Who invented steam engine?

2125
02:01:30,838 --> 02:01:33,755
Yes! James Watt is the one who
invented steam engine right?

2126
02:01:33,955 --> 02:01:34,568
Right answer.

02:01:39,156 --> 02:01:41,020
What would be in front of
Fi which provides internet?

2130
02:01:41,044 --> 02:01:42,504
Er... why?

2131
02:01:42,854 --> 02:01:44,220
Yes, right answer.

2132
02:01:44,473 --> 02:01:46,895

2133
02:01:47,200 --> 02:01:48,279
Next question please.

2134
02:01:48,479 --> 02:01:51,195
- What do you call fog in English?

2137
02:01:57,173 --> 02:01:58,404
- Very good.

2138
02:01:58,504 --> 02:01:59,894
- Snow.
- Can you ask some tough questions please.

2139
02:01:59,918 --> 02:02:01,645
Who established Indian Congress?

2140
02:02:02,400 --> 02:02:03,400
Who?

2141
02:02:04,026 --> 02:02:06,346
Indian Congress was established
by W. W.Hume. It's correct.

2142
02:02:07,084 --> 02:02:07,560
Yes!

2143
02:02:07,760 --> 02:02:08,760
Very good.

2144
02:02:08,938 --> 02:02:10,069
He answered greatly.

2145
02:02:10,269 --> 02:02:11,749
Next question please. Please, please.

2146
02:02:11,929 --> 02:02:12,719
What is the symbol for dollor?

2147
02:02:12,919 --> 02:02:14,002
Yes.

2148
02:02:14,202 --> 02:02:16,583
Yes. If you cut letter
S vertically two times,

2149
02:02:16,820 --> 02:02:18,500
that is what dollor is.
Brother was saying.

2150
02:02:18,956 --> 02:02:20,168
Will he cut dollor too?

2151
02:02:20,268 --> 02:02:21,338
- I have a doubt.
- What?

2152
02:02:21,826 --> 02:02:25,037
You have completed all degrees mostrly.
Then why did you left MBBS?

2153
02:02:25,865 --> 02:02:27,754
Er... Brother is afraid of blood.

2154
02:02:29,176 --> 02:02:30,818
The one who does
murders is afraid of blood?

2155
02:02:30,842 --> 02:02:32,869
Now stop it dad,
interview is completed right?

2156
02:02:33,069 --> 02:02:34,322
I will shoot him for once dad.

2157
02:02:34,522 --> 02:02:35,181
- Oh god!
- Oh no!

2158
02:02:35,434 --> 02:02:38,139
Bhagyam,
son-in-law is in point blank dear,

2159
02:02:38,391 --> 02:02:40,513
you can shoot him later.
Cool, cool. Sit down.

2160
02:02:40,917 --> 02:02:43,198
I saw everyone gives blank
cheque to their son-in-law but,

2161
02:02:43,263 --> 02:02:45,325
I am seeing him who asked
to shoot in point blank.

2162
02:02:45,430 --> 02:02:47,510
By seeing all this I think
it's the match fixing sir.

2163
02:02:47,766 --> 02:02:49,366
Marriage is only the match fixing right?

2164
02:02:49,505 --> 02:02:50,745
Er... gernal knowledge is okay.

2165
02:02:50,865 --> 02:02:52,912
Does son-in-law have any
idea of dance and singing?

2166
02:02:53,253 --> 02:02:55,705
Hey, I know Nitya and Sangeet,

2167
02:02:55,905 --> 02:02:58,266
but who is Nitya Sangeet here around?
Is she a new figure?

2168
02:02:58,740 --> 02:02:59,740
Dance and music man.

2169
02:02:59,900 --> 02:03:01,155
Oh! You should ask like that in telugu.

2170
02:03:01,179 --> 02:03:04,699
By the way we are groom side we
should ask, why are you asking?

2171
02:03:04,899 --> 02:03:06,171
Brother how was my punch?

2172
02:03:06,371 --> 02:03:07,438
You gave it like it would.

2173
02:03:07,677 --> 02:03:10,390
We have come to this
stage by taking many steps.

2174
02:03:10,674 --> 02:03:11,803
Can't we do this steps?

2175
02:03:12,078 --> 02:03:14,092

02:03:33,595 --> 02:03:34,606
Hey, stop it! Stop it!

2179
02:03:35,869 --> 02:03:37,549
You all did the step
which is known to you.

2180
02:03:37,603 --> 02:03:39,449
My brother will do a new step.

2181
02:03:39,649 --> 02:03:40,179
Hmm...

2182
02:03:40,563 --> 02:03:41,643
Dancing is not a big thing.

2183
02:03:42,325 --> 02:03:43,325
You are a mechanic right?

2184
02:03:43,705 --> 02:03:47,090
How do you remove bolt with a
wrench while repairing puncher?

2185
02:03:47,550 --> 02:03:48,550
Yes.

2186
02:03:48,703 --> 02:03:50,638
How do you put air

2187
02:03:50,838 --> 02:03:51,868
Yes.

2188
02:03:52,365 --> 02:03:54,630
If you feel itchy in pant lightly?
That's it.

2189
02:03:54,907 --> 02:03:55,907
Mix them all.

2190
02:03:56,081 --> 02:04:02,025
"Naaka Mukka song from the
movie Kadhalil Vizhunthen."

2191
02:04:20,142 --> 02:04:21,988
Hey, dance is for them only?

2192
02:04:22,371 --> 02:04:23,371
Isn't it for us?

2193
02:04:23,481 --> 02:04:27,725
Er... there are many people here
right we will shift the location.

2194
02:04:27,825 --> 02:04:28,825
- Okay!
- Come on.

2195
02:04:32,096 --> 02:04:35,405
"Jakkara... Jakkara... Jakkanna."

2196
02:04:35,788 --> 02:04:38,872
"Jakkara... Jakkara... Jakkanna."

2197
02:04:42,913 --> 02:04:45,836
"Look at the girl,
she is a beauty and her waist is 26."

2198
02:04:46,370 --> 02:04:49,354
"She is cool like
Popsicle, can I keep a kiss?"

2199
02:04:49,554 --> 02:04:52,637
"You are my darling girl."

2200
02:04:52,952 --> 02:04:56,056
"You are my darling girl."

2201
02:04:56,607 --> 02:04:59,570
"The boy is a great and if we
touch him he would get finished."

2202
02:05:00,113 --> 02:05:03,061
"I'll dedicate my beauty to you,
keep rocking it."

2203
02:05:03,261 --> 02:05:06,386
"You are darling guy."

2204
02:05:06,674 --> 02:05:09,804
"You are darling guy."

2205
02:05:10,004 --> 02:05:12,990
"You are an enthralling beauty."

2206
02:05:13,777 --> 02:05:16,452
"This is the young age
which asks for stress."

2207
02:05:16,652 --> 02:05:18,830
"Her shape is super."

2208
02:05:20,686 --> 02:05:22,772
"Like Apple's laptop."

2209
02:05:24,004 --> 02:05:26,145
"This handsome's speed is super,."

2210
02:05:27,460 --> 02:05:29,731
"His pressure is strong as Audi's bumper."

2211
02:05:30,534 --> 02:05:33,843
"Jakkara... Jakkara... Jakkanna."

2212
02:05:34,043 --> 02:05:37,187
"Jakkara... Jakkara... Jakkanna."

2213
02:06:08,187 --> 02:06:11,344
"Biting your lips is turning me nuts."

2214
02:06:11,664 --> 02:06:14,730
"It tastes as if it is
having chilli flavours."

2215
02:06:14,930 --> 02:06:18,221
"You lips are like glue."

2216
02:06:18,522 --> 02:06:21,495
"They keep my lips glued
to your lips all the time"

2217
02:06:21,695 --> 02:06:26,576
"I will come like a king to Banjara Hills."

2218
02:06:27,120 --> 02:06:31,719
"If you step on the roads,
they tend to become reverse."

2219
02:06:32,112 --> 02:06:35,222
"Hey, I love you from
the bottom of my heart."

2220
02:06:35,982 --> 02:06:38,556
"Come to home will enjoy."

2221
02:06:38,953 --> 02:06:41,204
"Her body is super."

2222
02:06:42,978 --> 02:06:45,180
"You are the daughter of Cupid's relative."

2223
02:06:46,332 --> 02:06:48,544
"This handsome's body is super,."

2224
02:06:49,728 --> 02:06:52,340
"He is a big James Bond."

2225
02:07:28,739 --> 02:07:32,015
"Your plaits are producing
rhythmic drum music."

2226
02:07:32,215 --> 02:07:35,360
"It seems there is DJ around me."

2227
02:07:35,560 --> 02:07:38,784
"The way you touch me"

2228
02:07:38,988 --> 02:07:42,318
"I feel to have you all the time with me."

2229
02:07:42,518 --> 02:07:45,646
"Greetings, my dear girl."

2230
02:07:46,268 --> 02:07:49,162
"Our link got connected."

2231
02:07:49,362 --> 02:07:51,717
"Her eyes are super."

2232
02:07:53,229 --> 02:07:55,401
"Like a laser which cuts."

2233
02:07:56,530 --> 02:07:59,432
"This handsome's heart is super,."

2234
02:07:59,993 --> 02:08:02,622
"If hide in it, it's like a safe locker."

2235
02:08:03,062 --> 02:08:06,336
"Jakkara... Jakkara... Jakkanna."

2236
02:08:06,665 --> 02:08:09,812
"Jakkara... Jakkara... Jakkanna."

2237
02:08:22,371 --> 02:08:23,561
Where is son-in-law?

2238
02:08:23,808 --> 02:08:25,656
Where have he gone?

2239
02:08:26,856 --> 02:08:27,856
Sahasra?

2240
02:08:28,260 --> 02:08:29,720
They are killing my brother.

2241
02:08:29,920 --> 02:08:31,205
Ah!

2242
02:08:32,053 --> 02:08:33,375
Where are you Sahasra?

2243
02:08:35,238 --> 02:08:36,530
She is near to her death.

2244
02:08:37,041 --> 02:08:39,196
You told that Bairagi is your life right?

2245
02:08:39,676 --> 02:08:41,116
Then your life is going to die here.

2246
02:08:41,297 --> 02:08:43,817
If you come quickly you would
get a chance to see his dead body.

2247
02:09:40,109 --> 02:09:43,309
I thought every time
when my heart pounded

2248
02:09:43,441 --> 02:09:44,836
about the ways to kill you.

2249
02:09:45,036 --> 02:09:46,427
I got you now.

2250
02:09:53,096 --> 02:09:54,159
In order to kill you,

2251
02:09:54,383 --> 02:09:57,026
I had join my enemies.

2252
02:10:01,572 --> 02:10:03,645
You've shown me hell in the name of help.

2253
02:10:03,908 --> 02:10:04,908
No, brother.

2254
02:10:09,651 --> 02:10:13,570
I've done this to make you happy.

2255
02:10:14,258 --> 02:10:16,185
I'll be happy only if you die.

2256
02:10:23,280 --> 02:10:26,328
He is dead. Now, forget him.

2257
02:10:38,040 --> 02:10:40,225
- What's this?
- Backstabbing.

2258
02:10:41,296 --> 02:10:43,309
It is more dangerous than heart attack.

2259
02:10:44,221 --> 02:10:48,194
This is not your plan. It is ours.

2260
02:10:50,455 --> 02:10:51,935
As we can't kill you when he's alive,

2261
02:10:52,120 --> 02:10:54,541
we waited until we made you to kill him.

2262
02:10:54,654 --> 02:10:56,112
But the work is finished, Bairagi.

2263
02:10:56,312 --> 02:10:58,020
I'll be Bairagi of this city from now.

2264
02:10:58,316 --> 02:10:59,316
I'll be Bairagi.

2265
02:11:29,350 --> 02:11:31,049
He's got right to kill me,

2266
02:11:31,336 --> 02:11:33,910
because he saved my life.

2267
02:11:34,399 --> 02:11:36,403
No one has the right to kill Bairagi.

2268
02:11:54,245 --> 02:11:55,245
Hey!

2269
02:11:58,573 --> 02:11:59,573
Hey!

2270
02:12:08,671 --> 02:12:10,474
Hey!

2271
02:12:10,674 --> 02:12:13,148
Hey!

2272
02:12:27,604 --> 02:12:28,604
Hey!

2273
02:12:36,798 --> 02:12:37,798
What is this?

2274
02:12:39,699 --> 02:12:40,699
Is this a six pack?

2275
02:12:41,527 --> 02:12:42,927
Brother, did that very long before.

2276
02:12:43,278 --> 02:12:44,300
You are very late.

2277
02:13:01,749 --> 02:13:06,184
If you feel that you can be happy only
by killing me. Then kill me, brother.

2278
02:13:26,660 --> 02:13:29,249
Brother,
you've again saved my life.

2279
02:13:30,112 --> 02:13:31,728
No, don't again assume this as a help.

2280
02:13:31,928 --> 02:13:33,976
I killed him by feeling
that you are my man.

2281
02:13:34,071 --> 02:13:36,998
My life got upside down
for saving you once.

2282
02:13:37,315 --> 02:13:39,707
Please, no. I beg you.

2283
02:13:40,230 --> 02:13:42,747
If I did so much for
saving my life for one time,

2284
02:13:43,248 --> 02:13:45,888
you saved my life for the second time.
Imagine what else will I do.

2285
02:13:46,754 --> 02:13:49,524
Please, try to understand.

2286
02:13:57,122 --> 02:13:58,338
What are you staring at?

2287
02:13:58,698 --> 02:14:01,459
You were pondering all these days
about what's he doing to you, right?

2288
02:14:02,704 --> 02:14:03,964
He made you a cop.

2289
02:14:08,468 --> 02:14:11,842
- There is some link to you and Khaki.
- He meant Khaki as uniform?

2290
02:14:11,935 --> 02:14:14,749
He turned your life as a
cop but not upside down.

2291
02:14:16,474 --> 02:14:18,192
We both did this together.

2292
02:14:18,599 --> 02:14:19,783
I'm his uncle.

2293
02:14:21,458 --> 02:14:25,208
You ran on that day escaping from Kabaali,
right? That was 2k run.

2294
02:14:28,539 --> 02:14:30,859
Everything you did in the
police ground was physical tests.

2295
02:14:37,688 --> 02:14:41,459
It was a written test when you came
to kill me in the exam hall.

2296
02:14:46,302 --> 02:14:49,796
Today, it wasn't just your
engagement but it was a police interview.

2297
02:14:54,634 --> 02:14:56,714
You passed all the tests
conducted by the department.

2298
02:14:57,039 --> 02:14:58,679
Now we both belong to
the same department.

2299
02:14:59,721 --> 02:15:00,841
Here is your training order.

2300
02:15:03,208 --> 02:15:04,494
Why did you do all these?

2301
02:15:04,712 --> 02:15:07,773
Try to recall the dress you were
wearing when you came to kill that Dega.

2302
02:15:11,021 --> 02:15:13,583
I liked you very much in that
dress. I thought you were the police.

2303
02:15:13,607 --> 02:15:14,710
I got to know when I came here that,

2304
02:15:14,734 --> 02:15:16,774
you aren't a cop but the
cops are searching for you.

2305
02:15:16,959 --> 02:15:21,946
Brother, you helped. So I took care
of your life and made you a cop.

2306
02:15:22,167 --> 02:15:23,287
You are settled now.

2307
02:15:27,291 --> 02:15:29,916
Do you know what he is
trying to do with you?

2308
02:15:31,909 --> 02:15:34,771
He is trying to make you cop.
Kill him.

2309
02:15:35,093 --> 02:15:39,247
"Bhale Bhale Magadivoy
song from Bhale Bhale Magadivoy movie."

2310
02:15:39,373 --> 02:15:42,061
You all are very happy.
Shall I make tea for you all?

2311
02:15:42,261 --> 02:15:44,461
- Make it one by five.
- Do you want it strong or light?

2312
02:15:44,524 --> 02:15:45,524
Get lost.

2313
02:15:46,556 --> 02:15:48,999
If that Jakkanna sculptured
a God out of a stone,

2314
02:15:49,655 --> 02:15:53,640
our Jakkanna rewrote your
fate and made you a cop.

2315
02:15:53,740 --> 02:15:56,069
"He is the helper to the help."

2316
02:15:56,204 --> 02:15:58,177
"He is the symbol of the help."

2317
02:15:58,266 --> 02:16:02,171
"He'll come in seconds if you
pronounce the spelling of help."

2318
02:16:02,610 --> 02:16:04,840
"Help him and see."

2319
02:16:05,071 --> 02:16:06,874
"He will look after your life."

2320
02:16:06,998 --> 02:16:09,162
We still don't know the proper
information about Bairagi.

2321
02:16:09,186 --> 02:16:13,094
But I feel so jealousy
whenever I remember him.

2322
02:16:13,926 --> 02:16:14,926
Do you know why?

2323
02:16:16,746 --> 02:16:21,443
Why there isn't such an
intelligent guy in our department?
