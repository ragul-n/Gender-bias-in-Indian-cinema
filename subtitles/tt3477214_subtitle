1
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:43,874
Destruction is the duty of time.

2
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,710
He destroyed the dinosaurs in the ice-age.

3
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:49,852
He destroyed kingdoms and royalty
in the era of democracy.

4
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:55,023
I'm the last surviving
member of one such species.

5
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:58,359
I am King Braj Singhdeo

6
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,629
The story dates back
to my childhood in 1985

7
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:07,066
of a king and his people
in a small part of eastern India

8
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:10,502
This is a story of
a king and his subjects

9
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:14,434
A long time ago,
all this land was ours

10
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:22,146
How much ever land a king possesses,
it never feels enough

11
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:27,321
But, father,
where did all the land go?

12
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,919
Under the Land Ceiling Act,
the government

13
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:33,454
confiscated thousands of acres

14
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,291
But that doesn't
make a prince a pauper

15
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:49,644
Even today, commoners won't
raise their eyes to meet ours

16
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,046
Prince Brajkishore Singhdeo,
promise me

17
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:56,417
that you will establish
our empire again

18
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:01,153
But how?

19
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:04,487
You need vision for that, Prince

20
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:07,120
That's why I have arranged
your sister's marriage

21
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,633
into an influential political family

22
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,604
One arrow, many targets

23
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:22,438
The king had hatched a plot,
but he hadn't

24
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:26,282
accounted for Cupid's arrow

25
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,456
Nor did the arrow
follow the hunter's gaze

26
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,350
And the target was low caste Dora

27
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:40,460
Brother, some water please

28
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,658
You forgot your own caste?

29
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:47,828
Thirst has no caste
but it must be quenched

30
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:51,037
Don't act smart. Get back to work

31
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:54,536
This is the same Dora,
who never dared to

32
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:57,979
raise his gaze above our knees,

33
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:00,379
How could he?

34
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:06,424
Because he is from a low caste,
that has served royalty all its life

35
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:12,863
Their duty was to serve,

36
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:15,290
ours was to enjoy

37
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:20,564
We both performed our duties well

38
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:41,991
Congratulations!

39
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:43,387
And to you too!

40
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,687
Two auspicious deeds on the same day

41
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,832
The king's daughter
is getting engaged,

42
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:52,199
And ritual offerings are
being sent to the big temple

43
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:55,298
Long live Lord Jagannath!

44
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:58,635
Long live Lord Jagannath!

45
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:03,914
(Prayer chants)

46
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:11,946
Long live Lord Jagannath!

47
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,147
Long live Lord Jagannath!

48
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,123
Long live Lord Jagannath!

49
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:18,025
Long live Lord Jagannath!

50
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,669
Long live Lord Jagannath!

51
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,470
You have polluted the holy
offerings with your shadow!

52
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:36,603
(Purifications chants)

53
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:41,149
Get away, beggars!

54
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,279
Long live Jagannath!

55
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:49,691
Long live Jagannath!

56
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:54,229
I'm so angry, I could shove
the holy pot into him-and purify them

57
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,390
Calm down...

58
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,900
from sowing to harvesting,
we slave away,

59
00:05:58,091 --> 00:05:59,468
but all these swines do is shit

60
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:02,540
Good thing they at
least shit by themselves

61
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,540
A wise man said that
for the common man,

62
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:06,733
religion is the biggest intoxicant

63
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:09,505
Anyone opposing them
is bound to pay the price

64
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:12,173
That wise man has surely
never been in love

65
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,247
Satisfied?

66
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,547
Dora, now stop fantasising

67
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:21,855
These upper caste
people can be very mean

68
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,528
Kharu was right

69
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:29,689
But love is blind

70
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:33,738
As the poet Khusro said,

71
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,241
'O Khusro, the river
of love has strange currents.

72
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,141
He who jumps in, drowns

73
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,941
He who drowns, gets across!'

74
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,351
No!

75
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,884
Leave him, please!

76
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:03,032
( Screams )

77
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,069
Get rid of this old man!

78
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,813
Leave him!

79
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,982
Laxmi!

80
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,685
Dora!

81
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:33,895
Dora, Dora!

82
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:36,758
Dora, get up!

83
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,432
Dora!

84
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,302
Dora!

85
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:01,186
The king fulfilled his royal duties,

86
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:03,991
Dispensing justice
from the barrel of a gun

87
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:08,624
But I was never
sure-was this justice?

88
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:37,388
IN TROUBLED WATERS

89
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:48,928
It was a dark time,

90
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,469
Fostering even darker thoughts

91
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:53,471
It wasn't my father's fault,

92
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,444
The times were such

93
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,840
He didn't allow them to understand.

94
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:00,640
That the justice
the king meted out today..

95
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:04,620
...will be a curse to
his descendants tomorrow.

96
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:09,687
This wall isn't being built today,
it was always there.

97
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:14,260
Remember,
this is what happens to those

98
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,493
who dare to break the rules

99
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:20,933
My lord, you have meted
justice to my son,

100
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:26,843
But it is raining in our village
after three years

101
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,168
Please let us save this water, my lord

102
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,815
The wall can be built later

103
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:36,283
Please let us store the rain water

104
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:40,755
Forget water, you don't even
deserve <i>piss,</i> you swines

105
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:46,592
You have had enough
freebies from the royals

106
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:52,327
Let's see how you will survive
on barren land on your own

107
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:38,537
The fish is the queen of the water,

108
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:41,011
water is her life

109
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:45,454
What fish? And whose water?

110
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:53,589
It's about life, there is
no life without water

111
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:59,129
Rain would come to our area
like a guest,

112
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,827
for just a couple of days

113
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:05,567
Yet, it would leave a year-long
water supply as a gift

114
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:10,170
But when the people who
took care of the rainwater left,

115
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:13,345
the water left as well

116
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:20,855
It still rains, but we don't honour it

117
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:23,894
How could we?

118
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:27,757
The rich would not
even wash themselves

119
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:34,504
it still rains, but the water
flows down to the Lower Village

120
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:41,172
where it is welcomed,
respected and stored

121
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:46,215
We couldn't do all this
because we were wealthy

122
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,421
We spent money like water

123
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:57,321
A royal kingdom with high caste people
must have big egos

124
00:11:57,616 --> 00:12:01,758
We were utterly ruined in the last 3O years.

125
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:10,264
(chanting of prayers)

126
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:13,709
Bearer!

127
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:23,949
Where the hell are you?

128
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:26,114
Coming, my lord!

129
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,845
Long live Lord Jagannath!

130
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,279
Bearer!

131
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:05,946
Yes my lord!

132
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:10,160
Should I add a touch
of white to my moustache?

133
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:14,696
No, my lord! A king's moustache
can never be wilted, nor white

134
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,528
What king?

135
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:26,309
I feel like a bull these days, but I
don't even know whom to chase any more

136
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:30,775
My lord, won't you go out to celebrate
Holi, the festival of colours?

137
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:35,942
Holi is a festival of the low castes

138
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:39,949
We warriors celebrate Dussehra

139
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:43,820
Bearer!

140
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:44,656
Yes my lord!

141
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,596
We have acquired all these lands,

142
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:52,928
but why not these two plots'?

143
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:56,531
The documents will be here any time

144
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,468
So should I...

145
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:02,171
Yes, please mark them

146
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,088
Father, even this dream of yours
has come true

147
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:24,797
Nature's call

148
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,998
It's today's

149
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:29,302
I don't want to read it

150
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:31,341
Don't worry,
there's water for that today

151
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:35,436
Ah, then I'll take a bath today

152
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:42,448
My lord, there's only one tin
of water left. Either we cook or...

153
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,984
Then I'll just gargle

154
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:50,821
My lord, please gulp what you gargle

155
00:15:54,954 --> 00:16:00,131
I'm really sorry, the auction was
pegged at Rs 1O million

156
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:04,899
But in the last half an hour, not one
bidder has come forward

157
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:07,541
Mr Agarwal, what's happening?

158
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:09,875
This is dry land without water,
Mr Mohanty

159
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:12,438
Set a practical price

160
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:15,878
Shall I halve it?
Rs 5 million it is now

161
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:19,085
Come on now, it's just Rs 5 million

162
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:23,090
Rs 5 million

163
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:28,655
It's still not good enough,
Mr. Mohanty

164
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,427
Should I make it Rs 2.5 million?

165
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,062
Ok, Rs 2.5 million

166
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,373
Hey, it's just Rs 2.5 million

167
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,504
I said, it's just Rs 2.5 million!

168
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,952
Mr Agarwal, shall I make it Rs.
500,000?

169
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:52,052
Stop it, I say! Is this an auction
or a bloody joke?

170
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:55,649
My lord, Rs 500,000 is rather high
for this dry land

171
00:16:55,914 --> 00:17:00,260
Your 'assets' are no good either,
shall break your balls?

172
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:03,198
My lord, be careful! They are
my most precious assets

173
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:05,996
So are mine. Get lost!

174
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:09,395
Get lost!

175
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:14,842
Get lost!

176
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:35,796
You should have made the best
of a bad deal, my lord

177
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,799
Swiped the pants off a thief!

178
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:43,306
This is Singhdeds kingdom.
It will sell for a royal sum,

179
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:46,374
not the price of a retired whore

180
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:52,048
My lord, I warned you not
to do such an inauspicious thing

181
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,217
on an auspicious day

182
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:58,254
What auspicious day? Even on Holi,
there's not a drop

183
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:00,345
of water in the village

184
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:31,079
This reward is neither because of
Kharu the Wrestler,

185
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:34,323
nor because of my daughter Faro

186
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,895
It's because of all of you

187
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:43,457
The day is not far, when
Kharu the Wrestler will be elected

188
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,532
Member of the Legislative
Assembly (MLA) in Odisha state

189
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:47,832
Just a minute, Dad!

190
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:50,430
<i>Today is Ho“,</i>

191
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:53,272
but there's an even bigger reason
to celebrate

192
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:59,279
Today the Indian President has honoured
us with the 'Clean Village Award'

193
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:03,810
Cheers to the Lower Village!

194
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:06,412
Here's to Kharu the Wrestler!

195
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:12,561
I wish you all Happy Holi!

196
00:19:55,027 --> 00:20:00,033
L, Kharu the Wrestler,
swear before God,

197
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:03,807
that I will respect the
Constitution of India

198
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:07,379
And I will do my duty
towards my fellowmen

199
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:11,180
with full dedication and honesty

200
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:16,418
As MLA of Odisha, I will serve
the people with fairness

201
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:20,452
Mother, our leader is practising
his speech-leave him alone

202
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,633
I, Kharu the Wrestler...

203
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,069
I, Kharu the Wrestler...

204
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:46,484
It is our good fortune that you
are visiting our village

205
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:54,523
I have heard that the rice crop here
hasn't been good lately

206
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:59,902
Yet, Minister Madam's office
keeps calling us to choose

207
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,766
your rice for the ritual offerings

208
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:07,910
Please show me a sample quickly,
I have to check samples elsewhere too

209
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,447
Sir, please don't compare
our village to any other

210
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:15,417
We've really struggled to settle here

211
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:20,556
I hear that the Upper Village
used to grow the best rice

212
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,785
In fact, we used to
cultivate the rice there

213
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:27,194
Earlier we grew in fertile soil,
now we cultivate barren lands

214
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:31,000
O Priest

215
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:35,597
That's my daughter. She's in college.
She has studied agriculture

216
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,907
Greetings! This is without...

217
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:40,272
Say it in English. He knows English

218
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:43,906
We haven't used any chemicals
or fertilisers for this crop

219
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:47,217
It's fully organic

220
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:54,351
Okay, I will convey this to the
temple's working committee,

221
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:58,117
and we will let you know the result

222
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:00,290
O Priest, please have something

223
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:01,728
It's okay

224
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:23,484
Bloody bastard!

225
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:25,350
Don't you dare touch my water!

226
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:27,014
This is the Upper Village mister,

227
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:29,615
water will be charged separately

228
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:32,452
Swallow your spit and carry on

229
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:35,160
Come on, give me my water pouches

230
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,865
First come here, baby

231
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:39,834
Enough! Give me my water pouches

232
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:49,578
Here you go...one...two...

233
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:53,544
my sweetheart. . .and three...

234
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,976
And the other two?

235
00:22:58,009 --> 00:22:59,750
They're over

236
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:06,826
Just give my pouches.
Otherwise I'll spread a rumour

237
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:10,659
that your 'gears' get stuck
while running

238
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:15,494
Packet, packet, all the time!

239
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:17,038
You really didn't bring them?

240
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:19,732
Next time I'll bring you a water drum
from the city

241
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:21,032
Bloody freeloader!

242
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:23,101
Comes here for free sex

243
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:24,544
Get lost!

244
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:28,306
Next time you're here,
I'll charge you with interest

245
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:30,715
Bastard!

246
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:42,865
Bhulia!

247
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:44,660
O Bhulia!

248
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:45,834
Who's it?

249
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:49,598
Show your bed some mercy,
if not your wife!

250
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:51,002
What do you want?

251
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:53,335
Bloody hell, always screwing around

252
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:56,008
Open the door!

253
00:23:58,336 --> 00:23:59,371
What's up?

254
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,315
Could you weave a silk sari for me'?

255
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,213
Silk sari?
- Yes!

256
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:05,047
Sure

257
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:06,449
but it will take time

258
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:09,458
Stop your Kamasutra and
do some work instead

259
00:24:09,514 --> 00:24:11,016
then it won't be long

260
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,820
I've brought you an advance

261
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:19,864
Here...1,2,3

262
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:21,359
Now?

263
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,167
<i>I'll</i> do it in a jiffy

264
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:27,838
Hey, give your wife a break
and get started on the loom

265
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:30,106
Make me a first class sari

266
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:31,112
Yeah, yeah

267
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:32,648
I'm off

268
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:43,189
You fools have no
idea what I've planned

269
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:53,568
Just as the chinky-eyed Chinese are
drawing water from the Brahmaputra river,

270
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:56,339
in the same way, this weaver

271
00:24:57,762 --> 00:25:01,835
will make a tunnel to pull
all the water from the Lower Village

272
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:10,716
One day, instead of the loom,
we'll have a water factory

273
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:18,689
Careful,

274
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:20,997
Come on

275
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:28,366
Come on

276
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:30,937
O Priest!

277
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:35,808
On Saturday I was to give you

278
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,279
Offerings? Give me

279
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:43,352
Oh Gulapi, my darling!

280
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:44,785
Put it here

281
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,252
God bless!

282
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,258
She takes from us and gives it here

283
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,962
Greetings, O Priest

284
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,798
We are alive only
because of her

285
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:01,632
I see

286
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:05,005
For the last 15 years, you've kept
us bachelors

287
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,737
When will we ever get married?

288
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:11,041
When the destiny of this
village itself is cursed,

289
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:14,978
how do you expect
to please the gods

290
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:16,880
without doing a water ritual

291
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:18,977
to invoke prosperity?

292
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:21,217
Anyway you can't do it because

293
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,952
there is no water

294
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:24,925
Tell us something we don't know

295
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:29,487
The government has so many
schemes, dug wells

296
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:30,566
but they're all dry

297
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:35,731
Had our ancestors saved water,
we could have used our wells today

298
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:41,775
Let alone the land, the morons
didn't even spare the groundwater

299
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,415
Now let's manage the rituals
with whatever water you have

300
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:49,481
You want to get married for free, eh?

301
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:50,752
Pay up!

302
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:53,516
Here...marriage fees

303
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:57,886
Forget it, you just want to jerk off!

304
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,758
You're pulling my leg too

305
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:02,798
Put out your hand

306
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:10,637
Tie this thread on your wrist at 6:61
before sunrise tomorrow

307
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:12,773
Your problem will be solved
and you'll get married. Now go

308
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:14,811
So we'll get married?
- What if I'm late?

309
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:17,107
I'll talk to the goddess. Buzz off now

310
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:20,240
Please do. Long live the priest

311
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:46,542
My dear (marijuana) plants,
my babies...

312
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:49,477
Quickly bear me fruits

313
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:54,811
I'm getting more desperate
and my stock is decreasing

314
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:03,718
Long live Lord Shiva!

315
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:13,994
How heavy is this sorrow,
how tender my heart,

316
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:19,225
the world doesn't
understand (Bollywood song)

317
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:34,212
My lord, would you like
your peg with soda or water?

318
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:39,556
Can you make it with water?

319
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:41,823
Well, it's my duty to ask

320
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:45,390
Come, my Prince

321
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:50,202
Why are you sneaking into
the house like a thief?

322
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:54,343
I am not trying to be Phantom.
Just dodging the filth

323
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:57,079
What a village! You don't know if
you're stepping into mud or shit

324
00:28:57,168 --> 00:28:58,511
Stop making a fuss

325
00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:01,809
For three kilometres, I've been
holding my nose and playing leap frog

326
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:04,410
Relax and catch your breath...Bearer,

327
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:07,248
pour the Prince a peg

328
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:10,019
No peg. Some water first, please

329
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:12,550
What should I serve him, my lord?

330
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:18,057
Yesterday's soda bottle would
have lost its fizz. Give it to him

331
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:28,267
How come you are here
before your holidays?

332
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,345
You really think I have come here
to enjoy my holidays?

333
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:36,146
How long will this go on, Dad?

334
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:40,780
Since three months, I've been
living off my friends

335
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:42,515
Prince, my foot!

336
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:46,892
Make it a sturdy habit to take loans
from your friends

337
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:51,456
Because my bank balance
is a resounding zero

338
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:52,799
What you mean?

339
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:55,098
We are absolutely broke

340
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,799
How come'?

341
00:29:57,862 --> 00:30:01,173
I've still to finish my studies,
and go to London

342
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:03,937
I even have my acceptance letter, Dad

343
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:08,280
I'll make you a paper plane,
which you can fly to London

344
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:12,822
Forget your fees, I can't even afford
your ticket

345
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:17,984
Now stop all this. Settle down here
and help me

346
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:21,753
Help you do what?
Pour pegs?

347
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:26,132
For all your education,
you haven't an ounce of sense

348
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,228
We have so much land

349
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:29,533
What land?

350
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:32,768
I admit no one's buying the land

351
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,971
Even when there's an auction,
the price drops from Rs 1O million

352
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:40,015
7 million to 4 million and finally,
we won't even get peanuts

353
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:45,376
These bloody businessmen
have no guts

354
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:56,924
Listen, that agent Jena will bring
some foreigners to see the land

355
00:30:57,121 --> 00:31:01,069
You talk to them in English

356
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:06,506
Let me see whether you
deserve to go to London,

357
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:08,969
Have your soda

358
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:13,177
I prefer a peg

359
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:21,914
Village, tree, hill, whole land...mine

360
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:26,262
What he's trying to say is that
the whole land is mine

361
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:31,366
So, are you trying to say
the entire land belongs to you?

362
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:35,461
Sure
- No you, no you. Mine, king.

363
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:39,933
Prince. After death, his...whole land

364
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:42,137
These are the documents, in case you
want to have a look

365
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,702
All paper

366
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:47,113
Come, come, let me show you around.
Please come

367
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:51,920
So this is where
the housing colony is,

368
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,887
you know, right across there

369
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:56,255
And this is where, you know,
the villagers hang out

370
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:58,292
in the evening and stuff

371
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:04,129
There seem to be serious
sanitation issues here

372
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:06,725
No, no, that's not something
you should worry about at all

373
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:08,393
We've already spoken
to the government, and

374
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:10,564
they have assured us 100% sanitation

375
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:12,369
What is he asking?
- Nothing

376
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,008
This is where the proposed
national highway is coming up

377
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:17,637
So you'll feel like
the capital is right here

378
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:19,212
This way please

379
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:25,076
Bearer!
- My lord

380
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:28,385
The Prince will go to London

381
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,587
This land, old land,

382
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:34,491
and all Indian they come,
they buy whole land

383
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:38,564
But Raja say, no Indian Baniya,

384
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:41,570
only only English, sale only English

385
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:44,263
Ask him how much he'll pay

386
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:47,636
So what kind of offer
are we looking at here?

387
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:53,315
Well, I feel a figure
of Rs 150 million should

388
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:55,279
be a fair price for the whole village

389
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,815
Can I see the other side
of the village as well?

390
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:00,018
How much did he say'?

391
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:02,953
He's saying Rs 150 million

392
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:05,125
Rs 150 million?

393
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:10,595
What's there to think...sell it now!
Let's go

394
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:13,297
Ask him when he'll pay

395
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:15,302
So, how do we take this forward now?

396
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,667
The money is ready whenever you are

397
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:20,009
What is the source of water?

398
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:23,179
Water. . .why water?

399
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:29,478
Water, land,
village, hill, sell, buy...water

400
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:34,178
Maharaja, no water, no deal

401
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,723
Namaste!

402
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:42,089
Hey Bearer

403
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:51,564
My lord, where do I display this now?

404
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:54,166
Shove it up your backside!

405
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:56,377
Dad!

406
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:10,722
You damned son of a python!

407
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:13,791
You've been digging all night
And managed so little

408
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,057
Try harder!

409
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:17,323
When will it be my turn?

410
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:17,957
What?

411
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,660
When will it be my turn?

412
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,173
Well, my little mouse

413
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:31,309
When this tunnel becomes narrow,
it will be your turn

414
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:33,081
Run off now

415
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:34,909
Try harder!

416
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:39,517
Bloody traitor! They were talking
rubbish about us,

417
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,557
and you're still taking their photos?

418
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:43,285
My lord, it's my bread and butter

419
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,893
Get lost!

420
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:53,226
These people want to
send rice to the Shiva temple!

421
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,961
Getting stressed and swearing
won't solve the problem

422
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,539
Really?

423
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:02,002
Then what's the solution,
Your Highness?

424
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:04,171
You're all hot air

425
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:05,813
and no results

426
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,640
As if you let me do anything

427
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:11,181
If I give you the chance,
will you do it?

428
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:14,180
Bearer!
- My lord

429
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,216
Leave us alone

430
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:22,822
Even if it means burning
their entire harvest,

431
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:25,931
the rice of Lower Village should
not reach the temple

432
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:28,402
It shouldn't reach!

433
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:36,808
Calm down. I will complain
to the temple priest and the trust

434
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,072
The king is right

435
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:41,639
Yes, yes
- What do you mean he's right?

436
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:44,149
Tell me

437
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:48,583
Stop this boot licking, Village Headman
- Meaning?

438
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:54,995
All the free lunches, booze and loans
you lived off

439
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:57,259
Who will redeem all that,
you lazybones?

440
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:00,697
Don't say that, Prince. Once
the village is sold, everyone will

441
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:04,262
use their share to pay off their loans

442
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:08,975
And who will buy this village, where
there's not a drop of water? Forget it!

443
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:12,879
You are our only saviour, Prince.
Only you can bring

444
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:14,813
water to this village
and sell this land

445
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:16,544
Am <i>I</i> your pimp?

446
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:18,186
Or your servant?

447
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:22,847
It's not my job to bring
water or sell the village

448
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:26,854
Why should the son
pay for his ancestors'

449
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:28,397
failures, extravagance and stupidity?

450
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:32,229
Listen, Prince, mind your tongue

451
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:34,594
This village is your family

452
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:37,503
You will not speak
to your elders like this

453
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:39,473
What have your elders done for me'?

454
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:41,942
And what have you ever done for me'?

455
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:47,815
I'm giving you one week. One week

456
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:50,546
I want my share of the property, or...

457
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:54,612
Property? You want what?

458
00:36:57,181 --> 00:37:00,754
You want property? Get lost!

459
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:04,561
No one should give him even
a drop of water. No one...

460
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,759
You haven't even got any

461
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:08,393
I will take shelter
in the Lower Village

462
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:09,937
I hope you die there!

463
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:14,909
Listen, Mr Braj Singhdeo,
we will meet in court next!

464
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,477
Fine! In the court, then!

465
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:17,478
In court, then!

466
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:18,912
I'll rip you apart

467
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:20,311
Sure, rip me!

468
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:22,851
I'll see you in court

469
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:26,188
In dark times, darker thoughts prevail

470
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:30,586
Priest, my dark thoughts
won't do you any good either

471
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:32,354
So keep quiet

472
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:53,975
I am not a king, that I should reward
good news with my gold necklace

473
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:58,682
We are workers who
care for the community

474
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,216
What do you want?

475
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:06,559
Sir, during this year's election, don't
call the photographer from the city

476
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,096
let me take the photographs

477
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:09,893
Sure

478
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:11,963
OK, take my picture

479
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:17,004
Smile, please

480
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:19,096
Happy days are here

481
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:21,642
The kingdom was already ruined

482
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:23,679
Now he has kicked out his heir too

483
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:26,212
Jai Jagannath!

484
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,179
Why did you stop? You should have
thrashed me completely

485
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:32,752
At least you would have vented
your frustration

486
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:34,981
You've ripped the hair from my chest

487
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:38,659
Did the doctor forbid you
from wearing a vest?

488
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:40,418
You want to be a hero?

489
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:48,434
Let bygones be bygones

490
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:52,965
Anyway, there was only
one way to save our honour

491
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:55,600
and for you to go to London

492
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:57,006
So you want to sacrifice your son

493
00:38:57,101 --> 00:39:01,777
You're not my son. Whenever I see you,

494
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,217
I see your grandfather's face

495
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:06,753
What kind of father tells
his son to chase girls?

496
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:13,591
I didn't ask you
to climb Mount Everest

497
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:16,527
I simply asked you
to sleep with a girl

498
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:19,295
Can't you even handle a girl?

499
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:30,012
Look son, commoners feel
proud when royalty screws around

500
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:33,612
Proud? Today it's called rape

501
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,373
And a non-bailable offence

502
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:38,420
Screw legally, then

503
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:41,282
What's it called?

504
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,022
Consensual sex

505
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:46,584
Yeah. Do that sex then

506
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:51,724
A Warrior's duty is to conquer

507
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:57,232
Earlier, we use to conquer forts,
but there aren't any left, so...

508
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:07,314
Remember, the foreigner said he would

509
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:11,212
buy the land only if there's water

510
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,688
But where will it come from?

511
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:18,293
And all the water
is in Kharu's village

512
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:22,764
He will die before
he gives us any water

513
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:31,070
So there's only one way--
get Kharu's daughter pregnant

514
00:40:31,328 --> 00:40:36,607
When he comes begging,
we can negotiate the water supply

515
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:39,212
What if I have to marry
into that caste, then?

516
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,316
Oh, now you've started
believing in caste

517
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:44,285
I don't, but you do

518
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:45,820
No, I don't believe in caste

519
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:47,045
Really?

520
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:48,555
No, no, I don't

521
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:51,786
It's only because of circumstances.
The truth is

522
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:54,625
You have eyes but don't notice
our plight

523
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:58,222
Have you thought what would
happen if I marry into a low caste?

524
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:03,667
If sex always ended in marriage,

525
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:06,909
your mother would not
have been the only queen

526
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:17,213
All I am asking you is,
to get after her

527
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:19,481
Stop talking like that, please

528
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:22,156
Just let me do it my way

529
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:27,686
Do it your way or mine

530
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:31,292
All I'm saying is, just do it!

531
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:33,432
And get her pregnant

532
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:35,165
Cheers!

533
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,210
Long live the king!

534
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:50,842
Long live the king!

535
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:55,653
What's the matter, he's walking
among commoners?

536
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:59,322
Enquiring about our well being?

537
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:02,190
No, he is out for a stroll

538
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:10,167
Upper Village people would
rather drink their own pee,

539
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:13,003
than drink water
from the Lower Village

540
00:42:13,097 --> 00:42:14,337
Should we pee?

541
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:18,174
Today commoners will
show the king mercy

542
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:21,977
Where is the Lokhit (People's
Welfare) Party office?

543
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:23,107
Why?

544
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:24,083
I want to join the party

545
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:25,585
You can't

546
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:26,888
Why?

547
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:29,648
We will have to ask the MLA first

548
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,320
Ask him

549
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,757
OK

550
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:38,628
Get his leg!

551
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:42,430
Smash him, that's it!

552
00:42:42,526 --> 00:42:44,733
Good, good

553
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:46,274
Smash him

554
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,001
Kharu Uncle!

555
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:50,004
What happened?

556
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:53,172
The Prince has come to our village

557
00:42:53,604 --> 00:42:56,312
Really? Here'?

558
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:00,985
Such guts...let's go

559
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,122
Thrash him!

560
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:09,858
Thrash him!

561
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:20,605
Kharu, stop!

562
00:43:24,301 --> 00:43:25,712
Calm down!

563
00:43:25,803 --> 00:43:33,244
Calm down, everyone! Be quiet!

564
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:36,052
But he...
-Hara Uncle, let me speak

565
00:43:37,815 --> 00:43:39,226
Why have you come here?

566
00:43:39,316 --> 00:43:42,763
Look, this is the People's
Welfare Party, and anyone can join it

567
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,831
You've jumped over the
wall you created, to come here?

568
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:47,528
You know how much
we all hate your father?

569
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:49,593
I hate my father even more

570
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,298
Yeah? Why'?

571
00:43:51,495 --> 00:43:55,637
He has ruined my village,
leaving nothing for anybody

572
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:58,807
The son is paying for
the follies of his ancestors

573
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:02,339
You have come here, despite
knowing all this? You think

574
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:05,511
You are royalty, you could have
joined any party

575
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:07,055
Why only ours'?

576
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:10,091
Look here, Sir, I am from
today's generation

577
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:13,627
And like you, I don't believe
in caste and creed

578
00:44:13,717 --> 00:44:16,630
Don't listen to him!

579
00:44:21,191 --> 00:44:22,795
Dad, please sit down

580
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:24,629
Get water

581
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,804
Papa!

582
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:30,773
You have every right to be angry.
Listen to me. Here

583
00:44:31,301 --> 00:44:33,941
They killed Dora!

584
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:34,914
I know
- Were you there?

585
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:37,508
No. But will you destroy
so many years of

586
00:44:37,574 --> 00:44:39,747
hard work because of your enmity?

587
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:41,752
But they killed Dora!

588
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:44,720
Papa, non-discrimination

589
00:44:44,948 --> 00:44:47,519
is the guiding principle of our party

590
00:44:49,586 --> 00:44:53,295
It's the People's Welfare Party.
Anyone can join

591
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:54,630
You can't stop them

592
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:56,432
These people killed your Dora Uncle

593
00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:59,167
Kharu, let's hear him out

594
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:02,077
He is educated, maybe we can use him

595
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:05,636
Have the upper castes ever done
anything for anybody?

596
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:11,518
Silence!

597
00:45:12,342 --> 00:45:13,719
Silence!

598
00:45:13,911 --> 00:45:20,055
That's politics! We never dared gaze
above the knees of his ancestors,

599
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:23,595
yet their heir kneels
before us today

600
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:27,427
Amrita Devi is finally
paying you attention

601
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,295
Be careful, or you'll ruin everything

602
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:31,839
Try to understand the
balance of power, my friend

603
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:35,600
The balance of power
is the key to politics

604
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:44,315
Kharu the Wrestler is the first commoner
to keep a king under his thumb

605
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:46,317
Yes, indeed

606
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:50,357
We will keep him underfoot

607
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:52,590
Got it

608
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:01,633
Rather nice room you have here

609
00:46:01,892 --> 00:46:04,463
This is for you

610
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:23,251
Water for you. Take this

611
00:46:24,248 --> 00:46:25,852
What's this?

612
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:30,292
It's a broom, not a sword

613
00:46:30,854 --> 00:46:34,301
Let me guess-His Highness
has never worked before

614
00:46:35,425 --> 00:46:37,962
We do all our work ourselves

615
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:39,433
So go ahead

616
00:46:48,205 --> 00:46:49,707
You have to go to the city?

617
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:50,982
Yes

618
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:54,718
Say 'Yes, Sir'

619
00:46:55,045 --> 00:46:56,319
Yes, Sir

620
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:59,055
'Yes, MLA Sir.

621
00:46:59,716 --> 00:47:01,286
Yes, MLA Sir

622
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:05,056
Repeat it

623
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:07,427
Yes, MLA Sir

624
00:47:10,294 --> 00:47:13,503
Make a list of all that's
to be done in the city

625
00:47:13,564 --> 00:47:17,603
I can remember it
- Don't argue, just write it down

626
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:21,272
Papa, Papa, a letter has come
from the temple

627
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:27,914
"This is to inform the Lower
Village Council that the rice

628
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:30,457
from your village has been chosen
for the ritual offering"

629
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:32,151
That's great news

630
00:47:32,216 --> 00:47:34,093
"Kindly arrange to
send the rice on the

631
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:37,131
auspicious occasion
of Akshaya Tritiya"

632
00:47:37,821 --> 00:47:44,466
"When it rains in the Mahua forest,
it's all water, water"

633
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:48,666
Papa, now practise your speech
as the agriculture minister

634
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:50,668
I am the Kharu Wrestler

635
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:51,837
In English

636
00:47:53,303 --> 00:47:55,806
MLA Sir, congratulations!

637
00:47:55,939 --> 00:47:57,714
You upper caste guys

638
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:06,354
You fought your father,

639
00:48:07,117 --> 00:48:11,691
otherwise I would have
sent the king sweets

640
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:15,400
The rice will go from our village

641
00:48:18,328 --> 00:48:20,069
Hey you

642
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:22,409
Sit

643
00:48:22,866 --> 00:48:24,311
On the floor

644
00:48:24,768 --> 00:48:25,769
Sit!

645
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:28,015
Why is he like this?

646
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:32,317
Listen to me carefully

647
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:36,249
Our city plan should go like clockwork

648
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,617
Otherwise, I'll beat you
to such a pulp,

649
00:48:38,682 --> 00:48:40,855
that even your father won't
be able to recognise you

650
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,463
Go to the party office

651
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:45,624
Yes, Sir

652
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:48,965
Get the papers from
Amrita Madam's office

653
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:50,471
and give them to Mr Hara

654
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:52,334
Yes, Sir
- Go

655
00:48:57,034 --> 00:48:58,479
May I take your Jeep?

656
00:48:58,535 --> 00:49:00,208
Go by bus

657
00:49:01,305 --> 00:49:04,582
Faro! Give him Rs 200

658
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,060
Any news of the temple offerings?

659
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:21,432
By the grace of Lord Jagannath,
the rice will go from our village

660
00:49:21,658 --> 00:49:23,433
Long live the lord!

661
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:25,234
What are you doing?

662
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:30,040
I'm making the Prince slog

663
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:31,705
You should too

664
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:35,113
I'm sending him over
- Papa is going to ask for the accounts

665
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,384
I'll email them

666
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:46,556
Murari went to the
farm to harvest his crop

667
00:49:51,588 --> 00:49:56,333
Murari went to the
farm to harvest his crop

668
00:49:56,626 --> 00:49:58,435
The seeds have barely sprouted,

669
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:01,499
Already he's ready to harvest them

670
00:50:01,698 --> 00:50:06,613
Murari went to the
farm to harvest his crop

671
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:11,710
Murari went to the
farm to harvest his crop

672
00:50:11,808 --> 00:50:14,345
Gun on his shoulder-but whose is it?

673
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:16,549
His? Theirs?

674
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:19,453
Gun on his shoulder-but whose is it?

675
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:24,632
Is Murari reaping only what he sowed'?

676
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:29,099
Murari went to the
farm to harvest his crop

677
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:34,268
Murari went to the
farm to harvest his crop

678
00:50:34,498 --> 00:50:36,876
The seeds have barely sprouted,

679
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,444
Already he's ready to harvest them

680
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:44,576
Murari went to the
farm to harvest his crop

681
00:50:46,743 --> 00:50:50,247
Now our last hopes are gone

682
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:54,722
I thought an educated prince
could get a good price

683
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:58,198
for our village, and deliver us
from this hell

684
00:50:58,255 --> 00:51:00,462
Instead, he's become a servant
at Lower Village

685
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:02,798
And this news from the temple,
on top of it!

686
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:06,500
If you wish, we will set fire
to their filthy village!

687
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:14,678
Please don't!

688
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:19,414
Take this, Prince!

689
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:27,117
I'm performing your last rites

690
00:51:28,351 --> 00:51:32,026
From today no one will dare
utter his name in the village,

691
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:34,428
or I'll shoot him

692
00:51:41,798 --> 00:51:45,007
There goes 1O days'
supply for washing our <i>asses</i>

693
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:59,885
Murari went to the
barber's for a shave

694
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:05,059
Murari went to the
barber's for a shave

695
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:10,571
But his clean shaven
face only brought ruin

696
00:52:10,727 --> 00:52:14,334
If you are mortgaging property
for a loan, I understand

697
00:52:14,731 --> 00:52:18,008
How can you mortgage a whole village?

698
00:52:18,268 --> 00:52:20,145
Get lost

699
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:25,479
The barber swiped his
blade this way and that

700
00:52:25,542 --> 00:52:30,457
With a nicked nose,
Murari sang a ghazal

701
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:33,389
Should the people here
bathe with just air?

702
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:36,158
I understand what you're trying
to say but... - Do you have water?

703
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:39,567
As soon as I get water,
I'll make the building

704
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:45,070
Murari went to the
farm to harvest his crop

705
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:47,942
Baba has guided you here

706
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:49,306
Don't worry,

707
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:52,904
This Baba has the solution
to all your problems

708
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:56,883
For the next 3 months, before sunrise,
father and son

709
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:01,020
should throw one pot
of water over yourselves,

710
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:05,388
and after sunset,
throw one pot of water towards the sky

711
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:24,973
Forget about me,
what are you doing there?

712
00:53:25,502 --> 00:53:27,641
Have you done something or not'?

713
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:32,749
Dad! What is this?
Can you please stop this now?

714
00:53:35,812 --> 00:53:39,726
Is the girl very ugly'?

715
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:41,361
No

716
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:44,723
Then what's your problem?
Just screw her!

717
00:53:44,788 --> 00:53:47,462
Hello... hello... hello...

718
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:04,442
My lord, isn't this a bit much?

719
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:06,815
Bearer!

720
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:10,917
The problem is, nothing is happening

721
00:54:11,014 --> 00:54:13,688
I'm not sure if the Prince
will be able to do it

722
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:17,197
You have never trusted the Prince

723
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:30,805
What are you doing here?

724
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,505
Nothing

725
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:37,482
Do you need any help?

726
00:54:37,574 --> 00:54:39,315
No, thanks

727
00:54:40,143 --> 00:54:41,315
OK

728
00:54:42,812 --> 00:54:44,052
Listen

729
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:46,755
Careful

730
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:48,585
<i>UH!</i>

731
00:55:02,165 --> 00:55:03,508
This was once a stable for cows

732
00:55:04,267 --> 00:55:06,645
They must be missing their home

733
00:55:08,271 --> 00:55:12,242
I know the feeling of missing home

734
00:55:29,726 --> 00:55:34,300
I never had to do all this work,
otherwise I would have helped you

735
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:39,339
That's not what I was thinking

736
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:44,910
It's just that our villages
are so close, yet we are so different!

737
00:55:51,214 --> 00:55:56,892
Raj Take this broom
and clean up this wall

738
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:00,962
Sure

739
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:07,103
Oh Raj

740
00:56:07,297 --> 00:56:10,642
The flowers have wilted,
please water them

741
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:12,337
OK

742
00:56:16,339 --> 00:56:17,443
Ra]

743
00:56:17,974 --> 00:56:19,885
Can you please make me some tea?

744
00:56:20,009 --> 00:56:21,420
Tea..

745
00:56:35,258 --> 00:56:37,499
Water on plastic flowers.

746
00:56:41,297 --> 00:56:43,607
I thought you would at
least have figured that out

747
00:56:43,867 --> 00:56:48,316
I could even fan you, if you wish

748
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,183
Have you ever done farming?

749
00:56:52,275 --> 00:56:54,551
Just a bit, in my childhood

750
00:56:55,311 --> 00:56:58,121
So many stones piled up here!

751
00:56:58,181 --> 00:57:00,127
Please put them in the tractor trolley

752
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:03,398
I hope these stones are
not meant to kill someone

753
00:57:04,387 --> 00:57:05,593
My lord

754
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:08,962
We build a dam with these stones

755
00:57:09,192 --> 00:57:12,002
So that we can store the water
flowing down from your village

756
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:15,300
Do you know about 're
mineralisation' of the soil?

757
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:17,707
No
Want to know?

758
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:22,808
Careful, you're trampling the radishes

759
00:57:24,507 --> 00:57:25,485
May I uproot one?

760
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:27,215
Sure

761
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,421
Farming is interesting

762
00:57:32,515 --> 00:57:34,017
Very interesting

763
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:37,758
When I studied drip
irrigation in college,

764
00:57:37,854 --> 00:57:41,597
I realised we could grow
rice in the Lower Village

765
00:57:41,925 --> 00:57:45,065
Thats how Haifa oranges
are grown in Israel's desert

766
00:57:45,228 --> 00:57:46,832
Amazing
- Faro

767
00:57:47,096 --> 00:57:48,166
Yes, father

768
00:57:48,264 --> 00:57:51,677
Did you hear? His father
has performed his death ceremony

769
00:57:51,868 --> 00:57:52,539
What?

770
00:57:52,602 --> 00:57:54,548
I am hardly surprised

771
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:58,312
These high caste people
don't care for anyone

772
00:57:58,408 --> 00:58:02,322
For years our ancestors
slaved for them,

773
00:58:02,412 --> 00:58:04,323
did the farming,
All the cleaning

774
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:06,684
They only ruled,
- Papa!

775
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:10,193
It's because of their deeds,
that their land is barren

776
00:58:10,887 --> 00:58:11,888
What king?

777
00:58:11,955 --> 00:58:15,801
The real king is he who has water

778
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:21,267
And today, MLA Kharu
the Wrestler is the real king

779
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:22,867
Papa!

780
00:58:23,466 --> 00:58:24,968
Won't you go to the party office?

781
00:58:25,201 --> 00:58:26,612
Oh yes

782
00:58:29,939 --> 00:58:31,316
Come, let's go

783
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:32,982
Sir

784
00:58:36,546 --> 00:58:41,586
Hard work. Those who work hard,
climb great heights.

785
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:44,422
Start the car
- Sir

786
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:51,689
During the first elections, our party
led the government with a majority

787
00:59:00,003 --> 00:59:05,351
But now, coalitions are in fashion

788
00:59:05,742 --> 00:59:07,312
Not now

789
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:13,419
If this continues, we will
remain a part of coalition only...

790
00:59:13,483 --> 00:59:16,760
in the coming election

791
00:59:19,188 --> 00:59:25,469
Any suggestions how
we get a majority during

792
00:59:25,628 --> 00:59:29,770
the vote of confidence?

793
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:32,612
I'm tired and out of ideas

794
00:59:33,269 --> 00:59:39,242
Poverty, religion and now water.
- What do we do now?

795
00:59:39,676 --> 00:59:42,714
What's up...Will
anyone suggest anything?

796
00:59:42,812 --> 00:59:46,851
Or should we shut shop
and look for a new state?

797
00:59:47,617 --> 00:59:48,960
Madam

798
00:59:49,218 --> 00:59:51,255
I have many ideas

799
00:59:51,454 --> 00:59:53,092
For now, why don't you throw a party'?

800
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:56,396
Sit down! She is talking
about the party situation

801
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:58,572
A party for your brother's engagement

802
00:59:59,562 --> 01:00:00,802
What's your name?

803
01:00:00,863 --> 01:00:02,308
Raj Singhdeo

804
01:00:02,498 --> 01:00:04,444
Singhdeo!

805
01:00:04,534 --> 01:00:05,638
Yes

806
01:00:07,036 --> 01:00:10,381
So tell me mister

807
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:15,286
You have dared to give
an idea before all your seniors

808
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:17,250
What did you mean?

809
01:00:17,347 --> 01:00:18,382
Look, Madam

810
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:23,693
Secularism is the oldest
and most reliable weapon in India

811
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,629
If any party wins by
supporting one religion,

812
01:00:27,824 --> 01:00:30,395
the others won't support it

813
01:00:31,661 --> 01:00:33,004
Can you please explain what you mean?

814
01:00:33,196 --> 01:00:35,972
Now, your brother is getting married

815
01:00:36,265 --> 01:00:40,941
Goddess Bihai is the
oldest temple in our region

816
01:00:42,071 --> 01:00:44,142
Arrange for your
brother's engagement there

817
01:00:44,207 --> 01:00:49,156
Demonstrate your secularism
by inviting people

818
01:00:49,212 --> 01:00:51,317
of all communities

819
01:00:51,714 --> 01:00:53,523
Good suggestion

820
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:54,926
I will think about it

821
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:59,126
Whatever I am today
is because of Kharu Sir

822
01:00:59,222 --> 01:01:04,535
Kharu the Wrestler is keen
to serve the public as an MLA

823
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:06,864
I'd like to announce that...

824
01:01:07,063 --> 01:01:08,974
my brother's engagement ceremony

825
01:01:09,032 --> 01:01:12,980
will be held at Goddess Bihai's temple

826
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:16,673
Where people of all
castes will be invited

827
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:18,815
Madam what are the future plans?

828
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:22,755
We have to devise an election strategy

829
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:26,426
I will inform you once it is finalized

830
01:01:28,384 --> 01:01:31,228
It's the bloody limit!

831
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,523
Just to take revenge on you!

832
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:38,060
Your son has fallen so low that he will
invite the bairi villagers inside our temple

833
01:01:38,461 --> 01:01:39,872
But there is a point

834
01:01:39,929 --> 01:01:43,103
Perhaps that will bring
water to our village

835
01:01:46,169 --> 01:01:50,174
Listen, send Raj Singhdeo in.

836
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:52,853
I want to talk to him
- Yes, Madam

837
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:58,359
We need your co-operation
to implement this policy

838
01:01:59,682 --> 01:02:01,218
Come

839
01:02:01,284 --> 01:02:02,820
Mr Raj Singhdeo, please come in

840
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:04,387
Just a minute

841
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:07,092
We'll talk later

842
01:02:13,863 --> 01:02:16,935
Mr Singhdeo,
I appreciate your suggestion

843
01:02:16,999 --> 01:02:18,376
Thank you

844
01:02:18,468 --> 01:02:20,311
But tell me something

845
01:02:20,636 --> 01:02:25,551
But will your people
in the Upper Village agree?

846
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:30,384
We can find a solution

847
01:02:30,446 --> 01:02:32,756
Find one, then

848
01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:37,159
After all,
politics flows in a king's veins

849
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:42,093
No! Never! Over my dead body!

850
01:02:42,158 --> 01:02:44,638
O Priest, hear me out at least

851
01:02:44,694 --> 01:02:47,766
Listen to selfish people like you?

852
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:50,709
You can not live without your son,

853
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:57,376
Now you're asking me to
uproot my life giving plants?

854
01:02:57,573 --> 01:03:01,544
I will tell everyone
about your dirty tricks

855
01:03:01,644 --> 01:03:05,057
O priest, you should be happy
the temple will be all spruced up

856
01:03:05,148 --> 01:03:08,527
So you want to ruin
all my (marijuana) plants?

857
01:03:08,751 --> 01:03:10,355
Let the couple come

858
01:03:10,419 --> 01:03:16,062
I will curse them. That they
become dogs and bite each other

859
01:03:16,392 --> 01:03:20,738
and no one will never
marry in this village

860
01:03:21,063 --> 01:03:22,838
Anyway there are
hardly any weddings here

861
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:26,678
If I give you three more acres of land

862
01:03:27,036 --> 01:03:29,642
You can grow as much
marijuana as you like!

863
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:34,887
The entire land is barren.
Not a blade of grass grows,

864
01:03:35,411 --> 01:03:37,322
forget marijuana

865
01:03:37,547 --> 01:03:42,189
Priest, Re mineralisation can
make barren lands fertile

866
01:03:42,552 --> 01:03:46,625
Don't worry, I'll organise everything

867
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:49,167
Re min-what?

868
01:03:49,358 --> 01:03:50,336
It's a way to grow weed

869
01:03:50,426 --> 01:03:53,566
Ah, fine

870
01:03:55,231 --> 01:03:59,202
True love...makes
people do strange things

871
01:03:59,769 --> 01:04:02,682
A good lawyer has
turned into a farmer now!

872
01:04:03,906 --> 01:04:05,010
True love?

873
01:04:18,454 --> 01:04:19,831
Long live Amrita Devi!

874
01:04:19,889 --> 01:04:21,562
Long live Amrita Devi!

875
01:04:21,624 --> 01:04:23,001
Long live Amrita Devi!

876
01:04:23,059 --> 01:04:24,367
Long live Amrita Devi!

877
01:04:24,493 --> 01:04:26,097
Long live Amrita Devi!

878
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:27,731
Long live Amrita Devi!

879
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:29,173
Long live Amrita Devi!

880
01:04:29,232 --> 01:04:30,506
Long live Amrita Devi!

881
01:04:31,601 --> 01:04:33,512
Greetings, my lord!

882
01:04:33,936 --> 01:04:34,641
Welcome, Madam

883
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:37,412
Long live The King Singhdeo!

884
01:04:37,473 --> 01:04:40,317
Long live The King Singhdeo!

885
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:42,879
Long live The King Singhdeo!

886
01:04:42,979 --> 01:04:45,858
Long live Kharu the Wrestler

887
01:04:45,948 --> 01:04:48,690
Long live Kharu the Wrestler

888
01:04:48,751 --> 01:04:51,322
Say, long live Goddess Bihai!

889
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:53,424
Say, long live Goddess Bihai!

890
01:04:53,522 --> 01:04:55,866
Say, long live Goddess Bihai!

891
01:04:56,025 --> 01:04:58,562
Say, long live Goddess Bihai!

892
01:04:58,628 --> 01:05:01,404
Say, long live Goddess Bihai!

893
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:04,476
Do you see Kharu's arrogance, my lord?

894
01:05:05,167 --> 01:05:06,646
He is lost

895
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:26,896
Long live Goddess Bihai

896
01:05:26,989 --> 01:05:28,991
Long live Goddess Bihai

897
01:05:29,058 --> 01:05:31,766
Long live Goddess Bihai

898
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:37,737
I always knew that royal
blood flows in your veins

899
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:39,140
What a thing you pulled off!

900
01:05:39,235 --> 01:05:40,179
Bearer!
- Yes, my lord

901
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:41,509
A double peg for the Prince

902
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:42,844
No

903
01:05:44,006 --> 01:05:45,986
Come on, drink
Pour it

904
01:05:46,642 --> 01:05:47,950
Drink drink

905
01:05:48,978 --> 01:05:54,860
Dad, I was thinking,
do we really need to sell the land?

906
01:05:57,153 --> 01:05:58,393
Meaning?

907
01:05:58,587 --> 01:06:02,694
Thanks to the temple, we have
already got three months' water supply

908
01:06:02,892 --> 01:06:06,203
If this continues,
our circumstances could get much better

909
01:06:08,331 --> 01:06:13,474
Is it Kharu's daughter
who is brainwashing you?

910
01:06:13,669 --> 01:06:15,580
Don't drag her in

911
01:06:16,172 --> 01:06:17,810
I'm speaking my own mind

912
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:22,611
All I'm saying is we
must have the power to decide

913
01:06:22,712 --> 01:06:24,123
whether to sell the land or not

914
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:26,217
No, I will sell it for sure

915
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:28,560
But now

916
01:06:28,951 --> 01:06:32,558
I won't sell either to these
businessmen, or to the foreigners

917
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:34,824
Now I will sell it directly to Obama

918
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:37,427
Who is Oba...ma?

919
01:06:37,793 --> 01:06:40,399
Obama bin Laden. He's a big shot

920
01:06:40,596 --> 01:06:44,305
Forget everything.
Just get me his number

921
01:07:06,822 --> 01:07:09,268
I'm sister of Fiavan,
King of Lanka

922
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:12,499
I'm very beautiful

923
01:07:12,728 --> 01:07:17,473
My brother Khardushan
lives in the forest

924
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,973
I'm Surpanakha

925
01:07:20,302 --> 01:07:22,407
Why have you come here?

926
01:07:22,638 --> 01:07:24,709
I want to marry you

927
01:07:25,007 --> 01:07:28,784
Hey, beautiful,
go to my brother Lakshman

928
01:07:29,178 --> 01:07:31,454
He will marry you

929
01:07:32,148 --> 01:07:33,491
ok

930
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:40,166
Will you marry me'?

931
01:07:40,856 --> 01:07:44,360
Hey, beautiful, go back to my brother

932
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:47,302
But he sent me to you himself

933
01:07:49,098 --> 01:07:51,601
OK, please sit down

934
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:58,343
Look there

935
01:08:00,443 --> 01:08:01,922
Look there

936
01:08:07,049 --> 01:08:10,553
Oh god! You've cut my nose!

937
01:08:13,189 --> 01:08:15,795
Oh god! You've cut my nose!

938
01:08:19,528 --> 01:08:21,872
Oh god! You've cut my nose!

939
01:08:23,065 --> 01:08:24,237
Faro

940
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:32,578
Faro

941
01:08:33,843 --> 01:08:35,845
Lost your voice at the play?

942
01:08:37,446 --> 01:08:39,517
And what did you leave
behind at the play?

943
01:08:40,316 --> 01:08:42,318
Today's play was particularly
exciting, wasn't it?

944
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:44,723
What do you mean?

945
01:08:45,387 --> 01:08:47,196
I saw everything today

946
01:08:48,324 --> 01:08:49,894
What are you saying?
- Don't pretend

947
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:51,531
I saw you today

948
01:08:51,727 --> 01:08:53,104
What did you see?

949
01:08:54,230 --> 01:08:56,039
I saw you with her

950
01:08:57,199 --> 01:08:58,644
With whom, Faro?

951
01:08:59,268 --> 01:09:01,111
"How are you, my Prince?"

952
01:09:01,937 --> 01:09:03,780
Oh, you mean Gulapi!
- Gulapi!

953
01:09:04,073 --> 01:09:05,347
So you know her name, too

954
01:09:05,441 --> 01:09:07,785
Obviously, she's from my village.
I know her since my childhood days

955
01:09:07,843 --> 01:09:08,913
From childhood?

956
01:09:09,912 --> 01:09:11,289
What else have you seen, Raj'?

957
01:09:11,514 --> 01:09:13,516
You're twisting everything I say

958
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:16,655
I should have listened to my father

959
01:09:16,886 --> 01:09:19,162
Listened to what?
- I should have listened to him

960
01:09:19,522 --> 01:09:22,128
You are a king only in name.
But you are such a wretch!

961
01:09:22,358 --> 01:09:23,996
I was crazy.

962
01:09:24,059 --> 01:09:26,096
I thought you were from
the Upper Village, and different

963
01:09:26,262 --> 01:09:27,400
because you had been to the city

964
01:09:27,496 --> 01:09:28,497
Why are you talking about caste now?

965
01:09:28,564 --> 01:09:30,066
But I was wrong.
And I helped you so much, Raj!

966
01:09:30,132 --> 01:09:32,043
Of course, you did!

967
01:09:32,101 --> 01:09:33,580
From day one,
I cooked for you, cleaned up.

968
01:09:33,636 --> 01:09:35,445
In fact, you helped not only me,
but my entire village

969
01:09:35,538 --> 01:09:37,040
What did you do for me'?

970
01:09:37,106 --> 01:09:40,849
What are you saying?
- You think you did us favour by allowing

971
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:47,156
us into Goddess Bihai's temple?
- Listen to me, Faro! This is weird

972
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:48,194
Yes, I'm weird

973
01:09:48,284 --> 01:09:49,558
Why are you talking like this?

974
01:09:49,652 --> 01:09:51,063
It's no use

975
01:09:51,387 --> 01:09:53,230
Faro, please listen to me

976
01:09:59,128 --> 01:10:03,076
Sorry, Faro. I'm so sorry

977
01:10:04,433 --> 01:10:06,413
Faro. I'm so sorry

978
01:10:38,434 --> 01:10:43,434
You are so close to me, that you have
blended into all the grooves in my soul

979
01:10:50,546 --> 01:10:55,546
Whatever the question may be,
You are the answer to all of them

980
01:11:05,661 --> 01:11:11,407
I was lost in thought

981
01:11:11,467 --> 01:11:17,509
Without you, where do I stand

982
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:23,689
At this time of life

983
01:11:23,979 --> 01:11:29,759
Without you,
Where does the night end

984
01:11:30,019 --> 01:11:35,901
Your spell urges me to stop

985
01:11:36,558 --> 01:11:42,201
I cant see anything but you

986
01:11:42,731 --> 01:11:48,443
Sometimes you sneak up on me

987
01:11:48,771 --> 01:11:54,585
It feels like magic
scattered around me

988
01:11:54,810 --> 01:12:00,453
I was lost in thought

989
01:12:00,683 --> 01:12:07,066
When you're not in my heart,
my breath stops

990
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:13,035
I see only you in my dreams

991
01:12:13,362 --> 01:12:19,745
Without you,
What memory is there for me'?

992
01:12:19,968 --> 01:12:25,941
You're there there,
You're there there, you

993
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:31,175
You're there there,
You're there there, you

994
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:44,666
You're there there,
You're there there, you

995
01:12:52,167 --> 01:12:58,641
I will give a feast.
A very large feast.

996
01:12:59,975 --> 01:13:02,819
I will invite 85 priests

997
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:07,653
I will dance and sing with everyone

998
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:12,490
Long live Jagannath!

999
01:13:16,759 --> 01:13:19,706
My Prince has really grown up

1000
01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:25,437
I raised him, educated him

1001
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:27,676
He returns to the village
and what does he do?

1002
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:33,114
He becomes a servant of Kharu!

1003
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:36,818
What are you saying?

1004
01:13:36,979 --> 01:13:38,890
Give me back all the money

1005
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:42,187
That I spent on your education.

1006
01:13:42,351 --> 01:13:44,991
You rascal,
you go and write Kharu's speech

1007
01:13:45,053 --> 01:13:47,329
But you can't hear me barking

1008
01:13:47,389 --> 01:13:48,925
What are you doing? Keep quiet

1009
01:13:49,158 --> 01:13:53,334
People will hear us
Should everyone know?

1010
01:13:53,395 --> 01:13:57,901
There's no one here Even
if I strangle you, nobody would know

1011
01:13:58,233 --> 01:14:00,440
Has anyone ever heard
me out in this house?

1012
01:14:09,678 --> 01:14:11,919
What I'm saying is...

1013
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:14,017
Come on, wear your clothes now

1014
01:14:14,249 --> 01:14:17,526
You're looking weird

1015
01:14:28,564 --> 01:14:30,043
Give it

1016
01:14:36,205 --> 01:14:38,151
Can I tell you something,
my Prince?

1017
01:14:39,107 --> 01:14:41,246
Don't mind my saying so

1018
01:14:43,612 --> 01:14:45,888
In our entire royal lineage...

1019
01:14:47,216 --> 01:14:50,197
No one has been born
as useless as you

1020
01:14:53,722 --> 01:14:54,860
See

1021
01:14:55,257 --> 01:14:56,702
See

1022
01:14:58,093 --> 01:15:01,506
See what they've replied

1023
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:06,404
They say that my letter has no value

1024
01:15:08,637 --> 01:15:10,776
I also have no value

1025
01:15:12,908 --> 01:15:15,514
Do something, son

1026
01:15:17,012 --> 01:15:20,550
Do something, son or else

1027
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:22,992
Or forget about being kings,

1028
01:15:23,051 --> 01:15:25,088
we won't even be fit
to be commoners

1029
01:15:27,389 --> 01:15:30,859
Please do something

1030
01:15:32,394 --> 01:15:35,967
Only you will be able
to fix everything.

1031
01:15:36,565 --> 01:15:38,567
Please do something

1032
01:16:06,328 --> 01:16:09,400
We don't even have water
to wash our ass

1033
01:16:09,464 --> 01:16:10,204
Correct

1034
01:16:10,265 --> 01:16:13,644
If the Lower Village is kept
busy with such festivals, we can

1035
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:16,712
Keep getting water like this

1036
01:16:29,851 --> 01:16:36,496
The grains of rice have
reached the feet of the Lord

1037
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:46,947
But the journey behind
its success was much longer

1038
01:17:12,194 --> 01:17:18,201
Oh..Color'ful girl..
Oh..Color'ful girl..

1039
01:17:18,567 --> 01:17:24,916
Without you all colors
would only be white

1040
01:17:25,207 --> 01:17:30,623
Without you the fields
wouldn't be green

1041
01:17:30,679 --> 01:17:36,357
Colorful girl..
I am the colorful girl

1042
01:17:36,451 --> 01:17:43,665
Without you there wouldn't
be any love storms

1043
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:49,374
Look at all these groups
of devotees

1044
01:17:49,431 --> 01:17:52,878
They will fill
colored water in your honour

1045
01:17:53,201 --> 01:17:56,273
Colorful girl..

1046
01:18:20,062 --> 01:18:23,043
Your words are like
honey and feel true

1047
01:18:23,098 --> 01:18:26,045
While the others are
dry and feel fake

1048
01:18:26,101 --> 01:18:29,241
Your words are like
honey and feel true

1049
01:18:29,304 --> 01:18:31,978
While the others are
dry and feel fake

1050
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:35,019
My heart beats when
you dance for me

1051
01:18:35,177 --> 01:18:38,021
The others when dance
are strangers for me

1052
01:18:38,246 --> 01:18:41,159
My feet move like grass in winds

1053
01:18:41,216 --> 01:18:44,220
My hands grace like sandalwood

1054
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:47,232
In your devotion I feel divine

1055
01:18:47,322 --> 01:18:51,134
How can I ever dare to forget you

1056
01:18:51,193 --> 01:18:54,037
Colorful girl..

1057
01:18:58,633 --> 01:19:06,484
Colorful girl..

1058
01:19:11,446 --> 01:19:13,983
Come here, my little mouse!

1059
01:19:14,449 --> 01:19:16,520
Now it's your turn

1060
01:19:17,052 --> 01:19:20,795
Go on, get inside

1061
01:19:21,456 --> 01:19:22,696
Dig hard

1062
01:19:22,858 --> 01:19:26,567
Go on
Dig hard

1063
01:19:29,331 --> 01:19:30,537
Dig hard

1064
01:19:33,635 --> 01:19:35,080
I am about to leave.

1065
01:19:35,303 --> 01:19:37,977
Little Prince, take out the jeep,
we have to go to town.

1066
01:19:38,073 --> 01:19:39,916
I won't be able
to make it today.

1067
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:41,318
Why?

1068
01:19:41,409 --> 01:19:43,082
I have to got to the
party office in town.

1069
01:19:43,478 --> 01:19:44,821
With whose permission?

1070
01:19:45,113 --> 01:19:47,684
Madam had called me
to make a presentation

1071
01:19:48,884 --> 01:19:49,885
0K6)'

1072
01:19:51,186 --> 01:19:55,498
In future you will not speak
to Amrita Devi without my permission.

1073
01:19:57,325 --> 01:19:58,668
Yes MLA Sir

1074
01:19:59,427 --> 01:20:02,237
Good job, Raj

1075
01:20:02,497 --> 01:20:05,535
I see you worked
hard on the presentation

1076
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:07,045
Thank you, Ma'am

1077
01:20:08,270 --> 01:20:09,442
Please have some

1078
01:20:09,704 --> 01:20:10,808
Thank you

1079
01:20:11,106 --> 01:20:15,179
Ma'am, I wanted to talk
to you about the Upper Village

1080
01:20:16,278 --> 01:20:17,689
Yes, go on

1081
01:20:18,747 --> 01:20:21,455
Look, for the last 3O years,

1082
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:25,226
There's been migration,
drought, famine

1083
01:20:26,021 --> 01:20:27,295
In the Upper Village,
whatever be the reasons

1084
01:20:27,355 --> 01:20:28,993
But in the Lower Village nearby,
there's water

1085
01:20:30,158 --> 01:20:32,263
A lot can be done, if you wish

1086
01:20:36,164 --> 01:20:39,805
Your father has always
kept me at a distance

1087
01:20:41,403 --> 01:20:42,609
Look, Raj,

1088
01:20:42,871 --> 01:20:47,217
if I get busy sorting
out such internal troubles,

1089
01:20:47,275 --> 01:20:49,221
How will I manage
such a big state?

1090
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:54,954
And water politics
is the most crucial today

1091
01:20:57,018 --> 01:21:00,898
But I'm sure if we
put our heads together now

1092
01:21:01,122 --> 01:21:04,535
We can find a solution

1093
01:21:05,794 --> 01:21:06,772
Coffee?

1094
01:21:17,038 --> 01:21:20,815
How calm this water is

1095
01:21:23,979 --> 01:21:25,117
But it's for this very water that

1096
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:30,452
There is so much fighting,
politics and lies

1097
01:21:32,487 --> 01:21:35,058
In fact, this water is the
cause of enmity between our villages

1098
01:21:36,825 --> 01:21:40,534
We're neighbours,
yet we're so far apart

1099
01:21:42,597 --> 01:21:48,411
We cannot even ask forgiveness
for our ancestors' mistakes

1100
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:50,072
What are you saying, Raj!

1101
01:21:51,606 --> 01:21:53,210
What are you saying, Raj!

1102
01:21:54,142 --> 01:21:55,746
It is also our fault

1103
01:21:56,278 --> 01:21:58,121
We have so much water,

1104
01:21:58,280 --> 01:21:59,725
but at your place,
water has already become currency

1105
01:21:59,814 --> 01:22:01,885
Neither are we solving the problem,
nor letting others do so

1106
01:22:06,521 --> 01:22:08,967
When will all this end, Faro?

1107
01:22:12,193 --> 01:22:13,103
No

1108
01:22:15,664 --> 01:22:16,972
Never

1109
01:22:25,507 --> 01:22:26,781
Ra]

1110
01:22:30,412 --> 01:22:34,053
Perhaps this will break the wall,
and end the water problem

1111
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:55,812
The electricity guys
have cut the power again

1112
01:22:57,906 --> 01:22:59,385
They are very kind

1113
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:04,854
We haven't paid the bill
for three years

1114
01:23:07,482 --> 01:23:10,156
Still they give us
power occasionally

1115
01:23:16,424 --> 01:23:17,334
Bearer!

1116
01:23:17,392 --> 01:23:18,530
Yes, my lord

1117
01:23:19,794 --> 01:23:25,642
When there's no electricity,
the sky is so clear

1118
01:23:26,034 --> 01:23:27,172
Yes, my lord

1119
01:23:28,503 --> 01:23:33,475
When the darkness grows,
the stars shine brighter too

1120
01:23:43,184 --> 01:23:44,686
Father, water has come

1121
01:23:44,753 --> 01:23:46,699
What?
- Water has come

1122
01:24:00,068 --> 01:24:01,376
WOW!

1123
01:24:01,669 --> 01:24:08,814
Now I will sell the water
and become a millionaire

1124
01:24:13,181 --> 01:24:16,060
My lord,
the Lower Village starts from here

1125
01:24:16,284 --> 01:24:17,763
It would not be right to proceed

1126
01:24:17,819 --> 01:24:20,129
It doesn't matter, let's go

1127
01:24:20,288 --> 01:24:23,167
My lord, someone is coming

1128
01:24:25,093 --> 01:24:27,596
Has he gone?
- He must have, my lord

1129
01:24:31,733 --> 01:24:33,735
Check if he's gone

1130
01:24:37,472 --> 01:24:39,110
I can't see anything

1131
01:24:39,607 --> 01:24:40,915
OK

1132
01:24:42,744 --> 01:24:43,984
Not now

1133
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:46,252
Why isn't he going?

1134
01:24:46,581 --> 01:24:50,358
I think he's also wondering
why we haven't gone

1135
01:24:50,819 --> 01:24:51,763
Ask him who he is

1136
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:54,494
You want me to ask'?
- You think I'll ask'?

1137
01:24:56,291 --> 01:24:58,897
Who is it?

1138
01:25:01,463 --> 01:25:03,943
What are you guys doing here?

1139
01:25:05,333 --> 01:25:08,507
What should I do?

1140
01:25:09,037 --> 01:25:11,540
You keep disconnecting my calls

1141
01:25:11,606 --> 01:25:13,142
And there's no news
of you in the last four days

1142
01:25:13,208 --> 01:25:16,314
I was just coming to give you the news
- Someone's coming

1143
01:25:25,787 --> 01:25:27,767
Oh, it's Bhulia

1144
01:25:28,990 --> 01:25:31,493
What the hell is he doing here?

1145
01:25:31,593 --> 01:25:35,598
Shall I ask him'?
- Forget it!

1146
01:25:36,030 --> 01:25:39,341
Now I know where this
idiot is digging his well

1147
01:25:39,734 --> 01:25:42,044
10...20...3O

1148
01:25:42,137 --> 01:25:45,744
Anyway, you tell me,
is your news good or bad?

1149
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:46,910
Superb news!

1150
01:25:47,008 --> 01:25:48,214
So you did it?

1151
01:25:48,309 --> 01:25:49,219
My lord, he has left

1152
01:25:49,277 --> 01:25:53,453
I always knew you are royal blood

1153
01:25:53,515 --> 01:25:54,994
Now watch.
When that bloody Kharu comes

1154
01:25:55,049 --> 01:25:56,392
I'll humiliate him
before the entire village

1155
01:25:56,451 --> 01:25:57,725
Dad, it's something else

1156
01:25:57,819 --> 01:26:00,026
What else can it be?

1157
01:26:00,088 --> 01:26:01,624
In three months, when her tummy <i>shows,</i>

1158
01:26:01,723 --> 01:26:03,396
Kharu will come begging
to get her married

1159
01:26:03,491 --> 01:26:05,471
Dad, I'm getting married
- Someone is coming

1160
01:26:08,863 --> 01:26:10,433
You're getting married?

1161
01:26:12,267 --> 01:26:13,302
Why?

1162
01:26:13,601 --> 01:26:14,841
Because I love her

1163
01:26:21,543 --> 01:26:23,784
Bloody bastards

1164
01:26:24,579 --> 01:26:27,992
Did I send you there to screw her,
or fall in love?

1165
01:26:28,082 --> 01:26:30,062
You sent me to make
arrangements for water

1166
01:26:30,251 --> 01:26:31,889
And I'm doing that

1167
01:26:31,953 --> 01:26:34,900
What the heck!
You've ruined all our plans

1168
01:26:34,989 --> 01:26:37,265
Why does everything
need to follow a plan, Dad?

1169
01:26:37,559 --> 01:26:40,836
And if everything is getting solved,
why do you Need a plan?

1170
01:26:43,731 --> 01:26:45,005
My lord, he has left

1171
01:26:45,066 --> 01:26:47,740
Bearer, has he gone mad?

1172
01:26:47,802 --> 01:26:48,780
Ask him

1173
01:26:48,937 --> 01:26:49,813
What are you doing?

1174
01:26:50,038 --> 01:26:52,382
Will you marry that low caste girl?

1175
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:53,646
You don't believe in caste, right?

1176
01:26:53,741 --> 01:26:56,051
I don't believe in
caste but in circumstances

1177
01:26:56,110 --> 01:26:57,851
But you don't understand
our circumstances

1178
01:26:57,946 --> 01:26:59,186
We are ruined!

1179
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:00,725
Dad, why don't you understand?

1180
01:27:01,015 --> 01:27:04,485
If both villages unite,
All our problems would be solved

1181
01:27:04,552 --> 01:27:07,795
So, will you break
the 3O year old wall?

1182
01:27:07,855 --> 01:27:10,495
When we have built the wall,
we should break it!

1183
01:27:10,692 --> 01:27:11,966
It's not you.

1184
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:14,106
It's your (dead) aunt
speaking from within you

1185
01:27:14,195 --> 01:27:16,835
OK, so kill me,
the way you killed her

1186
01:27:20,568 --> 01:27:21,876
Nothing has changed,

1187
01:27:22,604 --> 01:27:24,345
nothing ever will

1188
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:28,284
But I will do whatever I have to

1189
01:27:34,182 --> 01:27:35,525
Sure.

1190
01:27:36,484 --> 01:27:38,486
Then I will also
do whatever I have to do

1191
01:27:38,686 --> 01:27:39,687
Bearer!
- Yes, my lord

1192
01:27:39,787 --> 01:27:40,959
Phone

1193
01:27:41,189 --> 01:27:43,567
For that, We'll have to go home
- Let's go

1194
01:27:43,825 --> 01:27:45,168
Leave it.

1195
01:28:04,646 --> 01:28:07,593
Sir, listen to me

1196
01:28:07,749 --> 01:28:11,390
Now only,
the people's rights will be honoured

1197
01:28:11,586 --> 01:28:15,056
I will burn your father's
kingdom to ashes.

1198
01:28:15,123 --> 01:28:18,593
Papa

1199
01:28:21,596 --> 01:28:23,667
I've seen it with my own eyes.

1200
01:28:23,831 --> 01:28:26,243
I was about to take a photo
But he escaped into a lane

1201
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:31,307
You rotten Scoundrel!
You never bring good news

1202
01:28:31,406 --> 01:28:33,249
Why blame me, my lord?

1203
01:28:33,775 --> 01:28:37,279
The Prince himself wants
to marry the bairi girl

1204
01:28:37,378 --> 01:28:42,418
I've seen him with
a ring Going towards her

1205
01:28:42,817 --> 01:28:44,160
What is my fault

1206
01:28:44,419 --> 01:28:48,595
We have a long tradition of ruining
our reputations with those villagers

1207
01:28:48,890 --> 01:28:53,100
But we won't allow their daughter
to become our daughter-in-law

1208
01:28:53,194 --> 01:28:54,138
Is it right?

1209
01:28:54,195 --> 01:28:55,105
No,

1210
01:28:55,196 --> 01:28:57,767
No, we won't allow it

1211
01:28:58,199 --> 01:29:01,339
Quiet!

1212
01:29:01,769 --> 01:29:05,410
We won't allow that bairi girl to come
to our village as our daughter in law

1213
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:07,811
We will all stop her

1214
01:29:07,909 --> 01:29:10,082
Yes, we will stop her

1215
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:14,490
But before we do so,
the priest should bless us

1216
01:29:14,582 --> 01:29:15,993
Priest, bless them!

1217
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:18,287
Blessed!

1218
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:21,061
Bless them properly.

1219
01:29:21,389 --> 01:29:25,997
Sure
Listen, no one will touch the prince.

1220
01:29:26,060 --> 01:29:29,507
If anyone touches him Goddess
Bihai's curse will fall upon him.

1221
01:29:29,564 --> 01:29:31,771
After all, he's our own prince, OK?

1222
01:29:31,833 --> 01:29:34,575
Yes, he's our own prince

1223
01:29:35,203 --> 01:29:39,083
Chief, he's our own prince, right?

1224
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:42,451
Yes, no one will touch
the prince. Get it?

1225
01:29:42,543 --> 01:29:45,285
We will go and stop her,

1226
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:47,582
but no one will touch the prince,

1227
01:29:47,782 --> 01:29:50,194
As the priest and
village chief have said

1228
01:29:50,284 --> 01:29:51,957
Let's go
- Come on, let's go

1229
01:29:53,221 --> 01:29:56,498
Listen to me, Kharu!
Everybody knows about it

1230
01:29:56,758 --> 01:29:58,738
Don't do anything in a fit of rage

1231
01:30:08,770 --> 01:30:11,216
Uncle, everyone who has heard
the news in the village ls angry

1232
01:30:11,372 --> 01:30:14,581
They are all coming
- Uncle, he has insulted us

1233
01:30:15,476 --> 01:30:20,619
Hail lord Ram!

1234
01:30:20,848 --> 01:30:23,260
Shit.

1235
01:30:27,054 --> 01:30:28,499
Faro
- Raj

1236
01:30:43,771 --> 01:30:44,579
Faro

1237
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:47,643
Come on, hurry up, kids

1238
01:30:53,381 --> 01:30:55,019
Raj, that way..

1239
01:30:57,618 --> 01:30:59,620
Faro... this way

1240
01:31:00,455 --> 01:31:05,666
Who are you?
Where are you from, monkey?

1241
01:31:05,993 --> 01:31:09,202
Why did you ruin the
garden of Lanka's king?

1242
01:31:09,430 --> 01:31:11,910
What do you wish?

1243
01:31:12,233 --> 01:31:15,737
Tell the king of Lanka

1244
01:31:16,037 --> 01:31:19,075
Come on, let's go

1245
01:31:19,707 --> 01:31:21,880
Come on, let's go
Hail lord Ram!

1246
01:31:21,943 --> 01:31:27,655
Lord Fiamchandra told Goddess Sita

1247
01:31:27,915 --> 01:31:33,490
Lord Fiamchandra told Goddess Sita

1248
01:31:33,754 --> 01:31:38,032
Doomsday will be upon us

1249
01:31:38,326 --> 01:31:40,431
O Priest

1250
01:31:41,195 --> 01:31:42,697
Tell me something...

1251
01:31:43,064 --> 01:31:46,238
when you smoke up,
you fly towards heaven

1252
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:48,913
But what's your real weight on earth?

1253
01:31:49,403 --> 01:31:51,383
No problem, my lord

1254
01:31:51,572 --> 01:31:53,779
I've already done the calculations

1255
01:31:55,076 --> 01:31:57,113
The swan will peck on grains

1256
01:31:57,345 --> 01:32:01,953
Lord, My family has served
your kingdom well for generations

1257
01:32:02,583 --> 01:32:06,827
Those who have worked
hard will always be rewarded

1258
01:32:06,888 --> 01:32:10,961
And the crow will feast on pearls

1259
01:32:12,927 --> 01:32:14,600
O lord, please forgive me

1260
01:32:14,695 --> 01:32:17,335
I won't be able to do all this

1261
01:32:18,933 --> 01:32:20,879
What about your digging?

1262
01:32:20,935 --> 01:32:24,041
I'm just digging a small well.

1263
01:32:24,138 --> 01:32:26,482
Anyway where's the
water in this village?

1264
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:28,578
No, no, not the well

1265
01:32:28,910 --> 01:32:33,052
What about the tunnel you are digging?
Where has that reached?

1266
01:32:33,614 --> 01:32:39,565
Listen, who is digging
and who is screwing...

1267
01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:42,824
Ultimately the king
knows everything...

1268
01:32:43,591 --> 01:32:48,438
So the crow will feast on pearls

1269
01:32:49,797 --> 01:32:51,401
As you say, my lord

1270
01:32:53,067 --> 01:32:54,341
Now Paplu?

1271
01:32:54,402 --> 01:32:56,575
My lord,
we have already ordered the motor

1272
01:32:56,637 --> 01:33:05,990
The swan will peck on grains,
and the crow will feast on pearls

1273
01:33:08,082 --> 01:33:10,187
Hello, Haan madam

1274
01:33:10,251 --> 01:33:12,197
Raj, listen to me carefully.

1275
01:33:14,789 --> 01:33:17,963
You go straight to
Goddess Bihai's temple

1276
01:33:18,793 --> 01:33:21,501
But they will kill my Faro

1277
01:33:21,729 --> 01:33:24,073
son...nothing will happen to you

1278
01:33:24,131 --> 01:33:26,441
just reach the temple,
things will be arranged

1279
01:33:26,534 --> 01:33:29,105
Goddess Bihai's temple? OK

1280
01:33:35,576 --> 01:33:39,956
Hail lord Ram!

1281
01:33:54,729 --> 01:34:00,441
Hail lord Ram!

1282
01:34:10,845 --> 01:34:12,620
They are hiding in
the temple...go there

1283
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:14,887
You are a true warrior, my lord!

1284
01:34:15,316 --> 01:34:17,455
We salute your sense of justice

1285
01:34:17,785 --> 01:34:19,856
We're all reaching the temple

1286
01:34:21,288 --> 01:34:24,030
Come on, let's go to the temple.

1287
01:34:24,158 --> 01:34:30,473
Hail Goddess Bihai

1288
01:34:37,138 --> 01:34:39,049
Kharu
- I will not spare them

1289
01:34:39,106 --> 01:34:41,313
Kharu, go straight to the temple

1290
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:46,215
Raj is hiding at the Bihai
ma temple with your daughter

1291
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:48,282
Yes, Madam, as you wish

1292
01:34:48,382 --> 01:34:50,988
We will burn them to ashes today

1293
01:34:51,052 --> 01:34:59,301
Long live Lord Ram

1294
01:35:03,397 --> 01:35:04,967
Are you OK?

1295
01:35:07,735 --> 01:35:09,043
Come on, hurry

1296
01:35:11,105 --> 01:35:14,848
Long live Lord Ram

1297
01:35:15,443 --> 01:35:17,354
We are not weak today

1298
01:35:17,545 --> 01:35:19,718
Today, we will avenge Dora's death

1299
01:35:19,814 --> 01:35:21,657
Long live Lord Ram

1300
01:35:21,716 --> 01:35:24,856
Raj, these people have
already reached here.

1301
01:35:25,086 --> 01:35:27,896
What will happen now?
Where is Amrita Devi?

1302
01:35:28,155 --> 01:35:31,602
I will call her don't worry Faro

1303
01:35:32,860 --> 01:35:36,467
Ha, ha! The lovebirds are hiding here

1304
01:35:37,298 --> 01:35:39,437
Come and catch them

1305
01:35:40,301 --> 01:35:43,248
Long live Lord Ram

1306
01:35:45,940 --> 01:35:47,476
Uncle Kharu,

1307
01:35:47,541 --> 01:35:51,580
Uncle Kharu, we've found both of them

1308
01:35:52,313 --> 01:35:53,815
"Dhare!"

1309
01:35:54,281 --> 01:35:55,453
Hold him!

1310
01:35:55,883 --> 01:35:57,521
We will bury him in his own land today

1311
01:35:57,585 --> 01:36:02,728
Long live Lord Ram

1312
01:36:14,568 --> 01:36:15,672
Faro

1313
01:36:45,065 --> 01:36:48,842
Whoever touches these two will die

1314
01:36:49,069 --> 01:36:52,676
No one can stand
in the way of true love

1315
01:36:52,907 --> 01:36:56,787
Instead of water,
you had soaked the land with blood

1316
01:36:56,944 --> 01:37:01,154
That's why I cursed your
land with drought For three decades

1317
01:37:01,215 --> 01:37:05,129
If you spill the blood
of these children on my doorstep

1318
01:37:05,186 --> 01:37:09,464
You will not escape my
curse for the next 300 years

1319
01:37:09,523 --> 01:37:12,936
But Goddess! These two have sinned

1320
01:37:13,127 --> 01:37:16,108
When God himself
has accepted this couple

1321
01:37:16,197 --> 01:37:19,974
Who are you,
mere humans, to deny them?

1322
01:37:20,568 --> 01:37:24,482
Who are you,
mere humans, to deny them?

1323
01:37:24,705 --> 01:37:28,482
Stop this fight between high
and low castes once and for all

1324
01:37:28,976 --> 01:37:32,355
If you live together in harmony
both the villages will prosper

1325
01:37:32,613 --> 01:37:36,618
So stop violence and
speak the language of love

1326
01:37:36,684 --> 01:37:38,721
Goddess, we will follow your orders

1327
01:37:38,853 --> 01:37:40,560
Please don't be angry with us

1328
01:37:40,654 --> 01:37:43,692
We are illiterate fools,
but these two are sinners

1329
01:37:43,757 --> 01:37:47,933
Who are you to decide
sinners and saints?

1330
01:37:48,128 --> 01:37:52,577
My trident will pierce your
chest and silence you forever

1331
01:37:52,633 --> 01:37:55,978
Lord have mercy!

1332
01:37:57,304 --> 01:37:59,511
Kharu the Wrestler fears no one

1333
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:01,717
I don't believe in this farce

1334
01:38:01,775 --> 01:38:05,018
Go catch him!

1335
01:38:14,588 --> 01:38:18,365
Don't test the patience of the goddess

1336
01:38:18,525 --> 01:38:22,098
Or I won't be able to stop myself

1337
01:38:22,329 --> 01:38:25,276
Don't challenge the goddess, you fool!

1338
01:38:25,532 --> 01:38:26,806
Or it will be...doomsday!

1339
01:38:26,901 --> 01:38:32,317
No, goddess! Have mercy

1340
01:38:36,644 --> 01:38:41,992
Long live Goddess Bihai!

1341
01:38:42,516 --> 01:38:45,463
O Goddess!
I'm the leader of these people

1342
01:38:45,519 --> 01:38:48,830
And want to apologise on their behalf

1343
01:38:50,157 --> 01:38:54,367
Brothers, we want to
calm the angry goddess, right?

1344
01:38:54,428 --> 01:38:55,498
Yes

1345
01:38:55,562 --> 01:38:56,905
Say it louder

1346
01:38:56,964 --> 01:38:58,102
Yes!

1347
01:38:58,198 --> 01:39:02,305
Goddess,
We all promise you that...

1348
01:39:02,469 --> 01:39:06,007
between the Upper and
Lower Villages you will find...

1349
01:39:06,206 --> 01:39:10,484
the same sweetness
as these temple bells ring

1350
01:39:10,544 --> 01:39:12,046
Agreed, should I tell her?

1351
01:39:12,112 --> 01:39:13,352
Yes

1352
01:39:13,414 --> 01:39:17,021
No, no!
Kharu the Wrestler objects

1353
01:39:17,484 --> 01:39:20,556
This is not right

1354
01:39:20,654 --> 01:39:25,034
When God, the villagers and
your daughter have accepted him

1355
01:39:25,092 --> 01:39:26,935
Who are you to object?

1356
01:39:27,161 --> 01:39:29,004
Please be quiet

1357
01:39:29,063 --> 01:39:31,566
Or the next spear will make me a widow

1358
01:39:31,632 --> 01:39:33,441
Stop being stubborn, Kharu

1359
01:39:33,567 --> 01:39:35,774
They are our children only

1360
01:39:38,272 --> 01:39:39,512
Papa

1361
01:40:12,940 --> 01:40:17,616
Long live Goddess Bihai!

1362
01:40:17,678 --> 01:40:21,854
See how these two blush!

1363
01:40:22,049 --> 01:40:26,191
Now both the villages will prosper

1364
01:40:26,820 --> 01:40:29,198
You wanted to kill them

1365
01:40:29,256 --> 01:40:32,829
But it is because of his
efforts That you have water today

1366
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:39,475
Just as, in mythology, Bhagirath
brought the river Gangs. to earth

1367
01:40:39,566 --> 01:40:40,476
Start.

1368
01:40:51,945 --> 01:40:55,791
Long live Goddess Bihai

1369
01:40:55,883 --> 01:40:58,693
Long live Goddess Bihai

1370
01:40:58,752 --> 01:41:00,561
Long live Goddess Bihai

1371
01:41:00,654 --> 01:41:03,260
Long live Goddess Bihai

1372
01:41:15,135 --> 01:41:19,447
It's a new world,
a new start, a new generation

1373
01:41:21,508 --> 01:41:24,512
In the name of the goddess,

1374
01:41:24,778 --> 01:41:30,456
I announce a new MLA
candidate for this area

1375
01:41:31,318 --> 01:41:34,322
Prince Raj Singhdeo

1376
01:41:34,521 --> 01:41:37,661
Say, 'Long live Amrita Devi'

1377
01:41:37,724 --> 01:41:39,863
Say, 'Long live Amrita Devi'

1378
01:41:40,094 --> 01:41:43,200
It is thanks to their true love

1379
01:41:43,363 --> 01:41:46,776
that the Upper Village
Has also turned green

1380
01:41:46,967 --> 01:41:52,076
Now there is equality
between Upper and Lower Village

1381
01:41:52,506 --> 01:41:57,580
This is the miracle of Goddess Bihai

1382
01:41:57,644 --> 01:42:01,524
Come on, let's go home

1383
01:42:18,432 --> 01:42:20,241
Don't worry, Kharu!

1384
01:42:20,934 --> 01:42:23,608
Even if he becomes an MLA,
he will still Report

1385
01:42:23,704 --> 01:42:27,208
to your daughter,
his home minister, right?

1386
01:42:27,307 --> 01:42:34,555
The question isn't who rules; sometimes it's
the King and sometimes is the commoner

1387
01:42:35,315 --> 01:42:40,856
The real question is,
how deep in water mare you?

1388
01:43:25,165 --> 01:43:28,738
You made us wait a
long time your Highness

1389
01:43:29,069 --> 01:43:30,309
But I agree,

1390
01:43:30,604 --> 01:43:35,917
no matter how much politics a politician
may do, Its not the same as a King

1391
01:43:36,143 --> 01:43:37,884
Doesn't matter what a King does,

1392
01:43:38,078 --> 01:43:40,888
if there is no political support,
nothing can happen

1393
01:43:40,981 --> 01:43:42,551
You're right!

1394
01:43:43,517 --> 01:43:48,364
You see, this is just our devotion
to the same thought.

1395
01:43:48,522 --> 01:43:52,163
His Highness said
the village needed water,

1396
01:43:52,492 --> 01:43:57,305
and we said we needed the votes
from both castes. so find a solution

1397
01:43:57,531 --> 01:43:59,807
We didn't even need
to find a solution,

1398
01:44:00,067 --> 01:44:03,276
all because of Goddess Bihai,
Long live Goddess Bihai!

1399
01:44:03,337 --> 01:44:05,180
Long live Goddess Bihai!

1400
01:44:06,206 --> 01:44:10,450
You do good, then good things happen,
and everything ends well.

1401
01:44:10,944 --> 01:44:14,357
Now I will sell the estate and
land and move to Bhubaneswar,

1402
01:44:14,648 --> 01:44:16,650
and my prince will leave for London

1403
01:44:16,717 --> 01:44:19,357
Daddy, the London and
Bhubaneswar plan is cancelled.

1404
01:44:20,621 --> 01:44:21,827
Why?

1405
01:44:22,289 --> 01:44:24,496
We're not selling
this land and estate.

1406
01:44:24,825 --> 01:44:25,826
But why?

1407
01:44:25,892 --> 01:44:29,032
We've worked so hard on this,
how can we just leave?

1408
01:44:29,429 --> 01:44:31,102
Are you mad?

1409
01:44:31,164 --> 01:44:35,806
Your highness, the father isn't always
the villain in all love stories

1410
01:44:42,542 --> 01:44:43,179
hmmm

1411
01:44:43,243 --> 01:44:47,123
Long live Goddess Bhai!
