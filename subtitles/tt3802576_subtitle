1
00:00:30,765 --> 00:00:32,733
Where is it?

2
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:35,370
Why is it in Paju?

3
00:00:35,037 --> 00:00:37,338
It took so long to get here.

4
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:39,540
Hello!

5
00:00:39,054 --> 00:00:39,822
What the...

6
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:42,476
What is this?

7
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:44,911
How come no one's here? It's the first day.

8
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:46,280
How come there are no desks?

9
00:00:46,028 --> 00:00:48,131
We're supposed to work like this here?

10
00:00:49,065 --> 00:00:50,266
This is my workplace.

11
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:53,153
Do people work like this these days?

12
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:55,023
What's up with this bed?

13
00:00:55,023 --> 00:00:56,456
They want us to sleep here?

14
00:01:00,528 --> 00:01:03,545
He knows about beauty better than women.

15
00:01:03,698 --> 00:01:06,566
Beauty Bible's only guy, Kwanghee.

16
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:09,203
- Kwanghee. / - Hyoni!

17
00:01:09,203 --> 00:01:10,238
Hi.

18
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,406
Hyoni.

19
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,493
You're an international model.

20
00:01:15,276 --> 00:01:16,610
Kwanghee.

21
00:01:16,061 --> 00:01:17,797
You have big shoulder pads.

22
00:01:18,346 --> 00:01:19,680
Oh, today...

23
00:01:19,068 --> 00:01:20,536
Wow.

24
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:22,883
Wow.

25
00:01:23,585 --> 00:01:25,020
Did you put something on your hips?

26
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:25,768
No way.

27
00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:27,321
I can't believe you're so curvy.

28
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:29,556
I'm a model, Kwanghee.

29
00:01:30,225 --> 00:01:32,426
She knows all about the trends.

30
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:35,473
But she's more of a theorist.

31
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:39,933
What's with the luggage?

32
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,468
What's with this place?

33
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:42,436
Hyoseong.

34
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:44,271
Are you a country girl?

35
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,773
You all came empty-handed?

36
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:47,508
We're having it delivered.

37
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:50,045
- Why bring it yourself? / - Really?

38
00:01:50,545 --> 00:01:53,080
She has to do everything herself.

39
00:01:53,008 --> 00:01:55,311
Hyoseong's full of passion.

40
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:57,451
What did you bring?

41
00:01:58,285 --> 00:01:59,620
What is that?

42
00:01:59,062 --> 00:02:00,363
Who says you're a top editor?

43
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:02,323
I thought I'd have a desk.

44
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:04,491
Honestly, your first impression is very important.

45
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:06,538
True, imagine a frumpy editor.

46
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:08,996
So this is the best you can do?

47
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:11,700
I'm wearing the best brands.

48
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:11,016
The best!

49
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:13,507
The best brands!

50
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:15,203
I shaved my hair!

51
00:02:15,203 --> 00:02:16,436
Totally clean!

52
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:18,105
I shaved my hair!

53
00:02:18,094 --> 00:02:20,897
Only where it's visible.

54
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:24,378
Only where it's visible.

55
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:26,346
You really are a top editor.

56
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,351
I brought a whole bunch of stuff too.

57
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:32,486
What's inside that?

58
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,621
My makeup pouch and other stuff.

59
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:37,658
I usually carry around 3 pouches.

60
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,960
This is the limited edition of my solo album.

61
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:42,830
This...

62
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:47,435
Hyoseong is amazing.

63
00:02:47,435 --> 00:02:49,570
He said you're amazing just now.

64
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:52,073
Hyoseong is really amazing.

65
00:02:52,073 --> 00:02:53,140
- What's this? / - Oh, this.

66
00:02:53,014 --> 00:02:55,550
Our schedule is important.

67
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:58,178
- Secret calendar. / - Wow.

68
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,281
Stop advertising your group!

69
00:03:00,748 --> 00:03:01,716
Geez.

70
00:03:01,716 --> 00:03:04,783
It's good to check your schedule with it.

71
00:03:05,386 --> 00:03:06,788
You didn't bring anything?

72
00:03:06,788 --> 00:03:07,791
Me?

73
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:09,123
Myself.

74
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:10,525
I brought myself.

75
00:03:10,525 --> 00:03:11,258
You must know a lot of stuff.

76
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:13,661
- You meet international beauties. / - Yes.

77
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:14,663
You're always ahead when it comes to fashion.

78
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,530
And you recently modeled for all the collections.

79
00:03:16,053 --> 00:03:19,658
I'm so curious about what you two have prepared.

80
00:03:20,135 --> 00:03:22,403
We've prepared something to survive.

81
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:23,971
- We'll see. / - We can't just die.

82
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:24,938
Let's see what you've prepared.

83
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:27,541
What we've prepared is very hot.

84
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,876
The three unique editors will show us

85
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,013
the real beauty world.

86
00:03:32,013 --> 00:03:35,150
What can you expect from Hyoseong?

87
00:03:36,885 --> 00:03:39,386
You'll become prettier with Beauty Bible.

88
00:03:40,388 --> 00:03:42,490
Aren't you just applying a bunch of makeup?

89
00:03:43,358 --> 00:03:44,891
What if Barbara Palvin comes here?

90
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,360
Saying, "Hello, guys!"

91
00:03:46,036 --> 00:03:46,771
What is it?

92
00:03:47,095 --> 00:03:48,396
It's from abroad.

93
00:03:48,396 --> 00:03:48,405
It's here!

94
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:51,363
We got a letter.

95
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,035
You can follow the hottest beauty trends

96
00:03:54,035 --> 00:03:56,771
with just this one episode.

97
00:03:57,671 --> 00:03:59,440
It doesn't feel good for me at all.

98
00:03:59,044 --> 00:04:01,280
Then how do you maintain your figure?

99
00:04:03,511 --> 00:04:05,346
The first issue of Beauty Bible.

100
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:07,748
"Cramming For The 2015 Trends."

101
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:09,783
We have to start making

102
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:12,820
the first issue right now.

103
00:04:12,082 --> 00:04:14,785
We have to fill in the blanks.

104
00:04:15,523 --> 00:04:17,620
So that the people can know

105
00:04:18,493 --> 00:04:21,628
the beauty trends at a glance.

106
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:24,131
- I've prepared something. / - What?

107
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:25,966
The fashion collection just ended.

108
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:30,505
I've analyzed the recent makeup trends.

109
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:32,306
Hello.

110
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:36,745
I'm at the Seoul Fashion Week venue.

111
00:04:36,745 --> 00:04:40,248
As you see, there are tons of people.

112
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:42,550
Since I'm not wearing makeup,

113
00:04:42,055 --> 00:04:44,290
I'll hurry up and go in.

114
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:50,625
They're all saying you're pretty.

115
00:04:52,006 --> 00:04:54,074
The people in the fashion industry

116
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:55,296
must really love top models.

117
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:57,398
Models are more popular than celebrities

118
00:04:57,398 --> 00:04:58,331
around this time.

119
00:04:58,331 --> 00:04:59,600
- Of course. / - Right.

120
00:04:59,006 --> 00:05:01,142
Celebrities don't look as good there.

121
00:05:01,736 --> 00:05:04,438
- You know what I mean? / - Right. That's true.

122
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:07,775
In March, Fashion Week was held in Seoul.

123
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:12,280
It's the best place to learn the 2015 beauty trends.

124
00:05:12,028 --> 00:05:15,125
All the hot experts and models are here.

125
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:18,060
You can meet all of them at

126
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:20,322
the backstage of the fashion show.

127
00:05:20,655 --> 00:05:22,752
The trend of 2015 is the natural look.

128
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:26,060
What are the models' skin care tips?

129
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,228
I need to shoot this quickly.

130
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:29,430
It's Wonjoong.

131
00:05:29,043 --> 00:05:30,378
- Wonjoong. / - Hyoni.

132
00:05:30,765 --> 00:05:32,033
- Hi. / - Hi.

133
00:05:32,033 --> 00:05:34,435
Isn't that Kim Wonjoong?

134
00:05:35,603 --> 00:05:37,705
Fashion advertisements are important

135
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:40,208
but I think the beauty market is bigger.

136
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:44,011
So I want you to win against other beauty show hosts,

137
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:46,546
make tons of money

138
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:48,015
with all different kinds of brands.

139
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,751
- Go, Hyoni. / - He's so practical.

140
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:51,753
Hi, Stephanie.

141
00:05:51,753 --> 00:05:52,886
Hello.

142
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:54,755
I have a question.

143
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:56,802
Tell me your secret beauty tip.

144
00:05:57,225 --> 00:05:59,160
- Beauty tip? / - Yes, your own special tip.

145
00:05:59,016 --> 00:06:00,651
Not something that everyone does.

146
00:06:00,795 --> 00:06:04,931
Put cold cotton all over your face.

147
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:07,668
If you soothe your face,

148
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:10,735
it becomes moist and less swollen.

149
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:14,075
- In the morning? / - Yes, morning beauty tip.

150
00:06:14,075 --> 00:06:16,043
A real beauty tip.

151
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:17,611
Drink a lot of water.

152
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:19,180
That's too obvious. No.

153
00:06:19,018 --> 00:06:19,684
That's not good.

154
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,281
I only use these fingers

155
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:24,518
when I wash my face.

156
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,453
Your ring fingers are the weakest.

157
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,143
I don't want to irritate my skin.

158
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:34,061
It'll take a million years to wash up.

159
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,930
So it's a very meticulous wash.

160
00:06:35,093 --> 00:06:37,896
That's passionate cleansing.

161
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:41,780
I have dry skin.

162
00:06:42,203 --> 00:06:45,806
So I use moisturizers quite often.

163
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:47,775
Come here, Hyunyi.

164
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:49,076
Is it over?

165
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:50,645
- I'm about to do it. / - You're going to?

166
00:06:50,645 --> 00:06:52,180
Then before you go,

167
00:06:52,018 --> 00:06:56,254
tell me your skin care secret.

168
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,423
You need to pay me.

169
00:06:59,072 --> 00:07:00,773
She knows money.

170
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,325
Of course, I know about TV shows.

171
00:07:06,006 --> 00:07:08,107
Tell me your secret tip before you go.

172
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:09,730
Or you can't go on the show.

173
00:07:09,073 --> 00:07:11,809
The best way to moisturize is

174
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:16,805
to repeat application of serum

175
00:07:16,805 --> 00:07:18,606
with the smallest particles.

176
00:07:18,606 --> 00:07:20,308
That's a great tip.

177
00:07:20,308 --> 00:07:21,308
That was a good one.

178
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:22,910
I'll send an invoice.

179
00:07:22,091 --> 00:07:24,026
You'd better go now. Bye.

180
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:26,613
Not yet.

181
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:27,948
Go now.

182
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,516
I don't need to go yet.

183
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:32,520
This interviewer is so arrogant. She's sitting down.

184
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:33,687
That was a fun interview.

185
00:07:34,155 --> 00:07:35,423
Thank you.

186
00:07:36,925 --> 00:07:40,028
The best way to moisturize is

187
00:07:40,028 --> 00:07:42,596
to repeat application of serum.

188
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:46,835
Put cold cotton all over your face.

189
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:50,671
I don't want to irritate my skin.

190
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:52,973
I only use these fingers.

191
00:07:53,775 --> 00:07:55,176
How were my interviews?

192
00:07:55,176 --> 00:07:58,613
Models always work overseas.

193
00:07:58,613 --> 00:08:01,660
Fashion and beauty are everyday life for them.

194
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,385
I thought there would be something special.

195
00:08:04,385 --> 00:08:06,353
But they spoke about removing makeup,

196
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:08,390
applying basic products and basic stuff...

197
00:08:08,723 --> 00:08:10,591
So you're saying it wasn't good?

198
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:12,260
No, I was shocked.

199
00:08:12,026 --> 00:08:13,427
I expected something spectacular.

200
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:15,763
And there was nothing spectacular?

201
00:08:15,763 --> 00:08:17,831
No, it was focused on the basics.

202
00:08:18,633 --> 00:08:21,268
First, we need to decide the title.

203
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:23,315
- Something that grabs attention. / - Right.

204
00:08:23,738 --> 00:08:24,738
A catchphrase.

205
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:25,640
I'm curious.

206
00:08:25,064 --> 00:08:27,632
I bet articles about Hyoseong

207
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,011
have amazing titles.

208
00:08:30,011 --> 00:08:31,278
Like "Bursting..."

209
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:35,016
Like "Busting out of her clothes."

210
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:36,183
That's what they say.

211
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:37,985
The reporters are always...

212
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:40,788
What about "What happened backstage?"

213
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:42,090
That's right!

214
00:08:42,009 --> 00:08:44,777
Since you take off your clothes backstage.

215
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:45,426
Right.

216
00:08:45,426 --> 00:08:48,463
Actually, cleansing is removing makeup.

217
00:08:50,865 --> 00:08:53,200
"What did Hyoni remove backstage?"

218
00:08:55,803 --> 00:08:57,538
That's even worse.

219
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:59,840
That sounds good. I actually like that.

220
00:08:59,084 --> 00:08:59,985
That's it.

221
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:03,478
- We shouldn't help her. / - Really?

222
00:09:03,478 --> 00:09:05,713
- Prepare your own segment. / - Okay.

223
00:09:05,713 --> 00:09:07,181
I'm curious. What's your content?

224
00:09:07,181 --> 00:09:09,650
Since we're idol stars,

225
00:09:09,065 --> 00:09:11,968
we asked idol singers about their beauty secrets.

226
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:14,955
- I'm curious. / - Let's watch the video clip.

227
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:17,258
- He's hosting again. / - Like a host.

228
00:09:17,258 --> 00:09:19,335
- I'm used to it. / - You've been a host forever.

229
00:09:20,495 --> 00:09:22,963
Hi, I'm Kwanghee.

230
00:09:23,765 --> 00:09:26,466
I'm at a broadcasting station now.

231
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:30,071
The prettiest beauty is here with us.

232
00:09:30,071 --> 00:09:33,608
I'm here to tell you some beauty tips.

233
00:09:33,608 --> 00:09:35,810
Follow me and let's find out who it is.

234
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:38,245
She's in a girl group that

235
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,342
always leads the beauty trends.

236
00:09:41,215 --> 00:09:43,316
Who is today's star?

237
00:09:44,085 --> 00:09:46,053
She's quite sensitive.

238
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:47,455
She's hot too.

239
00:09:48,856 --> 00:09:50,158
She must be super hot.

240
00:09:50,158 --> 00:09:51,091
She's hot.

241
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,660
I wonder who it is.

242
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:56,063
Gain.

243
00:09:56,063 --> 00:09:59,266
She's known for her sexy charm

244
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,803
and unique idol star makeup.

245
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:06,453
All girls want to be like Gain.

246
00:10:07,408 --> 00:10:09,743
Even among celebrities,

247
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:11,880
she's known for her hair and makeup

248
00:10:11,088 --> 00:10:12,723
and many celebrities copy her.

249
00:10:13,515 --> 00:10:14,948
She started the smokey eye makeup

250
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,035
and the smudging lip makeup as well.

251
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:19,453
Many idol stars imitate the look.

252
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:21,490
A lot of people called themselves Gain

253
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,827
when they wore smokey eye makeup.

254
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:27,095
Everyone wants to copy her eye makeup.

255
00:10:27,095 --> 00:10:29,063
Tell me about your current eye makeup.

256
00:10:29,063 --> 00:10:30,798
Actually, I removed my makeup

257
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:32,566
since I'm not performing now.

258
00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:35,603
But I wear a lot of loose pearls.

259
00:10:35,603 --> 00:10:40,308
So that my eyes look very sparkly.

260
00:10:40,308 --> 00:10:42,576
Many people copy that look,

261
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:43,945
but they're not as pretty as you.

262
00:10:43,945 --> 00:10:46,180
You need compliment them for interviews.

263
00:10:46,018 --> 00:10:48,085
Is there a certain angle you go for?

264
00:10:48,085 --> 00:10:50,620
In my case, I don't do the cat eye makeup.

265
00:10:51,385 --> 00:10:52,953
I actually go downward.

266
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:55,690
Oh, her ends go down, not up.

267
00:10:55,069 --> 00:10:56,904
We usually think the smokey eye makeup

268
00:10:57,525 --> 00:11:00,028
should go upward for an intense impression.

269
00:11:00,028 --> 00:11:01,996
But since it's intense enough,

270
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:03,798
the downward angle softens it.

271
00:11:03,798 --> 00:11:06,000
Gain said the current trend is to

272
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,503
draw it downward and make it longer.

273
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:13,808
Is that why you drew yours downward too?

274
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:17,345
We go to the same makeup salon.

275
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:19,613
Kwanghee's wearing makeup too.

276
00:11:19,613 --> 00:11:21,315
Guys wear more makeup these days.

277
00:11:21,315 --> 00:11:22,883
You know who goes too?

278
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:25,020
Lee Jungjae, Jung Woosung, Jang Donggun,

279
00:11:25,002 --> 00:11:27,103
G-Dragon, T.O.P, myself and Siwan.

280
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:28,623
We all go to the same salon.

281
00:11:28,623 --> 00:11:29,556
What a hot place!

282
00:11:31,926 --> 00:11:33,761
Cramming the trend, number two.

283
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:36,196
Drawing sexy eyelines.

284
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:38,933
I'm here now.

285
00:11:38,933 --> 00:11:41,635
I'm the only one here but we have a big camera.

286
00:11:41,635 --> 00:11:43,838
The main director is there too?

287
00:11:43,838 --> 00:11:45,840
Since she's a female idol singer?

288
00:11:48,576 --> 00:11:50,845
Oh, I look great.

289
00:11:55,316 --> 00:11:57,318
Let's go meet the idol star

290
00:11:57,318 --> 00:12:00,345
for the first episode now.

291
00:12:00,588 --> 00:12:02,056
You're right behind me, right?

292
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:04,825
My left profile looks better.

293
00:12:06,895 --> 00:12:09,063
Should I go like this?

294
00:12:09,063 --> 00:12:11,498
What's with her?

295
00:12:11,498 --> 00:12:13,535
Idol stars are all like that.

296
00:12:13,535 --> 00:12:16,370
She keeps looking into the camera.

297
00:12:16,037 --> 00:12:18,473
It's like a music show.

298
00:12:19,373 --> 00:12:21,341
It's hilarious.

299
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:23,438
Her name is right here.

300
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:25,613
You'll be shocked.

301
00:12:25,613 --> 00:12:27,981
She'll be shining brightly...

302
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:36,323
She's so lively.

303
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:38,360
She's very active.

304
00:12:38,036 --> 00:12:41,071
Our first episode's topic is hot trends.

305
00:12:41,395 --> 00:12:44,531
The hottest trend of the day.

306
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:45,666
Your legs are so pretty.

307
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:48,903
Your skin is pale too. So pretty.

308
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:52,940
Girl groups have secrets about their legs?

309
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:57,545
The star to reveal the secret of slim legs is...

310
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:02,450
She has long Barbie doll legs.

311
00:13:02,045 --> 00:13:05,102
All the girls are jealous of Minah's body.

312
00:13:06,062 --> 00:13:08,365
The hottest trend of the day.

313
00:13:09,323 --> 00:13:12,026
I felt you'd be perfect.

314
00:13:12,026 --> 00:13:13,628
- Really? / - So I came to film you.

315
00:13:13,628 --> 00:13:15,363
Your legs are just flawless.

316
00:13:15,363 --> 00:13:17,098
Oh, please.

317
00:13:17,098 --> 00:13:18,331
Aren't they beautiful?

318
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:20,000
I thought they used computer graphics.

319
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,803
Your skin is pale too. Can I touch you?

320
00:13:21,803 --> 00:13:23,705
Of course.

321
00:13:23,705 --> 00:13:25,373
Your legs are so pretty.

322
00:13:25,373 --> 00:13:27,470
I bet you have a special method

323
00:13:28,343 --> 00:13:31,345
to keep your body slim and fit.

324
00:13:31,345 --> 00:13:37,951
Actually, my calves often become swollen.

325
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:39,386
Yeah? I can't tell.

326
00:13:39,386 --> 00:13:41,321
If I work for a long time,

327
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,823
I find my legs swollen.

328
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:45,860
You have your main bone here.

329
00:13:45,086 --> 00:13:49,093
- Oh, here? / - You want to press it down.

330
00:13:49,093 --> 00:13:50,896
Oh, the front side?

331
00:13:51,733 --> 00:13:54,768
Yes. If you press them before bed,

332
00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:56,236
your legs will be fine in the morning.

333
00:13:56,236 --> 00:14:00,741
You know how girl groups wear body makeup

334
00:14:00,741 --> 00:14:02,710
to make our bodies stand out.

335
00:14:02,071 --> 00:14:03,839
Tell me some secrets on that too.

336
00:14:04,478 --> 00:14:07,215
- I actually just clump makeup on. / - Really?

337
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:14,155
I tend to put on a lot of oil to look healthy.

338
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:20,152
Let us know of any workouts you do

339
00:14:20,395 --> 00:14:21,863
for your body.

340
00:14:21,863 --> 00:14:24,698
I tend to work out before going to bed.

341
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:25,433
- Before going to bed? / - Yes.

342
00:14:25,433 --> 00:14:27,101
I do some stretching before bed

343
00:14:27,101 --> 00:14:28,770
and when I wash my face,

344
00:14:28,077 --> 00:14:30,878
I shake my hips.

345
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:33,598
Doesn't water splash everywhere

346
00:14:33,841 --> 00:14:33,850
when you go like this?

347
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:36,778
It doesn't matter if it splashes everywhere

348
00:14:37,111 --> 00:14:39,180
since I'm alone.

349
00:14:39,018 --> 00:14:40,853
When Minah was talking about her legs,

350
00:14:41,015 --> 00:14:43,283
Hyoseong mentioned something she does too.

351
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:44,685
I'm curious about that too.

352
00:14:44,685 --> 00:14:47,321
Contrast is key for people like us.

353
00:14:47,821 --> 00:14:50,858
I call it "2-2 makeup."

354
00:14:50,858 --> 00:14:51,960
2-2?

355
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:56,396
2cm longer and 2cm thinner.

356
00:14:57,398 --> 00:14:59,485
She's good with coming up with names.

357
00:15:00,268 --> 00:15:02,936
Did you major in language?

358
00:15:05,006 --> 00:15:07,908
It's important to make them shiny.

359
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:09,945
So go down the center.

360
00:15:10,278 --> 00:15:11,713
Near the bones.

361
00:15:11,713 --> 00:15:14,648
You can look fat if you go outwards.

362
00:15:14,648 --> 00:15:16,725
When you're doing that, you look so...

363
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:26,942
I feel like I'm a pervert.

364
00:15:27,095 --> 00:15:30,131
Hyoseong looks sexy doing anything.

365
00:15:30,131 --> 00:15:30,865
When she does this...

366
00:15:30,865 --> 00:15:34,501
There are powder and cream types

367
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:36,103
of shading products these days.

368
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:38,806
Creams are popular now. The color...

369
00:15:38,806 --> 00:15:40,541
- What color is that? / - It's weird.

370
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,076
- Why is it so dark? / - It's bronze.

371
00:15:42,076 --> 00:15:44,878
It spreads after you rub it on.

372
00:15:44,878 --> 00:15:46,480
I think you'd look bruised

373
00:15:46,048 --> 00:15:47,549
if you don't rub it well.

374
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:50,048
- It's important to rub it well. / - Awesome.

375
00:15:51,185 --> 00:15:53,888
- Now they look thinner. / - It looks slim.

376
00:15:53,888 --> 00:15:56,905
It looks healthy, but thinner.

377
00:15:58,158 --> 00:16:00,695
So idol stars make their legs prettier like this.

378
00:16:00,695 --> 00:16:02,530
If you're really desperate...

379
00:16:02,053 --> 00:16:04,110
I heard there are simple workouts

380
00:16:05,001 --> 00:16:07,802
to get nice, sexy thighs.

381
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:12,906
It looks really simple, but it's tough.

382
00:16:12,906 --> 00:16:14,953
You put a book between your legs

383
00:16:15,376 --> 00:16:16,911
and you keep it there for a while.

384
00:16:16,911 --> 00:16:18,346
That can't be hard.

385
00:16:18,346 --> 00:16:19,680
- Really. / - I want to try.

386
00:16:19,068 --> 00:16:20,869
You need to tighten your hips

387
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,883
and strengthen your abs too.

388
00:16:22,883 --> 00:16:23,851
Let me try.

389
00:16:23,851 --> 00:16:25,753
- It's tough. / - My legs are thin like girls' legs.

390
00:16:25,753 --> 00:16:26,988
He's doing it now.

391
00:16:26,988 --> 00:16:27,855
It's easy, but...

392
00:16:28,456 --> 00:16:29,390
It's easy, but...

393
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:31,358
Excuse me.

394
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:33,026
- It's so tough. / - Please work out.

395
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:34,995
It's a thick book, but it's really tough.

396
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:37,042
Hang in there.

397
00:16:37,465 --> 00:16:39,666
I feel this part tightening.

398
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,903
Your inner thighs and hips too.

399
00:16:41,903 --> 00:16:43,905
- Your hips tighten? / - They do.

400
00:16:43,905 --> 00:16:46,140
- I'm using my inner muscles. / - Right.

401
00:16:46,014 --> 00:16:47,149
The legs feel like they're getting thinner.

402
00:16:47,275 --> 00:16:50,211
You can also do abdomen workouts.

403
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:52,380
It's really hard.

404
00:16:52,038 --> 00:16:54,874
You can totally tell he never works out.

405
00:16:55,216 --> 00:16:57,818
I see your effort pays off.

406
00:16:58,453 --> 00:17:00,221
Cramming the trend, three.

407
00:17:00,221 --> 00:17:02,723
Making sexy legs.

408
00:17:04,158 --> 00:17:05,593
Go down the center.

409
00:17:05,593 --> 00:17:08,730
You can look fat if you go outwards.

410
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:11,231
You place a book between your legs

411
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:13,133
and you keep it there for a while.

412
00:17:15,736 --> 00:17:17,471
I'll learn this makeup

413
00:17:17,471 --> 00:17:19,240
and use it for clubbing.

414
00:17:19,024 --> 00:17:20,525
The hair got on sideways.

415
00:17:21,308 --> 00:17:22,810
Whose hair is it?

416
00:17:22,081 --> 00:17:23,282
I'm not sure if it's just me,

417
00:17:24,011 --> 00:17:25,113
but she looks like Son Yejin.

418
00:17:25,113 --> 00:17:28,416
Aren't you just applying a bunch of makeup?

419
00:17:30,885 --> 00:17:33,286
I think we've wrapped up the first task.

420
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:34,788
Now it's the beauty class.

421
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:36,190
I think this segment is the most important.

422
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:38,120
I bet the ladies like beauty class the most.

423
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,228
The hottest trend...

424
00:17:40,228 --> 00:17:41,796
Oh!

425
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:48,370
I'm so shocked.

426
00:17:48,037 --> 00:17:50,172
How can you just barge in?

427
00:17:50,505 --> 00:17:53,073
- You just came out of the blue. / - Hello.

428
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:54,141
She came in all of a sudden.

429
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:57,378
Hello, I'm Kim Hyojeong. I'm a makeup artist.

430
00:18:04,085 --> 00:18:05,886
You're the supporting model, right?

431
00:18:05,886 --> 00:18:06,788
I'm Wang Yujin.

432
00:18:06,788 --> 00:18:07,790
Nice to have you on the show.

433
00:18:07,988 --> 00:18:10,291
But we need more space for the class and show.

434
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:11,258
Of course.

435
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:12,526
We can make space here.

436
00:18:12,526 --> 00:18:14,861
I'll do it since I'm a guy.

437
00:18:17,565 --> 00:18:19,500
- Kwanghee is so strong. / - Are you okay?

438
00:18:19,005 --> 00:18:21,062
Gosh, this chair must be over 100kg.

439
00:18:22,007 --> 00:18:22,873
Don't overdo it.

440
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:25,840
- We can put it here. / - Thank you.

441
00:18:25,084 --> 00:18:26,652
Just trust me.

442
00:18:28,091 --> 00:18:29,826
We're ready for makeup.

443
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:32,513
- I'm satisfied. / - It's a lot.

444
00:18:32,513 --> 00:18:33,881
- Is it okay? / - Yes.

445
00:18:33,881 --> 00:18:35,316
It's perfect.

446
00:18:35,316 --> 00:18:37,785
We'll have a beauty class

447
00:18:37,785 --> 00:18:40,188
with the expert now.

448
00:18:40,188 --> 00:18:41,790
Why are you acting awkward?

449
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,714
We need to do the beauty class.

450
00:18:43,425 --> 00:18:46,193
It has to go on the magazine.

451
00:18:46,193 --> 00:18:48,261
It's important. This makeup class...

452
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:50,998
Since we're not professionals.

453
00:18:50,998 --> 00:18:53,835
I'll tell you makeup tips

454
00:18:53,835 --> 00:18:55,503
using the hot color of 2015.

455
00:18:55,503 --> 00:18:56,504
- Hot color? / - Yes.

456
00:18:56,603 --> 00:18:57,690
I know...

457
00:18:58,473 --> 00:18:59,806
- What color? / - I know what color it is.

458
00:19:04,778 --> 00:19:07,281
It's part of her outfit.

459
00:19:11,285 --> 00:19:13,312
Oh, I know.

460
00:19:13,555 --> 00:19:16,622
The gold brooch on her chest. Gosh.

461
00:19:17,225 --> 00:19:20,961
So I'm wearing gold too!

462
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:23,365
- You're wrong. / - Wrong?

463
00:19:23,365 --> 00:19:24,368
It's not gold?

464
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:26,672
You want to guess, Hyoseong?

465
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:28,803
Marsala.

466
00:19:28,803 --> 00:19:30,038
That's correct.

467
00:19:47,188 --> 00:19:49,323
I looked into how it would look

468
00:19:49,323 --> 00:19:52,360
on the face as makeup.

469
00:19:53,561 --> 00:19:55,430
- It's bold. / - This feel...

470
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:57,150
- But it's really chic. / - It's pretty.

471
00:19:58,005 --> 00:19:59,940
You can look innocent and pure.

472
00:20:00,835 --> 00:20:02,103
It's sexy.

473
00:20:02,103 --> 00:20:03,405
It can look sexy.

474
00:20:03,405 --> 00:20:06,340
I want to learn this makeup...

475
00:20:07,408 --> 00:20:09,543
And use it for clubbing.

476
00:20:11,178 --> 00:20:12,380
Why's he laughing like that?

477
00:20:12,038 --> 00:20:13,439
I think there's something

478
00:20:13,781 --> 00:20:16,050
that will come in handy for Hyoni.

479
00:20:16,005 --> 00:20:17,340
You'll show us a few tips?

480
00:20:17,385 --> 00:20:19,686
I'll show you 3 looks today.

481
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:22,723
It's delayed attack Marsala makeup.

482
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:23,591
Delayed attack.

483
00:20:23,591 --> 00:20:25,226
You apply makeup for different times?

484
00:20:25,226 --> 00:20:25,234
For different times.

485
00:20:26,026 --> 00:20:26,032
There's one color and

486
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:28,261
you can apply makeup for different times?

487
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:29,596
We'll have a certain focal point.

488
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:31,665
Depending on the eye makeup,

489
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:34,668
the overall flow or feel can

490
00:20:34,668 --> 00:20:35,503
seem very different.

491
00:20:35,503 --> 00:20:37,505
Since it's spring, I'll use Marsala.

492
00:20:37,505 --> 00:20:39,140
This will be a noon version

493
00:20:39,014 --> 00:20:40,915
for a brunch date.

494
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:43,578
You'll use Marsala...

495
00:20:43,578 --> 00:20:45,613
It could look weird.

496
00:20:45,613 --> 00:20:47,048
You might look like you didn't remove

497
00:20:47,048 --> 00:20:48,281
your makeup from last night.

498
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:51,986
It might look like you were beat up from afar.

499
00:20:51,986 --> 00:20:52,620
I'm worried.

500
00:20:52,062 --> 00:20:53,397
- That's not good. / - That's bad.

501
00:20:53,955 --> 00:20:56,090
Let's not be suspicious.

502
00:20:56,009 --> 00:20:57,310
I'll leave if you can't trust me.

503
00:20:57,391 --> 00:20:58,225
Please...

504
00:20:58,225 --> 00:20:59,060
No.

505
00:20:59,893 --> 00:21:02,296
In order to give an accent with Marsala,

506
00:21:02,296 --> 00:21:04,965
I'll make the skin look like

507
00:21:04,965 --> 00:21:06,266
there's hardly any makeup on.

508
00:21:07,101 --> 00:21:08,703
First, I'll wipe her face

509
00:21:08,703 --> 00:21:10,800
with toner on a cotton pad.

510
00:21:11,673 --> 00:21:13,140
The dead skin will

511
00:21:13,014 --> 00:21:14,101
come off on the cotton pad.

512
00:21:15,001 --> 00:21:16,869
I don't use towels.

513
00:21:16,878 --> 00:21:20,581
After I wash my face, when it's still wet,

514
00:21:20,581 --> 00:21:21,916
I lightly wipe it with cotton and

515
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:24,551
wipe it off with toner.

516
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:25,820
Is that better?

517
00:21:25,082 --> 00:21:29,887
So I never let my face get dry.

518
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:33,712
So all my cosmetics are in my bathroom.

519
00:21:34,495 --> 00:21:35,796
So you can use them right away after you shower?

520
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:37,831
We'll start the base makeup now.

521
00:21:37,831 --> 00:21:39,466
As you see, I'll mix

522
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:42,503
makeup base and foundation.

523
00:21:42,503 --> 00:21:44,638
The skin will become more moist

524
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:45,940
and the complexion will improve

525
00:21:45,094 --> 00:21:46,729
when you add the makeup base.

526
00:21:47,575 --> 00:21:49,010
But with noon makeup,

527
00:21:49,001 --> 00:21:51,036
the skin is essential.

528
00:21:51,045 --> 00:21:53,748
I tried to make it look natural.

529
00:21:53,748 --> 00:21:54,915
It's like she's not wearing makeup.

530
00:21:54,915 --> 00:21:57,918
She really is covered up now.

531
00:21:57,918 --> 00:22:00,455
Her skin was red before.

532
00:22:00,455 --> 00:22:01,790
She had no makeup on earlier.

533
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:02,780
Now her face looks so clean.

534
00:22:03,491 --> 00:22:06,460
She looks like Son Yejin.

535
00:22:06,046 --> 00:22:07,481
She looks like Son Yejin after the makeup.

536
00:22:07,895 --> 00:22:08,830
Yeah.

537
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:11,219
The skin is really important.

538
00:22:11,966 --> 00:22:13,868
I'm going to draw the eyebrows now.

539
00:22:13,868 --> 00:22:16,536
Use an eye shadow similar to the color

540
00:22:16,536 --> 00:22:20,241
of your brows and brush it on roughly.

541
00:22:20,241 --> 00:22:21,776
Just fill in the inner eyeline

542
00:22:21,776 --> 00:22:23,911
to make it look natural.

543
00:22:23,911 --> 00:22:28,248
That brush is used like a seal

544
00:22:28,248 --> 00:22:30,385
for people who have trouble applying eyeliner.

545
00:22:30,385 --> 00:22:33,721
- That gives a big change. / - Clear line.

546
00:22:33,721 --> 00:22:35,456
The eyeline is important but

547
00:22:35,456 --> 00:22:39,060
eyelashes are also important for pretty eyes.

548
00:22:39,006 --> 00:22:40,607
I don't think she'll do them.

549
00:22:40,661 --> 00:22:42,748
I'll show you how to make them look long

550
00:22:43,531 --> 00:22:45,100
with just mascara and an eyelash curler.

551
00:22:45,001 --> 00:22:46,367
- Without extensions? / - No.

552
00:22:46,466 --> 00:22:49,270
Tell me. My mom drives me nuts.

553
00:22:49,027 --> 00:22:52,130
I'm going insane because of this.

554
00:22:52,373 --> 00:22:54,341
She wants me to get coupons.

555
00:22:54,808 --> 00:22:57,211
Clamp the lashes at the base.

556
00:22:57,211 --> 00:22:58,713
Base?

557
00:22:58,713 --> 00:23:02,350
And you go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

558
00:23:02,035 --> 00:23:03,670
They went right up.

559
00:23:03,985 --> 00:23:05,886
You can use regular mascara?

560
00:23:05,886 --> 00:23:07,588
This is transparent.

561
00:23:07,588 --> 00:23:09,223
I'll show you.

562
00:23:09,223 --> 00:23:11,091
No color...

563
00:23:11,091 --> 00:23:12,626
Come here.

564
00:23:12,626 --> 00:23:14,961
Transparent mascara.

565
00:23:16,263 --> 00:23:17,665
- They're getting longer. / - They are.

566
00:23:17,665 --> 00:23:18,900
They're thicker.

567
00:23:20,635 --> 00:23:23,652
Can you see the hair?

568
00:23:23,805 --> 00:23:25,806
Whose hair is it?

569
00:23:25,806 --> 00:23:27,308
- Oh, what is it? / - Do you see the hair?

570
00:23:27,308 --> 00:23:28,376
What is it?

571
00:23:28,376 --> 00:23:29,380
It's not my hair.

572
00:23:29,776 --> 00:23:32,680
There's hair inside the mascara?

573
00:23:32,068 --> 00:23:33,903
- The product is made like that? / - Yes.

574
00:23:35,616 --> 00:23:37,185
That's great.

575
00:23:37,185 --> 00:23:39,120
That transparent mascara is like...

576
00:23:39,012 --> 00:23:41,447
Is it real hair?

577
00:23:41,555 --> 00:23:42,290
Oh, my...

578
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:43,430
I've never seen anything like that.

579
00:23:43,691 --> 00:23:44,925
Me too.

580
00:23:44,925 --> 00:23:46,193
I want to try.

581
00:23:46,193 --> 00:23:47,795
It's great.

582
00:23:47,795 --> 00:23:50,431
But it looks gross.

583
00:23:51,365 --> 00:23:53,166
I've never seen you wear makeup.

584
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:54,668
It's awkward for me too.

585
00:23:54,668 --> 00:23:55,503
It's getting longer, right?

586
00:23:55,503 --> 00:23:57,738
No, excuse me...

587
00:23:57,738 --> 00:24:00,641
The hair got on sideways.

588
00:24:00,641 --> 00:24:02,843
Get it on the right way.

589
00:24:05,013 --> 00:24:06,881
Like this.

590
00:24:06,881 --> 00:24:07,948
Oh, it's longer now.

591
00:24:07,948 --> 00:24:08,750
What is it?

592
00:24:08,075 --> 00:24:08,941
It's so long now.

593
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:12,643
Only one eye is much bigger!

594
00:24:15,099 --> 00:24:16,034
Wait.

595
00:24:16,925 --> 00:24:19,993
You'll become so popular.

596
00:24:19,993 --> 00:24:21,361
When it goes on the magazine...

597
00:24:21,361 --> 00:24:23,030
Just forget about Marsala.

598
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,806
- Go with mascara? / - That's the idea.

599
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:29,070
You did the eyelashes first.

600
00:24:29,007 --> 00:24:31,275
If the eyes stand out too much,

601
00:24:31,338 --> 00:24:33,173
it might not look pretty.

602
00:24:33,173 --> 00:24:34,708
So you use the mascara

603
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:36,811
for a bit of structure first.

604
00:24:36,811 --> 00:24:37,845
Then you add the shadow.

605
00:24:37,845 --> 00:24:40,852
You'll see that less is more.

606
00:24:40,915 --> 00:24:44,418
I'll use Marsala color for eye makeup.

607
00:24:44,418 --> 00:24:46,386
I'll use this lipstick for eye shadow.

608
00:24:47,921 --> 00:24:49,490
Control the amount.

609
00:24:49,049 --> 00:24:51,485
Mix it with a bit of foundation

610
00:24:51,926 --> 00:24:53,361
with a lip brush.

611
00:24:53,361 --> 00:24:54,295
Lip brush...

612
00:24:54,295 --> 00:24:55,730
If you like heavy makeup,

613
00:24:55,073 --> 00:24:56,241
make it dark.

614
00:24:56,898 --> 00:24:57,901
If you want to look natural,

615
00:24:58,198 --> 00:24:59,533
add a bit more concealer.

616
00:24:59,533 --> 00:25:02,936
Apply it to the outer corner. Open your eyes.

617
00:25:02,936 --> 00:25:03,938
See?

618
00:25:03,938 --> 00:25:06,306
It's a subtle look.

619
00:25:06,306 --> 00:25:07,941
- Eyes look deep. / - There's subtlety.

620
00:25:08,876 --> 00:25:10,311
She looks pure and innocent.

621
00:25:11,045 --> 00:25:12,613
I'll give you another tip.

622
00:25:12,613 --> 00:25:15,350
You use this at home, right?

623
00:25:15,035 --> 00:25:16,636
You mix it with this.

624
00:25:16,951 --> 00:25:18,953
Oh, lotion and a shimmer shadow?

625
00:25:18,953 --> 00:25:20,088
Wouldn't it be sticky?

626
00:25:20,088 --> 00:25:22,223
The shadow is made of powder,

627
00:25:22,223 --> 00:25:23,458
so it evens it out.

628
00:25:23,458 --> 00:25:24,525
- Really? / - Yes.

629
00:25:27,428 --> 00:25:29,930
Will you apply Marsala on the lips too?

630
00:25:29,093 --> 00:25:30,394
Yes.

631
00:25:31,231 --> 00:25:33,166
There is a wide variety.

632
00:25:33,166 --> 00:25:34,968
If you want to look young,

633
00:25:34,968 --> 00:25:38,640
dab a reddish tone like this.

634
00:25:38,064 --> 00:25:40,365
Now that her lips have color,

635
00:25:40,941 --> 00:25:43,310
she looks lightened up.

636
00:25:43,031 --> 00:25:45,058
I think this line of colors

637
00:25:45,058 --> 00:25:48,861
suits those with dark skin.

638
00:25:49,383 --> 00:25:51,686
Look at this color.

639
00:25:51,686 --> 00:25:53,955
- It really doesn't suit me. / - Pink?

640
00:25:53,955 --> 00:25:56,891
My face looks darker with this color.

641
00:25:56,891 --> 00:25:57,894
If you have dark skin,

642
00:25:58,191 --> 00:26:00,695
you shouldn't wear brownish burgundy.

643
00:26:00,695 --> 00:26:01,996
- Really? / - Your skin looks darker.

644
00:26:01,996 --> 00:26:02,998
You can't tell where the lips are?

645
00:26:03,196 --> 00:26:04,698
You look very ill.

646
00:26:04,698 --> 00:26:06,715
- You look ill? / - That's right.

647
00:26:07,701 --> 00:26:09,670
If you want to add more moisture,

648
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:12,094
apply lip gloss or lip lacquer.

649
00:26:22,183 --> 00:26:24,785
That was a refreshing look.

650
00:26:24,785 --> 00:26:26,812
Now I'll show you an upgraded

651
00:26:27,055 --> 00:26:29,990
edgy, sophisticated look for 7 p.m.

652
00:26:29,099 --> 00:26:30,935
You go on dates around then.

653
00:26:31,826 --> 00:26:34,628
That's when you get off work.

654
00:26:34,628 --> 00:26:36,635
You're hungry and you make dinner plans.

655
00:26:36,698 --> 00:26:36,704
Right.

656
00:26:37,298 --> 00:26:40,701
You can have dinner at a hot place.

657
00:26:40,701 --> 00:26:42,670
I'll use a burgundy shadow.

658
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:44,154
I'll use it as a liner by spraying mist on it.

659
00:26:45,054 --> 00:26:46,489
Dab your brush in it.

660
00:26:46,975 --> 00:26:49,043
I didn't draw a thick line earlier.

661
00:26:49,043 --> 00:26:52,146
So it didn't stand out too much.

662
00:26:52,146 --> 00:26:56,650
You'll have more formal appointments at 7 p.m.

663
00:26:56,065 --> 00:26:57,400
Wow.

664
00:26:57,985 --> 00:27:00,121
The right eye looks so deep.

665
00:27:00,121 --> 00:27:01,756
Watching her...

666
00:27:01,756 --> 00:27:05,893
I think this goes so well with the look

667
00:27:05,893 --> 00:27:08,900
because there's no shading or blush.

668
00:27:08,963 --> 00:27:12,300
The noon look only focused on the lips.

669
00:27:12,003 --> 00:27:13,904
Since the eyes didn't stand out,

670
00:27:14,201 --> 00:27:15,403
it looked innocent.

671
00:27:15,403 --> 00:27:18,406
She only added color to the eyelids,

672
00:27:18,406 --> 00:27:20,808
but they look bigger and sophisticated.

673
00:27:20,808 --> 00:27:23,411
Her impression totally changed.

674
00:27:23,411 --> 00:27:24,545
I'm not sure if it's just me,

675
00:27:24,545 --> 00:27:26,681
but she looks like Son Yejin.

676
00:27:26,681 --> 00:27:28,916
She wears heavy makeup in a scene

677
00:27:28,916 --> 00:27:30,985
in "A Moment To Remember."

678
00:27:30,985 --> 00:27:32,653
I think she looks like her in that scene.

679
00:27:32,653 --> 00:27:34,755
Treat me after the recording is over.

680
00:27:34,755 --> 00:27:36,456
I gave you so many compliments.

681
00:27:36,456 --> 00:27:38,191
I said you're pretty.

682
00:27:38,993 --> 00:27:40,895
Next is 11 o'clock.

683
00:27:40,895 --> 00:27:42,596
- 11 p.m.? / - 11 p.m.

684
00:27:42,596 --> 00:27:45,400
The makeup keeps getting heavier.

685
00:27:45,004 --> 00:27:47,439
When it's 11 p.m., are you just going to

686
00:27:47,835 --> 00:27:49,603
put a lot of makeup on her eyes?

687
00:27:50,638 --> 00:27:52,735
I'll make her look very sexy later.

688
00:27:53,608 --> 00:27:54,609
Really?

689
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:56,376
- 11 p.m.? / - Yes.

690
00:27:56,376 --> 00:27:59,680
This color will be best for 11 p.m.

691
00:27:59,068 --> 00:28:01,271
You'll like it.

692
00:28:01,883 --> 00:28:03,316
You'll need it today.

693
00:28:03,316 --> 00:28:04,151
Since you need to go clubbing.

694
00:28:04,151 --> 00:28:09,223
I think 11 p.m. is when all women, you know...

695
00:28:09,223 --> 00:28:09,229
Keep going.

696
00:28:09,823 --> 00:28:11,870
That's when they start to seduce men.

697
00:28:12,293 --> 00:28:13,561
Though many sleep at that hour too.

698
00:28:13,561 --> 00:28:13,570
At 11 p.m.?

699
00:28:14,461 --> 00:28:17,508
Those who wait for 11 p.m. want to seduce others.

700
00:28:17,931 --> 00:28:19,766
You can seduce them during the day.

701
00:28:19,766 --> 00:28:21,268
You can seduce men in broad daylight?

702
00:28:21,268 --> 00:28:24,295
Sure. What do you do at night?

703
00:28:24,538 --> 00:28:27,175
- The makeup will be sexier? / - Of course.

704
00:28:27,175 --> 00:28:29,276
Since you'll be in a darker space,

705
00:28:29,276 --> 00:28:31,178
you can think of it as

706
00:28:31,178 --> 00:28:34,205
sparkly makeup under subtle lighting.

707
00:28:34,448 --> 00:28:36,485
You're going under the eyes.

708
00:28:36,818 --> 00:28:39,895
Yes, we're getting into club makeup.

709
00:28:40,588 --> 00:28:42,665
Makeup under the eyes looks sexy.

710
00:28:43,358 --> 00:28:44,691
I can't do without makeup there.

711
00:28:44,691 --> 00:28:46,778
I love doing under eye makeup too.

712
00:28:47,561 --> 00:28:49,463
Guys wear under eye makeup too.

713
00:28:49,463 --> 00:28:51,560
It gets crazy on the stage.

714
00:28:52,433 --> 00:28:54,601
I heard guys' makeup takes longer.

715
00:28:54,601 --> 00:28:56,648
I'll cover the top with gray.

716
00:28:57,071 --> 00:29:01,843
You're using gray instead of Marsala?

717
00:29:01,843 --> 00:29:05,580
Yes, if you use too much of Marsala,

718
00:29:05,058 --> 00:29:07,593
you could just look too tough

719
00:29:08,115 --> 00:29:10,351
instead of sexy.

720
00:29:10,351 --> 00:29:12,186
She's ready for clubbing now...

721
00:29:12,186 --> 00:29:14,355
Her eye looks much bigger.

722
00:29:14,355 --> 00:29:15,323
Yeah.

723
00:29:15,323 --> 00:29:19,160
Each side of her face is totally different.

724
00:29:19,016 --> 00:29:20,684
I bet guys like this look.

725
00:29:20,828 --> 00:29:23,431
Guys like innocent, but sexy looks.

726
00:29:23,431 --> 00:29:26,498
Girls that look too sexy, just look scary.

727
00:29:27,101 --> 00:29:29,303
She looks so pretty.

728
00:29:29,303 --> 00:29:30,738
Awesome.

729
00:29:30,738 --> 00:29:33,140
I think the gold shimmer

730
00:29:33,014 --> 00:29:34,615
from the noon makeup

731
00:29:34,741 --> 00:29:36,410
makes her look even prettier.

732
00:29:43,005 --> 00:29:46,041
I've been talking a lot. But shall I try it now?

733
00:29:46,086 --> 00:29:47,555
I bet it'll suit Hyoseong.

734
00:29:47,555 --> 00:29:49,423
Everything looks good on her.

735
00:29:49,423 --> 00:29:50,425
That's a pencil type.

736
00:29:50,425 --> 00:29:51,291
Pencil type.

737
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:53,358
This has a vivid color.

738
00:29:54,828 --> 00:29:57,165
It's a totally different color from hers now.

739
00:29:57,165 --> 00:30:02,436
I'm wearing hot pink lipstick, but I'll remove it.

740
00:30:03,638 --> 00:30:05,573
Is it coming off?

741
00:30:05,573 --> 00:30:07,508
I'm embarrassed now.

742
00:30:07,508 --> 00:30:09,443
I've never done this before.

743
00:30:09,443 --> 00:30:11,378
My mom does that before bed.

744
00:30:13,581 --> 00:30:15,450
She wants to make it clean.

745
00:30:15,045 --> 00:30:16,713
She goes like this.

746
00:30:17,118 --> 00:30:21,690
She leaves it right beside the sofa.

747
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,770
Did you learn makeup from your mom?

748
00:30:26,728 --> 00:30:29,463
I became a beauty show host thanks to her.

749
00:30:36,037 --> 00:30:39,240
I can tell she's an expert

750
00:30:39,573 --> 00:30:41,375
just by looking at her wear it.

751
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:43,382
I'm jealous of her thick lips.

752
00:30:43,445 --> 00:30:45,080
My lips are so thin.

753
00:30:45,008 --> 00:30:47,109
I only wear it inside my lips.

754
00:30:47,181 --> 00:30:49,316
My lips are so thin, I look ugly when I wear those.

755
00:30:53,921 --> 00:30:58,225
I use my hands quite often.

756
00:30:58,225 --> 00:30:59,893
You need to work on the gradient.

757
00:30:59,893 --> 00:31:01,361
Kwanghee doesn't seem to like it.

758
00:31:03,096 --> 00:31:07,168
She looks like an Asian ghost.

759
00:31:07,168 --> 00:31:09,170
It's only in the center.

760
00:31:09,017 --> 00:31:11,452
He's so hilarious.

761
00:31:11,605 --> 00:31:12,706
Stop coming to me.

762
00:31:12,706 --> 00:31:14,941
It's scary only in the center.

763
00:31:14,941 --> 00:31:17,745
He's so hilarious, I'm dying now.

764
00:31:17,745 --> 00:31:19,846
Her lips look like mine now.

765
00:31:19,846 --> 00:31:21,750
Her lips became thin.

766
00:31:21,075 --> 00:31:23,143
Good job, Hyoseong.

767
00:31:30,291 --> 00:31:34,795
Jun Hyoseong is so sexy.

768
00:31:34,795 --> 00:31:36,802
Jun Hyoseong is sexy.

769
00:31:38,131 --> 00:31:40,835
Mix makeup base and foundation

770
00:31:40,835 --> 00:31:43,203
for moist skin.

771
00:31:43,203 --> 00:31:45,540
After curling your eyelashes,

772
00:31:45,054 --> 00:31:48,057
give your lashes a natural extension

773
00:31:48,543 --> 00:31:51,445
with mascara containing black fiber.

774
00:31:51,445 --> 00:31:53,448
If you use eye shadow

775
00:31:53,448 --> 00:31:55,850
combining Marsala lipstick and concealer,

776
00:31:55,085 --> 00:31:59,556
you complete an innocent noon version look.

777
00:32:04,791 --> 00:32:07,095
Spray mist into burgundy shadow and

778
00:32:07,095 --> 00:32:09,230
use it as an eyeliner.

779
00:32:09,023 --> 00:32:11,424
If you add contour at the outer corners

780
00:32:11,631 --> 00:32:13,648
with brownish Marsala shadow,

781
00:32:13,801 --> 00:32:17,638
a deep 7 p.m. version look is complete.

782
00:32:18,773 --> 00:32:21,241
If you draw a black line under the eyes

783
00:32:21,241 --> 00:32:23,298
and use a gray shadow on the eyelids,

784
00:32:23,811 --> 00:32:26,180
a sultry Marsala makeup look

785
00:32:26,018 --> 00:32:27,953
is complete for 11 p.m.

786
00:32:34,121 --> 00:32:36,090
We did the interviews and

787
00:32:36,009 --> 00:32:37,677
finished the beauty class too.

788
00:32:37,758 --> 00:32:39,060
Let's go home now.

789
00:32:39,006 --> 00:32:41,507
No, we still have a lot to do.

790
00:32:41,996 --> 00:32:43,465
This looks interesting.

791
00:32:43,465 --> 00:32:45,100
Global beauty news.

792
00:32:46,968 --> 00:32:49,070
Fast-changing trends.

793
00:32:49,007 --> 00:32:51,208
Trendsetters will give us beauty tips

794
00:32:51,271 --> 00:32:53,908
from all around the world.

795
00:32:53,908 --> 00:32:55,343
Global beauty news

796
00:32:55,343 --> 00:32:57,511
from correspondents on site.

797
00:33:00,115 --> 00:33:03,116
What if Barbara Palvin suddenly pops out?

798
00:33:03,116 --> 00:33:04,518
Saying, "Hello, guys."

799
00:33:07,355 --> 00:33:08,590
Nice.

800
00:33:09,823 --> 00:33:13,160
Hello, viewers of Beauty Bible.

801
00:33:13,828 --> 00:33:16,845
Hello, viewers of Beauty Bible.

802
00:33:17,731 --> 00:33:23,805
This is Japan and my name is Miho.

803
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:27,672
Our very first correspondent is

804
00:33:27,708 --> 00:33:30,745
new YouTuber of Japan, Miho.

805
00:33:30,745 --> 00:33:35,483
I'll introduce the most popular

806
00:33:35,483 --> 00:33:39,086
beauty item in Japan.

807
00:33:39,086 --> 00:33:42,923
It's so popular that they introduced it

808
00:33:42,923 --> 00:33:44,558
on Japanese television.

809
00:33:44,558 --> 00:33:51,131
It's totally sold out now.

810
00:33:55,003 --> 00:33:57,038
I came to a market.

811
00:33:58,138 --> 00:34:00,165
The items are inexpensive there.

812
00:34:01,641 --> 00:34:05,780
It's in the cosmetics section.

813
00:34:14,621 --> 00:34:16,356
They have many interesting items.

814
00:34:16,356 --> 00:34:18,793
You are right.

815
00:34:33,306 --> 00:34:34,383
It's number one product.

816
00:34:35,076 --> 00:34:36,610
This is great.

817
00:34:38,111 --> 00:34:40,448
It must be very popular.

818
00:34:43,585 --> 00:34:45,553
Japanese ladies love this product.

819
00:34:45,553 --> 00:34:47,255
The silicone mask pack.

820
00:34:47,888 --> 00:34:50,905
A popular Japanese YouTuber introduced it.

821
00:34:54,628 --> 00:34:57,265
She got over 100,000 views.

822
00:34:58,866 --> 00:35:01,468
Amidst the flood of positive reviews...

823
00:35:02,027 --> 00:35:05,084
This popular silicone mask pack is

824
00:35:05,084 --> 00:35:08,020
popular among both men and women.

825
00:35:09,343 --> 00:35:11,011
Do you have silicone mask packs?

826
00:35:11,011 --> 00:35:13,815
We don't have any left.

827
00:35:13,815 --> 00:35:15,250
Wow, none left.

828
00:35:15,025 --> 00:35:16,091
It's that popular?

829
00:35:16,316 --> 00:35:20,788
They didn't have any silicone mask packs there.

830
00:35:20,788 --> 00:35:22,885
So I came to a different branch.

831
00:35:34,368 --> 00:35:36,871
- Was this set up? / - None again.

832
00:35:36,871 --> 00:35:40,075
We don't know when it'll come in.

833
00:35:46,781 --> 00:35:49,016
So I came to another place.

834
00:35:49,016 --> 00:35:52,043
I'd better look for silicone mask packs.

835
00:36:07,135 --> 00:36:09,936
It must be here now.

836
00:36:09,936 --> 00:36:11,605
I have a feeling.

837
00:36:19,213 --> 00:36:20,815
You could get angry at those time.

838
00:36:20,815 --> 00:36:23,083
- When you really want to buy it. / - It's annoying.

839
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:24,285
It's exhausting.

840
00:36:24,285 --> 00:36:29,556
Maybe you can't find them in Japan.

841
00:36:29,556 --> 00:36:30,891
Oh, gosh.

842
00:36:30,891 --> 00:36:31,960
Oh, gosh.

843
00:36:31,096 --> 00:36:32,329
Oh, my...

844
00:36:40,435 --> 00:36:41,703
Ta-da!

845
00:36:41,703 --> 00:36:43,438
She got it.

846
00:36:46,808 --> 00:36:50,835
I went for an auction.

847
00:36:52,046 --> 00:36:54,581
It's so expensive.

848
00:36:54,581 --> 00:36:57,118
It's usually about $1 per pack,

849
00:36:57,118 --> 00:36:59,053
but it went up to $4.50.

850
00:36:59,053 --> 00:37:00,321
Through the auction...

851
00:37:01,088 --> 00:37:05,960
Put on sheet mask and then...

852
00:37:06,728 --> 00:37:09,096
Like this.

853
00:37:09,096 --> 00:37:11,193
We used to have to lie down

854
00:37:12,066 --> 00:37:14,235
after applying a facial mask.

855
00:37:14,235 --> 00:37:18,906
It's great because we can move around.

856
00:37:32,012 --> 00:37:35,015
I'm Miho in Japan.

857
00:37:35,123 --> 00:37:38,158
Thank you. Bye!

858
00:37:39,426 --> 00:37:40,395
Awesome. I want that.

859
00:37:40,395 --> 00:37:42,730
I'd like to see that too.

860
00:37:42,073 --> 00:37:43,608
Editors have quick access, right?

861
00:37:44,265 --> 00:37:46,366
We should experience it and

862
00:37:46,366 --> 00:37:47,001
share about it quickly.

863
00:37:47,001 --> 00:37:50,505
I visited a fashion company when I was overseas.

864
00:37:50,505 --> 00:37:52,140
It was insane.

865
00:37:52,014 --> 00:37:54,582
They had all the new products.

866
00:37:54,708 --> 00:37:56,811
People send it to them like that.

867
00:37:56,811 --> 00:37:58,380
How come it's vacant here?

868
00:37:58,038 --> 00:37:59,806
It's because it's the first issue?

869
00:38:00,148 --> 00:38:01,983
It'll be filled up soon.

870
00:38:01,983 --> 00:38:03,150
Something came.

871
00:38:03,015 --> 00:38:04,783
Is it for us?

872
00:38:05,052 --> 00:38:06,887
- Oh, what is it? / - It's from abroad.

873
00:38:07,355 --> 00:38:08,423
It's here!

874
00:38:08,423 --> 00:38:09,356
- It's from Japan. / - For us?

875
00:38:10,858 --> 00:38:11,993
I'm so excited.

876
00:38:13,428 --> 00:38:17,435
We got a letter.

877
00:38:17,498 --> 00:38:19,555
From Writer Lee Sujin.

878
00:38:20,068 --> 00:38:22,836
Lee Sujin removed her makeup

879
00:38:22,836 --> 00:38:27,275
and sent an invoice for the auction.

880
00:38:27,275 --> 00:38:32,713
$4.50 and shipping cost of $20.

881
00:38:32,713 --> 00:38:35,780
She wants a total of $50.

882
00:38:36,383 --> 00:38:40,521
She sent a letter.

883
00:38:40,521 --> 00:38:42,556
- There's one here. / - Just one?

884
00:38:42,556 --> 00:38:45,603
The shape is nice.

885
00:38:48,093 --> 00:38:50,161
I have a lot of silicone in my face too.

886
00:38:54,635 --> 00:38:55,803
Like this...

887
00:38:55,803 --> 00:38:59,440
It's convenient as you can hang it on the ears.

888
00:38:59,044 --> 00:39:01,071
It sticks to the face.

889
00:39:01,071 --> 00:39:02,076
You can move around.

890
00:39:03,021 --> 00:39:05,224
Wow, it doesn't fall off.

891
00:39:05,413 --> 00:39:07,581
You can go like this too.

892
00:39:07,581 --> 00:39:09,783
This is great.

893
00:39:09,783 --> 00:39:12,686
It's tight too. It's very tight.

894
00:39:12,686 --> 00:39:14,555
On the chin too.

895
00:39:14,555 --> 00:39:16,023
A lifting effect.

896
00:39:16,023 --> 00:39:19,160
The liquid wouldn't drip down.

897
00:39:19,016 --> 00:39:19,024
Right.

898
00:39:19,096 --> 00:39:21,732
Many people grind stuff for facial packs.

899
00:39:22,596 --> 00:39:24,231
Things like cucumbers.

900
00:39:24,231 --> 00:39:26,935
This will stop natural packs from dripping.

901
00:39:26,935 --> 00:39:27,936
It's nice.

902
00:39:28,035 --> 00:39:29,236
Oh, my...

903
00:39:30,405 --> 00:39:32,806
Kwanghee wore so much makeup. Look.

904
00:39:32,806 --> 00:39:34,641
Gosh.

905
00:39:34,641 --> 00:39:36,678
It shows how it sticks really well.

906
00:39:37,011 --> 00:39:40,148
Let's look at the instructions.

907
00:39:45,012 --> 00:39:45,019
What?

908
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:48,119
The literal translation is this.

909
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:51,454
"You can use this pad

910
00:39:51,625 --> 00:39:54,128
and move or sleep as you wish."

911
00:39:55,996 --> 00:39:58,053
When you use it in the bath...

912
00:39:58,566 --> 00:40:00,968
- It's very effective. It works. / - Yes.

913
00:40:00,968 --> 00:40:02,736
It must be great for baths.

914
00:40:02,736 --> 00:40:04,605
It has a great steaming effect.

915
00:40:04,605 --> 00:40:06,672
Do they sell this in Korea too?

916
00:40:07,275 --> 00:40:10,292
I've used a silicone pack before.

917
00:40:10,445 --> 00:40:14,462
I applied serum and then put on the silicone pack.

918
00:40:14,615 --> 00:40:17,652
I could move around since it didn't fall off,

919
00:40:17,985 --> 00:40:20,421
but it was expensive.

920
00:40:20,421 --> 00:40:22,390
How many times can you use this?

921
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:25,542
It says it's semipermanent.

922
00:40:25,893 --> 00:40:28,028
I don't think you can use this

923
00:40:28,028 --> 00:40:29,996
many times by keeping it clean.

924
00:40:29,996 --> 00:40:33,568
I think you can replace it once a month.

925
00:40:33,568 --> 00:40:36,336
Kwanghee made it a bit dirty.

926
00:40:36,336 --> 00:40:37,138
You want it?

927
00:40:37,138 --> 00:40:39,225
No, I'd rather just order another one.

928
00:40:40,008 --> 00:40:40,016
From now on...

929
00:40:40,808 --> 00:40:42,476
Your mark is so vivid.

930
00:40:42,476 --> 00:40:42,484
Whenever there are samples,

931
00:40:43,276 --> 00:40:45,513
I'll try it and keep it.

932
00:40:45,513 --> 00:40:47,681
- I'd better try it first. / - Right.

933
00:40:47,681 --> 00:40:49,383
We need a title for this too.

934
00:40:49,383 --> 00:40:50,285
For this too?

935
00:40:50,885 --> 00:40:52,952
We need to add "Limited," "Sold out."

936
00:40:53,555 --> 00:40:55,623
"Exclusive! Only on Beauty Bible!

937
00:40:55,623 --> 00:40:57,991
Silicone pack that Japan goes nuts about."

938
00:40:57,991 --> 00:40:59,260
Sounds good.

939
00:40:59,026 --> 00:41:00,261
That sums it up.

940
00:41:00,495 --> 00:41:02,096
- "Nearly sold out." / - Important words...

941
00:41:02,096 --> 00:41:02,830
Say it all.

942
00:41:02,083 --> 00:41:03,884
No. "Already sold out."

943
00:41:04,631 --> 00:41:05,633
"Already sold out?"

944
00:41:06,533 --> 00:41:09,170
Hot beauty item straight from Japan.

945
00:41:10,305 --> 00:41:12,106
Silicone mask packs.

946
00:41:15,943 --> 00:41:17,145
There's one left now, right?

947
00:41:17,145 --> 00:41:19,813
Will a fitness instructor come?

948
00:41:19,813 --> 00:41:21,648
I think so.

949
00:41:21,648 --> 00:41:24,151
I hope she comes. The popular instructor.

950
00:41:24,151 --> 00:41:24,159
- Who? / - Who?

951
00:41:24,951 --> 00:41:26,153
You know.

952
00:41:26,153 --> 00:41:27,455
Yu Seungok.

953
00:41:34,195 --> 00:41:35,730
Maybe Yu Seungok is coming.

954
00:41:35,073 --> 00:41:36,006
I hope...

955
00:41:37,131 --> 00:41:38,098
She's here.

956
00:41:38,098 --> 00:41:41,001
- Excuse me. / - She must be here.

957
00:41:41,435 --> 00:41:43,103
What if it's not her?

958
00:41:43,103 --> 00:41:45,706
I bet it's a male instructor.

959
00:41:46,573 --> 00:41:47,641
Gosh.

960
00:41:47,641 --> 00:41:49,776
I shouldn't have given him cologne.

961
00:41:55,065 --> 00:41:57,033
I hope she comes. The popular instructor.

962
00:41:57,618 --> 00:41:58,420
- Who? / - Who?

963
00:41:58,042 --> 00:41:59,175
You know.

964
00:41:59,553 --> 00:42:00,721
Yu Seungok.

965
00:42:03,691 --> 00:42:03,700
She's here.

966
00:42:04,591 --> 00:42:06,608
- Excuse me. / - She must be here.

967
00:42:08,328 --> 00:42:09,363
Gosh.

968
00:42:09,363 --> 00:42:11,398
I shouldn't have given him cologne.

969
00:42:12,266 --> 00:42:12,933
What the...

970
00:42:12,933 --> 00:42:14,335
What is it? Who is it?

971
00:42:14,335 --> 00:42:15,836
What is this?

972
00:42:15,836 --> 00:42:16,805
What is this?

973
00:42:16,805 --> 00:42:19,573
What's with the remote control?

974
00:42:19,573 --> 00:42:22,110
They want us to watch it on the screen?

975
00:42:22,011 --> 00:42:23,446
- What is this? / - Geez.

976
00:42:32,653 --> 00:42:34,855
It doesn't feel good for me at all.

977
00:42:34,855 --> 00:42:36,190
My arms hurt so much.

978
00:42:38,526 --> 00:42:40,395
I can't help but moan.

979
00:42:40,728 --> 00:42:42,030
What should we watch?

980
00:42:43,631 --> 00:42:45,533
Hello. I'm Song Daeun.

981
00:42:45,533 --> 00:42:46,466
Hello.

982
00:42:47,268 --> 00:42:49,603
Hello. I'm Song Daeun.

983
00:42:49,603 --> 00:42:52,206
I'll teach you workouts you can do at home

984
00:42:52,206 --> 00:42:55,243
with simple items in your house.

985
00:42:55,576 --> 00:42:56,576
For 4 weeks...

986
00:42:56,576 --> 00:42:58,045
- For 4 weeks? / - In 4 weeks.

987
00:42:58,045 --> 00:42:58,613
Four weeks.

988
00:42:58,613 --> 00:43:01,581
I'll teach you how to make

989
00:43:01,581 --> 00:43:05,120
a perfect body to seduce a guy in 4 weeks.

990
00:43:05,012 --> 00:43:09,115
I'll teach you how to make a pretty neck...

991
00:43:09,223 --> 00:43:10,891
- And collarbones. / - That's important.

992
00:43:10,891 --> 00:43:12,860
You all have towels, right?

993
00:43:12,086 --> 00:43:15,133
We'll start making a pretty neck and collarbones

994
00:43:16,033 --> 00:43:17,234
with the towels right now.

995
00:43:17,531 --> 00:43:19,133
I'll pause and bring towels now.

996
00:43:19,133 --> 00:43:20,268
I'll bring them.

997
00:43:20,268 --> 00:43:20,935
We have towels?

998
00:43:20,935 --> 00:43:22,470
There must be in the bathroom.

999
00:43:22,047 --> 00:43:23,648
He knows everything.

1000
00:43:25,064 --> 00:43:26,499
Pick your favorite color.

1001
00:43:29,071 --> 00:43:30,639
Prepare your towels.

1002
00:43:32,346 --> 00:43:34,415
Fold your towels twice horizontally.

1003
00:43:34,415 --> 00:43:36,316
Move your elbow forward.

1004
00:43:36,316 --> 00:43:37,818
As you breathe in and exhale,

1005
00:43:37,818 --> 00:43:40,455
move both arms to the right.

1006
00:43:40,455 --> 00:43:43,552
Tilt your head far to the left.

1007
00:43:47,395 --> 00:43:50,298
Do the same for the opposite side.

1008
00:43:50,298 --> 00:43:52,466
Do it slowly as you breathe.

1009
00:43:52,466 --> 00:43:54,601
I can feel the stretch on the back of my neck.

1010
00:43:54,601 --> 00:43:55,603
It feels so good.

1011
00:43:57,938 --> 00:43:59,440
It feels so good.

1012
00:44:00,708 --> 00:44:02,476
I think it's a good arm workout too.

1013
00:44:02,476 --> 00:44:05,813
It relaxes your muscles. It really works.

1014
00:44:05,813 --> 00:44:07,948
I think I'm doing it wrong.

1015
00:44:07,948 --> 00:44:09,955
It doesn't feel good for me at all.

1016
00:44:10,018 --> 00:44:11,285
- Look. / - Hold it.

1017
00:44:11,285 --> 00:44:13,332
Do it like this.

1018
00:44:13,755 --> 00:44:15,390
Tilt your head this way.

1019
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:17,640
Don't your muscles feel the stretch?

1020
00:44:17,991 --> 00:44:18,993
Yeah.

1021
00:44:19,926 --> 00:44:22,063
How did you end up with such a good figure?

1022
00:44:23,965 --> 00:44:28,636
Next, stretch your elbows back as you inhale.

1023
00:44:28,636 --> 00:44:29,770
Lift up your chin

1024
00:44:29,077 --> 00:44:32,013
and stretch out the front of your neck.

1025
00:44:32,706 --> 00:44:35,723
The towel should be tight.

1026
00:44:35,876 --> 00:44:37,411
Don't drop it.

1027
00:44:37,411 --> 00:44:40,418
As you exhale, stretch out your elbows.

1028
00:44:40,481 --> 00:44:42,483
Curl your body into a ball

1029
00:44:42,483 --> 00:44:44,580
and face your belly button.

1030
00:44:45,453 --> 00:44:47,688
The key is to tighten the area

1031
00:44:47,688 --> 00:44:49,956
around your collarbones.

1032
00:44:53,226 --> 00:44:54,461
Hyoseong.

1033
00:44:55,003 --> 00:44:56,536
Hyoseong.

1034
00:44:56,563 --> 00:44:58,966
Exhale and tighten your collarbones.

1035
00:44:58,966 --> 00:45:00,468
Yes.

1036
00:45:01,035 --> 00:45:03,070
Is she watching me? Scary!

1037
00:45:03,007 --> 00:45:04,142
Next.

1038
00:45:04,205 --> 00:45:07,041
Twist your towel 90° to the right

1039
00:45:07,041 --> 00:45:10,845
and tilt your head to the left as you exhale.

1040
00:45:17,385 --> 00:45:21,121
Do the same for the opposite side.

1041
00:45:25,096 --> 00:45:27,163
As you inhale and then exhale,

1042
00:45:28,063 --> 00:45:30,764
bend your elbows at a 90° angle

1043
00:45:31,331 --> 00:45:33,378
and slightly lift your chin.

1044
00:45:33,801 --> 00:45:37,505
Feel the stretch all around

1045
00:45:37,505 --> 00:45:41,108
your neck and collarbones too.

1046
00:45:44,345 --> 00:45:46,513
I can't help but moan.

1047
00:45:46,513 --> 00:45:48,550
Start from now on.

1048
00:45:48,883 --> 00:45:51,651
Let's do this for 3 minutes.

1049
00:45:56,156 --> 00:45:59,160
It feels great.

1050
00:46:00,495 --> 00:46:02,563
Don't you feel the stretch?

1051
00:46:03,865 --> 00:46:05,800
The opposite side too.

1052
00:46:05,009 --> 00:46:07,086
- Now... / - Front pull.

1053
00:46:08,067 --> 00:46:10,968
To the chest.

1054
00:46:12,606 --> 00:46:14,841
Finally, bend your chest.

1055
00:46:14,841 --> 00:46:16,858
- It really hurts. / - Yeah.

1056
00:46:18,211 --> 00:46:21,348
Exhale, now like a cat.

1057
00:46:22,183 --> 00:46:24,351
You're good like you're on the catwalk.

1058
00:46:24,351 --> 00:46:26,486
You're good since you do this pose often.

1059
00:46:26,486 --> 00:46:29,723
Who does that on the catwalk?

1060
00:46:29,723 --> 00:46:31,125
Your head...

1061
00:46:31,125 --> 00:46:33,193
Oh, that's fast.

1062
00:46:36,965 --> 00:46:38,700
My hands are shaking.

1063
00:46:38,007 --> 00:46:39,240
Me too.

1064
00:46:39,933 --> 00:46:40,935
Right?

1065
00:46:40,935 --> 00:46:42,170
It feels so good.

1066
00:46:42,017 --> 00:46:44,752
It's so soothing.

1067
00:46:44,905 --> 00:46:46,306
So soothing.

1068
00:46:49,143 --> 00:46:52,180
My neck feels so much better.

1069
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:54,686
I feel like a giraffe already.

1070
00:46:54,848 --> 00:46:55,816
Me too.

1071
00:46:55,816 --> 00:46:57,651
My neck is already longer.

1072
00:46:57,651 --> 00:46:59,586
Already? After just 3 minutes?

1073
00:46:59,586 --> 00:47:01,613
I feel like it went up like this.

1074
00:47:01,856 --> 00:47:01,861
Really?

1075
00:47:02,356 --> 00:47:04,925
Let's keep it real, Kwanghee.

1076
00:47:04,925 --> 00:47:06,593
She said invest a month, right?

1077
00:47:06,593 --> 00:47:08,650
A longer neck in 4 minutes and 40 seconds...

1078
00:47:09,163 --> 00:47:10,665
Collarbones... No way.

1079
00:47:10,665 --> 00:47:12,500
No way. It's not a surgical procedure.

1080
00:47:12,005 --> 00:47:13,206
I know.
