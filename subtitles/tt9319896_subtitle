1
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,900
'Today, Pollachi'

2
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,100
Sir, we are speaking in Ramapattinam

3
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,260
A theft case
We caught one boy

4
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,420
Control two on static walkie-talkie

5
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,460
Who's on night rounds
in Aathu Pollachi?

6
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,300
Please respond

7
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,060
- Madam, Sathyamurthy here
- Is someone there with you?

8
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,180
Yes, ma'am

9
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,580
A man called Mani has called from
the outskirts of Nithilapuram

10
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,380
- Where are you?
- We're nearby

11
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,940
- Please check and call for back up
- Okay

12
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,540
No peace even on a Sunday

13
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,940
Disturbing us at two in the morning

14
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,140
Didn't we sign up for this?
Let's see what's going on

15
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,340
Fine, drive there

16
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,140
- Is this the house?
- I think so

17
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,580
This looks like a ghost house

18
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,460
True

19
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,980
Surprising to see a house
like this out here

20
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,620
Fine, let's get this over with.
You stay in the car

21
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,780
Okay, sir

22
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,780
Open up, it's the Police!

23
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,940
Open up!

24
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,620
We might have to do it our way

25
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,940
How did the door open on its own?

26
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,860
Come

27
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,620
Is someone there?

28
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,540
Come out!

29
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:55,400
I said, come out

30
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,980
What was that sound?

31
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,340
Open the cupboard

32
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,540
Sir?

33
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,500
- Go on
- I'm scared, sir

34
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,540
Stupid cat!

35
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,060
Sir, what is that sound?

36
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,180
- Sir, let's not go further
- We'll see what it is

37
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,780
- I think someone's just switched it on
- What?

38
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,780
Yes sir

39
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,220
- Inform the Station
- Okay sir

40
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,380
Who's that?

41
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,260
- Sir, I can't run
- Come on...

42
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,660
What is all this?

43
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:39,300
Sir, I'm scared.
Let's leave

44
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,340
- Call for backup
- Yes, sir

45
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,500
We aren't getting signal

46
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:13,780
Start the car!

47
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,980
Hurry, let's go!

48
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,260
Three months ago,
Chennai

49
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,660
Idiot

50
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,780
Sorry madam.
Idiot!

51
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,300
Can't you see?

52
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,660
Sorry...
Idiot!

53
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,380
Brainless idiot!

54
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,220
Sorry madam, my mistake

55
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,180
- Dad, where are you?
- At the restaurant

56
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,540
- Floor?
- Tenth

57
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,740
Okay!

58
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,900
She's not here yet

59
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,380
She's here!

60
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,340
- Handle her carefully
- I'll take care

61
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,780
Hi darling, come sit

62
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,740
Why did you call me urgently?

63
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,580
You remember my friend Somasekar?

64
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,340
Adi, his son.
Very nice chap

65
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,660
He's here on leave from the US

66
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,220
We thought we could get
the two of you to meet

67
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,740
I've told you a million times that
I don't want to get married now

68
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,540
Will you ever understand?

69
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,380
- Hello uncle
- Welcome son

70
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,700
- Hi, Aunty
- Hi

71
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,660
Is this Yamuna?

72
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,940
Yes, my daughter

73
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,220
We didn't inform Yamuna about this

74
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,740
- Hence the mild surprise on her face
- Mild?

75
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,100
So what?

76
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,380
Aren't candid conversations better?

77
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,220
Yes...yes

78
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,180
So darling, shall we take off?
You guys chat

79
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,860
- Yes, let's leave
- Mom?

80
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,740
All the best

81
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,380
Come

82
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,940
Darling, talk carefully

83
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,620
- Okay, bye
- Okay

84
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,220
So Yamuna?
Tell me about yourself

85
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,140
Mr Adi, this is a misunderstanding

86
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,060
I'm not interested in marriage

87
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,380
My parents arranged this meeting
by mistake

88
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,420
Works perfect for me

89
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:41,180
I don't buy into marriage and monogamy

90
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,140
We only live once.
And youth? Just 15 or 20 years

91
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,740
Let's just get married

92
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,580
We don't have to live with each other

93
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,540
No pressure.
What do you say?

94
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,460
Look Mr Adi, thanks for the offer

95
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,140
True, I'm not interested in marriage

96
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,420
But an arrangement like this?
No!

97
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,420
I saw your Facebook photos

98
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,060
Office mates, boys, office party

99
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:08,300
You can do whatever you're doing now,
after marriage as well

100
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,780
What do you say?

101
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,500
You're leaving?

102
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,900
Aren't you in the Media?

103
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,860
I'm sure you must have had to
sleep around to be in this position

104
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,660
Why are you over- reacting?

105
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:25,540
You want to get married
and then sleep around

106
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:28,060
And if I refuse?
You shame me for it

107
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:33,780
Women who want to support their family
are crippled by men like you!

108
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,620
I think your parents' retirement pension
was wasted on your abroad education

109
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,820
They should've spent that on
rearing 15 pigs instead!

110
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,580
I have another qualm with them

111
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,740
Why they named you Adi
instead of shoddy

112
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,460
Stupid

113
00:11:25,219 --> 00:11:29,979
"Are you made of your desires
or are you in disguise?"

114
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,660
"Or the physical embodiment
or a delusion?"

115
00:11:32,722 --> 00:11:36,968
"Are you made of your
happiness or sorrow?"

116
00:11:37,024 --> 00:11:40,134
"Or the sum of your thoughts?"

117
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:47,380
"Questions are many
Your life is the answer"

118
00:11:47,444 --> 00:11:54,915
"Your life is the extension
of the seeds you sowed"

119
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:57,675
"Oh girl! Oh dear girl!"

120
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:02,371
"Where are you going
leaving your traces?"

121
00:12:02,419 --> 00:12:04,746
"Oh girl! Oh dear girl!"

122
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:10,074
"Will you see
who is driving you?"

123
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:21,180
"Who is she? Who is the other girl?
Or both different?"

124
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,369
"Where are you going?"

125
00:12:24,428 --> 00:12:29,388
"Search is on
Even after death"

126
00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:31,709
"It is time to wake up"

127
00:12:31,757 --> 00:12:35,322
"When the eyes open
You will appear"

128
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:39,100
"My shadow trails you
Where are you off to?"

129
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:42,729
"None asked for your desire
None supported you"

130
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:47,658
"None wiped your tears
Answer me, oh girl!"

131
00:12:47,707 --> 00:12:51,547
"Youâ€™re seeking your destiny
Oh girl!"

132
00:12:51,579 --> 00:12:54,059
"Youâ€™re seeking your destiny
Oh girl!"

133
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,540
"Your body, my soul,
your sorrow, my happiness"

134
00:12:57,587 --> 00:13:01,160
"It is time for us to mingle
Come to join"

135
00:13:01,206 --> 00:13:04,097
"Oh girl! Oh dear girl!"

136
00:13:04,144 --> 00:13:07,769
"Where are you going
leaving your traces?"

137
00:13:08,738 --> 00:13:11,167
"Oh girl! Oh dear girl!"

138
00:13:11,213 --> 00:13:13,908
"Will you see
who is driving you?"

139
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,100
'White Elephant'

140
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,220
I've been married for five years

141
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,460
Okay?

142
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,340
We have two kids.
Okay...

143
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:54,020
But he has never kissed me so far

144
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,500
What!

145
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,300
Which one, sir?

146
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,340
- Okay
- Okay sir

147
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,300
See if you can use this on the cover

148
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,860
Let's not delay this.
Mail it soon, okay?

149
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:11,740
What's with the fierce walk?

150
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:17,180
I feel like I've lived a lifetime
answering all these questions

151
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,660
I'm really tired, sir

152
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,420
Inspite of your disinterest,
you are doing a great job

153
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,460
Accept it

154
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,620
You have a fandom of people
eagerly waiting to read your answers

155
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,460
Your fans

156
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,500
You think?

157
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:31,980
They read my answers, go home
and still fight with their wives

158
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:36,300
Why don't we start a YouTube channel
for our newspaper?

159
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,860
Daily news, live reports,
movie reviews...

160
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,220
We could even do a video version
of this advice column

161
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,660
Our viewership will increase,
we can go across the globe!

162
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,860
We could earn too!
People's mail 2.0. How's that?

163
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,540
YouTube?
This isn't time pass

164
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,740
Let's not get into the internet farce
and spoil our reputation

165
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,580
YouTube isn't cheap like you think

166
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,220
- Even BBC...
- Stop it Yamuna!

167
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,580
YouTube is just a phase

168
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:59,980
Everyone will jump on
the bandwagon now

169
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,540
Overdo it and then it will
die down in a few years

170
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,620
We're not getting into it,
end of story

171
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,340
- Hello?
- Can you come home soon today?

172
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,300
- Why?
- Come home, you'll see

173
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,620
Fine, I'll be there

174
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,460
- What happened?
- Looks like an accident

175
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,540
Let's go

176
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:17,740
- Congratulations, darling!
- Congratulations, Yamuna!

177
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,380
Have some sweet

178
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,940
What's all this?

179
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,740
Adi has agreed to the marriage

180
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:28,660
He said he'd been looking for
a girl like you all his life

181
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,620
He said, you enlightened him.
What did you say?

182
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,180
- Tell me
- What did you say?

183
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:36,220
Anyway, mom and I are ecstatic!

184
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:40,580
I can boast that I got my daughter
married before my retirement

185
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,180
And guess what?

186
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:46,580
Adi is here only for 40 days.
So we should have the wedding soon

187
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,300
We're so happy, you know?

188
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,420
You're happy, right?

189
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,180
We're all happy then!

190
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:03,140
We're very happy that you've
finally agreed to this marriage

191
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,460
It's late, get up

192
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,180
Yamuna!

193
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,260
Darling!

194
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,260
Where is our daughter?

195
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,380
I'm scared

196
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,460
She must have gone
to a friend's place

197
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,700
Don't be scared

198
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,700
We'll call her friends and check

199
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,180
Give me the balance, we will leave

200
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:35,500
You did a shoddy job.
I can't pay you!

201
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,780
One room is still unpainted

202
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,780
Just take whatever we give you

203
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,300
Mani, settle his payment

204
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,260
I should slap myself for
taking up this job

205
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:43,900
Correct!

206
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,060
- Who will he slap?
- Maid will be here at seven

207
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:50,780
Did he say that to you?
I'll whack him with a broom

208
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,900
Is he auctioning your house?
Everyone's been insulting us

209
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,100
Doesn't the matter

210
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,620
This gentleman seems to be
appreciating us

211
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,180
He said he'll slap you!

212
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,100
- I saw him paint. Did you?
- I am blind. How can I...

213
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,140
Then, shut up your mouth

214
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,940
I said I will slap myself

215
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,900
Just pay me and I'll leave

216
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,340
He's talking like a cheapo
and you're supporting him

217
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,380
Except for one room I've
painted everything else!

218
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,940
Just pay me and I'll go

219
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,380
Just give him Rs.500 and send him off

220
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:20,460
Why should we pay him that much?

221
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:24,100
You think you have a lot of money?
I won't pay you so much

222
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,260
I can give you only Rs.5000

223
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,860
No, don't give him that much!

224
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:32,020
- Take this and leave
- Wear your hearing aid, fatso!

225
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,940
- Don't give him that...
- I didn't hear anything

226
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:40,180
To win in a fight, you need to
tune out the other person

227
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,100
I let my cable loose and
let him run loose, see that?

228
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,420
- Come on guys
- Seems like he's in a hurry

229
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:50,420
I asked you to give him Rs.500
and you gave him Rs.5000!

230
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,420
I thought you asked me to
give him Rs.50,000

231
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:58,100
I can't see, you can't hear!
You will be the death of me

232
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,940
- You'll send me to the streets
- Stop it!

233
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,700
Go check the pressure cooker

234
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:06,500
You're the one who works for me!
Dumbo

235
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,060
No eyesight and she still
spits with aim

236
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,100
Who is she?

237
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,740
God's given her a one- sided face

238
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:15,700
Yamuna! Granddaughter's here to
add to the trouble

239
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,500
- What's the problem here?
- Good respect

240
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:22,260
Painting has to be done once a year.
Grandma makes it all year long

241
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,500
She pinpoints mistakes and
the painters lash out on me

242
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:27,180
- We have one room left
- Shall I paint it?

243
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,180
Are you an artist?

244
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,100
- Should I call Picasso to paint this?
- Who's that Picasso?

245
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:33,980
Keep the bag

246
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,060
Tell Grandma I'm home

247
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,020
Is he a bigger artist than
our 'Underpants' Murugan?

248
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,540
Now I need to find a way to get
Granny's property

249
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,140
Stop the ball

250
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,300
- Just sunglasses for me?
- Come in, baby girl

251
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,900
I've missed this house...

252
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,700
And I miss caressing
my granddaughter!

253
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,740
Parvathy!

254
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,340
Until now, she told me
I'm her whole world

255
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,860
The moment you came,
I'm forgotten

256
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,700
I had to scrub her back like
a Buffalo's every day

257
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,220
Fatso, I'll place a bomb in your
momos next time

258
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,820
Go, do your job

259
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,340
- I will eat that too
- I'm sure you will

260
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,940
Do you still do embroidery?

261
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,620
Born with the skill,
won't stop until I die

262
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,180
I've been waiting for that death

263
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,860
The funeral contractor
calls me everyday...

264
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,740
Music, flowers, dancers
everything's ready

265
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,060
- Hey!
- You can dance too

266
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,020
How did your dad allow you here?

267
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,060
I took off without a word

268
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,580
Why? Any problem?

269
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,340
That's a big flashback

270
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:41,220
Forget that, I'm very hungry.
Give me something to eat

271
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,420
Give me ten minutes

272
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,540
Okay

273
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,540
I saw you both in this area

274
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,340
Not us

275
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,980
Give him some money
and send him off

276
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,300
Find someone to take over his job

277
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,500
Don't call me for such petty jobs

278
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,420
Need your attendance for
the next 15 days. Understood?

279
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,620
Okay, sir

280
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,620
Good morning!

281
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,860
I will kill you now!
Murderer!

282
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,940
- Leave him...
- I will kill you right now!

283
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,980
Why are you letting him off?

284
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,020
Everyone knows his Lorry
did the accident

285
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,220
We're not letting him off.
You calm down

286
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,900
He's just going out on bail

287
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,140
You leave now

288
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,020
Face this in Court when
the hearing comes up

289
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,340
You leave.

290
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,780
Her pancakes look like donuts

291
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,660
But she keeps her face as if
she's a catering genius

292
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:49,180
Even after all your abuse,
that guy agreed to marry you?

293
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,740
My question too.

294
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,740
Do you know how difficult it is
to find a girl these days?

295
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,180
I know the pain

296
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,780
No wonder he agreed in spite
of all your abuse

297
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,140
You, give me two pancakes

298
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,660
You had seventeen pancakes
without a drop of water

299
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,820
Is that a stomach or a well?

300
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,420
Get lost before I whack you

301
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,900
Seventeen pancakes?

302
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,060
She can't see but she can keep count

303
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,860
Look at your face!
Looks like a mixer grinder

304
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,220
And yours too.

305
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:15,060
I'm leaving the rest in the fridge,
don't eat it off

306
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,940
- I'm going home, he'll be alone
- Wash your hands

307
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,380
I will wash it at my own house

308
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,180
Who's that?

309
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,060
His dearest son

310
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,060
You'll see him tomorrow

311
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,980
Have one more darling

312
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,340
I'm done

313
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,580
Hold on for a minute

314
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,580
- What are you doing?
- Warding off the evil eyes

315
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,940
Spit on this

316
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:41,140
I've left sweets on the table.
Take some

317
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,380
No way! I'm loaded

318
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:46,540
If you speak of dieting in
grandma's house, I'll get angry

319
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,300
If you make me eat this much everyday...

320
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,940
...I will become a pig for
slaughter in two months

321
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,460
I have to go jogging in the morning

322
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,100
- Take Mani along
- Okay

323
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,860
- Yamuna?
- Yes mom

324
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,060
Where are you?

325
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,980
Why do you come home drunk
every night?

326
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:41,420
Hereafter, I won't drink

327
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,220
I swear I won't drink

328
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,660
Don't cry

329
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,220
Is this a house or a temple door?

330
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:25,260
- Mani?
- Where is Yamuna?

331
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,540
Good morning

332
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,500
What is this?

333
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,620
I switched off the TV

334
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,620
I've seen Salman Khan,
I've seen Shahrukh Khan

335
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,740
But this is the first time
I'm seeing both in one person

336
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:46,580
Correct, we'll come back
from jogging and have Tiffin

337
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:49,380
Grandma is making rice cakes and
coconut chutney.

338
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,780
You don't like?

339
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,460
Lunatic!

340
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,260
Where did I keep the hearing aid?

341
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,820
Hi, good morning!

342
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,980
Why is she saying good morning now?
Anyways, good morning!

343
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,220
You sleep

344
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:03,980
Let's go

345
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,260
Warning, I will run a little very fast

346
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,540
If you can't keep up, stay right there

347
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,820
Or, take a share auto and return

348
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:12,100
- I'll try and match your speed, go on
- Worry not, we'll have Tiffin together

349
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,740
Why is she running so fast?

350
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,300
I'm getting palpitations already

351
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,140
Yamuna!

352
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,660
Not able to keep up?

353
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,620
Stay right here for your share auto

354
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,140
No, hold on

355
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:27,340
I just thought walking is a
nicer option in this weather

356
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,740
Come, let's walk

357
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,260
Secret's out

358
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:35,060
Why did you come here
all of a sudden?

359
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,820
Is it just for Grandma...

360
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,860
...or for someone in yellow t- shirt?

361
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:38,820
Hey!

362
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,180
I love grandma

363
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,380
I will go strangle her first

364
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,180
But your grandma likes me better,
you know?

365
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,820
Right, I saw that

366
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,980
What do you think of me?

367
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,580
Why should I think of you?

368
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:56,060
A handsome hunk like me...

369
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,700
...won't girls like you want to
snatch me away?

370
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,900
No, we won't

371
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,140
Why not?

372
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:05,260
My plans to acquire granny's assets
all depend on her...

373
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,140
- Yamuna!
- I've heard your mind voice

374
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,540
Zip it and speed up

375
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,340
What's your name?

376
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,500
Babloo

377
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,900
Where's your mom & dad?

378
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,580
In the city.
Uncle takes care of me

379
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,860
Is Mani your uncle?

380
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:32,220
Playing football like a champ

381
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:36,340
If Maradona was a woman,
he would be like her

382
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,420
What a player!

383
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,180
Funny girl

384
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,020
Hey, brother

385
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,940
Yes, sir?

386
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,380
Where were you last night?

387
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,580
I was home

388
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,420
Are you alone?

389
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,060
Yes, why?

390
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,260
The lorry driver you threatened
is dead!

391
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,940
When? How?

392
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,980
He slipped and fell from the terrace

393
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,020
We think it's an accident

394
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:27,060
Wanted to confirm your whereabouts,
considering the scene you created

395
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,020
Don't skip town

396
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,500
Until this death is confirmed
to be an accident...

397
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,580
...we might call you in for enquiry

398
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:34,420
Sure, sir

399
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,540
Come

400
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:42,020
Lorry driver slips from
the terrace and dies

401
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,740
Let this paint box cover his coffin

402
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,860
Hey, what is this?

403
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,140
Fuller's Earth

404
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,900
- Why?
- Fair and lovely skin

405
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,100
I'll teach you my beauty tricks soon

406
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,620
Staring at the wall to hang
granny's photo?

407
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,820
- Should I arrange the garland?
- Leave that and go

408
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,700
I forgot what I came for

409
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,780
Where did I leave it after
washing the Buffalo?

410
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,100
What are you looking for?

411
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:04,260
I have to scrub Grandma's back,
looking for the loofah

412
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,740
Here it is, found it!

413
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:09,220
I left her face down and came up,
Let me finish my duty and come back

414
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,860
One loofah, two Buffalos

415
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,860
Lunatic

416
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,820
- Heard you're in- charge. Name?
- Geetha

417
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,380
- You've worked here for?
- Two to three years

418
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,020
How long has the deceased - Mohit
been coming here?

419
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,540
He's a regular customer.
Sir, excuse me

420
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,380
Have you noted?

421
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:53,460
All sorted, her PF will be
cleared in ten days

422
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,940
- What's going on?
- Haven't heard the news?

423
00:32:56,020 --> 00:33:00,180
Room number 701, Mohit Agarwal.
Owner of a beer company

424
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:03,700
Drunk, he fell from the terrace
and died

425
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,980
Has the habit of misbehaving
with our staff

426
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,940
Anyway, karma has served him right

427
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,220
Are you okay Amudhan?

428
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,820
Yes sir, coming

429
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,140
Excuse me!

430
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:11,460
Come in, baby girl.
Still awake?

431
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,940
Is she beautiful?

432
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:25,420
Whenever I think of you, I play this
video and hear the joy we had

433
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:35,300
You were a very naughty kid

434
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,740
But your father was short-tempered

435
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,380
He's not like that anymore

436
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:42,820
No father shows his anger
towards his daughter

437
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:47,100
Do you know how happy we were
when you were born?

438
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:50,700
Your dad and mom outdid each other
in celebrating the occasion

439
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:53,420
We invited the whole town for lunch

440
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,540
That was the last time
we were all together

441
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,860
You left that day and never returned

442
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,180
God knows whose jealous eyes
lead to that

443
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,540
Forget the past, Grandma

444
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,100
I will make sure dad comes
and meets you. Promise!

445
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,300
Okay?

446
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,940
CCTV?

447
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,180
Yes, yes

448
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,900
But you can't see!

449
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:36,540
My tiger champs will take care of that

450
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:40,060
Cats for surveillance!

451
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,620
Grandma, you're a genius!

452
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,940
I gave them water already

453
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,740
Wonder why they're still purring?

454
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,300
What happened?

455
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,260
What happened?

456
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,420
Yamuna

457
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,420
You got scared of the cats?

458
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,660
Don't be. They're harmless...

459
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,300
What is it?

460
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,580
Yamuna

461
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,340
Darling?

462
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,020
Yamuna

463
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,180
Yamuna

464
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:29,780
What happened?

465
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:32,940
Nothing

466
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:35,300
I got scared!

467
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,700
Sir!

468
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,180
I want to meet Arivu

469
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:51,820
Which one?

470
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,260
Head Constable Arivu

471
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,740
He's not in today

472
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,900
Has he come?

473
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,500
No, he hasn't.
Come back tomorrow

474
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,220
What are you saying?

475
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,820
Arivu fell from the terrace.
He's dead!

476
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,060
What?

477
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,820
- Really?
- Yes

478
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:35,660
No! Rewind the video

479
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,700
There's a ghost behind you!

480
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:49,820
I'm leaving this house immediately!

481
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,340
I'm the only heir in my family

482
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,100
What's going on?

483
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,780
There's a ghost in your house,
let's leave!

484
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,780
Why do you look doped?

485
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:58,300
Scared? That was just my shadow

486
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,820
This is the success of our video!

487
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,780
- I have a fantastic idea!
- What is that?

488
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:06,460
Live Ghost Experience.
My new business plan!

489
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,020
Is it about Granny?

490
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:11,820
I'm going to stage and shoot
ghost videos and upload it on YouTube

491
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,340
- I don't understand
- Why should you understand?

492
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,180
Don't keep ragging her

493
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,820
In the current internet scenario...

494
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,900
...people want to watch
controversial content

495
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:24,460
Criticize a superb film and
call the collections fake...

496
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,700
...talk about atomic physics without
knowing ABC about it

497
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,980
Blame everything that happens
on Illuminati

498
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,340
What? Waste party?

499
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,420
Illuminati!

500
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,420
This generation needs attention

501
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,540
Impossible

502
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:38,820
When people start watching our video,
we become famous

503
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,660
And then, we will start making money

504
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:45,020
Isn't 'blue shirt' famous because he
criticized an epic like Baahubali?

505
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:47,140
True, he rips everyone off

506
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:48,900
Exactly!

507
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,380
Should I buy a blue shirt as well?

508
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:52,900
No?

509
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,780
So, how is my plan?

510
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,300
Plan's okay.

511
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,780
But you didn't
have to walk back and forth...

512
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:59,340
...to pitch your business.
My neck's strained!

513
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,780
Grandma? What do you say?

514
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,380
Okay, done!

515
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,860
Let's rock and roll!

516
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,740
I have to roll you around first!

517
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:17,060
Utter the chant 10,000 times!

518
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,460
Superb

519
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,580
Students, ready to narrate
your ghost story?

520
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,820
Next, rejected

521
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:24,620
Next

522
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,100
That's fake. Get out!

523
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,260
Have you seen the ghost?

524
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,180
My daughter died ten years ago

525
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,580
I buried her favourite doll
alongside her

526
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:34,980
One night, when my other daughter
was with her kid...

527
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:38,140
...she heard something
and looked under the bed

528
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:42,700
She saw the doll that was buried
with my daughter!

529
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,660
Is that really true?

530
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:47,620
Yes!

531
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:50,140
I swear, I know it's my daughter!

532
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,580
"Dream flutters..."

533
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,900
"...its wings towards us"

534
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:04,060
"It's our time to win!"

535
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:09,300
"Let the empty chest fill with money"

536
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:13,500
"The game's about to begin!"

537
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:18,700
"There's something there!
Can you hear it?"

538
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:23,260
"That just disappeared!
Did it wander off?"

539
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:28,100
"The insides shiver, eyes widen"

540
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:32,740
"The heart beats, body quakes"

541
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,740
Do you believe in ghosts?

542
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,780
Do you know what our
biggest blessing is?

543
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:38,820
Our mind!

544
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:41,740
Research what exists.
Create what doesn't!

545
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:43,300
No other animal is capable of this

546
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,780
This cognitive revolution
is a curse as well

547
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:49,700
Our minds have created and shaped
ghosts that don't really exist

548
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:52,580
In the end, we are stuck with
the repercussions of our imagination

549
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,140
That's the irony

550
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:57,620
All that I saw at home
is just an illusion?

551
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:00,660
Your videos might be fake.
But they are viral content

552
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,500
Keep it going.
Don't confuse yourself

553
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:04,340
Don't worry about anything

554
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,380
- Nice
- Yes

555
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,100
You're shooting real ghost?

556
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:09,060
Why doesn't the ghost
do anything to you?

557
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:11,180
Do we look like fools to you?

558
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:14,100
There's a ghost at home?
Give me your address

559
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:16,500
We want to meet the ghost too

560
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,860
We can't keep seeing them on video

2000 men come here to drink!

"There's something there!
Can you hear it?"

573
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:14,900
"That just disappeared,
did it wander off?"

- Mani?
- Yes?

578
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:47,420
- Wear this
- What is this?

579
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,100
Hearing aid, latest model

580
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:52,980
You bought this for me...
I'm proud of you!

581
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:55,940
I'm telling you there's a ghost here.
You don't believe me?

582
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:57,660
Let me show it to you on video!

583
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:00,740
Why did you come here?

584
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,620
Like I said, there's blood
all over the wall!

585
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:05,740
Do you guys believe me now?

586
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:08,060
Come, let's test this on grandma

00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:28,100
Ah! Valak is here!

590
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:33,420
Good job, grandma!

591
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:33,420

00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:34,660
Grandma!

Yamuna!

594
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:09,860
Grandma!

595
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:13,140
Grandma!

'Today'

597
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:59,300
We've got a call from the outskirts of
Nithilapuram, a person called Mani

598
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:02,100
- Where are you?
- We're nearby ma'am

599
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:05,460
- Please check and call for back up
- Okay

600
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:37,300
Dad!

601
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:45,140
Granny?

602
00:51:58,220 --> 00:51:59,500
Granny!

603
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:03,620
How are you baby girl?

604
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:08,820
Sorry!

605
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:13,460
Take me home

606
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:16,980
I don't like hospitals

607
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:21,540
Two more days.
We'll go home soon

608
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:25,740
To your house?

609
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:27,660
Your dad will be unhappy

610
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:29,540
I'm not coming there

611
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:38,900
He won't

612
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:41,980
He asked me to bring you home

613
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:59,420
- Sorry
- Watch your step

614
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:02,300
Sir?

615
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:04,700
Sir!

616
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:07,180
What's up?

617
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:09,100
You come here everyday

618
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:13,340
Buy a drink, sniff and leave

619
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:15,820
What is your story?

620
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:23,460
Do you know two people who steal
from vehicles to pay for drinks?

621
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:27,940
You mean Gothu and Shorty?

622
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:31,980
I know them, very well

623
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:51,660
Granny...

624
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:56,700
Granny...

625
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:06,700
Granny

626
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:13,740
Granny

627
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:40,860
Bhavani!

628
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:31,860
Your stupid ghost videos have led to
Granny's death!

629
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:37,340
You've made a grave mistake

630
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:41,540
Yamuna is a kid.

631
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:44,620
Granny and you
should've advised her against this

632
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:46,860
Do you know a life's worth?

633
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:48,700
It's okay, calm down

634
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:56,740
Mom's being buried right next
to my dad because of you guys...

635
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:07,820
What?

636
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:10,300
Bhavani is a very nice person

637
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:16,460
All of you killed her, didn't you?

638
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:20,980
Killed me too...

639
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:27,100
They're crying for your granny now

640
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:29,540
Tomorrow, it'll be for you!

641
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:46,580
What's going on?

642
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:53,300
Babloo!

643
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:54,220
Yamuna

644
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:55,140
Babloo!

645
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:56,220
What happened?

646
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:57,940
- Babloo!
- Who's Babloo?

647
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:00,180
What is it? Talk to us

648
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:01,140
Babloo!

649
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:02,980
Who's that?

650
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:04,460
Where's your nephew Babloo?

651
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:06,100
- My sister?
- Who?

652
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:08,220
I neither have a sister nor a nephew

653
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:09,260
Tell her

654
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:12,460
- Who's the dearest son Granny mentioned?
- That's my pet parrot

655
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,420
- Who are you talking about?
- Who is it?

656
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:16,220
He says there's no one

657
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:18,140
Aunty, it's my pet parrot

658
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:25,980
What happened to you?

659
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:28,900
- I'm very scared
- Please talk to us, we're here for you

660
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:50,300
No, let's leave this house immediately

661
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:54,140
- Let's go back to Chennai
- Perform a cleansing and lock the house

662
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:55,780
We're leaving

663
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:58,420
Mani, you should leave too

664
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:01,140
Go back to your native.
We'll meet later.

665
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:31,500
The lorry driver you threatened
yesterday is dead

666
01:03:32,740 --> 01:03:34,820
Mohit Agarwal - owner of a beer company

667
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:37,540
Drunk, he fell from the terrace
and died

668
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:41,340
Sir, Arivu fell off the terrace.
He's dead!

669
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:27,620
Name?

670
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:30,220
Bhavani

671
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:37,220
Repeat my actions

672
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:51,380
Close your eyes and
focus your mind

673
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:56,140
Fill your thoughts with Bhavani

674
01:05:06,860 --> 01:05:10,740
Her face, smile,
mannerism, behaviour...

675
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:12,980
Let it consume you!

676
01:05:16,060 --> 01:05:18,660
Channel your mind to take you to her

677
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:20,900
Bhavani

678
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:48,060
Bhavani

679
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:56,900
Bhavani

680
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:12,940
Why didn't you come see me
all these days?

681
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:16,100
Tell me you didn't kill any of them

682
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:17,300
I'll believe you

683
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:19,300
Just tell me once

684
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:21,580
It was me

685
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:27,220
You gave me all the happiness
that the world didn't

686
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:30,740
I will destroy everyone
who stole that from me!

687
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:32,660
Not right...

688
01:06:33,140 --> 01:06:38,300
Revenge is a success for mortals.
Why should you do that?

689
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:48,420
Bhavani!

690
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:51,100
It's not over yet

691
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:54,660
Not over?

692
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:59,580
- Who else?
- Don't come any closer

693
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:02,340
I don't want you to see me like this

694
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:03,400
I have something else to do

695
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:08,460
I will do it.
I will!

696
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:13,060
What are you planning to do?

697
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:15,740
Yamuna

698
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:13,860
- Yamuna, save us!
- Open the door

699
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:17,780
Mom! Dad!

700
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:19,340
Leave us

701
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:07,660
Why are you torturing me?

702
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:10,620
What did I do to you?

703
01:10:25,820 --> 01:10:27,860
What do you want?

704
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:30,900
It's one in the morning!

705
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:33,700
I need to find a girl called Yamuna

706
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:37,620
Fine, tell me

707
01:10:38,820 --> 01:10:40,100
Full name?

708
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:42,780
Place? Age?

709
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:46,980
I run an internet centre.
Not the cybercrime

710
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:49,180
What can I find with
just the first name?

711
01:10:59,740 --> 01:11:01,100
Play that video

712
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:02,420
This one?

713
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:05,100
Right

714
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:08,420
It's this girl!

715
01:11:18,580 --> 01:11:22,860
This girl is very famous.
She makes ghost videos

716
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:25,540
She's trending on YouTube

717
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:27,500
Check this out, freaky stuff

718
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:39,820
Bhavani is a very nice person

719
01:11:40,340 --> 01:11:43,540
All of you killed her

720
01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:51,780
'Lorry accident near Saidapet,
a girl and boy were killed'

721
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:05,940
You show it to them
They will give the death certificate

722
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:06,940
Okay, brother

723
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:09,180
Sir!

724
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:11,540
Ma'am

725
01:12:12,140 --> 01:12:16,460
Her husband received the body

726
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:18,500
Amudhan

727
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:20,380
'No, 163. 1st street Bhaskar colony
Vadapalani'

728
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:22,300
- Take this
- Thanks madam

729
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:25,860
- Did they collect the body?
- Yes

730
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:27,220
- When?
- Morning

731
01:13:52,980 --> 01:13:54,140
Aren't you Amudhan?

732
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:55,580
Please stop it

733
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:58,020
Ask your Bhavani to come out!
She's torturing me!

734
01:13:58,060 --> 01:14:00,300
I was looking for you to warn you

735
01:14:00,460 --> 01:14:02,140
You're not the first victim,
you're the ninth!

736
01:14:02,180 --> 01:14:04,220
Bhavani has killed eight people already

737
01:14:04,820 --> 01:14:06,980
Including three from her own family

738
01:14:21,940 --> 01:14:25,180
Do you know Bhavani?

739
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:30,500
You've harmed her in some way

740
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:33,220
What nonsense?

741
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:38,020
I've never met her before.
I have no idea how she looks!

742
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:39,940
Why should I harm her?

743
01:14:40,580 --> 01:14:43,660
It might not have been intentional

744
01:14:43,740 --> 01:14:44,900
Think about it

745
01:14:57,700 --> 01:14:59,780
Mohit Agarwal - business man

746
01:15:01,140 --> 01:15:03,020
Arivu - Head constable

747
01:15:03,180 --> 01:15:04,740
Francis - Lorry driver

748
01:15:04,940 --> 01:15:06,140
Gothu, shorty

749
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:08,780
They have nothing in common

750
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:13,580
She has also killed her mom,
sister and brother-in-law

751
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:21,420
I know why she killed her family

752
01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:26,140
Initially, I couldn't believe that
Bhavani did all this

753
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:30,020
I have never seen her raise
so much as her voice

754
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:36,620
The world crushed a feather like her
under its cruel feet!

755
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:47,500
Whenever a life is born,
people should celebrate

756
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:49,180
Which baby she begot?

757
01:15:49,220 --> 01:15:53,220
But my Bhavani was born with a curse

758
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:55,300
It's a girl again

759
01:15:55,340 --> 01:15:59,260
- Girl again!
- What can you do?

760
01:15:59,540 --> 01:16:03,180
- Don't fret
- He really wanted a son!

761
01:16:03,260 --> 01:16:04,980
He's going to suffer with three girls

762
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:06,620
God needs to show him a way

763
01:16:07,820 --> 01:16:09,340
Marimuthu!

764
01:16:09,620 --> 01:16:10,660
Mari...

765
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:16,300
They branded her unlucky
for no mistake of hers

766
01:16:17,180 --> 01:16:19,140
Mari died by a lightning strike!

767
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:29,420
Dear, don't get up

768
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:32,820
No...don't

769
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:39,780
Her own mother hated her,
discarded her!

770
01:16:40,820 --> 01:16:46,260
She didn't know that the hatred
would travel with her, all her life

771
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:55,660
The baby's crying, can you hold her?

772
01:16:55,940 --> 01:16:57,260
Baby...

773
01:16:57,980 --> 01:17:00,500
My husband died because of her

774
01:17:01,060 --> 01:17:03,780
Throw that scum away.
Let her rot and die

775
01:17:17,060 --> 01:17:21,020
School days are
the most glorious ones

776
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:23,820
It was the same for Bhavani

777
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:26,660
Good shot

778
01:17:27,780 --> 01:17:31,900
- Look at her face
- Blackie, how's that?

779
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:33,140
Is that enough?

780
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:34,860
Look at that beauty!

781
01:17:35,140 --> 01:17:38,140
It's the last day of school and
you're not a woman yet!

782
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:40,020
When is that likely to happen?

783
01:17:40,140 --> 01:17:42,300
We'll put up a hoarding
if that happens. Okay?

784
01:17:42,380 --> 01:17:46,300
Are you even sure you're a girl?

785
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:48,420
Good question

786
01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:50,900
A guy's touch can transform you

787
01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:53,380
Her own friends ragged her

788
01:17:53,540 --> 01:17:55,060
Everytime she wept...

789
01:17:55,940 --> 01:17:59,740
I felt ashamed that
I couldn't help her

790
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:03,940
That anger, transformed into love

791
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:10,860
Bhavani, hold on

792
01:18:11,380 --> 01:18:12,500
Bhavani

793
01:18:14,780 --> 01:18:16,260
Please stop crying

794
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:18,380
Don't mind them

795
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:20,300
You'll hit puberty when
your body is ready

796
01:18:20,340 --> 01:18:22,380
Didn't we learn this in Biology?

797
01:18:23,180 --> 01:18:25,620
Listen to me, please don't cry

798
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:41,980
I like you a lot!

799
01:18:49,740 --> 01:18:51,980
The family that did not
celebrate her birth...

800
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:55,420
...celebrated her puberty like it's
an achievement of hers!

801
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:03,140
Keep quite

802
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:15,620
Oh God!

803
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:55,180
I'm seeing you like this
for the first time

804
01:19:57,380 --> 01:19:59,180
You look beautiful!
Do you know that?

805
01:20:01,460 --> 01:20:03,660
I've got you something

806
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:06,660
Gift

807
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:14,500
Please open it

808
01:20:21,580 --> 01:20:23,140
I got it from town

809
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:25,460
Do you like it?

810
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:31,780
The red one will look
very pretty on you

811
01:20:43,740 --> 01:20:47,300
The red one looks very pretty on you!

812
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:50,940
Unlucky girl, born at the wrong time!
Bled at the wrong time!

813
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:53,580
Were you born to destroy our lives?

814
01:20:53,620 --> 01:20:56,020
Get out! I don't want to see your face

815
01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:07,580
Sister's baby is mentally challenged

816
01:21:08,180 --> 01:21:12,660
Everyone thinks it's your luck
that brought it

817
01:21:12,980 --> 01:21:17,140
Whatever went wrong in her family,
it was blamed on her

818
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:22,620
Everytime she cried,
I was there to wipe her tears

819
01:21:23,900 --> 01:21:25,940
Her smile was the light in my life

820
01:21:26,020 --> 01:21:27,700
I was the light in hers

821
01:21:44,740 --> 01:21:47,860
Hold me, Amudha!

822
01:21:49,420 --> 01:21:50,420
What?

823
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:04,140
You're the best thing
that happened in my life!

824
01:22:08,180 --> 01:22:09,340
What's this?

825
01:22:09,660 --> 01:22:14,180
No jealous looks should harm you.
That's why...

826
01:22:16,380 --> 01:22:17,620
Bhavani...

827
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:21,340
I'm going to join college in Coimbatore

828
01:22:21,620 --> 01:22:23,020
Come with me.

829
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:24,500
We'll study together

830
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:27,140
Will you?

831
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:32,260
It's a surprise they allowed me
to complete schooling

832
01:22:34,340 --> 01:22:35,540
Let's do something

833
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:39,340
I'll study, get into a good job...

834
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:43,380
...earn money and then help you study.
Okay?

835
01:22:44,380 --> 01:22:47,900
I just want you by my side
all my life

836
01:22:48,620 --> 01:22:50,020
I need nothing more

837
01:22:57,940 --> 01:22:59,180
What?

838
01:23:06,980 --> 01:23:09,100
I'll hit you, you dog!

839
01:23:10,460 --> 01:23:12,220
Hot for a man at this age

840
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:15,460
The whole village knows you're unlucky

841
01:23:15,540 --> 01:23:19,260
You'll find someone like you.
What's your hurry?

842
01:23:20,260 --> 01:23:24,300
Let's leave, you think you're a Romeo?
Did you look at her face!

843
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:26,580
Gave birth to a scum

844
01:23:27,860 --> 01:23:32,460
You're born to embarrass me.
I wish you were dead!

845
01:23:50,140 --> 01:23:55,100
I left her like a coward,
scared of my father

846
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:06,500
Amudhan!

847
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:12,860
I met Bhavani after a long time,
by chance

848
01:24:14,220 --> 01:24:17,420
I still don't understand
why she's after you

849
01:24:18,980 --> 01:24:21,940
To decipher that, I think
you should meet someone I know

850
01:24:32,460 --> 01:24:35,700
Call me if you need anything.
I'll help you

851
01:24:35,780 --> 01:24:36,980
Go

852
01:24:48,180 --> 01:24:51,300
You're not the first victim,
you're the ninth!

853
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:52,580
She's killed eight people so far

854
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:54,940
I still don't understand
why she's after you

855
01:24:54,980 --> 01:24:57,100
I think you need to talk to Bhavani

856
01:24:57,140 --> 01:24:59,540
You've harmed her in some way!

857
01:24:59,620 --> 01:25:01,340
You should meet someone I know

858
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:20,820
Yamuna

859
01:25:21,380 --> 01:25:22,860
Where were you?

860
01:25:23,260 --> 01:25:26,580
You dropped just a message.
We've been worked up

861
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:39,260
We know you've been
upset over granny's death

862
01:25:39,540 --> 01:25:42,380
Do you want to go on a vacation.
Go...

863
01:25:43,220 --> 01:25:46,940
Or do you want therapy?
We'll arrange for it

864
01:25:47,380 --> 01:25:49,860
Please don't stop
communicating with us

865
01:25:50,180 --> 01:25:52,380
You're all we have

866
01:25:52,660 --> 01:25:53,900
Please talk to us

867
01:25:56,380 --> 01:25:58,740
I've been called for
an interview in Delhi

868
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:01,580
National news channel.
I have to leave today

869
01:26:02,020 --> 01:26:05,500
At this time?
Don't say yes to all her demands

870
01:26:05,860 --> 01:26:07,220
Go for it

871
01:26:07,540 --> 01:26:09,220
Whatever you what want to do

872
01:26:09,260 --> 01:26:10,700
But take care

873
01:26:11,620 --> 01:26:13,980
Thank you dad, mom

874
01:28:52,580 --> 01:28:55,540
(RITUALISTIC CHANTING)

875
01:29:05,580 --> 01:29:07,860
Amudhan, it's time

876
01:31:50,900 --> 01:31:52,420
What do you want?

877
01:31:58,220 --> 01:32:00,700
I know your childhood was harsh

878
01:32:01,140 --> 01:32:05,740
Everybody wants happiness in life.
But not everyone gets it

879
01:32:07,220 --> 01:32:09,820
Everybody aspires to live happily

880
01:32:10,060 --> 01:32:13,220
But when happiness eludes you
all your life...

881
01:32:13,620 --> 01:32:15,380
...life in itself becomes an aspiration

882
01:32:34,700 --> 01:32:38,380
The girl seems short.
Our son is very tall!

883
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:48,180
How much dowry can we expect?

884
01:32:49,140 --> 01:32:52,340
- We can manage five sovereigns of gold
- Just five?

885
01:32:52,660 --> 01:32:55,180
You said they could manage 25?

886
01:33:03,620 --> 01:33:07,260
She's dark, we expected a fairer bride

887
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:12,460
Heard many families checked her out

888
01:33:12,540 --> 01:33:14,980
Any defect in her body?
Be honest!

889
01:33:17,460 --> 01:33:19,500
We heard she's unlucky

890
01:33:19,780 --> 01:33:21,060
Is that true?

891
01:33:26,060 --> 01:33:27,620
We don't like her

892
01:33:36,780 --> 01:33:40,260
They've been hunting for eight years.
No groom likes you

893
01:33:40,820 --> 01:33:42,460
Is marriage ever possible for you?

894
01:33:42,540 --> 01:33:43,940
Wait and watch...

895
01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:47,140
...you'll still be a spinster
at 60 years of age

896
01:33:47,220 --> 01:33:49,300
Living alone in this house!

897
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:56,740
Look at that face!

898
01:34:42,380 --> 01:34:45,940
Stop wailing like a kid.
Tell us what happened!

899
01:34:46,020 --> 01:34:48,580
What's up with you?
Why are you crying?

900
01:34:49,140 --> 01:34:51,300
Answer your sister

901
01:34:54,420 --> 01:34:56,700
Brother- in- law tried to...

902
01:34:56,740 --> 01:34:58,420
What? Me?

903
01:34:58,860 --> 01:35:00,980
Fine, don't make it a scene

904
01:35:01,300 --> 01:35:05,580
She's 32 and still a virgin.
Pity her, what will she do?

905
01:35:05,620 --> 01:35:07,620
She'll want a man's touch too

906
01:35:07,820 --> 01:35:09,740
- Mom, no
- You slut!

907
01:35:10,340 --> 01:35:13,540
- I didn't do anything
- What is wrong with you?

908
01:35:13,860 --> 01:35:17,260
You spoiled everybody's life
and now come for mine.

909
01:35:17,340 --> 01:35:19,580
Get out of the house!

910
01:35:19,700 --> 01:35:23,820
You're falsely accusing her husband.
How wretched of you!

911
01:35:23,860 --> 01:35:26,420
We shouldn't have
let you live in our house!

912
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:28,620
Get out of the house!

913
01:35:28,660 --> 01:35:30,620
Ask mom not to hit aunt

914
01:35:30,700 --> 01:35:31,580
Dad

915
01:35:31,620 --> 01:35:36,180
You're trying to share my husband!
How dare you!

916
01:35:36,460 --> 01:35:37,980
Get out, get out!

917
01:35:38,060 --> 01:35:40,620
Go die somewhere!
Don't come back

918
01:35:40,820 --> 01:35:42,260
We should have killed you
when you born

919
01:35:42,300 --> 01:35:45,980
Sister! Mom!

920
01:35:46,980 --> 01:35:48,740
Sister!

921
01:35:52,060 --> 01:35:54,980
Sister! Where will I go?

922
01:35:56,540 --> 01:35:58,700
I'm scared, mom!

923
01:36:03,140 --> 01:36:04,420
Sister!

924
01:36:08,060 --> 01:36:13,580
I came to Chennai thereafter,
roamed the streets for two years

925
01:36:14,220 --> 01:36:16,260
I got employed in a hotel
as a janitor

926
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:21,980
We have been forgetting
our mother tongue in Tamilnadu

927
01:36:22,100 --> 01:36:25,860
In Canada, we still
teach our kids Tamil

928
01:36:26,300 --> 01:36:29,620
We offering you 20,000 dollar
salary minimum

929
01:36:29,860 --> 01:36:32,100
And a good stay in out of the city

930
01:36:32,140 --> 01:36:35,260
How does that sound, Amudhan?

931
01:36:36,300 --> 01:36:37,580
Ask what you want

932
01:36:37,620 --> 01:36:38,580
Sir!

933
01:36:40,140 --> 01:36:43,500
It's not for the money.
I want to do what I love

934
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:50,700
Students want to learn Tamil from you
after reading your books

935
01:36:55,060 --> 01:36:57,700
When are you bringing your family
back to India?

936
01:36:58,540 --> 01:37:01,860
We'll come.
When are you planning to get married?

937
01:37:01,900 --> 01:37:04,420
When are you bringing
your wife to Canada?

938
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:09,540
Sorry!

939
01:37:09,980 --> 01:37:11,140
Sorry, sir

940
01:37:11,180 --> 01:37:12,340
Extremely sorry

941
01:37:12,380 --> 01:37:13,860
It was my fault

942
01:37:13,940 --> 01:37:16,100
- Go inside!
- Sorry, sir

943
01:37:16,740 --> 01:37:18,740
- Our sincere apologies
- No, it was my fault

944
01:37:18,780 --> 01:37:21,620
I moved when she was trying to clean.
It's okay

945
01:37:59,380 --> 01:38:01,660
Why are you crying?

946
01:38:06,180 --> 01:38:07,540
It was my mistake

947
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:10,340
I'll talk to your supervisor, come

948
01:38:11,100 --> 01:38:12,260
Please come

949
01:38:14,220 --> 01:38:15,420
Amudha!

950
01:38:29,660 --> 01:38:30,900
Bhavani...

951
01:39:12,460 --> 01:39:13,620
Come in

952
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:42,420
Where were you all these days?

953
01:39:44,940 --> 01:39:46,140
Are you married?

954
01:39:53,820 --> 01:39:55,380
Where did you go?

955
01:39:56,620 --> 01:40:00,180
You left me for your father's word

956
01:40:15,660 --> 01:40:19,020
I got a call from the Army
when I was in college

957
01:40:19,100 --> 01:40:22,020
I've seen a lot of blood,
tears and death

958
01:40:22,300 --> 01:40:25,260
I took voluntary retirement
and came looking for you

959
01:40:25,580 --> 01:40:29,300
Whatever happened in my life
was leading me towards you

960
01:40:29,980 --> 01:40:31,340
I realize that now

961
01:40:36,420 --> 01:40:38,740
What were you doing in my hotel?

962
01:40:42,820 --> 01:40:44,540
I was a writer while in the army

963
01:40:44,620 --> 01:40:49,020
I've been offered a job in Canada
to teach Tamil

964
01:40:49,060 --> 01:40:50,500
I came to meet them

965
01:40:53,380 --> 01:40:56,140
You're going to Canada?

966
01:40:57,060 --> 01:40:59,940
We're getting old, let me
ask you directly

967
01:41:00,060 --> 01:41:02,180
Come with me.
Let's go to Canada

968
01:41:02,260 --> 01:41:03,860
Let's have a fresh start

969
01:41:03,900 --> 01:41:05,860
We'll teach kids Tamil

970
01:41:05,900 --> 01:41:07,940
We'll have kids.
Two daughters...

971
01:41:08,020 --> 01:41:11,780
Dusky, dark, beautiful
just like you!

972
01:41:14,460 --> 01:41:16,420
We'll have a beautiful life...

973
01:41:16,460 --> 01:41:20,060
...and at 70, die in each other's arms
shivering in Canadian snow

974
01:41:22,700 --> 01:41:24,500
But before that...

975
01:41:25,180 --> 01:41:26,620
...can we get married?

976
01:41:34,260 --> 01:41:36,340
You're planting dreams in me now

977
01:41:37,300 --> 01:41:41,340
And then when you find that
I'm ugly or unlucky...

978
01:41:41,860 --> 01:41:43,700
...will you leave me?

979
01:41:48,420 --> 01:41:50,420
I've been crushed...

980
01:41:54,260 --> 01:41:56,740
Don't stamp me further, please?

981
01:42:01,220 --> 01:42:02,740
You're beautiful

982
01:42:03,060 --> 01:42:04,420
Very beautiful!

983
01:42:04,620 --> 01:42:09,660
Despite your luck, date of birth,
father's death...

984
01:42:10,940 --> 01:42:12,420
...you're beautiful!

985
01:42:12,540 --> 01:42:15,220
Listen to me, listen to your Amudhan!

986
01:42:15,420 --> 01:42:18,380
No one could see your purity

987
01:42:18,460 --> 01:42:21,140
I see it, only I can see it!

988
01:42:24,260 --> 01:42:25,540
Marry me

989
01:42:34,220 --> 01:42:39,620
"Messenger clouds..."

990
01:42:40,380 --> 01:42:43,580
"Sing my song of love..."

991
01:42:45,100 --> 01:42:51,220
"Will the maiden's dream
forever remain a mirage?"

992
01:42:51,260 --> 01:42:57,380
"Will the summer moon
quench her longing?"

993
01:42:57,460 --> 01:43:00,660
"A distant sliver of light sneaks in"

994
01:43:00,700 --> 01:43:03,700
"As the lonely flower fades in darkness "

995
01:43:03,740 --> 01:43:06,700
"Is this just a dream..."

996
01:43:06,780 --> 01:43:13,740
"...a fear grips the heart
as each day dawns"

997
01:43:16,020 --> 01:43:19,140
"Messenger clouds! Sing my song"

998
01:43:19,220 --> 01:43:22,260
"And kiss me tender as gentle rain "

999
01:43:22,300 --> 01:43:25,340
"As the epic poet rejoices
 in our tale of love"

1000
01:43:25,420 --> 01:43:28,740
"Rainbows come waltzing back
into my life"

1001
01:43:30,060 --> 01:43:34,580
"Messenger clouds..."

1002
01:43:36,260 --> 01:43:38,620
"Sing my song of love..."

1003
01:44:05,620 --> 01:44:11,820
"You and I, Time's absurd play
 Tossed astray, into the winds"

1004
01:44:11,900 --> 01:44:17,980
"Those winds now bind us
A saga, for the world to see"

1005
01:44:18,060 --> 01:44:21,180
"Divine jasmine buds, adorning the Lord"

1006
01:44:21,260 --> 01:44:24,260
"Have found their way to my own yard"

1007
01:44:24,340 --> 01:44:26,940
"Forget me not, forever more "

1008
01:44:26,980 --> 01:44:31,020
"Forsake me not, come calm or storm"

1009
01:44:36,220 --> 01:44:39,780
You love black, don't you?
Here you go.

1010
01:44:42,980 --> 01:44:44,540
"Messenger clouds..."

1011
01:44:44,620 --> 01:44:46,140
"Sing my song of love..."

1012
01:44:46,180 --> 01:44:49,180
"And kiss me tender as gentle rain "

1013
01:44:49,260 --> 01:44:52,300
"As the epic poet rejoices
 in our tale of love"

1014
01:44:52,380 --> 01:44:55,540
"Rainbows come waltzing back
into my life"

1015
01:45:14,060 --> 01:45:15,660
- Bhavani
- Yes?

1016
01:45:15,980 --> 01:45:18,740
Please make it to our wedding

1017
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:31,660
"Delicate white blossoms, pure and true
That's the beauty I see in you "

1018
01:45:31,700 --> 01:45:37,820
"Your hand in mine, forever entwined
That's the day I long for, my love"

1019
01:45:37,900 --> 01:45:40,980
"These words from you,
I've longed to hear"

1020
01:45:41,020 --> 01:45:44,060
"And to my eyes, they bring a tear"

1021
01:45:44,140 --> 01:45:46,780
"Is it but the maiden's tears..."

1022
01:45:46,820 --> 01:45:50,860
"...coming down as dark thunderclouds?"

1023
01:45:57,980 --> 01:46:04,060
"Will the maiden's dream
forever remain a mirage?"

1024
01:46:04,140 --> 01:46:10,180
"Will the summer moon
quench her longing?"

1025
01:46:10,260 --> 01:46:13,460
"A distant sliver of light sneaks in"

1026
01:46:13,540 --> 01:46:16,500
"As the lonely flower fades in darkness"

1027
01:46:16,580 --> 01:46:19,620
"Is this just a dream..."

1028
01:46:19,700 --> 01:46:25,780
"...a fear grips the heart
as each day dawns"

1029
01:46:35,060 --> 01:46:37,020
What's the occasion?

1030
01:46:38,260 --> 01:46:39,740
Who's getting married?

1031
01:46:40,060 --> 01:46:42,020
Who else?
Should be hers...

1032
01:47:03,980 --> 01:47:05,380
My future wife...

1033
01:47:05,540 --> 01:47:07,820
My beauty...
Have you left from work?

1034
01:47:07,860 --> 01:47:09,260
About to

1035
01:47:09,900 --> 01:47:12,500
Why don't you keep talking to me
till you reach?

1036
01:47:12,540 --> 01:47:16,700
- Sure, why not?
- Take an auto, don't come by bus

1037
01:47:20,020 --> 01:47:21,100
Bhavani!

1038
01:47:21,140 --> 01:47:25,180
Remember I told you about room no. 701,
the beer company owner?

1039
01:47:25,220 --> 01:47:26,860
He's calling me to clean the room

1040
01:47:26,980 --> 01:47:29,340
Isn't your shift over?
Just leave...

1041
01:47:29,380 --> 01:47:32,700
- Give me five minutes, let me check
- Fine, come back soon

1042
01:47:40,220 --> 01:47:43,900
You're dressed like a mannequin

1043
01:47:43,940 --> 01:47:45,540
Where are you going?

1044
01:47:46,260 --> 01:47:49,260
Why don't you spend
one night with me?

1045
01:47:51,300 --> 01:47:54,300
Tell me your price, I'll pay you

1046
01:47:57,900 --> 01:48:01,060
You have to be back here tomorrow.
Remember that!

1047
01:48:01,580 --> 01:48:03,300
Is the auto available?

1048
01:48:04,700 --> 01:48:07,140
- Where to?
- Registrar's office, Saidapet

1049
01:48:07,220 --> 01:48:08,740
I'm heading there, tell me?

1050
01:48:08,780 --> 01:48:12,740
After our wedding, vacate your hostel
and come home with me

1051
01:48:12,780 --> 01:48:15,140
Everything will be ready for you

1052
01:48:15,780 --> 01:48:20,340
Do you remember you gave me a gift
when we were in school?

1053
01:48:20,740 --> 01:48:23,980
I have a gift for you too.

1054
01:48:29,180 --> 01:48:32,060
You're my biggest gift.
Do I need more?

1055
01:48:33,260 --> 01:48:34,860
Stop teasing me

1056
01:48:36,060 --> 01:48:39,660
What's the gift, my dearest princess?

1057
01:48:40,060 --> 01:48:41,460
That's a surprise

1058
01:48:45,540 --> 01:48:47,900
Hey! Get out of the auto!

1059
01:48:47,980 --> 01:48:49,540
What do you guys want?
Move!

1060
01:48:49,620 --> 01:48:52,180
- Get down!
- Who do you think you are?

1061
01:48:52,420 --> 01:48:53,500
Hello!

1062
01:48:54,100 --> 01:48:55,180
Bhavani!

1063
01:48:55,260 --> 01:49:01,780
Two drunkards are threatening us
for money in Vandikaran street

1064
01:49:01,820 --> 01:49:05,220
- Is anyone there with you?
- Hold on for a minute

1065
01:49:05,260 --> 01:49:06,300
Hello!

1066
01:49:07,980 --> 01:49:11,980
- Every single person pays us here!
- Brother, I'll pay you

1067
01:49:12,420 --> 01:49:14,060
What's happening there!

1068
01:49:14,540 --> 01:49:15,740
Don't give it

1069
01:49:15,780 --> 01:49:18,060
- You get into the auto, dear
- Stay out of this

1070
01:49:18,100 --> 01:49:19,780
Give the bag

1071
01:49:19,820 --> 01:49:22,380
Please return my bag

1072
01:49:22,420 --> 01:49:25,260
Brother, not that please.
That's my wedding ring

1073
01:49:25,340 --> 01:49:26,940
Brother, don't take it

1074
01:49:27,020 --> 01:49:28,020
A platinum ring!

1075
01:49:28,060 --> 01:49:29,540
I'll give you anything else you want

1076
01:49:29,580 --> 01:49:31,380
We got a ring instead of money

1077
01:49:31,740 --> 01:49:32,700
Brother!

1078
01:49:32,740 --> 01:49:35,740
We aimed for cheap beer
but we've got imported champagne!

1079
01:49:35,780 --> 01:49:39,020
I bought that for my wedding.
Anything but that, please...

1080
01:49:39,060 --> 01:49:41,340
- I'm begging you, please
- Take your bag

1081
01:49:41,460 --> 01:49:44,540
Who's marrying your ugly face?

1082
01:49:45,020 --> 01:49:46,660
Why did you take your bag out?

1083
01:49:46,700 --> 01:49:47,820
They are doing like this...

1084
01:49:47,860 --> 01:49:50,140
Are you there?

1085
01:49:51,020 --> 01:49:53,980
The drunkards stole your gift from me

1086
01:49:56,580 --> 01:49:57,860
It's alright

1087
01:49:58,620 --> 01:49:59,860
It's just a gift...

1088
01:50:01,020 --> 01:50:02,620
...we can buy it anytime

1089
01:50:03,580 --> 01:50:05,500
Stop crying.
Wipe your tears.

1090
01:50:08,940 --> 01:50:10,220
Where are you now?

1091
01:50:11,540 --> 01:50:15,860
- I'm almost there, I'll call you back
- Okay, be careful

1092
01:50:29,220 --> 01:50:31,180
You thief!
Trying to flee with the jewels?

1093
01:50:31,220 --> 01:50:32,180
- Come with me!
- It's not me

1094
01:50:32,220 --> 01:50:33,820
Do I look like an idiot?

1095
01:50:33,860 --> 01:50:36,180
- She ran away...
- You're refusing to come?

1096
01:50:45,260 --> 01:50:47,140
- Where's the bride?
- She'll be here in five

1097
01:50:47,180 --> 01:50:48,660
Ma'am, are we next?

1098
01:50:48,700 --> 01:50:52,340
- My husband is waiting for me
- Shut your mouth!

1099
01:50:52,420 --> 01:50:54,660
You're getting married?
Should I believe that!

1100
01:50:54,700 --> 01:50:58,820
I'll book you for prostitution
along with robbery. Mind it!

1101
01:50:58,900 --> 01:51:00,980
- Shut it!
- I didn't do anything wrong

1102
01:51:01,020 --> 01:51:04,220
They've caught the thief.
It's not this girl

1103
01:51:04,900 --> 01:51:08,460
- They've caught her?
- I told you it's not me

1104
01:51:09,180 --> 01:51:11,140
I'm sure you'll get caught again

1105
01:51:11,780 --> 01:51:12,940
Get lost

1106
01:51:20,020 --> 01:51:21,700
- Excuse me
- Sure

1107
01:51:22,100 --> 01:51:23,420
Tell me

1108
01:51:23,700 --> 01:51:27,340
Amudha, a policeman caught me.
They hit me

1109
01:51:27,380 --> 01:51:30,020
- They hit you? Who was it?
- I did nothing wrong

1110
01:51:30,060 --> 01:51:31,660
What happened? Tell me!

1111
01:51:31,780 --> 01:51:34,380
I wonder why I'm always cornered

1112
01:51:34,620 --> 01:51:36,340
Where are you? I'll be there

1113
01:51:36,420 --> 01:51:41,180
- No, I'm close by. I'll be right there
- Alright, I'll wait here

1114
01:51:44,900 --> 01:51:46,380
Sister, hold on

1115
01:51:47,900 --> 01:51:50,700
Can you help me cross the road?

1116
01:52:00,100 --> 01:52:02,900
It's only been mental torture
since I married you!

1117
01:52:02,940 --> 01:52:04,740
Pain in the ass

1118
01:52:15,900 --> 01:52:17,820
Hey, call the ambulance

1119
01:52:51,620 --> 01:52:56,140
The day I was to marry Amudhan
and start a new life...

1120
01:52:56,540 --> 01:53:00,580
...ended in my funeral!
That's because of...

1121
01:53:00,660 --> 01:53:04,980
...the selfishness,
the lack of empathy...

1122
01:53:05,020 --> 01:53:08,260
...avarice, greed, lust...

1123
01:53:08,300 --> 01:53:10,820
...hatred towards others
who are unlike us!

1124
01:53:17,900 --> 01:53:19,980
That little mistake of yours...

1125
01:53:20,500 --> 01:53:22,820
...a mistake you did
out of selfishness...

1126
01:53:22,860 --> 01:53:25,340
...has destroyed my life, Yamuna!

1127
01:53:56,180 --> 01:53:57,300
Madam!

1128
01:53:58,380 --> 01:53:59,780
Please hold the lift

1129
01:54:23,260 --> 01:54:25,020
I wonder why I'm always cornered

1130
01:54:46,060 --> 01:54:49,740
What do you want?
What do you want me to do?

1131
01:54:50,100 --> 01:54:51,780
It's you, that I want!

1132
01:54:51,980 --> 01:54:54,820
I want to re-live my life through you!

1133
01:54:59,780 --> 01:55:02,780
I didn't have a good life
when I was alive...

1134
01:55:03,100 --> 01:55:04,380
...I want it now!

1135
01:55:04,700 --> 01:55:07,260
You have to sacrifice yourself
for that!

1136
01:55:09,060 --> 01:55:11,980
If that was your aim,
you could have taken me before

1137
01:55:12,380 --> 01:55:16,540
I could have. But I wanted
your wholehearted consent

1138
01:55:18,380 --> 01:55:19,900
Then, why did you torment me?

1139
01:55:19,940 --> 01:55:22,540
Shouldn't you experience
a little bit of...

1140
01:55:22,580 --> 01:55:26,460
...the suffering that I went through?

1141
01:55:27,420 --> 01:55:28,780
You should know!

1142
01:55:28,820 --> 01:55:32,180
You will understand my pain
only then!

1143
01:55:33,380 --> 01:55:36,540
You'll know my demand
is not unfair!

1144
01:56:01,620 --> 01:56:03,780
Hello. yes

1145
01:56:04,620 --> 01:56:06,860
Amudhan, no...

1146
01:56:07,820 --> 01:56:08,980
Stop it

1147
01:58:33,460 --> 01:58:36,260
What's all this?
Flowers, decoration.

1148
01:58:44,460 --> 01:58:46,740
Your Bhavani is coming back to you

1149
01:58:47,700 --> 01:58:48,900
Through me

1150
01:59:00,980 --> 01:59:03,620
This is wrong.
You can't change fate

1151
01:59:04,940 --> 01:59:08,380
If I can change her fate,
why shouldn't I?

1152
01:59:14,660 --> 01:59:16,020
What a life...

1153
01:59:16,420 --> 01:59:18,780
...one man gets it all...

1154
01:59:19,980 --> 01:59:23,540
...the other gets none at all!

1155
01:59:24,380 --> 01:59:27,660
Why is God not aware of this?

1156
01:59:27,940 --> 01:59:29,380
He created us all

1157
01:59:29,900 --> 01:59:30,860
And then?

1158
01:59:30,940 --> 01:59:32,140
Did he doze off?

1159
01:59:40,940 --> 01:59:45,940
What God couldn't give her,
I have a chance to give

1160
02:00:14,660 --> 02:00:18,060
What started with me,
shall end with me

1161
02:01:03,980 --> 02:01:05,140
Bhavani...

1162
02:01:06,860 --> 02:01:08,820
Please make it to our wedding

1163
02:01:24,180 --> 02:01:25,700
Didn't I tell you...

1164
02:01:29,100 --> 02:01:31,260
...that I'll come back for you!

1165
02:01:35,220 --> 02:01:38,940
I'm finally getting to live my dream

1166
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:43,780
I wanted the whole world
to see us wed

1167
02:01:44,220 --> 02:01:45,340
But, that's alright

1168
02:01:45,380 --> 02:01:49,500
Let's have a beautiful wedding
with just you and me

1169
02:02:03,140 --> 02:02:06,580
But, something's missing.

1170
02:02:20,020 --> 02:02:21,220
Here you go

1171
02:02:23,300 --> 02:02:26,100
The whole world is envious
of my Amudhan

1172
02:02:35,660 --> 02:02:37,220
It's time...

1173
02:02:38,580 --> 02:02:40,060
Let's get married!

1174
02:03:05,340 --> 02:03:06,740
This is wrong

1175
02:03:09,180 --> 02:03:09,940
What is?

1176
02:03:09,980 --> 02:03:14,540
Destroying a girl's life
to start our own.

1177
02:03:14,580 --> 02:03:15,820
This is wrong!

1178
02:03:25,140 --> 02:03:26,300
Wait

1179
02:03:26,500 --> 02:03:28,900
Don't walk away when we see
some light in our life

1180
02:03:28,940 --> 02:03:30,700
I did all this for you

1181
02:03:31,380 --> 02:03:32,900
I didn't ask you to

1182
02:03:40,020 --> 02:03:41,060
Stop!

1183
02:03:41,820 --> 02:03:45,220
What are you doing?
She agreed to this

1184
02:03:45,540 --> 02:03:46,860
Come with me

1185
02:03:47,580 --> 02:03:48,700
Leave me

1186
02:04:01,340 --> 02:04:03,900
When we were in school...

1187
02:04:05,740 --> 02:04:07,980
...I used to admire you
through the window

1188
02:04:10,060 --> 02:04:11,700
That's the beauty I want

1189
02:04:15,260 --> 02:04:18,100
She would intend harm to no one

1190
02:04:20,900 --> 02:04:22,660
I don't want this Bhavani

1191
02:04:28,180 --> 02:04:30,780
Yamuna's got it all

1192
02:04:30,820 --> 02:04:34,660
Parents, family, happiness,
education, everything!

1193
02:04:35,420 --> 02:04:37,980
I asked for her body.
What's wrong with that?

1194
02:04:38,500 --> 02:04:41,740
Who are you to decide
what's right and what's wrong?

1195
02:04:43,020 --> 02:04:47,420
Six strangers have rewritten my fate

1196
02:04:48,380 --> 02:04:49,660
Isn't that wrong?

1197
02:04:50,140 --> 02:04:51,820
She is one among them!

1198
02:04:52,380 --> 02:04:53,780
No matter what...

1199
02:04:55,100 --> 02:04:56,420
...I can't do this

1200
02:04:56,780 --> 02:04:58,460
When I look at you...

1201
02:04:59,780 --> 02:05:01,860
...I don't see my old Bhavani in you

1202
02:05:02,380 --> 02:05:05,700
I can see Yamuna lurking underneath

1203
02:05:08,740 --> 02:05:13,940
I can't justify this, accept it
and lead a life with you

1204
02:05:21,700 --> 02:05:23,660
You still won't agree?

1205
02:05:24,060 --> 02:05:27,660
Fine, she doesn't deserve the life
that we can't get!

1206
02:05:29,420 --> 02:05:31,900
No, leave her

1207
02:05:31,980 --> 02:05:33,300
She's innocent!

1208
02:05:36,740 --> 02:05:38,140
Am I not?

1209
02:05:43,940 --> 02:05:46,980
If you don't agree,
she dies right now!

1210
02:05:49,260 --> 02:05:51,380
This is not about her life

1211
02:05:51,860 --> 02:05:56,180
I loved you and I dreamt of
a life with you

1212
02:05:57,660 --> 02:06:00,420
Now here you are,
in someone else's body!

1213
02:06:00,540 --> 02:06:02,740
How can I accept that?

1214
02:06:06,460 --> 02:06:08,660
I will be betraying our love

1215
02:06:09,380 --> 02:06:10,980
I'm sorry...

1216
02:07:17,500 --> 02:07:20,180
Why did you have to kill yourself?

1217
02:07:22,100 --> 02:07:26,620
From now, we're going
to live together!

1218
02:07:28,740 --> 02:07:30,940
Come with me

1219
02:07:34,020 --> 02:07:35,460
Amudhan

1220
02:07:39,900 --> 02:07:41,100
Amudhan

1221
02:07:52,100 --> 02:07:58,340
"You and I, Time's absurd play
Tossed astray, into the winds"

1222
02:07:58,380 --> 02:08:04,460
"Those winds now bind us
A saga, for the world to see"

1223
02:08:04,500 --> 02:08:07,620
"Divine jasmine buds,
adorning the Lord"

1224
02:08:07,700 --> 02:08:10,700
"Have found their way to my own yard"

1225
02:08:10,780 --> 02:08:16,900
"Forget me not, forever more,
Forsake me not, come calm or storm"

1226
02:08:35,060 --> 02:08:37,620
'Bhavani! Born:31-05-1985
Death:18-06-2018'

1227
02:08:40,780 --> 02:08:43,100
'Amudhan! Born:05-09-1984
Death:23-02-2019'

1228
02:08:57,700 --> 02:08:59,620
'Bhavani'

1229
02:09:10,660 --> 02:09:15,300
"Messenger clouds..."

1230
02:09:16,780 --> 02:09:19,020
"Sing my song of love..."

1231
02:09:21,420 --> 02:09:27,580
"Will the maiden's dream
forever remain a mirage?"

1232
02:09:27,660 --> 02:09:33,780
"Will the summer moon
quench her longing?"

1233
02:09:33,820 --> 02:09:37,100
"A distant sliver of light sneaks in"

1234
02:09:37,140 --> 02:09:40,100
"As the lonely flower fades in darkness "

1235
02:09:40,140 --> 02:09:43,140
"Is this just a dream..."

1236
02:09:43,180 --> 02:09:49,620
"...a fear grips the heart
as each day dawns"

1237
02:09:52,420 --> 02:09:54,060
"Messenger clouds..."

1238
02:09:54,100 --> 02:09:55,580
"Sing my song of love..."

1239
02:09:55,620 --> 02:09:58,620
"And kiss me tender as gentle rain "

1240
02:09:58,700 --> 02:10:01,780
"As the epic poet rejoices
 in our tale of love"

1241
02:10:01,820 --> 02:10:04,820
"Rainbows come waltzing back
into my life"

1242
02:10:06,460 --> 02:10:11,020
"Messenger clouds..."

1243
02:10:12,660 --> 02:10:14,900
"Sing my song of love..."

1244
02:10:42,060 --> 02:10:48,220
"You and I, Time's absurd play
 Tossed astray, into the winds"

1245
02:10:48,300 --> 02:10:54,420
"Those winds now bind us
A saga, for the world to see"

1246
02:10:54,500 --> 02:10:57,660
"Divine jasmine buds, adorning the Lord"

1247

 in our tale of love"

into my life"
