1
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,200
Stop being such pussies.
Just grab the rope.

2
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,400
No, no way.
I don't want to lose my badge.

3
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,240
If we get caught,
Bade Papa's gonna kill me.

4
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,240
Avni, it's the last day of school.

5
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,840
From tomorrow,
you're not gonna be so important.

6
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,760
Come on!

7
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,240
God save us!

8
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,200
One.

9
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,360
Two.

10
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,360
Three!

11
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,520
Run... Run...

12
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,000
Get back to your class.

13
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,880
The lecture has not ended yet.
Come on, get back.

14
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,680
Come on, return to your class.

15
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,360
No! I love you more.

16
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,520
Tchhee!
I can't wear this to the party.

17
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,920
No, I love you more.

18
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,640
No, you hang up.

19
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,240
Sakshi! What the ***!

20
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,360
Enough man.

21
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,600
As it is... You're
following Arjun to Pune.

22
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,200
How about spending
some time with us, uh?

23
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,400
Simbi is one of the top
five law colleges.

24
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,360
Huh?
We just got done with finals.

25
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,600
Why are we already
talking about college?

26
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,560
What's the rush?

27
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,240
Lets just go to
Prague for a year or two.

28
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,320
Dad just bought a villa there.

29
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,720
Wow! Prague!

30
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,600
Sounds so exotic.

31
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,560
Take me with you.
Show me some hot white guys.

32
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,520
Bade Papa has already lined up some
hillbillies for me to marry.

33
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,120
Like really long beards,
hair coming out of their ears.

34
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,240
Oh God!

35
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,600
What century does
Bade Papa live in?

36
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,440
Job, career,
nothing is important to him?

37
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,680
A girl just needs to finish school
and get her married.

38
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,240
I seriously have no
interest in getting married.

39
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,720
I just refuse to.

40
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,360
Congratulations, my Veerus.
- Hello Aunty.

41
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,520
It's Veere, Ma.
Veere, like bros.

42
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,880
Whatever.

43
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,360
You guys did it!

44
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,520
School's finally over!

45
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,800
Hey!
- What's up, girls?

46
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,800
Hello, Uncle.

47
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,960
Hi, Uncle.

48
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,960
There you go.

49
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,680
Exams are over.

50
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,680
Smile, please.

51
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,480
We're going to the club.

52
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,640
And we won't return soon.

53
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,760
Don't do anything I would.

54
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,320
Okay, girls. Cheers!

55
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,040
Guys look, champaign.

56
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,360
You're the crazy one!
You're bloody mad!

57
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,240
Kishan, how does it matter?
We eat in the club every day.

58
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,360
Absolutely not.

59
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,840
Fine then, GO!

60
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,640
And don't bother coming back!

61
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,040
If I could,
I would never come back!

62
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,840
Selfish! Bloody selfish!

63
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,920
Sushh! The girls are here.

64
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,840
This house doesn't belong
to your father.

65
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,960
Just look at him, Cookie.

66
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,800
This is the same guy
who used to come all the way

67
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,920
from Civil Lines to
GK just to say good night.

68
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,840
The girl I used to
come for wasn't MAD.

69
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,840
Marrying you was the
biggest mistake of my life.

70
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,640
This Marriage business is just a
*** hustle.

71
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,800
Guys, please.

72
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,440
This woman has destroyed my life,

73
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,160
'Parents always hide their
mistakes from their kids.'

74
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,360
You want destruction... I'll show.

75
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,480
Ritu.

76
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,840
'Well, at least we try.'

77
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,440
'We fear they might make
the same mistakes we did.'

78
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,960
'And so, we don't even let them
make their own mistakes.'

79
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,720
'By now, my daughter already knows
that life isn't a Fairytale.'

80
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,000
'But it's very important to Dream.'

81
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,680
'I think one should make
mistakes in life.'

82
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,560
'And one should
learn from them as well.'

83
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,560
'Pay for one's own mistakes
and not for someone else's.'

84
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:15,840
Listen guys, I won't be coming back
home with you guys after the party.

85
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,840
Why?

86
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,200
Actually...

87
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,600
Arjun's parents are in Shimla.

88
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,800
So we... we were thinking...

89
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,360
Shut up!
- Are you serious?

90
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,760
I mean I love him.

91
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,440
And... he's the one.

92
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,440
Oh my my! No wonder!

93
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,800
Looks like she's getting
married before me.

94
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,280
Hope you're carrying protection?

95
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,280
- Arjun!
- Shut up!

96
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,520
Arjun!

97
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,120
Meera give it back!

98
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,200
Till you don't learn
from your mistakes,

99
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,400
'how will you write
your own story?'

100
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,400
Here's to "Live life
on your own terms".

101
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,560
To Prague.
Here I come.

102
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,800
To Bade Papa.
I'm not coming.

103
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,680
To Pune.

104
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,640
Arjun, I'm coming.

105
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,680
I'm coming...

106
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,760
To Pune.

107
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,120
To us, Bros.

108
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,360
I love you guys.

109
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,760
'The biggest mistake of my life...'

110
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,520
'I died before I could say
all this to my daughter, Kalindi.'

111
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,160
"My heart, is a balloon in flight."

112
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,400
"Soaring high in the sky."

113
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,640
"My heart, is a balloon in flight."

114
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,640
"Soaring high in the sky."

115
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,360
"Invited trouble,
wicked and unholy."

116
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,960
"Got trapped ever so slowly."

117
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,520
"Was single, ready to mingle."

118
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,720
"Now have to enter
into holy matrimony."

119
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:37,040
"Unsteady, untrustworthy..."

120
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,000
"Unsteady, untrustworthy..."

121
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:48,000
"Unsteady, untrustworthy..."

122
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,080
Come on Rishabh, lets go back
it's my favorite song.

123
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,120
Kaloo, we need to talk.

124
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,680
Listen, I've been thinking
about this.

125
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,680
Like constantly.

126
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,640
We've been
together for three years now.

127
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,600
Right?

128
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,960
And we're very different people.

129
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,640
I mean... we are poles apart...

130
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,360
And... but...

131
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,080
So Kaloo...

132
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,600
Are you breaking up with me?
- Will you marry me?

133
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,400
What?
- Huh?

134
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,600
Wait... let me do this again.
I lost my momentum.

135
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,480
Yes.

136
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,920
Kalindi Puri will you marry me?

137
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,920
Baby, I'll be right back.
- Huh?

138
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,720
But...

139
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,400
***!

140
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,240
Calm down.

141
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,360
Calm down. Calm down. Calm down.

142
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,440
No, no, not for you, she's inside.
- Cute.

143
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,920
Enjoy the concert.

144
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,920
I'll just...

145
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,760
Calm down, calm down!

146
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,560
Rishabh, I can't marry you.

147
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,920
I mean not you in particular.

148
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,640
I can't marry anyone.

149
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,800
Kaloo...

150
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,640
Stop talking to yourself
like a crazy person.

151
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,400
And don't scratch yourself.

152
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,920
At least come out.

153
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,840
Rishabh, why?

154
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,040
Everything is so perfect.

155
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,040
Why are you doing this?

156
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,800
Wow!

157
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,200
Because I love you?

158
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,440
And... I want to spend the
rest of my life with you.

159
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,880
Isn't that reason enough?

160
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,120
Of course.

161
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,200
I also love you.

162
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,560
But why do we need to get married?

163
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,280
We're already living together.

164
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,040
But for how long Kaloo?

165
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,800
The Indian in me
wants to marry you.

166
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,320
Okay... You know what?

167
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,360
Forget it.

168
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,880
Rishabh,
you actually want to do this?

169
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,920
I mean like really?
- Yes.

170
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,120
Rishabh, everything changes
once you get married... trust me.

171
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,200
Maybe... but I love you.

172
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,680
And that will never change.

173
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,680
Okay.

174
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,440
Okay?

175
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,520
Is that a yes?

176
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,880
Yes.

177
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,120
I'm still scared.

178
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,920
We'll manage!

179
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,920
Your Honor,
how can she demand maintenance?

180
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,720
The facts remain that
she has emptied the entire locker.

181
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,400
And hasn't worked
a day in her life.

182
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,800
Say something.

183
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,560
And apart from creating drama,
she hasn't done much with her life.

184
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,920
She's getting what she deserves.
Zero.

185
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,520
She doesn't deserve a single penny.

186
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,000
"Unsteady, untrustworthy..."

187
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,640
Bloody ***!

188
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,440
I told you,
my office is under renovation.

189
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,840
Please send the
cheque to my house.

190
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,360
Idiot.
- Here.

191
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,840
What's going on with you?

192
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,600
And do you need
to wear these pants?

193
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,200
You look like a lesbo.

194
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,120
I have to mom,
it's the lesbian dress code.

195
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,520
Starting tomorrow,
I'll go to Court in a bikini.

196
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,080
Maybe I'll find a boy then?

197
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,560
Look at this one,
his name is Manish.

198
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,560
Here.

199
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,240
He's an engineer. American degree.

200
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,120
Annual package 2 million.
Have a look.

201
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,840
Okay, you old woman.
Okay.

202
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,760
You were always
first in everything.

203
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,960
Then why are you
behind in this matter?

204
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,880
No.. No..

205
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
But sweetheart,
it's a child restrainer.

206
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,920
No! Meera, absolutely not.

207
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,400
I'm not letting you
put our son on a leash.

208
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,880
I'm the one who has
to chase him all day.

209
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,320
Bloody nuisance.

210
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,440
Eating... nuisance...
sleeping... nuisance.

211
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,800
I would've slapped
him if we didn't live in America.

212
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,240
Hey babe.

213
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,120
Kabir's day care
is doing family trees next week.

214
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,920
Oh okay, that's nice.

215
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,240
So, we need pictures
of your family.

216
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,360
Come on.
- No.

217
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,120
Get lost.

218
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,880
Baby, please?

219
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,160
They're your family.

220
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,040
At least talk to them.

221
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,080
You're stubborn.

222
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,120
What? I'm stubborn?

223
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,640
They are stubborn.

224
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,960
Look John,
if they can't accept you

225
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,000
then I'm not interested
in talking to them.

226
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,600
End of discussion.
- Come on Meera.

227
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,600
What a surprise!
How are you doing?

228
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,040
He doesn't need restraining.

229
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,320
Just needs you
to stop spoiling him.

230
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,120
What have I done now?

231
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,480
Well, for starters, he's two
and he's still sleeping with us.

232
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,480
It's not normal.

233
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,920
I refuse to let my child sleep
alone in a room like you Americans.

234
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,840
Alright? Right, baby? Right?

235
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,360
"Was single, ready to mingle."

236
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,840
"Now have to enter
into holy matrimony."

237
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:22,440
"Unsteady, untrustworthy..."

238
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:26,840
"Unsteady, untrustworthy..."

239
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,000
Hello, Sakshi...

240
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,760
You've been back at your
parents' for quite a while now uh?

241
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,360
Hi, Kunkun Aunty. Hello, Aunty.

242
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,560
Morning, Aunty.

243
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,920
Expecting?
- Nope.

244
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,240
So when are you and Vineet
coming over?

245
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,440
Actually Aunty, he hasn't come.

246
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,520
What?

247
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,120
Is he still in London?
- Yes.

248
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,960
How does he manage alone?
- Just fine.

249
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,320
When is he coming to get you?
- Soon.

250
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,320
Your dress is very nice.
- Umm...

251
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,520
Where are you coming from?

252
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,000
From a meeting. Okay, bye.

253
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,000
Okay, meeting!
- Meeting!

254
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,880
Hi, Vineet!

255
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,920
Hello, Papa?

256
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,280
Good evening.

257
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,040
Or in your case good morning?

258
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,520
Where is Sakshi?
- Sakshi?

259
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,080
Why isn't she answering my phone?

260
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,160
Sakshi is sleeping.
- Vineet.

261
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,560
I've been trying to contact her
since two days,

262
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,720
but haven't been successful.

263
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,040
There, she's up.
- Okay.

264
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,760
Yes, Vineet?
- Sakshi.

265
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,880
Yes.

266
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,400
Why aren't you taking my calls?

267
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,080
You bloody ***!

268
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,520
How dare you call my father!

269
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,720
Listen I have a half
a mind of telling everyone...

270
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,240
what kinda girl you are

271
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,680
and what you spend
the whole day doing!

272
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,040
Who do you think you are?
I'm not even scared of my father...

273
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,480
You piece of ***!

274
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,520
Do what you want.

275
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,280
You bloody...
- Sakshi.

276
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,240
I'm sure she must be exhausted...

277
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,960
with all the work she does.
- Yes.

278
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,120
But Kavita, you don't need
to worry anymore...

279
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,000
she won't need
to work a job after marriage.

280
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,600
Our Manish is very well settled.

281
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,240
Excuse me. Tea...

282
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,560
Aaa... the cat.

283
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,040
Go with her.

284
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,560
Shanti!

285
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,800
I am tired of seeing your
black and blue face every morning.

286
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,600
Stop crying now.

287
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,280
You know, I was gonna be a doctor.

288
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,160
I would've ended up
tending to you every day.

289
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,240
Be grateful, I became a lawyer.
Today you're divorced.

290
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,320
And before that,
I am going to file an FIR.

291
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,520
No, ma'am.

292
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,080
Hi Mahesh.
- Manish.

293
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,560
Hi Manish.

294
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,640
Can I help?

295
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,000
Yeah, sure.

296
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,840
You can take this out.
Thank you.

297
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,200
One second.

298
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,880
But what about us getting married?

299
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,160
That's not happening.

300
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,080
Oh, my God!

301
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,200
What!

302
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,160
Kaloo is getting married!

303
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,400
Kaloo is getting married!

304
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,560
That flake ball... ***.

305
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,960
I want to hear
every... like every detail.

306
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,640
I want it right now.
Tell me right now.

307
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,920
Kaloo is getting married!
- Mad girl.

308
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,840
Kaloo is getting married.

309
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,320
Oh no!

310
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,680
How am I gonna break
this news to mom?

311
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,240
Sakshi, get on Skype.

312
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,880
Sakshi Soni, it's 4:00pm!
Are you still sleeping?

313
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,600
Congratulations!

314
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,520
Our friend is getting married!

315
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,600
How are you, Mother Dairy?

316
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,160
I've started packing.

317
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,680
Here, I'm packing John's
meals for next ten days.

318
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,440
Congratulations!

319
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,440
I just can't believe it.

320
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,240
How did she agree to this?
- Seriously, man.

321
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,720
Chances of her getting married
in this lifetime were so bleak.

322
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,480
I'm so happy!

323
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,560
I'm so happy for Kalindi.

324
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,720
No, you're not.

325
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,040
Is it that obvious?

326
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,080
Mom is acting like a druggie, after
I told her about Kaloo's wedding.

327
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,480
She is popping calmpose tablets
like they are M&amp;Ms.

328
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,440
"I hope my poor daughter
doesn't die single."

329
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:22,280
Be happy... at least you're single.
Think about me.

330
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,400
I'll be the only maligned
divorcee at the wedding. - Hey!

331
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,720
Aunties have already
started ***, by the way.

332
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,000
Why is she getting married so soon?

333
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,080
Rishabh just proposed to her.

334
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,680
That idiot didn't even give
time to lose weight.

335
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,800
Nothing's gonna fit.

336
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,240
Looking quite healthy,
Mother Dairy.

337
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,640
Pop a kid and then we'll talk?
- Are you nuts?

338
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,800
It's Sakshi Soni
we're talking about.

339
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,640
She'll get bored in no time and
then you'll have to raise the kid.

340
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,880
No, thank you very much.
One is more than enough.

341
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,560
Kaloo is landing today, right?

342
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,200
Are you guys going to
the airport to pick her up?

343
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,440
Her "in-laws" are.

344
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,640
Shut up!

345
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,400
She said she's going to wrap up all
the family stuff and then meet us.

346
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,280
Guys just hold on...
I'll be there in no time.

347
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,640
We can all meet her together.

348
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,600
Oh god! Bye.

349
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,280
Where are they?
- Look they are here.

350
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,120
Look they are here.
- Come on.

351
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,080
Shishu!

352
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,080
Ok... ok... let's meet him.

353
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,400
There he is.
- Hello, welcome.

354
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,320
Oh, my baby!
- God bless you.

355
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,800
How are you, Shishu?

356
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,560
Lets start the rituals.

357
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Kalindi!

358
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,720
Priest, you go there.
- Welcome, my child.

359
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,040
Priest!

360
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,160
Bless you.
- That's enough.

361
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,440
Here you go.

362
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,800
Sarita...

363
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,440
How are you, Kalindi?

364
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,560
Come here, dear.

365
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,520
No, thank you, Aunty.
- It's okay.

366
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,160
She's so beautiful.

367
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,800
Good catch.
- Papa...

368
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,840
Why are you feeling shy?

369
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,160
No more calling her aunty...

370
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,200
Call her mummy now.
- Ignore Santosh Aunty.

371
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,600
Call me whatever you feel like
I don't force anyone.

372
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,200
This is right.

373
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,000
Your mother is just too much.

374
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,520
I'll go handle her.

375
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,000
Enough Sarita.

376
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,920
You don't have to perform
all the rituals today.

377
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,600
You want her to return
from the airport itself?

378
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,280
Come dear, we'll drop you home.

379
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,640
No, my car is here.

380
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,520
Then we'll escort you to your car.
Come, come, come.

381
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,960
Here comes the bride!

382
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,560
Uncle!
- Welcome, Mrs. Malhotra!

383
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,040
Welcome, my child.

384
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,080
What's with this loud
"West Delhi" jewelry?

385
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,920
Mother-in-law.
- At the airport?

386
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,360
Ya, can you believe it?
- Fantastic.

387
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,960
Listen, you should just
get married at our house?

388
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,840
Rishabh was saying that
they have a farmhouse.

389
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,280
And we can just have all
the functions there.

390
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,040
So I've already short-listed
15-20 card designs.

391
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,720
But we'll take you to Chawri Bazaar
tomorrow anyway.

392
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,120
Oh, this is gonna be so much fun.

393
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,040
Not tomorrow.
I'm meeting dad.

394
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,400
At the club.

395
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,400
For lunch.

396
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,000
Do you guys speak often?

397
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,720
Hmmm... Yeah, I mean on birthdays,
festivals,

398
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,920
special occasions.

399
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,080
I saw him in court last month...

400
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,000
With that tacky CR Park slut.

401
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,000
Cookie!
- Sorry...

402
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,480
Lady of the night.

403
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,040
Kishan and I are so disappointed
that you aren't staying with us.

404
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,880
You should've stayed
with us this time.

405
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,720
Comfortable?

406
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,800
Next time, Paromita.
- Let it be, dear.

407
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,360
She's obviously more comfortable
at her uncle's place.

408
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,280
Okay let me know, if there's
any thing I can do for the wedding.

409
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,360
And I also wanted
you to know that...

410
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,640
We're there for you.

411
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,360
This is Mrs. Puri.

412
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,520
Yes.

413
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,440
Hi! How are you? It's been so long!

414
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,320
So he's a corporate lawyer.
Lives in GK.

415
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,440
This one?

416
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,880
I'm meeting a prospective groom.

417
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,360
Not charging by the hour.

418
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,240
Show me something knee-length.

419
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,920
Lives in GK.
He likes reading, traveling, music.

420
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,560
I think Nirmal is completely...
- Nirmal?

421
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,280
You're gonna have sex
with someone called Nirmal?

422
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,000
Sakshi, I just can't talk to you.

423
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,920
Like Vineet is a very cool name!

424
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,240
No chance! 126 days, not a drag.

425
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,440
By the way, your market
value has really dropped...

426
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,640
after banging your boss.

427
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,720
That's disgusting, Sakshi.
Language.

428
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,840
And I wasn't "banging" him.

429
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,520
We were in a relationship.

430
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,760
Er... Avni, he was married.

431
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,600
With kids.
- I didn't know that.

432
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,040
He's the one who was married.
He's the one who had kids.

433
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,160
But I got branded as
the whore of Tees Hazari!

434
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,360
*** double standards!

435
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,640
Why do I end up
with all the freaks?

436
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:17,680
So you thought... this time
I'll just let Mummy decide!?

437
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,880
So?
What's wrong with that?

438
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,680
I don't know about you,
but I don't want to be alone.

439
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,640
I want everything.

440
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,280
Marriage, kids, I want it.

441
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,440
I want it all.

442
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,400
Hello, hello, give it to me baby!

443
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,120
Sakshi! Put it back!
- You are a complete package.

444
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,920
Saint on the outside...
slut on the inside.

445
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,440
That horny boss of yours must
have loved you.

446
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,560
Eh... Nirmal?

447
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,440
Avni! Hi.

448
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,840
Nice to meet you.
- So nice to meet you.

449
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,320
Yeah.

450
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,920
Yeah that's...
But let's talk about you.

451
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,600
So you are lawyer at Tees Hazari?
That's really good.

452
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,440
Please!! Have you
ever been to Tees Hazari?

453
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,160
Paan-stained corridors,

454
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,240
pathetic canteen and bathrooms...
quite a sight.

455
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,880
Yeah. Very dirty.

456
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,800
You corporate lawyers have it good.

457
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:14,040
AC offices, top shot clients,
holidays in Spain.

458
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,560
How do you know
that I went to Spain?

459
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,840
How do you know?

460
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,200
Actually...

461
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,120
Actually, I...
I checked you out on Facebook.

462
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,160
Sorry.
- Excuse me.

463
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,240
Yes, Mamma?
- What're you doing?

464
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,240
You guys are talking?

465
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,400
'Nirmal?'

466
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,720
'You're gonna have sex
with someone called Nirmal?'

467
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,680
No. Just... having dinner. Tell me.

468
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,120
Don't forget to
discuss the contract.

469
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,360
Better safe than sorry.
- No, it's okay.

470
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,240
Okay, I'll be there.
Good night.

471
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,480
Mom.

472
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,160
You're pretty close to you mom huh?

473
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,480
Yeah. Very.

474
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,640
Me too.

475
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:59,000
Avni, can I ask you something?

476
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,680
Yeah sure, go ahead.

477
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,920
See, I know this may sound
a little unromantic, but...

478
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,160
What do you think about signing
a contract before marriage?

479
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,240
A contract?

480
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,680
You mean like a prenup?

481
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,920
Please don't misunderstand.

482
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,560
Everything is so
complicated these days that...

483
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,880
I mean, I just...

484
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,080
Frankly, It's important
for both of us.

485
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,960
And mamma was also saying that...

486
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,440
Of course not. I'm a lawyer.

487
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,440
I mean, in fact,
I'm a divorce lawyer.

488
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,960
Who will understand
this better than me?

489
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,200
I really like you.

490
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,040
I really do.

491
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:46,040
'You are invited to bless the
maariage of Rishab and Kalandi.'

492
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,440
Come.

493
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,280
"Teri Maa Ka Phone Meri
Maa Ka Phone Sab Ki Maa Ka.."

494
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,720
"Maa Ka Phone Aaya
Maa Ka Phone Aaya."

495
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,120
Yes, Mother?
- Kunkun Aunty called.

496
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,840
Were you having some
sort of an affair in London?

497
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,000
I am gonna ***
that Kunkun Aunty up. I will...

498
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,840
Vineet's aunt was telling her that.

499
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,440
Mom, please stop listening
to all the *** these aunties say.

500
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,280
Goodbye.
- Bye.

501
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,880
Bloody dog...

502
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,320
Who was it?

503
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,360
No one. Airtel.

504
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,720
Listen...

505
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,160
Had Vineet asked you to
sign a contract before marriage

506
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,120
would you have gone ahead?

507
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,280
With what face?
That cheap ***

508
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,080
I am the one who should
have asked for a contract.

509
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,680
Hmm.

510
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,800
Has Meera landed?
- Yes, just.

511
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,320
Hey Bride-to-be,
lets see that face!

512
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,360
Missed you.

513
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,720
Hi, baby.
- Hello?

514
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,840
Kalindi? It's me, Mamma.

515
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,200
Yes, Aunty!

516
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,160
Actually, Shishu is sleeping.

517
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,200
I needed that ring.

518
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,200
Ring? What ring?

519
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,640
The one he proposed to you with.

520
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,560
He'll give you back
at the engagement function.

521
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,760
Shishu is absolutely useless.
He forgot to tell you.

522
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,200
One more thing,

523
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,560
according to our customs,
we'll present you with a veil.

524
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,040
Keep it carefully, you'll need to
use it for...

525
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,520
the annual marital fast.
- Okay.

526
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,400
You might want to
write all this down.

527
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,920
You'll need rock salt.

528
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,400
Dear, we also believe in...
- Okay, Aunty.

529
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,800
We 'll also be performing
a ceremony to welcome you. - Okay.

530
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,640
Also we worship the Goddess of...

531
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,760
Got all that?
That's all.

532
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,200
Okay, Aunty.
- Okay, dear.

533
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,600
Okay.

534
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,040
Help! Come over ASAP!

535
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,480
Move... you're half blind.

536
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,280
Golguppas... for everyone!
And keep them coming.

537
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,960
Only diet ones for her.
- What the hell! No.

538
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,240
Then she says,
I have so many ideas.

539
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,280
I suggest we do a theme. I suggest
we serve a Bengali fish dish.

540
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,920
I suggest you go *** yourself.

541
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,480
What happened?

542
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,960
So is Paromita going to sit beside
Uncle at the wedding ceremony?

543
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,360
What? No.

544
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,400
Actually, *** it. Let her.
I just don't care anymore.

545
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,080
Cookie Uncle is gonna shoot her.

546
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,120
I'm tired of making
all these decisions.

547
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,360
Check out some of Avni's
potential husbands.

548
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,480
Driver...

549
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,680
Orphan, rapist!
- Stop it.

550
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,080
This one, below poverty line.

551
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,440
Arranged marriage?

552
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,800
I mean Avni seriously!

553
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,360
Inspite of being with Rishabh
for three years, I'm *** scared.

554
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,640
Thank you.
Knock some sense into her.

555
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,560
You had a love marriage.
Had fun?

556
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,720
It didn't even last a year bro.

557
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,560
Guys, I love him.

558
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,080
Remember?

559
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:08,280
"Papa... Papa I wanna have a
destination wedding, okay?"

560
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,000
Somehow you guys always
end up riding my ass?

561
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,920
Because it's you. Can't help it!

562
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,280
Anyway, I am almost thirty.

563
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,240
You get introduced through friends
or parents, it's the same thing.

564
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,760
Please Avni,
stop quoting your mother.

565
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:25,280
Let me be! Just let me be... Aunty.
Yes, Aunty?

566
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,320
I just wanted to discuss
the timing for the meet

567
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,680
and greet function tomorrow.
- How much do I have to pay you?

568
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,320
Our priest suggested that you
should come between 8:30 and 9:00.

569
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,520
Okay? I don't like to force you.

570
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,040
But our priest suggested,

571
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,680
since you'll be coming home
for the first time...

572
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,160
it should be
at an auspicious hour. Okay?

573
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,400
No, everything will be very casual.
There is no formality.

574
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,840
Its just our families meeting.

575
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,960
So just wear something
white or red.

576
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,200
Keep this here.
Be careful.

577
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,080
These have to be delivered
at the groom's house.

578
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,560
What happened?
- Avni!

579
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,240
Arjun!
- How are you?

580
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,360
Hi... I... I'm good.

581
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,160
Congratulations.
- What the ***!

582
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,080
Your child?

583
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,880
It... it... it's not mine.
That's Meera's son.

584
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,040
Oh.

585
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,400
How is aunty?

586
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,800
Just as she was... Crazy.

587
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,000
I'm glad you changed your mind.

588
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,240
About?
- Kids.

589
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,400
Yeah. That...

590
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,960
He's very cute.

591
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,320
Dear let's go.

592
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,880
I gotta go. So... See you.

593
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,440
Ok... Bye.

594
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,760
My baby.

595
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,200
So you and Vineet...?

596
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,360
Are you sure?

597
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,920
Can I say I don't know?

598
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Just don't say anything
to Avni, please.

599
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:10,400
So after this epic disaster of
yours, any marriage advice for me?

600
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,520
Yes. Run *** run!

601
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,520
"Doors are closed,
walls are thick to boost."

602
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,760
"Why do you hesitate..."

603
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,840
"just drop the bass."
- Don't you know how to drive?

604
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:25,080
Bharat Matrimony has sent the
profiles of three more boys.

605
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,360
I really liked one of them.

606
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,920
He's very nice.
He's tall, fair and has a good job.

607
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,360
Just missing a few
strands hair on his head.

608
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,680
"There's so much to say,
lazy nights are wasting away."

609
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,240
"Make these nights lively,
drop the bass, anyway."

610
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,240
"I'd say no otherwise..."

611
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,160
"I'd say no otherwise..."

612
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:51,000
"Today my inhibitions
have gone for a ride."

613
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:56,120
"I won't give in without a fight."

614
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,320
"Drop the bass, mate."

615
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,440
All right ladies.

616
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,640
We are officially in
west side of Delhi now.

617
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,720
I should've worn
a traditional dress.

618
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,920
"Love is..."

619
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,800
You should've
brought Keshav Uncle with you.

620
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,720
Malhotras should meet our family,

621
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,520
one fruit basket at a time.
- Don't touch, it's looking good.

622
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,240
Hey, I don't mind!

623
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,600
My look!

624
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,160
Her father will never
stop being stingy.

625
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,920
He brings one bottle with
him and that too some local ***.

626
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,640
Hi, Uncle. Hi, Aunty.
- Hi uncle. Hello ma'am.

627
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,200
Kishan.

628
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,760
Hello, Cookie.

629
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,200
Shall we?

630
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,040
Did you take out
the booze from the car?

631
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,440
Hello uncle.
- After you.

632
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,000
Come. Come.

633
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,920
Aunty!

634
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,320
She is your mother-in-law's
husband's sister's grand daughter.

635
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,880
Kalindi, why don't you
give us a Shishu Junior soon.

636
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,480
Right, Sarita?

637
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,320
Aunty?

638
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,240
Are you alright?

639
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,320
You know,
I always wanted a daughter.

640
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:25,280
So when Shishu was young,
I loved dressing him up... frocks

641
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,880
clips...

642
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,200
I'm glad you've
come into our lives.

643
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,680
I was in fact going to suggest
the community hall.

644
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,080
Community hall?

645
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,760
Oh God! Take me.

646
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,640
What will people think!?

647
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,240
A farmhouse has a charm of its own.

648
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,640
We were actually hoping for
a destination wedding.

649
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,240
'Destination wedding?'

650
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,880
Can I make it hard?

651
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,520
What?
- The drink.

652
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,920
No, thank you.

653
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,320
Are you from Khalsa College?

654
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,680
Not at all.

655
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,400
KMC?

656
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,360
Actually, Simbi.

657
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,520
Ah... Pune!

658
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,920
I've done my fair share
of dirty dancing there!

659
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,720
I haven't been for a while.

660
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,160
That's too bad.

661
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,920
I'm sure the girls
of Pune must be in despair.

662
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,520
Excuse me, please.

663
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,760
Beautiful.

664
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,080
And our guest
list is pretty big.

665
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,560
Tell me... how are 1000 people.
- 1000 people.

666
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,680
Supposed to fit
in a community hall?

667
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,440
Right.
- You don't understand.

668
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,200
'A thousand guests?'

669
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,560
Can you see this colorful circus
she is marrying into?

670
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,760
As if yours was intimate
private affair!?

671
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,160
Make it stronger.
- Papa?

672
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,960
1000 guests?

673
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,400
We had decided not to have
more than 200 guests.

674
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,040
We've emptied many a bottle
at other people's weddings.

675
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,680
Now when it's our turn to host,

676
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,280
should we...
just show them the finger!?

677
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,920
What sh*t he talks.

678
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,120
Uncle, we wanted to keep it simple.

679
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,640
Kalindi, I've been dreaming about
his wedding since he was a baby.

680
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,960
Besides,
you guys don't even live here.

681
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,840
Mom what's the need
for all this fuss?

682
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,440
Honestly, we'll be happy
to get married in a temple.

683
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,280
Have you been smoking weed?

684
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,800
Get married in a temple.

685
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,560
You tell me.

686
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,200
This is the first wedding
in the family. - Yes.

687
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,640
Don't we need to
maintain relations face society?

688
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,600
Bro, I don't see
your wife anywhere?

689
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,160
No, I'm happily unmarried.

690
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,480
Oh!
Best decision you've made.

691
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,640
What did I ask you?

692
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,120
I'm really sorry, Kaloo.

693
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,200
You know what, I'm just gonna
go down and ask them to *** off.

694
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,320
Wait.

695
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,280
Relax.

696
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,080
Don't pick a fight.

697
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,800
Your mom is so excited.
She'll be hurt.

698
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,160
What other choice do we have?

699
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,880
I know.

700
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,280
It's just a matter of a few days.

701
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,560
We'll manage.

702
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,160
I love you, Kaloo.

703
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,400
You are..
- Sarita.

704
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,440
There they are!
- Oh no.

705
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,640
Santosh Aunty...
- Yes.

706
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,280
Hello.
- And mummy too.

707
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,320
How did you like your room?
Nice, isn't it?

708
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,280
Forget all this and come with me.

709
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,480
I want to show you something.

710
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,720
C'mon, hurry up. Come with me.

711
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,760
Where do you think you're going?
Stay here.

712
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,000
I should stay here.

713
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,680
See? How pretty it is!

714
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,120
You're going to look
like a fairy princess in it.

715
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,960
And Kalindi, you can easily
wear it in Australia as well.

716
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,240
Rishabh! Rishabh!

717
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,840
Go home, I'll join you.

718
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,120
When I got married,
I weighed only 42 kilos.

719
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,040
I wore western clothes,
just like you do.

720
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,280
Kalindi,
did you see their drawing room?

721
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,840
Brother?
- Hmm?

722
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,520
Tell me what you feel about this
for the Sangeet Function?

723
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,600
For you?

724
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,160
For her.

725
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,200
Fantastic!
Let's make her try it on.

726
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,520
"Elders advice."

727
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,200
"Dressing up is a vice."

728
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,840
"Be careful, for you'll set fire."

729
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,640
"If you dress up to aspire,
everyone's gonna admire."

730
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,960
"I'll put on a bright lipstick..."

731
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,520
"Walk in a short skirt, I admit."

732
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,080
"Dance in the club,
like I give a ***."

733
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,720
"If you dress up to aspire,
everyone's gonna admire."

734
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,640
"Dress up all you want today."

735
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,200
"Dance as much as you want today."

736
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,600
"I'm crazy about you,
for you, I'd even keep god at bay."

737
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,960
"Lose your inhibitions..."

738
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:42,840
"Lose your inhibitions."
"Let go of the traditions."

739
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:47,880
"Lose your inhibitions.
"Let go of the traditions."

740
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:53,240
"Lose your inhibitions.
"Let go of the traditions."

741
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,000
Meera, I'm taking
Kabir to the park...

742
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,320
Will be back in half an hour.
- Okay, Aunty.

743
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,000
Absolutely. Please.

744
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,640
Okay. - Kabir,
don't trouble grandma, okay?

745
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,240
Okay, Mamma.

746
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,440
What?
- Grandma! ***, grandma?

747
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,320
You're gonna leave

748
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,720
and then grandma's gonna
make my life miserable.

749
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:16,120
"Let the world taunt,
we don't care a damn."

750
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:21,400
"Lose your inhibitions.
Let go of the traditions."

751
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:26,320
"We will do what
our hearts say we can."

752
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,440
"Lose your inhibitions.
Let go of the traditions."

753
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,760
"Dress up all you want today."

754
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,400
"Dance as much as you want today."

755
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:41,680
"I'm crazy about you,
for you, I'd even keep god at bay."

756
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,360
"Lose your inhibitions.
Let go of the traditions."

757
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:51,600
"Lose your inhibitions.
Let go of the traditions."

758
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:57,040
"Lose your inhibitions.
Let go of the traditions."

759
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:02,200
"Lose your inhibitions.
Let go of the traditions."

760
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:06,800
"Lose your inhibitions.
Let go of the traditions."

761
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,560
"Lose your inhibitions..."

762
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:26,040
Have designers in Delhi
lost their mind?

763
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,400
Everyone in Delhi
has lost their mind. - Seriously.

764
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,560
If you want to afford one of these,
sell off your kidneys.

765
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,040
Bade Papa!

766
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,600
Bade Papa?
- Go.

767
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,360
Do not come to us,
when your husband leaves you.

768
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,840
Go say something.

769
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,760
Go, Meera.

770
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,120
Yes, I am fine.

771
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,200
I... I guess I just
didn't expect to see him.

772
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,160
No John, you don't have to come.

773
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,920
Yeah, I'm sure.

774
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,760
Enough bro!

775
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,000
How much are you
planning on drinking?

776
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,320
You only have one liver.

777
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,280
Here.
- Bye, I love you.

778
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,080
Bye.

779
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:17,040
Why haven't you told
Bade Papa about Kabir yet?

780
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,520
Why should I?

781
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,440
He hasn't accepted my husband yet.

782
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,960
Not accepting John is still fine.

783
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:32,320
But honestly, if he says anything
against Kabir... I mean even just,

784
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,200
Are you happy?

785
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,760
Darling who wouldn't
be happy with John's john?

786
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,960
Well done.
- Sick!

787
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,080
Thank the stars that John...

788
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,080
doesn't understand
half the *** you say.

789
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,560
He is learning Hindi these days.

790
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:53,560
He's been at it with those English
to Hindi dictionaries.

791
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:58,280
Oh by the way, guess what an orgasm
is called in Hindi, ladies.

792
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,240
Pleasure Peak.

793
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,000
Pleasure WHAT?

794
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:05,000
Peak, baby... Peak.

795
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,680
Kkkkkkk.
- Shall we?

796
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,800
Let's go find Pleasure Peak.

797
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,080
Let's go to Kaloo's house.

798
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,320
Meera, quit messing around.

799
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,840
Why, aren't you Ms. Fitness?

800
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,600
You're the voluptuous one.
- Avni!

801
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,480
Guys, this is illegal.

802
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,320
Shaanti Niwas now looks
more like a haunted house. - ***

803
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:31,800
Look at the condition
of this place...

804
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,640
Your dad and Cookie Uncle
should sell it off to some builder.

805
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,680
Ya... and just be done with it.

806
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,520
Wow!

807
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,000
Bro...

808
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,320
Cookie Uncle has hit the jackpot.

809
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,800
I can't believe he has all of this.

810
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,600
He has everything.

811
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,400
Wow, look at this dress guys!

812
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:09,240
Kaloo, is this dress still here?

813
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,920
Kaloo...
So, what happened exactly?

814
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:55,440
I know that after aunty passed away

815
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,120
uncle married Paromita...

816
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,000
like immediately.

817
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,760
Ya I ran off to Australia.

818
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,880
After that, dad and Cookie
uncle started fighting.

819
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,520
Yelling... shouting everyday.

820
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,120
She can sell whatever she wants.

821
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,120
No, she cannot.

822
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,520
She will!
- She can't!

823
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,480
One day Dad and Paromita
went out of town.

824
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,280
And then Cookie Uncle...

825
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:21,160
Wow, he pulled a big one.

826
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,840
They've been fighting
in court ever since.

827
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:31,160
You guys know me... I have
no interest in getting married.

828
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:32,840
Then why are you?

829
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,000
For Rishabh... Obviously.

830
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,360
But you know what?

831
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,240
Sometimes I feel like
I'm making a mistake.

832
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,720
Kalindi, you love this guy, right?

833
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,480
Obviously, I love him.

834
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,520
But these new relationships...

835
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,360
and how to deal with them,
what to say to whom and how.

836
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,040
It's so exhausting.

837
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:54,120
Just Wait,
this is only the beginning.

838
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,440
Vineet's *** of a mother used
to land up every two months.

839
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,560
Sakshi, when will you have kids?

840
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,440
Let's not forget dad
and uncle's cold war.

841
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,520
I wish mom were here.

842
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,960
How am I gonna do this without her?

843
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,760
Oh Kaloo!

844
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,880
We're here for you.

845
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,560
Good! Save me when
I end up killing everyone.

846
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,400
Kaloo, I am a matrimonial lawyer.

847
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,280
I am fed up of explaining
this to you guys.

848
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,560
Aww.
- Aww.

849
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,280
Guys, I have some good news.

850
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:29,760
Don't overact...

851
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,280
But I've decided
to shortlist Nirmal.

852
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:33,840
Huh?

853
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,280
Why? Because of Arjun?

854
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,680
Whatever that was 10 years ago.

855
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,400
Arjun is history.

856
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:46,400
So the fact that
you met him last week...

857
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:49,800
with his wife and child, has
nothing to do with this obviously?

858
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,400
Not at all.

859
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,400
Listen...

860
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,200
When are you going to
introduce us to your Nirmu?

861
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,640
Nirmu, Nirmu!

862
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,400
*** me, Nirmu!
- Amazing!

863
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:09,480
Please *** me, Nirmu!
Back off!

864
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:16,840
[CHANTING PRAYERS]

865
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:39,320
Goyal, I am gonna *** you up.
Understood?

866
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,960
Just release my shipment, okay?

867
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,720
Hail the Goddess!

868
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:48,880
Look at that one.
Just... just Look at him!

869
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,320
Why don't I just get married
right now? Priest is also here.

870
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:56,640
Why this granny bun?

871
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,400
Couldn't you let them loose?

872
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,240
Waiter, where's the bar?

873
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,240
C'mon don't say that!

874
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,240
That's a brand new waistcoat.

875
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:13,600
Bhandari.

876
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,240
Looking for alcohol?

877
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,600
Can the Bride's parents,
come forward please.

878
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,240
Please proceed.

879
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,480
The Bride's parents.

880
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,360
Mamma, I want more.

881
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,440
God only knows when
you'll give me grandkids.

882
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:41,160
I don't have to marry for that.

883
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:46,640
If you carry on like this,
We'll have to freeze your eggs.

884
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,040
Mamma!

885
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:50,840
No, we're pretty close to it.

886
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:52,360
We're like ten minutes away
from the beach.

887
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,560
How lovely.

888
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,720
Kishan, I can't believe you
went all the way to Australia...

889
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,240
and didn't see a single beach.

890
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,720
You came to Australia?

891
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,880
Yes, I had some urgent work.

892
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,800
Morning in evening out.

893
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,360
Did you try the sweets, Uncle?

894
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:19,240
Sarita...

895
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,880
They're right here!

896
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,160
Your mom and dad have left?

897
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,680
Did they eat lunch.

898
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,840
Santosh Aunty,
I have repeatedly told you that

899
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,000
she's not Kalindi's mother.
Stop calling her that.

900
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,800
Then what do I call her?

901
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,800
This is my step.

902
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,280
You do this one.

903
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,840
And then like this.

904
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,360
This one is mine.

905
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,600
He is here now.

906
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:45,280
What happened?
- Let's go.

907
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,440
Look they are going again.

908
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:48,880
These guys are too much.

909
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,320
Nirmal.

910
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,640
Hi.
- Hi.

911
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:53,720
Who is he?

912
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:56,480
Now who is he?
- There he is. Go.

913
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,000
Hi.
- Hi. Eh... come.

914
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,680
Those are my friends. - Sir,
need money to pay the florist.

915
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:02,920
Come.

916
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,360
Take this.
- Thank you, sir.

917
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:08,800
Can I get something for you?
- No, that's okay.

918
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:10,560
Come, cheers.
What's that behind?

919
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:15,360
Aunty, you see this grass?
Brand new from Japan.

920
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,120
Not bad, eh.

921
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:19,640
Yeah, not bad.
- Your "Nirmu" is quite hot.

922
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,040
I say jump him.

923
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,560
Are you mad?

924
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,480
Not before anything's fixed.

925
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:25,800
What?

926
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,960
I won't even buy a car
without a test drive first.

927
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:31,080
She has packed her
"goodies" airtight...

928
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,240
no one can even
get a whiff of it.

929
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,240
While they have generously
been distributed...

930
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:35,720
around her office
just last month.

931
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:38,600
"My mesmerizing eyes shine bright."

932
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:41,480
"Many go wayward,
when I come in sight."

933
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:44,360
"When I groove,
they make their move."

934
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,040
"My hot body on fire
is what they desire."

935
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:50,680
Wow chubby, I didn't think you'd
be able to pull off these moves.

936
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,400
I thought you couldn't dance
to save your life. - Thank you.

937
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,400
You alcoholic less drinking...

938
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,560
more dancing.

939
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,160
He also choreographed
Saifeena's wedding.

940
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,240
"My mesmerizing eyes shine bright."

941
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:07,120
"Many go wayward,
when I come in sight."

942
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,960
"When I groove,
they make their move."

943
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:12,520
"My hot body on fire
is what they desire."

944
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,360
"Don't be lazy, go for a quickie."

945
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:18,640
"I have hots for you!"
- Yes, mom.

946
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:20,960
"Hey, the one with
naughty intentions..."

947
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,120
"Come on, let me..."

948
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:25,080
"Kiss you."

949
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,880
"Kiss you."

950
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:30,760
"Kiss you."

951
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,200
"Come on, let me..."

952
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:36,600
"Kiss you."

953
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:39,440
"Kiss you."

954
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,400
"Kiss you."

955
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:48,680
Sarita,
we're bringing home an angel.

956
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,160
I swear.

957
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,320
Hey, come on.

958
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:02,240
Oh you guys.

959
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,400
Hey kabir.

960
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,360
I really missed you.

961
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,200
Alright. Okay.

962
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:10,840
Tag... you're it.

963
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:22,440
Now, Sakshi put the garland
around Kabir.

964
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,240
Shut it off.

965
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:28,000
This is so depressing.

966
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,080
Sweetheart...

967
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,080
We blew up 35 million
on her wedding.

968
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,760
Let's watch what we paid for...

969
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,600
Let's watch the movie
since we are home.

970
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,520
It will be entertaining.

971
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,360
***.

972
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:52,280
I'm Mrs. Malhotra.

973
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:00,080
Kaloo! Hurry up.
We are getting late.

974
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,280
Coming!

975
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,280
Be careful with your dress.

976
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,880
***.

977
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:42,360
Welcome my dear. Welcome.
- Welcome my dear. Welcome.

978
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,880
I don't see your parents?

979
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:44,920
Oh, your uncle is here.

980
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,520
Welcome...

981
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,560
That'll do.

982
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:52,400
Come, dear. Come along.

983
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:53,840
Yes, we're coming. Please go ahead.

984
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,000
But she'll be all alone.

985
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:57,960
Ladies and Gentleman, please
proceed to the stage...

986
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,560
to meet and greet Kalindi
and Rishabh

987
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,080
and give them your blessings.
- Oh, my baby!

988
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,640
Not on the stage, Aunty!

989
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,200
Aunty!

990
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:08,840
Cameraman, photo!

991
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,200
Take it from the center.

992
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,880
From the center.

993
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,040
Hey, Moonga Uncle is here.

994
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,200
Mr. Moonga!
- Come Rishab.

995
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:21,240
Don't worry, he'll come.

996
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,040
Baby, I'll be right back.

997
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,160
Her father will be here soon.

998
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,920
Papa's still not here.

999
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,320
Probably on his way.
I'll go and check.

1000
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,240
Where are the ***
I call my friends?

1001
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:39,480
Nothing but strings today?

1002
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:40,960
Upping your game, eh?

1003
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:49,040
Guys, I'm thinking... I'll
atleast kiss him tonight.

1004
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,280
Yeah baby... just jump him!

1005
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,040
Yeah?
- Just do it.

1006
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,320
There he is.

1007
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,640
Go, show him your true colors.

1008
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,000
Nirmal...

1009
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:03,120
Hi.
- Hi.

1010
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:04,240
Wow!

1011
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:07,160
You look like...

1012
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,680
Wow.
- Thanks.

1013
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,400
Where is Rishab?

1014
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,400
Have you seen Rishabh anywhere?

1015
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,120
He must be around somewhere.

1016
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,360
I'll go find him.

1017
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:27,680
Hey, hello.

1018
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,920
What are you looking at?
Delete that.

1019
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,000
Get me some more.

1020
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:46,160
"Let's groove together tonight
like never before."

1021
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,720
Tonight...

1022
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,720
It's on.
- And you...?

1023
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,640
Double on.
- Amazing.

1024
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,240
What should I do?

1025
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,360
Nirmu, Nirmu!

1026
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:18,760
Nirmal, I...

1027
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:20,480
Nirmal...
- Avni...

1028
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:23,040
I'm looking for a wife,
not a hookup.

1029
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:24,800
But...
- I'm sorry I wasted your time.

1030
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:26,160
But what have I done?

1031
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,480
Please go inside,
you're embarrassing yourself.

1032
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,320
Because I tried to kiss you?

1033
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,800
You... You...

1034
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,000
You... ***.

1035
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:41,280
Who do you think you are?
You're just a glorified clerk!

1036
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,080
You think you will reject me?

1037
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,280
I reject you and your contract.

1038
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,160
Don't create a scene,
everyone's watching.

1039
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,080
Do you know what's the
problem with guys like you?

1040
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,560
You think you want "a modern,
independent wife."

1041
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,640
But the truth is,
you just want a maid...

1042
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:55,880
in the background who nods along.

1043
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,560
Mister, you cannot
handle a woman like me. - Listen...

1044
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,960
And what kind of a name is Nirmal?

1045
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,720
Why are you getting...
- Let me guess.

1046
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,040
Your mother must have named you.

1047
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:06,800
You know what it's bloody stupid.

1048
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:08,240
Go back to your mama.

1049
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,320
Actually,
go marry your mother only.

1050
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:11,600
Crazy ***!

1051
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:14,160
Bloody mother lover!

1052
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:22,800
Get in.

1053
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,480
So you kissed him and he bounced?

1054
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:29,600
For god's sake, keep your
crappy advice to yourself.

1055
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:31,520
I should've never
listened to you guys.

1056
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,960
You mean he actually said no.

1057
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,160
So basically, he's gay.

1058
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,200
Yes.

1059
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:42,680
I made a complete ass of myself.

1060
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:43,840
***!

1061
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,240
Give me a drag.

1062
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,520
You sure... 126 days...

1063
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:55,200
Smoking is injurious to
your health and your disposition.

1064
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:02,960
Did you notice... she's
here today as well.

1065
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,800
I mean she is getting a divorce.

1066
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,120
It's no small matter.

1067
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,400
The girl has no shame at all.

1068
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:10,240
She drinks straight up.

1069
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,880
Really? I've heard
she's into drugs as well.

1070
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,040
Shameless.

1071
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,120
Poor parents.

1072
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,640
Her father used to
prowl around like a proud lion.

1073
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,560
Have you seen him
lately... like a pussy cat.

1074
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,280
Obviously.

1075
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:25,640
Spent so much on that wedding...
didn't even last six months.

1076
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,560
He can't show his face to anyone.

1077
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:31,040
The mother has stopped
stepping out of the house.

1078
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,160
She doesn't even come
to the country club.

1079
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,720
The daughter on the other hand...
refuses to leave the nightclub.

1080
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:39,000
Vineet's aunt was saying that
she is having an affair.

1081
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:40,720
Really?
- Really?

1082
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:42,400
What a mess.

1083
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:43,800
Forget it. Who cares?

1084
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:47,080
True... true...
why should we bother! - Let's go.

1085
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:50,080
Now let's proceed
towards the stage...

1086
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:54,440
for a dance performance
by Rishabh, Kalindi and friends.

1087
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:57,480
There was a girl, a little crazy...

1088
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:59,840
She had secretly fallen in love.

1089
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:05,320
"All my admirers
offer to drop me home."

1090
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,160
"Lost in love, they whisper
sweet nothings at gloam."

1091
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,640
"Some are dating
and some are waiting."

1092
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:11,080
"Some are stalking
and some are talking."

1093
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,600
"Some just want some lip-locking."

1094
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:16,480
"Don't be lazy, go for a quickie."

1095
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:19,720
"I have hots for you!"

1096
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:22,040
"Hey, the one with
naughty intentions..."

1097
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,000
"Come on, let me..."

1098
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:25,640
"What?"

1099
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,880
"Kiss you."

1100
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,120
"Kiss you."

1101
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:33,840
"Kiss you."

1102
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:36,480
"Come let me..."

1103
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,800
"Kiss you."

1104
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:42,000
"Kiss you."

1105
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:44,920
"Kiss you."

1106
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:07,440
"Kiss you."

1107
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,560
You're hammered.
- No, you're hammered.

1108
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:22,200
How does one get out of here?

1109
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:23,840
Going for a smoke?

1110
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:27,000
No I was going to the bathroom,
but why not?

1111
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:28,400
Okay.

1112
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,480
You're looking hot tonight.
- Hey, one large whiskey.

1113
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:33,160
What kind of a person are you?

1114
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:35,280
I don't have time
for your nonsense.

1115
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,160
It seems you don't even have
time to call your daughter.

1116
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,720
You didn't have time
to meet her in Australia.

1117
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:41,040
And now you *** don't have
time to attend her wedding?

1118
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,840
Why does she need me?

1119
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,720
Her father is already here.

1120
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:47,160
***!

1121
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:50,200
Guys... tonight we drink like dogs.

1122
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:51,720
Ready?

1123
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,240
One... Two...

1124
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,440
Three, go!

1125
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:00,880
After the scintillating
performance...

1126
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,400
It is time for ring ceremony.

1127
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:08,480
"The moon coyly hides
behind the clouds, my love..."

1128
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,680
Said Rishabh to Kalindi
when he saw her.

1129
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:14,000
She is so beautiful.

1130
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:16,480
Yes she is, Grandma.
This is just like a fairytale.

1131
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:21,160
Let him go! Stop it! Let him go!

1132
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:22,880
You scoundrel!
- Listen to me!

1133
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:28,320
On my finger is a ring
and in the ring is a diamond.

1134
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:29,920
Applause.

1135
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:45,160
It's different.
- It's different, isn't it?

1136
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:48,600
This moon, the golden tree...
very different decoration.

1137
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,080
In fact different theme only.

1138
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:54,280
It's bigger.
- Show me.

1139
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:56,760
How did this get bigger?

1140
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:01,080
Nothing.

1141
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,160
Must be a mix up.
Don't worry about it.

1142
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,640
Have you lost your mind
after coming

1143
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:07,600
to Delhi or are you just blind?

1144
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:09,120
We'll get our ring back.

1145
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:10,440
Don't worry.

1146
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:13,080
It's not about the ring, Rishabh.
It's about everything.

1147
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,120
Are we getting married
for ourselves, or these people?

1148
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,000
This is a non-stop circus.

1149
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:20,080
What the ***is happening man?

1150
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:21,480
Bloody henpecked husband!

1151
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,120
I am. Yes, I am.

1152
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:26,560
At least I don't go around
hiding my relationship.

1153
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:28,920
You're a coward.
Bloody coward.

1154
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:30,880
There's a limit to showing off!

1155
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,320
Why does everything
has to be so over-the-top!

1156
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:34,320
Big ring,
big necklace, big function!

1157
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:37,400
Tomorrow if we have kids, is
this what we're gonna teach them?

1158
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:39,880
I don't know what's wrong with you.
I think you've lost your mind.

1159
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,320
Your family has lost their mind.

1160
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:43,760
At least I have one.

1161
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:49,880
I'm really sorry!

1162
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:51,640
I'm really sorry,
I didn't mean to say that.

1163
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:52,840
I swear...

1164
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:54,600
Oh no! What happened?

1165
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:56,560
Rishabh?

1166
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:59,560
Go and see if he's hurt.
- Shishu?

1167
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,840
Call the ambulance.

1168
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:04,000
Are you hurt? Shishu?
- Rishabh?

1169
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:05,920
Shishu?

1170
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:09,880
Are you fine?
- Are you fine?

1171
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:11,680
Rishabh?
- Shishu?

1172
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:13,440
Rishabh?
- Shishu?

1173
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,880
'She is making a lot of mistakes.'

1174
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Shishu?
- Brother?

1175
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:19,000
Rishabh?

1176
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:20,760
Rishabh, are you alright?

1177
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,520
Are you fine?
- Yes.

1178
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,200
Where's Kalindi?

1179
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,120
'People will say, had I been there
I would have...'

1180
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:34,720
reasoned it out with her,
scolded her.

1181
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:38,640
'But it's her life
and she has to live it.'

1182
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:42,280
'She has to make her own decisions,
Right or wrong'...

1183
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:44,600
'Had I been there,
this is what I'd say.'

1184
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:00,760
He is doing mamma uh, mamma uh...

1185
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:02,640
Oh God, you guys think he'll
remember this?

1186
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:03,880
Of course.

1187
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:06,320
His mother throwing
up like the exorcist...

1188
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:07,600
Poor thing must be in trauma.

1189
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:09,800
This is gonna take
years of therapy.

1190
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:15,480
Meera relax, he's two years old.

1191
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:24,840
Shut up.

1192
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,080
Yes, Rishabh?

1193
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,280
Where is Kalandi?
- Kalindi?...

1194
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,880
Must be in her room.

1195
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:32,400
Her phone is switched off.

1196
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:35,080
Yesterday after the accident...
- What?

1197
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:38,080
What accident?
- Never mind.

1198
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,520
Please check her room.
I'm coming over. - What?

1199
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,640
What accident? One second.

1200
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:06,200
Oh no God!

1201
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:07,680
Oh you waked.

1202
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:14,600
Good morning, beautiful.

1203
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:16,720
Oh God!

1204
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:18,200
Oh no God!

1205
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:35,880
Hello, Inspector?

1206
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,440
Want to file a
missing person's report.

1207
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,520
This is Kshitij Puri
Since last night.

1208
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:45,280
I'll hold. Yes, I'll hold.

1209
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:48,920
God! Poor child.
Wonder where she is.

1210
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:50,840
What the *** hell!

1211
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:52,600
There were like
a 1000 people there.

1212
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:55,920
Someone must have seen her while
stuffing their faces with pasta.

1213
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:59,960
Maybe we should start calling
up the public and making inquiries?

1214
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:02,200
Smile please.

1215
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:04,840
Oh, my God!

1216
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:09,080
I think we burnt a
lot of calories last night.

1217
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:18,480
I didn't want to kill my own game
so I didn't say anything.

1218
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:21,360
What happened to your nincompoop?
- Nirmu?

1219
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:23,200
I mean Nirmal?

1220
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:26,160
He had to leave.
- How sweet of him.

1221
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:29,200
Any chance,
there's time for another round?

1222
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:34,320
Consider it morning cardio.

1223
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:43,080
Santosh Aunty?

1224
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,120
Is she your...
- Mom.

1225
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:48,840
God!

1226
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:57,880
Hey... at least
give me your number!

1227
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:02,320
Should we check the hospitals?

1228
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:07,360
God! Poor child.
Wonder where she is!

1229
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,760
Her rash should've
been my first clue.

1230
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:12,680
This is all my fault, guys.
I'm really sorry.

1231
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:15,880
Rishabh, this is not your fault.

1232
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:19,680
Keshav, I was fighting
on behalf of Kalindi.

1233
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:21,560
Excuse me.

1234
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:37,080
Good morning.
- Listen...

1235
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:39,400
Did you see Kalindi
after the ring ceremony?

1236
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,800
Er... I...

1237
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:45,960
I... I didn't make it
for the ring ceremony.

1238
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:48,160
Sorry.

1239
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:50,440
Great.

1240
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:52,760
They won't file
a missing person's report

1241
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:55,000
before 24 hours.
- Excuse me.

1242
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:07,320
Well, well, well.

1243
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:10,160
May we ask where
madam is coming from?

1244
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:12,000
I don't wanna talk about it.

1245
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,240
Nirmu?

1246
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:17,160
No, not that one.

1247
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:18,600
Bhandari.

1248
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:20,880
I don't even know his first name.

1249
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:23,320
What's wrong with me?

1250
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:27,440
By the way,
you know who his mother is, right?

1251
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:33,560
So, we'll get you
married on a moon as well...

1252
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:35,200
In a gown.

1253
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:38,280
Just like a fairy princess.
- You are...

1254
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:39,640
I mean the bride has run away...

1255
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:41,560
Why don't you get married instead?
Won't that be great?

1256
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:43,120
Such a good friend you are.

1257
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:45,800
Bro...

1258
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,640
I know where Kalindi is.

1259
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:51,920
Cookie Uncle!

1260
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:56,840
Are you okay.

1261
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:18,000
Dad taught me how to ride a bike...

1262
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:21,120
On that road.

1263
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:24,280
We didn't have much
traffic back then.

1264
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,600
And under that tree,
in winters, mom used to set up...

1265
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:29,400
a full-on breakfast table.

1266
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:32,840
Although I think dad and Cookie
Uncle used it more like a bar.

1267
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:41,440
Sometimes I feel that Dad and
I were connected only through mom.

1268
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:47,120
Mom gone relationship gone.

1269
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,400
Baby...

1270
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:57,720
I'm really sorry for
saying those things to you.

1271
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:01,040
I didn't mean to.
- I know.

1272
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:05,160
But you were right.

1273
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,360
I don't have a family.

1274
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:10,400
Don't say that Kaloo.

1275
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:11,720
No, it's true.

1276
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:14,440
Maybe that's why I don't
believe in all this.

1277
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:17,480
But you know what...

1278
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:20,000
I tried really hard.

1279
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:22,600
I swear.
- I know, I know.

1280
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:26,600
Did I ever force
you to do any of this?

1281
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,800
But family,
relationships, relatives...

1282
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:37,840
are so important to your family.

1283
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:40,520
And to you.

1284
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:44,040
I don't think I can
fulfill these expectations.

1285
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,000
Please don't hate me.

1286
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:13,240
We came this close, huh?

1287
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:22,760
They're coming, together.

1288
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:24,280
Oh god that's a relief.

1289
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:25,640
Yes, thank God.

1290
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:29,080
They looks good together.

1291
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:44,240
Where's Rishabh off to? All good?

1292
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:47,360
It's over.

1293
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:49,320
What do you mean "over"?
- What?

1294
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:51,720
What happened?

1295
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,600
Everything was going so well.

1296
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,440
I can't do this.
- What do you mean?

1297
01:11:58,400 --> 01:11:59,280
He's such a nice guy.

1298
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:01,120
You guys have been
together for so long.

1299
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:03,880
Kalindi...

1300
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,920
Don't tell me you're breaking
up with him because of his family.

1301
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:11,400
You know sometimes,
I can't understand you.

1302
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:12,800
What're you thinking man...

1303
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:13,800
Why are you doing this?

1304
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:16,480
Because not everyone is as
desperate as you to get married.

1305
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:19,480
Why're you lashing out at her?

1306
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:20,920
This is all your fault.

1307
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,000
My fault?

1308
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:23,720
Just look at yourself Sakshi.

1309
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:26,200
Have you ever used your
head to make any decision in life.

1310
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:28,440
No, I haven't.
- Kaloo.

1311
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:31,320
At least I don't run away
from stuff like you do.

1312
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:33,320
Grow some *** balls, Kalindi.

1313
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:36,640
No need to overanalyze
everything in life, Kalindi.

1314
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:39,520
Really? You're saying that to me?

1315
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:43,240
Listen guys...
enough with this *** fight.

1316
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:46,160
Let's go home, have a couple
of drinks and talk about this.

1317
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:48,640
Why? Didn't you have
enough last night?

1318
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:50,840
Excuse me?
- Anyway... thanks guys.

1319
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:53,040
For being the most
supportive friends in the world.

1320
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:55,520
Because last night, you
didn't leave my side for a second.

1321
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:57,360
Oh boohoo, Kalindi.

1322
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:59,800
Stop thinking about
yourself for two minutes...

1323
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:01,760
Some of us have real problems.

1324
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:02,960
Real problems?

1325
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:04,600
20 million on engagement
50 on the wedding.

1326
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:06,000
That's not a ***
real problem, Sakshi!

1327
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:07,080
That's it! I am going to slap her!
- Kaloo... just calm down.

1328
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:10,680
Kalindi,
drop this damsel-in-distress act.

1329
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:14,160
You're not the first or the last
girl in the world to get married.

1330
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:15,440
Yeah, I know.

1331
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:18,880
But I'm definitely the first to
do it without my *** friends.

1332
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:21,920
Come on Kaloo, please!
- Go! Run back to Australia.

1333
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,400
What else can we expect from you?

1334
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:25,680
- Just shut up guys, please.
- Go *** yourself.

1335
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:27,240
I've had enough of her nonsense.

1336
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:29,120
***!

1337
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:31,920
***!

1338
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,200
Stupid.

1339
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:39,200
God! We're ***.

1340
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:49,920
Shishu, at least tell us
what happened.

1341
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:53,720
I told you.

1342
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:55,200
I don't want to marry.

1343
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:56,960
Great.

1344
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:00,760
After spending millions, he says...

1345
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:02,200
he doesn't want to get married.

1346
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:03,520
You stay out of it.

1347
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,200
Come on tell mamma.

1348
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:06,480
Did you have a fight
with Kalindi?

1349
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:10,840
Hey... fight?
Who doesn't fight in a marriage?

1350
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:13,640
Son, fights are the foundation
marriages are built on.

1351
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:15,760
Try to understand, son...

1352
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:19,040
the invitations have
been offered to the gods, Huh?

1353
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:22,600
Oh God...
- Sorry.

1354
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:24,840
Yeah?

1355
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:26,640
Sir a police officer is
here to meet you.

1356
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:30,440
Ask him to wait.
- Okay, sir.

1357
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:36,760
What do you mean you
don't wanna marry?

1358
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:40,240
Your entire gang is
completely insane.

1359
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,120
One eloped to get married...

1360
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:43,560
The other is getting divorced.

1361
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:46,240
And the third one called
off a perfect wedding.

1362
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:50,040
I'm sure they are the ones
who influenced you against Nirmal.

1363
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:52,920
Can you please stop bitching
about my friends.

1364
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:54,880
You're always poking
your nose into my life.

1365
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:57,440
At least stay out of theirs.

1366
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:00,560
I mean...
Nirmal is such a nice boy.

1367
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:03,560
Well-educated, smart...

1368
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:07,040
But his CV fails to mention
that he's an ***.

1369
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:10,520
God, mom.
- Language.

1370
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:28,240
"We had soared,
only to fall down."

1371
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:38,120
"Yet we drowned our
sorrows with a smile."

1372
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:42,360
"We know everyrthing."

1373
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:50,200
"It's a punishment
for the miunderstanding."

1374
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:52,040
Have you seen Sakshi's message?

1375
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:53,240
On the group.

1376
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:59,560
Oh, my God!
- As they say, when fate *** you

1377
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:01,400
its usually up the ***.

1378
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:06,160
And these past few days,
we've been getting humped and how.

1379
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:09,960
At least we were together.

1380
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:12,840
So what if the wedding
is called off?

1381
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:15,160
We can still enjoy the honeymoon.

1382
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:17,200
What the ***!

1383
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:22,360
Before we get back
to our *** lives again.

1384
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:26,480
I want to spend a few days...
with my bros.

1385
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:31,680
And so... Swadikaa, ***!

1386
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:35,760
'Cos we're going to Phuket!

1387
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,640
Is she mad?
- Obviously.

1388
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:38,960
It's Sakshi Soni.

1389
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:41,680
She can't find peace without
blowing up daddy's money.

1390
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:44,320
Remember the whole baking phase?

1391
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:46,200
"Papa, papa, I wanna go to Paris."

1392
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:48,200
Like Delhi just doesn't cut it.

1393
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:57,040
"Brothers,
we'll walk a new path together."

1394
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:04,000
"Brothers,
we'll make a new life together."

1395
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:10,840
"Brothers,
we'll walk a new path together."

1396
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:18,600
"Brothers,
we'll make a new life together."

1397
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:22,400
'The person you are trying
to reach is currently unavailable.'

1398
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,400
Are you coming out or
should I come in?

1399
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:27,680
Coming!
- Come on.

1400
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:30,440
Are you crazy!
- You're hot, man!

1401
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:31,480
Oh my God.
- So sexy!

1402
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:34,280
Take it off!
Everyone's naked in Thailand.

1403
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:39,040
"Everyone's life is messy."

1404
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:42,440
"So live your dreams
don't be fussy."

1405
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:46,720
"It's time to seize
the moment, buddy."

1406
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:52,840
"Our friendship's
deep as it can be."

1407
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:56,320
"Bro, I guess we came
even compete with the sea."

1408
01:17:56,400 --> 01:18:00,200
"I'll always feel assured
when you are with me."

1409
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:06,400
"Intentions as weird
as they can be."

1410
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:10,000
"As wild as you and me."

1411
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:11,760
"Now don't be a cry baby."

1412
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:17,080
"As long as you have your
friends to give you company."

1413
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:23,480
"Brothers,
we'll walk a new path together."

1414
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:30,400
"Brothers,
we'll make a new life together."

1415
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:34,760
I love him.

1416
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:36,240
Carefully.

1417
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:39,160
Kaloo, I'm eating your share.
- Yes.

1418
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:47,720
You want boom boom?

1419
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:50,560
I know,
I know you want boom boom?

1420
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:51,960
Yeah, yeah, she wants.

1421
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:53,640
Come back, come back.

1422
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:55,080
It's written all over your face.

1423
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:57,880
I heard someone went all boom
boom at the dance function.

1424
01:18:57,960 --> 01:18:59,960
What? You slept with him?

1425
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:03,440
And that too at
Santosh Aunty's house? - Yuck!

1426
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:07,040
You were right, Kalindi.
I have become so desperate.

1427
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:09,120
And for what
to become someone's wife.

1428
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:12,520
I mean no matter how much you
study, graduation, post graduation.

1429
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:14,280
Even if you buy
your own house... car.

1430
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:18,840
But you've achieved nothing until
you become someone's goddamn wife.

1431
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:21,760
Twenty-first century,
my ***.

1432
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,280
Avni, language.

1433
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:25,520
I mean you've come of age,
get married.

1434
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,440
You're married, have a kid.

1435
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:29,680
Oh you've got one, have another.

1436
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:30,880
What is this pressure, man?

1437
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:32,560
How are people doing this?

1438
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,400
I've lost my mind.

1439
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:37,880
I can't believe I slept
with that shady Bhandari!

1440
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:39,960
You know he's a shopkeeper, dude?

1441
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:42,560
I'm pretty sure he hasn't
even graduated from high school.

1442
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:45,800
Okay, so now one needs
a degree to bang you?

1443
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:49,080
So sick, man...
you know what I mean.

1444
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:51,640
Okay, fine. But as it turns out,
the boy is rather generous.

1445
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:53,240
How?

1446
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:56,920
Apparently, madam took a trip to
Pleasure Peak that night.

1447
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,440
Multiple trips, dude.
- That's great.

1448
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:00,320
Oh multiple.
- Oh multiple.

1449
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,640
That's lovely bro.

1450
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:07,960
"Brothers,
we'll walk a new path together."

1451
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:15,640
"Brothers,
we'll make a new life together."

1452
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:19,840
Sakshi Soni.

1453
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:23,840
By sponsoring Air
India business class trips,

1454
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,560
do you realize
you're spoiling us?

1455
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:27,480
Nice flight, uh?

1456
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:29,760
Always on time.

1457
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:35,520
"What happened,
why it happened, forget it."

1458
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:37,560
"Just forget it."

1459
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:44,520
"All these are things
are pointless, meaningless."

1460
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:51,440
"With open arms you
should welcome happiness."

1461
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:54,360
"This is what life is."

1462
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:58,240
"A little bitter,
a little sweet, regardless."

1463
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:00,040
Bhandu...

1464
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:01,320
Bhandu...

1465
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:03,360
Shag me now, Bhandu!

1466
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:05,600
Sakshi Soni, I will kill you.

1467
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:07,280
You should be happy, ***.

1468
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:08,680
At least you're getting some.

1469
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:11,400
Pleasure Peak is the damn
reason I'm getting divorced.

1470
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:18,840
Okay guys, I was wrong.
You were right.

1471
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:20,840
I shouldn't have
rushed into marriage.

1472
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:22,760
Vineet was quite shady.

1473
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:24,760
We barely knew each other.

1474
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:26,000
And by the time we did,

1475
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:28,680
we realized we don't
like each other very much.

1476
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:32,160
So basically epic fights.

1477
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:35,080
Instead of sitting on your ass
the whole day,

1478
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:37,240
why don't you get
a *** job, Sakshi?

1479
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:39,280
I haven't got a *** job

1480
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:42,920
because I'm too busy cooking
for you everday!

1481
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,320
Just a second.

1482
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:45,920
Neha, I'll call you.

1483
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:50,640
Sakshi! Sakshi... how dare you?

1484
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:52,360
Sakshi, open the door!

1485
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,880
Hmm... thanks.
- Not bad.

1486
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:57,600
Vineet, you coming?
- Yeah.

1487
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:01,840
Sakshi, my work friends are here.
- Yes.

1488
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:04,120
Can you look a little presentable!?

1489
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:06,280
You're looking worse than a maid.

1490
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,520
Obviously,
it affected our sex life.

1491
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,640
I mean... zero.

1492
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:15,880
So basically, he cheated on you?
- No!

1493
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:19,920
One day after an epic fight
like below the belt,

1494
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,240
I told him I'm
going back to India.

1495
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:25,200
So, he came home
early from work.

1496
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:26,440
Sakshi...

1497
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:28,800
You cheated on him.

1498
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:30,560
Not technically.

1499
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:55,400
You're home early today?

1500
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:02,600
What?

1501
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:06,280
You mean like...

1502
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,000
Ménage à moi?

1503
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:10,280
So basically, after the fight
you were like I'm bored

1504
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:11,480
there's nothing better to do.

1505
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:14,000
So you know what,
let me jerk off.

1506
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:15,880
It had been three months, dude!

1507
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,960
And honestly I think the fight

1508
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:19,840
turned me on a little.

1509
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:22,600
Do your parents know?
- Are you nuts?

1510
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:23,960
How can I share "this"?

1511
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:26,280
Delhi aunties are
already hounding me.

1512
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:28,160
If this is out,
I'll be declared a porn star.

1513
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:30,400
Hello, have you ever
been to a family court?

1514
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:31,400
It gets very ugly.

1515
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:33,480
That's why I think I should give
into that *** demands

1516
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:34,720
and put an end to this nuisance.

1517
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:37,760
Is he blackmailing you?

1518
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:39,240
I guess, kind of.

1519
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:40,400
How much?

1520
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:43,720
Five?

1521
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:44,960
Hundred thousand?

1522
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:46,880
Million!

1523
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:49,400
Your bill.

1524
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:51,040
You want money?

1525
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:52,960
Let's spilt it.

1526
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:54,640
Give it to me.

1527
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:56,880
You pauper.
- You pay, Kalindi.

1528
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:04,840
Sakshi Soni, listen to me now,
cause last time you had not.

1529
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:09,080
If you give even a single
penny to that *** Vineet...

1530
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:10,560
I'll be your worst enemy.

1531
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:13,400
Sign the divorce papers.

1532
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:17,000
Settlement...

1533
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:18,680
I'll settle him.

1534
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:20,640
Nobody calls my best friend a maid.

1535
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:22,520
***.

1536
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:27,200
Vineet turned out to
be worse than expected.

1537
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:29,680
Not everyone is as lucky as you,
***.

1538
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:39,000
I haven't had sex in a year.

1539
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:44,200
What?
- Drought famine.

1540
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:47,320
But what about John's john...

1541
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:48,960
Lies.

1542
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:53,720
Obviously, I love my son.

1543
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:57,240
He's the apple of my eye,
my heart, my soul...

1544
01:24:57,360 --> 01:25:00,080
But that ***
came out... this big.

1545
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:02,880
And he was stuck in
there for like 12 hours.

1546
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,320
Like really stuck in there...

1547
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:06,120
You know then they have to
take the suction pump and then...

1548
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:08,840
Meera, please please please!
Please!

1549
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:10,480
I want to have children some day.

1550
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:11,520
Then you should know this.

1551
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:13,120
No, I don't want to know this.

1552
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:17,160
On top of that,
I look like a cow.

1553
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:20,000
My poor John.

1554
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:21,960
Baby, you are still sexy.

1555
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:23,080
Thank you.

1556
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:25,240
Come on.

1557
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:27,160
Means what?
- Stop body shaming.

1558
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:30,320
No, you should eat.
Some more crab?

1559
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:32,200
Sakshi...
- Eat away.

1560
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:34,120
I'm not sharing. Nonsense.

1561
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:38,960
"Brothers,
we'll walk a new path together."

1562
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:41,680
Come on, Kaloo!

1563
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:47,000
"Brothers,
we'll make a new life together."

1564
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:53,800
"Brothers,
we'll walk a new path together."

1565
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:59,480
"Brothers,
we'll make a new life together."

1566
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:03,120
I can't help it.
But I miss you.

1567
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:13,720
Hey, you're back.

1568
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:48,600
Welcome back honey!

1569
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:50,160
How was the holiday?

1570
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:55,480
Can I talk to you
guys for a minute?

1571
01:26:56,720 --> 01:26:58,400
Hey, where is everybody?
- Hi!

1572
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:01,520
Hey, Kalindi! Yeah, the boy's
gonna be out till late tonight.

1573
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:03,440
- Hey babe.
- Hello!

1574
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:07,600
Hold me.

1575
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:09,640
Hello!

1576
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:10,880
Hello!

1577
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:15,040
I was furious so
I got a little drunk.

1578
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:19,440
At home, all alone I was sort
of using this instrument and...

1579
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:22,680
Ma...
- Hmm?

1580
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:25,240
I've always done whatever
you've asked of me.

1581
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:32,120
But this arranged marriage
stuff I just can't do it.

1582
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:36,000
I really tried.

1583
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:39,480
But I am what I am.

1584
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:41,960
I don't think I can change.

1585
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:48,360
I also am, what I am.

1586
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:50,800
I'll keep nagging you.

1587
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:52,600
Oh, my God.

1588
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:55,680
Oh, I love you old woman!

1589
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:57,880
Who the hell are you calling old!?

1590
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,040
Today I'll not leave you.

1591
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:04,400
Swadikaa.

1592
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:17,520
You're truly my daughter.

1593
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:21,480
Had you told me sooner,
I would've sorted him out.

1594
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:27,800
Good morning, Cookie Uncle.

1595
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:30,880
Ah, the runaway bride has returned.

1596
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:34,440
So?

1597
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:36,640
Have you spoken to Rishabh?

1598
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:38,360
No.

1599
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:41,040
Why?
- So you don't know?

1600
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:42,280
What?

1601
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:48,520
Your father-in-law
is making headlines.

1602
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:50,880
We got off easy.

1603
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:53,760
Bank fraud of 20 million.
- What do you mean?

1604
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:57,360
It means he's behind bars,
doing time.

1605
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:01,920
Rishabh!

1606
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,440
Tell me something, Uncle.

1607
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:31,720
Why were mom and dad together?

1608
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:34,760
Because of me, right?

1609
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:36,000
Of course not.

1610
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:38,000
They loved each other.

1611
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:40,680
And I can't think
of a better reason.

1612
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:44,200
Look, whatever they were,
however they were...

1613
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,440
they loved you a lot.

1614
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,400
I guess marriage
just isn't in my DNA.

1615
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:51,520
Hey.

1616
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:53,360
Why do you think that?

1617
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:58,160
You are neither crazy like your
mom nor stubborn like your dad.

1618
01:29:58,280 --> 01:30:00,360
Love and fights always
go hand-in-hand.

1619
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:02,640
I mean look at Keshav and I.

1620
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:07,080
Darling.

1621
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:10,280
Please don't base
your life's decisions...

1622
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:13,640
on the their
stupid mistakes.

1623
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:25,240
Rishabh!

1624
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:26,720
Are you okay?

1625
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:29,560
Now I am.

1626
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:32,800
Come.

1627
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:37,680
You must have some contacts, dude!

1628
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:51,640
Hi, Kaloo.

1629
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:53,800
***.

1630
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:56,200
What?

1631
01:30:56,840 --> 01:31:00,480
Can you at least
sneak in some booze.

1632
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:02,760
Someone has cast
an evil eye upon us.

1633
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:05,640
What have we ever done to anyone.

1634
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:08,480
That's what I fail to understand.

1635
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:11,600
Only a couple of bounced cheques
what's the big deal?

1636
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:15,080
Oh God!
Why are you doing this to us?

1637
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:17,880
Because God never asked
you to hire Russian dancers.

1638
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:20,240
I told you,
his bail has been issued.

1639
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:24,040
I don't understand what will you get
by keeping an old man behind bars.

1640
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:26,080
How can we let him go, madam?

1641
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:27,000
We have to follow the law.

1642
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:28,640
Don't try to teach me the law.

1643
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:29,720
This is the copy of it.

1644
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:31,160
You will soon get the original.

1645
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:33,520
You are harassing
the family for no reason.

1646
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:37,520
Well done, Tiger!
You totally devoured them!

1647
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:41,080
You are a force to reckon with.

1648
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:44,760
- So, I...
- I was wondering..

1649
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:46,320
Go ahead.

1650
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:49,600
I was trying to
say that whatever...

1651
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:51,600
Happened that night...

1652
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:53,400
Whatever happened that night...

1653
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:55,520
It wasn't me.

1654
01:31:55,640 --> 01:31:59,280
It was just me dealing
with some issues.

1655
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:02,680
Well I didn't mind at all.

1656
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:06,320
And you also looked quite pleased.

1657
01:32:08,840 --> 01:32:11,560
Oh well, you forgot
something at my place.

1658
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:12,960
I thought I should
keep it but then..

1659
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:14,160
Bhandari!

1660
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:17,080
Listen...
Listen! Listen! Listen!

1661
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:19,440
I have a "case" pending
since quite a few days.

1662
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:21,280
Help me, please?

1663
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:23,560
I help people get divorced.

1664
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:24,880
Are you married?

1665
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:27,760
Just waiting for you to say yes.

1666
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:28,840
Wait, wait, wait.

1667
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:32,320
Let me drop you home.

1668
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:34,600
I've booked an Uber.

1669
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,000
A loan of 20 million!

1670
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:48,760
A loan of 20 million!!

1671
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:52,680
Earlier I thought
only my mother is crazy.

1672
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:54,280
But my father..

1673
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:55,960
Food from Italy..

1674
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:58,080
He *** wants to feed
people Italian food!

1675
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:00,080
Even if he has to
eat the prison food.

1676
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:07,000
You know
you were absolutely right.

1677
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:09,400
Everything was just perfect.

1678
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:12,760
I *** up everything
by proposing to you.

1679
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:16,080
I really wish we could go back.

1680
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:20,200
Me too.

1681
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:27,680
When are you going back?

1682
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:29,880
Day after tomorrow.

1683
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:32,120
What about you?

1684
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:37,600
I don't think I'm
going back to Australia.

1685
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:47,480
Honestly, I don't know how long
It'll take me to sort all this out.

1686
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:50,120
Two years, five years.

1687
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:59,880
Luckily the house lease
is in your name so...

1688
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,560
you won't have
to face any problems.

1689
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:06,600
Get pest control
done after you go back.

1690
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:19,080
"Now that we have come together,
why don't you stay?"

1691
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:27,760
"A few promises fulfilled,
a few promises left to keep."

1692
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:29,480
"What can I say?"

1693
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:35,880
"A few dreams shall be fulfilled
and a few forever unfulfilled."

1694
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,280
"What can I say?"

1695
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:40,480
"Please come back."

1696
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:42,680
"Please come back."

1697
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:43,760
"Please come back."

1698
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:47,080
"You don't need to think so hard."

1699
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:49,240
"Please come back."

1700
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:51,400
"Please come back."

1701
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:52,520
"Please come back."

1702
01:34:52,640 --> 01:34:56,160
"You don't need to think so hard."

1703
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:20,640
"Let's dwell in each other's
hearts, even if only for a while."

1704
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:29,480
"Let's just live and
not bother about the trials."

1705
01:35:31,080 --> 01:35:39,760
"Let's recourse the wandered
promise to the right path."

1706
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:41,520
"Let's rekindle hope..."

1707
01:35:41,640 --> 01:35:43,360
Kalindi, your ticket...

1708
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:46,560
Where's Kalindi?

1709
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:48,560
She's gone to the house one
last time, before she leaves.

1710
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:50,720
"Please come back.."

1711
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:53,760
"Please come back.."

1712
01:35:53,880 --> 01:35:56,280
What a disastrous
non-wedding it is!

1713
01:35:56,760 --> 01:35:57,880
The groom's selling his house.

1714
01:35:57,960 --> 01:36:00,560
The bride's leaving her house,
so pathetic!

1715
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:04,880
"There will be many evenings
which will come to a standstill."

1716
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:09,280
"There will be many conversations
without any frills."

1717
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:11,560
"We'll act stubborn over
a small issue..."

1718
01:36:11,640 --> 01:36:17,640
"it'll be a long night
I understand."

1719
01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:20,280
"We'll still manage to
love each other in the end."

1720
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:21,560
Poor Kaloo.

1721
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:24,160
She's going back
in such bad shape.

1722
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:25,560
All alone!

1723
01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:28,360
Does her dad even
know what happened?

1724
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:31,720
Only if he could spare
time from philandering.

1725
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:34,200
I feel so helpless.

1726
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:37,120
I really miss Ritu Aunty.

1727
01:36:37,240 --> 01:36:38,840
Seriously, man.

1728
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,400
She had balls.

1729
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:43,760
None of this would happen,
if she were here.

1730
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:46,720
All the uncles, Malhotras..

1731
01:36:46,840 --> 01:36:49,400
She would have taught
them all a lesson!

1732
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:51,600
"You were right there.."

1733
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:56,960
"Yet you were unavailable
and I was missing."

1734
01:36:58,280 --> 01:37:05,320
"Now that we've come together,
why don't you stay?"

1735
01:37:11,640 --> 01:37:13,240
Where are you going?
- To teach them a lesson.

1736
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:14,600
Uncle!

1737
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:17,520
No, no, no!

1738
01:37:17,640 --> 01:37:20,600
I'll readily dance at the signal
with the lepers, naked.

1739
01:37:20,720 --> 01:37:23,040
But I will never
talk to that scoundrel.

1740
01:37:23,160 --> 01:37:24,160
Never!

1741
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:25,440
See!

1742
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:28,720
The smaller the brain
the bigger the ego!

1743
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:31,920
It's been four years.

1744
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:33,960
The only people benefiting
are the lawyers.

1745
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:35,720
And who is suffering?

1746
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:37,040
Kalindi.

1747
01:37:39,480 --> 01:37:40,480
Uncle!

1748
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:42,200
Are you listening to me?

1749
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:44,080
How can you be so selfish?

1750
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:46,640
After aunty passed away,
instead of supporting her

1751
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:48,160
all of you have started
throwing tantrums.

1752
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:49,240
I have always made Kaloo..

1753
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:52,280
And that day, during the function
you guys crossed all limits.

1754
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:55,640
In front of so many people,
you started fighting like loafers!

1755
01:37:59,080 --> 01:38:00,480
Come on, Uncle!

1756
01:38:01,160 --> 01:38:02,680
End this now.

1757
01:38:02,920 --> 01:38:04,280
Seriously, Cookie.

1758
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:06,680
Don't you understand
what Kalindi is going through?

1759
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:10,840
For a change, instead of yourself
think about her.

1760
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:13,840
Kalindi is going back tonight.

1761
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:17,480
Do you want her to never come back?

1762
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:20,280
Hello? Hi Krishna Uncle,
Sakshi here.

1763
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:23,320
Do you have a minute?
Good.

1764
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:25,880
Because Cookie Uncle
wants to talk to you.

1765
01:38:26,120 --> 01:38:27,120
One sec.

1766
01:38:28,240 --> 01:38:29,320
Come on, Uncle.

1767
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:32,600
Uncle!
- Come on.

1768
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:43,840
Yes, Krishna.

1769
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:58,000
You know I never understood

1770
01:38:58,720 --> 01:39:02,560
why did you have to vacate
the house after our fight.

1771
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:06,480
Honestly speaking...

1772
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:10,560
I wasn't angry at Paromita.

1773
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:14,280
I was angry because I felt that..

1774
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:17,880
Because of her.

1775
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:21,840
Kalindi left us.

1776
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:26,560
And you two left me.

1777
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:32,400
Cookie I've supported
all your choices and decisions.

1778
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:33,640
Always.

1779
01:39:37,040 --> 01:39:38,480
I'm sorry, bro.

1780
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:46,640
What's this?

1781
01:39:52,160 --> 01:39:54,000
Property papers of Shanti Niwas.

1782
01:39:54,120 --> 01:39:55,440
Is this your idea?

1783
01:39:57,320 --> 01:40:02,160
Ever since childhood, have
you done anything in moderation?

1784
01:40:05,240 --> 01:40:06,680
Crazy fool.

1785
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:07,720
Where's uncle?

1786
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:10,000
I'll miss my damn flight!

1787
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Uncle, I thought you forgot!
- Sorry, kiddo.

1788
01:40:13,120 --> 01:40:16,040
There was something pending that
I should've taken care of long ago.

1789
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:21,120
Papa?

1790
01:40:27,640 --> 01:40:28,880
What's going on?

1791
01:40:29,080 --> 01:40:30,560
The epic battle is over!

1792
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:33,040
No more villains.

1793
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:42,000
My dear, I can't bring back
the time lost.

1794
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:46,080
But I can at least try
to make our future better.

1795
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:47,960
Cookie.

1796
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:50,480
Our gift to you.

1797
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:01,680
Papers of the house?

1798
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:02,960
Uncle..

1799
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:08,040
I can't take this.

1800
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:10,120
The house always was

1801
01:41:10,240 --> 01:41:11,440
and is, yours.

1802
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:22,800
I really missed you.

1803
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:31,280
You know...

1804
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:34,200
whenever Ritu and I used to fight

1805
01:41:34,640 --> 01:41:36,280
she used to go and paint.

1806
01:41:38,720 --> 01:41:42,800
That's why it looked more
of a museum than a house.

1807
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:46,120
True.

1808
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:49,800
We fought a lot, didn't we?

1809
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:54,200
Like cats and dogs.

1810
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:56,400
Really?

1811
01:41:57,400 --> 01:42:00,160
Whatever we were,
however we were...

1812
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:01,960
we were family.

1813
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:08,000
I've made a lot of mistakes.

1814
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:11,400
Being angry, being stubborn.

1815
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:20,080
Maybe I'm just as stubborn.

1816
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:21,640
Maybe.

1817
01:42:22,440 --> 01:42:24,920
But you are smarter than me,
Kalindi.

1818
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:28,120
I'm sure you'll
take the right decision.

1819
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:38,760
Rishabh is a very nice guy.

1820
01:42:39,640 --> 01:42:41,600
Your mummy would have loved him.

1821
01:42:58,640 --> 01:42:59,800
You're back.

1822
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:01,160
No, still on the way.

1823
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:03,560
Lawyer sent these papers for you
to sign and send them back.

1824
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:04,680
Here.

1825
01:43:05,160 --> 01:43:06,120
Mohan, get me food.

1826
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:07,560
Shishu?

1827
01:43:07,680 --> 01:43:08,760
Why are you eating downstairs?

1828
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:09,760
You should go and eat upstairs.

1829
01:43:09,880 --> 01:43:11,960
You are the one who insists
on eating in the dining room.

1830
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:13,920
Hey, don't argue just go.

1831
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:15,560
Shishu, listen..

1832
01:43:15,680 --> 01:43:17,640
I had asked the priest
to pray specially.

1833
01:43:17,960 --> 01:43:19,160
Have the offering.

1834
01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:20,800
Everything will be fine.

1835
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:23,160
Okay?
Go now. Go!

1836
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:26,400
Everything's okay!

1837
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:52,720
Hi!

1838
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:06,720
Hi Kaloo.

1839
01:44:09,320 --> 01:44:10,240
Look!

1840
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:13,040
It's still very scary for me...

1841
01:44:13,960 --> 01:44:15,560
but I still want to do it.

1842
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:20,280
'Cause not doing
it is even scarier.

1843
01:44:25,320 --> 01:44:26,560
Rishabh Malhotra...

1844
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:28,960
will you marry me?

1845
01:44:34,040 --> 01:44:35,600
Oh God!

1846
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:39,200
Just a minute.
Baby, I'll be right back.

1847
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:03,960
Is it too late, Rishabh?

1848
01:45:05,080 --> 01:45:06,920
I had gone looking for our ring.

1849
01:45:12,360 --> 01:45:14,560
Baby, this all this...

1850
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:17,360
it's not going to be easy.

1851
01:45:18,640 --> 01:45:20,080
Family never is!

1852
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:30,360
Sarita!

1853
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:32,160
There they are!

1854
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:22,320
Going to be bride,
show us your beautiful face!!

1855
01:46:23,560 --> 01:46:24,560
Wow.

1856
01:46:26,240 --> 01:46:27,120
Kaloo!

1857
01:46:27,240 --> 01:46:29,120
Looking so beautiful.
- Looking so gorgeous.

1858
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:44,040
What's your name, son?

1859
01:46:44,160 --> 01:46:45,840
Kabir Singh Stinson.

1860
01:46:46,040 --> 01:46:46,920
What's your name?

1861
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:49,120
Hey, my name is also Kabir Singh.

1862
01:46:52,280 --> 01:46:54,120
Okay, I've brought
something for all of you.

1863
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:55,800
What?
- Something small.

1864
01:46:56,800 --> 01:47:00,560
Mom had four of these,
I think each of us should keep one.

1865
01:47:00,640 --> 01:47:01,680
But..

1866
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:04,560
Kalindi, how can we..

1867
01:47:04,640 --> 01:47:06,360
She would've wanted us to have it.

1868
01:47:08,640 --> 01:47:09,760
It's beautiful.

1869
01:47:21,640 --> 01:47:25,480
Welcome, welcome!

1870
01:47:26,040 --> 01:47:28,320
Welcome.
- I'll have to attend this call.

1871
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:41,280
Badé Papa!

1872
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:48,160
You look just like Ritu!

1873
01:47:51,080 --> 01:47:52,400
Papa!

1874
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:54,720
You know the tailor
had made this skirt,

1875
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:56,560
two inches longer.

1876
01:47:57,160 --> 01:47:59,800
Ritu kept tripping on it.

1877
01:48:03,800 --> 01:48:07,120
I couldn't understand
a thing when she left us.

1878
01:48:07,640 --> 01:48:10,000
What should I do?
Where should I go?

1879
01:48:13,960 --> 01:48:15,640
And I'm really sorry my dear..

1880
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:19,280
I left you all alone
after she passed away.

1881
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:20,600
I'm really sorry.

1882
01:48:24,120 --> 01:48:25,600
I was never alone, Papa.

1883
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:29,040
Where are you going?
- There is your car.

1884
01:48:31,400 --> 01:48:33,240
Damn... damn.

1885
01:48:36,160 --> 01:48:38,640
I called him. He was happy to come.

1886
01:48:55,720 --> 01:48:57,560
Hi, Aunty. Hello, Aunty.

1887
01:48:57,640 --> 01:48:58,920
You're looking nice.
- Hello, Aunty.

1888
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:00,440
Nice dress.

1889
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:04,240
I thought I should share
the good news with you personally.

1890
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:06,600
Actually,
my divorce just got finalized.

1891
01:49:06,680 --> 01:49:12,160
You see, my dog of a husband
caught me *** myself.

1892
01:49:12,240 --> 01:49:14,720
You know, right? Self-service?

1893
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
And by the way, as we are
on the topic of sex and drugs..

1894
01:49:17,080 --> 01:49:19,200
Aunty, I should tell
you that your son.

1895
01:49:19,280 --> 01:49:21,800
Is the most famous
coke dealer of Green Park.

1896
01:49:21,880 --> 01:49:25,160
And his biggest client
is your daughter Aunty.

1897
01:49:25,240 --> 01:49:28,400
And they are also having an affair.

1898
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:31,280
Can't help it.
Coke's too expensive these days.

1899
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:34,520
Anyway, who cares!

1900
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:49,880
You didn't want to write my name?

1901
01:49:50,160 --> 01:49:51,360
Hi, Bhandari.

1902
01:49:51,440 --> 01:49:53,120
Hello, beautiful.

1903
01:49:55,680 --> 01:49:58,400
You know,
I dreamed about you last night.

1904
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:01,320
Did I have my clothes on?
- Unfortunately yes.

1905
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:04,560
Bye, Bhandari.
- Listen.

1906
01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:05,640
See you downstairs.

1907
01:50:05,720 --> 01:50:08,360
What about your mobile number?
- Didn't get it in your dreams?

1908
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:19,000
'Kalandi and her weird
and eccentric Bros...'

1909
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:21,120
have made it so far.

1910
01:50:21,200 --> 01:50:24,760
'They had each other's back
They understood each other.'

1911
01:50:29,160 --> 01:50:32,160
'They will make mistakes.'

1912
01:50:32,400 --> 01:50:34,240
'And they will learn
from these mistakes.'

1913
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:36,240
'They will write
their own stories..'

1914
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:39,240
'which will be better than
fairytales that give false hope.'

1915
01:50:43,320 --> 01:50:45,960
'Their stories will
have a new twist every day.'

1916
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:49,280
'And they will have a
new happy ending every day.'

1917
01:50:51,200 --> 01:50:53,080
Hello?
- Hello, beautiful.

1918
01:50:53,160 --> 01:50:54,320
Bhandari..

1919
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:56,240
How did you get my number?

1920
01:50:56,320 --> 01:50:58,400
Where there is a
will there is a way...

1921
01:50:58,480 --> 01:51:00,080
I know it's a cliché.

1922
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:01,400
Look towards your right.

1923
01:51:01,480 --> 01:51:03,440
Your mom gave me your number.

1924
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:07,880
Listen, Bhandari.

1925
01:51:08,840 --> 01:51:10,600
I have no intentions
of getting married.

1926
01:51:10,680 --> 01:51:12,800
I'm not running behind
you with a ring either.

1927
01:51:13,440 --> 01:51:15,440
How about a date?

1928
01:51:17,480 --> 01:51:19,800
Fine, I'll think about it.
Call me tomorrow.

1929
01:51:19,880 --> 01:51:20,840
