00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:49,500
[chuckles softly]

352
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:52,875
Yeah. That's what friends do!
Don't you worry about that.

353
00:19:53,167 --> 00:19:55,542
So shall I take him to school as
soon as he arrives?

354
00:19:55,792 --> 00:19:56,917
[Jyothi] Of course!

355
00:19:57,042 --> 00:19:58,542
After all, he’s coming here for you.

356
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,042
Take him anywhere.

357
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,083
He and I have the rest
of our lives to talk.

358
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:03,333
[doorbell rings]

359
00:20:03,417 --> 00:20:04,625
Yay! Dad's here.

360
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,208
[imitates drums]

361
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,667
Raasu Kutti, has your father come?

362
00:20:19,792 --> 00:20:22,542
[Raasu Kutti] If he were here already,
why would I play you a drumroll?

363
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:25,417
[man 1] He’s definitely coming, kid.

364
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,417
-[man 2]<i> Hey, burly man! </i>
-[man 1]<i> How are you, angry man?</i>

365
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,625
-[man 2]<i> I’m good. </i>
-[woman 4]<i> Welcome, bro!</i>

366
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:31,458
<i>-[man 1] Broke your arm in a fight?
-[old woman 3] Welcome, Sister-in-law!</i>

367
00:20:31,542 --> 00:20:32,917
<i>-[woman 4] Jyothi.
-[man 2] It was only a small quarrel.</i>

368
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,333
<i>-[man 1] You look hot!
-[woman 4] Take care, man.</i>

369
00:20:34,417 --> 00:20:36,500
[clock chimes]

370
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,833
<i>[man 2] Girl, you're taller
than your dad now.</i>

371
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,333
[girl] That was so last year, Uncle.

372
00:20:42,042 --> 00:20:44,500
[man 1] So Manickam's been gone
for six years?

373
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:45,958
[Jyothi] No. Seven and a half years.

374
00:20:46,042 --> 00:20:48,625
[man 1] At last, spring is here.
After seven long winters.

375
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:54,500
It's all astrological effects, I know...

376
00:20:54,792 --> 00:20:55,833
[Jyothi] Go have a bath.

377
00:20:55,917 --> 00:20:57,875
[water splashing]

378
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,250
What do you think, Malar?

379
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,750
He may have abandoned his
family like Siddhartha...

380
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,542
but he is not coming back as Buddha!

381
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:05,833
Just wait and see,

382
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:08,417
he's going to come back
with a northie wife!

383
00:21:08,542 --> 00:21:11,292
Jyothi’s face is going
to be a sight to behold.

384
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:13,458
I swear on my coffee!

385
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:15,542
Hey!

386
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,708
[dramatic music]

387
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,292
[dramatic music continues]

388
00:21:48,042 --> 00:21:50,333
[Raasu Kutti] Shall I check
at the railway station?

389
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:54,417
[Grandma] Like a crow is going
to carry him away! Go eat!

390
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:56,750
[Raasu Kutti] No, I’ll eat with dad.

391
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:57,750
[Grandma] Mm-mm!

392
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:02,583
[Jyothi] Don't stay hungry, sweetie.
You can eat with him from tomorrow on.

393
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:04,667
[indistinct chatter]

394
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:07,750
-When is Sekar getting married?
-We are looking...

395
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:09,167
He's not at all...

396
00:22:09,917 --> 00:22:12,625
[dramatic music]

397
00:22:12,917 --> 00:22:15,625
[woman 4] Sister-in-law,
please have a few more idlis.

398
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:18,875
[man 1] Koushik! The taxi is coming!

399
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:20,625
-[Raasu Kutti] Wow!
-[woman 4] Come, everyone!

400
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:22,667
-[Raasu Kutti] Out of my way!
-[woman 5] Come, everyone!

401
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,833
[Raasu Kutti] Someone give me some water
to wash my hands!

402
00:22:24,917 --> 00:22:27,417
Where's the washbasin when you need it?

403
00:22:28,917 --> 00:22:30,917
[light music]

404
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:40,833
[light music continues]

405
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:46,750
[Raasu Kutti] Hey, wait up... wait up!

406
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:50,250
[grunts]

407
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:52,083
[Man 1] Who built these stairs so steep?

408
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:00,958
Fuck!

409
00:23:08,417 --> 00:23:10,417
[joyful music continues]

410
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:19,750
-[woman 4] I can't believe my eyes!
-[woman 5] What the hell is this?

411
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,792
[man 1] <i>Oh, my god!</i>

412
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:36,167
[woman 4] Has he gone mad or what?

413
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:40,583
[Ramasamy] <i>Arputham! Arputham!</i>

414
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:42,833
Arputham! Arputham!

415
00:23:42,917 --> 00:23:44,833
[Arputham] Ramasamy,
I won’t pray for anyone.

416
00:23:45,292 --> 00:23:46,417
My heart is clouded by doubt.

417
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,542
Doubt is Satan’s master key.

418
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:51,042
Satan rides the chariot of doubt.

419
00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:53,125
[Arputham] I'm losing my faith, Ramasamy.

420
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:56,792
-Faith alone is the anchor of God.
-[Arputham] Oh, no!

421
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:59,917
Fear not. Believe. Fear not. Believe.

422
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:01,792
[Arputham] Don’t throw my own
sermons back at me.

423
00:24:02,042 --> 00:24:02,917
Leave...

424
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:08,125
[Ramasamy] They’re all waiting, Arputham.

425
00:24:08,292 --> 00:24:09,667
Pray for them.

426
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:11,792
Come and save them.

427
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:13,833
Aren’t you the right hand of God?

428
00:24:14,042 --> 00:24:16,792
[Arputham] I won’t pray for
or save anyone, Ramasamy. Leave me.

429
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:30,958
[ocean waves crashing]

430
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:41,958
About a decade ago,

431
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:44,125
there was a heartbroken man

432
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:45,958
who gave up on life,

433
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:48,958
walked into the sea to drown himself.

434
00:24:49,708 --> 00:24:53,458
But as he walked in,
the sea began to pull back.

435
00:24:53,917 --> 00:24:55,708
He was stunned.

436
00:24:56,042 --> 00:24:59,833
Suddenly, the sea reared up
and returned as a monstrous wave.

437
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:03,292
He had never seen anything like it.

438
00:25:03,542 --> 00:25:05,458
It was a tsunami.

439
00:25:06,917 --> 00:25:09,167
The sight of the waves terrified him.

440
00:25:09,667 --> 00:25:12,042
Triggering his survival instincts,

441
00:25:12,667 --> 00:25:13,750
he fled.

442
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:17,333
The waves caught up to him. He went under.

443
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:21,458
At that moment, his hands
grabbed something,

444
00:25:21,583 --> 00:25:23,458
and he held on tightly.

445
00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:26,167
The water engulfed him.

446
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,958
The sea strived to pull
him into its depths,

447
00:25:29,417 --> 00:25:33,208
but he never let go
of what he was holding.

448
00:25:33,542 --> 00:25:36,583
Finally, the sea grew calm.

449
00:25:38,542 --> 00:25:42,125
[Ramasamy] He regained his consciousness,

450
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:48,250
and then realized that
he'd been clutching...

451
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,500
our Tsunami God!

452
00:25:53,583 --> 00:25:57,417
God wiped out the millions
who wanted to live,

453
00:25:57,583 --> 00:26:01,833
and spared the only one who wanted to die.

454
00:26:02,292 --> 00:26:03,958
He reflected on the irony.

455
00:26:04,375 --> 00:26:07,500
[Ramasamy] He then renounced his old self,

456
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:10,750
as a testament to God's miracle.

457
00:26:10,958 --> 00:26:14,583
He renamed himself Arputham.

458
00:26:15,125 --> 00:26:18,208
[Ramasamy] He began saving the dying
and the diseased,

459
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:23,375
by pleading and doggedly requesting
to God.

460
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:26,000
Eventually, he became
the right hand of God.

461
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:28,292
-I bear witness.
-I bear witness.

462
00:26:28,625 --> 00:26:30,417
Six months ago,

463
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,875
I was unable to speak.

464
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:34,500
But now I can.

465
00:26:34,792 --> 00:26:38,375
It's all because Arputham prayed for me.

466
00:26:38,458 --> 00:26:40,583
-I bear witness.
-I, too, bear witness.

467
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:42,375
Is Arputham a Christian?

468
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:46,167
Unlike what most believe,
he is not a Christian!

469
00:26:46,417 --> 00:26:48,708
His religion only has three elements:

470
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:50,750
his beloved Tsunami God,

471
00:26:51,125 --> 00:26:55,833
the book of his hymns
in praise of the Lord,

472
00:26:56,083 --> 00:27:00,042
and finally, the testament to the
Lord's miracle, Arputham himself.

473
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:03,500
He has not even initiated
me into his religion yet.

474
00:27:03,833 --> 00:27:04,708
I bear witness.

475
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:06,625
Damn, me too.

476
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:09,625
Just curious. What drove him to suicide?

477
00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:11,667
Don't weigh yourself down with cleverness.

478
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:15,375
Remember, while heavy objects sink,
the light ones stay afloat.

479
00:27:16,583 --> 00:27:18,667
[phone rings]

480
00:27:19,042 --> 00:27:21,625
Look at him questioning the Lord's ways!

481
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:25,292
Don't over-analyze the problems...

482
00:27:25,667 --> 00:27:27,042
[man 3] See the way he talks!

483
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:30,583
Accept that problems are the means
for God to reveal himself.

484
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:35,625
Throughout his turmoil, Arputham
tightly held on to God’s hand,

485
00:27:35,708 --> 00:27:37,583
and God has not let go
of his hand till now.

486
00:27:37,667 --> 00:27:44,333
His prayers alone have saved those
forsaken by doctors themselves.

487
00:27:44,542 --> 00:27:46,000
-I bear witness.
-I bear witness.

488
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:47,500
-[audience] I bear witness.
-I do, too.

489
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:49,167
[woman 6] Then why isn't he saving
my son now?

490
00:27:51,792 --> 00:27:53,667
[phone rings]

491
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:55,542
-Tsk!
-[phone beeps]

492
00:27:55,625 --> 00:27:56,458
Hello?

493
00:27:57,583 --> 00:27:58,458
Who’s this?

494
00:27:59,667 --> 00:28:00,833
Arputham! Arputham!

495
00:28:00,917 --> 00:28:02,292
Open the door! Its urgent!

496
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:05,333
Arputham! There's been an accident!

497
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:07,042
I will not pray for anyone.

498
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:10,000
Its an emergency! Just take the phone!

499
00:28:12,583 --> 00:28:13,458
Hello?

500
00:28:13,542 --> 00:28:16,167
[woman 7] <i>Dhanasekar!
Your son has had an accident!</i>

501
00:28:16,458 --> 00:28:19,333
-<i>A rod has pierced his gut! He’s critical!</i>
-[tense music]

502
00:28:19,458 --> 00:28:20,792
<i>Come fast!</i>

503
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:23,333
[tense music]

504
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:31,375
[panting]

505
00:28:38,042 --> 00:28:40,292
[groans]

506
00:28:45,417 --> 00:28:47,375
[tense music]

507
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:00,625
[sighs]

508
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,417
[tense music]

509
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:22,333
[Mani] Sir... Sir...

510
00:29:22,417 --> 00:29:23,958
-Mugil! Sir!
-[Mugil] Hm.

511
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,250
-Aren't you coming for the feast?
-Yes.

512
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:29,375
Sure. Let me get Vaembu, too.

513
00:29:29,792 --> 00:29:32,500
By the way, I have a small request.

514
00:29:32,958 --> 00:29:33,958
Sure.

515
00:29:34,458 --> 00:29:36,042
My house is overcrowded.

516
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:40,042
Can a few elders hang out at your place?

517
00:29:40,208 --> 00:29:41,708
-Sure. Send them up.
-Okay, sir.

518
00:29:41,958 --> 00:29:45,750
[whispering]
My wife's family, pricey folks.

519
00:29:45,833 --> 00:29:47,375
Tsk! Hmm!

520
00:29:49,042 --> 00:29:50,917
So when can we see you on the big screen?

521
00:29:51,292 --> 00:29:54,500
I just started my acting course.
There's plenty of time for that.

522
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:56,750
[Mani] Don’t forget us
when you make it big!

523
00:29:56,833 --> 00:29:58,208
Cheers to your optimism!

524
00:29:59,167 --> 00:30:00,292
[knocking on door]

525
00:30:04,708 --> 00:30:05,917
[door opens]

526
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:15,083
Hey!

527
00:30:15,167 --> 00:30:16,083
Hmm?

528
00:30:16,458 --> 00:30:17,875
A sub-inspector was here earlier.

529
00:30:18,042 --> 00:30:19,542
That's for the passport verification.

530
00:30:20,792 --> 00:30:22,917
[Vaembu] Isn't that too trivial
for a sub-inspector to visit?

531
00:30:25,917 --> 00:30:27,958
He gave me the creeps.

532
00:30:33,417 --> 00:30:34,375
[door closes]

533
00:30:39,917 --> 00:30:41,833
-And one more thing...
-[Mugil] Yes?

534
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,208
Oh!

535
00:30:44,583 --> 00:30:48,417
I, I don’t know how to say it.

536
00:30:48,625 --> 00:30:51,125
-The thing is...
-[doorbell rings]

537
00:30:51,958 --> 00:30:53,542
Come in, come in.

538
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:54,667
[chuckles]

539
00:30:55,208 --> 00:30:57,042
So sorry to impose!

540
00:30:57,125 --> 00:30:59,125
[Mugil] Not at all.
Please take your seats.

541
00:30:59,208 --> 00:31:00,667
-Thank you, thank you.
-Greetings!

542
00:31:00,833 --> 00:31:03,167
-Greetings, son!
-Get in everyone.

543
00:31:04,125 --> 00:31:05,042
Wow!

544
00:31:05,125 --> 00:31:06,875
[old man] Hey, don't touch that.
Don’t be a brat.

545
00:31:06,958 --> 00:31:08,458
-Don't take their stuff.
-[Aakash] Eh!

546
00:31:08,542 --> 00:31:11,292
-Give it back!
-[Aakash] No!

547
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,625
Here you are!

548
00:31:14,042 --> 00:31:15,375
[old man] That uncle will not like it.

549
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:17,167
[old woman] You're addicted to your iPad.

550
00:31:22,083 --> 00:31:24,375
My grandson is very playful.
[chuckles]

551
00:31:24,458 --> 00:31:25,667
I can see that.

552
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,583
[old man chuckles]

553
00:31:27,792 --> 00:31:28,708
Vaembu.

554
00:31:29,542 --> 00:31:31,333
These are guests of Mr. Mani.

555
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,792
They are in the living room.

556
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:34,250
Go say hello.

557
00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:38,708
-Welcome!
-Greetings!

558
00:31:39,583 --> 00:31:42,958
-What will you have?
-[old man] We just ate. Water will do.

559
00:31:45,833 --> 00:31:46,750
[sniffs]

560
00:31:51,833 --> 00:31:52,875
It...

561
00:31:53,708 --> 00:31:54,750
It may be cold.

562
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:01,167
Fuck!
[panting]

563
00:32:03,417 --> 00:32:04,917
[breathing heavily]

564
00:32:06,833 --> 00:32:08,250
[panting]

565
00:32:09,667 --> 00:32:11,625
[suspenseful music]

566
00:32:19,542 --> 00:32:20,583
It's...

567
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:22,458
It is indeed cold.

568
00:32:26,208 --> 00:32:27,208
[Aakash] Fuck!

569
00:32:27,292 --> 00:32:28,208
[gasps]

570
00:32:28,958 --> 00:32:30,125
Fuck!

571
00:32:30,375 --> 00:32:33,708
[singing] Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

572
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,833
[old man] Hey! Shush!

573
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:40,792
-[Aakash] Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
-[old man clicks tongue]

574
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,958
-[old woman] What is that, "fuck"?
-[old man] It's,

575
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:44,917
-it’s just a word.
-[Aakash] Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

576
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:46,625
-[old woman] I get that,
-Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

577
00:32:46,708 --> 00:32:48,167
-but what does it mean?
-Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

578
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,958
-[old man] It's an act of sin.
-[old woman] Just keep calm.

579
00:32:51,042 --> 00:32:54,708
[old woman] I'm asking, because Balaji
keeps using it all the time,

580
00:32:54,792 --> 00:32:57,208
-but he never tells me the meaning.
-[old man] Just leave it, I say.

581
00:32:57,292 --> 00:32:59,708
[old woman] Is Balaji using this word?
Let me talk to him.

582
00:32:59,917 --> 00:33:01,042
[whispers]
Who the fuck is that?

583
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,625
[whispers]
That’s what I was about to tell you.

584
00:33:06,583 --> 00:33:08,958
We went to the same college.

585
00:33:10,125 --> 00:33:11,792
We were in love.

586
00:33:11,917 --> 00:33:12,833
Huh?

587
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,708
This morning, we spoke on the phone

588
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:16,792
for the first time since our marriage.

589
00:33:17,792 --> 00:33:19,167
He sounded distressed.

590
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:21,333
I...

591
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:23,917
I felt guilty.

592
00:33:25,292 --> 00:33:26,875
I called him over. He came.

593
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:32,583
I don't know how it started.
[exhales sharply]

594
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:34,917
We did it.

595
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,625
He died in the process.

596
00:33:39,292 --> 00:33:42,292
-Huh? You...
-[clangs]

597
00:33:42,375 --> 00:33:44,500
[old man] Don’t bother making coffee.

598
00:33:48,042 --> 00:33:49,833
Just... half a cup?

599
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:57,208
[fridge door creaks]

600
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:03,208
[suspenseful music continues]

601
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:15,958
[door closes]

602
00:34:16,042 --> 00:34:18,500
[both grunt]

603
00:34:18,583 --> 00:34:19,667
Hey!

604
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,500
[grunting]

605
00:34:21,917 --> 00:34:23,667
[announcer] <i>You should decide
your own punishment.</i>

606
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:24,583
Hmm?

607
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:26,750
[both grunt]

608
00:34:26,958 --> 00:34:31,750
[TV announcer] <i>I am fine
with whatever you suggest.</i>

609
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:34,000
[announcer] <i>Mom!</i>

610
00:34:34,083 --> 00:34:37,958
There’s grape juice for adults inside.

611
00:34:38,292 --> 00:34:40,833
For a moment, I thought you were cheap.

612
00:34:41,208 --> 00:34:42,167
[chuckles]

613
00:34:42,917 --> 00:34:44,125
[old woman] Mugil!

614
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,625
I hope there’s no meat in the fridge.

615
00:34:46,792 --> 00:34:47,792
Not at all.

616
00:34:48,792 --> 00:34:50,292
[old woman] It's a religious thing.

617
00:34:50,458 --> 00:34:52,083
Huh. I understand.

618
00:34:54,542 --> 00:34:55,833
Its my fault, right.

619
00:34:56,167 --> 00:34:57,708
Let's call the cops. I’ll surrender.

620
00:34:58,583 --> 00:35:00,667
-I’ll go to jail.
-I’ll fucking kill...

621
00:35:03,042 --> 00:35:04,708
You'll be happy doing time.

622
00:35:04,958 --> 00:35:06,458
I'll be the one enduring the taunts.

623
00:35:06,625 --> 00:35:10,958
“He's that loser whose wife
fucked around.”

624
00:35:11,917 --> 00:35:13,292
I'd want to fucking rip my head off.

625
00:35:14,958 --> 00:35:15,875
Forget me.

626
00:35:16,125 --> 00:35:17,125
My poor parents,

627
00:35:18,958 --> 00:35:20,458
they'll hang themselves in shame.
[sobbing]

628
00:35:22,792 --> 00:35:26,292
I feel like smashing your fucking head
against the wall.

629
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:30,125
[panting]

630
00:35:30,542 --> 00:35:31,583
Okay, look.

631
00:35:32,542 --> 00:35:35,542
First let's get rid of the body.

632
00:35:35,917 --> 00:35:36,833
After which,

633
00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:39,667
I want you to sign the divorce papers
and get lost.

634
00:35:40,208 --> 00:35:41,250
Okay?

635
00:35:43,292 --> 00:35:46,042
I can't stand one more moment with you!

636
00:35:46,625 --> 00:35:47,708
Agreed?

637
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,500
Hey dickhead, stop!

638
00:35:56,583 --> 00:35:58,792
I can’t keep up, Soori!

639
00:36:00,042 --> 00:36:01,750
[Mohan] Stop, you dickhead!

640
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:05,333
I can’t run anymore!

641
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,083
Stop running, Soori!

642
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:11,792
At least take off those 3D glasses!

643
00:36:11,875 --> 00:36:12,875
You look so dumb!

644
00:36:12,958 --> 00:36:14,958
[Soori panting]

645
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:19,083
-[Soori sobbing]
-[Mohan panting]

646
00:36:19,667 --> 00:36:21,708
Hey, that’s not your mom.

647
00:36:22,458 --> 00:36:23,708
It is her!

648
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:26,083
I saw the mole on her back.

649
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,958
Many women have moles on their back.

650
00:36:28,292 --> 00:36:30,625
It's that unmistakable dime-sized mole!

651
00:36:31,042 --> 00:36:34,500
I’ve massaged her
shoulders so many times...

652
00:36:35,458 --> 00:36:37,292
with these hands!

653
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:38,667
Hey... hey!

654
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,250
[sobbing]

655
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:41,250
Dude!

656
00:36:41,583 --> 00:36:42,958
-This is so revolting!
-Hey, hey, buddy.

657
00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:44,042
-So disgusting!
-Hey, Soori!

658
00:36:44,125 --> 00:36:45,208
-So nauseating!
-Stop it, man.

659
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:46,542
Just stop it!

660
00:36:46,625 --> 00:36:48,625
-I feel like dousing myself with petrol,
-Please stop it.

661
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:49,708
and lighting myself on fire!

662
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:52,417
It's not like you can kill her for it!
What's happened has happened.

663
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,792
-You're so right! I should kill her!
-What?

664
00:36:55,875 --> 00:36:57,958
[Mohan] When did I... I didn't say that!

665
00:36:58,042 --> 00:36:59,583
-Stop, dude!

-[driver] Dickhead!
-[tire screeches]

667
00:37:01,292 --> 00:37:03,167
[driver] Did your mother shit you out
at birth?

668
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:05,458
Who flashed you that you're
rushing to jerk off?

669
00:37:05,542 --> 00:37:06,375
[Mohan] Don't do that!

670
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:07,792
-Hey, hey, hey! Stop!
-[glass breaks]

671
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:09,667
[Mohan] Your tongue will lead
you to an early death!

672
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:11,708
Little shit!

673
00:37:11,792 --> 00:37:13,750
[passenger] He broke your mirror,
sweet chariot!

674
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:14,750
Stop, dude!

675
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:16,750
-I'm coming for you!
-[Mohan] <i>Stop running, man!</i>

[Soori panting]

678
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:26,125
[Mohan] Hey, Soori! Stop!

679
00:37:26,875 --> 00:37:29,458
[Mohan panting]

680
00:37:35,667 --> 00:37:37,250
[old woman 2] See, he is running
like a jerk!

681
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:38,292
[old man 2] Careful, moron!

682

[tense music continues]

687
00:38:21,208 --> 00:38:23,667
[driver] Fucker ruined my morning!

688
00:38:29,208 --> 00:38:31,333
If I get my hands on him,
I'll fucking stab him! [groans]

Holy shit!

[Meenal] Leela!

692
00:38:41,958 --> 00:38:43,292
Didn’t Soori go to school today?

693
00:38:43,417 --> 00:38:44,917
He went in the morning.

694
00:38:45,042 --> 00:38:46,458
[Meenal] Why’s he rushing here, then?

695
00:38:46,583 --> 00:38:48,792
Maybe he forgot his uniform?

696
00:38:49,042 --> 00:38:50,667
No, he was wearing it this morning.

697
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,750

[suspenseful music]

730

[driver] Ma'am, look at you.
You are divine,

731
00:40:12,292 --> 00:40:15,458
and I insulted you!
No wonder he got angry!

732
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:18,417
-[driver] I yelled in a moment of anger.

Hello? Dhanashekar!

How much?

762
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,083
It's in great condition.

763
00:41:34,042 --> 00:41:35,958
Hold it for me.

00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:40,958
[shopkeeper 2] Okay, okay.

767
00:41:41,375 --> 00:41:42,625

[song playing]

769
00:41:50,667 --> 00:41:52,333
Move your ass, Gaaji!

-[Gaaji] Shit! It's the cops!
-[cop]<i> It's a photocopy, sir.</i>

772
00:42:01,917 --> 00:42:03,708
[Gaaji] Why the fuck are
you speeding towards them?

773
00:42:03,792 --> 00:42:05,708
[cop] Come here. Stop the vehicle.

774
00:42:05,917 --> 00:42:07,292
Why not take ten more on the bike?

775
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:08,750
Sir, we're blood donors.

776
00:42:08,833 --> 00:42:11,375
-There's been an accident.
-That's a petty case. Not like yours.

777
00:42:11,542 --> 00:42:15,042
-They are riding as triples.
-Shall I fine you?

778
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:16,625
-Go, go.
-Thank you, sir!

779
00:42:16,708 --> 00:42:17,750
-Get going!
-Thank you, sir!

780
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:21,167

I'll be back in a minute.

00:42:27,542 --> 00:42:28,875
Hey! Hey, dude!

784
00:42:29,042 --> 00:42:30,000
Where’s he going?

785
00:42:30,083 --> 00:42:31,292
To see Kavuchi.

786
00:42:31,458 --> 00:42:33,208
-Idi Ameen’s guy Kavuchi?
-Yes, buddy.

787
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:34,167
Come on, fellas.

788
00:42:37,917 --> 00:42:38,833
Hey, bro!

789
00:42:40,083 --> 00:42:41,458
[Gaaji] Dude, its too risky,

790
00:42:41,542 --> 00:42:43,125
like sliding down a blade.

791
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:44,750
[Vasanth] How else are we gonna earn
30,000 rupees?

792
00:42:44,833 --> 00:42:46,333
[Gaaji] What if he asks us
to kill someone?

793
00:42:46,417 --> 00:42:47,250
[Vasanth] We will kill.

794
00:42:48,125 --> 00:42:49,167
[Gaaji] Is that really you?

795
00:42:49,375 --> 00:42:51,667
I have a very bad feeling about this.
Listen to me.

796
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:53,583
We're so fucked already!

797
00:42:53,708 --> 00:42:56,250
[Vasanth] Thooyavan's dad
will skin us all alive!

798
00:42:56,333 --> 00:42:57,750
He's a dangerous man!

799
00:42:58,208 --> 00:42:59,958
[Gaaji] Bro, is earning
30,000 rupees possible?

800
00:43:00,083 --> 00:43:01,917
-[Kavuchi] Remember Alroy?
-[Gaaji] Who?

801
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:04,542
[Kavuchi] The crow.

802
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:06,375
That crow, dude!

803
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,333
[Gaaji] Yeah, yes.

804
00:43:10,958 --> 00:43:13,417
Bro, what happened to Alroy?

805
00:43:14,083 --> 00:43:16,625
Last week he went to Idi Ameen for a job.

806
00:43:17,458 --> 00:43:20,250
He was sent to burn
a political party's flag.

807
00:43:20,333 --> 00:43:21,500
-He did it.
-Mm-hmm.

808
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:22,958
A half-hour job, and he was

809
00:43:23,125 --> 00:43:24,708
given 23,500 rupees.

810
00:43:25,083 --> 00:43:26,792
23 times 500 equals...

811
00:43:27,083 --> 00:43:29,125
-If he had quoted a price,
-Ten, eleven...

812
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:31,292
-he'd have lost a tooth.
-how much is it?

813
00:43:31,667 --> 00:43:34,875
[Kavuchi] One never quotes a number
to Idi Ameen.

814
00:43:34,958 --> 00:43:36,042
He takes it personally.

815
00:43:36,167 --> 00:43:37,000
[Gaaji] Okay, bro.

816
00:43:37,792 --> 00:43:38,625
Greetings, bro!

817
00:43:38,708 --> 00:43:39,542
Is sir there?

818
00:43:39,708 --> 00:43:40,708
Yeah, but he's cranky.

819
00:43:41,083 --> 00:43:41,958
You hear that?

820
00:43:42,042 --> 00:43:44,542
Him being cranky means there's a job,

821
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,875
and there are no takers.

822
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:49,083
Lucky devils, you are.

823
00:43:49,833 --> 00:43:50,833
Greetings, bro.

824
00:43:50,917 --> 00:43:53,083
-[Kavuchi] Hmm.
-Is he there?

825
00:43:53,167 --> 00:43:54,042
[Kavuchi] Hmm.

826
00:44:00,792 --> 00:44:01,917
Hey! Get up!

827
00:44:02,042 --> 00:44:05,333
You can't sit in front of his chair!
Got it? He might come anytime.

828
00:44:10,417 --> 00:44:12,542
[victorious music]

829
00:44:13,792 --> 00:44:14,792
Good morning, sir.

830
00:44:24,958 --> 00:44:25,917
Dude!

831
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,417
[creaking]

832
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:30,625
Up!

833
00:44:37,167 --> 00:44:38,583
What’s up?

834
00:44:38,917 --> 00:44:41,375
They want to make a quick buck.

835
00:44:43,042 --> 00:44:45,375
[whispers]
Sir, assess them first.

836
00:44:48,417 --> 00:44:50,208
What was the last film you saw?

837
00:44:53,792 --> 00:44:56,083
Hey cat-kid, you answer.

838
00:44:57,333 --> 00:44:58,458
<i>Mallu Uncut.</i>

839
00:44:58,833 --> 00:44:59,917
What film?

840
00:45:00,042 --> 00:45:01,167
<i>Mallu Uncut.</i>

841
00:45:02,542 --> 00:45:03,833
Is it an award winning film?

842
00:45:04,042 --> 00:45:05,625
Just a good film, sir.

843
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:09,042
Audience's pleasure
is the only award it seeks.

844
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:12,625
Are the boys capable?

845
00:45:12,792 --> 00:45:13,792
Trustworthy?

846
00:45:13,875 --> 00:45:15,708
I guarantee that.

847
00:45:23,875 --> 00:45:25,292
You look up, Kavuchi.

848
00:45:41,333 --> 00:45:42,750
Did you see the photo?

849
00:45:48,292 --> 00:45:49,750
Go to Maya Plaza.

850
00:45:50,375 --> 00:45:53,958
The man in the photo
will be there with a cup of bad tea,

851
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:58,958
flirting with some shady woman.

852
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,333
Put four drops of this into his tea.

853
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:06,000
Make sure he drinks it,

854
00:46:06,375 --> 00:46:07,500
then report to me. Okay?

855
00:46:22,417 --> 00:46:23,667
Is this your first mission?

856
00:46:24,583 --> 00:46:25,750
Kill it.

857
00:46:32,917 --> 00:46:35,708
[Idi Ameen] Hey, avoid direct
contact with that liquid.

858
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:36,833
Yes, sir.

859
00:46:38,542 --> 00:46:39,708
[Idi Ameen] Comrades...

860
00:46:42,292 --> 00:46:43,875
are you confident?

861
00:46:45,667 --> 00:46:46,667
Yes...

862
00:46:46,792 --> 00:46:49,208
-Yes!
-Yes, yes.

863
00:46:49,292 --> 00:46:51,250
[upbeat music]

864
00:46:57,042 --> 00:46:58,458
I, too, shall take my leave, sir.

865
00:47:41,292 --> 00:47:42,167
[clanging]

866
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:43,875
-Why the fuck did you come back?
-Hey, wait.

867
00:47:43,958 --> 00:47:45,208
-You left my sister!
-Listen, man.

868
00:47:45,333 --> 00:47:46,667
-Why didn't you stay gone?
-Calm down.

869
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:49,875
-Let go of me! What are you looking at?
-Take him outside.

870
00:47:49,958 --> 00:47:51,833
-I'll fucking kill you!
-Go shout outside.

871
00:47:51,917 --> 00:47:53,333
Would you be okay if it was your sister?

872
00:47:53,417 --> 00:47:54,250
What happened now?

873
00:47:54,333 --> 00:47:55,667
-What happened now?
-Let me go, I say.

874
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:56,583
I'll fucking kill you!

875
00:47:56,667 --> 00:47:59,333
What's the ruckus all about?
Ah. He brought home a new wife!

876
00:47:59,417 --> 00:48:00,667
Where is he?

877
00:48:01,042 --> 00:48:02,458
My treasure.

878
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:04,167
[old man 3 chuckles]

879
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:06,292
Polygamy is a common thing for us.

880
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:10,042
The girl looks slightly manly.

881
00:48:10,708 --> 00:48:12,167
So what?

882
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:14,917
Take my grandmother for instance.

883
00:48:15,167 --> 00:48:16,625
She was extremely hairy,

884
00:48:16,708 --> 00:48:19,167
with a mustache and beard, too!

885
00:48:19,292 --> 00:48:21,375
Yet my granddad was the happiest.

886
00:48:21,583 --> 00:48:23,750
[old man 3]
It's only the heart that matters.

887
00:48:23,833 --> 00:48:26,250
Hey, someone throw this old man
under a speeding truck!

888
00:48:26,333 --> 00:48:27,958
-He's so rude.
-Come, Grandpa.

889
00:48:28,042 --> 00:48:30,083
-Grandpa, come quietly!
-Why?

890
00:48:30,375 --> 00:48:32,833
-Wisdom is so unappreciated.
-I'll follow your words.

891
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,958
-I've always wanted to divorce him!
-Come now.

892
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:40,875
[old man 3] I have such
rich experiences to share.

893
00:48:41,125 --> 00:48:42,917
I can be so helpful...

894
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,750
-but nobody's interested.
-[woman 8] Okay, grandpa.

895
00:48:44,875 --> 00:48:47,208
-Manickam,
-[old man 3] They are so reckless...

896
00:48:47,292 --> 00:48:48,750
Go freshen up.

897
00:48:48,833 --> 00:48:50,792
-We can talk later.
-[woman 8] Don't bother them.

899

[indistinct chatter continues]

900
00:49:23,958 --> 00:49:26,750
[old woman 3] Jyothi, why does life
screw you over and over again?

901
00:49:27,667 --> 00:49:31,125
Why does misery love you so much?

902
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:34,667
As a mother, I shouldn't say this.

903
00:49:35,083 --> 00:49:37,000
Instead of waiting for him,

904
00:49:37,125 --> 00:49:39,458
you could've eloped with another man.

905
00:49:40,667 --> 00:49:42,208
[sniffles]

906
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:48,125
Mom, dad wants the sari with the tassels
to wear to school.

907
00:49:49,167 --> 00:49:50,833
[woman 8] How is that?

908
00:49:50,958 --> 00:49:52,708
[old man 3] I went to him
to ask about it...

909
00:49:53,458 --> 00:49:56,250
-She is a foreigner, it seems.
-Damn!

910
00:49:56,333 --> 00:49:59,167
Even in the early days of marriage,

911
00:49:59,458 --> 00:50:01,667
he'd fake a headache every night,

912
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:03,042
like a disinterested wife.

913
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:05,958
That should have raised a red flag.

914
00:50:06,458 --> 00:50:10,625
Yet Jyothi managed to produce Raasu Kutti!

915
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:12,458
That talented cow!

[radio music continues]

919
00:51:56,583 --> 00:51:59,208
At first, I thought
it was an April Fool’s prank.

920
00:52:10,375 --> 00:52:11,708
[Shilpa] Do I look pretty?

921
00:52:12,917 --> 00:52:16,375
I need to look
good for Raasu Kutti’s friends.

922
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,583
[sobbing]

923
00:52:18,667 --> 00:52:20,708
I don’t know what’s harder:

924
00:52:21,583 --> 00:52:23,750
A past without a husband,

925
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:26,292
or a future with one like you.

926
00:52:31,958 --> 00:52:34,292
As a woman,
I understand your plight, Jyothi.

927
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,375
[sobbing]

928
00:52:39,583 --> 00:52:40,792
[Raasu Kutti] Dad, shall we leave?

929
00:52:43,292 --> 00:52:44,417
[Shilpa] Shall I go?

930
00:52:48,792 --> 00:52:51,833
[Manickam's mom]
You've done enough damage.

931
00:52:51,917 --> 00:52:52,833
Stay home.

932
00:52:52,917 --> 00:52:55,083
Save us a shred of dignity!

933
00:52:55,208 --> 00:52:56,958
-Hey Raasu Kutti, get back in!
-[Jyothi] Mom!

00:52:57,167 --> 00:52:58,625
-You big bastard, come back!
-Mom!

00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:00,583
-Little bastard! At least you!
-Mom,

936
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:02,917
let him be. At least he's happy.

937
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,125
Amazing!

938
00:53:04,375 --> 00:53:06,625
Raasu Kutti accepted his stepmom

-instantly!
-Shut up, you compost pit!

940
00:53:08,792 --> 00:53:10,375
I’ll throw you in the fire!

-He said that she's well settled now,
-[suspenseful music]

943
00:53:19,625 --> 00:53:21,292
and her sister also got married...

944
00:53:21,375 --> 00:53:24,167
-Oh, the coffee is here.
-[old woman] Thank you.

945
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:26,542
-[Mugil] Don't mention it.
-[old woman] Thanks.

00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:33,625
[old man] What was I saying?

949
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,125
Oh yes... Meera...

950
00:53:36,208 --> 00:53:38,500
She is very different now...

951
00:53:38,583 --> 00:53:39,792
[Mugil whispers]
Did you Google it?

952
00:53:39,875 --> 00:53:41,917
-Yeah.
-What does it say?

953
00:53:42,333 --> 00:53:45,583
[whispering]
Fill a plastic tub with acid,

954
00:53:45,667 --> 00:53:46,750
immerse the body in it.

955
00:53:46,833 --> 00:53:48,375
It will dissolve in one week!

956
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,292
No time for that. What else?

957
00:53:51,667 --> 00:53:53,667
Fill a drum with cement mix,

958
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:55,042
immerse the body.

959
00:53:55,208 --> 00:53:57,042
Wait till it hardens,
and dump it in the sea!

00:53:58,542 --> 00:53:59,500
Fuck you, Google!

[suspenseful music]

962
00:54:15,917 --> 00:54:18,625
We chop the body into bits,
put them in separate plastic bags,

963
00:54:18,792 --> 00:54:21,042
and leave them for stray dogs
in different areas.

964
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:24,875
People will think someone dropped
meat from the butchers.

965
00:54:24,958 --> 00:54:27,042
Hey, you're the one that killed him,
so you chop.

966
00:54:28,833 --> 00:54:29,875
I didn't kill him.

967
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,083
He died by himself.

968
00:54:31,417 --> 00:54:33,042
You were the reason. So you chop.

00:54:41,208 --> 00:54:43,667

00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:10,708
I heard you use the F-word.

976
00:55:11,542 --> 00:55:13,042
Of all the words we speak,

977
00:55:13,667 --> 00:55:16,083
you kids pick up the swear words.

978
00:55:17,083 --> 00:55:20,042
Use that word again...

00:55:21,375 --> 00:55:23,625
I'll cut off your wee-wee
and throw it to the fucking crows!

00:55:24,958 --> 00:55:26,958
Now go out there and keep your mouth shut.

982
00:55:29,083 --> 00:55:29,958
Hmm.

983
00:55:30,792 --> 00:55:31,625
Go.

984
00:55:44,833 --> 00:55:46,792
[whispers]
I was so scared

985
00:55:47,625 --> 00:55:49,000
that I had to scare him.

986
00:55:50,333 --> 00:55:51,833
You get the logic?

987
00:55:52,333 --> 00:55:54,333
[suspenseful music]

988
00:56:02,292 --> 00:56:05,500

Shit! Give it!

[gasps]

996
00:56:39,292 --> 00:56:41,458
Shit! I can’t either!

997
00:56:42,083 --> 00:56:43,458
Do I need this shit?

998
00:56:43,542 --> 00:56:44,667
This is my fucking dad's fault!

999
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:47,708
"She comes from a good family," he said.
“Belongs to our caste.”

1000
00:56:47,833 --> 00:56:50,208
[whispers]
What? You chose me based on caste?

1001
00:56:50,417 --> 00:56:51,667
Shame on you!

1002
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:53,167
You're talking about shame?

1003
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:56,667
Why is it that one
can be proud of his country,

1004
00:56:56,792 --> 00:56:58,208
his language,

1005
00:56:58,292 --> 00:56:59,833
but not his caste?

1006
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:02,667
Everything is about labeling people.
Only the names differ.

1007
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:05,708
You're a patriot if you love your country.
You're a patron if you love your language.

1008
00:57:05,792 --> 00:57:07,500
But be proud of your caste,
and you're a fanatic.

Hypo-fuckin-pocrisy!

1010
00:57:09,167 --> 00:57:11,542
[Mugil] The common man discriminates
in the name of caste.

1011
00:57:11,667 --> 00:57:13,958
A patriot discriminates
in the name of nationality.

1012
00:57:14,417 --> 00:57:15,417
Both are equally wrong!

1013
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:18,458
But no one sees that angle!

1014
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,167

1015
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,708
Hey! What are you doing?

1016
00:57:23,083 --> 00:57:24,750
We'll stuff the body inside,

1017
00:57:24,833 --> 00:57:27,833
-throw it down from the balcony.
-[Vaembu] Huh? What?

1018
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:29,625
Don't worry.

1019
00:57:29,708 --> 00:57:30,667
We'll drop it like this,

1020
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:32,333
and it will bounce and fall flat.

1021
00:57:38,042 --> 00:57:39,042

-[neighbor 2] I don't know!

[neighbor 1] Who are they, mom?

1024
00:57:48,542 --> 00:57:50,083
[Vaembu] Can't we do this
after they leave?

1025
00:57:50,167 --> 00:57:53,667
-[Mugil] No, because they're our alibis.
-[neighbor 2] Please come and sit inside.

1026

-Will it work?

1029
00:58:02,417 --> 00:58:03,250
Uh-huh.

1030
00:58:03,333 --> 00:58:04,750
What if it splatters?

1031
00:58:04,833 --> 00:58:07,042
How the fuck do I know?
I don't dispose of bodies for a living.

1032
00:58:07,125 --> 00:58:08,375

1036
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:25,125
-[Mugil] Come, let’s go!
-[Vaembu sighs]

1037
00:58:25,917 --> 00:58:27,333
[Mugil] Gather all his stuff.

1038
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:29,708
I'll go make an excuse to leave.

1039
00:58:30,208 --> 00:58:32,042
It should be believable.

1040
00:58:32,583 --> 00:58:35,250
[Mugil] Wait! Why do I need an excuse
to leave my own house?

1041
00:58:35,708 --> 00:58:36,958
Come, Vaembu. Fast!

1042
00:58:39,083 --> 00:58:41,333
Sorry, something’s come up. We have to go.

1043
00:58:41,417 --> 00:58:43,000
No, no you can stay.
Make yourself at home.

1044
00:58:43,083 --> 00:58:45,000
-Help yourself to our food.
-[old man] Sure, thank you.

1045
00:58:45,083 --> 00:58:46,542
You can drop off the keys with Mr. Mani.

1046
00:58:46,625 --> 00:58:49,042
Aakash, they’re leaving. Say bye-bye.

00:59:13,458 --> 00:59:15,292
-He listens only to women.
-Yes!

1057
00:59:15,375 --> 00:59:17,875
He takes after his dad.

1058
00:59:17,958 --> 00:59:19,375
Am I correct?

00:59:35,375 --> 00:59:36,250
Nothing.

1063
00:59:37,208 --> 00:59:38,042
Tell me.

1064
00:59:39,417 --> 00:59:41,375
I've only heard them say it in the movies,

1065
00:59:41,833 --> 00:59:42,833
but you did it for real.

1066
00:59:43,792 --> 00:59:44,667
What?

1067

There are still power cuts!

1076
01:00:10,167 --> 01:00:11,750
Burn buses. Cause riots!

1077
01:00:11,917 --> 01:00:12,958
Mob mentality!

1078
01:00:13,083 --> 01:00:15,583
-Bloody democracy feeds on mob mentality!
-Why're you losing your shit?

1079
01:00:15,667 --> 01:00:18,292
All because of tension!
What if someone sees the body?

1080
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:22,500

-I don't know if it hit the spine.
-[Leela] Oh, my god!

1105
01:02:50,292 --> 01:02:53,875
[doctor] There may be complications,
and the possibility of paralysis.

1106
01:02:53,958 --> 01:02:57,542
-[Leela] What are you saying, doctor?
-Let's hope not. Don't risk it! Go now!

1107
01:02:57,667 --> 01:03:00,417
-How much will it cost?
-I don’t know. Quick, go!

1108
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:02,667
I’ll call the hospital and inform them.
Rush now!

01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:04,667
-Meenal, I'll be right back!
-I'll tell them.

[doctor] Hello, this is Dr. T. R. Balaji.

1112
01:03:12,875 --> 01:03:14,958
-[Arputham] What happened Meenal?
-I don’t know, Dhanasekar.

1113
01:03:15,042 --> 01:03:17,167
He was angry. He came with a screwdriver.
I don't know why.

1114
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:20,500
[Arputham] I know why! It's the same
reason I wanted to kill myself!

1115
01:03:20,583 --> 01:03:22,458
Lift him! Let’s go.

1116
01:03:22,542 --> 01:03:24,292
[Meenal] Wait, Dhanashekar!
Let Leela come back!

1117
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:25,875
[Arputham] Why should I wait for her?

1118
01:03:25,958 --> 01:03:27,792
She's not a mother.
She's a sinner! A sinner!

1119
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:30,333
[Leela] What is this?
Where are you taking him?

1120
01:03:30,417 --> 01:03:32,625
[Meenal] Wait, wait. We have
to take him to a private hospital.

1121
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:34,333
[Arputham] There is no greater doctor
than God!

1122
01:03:34,417 --> 01:03:36,125
[Leela] The doctor suggested
immediate treatment.

1123
01:03:36,208 --> 01:03:37,750
I have saved many lives
with God’s blessings.

1124
01:03:37,833 --> 01:03:41,167
-[Arputham] Fear not. Believe in Him!
-[Leela] Pull Soori back! Pull!

1125
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:42,833
[Arputham] I doubted my God.
I doubted my God.

1126
01:03:42,917 --> 01:03:44,667
For just one day, didn't do
what I was saved to do.

1127
01:03:44,750 --> 01:03:47,792
-And he has punished me.
-[Meenal] Don't worry, Soori!

1128
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:49,542
[Arputham] Forgive me, my Lord.
Save my son.

1129
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:50,625
[Meenal] What are you doing?

1130
01:03:50,708 --> 01:03:52,792
He's hurt in the stomach, Dhanashekar.
Don't bend him!

1131
01:03:52,917 --> 01:03:54,042
Stop, Dhanasekar.

1132
01:03:54,125 --> 01:03:55,458
What are you doing? Stop, Dhanashekar!

1133
01:03:55,542 --> 01:03:57,167
[Arputham] I am not Dhanashekar!
I am Arputham.

1134
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:58,083
[Meenal] What is this?

1135
01:03:58,167 --> 01:03:59,875
[Arputham] Tsunami God’s
miracle slave, Arputham.

1136
01:03:59,958 --> 01:04:01,667
Tsunami God's insignificant
servant, Arputham!

1137
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:03,792
-Save my son, my Lord!
-[Meenal] He's Leela's son too!

1138
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,292
-[Arputham] Save my son...
-Please take him to the hospital!

1139
01:04:06,375 --> 01:04:08,167
-Save him, my Lord!

-[Meenal] Leela!

1142
01:04:13,667 --> 01:04:15,375
Dhanashekar came and took Soori.

1143
01:04:15,458 --> 01:04:17,833
-[Leela] To which hospital?
-[Meenal] Not a hospital, to his shrine!

1144
01:04:17,917 --> 01:04:20,208
[Leela] What am I going
to do with this madman!

1145
01:04:20,292 --> 01:04:21,458

[Leela] Open the door!
I want my son alive!

I’ll hold your hand, you hold mine!

1180
01:05:46,625 --> 01:05:49,667
[Ramasamy] You do not realize the power
of Arputham’s simple prayers.

1181
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:52,958
If there is a power greater than God,

-[Leela] Please, Ramasamy! I beg you.

Meenal, did you call the councilor?

1187
01:06:05,583 --> 01:06:06,750
I did. He's on his way.

01:16:23,333 --> 01:16:25,125
Of course not! I asked him to do it.

1375
01:16:25,208 --> 01:16:26,167
Why?

1376
01:16:26,333 --> 01:16:28,667
I always wanted to be a woman.

1377
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:31,792
Dressing up. Make up. That's what I like.

1378
01:16:36,375 --> 01:16:37,917
[Raasu Kutti] Where were you
all this time?

1379
01:16:39,583 --> 01:16:40,625
[Shilpa] In Bombay.

1380
01:16:40,875 --> 01:16:42,292
[Raasu Kutti] What were you doing there?

1381
01:16:44,583 --> 01:16:45,417
[Shilpa] Nothing.

1382
01:16:45,833 --> 01:16:47,583
[Raasu Kutti] What about money for food?

1383
01:16:49,667 --> 01:16:51,167
[Shilpa] We’d visit shops, clap our hands.

1384
01:16:51,667 --> 01:16:54,208
We'd bless them! They’d pay us.

1385
01:16:54,333 --> 01:16:56,583
[Raasu Kutti chuckles]
No way!

1386
01:16:57,083 --> 01:16:58,167
I swear, Raasu Kutti.

1387
01:16:58,417 --> 01:16:59,625
Wanna see?

1388
01:17:01,292 --> 01:17:02,833
[claps]
Huh?

1389
01:17:04,958 --> 01:17:05,958
[clicks tongue]

1390
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:10,708
[mumbles]

1391
01:17:12,458 --> 01:17:13,667
Uh. Uh.

1392
01:17:19,208 --> 01:17:21,167
Come here.

1393
01:17:26,833 --> 01:17:29,958
[imitates fanfare]

1394
01:17:30,167 --> 01:17:33,125
Oh, my! You just kicked ass!

1395
01:17:33,625 --> 01:17:35,958
-[Raasu Kutti] Will I be like you, too?
-[vendor] Peanuts, peanuts!

1396
01:17:36,042 --> 01:17:38,625
-[Shilpa] I don’t know, Raasu Kutti.
-[man 7] Give me a packet of peanuts.

1397
01:17:38,708 --> 01:17:41,750
A decade back, if someone
had told me that I’d become like this,

1398
01:17:41,833 --> 01:17:43,375
I wouldn’t have believed it myself.

1399
01:17:43,958 --> 01:17:46,458
[Raasu Kutti] Why weren’t you
born a woman to begin with?

1400
01:17:46,625 --> 01:17:49,750
[Shilpa] Sometimes, when we put
on our shoes in a hurry,

1401
01:17:49,875 --> 01:17:52,042
we confuse the left with the right.

1402
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:54,333
Similarly, God, in a hurry,
put me in a male body.

1403
01:17:57,458 --> 01:17:59,958
[airplane engine whirring]

1404
01:18:00,625 --> 01:18:02,375
[Raasu Kutti] Have you been on a plane?

1405
01:18:02,458 --> 01:18:04,833
[Shilpa] No, but I'd love to.

1406
01:18:05,667 --> 01:18:08,167
[Raasu Kutti] If you have a baby,
will you breastfeed it?

1407
01:18:08,708 --> 01:18:10,208
[Shilpa] No, I can’t have babies.

1408
01:18:10,292 --> 01:18:12,708
-[Raasu Kutti] Why?
-[Shilpa] God mixed up the shoes.

1409
01:18:12,833 --> 01:18:14,875
[Raasu Kutti] God is such a jerk!

1410
01:18:17,667 --> 01:18:18,833
[Raasu Kutti] No peeking!

1411
01:18:19,292 --> 01:18:20,500
[Shilpa] I’m not looking.

1412
01:18:20,583 --> 01:18:22,500
[Raasukutti] Don’t look here! Look away!

1413
01:18:22,750 --> 01:18:25,292
[Shilpa] I’m not looking, Raasukutti.
[chuckles]

1414
01:18:25,708 --> 01:18:27,500
[Raasukutti] Do you use the men’s loo

1415
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:29,125
or the women’s loo?

1416
01:18:29,458 --> 01:18:31,917
[Shilpa] Ideally, the women’s loo.

1417
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:33,542
But we're not allowed.

1418
01:18:33,833 --> 01:18:35,208
-[Raasukutti] Ouch!
-[Shilpa] Oh, god!

1419
01:18:35,375 --> 01:18:36,458
What happened, Raasu Kutti?

1420
01:18:36,583 --> 01:18:37,833
My zipper is stuck.

1421
01:18:37,917 --> 01:18:39,000
No biggie.

1422
01:18:40,792 --> 01:18:44,042
Now that you are a woman,
should I call you Dad or Mom?

1423
01:18:44,125 --> 01:18:47,750
I never thought about that.
How about you call me by my Bombay name?

1424
01:18:47,833 --> 01:18:50,083
[cop] Fucking asshole! You disgusting,
filthy scum of the earth!

1425
01:18:50,167 --> 01:18:52,417
Couldn’t you find an adult
to get off with?

1426
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:53,792
[Shilpa] Sir. No. No, he’s my son!

1427
01:18:53,875 --> 01:18:55,542
What are you doing with it?

1428
01:18:55,708 --> 01:18:57,750
-He is my son, sir!
-What’s the kid’s name?

1429
01:18:57,875 --> 01:18:58,875
Raasu Kutti, sir.

1430
01:18:58,958 --> 01:19:00,708
-What?
-Raasu Kutti, sir.

1431
01:19:02,167 --> 01:19:03,958
You fucking, lying whore!
I'll bloody kill you!

1432
01:19:04,083 --> 01:19:06,292
-That's his pet name. I swear it's my son!
-How dare you lie!

1433
01:19:06,417 --> 01:19:07,542
My son! My son!

1434
01:19:07,625 --> 01:19:09,542
-Hey you, come here! Come!
-Come, Raasukutti.

1435
01:19:09,625 --> 01:19:12,500
-Go! I know your tricks, you whore.
-Raasukutti, come with me.

1436
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:16,167
[siren blaring]

1437
01:19:16,333 --> 01:19:18,917
[Vasanth] Save the poor soul
in the ambulance, Jesus!

1438
01:19:27,167 --> 01:19:30,375
Dude. Are you busy?
Can you help me find this place?

1439
01:19:31,042 --> 01:19:34,042
[boy] Go left, then take a right.
It's next to that Rupa Auntie's shop.

1440
01:19:34,125 --> 01:19:36,792
[Gaaji] Rupa Auntie?
When did she become "auntie?"

1441
01:19:37,042 --> 01:19:38,667
She’s just Rupa to us.

1442
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,083
Such a hottie!

1443
01:19:40,167 --> 01:19:41,375
She used to do yoga.

1444
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:44,042
The whole neighborhood followed her.

1445
01:19:44,542 --> 01:19:45,583
What an angel.

1446
01:19:45,667 --> 01:19:47,000
She turned organic.

1447
01:19:47,333 --> 01:19:48,708
Such an idealist.

1448
01:19:48,917 --> 01:19:50,875
By the way... you're most welcome.

1449
01:19:50,958 --> 01:19:52,042
God bless you!

1450
01:19:54,875 --> 01:19:56,083
[whispers]
Let's go.

1451
01:19:58,458 --> 01:20:00,583
[Gaaji] Dude, did I make sense?

1452
01:20:14,875 --> 01:20:17,292
[Thooyavan] How do you know
he’ll drink the milk?

1453
01:20:17,375 --> 01:20:20,208
[Vasanth] He looks like
a classic milk-drinker.

1454
01:20:20,875 --> 01:20:23,542
Wow!

1455
01:20:24,083 --> 01:20:29,042
Holy mother! They're shades...
but they make you hotter!

1456
01:20:31,833 --> 01:20:33,833
Once upon a time,
there lived a cruel king.

1457
01:20:34,458 --> 01:20:36,167
He was jealous of his own child,

1458
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,208
as he thought the queen loved the child
more than him.

1459
01:20:39,292 --> 01:20:43,375
So he rubbed poison
on the queen’s nipples.

1460
01:20:44,917 --> 01:20:46,583
He didn't want to see the child die,

1461
01:20:46,667 --> 01:20:47,792
so he went hunting.

1462
01:20:48,417 --> 01:20:49,667
When he came back,

1463
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:50,833
the minister lay dead.

1464
01:20:52,292 --> 01:20:53,625
Dude, what's with the bedtime story?

1465
01:20:54,333 --> 01:20:57,625
As in the story, what if she drinks
the milk that's meant for him?

1466
01:20:57,708 --> 01:20:58,542
[clicks tongue]

1467
01:21:03,125 --> 01:21:04,208
[man 8] Beat it.

1468
01:21:07,667 --> 01:21:08,750
-[man 8] Drink up!
-Thanks.

1469
01:21:09,167 --> 01:21:10,625
[sighs]

1470
01:21:11,458 --> 01:21:12,375
Dude!

1471
01:21:12,458 --> 01:21:14,958
What if he only pays us
10k for a half-hour job?

1472
01:21:15,458 --> 01:21:16,792
Why aren't you drinking?

1473
01:21:16,875 --> 01:21:18,708
-Cheers!
-Oh, cheers!

1474
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:22,625
When you take a life, you only get paid.

1475
01:21:22,708 --> 01:21:25,667
When you save a life, he'll give anything!

1476
01:21:25,750 --> 01:21:26,625
Correct, dude!

1477
01:21:27,167 --> 01:21:28,917
-Hey, stop!
-Hey, hey!

1478
01:21:29,042 --> 01:21:30,667
Sir, don't drink the milk!

1479
01:21:30,750 --> 01:21:32,042
The king has poisoned it!

1480
01:21:32,167 --> 01:21:33,000
Who?

1481
01:21:33,083 --> 01:21:34,208
Idi Ameen!

1482
01:21:34,583 --> 01:21:36,417
[chuckles]

1483
01:21:40,458 --> 01:21:41,333
Serve him, too!

1484
01:21:42,667 --> 01:21:43,667
Eat well!

1485
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:49,333
If I relied on your guarantee
and gave them a real mission,

1486
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:51,208
imagine what would have happened.

1487
01:21:52,542 --> 01:21:54,708
-Did you eat?
-[Kavuchi] No, Sir.

1488
01:21:54,875 --> 01:21:58,375
[Idi Ameen] Good.
It's better for the position you're in.

1489
01:22:06,833 --> 01:22:09,958
Eat, you clowns.

1490
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:19,792
I'm coming.

1491
01:22:23,917 --> 01:22:27,208
You should never refuse food.

1492
01:22:30,750 --> 01:22:33,833
You never know when the next meal will be.

1493
01:22:37,792 --> 01:22:39,375
That was my childhood in a nutshell.

1494
01:22:45,208 --> 01:22:47,833
Look how far I've come.

1495
01:22:51,333 --> 01:22:52,458
Thanks to my...

1496
01:22:56,375 --> 01:22:57,500
character.

1497
01:22:57,583 --> 01:22:58,667
[burps]

1498
01:23:07,042 --> 01:23:08,083
Come.

1499
01:23:15,667 --> 01:23:18,625
-Cleverness will only take you so far.
-[thuds]

1500
01:23:19,250 --> 01:23:20,500
[sighs]

1501
01:23:44,958 --> 01:23:46,083
[loud slap]

1502
01:23:46,542 --> 01:23:47,750
[sniffs]

1503
01:23:48,917 --> 01:23:49,917
[thuds]

1504
01:23:53,583 --> 01:23:54,583
[chuckles]

1505
01:23:56,042 --> 01:23:57,042
Go.

1506
01:24:02,833 --> 01:24:03,833
You!

1507
01:24:07,167 --> 01:24:08,417
Mmm.

1508
01:24:09,042 --> 01:24:09,917
Move it!

1509
01:24:14,667 --> 01:24:15,875
[gasps]

1510
01:24:16,958 --> 01:24:18,375
-Uh!
-[gasps]

1511
01:24:19,542 --> 01:24:21,708
[upbeat music]

1512
01:24:37,250 --> 01:24:39,250
[upbeat music continues]

1513
01:24:54,167 --> 01:24:58,542
[Kavuchi panting]

1514
01:25:14,083 --> 01:25:15,542
Do you know where they live?

1515
01:25:15,958 --> 01:25:16,875
Yes!

1516
01:25:17,875 --> 01:25:19,458
[Idi Ameen] Can you guarantee that?

1517
01:25:19,542 --> 01:25:20,583
[sobbing]

1518
01:25:23,417 --> 01:25:25,750
By evening, buy a TV for me, too.

1519
01:25:26,042 --> 01:25:26,958
Okay?

1520
01:25:27,542 --> 01:25:29,750
[upbeat music]

1521
01:25:46,125 --> 01:25:49,583
Sorry guys,
I'm not good with getting beat up.

1522
01:25:49,708 --> 01:25:51,875
Why? Are you fucking royalty?

1523
01:25:51,958 --> 01:25:54,417
Didn't Gaaji take it like a king?

1524
01:25:54,542 --> 01:25:55,958
Yes!

1525
01:25:56,042 --> 01:25:59,250
It was your TV that Soori broke!
Why the fuck should I take it?

1526
01:25:59,417 --> 01:26:00,833
-Egg Muffin!
-Yes?

1527
01:26:00,917 --> 01:26:01,875
[thwacks]

1528
01:26:04,875 --> 01:26:07,542
Punching me is justified, bro.

1529
01:26:07,625 --> 01:26:09,583
But him? I don't get it!

1530
01:26:09,667 --> 01:26:11,958
What matters is the message,
not the messenger.

1531
01:26:12,375 --> 01:26:15,750
But not on the face dude!
I need my good looks.

1532
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:17,125
Indeed.

1533
01:26:17,208 --> 01:26:18,625
[grunts]
Let’s go, guys.

1534
01:26:19,958 --> 01:26:21,708
Dude, I’m a little hungry.

1535
01:26:22,375 --> 01:26:24,583
We need, like, two TVs by tonight.

1536
01:26:24,667 --> 01:26:26,458
At least pretend to care, Blubber Belly!

1537
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:29,917
[bike revving]

1538
01:26:33,083 --> 01:26:34,292
[Gaaji] Let's steal, dude!

1539
01:26:34,542 --> 01:26:35,667
From the northies' house.

1540
01:26:35,792 --> 01:26:39,417
Mom used to say that he came here
with only two jars of pickles.

1541
01:26:39,958 --> 01:26:41,375
He started pawnbroking.

1542
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:42,792
Now he's rich on the interest.

1543
01:26:42,958 --> 01:26:44,750
It's our money, we’re taking it back!

1544
01:26:44,833 --> 01:26:47,125
Technically, it's not theft.
It's our birth right!

1545
01:26:47,208 --> 01:26:48,625
[Vasanth] The GPS is changing.

1546
01:26:48,708 --> 01:26:50,500
[Gaaji] The northie’s house is that way.
Turn back!

1547
01:26:50,750 --> 01:26:53,250
Don't think! Just turn around!

1548
01:26:53,417 --> 01:26:56,542
Get off and pull, you boulder!

1549
01:26:56,750 --> 01:26:59,333
Be brave, Thooyava!

1550
01:27:00,958 --> 01:27:03,708
In a few minutes, he'll lock up
his shop and go upstairs to eat lunch.

1551
01:27:03,792 --> 01:27:05,208
We'll follow him.

1552
01:27:05,292 --> 01:27:07,667
He's just a bloody northie.
Show him a knife, he'll pee his pants.

1553
01:27:07,792 --> 01:27:10,083
Then we take the money and leave.

1554
01:27:10,375 --> 01:27:14,667
Why not break into his shop
after he leaves?

1555
01:27:14,958 --> 01:27:17,333
He always takes the money with him.

1556
01:27:18,125 --> 01:27:20,125
[Vasanth]
How on earth do you know all this?

1557
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,708
Last year I had a similar plan.
It fizzled out.

1558
01:27:24,375 --> 01:27:26,292
I'm sure it was for a girl!

1559
01:27:26,417 --> 01:27:27,583
Who's the babe?

1560
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:29,417
-Tell me! Spill it!
-[Thooyavan] Shut up, buddy.

1561
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:31,875
Tell me, man!

1562
01:27:33,292 --> 01:27:35,625
-Hey, tell me.
-Gaaji. No!

1563
01:27:35,958 --> 01:27:37,667
I've been wanting
to get this off my chest, too.

1564
01:27:41,792 --> 01:27:42,958
Place it properly over my heart.

1565
01:27:43,750 --> 01:27:45,667
Dude! I’m in love with your sister!

1566
01:27:45,750 --> 01:27:47,958
-How the fuck can you do that?
-Hey, hey, stop!

1567
01:27:48,083 --> 01:27:50,208
Why is loving a friend’s
sister such a big crime?

1568
01:27:50,292 --> 01:27:52,083
-Fuck off! You don’t even have a sister!
-Hey, man!

1569
01:27:52,208 --> 01:27:53,875
-True. You only have a brother!
-Leave, man!

1570
01:27:54,042 --> 01:27:55,458
-Let him go!
-Spare the ears,

1571
01:27:55,542 --> 01:27:56,833
-it's your sister's favorite.
-Guys!

1572
01:27:56,917 --> 01:27:58,375
-Don't fight!
-[Vasanth] What did you say?

1573
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:00,750
-We need to buy two TVs by tonight!
-[Gaaji] Let go of me!

1574
01:28:00,833 --> 01:28:02,375
[Vasanth] How can you lust
over my sister?

1575
01:28:02,458 --> 01:28:04,500
-[Gaaji] Lust is the mother of true love.
-[Vasanth grunts]

1576
01:28:04,583 --> 01:28:06,792
Hey! The northie is leaving.

1577
01:28:07,208 --> 01:28:09,208
[light music]

1578
01:28:18,667 --> 01:28:20,667
[light music continues]

1579
01:28:26,042 --> 01:28:27,375
[Gaaji] Come on, dude!

1580
01:28:27,542 --> 01:28:28,542
I’m scared.

1581
01:28:30,292 --> 01:28:31,292
[Thooyavan] Just come on!

1582
01:28:35,583 --> 01:28:37,667
-[Vaembu] Will it work?
-[Mugil] Yeah!

1583
01:28:37,750 --> 01:28:39,208
Pretty soon, the train will hit the jeep.

1584
01:28:39,292 --> 01:28:41,042
It will look like an accident.

1585
01:28:41,792 --> 01:28:44,208
You know our lazy cops
and their hasty autopsies.

1586
01:28:44,542 --> 01:28:45,583
We're safe.

1587
01:28:46,542 --> 01:28:47,458
Are you sure?

1588
01:28:48,125 --> 01:28:49,250
Yes.

1589
01:28:53,667 --> 01:28:55,542
-Why hasn’t the train come yet?
-[helicopter whirring]

1590
01:28:57,125 --> 01:28:58,042
I’ll go find out.

1591
01:28:58,167 --> 01:28:59,750
-No wait! I’ll go.
-No, I’ll go.

1592
01:29:04,875 --> 01:29:05,750
Ew.

1593
01:29:15,708 --> 01:29:16,958
It's going to take two hours.

1594
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:21,542
Until then, what will we do
with the corpse in the back?

1595
01:29:24,083 --> 01:29:25,083
I’m hungry.

1596
01:29:27,542 --> 01:29:28,792
Me, too.

1597
01:29:33,917 --> 01:29:35,042
[Mugil] I’ll go buy food.

1598
01:29:35,125 --> 01:29:37,792
[Vaembu] No, I'll go.
I can't be alone with this thing.

1599
01:29:38,417 --> 01:29:39,583
"This thing?"

1600
01:29:40,333 --> 01:29:43,917
Remember what you were doing
with "this thing" earlier?

1601
01:29:50,958 --> 01:29:52,083
Pooris for you?

1602
01:29:52,375 --> 01:29:54,083
-[Mugil] No, Idli.
-Okay!

1603
01:30:00,792 --> 01:30:05,750
[Mugil] I am living with her,
and yet she has no idea what I’ll eat.

1604
01:30:07,625 --> 01:30:10,333
But she accurately guesses
your phone password!

1605
01:30:16,667 --> 01:30:18,833
Can you fucking believe this?

1606
01:30:20,042 --> 01:30:21,083
You come to my house,

1607
01:30:21,542 --> 01:30:22,667
fuck my wife,

1608
01:30:23,292 --> 01:30:25,542
in my bed,

1609
01:30:26,167 --> 01:30:28,167
and now you're happily chilling with me!

1610
01:30:29,333 --> 01:30:31,250
Fucking Casanova’s balls of love.

1611
01:30:45,208 --> 01:30:46,375
Why you are like this?

1612
01:30:47,875 --> 01:30:49,375
You dated in college, it's fine.

1613
01:30:50,208 --> 01:30:51,625
But now she's fucking married!

1614
01:30:52,083 --> 01:30:53,250
Shouldn't you have stayed away?

1615
01:30:55,667 --> 01:30:56,917
Imagine this...

1616
01:30:57,583 --> 01:30:59,208
You come back home one evening,

1617
01:30:59,417 --> 01:31:01,208
and I'm fucking your wife in your bed!

1618
01:31:01,292 --> 01:31:02,417
How would you feel?

1619
01:31:04,875 --> 01:31:07,167
Whether or not you love your wife,
wouldn’t it still hurt?

1620
01:31:08,333 --> 01:31:09,750
Do you know how much it hurts?

1621
01:31:10,917 --> 01:31:12,500
I really liked her a lot.

1622
01:31:15,625 --> 01:31:16,542
[sighs]

1623
01:31:17,917 --> 01:31:19,917
Do you guys even think of consequences?

1624
01:31:21,583 --> 01:31:23,333
[Mugil] What the F....

1625
01:31:25,167 --> 01:31:26,083
Fucker!

1626
01:31:26,542 --> 01:31:28,000
You were at my wedding!

1627
01:31:28,125 --> 01:31:31,167
You shook my hand
and said "Happy married life, Boss!"

1628
01:31:31,250 --> 01:31:32,125
without batting an eye!

1629
01:31:33,625 --> 01:31:36,333
What is it that you have, that I don't?

1630
01:31:49,208 --> 01:31:51,792
[Mugil] Let this just be between us.

1631
01:31:51,875 --> 01:31:53,042
[clear throats]

1632
01:31:57,667 --> 01:31:58,625
What took you so long?

1633
01:31:58,958 --> 01:32:00,667
[Vaembu] ATM was out of cash.

1634
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,292
Did they give back 250 Rupees?

1635
01:32:04,833 --> 01:32:05,833
What?

1636
01:32:06,292 --> 01:32:09,750
If a check bounces,
the bank charges 250 Rupees.

1637
01:32:09,958 --> 01:32:13,000
So, if an ATM runs out of cash,
shouldn't they pay us 250?

1638
01:32:15,333 --> 01:32:16,333
The whole system sucks!

1639
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,792
Run a light,
and you have to pay 100 Rupees.

1640
01:32:20,042 --> 01:32:22,667
When a light doesn't work,
shouldn't they pay us?

1641
01:32:22,792 --> 01:32:24,833
They won’t. The fuckwads.

1642
01:32:25,583 --> 01:32:27,583
What's with all the angst?

1643
01:32:28,417 --> 01:32:29,333
I’m going to be an actor.

1644
01:32:29,542 --> 01:32:33,583
Maybe I’ll be known as
revolutionary "something" Mugil.

1645
01:32:34,042 --> 01:32:35,125
Then I'll enter politics.

1646
01:32:35,583 --> 01:32:36,958
Politics is where the real acting is.

1647
01:32:38,583 --> 01:32:41,208
You're pretty relaxed for a man
with a dead body in the back.

1648
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:45,375
At first, it freaked me out too.

1649
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,625
But now I’m warming up to the idea.

1650
01:32:47,708 --> 01:32:48,542
[chuckles softly]

1651
01:32:48,667 --> 01:32:50,250
With time, one gets
comfortable with anything.

1652
01:32:52,583 --> 01:32:54,000
We stayed together for so long.

1653
01:32:54,750 --> 01:32:56,375
Why haven’t we warmed
up to the idea of us?

1654
01:33:02,458 --> 01:33:03,958
No problem, ma’am.

1655
01:33:04,750 --> 01:33:05,833
Don’t worry.

1656
01:33:06,333 --> 01:33:07,542
I'll send them.

1657
01:33:10,792 --> 01:33:14,792
Next time you take your son out,
take a normal person along.

1658
01:33:14,958 --> 01:33:16,542
Understood? Go.

1659
01:33:23,708 --> 01:33:24,708
Hmm.

1660
01:33:27,375 --> 01:33:28,417
Good morning, sir.

1661
01:33:31,375 --> 01:33:33,333
What seems to be the problem?

1662
01:33:33,833 --> 01:33:35,333
I had my suspicions, so I brought them in.

1663
01:33:35,458 --> 01:33:36,875
But then I called and inquired.

1664
01:33:36,958 --> 01:33:39,250
That boy is "it’s" son.
After all, it was just a misunderstanding.

1665
01:33:39,833 --> 01:33:41,042
Inquired on the phone?

1666
01:33:42,333 --> 01:33:44,667
Who gave the number? This one, right?

1667
01:33:45,167 --> 01:33:46,458
What if it was a ploy?

1668
01:33:47,458 --> 01:33:49,208
Is this how you do your duty?

1669
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:52,333
Go and investigate in person.

1670
01:33:52,417 --> 01:33:53,917
Sir, please!

1671
01:33:54,125 --> 01:33:56,833
It would look bad if a cop visit
my house the day I arrived.

1672
01:33:56,958 --> 01:33:58,292
Shut the fuck up!

1673
01:33:58,375 --> 01:34:00,833
Are you teaching me how
to do my job? Be quiet!

1674
01:34:01,208 --> 01:34:02,542
You carry on, Head Constable.

1675
01:34:02,625 --> 01:34:03,667
Sir.

1676
01:34:08,042 --> 01:34:11,500
Look, he’s changing
into plain clothes for your sake.

1677
01:34:16,333 --> 01:34:17,958
Heart of gold, eh?

1678
01:34:34,625 --> 01:34:37,875
I need to discuss
something important with you.

1679
01:34:38,833 --> 01:34:40,042
[chuckles]

1680
01:34:40,208 --> 01:34:41,208
Why don’t you come in?

1681
01:34:41,667 --> 01:34:42,542
Sir?

1682
01:34:43,875 --> 01:34:49,167
The shock on your face makes me wonder
if I may be doing something terrible?

1683
01:34:51,583 --> 01:34:52,458
Wow!

1684
01:34:53,167 --> 01:34:55,375
You've got killer expressions!

1685
01:34:57,458 --> 01:35:01,500
I desperately need to talk to you,
for ten minutes at least.

1686
01:35:01,583 --> 01:35:02,875
Eh? Eh?

1687
01:35:03,167 --> 01:35:04,042
Sir, have mercy.

1688
01:35:05,125 --> 01:35:07,417
How can you say these things
when my son is right here?

1689
01:35:09,333 --> 01:35:11,208
Do I have to take care
of everything myself?

1690
01:35:11,750 --> 01:35:13,208
Ekambaram, come here.

1691
01:35:14,042 --> 01:35:16,375
Take this boy to the tea shop.

1692
01:35:16,833 --> 01:35:19,250
Tell them that "respected"
officer Berlin sent you.

1693
01:35:19,542 --> 01:35:20,500
You'll say that, right?

1694
01:35:21,500 --> 01:35:22,417
Yes, sir.

1695
01:35:22,625 --> 01:35:24,875
Tell them that officer sent you
to buy tea and coconut biscuits.

1696
01:35:25,042 --> 01:35:25,917
Little fellow!

1697
01:35:26,083 --> 01:35:29,458
Tea and biscuits in that shop
are delicious.

1698
01:35:29,542 --> 01:35:33,208
You're in for such a treat!

1699
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,250
It's divine!

1700
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:39,458
You can have two, even three at your age.

1701
01:35:40,125 --> 01:35:42,500
You have to enjoy it slowly.

1702
01:35:42,583 --> 01:35:44,167
Only then will your body absorb it.

1703
01:35:45,333 --> 01:35:46,208
By the way,

1704
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:49,208
if this uncle speaks disrespectfully
about me,

1705
01:35:49,708 --> 01:35:52,083
-you have to tell me.
-Mm-hmm.

1706
01:35:54,708 --> 01:35:55,708
Run along, sweetie.

1707
01:36:02,917 --> 01:36:03,750
Hey!

1708
01:36:04,292 --> 01:36:05,333
You, too.

1709
01:36:05,833 --> 01:36:07,250
Have a cup of tea!

1710
01:36:10,208 --> 01:36:11,708
[Raasu Kutti] Biscuit for dad?

1711
01:36:11,792 --> 01:36:14,458
Huh?
[laughs]

1712
01:36:15,042 --> 01:36:17,292
I have other biscuits for your dad.

1713
01:36:17,375 --> 01:36:18,792
Go, go.

1714
01:36:19,417 --> 01:36:20,250

I always wanted to stay in shape,

1728
01:36:57,042 --> 01:36:59,792

What if someone comes?

1744
01:37:39,208 --> 01:37:41,000
Shouldn’t cops always be on guard?

1745

Our motto claims,
"The police are your friend."

1746

Won't they be my friend?

Why do you sit like that? Such innocence!

1774
01:39:28,083 --> 01:39:30,333
Innocence is always a huge turn-on.

Get on your knees, buttercup.

When I am not hesitant to give,

1780
01:39:44,250 --> 01:39:46,375
why are you reluctant to take?

1781
01:39:47,167 --> 01:39:49,000
The logic beats me!

Whoa, man!

1783
01:39:51,542 --> 01:39:54,167
I may be shameless,

but the desire to see a
respected senior officer in the act

Yes.

I was killing myself
trying to impress you.

1800
01:41:06,875 --> 01:41:07,792
In your case,

1801
01:41:07,958 --> 01:41:12,042
you were pressured into
an arranged marriage

1802
01:41:12,125 --> 01:41:13,292
against your will.

1803
01:41:14,542 --> 01:41:15,500
But now it’s different.

1804

We know it’ll be over soon.

After you shower, the bathroom floor

I've cut down on shopping
since the marriage.

1826

You hate my cooking.

1827

01:46:57,667 --> 01:46:59,250
Pay the advance.

1894
01:46:59,708 --> 01:47:01,208
I don’t have the advance amount right now.

1895
01:47:01,417 --> 01:47:03,292
Send someone home to get it.

1896
01:47:03,583 --> 01:47:05,250
There’s no money at home, either.

1897
01:47:06,208 --> 01:47:07,417
Do you have insurance?

1898
01:47:07,792 --> 01:47:10,875
-We can’t afford insurance, doctor.
-Seems uncertain.

1899
01:47:10,958 --> 01:47:13,500
-There will be many expenses--
-Wait!

1900
01:47:13,625 --> 01:47:15,083
Mohan! Come here!

1901
01:47:15,167 --> 01:47:16,667
Won't you help your friend?

1902
01:47:16,792 --> 01:47:18,667
-You’ll stay here, right?
-He'll stay.

1903
01:47:18,750 --> 01:47:21,250
Keep him as collateral
for two or three days, until I pay.

1904
01:47:21,458 --> 01:47:22,792
-Please start the surgery!
-No, ma'am.

1905
01:47:22,875 --> 01:47:24,208
It may be too expensive for you.

1906
01:47:24,292 --> 01:47:26,500
-Better rush him to a government hospital.
-It's too late!

1907
01:47:26,583 --> 01:47:28,833
There's too much traffic!
All the roads are packed.

1908
01:47:29,417 --> 01:47:31,750
What if something happens to him
before we reach a public hospital?

1909
01:47:31,833 --> 01:47:33,333
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

1910
01:47:33,500 --> 01:47:34,708
You just brought him in.

1911
01:47:34,833 --> 01:47:35,875
We had to examine him,

1912
01:47:35,958 --> 01:47:38,083
figure out the costs and all.

1913
01:47:38,167 --> 01:47:39,167
Don't waste another minute!

1914
01:47:39,250 --> 01:47:40,375
-[flatline tone]
-Just start now!

1915
01:47:40,458 --> 01:47:41,875
-[patient screaming]
-[Leela gasps]

1916
01:47:43,375 --> 01:47:44,708
Move away!

1917
01:47:44,792 --> 01:47:46,083
-Clear the space!
-Soori!

1918
01:47:46,167 --> 01:47:47,375
Save him, Lord!

1919
01:47:47,458 --> 01:47:48,667
-Soori!
-[doctor 2] Call the nurse.

1920
01:47:48,875 --> 01:47:50,625
-I’m here.
-Rush me the reports!

1921
01:47:50,708 --> 01:47:53,250
-I know it hurts. Just grin and bear it.
-Save him, dear Lord!

1922
01:47:53,333 --> 01:47:55,083
-What are you doing?
-Mom will save you, for sure!

1923
01:47:55,167 --> 01:47:56,083
Doctor, doctor!

1924
01:47:56,167 --> 01:47:58,208
[doctor 2] <i>Go and attend
the patient, quick. Who is inside?</i>

1925
01:47:59,833 --> 01:48:00,875
Take these!

1926
01:48:00,958 --> 01:48:02,500
Please start the surgery!

1927
01:48:02,875 --> 01:48:05,458
-Meenal, bring Soori!
-[doctor 2] Please listen to me, ma'am.

1928
01:48:05,542 --> 01:48:06,917
Please start the procedure!

1929
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,958
I don't have a problem.
I can do the surgery for free!

1930
01:48:10,125 --> 01:48:13,167
But there are other charges,
like medicine, the operating room, and...

1931
01:48:13,333 --> 01:48:15,750
-Medicine, medicine...
-Dear Lord!

1932
01:48:15,833 --> 01:48:17,375
Sir, you know me!

1933
01:48:17,500 --> 01:48:20,708
I live above Jabbar’s house!
I'm sure you’ve seen me.

1934
01:48:20,792 --> 01:48:22,458
Please give him the medicine.

1935
01:48:22,625 --> 01:48:25,500
I swear on my life, I'll pay you back!

1936
01:48:25,583 --> 01:48:26,958
-Please! Please!
-Madam!

1937
01:48:28,667 --> 01:48:31,167
-Yes, at Ward 3. Wait a minute.
-Doctor!

1938
01:48:31,292 --> 01:48:32,375
Doctor!

1939
01:48:32,458 --> 01:48:33,708
I'll sell you my kidney.

1940
01:48:33,792 --> 01:48:35,208
I'm sure it's worth something.

1941
01:48:35,500 --> 01:48:37,833
When you find a tissue match, I'll donate!

1942
01:48:38,042 --> 01:48:39,875
I won’t cheat. You are saving my son--

1943
01:48:39,958 --> 01:48:42,333
Madam! This is not that kind of hospital!

1944
01:48:43,292 --> 01:48:45,792
Look at the commotion you're causing.

1945
01:48:46,208 --> 01:48:47,500
Nurse, you go to the ward.

1946
01:48:47,958 --> 01:48:50,292
Oh god! There are so many of you here.

1947
01:48:50,375 --> 01:48:52,458
Can't one of you help me with the money?

1948
01:48:52,667 --> 01:48:57,750
If each of you will give me even
100 or 200 Rupees, I can save him!

1949
01:48:58,167 --> 01:49:01,708
If the situation was reversed,
I would have definitely contributed

1950
01:49:01,875 --> 01:49:05,375
to my very last penny!

1951
01:49:06,333 --> 01:49:07,333
Hmm.

1952
01:49:07,542 --> 01:49:08,917
This is exactly what I do, too.

1953
01:49:09,167 --> 01:49:10,417
You are begging people.

1954
01:49:10,625 --> 01:49:11,958
I'm begging the Lord!

1955
01:49:12,250 --> 01:49:13,833
You pray for your child alone!

1956
01:49:14,042 --> 01:49:15,458
I would pray for anyone's child!

1957
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:18,125
Come! Come and embrace my god!

1958
01:49:18,583 --> 01:49:19,958
-[grunts]
-[thuds]

1959
01:49:20,583 --> 01:49:23,208
Have you lost your fucking mind?

1960
01:49:23,667 --> 01:49:26,333
Half a century on earth,
but not a bit of common sense!

1961
01:49:26,583 --> 01:49:27,500
[groans]

1962
01:49:28,417 --> 01:49:31,042
Is this the time for sermons?

1963
01:49:31,125 --> 01:49:33,458
[sobbing]

1964
01:49:33,542 --> 01:49:36,917
I wouldn’t even be
in this position, if it wasn't for you.

1965
01:49:38,417 --> 01:49:41,875
Can’t you see? We need money, Dhanasekar.

1966
01:49:41,958 --> 01:49:43,417
Go, get money, Dhanasekar!

1967
01:49:44,250 --> 01:49:46,167
Meenal! Please do something!

1968
01:49:46,667 --> 01:49:48,542
Sorry, sorry, doctor.

1969
01:49:48,917 --> 01:49:51,667
I really want to help,
but I don't have the authority.

1970
01:49:51,750 --> 01:49:53,250
Then who does?

1971
01:49:53,333 --> 01:49:54,833
-The chief doctor.
-What’s his name?

1972
01:49:54,917 --> 01:49:56,917
-MS Vishwanath. He is in the main block.
-MSV. Where’s he?

1973
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,542
-No, go that way. He'll help.
-Please start the surgery!

1974
01:50:00,792 --> 01:50:03,458
Dhanashekar! What are you waiting for?

1975
01:50:03,542 --> 01:50:05,292
Go get the money!

1976
01:50:05,792 --> 01:50:07,458
Meenal! Do something!

1977
01:50:07,583 --> 01:50:08,708
[Leela] Do something!

1978
01:50:56,917 --> 01:50:57,833
[purrs]

1979
01:51:08,958 --> 01:51:10,125
Banzai!

1980
01:51:19,250 --> 01:51:20,167
Dude!

1981
01:51:20,250 --> 01:51:21,250
Gaaji!

1982
01:51:21,458 --> 01:51:22,458
Hey, Gaaji!

1983
01:51:22,625 --> 01:51:24,833
-Wake the hell up!
-Got the money?

1984
01:51:24,917 --> 01:51:25,875
Yeah!

1985
01:51:25,958 --> 01:51:27,792
You just fucked yourself, dude!

1986
01:51:27,875 --> 01:51:28,792
Oh, shut up!

1987
01:51:31,625 --> 01:51:33,125
Hey, Egg Muffin!

1988
01:51:33,333 --> 01:51:35,375
Look at the lazy bastard!
How irresponsible!

1989
01:51:35,500 --> 01:51:37,750
Wake him up, Thooyavan. It's getting late.

1990
01:51:38,375 --> 01:51:39,708
Wake up!

1991
01:51:40,667 --> 01:51:42,333
-Dude, did you get the money?
-Yeah, come fast!

1992
01:51:42,917 --> 01:51:44,208
You just fucked yourself, dude!

1993
01:51:44,333 --> 01:51:45,500
Hey! I did it!

1994
01:51:45,583 --> 01:51:47,333
-Yes!
-Wait, wait, wait!

1995
01:51:47,417 --> 01:51:49,000
Let's take that chair. It's so cool.

1996
01:51:49,083 --> 01:51:50,458
Move it, Cheeseball!

1997
01:51:56,083 --> 01:51:58,167
[upbeat music on TV]

1998
01:52:05,708 --> 01:52:06,917
Buddy!

1999
01:52:08,042 --> 01:52:09,125
What’s this?

2000
01:52:18,917 --> 01:52:21,625
It's demonetized money. Worthless!

2001
01:52:21,833 --> 01:52:23,125
The northie cheated us!

2002
01:52:23,625 --> 01:52:25,417
-These are the invalid old notes.
-What the fuck?

2003
01:52:28,083 --> 01:52:29,417
Let's go back again.

2004
01:52:30,208 --> 01:52:31,083
Why?

2005
01:52:31,417 --> 01:52:33,333
I saw some more money in the drawer.

2006
01:52:33,500 --> 01:52:35,208
Then why didn’t you take
it in the first place?

2007
01:52:35,292 --> 01:52:37,083
We didn’t need that much, dude.

2008
01:52:38,917 --> 01:52:40,333
Why, dude?

2009
01:52:43,167 --> 01:52:45,167
Dude! I’m scared.

2010
01:52:45,417 --> 01:52:46,833
We did it once, we escaped.

2011
01:52:47,208 --> 01:52:48,667
No way we’ll get that lucky again.

2012
01:52:48,958 --> 01:52:50,875
It-la won't-la work-la out-la, dude.

2013
01:52:53,667 --> 01:52:56,292
If both of you believe
that this is a bad choice,

2014
01:52:56,458 --> 01:52:59,667
then that's the only choice. Let's go.

2015
01:52:59,792 --> 01:53:01,833
Therein lies our salvation.

2016
01:53:02,583 --> 01:53:04,583
[Raasu Kutti] This is really my dad!

2017
01:53:04,708 --> 01:53:07,042
[guard] This thing can’t be your father.

2018
01:53:07,125 --> 01:53:10,375
[Raasu Kutti] No, this is my dad!
My grandma told me!

2019
01:53:10,500 --> 01:53:11,833
-[Shilpa] One moment...
-Keep quiet!

2020
01:53:11,917 --> 01:53:15,083
Even if this thing is your dad,

2021
01:53:15,250 --> 01:53:17,083
I can't let "it" in.

2022
01:53:17,208 --> 01:53:19,250
I'll get fired for sure.

2023
01:53:19,625 --> 01:53:21,500
If you really want "it" to get in,

2024
01:53:21,583 --> 01:53:23,250
get a written note from your teacher.

2025
01:53:23,667 --> 01:53:25,208
Then I’ll let "it" in.

2026
01:53:25,333 --> 01:53:27,667
You wait here. I’ll bring my friends.

2027
01:53:27,750 --> 01:53:30,500
I brought you here only for them
to see you.

2028
01:53:30,833 --> 01:53:33,292
Please put on your sunglasses. Act cool!

2029
01:53:42,917 --> 01:53:43,833
Dude!

2030
01:53:43,917 --> 01:53:47,042
What comes before Tran-F,
but after Tran-D?

2031
01:53:47,208 --> 01:53:48,417
Tran-E!

2032
01:53:48,500 --> 01:53:51,792
What's a tranny?

2033
01:53:51,875 --> 01:53:53,250
Keep quiet!

2034
01:53:53,792 --> 01:53:56,917
[student] If a tranny were
to write to you,

2035
01:53:57,167 --> 01:53:59,208
what would she use?

2036
01:53:59,375 --> 01:54:01,708
She-mail!

2037
01:54:01,792 --> 01:54:03,375
-[student 2] Good one!
-[student 3] Good one!

2038
01:54:03,458 --> 01:54:05,917
Are they also called she-males, Dad?

2039
01:54:06,083 --> 01:54:07,417
Shut it!

2040
01:54:08,167 --> 01:54:11,083
It's very presence is
provoking the children.

2041
01:54:11,750 --> 01:54:12,750
Ask "it" to leave!

2042
01:54:12,875 --> 01:54:15,542
"It" just won't leave.

2043
01:54:15,958 --> 01:54:18,083
It claims to be the father of a student.

2044
01:54:18,292 --> 01:54:20,333
Why don’t you just leave?

2045
01:54:21,208 --> 01:54:22,875
Sir, I’m waiting for my son.

2046
01:54:23,042 --> 01:54:25,958
Leave now!
The local sub-inspector is my friend.

2047
01:54:26,667 --> 01:54:28,042
He may be your friend,

2048
01:54:28,292 --> 01:54:29,917
but he’s like my husband.

2049
01:54:31,208 --> 01:54:33,292
We just consummated our relationship.

2050
01:54:35,167 --> 01:54:37,375
What’s consummated?

2051
01:54:37,625 --> 01:54:40,833
-Shut up and come on!
-[guard] Consummation, huh?

2052
01:54:41,542 --> 01:54:43,500
[student 3] Look at the beauty of "it"!

2053
01:54:43,583 --> 01:54:46,750
[guard] Why are you dragging
"it" in again?

2054
01:54:47,083 --> 01:54:49,708
-Is that really your son?
-[scoffs]

2055
01:54:52,750 --> 01:54:53,625
Yes, granny.

2056
01:54:54,792 --> 01:54:58,083
How many battles will you fight every day?

2057
01:54:58,333 --> 01:55:01,500
Do you think your poor boy
will have a normal life?

2058
01:55:02,875 --> 01:55:04,083
What wrong have I done?

2059
01:55:04,375 --> 01:55:05,542
Don't we cut our nails?

2060
01:55:05,667 --> 01:55:07,167
Don't we cut our hair to suit our taste?

2061
01:55:07,250 --> 01:55:08,583
Similarly, I altered my body a bit.

2062
01:55:09,583 --> 01:55:11,208
Where's the crime in that?

2063
01:55:11,583 --> 01:55:13,625
It sounds reasonable,

2064
01:55:13,917 --> 01:55:16,375
but they threw you out.

2065
01:55:16,667 --> 01:55:17,542
That's the point.

2066
01:55:17,750 --> 01:55:18,792
Reasoning is one thing,

2067
01:55:18,958 --> 01:55:20,208
reality is another.

2068
01:55:36,958 --> 01:55:38,958
One train ticket to Bombay tomorrow.

2069
01:55:42,125 --> 01:55:43,042
Return ticket?

2070
01:55:44,958 --> 01:55:46,167
Return, madam?

2071
01:55:46,958 --> 01:55:47,833
No return.

2072
01:55:53,583 --> 01:55:55,875
I asked him to wait here. He's missing.

2073
01:55:55,958 --> 01:55:58,042
<i>-Three times two is six.
-Three times two is six.</i>

2074
01:55:59,083 --> 01:56:01,583
-<i>Four times two is eight.</i>
-Hey, where is he?

2075
01:56:02,333 --> 01:56:04,333
Test-tube baby is lying!

2076
01:56:04,625 --> 01:56:06,583
He doesn't have a father.

2077
01:56:08,833 --> 01:56:09,708
Sunil!

2078
01:56:09,792 --> 01:56:12,167
That’s my dad!
Coming out of your dad’s shop.

2079
01:56:12,250 --> 01:56:13,667
Come on, let's see!

2080
01:56:15,250 --> 01:56:16,792
-What are you saying, dude?
-[laughing]

2081
01:56:16,875 --> 01:56:18,167
That's your dad?

2082
01:56:18,250 --> 01:56:19,583
Oh, yeah!

2083
01:56:19,667 --> 01:56:21,125
Why is he wearing a saree?

2084
01:56:21,208 --> 01:56:23,083
That’s his style, dude.

2085
01:56:23,208 --> 01:56:24,750
[Raasu Kutti] Why are you laughing?

2086
01:56:24,875 --> 01:56:27,125
Have I ever laughed at your dad?

2087
01:56:27,292 --> 01:56:30,208
[boy 2] My dad looks like a dad.
Your dad looks like a mom!

2088
01:56:30,500 --> 01:56:32,792
Why can’t dads look like moms?

2089
01:56:32,958 --> 01:56:34,458
Guys, please wait!

2090
01:56:34,667 --> 01:56:37,042
My dad came all the way to see you both.

2091
01:56:37,333 --> 01:56:39,417
[boy 3] Our tutor was right about him.

2092
01:56:39,708 --> 01:56:41,333
He’s surely a test-tube baby.

2093
01:56:41,500 --> 01:56:43,250
Just don’t say that.

2094
01:56:43,417 --> 01:56:44,583
We so will.

2095
01:56:44,708 --> 01:56:47,375
-Test-tube baby!
-Test-tube baby!

2096
01:56:47,458 --> 01:56:49,583
-Test-tube baby!
-Test-tube baby!

2097
01:56:49,667 --> 01:56:50,833
[yells]

2098
01:56:50,917 --> 01:56:52,292
-Test-tube baby!
-Test-tube baby!

2099
01:56:52,375 --> 01:56:54,417
Bite his ear! Don't leave him!

2100
01:56:54,500 --> 01:56:56,083
Bite his ear!

2101
01:56:56,167 --> 01:56:57,625
Pull him this way!

2102
01:56:57,708 --> 01:56:59,750
Bite his ear!

2103
01:56:59,833 --> 01:57:01,875
-Punch him!
-Hey, keep quiet!

2104
01:57:01,958 --> 01:57:04,083
Raasu Kutti, don’t fight!

2105
01:57:04,167 --> 01:57:06,000
Hey, children! Boys!

2106
01:57:06,208 --> 01:57:07,917
Nonsense! What is...

2107
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:09,875
What’s going on here? Bloody what is...

2108
01:57:09,958 --> 01:57:11,958
I repeatedly told that thing to leave,

2109
01:57:12,167 --> 01:57:14,917
-"it" just won't leave.
-Hey, get out now!

2110
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,250
-Sir, he wanted me to meet his friends.
-Go, go, go!

2111
01:57:17,458 --> 01:57:19,542
-No sir my son wanted me...
-Go, go, go!

2112
01:57:19,667 --> 01:57:21,542
-to meet his friends.
-Go, go, go.

2113
01:57:21,667 --> 01:57:23,458
-Sir, I won't come back here.
-Go, go, go!

2114
01:57:23,667 --> 01:57:26,417
-Please just hear me out.
-Go, go, go!

2115
01:57:26,625 --> 01:57:28,000
-Sir, just listen for a moment!
-Go, go!

2116
01:57:28,208 --> 01:57:30,208
-For one moment!
-Go, go, go!

2117
01:57:30,333 --> 01:57:31,708
-Go!
-Sir!

2118
01:57:31,792 --> 01:57:33,042
-Go, go!
-Sir, just once, sir.

2119
01:57:33,250 --> 01:57:35,208
-Go, go, go!
-Just a moment, sir!

2120
01:57:35,750 --> 01:57:38,083
-Go means go!
-Please, sir.

2121
01:57:38,333 --> 01:57:39,792
-Get out now.
-Please consider, sir.

2122
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:41,375
Go, go, go.

2123
01:57:41,583 --> 01:57:43,042
Go...

2124
01:57:44,542 --> 01:57:46,292
-Sorry, sir!
-[grunts]

2125
01:58:05,167 --> 01:58:07,208
-[worker 1] Can you hold it properly?
-[worker 2] Yes.

2126
01:58:07,292 --> 01:58:11,125
[worker 1] Keep it and come back sooner.
Don't waste time using your phone.

2127
01:58:13,042 --> 01:58:15,292
My mouth feels icky.

2128
01:58:15,458 --> 01:58:16,750
I’ll get a beeda.

2129
01:58:20,292 --> 01:58:21,792
One sweet beeda please.

2130
01:58:21,958 --> 01:58:22,958
40 Rupees.

2131
01:58:25,792 --> 01:58:27,917
You should never try these vices.

2132
01:58:30,375 --> 01:58:32,875
Always listen to your mom and grandma.

2133
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:36,625
When you grow up,
you shouldn't chew tobacco,

2134
01:58:37,375 --> 01:58:39,417
you shouldn't smoke.

2135
01:58:40,333 --> 01:58:42,250
Never think of doing these things.

2136
01:58:45,917 --> 01:58:47,875
Yes, I understood.
You mind your own business.

2137
01:58:47,958 --> 01:58:51,708
Don't complicate things...

2138
01:58:51,875 --> 01:58:54,958
Buy some peanuts!

2139
01:58:55,292 --> 01:59:00,750
Peanuts! Peanuts!

2140
01:59:04,625 --> 01:59:06,042
Study hard.

2141
01:59:07,250 --> 01:59:08,625
Get a good job.

2142
01:59:11,167 --> 01:59:13,750
Earn the respect of other people.

2143
01:59:17,708 --> 01:59:20,458
Live exactly how the world wants you to.

2144
01:59:22,458 --> 01:59:25,292
[Shilpa] Don't think originally.
Don't be unique.

2145
01:59:25,958 --> 01:59:27,583
Blend with the crowd.

2146
01:59:27,750 --> 01:59:30,000
Uniqueness is feared by the world.

2147
01:59:30,083 --> 01:59:33,667
Fear leads to hatred,
and the world will not be let you be.

2148
01:59:40,083 --> 01:59:42,792
-Raasu Kutti!
-Please, bro!

2149
01:59:42,875 --> 01:59:44,500
Raasu Kutti!

2150
01:59:47,958 --> 01:59:50,667
[man 9] You can do it for sure.
He'll listen to you.

2151
01:59:50,750 --> 01:59:52,292
Have you seen a little boy?

2152
01:59:52,500 --> 01:59:53,917
Raasu Kutti!

2153
02:00:00,583 --> 02:00:02,250
Raasu Kutti!

2154
02:00:05,125 --> 02:00:06,917
Have you seen a young boy
in a green shirt?

2155
02:00:09,667 --> 02:00:11,208
Raasu Kutti!

2156
02:00:18,333 --> 02:00:20,917
Sir, did you see the boy who was with me?

2157
02:00:21,083 --> 02:00:22,458
Lost the child?

2158
02:00:22,542 --> 02:00:24,417
Go find him. Go, go!

2159
02:00:24,500 --> 02:00:26,250
[vendor] Which idiot trusted
you with their kid?

2160
02:00:26,333 --> 02:00:27,208
Raasu Kutti!

2161
02:00:27,292 --> 02:00:30,542
-Raasu Kutti! Raasu Kutti! Raasu Kutti!
-[worker 2] There is a lot of work ahead!

2162
02:00:30,667 --> 02:00:34,250
Why are you wasting time
on your phone? Move it fast!

2163
02:00:34,917 --> 02:00:36,458
Have you seen a child?

2164
02:00:37,125 --> 02:00:39,292
Wow! I can help you
have a child if you like.

2165
02:00:39,375 --> 02:00:40,208
[chuckles]

2166
02:00:40,292 --> 02:00:43,375
[man 9] Awesome, dude. There's nothing
wrong in asking.

2167
02:00:43,667 --> 02:00:47,208
[man 10] One shouldn't die with
an unfulfilled desire in his heart.

2168
02:00:47,333 --> 02:00:50,333
-[vendor 2] Buy some flowers!
-[vendor 3] Yeah, coming!

2169
02:00:50,500 --> 02:00:53,250
[vendor 4] Just 25 Rupees.

2170
02:00:57,083 --> 02:00:58,792
[Shilpa] A boy in a green shirt...

2171
02:01:00,917 --> 02:01:02,792
Oh my Raasu Kutti!

2172
02:01:02,958 --> 02:01:06,792
-If you see him, keep him here.
-I will. Now go search.

2173
02:01:07,708 --> 02:01:09,333
Where will I search for him?

2174
02:01:09,833 --> 02:01:14,083
[vendor] Both the father and mother will
be careful, but "it's" in between.

2175
02:01:14,208 --> 02:01:17,208
[sobbing]

2176
02:01:21,708 --> 02:01:24,375
[man 9] Why is she still here?
Maybe she took your offer?

2177
02:01:24,458 --> 02:01:25,750
She wants your baby.

2178
02:01:25,833 --> 02:01:28,250
Told you these are my lucky sunglasses.

2179
02:01:35,542 --> 02:01:37,458
Raasukutti!

2180
02:01:37,917 --> 02:01:41,083
-Hail, Lord Ram!
-Hail, Lord Ram!

2181
02:01:42,583 --> 02:01:44,542
[Berlin] Come on, little fellow.

2182
02:01:44,833 --> 02:01:46,500
Ekambaram!

2183
02:01:46,833 --> 02:01:48,333
Just drop it in a safe place.

2184
02:01:48,458 --> 02:01:50,417
I don’t want it to get stomped on.

2185
02:01:52,708 --> 02:01:54,292
[Berlin sighs]

2186
02:01:57,208 --> 02:01:58,042
[Berlin] Shilpa!

2187
02:01:58,250 --> 02:01:59,542
Come, come, come.

2188
02:01:59,958 --> 02:02:01,708
-You’re truly an artist.
-Sir, sir...

2189
02:02:01,792 --> 02:02:03,625
-I am unable to get over you...
-Sir, sir...

2190
02:02:03,708 --> 02:02:06,917
-My son is missing, sir! Help me find him!
-Oh darn!

2191
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:08,583
-I thought you came back
-Sir...

2192
02:02:08,708 --> 02:02:10,375
-out of love for the officer.
-Please, sir!

2193
02:02:10,500 --> 02:02:12,500
-But you came for a different reason, huh?
-Sir!

2194
02:02:13,625 --> 02:02:15,458
Sir, it's the same kid

2195
02:02:15,542 --> 02:02:17,208
who came here with me this morning.

2196
02:02:17,333 --> 02:02:18,500
He’s gone missing.

2197
02:02:18,583 --> 02:02:19,917
Help me find him!

2198
02:02:21,667 --> 02:02:23,667
Sir, please sir.

2199
02:02:26,417 --> 02:02:28,958
-Sure, sure. Why not?
-Sir!

2200
02:02:30,167 --> 02:02:32,375
-File a complaint.
-Sir!

2201
02:02:33,167 --> 02:02:35,625
-We’ll find him as soon as possible.
-Sir, there's no time!

2202
02:02:35,750 --> 02:02:38,125
He must be close by.
Send some people, come along.

2203
02:02:38,208 --> 02:02:40,125
Take your fucking hands off me!
How dare you touch me!

2204
02:02:40,500 --> 02:02:41,750
Don’t we have procedures to follow?

2205
02:02:45,875 --> 02:02:47,375
Tsk. Tsk. Tsk.

2206
02:02:48,167 --> 02:02:52,417
I often lose my cool.
This job is so stressful.

2207
02:02:57,958 --> 02:02:58,792
Sir!

2208
02:02:59,208 --> 02:03:02,750
Earlier, I wanted to talk
to you at great length,

2209
02:03:03,167 --> 02:03:05,083
but I quickly became speechless.

2210
02:03:05,292 --> 02:03:06,875
What is this, sir?

2211
02:03:06,958 --> 02:03:08,292
But now,

2212
02:03:08,750 --> 02:03:11,125
I think I'll be fluent.

2213
02:03:11,500 --> 02:03:12,375
Can you just...

2214
02:03:12,708 --> 02:03:15,375
Huh? Once... What'd you say?

2215
02:03:15,500 --> 02:03:18,250
-Hey, what the fuck?
-Fucking raising your voice?

2216
02:03:18,333 --> 02:03:20,292
[sobbing]

2217
02:03:20,625 --> 02:03:23,083
I did so many things for you.
Did we follow any procedure then?

2218
02:03:23,667 --> 02:03:26,083
-Is that blackmail?
-Sir, sir!

2219
02:03:26,167 --> 02:03:27,708
-Are you planning to tell the press
-Sir!

2220
02:03:27,792 --> 02:03:28,750
and the senior officers?

2221
02:03:28,833 --> 02:03:30,667
Sir! I just came to report
my missing child.

2222
02:03:30,750 --> 02:03:32,458
-Why are you thrashing me?
-You lose your child,

2223
02:03:32,542 --> 02:03:34,375
and I have to find him? You whore!

2224
02:03:34,458 --> 02:03:36,125
Fucking whore! Whoring cunt!

2225
02:03:39,458 --> 02:03:40,583
What the...

2226
02:03:42,625 --> 02:03:44,583
You lured me with this?

2227
02:03:47,458 --> 02:03:49,208
It's a forgery. Fraudster!

2228
02:03:49,333 --> 02:03:50,833
Fake boob!

2229
02:03:50,917 --> 02:03:53,000
[both grunt]

2230
02:03:53,083 --> 02:03:55,958
Let go! Let go! Let go!

2231
02:03:56,042 --> 02:03:58,500
[all grunting]

2232
02:04:00,250 --> 02:04:01,708
Let go, bald bitch!

2233
02:04:01,792 --> 02:04:03,583
[all groaning]

2234
02:04:06,333 --> 02:04:07,750
You fucking...

2235
02:04:07,833 --> 02:04:09,333
-You bloody!
-[grunts]

2236
02:04:12,042 --> 02:04:13,667
-Hold her!
-[Shilpa groans]

2237
02:04:18,875 --> 02:04:20,792
[Shilpa grunting]

2238
02:04:24,792 --> 02:04:26,417
Hold it! Pull her back!

2239
02:04:26,500 --> 02:04:28,625
-[police 1] Pull her!
-[police 2] I am not able to hold, man!

2240
02:04:30,500 --> 02:04:32,125
Grab her waist. Don't be coy.

2241
02:04:34,542 --> 02:04:38,542
-[police 1] Hey, don't!
-[police 2] Grab her, man!

2242
02:04:42,792 --> 02:04:44,417
[Shilpa] Die!

2243
02:04:44,500 --> 02:04:45,625
[thuds]

2244
02:04:46,542 --> 02:04:48,250
[Shilpa panting]

2245
02:04:54,125 --> 02:04:55,292
[Shilpa groans]

2246
02:05:06,125 --> 02:05:07,833
[chuckles]

2247
02:05:08,750 --> 02:05:11,750
I thought she was
going to do something fuck-tacular,

2248
02:05:12,333 --> 02:05:14,917
and then she curses me like a hermit.

2249
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:16,708
[chuckles]

2250
02:05:17,708 --> 02:05:20,292
My wife, a chaste woman,

2251
02:05:21,792 --> 02:05:24,708
even her curses don’t affect me.

2252
02:05:25,417 --> 02:05:27,042
This is nothing.

2253
02:05:30,083 --> 02:05:31,583
Will you guys have tea?

2254
02:05:32,958 --> 02:05:34,542
Get some tea please.

2255
02:05:36,875 --> 02:05:37,792
Sir...

2256
02:05:37,875 --> 02:05:39,458
Coconut biscuit...

2257
02:05:41,292 --> 02:05:42,917
Those coconut biscuits.

2258
02:05:50,167 --> 02:05:53,708
[Berlin] And you thought cops
were just politicians' bitches?

2259
02:05:53,792 --> 02:05:55,375
That we're kissing ass all day?

2260
02:05:55,458 --> 02:05:56,958
I'll fucking skin you alive! Sir...

2261
02:05:57,417 --> 02:05:58,292
Sir.

2262
02:05:59,375 --> 02:06:00,833
Let me tell you...

2263
02:06:02,375 --> 02:06:03,542
Okay.

2264
02:06:09,292 --> 02:06:11,625
He and I went to the same college.

2265
02:06:13,417 --> 02:06:14,958
We were in love.

2266
02:06:16,125 --> 02:06:18,583
After my marriage,
I met him for the first time today.

2267
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:22,958
I don't know how it started.

2268
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:25,750
We did it,

2269
02:06:26,125 --> 02:06:27,792
and he died during the act.

2270
02:06:29,500 --> 02:06:31,750
You gave him a happy ending.
[laughing]

2271
02:06:32,750 --> 02:06:35,500
Like they say in the movies.

2272
02:06:36,833 --> 02:06:38,917
So, you really got fucked.

2273
02:06:40,333 --> 02:06:42,958
Like there was no tomorrow!

2274
02:06:43,833 --> 02:06:46,542
Mayilvaganam, think of the devil!

2275
02:06:47,042 --> 02:06:49,875
That video you posted
on our Little Boys group...

2276
02:06:49,958 --> 02:06:51,375
So sleazy! So cool!

2277
02:06:51,458 --> 02:06:54,708
-[Mugil] You could have lied.
-[Vaembu] But that's what happened!

2278
02:06:54,875 --> 02:06:56,458
Oh, Vaembu the virtuous!

2279
02:06:56,625 --> 02:06:58,250
Hey, shush!

2280
02:06:58,667 --> 02:07:00,542
Just hold on, sir.

2281
02:07:01,042 --> 02:07:03,917
Since you guys are so open,

2282
02:07:04,167 --> 02:07:06,333
I'll open up, too.

2283
02:07:06,708 --> 02:07:09,875
[Berling] Sir, there's a case
under your jurisdiction.

2284
02:07:10,375 --> 02:07:12,667
I'll have to see
if it leads to your promotion.

2285
02:07:12,750 --> 02:07:14,375
Or my jackpot!

2286
02:07:15,042 --> 02:07:17,208
I'll call you back, okay?

2287
02:07:17,625 --> 02:07:18,958
Dickwad!
[beeps]

2288
02:07:21,542 --> 02:07:23,167
I just got promoted.

2289
02:07:24,125 --> 02:07:26,042
No way I'm getting another one.

2290
02:07:26,250 --> 02:07:28,458
Cheap bastards. Huh.

2291
02:07:29,792 --> 02:07:31,250
I can turn you both in,

2292
02:07:31,708 --> 02:07:33,917
get a cheap bronze medal for it,

2293
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:35,500
and pin it on my shirt,

2294
02:07:35,583 --> 02:07:37,958
But I personally think
that lacks character.

2295
02:07:38,917 --> 02:07:45,417
[Berlin] Let's say I don't turn you in,
or the video I shot of you.

2296
02:07:46,042 --> 02:07:51,167
How do you plan
to reciprocate my kindness?

2297
02:07:54,708 --> 02:07:56,833
Sir, I have 500 thousand Rupees
in the bank.

2298
02:07:57,042 --> 02:07:58,167
Seriously?

2299
02:07:58,292 --> 02:08:00,583
Is this a pickpocket case?

2300
02:08:00,667 --> 02:08:02,417
Sir! No, sir.

2301
02:08:02,833 --> 02:08:04,833
If we sell our jewelry,

2302
02:08:05,208 --> 02:08:06,917
we can scrape
together another 300 thousand.

2303
02:08:07,083 --> 02:08:09,333
800 thousand in all?

2304
02:08:09,458 --> 02:08:10,625
Dude!

2305
02:08:10,833 --> 02:08:12,458
Fuck money!

2306
02:08:12,708 --> 02:08:14,292
It's just printed paper.

2307
02:08:14,417 --> 02:08:15,875
It comes, it goes,

2308
02:08:15,958 --> 02:08:17,583
gets eaten by bugs.

2309
02:08:17,667 --> 02:08:20,250
My brother, there's more
to life than money.

2310
02:08:20,375 --> 02:08:21,958
Can you think with your heart?

2311
02:08:22,083 --> 02:08:23,667
There must be another way...

2312
02:08:24,667 --> 02:08:27,917
to make this respected
government officer happy.

2313
02:08:28,708 --> 02:08:32,083
Huh?

2314
02:08:32,167 --> 02:08:33,667
No! I won't do that!

2315
02:08:33,750 --> 02:08:35,292
Not a chance!

2316
02:08:37,333 --> 02:08:38,292
Dude!

2317
02:08:38,583 --> 02:08:40,625
She cracked it!

2318
02:08:41,167 --> 02:08:42,792
What a genius!

2319
02:08:43,042 --> 02:08:44,417
It's her I want.

2320
02:08:44,500 --> 02:08:46,625
[sobbing]

2321
02:08:46,708 --> 02:08:47,542
Why?

2322
02:08:47,667 --> 02:08:48,542
Why are you crying?

2323
02:08:48,625 --> 02:08:50,917
What's wrong now?

2324
02:08:51,958 --> 02:08:53,292
You married this man,

2325
02:08:53,542 --> 02:08:55,667
rocked the bed with him.

2326
02:08:55,792 --> 02:08:58,500
What's wrong with adding
one more to the list?

2327
02:08:59,167 --> 02:09:02,167
Does officer Berlin repulse you so much?

2328
02:09:04,833 --> 02:09:07,833
Bro, talk some sense into her.

2329
02:09:12,125 --> 02:09:13,542
Please!

2330
02:09:13,625 --> 02:09:15,250
I can't do this!

2331
02:09:15,583 --> 02:09:17,208
I just can't!

2332
02:09:18,625 --> 02:09:20,625
It's not like someone saw us,

2333
02:09:20,750 --> 02:09:23,625
and is threatening to go to the police.

2334
02:09:24,500 --> 02:09:26,000
Here the case is different!

2335
02:09:26,375 --> 02:09:28,000
He is the police!

2336
02:09:28,583 --> 02:09:30,833
[sobbing]

2337
02:09:33,042 --> 02:09:34,167
See...

2338
02:09:34,667 --> 02:09:36,375
Kannamma and I were in love.

2339
02:09:37,375 --> 02:09:39,667
He was very upset, and I felt so guilty.

2340
02:09:40,417 --> 02:09:42,667
He's not a child
that I can comfort with candy.

2341
02:09:44,042 --> 02:09:45,458
So I called him home,

2342
02:09:45,583 --> 02:09:46,583
he came,

2343
02:09:47,875 --> 02:09:49,208
and all this happened.

2344
02:09:51,958 --> 02:09:55,958
It doesn't mean I'm a slut
who'll fuck anyone.

2345
02:09:56,917 --> 02:09:59,958
I understand, but...

2346
02:10:01,667 --> 02:10:03,625
[sobbing]

2347
02:10:14,792 --> 02:10:17,042
You wanted to get a divorce for this

2348
02:10:17,917 --> 02:10:21,000
and now you want me
to do the exact same thing!

2349
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:28,708
You want me to be virtuous
yet when you want to, I should be a whore?

2350
02:10:35,833 --> 02:10:37,375
Sir, give us a minute.

2351
02:10:37,458 --> 02:10:39,458
-We're still talking.
-[yawns]

2352
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:43,042
Dude, why're you so quiet?

2353
02:10:44,417 --> 02:10:46,417
You killed someone.

2354
02:10:46,875 --> 02:10:48,958
You helped cover it up.

2355
02:10:49,667 --> 02:10:53,333
I'm just a fly on the wall.
My presence won't rock the boat.

2356
02:10:53,917 --> 02:10:56,458
Feel free to express yourselves.

2357
02:10:57,125 --> 02:10:59,333
I won't judge you.

2358
02:11:01,250 --> 02:11:02,667
[Mugil] Vaembu, think about it.

2359
02:11:02,792 --> 02:11:04,542
At least he's giving us a way out.

2360
02:11:04,833 --> 02:11:09,125
With anyone else, it would be FUBAR.

2361
02:11:09,458 --> 02:11:10,542
Dude!

2362
02:11:10,625 --> 02:11:12,083
You nailed it.

2363
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:16,875
When we go on long drives,

2364
02:11:17,917 --> 02:11:20,417
don't we use public toilets
for emergencies?

2365
02:11:21,458 --> 02:11:23,208
Can you think of it like that?

2366
02:11:23,333 --> 02:11:24,208
Dude!

2367
02:11:24,792 --> 02:11:27,000
Sir, that's why I asked for privacy.

2368
02:11:29,167 --> 02:11:31,000
[Mugil] If it was money,

2369
02:11:31,500 --> 02:11:33,542
or he wanted something from me,

2370
02:11:33,708 --> 02:11:35,500
then I would definitely do it.

2371
02:11:37,500 --> 02:11:40,542
You don't know me well enough.

2372
02:11:41,042 --> 02:11:44,375
Don't tempt fate.

2373
02:11:50,208 --> 02:11:52,250
I told you I'd surrender!

2374
02:11:52,875 --> 02:11:54,292
Let me go to prison!

2375
02:11:54,375 --> 02:11:57,958
[In altered voice]
Who told you you're safe in prison?

2376
02:11:58,625 --> 02:12:01,708
There are jailers, wardens, cellmates,

2377
02:12:02,250 --> 02:12:03,875
too many people to please.

2378
02:12:04,042 --> 02:12:06,917
Some stories are so awful
that I lose sleep at night!

2379
02:12:07,083 --> 02:12:09,708
Compared to that,

2380
02:12:09,792 --> 02:12:11,708
I'm a harmless bunny.

2381
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,167
-A box of chocolates.
-[Vaembu sobbing]

2382
02:12:15,583 --> 02:12:17,500
I'll treat you like a queen.

2383
02:12:18,292 --> 02:12:19,750
Decide for yourself.

2384
02:12:20,042 --> 02:12:21,250
A bunch of Jokers?

2385
02:12:21,625 --> 02:12:23,250
Or is this rising Dark Knight?

2386
02:12:23,583 --> 02:12:25,000
Those ugly inmates,

2387
02:12:25,375 --> 02:12:27,208
or this box of chocolates?
[laughs]

2388
02:12:29,042 --> 02:12:30,958
[sobbing]

2389
02:12:32,375 --> 02:12:33,625
[Mugil] Vaembu.

2390
02:12:35,583 --> 02:12:36,917
Vaembu.

2391
02:12:39,042 --> 02:12:42,208
Don't assume it's a simple murder case,

2392
02:12:42,333 --> 02:12:46,625
and that you'll be out in seven years.

2393
02:12:47,292 --> 02:12:49,792
There are people
who spent 20 years in jail,

2394
02:12:49,958 --> 02:12:52,042
just for traveling without a ticket!

2395
02:12:52,500 --> 02:12:54,708
That's our system for you.

2396
02:12:55,125 --> 02:12:57,208
I could leak the story to the press,

2397
02:12:57,292 --> 02:12:59,167
ruin your name,

2398
02:12:59,583 --> 02:13:02,083
drag your names
into talk shows and make sure

2399
02:13:02,208 --> 02:13:05,583
at least one person
from each of your families

2400
02:13:05,750 --> 02:13:07,250
hang themselves.

2401
02:13:07,750 --> 02:13:13,000
When needed, Berlin can hit
way below the belt with no qualms.

2402
02:13:15,875 --> 02:13:18,792
Vaembu, Vaembu.

2403
02:13:22,250 --> 02:13:23,917
[crying]

2404
02:13:26,250 --> 02:13:27,500
Vaembu! Vaembu.

2405
02:13:30,958 --> 02:13:33,083
What did you say?

2406
02:13:34,958 --> 02:13:37,083
Whoa! My little munchkin.

2407
02:13:37,292 --> 02:13:39,292
[snapping]

2408
02:13:39,958 --> 02:13:42,708
Buttercup! First, we go to Mirzapet,

2409
02:13:43,042 --> 02:13:46,042
then we burn the body there
at a friend's kiln.

2410
02:13:46,250 --> 02:13:49,917
Then we'll rent a cozy apartment
and make it our pleasure pad.

2411
02:13:50,125 --> 02:13:51,458
Bro,

2412
02:13:51,625 --> 02:13:53,250
you sign a blank paper

2413
02:13:53,333 --> 02:13:55,542
and vanish from our lives forever.

2414
02:13:56,042 --> 02:13:59,042
[Berlin] Come, come! Good times ahead!

2415
02:13:59,667 --> 02:14:00,833
Come on! Come on!

2416
02:14:00,958 --> 02:14:02,167
Quick!

2417
02:14:02,292 --> 02:14:05,792
I've been such a big help,
yet not a single "thank you."

2418
02:14:06,250 --> 02:14:08,375
[Berlin] The world is so ungrateful,
dear Berlin.

2419
02:14:09,167 --> 02:14:12,792
-Such a struggle to get small things done.
-[Vaembu wails]

2420
02:14:13,500 --> 02:14:15,292
Come on! Start the car!

2421
02:14:15,417 --> 02:14:17,042
Follow me just like that!

2422
02:14:19,333 --> 02:14:21,708
You accepted me
when I was drowning in the sea.

2423
02:14:21,958 --> 02:14:23,833
Now accept my son,
who is drowning in his own blood.

2424
02:14:23,958 --> 02:14:27,250
The water God flows away
from the mountain of arrogance,

2425
02:14:27,458 --> 02:14:29,667
into the depths of humility.

2426
02:14:29,958 --> 02:14:33,583
God flows the water over pits
and mounds and levels them all.

2427
02:14:33,750 --> 02:14:35,625
[Arputham in thought]
<i>It's just a rock, Pastor.</i>

2428
02:14:36,625 --> 02:14:41,083
-Forgive me, God! Forgive me, God!
-<i>It's just a rock, Pastor.</i>

2429
02:14:42,667 --> 02:14:44,000
Doubt is the weapon of evil!

2430
02:14:44,125 --> 02:14:45,500
Doubt is the chariot of the devil!

2431
02:14:45,583 --> 02:14:48,875
Doubt is the favorite child of Satan!

2432
02:14:49,042 --> 02:14:52,792
Oh Lord! Forgive me!

2433
02:14:52,917 --> 02:14:57,542
Lord! Oh Lord!

2434
02:14:57,792 --> 02:14:59,750
-[Ramasamy] Arputham! Arputham!
-Ramasamy!

2435
02:15:00,250 --> 02:15:02,167
Ramasamy! Did you get the money?

2436
02:15:02,250 --> 02:15:04,542
Wherever I went,
they chased me off, saying

2437
02:15:04,667 --> 02:15:07,542
"you didn't let us go to the hospital
when we were sick,

2438
02:15:07,708 --> 02:15:11,000
but now when your son is hurt
you rush to the hospital."

2439
02:15:11,083 --> 02:15:13,208
They even tried to beat me up, Arputham.

2440
02:15:19,750 --> 02:15:21,500
Did you sell your bike, Ramasamy?

2441
02:15:21,667 --> 02:15:23,917
That's okay, Arputham! Keep praying!

2442
02:15:24,333 --> 02:15:26,042
Pray for your son.

2443
02:15:36,792 --> 02:15:38,167
Lord! Oh Lord!

2444
02:15:38,875 --> 02:15:44,875
[indistinct prayer]

2445
02:15:44,958 --> 02:15:51,042
[indistinct prayer]

2446
02:15:51,125 --> 02:15:55,542
Lord! Oh Lord!

2447
02:15:55,875 --> 02:15:58,042
<i>I'm just a rock, Pastor!</i>

2448
02:15:58,167 --> 02:16:02,167
[indistinct prayer]

2449
02:16:02,292 --> 02:16:04,417
[sobbing]

2450
02:16:04,500 --> 02:16:06,958
Lord, save my son!

2451
02:16:07,458 --> 02:16:09,708
<i>I'm just a rock, Pastor!</i>

2452
02:16:11,333 --> 02:16:13,125
You are truth! You are heaven!

2453
02:16:13,208 --> 02:16:15,125
You are mercy! You are soul!

2454
02:16:15,208 --> 02:16:16,500
<i>I'm just a rock, Pastor!</i>

2455
02:16:17,083 --> 02:16:18,375
Doubt is the weapon of evil!

2456
02:16:18,458 --> 02:16:19,833
Doubt is the chariot of the devil!

2457
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,875
-Forgive me, Lord!
-Doubt is the favorite child of Satan!

2458
02:16:22,958 --> 02:16:24,417
-Forgive me, Lord!
-Doubt is the...

2459
02:16:24,500 --> 02:16:26,250
-You are truth! You are heaven!
-weapon of evil!

2460
02:16:26,333 --> 02:16:28,375
-You are mercy and soul!
-It is the chariot of the devil!

2461
02:16:28,458 --> 02:16:30,625
-You are life and death!
-It is the favorite child of Satan!

2462
02:16:30,708 --> 02:16:32,458
-You are the end!
-Doubt is evil's weapon!

2463
02:16:32,542 --> 02:16:34,333
<i>I'm just a rock, Pastor!</i>

2464
02:16:34,458 --> 02:16:38,125
-I’ll hold your hand, and you hold mine!
-Lord will not abandon you!

2465
02:16:38,208 --> 02:16:40,458
One who doubts Lord will be vanquished!

2466
02:16:40,542 --> 02:16:42,750
Lord saves the one who trusts!

2467
02:16:42,833 --> 02:16:44,917
Lord drowns the one who doubts!

2468
02:16:46,750 --> 02:16:47,958
Arputham!

2469
02:16:48,083 --> 02:16:50,125
It's time for the surgery.

2470
02:16:50,667 --> 02:16:51,750
-Arputham!
-[sobbing loudly]

2471
02:16:52,458 --> 02:16:53,708
[Ramasamy] It's getting late.

2472
02:16:54,792 --> 02:16:56,958
You are the past, you are the present,
you are the future.

2473
02:16:57,042 --> 02:16:59,958
When you are beyond the clutches of time,
how can death enter your shrine?

2474
02:17:00,083 --> 02:17:03,583
Only you have the strength to bring back
a soul from the other side.

2475
02:17:03,667 --> 02:17:05,375
You saved me when
millions died in the tsunami.

2476
02:17:07,458 --> 02:17:09,167
Doubt is the weapon of evil!

2477
02:17:09,250 --> 02:17:11,250
Doubt is the chariot of the devil!

2478
02:17:11,417 --> 02:17:13,583
Doubt is the favorite child of Satan!

2479
02:17:13,667 --> 02:17:15,750
Doubt is the weapon of evil!

2480
02:17:15,875 --> 02:17:17,833
Doubt is the chariot of the devil!

2481
02:17:17,958 --> 02:17:18,917
Doubt is...

2482
02:17:20,625 --> 02:17:22,292
[phone rings]

2483
02:17:24,708 --> 02:17:27,042
Meenal is calling
from the hospital, Arputham.

2484
02:17:34,917 --> 02:17:37,042
I'm scared, Ramasamy.

2485
02:17:41,542 --> 02:17:43,417
They are still in need of money.

2486
02:17:44,083 --> 02:17:47,167
But this means God is still holding
on to your son’s life!

2487
02:17:47,250 --> 02:17:49,667
Why should he hold it?
Why can’t he give it back to us?

2488
02:17:49,792 --> 02:17:51,042
Why should he suffer?

2489
02:17:51,292 --> 02:17:54,167
Because it is only in times of
suffering that we think of God.

2490
02:17:54,292 --> 02:17:56,333
If God wants us to suffer
so that we'll think of him,

2491
02:17:56,583 --> 02:17:58,375
doesn't it make him petty and dumb?

2492
02:17:58,500 --> 02:18:00,250
How can you say that?

2493
02:18:00,583 --> 02:18:02,458
Aren't you the right hand of God?

2494
02:18:02,583 --> 02:18:05,792
When millions died in the tsunami,
God saved only you.

2495
02:18:05,917 --> 02:18:08,250
How can you doubt his accuracy and intent?

2496
02:18:08,500 --> 02:18:11,042
Ramasamy,
you know what happened yesterday?

2497
02:18:17,375 --> 02:18:20,333
[low humming]

2498
02:18:31,167 --> 02:18:33,458
[Shilpa] Pastor! Pastor!

2499
02:18:33,667 --> 02:18:35,458
Pastor! My son is missing.

2500
02:18:35,875 --> 02:18:37,250
What do I do?

2501
02:18:37,333 --> 02:18:39,792
My sins are looming over my son's life.

2502
02:18:40,042 --> 02:18:40,917
Pastor!

2503
02:18:41,083 --> 02:18:42,750
Deliver me of my sins. Show mercy.

2504
02:18:42,833 --> 02:18:44,333
Grant me forgiveness.

2505
02:18:44,417 --> 02:18:45,958
But I'm not a priest.

2506
02:18:46,625 --> 02:18:47,917
I’m not even a Christian.

2507
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,917
Neither am I, but I have sinned.

2508
02:18:51,250 --> 02:18:52,958
Deliver me from my sins.

2509
02:18:53,125 --> 02:18:55,875
Save me. My son is missing.

2510
02:18:56,500 --> 02:18:58,375
I was plagued,

2511
02:18:58,500 --> 02:19:01,042
plagued with sins of my deed.

2512
02:19:01,125 --> 02:19:06,958
The moment I touched my son,
they leeched onto him.

2513
02:19:07,458 --> 02:19:11,000
After committing that sin,
I couldn't eat, couldn't sleep,

2514
02:19:11,083 --> 02:19:13,833
and I just wept for weeks.

2515
02:19:14,750 --> 02:19:16,833
Suddenly, thoughts of my son
overwhelmed me.

2516
02:19:17,708 --> 02:19:18,958
I called

2517
02:19:19,083 --> 02:19:20,833
suddenly, came to see him.

2518
02:19:20,958 --> 02:19:22,458
There he was.

2519
02:19:22,625 --> 02:19:26,958
Such a beautiful,
intelligent, wonderful boy.

2520
02:19:30,292 --> 02:19:32,708
All parents believe their children
are wonderful and intelligent,

2521
02:19:32,792 --> 02:19:36,583
but my son is all those things, for real.

2522
02:19:37,750 --> 02:19:40,417
The very day I met him,
I went and lost him.

2523
02:19:40,500 --> 02:19:41,833
I am such a terrible sinner!

2524
02:19:41,917 --> 02:19:43,958
Cry not! Where can a little kid go?

2525
02:19:44,083 --> 02:19:46,208
I'm sure he's already home.
Go home and check.

2526
02:19:46,958 --> 02:19:52,583
I'm sure they'll sever his limbs,
and force him to beg on the streets.

2527
02:19:53,167 --> 02:19:56,958
Those are just stories told
to scare little children.

2528
02:19:57,750 --> 02:19:59,917
No, pastor!

2529
02:20:00,208 --> 02:20:01,542
[Shilpa sobbing]

2530
02:20:05,625 --> 02:20:07,708
When I was in Bombay...

2531
02:20:07,792 --> 02:20:13,875
I was asked to escort two children
from Kalyan to the city.

2532
02:20:14,792 --> 02:20:21,250
I did it out of sheer desperation
for a measly sum.

2533
02:20:25,500 --> 02:20:31,375
A month later, I saw them begging
at the traffic signal,

2534
02:20:31,458 --> 02:20:35,458
one without an eye
the other without a limb.

2535
02:20:36,167 --> 02:20:39,958
They were perfectly normal
when I dropped them off.

2536
02:20:40,083 --> 02:20:43,958
Not in my wildest dreams...

2537
02:20:45,167 --> 02:20:50,583
I've sinned gravely.
Won't I ever get cleansed?

2538
02:20:50,708 --> 02:20:53,875
Forgive my sins, Pastor!

2539
02:20:54,625 --> 02:21:00,542
Forgive me and save my son,
Pastor! Save him!

2540
02:21:00,708 --> 02:21:02,750
[Shilpa] I have sinned!

2541
02:21:03,583 --> 02:21:05,958
[Arputham] There cannot be a greater sin.

2542
02:21:06,667 --> 02:21:08,542
Even my God cannot absolve you.

2543
02:21:09,125 --> 02:21:10,750
How can you live with yourself?

2544
02:21:10,917 --> 02:21:13,417
-Your death might cleanse this world.
-[Shilpa] What am I to do, Pastor?

2545
02:21:14,250 --> 02:21:15,958
I did want to die, Father.

2546
02:21:16,042 --> 02:21:17,792
When I walked into the sea,
it pulled back.

2547
02:21:17,875 --> 02:21:20,042
When millions died in that tsunami,
I was spared.

2548
02:21:20,292 --> 02:21:24,083
Why was I saved, so that those children
could get mutilated one day?

2549
02:21:24,167 --> 02:21:26,417
Or so I could lose my son like this?

2550
02:21:26,667 --> 02:21:28,417
[Arputham] You survived the tsunami?

2551
02:21:28,792 --> 02:21:31,208
Yes, Pastor!

2552
02:21:31,500 --> 02:21:32,333
[cop] Hey!

2553
02:21:32,583 --> 02:21:35,625
The other cops told me
that your child is missing.

2554
02:21:36,833 --> 02:21:38,417
Come, let's go find him.

2555
02:21:39,292 --> 02:21:40,917
[Arputham] How did you survive
the tsunami?

2556
02:21:41,042 --> 02:21:43,750
[Shilpa] I held on to a rock.

2557
02:21:45,375 --> 02:21:47,417
[Arputham] What was in the rock?

2558
02:21:47,542 --> 02:21:49,833
[Shilpa] It's just a rock, Pastor!

2559
02:21:50,417 --> 02:21:52,042
[Arputham] Where is it now?

2560
02:21:53,167 --> 02:21:54,917
[Shilpa] Why does it matter?
It was just a rock.

2561
02:21:55,042 --> 02:21:56,875
It must still be lying there.

2562
02:21:58,708 --> 02:22:00,458
[Arputham] Wasn't there God in that rock?

2563
02:22:02,500 --> 02:22:04,833
-[Arputham] It's only a rock, Ramasamy!
-Arputham, no!

2564
02:22:04,917 --> 02:22:09,250
So you have lost faith because you
were not the only "chosen one" God saved?

2565
02:22:09,333 --> 02:22:10,833
[Arputham] This is no God.
There is no God.

2566
02:22:10,917 --> 02:22:12,125
Arputham!

2567
02:22:12,208 --> 02:22:13,917
Search for God through your heart,
not your head.

2568
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000

02:23:11,042 --> 02:23:12,542
Quiet, rascal!

2578
02:23:20,542 --> 02:23:21,458
[all gasp]

2579
02:23:41,750 --> 02:23:44,583
[Thooyavan] <i>Sorry, madam. I'll never steal
at the northie’s house again.</i>

2580
02:23:44,667 --> 02:23:46,000
<i>I really like them.</i>

2581
02:23:46,083 --> 02:23:48,333
<i>I only speak Tamil
because I hang out with these guys.</i>

2582
02:23:48,417 --> 02:23:50,542
-<i>In fact, I ate roti for breakfast.</i>
-[Gaaji] <i>Hey!</i>

2583
02:23:50,625 --> 02:23:52,250
<i>You're talking, but your lips
aren't moving.</i>

2584
02:23:52,333 --> 02:23:54,542
[Vasanth] <i>Neither are yours!
Nor mine! Oh my God!</i>

2585
02:23:54,792 --> 02:23:55,917
[Thooyavan] <i>Then how?</i>

2586
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:57,208
<i>Swear words! It's because of her.</i>

2587
02:23:57,292 --> 02:23:59,917
[woman 9] <i>We are using neither words,
nor sound.</i>

2588
02:24:00,167 --> 02:24:02,458
-<i>We're communicating with our thoughts.</i>
-[Vasanth] How, madam?

2589
02:24:02,583 --> 02:24:06,250
[woman 9] <i>You've changed senses into six,
but there are far more in reality.</i>

2590
02:24:06,333 --> 02:24:07,833
[Gaaji] <i>Who are you, northie madam?</i>

2591
02:24:11,958 --> 02:24:13,083
[Vasanth] <i>Kamasutra.</i>

2592
02:24:13,167 --> 02:24:14,333
[Thooyavan] <i>Beauti...</i>

2593
02:24:14,458 --> 02:24:15,333
[all gasp]

2594
02:24:30,667 --> 02:24:33,250
[Thooyavan] <i>I can’t move! I’m frozen!</i>

2595
02:24:33,583 --> 02:24:35,667
<i>Can't move my feet!</i>

2596
02:24:41,792 --> 02:24:43,417
<i>I-la can’t-la move-la my-la legs-la.</i>

2597
02:24:43,500 --> 02:24:44,750
<i>I'm already clueless.</i>

2598
02:24:44,833 --> 02:24:47,083
[Thooyavan] <i>Why are you thinking
in gibberish? Pumpkin head!</i>

2599
02:24:47,208 --> 02:24:51,500
<i>Madam, can we please skip ESP for now
and start using words?</i>

2600
02:24:51,958 --> 02:24:52,792
Daddy!

2601
02:24:52,875 --> 02:24:53,833
Mommy!

2602
02:24:53,958 --> 02:24:55,292
Vasanth's sister!

2603
02:24:55,792 --> 02:24:58,583
I don't know if it is gentlemanly
to say this in front of a lady.

2604
02:24:58,667 --> 02:25:00,833
I'm so scared, I'm about to pee my pants.

2605
02:25:01,042 --> 02:25:03,542
Besides, I don’t know
if you even are a lady.

2606
02:25:03,625 --> 02:25:04,875
What are you so scared of?

2607
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:06,250
It's so beautiful.

2608
02:25:06,333 --> 02:25:08,542
Is there no limit to your horniness?

2609
02:25:08,708 --> 02:25:10,708
You're horniest of the horniest!

2610
02:25:10,792 --> 02:25:13,083
[woman 9] Aren't you really scared of me?

2611
02:25:13,250 --> 02:25:14,167
No.

2612
02:25:29,542 --> 02:25:31,875
I wanted to see how I look in your eyes.

2613
02:25:31,958 --> 02:25:33,667
Your eyes perceive beautifully.

2614
02:25:33,958 --> 02:25:35,542
You are a good soul!

2615
02:25:36,458 --> 02:25:37,375
Yes!

2616
02:25:37,542 --> 02:25:38,667
Are you an alien?

2617
02:25:38,750 --> 02:25:43,875
I really can’t say. I was born here,
but my roots are in outer space.

2618
02:25:43,958 --> 02:25:45,750
[Vasanth] No way! Not a chance!

2619
02:25:45,958 --> 02:25:49,083
Why? You think aliens only visit America?

2620
02:25:49,708 --> 02:25:51,708
Can you do me a favor?

2621
02:25:51,792 --> 02:25:53,917
Of course! What? How?

2622
02:25:54,292 --> 02:25:56,042
That’s my friend Kishore.

2623
02:25:56,208 --> 02:25:58,458
He came to me when he
was younger than you.

2624
02:25:59,083 --> 02:26:00,292
He was a great friend.

2625
02:26:00,417 --> 02:26:01,750
He's dead now.

2626
02:26:02,333 --> 02:26:04,500
-No, we just saw him turn over in sleep.
-[Thooyavan] Yes!

2627
02:26:04,583 --> 02:26:06,625
He died after that. Just now.

2628
02:26:06,708 --> 02:26:08,583
About two minutes ago.

2629
02:26:09,792 --> 02:26:11,208
Aren't you upset?

2630
02:26:11,292 --> 02:26:13,667
Death is not something to get upset over.

2631
02:26:13,917 --> 02:26:16,083
It's just a part of life.

2632
02:26:16,167 --> 02:26:17,000
[exhales sharply]

2633
02:26:17,167 --> 02:26:18,250
I see.

2634
02:26:20,917 --> 02:26:23,042
I need to find myself a companion.

2635
02:26:23,167 --> 02:26:25,917
If you're cool with it,
I'd like that to be you.

2636
02:26:26,333 --> 02:26:27,958
I like you very much.

2637
02:26:29,167 --> 02:26:31,542
-Okay!
-Come closer.

2638
02:26:33,708 --> 02:26:36,292
[Thooyavan and Vasanth]
Gaaji! No, no. Wait!

2639
02:26:36,375 --> 02:26:37,875
[Thooyavan and Vasanth] Dude, no!

2640
02:26:37,958 --> 02:26:39,792
-[Thooyavan and Vasanth] Listen, Gaaji!
-[Gaaji] Hey!

2641
02:26:40,708 --> 02:26:41,958
I have a mother,

2642
02:26:42,250 --> 02:26:43,500
and duties to complete.

2643
02:26:43,708 --> 02:26:46,333
What if I leave you later,
like I'm leaving them now?

2644
02:26:46,542 --> 02:26:48,042
Moreover, I am in love with his sister.

2645
02:26:48,167 --> 02:26:49,708
-That's true love.
-[Vasanth] Man!

2646
02:26:49,958 --> 02:26:52,875
Dude! Don't drag my sister
into an inter-species dialogue.

2647
02:26:55,500 --> 02:26:56,833
Trust me.

2648
02:27:05,417 --> 02:27:08,125
Wake up! Wake up! Quickly, Vasanth!

2649
02:27:08,208 --> 02:27:09,667
This is just a dream. Wake up now.

2650
02:27:19,500 --> 02:27:21,500
[spooky music]

2651
02:27:24,042 --> 02:27:26,875
[yelling]

2652
02:27:37,500 --> 02:27:39,917
[Gaaji yelling]

2653
02:27:41,250 --> 02:27:42,833
[both panting]

2654
02:27:49,500 --> 02:27:51,125
How did you do that, madam?

2655
02:27:53,500 --> 02:27:57,125
[woman 9] The same way the first cell
split to become two cells.

2656
02:27:57,250 --> 02:27:58,542
Got it?

2657
02:27:59,708 --> 02:28:01,875
[both panting]

2658
02:28:04,917 --> 02:28:06,917
Of the two Gaajis, which one is ours?

2659
02:28:10,125 --> 02:28:11,333
Both of them.

2660
02:28:11,750 --> 02:28:13,250
[Thooyavan] So which one stays with you?

2661
02:28:17,083 --> 02:28:18,250
[clinks]

2662
02:28:22,792 --> 02:28:24,583
[woman 9] Keep this money for now.

2663
02:28:25,292 --> 02:28:28,042
If you need more,
come tomorrow, or whenever.

2664
02:28:28,458 --> 02:28:29,500
Thanks, madam!

2665
02:28:35,500 --> 02:28:36,375
Dude!

2666
02:28:37,208 --> 02:28:39,208
[Gaaji's clone] If you need any help,
you know who to ask.

2667
02:28:41,458 --> 02:28:42,875
Lucky fellow, you are.

2668
02:28:43,625 --> 02:28:45,917
I don’t know why, but I liked you
the moment I saw you.

2669
02:28:47,292 --> 02:28:48,292
Yes!

2670
02:28:49,958 --> 02:28:51,375
May you be with the force.

2671
02:28:55,292 --> 02:28:57,083
So, what brings you to earth?

2672
02:28:57,333 --> 02:28:58,667
I'll tell you.

2673
02:29:07,125 --> 02:29:10,167
Mugil, I just can't do this.

2674
02:29:13,375 --> 02:29:15,208
I may have nodded then.

2675
02:29:16,708 --> 02:29:18,792
But Mugil, I just can't!

2676
02:29:18,875 --> 02:29:21,083
Somehow get me out of this, please.

2677
02:29:21,833 --> 02:29:23,500
[sobbing]

2678
02:29:27,375 --> 02:29:30,042
I may not have been a good wife to you,

2679
02:29:32,292 --> 02:29:34,375
but do not sacrifice me out of spite.

2680
02:29:36,208 --> 02:29:37,042
Please!

2681
02:29:37,958 --> 02:29:39,583
This shouldn't happen to you, Vaembu,

2682
02:29:41,542 --> 02:29:43,000
whether or not we stay together.

2683
02:29:47,042 --> 02:29:48,500
[panting]

2684
02:29:52,167 --> 02:29:54,625
When he helps us dispose the body,

2685
02:29:55,208 --> 02:29:56,708
you take a video.

2686
02:29:57,750 --> 02:30:01,542
If he comes to you, we can say no,

2687
02:30:02,833 --> 02:30:04,750
because we'll have proof.

2688
02:30:05,500 --> 02:30:08,875
We'll tell him
"leave us alone and we won't turn you in."

2689
02:30:11,125 --> 02:30:12,542
Mugil...

2690
02:30:13,167 --> 02:30:14,458
will it work?

2691
02:30:15,042 --> 02:30:16,000
Sure.

2692
02:30:16,583 --> 02:30:19,417
Just video him disposing of the body.

2693
02:30:23,750 --> 02:30:24,833
[Berlin] Hey!

2694
02:30:25,333 --> 02:30:27,000
The bike just won't start.

2695
02:30:30,375 --> 02:30:34,792
The little bird inside me
has been cooing nonstop.

2696
02:30:36,208 --> 02:30:37,750
Something isn't falling into place.

2697
02:30:38,542 --> 02:30:42,958
We planned to dispose of the body first,
and then get to the act, right?

2698
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,917
I guess we should finish the act now,
and dispose of the body later, okay?

2699
02:30:48,125 --> 02:30:50,042
It's the same thing.

2700
02:30:51,167 --> 02:30:53,292
Dude, turn off the engine.

2701
02:30:53,542 --> 02:30:54,750
Noisy fuck!

2702
02:30:55,417 --> 02:30:56,667
Sweetheart!

2703
02:30:57,083 --> 02:30:58,417
Get out of the car.

2704
02:30:59,708 --> 02:31:01,625
Come, baby potato!

2705
02:31:03,917 --> 02:31:05,875
Come, my little Persian kitten!

2706
02:31:06,500 --> 02:31:08,042
-Don't be shy.
-[Vaembu sobbing]

2707
02:31:08,125 --> 02:31:09,833
We'll make sure he doesn't look.

2708
02:31:09,917 --> 02:31:11,375
Come, come, come.

2709
02:31:13,042 --> 02:31:15,167
Come, baby doll.

2710
02:31:18,458 --> 02:31:21,167
-[laughs]
-[Vaembu crying]

2711
02:31:27,208 --> 02:31:28,750
[Gaaji] Bro, is sir in there?

2712
02:31:28,833 --> 02:31:30,375
[gangster] Just leave the TV
and go.

2713
02:31:30,458 --> 02:31:32,667
[Gaaji] We can't! But we can explain.

2714
02:31:32,875 --> 02:31:33,708
[gangster] What?

2715
02:31:33,833 --> 02:31:34,958
[Idi Ameen] Hey, comrades!

2716
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:37,292
Bring the TV in.

2717
02:31:37,375 --> 02:31:40,333
Sir, if I don't take the
TV home today, we are screwed.

2718
02:31:40,500 --> 02:31:42,875
We were totally broke this morning,

2719
02:31:42,958 --> 02:31:44,500
yet we managed to buy a TV.

2720
02:31:44,583 --> 02:31:47,417
Trust us. We'll replace yours tomorrow.

2721
02:31:47,708 --> 02:31:51,208
But why should I wait a whole day
to watch "That 70's Show?"

2722
02:31:53,125 --> 02:31:54,042
[Vasanth] Sir!

2723
02:31:55,333 --> 02:31:57,542
Today, you would have been getting
a 48-inch TV.

2724
02:31:58,292 --> 02:32:00,042
Tomorrow, you'll get a 55-inch TV.

2725
02:32:00,125 --> 02:32:01,333
[Thooyavan] Dude!

2726
02:32:03,375 --> 02:32:04,417
[Idi Ameen] Amazing.

2727
02:32:08,833 --> 02:32:11,250
[engine whirring]

2728
02:32:14,875 --> 02:32:17,167
[Vasanth] Dude, will your dad
be thrilled to see two televisions?

2729
02:32:17,375 --> 02:32:19,083
[Thooyavan] It would be disastrous!

2730
02:32:19,333 --> 02:32:22,083
We have to throw the old TV
in a place where no one will ever find it.

2731
02:32:22,375 --> 02:32:24,625
My dad’s a poisonous snake.

2732
02:32:24,875 --> 02:32:26,250
Word is that he is a karate expert.

2733
02:32:26,333 --> 02:32:27,375
He said so himself.

2734
02:32:59,958 --> 02:33:02,750
[Thooyavan] If we somehow scrape
together the money,

2735
02:33:02,958 --> 02:33:04,333
and get Sunny Leone to Madras,

2736
02:33:04,417 --> 02:33:06,167
we can get the northie girl
to make her into two.

2737
02:33:06,250 --> 02:33:07,250
And we can keep one with us.

2738
02:33:08,917 --> 02:33:10,625
[Gaaji] Okay. Three copies.

2739
02:33:10,875 --> 02:33:12,458
We get one each. That will be fair.

2740
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:16,125
[Thooyavan and Vasanth] One, two, three!

2741
02:33:19,500 --> 02:33:22,167
[Gaaji] Dude, we've been through
so much in one day.

2742
02:33:22,292 --> 02:33:24,417
We watch a porn film,
and find a friend’s mom in it.

2743
02:33:24,667 --> 02:33:26,542
We even went to the
extent of poisoning a man.

2744
02:33:26,833 --> 02:33:31,083
We decide to steal, and we meet an alien!

2745
02:33:31,875 --> 02:33:33,125
[Gaaji] But you know what?

2746
02:33:33,500 --> 02:33:34,375
[Thooyavan] What?

2747
02:33:34,833 --> 02:33:35,667
Beautifuck!

2748
02:33:35,833 --> 02:33:37,250
[Thooyavan] We haven't watched porn yet.

2749
02:33:37,375 --> 02:33:39,625
Can't you think out of your boxers?

2750
02:33:39,958 --> 02:33:43,250
Hey! It was my horniness
that got you a new TV.

2751
02:33:43,500 --> 02:33:45,125
Better take me to a porn flick.

2752
02:33:46,083 --> 02:33:47,292
Mmm.

2753
02:33:54,042 --> 02:33:55,708
[Thooyavan] Dude, what the fuck is this?

2754
02:33:55,875 --> 02:33:58,042
[Gaaji] Just park your bike and come on.

2755
02:34:00,125 --> 02:34:01,417
This film is layered.

2756
02:34:01,625 --> 02:34:03,625
It starts off by ranting
about the beauty of life,

2757
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:05,125
then it takes a U-turn and says

2758
02:34:05,208 --> 02:34:07,125
"the most important of
all things in life is sex."

2759
02:34:07,208 --> 02:34:11,417
Like in sexcapade columns where the writer
describes the sexual act in great detail,

2760
02:34:11,583 --> 02:34:13,542
and then ends it with a
"These are all my misadventures,

2761
02:34:13,708 --> 02:34:15,708
don't try them in your life" note.

2762
02:34:15,917 --> 02:34:18,375
It's the same technique, only reversed.
But a good try, nevertheless.

2763
02:34:18,750 --> 02:34:21,250
[Vasanth] Gaaji, how is it that
you seem to know everything?

2764
02:34:22,083 --> 02:34:22,917
[Gaaji] Yes.

2765
02:34:23,042 --> 02:34:24,583
I already saw this film last week.

2766
02:34:26,125 --> 02:34:28,208
Mmm.
[grunts]

2767
02:34:29,958 --> 02:34:30,958
[police 3] Go ahead.

2768
02:34:33,417 --> 02:34:35,333
You have to tell them. Just go ahead.

2769
02:34:43,542 --> 02:34:46,792
You have to face your family
one way or another. Go!

2770
02:35:11,583 --> 02:35:12,875
Raasukutti!

2771
02:35:12,958 --> 02:35:14,292
Raasukutti!

2772
02:35:14,375 --> 02:35:16,417
-[smooches]
-[Raasu Kutti grunts]

2773
02:35:16,625 --> 02:35:17,875
Where did you go?

2774
02:35:18,042 --> 02:35:19,667
Did you know what kind of agony
I went through?

2775
02:35:19,792 --> 02:35:21,333
Why did you run away? I felt so helpless.

2776
02:35:21,417 --> 02:35:22,792
[Raasu Kutti grunts]

2777
02:35:22,875 --> 02:35:24,250
You just vanished without a trace.

2778
02:35:24,958 --> 02:35:27,625
My heart broke into a million pieces,
Raasu Kutti.

2779
02:35:28,375 --> 02:35:31,292
[Shilpa] Did you even think of the trauma
I would go through?

2780
02:35:31,375 --> 02:35:33,083
[grunting]

2781
02:35:33,167 --> 02:35:35,042
That's exactly what we have been
suffering, asshole!

2782
02:35:35,125 --> 02:35:36,083
[Shilpa sighs]

2783
02:35:36,167 --> 02:35:40,792
[Raasu Kutti] Did you think of the trauma
that we had gone through?

2784
02:35:42,250 --> 02:35:45,292
[breathing heavily]

2785
02:35:49,750 --> 02:35:51,917
[grunting]

2786
02:36:10,333 --> 02:36:11,833
Forgive me, Raasu Kutti!

2787
02:36:14,625 --> 02:36:17,208
I didn't think of you or your pain.

2788
02:36:18,375 --> 02:36:19,375
[sobbing]

2789
02:36:19,792 --> 02:36:21,292
I never acknowledged your existence.

2790
02:36:21,958 --> 02:36:24,500
I didn't realize that my child
would bring me to my knees with his love,

2791
02:36:24,625 --> 02:36:26,375
and crush me with questions.

2792
02:36:27,625 --> 02:36:28,542
Raasu Kutti.

2793
02:36:29,667 --> 02:36:31,500
[Raasu Kutti] When you were paying
for the beeda,

2794
02:36:31,583 --> 02:36:34,125
I saw the ticket you bought
at Sunil’s dad’s travel agency.

2795
02:36:35,167 --> 02:36:37,542
How can you think of abandoning us again?

2796
02:36:37,625 --> 02:36:39,125
How could you be so stone hearted?

2797
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,208
I acted on an impulse.
I wasn't thinking straight.

2798
02:36:47,667 --> 02:36:49,458
[Raasu Kutti] No, you did.

2799
02:36:49,667 --> 02:36:52,417
Everybody is mocking you,
so you wanted to run away.

2800
02:36:52,708 --> 02:36:56,042
but Mom and I accept you
just the way you are!

2801
02:36:58,750 --> 02:37:00,542
[sniffles]

2802
02:37:03,083 --> 02:37:05,292
Did you think that only
your life was difficult?

2803
02:37:05,708 --> 02:37:08,458
[Raasu Kutti] Be a man or be a woman,

2804
02:37:08,750 --> 02:37:11,500
just be with us. Damn it!

2805
02:37:11,583 --> 02:37:12,542
[all sobbing]

2806
02:37:23,167 --> 02:37:26,000
I will never leave you again, Raasu Kutti!

2807
02:37:26,583 --> 02:37:27,750
Never!

2808
02:37:28,042 --> 02:37:30,833
[Raasu Kutti] You'll definitely run away
when I go to sleep,

2809
02:37:30,958 --> 02:37:31,958
just like before.

2810
02:37:32,958 --> 02:37:34,500
No, I won’t.
[sobbing]

2811
02:37:42,958 --> 02:37:46,208
[whimpering]

2812
02:37:51,708 --> 02:37:53,500
[crying]

2813
02:37:55,250 --> 02:37:56,958
[door opens]

2814
02:37:57,292 --> 02:37:58,500
Mmm. Hmm.

2815
02:37:59,375 --> 02:38:00,875
[smooches]

2816
02:38:06,083 --> 02:38:07,583
[Raasu Kutti] Hold on... one second.

2817
02:38:07,833 --> 02:38:10,083
I wanted to do something special
when you first walked in.

2818
02:38:10,167 --> 02:38:11,208
I still want to.

2819
02:38:18,542 --> 02:38:19,958
[Raasu Kutti] Say "ding dong"!

2820
02:38:20,500 --> 02:38:21,542
[Vaembu] Huh?

2821
02:38:22,208 --> 02:38:23,792
[Raasu Kutti] Say "ding dong"!

2822
02:38:29,375 --> 02:38:30,583
Ding dong.

2823
02:38:30,667 --> 02:38:32,042
[Raasu Kutti imitates drum]

2824
02:38:32,750 --> 02:38:33,833
[laughs]

2825
02:38:40,542 --> 02:38:41,625
[smooches]

2826
02:38:42,208 --> 02:38:45,208
My sugar, my little god!

2827
02:38:47,250 --> 02:38:48,625
[smooches]

2828
02:38:51,958 --> 02:38:53,083
What shall we do now?

2829
02:38:53,250 --> 02:38:56,000
Let's get ice cream and watch TV, Shilpa.

2830
02:38:56,083 --> 02:38:57,500
[chuckles]

2831
02:39:04,292 --> 02:39:06,750
[Berlin] Here. Take it!

2832
02:39:08,583 --> 02:39:09,792
Go!

2833
02:39:10,708 --> 02:39:11,917
I said go!

2834
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:14,292
It might seem hard at first,

2835
02:39:14,625 --> 02:39:16,167
but you'll get used to it.

2836
02:39:17,375 --> 02:39:19,958
Hey! Who am I kidding? You are a pro.

2837
02:39:20,042 --> 02:39:21,708
-Then what's the problem?
-[sobbing]

2838
02:39:23,958 --> 02:39:25,708
Hold out your hands, dude.

2839
02:39:26,792 --> 02:39:28,167
Do it, man!

2840
02:39:28,583 --> 02:39:29,958
Now you put it on!

2841
02:39:32,667 --> 02:39:34,042
Lock it.

2842
02:39:36,833 --> 02:39:38,458
[Berlin] Put your hand through the window.

2843
02:39:38,583 --> 02:39:39,833
Do it!

2844
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:44,250
You go, girl.

2845
02:39:44,542 --> 02:39:45,958
You just agreed to do this.

2846
02:39:46,125 --> 02:39:47,417
What's with the hesitation?

2847
02:39:47,500 --> 02:39:50,500
The human mind is still a monkey.
It keeps shifting.

2848
02:39:51,208 --> 02:39:54,417
Yeah, right! Hold hands, lovers...
let me get out of your way.

2849
02:39:54,750 --> 02:39:56,417
Dude! You put the other hand through!

2850
02:40:00,875 --> 02:40:01,958
Lock it, babe!

2851
02:40:02,125 --> 02:40:03,167
[Mugil] Sir!

2852
02:40:03,500 --> 02:40:05,000
I'll shoot you in the mouth!

2853
02:40:05,125 --> 02:40:06,458
[Berlin] Turn away!

2854
02:40:06,542 --> 02:40:08,250
[Vaembu sobbing]

2855
02:40:09,708 --> 02:40:13,542
There's no hurry. Slowly. Cool!

2856
02:40:14,208 --> 02:40:17,292
[Berlin] Dude, show me your hands.

2857
02:40:19,250 --> 02:40:20,417
Sweetie.

2858
02:40:20,792 --> 02:40:22,042
Come!

2859
02:40:22,458 --> 02:40:24,292
-Come, chicklet!
-[Vaembu] Mugil!

2860
02:40:24,375 --> 02:40:25,667
[Berlin] Piglet.

2861
02:40:25,750 --> 02:40:28,083
[crying]

2862
02:40:28,167 --> 02:40:29,958
[wailing]

2863
02:40:31,542 --> 02:40:32,917
[Mugil] Sir! Sir!

2864
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:34,417
[Berlin] Turn around, man!

2865
02:40:34,500 --> 02:40:35,875
You're not supposed to watch!

2866
02:40:35,958 --> 02:40:36,875
Turn!

2867
02:40:37,500 --> 02:40:38,667
You come here.

2868
02:40:38,917 --> 02:40:39,750
Come, dear!

2869
02:40:39,875 --> 02:40:41,250
[Mugil] Sir! Sir!

2870
02:40:41,375 --> 02:40:43,833
-[Berlin] Go over to that side.
-[Mugil] Sir! Sir!

2871
02:40:43,917 --> 02:40:45,583
[Vaembu whimpering]

2872
02:40:47,917 --> 02:40:50,125
[Mugil] Sir, please! Don't do this!
Sir, please!

2873
02:40:50,208 --> 02:40:51,375
Vaembu!

2874
02:40:51,958 --> 02:40:54,875
[Mugil] Sir! Please don't do this!

2875
02:40:55,667 --> 02:40:58,333
Sir, please, sir!

2876
02:40:58,417 --> 02:40:59,583
Sir! Sir!

2877
02:40:59,667 --> 02:41:02,417
-You call me with such longing.
-Sir!

2878
02:41:02,583 --> 02:41:04,917
It looks like I need to rent
a pleasure pad for you as well!

2879
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:06,042
[laughs]

2880
02:41:09,875 --> 02:41:11,708
[Berlin laughs]

2881
02:41:14,792 --> 02:41:16,625
Just kidding!

2882
02:41:20,083 --> 02:41:22,292
[Berlin] Don't worry. Our first time is

2883
02:41:22,375 --> 02:41:23,542
happening in such a filthy place.

2884
02:41:24,042 --> 02:41:27,042
-Our situation is like that.
-[Vaembu] Mugil!

2885
02:41:27,625 --> 02:41:30,458
But I do promise,
the future will be a riot.

2886
02:41:30,542 --> 02:41:31,667
[sobbing]

2887
02:41:31,875 --> 02:41:33,500
[Berlin] We could even do it in the car,

2888
02:41:33,708 --> 02:41:35,667
but that Mugil will be staring at us...

2889
02:41:35,750 --> 02:41:37,542
-I am one of the shy types, you see.
-[Mugil] Sir!

2890
02:41:37,625 --> 02:41:41,000
-[Mugil] Sir, sir!
-[Vaembu] Mugil!

2891
02:41:41,083 --> 02:41:42,375
-Hey!
-[Mugil] Sir!

2892
02:41:42,458 --> 02:41:45,833
Pervert! Look away! Ahh.

2893
02:41:47,958 --> 02:41:50,333
Let's record this, shall we?

2894
02:41:50,417 --> 02:41:51,292
Mugil!
[sobbing]

2895
02:41:51,375 --> 02:41:53,667
-[Berlin] Good video quality on this one.
-[Mugil] Sir! Sir! Sir!

2896
02:41:53,750 --> 02:41:55,792
-Supreme clarity!
-Sir! Sir, please, sir!

2897
02:41:56,583 --> 02:41:57,667
[Mugil] Sir!

2898
02:41:58,042 --> 02:42:02,167
-One may do it a million times.
-[Mugil] Sir, please leave her!

2899
02:42:02,250 --> 02:42:04,667
-The emotion of the first time is divine!
-[Mugil] Sir, please, sir!

2900
02:42:04,750 --> 02:42:06,583
-Huh?
-No, sir! Stop!

2901
02:42:06,667 --> 02:42:07,833
[Berlin] Maybe you'll want to

2902
02:42:07,917 --> 02:42:09,458
-relive these moments.
-[Mugil] Please, sir!

2903
02:42:09,542 --> 02:42:11,708
-Then you will thank me for the video.
-Sir!

2904
02:42:11,958 --> 02:42:15,375
-[laughs]
-Sir! Sir! Sir!

2905
02:42:15,458 --> 02:42:16,917
-[Berlin] Go further back...
-[Mugil] Sir!

2906
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:18,583
-Yes, just like that.
-Vaembu!

2907
02:42:18,667 --> 02:42:21,125
Please, sir. Sir! Sir!

2908
02:42:21,917 --> 02:42:23,333
Further back, pumpkin.

2909
02:42:23,875 --> 02:42:25,792
You might complain that your face
won't be seen.

2910
02:42:26,542 --> 02:42:28,583
Keep going, darling.

2911
02:42:29,167 --> 02:42:30,542
[Berlin] Go, go, go.

2912
02:42:30,625 --> 02:42:33,042
-I don't understand why you're crying.
-[Mugil] Sir!

2913
02:42:33,625 --> 02:42:36,167
-[Berlin] A little back, dear.
-Sir!

2914
02:42:36,333 --> 02:42:38,833
-Mugil! Mugil! Mugil!
-[Mugil] Sir!

2915
02:42:39,500 --> 02:42:41,500
-[Berlin] Move to the right.
-[Mugil] Don't do this, sir!
