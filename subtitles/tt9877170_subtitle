1
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:36,833
<i>Waiting for him</i>

2
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:41,708
<i>To arrive tonight</i>

3
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:48,083
<i>Just a little longer</i>

4
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:51,291
<i>Waiting for him</i>

5
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:56,833
<i>To arrive tonight</i>

6
00:05:56,916 --> 00:06:00,375
<i>Let him arrive, my restless heart</i>

7
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:04,708
<i>You can shower all your love</i>

8
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:07,583
<i>Shubu, shubu, shubu, shubu</i>

9
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,708
<i>Shubu</i>

10
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,916
<i>Shubu, Shubu, Shubu, Shubu</i>

11
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,083
<i>Shubu</i>

12
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,416
-You have style.
-What style?

13
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,666
Goa isn't what it used to be, Tony.

14
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:39,500
Earlier there were Russians, Europeans.

15
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,166
-Israelis.
-Israelis who would come here.

16
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:45,375
Eat one meal, smoke weed, get high.

17
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:47,458
But one meal is never good for business.

18
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:49,291
Not good at all.

19
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:52,208
Ever since those
<i>Dil Chahta Hai</i> boys came here

20
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,541
and clicked pictures at Chapora Fort,

21
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:57,083
every Indian has been flocking to Goa.

22
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,291
Goa meaning, Dude Alley.

23
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,333
Dude Alley.

24
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,416
But one good thing about Indian
tourists is, they come with family.

25
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:08,083
Wife, kids, or even parents.

26
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,625
Separately...
But they have three meals a day.

27
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:12,416
And eat their fill.

28
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,125
So even small-time bar owners
build family restaurants.

29
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,875
And even I took advantage
of the situation.

30
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,666
You didn't just take advantage.

31
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:24,958
You built an empire around it.

32
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,000
Listen.

33
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,625
Remember Feroz,
the guy that worked with you.

34
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:36,833
What's the deal with him?

35
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,208
Look, I brought him here from Bihar.

36
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,250
Gave him a job.

37
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:46,791
Gave him a salary.

38
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,000
I put food on his plate.

39
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,333
A place to stay.
He said he wants to bring his family over.

40
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:53,791
I helped them all settle down.

41
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:58,416
One day I said,
these tourists that come here,

42
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,500
serve them beer,

43
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,916
and give them a chance to try something.

44
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:05,625
You mean try?

45
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,916
He refused.

46
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,125
He said it's immoral.

47
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,958
I said, to hell with intentions.
I'm telling you to do it.

48
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm your boss. I say do it.
He said <i>no</i>.

49
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:19,000
And I slapped him.

50
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,750
Later he threatens me
that he'll go to the police

51
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:24,416
and he'll tell them about me,
ten years of my effort will go waste.

52
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,791
So I killed him.

53
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,208
He must be there...

54
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:30,125
-Where's the body?
-Dumped it in Dudhsagar Falls.

55
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:34,041
His wife thinks he ran away
with some foreigner.

56
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,916
Who cares about the family?

57
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,208
But the restaurant
should never close down.

58
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,000
You bro, are a great man.

59
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:49,750
But let me tell you

60
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,500
my family's coming over.

61
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,458
It's Christmas eve after all.

62
00:08:58,583 --> 00:08:59,791
My family's coming.

63
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:04,291
My wife, my parents, kids.

64
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,291
And for Baby John...

65
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,708
Come on, Borkar, time to go to work.
Save me, Lord!

66
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,416
Check him.
See if he's dead or not.

67
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:25,666
Checking.

68
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,166
He's still alive.

69
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:38,250
The gun we seized yesterday
at the raid, put it in his hand.

70
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,375
And wipe the fingerprints with a wet wipe.

71
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,333
We killers never have
our heart in the right place.

72
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:05,458
<i>Shubu, Shubu, Shubu, Shubu</i>

73
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:07,750
<i>Shubu</i>

74
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:12,333
<i>Shubu, Shubu, Shubu, Shubu</i>

75
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,333
Wants to run a family restaurant.

76
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,375
SHO Agashe.

77
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,000
I want to report a murder, sir.

78
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,833
Inform your local police station.

79
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,416
It hasn't happened yet,
I am about to do it.

80
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,416
You dog.

81
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:39,791
It's Christmas eve and not
April Fool's day. Don't try to fool me.

82
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,625
It's going to be a very long night.

83
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,208
Happy Solstice.

84
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,083
What? Hello.

85
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:49,833
<i>Hello.</i>

86
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:59,125
Father, find someone like Michael
for my sister as well.

87
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:05,416
A match like Michael and Teresa
are only made in heaven.

88
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:11,458
Catholic values, respect for the church,
they are not made anymore.

89
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,625
After 15 long years, she is pregnant.

90
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:29,166
I've taken his contact number.

91
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,416
When Teresa and Bonnie were growing up,

92
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,375
we were afraid that Bonnie
would have to join the merchant navy.

93
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,916
-Come on.
-But look now,

94
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,750
he's home for at least
three months in a year.

95
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:55,208
And our family's growing.

96
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,500
I'll check on the cake.

97
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,666
Supper's ready. Everyone's waiting.

98
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:08,416
Teresa.

99
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,125
There's something I wanted to tell you.

100
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,291
What?

101
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:16,250
I...

102
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,875
Sorry to disturb you all.
Is Mr. Michael at home?

103
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:28,416
Michael.

104
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,500
I have to meet him regarding a case.

105
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,416
You don't have to remember everything,
but always remember one thing.

106
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:00,541
Sir.

107
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,500
Cause of death,
blunt force trauma to the head.

108
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,291
He was subjected to many more
such wounds before he was killed.

109
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:09,291
Seems like the motive was robbery.
There's extensive damage.

110
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,666
We're still making
a list of missing items.

111
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:14,541
It's not a robbery.

112
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,083
Thieves don't announce their arrival.

113
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,500
The victim's name is Victor Ferns.

114
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:23,791
DSP, Special Cell.

115
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,291
He was an officer from your department.

116
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:28,750
I know.

117
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:31,291
He was a friend.

118
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,291
But one thing still puzzles me.

119
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,666
The destruction left behind
doesn't look like one man's job.

120
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,416
Seems like there were
at least half a dozen men.

121
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,416
This is the job of one man, Pandey.

122
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,791
But you must say there
were at least half a dozen.

123
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,375
Otherwise, people will laugh at you.

124
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:51,000
One guy took out a Special Cell officer.

125
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,166
Look at how he hung him, Borkar.

126
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,208
Yes, sir.

127
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:58,083
Like one hangs a medal on the wall.

128
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:01,416
-He enjoyed killing him. Right? Right.
-Yes, sir.

129
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,541
This is personal.

130
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,708
The victim was from Special Cell.
From my team.

131
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:08,958
And this is our case.

132
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,750
We don't need the Crime Branch.

133
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,541
I came for a stroll after dinner.

134
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,458
You see, the murderer called me
before committing the crime

135
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,291
and said he's going to kill someone.

136
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:22,333
And I thought I should check whether
he was joking or if it was a challenge.

137
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,583
It turned out to be a challenge.

138
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,083
And you know...

139
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:28,916
Agashe loves a challenge.

140
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,291
Everyone knows about you, Agashe.

141
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:39,375
Your "Redemption by instant justice"
won't work here.

142
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:46,291
Do you have a rupee, Pandey?
Give it to me.

143
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,083
I am in mood of giving advice.

144
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:49,666
But I never give it for free.

145
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:52,458
And if I charge for my advice,
people will think I am corrupt.

146
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:58,041
Take my advice and keep yourself
busy with the facts.

147
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,791
Because whoever did this
is not an ordinary killer.

148
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,833
He's a monster.

149
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,500
One can strike fear

150
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,458
only when he fears nothing.

151
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:27,666
Make you suffer to death
when one's lost something himself.

152
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:45,041
This is not the end,
it's just the beginning.

153
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,250
Wait and watch,

154
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,208
tonight is going to be
one of the darkest nights.

155
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,208
And the silence will be deafening.

156
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:17,250
<i>The caravan has set out</i>

157
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,791
<i>On this journey</i>

158
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:23,333
<i>The caravan has set out</i>

159
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:26,375
<i>On this journey</i>

160
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:31,541
<i>No strings attached</i>
<i>No place to be</i>

161
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:34,541
<i>I want to be vagrant</i>
<i>Vagrant, vagrant</i>

162
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:37,625
<i>I want to be vagrant</i>
<i>Vagrant, vagrant</i>

163
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:40,916
<i>I want to be vagrant</i>
<i>Vagrant, vagrant</i>

164
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:44,875
<i>Vagrant</i>

165
00:17:57,083 --> 00:18:00,208
<i>Like an ascetic</i>

166
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:02,875
<i>My heart wanders around</i>

167
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,291
<i>Like an ascetic</i>

168
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:09,375
<i>My heart wanders around</i>

169
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:14,625
<i>Where will fate take me next?</i>

170
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:17,416
<i>I want to be vagrant</i>
<i>Vagrant, vagrant</i>

171
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,375
<i>I want to be vagrant</i>

172
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:23,791
<i>I want to be vagrant</i>

173
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:27,666
<i>Vagrant</i>

174
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:55,791
<i>There's wind beneath my feet</i>

175
00:18:55,916 --> 00:19:00,208
<i>Nothing can hold me down</i>

176
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:08,083
<i>There's wind beneath my feet</i>

177
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:11,166
<i>Nothing can hold me down</i>

178
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,291
<i>I've left the shores far behind</i>

179
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:17,458
<i>To go as far as</i>
<i>I can with the tide</i>

180
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:23,375
<i>The days keep passing by</i>

181
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:28,291
<i>The roads may end</i>
<i>But not the journey</i>

182
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:31,250
<i>I want to be vagrant</i>
<i>Vagrant, vagrant</i>

183
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:34,375
<i>I want to be vagrant</i>
<i>Vagrant, vagrant</i>

184
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:37,625
<i>I want to be vagrant</i>
<i>Vagrant, vagrant</i>

185
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:41,583
<i>Vagrant</i>

186
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:34,083
-Police!
-It's the police. Police!

187
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:08,291
-Stop. Catch him.
-Come on. Let's go.

188
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:20,833
Are police raids a regular thing here?

189
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:25,416
Someone must have tipped them off
that they are selling stuff in there.

190
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,958
Stuff?

191
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,500
I mean, there must be a
party happening somewhere around.

192
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:43,000
Come on, it's just ten o'clock
and the night is still young.

193
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:04,458
It is that way.

194
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:14,041
Check where can we find one.

195
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,333
What? Washroom?

196
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,708
Ecs.

197
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,166
It should be available here.

198
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:29,041
Listen, I'll go talk to that guy.

199
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:30,958
Wait here. Don't go anywhere.

200
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,833
Hey, Costa.

201
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,000
What are you looking for?

202
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:24,083
Peace or pleasure?

203
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:34,916
We don't want anything, let's go.

204
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,666
Are you two together?

205
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:42,166
Yeah.

206
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:44,625
Temporary or permanent?

207
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:49,125
We haven't decided yet.

208
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:55,250
This one's on me.

209
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,958
Stay together, okay?

210
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,916
That's all.

211
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,291
We'll split one pill into two halves.

212
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:22,500
It's too strong.

213
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:25,708
Life means choices.

214
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:29,333
Either you are in or out.

215
00:25:37,958 --> 00:25:40,916
<i>I found myself</i>

216
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,333
<i>Since I found you</i>

217
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:53,250
<i>I found myself</i>

218
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:56,000
<i>Since I found you</i>

219
00:25:56,083 --> 00:26:02,583
<i>In this world of illusion</i>
<i>I found my destiny in you</i>

220
00:26:02,666 --> 00:26:08,416
<i>The night is fading away</i>
<i>And the dawn is yet to come</i>

221
00:26:08,708 --> 00:26:11,250
<i>I am losing faith in You</i>

222
00:26:11,708 --> 00:26:13,416
<i>As you have become my religion</i>

223
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,625
<i>I want to be vagrant</i>
<i>Vagrant, vagrant</i>

224
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:19,708
<i>I want to be vagrant</i>
<i>Vagrant, vagrant</i>

225
00:26:19,791 --> 00:26:23,125
<i>I want to be vagrant</i>
<i>Vagrant, vagrant</i>

226
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:26,875
<i>Vagrant</i>

227
00:27:46,208 --> 00:27:47,958
Is this thread and these knots special?

228
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:54,166
This thread is me,
and each knot is for each of my fears.

229
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,875
Every fear that I want to overcome.

230
00:27:57,958 --> 00:27:58,875
Like?

231
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:03,416
Like just trying everything.

232
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:07,375
Like meeting a stranger and having wild...

233
00:28:09,666 --> 00:28:11,083
-I see.
-Thanks.

234
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:14,916
So I was just a knot on some thread.

235
00:28:19,458 --> 00:28:20,333
And the rest?

236
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:21,916
The rest...

237
00:28:22,583 --> 00:28:24,416
I'm going to do everything
I've never done before.

238
00:28:42,833 --> 00:28:44,291
I'm in Goa for a few more days.

239
00:28:44,375 --> 00:28:46,208
And then I'm planning to go to Gokarna.

240
00:28:46,916 --> 00:28:50,083
After that I'm going North, I think.
To a place called Tosh.

241
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,666
Go to different places,
meet different people.

242
00:29:57,125 --> 00:29:59,000
Post mortem says that the victim
was given an overdose

243
00:29:59,083 --> 00:30:00,458
of the flakka drug.

244
00:30:00,541 --> 00:30:02,875
<i>-And evidence?</i>
-We have a lead from narcotics.

245
00:30:06,958 --> 00:30:07,833
<i>And dealer?</i>

246
00:30:07,916 --> 00:30:10,166
The dealer's name is Nicholas Obado.

247
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:13,416
Sir, he just got in.

248
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,250
<i>A police officer's been murdered, Michael.</i>

249
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:17,416
<i>This is very embarrassing</i>
<i>for the Department.</i>

250
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,583
<i>The case should be solved immediately.</i>

251
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:40,708
So let me teach you a thing
or two about Hindi.

252
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:46,166
Come on, Mr. Pandey.
You guys never eat.

253
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,750
Come on everyone, let's go.

254
00:30:47,833 --> 00:30:48,916
Come, Mr. Pandey.

255
00:30:50,875 --> 00:30:52,333
How was aunt's plum cake?

256
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:54,041
-Come on, Borkar.
-Eat it.

257
00:30:54,125 --> 00:30:55,041
Here you go.

258
00:30:55,125 --> 00:30:56,416
-Take it.
-No. Thank you.

259
00:30:57,416 --> 00:30:58,958
You have some.

260
00:30:59,041 --> 00:30:59,916
Plum cake.

261
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,375
End of the broadcast.

262
00:31:13,791 --> 00:31:15,291
Multipurpose tool.

263
00:31:22,125 --> 00:31:24,458
Can be used as a hammer. What?

264
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,375
You...

265
00:31:28,458 --> 00:31:30,750
Can also be used as a screwdriver?

266
00:31:30,916 --> 00:31:32,708
What?

267
00:31:35,458 --> 00:31:36,958
Your boss is done for.

268
00:31:37,625 --> 00:31:41,875
And if I shove this up your back,
what do we call it?

269
00:31:42,916 --> 00:31:46,041
-What do we call it?
-Leave him.

270
00:31:48,666 --> 00:31:51,583
Bullying is their job.
The cops don't do that.

271
00:31:52,291 --> 00:31:53,791
Learn to follow the system.

272
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,041
Sir.

273
00:31:57,375 --> 00:31:58,708
I beg you.

274
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,375
Tell us, please.

275
00:32:01,875 --> 00:32:03,166
Who did you sell the drugs to?

276
00:32:03,833 --> 00:32:04,833
Tell us.

277
00:32:05,166 --> 00:32:07,291
Tell us.

278
00:32:09,791 --> 00:32:11,083
This is Agashe's style.

279
00:32:11,625 --> 00:32:14,541
This is Agashe's style.
This is Agashe's style.

280
00:32:25,541 --> 00:32:26,458
Shoot.

281
00:32:30,541 --> 00:32:31,375
Shoot.

282
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,666
Shoot.

283
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:41,458
Shoot!

284
00:32:44,541 --> 00:32:46,083
I got a call.

285
00:32:46,583 --> 00:32:47,833
She paid extra.

286
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:51,375
It was a white girl, dreadlocks.

287
00:32:51,458 --> 00:32:52,750
Tattoos as well.

288
00:32:53,666 --> 00:32:55,166
That's the truth.

289
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,208
I got a call.

290
00:33:04,875 --> 00:33:06,375
Paid me extra.

291
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,791
That's the truth. I swear.

292
00:33:10,541 --> 00:33:13,333
You can speak Marathi as well.

293
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:14,416
Yes.

294
00:33:26,125 --> 00:33:27,916
Tap all your informers
in the hippie circuit.

295
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Okay, sir.

296
00:33:29,916 --> 00:33:32,750
-Pandey, inform control room.
-Yes, sir.

297
00:33:32,916 --> 00:33:35,000
In the CCTV footage from Victor's society,

298
00:33:35,083 --> 00:33:36,875
they spotted someone in a red hoodie.

299
00:33:36,958 --> 00:33:39,458
-He can speak Marathi as well.
-Are you serious?

300
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,666
-Michael.
-What, Pandey?

301
00:33:42,916 --> 00:33:44,583
You knew my gun was empty.

302
00:33:45,166 --> 00:33:46,083
No.

303
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:48,625
I didn't know.

304
00:33:50,916 --> 00:33:53,291
-Keith.
-Sir. The phone's switched off.

305
00:33:53,375 --> 00:33:57,208
We can't trace the device
until he doesn't turn it back on.

306
00:33:57,791 --> 00:34:00,166
-Give this to some poor man.
-Okay, sir.

307
00:34:00,541 --> 00:34:02,583
-There's a phone number on it.
-Goa needs police officers like him.

308
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:06,916
-Keith.
-Yes, sir.

309
00:34:07,416 --> 00:34:08,625
There's a number in here.

310
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:11,166
Text me all the details
on my personal number.

311
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,083
Yes, sir.

312
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:13,750
For this case, sir?

313
00:34:14,458 --> 00:34:17,083
-No. Personal.
-Okay, sir.

314
00:34:20,583 --> 00:34:22,666
It's a bizarre job, isn't it, Michael?

315
00:34:23,541 --> 00:34:25,791
Completely messes up your personal life.

316
00:34:29,583 --> 00:34:31,875
Arresting the criminal
means end of the case.

317
00:34:32,708 --> 00:34:33,750
But not the criminal.

318
00:34:35,166 --> 00:34:38,000
He returns someday as your enemy.

319
00:34:39,125 --> 00:34:41,083
As in Victor Fern's case.

320
00:34:42,458 --> 00:34:45,791
I'm sure it was an old enmity.

321
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:47,708
Another assumption.

322
00:34:50,583 --> 00:34:53,416
My friend, Victor, and his family
will get justice.

323
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:55,250
To hell with justice.

324
00:34:55,791 --> 00:34:58,250
You can't amuse families with justice.

325
00:34:58,708 --> 00:35:01,291
What do they want? Revenge?

326
00:35:02,666 --> 00:35:04,041
Always remember, Agashe.

327
00:35:04,791 --> 00:35:07,041
Revenge always leads to two graves,

328
00:35:07,375 --> 00:35:09,000
one of which is your own.

329
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:13,125
5 '11 inches, my height.

330
00:35:13,416 --> 00:35:14,375
Dig one for me.

331
00:35:21,541 --> 00:35:23,625
Sir, it's him.
Calling on your mobile.

332
00:35:29,583 --> 00:35:31,708
<i>You won't get anything</i>
<i>from the drug supplier, sir.</i>

333
00:35:32,916 --> 00:35:34,125
You're only wasting your time.

334
00:35:35,958 --> 00:35:39,083
You should be happy.
We're buying you more time.

335
00:35:39,916 --> 00:35:42,000
I don't know who you are or what you want.

336
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:45,291
But you don't know Agashe

337
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:50,875
-and what he does with killers like you.
-Encounter. Correct?

338
00:35:53,208 --> 00:35:55,416
Killing murderers makes you happy,
doesn't it?

339
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,208
Don't stray from the topic.

340
00:35:57,291 --> 00:35:59,333
<i>Who are you and what do you want?</i>

341
00:35:59,833 --> 00:36:02,250
It's your job to find out who I am.

342
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:05,500
But I'll tell you what I want.

343
00:36:06,708 --> 00:36:07,791
Another police officer.

344
00:36:17,166 --> 00:36:18,625
Sir, he's in Panjim.

345
00:36:18,833 --> 00:36:20,125
There's a carnival in progress
in that area.

346
00:36:20,208 --> 00:36:22,666
And half the Police force
has been deployed there.

347
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,916
All teams move in.
The suspect is in a red hoodie.

348
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:51,000
Greetings.

349
00:36:51,958 --> 00:36:53,208
<i>Suspect is wearing a red hoodie.</i>

350
00:36:53,291 --> 00:36:55,875
If you see anyone in a red hoodie,
then take him into custody.

351
00:36:55,958 --> 00:36:58,041
And tell every police officer
to stay alert.

352
00:36:58,125 --> 00:37:00,708
<i>I am repeating again.</i>
<i>Suspect is wearing a red hoodie.</i>

353
00:37:38,791 --> 00:37:39,916
Bastard.

354
00:37:41,625 --> 00:37:43,250
You don't know what you're doing.

355
00:37:43,916 --> 00:37:46,625
I am a cop.
You see what I do to you.

356
00:37:48,041 --> 00:37:50,416
Just watch what I do to you.

357
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,916
Now, you watch.

358
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:30,958
All teams be alert.
Suspect is wearing a red hoodie.

359
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:34,708
Uncle Michael.

360
00:38:40,833 --> 00:38:43,166
-I have a family.
-I don't have one.

361
00:39:31,708 --> 00:39:32,833
Stop.

362
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:38,916
Hey wait, stop. Stop.
Catch him!

363
00:39:58,583 --> 00:39:59,875
-Call for an ambulance, quickly.
-Yes, sir.

364
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,875
Suspect is wearing a red hoodie.
Don't let him escape.

365
00:40:24,958 --> 00:40:26,416
Mark all exits, quickly.

366
00:40:41,375 --> 00:40:42,250
Hey.

367
00:40:48,125 --> 00:40:49,333
Weren't you leaving?

368
00:40:53,916 --> 00:40:55,208
Yeah, I am going.

369
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:06,333
No, I was thinking why don't we open
the knots on your thread together.

370
00:41:20,291 --> 00:41:21,666
Mine or yours?

371
00:41:27,166 --> 00:41:30,000
Like one's weakness is other's strength.

372
00:41:34,666 --> 00:41:37,041
So, did you come to Goa alone,
or with some...

373
00:41:37,916 --> 00:41:39,000
Alone.

374
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:52,416
Listen! Be careful,
this surface isn't strong enough.

375
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,458
I am scared of heights.
And you?

376
00:41:58,291 --> 00:42:00,416
Yeah, definitely,
at this height, I am scared.

377
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:08,416
Not anymore.

378
00:42:25,791 --> 00:42:28,041
You won't be scared of heights anymore.

379
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,166
You can't be afraid
of the same fear twice.

380
00:42:33,791 --> 00:42:35,125
<i>I wonder</i>

381
00:42:36,083 --> 00:42:38,583
<i>What's wrong with my heart</i>

382
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:44,833
<i>Feels like I know you</i>

383
00:42:46,125 --> 00:42:52,041
<i>How do I confess</i>

384
00:42:52,166 --> 00:42:57,208
<i>Whether this is passion or crime?</i>

385
00:42:57,291 --> 00:43:01,250
<i>You arrived in my life</i>

386
00:43:03,375 --> 00:43:07,833
<i>Like the dawn after a dark night</i>

387
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:14,541
<i>I wonder which direction</i>
<i>We are headed</i>

388
00:43:15,666 --> 00:43:20,791
<i>Just do whatever we want</i>

389
00:43:22,875 --> 00:43:26,041
<i>No matter where I go</i>

390
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:28,666
<i>Every path leads only to you</i>

391
00:43:29,083 --> 00:43:31,916
<i>You are my companion</i>

392
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,125
<i>And I am yours</i>

393
00:43:35,208 --> 00:43:38,250
<i>No matter where I go</i>

394
00:43:38,333 --> 00:43:41,458
<i>Every path leads only to you</i>

395
00:43:41,541 --> 00:43:44,208
<i>You are my companion</i>

396
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:47,750
<i>And I am yours</i>

397
00:43:59,208 --> 00:44:05,083
<i>My heart is grateful to you</i>

398
00:44:05,458 --> 00:44:07,916
<i>What is this addiction?</i>

399
00:44:08,416 --> 00:44:11,791
<i>What do I call it?</i>

400
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:15,291
Parents went abroad from India
for a good life.

401
00:44:15,375 --> 00:44:17,083
They worked hard for a good life.

402
00:44:17,208 --> 00:44:21,666
But when they had no life, I realized
that they never lived for themselves.

403
00:44:23,125 --> 00:44:26,708
So I've decided that I'll collect
memories instead of things.

404
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:29,875
How many people?

405
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:34,375
A couple of them.
iMac, iPhone, iPad.

406
00:44:34,458 --> 00:44:36,333
Netflix, PlayStation.

407
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,875
You know how to avoid questions.

408
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:51,208
Come on, let's make a deal.

409
00:44:54,083 --> 00:44:56,333
We'll live only for ourselves.

410
00:44:56,750 --> 00:45:00,750
No friends, no home, no family.

411
00:45:00,875 --> 00:45:05,166
<i>No one else knows</i>

412
00:45:06,875 --> 00:45:11,750
<i>Only you understand me</i>

413
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,875
<i>I've never seen</i>

414
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:20,875
<i>Such insanity</i>

415
00:45:21,541 --> 00:45:24,291
<i>Except for you</i>

416
00:45:24,375 --> 00:45:29,541
<i>My day starts and ends with you</i>

417
00:45:30,291 --> 00:45:35,458
<i>I can't get you out of my sight</i>

418
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:41,708
<i>All my time</i>

419
00:45:42,666 --> 00:45:47,708
<i>Is for only you</i>

420
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
<i>No matter where I go</i>

421
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:56,083
<i>Every path leads only to you</i>

422
00:45:56,208 --> 00:45:59,125
<i>You are my companion</i>

423
00:45:59,208 --> 00:46:01,958
<i>And I am yours</i>

424
00:46:02,375 --> 00:46:05,458
<i>No matter where I go</i>

425
00:46:05,541 --> 00:46:08,208
<i>Every path leads only to you</i>

426
00:46:08,291 --> 00:46:11,125
<i>You are my companion</i>

427
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:14,250
<i>And I am yours</i>

428
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:34,833
You and your camera.

429
00:46:34,916 --> 00:46:37,166
-I had to capture that moment.
-Stop it.

430
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:38,208
But why?

431
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,583
Now, don't tell me
you're not on Instagram.

432
00:46:50,583 --> 00:46:51,875
Then where are you?

433
00:46:54,625 --> 00:46:56,750
I am right in front of you, in person.

434
00:47:09,458 --> 00:47:15,041
<i>My heart is grateful to you</i>

435
00:47:15,125 --> 00:47:18,041
<i>What is this addiction?</i>

436
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:21,500
<i>What do I call it?</i>

437
00:47:21,583 --> 00:47:24,666
<i>The illusion has shattered</i>

438
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:27,416
<i>And I saw the real world</i>

439
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:34,375
<i>My eyes have seen a dream</i>

440
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:40,083
<i>I want to thank you</i>

441
00:47:46,833 --> 00:47:49,875
<i>No matter where I go</i>

442
00:47:49,958 --> 00:47:52,791
<i>Every path leads only to you</i>

443
00:47:52,875 --> 00:47:56,000
<i>You are my companion</i>

444
00:47:56,083 --> 00:47:59,416
<i>And I am yours</i>

445
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:02,208
<i>No matter where I go</i>

446
00:48:02,291 --> 00:48:04,708
<i>Every path leads only to you</i>

447
00:48:05,208 --> 00:48:07,958
<i>You are my companion</i>

448
00:48:08,416 --> 00:48:11,750
<i>And I am yours</i>

449
00:48:14,166 --> 00:48:18,541
<i>I am your companion too</i>

450
00:48:19,333 --> 00:48:23,083
<i>No matter where I go</i>

451
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:29,000
<i>My heart is grateful to you</i>

452
00:48:29,083 --> 00:48:32,250
<i>What is this addiction?</i>

453
00:48:32,333 --> 00:48:36,083
<i>What do I call it?</i>

454
00:48:54,708 --> 00:48:55,750
Medicine...

455
00:48:57,583 --> 00:48:58,625
I don't know.

456
00:49:26,291 --> 00:49:28,166
You carry a needle
in case of an overdose, huh.

457
00:49:28,708 --> 00:49:29,958
What to do, bro?

458
00:49:30,333 --> 00:49:32,291
There is no one else to take care of me.

459
00:49:32,583 --> 00:49:33,958
I have to do that myself.

460
00:49:34,625 --> 00:49:36,458
Why? We're here for you.

461
00:49:36,541 --> 00:49:38,500
And what happened to your friends?

462
00:49:45,708 --> 00:49:47,041
Mika was a client.

463
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:52,916
These drugs, parties,

464
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,750
I offer myself to buy these pleasures.

465
00:50:06,208 --> 00:50:08,958
Just like you two,
I came to Goa a couple of years ago.

466
00:50:12,166 --> 00:50:13,208
Handful of money.

467
00:50:15,041 --> 00:50:16,375
And lots of confidence.

468
00:50:19,083 --> 00:50:20,750
But I got so addicted to all this

469
00:50:21,833 --> 00:50:23,833
that I ended up with
no money and no confidence.

470
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:32,583
And now this addiction and this world
has become a home for me.

471
00:50:35,083 --> 00:50:39,583
In fact, I have a feeling and I know
that this lifestyle will kill me someday.

472
00:50:42,333 --> 00:50:43,875
So totally prepped.

473
00:50:46,041 --> 00:50:49,958
Addiction to stay away from life
and this medicine to stay away from death.

474
00:50:51,125 --> 00:50:52,916
I am just running all the time.

475
00:51:02,458 --> 00:51:05,291
We all want freedom in life.

476
00:51:06,375 --> 00:51:09,125
No objections, no restrictions.

477
00:51:09,958 --> 00:51:11,583
Free to do whatever we want.

478
00:51:18,666 --> 00:51:21,500
We all want fun, but no peace.

479
00:51:23,708 --> 00:51:25,125
Peace...

480
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:29,166
Jesse needs some peace.

481
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:49,583
You tell me.

482
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:52,083
What is peace for you?

483
00:51:56,333 --> 00:51:57,583
Never gave it a thought.

484
00:51:58,291 --> 00:51:59,500
So think now.

485
00:52:09,375 --> 00:52:11,166
Back home, with mom and dad.

486
00:52:15,666 --> 00:52:18,708
Dad would, every year,
plan a surprise for mom.

487
00:52:18,791 --> 00:52:21,541
And every year he would
plan the same surprise.

488
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:26,041
We would all decorate
the Christmas tree together.

489
00:52:27,333 --> 00:52:30,583
And I still remember that dad
would get a lot of presents for us.

490
00:52:36,041 --> 00:52:39,333
Dad dressed in his suit, mom in her dress.

491
00:52:40,416 --> 00:52:43,916
Together we would dance
all night on old Hindi songs.

492
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:51,166
I guess...

493
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:54,666
...that was peace for me.

494
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,041
-Come on.
-Where?

495
00:53:09,583 --> 00:53:11,833
-Just come.
-But where?

496
00:53:24,625 --> 00:53:27,041
Advait, what are you doing?

497
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:28,750
This is someone else's house.

498
00:53:33,375 --> 00:53:34,916
Life means choices.

499
00:53:38,166 --> 00:53:39,458
In or out?

500
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:58,666
Scared you.

501
00:54:45,208 --> 00:54:46,875
Old Hindi music.

502
00:54:47,791 --> 00:54:49,666
I searched the entire basement for it.

503
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:39,500
We searched for all the cases
in the police records

504
00:55:39,583 --> 00:55:42,041
that were solved by
Victor Ferns and Nitin Salgaokar.

505
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,041
There's another officer on their team.

506
00:55:44,166 --> 00:55:45,500
ASP Deven Shivaji Jadhav.

507
00:55:45,666 --> 00:55:48,083
As you instructed,
we also looked for those cases

508
00:55:48,333 --> 00:55:50,958
which were solved on 24th December
by this team.

509
00:55:51,375 --> 00:55:53,166
But we came across only one such case.

510
00:55:53,291 --> 00:55:54,416
On Narcotics,

511
00:55:54,541 --> 00:55:56,875
where this guy was sent
to prison for five years.

512
00:55:56,958 --> 00:55:58,375
-Advait Thakur.
-Wait.

513
00:55:58,666 --> 00:55:59,750
-He was a drug peddler.
-Move the barricade...

514
00:55:59,875 --> 00:56:02,166
-And was released yesterday.
-Let them in.

515
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:03,166
Who is he?

516
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:05,458
Jessabelle aka Jesse.
She is a foreigner.

517
00:56:09,083 --> 00:56:10,500
-Media.
-Mrs. Salgaokar...

518
00:56:11,416 --> 00:56:14,333
We searched her home,
but found nothing.

519
00:56:14,833 --> 00:56:17,375
Send both these pictures
to every police station.

520
00:56:17,458 --> 00:56:18,583
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

521
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:19,708
-Yes.
-And keep updating me.

522
00:56:21,291 --> 00:56:23,416
Put it down. Don't take pictures.

523
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,458
-Don't take pictures.
-We are from the Press.

524
00:56:26,083 --> 00:56:28,708
So what? Remove the camera.
Take his camera.

525
00:56:29,666 --> 00:56:31,125
What is this?

526
00:56:31,458 --> 00:56:33,166
Just because you are a cop
you try to bully people.

527
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:34,791
If you are a real man
then prove it to your wife.

528
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:36,541
Return my camera.

529
00:56:37,833 --> 00:56:39,666
Return my camera.

530
00:56:41,833 --> 00:56:44,000
Now take pictures.
Now take pictures.

531
00:56:44,208 --> 00:56:45,041
Get up.

532
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:47,541
-Michael!
-Leave him, sir.

533
00:56:47,625 --> 00:56:48,500
Michael!

534
00:56:48,583 --> 00:56:50,625
Now take pictures.

535
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:52,875
Cool down.
I said cool down.

536
00:56:56,375 --> 00:56:58,625
-Pandey, get them out of here.
-Yes, sir.

537
00:56:58,708 --> 00:57:00,500
Move back.

538
00:57:00,916 --> 00:57:03,458
These journalists also are watching
too much <i>Savdhaan India</i> these days.

539
00:57:24,875 --> 00:57:26,083
You go home.

540
00:57:27,666 --> 00:57:28,708
I'll handle this.

541
00:57:33,416 --> 00:57:34,666
I said, go home.

542
00:57:35,083 --> 00:57:36,666
I'll handle this. Trust me.

543
00:57:37,041 --> 00:57:39,458
Go, Michael, go home.
I said I'll handle it.

544
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:42,916
We have a piece of information.

545
00:57:43,541 --> 00:57:46,166
ASP Jadhav always goes to Fatorda Stadium
every Christmas to watch the match.

546
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,083
<i>Paint yourself in</i>

<i>Chant "Hu"!</i>

557
00:59:07,958 --> 00:59:09,125
Where do you think you're going?

558
00:59:11,583 --> 00:59:12,708
Did you really think

559
00:59:12,791 --> 00:59:15,833
that you'll come out of prison
and kill us all in one day?

560
00:59:33,125 --> 00:59:34,708
Guys...

561
00:59:35,458 --> 00:59:37,083
He's scared now.

567

01:00:30,916 --> 01:00:34,833
<i>When your heart</i>

<i>Even the hot summer</i>

<i>Be a crazy vagrant</i>

572
01:00:53,291 --> 01:00:54,250
Don't let go.

573
01:00:54,333 --> 01:00:59,750
Don't let go. Don't let go.

574
01:01:12,583 --> 01:01:17,833

575
01:01:17,916 --> 01:01:22,875

01:03:22,916 --> 01:03:24,875
<i>Arrest anyone with a red hoodie.</i>

586
01:03:24,958 --> 01:03:29,833
<i>Just a little longer</i>

587
01:03:30,708 --> 01:03:32,833

<i>Shubu, Shubu, Shubu, Shubu</i>

598
01:05:06,583 --> 01:05:09,916
<i>Shubu</i>

599
01:05:10,666 --> 01:05:14,250
The song is over... and so is the night.

600
01:06:11,083 --> 01:06:13,625
This night won't get over so soon, sir.

601
01:06:21,833 --> 01:06:24,000
There's a lot left to happen yet.

602
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:37,666
He won't spare anyone.

603
01:06:39,375 --> 01:06:40,333
No one!

604
01:07:13,625 --> 01:07:14,666
Careful.

605
01:07:16,750 --> 01:07:18,375
-I'll check on that side.
-You look there.

606
01:07:23,916 --> 01:07:25,125
-Pandey.
-<i>Yes, sir.</i>

607
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:27,208
I am texting you an address, get the
forensics team down here immediately.

608
01:07:27,375 --> 01:07:30,666
-I found evidence here but it's burning.
-<i>But Advait Thakur has been arrested.</i>

609
01:07:43,208 --> 01:07:44,041
See...

610
01:07:44,791 --> 01:07:46,000
See, sir.

611
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:49,833
Even after getting arrested,
he's showing attitude.

612
01:07:52,583 --> 01:07:56,416
He wasn't arrested, Borkar,
he surrendered.

613
01:07:57,666 --> 01:07:58,833
Surrender?

614
01:07:59,833 --> 01:08:01,583
I can't recollect...

615
01:08:03,375 --> 01:08:05,333
But I've seen him somewhere before.

616
01:08:44,583 --> 01:08:47,125
Dad, would you have let me go
if I had told you?

617
01:08:47,458 --> 01:08:48,916
No, right?
So I didn't tell you.

618
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,958
-<i>Vaani, I am your father.</i>
-Vaani, let's go...

619
01:08:51,041 --> 01:08:53,458
<i>Don't you have any protocol</i>
<i>or respect left for your father?</i>

620
01:08:53,541 --> 01:08:55,500
I am not Uncle Borkar.

621
01:08:55,583 --> 01:08:57,666
Save your protocol lectures for him.
And why can't I party?

622
01:08:57,916 --> 01:08:59,708
Because you don't even
have a driving license yet.

623
01:08:59,791 --> 01:09:01,791
18 is legal.
Before that everything is illegal.

624
01:09:01,875 --> 01:09:04,000
<i>I am sure someone</i>
<i>like you made this rule.</i>

625
01:09:04,083 --> 01:09:05,708
If it's a rule, you got to follow it.

626
01:09:05,791 --> 01:09:07,166
<i>I am not like you.</i>

627
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:09,916
I'll be home by 10.
I'll come on my own, so don't call back.

628
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,041
Where are you right now?

629
01:09:11,625 --> 01:09:13,125
Do you think I am an idiot, Dad?

630
01:09:13,208 --> 01:09:15,416
-Fine, listen...
<i>-No, you listen to me.</i>

631
01:09:29,291 --> 01:09:30,625
I said too much.

632
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:33,291
But you are also such a spoilsport.

633
01:09:35,250 --> 01:09:36,416
Sir, I had told you...

634
01:09:36,833 --> 01:09:39,041
You should've taught Nigel a lesson.

635
01:09:39,125 --> 01:09:40,750
Broken a few bones before letting him go.

636
01:09:40,833 --> 01:09:45,500
And I told you to follow the rules,
follow procedure, follow the law.

637
01:09:45,583 --> 01:09:46,875
What's the point, sir?

638
01:09:47,083 --> 01:09:50,083
He got out of prison after six months
and is peddling drugs again.

639
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:53,208
We'll put him behind bars again,
make a case and arrest him.

640
01:09:55,708 --> 01:09:57,708
-Where is Nigel?
-Waves.

641
01:09:58,791 --> 01:09:59,625
Let's go.

642
01:10:00,250 --> 01:10:01,708
This is fresh stuff.

643
01:10:01,791 --> 01:10:04,625
First you finish this.
I will give you 10 more.

644
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:12,666
What happened?

645
01:11:03,625 --> 01:11:05,250
Nigel, police. The police are here.

646
01:11:07,916 --> 01:11:10,625
-Hey, move.
-Advait.

647
01:11:11,708 --> 01:11:13,583
-I will kill her.
-No one panic.

648
01:11:13,666 --> 01:11:16,583
-Put your gun down.
-Guns down.

649
01:11:18,333 --> 01:11:19,916
-Leave the girl.
-Put your gun down or I will kill her.

650
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,125
He's come to take me back to jail.

651
01:11:22,208 --> 01:11:23,333
Put your gun down.

652
01:11:23,416 --> 01:11:24,541
-Borkar, don't fire.
-I will kill her.

653
01:11:24,625 --> 01:11:25,625
I don't want to go to prison.

654
01:11:25,708 --> 01:11:27,166
Listen...

655
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:28,833
-I will kill her.
-Please help me.

656
01:11:29,833 --> 01:11:31,583
-Put your gun down.
-I will kill you.

657
01:11:31,666 --> 01:11:33,250
Let her go.

658
01:11:46,958 --> 01:11:48,041
Let me check, sir.

659
01:11:48,125 --> 01:11:50,875
Come on, put the body in the ambulance.

660
01:11:55,791 --> 01:11:58,541
-Dad...
-Vaani.

661
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:19,125
Vaani.

662
01:12:23,208 --> 01:12:24,458
Vaani, wake up.

663
01:12:25,833 --> 01:12:28,416
Your dad's here.
Open your eyes, dear.

664
01:12:32,708 --> 01:12:35,166
Please, open your eyes.

665
01:12:54,916 --> 01:12:57,083
<i>You listen to me, I have a life.</i>

666
01:12:57,166 --> 01:12:59,083
<i>Dad, sorry. I said too much.</i>

667
01:12:59,166 --> 01:13:00,666
<i>But you are also such a spoilsport.</i>

668
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:02,458
<i>Your dad's here.</i>
<i>Wake up, dear.</i>

669
01:13:30,291 --> 01:13:31,791
I was so stupid.

670
01:13:33,375 --> 01:13:34,583
I thought...

671
01:13:35,958 --> 01:13:38,291
Mom and dad never lived their lives.

672
01:13:42,083 --> 01:13:44,875
Never bothered to ask them why.

673
01:13:47,833 --> 01:13:49,500
So that I could live mine.

674
01:14:44,333 --> 01:14:50,000
<i>This time when I leave</i>
<i>I'll never return</i>

675
01:14:51,125 --> 01:14:57,000
<i>You can forget me</i>
<i>And I'll forget you too</i>

676
01:15:01,875 --> 01:15:07,958
<i>This time when I leave</i>
<i>I'll never return</i>

677
01:15:08,541 --> 01:15:14,000
<i>You can forget me</i>
<i>And I'll forget you too</i>

678
01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:19,958
<i>This is my final goodbye</i>

679
01:15:20,166 --> 01:15:24,916
<i>And pray to God</i>

680
01:15:25,541 --> 01:15:31,083
<i>That may we never meet again</i>

681
01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:36,791
<i>May we never meet again</i>

682
01:15:37,041 --> 01:15:42,250
<i>May we never meet again</i>

683
01:15:43,250 --> 01:15:48,208
<i>May we never meet again</i>

684
01:16:21,541 --> 01:16:27,125
<i>I fear that we'll come too close</i>

685
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:32,875
<i>And my sorrows might alleviate</i>

686
01:16:33,458 --> 01:16:38,750
<i>I hope we don't become friends</i>

687
01:16:39,250 --> 01:16:44,583
<i>And my life doesn't</i>
<i>Become peaceful</i>

688
01:16:45,041 --> 01:16:50,458
<i>It's best that you</i>
<i>Don't complete me</i>

689
01:16:51,083 --> 01:16:55,958
<i>You're the sky and I am the earth</i>

690
01:16:56,208 --> 01:17:01,666
<i>May we never meet again</i>

691
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:07,333
<i>May we never meet again</i>

692

<i>May we never meet again</i>

694
01:17:19,625 --> 01:17:23,000
<i>May we never meet again</i>

695
01:17:58,166 --> 01:18:03,750
<i>I didn't realize</i>
<i>That we separated</i>

696
01:18:03,833 --> 01:18:09,458
<i>Tears trickle down</i>
<i>Even as I smile</i>

697
01:18:09,875 --> 01:18:15,458
<i>Why did I choose to fall in love?</i>

698
01:18:15,708 --> 01:18:21,166
<i>Everything that happened</i>
<i>Was my madness</i>

699
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:27,125
<i>I never want to return to your lane</i>

700
01:18:27,541 --> 01:18:32,666
<i>Don't want to miss you ever again</i>

701
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:38,000
<i>May we never meet again</i>

702
01:18:38,541 --> 01:18:44,166
<i>May we never meet again</i>

703
01:18:44,250 --> 01:18:48,958
<i>May we never meet again</i>

<i>May we never meet again</i>

706
01:19:06,583 --> 01:19:07,750
Give me four beers.

707
01:19:07,916 --> 01:19:09,250
-HPDTC brands.
-Okay.

708
01:19:09,375 --> 01:19:12,458
-Fine, make that six. Give me six beers.
-Yes, sir.

709
01:19:12,541 --> 01:19:14,333
-You take credit card, don't you?
-No, sir.

710
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:15,375
What are you saying?

711
01:19:15,458 --> 01:19:17,583
You own such a big shop.
How's that possible?

712
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:20,000
-How much?
-That's 560.

713
01:19:20,083 --> 01:19:20,958
Hey, drunkard!

714
01:19:31,791 --> 01:19:32,791
Hold this.

715
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:41,500
<i>Stop it, bro. I said sorry.</i>

716
01:19:41,583 --> 01:19:43,375
You're not doing me a favor.

717
01:19:44,083 --> 01:19:45,708
Thankfully I don't keep a count.

718
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,458
Otherwise you would have to
apologize for the rest of your life.

719
01:19:49,791 --> 01:19:50,916
Why didn't you come for my wedding?

720
01:19:52,416 --> 01:19:54,416
You invited my parents.

721
01:19:55,375 --> 01:19:56,541
Why did you need me?

722
01:19:57,125 --> 01:20:00,125
They've literally seen me grow up.
I invited them out of courtesy.

723
01:20:00,208 --> 01:20:01,708
And had no clue
they would actually show up.

724
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:03,375
Then why don't you
plan a reunion for them?

725
01:20:03,458 --> 01:20:04,833
Stop taunting me.

726
01:20:05,291 --> 01:20:06,833
Tell me something.

727
01:20:07,125 --> 01:20:09,500
Why do you run away
from every relationship?

728
01:20:09,833 --> 01:20:12,250
Bloody idiot, do you really think

729
01:20:12,416 --> 01:20:15,666
that every relation is going to shock you
as your parents when they separated?

730
01:20:15,791 --> 01:20:17,000
Everyone's a fraud.

731
01:20:19,916 --> 01:20:21,166
Do you ever speak to them?

732
01:20:25,666 --> 01:20:26,833
Lately it's been off.

733
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:28,583
You should call them more often.

734
01:20:29,083 --> 01:20:30,875
If the old man dies
before signing the will

735
01:20:30,958 --> 01:20:32,250
then you'll die a miser.

736
01:20:33,666 --> 01:20:34,916
Forget it.

737
01:20:36,916 --> 01:20:38,208
How's your married life?

738
01:20:40,666 --> 01:20:42,208
I'm losing my mind.

739
01:20:44,208 --> 01:20:45,041
What happened?

740
01:20:45,583 --> 01:20:49,208
Nothing. There's work at the office,
targets to meet, deadlines...

741
01:20:49,458 --> 01:20:51,708
Sometimes I can't make it home on time

742
01:20:51,791 --> 01:20:54,166
but madam insists that
we have dinner together.

743
01:20:54,666 --> 01:20:56,500
How do I do it? Should I quit my job?

744
01:20:56,583 --> 01:20:58,333
And if I don't, I feel guilty.

745
01:20:58,416 --> 01:21:00,750
Every month, I get blood tests done.

746
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:04,083
And if there's a small
spike in the readings

747
01:21:04,166 --> 01:21:06,375
then she puts me on
one of those smoothie diets.

748
01:21:06,458 --> 01:21:09,666
At times she faces problems herself
but keeps me away from every pain.

749
01:21:09,750 --> 01:21:11,833
This is like having
a mother all over again.

750
01:21:12,625 --> 01:21:15,333
I miss those hostel days. I swear.

751
01:21:15,416 --> 01:21:18,041
That was fun, such freedom.
No one to question.

752
01:21:18,125 --> 01:21:19,416
Towel lying on the bed.

753
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:21,916
Underwear hanging somewhere,
socks scattered.

754
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,416
That was great.

755
01:21:24,958 --> 01:21:27,166
I am afraid what's going
to happen when I have kids.

756
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:32,208
I guess life will just breeze through.
I'll grow old doing the same.

757
01:21:37,625 --> 01:21:38,541
Then leave her.

758
01:21:41,583 --> 01:21:43,791
I bought a three-bedroom apartment
on Carter Road.

759
01:21:47,416 --> 01:21:48,916
She made it home.

760
01:21:52,333 --> 01:21:53,833
I am really missing her, bro.

761
01:21:56,083 --> 01:21:57,083
Come on, bro.

762
01:22:30,416 --> 01:22:31,375
Leave me.

763
01:22:39,791 --> 01:22:41,541
He didn't come to our wedding.

764
01:22:42,625 --> 01:22:43,458
Yeah, always.

765
01:22:44,666 --> 01:22:46,125
He has always been like this.

766
01:22:55,333 --> 01:22:56,208
Where are you going?

767
01:22:57,666 --> 01:22:58,916
I am going home.

768
01:23:00,541 --> 01:23:05,458
<i>May we never meet again</i>

769
01:23:06,083 --> 01:23:11,000
<i>May we never meet again</i>

770
01:23:30,958 --> 01:23:33,625
<i>You still can't think beyond me.</i>

771
01:23:34,583 --> 01:23:36,333
<i>I know I mean the world to you.</i>

772
01:23:37,041 --> 01:23:39,083
<i>But I can't be that for you.</i>

773
01:23:42,791 --> 01:23:44,833
<i>Someday I'll have to leave.</i>

774
01:23:45,916 --> 01:23:47,500
<i>What will you do then?</i>

775
01:24:04,583 --> 01:24:07,375
Jesse? Jesse, I want to see Sara.

776
01:24:42,875 --> 01:24:44,750
Sir, we have no evidence.

777
01:24:45,166 --> 01:24:47,500
There was a power failure
in that section of the stadium.

778
01:24:50,416 --> 01:24:52,291
All the evidence has been corrupted.

779
01:24:52,666 --> 01:24:54,666
We didn't find anything
at Jesse's hideout.

780
01:24:57,416 --> 01:24:59,750
We've nothing to put
in the charge sheet either.

781
01:24:59,916 --> 01:25:02,916
In such case, the court can
grant us only two days of detention.

782
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:06,541
So all in all, we have nothing, sir.

783
01:25:07,750 --> 01:25:11,041
Long story short, Advait Thakur
will be free by tomorrow morning.

784
01:25:11,125 --> 01:25:12,250
We have only one chance, sir.

785
01:25:12,333 --> 01:25:13,708
Come on, speak up.

786
01:25:13,833 --> 01:25:16,875
If Advait Thakur confesses.

787
01:25:17,166 --> 01:25:19,083
There is no need for a confession.

788
01:25:23,166 --> 01:25:25,583
He killed three police officers.

789
01:25:26,208 --> 01:25:29,833
Shoot him, make it an encounter.
End of story.

790
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:33,416
Why are you in a hurry to kill him?

791
01:25:36,041 --> 01:25:39,250
Advait Thakur will pay for his crimes,
and he will also confess.

792
01:25:39,541 --> 01:25:42,333
-I'll get it.
-What confession?

793
01:25:45,583 --> 01:25:49,958
It takes years of planning
to commit a foolproof murder like this.

794
01:25:51,208 --> 01:25:55,333
And they don't plan so extensively
so that they can confess in the end.

795
01:25:58,458 --> 01:25:59,666
You're just wasting time.

796
01:26:29,333 --> 01:26:30,208
Why?

797
01:26:33,416 --> 01:26:34,291
Why?

798
01:26:37,333 --> 01:26:38,791
<i>It's Christmas, right?</i>

799
01:26:38,916 --> 01:26:40,708
<i>So I'm going to the carnival</i>
<i>with my wife and kid.</i>

800
01:26:40,875 --> 01:26:43,625
Bossy, come with me to Fatorda Stadium.

801
01:26:43,708 --> 01:26:45,666
We'll enjoy the match, drink some liquor.

802
01:26:45,750 --> 01:26:47,125
And watch the cheerleaders.

803
01:26:47,250 --> 01:26:48,208
Spare me.

804
01:26:48,291 --> 01:26:49,750
At least give it a try, Bossy.

805
01:26:49,833 --> 01:26:52,125
And anyway, you'll be
under curfew after a few days.

806
01:26:52,208 --> 01:26:56,208
-You're getting married.
-No, Jadhav, Teresa is not like that.

807
01:26:56,750 --> 01:26:59,041
You wouldn't know.
Are you married?

808
01:26:59,375 --> 01:27:01,875
Girlfriends are simple, but not a wife.

809
01:27:01,958 --> 01:27:03,291
You better understand that.

810
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:06,041
What the...

811
01:27:06,125 --> 01:27:07,916
Jadhav, what are you doing?

812
01:27:08,291 --> 01:27:09,583
Bro, say something.

813
01:27:10,333 --> 01:27:11,375
Bro, you too?

814
01:27:11,458 --> 01:27:14,166
-Bro, you're married.
-"Bro, you're married." Shh!

815
01:27:14,333 --> 01:27:16,125
I am married, not dead.

816
01:27:16,208 --> 01:27:18,791
A little window-shopping doesn't matter.

817
01:27:18,875 --> 01:27:22,416
Victor, have you done this kind
of window-shopping or not?

818
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:24,000
Or you're just wasting your
time at the gym.

819
01:27:24,083 --> 01:27:25,750
Church says that you can
only do this with your wife.

820
01:27:25,833 --> 01:27:26,666
Bro...

821
01:27:27,416 --> 01:27:28,916
Still a virgin, huh?

822
01:27:30,791 --> 01:27:32,666
By the way, I know a girl.

823
01:27:32,750 --> 01:27:34,958
100 per cent sex bomb.

824
01:27:35,041 --> 01:27:36,291
Exactly.

825
01:27:36,375 --> 01:27:37,750
-Villa 64.
-Jesse.

826
01:27:37,833 --> 01:27:38,750
Right.

827
01:27:38,833 --> 01:27:41,750
She will set you straight in one night.

828
01:27:41,833 --> 01:27:43,000
No thanks, guys.

829
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:45,750
But can you do it?
Do you want her address?

830
01:27:49,416 --> 01:27:50,750
We never pay.

831
01:27:53,125 --> 01:27:54,250
Listen, Victor.

832
01:27:54,333 --> 01:27:57,041
Visit her once, and you'll thank us later.

833
01:27:58,916 --> 01:28:00,375
You'll become a man, Victor.

834
01:28:00,958 --> 01:28:03,375
You should do net practice
before marriage, because...

835
01:28:03,458 --> 01:28:06,083
A happy wife means satisfied wife.

836
01:28:06,166 --> 01:28:08,291
If you can't make your wife happy

837
01:28:08,375 --> 01:28:10,375
she will run around
announcing to the world

838
01:28:10,458 --> 01:28:12,208
that Victor isn't a man.

839
01:28:12,291 --> 01:28:15,333
<i>That Victor isn't a man.</i>

840
01:28:24,166 --> 01:28:27,166
But they are all your
friends and relatives.

841
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:30,875
Yeah, but they are boring me
saying the same thing over and over.

842
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,250
Michael is so good looking,
Michael is so smart.

843
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:43,875
But actually, I feel great.

844
01:28:44,750 --> 01:28:49,000
I feel like the best guy in this world
is going to be my husband.

845
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,708
I always believed that

846
01:29:15,041 --> 01:29:16,166
we do this only after marriage.

847
01:29:17,333 --> 01:29:18,583
Call me old school, but...

848
01:29:19,333 --> 01:29:20,541
That was my plan.

849
01:29:26,833 --> 01:29:27,791
It's a good plan.

850
01:29:29,958 --> 01:29:31,416
But we're getting married in a week.

851
01:29:33,208 --> 01:29:34,958
So no more excuses after that, okay?

852
01:29:48,458 --> 01:29:51,083
<i>You should do net practice</i>
<i>before marriage, because...</i>

853
01:29:51,166 --> 01:29:53,416
<i>A happy wife means satisfied wife.</i>

854
01:29:56,791 --> 01:29:57,666
Yes, Bossy.

855
01:29:58,166 --> 01:29:59,916
That girl you were
talking about at the gym

856
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,083
give me her address.

857
01:30:01,166 --> 01:30:03,166
<i>Are you serious, Bossy?</i>

858
01:30:04,583 --> 01:30:08,000
<i>Villa 64, Lady of Eve Road. Antona.</i>

859
01:30:08,375 --> 01:30:10,416
<i>Her name is Jesse.</i>

860
01:30:12,666 --> 01:30:13,500
Jesse.

861
01:30:14,166 --> 01:30:17,041
I really hope
this won't be a problem for you.

862
01:30:17,458 --> 01:30:20,833
Since it's the holiday season,
I couldn't get a flight back home.

863
01:30:21,208 --> 01:30:24,375
And I couldn't stay at that lodge anymore.

864
01:30:27,083 --> 01:30:29,875
It's not easy to stay where
your memories dwell.

865
01:30:36,791 --> 01:30:39,500
Never ask a lonely person
why he's giving company.

866
01:30:41,625 --> 01:30:45,750
And sometimes you need an excuse to live.

867
01:30:46,458 --> 01:30:48,750
So you gave me that excuse.

868
01:30:51,208 --> 01:30:53,416
The chance to do something right.

869
01:32:45,416 --> 01:32:46,250
What is this?

870
01:32:47,208 --> 01:32:48,125
Do what you do.

871
01:32:49,833 --> 01:32:50,708
What do you mean?

872
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:57,041
I think you're getting me wrong.
I am not the one you think...

873
01:32:57,125 --> 01:32:58,416
Enough of the drama.

874
01:32:59,583 --> 01:33:01,041
If you want extra money,
then just ask for it.

875
01:33:03,416 --> 01:33:05,166
I know women like you.

876
01:33:06,833 --> 01:33:09,250
Now take your clothes off.
Do what you do.

877
01:33:10,208 --> 01:33:11,208
Take your money and leave.

878
01:33:13,708 --> 01:33:15,166
-I...
-Get out!

879
01:33:25,250 --> 01:33:27,416
They don't know how to respect women
but they call themselves men.

880
01:33:40,208 --> 01:33:41,416
What did you say?

881
01:33:43,916 --> 01:33:44,916
I am not a man?

882
01:33:45,625 --> 01:33:47,041
You'll teach me how to be a man?

883
01:33:48,041 --> 01:33:49,208
You'll teach me?

884
01:33:49,708 --> 01:33:51,250
Teach me. Get up.

885
01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:53,833
Make me a man. Teach me.

886
01:33:54,583 --> 01:33:57,041
Show me. What does a man do?

887
01:33:58,791 --> 01:34:00,416
What does a man do?

888
01:34:00,708 --> 01:34:01,750
What does a man do?

889
01:34:01,833 --> 01:34:02,875
What is a man?

890
01:34:03,416 --> 01:34:04,500
Make me a man!

891
01:34:04,958 --> 01:34:07,291
Make me a man!

892
01:34:08,125 --> 01:34:10,125
Come on...

893
01:34:10,375 --> 01:34:11,750
Come on!

894
01:34:12,333 --> 01:34:13,708
Make me a man!

895
01:34:23,958 --> 01:34:26,000
Michael, you are a man.

896
01:34:26,541 --> 01:34:27,583
You are a man.

897
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:33,375
So no more excuses after that, okay?

898
01:34:35,583 --> 01:34:38,125
No, no one knows.

899
01:34:38,708 --> 01:34:40,958
-No, no one knows.
-If you can't make your wife happy

900
01:34:41,041 --> 01:34:43,083
she will run around
announcing to the world

901
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:47,875
<i>that Victor isn't a man.</i>
<i>Victor isn't a man.</i>

902
01:34:48,250 --> 01:34:49,500
You are a man.

903
01:34:50,083 --> 01:34:51,125
You are a man, Michael.

904
01:34:51,208 --> 01:34:52,500
No one knows.

905
01:34:52,583 --> 01:34:54,583
I won't tell...

906
01:35:05,708 --> 01:35:09,958
I won't tell anyone.

907
01:35:10,541 --> 01:35:11,500
Tell what?

908
01:35:16,041 --> 01:35:17,541
You'll tell everyone
that Michael is not a man.

909
01:35:18,958 --> 01:35:19,875
Advait...

910
01:35:24,916 --> 01:35:25,958
What won't you tell them?

911
01:35:27,333 --> 01:35:28,541
That Michael couldn't do anything.

912
01:35:32,708 --> 01:35:33,708
Jesse.

913
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:37,916
Jesse, I want to meet Sara.

914
01:35:42,208 --> 01:35:43,958
Jesse, I want to meet Sara.

915
01:35:56,333 --> 01:35:58,625
Jesse. Jesse.

916
01:37:00,250 --> 01:37:01,250
I am telling you.

917
01:37:05,875 --> 01:37:08,875
<i>Police station case, Villa 64,</i>
<i>Lady of Eve Road, Antona.</i>

918
01:37:08,958 --> 01:37:10,875
Did you here, Jadhav? Villa 64.

919
01:37:15,416 --> 01:37:16,375
What happened?

920
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,083
What happened here?

921
01:37:25,333 --> 01:37:27,833
Don't know, sir.
This man barged right in.

922
01:37:28,333 --> 01:37:32,166
I wasn't here actually,
I was standing outside the door and...

923
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,166
-Do you know him?
-No, sir.

924
01:37:39,750 --> 01:37:40,916
Where are you from?

925
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:44,083
She is from abroad, I'm from Mumbai.
We're tourists.

926
01:37:44,166 --> 01:37:45,666
I see... tourists.

927
01:37:45,791 --> 01:37:46,875
Bro...

928
01:37:47,416 --> 01:37:48,541
There's been a problem.

929
01:37:54,125 --> 01:37:56,291
You guys will have to come with me
to the police station.

930
01:37:56,666 --> 01:37:57,916
To record your statement.

931
01:38:00,583 --> 01:38:01,625
Let's go.

932
01:38:33,416 --> 01:38:35,208
I've endured the pain
of shattered relations

933
01:38:35,291 --> 01:38:38,708
that's why I always stayed away from it.

934
01:38:44,333 --> 01:38:45,541
I thought

935
01:38:46,625 --> 01:38:49,250
it's better not to make new relations
rather than suffer.

936
01:40:01,875 --> 01:40:03,750
Come out. Come on.

937
01:40:04,208 --> 01:40:05,208
I said come out.

938
01:40:05,291 --> 01:40:06,625
-Trying to be a wise guy.
-Advait.

939
01:40:06,708 --> 01:40:08,083
-What happened, sir?
-Trying to be a wise guy?

940
01:40:08,166 --> 01:40:09,250
You want to complain...

941
01:40:09,333 --> 01:40:10,833
-I'll teach you a lesson now.
-Advait.

942
01:40:10,916 --> 01:40:12,708
-Where are you taking him? Advait.
-There won't be any complaint.

943
01:40:12,791 --> 01:40:13,625
Advait.

944
01:40:13,708 --> 01:40:15,375
-There won't be any complaint.
-Leave him.

945
01:40:15,791 --> 01:40:17,833
-Bloody tourists, get up...
-Advait.

946
01:40:17,916 --> 01:40:18,916
You want to make a complaint?

947
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:20,833
-Should I shoot him?
-What did you see?

948
01:40:20,916 --> 01:40:22,666
-What did you see?
-Sara.

949
01:40:22,833 --> 01:40:24,291
Now let's see you make a complaint.

950
01:40:24,375 --> 01:40:26,625
-You didn't see anyone.
-Make a complaint...

951
01:40:26,708 --> 01:40:28,291
You didn't see anyone here.

952
01:40:29,958 --> 01:40:31,083
Help me.

953
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:47,083
-Get up.
-Sara.

954
01:40:50,291 --> 01:40:53,083
Stay back. I said stay back.

955
01:40:59,541 --> 01:41:00,833
Sara...

956
01:41:09,750 --> 01:41:12,291
Bossy! You didn't have to come here.
Why did you?

957
01:41:12,791 --> 01:41:15,333
-What did she say?
-Nothing. She is scared.

958
01:41:15,750 --> 01:41:17,500
Bossy, you messed with the wrong girl.

959
01:41:17,958 --> 01:41:19,208
She is not Jesse.

960
01:41:19,291 --> 01:41:21,583
Bossy, there's some evidence in the van.

961
01:41:21,666 --> 01:41:23,666
Jadhav, quickly go get it.

962
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,541
Junkie's statement has no importance.

963
01:41:26,791 --> 01:41:28,250
We'll give her a small dose.

964
01:41:28,333 --> 01:41:30,791
After that, no one will believe them.

965
01:41:30,875 --> 01:41:33,875
Neither the press, police,
nor the court. No one.

966
01:41:38,333 --> 01:41:40,583
Bossy, it's a hard dose.

967
01:41:41,208 --> 01:41:42,250
Careful.

968
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:47,041
Bitch, you're the reason for this mess.

969
01:41:49,083 --> 01:41:50,166
Don't move.

970
01:41:55,666 --> 01:41:56,833
Victor, hold him.

971
01:41:57,500 --> 01:41:58,666
Sara.

972
01:41:59,500 --> 01:42:01,291
Victor, hit him.

973
01:42:10,708 --> 01:42:12,083
No, please...

974
01:42:16,583 --> 01:42:17,875
Please. No.

975
01:42:23,625 --> 01:42:28,250
<i>I want to spend all</i>

976
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:33,000
<i>My moments with you</i>

977
01:42:34,541 --> 01:42:38,750
<i>And make you look beautiful</i>

978
01:42:39,416 --> 01:42:42,541
<i>With my love</i>

979
01:42:42,625 --> 01:42:45,208
Bossy, easy. It's a hard dose.
She will die.

980
01:42:45,291 --> 01:42:49,958
<i>I want to tell you</i>

981
01:42:50,541 --> 01:42:54,875
<i>How much I love you</i>

982
01:42:56,500 --> 01:43:00,708
<i>With you</i>

983
01:43:00,791 --> 01:43:02,250
Sara!

984
01:43:02,333 --> 01:43:06,083
<i>Is where I belong</i>

985
01:43:17,583 --> 01:43:19,958
It's the villagers.
They are returning from Christmas mass.

986
01:43:20,041 --> 01:43:23,333
What are we going to do
when they get here?

987
01:43:23,750 --> 01:43:26,000
You know how to cover up a crime scene.

988
01:43:26,708 --> 01:43:27,708
Don't you?

989
01:43:33,666 --> 01:43:34,500
Sara.

990
01:43:34,583 --> 01:43:38,916
<i>I am tired</i>

991
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:43,750
<i>Let's go home, companion</i>

992
01:43:44,291 --> 01:43:49,291
<i>We'll never part</i>
<i>As long as we live</i>

993
01:43:49,375 --> 01:43:54,291
<i>Let's go home, companion</i>

994
01:43:54,875 --> 01:43:59,958
<i>I'll never stop loving you</i>

995
01:44:00,041 --> 01:44:05,166
<i>Let's go home, companion</i>

996
01:44:05,250 --> 01:44:08,000
<i>I'll be yours</i>

997
01:44:08,083 --> 01:44:08,916
Sara!

998
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:10,625
<i>And you be mine</i>

999
01:44:10,708 --> 01:44:15,625
<i>Let's go home, companion</i>

1000
01:44:58,208 --> 01:45:01,708
The court finds Advait Thakur
guilty under NDPS Act Article 47

1001
01:45:01,791 --> 01:45:05,125
for illegal possession and trade of drugs.

1002
01:45:05,208 --> 01:45:07,625
Sentenced to five years
of rigorous imprisonment.

1003
01:45:24,333 --> 01:45:28,958
<i>Every room smells</i>

1004
01:45:29,500 --> 01:45:33,333
<i>Of your fragrance</i>

1005
01:45:34,583 --> 01:45:39,458
<i>I don't need walls</i>

1006
01:45:39,541 --> 01:45:43,375
<i>All I need is you</i>

1007
01:45:43,458 --> 01:45:49,708
<i>With you</i>

1008
01:45:49,791 --> 01:45:55,375
<i>I want to build my world of love</i>

1009
01:45:56,916 --> 01:46:01,833
<i>Where there's just you and me</i>

1010
01:46:01,916 --> 01:46:07,000
<i>Let's go home, companion</i>

1011
01:46:07,208 --> 01:46:12,083
<i>I'll be yours, and you be mine</i>

1012
01:46:12,166 --> 01:46:17,000
<i>Let's go home, companion</i>

1013
01:46:25,833 --> 01:46:27,708
<i>I am a police officer for the world.</i>

1014
01:46:27,958 --> 01:46:29,791
<i>I make criminals confess.</i>

1015
01:46:30,583 --> 01:46:32,500
<i>But no one could've made me confess.</i>

1016
01:46:33,208 --> 01:46:34,041
<i>Listen.</i>

1017
01:46:34,666 --> 01:46:38,375
<i>My dad was an alcoholic</i>
<i>and he would beat my mom every day.</i>

1018
01:46:38,458 --> 01:46:40,291
<i>And I would have to bear</i>
<i>the brunt of their anger.</i>

1019
01:46:41,125 --> 01:46:44,041
Mom used to vent her frustration on me.

1020
01:46:44,125 --> 01:46:45,500
She would curse me.

1021
01:46:46,916 --> 01:46:47,958
Beat me.

1022
01:46:48,541 --> 01:46:51,250
Call men bloody.
Say all men are the same.

1023
01:46:51,833 --> 01:46:55,875
She scared me so much
that I was no longer a man.

1024
01:46:58,541 --> 01:47:00,833
Fear can reach beyond your imagination.

1025
01:47:01,208 --> 01:47:04,708
It can affect your heart, your mind

1026
01:47:05,583 --> 01:47:07,625
and even between your legs.

1027
01:47:12,958 --> 01:47:15,416
I would be scared, afraid...

1028
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:17,708
What if someone finds out?

1029
01:47:18,958 --> 01:47:20,958
People will laugh, make fun of me.

1030
01:47:21,625 --> 01:47:23,250
Then one day I had a calling.

1031
01:47:24,833 --> 01:47:26,291
Michael, enough.

1032
01:47:27,875 --> 01:47:28,916
We won't be scared anymore.

1033
01:47:30,125 --> 01:47:33,166
Now be what you couldn't be.

1034
01:47:33,500 --> 01:47:34,750
Be a man.

1035
01:47:35,833 --> 01:47:38,083
I finished police training
and became an officer.

1036
01:47:38,833 --> 01:47:41,291
Who would doubt a police officer?

1037
01:47:41,583 --> 01:47:42,875
Even got married.

1038
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,416
Simple Catholic girl.

1039
01:47:46,916 --> 01:47:49,208
And she thinks that
the problem is with her.

1040
01:47:49,291 --> 01:47:50,583
It's natural.

1041
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:54,291
Millions of women in this country
believe that the problem is with them.

1042
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:56,958
But I made one small mistake.

1043
01:47:59,666 --> 01:48:01,166
Sara found out.

1044
01:48:02,291 --> 01:48:04,375
She discovered my truth
in a single meeting.

1045
01:48:05,041 --> 01:48:07,458
She would've told the world about it

1046
01:48:08,333 --> 01:48:10,208
and it would've ruined my image.

1047
01:48:12,208 --> 01:48:13,291
So I had to kill her.

1048
01:48:14,583 --> 01:48:15,833
I was helpless.

1049
01:48:18,666 --> 01:48:19,958
I killed one more today.

1050
01:48:26,958 --> 01:48:30,708
<i>I don't know what is sex and how it feels.</i>

1051
01:48:31,541 --> 01:48:34,708
<i>But now I know how it feels.</i>

1052
01:48:35,500 --> 01:48:39,208
<i>I felt her warm breath against my palm.</i>

1053
01:48:39,833 --> 01:48:43,875
<i>I saw fear in her eyes,</i>
<i>her quivering body.</i>

1054
01:48:44,083 --> 01:48:45,833
<i>Trembling lips.</i>

1055
01:48:46,333 --> 01:48:48,458
<i>It was just me and her.</i>

1056
01:48:48,833 --> 01:48:50,041
<i>No one else.</i>

1057
01:48:52,041 --> 01:48:54,166
<i>And at that moment, I was a man.</i>

1058
01:49:01,541 --> 01:49:03,541
There were four witnesses to this case.

1059
01:49:04,333 --> 01:49:05,791
You've already killed three.

1060
01:49:06,166 --> 01:49:07,458
That leaves you.

1061
01:49:08,875 --> 01:49:10,541
Agashe is dying to kill you.

1062
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,750
Sign on this confession and go to prison.

1063
01:49:14,541 --> 01:49:15,916
At least you'll live.

1064
01:49:21,125 --> 01:49:22,291
You know...

1065
01:49:22,625 --> 01:49:27,291
You, me, Agashe, we're all alike.

1066
01:49:28,875 --> 01:49:29,958
All killers.

1067
01:49:30,541 --> 01:49:31,791
Just one difference.

1068
01:49:32,541 --> 01:49:35,041
You two don't enjoy killing anyone.

1069
01:49:35,625 --> 01:49:37,000
You don't get any satisfaction.

1070
01:49:37,916 --> 01:49:38,958
But me...

1071
01:49:49,541 --> 01:49:50,625
Sara and Jesse.

1072
01:49:52,791 --> 01:49:55,291
But Sara will be special to me.

1073
01:49:55,791 --> 01:49:57,375
She made me a man.

1074
01:50:06,708 --> 01:50:07,875
This is what I wanted.

1075
01:50:10,166 --> 01:50:11,916
Stay back...

1076
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:13,750
I'll shoot you.

1077
01:50:14,750 --> 01:50:16,375
Stay back.

1078
01:50:27,833 --> 01:50:29,916
Make him sit. Sit.

1079
01:50:42,833 --> 01:50:44,250
You were right, Agashe.

1080
01:50:46,750 --> 01:50:49,666
You will make him pay, not the system.

1081
01:50:54,583 --> 01:50:56,375
If you need any other help,
let me know.

1082
01:51:01,625 --> 01:51:03,125
Send all the officers home.

1083
01:51:08,958 --> 01:51:09,833
Where do you want to take him?

1084
01:51:11,166 --> 01:51:13,000
Whatever needs to be done, I will do it.

1085
01:51:18,375 --> 01:51:20,000
You're better as Michael.

1086
01:51:21,875 --> 01:51:22,791
Don't be another Agashe.

1087
01:51:26,333 --> 01:51:28,041
And as for Advait Thakur...

1088
01:51:29,666 --> 01:51:32,416
I'll make his death so painful

1089
01:51:34,041 --> 01:51:36,875
that he'll regret the moment
he thought of calling Agashe.

1090
01:51:40,750 --> 01:51:42,583
Go home.

1091
01:51:44,208 --> 01:51:46,625
Patch things up with your wife.

1092
01:51:55,583 --> 01:51:57,458
-Mr. Agashe.
-Yeah.

1093
01:52:22,583 --> 01:52:25,000
Hey handsome, your time's up.

1094
01:52:25,083 --> 01:52:26,833
Get in the van.

1095
01:52:36,375 --> 01:52:38,833
Let's go, let's go.

1096
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:40,375
Time to go home.

1097
01:52:40,541 --> 01:52:42,333
Enjoy your Christmas.

1098
01:52:42,750 --> 01:52:44,166
-Let's go, Keith.
-Yes, sir.

1099
01:52:44,250 --> 01:52:45,208
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

1100
01:52:45,291 --> 01:52:47,125
-<i>It's been so long since mom passed...</i>
-Come on.

1101
01:52:47,416 --> 01:52:50,083
-<i>And you still can't think beyond me.</i>
-Come, let's cut the cake.

1102
01:52:50,166 --> 01:52:52,166
<i>But I have to leave someday.</i>

1103
01:52:56,791 --> 01:52:58,500
Hey, move.

1104
01:53:00,500 --> 01:53:03,041
-Where do you think you're going?
-Put your gun down.

1105
01:53:03,125 --> 01:53:04,250
Tell him that...

1106
01:53:08,500 --> 01:53:10,916
Sir, everyone has left.
And he's in the van.

1107
01:53:13,958 --> 01:53:15,625
Borkar, how long have you been in Goa?

1108
01:53:16,166 --> 01:53:17,041
I was born here.

1109
01:53:17,750 --> 01:53:20,083
What is happy solitaire?

1110
01:53:20,541 --> 01:53:23,250
It's happy solstice, sir.
It's like saying merry Christmas.

1111
01:53:23,583 --> 01:53:27,041
Only a handful of Catholics say it.
Portuguese descendants.

1112
01:53:27,583 --> 01:53:29,583
-Like...
-Michael Rodrigues.

1113
01:53:29,708 --> 01:53:30,541
Correct, sir.

1114
01:53:58,083 --> 01:53:59,500
These are the house keys, Michael.

1115
01:54:07,791 --> 01:54:09,875
-There's someone in my life who...
-Charles.

1116
01:54:12,041 --> 01:54:13,208
I know.

1117
01:54:17,833 --> 01:54:20,250
Numerable phone calls
in the last six months.

1118
01:54:20,833 --> 01:54:22,625
More than 3000 messages.

1119
01:54:23,333 --> 01:54:25,208
And some dirty stuff on WhatsApp.

1120
01:54:29,958 --> 01:54:33,083
You've been going around with him
for six months behind my back.

1121
01:54:40,625 --> 01:54:42,583
You two have done it, haven't you?

1122
01:54:45,958 --> 01:54:47,416
He's coming to get you.

1123
01:54:54,041 --> 01:54:56,041
Why do you keep saying happy Solstice?

1124
01:55:00,625 --> 01:55:01,916
The right question.

1125
01:55:02,250 --> 01:55:05,458
Better hurry up.

1126
01:55:06,416 --> 01:55:08,791
If I start singing,
you won't get a chance.

1127
01:55:09,750 --> 01:55:11,500
There's a lot to say, sir

1128
01:55:12,750 --> 01:55:14,166
but you won't be able to hear it.

1129
01:55:23,416 --> 01:55:24,500
Michael.

1130
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,791
Hey, Charles.
Keep the bottle down. Calm down.

1131
01:55:33,125 --> 01:55:36,875
Look, we've sorted everything.

1132
01:55:43,750 --> 01:55:44,833
Right?

1133
01:55:51,083 --> 01:55:52,833
Michael, what...

1134
01:55:53,750 --> 01:55:54,833
Michael.

1135
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:57,583
Have you lost your mind, Charles?

1136
01:55:59,250 --> 01:56:00,416
Are you mad?

1137
01:56:03,333 --> 01:56:04,666
-Don't touch her.
-Michael.

1138
01:56:04,750 --> 01:56:05,875
Don't touch her.

1139
01:56:09,166 --> 01:56:11,000
-What did you do?
-Michael.

1140
01:56:11,750 --> 01:56:15,333
Look, if you think you can
get away after killing her,

1141
01:56:15,583 --> 01:56:16,416
you won't be spared.

1142
01:56:16,500 --> 01:56:19,041
-Michael.
-Remember. You won't be spared.

1143
01:56:20,416 --> 01:56:21,541
Michael.

1144
01:56:24,291 --> 01:56:25,833
That's what I'll have to tell the police.

1145
01:56:31,791 --> 01:56:33,708
Get down! Get down!

1146
01:56:34,291 --> 01:56:35,541
Move!

1147
01:56:36,083 --> 01:56:38,250
Five years ago,
you were arrested right here!

1148
01:56:39,583 --> 01:56:43,041
This is where your story started
and today, this is where it will end.

1149
01:56:43,750 --> 01:56:48,166
Are you the only one who can get a
license to kill after losing a dear one?

1150
01:56:49,250 --> 01:56:50,125
Not me?

1151
01:56:51,208 --> 01:56:52,416
Which dear one are you talking about?

1152
01:56:52,958 --> 01:56:54,166
That girl?

1153
01:56:54,708 --> 01:56:56,166
The one who was with you?

1154
01:56:56,916 --> 01:56:58,000
Family.

1155
01:56:59,958 --> 01:57:01,500
This is where

1156
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,166
the four of them
snatched my family from me.

1157
01:57:05,500 --> 01:57:06,375
Which four people?

1158
01:57:08,333 --> 01:57:09,458
Victor.

1159
01:57:10,333 --> 01:57:11,541
Salgaokar.

1160
01:57:12,750 --> 01:57:13,791
Jadhav.

1161
01:57:15,250 --> 01:57:16,166
And the fourth one?

1162
01:57:17,750 --> 01:57:19,083
Michael Rodriguez.

1163
01:57:21,500 --> 01:57:23,583
We'll have to tell something
to the others, right?

1164
01:57:24,083 --> 01:57:25,333
What will I tell your family?

1165
01:57:29,583 --> 01:57:32,666
-I won't tell anyone.
-She was going to leave me.

1166
01:57:32,958 --> 01:57:34,166
She lost her way.

1167
01:57:34,333 --> 01:57:35,541
She lost her way.

1168
01:57:36,500 --> 01:57:37,916
But she realized her mistake.

1169
01:57:38,625 --> 01:57:41,083
But Charles couldn't endure it.

1170
01:57:41,166 --> 01:57:42,708
He couldn't endure it.

1171
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:44,333
He killed her.

1172
01:57:44,625 --> 01:57:45,875
Killed her.

1173
01:57:48,250 --> 01:57:50,416
How dare you hit him?

1174
01:57:50,500 --> 01:57:52,250
Borkar, wait!

1175
01:57:52,333 --> 01:57:53,583
-Sir...
-Wait!

1176
01:57:56,583 --> 01:57:59,208
Why did you call me before every murder?
Why me?

1177
01:57:59,625 --> 01:58:01,250
Because I don't want to run.

1178
01:58:02,875 --> 01:58:03,833
I want justice.

1179
01:58:05,958 --> 01:58:10,250
And only a man who knows
the pain of losing someone close

1180
01:58:10,333 --> 01:58:13,041
can give me justice, not the system.

1181
01:58:20,375 --> 01:58:23,541
Sir, the villagers are coming.
Hurry up, do something.

1182
01:58:24,541 --> 01:58:26,708
If Michael is involved in your case

1183
01:58:28,208 --> 01:58:30,708
then why surrender before killing him?

1184
01:58:31,250 --> 01:58:32,583
Because...

1185
01:58:33,125 --> 01:58:35,541
if I wouldn't have been
inside the police station

1186
01:58:35,958 --> 01:58:38,500
then I could never get revenge.

1187
01:58:39,750 --> 01:58:41,625
Michael wouldn't have gone home.

1188
01:58:42,500 --> 01:58:43,791
<i>Look, Mr. Agashe.</i>

1189
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:46,875
When I made family my priority,
it fell apart.

1190
01:58:48,041 --> 01:58:49,208
He killed my wife.

1191
01:58:50,291 --> 01:58:54,000
He was about to kill me too.
So I had to kill him.

1192
01:59:12,500 --> 01:59:14,875
Sir, why are you wasting time?
Shoot him.

1193
01:59:15,750 --> 01:59:17,875
Who is going to kill Michael there,
if you're here?

1194
01:59:20,958 --> 01:59:24,625
<i>Waiting for him</i>

1195
01:59:26,416 --> 01:59:31,250
<i>To arrive tonight</i>

1196
02:00:59,708 --> 02:01:03,541
<i>Why should we listen to someone else</i>

1197
02:01:03,625 --> 02:01:07,500
<i>While we are praying?</i>

1198
02:01:10,041 --> 02:01:13,291
<i>Why is your heart filled</i>

1199
02:01:13,375 --> 02:01:17,833
<i>With pain and sorrow?</i>

1200
02:01:20,583 --> 02:01:23,375
<i>Who are you? What are you?</i>

1201
02:01:23,541 --> 02:01:29,416
<i>Think about it</i>

1202
02:01:36,208 --> 02:01:39,875
<i>Fight your own battle</i>

1203
02:01:41,708 --> 02:01:46,125
<i>Conquer one and all</i>

1204
02:01:46,500 --> 02:01:51,333
<i>Make your own small world</i>

1205
02:01:51,416 --> 02:01:57,000
<i>Become a crazy vagrant</i>

1206
02:01:59,416 --> 02:02:03,541
<i>Chant "Hu"</i>

1207
02:02:04,375 --> 02:02:09,250
<i>Chant "Hu"</i>

1208
02:02:09,625 --> 02:02:14,708
<i>Chant "Hu"</i>

1209
02:02:14,791 --> 02:02:19,625
<i>Chant "Hu"</i>

1210
02:02:56,583 --> 02:03:01,500
<i>Chant "Hu"</i>

1211
02:03:01,625 --> 02:03:06,458
<i>Chant "Hu"</i>

1212
02:03:06,708 --> 02:03:11,416
<i>Chant "Hu"</i>

1213
02:03:12,083 --> 02:03:16,875
<i>Chant "Hu"</i>

1214
02:03:16,958 --> 02:03:22,000
<i>Chant "Hu"</i>

1215
02:03:42,166 --> 02:03:43,250
Hello.

1216
02:03:44,583 --> 02:03:46,500
You're lying.

1217
02:03:47,958 --> 02:03:49,250
You're lying!

1218
02:03:49,541 --> 02:03:51,750
Someone killed Mr. Michael at his house.

1219
02:03:54,541 --> 02:03:55,708
Killer is someone else, sir.

1220
02:03:59,333 --> 02:04:00,750
The night's over now, sir.

1221
02:04:28,583 --> 02:04:30,291
Patil, get the ambulance out of here
before the press arrives.

1222
02:04:30,375 --> 02:04:32,291
It was some guy in a red hoodie.

1223
02:04:34,125 --> 02:04:36,083
I couldn't see his face.

1224
02:04:38,083 --> 02:04:42,541
Before I could realize,
I fell unconscious.

1225
02:04:45,583 --> 02:04:47,166
I didn't see anything.

1226
02:04:51,666 --> 02:04:53,041
What do we write in the file, sir?

1227
02:04:55,500 --> 02:04:59,750
No evidence, no witness, no statement.

1228
02:05:01,541 --> 02:05:02,750
Case closed.

1229
02:05:10,875 --> 02:05:15,375
<i>Standing by the window</i>

1230
02:05:15,875 --> 02:05:19,666
<i>Waiting for me to return</i>

1231
02:05:21,041 --> 02:05:26,125
<i>Every day, this is the sight</i>

1232
02:05:26,208 --> 02:05:29,750
<i>I want to see</i>

1233
02:05:29,833 --> 02:05:36,208
<i>I want to fall asleep</i>

1234
02:05:36,291 --> 02:05:42,041
<i>In your arms</i>

1235
02:05:43,250 --> 02:05:48,083
<i>We've been awake</i>
<i>For myriad nights</i>

1236
02:05:48,458 --> 02:05:53,541
<i>Let's go home, companion</i>

1237
02:05:53,625 --> 02:05:58,625
<i>We won't separate</i>
<i>Until the last breath</i>

1238
02:05:58,708 --> 02:06:04,416
<i>Let's go home, companion</i>

1239
02:06:40,750 --> 02:06:42,916
<i>Waiting for him to arrive tonight</i>

1240
02:06:44,125 --> 02:06:48,250
<i>Waiting...</i>

1241
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:54,791
<i>Just a little longer</i>

1242
02:06:54,916 --> 02:06:58,375
<i>Let him arrive, o restless one</i>

1243
02:06:58,458 --> 02:07:01,916
<i>You can shower all your love</i>

1244
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,250
<i>Shubu, Shubu, Shubu, Shubu</i>
<i>I don't know this, sir.</i>

1245
02:07:06,375 --> 02:07:07,791
How do you say this in English?

1246
02:07:08,916 --> 02:07:10,833
Wait a minute.
I'll give him the phone.

1247
02:07:10,916 --> 02:07:12,000
Please, let me go.

1248
02:07:12,083 --> 02:07:13,291
Let me go.

1249
02:07:13,375 --> 02:07:15,375
No, I didn't sell drugs.

1250
02:07:15,458 --> 02:07:17,083
-Sir.
-Forgive me.

1251
02:07:17,750 --> 02:07:18,708
Let me go.

1252
02:07:18,791 --> 02:07:19,625
Hello.

1253
02:07:19,750 --> 02:07:21,041
<i>I want to report a murder, sir.</i>

1254
02:07:24,208 --> 02:07:27,000
<i>Which I am about to do.</i>

1255
02:07:27,458 --> 02:07:30,708
<i>Vagrant, vagrant, vagrant</i>

1256
02:07:31,208 --> 02:07:33,958
<i>Vagrant, vagrant, vagrant</i>

1257
02:07:34,083 --> 02:07:37,458
<i>Vagrant, vagrant, vagrant</i>

1258
02:07:44,041 --> 02:07:47,541
<i>The caravan has set out</i>

1259
02:07:51,750 --> 02:07:55,500
<i>The caravan has set out</i>

1260
02:07:55,583 --> 02:07:59,166
<i>On this journey</i>

1261
02:08:01,583 --> 02:08:07,791
<i>No strings attached</i>
<i>No place to be</i>

1262
02:08:07,875 --> 02:08:09,375
<i>I am a...</i>

1263
02:08:11,583 --> 02:08:13,208
<i>I am a...</i>

1264
02:08:15,333 --> 02:08:18,958
<i>I am vagrant, vagrant, vagrant</i>

1265
02:08:19,041 --> 02:08:22,833
<i>I am vagrant, vagrant, vagrant</i>

1266
02:08:22,916 --> 02:08:26,833
<i>I am vagrant, vagrant, vagrant</i>

1267
02:08:27,500 --> 02:08:30,583
<i>Vagrant</i>

1268
02:08:40,041 --> 02:08:43,666
<i>Like an ascetic</i>

1269
02:08:43,750 --> 02:08:47,625
<i>My heart wanders around</i>

1270
02:08:47,875 --> 02:08:51,375
<i>Like an ascetic</i>

1271
02:08:51,458 --> 02:08:55,000
<i>My heart wanders around</i>

1272
02:08:55,458 --> 02:09:01,708
<i>Where will my fate take me next?</i>

1273
02:09:01,791 --> 02:09:05,458
<i>I am vagrant, vagrant, vagrant</i>

1274
02:09:05,541 --> 02:09:09,291
<i>I am vagrant, vagrant, vagrant</i>

1275
02:09:09,375 --> 02:09:13,208
<i>I am vagrant, vagrant, vagrant</i>

1276
02:09:13,916 --> 02:09:16,916
<i>Vagrant</i>

1277
02:09:30,458 --> 02:09:34,041
<i>There is a little bit of haze</i>

1278
02:09:34,250 --> 02:09:37,750
<i>The ambience is of silence</i>

1279
02:09:38,125 --> 02:09:41,833
<i>The ocean's dry</i>
<i>And I am still parched</i>

1280
02:09:42,083 --> 02:09:45,583
<i>Just unspoken words</i>

1281
02:09:45,708 --> 02:09:49,625
<i>Scattered like the grains of sand</i>

1282
02:09:49,708 --> 02:09:52,916
<i>On the surface</i>

1283
02:09:53,625 --> 02:09:57,166
<i>These scars on the moon</i>

1284
02:09:57,500 --> 02:09:59,916
<i>Can be cured by just you</i>

1285
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:05,375
<i>I am...</i>

1286
02:10:08,750 --> 02:10:11,375
<i>Vagrant, vagrant, vagrant</i>

1287
02:10:11,458 --> 02:10:15,083
<i>I am vagrant, vagrant, vagrant</i>

1288
02:10:15,250 --> 02:10:18,916
<i>I am vagrant, vagrant, vagrant</i>

1289
02:10:19,166 --> 02:10:23,000
<i>I am vagrant, vagrant, vagrant</i>

1290
02:10:23,708 --> 02:10:28,708
<i>Vagrant</i>
