1
00:03:43,938 --> 00:03:47,430
My name is Dharam Prakash

2
00:03:52,013 --> 00:03:55,278
You select any name but
l dont care

3
00:04:07,295 --> 00:04:10,321
l was waiting for this moment
since 4 years

4
00:04:14,001 --> 00:04:17,459
So many crimes are registered
under his name

5
00:04:45,099 --> 00:04:50,366
they think Prime minister Manmohan Singh
is the most dangerous things for country

6
00:04:51,005 --> 00:04:54,236
its spread in more than 200
districts of this country

7
00:05:11,592 --> 00:05:14,493
its spread in so many states
of this country

8
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:17,497
thousands of people have
taken weapons

9
00:05:17,999 --> 00:05:20,058
they are fighting against it

10
00:05:20,535 --> 00:05:27,907
they are getting weapons from
this country and from overseas

11
00:05:28,643 --> 00:05:34,138
there is no development here in 65 years
thats why there is so much crime here

12
00:05:35,016 --> 00:05:40,215
you are talking about vikas because
you want his land

13
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:56,994
until we use natural resources of this
land then how we can do development?

14
00:06:10,418 --> 00:06:19,122
as a chairman l want to guarantee you
civilians of nandi ghaat will get all requirements

15
00:06:29,203 --> 00:06:34,436
Mahanta group takes its responsibility
seriously

16
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:40,012
will there be seat available for
villagers in that university?

17
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:46,853
villagers dont want to leave that place,
will you force them to leave that place?

18
00:06:47,922 --> 00:06:53,326
when media is against development
then how truth will come infront of people?

19
00:07:08,276 --> 00:07:12,474
l dont understand 1 thing

20
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:34,533
l just want to ask some basic questions

21
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:43,003
before you waste my time l want to clear 1 thing,
now l do only 3 works

22
00:07:48,616 --> 00:07:53,110
you can ask anything about them

23
00:07:55,056 --> 00:07:59,993
else l will not give any answer

24
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:13,630
if you want to behave like this then its ok,
l have a record you killed 91 police and 150 civilians

25
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:32,691

00:08:35,396 --> 00:08:37,762

00:09:56,377 --> 00:09:59,210
he does not have anyone else
except me

35
00:10:01,982 --> 00:10:06,442
l was leaving in dreams.
l'm going back to government college

36
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:14,291
l dont want your father money

37
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:38,243
until now we have done everything
together

38
00:10:39,854 --> 00:10:44,257
stop drama and do sign on paper

39
00:10:44,892 --> 00:10:49,522

40
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:03,999

42
00:11:23,931 --> 00:11:30,097
l told him many times do his own work.

43
00:11:44,285 --> 00:11:46,810
l'm like this and l will
remain forever like this

44
00:11:47,488 --> 00:11:49,683
if you know about me then why
did you bring me here?

45
00:11:54,995 --> 00:11:56,895
dont show me your face again

46
00:12:06,307 --> 00:12:10,004
l dont know where he was

47
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:50,244
l was doing some boring jobs then
l joined 1 electronics company

48
00:12:51,051 --> 00:12:55,488
then l started my company to
make mobile phones

49
00:13:16,677 --> 00:13:22,172
1st consignment sold immediately

50
00:13:22,917 --> 00:13:28,981
after 2 months l got complaints
and dealers stopped my payment

51
00:13:39,266 --> 00:13:41,564
you beat police officer?

52
00:14:03,991 --> 00:14:05,515
how sure are you?

53
00:14:07,962 --> 00:14:10,692
they are planning for return attack

54
00:14:38,859 --> 00:14:42,090
rajan is here.
he is 400 degress far from target

55
00:14:50,104 --> 00:14:52,800
home minister is on the line

56
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,117
which group is behind it?

57
00:16:48,722 --> 00:16:52,658
we are doing investigation.
who is behind it?

58
00:17:09,977 --> 00:17:13,037
l announce infront of whole world

59
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:32,492
we will never give our land

60
00:17:41,074 --> 00:17:45,704
but sir home minister gave permission

61
00:17:49,383 --> 00:17:54,047
did l allow you to send officers?

62
00:17:59,026 --> 00:18:02,484
dont put your tension on me

63
00:18:05,232 --> 00:18:12,695
just now prashant mahanta has called
media

64
00:18:19,479 --> 00:18:25,850
until government takes the safety responsibility
of all workers we cannot do any work

65
00:18:38,398 --> 00:18:40,662
show some action DGP sir

66
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:53,507
emotions will be disturbed
by losing our soldiers

67
00:19:01,121 --> 00:19:05,581
l know adi but these politicians
have different compulsions

68
00:19:06,326 --> 00:19:10,422
they put pressure on us

69
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:26,736
timing is not good.
who wants to go nandi ghaat?

70
00:19:34,721 --> 00:19:38,657
l dont understand how 84 police
officer died in 1 night?

71
00:19:39,459 --> 00:19:43,327
and how terrorists are ruling
in nandi ghaat?

72
00:20:04,251 --> 00:20:06,515
you are going to do
this madness

73
00:20:07,354 --> 00:20:13,418
we got togetherjob after so much hard wor.
just now we decided to start a new life

74
00:21:07,781 --> 00:21:12,377
police officers come at their
own risk

75
00:21:25,399 --> 00:21:28,197
around 4 to 5 kms

76
00:22:31,298 --> 00:22:34,131
why gate is shut?

77
00:22:37,103 --> 00:22:41,472
key is with sir.
tell him SP sir has come

78
00:23:02,996 --> 00:23:06,591
another police station is 23 kms
far from this place

79
00:23:12,672 --> 00:23:17,473
when we make police station,
terrorists blast it with dynamite

80
00:23:19,012 --> 00:23:22,675
how you get all the information?

81
00:23:30,724 --> 00:23:33,989
they settle all the matters in
their own court

82
00:24:06,192 --> 00:24:09,821
stop this drama

83
00:24:24,311 --> 00:24:31,843
they make billions and when we ask
for 20 millions then they are angry

84
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:59,730
they buy weapons and arms
from this money

85
00:26:03,443 --> 00:26:08,745
l can arrest you

86
00:26:13,987 --> 00:26:17,514
sorry but even police dont reply
us for our protection

87
00:26:18,024 --> 00:26:21,323
millions lose.
what is the solution?

88
00:26:36,743 --> 00:26:39,007
but you also have to help us

89
00:26:46,853 --> 00:26:49,651
we have to fight together

90
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:52,950
our younsters dont understand politics

91
00:26:53,426 --> 00:26:57,419
they dont understand why we are
fighting with our own people?

92
00:26:58,765 --> 00:27:03,429
they think our politicians dont want
solution

93
00:27:05,505 --> 00:27:11,341
if our soldiers saved from terrorists
then they will die from malaria

94
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:19,444
they cannot talk to their family

95
00:27:22,088 --> 00:27:26,047
if he is strong then KK and saranjeet
would not be trapped

96
00:27:26,926 --> 00:27:31,386
they have full support of villagers

97
00:27:36,469 --> 00:27:41,463
they are among villagers thats why
its difficult to recognize them

98
00:27:42,242 --> 00:27:46,576
there network is so strong that
they get all our news

99
00:28:26,419 --> 00:28:31,015
they are afraid of police man
more than death

100
00:30:25,104 --> 00:30:26,696
your friend

101
00:30:27,407 --> 00:30:30,376
l accept we made a mistake

102
00:30:31,477 --> 00:30:35,174
government did not concentrate on you

103
00:30:35,782 --> 00:30:40,151
you are afraid of police man

104
00:30:41,988 --> 00:30:45,981
if you support us then we can
correct our mistake

105
00:30:46,993 --> 00:30:50,656
this country wants you to be
a part of it

106
00:30:56,369 --> 00:31:03,241
just think what they have done for you?

107
00:31:08,314 --> 00:31:12,774
did they give you all this?
can they give all this?

108
00:31:31,938 --> 00:31:35,897
this war should end

109
00:31:36,876 --> 00:31:42,610
leave this coward life and support us.
we can make a good society

110
00:31:51,724 --> 00:32:00,860
if you have any problem.

00:32:42,141 --> 00:32:44,974
they do buttering and then cheat you

114
00:32:51,951 --> 00:32:55,011
this is a police of cheat government

115
00:33:19,112 --> 00:33:21,137
from where all this money comes?

116
00:33:29,789 --> 00:33:37,389
they made a contract of
15000 crores

117
00:33:55,781 --> 00:33:58,875
they will open international
university

118
00:34:00,052 --> 00:34:04,853
where our children will speak
and learn english

119
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:14,857

01:01:23,361 --> 01:01:26,330
they have hired private soldiers

177
01:01:37,241 --> 01:01:42,736
we will give weapons training to
senate and congress

178
01:02:12,577 --> 01:02:15,375
l do collection and you do accounts

179
01:02:20,484 --> 01:02:23,681
whatever l do collection l
give it to you

180
01:02:43,507 --> 01:02:48,069
control yourself

181
01:03:09,233 --> 01:03:13,465
tell suppliers to give weapons on time

182
01:04:40,091 --> 01:04:42,355
why they are leaving us here?

183
01:05:58,469 --> 01:06:01,495
i'm a bit late.
i will be there in 15 mins

184
01:06:10,614 --> 01:06:17,850
every person has so many names here.
juhi is your real name?

185
01:06:40,778 --> 01:06:45,909
my father wanted me to study.
but something else was written in my destiny

186
01:06:52,923 --> 01:06:59,487
first he kidnapped my 2 brothers
and then he took over our land

187
01:07:17,314 --> 01:07:21,876
i want to make my government

188
01:07:24,088 --> 01:07:27,888
if i will live for 10 more years
then i will kill 100 more people

189
01:08:34,692 --> 01:08:38,594
i thought you are busy in singing

190
01:08:48,872 --> 01:08:52,706
after giving me location then
break your phone

191
01:10:24,068 --> 01:10:25,660
police raid this place

192
01:10:34,078 --> 01:10:37,172
everyone arrested

193
01:11:20,991 --> 01:11:24,188
they had a plan to distribute guns
to villagers

194
01:11:25,929 --> 01:11:29,956
but our intelligence is keeping
their eye on them

195
01:11:38,542 --> 01:11:43,536
no matter what adi do.
even death cannot shake us

196
01:11:47,918 --> 01:11:50,182
this is for civilians

197
01:11:55,426 --> 01:12:03,231
until we kill them all we will
not sit quiet

198
01:17:46,209 --> 01:17:51,374
we have smashed their trainign camp

199
01:17:52,215 --> 01:17:56,447
whole credit goes to adil khan

200
01:17:58,488 --> 01:18:06,088
are you sure 64 people killed are
not innocent?

201
01:18:10,167 --> 01:18:14,263
when police do human rights violent
then why there is no enquiry?

202
01:18:25,415 --> 01:18:28,111
these terrorists dont believe
on any rule

203
01:18:33,957 --> 01:18:37,654
police man died because they
were securing their country

204
01:19:01,785 --> 01:19:04,845
why you did not give warning?
why you did firing?

205
01:19:06,056 --> 01:19:09,685
we gave warning but they were
busy in singing

206
01:19:13,396 --> 01:19:18,698
it was no good. so many innocent
people died

207
01:19:21,671 --> 01:19:26,574
they think government never do anything
for them now they will take there home

208
01:19:30,413 --> 01:19:36,318
l trust you otherwise l would not
allow you to go inside

209
01:19:37,087 --> 01:19:44,323
you are getting confused from there
propaganda and if you want leave this mission

210
01:19:51,468 --> 01:19:53,527
l have taken this mission
to help you

211
01:20:02,979 --> 01:20:06,847
l know you are hurt by looking at them

212
01:20:13,356 --> 01:20:18,225
this place will become hell

213
01:20:22,599 --> 01:20:25,591
what we are doing,
people will get benefit from it

214
01:20:31,274 --> 01:20:34,539
when l get rajan,
you run from there

215
01:21:21,825 --> 01:21:26,558
you have done a solid work for us,
we should also do something for you

216
01:21:27,230 --> 01:21:32,031
we thought to send seeta mother to you

217
01:21:38,575 --> 01:21:41,339
we are sending riya memon as
a director here

218
01:21:43,246 --> 01:21:48,980
your president cannot stop
gold medal this time

219
01:22:28,591 --> 01:22:30,616
then country will move further

220
01:22:59,889 --> 01:23:02,653
whatever happened it was not
your mistake

221
01:23:37,660 --> 01:23:42,723
rajan is looking so weak

222
01:23:43,700 --> 01:23:48,194
you are also human being

223
01:24:01,384 --> 01:24:07,687
money is also a part of game

224
01:24:08,625 --> 01:24:15,292
and adil khan knows this better.
i have seen his record

225
01:24:17,467 --> 01:24:22,632
now you have to think how to
kill his confidence

226
01:24:31,247 --> 01:24:35,547
govind has 1 7 different cases registered
on his name

227
01:24:36,286 --> 01:24:43,988
why dont you transfer all cases to 1 place?

228
01:24:54,304 --> 01:24:57,296
thats why l dont want to leave you behind

229
01:24:58,007 --> 01:25:02,171
we have to accomplish this mission

230
01:25:02,946 --> 01:25:06,905
we will kill enemy by entering
in his own house

231
01:25:24,267 --> 01:25:27,725

244
01:31:11,547 --> 01:31:14,846

245
01:31:18,354 --> 01:31:20,914

on our project lands

248
01:31:41,777 --> 01:31:48,444
you need to talk to collector and
revenur department to empty this place

249
01:31:55,825 --> 01:32:03,755
we do work for legal work only

250
01:32:19,849 --> 01:32:24,684
they are arranging arms on
emergency basis

251
01:32:25,521 --> 01:32:31,949
people who got notice to empty the place,
we will go there and talk to them

252
01:32:33,496 --> 01:32:36,397

01:33:07,930 --> 01:33:12,697
we miss him

254
01:33:15,137 --> 01:33:23,408
but we have to move forward his work.
you have to take his responsibility

255
01:33:39,195 --> 01:33:41,459

256
01:33:46,969 --> 01:33:49,369
we have to empty 230 villages fast

257
01:33:51,006 --> 01:33:56,911
after supreme court orders
it does not work

258
01:34:02,885 --> 01:34:03,681
we love to talk directly

259
01:34:12,461 --> 01:34:17,364

260
01:34:20,002 --> 01:34:23,665

261
01:34:24,306 --> 01:34:27,537

263
01:36:59,261 --> 01:37:02,697
they were doing work with guns

264
01:37:09,371 --> 01:37:15,071
you look at terrorists,
they will look at villages

265
01:37:15,878 --> 01:37:21,839
they are angry on governement.
we will lose our newly made goodwill

266
01:37:25,354 --> 01:37:30,018

who breaks law

267
01:37:43,038 --> 01:37:48,169

supervise

268
01:38:12,434 --> 01:38:18,270
adil khan is doing with planning to
make us weak

269
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:22,637
we have to defend ourselves

270
01:38:23,512 --> 01:38:31,044
whatever we have, we have to
arrange food for them

271
01:38:38,327 --> 01:38:42,161

325
02:01:45,479 --> 02:01:48,277

326
02:03:07,261 --> 02:03:09,991

if he will not return then no
investor will return here

330
02:03:49,570 --> 02:03:54,030
nothing will happen to aditya if
you agree on our condition

331
02:04:06,687 --> 02:04:08,211
police will agree on it?

332
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:23,492

333
02:04:36,483 --> 02:04:39,680
government has decided to release rajan

334
02:05:19,627 --> 02:05:21,424
you will have all the responsibility

335
02:08:48,202 --> 02:08:50,136
what are you doing?

336
02:09:28,175 --> 02:09:33,636
is it true adil khan is your friend
and he sent you here?

337
02:09:42,890 --> 02:09:53,528
you are saying this monster is
a police officer?

338
02:10:04,912 --> 02:10:07,745
only 1 reason to show
this reality

339
02:10:11,785 --> 02:10:16,586
kabir was my best friend.
he will anything if he decided

340
02:10:29,770 --> 02:10:38,439
because of your act many soldiers
and innocent people died

341
02:10:41,915 --> 02:10:44,509
i did not know police will
fire on training camp

342
02:10:53,293 --> 02:10:54,590
we gave you place and
trusted you

343
02:10:56,263 --> 02:11:01,257
you cheated on us

344
02:11:08,909 --> 02:11:14,313
when i came to know who and your
problems l changed my decision

345
02:11:17,017 --> 02:11:21,852
thats why we gave this news to press
to break us

346
02:11:28,061 --> 02:11:32,464
we kidnapped his son and free rajan
thats why he is taking revenge

347
02:13:43,864 --> 02:13:46,560

348
02:14:28,008 --> 02:14:34,208

349
02:14:37,584 --> 02:14:41,111
you and rajan must be alive

350
02:14:41,855 --> 02:14:45,347
until you are alive thousands of
combats will born

351
02:18:36,289 --> 02:18:38,154
why you have done this?

352
02:18:39,426 --> 02:18:43,419
it was my mistake to allow
you to go inside

353
02:20:08,448 --> 02:20:13,715
i dont feel regret of it

354
02:20:23,963 --> 02:20:28,195
you did not understand me

355
02:20:55,395 --> 02:20:59,354
govind and rajan increased their force

356
02:21:00,533 --> 02:21:05,630
they are in more than 200 districts
of the country

357
02:21:06,639 --> 02:21:12,908
thousands of people are fighting
with their own people

358
02:21:19,686 --> 02:21:23,213
why we are not getting exit
of this problem?

359
02:21:24,157 --> 02:21:32,462
in 65 years of independence we got development,
but most of population left behind

360
02:21:33,533 --> 02:21:40,962
reality of india is that 25% population is rich
and 75% can earn Rs 20 per day
