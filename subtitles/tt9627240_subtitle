1
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:48,250
Take your medicines, I am leaving.

2
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,875
Salim, Namrata is here.

3
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,666
Hey, take your lunch box.

4
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:02,791
They're going to send me
to a college in Kolhapur.

5
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:06,083
Why don't you tell your dad
that you too want to go to Kolhapur?

6
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:07,666
What? Kolhapur?

7
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,166
Yes, Kolhapur.

8
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,541
Do you have any idea
how big those schools are?

9
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,625
Otherwise, you would end up alone here.

10
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,708
I will come with you.

11
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,750
Will your dad listen to you?

12
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:18,958
Yes, he will.

13
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:21,458
In those schools, you are
allowed to play games too.

14
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,166
Stop bluffing.

15
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:28,041
I am not bluffing, my cousin
lives there and she told me this.

16
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:30,666
You tell Dad, he listens to you.

17
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:44,166
I want a deep neck blouse
with three knots and this design.

18
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,041
The sleeves have to be short.

19
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,458
Make a leaf-shaped design on the neck

20
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,625
and I need this design on the sides.

21
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:54,250
This red blouse too should have
a deep neck

22
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,041
which should be around seven inches.

23
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,916
This needs to have three knots too.

24
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:01,583
And this one has to be stitched
only with a deeper neck.

25
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:03,833
Don't make any designs on this.

26
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,166
-Understood?
-Yes.

27
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,458
Namu, did you give medicines to Dad?

28
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:09,416
Yes, I did.

29
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,500
Give this to Sneha on your way to school.

30
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:15,708
There you go.

31
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:18,208
Let's go.

32
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:19,958
And did you inquire about the tuition?

33
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,458
No.

34
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:23,666
-Inquire about it while coming back.
-Okay.

35
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:55,958
Therefore,

36
00:08:56,375 --> 00:09:01,166
x2 - 4x - 1.

37
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:03,958
How much would that be?

38
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,083
You tell me.

39
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,208
Zero.

40
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:14,958
Note this down.

41
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,541
I'll ask you a question based on this.

42
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,333
Which river changes
its course during floods?

43
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,041
Check it in your textbooks.

44
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:31,000
Which river changes
its course during floods?

45
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,250
River Kosi.

46
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:38,375
In order to weaken the national movement,

47
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:43,083
the British Government
put the freedom fighters behind bars.

48
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,166
Have you noted it down?
Girls at the back?

49
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:53,125
Still the movement
did not lose its strength.

50
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:57,833
Finally, on 12 December 1911,

51
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:01,208
the king of United Kingdom, George V

52
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,166
annulled

53
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:09,000
the partition of Bengal
at the royal court in Delhi.

54
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,125
Komal, now shall we select girls?

55
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,708
Yes, I'll choose first.

56
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,375
-Pooja. Pooja.
-Select Pooja.

57
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,041
Okay, Pooja come to my team.

58
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,583
Ankita. Ankita.

59
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:28,958
We want Ankita to be in our team.

60
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:30,666
Then....

61
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,916
-Select Shruti.
-Shruti.

62
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,208
Shruti, come to my team.

63
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,791
But she does not know the songs.

64
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:35,708
All right. We don't want Shruti.

65
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:36,916
-Aishwarya!
-Come on.

66
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,416
Make up your mind.

67
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,000
It's decided. We want Aishwarya.

68
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,333
-We'll select Vaibhavi, right?
-Yes.

69
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:42,625
Vaibhavi is in my team.

70
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,458
-Next we will select...
-Select Sonali.

71
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,125
Okay. Sona, come to my team.

72
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:48,833
Kalyani will be in my team.

73
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,500
-Pratiksha.
-Prati, come to my team.

74
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,166
Don't let Prati go to her team.

75
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,000
-Prati, I won't talk to you.
-That's not fair.

76
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,000
-Let it be.
-Let it be.

77
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,041
Only these two are left.

78
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:07,250
-Let's select Vrinda.
-You sure about Vrinda, right?

79
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,833
We want Vrinda.

80
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:11,500
-Girls, Miss Kumbhar is here.
-Oh, my God, she's here.

81
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:51,625
Let's go.

82
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,875
Hey, walk faster!

83
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,625
When are you leaving?
Has your father left?

84
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,458
Were you hiding from me?

85
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,250
Do you know what happened today?

86
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,500
That was truly a wonderful experience.

87
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,625
We've caught the most poisonous snake.

88
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:54,541
But there are a few snakes

89
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:57,958
who, despite their diminutive size,
have strong venom.

90
00:14:58,041 --> 00:14:59,916
In reality, their poison...

91
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:17,000
Did her uncle inquire
about her admission in college?

92
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,333
Yes, he did.

93
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:21,125
He called yesterday.

94
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,333
The college and the hostel
are close to each other.

95
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:41,833
Even if the expense is a little high,

96
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:44,000
he suggested that we get her admitted
to that particular college.

97
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,333
That's not an issue.

98
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:47,791
Do you want some more curry?

99
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:48,791
No.

100
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,375
Namu, pass me the bowl of rice.

101
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,291
Namu.

102
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:31,875
Pass me the bowl of rice.

103
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,625
I am asking for the bowl of rice.

104
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:05,583
Get ready quickly
and don't step out of the house.

105
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:06,875
Yes.

106
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,333
Why don't you tell her?

107
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:09,458
Don't.

108
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,916
Tell her about the class.

109
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:17,125
No, I won't go to that class.
There are no girls in class.

110
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:18,541
So what?

111
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:19,541
No.

112
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:24,250
It's done.

113
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:26,666
Where are you going?

114
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:32,958
There was a tiger

115
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:36,666
and he had yellow stripes
all over his body.

116
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:39,958
His nails very long

117
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:42,750
and he started chasing us.

118
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:44,666
All right, let's go now.

119
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,333
Look there, a photo.

120
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:05,208
Sister, it's difficult to climb this slope.

121
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,541
I'll draw an exact picture of the tiger.

122
00:24:41,541 --> 00:24:42,958
Is this the place to draw pictures?

123
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:46,458
Do you know how old this place is?

124
00:24:48,541 --> 00:24:49,666
You, little artist.

125
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:54,791
Which school do you go to?

126
00:24:55,916 --> 00:24:56,833
Wipe it off.

127
00:26:15,458 --> 00:26:18,958
Good afternoon, sir.

128
00:26:19,666 --> 00:26:20,916
Please be seated.

129
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:58,625
I am your new teacher.

130
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:03,250
And I want to ask you a question.

131
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:09,541
What does the word language mean?

132
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:17,541
Does anyone know?

133
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,041
Let's have some fun. Let's play a game.

134
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,541
What is your name?

135
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:41,083
-Anuja.
-Anuja.

136
00:27:42,416 --> 00:27:44,166
What have you got in your lunch box?

137
00:27:44,291 --> 00:27:45,375
I've got roti and vegetables.

138
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:49,333
You've got roti and vegetables. Sit down.

139
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:57,750
What have you got?

140
00:27:58,541 --> 00:27:59,750
I've got poha.

141
00:28:00,666 --> 00:28:04,541
No, no. Nobody has bought anything special?

142
00:28:05,458 --> 00:28:06,458
Sir.

143
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:08,291
-Yes.
-She bought cake.

144
00:28:08,375 --> 00:28:09,666
Good. Get your lunch box.

145
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,083
No, let it be in the lunch box.
Let me have a look.

146
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,375
Wow!

147
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:29,958
Now,

148
00:28:31,708 --> 00:28:32,708
let's play.

149
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,500
What is it?

150
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:36,291
Let's assume...

151
00:28:38,291 --> 00:28:40,625
we are early humans.

152
00:28:41,708 --> 00:28:43,083
Who are they?

153
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:45,583
Early humans are species
who have not evolved.

154
00:28:45,708 --> 00:28:48,916
They were unaware of the world
and would survive on hunting.

155
00:28:50,708 --> 00:28:52,291
Suppose...

156
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:54,958
you are hungry.

157
00:28:57,208 --> 00:29:00,000
How will you ask me for this piece of cake

158
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:04,083
without using any language?

159
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,291
Who will answer this question?

160
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:14,750
Wow!

161
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:18,416
You tell me.

162
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:23,291
No, no, no.

163
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:27,458
She used sign language.

164
00:29:27,541 --> 00:29:31,416
She used gestures
to get her message across.

165
00:29:31,833 --> 00:29:34,291
But how did she know what gestures to use?

166
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:38,416
She surely knows some language
which is why she could enact it.

167
00:29:39,083 --> 00:29:41,916
Not like this. Let's think once again.

168
00:29:42,666 --> 00:29:43,875
Stand up.

169
00:29:46,458 --> 00:29:47,500
Come here.

170
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:54,291
Imagine that you've been hungry
for the past three days.

171
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:56,125
You are very hungry.

172
00:29:56,958 --> 00:29:59,500
I am holding this piece of cake.

173
00:30:01,791 --> 00:30:03,916
How will you take it from me?

174
00:30:11,791 --> 00:30:14,250
Had we not known language

175
00:30:14,458 --> 00:30:15,625
we'd have remained animals or apes.

176
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:17,958
Animals.

177
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,750
And what does language make us?

178
00:30:20,958 --> 00:30:23,041
-Humans.
-It makes us humans.

179
00:30:23,458 --> 00:30:24,750
That's why language is important.

180
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:33,083
Let's get introduced to each other.

181
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:34,958
What is your name?

182
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,541
Aishwarya Deshmane.

183
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,375
Preeti Badawe.

184
00:30:40,166 --> 00:30:41,375
Vrinda Metkar.

185
00:30:42,375 --> 00:30:43,416
Komal Bhile.

186
00:30:43,833 --> 00:30:44,875
Kirti Mane.

187
00:30:45,291 --> 00:30:46,416
Anuja Kulkarni.

188
00:30:46,916 --> 00:30:49,375
-She is coming this way.
-She's here.

189
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:51,875
-Avya, she is here.
-She's here.

190
00:30:51,958 --> 00:30:54,208
She's got a bodyguard with her.

191
00:30:59,041 --> 00:31:01,708
Oh! Look who's here.

192
00:31:01,791 --> 00:31:04,875
-Look there, Avya.
-Let's go to a disco!

193
00:31:04,958 --> 00:31:06,541
-Here comes the patient.
-Avya.

194
00:31:06,916 --> 00:31:10,041
Patient! Patient!

195
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:14,000
Shall I complain about them to my dad?

196
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:15,500
Keep quiet and keep walking.

197
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:18,291
Everyone in the family is scared of Dad.

198
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:20,166
Yes, I am aware of it. Keep walking.

199
00:31:20,875 --> 00:31:24,500
All of them will die if he punches them.

200
00:31:32,666 --> 00:31:34,250
Sister, please buy me a corncob.

201
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:35,291
Let's go.

202
00:31:37,125 --> 00:31:38,541
Or else you can have him.

203
00:31:39,833 --> 00:31:42,166
Look at my pigeon's eyes.

204
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:44,500
Look, how he's trying to fly.

205
00:31:45,291 --> 00:31:47,625
Look how brown his eyes are.

206
00:32:00,625 --> 00:32:02,583
Sister, I have a plan.

207
00:32:02,875 --> 00:32:04,625
Shall we take him to your house?

208
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,750
No.

209
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,666
Let's keep them in your cage.

210
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,875
No, they are fine here.

211
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:11,625
Let's go, we are late.

212
00:32:48,458 --> 00:32:49,583
Distribute it.

213
00:33:01,375 --> 00:33:02,708
Five.

214
00:33:08,625 --> 00:33:10,666
Namu, don't see my cards.

215
00:33:11,083 --> 00:33:12,916
Even you are looking at my cards.

216
00:33:13,583 --> 00:33:16,500
No, I haven't seen your cards.

217
00:33:17,791 --> 00:33:19,458
Nine.

218
00:33:28,916 --> 00:33:33,416
I got the queen.

219
00:33:40,125 --> 00:33:41,291
Eight.

220
00:33:41,916 --> 00:33:44,041
I don't want eight.

221
00:33:47,333 --> 00:33:50,833
Namu, go to bed now.
Get up early tomorrow and start studying.

222
00:33:51,458 --> 00:33:53,291
Dad, you too go to bed.

223
00:33:53,541 --> 00:33:56,208
-Did you take your medicines?
-Yes, I did.

224
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:02,666
Namu, you too go to bed now.

225
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:03,708
Yes.

226
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:14,333
-Grandpa.
-Yes.

227
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:17,041
I don't want to go to the city.

228
00:34:17,791 --> 00:34:18,833
Yes.

229
00:34:21,666 --> 00:34:22,666
Grandpa.

230
00:34:34,625 --> 00:34:37,916
Some people have been unhappy
for their lives.

231
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:41,416
The poet says, "Why do you
sit lonely at one place?

232
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:45,250
Get up. Why are you sitting aloof?

233
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,375
What purpose will it serve?
Get up and start moving."

234
00:34:47,791 --> 00:34:50,333
He says, "Hard work is our top priority."

235
00:34:50,458 --> 00:34:52,791
Man has achieved so much
through his hard work.

236
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:57,750
Animals don't go to school
like we do, do they?

237
00:34:58,416 --> 00:35:01,708
Only human beings go to school.
We've invented automobiles too.

238
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:03,500
Through his poem,
he is asking us to work hard.

239
00:35:03,875 --> 00:35:05,041
Sitting idle won't help.

240
00:35:05,125 --> 00:35:08,625
He says that people are working hard
and they are moving towards progress.

241
00:35:08,958 --> 00:35:10,041
Become successful.

242
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:16,291
He further says,
"Be determined and proud of yourself."

243
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,375
Don't listen to anyone
who looks down upon you.

244
00:35:19,708 --> 00:35:21,166
Don't be dependent on anyone.

245
00:35:21,458 --> 00:35:22,583
Rise up.

246
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:25,541
Don't be a part of the crowd...

247
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,291
This is a rat race.

248
00:35:28,875 --> 00:35:30,250
This happens with many of us.

249
00:35:30,541 --> 00:35:32,166
You will go through the same thing.

250
00:35:32,291 --> 00:35:34,083
People will ask you,
"What do you want to become?"

251
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:36,375
A lot of students say
that they will follow their friends

252
00:35:36,458 --> 00:35:37,958
and choose the same profession.

253
00:35:38,708 --> 00:35:41,375
That is not the right way.
We must decide for ourselves.

254
00:35:41,875 --> 00:35:45,375
So the writer says, "Be determined
and proud of yourself."

255
00:35:46,291 --> 00:35:48,833
Do not be a part of the crowd.

256
00:35:49,458 --> 00:35:53,375
Find out what's the best in you.

257
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:54,666
Right?

258
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:56,458
Everyone has some special quality in them.

259
00:35:57,041 --> 00:36:00,083
It is not wise
to always follow others, is it?

260
00:36:00,708 --> 00:36:05,625
For example, I like to take pictures
of butterflies. Photography is my hobby.

261
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,166
I have a camera.

262
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:11,041
One day I realized I liked clicking
pictures and I could do that well.

263
00:36:11,958 --> 00:36:15,000
That's my hobby. I pursue my hobby
in the free time that I get from work.

264
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:17,916
All of you must be liking
some or the other thing.

265
00:36:18,041 --> 00:36:19,083
What is your hobby?

266
00:36:20,875 --> 00:36:23,875
Do you like drawing?
You can master that art.

267
00:36:24,625 --> 00:36:25,625
What is your hobby?

268
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,666
Good morning, sir.

269
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:24,166
Please sit.

270
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:33,208
Before distributing the notebooks
I would like to read out an essay.

271
00:37:36,458 --> 00:37:40,000
A small paragraph of it
is beautifully written.

272
00:37:41,541 --> 00:37:42,583
Pay attention.

273
00:37:45,833 --> 00:37:48,791
"I slow down a bit

274
00:37:49,416 --> 00:37:50,958
When I see butterflies
Roaming around freely

275
00:37:51,833 --> 00:37:53,875
I imagine myself flying along with them

276
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,500
Butterfly means freedom

277
00:37:58,125 --> 00:38:02,166
Their wings are tiny
But they can fly anywhere

278
00:38:02,666 --> 00:38:07,250
They can sit on any flowers
Without a care in the world

279
00:38:08,875 --> 00:38:11,000
How colorful are they!

280
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,666
They have beautiful and colorful patterns
On their wings

281
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:18,500
It is so surprising to see butterflies
So diverse in forms and shapes

282
00:38:19,708 --> 00:38:23,166
Human beings are discriminated
On the basis of color

283
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:26,208
But butterflies are neither jealous
Nor biased towards each other

284
00:38:27,666 --> 00:38:30,416
It would've been so good
Had I been a butterfly

285
00:38:30,833 --> 00:38:32,250
It would've been so much fun"

286
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:34,458
Isn't it beautiful?

287
00:38:37,125 --> 00:38:38,458
This is written by Namrata.

288
00:38:50,791 --> 00:38:53,250
Shivani, please return these notebooks.

289
00:39:19,666 --> 00:39:21,416
Sister, please buy me some sweetmeats.

290
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:35,791
Aunt.

291
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:17,958
What is this?

292
00:40:20,666 --> 00:40:22,583
Your handwriting is different
on all the pages.

293
00:40:25,625 --> 00:40:27,250
Who has written this for you?

294
00:40:29,541 --> 00:40:31,833
I'm asking you something.
Who wrote this?

295
00:40:32,625 --> 00:40:34,333
I did it myself.

296
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:38,458
Why is your handwriting so different?

297
00:40:42,291 --> 00:40:44,958
Write something on this page.
Come on.

298
00:40:46,333 --> 00:40:48,000
Sir, I have written it myself.

299
00:40:48,833 --> 00:40:50,958
That's why I am asking you
to write on the same page.

300
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:54,375
I sprained my wrist, sir.

301
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:01,791
Do you think I can't
make out the difference?

302
00:41:02,291 --> 00:41:04,416
If you don't know something, ask around.

303
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,666
Ask Namrata.

304
00:41:06,041 --> 00:41:07,041
Ask me.

305
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:12,041
Namrata, if she asks you anything,
please guide her. All right?

306
00:41:13,333 --> 00:41:14,333
Take it.

307
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:16,625
This is not going to help you.

308
00:41:26,375 --> 00:41:28,708
Namey, come here.

309
00:41:31,375 --> 00:41:32,291
What happened?

310
00:41:32,375 --> 00:41:35,250
Show me your notebook.
I want to see what sir was talking about.

311
00:41:45,875 --> 00:41:47,250
It's very easy.

312
00:41:47,625 --> 00:41:49,583
You have to write it like this.

313
00:41:50,416 --> 00:41:53,750
Why don't you give me your notebook?
I'll return it later.

314
00:41:55,541 --> 00:41:56,916
I said I will return it later.

315
00:41:58,333 --> 00:42:00,083
What were we talking about?

316
00:42:01,041 --> 00:42:04,291
This is it. Sir is too much.

317
00:42:04,375 --> 00:42:05,958
Let's drop him there.

318
00:42:15,083 --> 00:42:15,916
Put him down.

319
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,791
-Here?
-Yes.

320
00:42:19,916 --> 00:42:20,833
Sit down.

321
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:23,916
What shall we call it?

322
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,541
Did you come up with a name?

323
00:42:26,166 --> 00:42:27,791
No, I haven't.
Why don't you think of a name?

324
00:42:28,208 --> 00:42:29,583
Shall we call him Tiger?

325
00:42:36,291 --> 00:42:37,583
Maintain silence.

326
00:42:38,125 --> 00:42:39,708
Come out in a queue.

327
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,250
What are those girls doing?

328
00:42:44,833 --> 00:42:46,708
Girls of class 7th A, please come out.

329
00:42:47,208 --> 00:42:49,541
Girls of class 9th A, please come out.

330
00:42:51,041 --> 00:42:52,875
Girls of class 9th A, please come out.

331
00:42:53,083 --> 00:42:55,000
Sit beside each other.

332
00:42:56,416 --> 00:42:58,375
Girls from class 10, please come out.

333
00:43:00,666 --> 00:43:01,500
Hurry up.

334
00:43:01,583 --> 00:43:03,291
Yes, sir, it's almost done.

335
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:09,583
Don't make noise. All of you sit quietly.

336
00:43:10,208 --> 00:43:11,791
Namrata Deshpande.

337
00:43:12,291 --> 00:43:17,500
Namrata Deshpande, come near
the stage quickly. Namrata Deshpande...

338
00:43:25,333 --> 00:43:29,541
Oh Lord, give us the strength

339
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,041
Where were you?

340
00:43:31,125 --> 00:43:34,291
-I was in the class itself.
-So that we don't lose faith in You

341
00:43:35,041 --> 00:43:39,291
Oh Lord! Give us the strength

342
00:43:39,625 --> 00:43:43,708
So that we don't lose faith in You

343
00:43:44,125 --> 00:43:47,625
We wish to walk on a wise path

344
00:43:48,416 --> 00:43:52,708
Do not let us make mistakes

345
00:44:09,666 --> 00:44:12,333
Grandpa, I've brought your medicines.

346
00:44:14,708 --> 00:44:16,166
I've got both the tablets.

347
00:44:29,791 --> 00:44:32,416
Grandpa, should I get some tea for you?

348
00:44:39,166 --> 00:44:40,333
Grandpa?

349
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:37,750
Sir, I have kept the notebooks, may I go?

350
00:46:38,583 --> 00:46:40,916
-Hasn't Namrata come to class yet?
-No.

351
00:46:41,625 --> 00:46:42,958
Where does she stay?

352
00:46:48,875 --> 00:46:50,541
Sir, have some tea.

353
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:52,916
Thank you.

354
00:47:01,708 --> 00:47:04,208
Namu enjoys reading.

355
00:47:05,208 --> 00:47:08,625
She studies on her own.
I don't even have to tell her.

356
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:11,833
Yes, she is a responsible kid.
I have seen it in the class.

357
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:15,458
I am planning on sending her to the city
for further studies.

358
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:18,375
-Her uncle stays there.
-I see.

359
00:47:20,375 --> 00:47:23,208
But I am worried about her future.

360
00:47:23,458 --> 00:47:25,666
Her future seems difficult.

361
00:47:26,541 --> 00:47:28,208
Nobody in the family has ever had it.

362
00:47:28,875 --> 00:47:32,125
I don't understand how she got it.

363
00:47:32,708 --> 00:47:36,416
Vitiligo is not a disease actually,
but people don't understand.

364
00:47:37,791 --> 00:47:40,416
Many diseases get dodged just because
they don't affect our appearance.

365
00:47:42,625 --> 00:47:43,583
But times have changed,

366
00:47:43,666 --> 00:47:45,875
physical appearance does not matter
as your actual being.

367
00:47:46,208 --> 00:47:48,208
You should concentrate more
on getting her educated.

368
00:47:48,291 --> 00:47:50,458
Yes. She is an introvert.

369
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:53,458
She has little social anxiety.

370
00:47:54,208 --> 00:47:56,000
Such people are intelligent.

371
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,375
Don't you worry.

372
00:48:00,208 --> 00:48:02,833
Send her to me,
I will take care of her studies.

373
00:48:03,375 --> 00:48:06,250
-I'll take extra classes after school.
-All right.

374
00:48:07,208 --> 00:48:08,166
Goodbye.

375
00:48:08,375 --> 00:48:10,375
-I'll send her to you on Monday.
-Okay.

376
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:34,208
The story is about a house.

377
00:48:34,583 --> 00:48:37,916
The writer talks about her old house.

378
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:40,833
Our old house.

379
00:48:41,375 --> 00:48:43,500
All of us like our houses.

380
00:48:43,625 --> 00:48:45,291
Many of us love our uncle's house.

381
00:48:45,875 --> 00:48:50,083
We like to steal groundnuts, peel them
and eat them secretly.

382
00:48:52,583 --> 00:48:55,750
Has anyone of you ever had a breakfast
in a city like Mumbai or Pune?

383
00:48:56,041 --> 00:48:57,125
We haven't.

384
00:49:00,416 --> 00:49:01,666
Villages are fun to live in.

385
00:49:02,541 --> 00:49:03,416
Aren't they?

386
00:49:05,125 --> 00:49:07,666
So, the next time you visit your village...

387
00:49:08,166 --> 00:49:10,541
Sir, please come and have lunch with us.

388
00:49:11,625 --> 00:49:12,958
I'll taste it.

389
00:49:23,666 --> 00:49:28,833
Words that combine two sentences
are called conjunctions.

390
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:34,791
The serial numbers 84 and 85 have to be
on the right side and in red ink, got it?

391
00:49:38,708 --> 00:49:41,791
One, two, three, four.

392
00:49:57,041 --> 00:50:00,041
Namu, you are late for your class.
Hurry up.

393
00:50:00,125 --> 00:50:01,083
Yes.

394
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:34,708
Be quick. Has everyone got an object?

395
00:50:35,083 --> 00:50:36,125
Come on.

396
00:50:37,708 --> 00:50:39,416
Let's go, Ashwini.

397
00:50:51,625 --> 00:50:53,208
Who will speak first?

398
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:56,541
Start.

399
00:51:39,083 --> 00:51:40,416
Good, isn't it?

400
00:51:43,375 --> 00:51:44,750
Who will speak next?

401
00:51:49,916 --> 00:51:51,041
Namrata, you.

402
00:51:52,708 --> 00:51:53,791
Will you speak?

403
00:51:54,958 --> 00:51:56,291
Sir, I'll speak tomorrow.

404
00:51:58,041 --> 00:51:59,916
Okay. All right.

405
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:09,708
Hey, Namrata, just wait for a minute.

406
00:52:21,208 --> 00:52:23,750
This is for you to read.
You like reading, don't you?

407
00:52:48,875 --> 00:52:49,791
Sir!

408
00:52:51,875 --> 00:52:53,250
Namrata.

409
00:52:55,541 --> 00:52:56,416
Hello.

410
00:52:58,458 --> 00:52:59,750
It seems you are late today.

411
00:53:02,958 --> 00:53:04,083
Do you study?

412
00:53:04,166 --> 00:53:05,250
Yes, I do.

413
00:53:05,333 --> 00:53:07,916
I have always seen you loitering around.

414
00:53:08,208 --> 00:53:10,291
-I don't.
-Keep walking.

415
00:53:24,875 --> 00:53:26,166
Hey, Salman.

416
00:53:43,208 --> 00:53:45,083
I studied in an ordinary school.

417
00:53:46,541 --> 00:53:48,750
I had a big group
when I was in tenth class.

418
00:53:52,458 --> 00:53:54,791
But I was also an introvert like you are.

419
00:53:55,208 --> 00:53:56,583
I had social anxiety too.

420
00:53:58,208 --> 00:53:59,375
I remember,

421
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,625
once a friend of mine...

422
00:54:03,916 --> 00:54:06,666
His name was Sumya.
He brought a shirt which had polka dots.

423
00:54:06,958 --> 00:54:09,416
It was considered fashionable
in those days.

424
00:54:11,666 --> 00:54:14,250
Following in his footsteps,
his friend got the same shirt.

425
00:54:15,583 --> 00:54:18,625
Eventually the whole class
bought the same kind of shirt.

426
00:54:21,333 --> 00:54:22,833
Then the boys forced me to buy one.

427
00:54:23,583 --> 00:54:27,083
They told me that I had no sense
of fashion and no girl would look at me.

428
00:54:27,208 --> 00:54:29,333
They asked me to buy a shirt
with polka dots.

429
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:32,583
On Saturdays we were exempted
from wearing school uniforms

430
00:54:32,666 --> 00:54:34,500
and then the boys used to tease me.

431
00:54:35,791 --> 00:54:37,375
I was done.

432
00:54:37,625 --> 00:54:39,625
I went home...

433
00:54:40,666 --> 00:54:42,333
and demanded for a shirt with polka dots.

434
00:54:44,041 --> 00:54:46,333
After buying the fashionable shirt,

435
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:47,791
I flaunted it to my neighbors.

436
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:52,166
My schooling was done.

437
00:54:52,666 --> 00:54:55,125
I started going to college
and wore the same shirt...

438
00:54:56,333 --> 00:54:57,375
with polka dots.

439
00:54:59,125 --> 00:55:00,875
After taking my 12th grade exams,

440
00:55:01,333 --> 00:55:04,250
I bumped into Sumya
when I came out of the class.

441
00:55:05,458 --> 00:55:08,250
Coincidentally, I was wearing
the same shirt that day.

442
00:55:10,166 --> 00:55:15,166
He couldn't stop laughing at me.

443
00:55:15,791 --> 00:55:17,583
He told me that I was fooled.

444
00:55:18,375 --> 00:55:19,416
I asked what happened.

445
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,708
He asked me who had worn the shirt first.

446
00:55:22,041 --> 00:55:22,875
I said, "You."

447
00:55:22,958 --> 00:55:26,458
He said, "You fool! Devya placed a bet
of rupees 50 with me

448
00:55:27,083 --> 00:55:29,875
that he would fool all boys
by making them wear this shirt.

449
00:55:30,541 --> 00:55:32,333
We used to go out in groups

450
00:55:32,416 --> 00:55:37,166
and ask boys
to buy shirts with polka dots."

451
00:55:37,958 --> 00:55:39,833
They used to say,
"You don't have a sense of fashion

452
00:55:39,916 --> 00:55:41,458
and girls don't look at such guys."

453
00:55:42,041 --> 00:55:44,166
I was disappointed.

454
00:55:44,458 --> 00:55:49,541
For years I was under the impression
that I looked cool but I became a joke.

455
00:55:52,125 --> 00:55:53,583
We all face this.

456
00:55:55,125 --> 00:55:57,833
Sumya was fooled too
because he brought a shirt

457
00:55:57,958 --> 00:56:00,375
worth 100 rupees for a bet of 50 rupees.

458
00:56:00,625 --> 00:56:01,625
Right?

459
00:56:02,333 --> 00:56:04,291
But who were the bigger fools?

460
00:56:04,833 --> 00:56:05,750
We were.

461
00:56:05,958 --> 00:56:08,250
Because we wanted to be like him.

462
00:56:10,125 --> 00:56:11,625
The world functions in a similar way.

463
00:56:12,208 --> 00:56:14,208
They wants us to become like them.

464
00:56:15,375 --> 00:56:17,416
We must learn to discover
our own individuality.

465
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:22,166
We must realize that we are beautiful
the way we are.

466
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:27,000
Tell me something.
Have you ever seen a sparrow, who is sad,

467
00:56:27,125 --> 00:56:30,750
envying a peacock because it has
beautiful feathers?

468
00:56:32,041 --> 00:56:34,666
Or have you seen a peacock who is sad

469
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:37,541
because he can't fly like a sparrow?

470
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,333
Both of them are happy, aren't they?

471
00:56:41,291 --> 00:56:42,250
Why?

472
00:56:42,625 --> 00:56:46,500
Because they know they are beautiful
the way they are.

473
00:56:48,416 --> 00:56:50,958
We must appreciate our inner beauty.

474
00:56:53,375 --> 00:56:54,500
Let's leave.

475
00:56:55,166 --> 00:56:56,083
Let's go.

476
00:58:21,458 --> 00:58:22,666
Come quickly.

477
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,666
Where does the author live? In Delhi.

478
00:58:33,208 --> 00:58:35,541
The weather is hot in Delhi. Am I right?

479
00:58:36,083 --> 00:58:40,083
His mother always stopped him
from going out to play.

480
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:43,375
Don't your mothers stop you
from playing out in the sun?

481
00:58:43,833 --> 00:58:45,000
The author's mother did the same.

482
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:46,583
Still he would go

483
00:58:47,208 --> 00:58:52,000
telling his mom that he would only play
under the black plum tree.

484
00:58:53,291 --> 00:58:54,541
His mom would allow him them.

485
00:58:54,875 --> 00:58:57,916
The author is now comparing
the black plum tree to his grandpa.

486
00:58:59,041 --> 00:59:02,666
The tree is like a grandfather
who would look after us.

487
00:59:03,625 --> 00:59:06,041
Do you have trees around your house?

488
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:07,458
-Yes, we have.
-Do you?

489
00:59:07,541 --> 00:59:08,375
Which trees are there?

490
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:09,791
-Mango tree.
-A mango tree.

491
00:59:10,333 --> 00:59:11,166
What about you?

492
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:12,750
-We have a jasmine tree.
-A jasmine tree.

493
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:15,583
-It's nice and fragrant.
-Yes.

494
00:59:15,666 --> 00:59:16,625
Jackfruit.

495
00:59:16,708 --> 00:59:18,458
Jackfruit. Which one? Soft or hard?

496
00:59:18,583 --> 00:59:19,833
Hard.

497
00:59:22,083 --> 00:59:23,375
Which tree do you like?

498
00:59:24,208 --> 00:59:26,750
I like casuarina tree.

499
00:59:27,291 --> 00:59:28,333
Why?

500
00:59:28,666 --> 00:59:31,333
I like the rustle of its leaves
when the wind blows.

501
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,750
Does anyone of you speak to trees?

502
00:59:35,958 --> 00:59:38,250
-Yes, we do.
-What do you say?

503
00:59:38,458 --> 00:59:39,791
We ask them, "How do you do?"

504
00:59:39,875 --> 00:59:41,166
Do you ask the trees
if they study at school?

505
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:42,666
-No.
-Then?

506
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:44,250
We share our secrets.

507
00:59:44,333 --> 00:59:46,208
-Do you share your secrets?
-Yes.

508
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:47,583
What are your secrets?

509
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:49,791
We cannot reveal them to you.

510
00:59:49,875 --> 00:59:51,250
Of course, they are called secrets
for a reason.

511
00:59:51,416 --> 00:59:54,750
Likewise, the author says
that he spoke to trees.

512
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:04,041
Say goodbye to the trees.

513
01:00:04,125 --> 01:00:05,291
Move fast

514
01:00:06,416 --> 01:00:08,541
To study trees means,

515
01:00:09,041 --> 01:00:12,333
to observe the trees of
various shapes and sizes.

516
01:04:33,666 --> 01:04:36,625
What was the age difference between
grandma and grandpa?

517
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:39,666
Around 20 years.

518
01:04:39,875 --> 01:04:40,958
Why do you ask?

519
01:04:42,958 --> 01:04:45,833
Then how did grandpa marry her?

520
01:04:46,875 --> 01:04:49,791
In older times, due to lack of education,

521
01:04:50,041 --> 01:04:51,666
girls were married off at an early age.

522
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:55,208
Your uncle himself
is 15 years older than your aunt.

523
01:04:57,250 --> 01:04:59,625
Parents used to start
thinking about their daughter's marriage

524
01:04:59,708 --> 01:05:01,875
once she attained puberty.

525
01:05:11,875 --> 01:05:15,041
It talks about the history of Buddhism
that dates back to 2500 years.

526
01:05:15,166 --> 01:05:18,125
I'm afraid the kids won't understand this.
It's too much for them.

527
01:05:18,208 --> 01:05:20,666
-But we can at least try.
-Of course.

528
01:05:24,875 --> 01:05:27,916
-Namrata, did you complete the chart?
-Sir.

529
01:05:28,083 --> 01:05:30,166
-Two minutes, please.
-Yes, ma'am?

530
01:05:32,916 --> 01:05:36,041
I wanted to talk about
the day before yesterday's class.

531
01:05:36,458 --> 01:05:39,250
-About the circular?
-Yes, the circular.

532
01:05:49,166 --> 01:05:50,583
Gajanan!

533
01:05:50,875 --> 01:05:52,041
Gajanan!

534
01:06:26,875 --> 01:06:30,958
Omya and I had made a telephone
using plastic cups.

535
01:06:31,291 --> 01:06:32,500
Where are we going?

536
01:06:32,583 --> 01:06:35,458
Let's go to the plateau. The view is good.

537
01:06:38,625 --> 01:06:41,791
I'll do as Omya did it.

538
01:06:46,375 --> 01:06:48,458
Two knots need to tied.

539
01:06:49,083 --> 01:06:51,000
Two knots here too.

540
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:54,458
That's not how you do it.
Give it to me.

541
01:06:55,125 --> 01:06:56,541
-Let go.
-Hold on, woman.

542
01:06:56,833 --> 01:06:57,791
Leave it.

543
01:06:59,041 --> 01:07:01,416
Hold on, I am doing it.

544
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:04,083
Just hold these sunglasses for me.

545
01:07:13,125 --> 01:07:16,625
Those belong to my dad.
Why are you wearing them?

546
01:07:17,958 --> 01:07:20,791
Have you been prescribed glasses?

547
01:07:22,708 --> 01:07:24,083
Take them off.

548
01:07:26,166 --> 01:07:28,250
Abu will give you a tight slap.

549
01:07:28,333 --> 01:07:30,208
I will complain it to him.

550
01:07:30,416 --> 01:07:31,500
Speak now.

551
01:07:31,583 --> 01:07:32,750
Hello!

552
01:07:33,083 --> 01:07:34,875
-Can you hear me?
-No.

553
01:07:38,666 --> 01:07:39,958
I can't hear you.

554
01:07:40,041 --> 01:07:41,625
You speak.

555
01:07:46,041 --> 01:07:47,500
It's not audible.

556
01:07:56,750 --> 01:07:58,083
Who?

557
01:08:03,541 --> 01:08:08,250
"I wonder where I will go
Carried away by the winds

558
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:15,708
The land is all dried up
But there is not a drop of rain

559
01:08:16,833 --> 01:08:20,583
How do I get rid of this heat?

560
01:08:21,833 --> 01:08:24,625
Droplets of rain will serve as a relief

561
01:08:24,875 --> 01:08:26,875
But where do I find them?

562
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:32,166
Then in the evening
Came a cloud carrying rain

563
01:08:33,458 --> 01:08:39,125
And he met the sunrays
In the foothills."

564
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:53,250
Today, I am going to
confess my feelings to sir.

565
01:08:55,166 --> 01:08:56,416
Shall I?

566
01:09:36,666 --> 01:09:38,916
Hey. Namrata?

567
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:41,458
Sir, I left my notebook yesterday.

568
01:09:41,666 --> 01:09:43,291
Check inside.

569
01:09:54,791 --> 01:09:56,041
Did you find it?

570
01:09:56,916 --> 01:09:58,666
No, sir. I guess it's at my house.

571
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:03,458
Then go home and check.

572
01:10:12,666 --> 01:10:13,916
What happened?

573
01:10:14,541 --> 01:10:16,458
Nothing, sir, I am leaving.

574
01:14:08,666 --> 01:14:13,083
Go to your class, girls.
The recess is over.

575
01:14:13,875 --> 01:14:14,958
Come on.

576
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:17,958
To your classrooms.

577
01:14:50,666 --> 01:14:51,875
Durva.

578
01:14:56,458 --> 01:14:57,708
Gayatri.

579
01:15:00,291 --> 01:15:01,458
Shilpa.

580
01:15:02,958 --> 01:15:04,041
Where is Shilpa?

581
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:05,750
She hasn't come today.

582
01:15:06,625 --> 01:15:07,958
I saw her in the afternoon.

583
01:15:09,333 --> 01:15:10,458
Where has Shilpa gone?

584
01:15:11,208 --> 01:15:12,583
Sir, she is absent.

585
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:14,208
Get up.

586
01:15:16,333 --> 01:15:17,375
Where is she?

587
01:15:17,458 --> 01:15:19,291
Sir, trust me, she is absent.

588
01:15:20,916 --> 01:15:25,625
Take your bag and take hers too.
Let me take you to the principal's office.

589
01:15:26,750 --> 01:15:28,250
I will distribute the rest
of the papers afterwards.

590
01:15:29,750 --> 01:15:30,625
Hurry up.

591
01:15:30,916 --> 01:15:33,208
Will you tell me where you had gone?

592
01:15:33,333 --> 01:15:34,833
-Why did you go out?
-What happened?

593
01:15:34,916 --> 01:15:37,000
-Shilpi got caught.
-Why did you go out?

594
01:15:39,291 --> 01:15:40,625
What is this?

595
01:15:41,208 --> 01:15:43,583
A cell phone? Where did you
get this cell phone from?

596
01:15:43,708 --> 01:15:47,000
Do you come to school for
all these nonsensical things?

597
01:15:47,083 --> 01:15:48,750
You bunked your class.

598
01:15:49,416 --> 01:15:52,458
Go and get your parents otherwise
don't come to school tomorrow.

599
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:11,458
Have you found a doctor yet?

600
01:17:23,416 --> 01:17:29,208
You spread like

601
01:17:30,125 --> 01:17:34,958
The whiff of the first rain

602
01:17:39,958 --> 01:17:42,625
It seemed

603
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:45,166
You were around me

604
01:17:49,791 --> 01:17:53,166
It's just a dream

605
01:18:03,375 --> 01:18:08,833
Let there be a wave

606
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:15,666
In the ocean of memories

607
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:18,958
With your footprints

608
01:18:19,833 --> 01:18:22,333
on the golden shore

609
01:18:25,875 --> 01:18:29,625
I wish you were there

610
01:18:31,208 --> 01:18:32,833
Did you get to know about Mr. Anand?

611
01:18:32,916 --> 01:18:34,458
We didn't understand it.

612
01:18:34,541 --> 01:18:37,083
Who was he?
Where did he come from? Nothing is clear.

613
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:38,708
Only Anand what happened.

614
01:18:38,833 --> 01:18:40,083
Only his head is injured.

615
01:18:40,333 --> 01:18:41,708
Yes, his head.

616
01:18:41,916 --> 01:18:43,583
He was hit hard with a wooden stick.

617
01:18:43,666 --> 01:18:45,500
The injury could've been fatal.

618
01:18:45,791 --> 01:18:47,541
It must have been some boys.

619
01:18:47,625 --> 01:18:50,375
-Such boys cannot be trusted.
-You are right!

620
01:19:23,708 --> 01:19:27,791
-Sir didn't come even today.
-I guess he quit his job.

621
01:19:27,875 --> 01:19:30,833
Stop talking nonsense!
I know sir will come back.

622
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,750
What's wrong with her?

623
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:41,208
She'll be gone soon.

624
01:19:41,291 --> 01:19:43,375
Avya, take a last look at her.

625
01:19:43,458 --> 01:19:45,416
-You won't get to see her again.
-Hey, patient!

626
01:19:50,041 --> 01:19:54,083
He took a whiff

627
01:19:56,458 --> 01:20:01,625
Of the blooming flower

628
01:20:06,583 --> 01:20:11,458
Before he left

629
01:20:16,208 --> 01:20:20,666
He gave me the gift of his memories

630
01:20:29,916 --> 01:20:34,125
Although the emotions were strong

631
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:41,041
My love twinkled like stars

632
01:20:46,708 --> 01:20:51,375
What's left with me

633
01:20:56,791 --> 01:21:02,125
Is just your memories

634
01:21:28,166 --> 01:21:31,291
The poet's name is M.M. Deshpande.

635
01:21:31,541 --> 01:21:33,666
The name of the poem is Thirst

636
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:35,625
and that's what we are
going to study today.

637
01:21:36,291 --> 01:21:37,208
Sir.

638
01:21:44,708 --> 01:21:48,208
"You must be so thirsty
That you can drink up all the darkness

639
01:21:49,666 --> 01:21:53,875
You must be able to sacrifice
Your life for the truth

640
01:21:58,041 --> 01:22:00,958
You must be humble enough
To feel the emotions of others

641
01:22:02,625 --> 01:22:06,833
May you get the kind of love
That turns stones in flowers

642
01:22:09,333 --> 01:22:13,541
You must be able to give everything away
Without boasting about it

643
01:22:14,916 --> 01:22:19,208
You must be able to respect
The soil you live in

644
01:22:21,166 --> 01:22:25,541
You must be strong enough
To endure all the pain

645
01:22:26,458 --> 01:22:29,791
Let go of all your shame
Let no fear stop you

646
01:22:33,708 --> 01:22:37,708
May your last moments

647
01:22:38,875 --> 01:22:42,875
Be like the fragrance of love"

648
01:23:07,458 --> 01:23:09,333
Let's start a new exercise today.

649
01:23:12,625 --> 01:23:13,708
Meaning,

650
01:23:14,166 --> 01:23:18,333
what will you do if this happens to you.

651
01:23:30,791 --> 01:23:31,791
Tell me.

652
01:23:46,916 --> 01:23:49,500
-Oh no.
-There is a power cut.

653
01:23:50,291 --> 01:23:51,416
There is a power cut.

654
01:23:54,041 --> 01:23:56,416
What shall we do?
Shall we wait or continue it tomorrow?

655
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:57,375
Tomorrow.

656
01:23:57,458 --> 01:23:59,041
-Tomorrow?
-Yes.

657
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,791
All right let's continue tomorrow.

658
01:24:03,541 --> 01:24:05,083
Make a move then.

659
01:24:05,958 --> 01:24:10,916
Be careful when you step out.
Watch your step.

660
01:24:25,541 --> 01:24:27,041
Namrata?

661
01:24:31,875 --> 01:24:33,250
Did you read it?

662
01:24:40,833 --> 01:24:42,541
-Sir.
-Yes.

663
01:24:45,250 --> 01:24:47,041
I like you a lot.

664
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,041
Monsoon has arrived in Maharashtra.

665
01:27:00,166 --> 01:27:01,708
Vidharbha, Konkan and the western region

666
01:27:01,791 --> 01:27:03,791
have witnessed medium
to heavy rainfall in the last few days.

667
01:27:03,875 --> 01:27:07,541
The suburbs of Mumbai too witnessed
heavy to medium rainfall.

668
01:27:07,625 --> 01:27:10,583
Lonavala witnessed light showers today

669
01:27:10,708 --> 01:27:12,708
whereas Dapoli in Ratnagiri...

670
01:27:37,750 --> 01:27:39,208
Be quick!

671
