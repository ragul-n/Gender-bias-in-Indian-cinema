''l got the price of the soil.''

49
00:05:03,132 --> 00:05:08,370
Mother, you used to say that
by making a will a person dies sooner.

50
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:13,202
And you died without making a will.

51
00:05:13,432 --> 00:05:19,171
Now l can't even say, ''Where
there is a will, there is a way.''

52
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:36,769
Look, mother.
l had invested in shares.

53
00:05:36,966 --> 00:05:37,866
Even that is incurring a loss.

54
00:05:37,933 --> 00:05:40,201
Saturn is not in a favorable position.

55
00:05:40,265 --> 00:05:43,301
And toda_,
l have to again go to the registrar.

56
00:05:44,866 --> 00:05:47,401
You didn't give a will.
At least give me blessings. Please.

57
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,300
Offer Rs.500.

58
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:53,136
The blessing of Gods and
Goddesses is also important.

59
00:06:03,032 --> 00:06:04,867
Mr. Laal. - Yes, sir.

60
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:10,069
lf l say something wrong,
you will file a case against me.

61
00:06:10,866 --> 00:06:11,833
No, sir.

62
00:06:12,032 --> 00:06:14,801
But what to do? l can't do anything.

63
00:06:15,032 --> 00:06:18,969
Look, Mr. Ranvir.
The land isn't in your mother's name.

64
00:06:19,032 --> 00:06:23,803
Sir.. - Kukreja builder
claims that your late grandpa..

65
00:06:23,866 --> 00:06:25,100
..had made a will.

66
00:06:25,165 --> 00:06:27,100
But he gave it to a trust.

67
00:06:27,733 --> 00:06:30,302
Later, the trust transferred
the entire property..

68
00:06:30,366 --> 00:06:32,367
..in Kukreja builder's name.

69
00:06:32,632 --> 00:06:34,633
No. No. That's impossible, sir.

70
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:37,301
ln my family there is no
system of making a will. - Yes.

71
00:06:37,366 --> 00:06:39,234
But legally.. - Legally.

72
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:42,235
The next generation family
has a claim on ancestral property.

73
00:06:42,299 --> 00:06:44,801
Yes. - It means,
after my grandpa's death..

74
00:06:44,866 --> 00:06:45,967
..my mother inherited the property.

75
00:06:46,032 --> 00:06:48,000
And after her death, l am
the righflul owner of this property.

76
00:06:48,065 --> 00:06:49,266
Because the paperwork..
- And your uncle.

77
00:06:49,332 --> 00:06:50,733
What? - Uncle?

78
00:06:50,933 --> 00:06:52,868
What uncle?
What do you have to do with uncle?

79
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:56,802
According to document,
if someone can claim that land..

80
00:06:56,866 --> 00:07:00,869
..after your mother's death,
it's only your uncle.

81
00:07:03,299 --> 00:07:08,170
What's his name?
- Sir, invitation from Mayu builder.

82
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,567
Madho Singh Rathore.

83
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,971
But he went away. Went far away.

84
00:07:24,032 --> 00:07:26,634
We tried to find him.
We even gave ads in the newspaper.

85
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:28,567
But.. - But we didn't
get any response, sir.

86
00:07:28,766 --> 00:07:30,801
Yes. It means, the property
should be transferred in my name.

87
00:07:30,866 --> 00:07:34,236
Sir, look. She is my mother.
The land belongs to my mother.

88
00:07:34,532 --> 00:07:35,799
What belongs to my mother why
do you want to give it to my uncle?

89
00:07:35,866 --> 00:07:40,303
And this bullshit claim of Kukreja,
this is not claim.

90
00:07:40,566 --> 00:07:41,566
This is crime.

91
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,600
Fraud and forgey.
- Look. Look.

92
00:07:43,799 --> 00:07:47,602
lf you want to file a criminal case,
why did you come here?

93
00:07:48,766 --> 00:07:51,702
l look after civil property matters.
- Yes, sir.

94
00:07:52,065 --> 00:07:54,167
And you know. You are his lawyer.

95
00:07:54,232 --> 00:07:55,566
Explain to him.

96
00:07:55,632 --> 00:07:59,702
Sir, you see,
we are searching for his uncle.

97
00:07:59,766 --> 00:08:02,068
But we got this notice
from your office.

98
00:08:02,132 --> 00:08:04,467
So we thought we will meet you.

99
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,768
Nowyou have only one chance.

00:08:14,566 --> 00:08:15,934
Then we will think.

103
00:08:17,466 --> 00:08:17,999
Yes.

104
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:20,633
Goodbye.

105
00:08:35,632 --> 00:08:36,466

Yes. He left just now.

107
00:08:38,766 --> 00:08:40,734
He had brought that
ape also along. - Yes.

108
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,866
l gave him one month's time.

109
00:08:41,933 --> 00:08:44,135
Don't wory about that.

00:08:48,199 --> 00:08:50,935
l am waiting for
him to make a mistake.

112
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,668
l will catch him there and then.

113
00:08:55,532 --> 00:08:58,968
Now howwill you escape
from Kukreja's clutches?

114
00:09:00,599 --> 00:09:03,435
l am Kukreja. From a contractor,
l will become a builder.

115
00:09:05,132 --> 00:09:09,102
No one's father can stop
Kukreja from building Sun City.

116
00:09:09,165 --> 00:09:10,799
''Hello. Pick up the phone.''

117
00:09:10,866 --> 00:09:11,900
''Once you know.''

118
00:09:11,966 --> 00:09:13,033
Whose call is it?

00:09:13,099 --> 00:09:15,167
''lt's ringing. Ringing.''

120
00:09:15,432 --> 00:09:16,499
Oh God! Salim.

121
00:09:16,566 --> 00:09:19,735
Kukreja. - Salim, hello.

122
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,133

Yes, Salim. Tell me.

lf it doesn't happen this time,
l will fix the date of your death.

00:09:38,065 --> 00:09:39,599
Mr. Laal, listen to me.

00:09:42,866 --> 00:09:45,001
lf fair means don't work,
l will use foul means.

131
00:09:45,065 --> 00:09:47,901
You just trace uncle anyhow.

132
00:09:48,632 --> 00:09:50,400
Why do you wory?

133
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:51,733
Evemhing can be done in half rate.

134
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:52,966
You just have to get it
done from the government peon.

00:09:53,032 --> 00:09:54,633
l will get it done.

136
00:09:54,699 --> 00:09:56,834

Nothing can be done without uncle.

139

Yes. Right.

143
00:10:20,699 --> 00:10:21,833
That's better.

l was also waiting. For the money.

145
00:10:29,032 --> 00:10:31,534
What is this? So less?

146
00:10:31,599 --> 00:10:33,400
Pennies for property worth billions.

147
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:36,501
Look, this is the
true state of our courts.

148
00:10:36,566 --> 00:10:39,435

There is no coyness in behavior.

316
00:22:06,165 --> 00:22:08,200
People have become shameless.

317
00:22:09,132 --> 00:22:14,237
Or else eveyone
in the world is naked.

318
00:22:15,099 --> 00:22:15,899

00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:56,236
Tell Kukreja to take the
cheque and keep it for retirement.

332
00:23:56,366 --> 00:23:58,768
When l will win the case,
he will become a pauper.

Our court's date is
not on Saturday. Right?

336

Because uncle observes
an oath of silence on Saturday.

What? Observes an oath of silence?

338

of man is your uncle?

00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:25,034
He is quite different.

But he is highly
educated and qualified.

00:25:06,632 --> 00:25:08,066
Did you see him?

354
00:25:09,232 --> 00:25:10,933
He has gone to the nearby temple.

355
00:25:11,532 --> 00:25:13,000
For veneration.

356
00:25:13,899 --> 00:25:15,066
Anything special?

357
00:25:16,466 --> 00:25:20,136
Look, you perFormed veneration
on your mother's death.

358
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,768
But he found out about
his sister's death last night.

359
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:25,767
That too from you.

360
00:25:28,132 --> 00:25:29,533
Tell me something.

361
00:25:30,632 --> 00:25:32,567
How did you remember
him after so many years?

362
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:35,501
Have you come to inquire
about his wellbeing?

363
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:38,067
Or have you come for some work?

364
00:25:39,499 --> 00:25:41,100
After mother and father's death..

365
00:25:43,099 --> 00:25:44,500
..l had become alone.

366
00:25:46,632 --> 00:25:51,069
Then l thought instead of
living alone for my whole life..

367
00:25:52,165 --> 00:25:55,034
..l come here, meet uncle.

368
00:25:56,232 --> 00:25:58,167
And take him home to Mumbai.

00:25:59,165 --> 00:26:00,399
To my house.

370
00:26:01,766 --> 00:26:03,067
l had to inform him too.

371
00:26:08,065 --> 00:26:10,967
Tell me something.
Why are you like that?

372
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:17,869
lf you had to inform him,
why didn't you find him a year ago?

373
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:28,670
Forget that your uncle
will go to Mumbai with you.

374
00:26:29,566 --> 00:26:30,700
He won't go.

375
00:26:32,866 --> 00:26:35,868

376
00:26:38,766 --> 00:26:39,766

ln desert people use camel.

531
00:36:38,032 --> 00:36:40,134
Bend. Bend.

Got the signal. Got the signal.

My decision is that Dalchand

00:37:09,399 --> 00:37:10,733
..and the wife will eat first.

541
00:37:10,766 --> 00:37:12,300
Well done, father.

He has come from Mumbai.

00:37:28,132 --> 00:37:30,267

Yes. - Arranging it.
Getting sponsorships. Nothing much.

555
00:38:01,766 --> 00:38:06,137
l understood the song and dance.
But what is a sponsor?

556
00:38:06,933 --> 00:38:09,402
Tell them. - Oka_, tell me something.

557
00:38:09,833 --> 00:38:12,302
Who plans wedding here? - l do.

558
00:38:12,699 --> 00:38:16,436
Do this. On the next full moon,
you'll plan it for free.

559
00:38:16,833 --> 00:38:20,203
Brother, have l gone
crazy to plan it for free?

560
00:38:23,866 --> 00:38:27,202

That can happen.

563
00:38:33,699 --> 00:38:35,067
And who'll arrange the food?

564
00:38:35,132 --> 00:38:36,933
Food and liquor is on me.

565
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,267
l don't have that much time.

566
00:38:39,132 --> 00:38:42,034
Pick up uncle by evening
and get the signature. - Okay.

567
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:45,268
So tell me. What is the program?

568
00:38:46,299 --> 00:38:47,733
Program?

569
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:56,101
Rajasthan's folk song and dance.

570
00:38:57,232 --> 00:39:00,735
This evening in Shekhawati
will be for Gulabo.

571
00:39:00,799 --> 00:39:04,736
Wow. Superb. Superb.

572
00:39:05,899 --> 00:39:07,867
They clap for evemhing.

573
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,668
Take care. Come here.

574
00:39:14,799 --> 00:39:16,600
You have gone mad, Ranbir.

575
00:39:17,065 --> 00:39:20,368
Gulabo will not dance in
front of public in such programs.

576
00:39:20,632 --> 00:39:21,332
Now she won't dance. That's it.

577
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:25,235
Father...
- Uncle, it's for a good cause.

578
00:39:26,065 --> 00:39:29,701
lt's the full moon. Will tourists
do the folk dance of this place..

579
00:39:29,799 --> 00:39:30,799
..if not the locals?

580
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:34,602
As if you know a lot
about the culture here?

581
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:39,269
Have you ever lived in Rajasthan?
Mr. Dholu.

582
00:39:39,933 --> 00:39:41,334
You are also like me.

583
00:39:42,733 --> 00:39:44,034
You studied abroad.

584
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:48,069
ln fact, you taught them.
So tell me, uncle.

585
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:51,635
Why did you come here after
earning so much of fame and money?

586
00:39:52,666 --> 00:39:57,270
Tell him, master. The boy
is asking so sweetly. Tell him.

587
00:39:58,766 --> 00:40:01,935
l was teaching the
foreigners there in Oxford.

588
00:40:04,733 --> 00:40:06,601
You must give back society
because your society..

589
00:40:07,799 --> 00:40:10,601
..has given you your identity.

590
00:40:12,299 --> 00:40:14,100
Understand your roots.

591
00:40:15,632 --> 00:40:17,633
Respect your culture.

592
00:40:20,833 --> 00:40:23,869
The voice was echoing in
the hall packed with foreigners.

593
00:40:26,899 --> 00:40:30,202
l wonder where this voice came from.

594
00:40:32,132 --> 00:40:37,971
Madhav Singh,
you yourself never acted on it.

595
00:40:39,666 --> 00:40:43,202
When you did you do
what you are teaching?

596
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:51,871
And l got it.
l packed my bags. Left evemhing.

597
00:40:55,933 --> 00:40:59,636
This is quite a place.
Painting in evey house.

598
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,801
l mean it's like yours. Yours is nice.

599
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,868
But where are we going?

600
00:41:06,666 --> 00:41:11,103
Hello. - Hello, brother. - God bless.

601
00:41:11,532 --> 00:41:14,935
Dholu. My sister Shakuntala's son.

602
00:41:17,666 --> 00:41:18,900
Dholu, seek their blessings. Come on.

603
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:45,600
Don't trouble me during the match.

604
00:41:45,666 --> 00:41:47,901
Uncle, don't start again.
Come, have food.

605
00:41:47,966 --> 00:41:50,234
Coming. - Good.

606
00:41:52,766 --> 00:41:54,634
Come. Have some Gatte Ki Sabzi(dish).

607
00:41:54,699 --> 00:41:57,768
Daal Baati is our famous dish.
Have one at least.

608
00:41:57,899 --> 00:41:59,700
And give me clarified butter.
Where is the clarified butter?

609
00:41:59,866 --> 00:42:01,133
Clarified butter is a must.

610
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:02,466
Why do you love
clarified butter so much?

611
00:42:02,499 --> 00:42:04,968
You will build muscles, Ranbir.
A little bit.

612
00:42:05,232 --> 00:42:09,235
lt will fall. You'll have to eat it.

613
00:42:12,666 --> 00:42:14,534
Put. - You are good at sketching.

614
00:42:14,566 --> 00:42:18,803
lf you come with me to Mumbai..

615
00:42:18,866 --> 00:42:20,167
..that'll be great fun.

616
00:42:20,833 --> 00:42:24,203
You'll get a change. - Change?

617
00:42:27,799 --> 00:42:29,834
Howwill going to
Mumbai give me a change?

618
00:42:35,466 --> 00:42:39,203
lt is a concrete jungle.
It's a concrete jungle.

619
00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:43,568
He should be riding the camel.

620
00:42:43,899 --> 00:42:47,869
lf you'd come to Mumbai,
and sign the no objection..

621
00:42:48,466 --> 00:42:50,501
..certificate of my mother's plot.

622
00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:53,735
And l could get it transferred.
It will take just 5 minutes.

623
00:42:55,466 --> 00:42:58,435
Here. Go. - Okay.

624
00:42:59,799 --> 00:43:01,934
l'll see you later. - Come on, Gattu.

625
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,068
Dholu, come here.

626
00:43:07,099 --> 00:43:13,605
Look, histoy has it
that land and property..

627
00:43:13,666 --> 00:43:15,434
.. creates rift between brothers.

628
00:43:16,766 --> 00:43:20,936
With God's grace, there is
a special thing about our family.

629
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:24,402
And that is trust. - Uncle.

630
00:43:24,866 --> 00:43:28,002
That is your land.
This is a Rajput's promise.

631
00:43:28,399 --> 00:43:30,400
Gul, the tea...

632
00:43:33,399 --> 00:43:36,702
Uncle. Look,
you are really educated. l agree.

633
00:43:37,899 --> 00:43:40,401
But promises don't mean
anything in the cities.

634
00:43:44,733 --> 00:43:47,869
There is a builder named Kukreja.
He is really big.

635
00:43:49,432 --> 00:43:51,033
He wants to grab the property.

636
00:43:51,099 --> 00:43:52,834
And since 8 months, l have been...

637
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:57,134
Please ty to understand my situation.
It is not good, uncle.

638
00:44:09,966 --> 00:44:15,671
A man who fights for his land..

639
00:44:17,466 --> 00:44:22,771
.. is a true blue Rajput.

640
00:44:25,566 --> 00:44:26,733
l didn't get you.

641
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:31,635
You will understand evemhing
when the time comes.

642
00:44:32,399 --> 00:44:35,935
Gul, don't wory.

643
00:44:37,399 --> 00:44:39,968
This is just a couplet as such.

644
00:44:41,332 --> 00:44:46,003
But the real meaning is in your blood.

645
00:44:47,399 --> 00:44:50,034
You'll understand when the time comes.

646
00:44:52,733 --> 00:44:57,270
_50 rupees. Plus 80. And you took l5.

647
00:44:57,332 --> 00:44:58,900
So _50 plus l5 is 200.

648
00:44:58,966 --> 00:45:00,400
Where did 250 go?

649
00:45:00,499 --> 00:45:02,400
You've done this addition
previously as well.

650
00:45:02,499 --> 00:45:04,801
You studied maths till
the eight grade, right?

651
00:45:05,833 --> 00:45:08,669
Because lO, 80, 90...

652
00:45:08,733 --> 00:45:09,633
Yes. Bark.

653
00:45:09,699 --> 00:45:13,436
Sir, l just saw eveyone leaving.

654
00:45:13,833 --> 00:45:17,436
We won't get a better
chance to kidnap the uncle.

655
00:45:19,566 --> 00:45:22,902
Uncle is home alone. That's great.

656
00:45:23,366 --> 00:45:25,601
We'll come to do away
with his loneliness.

657
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:37,634
Hello. Welcome.

658
00:45:47,499 --> 00:45:49,667
''Whatever has to happen,
it will happen.''

659
00:45:49,733 --> 00:45:53,403
''Eveyone asks me.
Where have you come from?''

660
00:45:53,466 --> 00:45:56,335
''Name. - My name is Jalebi Bai.
Jalebi Bai.''

661
00:45:57,032 --> 00:45:58,867
''Jalebi Bai.''

662
00:46:06,566 --> 00:46:08,334
Have you ever thought
about becoming a heroine?

663
00:46:08,566 --> 00:46:14,238
Darn it. - Heroine? l am not crazy.

664
00:46:15,299 --> 00:46:19,636
Crazy? Then think a little crazily.

665
00:46:20,499 --> 00:46:23,335
Think big. Get out of this place.

666
00:46:23,432 --> 00:46:26,535
And take Bollywood by storm.

667
00:46:27,399 --> 00:46:30,568
That's it. Tell uncle that
you want to come to Mumbai with me.

668
00:46:31,265 --> 00:46:33,800
No. l am sory. Father
saysyou have to become corrupt..

669
00:46:33,866 --> 00:46:35,534
..before you become a heroine.

670
00:46:36,632 --> 00:46:39,434
No. No. It's not that.
You have a wrong notion.

671
00:46:40,199 --> 00:46:41,767
What? - You have a wrong family.

672
00:46:43,632 --> 00:46:46,501
Your father.
He is telling you wrong things.

673
00:46:54,833 --> 00:46:57,202
Do you really think that l dance well?

674
00:47:00,833 --> 00:47:04,236
Okay. So you guys are kidnapping me?

675
00:47:04,466 --> 00:47:06,534
Hello. Hello. - Hello.

676
00:47:06,833 --> 00:47:10,636
Look, tell me when you
feel right as to who are you..

677
00:47:10,699 --> 00:47:13,134
..and where are you taking me?

678
00:47:13,532 --> 00:47:16,434
Hello. Hello, uncle.
- God bless. No worries.

679
00:47:16,499 --> 00:47:18,367
He is bigger than police.
He is our uncle.

680
00:47:19,366 --> 00:47:21,434
Today all the problems will be over.

681
00:47:21,666 --> 00:47:23,868
And Kukreja will become
builder number one.

682
00:47:24,232 --> 00:47:26,567
How is...how is the
business of kidnapping?

683
00:47:26,799 --> 00:47:29,701
Do you do any other business
in your spare time or no?

684
00:47:30,132 --> 00:47:31,766
Who is the dealer? - You. You.

685
00:47:31,833 --> 00:47:34,135
Keep quiet. Shut him up.

686
00:47:34,432 --> 00:47:36,300
We have kidnapped him.
But he is torturing us.

687
00:47:36,366 --> 00:47:38,434
No. No. Gag him. Gag him.

688
00:47:38,499 --> 00:47:40,601
Show me your hand. - Get lost, uncle.

689
00:47:44,265 --> 00:47:48,469
Jalebi. Jalebi. Bye.

690
00:47:51,399 --> 00:47:54,902
What did l tell you?
Out with my _25 bucks.

691
00:47:55,332 --> 00:47:57,133
What do l sa_, Parikh?

692
00:47:57,466 --> 00:47:59,067
l don't have much money either.

693
00:47:59,132 --> 00:48:02,335
That's why l suggest you buy it now.
Now is the time.

694
00:48:02,499 --> 00:48:04,500
l don't understand what l should buy.

695
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:08,302
Buy fertilizer. Fertilizer.

696
00:48:09,332 --> 00:48:10,766
Girl, would you like to eat something?

697
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:15,736
Parikh, buy fertilizer. - Fertilizer?

698
00:48:16,299 --> 00:48:17,833
Yes. Fertilizer. - Alright, brother.

699
00:48:20,699 --> 00:48:22,367
l am buying it on your suggestion.

700
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:25,368
You win all the bets, right.

Okay. - Don't wory.

Don't you have anything else to do?
Good for nothing.

00:50:36,532 --> 00:50:38,333
The plan of the signature
has been cancelled.

736
00:50:38,666 --> 00:50:42,503

Get us out of this sea of sand.

00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:11,467
O Lord, we are you children.

743
00:51:11,532 --> 00:51:13,333
Goodness counts for
nothing these days.

744

Uncle, look at him.
He has two lovely wives.

01:02:07,132 --> 01:02:09,300
Your own building looks so nice
when you look at it from down there.

874
01:02:09,933 --> 01:02:11,434
lt looks scay from above.

875
01:02:11,933 --> 01:02:15,236
Look at that.
The heights. Tall buildings.

876
01:02:16,132 --> 01:02:21,003
Now look down.
What is that? Shakuntala Niwas.

877
01:02:21,399 --> 01:02:23,167
A small bird's nest.

878
01:02:25,265 --> 01:02:27,333
The rest have gone so far ahead.

879
01:02:27,766 --> 01:02:28,933
And he is still where he was.

880
01:02:30,499 --> 01:02:32,200
Don't you see his pain?

881
01:02:33,032 --> 01:02:36,101
l can. He cries evey night.

882
01:02:36,699 --> 01:02:40,102
Kukreja sir,
l also want to touch the sky.

883
01:02:40,265 --> 01:02:43,434
l also want someone to
jump by a parachute from my roof.

884
01:02:45,933 --> 01:02:48,101
So that's why l say
that join hands with me.

885
01:02:49,699 --> 01:02:51,700
You solve a small problem of mine.

886
01:02:52,065 --> 01:02:53,800
l will make sure you benefit greatly.

887
01:02:54,766 --> 01:02:55,867
l will give you 3 crore rupees.

888
01:02:59,199 --> 01:03:01,801
So is the deal on? - Done.

889
01:03:03,699 --> 01:03:04,900
Listen.

890
01:03:07,866 --> 01:03:09,867
Hey, what are you doing?

891
01:03:10,966 --> 01:03:13,902
But not in 3 crores.
- Then? - 25 crores.

892
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:21,003
Actually Mr. Kukreja,
the rate of dowy has gone up.

893
01:03:23,366 --> 01:03:26,202
So is the deal on?

894
01:03:28,399 --> 01:03:29,333
Let go.

895
01:03:31,132 --> 01:03:33,667
People keep ringing
bells all the time.

896
01:03:33,699 --> 01:03:36,134
People don't ring
temple bells so much.

897
01:03:36,199 --> 01:03:39,936
Yes. Welcome. - What is this?

898
01:03:40,065 --> 01:03:43,101
Who are you?
Call the boy who lives here.

899
01:03:43,332 --> 01:03:45,634
Okay. Okay. You are Ranbir's friend.

900
01:03:45,666 --> 01:03:48,201
Welcome.
Welcome. - l am the secretay.

901
01:03:48,666 --> 01:03:51,235
Ranbir didn't tell me that
he has hired a secretay as well.

902
01:03:51,299 --> 01:03:53,968
Not his.
l am this building's secretay.

903
01:03:54,032 --> 01:03:58,603
l am your neighbour.
You can't roam around naked like this.

904
01:03:58,766 --> 01:04:02,102
Welcome. Welcome. l am Ranbir's uncle.

905
01:04:02,165 --> 01:04:05,668
Madhav Singh Rathore.
l've come from Rajasthan. Come.

906
01:04:05,733 --> 01:04:06,667
Let's have a cup of tea.

907
01:04:06,899 --> 01:04:09,167
l am Swatantra Bharat Bhushan.
- Nice name.

908
01:04:09,232 --> 01:04:13,336
l don't have time for tea.
And what is all this?

909
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:17,736
Painting. - This building has
been painted with the society fund.

910
01:04:17,899 --> 01:04:20,635
Painting on it is prohibited. Get it?

911
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,903
Send Ranbir to the
society office immediately.

912
01:04:24,933 --> 01:04:27,635
To report.
One more thing. This...Gross.

913
01:04:30,299 --> 01:04:34,536
This is vulgarity.
Morever, destroying society property.

914
01:04:34,933 --> 01:04:36,167
Disgusting.

915
01:05:06,032 --> 01:05:09,769
''Don't consider us
kids and mess with us.''

916
01:05:09,833 --> 01:05:13,303
''We are maniacs.
Don't go by the size.''

917
01:05:13,666 --> 01:05:15,300
''We are little. But we are brutes.''

918
01:05:15,566 --> 01:05:17,134
''We are devils.''

919
01:05:26,899 --> 01:05:29,701
Small plants.
Small scissors. Small temples.

920
01:05:29,766 --> 01:05:35,138
Small Gods.
Small venerations. Small...

921
01:05:37,899 --> 01:05:41,068
Darn you.
Girl, what you have you worn?

922
01:05:45,132 --> 01:05:49,102
Gheru, come on.
We'll be late for the audition.

923
01:05:49,132 --> 01:05:54,804
''Our gait is wacky.
Our style is wacky''

924
01:05:54,866 --> 01:05:58,669
''All Hail. Our game is wacky.''

925
01:05:58,733 --> 01:06:01,102
Tell Nissan not to move from there.

926
01:06:01,566 --> 01:06:03,701
And ask others to
follow him on the bike.

927
01:06:03,766 --> 01:06:05,467
Ask Diwakar to...

928
01:06:05,532 --> 01:06:08,868
Darn it. What's with
the name of goons these days?

929
01:06:09,165 --> 01:06:12,001
Boss, all is good.
Eveyone has taken their positions.

930
01:06:12,165 --> 01:06:16,802
Yes, boss. He is twirling
his moustaches right now.

931
01:06:17,165 --> 01:06:19,901
Uncle is coming this way.
- Stop the commenty.

932
01:06:19,966 --> 01:06:21,801
And give me the live feed. - Okay.

933
01:06:21,966 --> 01:06:23,000
The car is approaching, sir.

934
01:06:24,766 --> 01:06:28,002
He is still dancing. Hey...hit him.

935
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:34,902
The car slipped.
And he missed uncle, sir.

936
01:06:34,966 --> 01:06:36,801
Missed him? Missed him.

937
01:06:36,833 --> 01:06:39,135
You couldn't hit such a
small man with such a big car.

938
01:06:39,566 --> 01:06:41,434
You are good for nothing.

939
01:06:42,032 --> 01:06:44,167
l wish you had been
run over by that car.

940
01:06:44,766 --> 01:06:48,402
Missed him.
Was there a banana skin on the road?

941
01:06:48,466 --> 01:06:49,834
Yes. - What is he doing?

942
01:06:50,866 --> 01:06:54,169
Uncle is looking here
and there like a maniac, sir.

943
01:06:54,566 --> 01:06:58,836
Maniac. Maniac. Listen to me.

944
01:06:59,566 --> 01:07:02,602
Rush to the nearby police station.

945
01:07:02,666 --> 01:07:05,668
And tell them that uncle
has caused this accident.

946
01:07:05,866 --> 01:07:07,767
And tell them that he is a maniac.

947
01:07:07,899 --> 01:07:10,701
He should either be in the police
station or at the mental asylum.

948
01:07:10,899 --> 01:07:12,400
Okay. Okay.

949
01:07:15,733 --> 01:07:18,669
Hi. - Hey...Arjun.

950
01:07:29,666 --> 01:07:31,667
Hello. Hello.

951
01:07:39,532 --> 01:07:43,168
l'll get Gul auditioned.
You stay right here.

952
01:07:48,699 --> 01:07:49,766
No. l will not be able to dance here.

953
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:51,534
lt's all good, Gul.

954
01:07:51,866 --> 01:07:54,034
There are so many people here.
This is really weird.

955
01:07:54,065 --> 01:07:55,833
l will not be able to do it.
And this...

956
01:07:59,799 --> 01:08:02,902
What are you doing? One minute.

957
01:08:04,065 --> 01:08:06,100
Until today,
only l was your fan, right?

958
01:08:07,532 --> 01:08:10,534
l promise. You go inside and dance.

959
01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:13,768
All of them will

960
01:08:14,899 --> 01:08:17,868
So you need not fear. l am there.

961
01:08:24,833 --> 01:08:27,835
You? What are you doing here?

962
01:08:28,165 --> 01:08:31,501
This is Gul.
l have brought her here for audition.

963
01:08:35,532 --> 01:08:37,934
This is the onlyjob you can do now.

964
01:08:38,566 --> 01:08:42,603
You beguile girls,
showthem big dreams..

965
01:08:42,666 --> 01:08:45,602
..bring them here
and get them auditioned.

966
01:08:45,733 --> 01:08:49,369
You...you need courage to dream.

967
01:08:49,599 --> 01:08:52,501
And you need just a
sharp tongue to talk trash.

968
01:08:52,733 --> 01:08:54,501
Someone might have
explained this before.

969
01:08:54,566 --> 01:08:55,967
But you didn't get it, did you?

970
01:08:56,032 --> 01:08:59,001
Because you have no brains.

971
01:08:59,532 --> 01:09:01,667
Come on, Ranbir. Move.

972
01:09:03,332 --> 01:09:04,366
Superb.

973
01:09:14,733 --> 01:09:16,634
Can we start please?
- One minute please.

974
01:09:17,632 --> 01:09:18,399
Come on.

975
01:09:31,833 --> 01:09:34,969
''l had never imagined in
my dreams that l will be so happy.''

976
01:09:35,032 --> 01:09:36,700
Let's go, brother Gheru.

977
01:09:36,766 --> 01:09:41,670
'There has been a horrific accident# 

978
01:09:42,299 --> 01:09:44,934
'lt is said that an old
man has caused this accident'

979
01:09:47,566 --> 01:09:48,366
Father.

980
01:09:49,366 --> 01:09:51,401
We let him go out
for the first time and...

981
01:09:51,599 --> 01:09:53,400
Ranbir, this... - And he got arrested.

982
01:09:55,599 --> 01:09:57,300
Come on, Gul. Come on.

983
01:10:03,566 --> 01:10:05,834
Master. - Father. - Master.

984
01:10:05,899 --> 01:10:08,601
Master. - Father. - Master.

985
01:10:08,733 --> 01:10:12,470
l am sory. - Father. - One minute.

986
01:10:12,532 --> 01:10:13,599
Father, listen.

987
01:10:16,799 --> 01:10:18,834
Oh, Mr. Singh.

988
01:10:19,499 --> 01:10:24,804
Mr. Singh, your uncle has gone insane.

989
01:10:26,599 --> 01:10:29,301
You need to get his
mental state checked.

990
01:10:29,366 --> 01:10:31,367
So we'll keep him in his custody.

991
01:10:31,432 --> 01:10:32,699
Mentally unstable. Are you...

992
01:10:32,899 --> 01:10:35,835
Look, he is a vey well
respected and educated man.

993
01:10:36,199 --> 01:10:37,600
Look.. - Look Mr. Singh.

994
01:10:37,799 --> 01:10:40,635
Educated people fall
victim to madness.

995
01:10:41,532 --> 01:10:45,369
This gentleman, Mr. Prem
is the eye witness of this incident.

996
01:10:45,699 --> 01:10:48,935
He has testified.
He was getting a hair cut..

997
01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:50,400
..in Sakhi Hair Salon.

998
01:10:50,599 --> 01:10:52,267
Right, Mr. Prem? - Yes.

999
01:10:52,466 --> 01:10:53,733
And we have checked with him.

1000
01:10:54,232 --> 01:10:56,867
And he has given witness
that you uncle stopped..

1001
01:10:56,933 --> 01:10:59,368
..in the middle of the road.

1002
01:10:59,566 --> 01:11:00,967
And started dancing in
the middle of the street..

1003
01:11:01,232 --> 01:11:02,666
..listening to song on a headphone.

1004
01:11:03,632 --> 01:11:07,202
Look, uncle. It's Saturday today.
And it's Sunday tomorrow.

1005
01:11:07,399 --> 01:11:09,400
lf you don't say anything,
howwill l...

1006
01:11:11,866 --> 01:11:15,569
Son, it's Saturday.
He doesn't talk on Saturdays.

1007
01:11:15,699 --> 01:11:17,333
He won't talk.

1008
01:11:18,332 --> 01:11:20,901
A horrific accident
happened in Oshiwara today.

1009
01:11:20,933 --> 01:11:22,634
The damage was heavy.

1010
01:11:22,666 --> 01:11:24,300
We shouldn't have come to Mumbai.

1011
01:11:24,466 --> 01:11:27,635
Father was right.
We should've never listened to you.

1012
01:11:27,666 --> 01:11:30,335
lt is said that this man's
mental state is not right.

1013
01:11:30,399 --> 01:11:33,668
Through the CCN footage
in Bright Electronics..

1014
01:11:33,733 --> 01:11:37,603
..we want to ask you as to
who is responsible for this accident.

1015
01:11:37,766 --> 01:11:40,401
And that man is mad.

1016
01:11:40,566 --> 01:11:43,335
Terrorists were the only
threat to this city until today.

1017
01:11:43,399 --> 01:11:45,567
Oh yes.

1018
01:11:45,632 --> 01:11:47,533
We need to check
with our correspondent.

1019
01:11:47,566 --> 01:11:50,235
What has got you so excited?

1020
01:11:50,299 --> 01:11:52,734
This is Mumbai.
There are cameras eve_here.

1021
01:11:52,799 --> 01:11:54,667
Evemhing will be
clear tomorrow. Yes.

1022
01:12:05,165 --> 01:12:07,200
Sir, we found this
from the shop's recording.

1023
01:12:13,733 --> 01:12:19,438
This footage shows that this
accident happened due to this car.

1024
01:12:19,566 --> 01:12:20,667
Yes.

1025
01:12:20,733 --> 01:12:25,737
We'll have to evict him and
his mad uncle out of the society.

1026
01:12:26,132 --> 01:12:28,501
Do you understand?
We'll have to evict them.

1027
01:12:28,566 --> 01:12:30,701
He roams around in the society naked.

1028
01:12:30,766 --> 01:12:32,667
What effect will this
have on our society?

1029
01:12:32,733 --> 01:12:38,438
And his nephewwas caught
bribing on national television.

1030
01:12:38,733 --> 01:12:41,469
Think of the devil and devil is here.

1031
01:12:41,599 --> 01:12:44,468
Come here all of you. Quick.

1032
01:12:45,099 --> 01:12:48,268
Members, this is the
person l was talking about.

1033
01:12:48,366 --> 01:12:51,268
He should be thrown out
of the society immediately.

1034
01:12:59,399 --> 01:13:05,271
Lord, forgive them for
they know not what they do.

1035
01:13:29,366 --> 01:13:30,133
Sir.

1036
01:13:43,132 --> 01:13:44,166
What did you see?

1037
01:13:49,099 --> 01:13:50,233
Nothing, sir.

1038
01:13:54,065 --> 01:13:54,999
Come to the point.

1039
01:13:55,065 --> 01:13:56,566
Why did you come in without knocking?

1040
01:13:56,766 --> 01:14:01,203
l had entered uncle's mansion
after those people left.

1041
01:14:01,399 --> 01:14:03,300
l found this photo there, sir.

1042
01:14:04,499 --> 01:14:06,601
And sir, there l came
to knowthat this man..

1043
01:14:06,666 --> 01:14:10,403
.is Ranbir's mother's brother.
Her elder brother at that.

1044
01:14:13,499 --> 01:14:15,534
What the heck! Yet another uncle.

1045
01:14:15,699 --> 01:14:16,699
Uncle galore.

1046
01:14:16,766 --> 01:14:21,237
And l also found out that this
man had gone missing a fewyears ago.

1047
01:14:21,432 --> 01:14:24,067
No problem. Your promotion is on.

1048
01:14:24,132 --> 01:14:25,500
Your salay will be
double from next year.

1049
01:14:25,666 --> 01:14:28,135
Find him. Find him. Here.

1050
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:33,204
He also went missing.
All of them are forgeflul.

1051
01:14:38,332 --> 01:14:42,536
Flat no. 8O_. 8O_.

1052
01:14:42,599 --> 01:14:47,570
Remember this. Either get the sign
tonight or resign from this business.

1053
01:14:47,933 --> 01:14:49,067
Get it?

1054
01:14:54,132 --> 01:14:56,400
Leave me. You don't who l am.

1055
01:14:56,466 --> 01:15:00,036
Leave me. l will get you arrested.

1056
01:15:00,232 --> 01:15:01,166
Leave me. Where are you taking me?

1057
01:15:01,232 --> 01:15:02,933
Keep quiet or l'll blowyour head off.

1058
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,935
l'll blowyour head off. Leave me.

1059
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,268
Forget the servant.
Find the boss first.

1060
01:15:07,332 --> 01:15:08,032
Leave me.

1061
01:15:08,099 --> 01:15:09,333
Tell me where is the uncle and nephew.

1062
01:15:09,499 --> 01:15:10,933
Shall we call the police?

1063
01:15:11,599 --> 01:15:15,369
Pizza arrives first in Mumbai.
And then the fire brigade.

1064
01:15:15,432 --> 01:15:16,966
And then the police follow.

1065
01:15:17,332 --> 01:15:21,169
So order pizza first.
Do they have guns?

1066
01:15:24,532 --> 01:15:27,368
Leave me. - Darn it. Run.

1067
01:15:31,165 --> 01:15:32,266
Come on. - Where the hell is eveyone?

1068
01:15:35,065 --> 01:15:37,333
Come on. Come on. Run. Run. Run.

1069
01:15:37,399 --> 01:15:38,900
l am the secretay.

1070
01:15:43,132 --> 01:15:45,601
l am the secretay.
He is calling me a servant.

1071
01:15:57,432 --> 01:16:01,335
ldiot. Rascal. Knucklehead.

1072
01:16:01,966 --> 01:16:06,303
The people l was thinking
of throwing out of the society..

1073
01:16:06,399 --> 01:16:11,170
..today those vey people saved
my life risking their own lives.

1074
01:16:11,332 --> 01:16:15,069
You are ungrateful.
You are an idiot. Please forgive me.

1075
01:16:15,099 --> 01:16:18,569
Please. Please. - It's okay.

1076
01:16:21,165 --> 01:16:23,967
Kukreja, you will always
remain a contractor.

1077
01:16:24,499 --> 01:16:26,033
You'll never become a builder.

1078
01:16:26,232 --> 01:16:28,500
Salim, he is not a man.
He is a cocktail between..

1079
01:16:28,566 --> 01:16:31,201
..Rajnikant and Gandhi.

1080
01:16:31,399 --> 01:16:35,202
l have tried so many times.
He survives evey time.

1081
01:16:36,165 --> 01:16:40,035
l am coming in two days.
If you don't get the job done..

1082
01:16:40,099 --> 01:16:44,136
..by then, Kukreja will
not see the light of the next day.

1083
01:16:45,432 --> 01:16:47,400
Boss, don't say such things.

1084
01:16:47,466 --> 01:16:51,937
lf you can't do it, then
call my brother. And call his men.

1085
01:16:52,132 --> 01:16:54,868
There are only two days left.
Heard that?

1086
01:16:54,899 --> 01:16:56,000
Only two days.

1087
01:16:56,299 --> 01:17:01,470
Not only a contractor. Kakreja
will become a builder. For sure.

1088
01:17:14,399 --> 01:17:18,202
What are you looking at?
Go and eat that rascal.

1089
01:17:19,099 --> 01:17:21,134
Pick up the phone. Pick up the phone.

1090
01:17:23,399 --> 01:17:25,501
The phone is ringing.
The phone is ringing.

1091
01:17:26,933 --> 01:17:27,967
Bark.

1092
01:17:30,299 --> 01:17:31,133
What?!

1093
01:17:34,199 --> 01:17:38,870
Well done.
Well done, champ. Well done.

1094
01:17:39,232 --> 01:17:41,834
Bring him by the first flight.

1095
01:17:41,899 --> 01:17:44,101
He should be here tomorrow morning.

1096
01:17:44,165 --> 01:17:46,200
Well done. Well done.

1097
01:17:47,432 --> 01:17:50,835
Why didn't you make me sit
on the two buses at Mumbai? Why?

1098
01:17:51,165 --> 01:17:53,467
Calm down. What is the need for
buses when there is such a nice car?

1099
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:00,533
Hello.

1100
01:18:02,499 --> 01:18:05,068
Yes. l am Ranveer.
l had come for the audition of Gulabo.

1101
01:18:05,265 --> 01:18:07,867
Let me hear it too..
- Yes, yes. One minute.

1102
01:18:08,065 --> 01:18:08,999
Yes.

1103
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,935
Yes. -What happened?
What are they saying?

1104
01:18:12,899 --> 01:18:13,899
Yes. Thank you.

1105
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:16,900
What happened?

1106
01:18:19,032 --> 01:18:21,033
Hey, tell me. What did they say?

1107
01:18:27,099 --> 01:18:29,067
For the semi finals, your selection..

1108
01:18:30,199 --> 01:18:30,832
Has been done.

1109
01:18:30,899 --> 01:18:31,966
Wow. Fool. This is great.

1110
01:18:32,799 --> 01:18:34,734
l am going to dance like this. -
So you are a woman from Mumbai, right?

1111
01:19:06,332 --> 01:19:07,800
l think you are joking here.

1112
01:19:09,165 --> 01:19:13,002
Hey, l am telling you.
l am a builder. Not a gangster.

1113
01:19:13,766 --> 01:19:15,467
Just sell it and take
the sum of 5 crores.

1114
01:19:15,866 --> 01:19:17,767
That is it. Take this.

1115
01:19:19,165 --> 01:19:20,399
You don't have to do anything.
You just have to sign.

1116
01:19:20,466 --> 01:19:23,468
Read it. The sum of 5 crores is a lot.

1117
01:19:35,032 --> 01:19:37,367
Look, Mr. Kukreja.

1118
01:19:37,432 --> 01:19:41,869
Stop dreaming of making
a building on our ancestral land.

1119
01:19:42,399 --> 01:19:44,400
You will never be
able to get the land.

1120
01:19:48,399 --> 01:19:49,800
Come on. That is okay.

1121
01:19:52,332 --> 01:19:55,768
Here you are. Your youth. Take this.

1122
01:19:55,833 --> 01:19:56,867
Even you can take a look.

1123
01:19:58,399 --> 01:20:00,200
l am sure you knowthem.

1124
01:20:00,899 --> 01:20:02,967
They were running
a kite shop in Rohtak.

1125
01:20:03,366 --> 01:20:04,700
l called them by flight.

1126
01:20:04,899 --> 01:20:06,100
ln order to make them recognize you.

1127
01:20:07,733 --> 01:20:10,869
They are restless to claim
their right on their ancestral land.

1128
01:20:12,766 --> 01:20:13,700
Uncle, they..

1129
01:20:13,966 --> 01:20:15,000
Don't wory about them.

1130
01:20:17,666 --> 01:20:18,333
Who are they?

1131
01:20:18,866 --> 01:20:20,801
Your uncle.
Take a look. - Whose uncle?

1132
01:20:21,265 --> 01:20:22,866
Please get out of here.

1133
01:20:42,899 --> 01:20:43,833
Yes. - Yes.

1134
01:20:43,899 --> 01:20:45,333
Just as kids are born eveyday
in the houses of people..

1135
01:20:45,599 --> 01:20:47,734
..a new uncle is born
here eveyday. l am..

1136
01:20:48,632 --> 01:20:51,001
Brother Suresh is my elder brother.

1137
01:20:51,833 --> 01:20:52,800
For the name sake.

1138
01:20:54,733 --> 01:20:56,835
His father, the great Parvat Singh..

1139
01:20:56,899 --> 01:20:58,667
..used to work at our place.

1140
01:20:58,733 --> 01:21:02,036
Your maternal grandfather
used to treat him as his son.

1141
01:21:02,199 --> 01:21:06,036
Suresh and l have been brought
up together as my brother.

1142
01:21:06,833 --> 01:21:10,903
After l went off to London
and after the marriage of Shakuntala..

1143
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:13,935
..brother Suresh
disappeared somewhere.

1144
01:21:14,833 --> 01:21:19,370
Along with some money
and some jewely.

1145
01:21:20,366 --> 01:21:21,867
Fallen thief.

1146
01:21:22,799 --> 01:21:25,768
And today? Today,
he has been found after so long.

1147
01:21:25,966 --> 01:21:28,234
And the scoundrel has shown
his true colors once more.

1148
01:21:30,065 --> 01:21:32,200
Please forgive me, my lord.

1149
01:21:32,866 --> 01:21:35,034
But these people should
be hung downwards from a tree..

1150
01:21:35,099 --> 01:21:38,035
..and they should be treated vey badly
and thrashed with a stick and.. - Bhairon.

1151
01:21:38,099 --> 01:21:40,234
Bhairon. Don't be rude.

1152
01:21:44,833 --> 01:21:48,536
Listen to me.
Make a call at the village.

1153
01:21:52,966 --> 01:21:53,800
Come on.

1154
01:21:53,966 --> 01:21:56,101
Yes. Yes. Please. Please, make a call.

1155
01:21:56,566 --> 01:21:57,867
Tell them that l
am coming there as well.

1156
01:21:58,199 --> 01:21:59,867
After twenty years,
l will sit with you..

1157
01:21:59,933 --> 01:22:01,267
..and recite poems for you.

1158
01:22:01,799 --> 01:22:04,101
Decked up and with attitude, Rajput..

1159
01:22:04,232 --> 01:22:06,167
And all of that.. - l told you, Dholu.

1160
01:22:07,733 --> 01:22:09,201
Evemhing will be fine.
Don't wory at all.

1161
01:22:10,632 --> 01:22:11,632
Raichand.

1162
01:22:11,699 --> 01:22:12,699
Don't wory at all.

1163
01:22:12,966 --> 01:22:14,567
Just listen to evemhing
and speak only after that.

1164
01:22:14,632 --> 01:22:18,168
Hey, dear, we don't have to cary
our land and property when we die.

1165
01:22:18,632 --> 01:22:19,766
Don't wory.

1166
01:22:29,866 --> 01:22:31,934
l think you have
really become a priest.

1167
01:22:32,132 --> 01:22:32,899
Yes.

1168
01:22:33,699 --> 01:22:35,133
lt is a good idea though.

1169
01:22:35,199 --> 01:22:36,934
Whenever there is
a difficult situation..

1170
01:22:37,132 --> 01:22:41,803
..you can get relaxed after
saying something spiritual.

1171
01:22:42,099 --> 01:22:45,769
Exit. Dholu. Don't wory.

1172
01:22:46,165 --> 01:22:48,467
Uncle, there is a fire. Don't wory.

1173
01:22:48,632 --> 01:22:50,033
Don't wory at all.

1174
01:22:50,799 --> 01:22:52,767
This wory will get
us in a mess one day.

1175
01:22:54,466 --> 01:22:56,701
Hey, watch my dance.
It is for the semi finals.

1176
01:22:57,032 --> 01:22:58,133
What happened here?

1177
01:22:58,866 --> 01:23:01,001
Bulbul, leave me alone for some time.

1178
01:23:02,866 --> 01:23:03,533
Why?

1179
01:23:03,599 --> 01:23:04,833
Because l am in a bad mood.

1180
01:23:07,866 --> 01:23:09,100
l had a nice property.

1181
01:23:09,132 --> 01:23:11,734
And l lost it because
of a new problem.

1182
01:23:17,566 --> 01:23:18,466
Oka_, tell me something.

1183
01:23:20,132 --> 01:23:21,700
What would you do with the land?

1184
01:23:27,499 --> 01:23:28,233
l would have bought a new house.

1185
01:23:29,532 --> 01:23:30,499
Sea facing. Okay?

1186
01:23:30,632 --> 01:23:31,799
BMW car.

1187
01:23:32,733 --> 01:23:33,967
Okay. Then?

1188
01:23:35,833 --> 01:23:36,867
l would have gone on
a trip around the world.

1189
01:23:38,799 --> 01:23:39,432
Then?

1190
01:23:41,933 --> 01:23:43,000
Then? Then what?

1191
01:23:43,799 --> 01:23:44,566
l would have been rich.

1192
01:23:46,632 --> 01:23:48,700
He_, so what is the problem?

1193
01:23:49,699 --> 01:23:50,666
lf it is about money only..

1194
01:23:50,733 --> 01:23:52,734
..when l win the dance competition..

1195
01:23:52,833 --> 01:23:54,668
..l will give the entire money to you.

1196
01:23:54,733 --> 01:23:57,001
You will be able to buy
all your stuff with that, right?

1197
01:24:01,065 --> 01:24:01,932
l am here, right?

1198
01:24:10,966 --> 01:24:13,868
Are you that confident? Will you win?

1199
01:24:15,432 --> 01:24:15,965
Yes.

1200
01:24:16,799 --> 01:24:18,867
You are the one who
says that l dance vey well.

1201
01:24:19,432 --> 01:24:22,168
lf l spread my wings,
l will win Mumbai over.

1202
01:24:25,899 --> 01:24:26,933
Do you trust me that much?

1203
01:24:28,466 --> 01:24:30,801
Yes. Why not?

1204
01:24:31,599 --> 01:24:32,433
You are a Rajput.

1205
01:24:32,532 --> 01:24:34,033
And that is the word of a Rajput.

1206
01:24:34,332 --> 01:24:36,667
l am sure you will keep your word.

1207
01:24:41,799 --> 01:24:44,768
Come on. Dance for me.

1208
01:24:45,499 --> 01:24:46,366
Okay.

1209
01:24:48,032 --> 01:24:50,067
Where have you been for
all these years, brother?

1210
01:24:50,332 --> 01:24:51,066
Where?

1211
01:24:51,766 --> 01:24:55,402
Without you,
my whole life was lonely, brother.

1212
01:24:55,766 --> 01:24:57,734
Brother Suresh is my elder brother.

1213
01:24:58,499 --> 01:24:59,900
Did you hear that, sir?

1214
01:25:00,432 --> 01:25:04,969
Brother Suresh. Brother Suresh.
He means elder brother.

1215
01:25:05,632 --> 01:25:10,436
Elder brother. He is Suresh.
The real heir of this land.

1216
01:25:10,666 --> 01:25:12,401
And you can see the
Iove between brothers.

1217
01:25:12,833 --> 01:25:14,601
So sir, hail God..

1218
01:25:14,866 --> 01:25:17,401
According to Hindi
undivided property law..

1219
01:25:17,566 --> 01:25:20,602
..elder brother is the
first person to inherit.

1220
01:25:21,666 --> 01:25:26,604
So sir, actually this is
his signed will. For my name.

1221
01:25:26,766 --> 01:25:28,701
Will? What will?

1222
01:25:28,933 --> 01:25:31,101
Mr. Singh, after seeing all this..

1223
01:25:31,366 --> 01:25:34,001
.. l am convinced that
Kukreja's claim is correct.

1224
01:25:34,399 --> 01:25:35,600
What is this, Pudhe sir?

1225
01:25:35,666 --> 01:25:37,701
ln order to record the
statement of our uncle..

1226
01:25:37,766 --> 01:25:39,701
..you got him here all
the way from the village.

1227
01:25:39,899 --> 01:25:43,502
Since two weeks, you have been
verifying all his documents. It is okay.

1228
01:25:43,899 --> 01:25:46,601
But you agreed to the statement
of this man in one go?

1229
01:25:46,766 --> 01:25:53,706
My name is Swatantra Bharat Bhushan.
l have made an IAS officer go tojail.

1230
01:25:53,933 --> 01:25:56,268
ln my presence, think over the
decision carefully before you take it.

1231
01:25:56,566 --> 01:25:57,700
Who is this? Who is this?

1232
01:25:58,866 --> 01:26:03,036
You are absolutely right, Mr.
Bhushan. But l really have no choice.

1233
01:26:03,299 --> 01:26:04,900
l have no other way.

1234
01:26:05,366 --> 01:26:09,002
Dholu. He is your elder uncle.
Greet him.

1235
01:26:09,532 --> 01:26:11,901
Brother. He is Dholu. Your nephew.

1236
01:26:12,666 --> 01:26:15,835
He is the son of our
younger sister Shakuntala.

1237
01:26:16,699 --> 01:26:18,367
Shakuntala is no more.

1238
01:26:19,432 --> 01:26:20,533
She is gone.

1239
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,335
And he is Shakuntala's sign.

1240
01:26:23,399 --> 01:26:24,533
Take his blessings.

1241
01:26:24,766 --> 01:26:26,667
The same sign that you
are giving off to Kukreja.

1242
01:26:26,733 --> 01:26:28,801
Dholu. Take his blessings.
- Greetings.

1243
01:26:31,299 --> 01:26:34,869
Brother. Brother, let us go home.
We have lots to talk about.

1244
01:26:35,399 --> 01:26:36,800
Yes. Talk. Talk as much as you want.

1245
01:26:36,866 --> 01:26:39,902
Go wherever you want to after
you give your thumb print here.

1246
01:26:40,399 --> 01:26:41,433
l will send the
tickets for the flight.

1247
01:26:41,799 --> 01:26:44,668
. Come on.
Come on. Come on, come on, come on.

1248
01:26:45,966 --> 01:26:47,867
Come on.
Come on. Give it to me, brother.

1249
01:26:47,933 --> 01:26:49,434
Suresh, sign here.

1250
01:26:51,466 --> 01:26:53,467
Come on.
You have to sign at three places.

1251
01:26:53,532 --> 01:26:56,635
At this point,
at this point and the last one..

1252
01:26:56,799 --> 01:26:57,633
..would be at this point.

1253
01:26:59,766 --> 01:27:00,566
Here you are.

1254
01:27:05,899 --> 01:27:07,300
Yes. Yes. Do sign.

1255
01:27:10,265 --> 01:27:11,432
Suresh? - Hey!

1256
01:27:18,699 --> 01:27:19,800
Want to give your thumb print?

1257
01:27:21,833 --> 01:27:22,667
Rude man!

1258
01:27:26,866 --> 01:27:31,237
Suresh Singh. You are under
the oath of the late Thakur.

1259
01:27:32,499 --> 01:27:37,203
lf you are lying.. - Let
him go ahead and lie. Let him lie.

1260
01:27:38,466 --> 01:27:42,403
Hey.. - We will make him reach there.
To Thakur.

1261
01:27:43,399 --> 01:27:44,733
lf you have shame..

1262
01:27:44,799 --> 01:27:46,467
.. do go ahead and put your thumb
impression.. - No, no, don't do that.

1263
01:27:46,532 --> 01:27:47,666
Even l am standing here.

1264
01:27:48,399 --> 01:27:50,901
He_, he_, don't be scared. Don't be
scared. Put the impression. Come on.

1265
01:27:51,899 --> 01:27:52,833
Put the impression.

1266
01:27:53,632 --> 01:27:55,266
Can you see that, Pudhe sir?

1267
01:27:55,332 --> 01:27:57,233
He_, come on,
put the thumb impression. Come on.

1268
01:27:57,299 --> 01:28:01,603
He_, what is this..
- This land doesn't belong to me.

1269
01:28:02,666 --> 01:28:10,206
This land was given by his father
to his daughter called Shakuntala.

1270
01:28:10,632 --> 01:28:13,234
Hey, he is gone.. - Hey,
you told me that it is your land.

1271
01:28:13,399 --> 01:28:14,299
Brother.

1272
01:28:14,632 --> 01:28:16,300
Brother. - Someone stop him.

1273
01:28:20,799 --> 01:28:25,637
According to the situation and
the papers, l have no other choice.

1274
01:28:26,299 --> 01:28:27,299
What do you mean?

1275
01:28:27,499 --> 01:28:30,902
According to NOC, they are
the real owners of the property.

1276
01:28:31,332 --> 01:28:34,802
Yes. Actually my nephew
is the real owner of the land.

1277
01:28:35,265 --> 01:28:38,401
The land belonged to his mother. And
now he is the righflul owner of it.

1278
01:28:38,666 --> 01:28:40,834
Right, Dholu. Great.

1279
01:28:55,866 --> 01:28:56,833
Wm.

1280
01:28:58,566 --> 01:29:02,536
Our Gul seems a little
heavier on going to the city.

1281
01:29:03,199 --> 01:29:04,533
lt seems the water
of the city has suited her.

1282
01:29:04,799 --> 01:29:06,567
He_, blind man.

1283
01:29:06,766 --> 01:29:09,201
Not Gul but your brain has become fat.

1284
01:29:09,532 --> 01:29:10,866
He_, she is the same girl.

1285
01:29:41,199 --> 01:29:43,701
You have won the semi final.

1286
01:29:45,499 --> 01:29:47,701
But the grand finale is still left.

1287
01:29:48,733 --> 01:29:50,234
Grand finale.

1288
01:29:56,499 --> 01:29:57,466
What are you thinking of?

1289
01:30:01,432 --> 01:30:02,266
Till yesterday..

1290
01:30:03,299 --> 01:30:05,300
Till yesterday,
my village was my world.

1291
01:30:06,733 --> 01:30:11,604
And today, l am seeing
a completely different world.

1292
01:30:14,666 --> 01:30:18,136
You have made an unseen
dream turn into reality.

1293
01:30:19,499 --> 01:30:20,566
lt is just the beginning.

1294
01:30:21,799 --> 01:30:26,503
Nowyou will be vey famous in India.
Producers will run after you.

1295
01:30:27,466 --> 01:30:28,333
And they will give
you offers for films.

1296
01:30:28,532 --> 01:30:29,499
Really?

1297
01:30:30,466 --> 01:30:32,434
Bythe way, l have a lot
offun while shooting goes on.

1298
01:30:32,466 --> 01:30:35,168
l had seen a serial
shooting in Mendava.

1299
01:30:35,366 --> 01:30:38,235
ln that, the girl was telling
the hero about her heart.

1300
01:30:40,199 --> 01:30:42,000
Should l do it? - Yes.

1301
01:30:42,232 --> 01:30:43,066
You will rehearse as well.

1302
01:30:43,132 --> 01:30:45,067
''There is a dream.''

1303
01:30:45,132 --> 01:30:48,502
''To make you come into my tunes.''

1304
01:30:49,032 --> 01:30:55,138
''lt is my dream to sing with
you on the same musical note.''

1305
01:30:55,199 --> 01:30:56,233
''lt is my dream.''

1306
01:30:56,299 --> 01:30:58,134
My lips haven't yet..

1307
01:30:59,299 --> 01:31:00,333
Have not told you anything.

1308
01:31:01,399 --> 01:31:04,201
But don't my eyes say anything to you?

1309
01:31:04,265 --> 01:31:05,599
''My lover.''

1310
01:31:05,666 --> 01:31:09,169
When l run my fingers
through my hair..

1311
01:31:09,232 --> 01:31:12,201
''Even our breaths should
mingle with each other.''

1312
01:31:12,265 --> 01:31:14,734
lf you would have noticed carefully,
you would have known..

1313
01:31:16,432 --> 01:31:17,666
..that l keep on writing your name.

1314
01:31:17,733 --> 01:31:20,502
''All these moments.
All these moments.''

1315
01:31:20,566 --> 01:31:21,500
Did you..

1316
01:31:22,399 --> 01:31:24,400
Didn't you ever feel this love?

1317
01:31:29,299 --> 01:31:31,434
''ls this love? Tell me.''

1318
01:31:31,499 --> 01:31:33,067
Yes, l think..

1319
01:31:33,132 --> 01:31:34,933
''My heart is restless.''

1320
01:31:35,265 --> 01:31:36,366
l love you vey much.

1321
01:31:36,432 --> 01:31:41,370
''This is the color of love.
Is this love?''

1322
01:31:42,399 --> 01:31:43,433
Did you see that?

1323
01:31:44,065 --> 01:31:45,366
Even l can act so much.

1324
01:31:45,666 --> 01:31:47,601
We must talk to the
director about me as well.

1325
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,968
Nowyou wouldn't give me attention.

1326
01:31:51,232 --> 01:31:53,701
Yes. By the way, this is right.

1327
01:31:56,699 --> 01:32:02,604
''We shall sing the series
of musical notes all the time.''

1328
01:32:03,065 --> 01:32:05,934
By the way,
whatever l told you wasn't an act.

1329
01:32:07,632 --> 01:32:09,033
And even what l told
you wasn't an act.

1330
01:32:10,432 --> 01:32:11,466
Boy.

1331
01:32:18,332 --> 01:32:20,667
We will have the
engagement here in Mumbai.

1332
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,534
And the wedding will
take place in Rajasthan.

1333
01:32:24,666 --> 01:32:27,101
After the final program of Gul.

1334
01:32:27,499 --> 01:32:31,302
And l will come from the bride's side.

1335
01:32:34,265 --> 01:32:37,301
''The bubbles of water.''

1336
01:32:37,366 --> 01:32:39,000
''This night is saying..''

1337
01:32:39,065 --> 01:32:42,034
That is it.
We just need to find a good date.

1338
01:32:42,299 --> 01:32:43,600
Pandit.

lt is nice date. - Okay.

1342
01:32:48,599 --> 01:32:50,300
Engagement on the full moon night.

1343
01:32:51,299 --> 01:32:54,135
Come on, come on. Come here. Yes.

1344
01:32:54,532 --> 01:32:56,166
Be happy. Yes.

1345
01:33:01,532 --> 01:33:02,266
One minute.

1346
01:33:02,466 --> 01:33:03,433
What did l tell you?

1347
01:33:03,966 --> 01:33:04,866
Yes, Lal. Tell me.

1348
01:33:04,933 --> 01:33:06,968
How are you, my friend? My brother?

1349
01:33:07,065 --> 01:33:09,233
Get ready to listen to good news.

1350
01:33:09,499 --> 01:33:13,135
l have got an offer of _5
crores foryour plot from a party.

1351
01:33:13,199 --> 01:33:14,233
Yes, _5 crores.

1352
01:33:14,265 --> 01:33:17,468
But this time l want _OO/o commission.

1353
01:33:17,866 --> 01:33:21,002
And the party is coming to Mumbai
in a few days to finalise the deal.

1354
01:33:21,165 --> 01:33:22,966
You tell me.
Should l tell them to.. - Lal.

1355
01:33:23,933 --> 01:33:26,535
l will call you later.
Okay? - Hey, but..

1356
01:33:29,866 --> 01:33:32,001
What are you doing? l will get hurt.

1357
01:33:32,499 --> 01:33:35,134
He_, call those goons now.

1358
01:33:35,499 --> 01:33:37,200
The ones who were
recommended by Stanley.

1359
01:33:38,099 --> 01:33:39,934
l have called them, brother.
They are sitting outside.

1360
01:33:42,232 --> 01:33:45,401
Fool, even you will turn
me into a gangster like you.

1361
01:33:47,132 --> 01:33:50,068
And if this is what you want,
this is what you will get.

1362
01:33:51,966 --> 01:33:54,201
He_, but we lost
out on the land, right?

1363
01:33:54,366 --> 01:33:56,101
So what is the point
of calling those goons?

1364
01:33:57,499 --> 01:33:59,400
Have you forgotten Meirut?

1365
01:33:59,466 --> 01:34:01,000
What did they do in Meirut?

1366
01:34:01,232 --> 01:34:04,101
lf you lose from the law,
take control.

1367
01:34:05,332 --> 01:34:07,100
Take control of the land.

1368
01:34:10,265 --> 01:34:12,834
l hope no one among
you is a Rajasthani.

1369
01:34:19,399 --> 01:34:22,068
Oka_, brother.
Start their work from tomorrow.

1370
01:34:22,432 --> 01:34:24,033

Give them money.

1371

Oka_, brother.

He_, this fool. He has called
me again. He has called me again.

1373
01:34:29,866 --> 01:34:32,068
He doesn't spare me. Get lost.

1374
01:34:34,132 --> 01:34:37,969
Hello. Kuki. Kuki?

1375
01:34:38,466 --> 01:34:40,134

Hey, fool.

You had told me that you will
wait for me with a garland. Hey, fool.

1379

Where are you?
- Hey, you are a fool.. - Kuki?

1380
01:34:51,899 --> 01:34:53,267
Your father.. - Kuki.

Hey, did you understand what l said?

Eveyone must surround
the land and sit.

01:34:58,733 --> 01:35:00,267
No one must move from their place.

1384

No one.

1385
01:35:01,933 --> 01:35:04,135
Let there be storm, winds or rain.

1386
01:35:04,199 --> 01:35:05,934
Let there be the ultimate
natural calamity.

1387
01:35:06,099 --> 01:35:08,000
We must take the land in control.

1388

What happened?
Listen to me. l know you are a fool.

1400

You don't make mistakes.

1401
01:35:41,866 --> 01:35:43,934
But if you make any mistake today..

1402
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,000
..l will buy you alive, fool.

Even if half a mantra

Go home. - Brother Salim.

01:40:05,199 --> 01:40:08,669
Brother Salim.
That wasn't right on your part. No.

1496
01:40:09,232 --> 01:40:10,499
He_, stop.

Go by train and buy half a ticket.

When the TT asks why
did you buy half a ticket?

1503
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,901
Tell him that you are a kid.

1504
01:40:25,966 --> 01:40:28,168
Go, go away.
- Brother Salim. Brother Salim.

1505

Brother Salim.

01:41:11,699 --> 01:41:13,634
He is finally silent.

1513

You had a lot of demands, right?
A lot of demands.

1514
01:41:17,566 --> 01:41:18,767

What is it, brother? Even you want to
have fun? Spend your honeymoon well.

Give a check of two
Iakhs from me to the fool.

Quickly. He got a lot of
abuses from me. A lot ofthem.
