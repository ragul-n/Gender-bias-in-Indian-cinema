00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,430
This fair should be held in a wonderful way

3
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,000
This carnival
should be wonderful

4
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,750
- Hey, Merit - Reduce your
volume we are all standing here

5
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,750
Hey Policeman send him in!

6
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,250
What’s this?

7
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,250
This morning there was a small hindrance
Brought it along to floss my teeth

8
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Go brother! Drop these and go

9
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,750
Look at this
Ahead of me all our kith and kin are here

10
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,250
Are you fine?

11
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,250
Fall back!

12
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,620
You reached on time?

13
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,750
Shut up and sit

14
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,250
My dear well wisher

15
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,960
Look at this Rosamani Uncle! You have
come before. Won’t you invite me too!

16
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
This is mine, make sure no one touches it

17
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,100
We are starting work for the Temple fair

18
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,790
Suddenly, you don’t
want it to happen

19
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,810
You are insisting it to happen

20
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,340
You both arrive at a decision

21
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,620
To arrive at a decision or to devastate
something. This is no threat business

22
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,500
We are willing to give it in writing

23
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,020
that there will be no bloodshed
for them from our side

24
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,520
Calm down

25
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,520
Then what collector lord!

26
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:58,170
Is he some saint where
we inscribe his words?

27
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,180
They will say that the
scorpion stung the coconut

28
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,550
groove and the wolf
bantered the pal grooves

29
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,000
If you grant permission listening
to them

30
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,130
Here in our lake just like a blend of
vermilion you will see a bed of blood

31
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,360
None will know if its the
scarified goat’s blood

32
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,040
Or the human blood of
those whose tongue wags

33
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,520
That’s all I can say

34
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,020
(CHAOS)

35
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,250
I think Thookudurai is here

36
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,250
None of our men seated should get up

37
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,500
None should lower their attire in respect

38
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,520
None should get down

39
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,810
Greetings

40
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,270
Will this fair be conducted?

41
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,980
It will happen in a pompous way

42
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,560
Just as the wish of the
Almighty everyone will be fine

43
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,810
We are delighted

44
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,560
Greetings

45
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:32,810
Greetings

46
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:57,800
MR Thookudurain
In the neighboring villages he’s a bigwig

47
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,080
I told you all not to get up when he comes

48
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,860
You too are standing

49
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,560
Not just that, you even
adjusted your attire

50
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,060
Don’t pinpoint Keep quite

51
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,830
Respect, Fear and honor cannot be bought
It will come naturally

52
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,560
Once its there you can’t control or stop it

53
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,310
What's your say Thookudurai?

54
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:29,560
Collector Sir, you are a respected man
You know everything

55
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,810
But one thing

56
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,560
This Fair, unlike other places
Does not happen every year

57
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,560
It happens once in 10 years

58
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,560
Leaving behind the motherland, the
family and scattered all over

59
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:46,130
Suppering all the people
for the land and people

60
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,330
This is the day our wait
long to come back to

61
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:52,830
The earnestness of those who have left
and the anticipation of those waiting

62
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,450
Is what makes the
samplings flourish

63
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,020
Don’t say no

64
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,810
All those struggling to make ends meet

65
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,170
Its the day they wait for their
daughters to come with their

66
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,270
children. They wait for their
sons to bring new clothes

67
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,800
Its a day that marks a new chapter for them

68
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,300
Those who are separated by caste

69
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:15,310
Come together as a crowd
to prostrate to their God

70
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,800
Why! Even those who don’t believe in God

71
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,060
Come running this day to meet their people

72
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,560
Take a good decision

73
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,810
Let this Fair be conducted

74
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,810
Its not a game
What a serious matter this is..

75
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,810
They will call it the temple rituals

76
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,810
If that leads to chaos So many
lives will be lost in that

77
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,310
Want water?

78
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:45,790
- No

79
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,790
- Then the fair?
- Want it, say so

80
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,800
Tell it!

81
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,810
We want the fair to happen

82
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,720
Go start the preparations for the fair

83
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,270

They have included a name
that should not be included!

87
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,520
Brother!

88
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,770
Don’t give it to him

89
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,020
Merit!

90
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,270
He can never hear anything

91
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,520
Look at this

92
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,630
The invite is heavy I will hold it

93
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:45,740
- Move your finger uncle - If I move my finger
you will remove the hand of the printer

94
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,810
Move your finger

95
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,890
(MRS NIRANJANA THOOKUDURAI)

96
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,270
We will call back all the invitations

97
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,080
and erase it will permanent ink

98
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,050
They have put her name

99
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,560
Let it be there for namesake

100
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,990
Come as husband and wife and do the rituals

101
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,660
Listen Grandma

102
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,520
You are a senior member
who should guide everyone

103
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,020
Can you cry on an auspicious day

104
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,680
At a time when you should be
happy why are you mourning

105
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,520
Ask her why?

106
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,000
Are you happy my dear?

107
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,100
Have you ever seen me without a smile?

108
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:29,770
There’s always a smile,
but is there happiness?

109
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:40,770
I am old enough to know the difference
between a smile and happiness

110
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,770
Brother! All of them are happy and
rejoicing with their families

111
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,020
You are standing alone

112
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,620
Even if the entire village
is standing under the shade

113
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,790
of the Banayan tree, it
is standing under the sun

114
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,520
You want everyone to be happy

115
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,520
For your welfare can we go
and call your wife once

116
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:11,520
When you are in grief how
can we celebrate here?

117
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:14,010
We don’t want this fair

118
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,020
Lets go and bring her back

119
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,520
Please go

120
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:21,270
10 years back, you both hoisted
the pole here for the fair

121
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,880
That sight is still fresh for me

122
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:28,770
My heart yearns
to see that again

123
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,520
Please agree

124
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,770
For the sake of the girl,
why don’t you compromise

125
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:39,020
History never shows that a man who
compromises with wife being defeated

126
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:43,770
I don’t know if I will be
alive for the next fair

127
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,260
I want to see you both being
happy before I depart

128
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,020
Please agree my dear

129
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,020
Please bring her back

130
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,270
Why are you standing alone?

131
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:15,770
I am enjoying the rain

132
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,020
There’s a storm within and
you claim to enjoy the rain

133
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,250
I am fine

134
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,500
Are you telling me about yourself?

135
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:29,250
How were you 10
to 12 years back?

136
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,020
Thookudurai means unstoppable

137
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:38,270
Thookuduari means a riot

138
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:43,020
Thookuduari means a rage

139
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:48,520
Thookudurai means a fearless tornado

154
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,820
In front of others, We never bend
down, We are never from that group

155
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:17,310
You spring into prosperity
We never try to hide and leap

156
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:23,310
We walk fearless with our sword
and say there’s no enmity

00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,520
From the time you got
in you’re talking to me

178
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,270
I don’t know whom to choose from these 3

179
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:22,770
Before the camp is over
one should be pregnant

180
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,250
What?

181
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,900
Did you hear what I
spoke within my heart?

182
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,890
Yes

183
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,920
- Did you understand?
- No

184
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,640
Then there’s no issue!

185
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,250
Doctor I have sought help
for you from one person

186
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:37,270
You can have your camp at his place
You can stay at his place

187
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:40,740
Because he won’t listen to what I say. But
the entire village will listen to him

188
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:44,020
We both are so close!
He’s coming right in front of us

189
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:48,520
Look at him he’s so calm
and coming all alone

190
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,270
Stop the van
We will finish the work on the way

191
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:54,270
Hi!

192
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,150
Why are they all running?

193
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,020
I guessed it

194
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,100
What's wrong?

195
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:18,270
Why are you hitting these kids?

196
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,470
Why are you hitting them?
Aren’t they going for tuition?

197
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,770
Will you brew illicit liquor?

198
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,020
It hurts?

199
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,770
He’s crying and you are
asking him if it hurts?

200
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,840
What did you guys do?
- Will you brew illicit liquor?

201
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,510
Will you brew illicit liquor?

202
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:51,810
He does not like illicit liquor?

203
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,060
Just shut your crooked mouth and sit

204
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,560
Who said?

205
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,310
I really like liquor

206
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,580
Whenever I come drunk

207
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,250
My grandma would say-

208
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,700
my dear! Don’t sleep on an
empty stomach after drinking

209
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,310
Eat something and sleep
was what she used to say!

210
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:15,540
In the year 1998 on March 12th

211
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:19,030
around 8 in the night

212
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:21,810
My grandma looked at me and said

213
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,810
How did she say!

214
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:30,810
My dear Thookudurai for how long
are you going to drink like this

215
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,310
She told me not to drink hereafter

216
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:36,810
That day I decided

217
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,810
Hereafter I should not drink

218
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,780
From morning to evening you are
hitting them Your hands will hurt

219
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:42,810
Your hands will hurt

220
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,590
The liquor that I don’t drink
None should drink or brew it

221
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:52,830
in the neighboring 12 village
was the rule that I put out

222
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:58,180
You are disobeying the rules laid

223
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:00,060
Get lost

224
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,810
Let him in!

225
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:12,040
I am the grandson of Nallamuthu
I am coming to triumph

226
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,570
Have something to eat and play

227
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,310
Hold his legs

228
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:32,300
Go throw him away!

229
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:36,130
Here we've lifted him

230
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,810
Thookudurai!
- About what?

231
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,560
Its about you

232
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:44,060
Tell it PC!

233
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,430
There’s a case lodged
against you at the station

234
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,000
What!

235
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,520
Really! Case?

236
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
(CHAOS SHOUTING)

237
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:18,520
Who is that person who doesn’t fear
death that gave a case against me?

238
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:21,010
First sit then we will have tea

239
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,020
First sit, then we will talk

240
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:27,560
who gave a case against him?

241
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,120
I gave the complaint

242
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,620
So what?

243
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,000
A lady?

244
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,490
We are doctors
We have come from Mumbai

245
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,840
We are going to conduct a
medical camp in your place

246
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:45,990
Come her for treatment?

247
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,300

248
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,800
Arrest him immediately

249
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,300
Is there a witness?

250
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,310
Witness?

251
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,300
Witness, right?

252
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,800
I have it filmed

253
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,300
In 30 years how many fights
we would have got into?

254
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,300
To track that it will take us 3 years

255
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:22,300
So many of them have told that
I hit with style

256
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,800
- Till now
- Till now?

257
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,300
Your smile is beautiful

258
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,800
I have never seen the way I fought

259
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,300
But today The way I hit the hips

260
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,300
The way I smashed the jaws
The way I broke the teeth

261
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,360
All this was captured well
By this girl

262
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:54,790
Movie over!
- Movie is over calm down!

263
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:58,690
Give it in our local channel
Caption it as Trashing Knight Thookudurai

264
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,540
It will set the cash registers ringing

265
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,170
Let someone live because of us!

266
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,030
- Don’t get into politics - No no
I have happy with my petty shop

267
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:12,510
Inspector what’s this? They are enjoying
the evidence and you are keeping quite

268
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,300
They are in group discussion
it will be a good decision

269
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,690
Tomorrow morning there a
knockout on the Northern region

270
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,080
By mid day its a clash
in the central region

271
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:30,110
Evening its a riot on the eastern region

272
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:33,830
There are many thugs to be thrashed

273
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,910
But we don’t have a person
to capture all this

274
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,340
So we have decided to
hire you for that work

275
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:43,820
- 3 meals a day - RS 3500 ways - A
shed to stay - A fan to keep you cool

276
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,580

skills he will increase your salary

277
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,330
Say yes or YES!

278
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,840
Inspector What’s this atrocity?

279
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,340
No its not a city

280
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:58,080
It’s a small village Kodivelarpatti

281
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:03,580
Irrespective of all the threats You came
forward to give a complaint against me

282
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:08,080
A girl should be brave like this

283
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:12,840
Tell her that I like her in English!

284
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:16,830
I like you

285
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,090
Tell her with respect

286
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:21,570
Its the same “YOU” in English

287
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,320
It’s such a disrespectful language

288
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,340
Good that I didn’t learn it

289
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:31,330
I came behind bars not fearing the case

290
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:34,340
Its for the fearless act of yours

291
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:39,330
Doctor, you are top tucker

292
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,860
What a quote!

293
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,340
Avudaiappan is here, I wouldn't
have come if I knew this

294
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:52,330
(SHOUTING TO CLEAR THE PLACE)

295
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,330
Whose father’s place is this
that you have put a tent on!

296
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,340
Who are you? Why are you
fighting unnecessarily

297
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:05,090
Where am I?

298
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:08,330
1 minute of his anger

299
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,830
Made me unconscious for 5 hours

300
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,830
What’s the noise there?

301
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,080
Clear it!

302
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,660
We have Government permission
- Do you have my permission?

303
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,570
You better pay me RS 5
lakhs, Else in none of

304
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,370
the neighboring villages
can you do anything

305
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:26,090
This police, commissioner, Tasildar
none will come to your rescue

306
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:28,090
This leader will come

307
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:33,090
You coming to stop something good in this

308
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:37,090
and once I tell you under
whose leadership it happens

309
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,840
Doctors, don’t worry

310
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:43,830
Now I am going to utter a name, He’s going
to be shocked, You’re all going to laugh

311
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,870
Do you know under whose leadership
this camp is being conducted?

312
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:49,900
Who?

313
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,340
Thookudurai

314
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:56,580
What’s this the reaction are reversed!

315
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,430
You statue come here

316
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:03,580
The Thookudurai you mentioned - I mentioned
- Madam has put him in jail

317
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,080
Put him in jail

318
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:12,380
The first task that he does after he comes
out from jail, Will be to crucify me

319
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:19,090
I give you one hour to give me 5 lakhs

320
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:23,080
Else will remove all the camps from here

321
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:25,370
Can we give that 5 lakhs?

322
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:27,900
We have sought proper permissions
We don’t need to pay anyone

323
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,320
We will go to some other place

324
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,910
The medical camp will happen here

325
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,590
We don't have to fear

326
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,090
Then whats the way out
- There’s just one way

327
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:38,750
The man you put behind bars, bring him out
on bail Just ask a small sorry to him

328
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:41,840
Then seek help from him
He will definitely do it

329
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:45,340
Then why will this pest come around

330
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:49,090
Then this guy is bad and
Thookudurai is good?

331
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:53,590
Thookudurai is also bad
But this guy is rotten bad guy

332
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,050
Thookudurai is a righteous bad guy

333
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,590
Mam lets get him out on bail
- Joker!

334
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,340
Yeah maam

335
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:08,340
Joker!

336
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,840
Why are you dropping the joker!

337
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:12,590
For almost 2 days I am winning

338
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,090
I suspect that you guys are cheating

339
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:18,590
Then what! With others
to win we need to cheat

340
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:22,330
With you, to loose
we need to cheat

341
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:25,840
If we win you, you will trash us like this

342
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:28,590
Yes! I will trash right!

343
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:32,600
Whatever be the reason
don’t look into his eyes

344
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:34,100
No eye contact

345
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,620
What if we contact

346
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,580
Then I will need to contact
all your relatives

347
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:46,410
What’s this! The police station
looks like a marriage hall

348
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:50,840
Oh my! Thookudurai why are you counting
the bars You don’t even know maths!

349
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,100
Don’t hit me

350
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,840
Wait! Wait!

351
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:02,590
Why I was unconscious all this happened

352
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,710
When I regained consciousness
I erupted like a volcano

353
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,340
I dragged the doctors here

354
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:10,230
That lady doctor will fall at
your feet and withdraw the case

355
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,590
You will need to do another small favor

356
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:17,570
You withdrawing the case is not
for Thookudurai. Its for us

357
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:24,090
Its not like he was arrested Its like he
arrested the station and kept it in this place

358
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,090
Sign it!

359
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:28,090
She came forward to sign

360
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:29,840
The case is withdrawn

361
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,590
Next she will fall at
your feet and seek pardon

362
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,530
Compulsory crying

363
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:38,050
In that tears you will jump and play

364
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:46,430
Where are you going?

365
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:51,800
Where are you going? You said you
will plead and now you are passing by

366
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,620
If you don’t seek pardon, they
will beat the pulp out of me

367
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,520
If we don’t understand
someone its not a mistake

368
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,310
But if we misunderstand
that’s a big mistake

369
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:00,780
I have withdrawn the case

370
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:04,550
I can’t plead and seek help from him

371
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,550
You can't?

372
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:19,900
Can you sum up this incident
in one word in English?

373
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:21,550
Unbelievable!

374
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:24,050
Its like that

375
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:26,070
English

376
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:30,600
You don’t have 5 lakhs
Break everything

377
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:37,090
What are you doing?

378
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,590
You are here?

379
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,830
I was asking if you are here only!

380
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,340
I was searching elsewhere

381
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:56,090
Durai is here, come

382
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,840
What’s this! Creating some confusion?

383
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:04,590
Nothing for the last couple of days was
unwell Cough cold, so came to see the doctor

384
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:09,590
All 45 don’t cough together
It won’t be believable

385
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:13,340
I believe you All the damaged
things should be put in the vehicle

386
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:19,820
Don’t worry, you can stay at my place

387
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:23,110
You can run your camp in my rice
mill I will supply the patients

388
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:25,090
The camp will be fantastic

389
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,590
I offer help without a thought

390
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,840
You are thinking to seek help

391
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:35,340
Hey kids

392
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,090
These are our village kids
They want to be doctors

393
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:42,590
Till the end of the camp keep them
with you. They will learn something

394
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:48,370
Don't think! A help for a help,
NO strain the relationship

395
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,830
Will you accept us?

396
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:12,550
The beauty who drags the paddy
Drags your heart with it

397
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:15,800
The beauty who drags the paddy
Drags your heart with it

398
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:21,550
There’s no one around
You come her in all shyness my dear

399
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:25,800
You come her in all shyness my dear

400
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:42,800
My dark lovely
The one who filled my hands with bangles

401
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:49,050
The bloom has set in
But your charm won’t work here my dear

402
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:52,550
But your charm won’t work here my dear

403
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:07,310
In the coveted farm
In the motor room

404
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:11,530
In the coveted farm
In the motor room

405
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,240
I will come like a tide

406
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:20,800
You come to ride the ship my dear

407
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,820
It was bleeding

408
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,070
and I rushed him here

409
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:44,070
Priya bring that injection
- Injection!

410
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:49,320
Nothing, Don’t panic,
it will be a pinprick

411
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:52,820
He’s afraid of injections

412
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,760
First you give me one
Looking at it his fear will vanish

413
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:03,680
No need doctor
It will hurt doctor

414
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:06,820
You don’t fear the sickle but
you fear this tiny injection

415
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,820
It will for the brave

416
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:14,070
When attacked by the sickle it will
only trigger strength not fear

417
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:17,690
I don’t know that he was going to hit

418
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,990
But I know that you are going to inject

419
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:24,050
I am using your name to
scare the entire village

420
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,700
If they know that you fear
an injection how will it be?

421
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,530
What should I do?

422
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:30,220
You sing aloud. In that gap will
ask her to give the injection

423
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:33,300
Me?
- Sing please

424
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:41,800
(TRYING TO SING)

425
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:49,800
What’s this I am feeling drowsy?

426
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:53,050
I gave a sedative to ease you off the pain

427
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:55,050
Sedative? Wont you tell us

428
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:58,050
I am getting high

429
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:01,800
Its 6 years since you had liquor
That doctor girl has given you sedatives

430
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,620
Don’t know what’s going to happen

431
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:06,550
Whatever happens, don’t leave my hand

432
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:08,060
I won’t leave your hand

433
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:11,050
Hey! Hold me tight

434
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:15,870
Uncle make sure I don’t cross my limit

435
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:21,820
Thookudurai, Don’t look at the place
that I am suturing, it will disturb you

436
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:23,570
Look at me

437
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:25,340
Look at my eyes

438
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,340
I think he will have a flow!

439
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:48,400
What?
- A secret

440
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:51,570
Doctor’s eyes

441
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:58,340
Its not eyes. Its looks as cool as the
beautiful pulp that cut from the palm fruit

442
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,090
He caught me by the chain

443
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,840
- Where are you going?
- No where

444
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:11,080
A secret to you
- me too?

445
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:16,590
Doctor’s nose, Its not a nose its
the sweetshop special cashew cake

446
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:21,680
Doctor’s face!

447
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:24,090
Its not a face

448
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:29,590
Its like the milk delicacy of our grandma

449
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:39,090
It all doctor is a
Coat wearing wheat halwa

450
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:41,090
Halwa?

451
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,600
Stitching is over, take him carefully

452
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:49,720
Thank goodness I had so
many thoughts in my heart

453
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,090
Somehow I managed

454
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:55,340
to curb my thoughts and have control

455
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,840
Full control

456
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,680
All that you should not
say, you scream it aloud

457
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,110
and now the whispers

458
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:05,590
- Darling, I was silent
- A massive silence

459
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:13,780
(LULLABY)

460
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,010
I am not in sync with the situation

461
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,770
Its getting late let’s leave

462
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:22,030
Doctor is coming and you want to leave

463
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,780
Doctor will come Let’s leave

464
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,530
Doctor is a guest to our house
We will eat with her

465
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:33,530
You have decided

466
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:36,530
Doctor, Greetings Can we eat?

467
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:43,510
What injection did you give yesterday?

468
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,780
I slept like a child

469
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,280
I felt like someone touched my stitches

470
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:53,030
My brother loves the cashew
cake from special sweetshop

471
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,280
I know
- How do you know?

472
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:56,550
I heard about it

473
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,300
Look!

474
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,050
This milk delicacy is a special dish here

475
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,020
You should never have it just like that

476
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:06,050
You should scoop it
with the sugar syrup

477
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,340
Let’s leave

478
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:10,090
We should teach her to eat

479
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,590
He loves this milk delicacy

480
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:15,710
I know that as well

481
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,040
How do you know this?
Heard about it

482
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:21,340
Even the doctor who came in yesterday
knows everything that I like

483
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:25,090
You don’t know anything Uncle - Only
yesterday I knew that you like Doctor

484
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:29,220
When you were given the
injections, your thoughts

485
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:32,450
were boundless You blabbered
everything unfiltered

486
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:35,820
I told you to watch me
from crossing my limits

487
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:39,090
I held your hands, feet and
could not hold your mouth

488
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:41,750
There’s so much work and you
are sitting here and eating

489
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,070
My love!

490
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:47,350
You know what I have got for you?

491
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:54,590
Thookudurai
- Thookudurai really likes Wheat Halwa

492
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,950
Fine?
Can I go?

493
00:37:57,350 --> 00:38:00,850
He can’t stay hungry for long
Just eat a mouthful please

494
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:03,090
Just one!

495
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:13,590
What’s this? Looks like the load is higher

496
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,100
Just 50 bags extra

497
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:18,340
No one can find out

498
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:24,060
To stay honest is not for others.
Its for us

499
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:27,210
Will make an effort
- Effort is life

500
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,060
Doctor!

501
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:36,550
Don’t simply stare

502
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:39,490
Yesterday I was high and told the
truth that you are beautiful

503
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:43,330
If you continue to stare
will lie that you are ugly

504
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:44,690
No, I didn't look

505
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:49,070
She was looking at
you and we saw that

506
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:53,040
As a child among children I also saw that

507
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:55,070
Innocent kids

508
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:58,320
Kids and the almighty are the same

509
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,820
Will children lie

510
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:02,070
No I didn’t see

511
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:04,820
Child what’s you name?
- Meiazahagai

512
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,820
Will she lie?
- No

513
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:09,570
Come will buy you all a chocolate
- I need one too

514
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,880
Thinning of you for slips seconds
Churns a storm in my heart

515
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:29,340
It creates a swirl As
you speak with your eyes

516
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:45,320
My head spins thinking of you, I leaves
a chill in me, As I think of you

517
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:56,320
Guava!
Guava!

518
00:39:57,070 --> 00:40:00,570
I was about to peck you thinking
you were my guava fruit

519
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:04,090
I shun the sweet mango wanting
to dunk in your sweetness

520
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:16,180
Thinking you were the pot of water
I wanted to quench my thirst

521
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:19,590
Thinking you were the value
pole I choose to throw you away

522
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:31,380
Thinking you were the banyan
tree I came as the small deity

523
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:34,570
I stood with wounds the wind

524
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,790
Thinking you wear the grinding stone,
I came as a piece of the coconut

525
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:42,350
Thinking you were the mortar
stone, I can as the batter

526
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:57,820
Thinking you are the cash register
I came to fill it with coins

527
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:01,820
Knowing that you are gold mine
I stood in disbelief

528
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:17,070
Waiting for the wedding bells my dear Come
with the sacred thread and take me my dear

529
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:49,570
About 4 mosquitoes have
gone into your mouth

530
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:04,590
Get 50 people ready at 5.30

531
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:13,790
Why are you strangling me

532
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:21,780
Thookudurai, did you stare at me?

533
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:32,360
Uncle, we all saw you were looking at her.
Get us 5 Rupees chocolate

534
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:35,820
Are you all kids or imps!

535
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,080
They are lying Doctor

536
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:39,570
You are lying

537
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:43,070
Tell Doctor that I did
not see in English

538
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,810
That won’t be necessary
- She believed

539
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,730
Our deity who protects all the people here

540
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,000
Forgive our sins and protect us

541
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Pray well, all that you
wish for will come true

542
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:00,520
Bless us in abundance and
make this place fertile

543
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,520
Yearly once we give offerings
and pray to our God

544
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:05,760
So many of you are here

545
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:07,260
All are our relatives

546
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:10,840
All these are not just
relatives they are our blood

547
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:14,400
How can so many of blood relatives be there

548
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:15,810
How can you ask like that?

549
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:18,770
For all of them he had shed
his blood when in distress

550
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,270
and how can they not be his relatives

551
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:24,020
Take the blessings

552
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:39,510
Go and wear

553
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:41,270
Saree and come

554
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:44,020
Hold it!

555
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,000
Imthialy

556
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:05,140
What’s it for beautiful in English?

557
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:10,010
For Splendid
- Many beautiful

558
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,770
May beauty

559
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:17,870
You look beautiful

560
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,270
Lets go out

561
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:24,290
- It's a food stall
- Yeah

562
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:27,770
I think its going to rain
inside the house. Lets go out

563
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:31,270
I have seen you be angry and happy.
Never have seen you be confused. Relax.

564
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:34,270
Brother!

565
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:36,530
Doctor looks so beautiful

566
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:39,760
How about me?

567
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:54,230
No one called you two go see

568
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:57,730
You said no one called

569
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:01,730
There are two types of people
One group listens to the brain and work

570
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:03,790
The other listens to the heart and work

571
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:07,210
When I was in third grade they knocked
my head and told me that I have no brain

572
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:09,730
So I always follow my heart and work

573
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:13,730
For the first time I want
to tell you something

574
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:16,230
My brain is waking up and interrupting

575
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:17,730
Then I thought,

576
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:19,230
what will happen

577
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:22,800
That's why I wanted to tell it

578
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,210
What are you going to say?

579
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:27,730
In a sari

580
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:30,230
You

581
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:33,590
Look fabulous

582
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:41,960
Intelligence

583
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,240
talent

584
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:44,730
Courage

585
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:48,310
combined with all this you
are extremely beautiful

586
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:51,230
Name beauty

587
00:45:58,730 --> 00:45:59,730
Watch your steps

588
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:04,220
You both were looking at each other

589
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:06,830
We saw that

590
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:13,730
Will you buy us 5 Rupees chocolate

591
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:16,730
Will buy 10 rupees chocolate

592
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:30,230
Play it loud

593
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:34,730
Louder!

594
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:37,730
You were born and raised in Mumbai

595
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:41,230
I was born here in Theni
There is no destiny for us to meet

596
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:42,610
But we somehow met

597
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:44,990
If we will meet again I don’t
think there is a chance

598
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:48,230
So long live, happy life

599
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:50,230
Correct!

600
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:53,230
When its your marriage send us an invite
We will all come

601
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:57,230
Also when its his marriage we
will send you an invitation

602
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:58,750
You all should come

603
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:03,230
Get going

604
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:05,230
Why are they not moving the train

605
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:08,720
Only If I go can we depart - Who is he?
- He’s the engine driver

606
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:12,730
Give way, We have our kith and kin.
Make sure you don’t drive on bumps

607
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:16,730
Stop on the way at a hotel place to eat

608
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:25,230
Should you drive so fast inside the house

609
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:29,220
Who is this

610
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:31,730
who has parked the vehicle
across the house?

611
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:33,230
Its Doctor’s vehicle

612
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:36,490
Doctor! Dust

613
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:45,730
They have some with gifts and flowers.
What could it be

614
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:49,730
We told them to tell us when her
marriage is fixed Its probably that

615
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:52,730
Doctor when did you come?

616
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:54,730
He’s MR Thookudurai

617
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:58,230
My father wanted to talk to you

618
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,230
My daughter wishes to marry you

619
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:05,730
Fantastic!
Doctor is getting married

620
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:10,230
Look her, Its raining.
Its very auspicious

621
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:12,730
We all will be there before two days

622
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:14,590
We will stay in front and
conduct the marriage

623
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:18,170
From the time we print the
invites till the time we

624
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:21,250
serve dinner We will be on
our toes and do everything

625
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:23,230
What Uncle!

626
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:27,730
If the groom’s side they
come with any complaints

627
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:31,720
He will be dead

628
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:37,630
When asked give an answer

629
00:48:38,730 --> 00:48:40,230
You are staring like an owl

630
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:43,730
Her father said something in English
Ask him to repeat it

631
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:47,410
Sir, you said something in English
Can you say it again

632
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:50,230
My daughter wants to get married to you

633
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:52,750
Doctor, marry, its doctor’s marriage

634
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:56,300
It’s doctor’s marriage
Ask him who is the groom

635
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:59,250
Who is the groom?
- You

636
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,950
All our ancestors, our deities You
have shown a good path for him

637
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:08,770
If my daughter takes a
decision she won’t change it

638
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,000
We will talk alone
- Sure

639
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,500
If you go to rear in the rain then

640
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,520
The life would be barren

641
00:49:44,270 --> 00:49:48,020
How will I suit you?

642
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:51,030
You are here and I am here

643
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,020
Not just a ladder even an
airplane cannot bride the gap

644
00:49:55,930 --> 00:49:57,930
You are educated

645
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:00,710
Studying few books is not difficult

646
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:04,460
You need to understand the people and
the soil That way you are also educated

647
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,730
He is educated

648
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:07,480
I'm gone

649
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,480
You are a doctor

650
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,980
You own a rice mill

651
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:14,980
- Uncle
- You go ahead

652
00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:17,870
You are beautiful

653
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:21,230
You are also beautiful

654
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:24,200
Who is more beautiful than my
grandson in the neighboring towns

655
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,980
Grandma!

656
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:29,230
Doctor, something has gone wrong for you

657
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:31,060
You know all the medicines

658
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:35,980
Have two yellow pills and two white pills
Sleep well And leave tomorrow morning

659
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:38,820
Thookudurai
- That’s me

660
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:42,230
I have traveled to all the places
I have seen all the wealth

661
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:45,480
I thought I have everything

662
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:48,480
But after I stayed with you all

663
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:50,230
After seeing your relatives

664
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:52,980
I realized how much I have lost

665
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:58,280
In my life everything has a system
There’s a calculation for everything

666
00:50:58,450 --> 00:51:00,070
I thought winning will bring
happiness and I will win

667
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:02,180
I thought studying will bring
happiness and I studied

668
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:05,720
I am running in search of something
that will give me happiness

669
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,930
Here when I saw,

670
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:12,230
happiness is filled within
you and your village

671
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:16,000
I want to grab it with both my hands

672
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,720
When you came to our place
There was anger in you

673
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,480
I am a person with anger so were you

674
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:24,730
We united because of anger

675
00:51:25,230 --> 00:51:26,980
Now you are subdued

676
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:28,480
How will that match?

677
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:31,030
For all girls anger is a shield

678
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:34,490
They are angry so that someone
does not go near them

679
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:36,480
I was also like that

680
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:40,770
But as I interacted with you and
your people There was no fear in me

681
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:43,600
So I didn’t need the shield of anger

682
00:51:45,490 --> 00:51:50,230
When I am with you I am happy
and protected

683
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,650
I feel safe

684
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:53,780
Have you decided?

685
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:58,480
I have decided. If you don’t like me.
You can say that you dislike me

686
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:01,480
Dislike? His heart is racing

687
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:03,900
He heard it

688
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:06,480
You don’t like me?

689
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:08,980
I can’t lie coherently

690
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:12,230
Then tell the truth

691
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,480
Welcome!

692
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:37,220
Share it among yourself!

693
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:39,730
All these snacks are for you

694
00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:55,000
What will have to eat please?

695
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Many you hold 80% of our company share

696
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:11,250
If you part with 40% we can scale higher

697
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:15,070
They say with heights you will be alone

698
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:19,750
But according to me I am at
heights only because I am alone

699
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:32,730
It would take time

700
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:35,730
Sir it will take very long time

701
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,980
Even if its evening its fine

702
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:42,980
Should I come tomorrow?
- Sir, Madam is not in town

703
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:45,950
Endless sky I am your cloud

704
00:54:54,480 --> 00:55:02,480
Endless sky I am your cloud

705
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:09,980
In front of me, In front
of my eyes, I need you

706
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:15,970
In this soil, I need
to be in front of you

707
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:21,480
The love that cannot be expressed. The
care that finds no limits to express

708
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:26,480
The joy that cannot be
counted, Is there within you

709
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:31,100
You are my wife

710
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:36,730
I am your equal half

711
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:41,720
You are my wife

712
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:47,980
I am your equal half

713
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:53,480
Endless sky

714
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:59,980
I am your cloud

715
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:30,250
This is not working
Its totally not working

716
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:34,520
Niranjana, When I am angry
at work Don’t walk in between

717
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:36,770
My heart ponders and I become mushy

718
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:41,020
When I give you my hand,
it’s like hugging you tight

719
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:44,270
But you are always surrounded by 10 people

720
00:56:44,770 --> 00:56:46,770
That’s why I have an idea

721
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:50,520
Whenever I feel like hugging you

722
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:54,020
Then I will give you a hand

723
00:56:55,170 --> 00:56:57,920
When I give you my hand,
it’s like hugging you tight

724
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:01,270
You feel like that now?

725
00:57:02,270 --> 00:57:05,020
Educated girl!
Doing all crazy stuff

726
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:06,520
gets me tipsy

727
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:13,520
Dad, at Stanford University my
Doctorate thesis has been validated

728
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:17,770
They have invited me to come there
for a residency program for 6 months

729
00:57:18,270 --> 00:57:19,270
Very glad

730
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:21,780
A delightful news
- Happy news!

731
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:23,660
You come in person will tell you

732
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:25,020
Will come now

733
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:55,520
Nirnajana Whats the happy news?

734
00:57:56,270 --> 00:57:57,270
Tell!

735
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:00,780
What happened?

736
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:44,080
My sweetheart, In your nectar
like an ant drenched in sweetness

737
00:58:44,110 --> 00:58:48,910
I am drenched,
I don’t want to move away

738
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:54,790
I forgot all that I was from
my birth from the time

739
00:58:54,820 --> 00:59:00,440
I am with you. There’s nothing other
than your face that I can see

740
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:06,410
No one has lived this glorious life

741
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:10,910
Thinking of it
Fills my heart with rain showers

742
00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:16,160
The scent of the infant is sufficient
To bring the clouds to our heads

743
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:21,910
If I part from you once
My life is no longer with me

744
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:26,920
You are my wife

745
00:59:27,910 --> 00:59:32,910
I am your equal half

746
00:59:34,410 --> 00:59:42,410
Endless sky I am your cloud

747
00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:50,410
In front of me, In front
of my eyes, I need you

748
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:55,660
In this soil, I need
to be in front of you

749
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:00,910
The love that cannot be expressed. The
care that finds no limits to express

750
01:00:01,910 --> 01:00:06,410
The joy that cannot be counted.
Is there within you

751
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:10,660
You are my wife

752
01:00:12,170 --> 01:00:16,910
I am your equal half

753
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:21,410
You are my wife

754
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:28,160
I am your equal half

755
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:55,120
- Take care of her carefully
- Don’t worry

756
01:00:55,870 --> 01:00:56,870
I will take care of her

757
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:58,870
You will take care of carefully right?

758
01:00:58,890 --> 01:01:01,140
I told you I will take care

759
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:03,910
Say bye to you mother

760
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:06,870
Have a safe trip

761
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:21,460
Baby you should not cry

762
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:24,100
Grandpa is here with you
It’s Niranjana

763
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:26,960
In about half and hour
I will reach our place

764
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:28,910
You will come to the station
to pick me up isn’t it?

765
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:31,440
We are coming to the railway station

766
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:38,980
Who is the one that's blocking the path?

767
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:47,980
All of you come

768
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:49,480
Round him up

769
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:52,980
Don’t spare him

770
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:54,860
Slash him to pieces

771
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:58,480
Have you come here to make an incident?

772
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:01,980
The child is here, will
send her with my uncle

773
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,980
Let’s stay as long as you
want and sort this out

774
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:08,470
What’s this? You’re talking

775
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:10,540
Usually by this time you are in action!

776
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:13,480
So the situation is
not in favor for you

777
01:02:15,830 --> 01:02:18,840
Will be get a golden opportunity

778
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:34,480
My hands!

779
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:39,480
Give her to me!

780
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:13,460
Just slash him!

781
01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:34,760
Is this how you come to the station?

782
01:03:35,110 --> 01:03:37,860
On the way
- Is she drenched?

783
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:41,230
I was constantly thinking about her

784
01:03:44,350 --> 01:03:46,250
Why is her neck not steady?
- She’s asleep

785
01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:52,230
Nothing to worry, she’s sleeping

786
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
What’s this blood stain?

787
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:57,760
What happened to you?
- Nothing

788
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:04,020
No! She’s bleeding near the neck

789
01:04:05,010 --> 01:04:06,520
What happened to her?

790
01:04:07,270 --> 01:04:09,040
During the fight did the
sickle hurt the child?

791
01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:11,320
See what’s happening?

792
01:04:12,270 --> 01:04:15,520
Need to take her to the hospital

793
01:04:28,770 --> 01:04:31,510
Niranjana, under this situation
you can’t handle the treatment

794
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:39,850
My Lord!

795
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:59,320
What actually happened was..

796
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:05,020
Because of you, my child is hurt
She’s battling for her life

797
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:08,520
That’s what actually happened

798
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:12,760
What else should happen?

799
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:14,520
What should happen?

800
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:21,520
My child

801
01:05:28,270 --> 01:05:31,260
It’s all because of you

802
01:05:33,510 --> 01:05:37,020
As a mother, I understand your pain

803
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:42,770
Just as you suffer in pain, As a
father I also go through the same pain

804
01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:49,270
You should not suffer in pain

805
01:05:49,770 --> 01:05:51,260
You should suffer in guilt

806
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:55,070
I told you not to take the child
for these fights and quarrels

807
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:58,270
No Niranjana, it was not
during any mediation

808
01:05:58,770 --> 01:06:00,020
It was totally unexpected

809
01:06:00,270 --> 01:06:01,520
You have 300 relatives,

810
01:06:02,190 --> 01:06:03,440
they have thousands of problems

811
01:06:04,010 --> 01:06:05,520
You will go and fight for them

812
01:06:06,050 --> 01:06:08,310
You anticipate death anytime

813
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:10,460
and you are used to it

814
01:06:10,570 --> 01:06:11,820
I am trembling in shock

815
01:06:12,770 --> 01:06:14,270
It will never happen again

816
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:16,010
Trust me

817
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:18,650
If I trust you again and
something happens to me

818
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:22,010
I know that its my destiny that I lost
my life for the reason I loved you

819
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,980
She’s an infant

820
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:28,220
Should she die without knowing
the reason for her death

821
01:06:29,770 --> 01:06:32,520
You knew who I was and choose to marry me

822
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:34,820
I didn’t hide anything

823
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:37,500
I didn’t deceive you

824
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:39,790
You didn’t deceive
I was deceived

825
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,760
As a girl I thought you
were suitable for me

826
01:06:46,060 --> 01:06:51,060
As I became a mother I realize
that you are not suitable for me

827
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:54,520
You are not suitable

828
01:06:56,010 --> 01:06:59,030
When I used to look at you
before I felt secured

829
01:07:00,190 --> 01:07:01,940
Now I feel scared

830
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:05,020
Niranjana

831
01:07:08,020 --> 01:07:10,520
Your hand is stained with
the blood of my child

832
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:16,020
I can never forgive you

833
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:22,270
If something happens to my child
- Its our child

834
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:26,560
The child is fine now

835
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:31,010
There’s a small stitch
near the cervical area

836
01:07:38,510 --> 01:07:39,510
Its my final decision

837
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:42,440
I am leaving with my child to Mumbai

838
01:07:45,010 --> 01:07:48,020
If you try to enter our lives again

839
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:50,770
My child will have a father

840
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:53,300
but will not have a mother

841
01:08:19,190 --> 01:08:20,480
Why have you brought us here?

842
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:24,980
Those standing in a line Look at
the girl standing in 5th position

843
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:39,440
Not just fifth position,
she’s your replica

844
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:47,400
She looks like your mother, my sister

845
01:08:48,230 --> 01:08:50,230
- Is it so?
- You have not seen your mother

846
01:08:51,730 --> 01:08:53,230
See her properly

847
01:09:41,850 --> 01:09:45,050
Swetha, I have a meeting in office. Let’s
finish it in an hour and leave together

848
01:09:45,270 --> 01:09:47,770
No please let me go home
Its really boring in office

849
01:09:47,790 --> 01:09:50,540
Cant you wait for an hour?
- No I can’t, let me go please

850
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:53,270
Enough Swetha, constantly arguing

851
01:09:53,270 --> 01:09:55,020
Mam, the meeting is ready

852
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,270
Ma, I am leaving

853
01:10:12,770 --> 01:10:14,250
Quick! Quick!

854
01:10:18,490 --> 01:10:21,730
Stop the car!

855
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:26,980
Stop!

856
01:10:28,230 --> 01:10:29,230
Tell me Swetha

857
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:33,200
Mom I am scared
Someone is chasing me

858
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:35,730
Swetha, what happened?

859
01:10:37,230 --> 01:10:38,230
I know who they are

860
01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:40,240
Security

861
01:10:42,730 --> 01:10:44,200
You are trying to show your true colour?

862
01:10:44,230 --> 01:10:46,460
You are trying to take my child
away from me with your people

863
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:47,920
You will never trust me till the end

864
01:10:48,730 --> 01:10:50,230
I am in the railway station to leave

865
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:53,280
I know you are chasing my kid
now at Dharavi junction road

866
01:10:53,530 --> 01:10:55,520
Dharavi junction, me?

867
01:10:56,230 --> 01:10:58,470
If you try to touch the child

868
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:05,340
What happened?

869
01:11:10,330 --> 01:11:12,330
Amma, the driver has
abandoned the car and left

870
01:11:15,150 --> 01:11:17,230
I am on my way there
They won’t do anything to you

871
01:11:24,730 --> 01:11:27,230
Knives! My God

872
01:11:27,770 --> 01:11:29,760
They are not the people I thought

873
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:32,660
Run Swetha

874
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:35,980
Madam the vehicle is blocked

875
01:14:32,910 --> 01:14:33,910
Come!

876
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:01,740
Nothing will happen

877
01:15:03,690 --> 01:15:04,690
He will take care

878
01:16:51,330 --> 01:16:53,330
Swetha

879
01:17:11,580 --> 01:17:16,230
Look at this! Who are you?

880
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:21,220
What you say is right?

881
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:25,230
Had I known who it was, you
would have been dead by now

882
01:17:27,730 --> 01:17:29,730
Who will fight with a corpse?

883
01:17:33,230 --> 01:17:35,980
You are so courageous?

884
01:17:36,730 --> 01:17:38,730
Before you touch a girl

885
01:17:39,230 --> 01:17:42,730
if you check if she has a
father, brother or other

886
01:17:43,470 --> 01:17:45,970
But if she has a father a mother

887
01:17:46,730 --> 01:17:48,730
If they have fought and separated

888
01:17:49,230 --> 01:17:54,400
If the father is wilting in pain
that he’s unable to raise her

889
01:17:55,730 --> 01:17:58,480
If you try to touch such a child

890
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:03,470
If the father hits to show his love

891
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:06,160
Even if the GOD descends down

892
01:18:07,230 --> 01:18:08,730
he cannot stop him

893
01:18:08,860 --> 01:18:10,860
Let's meet!

894
01:18:11,230 --> 01:18:13,480
Name is Thookudurai
From Then district

895
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:15,230
The place is Koduvilarpatti

896
01:18:15,230 --> 01:18:18,230
Wife’s name is Niranjana
Daughter’s name is Swetha

897
01:18:18,980 --> 01:18:20,980
Come one on one

898
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,300
We've started the investigation!

899
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:40,000
Will contact you in 48 hours
once I get details on the attack

900
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:45,500
- Please maam
- I am extremely sorry

901
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:48,460
She has a life threat,
it's not safe for her here

902
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:50,500
I'm sending her abroad

903
01:18:51,210 --> 01:18:53,710
In 10 days we have Junior
National Athletic meet

904
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Participating in it is her ambition

905
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:58,960
She has been training day and night
for the past two and half years

906
01:18:59,130 --> 01:19:01,630
More than her ambition,
I value her safety

907
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
You can leave coach!
- Sorry maam

908
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:06,500
Niranjana

909
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:13,500
Swetha likes Sprinting a lot

910
01:19:14,130 --> 01:19:19,630
We know how much dejection when
we don't get what we desired

911
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:24,920
Swetha, just didn't desire
to participate in this

912
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,500
she has worked hard!

913
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:31,000
I'll be with her and take
care for these 10 days?

914
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:35,000
Are you planning to use this
situation to your advantage?

915
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Promise, not!

916
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:42,000
I won't tell her that I am
her dad at any situation

917
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:45,380
Not as a dad!

918
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:47,340
As a bodyguard!

919
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,500
As a worker

920
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,000
I will be her safety

921
01:19:53,630 --> 01:19:56,130
If Durai is by her, no
one can get close to her

922
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,500
You too know that!
Say yes!

923
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Okay

924
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:08,460
How much should I pay you?

925
01:20:12,130 --> 01:20:14,130
I am ok with anything you give

926
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:17,500
Madam!

927
01:20:21,050 --> 01:20:23,050
Maam, Swetha is calling you

928
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Thank you doctor!

929
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,500
- Are you feeling better baby?
- Yes ma

930
01:20:34,340 --> 01:20:36,340
I'll start the practice tomorrow!

931
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,500
Who attacked me?

932
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,500
It must be my business enemies!

933
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
The Police will take care of it

934
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:45,000
You don't worry

935
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:47,500
Where is the one that saved me?

936
01:20:59,050 --> 01:21:01,130
- Are you fine?
- I am!

937
01:21:01,670 --> 01:21:02,670
Thanks a lot, uncle!

938
01:21:03,050 --> 01:21:04,800
You aren't hurt, isn't it?

939
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,800
You are fine, right?

940
01:21:07,050 --> 01:21:08,210
I am fine

941
01:21:08,380 --> 01:21:12,170
Do something for him

942
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:16,300
- Ok
- Thanks a lot uncle

943
01:21:17,630 --> 01:21:19,130
Thanks

944
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:35,750
Who can get close to my girl?

945
01:21:36,210 --> 01:21:38,210
10 days I am going
to be by my girl

946
01:21:38,710 --> 01:21:43,920
10 years where were you hiding this smile.
We were waiting to see this

947
01:21:44,380 --> 01:21:46,880
Shall we rock this!

948

01:22:48,710 --> 01:22:53,170
The world will shiver
On the arrival of this Maduraian

955
01:23:46,130 --> 01:23:51,500
My thoughts are becoming
reality one after another

956
01:23:52,210 --> 01:23:57,460
The clouds above keep
showering me with love

957
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:00,750
You are born a fetus!
We are righteous to death

958
01:24:01,050 --> 01:24:03,050
Just few days in between

959
01:24:03,710 --> 01:24:06,750
Your style must make them run
Your looks must give them shivers

960
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:09,250
Only then are you my gang

My conscience is my responsibility!
Nothing else will work with me

You all are broad

978
01:26:17,210 --> 01:26:18,960
We would need an auto to look around you'll

979
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:20,800
I don't like it

980
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:22,710
What's your name?

981
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:24,920
Durai!
Thooku durai!

982
01:26:25,130 --> 01:26:26,630
You make it sound like you are James Bond

He our village's James Bond

984
01:26:28,090 --> 01:26:30,590
Durai is deleted, Only Thooku is ok!

985
01:26:30,590 --> 01:26:32,340
- How Thooku?
- We will lift you!

986
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:34,340
- How old are you?
- Just 47

987
01:26:34,670 --> 01:26:36,670

989
01:26:38,340 --> 01:26:41,840
Madam, must have told everything

990
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:43,340
Who are you?

991

If you want to tell something to madam,

1000
01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:16,300
- In the first ring?
- Even before that!

01:27:16,340 --> 01:27:17,840
We take it at the earliest

1002
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:22,710
Durai, come inside!

1003
01:27:23,210 --> 01:27:26,210
Madam, first inform the manager

Go in

1008
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,500
Can you identify those
who attacked the kid?

1009
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:45,500
No, Kesavan sir

1010
01:27:46,710 --> 01:27:48,710
Now what?

1011
01:27:48,750 --> 01:27:52,250
Shall I tell directly or through you?

1012
01:27:52,750 --> 01:27:54,340
You are getting me in trouble, isn't it?

1013
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:55,750
Yes

1014
01:27:56,750 --> 01:27:59,750
If he decides to give,
he will give generously

1015
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:04,250
- Ask if you need more?
- Why ride over me!

1016
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,750
Our suspect details madam!

1017
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:09,920
Mr.Rajeshwar

1018
01:28:10,170 --> 01:28:14,380
I know nothing Leave me!

1019
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
I know nothing

1020
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:21,710
Rajeshwar is a family man, he
wouldn't have done such a thing

1021
01:28:21,710 --> 01:28:23,710
Yes, it can't be him

1022
01:28:24,250 --> 01:28:26,500
Madam says so, but how him?

1023
01:28:27,250 --> 01:28:30,750
The second suspect, your companies
Ex-employee Ramesh Mishra

1024
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,250
- Ramesh Mehra
- Yeah, Mehra

1025
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:37,920
- How do you know?
- He said so

1026
01:28:38,130 --> 01:28:40,500
I know nothing, leave me!

1027
01:28:41,250 --> 01:28:43,250
Please leave me!

1028
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:48,500
Your Ex-husband, Swetha's dad

1029
01:28:49,050 --> 01:28:50,500
We suspect him too

1030
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:51,800
I too have that doubt

1031
01:28:52,250 --> 01:28:55,800
If someone abandoned our Madam, there
can not be a more evil person than him

1032
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,800
Call back home

1033
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:04,800
If you hand him over to me, will grind
him and eat him up as my breakfast

1034
01:29:06,670 --> 01:29:07,500
Attend the phone, manager

1035
01:29:07,590 --> 01:29:08,710
In the middle of a meeting

1036
01:29:09,090 --> 01:29:11,090
(CONTINUOUS SWEARING)

1037
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:14,880
COME OUTSIDE!

1038
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,420
- The one who swears at the family
- Sekar? - Yes him!

1039
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:22,960
He would swear loads!

1040
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:36,300
Everyone is looking at their work
WHo did this work?
There is chance for it to be him

1041
01:29:37,210 --> 01:29:38,500
Thank you, Inspector
- Welcome

1042
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:40,500
- Kesavan
- Madam

1043
01:29:41,090 --> 01:29:42,090
For their stay?

1044
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:46,750
You insulted me hiring them without my
consultation, yet I am doing my work

1045
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:50,750
In the old car shed we had
old dal sacked up there

1046
01:29:51,750 --> 01:29:54,750
We can clear that and
load this group in there

1047
01:29:55,590 --> 01:29:56,750
Thooku, why look there

1048
01:29:57,460 --> 01:29:59,460
Back means this side

1049
01:30:00,750 --> 01:30:02,750
Will you let us to stay here?

1050
01:30:03,460 --> 01:30:05,710
You can't stay there

1051
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:07,750
Manager Kesavan stays there

1052
01:30:08,750 --> 01:30:10,250
Madam, won't hand the key easily

1053
01:30:11,250 --> 01:30:12,750
Give them the keys

1054
01:30:15,130 --> 01:30:18,250
I felt like you told me
to hand them the keys

1055
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,250
They said that!

1056
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:23,500
Give the keys to them

1057
01:30:26,250 --> 01:30:28,250
Then me?

1058
01:30:28,630 --> 01:30:30,630
It's okay, let him stay with us

1059
01:30:31,250 --> 01:30:37,250
It's me who has to be okay with you all
And not you!

1060
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,210
You are not giving me my space

1061
01:30:40,750 --> 01:30:42,750
You understand yet you tell you don't?

1062
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:43,750
Yes!

1063
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Did you hire him?

1064
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:47,500
Yes

1065
01:30:47,710 --> 01:30:50,250
Durai, take her to practice

1066
01:30:50,750 --> 01:30:52,750
- Shall we?
- Sure Durai uncle

1067
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:54,630
Thanks to the lord!
Thanks to the lord!

1068
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:59,500
It has happened as I wished

1069
01:31:00,250 --> 01:31:02,250
Has he become an ISRO scientist

1070
01:31:02,750 --> 01:31:04,250
He is just the driver

1071
01:31:04,250 --> 01:31:06,000
- Driver?
WE have appointed him.What?
- Why are you shocked?

1072
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:07,750
What I meant to say..

1073
01:31:08,750 --> 01:31:09,250
Sir!

1074
01:31:09,750 --> 01:31:12,250
Kesavan, you bring that in

1075
01:31:18,050 --> 01:31:19,500
In ten days, we have our final meet

1076
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:21,460
You have a good speed

1077
01:31:21,460 --> 01:31:22,460
- keep it up
- Sure

1078
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:24,960
Thanks Uncle

1079
01:31:25,300 --> 01:31:26,300
Give that to me

1080
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:28,460
- See you tomorrow sir
- Bye

1081
01:31:30,050 --> 01:31:32,050
I saw you run

1082
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:34,800
You run like a
rabbit, how is that?

1083
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:39,500
The reason for that is My dad

1084
01:31:43,710 --> 01:31:46,590
- Why?
- When I started coaching

1085
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:50,880
Chief coach said that emotion
is important in sports

1086
01:31:51,630 --> 01:31:53,630
The best emotion is Anger

1087
01:31:55,050 --> 01:31:59,050
Think of the one you hate
most to be the floor

1088
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:01,500
Stamp them and run

1089
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:05,000
It will push you forward

1090
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:11,050
I hate my father the most

1091
01:32:20,630 --> 01:32:22,000
My parents separated

1092
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:24,750
What did I do wrong?

1093
01:32:24,750 --> 01:32:27,750
My father could come to see me!

1094
01:32:30,710 --> 01:32:31,960
You don't know Uncle

1095
01:32:32,460 --> 01:32:34,960
For Parent's day and sports
day only mom would come

1096
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:38,460
When my friends or
teacher ask about my dad

1097
01:32:39,460 --> 01:32:40,960
It would leave me tearful

1098
01:32:41,590 --> 01:32:47,590
My deary eyes! My deary eyes!
Come lean over me

1099
01:32:48,460 --> 01:32:54,960
Soothe this wounded heart
with your blossoming hands

1100
01:32:55,960 --> 01:33:02,170
I stay waiting, for ages
to carry away my worries

1101
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:09,460
I stand watching, for my lighting to
strike through these thunderous skies

1102
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:12,710
My tears drizzle through these clouds

1103
01:33:13,090 --> 01:33:17,590
My tears add up to sugar lumps

1104
01:33:48,130 --> 01:33:54,000
My deary eyes! My deary eyes!
Come lean over me

1105
01:33:55,500 --> 01:34:01,210
Soothe this wounded heart
with your blossoming hands

1106
01:34:35,630 --> 01:34:37,130
You are in trouble now

1107
01:34:38,250 --> 01:34:40,000
Manager sir, can you do one favor?

1108
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:42,500
What favor?
- We played in the rain

1109
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Can you ask madam to forgive us?

1110
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:47,750
I will do!

1111
01:35:05,380 --> 01:35:08,300
Where did this respect
go all these days?

1112
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:10,500
Forgive me sir!

1113
01:35:14,090 --> 01:35:16,090
Not caring about getting
wet, I got hold of them

1114
01:35:22,050 --> 01:35:23,300
Did you play around?

1115
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:26,050
Be brave!
I am there

1116
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:28,300
No!

1117
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:31,800
You are lying, isn't it!

1118
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:36,300
Madam, ask them both at once

1119
01:35:37,050 --> 01:35:38,500
Did you both play in the rain?

1120
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:40,800
- No
- Yes

1121
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:45,050
Answer me correctly

1122
01:35:49,340 --> 01:35:51,340
- Answer me!
- Yes - No

1123
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:57,840
Move away!

1124
01:36:00,250 --> 01:36:02,750
Dry yourself!
Dry yourself!

1125
01:36:03,250 --> 01:36:04,250
Hold this

1126
01:36:05,250 --> 01:36:07,500
Why does this towel have strings

1127
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:11,050
An inner skirt will have a string

1128
01:36:11,710 --> 01:36:12,960
They are sneezing

1129
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:15,500
Go that way!

1130
01:36:18,630 --> 01:36:20,630
Pillow! What's this yellow!

1131
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:23,630
Turmeric milk for Durai so
he doesn't catch a cold!

1132
01:36:24,380 --> 01:36:26,880
Strength for the child,
so Badam milk for her

1133
01:36:27,130 --> 01:36:28,630
I got wet too, what milk for me?

1134
01:36:29,460 --> 01:36:31,460
Die today, milk tomorrow

1135
01:36:32,050 --> 01:36:35,750
Take it!
Badam milk, Turmeric milk

1136
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:37,340
Do you too want maam?

1137
01:36:37,630 --> 01:36:40,130
Take her inside

1138
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:42,960
Mom

1139
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:48,000
Durai uncle gives a
different emotion within me

1140
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:57,550
I've never had such a feeling before

1141
01:36:59,300 --> 01:37:01,550
- it feels new
- Thank the lord

1142
01:37:02,050 --> 01:37:04,050
- Filomina
- I prayed to the lord

1143
01:37:04,460 --> 01:37:05,960
Come

1144
01:37:07,670 --> 01:37:09,170
Mr. Durai

1145
01:37:11,170 --> 01:37:13,630
You said you won't make the
situation favorable for you

1146
01:37:14,630 --> 01:37:17,130
I thought 10 minutes to hire you!

1147
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:20,130
It will only take seconds to fire you

1148
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:28,420
Thooku Durai

1149
01:37:29,130 --> 01:37:31,630
Niranjana, said it out of ignorance
Don't keep it at heart

1150
01:37:33,380 --> 01:37:35,380
She talked after 10 years to me

1151
01:37:36,130 --> 01:37:37,630
And you ask me to forget it

1152
01:37:38,090 --> 01:37:40,590
The wife scolding and the
husband listening to it

1153
01:37:41,130 --> 01:37:42,130
It's the law of the world

1154
01:37:43,420 --> 01:37:44,920
That is not important for me

1155
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,750
Someone is trying to kill my daughter

1156
01:37:48,630 --> 01:37:49,630
Who is he?

1157
01:37:57,340 --> 01:37:59,340
Where is he?

1158
01:38:03,380 --> 01:38:06,090
His name is ThookuDurai, from a small
village in south of Tamil Nadu

1159
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:08,920
He owns a rice mill

1160
01:38:12,050 --> 01:38:14,050
Just another villager

1161
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:20,400
Won't you all take a leave,
swearing all 24 hours

1162
01:38:20,730 --> 01:38:24,990
If you want to waste time, post a meme on
Social media and make yourselves happy

1163
01:38:25,730 --> 01:38:28,290
Do you thinks us to be cowards to
hide ourselves in social media?

1164
01:38:28,740 --> 01:38:30,730
We would face it over the call

1165
01:38:31,230 --> 01:38:35,480
One question, why scold me
"Swimming pool"

1166
01:38:36,240 --> 01:38:38,240
Damm swimming pool

1167
01:38:40,740 --> 01:38:42,740
Run away you!

1168
01:38:43,490 --> 01:38:45,490
Thanks to this new Sim

1169
01:38:50,730 --> 01:38:52,740
How would call me now?

1170
01:38:54,470 --> 01:38:57,740
This must be the verification call

1171
01:38:58,240 --> 01:38:59,240
Yes!

1172
01:39:00,070 --> 01:39:03,310
(SWEARING CONTINUOUSLY)

1173
01:39:03,420 --> 01:39:06,670
How did you find this number even
before I get the verification call?

1174
01:39:08,090 --> 01:39:09,600
Continue your swearing!

1175
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:16,480
I too repeat the same

1176
01:39:17,230 --> 01:39:19,230
I won't listen

1177
01:39:20,740 --> 01:39:22,230
From where did you
learn to argue

1178
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:24,500
I know from who!
Shall I tell it?

1179
01:39:25,270 --> 01:39:26,770
- Filomina!
- I'll go inside

1180
01:39:27,990 --> 01:39:29,240
- Do anything!
- I will

1181
01:39:47,320 --> 01:39:50,200
- Can you move 2 feet
- Want to fall at my feet for forgiveness?

1182
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:53,700
You are hiding my brothers view

1183
01:39:54,700 --> 01:39:57,200
Madam!
Madam!

1184
01:39:58,440 --> 01:40:01,200
Move to your right!
At least, to the left

1185
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:03,700
Can you hide behind that pillar?

1186
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:06,240
- What happened now?
- How will I explain it to you?

1187
01:40:09,700 --> 01:40:11,700
You both, close your ears

1188
01:40:13,210 --> 01:40:16,000
Like a villager eying a sweet shop

1189
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Candy shop, right?

1190
01:40:17,350 --> 01:40:19,350
That was just an example

1191
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:21,500
You hired someone new, isn't it?

1192
01:40:21,880 --> 01:40:23,380
He is....

1193
01:40:23,540 --> 01:40:24,540
How will I?

1194
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:26,500
He is eying you!

1195
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:30,000
Is this the reaction?

1196
01:40:33,670 --> 01:40:36,490
Look at him now, he would
look to the sides then

1197
01:40:37,310 --> 01:40:41,800
Cut the charm and show some anger, or
he would take it to be an acceptance

1198
01:40:44,980 --> 01:40:47,740
You are the first hubby to eye his own wife

1199
01:40:50,300 --> 01:40:53,500
Just a force.
Did you eye at madam?

1200
01:40:55,500 --> 01:40:57,500
If it's yes, we should say so
That's why he said so

1201
01:40:58,980 --> 01:41:01,470
You look beautiful.
Happy birthday

1202
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:09,730
Not knowing how to wish her for the
birthday, you were helplessly seeing her

1203
01:41:10,250 --> 01:41:12,000
I took that in a wrong way

1204
01:41:12,340 --> 01:41:13,520
Leave it, uncle!

1205
01:41:13,770 --> 01:41:15,770
Does the driver know about mom's birthday?

1206
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,930
Driver Uncle, it's mom's birthday.
Come wish her

1207
01:41:19,170 --> 01:41:20,680
Sharp girl!

1208
01:41:21,780 --> 01:41:24,280
Go!

1209
01:41:40,590 --> 01:41:45,500
When I feel like hugging you!
I would shake hands with you

1210
01:41:46,500 --> 01:41:49,500
When I shake hands, it's
me giving you a hug

1211
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,420
Happy birthday Niranjana

1212
01:41:56,770 --> 01:41:58,770
Madam!

1213
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:14,040
Excellent timing Swetha! This is
your best record. What did you try?

1214
01:42:14,540 --> 01:42:16,040
I didn't try anything new

1215
01:42:16,790 --> 01:42:18,540
- Durai uncle!
- Yes!

1216
01:42:19,160 --> 01:42:20,660
You encouragement is great

1217
01:42:21,150 --> 01:42:23,150
You must do so in the finals too

1218
01:42:23,540 --> 01:42:27,030
We do ten time of this then

1219
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:31,500
Everyone is waiting, I informed you
about the birthday party, dint I?

1220
01:42:31,610 --> 01:42:33,110
I told you

1221
01:42:34,610 --> 01:42:35,860
You don't need to go there

1222
01:42:36,490 --> 01:42:39,240
She is my best friend, please understand

1223
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:41,810
They are all waiting for me, that's why

1224
01:42:42,610 --> 01:42:44,100
Mom, please understand

1225
01:42:46,110 --> 01:42:48,000
- I want you to be home at 7
- Mom, just a day

1226
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,000
What happened?

1227
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,250
The birthday party is
happening in a theme park

1228
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,500
Mom, tells me not to go

1229
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
We had a fight all night

1230
01:42:57,740 --> 01:43:00,230
I asked but she isn't allowing

1231
01:43:00,350 --> 01:43:01,350
Shall I take you?

1232
01:43:01,540 --> 01:43:03,760
She would be furious
if she learns about it

1233
01:43:04,810 --> 01:43:06,230
I'll take care

1234
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:24,230
What's the emergency?

1235
01:43:24,520 --> 01:43:25,520
I'll explain

1236
01:43:33,100 --> 01:43:34,850
5-6 of them have come to kill my daughter

1237
01:43:35,350 --> 01:43:37,350
Let's leave from here then

1238
01:43:38,100 --> 01:43:39,140
Knowing, I bought her here

1239
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:40,360
Why?

1240
01:43:42,450 --> 01:43:44,450
What would we do if the
tiger enters the village?

1241
01:43:45,070 --> 01:43:47,320
We tie a goat at the end of the village

1242
01:43:50,450 --> 01:43:52,700
We won't know where the tiger is..

1243
01:43:53,950 --> 01:43:55,200
The goat too won't know

1244
01:43:57,200 --> 01:43:59,700
We will wait for it to come for the goat

1245
01:44:05,450 --> 01:44:07,170
The moment the tiger gets close to the goat

1246
01:44:07,450 --> 01:44:08,590
We will hunt down the tiger

1247
01:44:08,910 --> 01:44:10,150
That's what is gonna happen now

1248
01:44:10,700 --> 01:44:12,700
Why risk our child's life

1249
01:44:13,370 --> 01:44:15,620
No other way to know who the tiger is.

1250
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:08,970
Durai Uncle, It's about to be 8PM,
Mom will scold, what to do?

1251
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:10,480
What shall we?

1252
01:47:10,700 --> 01:47:15,470
Last time we answered differently, this
time let's give same answers and escape

1253
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,000
Okay

1254
01:47:25,960 --> 01:47:27,960
Manager sir!

1255
01:47:28,980 --> 01:47:30,480
Why call me in an husky voice?

1256
01:47:30,730 --> 01:47:32,980
Just like the last time, can you help?

1257
01:47:33,480 --> 01:47:35,980
Shall I join my legs and fold my hands?

1258
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,250
My name is knobhead, not Kesavan

1259
01:47:40,250 --> 01:47:41,750
It's Kesavan

1260
01:47:42,250 --> 01:47:43,890
Are you asking the questions, or shall I?

1261
01:47:44,200 --> 01:47:45,000
What got you late?

1262
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
The Tyre got punctured

1263
01:47:47,620 --> 01:47:50,620
He must have leaked the question paper

1264
01:47:50,870 --> 01:47:52,620
When did the Tyre get punctured?

1265
01:47:52,620 --> 01:47:54,120
- At 7 Pm
- At 7 Pm

1266
01:47:54,620 --> 01:47:57,300
Can't you inform us about it?

1267
01:47:57,370 --> 01:47:59,670
- Correct!
- We did call Manager sir!

1268
01:48:00,370 --> 01:48:01,420
But the phone was switched off

1269
01:48:04,300 --> 01:48:05,240
- Kesavan!
- Madam?

1270
01:48:05,870 --> 01:48:06,670
Why is your phone switched off?

1271
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:08,340
- For some personal reasons
- Switch it on

1272
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:10,800
- Please no!
- Switch it on!

1273
01:48:13,290 --> 01:48:15,090
(CONTINUOUS SWEARING)

1274
01:48:17,290 --> 01:48:18,490
They called you outside, not inside

1275
01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:21,340
What does LK Balu mean?

1276
01:48:22,040 --> 01:48:23,840
Then why do use that word?

1277
01:48:24,540 --> 01:48:26,340
Which Tyre got punctured?

1278
01:48:31,330 --> 01:48:32,130
Look straight and answer

1279
01:48:33,250 --> 01:48:34,050
- The front
- The back

1280
01:48:36,750 --> 01:48:37,800
What's this!

1281
01:48:38,340 --> 01:48:39,260
From the back it's the front

1282
01:48:39,750 --> 01:48:40,300
From the front it's the back

1283
01:48:40,710 --> 01:48:41,790
From the side, it's the side one

1284
01:48:42,250 --> 01:48:43,520
Opening the trunk you find the stepney

1285
01:48:43,750 --> 01:48:46,050
However you see, it's Tyre all over

1286
01:48:47,250 --> 01:48:50,250
If an illiterate like me can understand,
an educated like you doesn't understand?

1287
01:48:50,820 --> 01:48:52,050
The gown girl is our team!

1288
01:48:53,250 --> 01:48:57,570
You've been training for 2 years to run
and don't you know what to do now?

1289
01:48:58,750 --> 01:49:00,550
- What should I?
- Run inside

1290
01:49:01,250 --> 01:49:02,560
Sharp dad!

1291
01:49:03,270 --> 01:49:04,330
- Swetha?
- One sec mom

1292
01:49:06,180 --> 01:49:08,470
If anything like this
happens, call me directly

1293
01:49:09,100 --> 01:49:10,900
Filomina, give my phone number to him

1294
01:49:11,270 --> 01:49:14,810
Your phone, car, Aadhar, and even the
lucky number. I'll give it all to him

1295
01:49:15,520 --> 01:49:17,320
- Filomina!
- Lets go give dinner to Swetha!

1296
01:49:18,770 --> 01:49:20,570
Go! Go!

1297
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:34,320
He is called D'souza

1298
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:35,820
I know nothing more

1299
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,030
- Where is D'souza?
- He is in that ring

1300
01:49:51,590 --> 01:49:52,910
Who asked to kill Swetha?

1301
01:49:54,130 --> 01:49:55,430
Fight me!

1302
01:49:56,630 --> 01:49:58,430
You know Thai boxing?

1303
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:00,180
What is he telling?

1304
01:50:01,130 --> 01:50:02,930
It's punches of his native, it seems

1305
01:50:04,380 --> 01:50:06,430
Punch and then talk

1306
01:50:08,130 --> 01:50:09,430
Show it to him

1307
01:50:21,630 --> 01:50:22,930
The crab catch

1308
01:50:23,630 --> 01:50:25,430
It is crab catch

1309
01:50:27,130 --> 01:50:29,430
Swirl him like that

1310
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:43,000
This is the twister

1311
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,300
This is the iguana lock
- What's it in English?

1312
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,030
You can't move, you can only talk

1313
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:52,840
I'll tell!
I'll tell!

1314
01:50:56,590 --> 01:50:59,280
- Good morning!
- How did you come inside? Who are you?

1315
01:51:00,010 --> 01:51:02,550
Don't shout! My uncle is still asleep

1316
01:51:05,750 --> 01:51:08,300
I've been waiting for an hour so
not to disturb a sleeping person

1317
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,220
And you shout as soon as you get up

1318
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:14,800
Who ordered to kill the child?

1319
01:51:15,140 --> 01:51:16,000
I don't know anything

1320
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,300
He is still sleepy, so he remembers nothing

1321
01:51:20,240 --> 01:51:24,300
If he bathes, he will talk then

1322
01:51:25,010 --> 01:51:26,800
One pot of water and one flower blossomed

1323
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:28,810
I don't know!

1324
01:51:30,010 --> 01:51:31,800
Two pots of water and two flowers blossomed

1325
01:51:33,500 --> 01:51:36,050
I don't know

1326
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,050
Three pots of water and
three flowers blossomed

1327
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,800
- I'll talk!
- That's good my boy!

1328
01:51:57,500 --> 01:52:00,050
Fire alarm!
We have to evacuate immediately

1329
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:15,800
This isn't our route!

1330
01:52:17,240 --> 01:52:18,040
Who are you?

1331
01:52:18,920 --> 01:52:20,490
Stop it!

1332
01:52:32,020 --> 01:52:33,820
Welcome sir!

1333
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:41,240
Sit under the fan!
I'll be there

1334
01:52:43,290 --> 01:52:45,840
Suleman! order two teas

1335
01:52:46,470 --> 01:52:50,270
- Special Tea!
- Sit down!

1336
01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:52,280
Sir, I wanted to see you

1337
01:52:52,980 --> 01:52:56,280
You are a big shot it seems, and I need to
get an appointment six month before that

1338
01:52:56,980 --> 01:52:58,780
I would have to meet 3 other
managers in 3 months time

1339
01:52:59,230 --> 01:53:00,530
It isn't possible they said

1340
01:53:02,230 --> 01:53:04,280
Then I got a thought

1341
01:53:05,230 --> 01:53:08,540
It's hard for a small guy like
me to see a big shot like you

1342
01:53:09,240 --> 01:53:11,550
But it's easy for you to meet me

1343
01:53:12,500 --> 01:53:14,300
That why this arrangements

1344
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:15,800
How is it?

1345
01:53:17,310 --> 01:53:19,110
Uncle!

1346
01:53:19,880 --> 01:53:22,100
Double Parrot matches!
Still have few sticks in them

1347
01:53:29,290 --> 01:53:30,330
Your Swetha's father, isn't it?

1348
01:53:30,770 --> 01:53:31,820
What did you say?

1349
01:53:32,770 --> 01:53:34,070
You are Swetha's father, isn't it?

1350
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:35,340
Once more?

1351
01:53:36,040 --> 01:53:37,590
You are Swetha's father?

1352
01:53:37,790 --> 01:53:40,000
I feels so joyous to hear this!

1353
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:41,800
I am Swetha's father!

1354
01:53:41,800 --> 01:53:42,000
You told it fine!

1355
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,800
Suleman, cancel sir's tea

1356
01:53:45,880 --> 01:53:46,930
Ragi malt

1357
01:53:49,250 --> 01:53:51,800
- Do you know me?
- I've got loads of time, go on

1358
01:53:52,500 --> 01:53:54,300
CEO of Aditya exports and imports

1359
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,800
I own a chain of 2000
restaurants in 27 countries

1360
01:53:58,500 --> 01:54:00,550
7 engineering and 2 medical colleges

1361
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,050
Former president of the
Sports Authority of India

1362
01:54:03,250 --> 01:54:04,800
Honorary member of CCI

1363
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:06,800
Know who you are clashing with

1364
01:54:07,480 --> 01:54:09,280
Do you know who I am?

1365
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:11,800
You said something for 10 minutes

1366
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:14,800
Someone knows nothing about all of that

1367
01:54:17,750 --> 01:54:20,300
I don't clash looking at someones class!

1368
01:54:27,680 --> 01:54:28,530
I'll make you understand

1369
01:54:29,730 --> 01:54:32,690
With the money I own,
not just this Tea shop

1370
01:54:33,980 --> 01:54:35,030
I can buy out this area

1371
01:54:35,730 --> 01:54:37,030
If I stamp you

1372
01:54:37,730 --> 01:54:40,280
You won't take another breath then!

1373
01:54:41,480 --> 01:54:42,280
Awesome dude!

1374
01:54:42,860 --> 01:54:44,660
What's with money!

1375
01:54:46,090 --> 01:54:48,300
There is not a rich who hasn't cried

1376
01:54:49,480 --> 01:54:51,240
Or a poor who hasn't had his laugh in life

1377
01:54:51,850 --> 01:54:53,900
How!
Keep rocking!

1378
01:54:54,730 --> 01:54:57,780
Truly, for thinking to kill my daughter

1379
01:54:58,890 --> 01:55:00,940
I should be raged, truly

1380
01:55:02,240 --> 01:55:04,310
But I like you!
Do you know why?

1381
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:10,960
I was eagerly waiting
to see my girl once

1382
01:55:12,730 --> 01:55:13,780
Your villainous!

1383
01:55:15,150 --> 01:55:16,700
Taking care of her is my work now!

1384
01:55:18,150 --> 01:55:22,450
How to tell, I forgive and
thank him in English?

1385
01:55:22,730 --> 01:55:24,530
Thanks a lot from bottom of the heart

1386
01:55:25,230 --> 01:55:27,030
Is it hard?

1387
01:55:27,480 --> 01:55:29,280
It's long
- I'll shorten it!

1388
01:55:33,020 --> 01:55:34,030
Heart, Thanks

1389
01:55:34,730 --> 01:55:36,030
Hearty thanks!

1390
01:55:36,730 --> 01:55:37,550
Let's leave

1391
01:55:38,490 --> 01:55:40,290
Think again and forget my daughter

1392
01:55:41,190 --> 01:55:43,240
Don't let my calmness
let you think otherwise

1393
01:55:44,250 --> 01:55:46,050
I slash you!

1394
01:55:46,400 --> 01:55:49,950
Then you will not be
identifiable to you mom

1395
01:55:50,740 --> 01:55:51,550
And your wife

1396
01:55:56,490 --> 01:55:57,540
Take him carefully!

1397
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:04,580
Man of the year, Mr. Gautham Veer

1398
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,000
The top for the decade

1399
01:56:07,500 --> 01:56:12,670
Skyline constructions. No.1 position

1400
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,540
Our skyline project has dropped 47 points

1401
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:17,410
This is the first time in 10 years

1402
01:56:17,660 --> 01:56:19,660
We are no more in the first position

1403
01:56:20,080 --> 01:56:21,080
Right?

1404
01:56:21,330 --> 01:56:24,330
Aravindh Roy, new builders are getting
projects with political influence

1405
01:56:24,830 --> 01:56:27,830
Even if it's 100
percentage, just buy them

1406
01:56:28,330 --> 01:56:29,830
We would face a huge loss

1407
01:56:30,830 --> 01:56:33,830
Loss, Gain, profit is just my status

1408
01:56:34,500 --> 01:56:37,500
No.1 position is my identity

1409
01:56:38,040 --> 01:56:40,540
I won't lose it at any cause

1410
01:56:40,700 --> 01:56:42,700
How many work in this project?

1411
01:56:42,870 --> 01:56:45,950
- 5000 employees
- Fire them all

1412
01:56:46,580 --> 01:56:48,120
I should keep winning

1413
01:56:48,790 --> 01:56:50,290
Only winners should be by my side

1414
01:56:50,950 --> 01:56:52,950
I have no sentiments for my success

1415
01:56:59,950 --> 01:57:02,700
I won the district meet 100 mts

1416
01:57:03,660 --> 01:57:05,410
I'm selected for the State tournament

1417
01:57:06,160 --> 01:57:07,160
Who is my thunder?
- Me!

1418
01:57:07,700 --> 01:57:09,450
- Who is my rock star?
- Me!

1419
01:57:09,910 --> 01:57:12,160
- Like father!
- Like daughter

1420
01:57:13,290 --> 01:57:15,040
Me, winner

1421
01:57:15,500 --> 01:57:17,290
You, winner

1422
01:57:18,500 --> 01:57:20,500
My rock star!

1423
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:34,790
Our Neha, can't beat her 13.9 seconds mark

1424
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:37,700
If this continues, she won't get
herself selected for the nationals

1425
01:57:43,870 --> 01:57:44,950
Dad!

1426
01:57:47,500 --> 01:57:48,500
Dad!

1427
01:57:49,250 --> 01:57:51,250
Dad

1428
01:57:54,790 --> 01:57:56,250
Dad

1429
01:58:09,830 --> 01:58:10,830
Dad

1430
01:58:14,950 --> 01:58:15,950
Dad

1431
01:58:16,700 --> 01:58:19,200
I can't bear this silence between us

1432
01:58:19,700 --> 01:58:21,250
Please talk to me

1433
01:58:26,200 --> 01:58:27,200
That is me

1434
01:58:28,120 --> 01:58:30,120
No.1 student in Cambridge university

1435
01:58:30,290 --> 01:58:33,000
Gold medalist in Athletics

1436
01:58:33,080 --> 01:58:35,870
Now, I'm the No.1 businessman in the city

1437
01:58:36,120 --> 01:58:38,620
This is the position you should be at

1438
01:58:39,290 --> 01:58:41,790
Winning is in my blood

1439
01:58:42,830 --> 01:58:46,080
If you lose, you are no more my daughter

1440
01:58:49,370 --> 01:58:54,370
My affection for you
will vanish if you lose

1441
01:58:55,160 --> 01:58:58,160
Dad, I won't lose!
I won't lose!

1442
01:58:58,910 --> 01:59:00,910
How we win isn't important

1443
01:59:01,160 --> 01:59:02,410
We should win

1444
01:59:04,660 --> 01:59:06,660
To win is life

1445
01:59:06,950 --> 01:59:08,950
To lose is death

1446
01:59:09,410 --> 01:59:11,910
Now tell me, who is my thunder?

1447
01:59:12,910 --> 01:59:15,160
- Who is my rock star?
- Me!

1448
01:59:15,410 --> 01:59:17,410
- To win is
- life

1449
01:59:17,410 --> 01:59:19,910
- To lose is
- death

1450
01:59:31,660 --> 01:59:33,000
Come on, one more time

1451
01:59:34,410 --> 01:59:37,700
District selection is about to
start, all the best contestants

1452
01:59:50,370 --> 01:59:53,080
Swetha, double up

1453
01:59:55,700 --> 01:59:57,000
Come on, double up!

1454
01:59:57,540 --> 02:00:00,040
Neha, Double up

1455
02:00:07,700 --> 02:00:09,120
Well done, all the best

1456
02:00:10,250 --> 02:00:12,250
Excuse me, Neha

1457
02:00:12,500 --> 02:00:13,500
I got selected

1458
02:00:13,830 --> 02:00:16,580
That's my girl, You
made me very happy

1459
02:00:17,910 --> 02:00:18,910
Congrats Neha

1460
02:00:25,790 --> 02:00:30,120
- What's this?
- It's nothing

1461
02:00:30,120 --> 02:00:32,870
Tell the truth, its a
banned drug, right?

1462
02:00:33,370 --> 02:00:34,370
It's nothing

1463
02:00:34,870 --> 02:00:36,620
I doubt you

1464
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:39,620
I'll complaint about this, the
test results will tell the truth

1465
02:00:40,120 --> 02:00:42,870
I have to win this competition

1466
02:00:43,370 --> 02:00:44,870
My coach suggested this

1467
02:00:45,950 --> 02:00:47,200
I didn't have an option

1468
02:00:47,620 --> 02:00:49,870
I warn you Swetha, If you
tell anyone about this

1469
02:00:52,120 --> 02:00:54,870
Neha, it's my ambition
too to win in Athletics

1470
02:00:55,620 --> 02:00:58,620
If you won it legally, I am OK with it

1471
02:00:59,120 --> 02:01:01,620
But if you cheat, I can't accept it

1472
02:01:02,120 --> 02:01:04,120
I have to complain, I'm sorry

1473
02:01:05,370 --> 02:01:07,120
Swetha

1474
02:01:07,830 --> 02:01:09,830
I should win

1475
02:01:10,580 --> 02:01:14,080
If you lose, you are no more my daughter

1476
02:01:17,080 --> 02:01:19,080
To win is life

1477
02:01:19,660 --> 02:01:21,660
To lose is...

1478
02:01:24,080 --> 02:01:26,580
Dad, sorry

1479
02:01:27,580 --> 02:01:29,580
- What happened?
- I lost

1480
02:01:30,580 --> 02:01:32,330
Where are you now?

1481
02:01:36,580 --> 02:01:39,830
- Neha, what happened?
- Sorry dad

1482
02:01:43,580 --> 02:01:45,580
Neha

1483
02:01:50,790 --> 02:01:54,790
She got caught in a tree
branch, so she was saved

1484
02:01:55,830 --> 02:01:58,580
Her nervous system is affected

1485
02:01:59,540 --> 02:02:02,290
Can't be sure if her limbs would work again

1486
02:02:02,950 --> 02:02:05,450
She is in a critical condition

1487
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,330
She is not just my heir

1488
02:02:22,330 --> 02:02:24,080
She is my future dream

1489
02:02:24,580 --> 02:02:27,040
That girl shouldn't be alive

1490
02:02:27,700 --> 02:02:30,250
Before it starts, her life has ended

1491
02:02:30,500 --> 02:02:34,540
The girl who is the reason
Should not be alive

1492
02:02:42,660 --> 02:02:44,500
Didn't you inform
Niranjana about this?

1493
02:02:44,950 --> 02:02:46,500
She shouldn't know

1494
02:02:46,910 --> 02:02:49,410
Niranjana, will send her abroad

1495
02:02:49,870 --> 02:02:53,370
Then her dream of winning
the race will vanish

1496
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,080
First time she has asked me for something

1497
02:02:58,870 --> 02:03:00,750
That she should participate
in this competition

1498
02:03:01,120 --> 02:03:02,370
That I must encourage her

1499
02:03:03,450 --> 02:03:06,500
I will make it happen even
if I have to risk my life

1500
02:03:11,620 --> 02:03:13,160
- Yes, Kadhar
- Durai

1501
02:03:29,200 --> 02:03:30,200
Sit down

1502
02:03:33,870 --> 02:03:35,870
I thought about it

1503
02:03:36,370 --> 02:03:43,120
Do one thing, like your daughter, make
my daughter walk smile and call me Dad

1504
02:03:44,120 --> 02:03:45,120
I'll forgive you

1505
02:03:45,620 --> 02:03:48,620
Why did you come panicking?

1506
02:03:49,370 --> 02:03:51,370
That I would hurt Kadhar?

1507
02:03:51,870 --> 02:03:53,870
Or his family?

1508
02:03:54,870 --> 02:03:56,370
Do you think I am a villain?

1509
02:03:57,330 --> 02:04:02,620
My target is your daughter who
destroyed my daughters life

1510
02:04:04,370 --> 02:04:06,370
I'm the hero of my story

1511
02:04:06,370 --> 02:04:07,620
That's right

1512
02:04:08,370 --> 02:04:09,870
You are the hero of your story

1513
02:04:10,870 --> 02:04:15,370
But in my story I am the villain

1514
02:04:17,620 --> 02:04:19,370
My wife avoids me

1515
02:04:20,330 --> 02:04:22,580
My daughter hates me

1516
02:04:23,620 --> 02:04:26,870
Even though I am
true, I am alone

1517
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,370
I am the villain in my story

1518
02:04:32,660 --> 02:04:34,910
In 48 hours the final race will happen

1519
02:04:35,160 --> 02:04:37,410
I kill her within that

1520
02:04:37,410 --> 02:04:39,410
Save her if you can

1521
02:04:40,160 --> 02:04:43,660
If not, It's not just me
that killed your daughter

1522
02:04:45,160 --> 02:04:46,910
You too for not saving her

1523
02:04:47,410 --> 02:04:52,660
I forgave you just so your innocent
daughter doesn't lose her father

1524
02:04:53,410 --> 02:04:54,660
You don't listen

1525
02:04:55,910 --> 02:04:59,910
We look for a good time only to give birth

1526
02:05:00,910 --> 02:05:02,660
Not to hack someone

1527
02:05:16,910 --> 02:05:18,910
Bro, phone

1528
02:05:19,410 --> 02:05:22,410
Niranjana and Swetha had a fight

1529
02:05:22,910 --> 02:05:24,910
Swetha left in anger

1530
02:05:25,660 --> 02:05:28,160
- Where did she go?
- Niranjana has gone in search

1531
02:05:28,580 --> 02:05:30,580
Don't know where she went

1532
02:05:33,580 --> 02:05:37,580
What? Swetha is
cycling in MG road?

1533
02:05:38,120 --> 02:05:41,120
Thooku durai, your daughter
is cycling at MG road

1534
02:05:48,450 --> 02:05:49,950
How many of you are there?

1535
02:05:50,290 --> 02:05:52,290
We are seven of us!

1536
02:05:54,160 --> 02:05:56,660
You have moved, should I come near?

1537
02:05:58,330 --> 02:06:01,580
You can slash me!
My men will fight you

1538
02:06:02,080 --> 02:06:03,580
It'll be late

1539
02:06:04,540 --> 02:06:07,750
Suleiman, open the shutter
Sir has to leave

1540
02:07:02,540 --> 02:07:04,000
Durai Uncle

1541
02:07:07,200 --> 02:07:08,200
Durai Uncle

1542
02:07:38,370 --> 02:07:39,830
Where is that girl?

1543
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:41,000
The door is locked

1544
02:07:42,200 --> 02:07:45,370
The door is locked, Break it
She is inside

1545
02:07:48,200 --> 02:07:50,200
She is here!

1546
02:07:53,660 --> 02:07:57,290
Break the door, Don't leave her!

1547
02:07:57,290 --> 02:08:00,250
She is inside, break the fan

1548
02:08:02,910 --> 02:08:07,120
She is hiding inside, don't leave her!

1549
02:09:19,160 --> 02:09:20,500
How did you come so far?

1550
02:09:20,660 --> 02:09:22,660
- Cycle
- Cycle?

1551
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:24,000
Yeah

1552
02:09:30,950 --> 02:09:32,250
Don't look this way!

1553
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:51,870
What's the time?
- 10'o clock

1554
02:10:04,370 --> 02:10:06,000
What time is the practice?

1555
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:07,500
At 7

1556
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
We shall go early?

1557
02:10:20,660 --> 02:10:22,660
Who are you?

1558
02:10:43,700 --> 02:10:46,500
How many competition have you won so far?
Around 20?

1559
02:10:46,790 --> 02:10:49,500
- 62
- Wow!

1560
02:11:09,870 --> 02:11:13,620
What's the flavor of the ice cream
we ate that day in the rain?

1561
02:11:14,790 --> 02:11:17,290
- Belgium chocolate
- Belgium chocolate

1562
02:11:25,120 --> 02:11:27,120
- Are you scared?
- Hmm

1563
02:11:28,580 --> 02:11:32,580
Your mom must be more
terrified than you are

1564
02:11:33,870 --> 02:11:35,870
Let me tell you one thing

1565
02:11:36,370 --> 02:11:38,870
Never fight with your mom

1566
02:11:40,370 --> 02:11:43,870
Never has one who fights their
mom, ever succeed in life

1567
02:11:46,870 --> 02:11:50,370
Mom!

1568
02:11:59,660 --> 02:12:00,870
Sorry mom

1569
02:12:01,870 --> 02:12:03,620
What's this new habit?

1570
02:12:04,370 --> 02:12:07,620
I've done everything
by following you

1571
02:12:09,870 --> 02:12:12,620
I've never seen you asking sorry

1572
02:12:22,870 --> 02:12:26,870
I said that I get a feeling
when I see that uncle

1573
02:12:27,620 --> 02:12:28,870
I know what it is

1574
02:12:30,870 --> 02:12:33,620
When I am with you, I feel love

1575
02:12:33,620 --> 02:12:36,370
When I am with
him, I feel secure

1576
02:12:37,870 --> 02:12:44,370
I am waving with the tides
You are the boat that keeps me afloat

1577
02:12:45,120 --> 02:12:51,620
Falling into the quicksand, I stayed to
be buried Your jewel of love saved me

1578
02:12:52,370 --> 02:12:58,370
This heart is the pendulum
between the Earth and the skies

1579
02:12:59,370 --> 02:13:06,120
The look of the eye and the slip of
the hold Keeps raising the fear in me

1580
02:13:06,870 --> 02:13:13,370
I see a peacock! I become
the rain for it to dance

1581
02:13:13,870 --> 02:13:20,620
This happiness is enough, For
me to die at this moment

1582
02:13:21,870 --> 02:13:27,870
My deary eyes! My deary eyes!
Come lean on me!

1583
02:13:29,370 --> 02:13:35,870
Soothe this wounded heart
with your blossoming hands

1584
02:13:36,620 --> 02:13:42,620
When you fall asleep, I
want to kiss your forehead

1585
02:13:43,870 --> 02:13:49,620
I stay by you and
guard your sleep

1586
02:13:50,370 --> 02:13:57,620
When the world is asleep!
I want our silence to talk

1587
02:14:04,910 --> 02:14:08,160
Neurological functions
haven't recovered completely

1588
02:14:08,660 --> 02:14:10,660
Will definitely take time

1589
02:14:11,200 --> 02:14:13,200
It might take, one,
two or three months

1590
02:14:14,160 --> 02:14:17,910
Sir, today is the last day for finals

1591
02:14:19,660 --> 02:14:23,660
It's today evening, pray that
everything should go well

1592
02:14:24,660 --> 02:14:26,910
- You are so happy!
- They are our relatives

1593
02:14:27,410 --> 02:14:29,660
- So long?
- I have many relatives

1594
02:14:30,410 --> 02:14:32,410
I have no relative, other than my mom

1595
02:14:34,660 --> 02:14:37,910
Do one thing, take all my
relative, they are jobless

1596
02:14:38,660 --> 02:14:43,160
I'll call them, call them
by the relationship,

1597
02:15:05,830 --> 02:15:08,120
All our medical reports are clear maam

1598
02:15:09,870 --> 02:15:11,870
- Let's go
- Swetha

1599
02:15:14,620 --> 02:15:16,870
- What are you doing?
- Talking to my relatives

1600
02:15:17,870 --> 02:15:20,620
Durai, come here!

1601
02:15:24,830 --> 02:15:26,830
Hello

1602
02:15:38,870 --> 02:15:40,870
Swetha!

1603
02:15:58,830 --> 02:16:02,620
Nothing happened to Swetha?

1604
02:16:07,700 --> 02:16:09,700
Swetha!

1605
02:16:31,790 --> 02:16:35,870
There is a minor concussion in the
head, leading to repeated seizures

1606
02:16:35,950 --> 02:16:39,200
There is nothing alarming but
might take some time to heal

1607
02:16:51,500 --> 02:16:55,290
The situation is not suitable,
he is not there to protect us

1608
02:16:56,080 --> 02:16:59,830
I've decided to send her to America

1609
02:17:00,160 --> 02:17:02,910
But this will make all his
efforts go down the drain

1610
02:17:04,870 --> 02:17:06,120
I've decided

1611
02:17:13,120 --> 02:17:14,120
Uncle

1612
02:17:15,250 --> 02:17:17,500
I don't know if you can hear me

1613
02:17:19,040 --> 02:17:22,250
I will never forget these
10 days I've been with you

1614
02:17:23,450 --> 02:17:26,700
As mom said, I'll go to the USA

1615
02:17:27,290 --> 02:17:30,790
My heart aches that I am not participating

1616
02:17:32,540 --> 02:17:35,040
But the pain is more

1617
02:17:36,790 --> 02:17:39,040
Looking at the pain you take for me

1618
02:17:41,620 --> 02:17:43,120
Sorry Durai Uncle

1619
02:17:50,870 --> 02:17:52,870
Mom

1620
02:17:54,080 --> 02:17:57,910
I don't need the competition

1621
02:18:15,620 --> 02:18:17,620
Stay in the car

1622
02:18:18,580 --> 02:18:21,500
Tickets, passports are all in this cover
- Did you double check?

1623
02:18:21,750 --> 02:18:23,620
- It's all in?
- Yes it is

1624
02:18:23,620 --> 02:18:25,620
Web Check-in, done?

1625
02:18:27,870 --> 02:18:29,870
What happened?

1626
02:18:46,620 --> 02:18:50,540
We will reach the stadium in 10 minutes

1627
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,540
- If mom knows,
- I'll tell her

1628
02:19:00,040 --> 02:19:02,040
Uncle, A desire

1629
02:19:02,540 --> 02:19:03,790
What is it?

1630
02:19:13,160 --> 02:19:15,160
Your girl is just like you

1631
02:19:21,120 --> 02:19:23,120
Shall we go?
- Yes

1632
02:19:23,750 --> 02:19:28,540
I'll stand at your eye
sight and encourage you

1633
02:19:37,580 --> 02:19:38,790
Where is my daughter?

1634
02:20:00,290 --> 02:20:01,700
Where is my daughter?

1635
02:20:14,660 --> 02:20:17,290
Go to the stadium

1636
02:20:32,830 --> 02:20:37,500
Niranjana, take Swetha to the stadium

1637
02:20:40,250 --> 02:20:44,700
Your one word kept me grounded for 10 years

1638
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
Now I have one thing to say

1639
02:20:51,500 --> 02:20:53,700
Take her to the stadium

1640
02:21:18,370 --> 02:21:20,370
Who is he?

1641
02:21:20,500 --> 02:21:21,750
Tell it!

1642
02:21:22,910 --> 02:21:28,410
He is dying for us, who is he?

1643
02:21:32,250 --> 02:21:37,000
How is he related?
Tell it!

1644
02:21:40,250 --> 02:21:42,950
Tell!

1645
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,250
He is your dad

1646
02:22:16,790 --> 02:22:18,500
You will win

1647
02:22:19,250 --> 02:22:22,500
Go!
GO!

1648
02:22:38,950 --> 02:22:43,790
We at Mumbai, at the
Athletics championships 2019

1649
02:22:51,700 --> 02:22:54,120
The one you hate most

1650
02:23:09,410 --> 02:23:11,410
The one I hate most

1651
02:23:12,500 --> 02:23:13,790
On your marks

1652
02:23:17,080 --> 02:23:18,540
Think them to be the floor

1653
02:23:23,290 --> 02:23:25,290
Stamp them to run

1654
02:24:59,790 --> 02:25:02,540
Swetha!
It's a fantastic victory

1655
02:25:57,700 --> 02:25:58,700
Dad!

1656
02:26:03,290 --> 02:26:04,290
Dad

1657
02:26:42,700 --> 02:26:43,700
Once more!

1658
02:26:44,750 --> 02:26:46,040
Dad!

1659
02:26:46,790 --> 02:26:48,290
Once more!

1660
02:26:51,330 --> 02:26:52,790
Dad

1661
02:26:53,700 --> 02:26:55,000
My lord

1662
02:27:32,540 --> 02:27:33,750
That's children

1663
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:36,500
What we show them

1664
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:39,500
That is their life

1665
02:27:40,700 --> 02:27:43,750
Your child didn't attempt
suicide because of her loss

1666
02:27:44,250 --> 02:27:47,290
Out of fear when you hear
about it was her concern

1667
02:27:48,250 --> 02:27:49,580
She must have taken this decision

1668
02:27:49,950 --> 02:27:51,950
Those below 18 years

1669
02:27:52,660 --> 02:27:54,660
If a child commits suicide

1670
02:27:55,040 --> 02:27:57,040
It's no suicide

1671
02:27:57,290 --> 02:27:59,290
It's a murder

1672
02:28:00,040 --> 02:28:02,040
I am not educated as you are

1673
02:28:02,290 --> 02:28:03,290
But I know one thing well

1674
02:28:04,540 --> 02:28:06,790
We bring our children to this world

1675
02:28:07,540 --> 02:28:08,790
Not from us

1676
02:28:09,290 --> 02:28:10,540
Not for us

1677
02:28:11,160 --> 02:28:14,200
Our passion, our dreams, our loss

1678
02:28:15,540 --> 02:28:17,290
Should never be a burden for them

1679
02:28:18,790 --> 02:28:20,040
Let them grow

1680
02:28:20,790 --> 02:28:22,040
Happily

1681
02:28:22,540 --> 02:28:23,790
As children

1682
02:28:24,540 --> 02:28:27,790
The winner is Swetha Thooku Durai

1683
02:29:23,700 --> 02:29:31,700
OUR PAST AND FUTURE NEED NOT BE THRUST TO
OUR CHILDREN LET THEM ENJOY LIFE AS A CHILD

1684
