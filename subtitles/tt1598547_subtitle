1
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:31,521
We are reaching.

2
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,719
Did you call me?

3
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,122
l haven't called you. Gutter has called.

4
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:40,428
l have seen in the newspaper that
there would be rain for days.

5
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:42,396
But l thought it won't be rain.

6
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:44,194
One more thing.

7
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:45,894
You stop the vehicle
at the nextjunction.

8
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:46,936
For asking the route.

9
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:54,069
Madhavan, who is mad to buy
this bull from boss for Rs.7,000?

10
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,679
This is not a common bull.

11
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:57,440
lt belongs to a special category.

12
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,242
Boss tells that always.

13
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,977
Whatever it is, its job is that.

14
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,188
Oh! lt's good time.

15
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:17,892
Madhavan, l think the vehicle
is trapped in this mud.

16
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:31,176
That is Asia Vision's vehicle.
Let them go.

17
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:32,009
Okay.

18
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:33,619
Go. Go.

19
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,989
Look at the size of this.

20
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:41,387
Looks like the bulls
in Greek stories.

21
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:44,791
Oh!

22
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,459
Mother, l think you are
enjoying the rain.

23
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,462
Are you going to write any poem?

24
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,903
The time for Malayalees to enjoy
the beauty of rain is over.

25
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:01,011
l was thinking that how many megawatt of
electricity can be produced from this rain.

26
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:02,181
Oh!

27
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:05,346
Kumar, if the rain continues
like this, then what will

28
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:07,213
happen to the " one day''
of day after tomorrow.

29
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,819
You don't speak negatively.

30
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,354
After a long time Kochi has got
one lndia-Australia match.

31
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:13,253
That too the series decider.

32
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:17,729
After so many years,
there is no change in this place.

33
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:20,625
We are reaching the school.

34
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:42,854
This is famous poet Nirmala Varghese.

35
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:49,958
Asia Vision channel is doing a programme
on Nirmala's teaching profession.

36
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:55,627
Teacher's daughter and Asia Vision's reporter
Bedsy is doing the programme.

37
00:03:56,469 --> 00:04:03,375
Teacher had taught in
our school 25 years back.

38
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:12,712
Because of that, our school is going to
become famous through Asia Vision channel.

39
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,192
Hello, l am counsellor Papachan.

40
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:26,529
Here, shooting is going on so my mobile
will be switched off for some time.

41
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:27,791
l just called.

42
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,729
Mother, let's take
Father Paul's scene here.

43
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,167
And counsellor Papachan's scene
in that classroom.

44
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:34,670
ln between, l will take yours also.

45
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:41,074
My children Johny Kutty and Molamma
whom you taught are in Australia.

46
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:44,650
Look! This snap was taken when
they came for last vacation.

47
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:46,842
lf you want, you can show
this on TV.

48
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:48,611
l will speak about them also.

49
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:50,482
This would be a credit for teacher.

50
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:57,260
l will show this,
but there is a small problem.

51
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,522
lf people feel that it
is self-boasting,

52
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,632
Then they will change the channel.
- Okay.

53
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:05,634
They all don't know that Planter Punnoose
is a big fellow as we know.

54
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:07,601
Yes. That is correct.
- Yes.

55
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,040
l am fed up of the people
in my party.

56
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:13,303
l have promised them that l will
tell all the activities which..

57
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:17,176
l have done for this school while
speaking about teacher.

58
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:20,412
The full road has been damaged
due to rain, at that time

59
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,248
you are building bus stand
for keeping the name board

60
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:25,617
" Member Papachan has
built this bus stand.''

61
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,190
Leader, is that development?

62
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:29,993
lf we can't run bus through the road,
then what is the use of the stand?

63
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:33,131
Government, for cheap publicity,
is giving rice for Rs.2..

64
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,825
to the people who don't have money
to buy kerosene for Rs.9, right?

65
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:38,965
What is the use of rice if they
can't light their stove?

66
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:42,039
lf you say something about state government,
then l will pierce your stomach.

67
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:43,868
Sudharkaran. Look.
l am saying.

68
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,271
Don't make any problem.

69
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:47,804
What about the elephant shed?
Did Kalyani deliver?

70
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:48,480
You tell me that.

71
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:52,879
No one tries to shine here on TV by
speaking about our elephant's delivery.

72
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:54,779
Teacher, please come.
Master, come.

73
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:55,715
Come.

74
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,424
l am the joint secretary of
Toddy Shop Employee Union.

75
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:04,527
This is Master Elias.

76
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:05,493
Branch secretary of this place.

77
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:06,790
Teacher knows that.

78
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,430
This is for the first time in this place,
shooting is taking place.

79
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:14,766
Because of that, we will forget the matter that
media is the right hand of capitalists.

80
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:18,774
But if you show Papachan on TV,
then you should also show master Elias.

81
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:21,310
This is not the policy of the party.

82
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:22,776
But for party..

83
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,878
lf it is for party, then no problem.

84
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:28,542
Counsellor Papachan is coming in this
programme as ex-student of teacher.

85
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:29,915
And not..
- Dear.

86
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:32,057
l know Elias master.

87
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,918
lnclude him too.
- That's enough.

88
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:34,923
That's enough.

89
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:43,294
On the path of the temple who stands
with the glory of morning sun.

90
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,702
Father, are you studying poem
after closing this room?

91
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:53,139
Not poem.

92
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,871
l was studying the dialogue which l have
to speak about teacher on the TV.

93
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,879
About teacher?
The one l heard just now?

94
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:58,778
Yes!

95
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:06,153
Chief minister, bishops, film stars, etc.
will listen to what l say on the TV.

96
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,725
l don't want to be inferior
in front of them.

97
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:09,622
Father.

98
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:11,490
Did you tell those channel
people about Mathai?

99
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:12,891
No! l haven't got time.

100
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,532
Father.
- Yes!

101
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,634
They are searching you for shooting.

102
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:18,831
Come!

103
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,064
Hello. Hello.
Kumar.

104
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:25,268
Father. Let's start.
- Yes.

105
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,870
Before that, teacher,
you come here.

106
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,817
l will give you a nice person
for this programme.

107
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:35,053
Mathews.

108
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:38,319
Teacher, you had taught him.
- Father, now itself here..

109
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:42,594
Mathews is not a person like these people
who are eager to show their face on TV.

110
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,423
l have told him about
this programme.

111
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:46,927
Then too, he hadn't agreed.

112
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,097
But if you get Mathai then the
programme will be successful.

113
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:53,936
Sudhir is a close friend of Mathews.

114
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,473
lf he is useful for the programme,
then l am ready to make him agree.

115
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:58,769
But Father, you do one thing.

116
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,775
Tell him to come here.

117
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,341
We can't bring Mathai here.

118
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:04,675
He is having a farmhouse there.
We can shoot there.

119
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:08,678
After finishing the shooting here,
Sudhir will take you there.

120
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:12,152
Teacher will understand everything
after reaching there.

121
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:43,749
Look. Mathews.

122
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:44,786
Stop. Stop.

123
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,427
No.

124
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:49,888
No, no.

125
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,027
Don't show any of your action to me.

126
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:56,463
l have seen lot of people like you.

127
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,068
You only like that Pandi Manikan.

128
00:08:58,271 --> 00:08:59,738
Other men are also here.

129
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,067
Come here.

130
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,936
lf l come there, then l will do
what l shouldn't do.

131
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:04,905
Mathai.

132
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,577
Oh! You.

133
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:10,406
Hey! Come here.

134
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:12,341
Hey! Come here.

135
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:22,090
Nirmala teacher, right?
- Yes.

136
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:26,194
Teacher and her daughter were ready
to run hearing your dialogues.

137
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,457
l..

138
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,961
Teacher, don't think that your student
has become so degraded.

139
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,201
One bull was here, Manikan.

140
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,306
lt became old and l have sold
that to a farmer.

141
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,536
lnstead of that, today, l brought
one bull named Muthu from Wyanad.

142
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,541
For reproduction,
all these are not needed.

143
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,145
An injection is available
in veterinary hospital.

144
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:45,806
But for this..
How will l tell all that to teacher?

145
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:54,549
That...they also need not
natural enjoyments.

146
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,389
But she...
Mollykutty has run away.

147
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,062
l am not treating them as animals.

148
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,065
l am behaving with them like this.
l am so close to them.

149
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,162
Oh! Are you standing here?

150
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,067
When l saw she is running
after seeing the new bull, l..

151
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,570
..have run till the road through
Aluva Chandi's place thinking..

152
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:17,411
..that it may die by colliding
with some lorry.- Okay. Okay.

153
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:23,012
Last time when it ran away,
that time you brought sari and blouse.

154
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,757
This time you have brought people itself.
- Hey, go man.

155
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:26,921
Mollykutty.
- Go.

156
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,855
Mollykutty, come,
the bull is waiting for you.

157
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:30,525
Hey, Mollykutty.

158
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,759
Mathai, who are these people?

159
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,264
These...
- Asia Vision vehicle is also there.

160
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,937
Come fast.
Now itself we are late.

161
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,770
We have to reach the church before marriage.
- Please go, please go.

162
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,870
Don't make your daughter-in-law angry.
Please go.

163
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,771
One marriage is being held in the church.
They are going for that.

164
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,948
Mathai, they have come here
for shooting.

165
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:53,607
l have told Father Paul that
all these are not necessary.

166
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,617
Teacher thinks that you have come
to visit an old student's house.

167
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,449
Please don't force me
for shooting.

168
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,454
Don't think anything else.

169
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,123
We have come here because Father
Paul told us to come here.- Okay.

170
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:04,793
Let me see if there is
any stuff for shooting.

171
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,458
l will force you after that.

172
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:10,967
Come.

173
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:49,971
Please come.

174
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:08,156
This is my father.
He is my guru in farming.

175
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,487
l have put my father's name
for this farm - Jermias.

176
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:11,663
Nirmala teacher.

177
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,670
How many varieties of cows are here?
- Around 150.

178
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:30,508
Sunandini, Jersey, Swiss brown.
Almost all varieties are here.- Oh! Mother.

179
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:34,451
Mother, what is this?
They will do all these.

180
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:38,115
Oh! lf they alone will do,
lt won't be neat.

181
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:46,023
This is Mathew's old Nirmala teacher
and her daughter.

182
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:47,795
You people talk.

183
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,696
l will wash my hand and face, then
l will take something to drink.- Okay.

184
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,369
l am also having some work.

185
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:02,644
This is your new bull, right?
We have seen it on the way.

186
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:06,316
You haven't shot it by feeling that
it has a stuff for shooting right?

187
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,988
He is an expert.

188
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:16,321
lf you show on TV, the people who have
cows will come here in search of him.

189
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,556
Hey. come

190
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:21,399
Here.

191
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:22,726
Yes.

192
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:26,333
Now, Muthumani is the star here.

193
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:29,064
This is only one week old, right?
- Yes!

194
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:32,075
Go drink milk.

195
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:35,743
Do you know about cows?

196
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,080
ln my father's house,
there was a small farm.

197
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:40,912
When l go to the village for vacation,
then l always be with cows.

198
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,178
Mother, right?
- Yes!

199
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:45,755
Why did you keep the
tape recorder here?

200
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,084
Are you milking the cow
by listening to music?

201
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:48,760
This is not for us.
This is for cows.

202
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,761
Does cow enjoy music?

203
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:57,000
lf we put some music, then we can
see their enjoyment by observing them.

204
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:58,201
That's right.

205
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,598
While listening to the song
Only flower for keeping there...

206
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:04,776
..our Annie cow has jumped
into the plant with flowers.

207
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:07,275
Then it has left only one
flower in the plant.

208
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:10,778
Hey, go fill the tank instead of
sitting here idle like this. Go.

209
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:18,282
This is the waste of beer.
What waste?

210
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:21,287
l used to give this to the cow
along with cattle food.

211
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:26,858
Good morning, teacher.

212
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:29,795
l am his mother's only sister.

213
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:33,028
My son Bobby is in Vietnam
with his family.

214
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:39,967
l am having a huge house in town.
But no one is there to speak with me.

215
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,305
That's why Bobby dropped me here.

216
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:43,640
Hey! Bob.- Yes.
- Where is Lucia?

217
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:50,488
l will allow some tourists who are
interested in farming to stay here.

218
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:52,816
Both of them have fought again.

219
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:56,424
They are like small children.
Let me solve their problem.- Okay.

220
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:59,325
Let's go to the farm.
- Lucia. Come. Come.

221
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:00,998
Yes. l am coming.
- Come here.

222
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,061
One minute. l am just coming.
- Okay.

223
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:09,007
After eating stomach full of milk
and giving lot of milk. Okay.

224
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,106
Which is the category?

225
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,235
When l was small,
my father had sent me here.

226
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:15,674
After that, he hadn't come
to see me.

227
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:18,611
That's why l couldn't ask him
which category l belong to.

228
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,187
l asked you about this nutmeg tree.

229
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,785
You have asked the right person.

230
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:29,026
This nutmeg tree belongs
to Vishwas.

231
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:33,861
Son, you put fumes for nutmeg
tree after two days because of rain.

232
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,035
Buttermilk.

233
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:39,362
Take.

234
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,640
This.- This is neighbour
Sudhakaran's wife Lata.

235
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:45,707
We have seen him in the school.
Master Sudhakaran.

236
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:48,706
Sudhakaran doesn't have time
after his party work.

237
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:50,811
She and her child would
be always here.

238
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:54,109
l haven't seen Mathew's wife
and children.

239
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,930
l was behind all this.
l haven't got time to get married.

240
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:12,331
But it will happen soon.
We are seriously looking for that.

241
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:14,937
My son Bobby's wife's family
is also searching.

242
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,768
You go inside, otherwise,
you will fall in this like last time. Go!

243
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:22,436
While marrying see whether
she is having any disease.

244
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:25,946
By seeing the new bull,
l felt that the bride coming here..

245
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,778
..would only have time to
run behind the cows.

246
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,785
Hey, go fill the tank and
cut grasses too. Go.

247
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,455
He doesn't know what to talk
and when to talk.

248
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:38,691
What is that?

249
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:39,959
That..

250
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,626
Electricity is available here like
rat coming to eat tapioca.

251
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:43,961
lt will come and go fast.

252
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:47,297
So, l thought l will produce the electricity
needed for the farm here itself.

253
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,903
Oh! lt's great.
l want to shoot this.

254
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:55,971
l will force you for that.

255
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,915
What Father Paul has said is true.

256
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:02,312
Nirmala teacher can always
be proud of this disciple.

257
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:13,888
Earlier, my father had started
a farm here after taking loan..

258
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,431
..from state financial corporation.

259
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,736
When he couldn't repay the debt,
SFC had taken over this land.

260
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,502
That time l was studying
in school.

261
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,843
That time teacher had given
one composition about who..

262
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,672
..you want to become
in future.

263
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,515
Everyone had written that they wanted
to become doctor and engineer.

264
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,684
That time l had written that
l want to become an owner..

265
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,284
..of a farm which contains
a lot of cows.

266
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:40,584
A small boy after seeing my father
staying in a small rented..

267
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:43,861
..house ashamed of facing
people and selling milk..

268
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,691
..produced in the house could have
wished only that much right?

269
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,026
That day you had scolded me not
for writing about wishing..

270
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,531
..to study and going forjob.

271
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:53,361
You had marked that
composition with red ink.

272
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:58,374
You were an intelligent student.
That's why that time l had..

273
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,704
Teacher, your words had
given me more strength.

274
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:07,451
That's why after completing 10th standard,
l had worked and taken back this place.

275
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:10,987
Teacher, you come.

276
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,728
l have kept that composition till now.

277
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,729
Kumar, you take the camera.
Let's start this story from here.

278
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:25,734
My Bedsy. l can call her
like that, right?

279
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:29,238
When l feel like crying, l would
like to cry without seeing anyone.

280
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:33,741
l am not interested in boasting
my problems to become hero.

281
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:34,738
Okay.

282
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:38,505
lf Mathew doesn't want to speak anything
about his personal life, then it's okay.

283
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:42,483
But other people should know
that there is a farm like this.

284
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:46,087
l want to do a programme about
this farm once.- Okay.

285
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:47,688
You can do that.
- Okay.

286
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,930
We thought that you
might have gone.

287
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,929
Kalyani has given birth to twins.
- Twins?

288
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,439
He is speaking about
the elephant Kalyani.

289
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,675
Elephants rarely give birth to twins.

290
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:07,511
Then we will shoot it exclusively
and show in the news hour.

291
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:11,274
When you say that on TV, then you
tell that it is because of my calibre.

292
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,110
What? About elephant's delivery?

293
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:16,112
Not that. About the elephant's
rest house made here.

294
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:31,961
Come!

295
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:36,798
My daughter was a CEO of
an lT company in Bangalore.

296
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,873
She has taken up a governmentjob here..
..because of our wish.

297
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,314
She is our only child.

298
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:52,586
She doesn't look aged.
But she is 32 years old.

299
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:55,154
l could hide that.

300
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,220
This is not the occasion
to hide anything.

301
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:05,832
His demand is also that the
bride should be above 30.

302
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:08,336
Please have tea.
- Oh, yes.

303
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,568
l can drink a lot of tea from
here in future too.

304
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,409
Before that, let the bride
and groom speak.

305
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:21,586
What happened?
Don't want it?- Okay.

306
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:34,898
As Maria's father said, this is not
the occasion to hide truth.

307
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:39,667
For a marriage,
a lot of things should match.

308
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:41,805
That's why l am little late
for marriage.

309
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,575
Can l say everything openly to Maria?
- Yes.

310
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:49,012
My decision is that l will marry
a suitable person only.

311
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:52,008
l am very frank.
You can speak to me freely.

312
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:59,246
My family is very big comprised
of my father mother and aunt.

313
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:04,091
My wife should look
after all of them.

314
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:08,930
ln my office, l am managing
12 people.- Okay.

315
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:10,101
That's not a problem for me.

316
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:14,261
l haven't meant that.
l own one farmhouse.

317
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:15,770
Did the broker tell that?
- Yes.

318
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:21,274
For looking after all that,
Maria may have to leave the job.

319
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:26,614
The work in the farmhouse is more
interesting than the office work.

320
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:27,944
l will give surety for that.

321
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,879
l don't have any problem
in leaving the job.

322
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:37,224
For looking after the love birds,
garden and swimming pool in..

323
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:41,622
..the farmhouse, is it necessary
to leave the job?

324
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:45,792
This farmhouse is not
what you are thinking.

325
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:50,307
Farming in three acres of land
and 150 cows.

326
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,043
Cows?
- Yes!

327
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:57,143
You have to give food to them in time,
clean their shed and..

328
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:59,874
..you should help
in milking the cow.

329
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:01,914
When one work is over,
another will crop up.

330
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,214
l have told you that the life
with cows is very interesting.

331
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:06,421
Very sorry.

332
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,923
l don't like the dirty smell of cows.

333
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:13,824
lf you don't like me, then tell me that.
Don't speak nonsense about cows.

334
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:19,496
l am giving my opinion.
l hate cows.

335
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:24,333
You consume milk daily, right?
Cow is giving that. Do you hate that?

336
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:27,102
l haven't said that you don't
stay with cows.

337
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:29,939
l said it's not possible for me.
For that, why are you getting angry?

338
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:34,516
You should keep your manners
while talking about that good animal.

339
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:39,948
Government is giving salary monthly for you
because of those animals and people like us.

340
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:43,184
You are not ashamed to take that.
And saying you hate cows.

341
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:45,253
That's why you are still in your
house without marrying.

342
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:56,537
You shouldn't have told
that much to the girl.

343
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:58,539
l should give one slap to you
and not to her.

344
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:03,275
l have told you 100 times that l need
a girl who is ready to look after my farm.

345
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:08,284
You have told me that girl will leave
the job when she hears about the farm.

346
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:11,385
Hey, when l saw her photo
l thought that she is a nice girl.

347
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:14,551
Whatever is there in the mind,
they won't show it on the face.

348
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,057
That is the smartness of ladies.

349
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:19,955
She has the face of a cow.
That's why l liked her.

350
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:27,231
l have told you that in each wheat
grain, it is written he should eat it.

351
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:30,064
Anyway, she is not in my wheat grain.

352
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:33,238
She hates cow.

353
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,412
Hey, that girl working
in channel, Bedsy.

354
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:39,917
She told you that she
likes cows, right?

355
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:42,320
ls she there in your wheat grain?

356
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:46,752
For you, broker's job is suited
more that the job in lorry.

357
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:51,258
Coming with the other one so fast.
Wheat grain. Coconut bunch.

358
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:53,189
Loves cow.

359
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:55,065
The district collector
Sandhya Ramachandran has..

360
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,996
..inaugurated the distribution of
five cent land's document..

361
00:23:57,202 --> 00:24:00,330
..for the people below poverty level
at Vaipin in Eranakulam.

362
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:07,243
Government has given the
2.5 acres of land near Vaipin.

363
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,978
Did Lucia understand anything?

364
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,481
What is it, Mathews?

365
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,412
Our government is giving land
to the poor people.

366
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,744
Oh! That's great.

367
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:21,584
What?
- Nothing like that.

368
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:26,087
Kalyani elephant in the Kodanad elephant
rest house has given birth for twins.

369
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,358
Our correspondent Bedsy Varghese
from the elephant..

370
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:32,762
rest house in Kodanad with the exclusive
news which only Asia Vision has got.

371
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,603
Kalyani has given birth for
twins in the elephant's

372
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,503
rest house under forest
department at Kodanad, a..

373
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:42,111
..village near Periyar river which
is 50kms away from Ernakulan.

374
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,941
The incident took place
in yesterday afternoon.

375
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:50,451
The villagers have welcomed
this surprising incident happily.

376
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:55,615
This village is only 16 kms away
from Nedumbassery airport.

377
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,954
All the heroes in the village are there.

378
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,855
Which time l felt to go for marriage?

379
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:05,635
lf you haven't gone,
then your picture would come in..

380
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,134
..TV with description that you are
admitted to the hospital..

381
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:10,206
..because your daughter-in-law
has beaten you with something.

382
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,636
For Asia Vision,
Bedsy Varghese from Kodanadu.

383
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,811
There is a big queue of VlP to watch
the lndia-Australia match in Kochi.

384
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,075
This news will be there after the break.

385
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:28,051
Nirapara Sambar.
Pure vegetarian Sambar (gruel).

386
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:29,893
Good swelling is there.

387
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:33,328
He won't listen to me when l tell
him not to run in the farm.

388
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:36,262
Hey, Elsa, lf l run here and
there in the farm then only..

389
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:38,493
..in the evening you will
massage my legs.

390
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,832
Let our son marry someone
by seeing that.

391
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,339
Father, let my tiredness
of seeing that girl get over.

392
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:47,506
l am going to the cow shed.

393
00:25:57,455 --> 00:26:00,356
Now, she is six months pregnant.
Let's start giving fish oil.- Okay.

394
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,253
Mathai.

395
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:04,458
What happened, Abdu?

396
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:07,323
After the news about Kalyani
has come in the TV..

397
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:10,791
..everyone is saying that a lot of people
will come to see the elephant's rest house.

398
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:14,737
Tomorrow onwards, l need two more
litres of milk in my shop.

399
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,407
What about the pending
payment of milk?

400
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:19,900
l will give you after my business
flourishes.- Okay.

401
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:24,078
Mathews, you won't agree.

402
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:26,340
Otherwise l will mix cattle food
in the milk for debtors.

403
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:29,084
lf his business doesn't flourish,
the milk will flourish.- Mathew.

404
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:33,087
That Krovli is making noise there.
That..where you have kept that?

405
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:36,391
lt is under my coat.
- Then tell me clearly.

406
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:42,928
Why are you developing a bad habit in
your father by giving brandy on Saturdays?

407
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:45,369
lf you want, you make me bad.

408
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,604
This is not related to
developing bad habit.

409
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:51,941
This is for spending some
good time with his friend.

410
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:57,445
l am giving him an opportunity
to sing some songs if he is happy.

411
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:01,611
lf small happiness like this wasn't
there, then what is life?

412
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:06,389
Good morning.
- Yes. Good morning.

413
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:13,889
l was busy with church and school.

414
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:16,630
That's why l haven't come
here in between.

415
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:21,065
What about the proposal of Mullathara
Sebastian's daughter for Mathai.

416
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:24,540
Father, that girl is not smart.

417
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:28,470
Father, you have seen her after
the novena in the church.

418
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,649
That's why she looked sleepy.
- Don't play with my novena.

419
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:36,643
lf that marriage proposal wasn't ready,
then why does Elsamma want to see me?

420
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:40,916
l told you that we have brought
a new bull.

421
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:44,326
But it was sick from the
day it came here.

422
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:46,154
That's mainly because of its mind.

423
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:51,668
Father, you please pray for that.

424
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:01,503
Hey, no problem, know?
- No. No problem. Give me that umbrella.

425
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:03,840
lt was not adjusted to this atmosphere.

426
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:14,522
Hey, Lord, who has cured the leper..
Who has given vision for the blind..

427
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:17,024
Who has listened to the
request of good thief..

428
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:19,025
Jesus.

429
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:21,194
This loving..

430
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:23,193
What is its name?
- Muthu.

431
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:30,398
Okay. Cure this bull named Muthu.
- Mathai.

432
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:36,036
You told me that you will come to see
the farm and you are coming now.

433
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:39,216
Agriculture officers have more
file work than field work.

434
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:41,382
Sir, you come.

435
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:43,880
You please cure him.

436
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:48,886
What is going on there?
- They are praying.- Okay.

437
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:55,828
Hey, l don't believe that you
are doing organic farming.

438
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:58,827
How do you get high yield without
using chemical manure?

439
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:02,006
Sir, is it because of chemical manure that
the trees in the forest are growing nicely?

440
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:06,737
Nature itself has given the materials needed
for aintaining life. That itself is enough.

441
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:15,084
Look this. Baby variety
See its size.

442
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:17,254
l have put only earthworm
compost for this.

443
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:18,748
Sir!

444
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:23,754
l liked it. Are you selling this?

445
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:26,590
Sir, for buying snake-gourd,
you shouldn't have come here.

446
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:28,595
lf you phoned me,
l could have sent that.

447
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:31,593
l am not asking about snake gourd.
l am asking about this land.

448
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:36,199
One good party has come.
You will get good price for this.

449
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:40,368
Sir, what you are saying?
- l have forgotten to introduce them.

450
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:43,274
He is assistant engineer in
irrigation department.- Hello.

451
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:46,108
He is the superintendent of
soil research institute.

452
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:49,285
What we can do with the salary
which the government is giving us.

453
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:54,857
Now, we are into real estate.
Property business. You tell me.

454
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,025
How much do you want
for this land?

455
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:02,965
Sir, how could you ask after
seeing this farming land?

456
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:05,962
How much you will get by selling
this tapioca and bitter gourd?

457
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:07,297
Price is for land.

458
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:09,632
You take a decision and
tell me. l will call you.

459
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:10,975
Father.
- Yes!

460
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:12,905
See you.
- Okay. Okay.

461
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:15,143
That is Aluva Chandi's land.

462
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:20,873
The officer who has come instead
of Gangadharan sir..

463
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:24,316
..who worked for agricultural
development. Very good.

464
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:26,890
People should beat him with belt.

465
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:30,921
Came to buy this heaven. Devils.

466
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:40,498
Your milk is having very less point.
l don't take this.

467
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:52,010
Sir, the fat of the milk will be
reduced due to the mental..

468
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:56,683
..situation of the cow before milking
and also due to the climatic conditions.

469
00:30:56,888 --> 00:31:00,016
Without knowing that this poor
fellow must have added some water.

470
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:03,883
ln this state, milk is coming
from Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh..

471
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:05,825
... after adding chemical.
Comparing to that, this is not a major issue.

472
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:07,123
lf you have come to sell milk,
then you do that.

473
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:09,197
Don't come and give me
a lecture about milk.

474
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:12,695
l have told you about a matter
which you don't know and l know.

475
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:14,030
For that, why are you getting angry?

476
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:16,202
lf l become angry,
what will you do?

477
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:18,375
l will also say something
which smells like manure.

478
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:21,545
Do you want to hear that?
- What is this, Mathews? Come here.

479
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,713
l wanted to give him two slaps
for quite a long time.

480
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:27,146
Government has kept him here to
protest the farmers and for ill treating.

481
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:29,047
Tell him to go.
- l will find a solution for everything.

482
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:31,552
What solution will you find?
- Some solution is there. You come.

483
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:34,883
Brother Mathai.
- Yes.

484
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:37,394
This is my friend Jose.
- He has come to meet you.- Hello.

485
00:31:37,762 --> 00:31:39,730
l have come here as per
Aluva Chandi sir said.- Okay.

486
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:41,899
The land behind you belongs
to Chandi Sir, right?- Yes.

487
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,068
What price will you sell your land for?

488
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:45,666
Sell?

489
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:47,738
ls this the solution which
you told me to make?

490
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:51,466
lf you sell that farm, then no need
to come and fight here like this.

491
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:53,572
This time the price of land
has come down.

492
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:55,311
That means time for buying land.
- Okay.

493
00:31:55,713 --> 00:32:00,412
Chandi Sir will give you
high price for your land.

494
00:32:00,618 --> 00:32:03,815
Hey, l have heard that this Aluva Chandi
is a big real estate businessman.

495
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:06,751
My land is for cultivation
and not for selling.

496
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:10,086
Go and tell your Chandi that
l am not planning to sell my land.

497
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:13,355
Oh! Won't give peace to people.
ls this your solution?

498
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:23,107
Chandi Sir. Came.

499
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,268
Don't forget to ask.

500
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:30,777
You ask him whether he needs some
other land in the shore of Periyar. -Okay.

501
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:32,950
Hello, Mr. Chandi.
What happened to my property?

502
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:33,617
Tell. Tell.

503
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:35,615
Colonel, can you look for some
other place by the riverside?

504
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:36,954
Are you joking?

505
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:39,214
l made it very clear that
l need that place.

506
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,891
That lovely corner place
near the riverside.

507
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:42,616
lf you can't do it, return my advance.

508
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:46,456
He wants that land itself.
Otherwise return his advance.

509
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:49,459
Oh!
- Okay, sir.

510
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:52,298
Please give me one month more.

511
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:54,634
Okay. Done.

512
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:57,133
Oh!
Come.

513
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,016
Bye.

514
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:15,091
Hey, Mishra is having underworld
connection in Mumbai.

515
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:18,424
After signing the MOU and
taking 75 lakhs advance,

516
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:21,496
lf you cheat him, then underworld
goons will come here with guns.

517
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:22,591
Oh!

518
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:28,602
Gun is something that looks
like this, right?

519
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:35,836
Hey! Five acres of land which
l have shown is with me.

520
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:40,378
He also wants that four acres of land
near to the river, right?- Yes!

521
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:45,284
Tell him that he should give more
amount than the agreed amount,

522
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:46,621
because that land is very costly.

523
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:51,056
Hey, Brother, this Mishra has
brought land in lot of tourist places.

524
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:55,392
He become surprised by seeing
that farmhouse and land.

525
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:58,736
Money is not a problem for him.
But he wants that land.

526
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:29,190
Brother, where is blacksmith
Gopalan's house?

527
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,196
Blacksmith Gopalan!
Blacksmith Gopalan's house..

528
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:37,136
Dear. Dear.
Don't go to people who don't like you.

529
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:41,045
Sorry, he doesn't know. Cow.

530
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:50,713
She doesn't like cows.

531
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:56,953
Hello!

532
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:02,564
ln our land?

533
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:11,897
First pillar will come here.
The second pillar comes in the building.

534
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:13,569
Entrance is through here.

535
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,081
Hey! What?
Who are these people?

536
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,912
These are Aluva Chandi's people.

537
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:26,745
Why are you measuring my land?
Take and go.

538
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:33,087
You have to destroy little agriculture land.

539
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:36,027
Back side is okay.
How is the frontage?- Okay.

540
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:39,431
Destroy my agriculture? This is my land.
What are you doing here?

541
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,765
l am going to buy this land.

542
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,874
l have already told him that
l won't sell this land.

543
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:46,935
One more thing.

544
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:50,444
lf you come here to show your rowdism,
you won't go from here properly.

545
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:55,617
Mathews, what is this?

546
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,947
lf l need land, then how can
l remain without buying it?

547
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:02,286
Not only this, l will buy all
the nearby lands.

548
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:09,623
lf l get this three acre, 60 cent land of
that house and 40 cent of the other house,

549
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:14,635
then my 5 acre land in the backside will..
..get 4 acre riverside frontage.

550
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:18,240
lf l get everything, then a fellow
from Mumbai will buy..

551
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:22,045
..all these lands and built
a five star hotel here.

552
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,144
lf it happens so..

553
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:26,815
l have five more plots in this area.

554
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:30,476
Some other people have agreed
to build a big hospital..

555
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:36,320
..engineering college and
shopping complex there also.

556
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:41,163
Thus Kodanad is going
to become a township.

557
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:44,823
Do that in your land.
This is my land. My livelihood.

558
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:46,327
Wants to build hotel.

559
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,934
Even if it is magistrate's son,
he won't build anything here.

560
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:53,270
Mathews, now l am ready to buy
this land at a higher price.

561
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:58,078
Otherwise you will come to me
for selling this at half price.

562
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,115
Otherwise l will bring you for that.

563
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:03,419
You decide which one is needed.

564
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:05,520
Sir, please wait.

565
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:07,754
There is nothing to think.

566
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:13,789
Some insect's attack usually
happens here.

567
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:17,195
l used to spray garlic water or
tobacco syrup for that. That's all.

568
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:18,364
Don't try to threaten me. You go.

569
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,866
Let's see.
- Okay. Let's see.

570
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:21,638
Jose!

571
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:24,940
Aluva Chandi is not
as silly as you think.

572
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:26,575
We should block him in
the beginning itself.

573
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:27,972
Otherwise it would be a problem.

574
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:36,543
l felt angry when l heard that
one incident like this..

575
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,048
..happened in the precinct of my station.

576
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:42,050
You don't worry.
l am here.

577
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,323
Come!

578
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,728
Sahavuddin, one chair.

579
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,060
Why he came here?
- Good morning, sir.

580
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,896
You have given complaint
about him, right?

581
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,503
Then his presence is needed here.

582
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:58,403
Hey! Your hooliganism won't work here.

583
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:01,571
How much can you give him?
You tell that.

584
00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:09,750
There Rs.7,000 is for one cent.
l will give him Rs.10,000

585
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:14,084
Yes! That is a good rate.
What you are saying?

586
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:17,919
Sir, are you sitting here to file
case or for property business?

587
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,264
DYSP. Rajan sir.

588
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:23,861
Sir. Prabhakaran here.
Yes, l will do.

589
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,099
Okay, sir. Okay.

590
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:32,098
ln our place Rs.1000 percent
is a good price.- Stop it.

591
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,436
Are you teasing us?

592
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:37,603
You put him inside and charge case.
- Sudhakaran, don't get angry.

593
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:43,048
Sudhakaran, you have gone with the
culprits after locking me in the jail.

594
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:46,779
But what can l do if DYSP
says something?

595
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:52,061
lt is very difficult to make a
new house after selling the house.

596
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:56,131
You give them little more.
- SP. Venu Sir.

597
00:38:56,567 --> 00:39:00,128
Sir. Okay, sir.
Everything is okay, sir.

598
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:01,402
Okay, sir.

599
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:04,966
Look. l am having lot of work here.

600
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:08,478
l will tell him to give Rs.500 more percent.

601
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:09,475
No, sir.

602
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:13,648
You take that Rs.500 as commission,
thinking that this deal has taken place.

603
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:15,415
Hey. Hey.

604
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:18,747
Don't be in high spirit thinking that
a party worker is with you.

605
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:20,821
This is not because of the
backup of a party worker.

606
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:25,151
When we come to know that
the police can't do anything..

607
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:27,556
..to a person who has done hooliganism
after coming to our house,

608
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:28,665
then the owner of that house
will show his anger.

609
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,163
Sir, you won't understand that.

610
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:54,353
Hey! ln the lands of Aluva Chandi, he has
kept the board of hotel, hospital and college.

611
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:58,851
That means what Chandi said about
the town bishop is true right?

612
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:02,460
Lorence, not town bishop.
lt is township.

613
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:05,464
When l told you that Chandi is
not lying, what did you say?

614
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:07,694
l am saying this for getting
people in my resort, right?

615
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:08,872
Now, what happened?

616
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:12,535
Are you standing here
without going for work?

617
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,210
Hey. Township is going
to come here.

618
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:18,041
Who wants that work in Madom?
- Hey! What is this township?

619
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,546
This township means..

620
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,049
That means..

621
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:26,655
When five-star hotel and college
will come, the people here will getjob.

622
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:29,382
Business will develop.
Roads will develop.

623
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,389
Bridge will link here with airport.
A lot of people will come.

624
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,394
The price of the land here will increase.

625
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,397
Then the status of this village
and our status will change.

626
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:43,562
Some of the fools believed that
thus Kodanad will become a heaven.

627
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:45,571
But that is not the truth.

628
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:49,344
Township means the
attack of capitalist.

629
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:53,677
That will destroy our agriculture
and the beauty of the village.

630
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:55,511
lt will destroy Periyar river too.

631
00:40:55,719 --> 00:41:00,418
They will destroy our culture
and bring capitalist rule here.

632
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:04,856
We should start a strong
agitation against that.

633
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:06,586
Capitalist.
- Get lost.

634
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,094
Township.
- Down. Down.

635
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:11,493
LCP. Hail.
- LCP. Hail.

636
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,272
The entire atmosphere has
been changed.

637
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,599
Father, you don't try to
escape from all this.

638
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:23,273
Fathers can not only interfere in social life
but also can interfere in the political scenario.

639
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:26,041
Bishops have given permission for that.
- Yes.

640
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:30,778
So, father, you should take the president's
position of TC and come with us.

641
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:33,684
TC?
- Yes. Township Committee.

642
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:35,950
lt has been formed very recently.
l am the treasurer.

643
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:39,460
l don't have any problem in
becoming the president.

644
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:43,228
lt is good that development is
coming in the village.- Yes.

645
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:49,799
But it is cruel that they are saying to
vacate the house for that house owners.

646
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,805
Father, if they don't vacate that house,
then my livelihood becomes difficult.

647
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,638
He will go only for the
township's work.

648
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:59,304
lf township comes, a lot of people
will come here to stay.

649
00:41:59,517 --> 00:41:59,983
That's right.

650
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:03,813
Not only that l will getjob in
five star hotels laundry.

651
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:07,320
Father, let this poor washer
man escape.

652
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:08,822
lf the price of land increases,

653
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:14,328
then l can sell a part of my land and
build a hotel instead of my shop.

654
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:19,333
Father, you know that l am not
able to go in boat now.

655
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:25,498
l heard that people like me will get
job in hotel and hospital as security.

656
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:28,401
Don't confuse father by saying all this.

657
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:34,514
Father, l am not speaking anything about
the changes that come in my Kodanad resort.

658
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:38,950
Father, you are saying for long time
that our church should be renovated.

659
00:42:39,156 --> 00:42:45,186
For making hotel, hospital and
shopping complex millionaires are coming.

660
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:49,127
lf you ask, they will give you the
money to build a ten-floor church.

661
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,131
Don't try to seduce me by speaking
about church's matter.

662
00:42:55,806 --> 00:42:58,798
l haven't become unconscious by
hearing you people's confession.

663
00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:05,380
Then too, this is everyone's wish.
l will come.

664
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:09,047
Father, that day you told me that
the person who comes..

665
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:10,477
..to buy this land would be devil, right?

666
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:12,553
Father, now you also
accompanied the devils.

667
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:18,384
Situations are making man
into devils and God.

668
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:21,595
These people are saying that
if you leave this house, then..

669
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:23,699
..Krovli and Sudhakaran will
also leave their house.

670
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:26,898
This is the matter which would
benefit the villagers.

671
00:43:27,137 --> 00:43:31,005
Father, did we ever go against the matter
which is beneficial for the villagers?

672
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:32,175
This is not the reason.

673
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:35,470
lf they want to build a hotel, they will get
some other land at the banks of the river.

674
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:37,908
This is the place from where
a lot of children are getting..

675
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:41,744
..pure milk and a lot of family is
getting organic fruits and vegetables.

676
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:48,157
Why they are so stubborn that
they will build hotel in this place only?

677
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:52,656
That..
- l have asked this to Chandi sir.

678
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:55,357
Chandi Sir's 5 acres land
is behind your land.

679
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:59,034
lt will get frontage only if he
gets your land.

680
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:09,436
Chandi Sir is saying that no other land
in our place is as good as your land.

681
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,609
lf it was my land, l would have
sold it that time itself.

682
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:16,445
Chandi had brought that land
two-three years back.

683
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,287
That time also this place
was the same.

684
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:19,615
That time he hadn't felt of
making all this.

685
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:22,451
Now, where did he get the idea of
making hotel and township from?

686
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:29,964
Something is amiss in this
which we won't know.

687
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,294
Mathai, why are you thinking
about all these things?

688
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,971
You want a land to start farming
instead of this, right?

689
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:37,140
We will find that.
- Yes.

690
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:40,306
We will find that in this ward itself.

691
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:43,975
We won't give a good farmer like
you to anyone else.- Yes.

692
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:47,417
Hey, if someone tells you to
throw your wife and they will..

693
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:48,983
..give you another lady instead of her,
then would you be happy?

694
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:50,584
My land is like that for me.

695
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:54,154
l am working on this land
since l was 15.

696
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,882
The land which hears when l call them.

697
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:59,324
This land is not only the house of mine
and these people...

698
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,498
..but also the house of cows
who will stop milking

699
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:04,667
if they're taken from here and also the house
of each & every plant which is growing here.

700
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:06,335
ls it possible to replant it
somewhere else?

701
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:09,172
You are social workers,
don't be a fool.

702
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:12,103
We have come here for the villagers
and not for our own benefit.

703
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:15,506
Be careful while abusing us.
- What a nuisance is this?

704
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,874
This is my land and house.
l am not selling this.

705
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:19,909
lt's good that you are deciding alone.

706
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:22,684
You should face the after
effect of this alone.

707
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:43,707
Hello.
- Hello.

708
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:44,870
This is Bedsy.

709
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:48,702
The programme about my mother is
being telecasted tomorrow at 6.30pm.

710
00:45:49,279 --> 00:45:50,906
About teacher?
Yes. l will see.

711
00:45:51,448 --> 00:45:52,005
One more thing.

712
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:54,844
Mathews, l am planning to conduct
one documentary about your farm.

713
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:55,712
When should l come there?

714
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:59,218
l am a little busy now.
Bedsy, l will call you afterwards.

715
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:02,723
Good morning.

716
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:05,990
Chandi has tightened his hand
around your neck, right?

717
00:46:07,164 --> 00:46:08,062
One minute.

718
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:09,725
Just a minute.
- Okay.

719
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:17,400
Sir, did you ask for my land on that
day for Chandi's hotel people?

720
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:20,736
What hotel?
These all are Chandi's tricks.

721
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:25,412
A person who came to watch
the cricket tournament in..

722
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:28,414
..Kochi had also come to see
the elephant's rest house.

723
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,177
He had seen your place too.

724
00:46:30,387 --> 00:46:35,415
He is buying that land not
for making hotel.

725
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:39,255
lt is for making a resort for
him to spend his vacation.

726
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:42,192
l came to know about this
through my people.

727
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:44,594
Then why Chandi is boasting
about hotel and township?

728
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:46,267
Chandi used to lie.

729
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:50,600
He knew that he can keep people on
his side by saying something like that.

730
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:56,178
Not only that, there is one traditional real
estate trick of increasing the price of land.

731
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:57,944
Trick?
- Yes!

732
00:46:58,215 --> 00:47:01,548
Two years back, Chandi had
brought six plots here when..

733
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:03,617
..the news spread that aircraft company
is going to come up here.

734
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:06,219
lt didn't happen and his money
got blocked there.

735
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:07,788
Then financial crisis also came.

736
00:47:09,426 --> 00:47:10,950
Now, if he gets your land too,

737
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:15,458
then he can make it into one plot and sell
to that Mumbai fellow at a higher rate.

738
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,861
By showing the document
of selling to him,

739
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:22,468
he can convince the people
about township.

740
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:25,801
ln the name of that, he can sell the
other five plots also at a higher rate.

741
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:30,469
Chandi has planned real estate
fraud of crores.

742
00:47:43,927 --> 00:47:44,586
Baby.
- Yes.

743
00:47:44,795 --> 00:47:45,659
ls what heard true?
- Yes.

744
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,490
That agricultural officer has told him.

745
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:51,232
ls member Papachan here?
- He is there inside.

746
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:52,163
Hello.

747
00:47:58,709 --> 00:47:59,676
Why are you here?

748
00:48:10,787 --> 00:48:12,186
What is this?
Sales agreement.

749
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:16,426
While thinking afterwards l felt
that why should l stand..

750
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:19,352
..against a matter which is
beneficial for the village?

751
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:21,689
No hotel and township is
going to come here.

752
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:22,758
Who told you?

753
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:26,862
Agricultural officer Thomas Sir.
- Tell as real estate agent Thomas.

754
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,867
He had come to you for
property dealing.

755
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:31,632
He is afraid of not getting that.
- No.

756
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:35,439
They are building a private resort
for a Mumbai fellow,

757
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:36,544
he is....trying to vacate them.

758
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:39,375
Would any Mumbai fellow
buy land in the shore of..

759
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:43,710
..Periyar river for eating flatbread
and potato curry once in a way.

760
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:46,890
His people only informed Thomas Sir.
Otherwise he let him tell.

761
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:50,321
Chandi, it is true that the
people in Kodanadu have..

762
00:48:50,494 --> 00:48:52,758
..seen a lot of dreams
about the township.

763
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:56,727
But with that in mind
don't try to cheat us.

764
00:48:57,167 --> 00:48:59,727
l have expected all this rumours.

765
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:03,566
Father, l will describe everything
because you have interfered in this.

766
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:04,672
Everybody come with me.

767
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:18,683
Look, this is the sketches of
hotel, hospital, college and..

768
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:20,754
..shopping complex which
is going to come here.

769
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:23,518
This is the agreement which
l made with a number of..

770
00:49:23,727 --> 00:49:27,993
..millionaires including that
Mumbai fellow and some..

771
00:49:28,198 --> 00:49:30,428
..reputed companies which
agreed to make all these.

772
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:33,865
Anyone can check this.
Take. Take Mathew. See.

773
00:49:34,071 --> 00:49:37,006
A real estate agent like you
can make fake documents.

774
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:38,606
What is this, Mathews?

775
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:41,437
Mathai, would anyone make all these
by spending money if it is of no use?

776
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:44,113
Township will come here.
We are sure.

777
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:45,179
Bhageevan. Lakshmanan.

778
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:52,687
By seeing the novena we
believe Jesus, right?

779
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:56,948
Like that, after seeing this
agreement and sketch..

780
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:06,035
You are making these poor people fools
by showing this agreement and sketch.

781
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:08,300
But you are going to do
a big property scam.

782
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:09,301
l am sure about that.

783
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:11,737
Chandi, you won't even take the
sand which sticks on your..

784
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:13,967
..feet while walking through my land.

785
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,407
You don't laugh.
lt is not possible.

786
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:42,568
Krovli, l hadn't thought that you
will cheat us after living like one family.

787
00:50:42,806 --> 00:50:46,003
Why do you have this much
love for the villagers?

788
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:48,674
For the benefit of villagers that
was only one excuse.

789
00:50:49,279 --> 00:50:53,511
Chandi has agreed to give as
a flat in Eranakulam for the..

790
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:56,345
..remaining price of house and land.

791
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,520
He hadn't told that to me.
He told that to Josekutty's wife's family.

792
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:03,591
They have called to Dubai
and informed Josekutty.

793
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:07,790
Now, he needs his wife
and her people.

794
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,032
How will l say all these to everyone?

795
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:13,532
lf he says, then l can't say
anything against that.

796
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:17,866
He has to conduct her marriage.

797
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:22,808
Are you not ashamed to say that you
don't have any right in your son's matter?

798
00:51:23,146 --> 00:51:27,810
Mother, he doesn't feel any loss of that.
He is going to get a flat in the city.

799
00:51:28,652 --> 00:51:33,214
lt is a luck for the people who live happily
without considering the neighbours.

800
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:37,484
l know that you are angry with me for not
giving side with you when you are in a trouble.

801
00:51:37,694 --> 00:51:39,218
l am sad not because of not
standing on my side.

802
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:41,226
But because of the reason that
you are giving side for cheating.

803
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:44,829
The informer of agricultural officer is admitted
to the hospital after Chandi had stabbed him.

804
00:51:45,035 --> 00:51:46,400
What agricultural officer had
said is true.

805
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:49,298
Sketch and agreement are fake
document which Chandi has made.

806
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:52,006
Would anyone believe
all these if you say?

807
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:54,905
l don't care.
But l won't leave this house.

808
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:57,906
l don't have a son like you.

809
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:04,746
Take.

810
00:52:21,404 --> 00:52:23,201
l can't go without seeing you.

811
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:28,441
That's why l have come here
after doing all these.

812
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:35,550
l am not sure that whether
we will see again.

813
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:39,782
You don't hate me.

814
00:52:54,905 --> 00:52:57,965
The people in this village are
wishing for this township.

815
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:04,978
Then too, the party has gone
against it only for Sudhakaran.

816
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:09,652
We can't go against the wish
of the people now.

817
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:12,981
We should welcome the township.

818
00:53:13,456 --> 00:53:16,823
Master, what is this?
Our party is having some principles.

819
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:19,894
We have never done anything
as per people's wish.

820
00:53:20,096 --> 00:53:23,588
We are suffering the result of that
after the last Parliament election.

821
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:26,730
We have to remove the
bad image of the party.

822
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:28,928
lf township comes,
a lot of people will come here.

823
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:31,334
We will get lot of donation
in our bucket.

824
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,441
We can renovate this party office.

825
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:37,840
Then we can start trade unions
in college, hotel and hospital.

826
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,615
lf necessary, we can close
them by conduction strikes.

827
00:53:41,151 --> 00:53:45,247
Party is seeing this as a big
opportunity for party's growth.

828
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:47,188
What secretary said is true.

829
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:48,186
lf township comes here

830
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:50,859
then l don't have to go to the..
..market for selling coconut.

831
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:53,589
Hotel and hospital will take that.

832
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:55,865
lt is necessary that our party
should strengthen.

833
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:58,458
l have worked for the party.

834
00:53:58,835 --> 00:54:01,167
ls it necessary that the party should
strengthen by sacrificing my house?

835
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:04,864
Sudhakaran, you don't know that
as per Leninism, there is..

836
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:11,446
..no personal interest and
only party's interest is important.

837
00:54:16,653 --> 00:54:19,884
lt is area committee's decision that
we have to support the township.

838
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:24,049
Aluva Chandi has spoken about that
to the area secretary personally.

839
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:25,125
Now, l understood.

840
00:54:25,328 --> 00:54:29,230
You have not taken this decision for
the party but as a part of scam.

841
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:32,560
Don't say anything about scam.
That party won't tolerate.

842
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:36,235
Sudhakaran, if you want,
you can accept the party's decision.

843
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:38,233
Otherwise leave the party.

844
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:45,748
This is not that old Kerala.

845
00:54:46,182 --> 00:54:50,175
Here, underworld dons like Aluva Chandi
are deciding everything.

846
00:54:51,655 --> 00:54:54,089
They have good hold in police
and political party.

847
00:54:54,724 --> 00:54:59,923
That's why even Sudhakaran has sold
that house and left the place.

848
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:06,762
ls it needed that we should go
for a fight with Chandi?

849
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:08,999
lf you lose this land,
let's buy another land.

850
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:10,939
But if something happens to you..

851
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:13,203
That's why l came here now.

852
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:16,771
Uncle, you are feeling this as a big
problem because of your sincerity.

853
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,948
Sincerity towards your insurance job.

854
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:22,710
Uncle, you are not getting
any policy from this place..

855
00:55:22,919 --> 00:55:25,615
..because of our problem
with the villagers, right?

856
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:28,689
Not that. lf they need policy,
they will take.

857
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,127
l told this to you for our safety.
- Okay.

858
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,891
l am going.

859
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,230
lf you need any help, then call me.

860
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,901
Father, have you got scared
by hearing about underworld?

861
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:51,974
l haven't got scared, son.
He is my only relative.

862
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:57,145
l was thinking that if some trouble comes
then even he won't be there with us.

863
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:58,153
Yes. What happened?

864
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:02,155
l am fed up of hearing
about her neighbours.

865
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:03,656
Now, you console her.

866
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:07,721
Mother, loving your neighbour like you,
is not possible nowadays.

867
00:56:07,964 --> 00:56:09,659
Nowadays, it is better not
to have neighbours.

868
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:10,833
Son, it's not that.

869
00:56:11,067 --> 00:56:15,663
When Sudhakaran was with us, l had the
strength that his party was also along with us.

870
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:19,000
Son, should we also leave this house?

871
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:22,667
Yes, for going to church and market,
we have to leave this house.- Yes.

872
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:26,838
Market and church won't come here.
Mother, this is our land.

873
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,014
No one will vacate us from here.

874
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:30,519
Mathews.

875
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:38,618
Don't stick that advertisement there.
Cow will eat that.

876
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:40,887
Hey, advertiser.
- Who are you?

877
00:56:41,097 --> 00:56:42,394
l am the health inspector of
this Panchayat (village council).

878
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:44,726
Sorry. l felt so by seeing your health.

879
00:56:44,934 --> 00:56:45,559
Sir, what is this?

880
00:56:45,769 --> 00:56:47,794
Stop memo. You have to close
this farm within one week.

881
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:54,069
Close? What happened?

882
00:56:54,377 --> 00:56:56,072
Water pollution, sound pollution and smell.

883
00:56:56,279 --> 00:56:58,577
Showing this three reasons your
neighbour Chandi has given one petition.

884
00:56:58,782 --> 00:57:01,580
Sir, you know about the fight
between Aluva Chandi and us.

885
00:57:01,785 --> 00:57:05,084
He is doing this for revenge.
Believing that you..

886
00:57:05,288 --> 00:57:06,585
l don't want to know about your fights.

887
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:08,917
lf l get a petition,
then l have to take action.

888
00:57:15,632 --> 00:57:17,600
Sir. Sir, don't say anything like that.

889
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:19,928
You got a complaint, okay.
But you have to inspect that, right?

890
00:57:20,136 --> 00:57:21,603
Sir, you look.
ls there any problem here?

891
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:24,103
l will come to inspect after one week.
That time the farm won't be here.

892
00:57:25,642 --> 00:57:30,443
Sir. Sir, don't speak like that.
Closing this farm is equivalent to killing us.

893
00:57:30,647 --> 00:57:31,944
No one had any nuisance
because of this farm.

894
00:57:32,148 --> 00:57:33,547
People only got benefit out of it.
Sir, try to understand that.

895
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,775
Hey, there is no use of
my understanding.

896
00:57:35,985 --> 00:57:37,282
The entire villagers are against you.

897
00:57:38,588 --> 00:57:39,111
Sir.

898
00:57:40,323 --> 00:57:40,789
One more thing.

899
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:44,016
You can't carry on with this by fighting
with people like Aluva Chandi.

900
00:57:48,097 --> 00:57:48,620
Oh.

901
00:57:50,733 --> 00:57:53,293
Oh, Jesus.
What sort of testing time is this?

902
00:57:53,837 --> 00:57:56,305
Chandi is thinking that we will leave
this place if the farm is closed.

903
00:57:56,506 --> 00:57:58,633
Why are the court and law here?
Wants to close farm.

904
00:57:58,842 --> 00:57:59,809
lt's not possible for anyone.

905
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:01,636
Mother, don't worry.
We will take a stay order from the court.

906
00:58:02,345 --> 00:58:06,543
Yes. Yes. Bobby's friend is
a good advocate. Advocate lssac.

907
00:58:06,749 --> 00:58:08,148
l will call him now.

908
00:58:16,226 --> 00:58:17,955
Mathews.
- Yes. Yes.

909
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:27,795
lssac. Where is lssac?
- Are you standing here?

910
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:30,905
l...l have called you several times,
but l haven't got.

911
00:58:31,274 --> 00:58:33,299
Court has ordered to appoint
commission.- Okay.

912
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,478
Then where is the commission?

913
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:36,645
ln the municipal court.
- Okay.

914
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:38,313
Sir.
- You walk.

915
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:40,475
Okay.
- Her name is Sunita.

916
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:42,913
A fair and slim girl.
l have spoken to her.

917
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:45,917
ls there anything to be scared
about the commission?

918
00:58:46,122 --> 00:58:48,386
This commission is not a lion or tiger.

919
00:58:48,591 --> 00:58:50,991
We should take them in a vehicle.
Buy good food for them.

920
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:52,923
And give some money.
That's all.

921
00:58:54,097 --> 00:58:55,155
After all, she is a girl.

922
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:57,333
ls it necessary for an advocate
to tell you how to impress her?

923
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:58,831
You go.
- Sir. Sir.

924
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:03,836
Commission is a girl. So, it is better
that you also come with me.

925
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:07,339
l am not used to this.
- You do that yourself.

926
00:59:07,911 --> 00:59:10,675
Otherwise you will get an order to
close your farm from the court.

927
00:59:19,155 --> 00:59:24,354
Bedsy. Yes, Bedsy.
Yes. Yes. l was little busy.

928
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:28,520
That's why l didn't call you.
About shooting, that..

929
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:31,700
l will call you later.
l will call you.

930
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:34,697
Hello.
- Yes.

931
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:35,871
l am Mathews.
- Who?

932
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:37,539
Jermias farm's owner.
- Okay.

933
00:59:38,508 --> 00:59:39,873
Everything is ready, let's go.

934
00:59:40,343 --> 00:59:41,537
Hey, what are you saying?

935
00:59:42,145 --> 00:59:47,708
Commission. Commission means
Sunita Madam. You are Sunita, right?

936
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:49,980
Sunita has gone to the bar.
- Bar?

937
00:59:50,186 --> 00:59:51,118
Bar association.

938
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:53,389
Bar association. Yes. Yes.

939
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:01,886
Who is this Advocate Sunita?
- Sunita.

940
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:11,232
l...commission...Jermi...Jermias.
- What?

941
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:17,406
l am Mathews. Owner of Jermias farm.
Did Advocate lssac tell you? Mathews...l..

942
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:18,581
Yes. Yes.
- Good morning.

943
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:22,417
Let's go.

944
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:30,020
lf it is time for your lunch,
then on the way there is one..

945
01:00:30,226 --> 01:00:34,185
..Salim hotel. Mutton pilaf.
Are you vegetarian?

946
01:00:34,397 --> 01:00:37,195
What do you think about me?
l am coming with you for lunch.

947
01:00:39,235 --> 01:00:40,031
That..

948
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:43,101
This is for the first time
l am with a commission.

949
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,040
lf you want anything, you tell me.
- What do you want?

950
01:00:46,242 --> 01:00:47,368
For commission..

951
01:00:47,577 --> 01:00:48,271
For commission.

952
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:51,447
Do you have any wrong work
to be done by me?

953
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:54,446
Are all these for that?
- No. l am not like that.

954
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:57,119
Do you want me to write wrong report?
lt's not possible.

955
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:00,388
l will tell that now itself.
- l haven't meant that.

956
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:02,617
Come. Let's go in my vehicle.

957
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:04,952
Court is giving money for commission
to travel on her own.

958
01:01:05,895 --> 01:01:07,954
l...l will go in the front.

959
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:11,299
Come behind this vehicle. Okay.
Come behind this, okay.

960
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:17,033
Jesus. Take care of me.

961
01:01:39,262 --> 01:01:40,388
Come. Come. Come.

962
01:01:43,232 --> 01:01:46,326
l am not having the bad impression that
all advocates are behind money.

963
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:47,833
l am having a lot of enemies.

964
01:01:48,137 --> 01:01:50,833
You future is in my hand.
Sorry. My future is in your hand.

965
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,507
That's why l behave like
that in the court.

966
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:54,006
Don't feel anything bad.
Where is father?

967
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:55,837
He is in the cowshed.
- Come. Come.

968
01:01:57,613 --> 01:01:58,170
Come.

969
01:02:02,985 --> 01:02:03,952
That is cowshed, right?
- Yes.

970
01:02:04,153 --> 01:02:04,778
Look there.

971
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:07,854
The shed is away from
the neighbouring house.

972
01:02:08,491 --> 01:02:11,119
Even if the cow cries through
loud speaker, it won't go out.

973
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:17,533
This is the case which was
deliberately made for ill treating us.

974
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:19,361
That all commission will
understand by seeing this.

975
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:22,800
Look. How much clean
this cowshed is?

976
01:02:23,506 --> 01:02:24,768
Father, this is commission.
- Okay.

977
01:02:25,508 --> 01:02:27,271
We will remove the dung frequently.

978
01:02:27,477 --> 01:02:29,707
There is one special gutter in there.

979
01:02:29,979 --> 01:02:32,539
l will wash the shed everyday.
Cows too.

980
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,380
We will get good milk from neat cows.

981
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:41,717
We will spray some solution for
avoiding the flies.- Yes.

982
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:44,984
We will also burn some special
dry leaves too for that.

983
01:02:45,194 --> 01:02:46,058
l had forgotten to say that.

984
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:48,287
Let's see the dung cavity.

985
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,497
This is dung cavity.

986
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:53,895
lt's too away from the cow shed.
Mosquito won't come even near to this.

987
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:57,129
No dung is there.
lt's not sufficient for agriculture.

988
01:02:57,707 --> 01:03:00,232
Then too, we used to spray
some Ayurveda solution..

989
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:02,673
..for mosquitoes not to eggs in this.
Come.

990
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:08,242
What water pollution is here?

991
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:11,917
Even l won't take bath here for
not getting the water polluted.

992
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:18,757
See. ls there any smell except
the smell of grass and milk?

993
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:19,928
Give.

994
01:03:20,229 --> 01:03:23,357
How come l know that you have
cleaned all this because l am coming.

995
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:26,264
Drink buttermilk.
- No.

996
01:03:28,271 --> 01:03:31,434
We are treating cows
as our own children.

997
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:35,266
Would anyone keep the place dirty
where their children sleep?

998
01:03:35,912 --> 01:03:36,936
Please take daughter.

999
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:49,755
Are you going without liking this?

1000
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:53,557
l haven't come to buy this.

1001
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:58,194
l haven't seen any problem here.
That l will report.

1002
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:03,230
Should l leave...No, right?

1003
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:15,242
Mother. Mother. We have escaped.
Our farm won't close.

1004
01:04:15,451 --> 01:04:16,145
Father.

1005
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:36,596
Who is Jermias?
- l.

1006
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:41,339
l am Deputy Tahsildar (officer).
They are from SFC and village office.

1007
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:42,841
One notice is for you.

1008
01:04:48,484 --> 01:04:51,248
What is this?
- This is as per section seven.

1009
01:04:51,621 --> 01:04:55,022
You have money and you haven't
paid the debt to government.

1010
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:58,193
You have taken a loan from SFC
in 87, right? This is for that.

1011
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:00,362
For that this house had
been attached.

1012
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:05,193
We got only Rs.2.5 lakh from auction.
The debt was Rs.3 lakh, right?

1013
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:08,469
ln which account we will include
the remaining Rs.50,000.

1014
01:05:08,671 --> 01:05:13,699
Now, you have to pay Rs.27,75,000
including interest and interest's interest.

1015
01:05:15,177 --> 01:05:17,702
That file had been closed
after l met Kurivilla Sir, finance..

1016
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:21,042
..minister of that time and
he interfered and the remaining..

1017
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:25,209
..amount Rs.50,000 was wrote off.

1018
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:27,715
The manager of that time
Potty Sir has told me that.

1019
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:31,223
What is the use of saying
about all this?

1020
01:05:31,494 --> 01:05:32,961
Do you have non-liability certificate?

1021
01:05:35,064 --> 01:05:38,227
That time l was in a bad physical
condition because of debt.

1022
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:39,731
l trusted Potty sir.

1023
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:41,563
That's why l haven't gone
behind the certificate.

1024
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:43,405
Now in whose name is this property?

1025
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:44,470
ln my name.

1026
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:48,241
l have brought it from Unus who
has won the auction of SFC.

1027
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,507
Sir, we have enquired all that.

1028
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:53,745
We can't attach land because
it is not in his name.

1029
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,577
So we have to recover as cash.

1030
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:58,083
Sir, if there is any problem in
this matter 20 year ago, then..

1031
01:05:58,287 --> 01:05:59,584
..you have to inform us earlier itself.

1032
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:02,087
And if you come now and
tell us to repay. What is this?

1033
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:03,258
l don't want to know all this.

1034
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:07,190
You sign that paper and go and meet
the manager in SFC and settle the loan.

1035
01:06:07,563 --> 01:06:08,689
Otherwise it is a problem.

1036
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:20,932
Hello. l was in meeting.
l will call.

1037
01:06:26,582 --> 01:06:27,606
You are Jermias, right?

1038
01:06:29,051 --> 01:06:33,852
You have to pay Rs.27,75,000.
When will you pay?

1039
01:06:34,423 --> 01:06:37,620
Please listen to what we are saying.
- Please come.

1040
01:06:38,728 --> 01:06:41,959
l know the story, which you made
the finance minister to recommend.

1041
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:45,293
For listening that again, we,
government officers are not..

1042
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:47,135
..sitting without any work.

1043
01:06:47,436 --> 01:06:48,300
l..

1044
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:54,306
lf l said something badly to you
while l came to see you..

1045
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:57,407
..this is not the situation
to show revenge against that.

1046
01:06:57,613 --> 01:06:58,307
Who is he?

1047
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:00,577
l...l..
- My son.

1048
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:02,575
l don't want to create
any nuisance for others.

1049
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:07,212
lt's my duty to recover the
money of government.

1050
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:11,421
lf you won't pay, then arrest warrant
will be made as per section 65.

1051
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:13,491
l haven't done any default.

1052
01:07:13,763 --> 01:07:15,390
That you understand by
seeing the file.

1053
01:07:16,132 --> 01:07:19,158
Tell Yesudas to show these
people's file.- Okay, sir.

1054
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:21,666
You tell there when you will repay.

1055
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:33,177
See this.

1056
01:07:33,482 --> 01:07:37,009
The balance amount Rs.50,000 will be
recovered through legal proceedings.

1057
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:40,188
Potty Sir had written the note like this.
See the signature.

1058
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:43,419
Potty sir has directly told me
that the file is closed.

1059
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:45,618
Son, some cheating has
happened in this.

1060
01:07:45,828 --> 01:07:46,954
What? We cheated?

1061
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:49,026
Listen what he is saying
for not paying the debt.

1062
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:50,357
We have cheated him.

1063
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:52,697
You also have seen
what is written in the file.

1064
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:54,369
Make him understand that.

1065
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:56,701
What is the use of writing
in this file?

1066
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:59,966
Why didn't you inform us
about this problem?

1067
01:08:00,176 --> 01:08:01,700
We have sent notice from here.

1068
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:03,640
We haven't got any notice like that.

1069
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:07,048
When will you repay the debt?

1070
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:09,649
No need to waste your sound
like this for us.

1071
01:08:09,852 --> 01:08:11,046
lf you speak slowly
then too we can hear.

1072
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:14,381
Oh! You are ashamed that
someone will hear, right?

1073
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:16,217
Both are looking gentleman.

1074
01:08:16,492 --> 01:08:21,896
But won't pay the money which
he owes to government.

1075
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:24,396
What?
- They said we are lying.

1076
01:08:25,868 --> 01:08:28,336
This is not a robbery group to take
money from you by saying lies.

1077
01:08:28,537 --> 01:08:29,401
This is SFC.

1078
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:31,573
You don't have any problem
with money.

1079
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:34,576
You are the father of a big
farmhouse owner who is..

1080
01:08:35,244 --> 01:08:38,975
..helping the government
for giving us salary.

1081
01:08:39,181 --> 01:08:41,672
Now his job is to obstruct the
township which is beneficial..

1082
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:46,147
..for the villagers with his cows.
- Don't say anything about cows.

1083
01:08:46,689 --> 01:08:51,353
He will become angry.
He has invented the cows.- Oh!

1084
01:08:51,927 --> 01:08:55,363
We are living without making
any nuisance for others.

1085
01:08:55,564 --> 01:08:57,259
Please don't make us
ashamed like this.

1086
01:08:57,466 --> 01:09:00,993
We are showing our manners
after repaying the debts.

1087
01:09:01,237 --> 01:09:03,569
And not showing any fraud
to avoid repaying.

1088
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:05,770
Whom you...Father.

1089
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:07,776
What happened, Father?

1090
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:10,369
Feeling weak.
- Come.

1091
01:09:16,352 --> 01:09:19,913
Mathews, Chandi surely
interfered in this case.

1092
01:09:20,723 --> 01:09:23,521
Chandi had threatened me
for appearing for you.

1093
01:09:24,126 --> 01:09:27,857
l can't fight with them.
Please leave me.

1094
01:09:30,199 --> 01:09:31,757
Nair. Come.

1095
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:47,774
ls this Advocate Sunita's house?
- Yes.

1096
01:09:48,484 --> 01:09:49,109
Who are you?

1097
01:09:49,451 --> 01:09:51,009
l have come here to
discuss one case

1098
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:53,352
She is gone out.
- Okay.

1099
01:09:54,657 --> 01:09:55,715
She will come now.
- Okay.

1100
01:09:55,991 --> 01:09:57,288
Please come.
- Okay.

1101
01:10:04,733 --> 01:10:05,961
Please take your seat.
- Okay.

1102
01:10:08,337 --> 01:10:09,463
Are you coming from
somewhere nearby?

1103
01:10:09,672 --> 01:10:10,798
No. l am from a distant place.

1104
01:10:11,006 --> 01:10:12,303
lt is very important matter.

1105
01:10:12,608 --> 01:10:13,973
l know the advocate earlier itself.

1106
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:16,310
She had come in my farm
as commission.

1107
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:22,044
What happened?

1108
01:10:22,351 --> 01:10:24,717
Are you come here with such a case?

1109
01:10:25,087 --> 01:10:27,385
What happened?
- Don't feel bad.

1110
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:29,658
Aluva Chandi had recommended
through her..

1111
01:10:29,858 --> 01:10:32,656
..senior advocate to give
a wrong certificate against you.

1112
01:10:33,028 --> 01:10:33,995
She hadn't listened that.

1113
01:10:34,196 --> 01:10:36,323
The senior advocate has
dismissed her from the office.

1114
01:10:39,635 --> 01:10:43,765
Till she submitted the report, a lot
of threatening calls had come here.

1115
01:10:44,373 --> 01:10:46,068
Here, children and l are alone.

1116
01:10:46,542 --> 01:10:48,407
Only strength is that Sunita
is an advocate.

1117
01:10:48,644 --> 01:10:51,738
Then too, could we sleep
in the court at night?

1118
01:10:52,615 --> 01:10:54,515
Ah! l didn't know anything.

1119
01:10:56,619 --> 01:10:59,452
lf there is any problem like this,
then please inform me.

1120
01:11:00,055 --> 01:11:01,454
This is my number.

1121
01:11:04,827 --> 01:11:05,759
May l go?

1122
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:08,855
What happened?

1123
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:12,696
Nothing.

1124
01:11:13,235 --> 01:11:15,533
ls it an exhibition ground
to come unnecessarily?

1125
01:11:15,804 --> 01:11:18,034
He has come here to discuss
some case.

1126
01:11:18,674 --> 01:11:19,470
What case?

1127
01:11:20,976 --> 01:11:24,878
When l saw your smartness that day,
l thought that you..

1128
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:27,705
..might have a soldier father and
three-four brothers who are..

1129
01:11:27,916 --> 01:11:29,781
..having good hold in police
and politics.

1130
01:11:30,486 --> 01:11:31,384
This..

1131
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:33,615
This is a case against Aluva Chandi.

1132
01:11:35,758 --> 01:11:39,159
l was waiting for getting
a case against him.

1133
01:11:40,529 --> 01:11:41,223
Dear.

1134
01:11:42,264 --> 01:11:44,061
How much he had made us suffer?

1135
01:11:44,933 --> 01:11:48,232
How can l practice as advocate if l
get scared of someone's threatening?

1136
01:11:48,604 --> 01:11:49,798
How will we life?

1137
01:11:51,173 --> 01:11:54,074
For conducting a case against
Aluva Chandi, there is no need of hold,

1138
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:56,141
only the support of law is needed.

1139
01:11:56,345 --> 01:12:01,078
l am sure that it is a truthful case.

1140
01:12:02,685 --> 01:12:05,483
Please take your seat.
Mother, take tea.

1141
01:12:11,627 --> 01:12:12,594
He has not come yet.

1142
01:12:13,295 --> 01:12:16,264
Sreedevi Madam was the legal
advisor of SFC for three-four years.

1143
01:12:16,632 --> 01:12:18,759
Sreedevi Madam has asked him
to come. He will come.

1144
01:12:18,967 --> 01:12:19,934
Take. Tea.

1145
01:12:20,703 --> 01:12:22,102
Sir, please sit inside.

1146
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:23,938
Now, this is her office.

1147
01:12:24,139 --> 01:12:25,606
We are waiting for someone.
- Okay.

1148
01:12:25,874 --> 01:12:26,533
He is coming.

1149
01:12:27,543 --> 01:12:28,601
Good morning.
- Please sit.

1150
01:12:28,811 --> 01:12:30,278
One tea.
- Okay.

1151
01:12:30,579 --> 01:12:31,773
l am advocate Sunita.

1152
01:12:32,648 --> 01:12:34,946
Some cheating has happened
in his case, right?

1153
01:12:35,384 --> 01:12:39,286
One week back, Aluva Chandi had come
and met Assistant Manager Yesudasan sir.

1154
01:12:39,488 --> 01:12:41,046
He has taken all your files.

1155
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:44,286
l too struggled in the store
room for that.

1156
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:47,788
My doubt is that they might have
replaced the papers in that file.

1157
01:12:48,163 --> 01:12:50,791
How is it possible?
The paper in that file is old.

1158
01:12:50,999 --> 01:12:53,467
The signature of Potty sir
is also there.

1159
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:55,803
Mathews, aren't you living
in this era?

1160
01:12:56,171 --> 01:13:01,700
The document makers possess
the old stamp papers and other papers.

1161
01:13:01,977 --> 01:13:03,137
Now no need of all that.

1162
01:13:03,445 --> 01:13:07,211
For making the paper old, cover the paper
with the fumes of brimstone.- Yes.

1163
01:13:07,883 --> 01:13:11,319
To make the writing old
add plantain stain.- Yes.

1164
01:13:11,754 --> 01:13:13,312
Also there is no difficulty to
put anyone's signature.

1165
01:13:14,523 --> 01:13:17,924
Chandi is having a document writer
who is an expert in all this.

1166
01:13:18,127 --> 01:13:18,991
Bhuvnachandran.

1167
01:13:19,461 --> 01:13:24,091
Even when God can't find the
document he makes its duplicate.

1168
01:13:26,201 --> 01:13:28,669
Does that manager know all these?

1169
01:13:28,871 --> 01:13:30,839
They have misguided her
by saying something.

1170
01:13:31,306 --> 01:13:33,103
She is very stubborn.

1171
01:13:33,542 --> 01:13:37,103
MD Bashir Sir has strictly
ordered her to recover the money.

1172
01:13:37,379 --> 01:13:39,279
Do you know, Bashir sir is the
relative of finance minister?

1173
01:13:40,382 --> 01:13:42,680
Sir, you have to repay the loan.
No other option is available.

1174
01:13:43,385 --> 01:13:44,511
May l go?

1175
01:13:52,227 --> 01:13:53,023
Thank you sir.

1176
01:13:59,001 --> 01:14:04,200
l have to sell my land for paying
Rs.28 lakhs immediately.

1177
01:14:05,007 --> 01:14:06,474
Otherwise my father will go to jail.

1178
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:10,879
Advocate, ls there any option
to escape from this trap?

1179
01:14:11,079 --> 01:14:15,778
lt's difficult to prove that the
paper in the file is fake.

1180
01:14:17,085 --> 01:14:20,543
Only one option is there.

1181
01:14:22,491 --> 01:14:23,822
lt's difficult path.

1182
01:14:24,493 --> 01:14:29,123
Mathews, you go and make a
non-liability certificate with

1183
01:14:29,865 --> 01:14:33,198
Bhuvnachandran which shows
that you had cleared.

1184
01:14:33,435 --> 01:14:37,838
the debt in SFC 20 years back.

1185
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:42,433
But in that old manager's
signature is needed.

1186
01:14:44,546 --> 01:14:45,911
l will take the photocopy
of that file with the

1187
01:14:46,181 --> 01:14:49,673
help of the person who came here now.

1188
01:14:50,619 --> 01:14:52,678
Then l will make non-liability certificate.
- Okay.

1189
01:14:52,888 --> 01:14:56,016
lf they prove that non-liability
certificate is fake,

1190
01:14:56,225 --> 01:14:59,592
then l will prove that the papers
in the file are fake too.

1191
01:15:01,296 --> 01:15:01,955
Okay.

1192
01:15:03,265 --> 01:15:04,698
Boss, l got it.

1193
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:06,733
l will get it ready.

1194
01:15:06,935 --> 01:15:08,129
Okay. Okay.

1195
01:15:08,537 --> 01:15:09,936
What we were talking?

1196
01:15:10,138 --> 01:15:12,606
The villagers are not allowing
to fill the pond, right?- Yes.

1197
01:15:12,808 --> 01:15:14,207
ls there any chance of getting
one small crocodile?

1198
01:15:14,409 --> 01:15:14,875
What?

1199
01:15:15,077 --> 01:15:16,567
ls there any chance of getting
one small crocodile?

1200
01:15:16,778 --> 01:15:17,642
What for?

1201
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:21,642
You put one small crocodile
in the water.

1202
01:15:21,917 --> 01:15:24,511
The pond with crocodile will be a
threaten for the life of villagers.

1203
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:25,186
Okay.

1204
01:15:25,387 --> 01:15:27,787
Collector will order to fill that.

1205
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:31,819
Government in its own expense
will fill your 2 acres of land.

1206
01:15:33,095 --> 01:15:36,394
lf you are not getting small crocodile,
then l will give you one.

1207
01:15:36,598 --> 01:15:38,896
l am having the distribution
agency of that too.

1208
01:15:39,768 --> 01:15:40,735
Then that is enough.

1209
01:15:40,936 --> 01:15:42,904
Give me a small advance of Rs.10,000.

1210
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:46,732
When will it be possible?

1211
01:15:46,942 --> 01:15:49,206
My crocodile has gone for a work like this.

1212
01:15:49,411 --> 01:15:51,743
After it comes back, l will call you.
- Okay.

1213
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:53,010
Okay.

1214
01:16:02,658 --> 01:16:03,920
Ashokan SP.

1215
01:16:04,826 --> 01:16:05,451
Who?

1216
01:16:06,194 --> 01:16:08,025
Rural SP Ashokan lPS.

1217
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:10,429
Sir.

1218
01:16:10,632 --> 01:16:12,099
Yes, sir, l will give him.

1219
01:16:12,901 --> 01:16:14,528
He wants to speak to you.

1220
01:16:16,872 --> 01:16:18,430
Ashokan lPS.

1221
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:20,940
Hello.
- Hello.

1222
01:16:21,643 --> 01:16:23,440
He is my close person.

1223
01:16:23,645 --> 01:16:24,407
You do whatever he needs.

1224
01:16:24,613 --> 01:16:25,375
Yes, sir.

1225
01:16:26,148 --> 01:16:27,046
Okay, sir.

1226
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:32,717
When l heard that this SP has
suppressed the sand mafia.

1227
01:16:32,921 --> 01:16:35,014
l was planning to meet him.

1228
01:16:35,223 --> 01:16:36,588
Are you a relative of SP?

1229
01:16:36,792 --> 01:16:38,726
No. l am a family friend.

1230
01:16:38,927 --> 01:16:39,894
What do you want?

1231
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:43,159
l want a non-liability certificate of SFC.

1232
01:16:43,565 --> 01:16:44,122
That's all.

1233
01:16:44,333 --> 01:16:46,961
What's the need of recommending
the SP for that?

1234
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:48,395
l want today itself.

1235
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:51,801
Money is not a problem for me.
- But a problem for me.

1236
01:16:52,207 --> 01:16:53,902
How many years old you want?

1237
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:56,407
20 years.

1238
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:57,738
5000, 6000, 7000.

1239
01:16:57,946 --> 01:16:59,345
No, give me Rs.8000.
- Okay sir.

1240
01:16:59,548 --> 01:17:02,483
Sir, will you give me today itself?
- Yes, now itself.

1241
01:17:04,886 --> 01:17:06,285
Sit. l will come now.

1242
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:26,335
Hey, only 12 years old is needed.

1243
01:17:26,541 --> 01:17:28,600
You catch the stamp paper reversely.
Otherwise it will get burnt.

1244
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:30,607
We should give him training
in fast food stall.

1245
01:17:30,812 --> 01:17:31,836
Come. Come.

1246
01:17:39,855 --> 01:17:40,617
Sit.

1247
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:56,402
Got.

1248
01:17:56,605 --> 01:17:57,537
Damu.

1249
01:17:58,006 --> 01:17:59,871
SFC's letter head.

1250
01:18:00,075 --> 01:18:02,100
This is ten years old.

1251
01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:05,177
You make it ten more years old.
- Okay.

1252
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:06,711
Soon.
- Okay.

1253
01:18:10,819 --> 01:18:16,917
20 years means 1989.

1254
01:18:17,426 --> 01:18:19,223
Pen of that time.

1255
01:18:23,498 --> 01:18:24,430
Hero pen.

1256
01:18:24,633 --> 01:18:25,361
Jnanasheelan.
- Yes.

1257
01:18:25,567 --> 01:18:26,795
Plantain stain.
- Okay.

1258
01:18:30,305 --> 01:18:32,068
This is Chelpark.

1259
01:18:33,075 --> 01:18:34,542
Famous ink of that time.

1260
01:18:52,761 --> 01:18:53,921
Five years.

1261
01:18:55,897 --> 01:18:56,625
Ten years.

1262
01:18:58,366 --> 01:19:00,994
15 years
No. 1 7.

1263
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:06,635
20 years.

1264
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:08,668
Give me the matter.

1265
01:19:19,955 --> 01:19:22,321
This is Potty Sir's signature, right?
- Yes.

1266
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:24,149
l had put this signature five-six times.

1267
01:19:24,359 --> 01:19:26,293
Potty Sir was the manager that time.

1268
01:19:44,012 --> 01:19:45,809
l will do this.
But..

1269
01:19:46,014 --> 01:19:48,949
l have made a paper for Aluva Chandi.

1270
01:19:49,151 --> 01:19:50,914
You have to get it back.

1271
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:52,848
You will get money for what you are doing.

1272
01:19:53,054 --> 01:19:55,079
Why are you going into the details of that?

1273
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:56,154
l have to do.

1274
01:19:56,491 --> 01:20:00,791
lf l do something against what l have
already done, l will be trapped.

1275
01:20:00,996 --> 01:20:04,454
Ashokan SP told me to come here.

1276
01:20:04,666 --> 01:20:06,156
You know him (sir) very well.

1277
01:20:06,368 --> 01:20:09,496
lf l tell him, then he will destroy
this business.

1278
01:20:09,871 --> 01:20:10,838
l forgot that.

1279
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:12,006
Go away man.

1280
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:13,498
What you have thought?

1281
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:15,333
You can threaten me with
the name of one SP.

1282
01:20:15,544 --> 01:20:20,004
Chandi will decide whether SP's head should
be needed there to keep his hat.

1283
01:20:20,348 --> 01:20:22,043
Don't waste my time.
Go. Go away.

1284
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:23,473
l will go now.

1285
01:20:23,685 --> 01:20:25,016
But remember one thing.

1286
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:30,123
l will make you answer for making
fake document against my father.

1287
01:20:30,325 --> 01:20:34,557
l will make you to serve in
the jail after destroying

1288
01:20:34,763 --> 01:20:36,958
your hero pen, plantain stain
and other things.

1289
01:20:37,165 --> 01:20:38,689
Wait and see.
- You go.

1290
01:20:44,706 --> 01:20:48,506
''This property is not for sale.''

1291
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:53,041
This is the pathetic situation of
a farmer named Mathews

1292
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:55,648
who has kept a board like this.

1293
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:57,443
This is not in Bihar or
in Uttar Pradesh.

1294
01:20:57,652 --> 01:21:02,089
This incident took place in the small
village called Kodanadu in Kerala.

1295
01:21:02,290 --> 01:21:05,726
The trick that the real estate mafia
is playing to take over

1296
01:21:05,927 --> 01:21:08,054
Mathews land is shocking news
for the society.

1297
01:21:08,396 --> 01:21:09,226
ls it okay?

1298
01:21:09,598 --> 01:21:10,530
Perfect.

1299
01:21:10,999 --> 01:21:11,795
Set the camera in cow shed.

1300
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,729
Remaining we will shoot there.
- Okay.

1301
01:21:14,736 --> 01:21:16,795
At least l have shot this
farm house like this.

1302
01:21:17,105 --> 01:21:19,096
l want two-three foreigners
to talk in the next section.

1303
01:21:19,307 --> 01:21:20,365
lt would be an added advantage.

1304
01:21:20,976 --> 01:21:22,568
Now, no foreigner is here.

1305
01:21:22,777 --> 01:21:25,803
Because of these troubles,
they will also lose peace.

1306
01:21:26,014 --> 01:21:28,175
l told them not to come here now.

1307
01:21:28,683 --> 01:21:30,378
l will give this back to you
as your old heaven.

1308
01:21:30,585 --> 01:21:32,746
My mother has cross-marked
your composition earlier.

1309
01:21:32,954 --> 01:21:34,581
This is a penalty for that.

1310
01:21:35,991 --> 01:21:37,049
Will you show this today itself?

1311
01:21:37,259 --> 01:21:39,250
Yes. lt would be there in
the evening news.

1312
01:21:39,527 --> 01:21:41,427
l know there is no need to
tell all this to you.

1313
01:21:41,696 --> 01:21:45,188
Then too l am telling you that it
should make even a child to

1314
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:48,563
understand that this case was
framed against Jermias by SFC.

1315
01:21:48,770 --> 01:21:50,704
lt should come like that
in the TV.

1316
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:52,931
l have taken necessary
steps for that.

1317
01:21:53,141 --> 01:21:54,301
Let this news come.

1318
01:21:54,509 --> 01:21:56,807
lf it comes in Asia Vision, the other channel
will also give publicity for this.

1319
01:21:57,012 --> 01:21:58,445
Then people will start talking about it.

1320
01:21:58,647 --> 01:22:01,047
Then government will interfere in this.

1321
01:22:01,249 --> 01:22:03,217
All your problems will get solved.

1322
01:22:03,418 --> 01:22:04,544
Jesus.

1323
01:22:16,298 --> 01:22:17,287
Where is it?

1324
01:22:21,169 --> 01:22:21,726
Oh.

1325
01:22:23,972 --> 01:22:25,269
13 missed.

1326
01:22:25,473 --> 01:22:27,168
Whether the minister has resigned?

1327
01:22:30,345 --> 01:22:32,813
Hey, are you going to make me
an intelligent.

1328
01:22:33,014 --> 01:22:34,504
Won't you allow me to take
bath properly?

1329
01:22:34,716 --> 01:22:36,809
l have called you because
l want to meet you now.

1330
01:22:37,018 --> 01:22:39,486
One urgent matter is there.
- What urgent matter?

1331
01:22:39,688 --> 01:22:41,178
Sir that Kodanad..

1332
01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:46,985
Sir, that Konadanad property fellow Mathews
has given news against me in Asia Vision.

1333
01:22:47,195 --> 01:22:50,858
l am not scared of someone killing me by
shooting with gun or throwing bomb.

1334
01:22:51,066 --> 01:22:54,934
lf that channel gets that news,
they will harass me.

1335
01:22:55,136 --> 01:22:57,764
Sir, you please save me from
this at any cost.

1336
01:22:57,973 --> 01:23:02,069
Hey, after minister started
interfering in everything,

1337
01:23:02,277 --> 01:23:07,112
l don't have the power to call the
channel ad not even a small shop.

1338
01:23:07,315 --> 01:23:09,180
Then what will l do? Minister is urgently
waiting for me in Ramanilayam.

1339
01:23:09,384 --> 01:23:10,476
l want to go now.

1340
01:23:10,685 --> 01:23:13,176
You go and speak to someone else.
- Sir.

1341
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:15,520
Who is that?
- Bhuvnachandran.

1342
01:23:16,257 --> 01:23:17,690
Bhuvnan, what happened?

1343
01:23:19,127 --> 01:23:21,186
Did any channel people come there?

1344
01:23:21,396 --> 01:23:23,296
Yesudasan has told me that
there are cameras

1345
01:23:23,498 --> 01:23:25,728
which can be fitted even
in button and pen.

1346
01:23:26,201 --> 01:23:28,931
l am having doubt about
one girl who came here.

1347
01:23:29,504 --> 01:23:32,632
lf she has shot here, then we both
will go inside the jail.

1348
01:23:33,942 --> 01:23:34,704
Kaimal sir.
- Yes.

1349
01:23:34,909 --> 01:23:37,139
l have done discrepancies
in the SFC's file.

1350
01:23:37,345 --> 01:23:41,748
But you have called the MD
to make the case strong.

1351
01:23:42,317 --> 01:23:43,614
Not only that.

1352
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:47,845
lf an enquiry comes about
my land dealing,

1353
01:23:48,056 --> 01:23:52,390
then l have to tell about
the deed-land which you

1354
01:23:52,594 --> 01:23:55,563
have arranged for me after
taking Rs.10 lakhs from me.

1355
01:23:56,731 --> 01:23:58,892
Hey, will you say that?

1356
01:23:59,701 --> 01:24:00,690
When l am sinking,

1357
01:24:00,902 --> 01:24:03,234
l can catch the shoulder of
the person who is with me.

1358
01:24:04,072 --> 01:24:07,235
l will tell them that.
- Oh.

1359
01:24:08,543 --> 01:24:09,441
You come.

1360
01:24:10,311 --> 01:24:11,869
Oh, God, lt has become a problem.

1361
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:12,842
Don't say that.

1362
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:14,310
You also have a lot of relatives.

1363
01:24:14,516 --> 01:24:16,780
lt's necessary that you have to block this.

1364
01:24:24,793 --> 01:24:25,521
Hello.

1365
01:24:25,994 --> 01:24:28,690
The rain will become heavy in
Kerala in the next week.

1366
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:31,195
Kerala Climate observation centre
has informed this.

1367
01:24:31,399 --> 01:24:32,457
The people living on the sea shore
must be alert.

1368
01:24:32,667 --> 01:24:33,725
Hey, make manhole tomorrow.
- Yes.

1369
01:24:33,935 --> 01:24:35,027
Okay.
- Yes.

1370
01:24:35,203 --> 01:24:38,331
The party members have complained
that revenue minister

1371
01:24:38,506 --> 01:24:41,532
Pratapan is behaving against
the rule of party.

1372
01:24:41,709 --> 01:24:45,975
The minister is going against the party with
the support of the Chief Minister.

1373
01:24:46,181 --> 01:24:51,346
Prathan has informed that these are only
rumours and nothing like that was happening,

1374
01:24:51,553 --> 01:24:54,954
in the special interview with
Asia Vision at Ramanilayam.

1375
01:24:55,156 --> 01:24:56,646
l am serving for the people.

1376
01:24:56,858 --> 01:25:01,761
Then what allegation will come up
from the party against me.

1377
01:25:02,030 --> 01:25:05,557
These all are only rumour. These are
spreading due to some person rivalry.

1378
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,264
With the support of you
and the media,

1379
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:13,464
it is true that l could serve
people very well.

1380
01:25:14,909 --> 01:25:18,310
A family who has tried to save
their agricultural land

1381
01:25:18,513 --> 01:25:21,311
has fallen prey to the real estate mafia.

1382
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:25,644
We can see the shocking
report of this cruelty

1383
01:25:25,987 --> 01:25:28,615
which is prepared by our correspondent
Bedsy Varghese.

1384
01:25:28,823 --> 01:25:30,256
Sir.
ls it okay?

1385
01:25:45,607 --> 01:25:47,131
Sir, what is the problem
with that matter?

1386
01:25:47,342 --> 01:25:48,172
What has MD said?

1387
01:25:48,376 --> 01:25:49,707
We can't telecast that.
That's all.

1388
01:25:49,911 --> 01:25:53,540
Sir, earlier too all my investigative
stories had good rating.

1389
01:25:53,748 --> 01:25:54,271
Then what?

1390
01:25:54,482 --> 01:25:56,814
A channel must protect a lot of interests.

1391
01:25:57,018 --> 01:25:58,883
Everything can't be exposed to everyone.

1392
01:25:59,187 --> 01:25:59,846
You can go.

1393
01:26:05,793 --> 01:26:08,762
Let Chandi have good hold
in channel and everywhere.

1394
01:26:08,963 --> 01:26:13,024
Can a collector take decision
about your father's matter?

1395
01:26:13,234 --> 01:26:14,758
Yes. But.

1396
01:26:14,969 --> 01:26:16,459
l know the collector very well.

1397
01:26:16,671 --> 01:26:18,696
We have participated in
several meetings together.

1398
01:26:18,907 --> 01:26:20,340
She is very nice.

1399
01:26:20,542 --> 01:26:21,702
Let the paper come in front
of the collector.

1400
01:26:21,910 --> 01:26:22,968
l will talk to her.

1401
01:26:24,746 --> 01:26:27,510
Chandi, don't take this
legal notice to be so silly.

1402
01:26:27,715 --> 01:26:29,615
That Premela Surendran
is very cunning.

1403
01:26:29,817 --> 01:26:33,082
She is in Dubai now and
why she wants that flat urgently?

1404
01:26:33,288 --> 01:26:34,721
Nuisance.

1405
01:26:35,256 --> 01:26:38,020
You have taken Rs.10 lakhs
as advance promising

1406
01:26:38,226 --> 01:26:39,921
that you will allot flat within one year.

1407
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:42,619
Now, two years are over and you
haven't even built the base.

1408
01:26:42,830 --> 01:26:43,956
Then what will they do?

1409
01:26:44,766 --> 01:26:46,631
lf she goes for case,
then the remaining 39 people

1410
01:26:46,834 --> 01:26:48,324
who had paid money will also
go for case.

1411
01:26:48,536 --> 01:26:50,197
Section 420 is the case.
Cheating.

1412
01:26:50,405 --> 01:26:51,804
lt is very difficult to escape.

1413
01:26:52,006 --> 01:26:53,735
l had told you to start the
construction of the flat

1414
01:26:53,942 --> 01:26:55,569
when you got money from Mishra.

1415
01:26:55,777 --> 01:26:57,267
He has bought land with
all that money.

1416
01:26:57,478 --> 01:27:02,245
Sir, you please reduce your
craziness of buying land.

1417
01:27:02,450 --> 01:27:04,884
What happened to me because
of real estate business?

1418
01:27:05,086 --> 01:27:07,953
l have bought land in Kodanad with
the money of flat construction.

1419
01:27:08,156 --> 01:27:10,716
Now, l will get ten times more than the
amount which l spent for buying that.

1420
01:27:10,925 --> 01:27:15,055
After getting that amount, we will
start the construction of flat.

1421
01:27:15,263 --> 01:27:16,560
No use of telling all these.

1422
01:27:16,764 --> 01:27:17,788
lt should happen.

1423
01:27:17,999 --> 01:27:20,661
You vacate Mathews from there
as soon as possible.

1424
01:27:20,868 --> 01:27:23,564
Otherwise this case will
become complicated.

1425
01:27:33,014 --> 01:27:34,743
Sir, l haven't called you
because of the reason

1426
01:27:34,949 --> 01:27:36,678
that you have gone for
aunt's cremation.

1427
01:27:36,985 --> 01:27:38,976
Sir, did you know what
has happened here?

1428
01:27:40,054 --> 01:27:40,679
What?

1429
01:27:40,888 --> 01:27:43,755
Sir, l was shocked.

1430
01:27:43,958 --> 01:27:47,325
That Jermias's son had reported
to the Asia Vision

1431
01:27:47,528 --> 01:27:49,655
channel that we have framed that case.

1432
01:27:50,031 --> 01:27:52,192
We have somewhat suppressed
that case.

1433
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:53,628
Why did you suppress that?

1434
01:27:53,835 --> 01:27:55,769
What was the problem in
telecasting that case?

1435
01:27:55,970 --> 01:27:58,598
We haven't done any
discrepancies, right?- Yes.

1436
01:27:58,806 --> 01:28:01,536
But his son has come to see
you for marrying, right?

1437
01:28:01,843 --> 01:28:04,175
The news was that you have
made that case to

1438
01:28:04,379 --> 01:28:07,143
revenge him not for marrying you.

1439
01:28:08,783 --> 01:28:11,752
lf that news was telecasted,
then how will you face others?

1440
01:28:11,953 --> 01:28:13,250
Would you get a good proposal?

1441
01:28:13,888 --> 01:28:15,116
lf people are so cheap
to avoid repayment of loan,

1442
01:28:15,323 --> 01:28:16,881
then what will we do?

1443
01:28:17,925 --> 01:28:19,620
That may be MD.
He has called earlier.

1444
01:28:20,662 --> 01:28:21,151
Hello.

1445
01:28:21,362 --> 01:28:23,330
Did you come to know
about the problems

1446
01:28:23,531 --> 01:28:25,396
which Jermias created
to avoid repayment?

1447
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:26,294
Yes, sir.

1448
01:28:26,501 --> 01:28:28,662
Don't give any more time to him.

1449
01:28:28,870 --> 01:28:30,997
So, immediately, take action with
the collector's permission.

1450
01:28:31,205 --> 01:28:31,864
Sir.

1451
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:34,071
Collector is a strict person.

1452
01:28:34,275 --> 01:28:38,336
Maria, along with sending the paper,
you go and convince her everything.

1453
01:28:38,546 --> 01:28:39,240
Sir.

1454
01:28:44,686 --> 01:28:48,747
lf you say that a person has tried to
abuse you through channel,

1455
01:28:48,956 --> 01:28:49,980
l can't believe it.

1456
01:28:50,191 --> 01:28:51,681
Madam, you don't believe.

1457
01:28:51,893 --> 01:28:53,918
You can call them for hearing, right?

1458
01:28:54,128 --> 01:28:56,995
That time you will understand
what kind of people they are.

1459
01:28:57,198 --> 01:29:01,225
After that you decide whether
to extend the time.

1460
01:29:01,703 --> 01:29:02,169
Okay.

1461
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:03,268
We are meeting the minister
on 1 7th of this

1462
01:29:03,471 --> 01:29:05,701
month regarding the matter
of increasing salary.- Okay.

1463
01:29:06,974 --> 01:29:08,168
Do you know Kesavan Sir?

1464
01:29:08,376 --> 01:29:11,072
He is the state committee
member of union.- Yes.

1465
01:29:11,279 --> 01:29:12,177
Let's go.
- Okay.

1466
01:29:13,448 --> 01:29:14,540
Come here.

1467
01:29:15,450 --> 01:29:18,715
You do what l have told you.

1468
01:29:22,223 --> 01:29:22,780
Madam.

1469
01:29:24,025 --> 01:29:25,049
What collector told you?

1470
01:29:25,259 --> 01:29:27,454
She will call them for hearing.
- Okay.

1471
01:29:27,795 --> 01:29:29,888
What is the price of carrot?
- Rs.35.

1472
01:29:30,098 --> 01:29:33,090
Even 24 carat gold doesn't
have this much price.

1473
01:29:33,368 --> 01:29:35,529
You are asking the price of
everything for long time.

1474
01:29:35,737 --> 01:29:38,331
What you want?
- Don't be angry.

1475
01:29:38,539 --> 01:29:40,666
You told me that the price
of carrot is Rs.26, right?

1476
01:29:40,875 --> 01:29:41,637
lf l take 10 kg,
then would you give me

1477
01:29:41,843 --> 01:29:44,437
at the rate of Rs.20 per kg.
- Yes.

1478
01:29:45,747 --> 01:29:48,181
Then give me 1 kg tomato
for Rs.20.

1479
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:49,247
Give me fast.

1480
01:29:49,784 --> 01:29:51,308
How is it possible?
- Why so?

1481
01:29:52,553 --> 01:29:53,815
You are debating with the apt person.

1482
01:29:54,021 --> 01:29:55,181
You give her.

1483
01:29:55,656 --> 01:29:56,213
This is my son.

1484
01:29:56,424 --> 01:29:57,686
He doesn't know you, advocate.

1485
01:29:58,426 --> 01:30:00,587
What do you want?
- l..

1486
01:30:01,262 --> 01:30:02,092
Why are you here?

1487
01:30:02,296 --> 01:30:03,388
l have gone to your house.

1488
01:30:03,598 --> 01:30:04,997
Advocate, one minute.
l want to tell you something.

1489
01:30:11,606 --> 01:30:14,632
This is the hearing notice of collector
which came in my father's name.

1490
01:30:15,143 --> 01:30:18,044
ln this, it is written that
hearing is on 26th.

1491
01:30:18,246 --> 01:30:18,974
Today is 28th.

1492
01:30:19,180 --> 01:30:20,670
l got this letter today afternoon.

1493
01:30:22,850 --> 01:30:26,377
Today evening Nirmala teacher and collector
is participating in one meeting .

1494
01:30:26,587 --> 01:30:29,147
Teacher will inform everything
to the collector.

1495
01:30:29,824 --> 01:30:34,454
Then too, this... does Chandi have any role
behind this letter to come late?

1496
01:30:35,897 --> 01:30:39,424
This is my father's matter
That's why l am tensed.

1497
01:30:40,902 --> 01:30:43,132
This letter came in registered
post, right?- Yes.

1498
01:30:43,337 --> 01:30:45,567
You have the proof that you
got this letter today, right?

1499
01:30:45,773 --> 01:30:48,105
Let's go and meet the collector
tomorrow with your father.

1500
01:30:48,643 --> 01:30:51,134
Will collector cross-examine
my father?

1501
01:30:51,846 --> 01:30:53,507
l can't even tolerate that.

1502
01:30:54,749 --> 01:30:57,343
Collector doesn't have the
power to hang anyone.

1503
01:30:58,386 --> 01:31:01,184
Mathews, you go.
See you tomorrow.

1504
01:31:41,996 --> 01:31:44,658
Did you see the advocate?
- Yes.

1505
01:31:45,833 --> 01:31:46,492
What happened?

1506
01:31:47,468 --> 01:31:50,562
Some people of Chandi are
standing on the road.

1507
01:31:50,771 --> 01:31:53,501
The 'Evening' newspaper reporter
Sivan Nedungoli is also with them.

1508
01:31:53,708 --> 01:31:55,403
He is having the character
of some creeper.

1509
01:31:55,610 --> 01:31:57,043
He will go everywhere.

1510
01:31:57,378 --> 01:31:58,811
What she said?

1511
01:32:00,014 --> 01:32:01,572
Advocate told me that nothing
is there to worry.

1512
01:32:01,782 --> 01:32:06,014
Oh. Let tomorrow's day get
over soon, Jesus.

1513
01:32:08,489 --> 01:32:10,423
Hello.

1514
01:32:10,758 --> 01:32:12,385
Yes. l will give him.

1515
01:32:12,593 --> 01:32:13,753
Who are you?

1516
01:32:14,495 --> 01:32:15,757
Hello.

1517
01:32:15,963 --> 01:32:16,930
Mother, who is that?

1518
01:32:17,632 --> 01:32:18,599
l don't know who it was.

1519
01:32:18,799 --> 01:32:20,164
He asked me whether Jermias is here.

1520
01:32:20,368 --> 01:32:21,835
When l said yes, he cut the phone.

1521
01:32:22,036 --> 01:32:23,628
Now it is three-four times.

1522
01:32:43,658 --> 01:32:46,821
Sudhir. You come to my house
with your vehicle now.

1523
01:32:47,028 --> 01:32:48,791
Some problem will happen
here now. Urgent.

1524
01:32:50,932 --> 01:32:53,730
Father, get ready fast.

1525
01:32:53,935 --> 01:32:55,732
What happened?
- Nothing.

1526
01:32:55,937 --> 01:32:58,405
Police might come here now.

1527
01:32:58,606 --> 01:32:59,470
Police?

1528
01:32:59,774 --> 01:33:01,401
Before hearing..

1529
01:33:01,609 --> 01:33:03,577
We got the paper of hearing 2 days later.

1530
01:33:03,778 --> 01:33:05,143
l feel something fishy in this.

1531
01:33:05,346 --> 01:33:06,745
Phone calls have come to enquire
whether you are here.

1532
01:33:06,948 --> 01:33:07,710
Newspaper reporter is also
there outside.

1533
01:33:07,915 --> 01:33:10,884
l feel something is going to happen.
Maybe l am feeling so.

1534
01:33:11,085 --> 01:33:13,076
But l am not ready to take
any risk in my father's matter.

1535
01:33:13,921 --> 01:33:16,014
As a precaution, father,
you go away from here.

1536
01:33:16,223 --> 01:33:17,485
Why are you getting so scared?

1537
01:33:17,692 --> 01:33:18,624
Let police come.

1538
01:33:18,826 --> 01:33:20,293
l haven't killed anyone
or robbed anything.

1539
01:33:20,494 --> 01:33:23,895
Father, if police takes you from here,
then l can't tolerate that.

1540
01:33:24,098 --> 01:33:25,190
Father, you get ready fast.

1541
01:33:27,802 --> 01:33:30,635
Mother, you pack father's
two dresses.- Okay.

1542
01:33:30,838 --> 01:33:31,463
What happened?

1543
01:33:31,672 --> 01:33:35,108
Mother, you go take father's brush,
paste and soap.

1544
01:33:54,095 --> 01:33:54,720
Take.

1545
01:33:55,296 --> 01:33:58,891
Shall l call my son Bobby for keeping
brother in his wife's uncle's house.

1546
01:33:59,100 --> 01:34:00,124
No need of all that.

1547
01:34:00,568 --> 01:34:02,593
Sudhir is having a lot of
relatives and friends.

1548
01:34:02,803 --> 01:34:04,668
He will take care of father.

1549
01:34:07,274 --> 01:34:08,536
What is this?

1550
01:34:08,943 --> 01:34:10,774
What has happened here
for you to cry?

1551
01:34:10,978 --> 01:34:13,708
Without doing any mistake..
Thinking of that..

1552
01:34:13,914 --> 01:34:16,576
A lot of famous people including
Mahatma Gandhi and

1553
01:34:16,784 --> 01:34:18,809
AKG served in the jail without
doing any crime.

1554
01:34:19,186 --> 01:34:20,483
l am not a famous person.

1555
01:34:20,688 --> 01:34:23,748
But l don't have any problem to
serve in the jail for some time.

1556
01:34:23,958 --> 01:34:25,323
l am saying this to you also.

1557
01:34:25,526 --> 01:34:31,590
lf a warrant is made, you don't
sell this house to save me.

1558
01:34:31,799 --> 01:34:32,265
Father.

1559
01:34:32,466 --> 01:34:33,831
That is equivalent to my death.

1560
01:34:34,235 --> 01:34:35,896
Father, l know your feelings.

1561
01:35:03,197 --> 01:35:04,357
Slowly, Slowly.

1562
01:35:06,233 --> 01:35:08,030
What? What happened?
- Nothing. Nothing

1563
01:35:08,235 --> 01:35:09,202
What is this?
- Nothing. l will tell you later.

1564
01:35:18,079 --> 01:35:19,205
Sudhir, you go.

1565
01:35:24,351 --> 01:35:25,340
Mother, you don't worry.

1566
01:35:25,553 --> 01:35:26,952
Nothing will happen to father.

1567
01:35:30,257 --> 01:35:30,985
Mathai.

1568
01:35:32,860 --> 01:35:35,886
Move the vehicle.
Otherwise l will hit. Fool.

1569
01:35:36,097 --> 01:35:37,155
lf you have courage, then you hit.

1570
01:35:37,364 --> 01:35:38,023
This is public road.

1571
01:35:38,232 --> 01:35:39,927
We will put our vehicle as we like.

1572
01:35:40,134 --> 01:35:41,362
Hey. What is this?

1573
01:35:41,569 --> 01:35:43,230
You please remove your vehicle.

1574
01:35:43,437 --> 01:35:44,927
Why are you taking your father
in such a difficulty?

1575
01:35:45,139 --> 01:35:45,901
Now, police will come and take him.

1576
01:35:46,107 --> 01:35:47,699
Do you want to take my father?

1577
01:36:56,343 --> 01:36:57,037
Move.

1578
01:37:04,251 --> 01:37:05,081
Hey, Sudhir.

1579
01:37:07,855 --> 01:37:08,583
Sudhir.

1580
01:37:09,557 --> 01:37:10,717
Remove the vehicle.

1581
01:37:12,693 --> 01:37:13,387
Go.

1582
01:37:25,973 --> 01:37:27,736
You go away with my father.
Go.

1583
01:37:51,265 --> 01:37:52,095
Hey, come.

1584
01:38:01,375 --> 01:38:02,103
Go.

1585
01:38:10,084 --> 01:38:11,244
Hey, move.

1586
01:38:14,021 --> 01:38:17,479
Who is Jermias?
- My father.

1587
01:38:17,691 --> 01:38:19,682
He is having an arrest warrant
under section 65.

1588
01:38:19,894 --> 01:38:22,829
For that why did you bring hand-cuff?
My father is not a murderer.

1589
01:38:23,030 --> 01:38:25,555
Hey, are you teaching me
how to take culprits?

1590
01:38:25,766 --> 01:38:27,927
Sir, you go and take him
in custody from inside.

1591
01:38:28,135 --> 01:38:28,760
Sir.

1592
01:38:29,270 --> 01:38:32,637
He has just now gone away from
here with his friend Sudhir.

1593
01:38:32,907 --> 01:38:34,534
Where has he gone?
- l don't know.

1594
01:38:34,742 --> 01:38:35,731
Tell me the truth.
Otherwise l will thrash you.

1595
01:38:35,943 --> 01:38:36,568
Sir.

1596
01:38:37,344 --> 01:38:39,812
lf the arrest will be late, then the
problem will be more complicated.

1597
01:38:40,014 --> 01:38:41,106
That will become news.

1598
01:38:41,315 --> 01:38:43,442
There is no use of having
influence in TV.

1599
01:38:43,651 --> 01:38:45,141
For them news is important.

1600
01:38:45,352 --> 01:38:48,412
They will show in the TV as inscrutable
culprit has gone hiding.

1601
01:38:48,622 --> 01:38:51,989
Do you want to give your father
such a shame in this old age?

1602
01:38:52,826 --> 01:38:54,020
Tell me where is he.

1603
01:38:54,228 --> 01:38:55,820
We will go and take him in custody.

1604
01:38:56,931 --> 01:39:01,197
You don't think that you can sleep after
getting my father in custody.

1605
01:39:01,502 --> 01:39:05,563
You go & tell the people who has sent you here
that none of their motive will be fulfilled.

1606
01:39:05,773 --> 01:39:07,035
Whom are you threatening?

1607
01:39:07,241 --> 01:39:10,176
l will arrest your father within 24 hours.

1608
01:39:11,378 --> 01:39:12,208
Do that.

1609
01:39:29,330 --> 01:39:32,993
Our village is going to develop.
This incident is a part of that.

1610
01:39:34,335 --> 01:39:36,701
They should have shown Jermias'
photo little bigger.

1611
01:39:36,904 --> 01:39:37,802
Photo is not clear too.

1612
01:39:38,005 --> 01:39:40,701
He hasn't got Oscar.
He got arrest warrant.

1613
01:39:40,908 --> 01:39:44,207
Arrest warrant not for
repaying the debt.

1614
01:39:46,447 --> 01:39:48,074
Father, you are the president
of township committee.

1615
01:39:48,282 --> 01:39:49,647
Then where were you gone?

1616
01:39:51,418 --> 01:39:54,444
Remove Jermias from the church
committee as soon as possible.

1617
01:39:55,856 --> 01:40:00,225
This is shameful that the church committee
member is hiding because of a case.

1618
01:40:00,527 --> 01:40:01,824
Will township come here?

1619
01:40:02,029 --> 01:40:03,428
ls there any news about
that in newspaper?

1620
01:40:03,630 --> 01:40:04,892
There is no doubt about that.

1621
01:40:05,099 --> 01:40:09,934
lf Jermias will go to jail, Mathai and family
won't stay here because of shame.

1622
01:40:10,204 --> 01:40:12,764
For repaying his father's debt,
Mathai has to sell his land.

1623
01:40:12,973 --> 01:40:17,967
Let police catch Jermias,
then township will surely come here.

1624
01:40:19,079 --> 01:40:24,244
l want to do practicing for the security
job by catching torch and stick.

1625
01:40:36,397 --> 01:40:38,888
l have told you that day itself
that don't go for fights.

1626
01:40:39,099 --> 01:40:40,123
What did you tell me that time?

1627
01:40:40,334 --> 01:40:41,596
l am telling this for getting
policy for me.

1628
01:40:41,802 --> 01:40:42,632
Are you happy now?

1629
01:40:42,836 --> 01:40:45,134
Uncle, what you want now?
- l am so sad.

1630
01:40:45,339 --> 01:40:47,807
Jermias is my brother who had taken
care of me in my childhood.

1631
01:40:48,008 --> 01:40:50,442
l can't tolerate all this.

1632
01:40:50,644 --> 01:40:53,613
You sell this house and land as soon
as possible and finish the case.

1633
01:40:55,349 --> 01:40:57,681
l am not planning to sell
this house and land.

1634
01:40:57,885 --> 01:40:58,749
My father's opinion is also the same.

1635
01:40:58,952 --> 01:41:00,351
Jermias is a prestigious person.

1636
01:41:00,554 --> 01:41:01,646
He would say that only.

1637
01:41:01,855 --> 01:41:03,914
Oh! That you have taken as
an opportunity, right?

1638
01:41:04,124 --> 01:41:06,285
What he is saying when a bad time
came for his father.

1639
01:41:06,593 --> 01:41:07,890
What you are going to do?

1640
01:41:08,095 --> 01:41:10,563
Are you going to file case against govt.?
Or going to catch flag.

1641
01:41:10,764 --> 01:41:11,526
He is my father.

1642
01:41:11,732 --> 01:41:12,892
l know what to do.

1643
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:15,033
Don't try to escape by saying all these.

1644
01:41:15,235 --> 01:41:16,964
This is the matter of our family.

1645
01:41:17,171 --> 01:41:19,139
No one in Puthenpurakkal house
has seen the jail.

1646
01:41:19,339 --> 01:41:22,308
Then you catch a vehicle and
go for a tour to the jail.

1647
01:41:22,776 --> 01:41:25,074
When we were suffering here, no one from
Puthenpurakkal had come here.

1648
01:41:25,279 --> 01:41:26,473
You people came here after
we made all these.

1649
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:27,942
Son.
- Mother, you don't talk.

1650
01:41:28,148 --> 01:41:29,410
This is not because of love
to my father.

1651
01:41:29,616 --> 01:41:30,810
He has come to support the villagers.

1652
01:41:31,018 --> 01:41:32,542
l won't send my father to jail.

1653
01:41:32,753 --> 01:41:34,414
For that, l won't need anyone's help.

1654
01:41:34,888 --> 01:41:36,480
l know that you will say this only.

1655
01:41:36,690 --> 01:41:38,521
At last for saving your cows
and agriculture,

1656
01:41:38,725 --> 01:41:40,317
you will sacrifice your father too.

1657
01:41:44,531 --> 01:41:47,022
Oh. New relatives have come.

1658
01:41:47,801 --> 01:41:50,531
Listen to these people who don't know
about the value of family.

1659
01:41:50,737 --> 01:41:55,003
A person who doesn't help his father
in bad time won't improve in life.

1660
01:41:59,413 --> 01:42:03,440
Blaming is an easy way to dessert the
people when they have some problem.

1661
01:42:04,151 --> 01:42:05,083
Did you meet collector?
- Yes.

1662
01:42:05,285 --> 01:42:06,343
Come. Sit inside.

1663
01:42:11,325 --> 01:42:12,553
Collector is innocent in this matter.

1664
01:42:12,759 --> 01:42:14,727
She had issued the notice on 15th itself.

1665
01:42:14,928 --> 01:42:16,896
The collector's office clerk has
blocked the letter.

1666
01:42:19,099 --> 01:42:21,431
Without the knowledge of collector?
- Yes.

1667
01:42:21,635 --> 01:42:23,569
This clerk is union's person.

1668
01:42:23,770 --> 01:42:25,863
lt is difficult to take action against him.

1669
01:42:26,073 --> 01:42:28,541
Not only that, you hadn't gone
for the hearing.

1670
01:42:29,042 --> 01:42:33,741
The office staffs and SFC has told her
that you people are problematic.

1671
01:42:33,947 --> 01:42:37,212
Believing that collector has signed
the arrest warrant.

1672
01:42:37,417 --> 01:42:40,318
lf she tries to withdraw that,
then it would be a problem for her.

1673
01:42:41,388 --> 01:42:44,482
Anyway, l got one benefit from their
excitement for arresting my father.

1674
01:42:45,592 --> 01:42:48,083
Usually, for arresting as per section 65,

1675
01:42:48,462 --> 01:42:51,659
the notice for that will be sent to the village
office through the Tahsildar (official)..

1676
01:42:51,865 --> 01:42:55,494
to take the report showing whether
the defendant is able to repay the debt.

1677
01:42:56,870 --> 01:42:58,861
Advocate Sunita has told me that
she will get a stay order..

1678
01:42:59,072 --> 01:43:01,597
tomorrow itself from the court for this arrest
warrant which was not as per rules.

1679
01:43:01,808 --> 01:43:03,139
How is your father there?

1680
01:43:03,510 --> 01:43:04,909
Sudhir has called me once.

1681
01:43:05,112 --> 01:43:08,081
l told him not to call because
police might trace the number.

1682
01:43:08,649 --> 01:43:09,843
Father won't have any problem there.

1683
01:43:10,050 --> 01:43:12,018
Sudhir, his friend and family is there.

1684
01:43:12,219 --> 01:43:13,618
Whoever is there,

1685
01:43:13,820 --> 01:43:15,151
if swelling forms on your father's
leg do you think

1686
01:43:15,355 --> 01:43:17,186
that he will tell that to someone there?

1687
01:43:17,791 --> 01:43:20,419
He will tolerate that without
telling anyone.

1688
01:43:20,794 --> 01:43:22,091
While thinking about that..

1689
01:43:39,980 --> 01:43:43,074
Mother doesn't know the truth.

1690
01:43:45,085 --> 01:43:47,212
Collector has already signed the warrant.

1691
01:43:47,421 --> 01:43:50,049
They can proceed with that
in the legal way.

1692
01:43:50,524 --> 01:43:52,287
We will get little time.

1693
01:43:52,826 --> 01:43:54,293
But we can't avoid the arrest.

1694
01:43:58,599 --> 01:44:01,796
l am not hesitated to sell this land
and repay the debt.

1695
01:44:03,003 --> 01:44:07,064
lf l do so, then my father will become
a robber in front of others.

1696
01:44:09,076 --> 01:44:11,067
lf l haven't finished that debt,
then it would be a grave problem.

1697
01:44:11,278 --> 01:44:12,404
l don't know what to do.

1698
01:44:13,614 --> 01:44:16,811
The villagers whom l thought to be
with me have become enemies.

1699
01:44:17,284 --> 01:44:20,219
When Abdu told police about my father,
l was shocked.

1700
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:21,512
What we have done?

1701
01:44:24,324 --> 01:44:25,985
l want to cry loudly.

1702
01:44:26,193 --> 01:44:28,718
But everybody is looking at me
for their relief.

1703
01:44:30,030 --> 01:44:31,497
l can't cry.

1704
01:44:39,039 --> 01:44:42,099
While other studies spent their time
towards studying and playing..

1705
01:44:43,610 --> 01:44:47,102
While l was working by sweating
under the sun..

1706
01:44:48,015 --> 01:44:49,710
l have seen a lot of dreams about
this farm and living..

1707
01:44:49,916 --> 01:44:54,683
here happily with my father and mother.

1708
01:44:56,857 --> 01:44:59,883
My entire struggling and life was for that.

1709
01:45:05,032 --> 01:45:09,196
l won't allow Aluva Chandi to
torment my struggle and life.

1710
01:45:10,671 --> 01:45:12,263
l won't sacrifice my father.

1711
01:45:12,806 --> 01:45:14,239
l won't give him my land.

1712
01:45:18,478 --> 01:45:23,506
Bedsy, you please do
a TV programme favouring

1713
01:45:23,717 --> 01:45:25,810
Chandi's township when l tell you.

1714
01:45:26,553 --> 01:45:29,215
The statement of tourism minister
and others should be there.

1715
01:45:29,690 --> 01:45:31,214
Mathews, what do you mean?

1716
01:45:32,392 --> 01:45:36,226
l will tell you afterwards.
l will tell you afterwards

1717
01:45:41,835 --> 01:45:43,700
Hello.
Yes.

1718
01:45:44,271 --> 01:45:45,101
Yes. What?

1719
01:45:47,407 --> 01:45:48,101
Okay.

1720
01:45:50,944 --> 01:45:53,071
Who was that?
- Mathews.

1721
01:45:55,749 --> 01:46:01,051
He might not get peace while thinking
about his father's warrant.

1722
01:46:01,254 --> 01:46:04,087
Dear, will they get stay order tomorrow?
- Yes.

1723
01:46:04,291 --> 01:46:06,555
Mathews called me not for asking that.

1724
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:10,196
He wants the details of Chandi's case.

1725
01:46:10,397 --> 01:46:12,388
What for?
- l don't know.

1726
01:46:12,599 --> 01:46:16,968
But l have told you that Mathews
likes his father very much.

1727
01:46:17,571 --> 01:46:20,904
He will do anything for who he loves.

1728
01:46:21,708 --> 01:46:23,437
Mathews is planning something.

1729
01:46:23,710 --> 01:46:28,477
lf Chandi comes to know that
you are enquiring about cases.

1730
01:46:29,216 --> 01:46:33,676
lf l enquire in the record room,
l will get the details of all cases.

1731
01:46:33,887 --> 01:46:35,684
Chandi won't come to know about that.

1732
01:46:36,323 --> 01:46:38,223
Then too, they are not good people.

1733
01:46:38,592 --> 01:46:41,459
You give all help to Mathews
related to law.

1734
01:46:41,762 --> 01:46:42,751
Besides that..

1735
01:46:43,797 --> 01:46:47,289
Mother, it is the need of common
people who buy

1736
01:46:47,501 --> 01:46:55,203
vegetable for higher price, to save the
agricultural land of people like Mathews.

1737
01:46:56,643 --> 01:46:58,167
That is also right.

1738
01:47:25,338 --> 01:47:26,862
l don't have any problem.

1739
01:47:27,073 --> 01:47:30,167
l stayed at Sudhir's friend's house
like how l stay here.

1740
01:47:31,478 --> 01:47:34,106
l was sitting in the car from court
to here in one position.

1741
01:47:34,314 --> 01:47:36,441
You go and arrange the bed.
- Okay.

1742
01:47:37,984 --> 01:47:40,145
Raahal, bring some water to drink.

1743
01:47:40,487 --> 01:47:41,511
l will bring now.

1744
01:47:42,122 --> 01:47:42,952
Come here.

1745
01:47:43,790 --> 01:47:46,486
We have got the stay order,
then too, they have started..

1746
01:47:46,660 --> 01:47:49,424
the legal proceeding to arrest me again.

1747
01:47:49,596 --> 01:47:51,689
lf it happens so, then when would
the arrest take place.

1748
01:47:55,769 --> 01:47:59,068
l asked just for my knowledge.

1749
01:48:01,107 --> 01:48:02,131
Nothing will happen.

1750
01:48:03,443 --> 01:48:04,808
l won't allow that.

1751
01:48:08,014 --> 01:48:08,742
Come.

1752
01:48:15,088 --> 01:48:18,023
Most of Chandi's cases are
related to fighting.

1753
01:48:18,225 --> 01:48:21,160
Recently one case was filed
against Chandi.

1754
01:48:22,095 --> 01:48:26,794
Cheating case for promising
to allot flat.

1755
01:48:27,601 --> 01:48:29,330
He has taken bail in that case.

1756
01:48:29,536 --> 01:48:32,061
But it is difficult for him to escape.

1757
01:48:32,839 --> 01:48:34,807
Who has filed the case?

1758
01:48:35,008 --> 01:48:37,738
One Prameela Surendran.
Settled in Dubai.

1759
01:48:39,212 --> 01:48:41,237
One interesting case is there.

1760
01:48:41,448 --> 01:48:44,110
l came to know about this through
spy work in bar association.

1761
01:48:44,885 --> 01:48:50,346
Some people has filed an injunction suite
for getting road through one land.

1762
01:48:51,157 --> 01:48:53,523
Chandi has kept advocate
against that case.

1763
01:48:54,461 --> 01:48:57,157
The interesting thing is that Chandi is
not the owner of that land.

1764
01:48:57,364 --> 01:48:58,058
Then.

1765
01:48:58,265 --> 01:49:00,927
That is government's deed-land.
- Means.

1766
01:49:01,134 --> 01:49:04,126
Government has given that land
to poor people on deed.

1767
01:49:05,272 --> 01:49:08,503
Where is it?
- Near Vaipin lake.

1768
01:49:13,813 --> 01:49:14,575
l am agreeing.

1769
01:49:14,781 --> 01:49:18,114
The arrest was flopped because
l was in hurry.

1770
01:49:18,752 --> 01:49:21,778
Now, you move as per rules
and regulations.

1771
01:49:21,988 --> 01:49:25,253
Don't take lot of time..

1772
01:49:25,458 --> 01:49:30,259
l am mad here because of flat,
case and Mishra.

1773
01:49:30,463 --> 01:49:31,157
That l know.

1774
01:49:31,364 --> 01:49:34,197
That's why l sent the paper
immediately to the Tahsildar.

1775
01:49:34,401 --> 01:49:35,834
There also, l am having my men.

1776
01:49:36,036 --> 01:49:38,834
Sir, some office formalities are there.

1777
01:49:39,906 --> 01:49:42,306
Understood.
You tell me.

1778
01:49:42,509 --> 01:49:44,409
Now itself l will send that
in Jose's hand.

1779
01:49:44,611 --> 01:49:46,806
But the paper must reach
the village office.

1780
01:49:47,013 --> 01:49:49,447
lf it reach there, then no problem.

1781
01:49:49,649 --> 01:49:53,676
Then a nice report will go to the
top level about his father.

1782
01:49:55,155 --> 01:49:55,746
Oh yes.

1783
01:49:55,956 --> 01:49:58,447
Kesavan, we will meet afterwards.

1784
01:49:58,658 --> 01:49:59,590
Okay.

1785
01:50:03,063 --> 01:50:03,927
Take the vehicle.

1786
01:50:21,748 --> 01:50:22,612
Two cups of tea.

1787
01:50:25,318 --> 01:50:28,719
Brother, government had given this land
as deed for poor people, right?

1788
01:50:28,922 --> 01:50:30,287
Where are you coming from?
Newspaper?

1789
01:50:30,490 --> 01:50:31,457
No. No.

1790
01:50:31,658 --> 01:50:33,683
We heard that we will get deed
land at a lower price.

1791
01:50:33,893 --> 01:50:35,793
You should have come little early.

1792
01:50:35,996 --> 01:50:37,520
Chandi sir has just gone from here.

1793
01:50:37,998 --> 01:50:39,522
Aluva Chandi sir.

1794
01:50:39,733 --> 01:50:41,166
This land is with him now.

1795
01:50:41,368 --> 01:50:44,963
l will speak to him.
But you give me commission.

1796
01:50:45,171 --> 01:50:47,901
Government has given this land
to poor people, right?

1797
01:50:48,108 --> 01:50:49,700
How Aluva Chandi got that?

1798
01:50:50,276 --> 01:50:53,211
Sir, if you know the priest,

1799
01:50:53,413 --> 01:50:54,710
then there is no problem in getting
the offering from the temple.

1800
01:50:55,482 --> 01:50:57,245
Look. Sand is unloading there.

1801
01:50:57,550 --> 01:51:00,144
This is the understanding between
irrigation department and Chandi Sir.

1802
01:51:00,353 --> 01:51:03,413
They are dredging the lake
to increase the depth.

1803
01:51:03,623 --> 01:51:05,557
They want to put that sand somewhere.

1804
01:51:05,759 --> 01:51:08,785
The sand of the lake is mixed with
red sand and dumped here.

1805
01:51:08,995 --> 01:51:12,556
After filling this land,
they will stop dredging and go.

1806
01:51:13,633 --> 01:51:16,067
lf l come to know the people
who got this land,

1807
01:51:17,270 --> 01:51:19,738
then l can buy it at a very lower cost.

1808
01:51:20,140 --> 01:51:25,100
Sir, the collector has distributed the land
deed to the people three months back.

1809
01:51:25,412 --> 01:51:27,403
But no one in this village has got it.

1810
01:51:27,614 --> 01:51:29,639
l don't know who has got it.

1811
01:51:30,450 --> 01:51:31,781
Tea.
- l will take now.

1812
01:51:44,798 --> 01:51:45,992
This is the ratios of report.

1813
01:51:46,499 --> 01:51:48,364
lt may contain more details that you
have seen in the TV.

1814
01:51:48,601 --> 01:51:50,125
The district collector
Sandhya Ramachandran has

1815
01:51:50,336 --> 01:51:52,031
inaugurated the distribution of
five cent land's document

1816
01:51:52,238 --> 01:51:55,674
for the people below poverty level
at Vaipin in Eranakulam.

1817
01:51:56,876 --> 01:52:02,007
Government has given the 2.5 acres of land
near Vaipin for 50 poor people.

1818
01:52:02,215 --> 01:52:03,273
Please stop.

1819
01:52:07,554 --> 01:52:10,489
ls there any chance to get the
voice of announcement?

1820
01:52:10,690 --> 01:52:11,281
Yes.

1821
01:52:13,493 --> 01:52:16,656
Haseena Beevi,
Pazhayapalli Purayidam, Mattancherry.

1822
01:52:16,863 --> 01:52:20,321
Lorence Anthony, Thekkekandathi,
Pishuki Road Varapuzha.

1823
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:23,496
Sukumaran, Thaiparambil House,
Thottakakam.

1824
01:52:23,703 --> 01:52:26,638
Seetalekshmi, Kaitharathil house
Chullikkal.

1825
01:52:40,253 --> 01:52:41,049
Mathachan.

1826
01:52:41,454 --> 01:52:43,581
l will do that.
l will finish this now.

1827
01:52:43,790 --> 01:52:44,415
You go man.

1828
01:52:44,624 --> 01:52:46,023
After seeing these clouds,
should l stay idle?

1829
01:52:56,369 --> 01:52:58,667
What rain is this?
Agriculture will get spoiled.

1830
01:52:58,872 --> 01:52:59,839
lf water rises here,
then it will be a problem.

1831
01:53:00,039 --> 01:53:02,337
That's why l am flowing this
into the rainwater hole.

1832
01:53:02,542 --> 01:53:03,873
Sir, did you enquire about that?

1833
01:53:04,077 --> 01:53:07,843
The land deed means government
giving land to the people.

1834
01:53:08,047 --> 01:53:09,446
That all we know.

1835
01:53:09,649 --> 01:53:12,117
What happened in this case?
You tell me that.

1836
01:53:12,485 --> 01:53:13,417
Let me tell.

1837
01:53:13,586 --> 01:53:15,178
There are several forms of land deed.

1838
01:53:15,388 --> 01:53:18,824
ln that the land which the tribal
get won't be sold.

1839
01:53:19,092 --> 01:53:23,791
Then the land given for agriculture like
purpose can be used only for that only.

1840
01:53:23,930 --> 01:53:25,955
Besides this, one more land
deed is there.

1841
01:53:26,166 --> 01:53:28,134
ln that land deed, there would be
a clause that it can be

1842
01:53:28,334 --> 01:53:30,302
transacted only after
some period of time.

1843
01:53:30,503 --> 01:53:31,902
Some deed doesn't have clause also.

1844
01:53:32,105 --> 01:53:33,231
My doubt is that the land-deed which

1845
01:53:33,439 --> 01:53:35,304
you have told me might belong
to this category.

1846
01:53:35,508 --> 01:53:36,475
Let it be.

1847
01:53:36,676 --> 01:53:37,734
Here that is not the problem.

1848
01:53:37,944 --> 01:53:39,809
Here, the ownership itself is fake.

1849
01:53:40,013 --> 01:53:42,641
We have enquired in the four addresses
which we heard in the TV.

1850
01:53:42,849 --> 01:53:44,407
But no one is there in that address.

1851
01:53:44,617 --> 01:53:48,417
Chandi has brought 50 land-deed
in fake name with fake people.

1852
01:53:48,621 --> 01:53:49,815
l am also saying that.

1853
01:53:50,023 --> 01:53:51,888
lf someone is having good hold
in revenue department.

1854
01:53:52,091 --> 01:53:53,922
then they can get land-deed
in fake names.

1855
01:53:54,127 --> 01:53:55,992
After that they will keep that
in hand for some time.

1856
01:53:56,196 --> 01:53:58,221
Chandi is also doing the
same thing now.

1857
01:53:59,566 --> 01:54:01,932
When he become sure that
no one is having doubt,

1858
01:54:02,135 --> 01:54:06,299
then he will make document showing that
these 50 people has sold that land to him.

1859
01:54:06,506 --> 01:54:08,098
lf people like Bhuvnachandran
is there with him,

1860
01:54:08,308 --> 01:54:10,902
then it is not difficult for him
to make documents.

1861
01:54:11,344 --> 01:54:12,208
That..

1862
01:54:12,412 --> 01:54:14,380
He can't make documents like that showing
that he bought the land, right?

1863
01:54:14,581 --> 01:54:16,105
For that he has to register that
in the register office, right?

1864
01:54:16,316 --> 01:54:18,876
ls it possible to do that without
these 50 sellers

1865
01:54:19,085 --> 01:54:20,518
who come with their identity card?

1866
01:54:20,720 --> 01:54:24,850
Hey, here register office is not ruling
by registrar and sub-registrar.

1867
01:54:25,058 --> 01:54:26,355
lt is Mahatma Gandhi.

1868
01:54:27,894 --> 01:54:29,293
The Gandhi in the currency not.

1869
01:54:29,495 --> 01:54:30,223
That itself.

1870
01:54:30,430 --> 01:54:34,526
lf we give money, everything can be
possible in majority of register office.

1871
01:55:08,334 --> 01:55:12,737
The village officer's report showing
Jermias son..

1872
01:55:12,939 --> 01:55:16,238
..possess property more than
the value of debt will be there..

1873
01:55:16,442 --> 01:55:19,309
..on the table of collector tomorrow.

1874
01:55:19,879 --> 01:55:25,681
Kesavan, it is your responsibility to get the
arrest warrant by the collector.

1875
01:55:25,885 --> 01:55:27,079
That l agreed.

1876
01:55:32,892 --> 01:55:38,592
You should take that old man to
the station with celebration.- Okay.

1877
01:55:39,699 --> 01:55:43,601
l have made the arrangement for all
that through counsellor Papachan.

1878
01:55:44,370 --> 01:55:46,270
His father should be pained.

1879
01:55:46,472 --> 01:55:48,770
Then only he will come.

1880
01:55:54,480 --> 01:55:57,108
Do you make delay in sending this?
Take.

1881
01:55:57,317 --> 01:56:01,276
Send this or you directly handover
this to Kodanad station.

1882
01:56:07,060 --> 01:56:08,960
You stand here.

1883
01:56:09,162 --> 01:56:11,960
Cl has agreed to slow down the
vehicle when they reach here.

1884
01:56:12,165 --> 01:56:14,463
lt's not possible to go
through this road.

1885
01:56:14,667 --> 01:56:18,797
lt's good that you haven't repaired
the Panchayat (village council) road.

1886
01:56:20,340 --> 01:56:22,399
Chandi sir, l am ready here.

1887
01:56:22,608 --> 01:56:24,974
l am waiting for SFC's people
and village officer.

1888
01:56:25,178 --> 01:56:28,545
l have just now blocked the village officer
and the people from SFC.

1889
01:56:29,082 --> 01:56:31,573
You should wait for some time...

1890
01:56:32,418 --> 01:56:33,248
What happened?

1891
01:56:33,586 --> 01:56:36,987
He has agreed to sell the land.

1892
01:56:41,627 --> 01:56:44,255
Mathews, at last you felt
to do the right thing.

1893
01:56:44,630 --> 01:56:47,497
What do you want to drink?
Tea, coffee or..

1894
01:56:48,134 --> 01:56:48,930
Nothing.

1895
01:56:49,435 --> 01:56:52,768
lt's not enough that you have blocked
the arrest warrant against my father.

1896
01:56:52,972 --> 01:56:54,667
You should finish that case too.

1897
01:56:55,041 --> 01:56:58,841
Oh. You have come with
so many conditions, right?

1898
01:56:59,379 --> 01:57:02,177
That was a false case which you
have made for getting my land, right?

1899
01:57:02,715 --> 01:57:05,582
When you get that, you are responsible
to delete that case too.

1900
01:57:05,785 --> 01:57:07,946
Sir is able to delete any case.

1901
01:57:08,621 --> 01:57:12,853
Sir, you call Kaimal sir and put in a conference
call and speak to SFC MD Bashir sir.

1902
01:57:18,231 --> 01:57:19,027
Hello.

1903
01:57:24,737 --> 01:57:25,203
Okay.

1904
01:57:25,972 --> 01:57:28,964
Mathews, if you are ready
to sell your land to me..

1905
01:57:29,475 --> 01:57:32,137
Then today itself a paper will go
from SFC to collector's..

1906
01:57:32,345 --> 01:57:34,870
..office mentioning that you are ready
to wind up the case by the debt.

1907
01:57:35,081 --> 01:57:37,982
That Manager is little strict.

1908
01:57:38,184 --> 01:57:43,884
So, you have to pay Rs.50,000 after one week
for not giving her an opportunity to doubt.

1909
01:57:44,090 --> 01:57:46,149
After one month again you pay
Rs.50,000 more.

1910
01:57:46,359 --> 01:57:48,725
After that, this atmosphere will change.

1911
01:57:49,095 --> 01:57:52,656
Then they will give you one
non-liability certificate..

1912
01:57:52,865 --> 01:57:56,892
showing that you are not able to pay the loan
because your agriculture has been spoiled.

1913
01:57:57,103 --> 01:57:57,728
ls it enough?

1914
01:57:57,937 --> 01:57:59,404
These all are problem which
arise afterwards.

1915
01:57:59,772 --> 01:58:01,569
lf you won't do all this afterwards,
then what will we do.

1916
01:58:02,208 --> 01:58:03,732
Hey, l need his land only.

1917
01:58:03,943 --> 01:58:06,138
After getting that, l won't have
any enmity towards him.

1918
01:58:07,780 --> 01:58:09,304
l trust you.

1919
01:58:09,515 --> 01:58:11,813
Then you tell me,
how much you want per cent.

1920
01:58:13,186 --> 01:58:14,585
l haven't come here for money.

1921
01:58:14,954 --> 01:58:19,914
lf l take money from you, then l too
l will walk behind some one like you.

1922
01:58:20,460 --> 01:58:23,258
lt is not easy to get a land to start farm.

1923
01:58:23,796 --> 01:58:27,926
You take my land and give me another
land in which l could start my farm.

1924
01:58:28,134 --> 01:58:30,932
For starting a farm, now which property?

1925
01:58:32,972 --> 01:58:35,202
You have land near the
Vaipin bridge, right?

1926
01:58:35,408 --> 01:58:36,602
You give me that land.

1927
01:58:38,144 --> 01:58:40,612
How do you know that land is mine?

1928
01:58:40,813 --> 01:58:43,111
One of my friends had come
there to unload sand.

1929
01:58:43,316 --> 01:58:45,944
l have told Mathai about that land.
- Yes. l have seen that land.

1930
01:58:46,352 --> 01:58:49,287
lt is suited for starting a farm because
there is no people staying nearby.

1931
01:58:49,489 --> 01:58:52,185
Lake is nearby, and then there
is no problem for water.

1932
01:58:52,391 --> 01:58:54,450
Sand from the lake had been dumped
in that land, so it is good for agriculture.

1933
01:58:54,660 --> 01:58:56,958
lt is good. But..
- Sir.

1934
01:58:57,163 --> 01:58:58,130
Yes.
- Just a second.

1935
01:58:58,664 --> 01:58:59,631
One minute

1936
01:59:00,099 --> 01:59:00,793
What?

1937
01:59:03,336 --> 01:59:04,234
What is the matter?

1938
01:59:04,670 --> 01:59:08,128
Sir, if he came to know that it is deed-land,
then it would be a problem for you.

1939
01:59:08,341 --> 01:59:11,640
That land is not in my name.
Then what problem should l face?

1940
01:59:12,011 --> 01:59:14,206
We are writing the document
in his name.

1941
01:59:14,580 --> 01:59:16,980
lf he makes problem,
then he will be trapped.

1942
01:59:19,785 --> 01:59:21,753
The people in that place
are very cunning.

1943
01:59:22,121 --> 01:59:22,985
Even though the problem related
to the road is over..

1944
01:59:23,189 --> 01:59:24,986
..they will come again with some other
problem for taking money from me.

1945
01:59:25,691 --> 01:59:29,650
lf anyone comes to know that
the land is in fake names,

1946
01:59:29,862 --> 01:59:30,658
then that would also be a problem.

1947
01:59:30,863 --> 01:59:33,331
So, we should put that problem
in his head.

1948
01:59:33,533 --> 01:59:35,763
His land is three acres and
this is 2.5 acre.

1949
01:59:35,968 --> 01:59:38,334
lf we compare that too,
it is a profitable deal. You come.

1950
01:59:39,372 --> 01:59:43,331
Mathews, l will give you that land.
But a small problem is there.

1951
01:59:43,543 --> 01:59:46,671
That is a deed-land in the
name of 50 people.- Okay.

1952
01:59:47,280 --> 01:59:49,339
They all will write that land
in mine name, right?

1953
01:59:51,384 --> 01:59:54,512
That's enough.
But those 50 people are fake.

1954
01:59:54,720 --> 01:59:55,948
Then l don't want.
- That..

1955
01:59:56,155 --> 01:59:58,453
That is a suited land for starting farm.
But l don't want.

1956
01:59:58,658 --> 02:00:02,185
lf any problem arise, then l will lose
my land and l have to go to jail also.

1957
02:00:02,628 --> 02:00:06,359
l will get the documents of land ready
without any problem arising in future.

1958
02:00:07,233 --> 02:00:10,794
You can do all that.
Then too, l don't want.

1959
02:00:12,405 --> 02:00:16,273
A lot of people are living in the deed-land
by making fake documents.

1960
02:00:17,343 --> 02:00:18,867
But..
- Mathai. No.

1961
02:00:19,078 --> 02:00:19,806
At least it would be a problem.

1962
02:00:20,012 --> 02:00:23,470
We are always doing all these.
No problem will arise.

1963
02:00:24,917 --> 02:00:25,884
Sure.

1964
02:00:27,420 --> 02:00:28,978
One minute. l want to talk..

1965
02:00:31,190 --> 02:00:32,054
Who is that?

1966
02:00:51,244 --> 02:00:53,542
No problem will arise.
l am assuring you.

1967
02:00:53,746 --> 02:00:54,542
Okay.

1968
02:00:58,517 --> 02:01:01,042
l don't know anything about
this land dealing.

1969
02:01:01,921 --> 02:01:04,321
l have one relative.
Koshy who lives in Thevara.

1970
02:01:04,590 --> 02:01:07,058
He has good knowledge about all these.
He has called me now.

1971
02:01:07,560 --> 02:01:09,653
The document showing 50 people
are selling that land to me.

1972
02:01:09,962 --> 02:01:12,396
Then possession certificate.
The receipt of tax.

1973
02:01:12,932 --> 02:01:14,797
Then ownership certificate.

1974
02:01:15,101 --> 02:01:18,229
lf Koshy says everything is correct,
then l will buy.

1975
02:01:18,571 --> 02:01:21,836
Okay. l agreed.
What about your land?

1976
02:01:22,775 --> 02:01:25,505
After getting this ready,
l will give my land to you.

1977
02:01:26,679 --> 02:01:27,407
Today is 10th, right?
- Yes.

1978
02:01:27,613 --> 02:01:29,410
Let's write a MOU putting
the date 15th.

1979
02:01:29,882 --> 02:01:31,747
But you should add a clause
that this agreement is valid..

1980
02:01:31,951 --> 02:01:34,419
..only if you arrange a land for me.
- Okay.

1981
02:01:36,622 --> 02:01:37,589
One minute.

1982
02:01:38,958 --> 02:01:40,926
Kaimal sir. Reached?

1983
02:01:42,261 --> 02:01:44,092
Here, we have almost reached
an understanding.

1984
02:01:44,864 --> 02:01:50,996
What? Tourism minister?
ls it? That's good.

1985
02:01:51,704 --> 02:01:54,696
l will come there at night. Okay.

1986
02:01:56,075 --> 02:01:56,939
Hey, Jose.
- Yes.

1987
02:01:57,143 --> 02:01:59,270
Tourism minister has called Kaimal Sir.

1988
02:01:59,478 --> 02:02:03,278
Asia Vision is doing a programme
about our township.

1989
02:02:03,482 --> 02:02:06,280
They had gone to the minister's house
in Edakochi for taking a statement.

1990
02:02:06,819 --> 02:02:09,947
What have we spoken about now?
About putting one clause, right?

1991
02:02:10,156 --> 02:02:13,023
Yes, l will put. Hey, computer.
- Okay, Sir.

1992
02:02:16,162 --> 02:02:17,789
What about my father's arrest?

1993
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:22,297
l am with you.

1994
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:34,312
Kaimal Sir, you tell Bashir Sir to cancel the
arrest warrant against Mathew's father.

1995
02:02:34,513 --> 02:02:36,310
Here everything is okay.

1996
02:02:37,583 --> 02:02:38,311
Come

1997
02:02:42,021 --> 02:02:42,817
Give me.

1998
02:02:44,857 --> 02:02:45,323
Take.

1999
02:03:11,550 --> 02:03:13,677
Kodanad villagers are very happy.

2000
02:03:13,886 --> 02:03:16,946
They are happy because of their
dream about the..

2001
02:03:17,156 --> 02:03:18,453
..township is going to be fulfilled soon.

2002
02:03:18,958 --> 02:03:25,193
Chandi Joseph who lives in Aluva is the
master brain behind this township.

2003
02:03:25,898 --> 02:03:31,029
He is bringing a project of Rs.100 crore
as a part of township.

2004
02:03:31,570 --> 02:03:36,701
Now, l understood why political leaders
say that whatever comes in TV are lies.

2005
02:03:36,909 --> 02:03:37,807
Let's see the response
of our minister.

2006
02:03:38,811 --> 02:03:44,875
l have visited Kodanadu a lot of times.
A place of natural beauty.

2007
02:03:46,419 --> 02:03:49,547
When did he study all this?

2008
02:03:49,755 --> 02:03:51,723
Actually speaking we were planning about
the development of this place.

2009
02:03:52,324 --> 02:03:55,885
That time we came to know that
a township is coming there.

2010
02:03:56,429 --> 02:04:01,230
A lot of reputed companies has
shown interest in this project.

2011
02:04:07,940 --> 02:04:08,907
Whom you are calling now?

2012
02:04:11,243 --> 02:04:13,837
Hello, minister, Kaimal here.

2013
02:04:14,513 --> 02:04:18,074
l have called you to clear a doubt
while watching you on TV.

2014
02:04:18,684 --> 02:04:22,586
Minister, have you ever gone to
the village named Kodanad?

2015
02:04:22,788 --> 02:04:25,916
No. l have spoken what that
girl has taught me.

2016
02:04:26,125 --> 02:04:27,524
Anyway, it is good.

2017
02:04:27,726 --> 02:04:30,923
lt would be an added advantage
for your image that..

2018
02:04:31,130 --> 02:04:32,597
..you are also there behind
this auspicious matter.

2019
02:04:32,798 --> 02:04:33,924
ls it?
- Yes.

2020
02:04:34,133 --> 02:04:35,100
ls it?
- Yes.

2021
02:04:35,835 --> 02:04:36,927
l will call you later.

2022
02:04:38,237 --> 02:04:39,261
Over?

2023
02:04:41,307 --> 02:04:42,706
Sir, Ennachettiyar has called now.

2024
02:04:42,908 --> 02:04:44,273
He asked whether we are selling
the land in Kodanad.

2025
02:04:45,377 --> 02:04:46,867
Sir, how is things now?

2026
02:04:48,647 --> 02:04:51,616
lt happened like what l said.
More offers will come.

2027
02:04:51,984 --> 02:04:55,613
l will sell the land in Kodanadu for
double price which l expected.

2028
02:04:55,988 --> 02:04:59,617
Chandi is born in the land.
Land won't cheat Chandi.

2029
02:05:00,092 --> 02:05:01,787
l remembered when you
speak about land.

2030
02:05:01,994 --> 02:05:04,292
There are a lot of countries in this world.
l haven't seen.

2031
02:05:04,497 --> 02:05:07,466
After the problem related
to Mishra and flat get over,

2032
02:05:07,666 --> 02:05:12,035
l will...sent to the number one
tourist place in the world.

2033
02:05:12,838 --> 02:05:14,135
Hey, Jose.
- Yes.

2034
02:05:14,440 --> 02:05:17,136
Did you remind Bhuvnachandran
about tomorrow's documentation?

2035
02:05:17,343 --> 02:05:17,900
Yes. Yes.

2036
02:05:21,247 --> 02:05:23,181
There is no problem that it
took place in 2000.

2037
02:05:23,382 --> 02:05:26,010
The problem is that it took place
in the fifth month of the year.

2038
02:05:26,218 --> 02:05:28,345
Fifth month.
- Bhuvnan.

2039
02:05:28,554 --> 02:05:29,521
Yes.
- Did they reach?

2040
02:05:29,722 --> 02:05:31,849
Yes. There are checking the documents.

2041
02:05:32,057 --> 02:05:32,682
One minute.

2042
02:05:32,992 --> 02:05:36,359
You don't want this fifth month
here, right?- Yes.

2043
02:05:36,562 --> 02:05:38,928
You go and come tomorrow.
Rs.2000

2044
02:05:46,739 --> 02:05:47,535
Hey.
- Yes.

2045
02:05:47,907 --> 02:05:49,875
How is his relative who came with him?

2046
02:05:50,576 --> 02:05:54,034
A fool who believes that he
has good knowledge.

2047
02:05:55,347 --> 02:05:55,870
Come.

2048
02:06:16,702 --> 02:06:19,227
Koshy is saying that it is
a complicated dealing.

2049
02:06:21,273 --> 02:06:22,240
What do you do?

2050
02:06:22,441 --> 02:06:24,409
l had one electric shop.
Now it is closed.

2051
02:06:26,011 --> 02:06:27,638
What do you know about land dealing?

2052
02:06:28,213 --> 02:06:30,078
You don't take classes about
land dealing.

2053
02:06:30,883 --> 02:06:33,909
l have sold the entire property
of my family.

2054
02:06:34,119 --> 02:06:34,915
Oh.

2055
02:06:35,120 --> 02:06:37,588
Where is the document which shows
after how many years it can be sold?

2056
02:06:37,790 --> 02:06:40,918
That is in the register of land board.
There is no special title for that.

2057
02:06:41,126 --> 02:06:41,592
l have seen it.

2058
02:06:41,794 --> 02:06:43,421
There is no use that you have seen.
We also want to see that.

2059
02:06:44,296 --> 02:06:47,925
lf it is written in the register book
then lt can be sold after two years,

2060
02:06:48,133 --> 02:06:50,101
then you will go to jail.
- Koshy.

2061
02:06:51,136 --> 02:06:52,160
l want to see the register.

2062
02:06:52,538 --> 02:06:54,096
Then only l will agree for this dealing.

2063
02:06:54,473 --> 02:06:55,098
Take.

2064
02:07:02,481 --> 02:07:06,440
Kaimal Sir, ls there any chance
to get the register of our deed?

2065
02:07:07,820 --> 02:07:09,617
Register? For what?

2066
02:07:10,823 --> 02:07:14,623
A nuisance has come with him.
He wants to see that register.

2067
02:07:15,094 --> 02:07:17,119
Should l see that to him alone or
he wants to see that infront..

2068
02:07:17,329 --> 02:07:19,627
..of newspaper and
TV channel reporters?

2069
02:07:20,332 --> 02:07:23,301
l only know the difficulty of keeping
that register hiding.

2070
02:07:24,003 --> 02:07:25,630
lt is not possible to take that register.

2071
02:07:26,005 --> 02:07:28,371
Sir, this dealing would take place
only after getting that.

2072
02:07:28,607 --> 02:07:30,973
Sir, please.
- Do one thing.

2073
02:07:31,176 --> 02:07:33,144
Give the phone to that fool.
- Sir.

2074
02:07:34,913 --> 02:07:37,245
Revenue Secretary Divakara
Kaimal sir is in line.

2075
02:07:38,517 --> 02:07:39,142
Sir.
- Yes.

2076
02:07:39,351 --> 02:07:39,976
Take.

2077
02:07:41,687 --> 02:07:42,153
Hello, sir.

2078
02:07:42,354 --> 02:07:44,652
l haven't started this programme now.

2079
02:07:44,857 --> 02:07:48,156
Would anyone keep title for the land
which is going to sell?

2080
02:07:48,360 --> 02:07:49,156
Sir that..

2081
02:07:49,361 --> 02:07:51,420
Hey, the person who made
that deed is speaking.

2082
02:07:51,630 --> 02:07:53,154
lf you want, you believe this.

2083
02:07:53,532 --> 02:07:54,499
Hello, sir.

2084
02:07:54,800 --> 02:07:55,494
He has kept the phone.

2085
02:07:56,769 --> 02:07:59,761
We can believe a reputed
person like him, right?

2086
02:08:00,205 --> 02:08:02,673
That, we can believe.
- Okay.

2087
02:08:02,875 --> 02:08:03,842
But that is not enough.
- Then.

2088
02:08:04,943 --> 02:08:10,006
By making some fake address and photo
the documents won't be legal.

2089
02:08:10,215 --> 02:08:11,614
He is become a nuisance.

2090
02:08:13,052 --> 02:08:14,519
See the printing of this.

2091
02:08:14,720 --> 02:08:15,687
What is the problem?

2092
02:08:17,056 --> 02:08:19,854
This is like making notice for
the festival. No quality.

2093
02:08:20,059 --> 02:08:24,018
This is not printed anywhere else.
l myself printed in my press.

2094
02:08:24,229 --> 02:08:25,526
That's why it looks like this.

2095
02:08:26,398 --> 02:08:28,127
Nothing seems to have originality.

2096
02:08:29,068 --> 02:08:32,697
lf vigilance conducts some raid in
register office, then you will be trapped.

2097
02:08:32,905 --> 02:08:34,702
Oh Jesus. What will l do now.

2098
02:08:34,907 --> 02:08:38,866
You don't worry. One good document
writer is there, Kottapuram, Thankappan.

2099
02:08:39,078 --> 02:08:40,875
Expert. l will bring him here.
That is the only option.

2100
02:08:41,080 --> 02:08:41,546
Hey. Hey.

2101
02:08:41,747 --> 02:08:44,375
Koshy, don't say anything about
Bhuvnachandran's document.

2102
02:08:44,583 --> 02:08:47,984
The SFC's that paper you made
for Chandi to trap my father.

2103
02:08:48,187 --> 02:08:49,984
What work was that, right?
- Yes.

2104
02:08:50,489 --> 02:08:53,822
Even court couldn't find that the
documents which l made are fake.

2105
02:08:54,026 --> 02:08:54,651
You know that.

2106
02:08:54,860 --> 02:08:57,385
Then too, it doesn't have the perfection
of Kottapuram Thankappan's work.

2107
02:08:57,596 --> 02:09:01,054
You bring that Kottapuram
Thankappan here. l will teach him.

2108
02:09:01,266 --> 02:09:04,394
Look, one party of mine doesn't need
the 5th month in this document.

2109
02:09:04,603 --> 02:09:05,900
You come here.

2110
02:09:09,274 --> 02:09:10,070
Hey, what is this?

2111
02:09:10,776 --> 02:09:13,336
Are you rubbing the print with water?

2112
02:09:13,545 --> 02:09:14,068
l am not rubbing.

2113
02:09:14,279 --> 02:09:15,075
l am going to destroy that with
the help of termite.

2114
02:09:15,280 --> 02:09:16,907
After that l will keep this
in this anthill.

2115
02:09:17,116 --> 02:09:18,743
The termite will eat the part which is cold.

2116
02:09:18,951 --> 02:09:22,751
The famous document writers will
take at least one day for doing this.

2117
02:09:22,955 --> 02:09:26,584
These are very strong termites.
l need only hours for this.

2118
02:09:26,792 --> 02:09:27,759
Eat.

2119
02:10:07,833 --> 02:10:08,527
See this.

2120
02:10:11,003 --> 02:10:12,470
Now, almost, l understood.

2121
02:10:17,242 --> 02:10:21,645
Justice, the crime in the field of real estate
is very serious than that we expected.

2122
02:10:41,033 --> 02:10:43,160
This is the subject which needed
immediate action.

2123
02:10:43,869 --> 02:10:47,236
Prabalan, you should use all the
power of an amicus curiae.

2124
02:10:47,706 --> 02:10:50,903
You should bring this mafia in front
of the court without any loopholes.

2125
02:10:51,210 --> 02:10:52,108
Yes, Sir.

2126
02:10:58,617 --> 02:10:59,174
What happened, Sir?

2127
02:10:59,384 --> 02:11:01,852
Did judge understand everything?
- Yes.

2128
02:11:02,054 --> 02:11:05,353
That means they will go to jail.
Right sir?

2129
02:11:06,959 --> 02:11:08,187
But a small problem is there.

2130
02:11:08,493 --> 02:11:12,020
The king's rule of cutting the head
of criminal is over long back.

2131
02:11:12,631 --> 02:11:13,461
This is court.

2132
02:11:14,166 --> 02:11:17,192
Here case cross-examination
is there before punishing.

2133
02:11:17,603 --> 02:11:19,468
Sir, you are the amicus curiae
of this case.

2134
02:11:20,172 --> 02:11:24,040
Court believes you, that's why they
kept you as amicus curiae.

2135
02:11:24,243 --> 02:11:25,471
lf you say, won't the court listen?

2136
02:11:25,811 --> 02:11:27,870
What is there to cross examine
in this case?

2137
02:11:28,513 --> 02:11:31,107
What do you know about amicus curiae?

2138
02:11:31,416 --> 02:11:33,714
What do you know about article 226?

2139
02:11:33,919 --> 02:11:37,377
l don't know anything about article 226.
l am a poor farmer.

2140
02:11:37,923 --> 02:11:41,051
To save the agriculture from
spoiling in rain, we used to..

2141
02:11:41,260 --> 02:11:42,887
..flow water into the rain manhole.

2142
02:11:43,195 --> 02:11:45,220
When l asked Advocate Sunita
that is there any..

2143
02:11:45,430 --> 02:11:47,398
option to bring Chandi and group
like that in front of the court.

2144
02:11:48,166 --> 02:11:51,226
ln some famous cases where the
culprits gets the chance..

2145
02:11:51,503 --> 02:11:53,266
..to escape if handed over to police.

2146
02:11:53,505 --> 02:11:59,341
The court will appoint one amicus curiae
to handle the case.

2147
02:11:59,711 --> 02:12:03,374
Thus l have submitted the petition
through Advocate Sunita for that.

2148
02:12:10,122 --> 02:12:14,320
Putting a culprit to the jail is not as easy as
reaching rainwater in rain manhole.

2149
02:12:15,193 --> 02:12:17,354
amicus curiae means friend of court.

2150
02:12:17,562 --> 02:12:19,757
What l see is equivalent
to what court sees.

2151
02:12:20,299 --> 02:12:22,199
Case can be filed as per my report.

2152
02:12:22,401 --> 02:12:24,869
But the defendants can argue
by keeping good advocates.

2153
02:12:25,304 --> 02:12:27,272
They can even change the
division bench itself.

2154
02:12:27,472 --> 02:12:30,441
For the case to be strong there,
then proof is needed.

2155
02:12:31,743 --> 02:12:34,837
They should register that documents
in the register office.

2156
02:12:35,080 --> 02:12:37,605
Till that time we can't say
anything about this case.

2157
02:12:39,584 --> 02:12:42,781
lf it becomes flop, they can bring
up my father case again.

2158
02:12:43,822 --> 02:12:46,620
l have already signed the
agreement and if l won't..

2159
02:12:46,992 --> 02:12:49,290
give my land to him after buying his last,
then it would also be a headache.

2160
02:12:49,828 --> 02:12:50,726
Yes.

2161
02:12:52,931 --> 02:12:55,126
There are very brilliant.

2162
02:12:55,934 --> 02:13:01,304
Then too, we should register the document
before they come to know anything.

2163
02:13:02,274 --> 02:13:04,469
Will you come in village office
at 10am?

2164
02:13:04,676 --> 02:13:06,803
What for? For enjoying the wood work
of the empty chair?

2165
02:13:07,012 --> 02:13:09,139
No one will come in government
office at 10am.

2166
02:13:09,348 --> 02:13:10,474
l am having one speech
in the morning.

2167
02:13:10,682 --> 02:13:12,582
l will come there by 10.30 am.
- Sir.

2168
02:13:12,784 --> 02:13:14,649
What would happen if Chandi
or his people see you?

2169
02:13:14,853 --> 02:13:17,321
lf they heard my speech, then they
would have already improved.

2170
02:13:17,522 --> 02:13:18,750
Sir, you are an amicus curiae.

2171
02:13:18,957 --> 02:13:20,322
lf you go for speech and all..

2172
02:13:20,525 --> 02:13:22,425
l have become an amicus curiae
two days back.

2173
02:13:22,627 --> 02:13:24,822
l agreed for this speech
two weeks back.

2174
02:13:32,371 --> 02:13:34,999
People should fight against the
dead mafia who has..

2175
02:13:35,307 --> 02:13:38,606
..made the business of selling
dead body profitable.

2176
02:13:39,044 --> 02:13:41,512
l am reminding you that the
government should maintain..

2177
02:13:41,880 --> 02:13:47,011
..the account of the number of
dead bodies that are coming..

2178
02:13:47,452 --> 02:13:52,617
..to the medical college
for education purpose.

2179
02:13:52,991 --> 02:13:57,087
Reminding all this, l am briefing
my speech. Thank you. Good bye.

2180
02:13:59,564 --> 02:14:00,531
May l go?
- Okay.

2181
02:14:02,901 --> 02:14:04,198
l was supposed to say
something more.- Okay.

2182
02:14:04,403 --> 02:14:06,633
But l have briefed the speech for you.
How was my speech?

2183
02:14:06,838 --> 02:14:09,204
l haven't listened to your speech
properly because l was..

2184
02:14:09,408 --> 02:14:10,705
..seeing whether Chandi or
his people were coming.

2185
02:14:11,076 --> 02:14:12,976
Sir, don't feel bad for
what l am asking.

2186
02:14:13,345 --> 02:14:17,042
No one has given attention
to your speech.

2187
02:14:17,249 --> 02:14:19,649
For getting people's attention,
l have to conduct cabaret.

2188
02:14:21,586 --> 02:14:22,052
That..

2189
02:14:23,588 --> 02:14:26,716
l am giving speech for getting
the clap of people.

2190
02:14:27,025 --> 02:14:29,994
l want to say loudly
what is there on my mind.

2191
02:14:30,595 --> 02:14:34,827
Any one person who is going
should listen to at least one..

2192
02:14:35,033 --> 02:14:39,800
..sentence of my speech,
then it is my success.

2193
02:14:41,940 --> 02:14:43,908
You have listened to my speech
for at least one moment, right?

2194
02:14:44,109 --> 02:14:45,076
That is my success.

2195
02:14:50,115 --> 02:14:52,140
l will tell you something if you
won't get too proud.- Okay.

2196
02:14:53,285 --> 02:14:55,014
The decrease in the production
is one of the main..

2197
02:14:55,220 --> 02:14:58,087
..reason for the fall of
a country like America.

2198
02:14:58,623 --> 02:15:00,420
We are also going through
the same path.

2199
02:15:00,892 --> 02:15:02,257
The agricultural lands are vanished.

2200
02:15:02,861 --> 02:15:08,265
Asian agreement will become
a threat for us because of the..

2201
02:15:08,467 --> 02:15:10,594
rule here and also because of the
agricultural field that has become weak.

2202
02:15:11,069 --> 02:15:13,367
l have given speech about
this topic in a lot of places.

2203
02:15:13,572 --> 02:15:15,096
No one has given attention
to my speech.

2204
02:15:15,807 --> 02:15:18,105
lf you succeed in this one man fight..

2205
02:15:19,144 --> 02:15:22,272
Then the people will come to know
about my speeches within one day.

2206
02:15:22,647 --> 02:15:24,774
That would be the success
of people like me.

2207
02:15:25,150 --> 02:15:26,708
Success of the state.

2208
02:15:30,288 --> 02:15:31,448
''VlLLAGE OFFlCE''

2209
02:15:31,890 --> 02:15:34,620
Come after one week.
- My son's interview.

2210
02:15:34,826 --> 02:15:36,350
How can l give caste
certificate like that?

2211
02:15:36,561 --> 02:15:39,792
Let us study about that.
You please sit.- Okay.

2212
02:15:43,335 --> 02:15:45,633
These people are going
to buy the land.

2213
02:15:47,672 --> 02:15:48,866
Sir, is it ready?

2214
02:15:49,341 --> 02:15:49,966
Venu.
- Yes.

2215
02:15:50,175 --> 02:15:51,142
Bring fast.
- Okay, sir.

2216
02:15:51,343 --> 02:15:55,211
l have got ready the location sketch,
possession certificate etc.

2217
02:15:55,514 --> 02:15:57,141
You will get the receipt
of tax remission now.

2218
02:15:57,682 --> 02:16:03,143
Sir, you also know that this land
is in fake name, right?- Yes.

2219
02:16:05,357 --> 02:16:09,316
ls there any problem in that?
- What problem?

2220
02:16:09,594 --> 02:16:12,927
We have even made
documents of dead people.

2221
02:16:18,670 --> 02:16:20,661
l have seen you somewhere.

2222
02:16:21,206 --> 02:16:23,003
Related to some case.

2223
02:16:23,208 --> 02:16:30,842
Yes. l had come here related to a
case of my family property.- Okay.

2224
02:16:33,485 --> 02:16:36,682
No. Not here.
Somewhere else.

2225
02:16:37,022 --> 02:16:40,924
l have seen you but l can't
remember that clearly.

2226
02:16:42,727 --> 02:16:44,957
Yes, we have met outside.

2227
02:16:45,730 --> 02:16:48,631
For correcting the non-liability
certificate of my property.

2228
02:16:49,234 --> 02:16:50,030
For giving money.

2229
02:16:50,902 --> 02:16:53,871
That day, when we were in
the bar, you were fit.

2230
02:16:54,639 --> 02:16:56,539
That's why you haven't
remembered that clearly.

2231
02:16:56,741 --> 02:16:57,537
Oh. That's why.

2232
02:17:00,579 --> 02:17:02,046
How much is the payment for tax?

2233
02:17:02,414 --> 02:17:04,143
Rs.4,200.

2234
02:17:05,750 --> 02:17:07,377
Take. Take this.

2235
02:17:08,620 --> 02:17:11,384
Construction of my house is going on.
l will disturb you again.

2236
02:17:13,758 --> 02:17:16,056
This is for our people.
- Okay.

2237
02:17:16,261 --> 02:17:18,229
Shall we leave?
- Yes.

2238
02:17:18,430 --> 02:17:19,158
Okay.

2239
02:17:21,333 --> 02:17:22,231
ln the bar.

2240
02:17:26,171 --> 02:17:27,638
We are going to the register
office directly, right?

2241
02:17:27,872 --> 02:17:28,998
l have bribed the register.

2242
02:17:29,207 --> 02:17:31,641
He will come directly to
Revathy hotel.- That..

2243
02:17:31,843 --> 02:17:35,301
How will we go to the register office
without 50 land owners?

2244
02:17:35,680 --> 02:17:37,739
Some holy people are there.
They will block the registration.

2245
02:17:37,949 --> 02:17:41,578
Yes. Yes. lt is valid if the registrar
comes here to register.

2246
02:17:41,953 --> 02:17:43,181
Then no problem.

2247
02:17:43,622 --> 02:17:45,419
l have already told you that
l need Cl Prabhakaran and..

2248
02:17:45,624 --> 02:17:49,583
..Yesudas Sir for attestation
and witness.

2249
02:17:50,629 --> 02:17:52,256
You don't worry.

2250
02:17:52,464 --> 02:17:53,988
l am not doing this for the first time.

2251
02:17:54,232 --> 02:17:55,756
Where have these people come from?

2252
02:18:05,310 --> 02:18:05,935
Sir.

2253
02:18:12,083 --> 02:18:13,209
Haven't you gone to court today?

2254
02:18:13,652 --> 02:18:15,279
My case is to be held tomorrow.

2255
02:18:15,487 --> 02:18:16,784
l came to the village..

2256
02:18:17,822 --> 02:18:19,289
No. No. Don't come out.

2257
02:18:19,491 --> 02:18:22,119
l am having one registration.
l am busy.- Okay.

2258
02:18:42,347 --> 02:18:44,474
Some problem is there somewhere.

2259
02:18:44,683 --> 02:18:45,650
You take the vehicle.

2260
02:18:55,193 --> 02:18:58,651
Hello. ls it Revathy hotel?
l am Chandi here.

2261

02:19:02,634 --> 02:19:04,158
No. Don't connect to the room.

You know Thevara very well, right?

2269
02:19:42,474 --> 02:19:45,375
What question is that?
l have failed in Panchayat election there.

2270
02:19:45,677 --> 02:19:47,372
Do you know one Koshy there?

2271
02:19:47,912 --> 02:19:49,539
The one who has become a debtor
after running an electric shop?

2272
02:19:49,748 --> 02:19:51,375
lf you ask me like this,
it is difficult to say.

2273
02:19:52,016 --> 02:19:53,881
My people are there.
They might know him.

2274
02:19:54,252 --> 02:19:57,221
You go there and enquire about him.

2275
02:19:57,589 --> 02:20:00,717
Then you go to his house
and enquire about him.

2276
02:20:00,925 --> 02:20:02,893
What for?
- You just enquire.

2277
02:20:03,361 --> 02:20:05,056
Then you call me.

Come. Come.

2281
02:20:34,058 --> 02:20:37,084
Did the registrar come?
- He will come.

2282
02:20:38,296 --> 02:20:40,526
Koshy. Please come.

2283
02:20:51,142 --> 02:20:51,608
Come.

2284
02:21:05,990 --> 02:21:06,786

2285
02:21:07,759 --> 02:21:10,626
Nothing. l have just looked at you.

2286
02:21:12,497 --> 02:21:12,963
Come.

2287
02:21:54,372 --> 02:21:55,168
Come inside.

2288
02:22:01,713 --> 02:22:02,509
Registrar.

2289
02:22:03,615 --> 02:22:04,343
He will come now.

2290
02:22:04,549 --> 02:22:06,676
Till that time let's speak something.

2291
02:22:10,388 --> 02:22:12,185
What happened?
Why are you both upset?

2292
02:22:12,390 --> 02:22:16,690
Shall l order something hot? lt is better
to open the mind.- No thanks.

2293
02:22:17,161 --> 02:22:18,685
At least beer.
- No thanks. l won't drink.

2294
02:22:18,897 --> 02:22:20,125
Then l will drink.

2295

Chandi here.
My permanent brand. Three.

2296
02:22:29,407 --> 02:22:32,706
lf you drink and sit and
if registrar comes..

2297
02:22:33,511 --> 02:22:35,638
Let him come.
You sit.

2298
02:22:45,256 --> 02:22:48,714
What you are saying?
- What?

2299
02:22:49,093 --> 02:22:50,890
Nothing. l just asked.

2300
02:22:51,095 --> 02:22:54,553
l am a person who lives properly
by doing all these false deals.

2301
02:22:55,433 --> 02:23:00,063
People who are dealing with me
would also be like that.

2302
02:23:00,939 --> 02:23:02,736
Jose, what is the name of
that man in lrumbanam?

2303
02:23:02,941 --> 02:23:05,239
Sreekumar.
- lrumbanam Sreekumar.

2304
02:23:05,877 --> 02:23:08,744
l have shot with this in his mouth
on the day when..

2305
02:23:08,947 --> 02:23:11,643
..he sold a problematic land to me.

2306
02:23:12,016 --> 02:23:15,179
After that, l have never used this.

2307
02:23:18,356 --> 02:23:19,687
Hey, open the door.
- Okay.

2308
02:23:35,740 --> 02:23:38,106
Hey, lock the room.
- Yes Sir.

2309
02:23:43,247 --> 02:23:46,216
You want to say something.
- No.

2310
02:23:47,719 --> 02:23:52,281
Where is the registrar?
- He will come now.

2311
02:23:59,931 --> 02:24:02,559
You know why l am doing
registration here?

2312
02:24:02,800 --> 02:24:04,700
This is like my own hotel.

2313
02:24:05,169 --> 02:24:08,070
Whatever happens inside this,
no one will come to know.

2314
02:24:17,782 --> 02:24:20,307
Ennachettiyar. For land.
- Tell him l m not here.

2315
02:24:20,518 --> 02:24:22,577
Let me finish these people's dealing.

2316
02:24:26,357 --> 02:24:28,325
He will come. Registrar.

2317
02:24:32,363 --> 02:24:34,422
This is the house of Koshy
who ran electric shop.

2318
02:24:35,299 --> 02:24:36,926
lf he is not here, then he would
be in Aswathy bar.

2319
02:24:37,268 --> 02:24:38,326
He is a drunkard.

2320
02:24:51,716 --> 02:24:52,842
l am Shibu Aruvikutty.

2321
02:24:53,051 --> 02:24:53,949
l had contested in the election here.

2322
02:24:54,152 --> 02:24:55,346
ls Koshy here?
- No.

2323
02:24:55,553 --> 02:24:56,679
Where he is gone?
- What happened?

2324
02:24:56,988 --> 02:24:57,955
l want to tell him something.

2325
02:24:58,156 --> 02:25:01,353
He has gone with a relative
regarding some land dealing.

2326
02:25:01,559 --> 02:25:02,856
Okay then.
- Okay.

2327
02:25:06,898 --> 02:25:08,365
ls there any problem, daughter?

2328
02:25:09,333 --> 02:25:13,133
l have given Koshy uncle's name and address
for a court matter related to Mathews.

2329
02:25:14,338 --> 02:25:16,863
lf some problem arises,
then court will give you protection.

2330
02:25:17,175 --> 02:25:21,043
l can't sit here in the house
for entire day.

2331
02:25:29,921 --> 02:25:30,717
lt is Shibu.

2332
02:25:39,764 --> 02:25:42,232
Oh. Okay.

2333
02:25:45,770 --> 02:25:47,067
You have said lie to me, right?

2334
02:25:48,873 --> 02:25:49,999
You won't drink.

2335
02:25:51,943 --> 02:25:52,671
Come. Come.

2336
02:25:53,945 --> 02:25:54,912
There have come.

2337
02:26:01,619 --> 02:26:03,246
This is Koshy. This is Mathews.

2338
02:26:03,454 --> 02:26:04,421
Sir you come.

2339
02:26:06,791 --> 02:26:07,587
Sit.

2340
02:26:11,629 --> 02:26:12,596
You too sit.

2341
02:26:14,132 --> 02:26:14,928
Jose.

2342
02:26:26,811 --> 02:26:30,872
ls he attesting the lD without
seeing the people?

2343
02:26:31,082 --> 02:26:32,879
He is a person who takes action
without seeing the face.

2344
02:26:41,826 --> 02:26:42,292
Take.

2345
02:26:43,327 --> 02:26:43,793
Here.

2346
02:26:47,231 --> 02:26:48,289
Just a second.

2347
02:26:51,235 --> 02:26:51,963
lt is Shibu.

2348
02:26:56,007 --> 02:26:56,632
Hello.

2349
02:27:07,585 --> 02:27:08,574
Fool.

2350
02:27:12,456 --> 02:27:14,321
He is asking for the money.

2351
02:27:14,525 --> 02:27:17,494
l have to give donation for party fund.

2352
02:27:19,096 --> 02:27:19,824
Start.

2353
02:27:26,704 --> 02:27:27,830
Where are the 50 sellers?

2354
02:27:28,873 --> 02:27:29,840
They will come.

2355
02:27:35,479 --> 02:27:36,503
Bhuvnan.
- Yes.

2356
02:28:04,742 --> 02:28:05,208
Take.

2357
02:28:17,321 --> 02:28:18,219
Let's start.

2358
02:28:47,618 --> 02:28:48,585
One more is needed.

2359
02:28:59,297 --> 02:28:59,922
Take.

2360
02:29:02,800 --> 02:29:04,028
Are you going soon?

2361
02:29:09,407 --> 02:29:14,401
l have done the work within 1 day,
which should be finished in three days,

2362
02:29:14,478 --> 02:29:18,812
for registering your land tomorrow itself.
Are you okay?

2363
02:29:20,584 --> 02:29:21,448
Yes okay.

2364
02:29:22,820 --> 02:29:25,288
You are great.

2365
02:29:28,759 --> 02:29:29,555
You too.

2366
02:29:33,097 --> 02:29:35,463
Then too, you have cheated you.

2367
02:29:38,102 --> 02:29:41,128
You told me lie that you don't drink.

2368
02:29:44,342 --> 02:29:45,366
Go. Go.

2369
02:30:01,359 --> 02:30:03,657
Hello. Yes.

2370
02:30:07,531 --> 02:30:08,156
ls it?

2371
02:30:11,635 --> 02:30:12,329
Tell me.

2372
02:30:13,137 --> 02:30:14,161
ls it?

2373
02:30:15,206 --> 02:30:15,672
Okay.

2374
02:30:21,312 --> 02:30:22,336
Hello Chandi Sir.

2375
02:30:34,558 --> 02:30:35,525
Why did you call me?

2376
02:30:36,727 --> 02:30:38,524
Fool.
- Chandi.

2377
02:30:40,431 --> 02:30:42,729
You spied me to the court.

2378
02:30:43,034 --> 02:30:44,228
Chandi, what is this?

2379
02:30:44,769 --> 02:30:46,236
You called me here for speaking
about land.

2380
02:30:46,871 --> 02:30:49,135
Jose, what happened to Chandi?

2381
02:30:49,340 --> 02:30:52,173
Hey, if you act in front of me,
l will shoot you.

2382
02:30:52,843 --> 02:30:54,902
First, you ask him whether it is true.

2383
02:30:55,112 --> 02:30:56,511
Kill afterwards.

2384
02:30:58,949 --> 02:31:01,747
Did you come with... from court?
What is that?

2385
02:31:01,952 --> 02:31:02,919
Amicus curiae.

2386
02:31:03,120 --> 02:31:05,350
You have come for land dealing
with that, right?

2387
02:31:05,956 --> 02:31:07,753
l have heard about something else.

2388
02:31:07,958 --> 02:31:09,425
What is this?
- Amicus curiae

2389
02:31:09,627 --> 02:31:10,924
l don't know what that is.

2390
02:31:11,128 --> 02:31:12,527
You don't try to escape by
saying like that.

2391
02:31:12,730 --> 02:31:14,527
The person who came with you
was Advocate Prabalan.

2392
02:31:14,732 --> 02:31:18,930
Advocate Manoharan has informed me
that he is amicus curiae.

2393
02:31:21,305 --> 02:31:22,431
l will tell you the truth.

2394
02:31:22,640 --> 02:31:24,767
The person who came with me
was Advocate Prabalan. That's true.

2395
02:31:25,709 --> 02:31:26,767
Let me tell.

2396
02:31:27,144 --> 02:31:30,272
When l decided to buy your land,
he came to see me.

2397
02:31:30,481 --> 02:31:34,440
He said me that he would accompany me.
Otherwise you would cheat me.

2398
02:31:34,652 --> 02:31:36,119
He only told me to say
he was my relative.

2399
02:31:36,320 --> 02:31:38,288
l thought that a person who knows
laws should be there with me.

2400
02:31:38,489 --> 02:31:40,047
l don't know anything about
what you said. What is that?

2401
02:31:40,558 --> 02:31:42,219
Amicus curiae.
- l don't know anything.

2402
02:31:42,460 --> 02:31:47,124
Without your knowledge, from court..
Oh. That name. What was that?

2403
02:31:47,331 --> 02:31:48,389
That itself.
- Yes.

2404
02:31:48,833 --> 02:31:54,738
Chandi. But court can appoint amicus curiae
on the basis of public's appeal.

2405
02:31:55,005 --> 02:31:57,132
lt is Advocate Prabalan, so we can
suspect in that way also.

2406
02:31:57,341 --> 02:32:01,300
He used to do all this.
- Will it become a case?

2407
02:32:01,512 --> 02:32:01,978
You fool.

2408
02:32:02,179 --> 02:32:03,578
lf l knew all this, would l join him?

2409
02:32:04,181 --> 02:32:05,375
lf it becomes case,
then l will be trapped.

2410
02:32:05,683 --> 02:32:06,650
Chandi, you will be trapped.

2411
02:32:07,184 --> 02:32:09,482
Even Jose will also get trapped.
- Me?

2412
02:32:15,359 --> 02:32:16,326
You too will be trapped.

2413
02:32:22,366 --> 02:32:22,832
What happened?

2414
02:32:23,033 --> 02:32:24,159
We have found Advocate Prabalan's house.

2415
02:32:24,368 --> 02:32:25,995
But he has escaped with his family.

2416
02:32:26,203 --> 02:32:28,171
Even neighbours won't know
where he has gone.

2417
02:32:28,372 --> 02:32:31,739
Oh. Came to inform that.
What a responsibility?

2418
02:32:31,942 --> 02:32:36,345
Go and search him in his
relatives and friends house.

2419
02:32:36,547 --> 02:32:37,673
You come back here with him.
- Okay sir.

2420
02:32:37,882 --> 02:32:38,678
Then go.

2421
02:32:39,817 --> 02:32:42,183
lf that report reaches the court
tomorrow, then it would be a big problem.

2422
02:32:42,386 --> 02:32:44,854
Amicus curiae comes under
the extraordinary jurisdiction.

2423
02:32:45,055 --> 02:32:45,953
Judge can do anything.

2424
02:32:46,157 --> 02:32:47,624
He can issue note through
the messenger.

2425
02:32:47,825 --> 02:32:50,123
Police can call to the court
and even arrest us also.

2426
02:32:50,394 --> 02:32:51,691
lt's true.
Look, the phone is ringing.

2427
02:32:52,062 --> 02:32:55,031
Oh, tomorrow Advocate Prabalan will
become famous because of this case.

2428
02:32:55,399 --> 02:32:56,696
Let me drink one peg.

2429
02:32:58,736 --> 02:32:59,464
This is Mishra.

2430
02:32:59,670 --> 02:33:03,197
He is calling now to ask me about
tomorrow's registration. Fed up of him.

2431
02:33:04,909 --> 02:33:07,969
Chandi. l can't drink like this.

2432
02:33:08,179 --> 02:33:10,807
l am having ulcer.

2433
02:33:11,015 --> 02:33:11,538
You.

2434
02:33:13,651 --> 02:33:15,881
Jose. Now he has to take
care of his health.

2435
02:33:16,253 --> 02:33:18,619
Sir is only here to save us.
You go and buy chicken fry for him.

2436
02:33:20,257 --> 02:33:24,318
Chandi, no need of getting tensed like this.
You call others also.

2437
02:33:24,528 --> 02:33:27,395
Let's discuss and find a solution
for this matter together.

2438
02:33:27,932 --> 02:33:30,901
Right?
- Yes.

2439
02:33:33,170 --> 02:33:35,229
Hello.
- lt's true.

2440
02:33:35,439 --> 02:33:38,067
lf that report reaches the court,
then all of us will go to jail.

2441
02:33:40,010 --> 02:33:41,568
You are the only reason behind all this.

2442
02:33:41,779 --> 02:33:43,576
Why didn't you tell us that
he is an advocate?

2443
02:33:43,781 --> 02:33:45,908
l didn't know that.

2444
02:33:46,884 --> 02:33:50,411
lf l was not there then too, he will
trap you with the order of court.

2445
02:33:51,222 --> 02:33:53,349
Now, l have become the first defendant.

2446
02:33:53,557 --> 02:33:55,525
Otherwise Chandi would
become the first defendant.

2447
02:33:56,126 --> 02:33:59,755
l have even told him that even
court can't find that the..

2448
02:33:59,964 --> 02:34:00,760
..documents which l make are fake.

2449
02:34:00,965 --> 02:34:02,592
How will l look at the face ofjudge?

2450
02:34:02,800 --> 02:34:04,529
Why do you want to look atjudge's face?

2451
02:34:04,735 --> 02:34:05,759
That's also right.

2452
02:34:07,905 --> 02:34:11,272
l was to open a finance company
in my wife's name tomorrow.

2453
02:34:12,142 --> 02:34:13,200
But everything is gone.

2454
02:34:13,410 --> 02:34:16,277
You don't get tensed.
Everything has a solution.

2455
02:34:18,983 --> 02:34:22,214
Chandi. Chandi. Come here.

2456
02:34:24,822 --> 02:34:30,783
Hey. Let's destroy the register book
in which the registration is done.

2457
02:34:31,061 --> 02:34:32,050
That's not possible.

2458
02:34:32,663 --> 02:34:33,960
There is serial number for all books.

2459
02:34:34,665 --> 02:34:36,963
Oh.- Come here. Come here.

2460
02:34:38,335 --> 02:34:42,635
Section 201 .
Destroying the proof of the crime.

2461
02:34:42,940 --> 02:34:44,805
Then the problem will become
more complicated.

2462
02:34:45,342 --> 02:34:46,969
Chicken fry has not come yet.

2463
02:34:47,945 --> 02:34:51,813
ls it possible that all of us
leave this place and go?

2464
02:34:52,616 --> 02:34:57,485
82 CRPC. 83 CRPC.
This two are sure.

2465
02:34:57,688 --> 02:35:00,316
Tomorrow onwards your pictures
would come in newspapers.

2466
02:35:00,524 --> 02:35:02,992
After few days,
police would arrest you.

2467
02:35:03,193 --> 02:35:03,818
Oh!

2468
02:35:07,364 --> 02:35:08,592
Police came?

2469
02:35:17,875 --> 02:35:20,605
You have scared me by putting this siren.

2470
02:35:20,811 --> 02:35:23,837
l don't think that l can travel in
front seat of the police jeep.

2471
02:35:24,048 --> 02:35:26,016
l have celebrated the last travel.

2472
02:35:26,216 --> 02:35:27,274
Oh! He.

2473
02:35:27,885 --> 02:35:31,184
l have just attested this lD cards.

2474
02:35:32,222 --> 02:35:35,191
Section 34. Section 120 B.

2475
02:35:35,392 --> 02:35:39,021
Small role in the crime is also
equivalent to the crime.

2476
02:35:39,229 --> 02:35:42,096
lnvolved in conspiracy is
also a criminal offence.

2477
02:35:42,299 --> 02:35:44,859
That too misusing the official power.

2478
02:35:45,235 --> 02:35:47,703
Without knowing all these
what police you are.

2479
02:35:48,005 --> 02:35:51,133
Are you drinking like this after saying
about the offences and punishment.

2480
02:35:52,076 --> 02:35:55,102
Chandi, there is nothing to
get tensed in this.

2481
02:35:55,312 --> 02:36:00,716
460, 420, 120 A lot of sections
are involved in this case.

2482
02:36:01,251 --> 02:36:03,219
Everyone will go inside.
That's sure.

2483
02:36:04,755 --> 02:36:10,057
Then including that flat's case,
Chandi's matter is almost finished.

2484
02:36:10,594 --> 02:36:18,467
Besides this, Chandi had told amicus curiae
about the murder of Erumbanam Sreekumar.

2485
02:36:19,103 --> 02:36:23,233
Oh. You told him that too?
Section 302 lPC.

2486
02:36:23,607 --> 02:36:26,007
That too, brutal and
cold blooded murder.

2487
02:36:28,112 --> 02:36:31,138
l have to sweat a lot to save you
from death sentencing.

2488
02:36:32,182 --> 02:36:32,978
Move aside.

2489
02:36:34,118 --> 02:36:35,915
Has chicken fry come?
- l don't know.

2490
02:36:40,791 --> 02:36:41,689
Chandi.
- Yes.

2491
02:36:41,892 --> 02:36:44,326
Let's close this case at any cost.

2492
02:36:44,728 --> 02:36:49,256
One other option is there.
Let's bribe the judge.

2493
02:36:52,636 --> 02:36:55,764
lf you want, l'll make some recommendation
letter of Supreme Courtjudge.

2494
02:36:55,973 --> 02:36:57,201
l need only one sample signature.

2495
02:36:57,408 --> 02:37:00,605
Now, we are suffering because
of your fake documents.

2496
02:37:00,944 --> 02:37:01,933
Please don't make it more complicated.

2497
02:37:02,146 --> 02:37:02,840
Chandi.
- Yes.

2498
02:37:03,080 --> 02:37:07,449
You have a lot of friends, right?
Let's use all that for this purpose.

2499
02:37:15,659 --> 02:37:19,288
ls it Mishra?
- No. Ennachettiyar. For land dealing.

2500
02:37:34,778 --> 02:37:38,305
Hello. He is having high BP.
We can't hand over the phone to him.

2501
02:37:39,016 --> 02:37:40,643
Who is that?
- One Mr. Chandi.

2502
02:37:40,851 --> 02:37:41,476

2503
02:37:44,121 --> 02:37:45,145
lt's me.

2504
02:37:45,522 --> 02:37:49,822
When you told me that you will send
me to the number one tourist..

2505
02:37:50,027 --> 02:37:51,892
place in the world,
l didn't expect this much.

2506
02:37:53,964 --> 02:37:56,330
That day in the police station you
had handed over phone..

2507
02:37:56,533 --> 02:37:58,000
..to him saying SP and DYSP, right?
- Yes.

2508
02:37:58,202 --> 02:37:59,430
Now, you call them.

2509
02:38:01,972 --> 02:38:02,996
SP.
- Okay.

2510
02:38:05,709 --> 02:38:08,906
Hello, sir. Chandi here.
l am fine here.

2511
02:38:09,213 --> 02:38:11,010
But in between a small problem.

2512
02:38:11,215 --> 02:38:15,345
From the court one..
- Amicus curiae.

2513
02:38:15,886 --> 02:38:18,013
Amicus curiae.
- Yes. Yes.

2514
02:38:18,322 --> 02:38:21,348
Sir, amicus curiae has come and
collected evidence against me.

2515
02:38:21,558 --> 02:38:22,183
That..

2516
02:38:22,392 --> 02:38:25,919
Hello. Hello. He has cut the phone.
- You try the phone.

2517
02:38:26,897 --> 02:38:30,856
The subscriber you are calling
is switched off.- Switched off.

2518
02:38:31,068 --> 02:38:33,969
SP has switched off the phone.
Now you call DYSP. Call DYSP.

2519
02:38:34,171 --> 02:38:36,036
We don't know who is going
to help us. Call. Call.

2520
02:38:36,406 --> 02:38:39,034
DYSP's new phone number
is with Jose. Jose.

2521
02:38:39,343 --> 02:38:41,709
Jose who has gone to buy chicken
fry has not come back yet.

2522
02:38:45,249 --> 02:38:46,375
He is out of range.

2523
02:38:47,918 --> 02:38:51,217
Jose has also escaped.
- No problem, Chandi. Police will catch him.

2524
02:38:55,592 --> 02:38:58,220
The people who have gone in search
of Advocate Prabalan have not come back.

2525
02:38:58,428 --> 02:39:00,726
They must have also escaped.
Sure.

2526
02:39:10,941 --> 02:39:12,738
What will we do now?

2527
02:39:17,414 --> 02:39:18,073
Advocate.

2528
02:39:18,882 --> 02:39:21,851
Amicus curiae.
l won't repeat again.

2529
02:39:24,821 --> 02:39:26,083
Now, only one option is there.

2530
02:39:33,764 --> 02:39:36,028
This all happened because of me, right?

2531
02:39:36,266 --> 02:39:41,533
When the case comes in the court,
l will take the maximum blame.

2532
02:39:53,650 --> 02:39:56,448
Son. Mathews.

2533
02:39:57,187 --> 02:39:58,620
''CHlEF JUDlClAL MAGlSTRATE COURT''

2534
02:40:10,334 --> 02:40:12,700
So these are the persons
mentioned in your report.

2535
02:40:12,903 --> 02:40:13,801
Yes, Your Honour.

2536
02:40:17,274 --> 02:40:19,469
Mathews is also a defendant, right?

2537
02:40:20,677 --> 02:40:24,636
After accepting amicus curiae's
report the honourable High court

2538
02:40:24,848 --> 02:40:27,976
directed the police to register
crime and proceed..

2539
02:40:28,185 --> 02:40:29,914
..against this land grabbers.

2540
02:40:30,487 --> 02:40:34,150
They are remanded to judicial
custody for 14 days.

2541
02:40:44,368 --> 02:40:48,668
The court is congratulating the
farmer Mathews who has..

2542
02:40:48,872 --> 02:40:52,330
..bring this land mafia in front
of the court for saving..

2543
02:40:52,542 --> 02:40:55,272
..own agricultural land,
using his intelligence.

2544
02:41:04,388 --> 02:41:05,616
Walk.

2545
02:41:14,131 --> 02:41:14,790
Advocate.

2546
02:41:14,998 --> 02:41:18,934
l have called you in the name of
Advocate Manoharan of High Court.

2547
02:41:19,336 --> 02:41:22,772
l had hided Prabalan Sir
and family from their house.

2548
02:41:24,174 --> 02:41:25,698
l used to destroy insects
which come to damage..

2549
02:41:25,909 --> 02:41:28,707
..agriculture using garlic
water and tobacco syrup.

2550
02:41:28,912 --> 02:41:30,539
l had told you this when
you came to acquire my land.

2551
02:41:30,747 --> 02:41:32,374
That time Chandi didn't
understand that.

2552
02:41:32,683 --> 02:41:37,382
At the night what happened in
your house is also the same.

2553
02:41:37,688 --> 02:41:41,454
l have made you to experience
what l and my family has suffered.

2554
02:41:41,758 --> 02:41:43,658
Without that l was not satisfied
to send you to the jail.

2555
02:41:43,860 --> 02:41:44,986
Chandi Sir, you go.

2556
02:41:50,600 --> 02:41:51,396
Thank you.

2557
02:41:52,869 --> 02:41:55,337
Congratulation.
- Congratulation.

2558
02:42:06,083 --> 02:42:09,519
Sir, if you promoted Chandi's
township for the people.

2559
02:42:09,853 --> 02:42:11,252
Then why can't the government
undertake that?

2560
02:42:11,555 --> 02:42:16,015
Sir, you've told that the process of declaring
Kodanad as tourist village is going on.

2561
02:42:16,226 --> 02:42:18,694
Yes. l haven't said that for
the sake of time.

2562
02:42:19,296 --> 02:42:22,424
The revenue minister has ordered
to recover the properties of Chandi.

2563
02:42:23,300 --> 02:42:25,700
This government doesn't have
any connection with land mafia.

2564
02:42:26,470 --> 02:42:28,768
The prosperity of the people is the
only target of this government.

2565
02:42:29,606 --> 02:42:32,769
We will shortly declare Kodanad
as a tourist village.

2566
02:42:33,510 --> 02:42:37,606
Without taking any land from other,
with the interference of..

2567
02:42:38,148 --> 02:42:41,174
..government and the support
of reputed investors,

2568
02:42:41,418 --> 02:42:44,114
we will declare Kodanad
as a township.

2569
02:42:48,058 --> 02:42:49,491
Everything has ended nicely.

2570
02:42:49,793 --> 02:42:51,260
Then what is the new problem now?

2571
02:42:51,628 --> 02:42:54,153
That is the big problem.
My marriage matter.

2572
02:42:55,298 --> 02:42:57,425
All these problem related to
my land had happened...

2573
02:42:57,801 --> 02:43:01,202
..because of the reason that a
suitable girl has come in my life.

2574
02:43:01,404 --> 02:43:03,099
That is what my father is saying now.
- ls it?

2575
02:43:03,807 --> 02:43:06,605
ln between, Sudhir spoke to Bedsy.

2576
02:43:07,210 --> 02:43:08,609
She is interested in marrying me.

2577
02:43:09,479 --> 02:43:12,448
But my father and mother
likes Sunita's proposal.

2578
02:43:12,749 --> 02:43:15,946
They all are saying that her
mother is also interested in this.

2579
02:43:17,988 --> 02:43:23,290
After knowing everything,
Maria's family has come with..

2580
02:43:23,493 --> 02:43:25,791
her proposal saying that we should
give her and opportunity to do repentance.

2581
02:43:26,663 --> 02:43:28,790
That was the proposal once
reached up to seeing the bride.

2582
02:43:28,999 --> 02:43:30,466
l can't refuse that proposal.

2583
02:43:32,002 --> 02:43:36,234
My family has told me to decide
any one among this proposal.

2584
02:43:43,847 --> 02:43:44,973
Why did you stop here?

2585
02:43:48,585 --> 02:43:49,813
She told me that she will come here.

2586
02:43:50,020 --> 02:43:50,645
Who?

2587
02:43:52,355 --> 02:43:53,322
Sir, you come.

2588
02:44:06,036 --> 02:44:10,166
Earlier when l started agriculture,
l had a confusion like this.

2589
02:44:11,041 --> 02:44:12,668
First, l thought to start
the cultivation of flowers.

2590
02:44:12,876 --> 02:44:15,674
Flowers are beautiful. lt will give
us happiness and freshness.

2591
02:44:16,713 --> 02:44:17,907
Like Bedsy.

2592
02:44:18,615 --> 02:44:21,083
After that l thought to start
the cultivation of spices.

2593
02:44:21,384 --> 02:44:23,579
Cardamom and pepper
are very costly.

2594
02:44:23,887 --> 02:44:27,789
Where ever it is put, that will match
with that and give good taste.

2595
02:44:29,059 --> 02:44:30,026
Like Maria

2596
02:44:32,495 --> 02:44:34,622
But l started vegetable cultivation.

2597
02:44:35,498 --> 02:44:38,797
Vegetables are needed everyday
in common man's life.

2598
02:44:39,236 --> 02:44:40,931
l am an ordinary man.

2599
02:44:41,238 --> 02:44:43,206
So, l need an ordinary girl.

2600
02:44:55,585 --> 02:44:57,553
Hello.
- Hi.

2601
02:45:04,895 --> 02:45:06,522
Manikutty.. Manikutty, stop there.

2602
02:45:06,763 --> 02:45:07,730
Hey! Hey! Hey!
