00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:01,900
RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

2
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:06,000
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

3
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,400
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION

4
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,700
Be patient, my soul

5
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,760
Don’t expect a remedy to your problem

6
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,860
Don’t throw yourself into a fire
and expect your lover to save you

7
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:32,160
Pearls of tears weep through
the mother of pearl of your eyes

8
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,840
Don’t expect anything from
the beloved with coral pearl lips

9
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,240
Come, do not rejoice

10
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,560
and cry, poor nightingale

11
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:51,020
Don’t expect anything from
the beloved with a mouth like rose garden

12
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,220
My Esma? My beautiful eyed and debonair woman...

13
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,740
Why are you so down?

14
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,160
What is it that bothers you?

15
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,280
Didn’t you like the poem?

16
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,400
Is it possible for me to not like a poem
from that enchanting voice of yours?

17
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,200
Is it possible for me to fall
into the darkness...

18
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,380
...while you shine my night by being here?

19
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:29,500
Don’t you know how much I dream of you and
wait for the time that I will come together with you?

20
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,480
So?

21
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,200
What is the trouble that bothers you then?
Tell me.

22
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,140
I’m just keeping my silence being afraid of
exceeding my authority, my Sultan.

23
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,120
My Esma.

24
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,260
Tell me.

25
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,040
-Sahabeddin.
-I don’t understand. Sahabeddin?

26
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,860
Did he do something to you?

27
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,620
-Did he...
-No, not like that.

28
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,200
I am only a loyal and
trusted servant in his eyes.

29
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,840
But this is my fear.

30
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,920
I fear that I might have sinned
because of him, my Sultan.

31
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,680
He trusts me more than anyone else.

32
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,900
All the secrets he hides from others,
he shares with me.

33
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,100
He didn’t even hide
the assassin from me, my Sultan.

34
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,400
I was taking food to him every day.

35
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,340
But today...

36
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,680
...the man...

37
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,860
...died with foam
coming out of his mouth.

38
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,120
I think he was poisoned, my Sultan.

39
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,820
Why didn’t you tell me, Esma?

40
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,100
I was afraid.

41
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,840
-And I am still afraid.
-What are you afraid of?

42
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,360
If Sahabeddin...

43
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,000
...poisoned that man with
the food I took there...

44
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,900
What if I gave that poison...

45
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,900
...and committed a sin by killing him?

46
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,300
It is alright, do not worry.

47
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,030
My Sultan...

48
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,300
...I knew that he was not an
innocent man...

49
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,100
...but why didn’t he punish him himself?

50
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,240
Why did he hide it from me?

51
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,240
I have not even harmed
an ant until this day.

52
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,700
-You know my heart.
-Alright.

53
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,060
-I can’t even step on an ant.
-It is alright.

54
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,820
May God forgive me.

55
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,660
What if I sinned and...

56
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,980
...killed him?

57
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,340
It is alright. Do not worry.

58
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,000
It is over.

59
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,020
Do not worry.

60
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,200
It is over.

61
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,920
Do not worry.

62
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,930
My daughter...

63
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,860
...looks like the moon.

64
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,800
Her eyebrows are like...

65
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,960
...a stretched bow.

66
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:01,030
When she waves her hair...

67
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:08,930
...she looks like a pony with long mare.

68
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,030
There will be a feast soon...

69
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:26,030
...her face will shine up the room.

70
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:33,200
She is just like a son...

71
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,800
...who will be a valiant Bey.

72
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,740
Hayme?

73
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,420
Hayme?

74
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,700
Mother Hayme? Mother Hayme, wake up.

75
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,940
-What happened, my girl?
-Do now panic, mother, it is good news.

76
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,860
Suleyman Shah called your name.

77
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,840
My Bey? My Bey?

78
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,280
My Bey, I am here.

79
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,220
-Did he say anything else?
-No, mother.

80
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,960
He only said your name.

81
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,720
My girl, may God bless you.

82
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,400
You have been teared apart here with us.

83
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,760
You did not stay with your sister...

84
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,480
...you set on the road with us.

85
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,580
Please do not say that, Mother Hayme.
I see Suleyman Shah as my father as well.

86
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,260
He has every right over me and my sister.

87
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,480
Moreover...

88
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,480
...I will be his bride soon.

89
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,980
I will call him father.

90
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,240
I pray to God every time I see you two.

91
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,740
I pray to God for a life like
yours for Ertugrul and I.

92
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:23,120
When I learned that you found me suitable
for Ertugrul and wanted me as a bride...

93
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,360
...I was honored.
-Gokce.

94
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,780
It is late now.

95
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,620
You are very tired.

96
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,320
Go and sleep, my girl.

97
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,400
I am sorry, Mother Hayme.

98
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,220
I was tactless.

99
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,140
-I only...
-Gokce.

100
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,360
Look, my girl. This is a matter of fate.

101
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,860
It’s not only up to my will.

102
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:00,220
Fate is what God has written for us.

103
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,660
Do you understand?

104
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,820
Go on, go and rest for a bit. Come on.

105
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,740
Do not fear, my Shahzada.
You will not be subjected to this.

106
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,160
You come from a noble blood.

107
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,940
Let my Turgut Aga go.

108
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:22,000
Royal people can’t grieve
for their slaves’ destiny.

109
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:27,040
They can only be worried about their purposes.

110
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,900
You cowards!
Kill me without playing around!

111
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,560
Your end will not be so easy, Turkmen.
You will beg...

112
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,340
...but you will live.

113
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,780
In a way I want you to.

114
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,200
I only have one life in which I trust my God.

115
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,920
I’m not afraid of you.

116
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,660
Sometimes people even afraid
of themselves.

117
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:06,460
If they don’t fear for themselves, they
fear for the lives of their loved ones.

118
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,320
Isn’t that so, Giovanni?

119
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,000
Oh, my brave son…

120
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,740
Don’t be confident about
your courage and youngness.

121
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,600
It’s not about being a hero.

122
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,440
There is no one here
other than God who can hear you.

123
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,340
Dear God...

124
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,260
...be my side and help me.

125
00:12:54,120 --> 00:13:00,060
Each moment you feel desperate,
remember that God is the Greatest.

126
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:08,320
Repeat to yourself that He is the one who feeds
your hunger whenever you are in need.

127
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,030
You are here with God.
Do not forget this.

128
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:20,400
And be aware of the fact that you are here,
in the Madrasa al-Yusufiyya.

129
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,220
If you are to lose your faith
and be on your own...

130
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,380
...then will they turn you into a man
who is even afraid of himself.

131
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:17,600
I will succeed with this miserable Turk
where I failed with Giovanni.

132
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,740
How long do you think it will take
for him to give in, sir?

133
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:27,200
According to the methods in this book,
he can only resist for 40 days.

134
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,920
And then?

135
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,140
I was not aware of your arrival,
dear Thomas.

136
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,600
You are like the angel of death.

137
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,920
You showed up suddenly once again.

138
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,160
How are our guests?

139
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,900
They are resting in their quarters.

140
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:53,100
Are you going to be victorious
through the mice you put in dungeons?

141
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,060
Even I can barely understand you.

142
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,000
Dear Thomas...

143
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,440
...I do not stick my nose
in your business in Europe.

144
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,760
And you should not dwell
in the matters here.

145
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,220
That is your decision. I am merely
trying to convince our Holy Father...

146
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,960
...to a new Crusade.

147
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:31,760
I will find Ibn Arabi’s chest and
the sacred relics inside sooner or later.

148
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:36,820
This is a promise and
Lord's Son shall be my witness.

149
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,980
But I will not do it
with knights like Titus.

150
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,320
I will do it through people who think
they are still Turks but...

151
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,780
...I shall decide on what they shall be.

152
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,860
How will you accomplish this?

153
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,400
With an old Asian legend.

154
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,400
We will soon see the fruits of our labour.

155
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:20,320
The Vizier is as good as dead
for El Aziz now. Aleppo will remember...

156
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,800
...Sahabeddin as a traitor
who collaborated with the Crusaders.

157
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:31,620
And I will reveal this betrayal and become
his highness Ameer’ s only trusted aide.

158
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,900
What about Ertugrul?

159
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,360
I mean Kayis...

160
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,340
...and their territory?

161
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,820
It will be resolved today, right?

162
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:48,840
Don’t you worry about it. El Aziz is
a puppet, which I hold the strings now.

163
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:53,940
Ertugrul will leave that palace
as a man who lost everything.

164
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:58,100
No, my friend. You are mistaken.

165
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:04,420
Ertugrul will understand
what he lost when he meets us.

166
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:15,320
I seek refuge in God from Satan, the Accursed one.

167
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:19,680
In the name of God, the Compassionate,
the Merciful.

168
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:22,200
Ya Sin
By the wise Qur’an

169
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,220
Ertugrul?

170
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,320
Truly you are of those sent…

171
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,140
Great God!

172
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,030
Ertugrul! Watch out!

173
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,900
Ertugrul! Watch out!

174
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,830
Thank God. You are better now.

175
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,600
Father?

176
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:00,830
Father, where is Yigit?

177
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,960
Did something happen to Yigit,
where is my brother?

178
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,100
No, my dear girl. Nothing happened to him.
He is with the Alps.

179
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,900
Calm down, your wound might
start to bleed.

180
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,860
Where are we, father?

181
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,960
We reached Aleppo, my girl.
We are at a secure place.

182
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,600
Father, why is Yigit not with us?

183
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,330
I want to see my brother.

184
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,860
You will see him tomorrow, my girl.

185
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,920
Sleep now. You should sleep.

186
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,280
Sleep and rest.

187
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,800
Dear God...

188
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:50,080
...spare these innocents.
Bring Yigit to us safe and sound.

189
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:20,200
The servant told the truth.
The man is indeed poisoned, your highness Ameer.

190
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:09,080
Akcakoca, what kind of a disaster
is this plague?

191
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,860
Didn’t we kill all those sheep
to fend it off?

192
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,460
We did, my Bey. We did but...

193
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:22,600
...this is a child’s doing. She couldn’t
sacrifice her lamb and hid it.

194
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,100
We set on the road tomorrow.
What will happen to these people?

195
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,200
My Bey, there is nothing we can do for them.

196
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,030
In a few days they will...

197
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,160
Will we leave them here?

198
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,900
I will stay with them.

199
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,460
Bey, I know there is nothing I can do...

200
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,840
...but I can relieve their pain
for a while.

201
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,940
Akcakoca...

202
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:04,180
...there are some who don’t want to
migrate. I need to talk to them.

203
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,340
If they stay here, it would be a disaster.

204
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,060
They need to know that no matter what.

205
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,500
May God make it easy for you.

206
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,060
Your highness Ameer.

207
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,200
I deliver you the greetings of Kayi...

208
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,760
...and the gratitude of my father Suleyman Shah
for the new land.

209
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,500
There have been rumours...

210
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,800
...about your tribe.

211
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,240
Is there anything you would like
to tell me Ertugrul?

212
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,360
I talked with your vizier
Sahabeddin Tugrul as well...

213
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,880
...these rumors are lies.

214
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,100
Templars who are not fond of the alliance
between us attacked our tribe.

215
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,760
Those who tried to spread disease
in our tribe and the people...

216
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,960
...who spread these rumors are the same.

217
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,580
You are lying, Ertugrul.

218
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:31,480
The enemy who you think is beyond your
borders are actually inside your palace.

219
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,260
You are not aware.

220
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,860
Your highness Ameer...

221
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,260
What are you doing here, Nasir?

222
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,880
Where is his highness the Ameer?

223
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,960
Guards.

224
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,820
How dare you?

225
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,640
Inform El Aziz immediately.

226
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,040
Calm down, Vizier.

227
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,420
This is actually the order of
his highness Ameer.

228
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,800
He personally wants to question you.

229
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,500
Is Kurdoglu not here?

230
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,740
I do not know where he is, my Bey.

231
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,400
He told me to pack his belongings
and make them ready for the caravan.

232
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,040
He is to solve an important matter
and join the caravan later.

233
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:19,920
He will join the caravan you say.
So Kurdoglu Bey will migrate with us.

234
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,740
Alpargu, tell me. Your Bey does not
do anything without informing you.

235
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,220
I really do not know, my Bey.

236
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,020
He only said that it was
about Suleyman Shah...

237
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,200
...that was all.

238
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,440
The cart shook him up more than
we expected, Mother Hayme.

239
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:10,940
You are right, Master Demir.
It is good that we stopped to rest.

240
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,920
The horses will have a chance to
rest as well.

241
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:20,320
May God give him health,
so that he can walk while entering Aleppo.

242
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,460
If God permits.

243
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,200
-Hayme.
-My Bey!

244
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,500
My Bey!

245
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,560
My Bey?

246
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,140
Come on, my girl.

247
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,300
Give our Bey some space
to have some fresh air.

248
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,020
Kurdoglu.

249
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,900
Tell me, why is the Ameer not coming?

250
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:59,460
I really do not know why his highness
is acting like this, my Vizier.

251
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:04,420
I have insisted repeatedly
but he did not want to talk.

252
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:08,160
He just gave you the assurance...

253
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:11,640
...of an absolute fair hearing...

254
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:18,000
...and that will be under my responsibility.

255
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,040
You may leave, Nasir.

256
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,300
Dear God...

257
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:52,400
...I am ready to be hurt,
but don’t let the justice be hurt.

258
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,200
Do not give the tyrants an opportunity.

259
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:01,900
Oh, Mighty God, the tyrants shall kill me
if they want...

260
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,100
...but your order which will exalt your name...

261
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,820
...shall continue forever.

262
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,900
Turkmen valiant.

263
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,940
Ertugrul Bey.

264
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,920
You won’t regret it if you turn around.

265
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:24,300
Effendi Titus says: “The eagle is in
the cage, now it is the wolf’s turn.”

266
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,330
Great God!

267
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,440
Tell me? Whose dog are you?

268
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,120
Where is my brother?
Where is the Shahzada?

269
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,760
Speak!

270
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,960
It won’t be so easy this time!

271
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:22,860
Hamza...

272
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:27,600
...are the Alps ready for
the security of the migration route?

273
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,900
They are ready, my Bey.

274
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,060
Ilyas Fakih...

275
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,780
...did you talk with the families of
the people who have to stay behind...

276
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,440
...because of this plague?

277
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,280
I did, my Bey.

278
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,980
I tried to comfort them but it is hard.

279
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,260
May God never test anyone
with their children.

280
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,420
And if He does, may He give them the patience
of Prophet Ayub.

281
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,620
Amen.

282
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,200
Akcakoca...

283
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,060
...would this plague spread outside
the confinement?

284
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:07,280
My Bey, these things cannot be known
by looking from the outside...

285
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:14,240
...but it seems that this plague
is not spreading outside.

286
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,260
If you see it fit as well...

287
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:22,260
...there is nothing else holding us back
from the journey.

288
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,440
I see it fit, me may go.

289
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,980
Then...

290
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:34,360
...for our loved ones in the graves
and for our babies in their cots...

291
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,000
...as an Oguz tribe,
we shall walk to our new homeland.

292
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:03,340
The tribe is in enough turmoil as it is,
why do you summon me here?

293
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,180
I know...

294
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:11,020
...Kurdoglu did not manage to kill
Suleyman Shah.

295
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,540
Do not feel sorrow, Selcan. It is soon.

296
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:21,380
You shall revenge the death of
your father Alpsungur.

297
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:26,300
Suleyman Shah’s death
will be from your hands.

298
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:32,460
But first there is another trouble
you need to get rid of.

299
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:36,780
-What trouble is that?
-Plague!

300
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,900
The whole tribe shall be infected soon.

301
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,020
You have to save yourself
and your son from this disease.

302
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:49,340
The ill are isolated. The animals
are burnt! What are you saying?

303
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,840
It is not over yet.

304
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,860
This evil shall take many more lives.

305
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,820
This evil does not have a remedy.

306
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,140
There is nothing else but confinement.

307
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,100
I do have a cure.

308
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,720
You should drink this every day.

309
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:17,080
It will protect you, your husband
and most importantly...

310
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,920
...your son from this evil.

311
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,700
What happened?
What were you doing here, Kurdoglu?

312
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:56,060
I rode my horse without rest
for the safety of our Bey.

313
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,280
Thank God, I made it in time.

314
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,800
My blood brother, my life brother.

315
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,240
Was it an intuition, Kurdoglu?

316
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:08,760
How did you know that something
like this might happen to our Bey?

317
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,360
Mother Hayme, this dog called
Bozok came to me a few days ago...

318
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,920
...asking me about the
death of his father.

319
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:20,260
He heard Gundogdu accusing me
in the headquarters.

320
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,500
He saw me as the killer of his father.

321
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,700
He put a knife at my throat.

322
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:31,320
I still pitied him thinking that he is in
deep sorrow, he was a boy of this tribe...

323
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:35,220
...and forgave this impudence.

324
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:43,720
But when Gundogdu mentioned that
the Bey’s tent was cut with a knife...

325
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:48,340
...God forbid,
implied that he was attacked...

326
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,180
...I thought about how some people might
have whispered something in his ear.

327
00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:01,040
Then I could not stay back, so I got on
my horse and rode until it was exhausted.

328
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,920
What happened to my tribe in two days?

329
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:11,160
Traitors have embarked, Alps have
separated and everything has fallen apart.

330
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:19,560
ALEPPO

331
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,840
You have not even blinked an eye
the whole night.

332
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,780
I have caused great distress
with the news I gave you.

333
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:30,900
You are not the reason for the matter.

334
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:35,340
Besides, thanks to you we have found out
the one who was conniving against me.

335
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:42,220
I've served for our vizier for years,
he is a very good man.

336
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:47,060
He was on the right path for years but...
-But the important thing is...

337
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:50,260
...not to be on the righteous path but
not to stray for even for a second.

338
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:55,740
Alright, Sahabeddin Tugrul
has served our state well for years...

339
00:40:55,740 --> 00:41:00,220
...but this does not mean that we shall
turn a blind eye on the things he did.

340
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:12,240
Because of the things I shared, I feel
responsible for the fate of your uncle.

341
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:18,260
Sahabeddin Tugrul’s fate shall be
whatever he deserves.

342
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:23,000
I said that whoever the traitor it is
that has colluded with the Templars...

343
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,540
...I would hang him of the bastions of the tower.
