1
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,154
Did you ever go hunting in the forest?

2
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,319
How could you?
There isn't any forest left.

3
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:36,394
Long, long ago
it was all forest here.

4
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,353
A fearsome forest -
with elephants,

5
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:48,591
bears, tigers, leopards, bison...

6
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,273
Nobody ventured to go there alone.

7
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,108
Lucky was he who caught
sight of an animal track.

8
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,076
Even in the daytime it was dark,

9
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,238
with piercing cries of the cricket...

10
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,598
...and the strange hooting of owls.

11
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:16,589
<i>Once, a prince, who was defeated</i>
<i>in battle and on the run,</i>

12
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,511
<i>entered the forest with his faithful wife</i>
<i>and precious son, seeking refuge.</i>

13
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,509
<i>At that time, a cannibal demon</i>
<i>ruled over the forest.</i>

14
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,556
<i>The prince dared to enter the forest</i>
<i>with nothing but a sword.</i>

15
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:40,316
<i>Weary from walking all day,</i>

16
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,558
<i>the prince and his family rested</i>
<i>for a while under a tree.</i>

17
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,071
<i>Suddenly, a yell resounded</i>
<i>throughout the forest.</i>

18
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:57,157
<i>Alerted, the prince stood guard</i>
<i>with his sword drawn.</i>

19
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,239
<i>The demon came along,</i>
<i>as the earth shook underfoot.</i>

20
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,994
<i>The demon let out a roar of delight</i>
<i>as he eyed them up.</i>

21
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,756
<i>The prince asked,</i>
<i>"What do you want with me?"</i>

22
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,678
<i>The demon roared with laughter.</i>

23
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,590
<i>Eyeing the boy, crouching behind</i>
<i>his father, the demon gloated,</i>

24
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,871
<i>"Tender flesh! Tender blood!"</i>

25
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,679
<i>The prince asserted,</i>
<i>"I'll finish you, you demon!"</i>

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,869
<i>The demon mocked him,</i>
<i>"Don't be rash</i>

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,709
<i>"You lost the battle, you're fleeing.</i>
<i>You must be tired.</i>

28
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,515
<i>"If you fight,</i>
<i>I'll slay all three of you. "</i>

29
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,313
<i>This irritated the prince,</i>
<i>"Really!"</i>

30
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,555
<i>The demon said,</i>

31
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,952
<i>"We can avoid a confrontation</i>
<i>if you give me your son.</i>

32
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,792
<i>"I'll spare you and your wife.</i>

33
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,038
<i>"As for the son,</i>
<i>you can always have another. "</i>

34
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,350
<i>The prince thought for a while.</i>

35
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:20,193
<i>"Hurry up. Make up your mind.</i>
<i>I'm hungry", the demon insisted.</i>

36
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:28,029
<i>The prince said,</i>
<i>"We'll be spared. All right.</i>

37
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:34,155
<i>"We could have a son. All right.</i>
<i>But you will still be here!</i>

38
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,716
<i>"What will be the fate</i>
<i>of other boys traversing this forest?"</i>

39
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,358
Not waiting for a reply
the prince, sword in hand,

40
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,438
rushed towards the demon.

41
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,593
It's tough.
It's a breech birth.

42
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,431
Dear God, let its mother be safe!

43
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,797
This will take time.
Let's go out for a while.

44
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,708
Can we not celebrate?

45
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,229
The pain started last night.

46
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,430
She's delivered a boy -
but he won't cry.

47
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,154
Hold it upside down
and give it a smack.

48
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,998
<i>Salutations to Lord Ganapati</i>

49
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,479
<i>Salutations to the Sun</i>
<i>and all the planets</i>

50
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,271
<i>Salutations to the Gurus</i>
<i>and the divinities</i>

51
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:24,589
<i>(Quoting Sanskrit verse on astrology)</i>

52
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,271
Reading the planetary positions,
the child should come feet first.

53
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,240
The mother or the child
could be handicapped - or worse.

54
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,195
By God's grace,
nothing happened.

55
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,359
Yes, madam, I can see it here.

56
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,753
Still, he may be handicapped
as I see it.

57
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,595
It could be a minor affliction.

58
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:13,558
It could be
just a simple bruise.

59
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:21,398
Or there might just be a slight wound.

60
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,111
I don't know
if I should say this or not.

61
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,279
He is not destined

62
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:44,873
to feel the warmth
of paternal affection.

63
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,710
The less said the better.

64
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,550
A good job and good family...
It seemed an ideal match.

65
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,475
Shukra, the presiding planet,

66
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:14,675
is in an unfavourable position,
and there is a sign of sin.

67
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,793
The moon isn't favourable either.

68
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:27,311
The mother will be distressed,
both mentally and physically.

69
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,597
Was the post office open,
Veluchar?

70
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,678
Yes. I posted the letter too.

71
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,831
One too many I'd say.

72
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:45,228
The man is rude
not even to acknowledge them.

73
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,989
Why do you belittle yourself?

74
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,156
Will you get that bird for me?

75
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:55,229
- Sure. But isn't it Friday today?
- Yes.

76
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,954
It's a sin to trap a bird on a Friday.

77
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,275
- We'll do it on Sunday.
- You won't forget?

78
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,472
Me? Forget? Now get going.

79
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,358
Veluchar...
Can you recite the vowels?

80
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,710
How can I?
I haven't been taught.

81
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,233
But you're grown up?

82
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,430
What can I say?

83
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,916
I was born. I grew up.
I know not how.

84
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,512
Walk fast. Otherwise
the teacher will punish me.

85
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,831
When you leave me at school
won't you be lonely?

86
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,033
Where is the time to be lonely
with all those chores?

87
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,872
Is there no end to this learning?

88
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,992
This is nothing.
You have so much more to learn.

89
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,475
No, I can't.

90
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,913
How can it be? You've got
to pass all those major exams

91
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,031
to become an important officer.

92
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:03,557
Ka, Kha, Ga, Gha, Nga.

93
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:09,118
Cha, Chcha, Ja, Jha, Nha.

94
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:14,758
Tta, Ttha, Dta, Dtha, Nna.

95
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,113
Ta, Tha, Da, Dha, Na.

96
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:27,396
Pa, Pha, Ba, Bha, Ma.

97
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,358
Master...

98
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,232
Master Kunjunni.

99
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,356
Recite the lesson.

100
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,075
Ka!

101
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,509
K... K... K... Ka...

102
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,676
Not K... K... Ka!

103
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,833
K... K... K... Ka.

104
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,517
Write...

105
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,035
Ka!

106
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,316
- K... K... K... Ka.
- Not K... K... Ka!

107
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,313
Mummy!

108
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,155
Mummy!

109
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,599
Veluchar...

110
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,232
Why are you crying, my child?

111
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,590
Meenakshi frightened me.

112
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,156
How dare she?

113
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,195
Assured of three meals a day,
she has grown presumptuous.

114
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,155
Who are you scolding,
Veluchar?

115
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:56,273
That Janamma's daughter.
She's too conceited.

116
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,994
I don't hit her
because she's still a little girl.

117
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,999
Let it be.
We shouldn't fight with kids.

118
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,956
Why do you always fight
with her, my child?

119
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:09,196
He's still a kid. Haven't I told you
not to trouble him?

120
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,993
Will you do it again?

121
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,756
Ka, Kha, Ga, Gha, Nga...

122
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,518
Cha... Cha... Chcha.
Ja... Ja... Jha... Nha...

123
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,551
Tta, Ttha, Dta, Dtha, Nna...

124
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,877
Ta... Ta... Tha... Da... Da... Dha... Na...

125
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:13,717
Pa... Pha... Ba... Bha... Ma...

126
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,237
Ya... Ya... Ra...
La... La... Va... Sa...

127
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,633
Sha, Sa, Ha, Lla, Zha, Ra...

128
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,711
Here comes your father.

129
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,310
Get a move on...

130
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,476
Mother is in for a beating today.

131
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,796
Hurry now...

132
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,790
He's in good form.

133
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,595
Why are you loitering about?

134
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,957
- Why is the master here?
- Nothing.

135
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,836
I'll get you a strand
of the elephant's tail.

136
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,996
Let it grow some more.

137
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,480
His family owned two elephants!

138
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,990
How times have changed!

139
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,118
Come on...

140
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,834
36... 36...

141
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,914
37... 37...

142
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,318
38... 38...

143
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,750
- Is what I hear true, Pachupillai?
- Not at all, madam.

144
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,155
Rumour has it
you have a woman up north.

145
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,955
Oh, no. Nothing of the sort.
They saw me at Trichur fair.

146
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,469
That was enough
to set tongues wagging.

147
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,589
- Have you eaten?
- No, madam.

148
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,871
Then go and get something to eat.

149
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,991
39... 39...

150
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,039
40... 40...

151
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,715
41... 41...

152
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,032
Come here, my child.

153
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,996
Where were you all this time?

154
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,276
Roaming in the sun all day...

155
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,392
You'll come down with a fever
by the time school starts again.

156
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,510
What's wrong with you?

157
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,156
Where are the kids?

158
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,875
So you're concerned?!

159
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,511
Damn you. If you whine too much...

160
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,230
They've both gone to fetch some milk.

161
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,798
Thank God,
you remember them!

162
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,433
Are you going to stop whining
or shall I leave?

163
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,030
Don't forget, you're an old hag
with no prospects...

164
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,037
You were thrust upon me...

165
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,237
Don't provoke me...

166
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,358
- Take this.
- What is it?

167
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,755
Your favourite - molasses.

168
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,392
Come on,
I'll show you something.

169
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,308
Now what's this?
Did you have a fall?

170
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,590
You ran after the squirrel,
didn't you?

171
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,037
I'll tell your mother.

172
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:03,273
Or so be it.
Next time, no excuses.

173
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,356
You keep quiet, too.

174
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,832
Master Kunjunni's come
to see you eat.

175
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,391
This is nothing.
You should watch the elephant eat.

176
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,274
A keeper of the elephant
should eat like an elephant.

177
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,798
And you do bring in
all your earnings here!

178
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,432
Let's go.
The fight starts here...

179
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,552
Indigestion, isn't it?

180
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:48,157
She's pale
from a deficiency of the blood.

181
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:55,676
When I wake up in the morning
or get up after resting

182
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,951
I get dizzy
and it makes me blackout.

183
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,318
<i>(Quoting from 'Ashtanga Hrudaya',</i>
<i>the Sanskrit Treatise on Ayurveda)</i>

184
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,278
Take care.
The cycle will fall on the boy.

185
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,039
My dear child, leave it.

186
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,993
If you get caught
in the wheels...

187
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,350
Go and eat something.

188
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,835
You've been running
around since morning.

189
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,236
A little food would do
but it should be regular.

190
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,636
She never eats
a proper meal.

191
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,320
She's always complaining
of a poor appetite.

192
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,791
The following
Ayurvedic medical remedies...

193
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,228
<i>(A list of Ayurvedic herbs)</i>

194
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:55,232
All of these herb treatments

195
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,989
should be crushed and boiled in water,

196
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,078
and then proceed according
to instruction. Distilled and garnished,

197
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:13,036
they should be taken
twice a day before meals.

198
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:18,799
I'll send the <i>'Lehyam'.</i>
Take both without fail for a few days.

199
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,471
Father?

200
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,877
That's better left unsaid.

201
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,076
You want to ride the bike?

202
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,030
You'll graze your knees though.

203
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,191
- What is the young master reading?
- "Balachandran".

204
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,232
Read aloud, master.
Let me hear too.

205
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,476
Then you read it.

206
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,308
- May I? From the start?
- Yes.

207
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,191
"Balachandran woke up
early that morning.

208
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:17,393
"Rubbing his eyes,
he came out of the room.

209
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,353
"His mother was sitting
on the verandah,

210
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,950
"her hands folded in prayer.

211
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,833
"When he looked at her face,

212
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,033
"he saw that her eyes
were filled with tears.

213
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,469
"His heart hurt inside him.

214
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,797
"He knelt beside his mother

215
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:41,391
"and wiped away her tears
with the palms of his hands

216
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,670
"and asked,
'Ma, are you crying?"'

217
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,553
Veluchar, Janamma,
come, quick!

218
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,315
- Oh my God.
- Oh.

219
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,230
Bring some water. Hurry.

220
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,348
What happened to you, my child?

221
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,437
I was going down to the courtyard
and I started feeling dizzy.

222
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,437
That's all I remember.

223
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:41,874
If I die, who will be there for my son!

224
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,399
Oh, don't talk foolishness!

225
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:27,074
<i>Lord Rama, take care of me</i>

226
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,716
<i>Let your feet be my refuge</i>

227
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,197
Aren't you asleep?

228
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,869
May I sleep here with you?

229
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,752
Won't you be cold?

230
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:48,078
I like to sleep next to you.

231
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,875
I'm also very fond of you,
my beloved child.

232
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:59,119
<i>Let your grace</i>
<i>take away all suffering</i>

233
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:03,950
<i>Oh! Rama, take care of me</i>

234
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,311
<i>Let your feet be my refuge</i>

235
00:32:15,841 --> 00:32:18,080
Are my parents cross
with each other?

236
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,310
Why don't you speak?

237
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,356
How will Veluchar know?

238
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,634
It's fate.
What else can I say?

239
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,109
Do you have any children?

240
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,312
Veluchar has no wife,
no kids.

241
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,870
All I have is you folk.

242
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,436
You get some sleep now.
You have school tomorrow.

243
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:08,432
<i>Oh! Rama, take care of me</i>

244
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:13,395
<i>Let your feet be my refuge</i>

245
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,795
Why are you crying?

246
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,316
Why is he crying?

247
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,836
What's the matter?

248
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,191
Has someone been making fun
of your stammer?

249
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,198
- No.
- Then?

250
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:54,636
Teacher Ramakrishnan
called him a 'petit bourgeois'.

251
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,274
What?

252
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,152
'Petit bourgeois'.

253
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,074
The whole class laughed at him.

254
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,715
What is this 'bourgeois', Veluchar?

255
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,308
It must be something obscene.

256
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:20,228
That low caste teacher
is an impudent fellow.

257
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:25,388
The other day he was walking
by our gate with his sandals on.

258
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,476
How times have changed!

259
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,076
I ignored him.

260
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,512
It's all the doing
of that Gandhi chap.

261
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,313
Saying all are equal!

262
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,277
Veluchar is allergic
to the very name Gandhi.

263
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,033
How can it be otherwise?

264
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:50,755
What happened to the sole heir
of that family who was sent to England?

265
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,316
It only forced the family
to sell off acres of prime land.

266
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:59,038
He wandered off with Gandhi.

267
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,911
What hopes we had for him!

268
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,191
That's all fate.
His father died, pining for him.

269
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:11,791
Vasu was languishing
in some jail in the North.

270
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,270
<i>In that case, you listen to us</i>

271
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,550
<i>Go and ask your family</i>
<i>whether they would share</i>

272
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:23,595
<i>The sins you have amassed</i>
<i>for their sake</i>

273
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:29,317
<i>We shall wait till you return</i>

274
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,434
<i>Thus advised,</i>
<i>I asked my wife and children</i>

275
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:39,270
<i>Whether they would share</i>
<i>the sins I had committed</i>

276
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:44,269
<i>In my efforts</i>
<i>to keep them happy?</i>

277
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,278
<i>Or am I to be the sole inheritor</i>
<i>of these sins?</i>

278
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:53,032
<i>And they replied,</i>
<i>"The consequence of one's action</i>

279
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,993
<i>"is to be confronted by oneself"</i>

280
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,997
I said, who's that?

281
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,348
- It's me, Veluchar.
- My God!

282
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,549
My master! Master Vasu.

283
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:14,477
Vasu, my son.
Is this true or a mere illusion?

284
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,274
Mother, you must pardon
this son of yours.

285
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,995
I did not fulfil a son's duties.

286
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:26,113
I'm happy
I can see my son again at last!

287
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,470
Aren't you well?

288
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,068
She has been ill for quite some time.

289
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,033
We've tried all sorts of cures
to no avail.

290
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,797
Have you eaten anything?

291
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,230
Good that you asked.
I've been hungry for three days.

292
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:03,638
I had to travel without a ticket
from Secunderabad.

293
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,157
Is it true
that the British are leaving India?

294
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,430
Maybe, yes.

295
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,836
Aren't you with Gandhi now?

296
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,829
No. Just the British leaving
won't bring real freedom.

297
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,474
It will take a real revolution.

298
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,996
Are you for murder and mayhem?

299
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:58,078
No, Mother.
You wouldn't understand it.

300
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:03,591
Wasn't Satyagraha enough for you?

301
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,114
Each one of us
has only one life to live.

302
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,992
Then it is to be wasted!

303
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,793
The food is delicious.
Who cooked it?

304
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,515
When you're hungry
any food is tasty.

305
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,200
Now, you stop wandering
and stay here.

306
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:38,314
Do you want to see
the police come and handcuff me?

307
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,795
But then you haven't committed
any crime!

308
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:45,118
I've been accused
of many crimes, rightly and wrongly.

309
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,719
Including murder.

310
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:50,753
To fool the police, I have to
keep moving, use false names...

311
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,196
Oh my God!

312
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:17,237
How are you?
You've been away for quite some time.

313
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,918
I was logging.

314
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,713
- Is that job over?
- Yes, madam.

315
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,638
Do you know,
your wife has given birth?

316
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,950
It's been a few months now... a girl.

317
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,750
After the lumber job,
the landlord sold off the elephant.

318
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:43,628
I couldn't come empty-handed
to see the newborn.

319
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,319
But this is not
your wife's family home!

320
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,597
There's our father.

321
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,749
Do you have a job at present?

322
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:19,633
Nothing to speak of.
I'm a broker of sorts.

323
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:24,595
I help arrange weddings -
after much running around.

324
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,154
Sometimes I get paid,
sometimes not.

325
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:32,114
If the girl has a handicap,
I get paid better.

326
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:39,114
There are also ungrateful wretches
who ignore me once the deal is done.

327
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,429
So you are a go-between?

328
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,916
Are you here for a while?

329
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,796
Yes, madam.

330
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,595
- Janamma...
- Yes, Ma'am.

331
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:28,635
From now on, let your husband
sleep out on the verandah.

332
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,910
He could sleep next to Veluchar.

333
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,316
Gandhi has been shot dead.

334
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,192
No!

335
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:53,399
On his way to a prayer meeting -
last evening.

336
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,112
Oh my God!

337
00:42:56,360 --> 00:43:01,593
How could anyone kill a man who
has preached non-violence all his life?

338
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,752
I never wished him any harm.

339
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,988
Where did you hear this?

340
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:13,192
The congress men
are holding a meeting of condolence.

341
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,595
They are coming this way.

342
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:08,910
Don't cry my child.
We are helpless.

343
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:08,360
There's something under your nose.
Didn't you wipe your face after eating?

344
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,232
Oh, it's nothing.

345
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:16,070
There should be water in the jug.
Wash your face well.

346
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,634
- I'll tell your mother.
- What?

347
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,711
You think nobody noticed?

348
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:33,753
You've smeared on bear's fat
to help you sprout a moustache.

349
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:37,919
You think you're too clever.
I'll smear it on your face too!

350
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,634
Give it to me. I want it.

351
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:43,228
Not so easy!

352
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:56,354
Are you studying?
Did I disturb you, Kunjunni?

353
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,439
- No, I've been writing.
- Then I'm all the more guilty.

354
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,516
Don't be so formal.

355
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,709
Why have you left
the mail unopened?

356
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:21,354
They're my stories
which have been rejected by magazines.

357
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,516
You could still open them.

358
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,119
I thought I would take them
in one lot.

359
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:31,438
And then publish a collection,
"Stories That Returned".

360
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,795
What about
"Love Stories That Returned"?

361
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:42,118
Insinuation noted.
Is love forbidden for communists?

362
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:46,597
Don't be cross. Who am I
to tell a writer what to do?

363
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,234
Will you be offended
if I ask you something?

364
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:53,638
Never. I have no such
fickle sentiments.

365
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,114
Why do you always snub me?

366
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:01,199
Deep down inside you're still a feudalist.

367
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,832
- Here comes the Master!
- Where is he?

368
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,711
Look, the Master is here!

369
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:18,112
I spotted a man in the distance...

370
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,836
When I looked again...

371
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,599
Are you feeling better?

372
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:05,790
They say I look better
since I came back from the hospital.

373
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:14,278
It must be the strong drugs.
She is a little weak.

374
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:24,479
She is still on
the Ayurvedic treatment.

375
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,516
Did you eat anything?

376
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,599
You must be hungry.
It's a long bus ride.

377
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,710
- When did you come?
- Yesterday.

378
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,550
- I cried a lot last night.
- Why?

379
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:55,593
There was this book on your table,
"The Childhood Friend".

380
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:01,189
I read it and towards the end
I could not contain myself.

381
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:05,108
Why were Suhra and Majid
fated to suffer all the time?

382
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,708
So, you do read books?

383
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,916
Higher studies were denied me.

384
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,918
But your mother would give me
the books she read.

385
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,759
I would also read to her
when she was ill.

386
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,678
You seem to be growing day by day.

387
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,517
You too.
You have the moustache now.

388
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:32,074
Thanks to the bear fat!

389
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:54,036
- When are you going back?
- Day after tomorrow.

390
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,117
LAND REFORMS BILL PASSED

391
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:08,277
The tenants don't even
give us what's owed to us.

392
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,960
And now this law...
How are we to survive?

393
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:16,639
Legally, now the land
belongs to the tenants.

394
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,078
Voting the communists to power
was ruinous, as was feared.

395
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,760
That's how it seems
because we stand to lose.

396
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:29,839
But doesn't the land
belong to the tiller?

397
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,712
What are you saying?

398
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,476
Are you a Commie too?

399
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:55,315
Veluchar, she is very ill.

400
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:02,189
Even after all those visits
to the hospital?

401
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,790
She wants to see Kunjunni.

402
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:10,190
Go and fetch him
from the hostel as soon as you can.

403
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,596
Isn't his father
in Trivandrum too?

404
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:15,472
Inform him as well.

405
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:11,716
Where's her husband?
Veluchar went all that way to tell him!

406
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:19,036
Despite the distance, Kunjunni
should have been here before she died.

407
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:25,753
If he were coming,
surely he'd be here by now.

408
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,950
Touch the feet and prostrate.

409
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,552
Sanctify the ritual ring
and wear it.

410
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:17,032
Pick up the jug
and walk around three times.

411
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,350
You know Janamma...

412
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:43,075
I don't like to send you off like this.

413
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,192
I see you as one of us.

414
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:50,675
I don't need to tell you,
times have changed.

415
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:55,633
The tenants have ruthlessly taken over
what little we had.

416
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:04,633
We had to pawn and pledge
properties for Kunjunni's tuition.

417
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:08,799
To pay off debts,
he must finish his studies and find a job.

418
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,952
You keep this.

419
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:22,918
Lack of gold should
not be a bar to your marriage.

420
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:31,595
Now don't pledge or pawn this.
This is hers.

421
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,152
Tell me when a marriage
has been arranged for her.

422
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:53,792
Who is going to want a woman
with neither house nor land?

423
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:37,354
We take leave of you, madam.

424
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:50,353
We take leave of you, Master.

425
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,912
We take leave of you.

426
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:30,680
POLICEMAN KILLED
Commies Attack Police Station

427
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:33,592

CONSTABLE MURDERED

00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:44,711
NAXALITES STRIKE AGAIN
Extremists on a Rampage

431
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:49,630
POLICE STATION ATTACKED
Constable Shot Dead

432
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:54,788
CONSPIRACY Y TO OVERTHROW LEFT
FRONT GOVERNMENT IN KERALA

433
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:47,752
Are you Kunjunni? Move out.
We have to search this place.

434
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:49,916
- Do you have a warrant?
- Yes.

435
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:08,597
REVOLUTION THROUGH
THE BARREL OF A GUN

436
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:11,473
NAXALITE PEASANT REVOLT

437
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,352
MAO ZEDONG's

438
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:17,189
THE FOOLISH OLD MAN
WHO REMOVED THE MOUNTAINS

439
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:19,914
LET A THOUSAND THOUGHTS
CONFRONT...

440
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,996
POWER TO THE PEOPLE

441
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,679
My Lord, have mercy.

442
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:40,032
Our young master
has done no wrong.

443
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:44,797
He wouldn't hurt a fly.

444
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:49,994
To charge him with murder?
God will show no forgiveness.

445
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:58,310
Damn nuisance.
Throw this old man out.

446
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:00,237
Who let him in?

447
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:04,069
His grandmother is on her deathbed.

448
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:07,880
Please let him out for a last visit.

449
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:11,037
Let her die. Then we'll see.

450
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:12,912
Have you no feelings?

451
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,318
That's enough.

452
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:22,237
Come here.

453
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:31,668
Move, or you'll get hurt!

454
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:38,276
This is a chance to slip away.

455
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,868
Come with me.
I'll wait in the lane.

456
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:45,318
No, I won't.

457
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,596
Who are you looking for?

458
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:23,712
- Veluchar?
- Yes.

459
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:28,231
He was here a while ago.
He should be somewhere here.

460
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:30,992
I'll bring him.

461
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:33,718
Must leave now.

462
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:07,310
He's not here.
Where could he be?

463
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,158
Get going.

464
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:41,310
Enough of trying to change the world.
Look after yourself first.

465
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:51,754
Quite a knowledgeable guy.
You can listen to him for hours.

466
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:54,235
We can't fault him.

467
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:57,079
Poor fellow.
He took idealism too far.

468
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:00,875
Anyway the court let him free.

469
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:42,428
Do you know a Pachu Pillai?

470
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,754
He was a mahout once.
Now he's a marriage broker...

471
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:58,356
Do you want to meet him
or call at his house?

472
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:00,755
He won't be in a fit state
to meet now.

473
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:03,758
He is out there
in the toddy shop.

474
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:07,555
You go straight this way
and then turn right.

475
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:10,717
Go further and you find
an electricity pole.

476
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:12,796
Next to that is his house.

477
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:15,870
See you.

478
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:23,596
I've seen him somewhere.

479
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:28,157
Didn't you recognise him?
Accused in the Naxal case.

480
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:30,874
He's one of the two
who were acquitted.

481
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:07,108
How did you find this place?
Who guided you?

482
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:09,800
I looked for you
and I found you.

483
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:14,313
I spent a long time searching.

484
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:23,910
Is that Vanajakshi?

485
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:28,273
Oh no.
She is the youngest.

486
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:31,517
It has been a long time.
The kids are grown up.

487
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:35,079
We could somehow
marry off Vanajakshi.

488
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:39,516
It would be a great relief
if I could find a boy for her too.

489
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:55,393
Who could have imagined
you would have to go through all this?

490
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,991
Meenakshi...

491
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:09,432
She has been our only worry.

492
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:12,552
Many had come,
charmed by her looks.

493
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:16,116
No dowry,
no gold demanded...

494
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:19,551
But she won't agree.

495
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:25,229
Now she is learning dressmaking
from a neighbour.

496
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,470
She should be here any moment.

497
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:44,199
You didn't forget us...

498
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,072
I heard the police tortured you.

499
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:02,908
Hardly a day passed
without tears.

500
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:09,392
I couldn't...

501
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:12,557
Will you come with me?

502
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:16,478
I've been waiting so long
to hear you say that...

503
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:50,076
Master, when did you come?

504
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:53,276
Did you have a good time in jail?

505
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:10,150
- Listen, you come here.
- Leave me.

506
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:13,716
- Now, what is it?
- I've got to tell you something.

507
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:16,308
Tell and be damned.

508
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:19,156
I'll tell you, come inside.

509
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:22,238
That's it. Speak politely and I'll come.

510
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:35,834
Master has come
to take her with him.

511
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:38,190
- What did you say?
- It's not for me to say.

512
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:44,111
If it's up to me,
then I won't let her.

513
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:47,198
- Not so loud!
- What if I speak loud?

514
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:50,517
A stuttering criminal
is not fit for my daughter.

515
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:53,871
What are you saying?
Some father!

516
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:57,632
Then you do one thing.

517
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:01,753
If he insists, tell him to pay
10,000 rupees and take her away.

518
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:05,111
He can't have her for free.

519
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:06,798
I'll pay you.

520
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:09,878
So, you would sell
your daughter for a drink!

521
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:36,512
- You don't recognise me!
- Uncle Vasu!

522
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:46,671
Praise be to God.

523
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:54,750
It's quite hot.
Get me some buttermilk.

524
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:56,438
Meenakshi...

525
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:02,078
So you married
Janamma's daughter?

526
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:05,718
Good.

527
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,991
Buttermilk for Uncle Vasu.

528
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:34,155
I heard Veluchar went away
the day Mother died.

529
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:36,077
Is there any news of him?

530
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:38,916
No, nothing.

531
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:43,356
Karma works in strange ways.

532
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:48,197
- And your father...
- I think he's alive.

533
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:09,553
The saffron?

534
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:16,156
A communist
in saffron coloured clothes?

535
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:19,238
Come to think of it,
it's a thin line.

536
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:23,313
One may be accused of selfishness.

537
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:27,710
But what I need is peace of mind.

538
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:30,551
The journey in search of <i>Atman.</i>

539
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:34,671
In Surat...

540
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,995
All that you heard is true.

541
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:42,999
As the man of the house,
I have three daughters and a son.

542
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:48,119
Their mother has a job, so to speak.

543
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:52,992
But it's a hard life...

544
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:00,316
Much of my life
was spent in jails and in hiding.

545
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:07,830
I failed to provide for them
in any way.

546
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:15,036
A poor husband and father!

547
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:28,390
We are the only two heirs
to this house and compound.

548
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:31,557
I can claim only if you consent.

549
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:35,069
I don't belong anywhere.

550
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:39,631
The mother and kids
won't come here either.

551
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:45,477
And you don't need
a house as big as this.

552
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:52,149
Here is their address.

553
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:54,840
If ever this house
and compound are sold,

554
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:59,357
you can send
my share to them.

555
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:09,870
You could register the deed
even in my absence.

556
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:15,355
Here is the Power of Attorney.

557
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:27,719
- Have you preserved Mother's ashes?
- Yes.

558
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:34,755
I haven't discharged
any of my duties as a son.

559
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:40,148
I'll make it up...

560
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:47,910
...by consigning her remains
to the holy river Ganges.

561
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:48,998
- Is our son asleep?
- Yes, he has been for a while.

562
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:58,912
Once you sit down to write,
you lose all sense of time.

563
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:04,959
Come to think of it,
it's a paradox.

564
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:09,437
Time doesn't go anywhere.
It's us who go.

565
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,870
How many have come and gone?

566
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:19,677
A huge ship rusted and leaky
abandoned at sea.

567
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:23,076
Waiting for its final immersion...

568
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:26,397
And we inside... like rats...

569
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:34,877
He has woken up.

570
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:32,396
No one here?

571
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:48,468
Come in, please.

572
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:07,796
Excuse me, I can't place you.

573
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:11,593
I'll tell you.
First let me ask you.

574
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:15,430
Is this house for sale?

575
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:17,755
If you sell, I want to buy it.

576
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:22,635
I'll pay 1,000 rupees more
than the best offer.

577
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:27,476
Seated there inside the car
is my father.

578
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:33,030
He's over 80 years old.
And that's not all.

579
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:37,948
In days gone by,
long before you were born,

580
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:40,230
my father was a servant in this house.

581
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:45,279
You didn't say anything
about the sale of the house.

582
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:48,913
We'll sell it, it's for sale.

583
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:52,633
Fine, let's strike the deal
today then.

584
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:56,319
By the way,
there is one condition...

585
01:23:56,440 --> 01:24:01,753
Up there on the first floor,
is there a carved bedstead?

586
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:03,677
Yes.

587
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:08,076
That bedstead
should be part of the deed.

588
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:11,351
Not because the carvings
are in fashion.

589
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:15,268
It seems once my father
dared sit on that bed of the Master.

590
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:18,597
And he was badly beaten
by the manager.

591
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:22,952
Bitter as he is,
he wants to own it and die on it.

592
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:26,952
What is the good of having
all this wealth

593
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:33,394
if we can't cater
to a small wish such as this?

594
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:35,317
You are right.

595
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:40,872
Won't your father come up?

596
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,150
After the deed is finalised.

597
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:50,477
Is this Kunjunni Sir's house?

598
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:56,591
- This is the house.
- Is he in?

599
01:26:56,720 --> 01:26:59,678
He's here now.
Go and call Father.

600
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:09,195
It has been a long search.
I tried many houses.

601
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:12,909
Has it been long
since you moved here?

602
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:14,792
About ten years.

603
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:29,394
You are?

604
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:33,670
I have come from Trivandrum.

605
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:37,955
Please come in and sit down.

606
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:10,876
You're from the police,
aren't you?

607
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:14,357
Why would you think that?

608
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:17,470
The state of emergency.

609
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:21,878
I hear all those with a police record
are being rounded up.

610
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,436
Oh, no. I have nothing
to do with the police.

611
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:30,111
I am a school teacher.

612
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:36,112
Your father happens to be
my father too.

613
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:49,799
There was no formal wedding.

614
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:52,434
They just lived together.

615
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,117
I have two younger sisters.

616
01:28:57,240 --> 01:28:59,356
They're married and settled.

617
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:02,475
We're all fairly well off.

618
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:08,153
We were already grown up

619
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:10,953
when we heard
of his marriage - and of you.

620
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:16,797
You may find it hard
to forgive your father.

621
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:20,229
Yet I decided to risk it.

622
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:28,511
He's been bedridden for the past six
years. He's suffered many illnesses.

623
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:31,234
Once one illness has been cured,
he falls ill again.

624
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:33,715
We do our best for him.

625
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:37,711
But his days are numbered.

626
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:46,589
He has been talking about you lately.

627
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:50,718
He would like to see you
before he dies.

628
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:55,471
He's been unusually insistent
for the last two days.

629
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:04,872
I came myself as anyone else
may not be as persuasive.

630
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:44,275
Is Father a mere procreator?

631
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:51,710
I understand you.
I wouldn't blame you.

632
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:57,155
His act may be inexcusable...

633
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:03,600
But it is the last wish
of a penitent old man.

634
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:15,640
Father, put your shirt on
and go with him.

635
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:19,514
You too will be old.
And you too will be ill...

636
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:40,390
- Give me something to drink.
- I'll make tea for you.

637
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:15,673
Mother, Father is here.

638
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:23,956
It was all over by the time
I got there.

639
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:33,194
You can't have eaten.
Would you like some tea?

640
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:39,189
Give him his food.
I'll have a bath.

641
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:07,469
I've finished my book...

642
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:10,433
But I have to make some changes.

643
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:49,351
Do you remember me?
Thomas Tharakan.

644
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:52,472
You may not remember me.
I'm much younger than you.

645
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:55,398
I was only little.

646
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:59,798
Perhaps that was
why they used me as a courier.

647
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:02,195
Those were happy times.

648
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:06,588
While they raided
the lodge and the press,

649
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:09,473
the police were looking
for me too.

650
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:13,194
While you went
to prison like a man,

651
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:16,995
I managed to worm my way out.

652
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:19,793
Neither was I involved
in the 'action'.

653
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:22,878
Yet, a nagging guilty conscience...

654
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:24,479
It doesn't matter.

655
01:34:28,040 --> 01:34:29,837
It's going to rain.

656
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:32,554
That means I start
the vehicle and get lost.

657
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:35,831
But you can't dismiss me so easily.

658
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:38,713
I'm here to interview you
for my paper.

659
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:42,276
We're starting a series
called "Roots of the Revolution".

660
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:46,951
Now the political climate is right.
Uncertainties are over...

661
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:49,878
The Left Front
has come to power.

662
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,993
It's time for you to speak out.
We want a really explosive interview!

663
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:06,312
May I come with you?

664
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:10,152
Not for the interview.

665
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:12,669
And if it's not for the interview,
then what?

666
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:14,552
You're welcome.

667
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:35,551
That's plenty, thanks.

668
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:48,796
I recognised you
the moment I saw you.

669
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:52,959
And yet you stood
unmoved like a granite wall!

670
01:35:55,360 --> 01:36:01,515
I can offer nothing
to entertain your readers.

671
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:11,280
You hinted you had
the right connections...

672
01:36:11,400 --> 01:36:15,393
Can you find a publisher for me?

673
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:23,116
Not for your dry dialectical discourses.
What's that stuff about?

674
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,878
It's difficult to categorise.

675
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:30,470
It could be fact or fiction.

676
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:35,357
Where is it?
Let me check a few pages...

677
01:36:35,480 --> 01:36:37,232
Then I'll decide.

678
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:44,791
"'The Hard Consonants',
Kunjunni"

679
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:51,474
- Really explosive!
- Is it?

680
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:56,198
I know a publisher
who would take the risk.

681
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:59,949
Your job is done.
Leave the rest to me.

682
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:25,232
"'The Hard Consonants' banned.

683
01:38:26,680 --> 01:38:29,911
"Government bans novel by Kunjunni,
the former Naxal leader.

684
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:34,432
"The State Government
has issued an ordinance

685
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:39,031
"restraining the publishers

686
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:43,915
"'The Hard Consonants' by Kunjunni,

687
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:49,034
"It is illegal to possess copies

688
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:55,349
"The book has had record sales
and received much critical attention.

689
01:38:55,480 --> 01:39:00,349
"This expository novel has sent
shock waves among political circles.

690
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:04,678
- "This is Kunjunni's first novel..."
- Let me have a look.

691
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:22,556
THE HARD CONSONANTS BANNED

692
01:39:22,680 --> 01:39:26,514
"Government bans novel by Kunjunni,
the former Naxal leader..."

693
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:38,950
Now let's wait for the arrest!

694
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:00,275
How ugly is the face of truth?!

695
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:03,198
So, let's act
without touching anybody,

696
01:40:03,320 --> 01:40:07,074
without disturbing anything!
What do you say?

697
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:13,309
Hiding, hedging,
cowering, fearing, shivering...

698
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:15,874
Mother, did you hear?
Father doesn't stammer!

699
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,070
He has no stammer!

700
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:21,872
Ka, Kha, Ga, Gha, Nga.

701
01:40:24,360 --> 01:40:26,954
Ka, Kha, Ga, Gha, Nga.

702
01:40:27,080 --> 01:40:29,514
Cha, Chcha, Ja, Jha, Nja.

703
01:40:29,640 --> 01:40:31,756
Tta, Ttha, Dta, Dtha, Nna.

704
01:40:31,880 --> 01:40:34,235
Ta, Tha, Da, Dha, Na.

705
01:40:34,360 --> 01:40:36,510
Pa, Pha, Ba, Bha, Ma.

706
01:40:36,640 --> 01:40:38,153
- Ya.
- Ra.

707
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:39,429
- La.
- Va.

708
01:40:39,560 --> 01:40:40,629
- Sa.
- Sha.

709
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:42,193
- Sa.
- Haa!!

710
01:40:56,160 --> 01:40:59,755
Then the demon said,
"Wait, wait...

711
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:03,634
"You don't think about
the consequences. You are rash.

712
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:06,869
"You foolish Prince...

713
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:08,956
"I'll give you one more chance.

714
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:13,390
"If you dote so much
on your son,

715
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:16,080
"I'll spare him, all right?

716
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:20,157
"Instead,
give up your wife to me.

717
01:41:21,080 --> 01:41:25,676
"It's been a long time
since I had a pretty lady for my meal.

718
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:28,712
"And don't grieve over her...

719
01:41:28,840 --> 01:41:31,593
"You can take another beauty
for your wife."

720
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:37,389
The prince rushed forth in anger,
"You wicked demon!"

721
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:41,312
The demon said,
"Hold on...

722
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:46,309
"In this combat,
victory will be mine.

723
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:53,157
"So, you decide
who I should choose for my meal."

724
01:41:55,120 --> 01:41:58,396
The prince brandished his sword
and leapt forward.

725
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:03,068
"What makes you so sure
you'll always be the victor?"
