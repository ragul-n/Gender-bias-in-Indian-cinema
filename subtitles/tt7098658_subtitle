1
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,530
It's been 46 years now

2
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,250
since the three defense forces
of our country came together

3
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:48,290
and won a war against Pakistan,
in 1971.

4
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,690
And severed a part
of Pakistan away from it.

5
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,770
Those senior officers
who have witnessed that war

6
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:00,330
can never forget the
sacrifices of that time.

7
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,090
Not just the ones
who fought the war...

8
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:08,810
...but even those who were
miles away from the front...

9
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,530
...helping our forces.

10
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:17,970
The brave agents
of our Intelligence Bureau.

11
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:22,410
Their glorious feats
are still fresh in my mind.

12
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:27,610
Among them, was a 20-year-old girl...

13
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,170
...who crossed all imaginable limits!

14
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:39,170
The struggle for liberation
is gaining momentum in East Pakistan.

15
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,410
The leader of their secret
army is this man.

16
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,810
Colonel Usmani.

17
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,530
What are their intentions?

18
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:52,890
Mujib-ur-Rehman has managed
to gather a group of people

19
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,090
who now call themselves
the 'Mukti' Army.

20
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,970
'Mukti' meaning Freedom!

21
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,130
And this man is...

22
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,330
Khalid Mir.

23
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,530
We need to keep
a strict vigilance on him.

24
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,650
He's a high-ranking officer
in the Indian Intelligence Bureau.

25
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,170
Can I get you something, Sir?

26
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,610
Brigadier Sir will be out soon.

27
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:45,410
My dear friend!

28
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,970
Welcome.

29
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,330
Thank you.

30
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,290
Hidayat...

31
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:03,770
Your last information on
our rogue officer Rusul Amin

32
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,130
was absolutely correct.

33
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,890
That traitor has quit
the Pakistani Navy

34
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,330
and joined the 'Mukti Army'.

35
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:15,770
Get me some more information
from your informer.

36
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,370
What kind of information?

37
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,010
India is helping Mujib-ur-Rehman

38
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,090
to fulfill his dreams of liberation.

39
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,730
We need to know
what they are planning.

40
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,290
If India tries to interfere
in our internal matters...

41
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,170
...they will pay dearly
for their interference.

42
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,730
I'm going back to Kashmir today.

43
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,210
I'll try to find out all I can,
as soon as I get back.

44
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,610
May God bless you with success.

45
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,010
And may your brotherhood
with Pakistan always remain!

46
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,170
Always, brother Syed... always!

47
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,850
Now, if there's anything
I can do for you...

48
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,090
Syed...
- Yes...

49
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,450
I have a small wish...

50
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:14,010
which could be a request as well.
- Yes.

51
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,010
The thing is...

52
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:24,770
there is a tumor in my lung.

53
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,410
I have never smoked a cigarette.

54
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,170
Maybe I got too high on life.

55
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,370
Hidayat...

56
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,930
I am no doctor...

57
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,090
But, if as a friend
I could be of any help,

58
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:50,750
please let me know.

59
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,250
I don't know what to say, Hidayat.

60
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:38,790
I can't fathom what
you have just said.

61
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,090
Spying for India...

62
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:49,410
...and maintaining contacts
in Pakistan is one thing.

63
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:53,610
But an innocent girl, who
knows nothing about spying...

64
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,650
She's your daughter, Hidayat.

65
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:59,850
She is an Indian first.

66
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,850
You don't know how crucial
this time is for India.

67
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,370
And how dangerous it can get.

68
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:12,970
They have got a whiff
of India's involvement in Bengal.

69
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,290
And they will not tolerate it.

70
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,810
They will never let
Pakistan break apart.

71
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:23,370
They are hatching
a big scheme against us.

72
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,090
What kind of scheme?

73
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,850
Mir Sahab, if I knew that...

74
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,770
...would I risk my daughter's life?

75
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,930
They have a lot of faith in me...

76
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,890
...which they can only have
in my daughter, after me.

77
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,250
But, Hidayat...

78
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,490
I hope you will stay for lunch?

79
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:45,850
Not today...

80
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,930
There is an urgent
Bureau meeting in Delhi.

81
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:48,810
I will be leaving soon.

82
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,090
Then I'll send some dry-fruits.

83
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,170
Make sure he eats.

84
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,170
The strongest intentions
fall weak on an empty stomach.

85
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,770
What does Teji think?

86
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,090
She thinks you should
have lunch with us.

87
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,090
And did you ask Sehmat?

88
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,850
Did my father ask me?

89
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,250
He simply informed me.

90
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,450
And taught me.
- Have you told your daughter...

91
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,930
...about the future you
are planning for her?

92
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,410
I will...

93
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:42,330
I will tell her,
and you will teach her.

94
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:46,410
If you give her a chance,
you will see for yourself.

95
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,810
What I cannot accomplish, Sehmat will!

96
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,610
Sehmat!

97
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,490
What were you thinking, idiot?

98
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:35,970
About the squirrel...

99
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,160
What happened?

100
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:48,130
You take it out! Just looking
at the blood is making me dizzy.

101
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,610
Sissy!

102
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,130
Careful.

103
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,810
Mind the steps. Careful.

104
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,810
I think you should
take a tetanus shot.

105
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:57,930
Injection?
- Yes...

106
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,170
No, please!.

107
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:02,330
It'll hurt a lot less than
that shard of glass.

108
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,730
Dr. Kapoor must be in his clinic now.

109
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,130
Let me see.

110
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,090
151874...

111
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,650
Don't you know?

112
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:15,770
She's is our college's
telephone directory.

113
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,930
Once she sees a number or dials it,

114
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,490
she never forgets.

115
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,450
Ms. Sehmat Khan.

116
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,730
There is a call from
your father in the office.

117
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,330
Abbu has called?

118
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,290
Thank God!

119
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,690
You look absolutely fine.

120
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:48,090
Now once I see mother,
I'll be completely relieved!

121
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,930
How did you get hurt?
- It's nothing.

122
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,610
Did you fall down?

123
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:00,010
Your 'urgency' really scared me Abbu.

124
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,970
I'm serving lunch...

125
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,250
Do we have any Loquat mother?

126
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,610
This is not the season
for Loquat, dear.

127
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,250
I've made some almond
sherbet instead.

128
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,850
Is everything alright?

129
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,650
Yes.

130
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,170
Come, let's eat.

131
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,970
No Abbu, first tell me...

132
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,650
My business requires me
to make trips to Pakistan.

133
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:29,750
And in that, the work that I do
for our Intelligence Bureau,

134
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,610
you know about...

135
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,970
During my last trip
to the other side

136
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,410
I became aware of
a grave threat to India.

137
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,650
War? Again?

138
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,930
The winds of war
are blowing in Bengal.

139
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,650
And in order to prevent
India from interfering,

140
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:51,290
Pakistan wants to do something

141
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,090
that will cripple India.

142
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:56,210
What can they do?

143
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,770
I don't know.

144
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:03,650
This entire situation
is a matter of a few months.

145
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:08,410
And I don't have
a few months left...

146
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,410
Mother...

147
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,330
He told me last night...

148
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,650
...what he's known
for four months.

149
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:37,170
There is a tumor
in his lung

150
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,810
and it is growing.

151
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:43,330
Why didn't you tell me, Abbu?

152
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:45,930
I would have come sooner.

153
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,810
That's why I have called you now.

154
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,130
No...

155
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,010
That's not why you've called her.

156
00:12:55,690 --> 00:13:02,010
We need to be prepared
for any emergency...

157
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,690
I want you to take my place.

158
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,770
I want you to be the
eyes and ears for India

159
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,130
and live in Pakistan.

160
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,690
How?

161
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:17,370
Tell her that too.

162
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,690
I'm telling her, Teji.

163
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,370
I'm telling her everything.

164
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:30,770
Brigadier Syed is an
acquaintance of mine in Pakistan.

165
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:35,850
And I couldn't think
of a better way

166
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,210
of placing you there.

167
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:45,850
I have proposed your marriage

168
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,930
to his youngest son, Iqbal.

169
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,160
The Bureau has given the go-ahead.

170
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,850
Now it is up to us.

171
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,090
I want you to go back
to college tomorrow dear.

172
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,490
I don't know what I was thinking.

173
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,710
How could I even think about
putting you in such grave danger?

174
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:39,010
Why do you risk your own
life for the country, Abbu?

175
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,730
That is my father's legacy.

176
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:50,090
I did... as I was told.

177
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:53,330
But to make you do the same...

178
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,210
...is a mistake.

179
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,330
So...
- Alright, Abbu.

180
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,330
I'll go back to college, as you say.

181
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:08,450
But my father too, has
raised me with the same belief.

182
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,970
That nothing comes
before the country.

183
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,490
Not even yourself.

184
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,010
And if that is a mistake...

185
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:23,530
...then enrolling your sons in
the army to protect the nation...

186
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,170
...is also a mistake.

187
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:47,010
The path of life is twisted

188
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:54,170
Fate, wickedly entwined

189
00:15:55,330 --> 00:16:02,250
Take hold of your intent

190
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:09,210
The way ahead is clear
If the heart is inclined.

191
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,410
The setup will be ready in 2 days...

192
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:13,090
...and we will begin your training.

193
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:15,290
Only we know the real reason why

194
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,970
you are being married
away to Pakistan.

195
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:22,690
So come up with a good story
to explain to your friends.

196
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:33,210
If the heart is inclined.

197
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,210
Good morning.

198
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:42,930
It's okay.

199
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,250
This is Nikhil Bakshi.

200
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,490
He will be with you
throughout your training.

201
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,890
And this is Sehmat Khan.

202
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,090
You need to know some important
instructions before your training begins.

203
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,730
First and foremost,
as a field agent,

204
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,370
there will be a line
drawn around you.

205
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:03,770
All your actions
will be within that line.

206
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,850
And you will never take
any action of your own will.

207
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:08,910
Any information that
you come across,

208
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:10,890
simply pass on to us.

209
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,210
And keep your eyes and ears open...

210
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,130
at all times.

211
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,290
Clear?

212
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,210
If you ever feel

213
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,690
that your cover is
about to be blown...

214
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:28,730
...it most probably already is.

215
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,380
Trust your instincts and inform us.

216
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,210
We'll clear a way to extract
you out of there immediately.

217
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,170
You don't think I will
be able to do this...

218
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:40,730
...right?

219
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,410
I can't say right now.

220
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:44,490
Start your training...

221
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,170
...then ask me this question
after about a month.

222
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:49,970
I'll answer you then.

223
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,170
This is Espionage.

224
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,410
And Surveillance.

225
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,130
It is done in many ways.

226
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,730
One is Physical...

227
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,970
Keeping a watch on someone...

228
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,130
from a distance...

229
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,090
In remote surveillance,
the distance increases.

230
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,210
So instead of our eyes,
we use our ears.

231
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,490
Bugs.

232
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,250
But in every situation,

233
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:26,530
we need to stay alert.

234
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,170
Like I was saying...

235
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,970
Always alert!

236
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,650
Meaning two eyes in the front...

237
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,850
...two over your shoulders...

238
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,160
...and one here,

239
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,730
at the back of your head.

240
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,210
...must always be open.

241
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,440
We will contact you only
when you give us a signal...

242
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,550
...and not otherwise.

243
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,960
And direct communication,
phone calls... never.

244
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,590
Those can get detected.

245
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,950
Whatever information is passed on...

246
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,470
...will be only through Morse Code.

247
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,230
Once you've installed the unit...

248
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:04,590
...send us a test message
so that we know.

249
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:12,470
You must memorize each
symbol of each alphabet.

250
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,150
Wait.

251
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,470
Short tap for the dot.

252
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,830
Longer tap for the dash.

253
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,990
And rest your hand on the table.

254
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,870
Wrong.

255
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:40,150
These are the code
names for your in-laws.

256
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,310
Brigadier Syed:

257
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,270
The Eagle.

258
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,030
Major Mehboob Syed:

259
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:49,230
The Cat.

260
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:50,830
His wife Munira:

261
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,470
The Mouse.

262
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,750
And...

263
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:09,550
Your dedication, at stake...

264
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,310
Your wounds, ripe...

265
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,270
Throw your heart in the game

266
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:23,430
If the heart is inclined.

267
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:29,340
Your dedication, at stake...

268
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,830
Your wounds, ripe...

269
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:34,470
Throw your heart in the game

270
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:38,230
If the heart is inclined.

271
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:42,590
Was that alright?

272
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,190
No matter what is
happening with you...

273
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:52,090
...the smile of a new bride
must always be on your face.

274
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:01,070
Too much smiling
makes the cheeks hurt.

275
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:13,590
There are many things
that you may not have to do...

276
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,110
Yet, it is important
that you learn them.

277
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,870
Left hand goes here.

278
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:27,710
Shoulders down.

279
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:30,030
Throw your heart in the game

280
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:40,070
If the heart is inclined.

281
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,350
Take a good look
and remember his name.

282
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,510
Kabir Murtaza...

283
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,470
And his wife, Pallavi.

284
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,270
He is our First Secretary
in Rawalpindi.

285
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,030
And your prime contact as well.

286
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,430
But, like I said...

287
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,030
never directly.

288
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,990
Unless it's an emergency.

289
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:00,670
You will call on the
switchboard number...

290
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,430
...wait for two rings and hang up.

291
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,870
You will be contacted
from a secure line.

292
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,750
Ricin.

293
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,030
A kind of poison.

294
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,950
In case you are ever in a situation...

295
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,830
...where you need to get
someone out of the way.

296
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,550
This will be useful.

297
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:18,950
It causes a heart attack...
- Get someone out of the way?

298
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,430
You mean, kill them?

299
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:24,510
Is there a problem?
- Shouldn't there be?

300
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,470
I was wearing headphones!

301
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,830
Headphones only cancel
out sound, not your sight.

302
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:49,670
Keep your eyes open.
- I am trying!

303
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,990
I can't make miracles
happen in just a week!

304
00:22:56,230 --> 00:23:00,150
How heartless are you!
- So heartless that I know...

305
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:02,350
...that if you fail to
perform this miracle...

306
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,950
...you alone will
face the consequences.

307
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,550
Not me... not Nikhil...
not Hidayat...

308
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:09,030
Just you!

309
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:18,860
One mistake...

310
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,780
One error...

311
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,580
...and your corpse
will be lying on the floor.

312
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,220
Start this round
from the middle target.

313
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,020
'Inland Trunk Booking'

314
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,140
Hello.

315
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,580
I want to book an
urgent call to Srinagar.

316
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,860
Number, please.

317
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,340
Not now...

318
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,020
These phone numbers will
not be written anywhere.

319
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:12,660
Etch them in your memory.

320
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:15,900
There can be no mistakes
with names and numbers.

321
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,180
Take as much time as you need

322
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:19,590
to memorise them.

323
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:20,980
The entire day today is for...
- Ready!

324
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,540
Delhi Bureau.
- 138579.

325
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,780
Switch Board Number.
- 56829.

326
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,140
Code?
- Country: 92, City: 51.

327
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,180
Have you seen this list before?

328
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,500
That's impossible sir.

329
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,900
I have just made it.

330
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,340
Sarvar.
- 56372.

331
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,900
The heart will lead you

332
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,940
To the extent of your limits

333
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,100
Dedication takes lives,

334
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,580
there, at our edges.

335
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:07,500
Dedication takes lives,
there, at our edges.

336
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:10,100
The future is uncertain

337
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:12,580
The past already inscribed

338
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:15,100
Throw your heart in the game

339
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,500
If the heart is inclined

340
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,740
Throw your heart in the game

341
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,260
If the heart...

342
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,140
If the heart...

343
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,660
If the heart is inclined...

344
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,580
27 seconds...

345
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,340
In spite of all the instructions...

346
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,340
...you must learn
to depend on yourself.

347
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,380
Trust your gut...

348
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,560
Your instincts will guide you.

349
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,500
May I ask you a question again?

350
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:34,540
Do you think
I will be able do this?

351
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:37,900
I am certain of it.

352
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,140
Can I ask you a question?

353
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:50,140
Why did you agree to do this?

354
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,140
You were studying in college.

355
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,420
You must have had some
plans for your future.

356
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,780
your own dreams...

357
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:05,860
My father and his father...

358
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,150
who fought in our freedom struggle...

359
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,220
I had asked him once...

360
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:17,180
Why did you take those beatings?

361
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,580
Spend all those months in jail?

362
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,620
He replied with a smile...

363
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,940
There is no ME before the nation.

364
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,620
I am the nation.

365
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,580
I am India.

366
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:44,980
His blood runs through my veins too...

367
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,780
I am my father's beloved

368
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:58,620
but bid me farewell
now dear brother...

369
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:02,540
I am my father's beloved

370
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:08,100
but bid me farewell
now dear brother...

371
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:12,740
I am my father's beloved...

372
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:26,340
You held my hand

373
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,880
As I took my first steps

374
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:31,320
This threshold is high

375
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,460
Help me cross over

376
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:37,180
I am your Princess dear Father.

377
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,780
The core of your heart

378
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:43,740
Across this threshold again,
help me cross over...

379
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:49,100
Don't look back dear girl...

380
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:55,220
Dear one... Don't look back...

381
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,940
Don't look back dear girl...

382
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:05,340
Dear one... Don't look back...

383
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:21,020
Fields once uprooted

384
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,540
cannot be reaped again

385
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:26,340
Daughters once married

386
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:29,340
don't turn back again

387
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,060
Fields once uprooted

388
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,660
cannot be reaped again

389
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,420
Daughters once married

390
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,500
don't turn back again

391
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:47,060
If this is farewell

392
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:49,780
If this is where we part

393
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,140
This threshold of pain,

394
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,980
Help me over it again...

395
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,900
I am your Princess dear Father

396
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,700
The core of your heart

397
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:06,100
Across this threshold again,
help me cross over

398
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:18,820
My dear girl!

399
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:24,700
The frozen hills will melt again

400
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:31,110
My dear girl!

401
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:36,780
The barren fields will ripen again

402
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:42,540
My prayers will follow...

403
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:46,620
...each step you take...

404
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:50,500
My prayers will follow you...

405
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:53,260
I am your Princess dear Father

406
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,980
The core of your heart

407
00:30:56,130 --> 00:31:00,700
Across this threshold again,
help me cross over

408
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,340
Don't look back dear girl...

409
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:11,020
Dear one... Don't look back...

410
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:16,220
Don't look back dear girl...

411
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:22,420
Dear one... Don't look back...

412
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:26,060
Sorry.

413
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,460
Please wait.

414
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,540
Welcome!

415
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,380
Wasim

416
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,540
Ismail

417
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,340
And Abdul...

418
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:01,260
He's the oldest member
of our staff.

419
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:03,340
He has practically raised Iqbal.

420
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,260
Congratulations, Sir.

421
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:08,740
Come.

422
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:14,980
Sehmat...

423
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:18,860
Your new home, your new family...

424
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,800
...and your new country Pakistan,
welcomes you.

425
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,040
May Allah bless you.

426
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,600
Iqbal.
- Yes.

427
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,400
Take her upstairs please.

428
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,000
Go on my child.

429
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,960
Where are you going?

430
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,400
I'll be right here on the sofa.

431
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:02,400
I'll close this door,
for your privacy.

432
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:06,760
I know our fathers
made this match...

433
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:11,280
...but, we must get to know
each other, for ourselves.

434
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,720
You will need time...

435
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:16,200
...and so will I.

436
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,320
Could you leave it a little open?

437
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,300
I hope you don't mind.

438
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,400
No... I don't.

439
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,160
Please let it be,
madam... I'll do it.

440
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,040
Go set the table, Salma.
Breakfast will be ready by then.

441
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:58,960
Okay.

442
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,680
Excuse me Madam...

443
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,560
What are you doing
here in the kitchen?

444
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,040
You don't have to take the trouble.

445
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,520
It's no trouble at all Uncle...

446
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,760
I woke up early...

447
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,520
...So I thought I'll
make the breakfast.

448
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:14,040
I have made parathas
and tea for everyone.

449
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:17,400
But do you even know when
everyone sits down for breakfast?

450
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,120
And what all they like to eat?

451
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,040
First of all, everyone
has breakfast together.

452
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:28,160
And they all prefer
to have toast.

453
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:30,400
Oh...

454
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:34,160
So we'll have the parathas
for lunch then.

455
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:36,320
You should taste them too Uncle.
I make them quite well...

456
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,400
You don't need to bother
with the cooking.

457
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,400
Munira madam decides what
is to be made each morning.

458
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,480
Both lunch and dinner
are prepared accordingly.

459
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,360
Unless you have taken over
the household responsibilities...

460
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,800
I'm sorry...

461
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,800
I interfered in the kitchen...

462
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,080
...without permission.

463
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,120
Abdul... Toast.
- Coming.

464
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:07,520
'Don't be in a hurry to
win their affection.'

465
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,920
'It doesn't work...'

466
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,200
'And looks like false flattery.'

467
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,280
'Give it a few weeks...'

468
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:15,520
'...everything will fall into place.'

469
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,510
I heard what happened
in the kitchen today.

470
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,870
I was only trying to be helpful.

471
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,840
I didn't mean to
interfere with his work.

472
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,390
There was no interference!

473
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,790
Abdul is a little too
possessive about this family.

474
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:15,830
But you're the daughter-in-law
of the family after all.

475
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:19,710
When you first came,
was he like this with you too?

476
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:23,310
Somewhat.

477
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:27,310
But maybe because...
- I am Indian?

478
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,390
Is that why?

479
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:31,150
Could be...

480
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,830
But, he is an Indian himself...

481
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:36,230
...he moved to Pakistan
only after the Partition.

482
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,430
Please sit.

483
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,430
'Make a note of everyone's
arrival and departure...'

484
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:50,270
'Where they go... where
they have their meetings...'

485
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:21,390
You only listen to Jazz music?

486
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:26,830
I like Western Classical too.

487
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:31,310
But Jazz has a completely
different effect on me.

488
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:32,550
I know!

489
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:35,630
Just like Indian
classical music has...

490
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,950
...on me.

491
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,310
You have grown up in India...

492
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:44,190
...it's natural that you
will like things from there.

493
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,110
The action at Dhaka University...

494
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:15,920
Watch the ways of the wind

495
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:20,630
Tread lightly in your gait

496
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:26,830
Your footprints betray you

497
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:32,060
Your conscience up in flames

498
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:38,790
Watch the ways of the wind

499
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:41,270
Tread lightly in your gait

500
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:43,830
Your footprints betray you

501
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:46,350
Your conscience up in flames

502
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:48,780
Your conscience up in flames

503
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:01,270
Sorry!

504
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,890
The door wasn't locked...

505
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,270
'Sarvar.'

506
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:18,430
Owns a grocery store
in the main market.

507
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,590
If anything goes wrong,
contact him immediately.

508
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,990
The Bride is smiling.

509
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:18,990
Sir, Sehmat's test message.

510
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,470
The cheeks are hurting.

511
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:31,150
What are you doing?!

512
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,510
I'm sorry...

513
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:40,270
Abba...

514
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:44,190
You could at least speak
with Lt. General Beig.

515
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:45,910
Beig has already made up his mind.

516
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,630
He's calling Farooqi to Islamabad.

517
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,430
Both your names are still being
considered for the promotion Abba...

518
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:54,790
Perhaps Farooqi will say no.

519
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,430
Farooqi isn't stupid.

520
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,270
Only a fool will
refuse a promotion...

521
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:01,110
...in the Pakistani Armed forces.

522
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:14,670
Wait here. I'll
be back in an hour.

523
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:15,750
Alright madam.

524
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:46,990
The rickshaw-puller is Imtiaz.

525
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,750
He is connected to Sarvar.

526
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:55,190
Yes...

527
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:57,540
I need some sunflowers...

528
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:59,150
...for a party.

529
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:00,430
Come...

530
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:15,590
Sadiq.

531
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:17,850
...owns a flower shop
outside the mosque.

532
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,190
I'm giving the phone to her.

533
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:28,350
Can we talk?
- Yes.

534
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,750
This line is secure.

535
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:32,540
The promotion that the
Brigadier was expecting...

536
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:33,840
...is still tentative.

537
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:35,350
It's possible, it may not happen.

538
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,150
So?

539
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:39,510
Ask South to send a
few gifts for the in-laws.

540
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,190
Beautiful!

541
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:50,380
Your father is spoiling me as well!

542
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:54,510
Abba is home.

543
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:56,590
These are for him.

544
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:02,630
Should we inform
Abbu that you like it?

545
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:40,110
The location of the Mukti Army
training camp was spot on, Syed.

546
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:45,350
Next time, we'll get them
before they can escape.

547
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,070
Wonderful!

548
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:50,990
Your sources are truly remarkable.

549
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,750
Thank you, Sir.

550
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:10,990
This is Mr. Kabir Murtaza,
from the Indian Embassy.

551
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:13,630
And his wife, Pallavi.

552
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:17,830
Sehmat, this is Col. Siddiqui...

553
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,310
A dear friend of the family.

554
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:21,390
And this is Suraiya Begum.

555
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:23,430
It was my honour Sir...

556
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:25,150
Good evening...

557
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:27,910
I hope the fish was to
your liking Beig Sahab...

558
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:29,950
Of course. I loved it!

559
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:33,240
And, I didn't have to
worry about the bones either.

560
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,310
The entire credit goes to her Sir.

561
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:38,950
Well then... India has finally
done something right!

562
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:43,110
It is all because
of our dear father...

563
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:44,350
His instructions were clear...

564
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:47,230
...that I leave no dearth
in your hospitality.

565
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:49,470
I feel very privileged!

566
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:34,910
I thought you'd said
she's not experienced...

567
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:37,350
She never even blinked an eye.

568
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:38,870
She is not an expert agent...

569
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:42,110
...but she was a good student.

570
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:44,270
You should know that the Brigadier

571
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:46,150
has now been promoted
to Major General.

572
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:50,670
Okay Kabir, all good so far.

573
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:02,430
It's late Abba...
you should rest now.

574
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:14,950
Lock the doors

575
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:17,150
and bring me the keys dear.
- Yes

576
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:05,510
Thank you.

577
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:15,750
No!

578
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:19,190
Tell her to be extremely
cautious, Kabir.

579
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:22,030
She has to be very careful.

580
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:29,950
Is everything okay, sir?

581
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:33,710
Lt. General Beig has returned
from his field exercises.

582
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:39,270
The meetings that were
taking place at Syed's home...

583
00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:40,670
...will now be held at Beig's house.

584
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:41,910
Sir, then how will Sehmat...

585
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:44,990
She has managed to convince Kabir

586
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:48,670
that she will extract the
information from Beig's home.

587
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:50,990
She is crossing her limits.

588
00:49:56,110 --> 00:49:57,150
Yes.

589
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,270
I'm very sorry.

590
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:03,270
I now understand his pride in you.

591
00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:16,030
I'm going back with Iqbal tomorrow.

592
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:18,430
You could stay a little longer.

593
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:20,270
There is no time...

594
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:22,390
Don't take too many risks, Sehmat...

595
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:25,470
...because the meetings will
now be held at the General's house.

596
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:28,950
I won't let my father down.

597
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:31,950
I'll leave...

598
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:35,110
...I can't let Iqbal see me.

599
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:47,510
Father regrets your loss, Amma...

600
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:49,750
Unfortunately, he is attanding to

601
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:51,150
some American officers
who are visiting Islamabad.

602
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:52,910
Or he would have been here.

603
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,240
There is something that
once belonged to my mother...

604
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,440
I wanted to gift it to you.

605
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:50,600
And wanted you to know that...

606
00:52:51,290 --> 00:52:52,600
...you are not alone.

607
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:55,840
I'm here for you.

608
00:52:56,170 --> 00:52:57,080
Always.

609
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:09,000
They're beautiful...

610
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:16,160
May I put them on you?

611
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,960
Your eyes look tired...

612
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,800
Get some sleep.

613
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:02,000
I don't want to be alone...

614
00:54:56,930 --> 00:54:58,560
This is fine.
Get these printed.

615
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:02,240
They are teachers
from the Army school.

616
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:05,320
Every year, I help them with
their Annual Day Celebrations.

617
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,880
It is a really tough job...

618
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:08,680
...to involve so many children!

619
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,880
And no one volunteers
to assist with the program.

620
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:11,880
Tell me!

621
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:13,200
How can I be of help?

622
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:15,720
I could teach them a song...

623
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,770
Yes... that would be nice.

624
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:26,400
Only children of Army
families study here?

625
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:27,880
Yes, just the Army.

626
00:55:28,010 --> 00:55:30,120
Right from the junior officers
posted at the cantonment...

627
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,640
...to Lt. General Beig's grandson.

628
00:55:36,910 --> 00:55:39,480
I've picked 15 children.
Will that be enough?

629
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:44,280
Zain Beig?

630
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:46,880
He can't sing.

631
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,120
I could give it a try.

632
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:49,520
Beig Sahab may like it.

633
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:53,360
Anwar Siddiqui...

634
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:54,800
He's a good choice.

635
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:56,680
You've met Colonel Siddiqui,

636
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:58,120
and Suraiya Begum.

637
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,120
He's their grandson.

638
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:02,600
According to your list, you've got
your work cut out for you.

639
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,450
You should start rehearsals
from tomorrow itself.

640
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:06,640
Of course...

641
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:08,760
And if any child
has trouble coping up...

642
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:10,800
...I'll even give
extra lessons at home.

643
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:12,000
Like you mentioned...

644
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:13,240
Zain Beig...

645
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,740
My country.. my motherland...

646
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:18,320
Forever may you bloom...

647
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,680
Wherever in the world I roam

648
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,920
You will always remain home!

649
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,360
Wherever in the world I roam

650
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,560
You will always remain home!

651
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:31,560
My country... my motherland...!

652
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:36,680
My country... my motherland...!

653
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:38,520
Did you all like the song?

654
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:40,120
Yes!

655
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,980
And would you like to sing
this song on your Annual day?

656
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:43,220
Yes!

657
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:44,920
My name is Sehmat Syed.

658
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:46,940
Now introduce yourselves to me.

659
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:48,540
Anwar Siddiqui.

660
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:50,140
Bilal Durani.

661
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:51,620
Mariam Qazi.

662
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:53,620
Zain Beig.

663
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:56,340
Ghazal Javed.

664
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:06,540
You are my purpose,
my very being is you...

665
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:11,140
You are my purpose,
my very being is you...

666
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:15,740
Wherever I may reach,
my reason remains you...

667
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:20,580
Wherever I may reach,
my reason remains you...

668
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:24,460
My country... my motherland...!

669
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:26,900
My country... my motherland...!

670
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:29,660
Forever may you bloom...

671
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:32,020
Wherever in the world I roam

672
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:34,300
You will always remain home!

673
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:38,380
My country... my motherland...!

674
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:26,940
Very good, Zain.

675
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:28,860
That's all for today.

676
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:03,540
Mother!

677
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:06,700
Mother, may I take two?

678
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:08,660
No Zain, don't be greedy.

679
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:10,220
Take just one toffee.

680
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:15,860
Pardon me, but Zain said
that the washroom was this way.

681
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:17,660
I thought it was here.

682
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,900
How can you be sure about this, Mir?

683
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:40,340
On one hand, you claim that

684
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:42,540
your agent couldn't make sense
of the maps and drawings.

685
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:45,220
And you still insist that
this information is valid.

686
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:46,500
It is, sir.

687
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:48,300
She couldn't understand
the nautical maps...

688
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:50,100
...because she's not
an experienced operative.

689
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:53,140
But she is confident that
those images were of a submarine.

690
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:57,060
Gentlemen, Pakistan wouldn't
have maps of our oceans

691
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:58,900
in their files
without any reason.

692
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:03,460
Especially if you consider the
current scenario in East Pakistan.

693
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:06,220
And under these circumstances,
marine action by Pakistan

694
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:07,500
is entirely possible.

695
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:09,500
I hope we are not caught off guard

696
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:11,700
in spite of having all the
information at our disposal.

697
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:20,890
I will meet each peril
before it touches you...

698
01:00:20,970 --> 01:00:25,140
I will meet each peril
before it touches you...

699
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:29,720
My life at stake forever,
always to protect you...

700
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:34,500
My life at stake forever,
always to protect you...

701
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:36,300
My country.. my motherland...

702
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:39,140
Forever may you bloom...

703
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:41,340
Wherever in the world I roam

704
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:43,660
You will always remain home!

705
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:47,660
My country... my motherland...!

706
01:00:48,450 --> 01:00:52,220
My country... my motherland...!

707
01:00:54,510 --> 01:01:04,220
From the heart to my lips
My wish rises like a prayer

708
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:15,620
Like your eternal flame, oh Lord!
May my life spread light forever...

709
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:28,700
Like your eternal flame, oh Lord!
May my life spread light forever...

710
01:01:29,540 --> 01:01:34,020
My country... my motherland...!

711
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:40,340
My country... my motherland...!

712
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,620
At the Annual Day function...

713
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:57,300
...I could see shades
of your father in you.

714
01:01:57,540 --> 01:02:00,460
The same hard work...
the same spirit...

715
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:04,460
Sir...

716
01:02:04,610 --> 01:02:06,060
This has just come
from Beig sahab...

717
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:07,340
It needs your signature.

718
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:08,620
Keep it in my study.

719
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:09,820
Alright.

720
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:18,960
Our neighbors are now
helping the Mukti Army...

721
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:21,220
...to build their own Air force.

722
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:25,980
The Indian Air force is training
our renegade pilots.

723
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:28,540
Be prepared, son...

724
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:32,460
Our situation with India
is going to become quite hostile.

725
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:35,540
We're prepared, father...

726
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:37,500
And waiting.

727
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:39,380
This is not the 1965 war.

728
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:42,620
This time there's no
chance of a compromise.

729
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:45,420
They will be scanning the skies...

730
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:47,740
...and we'll sweep the ground
from under their feet.

731
01:02:57,370 --> 01:02:59,540
I know Abba's words can be painful.

732
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:03,300
Sorry, Sehmat.

733
01:03:04,830 --> 01:03:08,740
My family often forgets
that India is your motherland.

734
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:13,940
My home is now where my family is.

735
01:03:29,380 --> 01:03:30,940
Yes.
- Sir...

736
01:03:32,770 --> 01:03:35,500
Syed Sahab wants you and
Mehboob to get ready.

737
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:37,660
You are to leave for
an important meeting.

738
01:04:57,620 --> 01:05:00,020
Abdul... Sir's file got
left in the study.

739
01:05:00,220 --> 01:05:01,580
Yes, I had kept it.

740
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:02,980
I'll get it.

741
01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:38,140
Did you find the file, Abdul?

742
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:43,180
Abdul!

743
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:46,740
Wait, let me look in Mehboob's room.

744
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:03,500
What's going on?

745
01:06:03,820 --> 01:06:05,060
Where is the file?

746
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:07,580
This one Father?
- Yes.

747
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:09,540
Thank you dear...

748
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:28,140
I never really trusted you!

749
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:16,740
Give me everything.

750
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:18,300
Everything she's sent
is on the board?

751
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:20,340
Sir, Sehmat has sent us this message.

752
01:07:20,530 --> 01:07:21,820
The last transmission
has just come in.

753
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:23,020
Which key are we using?

754
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:25,060
1233122311.

755
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:34,540
7...

756
01:07:35,580 --> 01:07:36,860
5...

757
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:39,220
4...

758
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:52,660
The parcel has been unwrapped.

759
01:09:53,860 --> 01:09:55,180
Everything all right there?

760
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:57,940
The roof...

761
01:09:59,860 --> 01:10:01,380
The roof was leaking...

762
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:05,500
It has been repaired.

763
01:10:08,510 --> 01:10:09,620
All okay...

764
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:28,200
Mehmood?

765
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:37,690
Mehboob!

766
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,800
Echo 754339.

767
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,520
November 61132 Diablo Dolphin...

768
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:52,170
Dolphin... Blue Whale...

769
01:11:53,690 --> 01:11:54,970
Plot these numbers on the map.

770
01:11:55,050 --> 01:11:58,250
Try Echo for East
and November for North.

771
01:12:00,350 --> 01:12:01,730
And vice-versa too.

772
01:12:09,930 --> 01:12:12,210
Get me details of all
Pakistani submarines.

773
01:12:12,530 --> 01:12:13,610
Nikhil?

774
01:12:14,490 --> 01:12:16,410
Sir, these coordinates
point to the Indian Ocean.

775
01:12:17,050 --> 01:12:18,290
And the other coordinates?

776
01:12:18,490 --> 01:12:19,410
Sir.

777
01:12:28,050 --> 01:12:30,050
Diablo is the old
name of PNS Ghazi.

778
01:12:30,610 --> 01:12:33,490
Pakistan is planning
to attack India by sea.

779
01:12:35,450 --> 01:12:37,810
Sir, we don't have latitude
details for the other coordinates.

780
01:12:38,050 --> 01:12:40,610
But the long coordinates
pass through the Bay of Bengal.

781
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:43,610
Where our INS Vikrant is docked.

782
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:47,890
The Blue Whale.

783
01:12:52,050 --> 01:12:53,970
That's what Pakistan is targeting.

784
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:04,050
What is his condition?
- He has suffered multiple fractures.

785
01:13:04,330 --> 01:13:06,210
And also lost a lot of blood.

786
01:13:06,370 --> 01:13:09,130
We're trying our best
to save him, but...

787
01:13:10,490 --> 01:13:12,010
Major Mehboob Syed.

788
01:13:17,370 --> 01:13:18,450
Abdul?

789
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:29,050
Take rest.

790
01:13:29,170 --> 01:13:30,290
Be quiet, Abdul.

791
01:13:31,770 --> 01:13:34,490
Se... eh... ma...

792
01:13:35,650 --> 01:13:36,610
Sehmat.

793
01:13:44,690 --> 01:13:46,370
You were fast asleep
when I returned.

794
01:13:47,670 --> 01:13:49,930
Kept mumbling Abdul's
name in your sleep.

795
01:13:51,170 --> 01:13:53,250
Mehboob is with him in the hospital.

796
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:55,490
He'll let us know if anything happens.

797
01:13:57,610 --> 01:14:01,290
Abdul... he... he is all right?

798
01:14:04,490 --> 01:14:05,810
He will be, God willing.

799
01:14:15,130 --> 01:14:17,490
This information
worries me, gentlemen.

800
01:14:18,170 --> 01:14:21,330
But I am afraid we're still
not paying heed to it.

801
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:23,370
We are Mr. Mir...

802
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:25,290
And taking it seriously too.

803
01:14:25,370 --> 01:14:27,130
Otherwise, we wouldn't
have gathered here.

804
01:14:28,050 --> 01:14:30,730
But... we have another concern.

805
01:14:31,170 --> 01:14:33,050
We haven't received any information

806
01:14:33,170 --> 01:14:35,930
from the Army or Navy intelligence

807
01:14:36,090 --> 01:14:39,170
to corroborate with yours.

808
01:14:39,970 --> 01:14:42,770
From the security point of view,
everything is under control.

809
01:14:43,590 --> 01:14:45,930
But, we don't want
to cause unnecessary panic.

810
01:14:46,730 --> 01:14:48,650
Admiral... Commodore...

811
01:14:49,490 --> 01:14:52,330
My agent has taken a big risk
to get this piece of information.

812
01:14:52,930 --> 01:14:55,890
And I'm sure the other side too, will
keep such information under wraps.

813
01:14:56,930 --> 01:15:01,050
I think we should wait until
this information is verified.

814
01:15:01,610 --> 01:15:03,250
What do you think?
- I agree.

815
01:15:03,330 --> 01:15:06,410
And please don't feel that we're
ignoring your lead Mr. Mir...

816
01:15:06,610 --> 01:15:09,690
Let's see what
other news we get.

817
01:15:14,930 --> 01:15:17,650
I can't understand the
behaviour of these people...

818
01:15:19,170 --> 01:15:20,330
Instead of taking him to a hospital...

819
01:15:20,410 --> 01:15:21,810
...they just left him to die.

820
01:15:24,370 --> 01:15:26,050
People don't have
a conscience anymore.

821
01:15:44,410 --> 01:15:45,770
Mehboob Sir is back.

822
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:53,170
May Allah give him solace.

823
01:15:54,610 --> 01:15:56,290
Any word from the Police?

824
01:15:59,970 --> 01:16:01,290
Nothing yet.

825
01:16:02,890 --> 01:16:04,250
They are still investigating.

826
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:09,010
The nurse gave me this.

827
01:16:10,330 --> 01:16:11,890
It was found clutched in Abdul's hand.

828
01:16:13,290 --> 01:16:14,730
I'll hand it over for examination...

829
01:16:15,050 --> 01:16:16,610
We may get a lead.

830
01:16:17,610 --> 01:16:18,770
Lay out my clothes...

831
01:16:20,490 --> 01:16:22,210
We should leave in an hour.

832
01:16:46,610 --> 01:16:48,050
Shyama...
- Yes, sir.

833
01:16:48,330 --> 01:16:50,330
Call the entire staff.
- Yes.

834
01:16:50,410 --> 01:16:51,610
What's wrong?

835
01:16:52,330 --> 01:16:54,690
At least one of them would know
what happened last night.

836
01:16:55,730 --> 01:16:57,650
And where was Abdul going?

837
01:16:58,650 --> 01:17:00,530
I had gone to the
General's residence...

838
01:17:00,650 --> 01:17:02,330
...to deliver Sir's papers.

839
01:17:02,610 --> 01:17:04,170
Then I went to pray.

840
01:17:06,050 --> 01:17:07,530
Son was unwell...

841
01:17:07,690 --> 01:17:09,970
Salma and I were in our
quarters, tending to him.

842
01:17:11,250 --> 01:17:14,290
I was oiling Munira madam's hair.

843
01:17:14,610 --> 01:17:16,610
I was manning the water pump.

844
01:17:18,210 --> 01:17:21,250
So, none of you saw
Abdul leave the house!

845
01:17:39,010 --> 01:17:41,170
Are you... looking for something?

846
01:17:41,330 --> 01:17:42,610
I don't get it.

847
01:17:44,330 --> 01:17:46,410
He never liked to
get out of the house.

848
01:17:47,490 --> 01:17:48,970
Then where was he
going at that hour?

849
01:17:50,010 --> 01:17:51,730
That too, without
informing anyone?

850
01:17:52,970 --> 01:17:54,530
And where did he get this?

851
01:17:56,130 --> 01:17:58,290
We left with Father
for the meeting...

852
01:17:59,610 --> 01:18:01,690
...then returned
to collect the file.

853
01:18:02,730 --> 01:18:05,330
Rafiq went inside to
get the file from Abdul.

854
01:18:07,650 --> 01:18:08,970
You found the file, didn't you?

855
01:18:10,810 --> 01:18:11,410
Yes...

856
01:18:11,650 --> 01:18:12,890
Was Abdul there then?

857
01:18:16,370 --> 01:18:18,890
Did you notice anything
different about him?

858
01:18:21,290 --> 01:18:22,850
Did you see him leave the house?

859
01:18:29,170 --> 01:18:30,610
Something doesn't fit...

860
01:18:31,610 --> 01:18:34,010
He called for me
at the hospital...

861
01:18:35,490 --> 01:18:37,050
Or, we would have never known.

862
01:18:39,010 --> 01:18:41,250
He was even trying
to tell me something.

863
01:18:42,970 --> 01:18:44,210
Anyway...

864
01:18:45,010 --> 01:18:47,770
I am meeting the soldiers
who took him to the hospital.

865
01:18:48,210 --> 01:18:49,890
Maybe they will shed
more light on this.

866
01:18:59,690 --> 01:19:00,250
Sir...

867
01:19:00,530 --> 01:19:02,770
we've shared all our intel
with the High Command...

868
01:19:03,290 --> 01:19:06,010
...but they still don't have any
information that corroborates with ours.

869
01:19:06,130 --> 01:19:07,290
And they never will.

870
01:19:07,370 --> 01:19:08,610
That's why we exist.

871
01:19:08,810 --> 01:19:09,770
To provide them with
the information...

872
01:19:09,850 --> 01:19:11,250
...that no one else can.

873
01:19:11,930 --> 01:19:13,170
Bloody hell!

874
01:19:16,610 --> 01:19:19,250
Connect me to Kabir Murtaza.
- Connecting, sir.

875
01:19:20,490 --> 01:19:22,930
The line is going blank, sir.
- Try again after some time.

876
01:19:36,610 --> 01:19:38,450
And lead from the soldiers?

877
01:19:39,210 --> 01:19:40,290
No.

878
01:19:41,530 --> 01:19:44,010
They found Abdul lying
wounded on the road.

879
01:19:44,610 --> 01:19:46,290
He had lost a lot of blood.

880
01:19:47,050 --> 01:19:48,930
So they took him to
the hospital immediately.

881
01:19:49,890 --> 01:19:51,770
They didn't notice anything else.

882
01:19:54,010 --> 01:19:57,130
But the Police has
recovered the car which...

883
01:19:57,530 --> 01:19:59,210
...which ran over Abdul.

884
01:20:00,610 --> 01:20:01,690
Give it.

885
01:20:04,250 --> 01:20:05,410
Whose car is it?

886
01:20:05,730 --> 01:20:07,370
It belongs to the cantonment.

887
01:20:08,610 --> 01:20:10,770
They found it parked further
away from the accident site.

888
01:20:11,530 --> 01:20:13,330
The keys were still in the ignition.

889
01:20:13,850 --> 01:20:16,010
It is being dusted for fingerprints.

890
01:20:17,490 --> 01:20:19,370
And that piece of metal
found in his hand...

891
01:20:20,930 --> 01:20:23,810
...the station chief wants me to
hand it over to the Inspection Bureau.

892
01:20:25,370 --> 01:20:27,970
They will be able
to establish its origin.

893
01:20:33,930 --> 01:20:35,290
Are you okay?

894
01:20:36,370 --> 01:20:38,850
You too seem shaken
up by Abdul's death.

895
01:20:43,610 --> 01:20:45,290
He was very loyal.

896
01:20:47,890 --> 01:20:51,850
And I know he would never
do anything to harm our family.

897
01:20:57,850 --> 01:21:01,130
Should I... go to
the mosque tomorrow?

898
01:21:02,490 --> 01:21:04,850
To offer prayers for Abdul?

899
01:21:05,930 --> 01:21:08,810
I'll also buy some clothes
to donate to the poor...

900
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:10,530
...from the Main Market.

901
01:21:12,770 --> 01:21:14,130
That's a nice gesture.

902
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:16,610
I'll go with you.

903
01:21:22,890 --> 01:21:24,130
You two come with
me to the Head office...

904
01:21:24,210 --> 01:21:26,050
...I'll brief you on the way.
- Abba.

905
01:21:27,210 --> 01:21:28,250
You and Iqbal go ahead.

906
01:21:28,530 --> 01:21:29,810
I have to visit
the station office.

907
01:21:30,610 --> 01:21:32,450
And then go to the
Inspection Bureau...

908
01:21:32,530 --> 01:21:33,410
...where at 12 o'clock I...

909
01:21:33,490 --> 01:21:35,170
The Governor of East Pakistan
has been murdered...

910
01:21:35,250 --> 01:21:37,410
by those back-stabbing
Mukti Army rogues...

911
01:21:37,890 --> 01:21:40,330
And you're busy chasing after
your tail like a mongrel!

912
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:44,050
Stop obsessing over Abdul's death...

913
01:21:44,610 --> 01:21:47,370
...and focus on the tension
that is brewing in the country!

914
01:21:48,210 --> 01:21:49,730
Central Command has
issued the orders...

915
01:21:50,250 --> 01:21:51,890
The regiments there need
to be strengthened.

916
01:21:52,290 --> 01:21:55,010
Forgive me, Abba...
I know I am at fault.

917
01:21:55,810 --> 01:21:58,490
But I cannot get over Abdul's demise.

918
01:21:58,850 --> 01:22:00,010
There's definitely more
than meets the eye...

919
01:22:00,370 --> 01:22:02,730
And I just want to
get to the bottom of it.

920
01:22:03,050 --> 01:22:04,610
I will be at the Head Office soon.

921
01:22:05,290 --> 01:22:06,410
I promise.

922
01:22:22,970 --> 01:22:25,530
Chasing after my tail
like a mongrel...

923
01:22:26,450 --> 01:22:27,330
I've been up all night...

924
01:22:27,810 --> 01:22:31,530
...trying to figure out what
Abdul was trying to tell me.

925
01:22:33,410 --> 01:22:34,690
For a minute it even seemed like...

926
01:22:34,770 --> 01:22:36,650
...Abdul was trying
to take your name too.

927
01:22:40,690 --> 01:22:41,970
It's uncanny...

928
01:23:02,810 --> 01:23:04,010
Died.

929
01:23:04,610 --> 01:23:05,970
Like they say in English...

930
01:23:06,050 --> 01:23:07,370
The phone is dead.

931
01:23:07,810 --> 01:23:08,850
It's very urgent.

932
01:23:08,930 --> 01:23:11,170
I understand, but...
- Mister, I want a bunch of these flowers.

933
01:23:11,370 --> 01:23:13,050
And, how much for the roses?

934
01:23:24,610 --> 01:23:26,810
May I use your phone?

935
01:23:27,410 --> 01:23:29,850
Don't you want to buy betel leaves?
- That's what I'm here for.

936
01:23:30,130 --> 01:23:31,890
Give me 10 please.
- What's 10?!

937
01:23:32,290 --> 01:23:33,530
They go by the dozen!

938
01:23:33,610 --> 01:23:36,410
One dozen, or two.
- Two dozens. Can I make the call now?

939
01:23:36,650 --> 01:23:38,850
Tell me the number,
I'll dial it for you.

940
01:23:39,250 --> 01:23:40,290
People say one call...

941
01:23:40,370 --> 01:23:41,970
...but dial one too many!

942
01:23:42,490 --> 01:23:44,490
56829

943
01:23:58,690 --> 01:24:00,770
Sorry... I gave you
the wrong number.

944
01:24:00,850 --> 01:24:03,330
The correct one is 56839.

945
01:24:04,930 --> 01:24:07,290
Please wrap two dozen betel
leaves for me. Thank you.

946
01:24:09,730 --> 01:24:10,970
The weather is getting rough.

947
01:24:11,450 --> 01:24:13,730
Tell South to send some warm clothes.

948
01:24:13,810 --> 01:24:15,450
The South is unreachable.

949
01:24:16,170 --> 01:24:18,370
You'll have to bear
this weather yourself.

950
01:24:19,330 --> 01:24:20,490
How many clothes do you need?

951
01:24:20,610 --> 01:24:23,290
Just one... for the cat.

952
01:24:23,650 --> 01:24:24,410
What's the situation?

953
01:24:24,730 --> 01:24:26,450
He clawed me this morning.

954
01:24:28,610 --> 01:24:30,250
The wound can get septic.

955
01:24:30,850 --> 01:24:32,170
Get it operated.

956
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:33,410
Understand?

957
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:35,970
Yes...

958
01:24:36,050 --> 01:24:38,370
Warm clothes won't
be enough for the cat.

959
01:24:38,450 --> 01:24:39,730
Get rid of him.

960
01:24:40,010 --> 01:24:41,530
There's no other way.

961
01:24:42,450 --> 01:24:43,770
It may rain soon.

962
01:24:44,530 --> 01:24:45,930
Keep an umbrella handy.

963
01:25:18,010 --> 01:25:19,210
You found the file, didn't you?'

964
01:25:22,610 --> 01:25:23,890
For a minute it even seemed like...

965
01:25:23,970 --> 01:25:25,410
...Abdul was trying
to take your name too.

966
01:25:33,850 --> 01:25:35,250
It may rain soon.

967
01:25:35,530 --> 01:25:36,730
Keep an umbrella handy.

968
01:25:43,810 --> 01:25:47,490
As the rain pours...
The umbrella you long for...

969
01:25:47,770 --> 01:25:51,010
As the rain pours...
The umbrella you long for...

970
01:25:51,450 --> 01:25:52,930
As the rain pours...

971
01:25:55,490 --> 01:25:59,170
As the rain pours...
The umbrella you long for...

972
01:25:59,250 --> 01:26:00,410
As the rain pours...

973
01:26:00,490 --> 01:26:01,730
Would you like an umbrella, madam?

974
01:26:02,170 --> 01:26:03,410
Just 20 rupees.

975
01:26:03,610 --> 01:26:06,210
Hey... move on!
Rain in October!

976
01:26:06,290 --> 01:26:07,530
It's alright, Ismail.

977
01:26:07,770 --> 01:26:09,250
He seems like someone in need.

978
01:26:11,650 --> 01:26:14,170
Thank you, madam.
May God bless you.

979
01:26:14,250 --> 01:26:15,330
Thank you.

980
01:26:40,490 --> 01:26:41,410
Ricin.

981
01:26:41,810 --> 01:26:42,730
A kind of a poison.

982
01:26:44,610 --> 01:26:45,970
It causes a heart attack

983
01:26:46,050 --> 01:26:47,490
and doesn't get detected
in the blood either.

984
01:28:00,690 --> 01:28:02,410
'He was very loyal.'

985
01:28:02,570 --> 01:28:04,370
'And I know he would
never do anything...'

986
01:28:04,450 --> 01:28:06,370
'...to harm our family.'

987
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:17,410
Sehmat...

988
01:29:18,530 --> 01:29:20,290
Suraiya Aapa called.

989
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:23,450
She's planning a raffle for
the Army Wives Association.

990
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:26,130
She wanted to know
if we could go over.

991
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:27,810
You carry on, please...

992
01:29:28,290 --> 01:29:30,050
I'm going to the market

993
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:31,900
to buy clothes to donate

994
01:29:31,980 --> 01:29:33,290
in Abdul's name.

995
01:29:33,810 --> 01:29:36,690
Oh yes, Iqbal did tell me.

996
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:39,450
Listen...

997
01:29:40,330 --> 01:29:41,530
Don't be late.

998
01:29:41,730 --> 01:29:43,890
I've getting Trotters
made for Mehboob.

999
01:29:44,190 --> 01:29:47,050
I pray he brings some good
news from the Bureau today.

1000
01:31:30,930 --> 01:31:32,970
Are you alright, madam?

1001
01:33:24,990 --> 01:33:26,530
Let's go...

1002
01:33:28,250 --> 01:33:30,210
A lot of people have
handled this thing.

1003
01:33:30,410 --> 01:33:31,610
Perhaps you have too...

1004
01:33:32,330 --> 01:33:34,770
Getting a fingerprint won't be easy.

1005
01:33:35,180 --> 01:33:36,570
But, we will still examine it.

1006
01:33:36,650 --> 01:33:38,890
How soon can you
reach a conclusion?

1007
01:33:38,970 --> 01:33:40,930
Maybe a week.

1008
01:33:41,250 --> 01:33:42,450
Thank you.

1009
01:33:42,530 --> 01:33:44,640
You don't look well, Major.

1010
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:46,890
Yes... I am a bit uneasy.

1011
01:33:47,340 --> 01:33:49,490
I'll take your leave... Goodbye.

1012
01:34:09,530 --> 01:34:10,730
Salma.

1013
01:34:11,050 --> 01:34:12,050
Yes.

1014
01:34:12,130 --> 01:34:13,450
Lay the table...

1015
01:34:13,530 --> 01:34:15,570
Sir said he'll
return home early today.

1016
01:34:15,730 --> 01:34:16,810
Yes madam...

1017
01:34:18,370 --> 01:34:20,850
Brigade!

1018
01:34:20,930 --> 01:34:22,210
Attention!

1019
01:34:24,930 --> 01:34:26,210
Fire!

1020
01:34:28,930 --> 01:34:31,490
Brigade!

1021
01:34:31,650 --> 01:34:33,450
Eyes forward!

1022
01:34:33,610 --> 01:34:35,410
Eyes forward!

1023
01:34:37,890 --> 01:34:39,810
Brigade...

1024
01:34:40,210 --> 01:34:42,570
We salute the martyr...

1025
01:34:43,050 --> 01:34:44,970
Salute!

1026
01:35:44,920 --> 01:35:47,010
Are you going out?
- Yes.

1027
01:35:47,450 --> 01:35:49,020
I must get to the
Head Office immediately.

1028
01:35:49,100 --> 01:35:50,330
Even at this time of mourning?

1029
01:35:50,410 --> 01:35:51,890
From the three of us...

1030
01:35:54,890 --> 01:35:55,710
From the two of us,

1031
01:35:55,790 --> 01:35:57,170
One has to go.

1032
01:35:58,450 --> 01:36:00,050
Duty calls after all...

1033
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:16,130
Lt. General Beig had sent this.

1034
01:36:36,050 --> 01:36:37,410
I'll feed her.

1035
01:36:44,140 --> 01:36:45,570
I'll go check on Abba...

1036
01:36:46,020 --> 01:36:47,450
Bless you, child.

1037
01:36:52,710 --> 01:36:54,290
Oh, Lord!

1038
01:36:57,450 --> 01:36:58,610
Abba...

1039
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:03,050
How can we keep
the country safe...

1040
01:37:04,270 --> 01:37:06,730
...when our own people
turn against us?

1041
01:37:07,570 --> 01:37:10,170
I fail to understand Allah's will...

1042
01:37:11,810 --> 01:37:13,090
First Abdul...

1043
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:16,970
Then Mehboob...

1044
01:37:18,720 --> 01:37:20,770
And now this...

1045
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:44,110
'Sarvar...'

1046
01:37:44,190 --> 01:37:46,450
'Hidayat Khan's trusted friend.'

1047
01:37:46,730 --> 01:37:47,730
'If anything ever goes wrong...'

1048
01:37:47,810 --> 01:37:49,170
'...contact him immediately.'

1049
01:37:52,770 --> 01:37:53,330
Hello.

1050
01:37:53,410 --> 01:37:54,890
Sarvar Store.
- Yes.

1051
01:37:54,970 --> 01:37:57,450
I need to buy provisions
to make an offering.

1052
01:37:57,650 --> 01:37:58,970
It is urgent.

1053
01:37:59,240 --> 01:38:01,930
Can I come over in 30 minutes?
- Yes.

1054
01:38:02,420 --> 01:38:03,770
I'll be waiting.

1055
01:38:07,610 --> 01:38:10,050
Madam, you could've told me...

1056
01:38:10,450 --> 01:38:12,370
...or one of the staff could
have bought the provisions.

1057
01:38:12,450 --> 01:38:13,450
It's alright.

1058
01:38:13,850 --> 01:38:15,610
Getting out makes
me feel lighter.

1059
01:38:18,770 --> 01:38:19,930
I'll be right back.

1060
01:38:34,530 --> 01:38:36,090
I also want chickpeas...

1061
01:38:37,050 --> 01:38:38,410
...Of 8mm size.

1062
01:38:41,450 --> 01:38:42,730
This way, please.

1063
01:38:48,090 --> 01:38:51,170
Saadiq and Imtiyaz have been
arrested by the agency.

1064
01:38:52,180 --> 01:38:54,650
Kabir Sir is being
monitored as well.

1065
01:38:56,090 --> 01:38:56,890
...by the agency.

1066
01:38:56,970 --> 01:38:58,170
Is there any way to
speak to Mir Sir?

1067
01:38:58,450 --> 01:38:59,450
Seems unlikely...

1068
01:39:00,450 --> 01:39:02,130
All the lines to
India are shut down.

1069
01:39:02,370 --> 01:39:04,930
The guerrillas have blown
up a bridge in the East.

1070
01:39:05,300 --> 01:39:07,250
That India is supplying
them with weapons...

1071
01:39:07,410 --> 01:39:09,770
...the Pakistani military
is now convinced of it.

1072
01:39:11,310 --> 01:39:13,450
War is inevitable now.

1073
01:39:18,250 --> 01:39:20,170
Are you in any kind of danger?

1074
01:39:20,790 --> 01:39:22,410
Not that I know of.

1075
01:39:22,820 --> 01:39:24,270
God be with you.

1076
01:39:24,410 --> 01:39:25,890
If ever you feel
you're in danger...

1077
01:39:26,210 --> 01:39:29,370
...keep the light on in
your bathroom as a signal.

1078
01:39:29,650 --> 01:39:31,210
We'll get you out.

1079
01:39:35,090 --> 01:39:36,490
Thank you.

1080
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:44,290
I want 8mm sized chickpeas.

1081
01:39:45,290 --> 01:39:46,530
Please leave immediately.

1082
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:48,730
Your husband is in danger.

1083
01:40:05,070 --> 01:40:06,170
Sir...

1084
01:40:08,580 --> 01:40:10,370
Sir, we tried every possible way.

1085
01:40:10,650 --> 01:40:12,970
But it's impossible to
reach any of our contacts...

1086
01:40:13,140 --> 01:40:14,890
Not even the First Secretary.

1087
01:40:16,250 --> 01:40:18,130
And Sir, we have just learned that

1088
01:40:18,210 --> 01:40:20,210
the switch-board line has
been compromised as well.

1089
01:40:29,420 --> 01:40:31,290
Sehmat is left all alone.

1090
01:40:32,770 --> 01:40:34,130
With no support.

1091
01:40:34,290 --> 01:40:36,530
And we have no idea
what is going on that side.

1092
01:40:38,890 --> 01:40:40,450
Prepare a backup team immediately...

1093
01:40:40,690 --> 01:40:42,210
...and get Sehmat out of there.

1094
01:40:42,450 --> 01:40:43,570
Yes, sir.

1095
01:40:52,770 --> 01:40:54,180
Has Abba gone out?
- Yes.

1096
01:40:54,260 --> 01:40:56,210
He got a phone call
and left immediately.

1097
01:41:04,630 --> 01:41:06,630
Allah have mercy!

1098
01:41:38,390 --> 01:41:39,910
Check in that corner.

1099
01:43:16,830 --> 01:43:19,910
Abba... are you leaving?

1100
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:22,190
There's a lot going
on in the country, child.

1101
01:43:23,490 --> 01:43:25,110
This is not the time
for me to mourn.

1102
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:27,110
Should I wake Iqbal up?
- No.

1103
01:43:27,310 --> 01:43:29,790
Iqbal returned quite late last
night from the Headquarters.

1104
01:43:29,950 --> 01:43:31,190
Let him sleep.

1105
01:43:31,480 --> 01:43:32,790
You can wake him up later.

1106
01:43:34,990 --> 01:43:37,590
Munira will be staying with
her parents for some time...

1107
01:43:38,360 --> 01:43:39,510
...in Karachi.

1108
01:43:41,030 --> 01:43:42,510
Take care of yourself...

1109
01:43:43,310 --> 01:43:44,590
I will be back soon.

1110
01:43:46,110 --> 01:43:48,590
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1111
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:59,190
You returned late last night.

1112
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:01,630
Why don't you rest some more?

1113
01:44:02,790 --> 01:44:03,910
Not today...

1114
01:44:04,830 --> 01:44:06,630
I'll rest another time.

1115
01:44:12,270 --> 01:44:13,910
Where is Major General
Syed's residence?

1116
01:44:13,990 --> 01:44:15,230
And you are?

1117
01:44:15,390 --> 01:44:16,470
Col. Bashir Ahmed.

1118
01:44:16,710 --> 01:44:18,070
Take the next left.

1119
01:44:37,030 --> 01:44:38,190
Sir.

1120
01:44:38,490 --> 01:44:40,550
Col. Bashir Ahmed is here.

1121
01:44:45,710 --> 01:44:46,750
Sir.

1122
01:44:47,110 --> 01:44:47,910
I apologize, Colonel...

1123
01:44:47,990 --> 01:44:49,750
...but Father isn't at home right now.

1124
01:44:54,340 --> 01:44:56,710
I'm here to offer my condolences.

1125
01:44:58,950 --> 01:45:01,190
Major Mehboob once
served in my unit.

1126
01:45:11,450 --> 01:45:14,390
I wasn't here at the time
of his unfortunate demise.

1127
01:45:16,070 --> 01:45:17,710
I'm very sorry for your loss...

1128
01:45:25,870 --> 01:45:27,470
My wife, Sehmat.

1129
01:45:27,750 --> 01:45:29,750
And this is Col. Bashir Ahmed.

1130
01:45:30,110 --> 01:45:32,030
Brother once served under his command.

1131
01:45:32,950 --> 01:45:34,790
Sir... there's a
Phone call for you...

1132
01:45:35,950 --> 01:45:37,030
Excuse me...

1133
01:45:57,710 --> 01:46:00,110
I want to buy some
toys for my grandson.

1134
01:46:02,870 --> 01:46:04,790
I've heard that the
Crowne Plaza Mall...

1135
01:46:05,190 --> 01:46:06,710
...is quite well known?

1136
01:46:07,230 --> 01:46:09,230
Does it have a toy shop?

1137
01:46:10,750 --> 01:46:12,510
Yes, it does.

1138
01:46:14,110 --> 01:46:15,550
What kind of toy
are you looking for?

1139
01:46:16,790 --> 01:46:18,430
A motorboat perhaps?

1140
01:46:20,910 --> 01:46:22,310
That's exactly what I'm looking for.

1141
01:46:23,110 --> 01:46:24,270
You'll find one there.

1142
01:46:24,710 --> 01:46:25,710
Perfect.

1143
01:46:27,070 --> 01:46:28,630
I will go to buy it in two hours.

1144
01:46:35,390 --> 01:46:37,110
I'll take your leave, young man.

1145
01:46:39,080 --> 01:46:41,030
Give my regards to your father.

1146
01:46:41,190 --> 01:46:42,390
Yes Sir.

1147
01:46:54,190 --> 01:46:55,470
Abba had called...

1148
01:46:55,870 --> 01:46:57,190
Some kind of transmission

1149
01:46:57,270 --> 01:46:58,390
has been intercepted
from our home.

1150
01:46:58,470 --> 01:47:00,350
A surveillance team
has been posted outside.

1151
01:47:00,630 --> 01:47:02,190
Munira has been taken
to the agency...

1152
01:47:02,430 --> 01:47:03,870
to record her statement.

1153
01:47:07,510 --> 01:47:08,110
Tell everyone that

1154
01:47:08,190 --> 01:47:09,510
no one steps out of the
house without permission.

1155
01:47:09,710 --> 01:47:10,430
Yes Sir.

1156
01:47:11,190 --> 01:47:12,990
Someone from the Agency
will come for you too...

1157
01:47:13,270 --> 01:47:14,910
...to take your statement as well.

1158
01:47:19,990 --> 01:47:21,190
Sir.

1159
01:47:36,910 --> 01:47:39,830
'If you ever feel that your
cover is about to be blown...'

1160
01:47:40,070 --> 01:47:41,470
'...it most probably already is.'

1161
01:47:45,510 --> 01:47:46,310
Hello.

1162
01:47:46,390 --> 01:47:48,270
This is General Syed's
daughter-in-law speaking.

1163
01:47:48,510 --> 01:47:50,790
I must speak with Suraiya
Begum. It is urgent.

1164
01:47:51,030 --> 01:47:52,110
Hold on.

1165
01:47:53,950 --> 01:47:56,710
Sehmat. Is everything okay?

1166
01:47:56,790 --> 01:47:58,590
There's been some trouble,
Suraiya Ma'am.

1167
01:47:58,710 --> 01:48:00,270
Could we meet immediately?

1168
01:48:00,510 --> 01:48:02,550
But I don't have
a car or a driver.

1169
01:48:02,750 --> 01:48:03,710
Don't worry...

1170
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:04,830
I'll send a car for you.

1171
01:48:05,190 --> 01:48:06,390
Thank you.

1172
01:48:11,390 --> 01:48:13,750
Yes?
- From Col Siddiqui's residence.

1173
01:48:34,710 --> 01:48:35,470
Where are you going?

1174
01:48:35,550 --> 01:48:36,990
Col. Imtiaz Siddiqui's house.

1175
01:48:37,070 --> 01:48:38,230
This is his car.

1176
01:48:58,710 --> 01:49:02,390
Our late servant Adbul,
was from India.

1177
01:49:03,190 --> 01:49:05,790
And it seems that
he was an informer.

1178
01:49:07,030 --> 01:49:09,090
It is possible that
he may have passed

1179
01:49:09,170 --> 01:49:11,110
sensitive information to our enemy.

1180
01:49:11,500 --> 01:49:13,830
But now our family will
have to bear the brunt.

1181
01:49:14,440 --> 01:49:15,870
They have taken Munira away...

1182
01:49:16,150 --> 01:49:17,510
And, are now coming for you too.

1183
01:49:17,710 --> 01:49:19,230
It's not me I am worried about...

1184
01:49:19,310 --> 01:49:21,630
...but Munira is a very simple girl.

1185
01:49:21,950 --> 01:49:23,350
And at a time like this...

1186
01:49:24,190 --> 01:49:26,710
This no way to treat
the widow of an Army officer.

1187
01:49:27,870 --> 01:49:30,190
You're the VC of the
Army Wives Association...

1188
01:49:30,590 --> 01:49:32,550
...maybe your stepping in could help.

1189
01:49:32,750 --> 01:49:34,030
Of course.

1190
01:49:34,550 --> 01:49:36,550
Wait here, I'll be right back.

1191
01:49:51,910 --> 01:49:54,910
Sir...
- Please come inside.

1192
01:49:56,550 --> 01:49:59,430
Allah is truly benevolent!

1193
01:49:59,630 --> 01:50:01,750
They are sending Munira home.

1194
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:04,870
They wanted to record her
statement for the investigation.

1195
01:50:04,950 --> 01:50:06,030
But I made it clear that

1196
01:50:06,160 --> 01:50:08,430
there is a time and place
to carry out formalities.

1197
01:50:08,870 --> 01:50:10,950
The house confinement
will be lifted as well.

1198
01:50:11,220 --> 01:50:13,270
I am truly grateful
to you, Suraiya ma'am.

1199
01:50:13,430 --> 01:50:15,310
We shall forever be
indebted to you.

1200
01:50:15,550 --> 01:50:17,470
We are like family, Sehmat.

1201
01:50:17,710 --> 01:50:19,390
Let me know if I can
be of any more help.

1202
01:50:19,470 --> 01:50:20,630
Yes.

1203
01:50:20,950 --> 01:50:21,830
Hello Miss...

1204
01:50:22,330 --> 01:50:23,230
Anwar...

1205
01:50:23,710 --> 01:50:25,710
How are you?
- I am fine Miss.

1206
01:50:30,910 --> 01:50:32,910
You see Major, the piece
found in Abdul's hand

1207
01:50:32,990 --> 01:50:34,620
belongs to a Morse unit.

1208
01:50:34,750 --> 01:50:35,950
That's why this search is necessary.

1209
01:50:36,710 --> 01:50:38,910
Sir, Mehboob had rummaged
through the entire room.

1210
01:50:39,190 --> 01:50:40,350
He didn't find anything.

1211
01:50:46,520 --> 01:50:47,590
Sir.

1212
01:51:01,660 --> 01:51:03,190
Shall we inform the Head Office?

1213
01:51:08,510 --> 01:51:11,390
We've recovered some
transmission equipment inside...

1214
01:51:11,610 --> 01:51:13,550
Make an entry of them.

1215
01:53:26,750 --> 01:53:27,590
Sit down.

1216
01:53:31,030 --> 01:53:32,990
Use two bullets, Sehmat.

1217
01:53:35,350 --> 01:53:39,110
One for me, and one for you...

1218
01:53:41,500 --> 01:53:43,190
There is no other way.

1219
01:53:46,670 --> 01:53:48,310
The Agency doesn't know yet...

1220
01:53:50,450 --> 01:53:52,990
...because they don't have
the evidence that I do.

1221
01:53:59,730 --> 01:54:01,950
Was anything ever real between us?

1222
01:54:05,550 --> 01:54:07,750
I never wanted it to be like this...

1223
01:54:09,470 --> 01:54:11,070
But everything just
spiralled out of control.

1224
01:54:11,190 --> 01:54:12,990
Was any of it true, Sehmat?

1225
01:54:21,470 --> 01:54:23,230
Even if I do tell
you the truth...

1226
01:54:25,060 --> 01:54:26,910
...will you believe me?

1227
01:54:30,190 --> 01:54:32,510
But the supreme truth
here is that...

1228
01:54:33,790 --> 01:54:36,390
...nothing is more important
to me, than my country.

1229
01:54:44,030 --> 01:54:45,750
I love you, Sehmat.

1230
01:54:50,710 --> 01:54:54,750
But love can never come
before the country.

1231
01:54:57,380 --> 01:54:59,390
And who knows that
better than you?

1232
01:55:05,950 --> 01:55:08,750
I have never used force with you.

1233
01:55:10,710 --> 01:55:12,350
And I wouldn't want to start now.

1234
01:55:13,070 --> 01:55:13,910
Miss!

1235
01:55:14,270 --> 01:55:15,390
Aunt Munira is back!

1236
01:55:33,030 --> 01:55:35,730
We'll buy ice cream
and toys as well...

1237
01:55:41,710 --> 01:55:42,550
He's just a child.

1238
01:55:44,020 --> 01:55:45,070
That he remains safe,

1239
01:55:46,380 --> 01:55:47,620
is up to you.

1240
01:56:11,380 --> 01:56:13,060
How dare she?!

1241
01:56:13,610 --> 01:56:14,930
A girl...

1242
01:56:15,810 --> 01:56:19,770
A two-bit girl has ruined
our entire family!

1243
01:56:20,290 --> 01:56:23,250
Shattered our love, and our trust!

1244
01:56:26,700 --> 01:56:27,770
Hidayat...

1245
01:56:31,600 --> 01:56:33,170
He was my friend.

1246
01:56:35,490 --> 01:56:37,410
But how could I forget...

1247
01:56:37,930 --> 01:56:41,610
...that he was an Indian after all.

1248
01:56:47,230 --> 01:56:48,890
It is all my fault.

1249
01:56:51,460 --> 01:56:55,210
Our country is in danger
because of my foolishness...

1250
01:56:57,610 --> 01:57:02,410
And it is my foolishness that
has ruined your life too.

1251
01:57:05,490 --> 01:57:08,210
Forgive me, son.
- No, Abba.

1252
01:57:09,170 --> 01:57:10,730
Please don't say that.

1253
01:57:12,850 --> 01:57:14,410
Whatever has happened...

1254
01:57:15,890 --> 01:57:17,890
...we need to control
the situation first.

1255
01:57:20,210 --> 01:57:22,210
You should inform the Agency.

1256
01:57:35,170 --> 01:57:36,410
Our daughter-in-law...

1257
01:57:37,210 --> 01:57:39,450
...has taken off with
Siddiqui Sir's grandson...

1258
01:57:39,890 --> 01:57:41,330
That is what I will tell the Agency?

1259
01:57:42,770 --> 01:57:44,770
That bloody...
- Abba.

1260
01:57:47,170 --> 01:57:48,850
Whatever she did...

1261
01:57:50,050 --> 01:57:51,610
...she did for her country.

1262
01:57:53,610 --> 01:57:54,890
Like we do.

1263
01:58:02,970 --> 01:58:04,170
One final check.

1264
01:58:04,450 --> 01:58:05,670
Sir, as soon as the car arrives

1265
01:58:05,750 --> 01:58:07,490
and the target gets down,
we aim to isolate her.

1266
01:58:07,650 --> 01:58:09,420
I'll lead the target
to the toy shop.

1267
01:58:09,500 --> 01:58:11,010
And exit from the back door.

1268
01:58:11,090 --> 01:58:12,890
I'll cover the target
from the first floor.

1269
01:58:13,270 --> 01:58:15,490
I'll lead the target from
the toy shop to the transport.

1270
01:58:15,660 --> 01:58:17,090
Agent 4 will wait
at the back exit

1271
01:58:17,170 --> 01:58:18,330
with the transport.

1272
01:58:18,490 --> 01:58:19,570
Copy Sir.

1273
01:58:19,850 --> 01:58:21,330
Mic check.
- Good check, Sir.

1274
01:58:21,500 --> 01:58:22,850
To your stations.

1275
01:59:13,570 --> 01:59:14,730
Target sighted.

1276
01:59:25,850 --> 01:59:27,770
Agent 1 move in, isolate target.

1277
01:59:46,390 --> 01:59:47,290
Abort exfiltration.

1278
01:59:47,370 --> 01:59:48,450
Abort exfiltration!

1279
01:59:48,530 --> 01:59:49,370
Target compromised.

1280
01:59:49,450 --> 01:59:50,570
I repeat, abort!

1281
01:59:54,100 --> 01:59:55,170
Sir...

1282
01:59:55,610 --> 01:59:56,930
Their agents are everywhere.

1283
02:00:08,250 --> 02:00:09,850
Sir... they have her!

1284
02:00:12,930 --> 02:00:14,090
Shift to Plan B.

1285
02:00:16,770 --> 02:00:18,050
What are you saying, Sir?!

1286
02:00:18,170 --> 02:00:19,170
It's the only way...

1287
02:00:19,690 --> 02:00:21,570
We can't get her out, and we
can't leave her behind either.

1288
02:00:27,750 --> 02:00:29,250
Nothing before the Nation...

1289
02:00:31,510 --> 02:00:32,490
Now.

1290
02:02:15,130 --> 02:02:16,250
Wait here.
- Yes.

1291
02:02:16,330 --> 02:02:17,170
I'll be right back.

1292
02:02:27,850 --> 02:02:30,090
Brother Sarvar, maybe
I'm being followed.

1293
02:02:30,260 --> 02:02:32,170
I must get to Crowne Plaza.

1294
02:04:06,090 --> 02:04:08,250
Killing Iqbal was never
part of the plan.

1295
02:04:13,380 --> 02:04:14,660
Why?

1296
02:04:16,420 --> 02:04:17,900
Why did you kill him?

1297
02:04:21,620 --> 02:04:24,740
What loyalty do you
preach and practice?

1298
02:04:29,050 --> 02:04:33,300
You even gave orders to kill me!

1299
02:04:37,380 --> 02:04:40,020
Even poor Nafisa lost her life.

1300
02:04:42,780 --> 02:04:44,300
That decision was yours.

1301
02:04:45,620 --> 02:04:47,300
Only you will bear the consequences.

1302
02:04:50,220 --> 02:04:56,020
I sacrificed my conscience,
my life, for you!

1303
02:04:56,900 --> 02:05:00,260
And you didn't hesitate
to take my life.

1304
02:05:12,500 --> 02:05:14,220
That is the nature of war Sehmat.

1305
02:05:15,400 --> 02:05:17,100
Innocent lives are lost
in collateral damage.

1306
02:05:18,860 --> 02:05:20,620
But during war,
except for the war,

1307
02:05:21,350 --> 02:05:23,020
nothing else matters.

1308
02:05:24,220 --> 02:05:25,420
No one matters.

1309
02:05:26,260 --> 02:05:28,500
Not you. Not me.

1310
02:05:29,300 --> 02:05:30,340
No one.

1311
02:05:49,380 --> 02:05:52,220
I don't understand
this world of yours...

1312
02:05:56,860 --> 02:06:00,220
Where relationships don't matter,
and neither does life.

1313
02:06:10,100 --> 02:06:12,940
Before I become completely like you,

1314
02:06:13,020 --> 02:06:14,740
I want out of all this.

1315
02:06:16,310 --> 02:06:18,140
I want to go back home!

1316
02:06:18,660 --> 02:06:20,820
I want to go home!

1317
02:06:21,760 --> 02:06:23,980
I want to go back home!

1318
02:07:41,220 --> 02:07:42,260
The...

1319
02:07:44,220 --> 02:07:47,140
Doctors are saying that you...
- I know.

1320
02:07:50,220 --> 02:07:52,420
But I won't abort Iqbal's child.

1321
02:07:56,300 --> 02:07:58,100
I can't commit another murder...

1322
02:08:09,420 --> 02:08:12,140
Our Intel has intercepted
a message from Pakistan.

1323
02:08:13,020 --> 02:08:14,500
There's been an inquiry
at Chittagong port

1324
02:08:14,580 --> 02:08:15,580
for a special lubrication oil...

1325
02:08:16,060 --> 02:08:18,620
...which is only used in
submarines and mine sweepers.

1326
02:08:19,380 --> 02:08:21,740
And only one Pakistani submarine...

1327
02:08:22,020 --> 02:08:24,460
...can cover the distance between
Pakistan And Vishakapatnam.

1328
02:08:24,980 --> 02:08:26,220
PNS Ghazi...

1329
02:08:28,420 --> 02:08:30,900
...which has set sail
to target INS Vikrant.

1330
02:08:35,380 --> 02:08:37,220
Pakistani submarine PNS Ghazi...

1331
02:08:37,300 --> 02:08:39,140
has sunk near Vishakapatnam.

1332
02:08:39,500 --> 02:08:42,140
INS Vikrant's strict
vigil in the Bay of Bengal

1333
02:08:42,220 --> 02:08:44,380
has proven to be successful.

1334
02:08:44,580 --> 02:08:47,860
Our Navy and Air Force
have extensively damaged

1335
02:08:47,940 --> 02:08:51,540
the ports of East
and West Pakistan.

1336
02:08:51,820 --> 02:08:54,380
Pakistani forces in East Pakistan

1337
02:08:54,460 --> 02:08:57,060
have laid down their weapons
in surrender to the Indian Army.

1338
02:08:57,140 --> 02:09:00,740
Last evening Pakistan announced
a unilateral ceasefire.

1339
02:09:00,980 --> 02:09:02,500
India has won the war.

1340
02:09:21,140 --> 02:09:22,860
While celebrating our victory...

1341
02:09:24,220 --> 02:09:25,620
...we also remember...

1342
02:09:27,270 --> 02:09:29,100
...all that we have lost.

1343
02:09:30,910 --> 02:09:35,220
Death is not the only
consequence of war.

1344
02:09:39,060 --> 02:09:41,020
Some casualties of war

1345
02:09:41,890 --> 02:09:43,020
remain alive, as well.

1346
02:09:47,060 --> 02:09:49,940
I may not remain,

1347
02:09:50,780 --> 02:09:54,580
not even in memory...

1348
02:09:56,700 --> 02:10:00,060
I may not remain,

1349
02:10:00,140 --> 02:10:04,020
not even in memory...

1350
02:10:05,010 --> 02:10:09,350
But in safe hands,

1351
02:10:09,430 --> 02:10:12,460
you will always be.

1352
02:10:12,920 --> 02:10:17,020
But in safe hands,

1353
02:10:17,380 --> 02:10:20,580
you will always be.

1354
02:10:20,900 --> 02:10:25,300
My country.. my motherland...!
