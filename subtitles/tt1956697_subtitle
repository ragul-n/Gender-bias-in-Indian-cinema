00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:15,891
All the characters and
the incidents in this film are fictions

2
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:01,700
Why did you cut my Kite string?

3
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:04,453
It's cut, now, get lost!

4
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:10,376
What are you staring at?
Get lost

5
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:18,717
You hit me! Wait, I'll
get my younger brother

6
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:31,397
Hey! Who hit my brother?

7
00:04:32,982 --> 00:04:35,401
I dare you to touch him now

8
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:40,239
I hit him
What will you do?

9
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,327
You dared to hit me

10
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:47,913
I won't leave you

11
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:03,262
- Will you go?
- Dad, don't!

12
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:06,849
Will you get into a fight?

13
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:08,517
- Will you go?
- Dad, don't!

14
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,935
- How many times have I told you!
- Dad, please don't!

15
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:10,686
Why can't you listen to me?

16
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,688
- It'll hurt, dad
- Will you go?

17
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:15,274
Open your mouth and tell me
Will you go?

18
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,109
I won't
I won't get into a fight

19
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:20,696
I will kill you if I see
you get in to another fight

20
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:23,115
Does it hurt?

21
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:28,620
Looks like the older
one got it from you

22
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:30,372
You whacked him real hard

23
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:33,125
No way, it was the
younger one who got it

24
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,210
But the older one made all the noise

25
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:38,547
Despite the beating, there's
no whimper from the younger one

26
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:41,800
Imagine what will happen
if I had hit the older boy

27
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:43,969
So, this is what happened!

28
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:52,478
Take this

29
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:58,984
He hit me, why are you crying?

30
00:05:59,068 --> 00:06:01,737
You got hit because of me

31
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:04,406
Does it hurt?

32
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:08,327
No, it feels good! If you get
hit by a belt, will it not hurt?

33
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:12,748
If dad hits you, can't
hit him back, can you?

34
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:13,999
That's why I took it

35
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:18,504
Shouldn't be scared to
hit someone or get hit

36
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:36,772
Don't be scared, light it

37
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,028
Hey, light it

38
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:46,949
- Wait, dad!
- As if he is going to light it

39
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:53,205
Light it

40
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:09,638
The Hunt

41
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:58,353
<i>It's Happiness</i>

42
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:05,861
It's a Beginning

43
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:13,619
<i>Anywhere, Anytime
Our lives will be joyful</i>

44
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:21,126
Anywhere, Anytime
Let's celebrate, Life is a Celebration

45
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:26,632
The skies will bless
you with rain clouds

46
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:33,263
<i>The earth will gift you with flowers</i>

47
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:36,308
We are the tireless playboys

48
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:40,479
Beautiful girls go crazy seeing us

49
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:43,982
<i>There is no squabble we've spared</i>

50
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:48,153
And yet, we 're the nice guys

51
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:55,577
<i>It's Happiness</i>

52
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,001
It's a Beginning

53
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:30,779
What is your name?

54
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,781
Oh God! it's dad

55
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:47,337
<i>If a colorful butterfly
comes in search of you</i>

56
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:50,966
Don't miss the chance,
just take it along

57
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:54,720
If a flower-like beauty seeks you out

58
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:58,390
Turn your heart' in to a bouquet

59
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:02,060
If you see a gorgeous girl is father

60
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:05,814
Hide that cigarette
you were about to light

61
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:09,484
And if her brother comes by

62
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:13,155
Turn him in to your brother in law

63
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:16,158
We are the tireless playboys

64
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:20,495
Beautiful girls go crazy seeing us

65
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:23,832
<i>There is no squabble we've spared</i>

66
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:28,003
And yet, we 're the nice guys

67
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:59,451
If a girl sets her glance on us

68
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:03,121
She will rank high in our minds

69
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:06,792
And if the same girl
doesn't spare a glance

70
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:10,545
<i>We'll drown our sorrows with a drink</i>

71
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:14,132
If there is a new friend we can trap

72
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:17,886
We'll turn him in to a
Bill Gates who funds us

73
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:21,473
And if he feels troubled by it

74
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:25,227
We'll put an end to that friendship

75
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,230
We are the tireless playboys

76
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:32,567
Beautiful girls go crazy seeing us

77
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:35,821
<i>There is no squabble we've spared</i>

78
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:40,158
And yet, we 're the nice guys

79
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,457
<i>It's Happiness</i>

80
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:55,006
It's a Beginning

81
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:05,600
Why this transfer suddenly?

82
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:08,019
We're not going to stay
quiet even if we go there

83
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:11,356
It's the same Uniform, the same duty
that we'll do there... Let's see

84
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,692
Could we have played it down a little...

85
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:17,362
They'll make one blunder after the other,
Can we keep looking??

86
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:19,948
Don't support them

87
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,368
Where did you find these Gentlemen?

88
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,955
The Transfer is on for next week,
ask them to be ready

89
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:27,956
Yes Sir

90
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,962
I am watching a movie,
will call you back

91
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:37,048
Sorry Bro

92
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:47,142
A guy has just poured
Coffee on our Brother, get him!!

93
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,485
Give way

94
00:12:57,819 --> 00:12:59,571
Why are you rushing in like this?

95
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:01,907
I just knocked a guy outside

96
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,742
What? You're sounding like me now

97
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:07,412
I just knocked a guy by mistake,
and they're chasing me

98
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:09,581
They look like thugs, I am scared

99
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:11,750
Don't worry about it,
just watch the movie

100
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,423
- Hey! They're here
- Watch the movie!

101
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:19,925
I am scared

102
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,259
We'll handle it
Watch the movie

103
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:23,595
- They're here
- Let them

104
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:30,602
Hello! You're blocking my view
Move

105
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,020
Keep quiet

106
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,189
Someone's pushed our Bro, is
watching a movie more important to you?

107
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:36,024
Whatever it is, now move out

108
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:39,945
You're making too much of a noise!
Do you know who we are?

109
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:44,616
What's your problem?
Who is your brother?

110
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:46,868
You are asking them who Big Bro is?

111
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:49,204
So, he is your brother?

112
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:50,872
Gone with just one whack!!!

113
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,549
Go go... Sit down

114
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:02,050
Go on with the movie

115
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:04,803
Who is that raising his voice?

116
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:08,056
- Get him
- Hey, wait

117
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:16,648
I am not the one Sir!
I don't know anything Sir!

118
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:22,988
Please leave me, sir

119
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:26,074
- I'll finish you
- Look there

120
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:32,998
Hey! Why haven't you ironed your Shirt?

121
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:35,250
Buddy! I don't want a soft drink

122
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,835
We had a drink earlier, didn't we?

123
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:39,588
Tell him
They don't listen ya...

124
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:44,926
Fine, go now

125
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:49,431
This wasn't a real fight

126
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:52,684
Don't get us into
trouble with Dad for this

127
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,352
Did you come here to watch a movie?

128
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,104
We're caught

129
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,723
We were searching for you everywhere

130
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,142
He was lying down after
he came back from work

131
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:35,977
He hasn't got up since then

132
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:43,568
He said it was a Transfer, is this it?

133
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:06,508
This Police job won't suit me,
I don't want it

134
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:09,844
Dad and Grand Dad were policemen,
let's not miss the chain

135
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:11,429
- Agree to it
- Why don't you accept it?

136
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:13,765
- Like they will give me a job!
- Why not?

137
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:17,769
- As it is I have 4
cases filed against me - 4 Cases!?

138
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:19,771
I was fighting for you
in each of these cases

139
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:25,735
Thugs, Police Stations, Pistols...

140
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:27,445
...Court cases,
these things won't work with me

141
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:28,780
Let's find something else to do

142
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:31,199
No, you're a timid guy

143
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:34,285
If you wear the Police Uniform,
people will be scared of you

144
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:37,872
Guys will salute you, this
is the best job for you

145
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:40,875
Bro, why are you quiet,
help him understand this

146
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,463
People were scared even when
they just saw your Dad's cycle

147
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:48,299
You will become brave by
merely wearing the Police Uniform

148
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:52,387
It's Dad's job, it's come to you
Why are you refusing it?

149
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,638
Come on

150
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:59,644
My brother has agreed
You go ahead and make arrangements

151
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:01,646
Okay brother, ok brother, let's go

152
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:02,564
Hey!

153
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:21,666
You girls seem very excited

154
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,335
Has that boy agreed
to marry your sister?

155
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:27,422
Shut up! Can't you utter a good word?

156
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:29,340
The boy has run away

157
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:32,802
What did you do for him to run away?

158
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:35,096
We laid out tough conditions for him

159
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,098
What conditions did you girls put?

160
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,976
Where are you people?

161
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,229
Hey scarecrow in the corn fields...

162
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:26,981
My sister's waiting

163
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,903
Where are you people?

164
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:34,155
Hey scarecrow in the corn fields...

165
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:37,242
My sister's waiting

166
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:42,330
<i>Hey little Frog
and the fishes down the stream</i>

167
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:47,335
Let me tell you how her Groom should be

168
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:52,257
Oh Butterfly, listen to me
”Touch me Not” plants listen to me

169
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:57,262
Sparrows listen to me
Listen to the big list we have

170
00:18:57,345 --> 00:19:07,772
<i>Where is the best' match for my Sister?</i>

171
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:51,983
He shouldn't have a scary moustache
like the Warrior Gods

172
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:56,988
<i>Neither should he have a thin
moustache like an adolescent boy</i>

173
00:19:57,071 --> 00:20:02,076
Don'! want' a very studious guy
Nor do we want' a dullard

174
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,998
Don't want him to be pencil thin
Nor should he look like Mike Tyson

175
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:09,584
He should keep at pleading

176
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:12,086
even if his ears warm
up from the long calls

177
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:17,008
<i>He should continue speaking sweetly
even after the wedding is over</i>

178
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:21,596
He shouldn't '2' forget me
when he goes to office

179
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,684
He shouldn't '2' bring up
office when he's home

180
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:31,773
He should turn in to my friend
when I lean on his shoulders

181
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:37,445
<i>I need a Man who will
care for me like a mother</i>

182
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:48,289
<i>Where is the best' match for my Sister?</i>

183
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:37,171
I don't want a man
dressed in crisscross shirts

184
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:42,051
<i>I don't want a man
who'll cross the lines I draw</i>

185
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:47,181
<i>I don want a man who will
stare at my Shopping Bills</i>

186
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:52,186
He should fall for my love
like a fish falling for its bait'

187
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:57,191
He should spot me in
my childhood photographs

188
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:59,694
<i>We should read the
love letters I received</i>

189
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:02,196
and tear them up together

190
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:06,868
He should never doubt me

191
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:11,873
<i>But he shouldn't 't be scared
if I give him a doubtful glance</i>

192
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:16,878
He doesn't have to praise me
He doesn't have to shower me with care

193
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:22,550
Just a glance will do... forever...

194
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:32,894
<i>Where is the best' match for my Sister?</i>

195
00:22:58,002 --> 00:22:59,504
Please don't touch the flowers,
they won't come below Rs 15

196
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:01,005
Give me a coconut

197
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:02,924
Give me a good one

198
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:06,177
Hey, leave me

199
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:09,931
Sir, he's the one who started...

200
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:13,684
Go away

201
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,626
- Take this
- I don't need money Sir

202
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:42,046
Will anyone take money from you?

203
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:44,715
It's fine
Take it

204
00:23:57,562 --> 00:24:00,898
- Ya, tell me
- You were right...

205
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:03,067
...there's a lot of
respect for Policemen

206
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:04,652
Two guys were fighting on the road...

207
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:06,654
...they saw me and
moved away immediately

208
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:08,906
A guy dropped a cigarette on seeing me,

209
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:11,159
the shopkeeper
didn't take money from me

210
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:12,577
Really?

211
00:24:13,828 --> 00:24:17,999
Temple Bells are ringing, Am
getting good signs everywhere

212
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:22,086
This is just the beginning,
just wait and watch

213
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,212
Is that so?

214
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:25,006
Sure, will call you once I join work

215
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:35,224
- Take this
- it's fine

216
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:51,282
Your husband must have
stolen your Saree...

217
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:55,870
- Good morning sir
- Ask him about it first

218
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:21,395
Sign here

219
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:07,858
Can't hear you clearly
against the sound of the flames

220
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:10,444
It's all over

221
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:12,780
That useless guy is dead and gone

222
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,449
He thought he can escape if he
comes to the Police Station

223
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:17,118
We burnt him down right here

224
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:19,787
That's not a problem

225
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:23,624
They are our men

226
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:25,960
I'll take care of it, will hang up now

227
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:03,664
Why the hell are you trembling?
Isn't that to drink?

228
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,000
Bring it

229
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:17,678
You know what happened, don't you?

230
00:27:17,762 --> 00:27:21,098
His wife and him had a problem
Silly guy

231
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:22,266
Burnt himself

232
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,102
That's how you need to file the case

233
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:27,021
Big Bro is involved

234
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:29,607
You know what will
happen if you oppose him

235
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:34,445
Let's go

236
00:27:50,628 --> 00:27:52,880
They burnt him right in
front of the Police Station

237
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:54,882
All of you were merely watching

238
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:56,967
- Who are these people?
- You've just come

239
00:27:57,051 --> 00:27:59,053
There's a lot more to witness

240
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:02,556
What's up Azhagu?

241
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,725
Looks like they burnt
him right at the doorstep

242
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:07,478
Was dazzling!
Are you happy?

243
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:09,647
"The life of justice
will be engulfed by deceit

244
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,232
But justice will prevail

245
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:13,317
The Law will do its duty”

246
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:16,237
Where is the Law?
It seems to be merely watching

247
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,572
They are going to burn everyone down

248
00:28:18,656 --> 00:28:21,826
No one has the guts
No one has the nerve

249
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:23,994
More will be burnt, a lot more to come

250
00:28:24,078 --> 00:28:25,579
Keep watching like this

251
00:28:25,663 --> 00:28:27,832
They will burn you
guys down too one day

252
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:32,920
Yeah right! We'll get justice
Aren't we watching?

253
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:36,507
His boldness cost him his limbs

254
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,842
Who is that man?

255
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:40,469
He was the Inspector before you

256
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:43,347
- The Inspector!?
- Yes!

257
00:28:43,431 --> 00:28:45,766
He said he was going to
seize Big Bro's goods

258
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,184
Big Bro wouldn't take it

259
00:28:47,268 --> 00:28:48,686
He cut off his hand and leg

260
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:02,533
Bring him down

261
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,963
My goods have come
crossing 18 check posts

262
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:17,965
You want to catch that here?

263
00:29:18,132 --> 00:29:19,967
What audacity!!

264
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:23,053
Hey, ask apologize

265
00:29:23,137 --> 00:29:25,973
Say, I will never interfere
in your business ever again...

266
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:27,892
...and then, you can get going

267
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:31,729
Who are you to give me a chance?

268
00:29:31,896 --> 00:29:33,522
I am here to put you behind bars

269
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:35,232
You haven't run
around with a case so far

270
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:36,567
You will now

271
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:40,529
Your threats don't scare me

272
00:29:41,489 --> 00:29:44,992
Tell me
What do we do?

273
00:29:45,242 --> 00:29:49,747
He's come from Madurai, hence such guts

274
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,665
Let's slash a hand
and leg on either side

275
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:01,926
What are you saying Sir?

276
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:04,553
Sir, please stop the Bike

277
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:07,848
- What happened? - Sir, please
stop the Bike, I am feeling dizzy

278
00:30:07,932 --> 00:30:08,933
Let's stop for a cup of Tea

279
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:12,603
You're feeling dizzy already...

280
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:14,355
Two cups of Tea please

281
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:43,300
Mari won't keep quiet
He has started now

282
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:45,803
Who is this Mari?

283
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:47,888
Big Bro's opponent

284
00:30:47,972 --> 00:30:49,640
He was Big Bro's man initially,

285
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:51,559
he has moved away and
runs his own business

286
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:54,311
They are forever clashing

287
00:30:54,979 --> 00:30:58,315
The man who was burnt down in
front of the station was Mari's man

288
00:30:58,399 --> 00:30:59,733
He's not going to stay quiet

289
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:03,070
It will be a riot on the streets

290
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:04,822
No one can walk around safely

291
00:31:05,406 --> 00:31:07,741
Every minute here
spells trouble, let's go

292
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:12,079
Do you see that...
As though he's some achiever

293
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:13,414
He's Mari

294
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:18,085
Do you remember the man who took a
signature from you at the Station?

295
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:19,503
- The Writer...
- Yes...

296
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:22,840
It's been ages since he was happy

297
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:24,174
Why. what happened?

298
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:27,261
On one of the days we chased him...

299
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:30,097
...Mari killed his daughter
right in front of his eyes

300
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,850
Poor guy, he was broken

301
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:35,269
We couldn't do a thing
even though we were Policemen

302
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:38,939
The Police is merely
a dummy in this town

303
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:40,941
Those two men dictate the law here

304
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:44,111
We just have to step
aside and watch their game

305
00:31:44,445 --> 00:31:46,614
For a long while now...

306
00:31:47,448 --> 00:31:51,660
...I've been waiting to welcome...

307
00:31:51,702 --> 00:31:56,040
...a daring Officer who
will stand up to them

308
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:57,958
It hasn't happened so far

309
00:31:58,292 --> 00:32:01,795
Well! No one will agree to
a posting at this Station

310
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:03,297
How did you fall for it?

311
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:21,231
- Where are you?
- I am watching a movie

312
00:32:21,315 --> 00:32:24,151
I see a movie happen
right in front of my eyes...

313
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:25,235
...and you are watching a movie

314
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:27,821
I can't hear you
There's a lot of noise around me

315
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:31,158
I'll call you back myself
Hang up

316
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:32,743
Phew!

317
00:32:34,495 --> 00:32:36,163
He's trapped me like this!

318
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:51,679
Where are you?

319
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:55,933
- Are you enjoying yourself Bro?
- Enjoy??

320
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:58,102
Do you know what kind of place this is?

321
00:32:58,185 --> 00:33:01,271
You've trapped me along with all
the wild animals in the jungle

322
00:33:01,355 --> 00:33:04,274
I don't want this stupid job
I am coming back

323
00:33:04,358 --> 00:33:05,859
Don't worry
I am there

324
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:07,778
<i>You'll be there]! But will I ?</i>

325
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:09,863
Don't get scared
Listen to me

326
00:33:09,947 --> 00:33:12,282
"Don't get scared"?

327
00:33:12,366 --> 00:33:14,618
Listen to me! Hang in there
I am coming

328
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:17,746
Fine! You will come, won't you?

329
00:33:17,788 --> 00:33:19,039
I will

330
00:33:19,123 --> 00:33:20,749
If you don't, I will come there

331
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:23,627
Don't get so tense
I will come there immediately

332
00:33:23,711 --> 00:33:25,212
Please come here...

333
00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:35,973
What's this? Why have they
pushed the kidnapping case to us

334
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:37,474
That's not our jurisdiction

335
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:41,228
They say the Kid's
school falls under our area

336
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:43,981
Obviously, it's Mari who
has kidnapped the child

337
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:46,400
They won't survive if they
interfere in his business

338
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:48,652
Hence, smartly pushed it to us

339
00:33:48,736 --> 00:33:51,780
That's right
But we can't stay away either

340
00:33:51,822 --> 00:33:54,074
They have kidnapped a
Customs officers child

341
00:33:54,158 --> 00:33:57,494
There's a lot of pressure on us,
what do we do?

342
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,592
Come here Thirumurthy

343
00:34:12,426 --> 00:34:15,262
Mari has kidnapped the
Customs Officer's child

344
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:18,265
I am thinking of sending you
Go and rescue the kid

345
00:34:19,183 --> 00:34:20,434
He's caught

346
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:23,270
Everyone told me not to
entrust this to a new guy

347
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:25,439
But I have strongly recommended you

348
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:27,107
Live up to it

349
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:32,029
There, That's confirmation!
Good times are ahead of you

350
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:38,202
- Sir, just a minute...
- He's all churned up

351
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:40,370
Are you happy?

352
00:34:40,454 --> 00:34:42,456
Do you know my first assignment?

353
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:43,832
I have to rescue a kidnapped child

354
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:46,835
You have trapped me like this

355
00:34:46,877 --> 00:34:48,545
Why are you scared? Go ahead

356
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:52,132
What? Do I only have to go?

357
00:34:52,216 --> 00:34:53,634
Do you know who Mari is?

358
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:57,721
Whoever he is, that's not a problem,
listen to me

359
00:34:58,222 --> 00:35:00,724
Don't take anyone with you,
tell them you'll go alone

360
00:35:00,808 --> 00:35:03,143
- What??
- Alone!!?

361
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:05,062
Alone!!?

362
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:07,481
Going Solo?

363
00:35:10,818 --> 00:35:13,904
I am scared, daddy!!
Come and save me

364
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:15,072
Did you hear that

365
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:17,324
Sign the papers and send it across

366
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:19,326
Else, there'll be no
kid to call you "Daddy"

367
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:22,079
We'll butcher her and
send the pieces to you

368
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:23,080
Do you understand?

369
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:32,172
See what that is

370
00:36:08,292 --> 00:36:11,044
- What's that noise there?
- The Police is here

371
00:36:11,712 --> 00:36:15,799
He shouldn't get out alive
What's this new habit!!

372
00:36:57,424 --> 00:36:59,426
Who is it?

373
00:37:38,215 --> 00:37:41,635
Why are you hiding like a girl!!

374
00:37:42,636 --> 00:37:44,304
Come out in the open

375
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:00,904
What happened?

376
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:23,987
Don't beat it like that
It will tear the surface

377
00:39:24,071 --> 00:39:28,241
You've spared the Culprits
But have rounded us up

378
00:39:28,325 --> 00:39:29,576
He's right

379
00:39:29,743 --> 00:39:32,162
Why don't you announce this
to the world outside?

380
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:04,945
Did you crouch so much
only to charge like this?

381
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:09,282
You finished this in a jiffy,
and we hardly felt a thing

382
00:40:09,366 --> 00:40:12,619
You've done this even
without ruffling your uniform

383
00:40:35,976 --> 00:40:39,813
Who is that?
Are you the one?

384
00:40:40,564 --> 00:40:42,816
You haven't just rescued the child...

385
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:44,818
...you have also safeguarded
our reputation

386
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:46,319
Proud of you

387
00:40:46,403 --> 00:40:48,321
You were stubborn about going alone

388
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:50,240
Lions don't hunt in packs

389
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:55,328
I haven't seen a braver Man
in Thoothukudi!!

390
00:40:55,412 --> 00:40:59,416
- Doesn't he resemble me when I was
younger and without a moustache? - Yes Sir

391
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,918
Heard that...

392
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:07,007
...your Father and Grandfather
were Policemen, it runs in your blood

393
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:09,342
You are obviously living up to it

394
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:14,931
No Sir

395
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:19,853
We must learn from him

396
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:24,858
We are singing his praises, yet,
he is so matter of fact about it

397
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:27,277
As if someone else,
and not him, has done all this

398
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,112
- This is the humility you need to learn
- Yes Sir!

399
00:41:29,196 --> 00:41:31,531
This humility
is going to take you places

400
00:41:32,866 --> 00:41:33,783
Give me that

401
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:43,877
It's a sign of Valor, keep it
Bless you

402
00:41:44,794 --> 00:41:47,297
Do you know who gave this to me?

403
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,132
- Tell them
- The old blacksmith...

404
00:41:49,216 --> 00:41:52,552
Why talk about old victories,
let's talk about the new ones...

405
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:57,474
Let's go

406
00:41:57,557 --> 00:42:00,185
Why are you sitting idle?

407
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:02,979
Our boy has done no ordinary thing
Let's hear it for him

408
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:18,745
They are praising me to no end

409
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:22,415
Everyone's admiring me,
celebrating my feat

410
00:42:22,666 --> 00:42:24,834
Enjoy it, be happy

411
00:42:24,918 --> 00:42:27,420
I am kind of scared though

412
00:42:27,504 --> 00:42:30,423
What if they find out
you did this and not me...

413
00:42:30,507 --> 00:42:33,343
I might have to arrest you myself

414
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:38,431
No, they might handcuff us together
and put us in the same Cell

415
00:42:38,515 --> 00:42:40,267
Why are you scaring me like this?

416
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:46,106
We should have been identical twins
like MGR in "Nadodi Manan"

417
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:48,024
No one would have suspected a thing

418
00:42:48,108 --> 00:42:49,526
Why are you scared?

419
00:42:50,193 --> 00:42:53,780
Thiru or Guru
either of us can question injustice

420
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:57,033
"Police" blood runs in both our veins

421
00:42:58,201 --> 00:43:03,290
When Rowdies can hire henchmen
why can't the Police do it?

422
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:04,958
And what did you say...

423
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:08,545
...that this town has got
some dangerous wild animals?

424
00:43:09,379 --> 00:43:11,339
Let's hunt them all down...!

425
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:13,633
I can relax then

426
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:25,812
Brainless guy! Where are you coming from?

427
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:27,564
I just brought the Bike from the Showroom

428
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:29,357
You had to do this right away

429
00:43:29,399 --> 00:43:31,484
Looks like you guys plan this

430
00:43:32,235 --> 00:43:34,362
Am sorry
Why will anyone do this on purpose?

431
00:43:34,404 --> 00:43:36,156
Didn't you do this on purpose?

432
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:38,825
An irritant early in the morning
Are your eyes behind your head?

433
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:40,577
Please listen to me,
I'll get this repaired myself

434
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:41,745
Please move, give me a minute

435
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:43,413
Don't you dare touch the bike,
I'll chop your hands off!

436
00:43:45,415 --> 00:43:49,586
- Gosh! He dropped it again!
- The bike's dented!

437
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:51,004
Get lost! You're dented yourself

438
00:43:52,422 --> 00:43:55,383
Does this even seem right?
You've messed up my new bike!

439
00:43:55,425 --> 00:43:57,177
I just got it from
the showroom this morning

440
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,179
I spent so much time choosing the color

441
00:43:59,262 --> 00:44:01,264
Brainless guy! Pest!!

442
00:44:01,348 --> 00:44:05,101
Hello! I offered to set this right
Please speak respectfully

443
00:44:05,185 --> 00:44:06,519
You don't deserve any respect

444
00:44:06,603 --> 00:44:09,522
No one is going to ceremoniously
garland you for doing this

445
00:44:09,606 --> 00:44:11,107
Should get you caught with the Police

446
00:44:11,191 --> 00:44:12,609
Why are you screaming
at the top of your voice?

447
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:16,613
- The boy is offering to repair it
- You mind your business

448
00:44:16,696 --> 00:44:19,699
He's grown as tall as a Palm Tree,
why don't you question him??

449
00:44:19,783 --> 00:44:20,867
Instead, you're asking me!!

450
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:24,412
You look decent,
but you're saying all the wrong things

451
00:44:24,454 --> 00:44:25,538
I am letting it go cause you're a woman

452
00:44:25,622 --> 00:44:26,790
What if I am a woman?

453
00:44:26,873 --> 00:44:29,626
Do you want me to turn a blind eye
to everything you'll do?

454
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:31,378
What the hell will you do?
What will you do?

455
00:44:32,128 --> 00:44:35,423
Don't use that tone with me
I can do that too...

456
00:44:36,132 --> 00:44:39,636
What can you do?
What will you say to me?

457
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:43,640
Get the hell out of here!!!!

458
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:46,726
How dare you?

459
00:44:49,479 --> 00:44:52,565
See what I do to you
I'll kill you today!!

460
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,985
He is gone already

461
00:44:59,906 --> 00:45:02,492
There's a lot of rowdyism in this place

462
00:45:02,575 --> 00:45:04,828
That is what I said to you
on the phone earlier

463
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:08,248
I am not talking about the men,
women are that way too

464
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:09,249
What are you saying?

465
00:45:09,332 --> 00:45:12,335
I hit a girl's bike by mistake
The way she yelled at me!!

466
00:45:12,419 --> 00:45:15,171
She's no woman
She can speak for three people

467
00:45:15,255 --> 00:45:20,343
My god! Look at what he has done
Why did you let him go?

468
00:45:20,427 --> 00:45:23,513
I had to behave decently in a crowd
I didn't say much

469
00:45:23,596 --> 00:45:27,016
All she needed was a Trident
She's a Killer Goddess!

470
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:29,769
Why were you worried about decency?
You can speak well

471
00:45:29,853 --> 00:45:31,604
Why didn't you cut him to size?

472
00:45:31,688 --> 00:45:37,193
I did give him a piece of my mind
But that's not enough

473
00:45:37,277 --> 00:45:40,864
If I ever see him again,
I'll squash him

474
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:45,952
I kind of managed it, had it been you,
she would have squashed you

475
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:48,204
She has spoken quite a bit

476
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:51,040
Should we book some case against her
and put her behind bars?

477
00:45:51,124 --> 00:45:55,879
Not required! Its best not to deal
with such women in life

478
00:45:55,962 --> 00:45:56,963
Fine then

479
00:45:58,465 --> 00:46:01,134
How can I give
the same number to both of you?

480
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:03,386
What are you saying Sir...
it's my lucky number...

481
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:05,138
That's why I am making a request...

482
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:07,807
If you tell me who it is...
I can speak to that Gentleman...

483
00:46:07,891 --> 00:46:09,642
He's that Gentleman...

484
00:46:20,904 --> 00:46:23,239
Why should I make
a request to strangers...

485
00:46:23,323 --> 00:46:24,657
What are the formalities for this?

486
00:46:24,741 --> 00:46:27,535
I'll pay whatever it takes
and get going...

487
00:46:27,577 --> 00:46:30,914
Sir... I have applied as well...
This is my lucky number

488
00:46:30,997 --> 00:46:33,583
I'll pay any amount,
I need this number

489
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:36,252
I might give in even to my worst enemy,
but not to her

490
00:46:36,336 --> 00:46:37,837
Who is he to give in for me

491
00:46:37,921 --> 00:46:40,757
Please tell me how much
I should pay for it, I will

492
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,176
Can't do anything if both of you
keep fighting like this

493
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:45,345
One of you needs to give in

494
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:55,605
Ok sir!! I've decided to give in

495
00:46:55,688 --> 00:46:59,359
Very good! He has given in
You can take the number

496
00:46:59,442 --> 00:47:01,194
I didn't give in

497
00:47:01,694 --> 00:47:05,448
I made a calculation
The number is summing up to be 13

498
00:47:05,532 --> 00:47:08,785
The devil's number
Will suit her face

499
00:47:08,868 --> 00:47:10,495
- Give it to her!
- Hey stop

500
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:12,372
Who are you calling the devil?

501
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:15,458
What audacity to call me the devil!!

502
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:18,461
You are the devil!!
Why are you running away?

503
00:47:18,628 --> 00:47:20,213
Stop!!

504
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:22,715
- Coward!
- Why are you screaming like the devil?

505
00:47:22,799 --> 00:47:24,801
What? Am I screaming like a devil?

506
00:47:24,884 --> 00:47:28,471
It's all because of him!!
There he goes!

507
00:47:28,555 --> 00:47:29,973
Who is he?

508
00:47:30,056 --> 00:47:33,226
He damaged my bike that day
and today he calls me the devil!!!

509
00:47:33,643 --> 00:47:36,312
Is that him...
I didn't see his face...

510
00:47:36,396 --> 00:47:39,482
If I see his face again,
I'll squash him

511
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:17,103
He bragged about
running his own business

512
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:19,188
Now, they let things slip away!!

513
00:48:19,939 --> 00:48:21,524
Hey Surulai...

514
00:48:21,608 --> 00:48:25,528
...had the same SI interfered in our work,
what would we have done?

515
00:48:25,695 --> 00:48:28,448
We would have cut his hands
and legs and fed the fishes with it

516
00:48:31,701 --> 00:48:33,953
We are working in the Seas...

517
00:48:34,454 --> 00:48:37,874
...would help if he adds
some salt in his food...

518
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:48,217
There's just one Sea at Thoothukudi
and only one Flag can be hoisted here

519
00:48:48,885 --> 00:48:51,554
Did you hear that
You guys blundered

520
00:48:52,972 --> 00:48:56,059
Look at what the big guy is saying
Are you happy now?

521
00:48:56,142 --> 00:48:58,561
- Don't get tense Mari
- What do you mean?

522
00:48:58,645 --> 00:48:59,604
Stay calm

523
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:02,732
Big Bro thinks this Policeman
is just like the guys before him

524
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:06,569
He's no ordinary guy
He's young and fiery

525
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:08,404
He will mess with them
just like he did with us

526
00:49:08,488 --> 00:49:11,240
It will be a blast
Let's step aside and watch the fun

527
00:49:15,995 --> 00:49:17,163
Tell me brother...

528
00:49:17,246 --> 00:49:20,166
Did your brother say anything
about that girl?

529
00:49:20,249 --> 00:49:21,584
He didn't say anything

530
00:49:21,668 --> 00:49:24,420
We've known the family
since your father's times

531
00:49:24,504 --> 00:49:26,339
Wanted him to see the girl
and give us an answer

532
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:29,175
It's been a week and no word yet

533
00:49:29,258 --> 00:49:33,179
Their family says it's a good day today
and want him to go see her

534
00:49:33,262 --> 00:49:34,764
Ask him about it

535
00:49:35,264 --> 00:49:37,767
Is that so? I'll take care of it...

536
00:49:39,936 --> 00:49:41,104
- Bro...
- Yes...

537
00:49:41,187 --> 00:49:42,647
Krishnamurthy just called

538
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:44,857
Shut up!
He doesn't have anything else to do

539
00:49:44,941 --> 00:49:47,193
Why? Don't you want to get married?

540
00:49:47,276 --> 00:49:49,862
You have a job
isn't that the next step?

541
00:49:49,946 --> 00:49:51,197
Get lost!

542
00:49:51,698 --> 00:49:54,117
Do you have your eyes on
any policewoman at the Station?

543
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,284
Shut up

544
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:03,459
What next? Are we going
to cook our meals all our lives

545
00:50:03,543 --> 00:50:06,796
This is the right time
Let's go see her

546
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:08,131
All that's fine

547
00:50:08,214 --> 00:50:11,884
But going to their house won't work for me
I feel shy

548
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:16,556
- Why don't you go and see her?
- Do I have to do this as well?

549
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:18,057
Please...

550
00:50:21,394 --> 00:50:23,980
Why are you sitting like this?
Aren't you ready yet?

551
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:26,566
Why? Don't I look like a girl now?

552
00:50:26,649 --> 00:50:29,777
He can see me the way I am
There's nothing to get ready

553
00:50:29,819 --> 00:50:34,824
The Groom looks superb
Like him at the first sight of him

554
00:50:34,907 --> 00:50:37,827
We don't need to lay down any conditions
He is super!

555
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:39,412
Is that so...

556
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:44,834
Take that eyebrow pencil...

557
00:50:54,844 --> 00:50:57,513
The groom hasn't come
His brother has

558
00:50:59,766 --> 00:51:02,435
If he is fine with the girl,
his brother will be okay too

559
00:51:03,102 --> 00:51:04,020
That's it!!

560
00:51:04,103 --> 00:51:06,439
Even when the groom sees me,
they have a thousand problems

561
00:51:06,522 --> 00:51:08,941
<i>Now one has to see me,
and another has to approve!!</i>

562
00:51:09,025 --> 00:51:10,526
This saree will do for him

563
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:35,635
<i>- Brainless guy!! Pest!!
- Get the hell out of here!!</i>

564
00:51:49,232 --> 00:51:52,652
- What? That girl??
- Thank god, we escaped!

565
00:51:52,735 --> 00:51:55,404
Krishnamurthy would have
got us in to a soup

566
00:51:55,488 --> 00:51:57,490
He's not going to say good things
about me anyway

567
00:51:57,573 --> 00:52:00,868
Am sure he will tell tales
This marriage won't happen

568
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:04,664
You needn't have fought so much
Could have handled it peacefully

569
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:09,335
- No, I think it will work out
- What are you saying?

570
00:52:09,752 --> 00:52:13,339
You said she was a Killer Goddess
She can speak for three...

571
00:52:13,422 --> 00:52:15,341
Yes, I did say that

572
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:19,262
You are a little timid
She's the right one to be by your side

573
00:52:19,345 --> 00:52:22,348
She must have a lot of guts
to speak up in front of so many men

574
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:23,933
She said the right things

575
00:52:24,016 --> 00:52:28,020
I was at fault too! I hit her bike
She can't sweet talk

576
00:52:28,104 --> 00:52:31,941
Can't sweet talk The fault is his
you don't support him

577
00:52:32,024 --> 00:52:35,945
It's different when you see her at home

578
00:52:36,112 --> 00:52:37,446
Is that what you say?

579
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:41,784
The Groom has agreed
They like the girl

580
00:52:41,868 --> 00:52:44,203
They want to know
when to fix the wedding date...

581
00:52:56,549 --> 00:52:59,135
I am going to take a shower
Answer the phone if I get a call

582
00:52:59,218 --> 00:53:00,928
Fine, go ahead dear

583
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:10,938
Why have you changed the soap
You don't listen

584
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:30,416
Granny!!! Answer the phone

585
00:53:31,667 --> 00:53:34,420
She's having a shower
Call back later

586
00:53:55,608 --> 00:53:58,027
When did you come?
There's no one at home

587
00:53:58,110 --> 00:53:59,612
Didn't even give you anything to eat
Granny...

588
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:02,782
That's not required
We've taken a look at everything...

589
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:07,912
seen the date, time, menu...
you look in to whatever you need to

590
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:10,539
There's nothing left for us...
You've looked in to everything...

591
00:54:10,623 --> 00:54:14,126
It's fine, whoever looks in to things
Why differentiate

592
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:16,796
It's one now
We'll look in to it all...

593
00:54:16,879 --> 00:54:18,464
- I'm going
- Fine

594
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:22,468
- You haven't eaten anything
- it's as good as that

595
00:54:22,551 --> 00:54:24,720
- I must thank you specially...
- Why?

596
00:54:24,804 --> 00:54:28,641
You didn't take that argument to heart
and still okayed my sister

597
00:54:28,724 --> 00:54:31,227
- I must thank you too
- For what?

598
00:54:31,477 --> 00:54:33,729
Do you need a reason to say "Thanks"

599
00:54:44,407 --> 00:54:47,243
Why have you been screaming out
for me all along?

600
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:50,746
Granny...One minute...Stay there

601
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:52,832
Come back a bit

602
00:54:53,916 --> 00:54:55,584
Oh My!!! I am finished!!!

603
00:55:09,598 --> 00:55:11,350
Granny, stand right there

604
00:55:12,184 --> 00:55:13,102
Come here

605
00:55:13,185 --> 00:55:14,687
- Why?
- Just come

606
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:16,355
- Why?
- Wrap this towel

607
00:55:16,439 --> 00:55:18,691
- Why are you asking me to do this?
- Nothing, just do it

608
00:55:18,774 --> 00:55:21,277
Move in to that spot and unwrap it
Come

609
00:55:21,527 --> 00:55:24,030
Unwrap it

610
00:55:24,864 --> 00:55:27,450
Gosh!! He saw me!

611
00:55:27,533 --> 00:55:30,536
I should have got it when he kept
talking about looking in to things

612
00:55:30,619 --> 00:55:32,955
He saw me for sure!!!

613
00:56:15,998 --> 00:56:20,586
<i>He is trapped, oh my!</i>

614
00:56:20,753 --> 00:56:25,508
The Bride's there
The Groom '3 here

615
00:56:25,591 --> 00:56:30,096
The heart's on fire

616
00:56:30,262 --> 00:56:34,934
Friends and family will envy this couple

617
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:39,688
They should expect their little one soon

618
00:56:39,772 --> 00:56:44,443
<i>Their eyes meet' shyly</i>

619
00:56:44,527 --> 00:56:46,862
Even amidst all the buzz around them

620
00:56:46,946 --> 00:56:49,281
<i>Their kisses are going to drown
everything else today</i>

621
00:56:54,036 --> 00:56:58,707
<i>She's trapped, oh my!</i>

622
00:56:58,791 --> 00:57:03,462
The Bride's there
The Groom '3 here

623
00:57:03,546 --> 00:57:08,217
The heart's on fire

624
00:57:27,153 --> 00:57:30,823
It seems you didn't
look a girl for me only

625
00:57:31,073 --> 00:57:34,160
Haven't you got ready yet?
Come on

626
00:57:41,083 --> 00:57:46,338
The Sun and Moon should
sing songs to wish them

627
00:57:46,422 --> 00:57:50,676
The Stars should rain blessings on them

628
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:55,848
Shower them with Scented Sandal
and Sacred Vermilion

629
00:57:55,931 --> 00:58:00,436
<i>Give them a few lessons in love</i>

630
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:05,357
Share all the dreams you've had so far

631
00:58:05,441 --> 00:58:09,361
<i>Let kisses heal the little pains of love</i>

632
00:58:09,445 --> 00:58:14,241
This girl is going to A we you

633
00:58:14,283 --> 00:58:20,372
She's going to help you
reach greater heights

634
00:58:28,297 --> 00:58:30,549
- It tastes like laddu
- Don't ogle too much

635
00:58:43,479 --> 00:58:48,317
<i>Lord Vishnu, surrounded
by a 1000 elephants</i>

636
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:57,826
strode majestically in a town
decorated with

637
00:58:57,910 --> 00:59:07,086
streamers and golden pots
in the background...

638
00:59:16,345 --> 00:59:18,681
<i>There's no trick nor plot</i>

639
00:59:18,764 --> 00:59:21,433
They take turns to steal a glance

640
00:59:21,517 --> 00:59:25,854
<i>They crumble in their</i>
<i>love struck gaze...</i>

641
00:59:25,938 --> 00:59:31,026
There's no shine, no rain
Yet, a Rainbow blossoms

642
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:35,698
<i>The heart' is splashed with color</i>

643
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:40,536
A /one Anklet is aflutter like a Top

644
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:44,540
And this Heart's leaping in tandem

645
00:59:44,623 --> 00:59:49,336
Need no words to describe your love

646
00:59:49,378 --> 00:59:51,714
Your glance will do

647
00:59:51,797 --> 00:59:54,967
Don't you change the way you look at me

648
01:00:07,313 --> 01:00:12,067
<i>Their eyes meet' shyly</i>

649
01:00:12,151 --> 01:00:16,822
Even amidst all the buzz around them

650
01:00:16,905 --> 01:00:21,577
<i>Their eyes meet' shyly</i>

651
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:26,415
Even amidst all the buzz around them

652
01:01:01,784 --> 01:01:03,535
What are you doing here?

653
01:01:03,619 --> 01:01:05,454
I am going to sleep
I need a mat and a pillow

654
01:01:06,205 --> 01:01:08,040
Don't make noise
They are in the next room

655
01:01:08,123 --> 01:01:09,291
Irresponsible people!

656
01:01:09,375 --> 01:01:12,294
Granny's coming! What will she think
if she sees us together?

657
01:01:12,378 --> 01:01:15,214
The wedding is over
Why are you hassled?

658
01:01:15,297 --> 01:01:17,966
Your talking as though our wedding is over

659
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:20,052
It's your brother who is married

660
01:01:20,135 --> 01:01:22,054
- Jayanthi!!!
- Do something

661
01:01:22,137 --> 01:01:24,640
- Come! - Everyone has vanished
after the wedding...

662
01:01:24,723 --> 01:01:26,725
...I have to take care of everything!!

663
01:01:27,476 --> 01:01:31,897
Thank god, if this were silver,
someone would have stolen it

664
01:02:00,259 --> 01:02:03,345
The Groom seems to be quite something!!!

665
01:02:13,689 --> 01:02:15,691
Must thank your Granny...

666
01:02:20,362 --> 01:02:21,530
Yeah right!!

667
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:32,458
Stop! Get down!

668
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:34,960
Watch out

669
01:02:35,544 --> 01:02:41,467
Hold the handle!

670
01:02:47,890 --> 01:02:52,519
Yeah right!! Are you happy?
Why are you after it?

671
01:02:53,312 --> 01:02:54,897
You waited it out to do this

672
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:57,649
He did it
Lift it!

673
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:03,822
Nice, even my room looks good

674
01:03:03,906 --> 01:03:06,408
That is why we need women at home

675
01:03:06,742 --> 01:03:09,411
This is not for you
This is for Granny and me

676
01:03:09,495 --> 01:03:12,414
Oh! So you have arrived
as a family package...

677
01:03:12,498 --> 01:03:16,585
I thought this was a temporary visit
Is this a permanent one?

678
01:03:16,668 --> 01:03:17,586
Yes!

679
01:03:17,669 --> 01:03:21,173
Now, don't sit this close to me
Granny is inside

680
01:03:21,256 --> 01:03:22,090
Goon

681
01:03:23,008 --> 01:03:27,513
You guys have come and dislocated us...

682
01:03:28,263 --> 01:03:29,598
Watch out

683
01:03:29,681 --> 01:03:32,017
Keep it downstairs
Why are you sending that upstairs

684
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:34,269
Let's keep it on top
Listen to me!

685
01:03:34,353 --> 01:03:36,355
- Go
- He doesn't listen to me

686
01:03:36,438 --> 01:03:38,690
- Okay, come
- Come...come

687
01:03:38,774 --> 01:03:41,443
Hey, what happened
Did it fit there?

688
01:03:42,444 --> 01:03:46,532
- No, it didn't, take it down
- I told you so

689
01:03:47,783 --> 01:03:48,867
One minute

690
01:03:50,536 --> 01:03:52,454
- Is he younger to you?
- Why?

691
01:03:52,538 --> 01:03:54,289
He's older than me by two years

692
01:03:54,790 --> 01:03:57,626
There seems to be no
respect in your tone and manner

693
01:03:57,709 --> 01:03:59,461
That's how it's been since childhood

694
01:03:59,545 --> 01:04:02,047
That was fine as a child
But now he is married

695
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:03,465
Talk to him with respect

696
01:04:03,549 --> 01:04:08,303
Even if you don't respect his age,
give it to him for the post he holds

697
01:04:09,638 --> 01:04:11,390
One has to teach you respect

698
01:04:11,473 --> 01:04:14,476
You were someone who
raised your voice on me outside

699
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:16,979
That was when I didn't know you

700
01:04:19,982 --> 01:04:22,818
- What are you doing?
- Nothing much

701
01:04:23,986 --> 01:04:25,320
"Nothing"?

702
01:04:25,404 --> 01:04:27,489
Why are you so proud of it?

703
01:04:27,823 --> 01:04:29,491
If you stay this way,
you cannot do a thing

704
01:04:29,575 --> 01:04:31,827
Don't think you can
relax like this forever

705
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:32,911
Look at finding a job for yourself

706
01:04:32,995 --> 01:04:36,248
- How can I follow you if two
people speak at the same time? - What?

707
01:04:45,007 --> 01:04:49,094
What's up Inspector?
You acted smart with us

708
01:04:50,178 --> 01:04:52,347
Big Bro's goods are on the move today...

709
01:04:52,431 --> 01:04:54,433
...why don't you try
showing your bravery there

710
01:05:00,105 --> 01:05:03,942
It's about the goods, isn't it?
Got four calls since morning

711
01:05:04,026 --> 01:05:06,028
No one is acknowledging the call

712
01:05:06,111 --> 01:05:08,530
Everyone is scared
cause it involves Big Bro

713
01:05:08,614 --> 01:05:11,366
You won't spare them I'm sure...

714
01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:13,118
...they are going to be
beaten black and blue

715
01:05:13,869 --> 01:05:15,787
Are you going alone even this time?

716
01:05:36,141 --> 01:05:39,978
Who is that lying down
in the middle of the road?

717
01:05:40,062 --> 01:05:43,315
Is he drunk?
Check it out

718
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:03,789
What are you saying?

719
01:08:07,793 --> 01:08:09,294
Are you even a big Rowdy?

720
01:08:10,045 --> 01:08:11,546
You've just let it slip away

721
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:13,840
Do you know the value of the goods?

722
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:18,720
Who is he?

723
01:08:21,223 --> 01:08:22,474
What's up Big Bro?

724
01:08:22,724 --> 01:08:26,978
Everyone in town is
only talking about you

725
01:08:27,062 --> 01:08:29,648
I believe the new SI
has seized the goods

726
01:08:29,731 --> 01:08:34,069
The boys don't seem to know
the real value of the goods

727
01:08:34,152 --> 01:08:36,154
You claimed you would feed him...

728
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:38,907
...to the fishes if he dared
to interfere in your work!!

729
01:08:39,741 --> 01:08:41,910
You haven't done a thing so far!

730
01:08:43,328 --> 01:08:44,871
The Rascal!

731
01:08:46,498 --> 01:08:50,168
Did you hear that?
He's offering his condolence

732
01:08:51,253 --> 01:08:52,754
He's laughing at us

733
01:08:52,838 --> 01:08:55,173
Does that Policeman have horns??

734
01:08:56,758 --> 01:08:59,678
I underestimated him
and let it slip away

735
01:08:59,761 --> 01:09:01,429
He seems to be quite a guy!

736
01:09:01,847 --> 01:09:04,099
His father and
grandfather were Policemen

737
01:09:04,182 --> 01:09:08,353
He's arrogant cause he's
got that blood in him

738
01:09:12,566 --> 01:09:14,484
Are you singing his praises to me?

739
01:09:36,923 --> 01:09:38,175
What shall we do?

740
01:09:41,511 --> 01:09:43,138
He has interfered in our business

741
01:09:44,014 --> 01:09:47,559
We'll do something for sure
We must scare him

742
01:09:50,729 --> 01:09:52,397
Who are the people with him?

743
01:09:54,357 --> 01:09:55,942
What's his weakness?

744
01:09:56,401 --> 01:10:01,239
The boys say he has a brother
He hangs around idly

745
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:02,991
Should we get him

746
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:13,001
Get him!!

747
01:10:19,341 --> 01:10:21,426
How can I eat the
whole chicken by myself?

748
01:10:21,801 --> 01:10:26,806
When you can do so much by yourself,
can't you eat this?

749
01:10:27,265 --> 01:10:30,602
You seized Big Bro's goods
single handedly...

750
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:35,857
Heard about it
Please eat

751
01:10:41,488 --> 01:10:43,990
You're all set to eat
early in the morning...

752
01:10:44,074 --> 01:10:45,784
...are you leaving
for a Central Government job?

753
01:10:45,909 --> 01:10:50,288
You've eaten already, are you
heading for a job in State Bank?

754
01:10:50,872 --> 01:10:54,084
He has a retort for everything

755
01:10:54,334 --> 01:10:56,878
The whole town is talking about you

756
01:10:57,045 --> 01:11:00,674
They say the new SI
is doing a great job

757
01:11:01,132 --> 01:11:04,135
We were so happy to hear that

758
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:09,140
Please eat

759
01:11:18,650 --> 01:11:23,405
Please don't eat that brother in law
I've made this specially for you, try it

760
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:26,408
How can I eat two whole chickens
Why are you doing this?

761
01:11:26,491 --> 01:11:28,493
It's fine
Please go ahead

762
01:11:29,286 --> 01:11:30,203
All right

763
01:11:34,916 --> 01:11:37,294
- Nice!
- That's why I wanted you to eat it

764
01:11:47,095 --> 01:11:48,096
When did you come?

765
01:11:48,179 --> 01:11:50,223
I came when you've were
munching on the second chicken

766
01:11:50,598 --> 01:11:53,727
- Haven't you eaten yet?
- I can't eat an empty plate

767
01:11:54,019 --> 01:11:55,353
Weren't you served anything?

768
01:11:55,437 --> 01:11:57,188
Only if you leave
something behind for me

769
01:11:58,064 --> 01:11:59,316
Shouldn't talk while we eat

770
01:11:59,482 --> 01:12:01,276
That's for those who eat

771
01:12:02,027 --> 01:12:05,864
- I can't eat anymore
- This is not for you, it's for me

772
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:09,242
I am getting late for work

773
01:12:10,493 --> 01:12:12,954
I am done

774
01:12:14,956 --> 01:12:16,291
I must hurry up

775
01:12:16,541 --> 01:12:20,712
- Your sister...
- Where?

776
01:12:36,436 --> 01:12:38,021
That's a nice piece of "Leg"

777
01:12:40,148 --> 01:12:41,566
Can I get the other?

778
01:12:41,941 --> 01:12:44,360
Jayanthi! I've packed lunch for you

779
01:12:44,444 --> 01:12:45,695
Make sure you take it when you leave

780
01:12:45,779 --> 01:12:47,405
We are going to get caught by sister

781
01:12:50,075 --> 01:12:51,242
Quite something, isn't it?

782
01:13:07,634 --> 01:13:11,763
Hey! Wait!
Buy all of this quick

783
01:13:12,347 --> 01:13:14,432
Don't roam around
Come back fast

784
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:18,186
What's that brother?

785
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:20,105
This is for you to
gobble in the afternoon!!

786
01:13:39,666 --> 01:13:40,708
What happened? Where are you guys?

787
01:13:40,792 --> 01:13:43,044
We are following him
He's in the jeep

788
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:44,671
His brother is with him

789
01:13:45,213 --> 01:13:47,215
Don't touch him when he is
with his brother, He's a "Terror"

790
01:13:47,632 --> 01:13:50,093
- Fine!
- See if you can catch him alone

791
01:13:50,385 --> 01:13:51,344
Sure

792
01:14:17,745 --> 01:14:19,122
Hey! Stop there

793
01:14:20,623 --> 01:14:21,583
Stop! Bye

794
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:23,501
I'll see you

795
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:35,388
Poor you

796
01:14:37,599 --> 01:14:39,893
Please stop

797
01:14:50,236 --> 01:14:52,864
Some one has run over this poor thing

798
01:14:52,947 --> 01:14:54,699
I'll get off at the hospital on the way

799
01:15:06,377 --> 01:15:08,004
What happened? Did you get that dog?

800
01:15:08,296 --> 01:15:11,758
That dog's got in with a dog

801
01:15:13,301 --> 01:15:17,055
He has walked right into our trap

802
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:19,766
We're on our way

803
01:15:20,725 --> 01:15:22,060
Bring him

804
01:15:23,645 --> 01:15:25,104
That Left

805
01:15:29,901 --> 01:15:31,778
The Right

806
01:15:35,406 --> 01:15:38,743
This Left
This Left Bro

807
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:40,537
Can you just shut up?

808
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:43,665
We're coming to the Godown
He's with us

809
01:15:43,831 --> 01:15:45,208
We'll be there in five minutes

810
01:16:19,617 --> 01:16:21,244
Make a call to that Policeman

811
01:16:26,291 --> 01:16:30,003
Hey Policeman! You seized my goods

812
01:16:30,878 --> 01:16:33,881
Your brother is with me now

813
01:16:34,882 --> 01:16:36,718
I want my goods out

814
01:16:36,843 --> 01:16:43,016
Else your brother will
be chopped in to pieces

815
01:16:43,433 --> 01:16:46,603
You'll have to pick up what is left
Do you get that?

816
01:17:02,827 --> 01:17:06,998
He's undeterred even when
they have his brother captive

817
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:08,625
Duty comes first to him

818
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:11,711
That doesn't mean
he should be stone hearted

819
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:14,631
He's quite a guy!!

820
01:17:18,593 --> 01:17:20,303
There's no controlling him

821
01:17:21,179 --> 01:17:24,015
He wouldn't have interfered
if he had brains

822
01:17:25,683 --> 01:17:27,935
He will be scared only
if he sees some bloodshed

823
01:17:28,436 --> 01:17:31,356
- Surulai!!
- Brother!! Listen to me

824
01:17:31,481 --> 01:17:37,028
Let me speak to my brother just once
He'll listen to me

825
01:17:37,195 --> 01:17:39,614
Your brother should have this fear

826
01:17:41,449 --> 01:17:42,784
Make a call to him

827
01:17:48,539 --> 01:17:52,877
I am scared, brother
It's dark all over

828
01:17:53,169 --> 01:17:57,507
Have Rowdies around me...

829
01:17:58,841 --> 01:18:02,095
Please come in ten minutes

830
01:18:04,514 --> 01:18:06,307
Did you hear that?

831
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:11,312
You will see him dead if you don't come

832
01:18:20,113 --> 01:18:21,656
Those guys are dangerous

833
01:18:21,864 --> 01:18:23,491
They can do anything to him

834
01:18:23,825 --> 01:18:28,579
Should I ask for a Special Force?

835
01:18:33,209 --> 01:18:35,461
What's wrong with you?
He's a big Force himself

836
01:18:35,586 --> 01:18:38,715
He got worked up with your offer

837
01:18:39,132 --> 01:18:42,510
If he's silent, that only means
he's got some violent plan in mind

838
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:48,766
I don't think that Policeman will
succumb to any sibling attachments

839
01:18:49,142 --> 01:18:50,476
He won't come

840
01:18:51,018 --> 01:18:55,106
Cut his thumb off and
send it to him as a sample

841
01:18:55,606 --> 01:18:58,818
Brother!! Please don't

842
01:18:58,901 --> 01:19:01,654
Please don't

843
01:19:03,698 --> 01:19:06,492
Oh god! My finger!

844
01:19:21,174 --> 01:19:22,884
Think they've done it

845
01:19:23,009 --> 01:19:24,260
Do you want to stay back and watch?

846
01:19:24,677 --> 01:19:26,179
No, no, you stay back and watch it

847
01:19:32,143 --> 01:19:35,271
Told you to watch your finger!

848
01:19:39,317 --> 01:19:40,568
Beat him up!

849
01:20:34,539 --> 01:20:37,250
You shouldn't miss even a single target

850
01:20:41,212 --> 01:20:44,799
This is how you beat up people

851
01:21:00,481 --> 01:21:03,734
Don't!

852
01:21:03,860 --> 01:21:04,861
Don't you want it

853
01:21:06,821 --> 01:21:09,073
I do...!

854
01:21:42,607 --> 01:21:44,442
Wasn't that a good punch!

855
01:21:49,697 --> 01:21:51,282
Come on!

856
01:22:12,094 --> 01:22:15,181
Sir, am calling from the Bank,
we 're offering an account...

857
01:22:15,264 --> 01:22:18,392
I am closing up an account now
Call me later

858
01:22:44,710 --> 01:22:45,378
Tell me

859
01:22:45,461 --> 01:22:48,422
He's wreaking havoc!

860
01:22:48,547 --> 01:22:51,175
He's got the same force
It's in his blood too

861
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:54,428
The brothers are equally
bad in beating people up

862
01:23:22,081 --> 01:23:22,957
I am so proud of you

863
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:25,668
They held your brother captive,
but you didn't give in

864
01:23:25,751 --> 01:23:27,169
You've kept the seized goods intact

865
01:23:27,294 --> 01:23:29,005
You are a true Policeman!

866
01:23:29,422 --> 01:23:32,591
- I see no fear in your eyes!!
- I see a fire in his eyes!

867
01:23:32,675 --> 01:23:34,218
That's right

868
01:23:34,343 --> 01:23:38,472
We can clean up Thoothukudi
with more people like you

869
01:23:38,556 --> 01:23:41,058
You are not someone
meant for ordinary tasks,

870
01:23:41,267 --> 01:23:42,727
you should be doing greater things

871
01:23:42,893 --> 01:23:45,479
If you hand over the goods in Court...

872
01:23:45,563 --> 01:23:49,275
I am sure you'll become the
Superintendent of the Anti smuggling wing

873
01:23:49,567 --> 01:23:50,317
Give it to me

874
01:23:53,446 --> 01:23:54,405
It's missing Sir

875
01:24:02,913 --> 01:24:08,294
He's going to hand over the goods
in the Tirunelveli Court tomorrow

876
01:24:10,171 --> 01:24:12,882
I don't know what you'll do, the goods
shouldn't reach the Court tomorrow

877
01:26:16,213 --> 01:26:17,715
Why did you burn all the goods?

878
01:26:18,174 --> 01:26:20,676
I've said I will hand them
over at the Tirunelveli Court

879
01:26:20,801 --> 01:26:21,927
What do we do now?

880
01:26:22,052 --> 01:26:23,971
Am I a fool to burn it?

881
01:26:24,972 --> 01:26:27,558
- All the goods are in the Train
- What are you saying?

882
01:26:27,683 --> 01:26:29,518
- Come
- Where?

883
01:26:32,938 --> 01:26:34,064
When did you load this?

884
01:26:34,148 --> 01:26:37,651
I got this in even before
their men got in to the Train

885
01:26:37,985 --> 01:26:39,570
Super Brother!!

886
01:26:40,988 --> 01:26:42,907
- Super Brother!!
- Way to go!!

887
01:26:50,206 --> 01:26:51,874
You slipped up!!!

888
01:26:52,708 --> 01:26:55,169
He has handed it over in Court

889
01:26:55,252 --> 01:26:58,839
He loaded the goods even
before our men got in to the Train

890
01:27:01,050 --> 01:27:04,887
He's not just strong,
he's intelligent as well

891
01:27:05,137 --> 01:27:07,389
It's pointless to confront him

892
01:27:10,351 --> 01:27:13,062
He's playing a different game

893
01:27:14,021 --> 01:27:16,857
We should play it differently too

894
01:27:25,866 --> 01:27:27,284
How are you?

895
01:27:27,534 --> 01:27:28,702
Hope you are doing well

896
01:27:29,036 --> 01:27:30,496
You are from my hometown...

897
01:27:30,746 --> 01:27:32,665
You've seen me since childhood

898
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:34,667
Won't you tell him about me...?

899
01:27:35,501 --> 01:27:37,211
He's married to a girl from my town,

900
01:27:37,795 --> 01:27:41,048
hence have made a decision

901
01:27:42,633 --> 01:27:46,262
He didn't seize my goods,
nor did I load them

902
01:27:46,512 --> 01:27:48,472
Surulai, keep it there
Keep it

903
01:27:50,975 --> 01:27:58,524
Starting today, I will send in a
share each time my goods move place

904
01:27:58,649 --> 01:28:00,734
- What Surulai?
- Get up!

905
01:28:02,027 --> 01:28:02,778
I said get up!

906
01:28:02,945 --> 01:28:04,363
Do you know who you're talking to?

907
01:28:09,243 --> 01:28:10,953
Who are you trying to buy?

908
01:28:11,412 --> 01:28:13,497
You've not met a real man before this

909
01:28:14,164 --> 01:28:17,501
If any one stood up to you,
you've always transferred them...

910
01:28:17,584 --> 01:28:20,212
Or chopped their hands
or legs off... or burnt them

911
01:28:20,296 --> 01:28:22,006
isn't that what you do?

912
01:28:22,881 --> 01:28:27,678
Now that a man is ready to
confront you, are you scared?

913
01:28:27,761 --> 01:28:31,056
Face him head on, if you are a real Man

914
01:28:31,348 --> 01:28:34,601
Instead, you are here to strike a
bargain and bring him to your side

915
01:28:35,644 --> 01:28:40,232
If he even sees this, he'll
shoot you like you were little birds...

916
01:28:40,316 --> 01:28:46,030
There's no guarantee for your life,
if you stay here a minute longer

917
01:28:46,113 --> 01:28:47,865
Leave this place right away!

918
01:28:53,871 --> 01:28:55,039
Go!

919
01:29:13,682 --> 01:29:16,518
When did you come?
Were you listening to everything?

920
01:29:16,602 --> 01:29:20,647
Did I play the part of a
Policeman's wife well?

921
01:29:21,690 --> 01:29:23,275
The whole place is scared of him

922
01:29:23,567 --> 01:29:27,071
Won't I be happy when a man
like him is scared of you...?

923
01:29:28,572 --> 01:29:30,074
Let's eat

924
01:29:33,035 --> 01:29:35,329
What we burnt was not crackers

925
01:29:35,412 --> 01:29:37,998
What you saw flare up in front of you
That is the real one

926
01:29:38,123 --> 01:29:39,333
You don't need anyone else

927
01:29:39,416 --> 01:29:42,503
Your wife is more than enough for you
Enjoy Brother!

928
01:29:44,296 --> 01:29:46,673
Did you need this Bro?

929
01:29:47,299 --> 01:29:50,677
A man of your stature, shouldn't
have come down to speak to her

930
01:29:51,512 --> 01:29:54,098
A woman has the cheek to say so much

931
01:29:56,141 --> 01:29:59,269
You think I am a fool to try
and make peace without a reason

932
01:30:00,020 --> 01:30:04,400
He's not my relative for me to
visit him with a basket of fruits

933
01:30:06,068 --> 01:30:08,612
He's not the only one who
can play with Fireworks

934
01:30:08,695 --> 01:30:11,865
We've bought our fireworks
from the same place he bought his

935
01:30:11,949 --> 01:30:14,118
Ours will blow up too!

936
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:25,712
- Hey!! Stop the Vehicle!!!
- What happened?

937
01:30:25,963 --> 01:30:27,047
Get off and run!!

938
01:30:46,608 --> 01:30:48,777
We left the Fruit basket there, how
did it get back in to the Vehicle?

939
01:30:48,861 --> 01:30:51,864
I brought it back
since the deal didn't work

940
01:30:52,739 --> 01:30:55,451
Bro. please!!!

941
01:31:01,623 --> 01:31:03,834
You are the Inspector for the
Anti smuggling wing from today

942
01:31:03,917 --> 01:31:04,877
Best of Luck!

943
01:31:09,715 --> 01:31:11,091
Start off the new Hunt!!

944
01:31:17,723 --> 01:31:19,683
- Tell me Sister in Law...
- Has the groom come?

945
01:31:19,766 --> 01:31:21,560
Not yet, waiting for him

946
01:31:21,643 --> 01:31:23,896
Don't get distracted
and miss his arrival

947
01:31:24,897 --> 01:31:27,483
He's coming back from
the US after a long while

948
01:31:27,941 --> 01:31:30,152
This is the first time
I am entrusting a job to you

949
01:31:30,235 --> 01:31:32,404
- Don't mess it up
- Fine!

950
01:31:32,946 --> 01:31:36,366
And if he asks you about Jayanti,
don't you blabber something

951
01:31:36,825 --> 01:31:38,285
Let him find out in person

952
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:41,038
- Do you get that?
- Yes

953
01:31:50,297 --> 01:31:51,548
Welcome Bridegroom!

954
01:31:51,632 --> 01:31:53,800
How did you find out
that I was the Groom?

955
01:31:53,884 --> 01:31:55,928
Have seen so many such
"Grooms from America" in Films,

956
01:31:56,011 --> 01:31:57,638
you're just like one of them

957
01:31:58,639 --> 01:32:01,058
I saw Jayanti when she was a kid
How does she look now?

958
01:32:01,141 --> 01:32:04,144
She looks gorgeous
Can keep looking at her

959
01:32:05,729 --> 01:32:07,606
You describe her well
Goon

960
01:32:07,689 --> 01:32:11,276
Light weight, just the right height...

961
01:32:12,110 --> 01:32:16,073
- Will our match be good?
- It will Rock!

962
01:32:21,453 --> 01:32:23,872
- Gautham, how are you?
- Am good

963
01:32:23,956 --> 01:32:26,542
How are your parents?
Come in

964
01:32:27,501 --> 01:32:30,170
- Granny!
- Hey Granny!!

965
01:32:31,672 --> 01:32:34,800
Granny, do you remember him,
that's Gautham, our neighbour

966
01:32:34,883 --> 01:32:37,970
isn't he the guy who used
to roam around in Shorts?

967
01:32:38,512 --> 01:32:40,222
He's roaming around in Shorts even now

968
01:32:40,264 --> 01:32:41,306
Please come

969
01:32:44,518 --> 01:32:46,311
This is Gautham, the groom

970
01:32:49,856 --> 01:32:51,650
What are you looking at?
Don't you know who she is?

971
01:32:51,733 --> 01:32:52,901
This is our Jayanti

972
01:32:52,985 --> 01:32:55,028
Can't identify her, can you?

973
01:32:55,112 --> 01:32:58,115
- Do you remember her?
- Sort of

974
01:32:58,740 --> 01:33:01,577
We've known him since childhood
They were our neighbors

975
01:33:01,868 --> 01:33:04,288
He settled down in
America after his college

976
01:33:04,413 --> 01:33:06,290
He's a green card holder

977
01:33:07,749 --> 01:33:12,588
- Do you know his monthly salary?
- Just Ten Lakhs

978
01:33:14,131 --> 01:33:17,009
Listen to that
Can you even imagine?

979
01:33:17,801 --> 01:33:18,719
Not possible

980
01:33:18,844 --> 01:33:20,887
Do you like her Gautham?

981
01:33:23,015 --> 01:33:25,475
- How is the groom?
- Good!

982
01:33:26,268 --> 01:33:27,394
Very good!

983
01:33:27,477 --> 01:33:28,895
He's my selection!

984
01:33:28,979 --> 01:33:30,897
Can we go ahead with
the same wedding date?

985
01:33:32,899 --> 01:33:34,026
Just a minute please

986
01:33:34,109 --> 01:33:37,070
You've agreed on this
after speaking to my parents

987
01:33:37,154 --> 01:33:40,532
The reason I've come
here fifteen days ahead is,

988
01:33:40,616 --> 01:33:45,621
We need to understand each
other before the wedding

989
01:33:47,372 --> 01:33:48,665
What should we do Gautham?

990
01:33:49,499 --> 01:33:52,419
An outing, some dating, a meeting,

991
01:33:52,502 --> 01:33:56,465
only then can I get fixed on this

992
01:33:56,548 --> 01:33:59,092
No problem, take her wherever you want

993
01:33:59,176 --> 01:34:01,637
In fact, this guy has
nothing better to do

994
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:05,223
He knows all the places here
Use him to take you around

995
01:34:05,307 --> 01:34:08,060
Good! We can go anywhere
Am ready!

996
01:34:08,185 --> 01:34:09,770
Let's leave

997
01:34:14,483 --> 01:34:19,071
I know an awesome place here
The best place for couples

998
01:34:19,321 --> 01:34:21,907
Very scenic
Very cool

999
01:34:21,990 --> 01:34:26,953
You're talking like an expert in love
Take us to that place!!

1000
01:34:27,579 --> 01:34:30,207
I think a week is too much time

1001
01:34:30,582 --> 01:34:34,920
Just this trip will do for
your chemistry to fall in place

1002
01:34:35,003 --> 01:34:40,634
- You can take her to America after that
- Correct!

1003
01:34:40,717 --> 01:34:44,221
Are you playing around?
Is that true?

1004
01:34:45,305 --> 01:34:48,308
Your brother says "Good"
you are saying "Very Good"

1005
01:34:49,184 --> 01:34:51,561
Should I marry him and
settle down in America?

1006
01:34:53,814 --> 01:34:57,359
He looks like an ugly bird
Should I marry him?

1007
01:34:57,442 --> 01:34:58,902
What's that?

1008
01:34:58,985 --> 01:35:00,737
Don't you have a place
for me in your heart?

1009
01:35:02,948 --> 01:35:04,116
Holding hands...

1010
01:35:04,199 --> 01:35:06,284
Playing with my feet...
were those moments not true?

1011
01:35:06,368 --> 01:35:08,745
You held each other's hands...?
Playing with her feet?

1012
01:35:10,747 --> 01:35:13,709
I am talking here and
you're just driving the car!!

1013
01:35:40,068 --> 01:35:43,655
Hug me my dear...

1014
01:35:43,739 --> 01:35:47,993
You're a thorn less Rose plant'

1015
01:35:48,076 --> 01:35:51,830
Let me go, touch me

1016
01:35:51,913 --> 01:35:56,042
This is a Hunt with a Bow...

1017
01:35:56,126 --> 01:35:59,546
You're a flower that changes color

1018
01:35:59,629 --> 01:36:03,759
I'll take you without plucking you away

1019
01:36:04,092 --> 01:36:07,596
You 're the undying fire

1020
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:12,058
I'll embrace you without putting you out

1021
01:36:12,142 --> 01:36:15,937
My eyes are celebrating

1022
01:36:16,021 --> 01:36:20,066
She '.9 Walked in to
the corner of my heart

1023
01:36:20,150 --> 01:36:23,987
My eyes are celebrating

1024
01:36:24,070 --> 01:36:28,033
She '.9 Walked in to
the corner of my heart

1025
01:36:28,116 --> 01:36:31,828
Hug me my dear...

1026
01:36:31,912 --> 01:36:36,041
<i>I am the thorn less Rose plant'</i>

1027
01:36:36,124 --> 01:36:39,878
Let me go, touch me

1028
01:36:39,961 --> 01:36:44,216
I am the blooming
plant even if you let me go

1029
01:37:15,956 --> 01:37:20,126
Speak to me sweetly my dear
Kill me softly

1030
01:37:20,210 --> 01:37:23,839
I am restless because of you

1031
01:37:24,214 --> 01:37:26,132
Soar like a Lion

1032
01:37:26,216 --> 01:37:28,134
Slice me up like slabs of gold

1033
01:37:28,218 --> 01:37:31,638
I'll give you what you want,
let your eyes ask me

1034
01:37:31,721 --> 01:37:34,182
I am the ”orange” cloud of hope

1035
01:37:34,266 --> 01:37:39,855
to the blooming flower
to the lonely island

1036
01:37:39,938 --> 01:37:44,109
Let's join hands and go
to the untraveled lands

1037
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:47,863
to the mean forests

1038
01:37:48,071 --> 01:37:50,115
His words and deeds are making

1039
01:37:50,198 --> 01:37:56,162
<i>my heart flutter like a Kite...</i>

1040
01:37:56,288 --> 01:38:00,083
My eyes are celebrating

1041
01:38:00,166 --> 01:38:03,962
She '.9 Walked in to
the corner of my heart

1042
01:38:04,045 --> 01:38:08,091
My eyes are celebrating

1043
01:38:08,174 --> 01:38:12,345
She '.9 Walked in to
the corner of my heart

1044
01:38:44,210 --> 01:38:48,173
Will <i>these kisses do
Would you need another</i>

1045
01:38:48,256 --> 01:38:51,927
<i>Tell me the cheek I must kiss
What else do you need</i>

1046
01:38:52,218 --> 01:38:54,262
Do you need to ask me

1047
01:38:54,346 --> 01:38:56,264
Will your lips seek
permission to touch...

1048
01:38:56,348 --> 01:38:59,809
<i>Hug me tight, I am your dearest...</i>

1049
01:38:59,893 --> 01:39:04,272
<i>Hey, when you call me sweetly
I can only say yes to all you want</i>

1050
01:39:04,356 --> 01:39:07,734
I feel intoxicated inside of me

1051
01:39:07,817 --> 01:39:10,236
As you leap beautifully,

1052
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:12,238
<i>the unacquainted
little child that you are...</i>

1053
01:39:12,322 --> 01:39:15,992
My head goes dizzy with this new high

1054
01:39:16,076 --> 01:39:20,330
His words and deeds are making

1055
01:39:20,413 --> 01:39:24,209
<i>my heart flutter like a Kite...</i>

1056
01:39:24,292 --> 01:39:27,879
Hug me my dear...

1057
01:39:27,963 --> 01:39:32,092
You're a thorn less Rose plant'

1058
01:39:32,175 --> 01:39:36,012
Let me go, touch me

1059
01:39:36,096 --> 01:39:40,225
This is a Hunt with a Bow...

1060
01:39:40,308 --> 01:39:43,770
You're a flower that changes color

1061
01:39:43,853 --> 01:39:48,400
I'll take you without plucking you away

1062
01:40:06,793 --> 01:40:10,088
Hello!! Hello!! There's no signal here

1063
01:40:11,589 --> 01:40:13,550
What's happening here?

1064
01:40:13,633 --> 01:40:16,052
An open place, you said
there would be no people here

1065
01:40:16,136 --> 01:40:18,763
Did you say all this was for you?

1066
01:40:19,723 --> 01:40:23,018
Have I come all the way from the US
to marry a girl someone else likes?

1067
01:40:23,893 --> 01:40:27,105
You said she was gorgeous,
she's like candy

1068
01:40:27,272 --> 01:40:30,191
I should have had my doubts even then

1069
01:40:30,650 --> 01:40:32,444
Hey you!!! Just you wait

1070
01:40:32,527 --> 01:40:35,530
I am going to tell
people at home about this

1071
01:40:35,613 --> 01:40:37,240
I will!

1072
01:40:37,323 --> 01:40:40,035
- Hey!! One minute!!
- I am going to tell

1073
01:40:40,118 --> 01:40:41,911
Please tell people at home

1074
01:40:43,204 --> 01:40:45,957
We were wondering how to bring it up

1075
01:40:46,041 --> 01:40:49,627
It will get interesting only when
other people like you tell tales

1076
01:40:50,712 --> 01:40:51,588
Go tell them

1077
01:40:51,713 --> 01:40:55,467
Is that how gutsy you are?
I will tell them

1078
01:40:59,596 --> 01:41:02,223
Where's the key?

1079
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:09,481
They look like they're stuck with gum!

1080
01:41:15,361 --> 01:41:19,491
I will get you caught at home
Just you wait!!!!

1081
01:41:20,408 --> 01:41:23,953
You seem a little too "Hot"
Have a soft drink

1082
01:41:30,502 --> 01:41:33,421
You're trying to cool me
down with a soft drink!!

1083
01:41:34,422 --> 01:41:35,965
Not a chance!

1084
01:41:36,591 --> 01:41:38,384
This heat is not coming down

1085
01:41:38,676 --> 01:41:41,638
You guys want to have a good time
and I have to drive the car for you!!!

1086
01:41:46,226 --> 01:41:48,978
Get down from the Car!

1087
01:41:51,439 --> 01:41:54,776
I've been chasing you from
Vallanadu and you've not stopped the car!

1088
01:41:54,859 --> 01:41:56,111
Why are you speeding?
What's this?

1089
01:41:56,277 --> 01:41:57,320
A soft drink

1090
01:41:57,403 --> 01:41:59,531
- Blow
- Why?

1091
01:42:00,782 --> 01:42:03,409
It's just a soft drink, not liquor
Go ahead

1092
01:42:08,498 --> 01:42:11,292
You look classy but
you're drinking local liquor!

1093
01:42:12,127 --> 01:42:14,295
Did you mix this in the soft drink??

1094
01:42:14,420 --> 01:42:17,298
- 6253 Come in!
- Yes Sir!

1095
01:42:17,382 --> 01:42:19,634
- Has he been over speeding?
- Yes Sir!

1096
01:42:19,717 --> 01:42:22,345
- And drunken driving too?
- Drunken driving

1097
01:42:22,971 --> 01:42:25,431
File both cases against
him and throw him in jail

1098
01:42:25,890 --> 01:42:28,184
Our Policemen are not
like the ones in the US

1099
01:42:28,268 --> 01:42:32,021
You can bribe him
and get away with this

1100
01:42:38,987 --> 01:42:41,531
Corruption too
He's bribing me

1101
01:42:41,614 --> 01:42:43,074
- Do you have evidence?
- The evidence is with me

1102
01:42:43,158 --> 01:42:44,159
File that case too

1103
01:42:44,784 --> 01:42:47,328
- Hello! Sir, what are you thinking?
- What?

1104
01:42:47,412 --> 01:42:49,038
- Do you know who he is?
- Who is he?

1105
01:42:49,122 --> 01:42:51,833
He has come from the US
He's a green card holder

1106
01:42:51,916 --> 01:42:53,877
He's got a passport, you can check it

1107
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:59,048
Your passport is in my hands now

1108
01:42:59,299 --> 01:43:01,050
You can't go anywhere
without my knowledge

1109
01:43:01,384 --> 01:43:03,469
You should come for an enquiry
whenever I call you

1110
01:43:05,096 --> 01:43:08,474
He's taking my passport!!
They've even filed a case

1111
01:43:08,808 --> 01:43:10,393
I am not supposed to
go anywhere he says

1112
01:43:10,476 --> 01:43:12,228
- What do I do?
- Don't worry about it

1113
01:43:12,312 --> 01:43:14,606
My brother is a policeman too
I'll take care of it

1114
01:43:14,689 --> 01:43:17,525
Oh yes! I forgot that

1115
01:43:18,484 --> 01:43:20,195
You can file any case you want!!

1116
01:43:20,278 --> 01:43:22,864
Under any section you please
I'll take care of it

1117
01:43:22,947 --> 01:43:25,074
- Isn't that right?
- But there's one condition...

1118
01:43:26,201 --> 01:43:27,452
What condition is that?

1119
01:43:27,535 --> 01:43:29,412
I will talk to my brother
and sort out your problem,

1120
01:43:29,495 --> 01:43:31,539
if you don't tell her sister about us

1121
01:43:32,081 --> 01:43:34,751
If you can clear this for me,
what else am I going to say?

1122
01:43:34,834 --> 01:43:38,087
- Should I leave to America right away?
- You need to stay till the wedding

1123
01:43:38,713 --> 01:43:41,507
There's going to be no wedding now?

1124
01:43:41,966 --> 01:43:43,843
We need to get married, don't we?

1125
01:43:44,052 --> 01:43:46,012
What should I do till then?

1126
01:43:46,095 --> 01:43:53,102
We need to use you as a cover
for all the "Outing" and "Dating"

1127
01:44:18,711 --> 01:44:22,006
Did you see the video?
Both of us got fooled

1128
01:44:22,423 --> 01:44:24,092
The brother has put on an act
for the sake of his brother

1129
01:44:24,175 --> 01:44:25,260
What are we going to do?

1130
01:44:25,927 --> 01:44:27,679
We have a million problems between us

1131
01:44:27,929 --> 01:44:30,390
- We can settle that whenever we want...
- You cannot settle that!!!!

1132
01:44:30,473 --> 01:44:32,141
That is not the problem now!!

1133
01:44:43,653 --> 01:44:47,365
The younger one is playing
around because his brother is a cop

1134
01:44:49,450 --> 01:44:52,036
We were the ones who got the wrong guy

1135
01:44:55,373 --> 01:44:57,583
Only when there's a Wall,
can you make a drawing on it...

1136
01:45:09,512 --> 01:45:15,184
<i>Everything is within our reach
as long as we make the right plans</i>

1137
01:45:15,268 --> 01:45:16,394
Leave me, my sister might see us

1138
01:45:22,358 --> 01:45:23,985
"Light weight"

1139
01:45:24,068 --> 01:45:27,613
- Ya, you mentioned that
even on the first day - Go on!

1140
01:45:33,745 --> 01:45:34,746
What kind of a man are you?

1141
01:45:34,871 --> 01:45:37,665
Your fiancee is walking all the way,

1142
01:45:37,749 --> 01:45:41,919
shouldn't you be carrying her up?

1143
01:45:51,429 --> 01:45:53,639
Sorry Sir, we've run out of diesel

1144
01:45:54,307 --> 01:45:55,933
Won't you check this earlier?

1145
01:45:56,559 --> 01:45:59,228
The petrol bunk is close by
I'll be back

1146
01:45:59,270 --> 01:46:00,772
Go ahead

1147
01:46:08,112 --> 01:46:09,030
Hey!! What are you doing?

1148
01:46:09,113 --> 01:46:11,366
You'll be finished if my sister sees you
You're going to get caught

1149
01:46:12,033 --> 01:46:13,242
I am only going to put this on

1150
01:46:13,451 --> 01:46:17,663
New music is composed by
swaying of a pearl chain...

1151
01:46:17,747 --> 01:46:22,377
Her batting eyes is the
rhythm of beat...

1152
01:46:27,465 --> 01:46:31,386
New music is composed by
swaying of a pearl chain...

1153
01:46:31,469 --> 01:46:34,722
This is how you should impress her

1154
01:46:38,393 --> 01:46:40,353
- Where is she?
- Don't turn back

1155
01:46:41,562 --> 01:46:44,565
The groom likes her a lot
The wedding is fixed

1156
01:47:14,220 --> 01:47:19,600
There's the Policeman,
the fake Policeman!

1157
01:47:25,898 --> 01:47:29,735
- Hey! Don't! Listen to me
- Look at him feeling shy

1158
01:47:30,069 --> 01:47:32,029
He is a "Comedy" Policeman!

1159
01:47:39,036 --> 01:47:40,329
Bash him

1160
01:47:59,015 --> 01:48:00,057
Sister!

1161
01:48:00,725 --> 01:48:04,353
- Let's go on the bike
- Can't do that

1162
01:48:07,482 --> 01:48:08,566
Go!

1163
01:49:04,330 --> 01:49:06,999
Sir... I didn't want to, he was
the one who wanted to keep it

1164
01:49:07,083 --> 01:49:09,710
It had fallen down...
Hey, give it back

1165
01:49:10,211 --> 01:49:14,423
- Take it Sir
- Let's run!!

1166
01:49:44,078 --> 01:49:45,913
Throw him on to the Railway tracks!

1167
01:50:15,901 --> 01:50:19,030
Nothing's wrong with you
You'll be fine

1168
01:50:19,113 --> 01:50:22,033
You'll be fine!
You are fine, I am there by your side

1169
01:50:22,199 --> 01:50:24,785
There's no danger to
your life, don't worry

1170
01:50:49,477 --> 01:50:52,229
We've done the operation
Nothing to worry

1171
01:51:06,994 --> 01:51:09,955
<i>"Birthday Celebrations”</i>

1172
01:51:34,772 --> 01:51:37,441
Did you see that?

1173
01:51:39,318 --> 01:51:42,530
My guys don't leave anything unfinished

1174
01:51:43,322 --> 01:51:45,241
We settle our accounts then and there

1175
01:51:46,242 --> 01:51:50,830
We give away as much blood as we take

1176
01:51:53,207 --> 01:51:58,421
My boys told me your brother
lost a lot of blood last night?

1177
01:52:00,005 --> 01:52:02,425
Which group of blood do you need?

1178
01:52:03,259 --> 01:52:05,553
We have it all

1179
01:52:07,054 --> 01:52:10,266
Are you playing the game in disguise...
The Substitute I can see...

1180
01:52:11,183 --> 01:52:15,187
I believe your brother can't
walk after all the beating he got

1181
01:52:16,063 --> 01:52:18,566
He's unfit to get back on duty

1182
01:52:19,817 --> 01:52:22,278
He'll have to beg at the
traffic junctions from now...

1183
01:52:23,612 --> 01:52:25,239
Are you going to assist him with it?

1184
01:52:27,616 --> 01:52:29,577
You better keep your distance from me

1185
01:52:31,412 --> 01:52:35,291
You'll be reduced to
ashes if you come near me

1186
01:52:37,126 --> 01:52:40,671
My blood's boiling with rage

1187
01:52:40,755 --> 01:52:45,634
You'll be gone with
just one blow of mine

1188
01:52:48,053 --> 01:52:50,598
I need blood from all of you

1189
01:52:50,765 --> 01:52:54,059
But I don't need the Doctor or
a nurse to help me get that

1190
01:52:54,226 --> 01:52:56,353
Have you seen the Lion
draw blood from its prey?

1191
01:52:56,520 --> 01:53:00,691
He'll just charge at his prey and
not let one drop of blood get wasted

1192
01:53:00,775 --> 01:53:02,318
I will do just that

1193
01:53:05,029 --> 01:53:08,032
You better preserve
the blood you've donated

1194
01:53:08,324 --> 01:53:10,034
You will need it yourselves

1195
01:53:13,829 --> 01:53:18,626
You would have to stay
alive till my brother is back

1196
01:53:32,723 --> 01:53:35,643
- Stop giving him injection from tomorrow
- How is my brother?

1197
01:53:36,018 --> 01:53:40,189
He's improving
But his knees are hurt badly

1198
01:53:41,315 --> 01:53:43,275
It's difficult for him
to start walking again

1199
01:53:43,526 --> 01:53:44,777
Go see him

1200
01:54:02,127 --> 01:54:03,212
Come

1201
01:54:05,214 --> 01:54:09,134
The Doctor told me
my legs are hurt badly

1202
01:54:09,218 --> 01:54:11,554
Difficult to walk again

1203
01:54:13,430 --> 01:54:15,558
Do you know how happy I am to hear that?

1204
01:54:16,141 --> 01:54:18,102
I don't need to wear Boots again

1205
01:54:18,519 --> 01:54:20,229
I can chuck my Uniform

1206
01:54:23,023 --> 01:54:26,360
The guys who hit me called me a "Fake"

1207
01:54:28,612 --> 01:54:30,322
I am a fake policeman

1208
01:54:33,784 --> 01:54:36,579
How long will I live a life of fear?

1209
01:54:36,912 --> 01:54:39,832
I can't wait for you
to rescue me each time

1210
01:54:41,292 --> 01:54:43,002
You convinced me about Dad
and Grand dad being policemen

1211
01:54:43,085 --> 01:54:44,879
and got me caught in this unnecessarily

1212
01:54:45,337 --> 01:54:46,422
Look at me now

1213
01:54:49,008 --> 01:54:50,384
So much blood!!

1214
01:54:53,721 --> 01:54:55,848
It feels like another birth!!

1215
01:54:56,765 --> 01:54:58,726
I can do some thing else for a living

1216
01:54:59,268 --> 01:55:01,437
I don't want this police job

1217
01:55:06,567 --> 01:55:08,152
You speak so well!!!!

1218
01:55:09,737 --> 01:55:11,155
I feel so good hearing this

1219
01:55:13,073 --> 01:55:14,783
Why are you scared so much?

1220
01:55:14,867 --> 01:55:19,288
If you are scared, that fear will chase you
wherever you go till your death

1221
01:55:21,206 --> 01:55:23,542
He said your brother is
going to beg on the roads,

1222
01:55:23,626 --> 01:55:27,755
asked me if I will assist you...
What you are saying is even better

1223
01:55:29,757 --> 01:55:33,385
I will chase any one who
hits you and wring his neck...

1224
01:55:35,471 --> 01:55:37,514
I didn't get you in to this job for fun

1225
01:55:39,183 --> 01:55:42,394
Thought throwing you in to the
waters will force you to learn swimming

1226
01:55:42,478 --> 01:55:44,271
But you haven't learnt it till now

1227
01:55:44,480 --> 01:55:46,649
You're still the same scared,
terrified guy

1228
01:55:48,817 --> 01:55:52,446
I've made up my mind
I've decided to let go of you

1229
01:55:52,529 --> 01:55:54,406
You can swim your way
out of this on your own

1230
01:55:55,449 --> 01:55:57,326
You said this was like a new birth

1231
01:55:57,409 --> 01:56:00,204
Why don't you be fearless and
brave at least in this birth?

1232
01:56:00,287 --> 01:56:02,998
Everyone around you
believes you are a real Policeman

1233
01:56:03,082 --> 01:56:04,917
Why can't you believe
that about yourself?

1234
01:56:07,086 --> 01:56:09,672
If there was meaning to the Police
Uniform our dad and grand dad wore...

1235
01:56:10,798 --> 01:56:13,509
Your next step
should be a different one...

1236
01:56:15,010 --> 01:56:18,514
You should settle scores for
each drop of blood you shed...

1237
01:56:19,932 --> 01:56:22,810
You should break the bones of
those very guys who hit you...

1238
01:56:24,728 --> 01:56:27,231
You must show them you
are not fake, but real!!

1239
01:56:40,869 --> 01:56:41,954
What happened?

1240
01:56:49,753 --> 01:56:52,589
- Oh my God!! What happened
- Nothing to worry

1241
01:56:53,424 --> 01:56:55,551
- Why is he like this?
- Nothing to worry

1242
01:56:56,635 --> 01:56:59,138
There was a small
problem at the festival...

1243
01:56:59,221 --> 01:57:01,932
He got hurt while jumping

1244
01:57:02,016 --> 01:57:05,269
The treatment is over,
he'll be fine with a four day rest

1245
01:57:06,437 --> 01:57:07,813
You are so nonchalant about it,

1246
01:57:07,896 --> 01:57:09,732
you will know the pain
only if you were hurt

1247
01:57:11,191 --> 01:57:12,359
I've been asking you
about this for three days...

1248
01:57:12,443 --> 01:57:14,278
You didn't utter a word to me...

1249
01:57:15,112 --> 01:57:16,780
Don't even stand here
Go away

1250
01:57:16,864 --> 01:57:19,283
- Vasanti...
- Please keep quiet

1251
01:57:19,616 --> 01:57:21,577
Granny, ask him to go!!

1252
01:57:23,912 --> 01:57:25,330
I am asking you to go!!

1253
01:57:29,126 --> 01:57:30,085
Why are you getting so worked up?

1254
01:57:30,169 --> 01:57:32,504
If a lion is hurt,
he will limp around for a few days,

1255
01:57:32,588 --> 01:57:34,339
but will soon resume his gait

1256
01:57:34,423 --> 01:57:37,342
Tell him, you're going to
have a little lion soon,

1257
01:57:37,676 --> 01:57:40,763
He will regain his strength

1258
01:57:56,862 --> 01:57:58,030
Come on, get up

1259
01:57:59,615 --> 01:58:01,075
It's as though you are asking
someone to wake from their sleep...

1260
01:58:01,158 --> 01:58:04,119
- Can't do it
- You keep saying you can't!

1261
01:58:04,203 --> 01:58:06,705
- You can! Come on, get up!
- I am hurt badly,

1262
01:58:06,789 --> 01:58:08,957
you would know what it is only
if you are hurt, I can't get up

1263
01:58:10,042 --> 01:58:12,211
- Hey!! Come on
- Leave me

1264
01:58:13,879 --> 01:58:16,340
Listen to me! Nothing will happen
Get up and walk

1265
01:58:18,133 --> 01:58:20,844
Are you kidding me?
Let's go home

1266
01:58:20,928 --> 01:58:24,348
- I am there, give it a shot!
- I said I won't

1267
01:58:32,272 --> 01:58:34,900
You are training him to walk I can see

1268
01:58:36,568 --> 01:58:38,112
That won't happen

1269
01:58:40,322 --> 01:58:42,574
No one has dared to
stand up against us here,

1270
01:58:42,699 --> 01:58:45,327
you think your brother
could get away with it?

1271
01:58:48,330 --> 01:58:51,458
Those who dared to earlier, had to be
confined to a wheel chair just like him

1272
01:58:52,376 --> 01:58:56,797
Be happy we spared him alive,
pack your bags and get out of here, go!!

1273
01:59:00,092 --> 01:59:01,468
Let's go!!

1274
01:59:01,552 --> 01:59:04,555
He's got a lot of men with him
Listen to me

1275
01:59:04,638 --> 01:59:07,224
- What are you doing?
- Stay here

1276
01:59:08,350 --> 01:59:09,893
Where are you going without me?

1277
01:59:09,977 --> 01:59:14,231
Listen to me, don't!! Stop!
Don't hit him!!

1278
01:59:18,861 --> 01:59:20,946
I am telling you not to!!!
Let him go!!

1279
01:59:27,286 --> 01:59:28,245
Don't!!

1280
02:00:19,463 --> 02:00:20,881
Come on! Let's go!!!

1281
02:00:36,939 --> 02:00:41,026
Get lost you Scoundrels!

1282
02:00:43,820 --> 02:00:46,448
What happened to you? Get up!!

1283
02:00:47,324 --> 02:00:48,909
What happened to you?

1284
02:00:49,660 --> 02:00:52,329
Scoundrels ****!!

1285
02:00:53,497 --> 02:00:55,457
Hey!! That's Blood!!

1286
02:00:57,751 --> 02:01:02,047
I am fine...
You're standing...

1287
02:01:03,799 --> 02:01:05,676
You even jumped over the Fencing...

1288
02:01:07,386 --> 02:01:09,471
You even swore at them...

1289
02:01:11,098 --> 02:01:12,266
Am happy...

1290
02:01:15,102 --> 02:01:17,354
Is that why you got hit by them?

1291
02:01:18,105 --> 02:01:20,607
Shouldn't be scared to
hit someone or get hit

1292
02:01:22,150 --> 02:01:24,486
My brother's back on his feet!!!!!

1293
02:03:11,176 --> 02:03:15,055
Writer, pull out all the cases
that have been filed on Mari...

1294
02:03:15,138 --> 02:03:20,477
Kidnap, attempt to murder... everything...
I want each one of them pulled out!!!

1295
02:03:31,405 --> 02:03:32,614
Please come with me

1296
02:03:36,034 --> 02:03:37,494
Start the vehicle

1297
02:03:43,208 --> 02:03:44,709
Do we have enough diesel?

1298
02:03:45,836 --> 02:03:47,629
You're not going to
run away mid way, are you?

1299
02:03:51,216 --> 02:03:53,844
- You didn't expect me to come back...
- I did

1300
02:03:55,595 --> 02:03:57,389
Then, what gave you the confidence
to leave me in the middle of that?

1301
02:03:57,472 --> 02:03:59,307
The confidence I had in you!

1302
02:04:00,058 --> 02:04:02,352
Why should I be
scared to leave you alone?

1303
02:04:03,478 --> 02:04:06,898
You've been handling
everything single handedly from day one

1304
02:04:06,982 --> 02:04:09,860
They threatened me,
they asked me to run away from there

1305
02:04:09,943 --> 02:04:11,820
I was very happy

1306
02:04:11,903 --> 02:04:16,533
I knew you were going to
hunt them down all at once!

1307
02:04:16,616 --> 02:04:18,201
There will be occasional slip ups

1308
02:04:18,618 --> 02:04:20,412
I didn't think this will happen to you

1309
02:04:20,495 --> 02:04:22,747
But I did expect you to come back

1310
02:04:24,166 --> 02:04:27,627
I know you are going to
retaliate in full swing!

1311
02:04:27,836 --> 02:04:31,756
- Can we leave to Mari's house?
- Start the vehicle

1312
02:04:49,024 --> 02:04:51,693
Hey Policeman!!
Isn't it enough the hits you got from us?

1313
02:04:51,776 --> 02:04:53,361
Have you come to get hit again?

1314
02:05:01,703 --> 02:05:02,787
Serve me that leg piece of meat

1315
02:05:10,128 --> 02:05:12,005
Do you know who you are
raising your hands on?

1316
02:05:12,714 --> 02:05:14,341
Do you know who is
raising his hands on you?

1317
02:05:14,424 --> 02:05:15,592
A Policeman!!

1318
02:05:17,260 --> 02:05:20,013
I'll rip your clothes apart,
if any of you come close...

1319
02:05:20,222 --> 02:05:21,306
Come on!!

1320
02:05:23,391 --> 02:05:24,518
Come on!!

1321
02:05:25,727 --> 02:05:26,853
Come on!!

1322
02:05:28,522 --> 02:05:30,524
Hey!! Bring all the Shutters down!!

1323
02:05:31,691 --> 02:05:33,944
Shut it

1324
02:05:34,027 --> 02:05:35,111
Shut it

1325
02:05:43,119 --> 02:05:44,746
Do you want to scare
Me with Shutters?

1326
02:05:48,833 --> 02:05:50,168
Speak UP. open your mouth!!

1327
02:05:52,254 --> 02:05:54,172
What is it? Say it!!

1328
02:06:01,555 --> 02:06:04,808
Come on, Get in
Handcuff him

1329
02:06:04,891 --> 02:06:06,142
Start the vehicle!!

1330
02:06:16,945 --> 02:06:19,739
Stop the vehicle
Go check it out

1331
02:06:20,448 --> 02:06:25,328
I told you there will be chaos
if you raised your hands on me

1332
02:06:25,412 --> 02:06:27,080
Give me that sickle

1333
02:06:27,372 --> 02:06:30,750
Hey!! My brother is a
Policeman and I am a Rogue!

1334
02:06:30,959 --> 02:06:33,587
We dictate the rules henceforth

1335
02:06:33,670 --> 02:06:36,590
If any of you acts smart,
I'll deal with you

1336
02:06:36,715 --> 02:06:38,758
Hey, get lost

1337
02:06:40,260 --> 02:06:44,014
Sir, it's your brother
who is causing a ruckus

1338
02:06:45,223 --> 02:06:48,476
Bring him here!
There's no difference in the eyes of law

1339
02:06:48,935 --> 02:06:52,772
- Go!
- This is what I expected to hear

1340
02:06:54,482 --> 02:06:55,609
Please go!

1341
02:06:56,109 --> 02:06:57,485
Why do you stare at me?

1342
02:06:58,903 --> 02:07:00,947
Why are you
misbehaving in Public, come on!

1343
02:07:01,239 --> 02:07:03,033
Do you know what will
happen if my brother knows this?

1344
02:07:03,241 --> 02:07:05,118
He was the one who
asked me to bring you

1345
02:07:05,619 --> 02:07:10,206
- Leave me
- Move

1346
02:07:11,374 --> 02:07:13,793
Hey! What's this scarf
around you, like a rogue?

1347
02:07:13,877 --> 02:07:15,128
Put the same handcuff around him!

1348
02:07:15,295 --> 02:07:16,671
You are going to
handcuff your own brother??

1349
02:07:16,755 --> 02:07:18,214
No "Brother" sentiments!
Go

1350
02:07:20,759 --> 02:07:23,261
- Are you showing off your might?
- Handcuff him along with that guy!

1351
02:07:23,303 --> 02:07:24,929
Come home, I'll see you then

1352
02:07:28,016 --> 02:07:31,728
Do you want to put me
together with a local criminal?

1353
02:07:37,442 --> 02:07:38,943
What are you looking at?

1354
02:07:50,997 --> 02:07:53,667
I can't wait for the
traffic signal, I am leaving!

1355
02:07:55,919 --> 02:07:57,545
Leave me!! Hey!

1356
02:07:58,922 --> 02:08:00,965
They're escaping Sir...

1357
02:08:12,602 --> 02:08:16,272
The accused are escaping Sir...

1358
02:08:16,773 --> 02:08:18,274
What's this Sir,

1359
02:08:18,441 --> 02:08:21,695
The accused are running away
and you are just watching...?

1360
02:08:22,612 --> 02:08:23,988
Shoot them

1361
02:08:33,998 --> 02:08:36,626
Hey!! Stop...

1362
02:08:36,710 --> 02:08:38,294
Hey!! Stop...

1363
02:08:44,092 --> 02:08:45,593
Hey!! Stop...

1364
02:09:23,965 --> 02:09:25,633
You didn't expect this, did you?

1365
02:09:31,431 --> 02:09:36,102
Vasanthi, one minute please
Can't find the groom

1366
02:09:37,395 --> 02:09:39,939
He couldn't have gone anywhere
He would be in the room perhaps

1367
02:09:40,148 --> 02:09:41,191
Search for him

1368
02:09:44,944 --> 02:09:46,863
Hey dude, they're reciting the hymns

1369
02:09:46,946 --> 02:09:47,989
The wedding ceremony will start shortly

1370
02:09:48,072 --> 02:09:50,283
You are relaxing here, eating sweets!!

1371
02:09:50,366 --> 02:09:52,452
What is the plan for me to go to the US?

1372
02:09:52,535 --> 02:09:55,663
All arrangements have been made,
don't get tense, Come on!

1373
02:09:55,914 --> 02:09:58,708
What's the plan?

1374
02:09:58,875 --> 02:10:03,421
A police officer will meet you at the Airport
and give you your passport and ticket

1375
02:10:03,463 --> 02:10:04,964
All that's fine, but how
do I go to the Airport?

1376
02:10:05,048 --> 02:10:07,801
- The car's waiting for you, look
- A Car?

1377
02:10:09,552 --> 02:10:10,553
Very good

1378
02:10:10,637 --> 02:10:14,641
But people will hold me back
How do I go to the Car?

1379
02:10:14,724 --> 02:10:15,809
Like this!!

1380
02:10:21,314 --> 02:10:25,527
Be a rainfall of flowers on you!
Let' springs wish you prosperity!

1381
02:10:25,610 --> 02:10:29,239
<i>A procession is going on, here</i>

1382
02:10:29,322 --> 02:10:31,950
Deep love erupts out from heart

1383
02:10:32,033 --> 02:10:37,455
Saffron smiles on sister's forehead

1384
02:10:41,209 --> 02:10:45,463
You are dressed up as if you are
the Groom, get out of the way!!

1385
02:10:46,339 --> 02:10:47,715
I did get some one out!

1386
02:10:52,846 --> 02:10:54,013
He isn't there

1387
02:11:02,522 --> 02:11:04,357
This is not sweet enough!!

1388
02:11:04,440 --> 02:11:09,612
- You are happily eating sweets!!
- Why? Can't I eat sweets at a wedding?

1389
02:11:13,867 --> 02:11:15,577
The Groom is missing!!

1390
02:11:15,660 --> 02:11:16,870
Why are you saying
such unceremonious things?

1391
02:11:16,953 --> 02:11:18,580
He will be around
Search for him

1392
02:11:18,663 --> 02:11:23,459
I thought that too...
But, can't find the Groom

1393
02:11:23,751 --> 02:11:25,461
The wedding is in another five minutes

1394
02:11:25,545 --> 02:11:27,881
Ask your department people to find him

1395
02:11:28,339 --> 02:11:29,549
Are you kidding?

1396
02:11:29,632 --> 02:11:32,176
Do you think we're
some kind of Magicians?

1397
02:11:32,260 --> 02:11:35,305
- Where can I go look for him?
- What are you saying?

1398
02:11:35,680 --> 02:11:37,765
We belong to a respectable family,

1399
02:11:37,974 --> 02:11:42,061
It'll be a shame if the
wedding is called off

1400
02:11:42,687 --> 02:11:43,855
What are you saying?

1401
02:11:43,938 --> 02:11:45,315
You were the one who
finalized the Groom

1402
02:11:45,398 --> 02:11:47,859
He stays in America,
he's a green card holder,

1403
02:11:47,942 --> 02:11:50,653
belongs to a respectable family
You know him since he was a child...

1404
02:11:50,904 --> 02:11:54,198
I had my doubts even then
He didn't look right

1405
02:11:54,449 --> 02:11:55,783
His parents weren't
coming for the wedding

1406
02:11:55,867 --> 02:11:57,201
Shouldn't you have
doubted him with that?

1407
02:11:57,577 --> 02:11:59,454
- You sent them on "Outings" and Dates!!!
- Ssshhh!!

1408
02:11:59,537 --> 02:12:00,914
Why are you hushing me?

1409
02:12:02,290 --> 02:12:04,584
This is not the time
to discuss all that

1410
02:12:04,959 --> 02:12:05,919
Do something, please

1411
02:12:06,002 --> 02:12:08,755
Hey!! Stop!!

1412
02:12:08,838 --> 02:12:10,798
No one dare speak ill of the family!!!

1413
02:12:11,257 --> 02:12:12,800
It's a very respectable family

1414
02:12:13,217 --> 02:12:14,594
The Groom did not run away

1415
02:12:14,677 --> 02:12:16,804
Sir, Please wait
Mam, don't go away

1416
02:12:18,348 --> 02:12:20,808
No one dare speak ill of the family!
Groom did not run away

1417
02:12:21,100 --> 02:12:24,896
Hang in there!! I am there
No one should leave

1418
02:12:25,229 --> 02:12:28,524
- I just thought of something...
- Don't talk ill about the bride

1419
02:12:30,485 --> 02:12:32,236
Can't worry about right or
wrong now in this situation,

1420
02:12:32,987 --> 02:12:36,783
Can you please tell your brother...

1421
02:12:36,866 --> 02:12:39,118
Where will he go to
in search of the guy...?

1422
02:12:39,619 --> 02:12:40,995
I am not asking him to
go look for the guy...

1423
02:12:41,371 --> 02:12:45,833
Can you please tell him to...
be the Groom...

1424
02:12:45,917 --> 02:12:47,543
What? To be the Groom?

1425
02:12:47,585 --> 02:12:51,631
What are you saying?
He's a jobless guy

1426
02:12:51,714 --> 02:12:54,342
You're always scolding him

1427
02:12:54,425 --> 02:12:55,802
You don't get along with each other

1428
02:12:55,885 --> 02:12:58,846
Not just that,
very difficult to get him to agree

1429
02:12:58,930 --> 02:13:01,557
No one knows what he has
planned for the future

1430
02:13:02,350 --> 02:13:06,854
Just think about it
You are brothers

1431
02:13:07,105 --> 02:13:09,273
We are sisters

1432
02:13:09,857 --> 02:13:11,275
It's the right combination!!

1433
02:13:11,693 --> 02:13:14,153
You should have thought of this earlier
No point in bringing this up now

1434
02:13:14,988 --> 02:13:18,282
- You can put in a word
- I can't speak to him

1435
02:13:23,788 --> 02:13:28,167
You don't have to speak
Just support me in this

1436
02:13:29,877 --> 02:13:30,878
Fine, come on

1437
02:13:31,838 --> 02:13:35,133
This wedding will happen
as long as I am around

1438
02:13:35,216 --> 02:13:38,261
Hey Priest, don't stop the chants

1439
02:13:38,344 --> 02:13:41,889
- Hey!!
- Yes...

1440
02:13:42,849 --> 02:13:45,018
The rascal!! He ran away like this

1441
02:13:45,184 --> 02:13:48,187
But you don't worry
My bro will find him

1442
02:13:48,646 --> 02:13:51,107
But we have just two minutes more

1443
02:13:52,608 --> 02:13:55,778
Let him go!! You are the one...

1444
02:13:56,738 --> 02:14:00,783
I don't understand what you are saying...

1445
02:14:02,994 --> 02:14:04,912
Bro, do you understand anything?

1446
02:14:05,955 --> 02:14:07,331
Tell him clearly

1447
02:14:07,999 --> 02:14:14,464
- You're the one...
- What are you saying...

1448
02:14:16,049 --> 02:14:19,010
Don't just keep saying something,
fall at his feet

1449
02:14:21,179 --> 02:14:24,223
You are the one who has to
marry my sister!! Please don't refuse

1450
02:14:28,561 --> 02:14:32,523
Why are you falling at my feet
for something as small as this!!

1451
02:14:32,607 --> 02:14:36,652
That's enough
I am feeling shy

1452
02:14:37,695 --> 02:14:38,821
What are you all thinking?

1453
02:14:38,905 --> 02:14:41,032
You wanted me to
marry a groom from the US

1454
02:14:41,115 --> 02:14:43,659
and now you want me to
marry a useless guy!!

1455
02:14:43,743 --> 02:14:46,579
You just want to dump me with a rogue
because I don't have parents to fend for me

1456
02:14:46,662 --> 02:14:51,626
Who are you calling a rogue?
Look at his innocent face...

1457
02:14:51,709 --> 02:14:53,628
We don't recognize his value

1458
02:14:53,711 --> 02:14:57,632
If he doesn't have a job,
that means he will be with you 24/7

1459
02:14:57,715 --> 02:15:01,803
You should be lucky to
marry someone like this

1460
02:15:24,867 --> 02:15:27,620
The "Top ” is on fire!

1461
02:15:30,832 --> 02:15:33,292
What is the magic you have woven?

1462
02:15:33,709 --> 02:15:36,587
<i>What do I say
my dear darling Rose flower?</i>

1463
02:15:36,671 --> 02:15:39,507
You 're the one who's stolen my sleep

1464
02:15:39,590 --> 02:15:42,844
<i>I am singing and dancing with vanity</i>

1465
02:15:42,927 --> 02:15:45,638
Come, join hands with me...

1466
02:15:45,721 --> 02:15:48,808
Your mischievous moustache

1467
02:15:48,891 --> 02:15:51,602
Cannot kill me, go away...

1468
02:15:54,856 --> 02:15:57,608
The "Top ” is on fire!

1469
02:16:00,862 --> 02:16:03,906
What is the magic you have woven?

1470
02:16:39,942 --> 02:16:42,862
Your slender waist blew
me into pieces yesterday

1471
02:16:42,945 --> 02:16:45,865
why don't you seal me
up together with a kiss?

1472
02:16:45,948 --> 02:16:48,868
I want to live my life with you

1473
02:16:48,951 --> 02:16:51,579
Why don't you take me
away somewhere ?

1474
02:16:51,662 --> 02:16:54,665
<i>I am going to carry
you on a piggy back ride</i>

1475
02:16:54,749 --> 02:16:57,877
Let me fulfill at least a
few desires of mine...

1476
02:16:57,960 --> 02:17:00,504
I will accept them,

1477
02:17:00,588 --> 02:17:03,883
You teach me,
and / will learn if one by one

1478
02:17:06,969 --> 02:17:09,889
The "Top ” is on fire!

1479
02:17:12,934 --> 02:17:15,770
What is the magic you have woven?

1480
02:17:15,853 --> 02:17:18,648
<i>What do I say
my dear darling Rose flower?</i>

1481
02:17:18,731 --> 02:17:21,651
You 're the one who's stolen my sleep

1482
02:17:21,734 --> 02:17:24,904
<i>I am singing and dancing with vanity</i>

1483
02:17:24,987 --> 02:17:27,782
Come, join hands with me...

1484
02:17:27,865 --> 02:17:30,910
Your mischievous moustache

1485
02:17:30,993 --> 02:17:34,121
Cannot kill me, go away...

1486
02:18:00,982 --> 02:18:03,859
<i>I went Red when I saw your
beautiful face yesterday</i>

1487
02:18:03,943 --> 02:18:06,821
My dear, why don't you
give me the ”Green signal”

1488
02:18:06,904 --> 02:18:09,865
<i>Don 'I' talk in riddles
Don '1' give me stories</i>

1489
02:18:09,949 --> 02:18:12,868
Just look me in the eye
and tell me what' you want'

1490
02:18:12,952 --> 02:18:15,746
<i>I like the long floral skirt' you wear</i>

1491
02:18:15,830 --> 02:18:18,874
<i>I 'd like to screen a film on if</i>

1492
02:18:18,958 --> 02:18:24,797
I will agree...
I will agree to have your child

1493
02:18:28,009 --> 02:18:30,928
The "Top" is spinning now

1494
02:18:34,056 --> 02:18:36,475
Have learnt the magic

1495
02:18:36,851 --> 02:18:39,729
<i>What do I say
my dear darling Rose flower?</i>

1496
02:18:39,812 --> 02:18:42,732
You 're the one who's stolen my sleep

1497
02:18:42,815 --> 02:18:46,068
<i>I am singing and dancing with vanity</i>

1498
02:18:46,152 --> 02:18:48,779
Come, join hands with me...

1499
02:18:48,863 --> 02:18:51,991
Your mischievous moustache

1500
02:18:52,074 --> 02:18:55,202
Cannot kill me, go away...

1501
02:19:17,767 --> 02:19:21,729
Hey Surulai, no one's here,
where could they have gone?

1502
02:19:54,136 --> 02:19:57,264
Hey!! What audacity to come to...

1503
02:19:57,348 --> 02:20:01,769
...my area and sit in my courtyard!!

1504
02:20:01,894 --> 02:20:03,771
I didn't jump in
stealthily through the roof!

1505
02:20:04,230 --> 02:20:08,818
I've come past everything to
return whatever you gave me

1506
02:20:09,193 --> 02:20:13,364
I've come here to settle
your account in total

1507
02:20:13,531 --> 02:20:16,992
- Hey! Policeman!!
- Inspector of Police, Thirumoorthy!!

1508
02:20:17,159 --> 02:20:18,035
You can be whoever you want to be

1509
02:20:18,119 --> 02:20:19,703
Do you know where you are?

1510
02:20:19,787 --> 02:20:21,330
Do you know where you are?

1511
02:20:21,414 --> 02:20:22,832
Do you know who Big Bro is?

1512
02:20:22,998 --> 02:20:26,752
If you lay your hands on him,
riots will break out!!!

1513
02:20:26,836 --> 02:20:30,673
The place will be on fire!!!

1514
02:20:31,841 --> 02:20:34,093
We're not going to arrest Big Bro,

1515
02:20:35,886 --> 02:20:39,682
- We're going to arrest you
Come on! - Bro!!!!!

1516
02:20:40,057 --> 02:20:41,392
Come on!!

1517
02:20:44,061 --> 02:20:45,396
Come man

1518
02:20:47,731 --> 02:20:48,524
Get in

1519
02:20:54,613 --> 02:20:57,366
I was scared
I thought he'll get you

1520
02:20:57,450 --> 02:21:00,286
- Thank god he took Surulai
- Hey!!

1521
02:21:01,078 --> 02:21:03,622
He's taken him with a plan
He is the important guy,

1522
02:21:03,747 --> 02:21:07,418
If he opens his mouth,
we're dead, we're finished!!

1523
02:21:07,710 --> 02:21:10,171
He knows Surulai is my proxy,
that's why he has taken him

1524
02:21:10,421 --> 02:21:14,758
See where he is taking him,
Follow him, go!!

1525
02:21:19,722 --> 02:21:23,309
Hey!! If you lay your hands on me,

1526
02:21:23,392 --> 02:21:26,437
do you know what Big Bro will do?

1527
02:21:27,438 --> 02:21:28,731
Looks like it will rain

1528
02:21:29,023 --> 02:21:32,568
It looks very sunny,
what do you mean by that

1529
02:21:33,402 --> 02:21:37,364
How is it that our
electricity bill has gone up so much?

1530
02:21:37,448 --> 02:21:40,868
It will of course, Granny is
glued to all the Television serials

1531
02:21:40,951 --> 02:21:42,077
That's true

1532
02:21:46,207 --> 02:21:48,334
What happened?
Where are they?

1533
02:21:48,834 --> 02:21:51,295
They're going all around town,
haven't stopped anywhere

1534
02:21:51,378 --> 02:21:54,465
Follow him wherever they go

1535
02:21:58,552 --> 02:22:01,680
They're not taking him to the Police
station, they're taking him elsewhere

1536
02:22:01,764 --> 02:22:04,683
See where they are going, follow them

1537
02:22:07,686 --> 02:22:10,481
- Should we have Tea?
- Yes, ask them to park somewhere

1538
02:22:16,153 --> 02:22:17,571
Get down

1539
02:22:17,655 --> 02:22:19,490
- No! it's fine, come on
- 3 cups of Tea please

1540
02:22:28,457 --> 02:22:31,544
We're not giving you poison,
this is just Tea

1541
02:22:33,963 --> 02:22:37,800
You've drunk the blood of many,
why are you scared to drink Tea?

1542
02:22:38,217 --> 02:22:40,970
Bro, they're at the Tea Stall

1543
02:22:42,763 --> 02:22:44,807
He's having Tea with them

1544
02:22:54,733 --> 02:22:56,944
They're tapping him on
his shoulders and leaving

1545
02:23:01,323 --> 02:23:03,242
I didn't understand this plan at all

1546
02:23:03,325 --> 02:23:05,786
You asked me not to arrest
Big Bro but Surulai instead

1547
02:23:05,869 --> 02:23:06,996
We didn't say anything to him,

1548
02:23:07,079 --> 02:23:09,248
We just got him Tea, dropped
him off and are leaving now...

1549
02:23:09,331 --> 02:23:10,416
What's the plan?

1550
02:23:11,875 --> 02:23:16,088
Only we know that we
didn't speak to him

1551
02:23:16,297 --> 02:23:19,550
He's been with us for so long,
has had Tea with us

1552
02:23:20,718 --> 02:23:24,221
Even if he claims he didn't say
anything, they won't believe him

1553
02:23:29,101 --> 02:23:30,561
Tell us, Big Bro!!

1554
02:23:33,230 --> 02:23:35,566
Bro!! He's here

1555
02:23:36,859 --> 02:23:39,194
Tell us, Big Bro!!

1556
02:23:40,070 --> 02:23:41,864
Hey!! I didn't say anything!

1557
02:23:42,197 --> 02:23:44,074
He's been with Big Bro
for twenty five years

1558
02:23:44,158 --> 02:23:46,869
He wouldn't have uttered a
word even if we beat him

1559
02:23:46,952 --> 02:23:49,496
But now, he will open up on his own

1560
02:23:49,580 --> 02:23:53,000
- Big Bro!! Should I kill him?
- I didn't say anything!

1561
02:23:53,292 --> 02:23:55,586
- Kill him!
- Come on!!

1562
02:23:56,837 --> 02:23:57,796
No

1563
02:24:09,558 --> 02:24:10,893
Please stop Sir!!

1564
02:24:12,686 --> 02:24:13,729
Slow down!

1565
02:24:24,657 --> 02:24:28,494
I've been with him for twenty five years
I know everything about him

1566
02:24:29,161 --> 02:24:33,040
Now he has asked for me to be killed!!!

1567
02:24:34,124 --> 02:24:35,626
I will tell you anything
you want to know about him...

1568
02:24:35,709 --> 02:24:37,044
Wherever you want me to...

1569
02:24:40,589 --> 02:24:43,258
Surulai told them everything against us

1570
02:24:46,053 --> 02:24:49,515
That inspector is arresting
our boys wherever he sees them

1571
02:24:51,934 --> 02:24:54,436
We can't continue our
business as long as the Policeman

1572
02:24:54,520 --> 02:24:56,522
and his brother are here

1573
02:25:02,736 --> 02:25:03,946
Fling it at me!

1574
02:25:07,199 --> 02:25:08,534
Fling it!!

1575
02:25:09,868 --> 02:25:13,080
- Big bro!
- Fling it!!!

1576
02:25:15,541 --> 02:25:16,667
Fling it!!!

1577
02:25:35,602 --> 02:25:39,398
If I ask you to fling it
you must, not fool around!!

1578
02:25:48,365 --> 02:25:50,284
It's been a while
since I brandished knives

1579
02:25:50,367 --> 02:25:54,997
Just want to check if my body
and mind are in unison, they are

1580
02:25:56,707 --> 02:25:59,001
The game won't stop
if Surulai is not here

1581
02:25:59,293 --> 02:26:00,711
I am getting in to this myself

1582
02:26:02,504 --> 02:26:06,717
Either I survive or the Inspector does

1583
02:26:08,427 --> 02:26:09,428
Come on

1584
02:26:19,897 --> 02:26:23,275
- My stomach's kind of hurting
- What?

1585
02:26:24,651 --> 02:26:27,029
- Can you come back?
- I am coming back now

1586
02:26:37,498 --> 02:26:40,959
What happened?

1587
02:27:11,365 --> 02:27:15,536
Look here Sir...
What happened Sir...

1588
02:27:16,662 --> 02:27:19,248
Big Bro's men came in search of you

1589
02:27:19,832 --> 02:27:22,084
They did this because
they couldn't find you

1590
02:27:22,209 --> 02:27:23,794
Forget about me...

1591
02:27:24,336 --> 02:27:26,922
They are terrible people,
don't spare them

1592
02:27:34,471 --> 02:27:36,431
Big Bro's men have
entered the Police Station

1593
02:27:36,515 --> 02:27:38,684
Let's not keep Surulai there
Change the place

1594
02:27:38,767 --> 02:27:39,893
My wife had called

1595
02:27:39,977 --> 02:27:42,688
She's in pain
I'll take her to the hospital

1596
02:28:43,248 --> 02:28:44,207
Hello!! Listen to what I am saying

1597
02:28:44,291 --> 02:28:47,210
Close all the doors
Don't open the door for anyone

1598
02:28:47,294 --> 02:28:49,880
Open the door only when I come
Do you get that?

1599
02:28:50,672 --> 02:28:52,507
I am on my way

1600
02:30:17,092 --> 02:30:20,387
Vasanthi... Where are you?

1601
02:30:28,520 --> 02:30:29,396
Take this!

1602
02:30:33,191 --> 02:30:34,860
Sister!!! Open the door!!

1603
02:30:35,986 --> 02:30:37,279
Sister!!

1604
02:30:49,166 --> 02:30:50,667
Sister...

1605
02:31:41,384 --> 02:31:42,677
Leave her!

1606
02:31:47,057 --> 02:31:50,185
Hey!! She's the newly wed wife!!

1607
02:32:00,403 --> 02:32:01,947
Don't do anything to her

1608
02:32:02,864 --> 02:32:05,117
You are showing your might
when the Men are not there

1609
02:32:05,867 --> 02:32:07,369
Are you a Man?

1610
02:32:09,996 --> 02:32:11,623
Cowards!!

1611
02:32:21,341 --> 02:32:24,719
I don't like women talking too much

1612
02:32:26,012 --> 02:32:29,808
You said your husband will shoot
us down like we were little birds...

1613
02:32:30,267 --> 02:32:33,979
You said that, didn't you?

1614
02:32:35,605 --> 02:32:37,732
Ask him to come here

1615
02:32:39,276 --> 02:32:42,112
Ask him to come here now!!

1616
02:33:52,599 --> 02:33:54,476
You hit so many people!!!!

1617
02:33:55,477 --> 02:33:57,187
Come on, hit me

1618
02:34:04,277 --> 02:34:06,488
A Policeman!!!!

1619
02:34:07,572 --> 02:34:09,199
Look at your might!

1620
02:34:10,951 --> 02:34:12,911
You know how much you troubled me

1621
02:34:14,246 --> 02:34:16,498
This is my Fortress!!

1622
02:34:22,087 --> 02:34:23,129
No, don't hit

1623
02:34:30,679 --> 02:34:32,639
All Fortresses will fall some day

1624
02:34:35,558 --> 02:34:38,103
One more blood is left out

1625
02:34:39,479 --> 02:34:41,356
If my brother comes here,

1626
02:34:43,024 --> 02:34:45,235
he will not spare any of you

1627
02:34:46,861 --> 02:34:49,698
If any of you are scared for your life,

1628
02:34:49,781 --> 02:34:55,787
go away before he gets here
Go away

1629
02:35:02,961 --> 02:35:05,005
Look at your faith!!

1630
02:35:06,798 --> 02:35:08,383
Will he come here?

1631
02:35:09,676 --> 02:35:11,970
If he does, he will only see your ashes!

1632
02:35:23,273 --> 02:35:24,566
Leave him

1633
02:35:30,405 --> 02:35:33,491
- No
- The wind is on your side

1634
02:35:34,284 --> 02:35:35,994
You seem to have a strong lifeline

1635
02:35:47,756 --> 02:35:52,010
It's not a mere wind
It's a cyclone!!

1636
02:35:53,553 --> 02:35:56,723
See the Lion there!!

1637
02:36:32,634 --> 02:36:34,219
- Take her to the Hospital!!
- Let's go

1638
02:36:36,721 --> 02:36:40,058
I am in pain
A lot of it

1639
02:36:41,017 --> 02:36:42,977
But I will bear it

1640
02:36:44,729 --> 02:36:48,066
How dare they enter this house?

1641
02:36:49,109 --> 02:36:53,571
No one should return alive

1642
02:36:54,155 --> 02:36:55,782
Go, both of you!

1643
02:39:14,837 --> 02:39:16,923
Come on!!

1644
02:39:18,007 --> 02:39:19,008
Where are you taking him?

1645
02:39:19,092 --> 02:39:20,552
Kill him
Kill him now

1646
02:39:20,635 --> 02:39:23,304
No!! There should be no
one like him henceforth

1647
02:39:23,388 --> 02:39:26,391
People should be scared when they
see him being dragged across the streets

1648
02:39:27,517 --> 02:39:29,394
Don't even give him that chance

1649
02:39:31,854 --> 02:39:33,773
He's a rogue elephant,
a rabid dog, a mad man!!

1650
02:39:33,856 --> 02:39:35,942
He should die right
here and now!! Kill him!

1651
02:39:36,025 --> 02:39:38,444
No, listen to me
There are many cases against him

1652
02:39:38,528 --> 02:39:39,571
We need to hand him over in Court

1653
02:39:39,654 --> 02:39:41,155
He will be sentenced to death anyway

1654
02:39:41,239 --> 02:39:43,324
Why are you talking
like a regular Policeman?

1655
02:39:43,408 --> 02:39:44,617
He should die now

1656
02:39:44,701 --> 02:39:46,995
He has killed the only Evidence we had

1657
02:39:47,078 --> 02:39:48,371
Now, He's even entered the house

1658
02:39:48,454 --> 02:39:51,541
He should die now! Either you kill him
or I will kill him myself

1659
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:53,960
Listen to me
Don't act mad

1660
02:39:54,043 --> 02:39:55,962
- Don't take law in your hands
- Listen to me

1661
02:39:56,045 --> 02:39:57,422
Don't be in a hurry

1662
02:40:01,259 --> 02:40:04,679
Sir... Don't listen to him

1663
02:40:04,762 --> 02:40:07,307
He's mad! Do what you have to do

1664
02:40:08,057 --> 02:40:10,435
Why are you interfering
when the brothers are talking?

1665
02:40:10,560 --> 02:40:12,103
I'll kill you if you intrude!!

1666
02:40:13,187 --> 02:40:15,857
Why are you confusing me?
What do you want to do now?

1667
02:40:15,982 --> 02:40:19,027
Fine!! Aren't we only arguing
about whether he should die or not?

1668
02:40:19,110 --> 02:40:20,278
Let's not decide

1669
02:40:20,361 --> 02:40:22,572
- Let the Gun decide
- What are you saying?

1670
02:40:23,656 --> 02:40:27,744
We'll twirl the Gun
If it points at him, he's dead

1671
02:40:27,827 --> 02:40:31,289
- Is that fine?
- Fine!

1672
02:40:59,901 --> 02:41:02,612
The wind is on your side,
you're dead now!!

1673
02:41:28,304 --> 02:41:31,099
Super!! You've attacked
the root of the problem

1674
02:41:31,182 --> 02:41:34,769
I am proud to have someone
like you in my jurisdiction

1675
02:41:35,269 --> 02:41:38,356
Your Hunt shouldn't stop with this
It must continue

1676
02:41:38,481 --> 02:41:42,527
I am praising you and
you're quiet as usual

1677
02:41:42,777 --> 02:41:43,861
No Sir...

1678
02:41:45,113 --> 02:41:49,659
I am anxious and scared each
time you praise me or promote me

1679
02:41:50,368 --> 02:41:52,370
To tell you the truth,
I didn't do this by myself

1680
02:41:52,453 --> 02:41:55,665
Faith in God, someone above you say?

1681
02:41:56,082 --> 02:41:57,375
That's not it Sir...

1682
02:41:57,667 --> 02:42:00,086
My brother did all of this with me

1683
02:42:01,045 --> 02:42:03,881
Yes Sir! My conscience will not
let me go if I don't accept this

1684
02:42:03,965 --> 02:42:05,883
Please punish me if you have to

1685
02:42:07,427 --> 02:42:09,470
Sir, please, my brother
didn't do anything! I did it all

1686
02:42:09,554 --> 02:42:13,391
- That is what he is saying!!
- Please punish me if you have to

1687
02:42:14,976 --> 02:42:18,563
Your brother is a Policeman,
are you an undercover Policeman?

1688
02:42:19,939 --> 02:42:22,150
The two of you have worked but
have earned only one person's salary

1689
02:42:22,233 --> 02:42:25,695
Why punish you?
We need to reward you with a medal

1690
02:42:26,821 --> 02:42:28,823
Continue the good work

1691
02:42:30,491 --> 02:42:31,951
But one thing...

1692
02:42:32,034 --> 02:42:35,121
There are four arrear
papers you need to clear

1693
02:42:35,830 --> 02:42:37,123
Is that fine?

1694
02:42:41,919 --> 02:42:45,715
Can you please help
me with those papers...

1695
02:42:45,798 --> 02:42:48,259
That would be forgery
Impersonation! Can't do that

1696
02:42:49,510 --> 02:42:51,137
YOU are talking about that!!

1697
02:42:53,514 --> 02:42:55,600
Look at his arrogance

1698
02:42:56,350 --> 02:42:58,436
He's come on Training and is
shooting with just one hand

1699
02:42:58,895 --> 02:43:01,147
People normally finish
training and join service,

1700
02:43:01,230 --> 02:43:03,399
But he has been in
service even before training

1701
02:43:03,483 --> 02:43:06,944
Why are you supporting
him so much? Who is he?
