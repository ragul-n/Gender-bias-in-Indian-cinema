all my dreams are on

37
00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:43,501
ajourney that never ends

38
00:04:43,803 --> 00:04:45,998
my uncertain heart is mute

39
00:04:47,273 --> 00:04:50,071
tied scared and does not say

40
00:04:50,276 --> 00:04:53,837
what it wants to say

41
00:04:54,447 --> 00:04:57,644
like an untethered cloud
a lost scrap of a soul

42
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,885
swirls in a
whirlpool of wants and needs

43
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:06,852
leaving bits of my
stort scattered around

44
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:15,523
the sky seems to be filled

45
00:05:16,902 --> 00:05:23,740
with clouds that go nowhere
like dreams without substance

46
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:29,346
but still i dream on, i dream on

47
00:05:52,304 --> 00:05:58,834
dreams like hot air balloons

48
00:05:58,944 --> 00:06:05,315
all talk and no
weight float away from me

49
00:06:06,986 --> 00:06:10,149
confusion flecks the eyes

50
00:06:10,423 --> 00:06:19,297
rises like smoke
and clouds our lives

51
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:23,362
but i have hope
there will come a day

52
00:06:23,536 --> 00:06:27,063
we will know who we are
and where we are going

53
00:06:27,606 --> 00:06:36,036
and it will all begin to make sense

54
00:06:36,482 --> 00:06:44,116
till then the sky seems to be filled

55
00:06:45,424 --> 00:06:52,125
with clouds that go nowhere
like dreams without substance

56
00:06:52,198 --> 00:07:00,606

anil kapoor's hairt chest

00:13:53,785 --> 00:13:54,911
real photographers

177
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,544

snaps for my cousin's wedding...

178
00:13:56,622 --> 00:13:57,919

179
00:13:58,624 --> 00:14:00,285
Y'know you have no
respect for talent!

180
00:14:00,392 --> 00:14:03,293
I know why you're not taking
me into the photography club!

181
00:14:03,395 --> 00:14:04,862
Oh yeah?
- Lrsbian!!

182
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:06,256
What!?!

183
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:15,064
Oh my god! Preity's a lesbian??

184
00:14:15,174 --> 00:14:18,701
No way babe! I don't think she
can make it with a girl either...

185
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,141
i'm gonna trt and make out with her!

186
00:14:24,283 --> 00:14:25,750
What a slap...

187
00:14:26,518 --> 00:14:27,610
wow

188
00:14:27,886 --> 00:14:29,649
he's right you know.
- Preity's a lesbian?

189
00:14:30,722 --> 00:14:33,247
No she doesn't let any guy become
part of the photography club

190
00:14:33,825 --> 00:14:35,588
she's allergic to guys

191
00:14:35,894 --> 00:14:38,488
she's a male repellent.
Just like a mosquito repellent!

192
00:14:38,597 --> 00:14:41,964
Smartass!
- Wow... house full today huh?

193
00:14:42,201 --> 00:14:43,930
Hi ma'am... good morning mam...

194
00:14:44,002 --> 00:14:47,301
hi people... wish i'd see this kind
of attendance in class as well!

195
00:14:47,372 --> 00:14:49,897
Ma'am if you take evert class,
i swear i'll show up for each one!

196
00:14:51,543 --> 00:14:53,067
Ok guys down to work

197
00:14:53,212 --> 00:14:56,875
now you all know that founders
day is just 3 months away...

198
00:14:57,082 --> 00:14:58,549
yes ma'am...

199
00:14:58,617 --> 00:15:00,175
how many of you know...

200
00:15:00,452 --> 00:15:04,650
that it coincides with the
25th anniversart of our college?

201
00:15:04,756 --> 00:15:06,621
Really? Oh yeah?
We didn't know that...

202
00:15:06,758 --> 00:15:09,625
so we need to put up a kick ass show

203
00:15:10,996 --> 00:15:16,332
something new, exciting and
totally totally different... ideas!

204
00:15:16,435 --> 00:15:17,868
Ma'am lets do a play!

205
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:21,406
Shake it shakespeare! A play...
coming from dramatics... how original!

206
00:15:21,873 --> 00:15:24,000
Mohit think of something else

207
00:15:24,543 --> 00:15:27,341
look guys 25th anniversart

208
00:15:27,546 --> 00:15:29,537
silverjubilee of this college

209
00:15:29,748 --> 00:15:31,181
so think of something unique...

210
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,343
...to the college
something that defines it

211
00:15:34,653 --> 00:15:35,984
photography... any ideas?

212
00:15:36,955 --> 00:15:38,081
Ma'am

213
00:15:38,156 --> 00:15:40,920
we could showcase the histort of
the college through photographs...

214
00:15:40,993 --> 00:15:42,620
like a special coffee table book?

215
00:15:44,663 --> 00:15:45,755
What's your problem??

216
00:15:45,864 --> 00:15:47,525
It's boring. What're
you going to have in it?

217
00:15:47,633 --> 00:15:48,964
Photographs of past
principals and faculty?

218
00:15:49,034 --> 00:15:50,160
We need to fix on an angle

219
00:15:50,269 --> 00:15:51,361
just a minute

220
00:15:52,304 --> 00:15:54,499
i didn't ask for a vote yet

221
00:15:55,307 --> 00:15:56,968
ideas first arguments later

222
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,508
and vishal, for someone
who has such a strong opinion

223
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:01,910
you must be having an idea as well?

224
00:16:02,014 --> 00:16:03,606
Possibly better than preity's?

225
00:16:06,685 --> 00:16:11,088
Rvert college has its
share of romances and breakups

226
00:16:11,657 --> 00:16:13,625
but some couples... they last forever

227
00:16:14,493 --> 00:16:16,290
i'm sure that there
must've been several romances

228
00:16:16,428 --> 00:16:17,918
that took off right
here at bunkers point...

229
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:20,157
in the canteen,
corridors, librart, auditorium...

230
00:16:20,365 --> 00:16:21,627
...that ended up in marriage

231
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,134
what if we were to find 25 such
couples and do something with them...

232
00:16:24,202 --> 00:16:25,328
you know?!

233
00:16:26,972 --> 00:16:28,462
Hah! Filmy!

234
00:16:30,575 --> 00:16:35,808
Okay... that's kind
of sweet, romantic...

235
00:16:37,182 --> 00:16:38,274
anyone else?

236
00:16:38,383 --> 00:16:40,112
Ma'am vishal's idea is quite sweet

237
00:16:40,385 --> 00:16:41,852
we could do a play on that idea!

238
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,912
Yeah like a
musical... with songs etc!

239
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:46,953
Nats... what else is a musical??

240
00:16:47,993 --> 00:16:49,290
Vishal you're too funny man!

241
00:16:49,394 --> 00:16:51,453
Pipe down you rascal pipe down

242
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,157
okay lets have the votes please

243
00:16:53,498 --> 00:16:54,624
preity's idea?

244
00:16:57,969 --> 00:16:59,129
No one!!

245
00:16:59,204 --> 00:17:00,501
Vishal's idea?

246
00:17:03,975 --> 00:17:10,005
Ok so we're going to use vishal's
idea... along with preity's...

247
00:17:10,248 --> 00:17:13,376
that's really cool ma'am... nice one!

248
00:17:13,685 --> 00:17:18,452
A photographic documentart on the
romantic histort of the college.

249
00:17:18,724 --> 00:17:20,157
Yeah that's nice... awesome!

250
00:17:20,726 --> 00:17:21,784
What're you doing?

251
00:17:22,761 --> 00:17:24,991
All right clear out
now... get started...

252
00:17:25,197 --> 00:17:30,499
we don't have too much time
left... dramatics stay back please...

253
00:17:31,136 --> 00:17:32,694
lets see what we can
do with you guys...

254
00:17:33,071 --> 00:17:35,232
thanks preity, thanks vishal...

255
00:17:44,116 --> 00:17:45,606
what is it?
- There's a problem.

256
00:17:46,051 --> 00:17:48,747
I don't wanna work with a
grump like you. Back out!

257
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:49,946
Rxcuse me?

258
00:17:50,055 --> 00:17:51,522
Tell ms. Raghubir you don't
want to work on this. - What?!

259
00:17:51,823 --> 00:17:54,724
Pretty slow huh? Tell ma'am you
don't want to work on this project.

260
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,791
Why should i tell her? If you
don't want to do it, you tell her.

261
00:17:57,028 --> 00:17:58,461
Hey didn't you hear what she said?

262
00:17:58,663 --> 00:18:00,426
Really sweet and romantic idea?!

263
00:18:00,699 --> 00:18:02,633
You have absolutely no
clue what romance is about,

264
00:18:03,034 --> 00:18:04,126
so here's my advice to
you... don't bother getting involved!

265
00:18:04,202 --> 00:18:07,330
Hello! I've no interest in working
with you either, on your stupid idea!

266
00:18:07,406 --> 00:18:09,237
So that's what i'm saying...
back out!

267
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,975
Umm... never mind!

268
00:18:12,144 --> 00:18:13,611
Don't worrt, i never mind!!

269
00:18:20,185 --> 00:18:21,277
Baby doll...

270
00:18:21,787 --> 00:18:23,516
why are you trting
to kill the ice cream?

271
00:18:23,989 --> 00:18:26,651
Not the ice cream,
that bloody creature in college.

272
00:18:26,892 --> 00:18:29,725
What's his face? Vishal! I hate him!

273
00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:31,521
You hate all guys!

274
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:32,756
But this one's special!

275
00:18:33,665 --> 00:18:36,031
You've been in this
college... what 3 months?

276
00:18:36,268 --> 00:18:39,829
And you've already found
someone special enough to hate? Wow!

277
00:18:40,205 --> 00:18:42,969
Stop trting to be funny! I
don't like people who act funny!

278
00:18:43,508 --> 00:18:44,998
I take it this guy vishal is funny?

279
00:18:45,076 --> 00:18:47,738
No! He thinks he is funny!

280
00:18:47,979 --> 00:18:49,207
And people around him constantly
encourage him for no bloody reason!

281
00:18:49,281 --> 00:18:50,748
How?
- By laughing.

282
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,074
Oh my god vishal, you're so funny!

283
00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:06,295
Oh god... who are these people who
send friend requests to strangers?!

284
00:19:06,364 --> 00:19:07,854
Full despo types

285
00:19:07,966 --> 00:19:09,593
i mean... i don't know them at all!

286
00:19:09,668 --> 00:19:12,193
I want to be friends
with you baby, add me! Ugh!

287
00:19:12,637 --> 00:19:14,127
Sumit... nah!

288
00:19:14,372 --> 00:19:15,999
Vishal... no!

289
00:19:16,074 --> 00:19:19,168
Huzefa... definitely no!

290
00:19:19,411 --> 00:19:21,003
Uday... please!

291
00:19:21,379 --> 00:19:23,677
Jayesh? No way!

292
00:19:24,983 --> 00:19:26,177
Oh my god!
- What is it?

293
00:19:26,485 --> 00:19:28,009
There's a friend request from rahul!

294
00:19:28,086 --> 00:19:30,418
Who's rahul?
- Rahul, the univ rockstar!

295
00:19:30,489 --> 00:19:31,581
Remember the singer
who pulled me on stage...

296
00:19:31,656 --> 00:19:34,124
...at the rock show the
other night! - Really? Lemme see!

297
00:19:36,328 --> 00:19:37,488
Nice!

298
00:19:37,629 --> 00:19:39,324
But pree...

299
00:19:39,431 --> 00:19:40,921
malu, stop being so modest!

300
00:19:40,999 --> 00:19:42,159
Look at evertone around
you... they're all your fans!

301
00:19:42,267 --> 00:19:44,030
He had to groove with you on
stage once... and now he's your fan!

302
00:19:44,336 --> 00:19:46,634
Bull shit!
- Oh c'mon malu!

303
00:19:46,705 --> 00:19:49,196
There are just two kinds of
people in this world- the ones...

304
00:19:49,307 --> 00:19:51,673
who don't know you and
the others who adore you!

305
00:19:51,743 --> 00:19:54,177
Hah hah! Funny! Anyway, ignore!

306
00:19:54,246 --> 00:19:55,338
But why?

307
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:59,107
What do you mean why? - He's
probably the hottest guy around...

308
00:19:59,484 --> 00:20:01,952
what an awesome singer and hell,
his writing's even better!

309
00:20:02,053 --> 00:20:03,111
Yeah i guess that's no
reason why you'd accept...

310
00:20:03,221 --> 00:20:04,779
...his friend request, right?
Don't do it...

311
00:20:04,956 --> 00:20:06,048
go ahead, delete him!

312
00:20:06,124 --> 00:20:09,719
You know, i used to find him
pretty cool earlier, but not anymore

313
00:20:09,794 --> 00:20:12,024
i mean, how desperate and uncool...

314
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:13,995
to approach a girl
like this on facebook!

315
00:20:14,366 --> 00:20:15,458
No way!

316
00:20:15,534 --> 00:20:16,694
Hi girls!
- Hi ma!

317
00:20:16,801 --> 00:20:17,859
Hi arunima aunty...

318
00:20:17,969 --> 00:20:19,061

Yes aunty. How was work?

Ooof... you are too much!

322
00:20:25,544 --> 00:20:27,171
What're you up to?
- Nothing much...

323
00:20:27,245 --> 00:20:28,371

324
00:20:29,247 --> 00:20:32,444
wow what a dish! Malu
is he your boyfriend?

325
00:20:32,551 --> 00:20:35,782
No way aunty! Rvert guy i
know can't be my boyfriend!

326
00:20:35,887 --> 00:20:37,115
Preity, is he your boyfriend?

327
00:20:37,222 --> 00:20:38,450
What's wrong with you mom?!

328
00:20:38,557 --> 00:20:39,615
He's the rock star of
the entire university!

329
00:20:39,724 --> 00:20:42,591
How could he possibly be my boyfriend?
- Why not? My baby prettiest!

330
00:20:42,661 --> 00:20:45,186
Your baby's best friend prettiest!
It's just my name that's preity!

331
00:20:45,297 --> 00:20:47,026
God i just don't
know who you take after!

332
00:20:47,132 --> 00:20:49,623
Definitely not you.
But presenting exhibit a!

333
00:20:49,701 --> 00:20:50,793
She definitely takes after you

334
00:20:50,869 --> 00:20:51,961
you know... she
should've been your daughter.

335
00:20:52,037 --> 00:20:53,766
Then you would've been happy!
- You're right!

336
00:20:54,406 --> 00:20:55,896
But now that i'm stuck
with you... i'll manage...

337
00:20:56,141 --> 00:20:57,369
good night arunima!

338
00:20:57,475 --> 00:20:58,737
Yes, i'm leaving!

339
00:20:58,877 --> 00:21:01,345
I have a con call in half
an hour, so keep it low!

340
00:21:01,846 --> 00:21:02,938
Aye aye captain!

341
00:21:03,048 --> 00:21:04,242
Clean your room!

342
00:21:04,349 --> 00:21:06,840
Okay!
- Oh god, arrgh!

343
00:21:06,952 --> 00:21:08,351
You're so lucky!

344
00:21:09,754 --> 00:21:12,655
Why!
- Your mom is always around you!

345
00:21:13,358 --> 00:21:14,586
And why am i lucky?

346
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,019
Because your mom is not

He's lying!

479
00:27:43,114 --> 00:27:44,877
Whatever issues you
might have with each other

480
00:27:44,983 --> 00:27:46,917

481
00:27:47,819 --> 00:27:49,616
so whatever it is... sort it out!

482
00:27:50,688 --> 00:27:52,212
Send each other hate mails,
fight it out on blogs...

483
00:27:52,323 --> 00:27:53,381
...i don't give a damn

484
00:27:53,491 --> 00:27:54,719

...dying to work on
the founder's day show...

486
00:27:57,662 --> 00:28:00,597
...and you guys... you guys are just
caught up in your petty quarrels

487
00:28:01,265 --> 00:28:03,233
rither the two of you work
together on this project...

00:28:03,301 --> 00:28:04,427

I'll get someone else...

490
00:28:11,376 --> 00:28:13,105
and now... unless you
step out of here...

491
00:28:13,177 --> 00:28:14,667

able to get at each other...

492
00:28:15,713 --> 00:28:17,408
so get out and sort it out now.

493
00:28:25,556 --> 00:28:26,648

00:28:34,699 --> 00:28:36,223
Do i go and sneak to raghubir? No!

Vishal's so mean!

As though she didn't bite him back?

507
00:28:57,288 --> 00:28:58,721
She was totally asking for it

508
00:28:58,823 --> 00:29:00,051

00:37:22,693 --> 00:37:24,422
tacky and desperate right?

624
00:37:25,229 --> 00:37:27,288
That night at the show was fun...

625
00:37:28,532 --> 00:37:31,000
and i had no other way of
getting in touch with you.

626
00:37:31,535 --> 00:37:32,661

00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:35,538

the request didn't you?

00:37:36,707 --> 00:37:38,038

i've been calling you for ages!
Where the hell have you been?

631
00:37:49,186 --> 00:37:52,815
Man don't you know that when a guy's
out on a date with a hot girl

632
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:54,323
it's rude to pick up the phone?

633
00:37:54,391 --> 00:37:56,222
Date? You call that a date?

634
00:37:56,327 --> 00:37:57,385
What else was it?

635
00:37:57,494 --> 00:38:00,054
You just went to meet her,

Of course, for you!
I liked her, for you

me some tender loving care...

643

644
00:38:17,748 --> 00:38:19,545

any rock star type attitude

650
00:38:32,796 --> 00:38:35,731
he's just a plain
and simple great guy.

651
00:38:35,833 --> 00:38:38,063
Actually, just my type!

652

You like him!
- Yeah... why?

653
00:38:42,606 --> 00:38:45,598
Like like or lust like?

654
00:38:45,709 --> 00:38:47,233
First you send me to meet him...

655
00:38:47,311 --> 00:38:49,472
...and then you play
20 questions with me!

656
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:52,674
Pree if you're so worried i like him
why don't you meet him yourself??

657

673
00:40:08,358 --> 00:40:09,723

00:40:09,827 --> 00:40:12,261
Sure? Okay, do come in

675
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,568
so do tell us, when did

676
00:40:21,939 --> 00:40:24,305
Well... we were
classmates... and she was hot!

677
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:29,436
He was the class
topper... and a total nerd!

678
00:40:29,513 --> 00:40:30,673
Never ever spoke to me!

679
00:40:30,781 --> 00:40:31,839
Really?

680
00:40:31,949 --> 00:40:33,541
So how did you fall in
love with each other?

681
00:40:33,884 --> 00:40:36,375
Well... for three whole years,
he just stared at me

682
00:40:36,487 --> 00:40:38,546
whoa... you were always
surrounded by other guys

683
00:40:38,655 --> 00:40:41,590
i didn't even know if
you'd ever noticed me!

684
00:40:41,692 --> 00:40:43,057
You were scared,
that's what you were!

685
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,422
And you were so pretty!

686
00:40:44,528 --> 00:40:47,190
I didn't dare to dream that
you'd ever even look at me!

687
00:40:49,399 --> 00:40:51,799
One day, under the
pretext of having a cup of tea,

688
00:40:51,902 --> 00:40:53,392
i asked him to meet
me at bunkers point...

689
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:56,132
and straight away asked him
why do you keep staring at me?

690
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,332
I was taken aback

691
00:40:57,441 --> 00:40:59,238
i quickly said that it's one of
my friends who's attracted to you

692
00:40:59,309 --> 00:41:00,571
so then i told him right away...

693
00:41:00,644 --> 00:41:04,011
to tell his 'friend' that
i was attracted to him as well!

694
00:41:05,015 --> 00:41:06,676
What if there was a friend for real?

695

working on this project!

702
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:27,362
I'm part of it as well get it?!

703
00:41:27,437 --> 00:41:29,769
This project is about love.
Totally beyond your understanding

704
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,000
as though you know a lot about love

705
00:41:31,108 --> 00:41:32,632
you just know how to love yourself!

706
00:41:32,743 --> 00:41:36,679
At least i love myself.
You don't even do that!

707
00:41:39,016 --> 00:41:41,450
I mean, look at you!
Shabby clothes...

708
00:41:41,785 --> 00:41:44,345
unkempt hair! Disgusting!

709
00:41:44,454 --> 00:41:46,149
I don't need to look pretty,
i'm intelligent!

710
00:41:46,924 --> 00:41:49,256
That is the dumbest
thing i've ever heard!

711
00:41:49,827 --> 00:41:51,522
Pretty idiotic huh?!

712
00:41:54,364 --> 00:41:56,798
Are you waiting for an
invite to start this rickshaw?

713
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,026
Come on let's go!

714
00:41:58,101 --> 00:41:59,762
Madam i think you'll have
to take another rickshaw

715
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:01,337
mine's out of gas
- what on earth is wrong with you?!

716
00:42:01,405 --> 00:42:02,497
I've been sitting
here for an hour now...

717
00:42:02,606 --> 00:42:03,664
couldn't you just tell me earlier?

718
00:42:03,774 --> 00:42:06,265
As if you ever asked me? You
just came and plonked yourself!

719
00:42:06,343 --> 00:42:08,903
Arrgh! City full of fools!

720
00:42:11,448 --> 00:42:12,710
Oh great!

721
00:42:12,816 --> 00:42:16,308
Awww. Baby's rickshaw broke down?

722
00:42:16,386 --> 00:42:19,685
Haww... pretty unlucky huh!

723
00:42:20,424 --> 00:42:22,153
Bye!

724
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:34,764
So?

725
00:42:35,472 --> 00:42:36,632
So?

726
00:42:36,974 --> 00:42:38,635
How was it?

727
00:42:39,276 --> 00:42:40,402
What?

728
00:42:40,677 --> 00:42:43,305
Coffee? How was the coffee date?

729
00:42:44,314 --> 00:42:45,508
Great

730
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:48,682
great... great?

731
00:42:49,486 --> 00:42:54,685
Yeah. Plain and simple great!

732
00:42:55,759 --> 00:42:56,919
And?

733
00:42:57,995 --> 00:42:59,087
What?

734
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:01,056
Me?

735
00:43:02,366 --> 00:43:03,628
Just my type!

736
00:43:04,902 --> 00:43:06,028
Oh!

737
00:43:08,205 --> 00:43:09,638
Shall we meet again?
- Shall we meet again?

738
00:43:12,976 --> 00:43:14,102
When?

739
00:43:14,444 --> 00:43:16,935
Tonight! It's saturday night!

740
00:43:17,447 --> 00:43:21,213
Tonight? Shit! Shit shit shit!

741
00:43:21,318 --> 00:43:22,615
Rrr...

742
00:43:23,186 --> 00:43:25,347
am busy... going
clubbing with a friend!

743
00:43:28,492 --> 00:43:30,585
That's cool. Get her along...

744
00:43:31,495 --> 00:43:34,555
in fact, i'll
bring a friend as well.

745
00:43:34,631 --> 00:43:36,155
Velvet lounge at 10?

746
00:43:37,301 --> 00:43:38,461
Great.

747
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:44,500
Hey how do i look?

748
00:43:44,608 --> 00:43:46,337
Bro, how does it matter?!

749
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:51,473
It does!
Clothes... okay, hair... too much gel?

750
00:43:51,548 --> 00:43:52,879
Too much desperation!

751
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:54,474
Hah! Look who's talking
about being desperate!

752
00:43:54,584 --> 00:43:55,915
Have you ever managed to
score with a girl yet?

753
00:43:55,986 --> 00:43:58,250
No. But just see how cool i am
that i'm still not desperate!

754
00:43:58,355 --> 00:44:00,550
Shut up bitch! Rahul come
on... we're running late!

755
00:44:00,624 --> 00:44:02,717
I'm not going. I'll drop you there

756
00:44:03,026 --> 00:44:04,186
are you insane?!

757
00:44:04,261 --> 00:44:08,254
Why? What's the point? You
want to meet him... you go ahead!

758
00:44:08,365 --> 00:44:10,060
He wants to meet you, not me!

759
00:44:10,167 --> 00:44:11,293
I've met her once already!

760
00:44:11,368 --> 00:44:13,529
Is she that ugly that
you can't meet her again?

761
00:44:13,637 --> 00:44:15,400
She's not ugly... and that's
why i don't want to meet her

762
00:44:15,472 --> 00:44:17,804
what if i end up with her,
instead of you?!

763
00:44:17,908 --> 00:44:19,205
Jerk!

764
00:44:19,309 --> 00:44:21,436
And in any case, if both of us
show up, who's going to talk to him?

765
00:44:21,545 --> 00:44:22,705
You or me?

766
00:44:22,779 --> 00:44:25,646
Me. No you. I mean me.
We'll see when we get there!

767
00:44:25,716 --> 00:44:29,652
Listen preity, you should just
meet him as yourself. Not...

768
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,711
as me. I think he'll fall for you...

769
00:44:31,822 --> 00:44:34,950
in any case, when she finds
out that you are not me...

770
00:44:35,025 --> 00:44:36,151
and that it's actually me who's
me and whatever i say as you...

771
00:44:36,226 --> 00:44:37,318
i actually say as me...

772
00:44:37,394 --> 00:44:38,691
she'll still think that it's you
who is saying it and not me...

773
00:44:38,762 --> 00:44:40,559
what the hell am i saying?!

774
00:44:40,664 --> 00:44:43,064
I think you're high. All that
cologne you doused yourself in...

775
00:44:43,133 --> 00:44:44,566

776
00:44:44,634 --> 00:44:45,726

778
00:44:49,239 --> 00:44:50,604
Asshole! Should i just kill you?!

779
00:44:50,707 --> 00:44:51,799
Let's throw him out of the car!

cause love is on air with rj seema.

854
00:53:03,499 --> 00:53:06,161
The sky is our slate

855
00:53:06,269 --> 00:53:08,863
just grab a passing cloud,
a drop of sunshine or two

856
00:53:08,971 --> 00:53:13,135
and write me a message

857
00:53:14,343 --> 00:53:16,834

858
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:19,614
how to give you the news

859
00:53:19,949 --> 00:53:24,079
that everything i
think seems brand new today

00:53:28,057 --> 00:53:30,457
leaping into the light

862
00:53:30,626 --> 00:53:35,859

863
00:53:35,932 --> 00:53:38,594

867
00:53:52,682 --> 00:53:55,242

868
00:53:55,384 --> 00:53:57,944
in different places

869
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:02,454
in strangers' faces

870
00:54:03,559 --> 00:54:06,153
the books i read

871
00:54:06,362 --> 00:54:08,990
the tales they tell

872
00:54:09,098 --> 00:54:13,933
are now all about you

873
00:54:14,437 --> 00:54:19,704
our conversations are taking flight

874
00:54:19,942 --> 00:54:22,410
leaping into the light

875
00:54:22,512 --> 00:54:25,504
slipping and sliding away

876
00:54:25,581 --> 00:54:28,072
uh oh uh oh what just happened

877
00:54:28,184 --> 00:54:30,675
uh oh uh oh i think it's called love

878
00:54:30,753 --> 00:54:33,517
uh oh uh oh i think it might be true

879
00:54:33,589 --> 00:54:37,821
i guess i've fallen in love

880
00:55:08,658 --> 00:55:09,750
just like that without a warning

881
00:55:09,825 --> 00:55:10,951
my talkative heart wants to

882
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:14,291
make unbreakable
promises if you look this way

883
00:55:14,397 --> 00:55:18,390
we could talk about
how silly i'm being

884
00:55:19,669 --> 00:55:21,159
for the first time

885
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:22,737
without a warning

886
00:55:22,805 --> 00:55:25,296
my roundabout heart
is talking in riddles

887
00:55:25,374 --> 00:55:27,035
if you give me a chance

888
00:55:27,109 --> 00:55:29,737
we could solve them together

889
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,348
i dream about dreaming up

890
00:55:33,583 --> 00:55:36,051
dreamy meetings with you

891
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:41,814
i dream about the this and the
that that i could be talking with you

892
00:55:41,891 --> 00:55:43,552
just waiting and wishing that

893
00:55:43,659 --> 00:55:44,717
our conversations will flight

894
00:55:44,794 --> 00:55:45,920
leaping into the light

895
00:55:46,028 --> 00:55:47,495
slipping and sliding away

896
00:55:47,563 --> 00:55:49,861
uh oh uh oh what just happened

897
00:55:50,066 --> 00:55:52,591
uh oh uh oh i think it's called love

898
00:55:52,668 --> 00:55:55,330
uh oh uh oh i think it might be true

899
00:55:55,538 --> 00:55:58,439
i guess i've fallen in love

900
00:55:58,507 --> 00:56:00,668
uh oh uh oh what just happened

901
00:56:00,876 --> 00:56:03,504
uh oh uh oh i think it's called love

902
00:56:03,613 --> 00:56:06,104

Uh duh! Hey you looked like you

907
00:56:28,838 --> 00:56:30,032
Dream on romeo

908

i don't like nightmares!

909
00:56:32,041 --> 00:56:34,509
But hey, if you wear
clothes like this evert day...

910
00:56:34,677 --> 00:56:36,269
like a cutesy ditsy girly girl...

911
00:56:36,345 --> 00:56:38,575

it... as a favour of course

912
00:56:38,681 --> 00:56:39,773

913
00:56:45,388 --> 00:56:46,719

00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:48,548

915
00:56:48,624 --> 00:56:49,716
Oh yeah? You think its hacky then?

916
00:56:49,792 --> 00:56:51,123
No i'm mean it's just not

917
00:56:51,394 --> 00:56:54,625

918
00:57:06,575 --> 00:57:08,406
rnough! Delete the damn mms!

919
00:57:08,944 --> 00:57:11,811
Don't be silly! I still need
to top up my phone card...

920
00:57:11,914 --> 00:57:13,506
...pay off my canteen bill...

921
00:57:14,183 --> 00:57:17,209
and this, this is my
new credit card...

922
00:57:17,586 --> 00:57:19,144
visa power, go get it!

923
00:57:22,892 --> 00:57:26,851
She was the most irritating girl in
the entire college, she was! - Really?

924
00:57:27,296 --> 00:57:30,356
And god knows what he
thought of himself! So arrogant!

925
00:57:30,566 --> 00:57:33,729
And what about you? As though you
were a quiet meek one! Look at her!

926
00:57:33,803 --> 00:57:34,895
And then?

927
00:57:34,970 --> 00:57:36,904
We just kept fighting
through college for three years

928
00:57:37,306 --> 00:57:39,900
then on the last day
it suddenly hit me that

929
00:57:40,943 --> 00:57:43,537
i would never see her again,
never quarrel with her again...

930
00:57:43,779 --> 00:57:45,679
she's cute eh? - Yes sir...

931
00:57:45,781 --> 00:57:47,373
and then i proposed...
as we fought...

932
00:57:47,483 --> 00:57:50,008
well i said yes finally, didn't i?
- Thanks for the favour sweetheart!

933
00:57:50,086 --> 00:57:53,021
Oh god, you think you're so funny!
- Hello! I am funny!

934
00:57:53,089 --> 00:57:54,488
Give me a break!

935
00:57:54,557 --> 00:57:57,890
Sweetie you've broken enough stuff
in the house already... - stop it!

936
00:58:03,999 --> 00:58:05,261
Boss two ice creams please.

937
00:58:05,367 --> 00:58:07,562
I don't want it -go on

938
00:58:07,636 --> 00:58:10,571
what? - I don't want to
cross the credit limit

939
00:58:13,008 --> 00:58:14,805
you should smile more often,
you'll make more friends

940
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:17,003
i don't think there's any connection
between the two, i mean look at you

941
00:58:17,113 --> 00:58:18,341
hello i have friends

942
00:58:18,447 --> 00:58:19,505

943
00:58:19,615 --> 00:58:20,673

944
00:58:20,816 --> 00:58:22,181
that's two

945
00:58:22,351 --> 00:58:23,841
that's because i'm selective

946
00:58:23,919 --> 00:58:25,648
i could make tons more
if i wanted to -right

947
00:58:25,721 --> 00:58:28,053
you don't believe me? - You know
your brain is like a... a... trash can!

948
00:58:28,157 --> 00:58:29,749
Oh yeah? - What's wrong with you?

949
00:58:29,825 --> 00:58:32,692
I think i've got immense style...
- yeah right! Dream on...

950
00:58:45,374 --> 00:58:47,365
nothing much, just
following you around.

951
00:58:51,614 --> 00:58:53,047
Shopping alone?

952
00:58:53,182 --> 00:58:55,343
Yeah just doing some
research for a new project.

953
00:58:55,451 --> 00:58:56,713
I'm working on a new collection.

954
00:58:56,786 --> 00:58:59,983
I get it! This is where you
steal your fashion ideas from.

955
00:59:00,489 --> 00:59:02,218
Shhh don't tell anyone.

956
00:59:04,493 --> 00:59:06,120
Hey d'you want to grab a bite?
I'm kind of hungrt.

957
00:59:10,499 --> 00:59:11,989
Chelsea? Don't tell me!

958
00:59:12,067 --> 00:59:14,729
They changed their managers
six times in the last ten years

959
00:59:15,004 --> 00:59:18,269
i mean they threw out mourinho!
Chelsea? Really?!

960
00:59:42,665 --> 00:59:44,565
Hello dear, did you sleep well?

961
00:59:47,036 --> 00:59:48,560
Oh my god, what's wrong with you?

962
00:59:49,972 --> 00:59:51,098
Are you insane?!

963
00:59:53,042 --> 00:59:55,272
Look at him! He's staring at us!

964
01:00:01,550 --> 01:00:04,576
So what happened the other night?
You just disappeared.

965
01:00:04,653 --> 01:00:06,814
Preity wanted to go home, so
i left as well to drop her.

966
01:00:06,889 --> 01:00:08,049
Didn't she tell you?

967
01:00:08,123 --> 01:00:09,522
She did... but she also said...

968
01:00:09,592 --> 01:00:11,958
...that you were planning
to come back to the club.

969
01:00:12,061 --> 01:00:13,153
What happened?

970
01:00:14,396 --> 01:00:17,126
You got bored with vishal?
Not possible

971
01:00:17,366 --> 01:00:19,459
he's quite entertaining -great guy

972
01:00:20,336 --> 01:00:21,462

973
01:00:21,704 --> 01:00:22,796
Sweet

974
01:00:29,211 --> 01:00:30,337
i wonder

975
01:00:30,446 --> 01:00:31,606

976
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,272
Nah. Nothing. - Tell me. Come on.

977
01:00:33,349 --> 01:00:37,752
No i was just thinking. What if i
hadn't sent you that friend request.

978
01:00:38,921 --> 01:00:40,047
Would we have met?

979
01:00:40,756 --> 01:00:45,716
Sure we would. I think. We would've
met through friends perhaps

980
01:00:46,528 --> 01:00:49,053
or maybe here,
while watching a match!

981
01:00:49,465 --> 01:00:51,763
You would've been cheering for chelsea
while i was rooting for man u

982
01:00:51,834 --> 01:00:52,926
then we would've argued
about which team's better!

983
01:00:53,035 --> 01:00:54,502
And then i would've
bought you a drink

984
01:00:54,603 --> 01:00:56,093
to make up, you know?

985
01:00:57,306 --> 01:00:59,536
And then i would've
said hi i'm malvika

986
01:00:59,708 --> 01:01:01,972
and i would've said
hi malvika i'm rahul

987
01:01:02,411 --> 01:01:04,811
so rahul... what do you do?

988
01:01:05,147 --> 01:01:08,947
Well i've been rooting for man u
all this while but now i think

989
01:01:09,184 --> 01:01:11,311
i'll start cheering
for chelsea. And you?

990
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:13,720
I'll still be rooting for chelsea!

991
01:01:14,990 --> 01:01:17,618
So who are you? Apart from being
chelsea's new manager that is...

992
01:01:17,726 --> 01:01:18,886

1002
01:02:35,037 --> 01:02:38,404
No i think i should leave.
Should we ask for the bill?

1003
01:02:42,911 --> 01:02:44,845
So... is malvika home?

1004
01:02:44,947 --> 01:02:46,039
I don't know. Why?

1005
01:02:46,115 --> 01:02:47,582
Just. Making polite conversation?

1006
01:02:49,785 --> 01:02:51,753
It's pretty late. Will
they let you in at the hostel?

1007
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:53,344
No sweat. I have my ways

1008
01:02:53,455 --> 01:02:54,888
i don't even want to know!!

1009
01:03:07,770 --> 01:03:12,707
The whole day went by
without us talking. I missed you.

1010
01:03:13,575 --> 01:03:15,873
He missed me? He missed me!

1011
01:03:19,348 --> 01:03:22,875
I thought of you at exactly the
same time that you thought of me

1012
01:03:22,985 --> 01:03:24,612
say about 5 minutes ago?

1013
01:03:36,565 --> 01:03:39,864
Malu! I'm so happy!

1014
01:03:39,968 --> 01:03:41,458
Do you want some
cold coffee? - Yes please

Yes thanks -great

1017
01:04:07,329 --> 01:04:08,956
malvika's asking for a favour.

1018
01:04:09,031 --> 01:04:11,522
Malvika! And you're actually
considering not helping her?

1019
01:04:13,402 --> 01:04:14,494

01:04:15,571 --> 01:04:16,697
Help her friend out dammit!

1022
01:04:16,805 --> 01:04:18,170
No man. I don't want to meet her.

1023

Dude priety isn't that bad ok?

1024

Hold on... i can't believe that i have

You like him don't you?

01:05:05,387 --> 01:05:07,378
Hey... hey you crazy idiot!!

No seriously... i mean, how
can anyone be so good looking?!

1072
01:07:33,468 --> 01:07:34,992
You're almost pretty when you smile

1073
01:07:36,171 --> 01:07:38,036
and you're almost nice
when you say stuff like that

1074
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:39,471
don't be almost rude okay?

1075
01:07:39,541 --> 01:07:40,667
I'm being almost
truthful when i say that!

1076
01:07:40,742 --> 01:07:42,369

- You almost shut up!

1077
01:07:42,444 --> 01:07:43,672

How did it go with rahul?

1101
01:09:07,429 --> 01:09:09,090
You know, spending the
entire day with him... the shoot?

1102
01:09:09,164 --> 01:09:11,132
Oh shoot... yeah it was okay...

1103
01:09:11,867 --> 01:09:12,959

1104
01:09:23,979 --> 01:09:25,139
Vishal?

1105
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:28,110
Late again. Hacky where
the hell is your buddy?

1106
01:09:28,617 --> 01:09:29,914
If he doesn't hand me the
write ups when he's supposed to...

1107
01:09:30,018 --> 01:09:31,178
how am i expected to
make the layouts on time??

1108
01:09:31,286 --> 01:09:32,947
Chill... give him a break

1109
01:09:33,054 --> 01:09:35,045
there're tons of interviews
that he's got to work on...

1110
01:09:35,590 --> 01:09:36,682
and then we went to
kanheri caves yesterday...

1111
01:09:36,792 --> 01:09:37,850
got back only by night time;
maybe that's why he's late

1112
01:09:37,959 --> 01:09:39,051
kanheri caves?

1113
01:09:39,394 --> 01:09:40,486

1118
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:53,466
Let's go!

1119
01:09:57,813 --> 01:09:59,212
Vishal and mogambi?!

1120
01:10:16,431 --> 01:10:18,592
No seriously... you
haven't met my mom yet!

1121
01:10:18,667 --> 01:10:20,635
She's perfect... beautiful,
talented...

1122
01:10:20,735 --> 01:10:21,827
she runs her own publishing house

1123
01:10:21,903 --> 01:10:23,803
that's cool. What's it called?

1124
01:10:23,872 --> 01:10:25,339
Tagore. - What're you saying?!

1125
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:26,873
I'm reading a book right now
that's published by them...

1126
01:10:26,942 --> 01:10:28,534
it's by this young
upcoming bright writer.

1127
01:10:28,643 --> 01:10:29,837
Let me check. One sec.

1128
01:10:30,679 --> 01:10:31,873
Sole to soul.

1129
01:10:32,848 --> 01:10:33,940
Nice huh?

1130
01:10:37,419 --> 01:10:38,909
What's up? You didn't like the book?

1131
01:10:39,921 --> 01:10:41,821
No... i don't like the writer.

1132
01:10:44,092 --> 01:10:45,423
Siddhant shekhar.

1133
01:10:46,528 --> 01:10:47,620
You know the guy?

1134
01:10:47,896 --> 01:10:48,988
Long boring stort

1135
01:10:50,966 --> 01:10:52,092
i like stories.

1136
01:10:56,538 --> 01:10:59,769
Boy meets girl. Girl
falls in love with the boy.

1137
01:10:59,975 --> 01:11:02,341
Boy uses her to get
his book published.

1138
01:11:02,444 --> 01:11:04,537
Girl's heart is broken.
Blah blah blah blah...

1139
01:11:05,013 --> 01:11:06,571
then the girl moves
to another college.

1140
01:11:06,815 --> 01:11:09,375
One more guy shows up and
gets under her skin... big time.

1141
01:11:09,818 --> 01:11:12,116
You're right. Long boring stort...

1142
01:11:13,088 --> 01:11:14,578
smile.
- What're you doing?!

1143
01:11:14,689 --> 01:11:16,054
You're a strange photographer...

1144
01:11:16,358 --> 01:11:18,952
you ought to know i'm
taking your picture! - Stop it!

1145
01:11:19,027 --> 01:11:20,392
Pretty photogenic huh?

1146
01:11:21,530 --> 01:11:23,122
Rubbish!
- So. No boyfriend?

1147
01:11:23,198 --> 01:11:24,358
No, not interested.

1148
01:11:24,599 --> 01:11:26,226
Lesbian?! - No!!!

1149
01:11:27,669 --> 01:11:29,500
There must be someone
that you're interested in...

1150
01:11:42,050 --> 01:11:43,745
what's the point? As
though he's going to like me!!

1151
01:11:43,852 --> 01:11:45,752
Hey hey hey... if you trt
hard... he might like you...

1152
01:11:46,755 --> 01:11:49,087
my own father didn't want me.
The day i was born he left

1153
01:11:50,358 --> 01:11:51,586
you probably think that even
global warming is happening

1154
01:11:51,693 --> 01:11:53,160
'cause of you... right?!

1155
01:11:53,228 --> 01:11:55,162
Now that you mention
it... it's quite possible

1156
01:11:55,263 --> 01:11:56,389
you're such an idiot!

1157
01:11:56,464 --> 01:11:57,829
Where're your
brains for god's sake?!!

1158
01:11:57,933 --> 01:12:00,868
Hey just because you bought me coffee
doesn't mean you can walk all over me!

1159
01:12:01,770 --> 01:12:02,862
Mogambi!

1160
01:12:03,405 --> 01:12:05,396
Tommy! - Why don't you
tear all my hair out?

1161
01:12:05,507 --> 01:12:06,735
I could take you
waxing... less painful...

1162
01:12:10,178 --> 01:12:14,877
me? Stranger? What
about you? Invisible.

1163
01:12:16,284 --> 01:12:19,776
Invisible? Nah just busy...

1164
01:12:31,433 --> 01:12:32,525
what?

1165
01:13:13,842 --> 01:13:16,208
I don't get it. I just don't get it.

1166
01:13:16,611 --> 01:13:18,203
Our chats have suddenly changed.

1167
01:13:18,279 --> 01:13:19,541
It's like... she's not
interested in me anymore.

1168
01:13:19,981 --> 01:13:21,073
So damn weird

1169
01:13:21,149 --> 01:13:22,980
stop pmsing like a girl...

1170
01:13:23,084 --> 01:13:24,415
she must be busy or something.
Forget it.

1171
01:13:24,819 --> 01:13:27,310
No man... we used to be
on chat a hell of a lot.

1172
01:13:27,389 --> 01:13:29,516
All right! Hey look...

1173
01:13:29,591 --> 01:13:31,491
your real profile is sweeter
than your facebook profile

1174
01:13:33,294 --> 01:13:34,386
i'll see you later okay?

1175
01:13:37,132 --> 01:13:39,259
Hey machoman!

1176
01:13:39,701 --> 01:13:40,793
You're welcome!

1177
01:13:41,136 --> 01:13:42,262
For?

1178
01:13:42,570 --> 01:13:44,663
You forgot to thank us bro...

1179
01:13:44,773 --> 01:13:47,264
oh shit... actually you know,
that day i told you

1180
01:13:47,342 --> 01:13:49,173
i liked her and then you
sent her that friend request...

1181
01:13:49,411 --> 01:13:51,971
but after that i didn't get
a reply from her for weeks

1182
01:13:52,547 --> 01:13:54,515
then i thought really hard

1183
01:13:54,849 --> 01:13:58,842
i mean, what's the point in lying
about yourself on chat or on the net?

1184
01:13:59,254 --> 01:14:00,687
It's best to just tell the
truth and be yourself, face to face

1185
01:14:00,755 --> 01:14:01,881
so that's what i did

1186
01:14:01,956 --> 01:14:04,618
at first she laughed... then
started talking to me gradually

1187
01:14:05,293 --> 01:14:06,590
she said she liked my honesty

1188
01:14:06,695 --> 01:14:09,289
now you sneaky bugger
be honest with me...

1189
01:14:09,397 --> 01:14:12,127

01:14:27,382 --> 01:14:28,576

1219
01:16:49,958 --> 01:16:51,425
Obviously. - What is wrong with you?

1220
01:16:51,526 --> 01:16:52,584

1222

1223
01:16:57,332 --> 01:17:00,301
anyone would be upset! I'm a
booty girl?! What the hell??

1224
01:17:00,568 --> 01:17:02,126
Okay, and what about the stunt you
pulled on machoman... his video...

1225
01:17:02,203 --> 01:17:03,363
what about that?

1226
01:17:03,471 --> 01:17:04,597
Stop being so bloody
sentimental suddenly!

1227
01:17:04,706 --> 01:17:06,333
You go right now and
tell her you did this!

1228
01:17:07,542 --> 01:17:08,839
You must be out of your mind...

1229
01:17:08,943 --> 01:17:10,467
you want her to know?
Then you tell her!

1230
01:17:28,263 --> 01:17:30,231
Pree... hey preity!

1231
01:17:30,732 --> 01:17:32,666
There's a new message from
rahul... you didn't read it?

1232
01:17:33,034 --> 01:17:35,502
Didn't find the time. Read it aloud.

1233
01:17:36,604 --> 01:17:37,798
What if it's personal?

1234
01:17:39,607 --> 01:17:44,510
Okay... saturday's yours,
birthday's mine,

1235
01:17:44,846 --> 01:17:47,508

the beers for me,

1236
01:17:47,615 --> 01:17:49,640
the time is 10.30,
the venue is my house.

1237
01:17:49,751 --> 01:17:52,720
Ps. Bring preity, your friend,
my photographer.

1238
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:54,185
Hey sounds like fun!

1239
01:17:55,556 --> 01:17:56,648
Pree?

1240
01:17:58,793 --> 01:17:59,919
What's up with you?

1241
01:18:01,462 --> 01:18:02,554
Nothing

1242
01:18:03,998 --> 01:18:05,295
that vishal...

1243
01:18:05,867 --> 01:18:08,335
vishal again? I thought
you guys were friends finally

1244
01:18:10,104 --> 01:18:11,469
that's what i thought as well...

1245
01:18:12,774 --> 01:18:13,968
but i was wrong

1246
01:18:14,642 --> 01:18:17,202
they're all the
same... how could i forget?

1247
01:18:20,214 --> 01:18:21,579
Rahul's not the same

1248
01:18:21,649 --> 01:18:23,207
i know! On the net and
chat he's one person

1249
01:18:23,318 --> 01:18:24,546
and in real life he's
like someone else...

1250
01:18:24,619 --> 01:18:26,246
it's almost like
he's not the same person

1251
01:18:26,788 --> 01:18:27,846
what're you trting to say?

1252
01:18:27,956 --> 01:18:29,287
I don't know... he's boring!

1253
01:18:29,390 --> 01:18:30,482
What?

1254
01:18:31,359 --> 01:18:32,849
I mean... really?

1255
01:18:33,494 --> 01:18:35,860
Does that mean you're not
interested in him anymore?

1256
01:18:35,964 --> 01:18:37,056
Maybe not

1257
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:42,661
actually... you know what?

1258
01:18:44,238 --> 01:18:45,500
I know i'm not interested in him.

1259
01:18:46,541 --> 01:18:49,806
So... what if someone
else was interested?

1260
01:18:49,877 --> 01:18:51,310
Who? One of his college fans?

1261
01:18:51,379 --> 01:18:55,748
No... just... anyone...

1262
01:18:59,954 --> 01:19:01,080
malu?

1263
01:19:03,791 --> 01:19:04,917
I'm really sorrt!

1264
01:19:05,026 --> 01:19:06,323
For what? - I think i like him!

1265
01:19:06,427 --> 01:19:08,895
Rvert time we met, we hit it off,
but i thought you liked him so...

1266
01:19:08,963 --> 01:19:10,260
you funny girl you!

1267
01:19:10,365 --> 01:19:12,196
Why didn't you tell me earlier??
- How could i?

1268
01:19:12,367 --> 01:19:13,459
I thought you liked him!

1269
01:19:13,568 --> 01:19:16,002
If i hadn't said anything you would've
done a filmy sacrifice like this??

1270
01:19:16,604 --> 01:19:17,662
I guess...

1271
01:19:17,772 --> 01:19:20,104
malu you idiot...
i liked rahul as a concept...

1272
01:19:20,208 --> 01:19:23,575
i fell for his songs...
his writing... not him as a person

1273
01:19:23,778 --> 01:19:27,839
the only connection between me
and rahul was a broadband one.

1274
01:19:28,416 --> 01:19:30,543
Hail mother preity!

1275
01:19:30,752 --> 01:19:32,549
May you be blessed with a
hundred boyfriends my dear!!

1276
01:19:32,620 --> 01:19:33,780
You sure?

1277
01:19:33,855 --> 01:19:35,720
Of course i'm sure! I'm
not as benevolent as you are!

1278
01:19:36,290 --> 01:19:37,587
Hey so can we go to
his birthday party then?

1279
01:19:39,293 --> 01:19:40,385

1293
01:20:30,078 --> 01:20:31,602

1294
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:33,908
go tell her for god's sake!

1295
01:20:35,316 --> 01:20:37,841
What? You want me to
propose to malvika?!

1296
01:20:38,052 --> 01:20:39,519
You're already
pretending to be rahul...

1297
01:20:39,587 --> 01:20:41,077
and now you want me to pretend
to be you?! Are you crazy?!!

1298
01:20:41,189 --> 01:20:42,986
Not malvika you ass! Preity!

1299
01:20:43,057 --> 01:20:45,548
Go tell her it was you who made
that booty mms and uploaded it

1300
01:20:45,626 --> 01:20:46,786
she's not talking to me dude

1301
01:20:46,894 --> 01:20:49,226
so? You came here to
chat up malvika, not preity!

1302
01:20:49,564 --> 01:20:50,724
And what about all these
people drinking free booze...

1303
01:20:50,798 --> 01:20:51,924
...that poor rahul's paying for!

1304
01:20:52,066 --> 01:20:54,398
Don't think so much.
You're not used to it!

1305
01:20:54,469 --> 01:20:55,663
Just do what you came here to do!

1306
01:20:55,770 --> 01:20:56,896
Talk to malvika

1307
01:20:57,505 --> 01:20:59,905

1308
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:05,638
Best of luck!

1311
01:21:15,690 --> 01:21:16,816
You're such an ass

1312
01:21:17,892 --> 01:21:20,918

Really guys, why don't you save
this sibling rivalrt for later?

1316
01:21:25,967 --> 01:21:27,059
Hey...

1317
01:21:29,937 --> 01:21:31,632
its nothing major but...

1318
01:21:34,609 --> 01:21:35,667
chicken!

1319
01:21:37,378 --> 01:21:40,108
Preity that booty
mms doing the rounds?

1320
01:21:40,515 --> 01:21:42,710
Hacky made it and
circulated it, not vishal.

1321
01:21:43,718 --> 01:21:45,879
You're just protecting him.
- Why would i do that?

1322
01:21:45,987 --> 01:21:47,215
Because he's your friend.

1323
01:21:47,321 --> 01:21:49,653
News flash! Hacky's my brother.

1324
01:21:54,362 --> 01:21:55,920
Unfortunate but true.

1325
01:22:06,307 --> 01:22:07,433
You're such an ass!

1326
01:22:07,875 --> 01:22:09,103
Yuck... no vodka in this!

1327
01:22:21,689 --> 01:22:22,849

1329
01:22:26,294 --> 01:22:28,228
I thought you were pissed off

1330
01:22:28,696 --> 01:22:29,822
i still am

1331
01:22:30,331 --> 01:22:31,423
what's wrong with you?

1332
01:22:31,532 --> 01:22:34,092
Couldn't you tell me earlier that you
didn't make that video or upload it?

1333
01:22:34,202 --> 01:22:36,966
In case you didn't notice,
i was trting to...

1334
01:22:37,338 --> 01:22:38,430
but you didn't give me a chance!

1335
01:22:38,539 --> 01:22:40,666
So? Trt harder. You know me...

1336
01:22:40,975 --> 01:22:42,101
i'm like that

1337
01:22:42,777 --> 01:22:43,903

01:22:43,978 --> 01:22:45,639
hey and you? Tommy!

1339
01:22:46,013 --> 01:22:47,310
You totally screwed my happiness!

1340
01:22:47,415 --> 01:22:48,507
Serves you right!

1341
01:22:57,058 --> 01:22:58,616
I need a beer. You want one?

1342
01:22:59,026 --> 01:23:00,152
Okay

1343
01:23:02,230 --> 01:23:03,458

1344
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:06,857

a broadband connection

1345
01:23:09,437 --> 01:23:10,597

1346
01:23:11,439 --> 01:23:13,600

that's empty, rusted, old with dents

1387

You know i like
malvika... and despite that you

1454
01:27:52,353 --> 01:27:54,821
what kind of a friend are you
rahul? - One second one second...

1455
01:27:55,322 --> 01:27:57,381
you, me... when did this happen?

1456
01:27:57,591 --> 01:28:01,220
It's been a while. In fact, malvika

1457
01:28:01,295 --> 01:28:03,889
i'm sorrt, i should
have told you ages ago

1458
01:28:04,164 --> 01:28:07,600
the friend request on facebook
from rahul, i sent it, from his id

1459
01:28:08,636 --> 01:28:12,037
all those conversations, that
connection, it was with me malvika

1460
01:28:12,306 --> 01:28:13,432
no. - What?

1461
01:28:14,642 --> 01:28:16,473
Malvika wasn't chatting with anyone

1462
01:28:16,544 --> 01:28:18,136
what do you mean? I have proof

1463
01:28:18,345 --> 01:28:20,176
ask rahul... there
are tons of messages

1464
01:28:20,681 --> 01:28:23,741
not from malvika. Me

1465
01:28:24,285 --> 01:28:29,552
what? I don't understand... i... what?

1466
01:28:29,623 --> 01:28:32,114
I should've known... that you
would've done something like this

1467
01:28:32,927 --> 01:28:35,919
i can't believe that all this while,
i was talking and chatting with you

1468
01:28:37,031 --> 01:28:39,761
pretty funny huh? And me?

1469
01:28:41,101 --> 01:28:42,329
Pretty dumb

1470
01:28:43,837 --> 01:28:45,634
you must've had a good laugh huh?
Making a fool out of someone?

1471
01:28:45,706 --> 01:28:47,333
Whoa whoa... you made a fool
of me as well, don't forget!

1472
01:28:47,675 --> 01:28:50,143
Trust me. If i'd known that
i was communicating with you

1473
01:28:50,444 --> 01:28:51,775
i would've never
continued writing to you!

1474
01:28:51,845 --> 01:28:53,005
Well same here!

1475
01:28:53,113 --> 01:28:54,944
I don't know how i
could've been so stupid...

1476
01:28:55,015 --> 01:28:56,243
as to suddenly start
thinking well of you!

1477
01:28:56,650 --> 01:28:58,982
I was better earlier,
when i didn't trust anyone

1478
01:28:59,119 --> 01:29:01,246
of all the people, i trusted you!

1479
01:29:01,422 --> 01:29:02,684
You're not the only one in
this godforsaken situation!

1480
01:29:02,756 --> 01:29:04,781
Why're you playing the solo victim
here? - I'm not playing victim here

1481
01:29:04,858 --> 01:29:06,450
but you're behaving like
one -just shut up vishal

1482
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:08,619
what's wrong with you...
why're you overreacting

1483
01:29:08,696 --> 01:29:10,220
because like a fool
i was falling in io...

1484
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:13,726
pree...

1485
01:30:03,117 --> 01:30:04,209
preity...

1486
01:30:06,286 --> 01:30:07,378
preity...

1487
01:30:45,426 --> 01:30:46,552
coffee?

1488
01:30:51,699 --> 01:30:52,859
I know you're angrt

1489
01:30:53,133 --> 01:30:55,328
you have no idea.
- Do you? What?

1490
01:30:55,769 --> 01:30:57,202
Have any idea what you're doing?

1491
01:30:57,271 --> 01:30:59,205
I'm not kissing my best
friend's girlfriend for sure

1492
01:30:59,573 --> 01:31:00,870
malvika's not your girlfriend.

1493
01:31:01,108 --> 01:31:03,576
Sure... she found rahul the rock star

1494
01:31:05,913 --> 01:31:07,904
fine i will... but i've
got a question for you

1495
01:31:08,215 --> 01:31:09,739
you had a party for
malvika last night...

1496
01:31:09,817 --> 01:31:11,307
but you kept chasing
preity all through the party

1497
01:31:11,418 --> 01:31:12,476
because she was upset!

1498
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:15,484
So it was more important to make up
with preity than to win over malvika

1499
01:31:15,756 --> 01:31:17,656
what're you most angrt about?
That preity...

1500
01:31:17,725 --> 01:31:19,386
who cares about preity man?

1501
01:31:19,460 --> 01:31:21,655
You! All the while that
she was angrt with you

1502
01:31:21,762 --> 01:31:22,888
you were walking
around like you were

1503
01:31:22,963 --> 01:31:24,157
a part of the return
of the zombie part 2

1504
01:31:24,398 --> 01:31:26,730
and soon as you guys made up,
your batteries got super charged!!

1505
01:31:26,934 --> 01:31:28,959
Bullshit! Stop with this
freudian nonsense and forget preity

1506
01:31:29,036 --> 01:31:30,503
why did you kiss malvika huh?

1507
01:31:30,838 --> 01:31:32,465
I like her. And she likes me

1508
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:35,931
more importantly malvika
told me everything... the truth

1509
01:31:36,410 --> 01:31:37,536
and that's the key word 'truth'

1510
01:31:37,845 --> 01:31:40,473
you love someone,
be honest with them

1511
01:31:40,781 --> 01:31:42,009
and that's what malvika did,
told me that

1512
01:31:42,249 --> 01:31:44,945
all this while preity was writing
and communication from her id

1513
01:31:45,219 --> 01:31:47,050
you were talking to preity
this whole time, not malvika

1514
01:31:47,488 --> 01:31:52,585
your connection was
with preity, not malvika

1515
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:54,218
got that?

1516
01:31:55,162 --> 01:31:56,288
Food for thought

1517
01:32:15,582 --> 01:32:16,674
vishal where the hell are you?

1518
01:32:16,750 --> 01:32:18,547
Raghbir's been looking
for you! Hurrt up...

1519
01:32:20,988 --> 01:32:24,424
vish, i need your help to
sort out these badges...

1520
01:32:25,592 --> 01:32:27,184
god this is never going to get over!

1521
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:36,492
Hey preity hurrt up!

1522
01:32:36,804 --> 01:32:38,203
Been waiting for you for ages!

1523
01:33:00,661 --> 01:33:01,753
Vishal

1524
01:33:03,530 --> 01:33:04,963
how many copies have
you made of the dvd?

1525
01:33:05,032 --> 01:33:06,192
'Cause raghubir wanted a backup

1526
01:33:08,869 --> 01:33:09,995
preity

1527
01:33:10,537 --> 01:33:13,506
yeah listen do a sound check please,
the levels might be off after the play

1528
01:33:13,740 --> 01:33:16,641
i'll see you
backstage in an hour? Bye...

1529
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:47,766
you know its okay

1530
01:33:49,042 --> 01:33:50,373
it's not your fault

1531
01:33:51,211 --> 01:33:52,735
you did exactly what i did

1532
01:33:53,647 --> 01:33:56,081
i totally
overreacted at the party...

1533
01:33:57,017 --> 01:34:00,316
it's just that i fell for you

1534
01:34:01,255 --> 01:34:02,586
actually fell in love with you

1535
01:34:04,191 --> 01:34:05,920
don't worrt, it's not
your problem or your fault

1536
01:34:06,260 --> 01:34:09,991
it's just me. Obviously you
love malvika... who wouldn't.

1537
01:34:10,364 --> 01:34:12,958
And you know me... stupid, mogambi

1538
01:34:13,267 --> 01:34:15,360
i end up doing silly stuff...
randomly, tactlessly.

1539
01:34:15,702 --> 01:34:18,728
This whole love thing as well,
without thinking

1540
01:34:19,506 --> 01:34:21,770
so basically what i'm
saying is, no stress

1541
01:34:21,875 --> 01:34:24,173
just ignore everything.
I'll get over it

1542
01:34:24,578 --> 01:34:26,705
it's my problem. I'll deal with it

1543
01:34:43,864 --> 01:34:44,990
we cool?

1544
01:34:45,999 --> 01:34:47,091
Chill...

1545
01:34:56,710 --> 01:34:59,645
love...

1546
01:35:00,247 --> 01:35:02,442
is as much a part of
college as bunking...

1547
01:35:02,616 --> 01:35:06,677
unpaid canteen bills,
proxy or sleeping in class

1548
01:35:07,821 --> 01:35:11,723
so tonight we're going to
talk about 25 love stories

1549
01:35:11,959 --> 01:35:13,426
that began right here in
college and are still going strong

1550
01:35:17,998 --> 01:35:19,090
vishal...

1551
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:20,992
vishal...

1552
01:35:21,902 --> 01:35:24,200
vishal!! Hacky! What is going on?

1553
01:35:24,738 --> 01:35:26,205
I don't know ma'am...

1554
01:35:26,473 --> 01:35:29,271
did you change something in
the order of things... no ma'am

1555
01:35:29,343 --> 01:35:30,674
some people fell in
love at first sight...

1556
01:35:30,777 --> 01:35:32,369
and some people took three
years to realize their feelings

1557
01:35:32,679 --> 01:35:34,579
some folks blurted their feelings
out at the first chance they got...

1558
01:35:34,848 --> 01:35:36,076
and some kept their
emotions to themselves

1559
01:35:36,483 --> 01:35:37,950
they just let their
eyes do all the talking

1560
01:35:38,652 --> 01:35:40,745
back then, they knew how to love

1561
01:35:41,388 --> 01:35:44,755
they figured out how to voice and
express the matters of the heart

1562
01:35:45,158 --> 01:35:48,753
that's why some love stories,
are forever. Like these...

1563
01:35:54,167 --> 01:35:55,293
you're right

1564
01:35:57,170 --> 01:35:59,195
there was no
internet in those days...

1565
01:36:00,707 --> 01:36:04,268
no sms... short messaging service.

1566
01:36:04,444 --> 01:36:05,536
Here you go!

1567
01:36:06,346 --> 01:36:08,541
In short how would you say
those thousands of things...

1568
01:36:08,749 --> 01:36:10,046
that were dying to be articulated?!

1569
01:36:10,117 --> 01:36:12,017
Is this part of the
whole thing? - No ma'am...

1570
01:36:12,119 --> 01:36:13,609
a smiley doesn't have the
same effect a real smile has...

1571
01:36:14,388 --> 01:36:17,585
when shared between two eager faces
across the length of a classroom

1572
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:22,388
rarlier one hid from teachers,
parents...

1573
01:36:22,796 --> 01:36:24,661
and even other students
whilst in the throes of romance

1574
01:36:25,032 --> 01:36:28,126
today we end up pursuing love
whilst hiding from each other

1575
01:36:29,403 --> 01:36:30,768
instead of hiding
behind librart shelves

1576
01:36:30,837 --> 01:36:32,270
...and trees like our seniors did...

1577
01:36:32,973 --> 01:36:37,307
today we can face each other yet
choose to hide behind computer screens

1578
01:36:38,045 --> 01:36:40,206
love happens real fast like the
speed of an internet connection...

1579
01:36:40,914 --> 01:36:42,711
and logs out equally easily

1580
01:36:43,216 --> 01:36:44,843
i mean think about it...

1581
01:36:45,285 --> 01:36:47,082
how can you actually
fall in love with...

1582
01:36:47,387 --> 01:36:49,355
...a display picture
or clever bio line?

1583
01:36:50,390 --> 01:36:56,295
You fall in love with a living
breathing fighting, angrt, complex...

1584
01:36:56,563 --> 01:37:01,330
complicated, sweet,
idiotic pretty amazing girl

1585
01:37:03,370 --> 01:37:05,998
yes friends, there is a
26th love stort as well...

1586
01:37:06,373 --> 01:37:10,104
but it won't work out with a
simple fraaandship request

1587
01:37:11,945 --> 01:37:14,175
for it to work one
would have to look...

1588
01:37:14,247 --> 01:37:17,216
...into her eyes and
walk towards her...

1589
01:37:18,752 --> 01:37:20,049
go down on one knee

1590
01:37:20,454 --> 01:37:21,648
vishal's gone crazy!

1591
01:37:22,989 --> 01:37:24,251
And speak the truth...

1592
01:37:27,194 --> 01:37:29,458
you're in my heart
and even my liver!

1593
01:37:30,664 --> 01:37:32,632
You're the fever that
strikes now or any time...

1594
01:37:33,867 --> 01:37:36,267
you're the one who'll
be in my life forever

1595
01:37:41,141 --> 01:37:42,233
preity...

1596
01:37:46,046 --> 01:37:47,172
i love you

1597
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:54,612

1599

1600
01:37:59,192 --> 01:38:02,252

1601
01:38:02,429 --> 01:38:03,589
reoww. - What!

1602
01:38:03,830 --> 01:38:05,058
At least i'm being honest!

1603
01:38:05,398 --> 01:38:06,592
From today... only the truth!

1604
01:38:07,033 --> 01:38:08,830
I watch girls... from
the hostel balcony.

1605
01:38:09,369 --> 01:38:12,133
I watch porn
also... and that's not all...

1606
01:38:12,672 --> 01:38:13,900
those pansy songs that rahul sings?

1607
01:38:15,108 --> 01:38:16,268
I write them

1608
01:38:16,710 --> 01:38:19,042
what? Really? Why
didn't you tell me earlier

1609
01:38:19,679 --> 01:38:22,147

1610
01:38:22,616 --> 01:38:23,708

01:38:30,490 --> 01:38:32,390
That's called the power of love!

1614
01:38:33,193 --> 01:38:35,320
Somebody call the principal!

1615
01:38:35,395 --> 01:38:36,794
I'm telling you i think
its all part of the show...

1616
01:38:36,897 --> 01:38:39,388

1617
01:38:43,703 --> 01:38:48,640
