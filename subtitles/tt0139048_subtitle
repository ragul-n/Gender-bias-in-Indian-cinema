1
00:02:24,486 --> 00:02:28,638
''Swings have been hung for, 
monsoon is here''

2
00:02:37,887 --> 00:02:41,960
''A desire awakens in the heart. . . 
Oh goodness''

3
00:02:42,407 --> 00:02:46,286
''Swings have been hung for, 
monsoon is here''

4
00:03:11,646 --> 00:03:15,480
''The ecstatic breeze kiss my cheeks''

5
00:03:16,287 --> 00:03:19,836
''And the raindrops play on my body''

6
00:03:22,727 --> 00:03:26,640
''The raindrops, heavy on the 
clouds, make them droop. . . ''

7
00:03:27,287 --> 00:03:31,121
''to kiss my feet''

8
00:03:33,486 --> 00:03:37,001
''When the clouds get heavy, 
they droop down to kiss my feet''

9
00:03:37,326 --> 00:03:41,956
''Goodness! How they melt me''

10
00:04:11,486 --> 00:04:15,320
''It's a mischievous season of songs''

11
00:04:15,766 --> 00:04:19,680
''You will find swings everywhere''

12
00:04:22,487 --> 00:04:28,483
''In such a weather, I wish I 
could find someone to rock me''

13
00:04:32,887 --> 00:04:36,482
''In such a weather, I wish I 
could find someone to rock me''

14
00:04:37,367 --> 00:04:41,406
''Who would never take his 
hands off tender wrist''

15
00:04:41,846 --> 00:04:45,680
''Swings have been hung for, 
monsoon is here''

16
00:04:48,286 --> 00:04:52,120
''A desire awakens in the heart. . . 
Oh goodness''

17
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:56,486
''Swings have been hung for, 
monsoon is here''

18
00:05:07,567 --> 00:05:10,843
Stop it! What a racket 
you're creating.

19
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,718
Don't you dare touch me. 
Go home, all of you.

20
00:05:18,127 --> 00:05:19,480
Oh my God !

21
00:05:21,687 --> 00:05:24,485
Zeenat, have you gone crazy?

22
00:05:24,846 --> 00:05:28,122
What if you catch a cold?

23
00:05:28,487 --> 00:05:30,159
You are too much, aunt!

24
00:05:30,487 --> 00:05:33,126
Am I made of mud that I'll 
melt away the moment I get soaked?

25
00:05:33,487 --> 00:05:38,480
Ask that from my heart which has 
cared for you since you were born.

26
00:05:38,966 --> 00:05:41,480
If your mother was alive, 
she would have been shocked.

27
00:05:41,846 --> 00:05:43,837
Come home quick and change 
your clothes.

28
00:05:44,206 --> 00:05:46,959
You also go home now. They all just 
come here to waste their time.

29
00:05:49,487 --> 00:05:51,478
Aunt Kariman is really too much.

30
00:06:07,286 --> 00:06:10,596
Damn him! He's always 
shouting away to glory.

31
00:06:11,047 --> 00:06:14,039
Honestly Zeenat, I don't 
like this man at all.

32
00:06:14,447 --> 00:06:16,483
Who, aunt? - That stupid man, Aachchan.

33
00:06:18,406 --> 00:06:20,966
God knows what the Nawab saw in him. . .

34
00:06:21,326 --> 00:06:23,317
that he gave him half the house on rent.

35
00:06:24,487 --> 00:06:26,523
God knows why you don't like him.

36
00:06:26,927 --> 00:06:29,157
Since he has come, there's 
so much gaiety around here.

37
00:06:29,487 --> 00:06:31,318
Oh sure!

38
00:06:32,286 --> 00:06:34,880
I feel like pulling him by the 
ear and throwing him out.

39
00:06:35,286 --> 00:06:38,164
Here, change your clothes and go up 
on the terrace and dry your hair. . .

40
00:06:38,487 --> 00:06:40,842
or if you get a headache, 
you'll trouble me.

41
00:06:41,206 --> 00:06:44,483
My sweet aunt, I feel like 
having delicacies today.

42
00:06:45,286 --> 00:06:50,235
Delicacies, indeed ! Only I 
know how I run the house.

43
00:06:50,607 --> 00:06:53,121
There you go again !

44
00:06:53,487 --> 00:06:55,478
Whatever our financial condition, 
we are royal Nawabs after all.

45
00:06:55,726 --> 00:06:58,161
And then, father has gone to 
collect his pension.

46
00:06:58,487 --> 00:07:02,116
He will bring home money today. 
- As if he'll bring loads of money.

47
00:07:02,487 --> 00:07:04,318
He gets only Rs. 20.

48
00:07:04,687 --> 00:07:07,918
That too, after disbursing the 
money among servants and clerks. . .

49
00:07:08,286 --> 00:07:10,925
the remaining Rs. 1 or 2 is conned 
out of him by the rickshaw-puller.

50
00:07:11,286 --> 00:07:14,198
The Nawab has gone empty handed 
and will return empty handed.

51
00:07:14,526 --> 00:07:16,483
If you wish, shall I cook 
' Kichdi' for you?

52
00:07:17,567 --> 00:07:22,595
Don't call it by such a bland name.

53
00:07:23,286 --> 00:07:25,641
After all, it should sound like royal food.

54
00:07:32,487 --> 00:07:34,284
What are you doing?

55
00:07:52,846 --> 00:07:57,601
My throat's gone dry screaming, 
and you don't even bother to reply.

56
00:07:58,487 --> 00:08:04,198
Please speak softly, he has 
just slept after a crying bout.

57
00:08:05,326 --> 00:08:09,206
Who? - My Dilawarjang.

58
00:08:10,047 --> 00:08:15,167
He got wet in the rain, caught 
a cold and then pneumonia.

59
00:08:15,567 --> 00:08:19,276
He's going to die, only God can save him.

60
00:08:19,687 --> 00:08:24,715
You are strange! I thought it 
was your young brother or nephew. . .

61
00:08:25,127 --> 00:08:28,483
whom you are carrying in your lap. 
- He is everything to me.

62
00:08:29,047 --> 00:08:31,117
You don't know him.

63
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:35,162
He has achieved such great feats, 
that I've become famous. . .

64
00:08:35,486 --> 00:08:38,796
in every street of Lucknow. 
Now if this cock. . .

65
00:08:39,206 --> 00:08:43,165
Look, if you don't like 
my coming here,. . .

66
00:08:43,486 --> 00:08:46,478
you can continue to care for your 
cock, I'm leaving. Good bye!

67
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:53,116
Wait! Will you also give 
me a shock and kill me?

68
00:08:53,486 --> 00:08:54,475
Sit down.

69
00:08:56,486 --> 00:09:00,957
Tell me, earlier, 
you visited me very rarely.

70
00:09:01,486 --> 00:09:03,716
Nowadays, you visit me quiet often.

71
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:06,162
That's because of the 'paan' you offer me.

72
00:09:06,486 --> 00:09:09,478
You have got me so habituated to it, 
that I must have it every day.

73
00:09:10,966 --> 00:09:16,485
Your ' paan' is simply divine.

74
00:09:17,647 --> 00:09:20,002
Don't waste time, go and get it quick.

75
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:25,003
And listen, tell Banarasi to 
take his time but make it well. . .

76
00:09:25,447 --> 00:09:28,802
or he'll ruin its taste. - All right.

77
00:09:29,206 --> 00:09:31,960
Just look after my Dilawarjang. - Don't worry.

78
00:09:32,326 --> 00:09:35,797
Just keep blowing into his beak every two minutes.

79
00:09:36,486 --> 00:09:41,116
If he sneezes, hold him close and sleep on your stomach.

80
00:09:41,486 --> 00:09:44,876
He'll stay warm that way. I'll get him his medicine too by then.

81
00:09:45,287 --> 00:09:46,480
Go, hurry.

82
00:10:15,807 --> 00:10:17,479
Rain in the sun?

83
00:10:23,486 --> 00:10:27,195
''As she wrung water out of her hair. . . ''

84
00:10:27,807 --> 00:10:31,481
''the euphoric clouds Rained down in glee''

85
00:10:33,486 --> 00:10:36,284
''And the cloudburst. . . ''

86
00:10:36,647 --> 00:10:39,559
''sets my heart on fire''

87
00:10:40,447 --> 00:10:41,481
Marvellous!

88
00:10:43,486 --> 00:10:44,475
Good God !

89
00:10:45,567 --> 00:10:47,602
Hey, what's this? - Hello!

90
00:10:50,486 --> 00:10:54,480
Please go away, if my father sees you here, he'll bury me alive.

91
00:10:57,807 --> 00:10:59,877
Then why did you greet me?

92
00:11:00,287 --> 00:11:02,278
I only greeted you, I didn't call you here.

93
00:11:02,647 --> 00:11:07,596
Why did you sprinkle the dew drops of love from your silky hair on me?

94
00:11:08,486 --> 00:11:10,477
All right, I made a mistake, forgive me.

95
00:11:10,846 --> 00:11:13,121
But please go away, you'll do me a favour.

96
00:11:13,486 --> 00:11:14,475
Favour?

97
00:11:15,366 --> 00:11:17,482
It is me who is hoping for a favour.

98
00:11:18,287 --> 00:11:22,485
I can't wait anymore, think of some way we can meet.

99
00:11:23,287 --> 00:11:25,846
Or I'll die of heartbreak.

100
00:11:26,287 --> 00:11:28,562
Don't say that, I don't want you to die.

101
00:11:28,966 --> 00:11:34,040
Then gift me life, promise me you'll meet me today evening.

102
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:38,365
Today? But I've to attend Bilkis' engagement today.

103
00:11:38,927 --> 00:11:41,157
Then meet me tomorrow evening, day after tomorrow. . .

104
00:11:41,486 --> 00:11:45,240
or any other beautiful evening, but do promise you'll meet me.

105
00:11:45,606 --> 00:11:48,598
Oh God, you are going crazy.

106
00:11:49,527 --> 00:11:52,644
It's you who's made me go crazy. - Me?

107
00:11:54,687 --> 00:11:57,759
Wrong. That's a lie.

108
00:11:58,366 --> 00:12:03,043
Oh yes. Who had put chilies in my ' paan' on Salma's wedding?

109
00:12:03,606 --> 00:12:06,882
And who sent me a handkerchief as a gift through Razia?

110
00:12:07,647 --> 00:12:10,844
Who had come suddenly before me on Fakruddin's birthday?

111
00:12:11,486 --> 00:12:15,081
You didn't do anything, I've simply gone crazy.

112
00:12:15,486 --> 00:12:20,480
All right, I'm terribly sorry, I'll never make those mistakes again.

113
00:12:20,886 --> 00:12:26,085
''After killing me she says she's sorry''

114
00:12:27,287 --> 00:12:30,006
''But of what use is her repentence now''

115
00:12:31,486 --> 00:12:35,240
Oh God, my father has come, please go, run !

116
00:12:35,606 --> 00:12:37,677
Not there, go from here.

117
00:12:39,486 --> 00:12:41,204
But where will we meet?

118
00:12:41,486 --> 00:12:44,683
If father sees us, then we'll meet in heaven. Go!

119
00:12:45,486 --> 00:12:46,966
Bend down.

120
00:13:05,447 --> 00:13:10,076
The ' banarasi paan', the silver foil on it. . .

121
00:13:10,486 --> 00:13:14,718
makes you swoon ! You've got habituated to it!

122
00:13:15,366 --> 00:13:19,075
Ask him to take his time making it!

123
00:13:19,486 --> 00:13:22,081
And this is what you're upto?

124
00:13:22,486 --> 00:13:26,480
Is this what you're habituated to? - No, this was only. . .

125
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,605
Look Yusuf, decent people reside here.

126
00:13:30,966 --> 00:13:34,276
If anyone had seen you, I'd have earned ill-repute.

127
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:38,162
Take me for example, I've been living here since so long.

128
00:13:38,486 --> 00:13:41,603
But I've never dared to look that way.

129
00:13:41,966 --> 00:13:45,276
Not just me, take my cock, Dilawar. . .

130
00:13:45,687 --> 00:13:49,201
who is so young and handsome.

131
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:54,163
Kariman's hen comes everyday and woos him.

132
00:13:54,486 --> 00:14:00,482
But her antics don't affect him.

133
00:14:00,886 --> 00:14:03,354
That's what I call decency.

134
00:14:03,767 --> 00:14:06,964
Tell me, isn't my cock better than you?

135
00:14:07,366 --> 00:14:11,041
Stop it now, why are you bent on humiliating me? It was a mistake.

136
00:14:11,407 --> 00:14:15,115
Tell me honestly, when did it start?

137
00:14:15,486 --> 00:14:19,115
Truly speaking, eating ' paan' was only an excuse.

138
00:14:19,486 --> 00:14:22,284
Her attraction draws me here. Today I became so desperate. . .

139
00:14:22,647 --> 00:14:26,480
that I went up to meet her. - Luckily her father didn't see you.

140
00:14:27,006 --> 00:14:30,157
The old man is sure a simple man, but so self-respecting. . .

141
00:14:30,486 --> 00:14:32,682
that he'd have killed you and himself too.

142
00:14:34,086 --> 00:14:35,997
Did you get your pension? - Yes.

143
00:14:36,326 --> 00:14:37,840
Give it to me.

144
00:14:38,407 --> 00:14:42,115
I got only Rs. 20, but had to pay Rs. 22.

145
00:14:42,486 --> 00:14:44,204
I still have to pay Rs. 2.

146
00:14:44,606 --> 00:14:47,996
Zeenat, should I cook ' Kichdi' even today?

147
00:14:48,527 --> 00:14:52,725
Aunt, why do you always have to taunt?

148
00:14:53,287 --> 00:14:56,562
Don't worry child, so what if my pension money is over.

149
00:14:57,006 --> 00:15:00,157
Aachchan has to pay us rent of 6 months.

150
00:15:00,486 --> 00:15:04,081
I'll go get the money from him. - Oh sure he'll give you !

151
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,721
He'll never pay you and you'll never ask him for it.

152
00:15:07,126 --> 00:15:08,878
And then you say I taunt.

153
00:15:09,126 --> 00:15:11,959
But she isn't attracted to me.

154
00:15:12,366 --> 00:15:15,756
She gets irked if I ask her to meet me alone. Do something for me. . .

155
00:15:16,126 --> 00:15:19,596
or you'll be responsible for my death. - Oh great!

156
00:15:20,126 --> 00:15:24,120
She's killed you and I'll be blamed for your death?

157
00:15:24,486 --> 00:15:29,480
Doesn't matter, anything for a friend.

158
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:33,077
Since you are in it now, I'll have to think of something.

159
00:15:33,647 --> 00:15:36,480
Tell me, does she go anywhere?

160
00:15:38,366 --> 00:15:43,486
She told me she'll be attending Bilkis' engagement today evening.

161
00:15:43,846 --> 00:15:48,682
Really? I'll definitely do something then.

162
00:15:57,126 --> 00:15:58,718
Take care of your veil.

163
00:16:00,287 --> 00:16:01,276
Come on !

164
00:16:17,527 --> 00:16:21,964
Stop! There is danger ahead, don't go any further.

165
00:16:22,366 --> 00:16:26,200
What danger? - There's a snake at the next turning.

166
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,483
Snake! Oh my God ! What will happen now?

167
00:16:28,807 --> 00:16:33,801
Don't worry, we'll drive it away.

168
00:16:34,206 --> 00:16:38,961
The snake is 18 feet 1 1 inches long.

169
00:16:39,486 --> 00:16:42,284
It's hissing as loud as thundering clouds.

170
00:16:42,647 --> 00:16:46,560
That's a routine occurrence. You just take care of the ladies here. . .

171
00:16:46,966 --> 00:16:49,037
we'll clear the road and be back. - All right.

172
00:16:49,366 --> 00:16:51,834
Come, let's see how big the snake is.

173
00:16:54,486 --> 00:16:58,161
They really are brave men. Honestly aunt. . .

174
00:16:58,486 --> 00:17:02,480
I've never seen or heard of such a huge snake.

175
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:08,317
What are you thinking? - Oh yes!

176
00:17:13,287 --> 00:17:16,961
I just remembered that this is a very dangerous place.

177
00:17:17,446 --> 00:17:22,201
At least one incident does occur here every month.

178
00:17:22,527 --> 00:17:24,915
Incident? What kind of incident?

179
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:29,206
I haven't seen for myself but have heard that. . .

180
00:17:29,567 --> 00:17:34,083
a very dangerous ghost lives here.

181
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:36,842
Ghost? ! - Yes.

182
00:17:37,287 --> 00:17:40,120
Remember Maulana Khuda Bhakt, who committed suicide?

183
00:17:40,487 --> 00:17:42,955
Yes, yes! - He has turned into a ghost.

184
00:17:43,366 --> 00:17:47,279
But I don't believe it. How can he turn into a ghost?

185
00:17:47,807 --> 00:17:50,878
No, it's quiet possible Maulana has turned into a ghost. . .

186
00:17:51,247 --> 00:17:54,125
because he died an untimely death. - No, I don't believe it.

187
00:17:54,487 --> 00:17:58,719
But only day before yesterday, Nabban Khan's son was passing this way

188
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:01,755
He saw Maulana and fell down.

189
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,122
He died on the spot. - Good God !

190
00:18:04,487 --> 00:18:09,880
He was only a kid, but the ghost has killed. . .

191
00:18:10,287 --> 00:18:14,962
even a tough man like Kalandar Ali.

192
00:18:15,366 --> 00:18:18,802
What should we do now? - Don't worry.

193
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:23,484
I think it is all a rumour, there are no ghosts.

194
00:18:39,567 --> 00:18:41,682
The old lady has dropped unconscious.

195
00:18:42,126 --> 00:18:44,960
Aunt! - What happened?

196
00:18:45,487 --> 00:18:46,840
You?

197
00:18:47,287 --> 00:18:49,925
Yes. Where is the ghost? - It was here just now.

198
00:18:50,326 --> 00:18:55,082
It must be around. - Let's get out of here.

199
00:18:58,287 --> 00:19:01,483
Give me the ghost's cloak. If the old woman recovers. . .

200
00:19:01,886 --> 00:19:04,878
I'll scare her and make her unconscious again.

201
00:19:05,487 --> 00:19:10,845
There mustn't be a cheat like you in all of Lucknow.

202
00:19:11,247 --> 00:19:14,125
And there mustn't be a beauty like you in the whole universe.

203
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:17,957
You should feel ashamed of yourself, this was a very cheap act.

204
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:24,875
Danger bells are ringing, the old woman is recovering.

205
00:19:25,487 --> 00:19:29,082
Push a cloth into her mouth and blindfold her.

206
00:19:29,446 --> 00:19:32,006
The poor woman will die. How can you do this?

207
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:37,118
Let's go Aachchan, no one cares for us here.

208
00:19:37,487 --> 00:19:40,479
I'm fed up of this one-sided love. - Why call it one-sided?

209
00:19:40,807 --> 00:19:45,118
Of course. I had to get up to tricks for this small meeting.

210
00:19:45,487 --> 00:19:48,285
I put my life at stake, let myself be called a cheat and a fraud.

211
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:53,117
And you don't care one bit, you only care about your aunt.

212
00:19:53,487 --> 00:19:56,877
You've shattered all my hopes.

213
00:19:57,287 --> 00:20:00,882
You're breaking the heart of the one who truly loves you.

214
00:20:01,287 --> 00:20:04,403
My dear, it's difficult to come across true admirers.

215
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,755
Yes, very difficult.

216
00:20:08,366 --> 00:20:11,483
You mean you don't believe I love you?

217
00:20:11,967 --> 00:20:14,117
That means I'm unnecessarily bent on ruining myself for you.

218
00:20:14,686 --> 00:20:18,759
Who can make the moth understand who the flame burns for?

219
00:20:19,606 --> 00:20:24,600
Whether the moth comes or not, the flame keeps burning, once lit.

220
00:20:25,487 --> 00:20:30,480
Its burning is not for a moment but lifelong.

221
00:20:31,967 --> 00:20:34,401
Who can understand the pain of the silent flame?

222
00:20:35,207 --> 00:20:40,600
I have understood. You revealed your love in those words.

223
00:20:43,086 --> 00:20:46,965
Moth and flame, caution ! The sleeping ones are rising !

224
00:20:49,567 --> 00:20:52,035
Even those who had left are returning.

225
00:20:52,487 --> 00:20:53,476
I'm leaving.

226
00:20:53,727 --> 00:20:55,877
Promise you'll meet me here again tomorrow.

227
00:20:56,287 --> 00:20:58,198
Leave me. - Promise me.

228
00:20:58,567 --> 00:21:00,875
All right, I promise. - Give me that garland. . .

229
00:21:01,287 --> 00:21:03,084
it will be the proof of your promise.

230
00:21:13,487 --> 00:21:16,206
Aunt, where are you?

231
00:21:19,247 --> 00:21:21,681
Where am I? Ghost!

232
00:21:22,487 --> 00:21:28,960
Which ghost, aunt? I chanted a mantra and the ghost disappeared.

233
00:21:29,406 --> 00:21:33,480
And that snake? - There wasn't even a mosquito there.

234
00:21:34,247 --> 00:21:36,283
We checked right upto the city square.

235
00:21:36,646 --> 00:21:40,275
Oh ! Then even the snake must have been the ghost of Maulana.

236
00:21:42,487 --> 00:21:45,081
There is no danger now, let's go.

237
00:21:45,446 --> 00:21:49,485
God saved us today. We'll never come this way even during day time now.

238
00:21:50,287 --> 00:21:52,278
Goodbye! - Bless you.

239
00:22:15,646 --> 00:22:19,958
What can I say about these fragrant, colourful flowers.

240
00:22:21,326 --> 00:22:25,957
Your hands lend them fragrance, your cheeks lend them colour.

241
00:22:26,487 --> 00:22:30,526
Wonderful ! Yusuf, repeat those lines again.

242
00:22:30,967 --> 00:22:32,639
They were wonderful !

243
00:22:32,967 --> 00:22:34,878
Uncle, how come you're here so early in the morning?

244
00:22:35,207 --> 00:22:37,357
Your house smelled so good.

245
00:22:37,767 --> 00:22:42,602
I came in to check which flowers you'd bought home.

246
00:22:44,247 --> 00:22:47,875
Oh yes, flowers. Aachchan had bought them last night.

247
00:22:48,287 --> 00:22:49,879
He forgot to take them back.

248
00:22:51,487 --> 00:22:55,162
I think Aachchan's proximity is proving fateful.

249
00:22:56,406 --> 00:23:03,085
I don't want you to get into something and dash all my plans.

250
00:23:03,686 --> 00:23:07,679
Your plans? - I want to marry you off. . .

251
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:10,964
to such a girl, who brings in dowry worth millions.

252
00:23:11,967 --> 00:23:14,686
God has blessed us with everything.

253
00:23:15,207 --> 00:23:18,836
May he be in heaven, but father has left us so much. . .

254
00:23:19,247 --> 00:23:22,205
that even if we spend it lavishly all our lives, it still won't be over.

255
00:23:22,527 --> 00:23:27,646
The tree of wealth is nourished with silver water.

256
00:23:28,567 --> 00:23:33,277
If you want it to be evergreen, heed my advise. I'm not your enemy.

257
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:37,159
Don't worry, I'll do as you please.

258
00:23:37,567 --> 00:23:43,163
So what if I'm not married? I've seen many a marriage. Remember.

259
00:23:49,287 --> 00:23:53,326
God willing, you'll see another marriage soon enough.

260
00:24:09,007 --> 00:24:12,158
Poor girl, you'd come to meet him with such high hopes.

261
00:24:12,487 --> 00:24:15,160
But Yusuf isn't here.

262
00:24:15,727 --> 00:24:20,118
I'm sure he'll come. - Oh sure he will !

263
00:24:20,527 --> 00:24:24,155
I think, the way he fooled you last night by becoming a ghost. . .

264
00:24:24,487 --> 00:24:26,875
he's fooled you again by calling you here today. Let's go. . .

265
00:24:27,287 --> 00:24:29,481
No point waiting for him now. - No, Bilkis.

266
00:24:34,166 --> 00:24:35,679
I'll wait for him.

267
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:37,882
Until when?

268
00:24:40,207 --> 00:24:41,480
Till eternity.

269
00:24:47,967 --> 00:24:51,960
''I shall wait for you. . . ''

270
00:24:52,487 --> 00:24:56,480
''I shall wait for you. . . ''

271
00:24:56,686 --> 00:24:59,962
''till the end of Time''

272
00:25:00,967 --> 00:25:04,482
''May God bring about such a day. . . ''

273
00:25:05,126 --> 00:25:08,243
''that heralds your arrival''

274
00:25:16,487 --> 00:25:20,480
''I shall wait for you''

275
00:25:27,287 --> 00:25:33,965
''Waiting for the beloved is a test of patience''

276
00:25:35,287 --> 00:25:41,965
''It's when the flames of passion are roused''

277
00:25:43,487 --> 00:25:47,480
''May this wait linger on. . . ''

278
00:25:53,487 --> 00:25:56,479
''and herald your arrival''

279
00:25:57,487 --> 00:26:03,960
''May God bring about your arrival''

280
00:26:19,487 --> 00:26:26,484
''How I have waited for the unfaithful one''

281
00:26:27,487 --> 00:26:34,484
''How I yearn to see him''

282
00:26:35,487 --> 00:26:39,958
''May my prayer be accepted. . . ''

283
00:26:45,967 --> 00:26:48,959
''and bring you here''

284
00:27:10,487 --> 00:27:17,484
''Fortunate is the one you desire''

285
00:27:26,487 --> 00:27:33,120
''May God bless our love with success''

286
00:27:39,967 --> 00:27:43,960
''May luck smile upon me. . . ''

287
00:27:44,807 --> 00:27:47,878
''and bring you here''

288
00:27:48,646 --> 00:27:52,480
''May God bring Time to an end. . . ''

289
00:27:52,727 --> 00:27:55,958
''and herald your arrival''

290
00:27:56,287 --> 00:27:59,961
''I shall wait for you''

291
00:28:01,686 --> 00:28:03,961
Greetings to you !

292
00:28:04,606 --> 00:28:07,723
Wonderful ! If someone had sang such a lovely song for me. . .

293
00:28:08,126 --> 00:28:10,117
I would lay my heart at his feet.

294
00:28:10,487 --> 00:28:13,479
Give him a penny, he'll be pleased.

295
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,443
Who is this lady?

296
00:28:17,207 --> 00:28:20,483
My friend, Bilkis. - She seems quiet sharp.

297
00:28:21,287 --> 00:28:23,084
That's why I brought her along.

298
00:28:30,686 --> 00:28:34,235
Why did you bring her along? Don't you trust me?

299
00:28:35,326 --> 00:28:37,635
I do and don't either.

300
00:28:38,487 --> 00:28:41,365
I wish you'd know how deeply I love you.

301
00:28:41,767 --> 00:28:45,237
Honestly, I don't only love you,. . .

302
00:28:46,287 --> 00:28:48,403
but consider you God and adore you.

303
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:53,482
Please don't compare me to God and make a sinner of me.

304
00:28:54,487 --> 00:28:57,365
Where is this Romeo Juliet play going on?

305
00:28:57,727 --> 00:29:01,197
Oh, this Bilkis is too much.

306
00:29:01,646 --> 00:29:03,762
Let's keep a distance from her.

307
00:29:15,207 --> 00:29:18,882
I don't like our meeting secretively or under someone's chaperonage.

308
00:29:19,646 --> 00:29:22,798
Find some way by which we become one in the eyes of God. . .

309
00:29:23,207 --> 00:29:25,675
in the eyes of society.

310
00:29:26,686 --> 00:29:29,962
That's your duty, not mine.

311
00:29:30,487 --> 00:29:33,843
Send your proposal to father, maybe he accepts.

312
00:29:36,326 --> 00:29:41,241
But remember, I've surrendered myself to you.

313
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:46,479
I swear, if I can't marry you, I won't marry anyone else.

314
00:29:47,287 --> 00:29:49,481
Even I promise to live and die with you.

315
00:29:50,487 --> 00:29:54,446
If I don't get you, I'll swallow this diamond and kill myself.

316
00:29:54,846 --> 00:29:56,916
Oh my God ! Show me your diamond.

317
00:30:05,767 --> 00:30:08,963
What have you done? You threw away such an expensive ring?

318
00:30:10,487 --> 00:30:12,478
It wasn't more expensive than your life.

319
00:30:15,207 --> 00:30:17,277
It's late, let's go home.

320
00:30:18,287 --> 00:30:22,837
Shall I leave? - Tell me, when will we meet again?

321
00:30:23,686 --> 00:30:28,760
I'll go every Friday to offer flowers at the shrine of Shah Baba.

322
00:30:29,366 --> 00:30:31,755
I'll also be present there every Friday.

323
00:30:32,686 --> 00:30:37,476
We'll pray together that he grants us our wish.

324
00:30:39,487 --> 00:30:42,047
Every Friday, at the shrine. . .

325
00:30:43,366 --> 00:30:46,483
we'll meet by twilight.

326
00:30:48,287 --> 00:30:51,677
Promise? - Promise.

327
00:31:04,406 --> 00:31:06,966
Naseeban, call Suraiya. - Brother!

328
00:31:08,727 --> 00:31:10,922
Where were you? - Playing hide and seek. . .

329
00:31:11,326 --> 00:31:14,682
on the terrace with my friends. - Stop playing now, grow up.

330
00:31:15,086 --> 00:31:19,079
Learn to take care of the house. - Sorry, I can't do that.

331
00:31:19,487 --> 00:31:20,885
Then who will?

332
00:31:21,166 --> 00:31:23,555
The one without whom this house seems dull.

333
00:31:24,527 --> 00:31:29,123
When mother died in my childhood, I thought you'd get married. . .

334
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:31,682
and I'd get another mother in the form of a sister-in-law.

335
00:31:32,326 --> 00:31:34,965
But it seems like you've taken an oath never to marry.

336
00:31:35,446 --> 00:31:39,758
God knows if this wish will ever be fulfilled.

337
00:31:40,487 --> 00:31:43,125
I can bring you an army of sisters-in-law.

338
00:31:43,446 --> 00:31:47,325
But I fear, what if you don't like her.

339
00:31:47,686 --> 00:31:51,076
Brother, try me. I promise I'll accept even an ugly sister-in-law.

340
00:31:53,126 --> 00:31:55,117
All right. But I had planned. . .

341
00:31:55,487 --> 00:31:59,082
to get you married first before getting married myself.

342
00:31:59,487 --> 00:32:02,683
At least now you've agreed to get married.

343
00:32:03,487 --> 00:32:07,765
All right, now give me my earrings. - That's what I had called you for.

344
00:32:08,287 --> 00:32:12,040
I was busy all day, I forgot about your earrings.

345
00:32:13,207 --> 00:32:15,323
I'll definitely get them tomorrow.

346
00:32:15,686 --> 00:32:17,483
Promise me! - I promise.

347
00:32:19,487 --> 00:32:20,476
All right.

348
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:25,115
You look so beautiful, someone is really going to go crazy today.

349
00:32:25,487 --> 00:32:27,125
Where are you taking her?

350
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:31,958
I had to buy jewellery, so I thought I'd take Zeenat along.

351
00:32:32,366 --> 00:32:36,245
She can help me choose better. - All right, even I'll come along.

352
00:32:36,646 --> 00:32:41,003
Bilkis, aunt doesn't trust you. Aunt, you can come along.

353
00:32:41,366 --> 00:32:42,355
Let's go.

354
00:32:54,207 --> 00:32:55,925
Sir, here's the shop.

355
00:33:01,727 --> 00:33:05,276
Enough ! - Buy some studded jewellery.

356
00:33:05,686 --> 00:33:08,723
I should have money for it. What I've bought is enough.

357
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:12,957
You don't lack in money, you belong to an aristocratic family.

358
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:16,358
That's no more true.

359
00:33:17,326 --> 00:33:21,286
Wonderful ! Beautiful bangles. What's their price?

360
00:33:21,686 --> 00:33:25,122
Not much, only Rs.4000. - 4000?

361
00:33:25,487 --> 00:33:27,317
Yes. - Oh God !

362
00:33:50,767 --> 00:33:54,202
We're leaving. Send the jewellery home, I'll pay on delivery.

363
00:33:54,567 --> 00:33:55,885
As you wish.

364
00:34:24,206 --> 00:34:26,766
Did you like anything? - I've liked it very much.

365
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:29,920
Follow those women and check where they are going.

366
00:34:30,327 --> 00:34:33,000
What did you say? - Find out where. . .

367
00:34:33,407 --> 00:34:36,876
that lady in the black veil lives. - Congratulations!

368
00:34:37,286 --> 00:34:40,119
Hurry, or they will disappear. - Don't worry. . .

369
00:34:40,487 --> 00:34:44,684
I'll find out about her whole family. - Go on !

370
00:34:53,447 --> 00:34:56,564
Sir, you? - I just send Mirza on some assignment

371
00:34:57,567 --> 00:35:01,115
Show me the bangles that lady saw just now.

372
00:35:01,487 --> 00:35:03,204
Here they are. - These?

373
00:35:04,726 --> 00:35:08,560
They really are pretty. I'll buy them.

374
00:35:33,527 --> 00:35:36,166
Forgive me, lady.

375
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:40,161
Are you blind?

376
00:35:40,527 --> 00:35:42,882
I think he's a loafer. - What happened, lady?

377
00:35:43,206 --> 00:35:47,165
The way he pounced on her like a mountain goat. . .

378
00:35:47,487 --> 00:35:51,958
the poor girl has fallen flat on the ground.

379
00:35:52,367 --> 00:35:57,805
How dare you? - Look at me, do I look like a loafer?

380
00:36:04,487 --> 00:36:06,478
You can fabricate good stories.

381
00:36:17,367 --> 00:36:18,356
Stop!

382
00:36:20,327 --> 00:36:23,637
Hey, you ! What's going on?

383
00:36:24,206 --> 00:36:27,324
A loafer was teasing women in the streets.

384
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:33,280
How dare he! Even I will use my hands on him.

385
00:36:35,686 --> 00:36:37,483
Move aside.

386
00:36:40,487 --> 00:36:42,478
This proved too expensive. - Mirza, you?

387
00:36:43,286 --> 00:36:47,643
Aachchan, save me from these people. They have crushed my bones to pulp.

388
00:36:48,047 --> 00:36:51,880
What have you'll done? He's a poet and a very decent man.

389
00:36:52,286 --> 00:36:55,164
So decent, that he doesn't even tease his own wife.

390
00:36:55,487 --> 00:36:59,320
How could he have teased other women? Please go.

391
00:37:01,487 --> 00:37:02,476
Come, Mirza.

392
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:08,321
All right, you sit here, I'll get the medicine for you.

393
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:12,116
But please stay within limits of decency.

394
00:37:12,487 --> 00:37:14,954
This is Nawab Mirza Sultan Mia.

395
00:37:15,367 --> 00:37:21,044
Hello! Forgive me, but we are meeting in strange circumstances.

396
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:23,756
God knows what you must be thinking of me.

397
00:37:31,927 --> 00:37:33,883
Kariman? - Yes, sir.

398
00:37:34,286 --> 00:37:36,117
Where had you been?

399
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:40,764
Oh, what do I tell you? I really felt envious today.

400
00:37:41,286 --> 00:37:45,326
Why? - Bilkis had gone to the jewellers.

401
00:37:46,206 --> 00:37:50,085
Zeenat also went along with her. Such lovely studded jewellery there!

402
00:37:50,487 --> 00:37:52,954
Bilkis purchased jewellery worth Rs.4000 - 5000.

403
00:37:53,327 --> 00:37:56,637
But our poor Zeenat had to curb her desires.

404
00:37:57,047 --> 00:37:59,038
She couldn't even buy a ring for herself.

405
00:37:59,367 --> 00:38:04,122
Who are you talking about? Zeenat doesn't need any jewellery.

406
00:38:04,487 --> 00:38:06,159
She has bags full of it.

407
00:38:06,487 --> 00:38:09,684
Is she some poor girl that she'll crave for jewellery?

408
00:38:10,166 --> 00:38:12,601
Are you in your senses? Go away!

409
00:38:14,686 --> 00:38:16,483
I'll be leaving.

410
00:38:24,487 --> 00:38:26,796
What are you doing? - Mixing turmeric in milk.

411
00:38:27,206 --> 00:38:32,963
Has the cock hurt himself? - No. Mirza Bulbul was beaten up.

412
00:38:33,367 --> 00:38:35,323
He is badly hurt. - But he has left.

413
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:36,961
He's gone? - Yes.

414
00:38:37,487 --> 00:38:41,559
That's good. You drink this milk with turmeric in it.

415
00:38:41,967 --> 00:38:45,277
Even you are badly injured. Have it.

416
00:38:45,646 --> 00:38:47,842
Why are you adding fuel to fire?

417
00:38:48,206 --> 00:38:51,118
I had come to have one look at her and console myself.

418
00:38:51,487 --> 00:38:53,478
But the old man is sitting right outside.

419
00:38:54,246 --> 00:38:58,524
I can't see any way I can see her today. Please do something.

420
00:38:58,927 --> 00:39:01,963
You'll have me thrown out! As it is, I have to pay rent. . .

421
00:39:02,327 --> 00:39:04,716
of six months yet, and then you behave like this.

422
00:39:05,126 --> 00:39:11,201
Friend, if I could, I would pay your rent for six years.

423
00:39:11,606 --> 00:39:15,599
But I'm helpless because of my uncle. He never lets me spend a penny.

424
00:39:16,007 --> 00:39:17,804
Why?

425
00:39:18,367 --> 00:39:22,042
My late father has made him my guardian.

426
00:39:22,447 --> 00:39:24,914
As per his will, until I get married. . .

427
00:39:25,286 --> 00:39:27,322
the entire property will belong to uncle.

428
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:33,276
His name is Mir Kurban Ali. He has conned quiet a lot of people.

429
00:39:33,646 --> 00:39:37,322
It may so happen, that even before you get married. . .

430
00:39:37,686 --> 00:39:42,157
he squander away all your wealth. So heed my advise.

431
00:39:42,487 --> 00:39:47,117
Marry any girl you can get.

432
00:39:47,487 --> 00:39:50,398
Why any girl, I have her.

433
00:39:51,206 --> 00:39:54,324
Aachchan, tell uncle to speak to Mr Sultan.

434
00:39:54,686 --> 00:39:58,156
If he agrees, I'll be overjoyed.

435
00:39:58,967 --> 00:40:01,117
Back to square one?

436
00:40:01,567 --> 00:40:06,686
Damn this love sickness. The more you cure it, the more it aggravates.

437
00:40:07,327 --> 00:40:10,683
I'll speak to him. - Bless you, friend !

438
00:40:13,567 --> 00:40:18,277
''Ask my heart. Her eyes have pierced arrows in it''

439
00:40:19,487 --> 00:40:23,115
''This pain wouldn't have been Had they pierced right through''

440
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:26,956
Greetings, sir. - You're back, Mirza?

441
00:40:28,487 --> 00:40:32,719
Oh yes, with God's grace, I'm back safe and sound.

442
00:40:34,206 --> 00:40:39,884
Did you find out? - How would I not? I'm a born spy.

443
00:40:40,286 --> 00:40:43,881
My late grandfather. . . - Forget them, what did you find out?

444
00:40:44,286 --> 00:40:48,996
I ran here, there, was abused and beaten.

445
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:52,041
But I finally tracked down the lady. - Really?

446
00:40:52,447 --> 00:40:55,119
Yes. - Tell me who she is, where she lives.

447
00:40:55,487 --> 00:41:00,083
Have you heard of Nawab Sultan living in that old mansion?

448
00:41:00,567 --> 00:41:06,802
She is his daughter. Her name is Zeenat Jahan Begum.

449
00:41:07,286 --> 00:41:09,754
Great, Mirza. You found out her name too.

450
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:12,961
I'm impressed by your spying ability.

451
00:41:13,447 --> 00:41:15,438
But see that you don't tell this to anyone yet.

452
00:41:15,686 --> 00:41:19,964
Of course not, trust me.

453
00:41:20,367 --> 00:41:23,598
Not a soul will know about it.

454
00:41:24,447 --> 00:41:26,881
After you. - No, today you must have it first.

455
00:41:27,286 --> 00:41:29,481
No, you. - No, you first.

456
00:41:32,286 --> 00:41:35,995
Oh God, thank you so much. You have granted my wish.

457
00:41:36,487 --> 00:41:38,478
You have heard my prayers.

458
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:46,358
Mr Mir. . . - What is it Mr Mirza?

459
00:41:54,487 --> 00:41:57,479
What happened, Mirza? - Please save me.

460
00:41:58,286 --> 00:42:01,676
I have a severe pain in my stomach.

461
00:42:03,726 --> 00:42:09,643
If it's indigestion, I have medicines. - Medication can't cure my indigestion

462
00:42:12,407 --> 00:42:15,479
There is something which is jumping inside my stomach.

463
00:42:16,206 --> 00:42:19,118
It wants to come out.

464
00:42:19,487 --> 00:42:24,277
What thing is it? - I won't tell you that.

465
00:42:24,686 --> 00:42:29,885
I'll never tell you that. - Then come and lie down on the bed.

466
00:42:32,246 --> 00:42:34,760
Come, sit down.

467
00:42:37,086 --> 00:42:41,159
Tell me now. - No, even if I lose my life. . .

468
00:42:41,487 --> 00:42:46,845
I'll never break the promise I gave the Nawab.

469
00:42:47,286 --> 00:42:51,962
What promise have you given the Nawab? - What do I say?

470
00:42:56,487 --> 00:42:59,479
Now it's beyond my control.

471
00:43:00,806 --> 00:43:06,199
Speak it out, I can't bear to see you in pain.

472
00:43:09,686 --> 00:43:14,556
Yes? - The Nawab has. . .

473
00:43:15,047 --> 00:43:20,201
What has the Nawab done? - He has chosen a girl for himself.

474
00:43:21,327 --> 00:43:23,045
What did you say?

475
00:43:24,487 --> 00:43:26,842
What a relief!

476
00:43:28,286 --> 00:43:31,244
It is easier to digest an elephant. . .

477
00:43:31,646 --> 00:43:35,161
but very difficult to keep a secret.

478
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:41,722
But I put you on oath, don't tell this to anyone.

479
00:43:42,166 --> 00:43:43,281
Never!

480
00:43:50,447 --> 00:43:52,164
Have you heard this? - What?

481
00:43:52,487 --> 00:43:56,320
It's good news. The Nawab has selected a bride.

482
00:43:56,686 --> 00:44:00,123
Really? - But please don't tell anyone.

483
00:44:00,487 --> 00:44:01,840
Never!

484
00:44:06,726 --> 00:44:08,603
Why are you all quiet?

485
00:44:09,487 --> 00:44:11,478
What is the matter, Mirza?

486
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:18,077
What is all the secrecy about? Say something.

487
00:44:19,367 --> 00:44:22,836
Sir. . . - What sir? Say something.

488
00:44:23,286 --> 00:44:25,721
How do I say? - With your mouth of course.

489
00:44:26,327 --> 00:44:29,478
Sir, congratulations! - Congratulations!

490
00:44:34,206 --> 00:44:40,281
I understand. Mirza, why did you do this?

491
00:44:40,806 --> 00:44:43,240
I'm sorry. - But I had told you. . .

492
00:44:43,606 --> 00:44:49,125
I tried a lot not to reveal it.

493
00:44:49,487 --> 00:44:55,925
But I felt so restless not telling it, that I had to spit it out.

494
00:44:57,726 --> 00:45:02,481
It's not a matter to hide. By God's grace, we've finally seen this day.

495
00:45:03,327 --> 00:45:08,276
Sir, send your proposal soon, so that we finally see you married.

496
00:45:09,327 --> 00:45:10,316
You're right.

497
00:45:10,686 --> 00:45:14,964
Mirza, now even I feel this house needs a mistress. . .

498
00:45:15,367 --> 00:45:19,201
and Suraiya needs a sister-in-law. - No doubt about it.

499
00:45:19,646 --> 00:45:24,880
You carry my proposal to Nawab Sultan today itself.

500
00:45:25,367 --> 00:45:29,485
Why today, I'll go right now. Come, Mirza.

501
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:34,558
This auspicious day has finally dawned.

502
00:45:36,047 --> 00:45:40,119
Who is she? Which family does she belong to?

503
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:44,162
The girl's name is Zeenat, she's the daughter of Nawab Sultan.

504
00:45:44,527 --> 00:45:48,759
So, what do you say? - She's a very nice girl.

505
00:45:49,166 --> 00:45:51,396
Yusuf has selected a highly respectable family.

506
00:45:51,726 --> 00:45:53,956
I'm free of a major worry now.

507
00:45:54,327 --> 00:45:59,276
I'll soon get him married and hand over all his property to him. . .

508
00:45:59,686 --> 00:46:03,076
and myself go to Mecca and Madina for Haj.

509
00:46:03,487 --> 00:46:06,159
That's a good idea, do go for your pilgrimage.

510
00:46:06,487 --> 00:46:10,320
And if you like it, settle down there itself.

511
00:46:10,686 --> 00:46:13,076
Not just your's, but the whole of Lucknow's sins will be washed.

512
00:46:13,447 --> 00:46:15,164
What? - I mean. . .

513
00:46:15,487 --> 00:46:18,479
you'll do a good deed by going there. - True.

514
00:46:19,487 --> 00:46:22,320
So will you send a proposal to Mr Sultan?

515
00:46:22,686 --> 00:46:26,918
Of course I will, and I'm sure the Sultan will not reject the proposal.

516
00:46:27,286 --> 00:46:30,483
God bless you ! I'll give this news to Yusuf.

517
00:46:31,327 --> 00:46:32,806
Goodbye! - Goodbye.

518
00:46:38,246 --> 00:46:43,195
You want me to axe my own foot?

519
00:46:44,047 --> 00:46:46,242
Once he gets married, I'll lose the property.

520
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:49,166
If I lose the property, I won't be able to indulge myself.

521
00:46:49,487 --> 00:46:53,684
Do you think I'm so stupid? I'll see how this marriage takes place.

522
00:46:55,967 --> 00:46:58,037
I accept gratefully.

523
00:46:59,407 --> 00:47:05,481
I'd never dreamt I'd get such a good proposal for my daughter.

524
00:47:06,487 --> 00:47:10,001
Tell Nawab Sikandar Mirza to make arrangements for the marriage.

525
00:47:10,367 --> 00:47:12,119
Congratulations!

526
00:47:12,487 --> 00:47:17,083
Today is Friday. If you agree, we can fix the wedding for next Friday.

527
00:47:17,487 --> 00:47:23,164
Just remember that I am everything to my daughter.

528
00:47:24,487 --> 00:47:28,195
So, it would be better if no women attend the wedding.

529
00:47:29,487 --> 00:47:31,603
There is no lady to welcome them here.

530
00:47:32,007 --> 00:47:35,282
Don't worry. - Goodbye.

531
00:49:10,487 --> 00:49:15,481
''This evening is dedicated to your eyes''

532
00:49:17,487 --> 00:49:23,960
''Loyalty, your eyes reflect''

533
00:49:24,967 --> 00:49:33,965
''The fun that lies in speaking to you through my eyes. . . ''

534
00:49:46,286 --> 00:49:51,963
''Oh, how well versed I am in singing the song of love''

535
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:08,961
''I shall tell you how I feel at heart. . . ''

536
00:50:09,967 --> 00:50:12,959
''in the language of my eyes''

537
00:50:24,967 --> 00:50:30,485
''By all means, you may put my loyalty to test''

538
00:50:42,726 --> 00:50:47,960
''In love with you. . . ''

539
00:50:48,766 --> 00:50:51,963
''I shall stand every test of time''

540
00:51:02,967 --> 00:51:08,485
''O pretty one, may God preserve your beauty''

541
00:51:31,487 --> 00:51:36,959
''I no longer care what happens on earth or the heavens''

542
00:52:10,086 --> 00:52:15,956
''Oh, how well versed I am in singing the song of love''

543
00:52:28,686 --> 00:52:31,759
Is everything okay?

544
00:52:32,447 --> 00:52:37,885
I have only my mansion which I have come to mortgage.

545
00:52:39,246 --> 00:52:44,844
Zeenat's marriage has been fixed. - Already? With whom?

546
00:52:45,367 --> 00:52:48,961
With Nawab Sikander Mirza. - With Nawab Sikander Mirza, I see.

547
00:52:49,567 --> 00:52:54,117
That's nice. Your daughter is indeed very lucky.

548
00:52:54,487 --> 00:52:56,239
Only the fortunate ones get such proposals.

549
00:52:56,487 --> 00:52:58,954
My advise is that you don't waste time and perform the marriage quickly.

550
00:52:59,367 --> 00:53:01,323
It is fixed for this Friday.

551
00:53:01,686 --> 00:53:04,886
The proposal was so good, I thought it was advisable. . .

552
00:53:04,887 --> 00:53:07,196
to have the marriage soon. - Of course.

553
00:53:12,327 --> 00:53:13,919
Yusuf. . . - Yes, uncle?

554
00:53:14,327 --> 00:53:18,286
You are indeed lucky. I just spoke about your proposal to Mr Sultan. . .

555
00:53:19,686 --> 00:53:22,154
and here I earned a profit of Rs 10,000.

556
00:53:22,487 --> 00:53:25,718
What did you say? Uncle!

557
00:53:27,327 --> 00:53:29,318
Did you really convey my proposal to the Nawab?

558
00:53:30,246 --> 00:53:32,202
What did he say? Did he agree or not?

559
00:53:32,487 --> 00:53:35,876
He will agree, no one dares to go against my wishes.

560
00:53:36,286 --> 00:53:39,518
And that Rs 10,000? - It's all one's fate.

561
00:53:40,086 --> 00:53:41,884
Allahabad's Nawab Aga Ali Khan. . .

562
00:53:42,286 --> 00:53:45,278
wants to settle his financial matters through me.

563
00:53:45,646 --> 00:53:48,114
He'll pay me Rs 10,000 as commission for it.

564
00:53:48,487 --> 00:53:51,126
You go to Allahabad, collect the money for me and return in a week's time

565
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:54,684
You want me to go to Allahabad? Damn the Rs 10,000 !

566
00:53:55,047 --> 00:53:58,356
I'm the sole heir to this massive property. 10,000 is peanuts!

567
00:53:58,766 --> 00:54:01,155
My dear, you are the heir to this property.

568
00:54:01,487 --> 00:54:04,684
But what will your uncle gift you in marriage?

569
00:54:05,206 --> 00:54:08,801
Do you want me to be humiliated? Even I am a respectable man after all.

570
00:54:09,206 --> 00:54:14,121
Leave at once. Meanwhile, I'll fix the wedding date with Nawab Sultan.

571
00:54:14,487 --> 00:54:19,481
Uncle, you are so good. - You'll know how good, only later.

572
00:54:20,327 --> 00:54:24,639
Now prepare to leave. The moment you are back, I'll have you married.

573
00:54:25,286 --> 00:54:28,676
Are you happy now? - Of course.

574
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:32,323
Uncle, bravo!

575
00:54:34,447 --> 00:54:39,237
Thank God that the alliance has come for her without our trying.

576
00:54:39,686 --> 00:54:44,123
Our daughter is lucky, to get such a good proposal.

577
00:54:44,487 --> 00:54:47,284
I was overjoyed the moment I heard the boy's name.

578
00:54:47,726 --> 00:54:53,119
God has blessed him with health, wealth, everything.

579
00:54:54,086 --> 00:54:55,076
Thank God.

580
00:54:59,487 --> 00:55:02,479
Aachchan, let me kiss you.

581
00:55:03,686 --> 00:55:06,837
Since when did you develop this hobby?

582
00:55:07,246 --> 00:55:12,878
My marriage is being discussed about everywhere. I must thank you for it.

583
00:55:13,286 --> 00:55:15,959
You convinced uncle and uncle convinced Mr Sultan.

584
00:55:16,367 --> 00:55:21,077
I have the Midas touch, everything I touch turns gold.

585
00:55:21,487 --> 00:55:25,958
If Romeo was around, I would get him married to Juliet. . .

586
00:55:26,327 --> 00:55:31,765
then even if I myself had to marry Juliet's mother for it.

587
00:55:33,367 --> 00:55:35,483
When will she enter my house as a bride?

588
00:55:35,887 --> 00:55:37,878
When will I raise the veil from her face?

589
00:55:38,286 --> 00:55:39,924
I'm so desperate.

590
00:55:40,327 --> 00:55:43,125
In such a situation, uncle has issued strange orders.

591
00:55:43,487 --> 00:55:46,047
What orders? - He's asked me to go to Allahabad.

592
00:55:46,367 --> 00:55:50,121
He's going to earn Rs 10,000 from a deal there. I told him to forget it.

593
00:55:50,487 --> 00:55:53,081
He said he'd like to spend the money on my marriage on his behalf.

594
00:55:53,447 --> 00:55:55,278
Tell me what I should do, go or not?

595
00:55:55,646 --> 00:56:01,278
I would advise you to go. You'll be able to control your emotions then.

596
00:56:01,766 --> 00:56:05,123
Your uncle turned out to be a good man.

597
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:08,479
I never thought very highly of him.

598
00:56:09,487 --> 00:56:12,284
When are you going to Allahabad? - Today, if you say so.

599
00:56:12,686 --> 00:56:17,123
But if you get a chance, tell her I'll return soon, not to worry.

600
00:56:17,487 --> 00:56:21,878
Why will she worry now? Even she must be overjoyed.

601
00:56:36,447 --> 00:56:39,836
Aunt Kariman. . . . - Yes, child?

602
00:56:40,927 --> 00:56:44,317
What is all this? - Don't you know?

603
00:56:44,806 --> 00:56:49,322
Bless you, child.

604
00:56:53,327 --> 00:56:55,887
Greetings, Nawab. Can I come in?

605
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,838
Aachchan, please come.

606
00:57:01,206 --> 00:57:04,882
Zeenat is getting married into such a rich family.

607
00:57:05,367 --> 00:57:10,964
If not much, I'll have to give some dowry as per their status.

608
00:57:11,487 --> 00:57:16,117
The boy and girl are both your own. You are unnecessarily being formal.

609
00:57:16,487 --> 00:57:21,117
I don't have to do it everytime. I have only one daughter.

610
00:57:21,487 --> 00:57:23,478
I want to fulfil all my desires this once.

611
00:57:24,126 --> 00:57:29,519
By God's grace, the boy and his family are both good.

612
00:57:29,927 --> 00:57:34,125
Of course it's God's grace, but even I put in a lot of effort.

613
00:57:34,487 --> 00:57:37,206
You don't know how much I've influenced this marriage.

614
00:57:37,527 --> 00:57:40,996
Thank you. One comes across good people too by God's grace.

615
00:57:42,286 --> 00:57:44,641
The truth is that my daughter is very fortunate.

616
00:57:52,487 --> 00:57:55,126
Why are you so happy? - It is fixed.

617
00:57:55,487 --> 00:57:58,081
What? - Marriage. Look at this.

618
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:01,280
Whose marriage? - My marriage.

619
00:58:01,646 --> 00:58:04,001
With whom? - With him.

620
00:58:04,407 --> 00:58:05,885
Yusuf? - Yes.

621
00:58:06,286 --> 00:58:08,880
Really? - Yes, I swear.

622
00:58:19,967 --> 00:58:21,684
Mirza ! I'll just be back.

623
00:58:25,686 --> 00:58:28,484
So many flowers? Want to lay them at some grave?

624
00:58:28,887 --> 00:58:33,164
Or is it your fourth marriage? - That will happen one day.

625
00:58:33,527 --> 00:58:37,202
But these are flowers for Nawab Sikander's marriage.

626
00:58:37,527 --> 00:58:40,883
Nawab Sikander is getting married? That's surprising.

627
00:58:41,286 --> 00:58:44,278
He has got besotted by a beauty.

628
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:49,163
But the girl is indeed very beautiful.

629
00:58:49,487 --> 00:58:52,081
Who is she?

630
00:58:52,487 --> 00:59:00,166
You know them. She's the daughter of Nawab Sultan.

631
00:59:01,007 --> 00:59:04,840
Nawab Sultan's daughter? Are you crazy?

632
00:59:05,246 --> 00:59:08,556
Her marriage is fixed with. . . You surely are not in your senses.

633
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:11,885
If you don't believe me, come and see for yourself.

634
00:59:12,246 --> 00:59:15,636
The wedding is fixed for today.

635
00:59:16,047 --> 00:59:19,641
Say you are only joking, this is all a lie.

636
00:59:20,206 --> 00:59:22,960
Aachchan, what's wrong with you?

637
00:59:23,367 --> 00:59:28,202
I'm very angry. If this turns out to be true, I'll kill you.

638
00:59:30,487 --> 00:59:32,478
I'll kill at least two three people.

639
00:59:34,967 --> 00:59:36,195
Let's go.

640
00:59:37,527 --> 00:59:39,085
Uncle!

641
00:59:41,246 --> 00:59:43,282
What am I hearing? - What?

642
00:59:43,646 --> 00:59:46,683
That Zeenat is getting married to Nawab Sikander Mirza.

643
00:59:47,086 --> 00:59:50,476
How is that possible?

644
00:59:50,847 --> 00:59:53,202
I have heard it from a very reliable source.

645
00:59:53,527 --> 00:59:56,199
I think some enemy is spreading this rumour.

646
00:59:56,567 --> 01:00:00,115
I feel someone has fooled you. - I hope that's true.

647
01:00:00,487 --> 01:00:04,036
Of course. At least go and confirm.

648
01:00:04,447 --> 01:00:09,202
It is possible Nawab Sultan promised you and then changed his mind

649
01:00:10,166 --> 01:00:14,284
If Sultan does that, he'll be disgraced in the whole of Lucknow.

650
01:00:14,646 --> 01:00:17,240
If he humiliates me, even he will fall in people's esteem.

651
01:00:17,567 --> 01:00:21,115
Go and find out the facts. I swear. . .

652
01:00:21,487 --> 01:00:24,159
if this is true, I'll telegram Yusuf to return immediately.

653
01:00:24,487 --> 01:00:26,796
When two grooms reach the Sultan's house at the same time. . .

654
01:00:27,126 --> 01:00:31,278
he'll realise his mistake. - Yusuf will become a laughing stock!

655
01:00:31,646 --> 01:00:33,842
If you have to do something, do it quick.

656
01:00:34,166 --> 01:00:37,203
I'm going and will somehow stall this marriage. Goodbye!

657
01:00:58,487 --> 01:01:03,197
The groom sends these bangles. He wants the bride to wear them.

658
01:01:05,487 --> 01:01:07,478
God save you from evil eyes.

659
01:01:12,407 --> 01:01:18,277
Such beautiful bangles. - I've seen them somewhere.

660
01:01:20,487 --> 01:01:24,081
Oh yes, they are the bangles you'd liked at the jewellers.

661
01:01:24,646 --> 01:01:30,039
You are a made for each other couple. Your likes are similar.

662
01:01:33,487 --> 01:01:36,240
I don't understand how I should stall this marriage.

663
01:01:38,086 --> 01:01:41,123
I'll go and meet Nawab Sikander Mirza.

664
01:01:41,487 --> 01:01:46,845
I'll narrate the whole story to him. Maybe he feels pity for both of them.

665
01:01:49,367 --> 01:01:51,403
I have left Babban outside Aachchan's house.

666
01:01:51,726 --> 01:01:54,194
He will definitely get out of the house to do something.

667
01:01:54,527 --> 01:02:00,124
If he succeeds in stalling Nawab Sikander Mirza's marriage. . .

668
01:02:00,487 --> 01:02:03,956
then we'll be ruined. So what we have planned must happen.

669
01:02:04,327 --> 01:02:07,876
Just let him get out of the house, then see what I'll do.

670
01:02:08,286 --> 01:02:13,201
You have only seen my grace, not the real me.

671
01:02:14,246 --> 01:02:18,159
Sir, he's coming. - Go pounce on him.

672
01:02:24,527 --> 01:02:28,963
Oh, I'm ruined ! This man is trying to assault me.

673
01:02:29,367 --> 01:02:31,961
Hey lady! - What did you say, am I your lady?

674
01:02:32,367 --> 01:02:35,120
Why bother me, mother? - How dare you call me mother?

675
01:02:35,487 --> 01:02:38,284
you're as old as my father. - Your father? What's your age?

676
01:02:38,686 --> 01:02:40,802
I'll call your father and make him tell you that.

677
01:02:42,766 --> 01:02:45,326
Leave my hand. - What happened?

678
01:02:45,726 --> 01:02:48,365
Arrest him, officer. He was trying to assault me.

679
01:02:48,726 --> 01:02:51,719
She's lying. She herself dashed against me, I didn't even touch her.

680
01:02:52,047 --> 01:02:55,119
As if you are so handsome that I'll dash against you.

681
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:59,115
And do you think you are such a beauty? Bloody cannon !

682
01:02:59,487 --> 01:03:02,047
What did you say? Cannon? Did you hear that, officer?

683
01:03:02,367 --> 01:03:07,282
Where is my necklace? I'm sure he has robbed it, search him.

684
01:03:07,646 --> 01:03:10,161
Sure, you can search me. I haven't robbed anything.

685
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:14,479
Search him well. - Yes, please do.

686
01:03:16,527 --> 01:03:19,883
Yes, that's the one. - Is this also a lie?

687
01:03:20,286 --> 01:03:24,120
I don't know how it came into my pocket. I don't understand this.

688
01:03:24,487 --> 01:03:26,603
You will, once you reach the police station.

689
01:03:27,367 --> 01:03:31,883
You sure are one smart lady.

690
01:03:32,367 --> 01:03:33,356
Move!

691
01:03:36,327 --> 01:03:38,761
You were wonderful !

692
01:03:44,126 --> 01:03:45,923
Shut up! Lock him up.

693
01:03:46,286 --> 01:03:49,119
I'll shut up, but please don't put me behind bars.

694
01:03:49,487 --> 01:03:51,876
Keep quiet now, Aachchan. - How can I, uncle?

695
01:03:52,286 --> 01:03:55,119
It's only a matter of one night. As soon as the court opens tomorrow. . .

696
01:03:55,487 --> 01:04:00,117
I'll have you released on bail. - But what about the wedding?

697
01:04:00,487 --> 01:04:04,480
If this wedding isn't stalled, Yusuf will commit suicide.

698
01:04:04,806 --> 01:04:07,923
Yusuf is more dear to me than he is to you.

699
01:04:08,286 --> 01:04:10,959
I'll never let it take place. I'll go right now and stall it.

700
01:04:11,407 --> 01:04:12,476
Come! - Go.

701
01:04:13,407 --> 01:04:18,242
Send my Dilawarjang over, he can't sleep without me. My champion cock.

702
01:04:18,726 --> 01:04:23,163
No bedding arrangements in jail? - It will be done, get inside.

703
01:04:27,527 --> 01:04:29,677
The groom's procession has arrived.

704
01:04:32,447 --> 01:04:36,360
Your love has arrived. I'll go see how he looks as a groom.

705
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:39,846
Bilkis, can't I see him?

706
01:04:40,286 --> 01:04:44,882
Why get so desperate, you can see him after the wedding.

707
01:04:56,686 --> 01:05:00,679
Oh, it is you. - Do you know him too, Mirza?

708
01:05:01,086 --> 01:05:04,476
He has conducted my wedding thrice. Maybe for the fourth one too. . .

709
01:05:09,367 --> 01:05:10,356
Move aside.

710
01:05:24,487 --> 01:05:29,845
Aunt, where is the groom? - There he is, in the flowery veil.

711
01:05:35,646 --> 01:05:41,882
But he is someone else. - He's Nawab Sikander Mirza, the groom

712
01:05:43,166 --> 01:05:44,963
Nawab Sikandar Mirza? - Yes.

713
01:05:45,646 --> 01:05:46,715
Good God !

714
01:05:56,447 --> 01:06:00,486
How does the groom look? Tell me, please.

715
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:05,478
Zeenat, you're ruined ! - What happened?

716
01:06:06,327 --> 01:06:09,319
Your groom is not Yusuf, but Nawab Sikander Mirza.

717
01:06:20,367 --> 01:06:24,883
No one must be as pleased about your marriage as I am.

718
01:06:25,286 --> 01:06:29,359
It's all due to my prayers that this has happened.

719
01:06:29,686 --> 01:06:33,759
I beg of you, Bilkis, let me go for some time.

720
01:06:34,166 --> 01:06:37,284
I want to meet Yusuf and know how and why this happened.

721
01:06:37,646 --> 01:06:40,480
Help me, please. - But where will you go?

722
01:06:43,367 --> 01:06:46,961
I'll go to the mosque. We promised to meet there every Friday.

723
01:06:47,407 --> 01:06:51,446
Today is also Friday. If he's also in the dark about this like me. . .

724
01:06:51,806 --> 01:06:53,797
then he must surely be waiting for me.

725
01:06:54,487 --> 01:07:00,197
I'll tell him to save me, my life is being ruined.

726
01:07:00,806 --> 01:07:05,482
Don't be crazy. If they ask me about you, what will I tell them?

727
01:07:06,447 --> 01:07:10,122
The groom is already here, the marriage is about to be performed.

728
01:07:10,487 --> 01:07:14,081
If not me, at least think of your family repute.

729
01:07:14,487 --> 01:07:17,284
If you go away, your family will be disgraced.

730
01:07:17,686 --> 01:07:22,157
I promise you, if I don't find him, or if he doesn't help me. . .

731
01:07:22,487 --> 01:07:26,162
then I'll return before the marriage can take place. . .

732
01:07:27,206 --> 01:07:31,165
and sacrifice myself at the altar of family honour.

733
01:07:32,327 --> 01:07:36,002
But before dying, allow me to try and live for once.

734
01:07:37,126 --> 01:07:38,161
Then go.

735
01:07:39,967 --> 01:07:45,758
But remember, until you return, my life will be at stake.

736
01:07:46,206 --> 01:07:47,878
Trust me, Bilkis.

737
01:07:49,527 --> 01:07:50,516
Wait!

738
01:07:52,686 --> 01:07:57,282
Wear this cloak. People will suspect if they see you in bride's finery.

739
01:07:57,686 --> 01:08:00,121
My and my family's honour is in your hands.

740
01:08:00,487 --> 01:08:04,195
Ensure that no one comes to know about this.

741
01:08:17,287 --> 01:08:20,882
To take permission from the bride, arrange for a lawyer and witnesses.

742
01:08:21,287 --> 01:08:23,278
Until then, I'll finalise other arrangements here.

743
01:08:23,646 --> 01:08:25,079
Of course.

744
01:08:27,167 --> 01:08:30,284
Come, you can see the bride.

745
01:08:33,447 --> 01:08:35,881
What are you doing aunt, please go out.

746
01:08:36,247 --> 01:08:40,126
Why, what happened? - The bride has fainted due to heat.

747
01:08:40,487 --> 01:08:43,637
Send me some ice. - God help my child.

748
01:08:44,046 --> 01:08:46,002
Please hurry, aunt.

749
01:08:48,487 --> 01:08:53,480
No one will go in now, you can see the bride later. Please leave.

750
01:09:13,487 --> 01:09:17,877
It's so long, but Zeenat hasn't returned yet.

751
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:21,478
God knows what's going to happen.

752
01:09:22,487 --> 01:09:28,198
What do I do now? What have you done, Zeenat?

753
01:09:28,846 --> 01:09:35,479
''The agony of my heart is almost fatal today''

754
01:09:49,087 --> 01:09:54,957
''Where will I find you now that I pine for you?''

755
01:10:21,487 --> 01:10:25,957
''Neither does the earth offer me sympathy, nor do the skies''

756
01:10:26,966 --> 01:10:34,964
''Separated from you, where shall be my abode?''

757
01:10:36,487 --> 01:10:40,957
''I implore you. . . ''

758
01:10:41,287 --> 01:10:48,079
''you shall forsake the world for me. . . ''

759
01:10:49,167 --> 01:10:51,965
''this shall be your severe most test. . . ''

760
01:10:52,846 --> 01:10:57,966
''this shall be my most severe test''

761
01:10:58,487 --> 01:11:01,479
''On one hand is your love, on the other is the world''

762
01:11:01,686 --> 01:11:05,474
''How I shall find you?''

763
01:11:18,487 --> 01:11:26,962
''With your memories, with my desire for you. . . ''

764
01:11:28,487 --> 01:11:36,962
''my heart is sinking in the embers of love today''

765
01:11:37,487 --> 01:11:43,960
''Life is at a strange crossroad. . . ''

766
01:11:50,846 --> 01:11:54,475
''with the bier of my unfulfilled desires. . . ''

767
01:11:55,487 --> 01:11:58,957
''where shall I find you?''

768
01:12:16,487 --> 01:12:19,479
''Heed the cry of your dear beloved''

769
01:12:19,686 --> 01:12:22,484
''There's a fire in his breath''

770
01:12:22,686 --> 01:12:25,247
''O dear beloved, say something please''

771
01:12:25,487 --> 01:12:29,957
''My agony is unbearable. . . ''

772
01:12:30,287 --> 01:12:32,960
''where will I find you?''

773
01:12:41,846 --> 01:12:47,956
''Where shall I find you at a time like this?''

774
01:12:59,487 --> 01:13:03,365
My child. . . has Zeenat recovered?

775
01:13:03,766 --> 01:13:06,155
You are bothering me! Should I take care of you or the bride?

776
01:13:06,487 --> 01:13:09,159
The lawyer and witnesses are going to come here to take her consent.

777
01:13:09,487 --> 01:13:12,922
But you don't let anyone inside. Move aside, let me see her.

778
01:13:13,327 --> 01:13:15,681
Don't see her. - Why not?

779
01:13:16,087 --> 01:13:18,885
The family and her honour is at stake.

780
01:13:19,287 --> 01:13:21,676
And here you are, stopping me. Move aside.

781
01:13:23,487 --> 01:13:26,159
Zeenat, my child. . .

782
01:13:26,567 --> 01:13:29,444
Aunt, don't raise her veil.

783
01:13:29,846 --> 01:13:33,475
Why not? Move away!

784
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:39,480
Good God ! Where is Zeenat?

785
01:13:40,487 --> 01:13:44,162
She'll come soon.

786
01:13:45,287 --> 01:13:48,279
But where did she go?

787
01:13:48,766 --> 01:13:51,963
She's just gone out, she'll be back soon.

788
01:13:52,327 --> 01:13:55,797
Is this the time to go out? Damn you !

789
01:13:56,207 --> 01:14:01,155
Have you put this family's honour at stake?

790
01:14:01,886 --> 01:14:05,880
Where did you send her? - I didn't do anything.

791
01:14:06,287 --> 01:14:09,802
She went on her own. - Sure, but where did she go?

792
01:14:10,247 --> 01:14:12,283
What should I do now?

793
01:14:12,686 --> 01:14:18,125
Tell me where you sent her. Why don't you speak?

794
01:14:18,487 --> 01:14:21,284
Draw the curtains, the lawyer and witnesses are coming.

795
01:14:25,287 --> 01:14:26,275
Please enter.

796
01:14:27,487 --> 01:14:28,475
Please come.

797
01:14:36,487 --> 01:14:37,475
Come in.

798
01:14:40,527 --> 01:14:42,961
May I? - Of course.

799
01:14:43,487 --> 01:14:44,475
Zeenat. . .

800
01:14:44,726 --> 01:14:48,197
God knows who she is. Pick her up and take her inside.

801
01:14:51,726 --> 01:14:53,557
I think she's feeling shy.

802
01:14:55,487 --> 01:14:59,115
Do you accept me as your lawyer, and allow me. . .

803
01:14:59,487 --> 01:15:04,117
to marry you off to Nawab Sikander Mirza. . .

804
01:15:04,487 --> 01:15:09,480
against a consideration of Rs 1,00,000?

805
01:15:16,567 --> 01:15:22,914
Zeenat, do you accept me as your lawyer, and allow me. . .

806
01:15:23,327 --> 01:15:27,161
to marry you off to Nawab Sikander Mirza. . .

807
01:15:27,487 --> 01:15:30,479
against a consideration of Rs, 1,00,000?

808
01:15:37,207 --> 01:15:39,198
What happened? Why isn't Zeenat replying?

809
01:16:04,287 --> 01:16:08,199
Do you accept me as your lawyer and allow me. . .

810
01:16:08,527 --> 01:16:13,282
to marry you off to Nawab Sikander Mirza. . .

811
01:16:13,646 --> 01:16:18,198
against a consideration of Rs, 1,00,000?

812
01:16:20,407 --> 01:16:22,681
She has said yes. Let's go.

813
01:16:32,527 --> 01:16:33,515
She has agreed.

814
01:16:41,527 --> 01:16:43,483
Priest, the bride has given her consent.

815
01:16:43,726 --> 01:16:48,197
You can perform the marriage now. - Please do, priest.

816
01:16:52,447 --> 01:16:57,202
What happened was destined. But we'll have to somehow save face now.

817
01:16:57,606 --> 01:17:00,121
But how? - Leave that to me.

818
01:17:00,487 --> 01:17:05,197
You go out and keep yourself in control. This is going to be tough.

819
01:17:05,646 --> 01:17:09,195
Please go, for God's sake.

820
01:17:12,287 --> 01:17:13,275
Oh God !

821
01:17:24,447 --> 01:17:27,199
Take, have these sweets. God bless your marriage.

822
01:17:28,247 --> 01:17:29,475
Congratulations!

823
01:17:45,447 --> 01:17:47,483
She had probably come alone to the mosque.

824
01:17:48,167 --> 01:17:50,158
No one has come looking for her.

825
01:17:50,487 --> 01:17:56,323
She's dressed in bridal finery. - She looks like a new bride.

826
01:18:19,487 --> 01:18:20,966
My sister-in-law is here!

827
01:18:36,487 --> 01:18:39,922
Spread flowers for her welcome. Give them to me.

828
01:18:40,327 --> 01:18:43,046
My sister-in-law is here.

829
01:18:49,447 --> 01:18:51,438
Brother, please come.

830
01:18:53,447 --> 01:18:56,199
Brother, congratulations! - To you too.

831
01:18:56,527 --> 01:18:58,961
Get my sister-in-law into the house soon.

832
01:18:59,367 --> 01:19:01,516
Yes, don't be so impatient.

833
01:19:01,926 --> 01:19:04,838
No Suraiya, until the Nawab gives you your due. . .

834
01:19:05,247 --> 01:19:07,078
don't take the bride in.

835
01:19:09,487 --> 01:19:12,001
By bringing me my sister-in-law, my brother has given me everything.

836
01:19:12,367 --> 01:19:15,164
I don't want anything else. Hurry, ask her to come out.

837
01:19:15,487 --> 01:19:17,478
Yes.

838
01:19:23,447 --> 01:19:24,435
Brother!

839
01:19:35,447 --> 01:19:37,483
Where are the men who bought the palanquin?

840
01:19:38,287 --> 01:19:39,878
What happened, brother? - Tell them to carry. . .

841
01:19:40,167 --> 01:19:41,998
the palanquin to the bride's room. - Why?

842
01:19:42,287 --> 01:19:44,721
Your sister-in-law has fainted. - Oh my God !

843
01:19:47,447 --> 01:19:48,675
Hurry!

844
01:19:51,487 --> 01:19:54,239
Please move aside, the bride has fainted.

845
01:19:54,606 --> 01:19:56,484
What's wrong with her?

846
01:20:41,247 --> 01:20:44,478
Brother! Why do you look so scared?

847
01:20:45,127 --> 01:20:49,757
You needed a sister-in-law and this house needed a mistress.

848
01:20:50,487 --> 01:20:54,877
Go, bring them both out. Go on !

849
01:21:04,247 --> 01:21:06,681
Oh my God ! The palanquin is empty!

850
01:21:10,487 --> 01:21:15,480
How did this happen? - I have no idea.

851
01:21:16,367 --> 01:21:19,484
The palanquin came from the Sultan's house.

852
01:21:20,287 --> 01:21:25,485
How the palanquin turned into my coffin, I don't know.

853
01:21:26,487 --> 01:21:31,117
What will happen now? When the ladies will want to see her. . .

854
01:21:31,487 --> 01:21:35,115
what reply will I give them?

855
01:21:38,487 --> 01:21:40,478
I'll go right now and ask Mr Sultan.

856
01:21:41,487 --> 01:21:43,876
If the palanquin has come empty from his house. . .

857
01:21:44,247 --> 01:21:48,126
I swear, I'll kill him and myself.

858
01:21:48,487 --> 01:21:51,126
Hush ! If someone hears you, we'll be doomed.

859
01:21:51,487 --> 01:21:57,561
We are already doomed. Our reputation is ruined.

860
01:21:57,966 --> 01:21:59,957
What is left now that I should worry about?

861
01:22:00,287 --> 01:22:03,006
No brother, don't go there in such a situation.

862
01:22:03,407 --> 01:22:06,877
I beg of you ! - Then give me poison.

863
01:22:07,287 --> 01:22:10,836
Or burn down this mansion so that even I turn to ashes with it.

864
01:22:11,207 --> 01:22:15,485
No brother, I won't let us or our family name be disgraced.

865
01:22:15,846 --> 01:22:19,362
Don't worry, I'll not let anyone enter this room.

866
01:22:19,766 --> 01:22:22,838
I'll tell them the bride is sick. - But until when?

867
01:22:23,207 --> 01:22:25,198
This secret will be out, sooner or later.

868
01:22:25,487 --> 01:22:30,117
Let's leave tomorrow to God. We'll somehow have to save face today.

869
01:22:30,487 --> 01:22:33,047
You go out and take care of the guests.

870
01:22:33,447 --> 01:22:35,721
For God's sake, please go.

871
01:22:48,527 --> 01:22:50,881
Where am I? - At the mosque.

872
01:22:52,407 --> 01:22:57,197
Mosque? What is the time? - It's past mid-night.

873
01:22:59,247 --> 01:23:02,284
Midnight? It's past midnight?

874
01:23:03,207 --> 01:23:05,436
Oh my God ! I'm ruined !

875
01:23:36,287 --> 01:23:40,280
Father. . . - Who is it?

876
01:23:42,207 --> 01:23:44,767
Your daughter. - My daughter?

877
01:23:46,407 --> 01:23:50,161
But she's got married. She's gone away to her in-laws.

878
01:23:51,367 --> 01:23:56,157
Who are you? - I'm Zeenat, father. Your Zeenat.

879
01:24:00,487 --> 01:24:03,284
My Zeenat was the light of this house.

880
01:24:04,367 --> 01:24:09,487
She was the apple of my eye. But she has dishonoured us and left.

881
01:24:10,127 --> 01:24:12,243
Father, please forgive me.

882
01:24:12,686 --> 01:24:18,125
I'll repent for the mistake I have made all my life.

883
01:24:18,766 --> 01:24:21,644
Please forgive your daughter, father.

884
01:24:22,367 --> 01:24:27,885
Which daughter are you talking of? I loved you so much.

885
01:24:29,487 --> 01:24:31,761
I reared you with affection.

886
01:24:32,646 --> 01:24:37,242
But you grew up and disgraced me and your family.

887
01:24:38,287 --> 01:24:40,881
It is destiny that has done this father,. . .

888
01:24:41,287 --> 01:24:44,119
I didn't do anything on purpose.

889
01:24:44,926 --> 01:24:49,045
You have done what no daughter has ever done to her father.

890
01:24:50,606 --> 01:24:54,485
I desired to see you as a bride. . .

891
01:24:55,487 --> 01:24:59,844
to marry you off with great pomp.

892
01:25:01,367 --> 01:25:04,484
But instead, you have ruined so many of us.

893
01:25:05,527 --> 01:25:09,202
You bought me dishonour, you bought ill-repute to Nawab Sikander.

894
01:25:10,407 --> 01:25:13,637
You are dead for me, your coffin has been laid.

895
01:25:14,287 --> 01:25:16,083
Go away from here, go away!

896
01:25:17,487 --> 01:25:21,639
Where do I go leaving your house, father?

897
01:25:22,367 --> 01:25:26,201
Instead of throwing me out of this house, kill me.

898
01:25:26,527 --> 01:25:29,962
You are already dead and the dead don't return to life.

899
01:25:30,367 --> 01:25:32,483
Go away! Get lost!

900
01:25:36,407 --> 01:25:39,239
Father, please pardon my mistake.

901
01:26:13,327 --> 01:26:14,476
Yusuf. . .

902
01:26:34,447 --> 01:26:35,435
Wait.

903
01:26:39,367 --> 01:26:41,961
Who are you? - I. . .

904
01:26:44,646 --> 01:26:47,479
Where is Yusuf? - What work do you have with him?

905
01:26:49,247 --> 01:26:55,163
I'm in trouble. Please tell me where Yusuf is.

906
01:26:56,006 --> 01:26:57,884
He's gone to Allahabad.

907
01:27:00,407 --> 01:27:03,762
Yes, he'll return only after two three months.

908
01:27:04,327 --> 01:27:08,081
He asked me to give a suitable excuse to anyone who comes asking for him.

909
01:27:10,127 --> 01:27:12,846
No, he can't do that!

910
01:27:13,487 --> 01:27:16,126
He can't cheat me like that.

911
01:27:16,487 --> 01:27:20,240
Oh, so he has cheated you too?

912
01:27:21,287 --> 01:27:23,278
What? - Every 2-4 days. . .

913
01:27:23,646 --> 01:27:26,764
some poor girl comes to me.

914
01:27:27,247 --> 01:27:29,283
And I have to somehow console her and send her back.

915
01:27:29,646 --> 01:27:35,085
He is my nephew, but he's a loafer, a womaniser.

916
01:27:38,407 --> 01:27:41,204
A loafer? A womaniser?

917
01:27:44,287 --> 01:27:50,521
Are you Zeenat, Sultan's daughter, the wife of Nawab Sikander?

918
01:27:54,487 --> 01:27:58,082
The daughter and daughter-in-law. . .

919
01:27:58,487 --> 01:28:03,197
of such reputed families cannot be so ill-fated and shameless.

920
01:28:05,686 --> 01:28:10,077
I feel pity for you. Come, I'll see you off.

921
01:28:10,527 --> 01:28:13,917
Leave my hand, I'll go myself. - It's a dark night, don't go alone.

922
01:28:14,327 --> 01:28:17,842
If you meet another Yusuf, he'll rob you of your jewellery and dignity too.

923
01:28:18,247 --> 01:28:20,043
Leave my hand.

924
01:28:35,487 --> 01:28:40,163
If she really was Zeenat, Nawab Sikander is now in my clutches.

925
01:29:10,118 --> 01:29:16,830
''Could this be just a flight of fantasy. . . ?''

926
01:29:18,358 --> 01:29:23,351
''or is there really a beautiful face behind the veil?''

927
01:29:28,358 --> 01:29:31,828
''What do your eyes seek in that direction?''

928
01:29:32,358 --> 01:29:36,351
''Who knows, what secret the veil conceals''

929
01:29:53,837 --> 01:29:57,831
''What shall I call these traits of yours?''

930
01:29:58,358 --> 01:30:02,351
''Shall I be grateful to them, or hold them responsible for my plight?''

931
01:30:16,358 --> 01:30:19,828
''Tyranny cloaked in every act of kindness. . . ''

932
01:30:20,358 --> 01:30:23,828
''infidelity behind every facade of loyalty. . . ''

933
01:30:25,358 --> 01:30:29,828
''everything he does is well-disguised''

934
01:30:36,757 --> 01:30:41,831
''Could this be just a flight of fantasy. . . ?''

935
01:30:44,557 --> 01:30:49,234
We'll take your leave now, we've taken enough of your time.

936
01:30:50,358 --> 01:30:54,873
You and your bride must be cursing us.

937
01:30:57,158 --> 01:30:58,146
Yes.

938
01:30:59,158 --> 01:31:02,070
Look at him, he's left before us.

939
01:31:03,118 --> 01:31:05,552
The Nawab has lost control over himself.

940
01:31:06,158 --> 01:31:09,355
The occasion itself is such.

941
01:31:31,158 --> 01:31:32,352
Nawab. . .

942
01:31:35,078 --> 01:31:36,067
You?

943
01:31:38,198 --> 01:31:41,793
I want to say something.

944
01:31:44,278 --> 01:31:47,030
What have you done? You disappeared from. . .

945
01:31:47,478 --> 01:31:49,992
the palanquin, don't you have any regard for my honour?

946
01:31:50,358 --> 01:31:52,997
Why are you quiet? Give me a reply. - Who is she?

947
01:31:53,358 --> 01:31:55,712
Whom are you getting annoyed at? - What happened?

948
01:31:56,118 --> 01:31:58,871
I don't even know her. She seems to be a mad woman. . .

949
01:32:26,877 --> 01:32:29,710
Goodbye! Take some rest.

950
01:33:31,518 --> 01:33:33,827
Halt! Stop the carriage.

951
01:33:34,797 --> 01:33:36,025
What is it?

952
01:33:38,078 --> 01:33:40,831
What happened? - A woman is lying on the road.

953
01:33:41,198 --> 01:33:42,392
Woman? - Yes.

954
01:33:42,837 --> 01:33:43,826
Let's check.

955
01:34:05,837 --> 01:34:08,226
Dilawarjang, where is Aachchan?

956
01:34:08,877 --> 01:34:11,027
Say something.

957
01:34:11,438 --> 01:34:15,511
How is aunt Kariman's hen? Have you fallen in love with her or not?

958
01:34:16,597 --> 01:34:18,554
How heartless you are. Look at me.

959
01:34:18,837 --> 01:34:23,274
I've lost my peace of mind because I haven't seen her since so many days.

960
01:34:23,677 --> 01:34:26,145
Look what I have bought for her.

961
01:34:27,677 --> 01:34:31,226
Earrings, necklace. . .

962
01:34:32,837 --> 01:34:36,068
and these fabulous ornaments.

963
01:34:36,757 --> 01:34:41,831
And see these silk clothes, they are among the best.

964
01:34:42,278 --> 01:34:45,827
Throw away the jewellery, burn those clothes.

965
01:34:46,358 --> 01:34:49,270
What are you saying? Why should I do that?

966
01:34:49,677 --> 01:34:52,032
Destiny has cheated you, friend.

967
01:34:53,037 --> 01:34:56,393
In your absence, Zeenat was married off to Nawab Sikander.

968
01:34:56,797 --> 01:35:00,426
What? Please don't play such a dirty joke on me.

969
01:35:00,837 --> 01:35:05,194
Fate has played a joke on you. I tried very hard to stall this marriage.

970
01:35:05,957 --> 01:35:08,596
But instead, I ended up in jail.

971
01:35:09,877 --> 01:35:14,076
I don't understand any of this. Zeenat had promised me undying love.

972
01:35:14,478 --> 01:35:16,514
She had said she'd never marry anyone else.

973
01:35:16,837 --> 01:35:19,476
How did this marriage take place? - God knows how.

974
01:35:19,837 --> 01:35:22,431
What can a helpless girl do?

975
01:35:22,837 --> 01:35:25,590
She must have surrendered before her father's wishes.

976
01:35:25,957 --> 01:35:28,232
I'll kill such a heartless father.

977
01:35:28,637 --> 01:35:30,390
Where is that man who traded his daughter?

978
01:35:30,637 --> 01:35:32,309
Where is that slave of wealth?

979
01:35:32,837 --> 01:35:36,068
I'll burn down this house, so that Sultan turns to ashes. . .

980
01:35:36,478 --> 01:35:38,514
the way he burned my love to ashes.

981
01:35:38,877 --> 01:35:41,438
Sit down. Why are you unnecessarily creating a scene?

982
01:35:41,797 --> 01:35:45,585
It's all over now. Zeenat is already the wife of Nawab Sikander.

983
01:35:45,957 --> 01:35:48,073
No one can break that relationship now.

984
01:35:48,438 --> 01:35:51,510
I will break that relationship. I'll bring back my Zeenat.

985
01:35:51,837 --> 01:35:54,829
Sit down ! Why get desperate? Do you know its consequences?

986
01:35:55,597 --> 01:35:57,475
Zeenat will be defamed.

987
01:35:57,837 --> 01:35:59,634
Zeenat will be defamed?

988
01:36:00,037 --> 01:36:04,827
This was not fair.

989
01:36:23,037 --> 01:36:27,394
Since you've recovered, you haven't eaten anything.

990
01:36:28,198 --> 01:36:29,711
Here, have something.

991
01:36:34,238 --> 01:36:40,234
You helped me, how can I ever repay you?

992
01:36:42,158 --> 01:36:45,468
Don't say that, it was my duty.

993
01:36:46,238 --> 01:36:48,627
The way you were lying on the road. . .

994
01:36:49,238 --> 01:36:52,230
anyone would have done just that.

995
01:36:53,318 --> 01:36:57,869
Tell me, who are you, where do you live?

996
01:36:59,358 --> 01:37:03,909
I don't remember who I am, where I have come from.

997
01:37:05,118 --> 01:37:07,347
I have no house, no place to go.

998
01:37:08,238 --> 01:37:10,592
All doors are closed on me.

999
01:37:11,398 --> 01:37:15,231
Tell me about it, I'll try to help you.

1000
01:37:16,198 --> 01:37:19,713
The doors that have closed on you, can be opened again.

1001
01:37:20,118 --> 01:37:22,871
I have myself closed those doors, mother.

1002
01:37:24,238 --> 01:37:27,036
You have called me mother. . .

1003
01:37:28,118 --> 01:37:31,235
and a mother hides her daughter's every secret.

1004
01:37:32,238 --> 01:37:38,950
Tell me your story, I promise I won't tell anyone.

1005
01:37:39,438 --> 01:37:43,875
Please send me back to the streets if you like. . .

1006
01:37:44,238 --> 01:37:47,913
but don't ask me the cause of my ruin.

1007
01:37:49,478 --> 01:37:53,471
All right, but I was asking for your good only.

1008
01:37:55,037 --> 01:37:57,790
If you ever feel like, tell me all about it.

1009
01:38:10,037 --> 01:38:12,597
Sir, the Nawab is here.

1010
01:38:15,238 --> 01:38:19,231
Nawab, who? - Sikander Mirza, your son-in-law.

1011
01:38:21,037 --> 01:38:24,825
Look at him, he's worried just hearing his son-in-law's name.

1012
01:38:25,238 --> 01:38:28,230
Get up, go and welcome him.

1013
01:38:31,438 --> 01:38:32,472
Please come.

1014
01:38:35,997 --> 01:38:39,990
Greetings! - Bless you. Please sit down.

1015
01:38:44,238 --> 01:38:47,867
Forgive me, your daughter should have come actually. . .

1016
01:38:48,238 --> 01:38:50,512
but she fell sick.

1017
01:38:51,238 --> 01:38:53,627
Don't worry, she'll visit you in a few days.

1018
01:38:54,037 --> 01:38:56,028
She has sent a message for you.

1019
01:38:57,438 --> 01:38:59,905
We'll take your leave. Goodbye!

1020
01:39:10,358 --> 01:39:12,747
Don't do that, please get up.

1021
01:39:16,238 --> 01:39:21,631
You saved my dignity, you saved me from being disgraced.

1022
01:39:23,238 --> 01:39:25,798
You are not human, but an angel.

1023
01:39:27,438 --> 01:39:31,828
I know the palanquin left empty from here.

1024
01:39:32,597 --> 01:39:34,588
And it reached empty.

1025
01:39:35,557 --> 01:39:38,868
You don't know what befell us in one night. . .

1026
01:39:39,238 --> 01:39:41,706
how we have saved our honour and yours.

1027
01:39:42,238 --> 01:39:45,230
Tell me why this happened, please.

1028
01:39:46,158 --> 01:39:50,037
That only she can reply, who bought me humiliation.

1029
01:39:50,637 --> 01:39:52,707
But why did she take this wrong step?

1030
01:39:53,318 --> 01:39:55,229
Did she want to marry someone else?

1031
01:39:55,637 --> 01:39:58,948
Honestly Nawab, I don't know anything about it.

1032
01:40:00,037 --> 01:40:03,632
If I had known, I wouldn't have cheated you. . .

1033
01:40:04,037 --> 01:40:06,028
I would have buried her alive. . .

1034
01:40:06,957 --> 01:40:11,235
but wouldn't have tried to marry her off to a decent man like you.

1035
01:40:12,997 --> 01:40:16,592
I don't know what is the secret behind this incident.

1036
01:40:18,158 --> 01:40:20,228
What's surprising is that she visited me last night.

1037
01:40:20,557 --> 01:40:23,630
What. . . ? - Yes. She stood behind a pillar.

1038
01:40:24,118 --> 01:40:28,430
I said something to her. For a moment I turned away, and she disappeared.

1039
01:40:28,997 --> 01:40:32,956
She had come here too, but I condemned here.

1040
01:40:35,238 --> 01:40:37,957
And she left. - But where did she go?

1041
01:40:38,438 --> 01:40:43,386
In anger, I told her to go die. She must have killed herself.

1042
01:40:47,318 --> 01:40:48,989
She must be dead.

1043
01:40:49,278 --> 01:40:54,226
Don't say that. It is possible she is alive and returns someday.

1044
01:40:55,238 --> 01:40:58,867
Until then, we'll have to forget that. . .

1045
01:40:59,238 --> 01:41:02,867
the palanquin left empty from here, and arrived empty at my house.

1046
01:41:04,198 --> 01:41:10,956
The world still thinks that your daughter is my wife and is with me.

1047
01:41:14,773 --> 01:41:22,168
''What was my destination supposed to be?''

1048
01:41:24,012 --> 01:41:31,488
''I know not where I have landed''

1049
01:42:16,412 --> 01:42:19,404
''What destination had I set out for. . . ''

1050
01:42:19,613 --> 01:42:23,003
''and where have I landed, I do not know''

1051
01:42:28,773 --> 01:42:32,481
''My feet now falter. . . ''

1052
01:42:33,012 --> 01:42:36,483
''they know not where my goal is''

1053
01:43:12,493 --> 01:43:21,492
''I too dreamt of Spring in my own little Eden''

1054
01:43:30,012 --> 01:43:36,485
''When flowers withered away, when autumn arrived. . . I do not know''

1055
01:43:37,012 --> 01:43:41,483
''When autumn had arrived, I did not realise''

1056
01:43:42,412 --> 01:43:46,007
''My feet now falter. . . ''

1057
01:43:46,653 --> 01:43:50,009
''I do not know where my goal is''

1058
01:44:12,012 --> 01:44:16,483
''My heart burnt in sorrow. . . ''

1059
01:44:16,653 --> 01:44:21,488
''my dreams lay shattered''

1060
01:44:30,012 --> 01:44:36,485
''What burns in my heart, what smoke emanates. . . I do not know''

1061
01:44:37,012 --> 01:44:41,483
''What smoke rises. . . ? I have no clue''

1062
01:44:42,372 --> 01:44:45,489
''My feet now falter. . . ''

1063
01:44:46,012 --> 01:44:50,006
''I do not know where my goal is''

1064
01:45:25,493 --> 01:45:28,485
''Whom and how shall I tell the story. . . ''

1065
01:45:29,012 --> 01:45:34,484
''of my love that was destroyed?''

1066
01:45:43,493 --> 01:45:49,489
''My lips are sealed and the world knows not what my tears convey''

1067
01:45:50,212 --> 01:45:54,490
''They know not what my tears convey''

1068
01:45:55,332 --> 01:45:58,005
''What was my destination supposed to be?''

1069
01:45:58,212 --> 01:46:01,488
''I know not where I have landed''

1070
01:46:07,372 --> 01:46:10,489
''My feet now falter. . . ''

1071
01:46:11,493 --> 01:46:15,486
''I know not where my goal lies''

1072
01:46:49,012 --> 01:46:50,844
Where've I ended up, my God?

1073
01:46:51,212 --> 01:46:55,683
Don't punish me so severely for my mistake. Save me, please.

1074
01:47:21,453 --> 01:47:24,013
Naziranbai is very smart.

1075
01:47:25,012 --> 01:47:28,368
She keeps such beauties in veils.

1076
01:47:28,813 --> 01:47:33,603
How dare you? Leave her alone.

1077
01:47:34,853 --> 01:47:38,003
I can afford to pay for her.

1078
01:47:39,252 --> 01:47:44,007
Rs 5,000, Rs 10,000, Rs 20,000.

1079
01:47:46,012 --> 01:47:47,650
Tell me her price.

1080
01:47:48,012 --> 01:47:55,408
This may be a whore house, but there are some corners here. . .

1081
01:47:55,813 --> 01:47:58,007
that are more pure then your mansions.

1082
01:47:59,212 --> 01:48:02,648
By trying to assault a pure woman, you have committed a sin. . .

1083
01:48:03,012 --> 01:48:05,003
which God will never pardon.

1084
01:48:06,733 --> 01:48:09,690
If you want to save face, leave immediately. . .

1085
01:48:10,012 --> 01:48:12,003
or I'll have you thrown out.

1086
01:48:12,332 --> 01:48:18,282
Speak politely. Don't forget you are speaking to Nawab Pyare.

1087
01:48:18,813 --> 01:48:22,646
God knows how many such Nawabs. . .

1088
01:48:23,012 --> 01:48:25,685
I have made and ruined.

1089
01:48:26,052 --> 01:48:29,488
Will you leave or do you want to be thrown out?

1090
01:48:29,893 --> 01:48:34,807
Remember, I'll avenge my humiliation.

1091
01:48:35,252 --> 01:48:36,287
Get lost!

1092
01:48:46,172 --> 01:48:50,688
Where are you going? - Where I can lay myself dead.

1093
01:48:51,932 --> 01:48:53,490
Lay dead?

1094
01:48:59,813 --> 01:49:01,007
Listen child,. . .

1095
01:49:03,012 --> 01:49:08,211
that's what even I had thought when I left home 25 years back.

1096
01:49:10,212 --> 01:49:13,488
I was like you, just like you.

1097
01:49:15,212 --> 01:49:19,125
But I had to wander listlessly.

1098
01:49:21,052 --> 01:49:26,684
I sold my youth and my dignity.

1099
01:49:27,773 --> 01:49:30,525
I lost everything.

1100
01:49:32,932 --> 01:49:37,484
But couldn't find a place where I could lie dead. . . not till today.

1101
01:49:38,972 --> 01:49:43,011
What I got was this whore-house. . .

1102
01:49:44,172 --> 01:49:49,292
and a life that's neither fit for demons nor humans.

1103
01:49:50,813 --> 01:49:53,610
Sleeping during the day, staying awake at night.

1104
01:49:54,012 --> 01:49:56,731
Sorrow in the heart, but a song on the lips.

1105
01:49:57,733 --> 01:50:02,806
Instead of death, I earned humiliation and ill-repute.

1106
01:50:04,653 --> 01:50:09,204
Some called me ill-fated, some called me vile.

1107
01:50:10,012 --> 01:50:14,164
And soon enough, a daughter of a decent family. . .

1108
01:50:15,172 --> 01:50:18,688
this Nazeer Banu. . .

1109
01:50:19,813 --> 01:50:21,644
became Naziranbai.

1110
01:50:22,372 --> 01:50:28,004
Mother! - I was like you.

1111
01:50:29,012 --> 01:50:30,765
Pray to God that you don't become like me.

1112
01:50:32,132 --> 01:50:38,002
I made a mistake, please save me, give me shelter.

1113
01:50:39,853 --> 01:50:43,640
The day a mother cannot save a daughter. . .

1114
01:50:44,012 --> 01:50:46,207
will be doomsday.

1115
01:50:47,012 --> 01:50:52,609
I swear, I'll give up my life. . .

1116
01:50:53,212 --> 01:50:56,170
but won't let your dignity be tarnished.

1117
01:51:14,012 --> 01:51:18,291
Khalima, move away. Where are you going?

1118
01:51:18,813 --> 01:51:20,804
I have told you several times not to enter sister-in-law's room.

1119
01:51:21,172 --> 01:51:23,640
She doesn't want to meet anyone, but you just don't listen.

1120
01:51:25,052 --> 01:51:27,613
I have got a sister-in-law after so many prayers.

1121
01:51:27,972 --> 01:51:31,010
And you want me to let you serve her food? Give it to me.

1122
01:51:31,932 --> 01:51:34,367
Let me serve her to my heart's content first.

1123
01:51:45,132 --> 01:51:46,532
Greetings!

1124
01:51:49,052 --> 01:51:50,690
How are you feeling today?

1125
01:51:52,012 --> 01:51:56,244
Touch wood, but you're glowing today.

1126
01:52:01,212 --> 01:52:03,009
Get up and have your food.

1127
01:52:04,573 --> 01:52:07,007
What did you ask? Has brother eaten?

1128
01:52:09,773 --> 01:52:13,003
You have begun to care for each other so much already.

1129
01:52:13,813 --> 01:52:18,250
You want brother to eat first, and brother wants you to eat first.

1130
01:52:18,813 --> 01:52:21,373
You tell me, whom should I serve food to first?

1131
01:52:22,012 --> 01:52:24,242
Tell me, tell me, please.

1132
01:53:00,573 --> 01:53:07,365
Suraiya, you are this family's dignity, my honour.

1133
01:53:09,212 --> 01:53:11,407
I fear this pretense drive you insane.

1134
01:53:13,493 --> 01:53:19,523
Hey Romeo, I looked for you everywhere. . .

1135
01:53:19,932 --> 01:53:22,810
and here you are. What are you doing here?

1136
01:53:23,212 --> 01:53:25,203
There mustn't be a greater betrayer than you.

1137
01:53:25,972 --> 01:53:31,490
You, uncle, Zeenat, everyone betrayed me.

1138
01:53:32,012 --> 01:53:34,845
Everyone cheated me, no one did anything for me.

1139
01:53:35,212 --> 01:53:36,565
I did nothing? - No.

1140
01:53:36,972 --> 01:53:40,408
I even went to jail for you, what more do you want?

1141
01:53:40,773 --> 01:53:43,333
I have my life which I can sacrifice for you if you say.

1142
01:53:43,733 --> 01:53:46,167
Leave me alone, please go away.

1143
01:53:46,972 --> 01:53:51,649
Now I won't leave you alone. I'll keep you with me in my house.

1144
01:53:52,012 --> 01:53:56,006
If you keep wandering like this, you'll really go crazy. Come with me.

1145
01:53:56,573 --> 01:53:57,561
C'mon !

1146
01:54:04,853 --> 01:54:06,605
Greetings! - Please be seated.

1147
01:54:10,853 --> 01:54:13,730
Did you notice something?

1148
01:54:14,172 --> 01:54:18,688
Within a few days, the Nawab's face has begun to glow.

1149
01:54:19,172 --> 01:54:25,009
It seems like a rose has bloomed with nourishment from an elixir.

1150
01:54:26,092 --> 01:54:29,005
That's all due to the arrival of his wife.

1151
01:54:30,012 --> 01:54:33,641
The house in which a good, decent and beautiful lady comes. . .

1152
01:54:34,012 --> 01:54:36,003
everything in that house glows.

1153
01:54:38,733 --> 01:54:41,770
Madam has sent ' Firni' for you all.

1154
01:54:42,132 --> 01:54:45,010
' Firni' ! Wow!

1155
01:54:49,172 --> 01:54:52,643
The Nawab was always large hearted. . .

1156
01:54:53,012 --> 01:54:56,766
but his wife is even more large hearted.

1157
01:54:57,132 --> 01:54:59,771
Eat, eat as much as you want.

1158
01:55:00,212 --> 01:55:04,999
Pray for the lady.

1159
01:55:08,813 --> 01:55:12,010
God has now blessed you with a wife.

1160
01:55:13,212 --> 01:55:16,010
You now have one more duty to perform. - What is that?

1161
01:55:17,012 --> 01:55:21,722
Suraiya has grown up, it is better you get her married too.

1162
01:55:22,052 --> 01:55:25,840
Yes, I have received a proposal for her from Nawab Sadique's son.

1163
01:55:26,813 --> 01:55:29,247
I think it's a good proposal.

1164
01:55:30,212 --> 01:55:34,649
Ask him to come here and we'll fix the marriage.

1165
01:55:41,012 --> 01:55:42,001
Greetings.

1166
01:55:42,332 --> 01:55:44,004
Welcome.

1167
01:55:46,012 --> 01:55:47,525
Please be seated.

1168
01:55:55,132 --> 01:55:59,206
Is everything all right? - By God's grace, yes.

1169
01:56:00,172 --> 01:56:04,643
I came to tell you I'll be leaving for Haj.

1170
01:56:05,012 --> 01:56:06,650
Congratulations!

1171
01:56:08,012 --> 01:56:10,810
I'll be leaving in a few days time. - Nawab sahib. . .

1172
01:56:11,172 --> 01:56:14,448
Who must be more fortunate than you. . .

1173
01:56:14,853 --> 01:56:16,684
that you yourself are going for Haj. . .

1174
01:56:16,972 --> 01:56:21,568
and your daughter is married into such a good and respected family.

1175
01:56:27,052 --> 01:56:32,001
What are you doing? - I'm preparing to go to the mosque.

1176
01:56:32,893 --> 01:56:34,770
Today is an auspicious Friday.

1177
01:56:36,813 --> 01:56:39,247
Auspicious Friday? - Yes, child.

1178
01:56:40,972 --> 01:56:44,010
Will you take me along? - Of course.

1179
01:56:44,972 --> 01:56:51,162
God is great, he helps all of us, maybe he helps you too.

1180
01:57:02,573 --> 01:57:06,327
What is it, child? Even while coming you had stopped here. . .

1181
01:57:06,733 --> 01:57:10,009
and now while leaving too. Any special reason?

1182
01:57:11,773 --> 01:57:13,842
No. I just stopped.

1183
01:57:22,012 --> 01:57:23,001
Let's go.

1184
01:57:39,212 --> 01:57:40,407
Flowers?

1185
01:57:41,972 --> 01:57:43,485
Are you not well?

1186
01:57:46,012 --> 01:57:50,006
Can I sit here for sometime? - Sure. Come.

1187
01:58:05,172 --> 01:58:07,208
Hey, where are you going?

1188
01:58:15,012 --> 01:58:17,367
What happened? Move aside.

1189
01:58:34,332 --> 01:58:38,610
Are you badly hurt? - No brother, don't worry about me.

1190
01:58:39,012 --> 01:58:44,132
How can I not? You are ruining your life to save my dignity.

1191
01:58:44,573 --> 01:58:46,404
You'll kill yourself!

1192
01:58:50,972 --> 01:58:55,363
Damn ! I had strictly told him not to move around.

1193
01:58:55,853 --> 01:58:58,207
Why did you let him go out in his condition?

1194
01:58:58,853 --> 01:59:02,811
What could I do? Since two days he kept talking about going to the mosque

1195
01:59:03,212 --> 01:59:05,851
I told him not to go, but he wouldn't listen.

1196
01:59:06,212 --> 01:59:09,045
Please save him, he's my only friend.

1197
01:59:09,412 --> 01:59:14,247
He has high fever, it has even affected his brain.

1198
01:59:15,012 --> 01:59:19,164
Utmost care has to be taken. I'll send the medicine.

1199
01:59:20,012 --> 01:59:22,652
If his fever comes down by evening, he'll be fine. . .

1200
01:59:23,012 --> 01:59:25,652
or God save him. - Doctor!

1201
01:59:26,092 --> 01:59:27,412
I'll be going.

1202
01:59:36,972 --> 01:59:39,725
Untimely death is the worst!

1203
01:59:40,172 --> 01:59:42,050
Can't bear to see Aachchan's state!

1204
01:59:49,853 --> 01:59:53,606
Flowers bloom and then wither away.

1205
01:59:54,853 --> 01:59:59,483
But I crave to see those flowers which withered without blooming.

1206
02:00:00,252 --> 02:00:05,485
You mustn't cry. Crying hurts the soul of the departed.

1207
02:00:05,893 --> 02:00:09,168
Control yourself. - How can I keep in control?

1208
02:00:11,773 --> 02:00:15,731
No one must die so young.

1209
02:00:19,012 --> 02:00:22,641
Aachchan, the grave has been dug. Let us lay his coffin.

1210
02:00:23,012 --> 02:00:27,483
No, don't take him away, or even I'll die.

1211
02:00:27,972 --> 02:00:31,760
One who comes into this world has to go one day.

1212
02:00:32,132 --> 02:00:36,809
Death spares no one. Today he has left, tomorrow could be our turn.

1213
02:00:37,212 --> 02:00:39,646
Why didn't I die?

1214
02:00:40,012 --> 02:00:47,488
Friend, take me along, even I'll lie in the grave besides you.

1215
02:00:52,012 --> 02:00:56,643
Aachchan, gather yourself, crying won't make him come back.

1216
02:00:57,012 --> 02:00:59,652
People want to have a last glimpse of the dead.

1217
02:01:00,012 --> 02:01:04,131
Remove the sheet from his face and let us carry out his coffin.

1218
02:01:04,533 --> 02:01:10,802
All right, then give me support or I'll fall unconscious.

1219
02:01:22,012 --> 02:01:28,009
Cry your eyes out. Another such cock will never be born again.

1220
02:01:40,012 --> 02:01:44,802
What are you doing here? I've bought you good news.

1221
02:01:45,212 --> 02:01:48,568
Have you found sister-in-law?

1222
02:01:50,172 --> 02:01:53,483
No, but I've found a younger brother.

1223
02:01:54,092 --> 02:01:56,481
Your marriage has been fixed with the son of Nawab Sadique Ali.

1224
02:01:56,813 --> 02:01:58,769
The engagement is next Friday.

1225
02:02:00,012 --> 02:02:01,492
God bless you.

1226
02:02:02,813 --> 02:02:05,407
Brother. . . - What happened?

1227
02:02:08,012 --> 02:02:12,006
Until now, we had managed to keep this a secret.

1228
02:02:12,813 --> 02:02:16,646
But what will happen now? How will all this happen without sister-in-law?

1229
02:02:17,012 --> 02:02:19,480
Oh yes, I hadn't thought about that.

1230
02:02:20,132 --> 02:02:23,648
How will all this happen without her? What do we do now, Suraiya?

1231
02:02:24,012 --> 02:02:28,689
Nothing, you reject the proposal, and they'll not come here.

1232
02:02:29,092 --> 02:02:31,162
No Suraiya, this is the matter of your entire life.

1233
02:02:31,493 --> 02:02:35,486
Damn my life, this is the matter of our family's honour.

1234
02:02:35,972 --> 02:02:38,327
Reject the proposal, for God's sake.

1235
02:02:38,733 --> 02:02:41,327
Don't say that, let me think.

1236
02:02:49,052 --> 02:02:52,806
Greetings! - Greetings Mr Mir, please take a seat

1237
02:02:53,212 --> 02:02:56,204
How come you're here today? - Check this.

1238
02:02:56,693 --> 02:02:59,253
Has this bangle been bought from your shop?

1239
02:03:00,012 --> 02:03:03,050
Where did you find it? - On the street.

1240
02:03:03,613 --> 02:03:05,842
With the thought of returning it to the right owner. . .

1241
02:03:06,212 --> 02:03:08,407
I'm checking it with every jeweller.

1242
02:03:08,813 --> 02:03:11,087
This bangle has been purchased from my shop.

1243
02:03:11,493 --> 02:03:12,481
Really? - Yes.

1244
02:03:12,813 --> 02:03:18,409
Who had purchased it? - Nawab Sikander Mirza.

1245
02:03:19,012 --> 02:03:21,480
Oh, Nawab Sikander? - Yes.

1246
02:03:21,893 --> 02:03:25,010
Give it to me, I'll return it to the rightful owner.

1247
02:03:29,853 --> 02:03:33,003
Cashier. . . - Yes, sir?

1248
02:03:34,212 --> 02:03:36,009
Mirza, please leave us alone.

1249
02:03:37,813 --> 02:03:40,645
I'm a bit confused and don't know what to do.

1250
02:03:41,012 --> 02:03:45,403
If it's money, I can always help you.

1251
02:03:45,813 --> 02:03:50,603
It's not that. The groom's family is coming for Suraiya's engagement.

1252
02:03:51,012 --> 02:03:55,291
Their coming cannot be stalled. But my wife. . .

1253
02:03:56,653 --> 02:03:58,644
Yes, tell me, is she against the proposal?

1254
02:03:59,012 --> 02:04:01,402
If that's the case, I'll right now. . . - It's not that either.

1255
02:04:03,012 --> 02:04:05,003
Do one thing. - Yes?

1256
02:04:06,012 --> 02:04:10,006
No, I only will have to do this.

1257
02:04:20,012 --> 02:04:21,969
Who is it? You? Folks. . . !

1258
02:04:22,292 --> 02:04:25,489
For God sake, don't shout. I was looking for you since many days.

1259
02:04:25,893 --> 02:04:28,407
Why? You want me arrested again? - No.

1260
02:04:28,813 --> 02:04:32,771
Whatever happened that day was on Mir Kurban Ali's orders.

1261
02:04:33,132 --> 02:04:35,600
On Mir Kurban Ali's orders? But why?

1262
02:04:36,012 --> 02:04:38,003
Come here, I'll tell you.

1263
02:04:42,813 --> 02:04:45,770
Mir Kurban Ali didn't want Yusuf to get married.

1264
02:04:46,092 --> 02:04:48,481
Because the moment he got married, he would ask for his property. . .

1265
02:04:48,893 --> 02:04:50,689
which Kurban Ali has already squandered away.

1266
02:04:51,012 --> 02:04:55,369
I see! Tell me more.

1267
02:04:55,853 --> 02:05:00,005
He keeps promising to marry me.

1268
02:05:00,733 --> 02:05:05,011
Now, after he's ruined my life, he doesn't want to see me.

1269
02:05:05,372 --> 02:05:08,364
Can you repeat all this in court? - Not just the court. . .

1270
02:05:08,773 --> 02:05:10,809
I can repeat it before the whole world.

1271
02:05:11,212 --> 02:05:15,286
Then come with me, I'll teach that Mir a lesson.

1272
02:05:19,212 --> 02:05:24,492
This is no ordinary bangle, it is the key to Nawab Sikander's vaults.

1273
02:05:25,813 --> 02:05:30,250
Use the key and remove as much wealth as possible.

1274
02:05:31,012 --> 02:05:34,688
Within a short period, I'll rob him of all his wealth.

1275
02:05:45,733 --> 02:05:47,246
He's the one.

1276
02:05:55,012 --> 02:05:57,890
You betrayer, enemy of your own child !

1277
02:05:58,252 --> 02:06:03,645
Uncle, I've realised today that it's not blood running in your veins. .

1278
02:06:04,012 --> 02:06:05,684
but soda water.

1279
02:06:06,012 --> 02:06:08,765
What nonsense! What do you want?

1280
02:06:09,613 --> 02:06:12,002
Who are they? - I'll tell you.

1281
02:06:12,773 --> 02:06:16,606
Men, hold him from both sides.

1282
02:06:17,012 --> 02:06:20,688
The man is strong, he may thrash me.

1283
02:06:21,573 --> 02:06:22,608
Proceed !

1284
02:06:24,932 --> 02:06:26,729
Don't dare touch me!

1285
02:06:35,212 --> 02:06:37,248
Aachchan, what crime are you punishing me for?

1286
02:06:39,012 --> 02:06:45,612
Crime one : To usurp his wealth, you ruined Yusuf's life.

1287
02:06:46,172 --> 02:06:49,210
True or false? - That's a lie.

1288
02:06:49,893 --> 02:06:52,487
Men, hit him twice.

1289
02:06:58,012 --> 02:07:01,005
It's true, absolutely true.

1290
02:07:01,493 --> 02:07:08,444
Crime two : You framed me and had me arrested.

1291
02:07:09,012 --> 02:07:10,412
True or false?

1292
02:07:10,733 --> 02:07:15,409
How could I ever do that to you? That's an absolute lie.

1293
02:07:15,853 --> 02:07:19,003
Men, hit him thrice.

1294
02:07:22,012 --> 02:07:23,207
I'll die!

1295
02:07:28,132 --> 02:07:32,922
I must have made a mistake. I admit my crime.

1296
02:07:33,292 --> 02:07:41,006
Crime three : You also ruined the life of the innocent Shagufta.

1297
02:07:41,533 --> 02:07:43,364
Who says so? - Hold him, men.

1298
02:07:45,453 --> 02:07:47,364
Who the hell is Shagufta?

1299
02:07:47,813 --> 02:07:50,565
Oh ! So now you don't know me?

1300
02:07:51,932 --> 02:07:54,322
Men, hit him four times.

1301
02:08:03,932 --> 02:08:05,650
You'll break my neck.

1302
02:08:06,012 --> 02:08:09,243
Doesn't matter, at least you'll come to your senses

1303
02:08:09,813 --> 02:08:12,122
Men, hit him five times.

1304
02:08:16,972 --> 02:08:19,692
Aachchan, have mercy on me. Shagufta, save me.

1305
02:08:21,573 --> 02:08:27,409
So you recognise her now. Do you agree to marry her?

1306
02:08:27,813 --> 02:08:31,646
Marry her? Never! - Men, hit him six times.

1307
02:08:32,733 --> 02:08:35,372
You stay here, one is enough for him.

1308
02:08:35,813 --> 02:08:38,327
You'll kill me. I agree to marry her!

1309
02:08:39,212 --> 02:08:40,201
Bravo!

1310
02:08:43,012 --> 02:08:44,001
Hold him!

1311
02:08:44,932 --> 02:08:47,127
Priest, come in quick.

1312
02:08:57,012 --> 02:08:58,765
Greetings. - Greetings.

1313
02:08:59,132 --> 02:09:00,645
Please sit down.

1314
02:09:03,813 --> 02:09:09,046
You could have called for me, why did you take the trouble?

1315
02:09:10,813 --> 02:09:14,567
Life is a mystery which cannot be solved.

1316
02:09:14,972 --> 02:09:19,011
But my life has become a maze in which I'll get lost.

1317
02:09:20,012 --> 02:09:22,003
If I ask you for something unusual,. . .

1318
02:09:22,332 --> 02:09:24,482
don't ask me the reason behind it, I won't be able to tell you.

1319
02:09:25,012 --> 02:09:27,652
Tell me, I won't ask you anything.

1320
02:09:28,212 --> 02:09:33,492
I need a girl for a day, who has decent mannerisms.

1321
02:09:34,052 --> 02:09:39,570
Who, until my sister gets engaged, can act as my wife.

1322
02:09:40,012 --> 02:09:42,003
God forbid, but your wife. . . ?

1323
02:09:42,453 --> 02:09:45,604
Please don't try to solve that riddle.

1324
02:09:47,932 --> 02:09:52,688
I've come for help. If you refuse, Suraiya's life will be ruined.

1325
02:09:53,412 --> 02:09:55,801
Just for a day, arrange for a decent girl.

1326
02:09:56,332 --> 02:10:00,610
Don't worry, I do know of one such girl.

1327
02:10:01,412 --> 02:10:04,484
Beautiful, decent and pure.

1328
02:10:05,172 --> 02:10:07,606
She'll even go with you.

1329
02:10:08,972 --> 02:10:14,001
But just remember, that her purity isn't tarnished.

1330
02:10:14,733 --> 02:10:19,011
Don't worry. I promise you, I won't even look at her.

1331
02:10:19,893 --> 02:10:21,645
I'll consider her a sacred gift.

1332
02:10:22,733 --> 02:10:26,362
Send her before sunrise and she'll be sent back before sunset.

1333
02:10:26,972 --> 02:10:30,010
Rest assured, the girl will be sent to your mansion.

1334
02:10:44,012 --> 02:10:49,371
Lord, I'm going to begin a new life.

1335
02:10:51,012 --> 02:10:53,480
I'm going to step into a new world.

1336
02:10:55,012 --> 02:10:58,005
Today's day should have been a happy one for me.

1337
02:10:59,813 --> 02:11:01,804
But my heart is full of sorrow.

1338
02:11:03,252 --> 02:11:06,005
Please save this family's honour, my God.

1339
02:11:07,733 --> 02:11:09,769
Send my sister-in-law somehow.

1340
02:11:10,893 --> 02:11:14,646
Suraiya, shall I send the breakfast to madam's room?

1341
02:11:15,012 --> 02:11:17,003
No, wait! I'm coming.

1342
02:11:22,972 --> 02:11:25,282
Give it to me. You all leave.

1343
02:11:43,613 --> 02:11:46,685
Who are you?

1344
02:11:47,813 --> 02:11:49,451
The mistress of this house.

1345
02:11:50,332 --> 02:11:52,004
Mistress of the house?

1346
02:11:53,012 --> 02:11:55,287
God ! What did you do?

1347
02:12:05,573 --> 02:12:08,326
Are you my sister-in-law?

1348
02:12:10,853 --> 02:12:11,841
Yes.

1349
02:12:14,493 --> 02:12:15,608
Sister-in-law. . .

1350
02:12:18,813 --> 02:12:20,007
my sister-in-law!

1351
02:12:22,972 --> 02:12:26,090
Brother! Brother. . . - Hey, listen.

1352
02:12:28,653 --> 02:12:29,768
Wait!

1353
02:12:31,172 --> 02:12:33,128
Madam! Greetings!

1354
02:12:38,372 --> 02:12:41,523
Come here, all of you. Look, madam is here.

1355
02:12:43,172 --> 02:12:47,006
Madam, we're so fortunate to have seen you. Greetings!

1356
02:12:48,813 --> 02:12:51,930
May God bless you !

1357
02:12:52,733 --> 02:12:55,327
Brother, sister-in-law is here.

1358
02:12:55,733 --> 02:12:56,802
Hush !

1359
02:12:58,052 --> 02:13:00,805
She's not your sister-in-law, but her shadow. . .

1360
02:13:01,212 --> 02:13:05,764
which has come with sunrise and will disappear at sunset.

1361
02:13:08,012 --> 02:13:10,685
But she said she was my sister-in-law.

1362
02:13:11,493 --> 02:13:14,246
Just for a day, until you get engaged.

1363
02:13:14,972 --> 02:13:18,283
Don't ask me who she is, where she has come from.

1364
02:13:19,012 --> 02:13:24,484
But she's very beautiful. Her eyes are full of love.

1365
02:13:25,252 --> 02:13:28,563
She really seems to be your wife! - Maybe.

1366
02:13:29,813 --> 02:13:34,011
Haven't you seen her yet? - No, and I won't either.

1367
02:13:34,493 --> 02:13:35,481
But. . .

1368
02:13:36,972 --> 02:13:40,488
The lady wants you. - Tell her she's coming.

1369
02:13:45,733 --> 02:13:46,721
Go, Suraiya.

1370
02:13:47,052 --> 02:13:52,207
Tell her the cupboards are full of clothes and jewellery.

1371
02:13:53,533 --> 02:13:59,210
Ask her to wear suitable clothes and jewellery for the occasion.

1372
02:14:00,012 --> 02:14:01,765
All right. - Go on.

1373
02:14:11,813 --> 02:14:15,248
Today's day is very auspicious. We got to see you today. . .

1374
02:14:15,613 --> 02:14:17,682
and it's also Suraiya's engagement today.

1375
02:14:18,012 --> 02:14:20,367
Now there will only be happiness in this house.

1376
02:14:22,012 --> 02:14:25,243
May the happiness of this house never depart.

1377
02:14:26,012 --> 02:14:31,484
Sister-in-law, I feel you are not my sister-in-law, but my mother.

1378
02:14:32,012 --> 02:14:34,845
Madam, the guests have arrived.

1379
02:14:41,372 --> 02:14:45,843
You are aware that Sharafat Ali is going to go abroad.

1380
02:14:46,813 --> 02:14:50,488
And quite often, our youngsters get carried away by foreign lifestyles.

1381
02:14:51,813 --> 02:14:53,849
You're right. - That is why I want him. . .

1382
02:14:54,212 --> 02:14:56,680
to get married by the end of this week. . .

1383
02:14:57,012 --> 02:14:59,731
so that he can take his wife along with him.

1384
02:15:00,212 --> 02:15:04,683
What do you say? - It makes no difference to me.

1385
02:15:05,012 --> 02:15:11,532
You can fix the marriage for next week, I have no problem.

1386
02:15:11,972 --> 02:15:15,010
May God bless you ! - Congratulations!

1387
02:15:31,012 --> 02:15:34,130
Sister-in-law, don't remove this jewellery.

1388
02:15:34,773 --> 02:15:36,650
Please don't, I beg of you.

1389
02:15:38,212 --> 02:15:40,646
I have no right to this jewellery or clothes.

1390
02:15:41,172 --> 02:15:43,686
They belong to the mistress of this house.

1391
02:15:45,012 --> 02:15:50,006
I'm destined to a life of darkness. When this darkness deepens. . .

1392
02:15:51,012 --> 02:15:56,292
a palanquin will come and take me away. . .

1393
02:15:56,693 --> 02:15:59,810
and I'll disappear into the darkness.

1394
02:16:00,212 --> 02:16:06,003
No, I won't let you leave. I swear I'll never let you go.

1395
02:16:06,853 --> 02:16:08,490
Brother!

1396
02:16:10,813 --> 02:16:15,681
Brother, she's preparing to leave. She's leaving, please stop her.

1397
02:16:16,052 --> 02:16:20,091
She won't stop. - At least try.

1398
02:16:20,573 --> 02:16:23,610
I'm sure she'll listen to you. - She won't.

1399
02:16:23,972 --> 02:16:28,728
She has fallen in love with me and this house. She will stay back.

1400
02:16:29,092 --> 02:16:31,653
Her love is not true, it's only a pretense.

1401
02:16:32,013 --> 02:16:37,007
No, there is no pretense in her eyes, there is honest love in them.

1402
02:16:37,852 --> 02:16:40,525
At least meet her once. - I can't.

1403
02:16:40,893 --> 02:16:43,646
I have promised she will return.

1404
02:16:44,013 --> 02:16:48,404
At least see her once, I'm sure you'll forget your promise.

1405
02:16:48,813 --> 02:16:52,248
No, Suraiya. - Please, or I'll kill myself.

1406
02:16:52,653 --> 02:16:55,690
Have you gone crazy? - Maybe, but come, please!

1407
02:17:01,173 --> 02:17:03,641
Come on ! - Wait! Listen to me!

1408
02:17:04,013 --> 02:17:09,610
I won't. Just try to stop her somehow, please.

1409
02:17:10,013 --> 02:17:11,412
Go on !

1410
02:17:18,852 --> 02:17:21,810
Forgive me, I shouldn't have come here.

1411
02:17:22,893 --> 02:17:24,884
But I was helpless before Suraiya's stubbornness.

1412
02:17:26,013 --> 02:17:30,245
My conscience will never forgive me for this crime.

1413
02:17:30,772 --> 02:17:35,243
Helplessness is not termed a crime. God sees one's intentions.

1414
02:17:36,893 --> 02:17:43,207
Thank God you have a soft heart and understand other people's helplessness

1415
02:17:45,493 --> 02:17:47,484
Even you are a soft hearted man.

1416
02:17:48,292 --> 02:17:52,172
Is it possible that you forgive me?

1417
02:17:53,212 --> 02:17:55,726
Forgive you? What for. . . ?

1418
02:18:03,093 --> 02:18:04,412
Zeenat?

1419
02:18:05,933 --> 02:18:07,730
Yes, Zeenat.

1420
02:18:08,612 --> 02:18:12,652
Are you the same Zeenat whom I wanted to give a life of love and respect?

1421
02:18:14,013 --> 02:18:18,609
Are you the Zeenat before whom I was proud to bow down in love?

1422
02:18:20,212 --> 02:18:26,481
And today, you had to come from the whore house in the cloak of darkness?

1423
02:18:28,013 --> 02:18:31,005
Yes, I'm that very Zeenat.

1424
02:18:32,013 --> 02:18:35,369
I wouldn't have coem here, but when I heard it was the question. . .

1425
02:18:35,772 --> 02:18:38,525
of an innocent girl's future, I couldn't hold myself back.

1426
02:18:39,253 --> 02:18:41,641
But how did all this happen?

1427
02:18:42,013 --> 02:18:46,006
How did you reach the whore house, instead of my mansion?

1428
02:18:46,813 --> 02:18:51,728
I didn't go there. Naziranbai gave me refuge. . .

1429
02:18:52,052 --> 02:18:57,332
and at such a time when everyone had rejected me.

1430
02:18:57,893 --> 02:19:00,009
But why did you play with my honour?

1431
02:19:01,013 --> 02:19:04,528
Tell me, why did the palanquin arrive here empty after our marriage?

1432
02:19:05,813 --> 02:19:07,804
If I was home at the time of marriage. . .

1433
02:19:08,052 --> 02:19:10,566
then I swear the palanquin wouldn't have arrived empty.

1434
02:19:11,772 --> 02:19:14,127
I don't understand.

1435
02:19:15,333 --> 02:19:20,487
We didn't get married. When the marriage formalities were on. . .

1436
02:19:21,013 --> 02:19:23,288
I was wandering in the mosque.

1437
02:19:24,173 --> 02:19:29,201
Suddenly, lightening struck and I don't know what happened after that.

1438
02:19:30,772 --> 02:19:34,003
When I recovered, I found myself in the whore house.

1439
02:19:35,813 --> 02:19:38,805
It was like a mother giving refuge to a child the world had rejected.

1440
02:19:41,493 --> 02:19:44,690
It's time for me to leave.

1441
02:19:49,093 --> 02:19:51,766
I have no right to stop you, but. . .

1442
02:19:52,132 --> 02:19:54,966
if you can, bring back happiness to this house.

1443
02:19:55,292 --> 02:19:58,329
This house and its people are still longing for you.

1444
02:19:58,813 --> 02:20:02,407
The land here still wants to welcome you.

1445
02:20:04,132 --> 02:20:08,172
I won't be able to give anything to this house.

1446
02:20:08,852 --> 02:20:12,003
I have nothing besides tears, sighs and sorrow.

1447
02:20:12,852 --> 02:20:16,367
And those too belong to someone else.

1448
02:20:55,893 --> 02:20:59,522
Suraiya, why are you here? - I'll go with you.

1449
02:21:00,013 --> 02:21:04,006
If you can't live with me, I'll live with you.

1450
02:21:04,933 --> 02:21:07,572
I'll go with you.

1451
02:21:08,813 --> 02:21:12,407
May God never take you where I'm going.

1452
02:21:12,813 --> 02:21:15,646
I'll go with you, no one can stop me.

1453
02:21:16,013 --> 02:21:19,210
I will ! Stupid girl, get up.

1454
02:21:21,013 --> 02:21:24,005
No one can return from where I live.

1455
02:21:43,933 --> 02:21:45,605
Sister-in-law. . . . - Sit down.

1456
02:21:47,972 --> 02:21:50,009
Why do you want to add to my problems?

1457
02:21:52,013 --> 02:21:56,609
You will have to tell me where you have come from and where you're going.

1458
02:21:57,013 --> 02:21:59,447
What is that darkness you want to disappear into?

1459
02:21:59,813 --> 02:22:03,248
What is the sorrow you have concealed in your heart?

1460
02:22:03,972 --> 02:22:09,252
I cannot reply your questions. Don't try to rake my wounds.

1461
02:22:10,013 --> 02:22:13,801
You sometimes laugh and cry sometimes.

1462
02:22:14,173 --> 02:22:18,485
You sometimes show love and sometimes hatred.

1463
02:22:19,493 --> 02:22:21,801
You even feel hurt leaving this house. . .

1464
02:22:22,173 --> 02:22:26,086
but you still want to leave. What mystery is this?

1465
02:22:27,212 --> 02:22:30,363
You won't understand this mystery. Go and sleep.

1466
02:22:30,772 --> 02:22:34,652
No, I'll not sleep. If I sleep, you'll go away.

1467
02:22:35,813 --> 02:22:41,648
I'll stay with you all night. And if you go, I'll go with you.

1468
02:22:42,093 --> 02:22:45,768
Whether darkness or light, I will. . . - You really have gone crazy!

1469
02:22:46,212 --> 02:22:49,488
Go and sleep. . . for my sake.

1470
02:23:04,013 --> 02:23:07,642
Sister-in-law. . . - Come, I'll put you to sleep.

1471
02:23:34,772 --> 02:23:39,004
''When people ask me questions. . . ''

1472
02:23:40,013 --> 02:23:43,483
''how am I to answer them?''

1473
02:23:44,493 --> 02:23:48,486
''You are so inconsiderate. . . ''

1474
02:23:49,292 --> 02:23:53,490
''how shall I answer them?''

1475
02:24:04,013 --> 02:24:12,011
''Should I be asked whom I have lost my heart to. . . ''

1476
02:24:23,212 --> 02:24:31,484
''how many people I have severed relations with. . . ''

1477
02:24:41,772 --> 02:24:45,481
''how shall I answer them?''

1478
02:25:11,493 --> 02:25:19,490
''Should I be asked who caused me pain in love. . . ''

1479
02:25:30,013 --> 02:25:38,489
''who is the one who has condemned me to sleepless nights. . . ''

1480
02:25:44,493 --> 02:25:49,487
''I'll have reservations in telling them. . . ''

1481
02:25:50,013 --> 02:25:53,483
''how shall I answer them?''

1482
02:25:54,333 --> 02:25:59,009
''You are so inconsiderate. . . ''

1483
02:25:59,413 --> 02:26:03,007
''how shall I answer them?''

1484
02:26:04,013 --> 02:26:08,006
''When people ask me questions. . . ''

1485
02:26:09,253 --> 02:26:12,484
''how shall I answer them?''

1486
02:26:30,573 --> 02:26:31,641
Sister-in-law. . . ?

1487
02:26:38,733 --> 02:26:42,407
You finally relented. You won't leave now, will you?

1488
02:26:51,813 --> 02:26:54,611
Where are you all? Prepare breakfast for sister-in-law.

1489
02:26:54,972 --> 02:26:59,012
No, I'll make it myself. I'll feed her myself today.

1490
02:27:00,893 --> 02:27:02,531
Did you hear that?

1491
02:27:07,013 --> 02:27:10,005
See how happy she is. Will you trample over her happiness and leave?

1492
02:27:11,132 --> 02:27:15,284
I can't live here forever. I'll have to leave one day.

1493
02:27:17,013 --> 02:27:20,847
You may go, because anyway Suraiya is here only for a few days more.

1494
02:27:22,013 --> 02:27:27,212
Send her off after her marriage. I won't stop you after that.

1495
02:27:29,933 --> 02:27:31,810
Just do this much.

1496
02:27:36,013 --> 02:27:37,365
As you wish.

1497
02:27:42,852 --> 02:27:43,841
Thank you.

1498
02:27:50,013 --> 02:27:53,722
Doctor, how is he? - There is nothing to worry about.

1499
02:27:54,052 --> 02:27:55,691
Thank God. - You sit down.

1500
02:27:56,013 --> 02:27:59,562
Can we meet him? - Yes, but one at a time.

1501
02:28:00,212 --> 02:28:04,444
You can't meet him. Seeing you, he'll consume poison again.

1502
02:28:04,813 --> 02:28:06,405
Sit here! I'll go meet him.

1503
02:28:11,212 --> 02:28:13,567
Yusuf, it's Aachchan.

1504
02:28:16,772 --> 02:28:23,484
Why did you save me? It was better if I had died.

1505
02:28:24,013 --> 02:28:27,688
Don't talk nonsense. Zeenat is more brave than you.

1506
02:28:28,013 --> 02:28:31,642
Don't talk about that betrayer. - Don't call her a betrayer.

1507
02:28:32,013 --> 02:28:36,643
Even she was cheated. She longed for you till the very end.

1508
02:28:37,013 --> 02:28:39,004
This bangle proves it.

1509
02:28:40,212 --> 02:28:43,171
Bangle? What bangle?

1510
02:28:43,772 --> 02:28:47,208
It's Zeenat's bangle which somehow got into the hands of your uncle.

1511
02:28:47,852 --> 02:28:52,721
Even after marriage, she came to your house to meet you.

1512
02:28:53,132 --> 02:28:57,923
Damn your uncle, he told her you were a loafer and a womaniser. . .

1513
02:28:58,292 --> 02:29:01,602
and heart-broken, she went away.

1514
02:29:04,013 --> 02:29:06,368
Aachchan, you have bought me hope.

1515
02:29:07,212 --> 02:29:10,727
By proving Zeenat to be faithful, you have given me new life.

1516
02:29:12,893 --> 02:29:15,009
Now I will be able to live with her memories.

1517
02:29:17,852 --> 02:29:21,527
But the way I thought her to be unfaithful. . .

1518
02:29:21,933 --> 02:29:23,764
even she must think the same about me.

1519
02:29:24,052 --> 02:29:28,251
I just want to meet her once and clear her misunderstanding.

1520
02:29:28,813 --> 02:29:30,849
Will I be able to meet her?

1521
02:29:31,212 --> 02:29:37,481
Get well first. Life will somehow bring you face to face one day.

1522
02:29:37,972 --> 02:29:42,648
Clear her misunderstanding then. - Now I'll only live for that day.

1523
02:29:46,573 --> 02:29:50,771
I have lost Zeenat, but not her love.

1524
02:29:51,972 --> 02:29:56,727
She is mine, and will always remain so.

1525
02:29:58,933 --> 02:30:00,002
She's mine.

1526
02:30:10,013 --> 02:30:14,643
Where is my sister-in-law? - Don't worry, I'm here.

1527
02:30:15,212 --> 02:30:19,649
Stay with me, I'm feeling very nervous.

1528
02:30:20,532 --> 02:30:24,002
Everyone feels nervous while getting married.

1529
02:30:26,692 --> 02:30:29,126
Will this house no more be mine?

1530
02:30:30,093 --> 02:30:35,486
There is a very short distance between one's maternal and marital home.

1531
02:30:36,813 --> 02:30:40,362
But this short distance changes one's course of life.

1532
02:31:04,013 --> 02:31:05,002
Brother!

1533
02:31:10,013 --> 02:31:14,643
Why do you cry? Maternal home is never a girl's real home.

1534
02:31:16,013 --> 02:31:19,642
You should feel happy you're going to your own house today.

1535
02:31:22,013 --> 02:31:26,803
Just remember, you were one family's honour. . .

1536
02:31:27,772 --> 02:31:30,809
now you're responsible for the honour of two families. Go on, my child.

1537
02:31:32,052 --> 02:31:33,201
Go on.

1538
02:32:02,813 --> 02:32:05,406
Sister-in-law. . . - Don't worry. . .

1539
02:32:05,972 --> 02:32:09,602
until your palanquin leaves, I won't leave your hand.

1540
02:32:55,013 --> 02:32:57,891
Why are you still sitting here? The palanquin has left.

1541
02:33:33,132 --> 02:33:37,172
What are you waiting for? The palanquin has left.

1542
02:33:38,013 --> 02:33:41,972
Yes Zeenat, the palanquin has left.

1543
02:33:43,813 --> 02:33:46,406
But thank God it didn't go empty.

1544
02:33:49,013 --> 02:33:51,163
Palanquins never go empty.

1545
02:33:52,013 --> 02:33:56,006
Some carry the bride, and some a bride's shattered dreams.

1546
02:33:57,013 --> 02:33:59,083
Even I would have sacrificed myself for my father's honour. . .

1547
02:33:59,413 --> 02:34:01,404
but destiny never gave me a chance.

1548
02:34:03,013 --> 02:34:08,371
Nothing is lost yet. Our honour is still intact.

1549
02:34:09,013 --> 02:34:12,722
If you can't return love for love. . .

1550
02:34:13,093 --> 02:34:15,731
then at least keep this family's honour for humanity sake.

1551
02:34:16,052 --> 02:34:19,011
Don't leave this house, that's my request to you.

1552
02:34:20,733 --> 02:34:24,726
I'm in a dilemma, give me time to think.

1553
02:34:25,173 --> 02:34:27,243
Please give me time to think.

1554
02:34:37,972 --> 02:34:40,646
Oh God, what should I do?

1555
02:34:42,813 --> 02:34:45,007
Your self-respecting father threw you out of the house.

1556
02:34:45,813 --> 02:34:48,805
The one for whom you gave up your family honour, betrayed you.

1557
02:34:49,733 --> 02:34:52,691
This decent house is much better than that whore house.

1558
02:34:53,852 --> 02:34:55,570
Accept Sikander Mirza's offer.

1559
02:34:55,852 --> 02:34:59,640
Save this decent man's honour, stay in this house.

1560
02:35:00,013 --> 02:35:03,005
Yes, that's what I'll do.

1561
02:35:03,493 --> 02:35:07,486
''I shall wait for you. . . ''

1562
02:35:08,013 --> 02:35:15,488
''I shall wait for you till the end of Time''

1563
02:35:16,573 --> 02:35:20,486
''May God bring about such a day. . . ''

1564
02:35:21,413 --> 02:35:24,485
''that heralds your arrival''

1565
02:35:33,212 --> 02:35:37,001
''I shall wait for you''

1566
02:35:46,013 --> 02:35:53,488
''You are the one my dejected eyes look for''

1567
02:35:54,493 --> 02:36:01,489
''I wander in the quest of meeting you''

1568
02:36:03,013 --> 02:36:07,484
''May I carry on with the same passion and obsession. . . ''

1569
02:36:14,013 --> 02:36:17,005
''for you to arrive''

1570
02:36:17,813 --> 02:36:21,487
''May God bring Time to an end. . . ''

1571
02:36:22,013 --> 02:36:25,005
''to herald your arrival''

1572
02:36:26,013 --> 02:36:29,005
''I shall wait for you''

1573
02:36:38,813 --> 02:36:46,493
''I shall lay my life at your feet''

1574
02:36:47,013 --> 02:36:54,488
''I shall entrust to you what is rightfully yours''

1575
02:37:02,013 --> 02:37:06,006
''Just when I'm about to leave. . . ''

1576
02:37:06,493 --> 02:37:09,485
''I wish you could arrive''

1577
02:37:10,493 --> 02:37:14,486
''May God bring Time to an end. . . ''

1578
02:37:15,013 --> 02:37:18,483
''to bring about your arrival''

1579
02:37:19,013 --> 02:37:22,483
''I shall wait for you''

1580
02:37:24,653 --> 02:37:29,727
Why have you returned now, after maligning me?

1581
02:37:30,132 --> 02:37:32,088
To prove my innocence.

1582
02:37:33,052 --> 02:37:37,012
To tell you that you misunderstood me. I'm not at fault.

1583
02:37:37,852 --> 02:37:41,606
Not at fault? You made a living corpse out of my father.

1584
02:37:42,013 --> 02:37:44,573
I lost my home and my honour, because of you.

1585
02:37:44,933 --> 02:37:47,163
You tarnished a decent man's reputation,. . .

1586
02:37:47,532 --> 02:37:49,363
yet you say you're not at fault?

1587
02:37:50,013 --> 02:37:54,245
I have cursed you with every tear I have shed.

1588
02:37:54,653 --> 02:37:56,484
God will never forgive you.

1589
02:37:56,893 --> 02:38:01,727
First hear me out Zeenat, then you can say what you like.

1590
02:38:03,013 --> 02:38:07,847
I swear to God, I was not at fault for all that happened.

1591
02:38:08,813 --> 02:38:11,805
I thought you to be unfaithful, and you thought the same about me.

1592
02:38:12,253 --> 02:38:16,007
But it was my uncle who was the culprit.

1593
02:38:16,333 --> 02:38:20,485
You have cheated me once, you can't cheat me again.

1594
02:38:21,013 --> 02:38:25,484
No Zeenat, that cruel monster has ruined our lives.

1595
02:38:25,893 --> 02:38:27,804
Your marriage was finalised with Sikander Mirza.

1596
02:38:28,132 --> 02:38:30,010
But he kept telling me it was fixed with me.

1597
02:38:30,292 --> 02:38:32,806
He sent me off to Allahabad.

1598
02:38:33,292 --> 02:38:37,081
And on the night of your marriage, when you came looking for me. . .

1599
02:38:37,493 --> 02:38:40,485
he told you I was a womaniser and broke your heart too.

1600
02:38:41,013 --> 02:38:43,686
Just to usurp my property. . .

1601
02:38:44,013 --> 02:38:47,369
he left me to a lifetime of tears and sorrow.

1602
02:38:47,972 --> 02:38:50,611
Is this all true?

1603
02:38:51,013 --> 02:38:53,004
What will I gain from lying now?

1604
02:38:54,013 --> 02:38:56,402
I've only come to clear your misunderstanding.

1605
02:38:56,972 --> 02:39:01,727
And to return this.

1606
02:39:05,173 --> 02:39:09,689
May God bless you both.

1607
02:39:12,852 --> 02:39:17,004
Just say once that you don't think I betrayed you.

1608
02:39:17,933 --> 02:39:20,606
I'll leave and never come back.

1609
02:39:22,733 --> 02:39:26,009
Lord ! How could all this happen?

1610
02:39:29,013 --> 02:39:31,686
Tell me Yusuf, what should I do?

1611
02:39:32,173 --> 02:39:38,009
What a decent wife would do.

1612
02:39:39,813 --> 02:39:44,011
But I am not his wife, I'm not married to him.

1613
02:39:46,173 --> 02:39:47,891
What are you saying?

1614
02:39:48,813 --> 02:39:51,121
When the marriage formalities were on. . .

1615
02:39:51,813 --> 02:39:54,691
I was looking for you at the mosque.

1616
02:39:55,612 --> 02:40:00,208
The palanquin left empty from my father's house.

1617
02:40:00,733 --> 02:40:04,202
Then how come you are here?

1618
02:40:05,852 --> 02:40:07,808
That's a sad story.

1619
02:40:08,813 --> 02:40:11,646
Despite not being his wife. . .

1620
02:40:12,013 --> 02:40:15,244
I'm pretending to be the Nawab's wife to save his honour.

1621
02:40:15,733 --> 02:40:18,121
In that case, come right now with me.

1622
02:40:18,813 --> 02:40:20,804
I can't live a moment without you.

1623
02:40:21,253 --> 02:40:25,724
I have found my lost love, I can't leave you now.

1624
02:40:26,093 --> 02:40:28,686
Come Zeenat, come with me now.

1625
02:40:29,212 --> 02:40:36,288
How can I ? The Nawab's decency has tied me down.

1626
02:40:37,013 --> 02:40:40,722
I cannot trample over his family's honour and leave.

1627
02:40:42,733 --> 02:40:47,011
Forget about Zeenat, she is dead for you.

1628
02:40:48,013 --> 02:40:53,645
I have decided, I'll keep your memories close to heart. . .

1629
02:40:54,013 --> 02:40:56,083
and stifle all my desires.

1630
02:40:57,452 --> 02:41:04,484
I'll give up all my happiness to be a decent wife.

1631
02:41:05,173 --> 02:41:08,290
But I shall not defile the honour of this house.

1632
02:41:08,893 --> 02:41:11,486
I'll sacrifice myself for the Nawab's honour.

1633
02:41:12,013 --> 02:41:16,484
Why should you sacrifice yourself? I'll sacrifice myself.

1634
02:41:24,972 --> 02:41:27,327
Oh my God, he's heard everything.

1635
02:41:32,772 --> 02:41:36,731
I'll sacrifice my life, but won't let you die.

1636
02:41:44,813 --> 02:41:49,011
Let me go. The Nawab has heard everything, God knows what he'll do.

1637
02:41:53,173 --> 02:41:54,686
Don't stop me.

1638
02:41:55,013 --> 02:41:59,211
Think again. Your decision will ruin our lives.

1639
02:42:04,333 --> 02:42:06,721
Don't be crazy. Don't torch yourself alive.

1640
02:42:07,052 --> 02:42:09,009
Fire!

1641
02:42:16,013 --> 02:42:18,402
What are you doing? Come with me.

1642
02:42:25,173 --> 02:42:28,404
Yusuf, for God's sake, save the Nawab.

1643
02:42:29,093 --> 02:42:32,369
You wait here, I'll try my best to save him.

1644
02:42:32,772 --> 02:42:36,003
But you don't come towards the house! I beg of you, please don't!

1645
02:42:59,333 --> 02:43:01,721
What have you done, Nawab?

1646
02:43:51,852 --> 02:43:56,846
The Nawab, his wife, there is no trace of either.

1647
02:43:58,013 --> 02:44:02,484
I think both perished in the fire.

1648
02:44:03,972 --> 02:44:06,486
God knows how the fire started.

1649
02:44:06,972 --> 02:44:09,088
What is destined to happen, will happen.

1650
02:44:09,813 --> 02:44:13,692
The sad part is that, with the Nawab's death. . .

1651
02:44:14,013 --> 02:44:17,005
a beautiful era of Lucknow has come to an end.

1652
02:44:23,972 --> 02:44:25,963
The Nawab had heard your decision.

1653
02:44:28,173 --> 02:44:30,004
And this is his decision.

1654
02:44:32,052 --> 02:44:34,009
He got out of love's way.

1655
02:44:35,813 --> 02:44:38,486
What was to have happened to the Nawab, happened.

1656
02:44:40,013 --> 02:44:44,245
But in these ruins, this mansion's mistress' name will always echo.

1657
02:44:46,733 --> 02:44:48,802
We'll have to leave Lucknow,. . .

1658
02:44:50,093 --> 02:44:55,804
so that the Nawab and his mansion's honour remains intact.

1659
02:44:58,212 --> 02:44:59,406
Come, Zeenat.
