00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:17,546
What's the price?

00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,482
Rs.17 a kilo.

3
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,580
Give me a fair price.

4
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:24,213
How much you want?
- Both of us want to buy.

5
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:25,722
So, give us a fair price.

I want a kilo.

00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:31,223
I will give it to you for Rs.10.

8
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:42,434
Chill.
- Do you also want?

9
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:45,602
Which story do I tell you now?
Which one?

10
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,509
How much for that?

11
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:48,375
Rs. 50.

12
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:50,745
Give me a quarter kilo of that.
- How about half a kilo?

13
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:55,082
No, no, no, just give me a quarter kilo.
Come on hurry

00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:55,813
Give it.

15
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:58,045
Anything else?
- No. This is enough.

16
00:02:58,278 --> 00:02:59,279
Take this.

17
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,588
Come on.

18
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:02,149
Shall we?

19
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:06,556
Careful! Careful! Careful!

20
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,325
Come.

21
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:13,603
Wait.

22
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:17,100
And..

23
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:19,642

00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:29,378
Come. Come. Come.

00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,781
Come on. Sit in the front.

27
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:33,552
Come back.

28
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:38,795
Carefully.

29
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:41,194
Hey. Who are you?

30
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:44,701
How dare you get into the car!
Get out... please.

31
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:46,393
Help!

00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,139

00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:57,441
Shut up. You'll be fine.

36
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:59,279
Faster. Faster.

37
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:01,512
Hey..
- I said shut up.

38
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:02,986
My kid

39
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:04,249
Sit down.

40
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:06,313
How dare you hit him? Let go.

41
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,222
Let him go. I want my son.

42
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:09,419
Robin.

43
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:12,362
Let us go...please...

44
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:22,771
Faster! Faster! Faster!

45
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:30,641
Mom!

46
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:32,777
Mom!

47
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,280
Mom!

48
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:35,376
Robin.
- Mom!

49
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,285
Ah.. Robin.

50
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,521
Robin.
- Shut up!

51
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,025
He will fall down.

52
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:43,186
Robin!

53
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:45,094
Robin!

54
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:46,654
Stop the car!
Stop the car!

55
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,028
Stop the car!
Stop the car!

56
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:50,091
Stop the car!
Stop the car!

57
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:51,727
Stop the car!
Stop the car!

58
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,738
My kid has fallen.
Stop the car!

59
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:56,140
Stop the car!

60
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,671
I think she's dead.
- Don't worry. - What are you doing?

61
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:07,082
Take the gun.
Put it in the same bag with the money.

62
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,609
Get out when I tell you to.

63
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:10,750
Slow down! Slow down!

64
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,752
Not this way.
That way.

65
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,981
When I say. Okay?

66
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:20,996
Jump! G0!

67
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:00,966
I didn't do anything, sir.
lam just the driver.

68
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:02,029
The other guy did all this.
He escaped.

69
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:03,506
Take him away.

70
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,073
Take him.

71
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,200
Lock him up.

72
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,012
Call an ambulance!

73
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:16,746
"O crazy guys, recognize me."

74
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:20,186
"O crazy guys, recognize me."

75
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:22,284
"Oh.. yeah.."

76
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:25,987
"Who am l?"

77
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:31,497
"O crazy guys, recognize me."

78
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:32,730
"Oh.. yeah.."

79
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:39,405
"O crazy guys, recognize me."

80
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:40,604
"Oh.. yeah.."

81
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,013
Superb.

82
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:48,080
Okay, okay.
Now out with the truth. How was it?

83
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,678
How was it?
I think it's a fabulous idea.

84
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,382
Superb.
- I hope the boss finds it fabulous too.

85
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,584
You know how he is.
"O Raghu..."

86
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:57,458
You are sassing me.

87
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:58,495
Where did you copy this from?

88
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,030
Hey...it's original.

89
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:03,963
She's going to live for a 100 years.

90
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:05,968
Yeah, baby!

91
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,136
Where's the emergency ward?
- Sir...Sir..

92
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:13,302
Mr. Raghu.
- Yes.

93
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:15,573
Your wife's in room no. 320.
- Thank you.

94
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:23,249
Sir, I received a phone call..

95
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,051
..saying that my wife
Misha met with an accident. - Please, come.

96
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:25,987
It wasn't an accident.

97
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:28,453
It's a robbery case.

98
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:29,720
She was shot.

99
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:32,122
The patient is critical,
you need to come this way.

100
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,734
Misha.

101
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:43,733
Misha.

102
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:56,448
Where is Robin?

103
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:57,647
Misha.

104
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:00,514
You'll be okay, baby.

105
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:02,525
Everything will be fine.

106
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:06,962
L...l can't see anything.

107
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,326
I can't see you.

108
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:11,596
lam right here, Misha.
- Where are you?

109
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,160
Right here. I am here.

110
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:13,704
Where?

111
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:15,300
Here, baby.

112
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:16,299
I am scared.

113
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:17,603
Misha, I am here.

114
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:18,665
Misha.

115
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:19,369
Misha.

116
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:20,502
Raghu..

117
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:22,545
'An-...

118
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:26,250
I can't see anything.

119
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:27,751
Please".

120
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,749
Misha, I am here.
- Raghu.

121
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:32,115
Relax. - Raghu.
- Misha.

122
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:33,719
Misha.

123
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:37,491
Misha.

124
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:39,987
Misha.

125
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:41,994
Misha?

126
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:46,034
Can you.. Can you call the doctor?

127
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:50,366
Can you call the doc..

128
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:58,213
Pulse absent.

129
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:07,483
My son Robin, where is he?

130
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,456
It's a murder case now.

131
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:17,968
I told him not to carry a gun.

132
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:20,095
He said it was not loaded.
He said just do your job. Drive.

133
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,503
Who? Who is your accomplice?

134
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,563
Jayu! His name's Jayu. Jayant!

135
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,540
Jayant?
- Yes.

136
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:26,599
Everyone calls him Jayu.
- Where does he live?

137
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,236
He lives in Yerwada.
- Huh!

138
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:29,644
Close to Gunjan Talkies.

139
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:30,613
What the..

140
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,651
Close to the Xerox...
He lives close to the Xerox-shop.

141
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:35,050
I see.

142
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:38,988
How long have you known him?
- Since 3 weeks, sir.

143
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:41,185
That is it.
I wanted a job.

144
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,557
He said he could get me
a job in the Middle East!

145
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:46,597
On one condition.... First
I had to help him do this robbery.

146
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,728
I didn't know he had a loaded gun.
-Who fired the gun?

147
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,236
I was driving, sir.
- Huh! You were driving?

148
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:55,000
So who fired the gun?
-He did.

149
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:56,268
lsee?
- Yes.

150
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:59,208
I was driving.
-I am just a driver.

151
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:00,242
I see.

152
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,008
He was supposed
to get me a job in the Gulf.

153
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:06,116
I didn't know it was loaded.
I didn't know.

154
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:08,047
Sir...they're showing it on TV.

155
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,195
How long?
Well, the Police are doing their job.

156
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:20,390
We are on the job.

157
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,761
Catching the criminal,
and we're doing that.

158
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:24,023
We'll inform you as soon as
we get any information. Okay.

159
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,434
Are you hiding anything?
- Sir..

160
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,012
Raghu.

161
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,222
Extremely sorry, son.

162
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:24,558
The cremation is tomorrow at 4 pm.

163
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,384
That's a lot of kidney beans.

164
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,079
Are you planning
to serve this all week?

165
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:27,090
It's Chilli-Corn Carne...Mexican.

166
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:31,393
Robbie, come eat your dinner quickly.

167
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:34,021
You still have to finish
your homework, don't you? Come.

168
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,163
I will either eat...or do my homework.

169
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:38,224
Get off that Casio right away.

170
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,395
Come.

171
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,663
Come here.

172
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:48,035
If you eat this, I'll take
you to the dentist on Saturday.

173
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,377
And if you don't,
then I'll take you to the movies.

174
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,346
Understood?

175
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:52,576
No, I didn't.

176
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,812
Mom, what's papa saying?

177
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,214
I wish I understood, son.

178
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:00,353
How is it?
- Very nice.

179
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,753
Scrumplicious

180
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:04,518
I made a little too much.

181
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:06,222
If you love me you'll eat it all week!

182
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:44,023
Did you find him, sir?

183
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,466
He killed them,
and ran away with the loot...

184
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:49,700
..why are you hitting me?.

185
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:53,176
Give me two clays, I'll find him.

186
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,078
I heard him talking to some girl.

187
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:55,737
Kalpana!

188
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:58,109
He called up Kalpana.

189
00:13:58,538 --> 00:13:59,778
She was a tall girl.

190
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,040
Typist."...

191
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,023
Can I get some weed?

192
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:08,488
It helps me think better.

193
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:09,993
You want weed?

194
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:45,090
Son, why don't you
come back with us to Delhi?

195
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:46,657
Come stay with us.

196
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,494
We'll take care of you...

197
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,535
And this place...

198
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:53,330
I mean...there's no rush.

199
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:56,237
You can take your time. Yeah!

200
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:59,403
Yes, son. Papa's right.

201
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:02,309
Come with us to Delhi.
Drink some juice.

202
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:07,517
Look, Raghu. Your in-laws
aren't eating anything either.

203
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:10,684
Listen...rush to the supermarket..

204
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,552
..and get some South
Indian instant food packets.

205
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:14,990
I'll cook them a curry..
- Have you lost your mind?

206
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:16,357
You're thinking about
food at this time.

207
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,723
But they are not eating anything.

208
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:20,464
But..
- I am not like you...

209
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,999
to hide behind the newspaper.

210
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:23,659
Who's hiding behind the newspaper?
- Be quiet.

211
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:25,225
Son, drink some juice.

212
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:26,367
Raghu...

213
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:48,289
Last night we called our artist..

214
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,520
..to make a sketch of his partner.

215
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:53,725
And the result was this.

216
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:56,394
Do you know who he is?

217
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,097
Ranjeet! The actor!

218
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,206
He's taking us for a ride.

219
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:04,536
Sir, can I meet him?

220
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,126
I know how you are feeling Sir...

221
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,688
I can feel your pain.

222
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:29,495
I can feel your pain.

223
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:31,364
What happened was terrible.

224
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:36,997
Jayu shot her,
I already told the inspector.

225
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,534
Jayu!

226
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:42,740
Can I have a minute with him?

227
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,208
May I?

228
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:47,284
I think they bumped off Jayu.

229
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:49,484
And took the entire loot.

230
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:52,214
I don't trust these cops.

231
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:57,159
Maybe they split the loot 50-50.

232
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:58,718
Honestly.

233
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:00,962
I didn't shoot her.

234
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,689
You rogue.

235
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,628
You were there too.

236
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:09,968
Hold him!

237
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:13,139
Why did you kill her?
- Leave him.

238
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:17,980
Let go off.

239
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:19,574
It was you.

240
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:22,543
You're the culprit.
You rogue.

241
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:25,018
Stop, Raghu!

242
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:27,990
Have you lost your mind?
You want to kill him?

243
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,492
I will lose my job because of you.

244
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:30,584
Take him away.

245
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:33,594
Take him away.

246
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:35,530
What are you staring at?

247
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:49,710
Raghu!

248
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:51,742
The phone's ringing?

249
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:53,608
Nobody's picking up.

250
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,548
Nobody's picking up the phone.

251
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:58,145
Maybe he's not home.

252
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:19,066
ls Mr. Joshi at home?
- Come in.

253
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,508
Sit.

254
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,623
R Joshi, private detective.
That's me.

255
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:37,255
Sorry. I didn't attend
my yoga class today.

256
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:39,159
This is the best exercise,
to keep fit.

257
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:40,196
Come in.

258
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:42,164
lam sorry about your family..

259
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:46,727
The cops couldn't get the accomplice
in all these days...you think I can?

260
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:28,709
Hey...want a drink?

261
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:31,180

Where's the loot?
Who has it?

00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:44,350
Will you speak up...
or do we make you the local Draupadi?

269
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,726
You didn't get it? Explain it to him.

270
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:52,389
Come on.

271
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,529

Where is the loot?

276
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:14,011
Can I get a drink?

277
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,515
She wants a drink eh?

278
00:21:17,343 --> 00:21:18,617

Check the bag.

281
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:44,678
You can go in.

282
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:46,141
Next.

283
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:54,483
You good for nothing!

284
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:05,331
Tell me.

285
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:06,995
Shame on you... You haven't
stopped your antics in here too.

286
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:08,663
How did you get hurt? Speak up.

287
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:11,298
Are you clone?
Have you brought my clothes?

288
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:13,434
I did. It's outside.

289
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:16,769
How long are they going
to keep you here?

290
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:21,041
I don't know how long.
I haven't clone anything.

291
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:24,349
Are you guilty of killing
that woman and child?

292
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:27,014
I said it a thousand times.
I haven't clone anything.

293
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,787
I didn't kill them.
- Swear on me.

294
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,689
You think they'll free me if I do?

295
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:34,025
Go back to the shop.

296
00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:46,401
Hello...excuse me.

297
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:52,078
Are you heading towards the station?
- Yes.

298
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:53,716
Can we go together?

299
00:22:53,773 --> 00:22:55,650
We can share the fare.

300
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:58,113
Okay.
- Yes.

301
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:00,521
Please".

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,624
I own a tea shop myself.
- I see.

303
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:06,992
What are you doing here?

304
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:11,291
My sister-in-law framed my brother.

305
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,728
I swear my brother's a noble man.

306
00:23:14,994 --> 00:23:16,564
He's been sentenced for 5 years..

307
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:20,076
I swear he hasn't clone anything.
- It's okay.

308
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:26,047
What are you doing here?
- My son..

309
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:29,213
Good for nothing guy

00:23:29,275 --> 00:23:31,721
wants to marry a w***e...

311
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:33,347
A Wm”,

312
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:36,118
What is your
daughter-in-law's business?

313
00:23:38,017 --> 00:23:41,055
You are a woman, you should know
what business she will be having.

314
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,789
Where did he find this awful girl?

315
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,067
Real name Jhimli.

316
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,332
Professional name...Shabnum.

317
00:23:49,328 --> 00:23:51,604
She charges 5000 for 2 hours.

318
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:54,040
And I charge 2000 for 24 hours.
How about that?

319
00:23:56,702 --> 00:23:59,046
Liak and she were
born in the same village.

320
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,640
Grew up in the same neighborhood.

321
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:03,209
Childhood friends.
Liak is crazy about her.

322
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:05,655
She operates from Mumbai.

323
00:24:05,711 --> 00:24:09,625
There's a Shagun Beauty Parlor
near Regal Cinema.

324
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,220
Ask for Mukesh aka ‘Mamu’.

325
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,763
He's the pimp.

326
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:16,021
I want to meet Shabnam.
- 10,000 for 2 hours.

327
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:18,193
Get to this address by 8.

328
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:21,329
I've sent a freshie.
Charged him double.

329
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,604
Strip him clean.

330
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:36,609
"My youth glitters like gold,
sweetheart."

331
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,280
First time?

332
00:24:39,345 --> 00:24:44,761
"The world's crazy
about my silky body."

333
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:50,665
"Is it my fault, sweetheart?"

334
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:54,671
"Is it my fault, sweetheart?"

335
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:58,800
"..that I blossomed
at such a tender age."

336
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:18,689
"The world weighed
my beauty with pearls."

337
00:25:18,751 --> 00:25:23,063
"They made many excuses to cajole me."

338
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:27,036
"The world weighed
my beauty with pearls."

339
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:30,699
"They made excuses to entice me."

340
00:25:30,763 --> 00:25:32,242
Can I tie you up?

341
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:35,744
"I've many fans."

342
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:37,139
Like in the English movies, huh?

343
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,307
"I've many fans."

344
00:25:39,505 --> 00:25:42,384
It will cost you 2000 extra.
- Okay.

345
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,024
Hey...

346
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:52,629
Extra for tearing up my dress.

347
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:54,223
Okay.

348
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:57,330
They are expensive, not the cheap
stuff one gets on Fashion Street.

349
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:59,469
My top's worth 4000.

350
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:03,701
How much do you make in a clay, Jhimli?

351
00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:07,409
Who are you?

352
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:09,405
How do you know my name?

353
00:26:09,468 --> 00:26:11,072
What is Liak's partner's name?

354
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:12,206
Liak who?

355
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:14,742
Your boyfriend.

356
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:16,350
I don't have a boyfriend.

357
00:26:16,442 --> 00:26:17,512
Everyone here is my boyfriend.

358
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,749
Untie me or I will scream.
- Scream!

359
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:22,014
Call the police.

360
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:27,559
Who are you?

361
00:26:28,721 --> 00:26:30,098
Who are you?

362
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:34,661
I am the one whose wife
and kid died in the bank that clay.

363
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:38,297
Sir...

364
00:26:39,732 --> 00:26:41,143
Sir...forgive me.

365
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,012
I'll tell you.
I'll tell you everything.

366
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:47,312
I know Liak.

367
00:26:47,373 --> 00:26:49,444
He's a friend...for many years.

368
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:51,351
He loves me too.

369
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:53,680
But he didn't like me working here.

370
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:56,555
No one does this job willingly.

371
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:57,719
But I was helpless.

372
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,529
2 months ago Liak paid a visit.

373
00:27:01,587 --> 00:27:03,294
He said he'll get me out of here.

374
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,966
And two clays later I saw on TV..

375
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,638
He's a fraudster and thief....

376
00:27:10,696 --> 00:27:12,607
...but he's no murderer.

377
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:13,699
Sir..

378
00:27:25,611 --> 00:27:29,081
I got 3.5 million on
my son's life-insurance.

379
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:31,290
You can take it all.

380
00:27:32,051 --> 00:27:34,258
Just tell me who Liak's partner is.

381
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,568
Warshid Akhtar.

382
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:43,303
Liak Mohammed.

383
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:46,007
Anand Kamble.

384
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:50,742
You?

385
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:52,511
What have you clone?

386
00:27:52,638 --> 00:27:54,481
I didn't kill them.

387
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,077
I'm tired of telling everyone.
But no one's ready to listen.

388
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:59,019
If you didn't kill them,
then why are you protecting him?

389
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:02,184
Become an approver.
You'll face lesser sentence.

390
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:04,693
I am ready,
but where will I find him.

391
00:28:05,484 --> 00:28:08,328
The Police have killed him
and kept the loot.

392
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,297
Forget it,
say something dirty. Come on.

393
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:11,129
What?

394
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:15,297
You know...
these clays I talk to you a lot

395
00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:18,034
I speak your lines too.
-Which lines?

396
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:21,009
The noises you make....
Please, no! Please, no!

397
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:22,477
Please, no!
- Are you crazy?

398
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,707
You're in jail.
- Come on.

399
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,072
Do it.

400
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:28,209
Just once.

401
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:29,684
Raghav visited me yesterday.

402
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,017
He knows my name.

403
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,615
How did he find you?

404
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:37,526
He was asking
for your partner's name.

405
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:39,987
He said he'll pay me.

406
00:28:40,986 --> 00:28:43,091
Otherwise he was threatening
to go to the police.

407
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:44,998
Hmm..

408
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,039
So what will you do now?

409
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:53,668
He said he same things
he told the police.

410
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:56,010
He didn't say anything more.

411
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:57,172
I am sorry.

412
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:58,772
Did you tell him about me?

413
00:28:59,004 --> 00:29:00,312
Why would I tell him about you?

414
00:29:00,372 --> 00:29:03,114
I just asked him generally.

415
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:04,954
Did he say anything else?

416
00:29:04,977 --> 00:29:07,014
He just kept staring
at me for a while.

417
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:09,951
He was happy to see me.

418
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:14,189
You're happy too?

419
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:16,960
Were you haPPV?

420
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:21,103
Look...l went there
because you asked me to.

421
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:23,738
And I don't think he's clone anything.

422
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:25,134
The poor guy's is innocent.
Trapped.

423
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:26,733
And he won't lie to me.

424
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:29,570
Don't waste your time and money.

425
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:33,106
And cough up my money too.

426
00:29:33,739 --> 00:29:35,980
I've to pay commission
to Mukesh as well.

427
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:37,645
And so many other expenses too.

428
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:44,554
Thank you.

429
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,254
Thank you.

430
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:06,047
"My youth glitters like gold,
sweetheart."

431
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:07,583
You please everyone, don't you?

432
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,013
Now please me.

433
00:30:11,777 --> 00:30:18,092
"World is crazy after my beauty."

434
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:24,196
"What's my mistake, sweetheart?"

435
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:26,566
"What's my mistake, sweetheart?"

436
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:28,366
What are you thinking? Dance.

437
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:32,169
"I turned young at such a tender age."

438
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,543
ls this how you dance for Liak?

439
00:30:40,606 --> 00:30:46,284
"My youth glitters like gold,
sweetheart."

440
00:31:04,129 --> 00:31:08,544
"The world weighed
my beauty with pearls."

441
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,605
"They made many excuses to cajole me."

442
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:16,517
"The world weighed
my beauty with pearls."

443
00:31:16,575 --> 00:31:20,523
"They made excuses to entice me."

444
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:25,289
"lam like a bud...and
many bees are after me.."

445
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:39,304
Next time you meet Liak,
tell him about me!

446
00:31:40,132 --> 00:31:43,341
The Court sentences Liak
to 20 years imprisonment..

447
00:31:43,602 --> 00:31:46,242
..for loot and murder!

448
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:47,749
Don't worry.

449
00:31:47,806 --> 00:31:49,342
I'll do something.
- Move.

450
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,149
I'll come see you.

451
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:52,449
Liak.

452
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:53,615
Liak.

453
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,818
Come on, move.. move..

454
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:00,187
How many times do I tell you?

455
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:01,754
Move.

456
00:32:03,722 --> 00:32:05,724
Any message for Jhimli?

457
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:08,126
Come on!

458
00:32:08,627 --> 00:32:10,231
Don't go ahead.
- Sir.. sir..

459
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:11,603
What did you say?

460
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:12,539
Back.

461
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:16,671
Go back.

462
00:32:16,735 --> 00:32:18,442
Keep him back.

463
00:32:19,538 --> 00:32:20,744
Get inside.

464
00:32:21,573 --> 00:32:22,449
Move.. move away.

465
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:24,248
Mr. Raghav,
your wife and child died..

466
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:26,346
..during the Jan-Laxmi
Sahakari Bank heist.

467
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:28,516
The Court has sentenced Liak
to 20 years of imprisonment.

468
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,558
How do you feel?

469
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,525
Do you think you have got justice?

470
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:35,087
How do you feel, sir? 20 years...
How do you feel?

471
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:37,133
Answer us, sir.

472
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:39,226
Did you get the justice, sir?

473
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,464
Say something, sir. Sir.. sir..
- 20 years.

474
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,381
How many pages left?

475
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,076
40.

476
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:32,017
I read the murderer's name
while you were bathing.

477
00:33:32,077 --> 00:33:33,784
The man hiding behind the cupboard..
- Raghu!

478
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,082
Don't do that.

479
00:33:35,147 --> 00:33:36,626
lam telling you, don't do that.

480
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,558
(in Tamil) Don't pester me

481
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:42,564
"I don't know what you say."

482
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:45,033
"I don't know...don't
know what you say."

483
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:47,400
"But I want to play
the game of love.."

484
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:50,099
lam at the climax,
please don't disturb me. Vamoose!

485
00:33:50,462 --> 00:33:52,772
I can give you a better climax.

486
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:55,577
Oh really?

487
00:34:02,674 --> 00:34:05,678
So let's see what you got!

488
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:08,121
Yeah!
- Yeah!

489
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:10,551
I am waiting.

490
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:13,221
Uncle. Uncle. Uncle.

491
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:16,497
I've seen you on TV.

492
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:20,602
Uncle.

493
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:24,332
Isn't he from that TV serial?

494
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,340
Why would a TV actor
travel on a train?

495
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:28,377
If we can, so can he!
- He can't!

496
00:34:28,467 --> 00:34:31,380
Mister, aren't you Kusum's
husband from that TV serial?

497
00:34:33,205 --> 00:34:35,378
Did you take part in "Kaun Banega Crorepati
(Who wants to be a Millionaire"?

498
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:36,713
Yes, I think I had seen him.

499
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:39,153
I think he was one of
the contestants on that show.

500
00:34:39,211 --> 00:34:40,053
Must be! Looks familiar.

501
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:42,022
Aren't you the guy
whose wife and kid were killed..

502
00:34:42,047 --> 00:34:43,492
..during the bank heist.

503
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,729
Don't you have any manners at all?!

504
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:43,210
"I search for my sweetheart."

505
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,349
Have you lost your mind?

506
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:46,350
Hey"

507
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:48,049
Are you crazy?

508
00:35:48,113 --> 00:35:53,062
"But he is nowhere to be found"

509
00:35:54,619 --> 00:36:02,060
"His memory is a wound in my soul..."

510
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:09,537
"Separation is my eternal destiny."

511
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,141
Can't you understand?

512
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:19,020
"It's lost...lost.."

513
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:22,689
"What we stole away from time."

514
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:26,559
"And hid in our dreams."

515
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:32,429
"it's lost...lost.."

516
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:35,664
"What we stole away from time."

517
00:36:35,727 --> 00:36:38,765
"And hid in our dreams."

518
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,204
"The body's finely
woven like a cloth."

519
00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:46,044
"My eyes are drenched."
- Stand up. What happened?

520
00:36:46,071 --> 00:36:49,245
"The body's finely
woven like a cloth."

521
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:52,413
"My eyes are drenched."

522
00:36:52,477 --> 00:36:55,617
What happened?
Stand up...what happened?

523
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:59,455
"My eyes are drenched."

524
00:37:01,753 --> 00:37:03,528
Name?
- Raghu.

525
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,329
Where are you from?
- Pune.

526
00:37:09,094 --> 00:37:11,973
How long will you stay?
- 20 years.

527
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:18,408
After 20 years in jail..

528
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,347
..you won't remember anything, Gabbar.

529
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:26,616
No jail on earth...
can keep Gabbar caged for 20 years.

530
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:30,259
And the clay I escape..

531
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:34,025
Done yet? Be quick!

532
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,120
This is all we have.

533
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:36,665
And the others?

534
00:38:27,105 --> 00:38:29,051
Stop.. stop..

535
00:38:46,758 --> 00:38:48,465
Cabbage on Tuesdays.

536
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:50,028
Gourds on Wednesdays.

537
00:38:50,095 --> 00:38:51,506
Eggplants on Friday.

538
00:38:51,563 --> 00:38:53,065
Potatoes on Saturday.

539
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:54,542
Eggs on Sunday.

540
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:56,442
A Beating on Monday.

541
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:00,006
What clay is it today?

542
00:39:00,972 --> 00:39:05,011
Hey...what clay is it today?

543
00:39:05,944 --> 00:39:07,287
Hey"

544
00:39:23,428 --> 00:39:24,702
Chicken curry!

545
00:39:26,631 --> 00:39:28,110
Mutton!

546
00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:31,480
Mutton-leg soup!

547
00:39:32,237 --> 00:39:34,513
Bread. Whose birthday is it?

548
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:37,052
It's my birthday, get in the line.
- Happy birthday to you!

549
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:39,486
Move on.

550
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,028
Hello.

551
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:22,030
<i>Wage, come in,</i>

552
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,465
There's a crow electrocuted
at picket no.3.

553
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:28,367
We'll need to cut-off
the power-supply for 10-15 minutes.

554
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,700
So we can get the crow out.

555
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,679
Get him!

556
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:18,281
I did meet him...in Tiharjail.
-Who?

557
00:42:18,336 --> 00:42:20,646
Charles Shobraj.

558
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:23,185
What a deadly man.

559
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:25,152
Amazing personality.

560
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:27,683
He escaped from jail 14 times
- What are you saying?

561
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:31,352
Afghanistan...Paris...Bangkok.

562
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:33,327
He even broke out of Tihar.
- I see.

563
00:42:33,451 --> 00:42:35,124
And this Kaalia..

564
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,290
Hey Kaalia..

565
00:42:36,454 --> 00:42:40,368
"It's impossible to restrain anyone.."

566
00:42:40,425 --> 00:42:45,101
"The hunter's a bit eccentric."

567
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:47,168
"The bird will fly free one day.."

568
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,733
Congratulations, Liak.

569
00:42:49,634 --> 00:42:52,080
This time you made
it out of the gates.

570
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:56,812
Keep at it...you will definitely make it
to the bus stop in another 10-12 years.

571
00:42:57,608 --> 00:42:58,552
Hey, you..

572
00:42:59,644 --> 00:43:00,554
Catch him. Catch him.

573
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:04,386
Catch him someone..

574
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:25,340
I didn't do anything.

575
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:26,604
He just fell down!

576
00:43:55,767 --> 00:43:58,771
Come and drench me, O rain!

577
00:43:59,037 --> 00:44:02,018
Come and drench me, O rain!

578
00:44:02,073 --> 00:44:06,249
Wash over me and cleanse my mind

579
00:44:06,311 --> 00:44:10,555
Wash over me and cleanse my mind

580
00:44:10,615 --> 00:44:13,425
Come and drench me, O rain!

581
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:16,431
Come and drench me, O rain!

582
00:44:16,621 --> 00:44:19,329
How long can I hold back?

583
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:22,200
How long can I hold back?

584
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:26,333
The flute yearns to sing.

585
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:30,368
The flute yearns to sing.

586
00:44:30,435 --> 00:44:33,314
How long can I hold back?

587
00:44:33,438 --> 00:44:36,078
How long can I hold back?

588
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:40,020
The flute yearns to sing.

589
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:44,015
The flute yearns to sing.

590
00:44:44,082 --> 00:44:46,790
It calls me..

591
00:44:48,553 --> 00:44:50,032
Mr. Raghav?

592
00:44:53,324 --> 00:44:56,066
Thank God! I should
be given a medal for finding you.

593
00:44:56,461 --> 00:44:57,531
May I come in?

594
00:44:57,595 --> 00:45:00,201
I don't want to buy anything.
- No, I am not selling anything.

595
00:45:00,264 --> 00:45:01,368
Please.

596
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:02,308
Thank you.

597
00:45:07,972 --> 00:45:09,007
Shobha.

598
00:45:10,308 --> 00:45:12,288
I run a NGO. Prayaas.

599
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:16,082
We work towards
rehabilitating jail inmates.

600
00:45:19,117 --> 00:45:20,289
Actually...

601
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:26,763
I am here because of Liak.

602
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:28,628
Liak Tungekar.

603
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,197
He's got stomach cancer.

604
00:45:31,262 --> 00:45:33,640
He's got only a year.

605
00:45:33,998 --> 00:45:35,068
What do you want?

606
00:45:35,133 --> 00:45:37,374
He can be released
on medical grounds.

607
00:45:37,435 --> 00:45:38,641
Seek treatment.

608
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:41,309
He can live the rest
of his life respectably.

609
00:45:42,507 --> 00:45:45,078
If...you give him a pardon letter.

610
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:49,352
ls he in pain?
- Excuse me?

611
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,086
Pain?

612
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:55,295
Not yet, but...
he's undergoing Chemo.

613
00:45:55,353 --> 00:45:58,459
He should have been publicly
hanged 15 years ago.

614
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:00,291
But this isn't bad either.

615
00:46:00,358 --> 00:46:01,962
He'll die a slow death.

616
00:46:12,003 --> 00:46:13,107
Actually...you've
come all the way here..

617
00:46:13,171 --> 00:46:15,117
to give me this news, so thank you

618
00:46:15,673 --> 00:46:17,209
Ms...?
- Shobha.

619
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:19,084
Shobha.

620
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:21,321
I feel like celebrating today.

621
00:46:21,546 --> 00:46:23,287
I might order a Chinese meal.

622
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:26,351
Raghav, Liak's been
in jail for 15 years.

623
00:46:26,417 --> 00:46:28,260
He's sick, and he's dying.

624
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,458
And all he asks is
to die outside jail.

625
00:46:30,588 --> 00:46:33,034
In his own home, close to his mother.

626
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:36,264
Only you can fulfill his last wish.

627
00:46:36,327 --> 00:46:39,638
So p
ease...forgive him.

628
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:43,137
Do you have kids, Ms. Shobha.

629
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:46,205
I have a daughter...Nitasha.

630
00:46:47,371 --> 00:46:49,009
She's in the 4th grade.

631
00:46:55,446 --> 00:46:59,690
Imagine if someone like Liak abducts
your daughter, and kills her.

632
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:01,388
And you have see her dissected body..

633
00:47:01,452 --> 00:47:06,026
..in the postmortem
room of some hospital.

634
00:47:07,525 --> 00:47:11,701
Will you forgive?
Because it's been 15 years?

635
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:16,410
I don't know.

636
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:18,507
But I do know...

637
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:21,675
...that people can change
after spending time in jail.

638
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:24,181
Meet him once.

639
00:47:24,475 --> 00:47:28,013
See for yourself, and then decide.

640
00:47:30,448 --> 00:47:32,257
I've brought his reports.

641
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:35,627
I just want to show
you all these things.

642
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:39,025
Goodnight.

643
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:53,343
I've left my card.

644
00:47:53,571 --> 00:47:55,517
In case you change your mind.

645
00:47:58,643 --> 00:48:00,520
Be careful at the over-bridge.

646
00:48:01,112 --> 00:48:03,023
It gets foggy during the monsoons.

647
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:10,057
With or without your help...
Liak will find release in a year.

648
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:11,564
That's the decision of God.

649
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:13,730
But what about you?

650
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:18,172
You don't even have a picture
of your wife and child in this house.

651
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:20,667
You're in a prison yourself.

652
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:51,697
Mr. Raghav?

653
00:49:53,057 --> 00:49:55,196
Govind Mishra, remember?

654
00:49:55,259 --> 00:49:57,603
Three promotions,
two bypass surgeries!

655
00:49:59,196 --> 00:50:01,472
I am retiring at the end of the month.

656
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:04,237
But an open case still hurts.

657
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:10,485
If Liak is released,
he will surely contact his partner.

658
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,681
And then you will catch him, right?

659
00:50:17,248 --> 00:50:19,194
Madam, fruits aren't allowed inside.

660
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:20,752
Let him take it.

661
00:50:21,085 --> 00:50:22,155
Okay.
- Thank you.

662
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:23,221
Yadav.

663
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:43,175
Thank you, sir.

664
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:48,149
If you forgive me,
I can get out of here.

665
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:51,285
They say I've got only
one year left to live.

666
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:54,558
My life's..

667
00:50:54,618 --> 00:50:56,427
My life's ruined.

668
00:50:58,656 --> 00:51:04,004
I feel terrible about
what happened to your family.

669
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:07,209
I've heard all this 15 years ago.

670
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:10,170
Tell me something new.

671
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:13,608
Shall I?

672
00:51:14,338 --> 00:51:17,547
I feel so terrible about your family..

673
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:20,415
The first thing I'll do after
getting out is meet my partner..

674
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:22,422
..take my share of the loot.

675
00:51:23,147 --> 00:51:26,253
And have a good time
with Jhimli for 10 months.

676
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:30,454
No, Liak.

677
00:51:32,323 --> 00:51:34,269
There's just one
way to get out of here.

678
00:51:36,193 --> 00:51:37,604
Tell me the name of your partner

679
00:51:37,661 --> 00:51:40,073
How can I tell you what I don't know?

680
00:51:40,297 --> 00:51:43,073
I tried telling the police..
- You're going to die here.

681
00:51:47,171 --> 00:51:48,309
You have a family?

682
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,546
A Daughter.

683
00:51:51,676 --> 00:51:55,385
Don't you find this job tough?
- Yes.

684
00:51:58,782 --> 00:51:59,760
Raghu?

685
00:51:59,817 --> 00:52:01,160
Excuse me.

686
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:23,146
"As you set foot on
the threshold of my heart."

687
00:52:23,207 --> 00:52:31,183
"I dedicated my life to you forever,
beloved."

688
00:52:31,248 --> 00:52:34,229
"I learned to live...live.."

689
00:52:34,285 --> 00:52:39,701
"I learned how to live, sweetheart."

690
00:52:39,757 --> 00:52:44,263
"I don't know how to liven"

691
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:49,573
"I don't know how to live
without you, sweetheart."

692
00:52:54,538 --> 00:52:58,816
"Every word I said
about you...is true."

693
00:52:59,043 --> 00:53:03,389
"Straight from my heart."

694
00:53:03,447 --> 00:53:06,985
"Since we met..."

695
00:53:07,051 --> 00:53:11,124
"..my world feels beautiful, my love."

696
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:15,659
"I've finally found my sky."

697
00:53:15,726 --> 00:53:20,175
"We complete each other."

698
00:53:20,231 --> 00:53:28,048
"I dedicated my life to you forever,
beloved."

699
00:53:28,105 --> 00:53:32,554
"I learned to live...live.."

700
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:37,025
"I learned how to liven"

701
00:53:38,682 --> 00:53:41,288
Sir, I am Liak's mother.

702
00:53:41,352 --> 00:53:43,298
Forgive me,
but I am not signing any letter.

703
00:53:43,587 --> 00:53:45,191
Sir..
- Sorry.

704
00:53:46,023 --> 00:53:50,335
Sir, I know who was
Liak's partner in crime.

705
00:53:51,362 --> 00:53:52,534
Sir.

706
00:53:55,533 --> 00:53:58,639
I know...his partner's name.

707
00:53:59,804 --> 00:54:02,114
Did Liak send you?
- No, sir.

708
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:04,615
He'll kill me if he finds out.

709
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:09,554
Last week he called me from jail.

710
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:12,756
He told me his partner's name..

711
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:14,223
..and asked me to contact him.

712
00:54:14,285 --> 00:54:17,232
I've got his phone number and address.

713
00:54:18,355 --> 00:54:20,995
Don't let my son die in jail.

714
00:54:21,024 --> 00:54:22,332
Come in.

715
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,069
Forgive him.
- Come in.

716
00:54:25,462 --> 00:54:27,533
You know his partner's name
and address, don't you?

717
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:30,636
Yes, sir.
- Come...p
ease sit.

718
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:37,341
Sir.

719
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:39,476
Sir, I have been blessed with
a baby girl. Sweets for you.

720
00:54:39,543 --> 00:54:41,079
Congrats.
- Thank you, sir.

721
00:54:41,145 --> 00:54:43,022
Sir, you've to come over
for the naming ceremony.

722
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:45,219
Sorry, I am going on a break.
- Are you going home?

723
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:46,454
Yes.

724
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:09,307
On 27thMay, 2000 Liak Tungekar..

725
00:55:09,406 --> 00:55:13,183
..and his missing accomplice murdered
my wife Misha and son Robin.

726
00:55:13,244 --> 00:55:15,190
..during a bank heist.

727
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:17,292
The court sentenced Liak
to 20 years in prison..

728
00:55:17,347 --> 00:55:19,588
..of which he has served 15.

729
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:22,756
Last week I was informed
that Liak is suffering from cancer.

730
00:55:23,053 --> 00:55:24,031
I can never forgive him...

731
00:55:24,088 --> 00:55:27,194
the senseless deaths
of my wife and child...

732
00:55:27,257 --> 00:55:30,033
And yet, Liak dying in jail
won't give me any solace.

733
00:55:30,594 --> 00:55:34,064
I request the court to cut short
the remainder of Liak's sentence.

734
00:55:35,466 --> 00:55:36,774
I want him to be released..

735
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,606
..so that he can receive treatment
and live the rest of his..

736
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:41,172
...life with dignity.

737
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:49,350
lam going...to the bus stop.

738
00:55:49,413 --> 00:55:51,518
And then straight to Bangkok.

739
00:55:51,582 --> 00:55:54,256
I'll get all the massages.
Thai...Sandwich...the works!

740
00:55:54,318 --> 00:55:55,262
Give him a good foot massage ok...

741
00:55:55,319 --> 00:55:56,559
Do it correctly, okay?

742
00:56:16,273 --> 00:56:17,411
Yeah.

743
00:56:19,243 --> 00:56:20,449
But why did you break the legs?

744
00:56:24,281 --> 00:56:27,160
They're foreigners;
they want the entire roast chicken.

745
00:56:27,985 --> 00:56:28,588
Yeah.

746
00:56:28,652 --> 00:56:30,222
Good morning, sir.
It's on the third floor.

747
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,666
See you.

748
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:14,658
0h!

749
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:41,857
Excuse me, do you need help.

750
00:58:41,985 --> 00:58:43,726
No, I am fine.
Thanks.

751
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:48,559
Okay.

752
00:58:57,734 --> 00:59:00,180
Listen...l said I don't need help.

753
00:59:00,837 --> 00:59:03,249
My husband's on his way to pick me up.

754
00:59:03,907 --> 00:59:05,682
You can...go.

755
00:59:07,077 --> 00:59:09,148
Do you read the papers?
- What?

756
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:10,986
This area isn't safe.

757
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:14,990
Recently there's been a
few robberies and a murder.

758
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:18,758
Don't worry, I'll wait
here until your husband arrives.

759
00:59:19,256 --> 00:59:21,566
No, no, no, I am fine. Really.

760
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:26,700
If you wish, I'll wait by your car.

761
00:59:26,764 --> 00:59:28,641
You can take my car.

762
00:59:28,832 --> 00:59:31,210
There's a petrol pump up ahead,
you can get help.

763
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:42,281
Do you watch films?
- Sometimes.

764
00:59:43,146 --> 00:59:46,650
When a girl asks for
a lift on a deserted road at night...

765
00:59:46,717 --> 00:59:49,527
either the driver's a
serial killer, or the girl's a ghost.

766
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,224
You think negative.

767
00:59:51,288 --> 00:59:53,029
It can be a romantic film too.

768
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:57,568
"I met a beautiful stranger.."

769
00:59:57,895 --> 00:59:59,772
Okay, okay...

770
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:03,168
I've a big-tough husband,
and he has your number.

771
01:00:03,233 --> 01:00:05,736
Really?
- Of course, I just messaged him.

772
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:08,276
Whether you're a lover or a killer,
you'll be caught.

773
01:00:08,538 --> 01:00:11,109
Already caught, madam.
- Oh, you're married.

774
01:00:11,175 --> 01:00:12,552
Thank God for that.

775
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:14,145
I was really scared.

776
01:00:15,045 --> 01:00:16,615
Lovely.

777
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,250
And he's so adorable.

778
01:00:18,315 --> 01:00:20,886
What are their names?
- Misha. Robin.

779
01:00:20,984 --> 01:00:22,986
Oh...very cute.

780
01:00:25,022 --> 01:00:26,262
Was it a love-marriage?

781
01:00:26,323 --> 01:00:29,634
Oh...so sorry. I am just
returning from a wedding, so..

782
01:00:29,693 --> 01:00:31,001
..that's the only thing on my mind.

783
01:00:31,061 --> 01:00:33,667
You don't have to answer that at all.
- Love marriage.

784
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:35,232
Ours was a love-marriage too.

785
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:42,676
It's here?

786
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:45,584
Yes, on the left.

787
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:50,589
Thank you. Thank you so much,
I really appreciate it.

788
01:00:51,081 --> 01:00:54,153
Coffee?
- Won't your husband be at home?

789
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:58,522
Actually, we own a restaurant.

790
01:00:58,589 --> 01:00:59,624
Konkan Queen.
- ls that yours?

791
01:00:59,689 --> 01:01:00,690
Yes, it's in Vimaan Nagar.

792
01:01:00,757 --> 01:01:02,737
It's the best sea food in Pune.

793
01:01:02,793 --> 01:01:04,773
Why don't you bring Misha
and Robin along? - Yeah.

794
01:01:04,828 --> 01:01:06,535
Please come.
Okay.

795
01:01:06,563 --> 01:01:08,099
Kanchan.
- Raghu.

796
01:01:08,165 --> 01:01:09,769
Take care, Kanchan.

797
01:02:11,528 --> 01:02:13,030
Hi.
- Surprise!

798
01:02:13,096 --> 01:02:15,098
Oh, my God.
What a pleasant surprise.

799
01:02:15,165 --> 01:02:16,735
Did you meet Harman?
- No.

800
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,279
Hold on.

801
01:02:23,106 --> 01:02:24,915
<i>This is RaghumHarman.</i>

802
01:02:25,008 --> 01:02:26,646
He dropped me home last night.

803
01:02:26,710 --> 01:02:27,780
Hello, Harman.

804
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:29,153
Thank you.

805
01:02:29,212 --> 01:02:30,623
Sit.
- Yeah.

806
01:02:32,115 --> 01:02:34,561
You didn't bring
Misha and Robin along?

807
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:38,327
They are no more.
- What?

808
01:02:38,555 --> 01:02:43,504
Actually, they died 15
years ago during a bank heist.

809
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:44,734
I am so sorry.

810
01:02:44,794 --> 01:02:46,671
I didn't get the opportunity
to tell you last night.

811
01:02:46,730 --> 01:02:48,175
And you were already so stressed.

812
01:02:48,231 --> 01:02:49,938
I didn't want to bring up the past.

813
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,742
Oh my God. I am really sorry.
What a tragedy.

814
01:02:52,803 --> 01:02:55,682
No, the real tragedy
is that it's been 15 years..

815
01:02:55,806 --> 01:02:57,979
..and the murderer is still at large.

816
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:04,281
lam very hungry.
What's the specialty here?

817
01:03:04,814 --> 01:03:06,851
I'll just get it.
You'll love it.

818
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:13,289
Cheers.

819
01:03:30,173 --> 01:03:32,585
Have we met before?

820
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:36,151
You have met my wife and child.

821
01:03:36,279 --> 01:03:38,555
Main Street, Bank robbery.

822
01:03:39,149 --> 01:03:41,652
What rubbish.

823
01:03:43,186 --> 01:03:44,563
Nonsense.

824
01:03:46,790 --> 01:03:49,930
I know everything, Harman.
- What do you know?

825
01:03:51,861 --> 01:03:53,238
You know nothing.

826
01:03:53,597 --> 01:03:56,271
If you know, why don't you go to
the police? What are you doing here?

827
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:57,944
I wanted to get a good look at you..

828
01:03:58,001 --> 01:03:59,537
..before I go to the police.

829
01:04:01,004 --> 01:04:01,982
Anyway...

830
01:04:02,038 --> 01:04:02,982
Sit.

831
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:07,988
What do you want?

832
01:04:08,044 --> 01:04:10,854
You need to eat this by hand,
for better taste.

833
01:04:11,181 --> 01:04:12,216
Thank you.

834
01:04:12,616 --> 01:04:15,187
By the way, your husband
has invited me home tomorrow..

835
01:04:15,252 --> 01:04:18,859
..for lunch.
- Oh, that's wonderful.

836
01:04:19,623 --> 01:04:21,227
I forgot the sauce.

837
01:04:21,291 --> 01:04:23,635
I'll be back in a bit. Okay.

838
01:04:27,731 --> 01:04:29,233
She doesn't know anything.

839
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:32,580
Please don't involve my wife.
- See you tomorrow.

840
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:36,548
At lunch.

841
01:04:42,178 --> 01:04:43,657
Where did he go?

842
01:04:44,247 --> 01:04:46,249
He got an urgent phone call.

843
01:05:05,235 --> 01:05:06,236
Hi, Raghu.

844
01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:09,141
Liak will be released tomorrow.

845
01:05:10,473 --> 01:05:13,010
I was thinking about...
meeting you personally".

846
01:05:13,043 --> 01:05:14,113
..to say thank you.

847
01:05:14,144 --> 01:05:15,418
When can we meet?

848
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:29,759
Hello, Harman.
- Hi.

849
01:05:29,826 --> 01:05:30,998
Please sit.

850
01:05:35,532 --> 01:05:37,603
Lunch was a great idea,
thank you.

851
01:05:37,801 --> 01:05:39,109
I am so sorry!

852
01:05:39,536 --> 01:05:40,844
I really am sorry.

853
01:05:41,171 --> 01:05:43,913
Harman told me everything last night.

854
01:05:44,974 --> 01:05:46,476
I don't..

855
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:49,924
Look, I admit I was involved
in that bank robbery.

856
01:05:50,213 --> 01:05:53,023
But I didn't murder your wife and kid.

857
01:05:53,149 --> 01:05:54,719
I swear.

858
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:56,661
Liak fired the gun.

859
01:05:56,853 --> 01:05:58,230
I was in the back seat.

860
01:05:58,488 --> 01:06:00,126
I didn't know that gun was loaded.

861
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:01,863
Liak says the same thing.

862
01:06:03,093 --> 01:06:04,766
I am really sorry.

863
01:06:10,667 --> 01:06:11,805
Nice house.

864
01:06:12,903 --> 01:06:15,543
Misha would've really
liked this house.

865
01:06:21,111 --> 01:06:22,954
Misha loved these things.

866
01:06:23,046 --> 01:06:26,789
Everywhere we went,
she collected these things.

867
01:06:26,850 --> 01:06:28,989
But never took them out.

868
01:06:30,186 --> 01:06:33,963
She would say that Robin might
break it, or... Pune's too dusty..

869
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:37,168
She liked all this.

870
01:06:38,528 --> 01:06:39,973
What do you want from us?

871
01:06:43,033 --> 01:06:44,137
What can you give?

872
01:06:45,168 --> 01:06:46,476
Money.

873
01:06:47,671 --> 01:06:48,479
No.. No..

874
01:06:49,806 --> 01:06:50,978
Oh my God.

875
01:06:51,474 --> 01:06:52,248
Oh my God.

876
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:56,716
No.. No.. No..

877
01:06:56,780 --> 01:06:57,224
Alright.

878
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:58,584
You'll give me money?

879
01:06:59,082 --> 01:07:00,493
How much can you give?

880
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:12,734
10 million.
You have 20 seconds.

881
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:15,737
Give me a better answer,
Or I'm calling the police.

882
01:07:15,799 --> 01:07:17,107
25 million.

883
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:21,710
I've Liak's share as well.
You can take that too. - Take everything.

884
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:24,750
Everything.
The hotel, house...everything.

885
01:07:24,808 --> 01:07:28,813
l...know Harman.
He can never kill anyone.

886
01:07:29,646 --> 01:07:31,557
I am sorry. I am sorry.

887
01:07:31,748 --> 01:07:34,024
Forgive us, please.

888
01:07:34,951 --> 01:07:38,524
Harman. Kanchan loves you a lot.

889
01:07:39,155 --> 01:07:40,566
Apologize to her.

890
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:44,034
Say "I am a murderer, Kanchan".

891
01:07:45,095 --> 01:07:49,771
"Yet you want to save me. Thank you."
- Okay.

892
01:07:50,033 --> 01:07:51,171
Say it!

893
01:07:52,535 --> 01:07:53,536
Say it!

894
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:57,748
Kanchan, I am a murderer.

895
01:07:58,708 --> 01:08:00,915
Yet you want to save me.

896
01:08:02,612 --> 01:08:03,647
Thank you.

897
01:08:08,117 --> 01:08:09,790
"I forgive you, Harman."

898
01:08:10,587 --> 01:08:11,725
Say it.

899
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:15,764
I forgive you, Harman.

900
01:08:15,825 --> 01:08:18,328
"But in return." Say it.

901
01:08:18,561 --> 01:08:25,103
But in return...
- I want to sleep with Raghu.

902
01:08:30,573 --> 01:08:32,211
Please stop..

903
01:08:32,275 --> 01:08:33,754
I am ready. I am ready.

904
01:08:33,810 --> 01:08:35,687
I am ready. I am ready.
- Raghu...

905
01:08:35,745 --> 01:08:37,349
Koko! Go away.
- I am ready.

906
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:40,026
Go away Koko. Have you lost your mind?
- Will you leave us alone then?

907
01:08:40,083 --> 01:08:42,222
What are you saying?
- Just shut up!

908
01:08:42,285 --> 01:08:44,231
Do you want him to go to the police?

909
01:08:45,054 --> 01:08:46,897
Come, the bedroom's upstairs.

910
01:08:46,990 --> 01:08:48,663
Have you lost your mind?

911
01:08:48,725 --> 01:08:50,102
Come on.
- Koko.

912
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:52,298
I'm ready to do anything you want.
- Koko.

913
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:54,908
Just shut up!

914
01:08:54,998 --> 01:08:58,207
Now you...try and forget this!

915
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:03,276
No... Koko!!

916
01:09:22,191 --> 01:09:23,295
Take your clothes off.

917
01:09:29,766 --> 01:09:30,801
Right here.

918
01:10:12,675 --> 01:10:14,552
What the hell is wrong with you?

919
01:10:14,911 --> 01:10:17,915
You're ready to sleep
with me to save a murderer?

920
01:10:18,548 --> 01:10:20,152
He killed a child.

921
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:21,893
He's a murderer.
- No, no..

922
01:10:21,985 --> 01:10:22,656
He..
- No.

923
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:25,325
Harman didn't kill Misha and Robin.

924
01:10:25,788 --> 01:10:28,701
I believe him, please trust me.

925
01:10:33,763 --> 01:10:34,707
Okay.

926
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,939
Let's have some fun.

927
01:11:04,127 --> 01:11:07,233
If you fall down the stairs outside...

928
01:11:07,897 --> 01:11:10,969
You'll hurt your leg, won't you?
- Yes.

929
01:11:11,234 --> 01:11:12,713
How will you scream?

930
01:11:13,303 --> 01:11:14,247
Scream?

931
01:11:14,871 --> 01:11:15,679
Scream.

932
01:11:15,905 --> 01:11:16,975
<i>Louder.</i>

933
01:11:17,607 --> 01:11:19,712
<i>Louder.</i>

934
01:11:20,543 --> 01:11:21,578
<i>Louder.</i>

935
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:30,787
Say my name.
- Raghu.

936
01:11:31,888 --> 01:11:33,299
Raghu. Raghu.

937
01:11:33,556 --> 01:11:34,261
Raghu.

938
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:37,237
Scream. Scream. Scream.

939
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:39,068
Scream.
- Raghu.

940
01:11:43,266 --> 01:11:44,506
Yes, Kanchan!

941
01:11:44,567 --> 01:11:45,807
Yes, Kanchan!
- Raghu.

942
01:11:45,868 --> 01:11:47,176
Yes, Kanchan!

943
01:11:51,674 --> 01:11:53,779
Liak is being released tomorrow.

944
01:11:54,844 --> 01:11:57,085
What was the agreement
between you two?

945
01:11:59,849 --> 01:12:03,763
I have to keep his
money and passport ready.

946
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:05,766
He said he'll call me once he's out.

947
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:14,567
When Liak calls,
you'll tell me, right?

948
01:12:16,099 --> 01:12:17,077
Yes.

949
01:12:18,635 --> 01:12:20,205
Lunch was good.

950
01:12:21,271 --> 01:12:22,909
I'll be back.

951
01:12:31,781 --> 01:12:33,226
Nothing happened.

952
01:12:34,584 --> 01:12:37,064
Nothing happened, Harman.

953
01:12:38,855 --> 01:12:40,960
He didn't even touch me.

954
01:12:42,658 --> 01:12:44,035
I think he's trying to torture us.

955
01:12:44,093 --> 01:12:46,095
He's completely insane.

956
01:12:48,698 --> 01:12:50,234
Nothing happened.

957
01:13:25,268 --> 01:13:26,713
Greetings, auntie.

958
01:13:27,203 --> 01:13:28,739
Greetings.

959
01:13:29,672 --> 01:13:31,117
Greetings.
- Hello.

960
01:13:31,174 --> 01:13:32,585
Recognize me?

961
01:13:33,276 --> 01:13:35,688
Hey, Liak.
- Wilson.

962
01:13:36,846 --> 01:13:40,692
Idiot, you became a priest.

963
01:13:41,484 --> 01:13:42,861
Drop in at the Church.

964
01:13:46,589 --> 01:13:48,626
You were supposed
to come tomorrow.

965
01:13:48,691 --> 01:13:50,170
Fine, I'll come tomorrow.

966
01:13:51,494 --> 01:13:52,734
Come on in.

967
01:14:00,203 --> 01:14:03,013
I had prayed to Ajmer Sharif.

968
01:14:03,973 --> 01:14:07,250
Now that you're back,
We must go...

969
01:14:08,678 --> 01:14:10,555
Who'll look after the tea shop?

970
01:14:31,868 --> 01:14:34,007
Pakya, get me some soda.

971
01:14:36,606 --> 01:14:37,983
Jhimli who?

972
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:39,747
She was also called Shabnum.

973
01:14:40,977 --> 01:14:42,923
She worked here 15 years ago.

974
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:44,788
This isn't Maratha Mandir?

975
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:48,052
Want me instead?

976
01:14:49,252 --> 01:14:51,254
Yes...
- No..

977
01:14:56,059 --> 01:14:57,129
You?

978
01:15:00,096 --> 01:15:00,733
When did they release you?

979
01:15:00,797 --> 01:15:02,037
Didn't you hear?

980
01:15:02,098 --> 01:15:03,873
It was in the newspapers.
- What?

981
01:15:03,966 --> 01:15:06,037
I did some good deeds in jail..

982
01:15:06,102 --> 01:15:08,013
..so, they released me early.

983
01:15:08,071 --> 01:15:09,550
Won't you invite me in?

984
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:18,150
Did you break-out of jail?

985
01:15:20,983 --> 01:15:23,554
Ohhh...my veggies

986
01:15:29,559 --> 01:15:31,129
Will you eat something?

987
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:32,797
Nice flat.

988
01:15:33,262 --> 01:15:34,969
This is a classy pad. Wow

989
01:15:35,031 --> 01:15:36,203
Who gave you the address?

990
01:15:36,265 --> 01:15:38,108
I went to the old haunt

991
01:15:39,001 --> 01:15:40,571
Why did you go there?

992
01:15:40,636 --> 01:15:42,206
I went looking for you.

993
01:15:43,206 --> 01:15:44,742
How about a drink?

994
01:15:45,641 --> 01:15:48,986
Do you drink so much?
- No, he gets it.

995
01:15:49,045 --> 01:15:50,649
He can't take it home.

996
01:15:52,782 --> 01:15:54,728
This is Patill sir's home.

997
01:15:54,984 --> 01:15:57,123
Lives in Jalna with his family.

998
01:15:57,186 --> 01:15:58,631
He comes here once a week.

999
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:05,836
ls Patil a...politician or gangster?
- He is loaded.

1000
01:16:06,829 --> 01:16:08,604
Wants to be a politician.

1001
01:16:10,499 --> 01:16:15,209
Jhimli, I needed to borrow some money,
I'll return it.

1002
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:16,675
How much?

1003
01:16:16,739 --> 01:16:18,047
Whatever you can lend me.

1004
01:16:18,107 --> 01:16:19,711
I'll return it with interest.

1005
01:16:20,076 --> 01:16:21,077
Yeah.

1006
01:16:22,545 --> 01:16:24,218
You cannot pay my interest.

1007
01:16:46,669 --> 01:16:47,977
Tell me something..

1008
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:53,011
<i>How is Pat“ as a person ?</i>

1009
01:16:53,476 --> 01:16:54,546
He's fine. Didn't I tell you?

1010
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:55,680
You did?

1011
01:16:59,916 --> 01:17:02,021
Does he love you?

1012
01:17:02,652 --> 01:17:04,154
What do you care?

1013
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:12,503
Tell me.

1014
01:17:13,696 --> 01:17:15,505
Does he love you like I do?

1015
01:17:16,499 --> 01:17:18,001
Do you love him?

1016
01:17:25,174 --> 01:17:26,676
Look...

1017
01:17:27,944 --> 01:17:30,584
...once upon a time you
and I made an amazing couple.

1018

I so looked forward to meeting you...

1019
01:17:35,518 --> 01:17:37,623
.. spending time with you.

1020
01:17:39,522 --> 01:17:41,900
And you do it
all by going to jail.

1021
01:17:44,727 --> 01:17:46,866
Take this money and get lost.

1022
01:17:53,602 --> 01:17:57,015
You're right.
Back then we were an item.

1023
01:17:58,107 --> 01:17:59,780

You'll follow me.

We'll save some money too.

1036

So?

1037
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:47,530
Where were you?
Where have you been?

1039
01:18:50,826 --> 01:18:52,863
It's very late, get some sleep.

1040
01:18:53,529 --> 01:18:55,531
If only you would let me sleep.

1041
01:18:55,698 --> 01:18:57,769
You're a real pain..

1042
01:19:17,253 --> 01:19:18,027
Hello.

I heard that you own a restaurant now.

And you even got married.

Where are you calling from?

1047

Your number can be tracked.
Whose number is this?

1048
01:19:33,869 --> 01:19:36,042
I didn't utter your name for 15 years

Hello. - Hello, bhabhi
I am Liak, Harman's friend.

1059
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:13,816
I was in South Africa for 15 years.
I just returned to India.

1060
01:20:13,876 --> 01:20:15,913
How are you?
- I am fine.

1061
01:20:16,012 --> 01:20:17,821
I've heard a lot about you.

1062
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:19,855
Please come home someday.

1063
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:30,599
10 o'clock, Bus Depot.

1064
01:20:38,567 --> 01:20:39,944
Call Raghu.

1065
01:20:41,870 --> 01:20:42,712
Let me think.

1066
01:20:42,771 --> 01:20:45,149
There's nothing to think. Call Raghu.

1067
01:20:45,541 --> 01:20:48,112
You're concerned about Raghu a lot.
- I am concerned about Raghu?

1068
01:20:48,177 --> 01:20:49,520
Yeah.

1069
01:20:49,545 --> 01:20:50,888
Call him.

1070
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:52,888
I am meeting Liak tomorrow.

1071
01:20:52,949 --> 01:20:54,053
Then I'll call Raghu.

1072
01:20:54,116 --> 01:20:55,652
Stupid!

1073
01:20:56,085 --> 01:20:57,826
Whatever Liak is doing is for himself.
- Koko.

1074
01:20:57,886 --> 01:21:00,526
Koko.
- Don't try to save him.

1075
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:02,900
Damn you!

1076
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:06,662
Raghu, Kanchan here.

1077
01:21:06,729 --> 01:21:09,539
Liak called.
Harman wants to talk to you.

1078
01:21:12,802 --> 01:21:13,803

This is the first thing you should
have said. - You didn't ask.

Her eyes were open,
but she couldn't see me.

My daughter plays this. So we
always learn two new words every clay.

1205
01:31:23,045 --> 01:31:25,047
That's why we play this.

01:31:26,715 --> 01:31:28,592
Would you like to play with me?

1207
01:31:32,888 --> 01:31:34,731

01:35:41,937 --> 01:35:43,211
Are you waiting for someone?

1258
01:35:47,742 --> 01:35:48,618
No.

1259
01:35:53,548 --> 01:35:55,789
Your friend's not coming.
- What friend?

1260
01:36:25,980 --> 01:36:27,118
Where's Harman?

1261
01:36:27,782 --> 01:36:29,625
<i>He's gone to Shire“ with the missus.</i>

1262
01:36:30,685 --> 01:36:31,527
Shirdi?

1263
01:36:31,553 --> 01:36:32,156
Yes.

1264
01:36:32,921 --> 01:36:35,299
Liak's been visiting Konkan Queen
Restaurant for the past few clays.

1265
01:36:36,057 --> 01:36:37,297
Yesterday he went there twice.

1266
01:36:39,627 --> 01:36:40,537
ls the food good?

1267
01:36:41,730 --> 01:36:45,769
It's spicy... Tasty!

1268
01:36:46,901 --> 01:36:49,472
You're bound to get a promotion.
Send Kadam.

1269
01:36:49,504 --> 01:36:51,074
Sir, they've been missing for 5 clays.

1270
01:36:51,139 --> 01:36:52,482
Their mobiles are switched off too.

1271
01:36:52,507 --> 01:36:54,987
They booked a room at
the Sun N Sand hotel, Shirdi.

1272
01:36:55,043 --> 01:36:56,147
But they never checked in.

1273
01:36:56,211 --> 01:36:58,088
The car's missing,
and the house locked too.

1274
01:37:03,485 --> 01:37:05,692
Why do you visit
Konkan Queen so often?

1275
01:37:06,154 --> 01:37:07,792
Their prawns are really good.

1276
01:37:08,857 --> 01:37:12,031
You travel 12 kilometers
for their sea-food.

1277
01:37:12,160 --> 01:37:13,639
You're quite the food buff.

1278
01:37:19,167 --> 01:37:23,206
Why did you evade my man
at the cinema hall that clay?

1279
01:37:28,643 --> 01:37:29,781
Did you come here?

1280
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:34,024
I went to get some weed.
I am ill.

1281
01:37:35,783 --> 01:37:38,525
Your people follow me around,
no one sells me the stuff.

1282
01:37:40,155 --> 01:37:41,190
What happened here?

1283
01:37:44,592 --> 01:37:45,900
What do you think?

1284
01:37:48,129 --> 01:37:49,301
I feel".

1285
01:37:50,832 --> 01:37:52,277
Hold on.

1286
01:37:55,637 --> 01:37:56,877
Stop.

1287
01:37:58,773 --> 01:38:00,616
What's he doing here?

1288
01:38:02,544 --> 01:38:04,023
I gave Mrs Harman a lift once.

1289
01:38:04,546 --> 01:38:06,548
And she invited me
to the restaurant.

1290
01:38:08,883 --> 01:38:09,918
Good homely food.

1291
01:38:10,919 --> 01:38:12,694
Liak was praising the food as well.

1292
01:38:14,255 --> 01:38:15,791
What do you want to say?

1293
01:38:16,124 --> 01:38:19,867
15 years ago,
Harman worked in a small garage.

1294
01:38:20,161 --> 01:38:22,141
Salary, only 2000.

1295
01:38:23,131 --> 01:38:24,701
But suddenly he hit some jackpot..

1296
01:38:24,766 --> 01:38:26,245
..and now owns a posh restaurant.

1297
01:38:27,702 --> 01:38:30,808
So you mean...
Harman is Liak's partner.

1298
01:38:31,739 --> 01:38:35,209
Congratulations, sir.
Finally you found him.

1299
01:38:39,247 --> 01:38:40,783
Found him? Not really

1300
01:38:44,752 --> 01:38:47,824
The couple's been
missing since the 5th.

1301
01:38:48,923 --> 01:38:50,095
So?

1302
01:38:51,159 --> 01:38:53,036
You were in Pune on the 5th, right?

1303
01:38:53,828 --> 01:38:54,306
Yes.

1304
01:38:55,630 --> 01:38:56,904
Where were you?

1305
01:39:00,134 --> 01:39:01,306
I was on a lunch date.

1306
01:39:02,136 --> 01:39:03,114
With Shobha.

1307
01:39:04,272 --> 01:39:05,216
At her home.

1308
01:39:07,542 --> 01:39:08,043
How long?

1309
01:39:09,544 --> 01:39:10,181
8 pm.

1310
01:39:12,146 --> 01:39:13,318
8 pm.

1311
01:39:18,019 --> 01:39:21,262
8 pm is my dinner time.

1312
01:39:21,322 --> 01:39:22,665
See you.

1313
01:39:23,591 --> 01:39:25,036
Bye, sir.

1314
01:39:30,598 --> 01:39:33,010
Did you tell anyone about Harman?

1315
01:39:35,570 --> 01:39:37,345
I never told anyone.

1316
01:39:40,342 --> 01:39:43,812
Be honest, and I won't harm you.

1317
01:39:44,879 --> 01:39:46,790
I said I didn't tell anyone...

1318
01:39:51,085 --> 01:39:52,587
Yes, I did.

1319
01:39:52,787 --> 01:39:53,993
I told Raghav.

1320
01:39:55,089 --> 01:39:56,625
And that's the reason you're out here.

1321
01:39:57,792 --> 01:40:00,272
You didn't do a thing
for last 14 years.

1322
01:40:00,528 --> 01:40:02,530
And now you're
threatening your mother.

1323
01:40:13,675 --> 01:40:17,020
What did you tell the inspector?
We had sex?

1324
01:40:17,078 --> 01:40:20,890
All I said that when
I left you were asleep.

1325
01:40:20,948 --> 01:40:22,291
What for?

1326
01:40:22,617 --> 01:40:25,223
You know he asked
me such absurd questions.

1327
01:40:25,286 --> 01:40:27,823
No one ever dared to speak to me like that..
- This is a police investigation.

1328
01:40:27,889 --> 01:40:31,063
I will have to answer
all their questions.

1329
01:40:31,126 --> 01:40:33,163
I don't believe this.

1330
01:40:34,562 --> 01:40:37,202
I thought there was
something between us.

1331
01:40:38,232 --> 01:40:42,009
I really liked you.
- Maybe I didn't like you.

1332
01:40:42,070 --> 01:40:44,880
You sympathize with the
criminals in jail, don't you?

1333
01:40:44,972 --> 01:40:50,513
But what about the people
whose lives they ruined?

1334
01:40:52,780 --> 01:40:54,157
You used me, right?

1335
01:40:55,016 --> 01:40:56,757
Maybe the inspector's right.

1336
01:40:57,685 --> 01:40:59,528
You are involved in some murder.

1337
01:40:59,587 --> 01:41:01,157
He might arrest me.

1338
01:41:01,222 --> 01:41:03,031
Put me in jail.

1339
01:41:03,091 --> 01:41:05,731
Then you'll come visit me.
Hold my hands.

1340
01:41:05,794 --> 01:41:07,774
Relieve my pain.

1341
01:41:08,062 --> 01:41:10,269
Sympathize with me.

1342
01:41:11,266 --> 01:41:13,212
And we can even have
sex in the doctor's cabin.

1343
01:41:13,534 --> 01:41:14,706
How dare..

1344
01:41:55,276 --> 01:41:58,120
Where's the money?
Where's the money?

1345
01:42:00,948 --> 01:42:02,291
Where's my money?

1346
01:43:45,019 --> 01:43:46,123
Where's my money?

1347
01:43:48,122 --> 01:43:49,066
My friend?

1348
01:43:53,194 --> 01:43:55,037
I killed Harman and his wife.

1349
01:43:57,231 --> 01:43:58,232
You killed?

1350
01:44:00,534 --> 01:44:01,535
How did you kill them?

1351
01:44:02,236 --> 01:44:03,237
With a hammer.

1352
01:44:04,572 --> 01:44:06,984
In their own bedroom.

1353
01:44:09,510 --> 01:44:13,549
Do you want to know how?
How I did it? Do you want to hear?

1354
01:44:17,251 --> 01:44:19,595
First I covered the room with plastic.

1355
01:44:20,221 --> 01:44:22,531
When his wife stepped
out after a shower..

1356
01:44:22,990 --> 01:44:24,901
...I severed a blow to her head.

1357
01:44:24,992 --> 01:44:26,869
She fell unconscious.

1358
01:44:27,662 --> 01:44:31,542
Next, when Harman returned
with the money, I killed him too.

1359
01:44:32,667 --> 01:44:34,169
You really killed them?

1360
01:44:37,605 --> 01:44:40,984
Your friend, whose name
you didn't utter for 15 years..

1361
01:44:42,476 --> 01:44:45,184
..was ready to give
me your share of the money.

1362
01:44:47,515 --> 01:44:53,591
And his wife was ready
to sleep with me...to save him.

1363
01:44:55,490 --> 01:44:56,491
Are you telling the truth?

1364
01:44:59,260 --> 01:45:02,537
I buried them in
Khadakvasla sector 3.

1365
01:45:03,197 --> 01:45:05,734
And you will never
find that money.

1366
01:45:11,639 --> 01:45:14,518
And now you're going to kill me too.
- You're already dead.

1367
01:45:15,276 --> 01:45:17,222
You're just going to rot
for few more months.

1368
01:45:51,779 --> 01:45:53,816
Harman didn't kill your wife, I did.

1369
01:46:00,154 --> 01:46:03,499
I was confused.
I went crazy for a moment.

1370
01:46:03,524 --> 01:46:05,663
Your kid fell out and
your wife was screaming.

1371
01:46:05,726 --> 01:46:08,138
Suddenly I pulled
out the gun and shot her.

1372
01:46:09,597 --> 01:46:11,042
I had blown a fuse.

1373
01:46:15,803 --> 01:46:16,941
But you had a cool mind.

1374
01:46:18,272 --> 01:46:20,183
You murdered two people...
with a hammer.

1375
01:46:21,843 --> 01:46:22,981
Innocent people.

1376
01:46:24,878 --> 01:46:26,858
What is the difference..
between you and me

1377
01:46:29,851 --> 01:46:30,852
You've gone crazy.

1378
01:46:32,253 --> 01:46:33,630
Get yourself treated.

1379
01:47:10,624 --> 01:47:12,035
What happened to you?

1380
01:47:12,160 --> 01:47:13,264
What happened?

1381
01:47:16,530 --> 01:47:17,600
Show me.

1382
01:47:17,765 --> 01:47:19,642
Your face is completely swollen.

1383
01:47:20,034 --> 01:47:22,275
You're back to your old ways, right?

1384
01:47:22,670 --> 01:47:24,047
What are you looking at?

1385
01:47:24,839 --> 01:47:26,147
Jhimli.

1386
01:47:27,508 --> 01:47:28,885
lam going to die.

1387
01:47:30,744 --> 01:47:31,882
Huh?

1388
01:47:34,849 --> 01:47:38,092
That's why I was released from jail.
I've got cancer.

1389
01:47:38,552 --> 01:47:40,532
I've just one year to live.

1390
01:47:44,725 --> 01:47:45,669
Yes.

1391
01:47:45,726 --> 01:47:47,000
I was scared to know.

1392
01:47:48,996 --> 01:47:51,533
When I was released,
I thought I'll get my share..

1393
01:47:51,565 --> 01:47:55,570
..because I didn't utter
my partner's name for 15 years.

1394
01:47:56,604 --> 01:48:00,984
And we'll travel, have fun
for 1 O months with that money.

1395
01:48:03,911 --> 01:48:05,219
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

1396
01:48:06,914 --> 01:48:08,587
I wanted to surprise you.

1397
01:48:08,649 --> 01:48:10,253
"Jhimli.."

1398
01:48:14,621 --> 01:48:16,658
Okay, madam...
I'll change this.

1399
01:48:16,724 --> 01:48:19,898
Chicken noodles, right?
- Hey...stop.

1400
01:48:20,861 --> 01:48:21,999
Who are you?

1401
01:48:22,563 --> 01:48:25,601
Sameer.
From Uncle's Kitchen.

1402
01:48:27,268 --> 01:48:28,576
Sameer.

1403
01:48:31,872 --> 01:48:32,680
How's Tony?

1404
01:48:33,641 --> 01:48:36,019
He's fine, okay.
- Okay?

1405
01:48:36,577 --> 01:48:38,147
Give him my regards, alright?
- Okay.

1406
01:48:38,212 --> 01:48:39,850
Tell him I was missing him.
- Fine.

1407
01:48:41,215 --> 01:48:44,094
Tony died a month ago.

1408
01:48:44,718 --> 01:48:46,026
Who is he?

1409
01:48:47,521 --> 01:48:49,558
You misunderstand, sir..
- Shut up.

1410
01:48:49,623 --> 01:48:52,695
He's a friend,
we're meeting after a long time.

1411
01:48:53,527 --> 01:48:56,030
Your friend calls
himself a delivery boy..

1412
01:48:56,096 --> 01:48:59,043
..and walks out with the parcel,
and you just watch.

1413
01:48:59,099 --> 01:49:00,840
You think I am a fool.

1414
01:49:02,136 --> 01:49:03,809
What are you staring at?

1415
01:49:04,571 --> 01:49:06,573
Are you back to whoring again?

1416
01:49:07,241 --> 01:49:09,243
Why you..
- Liak! Liak!

1417
01:49:09,309 --> 01:49:10,720
Stop it.

1418
01:49:10,778 --> 01:49:12,086
Keep it down.

1419
01:49:12,146 --> 01:49:14,148
Liak, let go.
Liak! Get lost.

1420
01:49:14,215 --> 01:49:17,287
Get out. Go.

1421
01:49:17,551 --> 01:49:19,588
Hey...
Go inside!

1422
01:49:19,787 --> 01:49:20,663
Go inside!

1423
01:49:33,334 --> 01:49:34,574
Hey"

1424
01:49:36,837 --> 01:49:38,282
Wait. Wait.

1425
01:49:40,007 --> 01:49:41,145
Are you okay?

1426
01:49:41,809 --> 01:49:43,811
I told him about your cancer.

1427
01:49:43,877 --> 01:49:44,947
Here.

1428
01:49:47,515 --> 01:49:48,755
I don't want it. Keep it.

1429
01:49:48,816 --> 01:49:50,762
Keep it, it's for your treatment.

1430
01:49:50,818 --> 01:49:52,229
I'm getting free treatment
from the government.

1431
01:49:52,286 --> 01:49:53,697
Don't worry. Keep it.

1432
01:49:53,754 --> 01:49:55,734
I'm sure you have other expenses.

1433
01:49:55,990 --> 01:50:00,166
Yeah, I do...if you come along.

1434
01:50:00,227 --> 01:50:01,672
Will you?

1435
01:50:02,262 --> 01:50:04,799
l...can't come now.

1436
01:50:05,533 --> 01:50:07,274
He'll be here till Monday.

1437
01:50:07,968 --> 01:50:09,606
After that

1438
01:50:16,910 --> 01:50:18,787
Say something dirty.

1439
01:50:20,948 --> 01:50:22,552
What was it?

1440
01:50:23,050 --> 01:50:24,154
If..

1441
01:50:24,218 --> 01:50:26,926
If you bite I'll slap you tight.

1442
01:50:51,178 --> 01:50:54,716
Keep the money.

1443
01:50:55,716 --> 01:50:58,094
I was supposed to get 25 million.

1444
01:50:58,519 --> 01:51:01,728
But Raghu killed
my partner and his wife.

1445
01:51:01,789 --> 01:51:03,063
Now watch what I do to him....

1446
01:51:03,123 --> 01:51:05,865
Don't do anything.
Wait..

1447
01:51:07,862 --> 01:51:09,102
I committed a murder.

1448
01:51:10,297 --> 01:51:12,004
I am a convicted killer.

1449
01:51:12,699 --> 01:51:17,773
If you ever hit her again,
I will kill you. Goodnight.

1450
01:51:47,635 --> 01:51:49,979
Where are you going?

1451
01:51:50,237 --> 01:51:51,807
Cleaning my house.

1452
01:51:52,139 --> 01:51:53,846
What brings you here?

1453
01:51:54,976 --> 01:51:56,512
I'd like a cup of tea.

1454
01:52:02,749 --> 01:52:06,959
You didn't tell me that
you went to Harman's home too.

1455
01:52:07,288 --> 01:52:09,859
Fingerprints. Perfect match.

1456
01:52:09,957 --> 01:52:11,800
They invited me for lunch.

1457
01:52:12,026 --> 01:52:15,166
You get a lot of
invitations for lunch.

1458
01:52:21,568 --> 01:52:23,980
Where's the money?
- What money?

1459
01:52:24,171 --> 01:52:26,242
Don't play that game with me.

1460
01:52:26,673 --> 01:52:28,653
Liak's share of money.

1461
01:52:29,309 --> 01:52:31,311
From the bank robbery

1462
01:52:32,279 --> 01:52:35,317
You're clearly visible
in the CC camera at Aundh signal.

1463
01:52:35,649 --> 01:52:37,629
In Harman's car.

1464
01:52:37,918 --> 01:52:40,694
You murdered Harman and his wife.

1465
01:52:49,496 --> 01:52:51,100
What will you prove in the court?

1466
01:52:51,899 --> 01:52:54,505
That l, whose wife
and kid were killed..

1467
01:52:54,769 --> 01:52:58,615
..first pardoned Liak,
and then murdered his partner.

1468
01:52:59,273 --> 01:53:00,775
For money?

1469
01:53:02,242 --> 01:53:03,812
Sugar?

1470
01:53:07,247 --> 01:53:09,227
You might escape death sentence.

1471
01:53:09,283 --> 01:53:11,194
But jail term is guaranteed.

1472
01:53:13,620 --> 01:53:15,691
Give me the money...

1473
01:53:16,657 --> 01:53:18,136
...I'll erase all evidence.

1474
01:53:19,593 --> 01:53:21,004
Or else..

1475
01:53:21,629 --> 01:53:22,903
Looking for your retirement fund.

1476
01:53:29,069 --> 01:53:30,139
Call it what you may.

1477
01:53:32,773 --> 01:53:34,548
I'm retiring on Monday.

1478
01:53:35,309 --> 01:53:39,553
You have until Monday, 11 o'clock.

1479
01:54:16,817 --> 01:54:20,287
These clays I've no clue
about your whereabouts.

1480
01:54:20,787 --> 01:54:22,562
You're just like your father.

1481
01:54:25,592 --> 01:54:26,900
Go have your dinner,

1482
01:54:40,174 --> 01:54:43,644
You always curse my father.

1483
01:54:46,213 --> 01:54:48,193
There must be something
good about him.

1484
01:54:50,150 --> 01:54:51,561
Tell me.

1485
01:54:54,921 --> 01:54:56,195
What do I say?

1486
01:54:56,256 --> 01:54:58,566
There must be
something good about him.

1487
01:55:00,227 --> 01:55:03,504
Why are you trying
to stir up the past.

1488
01:55:04,631 --> 01:55:05,871
Forget it.

1489
01:55:07,501 --> 01:55:08,878
Forget it.

1490
01:55:21,215 --> 01:55:24,025
I specifically said
a bouquet worth 500 rupees...

1491
01:55:24,718 --> 01:55:26,755
What's going on?
What's all this?

1492
01:55:26,820 --> 01:55:29,528
Sir, it's your send-off today.

1493
01:55:29,990 --> 01:55:31,628
Good.

1494
01:55:32,025 --> 01:55:33,766
ls it clone?

1495
01:55:34,094 --> 01:55:35,732
Liak, listen.

1496
01:55:37,531 --> 01:55:39,738
Go back to your stall.
Stop following me.

1497
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:41,473
Get back to the stall.
- Listen.

1498
01:55:42,769 --> 01:55:44,043
Liak.

1499
01:55:49,476 --> 01:55:51,513
If anyone asks if there's
something good about your son..

1500
01:55:53,013 --> 01:55:55,516
..so you will tell them,
won't you?

1501
01:55:55,582 --> 01:55:56,652
Please do.

1502
01:55:59,119 --> 01:56:00,564
Yes, sir.

1503
01:56:01,655 --> 01:56:02,861
My last clay at work today.

1504
01:56:04,024 --> 01:56:06,664
What have you decided?
- You won't get the money.

1505
01:56:06,727 --> 01:56:07,865
Congratulations
for your retirement.

1506
01:56:07,961 --> 01:56:09,531
Don't be smart.

1507
01:56:09,696 --> 01:56:12,267
lam coming there.
- Do what you want.

1508
01:56:14,734 --> 01:56:15,712
Where's my driver?

1509
01:56:15,769 --> 01:56:18,249
Sir, he's gone home
to fetch your family.

1510
01:56:18,505 --> 01:56:20,849
Come on, get the car.
- Sir, please don't go.

1511
01:56:20,941 --> 01:56:23,785
It's a small program.
- I'll be back soon.

1512
01:56:27,581 --> 01:56:30,528
I killed Harman and his wife.

1513
01:56:31,885 --> 01:56:33,193
What?

1514
01:56:33,253 --> 01:56:35,130
I killed those two.

1515
01:56:35,188 --> 01:56:38,226
I barged in their bedroom.

1516
01:56:39,660 --> 01:56:41,469
Covered the floor with plastic..

1517
01:56:41,929 --> 01:56:44,842
..and hammered them to death.
They're both dead.

1518
01:56:44,932 --> 01:56:47,503
He said he won't give me my share.

1519
01:56:48,568 --> 01:56:50,605
He refused to recognize me.

1520
01:56:50,670 --> 01:56:53,913
The bodies are at
Khadakvasla sector 3.

1521
01:56:56,576 --> 01:56:58,487
I know you didn't commit the murders.

1522
01:56:58,512 --> 01:56:59,752
What's your game?

1523
01:57:02,016 --> 01:57:03,222
Tell me.

1524
01:57:05,252 --> 01:57:06,754
Say you didn't kill them.

1525
01:57:11,158 --> 01:57:13,035
Say you didn't kill them.

1526
01:57:16,763 --> 01:57:18,504
Say you didn't kill them!

1527
01:57:20,233 --> 01:57:21,837
You didn't kill them!

1528
01:57:22,736 --> 01:57:25,717
Say you didn't kill them!
Say it!

1529
01:57:25,772 --> 01:57:27,217
Say you didn't kill them!

1530
01:57:27,707 --> 01:57:30,119
You didn't kill them!

1531
01:57:31,011 --> 01:57:32,786
Say you didn't kill them!

1532
01:57:34,014 --> 01:57:35,152
Please move back.

1533
01:57:35,215 --> 01:57:36,216
Please move back.

1534
01:57:37,550 --> 01:57:40,030
Sir, you finally solved
a 15 year old case....

1535
01:57:40,086 --> 01:57:42,896
On the clay of your retirement.
How do you feel? Please tell us.

1536
01:57:42,990 --> 01:57:43,559
Feeling good.

1537
01:57:43,623 --> 01:57:45,534
It's a historic clay for you, sir.
How do you feel?

1538
01:57:45,592 --> 01:57:46,696
Was Liak taken to jail?

1539
01:57:46,760 --> 01:57:49,206
How will you recover the stolen money?

1540
01:57:49,262 --> 01:57:52,641
By selling Konkan Queen,
or do you have another option?

1541
01:57:52,699 --> 01:57:55,009
How long will he be sentenced to now?

1542
01:57:55,068 --> 01:57:56,547
Please sir...p
ease.

1543
01:57:56,570 --> 01:57:59,551
Please tell us...please..

1544
01:57:59,573 --> 01:58:00,711
Sir..

1545
01:58:10,284 --> 01:58:11,558
Pick that up, take it.

1546
01:58:21,595 --> 01:58:23,575
Pawan, I asked you to get cigarettes.

1547
01:58:23,597 --> 01:58:26,339
I've got it. - Did you?

1548
01:58:34,141 --> 01:58:36,143
I had a great time in Bangkok.

1549
01:58:40,347 --> 01:58:42,190
He committed two murders.

1550
01:58:58,131 --> 01:58:59,804
You didn't go today either.

1551
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,276
I've told you many times.
Chemo will help you relieve the pain.

1552
01:59:03,170 --> 01:59:04,808
And what happened last night?

1553
01:59:04,871 --> 01:59:06,646
You fainted again, didn't you?

1554
01:59:06,707 --> 01:59:10,177
No, it was just..
I pretend to be in pain.

1555
01:59:11,111 --> 01:59:13,853
So they give me some weed.

1556
01:59:15,148 --> 01:59:16,752
Why are you working on a Sunday?

1557
01:59:16,817 --> 01:59:18,819
Nobody else is.

1558
01:59:18,885 --> 01:59:21,991
I make one chair in four clays.

1559
01:59:22,055 --> 01:59:26,003
And outside it sells
for...3000 rupees.

1560
01:59:29,229 --> 01:59:33,336
You're good at it,
keep this one for me.

1561
01:59:34,567 --> 01:59:36,569
Will you get me a discount?

1562
02:00:07,234 --> 02:00:09,578
Your wife and kid's killer is dead.

1563
02:00:09,636 --> 02:00:10,808
I know.

1564
02:00:11,805 --> 02:00:15,150
So you must know...why he
turned himself over to the police?

1565
02:00:15,709 --> 02:00:17,814
Took the blame for your crimes.

1566
02:00:20,313 --> 02:00:22,224
To give you a second chance.

1567
02:00:24,284 --> 02:00:26,059
Everyone doesn't get a second chance.

1568
02:00:26,119 --> 02:00:28,156
Liak didn't get it, I didn't.

1569
02:00:28,855 --> 02:00:30,562
But you did.

1570
02:00:30,891 --> 02:00:32,302
Don't waste it.

1571
02:00:37,597 --> 02:00:38,769
And anyway"-

1572
02:00:40,733 --> 02:00:42,508
...you got your revenge.

1573
02:00:43,503 --> 02:00:44,277
So, what will you do now?

1574
02:00:44,771 --> 02:00:51,518
"Let me ward off your bad luck."

1575
02:00:51,544 --> 02:00:57,927
"And bless you with good luck."

1576
02:00:57,984 --> 02:01:04,902
"Take me away this time."

1577
02:01:04,992 --> 02:01:12,137
"Because my breath feels lost."

1578
02:01:12,899 --> 02:01:16,278
"I wish to...die today!"

1579
02:01:16,536 --> 02:01:20,040
"I wish to...die today!"

1580
02:01:20,106 --> 02:01:27,251
"I wish to...die today!"

1581
02:01:48,502 --> 02:01:51,540
"Rip mY body apart."

1582
02:01:51,605 --> 02:01:55,018
"Rip mY body apart."

1583
02:01:55,074 --> 02:01:58,112
"Rip mY body apart."

1584
02:01:58,178 --> 02:02:00,818
"Pump those bullets
in my heart, because.."

1585
02:02:00,881 --> 02:02:03,725
"I wish to...die today!"

1586
02:02:03,783 --> 02:02:07,287
"I wish to...die today!"

1587
02:02:07,520 --> 02:02:14,062
"I wish to...die today!"

1588
02:02:14,628 --> 02:02:18,132
"Make my life hell."

1589
02:02:18,198 --> 02:02:21,179
"Make my life hell."

1590
02:02:21,234 --> 02:02:24,545
"Make my life hell."

1591
02:02:24,604 --> 02:02:27,210
"I want to die with a smile."

1592
02:02:27,273 --> 02:02:30,083
"I wish to...die today!"

1593
02:02:30,143 --> 02:02:33,886
"I wish to...die today!"

1594
02:02:33,980 --> 02:02:40,556
"I wish to...die today!"

1595
02:02:57,237 --> 02:03:03,882
"Lord...summon me to
Your threshold someday."

1596
02:03:03,977 --> 02:03:07,151
"And give me the rest of the pain."

1597
02:03:07,214 --> 02:03:09,524
"And make my cry."

1598
02:03:09,549 --> 02:03:13,156
"I wish to.."

1599
02:03:16,123 --> 02:03:19,263
"I wish to.."

1600
02:03:19,526 --> 02:03:23,668
"I wish to.."

1601
02:03:23,730 --> 02:03:27,200
"For a single glimpse of you.."

1602
02:03:27,267 --> 02:03:30,646
"For a single glimpse of you.."

1603
02:03:30,704 --> 02:03:33,583
"For a single glimpse of you.."

1604
02:03:33,640 --> 02:03:36,052
"I can die a thousand times."

1605
02:03:36,109 --> 02:03:39,113
"I wish to...die today!"

1606
02:03:39,179 --> 02:03:42,786
"I wish to...die today!"

1607
02:03:42,849 --> 02:03:49,630
"I wish to...die today!"

1608
02:03:57,097 --> 02:04:03,707
